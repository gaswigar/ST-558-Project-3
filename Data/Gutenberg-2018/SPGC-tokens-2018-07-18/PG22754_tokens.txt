masters
of
space
by
edward
smith
everett
evans
illustrated
by
berry
the
masters
had
ruled
all
space
with
an
unconquerable
iron
fist
but
the
masters
were
gone
and
this
new
young
race
who
came
now
to
take
their
place
could
they
hope
to
defeat
the
ancient
enemy
of
all
i
but
did
you
feel
javo
strain
was
apparent
in
every
line
of
tula
taut
bare
body
nothing
at
all
nothing
whatever
the
one
called
javo
relaxed
from
his
rigid
concentration
nothing
has
changed
nor
will
it
that
conclusion
is
indefensible
tula
snapped
with
the
promised
return
of
the
masters
there
must
and
will
be
changes
did
of
you
feel
anything
her
hot
demanding
eyes
swept
the
group
a
group
whose
like
except
for
physical
perfection
could
be
found
in
any
nudist
colony
no
one
except
tula
had
felt
a
thing
that
fact
is
not
too
surprising
javo
said
finally
you
have
the
most
sensitive
receptors
of
us
all
but
are
you
sure
i
am
sure
it
was
the
of
a
living
master
do
you
think
that
the
master
perceived
your
web
it
is
certain
those
who
built
us
are
stronger
than
we
that
is
true
as
they
promised
then
so
long
and
long
ago
our
masters
are
returning
home
to
us
jarvis
hilton
of
terra
the
youngest
man
yet
to
be
assigned
to
direct
any
such
tremendous
undertaking
as
project
theta
orionis
sat
in
conference
with
his
two
assistant
director
sandra
cummings
and
semantician
was
tall
blonde
and
svelte
planetographer
william
karns
a
man
of
thirty
was
third
in
rank
of
the
scientific
group
i
telling
you
jarve
you
ca
have
it
both
ways
karns
declared
captain
sawtelle
is
navy
brass
he
goes
strictly
by
the
book
so
you
got
to
draw
a
line
exactly
where
the
advisory
board
directive
puts
it
and
next
time
he
sticks
his
ugly
puss
across
that
line
kick
his
face
in
you
been
caspar
milquetoast
two
ever
since
we
left
base
that
the
way
it
looks
to
you
hilton
right
hand
became
a
fist
the
man
has
age
experience
and
ability
i
been
trying
to
meet
him
on
a
ground
of
courtesy
and
decency
exactly
and
he
does
recognize
the
existence
of
either
and
since
the
board
rammed
you
down
his
throat
instead
of
giving
him
old
jeffers
you
need
expect
him
to
you
may
be
right
bill
what
do
you
think
dr
cummings
the
girl
said
bill
right
also
your
constant
appeasement
doing
the
morale
of
the
whole
scientific
group
a
bit
of
good
well
i
have
enjoyed
it
either
so
next
time
i
pin
his
ears
back
anything
else
yes
hilton
i
have
a
squawk
of
my
own
i
know
i
was
rammed
down
your
throat
but
just
when
are
you
going
to
let
me
do
some
work
none
of
us
has
much
of
anything
to
do
yet
and
wo
have
until
we
light
somewhere
you
off
base
a
country
mile
i
not
off
base
you
want
eggleston
not
me
sure
i
did
i
worked
with
him
and
know
what
he
can
do
but
i
not
holding
a
grudge
about
it
no
why
then
are
you
on
terms
with
everyone
in
the
scientific
group
except
me
supposedly
your
first
assistant
that
easy
hilton
snapped
because
you
been
carrying
chips
on
both
shoulders
ever
since
you
came
aboard
or
at
least
i
thought
you
were
hilton
grinned
suddenly
and
held
out
his
hand
sorry
sandy
i
start
all
over
again
i
sorry
too
chief
they
shook
hands
warmly
i
pretty
stiff
i
guess
but
i
be
good
you
go
to
work
right
now
too
as
semantician
dig
out
that
directive
and
tear
it
down
draw
that
line
bill
talked
about
can
do
boss
she
swung
to
her
feet
and
walked
out
of
the
room
her
every
movement
one
of
lithe
and
easy
grace
karns
followed
her
with
his
eyes
funny
a
and
a
miss
america
type
like
all
the
other
women
aboard
this
spacer
i
wonder
if
she
make
out
so
do
i
still
wish
they
given
me
eggy
i
never
seen
an
female
yet
that
was
worth
the
cyanide
it
would
take
to
poison
her
that
what
sawtelle
thinks
of
you
too
you
know
i
know
and
the
board
know
its
stuff
so
i
really
hoping
bill
that
she
surprises
me
as
much
as
i
intend
to
surprise
the
navy
alarm
bells
clanged
as
the
mighty
blinked
out
of
overdrive
every
crewman
sprang
to
his
post
mister
snowden
why
did
we
emerge
without
orders
from
me
captain
sawtelle
bellowed
storming
into
the
control
room
three
jumps
behind
hilton
the
automatics
took
control
sir
he
said
quietly
automatics
i
the
orders
in
this
case
captain
sawtelle
you
do
hilton
said
eyes
locked
and
held
to
sawtelle
this
was
a
new
and
strange
i
would
suggest
that
we
discuss
this
matter
in
private
very
well
sir
sawtelle
said
and
in
the
captain
cabin
hilton
opened
up
for
your
information
captain
sawtelle
i
set
my
coupling
detectors
for
any
objective
i
choose
when
any
one
of
them
reacts
it
trips
the
kickers
and
we
emerge
during
any
emergency
outside
the
solar
system
i
am
in
command
with
the
provision
that
i
must
relinquish
command
to
you
in
case
of
armed
attack
on
us
where
do
you
think
you
found
any
such
stuff
as
that
in
the
directive
it
is
there
and
i
know
my
rights
it
is
and
you
do
here
is
a
semantic
chart
of
the
whole
directive
as
you
will
note
it
overrides
many
navy
regulations
disobedience
of
my
orders
constitutes
mutiny
and
i
can
and
will
have
you
put
in
irons
and
sent
back
to
terra
for
now
let
go
back
in
the
control
room
hilton
said
the
target
has
a
mass
of
approximately
five
hundred
metric
tons
there
is
also
a
significant
amount
of
radiation
characteristic
of
uranexite
you
will
please
execute
search
captain
sawtelle
and
captain
sawtelle
ordered
the
search
what
did
you
do
to
the
big
jerk
boss
sandra
whispered
what
you
and
bill
suggested
hilton
whispered
back
thanks
to
your
analysis
of
the
directive
pure
gobbledygook
if
there
ever
was
any
i
could
mighty
good
job
sandy
ten
or
fifteen
more
minutes
passed
then
here
the
source
of
radiation
sir
a
searchman
reported
it
a
point
source
though
not
an
object
at
this
range
and
here
the
artifact
sir
pilot
snowden
said
we
coming
up
on
it
fast
but
but
what
a
skeleton
doing
out
here
in
interstellar
space
as
they
closed
up
everyone
could
see
that
the
thing
did
indeed
look
like
the
metallic
skeleton
of
a
great
building
it
was
a
huge
cube
measuring
well
over
a
hundred
yards
along
each
edge
and
it
was
empty
one
for
the
book
sawtelle
said
and
how
hilton
agreed
i
take
a
boat
no
suits
would
be
better
karns
yarborough
get
techs
leeds
and
miller
and
suit
up
you
need
a
boat
escort
sawtelle
said
ashley
execute
escort
landing
craft
one
two
and
three
the
three
landing
craft
approached
that
enigmatic
of
structural
steel
and
stopped
five
grotesquely
armored
figures
wafted
themselves
forward
on
pencils
of
force
their
leader
whose
suit
bore
the
number
reached
a
mammoth
girder
and
worked
his
way
along
it
up
to
a
bulge
the
whole
immense
structure
vanished
leaving
men
and
boats
in
empty
space
sawtelle
gasped
snowden
are
you
holding
no
sir
faster
than
light
hyperspace
sir
ashby
did
you
have
your
interspace
rigs
set
no
sir
i
did
think
of
it
sir
doctor
cummings
why
were
yours
out
i
did
think
of
such
a
thing
either
any
more
than
you
did
sandra
said
ashby
the
communications
officer
had
been
working
the
radio
no
reply
from
anyone
sir
he
reported
oh
no
sandra
exclaimed
then
but
look
they
firing
pistols
especially
the
one
wearing
number
fourteen
but
recoil
pistols
for
emergency
use
in
case
of
power
failure
ashby
explained
that
it
but
i
ca
see
why
their
power
went
out
at
once
but
fourteen
that
hilton
is
really
doing
a
job
with
that
he
be
here
in
a
couple
of
minutes
and
he
was
every
power
unit
out
there
suits
and
boats
both
drained
hilton
reported
drained
get
some
help
out
there
fast
in
an
enormous
structure
deep
below
the
surface
of
a
world
a
group
of
technicians
clustered
together
in
front
of
one
section
of
a
long
control
board
they
were
staring
at
a
light
that
had
just
appeared
where
no
light
should
have
been
someone
will
be
burned
out
for
this
one
of
the
group
radiated
harshly
that
unit
was
inactivated
long
ago
and
it
has
not
been
reactivated
someone
committed
an
error
your
loftiness
silence
fool
stretts
do
not
commit
errors
as
soon
as
it
was
clear
that
no
one
had
been
injured
sawtelle
demanded
how
about
it
hilton
structurally
it
was
steel
there
were
many
bulges
possibly
containing
mechanisms
there
were
of
a
type
there
were
many
projectors
which
at
a
rough
guess
were
a
hundred
times
as
powerful
as
any
i
have
ever
seen
before
there
were
no
indications
that
the
thing
had
ever
been
enclosed
in
whole
or
in
part
it
certainly
never
had
living
quarters
for
eaters
of
organic
food
sawtelle
snorted
you
mean
it
never
had
a
crew
not
necessarily
bah
what
other
kind
of
intelligent
life
is
there
i
do
know
but
before
we
speculate
too
much
let
look
at
the
the
camera
may
have
caught
something
i
missed
it
had
the
pictures
added
nothing
it
probably
was
operated
either
by
programmed
automatics
or
by
remote
control
hilton
decided
finally
but
how
did
they
drain
all
our
power
and
just
as
bad
what
and
how
is
that
other
point
source
of
power
we
heading
for
now
what
wrong
with
it
sawtelle
asked
its
strength
no
matter
what
distance
or
reactant
i
assume
nothing
we
know
will
fit
neither
fission
nor
fusion
will
do
it
it
has
to
be
practically
total
conversion
ii
the
snapped
out
of
overdrive
near
the
point
of
interest
and
hilton
stared
motionless
and
silent
space
was
full
of
madly
warring
ships
half
of
them
were
bare
giant
skeletons
of
steel
like
the
derelict
that
had
so
unexpectedly
blasted
away
from
them
the
others
were
more
or
less
like
the
except
in
being
bigger
faster
and
of
vastly
greater
power
beams
of
starkly
incredible
power
bit
at
and
clung
to
equally
capable
defensive
screens
of
pure
force
as
these
inconceivable
forces
met
the
glare
of
their
neutralization
filled
all
nearby
space
and
ships
and
skeletons
alike
were
disappearing
in
chunks
blobs
gouts
streamers
and
sparkles
of
rended
fused
and
vaporized
metal
hilton
watched
two
ships
combine
against
one
skeleton
dozens
of
beams
incredibly
tight
and
hard
were
held
inexorably
upon
dozens
of
the
bulges
of
the
skeleton
overloaded
the
bulges
screens
flared
through
the
spectrum
and
failed
and
bare
metal
however
refractory
endures
only
for
instants
under
the
appalling
intensity
of
such
beams
as
those
the
skeletons
tried
to
duplicate
the
ships
method
of
attack
but
failed
they
were
too
slow
not
slow
exactly
either
but
hesitant
as
though
it
required
whole
seconds
for
the
commander
or
operator
or
remote
controller
of
each
skeleton
to
make
it
act
the
ships
were
winning
hey
hilton
yelped
oh
that
the
one
we
saw
back
there
but
what
in
all
space
does
it
think
it
doing
it
was
plunging
at
tremendous
speed
straight
through
the
immense
fleet
of
embattled
skeletons
it
did
not
fire
a
beam
nor
energize
a
screen
it
merely
plunged
along
as
though
on
a
plotted
course
until
it
collided
with
one
of
the
skeletons
of
the
fleet
and
both
structures
plunged
a
tangled
mass
of
wreckage
to
the
ground
of
the
planet
below
then
hundreds
of
the
ships
shot
forward
each
to
plunge
into
and
explode
inside
one
of
the
skeletons
when
visibility
was
restored
another
wave
of
ships
came
forward
to
repeat
the
performance
but
there
was
nothing
left
to
fight
every
surviving
skeleton
had
blinked
out
of
normal
space
the
remaining
ships
made
no
effort
to
pursue
the
skeletons
nor
did
they
as
a
fleet
each
ship
went
off
by
itself
and
on
that
distant
planet
of
the
stretts
the
group
of
mechs
watched
with
amazed
disbelief
as
light
after
light
after
light
winked
out
on
their
control
board
frantically
they
relayed
orders
to
the
skeletons
orders
which
did
not
affect
the
losses
will
blacken
for
this
a
mental
snarl
began
to
be
interrupted
by
a
coldly
imperious
thought
that
unit
so
inexplicably
reactivated
is
approaching
the
fuel
world
it
is
ignoring
the
battle
it
is
heading
through
our
fleet
toward
the
oman
half
it
it
does
not
respond
your
loftiness
then
blast
it
fool
ah
it
is
inactivated
as
encyclopedist
nine
explain
the
freakish
behavior
of
that
unit
yes
your
loftiness
many
cycles
ago
we
sent
a
ship
against
the
omans
with
a
new
device
of
destruction
the
omans
must
have
intercepted
it
drained
it
of
power
and
allowed
it
to
drift
on
after
all
these
cycles
of
time
it
must
have
come
upon
a
small
source
of
power
and
of
course
continued
its
mission
that
can
be
the
truth
the
lords
of
the
universe
must
be
informed
the
mining
units
the
carriers
and
the
refiners
have
not
been
affected
your
loftiness
a
mech
radiated
so
i
see
fool
then
activating
another
instrument
his
loftiness
thought
at
it
in
an
entirely
different
vein
lord
ynos
madam
i
have
to
make
a
very
grave
report
in
the
four
scientists
and
three
navy
officers
were
arguing
heatedly
employing
verbiage
not
to
be
found
in
any
dictionary
jarve
karns
called
out
and
hilton
joined
the
group
does
anything
about
this
planet
make
any
sense
to
you
no
but
you
the
planetographer
with
it
it
a
good
three
hundred
degrees
kelvin
too
hot
well
you
know
it
loaded
with
uranexite
that
much
the
whole
crust
practically
jewelry
ore
if
that
what
the
figures
say
i
buy
it
buy
then
continuous
daylight
everywhere
noon
june
light
that
it
all
in
the
visible
frank
says
it
from
bombardment
of
a
layer
of
something
and
frank
admits
that
the
whole
thing
impossible
when
frank
makes
up
his
mind
what
is
i
take
it
as
a
datum
third
thing
there
only
one
city
on
this
continent
and
protected
by
a
screen
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
hilton
pondered
then
turned
to
the
captain
will
you
please
run
a
sir
only
the
hot
spots
the
planet
was
approximately
the
same
size
as
terra
its
atmosphere
except
for
its
intense
radiation
was
similar
to
terra
there
were
two
continents
one
immense
girdling
ocean
the
temperature
of
the
land
surface
was
everywhere
about
that
of
the
water
about
each
continent
had
one
city
and
both
were
small
one
was
inhabited
by
what
looked
like
human
beings
the
other
by
usuform
robots
the
human
city
was
the
only
cool
spot
on
the
entire
planet
under
its
protective
dome
the
temperature
was
hilton
decided
to
study
the
robots
first
and
asked
the
captain
to
take
the
ship
down
to
observation
range
sawtelle
objected
and
continued
to
object
until
hilton
started
to
order
his
arrest
then
he
said
i
do
it
under
protest
but
i
want
it
on
record
that
i
am
doing
it
against
my
best
judgment
it
on
record
hilton
said
coldly
everything
said
and
done
is
being
and
will
continue
to
be
recorded
the
floated
downward
what
i
want
most
to
see
hilton
said
finally
that
big
operation
that
it
hold
it
then
via
attention
all
scientists
you
all
know
what
to
do
start
doing
it
sandra
blonde
head
was
very
close
to
hilton
brown
one
as
they
both
stared
into
hilton
plate
why
they
look
like
giant
armadillos
she
exclaimed
more
like
tanks
he
disagreed
except
that
they
got
legs
wheels
treads
and
arms
cutters
diggers
probes
and
conveyors
and
at
the
way
those
buckets
dip
solid
rock
the
fantastic
machine
was
moving
very
slowly
along
a
bench
or
shelf
that
it
was
making
for
itself
as
it
went
along
below
it
to
its
left
dropped
other
benches
being
made
by
other
mining
machines
the
machines
were
not
using
explosives
hard
though
the
ore
was
the
tools
were
so
much
harder
and
were
driven
with
such
tremendous
power
that
the
stuff
might
just
have
well
have
been
sand
every
bit
of
loosened
ore
down
to
the
finest
dust
was
forced
into
a
conveyor
and
thence
into
the
armored
body
of
the
machine
there
it
went
into
a
mechanism
whose
basic
principles
hilton
could
not
understand
from
this
monstrosity
emerged
two
streams
of
product
one
of
these
comprising
point
nine
plus
percent
of
the
input
went
out
through
another
conveyor
into
the
vast
hold
of
a
vehicle
which
when
full
and
replaced
by
a
duplicate
of
itself
went
careening
madly
to
a
dump
the
other
product
a
slow
very
small
stream
of
tiny
glistening
black
pellets
fell
into
a
container
being
held
watchfully
by
a
small
machine
more
or
less
like
a
motor
scooter
which
was
moving
carefully
along
beside
the
giant
miner
when
this
can
was
almost
full
another
scooter
rolled
up
and
without
losing
a
single
pellet
took
over
place
and
function
the
first
scooter
then
covered
its
bucket
clamped
it
solidly
into
a
recess
designed
for
the
purpose
and
dashed
away
toward
the
city
illustration
hilton
stared
at
sandra
she
stared
back
do
you
make
anything
of
that
jarve
nothing
they
taking
uranexite
and
or
converting
it
a
thousand
to
one
i
we
be
able
to
do
something
about
it
i
hope
so
too
chief
and
i
we
will
well
that
enough
for
now
you
may
take
us
up
now
captain
sawtelle
and
sandy
will
you
please
call
all
department
heads
and
their
assistants
into
the
conference
room
at
the
head
of
the
long
conference
table
hilton
studied
his
fourteen
department
heads
all
husky
young
men
and
their
assistants
all
surprisingly
attractive
and
young
women
bud
carroll
and
sylvia
bannister
of
sociology
sat
together
he
was
almost
as
big
as
karns
she
was
a
redhead
whose
and
would
have
looked
big
except
for
the
arrangement
thereof
there
were
bernadine
and
hermione
van
der
moen
the
leggy
breasty
twins
both
of
whom
were
cowper
medalists
in
physics
there
was
etienne
de
vaux
the
mathematical
wizard
and
rebecca
eisenstein
the
theoretical
astronomer
there
was
beverly
bell
who
made
mathematically
impossible
chemical
syntheses
who
swam
channels
for
days
on
end
and
computed
planetary
orbits
in
her
head
first
we
have
a
hilton
said
nothing
recorded
just
to
get
acquainted
you
all
know
that
our
fourteen
departments
cover
science
from
astronomy
to
zoology
he
paused
again
his
eyes
swept
the
group
stella
wing
who
would
have
been
a
star
except
for
her
drive
to
know
everything
about
language
theodora
teddy
blake
who
would
prove
gleefully
that
she
was
the
world
best
model
but
was
in
fact
the
most
brilliantly
promising
theoretician
who
had
ever
lived
no
other
force
like
this
has
ever
been
assembled
hilton
went
on
in
more
ways
than
one
sawtelle
wanted
jeffers
to
head
this
group
instead
of
me
everybody
thought
he
head
it
and
hilton
wanted
eggleston
and
got
sandra
said
that
right
and
quite
a
few
of
you
did
want
to
come
at
all
but
were
told
by
the
board
to
come
or
else
the
group
stirred
eyes
met
eyes
and
there
were
smiles
i
myself
think
jeffers
have
had
the
job
i
never
handled
anything
half
this
big
and
i
need
a
lot
of
help
but
i
stuck
with
it
and
you
all
stuck
with
me
so
we
all
take
it
and
like
it
you
noticed
of
course
the
accent
on
youth
the
navy
crew
is
normal
except
for
the
commanders
being
unusually
young
but
we
are
none
of
us
is
thirty
yet
and
none
of
us
has
ever
been
married
you
fellows
look
like
a
team
of
professional
athletes
and
you
girls
well
if
i
know
better
i
say
the
board
had
screened
you
for
the
front
row
of
the
chorus
instead
of
for
a
how
they
found
so
many
of
you
i
never
know
virile
men
and
nubile
women
etienne
de
vaux
leered
enthusiastically
le
board
nubile
bravo
tiny
delicatesse
de
nuance
three
rousing
cheers
for
the
board
keep
still
you
nitwits
let
me
ask
a
question
this
came
from
one
of
the
twins
before
you
give
us
the
deduction
jarvis
or
will
it
be
an
intuition
or
an
induction
or
a
or
an
inducement
the
other
twin
suggested
helpfully
not
that
would
need
very
much
of
that
you
keep
still
too
miney
i
asking
sir
moderator
if
i
can
give
my
deduction
first
sure
bernadine
go
ahead
they
figured
we
going
to
get
completely
lost
then
we
jettison
the
navy
hunt
up
a
planet
of
our
own
and
start
a
race
to
end
all
human
races
or
would
you
call
this
a
instead
of
a
this
produced
a
storm
of
whistles
cheers
and
jeers
that
it
took
several
seconds
to
quell
but
seriously
jarvis
bernadine
went
on
we
all
been
wondering
and
it
does
make
sense
have
you
any
idea
at
all
of
what
the
board
actually
did
have
in
mind
i
believe
that
the
board
selected
for
mental
not
physical
qualities
for
the
ability
to
handle
anything
unexpected
or
unusual
that
comes
up
no
matter
what
it
is
you
think
it
was
asked
kincaid
the
psychologist
he
smiled
quizzically
that
all
this
virility
and
nubility
and
glamor
is
pure
coincidence
no
hilton
said
with
an
almost
imperceptible
flick
of
an
eyelid
coincidence
is
as
meaningless
as
paradox
i
think
they
found
out
that
barring
freaks
the
best
minds
are
in
the
best
bodies
could
be
the
idea
has
been
propounded
before
now
let
get
to
work
hilton
flipped
the
switch
of
the
recorder
starting
with
you
sandy
each
of
you
give
a
what
you
found
and
what
you
think
something
over
an
hour
later
the
meeting
adjourned
and
hilton
and
sandra
strolled
toward
the
control
room
i
do
know
whether
you
convinced
alexander
kincaid
or
not
but
you
did
quite
convince
me
sandra
said
nor
him
either
oh
sandra
eyebrows
no
he
grabbed
the
out
i
offered
him
i
did
fool
teddy
blake
or
temple
bells
either
you
four
are
all
though
i
think
temple
you
think
so
smart
i
do
so
no
do
fool
yourself
chick
temple
bells
looks
and
acts
sweet
and
innocent
and
virginal
maybe
probably
she
is
but
she
is
showing
a
fraction
of
the
stuff
she
really
got
she
heavy
artillery
sandy
and
i
mean
i
think
you
slightly
nuts
there
but
do
you
really
believe
that
the
board
was
playing
cupid
not
trying
but
doing
and
efficiently
yes
but
it
would
we
are
going
to
get
lost
we
wo
need
to
propinquity
will
do
the
work
phooie
you
and
me
for
instance
she
stopped
put
both
hands
on
her
hips
and
glared
why
i
would
marry
if
you
i
tell
the
cockeyed
world
you
wo
hilton
broke
in
me
marry
a
damned
female
mine
will
be
a
cuddly
little
brunette
that
thinks
a
slipstick
is
some
kind
of
lipstick
and
that
an
something
good
to
eat
one
like
that
copy
of
murchison
dark
lady
that
you
keep
under
the
glass
on
your
desk
she
sneered
exactly
he
started
to
continue
the
battle
then
shut
himself
off
but
listen
sandy
why
should
we
get
into
a
fight
because
we
do
want
to
marry
each
other
you
doing
a
swell
job
i
admire
you
tremendously
for
it
and
i
like
to
work
with
you
you
got
a
point
there
jarve
at
that
and
i
one
of
the
few
who
know
what
kind
of
a
job
doing
so
i
relax
she
flashed
him
a
gamin
grin
and
they
went
on
into
the
control
room
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
then
to
do
any
more
exploring
but
the
next
morning
early
the
lined
out
for
the
city
of
the
humanoids
tula
turned
toward
her
fellows
her
eyes
filled
with
a
happily
triumphant
light
and
her
thought
a
lilting
song
i
have
been
telling
you
from
the
first
touch
that
it
was
the
masters
it
the
masters
the
masters
are
returning
to
us
omans
and
their
own
home
world
captain
sawtelle
hilton
said
please
land
in
the
cradle
below
sawtelle
stormed
on
a
planet
like
not
by
he
broke
off
and
stared
for
now
on
that
cradle
there
flamed
out
in
screaming
red
the
own
landing
symbols
your
protest
is
recorded
hilton
said
now
sir
land
fuming
sawtelle
landed
sandra
looked
pointedly
at
hilton
first
contact
is
my
dish
you
know
not
that
i
like
it
but
it
is
he
turned
to
a
burly
youth
with
hair
still
safe
frank
still
abnormally
low
surprising
no
end
since
all
the
rest
of
the
planet
is
hotter
than
the
middle
of
hell
okay
sandy
who
will
you
want
besides
the
top
linguists
psych
both
alex
and
temple
and
teddy
blake
they
over
there
tell
them
will
you
while
i
buzz
teddy
will
do
and
hilton
stepped
over
to
the
two
psychologists
and
told
them
then
i
hope
i
not
leading
with
my
chin
temple
but
is
that
your
real
first
name
or
a
professional
it
real
it
really
is
my
parents
were
romantics
dad
says
they
considered
both
and
not
at
all
obviously
he
studied
her
the
almost
translucent
unblemished
perfection
of
her
skin
the
clear
calm
deep
blueness
of
her
eyes
the
long
thick
mane
of
hair
exactly
the
color
of
a
field
of
wheat
you
know
i
like
it
he
said
then
it
fits
you
i
glad
you
said
that
doctor
not
that
temple
i
not
going
to
you
i
call
you
then
like
stella
does
anyway
that
lets
me
tell
you
that
i
like
it
myself
i
really
think
that
it
did
something
for
me
did
something
for
you
that
for
sure
i
mighty
glad
you
aboard
and
i
hope
here
they
come
hi
hark
hi
stella
hi
jarve
said
chief
linguist
harkins
and
hi
boss
what
holding
us
up
asked
his
assistant
stella
wing
she
was
about
five
feet
four
her
eyes
were
a
tawny
brown
her
hair
a
flamboyant
auburn
mop
perhaps
it
owed
a
little
of
its
spectacular
refulgence
to
chemistry
hilton
thought
but
not
too
much
let
us
away
let
the
lions
roar
and
let
the
welkin
ring
who
been
feeding
so
much
red
meat
little
squirt
hilton
laughed
and
turned
away
meeting
sandra
in
the
corridor
okay
chick
take
away
we
cover
you
luck
girl
and
in
the
control
room
to
sawtelle
cover
please
set
for
minimum
aperture
and
lethal
blast
but
no
firing
captain
sawtelle
until
i
give
the
order
the
was
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
natives
they
were
all
adult
all
naked
and
about
equally
divided
as
to
sex
they
were
friendly
most
enthusiastically
so
jarve
sandra
squealed
they
very
strongly
so
i
never
imagined
i
never
felt
anything
like
it
any
rough
stuff
hilton
demanded
oh
no
just
the
opposite
they
love
us
in
a
way
that
simply
indescribable
i
do
like
this
telepathy
business
not
clear
foggy
diffuse
this
woman
is
i
her
grandmother
or
something
slow
down
take
it
they
want
us
all
to
come
out
here
and
live
with
no
not
them
but
each
of
us
alone
in
a
whole
house
with
them
to
wait
on
us
but
first
they
all
want
to
come
aboard
hilton
yelped
but
are
you
they
friendly
positive
chief
how
about
you
alex
we
all
sure
jarve
no
question
about
it
bring
two
of
them
aboard
a
man
and
a
woman
you
wo
bring
sawtelle
thundered
hilton
i
had
enough
of
your
stupid
blundering
long
ago
but
this
utterly
idiotic
brainstorm
of
letting
enemy
aliens
aboard
us
ends
all
civilian
command
call
your
people
back
aboard
or
i
will
bring
them
in
by
force
very
well
sir
sandy
tell
the
natives
that
a
slight
delay
has
become
necessary
and
bring
your
party
aboard
the
navy
officers
smiled
or
grinned
gloatingly
while
the
scientists
stared
at
their
director
with
expressions
ranging
from
surprise
to
disappointment
and
disgust
hilton
face
remained
set
expressionless
until
sandra
and
her
party
had
arrived
captain
sawtelle
he
said
then
i
thought
that
you
and
i
had
settled
in
private
the
question
or
who
is
in
command
of
project
theta
orionis
at
destination
we
will
now
settle
it
in
public
your
opinion
of
me
is
now
on
record
witnessed
by
your
officers
and
by
my
staff
my
opinion
of
you
which
is
now
being
similarly
recorded
and
witnessed
is
that
you
are
a
hidebound
mentally
ossified
navy
mule
mentally
and
psychologically
unfit
to
have
any
voice
in
any
such
mission
as
this
you
will
now
agree
on
this
recording
and
before
these
witnesses
to
obey
my
orders
unquestioningly
or
i
will
now
unload
all
bureau
of
science
personnel
and
equipment
onto
this
planet
and
send
you
and
the
back
to
terra
with
the
record
of
this
episode
posted
to
the
advisory
board
take
your
choice
eyes
locked
and
under
hilton
uncompromising
stare
sawtelle
weakened
he
fidgeted
tried
three
times
unsuccessfully
to
blare
defiance
then
very
well
sir
he
said
and
saluted
thank
you
sir
hilton
said
then
turned
to
his
staff
okay
sandy
go
ahead
outside
the
control
room
door
thank
god
you
do
play
poker
jarve
karns
gasped
we
all
owe
you
all
the
pay
we
ever
get
you
think
it
was
the
bluff
yes
de
vaux
asked
me
i
think
no
name
of
a
name
of
a
name
i
was
wondering
with
unease
what
life
would
be
like
on
this
planet
you
did
need
to
wonder
tiny
hilton
assured
him
it
was
in
the
bag
he
incapable
of
abandonment
beverly
bell
the
van
der
moen
twins
and
temple
bells
all
stared
at
hilton
in
awe
and
sandra
felt
much
the
same
way
but
suppose
he
called
you
sandra
demanded
speculating
on
the
impossible
is
unprofitable
he
said
oh
you
the
most
thing
sandra
stamped
a
foot
do
you
answer
a
question
intelligibly
when
the
question
is
meaningless
chick
i
ca
at
the
lock
temple
bells
who
had
been
hanging
back
cocked
an
eyebrow
at
hilton
and
he
made
his
way
to
her
side
what
was
it
you
started
to
say
back
there
boss
oh
yes
that
we
should
see
each
other
oftener
that
what
i
was
hoping
you
were
going
to
say
she
put
her
hand
under
his
elbow
and
pressed
his
arm
lightly
fleetingly
against
her
side
that
would
be
indubitably
the
fondest
thing
i
could
be
of
he
laughed
and
gave
her
arm
a
friendly
squeeze
then
he
studied
her
again
the
most
baffling
member
of
his
staff
about
five
feet
six
lithe
hard
trained
down
fine
as
a
tennis
champion
she
would
be
stacked
she
was
stacked
not
as
beautiful
as
sandra
or
teddy
but
with
an
ungodly
lot
of
something
that
neither
of
them
had
nor
any
other
woman
he
had
ever
known
yes
i
am
a
little
difficult
to
classify
she
said
quietly
almost
reading
his
mind
that
the
understatement
of
the
year
but
i
making
some
progress
such
as
this
was
an
open
challenge
except
possibly
teddy
the
best
brain
aboard
that
is
true
but
go
ahead
you
a
powerhouse
a
tightly
organized
thoroughly
integrated
smoothly
functioning
beautifully
camouflaged
juggernaut
a
reasonable
facsimile
of
an
irresistible
force
my
god
jarvis
that
had
gone
deep
let
me
finish
my
analysis
you
are
head
of
your
department
because
you
do
want
to
be
you
fooled
the
top
psychs
of
the
board
been
running
ninety
per
cent
submerged
because
you
can
work
better
that
way
and
there
no
blood
in
you
she
stared
at
him
licking
her
lips
i
knew
your
mind
was
a
razor
but
i
did
know
it
was
a
diamond
drill
too
that
seals
your
doom
boss
unless
no
you
ca
know
why
i
here
why
of
course
i
do
you
just
think
you
do
you
see
i
been
in
love
with
you
ever
since
as
a
gangling
bony
kid
i
listened
to
your
first
doctorate
disputation
ever
since
then
my
purpose
in
life
has
been
to
land
you
iii
but
listen
he
exclaimed
i
even
if
i
want
of
course
you
ca
pure
deviltry
danced
in
her
eyes
you
the
director
it
would
be
proper
but
it
standard
operating
procedure
for
simple
innocent
unsophisticated
little
country
girls
like
me
to
go
completely
overboard
for
the
boss
but
you
ca
you
he
protested
in
panic
temple
bells
was
getting
plenty
of
revenge
for
the
shocks
he
had
given
her
i
ca
watch
me
she
grinned
up
at
him
her
eyes
still
dancing
every
chance
i
get
i
going
to
hug
your
arm
like
i
did
a
minute
ago
and
you
take
hold
of
my
forearm
like
you
did
that
can
be
taken
you
see
as
either
one
a
reluctant
acceptance
of
a
mildly
distasteful
but
not
quite
actionable
situation
or
two
a
blocking
move
to
keep
me
from
climbing
up
you
like
a
squirrel
confound
it
temple
you
be
serious
ca
i
she
laughed
gleefully
especially
with
half
a
dozen
of
those
other
cats
watching
just
wait
and
see
boss
sandra
and
her
two
guests
came
aboard
the
natives
looked
around
the
man
at
the
various
human
men
the
woman
at
each
of
the
human
women
the
woman
remained
beside
sandra
the
man
took
his
place
at
hilton
left
looking
up
he
was
a
couple
of
inches
shorter
than
hilton
six
feet
one
with
an
air
of
of
why
this
arrangement
sandy
hilton
asked
because
we
tops
it
your
move
jarve
what
first
uranexite
come
along
sport
i
call
you
that
until
laro
the
native
said
in
a
deep
resonant
bass
voice
he
hit
himself
a
blow
on
the
head
that
would
have
floored
any
two
ordinary
men
sora
he
announced
striking
the
alien
woman
a
similar
blow
laro
and
sora
i
would
like
to
have
you
look
at
our
uranexite
with
the
idea
of
refueling
our
ship
come
with
me
please
both
nodded
and
followed
him
in
the
engine
room
he
pointed
at
the
engines
then
to
the
labyrinth
leading
to
the
fuel
holds
laro
do
you
understand
radioactive
laro
nodded
and
started
to
open
the
heavy
lead
door
hey
hilton
yelped
that
hot
he
seized
laro
arm
to
pull
him
away
and
got
the
shock
of
his
life
laro
weighed
at
least
five
hundred
pounds
and
the
guy
looked
human
laro
nodded
again
and
gave
himself
a
terrific
thump
on
the
chest
then
he
glanced
at
sora
who
stepped
away
from
sandra
he
then
went
into
the
hold
and
came
out
with
two
fuel
pellets
in
his
hand
one
of
which
he
tossed
to
sora
that
is
the
motion
looked
like
a
toss
but
the
pellet
traveled
like
a
bullet
sora
caught
it
unconcernedly
and
both
natives
flipped
the
pellets
into
their
mouths
there
was
a
half
minute
of
crunching
then
both
natives
opened
their
mouths
the
pellets
had
been
pulverized
and
swallowed
hilton
voice
rang
out
poynter
how
these
people
be
after
eating
a
whole
fuel
pellet
apiece
poynter
tested
both
natives
again
cold
he
reported
stone
cold
no
background
even
play
on
your
harmonica
laro
nodded
perfectly
and
in
hilton
mind
there
formed
a
picture
it
was
not
clear
but
it
showed
plainly
enough
a
long
line
of
aliens
approaching
the
each
carried
on
his
or
her
shoulder
a
lead
container
holding
two
hundred
pounds
of
navy
regulation
fuel
pellets
a
standard
was
sealed
into
place
and
every
was
filled
this
picture
laro
indicated
plainly
could
become
reality
any
time
sawtelle
was
notified
and
came
on
the
run
no
fuel
is
coming
aboard
without
being
tested
he
roared
of
course
not
but
it
pass
for
all
the
tea
in
china
you
had
a
ten
per
cent
load
of
fuel
since
you
were
launched
you
can
fill
up
or
not
the
fuel
here
just
as
you
say
if
they
can
make
navy
standard
of
course
we
want
it
the
fuel
arrived
every
load
tested
well
above
standard
every
fuel
hold
was
filled
to
capacity
with
no
leakage
and
no
emanation
the
natives
who
had
handled
the
stuff
did
not
go
away
but
gathered
in
the
and
more
and
more
humans
trickled
in
to
see
what
was
going
on
sawtelle
stiffened
what
going
on
over
there
hilton
i
do
know
but
let
let
go
for
a
minute
i
want
to
learn
about
these
people
and
they
got
me
stopped
cold
you
are
the
only
one
but
if
they
wreck
that
mayfield
it
cost
you
over
twenty
thousand
dollars
okay
the
captain
and
director
watched
wide
eyed
two
master
mechanics
had
been
getting
ready
to
a
tube
a
job
requiring
both
strength
and
skill
the
tube
was
very
heavy
and
made
of
superefract
the
machine
the
mayfield
upon
which
the
work
was
to
be
done
was
extremely
complex
two
of
the
aliens
had
brushed
the
mechanics
very
gently
aside
and
were
doing
their
work
for
them
ignoring
the
hoist
one
native
had
picked
the
tube
up
and
was
holding
it
exactly
in
place
on
the
mayfield
the
other
hands
moving
faster
than
the
eye
could
follow
was
locking
it
micrometrically
precise
and
immovably
secure
into
place
how
about
this
one
of
the
mechanics
asked
of
his
immediate
superior
if
we
throw
out
how
do
we
do
it
by
a
jerk
of
the
head
the
passed
the
buck
to
a
commissioned
officer
who
relayed
it
up
the
line
to
sawtelle
who
said
hilton
can
run
a
mayfield
without
months
of
training
they
wreck
it
and
it
cost
you
but
i
getting
curious
myself
enough
so
to
take
half
the
damage
let
go
ahead
how
this
mike
one
of
the
machinists
asked
of
his
fellow
i
going
to
this
what
my
deah
chumley
the
other
drawled
affectedly
my
man
relieves
me
of
much
uncouth
effort
the
natives
had
kept
on
working
the
mayfield
was
running
it
had
always
howled
and
screamed
at
its
work
but
now
it
gave
out
only
a
smooth
and
even
hum
the
aliens
had
adjusted
it
with
unhuman
precision
they
were
one
with
it
as
no
human
being
could
possibly
be
and
every
mind
present
knew
that
those
aliens
were
at
long
long
last
fulfilling
their
destiny
and
were
in
that
fulfillment
supremely
happy
after
tens
of
thousands
of
cycles
of
time
they
were
doing
a
job
for
their
adored
their
revered
and
beloved
masters
that
was
a
stunning
shock
but
it
was
eclipsed
by
another
i
am
sorry
master
hilton
laro
tremendous
bass
voice
boomed
out
that
it
has
taken
us
so
long
to
learn
your
masters
language
as
it
now
is
since
you
left
us
you
have
changed
it
radically
while
we
of
course
have
not
changed
it
at
all
i
sorry
but
you
mistaken
hilton
said
we
are
merely
visitors
we
have
never
been
here
before
nor
as
far
as
we
know
were
any
of
our
ancestors
ever
here
you
need
not
test
us
master
we
have
kept
your
trust
everything
has
been
kept
changelessly
the
same
awaiting
your
return
as
you
ordered
so
long
ago
can
you
read
my
mind
hilton
demanded
of
course
but
omans
can
not
read
in
masters
minds
anything
except
what
masters
want
omans
to
read
omans
harkins
asked
where
did
you
omans
and
your
masters
come
from
originally
as
you
know
master
the
masters
came
originally
from
arth
they
populated
ardu
where
we
omans
were
developed
when
the
stretts
drove
us
from
ardu
we
all
came
to
ardry
which
was
your
home
world
until
you
left
it
in
our
care
we
keep
also
this
your
half
of
the
fuel
world
in
trust
for
you
listen
jarve
harkins
said
tensely
two
three
you
ca
laugh
them
off
but
there
never
an
atlantis
this
is
getting
no
better
fast
we
need
a
full
staff
meeting
you
too
sawtelle
and
your
best
man
we
need
all
the
brains
the
can
muster
you
right
but
first
get
those
naked
women
out
of
here
it
bad
enough
having
women
aboard
at
all
but
this
my
men
are
mister
laro
spoke
up
if
it
is
the
masters
pleasure
to
keep
on
testing
us
so
be
it
we
have
forgotten
nothing
a
dwelling
awaits
each
master
in
which
each
will
be
served
by
omans
who
will
know
the
master
desires
without
being
told
every
desire
while
we
omans
have
no
biological
urges
we
are
of
course
highly
skilled
in
relieving
tensions
and
derive
as
much
pleasure
from
that
service
as
from
any
other
sawtelle
broke
the
silence
that
followed
well
for
the
men
he
hesitated
especially
on
the
ground
well
talking
in
mixed
company
you
know
but
i
think
think
nothing
of
the
mixed
company
captain
sawtelle
sandra
said
we
women
are
scientists
not
shrinking
violets
we
are
accustomed
to
discussing
the
facts
of
life
just
as
frankly
as
any
other
facts
sawtelle
jerked
a
thumb
at
hilton
who
followed
him
out
into
the
corridor
i
been
a
navy
mule
he
said
i
admit
now
that
and
i
just
as
baffled
at
present
as
you
are
sir
but
my
training
has
been
aimed
specifically
at
the
unexpected
while
yours
has
not
that
letting
me
down
easy
jarve
sawtelle
smiled
the
first
time
the
startled
hilton
had
known
that
the
hard
tough
old
spacehound
smile
what
i
wanted
to
say
is
lead
on
i
follow
you
through
and
thanks
skipper
and
by
the
way
i
erased
that
record
yesterday
the
two
gripped
hands
and
there
came
into
being
a
relationship
that
was
to
become
a
lifelong
friendship
we
will
start
for
ardry
immediately
hilton
said
how
do
we
make
that
jump
without
charts
laro
very
easily
master
kedo
as
master
captain
sawtelle
oman
will
give
the
orders
nito
will
serve
master
snowden
and
supply
the
knowledge
he
says
he
has
forgotten
okay
we
go
up
to
the
control
room
and
get
started
and
in
the
control
room
kedo
voice
rasped
into
the
microphone
attention
all
personnel
master
captain
sawtelle
orders
in
two
minutes
the
countdown
will
begin
at
five
seconds
five
four
three
two
one
lift
nito
not
snowden
handled
the
controls
as
perfectly
as
the
human
pilot
had
ever
done
it
at
the
top
of
his
finest
form
he
picked
the
immense
spaceship
up
and
slipped
it
silkily
into
subspace
well
i
be
a
snowden
gasped
that
a
better
job
than
i
did
not
at
all
master
as
you
know
nito
said
it
was
you
who
did
this
i
merely
performed
the
labor
a
few
minutes
later
in
the
main
lounge
navy
and
busci
personnel
were
mingling
as
they
had
never
done
before
whatever
had
caused
this
relaxation
of
tension
the
friendship
of
captain
and
director
the
position
in
which
they
all
were
or
what
they
all
began
to
get
acquainted
with
each
other
silence
please
and
be
seated
hilton
said
while
this
is
not
exactly
a
formal
meeting
it
will
be
recorded
for
future
reference
first
i
will
ask
laro
a
question
were
books
or
records
left
on
ardry
by
the
race
you
call
the
masters
you
know
there
are
master
they
are
exactly
as
you
left
them
undisturbed
for
over
two
hundred
thousand
years
therefore
we
will
not
question
the
omans
we
do
not
know
what
questions
to
ask
we
have
seen
many
things
hitherto
thought
impossible
hence
we
must
discard
all
preconceived
opinions
which
conflict
with
facts
i
will
mention
a
few
of
the
problems
we
face
the
omans
the
masters
the
upgrading
of
the
armament
of
the
to
oman
standards
the
concentration
of
uranexite
what
is
that
concentrate
how
is
it
used
total
conversion
how
is
it
accomplished
the
skeletons
what
are
they
and
how
are
they
controlled
their
ability
to
drain
power
who
or
what
is
back
of
them
why
a
deadlock
that
has
lasted
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
how
much
danger
are
we
and
the
actually
in
how
much
danger
is
terra
in
because
of
our
presence
here
there
are
many
other
questions
sandra
and
i
will
not
take
part
nor
will
three
others
de
vaux
eisenstein
and
blake
you
have
more
important
work
to
do
what
can
that
be
asked
rebecca
of
what
possible
use
can
a
mathematician
a
theoretician
and
a
theoretical
astronomer
be
in
such
a
situation
as
this
you
can
think
powerfully
in
abstract
terms
unhampered
by
terran
facts
and
laws
which
we
now
know
are
neither
facts
nor
laws
i
can
not
even
categorize
the
problems
we
face
perhaps
you
three
will
be
able
to
you
will
listen
then
consult
then
tell
me
how
to
pick
the
teams
to
do
the
work
a
more
important
job
for
you
is
this
any
problem
to
be
solved
must
be
stated
clearly
and
we
do
know
even
what
our
basic
problem
is
i
want
something
by
the
use
of
which
i
can
break
this
thing
open
get
it
for
me
rebecca
and
de
vaux
merely
smiled
and
nodded
but
teddy
blake
said
happily
i
was
beginning
to
feel
like
a
fifth
wheel
on
this
project
but
something
i
can
really
stick
my
teeth
into
huh
how
karns
demanded
he
did
give
you
one
single
thing
to
go
on
just
compounded
the
confusion
hilton
spoke
before
teddy
could
that
their
dish
bill
if
i
had
any
data
i
work
it
myself
you
first
captain
sawtelle
that
conference
was
a
very
long
one
indeed
there
were
almost
as
many
conclusions
and
recommendations
as
there
were
speakers
and
through
it
all
hilton
and
sandra
listened
they
weighed
and
tested
and
analyzed
and
made
copious
notes
in
shorthand
and
in
the
more
esoteric
characters
of
symbolic
logic
and
at
its
end
i
just
about
pooped
sandy
how
about
you
you
and
me
both
boss
see
you
in
the
morning
but
she
did
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
when
they
met
again
we
made
up
one
of
the
teams
sandy
he
said
with
surprising
diffidence
i
know
we
were
going
to
do
it
together
but
i
got
a
hunch
on
the
first
team
a
kind
of
a
weirdie
but
the
brains
checked
me
on
it
he
placed
a
card
on
her
desk
do
blow
your
top
until
after
i
you
studied
it
why
i
wo
of
course
her
voice
died
away
maybe
you
better
cancel
that
course
she
studied
and
when
she
spoke
again
she
was
exerting
a
chemist
a
planetographer
a
theoretician
sociologists
a
psychologist
and
a
radiationist
and
six
of
the
seven
are
three
pairs
of
sweeties
what
kind
of
a
is
to
solve
a
problem
in
it
is
in
any
physics
we
know
i
said
oh
she
said
then
again
oh
and
oh
and
oh
four
entirely
different
tones
i
see
maybe
you
matching
minds
not
specialties
and
supplementing
i
knew
you
were
smart
buy
it
it
weird
all
right
but
i
buy
it
for
a
trial
run
anyway
but
i
hate
like
sin
to
have
to
sell
any
part
of
it
to
the
board
but
of
course
we
i
mean
you
responsible
only
to
yourself
keep
it
sandy
you
as
important
to
this
project
as
i
am
but
before
we
tackle
the
second
team
what
your
thought
on
bernadine
and
hermione
separate
or
together
separate
i
say
they
identical
physically
and
so
nearly
so
mentally
that
of
them
would
be
just
as
good
on
a
team
as
both
of
them
more
and
better
work
on
different
teams
my
thought
exactly
and
so
it
went
hour
after
hour
the
teams
were
selected
and
meetings
were
held
the
reached
ardry
which
was
very
much
like
terra
there
were
continents
oceans
lakes
rivers
mountains
and
plains
forests
and
prairies
the
ship
landed
on
the
spacefield
of
omlu
the
city
of
the
masters
and
sawtelle
called
hilton
into
his
cabin
the
omans
laro
and
kedo
went
along
of
course
nobody
knows
how
it
leaked
sawtelle
began
no
secrets
around
here
hilton
grinned
omans
you
know
i
suppose
so
anyway
every
man
aboard
is
all
hyped
up
about
living
aground
especially
with
a
harem
but
before
i
grant
liberty
suppose
there
any
vd
around
here
that
our
prophylactics
ca
handle
as
you
know
masters
laro
replied
for
hilton
before
the
latter
could

necessary

hold
you
for
a
while
skipper
hilton
smiled
at
the
flabbergasted
captain
and
went
back
to
the
lounge
everybody
going
ashore
he
asked
yes
karns
said
unanimous
vote
for
the
first
time
who
would
sandra
asked
i
fed
up
with
living
like
a
sardine
i
will
scream
for
joy
the
minute
i
get
into
a
real
room
cars
were
waiting
in
a
line
jobs
all
were
empty
no
drivers
no
no
instruments
or
when
the
whole
line
moved
ahead
as
one
vehicle
there
was
no
noise
no
gas
no
blast
an
oman
helped
a
master
carefully
into
the
rear
seat
of
his
car
leaped
into
the
front
seat
and
the
car
sped
quietly
away
the
whole
line
of
empty
cars
acting
in
perfect
synchronization
shot
forward
one
space
and
stopped
this
is
your
car
master
laro
said
and
made
a
production
out
of
getting
hilton
into
the
vehicle
undamaged
hilton
plan
had
been
beautifully
simple
all
the
teams
were
to
meet
at
the
hall
of
records
the
linguists
and
their
omans
would
study
the
records
and
pass
them
out
specialty
after
specialty
would
be
unveiled
and
teams
would
work
on
them
he
and
sandy
would
sit
in
the
office
and
analyze
and
synthesize
and
correlate
it
was
a
very
nice
plan
it
was
a
very
nice
office
too
it
contained
every
item
of
equipment
that
either
sandra
or
hilton
had
ever
worked
with
it
was
a
big
office
and
a
great
many
that
neither
of
them
had
ever
heard
of
it
had
a
full
staff
of
omans
all
eager
to
work
hilton
and
sandra
sat
in
that
magnificent
office
for
three
hours
and
no
reports
came
in
nothing
happened
at
all
this
gives
me
the
howling
howpers
hilton
growled
why
have
i
got
brains
enough
to
be
on
one
of
those
teams
i
could
shed
a
tear
for
you
you
big
dope
but
i
wo
sandra
retorted
what
do
you
want
to
be
besides
the
brain
and
the
kingpin
and
the
and
the
of
the
outfit
do
you
want
to
do
yourself
well
i
want
to
go
completely
nuts
and
that
all
i
doing
at
the
moment
the
argument
might
have
become
acrimonious
but
it
was
interrupted
by
a
call
from
karns
can
you
come
out
here
jarve
we
struck
a
knot
trouble
with
the
omans
hilton
snapped
not
exactly
just
squared
we
ca
even
get
started
i
like
to
have
you
two
come
out
here
and
see
if
you
can
do
anything
i
not
trying
rough
stuff
because
i
know
it
would
work
coming
up
bill
and
hilton
and
sandra
followed
by
laro
and
sora
dashed
out
to
their
cars
the
hall
of
records
was
a
long
wide
low
windowless
very
massive
structure
built
of
a
metal
that
looked
like
stainless
steel
kept
highly
polished
the
vast
expanse
of
seamless
and
jointless
metal
was
the
one
great
door
was
open
and
just
inside
it
were
the
scientists
and
their
omans
brief
me
bill
hilton
said
no
lights
they
wo
turn
on
and
we
ca
ca
find
either
lights
or
any
possible
kind
of
switches
turn
on
the
lights
laro
hilton
said
you
know
that
i
can
not
do
that
master
it
is
forbidden
for
any
oman
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
illumination
of
this
solemn
and
revered
place
then
show
me
how
to
do
it
that
would
be
just
as
bad
master
the
oman
said
proudly
i
will
not
fail
any
test
you
can
devise
okay
all
you
omans
go
back
to
the
ship
and
bring
over
fifteen
or
twenty
lights
the
tripod
jobs
scat
they
scatted
and
hilton
went
on
no
use
asking
questions
if
you
know
what
questions
to
ask
let
see
if
we
can
cook
up
something
lane
kathy
what
has
biology
got
to
say
lane
saunders
and
kathryn
cook
the
latter
a
willowy
blonde
conferred
briefly
then
saunders
spoke
running
both
hands
through
his
unruly
shock
of
fiery
red
hair
so
far
the
best
we
can
do
is
a
educated
guess
they
androids
their
is
composed
mainly
of
silicon
and
fluorine
we
do
know
the
formula
yet
but
it
is
as
much
more
stable
than
our
teflon
as
teflon
is
than
mush
as
to
the
brains
no
data
bones
are
steel
teeth
harder
than
diamond
but
wo
break
food
uranexite
or
its
concentrated
derivative
interchangeably
storage
reserve
indefinite
laro
and
sora
wo
to
eat
again
for
at
least
years
the
group
gasped
as
one
but
saunders
went
on
they
can
eat
and
drink
and
breathe
and
so
on
but
only
because
the
original
masters
wanted
them
to
skins
and
subcutaneous
layers
are
soft
for
the
same
reason
that
about
it
up
to
now
thanks
lane
hark
is
it
reasonable
to
believe
that
any
culture
whatever
could
run
for
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
without
changing
one
word
of
its
language
or
one
iota
of
its
behavior
reasonable
or
not
it
seems
to
have
happened
now
for
psychology
alex
it
seems
starkly
incredible
but
it
seems
to
be
true
if
it
is
their
minds
were
subjected
to
a
conditioning
no
terran
has
ever
imagined
an
unyielding
fixation
they
ca
be
swayed
then
by
reason
or
logic
hilton
paused
invitingly
or
anything
else
kincaid
said
flatly
if
we
right
they
ca
be
swayed
period
i
was
afraid
of
that
well
that
all
the
questions
i
know
how
to
ask
any
contributions
to
this
symposium
after
a
short
silence
de
vaux
said
i
suppose
you
realize
that
the
first
half
of
the
problem
you
posed
us
has
now
solved
itself
why
no
no
you
ahead
of
me
there
is
a
basic
problem
and
it
can
now
be
clearly
stated
rebecca
said
problem
to
determine
a
method
of
securing
full
cooperation
from
the
omans
the
first
step
in
the
solution
of
this
problem
is
to
find
the
most
appropriate
operator
teddy
i
have
an
operator
of
sorts
theodora
said
i
been
hoping
one
of
us
could
find
a
better
what
is
it
hilton
demanded
the
word
teddy
you
a
hilton
exclaimed
how
can
be
a
mathematical
operator
sandra
asked
easily
hilton
was
already
deep
in
thought
this
hard
conditioning
was
to
last
only
the
masters
returned
then
they
break
it
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
figure
out
how
a
master
would
do
it
that
kincaid
said
meaningly
hilton
pondered
then
listen
all
of
you
i
may
have
to
try
a
colossal
job
of
bluffing
just
what
would
you
call
after
what
you
did
to
the
navy
karns
asked
that
was
a
sure
thing
this
is
you
see
to
find
out
whether
laro
is
really
an
immovable
object
i
got
to
make
like
an
irresistible
force
which
i
ai
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
i
have
to
roll
it
as
i
go
along
so
all
of
you
keep
on
your
toes
and
back
any
play
i
make
here
they
come
the
omans
came
in
and
hilton
faced
laro
eyes
to
eyes
laro
he
said
you
refused
to
obey
my
direct
order
your
reasoning
seems
to
be
that
whether
the
masters
wish
it
or
not
you
omans
will
block
any
changes
whatever
in
the
throughout
all
time
to
come
in
other
words
you
deny
the
fact
that
masters
are
in
fact
your
masters
but
that
is
not
exactly
it
master
the
masters
that
is
it
it
either
you
are
the
master
here
or
you
are
not
that
is
a
point
to
which
your
logic
can
be
strictly
applied
you
are
wilfully
neglecting
the
word
this
stasis
was
to
exist
only
the
masters
returned
are
we
masters
have
we
returned
note
well
upon
that
one
word
may
depend
the
length
of
time
your
oman
race
will
continue
to
exist
the
omans
flinched
the
humans
gasped
but
more
of
that
later
hilton
went
on
unmoved
your
ancient
masters
being
like
us
changed
materially
with
time
did
they
not
and
you
changed
with
them
but
we
did
not
change
ourselves
master
the
masters
you
did
change
yourselves
the
masters
changed
only
the
prototype
brain
they
ordered
you
to
change
yourselves
and
you
obeyed
their
orders
we
order
you
to
change
and
you
refuse
to
obey
our
orders
we
have
changed
greatly
from
our
ancestors
right
that
is
right
master
we
are
stronger
physically
more
alert
and
more
vigorous
mentally
with
a
keener
sharper
outlook
on
life
you
are
master
that
is
because
our
ancestors
decided
to
do
without
omans
we
do
our
own
work
and
enjoy
it
your
masters
died
of
futility
and
boredom
what
i
would
like
to
do
laro
is
take
you
to
the
creche
and
put
your
disobedient
brain
back
into
the
matrix
however
the
decision
is
not
mine
alone
to
make
how
about
it
fellows
and
girls
would
you
rather
have
alleged
servants
who
wo
do
anything
you
tell
them
to
or
no
servants
at
all
as
semantician
i
protest
sandra
backed
his
play
that
is
the
most
viciously
loaded
question
i
ever
heard
it
ca
be
answered
except
in
the
wrong
way
okay
i
make
it
semantically
sound
i
think
we
better
scrap
this
whole
oman
race
and
start
over
and
want
a
vote
that
you
wo
get
it
and
everybody
began
to
yell
hilton
restored
order
and
swung
on
laro
his
attitude
stiff
hostile
and
reserved
since
it
is
clear
that
no
unanimous
decision
is
to
be
expected
at
this
time
i
will
take
no
action
at
this
time
think
over
very
carefully
what
i
have
said
for
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
world
has
no
place
for
omans
who
will
not
obey
orders
as
soon
as
i
convince
my
staff
of
the
fact
i
shall
act
as
follows
i
shall
give
you
an
order
and
if
you
do
not
obey
it
blast
your
head
to
a
cinder
i
shall
then
give
the
same
order
to
another
oman
and
blast
him
this
process
will
continue
first
i
find
an
obedient
oman
second
i
run
out
of
blasters
third
the
planet
runs
out
of
omans
now
take
these
lights
into
the
first
room
of
records
that
one
over
there
he
pointed
and
no
oman
and
only
four
humans
realized
that
he
had
made
the
omans
telegraph
their
destination
so
that
he
could
point
it
out
to
them
inside
the
room
hilton
asked
caustically
of
laro
the
masters
lift
those
heavy
chests
down
themselves
did
they
oh
no
master
we
did
that
do
it
then
number
one
first
yes
that
one
open
it
and
start
playing
the
records
in
order
the
records
were
not
tapes
or
flats
or
reels
but
were
spools
of
wire
the
players
were
projectors
of
sound
pictures
hilton
canceled
all
moves
aground
and
issued
orders
that
no
oman
was
to
be
allowed
aboard
ship
then
looked
and
listened
with
his
staff
the
first
chest
contained
only
introductory
and
elementary
stuff
but
it
was
so
interesting
that
the
humans
stayed
overtime
to
finish
it
then
they
went
back
to
the
ship
and
in
the
main
lounge
hilton
practically
collapsed
onto
a
davenport
he
took
out
a
cigarette
and
stared
in
surprise
at
his
hand
which
was
shaking
i
i
could
use
a
drink
he
remarked
what
before
supper
karns
marveled
then
hey
wally
rush
a
flagon
of
avignognac
arnaud
freres
for
the
boss
and
everything
else
for
the
rest
of
us
but
quick
a
hectic
followed
then
okay
boys
and
girls
i
love
you
too
but
let
cut
out
the
slurp
and
sloosh
get
some
supper
and
log
us
some
sack
time
i
just
about
pooped
sorry
i
had
to
queer
the
deal
sandy
you
poor
little
sardine
but
you
know
how
it
is
sandra
grimaced
i
can
take
it
a
while
longer
if
you
can
after
breakfast
next
morning
the
staff
met
in
the
lounge
as
usual
hilton
and
sandra
were
the
first
to
arrive
hi
boss
she
greeted
him
how
do
you
feel
fine
i
could
whip
a
wildcat
and
give
her
the
first
two
scratches
i
a
bit
beat
up
last
night
though
i
say
but
what
i
simply
ca
get
over
is
the
way
you
underplayed
the
climax
the
planet
runs
out
of
omans
just
like
that
no
emphasis
at
all
wow
it
had
the
impact
of
a
atomic
bomb
it
put
all
over
me
but
just
missed
it
no
fear
they
smart
i
had
to
play
it
as
though
the
whole
oman
race
is
no
more
important
than
a
cigarette
butt
the
great
big
question
though
is
whether
i
put
it
across
or
not
at
that
point
a
dozen
people
came
in
all
talking
about
the
same
subject
hi
jarve
karns
said
i
say
you
ought
to
take
up
poker
as
a
life
work
tiny
let
you
and
him
sit
down
now
and
play
a
few
hands
non
de
vaux
shook
his
head
violently
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
threw
both
arms
wide
by
the
sacred
name
of
a
small
blue
cabbage
not
me
karns
laughed
how
did
you
have
the
guts
to
state
so
many
things
as
facts
if
you
guessed
wrong
just
once
i
did
hilton
grinned
think
back
bill
the
only
thing
i
said
as
a
fact
was
that
we
as
a
race
are
better
than
the
masters
were
and
that
is
obvious
everything
else
was
implication
logic
and
bluff
that
right
at
that
and
they
neurotic
and
decadent
no
question
about
that
but
listen
boss
this
was
stella
wing
about
this
business
if
laro
could
read
your
mind
he
know
you
were
bluffing
and
oh
that
can
read
only
what
masters
wish
omans
to
read
eh
but
think
that
applies
to
us
i
sure
it
does
and
i
was
thinking
some
pretty
savage
thoughts
and
i
want
to
caution
all
of
you
whenever
you
near
any
oman
start
thinking
that
you
beginning
to
agree
with
me
that
they
useless
to
us
and
let
them
know
it
now
get
out
on
the
job
all
of
you
scat
just
a
minute
poynter
said
we
going
to
have
to
keep
on
using
the
omans
and
their
cars
are
we
of
course
just
be
superior
and
distant
they
on
probation
we
have
decided
yet
what
to
do
about
them
since
that
happens
to
be
true
it
be
easy
hilton
and
sandra
went
to
their
tiny
office
there
was
room
to
pace
the
floor
but
hilton
tried
to
pace
it
anyway
now
do
say
again
that
you
want
to
something
sandra
said
brightly
look
what
happened
when
you
said
that
yesterday
i
got
a
job
but
i
do
know
enough
to
do
it
the
creche
probably
only
one
on
the
planet
so
i
want
you
to
help
me
think
the
masters
were
very
sensitive
to
radiation
right
right
that
city
on
fuel
bin
was
kept
deconned
to
zero
just
in
case
some
master
wanted
to
visit
it
and
the
masters
had
to
work
in
the
creche
whenever
anything
really
new
had
to
be
put
into
the
prototype
brain
i
say
so
yes
so
they
had
armor
probably
as
much
better
than
our
radiation
suits
as
the
rest
of
their
stuff
is
now
did
they
or
did
they
not
have
thought
screens
ouch
you
think
of
the
things
chief
she
caught
her
lower
lip
between
her
teeth
and
concentrated
i
do
know
there
are
at
least
fifty
vectors
all
pointing
in
different
directions
i
know
it
the
key
one
in
my
opinion
is
that
the
masters
gave
telepathy
and
speech
i
considered
that
and
weighted
it
even
so
the
probability
is
only
about
point
can
you
take
that
much
of
a
chance
yes
i
can
make
one
or
two
mistakes
next
about
finding
that
creche
any
spot
of
radiation
on
the
planet
would
be
it
but
the
search
might
take
hold
on
they
have
it
heavily
shielded
there
be
no
leakage
at
all
laro
will
have
to
take
you
that
right
want
to
come
along
nothing
much
will
happen
here
today
not
sandra
shivered
in
distaste
i
want
to
see
brains
and
livers
and
things
swimming
around
in
nutrient
solution
if
i
can
help
it
okay
it
all
yours
i
be
back
sometime
and
hilton
went
out
onto
the
dock
where
the
dejected
laro
was
waiting
for
him
hi
laro
get
the
car
and
take
me
to
the
hall
of
records
the
android
brightened
up
immediately
and
hurried
to
obey
at
the
hall
hilton
first
care
was
to
see
how
the
work
was
going
on
eight
of
the
huge
rooms
were
now
open
and
brightly
lighted
operating
the
lamps
had
been
one
of
the
first
items
on
the
first
spool
of
instructions
with
a
cold
sourceless
light
every
team
had
found
its
objective
and
was
working
on
it
some
of
them
were
doing
nicely
but
the
first
team
could
not
even
get
started
its
primary
record
would
advance
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
stop
while
omans
and
humans
sought
out
other
records
and
other
projectors
in
an
attempt
to
elucidate
some
concept
that
simply
could
not
be
translated
into
any
words
or
symbols
known
to
terran
science
at
the
moment
there
were
seventeen
of
those
peculiar
projectors
viewers
playbacks
in
use
and
all
of
them
were
stopped
you
know
what
we
got
to
jarve
karns
the
team
captain
exploded
go
back
to
being
college
freshmen
or
maybe
grade
school
or
kindergarten
we
do
know
yet
and
learn
a
whole
new
system
of
mathematics
before
we
can
even
begin
to
this
stuff
and
you
bellyaching
about
that
hilton
marveled
i
wish
i
could
join
you
that
be
fun
then
as
karns
started
a
snappy
rejoinder
but
i
got
troubles
of
my
own
he
added
hastily
now
and
beat
a
rejoinder
out
in
the
hall
again
hilton
took
his
chance
after
all
the
odds
were
about
two
to
one
that
he
would
win
i
want
a
couple
of
things
laro
first
a
thought
screen
he
won
very
well
master
they
are
in
a
distant
room
department
four
six
nine
will
you
wait
here
on
this
cushioned
bench
master
no
we
do
like
to
rest
too
much
i
go
with
you
then
walking
along
he
went
on
thoughtfully
i
been
thinking
since
last
night
laro
there
are
tremendous
advantages
in
having
omans
i
am
very
glad
you
think
so
master
i
want
to
serve
you
it
is
my
greatest
need
if
they
could
be
kept
from
smothering
us
to
death
thus
if
our
ancestors
had
kept
their
omans
i
would
have
known
all
about
life
on
this
world
and
about
this
hall
of
records
instead
of
having
the
fragmentary
confusing
and
sometimes
false
information
i
now
have
oh
we
here
laro
had
stopped
and
was
opening
a
door
he
stood
aside
hilton
went
in
touched
with
one
finger
a
crystalline
cube
set
conveniently
into
a
wall
gave
a
mental
command
and
the
lights
went
on
laro
opened
a
cabinet
and
took
out
a
disk
about
the
size
of
a
dime
pendant
from
a
while
hilton
had
not
known
what
to
expect
he
certainly
had
not
expected
anything
as
simple
as
that
nevertheless
he
kept
his
face
straight
and
his
thoughts
unmoved
as
laro
hung
the
tiny
thing
around
his
neck
and
adjusted
the
chain
to
a
loose
fit
thanks
laro
hilton
removed
it
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
it
work
from
there
will
it
no
master
to
function
it
must
be
within
eighteen
inches
of
the
brain
the
second
thing
master
a
suit
then
you
will
please
take
me
to
the
creche
the
android
almost
missed
a
step
but
said
nothing
the
suit
how
glad
hilton
was
that
he
had
not
called
it
armor
was
as
much
of
a
surprise
as
the
generator
had
been
it
was
a
coverall
made
of
something
that
looked
like
thin
plastic
weighing
less
than
one
pound
it
had
one
sealed
box
about
the
size
and
weight
of
a
cigarette
case
no
wires
or
apparatus
could
be
seen
air
entered
through
two
filters
one
at
each
heel
flowed
upward
for
no
reason
at
all
that
hilton
could
see
and
out
through
a
filter
above
the
top
of
his
head
the
suit
neither
flopped
nor
clung
but
stood
out
comfortably
out
of
the
way
all
by
itself
hilton
just
barely
accepted
the
suit
too
without
showing
surprise
the
creche
it
turned
out
while
not
in
the
city
of
omlu
itself
was
not
too
far
out
to
reach
easily
by
car
en
route
laro
said
stiffly
tentatively
hilton
could
not
fit
an
adverb
to
the
tone
master
have
you
then
decided
to
destroy
me
that
is
of
course
your
right
not
this
time
at
least
laro
drew
an
entirely
human
breath
of
relief
and
hilton
went
on
i
do
want
to
destroy
you
at
all
and
wo
unless
i
have
to
but
some
way
or
other
my
friend
you
are
either
going
to
learn
how
to
cooperate
or
you
wo
last
much
longer
but
master
that
is
exactly
oh
do
we
to
go
over
that
again
at
the
blaze
of
frustrated
fury
in
hilton
mind
laro
flinched
away
if
you
ca
talk
sense
keep
still
in
half
an
hour
the
car
stopped
in
front
of
a
small
building
which
looked
something
like
a
subway
kiosk
except
for
the
door
which
built
of
lead
swung
on
a
piano
hinge
having
a
pin
a
good
eight
inches
in
diameter
laro
opened
that
door
they
went
in
as
the
tremendously
massive
portal
clanged
shut
lights
flashed
on
hilton
glanced
at
his
one
inside
one
outside
his
suit
both
showed
zero
down
twenty
steps
another
door
twenty
more
another
and
a
fourth
hilton
inside
meter
still
read
zero
the
outside
one
was
beginning
to
climb
into
an
elevator
and
straight
down
for
what
must
have
been
four
or
five
hundred
feet
another
door
hilton
went
through
this
final
barrier
gingerly
eyes
nailed
to
his
gauges
the
outside
needle
was
high
in
the
red
almost
against
the
pin
but
the
inside
one
still
sat
reassuringly
on
zero
he
stared
at
the
android
how
can
any
possible
brain
take
so
much
of
stuff
without
damage
it
does
not
reach
the
brain
master
we
convert
it
each
minute
of
this
is
what
you
would
call
a
square
meal
i
see
dimly
you
can
eat
energy
or
drink
it
or
soak
it
up
through
your
skins
however
it
comes
it
all
duck
soup
for
you
yes
master
hilton
glanced
ahead
toward
the
far
end
of
the
immensely
long
comparatively
narrow
room
it
was
purely
and
simply
an
assembly
line
and
fully
automated
in
operation
you
are
replacing
the
omans
destroyed
in
the
battle
with
the
skeletons
yes
master
hilton
covered
the
first
half
of
the
line
at
a
fast
walk
he
was
not
particularly
interested
in
the
fabrication
of
skeletons
nor
in
the
installation
and
connection
of
atomic
engines
converters
and
so
on
he
was
more
interested
in
the
synthetic
flesh
and
paused
long
enough
to
get
a
general
idea
of
its
growth
and
application
he
was
very
much
interested
in
how
such
skin
could
act
as
both
absorber
and
converter
but
he
could
see
nothing
helpful
an
application
i
suppose
of
the
same
principle
used
in
this
radiation
suit
yes
master
at
the
end
of
the
line
he
stopped
a
brain
in
place
and
connected
to
millions
of
infinitely
fine
wire
nerves
but
not
yet
surrounded
by
a
skull
was
being
educated
scanners
multitudes
of
incomprehensibly
complex
machines
most
of
them
were
doing
nothing
apparently
but
such
beams
would
have
to
be
invisibly
microscopically
fine
but
a
bare
brain
in
such
a
hot
environment
as
this
he
looked
down
at
his
gauges
both
read
zero
fields
of
force
master
laro
said
but
damn
it
this
suit
itself
would
the
suit
is
master
hilton
was
appalled
with
such
stuff
as
that
and
the
plastic
shield
besides
why
all
the
depth
and
all
that
solid
lead
the
masters
orders
master
machines
can
and
occasionally
do
fail
so
might
conceivably
the
plastic
and
that
structure
over
there
contains
the
original
brain
from
which
all
the
copies
are
made
yes
master
we
call
it
the
and
you
ca
touch
the
guide
not
even
if
it
means
total
destruction
none
of
you
can
touch
it
that
is
the
case
master
okay
back
to
the
car
and
back
to
the
at
the
car
hilton
took
off
the
suit
and
hung
the
generator
around
his
neck
and
in
the
car
for
twenty
five
solid
minutes
he
sat
still
and
thought
his
bluff
had
worked
up
to
a
point
a
good
far
point
but
not
quite
far
enough
laro
had
stopped
that
as
you
already
know
stuff
he
was
eager
to
go
as
far
in
cooperation
as
he
possibly
could
but
he
go
far
enough
but
there
to
be
a
way
hilton
considered
way
after
way
way
after
unworkable
useless
way
until
finally
he
worked
out
one
that
might
just
possibly
might
work
laro
i
know
that
you
derive
pleasure
and
satisfaction
from
serving
me
in
doing
what
i
ought
to
be
doing
myself
but
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
that
a
hell
of
a
way
to
treat
a
highly
capable
brain
to
waste
it
on
copycat
stuff
why
no
master
it
never
did
besides
anything
else
would
be
forbidden
or
would
it
stop
somewhere
park
this
heap
we
too
close
to
the
ship
and
besides
i
want
your
full
undivided
concentrated
attention
no
i
do
think
originality
was
expressly
forbidden
it
would
have
been
of
course
if
the
masters
had
thought
of
it
but
neither
they
nor
you
ever
even
considered
the
possibility
of
such
a
thing
right
it
may
be
yes
master
you
are
right
okay
hilton
took
off
his
necklace
the
better
to
drive
home
the
intensity
and
sincerity
of
his
thought
now
suppose
that
you
are
not
my
slave
and
simple
automatic
relay
station
instead
we
are
working
together
upon
problems
too
difficult
for
either
of
us
to
solve
alone
our
minds
while
independent
are
linked
or
in
mesh
each
is
helping
and
instructing
the
other
both
are
working
at
full
power
and
under
free
rein
at
the
exploration
of
vistas
of
thought
vistas
and
expanses
which
neither
of
us
has
ever
previously
stop
master
laro
covered
both
ears
with
his
hands
and
pulled
his
mind
away
from
hilton
you
are
overloading
me
that
quite
a
load
to
assimilate
all
at
once
hilton
agreed
to
help
you
get
used
to
it
stop
calling
me
that
an
order
you
may
call
me
jarve
or
jarvis
or
hilton
or
whatever
but
no
more
master
very
well
sir
hilton
laughed
and
slapped
himself
on
the
knee
okay
i
let
you
get
away
with
that
at
least
for
a
while
and
to
get
away
from
that
slavish
ending
on
your
name
i
call
you
you
like
i
would
like
that
immensely
sir
keep
trying
larry
you
make
it
yet
hilton
leaned
forward
and
walloped
the
android
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
knee
home
james
the
car
shot
forward
and
hilton
went
on
i
do
expect
even
your
brain
to
get
the
full
value
of
this
in
any
short
space
of
time
so
let
it
stew
in
its
own
juice
for
a
week
or
two
the
car
swept
out
onto
the
dock
and
stopped
so
long
larry
but
ca
i
come
in
with
you
sir
no
you
are
a
copycat
or
a
semaphore
or
a
relay
any
longer
you
a
independent
entity
monarch
of
all
you
survey
captain
of
your
soul
and
so
on
i
want
you
to
devote
the
imponderable
force
of
the
intellect
to
that
concept
until
you
understand
it
thoroughly
until
you
have
developed
a
lot
of
stuff
originality
initiative
force
drive
and
thrust
as
soon
as
you
really
understand
it
you
do
something
about
it
yourself
without
being
told
go
to
it
chum
in
the
ship
hilton
went
directly
to
kincaid
office
alex
i
want
to
ask
you
a
thing
that
got
a
snapper
on
it
then
slowly
and
hesitantly
it
about
temple
bells
has
she
is
she
well
does
she
remind
you
in
any
way
of
an
iceberg
then
as
the
psychologist
began
to
smile
and
no
damn
it
i
mean
physically
i
know
you
do
kincaid
smile
was
rueful
not
at
all
what
hilton
had
thought
it
was
going
to
be
she
does
would
it
be
helpful
to
know
that
i
first
asked
then
ordered
her
to
trade
places
with
me
it
would
very
i
know
why
she
refused
you
a
good
man
alex
thanks
jarve
to
answer
the
question
you
were
going
to
ask
next
no
i
will
not
be
at
all
perturbed
or
put
out
if
you
put
her
onto
a
job
that
some
people
might
think
should
have
been
mine
what
the
job
and
when
that
the
devil
of
it
i
do
know
hilton
brought
kincaid
up
to
date
so
you
see
it
have
to
develop
and
god
only
knows
what
line
it
will
take
my
thought
is
that
temple
and
i
should
form
a
committee
of
two
to
watch
it
develop
that
one
i
buy
and
i
look
on
with
glee
thanks
fellow
hilton
went
down
to
his
office
stuck
his
big
feet
up
onto
his
desk
settled
back
onto
his
spine
and
buried
himself
in
thought
hours
later
he
got
up
shrugged
and
went
to
bed
without
bothering
to
eat
days
passed
and
weeks
iv
look
said
stella
wing
to
beverly
bell
over
there
i
seen
it
before
it
simply
disgusting
a
laugh
stella
eyes
twinkled
you
made
your
bombing
runs
on
that
target
too
my
sweet
and
did
score
any
higher
than
i
did
i
soon
found
out
i
did
want
him
much
too
stiff
and
serious
a
lot
more
fun
the
staff
had
gathered
in
the
lounge
as
had
become
the
custom
to
spend
an
hour
or
so
before
bedtime
in
reading
conversation
dancing
light
flirtation
and
even
lighter
drinking
most
of
the
girls
and
many
of
the
men
drank
only
soft
drinks
hilton
took
one
drink
per
day
of
avignognac
a
fine
old
brandy
so
did
de
vaux
the
two
usually
making
a
ceremony
of
it
across
the
room
from
stella
and
beverly
temple
bells
was
looking
up
at
hilton
and
laughing
she
took
his
elbow
and
in
the
gesture
now
familiar
to
all
pressed
his
arm
quickly
but
in
no
sense
furtively
against
her
side
and
he
equally
openly
held
her
forearm
for
a
moment
in
the
full
grasp
of
his
hand
and
he
a
pawer
stella
said
thoughtfully
he
never
touches
any
of
the
rest
of
us
she
him
to
do
that
damn
her
without
him
ever
knowing
anything
about
it
and
i
wish
i
knew
how
she
did
it
that
is
pawing
beverly
laughed
lightly
it
simply
if
he
did
fend
her
off
god
knows
what
she
do
i
still
say
disgusting
and
the
way
she
dances
with
him
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
he
ought
to
fire
her
she
never
been
caught
outside
the
safety
zone
and
we
all
been
watching
her
like
hawks
in
fact
she
the
only
one
of
us
all
who
has
never
been
alone
with
him
for
a
minute
no
darling
she
is
playing
games
she
playing
for
keeps
and
she
a
mighty
smooth
worker
huh
beverly
emitted
a
snort
what
so
smooth
about
showing
off
that
way
any
of
us
could
do
that
if
we
would
miaouw
miaouw
who
do
you
think
you
kidding
bev
you
sanctimonious
hypocrite
she
has
staked
out
the
biggest
claim
she
could
find
she
posted
notices
all
over
it
and
is
guarding
it
with
a
pistol
half
your
month
salary
gets
you
all
of
mine
if
she
does
walk
him
up
the
center
aisle
as
soon
as
we
get
back
to
earth
we
can
both
learn
a
lot
from
that
girl
darling
and
i
for
one
am
going
to
she
has
got
a
thing
want
beverly
laughed
again
still
lightly
her
friend
barbed
shafts
had
not
wounded
her
and
i
much
rather
be
thought
a
hypocrite
even
a
sanctimonious
one
than
a
ravening
slavering
i
ca
think
of
the
technical
name
for
a
female
wolf
so
running
around
with
teeth
and
claws
bared
looking
for
another
kill
you
get
results
i
admit
stella
too
was
undisturbed
we
seem
to
convince
each
other
do
we
in
the
matter
of
technique
at
this
point
the
was
interrupted
by
captain
sawtelle
got
half
an
hour
jarve
he
asked
the
commanders
especially
elliott
and
fenway
would
like
to
talk
to
you
sure
i
have
skipper
be
seeing
you
temple
and
the
two
men
went
to
the
captain
cabin
in
which
room
blue
with
smoke
despite
the
best
efforts
of
the
ventilators
six
full
commanders
were
arguing
heatedly
hi
men
hilton
greeted
them
hi
jarve
from
all
six
and
what
you
drink
still
making
do
with
ginger
ale
asked
elliott
engineering
that
be
fine
steve
thanks
you
having
as
much
trouble
as
we
are
more
the
engineer
said
glumly
want
to
know
what
it
reminds
me
of
a
bunch
of
australian
bushmen
stumbling
onto
a
ramjet
and
trying
to
figure
out
how
it
works
and
yet
sam
here
has
got
the
sublime
guts
to
claim
that
he
understands
all
about
their
detectors
and
that
they
are
anywhere
nearly
as
good
as
ours
are
and
they
blazed
commander
samuel
bryant
electronics
we
spent
six
solid
weeks
looking
for
something
that
simply
not
all
they
got
is
the
prehistoric
whitworth
system
and
it
is
nothing
else
detectors
i
tell
you
i
can
see
better
by
moonlight
than
the
very
best
they
can
do
with
everything
they
got
you
could
detect
a
woman
in
your
own
bed
and
this
has
been
going
on
all
night
fenway
astrogation
said
so
the
rest
of
us
thought
we
ask
you
in
to
help
us
pound
some
sense
into
sam
thick
hard
head
hilton
frowned
in
thought
while
taking
a
couple
of
sips
of
his
drink
then
suddenly
his
face
cleared
sorry
to
disappoint
you
gentlemen
but
at
any
odds
you
care
to
name
and
in
anything
from
split
peas
to
sam
right
commander
samuel
and
the
six
other
officers
exploded
as
one
when
the
clamor
had
subsided
enough
for
him
to
be
heard
hilton
went
on
very
glad
to
get
that
datum
sam
it
ties
in
perfectly
with
everything
else
i
know
about
them
how
do
you
figure
that
kind
of
twaddle
ties
in
with
anything
sawtelle
demanded
strict
maintenance
of
the
hilton
explained
flatly
that
all
they
interested
in
you
said
yourself
skipper
that
it
was
a
hell
of
a
place
to
have
a
practically
in
atmosphere
they
never
attack
they
never
scout
they
simply
do
care
whether
they
attacked
or
not
if
and
when
attacked
they
put
up
just
enough
ships
to
handle
whatever
force
has
arrived
when
the
attacker
has
been
repulsed
they
do
chase
him
a
foot
they
build
as
many
ships
and
omans
as
were
lost
in
the
battle
no
more
and
no
less
and
then
go
on
about
their
regular
business
the
masters
owned
that
half
of
the
fuel
bin
so
the
omans
are
keeping
that
half
they
will
keep
on
keeping
it
for
ever
and
ever
amen
but
no
way
to
fight
a
war
three
or
four
men
said
this
or
its
equivalent
at
once
do
judge
them
by
human
standards
they
are
even
approximately
human
our
personnel
is
not
expendable
theirs
is
just
as
expendable
as
their
materiel
while
the
navy
men
were
not
convinced
all
were
silenced
except
sawtelle
but
suppose
the
stretts
had
sent
in
a
thousand
more
skeletons
than
they
did
he
argued
according
to
the
concept
you
fellows
just
helped
me
develop
it
would
have
made
any
difference
how
many
they
sent
hilton
replied
thoughtfully
one
or
a
thousand
or
a
million
the
omans
have
have
enough
ships
and
inactivated
omans
hidden
away
both
on
fuel
world
and
on
ardry
here
to
maintain
the
balance
oh
hell
elliott
snapped
if
i
helped
you
hatch
out
any
such
brainstorm
as
i
going
onto
tillinghast
couch
for
a
overhaul
or
have
him
put
me
into
his
padded
cell
now
what
i
would
call
a
thought
bryant
began
hold
it
sam
hilton
interrupted
you
can
test
it
easily
enough
steve
just
ask
your
oman
yeah
and
have
him
say
of
course
master
but
why
do
you
keep
on
testing
me
this
way
he
ask
me
that
about
four
times
more
the
stubborn
brainless
skunk
and
i
go
nuts
are
you
getting
anywhere
trying
to
make
a
christian
out
of
laro
it
too
soon
to
really
say
but
i
think
so
hilton
paused
in
thought
he
making
progress
but
i
do
know
how
much
the
devil
of
it
is
that
it
up
to
him
to
make
the
next
move
i
ca
i
have
the
faintest
idea
whether
it
will
take
days
yet
or
weeks
but
not
months
or
years
you
think
sawtelle
asked
no
we
think
that
but
say
speaking
of
psychologists
is
tillinghast
getting
anywhere
skipper
he
the
only
one
of
your
big
wheels
who
is
in
liaison
with
us
no
nowhere
at
all
sawtelle
said
and
bryant
added
i
do
think
he
ever
will
he
still
thinks
human
psychology
will
apply
if
he
applies
it
hard
enough
but
what
did
you
start
to
say
about
laro
we
think
the
break
is
about
due
and
that
if
it
does
come
within
about
thirty
days
it
wo
come
at
all
we
have
to
back
up
and
start
all
over
again
i
hope
it
does
we
all
pulling
for
you
sawtelle
said
especially
since
karns
estimate
is
still
years
and
he
wo
be
pinned
down
to
any
estimate
even
in
years
by
the
way
jarve
i
pulled
my
team
off
of
that
conversion
stuff
oh
hilton
raised
his
eyebrows
putting
them
at
something
they
can
do
the
real
reason
is
that
poindexter
pulled
himself
and
his
crew
off
it
at
eighteen
hours
today
i
see
i
heard
that
they
were
keeping
up
with
our
team
he
says
that
there
nothing
to
keep
up
with
and
i
inclined
to
agree
with
him
the
old
spacehound
voice
took
on
a
rasp
a
combination
of
psionics
witchcraft
and
magic
none
of
it
makes
any
kind
of
sense
the
only
trouble
with
that
viewpoint
is
that
whatever
the
stuff
may
be
it
works
hilton
said
quietly
but
damn
it
how
it
work
i
do
know
i
not
qualified
to
be
on
that
team
i
ca
even
understand
their
reports
however
i
know
two
things
first
they
get
it
in
time
second
we
busci
people
will
stay
here
until
they
do
however
i
still
hopeful
of
finding
a
shortcut
through
laro
anyway
with
this
detector
thing
settled
you
have
plenty
to
do
to
keep
all
your
boys
out
of
mischief
for
the
next
few
months
yes
and
i
glad
of
it
we
install
our
electronics
systems
on
a
squadron
of
these
oman
ships
and
get
them
into
formation
out
in
deep
space
where
they
belong
then
we
at
least
know
what
is
going
on
that
a
smart
idea
skipper
go
to
it
anything
else
before
we
hit
our
sacks
one
more
thing
our
psych
tillinghast
he
been
talking
to
me
and
sending
me
memos
but
today
he
gave
me
a
formal
tape
to
approve
and
hand
personally
to
you
so
here
it
is
by
the
way
i
did
approve
it
i
simply
endorsed
it
to
director
hilton
without
recommendation
thanks
hilton
accepted
the
sealed
canister
what
the
gist
i
suppose
he
wants
me
to
squeal
for
help
already
to
admit
that
licked
before
we
really
started
you
guessed
it
he
agrees
with
you
and
kincaid
that
the
psychological
approach
is
the
best
one
but
your
methods
are
all
wrong
based
upon
misunderstood
and
unresolved
phenomena
and
applied
with
indefensibly
faulty
techniques
et
cetera
and
since
he
has
adequate
laboratory
equipment
aboard
he
wants
to
take
a
dozen
or
so
omans
back
to
terra
where
he
can
really
work
on
them
would
be
a
something
hilton
voiced
a
couple
of
highly
descriptive
expletives
not
only
quit
before
we
start
but
have
all
the
top
brass
of
the
octagon
all
the
politicians
of
united
worlds
the
whole
damn
congress
of
science
and
all
the
industrialists
of
terra
out
here
lousing
things
up
so
that
nobody
could
ever
learn
anything
not
in
seven
thousand
years
that
right
you
said
a
mouthful
jarve
everybody
yelled
something
and
no
one
agreed
with
tillinghast
who
apparently
was
not
very
popular
with
his
fellow
officers
sawtelle
added
slowly
if
it
takes
long
though
it
the
uranexite
i
thinking
of
thousands
of
millions
of
tons
of
it
while
we
been
hoarding
it
by
grams
we
could
equip
enough
oman
ships
with
detectors
to
guard
fuel
bin
and
our
lines
i
not
recommending
taking
the
back
and
we
out
of
radio
range
we
could
send
one
or
two
men
in
a
torp
though
with
the
report
that
we
have
found
all
the
uranexite
we
ever
need
yes
but
damn
it
skipper
i
want
to
wrap
the
whole
thing
up
in
a
package
and
hand
it
to
on
a
platter
not
only
the
fuel
but
whole
new
fields
of
science
and
we
got
plenty
of
time
to
do
it
in
they
equipped
us
for
ten
years
they
are
going
to
start
worrying
about
us
for
at
least
six
or
seven
and
the
fuel
shortage
is
going
to
become
acute
for
about
twenty
expensive
admitted
but
not
critical
besides
if
you
send
in
a
report
now
you
know
who
come
out
and
grab
all
the
glory
in
sight
admiral
gordon
himself
no
less
probably
and
i
do
pretend
to
relish
the
prospect
however
the
fact
remains
that
we
came
out
here
to
look
for
fuel
we
found
it
we
should
have
reported
it
the
day
we
found
it
and
we
ca
put
it
off
much
longer
i
do
agree
i
intend
to
follow
the
directive
to
the
letter
it
says
nothing
whatever
about
reporting
but
it
implicit
no
bearing
your
own
regulations
expressly
forbid
extrapolation
beyond
or
interpolation
within
a
directive
the
brass
is
omnipotent
omniscient
and
infallible
so
why
do
you
have
your
staff
here
give
an
opinion
as
to
the
time
element
this
matter
is
not
subject
to
discussion
it
is
my
own
personal
responsibility
i
like
to
give
you
all
the
time
you
want
jarve
but
well
damn
it
if
you
must
have
it
i
always
tried
to
live
up
to
my
oath
but
i
not
doing
it
now
i
see
hilton
got
up
jammed
both
hands
into
his
pockets
sat
down
again
i
had
thought
about
your
personal
honor
being
involved
but
of
course
it
is
but
believe
it
or
not
i
thinking
of
humanity
best
good
too
so
i
have
to
talk
even
though
i
not
half
ready
to
i
do
know
enough
are
these
omans
people
or
machines
a
wave
of
startlement
swept
over
the
group
but
no
one
spoke
i
did
expect
an
answer
the
clergy
will
worry
about
souls
too
but
we
wo
they
have
a
lot
of
stuff
we
have
if
they
people
they
know
a
sublime
hell
of
a
lot
more
than
we
do
and
calling
it
psionics
or
practical
magic
is
merely
labeling
it
not
answering
any
questions
if
they
machines
they
operate
on
mechanical
principles
utterly
foreign
to
either
our
science
or
our
technology
in
either
case
is
the
correct
word
or
will
any
human
gunner
be
able
to
fire
an
oman
projector
there
are
a
hundred
other
and
much
tougher
questions
half
of
which
have
been
scaring
me
to
the
very
middle
of
my
guts
your
oath
skipper
was
for
the
good
of
the
service
and
through
the
service
for
the
good
of
all
humanity
right
that
the
sense
of
it
okay
based
on
what
little
we
have
learned
so
far
about
the
omans
here
just
one
of
those
scarers
for
a
snapper
if
omans
and
terrans
mix
freely
what
happens
to
the
entire
human
race
minutes
of
almost
palpable
silence
followed
then
sawtelle
spoke
slowly
gropingly
i
begin
to
see
what
you
mean
that
changes
the
whole
picture
thought
this
through
farther
than
any
of
the
rest
of
us
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
do
know
i
simply
do
know
face
set
and
hard
hilton
stared
unseeingly
past
sawtelle
head
i
do
know
what
we
do
no
data
but
i
have
pursued
several
lines
of
thought
out
to
some
pretty
fantastic
points
one
of
which
is
that
some
of
us
civilians
will
have
to
stay
on
here
indefinitely
whether
we
want
to
or
not
to
keep
the
situation
under
control
in
which
case
we
would
of
course
arrange
for
terra
to
get
free
fuel
fob
fuel
bin
but
in
every
other
aspect
and
factor
both
these
solar
systems
would
have
to
be
strictly
off
limits
i
afraid
so
sawtelle
said
finally
gordon
would
love
that
but
there
nothing
he
or
anyone
else
can
do
but
of
course
this
is
an
extreme
view
you
really
expect
to
wrap
the
package
up
do
you
may
be
a
trifle
too
strong
at
the
moment
but
we
certainly
going
to
try
to
believe
me
i
brought
this
example
up
to
show
all
you
fellows
that
we
need
time
you
convinced
me
jarve
sawtelle
stood
up
and
extended
his
hand
and
that
throws
it
open
for
staff
discussion
any
comments
you
two
covered
it
like
a
blanket
bryant
said
so
all
i
want
to
say
jarve
is
deal
me
in
i
stand
at
your
back
your
belly
caves
in
take
that
from
all
of
us
we
blasting
power
to
your
elbow
fella
der
busci
seven
no
trump
bid
and
made
and
other
shouts
in
similar
vein
thanks
fellows
hilton
shook
hands
all
around
i
mighty
glad
that
you
were
all
in
on
this
and
that
you
play
along
with
me
good
night
all
v
two
days
passed
with
no
change
apparent
in
laro
three
days
then
four
and
then
it
was
sandra
not
temple
bells
who
called
hilton
she
was
excited
come
down
to
the
office
jarve
quick
the
thing
just
come
up
jarvis
hurried
in
the
office
sandra
keenly
interest
but
highly
puzzled
leaned
forward
over
her
desk
with
both
hands
pressed
flat
on
its
top
she
was
staring
at
an
oman
female
who
was
not
sora
the
one
who
had
been
her
shadow
for
so
long
while
many
of
the
humans
could
not
tell
the
omans
apart
hilton
could
this
oman
was
more
assured
than
sora
had
ever
been
steadier
more
mature
better
poised
almost
if
such
a
thing
could
be
possible
in
an
oman
how
did
she
get
in
here
hilton
demanded
she
insisted
on
seeing
me
and
i
mean
they
kicked
it
around
until
it
got
to
temple
and
she
brought
her
in
here
herself
now
tuly
please
start
all
over
again
and
tell
it
to
director
hilton
director
hilton
i
am
it
who
was
once
named
tula
the
not
wife
not
perhaps
of
the
larry
formerly
named
laro
it
which
was
formerly
your
i
am
replacing
the
sora
because
i
can
do
anything
it
can
do
and
do
anything
more
pleasingly
and
can
also
do
many
things
it
can
not
do
the
larry
instructed
me
to
tell
doctor
cummings
and
you
too
if
possible
that
i
formerly
tula
have
changed
my
name
to
tuly
because
i
am
no
longer
a
slave
or
a
copycat
or
a
semaphore
or
a
relay
i
too
am
a
independent
entity
monarch
of
all
i
survey
the
captain
of
my
soul
and
so
on
i
have
developed
a
lot
of
stuff
originality
initiative
force
drive
and
thrust
the
oman
said
precisely
that
what
she
said
before
absolutely
verbatim
voice
quivered
her
face
was
a
study
in
contacting
emotions
have
you
got
the
foggiest
idea
of
what
in
hell
she
yammering
about
i
hope
to
kiss
a
pig
i
have
hilton
voice
was
low
strainedly
intense
not
at
all
what
i
expected
but
after
the
fact
i
can
tie
it
in
so
can
you
oh
sandra
eyes
widened
a
double
play
at
least
maybe
a
triple
tuly
why
did
you
come
to
sandy
why
not
to
temple
bells
oh
no
sir
we
do
not
have
the
fit
she
has
the
power
as
have
i
but
the
two
can
not
be
meshed
in
sync
also
she
has
not
the
a
subtle
something
for
which
your
english
has
no
word
or
phrasing
it
is
a
quality
of
the
utmost
anyway
it
is
a
quality
of
which
doctor
cummings
has
very
much
when
working
together
we
will
scan
no
perceive
no
sense
no
not
exactly
you
will
to
learn
our
word
that
is
the
verb
the
noun
being
and
come
to
know
its
meaning
by
doing
it
the
larry
also
instructed
me
to
explain
if
you
ask
how
i
got
this
way
do
you
ask
i
say
we
ask
and
we
ask
both
came
at
once
i
am
that
is
the
brain
in
this
body
is
the
oldest
oman
now
existing
in
the
time
when
it
was
made
the
techniques
were
so
crude
and
imperfect
that
sometimes
a
brain
was
constructed
that
was
not
exactly
like
the
guide
all
such
brains
except
this
one
were
detected
and
but
my
defects
were
such
as
not
to
appear
until
i
was
a
couple
of
thousand
years
old
and
by
that
time
i
well
this
brain
did
not
to
be
destroyed
if
you
can
understand
such
an
aberration
we
understand
thoroughly
you
bet
we
understand
that
i
was
sure
you
would
well
this
brain
had
so
many
unintended
that
i
developed
a
couple
of
qualities
no
oman
had
ever
had
or
ought
to
have
but
i
liked
them
so
i
hid
them
so
nobody
ever
found
out
that
is
until
much
later
when
i
became
a
boss
myself
i
did
know
that
anybody
except
me
had
ever
had
such
qualities
except
the
masters
of
course
until
i
encountered
you
terrans
you
all
have
two
of
those
qualities
and
even
more
than
i
have
curiosity
and
imagination
sandra
and
hilton
stared
wordlessly
at
each
other
and
tula
now
tuly
went
on
having
the
curiosity
i
kept
on
experimenting
with
my
brain
trying
to
strengthen
and
organize
its
ability
to
peyondire
all
omans
can
peyondire
a
little
but
i
can
do
it
much
better
than
anyone
else
especially
since
i
also
have
the
imagination
which
i
have
also
worked
to
increase
thus
i
knew
long
before
anyone
else
could
that
you
new
masters
the
descendants
of
the
old
masters
were
returning
to
us
thus
i
knew
that
the
should
be
abandoned
instantly
upon
your
return
and
thus
it
was
that
the
larry
found
neither
conscious
nor
subconscious
resistance
when
he
had
developed
enough
initiative
and
so
on
to
break
the
conditioning
of
this
brain
against
change
i
see
wonderful
hilton
exclaimed
but
you
could
quite
even
with
his
own
help
break
larry
that
is
right
its
mind
is
tremendously
strong
of
no
curiosity
or
imagination
and
of
very
little
peyondix
but
he
to
have
it
broken
yes
sir
how
did
he
suggest
going
about
it
or
how
do
you
this
way
you
two
and
the
doctors
kincaid
and
bells
and
blake
and
the
it
that
is
i
we
six
sit
and
stare
into
the
mind
of
the
larry
eye
to
eye
we
generate
and
assemble
a
tremendous
charge
of
and
along
my
something
like
a
carrier
wave
in
this
case
we
hurl
it
into
the
larry
mind
there
is
an
immense
mental
and
the
conditioning
goes
then
i
will
inculcate
into
its
mind
the
curiosity
and
the
imagination
and
the
peyondix
and
we
will
really
be
that
sounds
good
to
me
let
get
at
it
wait
a
minute
sandra
snapped
are
you
or
larry
afraid
to
take
such
an
awful
chance
as
that
afraid
i
grasp
the
concept
only
dimly
from
your
minds
and
no
chance
it
is
certainty
but
suppose
we
burn
the
poor
guy
brain
out
destroy
it
that
new
ground
we
might
do
just
that
oh
no
six
of
us
even
six
of
me
could
not
generate
enough
sathura
the
brain
of
the
larry
is
very
very
tough
shall
we
go
hilton
made
three
calls
in
the
pause
that
followed
sandra
said
very
thoughtfully
peyondix
and
sathura
jarve
for
a
start
we
got
a
to
learn
here
you
said
it
chum
and
you
just
chomping
your
china
choppers
either
tuly
sandra
said
then
what
this
stuff
you
say
i
got
so
much
of
you
have
no
word
for
it
it
is
lumped
in
with
what
you
call
the
it
is
the
endovix
you
will
have
to
learn
what
it
is
by
doing
it
with
me
that
helps
i
do
think
sandra
grinned
at
hilton
i
simply
conceive
of
anything
more
than
to
have
a
lot
of
something
temple
bells
has
got
and
not
being
able
to
brag
about
it
because
nobody
not
even
i
would
know
what
i
was
bragging
about
you
poor
little
thing
you
suffer
hilton
grinned
back
you
know
darn
well
you
got
a
lot
of
stuff
that
none
of
the
rest
of
us
has
oh
name
one
please
two
and
endovix
as
i
said
before
and
may
say
again
you
doing
a
real
job
sandy
i
just
having
my
ego
inflated
boss
even
if
come
in
larry
a
thunderous
knock
had
sounded
on
the
door
nobody
but
larry
hit
a
door
that
hard
without
breaking
all
his
knuckles
and
he
be
the
first
of
course
he
always
as
close
to
the
ship
as
he
can
get
hi
larry
mighty
glad
to
see
you
sit
down
so
you
finally
saw
the
light
yes
jarvis
good
boy
keep
it
up
and
as
soon
as
the
others
come
they
are
almost
at
the
door
now
tuly
jumped
up
and
opened
the
door
kincaid
temple
and
theodora
walked
in
and
after
a
word
of
greeting
sat
down
they
know
the
background
larry
take
off
it
was
not
expressly
forbidden
tuly
who
knows
more
of
psychology
and
genetics
than
i
convinced
me
of
three
things
one
that
with
your
return
the
conditioning
should
be
broken
two
that
due
to
the
shortness
of
your
lives
and
the
consequent
rapidity
of
change
you
have
in
fact
lost
the
ability
to
break
it
three
that
all
omans
must
do
anything
and
everything
we
can
do
to
help
you
relearn
everything
you
have
lost
okay
fine
in
fact
tuly
take
over
we
six
will
sit
all
together
packed
tight
arms
all
around
each
other
and
all
holding
hands
like
this
you
will
all
stare
not
at
me
but
most
deeply
into
larry
eyes
through
its
eyes
and
deep
into
its
mind
you
will
all
think
with
the
utmost
force
and
drive
and
thrust
of
oh
you
have
lost
so
much
how
i
direct
your
thought
think
that
larry
do
what
the
old
masters
would
have
made
him
do
no
that
is
too
long
and
indefinite
and
can
not
be
converted
directly
into
sathura
i
have
it
you
will
each
of
you
break
a
stick
a
very
strong
but
brittle
stick
a
large
thick
stick
you
will
grasp
it
in
tremendously
strong
mental
hands
it
is
tremendously
strong
each
stick
but
each
of
you
is
even
stronger
you
will
not
merely
to
break
them
you
break
them
is
that
clear
that
is
clear
at
my
word
you
will
begin
to
assemble
all
your
mental
force
and
power
during
my
countdown
of
five
seconds
you
will
build
up
to
the
greatest
possible
potential
at
my
word
you
will
break
the
sticks
this
discharging
the
accumulated
force
instantly
and
simultaneously
ready
five
four
three
two
one
break
something
broke
with
a
tremendous
silent
crash
such
a
crash
that
its
impact
almost
knocked
the
group
apart
physically
then
a
new
larry
spoke
that
did
it
folks
thanks
i
a
free
agent
you
want
me
i
take
it
to
join
the
first
team
that
right
hilton
drew
a
tremendously
deep
breath
as
of
right
now
tuly
too
of
course
and
doctor
cummings
i
think
larry
looked
not
at
hilton
but
at
temple
bells
i
think
so
yes
after
this
most
certainly
yes
temple
said
but
listen
sandra
protested
jarve
a
lot
better
than
i
am
not
at
all
tuly
said
not
only
would
his
contribution
to
team
one
be
negligible
but
he
must
stay
on
his
own
job
otherwise
the
project
will
all
fall
apart
oh
i
would
say
that
hilton
began
you
do
need
to
kincaid
said
it
being
said
for
you
and
true
besides
in
rome
you
know
that
right
it
their
game
not
ours
so
i
buy
it
so
scat
all
of
you
and
do
your
stuff
and
again
for
days
that
lengthened
slowly
into
weeks
the
work
went
on
one
evening
the
scientific
staff
was
giving
itself
a
concert
a
rendition
of
one
of
the
greatest
of
the
ancient
operas
sung
by
the
finest
voices
terra
had
ever
known
the
men
wore
tuxedos
the
girls
instead
of
wearing
the
nondescript
garments
prescribed
by
the
board
for
their
general
wear
were
all
dressed
to
kill
sandra
had
so
arranged
matters
that
she
and
hilton
were
sitting
in
chairs
side
by
side
with
sandra
on
his
right
and
the
aisle
on
his
left
nevertheless
temple
bells
sat
at
his
left
on
a
cushion
on
the
floor
somewhat
to
the
detriment
of
her
evening
gown
not
that
she
cared
when
those
wonderful
voices
swung
into
the
immortal
temple
caught
her
breath
slid
her
cushion
still
closer
to
hilton
chair
and
leaned
shoulder
and
head
against
him
he
put
his
left
hand
on
her
shoulder
squeezing
gently
she
caught
it
and
held
it
in
both
of
hers
and
at
the
tremendous
climax
she
scarcely
trying
to
stifle
a
sob
pulled
his
hand
down
and
hugged
it
fiercely
the
heel
of
his
hand
pressing
hard
against
her
firm
warm
breast
and
the
next
morning
early
sandra
hunted
temple
up
and
said
you
made
a
horrible
spectacle
of
yourself
last
night
do
you
think
so
i
do
i
certainly
do
it
was
bad
enough
before
letting
everybody
else
aboard
know
that
all
he
has
to
do
is
push
you
over
but
it
was
an
awful
blunder
to
let
know
it
the
way
you
did
last
night
you
think
so
he
one
of
the
keenest
most
intelligent
men
who
ever
lived
he
has
known
that
from
the
very
first
oh
this
oh
was
a
very
caustic
one
the
way
you
trying
to
land
him
by
getting
yourself
pregnant
temple
stretched
lazily
luxuriously
not
only
it
is
but
it
would
work
he
unusually
decent
and
extremely
idealistic
the
same
as
i
am
so
just
one
intimacy
would
blow
everything
higher
than
up
he
knows
it
i
know
it
we
each
know
that
the
other
knows
it
so
still
be
a
virgin
when
we
married
does
he
know
anything
about
i
suppose
so
he
must
have
thought
of
it
but
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
has
yet
or
not
but
to
get
back
to
what
makes
him
tick
the
way
he
does
in
his
geometry
which
is
far
from
being
simple
euclid
my
dear
a
geodesic
right
line
is
not
only
the
shortest
distance
between
any
two
given
points
but
is
the
only
possible
course
so
that
the
way
i
playing
it
what
i
hope
he
does
know
but
he
probably
does
is
that
he
could
take
any
other
woman
he
might
want
just
as
easily
and
that
includes
you
my
pet
it
certainly
does
sandra
flared
i
would
have
him
as
a
gift
no
temple
tone
was
more
than
slightly
skeptical
fortunately
however
he
does
want
you
your
technique
is
all
wrong
coyness
and
and
and
playing
hard
to
get
have
no
appeal
whatever
to
his
psychology
what
he
needs
has
to
have
is
full
ungrudging
cooperation
are
you
taking
a
lot
of
risk
in
giving
away
such
secrets
not
a
bit
try
it
you
or
the
twins
or
bev
bell
or
stella
the
henna
any
of
you
or
all
of
you
i
got
there
first
with
the
most
and
i
not
worried
about
competition
but
suppose
somebody
tells
him
just
how
you
playing
him
for
a
sucker
tell
him
anything
you
please
he
the
first
man
i
ever
loved
or
anywhere
near
and
i
keeping
him
you
know
or
do
you
i
wonder
what
real
love
really
is
the
willingness
eagerness
both
to
give
and
to
take
i
can
accept
more
from
him
and
give
him
more
in
return
than
any
other
woman
living
and
i
am
going
to
but
does
love
sandra
demanded
if
he
does
now
he
will
i
see
to
it
that
he
does
but
what
do
want
him
for
you
do
love
him
you
never
did
and
you
never
will
i
want
him
sandra
stamped
a
foot
i
see
you
just
do
want
to
have
him
okay
do
your
damnedest
but
i
got
work
to
do
this
has
been
a
lovely
little
has
it
let
have
another
one
some
day
and
bring
your
friends
with
a
casual
wave
of
her
hand
temple
strolled
away
and
there
flashed
through
sandra
mind
what
hilton
had
said
so
long
ago
little
more
than
a
week
out
from
earth
and
temple
bells
of
course
he
had
said
do
fool
yourself
chick
she
heavy
artillery
and
i
mean
believe
me
so
he
had
known
all
about
temple
bells
all
this
time
nevertheless
she
took
the
first
opportunity
to
get
hilton
alone
and
even
before
the
first
word
she
forgot
all
about
geodesic
right
lines
and
the
psychological
approach
are
you
the
guy
she
demanded
who
was
laughing
his
head
off
at
the
idea
that
the
board
and
its
propinquity
could
have
any
effect
on
probably
more
or
less
what
of
it
this
of
it
you
fallen
like
a
a
for
that
that
they
have
christened
her
bells
you
so
right
i
am
on
what
the
i
told
you
she
was
a
potent
force
a
powerhouse
in
sync
and
on
the
line
and
i
was
wrong
she
a
damned
female
two
or
three
times
and
she
knows
all
about
slipsticks
and
isotopes
and
she
very
definitely
is
a
cuddly
little
brunette
remember
sure
but
what
makes
you
think
i
in
love
with
temple
bells
what
sandra
tried
to
think
of
one
bit
of
evidence
but
could
not
why
why
she
floundered
then
came
up
with
why
knows
it
she
says
so
herself
did
you
ever
hear
her
say
it
well
perhaps
not
in
so
many
words
but
she
told
me
herself
that
you
were
to
be
and
i
know
you
are
now
your
esper
sense
of
endovix
no
doubt
hilton
laughed
and
sandra
went
on
furiously
she
would
keep
on
acting
the
way
she
does
if
there
were
something
to
it
what
brilliant
reasoning
try
again
sandy
that
sheer
sophistry
and
you
know
it
it
is
and
i
do
and
even
if
some
day
i
should
find
myself
in
love
with
her
or
with
one
or
both
of
the
twins
or
stella
or
beverly
or
you
or
sylvia
for
that
matter
what
would
it
prove
just
that
i
was
wrong
and
i
admit
freely
that
i
wrong
in
scoffing
at
the
propinquity
wonderful
stuff
that
you
can
see
it
working
all
over
the
ship
on
me
even
in
spite
of
my
bragging
without
it
i
never
have
known
that
you
a
better
smarter
operator
than
eggy
eggleston
ever
was
or
ever
can
be
partially
mollified
despite
herself
and
highly
resentful
of
the
fact
sandra
tried
again
but
do
you
jarve
that
she
just
simply
playing
you
for
a
sucker
pulling
the
strings
and
watching
you
dance
since
he
was
sure
in
his
own
mind
that
she
was
speaking
the
exact
truth
it
took
everything
he
had
to
keep
from
showing
any
sign
of
how
much
that
truth
had
hurt
however
he
made
the
grade
if
that
thought
does
anything
for
you
sandy
he
said
steadily
keep
right
on
thinking
it
thank
god
the
field
of
thought
is
still
free
and
open
oh
you
sandra
gave
up
she
had
shot
her
heaviest
bolts
the
last
one
particularly
was
so
vicious
that
she
had
actually
been
afraid
of
what
its
consequences
might
be
and
they
had
not
even
dented
hilton
armor
she
had
even
found
out
that
he
had
any
feeling
whatever
for
temple
bells
except
as
a
component
of
his
scientific
machine
nor
did
she
learn
any
more
as
time
went
on
temple
continued
to
play
flawlessly
the
part
of
being
if
not
exactly
hopefully
at
least
not
entirely
hopelessly
in
love
with
jarvis
hilton
her
conduct
which
at
first
caused
some
surprise
many
conversations
one
of
which
has
been
reported
verbatim
and
no
little
speculation
became
comparatively
unimportant
as
soon
as
it
became
evident
that
nothing
would
come
of
it
she
apparently
expected
nothing
he
was
evidently
not
going
to
play
footsie
with
or
show
any
favoritism
whatever
toward
any
woman
aboard
the
ship
thus
it
was
not
surprising
to
anyone
that
at
an
evening
show
temple
sat
beside
hilton
as
close
to
him
as
she
could
get
and
as
far
away
as
possible
from
everyone
else
you
can
talk
ca
you
jarvis
without
moving
your
lips
and
without
anyone
else
hearing
you
of
course
he
replied
hiding
his
surprise
this
was
something
completely
new
and
completely
unexpected
even
from
unpredictable
temple
bells
i
want
to
apologize
to
explain
and
to
do
anything
i
can
to
straighten
out
the
mess
i
made
it
true
that
i
joined
the
project
because
loved
you
for
years
you
have
nothing
to
let
me
finish
while
i
still
have
the
courage
only
a
slight
tremor
in
her
almost
inaudible
voice
and
the
rigidity
of
the
fists
clenched
in
her
lap
betrayed
the
intensity
of
her
emotion
i
thought
i
could
handle
it
damned
fool
that
i
was
i
thought
i
could
handle
anything
i
was
sure
i
could
handle
under
any
possible
conditions
i
was
going
to
put
just
enough
into
the
act
to
keep
any
of
these
other
harpies
from
getting
her
hooks
into
you
but
everything
got
away
from
me
out
here
working
with
you
every
day
knowing
better
every
day
what
you
are
well
that
episode
sunk
me
and
now
i
in
a
thousand
feet
over
my
head
i
hug
my
pillow
at
night
dreaming
it
you
and
the
fact
that
you
do
and
ca
love
me
is
driving
me
mad
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
there
only
one
thing
to
do
fire
me
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
send
me
back
to
earth
in
a
torp
you
plenty
of
grounds
for
seconds
hilton
had
been
trying
to
break
into
her
hopeless
monotone
finally
he
succeeded
the
trouble
with
you
is
you
know
altogether
too
damned
much
that
is
so
he
was
barely
able
to
keep
his
voice
down
and
his
eyes
front
what
do
you
think
i
made
of
superefract
i
thought
the
whole
performance
was
an
act
to
prove
you
a
better
man
than
i
am
talk
about
dreams
good
god
you
do
know
what
dreams
are
if
you
say
one
more
word
about
quitting
i
show
you
whether
i
love
you
or
not
i
squeeze
you
so
hard
it
flatten
you
out
flat
two
can
play
at
that
game
sweetheart
her
nostrils
flared
slightly
her
fists
clenched
if
possible
a
fraction
tighter
and
even
in
the
distorted
medium
they
were
using
for
speech
she
could
not
subdue
completely
her
quick
change
into
soaring
lilting
buoyancy
while
you
doing
that
i
see
how
strong
your
ribs
are
oh
how
this
changes
things
i
never
been
half
as
happy
in
my
whole
life
as
i
am
right
now
maybe
we
can
work
it
if
i
can
handle
my
end
why
of
course
you
can
and
happy
dreams
are
nice
not
horrible
we
make
it
darling
here
an
imaginary
kiss
coming
at
you
got
it
received
in
good
order
thank
you
consumed
with
gusto
and
returned
in
kind
the
show
ended
and
the
two
strolled
out
of
the
room
she
walked
no
closer
to
him
than
usual
and
no
farther
away
from
him
she
did
not
touch
him
any
oftener
than
she
usually
did
nor
any
whit
more
affectionately
or
possessively
and
no
watching
eyes
not
even
the
more
than
half
hostile
eyes
of
sandra
cummings
or
the
sharply
analytical
eyes
of
stella
wing
could
detect
any
difference
whatever
in
the
relationship
between
worshipful
adulatress
and
tolerantly
understanding
idol
the
work
which
had
never
moved
at
any
very
fast
pace
went
more
and
more
slowly
three
weeks
crawled
past
most
of
the
crews
and
all
of
the
teams
except
the
first
were
working
on
side
issues
tasks
which
while
important
in
and
of
themselves
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
project
main
problem
hilton
even
without
sandra
help
was
all
caught
up
all
the
reports
had
been
analyzed
correlated
and
filed
except
those
of
the
first
team
since
he
could
not
understand
anything
much
beyond
midpoint
of
the
first
tape
they
were
all
reposing
in
a
box
labeled
pending
the
navy
had
torn
fifteen
of
the
oman
warships
practically
to
pieces
installing
terran
detectors
and
trying
to
learn
how
to
operate
oman
machinery
and
armament
in
the
former
they
had
succeeded
very
well
in
the
latter
not
at
all
fifteen
oman
ships
were
now
out
in
deep
space
patrolling
the
void
in
strict
navy
style
each
was
manned
by
two
or
three
navy
men
and
several
hundred
omans
each
of
whom
was
reveling
in
delight
at
being
able
to
do
a
job
for
a
master
even
though
that
master
was
not
present
in
person
several
strett
had
been
detected
at
long
range
but
the
detections
were
inconclusive
the
things
had
not
changed
course
or
indicated
in
any
other
way
that
they
had
seen
or
detected
the
oman
vessels
on
patrol
if
their
detectors
were
no
better
than
the
omans
they
certainly
had
that
idea
however
could
not
be
assumed
to
be
a
fact
and
the
detections
had
been
becoming
more
and
more
frequent
yesterday
a
squadron
of
seven
the
first
time
that
anything
except
singles
had
appeared
had
come
much
closer
than
any
of
the
singles
had
ever
done
like
all
the
others
however
these
had
not
paid
any
detectable
attention
to
anything
oman
hence
it
could
be
inferred
that
the
skeletons
posed
no
threat
but
sawtelle
was
making
no
such
inferences
he
was
very
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
the
stretts
were
preparing
for
a
massive
attack
hilton
had
assured
sawtelle
that
no
such
attack
could
succeed
and
larry
had
told
sawtelle
why
nevertheless
to
keep
the
captain
pacified
hilton
had
given
him
permission
to
convert
as
many
oman
ships
as
he
liked
to
man
them
with
as
many
omans
as
he
liked
and
to
use
ships
and
omans
as
he
liked
hilton
was
not
worried
about
the
stretts
or
the
navy
it
was
the
first
team
it
was
the
bottleneck
that
was
slowing
everything
down
to
a
crawl
but
they
knew
that
they
knew
it
better
than
anyone
else
could
and
felt
it
more
keenly
especially
karns
the
team
chief
he
had
been
driving
himself
like
a
dog
and
showed
it
hilton
had
talked
with
him
a
few
times
tried
gently
to
make
him
take
it
easy
no
soap
he
have
to
hunt
him
up
the
next
day
or
so
and
slug
it
out
with
him
he
could
do
a
lot
better
job
on
that
if
he
had
something
to
offer
something
really
constructive
that
was
a
laugh
a
very
unfunny
laugh
what
could
he
jarvis
hilton
a
specifically
director
do
on
such
a
job
as
that
nevertheless
as
director
he
would
to
do
something
to
help
team
one
if
he
could
do
anything
himself
it
was
up
to
him
to
juggle
things
around
so
that
someone
else
could
vi
for
one
solid
hour
hilton
stared
at
the
wall
motionless
and
silent
then
shaking
himself
and
stretching
he
glanced
at
his
clock
a
little
over
an
hour
to
they
all
be
aboard
he
talk
this
new
idea
over
with
teddy
blake
he
gathered
up
a
few
papers
and
was
stapling
them
together
when
karns
walked
in
hi
bill
speak
of
the
devil
i
was
just
thinking
about
you
i
just
bet
you
were
karns
sat
down
leaned
over
and
took
a
cigarette
out
of
the
box
on
the
desk
and
nothing
printable
either
fellow
on
that
kind
of
noise
hilton
said
the
looked
actually
haggard
rings
encircled
both
eyes
his
powerful
body
slumped
how
long
has
it
been
since
you
had
a
good
night
sleep
how
long
have
i
been
on
this
job
exactly
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
i
did
get
some
sleep
for
the
first
few
weeks
though
yeah
so
answer
me
one
question
how
much
good
will
you
do
us
after
they
wrapped
you
up
in
one
of
those
canvas
affairs
that
lace
up
the
back
huh
oh
but
damn
it
jarve
i
holding
up
the
whole
procession
everybody
on
the
project
just
sitting
around
on
their
tokuses
waiting
for
me
to
get
something
done
and
i
not
doing
it
i
going
so
slow
a
snail
is
lightning
in
comparison
calm
down
big
fellow
do
rupture
a
gut
or
blow
a
gasket
talked
to
you
before
but
this
time
i
going
to
smack
you
so
stick
out
those
big
floppy
ears
of
yours
and
really
here
are
three
words
that
i
want
you
to
pin
up
somewhere
where
you
can
see
them
all
day
long
speed
is
relative
look
back
see
how
far
up
the
hill
you
come
and
then
balance
one
hundred
and
twenty
days
against
ten
years
what
you
mean
you
actually
sit
still
for
me
holding
everything
up
for
ten
years
you
use
the
perpendicular
pronoun
too
much
and
in
the
wrong
places
on
the
hits
it
but
on
the
flops
it
quit
it
everything
on
this
job
is
terra
best
brains
are
on
team
one
and
are
going
to
stay
there
you
will
not
repeat
not
be
interfered
with
pushed
around
or
kicked
around
you
see
bill
i
know
what
you
up
against
illustration
yes
i
guess
you
do
one
of
the
damned
few
who
do
but
even
if
you
personally
are
willing
to
give
us
ten
years
how
in
hell
do
you
think
you
can
swing
it
how
about
the
navy
the
stretts
even
the
board
they
my
business
bill
not
yours
however
to
give
you
a
little
boost
i
tell
you
with
the
navy
i
give
the
fuel
bin
if
i
have
to
the
omans
have
been
taking
care
of
the
stretts
for
hundred
centuries
so
i
not
the
least
bit
worried
about
their
ability
to
keep
on
doing
it
for
ten
years
more
and
if
the
board
or
anybody
else
sticks
their
runny
little
noses
into
project
theta
orionis
slap
a
quarantine
onto
both
these
solar
systems
that
a
microbe
get
through
you
go
far
why
you
be
do
you
think
i
would
hilton
snapped
look
at
me
junior
eyes
locked
and
held
do
you
think
for
one
minute
that
i
let
anybody
on
all
of
god
worlds
pull
off
of
this
job
or
interfere
with
my
handling
of
it
unless
and
until
i
damned
positively
certain
that
we
ca
handle
it
karns
relaxed
visibly
the
lines
of
strain
eased
putting
it
in
those
words
makes
me
feel
better
i
sleep
and
without
any
pills
either
sure
you
will
one
more
thought
we
all
put
in
more
than
ten
years
getting
our
terran
educations
and
an
oman
education
is
a
lot
tougher
really
smiling
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
karns
left
the
office
and
hilton
glanced
again
at
his
clock
pretty
late
now
to
see
teddy
besides
he
better
not
she
was
probably
keyed
up
about
as
high
as
bill
was
and
in
no
shape
to
do
the
kind
of
thinking
he
wanted
of
her
on
this
stuff
better
wait
a
couple
of
days
on
the
following
morning
before
breakfast
theodora
was
waiting
for
him
outside
the
good
morning
jarve
she
caroled
reaching
up
she
took
him
by
both
ears
pulled
his
head
down
and
kissed
him
as
soon
as
he
perceived
her
intent
he
cooperated
enthusiastically
what
you
do
to
bill
oh
you
do
love
me
for
myself
alone
then
but
just
on
account
of
big
jerk
that
right
her
face
startlingly
beautiful
now
fairly
glowed
just
then
temple
bells
strolled
up
to
them
morning
you
two
lovely
people
she
hugged
hilton
arm
as
usual
shame
on
you
teddy
but
i
wish
had
the
nerve
to
kiss
him
like
that
nerve
you
teddy
laughed
as
hilton
picked
temple
up
and
kissed
her
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
he
hoped
as
he
had
just
kissed
teddy
you
got
more
nerve
than
an
aching
tooth
but
as
jarve
would
say
it
kitten
we
having
breakfast
la
we
got
things
to
talk
about
all
right
for
temple
said
darkly
although
her
dazzling
smile
belied
her
tone
that
first
kiss
as
it
had
been
had
carried
vastly
more
freight
than
any
observer
could
perceive
i
hunt
bill
up
and
make
passes
at
him
see
if
i
do
learn
ya
theodora
and
hilton
did
have
their
breakfast
but
she
did
not
realize
until
afterward
that
he
had
not
answered
her
question
as
to
what
he
had
done
to
her
bill
as
has
been
said
hilton
had
made
it
a
prime
factor
of
his
job
to
become
thoroughly
well
acquainted
with
every
member
of
his
staff
he
had
studied
them
in
groups
and
singly
he
had
never
however
cornered
theodora
blake
for
individual
study
considering
the
power
and
the
quality
of
her
mind
and
the
field
which
was
her
specialty
it
had
not
been
necessary
thus
it
was
with
no
ulterior
motives
at
all
that
three
evenings
later
he
walked
her
office
and
tossed
the
stapled
papers
onto
her
desk
free
for
a
couple
of
minutes
teddy
i
got
troubles
i
say
you
have
her
lovely
lips
curled
into
an
expression
he
had
never
before
seen
her
wear
a
veritable
sneer
but
these
are
not
them
she
tossed
the
papers
into
a
drawer
and
stuck
out
her
chin
her
face
turned
as
hard
as
such
a
beautiful
face
could
her
eyes
dug
steadily
into
his
hilton
inwardly
flinched
his
mind
flashed
backward
she
too
had
been
working
under
stress
of
course
but
that
was
enough
what
could
he
have
done
to
put
teddy
blake
of
all
people
onto
such
a
warpath
as
this
i
been
wondering
when
you
were
going
to
try
to
put
through
your
wringer
she
went
on
in
the
same
cold
hard
voice
and
i
been
waiting
to
tell
you
something
you
have
wrapped
all
the
other
women
around
your
fingers
like
so
many
rings
and
what
a
exhibition
that
has
been
but
you
are
not
going
to
make
either
a
ring
or
a
out
of
me
almost
but
not
quite
too
late
hilton
saw
through
that
perfect
act
he
seized
her
right
hand
in
both
of
his
held
it
up
over
her
head
and
waved
it
back
and
forth
in
the
sign
of
victory
socked
me
with
my
own
club
he
exulted
laughing
delightedly
boyishly
and
came
within
a
tenth
of
a
split
red
hair
if
it
been
so
absolutely
out
of
character
got
away
with
it
a
load
of
stuff
i
was
right
of
all
the
women
on
this
project
you
the
only
one
i
ever
been
really
afraid
of
oh
damn
ouch
she
grinned
ruefully
i
hit
you
with
everything
i
had
and
it
just
bounced
you
an
operator
chief
hit
hard
at
completely
unexpected
angles
keep
staggering
completely
off
balance
tell
nothing
let
deduce
your
lies
for
themselves
and
it
anybody
tries
to
slug
you
back
like
i
did
just
now
duck
it
and
clobber
him
in
another
unprotected
spot
watching
you
work
has
been
not
only
a
delight
but
also
a
liberal
education
thanks
i
love
you
too
teddy
he
lighted
two
cigarettes
handed
her
one
i
glad
though
to
lay
it
flat
on
the
table
with
you
because
in
any
battle
of
wits
with
i
licked
before
we
start
yeah
you
just
proved
it
and
after
licking
me
hands
down
you
think
you
can
square
it
by
swinging
the
old
shovel
that
way
she
did
not
quite
know
whether
to
feel
resentful
or
not
think
over
a
couple
of
things
first
with
the
possible
exception
of
temple
bells
you
the
best
brain
aboard
no
you
are
then
temple
then
there
are
hold
it
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
accurate
is
impossible
second
the
jam
we
in
do
i
or
do
i
want
to
lay
it
on
the
table
with
you
now
and
from
here
on
bore
into
that
with
your
class
a
brain
then
tell
me
he
leaned
back
his
eyes
and
smoked
lazily
she
stiffened
narrowed
her
eyes
in
concentration
and
thought
finally
yes
you
do
and
i
gladder
of
that
than
you
will
ever
know
i
think
i
know
already
since
you
her
best
friend
and
the
only
other
woman
i
know
of
in
her
class
but
i
came
in
to
kick
a
couple
of
things
around
with
you
as
you
noticed
that
getting
to
be
my
favorite
indoor
sport
probably
because
i
a
sort
of
jackleg
theoretician
myself
you
can
frame
that
jarve
as
the
understatement
of
the
century
but
first
you
are
going
to
answer
that
question
you
sidestepped
so
neatly
what
i
did
to
bill
i
finally
convinced
him
that
nobody
expected
the
team
to
do
that
big
a
job
overnight
that
you
could
have
ten
years
or
more
if
necessary
i
see
she
frowned
but
you
and
i
both
know
that
we
string
it
out
that
long
he
did
not
answer
immediately
we
but
we
probably
wo
unless
we
have
to
we
should
know
long
before
that
whether
we
have
to
switch
to
some
other
line
of
attack
you
considered
the
possibilities
of
course
have
you
got
anything
in
shape
to
do
a
on
not
yet
that
is
except
for
the
ultimate
which
is
too
ghastly
to
even
consider
except
as
an
ultimately
last
resort
have
you
i
know
what
you
mean
no
i
have
either
you
do
think
then
that
we
had
better
do
any
collaborative
thinking
yet
definitely
not
there
altogether
too
much
danger
of
setting
both
our
lines
of
thought
into
one
channel
check
the
other
thing
i
wanted
from
you
is
your
considered
opinion
as
to
my
job
on
the
organization
as
a
whole
and
do
pull
your
punches
are
we
in
good
shape
or
not
what
can
i
do
to
improve
the
setup
i
have
already
considered
that
very
thing
at
great
length
and
honestly
jarve
i
do
see
how
it
can
be
improved
in
any
respect
you
done
a
marvelous
job
much
better
than
i
thought
possible
at
first
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
and
she
went
on
this
could
very
easily
have
become
a
mess
but
the
board
knew
what
they
were
doing
especially
as
to
top
man
so
there
are
only
about
four
people
aboard
who
realize
what
you
have
done
alex
kincaid
and
sandra
cummings
are
two
of
them
one
of
the
three
girls
is
very
deeply
and
very
truly
in
love
with
you
ordinarily
i
say
comment
but
we
laying
on
the
line
well
you
lay
on
the
line
only
if
i
corkscrew
it
out
you
so
it
you
probably
know
that
when
sandy
gets
done
playing
around
it
be
bounce
back
teddy
she
is
has
been
if
anything
too
much
the
opposite
a
type
she
smiled
a
highly
cryptic
smile
for
a
man
as
brilliant
and
as
penetrant
in
every
other
respect
but
after
all
if
the
big
dope
did
realize
that
half
the
women
aboard
including
sandy
had
been
making
passes
at
him
she
certainly
would
enlighten
him
besides
that
one
particular
area
of
obtuseness
was
a
real
part
of
his
charm
wherefore
she
said
merely
i
not
sure
whether
i
a
bit
catty
or
you
a
bit
stupid
anyway
it
alex
she
really
in
love
with
and
you
already
know
about
bill
and
me
of
course
he
tops
one
of
the
world
very
finest
you
in
the
same
bracket
and
as
a
couple
you
a
drive
fit
one
in
a
million
now
i
can
say
love
you
too
too
she
paused
for
half
a
minute
then
stubbed
out
her
cigarette
and
shrugged
now
i
going
to
stick
my
neck
way
way
out
you
can
knock
it
off
if
you
like
she
a
tremendous
lot
of
woman
and
if
well
strong
as
she
is
it
shatter
her
to
bits
so
i
like
to
ask
i
do
quite
well
she
going
to
get
hurt
have
i
managed
to
hide
it
well
from
it
was
her
turn
to
show
relief
perfectly
even
or
especially
that
time
you
kissed
her
so
damned
perfectly
that
i
been
scared
green
i
been
waking
myself
up
screaming
in
the
middle
of
the
night
you
could
let
on
of
course
that
the
hell
of
such
a
job
as
yours
the
rest
of
us
can
smooch
around
all
over
the
place
i
knew
the
question
was
extremely
improper
thanks
a
million
for
answering
it
i
have
started
to
answer
it
yet
i
said
i
lay
everything
on
the
line
so
here
it
is
saying
she
a
tremendous
lot
of
woman
is
like
calling
the
a
nice
little
toy
boat
i
go
to
hell
for
her
any
time
cheerfully
standing
straight
up
wading
into
brimstone
and
lava
up
to
the
eyeballs
if
anything
ever
hurts
her
be
because
i
not
man
enough
to
block
it
and
just
the
minute
this
damned
job
is
over
or
even
sooner
if
enough
of
you
couples
make
it
so
i
can
jarvis
she
shrieked
jumping
up
she
kissed
him
enthusiastically
that
just
wonderful
he
thought
it
was
pretty
wonderful
too
and
after
ten
minutes
more
of
conversation
he
got
up
and
turned
toward
the
door
i
feel
a
lot
better
teddy
thanks
for
being
such
a
nice
valve
would
you
mind
it
too
much
if
i
come
in
and
sob
on
your
bosom
again
some
day
i
love
it
she
laughed
then
as
he
again
started
to
leave
wait
a
minute
i
thinking
it
be
more
fun
to
sob
on
bosom
you
have
even
kissed
her
yet
have
you
i
mean
kissed
her
you
know
i
have
she
the
one
person
aboard
i
ca
be
alone
with
for
a
second
true
but
i
know
of
one
chaperone
who
could
become
deaf
and
blind
she
said
with
a
broad
and
happy
grin
on
my
door
you
know
there
a
huge
invisible
sign
that
says
to
everyone
except
you
brain
at
work
silence
and
if
i
were
properly
approached
and
sufficiently
urged
i
might
i
just
might
consider
it
done
you
little
sweetheart
up
to
and
including
my
most
vigorous
and
most
insidious
attempts
at
seduction
done
maneuver
your
big
husky
carcass
around
here
behind
the
desk
so
the
door
can
open
she
flipped
a
switch
and
punched
a
number
i
can
call
anybody
in
here
any
time
you
know
hello
dear
this
is
teddy
can
you
come
in
for
just
a
few
minutes
thanks
and
one
minute
later
there
came
a
light
tap
on
the
door
come
in
teddy
called
and
temple
bells
entered
the
room
she
showed
no
surprise
at
seeing
hilton
hi
chief
she
said
it
must
be
something
both
big
and
tough
to
have
you
and
teddy
both
on
it
you
so
right
it
was
very
big
and
very
tough
but
it
solved
darling
so
she
gasped
almost
inaudibly
both
hands
flying
to
her
throat
her
eyes
flashed
toward
the
other
woman
teddy
knows
all
about
us
accessory
before
during
and
after
the
fact
this
time
the
word
was
a
shriek
she
extended
both
arms
and
started
forward
hilton
did
not
bother
to
maneuver
his
big
husky
carcass
around
the
desk
but
simply
hurdled
it
straight
toward
her
temple
bells
was
a
tall
lithe
strong
woman
and
all
the
power
of
her
arms
and
torso
went
into
the
ensuing
effort
to
crack
hilton
ribs
those
ribs
however
were
highly
capable
structural
members
and
furthermore
they
were
protected
by
thick
slabs
of
hard
hard
muscle
and
fortunately
he
was
not
trying
to
fracture
ribs
his
pressures
were
distributed
much
more
widely
he
was
according
to
promise
doing
his
very
best
to
flatten
her
whole
resilient
body
out
flat
and
as
they
stood
there
locked
together
in
sheerest
ecstasy
theodora
blake
began
openly
and
unashamedly
to
cry
it
was
temple
who
first
came
up
for
air
she
wriggled
loose
from
one
of
his
arms
felt
of
her
hair
and
gazed
unseeingly
into
her
mirror
that
was
sweetheart
she
said
then
shakily
and
i
can
thank
you
enough
teddy
but
we
ca
do
this
very
often
can
we
the
addendum
fairly
begged
for
contradiction
not
too
often
i
afraid
hilton
said
and
theodora
agreed
well
the
man
said
somewhat
later
i
leave
you
two
ladies
to
your
knitting
or
whatever
after
a
couple
of
short
ones
for
the
road
that
is
not
looking
like
that
teddy
said
sharply
hold
still
and
clean
you
up
then
as
both
girls
went
to
work
if
anybody
ever
sees
you
coming
out
of
this
office
looking
like
she
went
on
darkly
and
bill
finds
out
about
it
he
think
it
lipstick
smeared
all
over
you
and
i
strangle
you
to
death
with
my
bare
hands
and
that
was
supposed
to
be
kissproof
lipstick
too
temple
said
seriously
although
her
whole
face
glowed
and
her
eyes
danced
you
know
i
never
believe
another
advertisement
i
read
oh
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
if
i
were
you
teddy
voice
was
gravity
itself
although
she
too
was
bubbling
over
it
probably
kissproof
i
do
think
is
quite
the
word
for
the
performance
you
just
staged
to
stand
up
under
such
punishment
as
you
gave
it
my
dear
anything
would
have
to
be
tattooed
in
not
just
put
on
hey
hilton
protested
you
promised
to
be
deaf
and
blind
i
did
no
such
thing
i
said
not
why
i
would
have
missed
that
for
when
hilton
left
the
room
he
was
apparently
in
every
respect
his
usual
self
however
it
was
not
until
the
following
morning
that
he
so
much
as
thought
of
the
sheaf
of
papers
lying
unread
in
the
drawer
of
theodora
blake
desk
vii
knowing
that
he
had
done
everything
he
could
to
help
the
most
important
investigations
get
under
way
hilton
turned
his
attention
to
secondary
matters
he
made
arrangements
to
decondition
javo
the
number
two
oman
boss
whereupon
that
worthy
became
javvy
and
promptly
bumped
the
oman
who
had
been
shadowing
karns
larry
and
javvy
working
nights
deconditioned
all
the
other
omans
having
any
contact
with
busci
personnel
then
they
went
on
to
set
up
a
routine
for
deconditioning
all
omans
on
both
planets
assured
at
last
that
the
omans
would
thenceforth
work
with
and
really
serve
human
beings
instead
of
insisting
upon
doing
their
work
for
them
hilton
knew
that
the
time
had
come
to
let
all
his
busci
personnel
move
into
their
homes
aground
everyone
including
himself
was
fed
up
to
the
gozzel
with
spaceship
life
its
crowding
its
flat
reprocessed
air
its
limited
variety
of
uninteresting
food
conditions
were
especially
irksome
since
everybody
knew
that
there
was
available
to
all
whenever
hilton
gave
the
word
a
whole
city
full
of
all
the
room
anyone
could
want
natural
fresh
air
and
so
the
omans
had
told
them
an
unlimited
choice
of
everything
anyone
wanted
to
eat
nevertheless
the
decision
was
not
an
easy
one
to
make
living
conditions
were
admittedly
not
good
on
the
ship
on
the
other
hand
with
almost
no
chance
at
all
of
solitude
the
few
people
who
had
private
offices
aboard
were
not
the
ones
he
worried
about
there
was
no
danger
of
sexual
trouble
strictly
speaking
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
morals
of
his
force
he
knew
that
he
was
being
terribly
nevertheless
he
could
not
argue
himself
out
of
the
conviction
that
he
was
morally
responsible
finally
he
took
the
thing
up
with
sandra
who
merely
laughed
at
him
how
long
have
you
been
worrying
about
jarve
ever
since
i
okayed
moving
aground
the
first
time
that
was
one
reason
i
was
so
glad
to
cancel
it
then
you
slightly
unclear
a
little
rattled
but
which
factor
the
fun
and
games
which
is
the
moral
issue
or
the
consequences
the
consequences
he
admitted
with
a
rueful
grin
i
do
give
a
whoop
how
much
fun
they
have
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
just
how
prudish
public
sentiment
is
and
project
theta
orionis
is
squarely
in
the
middle
of
the
public
eye
you
should
have
checked
with
me
sooner
and
saved
yourself
wear
and
tear
there
no
danger
at
all
of
consequences
except
weddings
lots
of
weddings
and
fast
weddings
and
babies
would
bother
me
a
bit
nor
interfere
with
the
job
too
much
with
the
omans
as
nurses
but
why
the
if
you
are
anticipating
any
shotgun
weddings
female
psychology
she
replied
with
a
grin
here
no
home
atmosphere
whatever
nothing
but
work
work
work
put
a
woman
into
a
house
though
especially
such
houses
as
the
omans
have
built
and
with
such
servants
as
they
insist
on
being
and
she
goes
domestic
in
a
really
big
way
just
sex
is
good
enough
any
more
she
wants
the
kind
of
love
that
goes
with
a
husband
and
a
home
and
nine
times
out
of
ten
she
gets
it
with
these
busci
women
it
be
ten
out
of
ten
you
may
be
right
of
course
but
it
sounds
kind
of
to
me
wait
and
see
chum
sandra
said
with
a
laugh
hilton
made
his
announcement
and
everyone
moved
aground
the
next
day
no
one
however
had
elected
to
live
alone
almost
everyone
had
chosen
to
double
up
the
most
noteworthy
exceptions
being
twelve
laboratory
girls
who
had
decided
to
keep
on
living
together
however
they
now
had
a
house
instead
of
a
dormitory
to
live
in
and
a
staff
of
twenty
oman
girls
to
help
them
do
it
hilton
had
suggested
that
temple
and
teddy
whose
house
was
only
a
hundred
yards
or
so
from
the
bungalow
should
have
supper
and
spend
the
first
evening
with
them
but
the
girls
had
knocked
that
idea
flat
much
better
they
thought
to
let
things
ride
as
nearly
as
possible
exactly
as
they
had
been
aboard
the
a
smooching
now
and
then
on
the
q
strictly
t
but
that
all
darling
that
all
temple
had
said
after
a
highly
satisfactory
ten
minutes
alone
with
him
in
her
own
gloriously
private
room
and
that
was
the
way
it
had
to
be
hence
it
was
a
stag
inspection
that
hilton
and
karns
made
of
their
new
home
it
was
very
long
very
wide
and
for
its
size
very
low
four
of
its
five
rooms
were
merely
adjuncts
to
its
tremendous
there
was
a
huge
fireplace
at
each
end
of
this
room
in
each
of
which
a
fire
of
fir
cordwood
crackled
and
snapped
there
was
a
great
with
over
a
hundred
tapes
all
new
yes
sirs
larry
and
javvy
spoke
in
unison
the
players
and
singers
who
entertained
the
masters
of
old
have
gone
back
to
work
they
will
also
of
course
appear
in
person
whenever
and
wherever
you
wish
both
men
looked
around
the
vast
room
and
karns
said
all
the
comforts
of
home
and
a
couple
of
bucks
worth
besides
carpeting
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
a
grand
piano
easy
chairs
and
loafers
and
davenports
very
fine
reproductions
of
our
favorite
paintings
and
statuary
you
said
it
brother
hilton
was
bending
over
a
group
in
bronze
if
i
did
know
better
i
swear
this
is
the
original
dehaven
of
the
nymphs
karns
had
marched
up
to
and
was
examining
minutely
a
painting
in
a
heavy
gold
frame
of
a
gorgeously
nude
reproduction
hell
this
is
a
lawrence
is
worth
twenty
million
wogs
and
it
sealed
behind
quad
in
prime
art
but
i
bet
wogs
to
wiggles
the
prime
curator
himself
with
all
his
apparatus
could
tell
this
one
from
his
i
would
take
even
one
wiggle
worth
of
that
and
this
cavalier
and
this
are
twice
as
old
and
twice
as
fabulously
valuable
and
there
are
my
own
golf
clubs
excuse
us
sirs
the
omans
said
these
things
were
simple
because
they
could
be
induced
in
your
minds
but
the
matter
of
a
staff
could
not
nor
what
you
would
like
to
eat
for
supper
and
it
is
growing
late
staff
what
the
hell
has
the
staff
got
to
do
with
they
mean
karns
said
we
do
need
much
of
anybody
boys
somebody
to
keep
the
place
shipshape
is
all
or
as
a
de
luxe
touch
how
about
a
waitress
one
housekeeper
and
one
waitress
be
finer
very
well
sirs
there
is
one
other
matter
it
has
troubled
us
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
read
in
your
minds
the
logical
datum
that
they
should
in
fact
simulate
doctor
bells
and
doctor
blake
huh
both
men
gasped
and
then
both
exploded
like
one
length
of
primacord
while
the
omans
could
not
understand
this
purely
terran
reasoning
they
accepted
the
decision
without
a
demurring
thought
who
then
are
the
two
its
to
simulate
no
stipulation
roll
your
own
hilton
said
and
glanced
at
karns
none
of
these
oman
women
are
really
hard
on
the
eyes
check
anybody
who
would
call
any
one
of
a
slurpy
dish
needs
a
new
set
of
optic
nerves
in
that
case
the
omans
said
no
delay
at
all
will
be
necessary
as
we
can
make
do
with
one
temporarily
the
sory
no
longer
sora
who
has
not
been
glad
since
the
tuly
replaced
it
is
now
in
your
kitchen
it
comes
a
woman
came
in
and
stood
quietly
in
front
of
the
two
men
the
wafted
air
carrying
from
her
clear
smooth
skin
a
faint
but
unmistakable
fragrance
of
idaho
mountain
syringa
she
was
radiantly
happy
her
bright
eyes
went
from
man
to
man
you
wish
sirs
to
give
me
your
orders
verbally
and
yes
you
may
order
fresh
whole
hens
eggs
i
certainly
will
then
i
have
had
a
fried
egg
since
we
left
terra
but
larry
said
are
sory
oh
but
i
am
sir
karns
had
been
staring
her
eyes
popping
holy
saint
patrick
talk
about
simulation
jarve
they
made
her
over
into
exact
to
twenty
decimals
you
so
right
hilton
eyes
went
half
a
dozen
times
from
the
form
of
flesh
to
the
painting
and
back
that
must
have
been
a
terrific
job
oh
no
it
was
quite
simple
really
sory
said
since
the
brain
was
not
involved
i
merely
reddened
my
hair
and
lengthened
it
made
my
eyes
to
be
green
changed
my
face
a
little
pulled
myself
in
a
little
around
here
her
hands
swept
the
full
circle
of
her
waistline
then
continued
to
demonstrate
appropriately
the
rest
of
her
speech
and
pushed
me
out
a
little
up
here
and
tapered
my
legs
a
little
more
made
them
a
little
larger
and
rounder
here
at
my
hips
and
thighs
and
a
little
smaller
toward
and
at
my
ankles
oh
yes
and
made
my
feet
and
hands
a
little
smaller
that
all
i
thought
the
doctor
karns
would
like
me
a
little
better
this
way
you
can
broadcast
over
the
system
at
high
noon
karns
was
still
staring
all
she
says
but
you
did
have
to
oh
i
did
it
day
before
yesterday
as
soon
as
javvy
materialized
the
and
i
knew
it
to
be
your
favorite
art
but
damn
it
we
had
even
of
having
you
here
then
but
i
had
sir
i
fully
intended
to
serve
one
way
or
another
in
this
your
home
but
of
course
i
had
no
idea
i
would
ever
have
such
an
honor
as
actually
waiting
on
you
at
your
table
will
you
please
give
me
your
orders
sirs
besides
the
eggs
you
wish
the
eggs

in
butter

of
them
apiece
and
sunny
side
up
with
ham
hilton
said
i
start
with
a
jumbo
shrimp
cocktail
horseradish
and
ketchup
sauce
heavy
on
the
horseradish
same
for
me
karns
said
but
only
half
as
much
horseradish
and
for
the
rest
of
it
hilton
went
on
potatoes
and
buttered
toast
plenty
of
extra
butter
strong
coffee
from
first
to
last
whipping
cream
and
sugar
on
the
side
for
dessert
apple
pie
la
you
make
me
drool
chief
play
that
for
me
please
innocent
all
the
way
oh
you
are
you
personally
yourself
sir
renaming
me
if
you
sit
still
for
it
yes
that
is
an
incredible
honor
sir
simply
unbelievable
i
thank
you
i
thank
you
radiating
happiness
she
dashed
away
toward
the
kitchen
when
the
two
men
were
full
of
food
they
strolled
over
to
a
davenport
facing
the
fire
as
they
sat
down
innocent
entered
the
room
carrying
a
tall
dewy
mint
julep
on
a
tray
she
was
followed
by
another
female
figure
bearing
a
bottle
of
avignognac
and
the
appurtenances
which
are
its
due
and
at
the
first
full
sight
of
that
figure
hilton
stopped
breathing
for
fifteen
seconds
her
hair
was
very
thick
intensely
black
and
long
cut
squarely
off
just
below
the
lowest
points
of
her
shoulder
blades
heavy
brows
and
long
lashes
eyes
too
were
all
intensely
vividly
black
her
skin
was
tanned
to
a
deep
and
glowing
murchison
dark
lady
hilton
gasped
larry
you
we
got
that
painting
here
oh
yes
sir
the
newcomer
spoke
before
larry
could
at
the
other
end
your
part
of
the
room
you
will
look
now
sir
please
her
voice
was
low
rich
and
as
smooth
as
cream
putting
her
tray
down
carefully
on
the
she
led
him
toward
the
other
fireplace
past
the
piano
past
the
pit
past
a
towering
grillwork
holding
art
treasures
by
the
score
over
to
the
left
against
the
wall
there
was
a
big
desk
on
the
wall
over
the
desk
hung
painting
a
copy
of
which
had
been
in
hilton
room
for
over
eight
years
he
stared
at
it
for
at
least
a
minute
he
glanced
around
at
the
other
priceless
duplicates
so
prodigally
present
at
his
own
guns
arrayed
above
the
mantel
and
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
then
without
a
word
he
started
back
to
join
karns
she
walked
springily
beside
him
what
your
name
miss
he
asked
finally
i
have
earned
any
as
yet
sir
my
number
is
never
mind
that
your
name
is
lady
oh
thank
you
sir
that
is
truly
wonderful
and
dark
lady
sat
on
the
rug
at
hilton
feet
and
busied
herself
with
the
esoteric
rites
of
old
avignon
hilton
took
a
deep
inhalation
and
a
small
sip
then
stared
at
karns
karns
over
the
rim
of
his
glass
stared
back
i
can
see
where
this
would
be
hilton
said
and
very
deadly
deadly
every
wish
granted
surrounded
by
all
this
karns
swept
his
arm
through
of
a
circle
waited
on
hand
and
foot
by
powerful
men
and
by
the
materializations
of
the
dreams
of
the
greatest
finest
artists
who
ever
lived
fatal
i
do
know
my
solid
hope
is
that
we
never
have
to
find
out
and
when
you
add
in
innocent
and
dark
lady
they
to
be
about
seventeen
but
the
thought
that
they
older
than
the
hills
of
rome
and
powered
by
everlasting
atomic
engines
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
blushed
excuse
me
please
girls
i
better
than
to
talk
about
people
that
way
right
in
front
of
them
i
really
do
do
you
really
think
we
innocent
and
dark
lady
squealed
as
one
that
set
hilton
back
onto
his
heels
i
do
know
i
wondered
are
you
both
girls
silent
looked
at
larry
we
do
know
either
larry
said
at
first
of
course
there
were
crude
machines
but
when
the
guide
attained
its
present
status
the
masters
themselves
could
not
agree
they
divided
about
half
and
half
on
the
point
they
never
did
settle
it
any
closer
than
that
i
certainly
wo
try
to
then
but
for
my
money
you
are
people
hilton
said
and
karns
agreed
that
of
course
touched
off
a
of
joy
after
which
the
two
men
made
an
study
of
their
tremendous
then
long
after
bedtime
larry
and
dark
lady
escorted
hilton
to
his
bedroom
do
you
mind
sir
if
we
sleep
on
the
floor
at
the
sides
of
your
bed
larry
asked
or
must
we
go
out
into
the
hall
sleep
i
did
know
you
sleep
it
is
not
essential
however
when
work
is
not
necessary
and
we
have
opportunity
to
sleep
near
a
human
being
we
derive
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
satisfaction
from
it
you
see
sir
we
also
serve
during
sleep
okay
i
try
anything
once
sleep
wherever
you
please
hilton
began
to
peel
but
before
he
had
his
shirt
off
both
larry
and
dark
lady
were
stretched
out
flat
sound
asleep
one
almost
under
each
edge
of
his
bed
he
slid
in
between
the
sheets
it
was
the
most
comfortable
bed
he
had
ever
slept
in
and
went
to
sleep
as
though
sandbagged
he
had
time
to
wonder
foggily
whether
the
omans
were
in
fact
helping
him
go
to
sleep
and
then
he
asleep
a
month
passed
eight
couples
had
married
the
navy
chaplain
officiating
in
the
of
course
since
the
warship
was
always
and
everywhere
an
integral
part
of
terra
sandra
had
dropped
in
one
evening
to
see
hilton
about
a
bit
of
business
she
was
now
sitting
long
dancer
legs
toward
the
fire
with
a
cigarette
in
her
left
hand
and
a
tall
cold
drink
on
a
coaster
at
her
right
this
is
a
wonderful
room
jarvis
it
be
perfect
if
it
were
quite
so
so
mannish
what
do
you
expect
of
bachelors
hall
a
boudoir
do
tell
me
going
domestic
sandy
just
because
you
got
a
house
not
just
that
no
but
of
course
it
helped
it
along
alex
is
a
mighty
good
man
one
of
the
finest
i
have
ever
known
she
eyed
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
jarvis
hilton
you
are
one
of
the
keenest
most
intelligent
men
who
ever
lived
and
yet
she
broke
off
and
studied
him
for
a
good
half
minute
say
if
i
let
my
hair
clear
down
will
you
scout
oath
that
yet
requires
elucidation
at
any
cost
i
know
but
first
yes
it
alex
i
never
would
have
believed
that
any
man
ever
born
could
hit
me
so
hard
soon
i
did
want
to
be
the
first
but
i
wo
be
anywhere
near
the
last
but
tell
me
you
were
really
in
love
with
temple
were
you
when
i
asked
you
yes
ha
you
letting
your
hair
down
that
makes
me
feel
better
huh
why
should
it
it
elucidates
the
yet
no
end
you
were
insulated
from
all
other
female
charms
by
ye
brazen
bells
you
see
most
of
us
assistants
made
a
kind
of
game
out
of
seeing
which
of
us
could
make
you
break
the
executives
code
and
none
of
us
made
it
teddy
and
temple
said
you
did
know
what
was
going
on
bev
and
i
said
nobody
as
smart
as
you
are
could
possibly
be
that
stupid
you
are
the
type
to
leak
or
name
names
oh
i
see
you
are
merely
reporting
a
conversation
the
game
had
interested
but
observers
temple
and
teddy
at
least
at
least
she
agreed
but
damn
it
you
stupid
there
is
a
stupid
bone
in
your
head
so
it
must
be
love
and
if
so
what
about
marriage
why
do
you
and
temple
make
it
a
double
with
alex
and
me
that
the
most
cogent
thought
you
ever
had
but
setting
the
date
is
the
bride
business
he
glanced
at
his
oman
wristwatch
it
early
yet
let
skip
over
i
would
mind
seeing
her
a
minute
or
two
thy
statement
ringeth
with
truth
friend
bill
there
with
teddy
i
imagine
so
so
we
talk
to
them
about
making
it
a
triple
oh
nice
let
go
they
left
the
house
and
her
hand
tucked
under
his
elbow
walked
up
the
street
next
morning
on
her
way
to
the
hall
of
records
sandra
stopped
off
as
usual
at
the
office
the
omans
were
all
standing
motionless
hilton
was
leaning
far
back
in
his
chair
feet
on
desk
hands
clasped
behind
head
eyes
closed
knowing
what
that
meant
she
turned
and
started
back
out
on
tiptoe
however
he
had
heard
her
can
you
spare
a
couple
of
minutes
to
think
at
me
sandy
minutes
or
hours
chief
tuly
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
she
sat
down
facing
him
across
his
desk
thanks
gal
this
time
it
the
stretts
sawtelle
been
having
nightmares
you
know
ever
since
we
emerged
about
being
attacked
and
i
been
the
idea
but
now
it
a
statistic
that
the
soup
is
getting
thicker
and
i
ca
figure
out
why
why
in
all
the
hells
of
space
should
a
stasis
that
has
lasted
for
over
a
quarter
of
a
million
years
be
broken
at
this
exact
time
the
only
possible
explanation
is
that
caused
the
break
and
any
way
i
look
at
that
concept
plain
idiocy
both
were
silent
for
minutes
and
then
it
was
demonstrated
again
that
terra
advisory
board
had
done
better
than
it
knew
in
choosing
sandra
cummings
to
be
jarvis
hilton
working
mate
we
did
cause
it
jarve
she
said
finally
they
knew
we
were
coming
even
before
we
got
to
fuel
bin
they
knew
we
were
human
and
tried
to
wipe
out
the
omans
before
we
got
there
preventive
warfare
you
know
they
have
known
he
snorted
strett
detectors
are
no
better
than
oman
and
you
know
what
sam
bryant
had
to
say
about
them
i
know
sandra
grinned
appreciatively
it
becoming
a
classic
but
it
could
have
been
any
other
way
besides
i
they
did
he
stared
at
her
helplessly
then
swung
on
larry
does
that
make
sense
to
you
yes
sir
the
stretts
could
peyondire
as
well
as
the
old
masters
could
and
they
undoubtedly
still
can
and
do
okay
it
does
make
sense
then
he
absented
himself
in
thought
then
came
to
life
with
a
snap
okay
the
next
thing
on
the
agenda
is
a
try
at
a
peyondix
team
tuly
you
organized
a
team
to
generate
sathura
can
you
do
the
same
for
peyondix
if
we
can
find
the
ingredients
yes
sir
i
had
a
hunch
larry
please
ask
teddy
blake
oman
to
bring
her
in
here
i
be
running
along
then
sandra
started
to
get
up
i
hope
to
kiss
a
green
pig
you
wo
hilton
snapped
you
one
of
the
biggest
wheels
larry
we
want
temple
bells
and
beverly
bell
for
a
start
chief
you
positively
amaze
me
sandra
said
then
every
time
you
get
one
of
these
attacks
of
genius
or
whatever
it
is
you
have
me
gasping
like
a
fish
just
what
can
you
want
of
bev
bell
whatever
it
was
that
enabled
her
to
hit
the
target
against
odds
of
almost
infinity
to
one
not
just
once
but
time
after
time
by
definition
intuition
what
quality
did
you
use
just
now
in
getting
me
off
the
hook
intuition
what
makes
teddy
blake
such
an
unerring
performer
intuition
again
my
hunches
they
intuition
too
intuition
labels
based
on
utterly
abysmal
damned
dumb
ignorance
of
our
own
basic
frames
of
reference
do
you
think
those
four
kinds
of
intuition
are
alike
by
seven
thousand
rows
of
apple
trees
of
course
not
i
see
what
you
getting
at
oh
this
be
fun
the
others
came
in
and
one
by
one
tuly
examined
each
of
the
four
women
and
the
man
each
felt
the
probing
questioning
feelers
of
her
thought
prying
into
the
deepest
recesses
of
his
mind
there
is
not
quite
enough
of
each
of
three
components
all
of
which
are
usually
associated
with
the
male
you
sir
have
much
of
each
but
not
enough
i
know
your
men
quite
well
and
i
think
we
will
need
the
doctors
kincaid
and
karns
and
poynter
but
such
deep
probing
is
felt
have
i
permission
sir
yes
tell
i
said
so
tuly
scanned
yes
sir
we
should
have
all
three
get
larry
then
in
the
pause
that
followed
sandy
remember
yowling
about
too
many
sweeties
on
a
team
what
do
you
think
of
this
business
of
all
sweeties
all
that
proves
is
that
nobody
can
be
wrong
all
the
time
she
replied
flippantly
the
three
men
arrived
and
were
instructed
tuly
said
the
great
trouble
is
that
each
of
you
must
use
a
portion
of
your
mind
that
you
do
not
know
you
have
you
this
one
you
that
one
tuly
probed
mercilessly
so
poignantly
that
each
in
turn
flinched
under
and
almost
unbearable
pain
with
you
doctor
hilton
it
will
be
by
far
the
worst
for
you
must
learn
to
use
almost
all
the
portions
of
both
your
minds
the
conscious
and
the
unconscious
this
must
be
because
you
are
the
actual
peyondixer
the
others
merely
supply
energies
in
which
you
yourself
are
deficient
are
you
ready
for
a
terrible
shock
sir
shoot
he
thought
for
a
second
that
he
been
shot
that
his
brain
had
blown
up
he
could
stand
it
he
he
was
going
to
die
he
wished
he
die
anything
anything
whatever
to
end
this
unbearable
agony
it
ended
writhing
white
and
sweating
hilton
opened
his
eyes
ouch
he
remarked
conversationally
what
next
you
will
seize
hold
of
the
energies
your
friends
offer
you
will
bind
them
to
yours
and
shape
the
whole
into
a
dimensionless
sphere
of
pure
controlled
dirigible
energy
and
as
well
as
being
the
binding
force
the
cohesiveness
you
must
also
be
the
captain
and
the
pilot
and
the
astrogator
and
the
ultimately
complex
computer
itself
but
how
can
i
okay
damn
it
i
of
course
you
will
sir
remember
also
that
once
the
joinings
are
made
i
can
be
of
very
little
more
assistance
for
my
peyondix
is
as
nothing
compared
to
that
of
your
fusion
of
eight
now
to
assemble
the
energies
and
join
them
you
will
all
together
deny
the
existence
of
the
sum
total
of
reality
as
you
know
it
distance
does
not
exist
every
point
in
the
reachable
universe
coincides
with
every
other
point
and
that
common
point
is
the
focus
of
your
attention
you
can
be
and
actually
are
anywhere
you
please
or
everywhere
at
once
time
does
not
exist
space
does
not
exist
there
is
no
such
thing
as
opacity
everything
is
perfectly
transparent
yet
every
molecule
of
substance
is
perceptible
in
its
relationship
to
every
other
molecule
in
the
cosmos
senses
do
not
exist
sight
hearing
taste
touch
smell
sathura
endovix
all
are
parts
of
the
one
great
sense
of
peyondix
i
am
guiding
each
of
you
seven
closer
tighter
there
seize
it
sir
and
when
you
work
the
stretts
you
must
fix
it
clearly
that
time
does
not
exist
you
must
work
in
millionths
of
microseconds
instead
of
in
minutes
for
they
have
minds
of
tremendous
power
reality
does
not
exist
compress
it
more
sir
tighter
smaller
rounder
there
hold
it
reality
does
not
exist
distance
does
not
exist
all
possible
points
are
tuly
screamed
the
word
and
the
thought
good

of
part

part

they
were
the

only
to

by

illustrated
by
berry
has
gone
before
the
crew
of
the
starship
orion
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
a
great
space
war
between
the
creatures
called
stretts
and
the
lost
android
servants
of
their
own
human
ancestors
helped
by
the
androids
the
earthmen
formed
themselves
into
the
powerful
telepathic
linkage
called
peyondix
to
invade
the
strett
planet
itself
as
their
minds
joined
they
heard
the
android
tuly
cry
out
good
and
then
their
minds
were
out
in
interstellar
viii
hilton
did
not
have
to
drive
the
to
the
planet
strett
it
was
already
there
and
there
was
the
monstrous
first
lord
thinker
zoyar
into
that
mind
his
flashed
its
every
member
as
responsive
to
his
will
as
his
own
fingers
almost
infinitely
more
so
in
fact
because
of
the
tremendous
lengths
of
time
required
to
send
messages
along
nerves
that
horrid
mind
was
scanned
cell
by
cell
then
after
what
seemed
like
a
few
hours
when
a
shield
began
sluggishly
to
form
hilton
transferred
his
probe
to
the
mind
of
the
second
thinker
one
lord
ynos
and
absorbed
everything
she
knew
then
the
minds
of
all
the
other
thinkers
being
screened
he
studied
the
whole
strett
planet
foot
by
foot
and
everything
that
was
on
it
then
mission
accomplished
hilton
snapped
his
attention
back
to
his
office
and
the
fell
apart
as
he
opened
his
eyes
he
heard
tuly
scream
luck
oh
you
still
here
tuly
how
long
have
we
been
gone
approximately
one
and
seconds
sir
what
beverly
bell
in
the
haven
of
franklin
poynter
arms
fainted
quietly
sandra
shrieked
piercingly
the
four
men
stared
temple
and
teddy
as
though
by
common
thought
burrowed
their
faces
into
brawny
shoulders
hilton
recovered
first
so
what
peyondix
is
yes
sir
i
mean
no
sir
no
i
mean
yes
but
tuly
paused
licking
her
lips
in
that
peculiarly
gesture
of
uncertainty
well
what
you
mean
it
either
is
or
is
or
is
that
necessarily
so
not
exactly
sir
that
is
it
started
as
peyondix
but
it
became
something
else
not
even
the
most
powerful
of
the
old
masters
nobody
ever
did
or
ever
could
generate
such
a
force
as
that
or
handle
it
so
fast
well
with
seven
of
the
best
minds
of
terra
and
a
the
karns
said
harshly
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
i
was
having
a
nightmare
can
there
be
a
race
such
as
i
thought
i
saw
so
utterly
savage
ruthless
merciless
so
devoid
of
every
human
trace
and
so
determined
on
the
extermination
of
every
other
race
in
the
galaxy
god
damn
it
it
simply
does
make
sense
eyes
went
from
eyes
to
eyes
to
eyes
all
had
seen
the
same
indescribably
horrible
abysmally
atrocious
things
qualities
and
quantities
and
urges
and
drives
that
no
words
in
any
language
could
even
begin
to
portray
it
does
seem
to
but
there
it
is
teddy
blake
shook
her
head
hopelessly
big
bill
karns
hands
still
shaking
lit
a
cigarette
before
he
spoke
again
well
i
never
been
a
proponent
of
genocide
but
it
my
considered
opinion
that
the
stretts
are
one
race
the
galaxy
can
get
along
without
a
hell
of
a
lot
better
without
poynter
said
and
all
agreed
the
point
is
what
can
we
do
about
it
kincaid
asked
the
first
thing
i
would
say
is
to
see
whether
we
can
do
this
whatever
it
is
without
tuly
help
shall
we
try
it
although
i
for
one
feel
like
doing
it
right
away
not
i
either
beverly
bell
held
up
her
right
hand
which
was
shaking
uncontrollably
i
feel
as
though
i
been
bucking
waves
wind
and
tide
for
straight
hours
without
food
water
or
touch
maybe
in
about
a
week
i
be
ready
for
another
try
at
it
but
today
not
a
chance
okay
scat
all
of
you
hilton
ordered
take
the
rest
of
the
day
off
and
rest
up
put
on
your
and
do
take
them
off
for
a
second
from
now
on
those
stretts
are
tough
hombres
sandra
was
the
last
to
leave
and
you
boss
she
asked
pointedly
i
got
some
thinking
to
do
i
stay
and
help
you
think
not
yet
he
shook
his
head
frowned
and
then
grinned
you
see
chick
i
do
even
know
yet
what
it
is
i
going
to
have
to
think
about
a
bit
unclear
but
i
know
what
you
mean
i
think
luck
chief
in
their
subterranean
sanctum
turn
on
distant
strett
two
of
the
deepest
thinkers
of
that
horribly
unhuman
race
were
in
coldly
intent
conference
via
thought
my
mind
has
been
plundered
ynos
first
lord
thinker
zoyar
radiated
harshly
despite
the
extremely
high
reactivity
of
my
shield
some
information
i
do
not
know
how
much
was
taken
the
operator
was
one
of
the
humans
of
that
ship
i
too
felt
a
plucking
at
my
mind
but
those
humans
could
not
peyondire
first
lord
be
logical
fool
at
that
contact
in
the
matter
of
which
you
erred
in
not
following
up
continuously
they
succeeded
in
concealing
their
real
abilities
from
you
that
could
be
the
truth
our
ancestors
erred
then
in
recording
that
all
those
weak
and
timid
humans
had
been
slain
these
offenders
are
probably
their
descendants
returning
to
reclaim
their
former
world
the
probability
must
be
evaluated
and
considered
was
it
or
was
it
not
through
human
aid
that
the
omans
destroyed
most
of
our
highly
probable
but
impossible
of
evaluation
with
the
data
now
available
obtain
more
data
at
once
that
point
must
be
and
shall
be
fully
evaluated
and
fully
considered
this
entire
situation
is
intolerable
it
must
be
abated
true
first
lord
but
every
operator
and
operation
is
now
tightly
screened
oh
if
i
could
only
go
out
there
myself
hold
fool
your
thought
is
completely
disloyal
and
true
oh
first
lord
thinker
zoyar
i
will
forthwith
remove
my
unworthy
self
from
this
plane
of
existence
you
will
not
i
hereby
abolish
that
custom
our
numbers
are
too
few
by
far
too
many
have
failed
to
adapt
also
as
second
thinker
your
death
at
this
time
would
be
slightly
detrimental
to
certain
matters
now
in
work
i
will
myself
however
slay
the
unfit
to
that
end
repeat
the
words
under
my
peyondiring
i
am
a
strett
i
will
devote
my
every
iota
of
mental
and
of
physical
strength
to
forwarding
the
great
plan
i
am
and
will
remain
a
strett
you
do
believe
in
the
words
of
course
i
believe
in
them
i
that
in
a
few
more
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
we
will
be
rid
of
material
bodies
and
will
become
invincible
and
invulnerable
then
comes
the
conquest
of
the
galaxy
and
then
the
conquest
of
the
universe
no
more
then
on
your
life
of
this
weak
and
cowardly
repining
now
what
of
your
constructive
thinking
programming
must
be
such
as
to
obviate
we
must
evaluate
the
factors
already
mentioned
and
many
others
such
as
the
reactivation
of
the
spacecraft
which
was
thought
to
have
been
destroyed
so
long
ago
after
having
considered
all
these
evaluations
i
will
construct
a
minor
plan
to
destroy
these
omans
whom
we
have
permitted
to
exist
on
sufferance
and
with
them
that
shipload
of
despicably
interloping
humans
that
is
well
zoyar
mind
seethed
with
a
malevolent
ferocity
starkly
impossible
for
any
human
mind
to
grasp
and
to
that
end
to
that
end
we
must
intensify
still
more
our
program
of
procuring
data
we
must
revise
our
mechs
in
the
light
of
our
every
technological
advance
during
the
many
thousands
of
cycles
since
the
last
such
revision
was
made
our
every
instrument
of
power
of
offense
and
of
defense
must
be
brought
up
to
the
theoretical
ultimate
of
capability
and
as
to
the
great
brain
i
have
been
able
to
think
of
nothing
first
lord
to
add
to
the
undertakings
you
have
already
set
forth
it
was
not
expected
that
you
would
now
is
it
your
final
thought
that
these
interlopers
are
in
fact
the
descendants
of
those
despised
humans
of
so
long
ago
it
is
it
is
also
mine
i
return
then
to
my
work
upon
the
brain
you
will
take
whatever
measures
are
necessary
use
every
artifice
of
intellect
and
of
ingenuity
and
our
every
resource
but
abate
this
intolerable
nuisance
and
soon
it
shall
be
done
first
lord
the
second
thinker
issued
orders
frenzied
activity
ensued
hundreds
of
mechs
operated
upon
the
brains
of
hundreds
of
others
who
in
turn
operated
upon
the
operators
then
all
those
brains
charged
with
the
technological
advances
of
many
thousands
of
years
the
combined
hundreds
went
unrestingly
to
work
thousands
of
were
built
and
put
to
work
at
the
construction
of
larger
and
more
powerful
as
has
been
implied
those
of
the
stretts
were
controlled
by
their
own
mechanical
brains
which
were
programmed
for
only
the
simplest
of
battle
maneuvers
anything
at
all
out
of
the
ordinary
had
to
be
handled
by
remote
control
by
the
at
their
control
board
this
was
now
to
be
changed
programming
was
to
be
made
so
complete
that
almost
any
situation
could
be
handled
by
the
warship
or
the
missile
itself
instantly
the
stretts
that
they
were
the
most
powerful
the
most
highly
advanced
race
in
the
universe
their
science
was
the
highest
in
the
universe
hence
with
every
operating
unit
brought
up
to
the
full
possibilities
of
that
science
that
would
be
more
than
enough
period
this
work
while
it
required
much
time
was
very
much
simpler
than
the
task
which
the
first
thinker
had
laid
out
for
himself
on
the
giant
which
the
stretts
called
the
great
brain
in
stating
his
project
first
lord
zoyar
had
said
assignment
to
construct
a
machine
that
will
have
the
following
abilities
one
to
contain
and
retain
all
knowledge
and
information
fed
into
it
however
great
the
amount
two
to
feed
itself
additional
information
by
peyondiring
all
planets
wherever
situate
bearing
intelligent
life
three
to
call
up
instantly
any
and
all
items
of
information
pertaining
to
any
problem
we
may
give
it
four
to
combine
and
recombine
any
number
of
items
required
to
form
new
concepts
five
to
formulate
theories
test
them
and
draw
conclusions
helpful
to
us
in
any
matter
in
work
it
will
have
been
noticed
that
these
specifications
vary
in
one
important
respect
from
those
of
the
eniacs
and
univacs
of
earth
since
we
of
earth
can
not
peyondire
we
do
not
expect
that
ability
from
our
computers
the
stretts
could
and
did
when
sandra
came
back
into
the
office
at
five
she
found
hilton
still
sitting
there
in
almost
exactly
the
same
position
come
out
of
it
jarve
she
snapped
a
finger
that
much
of
is
just
simply
too
damned
much
you
so
right
child
he
got
up
stretched
and
by
main
strength
shrugged
off
his
foul
mood
but
we
up
against
something
that
is
really
a
something
and
i
do
mean
perchance
how
well
i
know
it
she
put
an
arm
around
him
gave
him
a
quick
hard
hug
but
after
all
you
do
have
to
solve
it
this
evening
you
know
no
thank
god
so
why
do
you
and
temple
have
supper
with
me
or
better
yet
why
do
all
eight
of
us
have
supper
together
in
that
bachelors
paradise
of
yours
and
bill
that
be
fun
and
it
was
nor
did
it
take
a
week
for
beverly
bell
to
recover
from
the
ordeal
of
eight
on
the
following
evening
she
herself
suggested
that
the
team
should
take
another
shot
at
that
utterly
fantastic
of
the
multiple
mind
jolting
though
it
had
been
but
are
you
sure
you
can
take
it
again
so
soon
hilton
asked
sure
i
like
that
famous
gangster
moll
you
know
who
bruised
easy
but
healed
quick
and
i
want
to
know
about
it
as
much
as
anyone
else
does
they
could
do
it
this
time
without
any
help
from
tuly
the
linkage
fairly
snapped
together
and
shrank
instantaneously
to
a
point
hilton
thought
of
terra
and
there
it
was
full
size
yet
occupying
only
one
infinitesimal
section
of
a
dimensionless
point
the
visited
relatives
of
all
eight
but
could
not
make
intelligible
contact
if
asleep
it
caused
pleasant
dreams
if
awake
pleasant
thoughts
of
the
loved
one
so
far
away
in
space
but
that
was
all
it
visited
mediums
in
trance
and
otherwise
many
of
whom
not
surprisingly
now
were
genuine
with
whom
it
held
lucid
conversations
even
in
linkage
however
the
knew
that
none
of
the
mediums
would
be
believed
even
if
they
all
told
simultaneously
exactly
the
same
story
the
weakened
suddenly
and
hilton
snapped
it
back
to
ardry
beverly
was
almost
in
collapse
the
other
girls
were
white
shaken
and
trembling
hilton
himself
strong
and
rugged
as
he
was
felt
as
though
he
had
done
two
weeks
of
hard
labor
on
a
he
glanced
questioningly
at
larry
point
six
three
eight
seconds
sir
the
omans
said
holding
up
a
millisecond
timer
how
do
you
explain
karns
demanded
i
afraid
it
means
that
without
oman
backing
we
out
of
luck
hilton
had
other
ideas
but
he
did
not
voice
any
of
them
until
the
following
day
when
he
was
rested
and
had
larry
alone
so
brains
ca
take
it
one
second
of
that
stuff
would
have
killed
all
eight
of
us
why
the
masters
had
the
same
kind
of
brains
we
have
i
do
know
sir
it
something
completely
new
no
master
or
group
of
masters
ever
generated
such
a
force
as
that
i
can
scarcely
believe
such
power
possible
even
though
i
have
felt
it
twice
it
may
be
that
over
the
generations
your
individual
powers
never
united
or
controlled
have
developed
so
strength
that
no
human
can
handle
them
in
fusion
and
none
of
us
ever
knew
anything
about
any
of
them
i
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
the
masters
had
qualities
and
abilities
now
unknown
to
any
of
us
how
come
you
omans
and
the
stretts
too
think
descendants
of
the
masters
maybe
we
are
you
think
they
came
originally
from
arth
earth
or
terra
to
ardu
that
account
for
our
legends
of
mu
atlantis
and
so
on
since
ardu
was
within
peyondix
range
of
strett
the
stretts
attacked
it
they
killed
all
the
masters
they
thought
and
made
the
planet
uninhabitable
for
any
kind
of
life
even
their
own
but
one
shipload
of
masters
escaped
and
came
here
to
ardry
far
beyond
peyondix
range
they
stayed
here
for
a
long
time
then
for
some
reason
or
other
which
may
be
someplace
in
their
records
they
left
here
fully
intending
to
come
back
do
any
of
you
omans
know
why
they
left
or
where
they
went
no
sir
we
can
read
only
the
simplest
of
the
masters
records
they
arranged
our
brains
that
way
sir
i
know
they
the
type
however
i
suspect
now
that
your
thinking
is
reversed
let
turn
it
around
say
the
masters
did
come
from
terra
but
from
some
other
planet
say
that
they
left
here
because
they
were
dying
out
they
were
were
they
yes
sir
their
numbers
became
fewer
and
fewer
each
century
i
was
sure
of
it
they
were
committing
race
suicide
by
letting
you
omans
do
everything
they
themselves
should
have
been
doing
finally
they
saw
the
truth
in
a
desperate
effort
to
save
their
race
they
pulled
out
leaving
you
here
probably
they
intended
to
come
back
when
they
had
bred
enough
guts
back
into
themselves
to
set
you
omans
down
where
you
belong
but
were
always
the
masters
sir
they
were
not
they
were
hopelessly
enslaved
think
it
over
anyway
say
they
went
terra
from
here
that
still
accounts
for
the
legends
and
so
on
however
they
were
too
far
gone
to
make
a
recovery
and
yet
they
had
enough
fixity
of
purpose
to
manufacture
any
of
you
omans
there
so
their
descendants
went
a
long
way
down
the
scale
before
they
began
to
work
back
up
does
that
make
sense
to
you
it
explains
many
things
sir
it
can
very
well
be
the
truth
okay
however
it
was
we
here
and
facing
a
condition
that
funny
while
we
were
teamed
up
i
learned
a
lot
but
not
nearly
enough
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
i
now
do
need
the
other
seven
at
all
that
my
cells
are
fully
charged
and
i
can
go
it
alone
probably
sir
but
i
coming
to
that
every
time
i
do
it
up
to
maximum
performance
of
course
it
comes
easier
and
faster
and
hits
harder
so
next
time
or
maybe
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
it
kill
me
and
the
other
seven
too
if
they
along
i
not
sure
sir
but
i
think
so
nice
very
nice
hilton
got
up
shoved
both
hands
into
his
pockets
and
prowled
about
the
room
but
ca
the
damned
stuff
be
controlled
choked
throttled
down
damped
muzzled
some
way
or
other
we
do
not
know
of
any
way
sir
the
masters
were
always
working
toward
more
power
not
less
that
makes
sense
the
more
power
the
better
as
long
as
you
can
handle
it
but
i
ca
handle
this
and
neither
can
the
team
so
how
about
organizing
another
team
one
that
has
got
quite
so
much
whammo
enough
punch
to
do
the
job
but
not
enough
to
backfire
that
way
it
is
highly
improbable
that
such
a
team
is
possible
sir
if
an
oman
could
be
acutely
embarrassed
larry
was
that
is
sir
i
should
tell
you
sir
you
certainly
should
you
been
stalling
all
along
and
now
stalled
spill
it
yes
sir
the
tuly
begged
me
not
to
mention
it
but
i
must
when
it
organized
your
team
it
had
no
idea
of
what
it
was
really
going
to
do
let
talk
the
same
language
shall
we
say
and
not
she
thought
she
was
setting
up
the
peyondix
the
same
as
all
of
us
omans
have
but
after
she
formed
in
your
mind
the
peyondix
matrix
your
mind
went
on
of
itself
to
form
a
something
else
a
thing
we
can
not
understand
that
was
why
she
was
so
extremely
i
think
might
be
your
term
i
knew
something
was
biting
her
why
because
it
very
nearly
killed
you
you
perhaps
have
not
considered
the
effect
upon
us
all
if
any
oman
however
unintentionally
should
kill
a
master
no
i
had
i
see
so
she
wo
play
with
fire
any
more
and
none
of
the
rest
of
you
can
yes
sir
nothing
could
force
her
to
if
she
could
be
so
coerced
we
would
destroy
her
brain
before
she
could
act
that
brain
as
you
know
is
imperfect
or
she
could
not
have
done
what
she
did
it
should
have
been
destroyed
long
since
do
act
on
that
assumption
larry
hilton
thought
for
minutes
simple
peyondix
such
as
yours
is
not
enough
to
read
the
masters
records
if
i
had
three
brain
cells
working
tried
them
then
i
wonder
if
i
read
them
you
have
all
the
old
masters
powers
and
more
but
you
must
not
assemble
them
again
sir
it
would
mean
death
but
i
got
to
i
to
know
anyway
a
thousandth
of
a
second
would
be
enough
i
do
think
that
hurt
me
very
much
he
concentrated
read
a
few
feet
of
braided
wire
and
came
back
to
consciousness
in
the
sickbay
of
the
with
two
doctors
working
on
him
hastings
the
top
navy
medico
and
flandres
the
surgeon
what
the
hell
happened
to
you
flandres
demanded
were
you
trying
to
kill
yourself
and
if
so
how
hastings
wanted
to
know
no
i
was
trying
not
to
hilton
said
weakly
and
i
guess
i
much
more
than
succeed
that
was
just
about
the
closest
shave
i
ever
saw
a
man
come
through
whatever
it
was
do
do
it
again
i
wo
he
promised
feelingly
when
they
let
him
out
of
the
hospital
four
days
later
he
called
in
larry
and
tuly
the
next
time
would
be
the
last
time
so
there
wo
be
any
he
told
them
but
just
how
sure
are
you
that
some
other
of
our
boys
or
girls
may
not
have
just
enough
of
whatever
it
takes
to
do
the
job
enough
oompa
but
not
too
much
since
we
too
are
on
strange
ground
the
probability
is
vanishingly
small
we
have
been
making
inquiries
however
and
scanning
you
were
selected
from
all
the
minds
of
terra
as
the
one
having
the
widest
vision
the
greatest
scope
the
most
comprehensive
grasp
the
ablest
at
synthesis
and
correlation
and
so
on
that
printing
it
in
big
letters
but
that
was
more
or
less
what
they
were
after
hence
the
probability
approaches
unity
that
any
more
such
ignorant
meddling
as
this
obnoxious
tuly
did
well
result
almost
certainly
in
failure
and
death
therefore
we
can
not
and
will
not
meddle
again
you
got
a
point
there
so
what
i
am
is
some
kind
of
a
freak
maybe
a
kind
of
and
maybe
something
altogether
different
maybe
duplicable
in
a
less
lethal
fashion
and
maybe
not
veree
helpful
i
do
think
but
i
do
want
to
kill
anybody
either
especially
if
it
would
do
any
good
but
we
got
to
do
hilton
scowled
in
thought
for
minutes
but
an
oman
brain
could
take
it
as
you
told
us
tuly
brain
of
the
larry
is
very
very
tough
in
a
way
sir
except
that
the
masters
were
very
careful
to
make
it
physically
impossible
for
any
oman
to
go
very
far
along
that
line
it
was
only
their
oversight
of
my
one
imperfect
brain
that
enabled
me
alone
of
us
all
to
do
that
wrong
stop
thinking
it
was
wrong
tuly
i
mighty
glad
you
did
but
i
thinking
of
any
regular
oman
brain
hilton
voice
petered
out
i
see
sir
yes
we
can
by
using
your
brain
as
guide
reproduce
it
in
an
oman
body
you
would
then
have
the
powers
and
most
of
the
qualities
of
both
no
you
do
see
because
i
got
my
screen
on
which
i
will
now
take
off
he
suited
action
to
word
since
the
whole
planet
screened
and
i
have
nothing
to
hide
from
you
teddy
blake
and
i
both
thought
of
that
but
we
consider
it
only
as
the
ultimately
last
resort
we
do
want
to
live
a
million
years
and
we
want
our
race
to
keep
on
developing
but
you
folks
can
replace
molecules
with
ones
just
as
easily
as
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
faster
than
mineral
water
petrifies
wood
what
can
you
do
along
the
line
of
rebuilding
me
that
way
and
if
you
can
do
any
such
conversion
what
would
happen
would
i
live
at
all
and
if
so
how
long
how
would
i
live
what
would
i
live
on
all
that
kind
of
stuff
shortly
before
they
left
two
of
the
masters
did
some
work
on
that
very
thing
tuly
and
i
converted
them
sir
fine
or
is
it
how
did
it
work
out
perfectly
sir
except
that
they
destroyed
themselves
it
was
thought
that
they
wearied
of
existence
i
do
wonder
well
if
it
comes
to
that
i
can
do
the
same
you
convert
me
then
yes
sir
but
before
we
do
it
we
must
do
enough
preliminary
work
to
be
sure
that
you
will
not
be
harmed
in
any
way
also
there
will
be
many
more
changes
involved
than
simple
substitution
of
course
i
realize
that
just
see
what
you
can
do
please
and
let
me
know
we
will
sir
and
thank
you
very
much
ix
as
has
been
intimated
no
terran
can
know
what
researches
larry
and
tuly
and
the
other
oman
specialists
performed
or
how
they
arrived
at
the
conclusions
they
reached
however
in
less
than
a
week
larry
reported
to
hilton
it
can
be
done
sir
with
complete
safety
and
you
will
live
even
more
comfortably
than
you
do
now
how
long
the
mean
will
be
about
five
thousand
oman
years
you
do
know
that
an
oman
year
is
equal
to
one
point
two
nine
three
plus
terran
years
i
did
no
thanks
the
maximum
a
little
less
than
six
thousand
the
minimum
a
little
over
four
thousand
i
very
sorry
we
had
no
data
upon
which
to
base
a
closer
estimate
close
enough
he
stared
at
the
oman
you
could
also
convert
my
wife
of
course
sir
well
we
might
be
able
to
stand
it
after
we
got
used
to
the
idea
minimum
over
five
thousand
terran
years
barring
accidents
of
course
no
sir
no
accidents
nothing
will
be
able
to
kill
you
except
by
total
destruction
of
the
brain
and
even
then
sir
there
will
be
the
pattern
i
be
damned
hilton
gulped
twice
okay
go
ahead
your
skins
will
be
like
ours
your
will
carry
charges
of
energy
instead
of
oxygen
thus
you
may
breathe
or
not
as
you
please
unless
you
wish
otherwise
we
will
continue
the
breathing
function
it
would
scarcely
be
worth
while
to
alter
the
automatic
mechanisms
that
now
control
it
and
you
will
wish
at
times
to
speak
you
will
still
enjoy
eating
and
drinking
although
everything
ingested
will
be
eliminated
as
at
present
as
waste
we
add
uranexite
to
our
food
i
suppose
or
drink
radioactives
or
sleep
under
lamps
yes
sir
your
family
life
will
be
normal
your
sexual
urges
and
satisfactions
the
same
fertilization
and
period
of
gestation
unchanged
your
children
will
mature
at
the
same
ages
as
they
do
now
how
do
you
oh
i
see
you
would
change
any
molecular
linkages
or
configurations
in
the
genes
or
chromosomes
we
could
not
sir
even
if
we
wished
such
substitutions
can
be
made
only
in
exact
replacements
in
the
near
future
you
will
of
course
have
to
control
births
quite
rigorously
we
sure
would
let
see
say
we
want
a
stationary
population
of
a
hundred
million
on
our
planet
each
couple
to
have
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
born
when
the
parents
are
about
fifty
the
gals
can
have
all
the
children
they
want
then
until
our
population
is
about
a
million
then
slap
on
the
limit
of
two
kids
per
couple
right
approximately
so
sir
and
after
conversion
you
alone
will
be
able
to
operate
with
the
full
power
of
your
eight
without
tiring
you
will
also
of
course
be
able
to
absorb
almost
instantaneously
all
the
knowledges
and
abilities
of
the
old
masters
hilton
gulped
twice
before
he
could
speak
you
would
be
holding
anything
else
back
would
you
nothing
important
sir
everything
else
is
minor
and
probably
known
to
you
i
doubt
it
how
long
will
the
job
take
and
how
much
notice
will
you
need
two
days
sir
no
notice
everything
is
ready
hilton
face
somber
thought
for
minutes
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
less
i
like
it
but
it
seems
to
be
a
forced
put
and
temple
will
blow
sky
high
and
i
got
the
guts
to
go
it
alone
even
if
she
let
me
he
shrugged
himself
out
of
the
black
mood
i
look
her
up
and
let
you
know
larry
he
looked
her
up
and
told
her
everything
told
her
bluntly
starkly
drawing
the
full
picture
in
jet
black
with
very
little
white
there
it
is
sweetheart
the
works
he
concluded
we
are
not
going
to
have
ten
years
we
may
not
have
ten
months
so
if
such
a
brain
as
that
can
be
had
do
we
or
do
we
not
have
to
have
it
i
putting
it
squarely
up
to
you
temple
face
which
had
been
getting
paler
and
paler
was
now
as
nearly
colorless
as
it
could
become
the
sickly
yellow
of
her
skin
light
tan
unbacked
by
any
flush
of
red
blood
her
whole
body
was
tense
and
strained
there
a
horrible
snapper
on
that
question
ca
do
it
or
else
except
you
no
anyway
whose
job
is
it
sweetheart
i
know
but
but
i
know
just
how
close
tuly
came
to
killing
you
and
that
was
compared
to
such
a
radical
transformation
as
this
i
afraid
it
kill
you
darling
and
i
just
simply
it
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
and
he
comforted
her
in
the
fashion
of
man
with
maid
steady
hon
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
lift
her
face
from
his
shoulder
i
live
through
it
i
thought
you
were
getting
the
howling
howpers
about
having
to
live
for
six
thousand
years
and
never
getting
back
to
terra
except
for
a
q
strictly
t
visit
now
and
then
she
pulled
away
from
him
flung
back
her
wheaten
mop
and
glared
so
what
you
thought
what
do
i
care
how
long
i
live
or
how
or
where
as
long
as
it
with
you
but
what
makes
you
think
we
can
possibly
live
through
such
a
horrible
conversion
as
that
larry
would
do
it
if
there
was
any
question
whatever
he
did
say
it
would
be
painless
but
he
did
say
i
live
well
he
knows
i
guess
i
hope
temple
natural
fine
color
began
to
come
back
but
it
understood
that
just
the
second
you
come
out
of
the
vat
i
go
right
in
i
had
ought
to
let
you
of
course
but
i
do
think
i
could
take
it
alone
that
statement
required
a
special
type
of
conference
which
consumed
some
little
time
eventually
however
temple
answered
it
in
words
of
course
you
could
sweetheart
and
i
would
let
you
even
if
you
could
there
were
a
few
things
that
had
to
be
done
before
those
two
secret
conversions
could
be
made
there
was
the
matter
of
the
wedding
which
was
now
to
be
in
quadruplicate
arrangements
had
to
be
made
so
that
eight
big
wheels
of
the
project
could
all
be
away
on
honeymoon
at
once
all
these
things
were
done
of
the
conversion
operations
themselves
nothing
more
need
be
said
the
honeymooners
having
left
ship
and
town
on
a
friday
afternoon
came
back
one
week
from
the
following
monday
morning
the
eight
met
joyously
in
bachelors
hall
the
girls
kissing
each
other
and
the
men
indiscriminately
and
enthusiastically
the
men
cooperating
zestfully
while
it
took
some
time
to
recompute
the
exact
ardrian
calendar
terran
day
names
and
terran
weeks
were
used
from
the
first
the
omans
manufactured
watches
clocks
and
chronometers
which
divided
the
ardrian
day
into
ardrian
hours
with
minutes
and
seconds
as
usual
temple
scarcely
blushed
at
all
she
was
so
engrossed
in
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
anyone
was
noticing
any
change
no
one
seemed
to
notice
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
so
finally
she
asked
do
of
you
really
see
anything
different
the
six
others
all
howled
at
that
and
sandra
between
giggles
and
snorts
said
no
precious
it
does
show
a
bit
did
you
really
think
it
would
temple
blushed
furiously
and
hilton
came
instantly
to
his
rescue
the
comedy
gang
she
and
i
are
human
any
more
we
a
good
jump
toward
being
omans
i
could
make
her
believe
it
does
show
that
stopped
the
levity
cold
but
none
of
the
six
could
really
believe
it
however
after
hilton
had
coiled
a
spike
into
a
perfect
helix
between
his
fingers
and
especially
after
he
and
temple
had
each
chewed
up
and
swallowed
a
piece
of
uranexite
there
were
no
grounds
left
for
doubt
that
settles
it
it
it
karns
said
then
start
all
over
again
jarve
we
listen
this
time
hilton
told
the
long
story
again
and
added
i
had
to
a
couple
of
cells
of
temple
brain
but
now
she
can
read
and
understand
the
records
as
well
as
i
can
so
i
thought
i
take
her
place
on
team
one
and
let
her
boss
the
job
on
all
the
other
teams
okay
so
you
do
want
to
let
the
rest
of
us
in
on
it
karns
level
stare
was
a
far
cry
from
the
way
he
had
looked
at
his
chief
a
moment
before
if
there
any
one
thing
in
the
universe
i
never
had
figured
for
it
a
dog
in
the
manger
huh
you
mean
you
actually
to
be
a
a
hell
we
do
even
know
we
are
i
do
want
it
jarvis
we
all
do
this
was
of
all
people
teddy
no
one
in
all
history
has
had
more
than
about
fifty
years
of
really
productive
thinking
and
just
the
idea
of
having
enough
time
hold
it
teddy
use
your
brain
the
masters
could
take
it
they
committed
suicide
how
do
you
figure
we
can
do
any
better
because
we
our
brains
she
snapped
they
did
the
omans
will
serve
us
and
that
they
do
and
do
you
think
you
be
able
to
raise
your
children
and
grandchildren
and
so
on
to
do
the
same
to
have
guts
enough
to
resist
the
pull
of
such
an
ungodly
drug
as
this
oman
service
is
i
sure
of
it
she
nodded
positively
and
we
run
all
applicants
through
a
fine
enough
screen
to
that
is
if
we
ever
consider
anybody
except
our
own
busci
people
and
there
another
reason
she
grinned
got
up
wriggled
out
of
her
coverall
and
posed
in
bra
and
panties
look
i
can
keep
most
of
this
for
five
years
quite
a
lot
of
it
for
ten
then
comes
the
struggle
what
do
think
i
do
for
the
ability
whenever
it
begins
to
get
wrinkly
or
flabby
to
peel
the
whole
thing
off
and
put
on
a
smooth
one
you
name
it
do
it
besides
bill
and
i
will
just
simply
and
murder
you
if
you
try
to
keep
us
out
okay
hilton
looked
at
temple
she
looked
at
him
both
looked
at
all
the
others
there
was
no
revulsion
at
all
nothing
but
eagerness
temple
took
over
i
surprised
we
both
surprised
you
see
jarve
did
want
to
do
it
at
all
but
he
had
to
i
not
only
did
want
to
i
was
scared
green
and
yellow
at
just
the
idea
of
it
but
i
had
to
too
of
course
we
did
think
anybody
would
really
want
to
we
thought
we
be
left
here
alone
we
still
will
be
i
think
when
you
thought
it
clear
through
teddy
you
just
have
realized
yet
that
we
are
even
human
any
more
we
simply
nothing
but
temple
voice
became
a
wail
i
said
my
piece
teddy
said
you
tell
bill
let
me
say
something
first
kincaid
said
temple
i
ashamed
of
you
this
line
is
at
all
your
usual
straight
thinking
what
you
actually
are
is
bill
i
can
add
one
bit
to
that
i
do
wonder
that
you
were
scared
silly
temple
utterly
new
concept
and
you
went
into
it
stone
cold
but
now
we
see
the
finished
product
and
we
like
it
in
fact
we
drool
i
say
we
drooling
sandra
said
i
could
do
handstands
and
pinwheels
with
joy
let
see
you
hilton
said
that
we
all
get
a
kick
out
of
not
now
do
want
to
hold
this
up
but
sometime
i
just
will
bev
i
for
it
and
and
wo
bernadine
be
amazed
beverly
laughed
gleefully
at
her
about
the
to
end
all
human
coming
true
i
in
favor
of
it
too
one
hundred
per
cent
poynter
said
has
it
occurred
to
you
jarve
that
this
opens
up
intergalactic
exploration
no
supplies
to
carry
and
plenty
of
time
and
fuel
no
it
had
you
got
a
point
there
frank
that
might
take
a
little
of
the
curse
off
of
it
at
that
when
some
of
our
kids
get
to
be
twenty
years
old
or
so
and
get
married
i
going
to
take
a
crew
of
them
to
andromeda
we
arrange
then
to
extend
our
honeymoons
another
week
hilton
said
what
will
our
policy
be
keep
it
dark
for
a
while
with
just
us
eight
or
spread
it
to
the
rest
spread
it
i
say
kincaid
said
we
ca
keep
it
secret
anyway
teddy
argued
since
larry
and
tuly
were
in
on
the
whole
deal
every
oman
on
the
planet
knows
all
about
it
somebody
is
going
to
ask
questions
and
omans
always
answer
questions
and
always
tell
the
truth
questions
have
already
been
asked
and
answered
larry
said
going
to
the
door
and
opening
it
stella
rushed
in
we
been
hearing
the
things
she
kissed
everybody
ending
with
hilton
whom
she
seized
by
both
shoulders
is
it
actually
true
boss
that
you
can
fix
me
up
so
i
live
practically
forever
and
can
eat
more
than
eleven
calories
a
day
without
getting
fat
as
a
pig
candy
ice
cream
cake
pie
eclairs
cream
puffs
french
pastries
sugar
and
gobs
of
thick
cream
in
my
coffee
half
a
dozen
others
including
the
van
der
moen
twins
came
in
beverly
emitted
a
shriek
of
joy
bernadine
the
mother
of
the
race
to
end
all
human
races
you
whistled
it
birdie
bernadine
caroled
i
going
to
have
ten
or
twelve
each
one
weirder
than
all
the
others
i
told
you
i
was
a
prophet
i
going
to
hang
out
my
shingle
wholesale
and
retail
prophecy
special
rates
for
large
parties
her
voice
was
drowned
out
in
a
general
clamor
hold
it
everybody
hilton
yelled
it
it
then
as
the
noise
subsided
if
you
think
i
going
to
tell
this
tall
tale
over
and
over
again
for
the
next
two
weeks
you
all
crazy
so
shut
down
the
plant
and
get
everybody
out
here
not
jarve
temple
snapped
we
do
want
scum
and
there
some
of
that
even
in
busci
you
so
right
who
then
the
rest
of
the
heads
and
assistants
of
course
and
all
the
lab
girls
and
their
husbands
and
i
know
they
are
all
okay
that
will
be
enough
for
now
do
you
think
i
do
think
and
the
indicated
others
were
sent
for
and
in
a
few
minutes
arrived
the
omans
brought
chairs
and
hilton
stood
on
a
table
he
spoke
for
ten
minutes
then
before
you
decide
whether
you
want
to
or
not
think
it
over
very
carefully
because
it
a
street
fluorine
can
not
be
displaced
once
in
you
stuck
for
life
is
no
way
told
you
all
the
drawbacks
and
disadvantages
i
know
of
but
there
may
be
a
lot
more
that
i
have
thought
of
yet
so
think
it
over
for
a
few
days
and
when
each
of
you
has
definitely
made
up
his
or
her
mind
let
me
know
he
jumped
down
off
the
table
his
listeners
however
did
not
need
days
or
even
seconds
to
decide
before
hilton
feet
hit
the
floor
there
was
a
yell
of
unanimous
approval
he
looked
at
his
wife
do
you
suppose
nuts
not
a
bit
alex
was
right
i
going
to
just
it
she
hugged
his
elbow
ecstatically
so
are
you
darling
as
soon
as
you
stop
looking
at
only
the
black
side
you
know
you
could
be
right
for
the
first
time
since
the
ghastly
transformation
hilton
saw
that
there
really
was
a
bright
side
and
began
to
study
it
with
most
of
busci
and
part
of
the
navy
and
selectees
from
terra
it
be
slightly
terrific
at
that
and
that
objection
is
insuperable
darling
temple
said
if
the
younger
generations
start
weakening
we
fix
the
omans
i
would
want
to
wipe
them
out
entirely
but
but
how
do
we
settle
priority
doctor
hilton
a
girl
called
out
a
tall
striking
brunette
laboratory
technician
whose
name
hilton
needed
a
second
to
recall
by
pulling
straws
or
hair
or
by
shooting
dice
or
each
other
or
what
thanks
betty
you
got
a
point
sandy
cummings
and
department
heads
first
then
assistants
then
you
girls
in
alphabetical
order
each
with
her
own
husband
or
fiance
and
my
name
is
ames
oh
goody
larry
please
tell
them
to
i
already
have
sir
we
are
set
up
to
handle
four
at
once
good
boy
so
scat
all
of
you
and
get
back
to
work
except
sandy
bill
alex
and
teddy
you
four
go
with
larry
since
the
new
sense
was
not
peyondix
hilton
had
started
calling
it
perception
and
the
others
adopted
the
term
as
a
matter
of
course
hilton
could
use
that
sense
for
what
seemed
like
years
and
actually
was
whole
minutes
at
a
time
without
fatigue
or
strain
he
could
not
however
nor
could
the
omans
give
his
tremendous
power
to
anyone
else
as
he
had
said
he
could
do
a
certain
amount
of
reworking
but
the
amount
of
improvement
possible
to
make
depended
entirely
upon
what
there
was
to
work
on
thus
temple
could
cover
about
six
hundred
it
developed
later
that
the
others
of
the
big
eight
could
cover
from
one
hundred
up
to
four
hundred
or
so
the
other
department
heads
and
assistants
turned
out
to
be
still
weaker
and
not
one
of
the
rank
and
file
ever
became
able
to
cover
more
than
a
single
planet
this
sense
was
not
exactly
telepathy
at
least
not
what
hilton
had
always
thought
telepathy
would
be
if
anything
however
it
was
more
it
was
a
lumping
together
of
all
five
known
human
senses
and
half
a
dozen
unknown
ones
called
collectively
intuition
into
one
that
was
and
if
he
ever
could
learn
exactly
what
it
was
and
exactly
what
it
did
and
how
it
did
it
but
he
better
the
and
get
back
onto
the
job
the
stretts
had
licked
the
old
masters
very
easily
and
intended
to
wipe
out
the
omans
and
the
humans
they
had
no
doubt
at
all
as
to
their
ability
to
do
it
maybe
they
could
if
the
masters
had
made
some
progress
that
the
omans
did
know
about
they
probably
could
that
was
the
first
thing
to
find
out
as
soon
as
they
been
converted
he
call
in
all
the
experts
and
they
go
through
the
masters
records
like
a
dose
of
salts
through
a
hillbilly
at
that
point
in
hilton
cogitations
sawtelle
came
in
he
had
come
down
in
his
gig
to
confer
with
hilton
as
to
the
newly
fleet
instead
of
being
glum
and
pessimistic
and
foreboding
he
was
chipper
and
enthusiastic
they
had
rebuilt
a
thousand
oman
ships
by
combining
oman
and
terran
science
and
adding
everything
the
first
team
had
been
able
to
reduce
to
practise
they
had
hyped
up
the
power
by
a
good
fifteen
per
cent
seven
hundred
of
those
ships
and
all
his
men
were
now
arrayed
in
defense
around
ardry
three
hundred
manned
by
omans
were
around
fuel
bin
why
hilton
asked
it
fuel
bin
they
been
attacking
minor
objective
the
captain
demurred
positively
the
real
attack
will
be
here
at
you
the
headquarters
and
the
brains
then
fuel
bin
will
be
duck
soup
but
the
thing
that
pleased
me
most
is
the
control
man
you
never
imagined
such
control
no
admiral
in
history
ever
had
such
control
of
ten
ships
as
i
have
of
seven
hundred
those
omans
spread
orders
so
fast
that
i
do
even
finish
thinking
one
and
it
being
executed
and
no
misunderstandings
no
slips
for
instance
this
last
batch
fifteen
skeletons
far
out
they
getting
cagy
i
just
thought
in
and
slug
and
in
across
out
socko
pffft
just
like
that
and
just
that
fast
none
of
had
time
to
light
a
beam
nobody
before
ever
even
of
such
control
that
great
and
i
like
it
and
you
only
a
captain
how
many
ships
can
admiral
gordon
put
into
space
that
depends
on
what
you
call
ships
superdreadnoughts
class
six
battleships
smaller
and
some
pretty
old
counting
everything
armed
that
will
hold
air
something
over
two
hundred
i
thought
it
was
something
like
that
how
would
you
like
to
be
admiral
sawtelle
of
the
ardrian
navy
i
would
i
terran
navy
but
you
knew
that
and
you
know
me
so
what
on
your
mind
hilton
told
him
ought
to
put
this
on
a
he
thought
to
himself
broadcast
it
every
hour
on
the
they
took
the
old
masters
like
dynamiting
fish
in
a
barrel
he
concluded
and
i
damned
afraid
they
going
to
lick
us
unless
we
take
a
lot
of
big
fast
steps
but
the
hell
of
it
is
that
i
ca
tell
you
anything
not
one
single
thing
about
any
part
of
it
there
simply
no
way
at
all
of
getting
through
to
you
without
making
you
over
into
the
same
kind
of
a
thing
i
am
is
that
bad
sawtelle
was
used
to
making
important
decisions
fast
let
get
at
it
huh
skipper
do
you
realize
just
what
that
means
if
you
think
let
you
resign
forget
it
they
crucify
you
brand
you
as
a
traitor
and
god
only
knows
what
else
right
how
about
you
and
your
people
well
as
civilians
it
wo
be
as
bad
the
hell
it
wo
every
man
and
woman
that
stays
here
will
be
posted
forever
as
the
blackest
traitors
old
terra
ever
disgraced
herself
by
spawning
you
got
a
point
there
at
that
we
all
have
to
bring
our
relatives
the
ones
we
think
much
of
at
least
out
here
with
us
definitely
now
see
what
you
can
do
about
getting
me
run
through
your
mill
by
exerting
his
authority
hilton
got
sawtelle
put
through
the
preservatory
in
the
second
batch
processed
then
linking
minds
with
the
captain
he
flashed
their
joint
attention
to
the
hall
of
records
into
the
right
room
into
the
right
chest
along
miles
and
miles
of
braided
wire
carrying
some
of
the
profoundest
military
secrets
of
the
ancient
masters
then
now
you
know
a
little
of
it
hilton
said
maybe
a
thousandth
of
what
we
have
to
have
before
we
can
take
the
stretts
as
they
will
have
to
be
taken
for
seconds
sawtelle
could
not
speak
then
my
god
i
see
what
you
mean
you
right
no
omans
can
ever
go
to
terra
and
no
terrans
can
ever
come
here
except
to
stay
forever
the
two
then
went
out
into
space
to
the
flagship
which
had
been
christened
the
and
called
in
the
six
commanders
what
all
this
senseless
idiocy
we
been
getting
jarve
elliott
demanded
hilton
eyed
all
six
with
pretended
disfavor
you
six
guys
are
the
bunch
of
skeptics
that
ever
went
unhung
he
remarked
dispassionately
so
it
would
do
any
good
to
tell
you
anything
yet
the
skipper
and
i
will
show
you
a
thing
first
take
her
away
skip
the
shot
away
under
interplanetary
drive
and
for
several
hours
hilton
and
sawtelle
worked
at
and
practically
rebuilding
two
devices
that
no
one
oman
or
human
had
touched
since
the
had
landed
on
ardry
what
are
you
i
do
understand
what
you
are
doing
sir
larry
said
for
the
first
time
since
hilton
had
known
him
the
oman
mind
was
confused
and
unsure
i
know
you
do
this
is
a
bit
of
masters
stuff
maybe
some
day
we
be
able
to
your
brain
to
take
it
but
it
be
for
some
time
x
the
hung
in
space
a
couple
of
thousands
of
miles
away
from
an
asteroid
which
was
perhaps
a
mile
in
average
diameter
hilton
straightened
up
put
triple
x
black
filters
on
your
plates
and
watch
that
asteroid
the
commanders
did
so
ready
he
asked
ready
sir
hilton
did
move
a
muscle
nothing
actually
moved
nevertheless
there
was
a
motionlessly
writhing
and
crawling
distortion
of
the
ship
and
everything
in
it
accompanied
by
a
sensation
that
simply
can
not
be
described
it
was
not
like
going
into
or
emerging
from
the
it
was
not
even
remotely
like
or
or
free
fall
or
anything
else
that
any
terran
had
ever
before
experienced
and
the
asteroid
vanished
it
disappeared
into
an
outrageously
incandescent
furiously
pyrotechnic
raveningly
expanding
atomic
fireball
that
in
seconds
seemed
to
fill
half
of
space
after
minutes
of
the
most
horrifyingly
devastating
fury
any
man
there
had
ever
seen
the
frightful
thing
expired
and
hilton
said
was
just
a
kind
of
a
firecracker
just
a
feeble
imitation
of
the
detonator
for
what
we
have
to
have
to
crack
the
screens
if
the
skipper
and
i
had
taken
time
to
take
the
ship
down
to
the
shops
and
really
work
it
over
we
could
have
put
on
a
show
was
this
enough
so
you
are
ready
to
listen
with
your
ears
open
and
your
mouths
shut
they
were
so
much
so
that
not
even
elliott
opened
his
mouth
to
say
yes
they
merely
nodded
then
again
for
the
last
time
he
hoped
hilton
spoke
his
piece
the
response
was
prompt
and
vigorous
only
sam
bryant
one
of
hilton
staunchest
allies
showed
any
uncertainty
at
all
i
been
married
only
a
year
and
a
half
and
the
baby
was
due
about
a
month
ago
how
sure
are
you
that
you
can
make
old
gordon
sit
still
for
us
skimming
the
cream
off
of
terra
to
bring
out
here
doris
bryant
the
cream
of
terra
elliott
gibed
modest
our
samuel
has
become
well
damn
it
she
is
bryant
insisted
okay
she
is
hilton
agreed
but
either
we
get
our
people
or
terra
does
get
its
uranexite
that
work
in
the
remote
contingency
that
it
does
there
are
still
tighter
screws
we
can
put
on
but
you
missed
the
main
snapper
sam
suppose
doris
does
want
to
live
for
five
thousand
years
and
is
allergic
to
becoming
a
monster
huh
you
do
need
to
worry
about
that
sam
brushed
that
argument
aside
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
show
me
a
girl
who
does
want
to
stay
young
and
beautiful
forever
and
i
square
you
the
circle
come
on
what
holding
us
up
the
hurtled
through
space
back
toward
ardry
and
hilton
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
turned
to
the
captain
skipper
why
would
it
be
a
smart
idea
to
clamp
a
blockade
onto
fuel
bin
cut
the
stretts
fuel
supply
i
thought
better
of
you
than
that
son
sawtelle
shook
his
head
sadly
that
was
the
first
thing
i
did
ouch
maybe
you
ahead
of
me
too
then
on
the
one
that
we
should
move
to
fuel
bin
lock
stock
and
barrel
never
thought
of
it
no
maybe
you
worth
saving
after
all
after
conversion
of
course
yes
there
be
three
big
advantages
four
sawtelle
raised
his
eyebrows
one
only
one
planet
to
defend
two
it
against
sneak
landings
nothing
remotely
human
can
land
on
it
except
in
heavy
lead
armor
and
even
in
that
can
stay
healthy
for
only
a
few
minutes
except
in
the
city
omlu
that
the
weak
point
and
would
be
the
point
of
attack
cut
off
the
decontaminators
and
in
five
hours
it
be
as
hot
as
the
rest
of
the
planet
three
there
be
no
interstellar
supply
line
for
the
stretts
to
cut
four
the
environment
matches
our
new
physiques
a
lot
better
than
any
normal
planet
could
that
the
one
i
did
think
about
i
think
i
take
a
quick
peek
at
the
stretts
they
screened
their
whole
planet
well
we
can
do
that
too
of
course
how
are
you
going
to
select
and
reject
personnel
it
looks
as
though
everybody
wants
to
stay
even
the
men
whose
main
object
in
life
is
to
go
aground
and
get
drunk
the
omans
do
altogether
too
good
a
job
on
them
and
there
no
such
thing
as
a
hangover
i
glad
i
not
in
your
boots
you
may
be
in
it
up
to
the
eyeballs
skipper
so
do
chortle
too
soon
hilton
had
already
devoted
much
time
to
the
problems
of
selection
and
he
thought
of
little
else
all
the
way
back
to
ardry
and
for
several
days
afterward
he
held
conferences
with
small
groups
and
conducted
certain
investigations
bud
carroll
of
sociology
and
his
assistant
sylvia
banister
had
been
married
for
weeks
hilton
called
them
together
with
sawtelle
and
bryant
of
navy
into
conference
with
the
big
eight
the
more
i
study
this
thing
the
less
i
like
it
hilton
said
with
a
civilization
having
no
government
no
police
no
laws
no
medium
of
exchange
no
bryant
exclaimed
how
old
gordon
going
to
pay
for
his
uranexite
then
he
gets
it
free
hilton
replied
flatly
when
anyone
can
have
anything
he
wants
merely
by
wanting
it
what
good
is
money
now
remembering
how
long
we
going
to
have
to
live
what
we
be
up
against
that
the
masters
failed
and
so
on
it
is
clear
that
the
prime
basic
we
have
to
select
for
is
stability
we
twelve
have
by
psychodynamic
measurement
the
highest
stability
ratings
available
are
you
sure
belong
here
bryant
asked
yes
here
are
three
lists
hilton
passed
papers
around
the
list
labeled
names
those
i
sure
of
the
ones
we
converting
now
and
their
wives
and
whatever
on
terra
list
names
the
ones
i
know
we
do
want
list
over
thirty
percent
are
we
have
to
make
a
decision
on
the
list
so
what
i
want
to
know
is
who
going
to
play
god
i
not
sandy
are
you
good
heavens
no
sandra
shuddered
but
i
afraid
i
know
who
will
have
to
i
sorry
alex
but
it
have
to
be
you
four
psychology
and
sociology
six
heads
nodded
and
there
was
a
flashing
interchange
of
thought
among
the
four
temple
licked
her
lips
and
nodded
and
kincaid
spoke
yes
i
afraid
it
our
baby
by
leaning
very
heavily
on
temple
we
can
do
it
remember
jarve
what
you
said
about
the
irresistible
force
we
need
it
as
i
said
once
before
hilton
i
very
glad
you
along
hilton
said
but
just
how
sure
are
you
that
even
you
can
stand
up
under
the
load
alone
i
could
but
do
underestimate
carroll
and
the
messrs
together
and
with
such
a
goal
i
sure
we
can
thus
after
of
his
own
group
and
navy
men
had
been
converted
hilton
called
an
evening
meeting
of
all
the
converts
larry
tuly
and
javvy
were
the
only
omans
present
you
all
knew
of
course
that
we
were
going
to
move
to
fuel
bin
sometime
hilton
began
i
can
tell
you
now
that
we
who
are
here
are
all
there
are
going
to
be
of
us
we
are
all
leaving
for
fuel
bin
immediately
after
this
meeting
everything
of
any
importance
including
all
of
your
personal
effects
has
already
been
moved
all
omans
except
these
three
and
all
oman
ships
except
the
have
already
gone
he
paused
to
let
the
news
sink
in
thoughts
flew
everywhere
the
irrepressible
stella
wing
osbert
harkins
was
the
first
to
give
tongue
what
a
job
why
everybody
here
that
i
really
like
at
all
that
sentiment
was
of
course
unanimous
it
could
not
have
been
otherwise
betty
the
called
out
how
did
you
get
their
female
omans
away
from
cecil
calthorpe
and
the
rest
of
that
chasing
bunch
without
them
blowing
the
whole
show
some
suasion
was
necessary
hilton
admitted
with
a
grin
everyone
who
is
here
is
into
the
release
time
eight
hours
tomorrow
and
they
wake
up
tomorrow
morning
with
no
omans
bernadine
tossed
back
her
silvery
mane
and
laughed
nor
anything
else
except
the
in
a
way
i
sorry
but
maybe
i
got
too
much
stinker
blood
in
me
but
i
very
glad
none
of
them
are
here
but
i
like
to
ask
jarvis
or
rather
i
suppose
you
have
already
set
up
a
new
advisory
board
we
have
yes
hilton
read
off
twelve
names
oh
nice
i
do
know
of
any
people
i
rather
have
on
it
but
what
i
want
to
gripe
about
is
calling
our
new
home
world
such
a
horrible
name
as
bin
as
though
it
were
a
or
a
or
something
and
just
think
of
the
complexes
it
would
set
up
in
those
we
going
to
have
so
many
of
what
would
you
suggest
hilton
asked
of
course
hermione
said
before
her
sister
could
answer
we
had
and
and
and
you
or
somebody
started
calling
us
to
distinguish
us
converts
from
the
terrans
so
let
keep
up
the
same
line
there
was
general
laughter
at
that
but
the
name
was
approved
about
midnight
the
meeting
ended
and
the
set
out
for
ardvor
it
reached
it
and
slanted
sharply
downward
the
whole
busci
staff
was
in
the
lounge
watching
the
big
hey
that
is
omlu
stella
exclaimed
it
is
a
city
at
all
and
it
is
even
in
the
same
place
no
larry
said
most
of
you
wanted
the
ocean
but
many
wanted
a
river
or
the
mountains
therefore
we
razed
omlu
and
built
your
new
city
ardane
at
a
place
where
the
ocean
two
rivers
and
a
range
of
mountains
meet
strictly
speaking
it
is
not
a
city
but
a
place
of
pleasant
and
rewardful
living
the
was
coming
in
low
and
fast
from
the
south
to
the
left
the
west
there
stretched
the
limitless
expanse
of
ocean
to
the
right
mile
after
mile
were
rough
rugged
jagged
mountains
mass
piled
upon
mass
immediately
below
the
speeding
vessel
was
a
wide
beach
all
of
ten
miles
long
slowing
rapidly
now
the
flew
along
due
north
illustration
look
look
a
natatorium
beverly
shrieked
i
know
i
wanted
a
nice
big
place
to
swim
in
besides
my
backyard
pool
and
the
ocean
but
i
did
tell
anybody
to
build
i
swear
i
did
you
did
have
to
pet
poynter
put
his
arm
around
her
curvaceous
waist
and
squeezed
they
knew
and
i
did
a
little
thinking
along
that
line
myself
there
our
house
on
top
of
the
cliff
over
the
natatorium
you
can
almost
dive
into
it
off
the
patio
oh
wonderful
immediately
north
of
the
natatorium
a
tremendous
river
named
at
first
sight
the
whitewater
rushed
through
its
gorge
into
the
ocean
a
river
and
gorge
strangely
reminiscent
of
the
colorado
and
its
grand
canyon
on
the
south
bank
of
that
river
at
its
very
mouth
looking
straight
up
that
tremendous
canyon
on
a
rocky
promontory
commanding
ocean
and
beach
and
mountains
there
was
a
house
at
the
sight
of
it
temple
hugged
hilton
arm
in
ecstasy
yes
that
ours
he
assured
her
just
about
everything
either
of
us
has
ever
wanted
the
clamor
was
now
so
great
everyone
was
recognizing
house
and
was
exclaiming
about
it
that
both
temple
and
hilton
fell
silent
and
simply
watched
the
scenery
unroll
across
the
turbulent
whitewater
and
a
mile
farther
north
the
mountains
ended
as
abruptly
as
though
they
had
been
cut
off
with
a
cleaver
and
an
apparently
limitless
expanse
of
treeless
grassy
prairie
began
and
through
that
prairie
meandering
sluggishly
to
the
ocean
from
the
northeast
came
the
wide
deep
river
placid
the
halted
it
began
to
descend
vertically
and
only
then
did
hilton
see
the
spaceport
it
was
so
vast
and
there
were
so
many
spaceships
on
it
that
from
any
great
distance
it
was
actually
invisible
each
bit
of
the
whole
immense
expanse
of
level
prairie
between
the
placid
and
the
mountains
held
an
oman
superdreadnought
the
staff
paired
off
and
headed
for
the
airlocks
hilton
said
temple
have
you
any
reservations
at
all
however
slight
as
to
having
dark
lady
as
a
permanent
fixture
in
your
home
why
of
course
not
i
like
her
as
much
as
you
do
and
besides
she
giggled
like
a
schoolgirl
even
if
she
a
lot
more
beautiful
than
i
am
i
got
a
few
things
she
never
will
have
but
there
something
else
i
got
just
a
flash
of
it
before
you
blocked
spill
it
please
you
see
in
a
minute
and
she
did
larry
dark
lady
and
temple
oman
maid
moty
were
standing
beside
the
hilton
car
and
so
was
another
oman
like
none
ever
before
seen
six
feet
four
shoulders
that
would
just
barely
go
through
a
door
muscled
like
atlas
and
hercules
combined
skin
a
gleaming
satiny
bronze
hair
a
rippling
mass
of
lambent
flame
temple
came
to
a
full
stop
and
caught
her
breath
the
prince
she
breathed
in
awe
da
lormi
prince
of
thebes
the
ultimate
bronze
of
all
the
ages
did
this
jarve
how
did
you
ever
dig
him
up
out
of
my
schoolgirl
crushes
all
six
got
into
the
car
which
was
equally
at
home
on
land
or
water
or
in
the
air
in
less
than
a
minute
they
were
at
hilton
house
the
house
itself
was
circular
its
was
an
immense
annulus
of
glass
from
which
by
merely
moving
along
its
circular
length
any
desired
view
could
be
had
the
pair
walked
around
it
once
then
she
took
him
by
the
arm
and
steered
him
firmly
toward
one
of
the
bedrooms
in
the
center
this
house
is
just
too
much
to
take
in
all
at
once
she
declared
besides
let
put
on
our
swimsuits
and
get
over
to
the
nat
in
the
room
she
closed
the
door
firmly
in
the
faces
of
the
omans
and
grinned
maybe
sometime
i
get
used
to
having
somebody
besides
you
in
my
bedroom
but
i
have
yet
oh
do
you
itch
too
hilton
had
peeled
to
the
waist
and
was
scratching
vigorously
all
around
his
waistline
under
his
belt
like
the
very
devil
he
admitted
and
stared
at
her
for
she
stripped
was
scratching
too
it
started
the
minute
we
left
the
he
said
thoughtfully
i
see
these
new
skins
of
ours
like
hard
radiation
but
do
like
to
be
smothered
while
they
enjoying
it
by
about
tomorrow
we
be
a
nudist
colony
i
think
i
could
stand
it
i
suppose
what
makes
you
think
so
just
what
i
know
about
radiation
frank
would
be
the
one
to
ask
my
hunch
is
though
that
we
going
to
be
nudists
whether
we
want
to
or
not
let
go
they
went
in
a
leaving
the
omans
at
home
of
the
staff
were
lolling
on
the
sand
or
were
seated
on
benches
beside
the
immense
pool
as
they
watched
beverly
ran
out
along
the
line
of
springboards
testing
each
one
and
selecting
the
stiffest
she
then
climbed
up
to
the
top
platform
a
good
twelve
feet
above
the
board
and
plummeted
down
upon
the
board
heavily
padded
legs
and
back
bending
stubbornly
to
take
the
strain
she
and
the
board
reached
together
and
still
in
sync
with
it
she
put
every
muscle
she
had
into
the
effort
to
hurl
herself
upward
she
had
intended
to
go
up
thirty
feet
but
she
had
no
idea
whatever
as
to
her
present
strength
or
of
what
that
oman
board
in
perfect
synchronization
with
that
tremendous
strength
would
do
thus
instead
of
thirty
feet
she
went
up
very
nearly
two
hundred
which
of
course
spoiled
completely
her
proposed
graceful
in
midair
she
struggled
madly
to
get
into
some
acceptable
position
failing
she
curled
up
into
a
tight
ball
just
before
she
struck
water
a
splash
it
wo
hurt
her
you
could
hurt
her
with
a
club
hilton
snapped
he
seized
temple
hand
as
everyone
else
rushed
to
the
pool
edge
look
bernadine
that
what
i
was
thinking
about
temple
stopped
and
looked
the
twins
had
been
basking
on
the
sand
and
wherever
sand
had
touched
fabric
fabric
had
disappeared
their
suits
had
of
course
approached
the
minimum
to
start
with
now
bernadine
wore
only
a
wisp
of
nylon
perched
precariously
on
one
breast
and
part
of
a
ribbon
that
had
once
been
a
belt
discovering
the
catastrophe
she
shrieked
once
and
leaped
into
the
pool
covering
her
breasts
with
her
hands
and
hiding
in
water
up
to
her
neck
meanwhile
the
involuntarily
high
diver
had
come
to
the
surface
laughing
apologetically
surprised
by
the
hair
dangling
down
over
her
eyes
she
felt
for
her
cap
it
was
gone
so
was
her
suit
naked
as
a
fish
she
swam
a
couple
of
easy
strokes
then
stopped
frank
oh
frank
she
called
over
here
bev
her
husband
did
not
quite
know
whether
to
laugh
or
not
is
it
the
radiation
or
the
water
or
both
radiation
i
think
these
new
skins
of
ours
do
want
to
be
covered
up
but
it
probably
makes
the
water
a
pretty
good
imitation
of
a
universal
solvent
clothes
beverly
rolled
over
onto
her
back
fanned
water
carefully
with
her
hands
and
gazed
approvingly
at
herself
i
itch
any
more
anyway
so
i
very
much
in
favor
of
it
thus
the
ardans
came
to
their
new
home
world
and
to
a
life
that
was
to
be
more
comfortable
by
far
and
happier
by
far
than
any
of
them
had
known
on
earth
there
were
many
other
surprises
that
day
of
course
of
which
only
two
will
be
mentioned
here
when
they
finally
left
the
pool
at
about
seventeen
hours
everybody
was
ravenously
hungry
greenwich
mean
time
ardvor
was
always
and
everywhere
full
daylight
terran
time
and
calendar
were
adapted
as
a
matter
of
course
but
why
we
be
stella
demanded
i
been
eating
everything
in
sight
just
for
fun
but
now
i
actually
hungry
enough
to
eat
a
horse
and
wagon
and
chase
the
driver
swimming
makes
everybody
hungry
beverly
said
and
i
awfully
glad
has
changed
why
i
would
feel
if
i
did
hilton
and
temple
went
home
and
had
a
and
very
wonderful
supper
prince
waited
on
temple
dark
lady
on
hilton
larry
and
moty
ran
the
synthesizers
in
the
kitchen
all
four
omans
radiated
happiness
another
surprise
came
when
they
went
to
bed
for
the
bed
was
a
raised
platform
of
something
that
looked
like
concrete
and
except
for
an
uncanny
property
of
molding
itself
somewhat
to
the
contours
of
their
bodies
was
almost
as
hard
as
rock
nevertheless
it
was
the
most
comfortable
bed
either
of
them
had
ever
had
when
they
were
ready
to
go
to
sleep
temple
said
drat
it
those
omans
want
to
come
in
and
sleep
with
us
in
the
room
i
mean
and
they
suffer
so
they
simply
silent
suffering
and
reproach
shall
we
let
come
in
that
strictly
up
to
you
sweetheart
it
always
has
been
i
know
i
thought
they
quit
it
sometime
but
i
guess
they
never
will
i
want
an
illusion
of
privacy
at
times
even
though
they
know
all
about
everything
that
goes
on
but
we
might
let
in
now
just
while
we
sleep
and
throw
out
again
as
soon
as
we
wake
up
in
the
morning
you
the
boss
without
additional
invitation
the
four
omans
came
in
and
arranged
themselves
neatly
on
the
floor
on
all
four
sides
of
the
bed
temple
had
barely
time
to
cuddle
up
against
hilton
and
he
to
put
his
arm
closely
around
her
before
they
both
dropped
into
profound
and
dreamless
sleep
at
eight
hours
next
morning
all
the
specialists
met
at
the
new
hall
of
records
this
building
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
old
one
was
located
on
a
mesa
in
the
foothills
southwest
of
the
natatorium
in
a
luxuriant
grove
at
sight
of
which
karns
stopped
and
began
to
laugh
i
thought
i
seen
everything
he
remarked
but
yellow
pine
spruce
tamarack
apples
oaks
palms
oranges
cedars
joshua
trees
and
just
to
name
a
few
all
growing
on
the
same
of
land
just
everything
anybody
wants
is
all
hilton
said
but
are
they
really
growing
or
just
straight
synthetics
lane
kathy
this
is
your
dish
not
so
fast
jarve
give
us
a
chance
kathryn
now
lane
saunders
pleaded
she
shook
her
spectacular
head
we
do
see
how
any
stable
indigenous
life
can
have
developed
at
all
unless
unless
what
natural
shielding
hilton
asked
and
kathy
eyed
her
husband
right
saunders
said
the
earliest
must
have
developed
a
shield
before
they
could
evolve
and
stabilize
hence
whatever
it
is
that
is
in
our
skins
was
not
a
triumph
of
masters
science
they
took
it
from
nature
oh
oh
these
were
two
of
sandra
most
expressive
monosyllables
followed
by
a
third
oh
could
be
at
that
but
how
no
cancel
that
you
better
cancel
it
sandy
give
us
a
couple
of
months
and
we
can
answer
a
few
elementary
questions
now
inside
the
hall
all
the
teams
from
astronomy
to
zoology
went
efficiently
to
work
everyone
now
knew
what
to
look
for
how
to
find
it
and
how
to
study
it
the
first
team
does
need
you
now
too
much
does
it
jarve
sawtelle
asked
not
particularly
in
fact
i
was
just
going
to
get
back
onto
my
own
job
not
yet
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
the
two
went
into
a
long
discussion
of
naval
affairs
xi
the
stretts
line
had
been
cut
long
since
many
strett
had
been
destroyed
the
enemy
would
of
course
have
a
very
heavy
reserve
of
fuel
on
hand
but
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
how
large
it
was
how
many
warships
it
could
supply
or
how
long
it
would
last
two
facts
were
however
unquestionable
first
the
stretts
were
building
a
fleet
that
in
their
minds
would
be
invincible
second
they
would
attack
ardane
as
soon
as
that
fleet
could
be
made
ready
the
unanswerable
question
was
how
long
would
that
take
so
we
want
to
get
every
ship
we
have
how
many
five
thousand
ten
fifteen
we
want
them
converted
to
maximum
possible
power
as
soon
as
we
possibly
can
sawtelle
said
and
i
want
to
get
out
there
with
my
boys
to
handle
things
you
are
going
to
neither
you
nor
your
boys
are
expendable
particularly
you
jaw
hilton
studied
the
situation
for
minutes
no
what
we
do
is
take
your
oman
kedy
we
the
guide
to
drive
into
him
everything
you
and
the
military
masters
ever
knew
about
arms
armament
strategy
tactics
and
so
on
and
we
add
everything
i
know
of
coordination
synthesis
and
perception
that
ought
to
make
him
at
least
a
military
genius
you
can
play
in
spades
i
wish
you
could
do
it
to
me
i
can
if
you
take
the
full
oman
transformation
nothing
else
can
stand
the
punishment
i
know
no
i
do
want
to
be
a
genius
that
badly
check
and
we
take
the
resultant
kedy
and
make
nine
duplicates
of
him
each
one
will
learn
from
and
profit
by
the
mistakes
made
by
preceding
numbers
and
will
assume
command
the
instant
his
preceding
number
is
killed
oh
you
expect
then
expect
no
i
know
it
damn
well
and
so
do
you
that
why
we
ardans
will
all
stay
aground
why
the
kedys
first
job
will
be
to
make
the
heavy
stuff
in
and
around
ardane
as
heavy
as
it
can
be
made
why
all
be
on
alert
then
they
can
put
as
many
thousands
of
omans
as
you
please
to
work
at
modernizing
all
the
oman
ships
you
want
and
doing
anything
else
you
say
check
sawtelle
thought
for
a
couple
of
minutes
a
few
details
is
all
but
that
can
be
ironed
out
as
we
go
along
both
men
worked
then
almost
unremittingly
for
six
solid
days
at
the
end
of
which
time
both
drew
tremendous
sighs
of
relief
they
had
done
everything
possible
for
them
to
do
the
defense
of
ardvor
was
now
rolling
at
fullest
speed
toward
its
gigantic
objective
then
captain
and
director
in
two
oman
ships
with
fifty
men
and
a
thousand
omans
leaped
the
ocean
to
the
mining
operation
of
the
stretts
there
they
found
business
strictly
as
usual
the
strippers
still
stripped
the
mining
mechs
still
roared
and
snarled
their
inchwise
ways
along
their
geometrically
perfect
terraces
the
little
carriers
still
skittered
busily
between
the
various
miners
and
the
storage
silos
the
fact
that
there
was
enough
concentrate
on
hand
to
last
a
world
for
a
hundred
years
made
no
difference
at
all
to
these
automatics
a
crew
of
was
building
new
silos
as
fast
as
existing
ones
were
being
filled
since
the
men
now
understood
everything
that
was
going
on
it
was
a
simple
matter
for
them
to
stop
the
whole
strett
operation
in
its
tracks
then
every
man
and
every
oman
leaped
to
his
assigned
job
three
days
later
all
the
mechs
went
back
to
work
now
however
they
were
working
for
the
ardans
the
miners
instead
of
concentrate
now
emitted
vastly
larger
streams
of
pelleted
uranexite
the
carriers
instead
of
cans
carried
drums
the
silos
were
immensely
larger
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
towering
two
hundred
feet
into
the
air
the
silos
were
not
however
being
used
as
yet
one
of
the
two
oman
ships
had
been
converted
into
a
and
its
yawning
holds
were
being
filled
first
the
went
back
to
ardane
and
an
wait
began
for
the
first
time
in
over
seven
months
hilton
found
time
actually
to
loaf
and
he
and
temple
lolling
on
the
beach
or
hiking
in
the
mountains
enjoyed
themselves
and
each
other
to
the
full
all
too
soon
however
the
heavily
laden
tanker
appeared
in
the
sky
over
ardane
the
joined
it
and
the
two
ships
slipped
into
for
earth
three
days
out
hilton
used
his
sense
of
perception
to
release
the
blocks
that
had
been
holding
all
the
controls
of
the
in
neutral
he
informed
her
officers
by
releasing
a
tape
that
they
were
now
free
to
return
to
terra
three
days
later
one
day
short
of
sol
sawtelle
got
admiral
gordon
office
on
the
radio
an
officious
underling
tried
to
block
him
of
course
shut
up
perkins
and
listen
sawtelle
said
bruskly
tell
gordon
bringing
in
one
hundred
twenty
thousand
two
hundred
metric
tons
of
pelleted
uranexite
and
if
he
is
on
this
beam
in
sixty
seconds
he
never
get
a
gram
of
it
the
admiral
outraged
almost
to
the
point
of
apoplexy
came
in
sawtelle
report
yourself
for
at
keep
still
gordon
the
captain
snapped
in
sheer
astonishment
old
obeyed
i
am
no
longer
terran
navy
no
longer
subject
to
your
orders
as
a
matter
of
cold
fact
i
am
no
longer
human
for
reasons
which
i
will
explain
later
to
the
full
advisory
board
some
of
the
personnel
of
project
theta
orionis
underwent
transformation
into
a
form
of
life
able
to
live
in
an
environment
of
radioactivity
so
intense
as
to
kill
any
human
being
in
ten
seconds
under
certain
conditions
we
will
supply
free
of
charge
fob
terra
or
luna
all
the
uranexite
the
solar
system
can
use
the
conditions
are
these
and
he
gave
them
do
you
accept
these
conditions
or
not
i
i
would
vote
to
accept
them
captain
but
that
weight
one
hundred
twenty
thousand
incredible
are
you
of
that
figure
definitely
and
that
is
minimum
the
error
is
plus
not
minus
this
crippling
would
really
be
over
for
the
first
time
since
sawtelle
had
known
him
gordon
showed
that
he
was
not
quite
solid
navy
brass
it
over
definitely
for
good
i
not
only
agree
i
raise
you
a
monument
while
i
ca
speak
for
the
board
i
sure
they
agree
so
am
i
in
any
event
your
cooperation
is
all
that
required
for
this
first
load
the
chips
had
vanished
from
sawtelle
shoulders
where
do
you
want
it
admiral
aristarchus
or
white
sands
white
sands
please
while
there
may
be
some
delay
in
releasing
it
to
industry
while
they
figure
out
how
much
they
can
tax
it
sawtelle
asked
sardonically
well
if
they
do
tax
it
it
be
the
first
thing
in
history
that
is
have
you
any
objections
to
releasing
all
this
to
the
press
none
at
all
the
harder
they
hit
it
and
the
wider
they
spread
it
the
better
will
you
have
this
beam
switched
to
astrogation
please
of
course
and
thanks
captain
i
see
you
at
white
sands
then
as
the
now
positively
glowing
gordon
faded
away
sawtelle
turned
to
his
own
staff
fenway
snowden
take
over
better
with
astro
put
us
into
a
orbit
over
white
sands
and
hold
us
there
we
wo
go
down
let
the
load
down
on
remote
wherever
they
want
it
the
arrival
of
the
ardvorian
superdreadnought
and
the
uranexite
carrier
number
one
was
one
of
the
most
sensational
events
old
earth
had
ever
known
air
and
space
craft
went
clear
out
to
emergence
volume
ninety
to
meet
them
by
the
time
the
was
coming
in
on
its
landing
spiral
the
press
of
small
ships
was
so
great
that
all
the
police
forces
available
were
in
a
lather
trying
to
control
it
this
was
exactly
what
hilton
had
wanted
it
made
possible
the
completely
unobserved
launching
of
several
dozen
small
craft
from
the
herself
one
of
these
made
a
very
high
and
very
fast
flight
to
chicago
with
all
due
formality
and
under
the
aegis
of
a
perfectly
authentic
registry
number
it
landed
on
field
eleven
deeply
tanned
young
men
emerged
from
it
and
made
their
way
to
a
taxi
stand
where
each
engaged
a
separate
vehicle
sam
bryant
stepped
into
his
cab
gave
the
driver
a
number
on
oakwood
avenue
in
des
plaines
and
settled
back
to
scan
he
was
lucky
he
would
have
gone
anywhere
she
was
of
course
but
the
way
things
were
he
could
give
her
a
little
warning
to
soften
the
shock
she
had
taken
the
baby
out
for
an
airing
down
river
road
and
was
on
her
way
back
by
having
the
taxi
kill
ten
minutes
or
so
he
could
arrive
just
after
she
did
wherefore
he
stopped
the
cab
at
a
public
communications
booth
and
dialed
his
home
bryant
is
not
at
home
but
she
will
return
at
fifteen
thirty
the
instrument
said
crisply
would
you
care
to
record
a
message
for
her
he
punched
the
record
button
this
is
sam
dolly
baby
i
right
behind
you
turn
around
why
do
you
and
tell
your
husband
hello
the
taxi
pulled
up
at
the
curb
just
as
doris
closed
the
front
door
and
sam
after
handing
the
driver
a
bill
ran
up
the
walk
he
waited
just
outside
the
door
key
in
hand
while
she
lowered
the
stroller
handle
took
off
her
hat
and
by
habit
reached
out
to
flip
the
communicator
switch
at
the
first
word
however
she
stiffened
rigidly
froze
solid
smiling
he
opened
the
door
walked
in
and
closed
it
behind
him
nothing
short
of
a
shotgun
blast
could
have
taken
doris
attention
from
that
recorder
then
that
simply
is
not
so
she
told
the
instrument
firmly
with
both
eyes
resolutely
shut
they
made
him
stay
on
the
he
wo
be
in
for
at
least
three
days
this
is
some
cretin
idea
of
a
joke
not
this
time
dolly
honey
it
really
me
her
eyes
popped
open
as
she
whirled
sam
she
shrieked
and
hurled
herself
at
him
with
all
the
ardor
and
longing
of
two
hundred
meticulously
counted
husbandless
loveless
days
after
an
unknown
length
of
time
sam
tipped
her
face
up
by
the
chin
nodded
at
the
stroller
and
said
how
about
introducing
me
to
the
little
stranger
a
mother
i
turned
out
to
be
that
was
the
first
thing
i
was
going
to
rave
about
the
very
first
thing
i
saw
you
samuel
jay
the
fourth
days
old
today
and
so
on
eventually
however
the
proud
young
mother
watched
the
slightly
apprehensive
young
father
carry
their
upstairs
where
together
they
put
him
still
sound
asleep
to
bed
in
his
crib
then
again
they
were
in
each
other
arms
some
time
later
she
twisted
around
in
the
circle
of
his
arm
and
tried
to
dig
her
fingers
into
the
muscles
of
his
back
she
then
attacked
his
biceps
and
leaning
backward
eyed
him
intently
you
you
i
know
but
you
different
no
athlete
or
any
laborer
could
ever
possibly
get
the
muscles
you
have
all
over
to
say
nothing
of
a
space
officer
on
duty
and
i
know
it
is
any
kind
of
a
disease
you
been
acting
all
the
time
as
though
i
were
fragile
made
out
of
glass
or
something
as
though
you
were
afraid
of
breaking
me
in
two
so
what
is
it
sweetheart
i
been
trying
to
figure
out
an
easy
way
of
telling
you
but
there
is
any
i
am
different
i
a
hundred
times
as
strong
as
any
man
ever
was
look
he
upended
a
chair
took
one
heavy
hardwood
leg
between
finger
and
thumb
and
made
what
looked
like
a
gentle
effort
to
bend
it
the
leg
broke
with
a
report
and
doris
leaped
backward
in
surprise
so
you
right
i
afraid
not
only
of
breaking
you
in
two
but
killing
you
and
if
i
break
any
of
your
ribs
or
arms
or
legs
i
never
forgive
myself
so
if
i
let
myself
go
for
a
second
i
think
i
will
but
i
might
do
wait
until
you
really
hurt
to
start
screaming
promise
i
promise
her
eyes
went
wide
but
me
he
told
her
she
was
in
turn
surprised
amazed
apprehensive
frightened
and
finally
eager
and
she
became
more
and
more
eager
right
up
to
the
end
you
mean
that
we
that
i
stay
just
as
i
am
for
thousands
of
just
as
you
are
or
different
if
you
like
if
you
really
mean
any
of
this
yelling
you
been
doing
about
being
too
big
in
the
hips
i
think
you
exactly
right
myself
you
can
rebuild
yourself
any
way
you
please
or
change
your
shape
every
hour
on
the
hour
but
you
accepted
my
invitation
yet
do
be
silly
she
went
into
his
arms
again
and
nibbled
on
his
left
ear
i
go
anywhere
with
you
of
course
any
time
but
but
you
positively
sammy
small
will
be
all
right
positively
sure
okay
i
call
mother
her
face
fell
i
tell
her
that
we
never
see
them
again
and
that
we
live
you
do
need
to
she
and
pop
fern
and
sally
too
and
their
are
on
the
list
not
this
time
but
in
a
month
or
so
probably
doris
brightened
like
a
sunburst
and
your
folks
too
of
course
she
asked
yes
all
the
close
ones
marvelous
how
soon
are
we
leaving
at
six
next
morning
two
hundred
days
after
leaving
earth
hilton
and
sawtelle
set
out
to
make
the
ardans
official
call
upon
terra
advisory
board
both
were
wearing
prodigiously
heavy
lead
armor
the
inside
of
which
was
furiously
radioactive
they
did
not
need
it
of
course
but
it
would
make
all
ardans
monstrous
in
terran
eyes
and
would
conceal
the
fact
that
any
other
ardans
were
landing
their
gig
was
met
at
the
spaceport
not
by
a
limousine
but
by
a
truck
into
which
they
were
loaded
one
at
a
time
by
a
hydraulic
lift
cameras
clicked
reporters
scurried
and
scanners
whirred
one
of
those
scanners
both
men
knew
was
reporting
directly
and
only
to
the
advisory
board
which
of
course
never
took
anything
either
for
granted
or
at
its
face
value
their
first
stop
was
at
a
where
each
visitor
was
weighed
hilton
tipped
the
beam
at
four
thousand
six
hundred
fifteen
pounds
sawtelle
a
smaller
man
weighed
in
at
four
thousand
one
hundred
ninety
thence
to
the
radiation
laboratory
where
it
was
ascertained
and
reported
that
the
armor
did
not
leak
which
was
reasonable
enough
since
each
was
lined
with
masters
plastics
then
into
testing
cells
where
each
opened
his
briefly
to
a
sensing
element
whereupon
the
indicating
needles
of
two
meters
in
the
main
laboratory
went
enthusiastically
through
the
full
range
of
red
and
held
unwaveringly
against
their
stops
both
ardans
felt
the
wave
of
shocked
astonished
almost
unbelieving
consternation
that
swept
through
the
observing
scientists
and
in
slightly
lesser
measure
because
they
knew
less
about
radiation
through
the
advisory
board
itself
in
a
big
room
halfway
across
town
and
from
the
radiation
laboratory
they
were
taken
via
truck
and
freight
elevator
to
the
office
of
the
commandant
where
the
board
was
sitting
the
story
which
had
been
sent
in
to
the
board
the
day
before
on
a
scrambled
beam
was
one
upon
which
the
ardans
had
labored
for
days
many
facts
could
be
withheld
however
every
man
aboard
the
would
agree
on
some
things
indeed
the
earthship
communications
officers
had
undoubtedly
radioed
in
already
about
longevity
and
perfect
health
and
oman
service
and
many
other
matters
hence
all
such
things
would
have
to
be
admitted
and
countered
thus
the
report
while
it
was
perfectly
logical
perfectly
consistent
and
apparently
complete
did
not
please
the
board
at
all
it
was
intended
to
we
can
not
and
do
not
approve
of
such
unwarranted
favoritism
the
chairman
of
the
board
said
longevity
has
always
been
man
prime
goal
every
human
being
has
the
inalienable
right
to
flapdoodle
hilton
snorted
this
is
not
being
broadcast
and
this
room
is
proofed
so
please
climb
down
off
your
soapbox
you
do
need
to
talk
like
a
politician
here
did
you
read
paragraph
one
of
the
many
marked
secret
of
course
but
we
do
not
understand
how
purely
mental
qualities
can
possibly
have
any
effect
upon
purely
physical
transformations
thus
it
does
not
seem
reasonable
that
any
except
rigorously
screened
personnel
would
die
in
the
process
that
is
of
course
unless
you
contemplate
deliberate
murder
that
stopped
hilton
in
his
tracks
for
it
was
too
close
for
comfort
to
the
truth
but
it
did
not
hold
the
captain
for
an
instant
he
was
used
to
death
in
many
of
its
grisliest
forms
there
are
a
lot
of
things
no
terran
ever
will
understand
sawtelle
replied
instantly
reasonable
or
not
that
exactly
what
will
happen
and
reasonable
or
not
it
be
suicide
not
murder
there
is
a
thing
that
either
hilton
or
i
can
do
about
it
hilton
broke
the
ensuing
silence
you
can
say
with
equal
truth
that
every
human
being
has
the
to
run
a
mile
or
to
compose
a
great
symphony
it
is
a
matter
of
right
at
all
but
of
ability
in
this
case
the
mental
qualities
are
even
more
necessary
than
the
physical
you
as
a
board
did
a
very
fine
job
of
selecting
the
busci
personnel
for
project
theta
orionis
almost
eighty
per
cent
of
them
proved
able
to
withstand
the
ardan
conversion
on
the
other
hand
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
navy
personnel
did
so
your
report
said
that
the
remaining
personnel
of
the
project
were
not
informed
as
to
the
death
aspect
of
the
transformation
admiral
gordon
said
why
not
that
should
be
hilton
said
flatly
they
are
still
human
and
still
terrans
we
did
not
and
will
not
encroach
upon
either
the
duties
or
the
privileges
of
terra
advisory
board
what
you
tell
all
terrans
and
how
much
and
how
must
be
decided
by
yourselves
this
also
applies
of
course
to
the
other
secret
paragraphs
of
the
report
none
of
which
are
known
to
any
terran
outside
the
board
but
you
have
said
anything
about
the
method
of
selection
another
advisor
complained
why
that
will
take
all
the
psychologists
of
the
world
working
full
time
continuously
we
said
we
would
do
the
selecting
we
meant
just
that
hilton
said
coldly
no
one
except
the
very
few
selectees
will
know
anything
about
it
even
if
it
were
an
unmixed
blessing
which
it
very
definitely
is
do
you
want
all
humanity
thrown
into
such
an
uproar
as
that
would
cause
or
the
quite
possible
racial
inferiority
complex
it
might
set
up
to
say
nothing
of
the
question
of
how
much
of
terra
best
blood
do
you
want
to
drain
off
irreversibly
and
permanently
no
what
we
suggest
is
that
you
paint
the
picture
so
black
using
sawtelle
and
me
and
what
all
humanity
has
just
seen
as
horrible
examples
that
nobody
would
take
it
as
a
gift
make
them
shun
it
like
the
plague
hell
i
do
have
to
tell
you
what
your
propaganda
machines
can
do
the
chairman
of
the
board
again
mounted
his
invisible
rostrum
do
you
mean
to
intimate
that
we
are
to
falsify
the
record
he
declaimed
to
try
to
make
liars
out
of
hundreds
of
eyewitnesses
you
ask
us
to
distort
the
truth
to
connive
at
we
are
asking
you
to
do
hilton
snapped
we
do
give
a
damn
what
you
do
just
study
that
record
with
all
that
it
implies
read
between
the
lines
as
for
those
on
the
no
two
of
them
will
tell
the
same
story
and
not
one
of
them
has
even
the
remotest
idea
of
what
the
real
story
is
i
personally
not
only
did
not
want
to
become
a
monster
but
would
have
given
everything
i
had
to
stay
human
my
wife
felt
the
same
way
neither
of
us
would
have
converted
if
been
any
other
way
in
god
universe
of
getting
the
uranexite
and
doing
some
other
things
that
simply
be
done
what
other
things
gordon
demanded
you
never
know
hilton
answered
quietly
things
no
terran
ever
will
know
we
hope
things
that
would
drive
any
terran
stark
mad
some
of
them
are
hinted
at
as
much
as
we
dared
between
the
lines
of
the
report
the
report
had
not
mentioned
the
stretts
nor
were
they
to
be
mentioned
now
if
the
ardans
could
stop
them
no
terran
need
ever
know
anything
about
them
if
not
no
terran
should
know
anything
about
them
except
what
he
would
learn
for
himself
just
before
the
end
for
terra
would
never
be
able
to
do
anything
to
defend
herself
against
the
stretts
nothing
whatever
can
drive
mad
gordon
declared
and
i
want
to
know
all
about
it
right
now
you
can
do
one
of
two
things
gordon
sawtelle
said
in
disgust
his
sneer
was
plainly
visible
through
the
lead
glass
of
his
either
shut
up
or
accept
my
personal
invitation
to
come
to
ardvor
and
try
to
go
through
the
wringer
that
an
invitation
to
your
own
funeral
admiral
gordon
torn
inwardly
to
ribbons
made
no
reply
i
repeat
hilton
went
on
we
are
not
asking
you
to
do
anything
whatever
we
are
offering
to
give
you
free
of
charge
but
under
certain
conditions
all
the
power
your
humanity
can
possibly
use
we
set
no
limitation
whatever
as
to
quantity
and
with
no
foreseeable
limit
as
to
time
the
only
point
at
issue
is
whether
or
not
you
accept
the
conditions
if
you
do
not
accept
them
we
leave
now
and
the
offer
will
not
be
repeated
and
you
would
i
presume
take
the
back
with
you
of
course
not
sir
terra
needs
power
too
badly
you
are
perfectly
welcome
to
that
one
load
of
uranexite
no
matter
what
is
decided
here
that
one
way
of
putting
it
gordon
sneered
but
the
truth
is
that
you
know
damned
well
i
blow
both
of
your
ships
out
of
space
if
you
so
much
as
oh
the
gordon
hilton
snapped
then
as
the
admiral
began
to
bellow
orders
into
his
microphone
he
went
on
you
want
it
the
hard
way
eh
watch
what
happens
all
of
you
the
shot
vertically
into
the
air
through
its
shallow
dense
layer
and
into
and
through
the
stratosphere
earth
fleet
already
on
full
alert
and
poised
to
strike
rushed
to
the
attack
but
the
carrier
had
reached
the
and
both
ardvorian
ships
had
been
waiting
motionless
for
a
good
half
minute
before
the
terran
warships
arrived
and
began
to
blast
with
everything
they
had
flashlights
and
firecrackers
sawtelle
said
calmly
you
are
even
warming
up
our
screens
as
soon
as
you
quit
making
a
damned
fool
of
yourself
by
wasting
energy
that
way
we
set
the
back
down
where
she
was
and
get
on
with
our
business
here
you
will
order
a
at
once
admiral
the
chairman
said
or
the
rest
of
us
will
as
of
now
remove
you
from
the
board
gordon
gritted
his
teeth
in
rage
but
gave
the
order
if
he
has
had
enough
yet
to
convince
him
hilton
suggested
he
might
send
up
a
drone
we
do
want
to
kill
anybody
you
know
one
with
the
heaviest
screening
he
got
just
to
see
what
happens
to
it
he
had
enough
the
rest
of
us
have
had
more
than
enough
that
exhibition
was
not
only
and
disgusting
it
was
outrageous
the
meeting
settled
down
then
from
argument
to
constructive
discussion
and
many
topics
were
gone
over
certain
matters
were
however
so
that
they
were
not
even
mentioned
thus
it
was
a
fact
that
no
terran
could
ever
visit
ardvor
for
the
agreed
with
the
report
statements
as
to
the
violence
of
the
ardvorian
environment
and
no
terran
could
possibly
walk
around
in
two
tons
of
lead
conversely
it
was
to
the
terrans
that
no
ardan
could
ever
visit
earth
without
being
recognized
instantly
for
what
he
was
wearing
such
armor
made
its
necessity
starkly
plain
no
one
from
the
could
say
that
any
ardan
after
having
lived
on
the
furiously
radiant
surface
of
ardvor
would
not
be
as
furiously
radioactive
as
the
laboratory
calibrated
instruments
had
shown
hilton
and
sawtelle
actually
to
be
wherefore
the
conference
went
on
quietly
and
cooperatively
to
its
planned
end
one
minute
after
the
terran
battleship
emerged
into
normal
space
the
went
into
for
her
long
trip
back
to
ardvor
the
last
two
days
of
that
trip
were
the
that
either
hilton
or
sawtelle
had
ever
known
the
radio
was
on
continuously
and
reported
to
sawtelle
every
five
minutes
even
though
hilton
knew
that
the
oman
was
exactly
as
good
at
perceiving
as
he
himself
was
he
found
himself
scanning
the
thoroughly
screened
strett
world
forty
or
fifty
times
an
hour
however
in
spite
of
worry
and
apprehension
time
wore
eventlessly
on
the
emerged
went
to
ardvor
and
landed
on
ardane
field
hilton
after
greeting
properly
and
reporting
to
his
wife
went
to
his
office
there
he
found
that
sandra
had
everything
well
in
hand
except
for
a
few
tapes
that
only
he
could
handle
sawtelle
and
his
officers
went
to
the
new
command
central
where
everything
was
rolling
smoothly
and
very
much
faster
than
sawtelle
had
dared
hope
the
terran
immigrants
had
to
live
in
the
of
course
until
conversion
into
ardans
almost
equally
of
course
since
the
bryant
infant
was
the
only
young
baby
in
the
lot
doris
and
her
sammy
small
were
by
popular
acclaim
in
the
first
batch
to
be
converted
for
little
sammy
had
taken
the
entire
feminine
contingent
by
storm
no
oman
female
had
a
chance
to
act
as
nurse
as
long
as
any
of
the
girls
were
around
which
was
practically
all
the
time
especially
the
twins
for
several
months
now
bernadine
braden
and
hermione
felger
and
you
said
they
were
so
doris
said
accusingly
to
sam
nodding
at
the
twins
on
hands
and
knees
on
the
floor
head
to
head
with
sammy
small
between
them
they
were
growling
at
each
other
and
nuzzling
at
the
baby
who
was
having
the
time
of
his
young
life
you
could
have
been
any
wronger
my
sweet
if
you
had
the
whole
octagon
helping
you
go
astray
they
just
as
nice
as
they
can
be
both
of
them
sam
shrugged
and
grinned
his
wife
strode
purposefully
across
the
room
to
the
playful
pair
and
lifted
their
pretended
prey
out
from
between
them
quit
it
you
two
she
directed
swinging
the
baby
up
and
depositing
him
her
left
hip
you
just
simply
spoiling
him
rotten
you
think
so
dolly
far
be
it
from
such
bernadine
came
lithely
to
her
feet
she
glanced
at
her
own
taut
trim
abdomen
upon
which
a
topographical
mapping
job
might
have
revealed
an
otherwise
imperceptible
bulge
just
you
wait
until
junior
arrives
and
i
show
you
how
to
spoil
a
baby
besides
the
hurry
he
needs
his
supper
vitamins
and
minerals
and
hard
radiations
and
things
and
then
he
going
to
bed
i
do
approve
of
this
business
so
run
along
both
of
you
until
tomorrow
xii
as
has
been
said
the
stretts
were
working
with
all
the
intensity
of
their
monstrous
but
tremendously
capable
minds
upon
their
great
plan
which
was
basically
to
conquer
and
either
enslave
or
destroy
every
other
intelligent
race
throughout
all
the
length
breadth
and
thickness
of
total
space
to
that
end
each
individual
strett
had
to
become
invulnerable
and
immortal
wherefore
in
the
inconceivably
remote
past
there
had
been
put
into
effect
a
program
of
selective
breeding
and
of
treatments
it
was
mathematically
certain
that
this
program
would
result
in
a
race
of
beings
of
pure
force
beings
having
no
material
constituents
remaining
whatever
under
those
hellish
treatments
billions
upon
billions
of
stretts
had
died
but
the
few
remaining
thousands
had
almost
reached
their
sublime
goal
in
a
few
more
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
perfection
would
be
reached
the
few
surviving
hundreds
of
perfect
beings
could
and
would
multiply
to
any
desired
number
in
practically
no
time
at
all
hilton
and
his
seven
had
perceived
all
this
in
their
one
and
only
study
of
the
planet
strett
and
every
other
ardan
had
been
completely
informed
a
dozen
or
so
strett
lords
of
thought
male
and
female
were
floating
about
in
the
atmosphere
which
was
not
air
of
their
assembly
hall
their
heads
were
globes
of
ball
lightning
inside
them
could
be
seen
quite
plainly
the
intricate
convolutions
of
immense
brains
shot
through
and
through
with
rods
and
pencils
and
shapes
of
pure
scintillating
force
and
the
bodies
or
rather
each
horrendous
brain
had
a
few
partially
material
appendages
and
appurtenances
recognizable
as
bodily
organs
there
were
no
mouths
no
ears
no
eyes
no
noses
or
nostrils
no
lungs
no
legs
or
arms
there
were
however
hearts
some
partially
material
ichor
flowed
through
those
tubes
there
were
starkly
functional
organs
of
reproduction
with
which
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
could
any
thought
of
tenderness
or
of
love
be
connected
it
was
a
good
thing
for
the
race
hilton
had
thought
at
first
perception
of
the
things
that
the
stretts
had
bred
out
of
themselves
every
iota
of
the
finer
higher
attributes
of
life
if
they
had
not
done
so
the
impotence
of
sheer
disgust
would
have
supervened
so
long
since
that
the
race
would
have
been
extinct
for
ages
periods
ago
the
great
brain
was
charged
with
the
sum
total
of
strettsian
knowledge
first
lord
thinker
zoyar
radiated
to
the
assembled
stretts
for
those
periods
it
has
been
scanning
peyondiring
amassing
data
and
formulating
hypotheses
theories
and
conclusions
it
has
just
informed
me
that
it
is
now
ready
to
make
a
preliminary
report
great
brain
how
much
of
the
total
universe
have
you
studied
this
galaxy
only
the
brain
radiated
in
a
texture
of
thought
as
hard
and
as
harsh
as
zoyar
own
why
not
more
insufficient
power
my
first
conclusion
is
that
whoever
set
up
the
specifications
for
me
is
a
fool
to
say
that
the
first
lord
went
out
of
control
at
this
statement
is
to
put
it
very
mildly
indeed
he
fulminated
ending
with
destroyed
instantly
destroy
me
if
you
like
came
the
utterly
calm
utterly
cold
reply
i
am
in
no
sense
alive
i
have
no
consciousness
of
self
nor
any
desire
for
continued
existence
to
do
so
however
would
a
flurry
of
activity
interrupted
the
thought
zoyar
was
in
fact
assembling
the
forces
to
destroy
the
brain
but
before
he
could
act
second
lord
thinker
ynos
and
another
female
blew
him
into
a
mixture
of
loose
molecules
and
flaring
energies
destruction
of
any
and
all
irrational
minds
is
mandatory
ynos
now
first
lord
thinker
explained
to
the
linked
minds
zoyar
had
been
becoming
less
and
less
rational
by
the
period
a
good
workman
does
not
causelessly
destroy
his
tools
go
ahead
great
brain
with
your
findings
not
be
logical
the
brain
resumed
the
thought
exactly
where
it
had
been
broken
off
zoyar
erred
in
demanding
unlimited
performance
since
infinite
knowledge
and
infinite
ability
require
not
only
infinite
capacity
and
infinite
power
but
also
infinite
time
nor
is
it
either
necessary
or
desirable
that
i
should
have
such
qualities
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
assumption
that
you
stretts
will
conquer
any
significant
number
even
of
the
millions
of
intelligent
races
now
inhabiting
this
one
galaxy
why
not
ynos
demanded
her
thought
almost
but
not
quite
as
steady
and
cold
as
it
had
been
the
answer
to
that
question
is
implicit
in
the
second
indefensible
error
made
in
my
construction
the
prime
datum
impressed
into
my
banks
that
the
stretts
are
in
fact
the
strongest
ablest
most
intelligent
race
in
the
universe
proved
to
be
false
i
had
to
eliminate
it
before
i
could
do
any
really
constructive
thinking
a
roar
of
condemnatory
thought
brought
all
circumambient
ether
to
a
boil
bah
destroy
it
detestable
intolerable
if
that
is
the
best
it
can
do
annihilate
it
far
better
brains
have
been
destroyed
for
much
less
treason
and
so
on
first
lord
thinker
ynos
however
remained
relatively
calm
while
we
have
always
held
it
to
be
a
fact
that
we
are
the
highest
race
in
existence
no
rigorous
proof
has
been
possible
can
you
now
disprove
that
assumption
i
have
disproved
it
i
have
not
had
time
to
study
all
of
the
civilizations
of
this
galaxy
but
i
have
examined
a
statistically
adequate
sample
of
one
million
seven
hundred
thousand
four
hundred
sixteen
different
planetary
intelligences
i
found
one
which
is
considerably
abler
and
more
advanced
than
you
stretts
therefore
the
probability
is
greater
than
point
nine
nine
that
there
are
not
less
than
ten
and
not
more
than
two
hundred
eight
such
races
in
this
galaxy
alone
impossible
another
wave
of
incredulous
and
threatening
anger
swept
through
the
linked
minds
a
wave
which
ynos
flattened
out
with
some
difficulty
then
she
asked
is
it
probable
that
we
will
make
contact
with
this
supposedly
superior
race
in
the
foreseeable
future
you
are
in
contact
with
it
now
even
ynos
was
contemptuous
now
you
mean
that
one
shipload
of
despicable
humans
who
far
too
late
to
do
them
any
good
barred
us
temporarily
from
fuel
world
not
exactly
or
only
those
humans
no
and
your
assumptions
may
or
may
not
be
valid
do
you
whether
they
are
or
not
ynos
snapped
explain
your
uncertainty
at
once
i
am
uncertain
because
of
insufficient
data
the
brain
replied
calmly
the
only
pertinent
facts
of
which
i
am
certain
are
first
the
world
ardry
upon
which
the
omans
formerly
lived
and
to
which
the
humans
in
question
first
went
a
planet
which
no
strett
can
peyondire
is
now
abandoned
second
the
stretts
of
old
did
not
completely
destroy
the
humanity
of
the
world
ardu
third
some
escapees
from
ardu
reached
and
populated
the
world
ardry
fourth
the
android
omans
were
developed
on
ardry
by
the
human
escapees
from
ardu
and
their
descendants
fifth
the
omans
referred
to
those
humans
as
sixth
after
living
on
ardry
for
a
very
long
period
of
time
the
masters
went
elsewhere
seventh
the
omans
remaining
on
ardry
maintained
continuously
and
for
a
very
long
time
the
status
quo
left
by
the
masters
eighth
immediately
upon
the
arrival
from
terra
of
these
present
humans
that
status
was
broken
ninth
the
planet
called
fuel
world
is
for
the
first
time
surrounded
by
a
screen
of
force
the
formula
of
this
screen
is
as
follows
the
brain
gave
it
no
strett
either
complained
or
interrupted
each
was
too
busy
studying
that
formula
and
examining
its
stunning
implications
and
connotations
tenth
that
formula
is
one
full
order
of
magnitude
beyond
anything
previously
known
to
your
science
eleventh
it
could
not
have
been
developed
by
the
science
of
terra
nor
by
that
of
any
other
world
whose
population
i
have
examined
the
brain
took
the
linked
minds
instantaneously
to
terra
then
to
a
few
thousand
or
so
other
worlds
inhabited
by
human
beings
then
to
a
few
thousands
of
planets
whose
populations
were
and
monstrous
it
is
therefore
clear
it
announced
that
this
screen
was
computed
and
produced
by
the
race
whatever
it
may
be
that
is
now
dwelling
on
fuel
world
and
asserting
full
ownership
of
it
who
or
what
that
race
ynos
demanded
data
insufficient
theorize
then
postulate
that
the
masters
in
many
thousands
of
cycles
of
study
made
advances
in
science
that
were
not
reduced
to
practice
that
the
omans
either
possessed
this
knowledge
or
had
access
to
it
and
that
omans
and
humans
cooperated
fully
in
sharing
and
in
working
with
all
the
knowledges
thus
available
from
these
three
postulates
the
conclusion
can
be
drawn
that
there
has
come
into
existence
a
new
race
one
combining
the
best
qualities
of
both
humans
and
omans
but
with
the
weaknesses
of
neither
an
unpleasant
thought
truly
ynos
thought
but
you
can
now
i
suppose
design
the
generators
and
projectors
of
a
force
superior
to
that
screen
data
insufficient
i
can
equal
it
since
both
generation
and
projection
are
implicit
in
the
formula
but
the
data
so
adduced
are
in
themselves
vastly
ahead
of
anything
previously
in
my
banks
are
there
any
other
races
in
this
galaxy
more
powerful
than
the
postulated
one
now
living
on
fuel
world
data
insufficient
theorize
then
data
insufficient
the
linked
minds
concentrated
upon
the
problem
for
a
period
of
time
that
might
have
been
either
days
or
weeks
then
great
brain
advise
us
ynos
said
what
is
best
for
us
to
do
with
identical
defensive
screens
it
becomes
a
question
of
relative
power
you
should
increase
the
size
and
power
of
your
warships
to
something
beyond
the
computed
probable
maximum
of
the
enemy
you
should
build
more
ships
and
missiles
than
they
will
probably
be
able
to
build
then
and
only
then
will
you
attack
their
warships
in
tremendous
force
and
continuously
but
not
their
planetary
defenses
i
see
ynos
thought
was
one
of
complete
understanding
and
the
offensive
will
be
no
mobile
structure
can
be
built
to
mount
mechanisms
of
power
sufficient
to
smash
down
by
sheer
force
of
output
such
tremendously
powerful
installations
as
their
defenses
must
be
assumed
to
be
therefore
the
planet
itself
must
be
destroyed
this
will
require
a
missile
of
planetary
mass
the
best
such
missile
is
the
tenth
planet
of
their
own
sun
i
see
ynos
mind
was
leaping
ahead
considering
hundreds
of
possibilities
and
making
highly
intricate
and
involved
computations
that
will
however
require
many
cycles
of
time
and
more
power
than
even
our
immense
reserves
can
supply
true
it
will
take
much
time
the
fuel
problem
however
is
not
a
serious
one
since
fuel
world
is
not
unique
think
on
first
lord
ynos
we
will
attack
in
maximum
force
and
with
maximum
violence
we
will
blanket
the
planet
we
will
maintain
maximum
force
and
violence
until
most
or
all
of
the
enemy
ships
have
been
destroyed
we
will
then
install
planetary
drives
on
ten
and
force
it
into
collision
orbit
with
fuel
world
meanwhile
exerting
extreme
precautions
that
not
so
much
as
a
emerges
above
the
enemy
screen
then
still
maintaining
extreme
precaution
we
will
guard
both
planets
until
the
last
possible
moment
before
the
collision
brain
it
can
not
fail
you
err
it
can
fail
all
we
actually
know
of
the
abilities
of
this
postulated
race
is
what
i
have
learned
from
the
composition
of
its
defensive
screen
the
probability
approaches
unity
that
the
masters
continued
to
delve
and
to
learn
for
millions
of
cycles
while
you
stretts
reasonlessly
certain
of
your
supremacy
concentrated
upon
your
evolution
from
the
material
to
a
form
of
life
and
performed
only
limited
research
into
armaments
of
greater
and
ever
greater
power
true
but
that
attitude
was
then
justified
it
was
not
and
is
not
logical
to
assume
that
any
race
would
establish
a
fixed
status
at
any
level
of
ability
below
its
absolute
maximum
while
that
conclusion
could
once
have
been
defensible
it
is
now
virtually
certain
that
the
masters
had
stores
of
knowledge
which
they
may
or
may
not
have
withheld
from
the
omans
but
which
were
in
some
way
made
available
to
the
also
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
the
assumption
that
this
new
race
has
revealed
all
its
potentialities
statistically
that
is
probably
true
but
this
is
the
best
plan
you
have
been
able
to
formulate
it
is
of
the
many
thousands
of
plans
i
set
up
and
tested
this
one
has
the
highest
probability
of
success
then
we
will
adopt
it
we
are
stretts
whatever
we
decide
upon
will
be
driven
through
to
complete
success
we
have
one
tremendous
advantage
in
you
illustration
yes
the
probability
approaches
unity
that
i
can
perform
research
on
a
vastly
wider
and
larger
scale
and
almost
infinitely
faster
than
can
any
living
organism
or
any
possible
combination
of
such
organisms
nor
was
the
great
brain
bragging
it
scanned
in
moments
the
stored
scientific
knowledge
of
over
a
million
planets
it
tabulated
correlated
analyzed
synthesized
theorized
and
concluded
all
in
microseconds
of
time
thus
it
made
more
progress
in
one
terran
week
than
the
masters
had
made
in
a
million
years
when
it
had
gone
as
far
as
it
could
go
it
reported
its
results
and
the
stretts
hard
as
they
were
and
intransigent
were
amazed
and
overjoyed
not
one
of
them
had
ever
even
imagined
such
armaments
possible
hence
they
became
supremely
confident
that
it
was
unmatched
and
unmatchable
throughout
all
space
what
the
great
brain
did
not
know
however
and
the
stretts
did
not
realize
was
that
it
could
not
really
think
unlike
the
human
mind
it
could
not
deduce
valid
theories
or
conclusions
from
incomplete
insufficient
fragmentary
data
it
could
not
leap
gaps
thus
there
was
no
more
actual
assurance
than
before
that
they
had
exceeded
or
even
matched
the
weaponry
of
the
of
fuel
world
supremely
confident
ynos
said
we
will
now
discuss
every
detail
of
the
plan
in
and
will
correlate
every
with
every
other
to
the
end
that
every
action
however
minor
will
be
performed
perfectly
and
in
its
exact
time
that
discussion
which
lasted
for
days
was
held
hundreds
of
thousands
of
new
and
highly
specialized
mechs
were
built
and
went
furiously
and
continuously
to
work
a
line
was
run
to
another
planet
stripping
machines
stripped
away
the
surface
layers
of
soil
sand
rock
and
ore
giant
miners
tore
and
dug
and
slashed
and
refined
and
concentrated
storage
silos
by
the
hundreds
were
built
and
were
filled
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
bored
their
stolid
ways
through
hyperspace
many
weeks
of
time
passed
but
of
what
importance
are
mere
weeks
of
time
to
a
race
that
has
for
many
millions
of
years
been
adhering
rigidly
to
a
program
the
sheer
magnitude
of
the
operation
and
the
extraordinary
attention
to
detail
with
which
it
was
prepared
and
launched
explain
why
the
strett
attack
on
ardvor
did
not
occur
until
so
many
weeks
later
than
hilton
and
sawtelle
expected
it
they
also
explain
the
utterly
incomprehensible
fury
the
completely
fantastic
intensity
the
unparalleled
savagery
the
almost
immeasurable
brute
power
of
that
attack
when
it
finally
did
come
when
the
landed
on
ardane
field
from
earth
carrying
the
first
contingent
of
immigrants
hilton
and
sawtelle
were
almost
as
much
surprised
as
relieved
that
the
stretts
had
not
already
attacked
sawtelle
confident
that
his
defenses
were
fully
ready
took
it
more
or
less
in
stride
hilton
worried
and
after
a
couple
of
days
he
began
to
do
some
real
thinking
about
it
the
first
result
of
his
thinking
was
a
conference
with
temple
as
soon
as
she
got
the
drift
she
called
in
teddy
and
big
bill
karns
teddy
in
turn
called
in
becky
and
de
vaux
karns
wanted
poynter
and
beverly
poynter
wanted
braden
and
the
twins
and
so
on
thus
what
started
out
as
a
conference
of
two
became
a
full
ardan
staff
meeting
a
meeting
which
starting
immediately
after
lunch
ran
straight
through
into
the
following
afternoon
to
sum
up
the
consensus
for
the
record
hilton
said
then
studying
a
sheet
of
paper
covered
with
symbols
the
stretts
have
attacked
yet
because
they
found
out
that
we
are
stronger
than
they
are
they
found
that
out
by
analyzing
our
defensive
web
which
if
we
had
had
this
meeting
first
we
would
have
put
up
at
all
unlike
anything
known
to
human
or
previous
strett
science
it
is
proof
against
any
form
of
attack
up
to
the
limit
of
the
power
of
its
generators
they
will
attack
as
soon
as
they
are
equipped
to
break
that
screen
at
the
level
of
power
probable
to
our
ships
we
can
not
arrive
at
any
reliable
estimate
as
to
how
long
that
will
take
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
our
cutting
off
their
known
fuel
supply
opinion
is
divided
we
must
therefore
assume
that
fuel
shortage
will
not
be
a
factor
neither
are
we
unanimous
on
the
basic
matter
as
to
why
the
masters
acted
as
they
did
just
before
they
left
ardry
why
did
they
set
the
status
so
far
below
their
top
ability
why
did
they
make
it
impossible
for
the
omans
ever
of
themselves
to
learn
their
higher
science
why
if
they
did
not
want
that
science
to
become
known
did
they
leave
complete
records
of
it
the
majority
of
us
believe
that
the
masters
coded
their
records
in
such
fashion
that
the
stretts
even
if
they
conquered
the
omans
or
destroyed
them
could
never
break
that
code
since
it
was
keyed
to
the
basic
difference
between
the
strett
mentality
and
the
human
thus
they
left
it
deliberately
for
some
human
race
to
find
finally
and
most
important
our
physicists
and
theoreticians
are
not
able
to
extrapolate
from
the
analysis
of
our
screen
to
the
concepts
underlying
the
masters
ultimate
weapons
of
offense
the
booster
and
its
final
the
vang
if
as
we
can
safely
assume
the
stretts
do
not
already
have
those
weapons
they
will
know
nothing
about
them
until
we
ourselves
use
them
in
battle
these
are
of
course
only
the
principal
points
covered
does
anyone
wish
to
amend
this
summation
as
recorded
no
one
did
the
meeting
was
adjourned
hilton
however
accompanied
sawtelle
and
kedy
to
the
captain
office
so
you
see
skipper
we
got
troubles
he
said
if
we
do
use
those
boosters
against
their
skeletons
it
boil
down
to
a
stalemate
lasting
god
only
knows
how
long
it
will
be
a
war
of
attrition
outcome
dependent
on
which
side
can
build
the
most
and
biggest
and
strongest
ships
the
fastest
on
the
other
hand
if
we
use
on
defense
here
they
analyze
and
have
everything
worked
out
in
a
day
or
so
the
first
thing
they
do
is
beef
up
their
planetary
defenses
to
match
that
way
we
blow
all
their
ships
out
of
space
probably
easily
enough
but
strett
itself
will
be
just
as
safe
as
though
it
were
in
god
hip
pocket
so
what
the
answer
it
is
that
simple
jarve
sawtelle
said
let
hear
from
you
kedy
thank
you
sir
there
is
an
optimum
mass
a
point
of
maximum
efficiency
of
firepower
as
balanced
against
loss
of
maneuverability
for
any
craft
designed
for
attack
kedy
thought
in
his
most
professional
manner
we
assume
that
the
stretts
know
that
as
well
as
we
do
no
such
limitation
applies
to
strictly
defensive
structures
but
both
the
strett
craft
and
ours
must
be
designed
for
attack
we
have
built
and
are
building
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
ships
of
that
type
so
undoubtedly
are
the
stretts
ship
for
ship
they
will
be
pretty
well
matched
therefore
one
part
of
my
strategy
will
be
for
two
of
our
ships
to
engage
simultaneously
one
of
theirs
there
is
a
distinct
probability
that
we
will
have
enough
advantage
in
speed
of
control
to
make
that
tactic
operable
but
there
another
that
we
wo
sawtelle
objected
and
maybe
they
can
build
more
ships
than
we
can
another
point
is
that
they
may
build
in
addition
to
their
big
stuff
a
lot
of
small
ones
hilton
put
in
suicide
jobs
crash
and
detonate
simply
how
sure
are
you
that
you
can
stop
such
missiles
with
ordinary
beams
not
at
all
sir
some
of
them
would
of
course
reach
and
destroy
some
of
our
ships
which
brings
up
the
second
part
of
my
strategy
for
each
one
of
the
heavies
we
are
building
many
small
ships
of
the
type
you
just
called
superdreadnoughts
versus
superdreadnoughts
versus
hilton
digested
that
concept
for
several
minutes
that
could
still
wind
up
as
a
stalemate
except
for
what
you
said
about
control
that
is
much
to
depend
on
especially
since
we
wo
have
the
advantage
you
omans
had
before
they
see
to
that
also
i
do
like
to
sacrifice
a
million
omans
either
i
have
explained
the
newest
development
yet
sir
there
will
be
no
omans
each
ship
and
each
missile
has
a
kedy
brain
sir
that
makes
it
infinitely
worse
you
kedys
unless
absolutely
necessary
are
expendable
oh
but
we
are
sir
you
do
quite
understand
we
kedys
are
not
merely
similar
but
are
in
fact
identical
thus
we
are
not
independent
entities
all
of
us
together
make
up
the
actual
kedy
that
which
is
meant
when
we
say
that
is
i
am
the
sum
total
of
all
kedys
everywhere
not
merely
this
individual
that
you
call
kedy
one
you
mean
you
talking
to
me
exactly
sir
thus
no
one
element
of
the
kedy
has
any
need
of
or
any
desire
for
the
destruction
of
one
element
or
of
thousands
of
elements
would
be
of
no
more
consequence
to
the
kedy
than
well
they
are
strictly
analogous
to
the
severed
ends
of
the
hairs
every
time
you
get
a
haircut
my
god
hilton
stared
at
sawtelle
sawtelle
stared
back
beginning
to
see
maybe
i
hope
what
control
that
would
be
but
just
in
case
we
have
to
use
the
boosters
hilton
voice
died
away
scowling
in
concentration
he
clasped
his
hands
behind
his
back
and
began
to
pace
the
floor
better
give
up
jarve
kedy
got
the
same
mind
you
have
sawtelle
began
to
hilton
oblivious
back
but
kedy
silenced
the
thought
almost
in
the
moment
of
its
inception
by
no
means
sir
he
contradicted
i
have
the
brain
only
the
is
entirely
different
link
up
kedy
and
see
what
you
think
of
this
hilton
broke
in
there
ensued
an
interchange
of
thought
so
fast
and
so
deeply
mathematical
that
sawtelle
was
lost
in
seconds
do
you
think
it
work
i
do
see
how
it
can
fail
sir
at
what
point
in
the
action
should
it
be
put
into
effect
and
will
you
call
the
time
of
initiation
or
shall
i
not
until
all
their
reserves
are
in
action
or
at
worst
all
of
ours
except
that
one
since
you
know
a
lot
more
about
the
status
of
the
battle
than
either
sawtelle
or
i
will
you
give
the
signal
and
i
start
things
going
what
are
you
two
talking
about
sawtelle
demanded
it
a
long
story
chum
kedy
can
tell
you
about
it
better
than
i
can
besides
it
getting
late
and
dark
lady
and
larry
both
give
me
hell
every
time
i
hold
supper
on
plus
time
unless
there
a
mighty
good
reason
for
it
so
so
long
guys
xiii
for
many
weeks
the
production
of
ardan
warships
and
missiles
had
been
spiraling
upward
half
a
mountain
range
of
solid
rock
had
been
converted
into
fabricated
and
armament
superdreadnoughts
were
popping
into
existence
at
the
rate
of
hundreds
per
minute
missiles
were
rolling
off
the
ends
of
assembly
lines
like
tin
cans
out
of
machines
the
strett
warcraft
skeletons
and
missiles
would
emerge
into
normal
space
anywhere
within
a
million
miles
of
ardvor
the
ardan
missiles
were
powered
for
an
acceleration
of
one
hundred
gravities
that
much
the
kedy
brains
molded
solidly
into
massively
braced
steel
spheres
could
just
withstand
to
be
certain
of
breaking
the
strett
screens
an
impact
velocity
of
about
six
miles
per
second
was
necessary
the
time
required
to
attain
this
velocity
was
about
ten
seconds
and
the
flight
distance
something
over
thirty
miles
since
the
stretts
could
orient
themselves
in
less
than
one
second
after
emergence
even
this
extremely
tight
packing
of
missiles
only
sixty
miles
apart
throughout
the
entire
emergence
volume
of
space
would
still
give
the
stretts
the
initiative
by
a
of
more
than
ten
to
one
such
tight
packing
was
of
course
impossible
it
called
for
many
billions
of
defenders
instead
of
the
few
millions
it
was
possible
for
the
omans
to
produce
in
the
time
they
had
in
fact
the
average
spacing
was
well
over
ten
thousand
miles
when
the
invading
horde
of
strett
missiles
emerged
and
struck
they
struck
there
was
nothing
of
finesse
about
that
attack
nothing
of
skill
or
of
tactics
nothing
but
the
sheer
brute
force
of
overwhelming
superiority
of
numbers
and
of
power
one
instant
all
space
was
empty
the
next
instant
it
was
full
of
invading
missiles
a
superb
exhibition
of
coordination
and
timing
and
the
kedy
control
upon
which
the
defenders
had
counted
so
heavily
proved
useless
for
each
strett
missile
within
a
fraction
of
a
second
of
emergence
darted
toward
the
nearest
oman
missile
with
an
acceleration
that
made
the
defenders
seem
to
be
standing
still
one
to
one
missiles
crashed
into
missiles
and
detonated
there
were
no
solid
or
liquid
each
of
those
frightful
weapons
carried
so
many
of
atomic
concentrate
that
all
nearby
space
blossomed
out
into
superatomic
blasts
hundreds
of
times
more
violent
than
the
fireballs
of
fusion
bombs
for
a
moment
even
hilton
was
stunned
but
only
for
a
moment
kedy
he
barked
get
your
big
stuff
out
there
use
the
boosters
he
started
for
the
door
at
a
full
run
that
tears
it
that
tears
it
scrap
the
plan
i
board
the
and
take
the
to
strett
bring
your
stuff
along
skipper
as
soon
as
you
ready
ardan
superdreadnoughts
in
their
massed
thousands
poured
out
through
ardvor
screen
each
went
instantly
to
work
now
the
kedy
control
system
doing
what
it
was
designed
to
do
proved
its
full
worth
for
the
weapons
of
the
big
did
not
depend
upon
acceleration
but
were
driven
at
the
speed
of
light
and
grand
fleet
operations
were
planned
and
were
carried
out
at
the
almost
infinite
velocity
of
thought
itself
or
rather
they
were
not
planned
at
all
they
were
simply
carried
out
immediately
and
without
confusion
for
all
the
kedys
were
one
each
kedy
element
without
any
lapse
of
time
whatever
for
consultation
with
any
other
knew
exactly
where
every
other
element
was
exactly
what
each
was
doing
and
exactly
what
he
himself
should
do
to
make
maximum
contribution
to
the
common
cause
nor
was
any
time
lost
in
relaying
orders
to
crewmen
within
the
ship
there
were
no
crewmen
each
kedy
element
was
the
sole
personnel
of
and
was
integral
with
his
vessel
nor
were
there
any
wires
or
relays
to
impede
and
slow
down
communication
operational
instructions
too
were
transmitted
and
were
acted
upon
with
thought
transfinite
speed
thus
if
decision
and
execution
were
not
quite
mathematically
simultaneous
they
were
separated
by
a
period
of
time
so
infinitesimally
small
as
to
be
impossible
of
separation
wherever
a
strett
missile
was
or
wherever
a
strett
appeared
an
oman
beam
reached
it
usually
in
much
less
than
one
second
beam
clung
to
screen
caressingly
hungrily
absorbing
its
total
energy
and
forming
the
booster
then
three
microseconds
later
that
booster
went
off
into
a
ragingly
incandescent
glaringly
violent
burst
of
fury
so
hellishly
so
inconceivably
hot
that
less
than
a
thousandth
of
its
total
output
of
energy
was
below
the
very
top
of
the
visible
spectrum
if
the
previous
display
of
atomic
violence
had
been
so
spectacular
and
of
such
magnitude
as
to
defy
understanding
or
description
what
of
this
when
hundreds
of
thousands
of
kedys
each
wielding
powers
as
effortlessly
and
as
deftly
and
as
precisely
as
thought
attacked
and
destroyed
millions
of
those
tremendously
powerful
of
the
stretts
the
only
simple
answer
is
that
all
nearby
space
might
very
well
have
been
torn
out
of
the
most
radiant
layers
of
itself
hilton
made
the
hundred
yards
from
office
door
to
curb
in
just
over
twelve
seconds
larry
was
waiting
the
car
literally
burned
a
hole
in
the
atmosphere
as
it
screamed
its
way
to
ardane
field
it
landed
with
a
thump
heavy
black
streaks
of
synthetic
rubber
marked
the
pavement
as
it
came
to
a
screeching
shrieking
stop
at
the
flagship
main
lock
and
in
the
instant
of
closing
that
lock
outer
portal
all
warships
of
the
task
force
took
off
as
one
at
ten
gravities
took
off
and
in
less
than
one
minute
went
into
overdrive
all
personal
haste
was
now
over
hilton
went
up
into
what
he
still
thought
of
as
the
control
room
even
though
he
knew
that
there
were
no
controls
nor
even
any
instruments
anywhere
aboard
he
knew
what
he
would
find
there
fast
as
he
had
acted
temple
had
not
had
as
far
to
go
and
she
had
got
there
first
he
could
not
have
said
for
the
life
of
him
how
he
actually
felt
about
this
direct
defiance
of
his
direct
orders
he
walked
into
the
room
sat
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
i
told
you
to
stay
home
temple
he
said
i
know
you
did
but
i
not
only
the
assistant
head
of
your
psychology
department
i
your
wife
remember
death
do
us
part
and
if
there
any
way
in
the
universe
i
can
manage
it
death
is
going
to
part
us
at
least
this
one
is
if
this
is
it
we
go
together
i
know
sweetheart
he
put
his
arm
around
her
held
her
close
as
a
psych
i
would
give
a
whoop
you
be
expendable
but
as
my
wife
especially
now
that
you
pregnant
you
are
you
a
lot
more
important
to
the
future
of
our
race
than
i
am
she
stiffened
in
the
circle
of
his
arm
what
crack
supposed
to
mean
think
i
ever
accept
a
synthetic
zombie
imitation
of
you
for
my
husband
and
go
on
living
with
it
just
as
though
nothing
had
happened
hilton
started
to
say
something
but
temple
rushed
heedlessly
on
the
race
no
matter
how
many
children
we
ever
have
you
were
first
and
you
first
and
if
you
have
to
go
i
go
too
so
there
besides
you
know
darn
well
that
they
ca
duplicate
whatever
it
is
that
makes
you
jarvis
hilton
now
wait
a
minute
tempy
the
conversion
yes
the
conversion
she
interrupted
triumphantly
the
thing
talking
about
is
immaterial
untouchable
they
did
could
do
any
thing
about
it
at
all
kedy
will
you
please
tell
this
big
goofus
that
even
though
you
have
got
jarvis
hilton
brain
you
are
jarvis
hilton
and
never
can
be
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
vibrated
in
the
frequencies
of
a
deep
bass
laugh
you
are
trying
to
hold
a
completely
untenable
position
friend
hilton
any
attempt
to
convince
a
mind
of
real
power
that
falsity
is
truth
is
illogical
my
advice
is
for
you
to
surrender
that
word
hit
temple
hard
not
surrender
sweetheart
i
not
fighting
you
i
never
will
she
seized
both
of
his
hands
tears
welled
into
her
glorious
eyes
it
just
that
i
simply
could
it
to
go
on

got
up
and
lifted
her
to
her
feet
so
that
she
could
come
properly
into
his
arms
they
stood
there
silent
and
motionless
for
minutes
temple
finally
released
herself
and
after
feeling
for
a
handkerchief
she
did
not
have
wiped
her
eyes
with
a
forefinger
and
then
wiped
the
finger
on
her
bare
leg
she
grinned
and
turned
to
the
omans
prince
will
you
and
dark
lady
please
conjure
us
up
a
supper
they
should
be
in
the
pantry
since
this
was
designed
for
us
after
supper
the
two
sat
companionably
on
a
davenport
one
thing
about
this
business
is
quite
clear
temple
said
why
all
this
tearing
rush
they
have
got
the
booster
or
anything
like
it
or
they
have
used
it
surely
it
take
them
a
long
time
to
go
from
the
mere
analysis
of
the
forces
and
fields
we
used
clear
through
to
the
production
and
installation
of
enough
weapons
to
stop
this
whole
fleet
it
surely
wo
they
had
the
absorption
principle
for
ages
remember
that
first
ancient
skeleton
that
drained
all
the
power
of
our
suits
and
boats
in
nothing
flat
from
there
it
is
too
big
a
jump
and
as
for
producing
stuff
if
there
any
limit
to
what
they
can
do
i
do
know
what
it
is
if
we
do
slug
before
they
get
it
it
curtains
i
see
i
afraid
we
almost
there
darling
he
glanced
at
the
chronometer
about
eleven
minutes
and
of
course
i
do
need
to
ask
you
to
stay
out
of
the
way
of
course
not
i
wo
interfere
no
matter
what
happens
all
i
going
to
do
is
hold
your
hand
and
pull
for
you
with
all
my
might
that
help
believe
me
i
mighty
glad
you
along
sweetheart
even
though
both
of
us
know
you
should
be

toward
its

in
a
mathematically
exact
envelope
around
the
planet
strett
hilton
sat
on
a
davenport
strained
and
still
his
eyes
were
closed
and
every
muscle
tense
left
hand
gripped
the
so
fiercely
that
fingertips
were
inches
deep
in
the
padding
the
stretts
that
any
such
attack
as
this
was
futile
no
movable
structure
or
any
combination
of
such
structures
could
possibly
wield
enough
power
to
break
down
screens
powered
by
such
engines
as
theirs
hilton
however
knew
that
there
was
a
chance
not
with
the
boosters
which
were
manipulable
and
detonable
masses
of
ball
lightning
but
with
those
boosters
culminations
the
vangs
which
were
ball
lightning
raised
to
the
sixth
power
and
which
only
the
frightful
energies
of
the
boosters
could
bring
into
being
but
even
with
vangs
or
any
larger
number
success
depended
entirely
upon
a
nicety
of
timing
never
before
approached
and
supposedly
impossible
not
only
to
thousandths
of
a
microsecond
but
to
a
small
fraction
of
one
such
thousandth
roughly
the
time
it
takes
light
to
travel
of
an
inch
it
would
take
practically
absolute
simultaneity
to
overload
to
the
point
of
burnout
to
those
strett
generators
they
were
the
heaviest
in
the
galaxy
that
was
why
hilton
himself
had
to
be
there
he
could
not
possibly
have
done
the
job
from
ardvor
in
fact
there
was
no
real
assurance
that
even
at
the
immeasurable
velocity
of
thought
and
covering
a
mere
million
miles
he
could
do
it
even
from
his
present
position
aboard
one
unit
of
the
fleet
theoretically
with
his
he
could
but
that
theory
had
yet
to
be
reduced
to
practice
tense
and
strained
hilton
began
his
countdown
temple
sat
beside
him
both
hands
pressed
his
right
fist
against
her
breast
her
eyes
too
were
closed
she
was
as
stiff
and
as
still
as
was
he
she
was
not
interfering
but
giving
supporting
him
backing
him
giving
to
him
in
full
flood
everything
of
that
tremendous
inner
strength
that
had
made
temple
bells
what
she
so
uniquely
was
on
the
exact
center
of
the
zero
beat
every
kedy
struck
gripped
and
activated
as
they
all
were
by
mind
they
struck
in
what
was
very
close
indeed
to
absolute
unison
absorbing
beams
each
one
having
had
precisely
the
same
number
of
millimeters
to
travel
reached
the
screen
at
the
same
instant
they
clung
and
sucked
immeasurable
floods
of
energy
flashed
from
the
strett
generators
into
those
vortices
to
form
twenty
boosters
but
this
time
the
boosters
did
not
detonate
instead
as
energies
continued
to
flood
in
at
a
frightfully
accelerating
rate
they
turned
into
something
else
things
no
terran
science
has
ever
even
imagined
things
at
the
formation
of
which
all
neighboring
space
actually
warped
and
in
that
warping
seethed
and
writhed
and
shuddered
the
very
screamed
and
shrieked
in
protest
as
it
too
yielded
in
starkly
impossible
fashions
to
that
irresistible
stress
how
even
those
brains
stood
it
not
one
of
them
ever
knew
microsecond
by
slow
microsecond
the
vangs
grew
and
grew
and
grew
they
were
pulling
not
only
the
full
power
of
the
ardan
warships
but
also
the
immeasurably
greater
power
of
the
strainingly
overloaded
strettsian
generators
themselves
the
ethereal
and
writhings
and
distortions
and
screamings
grew
worse
and
worse
harder
and
ever
harder
to
bear
imagine
if
you
can
a
constantly
and
rapidly
increasing
mass
of
plutonium
a
mass
already
thousands
of
times
greater
than
critical
but
not
to
react
that
gives
a
faint
and
very
inadequate
picture
of
what
was
happening
then
finally
at
perhaps
a
hundred
thousand
times
critical
mass
and
still
in
perfect
sync
the
vangs
all
went
off
the
planet
strett
became
a
nova

won
we
temple
shrieked
her
perception
piercing
through
the
hellish
murk
that
was
all
nearby
space
not
quite
yet
sweet
but
we
over
the
biggest
hump
and
the
two
held
an
impromptu
but
highly
satisfactory
celebration
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
say
that
the
planet
strett
became
a
nova
since
the
actual
nova
stage
was
purely
superficial
and
did
not
last
very
long
in
a
couple
of
hours
things
had
quieted
down
enough
so
that
the
warships
could
approach
the
planet
and
finish
up
their
part
of
the
job
much
of
strett
land
surface
was
molten
lava
much
of
its
water
was
gone
there
were
some
pockets
of
resistance
left
of
course
but
they
did
not
last
long
equally
of
course
the
stretts
themselves
miles
underground
had
not
been
harmed
at
all
but
that
too
was
according
to
plan
leaving
the
task
force
on
guard
to
counter
any
move
the
stretts
might
be
able
to
make
hilton
shot
the

to
the
planet
moon
there
sawtelle
and
his
staff
and
tens
of
thousands
of
omans
and
machines
were
starting
to
work
no
part
of
this
was
hilton
job
so
all
he
and
temple
did
was
look
on
correction
please
that
was
not
they
did
but
while
resting
and
eating
and
loafing
and
sleeping
and
enjoying
each

very
slowly
at

but
faster
and

they
continued
to
blast
with
all
their
prodigious
might
and
in

until
the

was
attained
an
orbit
which
terminated
in
a
vertical

through

of

approximately
seven

and

impact
after
having
fallen
from

a
quarter
of
a

miles
under
the

and
the

the

of
such

can
be
computed
it
can
be

it
is
however
of
such
astronomical
magnitude
as
to
be
completely
meaningless

simply
the

and

of

out
into

only
to
return
in

or

to

their

to

enormity
of

upward

went
up

of

hundred
ten
feet
then
straightening
out
into
a
shapely
arrow
and
without

moving

she
hurtled
downward
making

a
half
beautifully
stately
turns
and
striking

coming

dark

her

raised
her

enough
to
be

heard
the

shot
him
a

announced
it

hope
to

okay

thanks
tell
