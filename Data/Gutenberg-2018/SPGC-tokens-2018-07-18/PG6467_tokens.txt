introduction
most
of
the
letters
in
this
volume
were
written
by
theodore
roosevelt
to
his
children
during
a
period
of
more
than
twenty
years
a
few
others
are
included
that
he
wrote
to
friends
or
relatives
about
the
children
he
began
to
write
to
them
in
their
early
childhood
and
continued
to
do
so
regularly
till
they
reached
maturity
whenever
he
was
separated
from
them
in
the
spanish
war
or
on
a
hunting
trip
or
because
they
were
at
school
he
sent
them
these
messages
of
constant
thought
and
love
for
they
were
never
for
a
moment
out
of
his
mind
and
heart
long
before
they
were
able
to
read
he
sent
them
what
they
called
picture
letters
with
crude
drawings
of
his
own
in
illustration
of
the
written
text
drawings
precisely
adapted
to
the
childish
imagination
and
intelligence
that
the
little
recipients
cherished
these
delightful
missives
is
shown
by
the
tender
care
with
which
they
preserved
them
from
destruction
they
are
in
good
condition
after
many
years
of
loving
usage
a
few
of
them
are
reproduced
in
these
pages
written
at
different
periods
as
each
new
child
appeared
in
the
household
these
early
letters
are
marked
by
the
same
quality
that
distinguishes
all
his
letters
to
his
children
from
the
youngest
to
the
eldest
he
wrote
to
them
always
as
his
equals
as
they
advanced
in
life
the
mental
level
of
intercourse
was
raised
as
they
grew
in
intelligence
and
knowledge
but
it
was
always
as
equals
that
he
addressed
them
he
was
always
their
playmate
and
boon
companion
whether
they
were
toddling
infants
taking
their
first
faltering
steps
or
growing
schoolboys
or
youths
standing
at
the
threshold
of
life
their
games
were
his
games
their
joys
those
of
his
own
heart
he
was
ready
to
romp
with
them
in
the
old
barn
at
sagamore
hill
play
tickley
at
bedtime
join
in
their
pillow
fights
or
play
with
them
either
at
sagamore
hill
or
in
the
white
house
he
was
the
same
chosen
and
joyous
companion
always
and
everywhere
occasionally
he
was
disturbed
for
a
moment
about
possible
injury
to
his
presidential
dignity
describing
a
romp
in
the
old
barn
at
sagamore
hill
in
the
summer
of
he
said
in
one
of
his
letters
that
under
the
insistence
of
the
children
he
had
joined
in
it
because
i
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
but
really
it
seems
to
put
it
mildly
rather
odd
for
a
stout
elderly
president
to
be
bouncing
over
hayricks
in
a
wild
effort
to
get
to
goal
before
an
active
midget
of
a
competitor
aged
nine
years
however
it
was
really
great
fun
it
was
because
he
at
heart
regarded
it
as
great
fun
and
was
in
complete
accord
with
the
children
that
they
delighted
in
him
as
a
playmate
in
the
same
spirit
in
january
he
took
a
squad
of
nine
boys
including
three
of
his
own
on
what
they
called
a
scramble
through
rock
creek
park
in
washington
which
meant
traversing
the
most
difficult
places
in
it
the
boys
had
permission
to
make
the
trip
alone
but
they
insisted
upon
his
company
i
am
really
touched
he
wrote
afterward
to
the
parents
of
two
of
the
visiting
boys
at
the
way
in
which
your
children
as
well
as
my
own
treat
me
as
a
friend
and
playmate
it
has
its
comic
side
they
were
all
bent
upon
having
me
take
them
they
obviously
felt
that
my
presence
was
needed
to
give
zest
to
the
entertainment
i
do
not
think
that
one
of
them
saw
anything
incongruous
in
the
president
getting
as
bedaubed
with
mud
as
they
got
or
in
my
wiggling
and
clambering
around
jutting
rocks
through
cracks
and
up
what
were
really
small
cliff
faces
just
like
the
rest
of
them
and
whenever
any
one
of
them
beat
me
at
any
point
he
felt
and
expressed
simple
and
delight
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
a
triumph
over
a
rival
of
his
own
age
when
the
time
came
that
he
was
no
longer
the
children
chosen
playmate
he
recognized
the
fact
with
a
twinge
of
sadness
writing
in
january
to
his
daughter
ethel
who
was
at
sagamore
hill
at
the
time
he
said
of
a
party
of
boys
that
quentin
had
at
the
white
house
they
played
hard
and
it
made
me
realize
how
old
i
had
grown
and
how
very
busy
i
had
been
the
last
few
years
to
find
that
they
had
grown
so
that
i
was
not
needed
in
the
play
do
you
recollect
how
we
all
of
us
used
to
play
hide
and
go
seek
in
the
white
house
and
have
obstacle
races
down
the
hall
when
you
brought
in
your
friends
deep
and
abiding
love
of
children
of
family
and
home
that
was
the
dominating
passion
of
his
life
with
that
went
love
for
friends
and
fellow
men
and
for
all
living
things
birds
animals
trees
flowers
and
nature
in
all
its
moods
and
aspects
but
love
of
children
and
family
and
home
was
above
all
the
children
always
had
an
christmas
in
the
white
house
in
several
letters
in
these
pages
descriptions
of
these
festivals
will
be
found
in
closing
one
of
them
the
eternal
child
heart
in
the
man
cries
out
i
wonder
whether
there
ever
can
come
in
life
a
thrill
of
greater
exaltation
and
rapture
than
that
which
comes
to
one
between
the
ages
of
say
six
and
fourteen
when
the
library
door
is
thrown
open
and
you
walk
in
to
see
all
the
gifts
like
a
materialized
fairy
land
arrayed
on
your
special
table
his
love
for
the
home
he
had
built
and
in
which
his
beloved
children
had
been
born
was
not
even
dimmed
by
his
life
in
the
white
house
after
all
he
wrote
to
ethel
in
june
fond
as
i
am
of
the
white
house
and
much
though
i
have
appreciated
these
years
in
it
there
is
any
place
in
the
world
like
home
like
sagamore
hill
where
things
are
our
own
with
their
own
associations
and
where
it
is
real
country
through
all
his
letters
runs
his
inexhaustible
vein
of
delicious
humor
all
the
quaint
sayings
of
quentin
that
quaintest
of
small
boys
all
the
antics
of
the
household
cats
and
dogs
all
the
comic
aspects
of
the
and
others
of
the
large
menagerie
of
pets
that
the
children
were
always
collecting
all
the
tricks
and
feats
of
the
these
together
with
every
item
of
household
news
that
would
amuse
and
cheer
and
keep
alive
the
love
of
home
in
the
heart
of
the
absent
boys
was
set
forth
in
letters
which
in
gayety
of
spirit
and
charm
of
manner
have
few
equals
in
literature
and
no
superiors
no
matter
how
great
the
pressure
of
public
duties
or
how
severe
the
strain
that
the
trials
and
burdens
of
office
placed
upon
the
nerves
and
spirits
of
the
president
of
a
great
nation
this
devoted
father
and
companion
found
time
to
send
every
week
a
long
letter
of
this
delightful
character
to
each
of
his
absent
children
as
the
boys
advanced
toward
manhood
the
letters
still
on
the
basis
of
equality
contain
much
wise
suggestion
and
occasional
admonition
the
latter
always
administered
in
a
loving
spirit
accompanied
by
apology
for
writing
in
a
preaching
vein
the
playmate
of
childhood
became
the
sympathetic
and
keenly
interested
companion
in
all
athletic
contests
in
the
reading
of
books
and
the
consideration
of
authors
and
in
the
discussion
of
politics
and
public
affairs
many
of
these
letters
notably
those
on
the
relative
merits
of
civil
and
military
careers
and
the
proper
proportions
of
sport
and
study
are
valuable
guides
for
youth
in
all
ranks
of
life
the
strong
vigorous
exalted
character
of
the
writer
stands
revealed
in
these
as
in
all
the
other
letters
as
well
as
the
cheerful
soul
of
the
man
which
remained
throughout
his
life
as
pure
and
gentle
as
the
soul
of
a
child
only
a
short
time
before
he
died
he
said
to
me
as
we
were
going
over
the
letters
and
planning
this
volume
which
is
arranged
as
he
wished
it
to
be
i
would
rather
have
this
book
published
than
anything
that
has
ever
been
written
about
me
the
letters

spanish

cross

tired

very
dirty

out
to
inspect

were
drilling
off
santiago
darling

near

and
everything
is
in
a
bustle
for

do
not
know
when
i
shall
have
another
chance
to
write
to
my
three
blessed
children

is
only
a
line
to

much

you
the
picture
of

little
when

ethel
i
loved
your
little
letter
here
there
are
lots
of
funny
little
lizards
that
run
about
in
the
dusty
roads
very
fast
and
then
stand
still
with
their
heads
up
beautiful
red
cardinal
birds
and
tanagers
flit
about
in
the
woods
and
the
flowers
are
lovely
but
you
never
saw
such
dust
sometimes
i
lie
on
the
ground
outside
and
sometimes
in
the
tent
i
have
a
mosquito
net
because
there
are
so
many
mosquitoes
camp

july
darling
ethel
when
it
rains
here
and
it
very
apt
to
rain
here
every
day
it
comes
down
just
as
if
it
was
a
torrent
of
water
the
other
night
i
hung
up
my
hammock
in
my
tent
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
there
was
a
terrific
storm
and
my
tent
and
hammock
came
down
with
a
run
the
water
was
running
over
the
ground
in
a
sheet
and
the
mud
was
so
i
was
a
drenched
and
muddy
object
when
i
got
to
a
neighboring
tent
where
i
was
given
a
blanket
in
which
i
rolled
up
and
went
to
sleep
there
is
a
funny
little
lizard
that
comes
into
my
tent
and
is
quite
tame
now
he
jumps
about
like
a
little
frog
and
puffs
his
throat
out
there
are
no
bigger
than
big
sparrows
and
cuckoos
almost
as
large
as
crows
youthful
bible
commentators
to
miss
emily
carow
oyster
bay
the
other
day
i
listened
to
a
most
amusing
dialogue
at
the
bible
lesson
between
kermit
and
ethel
the
subject
was
joseph
and
just
before
reading
it
they
had
been
reading
quentin
book
containing
the
adventures
of
the
gollywogs
joseph
conduct
in
repeating
his
dream
to
his
brothers
whom
it
was
certain
to
irritate
had
struck
both
of
the
children
unfavorably
as
conflicting
both
with
the
laws
of
and
with
the
advice
given
them
by
their
parents
as
to
the
proper
method
of
dealing
with
their
own
brothers
and
sisters
kermit
said
well
i
think
that
was
very
foolish
of
joseph
ethel
chimed
in
with
so
do
i
very
foolish
and
i
do
not
understand
how
he
could
have
done
it
then
after
a
pause
kermit
added
thoughtfully
by
way
of
explanation
well
i
guess
he
was
simple
like
jane
in
the
gollywogs
and
ethel
nodded
gravely
in
confirmation
it
is
very
cunning
to
see
kermit
and
archie
go
to
the
cove
school
together
they
also
come
down
and
chop
with
me
archie
being
armed
with
a
hatchet
blunt
enough
to
be
suitable
for
his
six
years
he
is
a
most
industrious
small
chopper
and
the
other
day
gnawed
down
or
as
the
children
call
it
beavered
down
a
misshapen
tulip
tree
which
was
about
fifty
feet
high
fine
names
for
guinea
pigs
to
martin
oyster
bay
roosevelt
and
i
were
more
touched
than
i
can
well
say
at
your
sending
us
your
book
with
its
characteristic
insertion
and
above
all
with
the
little
extract
from
your
boy
note
about
ted
in
what
form
is
your
boy
as
you
have
laid
yourself
open
i
shall
tell
you
that
ted
sings
in
the
choir
and
is
captain
of
his
dormitory
football
team
he
was
awfully
homesick
at
first
but
now
he
has
won
his
place
in
his
own
little
world
and
he
is
all
right
in
his
last
letter
to
his
mother
in
response
to
a
question
about
his
clothes
he
answered
that
they
were
in
good
condition
excepting
that
one
pair
of
pants
was
split
up
the
middle
and
one
jacket
had
lost
a
sleeve
in
a
scuffle
and
in
another
pair
of
pants
he
had
sat
down
in
a
jam
pie
at
a
cellar
spread
we
have
both
missed
him
greatly
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
have
five
remaining
did
i
ever
tell
you
about
my
second
small
boy
names
for
his
guinea
pigs
they
included
bishop
doane
johnson
my
dutch
reformed
pastor
father
grady
the
local
priest
with
whom
the
children
had
scraped
a
speaking
acquaintance
fighting
bob
evans
and
admiral
dewey
some
of
my
republican
supporters
in
west
virginia
have
just
sent
me
a
small
bear
which
the
children
of
their
own
accord
christened
jonathan
edwards
partly
out
of
compliment
to
their
mother
ancestor
and
partly
because
they
thought
they
detected
calvinistic
traits
in
the
character
a
cougar
and
lynx
hunt
keystone
ranch
blessed
ted
from
the
railroad
we
drove
fifty
miles
to
the
little
frontier
town
of
meeker
there
we
were
met
by
the
hunter
goff
a
fine
quiet
hardy
fellow
who
knows
his
business
thoroughly
next
morning
we
started
on
horseback
while
our
luggage
went
by
wagon
to
goff
ranch
we
started
soon
after
sunrise
and
made
our
way
hunting
as
we
went
across
the
high
exceedingly
rugged
hills
until
sunset
we
were
hunting
cougar
and
lynx
or
as
they
are
called
out
here
lion
and
cat
the
first
cat
we
put
up
gave
the
dogs
a
two
hours
chase
and
got
away
among
some
high
cliffs
in
the
afternoon
we
put
up
another
and
had
a
very
good
run
the
dogs
baying
until
the
glens
rang
again
to
the
echoes
as
they
worked
hither
and
thither
through
the
ravines
we
walked
our
ponies
up
and
down
steep
and
slopes
where
it
did
not
seem
possible
a
horse
could
climb
and
on
the
level
places
we
got
one
or
two
smart
gallops
at
last
the
lynx
went
up
a
tree
then
i
saw
a
really
funny
sight
seven
hounds
had
been
doing
the
trailing
while
a
large
brindled
bloodhound
and
two
between
collie
and
bull
stayed
behind
goff
running
so
close
to
his
horse
heels
that
they
continually
bumped
into
them
which
he
accepted
with
philosophic
composure
then
the
dogs
proceeded
literally
to
the
which
was
a
pinon
one
of
the
named
tony
got
up
certainly
sixteen
feet
until
the
lynx
which
looked
like
a
huge
and
exceedingly
malevolent
made
vicious
dabs
at
him
i
shot
the
lynx
low
so
as
not
to
hurt
his
skin
yesterday
we
were
in
the
saddle
for
ten
hours
the
dogs
ran
one
lynx
down
and
killed
it
among
the
rocks
after
a
vigorous
scuffle
it
was
in
a
hole
and
only
two
of
them
could
get
at
it
this
morning
soon
after
starting
out
we
struck
the
cold
trail
of
a
mountain
lion
the
hounds
puzzled
about
for
nearly
two
hours
going
up
and
down
the
great
gorges
until
we
sometimes
absolutely
lost
even
the
sound
of
the
baying
then
they
struck
the
fresh
trail
where
the
cougar
had
killed
a
deer
over
night
in
half
an
hour
a
clamorous
yelling
told
us
they
had
overtaken
the
quarry
for
we
had
been
riding
up
the
slopes
and
along
the
crests
wherever
it
was
possible
for
the
horses
to
get
footing
as
we
plunged
and
scrambled
down
towards
the
noise
one
of
my
companions
phil
stewart
stopped
us
while
he
took
a
kodak
of
a
rabbit
which
sat
unconcernedly
right
beside
our
path
soon
we
saw
the
lion
in
a
treetop
with
two
of
the
dogs
so
high
up
among
the
branches
that
he
was
striking
at
them
he
was
more
afraid
of
us
than
of
the
dogs
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
took
a
great
flying
leap
and
was
off
the
pack
close
behind
in
a
few
hundred
yards
they
had
him
up
another
tree
here
i
could
have
shot
him
tony
climbed
almost
up
to
him
and
then
fell
twenty
feet
out
of
the
tree
but
waited
for
stewart
to
get
a
photo
and
he
jumped
again
this
time
after
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
the
dogs
caught
him
and
a
great
fight
followed
they
could
have
killed
him
by
themselves
but
he
bit
or
clawed
four
of
them
and
for
fear
he
might
kill
one
i
ran
in
and
stabbed
him
behind
the
shoulder
thrusting
the
knife
you
loaned
me
right
into
his
heart
i
have
always
wished
to
kill
a
cougar
as
i
did
this
one
with
dogs
and
the
knife
dogs
that
climb
trees
keystone
ranch
darling
little
ethel
i
have
had
great
fun
most
of
the
trip
neither
you
nor
mother
nor
sister
would
enjoy
but
you
would
all
of
you
be
immensely
amused
with
the
dogs
there
are
eleven
all
told
but
really
only
eight
do
very
much
hunting
these
eight
are
all
scarred
with
the
wounds
they
have
received
this
very
week
in
battling
with
the
cougars
and
lynxes
and
they
are
always
threatening
to
fight
one
another
but
they
are
as
affectionate
toward
men
and
especially
toward
me
as
i
pet
them
as
our
own
home
dogs
at
this
moment
a
large
hound
and
a
small
both
of
whom
were
quite
badly
wounded
this
morning
by
a
cougar
are
shoving
their
noses
into
my
lap
to
be
petted
and
humming
defiance
to
one
another
they
are
on
excellent
terms
with
the
ranch
cat
and
kittens
the
three
chief
fighting
dogs
who
do
not
follow
the
trail
are
the
most
affectionate
of
all
and
moreover
they
climb
trees
yesterday
we
got
a
big
lynx
in
the
top
of
a
pinon
tree
a
low
spreading
kind
of
pine
about
thirty
feet
tall
turk
the
bloodhound
followed
him
up
and
after
much
sprawling
actually
got
to
the
very
top
within
a
couple
of
feet
of
him
then
when
the
lynx
was
shot
out
of
the
tree
turk
after
a
short
scramble
took
a
header
down
through
the
branches
landing
with
a
bounce
on
his
back
tony
one
of
the
takes
such
headers
on
an
average
at
least
once
for
every
animal
we
put
up
a
tree
we
have
nice
little
horses
which
climb
the
most
extraordinary
places
you
can
imagine
get
mother
to
show
you
some
of
gustave
dore
trees
the
trees
on
these
mountains
look
just
like
them
the
pig
named
maude
keystone
ranch
darling
little
ethel
you
would
be
much
amused
with
the
animals
round
the
ranch
the
most
thoroughly
independent
and
of
them
is
a
large
white
pig
which
we
have
christened
maude
she
goes
everywhere
at
her
own
will
she
picks
up
scraps
from
the
dogs
who
bay
dismally
at
her
but
know
they
have
no
right
to
kill
her
and
then
she
eats
the
green
alfalfa
hay
from
the
two
milch
cows
who
live
in
the
big
corral
with
the
horses
one
of
the
dogs
has
just
had
a
litter
of
puppies
you
would
love
them
with
their
little
wrinkled
noses
and
squeaky
voices
advice
and
news
oyster
bay
may
blessed
ted
it
was
the
greatest
fun
seeing
you
and
i
really
had
a
satisfactory
time
with
you
and
came
away
feeling
that
you
were
doing
well
i
am
entirely
satisfied
with
your
standing
both
in
your
studies
and
in
athletics
i
want
you
to
do
well
in
your
sports
and
i
want
even
more
to
have
you
do
well
with
your
books
but
i
do
not
expect
you
to
stand
first
in
either
if
so
to
stand
could
cause
you
overwork
and
hurt
your
health
i
always
believe
in
going
hard
at
everything
whether
it
is
latin
or
mathematics
boxing
or
football
but
at
the
same
time
i
want
to
keep
the
sense
of
proportion
it
is
never
worth
while
to
absolutely
exhaust
one
self
or
to
take
big
chances
unless
for
an
adequate
object
i
want
you
to
keep
in
training
the
faculties
which
would
make
you
if
the
need
arose
able
to
put
your
last
ounce
of
pluck
and
strength
into
a
contest
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
squander
these
qualities
to
have
you
play
football
as
well
as
you
do
and
make
a
good
name
in
boxing
and
wrestling
and
be
cox
of
your
second
crew
and
stand
second
or
third
in
your
class
in
the
studies
is
all
right
i
should
be
rather
sorry
to
see
you
drop
too
near
the
middle
of
your
class
because
as
you
can
not
enter
college
until
you
are
nineteen
and
will
therefore
be
a
year
later
in
entering
life
i
want
you
to
be
prepared
in
the
best
possible
way
so
as
to
make
up
for
the
delay
but
i
know
that
all
you
can
do
you
will
do
to
keep
substantially
the
position
in
the
class
that
you
have
so
far
kept
and
i
have
entire
trust
in
you
for
you
have
always
deserved
it
the
weather
has
been
lovely
here
the
cherry
trees
are
in
full
bloom
the
peach
trees
just
opening
while
the
apples
will
not
be
out
for
ten
days
the
may
flowers
and
bloodroot
have
gone
the
anemonies
and
bellwort
have
come
and
the
violets
are
coming
all
the
birds
are
here
pretty
much
and
the
warblers
troop
through
the
woods
to
my
delight
yesterday
kermit
when
i
tried
him
on
diamond
did
excellently
he
has
evidently
turned
the
corner
in
his
riding
and
was
just
as
much
at
home
as
possible
although
he
was
on
my
saddle
with
his
feet
thrust
in
the
leathers
above
the
stirrup
poor
mother
has
had
a
hard
time
with
yagenka
for
she
rubbed
her
back
and
as
she
sadly
needs
exercise
and
i
could
not
have
a
saddle
put
upon
her
i
took
her
out
bareback
yesterday
her
gaits
are
so
easy
that
it
is
really
more
comfortable
to
ride
her
without
a
saddle
than
to
ride
texas
with
one
and
i
gave
her
three
miles
sharp
cantering
and
trotting
dewey
is
a
very
cunning
white
guinea
pig
i
wish
you
could
see
kermit
taking
out
dewey
and
bob
evans
to
spend
the
day
on
the
grass
archie
is
the
sweetest
little
fellow
imaginable
he
is
always
thinking
of
you
he
has
now
struck
up
a
great
friendship
with
nicholas
rather
to
mame
the
nurse
regret
as
mame
would
like
to
keep
him
purely
for
quentin
the
small
boisterous
person
was
in
fearful
disgrace
this
morning
having
flung
a
block
at
his
mother
head
it
was
done
in
sheer
playfulness
but
of
course
could
not
be
passed
over
lightly
and
after
the
enormity
of
the
crime
had
been
brought
fully
home
to
him
he
fled
with
howls
of
anguish
to
me
and
lay
in
an
abandon
of
grief
in
my
arms
ethel
is
earning
money
for
the
purchase
of
the

industriously

going
to
ride
yagenka
bareback
this
afternoon
while
i
try
to
teach
ethel
on
diamond
after
kermit
has
had
his
ride
yesterday
at
dinner
we
were
talking
of
how
badly
poor
blank
looked
and
kermit
suddenly
observed
in
an
aside
to
ethel
entirely
unconscious
that
we
were
listening
oh
effel
i
tell
you
what
blank
looks
like
like
davis
hen
dat
died
you
know
de
one
dat
could
hop
up
on
de
perch
naturally
this
is
purely
a
private
anecdote
archie
and
quentin
oyster
bay
may
blessed
ted
recently
i
have
gone
in
to
play
with
archie
and
quentin
after
they
have
gone
to
bed
and
they
have
grown
to
expect
me
jumping
up
very
soft
and
warm
in
their
tommies
expecting
me
to
roll
them
over
on
the
bed
and
tickle
and
grabble
in
them
however
it
has
proved
rather
too
exciting
and
an
edict
has
gone
forth
that
hereafter
i
must
play
bear
with
them
before
supper
and
give
up
the
play
when
they
have
gone
to
bed
was
archie
birthday
and
quentin
resented
archie
having
presents
while
he
quentin
had
none
with
the
appalling
frankness
of
three
years
old
he
remarked
with
great
sincerity
that
it
made
him
miserable
and
when
taken
to
task
for
his
lack
of
altruistic
spirit
he
expressed
an
obviously
perfunctory
repentance
and
said
well
boys
must
lend
boys
things
at
any
rate
incidents
of
oyster
bay
may
blessed
ted
i
enclose
some
filipino
revolutionary
postage
stamps
maybe
some
of
the
boys
would
like
them
have
you
made
up
your
mind
whether
you
would
like
to
try
shooting
the
third
week
in
august
or
the
last
week
in
july
or
would
you
rather
wait
until
you
come
back
when
i
can
find
out
something
more
definite
from
post
we
very
much
wished
for
you
while
we
were
at
the
buffalo
exposition
by
night
it
was
especially
beautiful
alice
and
i
also
wished
that
you
could
have
been
with
us
when
we
were
out
riding
at
geneseo
major
wadsworth
put
me
on
a
splendid
big
horse
called
triton
and
sister
on
a
thoroughbred
mare
they
would
jump
anything
it
was
sister
first
experience
but
she
did
splendidly
and
rode
at
any
fence
at
which
i
would
first
put
triton
i
did
not
try
anything
very
high
but
still
some
of
the
posts
and
rails
were
about
four
feet
high
and
it
was
enough
to
test
sister
seat
of
course
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
stick
on
as
the
horses
jumped
perfectly
and
enjoyed
it
quite
as
much
as
we
did
the
first
four
or
five
fences
that
i
went
over
i
should
be
ashamed
to
say
how
far
i
bounced
out
of
the
saddle
but
after
a
while
i
began
to
get
into
my
seat
again
it
has
been
a
good
many
years
since
i
have
jumped
a
fence
mother
stopped
off
at
albany
while
sister
went
on
to
boston
and
i
came
on
here
alone
tuesday
afternoon
gaudens
the
sculptor
and
dunne
dooley
were
on
the
train
and
took
lunch
with
us
it
was
great
fun
meeting
them
and
i
liked
them
both
kermit
met
me
in
high
feather
although
i
did
not
reach
the
house
until
ten
and
he
sat
by
me
and
we
exchanged
anecdotes
while
i
took
my
supper
ethel
had
put
an
alarm
clock
under
her
head
so
as
to
be
sure
and
wake
up
but
although
it
went
off
she
continued
to
slumber
profoundly
as
did
quentin
archie
waked
up
sufficiently
to
tell
me
that
he
had
found
another
turtle
just
as
small
as
the
already
existing
treasure
of
the
same
kind
this
morning
quentin
and
black
jack
have
neither
of
them
been
willing
to
leave
me
for
any
length
of
time
black
jack
simply
lies
curled
up
in
a
chair
but
as
quentin
is
most
conversational
he
has
added
an
element
of
harassing
difficulty
to
my
effort
to
answer
my
accumulated
correspondence
archie
announced
that
he
had
seen
the
baltimore
orioles
catching
fish
this
seemed
to
warrant
investigation
but
it
turned
out
he
meant
barn
swallows
skimming
the
water
the
president
not
only
sent
picture
letters
to
his
own
children
but
an
especial
one
to
miss
sarah
schuyler
butler
daughter
of
nicholas
murray
butler
president
of
columbia
university
who
had
written
to
him
a
little
note
of
congratulation
on
his
first
birthday
in
the
white
house
white
house
dear
little
miss
sarah
i
liked
your
birthday
note
much
and
my
children
say
i
should
draw
you
two
pictures
in
return
we
have
a
large
blue
macaw
quentin
calls
him
a
who
lives
in
the
greenhouse
and
is
very
friendly
but
makes
queer
noises
he
eats
bread
potatoes
and
coffee
grains
the
children
have
a
very
cunning
pony
he
is
a
little
pet
like
a
dog
but
he
plays
tricks
on
them
when
they
ride
him
he
bucked
ethel
over
his
head
the
other
day
your
father
will
tell
you
that
these
are
pictures
of
the
unpolished
stone
period

my
love
to
your

my
dear
harris
your
letter
was
a
great
relief
to
kermit
who
always
becomes
personally
interested
in
his
favorite
author
and
who
has
been
much
worried
by
your
sickness
he
would
be
more
than
delighted
with
a
copy
of
daddy
jake
alice
has
it
already
but
kermit
eagerly
wishes
it
last
night
roosevelt
and
i
were
sitting
out
on
the
porch
at
the
back
of
the
white
house
and
were
talking
of
you
and
wishing
you
could
be
sitting
there
with
us
it
is
delightful
at
all
times
but
i
think
especially
so
after
dark
the
monument
stands
up
distinct
but
not
quite
earthly
in
the
night
and
at
this
season
the
air
is
sweet
with
the
jasmine
and
honeysuckle
all
of
the
younger
children
are
at
present
absorbed
in
various
pets
perhaps
the
foremost
of
which
is
a
puppy
of
the
most
orthodox
puppy
type
then
there
is
jack
the
terrier
and
sailor
boy
the
chesapeake
bay
dog
and
eli
the
most
gorgeous
macaw
with
a
bill
that
i
think
could
bite
through
boiler
plate
who
crawls
all
over
ted
and
whom
i
view
with
dark
suspicion
and
jonathan
the
piebald
rat
of
most
friendly
and
affectionate
nature
who
also
crawls
all
over
everybody
and
the
flying
squirrel
and
two
kangaroo
rats
not
to
speak
of
pony
algonquin
who
is
the
most
absolute
pet
of
them
all
roosevelt
and
i
have
i
think
read
all
your
stories
to
the
children
and
some
of
them
over
and
over
again
the
dog

kermit

am
delighted
at
all
the
accounts
i
receive
of

to
be
enjoying
yourself
and
are
getting
on

she
told

emotion
at
such
generosity
almost
overcame
him
gem
is
really
a
very
nice
small
but
mother
found
that
in
this
case
possession
was
less
attractive
than
pursuit
when
she
takes
him
out
walking
he
carries
her
along
as
if
she
was
a
roman

she
thinks
that

wiggled
himself
into
a
fit
he

so
overjoyed
at
renewing
acquaintance

see
jack

tom

as
amusing
as
it
can
be
we
have
never
had
a
more
cunning
kitten
than
tom
quartz
i
have
just
had
to
descend
with
severity
upon
quentin
because
he
put
the
unfortunate
tom
into
the
bathtub
and
then
turned
on
the
water
he
did
really
mean
harm

evening

own
entire
family
party
all
the
lodges
and
their

i
had
a
lovely

washington
white

one
i
appreciated
more
than
yours
for
i
was
brought
up
to
admire
and
respect
your
grandfather
and
i
have
a
very
great
fondness
and
esteem
for
your
father
it
always
seems
to
me
as
if
you
children
were
being
brought
up
the
way
that
mine
are
yesterday
archie
got
among
his
presents
a
small
rifle
from
me
and
a
pair
of
from
his
mother
he
wo
be
able
to
use
the
rifle
until
next
summer
but
he
has
gone
off
very
happy
in
the
riding
boots
for
a
ride
on
the
calico
pony
algonquin
the
one
you
rode
the
other
day
yesterday
morning
at
a
quarter
of
seven
all
the
children
were
up
and
dressed
and
began
to
hammer
at
the
door
of
their
mother
and
my
room
in
which
their
six
stockings
all
bulging
out
with
queer
angles
and
rotundities
were
hanging
from
the
fireplace
so
their
mother
and
i
got
up
shut
the
window
lit
the
fire
taking
down
the
stockings
of
course
put
on
our
wrappers
and
prepared
to
admit
the
children
but
first
there
was
a
surprise
for
me
also
for
their
good
mother
for
archie
had
a
little
christmas
tree
of
his
own
which
he
had
rigged
up
with
the
help
of
one
of
the
carpenters
in
a
big
closet
and
we
all
had
to
look
at
the
tree
and
each
of
us
got
a
present
off
of
it
there
was
also
one
present
each
for
jack
the
dog
tom
quartz
the
kitten
and
algonquin
the
pony
whom
archie
would
no
more
think
of
neglecting
than
i
would
neglect
his
brothers
and
sisters
then
all
the
children
came
into
our
bed
and
there
they
opened
their
stockings
afterwards
we
got
dressed
and
took
breakfast
and
then
all
went
into
the
library
where
each
child
had
a
table
set
for
his
bigger
presents
quentin
had
a
perfectly
delightful
electric
railroad
which
had
been
rigged
up
for
him
by
one
of
his
friends
the
white
house
electrician
who
has
been
very
good
to
all
the
children
then
ted
and
i
with
general
wood
and
bob
ferguson
who
was
a
lieutenant
in
my
regiment
went
for
a
three
ride
and
all
of
us
including
all
the
children
took
lunch
at
the
house
with
the
children
aunt
captain
cowles
archie
and
quentin
having
their
lunch
at
a
little
table
with
their
cousin
sheffield
late
in
the
afternoon
i
played
at
single
stick
with
general
wood
and
ferguson
i
am
going
to
get
your
father
to
come
on
and
try
it
soon
we
have
to
try
to
hit
as
light
as
possible
but
sometimes
we
hit
hard
and
i
have
a
bump
over
one
eye
and
a
swollen
wrist
then
all
our
family
and
kinsfolk
and
senator
and
lodge
family
and
kinsfolk
had
our
christmas
dinner
at
the
white
house
and
afterwards
danced
in
the
east
room
closing
up
with
the
virginia
reel
tom
quartz
and
jack
white
house
dear
kermit
we
felt
very
melancholy
after
you
and
ted
left
and
the
house
seemed
empty
and
lonely
but
it
was
the
greatest
possible
comfort
to
feel
that
you
both
really
have
enjoyed
school
and
are
both
doing
well
there
tom
quartz
is
certainly
the
cunningest
kitten
i
have
ever
seen
he
is
always
playing
pranks
on
jack
and
i
get
very
nervous
lest
jack
should
grow
too
irritated
the
other
evening
they
were
both
in
the
library
jack
sleeping
before
the
fire
tom
quartz
scampering
about
an
exceedingly
playful
little
wild
creature
which
is
about
what
he
is
he
would
race
across
the
floor
then
jump
upon
the
curtain
or
play
with
the
tassel
suddenly
he
spied
jack
and
galloped
up
to
him
jack
looking
exceedingly
sullen
and
jumped
out
of
the
way
and
got
upon
the
sofa
where
tom
quartz
instantly
jumped
upon
him
again
jack
suddenly
shifted
to
the
other
sofa
where
tom
quartz
again
went
after
him
then
jack
started
for
the
door
while
tom
made
a
rapid
turn
under
the
sofa
and
around
the
table
and
just
as
jack
reached
the
door
leaped
on
his
jack
bounded
forward
and
away
and
the
two
went
tandem
out
of
the
room
jack
not
reappearing
at
all
and
after
about
five
minutes
tom
quartz
stalked
solemnly
back
another
evening
the
next
speaker
of
the
house
cannon
an
exceedingly
solemn
elderly
gentleman
with
chin
whiskers
who
certainly
does
not
look
to
be
of
playful
nature
came
to
call
upon
me
he
is
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
we
sat
talking
over
what
our
policies
for
the
session
should
be
until
about
eleven
and
when
he
went
away
i
accompanied
him
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
had
gone
about
down
when
tom
quartz
strolled
by
his
tail
erect
and
very
fluffy
he
spied
cannon
going
down
the
stairs
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
he
was
a
playmate
escaping
and
raced
after
him
suddenly
grasping
him
by
the
leg
the
way
he
does
archie
and
quentin
when
they
play
hide
and
seek
with
him
then
loosening
his
hold
he
tore
ahead
of
cannon
who
eyed
him
with
iron
calm
and
not
one
particle
of
surprise
ethel
has
reluctantly
gone
back
to
it
is
just
after
lunch
and
dulany
is
cutting
my
hair
while
i
dictate
this
to
loeb
i
left
mother
lying
on
the
sofa
and
reading
aloud
to
quentin
who
as
usual
has
hung
himself
over
the
back
of
the
sofa
in
what
i
should
personally
regard
as
an
exceedingly
uncomfortable
attitude
to
listen
to
literature
archie
we
shall
not
see
until
this
evening
when
he
will
suddenly
challenge
me
either
to
a
race
or
a
bear
play
and
if
neither
invitation
is
accepted
will
then
propose
that
i
tell
a
pig
story
or
else
read
aloud
from
the
norse
folk
tales
a
far
western
trip
in
april
president
roosevelt
made
a
trip
to
the
pacific
coast
visiting
yellowstone
park
and
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
tame
wild
creatures
yellowstone
park
wyoming
april
darling
ethel
i
wish
you
could
be
here
and
see
how
tame
all
the
wild
creatures
are
as
i
write
a
dozen
of
deer
have
come
down
to
the
parade
grounds
right
in
front
of
the
house
to
get
the
hay
they
are
all
looking
at
the
bugler
who
has
begun
to
play
the
retreat
western
customs
and
scenery
del
monte
may
darling
ethel
i
have
thought
it
very
good
of
you
to
write
me
so
much
of
course
i
am
feeling
rather
fagged
and
the
next
four
days
which
will
include
san
francisco
will
be
tiresome
but
i
am
very
well
this
is
a
beautiful
hotel
in
which
we
are
spending
sunday
with
gardens
and
a
long
drive
beside
the
beach
and
the
rocks
and
among
the
pines
and
cypresses
i
went
on
horseback
my
horse
was
a
little
beauty
spirited
swift
and
enduring
as
is
usually
the
case
here
they
had
a
great
deal
of
silver
on
the
bridle
and
headstall
and
much
carving
on
the
saddle
we
had
some
splendid
gallops
by
the
way
tell
mother
that
everywhere
out
here
from
the
mississippi
to
the
pacific
i
have
seen
most
of
the
girls
riding
astride
and
most
of
the
women
i
must
say
i
think
it
very
much
better
for
the
horses
backs
i
think
by
the
time
that
you
are
an
old
lady
the
will
almost
have
vanished
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
i
have
forgotten
whether
you
like
the
or
not
it
was
very
interesting
going
through
new
mexico
and
seeing
the
strange
old
civilization
of
the
desert
and
next
day
the
grand
canyon
of
arizona
wonderful
and
beautiful
beyond
description
i
could
have
sat
and
looked
at
it
for
days
it
is
a
tremendous
chasm
a
mile
deep
and
several
miles
wide
the
cliffs
carved
into
battlements
amphitheatres
towers
and
pinnacles
and
the
coloring
wonderful
red
and
yellow
and
gray
and
green
then
we
went
through
the
desert
passed
across
the
sierras
and
came
into
this
country
of
southern
california
with
palms
and
orange
groves
and
olive
orchards
and
immense
quantities
of
flowers
treasures
for
the
children
del
monte
may
blessed
kermit
the
last
weeks
travel
i
have
really
enjoyed
last
sunday
and
sunday
and
also
on
wednesday
at
the
grand
canyon
i
had
long
rides
and
the
country
has
been
strange
and
beautiful
i
have
collected
a
variety
of
treasures
which
i
shall
have
to
try
to
divide
up
equally
among
you
children
one
treasure
by
the
way
is
a
very
small
badger
which
i
named
josiah
and
he
is
now
called
josh
for
short
he
is
very
cunning
and
i
hold
him
in
my
arms
and
pet
him
i
hope
he
will
grow
up
friendly
that
is
if
the
poor
little
fellow
lives
to
grow
up
at
all
dulany
is
taking
excellent
care
of
him
and
we
feed
him
on
milk
and
potatoes
i
have
enjoyed
meeting
an
old
classmate
of
mine
at
harvard
he
was
heavyweight
boxing
champion
when
i
was
in
college
i
was
much
interested
in
your
seeing
the
wild
deer
that
was
quite
remarkable
by
the
way
as
i
rode
along
the
beach
i
saw
seals
cormorants
gulls
and
ducks
all
astonishingly
tame
more
treasures
del
monte
may
blessed
archie
i
think
it
was
very
cunning
for
you
and
quentin
to
write
me
that
letter
together
i
wish
you
could
have
been
with
me
on
algonquin
for
we
had
a
perfectly
lovely
ride
rixey
and
i
were
on
two
very
handsome
horses
with
mexican
saddles
and
bridles
the
reins
of
very
slender
leather
with
silver
rings
the
road
led
through
pine
and
cypress
forests
and
along
the
beach
the
surf
was
beating
on
the
rocks
in
one
place
and
right
between
two
of
the
rocks
where
i
really
did
not
see
how
anything
could
swim
a
seal
appeared
and
stood
up
on
his
tail
half
out
of
the
foaming
water
and
flapped
his
flippers
and
was
as
much
at
home
as
anything
could
be
beautiful
gulls
flew
close
to
us
all
around
and
cormorants
swam
along
the
breakers
or
walked
along
the
beach
i
have
a
number
of
treasures
to
divide
among
you
children
when
i
get
back
one
of
the
treasures
is
bill
the
lizard
he
is
a
little
live
lizard
called
a
horned
frog
very
cunning
who
lives
in
a
small
box
the
little
badger
josh
is
very
well
and
eats
milk
and
potatoes
we
took
him
out
and
gave
him
a
run
in
the
sand
so
far
he
seems
as
friendly
as
possible
when
he
feels
hungry
he
squeals
and
the
colored
porters
insist
that
he
says
because
dulany
is
very
good
to
him
and
takes
care
of
him
a
homesick
president
del
monte
may
dearest
i
loved
your
letter
i
am
very
homesick
for
mother
and
for
you
children
but
i
have
enjoyed
this
week
travel
i
have
been
among
the
orange
groves
where
the
trees
have
oranges
growing
thick
upon
them
and
there
are
more
flowers
than
you
have
ever
seen
i
have
a
gold
top
which
i
shall
give
you
if
mother
thinks
you
can
take
care
of
it
perhaps
i
shall
give
you
a
silver
bell
instead
whenever
i
see
a
little
boy
being
brought
up
by
his
father
or
mother
to
look
at
the
procession
as
we
pass
by
i
think
of
you
and
archie
and
feel
very
homesick
sometimes
little
boys
ride
in
the
procession
on
their
ponies

and
neatly
wrapped
them
up
in
white

were
for
the
most
part

as
tall
as
i
am
and
as
tough
and
wiry
as
you
can
imagine
he
is
a
really
good
rider
and
can
hold
his
own
in
walking
running
swimming
shooting
wrestling
and
boxing
kermit
is
as
cunning
as
ever
and
has
developed
greatly
he
and
his
inseparable
philip
started
out
for
a
night
camping
in
their
best
the
other
day
a
driving
storm
came
up
and
they
had
to
put
back
really
showing
both
pluck
skill
and
judgment
they
reached
home
after
having
been
out
twelve
hours
at
nine
in
the
evening
archie

devoted
to
algonquin
and
to
nicholas

playmates

george

who
is
in
princeton
and

off
on
long
expeditions
in
the
boats
has
cast
off
the
trammels
of
the
nursery
and
become
a
most
active
and
fearless
though
very
little
boy
really
the
children
do
have
an
ideal
time
out
here
and
it
is
an
ideal
place
for
them
the
three
sets
of
cousins
are
always
together
i
am
rather
disconcerted
by
the
fact
that
they
persist
in
regarding
me
as
a
playmate
this
afternoon
for
instance
was
rainy
and
all
of
them
from
george
ted
lorraine
and
ethel
down
to
archibald
nicholas
and
quentin
with
the
addition
of
aleck
russell
and
ensign
hamner
came
to
get
me
to
play
with
them
in
the
old
barn
they
plead
so
hard
that
i
finally
gave
in
but
upon
my
word
i
hardly
knew
whether
it
was
quite
right
for
the
president
to
be
engaged
in
such
wild
romping
as
the
next
two
hours
saw
the
barn
is
filled
with
hay
and
of
course
meets
every
requirement
for
the
most
active
species
of
and
the
like
quentin
enjoyed
the
game
as
much
as
any
one
and
would
jump
down
from
one
hay
level
to
another
fifteen
feet
below
with
complete
abandon
i
took
kermit
and
archie
with
philip
oliver
and
nicholas
out
for
a
night
camping
in
the
two
rowboats
last
week
they
enjoyed
themselves
heartily
as
usual
each
sleeping
rolled
up
in
his
blanket
and
all
getting
up
at
an
unearthly
hour
also
as
usual
they
displayed
a
touching
and
firm
conviction
that
my
cooking
is
unequalled
it
was
of
a
simple
character
consisting
of
frying
beefsteak
first
and
then
potatoes
in
bacon
fat
over
the
camp
fire
but
they
certainly
ate
in
a
way
that
showed
their
words
were
not
uttered
in
a
spirit
of
empty
compliment
a
president
at
play
to
miss
emily
carow
oyster
bay
archie
and
nick
continue
inseparable
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
them
the
other
day
after
one
of
the
picnics
walking
solemnly
up
jointly
carrying
a
basket
and
each
with
a
captured
turtle
in
his
disengaged
hand
archie
is
a
most
loving
cunning
little
goose
quentin
a
merry
soul
has
now
become
entirely
one
of
the
children
and
joins
heartily
in
all
their
plays
including
the
romps
in
the
old
barn
when
ethel
had
her
birthday
the
one
entertainment
for
which
she
stipulated
was
that
i
should
take
part
in
and
supervise
a
romp
in
the
old
barn
to
which
all
the
roosevelt
children
ensign
hamner
of
the
bob
ferguson
and
aleck
russell
were
to
come
of
course
i
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
but
really
it
seems
to
put
it
mildly
rather
odd
for
a
stout
elderly
president
to
be
bouncing
over
hayricks
in
a
wild
effort
to
get
to
goal
before
an
active
midget
of
a
competitor
aged
nine
years
however
it
was
really
great
fun
one
of
our
recent
picnics
was
an
innovation
due
to
edith
we
went
in
carriages
or
on
horseback
to
jane
hill
some
eight
miles
distant
the
view
was
lovely
and
there
was
a
delightful
old
farmhouse
half
a
mile
away
where
we
left
our
horses
speck
german
ambassador
count
speck
von
sternberg
rode
with
edith
and
me
looking
more
like
hans
christian
andersen
little
tin
soldier
than
ever
his
papers
as
ambassador
had
finally
come
and
so
he
had
turned
up
at
oyster
bay
together
with
the
acting
secretary
of
state
to
present
them
he
appeared
in
what
was
really
a
very
striking
costume
that
of
a
hussar
as
soon
as
the
ceremony
was
over
i
told
him
to
put
on
civilized
raiment
which
he
did
and
he
spent
a
couple
of
days
with
me
we
chopped
and
shot
and
rode
together
he
was
delighted
with
wyoming
and
as
always
was
extremely
nice
to
the
children
the
other
day
all
the
children
gave
amusing
amateur
theatricals
gotten
up
by
lorraine
and
ted
the
acting
was
upon
laura
roosevelt
tennis
court
all
the
children
were
most
cunning
especially
quentin
as
cupid
in
the
scantiest
of
pink
muslin
tights
and
bodice
ted
and
lorraine
who
were
respectively
george
washington
and
cleopatra
really
carried
off
the
play
at
the
end
all
the
cast
joined
hands
in
a
song
and
dance
the
final
verse
being
devoted
especially
to
me
i
love
all
these
children
and
have
great
fun
with
them
and
i
am
touched
by
the
way
in
which
they
feel
that
i
am
their
special
friend
champion
and
companion
all
young
and
old
from
the
three
houses
went
with
us
to
service
on
the
great
battleship
for
the
fleet
is
here
to
be
inspected
by
me
it
was
an
impressive
sight
one
which
i
think
the
children
will
not
soon
forget
most
of
the
boys
afterward
went
to
lunch
with
the
wretched
secretary
moody
on
the
ted
had
the
younger
ones
very
much
on
his
mind
and
when
he
got
back
said
they
had
been
altogether
too
much
like
a
march
hare
as
archie
nicholas
and
oliver
were
not
alive
to
the
dignity
of
the
occasion
to
ted
on
a
hunting
trip
oyster
bay
dear
ted
we
have
thought
of
you
a
good
deal
of
course
i
am
glad
you
have
my
rifle
with
you
you
scamp
does
it
still
have
those
associations
which
you
alleged
as
the
reason
why
you
would
value
it
so
much
when
in
the
near
future
i
became
unable
longer
to
use
it
i
do
not
have
very
much
hope
of
your
getting
a
great
deal
of
sport
on
this
trip
and
anything
you
do
get
in
the
way
of
furred
or
feathered
game
and
fishing
i
shall
count
as
so
much
extra
thrown
in
but
i
feel
the
trip
will
teach
you
a
lot
in
the
way
of
handling
yourself
in
a
wild
country
as
well
as
of
managing
horses
and
camp
outfits
of
dealing
with
frontiersmen
etc
it
will
therefore
fit
you
to
go
on
a
regular
camping
trip
next
time
i
have
sternly
refused
to
allow
mother
to
ride
wyoming
on
the
ground
that
i
would
not
have
her
make
a
martyr
of
herself
in
the
shape
of
riding
a
horse
with
a
gait
which
she
so
openly
detests
accordingly
i
have
had
some
long
and
delightful
rides
with
her
she
on
yagenka
and
i
on
bleistein
while
ethel
and
kermit
have
begun
to
ride
wyoming
kermit
was
with
us
this
morning
and
got
along
beautifully
till
we
galloped
whereupon
wyoming
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
a
race
and
kermit
for
a
moment
or
two
found
him
a
handful
on
sunday
after
we
came
back
from
church
and
bathed
i
rowed
mother
out
to
the
end
of
lloyds
neck
near
your
favorite
camping
ground
there
we
took
lunch
and
spent
a
couple
of
hours
with
our
books
reading
a
little
and
looking
out
over
the
beautiful
sound
and
at
the
headlands
and
white
beaches
of
the
coast
we
rowed
back
through
a
strange
shimmering
sunset
i
have
played
a
little
tennis
since
you
left
winty
chandler
beat
me
two
sets
but
i
beat
him

me
a
long
deuce
set

the
smaller
children

their
championship
nick
won
a
long
deuce
set
from
archie
and
to
my
surprise
oliver
and
ethel
beat
kermit
and
philip
in
two
straight
sets
i
officiated
as
umpire
and
furnished
the
prizes
which
were
penknives
end
of
summer
at
oyster
bay

very
empty

i
can
not
conscientiously

that
it
is

to
that

and
with
his
usual
faded

torn
and
patched

just
returned
from

ethel
and
i
insist
that
she
now
eyes
us
both
with
a
purely
professional
gaze
and
secretly
wishes
she
could
wrap
us
up
in

tell

that
quentin
is
now
going
to
the
public

as
yet
he
has
preserved
an
attitude
of
dignified
reserve
concerning
his
feelings
on
the
subject
he
has
just
been
presented
with
two
white
rabbits
which
he
brought
in
while
we
were
at
lunch
yesterday
explaining
that
they
were
the
valuablest
kind
with
pink

a
preaching
letter
white
house
dear
kermit
i
was
very
glad
to
get
your
letter
am
glad
you
are
playing
football
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
see
either
you
or
ted
devoting
most
of
your
attention
to
athletics
and
i
have
got
any
special
ambition
to
see
you
shine
overmuch
in
athletics
at
college
at
least
if
you
go
there
because
i
think
it
tends
to
take
up
too
much
time
but
i
do
like
to
feel
that
you
are
manly
and
able
to
hold
your
own
in
rough
hardy
sports
i
would
rather
have
a
boy
of
mine
stand
high
in
his
studies
than
high
in
athletics
but
i
could
a
great
deal
rather
have
him
show
true
manliness
of
character
than
show
either
intellectual
or
physical
prowess
and
i
believe
you
and
ted
both
bid
fair
to
develop
just
such
character
there
you
will
think
this
a
dreadfully
preaching
letter
i
suppose
i
have
a
natural
tendency
to
preach
just
at
present
because
i
am
overwhelmed
with
my
work
i
enjoy
being
president
and
i
like
to
do
the
work
and
have
my
hand
on
the
lever
but
it
is
very
worrying
and
puzzling
and
i
have
to
make
up
my
mind
to
accept
every
kind
of
attack
and
misrepresentation
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
read
the
life
and
letters
of
abraham
lincoln
i
am
more
and
more
impressed
every
day
not
only
with
the
man
wonderful
power
and
sagacity
but
with
his
literally
endless
patience
and
at
the
same
time
his
unflinching
resolution
proper
place
for
sports
white
house
dear
ted
in
spite
of
the
hurry
hurry
on
the
outside
of
your
envelope
i
did
not
like
to
act
until
i
had
consulted
mother
and
thought
the
matter
over
and
to
be
frank
with
you
old
fellow
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
i
am
doing
right
now
if
it
were
not
that
i
feel
you
will
be
so
bitterly
disappointed
i
would
strongly
advocate
your
acquiescing
in
the
decision
to
leave
you
off
the
second
squad
this
year
i
am
proud
of
your
pluck
and
i
greatly
admire
football
though
it
was
not
a
game
i
was
ever
able
to
play
myself
my
qualities
resembling
kermit
rather
than
yours
but
the
very
things
that
make
it
a
good
game
make
it
a
rough
game
and
there
is
always
the
chance
of
your
being
laid
up
now
i
should
not
in
the
least
object
to
your
being
laid
up
for
a
season
if
you
were
striving
for
something
worth
while
to
get
on
the
groton
school
team
for
instance
or
on
your
class
team
when
you
entered
harvard
for
of
course
i
think
you
will
have
the
weight
to
entitle
you
to
try
for
the
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
it
is
worth
your
while
to
run
the
risk
of
being
laid
up
for
the
sake
of
playing
in
the
second
squad
when
you
are
a
fourth
former
instead
of
when
you
are
a
fifth
former
i
do
not
know
that
the
risk
is
balanced
by
the
reward
however
i
have
told
the
rector
that
as
you
feel
so
strongly
about
it
i
think
that
the
chance
of
your
damaging
yourself
in
body
is
outweighed
by
the
possibility
of
bitterness
of
spirit
if
you
could
not
play
understand
me
i
should
think
mighty
little
of
you
if
you
permitted
chagrin
to
make
you
bitter
on
some
point
where
it
was
evidently
right
for
you
to
suffer
the
chagrin
but
in
this
case
i
am
uncertain
and
i
shall
give
you
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
if
however
the
coaches
at
any
time
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
ought
not
to
be
in
the
second
squad
why
you
must
come
off
without
grumbling
i
am
delighted
to
have
you
play
football
i
believe
in
rough
manly
sports
but
i
do
not
believe
in
them
if
they
degenerate
into
the
sole
end
of
any
one
existence
i
do
want
you
to
sacrifice
standing
well
in
your
studies
to
any
and
i
need
not
tell
you
that
character
counts
for
a
great
deal
more
than
either
intellect
or
body
in
winning
success
in
life
athletic
proficiency
is
a
mighty
good
servant
and
like
so
many
other
good
servants
a
mighty
bad
master
did
you
ever
read
pliny
letter
to
trajan
in
which
he
speaks
of
its
being
advisable
to
keep
the
greeks
absorbed
in
athletics
because
it
distracted
their
minds
from
all
serious
pursuits
including
soldiering
and
prevented
their
ever
being
dangerous
to
the
romans
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
the
british
officers
in
the
boer
war
had
their
efficiency
partly
reduced
because
they
had
sacrificed
their
legitimate
duties
to
an
inordinate
and
ridiculous
love
of
sports
a
man
must
develop
his
physical
prowess
up
to
a
certain
point
but
after
he
has
reached
that
point
there
are
other
things
that
count
more
in
my
regiment
of
the
men
were
better
horsemen
than
i
was
and
probably
of
them
better
shots
than
i
was
while
on
the
average
they
were
certainly
hardier
and
more
enduring
yet
after
i
had
had
them
a
very
short
while
they
all
knew
and
i
knew
too
that
nobody
else
could
command
them
as
i
could
i
am
glad
you
should
play
football
i
am
glad
that
you
should
box
i
am
glad
that
you
should
ride
and
shoot
and
walk
and
row
as
well
as
you
do
i
should
be
very
sorry
if
you
did
not
do
these
things
but
do
ever
get
into
the
frame
of
mind
which
regards
these
things
as
constituting
the
end
to
which
all
your
energies
must
be
devoted
or
even
the
major
portion
of
your
energies
yes
i
am
going
to
speak
at
groton
on
prize
day
i
felt
that
while
i
was
president
and
while
you
and
kermit
were
at
groton
i
wanted
to
come
up
there
and
see
you
and
the
rector
wished
me
to
speak
and
so
i
am
very
glad
to
accept
by
the
way
i
am
working
hard
to
get
renown
accustomed
to
automobiles
he
is
such
a
handful
now
when
he
meets
them
that
i
seriously
mind
encountering
them
when
mother
is
along
of
course
i
do
not
care
if
i
am
alone
or
with
another
man
but
i
am
uneasy
all
the
time
when
i
am
out
with
mother
yesterday
i
tried
bleistein
over
the
hurdles
at
chevy
chase
the
first
one
was
new
high
and
stiff
and
the
old
rascal
never
rose
six
inches
going
slap
through
it
i
took
him
at
it
again
and
he
went
over
all
right
i
am
very
busy
now
facing
the
usual
endless
worry
and
discouragement
and
trying
to
keep
steadily
in
mind
that
i
must
not
only
be
as
resolute
as
abraham
lincoln
in
seeking
to
achieve
decent
ends
but
as
patient
as
uncomplaining
and
as
in
dealing
not
only
with
knaves
but
with
the
foolish
people
educated
and
uneducated
who
by
their
unwisdom
give
the
knaves
their
chance
concerning
getting
smashed
white
house
dear
ted
i
have
received
letters
from
the
rector
from
woods
and
from
billings
they
all
say
that
you
should
play
on
the
third
squad
and
woods
says
you
are
now
satisfied
to
do
so
this
was
my
first
and
as
i
am
convinced
my
real
judgment
in
the
case
if
you
get
mashed
up
now
in
a
serious
way
it
may
prevent
your
playing
later
as
i
think
i
wrote
you
i
do
not
in
the
least
object
to
your
getting
smashed
if
it
is
for
an
object
that
is
worth
while
such
as
playing
on
the
groton
team
or
playing
on
your
class
team
when
you
get
to
harvard
but
i
think
it
a
little
silly
to
run
any
imminent
risk
of
a
serious
smash
simply
to
play
on
the
second
squad
instead
of
the
third
i
am
judging
for
you
as
i
would
for
myself
when
i
was
young
and
rode
across
country
i
was
light
and
tough
and
if
i
did
as
actually
happened
break
an
arm
or
a
rib
no
damage
ensued
and
no
scandal
was
caused
now
i
am
stiff
and
heavy
and
any
accident
to
me
would
cause
immense
talk
and
i
do
not
take
the
chance
simply
because
it
is
not
worth
while
on
the
other
hand
if
i
should
now
go
to
war
and
have
a
brigade
as
i
had
my
regiment
before
santiago
i
should
take
any
chance
that
was
necessary
because
it
would
be
worth
while
in
other
words
i
want
to
make
the
risk
to
a
certain
accident
commensurate
with
the
object
gained
the
art
of
uncle
remus
to
joel
chandler
harris
white
house
my
dear
harris
it
is
worth
while
being
president
when
one
small
daughter
receives
that
kind
of
an
autograph
gift
when
i
was
younger
than
she
is
my
aunt
annie
bulloch
of
georgia
used
to
tell
me
some
of
the
brer
rabbit
stories
especially
brer
rabbit
and
the
tar
baby
but
fond
though
i
am
of
the
brer
rabbit
stories
i
think
i
am
even
fonder
of
your
other
writings
i
doubt
if
there
is
a
more
genuinely
pathetic
tale
in
all
our
literature
than
free
joe
moreover
i
have
felt
that
all
that
you
write
serves
to
bring
our
people
closer
together
i
know
of
course
the
ordinary
talk
is
that
an
artist
should
be
judged
purely
by
his
art
but
i
am
rather
a
philistine
and
like
to
feel
that
the
art
serves
a
good
purpose
your
art
is
not
only
an
art
addition
to
our
sum
of
national
achievement
but
it
has
also
always
been
an
addition
to
the
forces
that
tell
for
decency
and
above
all
for
the
blotting
out
of
sectional
antagonism
a
ride
and
a
pillow
fight
white
house
dear
kermit
i
was
much
pleased
at
your
being
made
captain
of
your
eleven
i
would
rather
have
you
captain
of
the
third
eleven
than
playing
on
the
second
yesterday
afternoon
ethel
on
wyoming
mother
on
yagenka
and
i
on
renown
had
a
long
ride
the
only
incident
being
meeting
a
large
red
automobile
which
much
shook
renown
nerves
although
he
behaved
far
better
than
he
has
hitherto
been
doing
about
automobiles
in
fact
he
behaved
so
well
that
i
leaned
over
and
gave
him
a
lump
of
sugar
when
he
had
passed
the
object
of
terror
the
old
boy
eagerly
turning
his
head
around
to
get
it
it
was
lovely
out
in
the
country
with
the
trees
at
their
very
best
of
the
fall
coloring
there
are
no
red
maples
here
but
the
virginia
creepers
and
some
of
the
dogwoods
give
the
red
and
the
hickories
tulip
trees
and
beeches
a
brilliant
yellow
sometimes
almost
orange
when
we
got
home
mother
went
first
and
was
met
by
archie
and
quentin
each
loaded
with
pillows
and
whispering
not
to
let
me
know
that
they
were
in
ambush
then
as
i
marched
up
to
the
top
they
assailed
me
with
shrieks
and
chuckles
of
delight
and
then
the
pillow
fight
raged
up
and
down
the
hall
after
my
bath
i
read
them
from
uncle
remus
usually
mother
reads
them
but
now
and
then
when
i
think
she
really
must
have
a
holiday
from
it
i
read
them
myself
study
and
play
white
house
dear
ted
i
am
really
greatly
pleased
at
your
standing
so
high
in
your
form
and
i
am
sure
that
this
year
it
is
better
for
you
to
be
playing
where
you
are
in
football
i
suppose
next
year
you
will
go
back
to
your
position
of
end
as
you
would
hardly
be
heavy
enough
for
playing
back
or
to
play
behind
the
centre
against
teams
with
big
fellows
i
repeat
that
your
standing
in
the
class
gave
me
real
pleasure
i
have
sympathized
so
much
with
your
delight
in
physical
prowess
and
have
been
so
glad
at
the
success
you
have
had
that
sometimes
i
have
been
afraid
i
have
failed
to
emphasize
sufficiently
the
fact
that
of
course
one
must
not
subordinate
study
and
work
to
the
cultivation
of
such
prowess
by
the
way
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
am
falling
behind
physically
the
last
two
or
three
years
i
have
had
a
tendency
to
rheumatism
or
gout
or
something
of
the
kind
which
makes
me
very
stiff
renown
is
behaving
better
about
automobiles
and
the
like
i
think
the
difference
is
largely
in
the
way
i
handle
him
he
is
a
very
and
gentle
horse
but
timid
and
not
and
when
in
a
panic
his
great
strength
makes
him
uncontrollable
accordingly
he
is
a
bad
horse
to
try
to
force
by
anything
if
possible
it
is
much
better
to
give
him
a
little
time
and
bring
him
up
as
gently
as
may
be
to
the
object
of
terror
when
he
behaves
well
i
lean
forward
and
give
him
a
lump
of
sugar
and
now
the
old
boy
eagerly
puts
around
his
head
when
i
stretch
out
my
hand
bleistein
i
have
ridden
very
little
because
i
think
one
of
his
forelegs
is
shaky
and
i
want
to
spare
him
all
i
can
mother
and
i
have
had
the
most
lovely
rides
imaginable
quentin
first
fall
white
house
dear
kermit
yesterday
i
felt
rather
seedy
having
a
touch
of
cuban
fever
my
only
unpleasant
reminiscence
of
the
santiago
campaign
accordingly
i
spent
the
afternoon
in
the
house
lying
on
the
sofa
with
a
bright
fire
burning
and
mother
in
the
with
her
knitting
beside
me
i
felt
so
glad
that
i
was
not
out
somewhere
in
the
wilderness
campaigning
or
hunting
where
i
would
have
to
walk
or
ride
all
day
in
the
rain
and
then
lie
out
under
a
bush
at
night
when
allan
will
come
from
the
trainer
i
do
not
know
rather
to
my
surprise
ronald
has
won
golden
opinions
and
really
is
a
very
nice
dog
pinckney
loves
him
and
he
sits
up
in
the
express
wagon
just
as
if
it
was
what
he
had
been
born
to
quentin
is
learning
to
ride
the
pony
he
had
one
tumble
which
he
remarked
philosophically
did
not
hurt
him
any
more
than
when
i
whacked
him
with
a
sofa
cushion
in
one
of
our
pillow
fights
i
think
he
will
very
soon
be
able
to
manage
the
pony
by
himself
mother
has
just
taken
the
three
children
to
spend
the
afternoon
at
rixey
farm
i
am
hard
at
work
on
my
message
to
congress
and
accordingly
shall
not
try
to
go
out
or
see
any
one
either
this
afternoon
or
this
evening
all
of
this
work
is
terribly
puzzling
at
times
but
i
peg
away
at
it
and
every
now
and
then
when
the
dust
clears
away
and
i
look
around
i
feel
that
i
really
have
accomplished
a
little
at
any
rate
i
think
you
stood
well
in
your
form
taking
everything
into
account
i
feel
you
deserve
credit
for
being
captain
of
your
football
eleven
and
yet
standing
as
high
as
you
do
in
your
class

three
cheers
for
groton
it
was
on
election
day
i
saw
the
house
and
it
was
all
so
lovely
that
i
felt
fairly
homesick
to
be
back
in
it
the
japanese
maples
were
still
in
full
leaf
and
were
turning
the
most
beautiful
shades
of
scarlet
imaginable
the
old
barn
i
am
sorry
to
say
seems
to
be
giving
away
at
one

very
well
about

indeed
about
everything

of
being

for

go
when
you
get
on
here
for
the
christmas
holidays
you
will
have
to
try
them
both
for
if
there
is
any
fox
hunting
i
am
by
no
means
sure
you
will
find
it
better
to
take
bleistein
than
renown
sister

very
handsome
and
good
having
had
a
delightful
time
that
was
a
funny
trick
which
the
indians
played
against
harvard
harvard
did
well
to
play
such
a
successful
uphill
game
in
the
latter
part
of
the
second
half
as
to
enable
them
to
win
out
but
i
do
not
see
how
she
stands
a
chance
of
success

white
house
dear
kermit
while
i
was
preparing
to
dictate
a
message
to
congress
concerning
the
boiling
caldron
on
the
isthmus
of
panama
which
has
now
begun
to
bubble
over
up
came
one
of
the
ushers
with
a
telegram
from
you
and
ted
about
the
football
match
instantly
i
bolted
into
the
next
room
to
read
it
aloud
to
mother
and
sister
and
we
all
cheered
in
unison
when
we
came
to
the
rah
rah
rah
part
of
it
it
was
a
great
score
i
wish
i
could
have
seen
the
game
of
the
children
white
house
dear
kermit
did
i
tell
you
about
hector
brier
and
sailor
boy
dogs
when
i
saw
them
on
election
day
they
were
in
excellent
health
lying
around
the
door
of
seaman
house
which
they
had
evidently
adopted
as
their
own
sailor
boy
and
brier
were
exceedingly
affectionate
hector
kindly
but
uninterested
mother
has
gone
off
for
nine
days
and
as
usual
i
am
acting
as
archie
and
quentin
are
really
too
cunning
for
anything
each
night
i
spend
about
of
an
hour
reading
to
them
i
first
of
all
read
some
book
like
algonquin
indian
tales
or
the
poetry
of
scott
or
macaulay
once
i
read
them
jim
bludsoe
which
perfectly
enthralled
them
and
made
quentin
ask
me
at
least
a
hundred
questions
including
one
as
to
whether
the
colored
boy
did
not
find
sitting
on
the
safety
valve
hot
i
have
also
been
reading
them
each
evening
from
the
bible
it
has
been
the
story
of
saul
david
and
jonathan
they
have
been
so
interested
that
several
times
i
have
had
to
read
them
more
than
one
chapter
then
each
says
his
prayers
and
repeats
the
hymn
he
is
learning
quentin
usually
jigging
solemnly
up
and
down
while
he
repeats
it
each
finally
got
one
hymn
perfect
whereupon
in
accordance
with
previous
instructions
from
mother
i
presented
each
of
them
with
a
piece
yesterday
saturday
i
took
both
of
them
and
ethel
together
with
the
three
elder
garfield
boys
for
a
long
scramble
down
rock
creek
we
really
had
great
fun
quentin
sixth
birthday
white
house
dear
kermit
i
was
much
pleased
at
your
being
chosen
captain
of
the
seventh
i
had
not
expected
it
i
rather
suspect
that
you
will
be
behind
in
your
studies
this
month
if
so
try
to
make
up
next
month
and
keep
above
the
middle
of
the
class
if
you
can
i
am
interested
in
what
you
tell
me
about
the
sir
galahads
and
i
shall
want
to
talk
to
you
about
them
when
you
come
on
mother
is
back
with
aunt
emily
who
looks
very
well
it
is
so
nice
to
have
her
as
for
mother
of
course
she
makes
the
house
feel
like
a
home
again
instead
of
like
a
temporary
dwelling
leo
is
as
cunning
as
ever
pinckney
went
to
see
allan
yesterday
and
said
he
found
him
as
busy
as
a
bee
in
a
tar
barrel
and
evidently
owning
all
the
trainer
house
he
is
not
yet
quite
fit
to
come
back
here
is
quentin
birthday
he
has
a
cold
so
he
had
his
birthday
cake
with
the
six
candles
and
his
birthday
in
the
nursery
with
ethel
archie
mother
aunt
emily
myself
mame
and
georgette
as
admiring
guests
and
onlookers
a
president
poor
protection
white
house
dear
kermit
it
was
very
sad
at
uncle
gracie
funeral
and
yet
lovely
too
in
a
way
for
not
only
all
his
old
friends
had
turned
out
but
all
of
the
people
connected
with
the
institutions
for
which
he
had
worked
during
so
many
years
also
came
there
were
a
good
many
of
the
older
boys
and
employees
from
the
newsboys
lodging
house
and
the
orthopaedic
dispensary
etc
uncle
jimmy
possessed
a
singularly
loving
and
affectionate
nature
and
i
never
knew
any
one
who
in
doing
good
was
more
careful
to
do
it
unostentatiously
i
had
no
idea
how
much
he
had
done
mother
with
her
usual
thoughtfulness
had
kept
him
steadily
in
mind
while
i
have
been
governor
and
president
and
i
now
find
that
he
appreciated
her
so
much
her
constant
remembrances
in
having
him
on
to
visit
us
on
different
occasions
it
was
a
lesson
to
me
for
i
should
probably
never
have
thought
of
it
myself
and
of
course
when
one
does
not
do
what
one
ought
to
the
excuse
that
one
erred
from
thoughtlessness
instead
of
wrong
purpose
is
of
small
avail
the
police
arrangements
at
the
church
were
exasperating
to
a
degree
there
were
fully
five
hundred
policemen
in
the
streets
round
about
just
as
if
there
was
danger
of
an
attack
by
a
ferocious
mob
and
yet
though
they
had
throngs
of
policemen
inside
too
an
elderly
and
harmless
crank
actually
got
inside
with
them
to
present
me
some
foolish
memorial
about
curing
the
german
emperor
from
cancer
inasmuch
as
what
we
needed
was
not
protection
against
a
mob
but
a
sharp
lookout
for
cranks
the
arrangement
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
for
fifty
policemen
outside
and
two
or
three
good
detectives
inside
i
felt
like
a
fool
with
all
the
policemen
in
solemn
and
purposeless
lines
around
about
and
then
i
felt
half
exasperated
and
half
amused
when
i
found
that
they
were
utterly
helpless
to
prevent
a
crank
from
getting
inside
after
all
i
enclose
two
original
poems
by
nick
and
archie
they
refer
to
a
bit
of
unhappy
advice
i
gave
them
because
of
which
i
fell
into
richly
merited
disgrace
with
mother
nick
has
been
spending
three
days
or
so
with
archie
and
i
suggested
that
they
should
explore
the
white
house
in
the
mirk
of
midnight
they
did
in
white
sheets
and
like
little
jacks
barefooted
send
me
back
the
poems
ted
sprained
ankle
white
house
dear
ted
if
i
were
you
i
should
certainly
get
the
best
ankle
support
possible
you
do
not
want
to
find
next
fall
that
webb
beats
you
for
end
because
your
ankle
gives
out
and
his
does
not
if
i
were
in
your
place
if
it
were
necessary
i
should
put
the
ankle
in
plaster
for
the
next
three
weeks
or
for
as
long
as
the
doctor
thinks
it
needful
rather
than
run
any
risk
of
this
at
any
rate
i
would
consult
him
and
wear
whatever
he
thinks
is
the
right
thing
i
wonder
if
you
are
old
enough
yet
to
care
for
a
good
history
of
the
american
revolution
if
so
i
think
i
shall
give
you
mine
by
sir
george
trevelyan
although
it
is
by
an
englishman
i
really
think
it
on
the
whole
the
best
account
i
have
read
if
i
give
it
to
you
you
must
be
very
careful
of
it
because
he
sent
it
to
me
himself
the
bond
parrot
for
mother
has
turned
up
it
is
a
most
meritorious
parrot
very
friendly
and
quite
a
remarkable
talker
the
supreme
christmas
joy
to
his
sister
douglas
robinson
white
house
we
had
a
delightful
christmas
yesterday
just
such
a
christmas
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
we
used
to
have
under
father
and
mother
supervision
in
street
and
street
at
seven
all
the
children
came
in
to
open
the
big
bulgy
stockings
in
our
bed
kermit
terrier
allan
a
most
friendly
little
dog
adding
to
the
children
delight
by
occupying
the
middle
of
the
bed
from
alice
to
quentin
each
child
was
absorbed
in
his
or
her
stocking
and
edith
certainly
managed
to
get
the
most
wonderful
stocking
toys
bob
was
in
looking
on
and
aunt
emily
of
course
then
after
breakfast
we
all
formed
up
and
went
into
the
library
where
bigger
toys
were
on
separate
tables
for
the
children
i
wonder
whether
there
ever
can
come
in
life
a
thrill
of
greater
exaltation
and
rapture
than
that
which
comes
to
one
between
the
ages
of
say
six
and
fourteen
when
the
library
door
is
thrown
open
and
you
walk
in
to
see
all
the
gifts
like
a
materialized
fairy
land
arrayed
on
your
special
table
a
day
with
a
juggler
white
house
dear
kermit
thursday
and
friday
there
was
a
great
deal
of
snow
on
the
ground
and
the
weather
was
cold
so
that
mother
and
i
had
two
delightful
rides
up
rock
creek
the
horses
were
clipped
and
fresh
and
we
were
able
to
let
them
go
along
at
a
gallop
while
the
country
was
wonderfully
beautiful
after
lunch
mother
took
ethel
archie
and
quentin
each
with
a
friend
to
see
some
most
wonderful
juggling
and
sleight
of
hand
tricks
by
kellar
i
went
along
and
was
as
much
interested
as
any
of
the
children
though
i
had
to
come
back
to
my
work
in
the
office
before
it
was
half
through
at
one
period
ethel
gave
up
her
ring
for
one
of
the
tricks
it
was
mixed
up
with
the
rings
of
five
other
little
girls
and
then
all
six
rings
were
apparently
pounded
up
and
put
into
a
pistol
and
shot
into
a
collection
of
boxes
where
five
of
them
were
subsequently
found
each
tied
around
a
rose
ethel
however
had
disappeared
and
he
made
believe
that
it
had
vanished
but
at
the
end
of
the
next
trick
a
remarkable
bottle
out
of
which
many
different
liquids
had
been
poured
suddenly
developed
a
delightful
white
guinea
pig
squirming
and
kicking
and
looking
exactly
like
admiral
dewey
with
around
its
neck
ring
tied
by
a
pink
ribbon
then
it
was
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
handed
to
ethel
and
when
ethel
opened
it
behold
there
was
no
guinea
pig
but
a
bunch
of
roses
with
a
ring
merits
of
military
and
civil
life
white
house
dear
ted
this
will
be
a
long
business
letter
i
sent
to
you
the
examination
papers
for
west
point
and
annapolis
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
over
the
matter
and
discussed
it
at
great
length
with
mother
i
feel
on
the
one
hand
that
i
ought
to
give
you
my
best
advice
and
yet
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
to
constrain
you
against
your
wishes
if
you
have
definitely
made
up
your
mind
that
you
have
an
overmastering
desire
to
be
in
the
navy
or
the
army
and
that
such
a
career
is
the
one
in
which
you
will
take
a
really
interest
far
more
so
than
any
other
and
that
your
greatest
chance
for
happiness
and
usefulness
will
lie
in
doing
this
one
work
to
which
you
feel
yourself
especially
drawn
why
under
such
circumstances
i
have
but
little
to
say
but
i
am
not
satisfied
that
this
is
really
your
feeling
it
seemed
to
me
more
as
if
you
did
not
feel
drawn
in
any
other
direction
and
wondered
what
you
were
going
to
do
in
life
or
what
kind
of
work
you
would
turn
your
hand
to
and
wondered
if
you
could
make
a
success
or
not
and
that
you
are
therefore
inclined
to
turn
to
the
navy
or
army
chiefly
because
you
would
then
have
a
definite
and
settled
career
in
life
and
could
hope
to
go
on
steadily
without
any
great
risk
of
failure
now
if
such
is
your
thought
i
shall
quote
to
you
what
captain
mahan
said
of
his
son
when
asked
why
he
did
not
send
him
to
west
point
or
annapolis
i
have
too
much
confidence
in
him
to
make
me
feel
that
it
is
desirable
for
him
to
enter
either
branch
of
the
service
i
have
great
confidence
in
you
i
believe
you
have
the
ability
and
above
all
the
energy
the
perseverance
and
the
common
sense
to
win
out
in
civil
life
that
you
will
have
some
hard
times
and
some
discouraging
times
i
have
no
question
but
this
is
merely
another
way
of
saying
that
you
will
share
the
common
lot
though
you
will
have
to
work
in
different
ways
from
those
in
which
i
worked
you
will
not
have
to
work
any
harder
nor
to
face
periods
of
more
discouragement
i
trust
in
your
ability
and
especially
your
character
and
i
am
confident
you
will
win
in
the
army
and
the
navy
the
chance
for
a
man
to
show
great
ability
and
rise
above
his
fellows
does
not
occur
on
the
average
more
than
once
in
a
generation
when
i
was
down
at
santiago
it
was
melancholy
for
me
to
see
how
fossilized
and
lacking
in
ambition
and
generally
useless
were
most
of
the
men
of
my
age
and
over
who
had
served
their
lives
in
the
army
the
navy
for
the
last
few
years
has
been
better
but
for
twenty
years
after
the
civil
war
there
was
less
chance
in
the
navy
than
in
the
army
to
practise
and
do
work
of
real
consequence
i
have
actually
known
lieutenants
in
both
the
army
and
the
navy
who
were
grandfathers
men
who
had
seen
their
children
married
before
they
themselves
attained
the
grade
of
captain
of
course
the
chance
may
come
at
any
time
when
the
man
of
west
point
or
annapolis
who
will
have
stayed
in
the
army
or
navy
finds
a
great
war
on
and
therefore
has
the
opportunity
to
rise
high
under
such
circumstances
i
think
that
the
man
of
such
training
who
has
actually
left
the
army
or
the
navy
has
even
more
chance
of
rising
than
the
man
who
has
remained
in
it
moreover
often
a
man
can
do
as
i
did
in
the
spanish
war
even
though
not
a
west
pointer
this
last
point
raises
the
question
about
you
going
to
west
point
or
annapolis
and
leaving
the
army
or
navy
after
you
have
served
the
regulation
four
years
i
think
that
is
the
number
after
graduation
from
the
academy
under
this
plan
you
would
have
an
excellent
education
and
a
grounding
in
discipline
and
in
some
ways
a
testing
of
your
capacity
greater
than
i
think
you
can
get
in
any
ordinary
college
on
the
other
hand
except
for
the
profession
of
an
engineer
you
would
have
had
nothing
like
special
training
and
you
would
be
so
ordered
about
and
arranged
for
that
you
would
have
less
independence
of
character
than
you
could
gain
from
them
you
would
have
had
fewer
temptations
but
you
would
have
had
less
chance
to
develop
the
qualities
which
overcome
temptations
and
show
that
a
man
has
individual
initiative
supposing
you
entered
at
seventeen
with
the
intention
of
following
this
course
the
result
would
be
that
at
you
would
leave
the
army
or
navy
without
having
gone
through
any
law
school
or
any
special
technical
school
of
any
kind
and
would
start
your
life
work
three
or
four
years
later
than
your
schoolfellows
of
who
go
to
work
immediately
after
leaving
college
of
course
under
such
circumstances
you
might
study
law
for
instance
during
the
four
years
after
graduation
but
my
own
feeling
is
that
a
man
does
good
work
chiefly
when
he
is
in
something
which
he
intends
to
make
his
permanent
work
and
in
which
he
is
deeply
interested
moreover
there
will
always
be
the
chance
that
the
number
of
officers
in
the
army
or
navy
will
be
deficient
and
that
you
would
have
to
stay
in
the
service
instead
of
getting
out
when
you
wished
i
want
you
to
think
over
all
these
matters
very
seriously
it
would
be
a
great
misfortune
for
you
to
start
into
the
army
or
navy
as
a
career
and
find
that
you
had
mistaken
your
desires
and
had
gone
in
without
really
weighing
the
matter
you
ought
not
to
enter
unless
you
feel
genuinely
drawn
to
the
life
as
a
if
so
go
in
but
not
otherwise
loeb
told
me
that
at
he
had
tried
for
the
army
but
failed
the
competitor
who
beat
him
in
is
now
a
captain
loeb
has
passed
him
by
although
meanwhile
a
war
has
been
fought
loeb
says
he
wished
to
enter
the
army
because
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
could
not
foresee
whether
he
would
succeed
or
fail
in
life
and
felt
the
army
would
give
him
a
living
and
a
career
now
if
this
is
at
bottom
your
feeling
i
should
advise
you
not
to
go
in
i
should
say
yes
to
some
boys
but
not
to
you
i
believe
in
you
too
much
and
have
too
much
confidence
in
you
root
and
taft
white
house
dear
ted
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
you
were
to
be
confirmed
secretary
root
left
on
monday
and
governor
taft
took
his
place
i
have
missed
and
shall
miss
root
dreadfully
he
has
been
the
ablest
most
generous
and
most
disinterested
friend
and
adviser
that
any
president
could
hope
to
have
and
immediately
after
leaving
he
rendered
me
a
great
service
by
a
speech
at
the
union
league
club
in
which
he
said
in
most
effective
fashion
the
very
things
i
should
have
liked
him
to
say
and
his
words
moreover
carried
weight
as
the
words
of
no
other
man
at
this
time
addressing
such
an
audience
could
have
done
taft
is
a
splendid
fellow
and
will
be
an
aid
and
comfort
in
every
way
but
as
mother
says
he
is
too
much
like
me
to
be
able
to
give
me
as
good
advice
as
root
was
able
to
do
because
of
the
very
differences
of
character
between
us
if
after
fully
thinking
the
matter
over
you
remain
firmly
convinced
that
you
want
to
go
into
the
army
well
and
good
i
shall
be
rather
sorry
for
your
decision
because
i
have
great
confidence
in
you
and
i
believe
that
in
civil
life
you
could
probably
win
in
the
end
a
greater
prize
than
will
be
open
to
you
if
you
go
into
the
army
though
of
course
a
man
can
do
well
in
the
army
i
know
perfectly
well
that
you
will
have
hard
times
in
civil
life
probably
most
young
fellows
when
they
have
graduated
from
college
or
from
their
course
if
they
take
any
feel
pretty
dismal
for
the
first
few
years
in
ordinary
cases
it
at
first
seems
as
if
their
efforts
were
not
leading
anywhere
as
if
the
pressure
around
the
foot
of
the
ladder
was
too
great
to
permit
of
getting
up
to
the
top
but
i
have
faith
in
your
energy
your
perseverance
your
ability
and
your
power
to
force
yourself
to
the
front
when
you
have
once
found
out
and
taken
your
line
however
you
and
i
and
mother
will
talk
the
whole
matter
over
when
you
come
back
here

death

dear
ted
poor
hanna
death
was
a
tragedy
at
the
end
he
wrote
me
a
note
the
last
he
ever
wrote
which
showed
him
at
his
best
and
which
i
much
appreciate
his
death
was
very
sad
for
his
family
and
close
friends
for
he
had
many
large
and
generous
traits
and
had
made
a
great
success
in
life
by
his
energy
perseverance
and
burly
strength

has
always
been
a
great
friend
of
mine
i
remember
when
i
was
running
for

struck
a
kansas
town
just
when
the
wild
west
show
was
there
he
got
upon
the

and
made
a
brief
speech
on
my
behalf
ending
with
the
statement
that
a

from
the

had
come
no

the

hunted
their

as
for
you
i
think
the
west

education
is
of
course
good
for
any
man
but
i
still
think
that
you
have
too
much
in
you
for
me
to
be
glad
to
see
you
go
into
the
army

in
time

is
so
much
a

dear
kermit
mother
went
off
for
three
days
to
new
york
and
mame
and
quentin
took
instant
advantage
of
her
absence
to
fall
sick
quentin
sickness
was
surely
due
to
a
riot
in
candy
and
with
chocolate
sauce
he
was
a
very
sad
bunny
next
morning
and
spent
a
couple
of
days
in
bed
ethel
as
always
was
as
good
as
gold
both
to
him
and
to
archie
and
largely
relieved
me
of
my
duties
as
i
got
up
each
morning
in
time
to
breakfast
with
ethel
and
archie
before
they
started
for
school
and
i
read
a
certain
amount
to
quentin
but
this
was
about
all
i
think
archie
escaped
with
a
minimum
of
washing
for
the
three
days
one
day
i
asked
him
before
quentin
how
often
he
washed
his
face
whereupon
quentin
interpolated
very
seldom
i

which
naturally
produced
from
archie
violent
recriminations

japanese
wrestling
white
house
march
dear
kermit
i
am
wrestling
with
two
japanese
wrestlers
three
times
a
week
i
am
not
the
age
or
the
build
one
would
think
to
be
whirled
lightly
over
an
opponent
head
and
batted
down
on
a
mattress
without
damage
but
they
are
so
skilful
that
i
have
not
been
hurt
at
all
my
throat
is
a
little
sore
because
once
when
one
of
them
had
a
strangle
hold
i
also
got
hold
of
his
windpipe
and
thought
i
could
perhaps
choke
him
off
before
he
could
choke
me
however
he
got
ahead
white
house
april
dear
ted
i
am
very
glad
i
have
been
doing
this
japanese
wrestling
but
when
i
am
through
with
it
this
time
i
am
not
at
all
sure
i
shall
ever
try
it
again
while
i
am
so
busy
with
other
work
as
i
am
now
often
by
the
time
i
get
to
five
in
the
afternoon
i
will
be
feeling
like
a
stewed
owl
after
an
eight
hours
grapple
with
senators
congressmen
etc
then
i
find
the
wrestling
a
trifle
too
vehement
for
mere
rest
my
right
ankle
and
my
left
wrist
and
one
thumb
and
both
great
toes
are
swollen
sufficiently
to
more
or
less
impair
their
usefulness
and
i
am
well
mottled
with
bruises
elsewhere
still
i
have
made
good
progress
and
since
you
left
they
have
taught
me
three
new
throws
that
are
perfect
corkers

for

white

may
dear
ted
i
am
having
a
reasonable
amount
of
work
and
rather
more
than
a
reasonable
amount
of
worry
but
after
all
life
is
lovely
here
the
country
is
beautiful
and
i
do
not
think
that
any
two

ever
got
more
enjoyment
out
of
the
white
house
than
mother
and
i
we
love
the
house
itself
without
and
within
for
its
associations
for
its
stillness
and
its
simplicity
we
love
the
garden
and
we
like
washington
we
almost
always
take
our
breakfast
on
the
south
portico
now
mother
looking
very
pretty
and
dainty
in
her
summer
dresses
then
we
stroll
about
the
garden
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
looking
at
the
flowers
and
the
fountain
and
admiring
the
trees
then
i
work
until
between
four
and
five
usually
having
some
official
people
to
lunch
now
a
couple
of
senators
now
a
couple
of
ambassadors
now
a
literary
man
now
a
capitalist
or
a
labor
leader
or
a
scientist
or
a
hunter
if
mother
wants
to
ride
we
then
spend
a
couple
of
hours
on
horseback
we
had
a
lovely
ride
up
on
the
virginia
shore
since
i
came
back
and
yesterday
went
up
rock
creek
and
swung
back
home
by
the
roads
where
the
locust
trees
were
most
numerous
for
they
are
now
white
with
blossoms
it
is
the
last
great
burst
of
bloom
which
we
shall
see
this
year
except
the
laurels
but
there
are
plenty
of
flowers
in
bloom
or
just
coming
out
the
honeysuckle
most
conspicuously
the
south
portico
is
fragrant
with
that
now
the
jasmine
will
be
out
later
if
we
ride
i
walk

other
day
while
walking
with
pinchot
and
garfield
we
climbed
into
the
blagden
deer
park
and
almost
walked
over
such
a
pretty
wee
fawn
all
spotted
it
ran
off
like
a
little
race
horse
it
made
great
jumps
and
held
its
white
tail
straight
in
the
air
white

june
dear
the
other
day
when
out
riding
what
should
i
see
in
the
road
ahead
of
me
but
a
real
terrapin
and
rabbit
they
were
sitting
solemnly
beside
one
another
and
looked
just
as
if
they
had
come
out
of
a
book
but
as
my
horse
walked
along
rabbit
went
lippity
lippity
lippity
off
into
the
bushes
and
terrapin
drew
in
his
head
and
legs
till
i
passed
charms
of
valley
forge
white
house
june
dearest
ethel
i
think
you
are
a
little
trump
and
i
love
your
letter
and
the
way
you
take
care
of
the
children
and
keep
down
the
expenses
and
cook
bread
and
are
just
your
own
blessed
busy
cunning
self
you
would
have
enjoyed
being
at
valley
forge
with
us
on
sunday
it
is
a
beautiful
place
and
of
course
full
of
historic
associations
the
garden
here
is
lovely
a
pair
of
warbling
vireos
have
built
in
a
linden
and
sing
all
the
time
the
lindens
by
the
way
are
in
bloom
and
massachusetts
avenue
is
fragrant
with
them
the
magnolias
are
all
in
bloom
too
and
the
jasmine
on
the
porch
washington
companions
at
valley
forge
white
house
june
dear
ted
mother
and
i
had
a
most
lovely
ride
the
other
day
way
up
beyond
sligo
creek
to
what
is
called
branch
at
burnt
mills
where
is
a
beautiful
gorge
deep
and
narrow
with
great
boulders
and
even
cliffs
excepting
great
falls
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
around
here
mother
scrambled
among
the
cliffs
in
her
riding
habit
very
pretty
and
most
interesting
the
roads
were
good
and
some
of
the
scenery
really
beautiful
we
were
gone
four
hours
half
an
hour
being
occupied
with
the
scrambling
in
the
gorge
saturday
we
went
to
the
wedding
of
teddy
douglas
and
helen
it
was
a
beautiful
wedding
in
every
way
and
i
am
very
fond
of
both
of
them
sunday
we
spent
at
knox
at
valley
forge
and
most
unexpectedly
i
had
to
deliver
a
little
address
at
the
church
in
the
afternoon
as
they
are
trying
to
build
a
memorial
to
washington
think
of
the
fact
that
in
washington
army
that
winter
among
the
junior
officers
were
alexander
hamilton
monroe
and
marshall
a
future
president
of
the
united
states
the
future
chief
justice
who
was
to
do
such
wonderful
work
for
our
government
and
the
man
of
most
brilliant
mind
hamilton
whom
we
have
ever
developed
in
this
country
on
the
eve
of
nomination
for
president
white
house
june
dear
kermit
we
spent
at
the
knoxes
it
is
a
beautiful
farm
just
such
a
one
as
you
could
run
phil
knox
as
capable
and
efficient
as
he
is
diminutive
amused
mother
and
me
greatly
by
the
silent
way
in
which
he
did
in
way
his
full
share
of
all
the
work
the
national
convention
meets
and
barring
a
cataclysm
i
shall
be
nominated
there
is
a
great
deal
of
sullen
grumbling
but
it
has
taken
more
the
form
of
resentment
against
what
they
think
is
my
dictation
as
to
details
than
against
me
personally
they
do
dare
to
oppose
me
for
the
nomination
and
i
suppose
it
is
hardly
likely
the
attempt
will
be
made
to
stampede
the
convention
for
any
one
how
the
election
will
turn
out
no
man
can
tell
of
course
i
hope
to
be
elected
but
i
realize
to
the
full
how
very
lucky
i
have
been
not
only
to
be
president
but
to
have
been
able
to
accomplish
so
much
while
president
and
whatever
may
be
the
outcome
i
am
not
only
content
but
very
sincerely
thankful
for
all
the
good
fortune
i
have
had
from
panama
down
i
have
been
able
to
accomplish
certain
things
which
will
be
of
lasting
importance
in
our
history
incidentally
i
do
think
that
any
family
has
ever
enjoyed
the
white
house
more
than
we
have
i
was
thinking
about
it
just
this
morning
when
mother
and
i
took
breakfast
on
the
portico
and
afterwards
walked
about
the
lovely
grounds
and
looked
at
the
stately
historic
old
house
it
is
a
wonderful
privilege
to
have
been
here
and
to
have
been
given
the
chance
to
do
this
work
and
i
should
regard
myself
as
having
a
small
and
mean
mind
if
in
the
event
of
defeat
i
felt
soured
at
not
having
had
more
instead
of
being
thankful
for
having
had
so
much
picture
letter
white

blessed
archikins
the
other
day
when
mother
and
i
were
walking
down
the
steps
of
the
big
south
porch
we
saw
a
movement
among
the
honeysuckles
and
there
was
bill
the
lizard
your
lizard
that
you
brought
home
from
mount
vernon
we
have
seen
him
several
times
since
and
he
is
evidently
entirely
at
home
here
the
white
house
seems
big
and
empty
without
any
of
you
children
puttering
around
it
and
i
think
the
ushers
miss
you
very
much
i
play
tennis
in
the
late
afternoons
unless
i
go
to
ride
with

on

white
house
darling
kermit
the
weather
has
been
beautiful
the
last
week
mild
and
yet
with
the
true
feeling
of
fall
in
the
air
when
mother
and
i
have
ridden
up
rock
creek
through
the
country
round
about
it
has
been
a
perpetual
delight
just
to
look
at
the
foliage
i
have
never
seen
leaves
turn
more
beautifully
the
virginia
creepers
and
some
of
the
maple
and
gum
trees
are
scarlet
and
crimson
the
oaks
are
deep
red
brown
the
beeches
birches
and
hickories
are
brilliant
saffron
just
at
this
moment
i
am
dictating
while
on
my
way
with
mother
to
the
wedding
of
senator
daughter
and
the
country
is
a
blaze
of
color
as
we
pass
through
it
so
that
it
is
a
joy
to
the
eye
to
look
upon
it
i
do
not
think
i
have
ever
before
seen
the
colorings
of
the
woods
so
beautiful
so
far
south
as
this
ted
is
hard
at
work
with
matt
hale
who
is
a
very
nice
fellow
and
has
become
quite
one
of
the
household
like
good
mademoiselle
i
am
really
fond
of
her
she
is
so
bright
and
amusing
and
now
seems
perfectly
happy
and
is
not
only
devoted
to
archie
and
quentin
but
is
very
wise
in
the
way
she
takes
care
of
them
quentin
under
parental
duress
rides
algonquin
every
day
archie
has
just
bought
himself
a
football
suit
but
i
have
not
noticed
that
he
has
played
football
as
yet
he
is
spending
saturday
and
sunday
out
at
rixey
ted
plays
tennis
with
matt
hale
and
me
and
cooley
we
tied
dan
moore
you
could
beat
him
yesterday
i
took
an
afternoon
off
and
we
all
went
for
a
scramble
and
climb
down
the
other
side
of
the
potomac
from
chain
bridge
home
it
was
great
fun
sunday
we
shall
have
lunch
early
and
spend
the
afternoon
in
a
drive
of
the
entire
family
including
ethel
but
not
including
archie
and
quentin
out
to
burnt
mills
and
back
when
i
say
we
all
scrambled
along
the
potomac
i
of
course
only
meant
matt
hale
and
ted
and
i
three
or
four
active
male
friends
took
the
walk
with
us
in
politics
things
at
the
moment
seem
to
look
quite
right
but
every
form
of
lie
is
being
circulated
by
the
democrats
and
they
intend
undoubtedly
to
spring
all
kinds
of
sensational
untruths
at
the
very
end
of
the
campaign
i
have
not
any
idea
whether
we
will
win
or
not
before
election
i
shall
send
you
my
guess
as
to
the
way
the
different
states
will
vote
and
then
you
can
keep
it
and
see
how
near
to
the
truth
i
come
but
of
course
you
will
remember
that
it
is
a
mere
guess
and
that
i
may
be
utterly
mistaken
all
along
the
line
in
any
event
even
if
i
am
beaten
you
must
remember
that
we
have
had
three
years
of
great
enjoyment
out
of
the
presidency
and
that
we
are
mighty
lucky
to
have
had
them
i
generally
have
people
in
to
lunch
but
at
dinner
thank
fortune
we
are
usually
alone
though
i
have
callers
in
the
evening
i
generally
have
an
hour
in
which
to
sit
with
mother
and
the
others
up
in
the
library
talking
and
reading
and
watching
the
bright
wood
fire
ted
and
ethel
as
well
as
archie
and
quentin
are
generally
in
mother
room
for
twenty
minutes
or
a
half
hour
just
before
she
dresses
according
to
immemorial
custom
last
evening
mother
and
i
and
ted
and
ethel
and
matt
hale
went
to
the
theatre
to
see
the
yankee
consul
which
was
quite
funny

the

while
major

was
marshalling
the
usual
stream
of
visitors
from
england
germany
the
pacific
slope
of
warm
admirers
from
remote

a

about
six

four
of
middle
age
but
with
every
one
of
his
great
sinews
and
muscles
as
fit
as
ever
came
in
and
asked
to
see
me
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
former
friend
as
the
line
passed
he
was
introduced
to
me
as
white
i
greeted
him
in
the
usual
rather
perfunctory
manner
and
the
huge
fellow
shyly
remarked
roosevelt
maybe
you
do
recollect
me
i
worked
on
the
roundup
with
you
twenty
years
ago
next
spring
my
outfit
joined
yours
at
the
mouth
of
the
box
alder
i
gazed
at
him
and
at
once
said
why
it
is
big
jim
he
was
a
great
and
is
still
riding
the
range
in
northwestern
nebraska
when
i
knew
him
he
was
a
tremendous
fighting
man
but
always
liked
me
twice
i
had
to
interfere
to
prevent
him
from
half
murdering
cowboys
from
my
own
ranch
i
had
him
at
lunch
with
a
mixed
company
of
home
and
foreign
notabilities
do
worry
about
the
lessons

know
you
are
studying
hard
do
get
cast
down
sometimes
in
life
both
at
school
and
afterwards
fortune
will
go
against
any
one
but
if
he
just
keeps
pegging
away
and
does
lose
his
courage
things
always
take
a
turn
for
the
better
in

white

blessed

for
a
week
the
weather
has
been
cold
down
to
zero
at
night
and
rarely
above
freezing
in
the
shade
at
noon
in
consequence
the
snow
has
lain
well
and
as
there
has
been
a
waxing
moon
i
have
had
the
most
delightful
evening
and
night
rides
imaginable
i
have
been
so
busy
that
i
have
been
unable
to
get
away
until
after
dark
but
i
went
in
the
fur
jacket
uncle
will
presented
to
me
as
the
fruit
of
his
prize
money
in
the
spanish
war
and
the
moonlight
on
the
glittering
snow
made
the
rides
lovelier
than
they
would
have
been
in
the
daytime
sometimes
mother
and
ted
went
with
me
and
the
gallops
were
delightful
it
has
snowed
heavily
again
but
the
snow
has
been
so
soft
that
i
did
not
like
to
go
out
and
besides
i
have
been
worked
up
to
the
limit
there
has
been
skating
and
all
the
week
the
new

becoming
very
much
at
home
and
very
fond
of
the
family
with
archie
and
quentin
i
have
finished
the
last
of
the
mohicans
and
have
now
begun
the
deerslayer
they
are
as
cunning
as
ever
and
this
reading
to
them
in
the
evening
gives
me
a
chance
to
see
them
that
i
would
not
otherwise
have
although
sometimes
it
is
rather
hard
to
get
time
mother
looks
very
young
and
pretty
this
afternoon
she
was
most
busy
taking
the
little
boys
to
the
theatre
and
then
going
to
hear
ethel
sing
ted
very
swell
in
his
first
tail
coat
is
going
out
to
take
supper
at
secretary
morton
whose
pretty
daughter
is
coming
out
in
a
very
few
days
now
we
shall
see
you
again
playmate
of
the
children
to
and
emlen
roosevelt
white
house
i
am
really
touched
at
the
way
in
which
your
children
as
well
as
my
own
treat
me
as
a
friend
and
playmate
it
has
its
comic
side
thus
the
last
day
the
boys
were
here
they
were
all
bent
upon
having
me
take
them
for
a
scramble
down
rock
creek
of
course
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
why
they
could
not
go
alone
but
they
obviously
felt
that
my
presence
was
needed
to
give
zest
to
the
entertainment
accordingly
off
i
went
with
the
two
russell
boys
george
jack
and
philip
and
ted
kermit
and
archie
with
one
of
archie
friends
a
sturdy
little
boy
who
as
archie
informed
me
had
played
opposite
to
him
in
the
position
of
centre
rush
last
fall
i
do
not
think
that
one
of
them
saw
anything
incongruous
in
the
president
getting
as
bedaubed
with
mud
as
they
got
or
in
my
wiggling
and
clambering
around
jutting
rocks
through
cracks
and
up
what
were
really
small
cliff
faces
just
like
the
rest
of
them
and
whenever
any
one
of
them
beat
me
at
any
point
he
felt
and
expressed
simple
and
delight
exactly
as
if
it
had
been
a
triumph
over
a
rival
of
his
own
age
a
japanese
boy
letter
to
william
sturgis
bigelow
white
house
dear
sturgis
last
year
when
i
had
professor
yamashita
teach
me
the
jiudo
as
they
seem
now
to
call
jiu
jitsu
the
naval
attache
here
commander
takashita
used
to
come
around
here
and
bring
a
young
lad
kitgaki
who
is
now
entering
annapolis
i
used
to
wrestle
with
them
both
they
were
very
fond
of
archie
and
were
very
good
to
him
this
christmas
kitgaki
sent
from
annapolis
a
little
present
to
archie
who
wrote
to
thank
him
and
kitgaki
sent
him
a
letter
back
that
we
like
so
much
that
i
thought
you
might
enjoy
it
as
it
shows
so
nice
a
trait
in
the
japanese
character
it
runs
as
follows
my
dearest
boy
i
received
your
nice
letter
i
thank
you
ever
so
much
i
am
very
very
glad
that
you
have
receive
my
small
present
i
like
you
very
very
much
when
i
have
been
in
jiudo
room
with
your
father
and
you
your
father
was
talking
to
us
about
the
picture
of
the
cavalry
officer
in
that
time
i
saw
some
expression
on
your
face
another
remembering
of
you
is
your
bravery
when
you
sleped
down
from
a
tall
chair
the
two
rememberings
ca
leave
from
my
head
i
returned
here
last
thursday
and
have
plenty
lesson
so
my
work
is
hard
hard
hard
more
than
jiudo
i
hope
your
good
health
i
am
sincerely
yours
a
kitgaki
is
it
a
nice
letter
on
counting
days
and
wrestling
white
house
darling
kermit
i
puzzled
a
good
deal
over
your
marks
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
one
explanation
is
that
you
have
thought
so
much
of
home
as
to
prevent
your
really
putting
your
whole
strength
into
your
studies
it
is
most
natural
that
you
should
count
the
days
before
coming
home
and
write
as
you
do
that
it
will
only
be
days
only
days
only
days
but
at
the
same
time
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
this
means
that
you
do
not
really
put
all
your
heart
and
all
your
head
effort
into
your
work
and
that
if
you
are
able
to
it
would
be
far
better
to
think
just
as
little
as
possible
about
coming
home
and
resolutely
set
yourself
to
putting
your
best
thought
into
your
work
it
is
an
illustration
of
the
old
adage
about
putting
your
hand
to
the
plow
and
then
looking
back
in
after
life
of
course
it
is
always
possible
that
at
some
time
you
may
have
to
go
away
for
a
year
or
two
from
home
to
do
some
piece
of
work
if
during
that
whole
time
you
only
thought
day
after
day
of
how
soon
you
would
get
home
i
think
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
do
your
best
work
and
maybe
this
feeling
may
be
partly
responsible
for
the
trouble
with
the
lessons
at
school
wednesday
washington
birthday
i
went
to
philadelphia
and
made
a
speech
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
took
lunch
with
the
philadelphia
city
troop
and
came
home
the
same
afternoon
with
less
fatigue
than
most
of
my
trips
cost
me
for
i
was
able
to
dodge
the
awful
evening
banquet
and
the
night
on
the
train
which
taken
together
drive
me
nearly
melancholy
mad
since
sunday
we
have
not
been
able
to
ride
i
still
box
with
grant
who
has
now
become
the
champion
middleweight
wrestler
of
the
united
states
yesterday
afternoon
we
had
professor
yamashita
up
here
to
wrestle
with
grant
it
was
very
interesting
but
of
course
jiu
jitsu
and
our
wrestling
are
so
far
apart
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
any
comparison
between
them
wrestling
is
simply
a
sport
with
rules
almost
as
conventional
as
those
of
tennis
while
jiu
jitsu
is
really
meant
for
practice
in
killing
or
disabling
our
adversary
in
consequence
grant
did
not
know
what
to
do
except
to
put
yamashita
on
his
back
and
yamashita
was
perfectly
content
to
be
on
his
back
inside
of
a
minute
yamashita
had
choked
grant
and
inside
of
two
minutes
more
he
got
an
elbow
hold
on
him
that
would
have
enabled
him
to
break
his
arm
so
that
there
is
no
question
but
that
he
could
have
put
grant
out
so
far
this
made
it
evident
that
the
jiu
jitsu
man
could
handle
the
ordinary
wrestler
but
grant
in
the
actual
wrestling
and
throwing
was
about
as
good
as
the
japanese
and
he
was
so
much
stronger
that
he
evidently
hurt
and
wore
out
the
japanese
with
a
little
practice
in
the
art
i
am
sure
that
one
of
our
big
wrestlers
or
boxers
simply
because
of
his
greatly
superior
strength
would
be
able
to
kill
any
of
those
japanese
who
though
very
good
men
for
their
inches
and
pounds
are
altogether
too
small
to
hold
their
own
against
big
powerful
quick
men
who
are
as
well
trained
spring
in
washington
white
house
march
dear
kermit
poor
john
hay
has
been
pretty
sick
he
is
going
away
to
try
to
pick
up
his
health
by
a
sea
voyage
and
rest
i
earnestly
hope
he
succeeds
not
only
because
of
my
great
personal
fondness
for
him
but
because
from
the
standpoint
of
the
nation
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
replace
him
every
sunday
on
my
way
home
from
church
i
have
been
accustomed
to
stop
in
and
see
him
the
conversation
with
him
was
always
delightful
and
during
these
sunday
morning
talks
we
often
decided
important
questions
of
public
policy
i
paid
a
scuttling
visit
to
new
york
on
friday
to
give
away
eleanor
at
her
marriage
and
to
make
two
speeches
one
to
the
friendly
sons
of
patrick
and
one
to
the
sons
of
the
american
revolution
mother
and
i
have
been
riding
a
good
deal
and
the
country
is
now
lovely
moreover
ted
and
matt
and
i
have
begun
playing
tennis
the
birds
have
come
back
not
only
and
robins
but
a
winter
wren
purple
finches
and
tufted
titmice
are
singing
in
the
garden
and
the
other
morning
early
mother
and
i
were
waked
up
by
the
loud
singing
of
a
cardinal
bird
in
the
magnolia
tree
just
outside
our
windows
yesterday
afternoon
archie
and
quentin
each
had
a
little
boy
to
see
him
they
climbed
trees
sailed
boats
in
the
fountain
and
dug
in
the
like
woodcocks
poor
frank
travers
died
last
night
i
was
very
sorry
he
has
been
a
good
friend
to
me
a
hunting
trip
colorado
springs
colorado
april
blessed
kermit
i
hope
you
had
as
successful
a
trip
in
florida
as
i
have
had
in
texas
and
oklahoma
the
first
six
days
were
of
the
usual
presidential
tour
type
but
much
more
pleasant
than
ordinarily
because
i
did
not
have
to
do
quite
as
much
speaking
and
there
was
a
certain
irresponsibility
about
it
all
due
i
suppose
in
part
to
the
fact
that
i
am
no
longer
a
candidate
and
am
free
from
the
everlasting
suspicion
and
judgment
which
being
a
candidate
entails
however
both
in
kentucky
and
especially
in
texas
i
was
received
with
a
warmth
and
heartiness
that
surprised
me
while
the
rough
riders
reunion
at
san
antonio
was
delightful
in
every
way
then
came
the
five
days
wolf
hunting
in
oklahoma
and
this
was
unalloyed
pleasure
except
for
my
uneasiness
about
auntie
bye
and
poor
little
sheffield
general
young
lambert
and
roly
fortescue
were
each
in
his
own
way
just
the
nicest
companions
imaginable
my
texas
hosts
were
too
kind
and
friendly
and
for
anything
i
want
to
have
the
whole
party
up
at
washington
next
winter
the
party
got
seventeen
wolves
three
coons
and
any
number
of
rattlesnakes
i
was
in
at
the
death
of
eleven
wolves
the
other
six
wolves
were
killed
by
members
of
the
party
who
were
off
with
bunches
of
dogs
in
some
place
where
i
was
not
i
never
took
part
in
a
run
which
ended
in
the
death
of
a
wolf
without
getting
through
the
run
in
time
to
see
the
death
it
was
tremendous
galloping
over
cut
banks
prairie
dog
towns
flats
creek
bottoms
everything
one
run
was
nine
miles
long
and
i
was
the
only
man
in
at
the
finish
except
the
professional
wolf
hunter
abernethy
who
is
a
really
wonderful
fellow
catching
the
wolves
alive
by
thrusting
his
gloved
hands
down
between
their
jaws
so
that
they
can
not
bite
he
caught
one
wolf
alive
tied
up
this
wolf
and
then
held
it
on
the
saddle
followed
his
dogs
in
a
run
and
helped
kill
another
wolf
he
has
a
pretty
wife
and
five
cunning
children
of
whom
he
is
very
proud
and
introduced
them
to
me
and
i
liked
him
much
we
were
in
the
saddle
eight
or
nine
hours
every
day
and
i
am
rather
glad
to
have
hours
rest
on
the
cars
before
starting
on
my
colorado
bear
hunt
abernethy
the
wolf
hunter
colorado
springs
colorado
april
dear
ted
i
do
wish
you
could
have
been
along
on
this
trip
it
has
been
great
fun
in
oklahoma
our
party
got
all
told
seventeen
coyotes
with
the
greyhounds
i
was
in
at
the
death
of
eleven
the
only
ones
started
by
the
dogs
with
which
i
happened
to
be
in
one
run
the
three
easterners
covered
themselves
with
glory
as
lambert
roly
fortescue
and
i
were
the
only
ones
who
got
through
excepting
abernethy
the
wolf
hunter
it
happened
because
it
was
a
run
and
all
the
cowboys
rode
their
horses
to
a
standstill
in
the
first
three
or
four
miles
after
which
i
came
bounding
along
like
kermit
in
the
paper
chase
and
got
to
the
end
in
time
to
see
the
really
remarkable
feat
of
abernethy
jumping
on
to
the
wolf
thrusting
his
gloved
hand
into
its
mouth
and
mastering
it
then
and
there
he
never
used
a
knife
or
a
rope
in
taking
these
wolves
seizing
them
by
sheer
quickness
and
address
and
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
wolf
mouth
in
such
a
way
that
it
lost
all
power
to
bite
you
would
have
loved
tom
burnett
the
son
of
the
big
cattle
man
he
is
a
splendid
fellow
about
thirty
years
old
and
just
the
ideal
of
what
a
young
cattle
man
should
be
up
here
we
have
opened
well
we
have
two
cracker
jacks
as
guides
john
goff
my
old
guide
on
the
mountain
lion
hunt
and
jake
borah
who
has
somewhat
the
seth
bullock
type
of
face
we
have
about
thirty
dogs
including
one
absurd
little
terrier
about
half
jack
size
named
skip
skip
trots
all
day
long
with
the
hounds
excepting
when
he
can
persuade
stewart
or
lambert
or
me
to
take
him
up
for
a
ride
for
which
he
is
always
begging
he
is
most
affectionate
and
intelligent
but
when
there
is
a
bear
or
lynx
at
bay
he
joins
in
the
fight
with
all
the
fury
of
a
bull
dog
though
i
do
not
think
he
is
much
more
effective
than
one
of
your
japanese
mice
would
be
i
should
like
to
bring
him
home
for
archie
or
quentin
he
would
go
everywhere
with
them
and
would
ride
betsy
or
algonquin
on
the
third
day
out
i
got
a
fine
big
black
bear
an
old
male
who
would
not
tree
but
made
what
they
call
in
mississippi
a
walking
bay
with
the
dogs
fighting
them
off
all
the
time
the
chase
lasted
nearly
two
hours
and
was
ended
by
a
hard
scramble
up
a
canyon
side
and
i
made
a
pretty
good
shot
at
him
as
he
was
walking
off
with
the
pack
around
him
he
killed
one
dog
and
crippled
three
that
i
think
will
recover
besides
scratching
others
my
springfield
worked
to
perfection
on
the
bear
i
suppose
you
are
now
in
the
thick
of
your
studies
and
will
have
but
little
time
to
rest
after
the
examinations
i
shall
be
back
about
the
and
then
we
can
take
up
our
tennis
again
give
my
regards
to
matt
i
am
particularly
pleased
that
maurice
turned
out
so
well
he
has
always
been
so
pleasant
to
me
that
i
had
hoped
he
would
turn
out
all
right
in
the
end
prairie
girls
divide
creek
april
darling
ethel
of
course
you
remember
the
story
of
the
little
prairie
girl
i
always
associate
it
with
you
well
again
and
again
on
this
trip
we
would
pass
through
prairie
villages
bleak
and
lonely
with
all
the
people
in
from
miles
about
to
see
me
among
them
were
often
dozens
of
young
girls
often
pretty
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
much
more
happy
than
the
heroine
of
the
story
one
of
them
shook
hands
with
me
and
then
after
much
whispering
said
we
want
to
shake
hands
with
the
guard
the
guard
proved
to
be
roly
who
was
very
swell
in
his
uniform
and
whom
they
evidently
thought
much
more
attractive
than
the
president
both
in
age
and
looks
there
are
plenty
of
ranchmen
round
here
they
drive
over
to
camp
to
see
me
usually
bringing
a
cake
or
some
milk
and
eggs
and
are
very
nice
and
friendly
about
twenty
of
the
men
came
out
with
me
to
see
the
president
shoot
a
bear
and
fortunately
i
did
so
in
the
course
of
an
exhausting
twelve
hours
ride
i
am
very
homesick
for
you
all
bears
bobcats
and
skip

blessed
kermit
i
was
delighted
to
get
your
letter
i
am
sorry
you
are
having
such
a
hard
time
in
mathematics
but
hope
a
couple
of
weeks
will
set
you
all
right
we
have
had
a
very
successful
hunt
all
told
we
have
obtained
ten
bear
and
three
bobcats
lambert
has
been
a
perfect
trump
he
is
in
the
pink
of
condition
while
for
the
last
week
i
have
been
a
little
knocked
out
by
the
cuban
fever
up
to
that
time
i
was
simply
in
splendid
shape
there
is
a
very
cunning
little
dog
named
skip
belonging
to
john
goff
pack
who
has
completely
adopted
me
i
think
i
shall
take
him
home
to
archie
he
likes
to
ride
on
lambert
horse
or
mine
and
though
he
is
not
as
big
as
jack
takes
eager
part
in
the
fight
with
every
bear
and
bobcat
i
am
sure
you
will
enjoy
your
trip
to
deadwood
with
seth
bullock
and
as
soon
as
you
return
from
groton
i
shall
write
to
him
about
it
i
have
now
become
very
homesick
for
mother
and
shall
be
glad
when
the
of
may
comes
and
i
am
back
in
the
white
house
home
again
with
skip
white
house
may
dear
kermit
here
i
am
back
again
and
mighty
glad
to
be
back
it
was
perfectly
delightful
to
see
mother
and
the
children
but
it
made
me
very
homesick
for
you
of
course
i
was
up
to
my
ears
in
work
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
white
house
but
in
two
or
three
days
we
shall
be
through
it
and
can
settle
down
into
our
old
routine
yesterday
afternoon
we
played
tennis
herbert
knox
smith
and
i
beating
matt
and
murray
i
shall
take
cunning
mother
out
for
a
ride
skip
accompanied
me
to
washington
he
is
not
as
yet
entirely
at
home
in
the
white
house
and
rather
clings
to
my
companionship
i
think
he
will
soon
be
fond
of
archie
who
loves
him
dearly
mother
is
kind
to
skip
but
she
does
not
think
he
is
an
aristocrat
as
jack
is
he
is
a
very
cunning
little
dog
all
the
same
mother
walked
with
me
to
church
this
morning
and
both
the
past
evenings
we
have
been
able
to
go
out
into
the
garden
and
sit
on
the
stone
benches
near
the
fountain
the
country
is
too
lovely
for
anything
everything
being
a
deep
rich
fresh
green
i
had
a
great
time
in
chicago
with
the
labor
union
men
they
made
what
i
regarded
as
a
rather
insolent
demand
upon
me
and
i
gave
them
some
perfectly
straight
talk
about
their
duty
and
about
the
preservation
of
law
and
order
the
trouble
seems
to
be
increasing
there
and
i
may
have
to
send
federal
troops
into
the
city
though
i
shall
not
do
so
unless
it
is
necessary
skip
in
the
white
house
white
house
may
dear
kermit
that
was
a
good
mark
in
latin
and
i
am
pleased
with
your
steady
improvement
in
it
skip
is
housebroken
but
he
is
like
a
real
little
indian
he
can
stand
any
amount
of
hard
work
if
there
is
a
bear
or
bobcat
ahead
but
now
that
he
is
in
the
white
house
he
thinks
he
would
much
rather
do
nothing
but
sit
about
all
day
with
his
friends
and
threatens
to
turn
into
a
lapdog
but
when
we
get
him
to
oyster
bay
i
think
we
can
make
him
go
out
riding
with
us
and
then
i
think
he
will
be
with
archie
a
great
deal
he
and
jack
are
rather
jealous
of
one
another
he
is
very
cunning
and
friendly
i
am
immensely
pleased
with
mother
virginia
cottage
and
its
name
i
am
going
down
there
for
sunday
with
her
some
time
soon
your
marks
have
just
come
by
george
you
have
worked
hard
and
i
am
delighted
three
cheers
officers
of
togo
fleet
white
house
june
dear
kermit
next
friday
i
am
going
down
with
mother
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
at
pine
knot
which
mother
loves
just
as
ethel
loves
fidelity
she
and
i
have
had
some
lovely
rides
together
and
if
i
do
not
go
riding
with
her
i
play
tennis
with
ted
and
some
of
his
and
my
friends
yesterday
ted
and
one
of
his
friends
played
seven
sets
of
tennis
against
cooley
and
me
and
beat
us
four
to
three
in
the
evening
commander
takashita
brought
in
half
a
dozen
japanese
naval
officers
who
had
been
with
togo
fleet
off
port
arthur
and
had
taken
part
in
the
fleet
actions
the
attacks
with
the
flotilla
and
so
forth
i
tell
you
they
were
a
set
and
evidently
dead
game
fighters
a
president
as
cook
white
house
june
dear
kermit
mother
and
i
have
just
come
home
from
a
lovely
trip
to
pine
knot
it
is
really
a
perfectly
delightful
little
place
the
nicest
little
place
of
the
kind
you
can
imagine
mother
is
a
great
deal
more
pleased
with
it
than
any
child
with
any
toy
i
ever
saw
she
went
down
the
day
before
thursday
and
i
followed
on
friday
morning
good
joe
wilmer
met
me
at
the
station
and
we
rode
on
horseback
to
round
top
where
we
met
mother
and
willie
wilmer
we
all
had
tea
there
and
then
drove
to
plain
dealing
where
we
had
dinner
of
course
i
loved
both
round
top
and
plain
dealing
and
as
for
the
two
wilmers
they
are
the
most
generous
thoughtful
friends
that
any
one
could
wish
to
see
after
dinner
we
went
over
to
pine
knot
put
everything
to
order
and
went
to
bed
next
day
we
spent
all
by
ourselves
at
pine
knot
in
the
morning
i
fried
bacon
and
eggs
while
mother
boiled
the
kettle
for
tea
and
laid
the
table
breakfast
was
most
successful
and
then
mother
washed
the
dishes
and
did
most
of
the
work
while
i
did
odd
jobs
then
we
walked
about
the
place
which
is
fifteen
acres
in
all
saw
the
lovely
spring
admired
the
pine
trees
and
the
oak
trees
and
then
mother
lay
in
the
hammock
while
i
cut
away
some
trees
to
give
us
a
better
view
from
the
piazza
the
piazza
is
the
real
feature
of
the
house
it
is
broad
and
runs
along
the
whole
length
and
the
roof
is
high
near
the
wall
for
it
is
a
continuation
of
the
roof
of
the
house
it
was
lovely
to
sit
there
in
the
and
hear
all
the
birds
by
daytime
and
at
night
the
whippoorwills
and
owls
and
little
forest
folk
inside
the
house
is
just
a
bare
wall
with
one
big
room
below
which
is
nice
now
and
will
be
still
nicer
when
the
chimneys
are
up
and
there
is
a
fireplace
in
each
end
a
rough
flight
of
stairs
leads
above
where
there
are
two
rooms
separated
by
a
passageway
we
did
everything
for
ourselves
but
all
the
food
we
had
was
sent
over
to
us
by
the
dear
wilmers
together
with
milk
we
cooked
it
ourselves
so
there
was
no
one
around
the
house
to
bother
us
at
all
as
we
found
that
cleaning
dishes
took
up
an
awful
time
we
only
took
two
meals
a
day
which
was
all
we
wanted
on
saturday
evening
i
fried
two
chickens
for
dinner
while
mother
boiled
the
tea
and
we
had
cherries
and
wild
strawberries
as
well
as
biscuits
and
cornbread
to
my
pleasure
mother
greatly
enjoyed
the
fried
chicken
and
admitted
that
what
you
children
had
said
of
the
way
i
fried
chicken
was
all
true
in
the
evening
we
sat
out
a
long
time
on
the
piazza
and
then
read
indoors
and
then
went
to
bed
sunday
morning
we
did
not
get
up
until
nine
then
i
fried
mother
some
beefsteak
and
some
eggs
in
two
and
she
liked
them
both
very
much
we
went
to
church
at
the
dear
little
church
where
the
wilmers
father
and
mother
had
been
married
dined
soon
after
two
at
plain
dealing
and
then
were
driven
over
to
the
station
to
go
back
to
washington
i
rode
the
big
black
stallion
chief
and
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
altogether
we
had
a
very
nice
holiday
i
was
lucky
to
be
able
to
get
it
for
during
the
past
fortnight
and
indeed
for
a
considerable
time
before
i
have
been
carrying
on
negotiations
with
both
russia
and
japan
together
with
side
negotiations
with
germany
france
and
england
to
try
to
get
the
present
war
stopped
with
infinite
labor
and
by
the
exercise
of
a
good
deal
of
tact
and
judgment
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
have
finally
gotten
the
japanese
and
russians
to
agree
to
meet
to
discuss
the
terms
of
peace
whether
they
will
be
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
or
not
i
ca
say
but
it
is
worth
while
to
have
obtained
the
chance
of
peace
and
the
only
possible
way
to
get
this
chance
was
to
secure
such
an
agreement
of
the
two
powers
that
they
would
meet
and
discuss
the
terms
direct
of
course
japan
will
want
to
ask
more
than
she
ought
to
ask
and
russia
to
give
less
than
she
ought
to
give
perhaps
both
sides
will
prove
impracticable
perhaps
one
will
but
there
is
the
chance
that
they
will
prove
sensible
and
make
a
peace
which
will
really
be
for
the
interest
of
each
as
things
are
now
at
any
rate
the
experiment
was
worth
trying
i
have
kept
the
secret
very
successfully
and
my
dealings
with
the
japanese
in
particular
have
been
known
to
no
one
so
that
the
result
is
in
the
nature
of
a
surprise
quentin
quaint
sayings
oyster
bay
dear
kermit
phil
stewart
and
lambert
spent
a
night
here
quentin
greeting
the
former
with
most
cordial
friendship
and
in
explanation
stating
that
he
always
liked
to
get
acquainted
with
everybody
i
take
hall
to
chop
and
he
plays
tennis
with
phil
and
oliver
and
rides
with
phil
and
quentin
the
plunger
a
submarine
has
come
to
the
bay
and
i
am
going
out
in
it
this
afternoon
or
rather
down
on
it
n
i
have
just
been
down
for
minutes
it
was
very
interesting
last
night
i
listened
to
mother
reading
the
lances
of
linwood
to
the
two
little
boys
and
then
hearing
them
their
prayers
then
i
went
into
archie
room
where
they
both
showed
all
their
china
animals
i
read
them
laura
richards
poems
including
how
does
the
president
take
his
tea
they
christened
themselves
punkey
doodle
and
jollapin
from
the
chorus
of
this
and
immediately
afterwards
i
played
with
them
on
archie
bed
first
i
would
toss
punkey
doodle
quentin
on
jollapin
archie
and
tickle
jollapin
while
punkey
doodle
squalled
and
wiggled
on
top
of
him
and
then
reverse
them
and
keep
punkey
doodle
down
by
heaving
jollapin
on
him
while
they
both
kicked
and
struggled
until
my
shirt
front
looked
very
much
the
worse
for
wear
you
doubtless
remember
yourself
how
bad
it
was
for
me
when
i
was
dressed
for
dinner
to
play
with
all
you
scamps
when
you
were
little
the
other
day
a
reporter
asked
quentin
something
about
me
to
which
that
affable
and
canny
young
gentleman
responded
yes
i
see
him
sometimes
but
i
know
nothing
of
his
family
life
advice
regarding
newspaper
annoyances
when
theodore
roosevelt
entered
harvard
as
a
freshman
he
had
to
pay
the
penalty
of
being
a
president
son
newspaper
reporters
followed
all
his
movements
especially
in
athletics
and
he
was
the
victim
of
many
exaggerated
and
often
purely
fictitious
accounts
of
his
doings
his
father
wrote
him
indignant
and
sympathetic
letters
two
of
which
are
reproduced
here
white
house
october
blessed
old
ted
the
thing
to
do
is
to
go
on
just
as
you
have
evidently
been
doing
attract
as
little
attention
as
possible
do
not
make
a
fuss
about
the
newspaper
men
camera
creatures
and
idiots
generally
letting
it
be
seen
that
you
do
not
like
them
and
avoid
them
but
not
letting
them
betray
you
into
any
excessive
irritation
i
believe
they
will
soon
drop
you
and
it
is
just
an
unpleasant
thing
that
you
will
have
to
live
down
ted
i
have
had
an
enormous
number
of
unpleasant
things
that
i
have
had
to
live
down
in
my
life
at
different
times
and
you
have
begun
to
have
them
now
i
saw
that
you
were
not
out
on
the
football
field
on
saturday
and
was
rather
glad
of
it
as
evidently
those
infernal
idiots
were
eagerly
waiting
for
you
but
whenever
you
do
go
you
will
have
to
make
up
your
mind
that
they
will
make
it
exceedingly
unpleasant
for
you
for
once
or
twice
and
you
will
just
have
to
bear
it
for
you
can
never
in
the
world
afford
to
let
them
drive
you
away
from
anything
you
intend
to
do
whether
it
is
football
or
anything
else
and
by
going
about
your
own
business
quietly
and
pleasantly
doing
just
what
you
would
do
if
they
were
not
there
generally
they
will
get
tired
of
it
and
the
boys
themselves
will
see
that
it
is
not
your
fault
and
will
feel
if
anything
rather
a
sympathy
for
you
meanwhile
i
want
you
to
know
that
we
are
all
thinking
of
you
and
sympathizing
with
you
the
whole
time
and
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
me
to
have
such
confidence
in
you
and
to
know
that
though
these
creatures
can
cause
you
a
little
trouble
and
make
you
feel
a
little
downcast
they
can
not
drive
you
one
way
or
the
other
or
make
you
alter
the
course
you
have
set
out
for
yourself
we
were
all
of
us
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
rather
blue
at
getting
back
in
the
white
house
simply
because
we
missed
sagamore
hill
so
much
but
it
is
very
beautiful
and
we
feel
very
ungrateful
at
having
even
a
passing
fit
of
blueness
and
we
are
enjoying
it
to
the
full
now
i
have
just
seen
archie
dragging
some
fifty
foot
of
hose
pipe
across
the
tennis
court
to
play
in
the
i
have
been
playing
tennis
with
pinchot
who
beat
me
three
sets
to
one
the
only
being
the
one
i
won
this
is
just
an
occasion
to
show
the
stuff
there
is
in
you
do
not
let
these
newspaper
creatures
and
kindred
idiots
drive
you
one
breadth
from
the
line
you
had
marked
out
in
football
or
anything
else
avoid
any
fuss
if
possible
white
house
october
dear
ted
i
was
delighted
to
find
from
your
last
letters
that
you
are
evidently
having
a
pretty
good
time
in
spite
of
the
newspaper
and
kodak
creatures
i
guess
that
nuisance
is
now
pretty
well
abated
every
now
and
then
they
will
do
something
horrid
but
i
think
you
can
safely
from
now
on
ignore
them
entirely
i
shall
be
interested
to
hear
how
you
get
on
first
of
all
with
your
studies
in
which
you
seem
to
have
started
well
and
next
with
football
i
expected
that
you
would
find
it
hard
to
compete
with
the
other
candidates
for
the
position
of
end
as
they
are
mostly
heavier
than
you
especially
since
you
went
off
in
weight
owing
to
the
excitement
of
your
last
weeks
of
holiday
in
the
summer
of
course
the
fact
that
you
are
comparatively
light
tells
against
you
and
gives
you
a
good
deal
to
overcome
and
undoubtedly
it
was
from
this
standpoint
not
a
good
thing
that
you
were
unable
to
lead
a
quieter
life
toward
the
end
of
your
stay
at
oyster
bay
so
it
is
about
the
polo
club
in
my
day
we
looked
with
suspicion
upon
all
freshman
societies
and
the
men
who
tried
to
get
them
up
or
were
prominent
in
them
rarely
amounted
to
much
in
the
class
afterwards
and
it
has
happened
that
i
have
heard
rather
unfavorably
of
the
polo
club
but
it
may
be
mere
accident
that
i
have
thus
heard
unfavorably
about
it
and
in
thirty
years
the
attitude
of
the
best
fellows
in
college
to
such
a
thing
as
a
freshman
club
may
have
changed
so
absolutely
that
my
experience
can
be
of
no
value
exercise
your
own
best
judgment
and
form
some
idea
of
what
the
really
best
fellows
in
the
class
think
on
the
subject
do
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
men
who
are
merely
undeveloped
are
really
the
best
fellows
no
matter
how
pleasant
and
agreeable
they
are
or
how
popular
popularity
is
a
good
thing
but
it
is
not
something
for
which
to
sacrifice
studies
or
athletics
or
good
standing
in
any
way
and
sometimes
to
seek
it
overmuch
is
to
lose
it
i
do
not
mean
this
as
applying
to
you
but
as
applying
to
certain
men
who
still
have
a
great
vogue
at
first
in
the
class
and
of
whom
you
will
naturally
tend
to
think
pretty
well
in
all
these
things
i
can
only
advise
you
in
a
very
general
way
you
are
on
the
ground
you
know
the
men
and
the
general
college
sentiment
you
have
gone
in
with
the
serious
purpose
of
doing
decently
and
honorably
of
standing
well
in
your
studies
of
showing
that
in
athletics
you
mean
business
up
to
the
extent
of
your
capacity
and
of
getting
the
respect
and
liking
of
your
classmates
so
far
as
they
can
be
legitimately
obtained
as
to
the
exact
methods
of
carrying
out
these
objects
i
must
trust
to
you
incidents
of
a
southern
trip
white
house
dear
kermit
i
had
a
great
time
in
the
south
and
it
was
very
nice
indeed
having
john
mcilhenny
and
john
greenway
with
me
of
course
i
enjoyed
most
the
three
days
when
mother
was
there
but
i
was
so
well
received
and
had
so
many
things
to
say
which
i
was
really
glad
to
say
that
the
whole
trip
was
a
success
when
i
left
new
orleans
on
the
little
lighthouse
tender
to
go
down
to
the
gulf
where
the
big
war
ship
was
awaiting
me
we
had
a
collision
i
was
standing
up
at
the
time
and
the
shock
pitched
me
forward
so
that
i
dove
right
through
the
window
taking
the
glass
all
out
except
a
jagged
rim
round
the
very
edge
but
i
went
through
so
quickly
that
i
received
only
some
minute
scratches
on
my
face
and
hands
which
however
bled
pretty
freely
i
was
very
glad
to
come
up
the
coast
on
the
squadron
of
great
armored
cruisers
in
the
gulf
the
weather
was
hot
and
calm
but
soon
after
rounding
florida
and
heading
northward
we
ran
into
a
gale
admiral
brownson
is
a
regular
little
gamecock
and
he
drove
the
vessels
to
their
limit
it
was
great
fun
to
see
the
huge
warcraft
pounding
steadily
into
the
gale
and
forging
onward
through
the
billows
some
of
the
waves
were
so
high
that
the
water
came
clean
over
the
flying
bridge
forward
and
some
of
the
officers
were
thrown
down
and
badly
bruised
one
of
the
other
ships
lost
a
man
overboard
and
although
we
hunted
for
him
an
hour
and
a
half
we
could
not
get
him
and
had
a
boat
smashed
in
the
endeavor
when
i
got
back
here
i
found
sister
very
interesting
about
her
eastern
trip
she
has
had
a
great
time
and
what
is
more
she
has
behaved
mighty
well
under
rather
trying
circumstances
ethel
was
a
dear
as
always
and
the
two
little
boys
were
as
cunning
as
possible
sister
had
brought
them
some
very
small
japanese
fencing
armor
which
they
had
of
course
put
on
with
glee
and
were
clumsily
fencing
with
wooden
swords
and
they
had
also
rigged
up
in
the
dark
nursery
a
gruesome
man
with
a
pumpkin
head
which
i
was
ushered
in
to
see
and
in
addition
to
the
regular
eyes
nose
and
mouth
archie
had
carved
in
the
back
of
the
pumpkin
the
words
pumpkin
giant
the
candle
inside
illuminating
it
beautifully
mother
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
navy
yard
looking
too
pretty
for
anything
when
i
arrived
she
and
i
had
a
ride
this
afternoon
of
course
i
am
up
to
my
ears
in
work
the
mornings
are
lovely
now
crisp
and
fresh
after
breakfast
mother
and
i
walk
around
the
grounds
accompanied
by
skip
and
also
by
slipper
her
bell
tinkling
loudly
the
gardens
are
pretty
dishevelled
now
but
the
flowers
that
are
left
are
still
lovely
even
yet
some
honeysuckle
is
blooming
on
the
porch
poets

white
house
november
dear
kermit
just
a
line
for
i
really
have
nothing
to
say
this
week
i
have
caught
up
with
my
work
one
day
we
had
a
rather
forlorn
little
poet
and
his
nice
wife
in
at
lunch
they
made
me
feel
quite
badly
by
being
so
grateful
at
my
having
mentioned
him
in
what
i
fear
was
a
very
patronizing
and
indeed
almost
supercilious
way
as
having
written
an
occasional
good
poem
i
am
much
struck
by
robinson
two
poems
which
you
sent
mother
what
a
queer
mystical
creature
he
is
i
did
not
understand
one
of
them
that
about
the
gardens
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
like
either
of
them
quite
as
much
as
some
of
those
in
the
children
of
the
night
but
he
certainly
has
got
the
real
spirit
of
poetry
in
him
whether
he
can
make
it
come
out
i
am
not
quite
sure
prince
louis
of
battenberg
has
been
here
and
i
have
been
very
much
pleased
with
him
he
is
a
really
good
admiral
and
in
addition
he
is
a
and
cultivated
man
and
it
was
charming
to
talk
with
him
we
had
him
and
his
nephew
prince
alexander
a
midshipman
to
lunch
alone
with
us
and
we
really
enjoyed
having
them
at
the
state
dinner
he
sat
between
me
and
bonaparte
and
i
could
not
help
smiling
to
myself
in
thinking
that
here
was
this
british
admiral
seated
beside
the
american
secretary
of
the
navy
the
american
secretary
of
the
navy
being
the
grandnephew
of
napoleon
and
the
grandson
of
jerome
king
of
westphalia
while
the
british
admiral
was
the
grandson
of
a
hessian
general
who
was
the
subject
of
king
jerome
and
served
under
napoleon
and
then
by
no
means
creditably
deserted
him
in
the
middle
of
the
battle
of
leipsic
i
am
off
to
vote
novels
and
games
white
house
november
dear
kermit
i
sympathize
with
every
word
you
say
in
your
letter
about
nicholas
nickleby
and
about
novels
generally
normally
i
only
care
for
a
novel
if
the
ending
is
good
and
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
if
the
hero
has
to
die
he
ought
to
die
worthily
and
nobly
so
that
our
sorrow
at
the
tragedy
shall
be
tempered
with
the
joy
and
pride
one
always
feels
when
a
man
does
his
duty
well
and
bravely
there
is
quite
enough
sorrow
and
shame
and
suffering
and
baseness
in
real
life
and
there
is
no
need
for
meeting
it
unnecessarily
in
fiction
as
police
commissioner
it
was
my
duty
to
deal
with
all
kinds
of
squalid
misery
and
hideous
and
unspeakable
infamy
and
i
should
have
been
worse
than
a
coward
if
i
had
shrunk
from
doing
what
was
necessary
but
there
would
have
been
no
use
whatever
in
my
reading
novels
detailing
all
this
misery
and
squalor
and
crime
or
at
least
in
reading
them
as
a
steady
thing
now
and
then
there
is
a
powerful
but
sad
story
which
really
is
interesting
and
which
really
does
good
but
normally
the
books
which
do
good
and
the
books
which
healthy
people
find
interesting
are
those
which
are
not
in
the
least
of
the
variety
but
which
while
portraying
foulness
and
suffering
when
they
must
be
portrayed
yet
have
a
joyous
as
well
as
a
noble
side
we
have
had
a
very
mild
and
open
fall
i
have
played
tennis
a
good
deal
the
french
ambassador
being
now
quite
a
steady
playmate
as
he
and
i
play
about
alike
and
i
have
ridden
with
mother
a
great
deal
last
monday
when
mother
had
gone
to
new
york
i
had
selous
the
great
african
hunter
to
spend
the
day
and
night
he
is
a
perfect
old
dear
just
as
simple
and
natural
as
can
be
and
very
interesting
i
took
him
with
bob
bacon
gifford
pinchot
ambassador
meyer
and
jim
garfield
for
a
good
scramble
and
climb
in
the
afternoon
and
they
all
came
to
dinner
afterwards
before
we
came
down
to
dinner
i
got
him
to
spend
of
an
hour
in
telling
delightfully
exciting
lion
and
hyena
stories
to
ethel
archie
and
quentin
he
told
them
most
vividly
and
so
enthralled
the
little
boys
that
the
next
evening
i
had
to
tell
them
a
large
number
myself
is
quentin
birthday
and
he
loved
his
gifts
perhaps
most
of
all
the
weest
cunningest
live
pig
you
ever
saw
presented
him
by
straus
phil
stewart
and
his
wife
and
boy
wolcott
who
is
archie
age
spent
a
couple
of
nights
here
one
afternoon
we
had
bringing
down
garfield
and
the
garfield
boys
and
archie
turning
up
with
the
entire
football
team
who
took
a
day
off
for
the
special
purpose
we
had
obstacle
races
buff
and
everything
else
and
there
were
times
when
i
felt
that
there
was
a
perfect
shoal
of
small
boys
bursting
in
every
direction
up
and
down
stairs
and
through
and
over
every
conceivable
object
mother
and
i
still
walk
around
the
grounds
every
day
after
breakfast
the
gardens
of
course
are
very
very
dishevelled
now
the
holding
out
better
than
any
other
flowers
christmas
present
to
his
old
nurse
to
dora
watkins
white
house
december
dear
dolly
i
wish
you
a
merry
christmas
and
want
you
to
buy
whatever
you
think
you
would
like
with
the
enclosed
check
for
twenty
dollars
it
is
now
just
forty
years
since
you
stopped
being
my
nurse
when
i
was
a
little
boy
of
seven
just
one
year
younger
than
quentin
now
is
i
wish
you
could
see
the
children
play
here
in
the
white
house
grounds
for
the
last
three
days
there
has
been
snow
and
archie
and
quentin
and
their
cousin
cunning
little
sheffield
cowles
and
their
other
cousin
john
elliott
little
girl
helena
who
is
a
perfect
little
dear
have
been
having
all
kinds
of
romps
in
the
snow
coasting
having
snowball
fights
and
doing
everything
in
the
grounds
back
of
the
white
house
this
coming
saturday
afternoon
i
have
agreed
to
have
a
great
play
of
in
the
white
house
itself
not
only
with
these
children
but
with
their
various
small
friends
dickens
and
thackeray
white
house
february
dear
kermit
i
agree
pretty
well
with
your
views
of
david
copperfield
dora
was
very
cunning
and
attractive
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
husband
would
retain
enough
respect
for
her
to
make
life
quite
what
it
ought
to
be
with
her
this
is
a
harsh
criticism
and
i
have
known
plenty
of
women
of
the
dora
type
whom
i
have
felt
were
a
good
deal
better
than
the
men
they
married
and
i
have
seen
them
sometimes
make
very
happy
homes
i
also
feel
as
you
do
that
if
a
man
had
to
struggle
on
and
make
his
way
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
to
have
some
one
like
sophie
do
you
recollect
that
dinner
at
which
david
copperfield
and
traddles
were
where
they
are
described
as
seated
at
the
dinner
one
in
the
glare
of
the
red
velvet
lady
and
the
other
in
the
gloom
of
hamlet
aunt
i
am
so
glad
you
like
thackeray
pendennis
and
the
newcomes
and
vanity
fair
i
can
read
over
and
over
again
ted
blew
in
i
think
he
has
been
studying
pretty
well
this
term
and
now
he
is
through
all
his
examinations
but
one
he
hopes
and
i
do
that
you
will
pay
what
attention
you
can
to
athletics
play
hockey
for
instance
and
try
to
get
into
shape
for
the
mile
run
i
know
it
is
too
short
a
distance
for
you
but
if
you
will
try
for
the
hare
and
hounds
running
and
the
mile
too
you
may
be
able
to
try
for
the
two
miles
when
you
go
to
harvard
the
weather
was
very
mild
early
in
the
week
it
has
turned
cold
now
but
mother
and
i
had
a
good
ride
yesterday
and
ted
and
i
a
good
ride
this
afternoon
ted
on
grey
dawn
we
have
been
having
a
perfect
whirl
of
dinner
engagements
but
thank
heavens
they
will
stop
shortly
after
sister
wedding
a
tribute
to
archie
white
house
march
dear
kermit
i
agree
pretty
much
to
all
your
views
both
about
thackeray
and
dickens
although
you
care
for
some
of
thackeray
of
which
i
am
not
personally
fond
mother
loves
it
all
mother
by
the
way
has
been
reading
the
legend
of
montrose
to
the
little
boys
and
they
are
absorbed
in
it
she
finds
it
hard
to
get
anything
that
will
appeal
to
both
archie
and
quentin
as
they
possess
such
different
natures
i
am
quite
proud
of
what
archie
did
the
day
before
yesterday
some
of
the
bigger
boys
were
throwing
a
baseball
around
outside
of
school
and
it
hit
one
of
them
square
in
the
eye
breaking
all
the
and
making
an
extremely
dangerous
hurt
the
other
boys
were
all
rattled
and
could
do
nothing
finally
sneaking
off
when
sidwell
appeared
archie
stood
by
and
himself
promptly
suggested
that
the
boy
should
go
to
wilmer
accordingly
he
scorched
down
to
wilmer
and
said
there
was
an
emergency
case
for
one
of
boys
who
was
hurt
in
the
eye
and
could
he
bring
him
wilmer
who
did
not
know
archie
was
there
sent
out
word
to
of
course
do
so
so
archie
scorched
back
on
his
wheel
got
the
boy
i
do
not
know
why
sidwell
did
not
take
him
himself
and
led
him
down
to
wilmer
who
attended
to
his
eye
and
had
to
send
him
at
once
to
a
hospital
archie
waiting
until
he
heard
the
result
and
then
coming
home
wilmer
told
me
about
it
and
said
if
archie
had
not
acted
with
such
promptness
the
boy
who
was
four
or
five
years
older
than
archie
by
the
way
would
have
lost
his
sight
what
a
heavenly
place
a
sandbox
is
for
two
little
boys
archie
and
quentin
play
industriously
in
it
during
most
of
their
spare
moments
when
out
in
the
grounds
i
often
look
out
of
the
office
windows
when
i
have
a
score
of
senators
and
congressmen
with
me
and
see
them
both
hard
at
work
arranging
caverns
or
mountains
with
runways
for
their
marbles
blessed
fellow
i
shall
think
of
you
very
often
during
the
coming
week
and
i
am
so
very
glad
that
mother
is
to
be
with
you
at
your
confirmation
pillow
fights
with
the
boys
white
house
march
darling
kermit
during
the
four
days
mother
was
away
i
made
a
point
of
seeing
the
children
each
evening
for
of
an
hour
or
so
archie
and
quentin
are
really
great
playmates
one
night
i
came
and
found
quentin
playing
the
pianola
as
hard
as
he
could
while
archie
would
suddenly
start
from
the
end
of
the
hall
where
the
pianola
was
and
accompanied
by
both
the
dogs
race
as
hard
as
he
could
the
whole
length
of
the
white
house
clean
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
and
then
tear
back
again
another
evening
as
i
came
i
found
archie
and
quentin
having
a
great
play
chuckling
with
laughter
archie
driving
quentin
by
his
suspenders
which
were
fixed
to
the
end
of
a
pair
of
woollen
reins
then
they
would
ambush
me
and
we
would
have
a
vigorous
and
after
five
or
ten
minutes
of
this
we
would
go
into
mother
room
and
i
would
read
them
the
book
mother
had
been
reading
them
the
legend
of
montrose
we
just
got
through
it
the
very
last
evening
both
skip
and
jack
have
welcomed
mother
back
with
frantic
joy
and
this
morning
came
in
and
lay
on
her
bed
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
breakfast
for
she
did
not
come
down
to
either
breakfast
or
lunch
as
she
is
going
to
spend
the
night
at
baltimore
with
the
bonapartes
i
was
so
interested
in
your
reading
phineas
finn
that
i
ordered
a
copy
myself
i
have
also
ordered
dequincey
works
as
i
find
we

poor
skip
is
a
very
very
lonely
little
dog
without
his
family
each
morning
he
comes
up
to
see
me
at
breakfast
time
and
during
most
of
breakfast
which
i
take
in
the
hall
just
outside
my
room
skip
stands
with
his
little
paws
on
my
lap
then
when
i
get
through
and
sit
down
in
the
to
read
for
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
skip
hops
into
my
lap
and
stays
there
just
bathing
himself
in
the
companionship
of
the
only
one
of
his
family
he
has
left
the
rest
of
the
day
he
spends
with
the
ushers
as
i
am
so
frightfully
busy
that
i
am
nowhere
long
enough
for
skip
to
have
any
real
satisfaction
in
my
companionship
poor
jack
has
never
come
home
we
may
never
know
what
became
of
him
an
interesting
circus
experience
white
house
april
darling
ethel
i
have
heard
a
word
from
the
two
new
horses
and
i
rather
believe
that
if
there
had
been
any
marked
improvement
in
either
of
them
i
should
have
heard
i
gather
that
one
at
least
and
probably
both
would
be
all
right
for
me
if
i
were
twenty
years
younger
and
would
probably
be
all
right
for
ted
now
but
of
course
as
things
are
at
present
i
do
not
want
a
horse
with
which
i
have
an
interesting
circus
experience
whenever
we
meet
an
automobile
or
one
which
i
can
not
get
to
go
in
any
particular
direction
without
devoting
an
hour
or
two
to
the
job
so
that
it
looks
as
if
old
rusty
would
be
good
enough
for
me
for
some
time
to
come
i
am
going
out
on
him
with
senator
lodge
this
afternoon
and
he
will
be
all
right
and
as
fresh
as
paint
for
he
has
been
three
days
in
the
stable
but
is
just
a
glorious
spring
day
march
having
ended
as
it
began
with
rain
and
snow
and
i
will
have
a
good
ride
i
miss
mother
and
you
children
very
much
of
course
but
i
believe
you
are
having
a
good
time
and
i
am
really
glad
you
are
to
see
havana
a
big
and
lonely
white
house
white
house
april
darling
slipper
and
the
kittens
are
doing
finely
i
think
the
kittens
will
be
big
enough
for
you
to
pet
and
have
some
satisfaction
out
of
when
you
get
home
although
they
will
be
pretty
young
still
i
miss
you
all
dreadfully
and
the
house
feels
big
and
lonely
and
full
of
echoes
with
nobody
but
me
in
it
and
i
do
not
hear
any
small
scamps
running
up
and
down
the
hall
just
as
hard
as
they
can
or
hear
their
voices
while
i
am
dressing
or
suddenly
look
out
through
the
windows
of
the
office
at
the
tennis
ground
and
see
them
racing
over
it
or
playing
in
the
i
love
you
very
much
a
new
puppy
and
a
new
horse
white
house
april
dear
kermit
last
night
i
played
tickley
in
their
room
with
the
two
little
boys
as
we
rolled
and
bounced
over
all
three
beds
in
the
course
of
the
play
not
to
mention
frantic
chases
under
them
i
think
poor
mademoiselle
was
rather
appalled
at
the
result
when
we
had
finished
bernard
puppy
has
come
and
it
is
the
dearest
puppy
imaginable
a
huge
soft
thing
which
archie
carries
around
in
his
arms
and
which
the
whole
family
love
yesterday
i
took
a
first
ride
on
the
new
horse
roswell
captain
lee
going
along
on
rusty
as
a
kind
of
a
nurse
roswell
is
not
yet
four
and
he
is
really
a
green
colt
and
not
quite
the
horse
i
want
at
present
as
i
have
time
to
fuss
with
him
and
am
afraid
of
letting
the
sergeant
ride
him
as
he
does
not
get
on
well
with
him
and
there
is
nobody
else
in
our
stable
that
can
ride
at
all
he
is
a
beautiful
horse
a
wonderful
jumper
and
does
not
pull
at
all
he
shies
pretty
badly
especially
when
he
meets
an
automobile
and
when
he
leaves
the
stable
or
strikes
a
road
that
he
thinks
will
take
him
home
and
is
not
allowed
to
go
down
it
he
is
apt
to
rear
which
i
do
not
like
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
he
will
get
over
these
traits
and
if
i
can
arrange
to
have
lee
handle
him
a
couple
of
months
more
and
if
ted
and
i
can
regularly
ride
him
down
at
oyster
bay
i
think
that
he
will
turn
out
all
right
mother
and
i
walk
every
morning
through
the
grounds
which
of
course
are
lovely
not
only
are
the
and
robins
singing
but
the
sparrows
who
will
i
suppose
soon
leave
us
for
the
north
are
still
in
full
song
and
this
morning
they
waked
us
up
at
daybreak
singing
just
outside
the
window
a
quentin
anecdote
white
house
april
dear
kermit
ted
has
been
as
good
and
cunning
as
possible
he
has
completely
recovered
from
the
effects
of
having
his
eye
operated
upon
and
though
the
eye
itself
is
a
somewhat
gruesome
object
ted
is
in
the
highest
spirits
he
goes
back
to
harvard
as
i
write
archie
and
quentin
are
busily
engaged
in
the
and
i
look
out
across
the
at
them
if
ever
there
was
a
treasure
to
small
boys
that
is
the
treasure
it
was
very
cunning
to
see
the
delight
various
little
children
took
in
it
at
the
on
easter
monday
thanks
to
our
decision
in
keeping
out
grown
people
and
stopping
everything
at
one
the
really
was
a
children
festival
and
was
pretty
and
not
objectionable
this
year
the
apple
trees
are
now
coming
into
bloom
including
that
big
arched
apple
tree
under
which
mother
and
i
sit
by
the
fountain
on
the
stone
bench
it
is
the
apple
tree
that
mother
particularly
likes
did
quentin
write
his
poems
after
you
had
gone
i
never
can
recollect
whether
you
have
seen
them
or
not
he
is
a
funny
small
person
if
ever
there
was
one
the
other
day
we
were
discussing
a
really
dreadful
accident
which
had
happened
a
georgetown
young
man
having
taken
out
a
young
girl
in
a
canoe
on
the
river
the
canoe
upset
and
the
girl
was
drowned
whereupon
the
young
man
when
he
got
home
took
what
seemed
to
us
an
exceedingly
method
of
a
special
delivery
letter
to
notify
her
parents
we
were
expressing
our
horror
at
his
sending
a
special
delivery
letter
and
quentin
solemnly
chimed
in
with
yes
he
wasted
ten
cents
there
was
a
moment
eloquent
silence
and
then
we
strove
to
explain
to
quentin
that
what
we
were
objecting
to
was
not
in
the
least
the
young
man
spendthrift
attitude
as
i
walk
to
and
from
the
office
now
the
terrace
is
fairly
fragrant
with
the
scent
of
the
hyacinths
which
mother
has
put
out
in
boxes
on
the
low
stone
walls
a
visit
to
washington
birthplace
white
house
april
dear
kermit
on
saturday
afternoon
mother
and
i
started
off
on
the
mother
having
made
up
her
mind
i
needed
hours
rest
and
we
had
a
delightful
time
together
and
she
was
just
as
cunning
as
she
could
be
on
sunday
mother
and
i
spent
about
four
hours
ashore
taking
our
lunch
and
walking
up
to
the
monument
which
marks
where
the
house
stood
in
which
washington
was
born
it
is
a
simple
shaft
every
vestige
of
the
house
is
destroyed
but
a
curious
and
rather
pathetic
thing
is
that
although
it
must
be
a
hundred
years
since
the
place
was
deserted
there
are
still
multitudes
of
flowers
which
must
have
come
from
those
in
the
old
garden
there
are
iris
and
narcissus
and
a
little
blue
flower
with
a
neat
prim
clean
smell
that
makes
one
feel
as
if
it
ought
to
be
put
with
lavender
into
chests
of
fresh
old
linen
the
narcissus
in
particular
was
growing
around
everywhere
together
with
real
wild
flowers
like
the
painted
columbine
and
star
of
bethlehem
it
was
a
lovely
spot
on
a
headland
overlooking
a
broad
inlet
from
the
potomac
there
was
also
the
old
graveyard
or
grave
plot
in
which
were
the
gravestones
of
washington
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
all
pretty
nearly
ruined
it
was
lovely
warm
weather
and
mother
and
i
enjoyed
our
walk
through
the
funny
lonely
old
country
carolina
wrens
cardinals
and
field
sparrows
were
singing
cheerfully
we
came
up
the
river
in
time
to
get
home
last
evening
this
morning
mother
and
i
walked
around
the
white
house
grounds
as
usual
i
think
i
get
more
fond
of
flowers
every
year
the
grounds
are
now
at
that
high
stage
of
beauty
in
which
they
will
stay
for
the
next
two
months
the
buckeyes
are
in
bloom
the
pink
dogwood
and
the
fragrant
lilacs
which
are
almost
the
loveliest
of
the
bushes
and
then
the
flowers
including
the
i
am
dictating
in
the
office
archie
is
out
by
the
sandbox
playing
with
the
hose
the
playing
consists
in
brandishing
it
around
his
head
and
trying
to
escape
the
falling
water
he
escapes
about
twice
out
of
three
times
and
must
now
be
a
perfect
drowned
rat
i
have
just
had
him
in
to
look
at
him
and
he
is
even
more
of
a
drowned
rat
than
i
supposed
he
has
gone
out
to
complete
his
shower
bath
under
strict
promise
that
immediately
afterwards
he
will
go
in
and
change
his
clothes
quentin
is
the
funniest
mite
you
ever
saw
and
certainly
a
very
original
little
fellow
he
left
at
mademoiselle
plate
yesterday
a
large
bunch
of
flowers
with
the
inscription
that
they
were
from
the
fairies
to
her
to
reward
her
for
taking
care
of
two
boys
ethel
is
a
dear
more
about
dickens
white
house
may
dear
ted
mother
read
us
your
note
and
i
was
interested
in
the
discussion
between
you
and
over
dickens
dickens
characters
are
really
to
a
great
extent
personified
attributes
rather
than
individuals
in
consequence
while
there
are
not
nearly
as
many
who
are
actually
like
people
one
meets
as
for
instance
in
thackeray
there
are
a
great
many
more
who
possess
which
we
encounter
continually
though
rarely
as
strongly
developed
as
in
the
fictional
originals
so
characters
last
almost
as
bunyan
do
for
instance
jefferson
brick
and
elijah
pogram
and
hannibal
chollop
are
all
real
personifications
of
certain
bad
tendencies
in
american
life
and
i
am
continually
thinking
of
or
alluding
to
some
newspaper
editor
or
senator
or
homicidal
rowdy
by
one
of
these
three
names
i
never
met
any
one
exactly
like
uriah
heep
but
now
and
then
we
see
individuals
show
traits
which
make
it
easy
to
describe
them
with
reference
to
those
traits
as
uriah
heep
it
is
just
the
same
with
micawber
nickleby
is
not
quite
a
real
person
but
she
typifies
in
accentuated
form
traits
which
a
great
many
real
persons
possess
and
i
am
continually
thinking
of
her
when
i
meet
them
there
are
half
a
dozen
books
of
dickens
which
have
i
think
furnished
more
characters
which
are
the
constant
companions
of
the
ordinary
educated
man
around
us
than
is
true
of
any
other
volumes
published
within
the
same
period
no
place
like
sagamore
hill
to
ethel
at
sagamore
hill
white
house
june
blessed
ethel
i
am
very
glad
that
what
changes
have
been
made
in
the
house
are
good
and
i
look
forward
so
eagerly
to
seeing
them
after
all
fond
as
i
am
of
the
white
house
and
much
though
i
have
appreciated
these
years
in
it
there
is
any
place
in
the
world
like
home
like
sagamore
hill
where
things
are
our
own
with
our
own
associations
and
where
it
is
real
country
attic
delights
white
house
june
blessed
ethel
your
letter
delighted
me
i
read
it
over
twice
and
chuckled
over
it
by
george
how
entirely
i
sympathize
with
your
feelings
in
the
attic
i
know
just
what
it
is
to
get
up
into
such
a
place
and
find
the
delightful
winding
passages
where
one
lay
hidden
with
thrills
of
criminal
delight
when
the
grownups
were
vainly
demanding
appearance
at
some
legitimate
and
abhorred
function
and
then
the
and
treasures
and
the
emotions
of
peace
and
war
with
reference
to
former
companions
which
they
recall
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
about
the
mental
telepathy
there
is
much
in
it
and
in
kindred
things
which
are
real
and
which
at
present
we
do
not
understand
the
only
trouble
is
that
it
usually
gets
mixed
up
with
all
kinds
of
fakes
i
am
glad
the
band
had
a
healthy
effect
in
reviving
old
youth
i
shall
never
forget
the
intense
interest
in
life
he
always
used
to
gain
when
we
encountered
an
italian
with
a
barrel
organ
and
a
bear
a
combination
that
made
renown
seek
instant
refuge
in
attempted
suicide
i
am
really
pleased
that
you
are
going
to
teach
sunday
school
i
think
i
told
you
that
i
taught
it
for
seven
years
most
of
the
time
in
a
mission
class
my
pupils
being
of
a
kind
which
furnished
me
plenty
of
vigorous
excitement
presidential
rescue
of
a
kitten
white
house
june
darling
ethel
as
i
was
marching
to
church
with
sloane
some
yards
behind
i
suddenly
saw
two
terriers
racing
to
attack
a
kitten
which
was
walking
down
the
sidewalk
i
bounced
forward
with
my
umbrella
and
after
some
active
work
put
to
flight
the
dogs
while
sloane
captured
the
kitten
which
was
a
friendly
helpless
little
thing
evidently
too
well
accustomed
to
being
taken
care
of
to
know
how
to
shift
for
itself
i
inquired
of
all
the
bystanders
and
of
people
on
the
neighboring
porches
to
know
if
they
knew
who
owned
it
but
as
they
all
disclaimed
with
many
grins
any
knowledge
of
it
i
marched
ahead
with
it
in
my
arms
for
about
half
a
block
then
i
saw
a
very
nice
colored
woman
and
little
colored
girl
looking
out
of
the
window
of
a
small
house
with
on
the
door
a
dressmaker
advertisement
and
i
turned
and
walked
up
the
steps
and
asked
if
they
did
not
want
the
kitten
they
said
they
did
and
the
little
girl
welcomed
it
lovingly
so
i
felt
i
had
gotten
it
a
home
and
continued
toward
church
has
the
lordly
ted
turned
up
yet
is
his
loving

quite
severe

is
really
becoming
a
manly
little

archie
is
devoted
to
the
sailboat
the
other
day
while
mother
and
i
were
coming
in
rowing
we
met
him
sailing
out
and
it
was
too
cunning
for
anything
the
looks
exactly
like
a
little
black
wooden
shoe
with
a
sail
in
it
and
the
crew
consisted
of
archie
of
one
of
his
beloved

dear
kermit
archie
is
very
cunning
and
has
handicap
races
with
skip
he
spreads
his
legs
bends
over
and
holds
skip
between
them
then
he
says
on
your
mark
skip
ready
go
and
shoves
skip
back
while
he
runs
as
hard
as
he
possibly
can
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall

scrambling
wildly
with
his
paws
on

smooth
floor
until
he
can

after

white
house
november
dear
kermit
just
a
line
to
tell
you
what
a
nice
time
we
had
at
pine
knot
mother
was
as
happy
as
she
always
is
there
and
as
cunning
and
pretty
as
possible
as
for
me
i
hunted
faithfully
through
all
three
days
leaving
the
house
at
three
one
day
at
four
the
next
and
at
five
the
next
so
that
i
began
my
hunts
in
absolute
night
but
fortunately
we
had
a
brilliant
moon
on
each
occasion
the
first
two
days
were
failures
i
did
not
see
a
turkey
and
on
each
occasion
when
everybody
was
perfectly
certain
that
i
was
going
to
see
a
turkey
something
went
wrong
and
the
turkey
did
not
turn
up
the
last
day
i
was
out
thirteen
hours
and
you
may
imagine
how
hungry
i
was
when
i
got
back
not
to
speak
of
being
tired
though
fortunately
most
of
the
time
i
was
rambling
around
on
horseback
so
i
was
not
done
out
but
in
the
afternoon
at
last
luck
changed
and
then
for
once
everything
went
right
the
hunter
who
was
with
me
marked
a
turkey
in
a
point
of
pines
stretching
down
from
a
forest
into
an
open
valley
with
another
forest
on
its
farther
side
i
ran
down
to
the
end
of
the
point
and
hid
behind
a
bush
he
walked
down
through
the
pines
and
the
turkey
came
out
and
started
to
fly
across
the
valley
offering
me
a
beautiful
side
shot
at
about
yards
just
the
distance
for
my
i
killed
it
dead
and
felt
mighty
happy
as
it
came
tumbling
down
through
the
air
pets
on
shipboard
in
november
the
president
accompanied
by
roosevelt
went
to
the
isthmus
of
panama
where
he
spent
three
days
in
inspecting
the
work
of
building
the
panama
canal
returning
by
way
of
porto
rico
the
journey
was
taken
on
the
naval
vessel
and
many
of
his
letters
to
the
children
were
written
while
on
board
that
vessel
and
mailed
after
reaching
colon
on
board
on
the
way
to
panama
sunday
november
blessed
quentin
you
would
be
amused
at
the
pets
they
have
aboard
this
ship
they
have
two
young
a
cat
three
little
raccoons
and
a
tiny
cuban
goat
they
seem
to
be
very
amicable
with
one
another
although
i
think
the
cat
has
suspicions
of
all
the
rest
the
coons
clamber
about
everywhere
and
the
other
afternoon
while
i
was
sitting
reading
i
suddenly
felt
my
finger
seized
in
a
pair
of
soft
black
paws
and
found
the
coon
sniffing
at
it
making
me
feel
a
little
uncomfortable
lest
it
might
think
the
finger
something
good
to
eat
the
two
puppies
play
endlessly
one
of
them
belongs
to
lieutenant
evans
the
crew
will
not
be
allowed
ashore
at
panama
or
else
i
know
they
would
pick
up
a
whole
raft
of
other
pets
there
the
jackies
seem
especially
fond
of
the
little
coons
a
few
minutes
ago
i
saw
one
of
the
jackies
strolling
about
with
a
coon
perched
upon
his
shoulder
and
now
and
then
he
would
reach
up
his
hand
and
give
it
a
small
piece
of
bread
to
eat
names
of
the
guns
on
board
sunday
november
blessed
archie
i
wish
you
were
along
with
us
for
you
would
thoroughly
enjoy
everything
on
this
ship
we
have
had
three
days
of
perfect
weather
while
this
great
battleship
with
her
two
convoys
the
great
armored
cruisers
and
have
steamed
steadily
in
column
ahead
southward
through
calm
seas
until
now
we
are
in
the
tropics
they
are
three
as
splendid
ships
of
their
class
as
there
are
afloat
save
only
the
english
the
now
has
her
and
everything
is
all
in
good
shape
for
her
to
begin
the
practice
of
the
duties
which
will
make
her
crew
as
fit
for
work
as
the
crew
of
any
one
of
our
other
battleships
the
men
are
such
fellows
americans
of
the
best
type
young
active
vigorous
with
lots
of
intelligence
i
was
much
amused
at
the
names
of
the
guns
which
include
together
with
and
also
one
called
and
one
called
big
reflections
on
the
way
on
board
dear
kermit
so
far
this
trip
has
been
a
great
success
and
i
think
mother
has
really
enjoyed
it
as
for
me
i
of
course
feel
a
little
bored
as
i
always
do
on
shipboard
but
i
have
brought
on
a
great
variety
of
books
and
am
at
this
moment
reading
milton
prose
works
tacitus
and
a
german
novel
called
jorn
uhl
mother
and
i
walk
briskly
up
and
down
the
deck
together
or
else
sit
aft
under
the
awning
or
in
the
after
cabin
with
the
gun
ports
open
and
read
and
i
also
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
on
the
forward
bridge
and
sometimes
on
the
aft
bridge
and
of
course
have
gone
over
the
ship
to
inspect
it
with
the
captain
it
is
a
splendid
thing
to
see
one
of
these
and
it
does
really
make
one
proud
of
one
country
both
the
officers
and
the
enlisted
men
are
as
fine
a
set
as
one
could
wish
to
see
it
is
a
beautiful
sight
these
three
great
standing
southward
in
close
column
and
almost
as
beautiful
at
night
when
we
see
not
only
the
lights
but
the
loom
through
the
darkness
of
the
ships
astern
we
are
now
in
the
tropics
and
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
of
the
time
over
eight
years
ago
when
i
was
sailing
to
santiago
in
the
fleet
of
warships
and
transports
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
think
of
my
now
being
president
going
to
visit
the
work
of
the
panama
canal
which
i
have
made
possible
mother
very
pretty
and
dainty
in
white
summer
clothes
came
up
on
sunday
morning
to
see
inspection
and
review
or
whatever
they
call
it
of
the
men
i
usually
spend
half
an
hour
on
deck
before
mother
is
dressed
then
we
breakfast
together
alone
have
also
taken
lunch
alone
but
at
dinner
have
two
or
three
officers
to
dine
with
us
doctor
rixey
is
along
and
is
a
perfect
dear
as
always
events
since
columbus
discovery
november
the
fourth
day
out
was
in
some
respects
the
most
interesting
all
the
forenoon
we
had
cuba
on
our
right
and
most
of
the
forenoon
and
part
of
the
afternoon
hayti
on
our
left
and
in
each
case
green
jungly
shores
and
bold
mountains
two
great
beautiful
venomous
tropic
islands
these
are
historic
seas
and
mother
and
i
have
kept
thinking
of
all
that
has
happened
in
them
since
columbus
landed
at
san
salvador
which
we
also
saw
the
spanish
explorers
the
buccaneers
the
english
and
dutch
and
adventurers
the
great
english
and
french
fleets
the
desperate
fighting
the
triumphs
the
pestilences
of
all
the
turbulence
the
splendor
and
the
wickedness
and
the
hot
evil
riotous
life
of
the
old
planters
and
spanish
french
english
and
dutch
their
extermination
of
the
indians
and
bringing
in
of
negro
slaves
the
decay
of
most
of
the
islands
the
turning
of
hayti
into
a
land
of
savage
negroes
who
have
reverted
to
voodooism
and
cannibalism
the
effort
we
are
now
making
to
bring
cuba
and
porto
rico
forward
is
calm
and
beautiful
as
all
the
days
have
been
on
our
trip
we
have
just
sighted
the
highest
land
of
panama
ahead
of
us
and
we
shall
be
at
anchor
by
two
this
afternoon
just
a
little
less
than
six
days
from
the
time
we
left
washington
pride
in
america
on
board
dear
ted
i
am
very
glad
to
have
taken
this
trip
although
as
usual
i
am
bored
by
the
sea
everything
has
been
smooth
as
possible
and
it
has
been
lovely
having
mother
along
it
gives
me
great
pride
in
america
to
be
aboard
this
great
battleship
and
to
see
not
only
the
material
perfection
of
the
ship
herself
in
engines
guns
and
all
arrangements
but
the
fine
quality
of
the
officers
and
crew
have
you
ever
read
smollett
novel
i
think
roderick
random
or
humphrey
clinker
in
which
the
hero
goes
to
sea
it
gives
me
an
awful
idea
of
what
a
floating
hell
of
filth
disease
tyranny
and
cruelty
a
was
in
those
days
now
every
arrangement
is
as
clean
and
healthful
as
possible
the
men
can
bathe
and
do
bathe
as
often
as
cleanliness
requires
their
fare
is
excellent
and
they
are
as
a
set
as
can
be
imagined
i
am
no
great
believer
in
the
superiority
of
times
past
and
i
have
no
question
that
the
officers
and
men
of
our
navy
now
are
in
point
of
fighting
capacity
better
than
in
the
times
of
drake
and
nelson
and
morally
and
in
physical
surroundings
the
advantage
is
infinitely
in
our
favor
it
was
delightful
to
have
you
two
or
three
days
at
washington
blessed
old
fellow
you
had
a
pretty
hard
time
in
college
this
fall
but
it
ca
be
helped
ted
as
one
grows
older
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
keep
coming
together
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
grin
and
bear
it
to
flinch
as
little
as
possible
under
the
punishment
and
to
keep
pegging
steadily
away
until
the
luck
turns
what
the
president
saw
at
panama
at
sea
november
dear
kermit
our
visit
to
panama
was
most
successful
as
well
as
most
interesting
we
were
there
three
days
and
we
worked
from
morning
till
night
the
second
day
i
was
up
at
a
quarter
to
six
and
got
to
bed
at
a
quarter
of
twelve
and
i
do
not
believe
that
in
the
intervening
time
save
when
i
was
dressing
there
were
ten
consecutive
minutes
when
i
was
not
busily
at
work
in
some
shape
or
form
for
two
days
there
were
uninterrupted
tropic
rains
without
a
glimpse
of
the
sun
and
the
chagres
river
rose
in
a
flood
higher
than
any
for
fifteen
years
so
that
we
saw
the
climate
at
its
worst
it
was
just
what
i
desired
to
do
it
certainly
adds
to
one
pleasure
to
have
read
history
and
to
appreciate
the
picturesque
when
on
wednesday
we
approached
the
coast
and
the
mountains
looked
clearer
and
clearer
until
we
could
see
the
surf
beating
on
the
shores
while
there
was
hardly
a
sign
of
human
habitation
i
kept
thinking
of
the
four
centuries
of
wild
and
bloody
romance
mixed
with
abject
squalor
and
suffering
which
had
made
up
the
history
of
the
isthmus
until
three
years
ago
i
could
see
balboa
crossing
at
darien
and
the
wars
between
the
spaniards
and
the
indians
and
the
settlement
and
the
building
up
of
the
quaint
walled
spanish
towns
and
the
trade
across
the
seas
by
galleon
and
over
land
by
and
river
canoe
in
gold
and
silver
in
precious
stones
and
then
the
advent
of
the
buccaneers
and
of
the
english
seamen
of
drake
and
frobisher
and
morgan
and
many
many
others
and
the
wild
destruction
they
wrought
then
i
thought
of
the
rebellion
against
the
spanish
dominion
and
the
uninterrupted
and
bloody
wars
that
followed
the
last
occurring
when
i
became
president
wars
the
victorious
heroes
of
which
have
their
pictures
frescoed
on
the
quaint
rooms
of
the
palace
at
panama
city
and
in
similar
palaces
in
all
capitals
of
these
strange
turbulent
little
civilizations
meanwhile
the
panama
railroad
had
been
built
by
americans
over
a
half
century
ago
with
appalling
loss
of
life
so
that
it
is
said
of
course
with
exaggeration
that
every
sleeper
laid
represented
the
death
of
a
man
then
the
french
canal
company
started
work
and
for
two
or
three
years
did
a
good
deal
until
it
became
evident
that
the
task
far
exceeded
its
powers
and
then
to
miscalculation
and
inefficiency
was
added
the
hideous
greed
of
adventurers
trying
each
to
save
something
from
the
general
wreck
and
the
company
closed
with
infamy
and
scandal
now
we
have
taken
hold
of
the
job
we
have
difficulties
with
our
own
people
of
course
i
have
a
doubt
that
it
will
take
a
little
longer
and
cost
a
little
more
than
men
now
appreciate
but
i
believe
that
the
work
is
being
done
with
a
very
high
degree
both
of
efficiency
and
honesty
and
i
am
immensely
struck
by
the
character
of
american
employees
who
are
engaged
not
merely
in
superintending
the
work
but
in
doing
all
the
jobs
that
need
skill
and
intelligence
the
steam
shovels
the
dirt
trains
the
machine
shops
and
the
like
are
all
filled
with
american
engineers
conductors
machinists
carpenters
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
these
men
are
so
hardy
so
efficient
so
energetic
that
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
look
at
them
stevens
the
head
engineer
is
a
big
fellow
a
man
of
daring
and
good
sense
and
burly
power
all
of
these
men
are
quite
as
formidable
and
would
if
it
were
necessary
do
quite
as
much
in
battle
as
the
crews
of
drake
and
morgan
but
as
it
is
they
are
doing
a
work
of
infinitely
more
lasting
consequence
nothing
whatever
remains
to
show
what
drake
and
morgan
did
they
produced
no
real
effect
down
here
but
stevens
and
his
men
are
changing
the
face
of
the
continent
are
doing
the
greatest
engineering
feat
of
the
ages
and
the
effect
of
their
work
will
be
felt
while
our
civilization
lasts
i
went
over
everything
that
i
could
possibly
go
over
in
the
time
at
my
disposal
i
examined
the
quarters
of
married
and
single
men
white
men
and
negroes
i
went
over
the
ground
of
the
gatun
and
la
boca
dams
went
through
panama
and
colon
and
spent
a
day
in
the
culebra
cut
where
the
great
work
is
being
done
there
the
huge
are
hard
at
it
scooping
huge
masses
of
rock
and
gravel
and
dirt
previously
loosened
by
the
drillers
and
dynamite
blasters
loading
it
on
trains
which
take
it
away
to
some
dump
either
in
the
jungle
or
where
the
dams
are
to
be
built
they
are
eating
steadily
into
the
mountain
cutting
it
down
and
down
little
tracks
are
laid
on
the
rocks
blasted
out
and
the
great
ton
work
up
like
mountain
howitzers
until
they
come
to
where
they
can
with
advantage
begin
their
work
of
eating
into
and
destroying
the
mountainside
with
intense
energy
men
and
machines
do
their
task
the
white
men
supervising
matters
and
handling
the
machines
while
the
tens
of
thousands
of
black
men
do
the
rough
manual
labor
where
it
is
not
worth
while
to
have
machines
do
it
it
is
an
epic
feat
and
one
of
immense
significance
the
deluge
of
rain
meant
that
many
of
the
villages
were
in
water
while
the
flooded
rivers
tore
through
the
tropic
forests
it
is
a
real
tropic
forest
palms
and
bananas
breadfruit
trees
bamboos
lofty
ceibas
and
gorgeous
butterflies
and
brilliant
colored
birds
fluttering
among
the
orchids
there
are
beautiful
flowers
too
all
my
old
enthusiasm
for
natural
history
seemed
to
revive
and
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
have
stayed
and
tried
to
collect
specimens
it
would
be
a
good
hunting
country
too
deer
and
now
and
then
jaguars
and
tapir
and
great
birds
that
they
call
wild
turkeys
there
are
alligators
in
the
rivers
one
of
the
trained
nurses
from
a
hospital
went
to
bathe
in
a
pool
last
august
and
an
alligator
grabbed
him
by
the
legs
and
was
making
off
with
him
but
was
fortunately
scared
away
leaving
the
man
badly
injured
i
tramped
everywhere
through
the
mud
mother
did
not
do
the
roughest
work
and
had
time
to
see
more
of
the
really
picturesque
and
beautiful
side
of
the
life
and
really
enjoyed
herself
the
gatun
dam
will
make
a
lake
miles
long
and
the
railroad
now
goes
on
what
will
be
the
bottom
of
this
lake
and
it
was
curious
to
think
that
in
a
few
years
great
ships
would
be
floating
in
water
feet
above
where
we
were
on
the
way
to
porto
rico
at
sea
november
dear
ted
this
is
the
third
day
out
from
panama
we
have
been
steaming
steadily
in
the
teeth
of
the
trade
wind
it
has
blown
pretty
hard
and
the
ship
has
pitched
a
little
but
not
enough
to
make
either
mother
or
me
uncomfortable
panama
was
a
great
sight
in
the
first
place
it
was
strange
and
beautiful
with
its
mass
of
luxuriant
tropic
jungle
with
the
treacherous
tropic
rivers
trailing
here
and
there
through
it
and
it
was
lovely
to
see
the
orchids
and
brilliant
butterflies
and
the
strange
birds
and
snakes
and
lizards
and
finally
the
strange
old
spanish
towns
and
the
queer
thatch
and
bamboo
huts
of
the
ordinary
natives
in
the
next
place
it
is
a
tremendous
sight
to
see
the
work
on
the
canal
going
on
from
the
chief
engineer
and
the
chief
sanitary
officer
down
to
the
last
arrived
machinist
or
the
five
thousand
americans
at
work
on
the
isthmus
seemed
to
me
an
exceptionally
able
energetic
lot
some
of
them
grumbling
of
course
but
on
the
whole
a
mighty
good
lot
of
men
the
west
indian
negroes
offer
a
greater
problem
but
they
are
doing
pretty
well
also
i
was
astonished
at
the
progress
made
we
spent
the
three
days
in
working
from
dawn
until
long
after
darkness
dear
rixey
being
of
course
my
faithful
companion
mother
would
see
all
she
liked
and
then
would
go
off
on
a
little
spree
by
herself
and
she
enjoyed
it
to
the
full
what
he
saw
in
porto
rico
at
sea
november
dear
kermit
we
had
a
most
interesting
two
days
at
porto
rico
we
landed
on
the
south
side
of
the
island
and
were
received
by
the
governor
and
the
rest
of
the
administration
including
nice
laurance
grahame
then
were
given
a
reception
by
the
alcalde
and
people
of
ponce
and
then
went
straight
across
the
island
in
automobiles
to
san
juan
on
the
north
shore
it
was
an
eighty
mile
trip
and
really
delightful
the
road
wound
up
to
the
high
mountains
of
the
middle
island
through
them
and
then
down
again
to
the
flat
plain
on
the
north
shore
the
scenery
was
beautiful
it
was
as
thoroughly
tropical
as
panama
but
much
more
livable
there
were
palms
bananas
mangoes
bamboos
and
many
other
trees
and
multitudes
of
brilliant
flowers
there
was
one
vine
called
the
with
flowers
as
big
as
great
white
which
close
up
tight
in
the
and
bloom
at
night
there
were
vines
with
masses
of
brilliant
purple
and
pink
flowers
and
others
with
masses
of
little
white
flowers
which
at
smell
deliciously
there
were
trees
studded
over
with
huge
white
flowers
and
others
the
flamboyants
such
as
i
saw
in
the
campaign
at
santiago
are
a
mass
of
large
scarlet
blossoms
in
june
but
which
now
had
shed
them
i
thought
the
especially
beautiful
the
towns
were
just
such
as
you
saw
in
cuba
quaint
brilliantly
colored
with
the
old
church
or
cathedral
fronting
the
plaza
and
the
plaza
always
full
of
flowers
of
course
the
towns
are
dirty
but
they
are
not
nearly
as
dirty
and
offensive
as
those
of
italy
and
there
is
something
pathetic
and
childlike
about
the
people
we
are
giving
them
a
good
government
and
the
island
is
prospering
i
never
saw
a
finer
set
of
young
fellows
than
those
engaged
in
the
administration
grahame
whom
of
course
you
remember
is
the
intimate
friend
and
ally
of
the
leaders
of
the
administration
that
is
of
governor
beekman
winthrop
and
of
the
secretary
of
state
regis
post
grahame
is
a
perfect
trump
and
such
a
handsome
athletic
fellow
and
a
real
sir
galahad
any
and
especially
any
cruelty
makes
him
flame
with
fearless
indignation
he
perfectly
delighted
the
porto
ricans
and
also
immensely
puzzled
them
by
coming
in
his
scotch
kilt
to
a
government
ball
accordingly
at
my
special
request
i
had
him
wear
his
kilt
at
the
state
dinner
and
reception
the
night
we
were
at
the
palace
you
know
he
is
a
descendant
of
montrose
and
although
born
in
canada
his
parents
were
scotch
and
he
was
educated
in
scotland
do
tell
bob
fergie
about
him
and
his
kilts
when
you
next
write
him
we
spent
the
night
at
the
palace
which
is
half
palace
and
half
castle
and
was
the
residence
of
the
old
spanish
governors
it
is
nearly
four
hundred
years
old
and
is
a
delightful
building
with
quaint
gardens
and
a
quaint
looking
over
the
bay
there
were
colored
lanterns
lighting
up
the
gardens
for
the
reception
and
the
view
across
the
bay
in
the
moonlight
was
lovely
our
rooms
were
as
attractive
as
possible
too
except
that
they
were
so
very
airy
and
open
that
we
found
it
difficult
to
sleep
not
that
that
much
mattered
as
thanks
to
the
earliness
of
our
start
and
the
lateness
of
our
reception
we
had
barely
four
hours
in
which
we
even
tried
to
sleep
the
next
morning
we
came
back
in
automobiles
over
different
and
even
more
beautiful
roads
the
mountain
passes
through
and
over
which
we
went
made
us
feel
as
if
we
were
in
a
tropic
switzerland
we
had
to
cross
two
or
three
rivers
where
big
oxen
with
yokes
tied
to
their
horns
pulled
the
automobiles
through
the
water
at
one
funny
little
village
we
had
an
open
air
lunch
very
good
of
chicken
and
eggs
and
bread
and
some
wine
contributed
by
a
wealthy
young
spaniard
who
rode
up
from
a
neighboring
coffee
ranch
yesterday
afternoon
we
embarked
again
and
that
evening
the
crew
gave
a
theatrical
entertainment
on
the
afterdeck
closing
with
three
boxing
bouts
i
send
you
the
program
it
was
great
fun
the
audience
being
equally
enraptured
with
the
sentimental
songs
about
the
flag
and
the
sailor
true
love
and
his
mother
and
with
the
jokes
the
most
relished
of
which
related
to
the
fact
that
were
supposed
to
be
so
large
that
they
had
to
be
shot
and
the
skits
about
the
commissary
and
various
persons
and
deeds
on
the
ship
in
a
way
the
freedom
of
comment
reminded
me
a
little
of
the
roman
triumphs
when
the
excellent
legendaries
recited
in
verse
and
prose
anything
they
chose
concerning
the
hero
in
whose
deeds
they
had
shared
and
whose
triumphs
they
were
celebrating
the
stage
well
lighted
was
built
on
the
aftermost
part
of
the
deck
we
sat
in
front
with
the
officers
and
the
sailors
behind
us
in
masses
on
the
deck
on
the
aftermost
turrets
on
the
bridge
and
even
in
the
fighting
top
of
the
aftermost
mast
it
was
interesting
to
see
their
faces
in
the
light
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
banners
and
inscriptions
of
welcome
to
me
in
porto
rico
one
of
them
which
stretched
across
the
road
had
on
it
welcome
to
theodore
and
mrs
roosevelt
last
evening
i
really
enjoyed
a
rather
funny
experience
there
is
an
army
and
navy
union
composed
chiefly
of
enlisted
men
but
also
of
many
officers
and
they
suddenly
held
a
garrison
meeting
in
the
of
this
ship
there
were
about
fifty
enlisted
men
together
with
the
captain
and
myself
i
was
introduced
as
comrade
and
shipmate
theodore
roosevelt
president
of
the
united
states
they
were
such
a
nice
set
of
fellows
and
i
was
really
so
pleased
to
be
with
them
so
so
earnest
and
just
the
right
type
out
of
which
to
make
the
typical
american
fighting
man
who
is
also
a
good
citizen
the
meeting
reminded
me
a
good
deal
of
a
lodge
meeting
at
oyster
bay
and
of
course
those
men
are
fundamentally
of
the
same
type
as
the
shipwrights
railroad
men
and
fishermen
whom
i
met
at
the
lodge
and
who
by
the
way
are
my
chief
backers
politically
and
are
the
men
who
make
up
the
real
strength
of
this
nation
sickness
of
archie
white
house
march
dear
kermit
poor
little
archie
has
diphtheria
and
we
have
had
a
wearing
hours
of
course
it
is
harder
upon
mother
a
good
deal
than
upon
me
because
she
spends
her
whole
time
with
him
together
with
the
trained
nurse
while
i
simply
must
attend
to
my
work
during
these
closing
hours
of
congress
i
have
worked
each
day
steadily
up
to
half
past
seven
and
also
in
the
evening
and
only
see
archiekins
for
twenty
minutes
or
a
half
hour
before
dinner
the
poor
little
fellow
likes
to
have
me
put
my
hands
on
his
forehead
for
he
says
they
smell
so
clean
and
soapy
last
night
he
was
very
sick
but
this
morning
he
is
better
and
rixey
thinks
everything
is
going
well
lambert
is
coming
on
this
afternoon
to
see
him
ethel
who
is
away
at
philadelphia
will
be
sent
to
stay
with
the
rixeys
quentin
who
has
been
exposed
somewhat
to
infection
is
not
allowed
to
see
other
little
boys
and
is
leading
a
career
of
splendid
isolation
among
the
ushers
and
policemen
since
i
got
back
here
i
have
not
done
a
thing
except
work
as
the
president
must
during
the
closing
days
of
a
session
of
congress
mother
was
fortunately
getting
much
better
but
now
of
course
is
having
a
very
hard
time
of
it
nursing
darling
little
archie
he
is
just
as
good
as
gold
so
patient
and
loving
yesterday
that
scamp
quentin
said
to
mademoiselle
if
only
i
had
nature
and
head
it
be
great
in
all
his
sickness
archie
remembered
that
was
birthday
and
sent
her
his
love
and
congratulations
which
promptly
reduced
good
mademoiselle
to
tears
at
the
jamestown
exposition
white
house
april
dearest
kermit
we
really
had
an
enjoyable
trip
to
jamestown
the
guests
were
friend
johnson
a
virginia
lady
who
reminds
me
so
much
of
aunt
annie
my
mother
sister
who
throughout
my
childhood
was
almost
as
much
associated
in
our
home
life
as
my
mother
herself
justice
moody
who
was
as
delightful
as
he
always
is
and
with
whom
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
again
have
a
chance
to
talk
and
bob
bacon
who
proved
the
very
nicest
guests
of
all
and
were
companionable
and
sympathetic
at
every
point
ethel
was
as
good
as
gold
and
took
much
off
of
mother
shoulders
in
the
way
of
taking
care
of
quentin
archie
and
quentin
had
of
course
a
heavenly
time
went
everywhere
below
and
aloft
and
ate
indifferently
at
all
hours
both
with
the
officers
and
enlisted
men
we
left
here
thursday
afternoon
and
on
friday
morning
passed
in
review
through
the
foreign
fleet
and
our
own
fleet
of
sixteen
great
battleships
in
addition
to
cruisers
it
was
an
inspiring
sight
and
one
i
would
not
have
missed
for
a
great
deal
then
we
went
in
a
launch
to
the
exposition
where
i
had
the
usual
experience
in
such
cases
made
the
usual
speech
held
the
usual
reception
went
to
the
usual
lunch
etc
in
the
evening
mother
and
i
got
on
the
and
went
to
norfolk
to
dine
when
the
landed
we
were
met
by
general
grant
to
convoy
us
to
the
house
i
was
finishing
dressing
and
mother
went
out
into
the
cabin
and
sat
down
to
receive
him
in
a
minute
or
two
i
came
out
and
began
to
hunt
for
my
hat
mother
sat
very
erect
and
pretty
looking
at
my
efforts
with
a
tolerance
that
gradually
changed
to
impatience
finally
she
arose
to
get
her
own
cloak
and
then
i
found
that
she
had
been
sitting
gracefully
but
firmly
on
the
hat
herself
it
was
a
crush
hat
and
it
had
been
flattened
until
it
looked
like
a
wrinkled
pie
mother
did
not
see
what
she
had
done
so
i
speechlessly
thrust
the
hat
toward
her
but
she
still
did
not
understand
and
took
it
as
an
inexplicable
jest
of
mine
merely
saying
yes
dear
and
with
patient
dignity
turned
and
went
out
of
the
door
with
general
grant
the
next
morning
we
went
on
the
up
the
james
river
and
on
the
return
trip
visited
three
of
the
dearest
places
you
can
imagine
shirley
westover
and
brandon
i
do
not
know
whether
i
loved
most
the
places
themselves
or
the
quaint
virginia
gentlewomen
in
them
the
houses
the
grounds
the
owners
all
were
too
dear
for
anything
and
we
loved
them
that
night
we
went
back
to
the
and
returned
here
yesterday
sunday
afternoon
spring
weather
seems
really
to
have
begun
and
after
lunch
mother
and
i
sat
under
the
by
the
fountain
a
purple
finch
was
singing
in
the
overhead
and
the
white
petals
of
the
blossoms
were
silently
falling
this
afternoon
mother
and
i
are
going
out
riding
with
senator
lodge
general
kuroki
white
house
may
dear
kermit
general
kuroki
and
his
suite
are
here
and
dined
with
us
at
a
formal
dinner
last
evening
everything
that
he
says
has
to
be
translated
but
nevertheless
i
had
a
really
interesting
talk
with
him
because
i
am
pretty
well
acquainted
with
his
campaigns
he
impressed
me
much
as
indeed
all
japanese
military
and
naval
officers
do
they
are
a
formidable
outfit
i
want
to
try
to
keep
on
the
best
possible
terms
with
japan
and
never
do
her
any
wrong
but
i
want
still
more
to
see
our
navy
maintained
at
the
highest
point
of
efficiency
for
it
is
the
real
keeper
of
the
peace
temporary
absence
of
skip
the
other
day
pete
got
into
a
most
fearful
fight
and
was
dreadfully
bitten
he
was
a
very
forlorn
dog
indeed
when
he
came
home
and
on
that
particular
day
skip
disappeared
and
had
not
turned
up
when
we
went
to
bed
poor
archie
was
very
uneasy
lest
skip
should
have
gone
the
way
of
jack
and
mother
and
i
shared
his
uneasiness
but
about
two
in
the
morning
we
both
of
us
heard
a
sharp
little
bark
and
knew
it
was
skip
anxious
to
be
let
in
so
down
i
went
and
opened
the
door
on
the
portico
and
skip
simply
scuttled
in
and
up
to
archie
room
where
archie
waked
up
enough
to
receive
him
literally
with
open
arms
and
then
went
to
sleep
cuddled
up
to
him
death
of
skip
sagamore
hill
blessed
archiekins
we
felt
dreadfully
homesick
as
you
and
kermit
drove
away
when
we
pass
along
the
bay
front
we
always
think
of
the
dory
and
we
mourn
dear
little
skip
although
perhaps
it
was
as
well
the
little
doggie
should
pass
painlessly
away
after
his
happy
little
life
for
the
little
fellow
would
have
pined
for
you
your
letter
was
a
great
comfort
we
send
on
the
football
suit
and
hope
you
enjoy
the
football
of
course
it
will
all
be
new
and
rather
hard
at
first
the
house
is
put
up
everything
wrapped
in
white
that
can
be
and
all
the
rugs
off
the
floors
quentin
is
reduced
to
the
secret
service
men
for
steady
companionship
quentin
snake
adventure
white
house
dearest
archie
before
we
left
oyster
bay
quentin
had
collected
two
snakes
he
lost
one
which
did
not
turn
up
again
until
an
hour
before
departure
when
he
found
it
in
one
of
the
spare
rooms
this
one
he
left
loose
and
brought
the
other
one
to
washington
there
being
a
variety
of
exciting
adventures
on
the
way
the
snake
wriggling
out
of
his
box
once
and
being
upset
on
the
floor
once
the
first
day
home
quentin
was
allowed
not
to
go
to
school
but
to
go
about
and
renew
all
his
friendships
among
other
places
that
he
visited
was
schmid
animal
store
where
he
left
his
little
snake
schmid
presented
him
with
three
snakes
simply
to
pass
the
day
with
a
large
and
beautiful
and
very
friendly
king
snake
and
two
little
wee
snakes
quentin
came
hurrying
back
on
his
roller
skates
and
burst
into
the
room
to
show
me
his
treasures
i
was
discussing
certain
matters
with
the
at
the
time
and
the
snakes
were
eagerly
deposited
in
my
lap
the
king
snake
by
the
way
although
most
friendly
with
quentin
had
just
been
making
a
resolute
effort
to
devour
one
of
the
smaller
snakes
as
quentin
and
his
menagerie
were
an
interruption
to
my
interview
with
the
department
of
justice
i
suggested
that
he
go
into
the
next
room
where
four
congressmen
were
drearily
waiting
until
i
should
be
at
leisure
i
thought
that
he
and
his
snakes
would
probably
enliven
their
waiting
time
he
at
once
fell
in
with
the
suggestion
and
rushed
up
to
the
congressmen
with
the
assurance
that
he
would
there
find
kindred
spirits
they
at
first
thought
the
snakes
were
wooden
ones
and
there
was
some
perceptible
recoil
when
they
realized
that
they
were
alive
then
the
king
snake
went
up
quentin
sleeve
he
was
three
or
four
feet
long
and
we
hesitated
to
drag
him
back
because
his
scales
rendered
that
difficult
the
last
i
saw
of
quentin
one
congressman
was
gingerly
helping
him
off
with
his
jacket
so
as
to
let
the
snake
crawl
out

dearest
ethel
the
first
part
of
my
trip
up
to
the
time
that
we
embarked
on
the
river
at
keokuk
was
just
about
in
the
ordinary
style
i
had
continually
to
rush
out
to
wave
at
the
people
at
the
towns
through
which
the
train
passed
if
the
train
stopped
anywhere
i
had
to
make
a
very
short
speech
to
several
hundred
people
who
evidently
thought
they
liked
me
and
whom
i
really
liked
but
to
whom
i
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
at
canton
and
keokuk
i
went
through
the
usual
solemn
festivities
the
committee
of
reception
and
the
guard
of
honor
with
the
open
carriage
the
lines
of
enthusiastic
to
whom
i
bowed
continually
right
and
left
the
speech
which
in
each
case
i
thought
went
off
rather
better
than
i
had
dared
hope
for
i
felt
as
if
i
had
spoken
myself
out
when
i
got
on
the
boat
however
times
grew
easier
i
still
have
to
rush
out
continually
stand
on
the
front
part
of
the
deck
and
wave
at
groups
of
people
on
shore
and
at
steamboats
draped
with
american
flags
and
loaded
with
enthusiastic
excursionists
but
i
have
a
great
deal
of
time
to
myself
and
by
gentle
firmness
i
think
i
have
succeeded
in
impressing
on
my
good
hosts
that
i
rather
resent
allopathic
doses
of
information
about
shoals
and
dykes
the
amount
of
sand
per
cubic
foot
of
water
the
quantity
of
manufactures
supplied
by
each
river
town
etc
changes
of
three
centuries
on
board
october
dear
kermit
after
speaking
at
keokuk
this
morning
we
got
aboard
this
brand
new
steamer
of
the
regular
mississippi
type
and
started
i
went
up
on
the
texas
and
of
course
felt
an
almost
irresistible
desire
to
ask
the
pilot
about
mark
twain
it
is
a
broad
shallow
muddy
river
at
places
the
channel
being
barely
wide
enough
for
the
boat
to
go
through
though
to
my
inexperienced
eyes
the
whole
river
looks
like
a
channel
the
bottom
lands
illinois
on
one
side
and
missouri
on
the
other
are
sometimes
with
forests
and
sometimes
great
rich
cornfields
with
here
and
there
a
house
here
and
there
villages
and
now
and
then
a
little
town
at
every
such
place
all
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
have
gathered
to
greet
me
the
of
the
towns
would
be
filled
with
a
dense
packed
mass
of
men
women
and
children
waving
flags
the
little
villages
have
not
only
their
own
population
but
also
the
farmers
who
have
driven
in
in
their
wagons
with
their
wives
and
children
from
a
dozen
miles
back
just
such
farmers
as
came
to
see
you
and
the
cavalry
on
your
march
through
iowa
last
summer
it
is
my
first
trip
on
the
mississippi
and
i
am
greatly
interested
in
it
how
wonderful
in
its
rapidity
of
movement
has
been
the
history
of
our
country
compared
with
the
history
of
the
old
world
for
untold
ages
this
river
had
been
flowing
through
the
lonely
continent
not
very
greatly
changed
since
the
close
of
the
pleistocene
during
all
these
myriads
of
years
the
prairie
and
the
forest
came
down
to
its
banks
the
immense
herds
of
the
buffalo
and
the
elk
wandered
along
them
season
after
season
and
the
indian
hunters
on
foot
or
in
canoes
trudged
along
the
banks
or
skimmed
the
water
probably
a
thousand
years
saw
no
change
that
would
have
been
noticeable
to
our
eyes
then
three
centuries
ago
began
the
work
of
change
for
a
century
its
effects
were
not
perceptible
just
nothing
but
an
occasional
french
fleet
or
wild
half
savage
explorer
passing
up
or
down
the
river
or
one
of
its
branches
in
an
indian
canoe
then
the
first
faint
changes
the
building
of
one
or
two
little
french
fur
traders
hamlets
the
passing
of
one
or
two
british
officers
boats
and
the
very
rare
appearance
of
the
uncouth
american
backwoodsman
then
the
change
came
with
a
rush
our
settlers
reached
the
of
the
ohio
and
flatboats
and
began
to
go
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
and
the
indians
and
the
game
they
followed
began
their
last
great
march
to
the
west
for
ages
they
had
marched
back
and
forth
but
from
this
march
there
was
never
to
be
a
return
then
the
day
of
steamboat
traffic
began
and
the
growth
of
the
first
american
cities
and
states
along
the
river
with
their
strength
and
their
squalor
and
their
raw
pride
then
this
mighty
steamboat
traffic
passed
its
zenith
and
collapsed
and
for
a
generation
the
river
towns
have
dwindled
compared
with
the
towns
which
took
their
importance
from
the
growth
of
the
railroads
i
think
of
it
all
as
i
pass
down
the
river
october
we
are
steaming
down
the
river
now
between
tennessee
and
arkansas
the
forest
comes
down
a
little
denser
to
the
bank
the
houses
do
not
look
quite
so
well
kept
otherwise
there
is
not
much
change
there
are
a
dozen
steamers
accompanying
us
filled
with
delegates
from
various
river
cities
the
people
are
all
out
on
the
banks
to
greet
us
still
moreover
at
night
no
matter
what
the
hour
is
that
we
pass
a
town
it
is
generally
illuminated
and
sometimes
whistles
and
noisy
greetings
while
our
steamboats
whistle
in
equally
noisy
response
so
that
our
sleep
is
apt
to
be
broken
seventeen
governors
of
different
states
are
along
in
a
boat
by
themselves
i
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
them
however
and
it
has
been
of
real
use
to
me
especially
as
regards
two
or
three
problems
that
are
up
at
louis
there
was
an
enormous
multitude
of
people
out
to
see
us
the
procession
was
in
a
drenching
rain
in
which
i
stood
bareheaded
smiling
affably
and
waving
my
drowned
hat
to
those
hardy
members
of
the
crowd
who
declined
to
go
to
shelter
at
cairo
i
was
also
greeted
with
great
enthusiasm
and
i
was
interested
to
find
that
there
was
still
extreme
bitterness
felt
over
description
of
the
town
and
the
people
in
martin
chuzzlewit
years
ago
peculiarities
of
mississippi
steamboats
on
board
dear
archie
i
am
now
on
what
i
believe
will
be
my
last
trip
of
any
consequence
while
i
am
president
until
i
got
to
keokuk
iowa
it
was
about
like
any
other
trip
but
it
is
now
pleasant
going
down
the
mississippi
though
i
admit
that
i
would
rather
be
at
home
we
are
on
a
funny
steamer
john
mcilhenny
is
with
me
and
capt
seth
bullock
among
others
we
have
seen
wild
geese
and
ducks
and
cormorants
on
the
river
and
the
people
everywhere
come
out
in
boats
and
throng
or
cluster
on
the
banks
to
greet
us
october
you
would
be
greatly
amused
at
these
steamboats
and
i
think
you
will
like
your
trip
up
the
mississippi
next
spring
if
only
everything
goes
right
and
mother
is
able
to
make
it
there
is
no
hold
to
the
boat
just
a
flat
bottom
with
a
deck
and
on
this
deck
a
foot
or
so
above
the
water
stands
the
completely
open
at
the
sides
and
all
the
machinery
visible
as
you
come
up
to
the
boat
both
ends
are
blunt
and
the
gangways
are
drawn
up
to
big
cranes
of
course
the
boats
could
not
stand
any
kind
of
a
sea
but
here
they
are
very
useful
for
they
are
shallow
and
do
not
get
hurt
when
they
bump
into
the
bank
or
one
another
the
river
runs
down
in
a
broad
swirling
brown
current
and
nobody
but
an
expert
could
tell
the
channel
one
pilot
or
another
is
up
in
the
all
day
long
and
all
night
now
the
channel
goes
close
under
one
bank
then
we
have
to
cross
the
river
and
go
under
the
other
bank
then
there
will
come
a
deep
spot
when
we
can
go
anywhere
then
we
wind
in
and
out
among
shoals
and
at
night
the
steamers
are
all
lighted
up
for
there
are
a
dozen
of
them
in
company
with
us
it
is
nice
to
look
back
at
them
as
they
twist
after
us
in
a
long
winding
line
down
the
river
the
lone
cat
of
the
camp
stamboul
darling
quentin
when
we
shifted
camp
we
came
down
here
and
found
a
funny
little
wooden
shanty
put
up
by
some
people
who
now
and
then
come
out
here
and
sleep
in
it
when
they
fish
or
shoot
the
only
living
thing
around
it
was
a
she
was
most
friendly
and
pleasant
and
we
found
that
she
had
been
living
here
for
two
years
when
people
were
in
the
neighborhood
she
would
take
what
scraps
she
could
get
but
the
rest
of
the
time
she
would
catch
her
own
game
for
herself
she
was
pretty
thin
when
we
came
and
has
already
fattened
visibly
she
was
not
in
the
least
disconcerted
by
the
appearance
of
the
hounds
and
none
of
them
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
her
when
she
wandered
about
among
them
we
are
camped
on
the
edge
of
a
lake
this
morning
before
breakfast
i
had
a
good
swim
in
it
the
water
being
warmer
than
the
air
and
this
evening
i
rowed
on
it
in
the
moonlight
every
night
we
hear
the
great
owls
hoot
and
laugh
in
uncanny
fashion
camp
on
tenesas
bayou
darling
ethel
here
we
are
in
camp
it
is
very
picturesque
and
as
comfortable
as
possible
we
have
a
big
fly
tent
for
the
horses
the
hounds
sleep
with
them
or
with
the
donkeys
there
is
a
white
hunter
ben
lily
who
has
just
joined
us
who
is
a
really
remarkable
character
he
literally
lives
in
the
woods
he
joined
us
early
this
morning
with
one
dog
he
had
tramped
for
hours
through
the
woods
without
food
or
water
and
had
slept
a
couple
of
hours
in
a
crooked
tree
like
a
wild
turkey
he
has
a
mild
gentle
face
blue
eyes
and
full
beard
he
is
a
religious
fanatic
and
is
as
hardy
as
a
bear
or
elk
literally
caring
nothing
for
fatigue
and
exposure
which
we
could
stand
at
all
he
does
seem
to
consider
the
hours
trip
he
has
just
made
any
more
than
i
should
a
half
hour
walk
before
breakfast
he
quotes
the
preacher
talmage
continually
this
is
a
black
belt
the
people
are
almost
all
negroes
curious
creatures
some
of
them
with
indian
blood
like
those
in
voodoo
tales
yesterday
we
met
two
little
negresses
riding
one
mule
with
a
rope
bridle
tenesas
bayou
blessed
archie
i
just
loved
your
letter
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
from
you
i
was
afraid
you
would
have
trouble
with
your
latin
what
a
funny
little
fellow
opdyke
must
be
i
am
glad
you
like
him
how
do
you
get
on
at
football
we
have
found
no
bear
i
shot
a
deer
i
sent
a
picture
of
it
to
kermit
a
small
boy
here
caught
several
wildcats
when
one
was
in
the
trap
he
would
push
a
box
towards
it
and
it
would
itself
get
into
it
to
hide
and
so
he
would
capture
it
alive
but
one
instead
of
getting
into
the
box
combed
the
hair
of
the
small
boy
we
have
a
great
many
hounds
in
camp
at
night
they
gaze
solemnly
into
the
fire
lambert
has
caught
a
good
many
bass
which
we
have
enjoyed
at
the
camp
table
bear
bayou
darling
archie
we
have
had
no
luck
with
the
bear
but
we
have
killed
as
many
deer
as
we
needed
for
meat
and
the
hounds
caught
a
wildcat
our
camp
is
as
comfortable
as
possible
and
we
have
great
camp
fires
at
night
one
of
the
planters
with
me
told
me
he
once
saw
a
bear
when
overtaken
by
the
hounds
lie
down
flat
on
its
back
with
all
its
legs
stretched
out
while
the
dogs
barked
furiously
all
around
it
suddenly
the
bear
sat
up
with
a
jump
and
frightened
all
the
dogs
so
that
they
nearly
turned
back
somersaults
at
this
camp
there
is
a
nice
tame
which
lies
out
here
all
the
time
catching
birds
mice
or
lizards
but
very
friendly
with
any
party
of
hunters
which
happens
along
i
have
just
killed
a
bear
i
have
written
kermit
about
it
the
bear
plays
dead
the
bear
sits
up
shooting
the
bear
en
route
to
washington
dear
ted
bad
old
father
is
coming
back
after
a
successful
trip
it
was
a
success
in
every
way
including
the
bear
hunt
but
in
the
case
of
the
bear
hunt
we
only
just
made
it
successful
and
no
more
for
it
was
not
until
the
twelfth
day
of
steady
hunting
that
i
got
my
bear
then
i
shot
it
in
the
most
approved
hunter
style
going
up
on
it
in
a
canebrake
as
it
made
a
walking
bay
before
the
dogs
i
also
killed
a
deer
more
by
luck
than
anything
else
as
it
was
a
difficult
shot
quentin
exquisite
jest
white
house
dear
archie
friday
night
quentin
had
three
friends
including
the
little
taft
boy
to
spend
the
night
with
him
they
passed
an
evening
and
night
of
delirious
rapture
it
being
a
continuous
save
when
they
would
fall
asleep
for
an
hour
or
two
from
sheer
exhaustion
i
interfered
but
once
and
that
was
to
stop
an
exquisite
jest
of
quentin
which
consisted
in
procuring
sulphureted
hydrogen
to
be
used
on
the
other
boys
when
they
got
into
bed
they
played
hard
and
it
made
me
realize
how
old
i
had
grown
and
how
very
busy
i
had
been
these
last
few
years
to
find
that
they
had
grown
so
that
i
was
not
needed
in
the
play
do
you
recollect
how
we
all
of
us
used
to
play
in
the
white
house
and
have
obstacle
races
down
the
hall
when
you
brought
in
your
friends
mother
continues
much
attached
to
scamp
who
is
certainly
a
cunning
little
dog
he
is
very
affectionate
but
so
exceedingly
busy
when
we
are
out
on
the
grounds
that
we
only
catch
glimpses
of
him
zigzagging
at
full
speed
from
one
end
of
the
place
to
the
other
the
kitchen
cat
and
he
have
strained
relations
but
have
not
yet
come
to
open
hostility
white
house
dear
archie
scamp
is
really
a
cunning
little
dog
but
he
takes
such
an
extremely
keen
interest
in
hunting
and
is
so
active
that
when
he
is
out
on
the
grounds
with
us
we
merely
catch
glimpses
of
him
as
he
flashes
by
the
other
night
after
the
judicial
reception
when
we
went
to
supper
the
kitchen
cat
suddenly
appeared
parading
down
the
hall
with
great
friendliness
and
was
forthwith
exiled
to
her
proper
home
again
tom
pinch
white
house
february
dearest
kermit
i
quite
agree
with
you
about
tom
pinch
he
is
a
despicable
kind
of
character
just
the
kind
of
character
dickens
liked
because
he
had
himself
a
thick
streak
of
maudlin
sentimentality
of
the
kind
that
as
somebody
phrased
it
made
him
wallow
naked
in
the
pathetic
it
always
interests
me
about
dickens
to
think
how
much
work
he
did
and
how
almost
all
of
it
was
mixed
up
with
every
kind
of
cheap
matter
i
am
very
fond
of
him
there
are
innumerable
characters
that
he
has
created
which
symbolize
vices
virtues
follies
and
the
like
almost
as
well
as
the
characters
in
bunyan
and
therefore
i
think
the
wise
thing
to
do
is
simply
to
skip
the
bosh
and
twaddle
and
vulgarity
and
untruth
and
get
the
benefit
out
of
the
rest
of
course
one
fundamental
difference
between
thackeray
and
dickens
is
that
thackeray
was
a
gentleman
and
dickens
was
not
but
a
man
might
do
some
mighty
good
work
and
not
be
a
gentleman
in
any
sense

kermit
of
course
i
entirely
agree
with
you
about
martin
chuzzlewit
but
the
point
seems
to
me
that
the
preposterous
perversion
of
truth
and
the
and
malice
of
the
book
are
of
consequence
chiefly
as
indicating
dickens
own
character
about
which
i
care
not
a
rap
whereas
the
characters
in
american
shortcomings
and
vices
and
follies
as
typified
are
immortal
and
moreover
can
be
studied
with
great
profit
by
all
of
us
dickens
was
an
selfish
cad
and
boor
who
had
no
understanding
of
what
the
word
gentleman
meant
and
no
appreciation
of
hospitality
or
good
treatment
he
was
utterly
incapable
of
seeing
the
high
purpose
and
the
real
greatness
which
in
spite
of
the
presence
also
of
much
that
was
bad
or
vile
could
have
been
visible
all
around
him
here
in
america
to
any
man
whose
vision
was
both
keen
and
lofty
he
could
not
see
the
qualities
of
the
young
men
growing
up
here
though
it
was
these
qualities
that
enabled
these
men
to
conquer
the
west
and
to
fight
to
a
finish
the
great
civil
war
and
though
they
were
to
produce
leadership
like
that
of
lincoln
lee
and
grant
naturally
he
would
think
there
was
no
gentleman
in
new
york
because
by
no
possibility
could
he
have
recognized
a
gentleman
if
he
had
met
one
naturally
he
would
condemn
all
america
because
he
had
not
the
soul
to
see
what
america
was
really
doing
but
he
was
in
his
element
in
describing
with
bitter
truthfulness
scadder
and
jefferson
brick
and
elijah
pogram
and
hannibal
chollup
and
hominy
and
the
various
other
characters
great
and
small
that
have
always
made
me
enjoy
martin
chuzzlewit
most
of
these
characters
we
still
have
with
us
good
reading
for
pacifists
march
dearest
kermit
you
have
recently
been
writing
me
about
dickens
senator
lodge
gave
me
the
following
quotation
from
a
piece
by
dickens
about
proposals
for
amusing
posterity
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
body
of
gentlemen
possessing
their
full
phrenological
share
of
the
combative
and
antagonistic
organs
could
only
be
induced
to
form
themselves
into
a
society
for
declaiming
about
peace
with
a
very
considerable
against
all
and
if
they
could
only
be
prevailed
upon
to
sum
up
eloquently
the
many
unspeakable
miseries
and
horrors
of
war
and
to
present
them
to
their
own
country
as
a
conclusive
reason
for
its
being
undefended
against
war
and
becoming
a
prey
of
the
first
despot
who
might
choose
to
inflict
those
miseries
and
horrors
why
then
i
really
believe
we
should
have
got
to
the
very
best
joke
we
could
hope
to
have
in
our
whole
complete
for
posterity
and
might
fold
our
arms
and
rest
convinced
that
we
had
done
enough
for
that
discerning
patriarch
amusement
this
ought
to
be
read
before
all
the
tomfool
peace
societies
and
societies
of
the
quentin
as
a
white
house
march
dearest
archie
yesterday
morning
quentin
brought
down
all
his
force
school
baseball
nine
to
practise
on
the
white
house
grounds
it
was
great
fun
to
see
them
and
quentin
made
a
run
it
reminded
me
of
when
you
used
to
come
down
with
the
friend
school
eleven
moreover
i
was
reminded
of
the
occasional
rows
in
the
eleven
by
an
outburst
in
connection
with
the
nine
which
resulted
in
their
putting
off
of
it
a
small
boy
who
quentin
assured
me
was
the
meanest
kid
in
town
i
like
to
see
quentin
practising
baseball
it
gives
me
hopes
that
one
of
my
boys
will
not
take
after
his
father
in
this
respect
and
will
prove
able
to
play
the
national
game
ethel
has
a
delightful
new
dog
a
white
bull
terrier
not
much
more
than
a
puppy
as
yet
she
has
named
it
mike
and
it
seems
very
affectionate
scamp
is
really
an
extraordinary
ratter
and
kills
a
great
many
rats
in
the
white
house
in
the
cellars
and
on
the
lower
floor
and
among
the
machinery
he
is
really
a
very
nice
little
dog
white
house
march
dearest
archie
quentin
is
now
taking
a
great
interest
in
baseball
yesterday
the
force
school
nine
on
which
he
plays
second
base
played
the
p
street
nine
on
the
white
house
grounds
where
quentin
has
marked
out
a
diamond
the
force
school
nine
was
victorious
by
a
score
of
to
i
told
quentin
i
was
afraid
the
p
street
boys
must
have
felt
badly
and
he
answered
oh
i
guess
not
you
see
i
filled
them
up
with
lemonade
afterward
charlie
taft
is
on
his
nine
did
you
hear
of
the
dreadful
time
ethel
had
with
her
new
bull
terrier
mike
she
was
out
riding
with
fitz
lee
who
was
on
roswell
and
mike
was
following
they
suppose
that
fidelity
must
have
accidentally
kicked
mike
the
first
they
knew
the
bulldog
sprang
at
the
little
throat
she
fought
pluckily
rearing
and
plunging
and
shook
him
off
and
then
ethel
galloped
away
as
soon
as
she
halted
mike
overtook
her
and
attacked
fidelity
again
he
seized
her
by
the
shoulder
and
tried
to
seize
her
by
the
throat
and
twice
ethel
had
to
break
away
and
gallop
off
fitz
lee
endeavoring
in
vain
to
catch
the
dog
finally
he
succeeded
just
as
mike
had
got
fidelity
by
the
hock
he
had
to
give
mike
a
tremendous
beating
to
restore
him
to
obedience
but
of
course
mike
will
have
to
be
disposed
of
fidelity
was
bitten
in
several
places
and
it
was
a
wonder
that
ethel
was
able
to
keep
her
seat
because
naturally
the
frightened
little
mare
reared
and
plunged
and
ran
four
sheepish
small
boys
white
house
april
dearest
archie
ethel
has
bought
on
trial
an
bulldog
pup
he
is
very
cunning
very
friendly
and
wriggles
all
over
in
a
frantic
desire
to
be
petted
quentin
really
seems
to
be
getting
on
pretty
well
with
his
baseball
in
each
of
the
last
two
games
he
made
a
base
hit
and
a
run
i
have
just
had
to
give
him
and
three
of
his
associates
a
dressing
down
one
of
the
three
being
charlie
taft
yesterday
afternoon
was
rainy
and
four
of
them
played
five
hours
inside
the
white
house
they
were
very
boisterous
and
were
all
the
time
on
the
verge
of
mischief
and
finally
they
made
and
deliberately
put
them
on
the
portraits
i
did
not
discover
it
until
after
dinner
and
then
pulled
quentin
out
of
bed
and
had
him
take
them
all
off
the
portraits
and
this
morning
required
him
to
bring
in
the
three
other
culprits
before
me
i
explained
to
them
that
they
had
acted
like
boors
that
it
would
have
been
a
disgrace
to
have
behaved
so
in
any
gentleman
house
that
quentin
could
have
no
friend
to
see
him
and
the
other
three
could
not
come
inside
the
white
house
until
i
felt
that
a
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
to
serve
as
punishment
they
were
four
very
sheepish
small
boys
when
i
got
through
with
them
john
burroughs
and
the
flying
squirrels
white
house
may
dearest
archie
mother
and
i
had
great
fun
at
pine
knot
burroughs
whom
i
call
oom
john
was
with
us
and
we
greatly
enjoyed
having
him
but
one
night
he
fell
into
great
disgrace
the
flying
squirrels
that
were
there
last
christmas
had
raised
a
brood
having
built
a
large
nest
inside
of
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep
and
in
which
john
burroughs
slept
of
course
they
held
high
carnival
at
mother
and
i
do
not
mind
them
at
all
and
indeed
rather
like
to
hear
them
scrambling
about
and
then
as
a
sequel
to
a
sudden
frantic
fight
between
two
of
them
hearing
or
seeing
one
little
fellow
come
plump
down
to
the
floor
and
scuttle
off
again
to
the
wall
but
one
night
they
waked
up
john
burroughs
and
he
spent
a
misguided
hour
hunting
for
the
nest
and
when
he
found
it
took
it
down
and
caught
two
of
the
young
squirrels
and
put
them
in
a
basket
the
next
day
under
mother
direction
i
took
them
out
getting
my
fingers
somewhat
bitten
in
the
process
and
loosed
them
in
our
room
where
we
had
previously
put
back
the
nest
i
do
not
think
john
burroughs
profited
by
his
misconduct
because
the
squirrels
were
more
active
than
ever
that
night
both
in
his
room
and
ours
the
disturbance
in
their
family
affairs
having
evidently
made
them
restless
beauty
of
white
house
grounds
white
house
may
dearest
archie
quentin
is
really
doing
pretty
well
with
his
baseball
and
he
is
perfectly
absorbed
in
it
he
now
occasionally
makes
a
base
hit
if
the
opposing
pitcher
is
very
bad
and
his
nine
wins
more
than
of
its
games
the
grounds
are
too
lovely
for
anything
and
spring
is
here
or
rather
early
summer
in
full
force
mother
are
now
as
beautiful
as
possible
and
the
iron
railings
of
the
fences
south
of
them
are
covered
with
clematis
and
roses
in
bloom
the
trees
are
in
full
foliage
and
the
grass
brilliant
green
and
my
friends
the
warblers
are
trooping
to
the
north
in
full
force
quentin
and
a
beehive
white
house
may
dearest
archie
quentin
has
met
with
many
adventures
this
week
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
has
had
a
bad
cough
which
has
tended
to
interrupt
the
variety
of
his
career
he
has
become
greatly
interested
in
bees
and
the
other
day
started
down
to
get
a
beehive
from
somewhere
being
accompanied
by
a
mongrel
looking
small
boy
as
to
whose
name
i
inquired
when
repeated
by
quentin
it
was
obviously
an
italian
name
i
asked
who
he
was
and
quentin
responded
oh
his
father
keeps
a
however
they
got
their
bees
all
right
and
quentin
took
the
hive
up
to
a
school
exhibit
there
some
of
the
bees
got
out
and
were
left
behind
poor
homeless
miserables
as
quentin
remarked
of
them
and
yesterday
they
at
intervals
added
great
zest
to
life
in
the
classroom
the
hive
now
reposes
in
the
garden
and
scamp
surveys
it
for
hours
at
a
time
with
absorbed
interest
after
a
while
he
will
get
to
investigating
it
and
then
he
will
find
out
more
than
he
expects
to
this
afternoon
quentin
was
not
allowed
to
play
ball
because
of
his
cough
so
he
was
keeping
the
score
when
a
foul
tip
caught
him
in
the
eye
it
was
quite
a
bad
blow
but
quentin
was
very
plucky
about
it
and
declined
to
go
in
until
the
game
was
finished
an
hour
or
so
later
by
that
time
his
eye
had
completely
shut
up
and
he
now
has
a
most
magnificent
bandage
around
his
head
over
that
eye
and
feels
much
like
a
baseball
hero
i
came
in
after
dinner
to
take
a
look
at
him
and
to
my
immense
amusement
found
that
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
bed
saying
his
prayers
while
mademoiselle
was
kneeling
down
it
took
me
a
moment
or
two
to
grasp
the
fact
that
good
mademoiselle
wished
to
impress
on
him
that
it
was
not
right
to
say
his
prayers
unless
he
knelt
down
and
as
that
in
this
case
he
could
not
kneel
down
she
would
do
it
in
his
place
quentin
and
turner
to
nicholas
longworth
cincinnati
ohio
oyster
bay
june
quentin
is
really
too
funny
for
anything
he
got
his
legs
fearfully
sunburned
the
other
day
and
they
blistered
became
inflamed
and
mother
had
to
hold
a
clinic
on
him
eyeing
his
blistered
and
scarlet
legs
he
remarked
they
look
like
a
turner
sunset
they
and
then
after
a
pause
i
wo
be
caught
again
this
way
quoth
the
raven
i
was
not
surprised
at
his
quoting
poe
but
i
would
like
to
know
where
the
scamp
picked
up
any
knowledge
of
turner
sunsets
quentin
and
the
pig
white
house
october
dearest
kermit
quentin
performed
a
characteristic
feat
yesterday
he
heard
that
schmidt
the
animal
man
wanted
a
small
pig
and
decided
that
he
would
turn
an
honest
penny
by
supplying
the
want
so
out
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
school
he
called
on
an
elderly
darkey
who
he
had
seen
possessed
little
pigs
bought
one
popped
it
into
a
bag
astutely
dodged
the
school
having
a
distrust
of
how
the
boys
would
feel
toward
his
passage
with
the
pig
and
took
the
car
for
home
by
that
time
the
pig
had
freed
itself
from
the
bag
and
as
he
explained
he
journeyed
in
with
a
small
squealish
pig
under
his
arm
but
as
the
conductor
was
a
friend
of
his
he
was
not
put
off
he
bought
it
for
a
dollar
and
sold
it
to
schmidt
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
and
feels
as
if
he
had
found
a
permanent
line
of
business
schmidt
then
festooned
it
in
red
ribbons
and
sent
it
to
parade
the
streets
i
gather
that
quentin
led
it
around
for
part
of
the
parade
but
he
was
somewhat
vague
on
this
point
evidently
being
a
little
uncertain
as
to
our
approval
of
the
move
a
presidential
fall
white
house
dearest
archie
quentin
is
getting
along
very
well
he
plays
centre
on
his
football
eleven
and
in
a
match
for
juniors
in
tennis
he
got
into
the
what
is
more
important
he
seems
to
be
doing
very
well
with
his
studies
and
to
get
on
well
with
the
boys
and
is
evidently
beginning
to
like
the
school
he
has
shown
himself
very
manly
kermit
is
home
now
and
is
a
perfect
dear
the
other
day
while
taking
a
scramble
walk
over
rock
creek
when
i
came
to
that
of
rock
which
we
get
round
by
holding
on
to
the
little
bit
of
knob
that
we
call
the
button
the
top
of
this
button
came
off
between
my
thumb
and
forefinger
i
had
supposed
that
i
was
putting
much
weight
on
it
but
evidently
i
was
for
i
promptly
lost
my
balance
and
finding
i
was
falling
i
sprang
out
into
the
creek
there
were
big
rocks
in
it
and
the
water
was
rather
shallow
but
i
landed
all
right
and
did
hurt
myself
the
least
bit
in
the
world
more
about
quentin
white
house
dearest
archie
i
handed
your
note
and
the
two
dollar
bill
to
quentin
and
he
was
perfectly
delighted
it
came
in
very
handy
because
poor
quentin
has
been
in
bed
with
his
leg
in
a
plaster
cast
and
the
two
dollars
i
think
went
to
make
up
a
fund
with
which
he
purchased
a
fascinating
little
which
has
been
a
great
source
of
amusement
to
him
he
is
out
visiting
some
friends
although
his
leg
is
still
in
a
cast
he
has
a
great
turn
for
mechanics
white
house
blessed
archie
it
is
fine
to
hear
from
you
and
to
know
you
are
having
a
good
time
quentin
i
am
happy
to
say
is
now
thoroughly
devoted
to
his
school
he
feels
that
he
is
a
real
episcopal
high
school
boy
and
takes
the
keenest
interest
in
everything
yesterday
thanksgiving
day
he
had
various
friends
here
his
leg
was
out
of
plaster
and
there
was
nothing
he
did
not
do
he
he
practised
football
he
had
engineering
work
and
electrical
work
he
went
all
around
the
city
he
romped
all
over
the
white
house
he
went
to
the
and
got
a
pig
for
thanksgiving
dinner
ethel
is
perfectly
devoted
to
ace
who
adores
her
the
other
day
he
was
lost
for
a
little
while
he
had
gone
off
on
a
side
street
and
unfortunately
saw
a
cat
in
a
stable
and
rushed
in
and
killed
it
and
they
had
him
tied
up
there
when
one
of
our
men
found
him
in
a
way
i
know
that
mother
misses
scamp
but
in
another
way
she
does
not
for
now
all
the
squirrels
are
very
tame
and
cunning
and
are
hopping
about
the
lawn
and
down
on
the
paths
all
the
time
so
that
we
see
them
whenever
we
walk
and
they
are
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
us
white
house
dearest
archie
i
have
a
very
strong
presentiment
that
santa
claus
will
not
forget
that
watch
quentin
went
out
shooting
with
rixey
on
monday
and
killed
three
rabbits
which
i
think
was
pretty
good
he
came
back
very
dirty
and
very
triumphant
and
mother
feeling
just
as
triumphant
brought
him
promptly
over
with
his
gun
and
his
three
rabbits
to
see
me
in
the
office
on
most
days
now
he
rides
out
to
school
usually
on
achilles
very
shortly
he
will
begin
to
spend
his
nights
at
the
school
however
he
has
become
sincerely
attached
to
the
school
and
at
the
moment
thinks
he
would
rather
stay
there
than
go
to
groton
but
this
is
a
thought
he
will
get
over
with
mother
active
assistance
he
has
all
kinds
of
friends
including
some
who
are
on
a
hockey
team
with
him
here
in
the
city
the
hockey
team
apparently
plays
hockey
now
and
then
but
only
very
occasionally
and
spends
most
of
the
time
disciplining
its
own
members
tribute
to
kermit
in
after
retiring
from
the
presidency
colonel
roosevelt
went
on
a
hunting
trip
in
africa
writing
as
usual
to
his
children
while
away
on
the
river
darling
ethel
here
we
are
by
a
real
tropical
river
with
game
all
around
and
no
human
being
within
several
days
journey
at
night
the
hyenas
come
round
the
camp
uttering
their
queer
howls
and
once
or
twice
we
have
heard
lions
but
unfortunately
have
never
seen
them
kermit
killed
a
leopard
yesterday
he
has
really
done
so
very
well
it
is
rare
for
a
boy
with
his
refined
tastes
and
his
genuine
appreciation
of
literature
and
of
so
much
else
to
be
also
an
exceptionally
bold
and
hardy
sportsman
he
is
still
altogether
too
reckless
but
by
my
attitude
i
think
i
shall
get
him
out
of
africa
uninjured
and
his
keenness
cool
nerve
horsemanship
hardihood
endurance
and
good
eyesight
make
him
a
really
good
wilderness
hunter
we
have
become
genuinely
attached
to
cunninghame
and
tarleton
and
all
three
naturalists
especially
heller
and
also
to
our
funny
black
attendants
the
porters
always
amuse
us
at
this
moment
about
thirty
of
them
are
bringing
in
the
wood
for
the
camp
fires
which
burn
all
night
and
they
are
all
chanting
in
chorus
the
chant
being
nothing
but
the
words
plenty
of
wood
to
burn
a
merry
christmas
to
you
and
to
archie
and
quentin
how
i
wish
i
were
to
be
with
you
all
no
matter
how
cold
it
might
be
at
sagamore
but
i
suppose
we
shall
be
sweltering
under
mosquito
nets
in
uganda
longing
for
home
campalla
blessedest
here
we
are
the
most
wise
bavian
particularly
nice
and
the
elderly
parent
on
the
last
stage
of
their
journey
i
am
enjoying
it
all
but
i
think
kermit
regards
me
as
a
little
soft
because
i
am
so
eagerly
looking
forward
to
the
end
when
i
shall
see
darling
pretty
mother
my
own
sweetheart
and
the
very
nicest
of
all
nice
daughters
you
blessed
girlie
do
you
remember
when
you
explained
with
some
asperity
that
of
course
you
wished
ted
were
at
home
because
you
did
have
anybody
as
a
really
intimate
companion
whereas
mother
had
old
father
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
have
a
daughter
to
whom
i
can
write
about
all
kinds
of
intimate
things
this
is
a
most
interesting
place
we
crossed
the
great
nyanza
lake
in
a
comfortable
steamer
in
hours
seeing
a
lovely
sunset
across
the
vast
expanse
of
waters
and
the
moonlight
later
was
as
lovely
here
it
is
as
hot
as
one
would
expect
directly
on
the
equator
and
the
brilliant
green
landscape
is
fairly
painted
with
even
more
brilliant
flowers
on
trees
bush
and
vines
while
the
strange
people
are
most
interesting
the
queer
little
king
prime
minister
an
exceedingly
competent
gorgeously
dressed
black
man
reminds
kermit
of
a
rather
civilized
umslopagaar
if
that
is
the
way
you
spell
rider
haggard
zulu
hero
in
this
little
native
town
we
are
driven
round
in
rickshaws
each
with
four
men
pushing
and
pulling
who
utter
a
queer
clanging
note
of
exclamation
in
chorus
every
few
seconds
hour
after
hour
the
last
hunt
gondokoro
dearest
archie
here
much
to
my
pleasure
i
find
your
letter
written
after
the
at
sagamore
no
snow
here
on
two
or
three
days
the
thermometer
at
noon
has
stood
at
degrees
in
the
shade
all
three
naturalists
and
cunninghame
the
guide
have
been
sick
and
so
kermit
and
i
made
our
last
hunt
alone
going
for
eight
days
into
the
lado
we
were
very
successful
getting
among
other
things
three
giant
eland
which
are
great
prizes
we
worked
hard
kermit
of
course
worked
hardest
for
he
is
really
a
walker
and
runner
i
had
to
go
slowly
but
i
kept
at
it
all
day
and
every
day
kermit
has
really
become
not
only
an
excellent
hunter
but
also
a
responsible
and
trustworthy
man
fit
to
lead
he
managed
the
whole
caravan
and
after
hunting
all
day
he
would
sit
up
half
the
night
taking
care
of
the
skins
he
is
also
the
nicest
possible
companion
we
are
both
very
much
attached
to
our
and
tent
boys
and
will
be
sorry
to
part
with
them
quentin
new
york
dear
archie
quentin
turned
up
last
night
he
is
half
an
inch
taller
than
i
am
and
is
in
great
shape
he
is
much
less
fat
than
he
was
and
seems
to
be
turning
out
right
in
every
way
i
was
amused
to
have
him
sit
down
and
play
the
piano
pretty
well
we
miss
you
dreadfully
now
that
christmas
has
come
the
family
went
into
revolt
about
my
slouch
hat
which
quentin
christened
old
mizzoura
and
so
i
have
had
to
buy
another
with
a
less
pronounced
crown
and
brim
we
all
drank
your
good
health
at
dinner
