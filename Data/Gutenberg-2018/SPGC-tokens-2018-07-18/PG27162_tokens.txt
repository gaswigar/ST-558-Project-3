chapter
i
on
the
eolus
it
was
on
one
of
the
cool
brilliant
days
which
early
june
brings
to
the
narragansett
country
that
the
steamer
eolus
pushed
out
from
wickford
pier
on
her
afternoon
trip
to
newport
the
sky
was
of
a
beautiful
translucent
blue
the
sunshine
had
a
silvery
rather
than
a
golden
radiance
a
blew
up
the
western
passage
so
cool
as
to
make
the
passengers
on
the
upper
deck
glad
to
draw
their
wraps
about
them
the
low
line
of
the
mainland
beyond
conanicut
and
down
to
beaver
tail
glittered
with
a
sort
of
radiance
and
seemed
lifted
a
little
above
the
water
candace
arden
heard
the
captain
say
that
he
judged
from
the
look
of
things
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
change
of
weather
before
long
captain
peleg
king
was
a
great
favorite
on
his
line
of
travel
he
had
a
pleasant
shrewd
face
grizzled
hair
a
spare
active
figure
and
he
seemed
to
notice
every
one
of
his
passengers
and
to
take
an
interest
in
them
going
down
to
newport
miss
he
said
to
candace
after
giving
her
one
or
two
quick
looks
the
question
was
superfluous
for
the
eolus
went
nowhere
else
except
to
newport
but
it
was
for
the
captain
thought
that
candace
seemed
lonely
and
ill
at
ease
and
he
wished
to
cheer
her
yes
sir
she
answered
shyly
your
folks
there
for
the
summer
he
went
on
no
sir
i
going
to
stay
with
my
cousin
mrs
gray
courtenay
gray
you
mean
i
guess
well
it
queer
but
i
sort
er
thought
that
you
favored
her
a
little
she
down
early
this
year
i
fetched
her
and
the
family
across
on
my
evening
trip
two
weeks
ago
gray
a
mighty
nice
lady
i
always
pleased
when
she
comes
aboard
would
you
like
to
take
a
seat
in
the
miss
the
wind
blowing
pretty
fresh
candace
was
not
aware
that
this
was
a
distinguishing
attention
which
the
captain
did
not
pay
everybody
and
which
she
owed
partly
to
her
connection
with
gray
and
partly
to
her
solitary
look
which
had
touched
captain
peleg
benevolent
heart
he
had
a
girl
of
his
own
over
to
wickford
who
was
about
the
same
age
and
it
made
him
kind
of
tender
toward
other
girls
who
did
seem
to
have
any
one
to
look
after
them
but
the
wind
fresh
and
it
was
pleasant
to
be
spoken
to
and
noticed
by
some
one
on
this
the
first
long
journey
of
her
short
life
so
she
thankfully
accepted
the
captain
invitation
and
let
him
escort
her
along
the
deck
and
assist
her
to
mount
the
two
steps
which
led
into
the
it
was
rather
a
place
in
which
she
found
herself
three
sides
of
the
little
enclosure
were
lined
with
windows
through
which
the
green
shores
which
seemed
to
be
rapidly
drifting
past
them
could
be
seen
the
fourth
side
was
filled
with
a
long
cushioned
bench
in
the
middle
of
the
glassed
front
was
the
big
brass
wheel
shining
with
polish
and
friction
and
revolving
artistically
in
the
hands
of
its
steersman
who
kept
his
eye
fixed
alternately
on
the
water
and
on
his
compass
there
seemed
to
be
no
regulation
against
speaking
to
this
man
at
the
wheel
or
if
there
were
it
was
not
strictly
regarded
for
two
young
ladies
who
were
already
ensconced
in
one
corner
of
the
long
seat
were
plying
him
with
all
manner
of
questions
they
were
rather
pretty
girls
of
that
hard
modern
type
which
carries
the
air
of
knowing
everything
worth
the
knowing
having
a
right
to
everything
worth
the
having
and
being
fully
determined
to
claim
that
right
to
its
fullest
extent
as
candace
entered
they
favored
her
with
one
rapid
scrutinizing
glance
that
took
in
every
detail
of
her
apparel
from
the
boots
which
were
too
large
for
her
feet
to
the
round
hat
whose
every
bow
bore
witness
to
a
country
milliner
and
after
that
they
noticed
her
no
more
she
for
her
part
only
too
glad
to
be
left
unnoticed
looked
shyly
out
of
the
corners
of
her
eyes
at
them
they
seemed
to
her
inexpressibly
stylish
for
their
suits
though
almost
as
plain
as
her
own
dress
and
jacket
of
blue
alpaca
had
that
perfect
fit
and
finish
which
makes
the
simplest
dress
seem
all
that
can
be
desired
there
was
a
knowing
look
to
each
little
detail
from
the
slender
silver
bangles
which
appeared
beneath
the
loose
wrinkled
wrists
of
their
very
long
gloves
to
the
pins
with
which
their
hats
were
fastened
to
the
tightly
braided
hair
coiled
low
down
on
the
nape
of
the
neck
candace
hair
fell
in
curls
to
her
waist
she
had
always
worn
it
so
and
no
one
had
ever
thought
anything
about
it
but
now
all
in
a
moment
she
felt
that
it
was
wrong
and
improper
been
up
to
new
york
miss
joy
said
the
captain
no
only
as
far
as
the
junction
to
meet
a
friend
replied
the
prettier
of
the
two
girls
why
were
you
on
the
boat
this
morning
captain
i
was
on
the
boat
i

the
night

in
the
when

running

that
let
me
see

brother

married
sister

she

to

friend
but
without
lowering
her
voice
you
ca
think
how
dull
it
been
ethel
no
men
no
dinners
nothing
going
on
as
yet
the
casino
is
only
just
opened
and
people
begun
to
go
there
we
tried
to
get
up
a
tennis
match
but
there
enough
good
players
to
make
it
worth
while
there
absolutely
nothing
courtenay
gray
had
a
girls
lunch
on
tuesday
but
that
is
all
and
that
did
count
for
much
that
georgie
gray
mother
is
it
is
she
there
oh
yes
she
and
gertrude
all
the
grays
they
as
nice
and
delightful
as
can
be
of
course
but
somehow
they
so
literary
and
quiet
and
gray
is
awfully
particular
about
the
girls
she
makes
them
keep
on
with
studying
all
summer
and
she
so
exclusive
she
wo
let
them
visit
half
the
new
people
gracious
why
not
oh
i
do
know
she
says
they
not
good
form
and
all
that
but
i
sure
she
knows
queer
people
enough
herself
there
is
that
tiresome
old
miss
gisborne
down
in
washington
street
the
girls
are
forever
going
there
and
i
seen
them
myself
ever
so
many
times
coming
out
of
the
hares
and
take
boarders
fancy
how
extraordinary
oh
there
are
the
frigates
for
the
eolus
leaving
the
wooded
bank
of
gould
island
behind
and
rounding
a
point
had
now
reached
the
small
curving
bay
to
the
eastward
of
coasters
harbor
where
lay
the
the
new
hampshire
and
the
minnesota
it
was
a
beautiful
sight
the
two
great
at
anchor
with
their
tall
tapering
spars
and
flying
flags
reflected
in
the
water
on
which
they
floated
lines
of
glinting
white
flashed
along
the
decks
for
it
was
and
the
men
clothes
were
drying
in
the
sun
two
or
three
barges
were
disembarking
visitors
at
the
gangway
ladders
and
beyond
them
a
was
waiting
its
turn
to
do
the
same
on
the
pier
a
file
of
boys
were
marching
with
measured
tread
the
sound
of
their
feet
came
across
the
distance
like
the
regular
beat
of
a
machine
a
girl
in
a
was
just
pushing
out
from
the
farther
beach
above
which
rose
a
stone
house
covered
with
vines
that
miss
isherwood
said
one
of
the
young
ladies
she
a
splendid
rower
and
tom
says
she
swims
as
well
as
he
does
the
whole
scene
was
like
enchantment
to
candace
who
had
lived
all
her
life
among
the
hills
of
connecticut
and
had
never
till
that
day
seen
the
ocean
she
was
much
too
shy
to
ask
questions
but
she
sat
like
one
in
a
dream
taking
in
with
eyes
all
the
details
of
the
charming
view
the
shores
broken
by
villas
and
cottages
rising
from
clouds
of
leafy
greenery
the
torpedo
island
with
its
tall
and
floating
banner
over
the
dwelling
of
the
commandant
fort
adams
whose
steep
glacis
seemed
powdered
with
snow
just
then
from
the
multitude
of
daisies
in
bloom
upon
them
the
the
soft
rises
of
hill
and
beyond
the
shimmering
heave
of
the
open
sea
and
yachts
flitted
past
in
the
fair
wind
like
large
moths
filled
with
dipped
their
oars
in
the
wake
of
the
eolus
with
screeching
whistles
were
putting
into
their
docks
among
old
and
warehouses
painted
or
turned
of
a
blackish
gray
by
years
of
exposure
to
weather
behind
rose
newport
with
the
graceful
spire
of
trinity
church
and
the
long
bulk
of
the
ocean
house
surmounting
the
quaint
buildings
on
the
lower
hill
the
boat
was
heading
toward
a
wharf
black
with
carriages
which
were
evidently
drawn
up
to
wait
the
arrival
of
the
eolus
there
gray
team
now
miss
said
the
captain
come
down
for
you
i
reckon
the
two
girls
glanced
at
her
and
then
at
each
other
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
candace
heard
one
of
them
whisper
did
you
ever
and
the
reply
no
but
after
all
we
did
say
anything
very
bad
and
who
would
have
dreamed
that
a
hat
like
that
had
anything
to
do
with
the
grays
she
felt
herself
blush
painfully
the
hat
was
a
new
one
of
brown
straw
trimmed
with
dark
blue
ribbon
she
had
felt
rather
proud
of
it
when
it
came
home
from
the
milliner
the
day
before
and
had
considered
the
little
blue
pompon
with
which
miss
wilson
who
was
authority
in
matters
of
fashion
in
north
tolland
had
enriched
the
middle
bow
as
a
masterpiece
of
decoration
alas
the
apple
of
knowledge
was
at
her
lips
already
she
felt
herself
blush
at
the
comments
of
these
unknown
girls
whose
hats
were
so
different
from
her
own
and
was
thoroughly
uncomfortable
though
she
could
hardly
have
told
why
captain
peleg
politely
carried
her
bag
for
her
across
the
to
where
the
team
a
glossy
coup√©
with
one
horse
was
waiting
he
beckoned
to
the
smart
coachman
who
wore
a
dark
green
overcoat
with
big
metal
buttons
to
draw
nearer
here
your
passenger
he
said
helping
candace
into
the
carriage
miss
i
hope
we
see
you
again
on
the
all
right
driver
oh
thank
you
cried
candace
finding
voice
and
forgetting
shyness
in
her
gratitude
you
been
real
kind
to
me
captain
that
child
got
mighty
pretty
eyes
soliloquized
captain
king
as
he
marched
down
the
wharf
i
wonder
what
relation
she
is
to
the
grays
she
do
seem
their
sort
exactly
she
been
raised
in
the
country
i
expect
but
gray
polish
her
up
if
anybody
can
or
i
mistaken
steady
there
what
you
about
as
a
trunk
came
bounding
and
ricochetting
across
the
gangway
this
wharf
ai
no
meanwhile
the
coup√©
was
slowly
climbing
a
steep
which
led
to
the
avenue
looking
forth
with
observant
eyes
candace
noted
how
the
houses
which
at
first
were
of
the
build
with
hipped
roofs
and
dormer
windows
like
those
to
which
she
was
accustomed
in
the
old
hill
village
that
had
been
her
birthplace
gave
way
to
modernized
old
houses
with
recent
additions
and
then
to
houses
which
were
unmistakably
new
and
exhibited
all
manner
of
queer
peaks
and
pinnacles
and
projections
shingled
painted
in
divers
colors
and
broken
by
windows
of
oddly
tinted
glass
next
the
carriage
passed
a
modern
church
built
of
stone
and
immediately
after
the
equable
roll
of
the
wheels
showed
that
they
were
on
a
smooth
macadamized
road
it
was
in
fact
though
candace
did
not
know
it
the
famous
bellevue
avenue
which
in
summer
is
the
favorite
drive
for
all
fashionable
persons
and
thronged
from
end
to
end
on
every
fair
afternoon
by
all
manner
of
vehicles
from
dainty
to
enormous
there
were
only
a
few
carriages
in
sight
now
though
they
seemed
many
to
our
little
country
maid
shops
were
opening
for
the
season
men
were
busy
in
hanging
eastern
rugs
and
curtains
up
to
view
and
arranging
in
the
windows
beautiful
jars
and
plates
of
porcelain
and
pottery
glittering
wares
from
turkey
and
damascus
carved
furniture
and
inlaid
cabinets
half
a
dozen
florists
exhibited
masses
of
flowers
amid
a
tangle
of
palms
and
beyond
was
the
announcement
of
an
opening
by
a
dressmaker
whose
windows
were
hung
with
more
beautiful
things
than
candace
in
her
small
experience
had
ever
dreamed
of
before
laces
silks
embroideries
the
shops
gave
way
to
houses
each
set
in
a
gay
with
newly
planted
beds
of
flowers
or
foliage
plants
vines
clustered
everywhere
the
trees
not
yet
fully
in
leaf
were
like
a
tossing
spray
of
delicate
fresh
green
a
sense
of
hope
of
expectation
of
something
delightful
which
was
being
prepared
for
seemed
to
be
in
the
air
suddenly
the
coup√©
turned
in
between
a
pair
of
substantial
stone
and
drew
up
before
a
large
square
house
with
piazzas
on
two
sides
and
a
small
but
very
smooth
lawn
whose
closely
cut
grass
looked
like
green
velvet
it
was
dappled
with
and
evergreens
and
hedged
with
a
high
wall
of
shrubs
which
shut
off
the
view
of
the
street
a
continuous
ran
all
round
the
house
close
to
its
walls
planted
full
of
geraniums
heliotrope
nasturtiums
mignonette
and
pansies
every
window
and
balcony
boasted
its
box
of
ferns
or
flowers
and
in
spite
of
the
squareness
of
the
building
and
the
sombre
with
which
it
was
painted
the
general
effect
was
of
cheerfulness
and
shade
broken
by
color
an
effect
which
is
always
pleasant
candace
had
forgotten
herself
in
the
excitement
of
new
sights
and
experiences
but
her
shyness
came
back
with
a
rush
as
the
carriage
stopped
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
very
smart
french
butler
is
gray
at
home
she
asked
timidly
bending
forward
descendez
mademoiselle
vous
pla√Æt
madame
est
occup√©e
pour
le
moment
il
y
a
du
monde
dans
le
salon
then
seeing
the
perplexed
look
in
candace
eyes
he
explained
in
broken
english
mees
is
to
get
out
madame
is
beesy
with
coompany
for
little
while
mees
will
please
go
candace
got
out
the
carriage
drove
away
and
she
followed
the
butler
into
the
hall
he
gave
a
low
call
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
which
brought
down
a
with
a
ruffed
cap
perched
on
the
back
of
her
head
this
way
if
you
please
miss
she
said
and
led
candace
up
the
staircase
which
was
a
wide
one
with
three
square
turns
and
a
broad
landing
lit
with
a
range
of
windows
and
furnished
with
a
low
cushioned
seat
then
came
an
upper
hall
and
she
was
shown
into
a
pretty
corner
room
if
you
please
sit
down
and
rest
yourself
miss
said
the
maid
gray
be
up
as
soon
as
some
company
she
has
is
gone
would
you
like
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
miss
no
thank
you
faltered
candace
and
then
the
maid
went
away
shutting
the
door
behind
her
the
room
which
had
no
bed
in
it
and
was
in
fact
was
so
full
of
curious
things
that
candace
first
thought
was
that
it
would
take
a
week
at
least
to
see
half
that
was
in
it
the
walls
were
thickly
hung
with
photographs
watercolors
charcoal
sketches
miniatures
bits
of
faience
lacquered
trays
and
discs
and
great
shining
circles
of
syrian
and
benares
metalwork
there
were
many
pieces
of
pottery
of
various
sorts
set
here
and
there
on
the
on
on
the
top
of
a
strangely
carved
black
cabinet
with
hinges
and
handles
of
wrought
iron
in
one
corner
stood
an
italian
of
ebony
and
silver
in
another
an
odd
instrument
whose
use
candace
could
not
guess
but
which
was
in
reality
a
tyrolean
zither
an
escritoire
drawn
near
a
window
was
heaped
with
papers
and
with
writing
appliances
of
all
sorts
and
all
elegant
there
were
many
little
tables
covered
with
books
and
baskets
of
crewels
and
silks
and
of
every
description
every
and
little
stand
had
some
quaint
piece
of
or
thrown
over
it
it
was
in
fact
one
of
those
rooms
belonging
distinctly
to
our
modern
life
for
the
adornment
of
which
every
part
of
the
world
is
ransacked
and
their
products
set
forth
in
queer
juxtapositions
to
satisfy
or
to
exhibit
the
varied
tastes
and
pursuits
of
its
occupants
to
candace
it
was
as
wonderful
as
any
museum
and
while
her
eyes
slowly
travelled
from
one
object
to
another
she
forgot
her
strangeness
and
was
happy
tick
tick
tick
tick
went
the
little
french
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
suddenly
it
struck
her
that
it
was
a
long
while
that
she
had
been
left
alone
in
this
room
she
glanced
at
the
clock
it
really
was
almost
an
hour
all
her
latent
homesickness
returned
with
fresh
force
her
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
in
another
moment
she
would
have
been
actually
crying
but
just
then
came
a
quick
step
a
little
rustle
and
she
had
just
time
to
wipe
away
the
drops
when
the
door
opened
and
gray
hurried
into
the
room
my
poor
child
she
exclaimed
have
you
been
alone
all
this
time
it
is
quite
too
bad
i
made
sure
that
i
should
hear
the
carriage
drive
up
and
at
least
run
out
and
give
you
a
welcome
but
somehow
i
did
and
people
came
so
fast
and
thick
that
i
could
get
a
chance
to
glance
at
the
clock
she
kissed
candace
and
looked
at
her
with
a
sort
of
soft
scrutiny
it
was
to
the
full
as
penetrating
as
that
of
the
strange
girls
on
the
steamer
had
been
but
it
did
not
hurt
like
theirs
gray
had
beautiful
big
blue
eyes
with
black
lashes
when
she
smiled
they
seemed
to
brim
with
a
sudden
fascinating
radiance
she
smiled
now
and
reminded
candace
somehow
of
a
great
soft
fully
opened
garden
rose
you
have
something
of
your
mother
looks
cannie
she
said
i
knew
her
best
when
she
was
about
your
age
i
never
saw
much
of
her
after
she
married
your
father
and
went
up
to
live
among
the
hills
she
sighed
softly
there
was
a
short
pause
then
with
a
sudden
change
of
tone
she
continued
and
all
this
time
you
have
never
been
shown
your
room
i
ca
think
why
they
were
so
stupid
who
was
it
put
you
here
cannie
it
was
a
lady
in
a
cap
replied
candace
hesitatingly
a
lady
cap
oh
it
must
have
been
elizabeth
she
my
maid
make
such
a
mistake
again
dear
you
must
learn
to
discriminate
well
come
with
me
now
and
let
me
see
you
comfortably
established
the
girls
are
gone
on
a
to
the
upper
end
of
the
island
it
was
an
old
engagement
made
before
your
aunt
letter
came
or
they
would
not
have
been
absent
when
you
arrived
they
were
very
sor
but
in
the
very
middle
of
the
word
came
frederic
the
butler
with
the
announcement
of
new
visitors
and
just
taking
time
to
lead
candace
down
the
entry
to
a
room
whose
door
stood
wide
open
gray
hurried
away
saying
rapidly
take
off
your
hat
dear
lie
down
for
a
rest
you
better
i
be
up
again
presently
i
wonder
if
everybody
is
always
in
a
hurry
in
newport
candace
thought
she
was
again
alone
but
this
time
she
felt
no
disposition
to
cry
her
trunk
had
been
brought
up
by
somebody
and
stood
already
in
its
place
with
the
straps
unloosened
she
took
off
her
hat
and
jacket
unpacked
a
little
and
peeped
out
of
the
window
to
see
where
she
was
the
room
faced
the
east
and
across
a
corner
of
the
lawn
and
the
she
had
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
which
had
become
intensely
blue
with
the
coming
of
the
later
afternoon
oh
that
is
good
she
said
to
herself
i
shall
see
it
all
summer
she
glanced
about
the
room
with
a
growing
sense
of
proprietorship
which
was
pleasant
it
was
not
a
large
room
but
it
looked
cheerful
with
its
simple
furniture
of
ash
and
a
matted
floor
over
which
lay
a
couple
of
persian
rugs
there
was
a
small
fireplace
bordered
with
blue
tiles
which
matched
the
blue
papering
on
the
walls
and
the
tiles
on
the
washstand
and
the
chintz
of
the
and
lounge
and
the
on
the
mantelpiece
were
blue
also
altogether
it
was
a
pretty
little
chamber
with
which
any
girl
might
be
sufficiently
and
as
candace
noticed
the
tiny
nosegay
of
mignonette
and
which
stood
on
the
bureau
her
heart
lightened
with
the
sense
that
it
had
been
put
there
for
some
one
had
thought
of
her
coming
and
prepared
for
it
she
brushed
out
her
curls
and
washed
her
face
and
hands
but
did
not
change
her
dress
the
blue
alpaca
was
the
newest
she
had
and
she
wished
to
look
her
best
on
that
first
evening
she
sat
down
in
the
window
to
listen
to
the
soft
boom
of
the
surf
which
seemed
to
grow
louder
as
the
night
drew
on
and
did
not
hear
gray
as
she
came
down
the
entry
that
lady
stood
a
moment
in
the
door
surveying
her
young
visitor
what
am
i
to
do
with
her
she
thought
i
want
to
befriend
child
but
i
did
not
quite
realize
till
i
saw
her
just
now
what
a
disadvantage
she
would
be
at
among
all
these
girls
here
with
their
french
clothes
and
their
worse
than
french
ideas
she
not
plain
there
a
good
deal
of
beauty
about
that
shy
little
face
of
hers
and
refinement
too
if
only
she
were
not
so
awkward
if
i
can
once
get
her
into
a
dress
that
fits
and
do
something
with
that
mop
of
curls
she
would
look
well
enough
i
wonder
if
she
will
take
it
kindly
or
flare
up
and
feel
offended
at
every
little
suggestion
that
would
be
terrible
you
are
listening
to
the
surf
dear
i
afraid
it
means
rain
that
sound
generally
is
a
symptom
of
mischief
is
it
said
candace
what
a
pity
a
pity
about
the
rain
no
but
it
such
a
pretty
sound
so
it
is
well
if
you
are
ready
let
us
go
downstairs
i
expect
the
girls
every
moment
ah
there
they
are
now
the
line
of
windows
on
the
staircase
landing
commanded
a
view
of
the
gate
and
approach
and
looking
through
them
candace
saw
a
village
cart
with
two
girls
on
the
front
seat
one
driving
and
a
third
girl
in
the
rumble
behind
approaching
the
house
a
couple
of
young
men
on
horseback
rode
close
beside
the
cart
one
of
them
jumped
from
his
horse
helped
the
young
ladies
out
there
was
a
moment
of
laughter
and
chat
then
touching
their
hats
the
riders
departed
and
the
three
girls
came
into
the
hall
mamma
mammy
where
are
you
dear
sang
out
three
youthful
voices
here
i
am
upstairs
replied
gray
seating
herself
on
the
cushioned
bench
of
the
landing
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
up
there
and
who
that
with
you
it
your
cousin
candace
come
up
and
be
introduced
up
they
came
at
a
run
each
trying
to
be
the
first
to
arrive
candace
had
never
known
many
girls
but
these
were
of
a
different
species
from
any
she
had
seen
before
they
seemed
full
of
spirits
and
conveyed
the
idea
of
being
so
to
speak
bursting
with
happiness
though
i
suppose
not
one
of
the
three
but
would
have
resented
the
imputation
of
being
happier
than
people
in
general
are
or
ought
to
be
georgie
the
eldest
was
short
and
round
and
had
her
mother
blue
eyes
without
her
mother
beauty
gertrude
was
unusually
tall
and
had
a
sort
of
grace
her
light
hair
was
very
thick
and
so
fine
in
quality
that
it
stood
out
like
a
nimbus
round
her
pale
pretty
face
little
marian
the
youngest
two
years
candace
junior
was
not
yet
in
society
but
had
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
picnic
as
a
great
favor
her
hair
had
a
reddish
tint
in
its
chestnut
and
was
braided
in
one
large
plait
down
her
back
she
had
brown
eyes
and
a
capable
little
face
which
was
full
of
expression
they
all
spoke
kindly
to
candace
they
all
kissed
her
but
she
felt
much
less
at
ease
with
them
than
with
their
mother
whose
peculiarly
charming
manner
seemed
to
invite
confidence
from
everybody
after
a
few
questions
and
a
few
words
of
welcome
they
plunged
into
a
description
of
their
picnic
the
the
landing
the
luncheon
the
general
delightfulness
of
everything
berry
joy
was
not
there
remarked
georgie
she
had
gone
up
to
wickford
to
meet
some
one
by
the
way
she
must
have
come
down
on
the
with
you
candace
did
you
see
her
there
were
two
young
ladies
answered
candace
timidly
did
you
hear
their
names
did
you
talk
to
them
asked
gertrude
no
yes
no
i
mean
the
captain
called
one
of
them
miss
joy
i
talk
to
them
but
they
knew
you
why
how
could
you
tell
that
i
heard
them
talking
about
you
what
fun
what
did
they
say
candace
hesitated
her
face
grew
crimson
i
rather
i
do
she
began
then
with
a
great
effort
rallying
her
powers
she
went
on
i
did
like
to
sit
there
and
hear
them
and
not
tell
them
that
i
was
your
cousin
but
i
was
too
too
frightened
to
speak
to
them
so
i
thought
i
would
never
repeat
what
they
said
and
then
it
would
be
any
matter
quite
right
cannie
said
gray
quickly
something
in
the
little
speech
seemed
to
please
her
very
much
chapter
ii
the
first
evening
candace
arden
mother
had
not
only
been
gray
cousin
but
her
particular
friend
as
well
the
two
girls
had
been
brought
up
together
had
shared
their
studies
and
secrets
and
girlish
fun
and
had
scarcely
ever
been
separated
for
a
week
until
suddenly
a
change
came
which
separated
them
for
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
pretty
candace
van
vliet
went
up
to
new
haven
on
her
nineteenth
birthday
to
see
what
a
college
commencement
was
like
and
at
the
reception
afterward
met
henry
arden
the
valedictorian
of
the
graduating
class
a
handsome
fellow
just
years
old
he
came
of
plain
in
the
hill
country
of
connecticut
but
he
was
clever
ambitious
and
his
manners
had
a
natural
charm
to
which
his
four
years
of
college
life
had
added
ease
and
the
rubbing
away
of
any
little
rustic
awkwardness
with
which
he
might
have
begun
candace
thought
him
delightful
he
thought
her
more
than
delightful
in
short
it
was
one
of
the
sudden
with
which
college
commencements
not
infrequently
end
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
they
engaged
themselves
to
each
other
henry
was
to
be
a
minister
and
his
theological
course
must
be
got
through
with
before
they
could
marry
three
years
the
course
should
have
taken
but
he
managed
to
do
it
in
a
little
more
than
two
being
spurred
on
by
his
impatient
desire
for
home
and
wife
and
a
longing
no
less
urgent
to
begin
as
soon
as
possible
to
earn
his
own
bread
and
relieve
his
father
from
the
burden
of
his
support
no
one
knew
better
than
he
with
what
pinching
and
saving
and
it
had
been
made
possible
for
him
to
get
a
college
education
and
become
a
clergyman
what
daily
had
been
endured
for
his
sake
in
that
old
yellow
on
the
north
tolland
hills
he
was
the
only
son
the
only
child
and
his
father
and
mother
were
content
to
bear
anything
so
long
as
it
gave
him
a
chance
to
make
the
most
of
himself
it
is
not
an
uncommon
story
in
this
new
england
of
ours
many
and
many
a
could
tell
a
similar
tale
of
thrift
hard
work
and
parental
love
the
bare
rocky
acres
are
made
to
yield
their
uttermost
the
cows
to
do
their
full
duty
the
scanty
apples
of
the
off
year
are
carefully
harvested
every
pullet
and
hen
is
laid
under
contribution
for
the
great
need
of
the
moment
the
getting
the
boys
through
college
it
is
both
beautiful
and
pitiful
as
all
sacrifices
must
be
but
the
years
of
effort
and
struggle
do
not
always
end
as
in
the
case
of
the
ardens
with
a
disappointment
and
a
grief
so
bitter
as
to
make
the
seem
all
in
vain
for
the
of
those
two
years
proved
too
much
for
henry
health
it
was
not
hard
study
alone
he
stinted
himself
in
food
in
firing
as
well
he
exacted
every
possible
exertion
from
his
mind
and
systematically
neglected
his
body
the
examinations
were
brilliantly
passed
he
was
ordained
he
received
a
call
to
little
upshire
the
village
nearest
to
north
tolland
there
was
a
pretty
wedding
in
the
old
van
vliet
mansion
on
second
avenue
at
which
kate
van
vliet
herself
just
engaged
to
courtenay
gray
acted
as
bridesmaid
and
then
the
cousins
parted
they
only
met
once
again
when
arden
came
down
from
the
country
to
see
her
cousin
married
henry
did
not
come
with
her
he
was
not
very
well
she
explained
and
she
must
hurry
back
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
long
wasting
illness
some
spring
of
vitality
seemed
to
have
been
broken
during
those
two
terrible
years
at
the
theological
seminary
and
though
henry
arden
lived
on
and
even
held
his
parish
for
several
years
he
was
never
fit
for
any
severe
study
or
labor
the
last
three
years
of
his
life
were
spent
in
the
old
at
north
tolland
where
his
aunt
myra
a
spare
sinewy
capable
old
maid
was
keeping
house
for
his
father
arden
had
died
soon
after
her
son
illness
began
her
heart
was
kind
of
broken
the
neighbors
said
and
perhaps
it
was
and
little
candace
and
her
mother
lived
on
with
the
old
people
after
the
long
sorrowful
nursing
was
done
and
another
gray
headstone
had
been
placed
beside
the
rest
in
the
arden
lot
in
the
north
tolland
graveyard
having
carved
upon
it
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
rev
henry
arden
aged
the
lord
gave
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
his
holy
name
there
seemed
nothing
else
for
them
to
do
but
to
live
on
where
they
were
gray
was
in
china
with
her
husband
who
at
that
time
was
the
resident
partner
in
a
firm
of
aunt
van
vliet
had
gone
to
europe
after
her
daughter
marriage
there
was
no
one
to
come
to
the
aid
of
the
drooping
young
widow
and
carry
her
away
from
the
lonely
life
and
the
sad
memories
which
were
slowly
killing
her
for
her
child
sake
she
did
her
best
to
rally
but
her
strength
had
been
severely
taxed
during
her
husband
illness
and
dying
was
easier
than
living
so
she
died
when
candace
was
just
eight
years
old
and
the
little
girl
and
the
two
old
people
were
left
alone
in
the
yellow
a
twelvemonth
later
grandfather
arden
had
a
stroke
of
be
too
much
discouraged
dear
children
this
is
positively
the
last
death
that
i
shall
have
occasion
to
chronicle
in
this
story
but
it
seemed
necessary
to
show
what
sort
of
life
candace
had
lived
in
order
to
explain
the
sort
of
girl
she
after
her
grandfather
died
aunt
myra
aged
and
little
cannie
aged
nine
alone
remained
of
the
once
large
household
and
the
seemed
very
big
and
empty
and
had
strange
echoes
in
all
the
unused
corners
it
was
a
lonely
place
and
a
lonely
life
for
a
child
candace
had
few
enjoyments
and
almost
no
young
companions
she
had
never
been
used
to
either
so
she
did
not
feel
the
want
of
them
as
most
little
girls
would
have
done
aunt
myra
was
kind
enough
and
indeed
fond
of
her
in
a
dry
elderly
way
but
she
could
not
turn
herself
into
a
it
is
not
often
that
a
person
who
is
as
old
as
remembers
how
it
feels
to
play
aunt
myra
approved
of
cannie
especially
because
she
was
such
a
quiet
child
but
i
think
cannie
mother
would
rather
have
had
her
noisier
she
a
nice
girl
as
i
want
to
see
aunt
myra
was
wont
to
tell
her
cronies
she
enough
and
that
better
than
being
too
pretty
and
she
helpful
about
the
house
for
such
a
young
cretur
and
she
not
a
bit
or
i
do
know
how
i
should
have
managed
if
candace
had
turned
out
the
sort
of
girl
some
of
are
like
those
buell
girls
for
instance
always
raising
ned
because
they
ca
get
down
to
hartford
or
bridgeport
to
shop
and
see
the
sights
and
have
a
good
time
as
if
good
times
could
be
had
to
home
as
well
as
anywhere
why
i
reckon
that
miss
buell
has
more
fuss
and
trouble
in
fitting
out
those
girls
every
spring
of
her
life
than
i
had
with
cannie
since
her
mother
died
she
never
makes
one
mite
of
difficulty
or
bothers
with
objections
she
just
puts
on
whatever
i
see
fit
to
get
her
and
she
likes
it
and
there
the
end
this
was
not
quite
as
true
as
aunt
myra
supposed
candace
wore
whatever
it
was
ordained
that
she
should
wear
but
she
did
not
always
like
it
from
her
mother
she
inherited
a
certain
instinct
of
refinement
and
taste
which
only
needed
the
chance
to
show
itself
but
there
was
little
chance
to
exercise
taste
in
the
old
yellow
and
candace
from
training
and
long
habit
was
submissive
so
she
accepted
the
inevitable
and
as
her
said
made
no
difficulty
letters
came
now
and
then
from
cousin
kate
far
away
in
china
and
once
a
little
box
with
a
carved
ivory
fan
as
fine
as
a
dozen
gay
pictures
on
rice
paper
and
a
scarf
of
crape
which
smelt
of
sandalwood
and
was
by
far
the
most
beautiful
thing
that
cannie
had
ever
seen
then
two
years
before
our
story
opens
the
grays
came
back
to
america
to
live
and
a
correspondence
began
between
gray
and
aunt
myra
part
of
which
candace
heard
about
and
part
she
did
not
gray
was
anxious
to
know
her
cousin
child
and
be
of
use
to
her
but
first
one
thing
and
then
another
delayed
their
meeting
the
first
winter
the
grays
spent
at
a
hotel
looking
for
a
house
the
second
they
were
all
in
florida
on
account
of
gray
health
these
difficulties
were
now
settled
a
town
house
had
been
chosen
a
newport
cottage
leased
for
a
term
of
years
and
cannie
was
asked
for
a
long
summer
visit
it
was
gray
secret
desire
that
this
visit
should
lead
to
a
sort
of
adoption
that
cannie
should
stay
on
with
them
as
a
fourth
daughter
and
share
all
her
cousins
advantages
of
education
and
society
but
before
committing
herself
to
such
a
step
she
wished
to
see
what
the
girl
was
like
it
so
much
easier
to
keep
out
of
such
an
arrangement
than
to
get
out
of
it
she
told
her
husband
my
poor
candace
was
an
angel
all
sweetness
and
charm
but
her
child
has
the
blood
of
those
stiff
connecticut
farmers
in
her
she
may
be
like
her
father
people
and
not
in
the
least
like
her
mother
she
may
be
hopelessly
stupid
or
vulgar
or
obstinate
or
we
will
wait
and
see
this
secret
doubt
and
question
was
i
think
the
reason
why
gray
was
so
pleased
at
cannie
little
speech
about
miss
joy
and
her
friend
that
was
the
true
honorable
feeling
she
thought
to
herself
the
child
is
a
lady
by
instinct
it
was
easy
for
her
to
say
it
either
she
a
shy
little
thing
well
if
she
has
the
instinct
the
rest
can
be
added
it
easy
enough
to
polish
a
piece
of
mahogany
but
you
may
rub
all
day
at
a
pine
stick
and
not
make
much
out
of
it
as
these
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
her
mind
she
stole
her
arm
across
candace
shoulders
and
gave
them
a
little
warm
pressure
but
all
she
said
was
dinner
in
twenty
minutes
children
you
would
better
run
up
at
once
and
make
ready
cannie
you
and
i
will
go
to
the
library
you
have
seen
my
husband
yet
the
library
was
a
big
airy
room
with
an
outlook
to
the
sea
there
were
not
many
books
in
it
only
enough
to
fill
a
single
low
range
of
but
the
tables
were
covered
with
freshly
cut
magazines
and
pamphlet
novels
there
was
a
great
file
of
punch
and
other
illustrated
papers
and
that
air
of
which
seems
to
suit
a
house
in
a
little
was
snapping
on
a
pair
of
very
bright
andirons
and
june
though
it
was
its
warmth
was
agreeable
beside
it
in
an
enormous
armchair
sat
gray
an
man
of
the
world
with
a
pair
of
pleasant
kindly
eyes
and
that
shining
bald
spot
on
his
head
which
seems
characteristic
of
the
modern
business
man
court
here
is
our
new
child
said
gray
poor
daughter
you
know
gray
understood
from
his
wife
tone
that
she
was
pleased
with
her
little
visitor
so
far
and
he
greeted
her
in
a
very
friendly
fashion
you
have
your
mother
eyes
he
said
i
recollect
her
perfectly
though
we
only
met
two
or
three
times
and
that
was
seventeen
let
me
see
nearly
eighteen
years
ago
it
must
have
been
her
hair
too
i
should
say
glancing
at
cannie
chestnut
mop
it
was
very
thick
i
remember
and
curled
naturally
aunt
myra
always
says
that
my
hair
is
the
same
color
as
mother
replied
candace
it
is
almost
exactly
the
same
do
you
remember
her
at
all
cannie
asked
gray
just
a
little
i
recollect
things
she
used
to
wear
and
where
she
used
to
sit
and
one
or
two
things
she
said
but
perhaps
i
do
recollect
them
but
think
i
do
because
aunt
myra
told
them
to
me
is
there
no
picture
of
her
only
a
and
it
is
very
good
it
almost
faded
out
you
can
hardly
see
the
face
what
a
pity
le
d√Æner

madame
said
the
voice
of
frederic
at
the
door
we
wo
wait
for
the
girls
they
will
be
down
in
a
moment
said
gray
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
the
sound
of
their
feet
on
the
staircase
was
heard
as
she
spoke
and
down
they
ran
the
elder
two
in
pretty
dresses
of
thin
white
woollen
stuff
which
candace
in
her
unworldliness
thought
fine
enough
for
a
party
people
in
north
tolland
did
not
dine
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
word
they
took
in
supplies
of
food
at
stated
intervals
very
much
as
a
locomotive
stops
for
wood
and
water
when
it
can
not
go
on
any
longer
without
such
replenishment
but
it
was
a
matter
of
business
and
necessity
to
do
so
rather
than
of
pleasure
candace
who
had
sat
down
opposite
aunt
myra
every
day
as
long
as
she
could
remember
at
the
small
pine
table
in
the
kitchen
with
always
the
same
thick
ware
plates
and
cups
the
same
little
black
tray
to
hold
the
the
same
good
substantial
prosaic
fare
served
without
the
least
attempt
at
grace
or
decoration
had
never
dreamed
of
such
a
dinner
as
was
usual
at
the
grays
she
said
not
a
word
to
express
her
astonishment
but
she
glanced
at
the
thick
cluster
of
ferns
which
quivered
in
the
middle
of
the
table
from
an
oval
stand
of
repouss√©
brass
at
the
slender
glasses
of
which
stood
on
either
side
at
the
s√®vres
dishes
of
fruit
sweet
biscuits
and
dried
ginger
and
wondered
if
this
were
to
be
all
the
dinner
did
fashionable
people
never
eat
anything
more
substantial
than
grapes
and
crackers
she
felt
very
hungry
and
yet
it
seemed
coarse
not
to
be
satisfied
when
everything
was
so
pretty
consomm√©
mademoiselle
murmured
frederic
in
her
ear
as
he
placed
before
her
a
plate
full
of
some
clear
liquid
which
smelt
deliciously
and
offered
a
small
dish
of
grated
cheese
for
her
acceptance
oh
thank
you
sir
said
candace
wondering
confusedly
if
cheese
in
soup
was
the
correct
thing
gray
quick
ear
caught
the
sir
she
did
not
even
turn
her
head
but
she
mentally
added
another
to
the
hints
which
must
be
administered
to
candace
as
soon
as
she
was
sufficiently
at
home
to
bear
them
spanish
mackerel
was
the
next
course
candace
inadvertently
took
up
the
steel
knife
placed
beside
her
plate
instead
of
the
silver
one
meant
for
use
with
fish
the
result
was
that
when
the
saddle
of
mutton
was
served
she
had
no
usable
knife
gray
observed
her
difficulty
and
directed
frederic
to
bring
a
steel
knife
for
mademoiselle
which
frederic
did
first
casting
a
scrutinizing
glance
about
as
if
in
search
of
something
and
again
candace
felt
that
she
was
somehow
out
of
the
way
the
climax
of
her
discomfort
came
with
the
pretty
tinted
fruit
plates
and
candace
tumbler
was
empty
and
without
particularly
thinking
about
the
matter
she
took
a
drink
out
of
her
which
she
mistook
for
some
sort
of
lemonade
from
the
bit
of
lemon
which
floated
in
the
water
the
moment
after
she
was
conscious
of
her
blunder
she
saw
georgie
dabbling
her
fingers
in
her
bowl
she
saw
gertrude
with
difficulty
keeping
back
a
smile
which
would
flicker
in
her
eyes
though
her
lips
were
rigidly
grave
little
marian
giggled
outright
and
then
relapsed
into
a
frightened
solemnity
candace
felt
utterly
miserable
she
looked
toward
gray
apprehensively
but
that
lady
only
gave
her
an
encouraging
smile
gray
put
a
bunch
of
grapes
on
her
plate
she
ate
them
without
the
least
idea
of
their
flavor
with
the
last
grape
a
hot
tear
splashed
down
and
the
moment
gray
moved
candace
fled
upstairs
to
her
own
room
where
she
broke
down
into
a
fit
of
homesick
crying
how
she
longed
for
the
old
customary
home
among
the
hills
where
nobody
minded
what
she
did
or
how
she
ate
or
had
any
manners
in
particular
as
she
phrased
it
to
her
own
mind
or
thought
her
ignorant
or
awkward
and
yet
on
sober
second
thought
did
she
really
wish
so
much
to
go
back
was
it
not
better
to
stay
on
where
she
was
and
learn
to
be
graceful
and
and
at
ease
always
like
her
cousin
kate
if
she
could
even
if
she
had
to
undergo
some
mortification
in
the
process
candace
was
not
sure
she
had
stopped
crying
and
was
cooling
her
eyes
with
a
wet
towel
when
she
heard
a
little
tap
at
the
door
it
was
gray
herself
where
are
you
cannie
she
said
looking
about
the
room
with
her
eyes
you
are
so
dark
here
that
i
can
not
see
you
i
here
by
the
washstand
faltered
candace
and
then
to
her
dismay
she
began
to
cry
again
she
tried
to
subdue
it
but
a
little
sob
which
all
her
efforts
could
not
stifle
fell
upon
her
cousin
observant
ear
my
dear
child
you
are
crying
she
exclaimed
and
in
another
minute
candace
she
scarcely
knew
how
was
in
gray
arms
they
were
sitting
on
the
sofa
together
and
she
was
finishing
her
cry
with
her
head
on
the
kindest
of
shoulders
and
an
unexpected
feeling
of
comfort
at
her
heart
anything
so
soft
and
tender
as
cousin
kate
arms
she
had
never
known
before
there
was
a
perfume
of
motherliness
about
them
which
to
a
motherless
girl
was
wholly
irresistible
gertrude
declared
that
mamma
always
stroked
people
trouble
away
with
those
hands
of
hers
and
that
they
looked
just
like
the
hands
of
the
virgin
in
holbein
madonna
as
if
they
could
mother
the
whole
world
now
tell
me
cannie
tell
me
dear
child
said
gray
when
the
shower
was
over
and
the
hard
sobs
had
grown
faint
and
far
between
what
made
you
cry
was
it
because
you
are
tired
and
a
little
homesick
among
us
all
or
were
you
troubled
about
anything
tell
me
cannie
oh
it
only
because
i
so
stupid
and
and
countrified
said
candace
beginning
to
sob
again
i
made
such
horrid
mistakes
at
dinner
and
gertrude
wanted
to
laugh
she
did
laugh
but
i
saw
her
want
to
and
marian
did
laugh
and
i
felt
so
badly
marian
is
such
a
little
girl
that
you
must
forgive
her
this
once
said
gray
though
i
am
rather
ashamed
of
her
myself
i
saw
all
your
as
you
call
them
cannie
even
one
or
two
that
you
see
yourself
they
were
very
little
mistakes
dear
not
worth
crying
about
small
blunders
in
social
etiquette
which
is
a
matter
of
minor
importance
not
failures
in
good
feeling
or
good
manners
which
are
of
real
consequence
they
did
not
make
anybody
uncomfortable
except
yourself
cousin
kate
candace
ventured
to
ask
will
you
tell
me
why
there
is
such
a
thing
as
etiquette
why
must
everybody
eat
and
behave
and
speak
in
the
same
way
and
make
rules
about
it
is
it
any
real
use
that
is
rather
a
large
question
and
leads
back
to
the
beginning
of
things
said
gray
smiling
i
do
suppose
i
quite
understand
it
myself
but
i
think
i
can
make
you
understand
a
part
of
it
i
imagine
when
the
world
was
first
peopled
in
the
strange
faraway
times
of
which
we
know
almost
nothing
except
the
hints
we
get
in
the
bible
that
the
few
people
there
were
did
pretty
much
as
they
liked
noah
and
his
family
in
the
ark
for
instance
probably
never
set
any
tables
or
had
any
regular
meals
but
just
ate
when
they
were
hungry
each
one
by
himself
savage
tribes
do
the
same
to
this
day
they
seize
their
bone
or
their
handful
of
meat
and
gnaw
it
in
a
corner
or
as
they
walk
about
this
was
the
primitive
idea
of
comfort
but
after
a
time
people
found
that
it
was
less
trouble
to
have
the
family
food
made
ready
at
a
certain
time
for
everybody
at
once
and
have
all
come
together
to
eat
it
perhaps
at
first
it
was
served
in
one
great
pot
or
dish
and
each
one
dipped
in
his
hand
or
spoon
the
arabs
still
do
this
then
of
course
the
strongest
and
greediest
got
the
most
of
everything
and
it
may
have
been
some
weak
or
slow
person
who
went
hungry
in
consequence
who
invented
the
idea
of
separate
plates
and
portions
but
that
is
not
etiquette
objected
cannie
people
have
plates
and
set
tables
everywhere
now
in
this
country
i
mean
yes
but
ca
you
imagine
a
time
when
to
have
a
bowl
or
a
saucer
to
yourself
was
considered
finical
and
up
and
when
some
rough
frank
or
gaul
from
the
mountains
looked
on
disapprovingly
and
said
that
the
world
was
coming
to
a
pretty
pass
if
such
daintiness
was
to
be
allowed
a
bowl
to
one
self
was
etiquette
then
all
sorts
of
things
which
to
us
seem
matter
of
course
and
commonplace
began
by
being
novelties
and
subjects
for
discussion
and
wonderment
remember
that
tea
potatoes
carpets
tobacco
matches
almost
all
our
modern
conveniences
were
quite
unknown
even
so
lately
as
four
or
five
hundred
years
ago
as
the
world
grew
richer
people
went
on
growing
more
refined
the
richest
folks
tried
to
make
their
houses
more
beautiful
than
the
houses
of
their
neighbors
they
gave
splendid
feasts
and
hired
sculptors
and
artists
to
invent
decorations
for
their
tables
and
all
kinds
of
little
elegant
usages
sprang
up
which
have
gradually
become
the
custom
of
our
own
day
even
among
people
who
are
not
rich
and
do
not
give
feasts
but
do
they
mean
anything
are
they
of
any
real
use
persisted
cannie
i
confess
that
some
of
them
do
not
seem
to
mean
a
great
deal
still
if
we
look
closely
i
think
we
shall
find
that
almost
every
one
had
its
origin
in
one
of
two
causes
either
it
was
a
help
to
personal
convenience
or
in
some
way
it
made
people
more
agreeable
or
less
disagreeable
to
their
neighbors
we
have
to
study
and
to
guess
a
little
sometimes
to
make
out
just
why
it
has
become
customary
to
do
this
or
that
for
the
original
reason
has
been
forgotten
or
perhaps
does
not
exist
any
longer
while
the
custom
remains
i
wonder
said
cannie
whose
mind
was
still
running
on
her
own
mishaps
why
people
must
cut
fish
with
a
steel
knife
i
read
in
a
book
once
that
it
was
not
genteel
to
do
so
and
i
could
think
why
and
then
i
did
see
the
little
silver
one
i
imagine
that
in
the
first
instance
some
old
discovered
or
fancied
that
a
steel
knife
gave
a
taste
to
fish
which
injured
it
so
people
gave
up
using
knives
and
it
grew
to
be
said
that
it
was
vulgar
and
a
mark
of
ignorance
to
cut
fish
with
them
then
later
it
was
found
not
to
be
quite
comfortable
always
to
tear
your
bit
of
fish
apart
with
a
fork
and
hold
it
down
with
a
piece
of
bread
while
you
did
so
and
the
custom
arose
of
having
a
silver
knife
to
cut
fish
with
it
is
a
convenient
custom
too
for
some
reasons
waiting
on
table
is
quite
an
art
when
there
are
so
many
changes
of
plates
and
a
good
waiter
always
tries
to
simplify
what
he
has
to
do
by
providing
as
much
as
possible
beforehand
you
can
see
that
if
each
person
has
beside
his
plate
a
silver
knife
for
fish
and
a
steel
knife
for
meat
and
two
forks
these
two
courses
will
go
on
more
easily
and
quietly
than
if
the
waiter
has
to
stop
and
bring
a
fresh
knife
and
fork
for
each
person
before
he
helps
to
the
dish
whatever
it
is
but
why
is
there
nothing
on
the
table
but
flowers
and
pretty
little
things
and
why
do
they
put
in
the
bowls
of
water
well
the
lemon
is
supposed
to
take
the
smell
of
dinner
away
from
the
fingers
and
it
is
always
lemon
frederic
is
apt
to
drop
in
a
geranium
leaf
or
a
sprig
of
and
those
are
nicer
as
for
the
other
thing
it
is
more
convenient
for
many
reasons
not
to
have
the
carving
done
on
the
table
but
aside
from
that
i
imagine
that
in
the
first
instance
the
custom
was
a
matter
of
economy
economy
repeated
candace
opening
wide
her
eyes
yes
economy
though
it
seems
droll
to
say
so
in
the
old
days
when
the
meat
came
on
in
a
big
platter
and
the
vegetables
each
in
its
large
covered
dish
people
had
to
put
more
on
table
than
was
really
wanted
for
the
sake
of
not
looking
mean
and
giving
their
neighbors
occasion
for
talk
now
when
everything
is
carved
on
a
and
a
nice
little
portion
carried
to
each
person
you
are
able
to
do
with
exactly
what
is
needed
there
need
not
be
a
great
piece
of
everything
left
over
for
look
sake
one
chicken
is
enough
for
four
or
five
people
if
it
is
skilfully
carved
but
the
chicken
would
look
rather
scanty
on
a
platter
by
itself
do
you
think
so
yes
said
cannie
with
a
little
laugh
she
had
forgotten
her
troubles
in
the
interest
of
the
discussion
a
dish
containing
one
and
a
spoonful
of
peas
for
each
person
would
be
called
a
stingy
dish
in
the
country
where
every
one
sees
his
food
on
the
table
before
him
continued
gray
but
it
is
quite
enough
for
the
single
course
it
is
meant
to
be
at
a
city
dinner
there
is
no
use
in
having
three
or
four
chops
left
over
to
toughen
and
grow
cold
i
see
said
cannie
thoughtfully
what
else
did
i
do
that
was
wrong
cousin
kate
you
called
frederic
replied
her
cousin
with
a
smile
that
was
not
wrong
but
not
customary
servants
are
expected
to
say
and
to
their
employers
as
a
mark
of
respect
and
people
not
servants
use
the
word
less
frequently
than
they
formerly
did
they
keep
such
terms
for
elderly
or
distinguished
persons
to
whom
they
wish
to
show
special
deference
but
aunt
myra
always
me
say
and
to
her
and
grandpapa
she
said
it
was
impolite
not
to
she
was
quite
right
for
she
and
your
grandfather
were
a
great
deal
older
than
yourself
and
it
was
only
respectful
to
address
them
so
but
you
need
not
use
the
phrase
to
everybody
to
whom
you
speak
not
to
you
well
i
would
quite
as
soon
that
in
speaking
to
me
you
said
cousin
kate
as
that
is
what
i
have
taught
my
children
to
do
they
say
mamma
you
call
me
papa
i
like
the
sound
of
it
better
but
it
is
only
a
matter
of
taste
there
is
no
real
right
or
wrong
involved
in
it
candace
sat
for
a
moment
in
silence
revolving
these
new
ideas
in
her
mind
cousin
kate
she
said
timidly
will
you
tell
me
when
i
make
little
mistakes
like
that
about
the
knife
i
like
to
learn
to
do
things
right
if
i
could
and
if
it
would
trouble
you
too
much
dear
cannie
and
gray
kissed
her
i
will
of
course
and
i
am
glad
you
like
to
have
me
your
mother
was
the
sweetest
most
refined
little
lady
that
i
ever
knew
i
loved
her
dearly
and
i
should
love
to
treat
you
as
i
do
my
own
girls
to
whom
i
have
to
give
a
hint
or
a
caution
or
a
little
lecture
almost
every
day
of
their
lives
no
girl
ever
grew
into
a
graceful
woman
without
many
such
small
lessons
from
somebody
if
your
mother
had
lived
all
these
things
would
have
come
naturally
to
you
from
the
mere
fact
of
being
with
her
and
noticing
what
she
did
you
would
have
needed
no
help
from
any
one
else
but
are
you
sure
she
went
on
after
a
little
pause
that
you
end
by
thinking
me
tiresome
or
interfering
or
worrisome
if
i
do
as
i
say
no
indeed
i
wo
cried
candace
to
whom
this
long
talk
had
been
like
the
clearing
up
after
a
i
think
it
would
be
mean
if
i
felt
that
way
when
you
are
so
kind
chapter
iii
a
walk
on
the
cliffs
it
is
always
an
odd
unhomelike
moment
when
one
wakes
up
for
the
first
time
in
a
new
place
sleep
is
a
separation
between
us
and
all
that
has
gone
before
it
it
takes
a
little
while
to
recollect
where
we
are
and
how
we
came
there
and
to
get
used
to
the
strangeness
which
had
partly
worn
away
but
has
come
on
again
while
we
dreamed
and
forgot
all
about
it
candace
experienced
this
when
she
woke
in
the
little
blue
room
the
morning
after
her
arrival
in
newport
she
had
gone
to
bed
by
gray
advice
when
their
long
talk
about
manners
and
customs
was
ended
and
without
going
downstairs
again
you
are
very
tired
i
can
see
said
cousin
kate
a
long
night
sleep
will
freshen
you
and
the
world
will
look
differently
and
a
great
deal
pleasanter
candace
was
glad
to
follow
this
counsel
she
tired
and
she
felt
shy
of
gray
and
the
girls
and
would
rather
put
off
meeting
them
again
she
thought
till
the
morning
ten
hours
of
unbroken
sleep
rested
her
thoroughly
but
she
woke
with
a
feeling
of
puzzled
surprise
at
her
surroundings
and
for
a
few
moments
could
not
gather
up
her
thoughts
or
quite
recollect
where
she
was
then
it
all
came
back
to
her
and
she
was
again
conscious
of
the
uncomfortable
sensations
of
the
night
before
she
lay
a
little
while
thinking
about
it
and
half
wishing
that
she
need
not
get
up
at
all
but
just
burrow
under
the
blanket
and
hide
herself
like
a
mouse
or
rabbit
in
his
downy
hole
till
everybody
had
forgotten
her
blunders
and
till
she
herself
could
forget
them
but
she
said
to
herself
bravely
i
wo
be
foolish
cousin
kate
is
just
lovely
promised
to
help
me
and
i
sure
she
will
i
will
try
not
to
mind
the
others
but
oh
dear
i
wish
i
were
not
so
afraid
of
the
girls
she
jumped
out
of
bed
resolutely
and
began
to
dress
taking
her
time
about
it
and
stealing
many
glances
out
of
the
open
window
for
she
knew
it
must
be
early
and
as
yet
there
were
no
sounds
of
life
about
the
house
after
her
hair
was
curled
she
stood
for
some
time
at
the
door
of
the
closet
debating
what
dress
she
should
put
on
the
choice
was
limited
there
were
only
a
brown
plaided
gingham
a
blue
calico
and
a
thick
white
cambric
to
choose
from
the
latter
seemed
to
her
almost
too
nice
to
be
worn
in
the
morning
it
was
the
first
white
dress
she
had
ever
been
allowed
to
have
and
aunt
myra
had
said
a
good
deal
about
the
difficulty
of
getting
it
done
up
so
it
seemed
to
candace
rather
a
sacred
garment
which
should
be
reserved
for
special
state
occasions
after
hesitating
awhile
she
put
on
the
brown
gingham
it
had
a
little
ruffle
basted
round
the
neck
candace
tried
the
effect
of
a
large
blue
bow
and
then
of
a
muslin
one
very
broad
with
worked
ends
but
neither
pleased
her
exactly
she
recollected
that
georgie
and
gertrude
had
worn
simple
little
ruches
the
night
before
with
no
bows
and
at
last
she
wisely
decided
to
fasten
her
ruffle
with
the
little
bar
of
silver
which
was
her
sole
possession
by
way
of
ornament
for
her
mother
few
trinkets
had
all
been
sold
during
her
father
long
illness
this
pin
had
been
a
present
from
the
buell
who
so
often
furnished
a
text
to
aunt
myra
homilies
she
had
one
day
heard
cannie
say
when
asked
by
one
of
the
buell
daughters
if
she
had
any
jewelry
are
jewelry
i
got
a
buell
had
laughed
at
the
droll
little
speech
and
repeated
it
as
a
good
joke
but
the
next
time
she
went
to
hartford
she
bought
the
silver
pin
for
cannie
who
was
delighted
and
held
it
as
her
choicest
possession
her
dressing
finished
candace
went
softly
downstairs
she
paused
at
the
staircase
window
to
look
out
cousin
kate
storm
had
not
come
after
all
the
day
was
brilliantly
fair
long
fingers
of
sunshine
were
feeling
their
way
through
the
seeking
out
shady
corners
and
giving
caressing
touches
to
all
growing
things
a
book
lay
on
the
it
was
a
york
and
a
lancaster
rose
which
little
marian
had
been
reading
the
night
before
it
looked
interesting
and
seeing
by
a
glance
at
the
tall
clock
in
the
hall
below
that
it
was
but
a
little
after
seven
candace
settled
herself
for
a
long
comfortable
reading
before
breakfast
gray
was
the
first
of
the
family
to
appear
she
swept
rapidly
downstairs
in
her
pretty
morning
wrapper
of
pale
pink
with
a
small
muslin
cap
trimmed
with
ribbons
of
the
same
shade
on
her
glossy
black
hair
and
paused
to
give
cannie
a
rapid
little
kiss
but
she
looked
preoccupied
and
paid
no
further
attention
to
her
beyond
a
kind
word
or
two
till
breakfast
was
over
the
orders
for
the
day
given
half
a
dozen
notes
answered
and
half
a
dozen
persons
seen
on
business
the
girls
seemed
equally
busy
each
had
her
own
special
little
task
to
do
georgie
looked
over
the
and
sorted
tidied
put
away
the
old
newspapers
made
sure
that
there
was
ink
in
the
inkstands
and
pens
and
paper
in
plenty
after
this
was
done
she
set
to
work
to
water
the
plant
boxes
and
stands
in
the
hall
and
on
the
piazza
gertrude
fell
upon
a
large
box
of
freshly
cut
flowers
and
began
to
arrange
them
in
various
bowls
and
vases
little
marian
had
three
cages
of
birds
to
attend
to
which
as
she
was
very
particular
about
their
baths
and
behavior
took
a
long
time
candace
alone
had
nothing
to
do
and
sat
by
feeling
idle
and
left
out
among
the
rest
i
think
i
shall
put
you
in
charge
of
the
piazza
boxes
said
gray
noticing
her
forlorn
look
as
she
came
back
from
her
interview
with
the
fishmonger
see
cannie
the
is
kept
and
the
faucet
of
cold
water
is
just
there
in
the
pantry
would
you
like
to
take
them
as
a
little
bit
of
daily
regular
work
they
must
be
sprinkled
every
morning
and
if
the
earth
is
dry
they
must
be
thoroughly
watered
and
all
the
and
yellow
leaves
and
dead
flowers
must
be
picked
off
do
you
feel
as
if
you
could
do
it
oh
i
should
like
to
said
cannie
brightening
very
well
georgie
has
plenty
to
attend
to
without
them
i
imagine
she
will
be
glad
to
be
helped
georgie
cannie
has
agreed
to
take
the
care
of
all
the
outside
in
future
you
need
have
them
on
your
mind
any
more
that
nice
said
georgie
then
i
will
look
after
the
plants
on
your
balcony
mamma
elizabeth
does
half
see
to
them
oh
might
i
do
those
too
urged
cannie
i
wish
you
would
let
me
well
you
can
if
you
like
they
are
all
watered
for
though
you
need
begin
till
that
is
just
as
well
said
gray
for
now
that
i
am
through
with
the
orders
and
the
tradesmen
i
want
cannie
to
come
up
to
the
for
a
consultation
georgie
you
may
come
too
it
about
your
hair
cannie
those
thick
curls
are
very
pretty
but
they
look
a
trifle
and
i
should
think
must
be
rather
hot
like
a
little
warm
shawl
always
on
your
shoulders
all
summer
long
she
stroked
the
curls
with
her
soft
hand
as
she
spoke
should
you
dislike
to
have
them
knotted
up
cannie
you
are
quite
old
enough
i
think
no
i
should
dislike
it
but
i
do
know
how
to
do
my
hair
in
any
other
way
i
have
always
worn
it
like
this
we
teach
you
cried
georgie
and
gertrude
who
had
joined
them
while
her
mother
was
speaking
let
us
have
a
of
three
in
the
and
see
what
is
most
becoming
to
her
so
upstairs
they
went
and
the
girls
pounced
on
cannie
and
put
a
towel
over
her
shoulders
and
brushed
out
her
curls
and
tried
this
way
and
that
while
gray
sat
by
and
laughed
she
would
not
interfere
though
cannie
at
times
resisted
and
declared
that
they
were
pulling
her
hair
and
hurting
her
dreadfully
for
she
was
anxious
that
the
cousins
should
grow
intimate
and
familiar
with
each
other
in
fact
cannie
shyness
was
quite
shaken
out
of
her
for
the
moment
and
before
the
experiments
were
ended
and
it
was
decided
that
a
little
bang
on
the
forehead
and
what
marian
called
a
curly
knot
behind
suited
her
best
she
felt
almost
at
home
with
georgie
and
gertrude
there
said
georgie
sticking
in
a
last
come
and
see
yourself
and
if
you
do
confess
that
you
are
improved
you
a
very
ungrateful
young
person
and
that
is
all
i
have
to
say
candace
scarcely
knew
her
own
face
when
she
was
led
up
to
the
the
light
rings
of
hair
lay
very
prettily
on
the
forehead
the
curly
knot
showed
the
shape
of
the
small
head
it
all
looked
easy
and
natural
and
as
if
it
was
meant
to
be
so
she
smiled
involuntarily
the
girl
in
the
glass
smiled
back
why
i
look
exactly
like
somebody
else
and
not
a
bit
like
myself
she
cried
what
aunt
myra
say
to
me
i
am
going
out
to
do
some
errands
said
gray
will
you
come
along
cannie
and
have
a
little
drive
gray
errands
seemed
to
be
principally
on
behalf
of
her
young
companion
first
they
stopped
at
seabury
and
after
gray
had
selected
a
pair
of
newport
ties
for
herself
she
ordered
a
similar
pair
for
candace
then
she
said
that
while
cannie
shoe
was
off
she
might
as
well
try
on
some
boots
and
cannie
found
herself
being
fitted
with
a
slender
shapely
pair
of
black
kid
which
were
not
only
prettier
but
more
comfortable
than
the
ones
which
had
made
her
foot
look
so
clumsy
after
that
they
stopped
at
a
carpet
and
curtain
place
where
cannie
was
much
diverted
at
hearing
the
proprietor
recommend
tassels
instead
of
plated
rings
on
certain
holland
shades
for
the
reason
that
a
tossel
had
more
poetry
about
it
somehow
then
after
a
brief
pause
to
order
strawberries
and
fresh
lettuce
the
carriage
was
ordered
to
a
milliner
i
want
to
get
you
a
little
hat
of
some
sort
said
cousin
kate
the
one
you
wore
yesterday
is
rather
old
for
a
girl
of
your
age
i
will
retrim
it
some
day
and
it
will
do
for
picnics
and
sails
but
you
need
more
hats
than
one
in
this
climate
which
is
fatal
to
ribbons
and
feathers
and
takes
the
stiffness
out
of
everything
so
a
big
shady
hat
of
dark
red
straw
with
just
a
scarf
of
the
same
color
twisted
round
the
crown
and
a
knowing
little
wing
in
front
was
chosen
and
then
gray
spied
a
smaller
one
of
fine
yellowish
straw
with
a
wreath
of
daisies
and
having
popped
it
on
head
for
one
moment
liked
the
effect
and
ordered
that
too
two
new
hats
it
seemed
to
cannie
modest
ideas
like
the
wildest
extravagance
and
after
they
returned
to
the
coup√©
she
found
courage
to
say
cousin
kate
please
you
must
buy
me
too
many
things
no
dear
i
wo
i
be
careful
replied
gray
smiling
then
seeing
that
cannie
was
in
earnest
she
added
more
seriously
my
child
i
no
wish
to
make
you
fine
i
do
like
finery
for
young
girls
but
one
needs
a
good
many
things
in
a
place
like
this
and
i
want
to
have
you
properly
dressed
in
a
simple
way
it
was
agreed
upon
between
aunt
myra
and
myself
that
i
should
see
to
your
summer
wardrobe
after
you
got
here
because
newport
is
a
better
than
north
tolland
and
while
we
are
about
it
we
may
as
well
get
pretty
things
as
ugly
ones
it
does
cost
any
more
and
is
no
more
trouble
and
i
am
sure
you
like
them
better
do
you
oh
yes
indeed
replied
cannie
quite
relieved
by
this
explanation
i
like
pretty
things
ever
so
much
only
i
thought
i
was
afraid
she
did
not
know
how
to
finish
her
sentence
illustration
the
old
stone
mill
it
was
a
roofless
circular
tower
supported
on
round
page
you
were
afraid
i
was
ruining
myself
asked
her
cousin
looking
amused
no
cannie
i
wo
do
that
i
promise
you
and
in
return
you
will
please
let
me
just
settle
about
a
few
little
necessary
things
for
you
just
as
i
should
for
georgie
and
gertrude
and
say
no
more
about
it
ah
there
is
the
old
mill
you
will
like
to
see
that
stop
a
moment
john
the
coup√©
stopped
accordingly
by
a
small
open
square
planted
with
grass
and
a
few
trees
and
intersected
with
paths
there
was
a
in
the
centre
a
statue
on
a
pedestal
and
close
by
them
rising
from
the
greensward
appeared
a
small
curious
structure
of
stone
it
was
a
roofless
circular
tower
supported
on
round
arches
which
made
a
series
of
openings
about
its
base
cannie
had
never
heard
of
the
stone
mill
before
and
she
listened
eagerly
while
gray
explained
that
it
had
stood
there
since
the
earliest
days
of
the
colony
that
no
one
knew
exactly
how
old
it
was
who
built
it
or
for
what
purpose
it
was
built
and
that
antiquarians
were
at
variance
upon
these
points
and
had
made
all
sorts
of
guesses
about
its
origin
some
insisted
that
it
was
erected
by
the
norsemen
who
were
the
first
to
discover
the
new
england
shores
long
before
the
days
of
columbus
others
supposed
it
to
be
a
fragment
of
an
ancient
church
others
again
and
gray
supposed
that
these
last
were
probably
nearest
the
truth
insisted
that
it
was
just
what
it
seemed
to
be
a
mill
for
grinding
corn
and
pointed
out
the
fact
that
mills
of
very
much
the
same
shape
still
exist
in
old
country
neighborhoods
in
england
she
also
told
cannie
that
the
mill
used
to
be
thickly
overhung
with
ivies
and
virginia
creepers
and
that
it
had
never
been
so
pretty
and
picturesque
since
the
town
authorities
under
a
mistaken
apprehension
that
the
roots
of
the
vines
were
injuring
the
masonry
had
torn
them
all
away
and
left
the
ruin
bare
and
unornamented
as
she
now
saw
it
did
you
never
read
longfellow
in
armor
she
asked
and
when
cannie
said
no
she
repeated
part
of
the
poem
and
promised
to
find
the
rest
for
cannie
to
read
when
they
got
home
then
they
drove
on
and
cannie
head
was
so
full
of
lief
the
son
of
arnulf
the
fearful
guest
and
the
maiden
whose
heart
under
her
loosened
vest
fluttered
like
doves
in
their
nest
frighted
that
she
could
hardly
bring
herself
back
to
real
life
even
when
cousin
kate
stopped
at
a
famous
in
the
casino
block
and
caused
her
to
be
measured
for
two
dresses
one
was
of
white
woollen
stuff
like
those
which
georgie
and
gertrude
had
worn
the
night
before
the
other
a
darker
one
of
foulard
which
gray
explained
would
be
nice
for
church
and
for
driving
and
for
cool
days
of
which
there
were
always
plenty
in
the
newport
summer
she
also
bought
a
little
brown
parasol
for
cannie
and
a
tightly
fitting
brown
jacket
to
match
the
foulard
and
altogether
it
was
a
most
exciting
and
adventurous
morning
cannie
as
she
took
off
her
hat
at
home
and
fluffed
the
newly
constructed
bang
into
shape
with
gentle
asked
herself
if
it
could
be
really
only
a
day
and
a
half
since
she
said
to
aunt
myra
in
north
tolland
and
if
in
fact
it
were
really
herself
little
candace
arden
to
whom
these
wonderful
things
belonged
or
was
it
some
one
else
perhaps
it
was
all
a
dream
and
she
should
presently
wake
up
if
it
be
i
as
i
believe
it
be
was
the
tenor
of
her
thought
as
of
the
old
woman
in
the
nursery
rhyme
only
cannie
had
no
little
dog
at
hand
to
help
her
to
a
realization
of
her
own
identity
into
candace
bare
little
cradle
in
the
hill
country
had
been
dropped
one
precious
endowment
from
both
her
father
and
her
mother
she
inherited
the
love
of
reading
if
old
tales
were
true
and
the
fairies
really
came
to
stand
round
a
baby
bed
each
with
a
present
in
her
hand
i
think
out
of
all
that
they
could
bestow
i
should
choose
for
any
child
in
whom
i
was
interested
these
two
things
a
quick
sense
of
humor
and
a
love
for
books
there
is
nothing
so
lasting
or
so
satisfying
riches
may
take
wing
beauty
fade
grace
vanish
into
fat
a
sweet
voice
become
harsh
rheumatism
may
cripple
the
fingers
which
played
or
painted
so
deftly
with
each
and
all
of
these
delightful
things
time
may
play
sad
tricks
but
to
life
end
the
power
to
see
the
droll
side
of
events
is
an
unfailing
cheer
and
so
long
as
eyes
and
ears
last
books
furnish
a
world
of
interest
and
escape
whose
doors
stand
always
open
winds
may
blow
and
skies
may
rain
fortune
may
prove
unkind
days
may
be
lonely
and
evenings
dull
but
for
the
true
lover
of
reading
there
is
always
at
hand
this
great
company
of
companions
and
friends
the
wisest
the
gentlest
the
best
never
too
tired
or
too
busy
to
talk
with
him
ready
at
all
moments
to
give
their
thought
their
teaching
to
help
instruct
and
entertain
they
never
disappoint
they
have
no
moods
or
tempers
they
are
always
at
home
in
all
of
which
respects
they
differ
from
the
rest
of
our
acquaintance
if
the
man
who
invented
sleep
is
to
be
blessed
thrice
blessed
be
the
man
who
invented
printing
there
were
not
many
books
in
the
old
yellow
at
north
tolland
but
all
that
there
were
cannie
had
read
over
and
over
again
shakspeare
she
knew
by
heart
and
paradise
lost
and
young
night
thoughts
and
pollock
course
of
time
she
had
dipped
into
her
dead
theological
library
and
managed
to
extract
some
food
for
her
imagination
even
from
such
dry
bones
as
paley
evidences
and
edwards
on
the
will
and
the
affections
any
book
was
better
than
no
book
to
her
aunt
myra
who
discouraged
the
practice
of
reading
for
girls
as
unfitting
them
for
any
sort
of
useful
work
used
to
declare
that
the
very
sight
of
a
book
made
cannie
deaf
and
blind
and
dumb
you
might
as
well
be
laura
and
have
done
with
it
she
would
tell
her
only
i
do
know
where
to
look
for
a
howe
or
a
anybody
who
will
come
along
and
teach
you
to
develop
your
faculties
i
declare
i
believe
you
rather
read
a
dictionary
any
day
than
not
read
at
all
i
do
know
but
i
would
said
cannie
but
she
said
it
to
herself
she
was
rather
afraid
of
aunt
myra
with
this
strong
love
of
reading
the
girl
delight
may
be
imagined
when
gray
true
to
her
promise
put
into
her
hands
a
great
illustrated
volume
of
longfellow
and
left
her
free
to
dip
and
select
and
read
as
long
as
she
chose
she
curled
herself
up
on
the
staircase
bench
and
was
soon
so
deep
in
the
skeleton
in
armor
as
to
be
quite
oblivious
to
all
that
went
on
below
she
did
not
hear
the
bell
ring
she
did
not
see
various
ladies
shown
into
the
or
notice
the
hum
of
conversation
that
followed
she
never
lifted
her
eyes
when
georgie
gray
and
a
friend
who
was
no
other
than
the
identical
miss
joy
of
the
eolus
stood
at
the
staircase
foot
for
some
moments
and
held
a
whispered
conversation
nor
was
she
conscious
of
the
side
glances
which
the
visitor
now
and
then
cast
up
toward
the
brown
gingham
skirt
visible
above
it
was
not
till
to
the
northland
ended
the
poem
that
her
dream
ended
and
she
roused
herself
to
find
the
callers
gone
and
luncheon
on
the
table
gray
was
wont
to
say
that
they
always
had
a
meal
at
noon
and
a
meal
at
night
and
when
her
husband
was
at
home
the
first
was
called
lunch
and
the
second
dinner
and
when
he
was
away
the
first
was
called
dinner
and
the
second
supper
and
that
the
principal
difference
between
them
was
that
at
one
there
was
soup
and
at
the
other
there
was
not
candace
did
not
particularly
care
what
the
meal
was
called
under
any
name
she
was
glad
of
it
for
and
a
morning
drive
had
made
her
very
hungry
and
this
time
she
was
on
her
guard
watched
carefully
what
others
did
and
made
no
serious
blunders
what
are
you
girls
going
to
do
this
afternoon
asked
gray
berry
joy
has
asked
me
to
drive
with
her
replied
georgie
she
wants
to
take
her
friend
over
to
the
fort
to
hear
the
band
play
you
have
no
objection
have
you
mamma
no
none
at
all
and
you
gertrude
i
have
made
any
particular
plan
then
suppose
you
and
candace
take
a
walk
on
the
cliffs
i
have
to
take
marian
to
the
dentist
but
cannie
has
not
seen
the
sea
yet
except
at
a
distance
and
you
both
ought
to
have
a
good
exercise
in
the
fresh
air
for
i
am
almost
sure
it
will
rain
by
you
might
take
her
to
the
beach
gertrude
and
come
home
by
marine
avenue
very
well
mamma
i
will
certainly
said
gertrude
but
there
was
a
lack
of
heartiness
in
her
tone
like
most
very
young
girls
she
had
a
strong
sense
of
the
observant
eyes
of
grundy
and
she
did
not
at
all
approve
of
the
brown
gingham
i
wonder
why
mamma
ca
wait
till
she
has
made
cannie
look
like
other
people
she
was
saying
to
herself
there
was
no
help
for
it
however
none
of
gray
children
ever
thought
of
disputing
her
arrangements
for
a
moment
so
the
two
girls
set
forth
cannie
in
the
despised
gingham
and
gertrude
in
a
closely
fitting
suit
of
blue
serge
with
a
large
hat
of
the
same
blue
which
stood
out
like
a
frame
round
the
delicate
oval
of
her
face
and
set
off
the
feathery
light
hair
to
perfection
their
way
for
a
little
distance
was
down
a
sort
of
country
lane
which
was
the
short
cut
to
the
cliffs
it
ended
in
a
smooth
greensward
at
the
top
of
a
wall
of
broken
rocks
and
standing
on
the
edge
cannie
called
out
oh
with
a
sense
of
sudden
surprise
and
freedom
before
her
was
a
bay
of
the
softest
blue
with
here
and
there
a
line
of
white
surf
where
long
rollers
were
sweeping
in
toward
the
distant
beach
opposite
stretched
a
point
of
land
rising
into
a
low
hill
which
shone
in
the
yellow
afternoon
sun
and
from
its
end
the
unbroken
sea
stretched
away
into
a
lovely
distance
whose
color
was
like
that
of
an
opal
and
which
had
no
boundary
but
a
mysterious
dim
line
of
faintly
tinted
sky
sails
shone
against
the
moving
water
gulls
were
dipping
and
diving
a
flock
of
with
glossy
black
heads
swam
a
little
away
out
from
the
shore
beyond
the
point
which
made
the
other
arm
of
the
little
bay
rose
an
island
ramparted
by
rocks
over
which
the
surf
could
be
seen
to
break
with
an
occasional
toss
of
spray
there
was
a
delicious
smell
of
soft
salty
freshness
and
something
besides
a
kind
of
perfume
which
candace
could
not
understand
or
name
oh
what
is
it
what
can
it
be
she
said
what
the
smell
it
is
like
flowers
oh
there
it
is
again
mamma
makes
believe
that
it
is
the
spice
islands
answered
gertrude
indifferently
or
else
madeira
you
know
there
is
nothing
between
us
and
the
coast
of
africa
except
islands
really
and
truly
how
wonderful
well
i
do
see
how
it
is
so
very
wonderful
it
just
happens
so
i
suppose
there
are
plenty
of
places
where
they
can
say
the
same
thing
perhaps
but
i
never
saw
any
but
this
it
is
all
new
to
me
i
suppose
so
responded
gertrude
with
a
little
yawn
she
looked
to
right
and
to
left
fearing
that
some
acquaintance
might
be
coming
to
see
her
in
company
with
this
rather
shabby
little
companion
would
you
like
to
walk
up
the
cliffs
a
little
way
or
shall
we
go
down
to
the
beach
she
asked
oh
let
us
just
go
as
far
as
that
point
said
candace
indicating
where
to
the
right
past
a
turnstile
a
smooth
gravel
path
wound
its
way
between
the
beautifully
kept
borders
of
grass
the
path
ran
on
the
very
edge
of
the
cliff
and
the
outer
turf
dipped
at
a
steep
incline
to
where
the
sharp
rock
ran
down
perpendicularly
but
to
the
very
verge
it
was
as
fine
and
as
perfectly
cut
as
anywhere
else
candace
wondered
who
held
the
gardeners
and
kept
them
safe
while
they
shaved
the
grass
so
smoothly
in
this
dangerous
spot
but
she
did
not
like
to
ask
indifferent
manner
drove
her
in
upon
herself
and
made
her
shy
a
hundred
feet
and
more
below
them
the
sea
was
washing
into
innumerable
rocky
fissures
with
a
hollow
booming
sound
the
was
broken
into
all
sorts
of
bold
forms
buttresses
and
parapets
and
sharp
inclines
with
here
and
there
a
shallow
cave
or
a
bit
of
shingly
beach
every
moment
the
color
of
the
water
seemed
to
change
and
the
soft
duns
and
purples
of
the
horizon
line
to
grow
more
intense
candace
had
no
eyes
but
for
the
sea
she
scarcely
noticed
the
handsome
houses
on
her
right
hand
each
standing
in
its
wide
lawn
with
shrubberies
and
beds
of
dazzling
flowers
gertrude
on
the
contrary
scarcely
looked
at
the
sea
it
was
an
old
story
to
her
and
she
was
much
more
interested
in
trying
to
make
out
people
she
knew
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
they
passed
or
on
their
piazzas
and
in
speculating
about
the
carriages
which
could
be
seen
moving
on
the
distant
road
how
good
it
is
of
the
people
who
own
the
places
to
let
everybody
go
through
them
exclaimed
candace
when
it
was
explained
to
her
that
the
cliff
walk
was
a
public
one
oh
they
ca
help
themselves
there
is
a
right
of
way
all
round
the
island
and
nobody
would
be
allowed
to
close
it
some
owners
grumble
and
do
like
it
a
bit
but
mamma
says
it
is
one
of
the
best
things
in
newport
and
that
it
would
be
a
great
injury
to
the
place
to
have
it
taken
away
the
cliff
walk
is
very
celebrated
you
know
lots
of
people
have
written
things
about
it
oh
i
should
think
they
would
it
is
the
most
beautiful
place
i
ever
saw
you
have
seen
many
places
have
you
observed
gertrude
rather
impolitely
oh
no
i
never
saw
anything
but
north
tolland
till
i
came
to
newport
then
you
ca
judge
they
had
now
turned
and
were
walking
eastward
toward
the
beach
its
line
of
breaking
surf
could
be
distinctly
seen
now
carriages
and
people
on
horseback
were
driving
or
riding
along
the
sands
and
groups
of
black
dots
were
discernible
which
were
other
people
on
foot
there
is
pulpit
rock
said
gertrude
stopping
where
a
shelving
path
slanted
down
toward
a
great
square
mass
of
stone
which
was
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
water
would
you
like
to
go
down
and
sit
on
top
for
a
little
while
i
am
rather
tired
oh
i
should
like
to
so
much
down
they
scrambled
accordingly
and
in
another
moment
were
on
top
of
the
big
rock
it
was
almost
as
good
as
being
at
sea
for
when
they
turned
their
backs
to
the
shore
nothing
could
be
seen
but
water
and
sails
and
flying
birds
and
nothing
heard
but
the
incessant
plash
and
dash
of
the
waves
below
oh
how
perfectly
splendid
cried
cannie
i
should
think
you
would
come
here
every
day
gertrude
yes
that
what
people
always
say
when
they
first
come
said
the
experienced
gertrude
but
i
assure
you
we
do
come
every
day
and
we
do
want
to
why
sometimes
last
summer
i
did
see
the
cliffs
for
weeks
and
weeks
together
it
nice
enough
now
when
there
are
not
many
people
here
but
after
the
season
begins
and
the
crowd
it
is
nice
at
all
you
see
all
sorts
of
people
that
you
do
know
and
and
well
it
is
pleasant
i
ca
think
what
you
mean
declared
cannie
opening
her
eyes
with
amazement
i
just
as
soon
there
were
twenty
people
on
this
rock
if
i
need
look
at
them
and
they
did
talk
to
me
the
sea
would
be
just
the
same
you
feel
differently
when
you
been
in
newport
awhile
it
not
at
all
the
fashion
to
walk
on
the
cliffs
now
except
on
sunday
and
not
at
this
end
of
them
even
then
a
great
many
people
wo
bathe
either
they
say
it
has
grown
so
common
why
it
used
to
be
the
thing
to
walk
down
here
all
the
nicest
people
did
it
and
now
you
never
see
anybody
below
narragansett
avenue
except
and
butlers
and
people
who
are
boarding
at
the
hotels
and
do
know
any
better
how
funny
it
seems
remarked
candace
half
to
herself
with
her
eyes
on
the
distance
which
was
rapidly
closing
in
with
mist
what
is
funny
oh
i
was
i
was
only
thinking
how
funny
it
is
that
there
should
be
a
fashion
about
coming
down
to
such
a
beautiful
place
as
this
i
do
see
how
it
is
funny
yes
persisted
candace
who
for
all
her
shyness
had
ideas
and
opinions
of
her
own
because
the
cliffs
are
so
old
and
have
always
been
here
and
i
suppose
some
of
the
people
who
make
it
the
fashion
not
to
walk
upon
them
have
only
just
come
to
newport
i
really
think
you
are
the
queerest
girl
i
ever
saw
said
gertrude
a
long
silence
ensued
each
of
the
two
girls
was
thinking
her
own
thoughts
the
thickening
on
the
horizon
meanwhile
was
increasing
thin
films
of
vapor
began
to
blow
across
the
sky
the
wind
stirred
and
grew
chill
the
surf
on
the
beach
broke
with
a
low
roar
which
had
a
menacing
sound
suddenly
a
wall
of
mist
rose
and
rolled
rapidly
inland
blotting
out
all
the
blue
and
the
smile
of
sky
and
sea
gracious
here
the
fog
cried
gertrude
and
i
do
believe
it
going
to
rain
we
must
hurry
home
i
rather
think
mamma
storm
is
coming
after
all
chapter
iv
the
manual
of
perfect
gentility
gray
storm
had
indeed
come
all
the
next
day
it
rained
and
the
day
after
it
rained
harder
and
on
the
third
day
came
a
thick
fog
so
it
was
not
till
the
very
end
of
the
week
that
newport
lay
again
in
clear
sunshine
the
first
of
the
wet
days
cannie
spent
happily
in
the
society
of
miss
evangeline
and
hiawatha
two
new
acquaintances
of
whom
she
felt
that
she
could
scarcely
see
enough
marian
found
her
sitting
absorbed
on
the
staircase
bench
and
after
peeping
over
her
shoulder
at
the
pictures
for
a
while
begged
her
to
read
aloud
it
was
the
first
little
bit
of
familiar
acquaintance
which
any
of
the
younger
members
of
the
gray
family
had
volunteered
and
candace
was
much
pleased
marian
was
not
yet
quite
fourteen
and
was
still
very
much
of
a
child
at
heart
and
in
her
ways
her
capable
little
face
did
not
belie
her
character
she
was
a
born
housekeeper
always
tidying
up
and
putting
away
after
other
people
everything
she
attempted
she
did
exactly
and
well
she
was
never
so
happy
as
when
she
was
allowed
to
go
into
the
kitchen
to
make
molasses
candy
or
try
her
hand
at
cake
and
her
cake
was
almost
always
good
and
her
candy
pulled
to
admiration
she
was
an
affectionate
child
with
a
quick
sense
of
fun
and
a
droll
little
coaxing
manner
which
usually
won
for
her
her
own
way
especially
from
her
father
who
delighted
in
her
and
never
could
resist
marian
saucy
caressing
appeals
it
required
all
gray
firm
judicious
discipline
to
keep
her
from
being
spoiled
georgie
who
was
nearly
nineteen
seemed
younger
in
some
respects
than
gertrude
who
was
but
three
months
older
than
candace
georgie
too
had
a
good
deal
of
the
housekeeper
instinct
but
she
was
rather
dreamy
and
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
was
often
led
into
scrapes
and
difficulties
from
her
lack
of
and
the
easy
temper
which
enabled
any
one
who
was
much
with
her
to
gain
an
influence
over
her
mind
gertrude
but
it
is
less
easy
to
tell
what
gertrude
was
in
fact
it
was
less
important
just
then
to
find
out
what
she
was
than
what
she
was
likely
to
be
gertrude
reminded
one
of
an
unripe
fruit
the
capacities
for
sweetness
and
delightfulness
were
there
within
her
but
all
in
a
crude
undeveloped
state
no
one
could
predict
as
yet
whether
she
would
ripen
and
become
mellow
and
pleasant
with
time
or
remain
always
and
as
some
fruits
do
meanwhile
she
was
the
prettiest
though
not
the
most
popular
of
the
gray
sisters
and
she
ruled
over
georgie
opinions
and
ideas
with
the
power
which
a
stronger
and
more
selfish
character
always
has
over
a
weaker
and
more
pliable
one
marian
was
less
easily
influenced
she
and
gertrude
often
came
into
collision
and
it
was
in
part
the
habit
of
disputing
mandates
which
led
her
to
seek
out
candace
on
that
rainy
afternoon
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
that
morning
gertrude
had
made
some
very
unflattering
remarks
about
their
newly
arrived
relative
it
really
quite
dreadful
to
have
a
girl
like
that
come
to
spend
the
whole
summer
with
one
she
said
to
georgie
she
has
a
bit
of
style
and
her
clothes
are
so
queer
and
and
she
always
lived
up
on
that
horrid
farm
and
has
an
idea
beyond
it
everything
surprises
her
so
and
she
makes
such
a
fuss
over
it
you
should
have
heard
her
yesterday
when
we
were
out
walking
she
said
the
cliffs
had
been
there
always
and
some
of
the
fashionable
people
had
only
just
come
what
she
mean
i
sure
i
do
know
she
says
the
queerest
things
and
she
looks
so
funny
and
so
different
from
the
other
girls
and
of
course
everybody
will
know
that
she
is
our
cousin
mamma
has
ordered
her
some
dresses
from
hollander
observed
georgie
and
that
was
a
real
pretty
hat
that
came
home
last
night
i
do
care
they
wo
look
like
anything
when
she
puts
them
on
gertrude
gray
i
think
it
real
mean
to
talk
so
about
your
own
cousin
cried
marian
who
with
the
instinct
of
a
true
little
pitcher
had
heard
every
word
it
is
cannie
fault
that
she
has
always
lived
on
a
farm
she
did
have
anywhere
else
to
live
very
likely
she
would
have
preferred
paris
with
fine
scorn
or
to
go
to
in
dresden
as
you
and
georgie
did
if
anybody
had
given
her
the
choice
she
real
nice
i
think
and
now
that
her
hair
is
put
up
she
pretty
too
a
great
deal
prettier
than
some
of
the
girls
you
like
i
going
down
now
to
sit
with
her
you
and
georgie
do
treat
her
kindly
a
bit
you
leave
her
all
alone
and
very
likely
homesick
at
this
moment
but
i
shall
be
nice
to
her
whatever
you
do
whereupon
miss
marian
marched
out
of
the
room
with
her
nose
in
the
air
and
devoted
herself
to
candace
for
the
rest
of
that
day
much
to
the
lonely
little
visitor
contentment
they
grew
quite
at
home
with
each
other
over
evangeline
birthday
books
had
just
come
into
fashion
somebody
had
given
marian
one
and
she
now
brought
it
and
asked
candace
to
write
in
it
june
she
said
as
cannie
sought
out
the
right
page
why
that
is
next
saturday
so
it
is
though
i
should
have
remembered
it
if
it
had
been
for
your
book
why
how
funny
cried
marian
opening
her
eyes
wide
do
you
keep
your
birthdays
keep
them
repeated
candace
in
a
tone
of
perplexity
yes
keep
celebrate
them
do
people
ever
give
you
presents
you
ever
have
a
cake
her
voice
increasing
in
dismay
as
candace
in
answer
to
each
question
shook
her
head
cake
on
my
birthday
you
mean
no
i
do
think
i
ever
did
aunt
myra
does
believe
in
cake
she
says
she
liked
it
when
she
was
young
but
since
she
was
converted
to
cracked
wheat
and
oatmeal
at
the
age
of
she
has
hardly
ever
touched
it
we
never
had
any
at
north
tolland
except
gingerbread
sometimes
what
a
dreadful
kind
of
aunt
for
a
girl
to
have
remarked
marian
meditatively
she
sat
for
some
time
longer
on
the
floor
with
her
head
on
candace
knee
but
she
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
about
something
and
said
she
did
feel
like
being
read
to
any
longer
at
last
she
went
away
to
speak
to
mamma
she
said
candace
had
forgotten
all
about
this
birthday
discussion
before
saturday
morning
dawned
dimly
out
of
the
still
persistent
fog
all
the
time
she
was
dressing
her
eyes
were
on
the
golden
legend
which
lay
open
on
the
bureau
beside
her
and
her
thoughts
were
so
much
occupied
with
prince
henry
and
poor
pretty
elsie
for
whom
she
felt
so
very
sorry
that
she
had
none
to
spare
for
the
comparatively
unimportant
fact
that
she
little
candace
arden
had
that
day
turned
the
corner
of
her
seventeenth
year
it
was
all
the
more
a
delightful
surprise
therefore
when
she
went
down
to
breakfast
and
found
a
pile
of
dainty
white
parcels
on
her
plate
a
glass
of
beautiful
roses
beside
it
and
was
met
with
a
special
kiss
from
cousin
kate
and
a
chorus
of
many
happy
returns
from
the
rest
of
the
family
the
little
softnesses
and
prettinesses
of
life
the
gifts
and
surprises
the
sweet
words
the
being
made
much
of
on
special
occasions
were
quite
unknown
to
the
old
in
north
tolland
aunt
myra
was
a
stanch
presbyterian
she
disapproved
on
principle
of
christmas
day
as
belonging
to
popery
and
old
superstition
she
did
see
that
one
day
was
any
better
than
any
other
day
it
was
just
an
accident
on
what
day
of
the
year
you
were
born
and
it
was
no
use
to
make
a
fuss
about
it
she
said
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
the
world
before
you
came
and
there
would
have
been
plenty
if
you
had
never
come
at
all
such
was
aunt
myra
with
these
views
it
may
be
supposed
that
candace
idea
of
an
anniversary
was
not
a
very
lively
one
for
a
moment
she
scarcely
took
in
the
meaning
of
what
she
saw
but
stood
regarding
the
of
parcels
with
a
bewildered
look
on
her
face
it
your
birthday
you
know
exclaimed
little
marian
many
happy
returns
do
you
recollect
that
it
your
birthday
we
should
have
found
it
out
though
if
it
had
been
for
my
book
i
not
so
sure
about
that
said
gray
smiling
at
her
i
had
the
date
of
cannie
birthday
put
down
securely
somewhere
and
i
been
keeping
a
special
gift
for
it
it
something
that
i
brought
you
from
geneva
cannie
but
as
it
had
waited
so
long
before
getting
to
you
i
thought
it
might
as
well
wait
a
little
longer
and
come
on
your
anniversary
oh
thank
you
said
candace
glancing
shyly
at
the
parcels
please
do
begin
to
open
them
urged
marian
it
is
such
fun
to
see
people
open
presents
that
mamma
open
it
first
it
was
a
flat
squarish
bundle
tied
with
a
ribbon
fingers
shook
with
excitement
as
she
undid
the
knot
breakfast
meantime
was
at
a
the
girls
were
peeping
over
her
shoulders
gray
watching
from
behind
his
newspaper
even
frederic
with
a
plate
of
hot
toast
in
his
hand
had
paused
and
out
of
one
discreet
eye
was
observing
her
movements
inside
was
a
flat
case
of
gray
polished
wood
with
a
little
silver
ornament
in
the
middle
it
opened
with
a
snap
cannie
pressed
the
spring
the
lid
flew
up
and
there
on
a
cushion
of
blue
velvet
lay
the
prettiest
little
swiss
watch
imaginable
with
enamelled
on
its
lid
there
was
a
slender
gold
chain
attached
a
little
enamelled
key
nothing
could
be
more
complete
a
watch
for
me
to
be
my
own
cried
candace
hardly
able
to
believe
her
eyes
i
never
thought
i
should
have
a
watch
and
such
a
darling
beauty
as
this
oh
cousin
kate
i
am
glad
it
pleases
you
said
her
cousin
with
another
kiss
you
should
have
had
it
two
years
ago
but
i
thought
you
rather
young
to
be
trusted
with
a
watch
then
so
i
kept
it
till
we
should
meet
oh
do
make
haste
and
open
another
it
such
fun
to
see
you
pleaded
marian
one
by
one
the
other
parcels
were
unfastened
there
was
a
little
ring
of
twisted
gold
from
georgie
a
sachet
of
braided
ribbons
dark
and
light
blue
from
gertrude
a
slender
silver
bangle
from
marian
and
from
gray
a
long
roll
of
tissue
paper
in
which
lay
six
pairs
of
undressed
kid
gloves
in
pretty
shades
of
tan
color
and
pale
yellow
there
was
besides
a
big
box
of
candy
this
gray
declared
was
his
real
present
cousin
kate
was
responsible
for
the
gloves
but
he
knew
very
well
that
there
never
yet
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
who
did
not
have
a
sweet
tooth
ready
for
a
one
bundle
remained
it
was
tied
with
pink
packthread
instead
of
ribbon
cannie
undid
the
string
it
was
a
book
not
new
bound
in
faded
brown
and
the
title
printed
on
the
back
was
the
ladies
manual
of
perfect
gentility
who
on
earth
gave
you
that
demanded
marian
gray
looked
surprised
and
not
very
well
pleased
it
is
a
joke
i
suppose
she
said
georgie
gertrude
which
of
you
has
been
amusing
yourself
in
this
odd
way
not
i
mamma
said
georgie
gertrude
felt
the
reproof
in
her
manner
but
she
tried
to
laugh
the
matter
off
oh
i
put
it
there
just
for
fun
she
said
i
thought
the
more
parcels
the
better
and
i
happened
to
see
that
queer
old
thing
and
thought
it
would
make
cannie
laugh
this
explanation
was
not
quite
sincere
gertrude
had
put
the
book
on
the
table
hoping
to
tease
cannie
she
had
overheard
something
which
her
mother
was
telling
candace
the
day
before
an
explanation
about
some
little
point
of
manners
and
it
had
suggested
the
idea
of
the
old
volume
her
shaft
had
missed
its
mark
somehow
or
like
the
boomerangs
used
by
the
australian
blacks
had
returned
again
to
the
hand
that
aimed
it
for
cannie
did
not
seem
to
mind
at
all
and
gray
though
she
said
no
more
at
the
moment
was
evidently
meditating
a
lecture
it
came
after
breakfast
and
was
unexpectedly
severe
hurting
gertrude
a
great
deal
more
than
her
maliciously
intended
gift
had
hurt
candace
you
are
inclined
to
despise
your
cousin
as
countrified
and
unused
to
society
said
gray
i
grant
that
she
is
not
up
in
all
the
little
social
rules
but
let
me
tell
you
gertrude
that
cannie
has
the
true
instinct
of
ladyhood
in
her
and
after
the
occurrence
of
this
morning
i
am
beginning
to
fear
that
you
have
not
good
manners
are
based
on
good
feeling
cannie
may
be
shy
and
awkward
she
may
not
know
how
to
face
a
room
full
of
strangers
gracefully
such
things
are
not
hard
to
learn
and
she
will
learn
them
in
time
but
of
one
thing
i
am
very
sure
and
that
is
that
if
you
were
her
guest
at
north
tolland
instead
of
her
being
yours
at
newport
she
would
be
quite
incapable
of
any
rudeness
however
slight
or
of
trying
to
make
you
uncomfortable
in
any
way
i
wish
i
could
say
the
same
of
you
gertrude
i
am
disappointed
in
you
my
child
oh
mamma
do
speak
so
cried
gertrude
almost
ready
to
cry
for
she
admired
her
mother
as
well
as
loved
her
and
was
cravingly
desirous
to
win
her
good
opinion
please
do
think
i
meant
to
be
rude
it
really
and
truly
was
a
joke
my
dear
you
meant
a
little
more
by
it
than
that
replied
gray
fixing
her
soft
penetrating
look
on
gertrude
face
you
have
begun
quite
rightly
with
candace
i
have
noticed
it
and
have
been
sorry
sorry
for
you
even
more
than
for
her
she
is
an
affectionate
girl
you
can
make
a
good
friend
of
her
if
you
will
and
you
can
be
of
use
to
her
and
she
to
you
now
what
did
mamma
mean
by
that
thought
gertrude
after
she
had
gone
upstairs
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
what
use
cannie
could
be
to
me
i
might
to
her
perhaps
if
i
wanted
to
the
manual
of
perfect
gentility
was
destined
to
excite
more
attention
than
its
donor
had
intended
in
more
ways
than
one
candace
and
marian
fell
to
reading
it
and
found
its
contents
so
amusing
that
they
carried
it
to
the
where
georgie
was
taking
a
lesson
in
from
her
mother
who
was
very
clever
at
all
the
minor
art
accomplishments
gertrude
came
in
at
the
same
time
in
search
of
some
crewels
to
match
an
embroidery
pattern
so
they
were
all
together
mamma
mamma
please
listen
to
this
cried
marian
and
she
read
for
entering
the
room
at
an
evening
fix
your
eye
on
the
lady
of
the
house
on
entering
and
advance
toward
her
with
outstretched
hand
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
until
you
have
interchanged
the
ordinary
salutations
of
the
occasion
when
this
is
done
turn
aside
and
mingle
with
the
other
guests
now
mamma
just
imagine
it
marching
in
with
your
hand
out
and
your
eye
fixed
and
marian
relinquishing
the
manual
to
cannie
flew
to
the
door
and
entered
in
the
manner
prescribed
with
her
eyes
set
in
a
stony
glare
on
her
mother
face
and
her
hand
held
before
her
as
stiffly
as
if
it
had
been
a
shingle
no
one
could
help
laughing
i
do
think
the
hand
and
the
glare
are
necessary
said
gray
but
it
is
certainly
quite
proper
to
speak
to
the
lady
of
the
house
when
you
come
in
before
you
begin
to
talk
to
other
people
here
another
cried
marian
hardly
waiting
till
her
mother
had
done
speaking
just
listen
to
these
for
a
horseback
ride
the
lady
should
stand
on
the
left
side
of
the
horse
with
her
right
hand
on
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
and
rest
her
left
foot
lightly
on
the
shoulder
of
her
gentleman
attendant
who
bends
before
her
when
this
is
done
the
gentleman
will
slowly
raise
himself
to
the
perpendicular
position
and
in
doing
so
lift
the
lady
without
difficulty
to
the
level
of
her
seat
my
gracious
suppose
he
did
remarked
georgie
looking
up
from
her
painting
there
she
would
be
standing
on
his
shoulder
on
one
foot
imagine
it
on
the
avenue
and
the
four
girls
united
in
a
peal
of
laughter
but
there
is
something
here
that
i
really
want
to
know
about
said
candace
may
i
read
it
to
you
cousin
kate
it
in
a
chapter
called
oh
my
cried
marian
who
still
held
fast
to
one
side
of
the
manual
it
tells
how
to
refuse
gentlemen
when
they
offer
themselves
to
you
here
it
all
is
you
must
say
i
regret
extremely
if
anything
in
my
manner
has
led
to
a
misapprehension
of
my
true
feelings
i
do
not
experience
for
you
the
affection
which
alone
can
make
the
marriage
relation
a
happy
one
so
i
no
no
interrupted
candace
blushing
very
pink
and
pulling
the
book
away
from
marian
that
is
at
all
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
cousin
kate
it
was
oh
then
perhaps
you
meant
to
accept
him
went
on
the
incorrigible
marian
again
getting
possession
of
one
side
of
the
manual
of
gentility
here
you
are
friend
your
letter
has
made
me
truly
happy
breathing
as
it
does
expressions
of
deep
and
heartfelt
affection
of
which
i
have
long
felt
the
corresponding
sentiments
i
shall
be
happy
to
receive
you
in
my
home
as
an
accepted
suitor
and
i
cousin
kate
make
her
stop
is
she
too
bad
said
cannie
vainly
struggling
for
the
possession
of
the
book
i
let
me
see
where
was
i
when
you
interrupted
went
on
marian
oh
yes
here
i
am
sure
that
my
parents
will
give
their
hearty
consent
to
our
union
receive
my
thanks
for
your
assurances
and
believe
but
candace
had
again
got
hold
of
the
volume
and
no
one
ever
learned
the
end
of
the
letter
or
what
the
lover
of
this
obliging
lady
was
to
believe
is
what
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
cousin
kate
said
candace
when
quiet
was
restored
the
book
says
signature
of
a
letter
should
depend
upon
the
degree
of
familiarity
existing
between
the
writer
and
the
person
addressed
for
instance
in
writing
to
a
perfect
stranger
a
lady
would
naturally
use
the
form
yours
truly
m
cotterell
oh
oh
interrupted
georgie
fancy
any
one
signing
herself
truly
m
cotterell
it
awfully
vulgar
is
it
mamma
that
is
a
very
book
observed
gray
still
i
think
even
at
the
time
when
it
was
published
that
people
used
a
signature
like
that
it
may
not
be
vulgar
but
it
certainly
is
not
correct
nothing
but
the
christian
name
should
ever
be
used
as
a
signature
but
suppose
the
person
you
were
writing
to
did
not
know
whether
you
were
married
or
not
said
candace
then
you
can
add
your
address
below
like
this
and
she
wrote
on
the
edge
of
her
yours
truly
catherine
gray
courtenay
gray
newport
i
that
is
what
i
should
do
if
i
were
writing
to
a
stranger
then
there
is
this
about
the
addresses
of
letters
went
on
candace
addressing
a
married
lady
use
her
maiden
as
well
as
her
married
name
for
example
in
writing
to
miss
sarah
beebe
who
is
married
to
george
gordon
the
proper
direction
would
be
sarah
gordon
care
of
george
gordon
oshkosh
michigan
is
that
right
cousin
kate
no
that
is
decidedly
when
miss
beebe
married
she
became
not
only
gordon
but
george
gordon
to
distinguish
her
from
any
other
gordons
who
might
happen
to
exist
she
should
herself
gordon
but
her
letters
and
cards
should
bear
her
married
name
george
gordon
but
people
do
write
to
widows
in
that
way
do
they
asked
gertrude
i
recollect
when
i
went
to
the
with
berry
joy
one
day
there
was
a
letter
for
her
mother
directed
to
louisa
bailey
joy
yes
people
do
but
not
the
people
who
know
the
right
way
her
mother
replied
dryly
a
man
christian
name
does
die
with
him
any
more
than
his
surname
i
often
see
letters
addressed
to
jane
this
and
maria
that
but
it
never
seems
to
me
either
correct
or
elegant
it
is
a
purely
american
custom
english
people
have
never
adopted
it
and
it
seems
very
odd
to
them
well
about
cards
continued
marian
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
manual
of
gentility
see
what
a
funny
little
card
this
is
and
the
writer
of
the
book
says
it
is
the
kind
we
ought
to
have
she
pointed
to
a
page
on
which
appeared
a
little
oblong
enclosure
bearing
the
name
that
is
nice
a
bit
is
it
mamma
no
i
confess
that
it
does
not
look
to
me
at
all
right
girls
old
enough
to
need
cards
are
old
enough
to
have
to
their
names
if
i
were
that
young
woman
i
should
spell
without
the
and
call
myself
frances
jones
on
my
card
and
keep
my
pet
name
for
the
use
of
my
friends
and
not
print
it
i
think
i
learned
a
good
deal
said
candace
the
funny
old
book
is
right
in
what
it
says
but
cousin
kate
knows
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
i
glad
you
gave
it
to
me
gertrude
gertrude
had
the
grace
to
feel
ashamed
as
she
saw
candace
perfect
freedom
from
shame
oh
dear
how
much
there
is
to
learn
continued
candace
with
a
sigh
she
was
still
deep
in
the
ladies
manual
of
perfect
gentility
put
away
that
book
cannie
said
her
cousin
or
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
hide
it
where
gertrude
shall
not
find
it
again
good
breeding
can
be
learned
without
printed
rules
can
it
mamma
yes
for
as
i
was
saying
this
morning
to
gertrude
good
manners
are
the
result
of
good
feeling
if
we
really
care
about
other
people
and
want
to
make
them
happy
and
think
of
them
and
not
of
ourselves
we
shall
instinctively
do
what
will
seem
pleasant
to
them
and
avoid
doing
what
is
disagreeable
we
shall
refrain
from
interrupting
them
when
they
are
speaking
we
shall
not
half
listen
to
what
they
say
while
our
eyes
are
roving
about
the
room
and
our
attention
wandering
to
other
things
we
shall
be
quick
to
notice
if
they
want
anything
that
we
can
get
for
them
we
shall
not
answer
at
random
or
giggle
or
say
the
wrong
thing
we
shall
not
loll
back
in
our
chairs
as
georgie
is
doing
at
this
moment
with
one
foot
cocked
over
the
other
knee
and
a
in
our
mouths
mamma
and
georgie
hastily
recovered
the
upright
position
and
took
her
from
between
her
lips
we
shall
not
drum
idly
on
as
gertrude
was
doing
just
now
for
fear
that
the
little
noise
will
be
disagreeable
to
our
neighbors
now
mamma
we
shall
not
walk
carelessly
between
any
one
and
the
fire
because
we
shall
be
afraid
of
making
them
cold
nor
shall
we
upset
a
while
doing
so
as
marian
upset
mine
just
now
mamma
i
do
believe
you
are
giving
us
all
a
scolding
i
shall
just
stop
you
and
marian
flung
her
arms
round
her
mother
neck
and
gave
her
half
a
dozen
enormous
kisses
we
shall
consider
a
kiss
as
a
favor
went
on
gray
inexorably
holding
marian
off
at
arm
length
not
a
punishment
to
be
inflicted
whenever
we
happen
to
feel
like
it
we
shall
never
trot
one
foot
when
we
are
nervous
and
shake
the
table
cannie
that
you
i
thought
it
would
be
your
turn
soon
said
marian
oh
did
i
trot
said
cannie
please
excuse
me
cousin
kate
i
have
such
a
bad
habit
of
doing
that
aunt
myra
says
it
my
if
it
a
it
all
very
well
replied
her
cousin
i
did
know
in
short
my
dears
as
the
poet
says
are
not
idle
but
the
fruit
of
noble
nature
and
of
lofty
mind
the
instinct
of
of
gentleness
of
consideration
and
forethought
and
quick
sympathy
which
go
to
make
up
what
we
call
good
breeding
the
absence
of
noise
and
hurry
the
thousand
and
one
little
ways
by
which
we
can
please
people
or
avoid
displeasing
them
are
all
taught
us
by
our
own
hearts
good
manners
are
the
fine
flower
of
civilization
and
everybody
can
have
them
i
always
say
that
one
of
the
men
of
my
acquaintance
is
jarvis
the
mason
i
have
known
him
come
up
out
of
a
cistern
to
speak
to
me
dressed
in
overalls
and
a
flannel
shirt
and
his
bow
and
his
manner
and
the
politeness
of
his
address
would
have
done
credit
to
any
gentleman
in
the
world
mamma
how
funny
you
are
said
georgie
wonderingly
but
gertrude
caught
her
mother
meaning
more
clearly
i
rather
like
it
she
said
slowly
it
sounds
like
something
in
a
poem
or
a
storybook
and
it
would
be
nice
if
everybody
felt
like
that
but
people
do
i
heard
joy
speak
quite
rudely
to
jarvis
mamma
very
likely
i
never
have
considered
joy
as
a
model
of
manners
replied
gray
coolly
and
that
reminds
me
to
say
just
one
other
word
about
good
breeding
toward
servants
and
people
who
work
for
us
or
are
poor
and
need
our
help
gentleness
and
politeness
are
even
more
important
with
them
than
they
are
with
other
people
why
more
mamma
because
their
lives
are
harder
than
ours
and
we
owe
them
all
the
little
help
that
courtesy
can
give
because
too
we
are
their
models
consciously
or
unconsciously
and
if
we
are
polite
to
them
they
will
in
return
be
polite
to
us
and
besides
they
meet
us
at
a
disadvantage
if
a
servant
back
she
is
called
impertinent
and
discharged
but
i
should
think
it
must
be
rather
hard
to
answer
back
to
some
mistresses
is
that
why
you
are
always
so
very
polite

charming
afternoon
chapter
down
to
beaver
tail
sunday
morning
brought
the
fresh
lovely
stillness
which
sundays
in
early
summer
seem
always
to
possess
in
newport
later
in
the
season
the
roll
of
wheels
and
the
jingle
of
plated
harnesses
come
to
mar
this
peacefulness
but
till
the
very
end
of
june
it
endures
and
is
one
of
the
sweet
things
of
the
place
the
joys
were
at
breakfast
it
was
one
of
the
points
in
which
joy
took
most
pride
that
this
meal
was
served
in
a
special
apartment
known
as
the
and
not
as
with
most
families
in
the
room
where
they
dined
the
was
not
large
but
sumptuous
in
all
its
appointments
a
critical
taste
might
have
objected
that
the
plush
curtains
which
shaded
the
windows
were
too
heavy
for
summer
that
the
begilded
wallpaper
swore
a
little
at
its
own
dado
and
frieze
as
well
as
deadened
the
effect
of
the
pictures
which
hung
against
it
and
that
the
drapery
of
lace
and
velvet
which
veiled
the
fireplace
made
a
fire
inconvenient
and
almost
impossible
however
cold
the
weather
might
be
but
a
critical
taste
might
have
found
the
same
faults
with
the
whole
house
the
general
effect
was
of
costliness
and
magnificence
but
the
details
were
at
variance
and
comfort
and
homelikeness
had
been
sacrificed
in
the
effort
to
make
everything
fine
there
was
a
library
with
almost
no
books
in
it
a
which
was
used
only
for
balls
and
looked
bare
and
shut
up
on
ordinary
days
a
huge
full
of
costly
toys
tables
loaded
with
s√®vres
cups
other
tables
with
processions
of
in
precious
china
crowded
with
porcelain
figures
and
bits
of
old
dresden
ware
there
was
a
great
deal
of
carving
and
but
it
all
had
the
air
of
being
created
and
kept
for
company
use
and
deserted
the
moment
company
went
away
joy
had
only
got
so
far
in
her
art
education
as
this
that
she
bought
everything
which
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
which
her
neighbors
bought
and
she
never
stopped
to
reason
about
such
minor
points
as
taste
fitness
convenience
or
the
adaptation
of
an
article
to
her
own
particular
needs
joy
was
the
very
image
of
a
prosperous
woman
as
she
sat
behind
her
heavy
silver
and
reading
the
sunday
paper
to
get
which
her
groom
had
ridden
a
couple
of
miles
before
breakfast
her
very
black
hair
was
trained
into
a
line
of
formal
rings
across
her
forehead
which
as
yet
scarcely
showed
a
wrinkle
her
tightly
laced
figure
was
almost
as
slender
as
her
daughter
and
the
hand
sparkling
with
diamonds
which
held
the
paper
was
white
and
youthful
handsome
she
certainly
was
and
people
called
her
agreeable
for
she
talked
a
great
deal
in
a
noisy
lively
way
and
had
a
caressing
manner
for
all
persons
whom
she
thought
it
worth
her
while
to
caress
but
her
face
was
hard
and
when
the
society
smile
died
out
of
it
it
was
neither
intelligent
nor
kindly
joy
had
been
extremely
pretty
in
her
youth
berenice
was
like
her
but
tom
joy
the
son
resembled
his
father
who
had
died
three
or
four
years
before
the
opening
of
this
little
story
berry
and
her
friend
ethel
curtis
were
talking
about
a
sailing
party
which
they
had
planned
for
the
next
day
the
grays
and
the
halletts
and
julia
prime
that
makes
seven
mamma
for
matron
eight
then
there
tom
and
george
rivington
and
the
two
fosters
i
ca
think
where
we
are
to
get
the
other
three
men
it
is
like
a
dinner
party
the
numbers
need
not
be
exactly
equal
suggested
ethel
that
true
but
it
a
great
deal
better
fun
to
have
them
equal
men
hate
to
talk
to
two
girls
at
once
and
the
girls
who
have
any
men
to
talk
to
feel
left
out
carrol
benton
is
coming
up
the
end
of
the
week
i
wish
he
were
here
now
i
guess
you
better
look
up
some
other
matron
and
let
me
off
said
joy
laying
down
her
newspaper
i
do
care
much
for
sailing
so
apt
to
feel
a
little
sick
and
that
spoils
all
the
pleasure
of
it
ask
freddy
allen
she
is
young
and
likes
to
go
everywhere
and
freddy
will
go
along
and
make
another
gentleman
that
will
do
nicely
if
you
really
do
want
to
go
mamma
we
invite
them
all
as
we
come
out
of
church
and
save
the
bother
of
writing
notes
it
easier
to
explain
when
you
see
people
than
to
write
down
everything
yes
that
one
of
the
conveniences
of
going
to
church
remarked
joy
calmly
i
often
had
as
many
as
three
or
four
invitations
coming
out
of
trinity
on
a
sunday
morning
in
the
season
these
muffins
are
horrid
james
tell
the
cook
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
herself
to
send
up
such
things
they
as
tough
as
leather
and
burned
besides
as
black
as
my
shoe
i
do
declare
yes
and
james
departed
to
incense
the
cook
with
the
unsoftened
message
the
cook
declared
that
when
ladies
came
down
an
hour
late
for
breakfast
they
must
expect
tough
muffins
and
for
her
part
she
did
care
whether
they
were
good
or
not
she
did
think
much
of
the
place
anyway
and
did
mean
to
stay
on
there
be
plenty
of
people
coming
in
a
week
or
two
and
plenty
of
places
to
pick
and
choose
from
joy
was
always
having
little
difficulties
with
her
servants
trinity
church
looked
cool
and
shady
as
the
party
entered
it
from
the
dazzle
of
the
outer
sunshine
berenice
joy
was
perfectly
in
the
outward
forms
of
devotion
she
called
herself
high
church
and
nothing
could
be
more
graceful
than
the
manner
in
which
she
glided
up
the
aisle
bowed
to
the
chancel
and
sank
on
her
knees
for
what
was
supposed
to
be
a
short
interval
of
silent
prayer
but
her
eyes
went
straight
to
the
grays
pew
the
moment
she
rose
and
from
thence
to
the
halletts
and
she
whispered
to
ethel
they
all
here
that
nice
then
she
indulged
in
a
long
stare
at
candace
who
had
come
to
church
with
her
cousins
and
who
in
her
new
foulard
with
the
hat
and
a
pair
of
the
birthday
gloves
on
her
slender
hands
looked
quite
differently
from
the
little
passenger
of
the
eolus
the
monday
before
do
look
that
the
very
girl
we
saw
on
the
boat
went
on
berenice
in
the
same
low
whisper
did
you
ever
has
gray
done
her
over
nicely
i
wonder
where
she
got
that
hat
i
wonder
what
she
has
done
with
the
old
one
given
it
to
the
cook
or
sold
it
to
the
man
retorted
berry
then
came
a
suppressed
giggle
which
ended
in
sudden
forced
gravity
as
the
opening
words
of
the
service
fell
on
their
ears
and
they
rose
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
candace
was
not
conscious
that
she
was
being
looked
at
she
had
only
once
or
twice
in
her
life
been
in
an
episcopal
church
and
never
before
in
an
old
one
trinity
seemed
to
her
as
wonderful
and
picturesque
as
some
of
the
churches
she
had
read
about
in
books
she
looked
at
the
square
pews
where
people
sat
sideways
instead
of
fronting
the
chancel
as
in
ordinary
churches
she
noted
the
tall
wands
with
gilded
tops
which
marked
the
places
of
the
junior
and
senior
wardens
the
quaint
swinging
chandeliers
of
old
brass
the
tablets
on
the
walls
two
or
three
bearing
inscriptions
in
honor
of
dead
rectors
or
other
departed
worthies
one
to
the
memory
of
a
young
girl
with
a
beautiful
flying
figure
in
carved
in
white
marble
she
gazed
with
amazement
at
the
pulpit
one
of
the
ancient
pattern
which
is
rarely
seen
with
a
clerk
desk
below
a
above
above
that
a
lofty
pulpit
for
the
clergyman
to
which
a
narrow
flight
of
stairs
gave
access
and
suspended
over
all
an
enormous
it
looked
large
and
heavy
enough
to
crush
any
clergyman
who
should
be
caught
by
its
fall
while
in
act
of
preaching
and
candace
watched
its
slight
oscillations
with
an
apprehensive
fascination
till
she
recollected
that
it
must
have
hung
there
for
a
hundred
years
at
least
so
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
would
drop
on
this
particular
sunday
by
turning
her
head
a
very
little
she
could
get
a
glimpse
of
the
with
its
quaint
little
organ
bearing
two
gilded
mitres
and
a
royal
crown
on
top
and
below
the
inscription
the
gift
of
george
berkeley
late
lord
bishop
of
cloyne
she
wondered
who
george
berkeley
could
have
been
and
resolved
to
ask
cousin
kate
as
they
went
home
if
there
was
any
story
about
him
there
was
no
whispering
or
giggling
in
gray
pew
the
girls
were
too
well
trained
for
such
irreverence
and
except
that
georgie
interchanged
one
little
smile
with
berry
joy
as
she
came
in
not
one
of
them
looked
away
from
the
clergyman
till
the
sermon
was
over
and
the
benediction
pronounced
it
had
been
an
impressive
service
to
candace
who
was
used
to
the
barer
forms
of
the
congregational
church
and
she
was
surprised
to
perceive
how
little
solemnizing
effect
it
seemed
to
have
on
the
congregation
in
general
the
moment
people
rose
from
their
knees
a
low
buzz
of
conversation
began
berry
joy
seized
on
georgie
and
gertrude
and
began
to
unfold
the
sailing
plan
as
they
walked
down
the
aisle
joy
took
possession
of
cousin
kate
everybody
seemed
to
have
something
to
say
to
somebody
candace
caught
scraps
of
different
conversations
before
she
reached
the
door
and
not
one
of
them
related
in
any
way
to
the
sermon
or
to
anything
religious
she
overheard
one
invitation
to
dinner
another
to
drive
an
inquiry
about
a
dressmaker
a
bit
of
gossip
about
a
new
engagement
a
request
for
a
recipe
for
mayonnaise
she
supposed
it
must
be
the
right
thing
to
chatter
thus
since
all
these
people
did
it
still
it
seemed
to
her
country
notions
rather
queer
the
carriage
was
waiting
in
spring
street
a
little
farther
up
the
hill
she
did
not
like
to
get
in
till
the
others
were
ready
so
she
stepped
aside
among
the
gravestones
and
looked
up
to
where
the
white
slender
spire
of
the
old
church
towered
against
the
blue
she
was
trying
to
make
out
the
episcopal
mitre
surmounted
by
the
gilded
when
gray
saw
and
beckoned
to
her
she
was
still
talking
with
joy
and
that
lady
was
saying
i
may
possibly
not
be
able
to
go
myself
but
if
i
am
prevented
i
will
see
that
the
young
folks
have
a
proper
matron
and
then
my
dear
there
captain
davis
you
know
i
never
let
berry
sail
with
any
one
else
he
so
safe
and
so
careful
and
the
weather
promises
to
be
perfect
it
certainly
is
perfect
said
gray
candace
dear
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
joy
my
cousin
miss
arden
joy
or
rather
my
niece
for
her
mother
was
like
my
own
sister
she
has
come
to
spend
the
summer
with
me
cannie
joy
is
the
mother
of
the
young
lady
who
came
down
with
you
in
the
ah
indeed
the
girls
did
not
tell
me
about
that
said
joy
well
my
dear
joy
would
have
said
my
dear
to
queen
victoria
or
the
empress
of
china
if
she
had
ever
had
the
chance
of
an
interview
with
those
potentates
you
come
to
a
charming
place
and
to
charming
relatives
i
sure
and
you
ca
fail
to
enjoy
your
summer
you
must
come
with
your
cousins
to
this
which
my
young
folks
are
getting
up
they
be
delighted
i
sure
thank
you
said
candace
timidly
glancing
at
gray
that
will
be
very
nice
said
her
cousin
cannie
has
not
been
on
the
water
yet
it
is
a
new
pleasure
for
her
at
four
you
said
mrs
joy
yes
dear
at
four
and
do
trouble
to
send
down
for
the
girls
impossible
to
tell
exactly
when
they
will
get
in
as
it
depends
on
the
wind
and
berry
will
have
the
and
can
bring
them
all
up
as
well
as
not
dear
and
joy
sailed
toward
her
carriage
where
the
two
girls
were
already
seated
i
asked
that
miss
arden
who
staying
with
the
grays
to
go
out
sailing
with
you
she
said
as
she
took
her
seat
want
another
gentleman
berry
oh
mamma
what
you
do
that
for
she
the
pokiest
little
thing
we
did
want
her
at
all
well
gray
introduced
her
and
said
she
was
almost
her
niece
and
i
thought
it
seemed
to
be
expected
gray
is
always
polite
to
our
visitors
you
know
and
i
do
like
to
seem
to
slight
any
of
hers
what
the
matter
with
the
girl
oh
nothing
the
matter
only
she
poky
and
does
seem
to
fit
in
somehow
you
would
understand
if
you
had
seen
her
the
day
she
came
gray
has
dressed
her
up
as
you
might
be
sure
she
would
but
then
she
looked
like
the
backwoods
did
she
ethel
she
seemed
enough
you
have
to
make
the
best
you
can
of
it
i
guess
for
gray
accepted
for
her
it
does
really
signify
said
berry
discontentedly
only
it
throws
the
party
all
out
of
shape
and
she
younger
than
any
of
the
rest
only
just
seventeen
georgie
says
she
a
great
deal
better
stay
at
home
with
marian
it
was
fortunate
that
candace
did
not
guess
how
unwelcome
her
company
was
to
the
of
the
party
for
the
idea
of
the
sail
was
most
delightful
to
her
she
had
never
been
out
in
a
boat
in
her
life
not
even
on
the
smallest
pond
and
she
had
just
discovered
the
strong
fascination
of
the
sea
she
longed
to
get
nearer
to
it
to
know
it
better
and
in
her
innocent
little
heart
she
thought
how
very
kind
it
was
in
joy
to
invite
me
sunday
was
always
a
particularly
pleasant
day
at
the
grays
gray
was
wont
to
declare
that
though
she
did
not
believe
in
the
jewish
sabbath
she
did
with
all
her
heart
believe
in
the
christian
day
of
rest
and
she
took
pains
to
make
it
a
happy
one
for
all
under
her
roof
she
gave
her
servants
as
much
liberty
as
she
could
simplified
their
work
and
provided
a
plenty
of
good
reading
for
such
of
them
as
stayed
at
home
her
own
time
was
much
more
at
the
service
of
her
family
than
it
could
be
on
ordinary
days
she
always
took
a
walk
with
the
girls
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
if
the
day
were
pleasant
and
kept
some
book
of
a
thoughtful
kind
to
read
aloud
in
the
evenings
this
sunday
it
happened
to
be
that
wonderful
little
prose
poem
of
oliphant
a
beleaguered
city
cannie
found
it
absorbingly
interesting
and
even
gray
laid
aside
his
newspaper
and
listened
to
the
very
end
the
reading
done
candace
found
a
chance
to
ask
her
question
about
george
berkeley
bishop
of
cloyne
the
donor
of
the
organ
there
was
a
story
about
him
as
it
turned
out
and
a
very
interesting
one
gray
told
how
when
dean
of
derry
in
ireland
the
project
of
establishing
a
college
in
bermuda
for
the
education
of
english
boys
and
of
indian
youths
to
act
as
missionaries
to
their
own
people
had
taken
possession
of
his
mind
and
he
had
given
up
his
preferment
and
crossed
the
sea
with
his
family
to
engage
in
this
chosen
work
she
described
their
landing
in
newport
on
a
sunday
morning
when
everybody
was
at
church
and
how
the
clergyman
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
sermon
and
with
all
his
congregation
following
him
hurried
down
to
the
to
receive
the
distinguished
guest
she
promised
to
take
candace
out
some
day
to
see
whitehall
the
house
which
he
built
on
the
island
and
in
which
he
lived
for
some
years
till
the
impossibility
of
carrying
out
his
scheme
for
bermuda
drove
him
back
again
to
ireland
and
also
the
rocky
shelf
still
called
bishop
berkeley
rock
where
he
is
said
to
have
composed
the
lines
which
begin
westward
the
course
of
empire
takes
its
way
then
she
looked
up
a
photograph
from
smibert
picture
of
dean
berkeley
and
his
family
to
show
them
and
by
that
time
the
girls
had
all
grown
interested
and
when
marian
said
that
she
too
wanted
to
go
to
see
whitehall
georgie
and
gertrude
begged
to
be
included
also
and
gray
promised
to
take
them
all
one
of
the
dean
little
children
is
buried
in
trinity
churchyard
cannie
she
ended
you
can
look
up
the
stone
some
day
it
has
berkeley
carved
upon
it
i
should
like
to
said
cannie
it
has
been
so
nice
to
hear
about
him
how
many
interesting
things
have
happened
in
newport
i
shall
care
a
great
deal
more
about
that
funny
little
organ
next
sunday
newport
harbor
shone
all
blue
and
silver
in
the
sun
as
the
party
stepped
on
board
the
cornelia
at
sharp
four
on
monday
afternoon
fred
allen
a
tall
graceful
brunette
seemed
as
much
of
a
girl
as
any
of
the
party
which
she
was
nominally
to
matronize
but
she
married
though
she
did
look
it
as
berry
joy
remarked
and
so
was
qualified
to
fill
the
place
there
was
a
fair
wind
which
sent
the
boat
smoothly
along
with
little
or
no
motion
as
they
glided
past
the
long
sunken
shoal
off
the
end
of
goat
island
and
opened
the
view
of
brenton
cove
with
the
wreck
of
the
old
slaver
lying
in
the
deep
shadow
under
one
bank
opposite
the
ribs
of
the
other
stranded
bark
while
from
beyond
in
the
laughing
bay
boats
flitted
to
and
fro
and
seemed
to
beckon
and
make
tempting
signals
to
the
poor
defeated
barks
who
might
never
sail
or
enjoy
the
sea
again
candace
ventured
to
ask
gertrude
in
a
whisper
what
are
those
oh
only
some
old
wrecks
replied
gertrude
carelessly
and
she
turned
from
candace
to
talk
to
tom
joy
who
sat
next
to
her
the
cornelia
was
now
running
on
the
favoring
wind
between
fort
adams
and
the
conanicut
shore
on
one
hand
lay
newport
which
looked
like
a
dream
city
in
the
soft
shine
of
the
afternoon
on
the
other
was
the
long
hill
line
of
the
island
green
with
grasses
except
where
broken
now
and
then
by
rocky
cliffs
and
indented
with
innumerable
little
coves
and
inlets
some
ending
in
strips
of
pebbly
beach
others
in
stony
shelves
overhung
by
the
water
was
beautiful
in
color
here
pale
flashing
green
there
purple
in
the
shadow
with
gleams
of
golden
light
and
a
low
reach
of
shimmering
blue
toward
the
horizon
on
sped
the
boat
till
they
could
almost
touch
the
ledges
the
rounded
outline
of
the
old
fortification
on
the
upper
hill
towered
above
their
heads
then
suddenly
she
curved
and
wheeled
off
on
the
other
tack
with
the
sharp
line
of
castle
hill
and
the
agassiz
point
full
in
view
candace
gazed
with
delighted
eyes
to
left
and
right
her
mind
was
full
of
questions
but
there
seemed
no
one
of
whom
she
could
ask
them
georgie
and
berry
were
perched
on
the
extreme
point
of
the
bow
with
a
young
man
stretched
at
their
feet
fred
was
on
the
cabin
roof
amidships
with
quite
a
little
court
of
girls
and
young
men
about
her
the
couples
who
sat
opposite
and
beside
her
seemed
quite
absorbed
in
each
other
no
one
had
spoken
to
candace
since
the
first
introductions
and
she
was
too
shy
to
open
a
conversation
with
anybody
how
i
wish
i
knew
she
sighed
to
herself
half
aloud
looking
up
she
met
the
shrewd
twinkling
eyes
of
the
captain
perhaps
he
had
caught
the
words
for
he
asked
encouragingly
did
you
speak
miss
no
said
candace
i
do
think
i
spoke
but
i
was
wondering
about
that
that
up
there
pointing
to
the
fort
that
that
fort
dumpling
as
folks
call
it
it
is
a
kind
of
a
queer
old
place
ai
it
they
do
use
it
now
for
no
war
purposes
but
it
makes
a
pretty
in
the
landscape
and
folks
go
there
for
picnics
and
such
in
the
summer
season
when
was
it
built
asked
candace
charmed
to
find
somebody
able
and
willing
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
i
reckon
it
was
about
when
we
was
the
british
for
the
last
time
very
much
of
a
fort
to
look
at
but
if
you
was
to
mount
some
of
them
powerful
guns
they
make
now
on
the
walls
them
and
the
others
over
at
fort
adams
yonder
would
protect
the
channel
pretty
well
the
shot
reach
clear
across
why
you
hardly
think
it
perhaps
but
not
four
or
five
years
ago
there
was
some
folks
who
had
come
on
a
kind
of
an
excursion
taking
their
lunches
up
there
by
fort
dumpling
and
some
soldiers
was
firing
at
a
target
over
there
to
fort
adams
and
one
of
the
balls
came
over
and
hit
a
young
lady
how
dreadful
said
candace
her
eyes
measuring
the
long
distance
between
the
two
points
and
it
seems
so
far
away
i
suppose
the
young
lady
felt
perfectly
safe
i
am
sure
i
should
have
did
it
kill
her
oh
no
they
thought
at
first
it
had
but
it
did
turn
out
so
bad
as
was
expected
the
soldiers
they
felt
mighty
mean
i
expect
you
see
they
did
intend
a
mite
of
harm
to
her
or
anybody
but
it
just
shows
how
far
them
big
guns
carry
a
now
unless
she
was
some
kind
of
a
monitor
or
that
would
stand
a
fair
chance
of
being
stove
and
sent
to
the
bottom
before
she
could
get
in
to
attack
newport
what
a
fanny
little
house
that
is
close
down
to
the
water
remarked
candace
looking
off
to
the
opposite
shore
that
professor
agassiz
laboratory
do
y
see
that
kind
of
a
cove
which
sets
in
there
near
by
the
building
and
a
little
black
thing
sticking
up
out
of
it
that
the
pipe
of
his
he
and
the
rest
go
out
in
it
and
dredge
for
fish
and
such
like
and
then
they
experiment
on
them
inside
what
do
they
do
that
for
asked
candace
they
want
to
find
out
about
i
reckon
i
was
in
there
once
and
saw
them
at
work
but
i
could
make
nothing
out
of
it
and
there
was
anybody
i
could
ask
oh
what
is
that
cried
candace
as
the
cornelia
tacking
again
opened
one
of
the
little
bays
on
the
south
end
of
conanicut
where
a
small
steam
vessel
was
lying
two
boats
which
seemed
to
belong
to
her
were
rowing
in
a
parallel
line
with
each
other
and
behind
them
appeared
a
long
line
of
bobbing
points
which
she
could
not
at
all
understand
that
one
of
the
fishing
steamers
and
the
boats
are
drawing
her
nets
explained
the
captain
did
you
ever
see
a
seine
drawn
before
i
declare
i
mighty
glad
we
happened
just
in
time
for
it
a
spectacle
i
guess
we
kind
of
hang
about
till
they
get
the
nets
in
and
then
i
take
the
up
near
enough
for
you
to
see
captain
there
are
the
out
called
tom
joy
at
the
same
moment
let
sail
up
and
see
what
they
caught
the
two
boats
began
to
near
each
other
as
they
reached
the
limits
of
the
long
elliptical
curves
which
made
their
course
and
presently
a
great
number
of
scintillating
specks
were
seen
in
the
space
enclosed
between
them
there
were
the
leaping
fish
just
conscious
that
they
were
crowded
into
a
confined
place
and
desirous
of
escape
when
they
were
quite
close
to
one
another
the
boats
turned
and
began
to
row
for
the
steamer
the
cornelia
followed
and
the
captain
with
a
twist
of
the
tiller
threw
her
into
the
wind
just
beyond
the
great
net
which
by
that
time
was
being
rapidly
hauled
in
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
see
the
heavy
mass
of
floundering
fishes
pouring
over
into
the
steamer
hold
thousands
and
thousands
of
quivering
silvery
shapes
of
all
kinds
from
the
fat
menhaden
to
weird
horned
monsters
with
gaping
mouths
and
strange
blocks
like
jelly
which
seemed
to
have
no
mouths
at
all
large
and
small
pinky
white
black
blue
in
they
poured
now
and
then
some
fish
more
lucky
than
his
fellows
would
splash
over
the
side
of
the
net
and
escape
to
liberty
and
the
deep
sea
now
and
then
a
fisherman
with
a
sudden
dash
of
his
hand
would
single
out
a
specimen
choicer
than
the
rest
a
a
chicken
cod
or
a
the
little
company
in
the
shared
all
the
excitement
of
the
catch
the
young
men
left
their
flirtations
for
the
boat
side
where
they
could
get
a
better
view
a
great
deal
of
chaff
went
on
between
captain
davis
and
the
captain
of
the
menhaden
steamer
tom
joy
amused
himself
by
bargaining
for
and
actually
bought
three
big
flapping
specimens
for
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
they
were
deposited
on
the
bottom
of
the
cornelia
where
they
leaped
painfully
up
and
down
while
the
girls
retreated
for
refuge
to
the
upper
deck
till
captain
davis
at
last
caught
the
fish
and
stowed
them
away
in
his
little
cabin
it
was
not
till
the
last
loop
of
the
seine
was
emptied
the
last
fish
secured
and
the
boats
were
making
ready
for
another
cast
that
the
cornelia
finally
glided
away
and
by
that
time
a
soft
crimson
glow
had
gathered
in
the
west
and
the
sun
was
nearing
the
horizon
edge
the
wind
blew
more
freshly
now
and
with
a
zest
and
coolness
which
it
had
not
had
earlier
in
the
afternoon
captain
davis
pointed
out
to
candace
the
anchored
in
the
offing
between
point
judith
and
brenton
reef
and
told
her
how
the
men
who
lived
on
board
of
her
did
not
see
a
face
from
land
for
weeks
together
sometimes
when
winds
were
stormy
and
waves
rough
candace
listened
eagerly
the
rest
of
the
party
had
gone
back
to
their
old
places
but
there
was
not
so
much
chatter
now
the
dreamy
influences
of
the
hour
were
felt
by
every
one
dick
foster
was
quoting
tennyson
in
a
low
voice
to
pretty
julia
prime
berry
joy
and
georgie
still
kept
up
a
fitful
conversation
with
their
cavalier
but
gertrude
had
grown
silent
and
tom
joy
was
whistling
softly
to
himself
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
sunset
the
cornelia
sped
silently
seaward
suddenly
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
a
deep
cove
at
the
very
end
of
conanicut
and
close
by
them
rose
out
of
the
sea
an
immense
square
table
of
rock
over
which
still
as
it
was
the
surge
was
constantly
flinging
showers
of
white
spray
the
whole
top
of
this
rock
was
black
with
large
candace
had
never
imagined
such
a
sight
the
birds
seemed
crowding
each
other
on
every
inch
of
space
each
moment
some
of
them
would
rise
wheel
in
air
with
wild
cries
and
screams
and
then
settle
again
to
dispute
for
room
while
the
seething
foam
splashed
over
them
and
the
incessant
flutter
of
their
wings
the
dashing
spray
and
the
long
wash
of
waves
at
the
base
of
the
rock
gave
to
their
place
of
refuge
the
effect
of
movement
so
that
it
seemed
to
sway
and
float
in
the
sea
oh
what
a
wonderful
place
cried
candace
such
big
birds
and
so
many
of
them
what
do
you
call
them
captain
they
mostly
cormorants
and
gulls
i
reckon
that
what
we
call
them
down
to
newport
they
ai
no
good
for
eating
so
they
get
shot
and
they
do
increase
powerfully
though
it
seems
to
me
i
never
did
see
quite
so
many
on
the
kettle
bottom
before
as
this
afternoon
is
that
the
name
of
the
rock
yes
the
kettle
bottom
rock
that
what
it
called
it
a
queer
place
there
was
a
painter
here
last
summer
and
he
made
a
picter
of
it
with
them
birds
all
flying
over
it
which
folks
said
was
as
like
as
like
the
line
of
hotels
on
narragansett
beach
was
now
plainly
in
sight
they
were
almost
off
beaver
tail
and
the
sea
was
rougher
captain
we
may
as
well
put
about
said
tom
joy
the
sun
going
down
and
there
rather
more
motion
hereabouts
than
the
ladies
like
so
they
put
about
and
sped
harborward
helped
by
the
tide
which
was
now
running
swiftly
in
frank
rivington
began
to
sing
in
a
mellow
tenor
voice
little
barcarolles
and
venetian
which
were
full
of
a
measured
rhythmic
movement
like
and
the
beat
of
waves
the
pink
in
the
west
deepened
after
the
sun
went
down
to
a
vivid
orange
red
and
flamed
higher
and
higher
till
the
zenith
caught
the
glow
and
a
little
crescent
moon
which
was
climbing
up
swung
like
a
tiny
silver
boat
on
a
crimson
tide
it
was
all
like
a
dream
to
which
the
noiseless
speed
of
the
boat
offered
no
interruption
captain
said
candace
gently
as
the
cornelia
touched
the
wharf
at
the
upper
end
of
which
the
carriages
were
waiting
for
them
i
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
telling
me
all
about
the
things
you
welcome
i
sure
replied
the
hearty
captain
it
been
nothing
but
a
pleasure
so
far
as
i
concerned
hope
i
may
take
you
out
sailing
again
miss
oh
i
hope
so
i
think
sailing
is
lovely
miss
arden
i
hope
you
have
enjoyed
it
said
allen
as
she
was
borne
off
by
her
husband
it
was
the
sole
remark
addressed
by
the
matron
of
the
party
to
the
little
stranger
under
her
care
during
that
afternoon
but
candace
had
not
felt
neglected
oh
yes
very
much
thank
you
she
replied
tom
joy
who
had
waked
up
to
the
sense
that
the
little
girl
in
the
red
hat
had
not
had
much
attention
paid
her
on
the
sail
tried
to
get
up
a
conversation
as
the
climbed
the
hill
but
candace
had
but
little
small
talk
at
her
command
and
they
did
not
get
on
very
fluently
i
had
a
lovely
time
miss
joy
she
said
shyly
as
they
were
set
down
at
home
i
sure
i
glad
miss
arden
and
that
was
all
the
notice
which
berenice
joy
took
of
her
youngest
guest
beyond
the
necessary
when
they
first
met
on
the
wharf
candace
was
too
unexacting
and
too
much
accustomed
to
think
of
herself
as
a
child
to
whom
no
particular
attention
was
due
to
realize
or
resent
being
treated
with
this
scant
courtesy
she
told
cousin
kate
about
the
sail
and
the
seine
steamer
and
all
the
captain
tales
and
explanations
with
a
glow
of
enjoyment
which
surprised
gertrude
and
perhaps
pricked
her
conscience
somewhat
for
that
night
at
time
she
surprised
georgie
by
the
observation
after
all
cannie
is
quite
a
sweet
little
thing
so
she
is
sweet
enough
but
what
makes
you
think
of
it
just
now
why
we
rather
left
her
out
this
afternoon
i
am
afraid
hardly
anybody
said
a
word
to
her
except
the
captain
it
was
rude
enough
of
berry
for
it
was
her
party
but
i
think
it
was
worse
for
us
any
other
girl
would
have
been
hurt
and
cross
and
showed
it
but
cannie
never
seemed
to
mind
a
bit
and
enjoyed
everything
and
was
just
as
nice
and
pleasant
as
if
she
had
been
the
belle
of
the
party
well
it
too
bad
said
georgie
penitently
i
never
thought
about
it
and
i
sat
ever
so
far
off
from
her
and
arnold
foster
was
so
funny
in
fact
i
forgot
cannie
i
took
it
for
granted
that
she
was
being
entertained
somehow
i
afraid
both
of
us
find
it
pretty
easy
to
forget
cannie
remarked
gertrude
well
i
shall
try
to
do
better
another
time
chapter
vi
a
talk
about
shyness
cannie
said
gray
a
few
days
after
the
would
you
like
to
study
french
this
summer
with
marian
for
company
replied
cannie
but
she
said
it
more
because
she
saw
that
a
yes
was
expected
of
her
than
because
of
any
real
pleasure
at
the
idea
like
most
girls
who
have
had
scanty
or
poor
teaching
she
liked
to
read
a
great
deal
better
than
she
liked
to
study
do
you
know
any
french
at
all
continued
her
cousin
no
not
any
there
was
anybody
at
home
who
taught
it
and
if
there
had
been
i
do
believe
aunt
myra
would
have
let
me
learn
she
thinks
english
is
a
good
enough
language
for
anybody
i
did
study
latin
a
little
while
though
aunt
myra
consented
to
that
because
we
had
latin
books
in
the
house
and
she
said
they
might
as
well
be
useful
well
your
latin
wo
come
amiss
to
your
french
said
gray
laughing
to
herself
over
this
thrifty
reason
for
learning
a
language
marian
is
of
course
far
ahead
of
you
in
speaking
for
she
learned
it
by
ear
as
they
say
of
music
during
the
year
we
spent
in
france
on
our
way
home
but
she
knows
but
little
of
the
rules
and
grammar
i
think
you
will
do
very
well
together
for
her
fluency
will
tempt
you
on
to
talk
and
your
perseverance
will
keep
her
up
to
the
exercises
and
conjugations
which
are
sad
drudgery
but
very
needful
if
you
are
ever
really
to
know
anything
of
the
language
you
are
persevering
are
you
not
cannie
i
do
know
whether
i
am
or
not
replied
candace
inly
resolving
to
justify
cousin
kate
good
opinion
i
have
confidence
in
you
said
gray
smiling
kindly
at
her
and
another
thing
i
wanted
to
say
is
that
i
think
both
you
and
marian
will
enjoy
the
summer
a
great
deal
better
for
having
one
regular
study
to
prepare
for
it
gives
a
sort
of
backbone
to
your
lives
do
you
see
clear
fun
is
like
clear
honey
it
cloys
and
loses
its
charm
but
when
it
is
mixed
with
occupation
it
keeps
its
flavor
and
you
do
get
tired
of
it
i
can
understand
that
said
candace
thoughtfully
i
recollect
how
nice
saturday
afternoons
used
to
seem
when
aunt
myra
had
kept
me
busy
darning
stockings
all
the
morning
i
think
i
like
the
french
lessons
cousin
kate
only
i
am
afraid
the
teacher
will
think
me
very
stupid
candace
fears
were
not
realized
as
a
beginner
her
first
steps
were
necessarily
slow
but
she
took
pains
and
had
no
bad
habits
or
evil
accents
to
unlearn
and
after
a
while
she
got
hold
of
the
language
and
went
on
more
rapidly
marian
fluent
chatter
stimulated
her
to
try
to
talk
as
fast
also
though
mademoiselle
bougereau
their
teacher
found
a
great
deal
of
fault
with
marian
and
said
that
many
of
the
phrases
which
came
so
glibly
out
of
her
mouth
partook
of
the
nature
of
slang
and
were
not
finished
or
elegant
french
still
with
all
drawbacks
the
little
class
of
two
made
fair
progress
and
candace
realized
that
what
gray
had
said
was
true
and
that
all
the
bits
of
amusement
and
pleasure
which
came
in
her
way
were
doubly
enjoyed
by
reason
of
the
little
backbone
of
real
work
thus
put
into
her
days
another
pleasure
which
she
and
marian
shared
in
common
was
a
before
breakfast
berry
joy
had
got
up
an
omnibus
party
of
girls
which
she
called
the
early
dip
club
in
which
all
four
of
gray
young
people
were
included
punctually
at
a
quarter
before
seven
on
every
fair
morning
the
omnibus
rattled
up
the
avenue
and
the
club
set
out
under
the
care
of
an
old
experienced
maid
of
joy
who
had
nursed
berry
and
could
be
trusted
to
see
that
none
of
the
young
ladies
did
anything
very
imprudent
such
as
staying
too
long
in
the
water
or
standing
about
in
their
wet
at
that
early
hour
there
were
no
loungers
to
stare
at
the
party
the
beach
cleanly
swept
by
the
tide
of
the
night
before
had
scarcely
a
footprint
to
mar
its
smooth
firm
sands
there
was
something
delightful
in
the
perfect
freshness
of
the
hour
and
place
some
of
the
girls
had
taken
lessons
in
the
school
of
natation
in
the
lower
bay
and
could
swim
very
well
candace
could
not
swim
and
made
no
attempt
to
learn
but
she
soon
acquired
the
art
of
floating
under
the
tuition
of
alice
frewen
who
next
to
marian
and
herself
was
the
youngest
of
the
party
and
to
whom
she
had
taken
a
great
fancy
the
three
children
as
berenice
joy
called
them
made
common
cause
and
generally
kept
together
a
little
apart
from
the
others
holding
each
other
hands
and
splashing
up
and
down
in
the
rollers
with
great
enjoyment
bathing
over
the
early
dippers
returned
home
in
their
omnibus
about
the
time
that
other
people
were
waking
up
bringing
with
them
such
cheeks
and
such
appetites
as
were
a
satisfaction
to
their
families
and
did
great
credit
to
the
powers
of
the
newport
surf
so
the
days
sped
on
it
was
full
now
yet
the
weather
never
seemed
hot
except
perhaps
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
morning
after
morning
the
sun
would
rise
in
a
blaze
of
yellow
which
anywhere
else
would
have
betokened
a
scorching
day
and
just
as
people
had
begun
to
say
what
a
sultry
morning
lo
in
one
moment
the
wind
would
set
in
from
the
sea
strong
salty
fresh
invigorating
and
behold
it
was
cool
or
if
the
afternoon
seemed
for
a
little
while
oppressive
in
the
streets
of
the
old
town
it
was
only
necessary
to
go
down
to
the
end
of
the
avenue
to
find
a
temperature
cool
enough
to
be
called
chilly
nobody
ever
thought
of
driving
without
a
shawl
and
the
shawl
was
almost
always
needed
gray
was
wont
to
say
that
newport
had
three
different
climates
a
warm
one
and
a
cold
one
and
an
one
and
it
had
them
all
three
every
day
and
people
could
take
their
choice
which
was
much
more
convenient
than
having
only
one
the
large
places
on
the
cliffs
were
all
open
and
occupied
now
the
newly
planted
when
candace
came
made
wonderful
spaces
of
color
everywhere
in
the
emerald
turf
geraniums
seemed
as
universal
as
grass
and
their
splendid
reds
and
pinks
were
such
as
are
seldom
seen
anywhere
except
in
newport
foliage
plants
grew
into
enormous
crimson
or
golden
mats
which
showed
not
one
break
in
their
luxuriant
fulness
in
the
more
ornate
places
were
beds
planted
to
look
like
turkish
carpets
or
indian
shawls
the
pattern
reproduced
by
hundreds
of
small
plants
of
carefully
adjusted
hues
kept
closely
shaven
so
as
to
lie
as
flat
as
the
objects
they
simulated
roses
were
everywhere
and
the
soft
drifting
mists
which
now
and
again
blew
in
from
the
sea
and
the
constant
underlying
moisture
of
the
climate
kept
everything
in
a
state
of
perfect
freshness
the
casino
balls
and
matches
had
begun
visitors
were
pouring
into
the
ocean
house
and
every
day
increased
the
number
of
carriages
drags
pony
phaetons
and
village
carts
which
on
all
bright
afternoons
thronged
the
avenue
from
end
to
end
dinners
and
were
of
frequent
occurrence
and
during
the
bell
seemed
always
in
vibration
at
the
gray
cottage
i
call
it
for
in
newport
everything
that
is
not
a
villa
is
styled
a
cottage
no
matter
how
big
or
square
or
uncompromising
its
appearance
may
be
candace
was
rather
too
young
to
be
taken
into
general
society
and
she
saw
much
less
of
these
entertainments
than
georgie
less
even
than
gertrude
who
by
reason
of
her
intimacy
with
georgie
set
was
often
included
in
their
parties
though
not
yet
formally
out
gray
however
thought
it
good
for
candace
to
share
a
little
of
what
was
going
on
and
she
took
pains
to
have
her
invited
now
and
then
with
the
others
to
excursions
or
afternoon
teas
if
gray
herself
was
present
on
these
occasions
cannie
did
pretty
well
for
she
invariably
got
behind
her
cousin
or
beside
her
made
no
attempt
to
talk
and
just
amused
herself
by
watching
what
went
on
but
when
gray
did
not
go
and
she
was
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
georgie
and
gertrude
she
was
apt
to
feel
lonely
and
unfriended
for
with
all
the
better
resolutions
of
these
young
people
they
still
found
it
easy
to
forget
cannie
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
morning
children
asked
gray
one
day
at
breakfast
is
the
great
that
we
have
heard
so
much
about
to
come
off
or
have
i
forgotten
the
date
no
this
is
the
eventful
day
replied
gertrude
and
i
am
so
nervous
about
it
that
i
do
feel
as
if
i
could
play
at
all
nonsense
you
played
beautifully
yesterday
said
georgie
there
was
anything
depending
on
me
yesterday
it
is
queer
how
people
never
do
their
best
when
it
is
important
that
they
should
i
feel
as
if
i
were
going
to
be
all
thumbs
this
morning
oh
you
wo
you
get
excited
and
forget
about
the
thumbs
remarked
georgie
consolingly
mamma
are
you
coming
to
see
us
yes
i
think
i
shall
and
i
will
bring
cannie
with
me
she
has
seen
the
casino
yet
candace
had
become
familiar
with
the
street
side
of
the
pretty
casino
building
and
admired
greatly
its
long
fa√ßade
with
the
quaintly
shingled
curves
and
balconies
and
the
low
gables
ornamented
with
disks
and
half
suns
in
dull
gilding
all
looking
gray
said
as
old
as
if
it
had
stood
there
for
a
couple
of
centuries
instead
of
for
three
or
four
years
only
but
the
street
side
picturesque
as
it
is
had
by
no
means
prepared
her
for
what
she
saw
as
she
followed
her
cousin
through
the
entrance
hall
and
into
the
quadrangle
beyond
what
did
she
see
an
open
space
of
greenest
turf
broken
only
by
two
long
curving
beds
of
foliage
plants
and
a
stone
basin
from
which
a
fountain
threw
up
a
cool
jet
to
refresh
the
air
on
either
hand
and
on
the
side
from
which
they
had
entered
was
a
line
of
low
buildings
with
balconies
and
of
quaintly
designed
windows
filled
with
oddly
tinted
glass
and
at
one
point
a
clock
tower
of
rough
masonry
over
which
vines
were
clustering
connecting
the
buildings
to
right
and
left
was
a
raised
covered
gallery
in
shape
with
a
second
gallery
overhead
and
on
these
ladies
in
fresh
morning
toilettes
were
sitting
some
with
pieces
of
embroidery
in
their
hands
others
collected
in
knots
for
conversation
or
to
listen
to
the
music
of
the
band
beyond
this
gallery
lay
another
and
much
larger
quadrangle
with
lines
of
trees
and
shrubs
to
veil
its
boundaries
on
which
was
being
played
in
five
or
six
courts
at
once
at
the
back
of
this
quadrangle
was
another
long
low
building
in
the
same
picturesque
style
as
the
rest
which
gray
explained
contained
on
one
side
a
charming
little
theatre
which
could
also
be
used
as
a
and
on
the
other
an
admirable
and
for
the
use
of
the
members
the
band
was
playing
gay
music
a
hum
of
conversation
filled
the
air
pretty
girls
in
white
or
blue
or
rose
color
were
moving
about
the
wind
drew
with
delicious
coolness
through
the
galleries
altogether
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
on
a
summer
morning
a
prettier
place
or
a
livelier
scene
gray
was
too
much
of
a
favorite
not
to
be
at
once
sought
out
she
was
soon
the
centre
of
a
little
group
of
friends
and
candace
sat
beside
her
silent
as
usual
but
gazing
with
enchanted
eyes
at
the
animated
figures
on
the
tennis
ground
at
the
gables
and
loggias
of
the
restaurant
building
at
the
curious
with
the
heavy
iron
rings
depending
above
the
base
and
its
top
like
a
bellflower
it
was
all
like
a
fairy
tale
to
her
her
imagination
was
actively
at
work
but
no
one
would
have
guessed
it
from
her
quiet
little
face
and
when
gray
introduced
her
to
one
person
and
another
she
shrank
into
herself
and
after
her
shy
little
bow
and
how
do
you
do
relapsed
again
into
stillness
and
made
no
attempt
to
keep
up
a
conversation
people
were
kind
but
it
is
always
easy
to
secure
solitude
in
a
crowd
and
cannie
soon
found
herself
let
alone
to
her
heart
content
gertrude
was
playing
her
best
her
nervousness
had
disappeared
in
the
excitement
of
the
game
as
georgie
had
predicted
that
it
would
and
some
of
her
strokes
were
so
clever
as
to
win
a
little
volley
of
applause
from
the
candace
did
not
know
the
game
well
enough
to
appreciate
fine
points
of
play
but
she
could
perfectly
appreciate
the
fun
of
winning
and
when
gertrude
flushed
and
radiant
came
to
show
her
mother
the
prize
she
had
won
a
lace
pin
of
gold
filigree
in
the
form
of
a
racket
cannie
face
lighted
up
with
a
bright
sympathy
which
was
pleasant
to
see
a
lady
who
had
been
watching
her
whispered
to
gray
what
a
sweet
face
that
little
niece
of
yours
has
so
she
has
replied
gray
only
she
is
so
very
timid
she
never
does
herself
justice
is
it
timidity
i
had
a
fancy
that
she
had
an
unhappy
temper
or
was
troubled
about
something
her
face
has
always
seemed
so
sad
and
overcast
till
just
now
when
it
lit
up
at
gertrude
good
fortune
and
then
i
caught
the
true
expression
gray
recollected
this
remark
as
she
drove
home
with
candace
who
perfectly
at
ease
now
that
she
was
alone
with
her
cousin
kate
chattered
and
laughed
like
any
other
girl
and
showed
herself
the
happy
young
thing
that
she
was
at
home
even
when
with
georgie
and
gertrude
she
was
no
longer
shy
but
the
moment
a
stranger
came
in
all
was
changed
it
was
like
an
evil
spell
cast
by
some
enchanter
the
pleasant
smile
and
simple
childish
manner
vanished
and
cannie
became
stiff
cold
awkward
even
for
her
discomfort
made
her
feel
constrained
in
every
limb
and
muscle
her
manner
grew
frigid
because
she
was
frightened
and
wanted
to
hide
it
if
she
had
to
shake
hands
she
did
it
without
smiling
and
with
downcast
eyes
she
was
too
ill
at
ease
to
be
cordial
people
thought
that
she
was
out
of
humor
or
troubled
about
something
and
set
her
down
as
dull
and
unattractive
and
with
a
natural
reaction
cannie
felt
that
they
did
not
like
her
and
that
made
her
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
gray
pitied
cannie
very
much
and
had
tried
various
methods
to
shake
her
out
of
her
shyness
and
teach
her
confidence
in
herself
none
of
them
so
far
had
done
any
good
she
now
began
to
wonder
if
her
analysis
of
the
case
was
not
wrong
if
shyness
was
not
a
fault
rather
than
a
misfortune
and
needed
to
be
disciplined
accordingly
she
watched
candace
for
a
day
or
two
and
then
she
made
up
her
mind
it
will
be
kill
or
cure
she
thought
as
she
ordered
the
coup√©
and
proposed
to
cannie
to
take
the
ocean
drive
marian
wanted
to
go
too
and
protested
that
there
was
plenty
of
room
on
the
little
seat
and
that
she
would
crowd
them
a
bit
but
her
mother
was
quite
firm
and
despatched
her
on
an
errand
in
the
other
direction
without
any
compunctions
i
must
have
cannie
all
to
myself
she
thought
it
was
not
till
they
were
out
of
the
avenue
and
rolling
along
the
smooth
road
beyond
bailey
beach
with
the
ponds
on
one
hand
and
on
the
other
the
points
and
indentations
of
the
coast
that
gray
led
to
the
subject
which
was
on
her
mind
the
sea
was
intensely
blue
that
afternoon
with
shoots
of
creamy
foam
over
every
rock
and
ledge
and
for
a
while
they
talked
of
nothing
but
the
beauty
of
the
day
and
the
view
finally
gray
began
how
did
you
like
mrs
endicott
endicott
was
one
of
various
visitors
who
had
called
that
morning
candace
had
been
sent
for
and
had
been
more
than
usually
awkward
and
unresponsive
i
liked
her
pretty
well
said
candace
she
did
talk
to
me
but
a
little
while
i
know
she
did
it
was
on
her
account
specially
that
i
sent
for
you
to
come
down
continued
gray
did
she
tell
you
that
she
was
at
school
with
your
mother
when
they
were
quite
little
girls
no
said
candace
surprised
yes
they
were
great
friends
and
she
wrote
to
me
before
she
came
up
that
she
was
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
shall
i
tell
you
why
she
so
soon
stopped
talking
to
you
she
told
me
afterward
she
said
wanted
to
talk
to
your
niece
about
her
mother
and
to
ask
her
to
come
to
me
for
a
visit
but
she
looked
so
frightened
and
seemed
so
stiff
and
shy
and
hard
to
get
at
that
i
thought
the
kindest
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
let
her
alone
for
the
moment
till
she
was
a
little
more
used
to
me
and
to
talk
to
some
one
else
next
time
i
come
we
shall
get
on
better
i
hope
candace
looked
much
mortified
was
i
stiff
she
asked
i
did
know
it
i
did
mean
to
be
you
are
almost
always
stiff
with
strangers
said
her
cousin
i
know
you
do
not
mean
it
and
you
are
not
conscious
of
the
effect
of
your
own
manner
but
all
the
same
it
is
stiff
now
cannie
will
you
promise
me
not
to
be
hurt
at
what
i
am
going
to
say
why
of
course
i
wo
said
cannie
looking
at
her
with
trustful
eyes
well
then
listen
if
i
did
know
you
if
you
were
not
my
own
dear
little
cannie
whose
warm
heart
i
am
sure
of
and
whose
good
intentions
i
know
all
about
if
i
met
you
for
the
first
time
and
judged
of
you
merely
from
your
manner
as
all
strangers
must
judge
do
you
know
what
i
should
think
what
i
should
think
you
rather
a
girl
who
did
like
people
and
did
mind
letting
them
know
it
oh
cousin
kate
or
else
if
i
were
more
charitably
inclined
i
should
think
you
a
dull
girl
who
did
not
take
much
interest
in
what
went
on
about
her
oh
cousin
kate
or
continued
her
cousin
relentlessly
if
i
were
a
real
angel
and
disposed
to
make
the
very
best
of
everybody
i
should
say
to
myself
poor
thing
is
so
shy
that
she
ca
show
what
she
really
is
unluckily
there
are
few
perfect
angels
in
this
world
and
a
great
many
of
the
other
sort
and
even
as
a
perfect
angel
my
dear
cannie
i
think
i
should
consider
you
exactly
agreeable
but
what
can
i
do
demanded
candace
looking
very
unhappy
i
make
myself
not
shy
no
but
you
can
mend
matters
by
forcing
yourself
to
hide
your
shyness
i
have
been
meditating
on
the
subject
cannie
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
shyness
is
one
form
of
selfishness
cousin
kate
how
can
you
say
that
i
thought
selfishness
was
doing
what
you
liked
and
what
is
pleasant
i
sure
i
do
to
be
shy
oh
it
not
that
kind
of
selfishness
said
gray
smiling
there
is
nothing
pleasant
about
shyness
that
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
but
ca
you
see
that
it
is
the
being
absorbed
with
your
own
sensations
and
feelings
and
with
trying
to
imagine
what
people
are
thinking
about
you
that
makes
you
so
miserable
if
you
could
forget
and
occupy
yourself
with
others
this
shyness
would
go
now
this
morning
had
you
been
full
of
endicott
and
what
she
was
like
and
what
she
wanted
to
talk
about
instead
of
little
candace
arden
and
what
endicott
considered
her
like
it
would
all
have
been
different
and
much
pleasanter
for
both
of
you
oh
if
i
only
could
said
candace
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
would
give
anything
i
have
in
the
world
i
hate
to
seem
so
awkward
and
dull
but
you
no
idea
how
uncomfortable
i
feel
cousin
kate
the
moment
i
come
downstairs
and
see
that
roomful
of
company
my
face
twitches
and
my
cheeks
burn
and
i
ca
think
of
anything
to
say
and
i
keep
wishing
i
could
run
upstairs
again
and
hide
somewhere
yes
because
as
i
said
your
mind
is
full
of
yourself
if
instead
of
coming
in
with
this
miserable
full
upon
you
you
could
look
upon
the
roomful
as
just
so
many
people
to
whom
you
owe
the
little
duties
of
politeness
and
cordiality
for
whom
you
have
the
chance
to
do
something
kind
or
pleasant
you
would
forget
your
face
and
your
cheeks
and
the
desire
to
run
away
you
would
be
thinking
of
them
and
in
thinking
of
them
you
would
forget
to
be
shy
candace
did
not
reply
you
are
a
conscientious
child
her
cousin
went
on
i
think
that
you
sincerely
wish
to
do
what
is
right
and
to
make
god
rule
the
rule
of
your
life
and
candace
in
my
opinion
you
should
consider
it
a
part
of
religious
duty
to
try
to
get
rid
of
this
false
shame
this
bondage
to
the
idea
of
self
and
to
learn
to
live
for
others
instead
candace
looked
up
with
the
dawn
of
a
new
idea
in
her
face
how
do
you
mean
she
asked
you
can
not
always
run
away
continued
her
cousin
big
as
it
is
the
world
is
not
big
enough
to
furnish
for
all
the
people
who
are
afraid
to
face
their
and
since
you
can
not
run
away
your
plain
duty
is
to
be
brave
and
make
the
best
of
it
now
cannie
there
are
two
things
which
may
help
you
to
do
this
two
thoughts
which
you
can
keep
in
mind
and
i
wish
you
would
try
to
remember
them
when
you
feel
a
fit
of
fright
or
of
stiffness
coming
on
what
are
they
one
is
that
you
are
but
one
little
insignificant
atom
among
thousands
people
are
not
thinking
about
you
or
noticing
you
very
particularly
you
are
not
of
much
consequence
except
to
yourself
and
the
few
friends
who
love
you
this
would
be
a
mortifying
fact
if
vanity
were
your
trouble
but
as
it
is
not
it
is
a
comfortable
one
and
just
as
nobody
notices
you
specially
so
all
the
world
is
not
engaged
afterward
in
recollecting
all
your
little
mistakes
and
the
stupid
things
you
have
said
unless
you
have
done
something
queer
they
forget
about
you
as
soon
as
they
lose
sight
of
you
i
know
what
miseries
sensitive
girls
undergo
in
thinking
over
their
foolish
speeches
and
actions
and
imagining
that
every
one
remembers
them
as
distinctly
as
they
themselves
do
cannie
could
help
smiling
cousin
kate
how
can
you
know
about
all
those
things
she
asked
because
i
was
a
girl
myself
once
and
as
foolish
as
any
of
the
rest
of
you
and
i
have
not
forgotten
how
it
feels
to
be
a
girl
said
her
cousin
gayly
that
is
the
use
of
growing
old
cannie
you
can
show
the
way
to
younger
people
and
make
the
road
you
have
walked
over
a
little
easier
for
but
to
go
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
our
own
insignificance
is
one
helpful
thought
as
i
said
the
other
is
that
kindliness
is
one
of
the
christian
virtues
and
it
is
just
as
much
a
duty
to
practise
it
as
it
is
to
be
honest
and
temperate
candace
drew
a
long
breath
it
would
be
perfectly
delightful
to
keep
thinking
like
that
always
she
said
the
only
thing
is
that
i
am
afraid
i
should
forget
when
the
time
came
i
wish
you
could
give
me
an
exact
rule
cousin
kate
just
what
to
say
and
how
to
act
i
would
try
ever
so
hard
to
follow
it
i
know
you
would
said
gray
but
there
is
no
exact
rule
that
i
can
give
except
the
golden
one
to
do
to
others
just
as
you
would
like
them
to
do
to
you
if
you
feel
stiff
be
sure
to
look
cordial
smile
and
shake
hands
as
if
you
meant
it
try
to
look
interested
in
what
people
are
saying
to
you
a
good
listener
helps
on
conversation
as
well
as
a
good
talker
if
you
are
friendly
and
warm
in
your
manner
other
people
will
warm
to
you
instinctively
try
it
cannie
and
see
if
i
am
not
right
and
now
we
will
not
talk
any
more
about
ourselves
or
our
shyness
but
drive
into
the
fort
and
listen
to
the
music
i
caught
a
strain
from
the
band
just
then
and
i
recollect
that
this
is
a
day
so
in
they
drove
clattered
between
walls
and
embankments
and
over
a
steep
paved
incline
beneath
a
great
arch
and
found
themselves
in
an
open
square
with
buildings
of
solid
masonry
on
all
sides
in
the
midst
of
which
the
band
was
stationed
other
carriages
were
drawn
up
to
listen
to
the
music
and
officers
in
uniform
were
coming
and
going
and
talking
to
the
ladies
in
the
carriages
one
of
these
officers
a
nice
old
major
with
a
bald
spot
under
his
cap
knew
gray
and
came
to
welcome
her
his
girls
were
gone
over
to
newport
to
a
he
said
but
he
insisted
on
taking
gray
and
cannie
in
to
see
their
quarters
which
were
in
a
casemate
in
close
neighborhood
to
one
of
the
great
guns
here
he
brewed
them
a
delicious
cup
of
tea
and
afterward
at
gray
request
he
took
candace
to
see
the
magazines
and
some
of
the
curious
underground
passages
which
connect
one
side
of
the
fort
with
the
other
cannie
thought
these
extremely
interesting
and
like
all
the
caves
on
desert
islands
which
she
had
ever
read
about
for
they
were
narrow
dark
and
mysterious
they
smelt
very
close
and
all
sorts
of
odd
funguses
and
formations
were
growing
on
the
roofs
overhead
these
adventures
chased
the
worry
from
her
mind
and
the
anxious
puckers
from
her
forehead
and
she
went
home
quite
happily
without
recurring
again
to
the
subject
of
their
late
conversation
but
she
did
not
forget
it
and
it
bore
fruit
gray
noted
without
seeming
to
be
on
the
watch
the
efforts
which
candace
thenceforward
made
to
overcome
her
shyness
she
saw
her
force
herself
to
come
forward
force
herself
to
smile
to
speak
when
all
the
time
she
was
quaking
inwardly
and
she
felt
that
there
was
real
power
of
character
required
for
such
an
effort
quiet
candace
would
always
be
modest
and
retiring
it
was
her
nature
to
be
but
gradually
she
learned
not
to
seem
cold
and
stiff
and
when
her
cousin
saw
her
as
she
sometimes
did
forgetting
herself
in
talking
to
some
one
and
lighting
up
into
her
easy
natural
bright
manner
she
felt
that
the
rather
hard
lesson
administered
that
afternoon
on
the
ocean
drive
had
not
been
in
vain
rome
was
not
built
in
a
day
and
ease
of
manner
is
not
acquired
in
a
moment
but
candace
had
at
last
got
hold
of
a
right
idea
and
there
was
hope
that
with
time
people
less
charitable
even
than
perfect
angels
might
pronounce
her
agreeable
chapter
vii
two
picnics
it
was
while
candace
was
still
doing
battle
with
her
shyness
sometimes
getting
the
better
of
it
and
then
again
yielding
and
letting
it
get
the
better
of
her
that
georgie
and
gertrude
sent
out
invitations
to
another
luncheon
party
of
girls
it
was
the
third
they
had
given
since
coming
to
newport
gray
certainly
did
a
great
deal
for
the
pleasure
of
her
daughters
although
berenice
joy
did
consider
her
so
strict
candace
had
her
share
in
this
entertainment
as
one
of
the
three
young
ladies
of
the
house
the
party
was
mainly
composed
of
the
early
dippers
who
were
not
as
formidable
to
her
imagination
as
entire
strangers
would
have
been
she
and
georgie
and
gertrude
wore
their
white
woollen
dresses
which
were
almost
exactly
alike
and
looked
like
triplets
as
marian
rather
spitefully
observed
marian
herself
was
not
asked
to
the
party
and
was
out
of
humor
in
consequence
her
crossness
did
not
extend
to
candace
however
she
evinced
this
by
coming
in
just
as
candace
had
finished
dressing
with
a
pink
rose
in
her
hand
which
she
pinned
on
the
shoulder
of
the
white
gown
just
under
candace
cheek
that
looks
sweet
remarked
marian
i
am
really
quite
pleased
at
your
appearance
you
every
bit
as
pretty
as
gertrude
and
heaps
better
looking
than
that
old
georgie
who
would
let
me
come
to
her
party
now
take
my
advice
hold
your
head
up
and
do
let
any
of
the
girls
bully
you
if
berry
joy
tries
it
sit
down
hard
on
her
i
do
know
how
to
sit
down
hard
laughed
candace
but
she
kissed
marian
for
the
sweet
rose
and
went
downstairs
feeling
quite
brave
marian
watched
her
over
the
balusters
made
a
face
at
berry
joy
who
was
just
sailing
into
the
shook
her
dimpled
fist
at
georgie
back
visible
through
the
open
door
and
then
went
to
sit
with
her
mother
who
also
was
not
invited
there
is
no
prettier
entertainment
than
a
of
girls
the
flowers
the
confections
all
the
graceful
little
fripperies
of
the
feast
seem
to
suit
with
the
bright
young
faces
to
whom
daylight
is
a
becoming
and
not
a
dangerous
test
frederic
had
taken
great
pains
in
ornamenting
the
table
for
his
young
ladies
there
was
a
nosegay
for
each
guest
and
no
two
nosegays
were
alike
one
was
made
up
of
roses
and
daisies
another
of
roses
and
heliotrope
another
of
roses
and
violets
and
each
was
tied
with
a
satin
ribbon
of
corresponding
color
which
had
the
name
of
the
girl
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
the
date
painted
in
gold
letters
on
the
ends
in
the
middle
of
the
table
stood
a
large
square
pan
of
glass
in
which
floated
a
mass
of
waterlilies
pink
and
white
and
winding
in
and
out
among
the
little
dishes
of
crystallized
fruits
√©clairs
apricots
and
grapes
was
a
continuous
curving
wreath
of
pansies
of
every
color
it
appeared
to
lie
directly
on
the
white
tablecloth
but
the
stems
of
the
flowers
were
really
set
in
shallow
of
tin
not
over
half
an
inch
high
which
were
filled
with
wet
sand
for
the
more
substantial
part
of
the
meal
appeared
a
succession
of
appetizing
little
dishes
hot
and
perfectly
served
and
the
of
the
whole
was
of
course
unlimited
and
those
national
delicacies
dear
equally
to
the
heart
of
every
american
girl
the
country
over
whether
she
consumes
her
in
uppermost
maine
or
southernmost
florida
luncheon
over
the
party
went
out
to
the
piazza
where
coffee
was
served
and
then
berry
joy
began
to
tell
of
a
picnic
at
grove
which
she
had
attended
the
day
before
none
of
the
other
girls
had
as
it
happened
been
present
so
she
had
the
field
of
narrative
to
herself
it
was
perfectly
splendid
she
said
there
were
five
coaches
with
four
ladies
and
a
lot
of
men
in
each
and
ever
so
many
other
carriages
we
made
a
sort
of
procession
down
the
island
i
went
in
lawrence
coach
with
sue
tucker
and
maude
and
freddy
you
should
have
seen
the
country
people
rush
out
to
look
at
us
when
all
the
horns
blew
at
once
i
tell
you
it
was
exciting
and
what
did
you
do
after
you
got
to
the
grove
oh
we
had
the
most
wonderful
spread
that
ever
was
seen
you
know
everybody
takes
a
dish
and
a
bottle
of
wine
to
these
picnics
and
there
is
always
a
great
competition
as
to
who
shall
bring
the
best
things
i
never
saw
such
a
luncheon
in
my
life
everything
was
perfectly
delicious
but
what
did
you
do
why
we
did
do
anything
but
that
there
was
no
time
for
anything
else
it
took
ever
so
long
to
get
lunch
ready
some
of
the
things
had
to
be
cooked
after
we
got
there
you
know
and
the
coffee
and
the
mayonnaise
made
the
servants
lit
fires
and
fussed
about
and
the
rest
of
us
sat
round
and
talked
a
little
but
i
was
so
ravenous
that
i
could
think
of
anything
but
lunch
and
i
rather
think
the
others
were
in
the
same
condition
then
as
soon
as
we
had
done
it
was
time
to
start
for
home
what
do
you
think
that
horrid
deane
said
she
continued
after
a
short
pause
you
know
he
always
trying
to
be
satirical
some
one
was
saying
something
about
the
grove
being
such
a
nice
place
for
picnics
and
deane
interrupted
in
that
disagreeable
dry
way
of
his
which
some
people
call
funny
yes
perhaps
so
but
in
my
opinion
the
proper
place
for
a
picnic
of
this
kind
is
a
gorge
there
was
a
universal
giggle
how
did
he
dare
observed
julia
prime
oh
he
dares
to
say
just
what
he
likes
he
does
mind
anybody
but
i
know
one
thing
and
that
is
that
gorham
allerton
did
like
it
a
bit
he
looked
absolutely
black
and
i
saw
him
talking
to
jackson
tainter
about
it
afterward
and
i
wager
something
handsome
that
old
deane
will
find
himself
left
out
of
the
next
picnic
i
sure
if
he
does
it
will
only
serve
him
right
for
being
so
rude
i
do
believe
he
mind
it
if
he
is
invited
remarked
gertrude
he
dined
with
papa
last
night
and
i
heard
him
say
that
it
was
the
dullest
affair
he
ever
was
at
in
his
life
and
only
fit
for
the
of
ulysses
what
he
mean
i
do
know
something
about
general
grant
i
candace
what
you
laughing
at
oh
nothing
said
cannie
composing
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
a
little
old
translation
of
the
odyssey
had
been
among
the
books
in
the
north
tolland
library
and
she
was
more
up
in
the
companions
of
ulysses
than
the
rest
of
the
party
how
different
picnics
are
from
those
which
we
used
to
have
in
newport
when
i
was
a
girl
remarked
gray
from
the
window
where
she
had
been
standing
unperceived
for
a
moment
or
two
oh
gray
are
you
there
and
the
girls
hastened
to
the
window
some
of
them
kissed
her
and
all
except
perhaps
berry
joy
looked
glad
to
see
her
for
she
was
a
general
favorite
with
her
daughters
friends
tell
us
about
the
picnics
you
used
to
have
when
you
were
young
said
julia
prime
balancing
herself
on
the
and
keeping
fast
hold
of
gray
hand
there
is
not
much
to
tell
julia
they
would
seem
tame
affairs
enough
to
you
modern
young
people
i
suppose
we
had
any
men
with
us
as
a
general
thing
except
an
occasional
brother
or
cousin
and
we
carry
half
as
much
to
eat
as
seems
to
be
considered
necessary
then
we
did
all
the
work
ourselves
instead
of
taking
cooks
and
footmen
to
do
it
for
us
but
for
all
that
we
thought
them
most
delightful
for
one
thing
we
always
went
to
some
really
interesting
place
such
as
the
glen
or
the
dumpling
rocks
or
the
paradise
valleys
where
are
the
paradise
valleys
inquired
julia
oh
i
know
what
they
are
said
maud
hallett
they
are
lovely
places
hidden
in
behind
bishop
berkeley
rock
i
went
there
once
with
aunt
edith
she
knows
all
the
nooks
and
corners
of
newport
better
than
anybody
else
mamma
you
must
take
us
there
some
day
said
georgie
oh
do
and
let
me
go
with
you
pleaded
maud
i
should
like
so
much
to
see
them
again
wo
you
take
me
too
said
belle
jeffrys
we
should
all
like
to
go
remarked
julia
slyly
oh
gray
dear
i
have
such
a
lovely
idea
give
us
a
picnic
yourself
one
of
the
nice
sort
that
you
used
to
have
when
you
were
young
in
the
paradise
valley
wo
you
dear
gray
oh
do
you
need
coax
so
hard
julia
i
very
easy
to
persuade
when
i
like
to
do
a
thing
said
gray
with
a
laugh
i
give
you
a
picnic
with
pleasure
only
i
must
make
one
stipulation
that
it
shall
be
exclusively
a
i
do
think
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
would
enjoy
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
or
know
what
to
make
of
it
girls
cried
julia
just
listen
to
what
this
dear
angel
says
going
to
take
us
to
paradise
valley
all
by
ourselves
with
no
men
to
bother
and
distract
our
men
out
of
place
in
paradise
anyway
just
think
how
adam
behaved
this
in
a
parenthesis
it
is
to
be
a
real
goloptious
picnic
now
who
would
like
to
go
besides
myself
i
i
i
cried
the
girls
with
gratifying
unanimity
now
what
day
shall
it
be
continued
julia
let
make
gray
settle
the
time
at
once
and
then
she
ca
back
out
i
do
want
to
back
out
said
gray
i
enjoy
the
idea
as
much
as
you
do
so
after
some
comparing
of
engagements
the
next
thursday
was
fixed
upon
you
had
better
make
this
the
rendezvous
said
the
giver
of
the
picnic
i
shall
have
room
for
one
girl
in
my
wagonette
besides
my
four
you
must
all
wear
something
stout
which
wo
spoil
with
scrambling
over
rocks
and
you
need
not
bring
any
i
will
see
to
all
that
this
is
to
be
an
picnic
you
know
and
i
shall
provide
exactly
the
sort
of
things
that
we
used
to
take
i
was
young
and
charming
many
years
ago
you
are
just
as
charming
as
you
can
be
now
declared
belle
enthusiastically
i
do
hope
there
wo
be
a
fog
said
julia
prime
as
she
walked
up
the
avenue
with
the
others
i
care
if
there
is
replied
berry
i
must
say
it
sounds
to
me
like
a
very
stupid
plan
no
men
and
nothing
in
particular
to
eat
just
like
gray
her
ideas
are
so
queer
as
mamma
says
i
wonder
you
go
if
you
feel
that
way
about
it
retorted
julia
i
dare
say
i
i
have
a
strong
presentiment
that
on
that
particular
day
i
shall
have
a
headache
and
berry
did
a
distracting
headache
as
she
wrote
georgie
she
was
the
only
member
of
the
early
dip
club
who
missed
the
picnic
headaches
are
sad
but
convenient
things
eleven
brought
the
girls
to
the
grays
front
door
all
ready
for
their
start
in
various
village
carts
and
victorias
there
was
a
little
georgie
and
gertrude
fitted
in
with
some
of
their
cronies
and
gray
took
three
girls
besides
marian
and
candace
in
her
wagonette
frederic
and
the
coachman
stowed
many
small
baskets
and
a
heap
of
wraps
into
the
different
rumbles
and
box
seats
and
they
set
forth
under
the
bluest
of
blue
skies
it
was
a
beautiful
day
just
warm
enough
and
not
too
warm
for
a
fragrant
wind
was
blowing
softly
in
from
the
sea
they
had
passed
the
first
beach
which
at
that
hour
was
black
with
bathers
and
and
had
climbed
the
which
separates
it
from
the
second
beach
when
marian
suddenly
cried
mamma
here
we
are
close
to
purgatory
ca
we
stop
just
a
minute
and
show
it
to
candace
gray
looked
at
her
watch
your
minute
will
be
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
marian
she
said
but
i
think
there
is
time
enough
would
any
of
the
rest
of
you
like
to
go
girls
always
want
to
go
there
was
a
general
disembarkation
and
gray
led
the
way
through
a
gate
and
across
a
rough
field
which
stretched
along
the
top
of
a
line
of
cliffs
steeper
and
bolder
than
those
on
the
newport
point
and
cut
here
and
there
into
sudden
sharp
fissures
the
scanty
grass
yellow
with
august
sun
was
broken
everywhere
by
lumps
and
boulders
of
that
odd
conglomerate
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
stone
and
the
early
blue
aster
were
flowering
everywhere
a
flock
of
sheep
fled
at
their
approach
with
a
low
rushing
sound
like
the
wind
in
boughs
illustration
purgatory
the
name
of
purgatory
seemed
to
her
to
suggest
some
terrible
sort
of
page
candace
walked
along
with
the
rest
in
a
little
shiver
of
expectancy
the
name
of
purgatory
seemed
to
her
to
suggest
some
terrible
sort
of
place
presently
she
saw
the
girls
ahead
as
they
reached
a
particular
point
diverge
sharply
to
the
right
with
little
cries
and
exclamations
and
when
she
advanced
she
found
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
chasm
deeper
and
darker
than
any
of
those
which
they
had
passed
it
cut
the
cliff
from
its
highest
point
to
the
and
the
sides
receded
toward
their
base
leaving
vaulted
hollows
beneath
into
which
the
eye
could
not
penetrate
only
the
ear
caught
the
sound
of
thunderous
murmurs
and
strange
gurgles
and
hisses
of
spray
echoing
from
unseen
recesses
far
underground
and
it
was
easy
to
imagine
that
these
sounds
came
from
some
imprisoned
hemmed
in
by
the
tide
with
no
chance
of
escape
and
vexing
the
air
with
its
groans
candace
shrank
away
from
the
brink
with
a
sensation
of
affright
what
an
awful
place
she
said
drawing
a
long
breath
do
you
suppose
any
one
ever
fell
down
there
every
member
of
the
party
had
some
tradition
of
the
sort
to
relate
but
none
of
the
stories
seemed
to
rest
on
a
very
secure
foundation
anybody
who
did
must
be
killed
i
should
think
i
do
wonder
they
named
it
purgatory
said
marian
there
was
a
fascination
of
horror
about
the
spot
the
girls
lingered
and
leaned
over
the
brink
and
turned
back
until
gray
had
to
call
them
away
and
they
were
all
rather
silent
as
they
walked
across
the
field
to
their
carriages
but
the
impression
was
soon
dispelled
for
as
they
drove
down
the
incline
toward
the
second
beach
they
came
upon
an
unexpected
scene
of
brilliant
and
animated
life
the
tide
and
the
wind
together
were
bringing
ashore
quantities
of
seaweed
of
the
kind
used
in
manuring
fields
and
all
the
farmers
of
the
neighborhood
had
assembled
to
secure
this
harvest
the
long
curves
of
yellow
sands
which
stretch
from
the
purgatory
rocks
to
sacluest
point
were
alive
with
people
teams
of
mild
or
white
oxen
stood
harnessed
to
heavy
wagons
ready
to
drag
the
seaweed
home
out
in
the
plunging
surf
men
were
urging
horses
seaward
or
swimming
them
toward
the
shore
with
long
implements
in
their
wake
which
gathered
and
bore
along
masses
of
the
glittering
brown
and
rosy
kelp
the
splash
and
foam
of
the
waves
the
rearing
horses
the
cries
of
the
men
and
of
the
seagulls
who
seemed
to
resent
this
intrusion
upon
their
haunts
made
a
vivid
and
fascinating
picture
which
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
beauty
of
sea
and
sky
and
the
freshness
of
the
wind
then
passing
the
beach
the
carriages
drove
along
a
smooth
country
road
for
a
short
distance
and
turned
into
a
narrow
lane
running
up
hill
which
presently
brought
them
to
a
small
built
on
the
very
edge
of
a
ravine
here
we
take
to
our
feet
said
gray
jumping
out
of
the
wagonette
the
farmer
and
his
wife
who
seemed
to
be
old
acquaintances
came
out
to
speak
to
her
the
baskets
were
collected
and
the
carriages
sent
back
to
town
with
orders
to
return
to
the
same
place
at
six
oh
why
six
why
not
stay
and
go
home
by
moonlight
urged
julia
my
dear
child
if
you
were
in
the
habit
of
reading
either
the
almanac
or
the
heavens
you
would
know
that
there
will
be
no
moon
till
after
eleven
said
her
chaperone
these
roads
will
be
as
black
as
pitch
by
seven
now
girls
each
of
you
take
your
own
shawl
and
one
of
the
baskets
and
we
will
into
paradise
it
sounds
paradoxical
but
you
shall
see
she
led
the
way
down
a
steep
narrow
pathway
on
the
into
the
valley
below
the
path
was
overhung
with
trees
it
was
necessary
to
put
the
boughs
aside
here
and
there
brambles
reached
from
the
thicket
to
catch
at
the
girls
skirts
as
they
went
by
but
when
they
had
passed
these
trifling
obstacles
they
found
themselves
safely
on
the
level
floor
of
a
little
valley
below
such
a
choice
little
valley
it
was
enclosed
between
the
line
of
hill
from
which
they
had
just
descended
and
another
parallel
line
whose
top
was
of
solid
granite
and
whose
base
was
walled
by
trees
this
double
barrier
kept
off
all
cold
winds
and
let
the
sunshine
in
from
east
to
west
to
flood
and
foster
the
valley
growths
to
the
east
the
eye
saw
only
the
winding
of
the
leafy
glade
the
west
stood
open
to
the
sea
and
gave
a
wide
vista
of
glittering
ocean
and
yellow
beach
the
ground
was
carpeted
with
the
softest
grass
thickets
of
wild
roses
showed
here
and
there
a
late
blossom
and
other
thickets
of
alders
glittered
with
berries
loaded
with
small
crimson
apples
made
spots
of
color
on
the
grew
thickly
in
damp
spots
and
mosses
clustered
among
the
stones
birds
chirped
and
flew
from
every
bush
and
tree
all
was
shaded
and
peaceful
and
still
newport
with
its
whirl
and
glitter
seemed
immeasurably
far
away
the
paradise
valley
might
to
all
appearance
have
been
hidden
in
the
heart
of
the
alleghanies
instead
of
being
within
three
miles
of
the
gayest
in
america
gray
with
accustomed
feet
led
the
way
straight
across
the
glade
to
where
an
old
stood
commanding
the
oceanward
view
with
a
square
block
of
stone
at
its
foot
this
is
where
we
used
always
to
come
she
said
in
a
dreamy
voice
what
a
delicious
place
cried
julia
to
think
that
i
should
have
spent
seven
summers
in
newport
and
never
have
seen
it
before
what
shall
we
do
with
the
baskets
gray
dear
put
them
here
in
the
shade
and
when
you
all
feel
hungry
we
will
open
them
hungry
why
i
am
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
at
this
moment
i
have
a
gift
at
being
ravenous
girls
what
do
you
say
do
you
agree
with
me
that
no
time
is
like
the
present
time
for
lunch
hold
up
your
hands
if
you
do
very
well
said
gray
laughing
as
every
hand
flew
up
we
will
have
lunch
at
once
then
but
i
warn
you
that
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
done
first
there
pointing
to
a
blackened
spot
against
a
rock
is
where
we
always
boiled
our
kettle
if
some
of
you
will
collect
some
dry
sticks
we
will
see
if
the
present
generation
is
capable
of
making
a
fire
i
meanwhile
will
fetch
the
water
she
took
a
bright
little
copper
kettle
from
one
of
the
baskets
and
mounted
the
hill
with
elastic
footsteps
calling
out
as
she
went
make
haste
and
be
sure
that
the
sticks
are
dry
i
not
sure
that
i
know
a
dry
stick
when
i
see
it
whispered
maud
hallett
to
julia
but
instinct
as
often
happens
took
the
place
of
experience
on
this
occasion
and
gray
found
quite
a
respectable
pile
of
fuel
awaiting
her
when
she
came
back
with
her
kettle
full
of
spring
water
now
i
will
show
you
how
to
swing
a
pot
over
the
fire
she
said
and
in
three
minutes
a
rustic
crane
of
boughs
was
constructed
the
kettle
was
hanging
from
it
and
the
wood
piled
artistically
underneath
a
box
of
matches
appeared
from
gray
pocket
which
as
marian
said
was
every
bit
as
good
as
the
bag
of
the
mother
in
the
swiss
family
robinson
and
seemed
to
hold
almost
as
great
a
variety
of
useful
things
presently
a
gay
little
fire
was
crackling
and
snapping
against
the
face
of
the
rock
and
adding
its
smoke
to
the
blackened
stains
left
by
those
other
smokes
of
long
ago
the
girls
stood
about
watching
the
blaze
and
listening
for
the
first
hiss
of
the
kettle
but
gray
informed
them
that
there
was
still
work
to
be
done
i
want
some
new
potatoes
to
roast
for
one
thing
she
said
maud
and
georgie
you
might
run
up
to
the
farm
and
ask
bacon
to
send
me
a
few
say
eighteen
or
twenty
large
ones
oh
and
a
couple
of
dozen
fresh
eggs
while
they
were
absent
on
this
errand
the
other
girls
under
gray
direction
unpacked
the
baskets
and
arranged
their
contents
on
the
rock
beneath
the
gray
had
taken
pains
to
provide
as
far
as
was
possible
the
same
sort
of
food
which
years
before
it
had
been
customary
to
take
to
picnics
out
of
one
basket
came
a
and
napkins
out
of
another
a
a
loaf
of
brown
bread
and
a
couple
of
pats
of
delicious
darlington
butter
a
third
basket
revealed
a
large
loaf
of
election
cake
with
a
thick
sugary
frosting
a
fourth
was
full
of
crisp
little
jumbles
made
after
an
old
family
recipe
and
warranted
to
melt
in
the
mouth
there
was
a
pile
of
thin
beautifully
cut
sandwiches
plenty
of
rolls
and
a
cold
fowl
ready
carved
into
portions
by
the
time
that
these
provisions
were
unpacked
maud
and
georgie
were
seen
descending
the
hill
at
a
rapid
walk
which
at
sight
of
the
festive
preparations
below
changed
to
what
julia
prime
called
a
hungry
gallop
by
this
time
exercise
and
fresh
air
had
made
everybody
so
desperately
hungry
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
wait
another
moment
so
while
gray
heated
the
coffee
and
dropped
the
large
pink
potatoes
into
their
bed
of
embers
to
roast
the
younger
members
of
the
party
fell
to
work
on
the
sandwiches
just
to
take
off
the
fine
edge
of
their
appetites
till
something
better
was
ready
when
the
coffee
was
hot
gray
seated
herself
by
the
rock
lit
the
lamp
under
her
dropped
in
a
bit
of
butter
sprinkled
with
pepper
and
salt
and
proceeded
to
scramble
a
great
dish
of
eggs
did
any
of
you
ever
eat
hot
scrambled
eggs
under
a
tree
when
you
were
furiously
hungry
if
not
you
can
form
no
idea
of
the
pleasure
which
the
early
dippers
took
in
theirs
but
it
was
not
the
eggs
only
it
was
everything
never
was
a
luncheon
so
delicious
the
girls
protested
new
potatoes
roasted
in
the
ashes
were
a
feast
for
the
gods
and
as
for
the
grandmother
cake
with
which
the
repast
wound
up
it
baffled
analysis
and
description
gray
had
made
this
cake
with
her
own
hands
in
order
to
carry
out
the
historic
verities
as
she
said
it
used
to
be
part
of
the
religion
of
new
england
especially
of
connecticut
she
explained
and
she
told
them
how
once
when
she
was
a
girl
making
a
visit
to
an
old
aunt
in
wethersfield
she
had
sat
up
nearly
all
night
over
a
raising
of
election
cake
but
why
did
you
do
that
asked
the
girls
well
you
see
my
aunt
had
a
sudden
attack
of
rheumatism
in
her
arm
she
was
going
to
have
the
meet
at
her
house
and
such
a
thing
as
a
without
election
cake
was
not
to
be
dreamed
of
so
i
offered
to
make
it
and
i
was
bound
that
it
should
be
good
the
peculiarity
of
this
particular
cake
is
that
it
must
rise
twice
before
it
is
baked
you
mix
half
the
butter
and
sugar
and
so
on
with
the
yeast
and
when
that
is
light
you
put
in
the
other
half
now
my
first
half
refused
to
rise
what
did
you
do
oh
i
sat
beside
it
with
one
of
scott
novels
and
i
waited
it
was
rather
poky
for
my
aunt
and
her
servant
had
gone
to
bed
and
there
were
queer
creaks
and
noises
now
and
then
as
there
always
are
in
old
houses
midnight
struck
and
one
and
two
before
the
first
bubbles
appeared
on
the
surface
of
the
cake
and
i
had
fallen
asleep
over
my
book
more
than
once
before
i
could
be
quite
sure
that
it
was
safe
to
stir
in
the
remainder
of
the
spice
and
fruit
and
go
to
bed
it
was
just
four
when
i
finally
put
out
my
lamp
and
very
sleepy
i
was
next
day
as
you
may
imagine
but
the
cake
turned
out
a
great
success
and
i
had
many
compliments
about
it
from
the
crack
housekeepers
in
the
neighborhood
when
they
found
that
it
was
of
my
making
was
it
a
dreadful
trouble
to
have
to
make
cake
and
things
like
that
at
home
asked
maud
hallett
i
think
i
would
rather
have
had
it
not
quite
so
good
and
got
it
from
the
confectioner
than
to
have
all
that
fuss
and
bother
my
dear
there
no
confectioners
in
those
days
except
in
two
or
three
of
the
largest
cities
and
none
even
then
who
would
be
thought
worth
speaking
of
in
our
time
it
was
a
case
of
cake
or
none
and
though
it
was
certainly
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
cake
was
better
than
any
confectioner
cake
that
i
ever
tasted
people
took
great
pride
in
it
and
recipes
were
copied
and
handed
about
and
talked
over
with
an
interest
which
would
be
impossible
when
everything
comes
to
hand
ready
made
and
you
can
order
a
loaf
of
sponge
cake
by
postal
card
and
have
it
appear
in
a
few
hours
sent
by
express
from
central
new
york
as
some
of
us
have
been
doing
this
summer
the
last
crumb
of
the
grandmother
loaf
had
now
disappeared
and
gray
proposed
that
the
girls
should
go
for
a
scramble
on
the
hills
while
she
repacked
the
baskets
but
this
division
of
labor
was
not
permitted
the
girls
insisted
that
they
must
be
allowed
to
stay
and
help
and
that
the
scramble
would
be
no
fun
at
all
without
their
matron
julia
seized
the
and
and
ran
up
the
hill
to
rinse
them
at
the
spring
the
others
collected
forks
and
plates
and
many
hands
making
light
work
in
a
very
short
while
all
was
in
order
and
gray
in
readiness
to
head
the
walking
party
she
guided
them
to
the
top
of
the
granite
ridge
which
is
visible
from
newport
and
made
them
observe
the
peculiarity
of
the
rock
lines
and
the
contrast
between
their
bareness
and
the
fertility
of
the
little
intervening
glades
for
which
they
serve
as
a
natural
conservatory
then
they
dipped
down
into
the
thickets
of
the
farther
side
finding
all
manner
of
ferns
and
and
shy
growing
things
and
so
to
the
sandy
flats
above
the
third
beach
with
their
outlook
across
the
strait
to
little
compton
and
up
the
curving
shore
of
newport
island
set
with
old
and
solemn
orchards
of
gnarled
from
thence
a
short
walk
brought
them
to
the
end
of
the
ridge
and
to
bishop
berkeley
seat
with
its
ponderous
projecting
roof
of
rocks
and
they
all
sat
down
to
rest
just
where
he
is
said
to
have
sat
with
his
books
and
pen
looking
off
toward
far
bermuda
and
dreaming
of
the
star
of
empire
at
that
time
no
ugly
brick
chimneys
or
artificial
existed
to
mar
the
foreground
and
nothing
sweeter
or
more
peaceful
could
be
imagined
than
the
view
from
the
rocky
shelf
the
breadth
of
ocean
lit
with
clear
sun
the
shining
capes
to
right
and
left
the
yellow
and
winding
creek
bordered
with
brown
grasses
and
patches
of
mallow
or
green
rushes
and
over
all
the
arch
of
blue
summer
sky
one
or
two
carriages
rolled
along
the
distant
road
as
they
sat
there
but
otherwise
the
stillness
was
unbroken
save
by
the
twitter
of
birds
in
the
woods
behind
them
the
chirp
of
or
the
scream
of
gulls
on
the
beach
and
the
soft
intermittent
boom
of
the
surf
it
had
been
a
perfect
afternoon
and
a
great
success
all
the
picnickers
voted
as
they
parted
in
the
dusk
on
the
in
front
of
gray
door
yet
after
all
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
newport
and
civilization
and
they
were
not
sorry
to
come
back
to
them
it
was
all
very
well
to
play
at
being
for
a
day
but
modern
times
have
their
distinct
charms
and
conveniences
and
if
the
girls
on
sober
preferred
their
own
share
of
the
centuries
to
any
other
no
one
need
count
them
blameworthy
chapter
viii
one
afternoon
in
august
candace
happened
to
be
alone
in
the
with
gray
when
joy
was
announced
my
dear
began
that
lady
after
administering
the
two
hard
rapid
little
kisses
which
were
her
idea
of
a
cordial
greeting
i
come
to
see
if
you
do
want
to
go
down
to
the
point
with
me
there
an
old
woman
there
i
hear
who
has
a
lot
of
wonderful
old
china
and
some
mahogany
which
she
wants
to
sell
and
i
going
to
look
at
them
do
put
your
things
on
and
come
i
hate
to
drive
alone
and
there
no
fun
in
this
sort
of
expedition
unless
there
some
one
along
with
you
you
are
very
kind
said
gray
but
i
have
promised
gray
to
go
with
him
at
four
to
call
on
some
friends
who
have
just
arrived
at
bateman
so
it
quite
impossible
for
me
to
go
with
you
who
is
the
old
woman
do
you
recollect
her
name
oh
collishan
or
collisham
some
name
like
that
she
lives
in
third
street
it
must
be
old
miss
colishaw
are
you
sure
she
wants
to
sell
her
china
asked
gray
who
as
a
child
had
spent
many
summers
in
newport
before
it
became
a
fashionable
and
knew
the
townspeople
much
better
than
did
joy
i
believe
so
why
should
she
she
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
they
tell
me
and
what
use
can
such
things
be
to
her
she
would
rather
have
the
money
of
course
you
ca
go
then
i
awfully
sorry
but
let
me
have
one
of
the
girls
dear
wo
you
i
absolutely
ca
do
it
alone
georgie
has
gone
to
drive
with
berry
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
gertrude
is
on
the
sofa
with
a
headache
well
here
miss
candace
she
has
a
headache
i
sure
perhaps
she
will
take
pity
on
you
come
wo
you
that
a
dear
run
and
put
on
your
hat
it
a
splendid
afternoon
and
the
point
a
very
interesting
place
if
you
happen
to
like
old
things
i
do
care
for
them
myself
but
they
all
the
fashion
now
you
know
and
i
dare
say
you
caught
the
fever
with
the
rest
of
the
she
can
come
she
dear
mrs
gray
i
do
think
she
has
any
engagement
replied
gray
trying
not
to
smile
at
the
struggle
with
dismay
that
was
going
on
in
countenance
she
likes
driving
and
it
is
a
beautiful
you
can
go
ca
you
cannie
it
was
impossible
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
frame
any
excuse
joy
eyes
were
full
upon
her
cousin
kate
gave
no
help
there
seemed
nothing
to
do
but
to
comply
candace
murmured
something
about
certainly
very
kind
very
happy
and
went
away
to
put
on
the
red
hat
which
went
very
well
with
the
dress
of
red
and
white
linen
that
she
happened
to
have
on
it
was
a
new
one
which
gray
had
bought
for
warm
days
and
which
elizabeth
had
fitted
and
made
she
wore
a
red
rose
in
her
breast
and
had
a
pair
of
gray
gloves
and
she
looked
very
fresh
and
girlish
in
this
simple
costume
but
joy
did
not
quite
approve
of
it
why
do
they
fix
the
little
thing
up
better
she
was
thinking
to
herself
as
she
got
into
the
carriage
it
too
bad
she
be
quite
if
she
were
a
little
more
stylish
a
light
silk
now
or
a
surah
in
two
shades
like
berry
blue
would
make
quite
a
different
thing
of
her
you
been
down
on
the
point
before
now
i
suppose
she
said
as
they
rolled
smoothly
along
the
avenue
yes
once
i
did
cousin
kate
took
me
with
her
one
day
to
call
on
a
friend
of
hers
miss
gisborne
oh
yes
that
queer
old
maid
i
know
they
very
intimate
though
i
confess
i
never
could
see
what
gray
finds
in
her
to
like
she
so
eccentric
and
so
different
from
other
people
and
she
wears
such
extraordinary
clothes
but
she
very
nice
and
she
tells
the
funniest
stories
and
her
house
is
ever
so
pretty
said
candace
rather
at
a
loss
to
know
what
she
ought
to
say
ah
indeed
is
it
inside
you
mean
i
do
think
it
amounts
to
much
outside
though
people
who
have
a
mania
for
old
houses
rave
about
it
i
believe
i
afraid
i
dreadfully
modern
in
my
tastes
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
see
any
beauty
in
ceilings
so
low
that
you
bump
your
head
against
them
and
little
scraps
of
windows
filled
with
greenish
glass
that
you
ca
see
through
and
which
make
you
look
like
a
mouldy
fright
if
any
one
looks
through
from
the
outside
miss
gisborne
green
admitted
candace
some
of
them
are
so
old
that
they
have
colors
all
over
them
like
red
and
blue
and
yellow
i
liked
to
see
them
and
she
told
us
that
last
summer
an
architect
who
was
going
by
the
house
stopped
and
looked
at
them
a
long
time
and
then
rang
the
bell
and
offered
to
give
her
new
sashes
with
great
big
panes
in
them
if
she
would
exchange
but
she
would
the
more
fool
she
rejoined
joy
frankly
my
what
a
splendid
big
house
that
is
going
to
be
that
the
kind
of
thing
i
like
and
she
pointed
to
an
enormous
structure
of
wood
painted
pumpkin
color
and
vermilion
which
with
its
size
its
details
and
the
many
high
thin
chimneys
which
rose
above
its
towering
roofs
looked
a
happy
mixture
of
an
asylum
a
factory
and
a
swiss
ch√¢let
but
what
a
little
bit
of
ground
there
is
about
it
for
such
a
big
house
said
candace
whose
country
eyes
were
often
struck
by
the
disproportion
between
the
newport
edifices
and
the
land
on
which
they
stood
yes
land
is
so
dreadfully
dear
now
that
people
ca
afford
large
places
i
wonder
why
this
is
called
street
said
candace
looking
at
the
name
painted
on
the
corner
of
a
street
into
which
they
were
turning
some
people
say
it
because
this
is
the
street
by
which
funerals
come
away
from
the
cemetery
replied
joy
there
the
down
there
you
seen
that
i
suppose
gray
comes
down
to
the
mothers
meetings
sometimes
i
know
yes
and
she
has
promised
to
take
me
with
her
some
day
but
we
gone
yet
the
carriage
now
turned
into
a
narrow
street
parallel
with
the
bay
but
not
in
sight
of
it
and
joy
indicated
to
her
footman
a
low
house
shabby
with
and
lack
of
paint
whose
only
ornament
was
a
large
and
resplendent
brass
knocker
on
its
front
door
that
the
place
she
said
just
look
at
that
knocker
i
know
for
a
certainty
that
lots
of
people
have
offered
to
buy
it
and
the
absurd
old
creature
to
whom
it
belongs
wo
sell
she
declares
that
it
been
there
ever
since
she
can
remember
and
that
it
shall
stay
there
as
long
as
she
stays
so
ridiculous
when
things
of
the
kind
bring
such
an
enormous
price
now
and
she
really
needs
the
money
the
carriage
now
stopped
joy
got
out
and
candace
with
her
the
footman
seized
the
shining
knocker
and
gave
a
loud
rap
go
back
to
the
carriage
wilkins
said
joy
then
she
added
in
a
low
voice
to
candace
get
close
to
the
door
dear
these
people
are
so
queer
i
often
have
to
push
my
way
in
but
i
can
always
manage
them
in
the
end
the
door
was
opened
a
very
little
way
by
a
very
little
girl
is
miss
collisham
at
home
asked
joy
at
the
same
time
inserting
her
foot
deftly
between
the
door
and
the
to
insure
that
the
door
should
not
be
closed
against
her
no
said
the
child
she
gone
out
dear
me
what
a
shame
where
is
she
demanded
the
visitor
in
an
aggrieved
tone
as
if
miss
colishaw
had
no
right
to
be
out
when
wanted
by
the
owner
of
such
a
fine
equipage
she
over
to
old
miss
barnes
she
sick
replied
the
little
girl
who
sick
old
miss
barnes
and
where
does
she
live
just
over
there
in
first
street
said
the
child
staring
at
candace
whose
big
red
hat
had
caught
her
fancy
but
a
little
way
she
added
ah
indeed
said
joy
pushing
her
way
into
the
entry
well
then
you
just
run
over
to
this
place
dear
and
tell
miss
collisham
that
there
a
lady
waiting
to
speak
to
her
on
business
be
quick
that
a
good
little
girl
this
young
lady
and
i
will
sit
down
here
and
wait
till
you
come
back
the
small
maiden
looked
uncertain
and
rather
frightened
but
joy
marched
resolutely
into
the
little
parlor
on
one
side
of
the
hall
and
seated
herself
so
after
a
pause
of
hesitation
the
child
seized
a
which
lay
on
a
chair
and
set
off
at
a
run
in
the
direction
indicated
the
moment
she
was
gone
joy
jumped
briskly
up
such
a
piece
of
good
luck
she
cried
one
so
rarely
gets
the
chance
to
examine
a
place
like
this
without
the
bother
of
a
family
standing
by
to
watch
everything
you
do
then
to
candace
horror
and
astonishment
she
walked
straight
across
the
room
to
a
cupboard
which
her
experienced
eye
had
detected
in
the
side
of
the
chimney
opened
the
door
and
took
a
survey
of
the
contents
nothing
there
she
remarked
locking
it
up
only
medicine
bottles
and
trash
let
try
again
she
opened
a
closet
door
and
emitted
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
these
must
be
the
very
plates
i
heard
of
she
said
let
me
see
five
six
eight
a
complete
dozen
i
declare
and
all
in
good
order
and
a
platter
and
two
dishes
well
this
a
find
and
such
lovely
china
too
i
must
have
it
kinglake
that
she
so
proud
of
is
half
so
handsome
and
has
only
eight
plates
now
where
are
those
chairs
that
they
told
me
about
i
wonder
candace
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
very
chairs
as
it
proved
the
other
joy
presently
discovered
in
a
little
which
opened
from
the
parlor
and
which
she
lost
no
time
in
rummaging
she
had
just
unlocked
another
closet
door
and
was
standing
before
it
with
a
pitcher
in
her
hand
when
the
mistress
of
the
house
appeared
a
tall
thin
rather
woman
whose
cheeks
still
wore
the
fresh
color
which
cheeks
retain
till
old
age
in
the
narragansett
country
candace
who
had
remained
in
her
chair
in
a
state
of
speechless
and
helpless
dismay
watching
joy
proceedings
through
the
open
door
saw
her
coming
but
had
no
time
to
warn
joy
you
wanted
to
see
me
on
business
said
miss
colishaw
fixing
a
pair
of
wrathful
eyes
on
joy
the
pitcher
and
the
open
door
of
the
closet
oh
is
it
miss
collisham
replied
that
lady
neither
noticing
nor
caring
for
the
very
evident
indignation
of
look
and
tone
your
little
girl
was
so
kind
as
to
say
that
she
would
go
and
call
you
and
while
we
were
waiting
we
thought
we
would
look
at
this
curious
old
we
are
there
more
of
you
then
demanded
miss
colishaw
glaring
into
the
closet
as
if
she
expected
to
see
other
audacious
visitors
concealed
in
its
depths
finding
none
she
closed
the
door
and
turned
its
stout
wooden
button
with
a
good
deal
of
energy
if
you
any
business
with
me
she
said
perhaps
you
be
so
kind
as
to
step
into
the
parlor
and
say
what
it
is
certainly
responded
joy
airily
but
before
we
go
do
tell
me
about
this
curious
old
jug
it
spode
is
it
not
i
almost
sure
that
it
must
be
spode
or
some
other
of
the
very
old
english
wares
do
you
know
about
it
i
know
that
it
was
my
mother
and
that
all
that
i
care
to
know
replied
miss
colishaw
grimly
taking
it
out
of
her
hand
i
use
it
to
keep
corks
in
corks
how
amusing
but
it
really
a
nice
old
piece
you
know
like
to
buy
it
if
you
do
care
any
more
for
it
than
that
you
could
put
your
corks
in
something
else
just
as
well
it
ai
for
sale
said
miss
colishaw
decidedly
putting
the
pitcher
again
into
the
closet
and
leading
the
way
into
the
parlor
candace
who
had
heard
all
and
was
feeling
awkward
and
guilty
to
the
last
degree
rose
as
they
entered
and
courtesied
to
miss
colishaw
perhaps
her
face
showed
something
of
the
shame
and
annoyance
with
which
her
heart
was
filled
for
miss
colishaw
iron
expression
relaxed
a
little
and
the
she
vouchsafed
her
sounded
a
shade
less
implacable
oh
i
forgot
said
joy
turning
back
to
the
rear
room
this
old
chair
miss
collisham
my
name
interposed
her
hostess
i
beg
your
pardon
i
sure
so
it
is
of
course
well
as
i
was
saying
i
noticed
a
delightful
old
in
this
room
ah
there
it
is
it
exactly
matches
some
without
arms
which
i
bought
at
sypher
if
you
like
to
part
with
this
and
the
other
in
the
front
room
miss
miss
collishall
i
should
be
glad
to
buy
them
and
i
give
you
a
very
good
price
for
them
because
of
the
match
miss
colishaw
made
no
answer
then
there
some
china
that
i
in
another
closet
went
on
joy
returning
again
to
the
parlor
and
opening
the
door
of
the
closet
in
question
this
red
and
blue
i
mean
i
see
you
have
a
good
deal
of
it
and
it
a
kind
i
particularly
fancy
it
like
some
which
my
dear
old
grandmother
used
to
have
joy
tone
became
quite
sentimental
i
give
almost
anything
for
it
for
the
sake
of
old
associations
i
wish
you
fix
a
price
on
this
miss
collisham
very
well
then
i
will
one
million
of
dollars
replied
miss
colishaw
losing
all
command
over
her
temper
no
i
not
joking
one
million
of
dollars
not
a
cent
less
and
not
even
that
would
pay
me
for
my
mother
china
and
the
chair
my
father
used
to
sit
in
when
he
was
old
they
ai
for
sale
and
when
i
said
that
once
i
said
it
for
always
but
my
dear
miss
collishall
i
ai
your
dear
and
my
name
ai
collishall
colishaw
what
called
and
it
a
good
old
newport
name
though
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
remember
it
i
beg
your
pardon
said
joy
loftily
it
rather
an
unusual
name
and
i
never
happened
to
hear
it
till
then
you
do
care
to
sell
any
of
these
old
things
no
not
one
thing
well
i
must
say
that
i
consider
you
very
foolish
this
sort
of
old
stuff
wo
always
be
the
fashion
and
the
minute
the
fashion
goes
out
they
wo
be
worth
anything
nobody
will
want
to
buy
them
they
be
worth
just
the
same
to
then
that
they
are
now
responded
miss
colishaw
more
gently
she
evidently
saw
the
hopelessness
of
trying
to
impress
her
point
of
view
on
joy
i
dare
say
you
have
an
of
delightful
old
and
things
remarked
that
lady
quick
to
mark
the
change
of
tone
and
hoping
to
profit
by
it
she
glanced
toward
the
as
she
spoke
miss
colishaw
quickly
stepped
in
front
of
the
stairs
and
stood
there
with
the
air
of
an
ancient
roman
defending
his
household
gods
yes
i
an
attic
she
said
dryly
it
a
very
good
attic
and
it
stuffed
full
of
old
things
there
a
fender
and
two
pairs
of
joy
eyes
sparkled
oh
do
let
us
go
up
and
see
it
she
cried
no
you
do
said
miss
colishaw
taking
a
firmer
grasp
of
the
baluster
there
a
and
a
and
a
winder
and
three
dear
me
what
a
delightful
place
put
in
joy
there
lots
and
lots
of
old
truck
continued
the
implacable
miss
colishaw
it
all
belonged
to
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
and
her
mother
before
her
it
all
up
there
and
there
it
going
to
stay
if
all
the
rich
ladies
in
newport
come
down
to
try
to
wheedle
me
out
of
it
not
a
soul
of
them
shall
set
foot
in
my
attic
well
i
must
say
that
i
think
you
very
foolish
said
joy
settling
the
wrists
of
her
long
gloves
you
very
poor
and
these
old
things
are
no
use
to
you
in
the
way
you
live
and
you
far
better
take
the
money
they
would
bring
and
make
yourself
comfortable
miss
colishaw
was
now
pale
with
anger
and
who
told
you
i
was
poor
she
demanded
did
i
ever
come
to
you
did
i
ever
walk
into
your
house
to
pry
and
rummage
and
tell
you
that
your
things
were
no
use
when
i
do
you
have
a
right
to
come
here
and
behave
as
you
have
but
not
a
minute
before
use
they
of
use
they
remind
me
of
my
family
of
the
time
i
was
young
when
we
all
lived
in
this
house
together
before
newport
grew
to
be
a
fashionable
and
was
spoiled
for
people
of
the
old
sort
if
all
the
business
you
have
with
me
madam
i
think
we
have
got
through
with
it
really
there
no
occasion
for
being
so
very
rude
said
joy
rude
miss
colishaw
gave
an
acrid
laugh
mine
ai
fashionable
manners
i
know
but
i
guess
they
about
as
good
she
opened
the
front
door
and
held
it
suggestively
wide
joy
swept
through
come
miss
arden
she
called
back
over
her
shoulder
candace
could
do
nothing
but
look
as
apologetic
as
she
felt
i
so
sorry
she
murmured
as
she
passed
miss
colishaw
you
have
done
anything
it
she
who
ought
to
be
sorry
returned
miss
colishaw
and
banged
the
door
behind
her
as
she
passed
through
what
a
horrid
old
person
said
joy
who
looked
heated
and
vexed
i
never
met
any
one
so
impertinent
and
such
a
fool
too
why
she
takes
in
sewing
i
am
told
or
makes
cake
some
of
those
things
as
poor
as
job
turkey
yet
there
she
sits
with
those
valuable
things
absolutely
wasting
in
her
poky
old
house
and
refuses
to
sell
them
i
wish
i
had
spoken
more
strongly
to
her
i
declare
i
a
good
mind
to
go
back
and
do
it
now
it
is
such
perfect
folly
she
really
ought
to
be
reasoned
out
of
it
oh
i
would
urged
candace
i
would
go
back
she
was
angry
i
do
know
what
she
would
say
if
you
did
my
dear
i
do
care
a
red
cent
what
she
says
all
the
old
women
on
the
point
ca
frighten
declared
joy
she
reflected
a
little
then
she
gave
up
her
intention
after
all
it
is
worth
the
trouble
she
just
that
sort
of
obstinate
old
creature
who
will
never
listen
to
a
word
of
advice
i
knew
the
moment
i
looked
at
her
that
nothing
i
could
say
would
do
any
good
generally
i
can
turn
that
kind
of
person
round
my
finger
why
you
be
surprised
if
i
told
you
of
the
bargains
i
have
got
out
of
old
garrets
over
on
conanicut
and
down
the
island
but
really
and
truly
i
a
little
tired
of
it
and
i
never
did
care
much
for
such
old
duds
except
that
other
people
have
them
and
it
is
the
thing
to
have
them
rather
go
to
howard
any
day
and
get
a
lot
of
nice
french
china
howard
has
such
exquisite
things
always
so
the
carriage
was
ordered
to
coddington
cove
and
as
they
rolled
smoothly
past
the
maitland
woods
neither
joy
nor
candace
guessed
that
at
that
moment
miss
colishaw
was
sitting
in
her
little
with
the
old
in
her
lap
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
it
bad
enough
to
be
old
and
poor
and
alone
in
the
world
she
sobbed
to
herself
without
having
fine
folks
coming
right
in
to
sauce
you
out
of
your
senses
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
looked
for
a
minute
at
the
pitcher
betsey
colishaw
you
a
fool
she
remarked
aloud
you
might
have
kept
your
temper
the
woman
did
hurt
you
any
and
there
was
that
young
thing
looking
so
kind
of
sorry
you
might
have
said
a
pleasant
word
to
her
anyhow
even
if
you
were
all
riled
up
with
the
other
on
sped
the
carriage
the
lovely
upper
bay
always
in
sight
until
on
the
curve
of
the
long
coddington
point
it
turned
and
retraced
its
course
so
as
to
strike
washington
street
at
the
lower
end
it
was
a
delicious
afternoon
the
tide
was
flowing
freshly
in
and
the
brisk
northwest
breeze
which
met
it
sent
little
dancing
all
over
the
surface
crafts
of
all
kinds
were
traversing
the
harbor
yachts
and
were
out
in
numbers
schooners
and
barges
sped
up
the
bay
their
sails
shining
against
the
green
island
shores
and
were
crossing
and
recrossing
between
the
city
and
the
fort
and
torpedo
station
a
sharp
double
whistle
announced
the
eolus
just
started
on
her
up
trip
with
a
long
wake
of
creamy
foam
behind
her
fleets
of
white
clouds
were
drifting
across
the
sky
which
was
bluer
than
the
sea
like
ships
of
heaven
simulating
and
repeating
the
movements
of
those
of
earth
below
every
wharf
and
dock
was
full
of
people
fishing
idling
or
preparing
to
go
out
in
boats
it
was
one
of
the
moments
when
all
mankind
seems
to
be
and
to
have
laid
aside
all
memory
of
the
labors
and
the
pains
of
this
world
joy
probably
felt
that
she
owed
candace
some
compensation
for
the
unpleasant
quarter
of
an
hour
which
she
had
led
her
into
at
miss
colishaw
for
she
did
her
best
to
be
entertaining
and
to
tell
everything
that
she
herself
knew
about
washington
street
and
its
notabilities
she
pointed
out
the
two
pretty
old
houses
which
have
been
so
cleverly
modernized
into
comfort
without
any
sacrifice
of
their
quaint
exteriors
and
the
other
and
still
finer
one
once
belonging
to
the
hunter
family
whose
renovations
have
gone
so
far
toward
spoiling
it
it
used
to
have
a
nice
old
staircase
with
a
broad
landing
and
windows
over
the
water
and
beautiful
mahogany
balusters
explained
joy
but
they
spoiled
all
that
they
have
painted
over
the
elegant
satinwood
and
old
cherry
wainscotings
and
taken
out
the
secret
staircase
and
now
it
no
better
than
any
other
square
house
with
that
kind
of
roof
was
there
a
secret
staircase
cried
candace
oh
what
a
pity
they
took
it
out
i
always
thought
i
should
like
to
see
one
so
much
i
do
believe
this
would
have
interested
you
particularly
it
was
only
a
kind
of
narrow
which
was
not
commonly
used
they
do
say
though
that
ghosts
used
to
be
heard
running
up
and
down
it
quite
often
ghosts
how
strange
what
sort
of
noise
did
they
make
i
suppose
no
one
ever
saw
them
one
lady
did
really
candace
eyes
were
wide
with
attention
yes
she
was
a
friend
of
mine
and
she
used
to
board
in
the
house
before
it
was
altered
she
heard
the
noises
which
were
a
sort
of
scratching
and
rustling
and
she
resolved
to
see
what
the
ghost
was
like
so
she
took
a
candle
and
followed
it
downstairs
how
brave
and
what
was
it
like
it
was
like
a
rat
when
she
caught
sight
of
it
it
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
pot
of
lard
it
was
picking
its
teeth
she
said
a
pot
of
lard
yes
the
secret
staircase
led
down
to
a
sort
of
cellar
you
see
oh
joy
how
disappointing
i
afraid
ghost
stories
generally
do
turn
out
disappointing
in
the
end
here
we
are
close
to
old
fort
greene
would
you
like
to
jump
out
and
run
down
to
the
water
edge
and
see
it
oh
thank
you
i
should
like
it
ever
so
much
it
was
but
a
few
steps
from
the
carriage
to
the
grassy
top
of
the
old
redoubt
but
when
cannie
had
picked
her
way
down
the
steep
incline
toward
the
shore
she
found
herself
entirely
out
of
sight
of
the
street
and
the
houses
out
of
sight
of
everything
except
the
lovely
sunlit
bay
which
stretched
before
her
there
was
no
sound
except
the
plash
of
the
waves
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
much
alone
as
if
she
had
been
in
the
depths
of
a
country
solitude
then
another
sound
came
vaguely
to
her
ear
a
low
murmur
of
conversation
and
she
became
aware
that
the
fort
held
other
visitors
besides
herself
a
rock
hid
the
speakers
from
her
whoever
they
might
be
the
voices
were
too
indistinct
for
recognition
and
it
was
accident
rather
than
intention
which
led
her
to
diverge
from
the
path
as
she
returned
to
the
carriage
in
a
manner
which
gave
her
a
view
of
the
party
there
were
three
persons
a
man
and
two
girls
the
man
was
young
and
he
was
also
well
dressed
but
there
was
something
about
him
which
even
to
candace
inexperience
suggested
the
idea
that
he
was
not
quite
a
gentleman
one
of
the
girls
was
standing
with
her
back
to
candace
talking
eagerly
in
a
hushed
voice
the
other
sat
on
a
stone
in
an
attitude
of
troubled
dejection
her
face
was
in
shadow
but
she
turned
a
little
as
candace
passed
and
to
her
wondering
surprise
she
saw
that
it
was
no
other
than
her
cousin
georgie
gray
chapter
ix
perplexed
candace
paused
for
a
second
surprised
and
hesitating
then
she
walked
on
again
georgie
had
not
seemed
to
observe
her
the
other
girl
was
doubtless
berry
joy
with
whom
she
was
less
at
ease
than
with
anybody
else
she
felt
not
the
least
desire
to
confront
her
and
a
strange
man
to
boot
besides
joy
must
not
be
kept
waiting
that
looks
like
berry
village
cart
exclaimed
joy
as
they
drove
past
a
side
street
where
a
little
vehicle
stood
drawn
up
in
the
shade
under
the
care
of
a
natty
groom
was
that
james
and
the
cart
wilkins
yes
i
believe
it
was
i
wonder
where
the
girls
can
be
continued
joy
at
the
parishes
most
likely
taking
afternoon
tea
that
a
very
favorite
place
at
sunset
with
all
the
young
people
there
is
such
a
wide
piazza
and
a
splendid
view
having
said
this
she
dismissed
the
subject
from
her
mind
they
lingered
so
long
in
thames
street
over
various
errands
that
it
was
nearly
before
candace
reached
home
georgie
was
there
before
her
she
still
had
her
bonnet
on
and
was
sitting
on
the
piazza
with
her
mother
and
gertrude
giving
an
account
of
her
afternoon
and
then
we
drove
down
to
the
old
point
and
called
on
the
parishes
she
concluded
and
mamma
as
we
came
away
miss
gisborne
saw
us
from
her
window
and
called
out
that
i
was
to
tell
you
that
somebody
card
caird
some
englishman
at
all
events
was
coming
and
would
you
please
be
sure
to
lunch
with
her
on
wednesday
and
meet
him
caird
the
artist
yes
i
know
miss
gisborne
was
expecting
him
georgie
seemed
to
have
finished
her
narrative
she
had
not
said
a
word
about
fort
greene
now
candace
what
are
your
adventures
demanded
gertrude
it
is
quite
exciting
after
a
dull
afternoon
on
the
sofa
to
have
you
all
come
in
and
tell
me
what
you
have
been
about
i
watched
you
drive
away
with
a
face
like
a
frightened
kitten
you
would
have
seen
me
looking
a
great
deal
more
frightened
if
you
had
been
with
us
at
miss
colishaw
said
candace
and
she
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
happened
in
a
quiet
demure
way
which
was
particularly
funny
throwing
in
a
little
unconscious
mimicry
which
made
the
scene
real
to
her
audience
miss
colishaw
grim
indignation
joy
cool
audacity
her
own
compunctious
helplessness
all
were
indicated
in
turn
before
she
had
done
they
were
in
fits
of
indignant
laughter
well
really
i
did
not
think
even
joy
could
behave
so
outrageously
as
that
remarked
gertrude
it
is
really
too
bad
said
gray
miss
colishaw
is
one
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
always
working
herself
to
death
for
anybody
who
is
sick
or
in
trouble
or
poorer
than
herself
i
am
afraid
her
feelings
were
really
hurt
she
is
sensitive
about
her
poverty
and
has
a
great
regard
for
her
old
family
relics
i
feared
that
there
might
be
some
mistake
about
her
wishing
to
sell
her
china
when
joy
spoke
about
it
but
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
saw
the
old
lady
and
i
thought
it
possible
that
something
had
occurred
to
make
her
glad
of
the
money
i
am
really
shocked
at
mrs
joy
if
only
i
could
have
seen
her
at
the
cupboard
with
the
in
her
hand
and
miss
colishaw
face
cried
gertrude
with
another
burst
of
laughter
well
after
this
truly
awful
interview
what
did
you
do
next
candace
we
drove
to
coddington
cove
and
then
we
came
back
to
washington
street
and
joy
told
me
about
the
old
houses
and
then
she
stopped
the
carriage
by
old
fort
greene
and
i
went
down
to
the
shore
to
look
at
it
did
you
said
georgie
with
sudden
interest
why
why
berry
and
i
were
there
too
we
ran
down
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
saw
you
said
candace
simply
she
was
looking
straight
at
georgie
as
she
spoke
and
was
surprised
to
see
her
flush
suddenly
and
then
turn
as
suddenly
pale
her
change
of
color
was
so
marked
that
her
mother
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
notice
it
had
her
attention
not
been
for
the
moment
occupied
by
frederic
who
just
brought
out
a
note
which
required
an
answer
gertrude
was
looking
another
way
only
candace
noticed
georgie
unwonted
emotion
nothing
more
was
said
about
fort
greene
at
the
time
but
a
little
later
when
she
was
in
her
room
smoothing
her
hair
for
dinner
georgie
tapped
at
the
door
cannie
she
said
i
going
to
ask
you
not
to
say
anything
more
to
anybody
about
having
seen
berry
and
me
on
washington
street
certainly
i
wo
replied
candace
making
in
her
surprise
one
of
those
hasty
promises
which
are
so
often
repented
of
afterward
but
why
not
oh
well
there
are
no
very
important
reasons
it
just
that
i
would
rather
you
would
very
well
but
candace
felt
vaguely
dissatisfied
with
this
explanation
and
a
little
curious
she
thought
of
this
promise
and
of
georgie
odd
manner
of
exacting
it
from
her
as
she
fell
asleep
that
night
and
again
the
next
morning
but
gradually
it
faded
from
her
mind
until
about
ten
days
later
something
occurred
to
revive
the
remembrance
joy
called
to
ask
two
of
the
girls
to
drive
with
berry
and
herself
to
see
the
polo
play
gertrude
happened
to
be
out
so
candace
fell
heir
to
her
share
of
the
invitation
gray
was
glad
to
have
her
go
she
herself
did
not
often
visit
the
polo
ground
and
she
thought
candace
would
enjoy
seeing
a
match
and
that
it
would
be
something
pleasant
for
her
to
remember
the
polo
ground
is
a
large
enclosure
to
the
south
of
spring
street
and
well
out
of
the
town
it
is
shut
in
by
a
high
paling
built
with
the
intention
of
excluding
every
one
who
does
not
pay
for
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
the
game
nature
however
that
dame
has
frustrated
this
precaution
by
providing
close
to
the
paling
a
little
rocky
bluff
or
rise
of
land
not
owned
by
the
polo
association
whose
top
commands
a
clear
view
over
the
fence
and
on
polo
days
this
point
of
vantage
is
usually
well
filled
by
of
an
impecunious
description
there
was
quite
a
little
crowd
on
the
brow
of
deadhead
hill
as
it
is
called
when
joy
carriage
turned
in
at
the
gates
and
she
glanced
that
way
and
said
it
is
really
too
bad
about
that
hill
in
a
dissatisfied
tone
as
if
the
enjoyment
of
these
jarred
in
some
way
or
interfered
with
the
pleasure
for
which
she
herself
was
forced
to
pay
a
round
price
inside
the
gate
appeared
a
large
railed
enclosure
with
a
wicket
at
either
end
and
about
this
carriages
full
of
gay
people
were
drawn
up
in
rows
two
or
three
abreast
the
ponies
which
were
to
be
used
in
the
game
were
being
led
up
and
down
on
the
farther
side
of
the
ground
where
was
a
range
of
presently
a
bell
rang
there
was
a
little
confusion
of
unblanketing
and
mounting
and
eight
riders
armed
with
long
mallets
rode
forward
four
wore
red
caps
and
four
blue
and
the
two
colors
ranged
themselves
opposite
each
other
at
the
wickets
the
umpire
tossed
a
little
ball
into
the
middle
of
the
ground
and
the
game
began
candace
was
at
first
rather
inclined
to
laugh
at
the
riders
who
were
so
much
too
tall
for
their
little
steeds
that
in
some
cases
their
legs
seemed
in
danger
of
hitting
the
ground
but
before
long
she
had
become
so
interested
in
the
game
and
the
bold
riding
that
she
no
longer
felt
inclined
to
laugh
the
object
of
each
side
was
to
drive
the
ball
through
its
own
wicket
and
to
effect
this
a
great
deal
of
both
courage
and
skill
were
required
not
only
on
the
part
of
the
horsemen
but
of
the
ponies
as
well
more
than
once
all
the
eight
seemed
to
be
collected
in
a
breathless
tangle
about
and
above
the
ball
crowding
pushing
struggling
for
the
chance
at
a
stroke
and
in
such
cases
the
ponies
seemed
to
divide
the
excitement
with
their
masters
and
fenced
and
curved
and
described
indescribably
short
circles
regardless
of
the
danger
of
getting
a
hard
rap
from
the
cruel
mallets
on
their
own
poor
little
hoofs
then
when
some
lucky
hit
sent
the
ball
spinning
across
the
ground
it
was
quite
beautiful
to
see
the
alacrity
with
which
the
little
creatures
of
their
own
accord
as
it
were
rushed
after
it
obeying
the
slightest
indication
from
rein
or
spur
and
apparently
measuring
the
distance
and
the
opportunities
as
accurately
as
their
riders
the
beat
of
their
small
hoofs
on
the
smooth
ground
was
so
swift
and
even
that
it
was
more
like
a
rustle
than
a
rush
to
and
fro
flew
the
ball
now
almost
at
the
blue
wicket
then
reached
and
sent
back
in
the
very
nick
of
time
by
one
of
the
red
champions
candace
was
so
fascinated
that
she
had
no
eyes
for
any
one
else
till
turning
her
head
by
accident
her
eye
lighted
upon
a
face
in
the
crowd
near
the
carriage
and
with
a
flash
of
recognition
she
knew
that
it
was
the
stranger
of
whom
she
had
caught
that
momentary
glimpse
at
fort
greene
involuntarily
she
glanced
at
berry
joy
and
georgie
and
perceived
that
the
former
had
seen
the
man
also
and
was
trying
to
look
as
if
she
had
not
seen
him
while
the
latter
was
honestly
unconscious
there
was
something
odd
about
the
man
manner
which
kept
candace
attention
fixed
he
seemed
to
be
standing
carelessly
among
other
spectators
watching
the
game
and
yet
by
a
series
of
dexterous
movements
and
small
shiftings
of
position
he
was
gradually
edging
toward
the
carriage
presently
a
forward
step
more
decided
than
the
rest
brought
him
close
to
it
georgie
saw
him
now
a
deep
color
flushed
her
face
she
lowered
her
parasol
as
if
to
hide
it
i
believe
you
dropped
this
madam
said
the
man
stooping
suddenly
as
if
to
pick
something
up
from
the
ground
and
handing
to
berry
what
seemed
to
be
a
note
oh
thanks
said
berry
in
a
confused
voice
quite
different
from
her
ordinary
voice
the
stranger
raised
his
hat
formally
and
moved
aside
what
was
that
asked
joy
who
had
been
watching
the
game
and
had
seen
nothing
of
this
did
you
drop
something
berry
only
a
note
from
julia
prime
answered
berry
slipping
the
paper
in
her
pocket
it
was
very
civil
of
that
person
whoever
he
was
said
joy
unsuspiciously
berry
and
georgie
exchanged
looks
candace
was
at
a
loss
what
to
think
there
are
few
better
keepers
of
secrets
than
shy
people
they
do
not
let
things
out
by
accident
as
talkative
persons
do
it
is
easier
for
them
to
be
silent
than
to
talk
to
keep
counsel
than
to
betray
it
but
apart
from
being
shy
candace
instincts
were
honorable
she
had
a
distaste
of
interfering
with
other
people
affairs
or
seeming
to
pry
into
them
she
said
not
a
word
to
any
one
about
this
matter
of
the
polo
ground
and
she
tried
not
to
think
about
it
although
it
was
not
in
human
nature
not
to
feel
a
little
curiosity
and
she
caught
herself
observing
georgie
rather
more
than
usual
though
without
intending
it
this
quickened
observation
showed
her
two
things
first
that
georgie
had
something
on
her
mind
and
secondly
that
she
was
determined
not
to
show
it
she
laughed
and
talked
rather
more
than
was
her
custom
and
if
the
laughter
was
a
little
forced
no
one
else
seemed
to
find
it
out
there
were
times
when
candace
almost
persuaded
herself
that
the
whole
thing
was
the
effect
of
her
own
imagination
which
had
exaggerated
something
that
was
perfectly
commonplace
into
importance
simply
because
she
did
not
understand
it
and
then
again
she
doubted
and
was
sure
that
georgie
was
not
like
her
usual
self
so
another
week
went
by
and
brought
them
to
september
there
was
no
sign
of
autumn
as
yet
every
leaf
was
as
green
and
fresh
on
its
bough
every
geranium
as
bright
on
its
stalk
as
if
summer
were
just
beginning
instead
of
just
ended
but
with
the
presage
which
sends
the
bird
southward
long
before
the
cold
is
felt
and
teaches
the
caterpillar
to
roll
its
cocoon
and
the
squirrel
to
make
ready
its
winter
nest
and
store
of
nuts
the
gay
summer
crowd
began
to
melt
away
every
day
brought
a
lessened
list
of
arrivals
at
the
hotels
and
already
there
was
that
sense
of
a
season
over
and
done
with
and
about
to
be
laid
up
and
shelved
for
the
winter
which
all
know
so
well
and
which
is
as
a
nipping
frost
to
the
hopes
of
landlords
and
letters
of
lodgings
just
why
finis
should
be
written
so
early
on
the
fair
page
of
the
newport
season
it
is
hard
to
explain
for
charming
as
is
the
summer
september
and
october
are
more
charming
still
and
nowhere
does
the
later
autumn
exhibit
a
more
indulgent
mood
holding
back
the
winter
till
the
last
possible
moment
and
sometimes
coaxing
summer
to
aid
and
abet
with
supplies
of
greenery
and
flowers
till
the
new
year
comes
to
put
an
end
to
the
merry
game
gray
began
to
go
to
town
in
the
boat
for
two
or
three
days
of
business
though
he
still
spent
the
larger
half
of
the
week
in
newport
marian
was
sent
to
lenox
for
a
week
visit
to
an
aunt
the
family
seemed
very
small
now
and
when
gray
one
monday
morning
announced
her
intention
of
running
up
to
boston
next
day
for
the
night
and
taking
gertrude
with
her
georgie
loudly
protested
it
is
really
cruel
of
you
mamma
cannie
and
i
will
feel
like
two
deserted
little
scraps
all
alone
in
this
big
house
i
do
think
you
might
wait
till
papa
is
at
home
and
there
marian
coming
back
night
what
on
earth
shall
we
do
with
her
all
day
she
will
feel
dreadfully
to
find
you
gone
i
am
sorry
about
marian
confessed
gray
but
tuesday
happens
to
be
the
best
day
for
us
on
several
accounts
you
and
candace
must
be
particularly
good
to
her
and
not
let
her
feel
aggrieved
or
forlorn
i
have
ordered
the
breakfasts
and
luncheons
and
dinner
for
and
wednesday
so
you
will
have
no
housekeeping
to
trouble
you
and
we
shall
be
back
at
six
you
know
two
days
are
but
a
short
time
after
all
you
might
ask
a
couple
of
girls
to
dine
with
you
any
one
you
like
but
georgie
seemed
out
of
spirits
she
was
dull
and
dreamy
and
said
she
did
care
to
invite
anybody
she
would
rather
have
a
nice
lazy
time
by
themselves
if
candace
liked
it
just
as
well
candace
who
had
made
up
her
mind
to
the
inevitable
berry
joy
was
glad
to
be
let
off
so
she
spent
a
very
quiet
day
for
georgie
went
to
her
room
as
soon
as
lunch
was
over
to
lie
down
as
she
said
and
sleep
off
a
little
headache
and
candace
was
left
alone
till
nearly
marian
arrival
from
the
train
brought
a
little
stir
and
variety
but
it
was
not
of
the
most
pleasurable
kind
for
she
was
so
disappointed
and
indignant
at
finding
her
mother
absent
that
till
the
first
sharp
sting
of
vexation
had
abated
nothing
could
be
got
out
of
her
but
sobs
and
broken
words
of
complaint
even
when
she
grew
calmer
things
were
still
rather
melancholy
for
she
was
too
tired
and
depressed
for
speech
and
just
sat
in
silence
leaning
her
head
against
candace
shoulder
until
bedtime
nor
did
georgie
and
candace
find
much
to
say
to
each
other
after
she
had
departed
georgie
remarked
rather
peevishly
that
marian
was
a
most
cross
tiresome
child
sometimes
and
candace
said
yes
poor
little
thing
but
she
was
really
very
tired
this
time
as
well
as
cross
then
each
took
a
book
and
read
to
herself
till
ten
when
they
separated
with
a
brief
it
was
a
great
contrast
to
the
usual
bright
cheerful
evenings
of
the
household
and
cannie
as
she
undressed
was
conscious
of
being
homesick
she
would
have
called
it
but
the
phrase
did
not
justly
express
her
mood
for
even
on
that
dull
evening
i
am
very
sure
that
she
did
not
pine
for
aunt
myra
or
for
the
north
tolland
which
was
the
only
place
she
had
ever
called
by
the
name
of
home
the
next
day
opened
more
brightly
marian
was
asked
to
lunch
with
the
frewens
who
were
her
favorite
friends
and
her
absence
was
something
of
a
relief
to
the
others
georgie
and
candace
did
their
little
morning
tasks
not
forgetting
the
arrangement
of
the
fresh
flowers
which
usually
fell
to
gertrude
share
then
georgie
sat
down
to
practise
and
candace
settled
herself
in
a
deep
cushioned
chair
in
the
library
with
motley
dutch
republic
which
she
was
reading
for
the
first
time
it
was
the
chapter
on
the
siege
of
leyden
and
the
wild
fantastic
nocturne
by
chopin
which
georgie
was
playing
seemed
to
blend
and
mix
itself
with
the
tragic
narrative
candace
did
not
know
how
long
the
reading
and
the
music
had
been
going
on
each
complementing
the
other
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
book
as
not
to
heed
the
sound
of
the
bell
or
noiseless
tread
as
he
crossed
the
hall
to
answer
it
but
she
roused
from
her
absorption
as
the
nocturne
came
suddenly
to
an
end
with
a
crash
of
startled
chords
and
georgie
hands
fell
from
the
keys
at
the
sight
of
berry
joy
who
came
hurriedly
in
at
the
door
candace
in
her
corner
was
invisible
oh
georgie
that
dreadful
creature
is
here
again
she
heard
berry
say
while
georgie
answered
with
a
little
despairing
cry
not
really
oh
berry
what
shall
we
do
then
came
a
long
whispered
confabulation
then
another
tinkle
at
the
frederic
i
am
engaged
georgie
called
come
upstairs
berry
if
we
stay
here
some
one
is
certain
to
break
in
the
two
rushed
across
the
hall
candace
heard
their
rapid
steps
on
the
stairs
then
door
shut
with
a
bang
and
all
was
still
her
book
dropped
into
her
lap
unheeded
her
mind
was
full
of
puzzled
amazement
who
was
the
dreadful
creature
and
what
it
all
mean
the
silence
in
the
house
was
unbroken
except
by
the
of
the
tall
clock
it
made
her
nervous
at
last
and
she
went
out
on
the
lawn
to
get
rid
of
the
sensation
she
picked
a
few
flowers
pulled
the
from
one
of
the
geraniums
under
her
care
and
spent
some
minutes
in
petting
and
fondling
marian
pretty
colly
who
lay
stretched
out
luxuriously
in
the
full
rays
of
the
mild
september
sunshine
then
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
berry
figure
passing
out
of
the
gate
and
went
back
to
the
house
the
was
empty
motley
lay
on
the
floor
where
she
had
dropped
him
she
picked
up
the
volume
and
slowly
mounted
the
stairs
as
she
passed
through
the
upper
entry
she
heard
a
sound
from
the
was
it
a
sob
candace
gently
approached
the
door
again
the
sound
came
an
unmistakable
sob
and
looking
in
she
saw
georgie
lying
on
her
mother
sofa
with
her
face
hidden
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
saying
over
and
over
to
herself
in
a
voice
which
was
like
a
moan
what
shall
i
do
oh
what
shall
i
do
chapter
x
a
word
fitly
spoken
all
candace
timidity
fled
at
the
sight
of
georgie
distress
she
hurried
across
the
room
knelt
down
by
the
sofa
and
took
her
hand
which
was
as
cold
as
a
stone
between
her
own
warm
ones
what
is
it
georgie
do
cry
so
georgie
dear
please
do
oh
what
is
the
matter
she
said
in
a
voice
so
soft
and
affectionate
and
pleading
that
it
made
its
way
straight
to
poor
miserable
heart
she
still
sobbed
she
still
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
but
she
let
cannie
hold
her
hand
and
stroke
and
kiss
it
and
seemed
to
find
a
little
soothing
in
the
kind
touch
and
the
tender
words
after
a
while
the
sobs
grew
fainter
and
georgie
lay
half
exhausted
with
her
eyes
shut
only
now
and
then
giving
cannie
hand
a
squeeze
hers
was
one
of
those
natures
which
can
not
bear
to
suffer
alone
whatever
was
the
matter
georgie
instinctively
reached
out
for
sympathy
to
the
nearest
source
from
which
it
could
be
had
gertrude
her
natural
confidante
was
away
and
candace
her
sweet
face
full
of
pity
and
concern
was
close
at
hand
her
touch
felt
warm
and
comforting
her
tender
voice
was
irresistible
to
georgie
desolate
mood
she
turned
her
wet
face
with
a
sudden
burst
of
gratitude
and
trust
toward
the
little
cousin
whom
she
had
till
now
held
so
cheaply
and
who
at
that
moment
seemed
the
only
friend
left
within
reach
cannie
she
said
i
a
great
mind
to
tell
you
then
she
stopped
confidence
is
like
a
timid
bird
which
hops
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
hand
that
holds
out
a
crumb
but
all
the
while
keeps
its
wings
half
poised
for
flight
should
a
gesture
alarm
it
candace
had
the
instinctive
wisdom
of
a
loving
heart
she
did
not
interrupt
georgie
with
a
word
only
her
anxious
eyes
asked
the
questions
which
her
tongue
did
not
utter
i
am
in
such
trouble
said
georgie
thawing
more
and
more
under
the
influence
of
cannie
silence
and
cannie
look
in
such
a
dreadful
scrape
oh
what
will
become
of
me
wringing
her
hands
you
are
so
good
cannie
so
kind
will
you
promise
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
anybody
if
i
tell
you
all
about
it
yes
said
candace
i
promise
i
know
you
can
keep
a
secret
continued
georgie
sighing
heavily
you
never
said
a
word
about
that
time
at
fort
greene
yet
i
know
you
must
have
wondered
what
it
all
meant
a
little
pause
then
she
went
on
there
really
was
any
harm
in
it
when
it
began
it
was
last
winter
one
day
berry
and
i
had
been
laughing
over
some
of
the
in
the
and
just
for
fun
we
wrote
one
ourselves
and
sent
it
to
the
paper
it
was
an
advertisement
we
pretended
it
came
from
a
lady
who
wanted
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
an
eligible
gentleman
with
a
view
to
matrimony
we
made
it
as
ridiculous
as
we
could
and
we
signed
it
and
said
that
all
the
answers
could
be
sent
to
the
station
d
and
did
you
get
any
answers
oh
quantities
i
never
imagined
that
people
could
be
so
foolish
why
there
were
a
hundred
and
thirty
the
very
first
day
and
ever
so
many
afterward
some
of
them
were
sentimental
and
some
of
them
were
ridiculous
and
some
were
really
funny
i
think
the
funny
ones
came
from
people
who
suspected
that
the
advertisement
was
a
hoax
but
we
got
a
great
deal
of
amusement
out
of
it
and
we
never
for
a
moment
dreamed
that
any
one
would
suspect
who
put
it
in
oh
how
i
wish
we
never
had
for
it
brought
that
horrible
man
down
upon
us
and
since
then
we
have
never
had
any
peace
of
our
lives
what
horrible
man
asked
candace
more
and
more
surprised
you
saw
him
at
fort
greene
i
do
know
who
he
is
myself
really
he
says
his
name
is
james
alexander
but
he
tells
such
frightful
lies
that
i
do
believe
it
is
his
real
name
at
all
he
is
a
dreadful
creature
and
he
has
treated
us
so
georgie
broke
down
into
another
fit
of
crying
but
i
do
understand
said
candace
how
could
he
treat
you
badly
how
did
he
come
to
know
you
what
right
had
he
to
speak
to
you
at
all
oh
no
right
explained
georgie
quivering
with
sobs
it
was
only
that
he
found
out
about
the
advertisement
and
then
he
frightened
us
he
suspected
something
and
hung
about
the
and
watched
till
one
time
when
berry
and
i
went
to
get
the
letters
then
he
followed
us
home
and
found
out
where
we
both
lived
and
wrote
to
say
that
he
had
become
possessed
of
our
secret
and
that
he
was
a
poor
man
in
need
of
money
and
if
we
would
at
once
send
him
dollars
he
would
keep
silent
about
it
but
if
not
he
should
feel
bound
to
write
to
our
friends
and
let
them
know
what
we
had
been
doing
we
were
both
scared
to
death
at
this
threat
and
we
made
haste
to
send
him
the
money
hoping
that
he
would
keep
his
word
and
that
we
should
never
hear
of
him
again
but
we
might
have
known
better
for
the
very
next
week
he
wrote
again
demanding
fifty
and
so
it
has
gone
on
ever
since
he
never
gives
us
any
peace
we
have
to
send
him
all
he
asks
for
or
else
he
declares
he
will
call
on
papa
and
not
only
tell
him
about
the
advertisement
but
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
which
are
not
true
at
all
he
wo
believe
that
it
was
only
to
amuse
ourselves
that
we
sent
the
notice
to
the
paper
and
he
hints
the
most
dreadful
things
and
says
papa
and
joy
will
be
sure
to
believe
him
berry
and
i
have
grown
so
afraid
that
we
would
give
a
million
if
we
had
it
to
bribe
him
to
go
away
and
never
let
us
hear
from
him
again
but
even
that
would
be
no
use
for
he
would
come
back
and
demand
another
million
ended
poor
georgie
and
he
actually
comes
up
to
newport
and
follows
you
about
and
makes
you
give
him
money
said
candace
at
this
glimpse
of
the
hidden
suffering
endured
by
these
two
prosperous
girls
who
were
supposed
to
be
without
a
sorrow
in
the
world
indeed
he
does
he
came
that
time
when
you
saw
him
the
middle
of
august
and
he
wrote
berry
a
note
to
say
that
he
must
speak
to
us
and
that
if
we
did
meet
him
somewhere
he
should
appeal
to
joy
we
had
to
consent
of
course
and
we
gave
him
all
the
money
we
had
and
we
thought
he
was
gone
but
just
a
few
days
after
he
appeared
again
on
the
polo
ground
and
handed
berry
a
note
which
he
pretended
she
had
dropped
out
of
the
carriage
but
it
was
really
from
himself
and
he
said
that
he
had
lost
the
money
we
gave
him
on
a
bet
which
had
turned
out
badly
and
he
must
have
a
hundred
dollars
more
you
ca
think
how
hard
it
has
been
for
us
to
raise
all
this
money
cannie
berry
has
her
own
income
but
her
mother
likes
to
know
what
she
does
with
it
and
mamma
chooses
my
things
for
me
so
i
do
have
much
of
an
allowance
we
have
been
at
our
wits
end
sometimes
to
know
how
to
manage
and
how
did
you
berry
sold
a
diamond
ring
which
she
does
often
wear
so
her
mother
has
not
missed
it
and
i
put
in
thirty
dollars
which
was
all
i
had
and
he
went
away
for
good
as
we
hoped
he
promised
solemnly
not
to
come
to
newport
or
ask
us
for
money
again
this
season
and
we
were
so
relieved
for
a
few
days
i
was
almost
happy
with
a
miserable
little
laugh
but
what
fools
we
were
to
believe
him
i
ca
imagine
why
we
should
for
he
has
deceived
us
all
through
i
do
think
he
has
spoken
the
truth
once
from
the
very
beginning
berry
came
just
now
to
tell
me
that
he
is
back
already
she
saw
him
herself
this
morning
in
thames
street
he
see
her
for
she
was
in
the
close
coup√©
and
he
was
looking
in
at
a
shop
window
but
of
course
he
has
come
for
money
and
neither
of
us
has
any
more
we
shall
have
to
refuse
and
he
will
go
straight
to
papa
and
then
oh
what
will
become
of
me
she
buried
her
face
again
in
the
pillows
candace
was
trembling
with
a
mixture
of
sensations
pity
for
her
cousin
indignation
at
this
mean
persecution
of
which
she
was
the
victim
and
withal
a
fine
touch
of
scorn
over
the
weakness
which
was
so
easily
played
upon
with
all
her
country
breeding
and
ignorance
of
the
world
and
its
ways
there
was
in
our
little
maiden
a
large
share
of
the
strong
pride
of
her
ancestry
would
never
have
stooped
to
buy
the
silence
of
a
low
knave
like
this
alexander
and
her
clear
truthfulness
of
soul
indicated
at
once
the
single
straight
unerring
clew
which
could
lead
out
of
this
labyrinth
of
difficulties
georgie
she
said
after
a
moment
thought
there
is
just
one
thing
for
you
to
do
you
must
tell
cousin
kate
all
about
this
oh
candace
never
screamed
georgie
tell
mamma
have
mamma
know
i
rather
die
at
once
you
have
no
idea
how
she
despises
concealments
and
deceits
and
i
have
had
to
plot
and
contrive
almost
to
tell
lies
all
through
this
wretched
time
she
would
never
get
over
it
even
if
she
she
forgave
me
i
should
always
read
a
sort
of
contempt
in
her
eyes
whenever
she
looked
at
me
oh
mamma
mamma
and
i
love
her
so
candace
i
could
it
is
the
only
way
repeated
candace
firmly
you
have
promised
not
to
tell
exclaimed
her
cousin
starting
up
from
her
recumbent
position
you
promised
me
solemnly
you
not
forget
that
will
you
cannie
you
not
tell
mother
yourself
certainly
not
what
use
would
it
be
for
me
to
tell
her
it
would
be
only
next
best
to
having
alexander
do
it
but
you
you
georgie
that
is
a
different
thing
even
gertrude
said
she
could
advise
me
to
tell
mamma
continued
georgie
gertrude
does
gertrude
know
about
it
then
yes
i
had
to
tell
somebody
i
was
so
miserable
it
was
only
a
little
while
ago
that
i
told
her
i
kept
it
to
myself
for
a
long
time
gertrude
repeated
candace
unable
to
hide
her
amazement
and
what
did
she
say
oh
she
was
horrified
of
course
any
one
would
be
and
she
threw
a
great
deal
of
blame
on
berry
i
do
think
she
has
ever
liked
her
since
she
always
goes
out
of
the
room
when
she
comes
she
wanted
me
to
do
all
sorts
of
impossible
things
such
as
going
to
the
chief
of
police
but
about
mamma
she
felt
just
as
i
did
you
see
we
both
think
so
much
of
mamma
cannie
we
care
so
much
about
having
her
approve
of
us
you
have
any
mother
so
perhaps
you
ca
understand
no
said
candace
i
have
no
mother
perhaps
it
makes
a
difference
but
there
is
another
thing
i
ca
understand
and
that
is
how
girls
who
a
mother
such
a
mother
as
yours
georgie
can
be
content
to
keep
her
love
by
means
of
a
cheat
if
i
did
have
a
mother
i
should
want
her
to
know
all
about
me
and
approve
of
me
honestly
not
because
i
was
hiding
things
from
her
besides
there
was
a
little
choke
here
i
think
mothers
can
stand
a
good
deal
and
still
keep
on
loving
their
children
i
do
believe
cousin
kate
would
be
hard
on
you
georgie
or
despise
you
because
you
have
been
foolish
you
do
half
know
mamma
repeated
georgie
she
has
such
high
ideas
about
conduct
it
would
half
kill
her
to
know
that
i
had
even
spoken
to
a
man
like
this
alexander
of
course
she
would
be
sorry
persisted
candace
of
course
she
would
rather
that
you
had
never
got
into
this
scrape
but
she
is
so
just
always
as
well
as
kind
she
always
sees
both
sides
she
will
understand
how
it
began
that
berry
you
what
makes
you
say
that
interrupted
georgie
i
never
told
you
that
berry
me
no
but
i
knew
it
all
the
same
it
a
matter
of
course
said
candace
too
deeply
in
earnest
to
pick
her
words
or
realize
what
a
very
uncomplimentary
thing
she
was
saying
berry
joy
always
makes
you
do
whatever
she
likes
cousin
kate
will
realize
how
it
was
in
a
minute
well
never
mind
that
i
want
to
talk
about
mamma
do
you
see
that
if
i
did
tell
her
she
could
do
anything
unless
she
told
papa
and
that
is
the
very
thing
i
want
to
prevent
oh
what
was
that
as
the
clock
began
to
strike
six
they
will
be
here
in
ten
minutes
oh
dear
how
can
i
meet
her
my
eyes
are
swelled
out
of
my
head
she
will
be
sure
to
notice
and
georgie
hurried
to
the
and
began
to
smooth
the
tangled
fluffs
of
hair
on
her
forehead
cannie
heart
was
hot
within
her
but
she
wisely
forbore
further
remonstrance
she
brought
a
basin
of
water
and
a
sponge
and
helped
georgie
to
bathe
and
cool
her
face
and
to
arrange
her
dishevelled
locks
then
she
kissed
her
softly
and
moved
across
the
room
to
the
window
georgie
stole
after
her
and
stood
by
her
side
it
was
nearly
time
for
the
travellers
to
arrive
from
the
train
a
cool
was
stirring
through
the
trees
a
red
glow
could
be
seen
in
the
west
where
the
sun
was
nearing
the
horizon
there
was
a
sound
of
wheels
and
the
frewens
drove
rapidly
in
and
set
marian
down
on
the
porch
as
it
drove
away
another
carriage
met
and
passed
it
at
the
gate
it
was
the
coup√©
and
gray
and
gertrude
were
inside
with
a
shriek
of
joy
marian
shot
down
the
gravel
walk
to
meet
them
john
stopped
his
horses
gray
jumped
out
and
marian
sprang
into
her
arms
the
at
the
window
above
could
see
the
whole
pretty
picture
the
lovely
mother
the
glad
child
they
could
hear
gray
sweet
laugh
as
she
bent
over
and
kissed
marian
again
and
again
oh
georgie
georgie
cried
candace
her
eyes
suddenly
brimming
over
with
tears
look
at
that
look
at
them
was
there
ever
any
one
so
sweet
and
loving
and
dear
as
cousin
kate
see
how
she
holds
marian
in
her
arms
how
she
kisses
her
how
you
be
afraid
of
her
how
can
you
doubt
one
minute
that
she
loves
you
enough
to
forgive
anything
oh
if
i
had
such
a
mother
would
i
stay
away
from
her
and
cheat
and
conceal
and
trust
a
girl
like
berry
joy
and
a
bad
man
like
this
alexander
and
not
trust
her
not
go
to
her
first
of
all
for
help
and
advice
think
how
good
and
kind
she
is
how
glad
to
help
everybody
poor
people
servants
think
how
lovely
she
has
been
to
me
and
of
course
she
loves
you
a
hundred
times
more
how
can
you
hesitate
one
minute
oh
go
straight
to
her
dear
dear
georgie
tell
her
all
about
it
your
own
self
she
will
know
just
what
to
do
she
will
make
it
all
right
for
you
think
how
happy
you
will
be
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
any
more
oh
georgie
do
do
why
candace
i
hardly
know
you
faltered
georgie
and
she
spoke
truly
for
candace
in
her
intense
eagerness
seemed
to
grow
out
of
and
beyond
herself
and
looked
taller
older
quite
unlike
the
shy
candace
of
every
day
then
the
passion
of
her
appeal
caught
hold
of
weakness
deep
feeling
is
contagious
and
there
are
moments
when
cowards
become
temporarily
brave
candace
rush
of
words
her
mother
tender
look
and
attitude
as
she
held
marian
close
to
her
or
it
may
be
some
swift
impulse
from
her
good
angel
seemed
to
melt
her
out
of
her
mood
of
resistance
how
it
happened
she
could
not
have
told
she
never
could
tell
but
a
sudden
strength
came
to
her
and
the
next
moment
she
was
out
in
the
hall
gray
slowly
coming
upstairs
was
clasped
in
a
wild
despairing
embrace
oh
mamma
i
want
you
oh
mamma
i
something
to
tell
you
cried
georgie
her
mother
whose
smile
had
changed
to
a
look
of
pale
amazement
could
not
speak
she
suffered
herself
to
be
swept
away
the
door
of
georgie
room
closed
behind
them
and
gertrude
who
was
following
close
behind
was
left
on
the
landing
to
confront
the
equally
surprised
candace
what
is
it
what
is
georgie
going
to
say
to
mamma
demanded
gertrude
in
a
frightened
whisper
she
is
going
to
tell
her
about
that
horrible
man
who
has
been
making
her
so
unhappy
replied
candace
going
to
tell
mamma
oh
how
did
she
ever
get
courage
i
begged
her
i
told
her
it
was
the
only
way
you
why
cannie
how
did
you
dare
cried
gertrude
i
never
would
have
ventured
to
do
that
so
georgie
said
replied
candace
simply
but
i
was
sure
the
thing
to
do
was
for
her
to
go
straight
to
cousin
kate
chapter
xi
five
and
one
make
six
a
long
hush
followed
these
few
words
of
explanation
gertrude
was
too
stunned
to
ask
further
questions
mechanically
she
moved
toward
her
room
and
took
off
her
hat
and
coat
but
all
the
time
she
was
washing
her
hands
and
smoothing
her
hair
her
ears
were
strained
for
sounds
from
georgie
room
which
was
next
her
own
there
was
very
little
to
be
heard
only
a
low
continuous
murmur
of
conversation
broken
now
and
then
by
a
louder
word
but
all
so
subdued
that
candace
sitting
on
the
staircase
seat
caught
nothing
marian
rushing
up
after
her
mother
had
been
stopped
by
the
explanation
that
georgie
was
not
well
and
wanted
to
be
alone
with
mamma
after
a
little
natural
outburst
of
impatience
she
too
seemed
to
catch
the
vague
sense
of
crisis
that
was
in
the
air
and
settled
down
quietly
with
her
head
on
candace
knee
to
wait
it
was
a
long
waiting
the
red
sunset
sky
faded
into
pallor
and
the
stars
came
out
gertrude
restless
with
suspense
joined
the
other
two
both
she
and
candace
were
too
nervous
for
ordinary
talk
and
presence
precluded
any
mention
of
the
subject
with
which
their
thoughts
were
full
so
the
trio
sat
mostly
in
silence
frederic
was
heard
to
pass
down
the
upper
entry
and
announce
dinner
but
gray
only
answered
by
the
word
presently
and
did
not
open
the
door
the
shadows
grew
darker
as
the
dusk
deepened
till
after
a
while
the
gas
in
the
hall
was
lighted
when
they
fled
to
the
remoter
corners
and
consoled
themselves
by
casting
an
added
blackness
wherever
they
were
permitted
to
fall
the
only
consolation
possible
to
shadows
to
the
anxious
watchers
on
the
window
bench
the
time
seemed
very
long
and
in
fact
it
was
nearly
eight
before
georgie
door
was
heard
to
open
and
gray
to
pass
across
the
hall
to
her
own
room
she
only
stayed
there
a
few
minutes
the
girls
sprang
up
to
receive
her
as
she
came
downstairs
and
the
older
ones
looked
anxiously
in
her
face
she
was
tired
and
paler
than
usual
and
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
been
crying
but
her
smile
was
brave
and
clear
as
she
put
her
arm
round
candace
and
gave
her
a
long
kiss
you
must
be
half
starved
my
dears
she
said
georgie
has
a
bad
headache
and
i
have
sent
her
to
bed
she
wo
come
down
again
we
will
have
dinner
at
once
they
went
to
dinner
accordingly
marian
held
fast
to
her
mother
hand
but
gray
kept
the
other
arm
round
candace
and
there
was
a
warmth
and
tenderness
in
the
touch
which
thrilled
through
cannie
heart
she
felt
without
asking
why
that
cousin
kate
loved
her
more
than
usual
that
night
and
it
made
her
happy
jane
had
been
deeply
aggrieved
at
the
long
delay
of
the
dinner
but
she
was
a
woman
of
resources
as
well
as
principle
and
as
a
member
in
good
and
regular
standing
of
the
second
baptist
church
knew
that
forgiveness
of
injuries
was
a
branch
of
christian
duty
she
reminded
herself
beside
that
missis
was
often
that
inconsiderate
and
most
probably
there
was
reasons
this
time
which
made
it
easier
to
overlook
her
offence
so
she
kept
some
things
back
and
took
some
things
off
and
managed
to
send
in
the
food
in
an
eatable
condition
instead
of
letting
it
calcine
into
cinders
as
a
less
conscientious
and
capable
cook
would
have
done
marian
went
to
bed
but
still
gray
said
not
a
word
about
georgie
and
her
confession
she
looked
weary
and
preoccupied
and
gertrude
fancied
but
perhaps
it
was
only
fancy
that
there
was
a
shade
of
coldness
in
her
mother
manner
towards
herself
they
were
all
glad
when
the
time
came
to
separate
but
before
she
slept
that
night
gray
sent
a
telegram
to
her
husband
gray
appeared
next
day
on
the
earliest
possible
train
there
was
a
long
consultation
in
the
library
in
which
georgie
took
a
part
she
came
out
with
her
eyes
red
with
crying
but
somehow
looking
relieved
too
and
with
a
peaceful
look
in
her
face
which
had
been
absent
from
it
of
late
candace
passing
her
on
the
stairs
averted
her
eyes
shyly
and
was
altogether
astonished
at
being
caught
in
a
tight
embrace
and
kissed
several
times
it
all
right
georgie
whispered
papa
has
been
oh
so
kind
and
mamma
is
like
an
angel
to
me
you
were
just
right
and
i
never
can
thank
you
enough
you
dear
oh
how
glad
i
am
cried
cannie
clasping
her
hands
together
in
sudden
relief
georgie
said
no
more
she
gave
cannie
another
kiss
and
hurried
away
what
steps
gray
took
to
get
rid
of
alexander
the
girls
never
knew
but
whatever
they
may
have
been
they
were
effectual
he
disappeared
from
newport
the
very
next
day
and
neither
berry
joy
nor
georgie
ever
saw
or
heard
of
him
again
it
is
only
on
women
and
girls
and
men
who
are
as
weak
and
uninstructed
as
women
that
rascals
of
his
low
stamp
venture
to
practise
their
arts
the
moment
a
man
of
boldness
and
resource
appears
on
the
scene
one
who
knows
the
laws
and
is
not
afraid
to
invoke
their
protection
quail
and
vanish
such
an
affair
can
not
however
be
made
straight
without
a
good
deal
of
suffering
to
all
concerned
georgie
was
forgiven
she
was
saved
from
the
consequences
of
her
own
folly
and
imprudence
but
she
could
not
forgive
herself
nor
could
she
forget
the
deep
pain
and
mortification
she
had
given
to
the
parents
she
loved
or
ignore
the
fact
that
she
had
forfeited
something
of
their
good
opinion
and
that
it
would
take
her
a
long
time
to
regain
it
gertrude
too
had
her
share
to
endure
she
had
a
strong
sense
of
honor
and
a
high
opinion
of
her
own
powers
yet
in
this
the
first
real
test
of
her
life
she
had
failed
miserably
and
not
only
given
georgie
no
assistance
but
had
helped
to
confirm
her
in
her
error
berenice
joy
received
her
portion
of
punishment
in
the
shape
of
an
interview
which
she
found
most
disagreeable
with
gray
at
her
urgent
entreaty
he
gave
up
his
intention
of
telling
the
story
to
her
mother
but
she
felt
that
she
was
disgraced
in
his
eyes
and
in
those
of
gray
and
though
she
cried
and
looked
very
pretty
and
was
properly
grateful
and
distressed
and
assured
gray
that
she
should
never
forget
how
good
he
had
been
to
her
and
that
he
could
imagine
how
much
she
and
georgie
had
suffered
just
for
a
moment
of
thoughtlessness
she
was
aware
all
the
time
that
her
tears
and
her
gratitude
made
no
impression
and
that
he
did
not
believe
in
her
she
was
sure
that
all
intimacy
between
herself
and
georgie
would
be
discouraged
thenceforward
and
this
was
a
real
punishment
for
berry
counted
a
good
deal
on
the
grays
and
had
built
some
social
hopes
on
her
position
as
their
friend
her
forebodings
proved
true
her
little
gush
of
thankfulness
and
penitence
did
not
touch
gray
heart
in
the
least
he
saw
that
berry
was
a
dangerous
friend
for
his
easily
influenced
georgie
and
told
his
wife
that
he
decidedly
objected
to
the
girls
having
anything
more
to
do
with
her
gray
agreed
with
him
in
opinion
and
though
there
was
no
open
rupture
between
the
families
berry
found
herself
after
that
placed
on
the
footing
of
an
ordinary
acquaintance
and
was
never
able
to
regain
her
old
position
with
any
of
the
gray
family
but
before
this
conversation
took
place
it
was
finally
settled
that
candace
was
to
stay
always
and
be
cousin
kate
fourth
daughter
and
a
sister
to
her
three
cousins
parents
sisters
home
this
was
a
rich
endowment
indeed
for
a
lonely
orphaned
girl
to
fall
heir
to
but
cannie
had
earned
her
good
fortune
and
every
member
of
the
family
had
learned
to
value
and
to
wish
to
keep
her
it
was
gray
who
broke
the
happy
news
to
her
shall
you
like
it
will
you
be
content
to
stay
with
us
always
she
asked
why
cousin
kate
what
a
question
how
could
i
help
liking
it
i
never
knew
what
happy
meant
till
i
came
to
you
answered
cannie
flushed
with
emotion
and
pleasure
it
only
that
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
why
only
yesterday
i
was
counting
the
days
till
the
fifteenth
of
october
because
you
know
you
are
going
back
to
town
then
and
i
thought
you
would
send
me
back
to
aunt
myra
and
i
said
shall
only
be
happy
for
days
more
perhaps
only
for
you
see
i
did
feel
sure
that
you
could
keep
me
till
the
very
last
day
and
now
there
is
going
to
be
no
end
to
the
happy
times
i
ca
see
what
makes
you
so
good
to
me
cousin
kate
i
think
we
can
understand
that
better
than
you
can
her
cousin
replied
we
need
you
cannie
as
much
as
you
need
us
the
benefit
will
be
mutual
need
when
you
have
cousin
court
and
the
girls
cousin
court
and
the
girls
need
you
do
we
georgie
come
in
and
help
me
explain
to
candace
that
all
of
us
want
her
and
all
of
us
are
glad
to
have
her
stay
indeed
we
do
cannie
i
ca
talk
about
it
for
it
like
a
bad
dream
from
which
i
have
waked
up
and
i
do
like
to
recall
it
but
i
never
shall
forget
how
good
you
were
to
me
that
horrible
day
it
was
you
who
persuaded
me
to
go
to
mamma
i
never
should
have
gone
if
you
somehow
swept
me
up
and
made
me
and
oh
if
i
had
how
could
i
be
afraid
of
you
dear
darling
mamma
she
was
just
what
you
said
she
would
be
cannie
she
knew
just
what
to
do
she
understood
in
a
moment
she
was
so
kind
i
feel
as
if
trinity
church
had
been
rolled
off
my
mind
it
was
all
your
doing
and
i
never
can
forget
it
georgie
is
right
said
gray
do
look
so
bewildered
dear
you
did
her
a
real
service
in
persuading
her
to
be
brave
and
frank
i
know
why
it
is
so
hard
for
children
to
trust
their
parents
it
is
the
parents
fault
somehow
no
doubt
oh
mother
it
was
only
that
i
dreaded
to
have
you
think
ill
of
me
not
quite
said
gray
shaking
her
head
i
must
blame
myself
a
little
i
must
have
made
some
mistake
with
you
all
when
even
gertrude
could
not
believe
that
i
would
not
be
harsh
and
unforgiving
but
we
have
had
our
lesson
georgie
and
we
will
not
do
so
badly
again
especially
as
there
will
be
this
dear
little
new
sister
of
yours
to
help
us
to
keep
straight
we
need
not
talk
any
more
about
it
but
cannie
we
all
feel
that
to
have
you
with
us
will
be
good
for
us
all
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
rare
and
so
precious
as
clear
truth
and
the
courage
to
hold
fast
by
it
and
we
have
proved
that
you
possess
both
and
do
you
think
that
it
will
be
good
for
me
said
cannie
her
eyes
shining
with
grateful
tears
yes
we
can
help
you
too
it
is
one
of
the
good
things
in
this
world
that
help
is
almost
always
on
both
marian
as
that
small
person
passed
the
door
what
do
you
think
of
having
cannie
permanently
for
a
sister
really
will
she
stay
oh
how
perfectly
daisy
and
marian
threw
her
arms
round
candace
neck
and
gave
her
a
squeeze
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
approval
of
the
plan
only
one
cloud
now
remained
on
candace
horizon
of
happiness
gray
had
become
like
a
very
mother
to
her
her
bright
perpetual
tenderness
was
like
daily
food
to
candace
hungering
heart
gray
had
taken
her
into
the
highest
favor
he
had
always
liked
cannie
and
been
kind
to
her
but
now
he
petted
her
almost
as
much
as
he
petted
marian
he
scarcely
ever
came
back
from
new
york
without
bringing
her
some
little
gift
a
book
a
trinket
a
box
of
bonbons
as
a
proof
that
she
had
been
in
his
thoughts
the
latest
and
prettiest
of
these
was
on
her
finger
now
a
pearl
ring
with
the
word
truth
engraved
inside
its
golden
circlet
georgie
and
marian
had
welcomed
her
heartily
but
gertrude
gertrude
had
said
nothing
she
was
always
cordial
now
and
a
sort
of
added
respect
and
liking
had
appeared
in
her
manner
since
the
alexander
episode
but
about
the
new
arrangement
which
made
candace
one
of
the
family
she
had
not
spoken
a
word
till
she
did
till
she
was
sure
that
gertrude
too
was
content
to
have
her
stay
cannie
happiness
could
not
be
complete
the
fourteenth
of
october
at
length
arrived
it
was
the
last
day
of
their
newport
season
but
candace
no
longer
dreaded
the
it
did
not
mean
separation
and
loneliness
now
only
the
change
to
a
new
and
different
scene
which
might
be
as
delightful
in
its
way
as
the
summer
had
been
yet
newport
was
still
in
full
beauty
and
it
seemed
a
pity
to
leave
it
no
frosts
had
fallen
to
dim
the
glory
of
the
flowers
the
honeysuckles
were
still
starred
with
their
white
blossoms
the
geranium
beds
looked
as
gay
the
foliage
plants
as
superb
as
ever
while
the
green
of
the
grass
was
as
fresh
as
in
july
here
and
there
a
little
drift
of
yellow
leaves
lay
under
the
trees
but
it
was
the
only
sign
of
autumn
georgie
gathered
a
great
basketful
of
nasturtiums
heliotrope
and
mignonette
to
carry
down
to
miss
gisborne
and
marian
was
sent
off
in
the
with
a
similar
basketful
for
frewen
the
house
was
all
in
a
confusion
of
packing
frederic
was
wrapping
round
the
elizabeth
counting
linen
and
silver
the
gardeners
emptying
the
balcony
boxes
gray
proposed
that
gertrude
and
candace
should
go
for
a
last
walk
on
the
cliffs
and
so
be
out
of
the
way
of
these
discomforts
there
is
nothing
for
you
to
do
she
said
only
do
stay
too
late
and
come
in
before
it
grows
dark
we
are
to
have
a
tea
at
six
in
place
of
a
regular
dinner
i
thought
it
would
be
less
trouble
on
this
busy
day
it
was
to
pulpit
rock
that
the
two
cousins
bent
their
way
the
cliffs
were
even
lonelier
now
than
they
had
been
when
candace
first
visited
them
there
were
no
bathers
in
the
surf
no
carriages
were
drawn
up
on
the
higher
part
of
the
beach
and
the
road
leading
around
easton
point
showed
only
a
few
scattered
figures
and
one
solitary
horseman
on
its
entire
length
here
and
there
along
the
windings
of
the
cliff
walk
a
single
walker
appeared
dark
against
the
brightness
of
the
sky
or
two
girls
were
seen
pacing
the
smooth
gravel
with
fluttering
dresses
and
hair
blown
by
the
soft
october
wind
the
sea
was
as
beautiful
in
color
as
ever
but
it
had
changed
with
the
change
of
the
season
the
blue
seemed
more
rarefied
the
opalescent
tints
more
intense
deep
purple
reflections
lay
in
the
shadows
made
by
the
rocky
points
and
there
was
a
bright
clearness
of
atmosphere
quite
unlike
the
mistiness
of
the
summer
the
cousins
sat
side
by
side
on
the
big
rock
just
where
they
had
sat
on
that
june
day
which
seemed
to
candace
so
long
ago
gertrude
was
no
longer
critical
or
scornful
she
sat
a
little
farther
back
than
candace
and
from
time
to
time
glanced
at
her
with
a
sort
of
puzzled
expression
cannie
happening
to
turn
caught
the
look
it
embarrassed
her
a
little
and
to
hide
the
embarrassment
she
began
to
talk
did
you
know
that
cousin
kate
is
going
to
let
me
live
with
you
always
she
asked
yes
mamma
told
me
is
she
good
went
on
candace
impulsively
i
can
hardly
believe
yet
that
it
is
true
what
makes
you
all
so
very
very
kind
to
me
i
ca
think
i
have
been
particularly
kind
said
gertrude
suddenly
candace
i
might
as
well
say
it
at
once
for
it
been
a
good
deal
on
my
mind
lately
i
wish
you
would
forget
how
nasty
i
was
when
you
first
came
to
us
were
you
nasty
said
candace
trying
to
speak
lightly
but
with
a
flush
creeping
into
her
face
illustration
the
cliffs
i
shall
always
love
this
rock
said
page
yes
i
was
very
nasty
i
did
care
to
have
you
come
in
the
first
place
and
i
thought
you
seemed
awkward
and
countrified
and
i
like
your
clothes
and
i
was
afraid
the
girls
here
would
laugh
at
you
it
was
a
mean
sort
of
feeling
and
the
worst
thing
is
that
i
see
that
it
was
mean
i
was
ashamed
of
you
but
now
i
am
ashamed
dreadfully
ashamed
of
myself
i
felt
so
much
wiser
and
more
knowing
than
you
then
and
yet
when
georgie
my
own
sister
got
into
this
dreadful
trouble
and
came
to
me
for
help
i
had
none
to
give
her
i
was
as
much
a
coward
as
she
was
i
gave
her
bad
advice
and
it
was
you
whom
i
laughed
at
and
was
unkind
to
who
saw
what
she
ought
to
do
and
was
brave
and
really
helped
when
i
think
of
it
all
i
feel
as
if
i
forgive
myself
why
gertrude
dear
do
cried
cannie
for
gertrude
was
almost
crying
i
do
wonder
you
did
care
for
me
at
first
i
was
dreadfully
awkward
and
stupid
and
you
never
were
nasty
to
me
do
say
such
things
but
with
a
shy
longing
to
remove
beyond
question
the
doubt
which
had
troubled
her
you
like
me
now
you
are
not
sorry
that
i
am
to
stay
and
live
with
you
sorry
no
i
am
very
very
glad
you
are
the
best
girl
i
know
it
will
do
me
heaps
of
good
to
have
you
in
the
house
oh
how
delightful
cried
cannie
now
i
have
a
thing
to
wish
for
it
is
all
nonsense
about
my
doing
you
good
but
i
am
so
glad
you
want
me
to
stay
the
two
girls
nestled
closer
and
kissed
each
other
with
a
new
sense
of
friendship
and
liking

said
candace
gertrude
began
the
downward
climb
but
candace
paused
a
moment
on
the
summit
and
turned
for
a
last
look
at
the
water
every
glittering
every
glinting
sail
seemed
to
her
to
wave
a
signal
of
glad
sympathy
and
congratulation
she
softly
whispered
but
i
shall
come
back
you
belong
to
me
now
she
kissed
her
hand
to
the
far
