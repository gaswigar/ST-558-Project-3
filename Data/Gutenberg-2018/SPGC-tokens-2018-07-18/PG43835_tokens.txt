resurrectio
præteriti
quærens
you
promised
dear
lumen
to
describe
to
me
that
supremest
of
moments
which
immediately
succeeds
death
and
to
relate
to
me
how
by
a
natural
law
singular
though
it
may
seem
you
lived
again
your
past
life
and
penetrated
a
mystery
lumen
yes
my
old
friend
i
will
now
keep
my
word
and
i
trust
that
thanks
to
the
communion
of
our
souls
you
will
be
able
to
understand
the
phenomenon
you
deem
so
strange
sidenote
life
and
death
there
are
many
conceptions
which
a
mortal
mind
finds
difficult
to
grasp
death
which
has
delivered
me
from
the
weak
and
senses
of
the
body
has
not
yet
touched
you
with
its
liberating
hand
you
still
belong
to
the
living
world
and
in
spite
of
your
isolation
in
this
retreat
of
yours
amid
the
royal
towers
of
the
faubourg
jaques
you
still
belong
to
the
life
of
earth
and
are
occupied
with
its
petty
distinctions
you
must
not
therefore
be
surprised
if
whilst
i
am
explaining
to
you
this
mystery
i
beg
of
you
to
isolate
yourself
still
further
from
outer
things
and
to
give
me
the
most
of
which
your
mind
is
capable
quærens
my
one
desire
is
to
listen
to
your
revelations
speak
therefore
without
fear
and
to
the
point
and
deign
to
acquaint
me
with
those
impressions
as
yet
to
me
unknown
which
are
experienced
upon
the
cessation
of
life
lumen
from
what
point
do
you
wish
me
to
begin
my
recital
quærens
if
you
can
recall
it
i
shall
be
pleased
if
you
will
begin
at
the
moment
when
my
trembling
hands
closed
your
eyes
sidenote
death
lumen
the
separation
of
the
thinking
principle
from
the
nervous
system
leaves
no
remembrance
it
is
as
though
the
impressions
made
upon
the
brain
which
constitute
memory
were
entirely
effaced
to
be
renewed
afterwards
in
another
form
the
first
sensation
of
identity
felt
after
death
resembles
that
which
is
felt
during
life
on
awakening
in
the
morning
when
still
confused
with
the
visions
of
the
night
the
mind
wavering
between
the
past
and
the
future
endeavours
to
recover
itself
and
at
the
same
time
to
retain
the
vanishing
dreams
the
pictures
and
events
of
which
are
still
passing
before
it
at
times
when
thus
absorbed
in
the
recollection
of
a
delightful
dream
the
eyelids
close
and
in
a
half
slumber
the
visions
reappear
it
is
thus
that
our
thinking
faculty
is
divided
at
death
between
a
reality
that
it
does
not
yet
comprehend
and
a
dream
which
has
completely
disappeared
the
most
conflicting
impressions
mingle
in
and
confuse
the
mind
and
if
overwhelmed
by
perishable
feelings
a
regret
comes
into
the
mind
for
the
world
that
has
been
left
behind
a
sense
of
indefinable
sadness
weighs
upon
and
darkens
the
imagination
and
hinders
clearness
of
vision
quærens
did
you
feel
these
sensations
immediately
after
death
sidenote
no
such
thing
as
death
sidenote
not
death
but
change
lumen
after
death
there
is
no
such
thing
as
death
what
you
call
death
the
separation
of
the
body
from
the
soul
is
not
strictly
speaking
effected
in
a
material
form
like
the
chemical
separation
of
a
combination
of
elements
such
as
one
sees
in
the
world
of
matter
one
is
no
more
conscious
of
this
final
separation
which
seems
to
you
so
cruel
than
the
babe
is
aware
of
his
birth
we
are
born
into
the
heavenly
life
as
unconsciously
as
we
were
born
into
the
earthly
only
the
soul
no
longer
enveloped
by
its
bodily
covering
acquires
more
rapidly
the
consciousness
of
its
individuality
and
of
its
powers
this
faculty
of
perception
varies
essentially
between
one
soul
and
another
there
are
those
who
during
their
earthly
life
never
lift
their
souls
toward
heaven
and
never
feel
a
desire
to
penetrate
the
laws
of
creation
these
being
still
dominated
by
fleshly
appetites
remain
long
in
a
troubled
and
state
there
are
others
whose
aspirations
have
happily
flown
upwards
towards
the
eternal
heights
to
these
the
moment
of
separation
comes
with
calmness
and
peace
they
know
that
progress
is
the
law
of
being
and
that
the
life
to
come
will
be
better
than
that
which
they
have
quitted
they
follow
step
by
step
that
lethargy
which
reaches
at
last
to
the
heart
and
when
slowly
and
insensibly
the
last
pulsation
ceases
the
departed
are
already
above
the
body
whose
falling
asleep
they
have
been
watching
freeing
themselves
from
the
magnetic
bonds
they
feel
themselves
swiftly
borne
by
an
unknown
force
toward
the
point
of
creation
to
which
their
sentiments
their
aspirations
and
their
hopes
have
drawn
them
quærens
the
conversation
into
which
i
have
drawn
you
my
dear
master
recalls
to
my
memory
the
dialogues
of
plato
on
the
immortality
of
the
soul
and
as
phædrus
asked
his
master
socrates
on
the
day
he
had
to
drink
the
hemlock
in
obedience
to
the
iniquitous
sentence
of
the
athenians
i
ask
you
you
who
have
passed
the
dread
boundary
what
is
the
essential
difference
which
distinguishes
the
soul
from
the
body
since
the
latter
dies
whilst
the
former
can
not
die
sidenote
life
viewed
scientifically
lumen
i
shall
not
imitate
socrates
by
giving
a
metaphysical
answer
to
this
question
nor
shall
i
with
the
theologians
reply
in
a
dogmatic
way
but
i
will
give
you
instead
a
scientific
answer
for
you
like
myself
accept
only
as
of
real
value
the
results
of
positive
knowledge
sidenote
renewal
of
the
body
sidenote
atoms
and
molecules
we
find
in
the
human
being
three
principles
and
yet
in
complete
the
body
the
vital
energy
the
soul
i
name
them
thus
in
order
that
i
may
follow
the
method
the
body
is
an
association
of
molecules
which
are
themselves
formed
of
groups
of
atoms
the
atoms
are
inert
passive
immutable
and
indestructible
they
enter
into
the
organism
by
means
of
respiration
and
alimentation
they
renew
the
tissues
incessantly
and
are
continually
replaced
by
others
and
when
cast
out
from
the
body
go
to
form
other
bodies
in
a
few
months
the
human
body
is
entirely
renewed
and
neither
in
the
blood
nor
in
the
flesh
nor
in
the
brain
nor
in
the
bones
does
an
atom
remain
of
those
which
constituted
the
body
a
few
months
before
the
atoms
travel
without
ceasing
from
body
to
body
chiefly
by
the
grand
medium
of
the
atmosphere
the
molecule
of
iron
is
the
same
whether
it
be
incorporated
in
the
blood
which
throbs
in
the
temples
of
an
illustrious
man
or
form
part
of
a
fragment
of
rusty
iron
the
molecule
of
oxygen
is
the
same
in
the
blush
raised
by
a
loving
glance
or
when
in
union
with
hydrogen
it
forms
the
flame
of
one
of
the
thousand
jets
of
gas
that
illuminate
paris
by
night
or
when
it
falls
from
the
clouds
in
the
shape
of
a
drop
of
water
the
bodies
of
the
living
are
formed
of
the
ashes
of
the
dead
and
if
all
the
dead
were
to
be
resuscitated
the
last
comers
might
find
the
material
for
their
bodies
wanting
owing
to
their
predecessors
having
appropriated
all
that
was
available
moreover
during
life
many
exchanges
are
made
between
enemies
and
friends
between
men
animals
and
plants
which
amaze
the
analyst
who
looks
at
them
with
the
eyes
of
science
that
which
you
breathe
eat
and
drink
has
been
breathed
drunk
and
eaten
millions
of
times
before
such
is
the
human
body
an
assemblage
of
molecules
of
matter
which
are
constantly
being
renewed
the
principle
by
which
these
molecules
are
grouped
according
to
a
certain
form
so
as
to
produce
an
organism
is
the
vital
energy
of
life
the
inert
passive
atoms
incapable
of
guiding
themselves
are
ruled
by
vital
force
which
calls
them
makes
them

of

and
disposes
of
them

older
than

of
twenty
since
the

of
which
his

is
composed
have
only
belonged
to
his
frame
a
few
months
and
since
atoms
are
neither
old
nor
young
the
constituent
elements
of
his
body
when
analysed
have
no
age
and
what
is
old
in
him
is
solely
his
vital
energy
which
is
but
one
of
the
forms
of
the
general

of
the

and
which
in
his
case
has

life

and
as
it
were
unconsciously
it

it
is
an
unconscious

which
organises
and

which

in
which
the

of

it
has
no

it
does
not
grow

it
is
not
changed
in
a
few
months
like
the
body
for
after

dozens
of
years
we
feel
that
we
have
preserved

identity
that
our
ourself
is
always

hand
if
the
soul
did
not
exist
and
if
the
faculty
of
thinking
were
only
a
function
of
the
brain
we
should
no
longer
be
able
to
say
that
a
body
for
it
would
be
our
body
our
brain
would
have
besides
from
time
to
time
our
consciousness
would
change
we
should
no
longer
have
a
feeling
of
identity
and
we
should
no
longer
be
responsible
for
the
resolutions
secreted
by
the
molecules
which
had
passed
through
the
brain
many
months
before
the

is
not

for
that
is
limited
and
is
transmitted
by

no
consciousness
of
itself
is
born
grows
up

and
dies
all
these
states
are
opposed
to
those
of
the
soul
which
is
immaterial
unlimited
not
transmissible
conscious
sidenote
the
soul
has
no
limits
the
development
of
the
vital
force
may
be
represented
geometrically
by
a
spindle
which
swells
out
gradually
to
the
middle
and
decreases
again
to
a
point
when
the
soul
reaches
the
middle
of
life
it
does
not
become
less
like
a
spindle
and
dwindle
down
to
the
end
but
follows
its
parabolic
curve
into
the
infinite
moreover
the
mode
of
existence
of
the
soul
is
essentially
different
from
that
of
the
vital
force
it
lives
in
a
spiritual
way
the
conceptions
of
the
soul
such
as
the
sentiments
of
justice
or
injustice
of
truth
or
falsehood
of
good
and
evil
as
well
as
knowledge
mathematics
analysis
synthesis
contemplation
admiration
love
affection
or
hatred
esteem
or
contempt
in
a
word
the
occupations
of
the
soul
whatever
they
may
be
are
of
an
intellectual
and
moral
order
which
neither
the
atoms
nor
the
physical
forces
can
apprehend
and
which
have
as
real
an
existence
as
the
physical
order
of
things
the
chemical
or
mechanical
work
of
cerebral
cells
however
subtle
they
may
be
can
never
produce
an
intellectual
judgment
such
for
instance
as
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
four
multiplied
by
four
is
equal
to
sixteen
or
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal

in

supreme
principles
of

of

of
goodness
the
soul
can
be
attached
to
the
body
only
by
means
of
the
vital
force
when
life
is
extinct
the
soul
naturally
separates
from
the
organism
and
ceases
to
have
any
immediate
connection
with
time
and
space
after
death
the
soul
remains
in
that
part
of
the
universe
where
the
earth
happens
to
be
at
the
moment
of
its
separation
from
the
body
you
know
that
the
earth
is
a
planet
in
the
heavens
like
venus
and
jupiter
the
earth
continues
to
run
in
its
orbit
at
the
rate
of
kilometres
an
hour
so
that
the
soul
an
hour
after
death
is
at
that
distance
from
its
body
because
of
its
immobility
in
space
when
no
longer
subject
to
the
laws
of
matter
thus
we
are
in
the
heavens
immediately
after
death
where
however
we
have
also
been
during
the
whole
of
our
lives
but
we
then
had
weight
which
held
us
to
the
earth
i
must
add
however
that
as
a
rule
the
soul
takes
some
time
to
disengage
itself
from
the
nervous
organism
and
that
it
occasionally
remains
many
days
and
even
many
months
magnetically
connected
with
the
old
body
which
it
is
reluctant
to
forsake
moreover
it
has
special
faculties
by
means
of
which
it
can
transport
itself
from
one
point
of
space
to
another
quærens
now
for
the
first
time
i
am
able
to
understand
death
as
a
natural
process
and
to
comprehend
the
individual
existence
of
the
soul
its
independence
of
the
body
and
of
life
its
personality
its
survival
and
its
obvious
position
in
the
universe
this
synthetic
theory
has
prepared
me
i
hope
to
understand
and
appreciate
your
revelation
but
you
said
that
a
singular
event
struck
you
on
your
entrance

that

well
my
dear
friend
let
me
go
on
with
my
story
midnight
had
just
struck
you
will
remember
on
the
sonorous
bell
of
my
old
timepiece
and
the
full
moon
shed
its
pale
light
on
my
dying
bed
when
my
daughter
my
grandson
and
other
friends
withdrew
to
take
some
rest
you
wished
to
remain
with
me
and
you
promised
my
daughter
not
to
leave
me
till
the
morning
i
would
thank
you
for
your
warm
and
tender
devotion
if
we
were
not
so
truly
brothers
we
had
been
alone
about
for
the
star
of
night
was
declining
when
i
took
your
hand
and
told
you
that
life
had
already
abandoned
my
extremities
you
assured
me
that
it
was
not
so
but
i
was
calmly
observing
my
physiological
state
and
i
knew
that
in
a
few
moments
i
should
cease
to
breathe
you
moved
gently
towards
the
room
where
my
children
were
sleeping
but
concentrating
my
powers
by
an
extreme
effort
i
stopped
you
returning
with
tears
in
your
eyes
you
said
to
me
you
are
right
you
have
given
them
your
last
wishes
and
morning
will
be
time
enough
to
send
for
them
there
was
in
these
words
a
contradiction
that
i
felt
without
expressing
it
to
you
do
you
remember
that
then
i
asked
you
to
open
the
window
it
was
a
beautiful
night
in
october
more
beautiful
than
those
of
the
scottish
bards
sung
by
ossian
not
far
from
the
horizon
just
level
with
my
eyes
i
could
distinguish
the
pleiades
veiled
by
mist
whilst
castor
and
pollux
floated
triumphantly
a
little
higher
up
above
forming
a
triangle
with
them
shone
the
beautiful
star
with
rays
of
gold
which
on
maps
of
the
zodiac
is
marked
capella
you
see
how
clearly
i
remember
it
all
when
you
had
opened
the
window
the
perfume
of
the
roses
sleeping
under
the
wings
of
night
ascended
upwards
to
me
and
mingled
with
the
silent
rays
of
the
stars
i
can
not
express
to
you
how
sweet
were
these
last
impressions
that
i
received
from
the
earth
language
fails
me
to
describe
what
i
felt
in
the
hours
of
my
sweetest
happiness
of
my
tenderest
love
i
never
felt
such
an
intensity
of
joy
so
glorious
a
serenity
such
real
bliss
as
i
experienced
then
in
the
ecstatic
enjoyment
of
the
perfumed
breath
of
the
flowers
and
the
tender
gleam
of
the
distant
stars
when
you
bent
over
me
i
seemed
to
return
to
the
outer
world
and
with
my
hands
clasped
over
my
breast
my
sight
and
my
thoughts
united
in
prayer
together
took
flight
into
space
before
my
ears
closed
for
ever
i
heard
the
last
words
as
they
fell
from
my
lips
adieu
my
old
friend
i
feel
that
death
is
bearing
me
away
to
those
unknown
regions
where
i
trust
we
shall
one
day
meet
when
the
dawn
effaces
these
stars
only
my
mortal
body
will
be
here
repeat
then
to
my
daughter
my
last
wish
to
bring
up
her
children
in
the
contemplation
of
the
eternal
goodness
and
whilst
you
wept
as
you
knelt
by
my
bed
i
added
recite
the
beautiful
prayer
of
jesus
and
you
began
with
trembling
voice
our
father
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
that
trespass
against
us
these
were
the
last
thoughts
that
passed
through
my
soul
by
means
of
the
senses
my
sight
grew
dim
as
i
looked
at
the
star
capella
and
immediately
i
became
unconscious
sidenote
time
does
not
exist
outside
the
earth
years
days
and
hours
are
constituted
by
the
movements
of
the
earth
in
space
outside
these
movements
time
not
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
have
any
notion
of
time
i
think
however
that
the
event
i
am
now
going
to
describe
to
you
occurred
on
the
very
day
of
my
death
for
as
you
will
see
presently
my
body
was
not
yet
buried
when
this
vision
appeared
to
my
soul
sidenote
sight
of
the
soul
in
the
heavens
as
i
was
born
in
i
was
then
in
in
my
year
so
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
myself
animated
by
a
vivacity
of
mind
as
ardent
as
in
the
prime
of
my
life
i
had
no
body
and
yet
i
was
not
incorporeal
i
felt
and
saw
that
i
was
constituted
of
a
substance
which
however
bore
no
analogy
to
the
material
form
of
terrestrial
bodies
i
know
not
how
i
traversed
the
celestial
spaces
but
by
some
unknown
force
i
soon
found
that
i
was
approaching
a
magnificent
golden
sun
the
splendour
of
which
did
not
however
dazzle
me
i
perceived
that
it
was
surrounded
by
a
number
of
worlds
each
enveloped
in
one
or
more
rings
by
the
same
unconscious
force
i
was
driven
towards
one
of
these
rings
and
was
a
spectator
of
the
marvellous
phenomena
of
light
for
the
starry
spaces
were
crossed
everywhere
by
rainbow
bridges
i
lost
sight
of
the
golden
sun
and
i
found
myself
in
a
sort
of
night
coloured
with
hues
of
a
thousand
shades
the
sight
of
my
soul
far
exceeded
that
of
my
body
and
to
my
surprise
this
power
of
sight
appeared
to
be
subject
to
my
will
the
sight
of
the
soul
is
so
marvellous
that
i
must
not
stop
to
describe
it
suffice
it
to
say
that
instead
of
seeing
the
stars
in
the
heavens
as
you
see
them
on
the
earth
i
could
distinguish
clearly
the
worlds
revolving
round
each
other
and
strange
to
say
when
i
desired
to
examine
more
closely
these
worlds
and
to
avoid
the
brilliance
of
the
central
sun
it
disappeared
from
my
sight
and
left
me
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
observing
any
one
of
them
i
wished
further
when
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
one
particular
world
i
could
distinguish
its
continents
and
its
seas
its
clouds
and
its
rivers
although
they
did
not
appear
to
become
larger
as
objects
seen
through
a
telescope
do
i
saw
any
special
thing
that
i
fixed
my
sight
upon
such
as
a
town
or
a
tract
of
country
with
perfect
clearness
and
distinctness
sidenote
the
soul
clothed
in
a
new
body
when
i
reached
this
ringed
world
i
found
myself
clothed
in
a
form
like
that
of
its
inhabitants
it
appeared
that
my
soul
had
attracted
to
itself
the
constituent
atoms
of
a
new
body
living
bodies
on
the
earth
are
composed
of
molecules
which
do
not
touch
one
another
and
which
are
constantly
renewed
by
respiration
by
nutrition
and
by
assimilation
the
envelope
of
the
soul
is
formed
more
quickly
in
that
world
i
felt
myself
more
alive
than
the
supernatural
beings
whose
passions
and
sorrows
dante
celebrates
one
of
the
special
faculties
of
this
new
world
is
that
of
seeing
very
far
quærens
but
pardon
a
rather
simple
remark
is
it
not
likely
that
the
worlds
or
planets
that
revolve
round
each
star
must
mingle
in
a
distant
view
with
their
central
sun
for
instance
when
you
see
our
sun
from
afar
with
the
planets
of
his
system
is
it
possible
for
you
to
distinguish
our
earth
amongst
them
sidenote
the
soul
powers
of
vision
lumen
you
have
raised
the
single
geometrical
objection
which
seems
to
contradict
all
previous
experience
in
point
of
fact
at
a
certain
distance
the
planets
are
absorbed
in
their
suns
and
our
terrestrial
eyes
would
have
difficulty
in
distinguishing
them
you
know
that
from
saturn
the
earth
is
invisible
but
you
must
remember
that
this
discrepancy
arises
as
much
from
the
imperfection
of
our
sight
as
from
the
geometrical
law
of
the
decrease
of
surfaces
now
in
the
world
on
which
i
had
just
landed
the
inhabitants
are
not
incarnated
in
a
gross
form
as
we
are
here
below
but
are
free
beings
and
endowed
with
eminently
powerful
faculties
of
perception
they
can
as
i
have
told
you
the
source
of
light
from
the
object
lighted
and
moreover
they
can
perceive
distinctly
details
which
at
that
distance
would
be
absolutely
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
those
dwelling
upon
this
earth
quærens
do
they
make
use
then
of
instruments
superior
to
our
telescopes
lumen
well
if
in
order
to
realise
this
marvellous
faculty
you
find
it
easier
to
suppose
that
they
possess
such
instruments
you
may
do
so
in
theory
imagine
a
telescope
which
by
a
succession
of
lenses
and
an
arrangement
of
diaphragms
brings
near
in
succession
these
distant
worlds
and
isolates
each
one
in
the
field
of
view
in
order
to
study
it
separately
i
should
also
inform
you
that
these
beings
are
endowed
with
a
special
sense
by
which
they
can
regulate
at
will
the
powers
of
their
marvellous
organs
of
sight
and
you
must
further
understand
that
this
power
and
this
regulation
of
vision
are
natural
in
those
worlds
and
not
supernatural
in
order
to
conceive
of
the
faculties
possessed
by
these
beings
reflect
for
a
moment
upon
the
eyes
of
some
insects
of
those
for
instance
which
have
the
power
to
draw
in
to
lengthen
out
or
to
flatten
the
crystalline
lens
so
as
to
make
it
magnify
in
different
degrees
or
of
those
which
can
concentrate
on
the
field
of
view
a
multitude
of
eyes
in
order
to
bring
them
to
bear
upon
the
desired
object
quærens
yes
i
can
imagine
it
to
be
possible
then
you
are
able
to
see
the
earth
and
to
distinguish
from
above
even
the
towns
and
villages
of
our
lower
world
sidenote
lumen
on
a
star
world
lumen
let
me
proceed
with
my
description
i
found
myself
then
upon
the
world
the
size
of
which
i
told
you
is
great
enough
to
make
two
hundred
worlds
like
yours
the
mountain
on
which
i
stood
was
covered
with
trees
woven
into
arboreal
palaces
these
chateaux
seemed
to
me
either
to
grow
naturally
or
else
to
be
produced
by
a
skilful
arrangement
of
branches
and
of
tall
flowering
plants
the
town
where
i
entered
it
was
thickly
peopled
and
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
i
noticed
a
group
of
old
men
twenty
or
thirty
in
number
who
were
looking
with
the
most
fixed
and
anxious
attention
at
a
beautiful
star
in
the
southern
constellation
of
the
altar
on
the
confines
of
the
milky
way
they
did
not
observe
my
arrival
amongst
them
so
absorbed
were
they
in
observing
and
examining
this
star
or
perhaps
one
of
the
worlds
belonging
to
its
system
sidenote
lumen
learns
the
language
of
spirits
as
for
myself
i
became
aware
on
arriving
in
this
atmosphere
that
i
was
clothed
in
a
body
resembling
that
of
its
inhabitants
and
to
my
still
greater
surprise
i
heard
these
old
men
speaking
of
the
earth
yes
of
the
earth
in
that
universal
which
all
beings
comprehend
from
the
seraphim
to
the
trees
of
the
forest
and
not
only
were
they
talking
about
the
earth
but
about
france
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
these
legal
massacres
they
said
is
it
possible
that
brute
force
reigns
supreme
there
will
civil
war
decimate
these
people
and
will
rivers
of
blood
run
in
this
capital
at
one
time
so
magnificent
and
so
gay
i
could
not
follow
the
drift
of
this
speech
i
who
had
just
come
from
the
earth
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
and
who
but
yesterday
had
breathed
in
the
heart
of
this
tranquil
and
peaceful
capital
i
joined
the
group
fixing
my
eyes
as
they
did
on
the
beautiful
star
and
i
tried
at
the
same
time
to
understand
what
they
were
talking
about
presently
i
saw
to
the
left
of
the
star
a
sphere
that
was
the
earth
sidenote
the
solar
system
in
the
heavens
you
are
aware
my
friend
that
notwithstanding
the
apparent
paradox
the
earth
is
really
a
star
in
the
sky
as
i
reminded
you
just
now
seen
from
one
of
the
stars
comparatively
near
to
your
system
it
appears
to
the
spiritual
sight
of
which
i
have
told
you
like
a
family
of
stars
composed
of
eight
principal
worlds
crowding
round
the
sun
which
is
itself
reduced
to
a
star
jupiter
and
saturn
first
arrest
the
attention
because
of
their
great
size
then
one
notices
uranus
and
neptune
and
at
length
quite
near
to
the
mars
and
the
earth
venus
is
very
difficult
to
make
out
mercury
remains
invisible
because
of
its
too
great
proximity
to
the
sun
such
is
the
appearance
of
the
planetary
system
in
the
heavens
sidenote
the
earth
as
seen
from
the
heavens
my
attention
was
fixed
exclusively
on
the
little
terrestrial
sphere
by
the
side
of
which
i
perceived
the
moon
i
soon
remarked
the
white
snow
of
the
north
pole
the
yellow
triangle
of
africa
and
the
outlines
of
the
ocean
whilst
my
attention
was
concentrated
on
our
planet
the
became
eclipsed
before
my
eyes
then
i
was
able
to
distinguish
in
the
midst
of
an
expanse
of
azure
a
brown
cleft
or
hollow
and
pursuing
my
investigations
i
discovered
a
town
in
the
midst
of
this
cleft
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
that
this
continental
hollow
was
france
and
that
the
town
was
paris
the
first
sign
by
which
i
recognised
it
was
the
silver
ribbon
of
the
seine
that
describes
so
many
graceful
convolutions
to
the
west
of
the
great
town
by
the
use
of
my
new
optical
organs
i
could
see
it
in
detail
at
the
eastern
side
of
the
city
i
saw
the
nave
and
towers
of
notre
dame
in
the
form
of
a
latin
cross
the
boulevards
wound
round
the
north
to
the
south
i
recognised
the
gardens
of
the
luxembourg
and
the
observatory
the
cupola
of
the
pantheon
covered
like
a
grey
hood
the
mount
of
ste
geneviève
to
the
west
the
grand
avenue
of
the
formed
a
straight
line
farther
on
i
could
distinguish
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
environs
of
st
cloud
the
wood
of
meudon
sèvres
ville
and
montretout
sidenote
paris
the
whole
scene
was
lighted
up
by
splendid
sunshine
but
strange
to
say
the
hills
were
covered
with
snow
as
in
the
month
of
january
whilst
i
had
left
it
in
october
when
the
country
was
perfectly
green
i
was
fully
convinced
that
i
was
looking
at
paris
but
as
i
could
not
understand
the
exclamations
of
my
companions
i
endeavoured
to
ascertain
more
details
sidenote
old
paris
sidenote
no
arc
de

visible
sidenote
no
column
vendôme
sidenote
no
obelisk
in
the

my
eyes
were
fixed
with
most
interest
upon
the
observatory
it
was
my
favourite
quarter
and
for
forty
years
i
had
scarcely
left
it
for
more
than
a
few
months
judge
therefore
of
my
surprise
when
i
came
to
look
more
closely
at
it
to
find
that
the
magnificent
avenue
of
chestnuts
between
the
luxembourg
and
the
observatory
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
that
in
its
place
were
the
gardens
of
convents
my
indignation
as
an
artist
was
aroused
against
these
municipal
misdeeds
but
it
was
quickly
suspended
by
still
stranger
feelings
i
beheld
a
monastery
in
the
midst
of
our
beautiful
orchard
the
boulevard
michel
did
not
exist
nor
did
the
rue
de
medici
instead
i
saw
a
confused
mass
of
little
streets
and
i
seemed
to
recognise
the
former
rue
de
and
the
place
michel
where
an
ancient
fountain
used
to
supply
water
to
the
people
of
the
faubourg
and
i
made
out
a
number
of
narrow
lanes
which
existed
long
ago
the
cupolas
and
the
two
side
wings
of
the
observatory
had
disappeared
by
degrees
as
i
continued
my
observations
i
discovered
that
paris
was
indeed
much
changed
the
arc
de
triomphe
de
and
all
the
brilliant
avenues
that
meet
there
had
disappeared
there
was
no
boulevard
de
sébastopol
no
station
de
nor
any
other
station
and
no
railway
the
tower
of
jaques
was
enclosed
in
a
court
of
old
houses
and
the
column
of
victory
was
reached
that
way
the
column
of
the
bastile
was
also
absent
for
i
should
easily
have
recognised
the
figure
upon
it
an
equestrian
statue
filled
the
place
of
the
vendôme
column
the
rue
castiglione
was
an
old
green
convent
the
rue
de
rivoli
had
disappeared
the
louvre
was
either
unfinished
or
partly
pulled
down
between
the
court
of
francis
and
the
tuileries
there
were
old
hovels
there
was
no
obelisk
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
but
i
saw
a
moving
crowd
though
i
was
unable
at
first
to
distinguish
the
figures
the
madeleine
and
the
rue
royal
were
invisible
behind
the
isle
of
louis
i
saw
a
small
island
instead
of
the
outer
boulevards
there
was
only
an
old
wall
and
the
whole
was
enclosed
by
fortifications
in
short
although
i
recognised
the
capital
of
france
by
some
familiar
buildings
i
was
aware
of
a
marvellous
metamorphosis
which
had
completely
changed
its
aspect
sidenote
time
merely
relative
at
first
i
fancied
that
in

having
just
come
from

i
must
have
been
many
years
as
the
notion
of
time
is
essentially
relative
and
there
is
nothing
real
or
absolute
in
the
measure
of
duration
having
once
left
the
earth
i
had
lost
all
standard
of
measure
and
i
said
to
myself
that
years
centuries
indeed
might
have
passed
over
my
head
without
my
perceiving
it
and
that
the
time
had
seemed
short
to
me
because
of
the
great
interest
i
had
taken
in
my
aerial
voyage
a
commonplace
idea
which
shows
how
merely
relative
is
our
notion
of
time
not
having
any
means
of
assuring
myself
of
the
facts
of
the
case
i
should
undoubtedly
have
concluded
that
i
was
separated
by
many
centuries
from
the
terrestrial
life
which
was
now
going
on
before
my
eyes
in
paris
and
i
imagined
that
i
saw
the
period
of
the
twentieth
or
century
until
i
penetrated
more
deeply
into
the
details
of
the
life
picture
and
examined
all
its
features
eventually
i
succeeded
in
identifying
the
aspect
of
the
town
and
i
gradually
recognised
the
sites
of
the
streets
and
of
the
public
buildings
which
i
had
known
in
my
early
youth
the
hôtel
de

appeared
to
be
decorated
with
flags
and
i
could
distinguish
the
square

dome
of
the
tuileries

a
scene
in
his
past
life
a
little
further
examination
recalled
everything
to
me
and
then
i
saw
in
an
old
convent
garden
a
which
made
me
tremble
with
joy
it
was
in
that
spot
that
i
met
in
my
youth
the
woman
who
loved
me
so
deeply
my
sylvia
so
tender
and
so
devoted
who
gave
up
everything
to
unite
her
life
to
mine
i
saw
the
little
cupola
of
the
terrace
where
we
loved
to
saunter
in
the
evenings
and
to
study
the
constellations
oh
with
what
joy
i
greeted
those
promenades
where
we
had
walked
keeping
step
with
one
another
those
avenues
where
we
took
refuge
from
the
curious
eyes
of
intruders
you
can
fancy
how
as
i
looked
at
this
the
sight
of
it
alone
was
enough
to
assure
me
absolutely
and
convincingly
that
i
had
before
my
eyes
not
as
it
was
natural
to
suppose
the
paris
of
long

but
in
reality
the
paris
the
old
paris
of
the
beginning
of
this
century
or
of
the
end
of

century
but
in
spite
of
all
you
can
easily
imagine
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
it
seemed
so
much
more
natural
to
think
that
paris
had
grown
old
and
had
suffered
these
transformations
since
my
departure
from
the
earth
an
interval
of
time
absolutely
unknown
to
me
it
was
so
much
easier
to
think
that

continued
my
observations
carefully
in
order
to
ascertain
if
it
was
really

my

companions
were
rising
and
entering
into
conversation
in
groups
i
asked
him
to
describe
the
situation
to
me

informed
me
that

gifted
by

with
the

order
of
their
inhabitants
moreover
when
a
great
disturbance
takes
place
either
in
the
physical
or
the
moral
realm
they
feel
a
sort
of
inner
agitation

themselves

by

with

had
beheld
the

liberty

it

trembled
for

felt
doubtful
of

emancipated

confess

you

i
could
no
longer
be
in
any
doubt

it

this
explanation
was
anticipated
by
the
fact

the
old
men
of

had
preceded
me
in
observing
these
phenomena

they
had
seen

analysed

on
them

knowing
anything

assured

before

with

to

you
shall
have
an
astronomical
explanation
of
them
in
the
first
place
i
examined
the
position
of
the
earth
in
the
constellation
of
the
altar
as
i
have
told
you
i
took
the
bearings
of
my
position
relatively
to
the
polar
star
and
to
the
zodiac
i
remarked
that
the
constellations
were
not
very
different
from
those
we
see
from
the
earth
and
that
except
in
the
case
of
a
few
particular
stars
their
positions
were
evidently
the
same
orion
still
reigned
in
the
region
the
great
bear
pursuing
his
circular
course
still
pointing
to
the
north
in
comparing
the
apparent
movements
and
them
scientifically
i
calculated
that
the
point
where
i
saw
the
group
of
the
sun
the
earth
and
the
planets
marked
the
hour
of
right
ascension
that
is
to
say
about
the
degree
or
nearly
so
i
had
no
instrument
to
take
exact
measurements
i
observed
in
the
second
place
that
it
was
on
the
degree
from
the
south
pole
i
made
these
observations
to
ascertain
the
star
on
which
i
then
was
and
i
was
led
to
conclude
that
i
was
on
a
star
situated
on
the
degree
of
right
ascension
and
the
degree
of
north
declination
on
the
other
hand
i
knew
from
the
words
of
the
old
man
that
the
star
on
which
we
were
was
not
far
from
our
sun
since
he
considered
it
to
be
one
of
the
neighbouring
stars
from
these
data
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recalling
the
star
that
stands
in
the
position
i
had
determined
one
only
answered
to
it
that
of
the
first
magnitude
alpha
in
the
constellation
of
auriga
named
also
or
the
there
was
no
doubt
about
this
thus
i
was
certain
that
i
was
on
one
of
the
planetary
worlds
of
the
sun
capella
from
thence
our
sun
looks
like
a
simple
star
and
appears
in
perspective
to
be
in
the
constellation
of
the
altar
just
opposite
that
of
auriga
as
seen
from
the
earth
then
i
tried
to
remember
what
was
the
parallax
of
this
star
i
recalled
that
a
friend
of
mine
a
russian
astronomer
had
made
a
calculation
which
had
been
confirmed
of
this
parallax
it
was
proved
to
be
when
i
had
thus
solved
the
mystery
my
heart
beat
with
joy
every
geometrician
knows
that
parallax
indicates
mathematically
the
distance
in
units
of
the
magnitude
employed
in
the
calculation
i
sought
then
to
recall
exactly
the
distance
which
separated
this
star
from
the
earth
in
order
to
prove
the
accuracy
of
the
calculation
i
only
needed
to
find
out
what
number
corresponded
to
sidenote
the
velocity
of
light
expressed
in
millions
of
leagues
this
number
is
and
so
from
the
star
on
which
i
was
the
earth
was
distant
billions
thousand
millions
of
leagues
the
principle
was
thus
established
and
the
problem
was
three
parts
solved
now
here
is
the
main
point
to
which
i
call
your
special
attention
for
you
will
find
in
it
an
explanation
of
the
most
marvellous
realities
light
you
know
does
not
cross
instantaneously
from
one
place
to
another
but
in
successive
waves
if
you
throw
a
stone
into
a
pool
of
tranquil
water

series
of
undulations
form
around
the
point
where
the
stone
fell
in
the
same
way
sound
undulates
in
the
air
when
passing
from
one
point
to
another
and
thus
also
light
travels
in
space
it
is
transmitted
in
successive
undulations
the
light
of
a
star
takes
a
certain
time
to
reach
the
earth
and
this
time
naturally
depends
on
the
distance
which
separates
the
star
from
the
earth

after

of
a

this
human
thunder
in
five
minutes

travels
with
much
greater
swiftness
but
it
is
not
transmitted
instantaneously
as
the
ancients
supposed
it
travels
at
the
rate
of
kilometres
per
second
and
if
it
could
revolve
might
encircle
the
earth
eight
times

to

therefore
we
see
the
heavenly
bodies
not
as
they
are
at
the
moment
we
observe
them
but
as
they
were
when
the
luminous

reaches
us

them

of
the
worlds
i
have
named
we
should
not
see
the
flames
in
the
moon
till
a
second
and
a
quarter
had
elapsed
if
in
jupiter
not
till
minutes
in
uranus
two
hours
after
and
we
should
not
see
it
in
neptune
till
four
hours
after
the
eruption
the
distances
are
incomparably
more
vast
outside
our
planetary
system
and
the
light
is
still
longer
in
reaching
us
thus
a
luminous
ray
coming
from
the
star
nearest
to
us
alpha
in
centaurus
takes
four
years
in
coming
a
ray
from
sirius
is
nearly
ten
years
in
crossing
the
abyss
which
separates
us
from
that
sun
the
star
capella
being
the
distance
above
mentioned
from
the
earth
it
is
easy
to
calculate
at
the
rate
of
kilometres
the
second
what
time
is
needed
to
cross
this
distance
the
calculation
amounts
to
years
eight
months
and
days
the
luminous
ray
therefore
which
came
from
capella
to
the
earth
traversed
space
without
interruption
years
eight
months
and
days
before
it
was
visible
on
the
earth
in
like
manner
the
ray
of
light
which
leaves
the
earth
can
only
arrive
at
capella
in
the
same
period
of
time
sidenote
time
occupied
in
the
transmission
of
light
quærens
if
the
luminous
ray
which
comes
from
that
star
takes
nearly
years
to
reach
us
it
follows
that
we
see
the
star
as
it
was
nearly
years
ago
lumen
you
are
quite
right
and
this
is
the
fact
that
i
want
you
take
note
of
specially
sidenote
a
belated
courier
quærens
in
other
words
the
ray
of
light
is
like
a
courier
who
brings
despatches
from
a
distant
country
and
having
been
nearly
years
on
the
way
his
news
is
of
events
that
occurred
at
the
time
of
his
departure
years
ago
lumen
you
have
divined
the
mystery
your
illustration
shows
me
that
you
have
lifted
the
veil
which
shrouded
it
in
order
to
be
still
more
exact
the
light
represents
a
courier
who
brings
not
written
news
but
photographs
or
strictly
speaking
real
of
the
country
from
whence
he
came
we
see
this
living
picture
such
as
it
appeared
in
all
its
aspects
at
the
moment
when
the
luminous
rays
shot
forth
from
the
distant
orb
nothing
is
more
simple
nothing
more
indubitable
when
we
examine
the
surface
of
a
star
with
a
telescope
we
see
not
the
actual
surface
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
our
observation
but
such
as
it
was
when
the
light
was
emitted
from
that
surface
quærens
this
being
so
if
a
star
the
light
of
which
takes
ten
years
to
reach
us
were
to
be
annihilated
we
should
continue
to
see
it
for
ten
years
since
its
last
ray
would
not
reach
us
before
ten
years
had
elapsed
sidenote
we
see
the
past
not
the
present
aspect
of
the
stars
lumen
it
is
precisely
so
in
short
the
rays
of
light
that
proceed
from
the
stars
do
not
reach
us
instantaneously
but
occupy
a
certain
time
in
crossing
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
them
and
show
us
those
stars
not
as
they
are
now
but
such
as
they
were
at
the
moment
in
which
those
rays
set
out
to
transmit
the
aspect
of
the
stars
to
us
thus
we
behold
a
wondrous
of
the
past
into
the
in
the
star
we
observe
we
see
the
past
which
has
already
disappeared
while
to
the
observer
it
is
the
present
the
actual
strictly
speaking
the
past
of
the
star
is
positively
the
present
of
the
observer
as
the
aspect
of
the
worlds
change
from
year
to
year
almost
from
day
to
day
one
can
imagine
these
aspects
emerging
into
space
and
advancing
into
the
infinite
and
thus
revealing
their
phases
in
the
sight
of
spectators
each
aspect
or
appearance
is
followed
by
another
and
so
on
in
endless
sequence
thus
a
series
of
undulations
bears
from
afar
the
past
history
of
the
worlds
which
the
observer
sees
in
its
various
phases
as
they
successively
reach
him
the
events
which
we
see
in
the
stars
at
present
are
already
past
and
that
which
is
actually
happening
there
we
can
not
as
yet
see
realise
to
yourself
my
friend
this
presentation
of
an
actual
fact
for
it
is
of
importance
to
you
to
comprehend
the
precession
of
the
waves
of
light
and
to
understand
the
essential
nature
of
this
undoubted
truth
the
appearance
of
things
borne
to
us
by
light
shows
us
those
things
not
as
they
are
at
present
but
as
they
were
in
that
period
of
the
past
which
preceded
the
interval
of
time
needed
for
the
light
to
traverse
the
distance
which
separates
us
from
those
events
we
do
not
see
any
of
the
stars
such
as
they
are
but
such
as
they
were
when
the
luminous
rays
that
reach
us
left
them
sidenote
the
planet
earth
as
seen
from
afar
is
not
the
actual
condition
of
the
heavens
that
is
visible
but
their
past
moreover
there
are
distant
stars
which
have
been
extinct
for
ten
thousand
years
but
which
we
can
see
still
because
the
rays
of
light
from
them
had
set
out
before
they
were
extinguished
some
of
the
double
stars
the
nature
and
movements
of
which
we
seek
with
care
and
toil
ceased
to
exist
long
before
astronomers
began
to
make
observations
if
the
visible
heavens
were
to
be
annihilated
we
should
still
see
stars
even
next
year
and
for
a
hundred
years
a
thousand
years
and
even
for
fifty
and
a
hundred
thousand
years
or
more
with
the
exception
only
of
the
nearest
stars
which
would
disappear
successively
as
the
time
needed
for
their
luminous
rays
to
reach
us
expired
alpha
of
centaur
would
go
out
first
in
four
years
sirius
in
ten
years
and
so
on
now
my
friend
you
can
easily
apply
a
scientific
theory
in
explanation
of
these
strange
facts
of
which
i
was
witness
if
from
the
earth
one
sees
the
star
capella
not
as
it
is
at
the
moment
of
observation
but
as
it
was
years
before
in
the
same
way
from
capella
one
would
see
the
earth
as
it
was
years
earlier
for
light
takes
the
same
time
to
traverse
the
distance
either
way
quærens
master
i
have
followed
your
explanation
attentively
but
i
ask
you
does
the
earth
shine
like
a
star
surely
she
is
not
luminous
sidenote
the
other
planets
seen
from
afar
lumen
she
reflects
in
space
the
light
of
the
sun
the
greater
the
distance
the
more
our
planet
resembles
a
star
all
the
light
that
radiates
from
the
sun
on
its
surface
is
condensed
into
a
disc
that
becomes
smaller
and
smaller
seen
from
the
moon
our
earth
appears
fourteen
times
more
luminous
than
the
full
moon
because
she
is
fourteen
times
larger
than
the
moon
seen
from
the
planet
venus
the
earth
appears
as
bright
as
jupiter
appears
to
us
from
the
planet
mars
the
earth
is
the
morning
and
the
evening
star
presenting
phases
like
those
of
venus
to
us
thus
although
our
earth
is
not
luminous
herself
she
shines
afar
like
the
moon
and
the
planets
by
the
light
that
she
receives
from
the
sun
and
reflects
into
space
now
the
events
taking
place
on
neptune
if
seen
from
the
earth
would
have
a
delay
of
four
hours
in
like
manner
the
view
of
life
on
the
earth
could
only
reach
neptune
in
the
same
time
nearly
years
therefore
separate
capella
and
the
earth
quærens
although
these
views
are
new
and
strange
to
me
i
now
understand
perfectly
how
since
the
light
was
nearly
years
in
traversing
the
abyss
which
separates
the
earth
from
capella
you
beheld
not
the
earth
as
it
was
in
october
the
date
of
your
death
but
as
it
appeared
in
january
and
i
comprehend
quite
as
clearly
that
what
you
saw
was
neither
a
phenomenon
of
memory
nor
a
supernatural
experience
but
an
actual
positive
and
incontestable
fact
and
that
in
very
truth
what
had
long
passed
away
on
the
earth
was
only
then
present
to
an
observer
at
that
distance
but
permit
me
to
ask
you
an
incidental
question
in
coming
from
the
earth
to
capella
did
you
cross
that
distance
even
more
quickly
than
light
sidenote
thought
swifter
than
light
lumen
have
i
not
already
anticipated
your
question
in
telling
you
that
i
crossed
this
distance
with
the
swiftness
of
thought
on
the
very
day
of
my
death
i
found
myself
on
this
star
which
i
had
admired
and
loved
so
much
all
my
life
on
the
terrestrial
globe
quærens
ah
master
although
everything
is
thus
explained
your
vision
is
not
the
less
wonderful
truly
it
is
an
astonishing
phenomenon
that
of
seeing
thus
at
once
the
in
the
in
this
extraordinary
manner
not
less
marvellous
is
the
thought
of
seeing
the
stars
not
such
as
they
are
when
one
makes
the
observation
nor
as
they
have
been
simultaneously
but
as
they
have
been
at
different
epochs
according
to
their
distances
and
the
time
that
the
light
of
each
has
taken
in
coming
to
the
earth
sidenote
light
lumen
i
venture
to
say
that
the
natural
astonishment
that
you
feel
in
contemplating
this
truth
is
only
the
prelude
to
the
things
which
i
have
now
to
unfold
to
you
undoubtedly
it
appears
at
first
sight
very
extraordinary
that
by
removing
to
a
distance
in
space
one
can
become
a
witness
of
long
past
events
and
remount
as
it
were
the
stream
of
time
but
this
is
not
more
strange
than
what
i
have
yet
to
communicate
to
you
and
which
will
appear
to
you
still
more
imaginary
if
you
can
listen
a
little
longer
to
the
narrative
of
that
day
which
followed
my
death
quærens
go
on
i
beg
of
you
i
am
eager
to
hear
you
iii
sidenote
lumen
sees
his
own
life
on
earth
lumen
on
turning
away
from
the
sanguinary
scenes
of
the
place
de
la
révolution
my
eyes
were
attracted
towards
a
habitation
of
somewhat
an
antique
style
situated
in
front
of
notre
dame
and
occupying
the
place
of
the
present
square
in
front
of
the
cathedral
i
saw
a
group
of
five
persons
before
the
entrance
of
the
cathedral
who
were
reclining
on
wooden
benches
in
the
sunshine
with
their
heads
uncovered
when
they
rose
and
crossed
the
square
i
perceived
that
one
was
my
father
younger
than
i
could
remember
him
another
my
mother
still
younger
and
a
third
a
cousin
of
mine
who
died
the
same
year
as
my
father
now
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
recognise
these
persons
for
instead
of
facing
them
i
saw
them
only
from
on
high
above
their
heads
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
meeting
but
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
heard
that
my
parents
lived
in
the
place
notre
dame
before
my
birth
i
can
not
tell
you
how
profoundly
i
was
affected
by
this
sight
my
perception
seemed
to
fail
me
and
a
cloud
appeared
to
obscure
paris
from
my
view
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
carried
off
by
a
whirlwind
for
as
you
are
aware
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
when
i
began
again
to
see
objects
distinctly
i
noticed
a
troop
of
children
running
across
the
place
de
panthéon
they
looked
like
school
children
coming
out
of
class
for
they
had
their
portfolios
and
books
in
their
hands
and
were
apparently
going
to
their
homes
gambolling
and
gesticulating
two
of
them
attracted
me
especially
for
i
saw
they
were
quarrelling
and
just
preparing
to
fight
and
another
little
fellow
was
advancing
to
separate
them
when
he
received
a
blow
on
the
shoulder
and
was
thrown
down
in
an
instant
a
woman
ran
to
help
him
this
was
my
own
mother
words
fail
me
to
tell
my
amazement
when
i
perceived
that
the
child
to
whose
rescue
my
mother
came
was
own
never
in
my
years
of
earthly
life
with
all
the
changes
and
strange
events
with
which
it
was
crowded
never
in
all
its
surprises
and
chances
have
i
felt
such
emotion
as
this
sight
caused
me
i
was
completely
overcome
when
in
this
child
i
recognised
quærens
you
saw
yourself
lumen
yes
myself
with
the
blond
curls
of
six
years
of
age
with
my
little
collar
embroidered
by
my
mother
hands
my
little
blouse
of
light
blue
colour
and
the
cuffs
always
rumpled
there
i
was
the
very
same
as
you
have
seen
in
the
miniature
that
stood
on
my
mantelpiece
my
mother
came
over
to
me
and
sharply
reproving
the
other
boys
took
me
up
in
her
arms
and
then
led
me
by
the
hand
into
the
house
which
was
close
to
the
rue
there
i
saw
that
after
passing
through
the
house
we
reappeared
in
the
garden
in
the
midst
of
a
numerous
company
quærens
master
pardon
me
a
criticism
i
confess
to
you
that
it
appears
to
me
impossible
that
you
could
see
yourself
you
could
not
be
two
persons
and
since
you
were
years
old
your
infancy
was
passed
and
had
totally
disappeared
you
could
not
see
a
thing
that
no
longer
existed
i
can
not
comprehend
how
when
an
old
man
you
could
see
yourself
as
an
infant
lumen
why
can
not
you
admit
this
point
on
the
same
grounds
as
the
preceding
ones
quærens
because
you
can
not
see
yourself
double
an
infant
and
an
old
man
at
the
same
time
sidenote
a
logical
inference
lumen
look
at
the
matter
more
closely
my
friend
you
admit
the
general
fact
but
you
do
not
sufficiently
observe
that
this
last
particular
is
logically
inferred
from
that
fact
you
admit
that
the
view
i
had
of
the
earth
was
years
in
coming
to
me
do
you
not
that
events
reached
me
only
at
that
interval
of
time
after
they
had
taken
place
in
short
that
i
saw
the
world
as
it
was
at
that
epoch
you
admit
likewise
that
as
i
saw
the
streets
of
that
time
i
saw
also
the
children
running
in
those
streets
you
admit
all
this
quærens
yes
decidedly
lumen
well
then
since
i
saw
this
troop
of
children
and
myself
amongst
them
why
do
you
say
i
could
not
see
myself
as
well
as
the
others
quærens
but
you
were
no
longer
there
amongst
them
lumen
again
i
repeat
this
whole
troop
of
children
has
ceased
to
exist
but
i
saw
them
such
as
they
were
at
the
moment
the
ray
of
light
left
the
earth
which
only
reached
me
at
the
present
time
and
as
i
could
distinguish
the
fifteen
to
eighteen
children
in
the
group
there
was
no
reason
why
i
should
disappear
from
amongst
them
because
i
myself
was
the
distant
spectator
since
any
other
observer
could
see
me
in
company
with
my
comrades
why
should
i
form
an
exception
i
saw
them
all
and
i
saw
myself
amongst
them
quærens
i
had
not
fully
taken
in
the
idea
it
is
evident
in
short
that
seeing
a
troop
of
children
of
whom
you
were
one
you
could
not
fail
to
see
yourself
as
well
as
you
saw
the
others
sidenote
lumen
sees
himself
a
child
lumen
now
you
can
understand
into
what
a
state
of
surprise
i
was
thrown
this
child
was
really
myself
flesh
and
bones
as
the
vulgar
expression
has
it
myself
at
the
age
of
six
years
i
saw
myself
as
well
as
the
company
in
the
garden
who
were
playing
with
me
saw
me
it
was
no
mirage
no
vision
no
spectre
no
reminiscence
no
image
it
was
reality
positively
myself
my
thought
and
my
body
i
was
there
before
my
eyes
if
my
other
senses
had
the
perfection
of
my
sight
it
seemed
as
though
i
should
have
been
able
to
touch
and
hear
myself
i
jumped
about
the
garden
and
ran
round
the
pond
which
had
a
balustrade
around
it
some
time
after
my
grandfather
took
me
on
his
knees
and
made
me
read
in
a
big
book
it
is
not
possible
for
me
to
describe
my
astonishment
i
must
leave
you
to
imagine
what
it
was
to
me
and
to
realise
the
fact
now
that
you
understand
upon
what
it
was
based
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
had
never
received
such
a
surprise
in
my
life
one
reflection
especially
puzzled
me
i
said
to
myself
this
child
is
really
me
he
is
alive
he
will
grow
up
and
he
ought
to
live
years
longer
it
is
undoubtedly
myself
and
on
the
other
hand
here
i
am
having
lived
years
of
the
terrestrial
life
i
who
now
think
and
see
these
things
i
am
still
myself
and
this
child
is
me
also
i
then
two
one
there
below
on
the
earth
and
the
other
here
in
space
two
complete
persons
and
yet
quite
distinct
an
observer
placed
where
i
am
could
see
this
child
in
the
garden
as
i
see
him
and
at
the
same
time
see
me
here
i
must
be
two
it
is
incontestable
my
soul
is
in
this
child
it
is
no
less
here
it
is
the
same
soul
my
own
soul
how
can
it
animate
two
beings
what
a
strange
reality
for
i
can
not
say
that
i
delude
myself
or
that
what
i
see
is
an
optical
illusion
for
both
according
to
nature
and
by
the
laws
of
science
i
see
at
once
a
child
and
an
old
man
the
one
there
beyond
the
other
here
where
i
am
the
former
joyous
and
the
other
pensive
and
agitated
quærens
in
truth
it
is
strange
sidenote
lumen
sees
himself
a
young
man
sidenote
lumen
witnesses
the
events
of
the
hundred
days
lumen
yes
but
no
less
true
you
may
search
through
all
creation
and
not
find
such
a
paradox
well
to
proceed
with
my
history
i
saw
myself
grow
up
in
this
vast
city
of
paris
i
saw
myself
enter
college
in
and
perform
my
first
military
exercises
when
the
first
consul
was
crowned
emperor
one
day
as
i
passed
by
the
carrousel
i
got
a
glimpse
of
the
domineering
and
thoughtful
face
of
napoleon
i
could
not
remember
having
seen
him
in
my
life
and
it
was
interesting
to
see
him
thus
pass
across
my
field
of
view
in
i
saw
myself
promoted
to
the
polytechnic
school
and
there
i
was
talking
of
the
course
of
studies
with
françois
arago
the
best
of
comrades
he
already
belonged
to
the
institute
and
had
replaced
monge
at
the
school
because
the
emperor
had
complained
of
the
jesuitism
of
binet
i
saw
myself
in
like
manner
all
through
the
brilliant
years
of
my
youth
full
of
projects
of
travels
for
scientific
exploration
in
company
with
arago
and
humboldt
travels
which
only
the
latter
decided
to
undertake
later
on
i
saw
myself
during
the
hundred
days
crossing
quickly
the
little
wood
of
the
old
luxembourg
and
then
the
rue
de
and
the
avenue
of
the
garden
of
the
rue
jaques
and
hastening
to
meet
my
beloved
under
the
sweet
meetings
all
to
ourselves
the
confidences
of
our
hearts
the
silences
of
our
souls
the
transports
of
our
evening
conversations
were
all
presented
to
my
astonished
sight
no
longer
veiled
by
distance
but
actually
before
my
eyes
i
was
present
again
at
the
combat
with
the
allies
on
the
hill
of
montmartre
and
saw
their
descent
into
the
capital
and
the
fall
of
the
statue
in
the
place
vendôme
when
it
was
drawn
through
the
streets
with
cries
of
joy
i
saw
the
camp
of
the
english
and
the
prussians
in
the
the
destruction
of
the
louvre
the
journey
to
ghent
the
entrance
of
louis
xviii
sidenote
napoleon
at
st
helena
the
flag
of
the
island
of
elba
floated
before
my
eyes
and
later
on
i
sought
out
the
far
atlantic
isle
where
the
eagle
with
his
wings
broken
was
chained
the
rotation
of
the
earth
soon
brought
before
my
eyes
the
emperor
in
helena
sadly
musing
at
the
foot
of
a
sidenote
historical
events
appear
in
succession
thus
the
events
of
the
years
as
they
passed
were
revealed
to
me
in
following
my
own
career
my
marriage
my
various
enterprises
my
connections
my
travels
my
studies
and
so
on
i
witnessed
at
the
same
time
the
development
of
contemporary
history
to
the
restoration
of
louis
xviii
succeeded
the
brief
reign
of
charles
i
saw
the
barricades
of
the
days
of
july
and
not
far
from
the
throne
of
the
duke
of
orleans
i
saw
the
column
of
the
bastile
arise
passing
rapidly
over
eighteen
years
i
perceived
myself
at
the
luxembourg
at
the
time
when
that
magnificent
avenue
was
opened
that
avenue
i
loved
so
much
and
which
has
been
threatened
by
a
recent
decree
i
saw
arago
again
this
time
at
the
observatory
and
i
beheld
the
crowd
before
the
door
of
the
new
amphitheatre
i
recognised
the
sorbonne
of
cousin
and
of
guizot
then
i
shuddered
as
i
saw
my
mother
funeral
pass
she
was
a
stern
woman
and
perhaps
a
little
too
severe
in
her
judgments
but
i
loved
her
dearly
as
you
know
the
singular
and
brief
revolution
of
surprised
me
as
much
as
when
i
first
witnessed
it
on
the
place
de
la
bourse
i
saw
lamoricière
who
was
buried
last
year
and
in
the
cavaignac
who
has
been
dead
five
or
six
years
the
of
december
found
me
an
observer
on
my
solitary
tower
and
from
thence
i
witnessed
many
striking
events
which
passed
before
me
and
many
others
which
were
unknown
to
me
quærens
did
the
event
pass
rapidly
before
you
lumen
i
had
no
perception
of
time
but
the
whole
retrospective
panorama
appeared
to
me
in
successive
scenes
in
less
than
a
day
perhaps
in
a
few
hours
quærens
then
i
do
not
understand
you
at
all
pardon
your
old
friend
this
interruption
a
little
too
abrupt
perhaps
as
i
took
it
you
saw
the
real
events
of
your
life
not
merely
images
of
them
but
in
view
of
the
time
necessary
for
the
passage
of
light
these
events
appeared
to
you
after
they
had
happened
if
then
terrestrial
years
had
passed
before
your
eyes
they
should
have
taken
years
to
appear
to
you
and
not
a
few
hours
if
the
year
appeared
to
you
only
in
the
year
consequently
should
only
in
appear
to
you
sidenote
the
anachronism
explained
lumen
you
have
grounds
for
your
fresh
objection
and
this
proves
to
me
that
you
have
perfectly
comprehended
the
theory
of
this
fact
i
fully
appreciate
your
belief
in
me
indeed
its
consciousness
helps
me
in
my
explanations
thus
it
is
not
necessary
that
years
should
be
needed
in
which
to
review
my
life
for
under
the
impulse
of
an
involuntary
force
all
its
events
passed
before
me
in
less
than
a
day
continuing
to
follow
the
course
of
my
existence
i
reached
its
later
years
rendered
memorable
by
the
striking
changes
which
had
come
over
paris
i
saw
our
old
friends
and
you
yourself
my
daughter
and
her
charming
children
my
family
and
circle
of
acquaintances
and
last
of
all
i
saw
myself
lying
dead
upon
my
bed
and
i
was
present
at
the
final
scene
yes
i
tell
you
i
had
returned
to
the
earth
drawn
by
the
contemplation
which
absorbed
my
soul
i
had
quickly
forgotten
the
mountain
the
old
men
and
capella
even
as
a
dream
all
faded
from
my
mind
i
did
not
at
first
perceive
the
strange
vision
which
captivated
all
my
faculties
i
can
not
tell
you
either
by
what
law
or
by
what
power
souls
can
be
transported
with
such
rapidity
from
one
place
to
another
suffice
it
to
say
had
returned
to
the
in
less
than
a
day
and
i
had
entered
my
chamber
even
at
the
moment
of
my
decease
also
in
this
returning
voyage
i
had
travelled
faster
than
the
rays
of
light
hence
the
various
phases
of
my
life
on
earth
had
unrolled
themselves
to
my
sight
in
their
successive
stages
as
they
occurred
when
i
reached
i
saw
the
rays
of
light
arriving
only
years
behind
time
showing
me
the
earth
not
as
it
appeared
years
ago
but
when
i
had
travelled
of
the
way
i
saw
things
as
they
had
been
eighteen
years
ago
at
the
half
of
the
last
quarter
as
they
were
nine
years
previously
until
finally
the
whole
acts
of
my
life
were
condensed
into
less
than
one
day
because
of
the
rapid
rate
at
which
my
soul
had
travelled
which
far
surpassed
the
velocity
of
the
rays
of
light
quærens
was
not
this
a
very
strange
phenomenon
lumen
do
any
other
objections
rise
in
your
mind
as
you
listen
to
me
quærens
no
this
is
the
only
one
or
rather
this
one
has
puzzled
and
interested
me
so
greatly
that
it
has
absorbed
all
others
lumen
i
would
remark
that
there
is
another
an
astronomical
one
which
i
will
hasten
to
dispel
for
fear
it
should
arise
and
cloud
your
mind
it
depends
upon
the
earth
movement
not
only
upon
its
diurnal
rotation
which
in
itself
would
be
sufficient
to
prevent
my
seeing
the
facts
in
succession
but
this
movement
would
also
be
greatly
accelerated
by
the
rapidity
of
my
return
to
the
earth
hence
years
would
pass
before
me
in
less
than
a
day
on
reflection
i
was
surprised
that
i
had
not
earlier
perceived
this
yet
as
i
had
only
seen
a
comparatively
small
number
of
countries
panoramas
and
facts
it
is
probable
that
in
returning
to
our
planet
i
had
only
a
fleeting
glance
for
a
few
moments
of
the
successive
points
of
interest
but
however
this
may
be
i
can
but
bear
evidence
that
i
have
been
witness
to
the
rapid
succession
of
events
both
throughout
the
century
and
of
my
own
life
quærens
that
difficulty
had
not
escaped
me
i
had
weighed
the
thought
and
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
you
had
revolved
in
space
even
as
a
balloon
is
spun
round
by
the
rotation
of
the
globe
it
is
true
that
the
inconceivable
speed
with
which
you
would
be
whirled
through
space
would
be
likely
to
give
you
vertigo
nevertheless
after
hearing
your
experience
this
hypothesis
forces
itself
upon
me
that
spirits
rush
through
space
with
the
lightness
and
velocity
of
thought
and
in
remarking
on
the
intensity
of
your
gaze
as
you
approached
certain
parts
of
the
earth
may
it
not
be
admissible
to
infer
that
this
very
eagerness
to
see
certain
localities
might
be
the
reason
of
your
being
drawn
to
them
and
as
it
were
fixed
above
their
point
of
vision
lumen
as
to
this
i
can
affirm
nothing
because
i
know
nothing
but
i
do
not
think
this
is
the
explanation
i
did
not
see
all
the
events
of
my
life
but
only
a
few
of
the
main
ones
which
successively
unfolding
passed
in
review
before
me
on
the
same
visual
ray
a
magnetism
drew
me
imperiously
as
with
a
chain
to
the
earth
or
if
you
prefer
it
a
force
similar
to
that
mysterious
attraction
of
the
stars
by
reason
of
which
stars
of
a
lesser
degree
would
inevitably
fall
upon
those
of
the
first
magnitude
unless
retained
in
their
orbits
by
centrifugal
force
quærens
in
reflecting
on
the
effect
of
the
concentration
of
thought
upon
a
single
point
and
of
the
attraction
which
consequently
ensues
towards
that
point
i
can
not
but
conclude
that
therein
lies
the
mainspring
of
the
mechanism
of
dreams
sidenote
the
source
of
dreams
lumen
you
say
truly
my
friend
i
can
confirm
you
in
this
remark
as
for
many
years
i
have
made
dreams
the
subject
of
a
special
study
and
observation
when
the
soul
freed
from
the
attentions
the
preoccupations
the
encumbrance
of
the
body
has
a
vision
of
the
object
which
charms
it
and
towards
which
it
is
irresistibly
drawn
all
disappear
except
the
object
that
alone
remains
and
becomes
the
centre
of
a
world
of
creations
the
soul
possesses
it
entirely
without
any
reserve
it
contemplates
it
it
seizes
it
as
its
own
the
entire
universe
is
effaced
from
the
memory
in
order
that
its
domination
over
the
soul
may
be
absolute
i
felt
thus
on
being
drawn
earthwards
i
saw
but
one
object
around
which
were
grouped
the
ideas
the
images
and
the
associations
to
which
it
had
given
birth
quærens
your
rapid
flight
to
capella
and
your
equally
rapid
return
to
the
earth
were
governed
by
this
psychological
law
and
you
acted
more
freely
than
in
a
dream
because
your
soul
was
not
impeded
by
the
machinery
of
your
organism
often
in
our
former
conversations
have
you
discoursed
to
me
upon
the
strength
of
the
will
thus
willing
to
do
so
you
were
enabled
to
return
and
to
see
yourself
upon
your
before
your
mortal
remains
had
been
committed
to
the
dust
sidenote
lumen
witnesses
his
own
funeral
sidenote
his
flight
to
the
stars
lumen
i
did
return
and
i
blessed
my
family
for
the
sincerity
of
their
grief
i
shed
a
benediction
on
them
i
soothed
their
grief
and
poured
balm
upon
their
wounded
hearts
and
i
inspired
my
children
with
the
belief
that
the
body
lying
there
was
not
my
real
self
my
but
merely
the
shell
from
which
my
soul
had
risen
to
a
sphere
celestial
infinite
and
far
beyond
their
earthly
ken
i
witnessed
my
own
funeral
procession
and
i
noticed
those
who
called
themselves
my
friends
and
who
yet
for
some
trifling
reason
begged
to
be
excused
from
following
my
remains
to
their
last
i
listened
to
the
various
comments
of
those
following
my
bier
and
although
in
this
region
of
peace
we
are
free
from
that
thirst
for
praise
which
clings
to
most
of
us
whilst
on
earth
nevertheless
i
felt
gratified
to
know
that
i
had
left
pleasant
memories
behind
me
when
the
stone
of
the
vault
was
rolled
away
that
which
separates
the
dead
from
the
living
i
gave
a
last
farewell
to
my
poor
sleeping
body
and
as
the
sun
set
in
its
bed
of
purple
and
gold
i
went
out
into
the
air
until
night
had
fallen
plunged
in
admiration
of
the
beautiful
scenes
which
unrolled
themselves
in
the
heavens
the
aurora
borealis
displayed
itself
above
the
north
pole
in
bands
of
glistening
silver
shooting
stars
rained
from
cassiopeia
and
the
full
moon
rose
slowly
in
the
east
like
a
new
world
emerging
from
the
waves
i
saw
capella
scintillating
and
looking
at
me
with
a
glance
pure
and
bright
and
could
distinguish
the
crowns
surrounding
it
as
if
they
were
princes
dowered
with
a
celestial
divinity
then
i
forgot
the
earth
the
moon
the
planetary
system
the
sun
the
comets
in
one
intense
overpowering
attraction
towards
a
shining
brilliant
star
and
i
felt
myself
carried
towards
it
instinctively
with
a
celerity
far
greater
than
that
of
an
electric
flash
after
a
time
the
duration
of
which
i
can
not
guess
i
arrived
upon
the
same
ring
and
upon
the
same
mountain
from
which
i
had
first
kept
watch
when
i
saw
the
old
men
occupied
in
following
the
history
of
the
earth
years
and
eight
months
ago
they
were
still
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
events
happening
in
the
city
of
lyons
on
the
of
january
i
will
avow
to
you
the
reason
of
the
mysterious
attraction
of
capella
for
me
for
marvellous
as
it
may
seem
there
are
in
creation
invisible
ties
which
do
not
break
like
mortal
ties
there
are
means
by
which
souls
can
commune
with
each
other
in
spite
of
the
distance
that
separates
them
sidenote

meets
the
spirit
of
his
wife
sidenote

recall
their
life
on
earth
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
as
the
emerald
moon
enshrined
itself
in
the
third
ring
of
gold
for
such
is
the
sidereal
measurement
of
time
i
found
myself
walking
in
a
lonely
avenue
enamelled
with
flowers
of
sweet
perfume
sauntering
along
as
if
in
a
dream
imagine
my
delight
when
i
saw
coming
towards
me
my
beautiful
and
beloved
sylvia
she
was
at
a
ripe
age
at
her
death
and
notwithstanding
an
indefinable
change
i
recognised
the
features
whose
expression
had
but
deepened
and
spiritualised
in
happy
correspondence
with
her
sweet
pure
life
i
will
not
stop
to
describe
to
you
the
joy
of
our
meeting
this
is
not
the
time
for
it
but
perchance
some
day
we
may
have
the
opportunity
of
descanting
upon
the
different
manifestations
of
affection
in
this
world
and
the
world
beyond
the
grave
and
i
only
add
now
that
together
we
sought
our
native
land
on
earth
where
we
had
passed
days
of
peace
and
happiness
we
delighted
to
turn
our
gaze
towards
the
luminous
point
which
our
state
of
exaltation
enabled
us
to
perceive
was
a
world
the
one
upon
which
we
had
lived
in
earthly
form
we
loved
to
wed
the
memory
of
the
past
with
the
reality
of
our
present
and
in
all
the
freshness
of
our
new
and
ecstatic
sensations
we
sought
to
recall
and
review
the
scenes
of
our
youth
it
was
thus
we
actually
saw
again
the
happy
years
of
our
earthly
love
the
pavilion
of
the
convent
the
flower
garden
the
promenades
in
the
charming
and
delightful
environs
of
paris
and
the
solitary
rambles
that
loving
and
beloved
we
took
together
to
retrace
these
years
we
had
but
to
travel
together
into
space
in
the
direction
of
the
earth
where
these
scenes
focused
by
the
light
were
being
photographed
now
my
friend
i
have
fulfilled
my
promise
in
revealing
to
you
these
remarkable
observations
behold
the
day
breaks
and
the
star
lucifer
is
paling
already
under
its
rosy
light
i
must
return
to
the
constellations
quærens
just
one
more
word
lumen
before
we
conclude
this
interview
can
earthly
scenes
be
transmitted
successively
into
space
if
so
the
present
could
be
kept
perpetually
before
the
eyes
of
distant
spectators
and
be
limited
only
by
the
power
of
their
spiritual
sight
sidenote
the
precession
of
events
as
seen
in
space
lumen
yes
my
friend
let
us
for
example
place
our
first
observer
on
the
moon
he
would
perceive
terrestrial
events
one
second
and
a
quarter
after
they
had
happened
let
us
place
a
second
observer
at
four
times
the
distance
he
would
be
cognisant
of
them
five
seconds
later
double
the
distance
and
a
third
would
see
them
ten
seconds
after
they
had
taken
place
again
double
the
distance
and
a
fourth
observer
would
have
to
wait
twenty
seconds
before
he
could
witness
them
so
on
and
on
with
delay
until
at
the
sun
distance
eight
minutes
and
thirteen
seconds
must
elapse
before
they
could
become
visible
upon
certain
planets
as
we
have
seen
hours
must
intervene
between
the
action
and
the
sight
of
it
further
off
still
days
months
even
years
must
elapse
upon
neighbouring
stars
earthly
events
are
not
seen
until
four
six
ten
years
after
their
occurrence
but
there
are
stars
so
distant
that
light
only
reaches
them
after
many
centuries
and
even
thousands
of
years
indeed
there
are
nebulæ
to
which
light
takes
millions
of
years
to
travel
quærens
therefore
it
only
needs
a
sight
sufficiently
piercing
to
witness
events
historic
or
geologic
which
are
long
since
past
could
not
one
therefore
so
gifted
see
the
deluge
the
garden
of
eden
adam
and
lumen
i
have
told
you
my
old
friend
that
the
rising
of
the
sun
on
this
hemisphere
puts
to
flight
all
spirits
so
i
must
go
another
interview
may
be
granted
us
some
other
day
when
we
can
continue
our
talk
on
this
subject
and
i
will
then
give
you
a
general
sketch
which
will
open
out
for
you
new
horizons
the
stars
call
me
and
are
already
disappearing
i
must
away
adieu
quærens
adieu
footnotes
physiological
anatomy
would
probably
explain
this
fact
by
suggesting
that
a
sort
of
is
displaced
in
order
to
conceal
the
object
that
one
does
not
wish
to
see
every
one
knows
that
the
farther
an
object
is
the
smaller
it
appears
an
object
which
is
seen
under
an
angle
of
one
second
is
at
a
distance
of
times
its
own
diameter
whatever
it
may
be
because
as
there
are
seconds
in
the
circumference
the
ratio
between
the
circumference
and
its
diameter
being
it
follows
that
this
object
is
at
a
distance
equal
to
times
its
own
diameter
as
capella
sees
the
of
the
terrestrial
orbit
only
under
an
angle
times
smaller
its
distance
is
times
greater
capella
is
therefore
at
a
distance
of
times
the
radius
of
the
terrestrial
orbit
future
micrometrical
measurements
may
modify
these
results
concerning
the
parallax
of
this
star
but
they
can
not
change
the
principle
upon
which
the
conception
of
this
work
is
grounded
second
conversation
refluum
temporis
i
quærens
your
revelations
which
were
interrupted
by
the
break
of
day
o
lumen
have
left
me
hungering
and
thirsting
to
hear
more
of
this
wonderful
mystery
as
a
child
to
whom
one
shows
a
delicious
fruit
longs
to
have
a
bite
and
when
he
has
tasted
of
it
begs
for
more
so
my
curiosity
is
eager
to
have
renewed
enjoyment
of
these
paradoxes
of
nature
may
i
venture
to
submit
to
you
a
few
questions
in
relation
to
the
subject
which
have
been
suggested
to
me
by
the
friends
to
whom
i
have
communicated
the
substance
of
your
revelations
and
then
may
i
ask
you
to
continue
the
narrative
of
your
impressions
of
the
regions
beyond
this
earth
sidenote
scientific
truth
not
fancy
or
romance
lumen
no
my
friend
i
can
not
consent
to
such
curiosity
however
perfectly
disposed
your
mind
may
be
to
accept
my
communications
i
am
convinced
that
all
the
details
of
my
subject
have
not
been
equally
apprehended
by
you
and
are
not
in
your
eyes
equally
my
recital
has
been
called
mystical
by
those
who
have
not
quite
understood
that
it
is
neither
a
romance
nor
a
phantasy
but
a
scientific
truth
a
physical
fact
demonstrable
and
demonstrated
indisputable
and
as
positive
as
the
fall
of
an
aerolite
or
the
motion
of
a
the
reason
which
prevents
you
and
your
friends
from
fully
comprehending
these
facts
is
that
they
took
place
beyond
this
earth
in
regions
foreign
to
the
sphere
of
your
impressions
and
inaccessible
to
your
terrestrial
senses
naturally
you
do
not
comprehend
them
pardon
my
frankness
but
in
the
spiritual
world
one
is
frank
there
even
thoughts
are
visible
you
only
comprehend
those
things
which
you
perceive
and
as
you
persist
in
regarding
your
ideas
of
time
and
space
as
although
they
are
only
and
thence
form
a
judgment
on
truths
which
are
quite
beyond
your
sphere
and
which
are
imperceptible
to
your
terrestrial
organism
and
faculties
i
should
not
do
you
a
true
service
my
friend
in
giving
you
fuller
details
of
my
observations
sidenote
an
inquiring
mind
quærens
it
is
not
i
assure
you
in
a
spirit
of
simple
curiosity
dear
lumen
that
i
ventured
to
draw
you
forth
from
the
bosom
of
the
invisible
world
where
advanced
souls
partake
of
indescribable
joys
but
i
have
understood
perhaps
better
than
you
the
grandeur
of
the
problem
and
it
is
under
the
inspiration
of
an
earnest
studious
avidity
that
i
seek
for
other
aspects
of
it
still
more
novel
than
those
you
have
given
me
if
i
may
say
so
or
rather
more
bold
and
more
incomprehensible
as
the
result
of
reflection
i
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
what
we
know
is
and
that
what
we
do
not
know
is
i
am
therefore
disposed
to
welcome
everything
you
tell
me
i
beg
of
you
if
you
will
allow
me
to
share
your
revelations
lumen
the
fact
is
my
friend
i
assure
you
either
you
are
not
sufficiently
able
to
understand
or
you
are
too
willing
to
believe
in
the
first
case
you
do
not
fully
comprehend
in
the
second
you
are
too
credulous
and
do
not
appreciate
my
communications
at
their
full
value
however
i
shall
continue
quærens
dear
comrade
of
my
earthly
life
lumen
the
remaining
facts
which
i
shall
now
relate
to
you
are
still
more
extraordinary
than
any
that
preceded
them
quærens
i
feel
like
tantalus
in
the
midst
of
his
lake
or
like
the
spirits
in
the
canto
of
the
purgatorio
i
am
as
eager
as
the
hesperides
holding
out
their
hands
for
the
fragrant
fruit
or
as
eve
in
her
desire
for
sidenote
travelling
on
a
ray
of
light
sidenote
lumen
sees
the
revolution
of
lumen
some
time
after
my
departure
from
the
earth
the
eyes
of
my
soul
being
still
mournfully
directed
toward
my
native
world
i
found
that
on
an
attentive
examination
i
could
perceive
at
the
degree
of
north
latitude
and
the
degree
of
longitude
a
triangular
piece
of
land
of
a
sombre
colour
north
of
the
black
sea
on
the
shores
of
which
i
saw
towards
the
west
a
grievous
number
of
my
compatriots
madly
engaged
in
killing
one
another
i
recalled
to
mind
that
relic
of
barbarism
war
formerly
called
glorious
with
which
you
are
still
beset
and
burdened
and
i
remembered
that
in
this
corner
of
the
crimea
men
fell
in
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
their
mutual
massacre
some
clouds
then
passed
over
europe
at
that
time
i
was
not
on
capella
but
in
mid
space
between
that
star
and
the
earth
about
half
the
distance
from
vega
having
left
the
earth
some
time
before
i
turned
toward
a
group
of
stars
that
seen
from
your
planet
are
to
the
left
of
capella
meanwhile
my
thoughts
recurred
from
time
to
time
to
the
earth
and
soon
after
taking
the
observation
to
which
i
have
referred
my
eyes
being
fixed
on
paris
i
was
surprised
to
see
it
a
prey
to
an
insurrection
of
the
people
examining
it
more
attentively
i
discerned
barricades
on
the
boulevards
near
the
hôtel
de
ville
and
along
the
streets
and
the
citizens
firing
at
one
another
the
first
idea
that
occurred
to
me
was
that
a
new
revolution
was
taking
place
before
my
eyes
and
that
napoleon
iii
was
dethroned
but
by
the
secret
sympathy
of
souls
my
sight
was
attracted
to
a
barricade
in
the
faubourg
antoine
upon
which
i
saw
lying
prostrate
the
archbishop
denis
auguste
affre
with
whom
i
had
been
slightly
acquainted
his
sightless
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
heavens
where
i
was
but
he
saw
nothing
in
his
hand
he
held
a
green
branch
i
was
thus
witnessing
the
days
of
and
in
particular
that
of
the
of
june
sidenote
he
sees
the
events
of
a
few
minutes
a
few
hours
perhaps
passed
during
which
my
imagination
and
my
reason
sought
in
turns
for
an
explanation
of
this
special
scene
to
see
when
my
sight
was
again
attracted
to
the
earth
i
remarked
a
distribution
of
tricoloured
flags
in
a
grand
square
of
the
city
of
lyons
trying
to
distinguish
the
official
person
who
was
making
this
distribution
i
recognised
the
uniforms
and
i
remembered
that
after
the
accession
of
louis
philippe
the
young
duke
of
orleans
had
been
sent
to
quell
the
disturbances
in
the
capital
of
french
manufactures
it
followed
from
thence
that
and
i
had
before
my
eyes
an
event
of
presently
my
glance
turned
to
paris
on
the
day
of
a
public
fête
the
king
a
man
with
a
rubicund
face
was
tearing
along
in
a
magnificent
chariot
and
was
just
crossing
the
pont
neuf
the
weather
was
splendid
some
fair
ladies
posed
like
a
basket
of
lilies
on
the
white
parapet
of
the
bridge
floating
over
paris
some
creatures
could
be
seen
evidently
i
beheld
the
en
trance
of
the
bourbons
into
france
sidenote
supposed
explanation
of
this
strange
slight
i
should
not
have
understood
this
last
strange
sight
if
i
had
not
recollected
that
a
number
of
balloons
in
the
form
of
animals
had
been
sent
up
on
that
occasion
from
my
higher
altitude
they
appeared
to
wriggle
about
the
roofs
of
the
houses
to
see
again
past
events
was
comprehensible
enough
according
to
the
law
of
light
but
to
see
things
contrary
to
their
real
order
in
time
that
was
too
fantastic
and
puzzled
me
beyond
expression
nevertheless
as
i
had
the
things
before
my
eyes
i
could
not
deny
the
fact
i
sought
forthwith
for
some
hypothesis
to
account
for
this
singular
phenomenon
at
first
i
supposed
it
was
really
the
earth
that
i
saw
and
that
by
a
fiat
of
fate
the
secret
of
which
is
known
only
to
god
the
history
of
france
repeats
itself
and
passes
through
the
same
phases
that
it
has
already
traversed
that
the
course
of
events
proceed
up
to
a
certain
maximum
where
they
shine
gloriously
for
a
time
and
then
comes
a
reaction
to
the
original
state
of
things
by
an
oscillation
in
human
affairs
like
the
variations
of
the
magnetic
needle
or
like
the
movements
of
the
stars
the
personages
whom
i
took
for
the
duke
of
orleans
and
louis
xviii
were
perhaps
other
princes
who
were
repeating
exactly
what
the
former
had
done
this
hypothesis
however
appeared
to
be
so
very
extraordinary
that
i
paused
to
consider
a
more
rational
theory
admitting
the
fact
of
the
number
of
stars
with
planets
moving
round
them
is
it
not
probable
that
a
world
exactly
like
the
earth
exists
somewhere
in
the
universe
of
space
sidenote
calculation
of
probabilities
the
calculation
of
probabilities
supplies
an
answer
to
this
question
the
greater
the
number
of
worlds
the
greater
will
be
the
probability
that
the
forces
of
nature
have
given
birth
to
an
organisation
like
that
of
the
earth
now
the
real
number
of
worlds
surpasses
all
human
calculation
either
written
or
possible
to
be
written
if
we
could
understand
what
infinite
means
we
might
venture
to
say
that
this
number
is
infinite
i
concluded
then
that
there
is
a
very
high
probability
in
favour
of
the
existence
of
many
worlds
exactly
like
the
earth
on
the
surface
of
which
the
same
history
is
accomplished
and
the
same
succession
of
historical
events
takes
place
worlds
which
are
inhabited
by
identically
the
same
species
of
vegetables
and
animals
and
the
same
humanity
and
where
men
and
families
like
our
own
i
doubt
not
exist
in
the
second
place
i
asked
myself
if
another
world
analogous
to
the
earth
might
not
also
be
symmetrical
to
it
and
then
i
worked
out
the
geometry
of
the
problem
and
the
metaphysical
theory
of
images
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
for
the
world
in
question
to
be
like
the
earth
but
in
an
inverse
form
when
you
look
at
yourself
in
a
mirror
you
notice
that
the
ring
on
your
right
hand
appears
to
be
on
the
of
your
left
hand
this
explains
the
symbol
if
you
wink
your
right
eye
your
reflection
winks
the
left
eye
when
you
advance
your
right
arm
your
image
advances
the
left
arm
it
is
not
impossible
that
in
the
infinity
of
the
stars
a
world
exists
exactly
the
converse
of
the
terrestrial
world
undoubtedly
in
an
of
worlds
the
of
a
similar
world
perhaps
of
millions
of
them
would
be
the
real
impossibility
nature
of
necessity
repeats
herself
reproduces
herself
but
still
under
all
forms
plays
the
game
of
creation
i
thought
therefore
that
the
world
on
which
i
saw
those
things
was
not
the
earth
but
a
globe
like
the
earth
the
history
of
which
was
precisely
the
opposite
of
yours
quærens
i
myself
have
had
the
idea
also
that
it
might
have
been
as
you
say
but
was
it
not
easy
for
you
to
make
sure
of
it
by
ascertaining
whether
it
was
the
earth
or
another
star
that
you
had
before
your
eyes
by
examining
its
astronomical
position
sidenote
the
solution
of
the
problem
lumen
that
is
precisely
what
i
did
immediately
and
this
examination
confirmed
me
in
my
opinion
the
star
where
i
had
just
witnessed
four
facts
analogous
to
four
terrestrial
facts
but
inversely
did
not
appear
to
me
to
occupy
its
original
position
the
little
constellation
of
the
altar
no
longer
existed
and
on
that
side
of
the
heavens
where
you
remember
the
earth
appeared
to
be
in
my
first
episode
there
was
an
irregular
polygon
of
unknown
stars
i
was
thus
convinced
that
it
was
not
our
earth
that
i
had
before
my
eyes
i
could
no
longer
feel
any
doubt
about
it
and
i
was
satisfied
that
i
had
now
for
my
field
of
exploration
a
world
so
much
the
more
curious
that

of
the
past
some
events
it
is
true
did
not
appear
to
have
corresponding
ones
on
the
earth
but
in
general
the
coincidence
was
very
remarkable
i
was
the
more
struck
with
this
because
the
contempt
which
i
feel
for
the
instigators
of
war
had
led
me
to
hope
that
a
folly
so
absurd
and
so
infamous
might
not
have
existed
in
other
worlds
but
on
the
contrary
the
greater
part
of
the
events
which
i
witnessed
were
combats
or
preparations
for
war
after
a
battle
which
appeared
to
me
very
much
to
resemble
that
of
waterloo
i
saw
the
battle
of
the
pyramids
an
image
of
napoleon
as
emperor
had
become
first
consul
and
i
saw
the
revolution
succeed
to
the
consulate
some
time
after
i
observed
the
square
in
front
of
the
château
of
versailles
covered
with
and
in
an
open
pathway
from
i
recognised
the
botanist
jean
jacques
rousseau
slowly
walking
along
and
no
doubt
at
that
moment
philosophising
on
the
death
of
louis
xv
i
was
particularly
struck
with
the
gala
fêtes
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
louis
worthy
successors
of
those
of
the
regency
during
which
the
treasures
of
france
glistened
in
precious
stones
on
the
fingers
of
the
three
or
four
adored
courtesans
i
saw
voltaire
with
his
white
cotton
cap
in
his
park
at
ferney
and
later
on
bossuet
walking
on
the
little
terrace
of
his
episcopal
palace
at
meaux
not
far
from
the
little
hill
through
which
the
railway
is
now
cut
but
i
could
not
see
the
least
trace
of
the
railway
line
in
this
same
succession
of
events
i
saw
the
highroads
covered
with
diligences
and
large
sailing
ships
on
the
seas
steam
and
all
the
factories
that
are
moved
by
it
now
had
disappeared
neither
telegraphs
nor
any
other
application
of
electricity
existed
balloons
which
more
than
once
i
had
seen
in
the
field
of
observation
were
lost
to
sight
the
last
that
i
saw
was
the
shapeless
globe
sent
up
by
the
brothers
montgolfier
at
annonay
in
the
presence
of
the
the
face
of
the
earth
was
quite
changed
paris
lyons
marseilles
havre
and
more
especially
versailles
were
not
recognisable
the
first
four
had
lost
their
immense
activity
the
last
had
gained
incomparably
in
magnificence
sidenote
the
monarchy
i
had
formed
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
the
splendour
of
the
royal
fêtes
at
versailles
it
was
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
be
present
at
them
and
it
was
not
without
interest
that
i
recognised
louis
xiv
himself
on
the
splendid
terrace
at
the
west
surrounded
by
a
thousand
nobles
whose
breasts
were
covered
with
decorations
it
was
in
the
evening
the
last
rays
of
glowing
sunshine
were
reflected
on
the
royal
façade
whilst
gallant
couples
gravely
descended
the
steps
of
the
marble
stairs
and
presently
disappeared
along
the
silent
and
shady
avenues
my
sight
was
fixed
in
preference
on
france
or
at
least
toward
that
region
of
this
unknown
world
which
represented
france
to
me
for
absence
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
and
when
far
from
one
country
one
thinks
of
it
all
the
more
and
recurs
with
ever
new
interest
to
the
thought
of
it
do
not
believe
that
souls
liberated
from
their
bodies
are
scornful
and
indifferent
and
devoid
of
memory
our
existence
would
then
be
a
sad
one
no
we
preserve
the
faculty
of
remembrance
our
hearts
are
not
wholly
absorbed
in
the
life
of
the
spirit
and
so
it
was
with
an
instinctive
feeling
of
delight
which
you
can
imagine
that
thus
i
saw
again
the
history
of

unfolded
before
me

i
could

saw
some
special
events
in
the
history
of
our
provinces
for
instance
one
of
the
scenes
in
the

of
chaumont
which
i
had

to
observe
before
the

and
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
at
vassy
what
a
comedy
is
human

alas

suddenly
i
beheld
in

the
magnificent
comet
of
in
the
form
of
a

in
grand
array
in
the
midst
of
a
plain

decorated

and
charles
saluting

louis
xi
i
perceived
on
a
terrace
of
the
bastile
attended
by
his
two
gloomy
companions
later
on
my
sight
was
turned
to
a
square
in
rouen
where
i
observed
flames
and
smoke
and
in
their
midst
i
discerned
the
form
of
the
maid
of
orleans
convinced
as
i
was
that
the
world
i
was
looking
at
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
the

i
divined
beforehand
the
events
that
i
was
about
to
see
thus
after
having
seen
saint
louis
dying
before
tunis
i
was
present
at
the
eighth
crusade
and
subsequently
at
the
third
where
i
recognised
frederick
barbarossa
by
his
beard
then
at
the
first
crusade
when
peter
the
hermit
and
godfrey
reminded
me
of
tasso
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
i
then
expected
to
see
in

in

itself

me
in
an

the
succession
of
events
this
was
what
actually
happened
many
historical
questions
which
were
very
important
and
which
had
hitherto
been
obscure
to
me
were
rendered
clear
i
ascertained
among
other
things
that
the
french
were
the
original
possessors
of
the
right
bank
of
the
rhine
and
that
the

there
was
i
assure
you
an
immense
interest
in
taking

if
i
may
so
express
myself
in
the
events
of
which
i
had
but
the
vague
ideas
derived
from
the
echoes
of
history
often
deceptive
and
in
visiting
countries
that
are
now
totally
transformed
the
vast
and
brilliant
capital
of
modern
civilisation
became
old
to
me
and
had
shrunk
to
the
size
of
an
ordinary
town
but
was
at
the
same
time
fortified
with
crenellated
towers
i
admired
in
turns
the
beautiful
city
of
the
fifteenth
century
its
curious
types
of
architecture
the
celebrated
tower
of
nesle
and
the
extensive
convents
of

where
the
tower
of
jacques
now
stands
i
recognised
the
gloomy
court
of
the
alchemist
nicolas
flamel
the
round
and
pointed
roofs
had
the
singular
effect
of
looking
like
mushrooms
on
the
banks
of
a
river
then
this
feudal
aspect
disappeared
and
gave
place
to
a
solitary
castle
in
the
seine
valley
surrounded
by
cottages
and
finally
there
was
nothing
but
a
fertile
plain
where
one
could
only
distinguish
a
few
huts
of
savages
at
the
same
time
i
remarked
that
the
seat
of
civilisation
was
changed
and
was
now
in
the
south
i
will
confess
to
you
my
friend
that
i
never
felt
greater
delight
than
at
the
moment
when
i
was
permitted
to
see
rome
of
the
cæsars
in
all
its
splendour
it
was
the
day
of
a
triumph
and
no
doubt
under
the
rule
of
the
syrian
princes
for
in
the
midst
of
magnificent
surroundings
gorgeous
chariots
the
purple
oriflammes
of
the
senate
and
of
elegant
women
and
of
performers
of
theatres
i
distinguished
the
emperor
luxuriously
reclining
in
a
golden
car
clothed
in
silk
covered
with
precious
stones
and
ornaments
in
gold
and
silver
which
glittered
in
the
golden
sunshine
this
must
have
been
heliogabalus
the
priest
of
the
sun
the
coliseum
the
temple
of
antoninus
the
triumphal
arches
and
trajan
column
were
standing
rome
was
in
all
its
ancient
beauty
and
grandeur
that
last
beautiful
phase
which
was
no
more
than
a
scene
in
a
theatre
to
those
crowned
buffoons
a
little
later
i
was
present
at
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
which
overwhelmed
herculaneum
and
pompeii
i
saw
rome
in
flames
just
for
a
moment
and
although
i
was
not
able
to
distinguish
nero
on
his
terrace
i
have
no
doubt
i
beheld
the
conflagration
in
the
year
and
the
signal
for
the
persecution
of
the
christians
a
few
hours
after
my
attention
being
still
occupied
in
examining
the
extensive
gardens
by
the
tiber
i
had
just
seen
the
emperor
near
a
parterre
of
roses
when
in
consequence
of
the
revolution
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
judea
was
presented
to
me
how
anxiously
i
regarded
it
when
i
distinguished
jerusalem
and
the
mountain
of
golgotha
jesus
was
climbing
this
mountain
accompanied
by
a
few
women
escorted
by
a
troop
of
soldiers
and
followed
by
the
jewish
populace
i
shall
never
forget
this
spectacle
it
assumed
a
totally
different
aspect
to
me
from
what
it
did
to
those
who
were
living
at
the
time
and
who
took
part
in
it
for
the
glorious
future
and
the
past
also
of
the
christian
church
was
unfolded
for
me
as
the
crown
of
the
divine
sacrifice
i
can
not
dwell
on
it
you
can
understand
what
various
feelings
agitated
my
soul
on
this
supreme
occasion
a
little
later
returning
to
rome
i
recognised
julius
cæsar
prostrate
in
death
with
antony
beside
him
holding
what
i
think
was
a
roll
of
papyrus
in
his
left
hand
the
conspirators
were
hastening
down
to
the
banks
of
the
tiber
with
a
very
natural
curiosity
i
traced
back
the
life
of
julius
cæsar
and
found
him
with
vercingetorix
in
the
centre
of
gaul
and
i
may
state
that
none
of
the
suppositions
of
our
modern
historians
respecting
the
situation
of
alesia
are
correct
in
fact
this
fortress
was
situated
on
master
pardon
me
for
interrupting
you
but
i
am
anxious
to
seize
this
opportunity
to
question
you
on
a
particular
point
respecting
the
dictator
since
you
have
seen
julius
cæsar
tell
me
i
pray
you
if
his
face
resembles
that
given
by
the
emperor
napoleon
iii
in
his
great
work
on
the
life
of
that
famous
captain
lumen
i
should
be
delighted
my
old
friend
to
enlighten
you
on
this
point
if
it
were
possible
for
me
to
do
so
but
reflect
for
a
moment
and
you
will
see
that
the
laws
of
perspective
forbid
me
quærens
of
perspective
you
mean
to
say
of
politics
lumen
no
of
perspective
although
these
two
things
strongly
resemble
one
another
for
in
seeing
great
men
from
the
height
of
heaven
i
do
not
see
them
as
they
appear
to
the
vulgar
from
the
heavens
we
see
men
geometrically
from
above
not
face
to
face
that
is
to
say
when
they
are
standing
we
have
only
a
horizontal
projection
of
them
you
may
remember
that
once
in
a
balloon
as
we
passed
over
the
vendôme
column
at
paris
you
remarked
to
me
that
napoleon
seen
from
that
height
was
not
above
the
level
of
other
men
it
was
just
the
same

to
continue
however
i
retraced
history
from
julius
cæsar
to
the
consuls
and
then
to
the
kings
of
latium
in
order
to
witness
the
rape
of
the
sabines
which
i
was
pleased
to
observe
actually
as
a
type
of
ancient
manners
history
has
embellished
many
things
and
i
discovered
that
most
events
as
represented
to
us
are
totally
different
from
the
actual
facts
then
i
saw
king
candaules
in
lydia
in
the
scene
in
the
bath
that
you
remember
then
the
invasion
of
egypt
by
the
ethiopians
the
oligarchical
republic
of
corinth
the
eighth
olympiad
in
greece
and
isaiah
the
prophet
in
judea
i
saw
the
building
of
the
pyramids
by
troops
of
obedient
slaves
under
chiefs
mounted
on
dromedaries
the
great
dynasties
of
bactria
and
of
india
appeared
before
me
and
china
showed
the
marvellous
skill
in
the
arts
that
she
possessed
even
before
the
birth
of
the
western
world
i
had
an
opportunity
to
search
for
the
atlantis
of
plato
and
i
saw
that
the
opinions
of
bailly
on
that
continent
now
submerged
are
not
devoid
of
foundation
in
gaul
i
could
distinguish
nothing
but
vast
forests
and
swamps
even
the
druids
had
disappeared
and
the
savage
inhabitants
strongly
resembled
those
that
we
find
now
in
oceania
it
was
truly
the
as
it
is
unearthed
for
us
by
modern
archæologists
further
back
still
i
saw
that
the
number
of
men
diminished
by
degrees
and
the
domination
of
nature
seemed
to
belong
to
a
race
of
the
great
apes
to
the
cave
bears
to
lions
hyenas
and
the
rhinoceros
a
moment
arrived
when
it
was
not
only
impossible
to
distinguish
a
single
man
on
the
surface
of
the
earth
but
when
not
the
least
vestige
of
the
human
race
was
visible
all
had
disappeared
earthquakes
volcanoes
deluges
prevailed
over
the
surface
of
the
planet
and
the
presence
of
man
in
the
midst
of
such
a
chaotic
state
of
things
was
no
longer
possible
quærens
i
shall
confess
to
you
dear
lumen
that
i
have
waited
with
impatience
for
the
moment
when
you
should
arrive
at
the
garden
of
eden
in
order
to
learn
in
what
form
the
creation
of
the
human
race
on
the
earth
was
presented
to
you
i
am
surprised
that
you
do
not
seem
to
have
thought
of
making
this
important
observation
lumen
i
relate
to
you
only
the
things
which
i
saw
my
curious
friend
and
i
refrain
from
substituting
the
dreams
of
my
imagination
for
the
evidences
of
my
sight
i
did
not
perceive
the
least
trace
of
that
eden
so
poetically
depicted
in
the
primitive
theogonies
now
this
was
very
extraordinary
since
the
resemblance
between
the
world
that
i
had
before
my
eyes
and
the
earth
was
so
complete
it
was
more
than
surprising
if
the
terrestrial
paradise
was
really
the
cradle
of
humanity
but
i
do
not
see
why
paradise
might
not
have
been
with
as
good
reason
at
the
end
of
human
society
quærens
indeed
i
think
it
would
be
more
just
to
suppose
it
to
be
at
the
end
rather
than
the
beginning
as
the
result
and
the
recompense
instead
of
the
misunderstood
prelude
to
a
life
of
suffering
but
since
you
have
not
seen
it
i
shall
not
urge
my
question
sidenote
prehistoric
ages
sidenote
a
dying
world
sidenote
the
beginning
not
the
end
of
the
earth
lumen
finally
in
concluding
my
observations
of
this
singular
world
whose
history
was
exactly
the
inverse
of
yours
i
saw
marvellous
animals
of
monstrous
forms
in
combat
on
the
shores
of
vast
oceans
there
were
enormous
serpents
armed
with
formidable
paws
crocodiles
that
flew
in
the
air
sustained
by
wings
organically
longer
than
their
bodies
misshapen
fishes
with
jaws
wide
enough
to
swallow
an
ox
birds
of
prey
struggling
in
terrible
battles
in
the
desert
islands
there
were
whole
continents
covered
with
forests
trees
with
enormous
leaves
entangled
in
one
another
a
vegetation
at
once
sombre
and
severe
for
the
vegetable
kingdom
was
devoid
of
both
flowers
and
fruit
the
mountains
vomited
forth
clouds
of
flame
and
vapour
the
rivers
fell
in
cataracts
the
ground
opened
in
immense
chasms
in
which
were
engulfed
hills
woods
streams
trees
and
animals
but
before
long
it
became
impossible
for
me
to
perceive
even
the
surface
of
the
globe
a
universal
sea
appeared
to
cover
it
and
the
vegetable
kingdom
like
the
animal
kingdom
was
slowly
effaced
and
gave
place
to
a
monotonous
verdure
interspersed
with
lightning
and
whitish
smoke
henceforth
it
was
a
dying
world
i
was
present
at
the
last
palpitations
of
its
heart
intermittently
revealed
in
the
gloom
by
flashes
of
flame
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
rained
everywhere
over
its
whole
surface
for
the
sun
threw
light
on
nothing
but
clouds
and
torrents
of
rain
the
hemisphere
opposite
to
the
sun
appeared
less
sombre
than
before
and
one
could
perceive
a
dull
light
gleaming
through
the
tempests
this
light
increased
in
intensity
and
spread
over
the
entire
sphere
great
crevasses
became
red
like
iron
in
the
furnace
and
as
iron
in
a
hot
furnace
becomes
bright
red
then
orange
then
yellow
then
in
succession
white
and
incandescent
so
the
world
passed
through
all
the
progressive
phases
of
heat
its
volume
increased
its
movement
of
rotation
became
slower
the
mysterious
globe
seemed
like
an
immense
sphere
of
molten
metal
enveloped
in
metallic
vapours
under
the
incessant
action
of
this
interior
furnace
and
the
elemental
combats
or
combinations
of
this
strange
chemistry
it
acquired
enormous
proportions
and
the
sphere
of
fire
became
a
sphere
of
smoke
thence
it
went
on
developing
without
cessation
and
lost
its
personality
the
sun
which
at
first
had
shed
light
on
it
no
longer
surpassed
it
in
brightness
and
it
itself
increased
so
much
in
circumference
that
it
became
evident
to
me
that
the
vaporous
planet
would
soon
lose
its
own
existence
and
be
absorbed
in
the
enlarged
atmosphere
of
the
sun
it
is
a
rare
experience
to
be
present
at
the
end
of
a
world
and
so
in
my
enthusiasm
i
could
not
prevent
myself
from
crying
out
with
a
kind
of
vanity
behold
the
end
of
the
world
o
god
and
this
then
is
the
fate
in
store
for
all
the
inhabited
worlds
this
is
not
replied
a
voice
in
the
hearing
of
my
soul
is
the
how
can
this
be
the
beginning
thought
i
immediately
the
beginning
of
the
earth
itself
replied
the
same
voice
thou
hast
seen
over
again
the
whole
history
of
the
earth
thus
withdrawing
from
her
with
a
velocity
greater
than
that
of
this
declaration
did
not
surprise
me
so
much
as
the
first
episode
of
my
life
for
i
was
now
familiarised
with
the
astonishing
effects
of
the
laws
of
light
i
was
henceforth
prepared
for
every
new
surprise
i
had
some
doubts
of
the
fact
in
consequence
of
certain
details
that
i
have
not
given
you
to
avoid
disturbing
the
unity
of
my
recital
or
breaking
the
thread
of
my
narrative
but
which
were
nevertheless
incomparably
more
extraordinary
than
the
general
succession
of
events
quærens
but
if
it
was
really
the
earth
how
comes
it
that
the
astronomical
calculations
you
made
in
order
to
recognise
her
in
the
constellation
of
the
altar
indicated
as
you
have
pointed
out
that
the
world
you
were
examining
was
neither
the
earth
nor
a
star
of
the
altar
sidenote

retraced
sidenote

perspective
lumen
the
fact
is
that
even
that
constellation
had
itself
changed
in
consequence
of
my
voyage
in
space
in
place
of
the
stars
of
the
third
magnitude
α
γ
and
ϛ
alpha
gamma

and
stars
of
the
fourth

β

and
θ

which
constitute
that
figure
as
seen
from
the
earth
my
distance
towards
the
nebulæ
had
reduced
those
starsa
to
little
imperceptible
points
it
had
placed
other
brilliant

there
which
were
no

perhaps
even
ε

diametrically
opposite
to
the
preceding

seen
from
the
earth
but
which
were
necessarily
interposed
there
when
i
had
passed
them
by
the
celestial

had
already
changed
and
it
had
become
in
truth
almost
impossible
to
determine
the
position
of
our
sun
sidenote
it
was
really
the
earth
that
lumen
saw
quærens
i
had
not
thought
of
this
inevitable
change
of
perspective
on
the
other
side
of
capella
and
so
it
was
really
the
earth
that
you
saw
and
therefore
its
history
was
unrolled
before
you
in
an
inverse
order
you
saw
ancient
events
taking
place
modern
events
by
what
new
process
has
light
thus
enabled
you
to
ascend
the
stream
of
time
furthermore
dear
lumen
you
have
informed
me
that
you
have
observed
some
curious
particulars
relative
to
the
earth
itself
i
am
wishful
to
ask
you
some
special
questions
on
these
details
i
shall
listen
then
with
interest
to
the
extraordinary
history
which
ought
to
complete
this
recital
persuaded
as
before
that
it
will
fully
reward
my
curiosity
ii

read

the
first
circumstance
is
connected
with
the
battle
of
waterloo
quærens
no
one
remembers
that
catastrophe
better
than
i
do
i
received
a
ball
in

in

of

a
on

lumen
well
my
old
comrade
in
taking
part
in
this
battle
again
i
found
it
quite
different
from
what
it
was
in
the
past
as
you
may
judge
from
what
i
will
relate
to
you
when
i
had
recognised
the
field
of
waterloo
to
the
south
of
brussels
i
distinguished
first
a
considerable
number
of
dead
bodies
lying
on
the
ground
indiscriminately
far
off
through
the
mist
i
perceived
napoleon
walking
backwards
holding
his
horse
by
the
bridle
the
officers
who
accompanied
him
were
marching
backwards
also
the
cannon
began
to
boom
and
from
time
to
time
i
saw
the
lurid
gleam
of
their
flashes
when
my
sight
was
sufficiently
habituated
to
the
scene
i
perceived
some
soldiers
coming
to
life
out
of
the
eternal
night
and
by
a
single
effort
standing
up
group
after
group
a
considerable
number
were
thus
resuscitated
the
dead
horses
revived
like
the
dead
cavaliers
and
the
latter
remounted
them
as
soon
as
two
or
three
thousand
men
had
returned
to
life
i
saw
them
form
unconsciously
in
line
of
battle
the
two
armies
took
their
places
fronting
one
another
and
began
to
fight
desperately
with
a
fury
that
one
might
have
taken
for
despair
as
the
combat
deepened
on
both
sides
the
soldiers
came
to
life

rapidly

arose
from

and
fought
in
the
centre
of

french
army
i
espied
the
emperor
a
battalion
in
square
surrounded
him
the
imperial
guard
was
resuscitated
their
immense
battalions
advanced
from
the
two
camps
and
engaged
in

and
from
the

advanced
the
white

of
the

i
remembered
the

of

for

combatants

raised
from
the
dead
besides
in
this
singular
apparition
they
marched
backwards
one
against
the
other
such
a
battle
had
a
magical
effect
and
impressed
me
more
forcibly
because
i
foresaw
the
event
itself
and
this
event
was
strangely
transformed
in
its
counterpart
image
not
less
singular
was
the
fact
that
the
longer
they
fought
the
more
the
number
of
combatants
increased
at
each
gap
made
by
the
cannon
in
the
serried
ranks
a
group
of
resuscitated
dead
filled
up
the
gaps
immediately
when
the
belligerents
had
spent
the
whole
day
in
tearing
one
another
to
pieces
with
with
cannons
and
bullets
with
bayonets
sabres
and
swords
when
the
great
battle
was
over
there
was
not
a
single
person
killed
no
one
was
even
wounded
even
uniforms
that
before
it
were
torn
and
in
disorder
were
in
good
condition
the
men
were
safe
and
sound
and
the
ranks
in
correct
form
the
two
armies
slowly
withdrew
from
one
another
as
if
the
heat
of
the
battle
and
all
its
fury
had
no
other
object
than
the
restoration
to
life
amid
the
smoke
of
the
combat
of
the
two
hundred
thousand
corpses
which
had
lain
on
the
field
a
few
hours
before
what
an
exemplary
and
desirable
battle
it
was
sidenote
reascending
the
ages
assuredly
it
was
the
most
singular
of
military
episodes
and
the
moral
aspect
of
it
far
surpassed
the
physical
when
i
found
that
this
battle
resulted
not
in
the
defeat
of
napoleon
but
in
placing
him
upon
the
throne
instead
of
losing
the
battle
it
was
the
emperor
who
gained
it
instead
of
a
prisoner
he
became
a
sovereign
waterloo
was
an
brumaire
quærens
dear
lumen
i
do
not
half
understand
this
new
effect
of
the
laws
of
light
if
you
have
discovered
it
i
shall
be
grateful
to
you
if
you
will
give
me
an
explanation
of
it
lumen
i
have
helped
you
to
divine
it
by
telling
you
that
i
removed
from
the
earth
with
a
velocity
than
that
of
light
quærens
but
tell
me
i
pray
you
how
does
this
retrogression
in
space
enable
you
to
see
events
in
an
order
inverse
to
that
in
which
they
took
place
lumen
the
theory
is
very
simple
suppose
you
set
out
from
the
earth
with
the
velocity
exactly
to
that
of
light
you
would
always
have
with
you
the
aspect
that
the
earth
assumed
at
the
moment
you
set
out
since
you
would
be
receding
from
the
globe
with
a
swiftness
precisely
equal
to
that
which
bore
this
very
aspect
into
space
thus
even
if
you
voyaged
for
a
thousand
years
or
a
hundred
thousand
years
this
aspect
would
accompany
you
always
like
a
photograph
which
did
not
grow
old
whilst
the
original
is
made
old
by
the
years
that
elapse
quærens
i
understood
this
fact
already
in
our
first
conversation
sidenote
retrogressive
light
pictures
lumen
well
suppose
now
that
you
remove
from
the
earth
with
a
velocity
to
that
of
light
what
will
happen
you
will
find
again
as
fast
as
you
advance
into
space
the
rays
that
set
out
you
that
is
to
say
the
successive
photographs
which
from
second
to
second
from
instant
to
instant
project
their
rays
into
space
if
for
example
you
set
out
in
with
the
velocity
equal
to
that
of
light
you
would
retain
for
ever
the
year
in
sight
if
you
went
more
quickly
you
would
find
before
you
the
rays
that
had
set
out
in
former
years
and
which
bore
upon
them
the
photographs
of
those
years
in
order
further
to
illustrate
this
fact
reflect
i
pray
you
on
the
many
luminous
rays
that
have
set
out
from
the
earth
in
different
epochs
let
us
suppose
the
first
to
be
at
some
instant
of
the
january
at
the
rate
of
kilometres
a
second
it
has
at
the
moment
in
which
i
am
speaking
to
you
already
passed
a
portion
of
space
from
the
instant
of
its
departure
till
it
reached
a
certain
distance
which
i
shall
express
by
the
letter
a
let
us
now
suppose
that
a
second
ray
sets
out
from
the
earth
a
hundred
years
before
on
the
january
it
is
a
hundred
years
of
the
first
and
is
found
at
a
still
greater
distance
a
distance
that
i
shall
express
by
the
letter
b
a
third
ray
which
i
shall
in
like
manner
suppose
on
the
january
is
still
by
a
length
equal
to
the
distance
that
the
light
would
travel
in
a
hundred
years

call
the
place
where
this
third
ray
reaches
then
a
fourth

fifth

sixth
on
respectively

january
are
posted
at
equal
distances
d
e
f
penetrating
more
and
more
into
the
infinite
here
then
we
have
a
series
of
photographs
taken
on
the
same
line
from
post
to
post
in

now
the
mind
which
travels
on
in
passing
successively
by
the

can
retrace

the

of

at
what
distance
are
these
photographs
from
one
another
sidenote
photographs
of
the
life
on

imprinted
in

lumen
the
calculation
is
very
easy
the
interval
which
separates
them
is
of
necessity
that
which
light
travels
in
a
hundred
years
now
at
the
rate
of
leagues
per
second
you
see
at
once
that
it
travels
leagues
in
a
leagues
in
an
leagues
in
a
in
a
allowing
for
consequently
the
result
would
be
that
the
interval
between
two
points
of
departure
at
the
distance
of
a
from
one
another
is
nearly
thousand
millions
of
leagues
here
then
i
say
we
have
a
series
of
terrestrial
photographs
imprinted
in
space
at
corresponding
distances
one
after
another
let
us
now
suppose
that
between
each
of
these
centennial
pictures
we
should
find
annual
pictures
between
each
of
which
the
distance
is
preserved
in
accordance
with
the
time
that
light
travels
in
a
year
which
i
have
just
given
you
then
between
each
of
the
annual
pictures
we
have
those
of
every
day
and
as
each
day
contains
the
photographs
of
each
hour
every
hour
the
photographs
of
its
minutes
and
every
minute
of
its
seconds
all
succeeding
one
another
according
to
their
respective
distances
apart
we
shall
have
in
a
ray
of
light
or
rather
in
a
jet
of
light
composed
of
a
series
of
distinct
pictures
in
juxtaposition

aerial
register
of
the
history
of
the
earth
sidenote
psychical
optics
when
the
spirit
travels
in
this
ethereal
ray
of
pictures
with
a
swiftness
greater
than
that
of
light
it
sees
in
succession
backwards
the
ancient
pictures
when
it
arrives
at
the
distance
at
which
the
aspect
of
events
that
set
out
in
is
to
be
seen
it
has
already
retraced
a
hundred
years
of
terrestrial
history
when
it
reaches
the
point
where
the
aspect
of
has
arrived
it
retraces
two
centuries
when
it
attains
to
the
photograph
of
it
has
seen
again
three
centuries
and
so
on
successively
i
told
you
in
the
beginning
that
i
directed
my
course
toward
a
group
of
stars
situated
at
the
left
of
capella
this
group
proved
to
be
at
an
incomparably
greater
distance
than
that
star
although
from
the
earth
it
appeared
to
be
close
beside
it
because
the
two
visual
rays
are
near
one
another
this
apparent
proximity
is
solely
due
to
the
perspective
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
remoteness
of
this
universe
i
may
tell
you
that
it
is
not
less
vast
in
size
than
the
milky
way
one
may
then
ask
to
what
distance
should
the
milky
way
be
transported
to
reduce
it
to
the
apparent
size
of
this
nebula
my
learned
friend
arago
made
this
calculation
of
which
you
must
be
aware
as
he
repeated
it
every
year
in
his
course
of
lectures
at
the
observatory
that
have
been
published
since
his
death
it
would
be
necessary
to
suppose
the
milky
way
to
be
transported
to
a
distance
equal
to
times
its
own
length
now
as
light
takes
years
to
traverse
the
milky
way
from
one
end
to
another
it
follows
that
it
can
not
take
less
than
times
years
that
is
to
say
less
than
years
in
coming
from
thence
i
have
ascended
a
ray
of
light
from
the
earth
to
these
remote
regions
and
if
my
spiritual
sight
had
been
more
perfect
i
should
have
been
able
to
distinguish
not
only
the
retrogression
of
history
for
years
or
years
but
even
for
years
quærens
can
the
mind
then
by
its
powers
alone
cross
in
this
way
the
immeasurable
spaces
of
the
heavens
lumen
not
by
its
own
power
alone
but
by
making
use
of
the
forces
of
nature
attraction
is
one
of
these
forces
it
is
transmitted
with
a
velocity
incomparably
superior
to
that
of
light
and
the
most
rigorously
exact
astronomical
calculations
are
obliged
to
consider
this
transmission
as
almost
instantaneous
i
will
add
that
if
i
have
been
able
to
perceive
events
at
such
distances
it
is
not
by
the
apprehension
of
a
physical
sense
that
i
know
them
but
by
a
process
incomparably
more
subtle
which
belongs
to
the
psychic
order
the
movements
of
the
ether
which
constitute
light
are
not
luminous
by
themselves
as
you
know
the
eye
is
not
necessary
in
order
to
perceive
them
a
soul
vibrating
under
their
influence
perceives
them
as
well
and
often
incomparably
better
than
an
organic
optical
apparatus
this
being
psychical
optics
for
example
attraction
crosses
instantaneously
the
of
kilometres
that
separate
the
earth
from
the
sun
whilst
light
occupies
seconds
in
this
passage
quærens
what
length
of
time
did
your
voyage
to
that
remote
universe
occupy
lumen
have
i
not
told
you
that
time
does
not
exist
outside
the
movements
of
the
earth
whether
i
employed
a
year
or
an
hour
it
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
period
in
infinity
quærens
i
have
thought
it
over
and
the
physical
difficulties
seem
to
me
enormous
permit
me
now
to
submit
to
you
a
strange
thought
that
has
just
come
into
my
head
lumen
it
is
to
hear
your
reflections
that
i
give
you
this
narrative
quærens
i
want
to
ask
you
if
the
same
inversion
would
take
place
with
the
hearing
as
well
as
the
sight
if
you
can
see
an
event
backwards
from
its
real
occurrence
can
you
also
hear
a
discourse
backwards
beginning
at
the
end
this
is
perhaps
a
daring
question
and
apparently
ridiculous
but
in
paradoxes
where
can
one
stop
sidenote
light
and
sound
lumen
the
paradox
is
only
apparent
the
laws
of
sound
are
essentially
different
from
the
laws
of
light
sound
travels
only
at
the
rate
of
metres
a
second
and
its
effects
have
absolutely
nothing
in
common
with
those
of
light
nevertheless
it
is
evident
that
if
we
were
to
advance
into
the
air
with
a
velocity
to
that
of
sound
we
should
hear
inversely
the
sounds
that
left
the
lips
of
a
speaker
if
for
instance
some
one
were
to
recite
an
alexandrine
an
auditor
in
moving
with
the
aforesaid
velocity
starting
at
the
moment
when
he
heard
the
last
foot
of
the
line
would
find
successively
the
eleven
other
feet
which
had
been
uttered
before
and
would
thus
hear
the
alexandrine
backwards
as
to
the
theory
itself
it
suggests
a
curious
reflection
that
nature
might
have
caused
sound
to
travel
not
at
the
rate
of
metres
a
second
and
that
its
velocity
which
depends
on
the
density
and
the
elasticity
of
the
air
might
have
been
very
much
less
why
for
instance
might
it
not
have
been
transmitted
at
the
rate
of
only
a
few
centimetres
a
second
now
see
what
would
be
the
result
if
this
were
the
case
men
would
not
be
able
to
speak
to
one
another
when
walking
together
let
two
friends
be
conversing
and
suppose
one
takes
a
step
or
two
in
advance
or
goes
on
say
the
distance
of
a
metre
now
if
sound
were
to
take
many
seconds
to
cross
this
metre
the
consequence
would
be
that
instead
of
hearing
the
phrases
spoken
in
their
right
order
by
his
friend
the
foremost
walker
would
hear
in
an
inverse
order
the
sounds
conveying
the
anterior
phrases
in
that
case
we
could
not
speak
whilst
walking
and
of
mankind
would
not
be
able
to
hear
one
another
these
remarks
my
friend
induce
me
to
suggest
to
you
in
this
connection
for
your
consideration
a
subject
well
worthy
of
attention
and
which
has
hitherto
received
little
notice
that
of
the
adaptation
of
the
human
organism
to
its
terrestrial
environment
the
manner
in
which
man
sees
in
which
he
hears
his
sensations
his
nervous
system
his
build
his
weight
his
density
his
walk
his
functions
in
a
word
all
his
actions
are
regulated
and
constituted
by
the
condition
of
your
planet
none
of
your
acts
are
absolutely
free
and
independent
man
is
the
obedient
though
unconscious
creature
of
the
organic
forces
of
the
earth
sidenote
the
human
organism
derived
from
the
earth
sidenote
organic
life
accords
with
its
habitat
on
each
planet
undoubtedly
the
human
soul
not
being
a
function
of
the
brain
and
existing
by
itself
enjoys
relative
liberty
but
this
liberty
is
limited
by
its
faculties
its
powers
and
its
energies
it
is
determined
according
to
the
causes
which
decide
it
at
the
moment
of
the
birth
of
every
man
could
one
know
exactly
the
faculties
of
his
soul
and
the
circumstances
which
were
to
surround
his
life
one
could
write
beforehand
that
man

in
all
its

the

is
the

is
not

a
miracle

by

that
terrestrial

as
he
is

your

food
that
nourishes
you
the
gravity
of
the
surface

earth
the
density
of
terrestrial
matter
the
human
body
does
not
differ
anatomically
from
that
of
one
of
the
higher
mammalia
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
origin
of
species
you
will
find
gradual
transformations
established
by
unimpeachable
evidence
the
whole
of
terrestrial
life
from
the
mollusc
to
man
is
the
development
of
one
single
and
sole
genealogical
tree
the
human
form
has
its
origin
in
the
animal
form
man
is
the
butterfly
developed
from
the
chrysalis
of
the
palæontological
ages

this
fact

consequence

that
on
other
worlds
organic
life
is
different
from
what
it
is
here

that
their
humanities
which
like
our
own
are
the
result
of
forces

absolutely

do
not

my

you
would
believe
impenetrable

formed
of
molecules
between
which
rays
of

frequently
pass
in
the
contrary
case
there
are
here

there
vistas

one
can

see
obliquely
the
case
is
very
rare
when
nothing
can
be
distinguished
besides
light
is
not
what
it
appears
to
be
it
is
a
vibration
of
ether

there
are
other
ways
of
seeing

of
the
retina

that
all
the
objections

can
at

very
instant
open
your

to
see
the
utter
inadequacy
of
your
terrestrial
faculties
and
the
fatal
poverty
of
positive
science
itself
by
inviting
you
to
reflect
that
the
causes
of
your
impressions
are
solely
modes
of
motion
and
that
what
is
proudly
termed
is
only
a
very
organic
sidenote
the
limitations
of
the
senses
light
by
which
your
eyes
see

which
your

motion

which
you
are
impressed
odours
flavours

emanations
which
strike
upon
your
olfactory
nerve

touch
your
palate
these
are
solely
vibratory
motions
which
are
transmitted
to
your
brain
you
can
only
appreciate
a
few
of
these
movements
through
the
senses
you
possess
principally
those
of
sight
and
hearing
you
in
your
simplicity
believe
that
you
see
and
hear
nature
nothing
of
the
kind
all
you
do
is
to
receive
some
of
the
movements
in
activity
upon
your
sublunary
atom

is
all
beyond
the
impressions
you
receive

are
an
infinitely
greater
number
unperceived

pardon

this

this
aspect
is
indeed
new
to
you

attentive
reflection
will
enable
you
to
grasp
it
sound
is
formed
by
vibrations
in
the
air
which
strike
upon
the
membrane
of
the
tympanum
and
give
you
the
impression
of
various
tones
man
does
not
hear
all
sounds
when
the
vibrations
are
too
slow

forty
a

the
sound
is
too
low
your
ear
can
not
catch
it

rapid

second
the
sound

too
sharp
your
ear
can
not
receive
it
above

below
these
two
limits
therefore
human
beings
do
not
perceive
them
these
vibrations
exist
however
and
are
perceived
by
creatures
of
other
kinds
as
for
example
certain
insects
the
same
rules
apply
to
light
the
different
aspects
of
light
the
shades
and
colours
of
objects
are
equally
due
to
the
vibrations
which
strike
upon
the
optic
nerve

give
you
the
impression
of
the
different
degrees
of
intensity

very
existence
you
can
not

guess

in

you
would
be
conscious
of
the

of

everywhere
about
you
but
although
thus
ignorant
you
are
unconscious
of
it

all
around
you

your

it
would
see
the

you
do
possess
suffice
however
to
indicate
the
existence
of
other
senses
not
only
more
powerful
but
of
a
totally
different
order
by
the
sense
of
touch
for
example
you
can
it
is
true
feel
the
sensation
of
but
it
is
easy
to
conceive
the
existence
of
a
special
sense
analogous
to
that
by
which
light
reveals
to
you
the
aspect
of
exterior
objects
and
which
would
render
man
capable
of
judging
of
the

of
an
object

interior
structure
and
other
qualities
by
the
action
of
the
caloric

radiating
from
it
the

reasoning
would
hold
good
on
the
subject
of
you
could
equally
well
conceive
the
existence
of
a
sense
endowing
the
eye
with
the
powers
of

enabling
it
to
see
the
elements
of
which

are
composed
thus
already
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
you
have
sufficient
ground
for
imagining
modes
of
perception
quite
different
from
those
which
characterise
human
beings

faculties
exist
in
other

there
are
endless

perceiving
the

master
i
own
that
as
you
unfold
these
possibilities
a
new
and
singular
clearness
enlightens
my
understanding

your
teachings
appear
to
me
a
true
interpretation
of
the
reality
i
had
already
dreamed
that
similar
marvels
might
be
possible
but
i
had
not
been
able
to
explain
them
enveloped
as
i
still
am
in
my
terrestrial

thing
is
certain
we
must
be
lifted
out
of
our
limitations
ere
we
are
capable
of
comprehending
or
even
of
attempting
to
judge
of
the
scope
of
the
universe
thus
being
endowed
with
only
a
few
limited
senses

can
but
know
the
facts
that
are
perceptible

the
remainder
is
naturally
unknown

it
be

the
unknown
is
infinitely
more

the
known
sidenote
the
ordinary
senses
are
insensible
to
many
physical
movements

this
remainder
is
immense
and
all
you
at

know
will
seem
as
nothing
by
comparison
not
only
do
your
senses
not
perceive
physical
movements
such
as
solar

terrestrial
electricity

currents
cross
in
the
atmosphere

still

and
antipathies

only
speak
the
simple
truth
when
i
say
that
all
that
you
know

all
that
you
could
know
through
the
medium
of
your
earthly

is
as
nothing

to
that
which
is
sidenote

exist
with
other
than

this
truth
is
so
profound
that
it
might
well
be
asserted
that
beings
exist
upon
the
earth
essentially
different
from
you
possessing
neither
eyes
nor
ears
nor
any
of
your

endowed
with
senses

capable
of
perceiving
that
which
you
can
not
perceive

who
while
living
in
the

as
yourself
know
that
which
you
can
not
know

an
idea
of

completely
at

with
your
own
quærens
all
this
is
utterly
beyond
my
comprehension

moreover
my
earthly
friend
i
can
add
most
emphatically
that
the

the
senses

are
represented
to
you
by
their

not
even
by
the
essence
of
the
things

of

entirely
escapes
your

you
are
utterly

much
more

suppose
one
could
make
signs
from
the
earth
to
a
star
by
employing
the
light
for
example
a
hundred
years
must
come
and
go
before
the
signal
from
the
earth
could
reach
its
destination

response
could
only
return

interval

had
elapsed

centuries

consequently
elapse

the
question
and
its
answer
the
terrestrial
observer
would
have
died
long
before
his
signal
could
have
reached
his
sidereal
observer
and
the
latter
would
doubtless
have
undergone
a
similar
fate
before
his
answer
could
have
been
received

of
others

which
specially
interest
us

a
thousand
years

delightful
hours
passed
together
on
the
earth

would
rush
into
space
with
a
rapidity

to
that
of
light
in

to
have
always
before
their
eyes
the

hours

should
some
unexpected
situation
have
presented
itself

could
at
leisure
examine
the
causes
leading
to
the

he
might
even
if
his
disembodied
companion
resided
in
some
neighbouring
region

upon
her
to
observe
in
common
with
himself

retrospective
incidents

denial
could
be
admissible
before

evidence

might
not
this
power
exercised
by
these
spirits
give
rise
to

strange
revelations

you
are
very
earthly
my
friend
to
think
that
in
the
heavens
memories
of
a
material
kind
will
be
valued
and
i
am
astonished
that
you
can
continue
to
think
them
of
importance
what
should
specially
strike
you
in
all
we
have
said
during
these
two
interviews
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
laws
of
light
we
can
see
events
after
they
have
been
accomplished
although
they
are
past
and
indeed
when
they
have
entirely
vanished
quærens
believe
me

this
truth
will
never

be
effaced
from
my
memory
it
is
precisely
this
point
which
i
find
so
exceedingly
marvellous

i
pray
you
my
last
digression
to
say
the
truth
that
which
from
our
first
interview
has
most
taxed
and
surpassed
the
bounds
of
my
imagination
was
to
think
that
the
duration
of
the
voyage
of
the
spirit
can
be
not
only
negative
but
also
sidenote

will
arrive
there
years

a
hundred

farther
you
go

in

be
remade

extraordinary
reckoning

this
is
undeniable
speaking
according
to
terrestrial
style
there
is
not
any
error
in
this
mode
of
expression

a
telegram
sent
from
paris
at
noon
arrives
at
brest
twenty
minutes
before
noon
but
these
curious
aspects
of
particular
application
are
not
of
sufficient
significance
for
you
to
dwell
upon
but
rather
the
of
which
they
are
the
metaphysical
form
and
the
outward
expression
know
that
time
is
not
an
absolute
reality

only
a
transitory
measure

by
the

from
the
point
of
view
of
the
whole

the
present

no
longer
a
momentary
actuality
which
disappears
as
soon
as
it
has
appeared
it
is
no

is
true
of

thus
the
entire
history
of
the
whole

can
be
present
at
once
to
the
universal
ubiquity
of
the
creator
i
may
add
that

knows
all

in

also
by

and

far
as
it
can
go

way

passes
successively
from
one
region
in
space
to
another
at
a
greater
distance
and
travels
without
being
extinguished

the
realms

infinity

we
could
see
from
the
earth

event
which
is
being
accomplished
upon

instance

we
had
sufficiently
good
instruments
to
perceive
from
here
a
fruit
falling
from
a
tree
on
the
surface
of
the
moon
we
should
not
see
the
fact
at
the
of
its
but
one
second
and
a
quarter
because
light
requires
about
that
time
to
travel
the
distance
from
the
moon
to
the
earth
similarly
could
we
see
an
event
taking
place
upon
a
world
at
ten
times
greater
distance
than

we
could
not

really
happened

were
a

could
not

therefore
that

see
only

principles

are
to
my

clearly
established

day
after
your
death
in
october
when
as
you
have
confided
to
me
you
found
yourself
rapidly
transported
to
capella
you
were
astonished
to
arrive
there
at
the
moment
when
the
philosophical
astronomers
of
the
country
were
observing
the
earth
in
the
year
and
witnessing
one
of
the
most
significant
acts
of
the
french
revolution
you
were
not
less
surprised
to
see
yourself
again
as
a
child
running
about
in
the
streets
of
paris
then
leaving
capella
and
coming
nearer
to
the
earth
you
arrived
at
the
zone
where
that
part
of
the
terrestrial
photography
passed
before
your
vision
which
showed
you
your
infancy
and
you
saw
yourself
at
six
years
of
age
not
in
memory
but
in
reality
out
of
all
your
previous
revelations
this
is
the
one
i
had
the
most
difficulty
in
believing
i
mean
in
grasping
its
meaning
lumen
that
which
i
now
wish
to
make
you
comprehend
is
stranger
still
but
it
was
first
necessary
for
you
to
admit
that
one
before
i
could
adequately
reveal
to
you
this
one
sidenote
retrospective
survey
of
life
on
earth
on
leaving
capella
and
approaching
the
earth
i
saw
again
my
years
of
earthly
existence
my
entire
life
such
as
it
had
been
passed
before
me
for
in
approaching
the
earth
i
passed
through
successive
zones
of
earthly
scenes
where
i
saw
spread
out
as
in
a
scroll
the
visible
history
of
our
planet
because
in
going
back
towards
the
earth
i
was
continually
meeting
the
various
zones
which
carried
through
space
the
visible
history
of
our
planet
comprising
that
of
paris
as
well
as
my
own
for
i
was
there
taking
thus
in
one
day
a
retrospective
survey
of
the
road
which
it
had
taken
light
years
to
traverse
i
had
reviewed
my
whole
life
in
that
one
day
and
i
perceived
even
my
own
interment
quærens
it
is
as
if
on
returning
from
capella
to
the
earth
you
had
seen
as
in
a
mirror

years
of
your
life
photographed

one

farthest
from
the
earth
but
which
had
started
the
first
and
was
the
oldest

they
were
in

left

later

fiftieth

those
of

it
is
impossible
to
have
better
grasped
these
facts
which
seem
so
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
at
first
sight
now
i
can
recount
to
you
that
which
happened
to
me
upon
capella
after
having
thus
witnessed
over
again
my
existence
on
the
earth
i
lumen
whilst
not
very
long
ago
but
i
can
no
longer
express
that
time
by
earthly
measurements
in
a
melancholy
region
of
capella
i
was
contemplating
the
starry
heavens
at
the
beginning
of
a
clear
night
occupied
in
noting
the
star
which
is
your
earthly
sun
and
near
it
the
little
azure
planet
your
earth
i
observed
one
of
the
scenes
of
my
childhood
my
young
mother
seated
in
the
midst
of
a
garden
holding
an
infant
in
her
arms
my
brother
having
at
her
side
a
little
girl
of
two
summers
my
sister
and
a
boy
two
years
older
myself
i
saw
myself
at
that
age
when
man
is
not
yet
conscious
of
his
intellectual
existence
though
he
bears
even
then
upon
his
brow
the
germ
of
future
promise
whilst
dreaming
of
this
singular
spectacle
which
showed
myself
at
the
entrance
of
my
earthly
career
i
felt
my
attention
drawn
from
your
planet
by
a
superior
power
and
directed
towards
another
point
in
the
heavens
which
even
at
that
moment
seemed
to
be
linked
with
the
earth
and
my
career
there
by
some
mysterious
tie
i
could
not
turn
my
gaze
from
this
new
point
in
the
the
heavens
my
eyes
being
as
it
were
chained
to
the
spot
by
some
magnetic
power
i
was
unable
to
resist
several
times
i
endeavoured
to
withdraw
my
eyes
and
to
fix
them
on
the
earth
i
love
so
well
but
in
vain
for
i
was
ever
to
the
same
unknown
star
sidenote
the
star
gamma
in
virgo
sidenote
life
on
the
planet
of
virgo
this
star
upon
which
my
eyes
sought
instinctively
to
divine
something
belongs
to
the
constellation
of
whose
form
varies
slightly
as
seen
from
capella
it
is
a
double
star
that
is
to
say
an
association
of
two
suns
one
of
a
silvery
whiteness
the
other
of
a
bright
golden
yellow
which
revolve
round
one
another
once
in
years
this
star
can
be
seen
from
the
earth
with
the
naked
eye
and
its
sign
is
the
letter
γ
in
the
constellation
of
virgo
around
each
of
the
suns
which
form
it
there
is
a
planetary
system
my
sight
was
fixed
upon
one
of
the
planets
belonging
to
the
golden
sun
on
that
planet
there
are
animals
and
vegetables
as
upon
the
earth
their
forms
bear
a
similarity
to
earthly
ones
although
there
is
an
essential
difference
in
their
organisms
their
animal
kingdom
is
analogous
to
yours
they
have
fishes
in
the
seas
quadrupeds
in
the
air
in
which
men
can
fly
without
wings
by
reason
of
the
extreme
density
of
the
atmosphere
the
men
of
this
planet
possess
almost
the
same
form
as
those
on
the
earth
but
no
hair
grows
upon
their
heads
and
they
have
three
large
thin
thumbs
instead
of
five
fingers
on
their
hands
and
three
great
toes
at
the
heel
in
place
of
soles
to
their
feet
the
extremities
of
their
arms
and
legs
being
supple
as
they
have
nevertheless
two
eyes
a
nose
and
a
mouth
which
give
them
their
resemblance
to
earthly
beings
they
have
not
two
ears
one
on
each
side
of
the
head
but
one
only
in
the
shape
of
a
cone
which
is
placed
on
the
upper
part
of
the
skull
like
a
little
hat
they
live
in
societies
and
wear
clothing
thus
you
see
in
their
exterior
they
differ
little
from
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
quærens
are
there
then
in
other
worlds
beings
entirely
distinct
from
us
but
who
notwithstanding
their
dissimilarities
can
be
compared
with
us
lumen
a
distinction
profound
and
unimaginable
by
you
separates
in
general
the
animal
life
of
the
different
worlds

are
the
result
of
elements
special
to
each
globe
and
of
the
forces
which
regulate

differ
essentially
on
each
globe
even
in
the
same
system
these
forms
differ
sidenote
the
system
of
gamma
in
virgo
thus
the
men
of
uranus
and
mercury
do
not
in
any
way
resemble
the
men
of
the
earth
those
who
see
them
for
the
first
time
can
not
perceive
that
they
possess
either
head
members
or
senses
on
the
contrary
the
forms
of
those
in
the
planetary
system
of
virgo
towards
which
my
attention
was
being
persistently
drawn
are
nearly
similar
to
those
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
whom
they
also
resemble
morally
and
intellectually
slightly
inferior
to
ourselves
they
belong
to
that
scale
in
the
order
of
souls
which
immediately
precedes
that
of
terrestrial
humanity
as
a
whole
yet
there
is
a
wide
divergence
between
human
beings
themselves
in
all
that
pertains
both
to
intellect
and
morals
we
in
europe
differ
greatly
from
the
tribes
of
abyssinia
and
from
the
savages
of
the
oceanic
isles
what
people
do
you
take
as
a
type
of
the
highest
degree
of
intelligence
on
the
earth
sidenote
the
arabs
and
their
intelligence
lumen
the
arabs
they
are
capable
of
producing
their
keplers
their
newtons
their
galileos
their
archimedes
their
euclids
their
besides
they
sprang
from
those
primitive
hordes
whose
roots
reach
down
to
the
bed

of
humanity
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
choose
a
people
for
a
type
it
is
better
to
consider
modern
civilisation
as
a
whole
nor
is
there
so
marked
a
distance
as
you
appear
to
suppose
between
the
brain

of
a
negro
and
that
of
the
latin
race
however
if
you
insist
upon
a
comparison
i
can
assure
you
that
the
men
of
the
planet
of
virgo
are
almost
on
a
par
intellectually
with
the
scandinavians
sidenote
vital
difference
between
virgo
and
the
earth
the
most
vital
difference
which
exists
between
their
world
and
the
earth
the
absence
of
neither
plants
animals
nor
human
beings

sex
generation
is
effected
spontaneously
as
the
natural
result
of
the
union
of
certain
physiological
conditions
in
some
of
the
fertile
isles
of
this
planet
man
not
being
formed
in
the
womb
of
his
mother
as
upon
earth
it
would
be
useless
to
explain
the
process
to
one
whose
earthly
faculties
prevent
him
comprehending
the
facts
of
a
world
distinctly
different
from
his
own
it
results
from
this
organic
arrangement
that
marriage
in
any
form
does
not
exist
in
this
world
and
that
the
friendships
between
human
beings
are
never
mixed
with
the
carnal
desires
which
are
inevitably
manifested
on
the
earth
between
people
of
different
sexes
even
when
the
attraction
is
most
pure
probably
you
will
remember
that
during
the
protozoic
period
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
were
all
deaf
dumb
and
sexless
the
division
into
sexes
took
place
much
later
in
the
history
of
nature
both
among
animals
and
plants
being
attracted
towards
this
planet
i
attentively
examined
its
surface
with
my
spiritual
sight
and
i
was
specially
drawn
without
knowing
the
cause
to
a
white
city
resembling
from
afar
a
region
covered
with
snow
but
it
is
improbable
that
it
was
snow
as
it
is
unlikely
that
water
can
exist
on
that
globe
in
the
same
physical
and
chemical
conditions
as
upon
the
earth
upon
the
borders
of
this
city
an
avenue
led
to
a
neighbouring
wood
of
yellow
trees
i
soon
remarked
three
persons
who
seemed
to
be
slowly
sauntering
towards
this
wood
this
little
group
was
formed
of
two
friends
who
were
in
close
conversation
and
of
a
third
who
differed
from
both
by
his
red
garment
and
the
burden
he
bore
and
who
was
probably
their
servant
their
slave
or
some
domestic
animal
whilst
intently
regarding
the
two
principal
personages
i
observed
the
one
to
the
right
raise
his
face
to
the
sky
as
if
some
one
had
called
him
from
a
balloon
and
turn
his
gaze
towards
capella
a
star
which
doubtless
he
did
not
see
because
for
him
it
was
then
daylight
oh
my
old
friend
i
shall
never
forget
the
sudden
surprise
this
sight
gave
me
i
can
still
scarcely
believe
that
i
was
not
dreaming
this
person
on
the
planet
of
virgo
who
was
looking
towards
me
without
knowing
it
was
can
i
tell
you
well
it
was
quærens
how
lumen
yes
my
very
self
i
recognised
myself
instantly
and
you
can
judge
of
my
surprise
quærens
certainly
i
can
i
can
not
comprehend
it
at
all
sidenote
anterior
existence
lumen
the
fact
is
the
situation
was
so
entirely
novel
that
it
demands
explanation
it
was
in
truth
myself
and
i
was
not
long
in
finding
out
not
only
that
it
was
my
former
face
and
figure
but
also
that
the
person
walking
by
my
side
was
my
dear
kathleen
an
intimate
friend
and
the
companion
of
my
studies
upon
that
planet
my
gaze
followed
them
as
far
as
the
yellow
wood
across
picturesque
valleys
beneath
golden
cupolas
under
trees
covered
with
large
branches
and
through
hedges
of
elms
with
leaves
a
purling
brook
babbled
on
the
fine
sand
and
we
seated
ourselves
on
its
banks
i
recall
sweet
hours
we
have
passed
together
the
happy
years
which
have
glided
away
in
this
country
the
fraternal
confidences
and
the
impressions
we
shared
in
the
midst
of
woodland
scenes
of
silent
plains
of
hills
and
of
little
lakes
which
smilingly
reflected
the
heavens
with
aspirations
raised
towards
all
that
was
grand
and
sacred
in
nature
we
adored
god
in
his
works
with
what
joy
i
saw
again
this
phase
of
my
previous
existence
and
riveted
anew
the
golden
chain
whose
links
life
on
earth
had
broken
in
truth
dear
quærens
it
was
my
very
self
who
then
was
living
on
that
planet
of
virgo
i
really
saw
myself
and
i
could
follow
in
sequence
the
events
of
my
life
and
the
happiest
moments
of
that
existence
now
so
far
remote
besides
if
i
had
had
any
doubt
of
my
identity
the
uncertainty
would
have
ceased
during
my
observation
for
whilst
pondering
upon
the
matter
i
saw
berthor
my
brother
during
that
existence
come
out
of
the
wood
approach
us
and
join
in
our
conversation
by
the
side
of
the
murmuring
brook
quærens
master
i
fail
still
to
comprehend
how
you
could
really
see
yourself
on
that
planet
of
virgo
were
you
then
gifted
with
ubiquity
could
you
like
francis
of
assisi
or
apollonius
of
tyana
be
in
two
places
at
the
same
time
sidenote
scientific
explanation
of
anterior
life
on
virgo
lumen
certainly
not
but
in
examining
the
astronomical
of
the
sun
gamma
in
virgo
and
knowing
its
parallax
as
seen
from
capella
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
light
from
this
sun
could
not
employ
less
than
years
in
traversing
the
distance
which
separates
it
from
capella
i
was
then
actually
receiving
the
luminous
ray
which
left
that
world
years
before
and
it
so
happens
that
at
that
epoch
i
was
absolutely
living
upon
the
planet
of
which
we
speak
and
that
i
was
then
in
my
twentieth
year
in
verifying
these
periods
and
in
comparing
the
different
planetary
styles
i
found
in
fact
that
i
was
born
on
the
world
of
virgo
in
the
year
which
corresponds
to
the
year
of
the
christian
era
on
earth
and
that
i
died
through
an
accident
in
the
year
which
corresponds
to
the
year
each
year
of
this
planet
equals
ten
of
yours
when
i
saw
myself
as
i
have
just
told
you
i
appeared
to
be
about
twenty
years
of
age
according
to
earthly
reckoning
but
following
the
way
of
reckoning
on
that
planet
i
was
only
two
years
old
there
the
age
of
fifteen
years
is
often
reached
which
is
considered
the
limit
of
life
on
that
globe
and
is
equivalent
to
years
on
the
earth
sidenote

to
travel

the
luminous

or
to
speak
more
accurately
the

or
photograph
of
the

earthly
years
to
traverse
the
immense
space
which
separates
it
from
capella
consequently
upon
finding
myself
upon
this
last
star
i
was
receiving
at
that
very
moment
the
image
which
left
the
constellation
of
virgo
years
previously
and
although
things
have
changed
greatly
though
generations
have
followed
generations
though
i
died
there
myself
and
have
had
time
to
be
born
again
and
live
years
on
the
earth
nevertheless
light
had
taken
all
this
time
to
cross
the
space
which
separates
virgo
from
capella
and
was
bringing
afresh
to
me
impressions
of
events
long
passed
away
quærens
this
duration
of
the
passage
of
light
being
proved
i
have
not
any
objection
to
urge
on
this
point
but
i
frankly
own
that
to
credit
an
experience
of
such
amazing
singularity
taxes
my
imagination
beyond
its
just
limits
sidenote
the
history
of
each
world
is
contained
in
the
rays
of
light
lumen
this
is
not
any
imagination
my
old
friend
it
is
a
reality
eternal
and
sacred
holding
its
fixed
place
in
the
universal
plan
of
creation
the
light
of
every
star
direct
or
reflected

otherwise

aspect
of
each
sun
and
of
each
planet
is
diffused
in
space
according
to
a
rate
of
rapidity
already
known
to
you
and
the
luminous
ray
contains
in
itself
all
that
is
visible
as
nothing
can
be
lost
the
history
of
each
world
is
contained
in
the
light
which
incessantly
emanates
from
it
in
successive
waves
eternally
travelling
into
infinite
space
without
any
possibility
of
its
being
annihilated
true
the
terrestrial
eye
can
not
read
it
but
there
are
eyes
immeasurably
superior
to
your
earthly
ones

i
make
use
of
the
terms

in
these
conversations
in
order
that
you
may
comprehend
me
but
as
i
told
you
in
a
previous
communication
speaking
absolutely
there
is
not
such
a
thing
as
light
only
vibrations
of
ether
neither
is
there
any
sight
only
perceptions
of
the
mind
moreover
even
upon
the
earth
when
you
examine
the
nature
of
a
star
with
a
telescope
or
better
still
with
a
spectroscope
you
well
know
it
is
not
its
actual
state
you
have
before
your
eyes
but
its
past
state
transmitted
to
you
by
a
ray
of

which
left
it
perhaps
ten
thousand
years
ago
you
know

a
certain

your
astronomers
on

are
seeking
to
determine
the
physical

ceased
even
to
exist
may
indeed
have
ceased
to
exist
since
the
beginning
of
your
world
quærens
we
know
this
is
so
thus
you
have
seen
unrolled
before
your
eyes
your
existence
previous
to
the
last
one
years
after
it
had
flown
by
lumen
say
rather
one
phase
of
this
existence
but
i
could
have
been
able
and
could
now
indeed
review
my
entire
life
by
going
closer
to
that
planet
as
i
have
already
done
for
my
terrestrial
existence
quærens
so
through
the
medium
of
light
you
have
really
seen
again
your
last
two
incarnations
lumen
precisely
and
what
is
more
i
have
seen
them
and
continue
to
see
them
side
by
side
as
it
were
of
one
another
quærens
you
see
them
again
both
at
the
lumen
this
fact
is
easily
explained
the
light
from
the
earth
takes
years
to
reach
capella
the
light
from
the
planet
of
virgo
being
once
and
a
half
farther
off
than
capella
takes
once
and
a
half
longer
time
to
travel
which
would
make
it
about
years
as
i
lived
years
upon
the
earth
and
one
hundred
years
before
that
upon
the
other
planet
these
two
periods
reach
me
at
precisely
same
upon
capella
thus
by
simply
looking
at
these
two
worlds
i
have
before
me
my
last
two
existences
which
unroll
themselves
as
if
i
were
not
here
to
see
them
and
without
my
being
able
to
change
any
of
the
acts
that
i
see
myself
upon
the
point
of
accomplishing
either
upon
the
one
or
the
other
since
those
acts
although
present
and
future
to
my
actual
observation
are
in
reality
past
quærens
this
is
indeed
a
strange
experience
lumen
but
what
struck
me
most
in
this
unexpected
observation
of
two
of
my
previous
existences
in
two
different
worlds
thus
unrolled
before
me
was
the
odd
resemblance
between
these
two
lives
i
found
that
i
had
almost
the
same
tastes
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
the
same
passions
the
same
errors
nothing
criminal
nothing
saintly
in
either
sidenote
explanation
of
inherent
tastes
furthermore
extraordinary
coincidence
i
have
witnessed
scenes
in
the
first
analogous
to
those
i
have
seen
upon
the
earth
this
explains
the
innate
tastes
i
brought
into
the
terrestrial
world
for
the
poetry
of
the
north
the
poems
of
ossian
the
dreamy
landscape
of
ireland
for
its
mountains
and
its
aurora
borealis
for
scotland
scandinavia
sweden
norway
with
its
fiords
spitzbergen
with
its
solitudes
all
alike
attracted
me
old
towers
in
ruins
rocks
and
wild
ravines
sombre
pines
soughing
with
the
northern
winds
all
these
appealed
to
me
on
the
earth
and
seemed
to
have
some
mysterious
link
with
my
deepest
thoughts
when
i
saw
ireland
for
the
first
time
i
felt
as
if
i
had
lived
there
before
when
for
the
first
time
i
ascended
the
rigi
and
the
finsteraarhorn
and
saw
the
superb
sunrise
over
the
snowy
summits
of
the
alps
it
seemed
as
if
i
had
previously
seen
all
this
the
spectre
of
the
brocken
was
not
new
the
reason
being
that
i
had
in
a
former
life
inhabited
similar
regions
on
the
planet
of
virgo
the
same
life
the
same
actions
the
same
circumstances
the

conditions
analogies
analogies
almost
all
that
i
have
seen
done
thought
on
the
earth
i
had
already
seen
done
thought
a
hundred
years
before
upon
that
anterior
world
i
had
always
suspected
it
taking
it
altogether
however
my
terrestrial
life
as
a
whole
was
superior
to
the
one
preceding
it
each
child
in
coming
into
the
world
brings
with
him
different
faculties
special
predispositions
innate
dissimilarities
which
no
one
denies
and
can
only
be
explained
to
the
philosophical
mind
or
in
view
of
eternal
justice
by
the
supposition
of
works
previously
accomplished
by
free
souls
but
though
my
terrestrial
life
was
superior
to
its
anterior
one
evincing
as
it
did
a
more
accurate
and
profound
knowledge
of
the
system
of
the
world
it
yet
lacked
i
am
bound
to
state
the
possession
of
certain
moral
and
physical
qualities
which
belonged
to
me
in
my
former
existence
on
the
other
hand
i
had
faculties
on
that
world
which
i
had
not
had
upon
the
earth
i
may
cite
one
specially
that
of
flying
sidenote
flying
without
wings
i
see
that
on
the
planet
of
virgo
i
could
fly
just
as
easily
as
walk
and
this
without
either
aeronautic
apparatus
or
wings
by
simply
stretching
my
arms
and
legs
as
if
i
were
swimming
in
the
water
on
closely
examining
the
mode
of
locomotion
in
use
on
that
planet
i
see
clearly
that
i
have
or
rather
had
neither
wings
balloon
nor
any
kind
of
mechanical
appliance
at
a
given
moment
i
spring
from
the
ground
by
a
vigorous
leap
and
spreading
out
my
arms
sail
in
the
air
without
fatigue
at
other
times
descending
a
steep
mountain
on
foot
i
spring
out
into
space
with
feet
pressed
together
and
float
at
will
with
a
slow
and
oblique
motion
to
any
point
i
wish
standing
upright
as
soon
as
my
feet
touch
the
ground
sidenote
dreams
bring
reminiscences
of
a
former
existence
then
again
when
i
wish
to
do
so
i
fly
slowly
in
the
manner
of
a
dove
which
describes
a
curve
in
returning
to
its
dovecot
all
this
i
distinctly
see
myself
doing
in
this
world
not
once
but
a
hundred
a
thousand
times
have
i
thus
felt
myself
transported
in
my
dreams
on
earth
softly
naturally
and
without
apparatus
how
can
such
impossibilities
so
often
present
themselves
to
us
in
our
dreams
nothing
can
explain
them
for
nothing
analogous
exists
upon
this
earthly
globe
obeying
instinctively
this
innate
tendency
i
have
frequently
soared
into
the
atmosphere
suspended
from
the
car
of
a
balloon
but
the
sensation
is
not
the
same
does
not
feel
flying
on
the
contrary
one
has
the
feeling
of
being
stationary
i
now
have
the
key
to
my
dreams
during
the
slumber
of
my
terrestrial
senses
my
soul
had
reminiscences
of
its
anterior
existence
quærens
but
i
also
often
feel
and
see
myself
flying
in
dreams
in
precisely
the
way
you
describe
without
wings
or
machinery
and
simply
by
an
effort
of
will
is
this
then
a
proof
that
i
also
have
lived
upon
the
planet
of
virgo
lumen
i
do
not
know
if
you
had
abnormal
sight
or
instruments
or
eyes
sufficiently
piercing
you
could
see
this
planet
from
your
globe
examine
its
surface
and
if
perchance
you
had
existed
there
when
it
parted
with
the
luminous
rays
which
have
actually
reached
the
earth
you
might
perhaps
find
yourself
again
there
but
your
eyes
are
too
feeble
to
make
a
like
research
besides
it
does
not
follow
that
because
you
have
been
able
to
fly
that
therefore
you
have
lived
in
that
world
there
are
a
considerable
number
of
worlds
where
flying
is
the
normal
condition
and
where
all
the
human
race
possess
this
faculty
in
reality
there
are
but
few
planets
where
the
living
creatures
crawl
as
upon
the
earth
sidenote
plurality
of
existences

the
conclusion
resulting
then
from
your
experience
is
that
you
have
had
a
life
anterior
to
that

you
then
believe
in

before
me
both
my
earthly

and
my
anterior

upon
the
planet
of
virgo

i
can
recall
many
other
existences

ah
that
is
precisely
what
i
lack
in

to
possess
a
similar

itself

is
to
say
between
its

then
sees
not

itself

lead
him

will
give
him
the

to
be
coveted

still
admired
upon

is
attached
to
the

in
every
man
reflect
upon
this
at
your
leisure
you
will
arrive
at
the
conviction
that
it
is
absolutely
inexplicable
and
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
belief
in
an
anterior
life
of
the
soul
sidenote
creation
of
the
soul
have
not
most
philosophers
and
theologians
taught
that
the
soul
and
the
body
are
created
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
which
pray
is
the
precise
moment
of
its
creation
is
it
at
the
moment
of
birth
legislation
enlightened
by
anatomical
physiology
knows
that
a
child
lives
before
being
delivered
from
its
uterine
prison
therefore
the
destruction
of
an
embryo
of
eight
months
is
regarded
as
murder
at
what
period
do
you
then
suppose
that
the
soul
appears
in
the
fluid
brain
of
the
foetus
or
of
the
embryo
it
was
thought
in
olden
times
that
the
real
spiritual
quickening
of
the
human
being
took
place
during
the
sixth
week
of
gestation
but
the
modern
belief
is
that
it
occurs
at
the
moment
of
conception
oh
bitter
mockery
in
accordance
with
this
view
you
would
have
the
eternal
designs
of
the
creator
dependent
in
their
execution
upon
capricious
desires
upon
the
intermittent
flames
of
two
amorous
hearts
you
would
dare
to
admit
that
our
immortal
being
is
created
by
the
physical
contact
of
two
human
beings
you
would
be
disposed
to
believe
that
the
divine
head
which
governs
the
worlds
is
influenced
by
intrigue
by
passion
even
by
crime
you
would
think
that
the
number
of
souls
depends
upon
the
number
of
flowers
impregnated
by
the
touch
of
the
sweet
pollen
dust
borne
to
them
on
golden
wings
is
not
such
a
doctrine
such
a
supposition
an
outrage
upon
the
divine
dignity
and
the
spiritual
grandeur
of
the
soul
itself
and
would
it
not
besides
be
the
complete
materialisation
of
our
intellectual
faculties
and
yet
yes
that
seems
so
to
you
because
upon
your
planet
no
soul
can
incarnate
itself
otherwise
than
in
a
human
embryo
it
is
a
law
of
life
on
the
earth
but
you
must
look
through
the
veil
the
soul
is
not
an
effect
the
body
serves
it
only
as
its
garment
quærens
i
admit
that
it
would
indeed
be
singular
that
an
event
of
such
dire
importance
as
the
of
an
immortal
soul
should
spring
from
a
carnal
cause
should
be
the
result
of
casual
unions
more
or
less
legitimate
also
i
agree
with
you
that
organic
causes
do
not
explain
the
different
degrees
of
capacity
with
which
mankind
is
born
into
this
world
but
i
ask
of
what
use
would
be
these
various
existences
if
on
beginning
a
new
life
we
retain
no
remembrance
of
those
that
precede
it
also
if
it
is
really
desirable
to
have
in
prospect
a
journey
without
end
through
endless
worlds
and
an
eternal
transmigration
for
at
last
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
all
and
after
many
æons
of
voyages
we
must
some
day
finish
our
existence

seek
repose

add
that

is

establishes
a
mysterious
bond
unknown
to
themselves
between
living
beings
and
already
in
many
cases
you
have
been
able
to
recognise
its
existence
take
the
case
of
two
beings
as
the
saying
is
it
seems
impossible
for
them
to
live
apart
should
circumstances
lead
to
their
being
separated
our
two
lovers
become
and
their
souls
as
it
were
leave
their
bodies
and
span
any
distance
which
prevents
them
with
one
another
the
thoughts
of
the
one
are
shared
by
the
other
and
they
live
together
despite
their
separation
should
any
misfortune
touch
one
the
other
becomes
immediately
conscious
of
it
and
such
separations
have
been
known
to
end
in
death
how
many
facts
have
been
stated
by
trustworthy
witnesses
of
the
sudden
apparition
of
a
person
to
an
intimate
friend
of
a
wife
to
a
husband
of
a
mother
to
a
son
and
just
at
the
moment
of
death
even
though
many
leagues
might
separate
them
the
most
captious
critic
can
not
in
these
days
deny
facts

circumstantially
proved
twin
children

ten
leagues
apart
and
under
very
different
conditions

stricken
at

the
same
malady
or
if
one
is
excessively
fatigued
the
other
feels
the
same
without
apparently
any
assignable
cause
and
so
on
these
facts
prove
that
ties
of
sympathy
exist
between
souls
and
even
between
bodies
and
give
room
for
the
repeated
reflection
that
we
are
far
from
knowing
all
the
forces
operating
in
nature
if
i
communicate
these
views
to
you
my
friend
it
is
chiefly
to
show
that
you
can
not
only
have
a
foretaste
of
truth
before
death
but
also
that
earthly
existence
is
not
so
entirely
deprived
of
light
as
to
prevent
one
reason

the
chief
characteristics
of

all
these
truths
will
be
emphasised
by

narration

learn
that

this
doctrine
lacks
proofs
logical

and
even
physical
as
numerous
and
as
weighty
as
are
those
in
favour
of
the
plurality
of
the
inhabited

own
that
until
now
i
had
grave
doubts
on
the
subject
modern

marvellous
calculations

enable
us
to
touch

were

other

us
their

and
make
us
acquainted
with
the

on

all
these

have
enabled
contemporaneous
astronomy
to
establish
the
fact
of
human
existence
in
the
other

on
a
strong
and
imperishable
foundation
but
i
repeat
that
it
is
not
so
with
palingenesis
though
i
am
strongly
inclined
towards
the
doctrine
of
the
transmigration
of
souls
in
the
actual

since
this
is
the
only
way
by
which
we
can
gain
an
idea

need
to
be
sustained
by
the

of
a

inspired

it
is
precisely
this

we
have
under
consideration

be
brought
out
by

have
i
own
an
advantage
over
you
since
i
speak

that
i
strictly
limit
myself
to
interpret
with
exactitude
the
events
with
which
my

is
actually
woven

since
you
can
see
the
possibility

of

statement
you
can
not
fail
as
you
listen

increase
your

it
is
for
this
cause
chiefly
that
i
am
always
eager
to
hear

the

of

two

effects
of

nearly
five
hundred
years
ago
i
lived
upon
a
world
whose
astronomical
position
as
seen
from
the
earth
is
precisely
that
of
the
left
breast
of
andromeda
assuredly
the
inhabitants
of
that
world
do
not
suspect
that
the
denizens
of
a
little
planet
in
space
have
joined
the
stars
by
fictitious
lines
tracing
figures
of
men
women
animals
and
divers
objects
incorporating
all
the
stars
in
figures
more
or
less
original
in
order
to
give
them
a
name
it
would
greatly
astonish
some
of
these
planetary
people
if
they
were
told
that
upon
the
earth
certain
stars
bear
the
names
of
what
a
heart
you
are
of
course
aware
that
neither
the
constellations
drawn
upon
the
celestial
globe
nor
the
position
of
the
stars
upon
that
globe
are
either
real
or
absolute
but
are
only
the
result
of
the
position
of
the
earth
in
space
and
thus
are
simply
a
question
of
go
to
the
top
of
a
mountain
and
fix
upon
a
map
the
respective
positions
of
all
the
summits
surrounding
you
in
that
circular
panorama

hills

so
constructed
could
only
serve
for
the
place
from
whence
it
was
drawn

transport
yourself
ten
miles
farther
the
same
summits
are
visible
but
their
respective
positions
in
regard
to
each
other
are
different
resulting
from
the
change
in
perspective
the
panorama
of
the
alps
and
of
the
oberland
as
seen
from
lucerne
and
pilatus
does
not
in
the
least
resemble
that
seen
from
the
fulkhorn
or
from
the
schynige
platte
above
interlaken
yet
these
are
the
same
summits
and
the
same
lakes
it
is
exactly
so
with
the
stars
the
same
aspect
is
seen
both
from
the
star
delta
in
andromeda
and
from
the
earth
but
there
is
not
a
constellation
that
can
be
recognised
because
all
the
celestial
perspectives
have
changed
stars
of
the
first
magnitude
have
become
of
the
second
and
of
the
third
whilst
others
of
lesser
magnitudes
seen
nearer
shine
with
increased
brilliancy
and
above
all
the
respective
situation
of
the
stars
as
regards
one
another
has
completely
changed
in
consequence
of
the
different
position
of
that
star
and
of
the
earth
quærens
therefore
the
appearance
of
the
constellation
which
one
has
so
long
believed
to
be
ineffaceably
traced
upon
the
vaulted
sky
is
only
due
to
perspective
in
changing
our
position
we
change
our
perspective
and
our
sky
is
no
longer
the
same
but
then
ought
we
not
to
have
a
change
of
celestial
perspective
every
six
months
since
during
this
interval
the
earth
has
greatly
altered
its
position
having
removed
to
a
distance
of
millions
of
leagues
from
the
place
it
formerly
occupied
lumen
this
objection
proves
that
you
have
perfectly
comprehended
the
principle
of
the
deformation
of
the
constellations
as
one
moves
in
any
direction
in
space
it
would
be
as
you
suppose
if
the
earth
orbit
were
of
a
dimension
sufficiently
vast
for
the
two
opposite
points
of
this
orbit
to
change
the
view
of
this
celestial
scenery
quærens
millions
of
leagues
lumen
are
as
nothing
in
the
order
of
celestial
distances
and
can
no
more
affect
the
perspectives
of
the
stars
than
taking
a
step
in
the
cupola
of
the
pantheon
would
change

therefore

are
simply

the
old

no

shows
that

truths

not
oppose
one
another

is
a
necessity
that
the
spiritual
heaven
should
accord
with
the
physical

the
object
of
my
various
conversations
is
the
demonstration
of
this
truth

the
world
of

which
i
speak

is
nothing
resembling

that

that

is
very
different
from
ours

a
superior
kind

it
is
endowed
with
five
senses
similar

is
a

quærens
you
speak
master
as
if
you
thought
it
were
possible
to
live
without
eating
lumen
do
you
then
believe
that
the
beings
of
every
world
in
space
are
subject
to
an
operation
so
ridiculous
as
this
happily
in
many
of
the
worlds
the
spirit
is
not
subjected
to
such
ignominy
sidenote
atmospheric
nutrition
it
is
not
so
difficult
as
you
may
suppose
on
first
thoughts
to
believe
in
the
possibility
of
atmospheric
nutriment
the
maintenance
of
life
among
man
and
the
animals
depends
upon
two
causes
respiration
and
nutrition
the
first
is
found
naturally
in
the
atmosphere
the
second
is
derived
from
nourishment
nutrition
produces
blood
from
the
blood
come
the
tissues
the
muscles
the
bones
the
cartilages
the
flesh
the
brain
the
nerves
in
a
word
the
organic
constituents
of
the
body
the
oxygen
we
breathe
can
itself
be
considered
as
a
nutritive
substance
inasmuch
as
it
combines
with
the
principal
aliments
absorbed
by
the
stomach
and
completes
the
formation
of
the
blood
and
the
development
of
the
tissues
sidenote
the
process
of
alimentation
now
to
imagine
nutrition
passing
entirely
into
the
domain
of
the
atmosphere
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
that
as
a
whole
a
complete
aliment
is
made
up
of
albumen
of
sugar
of
fat
and
of
salt
and
to
imagine
also
that
an
atmospheric
fluid
in
place
of
being
composed
of
azote
and
of
oxygen
only
should
be
formed
of
these
different
substances
in
a
gaseous
state
these
aliments
are
found
in
the
solids
that
you
absorb
digestion
is
the
function
which
separates
them
and
which
causes
them
to
assimilate
with
the
organs
to
which
they
belong
when
for
example
you
eat
a
morsel
of
bread
you
introduce
into
your
stomach
a
grain
of
starch
a
substance
insoluble
in
water
and
which
is
not
found
in
the
blood
the
saliva
and
the
pancreatic
juice
transform
the
insoluble
starch
into
soluble
sugar
the
bile
the
pancreatic
juice
and
the
intestinal
secretions
change
the
sugar
into
fat
both
sugar
and
fat
are
present
in
the
blood
and
it
is
by
the
processes
of
alimentation
that
substances
are
separated
and
assimilated
in
your
body
it
astonishes
you
my
friend
that
after
living
five
years
according
to
terrestrial
reckoning
in
the
celestial
world
i
can
remember
all
these
material
terms
and
condescend
to
make
use
of
them
but
the
memories
that
i
have
brought
from
the
earth
are
still
vivid
and
as
we
speak
on
this
occasion
on
a
question
of
organic
physiology
i
do
not
feel
ashamed
of
calling
things
by
their
own
names
if
then
we
suppose
that
in
place
of
being
combined
or
mixed
in
the
constitution
of
bodies
solid
or
liquid
these
aliments
could
be
found
in
a
gaseous
state
in
the
composition
of
the
atmosphere
we
should
create
by
this
means
nutritive
atmospheres
which
would
dispense
with
digestion
and
its
attendant
coarse
and
humiliating
functions
that
which
man
is
capable
of
imagining
in
the
restricted
sphere
of
his
observation
nature
has
put
in
practice
in
more
than
one
spot
of
the
universe
besides
i
can
assure
you
that
when
one
has
ceased
to
be
accustomed
to
this
material
process
of
the
introduction
of
nourishment
into
the
digestive
tube
one
can
not
avoid
being
impressed
with
its
coarseness
this
was
the
reflection
i
made
a
few
days
ago
whilst
observing
one
of
the
richest
countries
on
your
planet
i
was
struck
by
the
suave
and
angelic
beauty
of
a
maiden
reclining
in
a
gondola
as
it
floated
gently
on
the
blue
waters
of
the
bosphorus
before
constantinople
red
velvet
cushions
embroidered
with
brilliant
silks
whose
heavy
tassels
of
gold
touched
the
water
formed
the
divan
of
this
young
circassian
before
her
knelt
a
little
black
slave
playing
upon
some
stringed
instrument
her
form
was
so
juvenile
and
graceful
her
bended
arm
so
elegant
her
eyes
so
pure
and
innocent
her
pensive
brow
so
calm
under
the
light
of
heaven
that
for
an
instant
i
was
captivated
by
a
kind
of
retrospective
admiration
for
this
masterpiece
of
living
nature
well
while
this
pure
vision
of
awakening
youth
sweet
as
a
flower
opening
its
petals
to
the
sun
rays
held
me
in
a
kind
of
passing
enchantment
the
bark
reached
the
and
the
maiden
leaning
on
a
slave
seated
herself
on
a
couch
near
a
table
around
which
others
had
already
gathered
she
began
to
eat
yes
for
near
an
hour
was
i
could
scarcely
tolerate
the
earthly
recollections
recalled
by
this
ridiculous
spectacle
to
see
a
being
like
that
partaking
of
food
through
the
mouth
and
making
her
charming
body
the
receptacle
for
i
do
not
know
what
substances
what
vulgarity

morsels
of
some
kind
of
animal
which
her
pearly
teeth
did
not
disdain
to
chew
and
again
fragments
of
another
animal
which
her
virginal
lips
opened
without
hesitation
to
receive
and
swallow

a

medley
of
ingredients
drawn
from
cattle
or
from

which
have
lived
in

mire
and
afterwards
been
slaughtered

i
turned
away
with
sadness
from
this
strange
contrast

directed
my
gaze
to
the

of
saturn

humanity
need
not
stoop
to
such
necessities

without

they
are
condemned
to
use
their
lungs
in
order
to
prepare
the
nutritious
air
they
need
without
sleeping
and
without
ever
feeling
satisfied
because
despite
their
incessant
toil
they
can
not
absorb
more
than
a
small
quantity
at
a

thus
they
pass
their
entire

apply

an
idea

i
will
cite
two
examples
selecting
the
subjects
of
religion
and

as
these
are
generally
the
best
criterions
of
the
value
of
a
people
in

in
place
of
seeking
for
god
in

and
of
basing
their
judgment
on
science
instead
of
aspiring
to
the
truth
and
of
using
their
eyes
to
see
and
their
reason
to
comprehend
in
a
word
in
place
of
establishing
the
foundations
of
their
philosophy
upon
knowledge
as
exact
as
possible
of
the
order
which
governs
the
world
they
are
divided
into
sects
who
are
voluntarily
blind
and
believe
they
render
homage
to
their
pretended
god
by
ceasing
to
reason
and
think
they
adore
him
in
maintaining
that
their
anthill
is
unique
in
space
by
reciting
phrases
and
in
injuring
other
sects
and
alas
by
blessing
swords
and
burnings
at
the
stake
and
in
authorising
massacres
and
wars
their
doctrines
contain
assertions
which
seem
expressly
imagined
to
outrage

are
precisely
those
which

the
articles

their

a
form

can
not

the

had
never
quitted
its
rock
if
these
primitive
elements
of

life
had
remained
stationary
at
the
point
of
their
formation
and
if
for
any
cause
whatever
the
faculty
of
locomotion
had
never
had
a
beginning
the
consequence
would
have
been
that
in

of
the
system
of
terrestrial
vitality
being
manifested
in
two
different
directions
in
the
world
of
plants
and
the
world
of
animals
it
would
have
continued
manifesting
itself
solely
in
the
first
direction
with
the
result
that
there
would
have
been
but
one
kingdom
instead
of
two
and
the
creative
progress
would
have
operated
in
that
kingdom
as
it
operated
in
the
animal
kingdom
it
would
not
have
been
arrested
at
the
formation
of
sensitives
superior
plants
which
are
already
gifted
with
a
veritable
nervous
system
nor
would
it
have
stopped
at
the
formation
of
flowers
which
are
already
bordering
on
ours
in
their
organic
functions
but
continuing
its
ascension
would
have
produced
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
that
which
has
already
been
produced
in
the
animal
kingdom
as
it
is
many
vegetables
feel
and
act
here
would
have
been

feeling
and
making
themselves
understood

not

only
mankind

of
being

as
it
is
would
have
been
fixed
by

is
the
state
of
the
annular
world
in
which
i
lived
fifteen
centuries
ago
in
the
heart
of
the
milky
way
quærens
of
a
truth
this
world
of
astonishes
me
more
than
the
previous
one
and
i
find
it
difficult
to
picture
to
myself
the
life
and
manners
of
these
singular
beings
sidenote
lumen
their
kind
of
life
is
indeed
very
different
from
yours
they
neither
build
cities
nor
make
voyages
they
have
no
need
of
any
form
of
government
they
are
ignorant
of
war
that
scourge
of
terrestrial
humanity
and
they
have
nothing
of
that
national
called
patriotism
which
is
one
of
your
characteristics
prudent
patient
and
gifted
with
constancy
they
have
neither
the
mobility
nor
the
fragility
of
the
denizens
of
the
earth
life
there
reaches
an
average
of
five
or
six
centuries
and
is
calm
sweet
uniform
and
without
revolutions
but
do
not
think
that
these
live
only
a
vegetable
life
on
the
contrary
they
have
an
existence
both
personal
and
positive
they
are
divided
not
by
caste
regulated
by
birth
and
fortune
according
to
that
absurd
custom
on
the
earth
but
by
families
whose
native
value
differs
precisely
according
to
its
kind
they
have
an
unwritten
social
history
but
nothing
which
happens
amongst
them
can
be
lost
inasmuch
as
they
have
neither
emigrations
nor
conquests
but
their
records
and
traditions
are
handed
down
from
one
generation
to
another
each
one
knows
the
history
of
his
own
race
they
have
also
two
sexes
as
upon
the
earth
and
unions
take
place
there
in
a
similar
manner
but
are
purer
more
disinterested
and
invariably
affectionate
nor
are
these
unions
always
consanguineous
impregnation
can
even
be
effected
at
a
distance
quærens
but
after
all
how
can
they
communicate
their
thoughts
if
it
be
true
that
they
think
and
besides
master
how
was
it
possible
for
you
to
recognise
yourself
on
this
singular
world
sidenote
manner
of
life
upon
cygnus
lumen
the
same
reply
will
satisfactorily
answer
your
double
question
i
was
looking
at
that
ring
in
the
constellation
of
cygnus
being
drawn
there
with
persistence
by
some
irresistible
instinct
it
surprised
me
to
see
only
vegetable
growths
upon
its
surface
and
i
principally
remarked
their
singular
manner
of
grouping
here
two
and
two
there
three
and
three
farther
off
ten
and
ten
besides
others
in
larger
clusters
some
were
seated
as
it
were
upon
the
brink
of
a
fountain
others
appeared
to
be
reposing
with
little
shoots
springing
up
round
them
i
sought
to
find
there
the
kinds
familiar
to
me
on
the
earth
such
as
pines
oaks
poplars
willows
but
i
could
not
find
any
of
these
botanical
growths
at
last
i
fixed
my
eyes
upon
a
plant
in
the
shape
of
a
without
either
leaves
or
fruit
but
full
of
brilliant
scarlet
flowers
when
suddenly
i
saw
this
enormous
stretch
out
a
bough
like
a
gigantic
arm
raise
the
extremity
of
this
arm
to
its
head
and
pluck
one
of
the
magnificent
flowers
ornamenting
its
crown
and
then
present
the
same
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
to
another
growing
some
little
distance
apart
of
slender
and
graceful
form
and
bearing
sweet
blue
flowers
this
one
appeared
to
receive
the
red
flower
with
a
certain
pleasure
for
it
extended
a
branch
or
one
might
say
a
cordial
hand
to
its
neighbour
which
was
apparently
held
in
a
long
clasp
under
certain
circumstances
as
you
know
a
gesture
is
sufficient
for
making
yourself
known
to
another
thus
then
the
meaning
of
this
tableau
was
borne
in
upon
me
this
gesture
of
the
in
the
milky
way
awoke
within
me
a
world
of
memories

as
i
was
fifteen
centuries
ago
and
in
the
with
the
violet
flowers
which
were
grouped
around
me
i
recognised
my
children
for
i
recollected
that
the
tints
of
the
flowers
borne
by
the
offspring
are
the
result
of
the
admixture
of
the
two
colours
distinguishing
their
parents
sidenote
faculties
of
these
see
without
eyes
hear
without
ears
and
speak
without
larynx

you
not

can
discriminate
not
only
night
from
day

also

in

only
hear
each

also

rudiments
are
developed
to
a
veritable
degree
of
civilisation

are
as
complete
in

intelligence
it
is
true
is
less
advanced
than
the
average
intellect
of
terrestrial
humanity

in
their
manners

relations
they
show
in
all
ways
a
sweetness

refinement

might
often
serve
as
a
model

you
will
cease
to
be

you
will

reflect
that
light

two
modes

can
even
say

the
result

when
you
spoke
to
me

an

will
construct

the
most
singular

that
which
illustrates
the
principle

i
have
spoken
to
you

day

visited

found
myself
in

beheld
a

consisted
in
fact
of
a
cylindrical
stalk

uppermost

separated
into
many
branches

those
of
a

central

as

as
those
of
the
branches
measured
about
a
third
of
a
metre
in
diameter
the
tops
of
the
stalk
and
of
the
branches
were
crowned
with
a
diadem
of
silver
fringe
suddenly
i
saw
this
being
agitate
his
branches
and
then
vanish

fact
is
that
in
this

individuals
although
quite

fall
to
pieces

are

separate

disintegrate

the

fly
apart

just
so
i
can
recollect
this
disintegration
of
the

took
place
in
their
lives
sometimes
it
was
the
result
of
contrariety
sometimes
of
fatigue

in
other

of
a
want

suddenly
they
are
reduced

itself
descending

and
of
your

are
in
a
like
case
they
are
provinces
but
subject
to
a
superior
authority
the
working
of
this
superior
authority
is
a
condition
of
human
life
a
condition
which
is
less
exclusive
amongst
the
inferior
animals
each
ring
of
the
worm
called
lombric
is
a
complete
worm
so
that
a
lombric
represents
a
series
of
similar
beings
constituting
a
veritable
living
cooperative
society
cut
into
rings
the
worm
would
be
so
many
independent
individuals
in
the
a
solitary
worm
the
head
is
of
more
importance
than
the
rest
of
the

and
possesses
the
faculty
of
reproducing
the
rest
of
the

after
it
has
been
cut
off
the
leech
is
another
example
of
united
individuals
cut
it
into
five
or
six
rings
and
the
operation
gives
you
as
many
leeches
thus
also
a
cutting
of
a

of
a

will
grow
in
like
manner
a

a
lizard

the

direction
you
are
composed
of
a
multitude
of

grouped
together
and
dominated
by
the
plastic
attraction
of
your
personal
soul
which
from
the
centre
of
your
being
has
formed
your
body
from
the

and
has
united
round
itself
in
a
microcosm
a

nature
itself
is
then
in
a
state
of
absolute
republicanism

republicanism
governed
by

but
when
a
being
finds
itself
thus
disintegrated
how
can
he
afterwards
reconstitute
himself
as
a
whole

by
an
act
of
the

and
often
without
the

effort
and
even
by
a

are
still
intimately

can
easily
picture
to

the
spectacle
of
this
lilliputian
army

summoned
by
a
whistle
drawing
to
its

to
organise
a
reunion
all
the
little
soldiers
climbing
one
over
the

in
a

taking
their

to
reconstruct
the
that
you
have
described
to

one
really
ought
to
leave
the

behold
such
rare
wonders

you
still
judge
of
universal

by
the
atom
that
you
have
before
your
eyes
and
you
are
only
qualified
to
comprehend
the
facts
which
are
within
the
sphere
of
your
observations
but
i
assure
you
the

is
not
the
type
of
the
universe
sidenote
various
forms
of

this
world
of
θ
orionis
with
its
seven
revolving
suns
is
peopled
by
an
organic
system
analogous
to
that
which
i
have
just
described
to
you
i
lived
there
years
ago
and
i
can
see
myself
there
again
in
accordance
with
the
time
that
light
occupied
in
coming
from
that
point
in
space
to
capella
when
there
i
was
acquainted
with
the
spirit
who
in
this
century
was
incarnated
on
the
earth
and
published
his
studies
under
the
name
of
allan
kardec
we
did
not
recollect
that
we
had
known
one
another
before
during
our
terrestrial
life
but
we
often
felt
attracted
to
one
another
by
peculiar
intellectual
sympathies
now
that
he
has
returned
like
myself
into
the
world
of
spirits
he
also
remembers
the
singular
republic
of
orion
and
can
see
it
yes
this
is
very
curious
but
it
is
quite
true
you
have
no
idea
on
your
poor
planet
of
the
unimaginable
diversity
which
separates
the
worlds
in
their
geological
as
much
as
in
their
physiological
organisations
sidenote
sense
of
sight
in

these
conversations
may
serve
to
throw
light
on
your
knowledge
of
this
general
truth
so
important
in
the
conception
of
the
universe
but
the
scientific
service
that
these
conversations
can
specially
render
you
is
in
making
you
understand
that
light
is
the
mode
of
transmission
of
universal
history
with
the
powerful
visual
faculty
which
we
enjoy
here
we
can
distinguish
the
surface
of
distant
worlds
the
eye
of
our
perisprit
is
not
identical
with
the
bodily
eye
in
the
terrestrial
sight
the
rays
diverge
so
that
a
very
small
object
placed
quite
near
the
eye
fills
the
interval
of
the
two
rays
whilst
at
a
greater
distance
a
larger
object
is
necessary
to
fill
the
space
proportionately
increased
which
separates
the
same
rays
in
our
eye
on
the
contrary
the
visual
rays
enter
in
parallel
lines
so
that
we
see
each
object
in
its
real
proportions
and
in
its
normal
size
its
apparent
size
being
quite
unaffected
by
distance
we
do
not
see
the
whole
of
large
objects
but
only
sections
of
them
proportioned
to
the
openings
of
our
special
retina
but
these
parts
are
seen
by
us
with
equal
clearness
at
any
distance
when
there
is
no
atmosphere
to
veil
this
distance
a
tree
in
a
prairie
on
a
celestial
body
as
far
as
theta
of
orion
is
from
capella
is
perfectly
visible
to
us
on
the
other
hand
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
successive
transmission
of
the
rays
of
light
all
the
events
in
nature
and
the
history
of
all
the
worlds
are
depicted
in
space
as
a
universal
tableau
the
most
true
and
the
most
magnificent
in
all
nature
sidenote
infinite
diversity
in
sirius
as
these
conversations
will
have
shown
you
i
have
traversed
a
great
many
different
celestial
countries
and
have
actually
studied
creation
without
fixing
myself
in
any
place
i
hope
in
the
course
of
the
next
century
to
be
reincarnated
on
a
world
dependent
on
the
train
of
sinus
the
humanity
there
is
more
beautiful
than
that
of
the
earth
birth
is
effected
by
means
of
an
organic
system
less
ridiculous
and
less
brutal
than
that
of
the
earth
but
the
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
the
life
on
this
world
is
that
there
men
perceive
the
operations
which
take
place
for
the
maintenance
of
the
body
from
each
molecule
of
the
body
so
to
speak
proceeds
a
nerve
which
transmits
to
the
brain
the
various
impressions
that
it
receives
so
that
the
soul
absolutely
knows
its
body
and
rules
over
it
as
a
sovereign
sidenote

in
aldebaran
there
is
an
immense
variety
amongst
the
worlds
on
one
of
the
planets
of
the

of
aldebaran
very
curious
from
this
point
of
view
the
vegetables
are
all
composed
of
a
substance
analogous
to
because
silica
and
magnesia
predominate
in
its
constitution
the

feed
on
this

only
most
of
the

inhabiting
this

are
upon
the

i
speak

is
illumined
by
phosphorescent

i
have
visited
other
worlds
where
night
does
not
exist
at
all
where
day
and
night
do
not
succeed
each
other
as
upon
the
earth
because
every
portion
of
their
spheres
is
continuously
supplied
with
light
by
several
suns
which
never
leave
them
in
darkness
for
an
instant
there
sleep
is
unnecessary
either
for
man
for
animals
or
for

upon
your
planet
sleep
consumes
a
third
portion
of
your
life
its
primary
cause
being
the
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
which
produces
day
and
night
in
succession
on
the
various
parts
of
the
globe
upon
these
worlds
where
it
is
always
day
the
inhabitants
never
sleep
and
it
would
greatly
surprise
them
to
learn
that
there
exists
a
humanity
where
a
third
of
life
is
passed
in
a
lethargy
resembling
death
sidenote
phosphoric

not
far
from
this
a
world
revolves
where
night
is
almost
unknown
although
it
does
not
possess
a
nocturnal
sun
as
in
the
quadrilateral
of
orion
and
it
has
no
satellites
the
rocks
of
its
mountains
being
of
a
chemical
composition
that
reminds
one
of
the
phosphates
and
the
sulphates
of
barytes
store
up
the
solar
light
received
during
the
day
and
during
the
night
they
radiate
a
sweet
calm
translucent
light
which
illumines
the
scenery
with
a
tranquil
nocturnal
clearness
there
also
one
sees
curious
trees
bearing
flowers
which
shine
in
the
evening
like
these
resemble
but
the
snowy
flowers
are
luminous
phosphorus
enters
largely
into
the
composition
of
this
curious
and
singular
world
its
atmosphere
is
constantly
electrical
its
animals
are
luminous
as
well
as
its

and
its
humanity
partakes
of
the
same
nature
sidenote
the
passions
phosphorescent
the
temperature
is
very
high
and
the
inhabitants
have
not
much
need
to
invent
clothes
now
it
happens
that
certain
passions
are
manifested
by
the
illumination
of
part
of
the
body
this
is
on
a
large
scale
what
takes
place
on
a
small
scale
in
your
terrestrial
meadows
where
one
sees
in
the
sweet
summer
evenings
the
silently
consumed
in
an
amorous
flame
in
the
of
the
north
that
you
see
in
france
the
male
is
winged
and
is
not
luminous
the
female
on
the
contrary
is
luminous
but
does
not
possess
the
aerial
faculty
in
italy
the
two
sexes
are
winged
and
both
can
become
luminous
the
humanity
which
i
am
describing
to
you
has
all
the
advantages
of
this
latter
type
certain
forms
of
terrestrial
life
are
to
be
met
with
among
the
sidereal
humanities
thus
we
find
in
some
of
them
the
same
thing
that
takes
place
on
the
earth
in
the
ant
world
where
on
the
day
of
their
aerial
unions
all
the
males
die
of
exhaustion
and
again
in
the
world
of
bees
where
the
procreators
are
pitilessly
sacrificed
and
amongst
spiders
where
they
are
devoured
by
their
companions
unless
they
can
immediately
escape
we
find
reproduced
the
habits
of
a
great
number
of
insects
which
never
see
their
offspring
and
lay
their
eggs
in
surroundings
in
which
the
will
find
their
first
food
the
human
body
on
this
earth
owes
its
form
and
its
state
of
being
to
the
atmospheric
environment
and
to
the
conditions
of
density
of
weight
and
of
nutrition
by
means
of
which
terrestrial
evolution
operates
the
human
being
proceeds
from
the
fusion
of
a
microscopic
masculine
corpuscle
with
a
minute
feminine
ovule
this
fusion
gives
birth
to
a
little
cell
which
is
transformed
into
the
embryo
in
which
gradually
appear
the
heart
the
head
the
limbs
and
the
different
organs
the
nervous
system
of
this
embryo
may
be
compared
to
rays
of
delicate
threads
proceeding
from
a
central
point
which
will
become
the
brain
under
the
influence
of
the
solar
light
and
of
the
vibrations
of
the
air
one
of
these
nerves
is
developed
at
its
extremity
and
forms
the
eye
this
is
undefined
at
first
and
almost
blind
in
an
elementary
state
like
the
eyes
of
the
trilobites
and
of
the
fishes
of
the
silurian
period
but
it
develops
into
the
admirable
eyes
of
birds
of
the
vertebræ
and
of
man
the
senses
of
smell
and
taste
proceed
from
the
nerves
in
the
same
way
these
last
two
senses
with
that
of
touch
are
the
most
primitive
the
earliest
and
the
most
necessary
to
life
there
are
but
two
of
the
senses
which
place
man
in
communication
with
the
outer
world
sight
and
hearing
but
the
eye
is
the
sole
organ
which
puts
us
in
communication
with
the
whole
universe
millions
of
these
little
proceed
from
the
brain
through
the
body
without
producing
any
other
than
the
five
senses
unless
we
except
certain
sensations
of
touch
which
are
intimate
and
personal
and
which
have
even
been
described
as
a
sixth
sense
you
shall
hear
now
there
is
no
reason
why
that
which
has
taken
place
and
been
arrested
on
our
little
planet
should
take
place
and
be
arrested
in
the
same
fashion
elsewhere
in
proof
of
this
i
must
tell
you
that
i
visited
not
long
since
two
worlds
on
which
human
beings
have
two
senses
of
which
we
have
not
any
idea
on
our
earth
one
of
these
senses
may
be
described
as
electrical
one
of
the
little
of
which
i
have
just
told
you
is
developed
into
a
multitude
of
ramifications
which
form
a
sort
of
cornet
these
under
the
scalpel
and
the
microscope
appear
to
be
tubes
placed
in
juxtaposition
the
outer
extremity
of
which
receives
the
electric
fluid
and
transmits
it
to
the
brain
much
as
our
optic
nerves
receive
the
waves
of
light
and
our
auditory
nerves
receive
the
undulations
of
sound
the
beings
provided
with
this
sense
perceive
the
electrical
condition
of
bodies
of
material
things
of
plants
and
flowers
of
animals
of
the
atmosphere
and
of
clouds
to
these
beings
this
electric
sense
is
a
source
of
knowledge
which
is
wholly
forbidden
to
us
their
organic
sensations
are
all
different
from
yours
their
eyes
are
not
constructed
like
yours
they
do
not
see
what
you
see
they
see
what
you
do
not
see
they
are
conscious
only
of
the
invisible
violet
rays
but
their
mode
of
existence
differs
from
yours
especially
through
their
electric
sense
the
electric
constitution
of
their
world
is
the
cause
of
the
existence
and
of
the
development
of
this
sense
another
sense
with
which
i
was
still
more
struck
and
which
was
of
quite
a
different
character
i
found
on
a
second
world
this
was
the
sense
of
orientation
another
of
the
proceeding
from
the
brain
produced
a
species
of
winged
ear
very
light
by
means
of
which
the
living
being
perceives
his
direct
bearings
he
is
conscious
of
the
points
of
the
compass
and
turns
to
the
north
or
the
south
the
east
or
the
west
instinctively
the
atmosphere
is
full
of
emanations
which
you
never
perceive
this
singular
sense
orients
the
possessors
of
it
infallibly
it
enables
them
also
to
discover
things
concealed
in
the
interior
of
the
sun
and
gives
them
an
insight
into
some
of
nature
secrets
which
are
absolutely
hidden
from
you
i
would
thus
demonstrate
to
you
that
in
the
vast
domains
of
creation
an
infinite
variety
exists
and
that
eternity
will
be
inexhaustibly
occupied
in
gathering
and
partaking
of
its
flowers
and
of
its
fruits
there
are
worlds
where
old
age
is
unknown
where
lovers
are
consumed
in
a
delirious
fantasy
transported
by
the
intoxication
of
the
body
and
careless
of
the
morrow
the
active
sex
never
survive
these
nuptials

passive
sex
oviparous

secured
the
perpetuity
of
the

celestial

never
grows

not
without
their

the

and
the

are
all

although
the

of
the
human
inhabitants
is
highly
developed
and
thought
has
a
prodigious
activity
life
there
appears
to
be
of
an
endless
length
those
who
die
of
old
age
have
lived
more
than
a
thousand
of
these
years
but
they
are
so
rare
that
the
memory
of
a
few
only
have
been
preserved
in
the
historical
records
of
this

war
between
the
nations
has
never
been

because
there
is

race
one

the
natural

of
these

are
remarkable
diseases
are
almost
unknown
there
are
no
doctors
as
a
result
of
this
great
mental
activity
the
length
of
life
becomes
a
perspective
without
end
and
before
long
becomes
a
burden
hence
suicide
is
almost
universal
this
custom
has
been
habitual
from
very
ancient
times
the
few
old
men
who
from
any
special
motive
have
not
put
an
end
to
their
lives
are
looked
upon
as
exceptional
beings
originals
and
more
or
less
eccentric
suicide
is
the
general
law
but
my
dear
friend
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
to
you
all
the
curiosities
of

let
it
suffice
that
i
have
raised
the

sufficiently
to
give
you
a

exists
in
the

while
accompanying
me
in

in
this
interstellar
voyage
you
have
passed
several
hours
away
from
the
earth
it
is
well
to
isolate
one
self
thus
at
times
amongst
the
celestial
solitudes
the
soul
obtains
a
fuller
possession
of
itself
and
in
its
solitary
reflections
it
penetrates
profoundly
into
the
universal

terrestrial
humanity
you
understand

if
life
is
divided
with
you
between
work
and
rest
between
activity
and
sleep
it
is
because
of
the
rotation
of
the
globe
and

the
luminous
globes
and
those
lighted
by
many
suns
alternately
they
do
not
sleep
if
you
need
to
eat
and
drink
it
is
in
consequence
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
atmosphere
the
bodies
of
the
beings
who
do
not
eat
are
not
constructed
like
yours
since
they
have
no

there
are

than
those
which
you
perceive
in

each
of
the
worlds
is
inhabited
by
a

essentially

the

is
to
form
a

of

and

what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
not

of
the
physical
differences
of
humanity
but
also
of
its
moral
and
intellectual
diversities
its
varieties
are
great
too
much
so
indeed
for
you
to
thoroughly
understand
them
as
an
instance
i
will
give
you
just
one
noteworthy
example
in
your
terrestrial
humanity
intellectual
or
moral
worth
counts
for
nothing
in
advancing
a
man
whatever
may
be
the
value
of
his
ideas
or
the
worth
of
his
personal
character
unless
he
possesses
the
means
and
the
determination
to
push
himself
forward
no
one
seeks
for
hidden
merit
a
man
must
needs
make
his
own
way
and
struggle
against
intrigue
cupidity
and
ambition
a
strife
which
is
the
antipodes
of
what
ought
to
be
it
results
therefore
that
the
noblest
and
most
worthy
people
remain
in
obscurity
whilst
position
wealth
and
social
distinction
are
often
showered
on
worthless
intriguers
ah
well
i
recently
visited
a
world
belonging
to
one
of
the
most
luminous
regions
of
the
milky
way
where
an
intellectual
order
absolutely
different
exists
where
the
constitution
of
the
government
is
such
that
only
those
distinguished
for
their
virtues
are
placed
at
the
head
of
the
state
and
their
function
is
to
seek
out
and
place
in
responsible
positions
men
worthy
of
the
trust
in
that
country
in
short
the
search
is
as
eager
for
the
discovery
of
merit
and
intelligence
as
it
is
in
yours
for
gold
and
diamonds
all
is
done
there
for
the
benefit
of
humanity
they
have
not
invented
any
academy
as
they
can
not
conceive
that
a
man
of
worth
instead
of
being
sought
after
should
be
compelled
to
waste
his
time
in
visits
of
ceremony
and
find
probably
that
a
titled
nobody
who
has
known
better
than
he
how
to
cajole
votes
has
been
preferred
to
himself
so
true
it
is
that
the
system
prevailing
in
other
worlds
is
far
more
enlightened
than
that
of
yours
sidenote
the
magnifying
power
of
time
now
my
dear
terrestrial
friend
you
know
what
the
earth
is
in
the
universe
you
know
something
of
what
the
heavens
contain
and
you
know
also
what
life
is
and
what
death
is
we
shall
soon
see
the
dawn
of
morning
which
puts
spirits
to
flight
and
brings
our
conversations
to
an
end
as
the
approach
of
your
terrestrial
day
causes
the
brightness
of
venus
to
fade
away
but
i
should
like
to
add
to
the
preceding
ideas
a
very
interesting
remark
suggested
by
the
same
observations
it
is
this
if
you
set
out
from
the
earth
at
the
moment
that
a
flash
of
lightning
bursts
forth
and
if
you
travelled
for
an
hour
or
more
with
the
light
you
would
see
the
lightning
as
long
as
you
continued
to
look
at
it
this
fact
is
established
by
the
foregoing
principles
but
if
instead
of
travelling
with
the
velocity
of
light
you
were
to
travel
with
a
little
less
velocity
note
the
observation
that
you
might
make
i
will
suppose
that
this
voyage
away
from
the
earth
during
which
you
look
at
the
lightning
lasts
a
minute
i
will
suppose
also
that
the
lightning
lasts
a
thousandth
part
of
a
second
you
will
continue
to
see
the
lightning
during
times
its
duration
in
our
first
supposition
this
voyage
is
identical
with
that
of
light
light
has
occupied
tenths
of
seconds
to
go
from
the
earth
to
the
point
in
space
where
you
are
your
voyage
and
that
of
light
have
now
if
instead
of
flying
with
just
the
same
velocity
as
light
you
had
flown
a
little
less
quickly
and
if
you
had
employed
a
thousandth
part
of
a
second
more
to
arrive
at
the
same
point
instead
of
always
seeing
same
moment
of
the
you
would
have
seen
successively
the
different
moments
which
constituted
the
total
duration
of
the
lightning
equal
to
parts
of
a
second
in
this
whole
minute
you
would
have
had
time
to
see
first
the
beginning
of
the
flash
of
lightning
and
could
analyse
the
development
of
it
the
successive
phases
of
it
to
the
very
end
you
may
imagine
what
strange
discoveries
one
could
make
in
the
secret
nature
of
lightning
increased
times
in
the
order
of
its
duration
what
frightful
battles
you
would
have
time
to
discover
in
the
flames
what
pandemonium
what
unlucky
atoms
what
a
world
hidden
by
its
volatile
nature
from
the
imperfect
eyes
of
mortals
sidenote
vision
of
the
analysing
eye
if
you
could
see
by
your
imagination
sufficiently
to
separate
and
count
the
atoms
which
constitute
the
body
of
a
man
that
body
would
disappear
before
you
for
it
consists
of
thousands
of
millions
of
atoms
in
motion
and
to
the
analysing
eye
it
would
be
a
nebula
animated
by
the
forces
of
gravitation
did
not
swedenborg
imagine
that
the
universe
by
which
he
was
surrounded
seen
as
a
whole
was
in
the
form
of
an
immense
man
that
was
anthropomorphism
but
there
are
analogies
everywhere
what
we
know
most
certainly
is
that
things
what
they
appear
to
be
either
in
space
or
in
time
but
let
us
return
to
the
delayed
flash
of
lightning
when
you
travel
with
the
velocity
of
light
you
see
constantly
the
scene
which
was
in
existence
at
the
moment
of
your
departure
if
you
were
carried
away
for
a
year
at
the
same
rate
you
would
have
before
your
eyes
the
same
event
for
that
time
but
if
in
order
to
see
more
distinctly
an
event
which
would
have
taken
only
a
few
seconds
such
as
the
fall
of
a
mountain
an
avalanche
or
an
earthquake
you
were
to
delay
to
see
the
commencement
of
the
catastrophe
in
slackening
a
little
your
steps
on
those
of
light
you
would
see
the
progress
of
the
catastrophe
its
first
moment
its
second
and
so
on
successively
in
thus
nearly
following
the
light
you
would
only
see
the
end
after
an
hour
of
observation
the
event
would
last
for
you
an
hour
instead
of
a
few
seconds
you
would
see
the
rocks
or
the
stones
suspended
in
the
air
and
could
thus
ascertain
the
mode
of
production
of
the
phenomenon
and
its
incidental
delays
already
your
terrestrial
scientific
knowledge
enables
you
to
take
instantaneous
photographs
of
the
successive
aspects
of
rapid
phenomena
such
as
lightning
a
meteor
the
waves
of
the
sea
a
volcanic
eruption
the
fall
of
a
building
and
to
make
them
pass
before
you
graduated
in
accordance
with
their
effect
on
the
retina
similarly
you
can
on
the
contrary
photograph
the
pollen
of
a
flower
through
each
stage
of
expansion
to
its
completion
in
the
fruit
or
the
development
of
a
child
from
its
birth
to
maturity
and
project
these
phases
upon
a
screen
depicting
in
a
few
seconds
the
life
of
a
man
or
a
tree
sidenote
a
i
see
in
your
thoughts
that
you
compare
this
effect
to
that
of
a
microscope
which
would
magnify
time
that
is
exactly
what
it
is
we
thus
see
time
amplified
this
process
can
not
strictly
speaking
be
called
that
of
the
microscope
but
rather
that
of
a
or
of
a
to
see
time
from
afar
the
duration
of
a
reign
might
by
the
same
process
be
augmented
according
to
the
good
pleasure
of
the
parti
politique
thus
for
example
napoleon
ii
reigned
only
three
hours
but
one
could
see
him
reign
for
fifteen
years
by
dispersing
the
minutes
of
the
three
hours
over
the
length
of
months
in
removing
one
self
from
the
earth
with
a
velocity
a
little
inferior
to
that
of
light
so
by
setting
out
at
the
very
moment
that
the
chamber
had
proclaimed
napoleon
one
would
arrive
at
the
last
minute
of
his
supposed
reign
only
at
the
end
of
fifteen
years
each
minute
would
be
seen
for
a
month
each
second
for
twelve
hours

the
conclusions
of

entirely
on

my

endeavoured
to
show
you
that

one
of
the
elements
of
the
conditions

to

you
