the

the
text
of
the
school
for
scandal
in
this
edition
is
taken
by
fraser
rae
generous
permission
from
his
sheridan
plays
now
printed
as
he
wrote
them
in
his
prefatory
notes
xxxvii
rae
writes
the
manuscript
of
it
the
school
for
scandal
in
sheridan
own
handwriting
is
preserved
at
frampton
court
and
is
now
printed
in
this
volume
this
version
differs
in
many
respects
from
that
which
is
generally
known
and
i
think
it
is
even
better
than
that
which
has
hitherto
been
read
and
acted
as
i
have
endeavoured
to
reproduce
the
works
of
sheridan
as
he
wrote
them
i
may
be
told
that
he
was
a
bad
hand
at
punctuating
and
very
bad
at
spelling
but
sheridan
shortcomings
as
a
speller
have
been
exaggerated
lest
sheridan
shortcomings
either
in
spelling
or
in
punctuation
should
obscure
the
text
i
have
in
this
edition
inserted
in
brackets
some
explanatory
suggestions
it
has
seemed
best
also
to
adopt
a
uniform
method
for
indicating
and
abbreviations
of
the
names
of
characters
there
can
be
no
gain
to
the
reader
in
reproducing
for
example
sheridan
different
indications
for
the
part
of
lady
sneerwell
lady
sneerwell
lady
lady
and
lady
or
his
varying
use
of
exit
and
or
his
inconsistencies
in
the
use
of
italics
in
the
since
however
biographers
from
moore
to
fraser
rae
have
shown
that
no
authorised
or
correct
edition
of
the
school
for
scandal
was
published
in
lifetime
there
seems
unusual
justification
for
reproducing
the
text
of
the
play
itself
with
absolute
fidelity
to
the
original
manuscript
ridgway
who
repeatedly
sought
to
obtain
a
copy
corrected
by
the
author
according
to
moore
account
life
of
sheridan
was
told
by
sheridan
as
an
excuse
for
keeping
it
back
that
he
had
been
nineteen
years
endeavouring
to
satisfy
himself
with
the
style
of
the
school
for
scandal
but
had
not
yet
succeeded
rae
sheridan
recorded
his
discovery
of
the
manuscript
of
two
acts
of
the
school
for
scandal
prepared
by
sheridan
for
publication
and
hoped
before
his
death
to
publish
this
partial
revision
numberless
unauthorized
changes
in
the
play
have
been
made
for
histrionic
purposes
from
the
first
undated
dublin
edition
to
that
of
augustin
daly
current
texts
may
usually
be
traced
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
murray
edition
of
sheridan
plays
in
some
of
the
changes
from
the
original
manuscript
such
as
the
blending
of
the
parts
of
miss
verjuice
and
snake
are
doubtless
effective
for
reasons
of
dramatic
economy
but
many
of
the
cuts
are
to
be
regretted
from
the
reader
standpoint
the
student
of
english
drama
will
prefer
sheridan
own
text
to
editorial
emendations
however
clever
or
effective
for
dramatic
ends
the
school
for
scandal
addressed

crewe

is
the

to

whose
judgment
scorns

praising
amoret
we
can
not

yet
she
by

alone
would

she
moves
no

the
softer
charm
that
in
her
manner
lies
is
framed
to
captivate
yet
not
surprise
it
justly
suits
th
expression
of
her
face
is
less
than
dignity
and
more
than
grace
on
her
pure
cheek
the
native
hue
is
such
that
form
by
to
be
admired
so
much
the
hand
divine
with
a
less
partial
care
might
well
have
fix
a
fainter
crimson
there
and
bade
the
gentle
inmate
of
her
breast
inshrined
modesty
supply
the
rest
but
who

peril
of
her
lips
shall
paint
strip
them

thou
who
seest
her

and
dost
not
hear

accents

those
lips

pretence
to
judge
of
what
she
says
and

with
such
grace
with
such
expression
fraught
they
move
in
meaning
and
they
pause
in
thought
but
dost
thou
farther
watch
with
charm
surprise
the
mild
irresolution
of
her
eyes
curious
to
mark
how
frequent
they
repose
in
brief
eclipse
and
momentary
close
ah
seest
thou
not
an
ambush
cupid
there
too
of
his
charge
with
jealous
care
veils
and
unveils
those
beams
of
light
too
full
too
fatal
else
for
mortal
sight
nor
yet
such
pleasing
vengeance
fond
to
meet
in
dimples
hope
a
safe
retreat
what
though
her
peaceful
breast
should
allow
subduing
frowns
to
arm
her
altered
brow
by
love

and
by
his
gentle
wiles
more
fatal
still
the
mercy
of
her
smiles
thus
lovely
thus
adorn
possessing
all
of
bright

fair
that
can

gentle
amoret
in

supreme
as
well
as

the
vainer
theme

half
mistrustful

barbs
with

darts
too
keen

read
you
there
at
that
dash

yes
a
certain
lord
had
best
beware
who
lives
not
twenty
miles
from

wormwood
is
bitter
oh
that
me
the
villain
throw
it
behind
the
fire
and
never
more
let
that
vile
paper
come
within
my
door
thus
at
our
friends
we
laugh
who
feel
the
dart
to
reach
our

ourselves

is
our
young
bard
so
young
to
think
that
he
can
stop
the
full
of
calumny
knows
he
the
world
so
little
and
its

alas
the
devil
sooner
raised
than
laid
so

so

to

lady
sneerwell
the
paragraphs
you
say
were
all
inserted
verjuice
they
were
madam
and
as
i
copied
them
myself
in
a
feigned
hand
there
can
be
no
suspicion
whence
they
came
lady
sneerwell
did
you
circulate
the
report
of
lady
brittle
intrigue
with
captain
boastall
verjuice
madam
by
this
time
lady
brittle
is
the
talk
of
half
the
town
and
i
doubt
not
in
a
week
the
men
will
toast
her
as
a
demirep
lady
sneerwell
what
have
you
done
as
to
the
insinuation
as
to
a
certain
baronet
lady
and
a
certain
cook
verjuice
that
is
in
as
fine
a
train
as
your
ladyship
could
wish
i
told
the
story
yesterday
to
my
own
maid
with
directions
to
communicate
it
directly
to
my
hairdresser
he
i
am
informed
has
a
brother
who
courts
a
milliners
prentice
in
pallmall
whose
mistress
has
a
first
cousin
whose
sister
is
feme
femme
de
chambre
to
clackit
so
that
in
the
common
course
of
things
it
must
reach
clackit
ears
within
hours
and
then
you
know
the
business
is
as
good
as
done
lady
sneerwell
why
truly
clackit
has
a
very
pretty
talent
a
great
deal
of
industry
yet
yes
been
tolerably
successful
in
her
way
to
my
knowledge
she
has
been
the
cause
of
breaking
off
six
matches
of
three
sons
being
disinherited
and
four
daughters
being
turned
out
of
doors
of
three
several
elopements
as
many
close
confinements
nine
separate
maintenances
and
two
nay
i
have
more
than
once
traced
her
causing
a
in
the
town
and
country
magazine
when
the
parties
perhaps
had
never
seen
each
other
faces
before
in
the
course
of
their
lives
verjuice
she
certainly
has
talents
lady
sneerwell
but
her
manner
is
gross
verjuice
is
very
true
she
generally
designs
well
has
a
free
tongue
and
a
bold
invention
but
her
colouring
is
too
dark
and
her
outline
often
extravagant
she
wants
that
delicacy
of
tint
and
mellowness
of
sneer
which
distinguish
your
ladyship
scandal
lady
sneerwell
ah
you
are
partial
verjuice
verjuice
not
in
the
least
everybody
allows
that
lady
sneerwell
can
do
more
with
a
word
or
a
look
than
many
can
with
the
most
laboured
detail
even
when
they
happen
to
have
a
little
truth
on
their
side
to
support
it
lady
sneerwell
yes
my
dear
verjuice
i
am
no
hypocrite
to
deny
the
satisfaction
i
reap
from
the
success
of
my
efforts
wounded
myself
in
the
early
part
of
my
life
by
the
envenomed
tongue
of
slander
i
confess
i
have
since
known
no
pleasure
equal
to
the
reducing
others
to
the
level
of
my
own
injured
reputation
verjuice
nothing
can
be
more
natural
but
my
dear
lady
sneerwell
there
is
one
affair
in
which
you
have
lately
employed
me
wherein
i
confess
i
am
at
a
loss
to
guess
your
motives
lady
sneerwell
i
conceive
you
mean
with
respect
to
my
neighbour
sir
peter
teazle
and
his
family
and
has
my
conduct
in
this
matter
really
appeared
to
you
so
mysterious
exit
maid
verjuice
entirely
so
lady
sneerwell
an
old
batchelor
as
sir
peter
was
having
taken
a
young
wife
from
out
of
the
country
as
lady
teazle
is
are
certainly
fair
subjects
for
a
little
mischievous
raillery
but
here
are
two
young
men
to
whom
sir
peter
has
acted
as
a
kind
of
guardian
since
their
father
death
the
eldest
possessing
the
most
amiable
character
and
universally
well
spoken
of
the
youngest
the
most
dissipated
and
extravagant
young
fellow
in
the
kingdom
without
friends
or
caracter
the
former
one
an
avowed
admirer
of
yours
and
apparently
your
favourite
the
latter
attached
to
maria
sir
peter
ward
and
confessedly
beloved
by
her
now
on
the
face
of
these
circumstances
it
is
utterly
unaccountable
to
me
why
you
a
young
widow
with
no
great
jointure
should
not
close
with
the
passion
of
a
man
of
such
character
and
expectations
as
mr
surface
and
more
so
why
you
should
be
so
uncommonly
earnest
to
destroy
the
mutual
attachment
subsisting
between
his
brother
charles
and
maria
lady
sneerwell
then
at
once
to
unravel
this
mistery
i
must
inform
you
that
love
has
no
share
whatever
in
the
intercourse
between
mr
surface
and
me
verjuice
no
lady
sneerwell
his
real
attachment
is
to
maria
or
her
fortune
but
finding
in
his
brother
a
favoured
rival
he
has
been
obliged
to
mask
his
pretensions
and
profit
by
my
assistance
verjuice
yet
still
i
am
more
puzzled
why
you
should
interest
yourself
in
his
success
lady
sneerwell
heavens
how
dull
you
are
can
not
you
surmise
the
weakness
which
i
hitherto
thro
shame
have
concealed
even
from
you
must
i
confess
that
charles
that
libertine
that
extravagant
that
bankrupt
in
fortune
and
reputation

he
it
is
for
whom
i
am
thus
anxious
and
malicious
and
to
gain
whom
i
would
sacrifice
everything
verjuice
now
indeed
your
conduct
appears
consistent
and
i
no
longer
wonder
at
your
enmity
to
maria
but
how
came
you
and
surface
so
confidential
lady
sneerwell
for
our
mutual
interest
but
i
have
found
out
him
a
long
time
since
altho
he
has
contrived
to
deceive
everybody
beside
i
know
him
to
be
artful
selfish
and
malicious
while
with
sir
peter
and
indeed
with
all
his
acquaintance
he
passes
for
a
youthful
miracle
of
prudence
good
sense
and
benevolence
verjuice
yes
yes
i
know
sir
peter
vows
he
has
not
his
equal
in
england
and
above
all
he
praises
him
as
a
man
of
sentiment
lady
sneerwell
true
and
with
the
assistance
of
his
sentiments
and
hypocrisy
he
has
brought
sir
peter
entirely
in
his
interests
with
respect
to
maria
and
is
now
i
believe
attempting
to
flatter
lady
teazle
into
the
same
good
opinion
towards
him
while
poor
charles
has
no
friend
in
the
house
though
i
fear
he
has
a
powerful
one
in
maria
heart
against
whom
we
must
direct
our
schemes
servant
mr
surface
lady
sneerwell
shew
him
up
he
generally
calls
about
this
time
i
wonder
at
people
giving
him
to
me
for
a
lover
enter
surface
surface
my
dear
lady
sneerwell
how
do
you
do
your
most
obedient
lady
sneerwell
miss
verjuice
has
just
been
arraigning
me
on
our
mutual
attachment
now
but
i
have
informed
her
of
our
real
views
and
the
purposes
for
which
our
geniuses
at
present
you
know
how
useful
she
has
been
to
us
and
believe
me
the
confidence
is
not
surface
madam
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
suspect
that
a
lady
of
miss
verjuice
sensibility
and
discernment
lady
sneerwell
well
well
no
compliments
now
but
tell
me
when
you
saw
your
mistress
or
what
is
more
material
to
me
your
brother
surface
i
have
not
seen
either
since
i
saw
you
but
i
can
inform
you
that
they
are
at
present
at
variance
some
of
your
stories
have
taken
good
effect
on
maria
lady
sneerwell
ah
my
dear
verjuice
the
merit
of
this
belongs
to
you
but
do
your
brother
distresses
encrease
surface
every
hour
i
am
told
he
had
another
execution
in
his
house
yesterday
in
short
his
dissipation
and
extravagance
exceed
anything
i
have
ever
heard
of
lady
sneerwell
poor
charles
surface
true
madam
notwithstanding
his
vices
one
ca
help
feeling
for
him
ah
poor
charles
i
sure
i
wish
it
was
in
my
power
to
be
of
any
essential
service
to
him
for
the
man
who
does
not
share
in
the
distresses
of
a
brother
even
though
merited
by
his
own
misconduct
deserves
lady
sneerwell
o
lud
you
are
going
to
be
moral
and
forget
that
you
are
among
friends
surface
egad
that
true
i
keep
that
sentiment
till
i
see
sir
peter
however
it
is
certainly
a
charity
to
rescue
maria
from
such
a
libertine
who
if
he
is
to
be
reclaim
can
be
so
only
by
a
person
of
your
ladyship
superior
accomplishments
and
understanding
verjuice
be
a
hazardous
experiment
surface
but
madam
let
me
caution
you
to
place
no
more
confidence
in
our
friend
snake
the
libeller
i
have
lately
detected
him
in
frequent
conference
with
old
rowland
rowley
who
was
formerly
my
steward
and
has
never
been
a
friend
of
mine
lady
sneerwell
i
not
disappointed
in
snake
i
never
suspected
the
fellow
to
have
virtue
enough
to
be
faithful
even
to
his
own
villany
enter
maria
maria
my
dear
how
do
you
do
what
the
matter
maria
o
here
is
that
disagreeable
lover
of
mine
sir
benjamin
backbite
has
just
call
at
my
guardian
with
his
odious
uncle
crabtree
so
i
slipt
out
and
ran
hither
to
avoid
them
lady
sneerwell
is
that
all
verjuice
lady
sneerwell
i
go
and
write
the
letter
i
mention
to
you
surface
if
my
brother
charles
had
been
of
the
party
madam
perhaps
you
would
not
have
been
so
much
alarmed
lady
sneerwell
nay
now
you
are
severe
for
i
dare
swear
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
maria
heard
you
were
here
but
my
dear
what
has
sir
benjamin
done
that
you
should
avoid
him
so
maria
oh
he
has
done
nothing
but
his
conversation
is
a
perpetual
libel
on
all
his
acquaintance
surface
aye
and
the
worst
of
it
is
there
is
no
advantage
in
not
knowing
them
for
he
abuse
a
stranger
just
as
soon
as
his
best
friend
and
crabtree
is
as
bad
lady
sneerwell
nay
but
we
should
make
allowance
sir
benjamin
is
a
wit
and
a
poet
maria
for
my
part
i
own
madam
wit
loses
its
respect
with
me
when
i
see
it
in
company
with
what
do
you
think
mr
surface
surface
certainly
madam
to
smile
at
the
jest
which
plants
a
thorn
on
another
breast
is
to
become
a
principal
in
the
mischief
lady
sneerwell
pshaw
there
no
possibility
of
being
witty
without
a
little
ill
nature
the
malice
of
a
good
thing
is
the
barb
that
makes
it
what
your
opinion
mr
surface
surface
certainly
madam
that
conversation
where
the
spirit
of
raillery
is
suppressed
will
ever
appear
tedious
and
insipid
maria
well
i
not
debate
how
far
scandal
may
be
allowable
but
in
a
man
i
am
sure
it
is
always
we
have
pride
envy
rivalship
and
a
thousand
motives
to
depreciate
each
other
but
the
must
have
the
cowardice
of
a
woman
before
he
can
traduce
one
lady
sneerwell
i
wish
my
cousin
verjuice
had
left
us
she
should
embrace
you
surface
ah
she
an
old
maid
and
is
privileged
of
course
enter
servant
madam
candour
is
below
and
if
your
ladyship
at
leisure
will
leave
her
carriage
lady
sneerwell
beg
her
to
walk
in
now
maria
however
here
is
a
character
to
your
taste
for
tho
candour
is
a
little
talkative
everybody
allows
her
to
be
the
and
best
sort
of
woman
maria
yes
with
a
very
gross
affectation
of
good
nature
and
benevolence
she
does
more
mischief
than
the
direct
malice
of
old
crabtree
surface
efaith
is
very
true
lady
sneerwell
whenever
i
hear
the
current
running
again
the
characters
of
my
friends
i
never
think
them
in
such
danger
as
when
candour
undertakes
their
defence
lady
sneerwell
hush
here
she
is
enter
candour
candour
my
dear
lady
sneerwell
how
have
you
been
this
century
i
have
never
seen
you
tho
i
have
heard
of
you
very
mr
surface
the
world
says
scandalous
things
of
you
but
indeed
it
is
no
matter
what
the
world
says
for
i
think
one
hears
nothing
else
but
scandal
surface
just
so
indeed
candour
ah
maria
child
what
is
the
whole
affair
off
between
you
and
charles
his
extravagance
i
presume
the
town
talks
of
nothing
else
maria
i
am
very
sorry
the
town
has
so
little
to
do
candour
true
true
child
but
there
no
stopping
tongues
i
own
i
was
hurt
to
hear
it
as
i
indeed
was
to
learn
from
the
same
quarter
that
your
guardian
sir
peter
and
lady
teazle
have
not
agreed
lately
so
well
as
could
be
wish
maria
is
strangely
impertinent
for
people
to
busy
themselves
so
candour
very
true
child
but
what
to
be
done
people
will
talk
there
no
preventing
why
it
was
but
yesterday
i
was
told
that
miss
gadabout
had
eloped
with
sir
filagree
flirt
but
lord
there
is
no
minding
what
one
hears
tho
to
be
sure
i
had
this
from
very
good
authority
maria
such
reports
are
highly
scandalous
candour
so
they
are
child
shameful
shameful
but
the
world
is
so
censorious
no
character
escapes
lord
now
who
would
have
suspected
your
friend
miss
prim
of
an
indiscretion
yet
such
is
the
of
people
that
they
say
her
unkle
stopped
her
last
week
just
as
she
was
stepping
into
a
postchaise
with
her
maria
i
answer
there
are
no
grounds
for
the
report
candour
oh
no
foundation
in
the
world
i
dare
swear
no
more
probably
than
for
the
story
circulated
last
month
of
affair
with
colonel
cassino
tho
to
be
sure
that
matter
was
never
rightly
clear
up
surface
the
license
of
invention
some
people
take
is
monstrous
indeed
maria
is
so
but
in
my
opinion
those
who
report
such
things
are
equally
culpable
candour
to
be
sure
they
are
tale
bearers
are
as
bad
as
the
tale
makers
is
an
old
observation
and
a
very
true
one
but
what
to
be
done
as
i
said
before
how
will
you
prevent
people
from
talking
clackitt
assured
me
and
honeymoon
were
at
last
become
mere
man
and
wife
like
the
rest
of
their
acquaintance
she
likewise
hinted
that
a
certain
widow
in
the
next
street
had
got
rid
of
her
dropsy
and
recovered
her
shape
in
a
most
surprising
manner
at
the
same
time
miss
tattle
who
was
by
affirm
that
lord
boffalo
had
discover
his
lady
at
a
house
of
no
extraordinary
fame
and
that
sir
harry
bouquet
and
tom
saunter
were
to
measure
swords
on
a
similar
provocation
but
lord
do
you
think
i
would
report
these
things
no
no
tale
bearers
as
i
said
before
are
just
as
bad
as
the
talemakers
surface
ah
candour
if
everybody
had
your
forbearance
and
good
nature
candour
i
confess
mr
surface
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
people
traduced
behind
their
backs
and
when
ugly
circumstances
come
out
against
our
acquaintances
i
own
i
always
love
to
think
the
best
by
the
bye
i
hope
is
not
true
that
your
brother
is
absolutely
ruin
surface
i
am
afraid
his
circumstances
are
very
bad
indeed
candour
ah
i
heard
so
but
you
must
tell
him
to
keep
up
his
spirits
everybody
almost
is
in
the
same
way

up

hear

consolation

very
great
one

soh

you
see
your

positively
you
sha
escape

crabtree
and
sir
benjamin
backbite
crabtree
lady
sneerwell
i
kiss
your
hand
candour
i
do
believe
you
are
acquainted
with
my
nephew
sir
benjamin
backbite
egad
he
has
a
pretty
wit
and
is
a
pretty
poet
too
is
he
lady
sneerwell
sir
benjamin
o
fie
uncle
crabtree
nay
egad
it
true
i
back
him
at
a
rebus
or
a
charade
against
the
best
rhymer
in
the
kingdom
has
your
ladyship
heard
the
epigram
he
wrote
last
week
on
lady
frizzle
feather
catching
fire
do
benjamin
repeat
it
or
the
charade
you
made
last
night
extempore
at
drowzie
conversazione
come
now
your
first
is
the
name
of
a
fish
your
second
a
great
naval
commander
and
sir
benjamin
dear
uncle
now
prithee
crabtree
efaith
surprise
you
to
hear
how
ready
he
is
at
all
these
things
lady
sneerwell
i
wonder
sir
benjamin
you
never
publish
anything
sir
benjamin
to
say
truth
is
very
vulgar
to
print
and
as
my
little
productions
are
mostly
satires
and
lampoons
i
find
they
circulate
more
by
giving
copies
in
confidence
to
the
friends
of
the
parties
however
i
have
some
which
when
favoured
with
this
lady
smile
i
mean
to
give
to
the
public
pointing
to
maria
crabtree
heaven
they
immortalize
you
you
be
handed
down
to
posterity
like
petrarch
laura
or
waller
sacharissa
sir
benjamin
yes
madam
i
think
you
will
like
them
when
you
shall
see
in
a
beautiful
quarto
page
how
a
neat
rivulet
of
text
shall
meander
thro
a
meadow
of
margin
gad
they
will
be
the
most
elegant
things
of
their
kind
crabtree
but
ladies
have
you
heard
the
news
candour
what
sir
do
you
mean
the
report
of
crabtree
no
that
not
miss
nicely
is
going
to
be
married
to
her
own
footman
candour
impossible
crabtree
ask
sir
benjamin
sir
benjamin
is
very
true
everything
is
fixed
and
the
wedding
livery
bespoke
crabtree
yes
and
they
say
there
were
pressing
reasons
candour
it
can
not
be
and
i
wonder
any
one
should
believe
such
a
story
of
so
prudent
a
lady
as
miss
nicely
sir
benjamin
o
lud
that
the
very
reason
was
believed
at
once
she
has
always
been
so
cautious
and
so
reserved
that
everybody
was
sure
there
was
some
reason
for
it
at
bottom
lady
sneerwell
yes
a
tale
of
scandal
is
as
fatal
to
the
reputation
of
a
prudent
lady
of
her
stamp
as
a
fever
is
generally
to
those
of
the
strongest
constitutions
but
there
is
a
sort
of
puny
sickly
reputation
that
is
always
ailing
yet
will
outlive
the
robuster
characters
of
a
hundred
prudes
sir
benjamin
true
madam
there
are
valetudinarians
in
reputation
as
well
as
constitution
who
being
conscious
of
their
weak
part
avoid
the
least
breath
of
air
and
supply
their
want
of
stamina
by
care
and
circumspection
candour
well
but
this
may
be
all
mistake
you
know
sir
benjamin
very
trifling
circumstances
often
give
rise
to
the
most
injurious
tales
crabtree
that
they
do
i
be
sworn
did
you
ever
hear
how
miss
shepherd
came
to
lose
her
lover
and
her
character
last
summer
at
tunbridge
sir
benjamin
you
remember
it
sir
benjamin
o
to
be
sure
the
most
whimsical
circumstance
lady
sneerwell
how
was
it
pray
crabtree
why
one
evening
at
ponto
assembly
the
conversation
happened
to
turn
on
the
difficulty
of
breeding
sheep
in
this
country
says
a
young
lady
in
company
i
have
known
instances
of
it
for
miss
letitia
shepherd
a
first
cousin
of
mine
had
a
sheep
that
produced
her
what
cries
the
old
dowager
lady
dundizzy
who
you
know
is
as
deaf
as
a
post
has
miss
letitia
shepherd
had
twins
this
mistake
as
you
may
imagine
threw
the
whole
company
into
a
fit
of
laughing
however
was
the
next
morning
everywhere
reported
and
in
a
few
days
believed
by
the
whole
town
that
miss
letitia
shepherd
had
actually
been
brought
to
bed
of
a
fine
boy
and
girl
and
in
less
than
a
week
there
were
people
who
could
name
the
father
and
the
farm
house
where
the
babies
were
put
out
to
nurse
lady
sneerwell
strange
indeed
crabtree
matter
of
fact
i
assure
you
o
lud
mr
surface
pray
is
it
true
that
your
uncle
sir
oliver
is
coming
home
surface
not
that
i
know
of
indeed
sir
crabtree
he
has
been
in
the
east
indies
a
long
time
you
can
scarcely
remember
him
i
believe
sad
comfort
on
his
arrival
to
hear
how
your
brother
has
gone
on
surface
charles
has
been
imprudent
sir
to
be
sure
but
i
hope
no
busy
people
have
already
prejudiced
sir
oliver
against
him
he
may
reform
sir
benjamin
to
be
sure
he
may
for
my
part
i
never
believed
him
to
be
so
utterly
void
of
principle
as
people
say
and
tho
he
has
lost
all
his
friends
i
am
told
nobody
is
better
spoken
of
by
the
jews
crabtree
that
true
egad
nephew
if
the
old
jewry
was
a
ward
i
believe
charles
would
be
an
alderman
no
man
more
popular
there
gad
i
hear
he
pays
as
many
annuities
as
the
irish
tontine
and
that
whenever
he
sick
they
have
prayers
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
in
the
synagogue
sir
benjamin
yet
no
man
lives
in
greater
splendour
they
tell
me
when
he
entertains
his
friends
he
can
sit
down
to
dinner
with
a
dozen
of
his
own
securities
have
a
score
tradesmen
waiting
in
the
and
an
officer
behind
every
guest
chair
surface
this
may
be
entertainment
to
you
gentlemen
but
you
pay
very
little
regard
to
the
feelings
of
a
brother
maria
their
malice
is
intolerable
lady
sneerwell
i
must
wish
you
a
good
morning
i
not
very
well
exit

what
her
situation
may
be
exit
mrs
candour
lady
sneerwell
was
nothing
but
that
she
could
not
bear
to
hear
charles
reflected
on
notwithstanding
their
difference
sir
benjamin
the
young
lady
penchant
is
obvious
crabtree
but
benjamin
you
must
give
up
the
pursuit
for
that
follow

and
put
her
into
good
humour
repeat
her
some
of
your
verses
come
i
assist
you
sir
benjamin
mr
surface
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
but
depend
your

utterly
undone

o
lud
aye
undone
as

ca
raise
a
guinea
sir
benjamin
and
everything
sold
i
told
that
was
movable
going
crabtree
i
was
at
his
house
not
a
thing
left
but
some
empty
bottles
that
were
overlooked
and
the
family
pictures
which
i
believe
are
framed
in
the
wainscot
going
sir
benjamin
and
i
very
sorry
to
hear

some
bad
stories
against

is
your
brother
going
crabtree

ha
ha
is
very
hard
for
them
to
leave
a
subject
they
have
not
quite
run
down
surface
and
i
believe
the
abuse
was
no
more
acceptable
to
your
ladyship
than
maria
lady
sneerwell
i
doubt
her
affections
are
farther
engaged
than
we
imagin
but
the
family
are
to
be
here
this
evening
so
you
may
as
well
dine
where
you
are
and
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
observing
farther
in
the
meantime
i
go
and
plot
mischief
and
you
shall
study
sentiments
exeunt
scene
sir
peter
house
enter
sir
peter
sir
peter
when
an
old
bachelor
takes
a
young
wife
what
is
he
to
expect
is
now
six
months
since
lady
teazle
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
and
i
have
been
the
most
miserable
dog
ever
since
that
ever
committed
wedlock
we
tift
a
little
going
to
church
and
came
to
a
quarrel
before
the
bells
had
done
ringing
i
was
more
than
once
nearly
chok
with
gall
during
the
honeymoon
and
had
lost
all
comfort
in
life
before
my
friends
had
done
wishing
me
joy
yet
i
chose
with
caution
a
girl
bred
wholly
in
the
country
who
never
knew
luxury
beyond
one
silk
gown
nor
dissipation
above
the
annual
gala
of
a
yet
she
now
plays
her
part
in
all
the
extravagant
fopperies
of
the
fashion
and
the
town
with
as
ready
a
grace
as
if
she
had
never
seen
a
bush
nor
a
grass
plot
out
of
i
am
sneered
at
by
my
old
acquaintance
paragraphed
in
the
news
papers
she
dissipates
my
fortune
and
contradicts
all
my
humours
yet
the
worst
of
it
is
i
doubt
i
love
her
or
i
should
never
bear
all
this
however
i
never
be
weak
enough
to
own
it
enter
rowley
rowley
sir
peter
your
servant
how
is
with
you
sir
sir
peter
very
bad
master
rowley
very
bad
i
meet
with
nothing
but
crosses
and
vexations
rowley
what
can
have
happened
to
trouble
you
since
yesterday
sir
peter
a
good
question
to
a
married
man
rowley
nay
i
sure
your
lady
sir
peter
ca
be
the
cause
of
your
uneasiness
sir
peter
why
has
anybody
told
you
she
was
dead
rowley
come
come
sir
peter
you
love
her
notwithstanding
your
tempers
do
not
exactly
agree
sir
peter
but
the
fault
is
entirely
hers
master
rowley
i
am
myself
the
sweetest
temper
man
alive
and
hate
a
teasing
temper
and
so
i
tell
her
a
hundred
times
a
day
rowley
indeed
sir
peter
aye
and
what
is
very
extraordinary
in
all
our
disputes
she
is
always
in
the
wrong
but
lady
sneerwell
and
the
set
she
meets
at
her
house
encourage
the
perverseness
of
her
disposition
then
to
complete
my
vexations
maria
my
ward
whom
i
ought
to
have
the
power
of
a
father
over
is
determined
to
turn
rebel
too
and
absolutely
refuses
the
man
whom
i
have
long
resolved
on
for
her
husband
meaning
i
suppose
to
bestow
herself
on
his
profligate
brother
rowley
you
know
sir
peter
i
have
always
taken
the
liberty
to
differ
with
you
on
the
subject
of
these
two
young
gentlemen
i
only
wish
you
may
not
be
deceived
in
your
opinion
of
the
elder
for
charles
my
life
o
he
will
retrieve
his
errors
yet
their
worthy
father
once
my
honour
master
was
at
his
years
nearly
as
wild
a
spark
sir
peter
you
are
wrong
master
rowley
on
their
father
death
you
know
i
acted
as
a
kind
of
guardian
to
them
both
till
their
uncle
sir
oliver
eastern
bounty
gave
them
an
early
independence
of
course
no
person
could
have
more
opportunities
of
judging
of
their
hearts
and
i
was
never
mistaken
in
my
life
joseph
is
indeed
a
model
for
the
young
men
of
the
age
he
is
a
man
of
sentiment
and
acts
up
to
the
sentiments
he
professes
but
for
the
other
take
my
word
if
he
had
any
grain
of
virtue
by
descent
he
has
dissipated
it
with
the
rest
of
his
inheritance
ah
my
old
friend
sir
oliver
will
be
deeply
mortified
when
he
finds
how
part
of
his
bounty
has
been
misapplied
rowley
i
am
sorry
to
find
you
so
violent
against
the
young
man
because
this
may
be
the
most
critical
period
of
his
fortune
i
came
hither
with
news
that
will
surprise
you
sir
peter
what
let
me
hear
rowley
sir
oliver
is
arrived
and
at
this
moment
in
town
sir
peter
how
you
astonish
me
i
thought
you
did
not
expect
him
this
month
rowley
i
did
not
but
his
passage
has
been
remarkably
quick
sir
peter
egad
i
shall
rejoice
to
see
my
old
friend
is
sixteen
years
since
we
met
we
have
had
many
a
day
together
but
does
he
still
enjoin
us
not
to
inform
his
nephews
of
his
arrival
rowley
most
strictly
he
means
before
he
makes
it
known
to
make
some
trial
of
their
dispositions
and
we
have
already
planned
something
for
the
purpose
sir
peter
ah
there
needs
no
art
to
discover
their
merits
however
he
shall
have
his
way
but
pray
does
he
know
i
am
married
rowley
yes
and
will
soon
wish
you
joy
sir
peter
you
may
tell
him
is
too
late
ah
oliver
will
laugh
at
me
we
used
to
rail
at
matrimony
together
but
he
has
been
steady
to
his
text
well
he
must
be
at
my
house
tho
i
instantly
give
orders
for
his
reception
but
master
rowley
do
drop
a
word
that
lady
teazle
and
i
ever
disagree
rowley
by
no
means
sir
peter
for
i
should
never
be
able
to
stand
noll
jokes
so
i
have
him
think
that
we
are
a
very
happy
couple
rowley
i
understand
you
but
then
you
must
be
very
careful
not
to
differ
while
he
in
the
house
with
you
sir
peter
egad
and
so
we
must
that
impossible
ah
master
rowley
when
an
old
batchelor
marries
a
young
wife
he
deserves
no
the
crime
carries
the
punishment
along
with
it
exeunt
end
of
the
first
act
act
ii
scene
sir
peter
and
lady
teazle
sir
peter
lady
teazle
lady
teazle
i
not
bear
it
lady
teazle
sir
peter
sir
peter
you
may
scold
or
smile
according
to
your
humour
but
i
ought
to
have
my
own
way
in
everything
and
more
i
will
too
what
tho
i
was
educated
in
the
country
i
know
very
well
that
women
of
fashion
in
london
are
accountable
to
nobody
after
they
are
married
sir
peter
very
well
very
well
so
a
husband
is
to
have
no
influence
no
authority
lady
teazle
authority
no
to
be
sure
if
you
wanted
authority
over
me
you
should
have
adopted
me
and
not
married
me
i
am
sure
you
were
old
enough
sir
peter
old
enough
aye
there
it
is
well
well
lady
teazle
my
life
may
be
made
unhappy
by
your
temper
i
not
be
ruined
by
your
extravagance
lady
teazle
my
extravagance
i
sure
i
not
more
extravagant
than
a
woman
of
fashion
ought
to
be
sir
peter
no
no
madam
you
shall
throw
away
no
more
sums
on
such
unmeaning
luxury
to
spend
as
much
to
furnish
your
dressing
room
with
flowers
in
winter
as
would
suffice
to
turn
the
pantheon
into
a
greenhouse
and
give
a
fete
champetre
at
christmas
lady
teazle
lord
sir
peter
am
i
to
blame
because
flowers
are
dear
in
cold
weather
you
should
find
fault
with
the
climate
and
not
with
me
for
my
part
i
sure
i
wish
it
was
spring
all
the
year
round
and
that
roses
grew
under
one
feet
sir
peter
oons
madam
if
you
had
been
born
to
those
fopperies
i
should
wonder
at
your
talking
thus
but
you
forget
what
your
situation
was
when
i
married
you
lady
teazle
no
no
i
do
was
a
very
disagreeable
one
or
i
should
never
nave
married
you
sir
peter
yes
yes
madam
you
were
then
in
somewhat
a
humbler
style
the
daughter
of
a
plain
country
squire
recollect
lady
teazle
when
i
saw
you
first
sitting
at
your
tambour
in
a
pretty
figured
linen
gown
with
a
bunch
of
keys
at
your
side
and
your
apartment
hung
round
with
fruits
in
worsted
of
your
own
working
lady
teazle
o
horrible
horrible
do
put
me
in
mind
of
it
sir
peter
yes
yes
madam
and
your
daily
occupation
to
inspect
the
dairy
superintend
the
poultry
make
extracts
from
the
family
and
comb
your
aunt
deborah
lap
dog
lady
teazle
abominable
sir
peter
yes
madam
and
what
were
your
evening
amusements
to
draw
patterns
for
ruffles
which
you
had
the
materials
to
make
play
pope
joan
with
the
curate
to
read
a
sermon
to
your
aunt
or
be
stuck
down
to
an
old
spinet
to
strum
your
father
to
sleep
after
a
fox
chase
lady
teazle
scandalous
sir
peter
not
a
word
of
it
true
sir
peter
yes
madam
these
were
the
recreations
i
took
you
from
and
now
no
one
more
extravagantly
in
the
fashion
every
fopery
adopted
a
to
top
lady
pagoda
with
feathers
pendant
horizontal
and
perpendicular
you
forget
lady
teazle
when
a
little
wired
gauze
with
a
few
beads
made
you
a
fly
cap
not
much
bigger
than
a
and
your
hair
was
comb
smooth
over
a
roll
lady
teazle
shocking
horrible
roll
sir
peter
but
now
you
must
have
your
coach
and
three
powder
footmen
before
your
chair
and
in
the
summer
a
pair
of
white
cobs
to
draw
you
to
kensington
gardens
no
recollection
when
y
ou
were
content
to
ride
double
behind
the
butler
on
a
docked
lady
teazle
horrid
i
swear
i
never
did
sir
peter
this
madam
was
your
situation
and
what
have
i
not
done
for
you
i
have
made
you
woman
of
fashion
of
fortune
of
rank
in
short
i
have
made
you
my
wife
lady
teazle
well
then
and
there
is
but
one
thing
more
you
can
make
me
to
add
to
the
obligation
sir
peter
what
that
pray
lady
teazle
your
sir
peter
thank
you
madam
but
do
flatter
yourself
for
though
your
may
disturb
my
peace
it
shall
never
break
my
heart
i
promise
you
however
i
am
equally
obliged
to
you
for
the
hint
lady
teazle
then
why
will
you
endeavour
to
make
yourself
so
disagreeable
to
me
and
thwart
me
in
every
little
elegant
expense
sir
peter
madam
i
pray
had
you
any
of
these
elegant
expenses
when
you
married
me
lady
teazle
lud
sir
peter
would
you
have
me
be
out
of
the
fashion
sir
peter
the
fashion
indeed
what
had
you
to
do
with
the
fashion
before
you
married
me
lady
teazle
for
my
part
i
should
think
you
would
like
to
have
your
wife
thought
a
woman
of
taste
sir
peter
aye
there
again
taste
zounds
madam
you
had
no
taste
when
you
married
me
lady
teazle
that
very
true
indeed
sir
peter
after
having
married
you
i
should
never
pretend
to
taste
again
i
allow
sir
peter
so
so
then
madam
if
these
are
your
sentiments
pray
how
came
i
to
be
honour
with
your
hand
lady
teazle
shall
i
tell
you
the
truth
sir
peter
if
it
not
too
great
a
favour
lady
teazle
why
the
fact
is
i
was
tired
of
all
those
agreeable
recreations
which
you
have
so
good
naturally
naturedly
described
and
having
a
spirit
to
spend
and
enjoy
a
fortune
i
determined
to
marry
the
first
rich
man
that
would
have
me
sir
peter
a
very
honest
confession
truly
but
pray
madam
was
there
no
one
else
you
might
have
tried
to
ensnare
but
me
lady
teazle
o
lud
i
drew
my
net
at
several
but
you
were
the
only
one
i
could
catch
sir
peter
this
is
plain
dealing
indeed
lady
teazle
but
now
sir
peter
if
we
have
finish
our
daily
jangle
i
presume
i
may
go
to
my
engagement
at
lady
sneerwell
sir
peter
aye
there
another
precious
circumstance
a
charming
set
of
acquaintance
you
have
made
there
lady
teazle
nay
sir
peter
they
are
people
of
rank
and
fortune
and
remarkably
tenacious
of
reputation
sir
peter
yes
egad
they
are
tenacious
of
reputation
with
a
vengeance
for
they
do
chuse
anybody
should
have
a
character
but
themselves
such
a
crew
ah
many
a
wretch
has
rid
on
hurdles
who
has
done
less
mischief
than
these
utterers
of
forged
tales
coiners
of
scandal
and
clippers
of
reputation
lady
teazle
what
would
you
restrain
the
freedom
of
speech
sir
peter
aye
they
have
made
you
just
as
bad
as
any
one
of
the
society
lady
teazle
why
i
believe
i
do
bear
a
part
with
a
tolerable
grace
but
i
vow
i
bear
no
malice
against
the
people
i
abuse
when
i
say
an
thing
is
out
of
pure
good
humour
and
i
take
it
for
granted
they
deal
exactly
in
the
same
manner
with
me
but
sir
peter
you
know
you
promised
to
come
to
lady
sneerwell
too
sir
peter
well
well
i
call
in
just
to
look
after
my
own
character
lady
teazle
then
indeed
you
must
make
haste
after
me
or
you
be
too
late
so
good
bye
to
ye
sir
peter
so
i
have
gain
much
by
my
intended
expostulation
yet
with
what
a
charming
air
she
contradicts
every
thing
i
say
and
how
pleasingly
she
shows
her
contempt
of
my
authority
well
tho
i
make
her
love
me
there
is
certainly
a
great
satisfaction
in
quarrelling
with
her
and
i
think
she
never
appears
to
such
advantage
as
when
she
is
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
plague
me
exit
scene
at
lady
lady
sneerwell
candour
crabtree
sir
benjamin
backbite
and
surface
lady
sneerwell
nay
positively
we
will
hear
it
surface
yes
yes
the
epigram
by
all
means
sir
benjamin
o
plague
o
unkle
is
mere
nonsense
crabtree
no
no
gad
very
clever
for
an
extempore
sir
benjamin
but
ladies
you
should
be
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
you
must
know
that
one
day
last
week
as
lady
betty
curricle
was
taking
the
dust
in
high
park
in
a
sort
of
duodecimo
phaeton
she
desired
me
to
write
some
verses
on
her
ponies
upon
which
i
took
out
my
and
in
one
moment
produced
the
following
never
were
seen
two
such
beautiful
ponies
other
horses
are
clowns
and
these
macaronies
nay
to
give
this
title
i
sure
is
wrong
their
legs
are
so
slim
and
their
tails
are
so
long
crabtree
there
ladies
done
in
the
smack
of
a
whip
and
on
horseback
too
surface
a
very
phoebus
mounted
indeed
sir
benjamin
sir
benjamin
oh
dear
sir
trifles
trifles
enter
lady
teazle
and
maria
candour
i
must
have
a
copy
lady
sneerwell
lady
teazle
i
hope
we
shall
see

little
pleasure

however
i
do
as
you
please
lady
teazle
i
am
surprised
mr
surface
should
sit
down
her
i
thought
he
would
have
embraced
this
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
before
sir
peter
came
aside
candour
now
i
die
but
you
are
so
scandalous
i
forswear
your
society
lady
teazle

the
matter
candour
candour
they
not
allow
our
friend
miss
vermillion
to
be
handsome
lady
sneerwell
oh

she
is
a
pretty
woman
crabtree
i
am
very
glad
you
think

candour
she
has
a
charming
fresh
colour
crabtree
yes
when
it
is
fresh
put
on
lady
teazle
o
fie
i
swear
her
colour
is
natural
i
have
seen
it
come
and
go
crabtree
i
dare
swear
you
have
it
goes
of
a
night
and
comes
again
in
the
morning
sir
benjamin
true
uncle
it
not
only
comes
and
goes
but
what
more
egad
her
maid
can
fetch
and
carry
it
candour
ha
ha
ha
how
i
hate
to
hear
you
talk
so
but
surely
now
her
sister
is
or
was
very
handsome
crabtree
who
stucco
o
lud
she
if
she
an
hour
candour
now
positively
you
wrong
her
or
is
the
utmost
and
i
do
think
she
looks
more
sir
benjamin
ah
there
no
judging
by
her
looks
unless
one
was
to
see
her
face
lady
sneerwell
well
well
if
she
does
take
some
pains
to
repair
the
ravages
of
time
you
must
allow
she
effects
it
with
great
ingenuity
and
surely
that
better
than
the
careless
manner
in
which
the
widow
ocre
chaulks
her
wrinkles
sir
benjamin
nay
now
you
are
severe
upon
the
widow
come
come
it
is
that
she
paints
so
ill
but
when
she
has
finished
her
face
she
joins
it
on
so
badly
to
her
neck
that
she
looks
like
a
mended
statue
in
which
the
connoisseur
sees
at
once
that
the
head
modern
tho
the
trunk
antique
crabtree
ha
ha
ha
well
said
nephew
candour
ha
ha
ha
well
you
make
me
laugh
but
i
vow
i
hate
you
for
it
what
do
you
think
of
miss
simper
sir
benjamin
why
she
has
very
pretty
teeth
lady
teazle
yes
and
on
that
account
when
she
is
neither
speaking
nor
laughing
which
very
seldom
happens
she
never
absolutely
shuts
her
mouth
but
leaves
it
always
on
as
it
were
candour
how
can
you
be
so
lady
teazle
nay
i
allow
even
that
better
than
the
pains
prim
takes
to
conceal
her
losses
in
front
she
draws
her
mouth
till
it
resembles
the
aperture
of
a
and
all
her
words
appear
to
slide
out
edgewise
lady
sneerwell
very
well
lady
teazle
i
see
you
can
be
a
little
severe
lady
teazle
in
defence
of
a
friend
it
is
but
justice
but
here
comes
sir
peter
to
spoil
our
pleasantry
enter
sir
peter
sir
peter
ladies
your
obedient
mercy
on
me
here
is
the
whole
set
a
character
dead
at
every
word
i
suppose
candour
i
am
rejoiced
you
are
come
sir
peter
they
have
been
so
censorious
and
lady
teazle
as
bad
as
any
one
sir
peter
that
must
be
very
distressing
to
you
candour
i
dare
swear
candour
o
they
will
allow
good
qualities
to
nobody
not
even
good
nature
to
our
friend
pursy
lady
teazle
what
the
fat
dowager
who
was
at
quadrille
last
night
lady
sneerwell
nay
her
bulk
is
her
misfortune
and
when
she
takes
such
pains
to
get
rid
of
it
you
ought
not
to
reflect
on
her
candour
is
very
true
indeed
lady
teazle
yes
i
know
she
almost
lives
on
acids
and
small
whey
laces
herself
by
pulleys
and
often
in
the
hottest
noon
of
summer
you
may
see
her
on
a
little
squat
pony
with
her
hair
plaited
up
behind
like
a
drummer
and
puffing
round
the
ring
on
a
full
trot
candour
i
thank
you
lady
teazle
for
defending
her
sir
peter
yes
a
good
defence
truly
candour
but
for
sir
benjamin
he
is
as
censorious
as
miss
sallow
crabtree
yes
and
she
is
a
curious
being
to
pretend
to
be
censorious
an
awkward
gawky
without
any
one
good
point
under
heaven
lady
sneerwell
positively
you
shall
not
be
so
very
severe
miss
sallow
is
a
relation
of
mine
by
marriage
and
as
for
her
person
great
allowance
is
to
be
made
for
let
me
tell
you
a
woman
labours
under
many
disadvantages
who
tries
to
pass
for
a
girl
at
candour
tho
surely
she
is
handsome
still
and
for
the
weakness
in
her
eyes
considering
how
much
she
reads
by
it
is
not
to
be
wonder
at
lady
sneerwell
true
and
then
as
to
her
manner
upon
my
word
i
think
it
is
particularly
graceful
considering
she
never
had
the
least
education
for
you
know
her
mother
was
a
welch
milliner
and
her
father
a
at
sir
benjamin
ah
you
are
both
of
you
too
sir
peter
yes
damned
her
own
relation
mercy
on
me
aside
candour
for
my
part
i
own
i
can
not
bear
to
hear
a
friend
of
sir
peter
no
to
be
sure
sir
benjamin
ah
you
are
of
a
moral
turn
candour
and
can
sit
for
an
hour
to
hear
lady
stucco
talk
sentiments
lady
sneerwell
nay
i
vow
lady
stucco
is
very
well
with
the
dessert
after
dinner
for
she
just
like
the
spanish
fruit
one
cracks
for
mottoes
made
up
of
paint
and
proverb
candour
well
i
never
will
join
in
ridiculing
a
friend
and
so
i
constantly
tell
my
cousin
ogle
and
you
all
know
what
pretensions
she
has
to
be
critical
in
beauty
lady
teazle
o
to
be
sure
she
has
herself
the
oddest
countenance
that
ever
was
seen
is
a
collection
of
features
from
all
the
different
countries
of
the
globe
sir
benjamin
so
she
has
indeed
an
irish
front
crabtree
caledonian
locks
sir
benjamin
dutch
nose
crabtree
austrian
lips
sir
benjamin
complexion
of
a
spaniard
crabtree
and
teeth
a
la
chinoise
sir
benjamin
in
short
her
face
resembles
a
table
at
spa
where
no
two
guests
are
of
a
nation
crabtree
or
a
congress
at
the
close
of
a
general
war
wherein
all
the
members
even
to
her
eyes
appear
to
have
a
different
interest
and
her
nose
and
chin
are
the
only
parties
likely
to
join
issue
candour
ha
ha
ha
sir
peter
mercy
on
my
life
a
person
they
dine
with
twice
a
week
aside
lady
sneerwell
go
go
you
are
a
couple
of
provoking
toads
candour
nay
but
i
vow
you
shall
not
carry
the
laugh
off
so
for
give
me
leave
to
say
that
ogle
sir
peter
madam
madam
i
beg
your
pardon
there
no
stopping
these
good
gentlemen
tongues
but
when
i
tell
you
candour
that
the
lady
they
are
abusing
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
i
hope
you
not
take
her
part
lady
sneerwell
ha
ha
ha
well
said
sir
peter
but
you
are
a
cruel
creature
too
phlegmatic
yourself
for
a
jest
and
too
peevish
to
allow
wit
in
others
sir
peter
ah
madam
true
wit
is
more
nearly
allow
allied
to
good
nature
than
your
ladyship
is
aware
of
lady
sneerwell
true
sir
peter
i
believe
they
are
so
near
akin
that
they
can
never
be
united
sir
benjamin
o
rather
madam
suppose
them
man
and
wife
because
one
seldom
sees
them
together
lady
teazle
but
sir
peter
is
such
an
enemy
to
scandal
i
believe
he
would
have
it
put
down
by
parliament
sir
peter
heaven
madam
if
they
were
to
consider
the
sporting
with
reputation
of
as
much
importance
as
poaching
on
manors
and
pass
an
act
for
the
preservation
of
fame
there
are
many
would
thank
them
for
the
bill
lady
sneerwell
o
lud
sir
peter
would
you
deprive
us
of
our
privileges
sir
peter
aye
madam
and
then
no
person
should
be
permitted
to
kill
characters
or
run
down
reputations
but
qualified
old
maids
and
disappointed
lady
sneerwell
go
you
monster
candour
but
sure
you
would
not
be
quite
so
severe
on
those
who
only
report
what
they
hear
sir
peter
yes
madam
i
would
have
law
merchant
for
that
too
and
in
all
cases
of
slander
currency
whenever
the
drawer
of
the
lie
was
not
to
be
found
the
injured
party
should
have
a
right
to
come
on
any
of
the
indorsers
crabtree
well
for
my
part
i
believe
there
never
was
a
scandalous
tale
without
some
lady
sneerwell
come
ladies
shall
we
sit
down
to
cards
in
the
next
room
enter
servant
whispers
sir
peter
sir
peter
i
be
with
them
exit
servant
i
get
away
unperceived
lady
sneerwell
sir
peter
you
are
not
leaving
us
sir
peter
your
ladyship
must
excuse
me
i
called
away
by
particular
business
but
i
leave
my
character
behind
me
exit
sir
benjamin
well
certainly
lady
teazle
that
lord
of
yours
is
a
strange
being
i
could
tell
you
some
stories
of
him
would
make
you
laugh
heartily
if
he
wer
your
husband
lady
teazle
o
pray
do
mind
that
come
do
let
hear
join
the
rest
of
the
company
going
into
the
next
room
surface
maria
i
see
you
have
no
satisfaction
in
this
society
maria
how
is
it
possible
i
should
if
to
raise
malicious
smiles
at
the
infirmities
or
misfortunes
of
those
who
have
never
injured
us
be
the
province
of
wit
or
humour
heaven
grant
me
a
double
portion
of
dullness
surface
yet
they
appear
more
than
they
are
they
have
no
malice
at
heart
maria
then
is
their
conduct
still
more
contemptible
for
in
my
opinion
nothing
could
excuse
the
intemperance
of
their
tongues
but
a
natural
and
ungovernable
bitterness
of
mind
surface
undoubtedly
madam
and
it
has
always
been
a
sentiment
of
mine
that
to
propagate
a
malicious
truth
wantonly
is
more
despicable
than
to
falsify
from
revenge
but
can
you
maria
feel
thus
f
or
others
and
be
unkind
to
me
alone
nay
is
hope
to
be
denied
the
tenderest
maria
why
will
you
distress
me
by
renewing
this
subject
surface
ah
maria
you
would
not
treat
me
thus
and
oppose
your
guardian
sir
peter
wishes
but
that
i
see
that
my
profligate
brother
is
still
a
favour
rival
maria
ungenerously
urged
but
whatever
my
sentiments
of
that
unfortunate
young
man
are
be
assured
i
shall
not
feel
more
bound
to
give
him
up
because
his
distresses
have
sunk
him
so
low
as
to
deprive
him
of
the
regard
even
of
a
brother
surface
nay
but
maria
do
not
leave
me
with
a
frown
by
all
honest
i
swear
gad
life
here
lady
teazle
you
must
not
no
you
shall
for
tho
i
have
the
greatest
regard
for
lady
teazle
maria
lady
teazle
surface
yet
were
sir
peter
to
suspect
enter
lady
teazle
and
comes
forward
lady
teazle
what
this
pray
do
you
take
her
for
me
child
you
are
wanted
in
the
next
what
all
this
pray
surface
o
the
most
unlucky
circumstance
in
nature
maria
has
somehow
suspected
the
tender
concern
i
have
for
your
happiness
and
to
acquaint
sir
peter
with
her
suspicions
and
i
was
just
endeavouring
to
reason
with
her
when
you
came
lady
teazle
indeed
but
you
seem
to
adopt
a
very
tender
mode
of
reasoning
do
you
usually
argue
on
your
knees
surface
o
she
a
child
and
i
thought
a
little
bombast
but
lady
teazle
when
are
you
to
give
me
your
judgment
on
my
library
as
you
promised
lady
teazle
no
no
i
begin
to
think
it
would
be
imprudent
and
you
know
i
admit
you
as
a
lover
no
farther
than
fashion
requires
surface
true
a
mere
platonic
cicisbeo
what
every
london
wife
is
entitled
to
lady
teazle
certainly
one
must
not
be
out
of
the
fashion
however
i
have
so
much
of
my
country
prejudices
left
that
though
sir
peter
ill
humour
may
vex
me
ever
so
it
never
shall
provoke
me
to
surface
the
only
revenge
in
your
power
well
i
applaud
your
moderation
lady
teazle
go
you
are
an
insinuating
hypocrite
but
we
shall
be
miss
let
us
join
the
company
surface
true
but
we
had
best
not
return
together
lady
teazle
well
do
stay
for
maria
sha
come
to
hear
any
more
of
your
reasoning
i
promise
you
exit
surface
a
curious
dilemma
truly
my
politics
have
run
me
into
i
wanted
at
first
only
to
ingratiate
myself
with
lady
teazle
that
she
might
not
be
my
enemy
with
maria
and
i
have
i
do
know
how
become
her
serious
lover
so
that
i
stand
a
chance
of
committing
a
crime
i
never
meditated
and
probably
of
losing
maria
by
the
pursuit
sincerely
i
begin
to
wish
i
had
never
made
such
a
point
of
gaining
so
very
good
a
character
for
it
has
led
me
into
so
many
curst
rogueries
that
i
doubt
i
shall
be
exposed
at
last
exit
scene
at
sir
rowley
and
sir
oliver
sir
oliver
ha
ha
ha
and
so
my
old
friend
is
married
hey
a
young
wife
out
of
the
country
ha
ha
that
he
should
have
stood
bluff
to
old
bachelor
so
long
and
sink
into
a
husband
at
last
rowley
but
you
must
not
rally
him
on
the
subject
sir
oliver
is
a
tender
point
i
assure
you
though
he
has
been
married
only
seven
months
sir
oliver
ah
then
he
has
been
just
half
a
year
on
the
stool
of
repentance
poor
peter
but
you
say
he
has
entirely
given
up
charles
never
sees
him
hey
rowley
his
prejudice
against
him
is
astonishing
and
i
am
sure
greatly
increased
by
a
jealousy
of
him
with
lady
teazle
which
he
has
been
industriously
led
into
by
a
scandalous
society
in
the
neighbourhood
who
have
contributed
not
a
little
to
charles
ill
name
whereas
the
truth
is
i
believe
if
the
lady
is
partial
to
either
of
them
his
brother
is
the
favourite
sir
oliver
aye
i
know
there
are
a
set
of
malicious
prating
prudent
gossips
both
male
and
female
who
murder
characters
to
kill
time
and
will
rob
a
young
fellow
of
his
good
name
before
he
has
years
to
know
the
value
of
it
but
i
am
not
to
be
prejudiced
against
my
nephew
by
such
i
promise
you
no
no
if
charles
has
done
nothing
false
or
mean
i
shall
compound
for
his
extravagance
rowley
then
my
life
o
you
will
reclaim
him
ah
sir
it
gives
me
new
vigour
to
find
that
your
heart
is
not
turned
against
him
and
that
the
son
of
my
good
old
master
has
one
friend
however
left
sir
oliver
what
shall
i
forget
master
rowley
when
i
was
at
his
house
myself
egad
my
brother
and
i
were
neither
of
us
very
prudent
youths
and
yet
i
believe
you
have
not
seen
many
better
men
than
your
old
master
was
rowley
is
this
reflection
gives
me
assurance
that
charles
may
yet
be
a
credit
to
his
family
but
here
comes
sir
peter
sir
oliver
egad
so
he
does
mercy
on
me
he
greatly
altered
and
seems
to
have
a
settled
married
look
one
may
read
husband
in
his
face
at
this
enter

time

begin
on
grievances
at
first
meeting
no
no
rowley
take
care
pray
sir
sir
oliver
well
so
one
of
my
nephews

wild
rogue

my
old
friend

grieve
for
your
disappointment

a
lost
young

make
you
amends

a
youth
should
be

the
world

well
of
him
sir
oliver
i
am
sorry
to
hear
it
he
has
too
good
a
character
to
be
an
honest
fellow
everybody
speaks
well
of
him
psha
then
he
has
bow
as
low
to
knaves
and
fools
as
to
the
honest
dignity
of
virtue
sir
peter
what
sir
oliver
do
you
blame
him
for
not
making
enemies
sir
oliver
yes
if
he
has
merit
enough
to
deserve
them
sir
peter
well
well
you
be
convinced
when
you
know
him
is
edification
to
hear
him
converse
he
professes
the
noblest
sentiments
sir
oliver
ah
plague
on
his
sentiments
if
he
salutes
me
with
a
scrap
sentence
of
morality
in
his
mouth
i
shall
be
sick
directly
but
however
do
mistake
me
sir
peter
i
do
mean
to
defend
charles
errors
but
before
i
form
my
judgment
of
either
of
them
i
intend
to
make
a
trial
of
their
hearts
and
my
friend
rowley
and
i
have
planned
something
for
the
purpose
rowley
and
sir
peter
shall
own
he
has
been
for
once
mistaken
sir
peter
my
life
on
joseph
honour
sir
oliver
well
come
give
us
a
bottle
of
good
wine
and
we
drink
the
lads
healths
and
tell
you
our
scheme
sir
peter
alons
allons
then
sir
oliver
but
do
sir
peter
be
so
severe
against
your
old
son
sir
peter
is
his
vices
and
follies
have
made
me
his
rowley
come
come
sir
peter
consider
how
early
he
was
left
to
his
own
guidance
sir
oliver
odds
my
life
i
am
not
sorry
that
he
has
run
out
of
the
course
a
little
for
my
part
i
hate
to
see
dry
prudence
clinging
to
the
green
juices
of
youth
is
like
ivy
round
a
sapling
and
spoils
the
growth
of
the
tree
end
of
the
second
act
act
iii
scene
at
sir
sir
peter
sir
oliver
and
rowley
sir
peter
well
then
we
will
see
the
fellows
first
and
have
our
wine
but
how
is
this
master
rowley
i
do
see
the
jet
of
your
scheme
rowley
why
sir
this
stanley
whom
i
was
speaking
of
is
nearly
related
to
them
by
their
mother
he
was
once
a
merchant
in
dublin
but
has
been
ruined
by
a
series
of
undeserved
misfortunes
and
now
lately
coming
over
to
solicit
the
assistance
of
his
friends
here
has
been
flyng
flung
into
prison
by
some
of
his
creditors
where
he
is
now
with
two
helpless
sir
oliver
aye
and
a
worthy
fellow
too
i
remember
him
but
what
is
this
to
lead
to
rowley
you
shall
hear
he
has
applied
by
letter
both
to
mr
surface
and
charles
from
the
former
he
has
received
nothing
but
evasive
promises
of
future
service
while
charles
has
done
all
that
his
extravagance
has
left
him
power
to
do
and
he
is
at
this
time
endeavouring
to
raise
a
sum
of
money
part
of
which
in
the
midst
of
his
own
distresses
i
know
he
intends
for
the
service
of
poor
stanley
sir
oliver
ah
he
is
my
brother
son
sir
peter
well
but
how
is
sir
oliver
personally
to
rowley
why
sir
i
will
inform
charles
and
his
brother
that
stanley
has
obtain
permission
to
apply
in
person
to
his
friends
and
as
they
have
neither
of
them
ever
seen
him
let
sir
oliver
assume
his
character
and
he
will
have
a
fair
opportunity
of
judging
at
least
of
the
benevolence
of
their
dispositions
sir
peter
pshaw
this
will
prove
nothing
i
make
no
doubt
charles
is
coxcomb
and
thoughtless
enough
to
give
money
to
poor
relations
if
he
had
it
sir
oliver
then
he
shall
never
want
it
i
have
brought
a
few
rupees
home
with
me
sir
peter
and
i
only
want
to
be
sure
of
bestowing
them
rowley
then
sir
believe
me
you
will
find
in
the
youngest
brother
one
who
in
the
midst
of
folly
and
dissipation
has
still
as
our
immortal
bard
expresses
it
a
tear
for
pity
and
a
hand
open
as
the
day
for
melting
charity
sir
peter
pish
what
signifies
his
having
an
open
hand
or
purse
either
when
he
has
nothing
left
to
give
but
if
you
talk
of
humane
sentiments
joseph
is
the
man
well
well
make
the
trial
if
you
please
but
where
is
the
fellow
whom
you
brought
for
sir
oliver
to
examine
relative
to
charles
affairs
rowley
below
waiting
his
commands
and
no
one
can
give
him
better
intelligence
this
sir
oliver
is
a
friendly
jew
who
to
do
him
justice
has
done
everything
in
his
power
to
bring
your
nephew
to
a
proper
sense
of
his
extravagance
sir
peter
pray
let
us
have
him
in
rowley
desire
moses
to
walk
upstairs
calls
to
servant
sir
peter
but
pray
why
should
you
suppose
he
will
speak
the
truth
rowley
oh
i
have
convinced
him
that
he
has
no
chance
of
recovering
certain
sums
advanced
to
charles
but
through
the
bounty
of
sir
oliver
who
he
knows
is
arrived
so
that
you
may
depend
on
his
fidelity
to
his
interest
i
have
also
another
evidence
in
my
power
one
snake
whom
i
shall
shortly
produce
to
remove
some
of
your
prejudices
sir
peter
relative
to
charles
and
lady
teazle
sir
peter
i
have
heard
too
much
on
that
subject
rowley
here
comes
the
honest
israelite
enter
moses
this
is
sir
oliver
sir
oliver
sir
i
understand
you
have
lately
had
great
dealings
with
my
nephew
charles
moses
yes
sir
oliver
i
have
done
all
i
could
for
him
but
he
was
ruined
before
he
came
to
me
for
assistance
sir
oliver
that
was
unlucky
truly
for
you
have
had
no
opportunity
of
showing
your
talents
moses
none
at
all
i
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
his
distresses
till
he
was
some
thousands
worse
than
nothing
till
it
was
impossible
to
add
to
them
sir
oliver
unfortunate
indeed
but
i
suppose
you
have
done
all
in
your
power
for
him
honest
moses
moses
yes
he
knows
that
this
very
evening
i
was
to
have
brought
him
a
gentleman
from
the
city
who
does
not
know
him
and
will
i
believe
advance
some
money
sir
peter
what
one
charles
has
never
had
money
from
before
moses
yes
mr
premium
of
crutched
friars
sir
peter
egad
sir
oliver
a
thought
strikes
me
charles
you
say
know
mr
premium
moses
not
at
all
sir
peter
now
then
sir
oliver
you
may
have
a
better
opportunity
of
satisfying
yourself
than
by
an
old
romancing
tale
of
a
poor
relation
go
with
my
friend
moses
and
represent
mr
premium
and
then
i
answer
you
see
your
nephew
in
all
his
glory
sir
oliver
egad
i
like
this
idea
better
than
the
other
and
i
may
visit
joseph
afterwards
as
old
stanley
sir
peter
true
so
you
may
rowley
well
this
is
taking
charles
rather
at
a
disadvantage
to
be
sure
however
moses
you
understand
sir
peter
and
will
be
faithful
moses
you
may
depend
upon
me
and
this
is
near
the
time
i
was
to
have
gone
sir
oliver
i
accompany
you
as
soon
as
you
please
moses
but
hold
i
have
forgot
one
thing
how
the
plague
shall
i
be
able
to
pass
for
a
jew
moses
there
no
need
the
principal
is
christian
sir
oliver
is
he
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
but
then
again
a
i
rather
too
smartly
dressed
to
look
like
a
sir
peter
not
at
all
not
be
out
of
character
if
you
went
in
your
own
carriage
would
it
moses
moses
not
in
the
least
sir
oliver
well
but
how
must
i
talk
there
certainly
some
cant
of
usury
and
mode
of
treating
that
i
ought
to
know
sir
peter
oh
there
not
much
to
learn
the
great
point
as
i
take
it
is
to
be
exorbitant
enough
in
your
demands
hey
moses
moses
yes
that
very
great
point
sir
oliver
i
answer
i
not
be
wanting
in
that
i
ask
him
eight
or
ten
per
cent
on
the
loan
at
least
moses
you
be
found
out
directly
if
you
ask
him
no
more
than
that
you
be
discovered
immediately
sir
oliver
hey
what
the
plague
how
much
then
moses
that
depends
upon
the
circumstances
if
he
appears
not
very
anxious
for
the
supply
you
should
require
only
forty
or
fifty
per
but
if
you
find
him
in
great
distress
and
want
the
monies
very
bad
you
may
ask
double
sir
peter
a
good
h
onest
trade
you
learning
sir
oliver
sir
oliver
truly
i
think
so
and
not
unprofitable
moses
then
you
know
you
have
the
monies
yourself
but
are
forced
to
borrow
them
for
him
of
a
friend
sir
oliver
o
i
borrow
it
of
a
friend
do
i
moses
and
your
friend
is
an
unconscion
dog
but
you
ca
help
it
sir
oliver
my
friend
an
unconscionable
dog
is
he
moses
yes
and
he
himself
has
the
monies
by
him
but
is
forced
to
sell
stock
at
a
great
loss
sir
oliver
he
is
forced
to
sell
stock
is
he
at
a
great
loss
is
he
well
that
very
kind
of
him
sir
peter
efaith
sir
oliver
mr
premium
i
mean
you
soon
be
master
of
the
trade
but
moses
would
have
him
inquire
if
the
borrower
is
a
minor
moses
o
yes
sir
peter
and
in
that
case
his
conscience
will
direct
him
moses
to
have
the
bond
in
another
name
to
be
sure
sir
oliver
well
well
i
shall
be
perfect
sir
peter
but
hearkee
would
you
have
him
also
run
out
a
little
against
the
annuity
bill
that
would
be
in
character
i
should
think
moses
very
much
rowley
and
lament
that
a
young
man
now
must
be
at
years
of
discretion
before
he
is
suffered
to
ruin
himself
moses
aye
great
pity
sir
peter
and
abuse
the
public
for
allowing
merit
to
an
act
whose
only
object
is
to
snatch
misfortune
and
imprudence
from
the
rapacious
relief
of
usury
and
give
the
minor
a
chance
of
inheriting
his
estate
without
being
undone
by
coming
into
possession
sir
oliver
so
so
moses
shall
give
me
further
instructions
as
we
go
together
sir
peter
you
will
not
have
much
time
for
your
nephew
lives
hard
bye
sir
oliver
oh
never
fear
my
tutor
appears
so
able
that
tho
charles
lived
in
the
next
street
it
must
be
my
own
fault
if
i
am
not
a
compleat
rogue
before
i
turn
the
corner
exeunt
sir
oliver
and
moses
sir
peter
so
now
i
think
sir
oliver
will
be
convinced
you
follow
them
rowley
you
are
partial
and
would
have
prepared
charles
for
plot
rowley
no
upon
my
word
sir
peter
sir
peter
well
go
bring
me
this
snake
and
i
hear
what
he
has
to
say
presently
i
see
maria
and
want
to
speak
with
exit
rowley
i
should
be
glad
to
be
convinced
my
suspicions
of
lady
teazle
and
charles
were
unjust
i
have
never
yet
opened
my
mind
on
this
subject
to
my
friend
joseph
i
am
determined
i
will
do
it
he
will
give
me
his
opinion
enter
maria
so
child
has
mr
surface
returned
with
you
maria
no
sir
he
was
engaged
sir
peter
well
maria
do
you
not
reflect
the
more
you
converse
with
that
amiable
young
man
what
return
his
partiality
for
you
deserves
maria
indeed
sir
peter
your
frequent
importunity
on
this
subject
distresses
me
extremely
you
compell
me
to
declare
that
i
know
no
man
who
has
ever
paid
me
a
particular
attention
whom
i
would
not
prefer
to
mr
surface
sir
peter
soh
here
perverseness
no
no
maria
is
charles
only
whom
you
would
prefer
is
evident
his
vices
and
follies
have
won
your
heart
maria
this
is
unkind
sir
you
know
i
have
obey
you
in
neither
seeing
nor
corresponding
with
him
i
have
heard
enough
to
convince
me
that
he
is
unworthy
my
regard
yet
i
can
not
think
it
culpable
if
while
my
understanding
severely
condemns
his
vices
my
heart
suggests
some
pity
for
his
distresses
sir
peter
well
well
pity
him
as
much
as
you
please
but
give
your
heart
and
hand
to
a
worthier
object
maria
never
to
his
brother
sir
peter
go
perverse
and
obstinate
but
take
care
madam
you
have
never
yet
known
what
the
authority
of
a
guardian
is
do
compel
me
to
inform
you
of
maria
i
can
only
say
you
shall
not
have
just
reason
is
true
by
my
father
will
i
am
for
a
short
period
bound
to
regard
you
as
his
substitute
but
i
must
cease
to
think
you
so
when
you
would
compel
me
to
be
miserable
exit
sir
peter
was
ever
man
so
crossed
as
i
am
everything
conspiring
to
fret
me
i
had
not
been
involved
in
matrimony
a
fortnight
before
her
father
a
hale
and
hearty
man
died
on
purpose
i
believe
for
the
pleasure
of
plaguing
me
with
the
care
of
his
daughter
but
here
comes
my
helpmate
she
appears
in
great
good
humour

her
into

be
who

be
most
obliging
lady
teazle
i
assure
you
sir
peter
good
nature
becomes
you
you
look
now
as
you
did
before
we
were
married
when
you
used
to
walk
with
me
under
the
elms
and
tell
me
stories
of
what
a
gallant
you
were
in
your
youth
and
chuck
me
under
the
chin
you
would
and
ask
me
if
i
thought
i
could
love
an
old
fellow
who
would
deny
me
nothing
did
you
sir
peter
yes
yes
and
you
were
as
kind
and
attentive
lady
teazle
aye
so
i
was
and
would
always
take
your
part
when
my
acquaintance
used
to
abuse
you
and
turn
you
into
ridicule
sir
peter
indeed
lady
teazle
aye
and
when
my
cousin
sophy
has
called
you
a
stiff
peevish
old
batchelor
and
laugh
at
me
for
thinking
of
marrying
one
who
might
be
my
father
i
have
always
defended
you
and
said
i
did
think
you
so
ugly
by
any
means
and
that
you
make
a
very
good
sort
of
a
husband
sir
peter
and
you
prophesied
right
and
we
shall
certainly
now
be
the
happiest
couple
lady
teazle
and
never
differ
again
sir
peter
no
never
tho
at
the
same
time
indeed
my
dear
lady
teazle
you
must
watch
your
temper
very
narrowly
for
in
all
our
little
quarrels

moses
sir
oliver
if
the
man
be
a
shadow
of
his
master
this
is
the
temple
of
dissipation
indeed
exeunt
scene
charles
careless
etc
at
table
with
wine
charles
heaven
is
true
there
is
the
great
degeneracy
of
the
age
many
of
our
acquaintance
have
taste
spirit
and
politeness
but
plague
o
they
wo
drink
careless
it
is
so
indeed
charles
they
give
into
all
the
substantial
luxuries
of
the
table
and
abstain
from
nothing
but
wine
and
wit
oh
certainly
society
suffers
by
it
intolerably
for
now
instead
of
the
social
spirit
of
raillery
that
used
to
mantle
over
a
glass
of
bright
burgundy
their
conversation
is
become
just
like
the
spa
water
they
drink
which
has
all
the
pertness
and
flatulence
of
champaine
without
its
spirit
or
flavour
first
gentleman
but
what
are
they
to
do
who
love
play
better
than
wine
careless
true
there
harry
diets
himself
for
gaming
and
is
now
under
a
hazard
regimen
charles
then
he
have
the
worst
of
it
what
you
would
train
a
horse
for
the
course
by
keeping
him
from
corn
for
my
part
egad
i
am
never
so
successful
as
when
i
a
little
merry
let
me
throw
on
a
bottle
of
champaine
and
i
never
lose
at
least
i
never
feel
my
losses
which
is
exactly
the
same
thing
second
gentleman
aye
that
may
be
but
it
is
as
impossible
to
follow
wine
and
play
as
to
unite
love
and
politics
charles
pshaw
you
may
do
both
caesar
made
love
and
laws
in
a
breath
and
was
liked
by
the
senate
as
well
as
the
ladies
but
no
man
can
pretend
to
be
a
believer
in
love
who
is
an
abjurer
of
wine
is
the
test
by
which
a
lover
knows
his
own
heart
fill
a
dozen
bumpers
to
a
dozen
beauties
and
she
that
floats
atop
is
the
maid
that
has
bewitched
you
careless
now
then
charles
be
honest
and
give
us
yours
charles
why
i
have
withheld
her
only
in
compassion
to
you
if
i
toast
her
you
should
give
a
round
of
her
peers
which
is
impossible
on
earth
careless
o
then
we
find
some
canonized
vestals
or
heathen
goddesses
that
will
do
i
warrant
charles
here
then
bumpers

rogues
bumpers
maria
maria
first

dimples
we
prize
now
to
the
maid
who
has
none

berry
here
to

this
is
mr

a
gentleman
of
the
strictest
honour
and
secrecy
and
always
performs
what
he
undertakes
mr
premium
this
is
charles
psha
have
done
sir
my
friend
moses
is
a
very
honest
fellow
but
a
little
slow
at
expression
he
be
an
hour
giving
us
our
titles
mr
premium
the
plain
state
of
the
matter
is
this
i
am
an
extravagant
young
fellow
who
wants
to
borrow
money
you
i
take
to
be
a
prudent
old
fellow
who
have
got
money
to
lend
i
am
blockhead
enough
to
give
fifty
per
cent
sooner
than
not
have
it
and
you
i
presume
are
rogue
enough
to
take
a
hundred
if
you
can
get
it
now
sir
you
see
we
are
acquainted
at
once
and
may
proceed
to
business
without
further
ceremony
sir
oliver
exceeding
frank
upon
my
word
i
see
sir
you
are
not
a
man
of
many
compliments
charles
oh
no
sir
plain
dealing
in
business
i
always
think
best
sir
oliver
sir
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
however
you
are
mistaken
in
one
thing
i
have
no
money
to
lend
but
i
believe
i
could
procure
some
of
a
friend
but
then
he
an
unconscionable
dog
is
he
moses
and
must
sell
stock
to
accommodate
you
must
he
moses
moses
yes
indeed
you
know
i
always
speak
the
truth
and
scorn
to
tell
a
lie
charles
right
people
that
speak
truth
generally
do
but
these
are
trifles
mr
premium
what
i
know
money
is
to
be
bought
without
paying
sir
oliver
well
but
what
security
could
you
give
you
have
no
land
i
suppose
charles
not
a
nor
a
twig
but
what
in
the
bough
pots
out
of
the
window
sir
oliver
nor
any
stock
i
presume
charles
nothing
but
live
stock
and
that
only
a
few
pointers
and
ponies
but
pray
mr
premium
are
you
acquainted
at
all
with
any
of
my
connections
sir
oliver
why
to
say
the
truth
i
am
charles
then
you
must
know
that
i
have
a
devilish
rich
uncle
in
the
east
indies
sir
oliver
surface
from
whom
i
have
the
greatest
expectations
sir
oliver
that
you
have
a
wealthy
uncle
i
have
heard
but
how
your
expectations
will
turn
out
is
more
i
believe
than
you
can
tell
charles
oh
no
there
can
be
no
doubt
they
tell
me
i
a
prodigious
favourite
and
that
he
talks
of
leaving
me
everything
sir
oliver
indeed
this
is
the
first
i

liberal
to

be
very
sorry
to

that
anything
had
happened
to
him
sir

the
bond
you

happens
to
be
just
the
worst
security
you

offer
me
for
i
might
live
to
a
hundred
and
never
see
the
principal
charles
oh

you
would
the
moment
sir
oliver
dies
you
know
you
would
come
on
me
for
the

i
believe
i
should
be
the
most
unwelcome
dun
you
ever
had
in
your
life
charles
what
i
suppose
you
afraid
that
sir
oliver
is
too
good
a
life

not

have
heard
he
is
as
hale
and
healthy
as
any
man
of
his
years
in
christendom
charles
there
again

are
misinformed

hurt
him
considerably

sir
oliver

at
this
moment
at
calcutta

moses
moses

sir
oliver
very
true
as
you
say
you

better
than

though
i
have
it
from
pretty
good
authority
have
i
moses
moses
yes
most
undoubted
sir
oliver
but
sir
as
i
understand
you
want
a
few
hundreds
immediately
is
there
nothing
you
could
dispose
of
charles
how
do
you
mean
sir
oliver
for
instance
now
i
have
heard
that
your
father
left
behind
him
a
great
quantity
of
massy
old
plate
charles
o
lud
that
gone
long
ago
moses
can
tell
you
how
better
than
i
can
sir
oliver
aside
good
lack
all
the
family
and
aloud
then
it
was
also
supposed
that
his
library
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
and
compact
charles
yes
yes
so
it
was
vastly
too
much
so
for
a
private
gentleman
for
my
part
i
was
always
of
a
communicative
disposition
so
i
thought
it
a
shame
to
keep
so
much
knowledge
to
myself
sir
oliver
aside
mercy
upon
me
learning
that
had
run
in
the
family
like
an
aloud
pray
what
has
become
of
the
books
charles
you
must
inquire
of
the
auctioneer
master
premium
for
i
believe
even
moses
can
direct
you
moses
i
know
nothing
of
books
sir
oliver
so
so
nothing
of
the
family
property
left
i
suppose
charles
not
much
indeed
unless
you
have
a
mind
to
the
family
pictures
i
have
got
a
room
full
of
ancestors
above
and
if
you
have
a
taste
for

a
bargain

in
my
opinion
a
goodly
collection
charles
ay
ay
these
are
done
in
the
true
spirit
of
no
volontiere
grace
or
expression
not
like
the
works
of
your
modern
raphaels
who
give
you
the
strongest
resemblance
yet
contrive
to
make
your
portrait
independent
of
you
so
that
you
may
sink
the
original
and
not
hurt
the
picture
no
no
the
merit
of
these
is
the
inveterate
likeness
all
stiff
and
awkward
as
the
originals
and
like
nothing
in
human
nature
besides
sir
oliver
ah
we

honest
fellow
charles

a
genteel
conveyance

i
assure
you
they
were
most
of

used
to
ride
in
their
own
carriages
sir
oliver
i
will
i
will
for
all
but
oliver
charles
ay
all
but
the
little
nabob
sir
oliver
you
fixed
on
that
charles
peremptorily
sir
oliver
aside
a
dear
extravagant
rogue
aloud
good
day
come
aside
let
me
hear
now
who
dares
call
him
profligate
exit
with
moses
careless
why
this
is
the
oddest
genius
of
the
sort
i
ever
met
with
charles
egad
he
the
prince
of
brokers
i
think
i
wonder
how
the
devil
moses
got
acquainted
with
so
honest
a
ha
do
careless
say
i
join
the
company
in
a
few
moments
careless
i
will
but
do
let
that
old
blockhead
persuade
you
to
squander
any
of
that
money
on
old
musty
debts
or
any
such
nonsense
for
tradesmen
charles
are
the
most
exorbitant
fellows
charles
very
true
and
paying
them
is
only
encouraging
them
careless
nothing
else
charles
ay
ay
never
exit
careless
so
this
was
an
odd
old
fellow
indeed
let
me
see
of
these
five
hundred
and
thirty
odd
pounds
are
mine
by
right
fore
heaven
i
find
one
ancestors
are
more
valuable
relations
than
i
took
them
for
ladies
and
gentlemen
your
most
obedient
and
very
grateful
servant
bows
ceremoniously
to
the
pictures
enter
rowley
ha
old
rowley
egad
you
are
just
come
in
time
to
take
leave
of
your
old
acquaintance
rowley
yes
i
heard
they
were
but
i
wonder
you
can
have
such
spirits
under
so
many
distresses
charles
why
there
the
point
my
distresses
are
so
many
that
i
affort
to
part
with
my
spirits
but
i
shall
be
rich
and
splenetic
all
in
good
time
however
i
suppose
you
are
surprised
that
i
am
not
more
sorrowful
at
parting
with
so
many
near
relations
to
be
sure
is
very
affecting
but
you
see
they
never
move
a
muscle
so
why
should
i
rowley
there
no
making
you
serious
a
moment
charles
yes
faith
i
am
so
now
here
my
honest
rowley
here
get
me
this
changed
directly
and
take
a
hundred
pounds
of
it
immediately
to
old
stanley
rowley
a
hundred
pounds
consider
only
charles
gad
life
do
talk
about
it
poor
stanley
wants
are
pressing
and
if
you
do
make
haste
we
shall
have
some
one
call
that
has
a
better
right
to
the
money
rowley
ah
there
the
point
i
never
will
cease
dunning
you
with
the
old
proverb
charles
be
just
before
you
why
so
i
would
if
i
could
but
justice
is
an
old
hobbling
beldame
and
i
ca
get
her
to
keep
pace
with
generosity
for
the
soul
of
me
rowley
yet
charles
believe
me
one
hour
reflection
charles
ay
ay
it
very
true
but
rowley
while
i
have
by
heaven
i
give
so
damn
your
economy
and
now
for
hazard
exeunt
scene
the
parlour
enter
sir
oliver
and
moses
moses
well
sir
i
think
as
sir
peter
said
you
have
seen
charles
in
high
glory
is
great
pity
he
so
extravagant
sir
oliver
true
but
he
would
not
sell
my
picture
moses
and
loves
wine
and
women
so
much
sir
oliver
but
he
would
sell
my
picture
moses
and
game
so
deep
sir
oliver
but
he
would
sell
my
picture
o
here
rowley
enter
rowley
rowley
so
sir
oliver
i
find
you
have
made
a
purchase
sir
oliver
yes
yes
our
young
rake
has
parted
with
his
ancestors
like
old
tapestry
sold
judges
and
generals
by
the
foot
and
maiden
aunts
as
cheap

i
wish
i
may
not
lose
the

the
scrape
i
have
drawn
myself

charles
imprudence

bad

great
points

not
before
you

i
have
a
particular

of
so
curious
a
temper
servant
draws

exit
i
have
a
difficult
hand
to
play
in
this
affair
lady
teazle
as
lately
suspected
my
views
on
maria

she
must
by
no

be
let
into
that
secret
at
least
till
i
have
her
more

lady
teazle
lady

what
sentiment
in
soliloquy
have
you
been
very
impatient
now
o
lud
do
pretend
to
look
grave
i
vow
i
come
before

o
madam
punctuality
is
a
species
of
constancy
a
very
unfashionable
quality
in
a
lady
lady
teazle
upon
my
word
you
ought
to
pity
me
do
you
now
sir
peter
is
grown
so
to
me
of
late
and
so
jealous
of
charles
too
that
the
best
of
the
story
is
it
surface
i
am
glad
my
scandalous
friends
keep
that
up
aside
lady
teazle
i
am
sure
i
wish
he
would
let
maria
marry
him
and
then
perhaps
he
would
be
convinced
do
you
mr
surface
surface
indeed
i
do
aside
o
certainly
i
do
for
then
my
dear
lady
teazle
would
also
be
convinced
how
wrong
her
suspicions
were
of
my
having
any
design
on
the
silly
girl
lady
teazle
well
well
i
inclined
to
believe
you
besides
i
really
never
could
perceive
why
she
should
have
so
any
admirers
surface
o
for
her
fortune
nothing
else
lady
teazle
i
believe
so
for
tho
she
is
certainly
very
pretty
yet
she
has
no
conversation
in
the
world
and
is
so
grave
and
reserved
that
i
declare
i
think
she
have
made
an
excellent
wife
for
sir
surface
so
she
would
lady
teazle
then
one
never
hears
her
speak
ill
of
anybody
which
you
know
is
mighty
dull
surface
yet
she
does
want
understanding
lady
teazle
no
more
she
does
yet
one
is
always
disapointed
when
one
hears
her
speak
for
though
her
eyes
have
no
kind
of
meaning
in
them
she
very
seldom
talks
nonsense
surface
nay
nay
surely
she
has
very
fine
eyes
lady
teazle
why
so
she
has
tho
sometimes
one
fancies
there
a
little
sort
of
a
squint
surface
a
squint
o
fie
lady
teazle
lady
teazle
yes
yes
i
vow
now
come
there
is
a
cupid
in
one
eye
that
the
truth
o
surface
well
his
aim
is
very
direct
however
but
lady
sneerwell
has
quite
corrupted
you
lady
teazle
no
indeed
i
have
not
opinion
enough
of
her
to
be
taught
by
her
and
i
know
that
she
has
lately
rais
many
scandalous
hints
of
me
which
you
know
one
always
hears
from
one
common
friend
or
other
surface
why
to
say
truth
i
believe
you
are
not
more
obliged
to
her
than
others
of
her
acquaintance
lady
teazle
but
is
it
provoking
to
hear
the
most
things
said
to
one
and
there
my
friend
lady
sneerwell
has
circulated
i
do
know
how
many
scandalous
tales
of
me
and
all
without
any
foundation
too
that
what
vexes
me
surface
aye
madam
to
be
sure
that
is
the
provoking
circumstance
without
foundation
yes
yes
there
the
mortification
indeed
for
when
a
slanderous
story
is
believed
against
one
there
certainly
is
no
comfort
like
the
consciousness
of
having
deserved
it
lady
teazle
no
to
be
sure
then
i
forgive
their
malice
but
to
attack
me
who
am
really
so
innocent
and
who
never
say
an
thing
of
anybody
that
is
of
any
friend
and
then
sir
peter
too
to
have
him
so
peevish
and
so
suspicious
when
i
know
the
integrity
of
my
own
heart
indeed
is
monstrous
surface
but
my
dear
lady
teazle
is
your
own
fault
if
you
suffer
it
when
a
husband
entertains
a
groundless
suspicion
of
his
wife
and
withdraws
his
confidence
from
her
the
original
compact
is
broke
and
she
owes
it
to
the
honour
of
her
sex
to
endeavour
to
outwit
him
lady
teazle
indeed
so
that
if
he
suspects
me
without
cause
it
follows
that
the
best
way
of
curing
his
jealousy
is
to
give
him
reason
surface
undoubtedly
for
your
husband
should
never
be
deceived
in
you
and
in
that
case
it
becomes
you
to
be
frail
in
compliment
to
his
discernment
lady
teazle
to
be
sure
what
you
say
is
very
reasonable
and
when
the
consciousness
of
my
own
innocence
surface
ah
my
dear
madam
there
is
the
great
mistake
is
this
very
conscious
innocence
that
is
of
the
greatest
prejudice
to
you
what
is
it
makes
you
negligent
of
forms
and
careless
of
the
world
opinion
why
the
consciousness
of
your
innocence
what
makes
you
thoughtless
in
your
conduct
and
apt
to
run
into
a
thousand
little
imprudences
why
the
consciousness
of
your
innocence
what
makes
you
impatient
of
sir
temper
and
outrageous
at
his
suspicions
why
the
consciousness
of
your
own
innocence
lady
teazle
is
very
true
surface
now
my
dear
lady
teazle
if
you
but
once
make
a
trifling
faux
pas
you
ca
conceive
how
cautious
you
would
grow
and
how
ready
to
humour
and
agree
with
your
husband
lady
teazle
do
you
think
so
surface
o
i
sure
o
and
then
you
find
all
scandal
would
cease
at
once
for
in
short
your
character
at
present
is
like
a
person
in
a
plethora
absolutely
dying
of
too
much
health
lady
teazle
so
so
then
i
perceive
your
prescription
is
that
i
must
sin
in
my
own
defence
and
part
with
my
virtue
to
preserve
my
surface
exactly
so
upon
my
credit
lady
teazle
well
certainly
this
is
the
oddest
doctrine
and
the
newest
receipt
for
avoiding
calumny
surface
an
infallible
one
believe
me
prudence
like
experience
must
be
paid
for
lady
teazle
why
if
my
understanding
were
once
convinced
surface
oh
certainly
madam
your
understanding
should
be
convinced
yes
yes
heaven
forbid
i
should
persuade
you
to
do
anything
you
thought
wrong
no
no
i
have
too
much
honor
to
desire

you
think
we
may

well
leave

argument

ah
the
ill
effects
of
your
country
education
i
see
still
remain
with
you
lady
teazle
i
doubt
they
do
indeed
and
i
will
fairly
own
to
you
that
if
i
could
be
persuaded
to
do
wrong
it
would
be

subject
my

which
i
wish
to
unburthen
my
mind

you
a
point
of
the
greatest
moment
to
my
peace

short
my
good
friend

conduct
of

made
me
very
unhappy

indeed
i
very
sorry
to
hear
it
sir
peter
yes
is
but
too
plain
she
has
not
the
least
regard
for
me
but
what
worse
i
have
pretty
good
authority
to
suspect
that
she
must
have
formed
an
attachment
to
another

indeed
you
astonish
me
sir
peter
yes
and
between
ourselves
i
think
i
have
discover
the
person

how
you
alarm
me
exceedingly
sir
peter
ah
my
dear
friend
i
knew
you
would
sympathize
with
surface
yes
believe
me
sir
peter
such
a
discovery
would
hurt
me
just
as
much
as
it
would
you
sir
peter
i
am
convinced
of
it
ah
it
is
a
happiness
to
have
a
friend
whom
one
can
trust
even
with
one
family
secrets
but
have
you
no
guess
who
i
mean
surface
i
have
the
most
distant
idea
it
ca
be
sir
benjamin
backbite
sir
peter
o
no
what
say
you
to
charles
surface
my
brother
impossible
o
no
sir
peter
you
must
credit
the
scandalous
insinuations
you
hear
no
no
charles
to
be
sure
has
been
charged
with
many
things
but
go
i
can
never
think
he
would
meditate
so
gross
an
injury
sir
peter
ah
my
dear
friend
the
goodness
of
your
own
heart
misleads
you
you
judge
of
others
by
yourself
surface
certainly
sir
peter
the
heart
that
is
conscious
of
its
own
integrity
is
ever
slowest
to
credit
another
sir
peter
true
but
your
brother
has
no
sentiment
you
never
hear
him
talk
surface
well
there
certainly
is
no
knowing
what
men
are
capable
of
no
there
is
no
knowing

i
ca
but
think
lady
teazle

has
too
much
principle
sir
peter
aye
but
what
principle
against
the
flattery
of
a
handsome
lively
young
fellow
surface
that
very
true
sir
peter
and
then
you
know
the
difference
of
our
ages
makes
it
very
improbable
that
she
should
have
any
great
affection
for
me
and
if
she
were
to
be
frail
and
i
were
to
make
it
public
why
the
town
would
only
laugh
at
the
foolish
old
batchelor
who
had
married
a
girl
surface
that
true
to
be
sure
people
would
laugh
sir
peter
laugh
aye
and
make
ballads
and
paragraphs
and
the
devil
knows
what
of
me
surface
no
you
must
never
make
it
public
sir
peter
but
then
again
that
the
nephew
of
my
old
friend
sir
oliver
should
be
the
person
to
attempt
such
an
injury
hurts
me
more
nearly
surface
undoubtedly
when
ingratitude
barbs
the
dart
of
injury
the
wound
has
double
danger
in
it
sir
peter
aye
i
that
was
in
a
manner
left
his
guardian
in
his
house
he
had
been
so
often
entertain
who
never
in
my
life
denied
him
my
advice
surface
o
is
not
to
be
credited
there
may
be
a
man
capable
of
such
baseness
to
be
sure
but
for
my
part
till
you
can
give
me
positive
proofs
you
must
excuse
me
withholding
my
belief
however
if
this
should
be
proved
on
him
he
is
no
longer
a
brother
of
mine
i
disclaim
kindred
with
him
for
the
man
who
can
break
thro
the
laws
of
hospitality
and
attempt
the
wife
of
his
friend
deserves
to
be
branded
as
the
pest
of
society

what
a
difference
there
is
between
you
what
noble
sentiments

i
can
not
suspect

honor
sir

sure
i
wish
to
think
well
of

to
remove
all
ground

quarrel

has
lately
reproach
me
more
than
once
with
having
made
no
settlement

in

last
quarrel

almost
hinted
that
she
should
not
break
her
heart

i
was
now
as
we
seem
to
differ
in
our
ideas

expense

have
resolved
she
shall
be
her
own
mistress

that
respect
for
the
future

if
i
were
to
die
she
shall
find
that

have
not
been
inattentive

living

the
draughts

wish
to
have
your
opinion

will

hundred

live

by
the
other

death

this
conduct

indeed
truly
generous

may
not
corrupt

aside

i
am
determined

shall
have
no
cause

would
not

latter
instance
of

up
at
first
what
have
you
had
a
jew
or
a
wench
with

assure
you
charles
but
what
has
made
sir
peter
steal
off
i
thought
he
had
been
with
you
surface
he
was
brother
but
hearing
you
were
coming
he
did
chuse
to
stay
charles
what
was
the
old
gentleman
afraid
i
wanted
to
borrow
money
of
him
surface
no
sir
but
i
am
sorry
to
find
charles
you
have
lately
given
that
worthy
man
grounds
for
great
uneasiness
charles
yes
they
tell
me
i
do
that
to
a
great
many
worthy
men
but
how
so
pray
surface
to
be
plain
with
you
brother
he
thinks
you
are
endeavouring
to
gain
lady
teazle
affections
from
him
charles
who
i
o
lud
not
i
upon
my
ha
ha
ha
so
the
old
fellow
has
found
out
that
he
has
got
a
young
wife
has
he
or
worse
she
has
discover
that
she
has
an
old
husband

this
is
no
subject
to
jest
on
brother
he
who
can
laugh
charles
true
true
as
you
were
going
to
say
then
seriously
i
never
had
the
least
idea
of
what
you
charge
me
with
upon
my
honour
surface
well
it
will
give
sir
peter
great
satisfaction
to
hear
this
charles
aloud
to
be
sure
i
once
thought
the
lady
seemed
to
have
taken
a
fancy
but
upon
my
soul
i
never
gave
her
the
least
beside
you
know
my
attachment
to
maria
surface
but
sure
brother
even
if
lady
teazle
had
betray
the
fondest
partiality
for
you
charles
why
joseph
i
hope
i
shall
never
deliberately
do
a
dishonourable
action
but
if
a
pretty
woman
was
purposely
to
throw
herself
in
my
way
and
that
pretty
woman
married
to
a
man
old
enough
to
be
her
father
surface
well
charles
why
i
believe
i
should
be
obliged
to
borrow
a
little
of
your
morality
that
but
brother
do
you
know
now
that
you
surprize
me
exceedingly
by
naming
me
with
lady
teazle
for
faith
i
always
understood
you
were
her
favourite
surface
o
for
shame
charles
this
retort
is
foolish
charles

i
swear
i
have
seen
you
exchange
such
significant
glances

nay
nay
sir
this
is
no
jest
charles

one
day
when

must
stop
him

charles

i
beg
your
pardon
but
sir
peter
has
overheard
all
we
have
been

i
believe
i
have
suspected

you

my
plan
charles

sir
peter

i
acquit
you

ill
of
you

lucky
you

more

it
joseph
sir

ah
you
would
have
retorted
on
him
charles
aye
aye
that
was
a
joke
sir
peter
yes
yes

know
his
honor

have
something
to

they

send
this
man
away

out
sir
peter
ah
charles
if
you
associated
more
with
your
brother
one
might
indeed
hope
for
your
reformation
he
is
a
man
of
sentiment
well
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
so
noble
as
a
man
of
sentiment
charles
pshaw
he
is
too
moral
by
half
and
so
apprehensive
of
his
good
name
as
he
calls
it
that
i
suppose
he
would
as
soon
let
a
priest
in
his
house
as
a
girl
sir
peter
no
no
come
come
you
wrong
him
no

joseph

no
rake
but
he
is
no
such
saint
in
that
respect
either
i
have
a
great
mind
to
tell
him
we
should
have
such
a
laugh
charles
oh
hang
him
he
a
very
anchorite
a
young
hermit
sir
peter
harkee
you
must
not
abuse

promise
you
charles
why
you
wo
tell
him
sir
peter
no
but
this
way
egad
i
tell
him
harkee
have
you
a
mind
to
have
a
good
laugh
against
joseph
charles
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
sir
peter
then
we
will
i
be
quit
with
him
for
discovering
he
had
a
girl
with
him
when
i
called

charles
what
joseph
you
jest
sir
peter

a
little
french
milliner

all
that
horrible

of
the
smartest
french
milliners

ever

you
seem
all
to
have

diverting
yourselves

secret

i
beg
your

to
inform
me

will
you
please
to
explain
this
matter

though
i
found
you

dark

you
are
not
so
now
all
mute
well
i
can
make
nothing
of
the
affair

make
no
doubt
but
you
perfectly
understand
one
another

i
leave
you
to
going
brother
i
sorry
to
find
you
have
given
that
worthy
man
grounds
for
so
much
uneasiness
sir
peter
there
nothing
in
the
world
so
noble
as
a
man
of
sentiment
stand
for
some
time
looking
at
one
another
exit
charles
surface
sir
peter
notwithstanding
i
confess
that
appearances
are
against
me
if
you
will
afford
me
your
patience
i
make
no
doubt
but
i
shall
explain
everything
to
your
sir
peter
if
you
please
sir
surface
the
fact
is
sir
that
lady
teazle
knowing
my
pretensions
to
your
ward
maria
i
say
sir
lady
teazle
being
apprehensive
of
the
jealousy
of
your
temper
and
knowing
my
friendship
to
the
family
s
he
sir
i
say
call
here
in
order
that
i
might
explain
those
pretensions
but
on
your
coming
being
apprehensive
as
i
said
of
your
jealousy
she
withdrew
and
this
you
may
depend
o
is
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
sir
peter
a
very
clear
account
upon
the
my
word
and
i
dare
swear
the
lady
will
vouch
for
every
article
of
it
lady
teazle
for
not
one
word
of
it
sir
peter
sir
peter
how
do
you
think
it
worthwhile
to
agree
in
the
lie
lady
teazle
there
is
not
one
syllable
of
truth
in
what
that
gentleman
has
told
you
sir
peter
i
believe
you
upon
my
soul
surface
madam
will
you
betray
me
aside
lady
teazle
good
hypocrite
by
your
leave
i
will
speak
for
myself
sir
peter
aye
let
her
alone
sir
you
find
she
make
out
a
better
story
than
you
without
prompting
lady
teazle
hear
me
sir
peter
i
came
hither
on
no
matter
relating
to
your
ward
and
even
ignorant
of
this
gentleman
pretensions
to
her
but
i
came
seduced
by
his
insidious
arguments
and
pretended
passion
at
least
to
listen
to
his
dishonourable
love
if
not
to
sacrifice
your
honour
to
his
baseness
sir
peter
now
i
believe
the
truth
is
coming
indeed
surface
the
woman
mad
lady
teazle
no
sir
she
has
recovered
her
senses
your
own
arts
have
furnished
her
with
the
means
sir
peter
i
do
not
expect
you
to
credit
me
but
the
tenderness
you
express
for
me
when
i
am
sure
you
could
not
think
i
was
a
witness
to
it
has
penetrated
so
to
my
heart
that
had
i
left
the
place
without
the
shame
of
this
discovery
my
future
life
should
have
spoken
the
sincerity
of
my
gratitude
as
for
that
hypocrite
who
would
have
seduced
the
wife
of
his
too
credulous
friend
while
he
pretended
honourable
addresses
to
his
ward
i
behold
him
now
in
a
light
so
truly
despicable
that
i
shall
never
again
respect
myself
for
having
listened
to
him
exit
surface
notwithstanding
all
this
sir
peter
heaven
knows
sir
peter
that
you
are
a
villain
and
so
i
leave
you
to
your
conscience
surface
you
are
too
rash
sir
peter
you
shall
hear
me
the
man
who
shuts
out
conviction
by
refusing
to
exeunt
surface
following
and
speaking
end
of
the
fourth
act
v
scene
the
library
enter
surface
and
servant
surface
stanley
and
why
should
you
think
i
would
see
him
you
must
know
he
came
to
ask
something
servant
sir
i
should
have
let
him
in
but
that
rowley
came
to
the
door
with
him
surface
pshaw
blockhead
to
suppose
that
i
should
now
be
in
a
temper
to
receive
visits
from
poor
relations
well
why
do
you
show
the
fellow
up
servant
i
will
sir
why
sir
it
was
not
my
fault
that
sir
peter
discover
my
lady
surface
go
fool
exit
servant
sure
fortune
never
play
a
man
of
my
policy
such
a
trick
before
my
character
with
sir
peter
my
hopes
with
maria
destroy
in
a
moment
i
in
a
rare
humour
to
listen
to
other
people
distresses
i
sha
be
able
to
bestow
even
a
benevolent
sentiment
on
stanley
so
here
he
comes
and
rowley
with
him
i
must
try
to
recover
myself
and
put
a
little
charity
into
my
face
exit
enter
sir
oliver
and
rowley
sir
oliver
what
does
he
avoid
us
that
was
he
was
it
not
rowley
it
was
sir
but
i
doubt
you
are
come
a
little
too
abruptly
his
nerves
are
so
weak
that
the
sight
of
a
poor
relation
may
be
too
much
for
him
i
should
have
gone
first
to
break
you
to
him
sir
oliver
a
plague
of
his
nerves
yet
this
is
he
whom
sir
peter
extolls
as
a
man
of
the
most
benevolent
way
of
thinking
rowley
as
to
his
way
of
thinking
i
ca
pretend
to
decide
for
to
do
him
justice
he
appears
to
have
as
much
speculative
benevolence
as
any
private
gentleman
in
the
kingdom
though
he
is
seldom
so
sensual
as
to
indulge
himself
in
the
exercise
of
it
sir
oliver
yet
he
has
a
string
of
charitable
sentiments
i
suppose
at
his
fingers
ends
rowley
or
rather
at
his
tongue
end
sir
oliver
for
i
believe
there
is
no
sentiment
he
has
more
faith
in
than
that
begins
at
home
sir
oliver
and
his
i
presume
is
of
that
domestic
sort
which
never
stirs
abroad
at
all
rowley
i
doubt
you
find
it
so
but
he
coming
i
must
seem
to
interrupt
you
and
you
know
immediately
as
you
leave
him
i
come
in
to
announce
your
arrival
in
your
real
character
sir
oliver
true
and
afterwards
you
meet
me
at
sir
peter
rowley
without
losing
a
moment
exit
sir
oliver
so
i
see
he
has
premeditated
a
denial
by
the
complaisance
of
his
features
enter
surface
surface
sir
i
beg
you
ten
thousand
pardons
for
keeping
you
a
moment
waiting
stanley
i
presume
sir
oliver
at
your
service
surface
sir
i
beg
you
will
do
me
the
honour
to
sit
down
i
entreat
you
sir
sir
oliver
dear
sir
there
no
occasion
too
civil
by
half
surface
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
knowing
you
stanley
but
i
am
extremely
happy
to
see
you
look
so
well
you
were
nearly
related
to
my
mother
i
think
stanley
sir
oliver
i
was
sir
so
nearly
that
my
present
poverty
i
fear
may
do
discredit
to
her
wealthy
children
else
i
should
not
have
presumed
to
trouble
surface
dear
sir
there
needs
no
apology
he
that
is
in
distress
tho
a
stranger
has
a
right
to
claim
kindred
with
the
wealthy
i
am
sure
i
wish
i
was
of
that
class
and
had
it
in
my
power
to
offer
you
even
a
small
relief
sir
oliver
if
your
unkle
sir
oliver
were
here
i
should
have
a
friend
surface
i
wish
he
was
sir
with
all
my
heart
you
should
not
want
an
advocate
with
him
believe
me
sir
sir
oliver
i
should
not
need
one
my
distresses
would
recommend
but
i
imagined
his
bounty
had
enabled
you
to
become
the
agent
of
his
charity
surface
my
dear
sir
you
are
strangely
misinformed
sir
oliver
is
a
worthy
man
a
worthy

a
very
worthy
sort
of
man
but
avarice
stanley
is
the
vice
of
age
i
will
tell
you
my
good
sir
in
confidence
what
he
has
done
for
me
has
been
a
mere
nothing

i
know
have
thought
otherwise

for
my
part
i
never
chose

contradict

report

transmitted

avadavats
and
indian
crackers
surface
then
my
dear
sir
you
have
heard
i
doubt
not
of
the
extravagance
of
my
brother
sir
there
are
very
few
would
credit
what
i
have
done
for
that
unfortunate
young
man
sir
oliver
not
i
for
one
surface
the
sums
i
have
lent
him
indeed
i
have
been
exceedingly
to
blame
it
was
an
amiable
weakness
however
i
do
pretend
to
defend
it
and
now
i
feel
it
doubly
culpable
since
it
has
deprived
me
of
the
power
of
serving
you
stanley
as
my
heart
directs
sir
oliver
dissembler
then
sir
you
can
not
assist
me
surface
at
present
it
grieves
me
to
say
i
can
not
but
whenever
i
have
the
ability
you
may
depend
upon
hearing
from
me
sir
oliver
i
am
extremely
sorry
surface
not
more
than
i
am
believe
me
to
pity
without
the
power
to
relieve
is
still
more
painful
than
to
ask
and
be
denied
sir
oliver
kind
sir
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
surface
you
leave
me
deeply
affected
stanley
william
be
ready
to
open
the
door
sir
oliver
o
dear
sir
no
ceremony
surface
your
very
obedient
sir
oliver
your
most
obsequious
surface
you
may
depend
on
hearing
from
me
whenever
i
can
be
of
service
sir
oliver
sweet
sir
you
are
too
good
surface
in
the
mean
time

grateful
and
perpetual
humble
servant
surface
sir
yours
as
sincerely
sir
oliver
charles
you
are
my
heir
exit
surface
solus
soh
this
is
one
bad
effect
of
a
good
character
it
invites
applications
from
the
unfortunate
and
there
needs
no
small
degree
of
address
to
gain
the
reputation
of
benevolence
without
incurring
the
the
silver
ore
of
pure
charity
is
an
expensive
article
in
the
catalogue
of
a
man
good
qualities
whereas
the
sentimental
french
plate
i
use
instead
of
it
makes
just
as
good
a
shew
and
pays
no
tax
enter
rowley
rowley
mr

was
apprehensive

astonished

why

you

thought
you
had
particular
business
but

appoint
him
here
to
meet
his
uncle
he
will
be
with

quarter
of
an
hour

not
express
the
sensations

purpose
to
discover

i
tell
you
i
have
it
from

candour
and
i
have
it
from
one
sir

who
had
it
from
one
who
had
it
candour
from

immediately
but
here

the
whole
affair
enter

dear
candour
here
a
sad
affair
of
our
friend
teazle
candour
aye
my
dear
friend
who
could
have
thought
it
lady
sneerwell
well
there
is
no
trusting
to
appearances
tho
indeed
she
was
always
too
lively
for
me
candour
to
be
sure
her
manners
were
a
little
too
free
but
she
was
very
young
lady
sneerwell
and
had
indeed
some
good
qualities
candour
so
she
had
indeed
but
have
you
heard
the
particulars
lady
sneerwell
no
but
everybody
says
that
mr
surface
sir
benjamin
aye
there
i
told
you
mr
surface
was
the
man
candour
no
no
indeed
the
assignation
was
with
charles
lady
sneerwell
with
charles
you
alarm
me
candour
candour
yes
yes

the
lover

only
the
informer

but
be

i
hope

i
did
hear

word
of
their
fighting
lady

ungrateful
fellow
and
old
as
i
am
sir
says
he
insist
on
immediate
satisfaction
candour
aye
that
must
have
been
to
charles
for
is
very
unlikely
mr
surface
should
go
to
fight
in
his
own
house
sir
benjamin
gad
life
not
at
all
giving
me
immediate
satisfaction
on
this
madam
lady
teazle
seeing
sir
peter
in
such
danger
ran
out
of
the
room
in
strong
hysterics
and
charles
after
her
calling
out
for
hartshorn
and
water
then
madam
they
began
to
fight
with
swords
enter
crabtree
crabtree
with
pistols
nephew
i
have
it
from
undoubted
authority
candour
oh
crabtree
then
it
is
all
true
crabtree
too
true
indeed
and
sir
peter
dangerously
wounded
sir
benjamin
by
a
thrust
in
second
quite
thro
his
left
side
crabtree
by
a
bullet
lodged
in
the
thorax
candour
mercy
on
me
poor
sir
peter
crabtree
yes
tho
charles
would
have
avoided
the
matter
if
he
could
candour
i
knew
charles
was
the
person
sir
benjamin
o
my
unkle
i
see
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
crabtree
but
sir
peter
tax
him
with
the
basest
ingratitude
sir
benjamin
that
i
told
you
you
know
crabtree
do
nephew
let
me
speak
and
insisted
on
immediate
sir
benjamin
just
as
i
said
crabtree
odds
life
nephew
allow
others
to
know
something
too
a
pair
of
pistols
lay
on
the
bureau
for
mr
surface
it
seems
had
come
home
the
night
before
late
from
where
he
had
been
to
see
the
montem
with
a
friend
who
has
a
son
at
eton
so
unluckily
the
pistols
were
left
charged
sir
benjamin
i
heard
nothing
of
this
crabtree
sir
peter
forced
charles
to
take
one
and
they
fired
it
seems
pretty
nearly
together
charles
shot
took
place
as
i
tell
you
and
sir
peter
miss
but
what
is
very
extraordinary
the
ball
struck
against
a
little
bronze
pliny
that
stood
over
the
fire
place
grazed
out
of
the
window
at
a
right
angle
and
wounded
the
postman
who
was
just
coming
to
the
door
with
a
double
letter
from
northamptonshire
sir
benjamin
my
unkle
account
is
more
circumstantial
i
must
confess
but
i
believe
mine
is
the
true
one
for
all
that
lady
sneerwell
i
am
more
interested
in
this
affair
than
they
imagine
and
must
have
better
exit
sir
benjamin
ah
lady
sneerwell
alarm
is
very
easily
accounted
crabtree
yes
yes
they
certainly
do
say
but
that
neither
here
nor
there
candour
but
pray
where
is
sir
peter
at
present
crabtree
oh
they
brought
him
home
and
he
is
now
in
the
house
the
servants
are
order
to
deny
it
candour
i
believe
so
and
lady
teazle
i
suppose
attending
him
crabtree
yes
yes
and
i
saw
one
of
the
faculty
enter
just
before
me
sir
benjamin
hey
who
comes
here
crabtree
oh
this
is
he
the
physician
depend
o
candour
o
certainly
it
must
be
the
physician
and
now
we
shall
know
enter
sir
oliver
crabtree
well
doctor
what
hopes
candour
aye
doctor
how
your
patient
sir
benjamin
now

a
wound
with
a
small
sword

the
thorax
for
a
hundred
sir
oliver

wound
with
a
small
sword
and
a
bullet
in
the
thorax
oon
are

sir
you
are
not
a
doctor
sir
oliver
truly
sir
i
am
to
thank
you
for
my
degree
if
i
am
crabtree
only
a
friend
of
sir
peter
then
i
presume
but
sir
you
must
have
heard
of
this
accident
sir
oliver
not
a
word
crabtree
not
of
his
being
dangerously
wounded
sir
oliver
the
devil

is
sir
benjamin
run
thro
the
body
crabtree
shot
in
the
breast

benjamin
by
one
mr
surface
crabtree
aye
the
younger
sir
oliver
hey
what
the
plague
you
seem
to
differ
strangely
in
your
accounts
however
you
agree
that
sir
peter
is
dangerously
wounded
sir
benjamin
oh
yes
we
agree
in
that
crabtree
yes
yes
i
believe
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
that
sir
oliver
then
upon
my
word
for
a
person
in
that
situation
he
is
the
most
imprudent
man
alive

comes
walking

at
all
was
the
matter

peter
a
small
sword

physic
and

accomplice

all
this
sir

on
the
occasion

her
advocate

a
hypocritical
villain
sir
oliver
aye
and
that
rogue
charles
to
pull
sir
peter
out
of
the
closet
ha
ha
sir
peter
ha
ha
was
devilish
entertaining
to
be
sure
sir
oliver
ha
ha
egad
sir
peter
i
should
like
to
have
seen
your
face
when
the
screen

face
when
the
screen
was
thrown
down

upon
my
soul
i
ca
help

sir
peter
o

never
look
mankind
in
the
face
again
rowley
without
affectation
sir
peter
you
may
despise
the
ridicule
of
fools
but
i
see
lady
teazle
going
towards
the
next
room
i
am
sure
you
must
desire
a
reconciliation
as
earnestly
as
she
does
sir
oliver
perhaps
my
being
here
prevents
her
coming
to
you
well
leave
honest
rowley
to
mediate
between
you
but
he
must
bring
you
all
presently
to
mr
surface
where
i
am
now
returning
if
not
to
reclaim
a
libertine
at
least
to
expose
hypocrisy
sir
peter
ah
i
be
present
at
your
discovering
yourself
there
with
all
my
heart
though
is
a
vile
unlucky
place
for
discoveries
sir
oliver
however
it
is
very
convenient
to
the
carrying
on
of
my
plot
that
you
all
live
so
near

is
not
coming
here
you
see
rowley
rowley
no
but
she
has
left
the
door
of
that
room
open
you
see
she
is
in
tears
sir
peter
she
seems
indeed
to
wish
i
should
go
to
how
dejected
she
appears
rowley
and
will
you
refrain
from
comforting
her
sir
peter
certainly
a
little
mortification
appears
very
becoming
in
a
wife
do
you
think
it
will
do
her
good
to
let
her
pine
a
little
rowley
o
this
is
ungenerous
in
you
sir
peter
well
i
know
not
what
to
think
you
remember
rowley
the
letter
i
found
of
her
evidently
intended
for
charles
rowley
a
mere
forgery
sir
peter
laid
in
your
way
on
purpose
this
is
one
of
the
points
which
i
intend
snake
shall
give
you
conviction
on
sir
peter
i
wish
i
were
once
satisfied
of
that
she
looks
this
way
what
a
remarkably
elegant
turn
of
the
head
she
has
rowley
go
to
her
rowley
certainly
sir
peter
tho
when
it
is
known
that
we
are
reconciled
people
will
laugh
at
me
ten
times
more
rowley
let
them
laugh
and
retort
their
malice
only
by
showing
them
you
are
happy
in
spite
of
it
sir
peter
efaith
so
i
will
and
if
i
not
mistaken
we
may
yet
be
the
happiest
couple
in
the
country
rowley
nay
sir
peter
he
who
once
lays
aside
suspicion
sir
peter
hold
master
rowley
if
you
have
any
regard
for
me
never
let
me
hear
you
utter
anything
like
a
sentiment
i
have
had
enough
of
them
to
serve
me
the
rest
of
my
life
exeunt
scene
the
the
library
surface
and
lady
sneerwell
lady
sneerwell
impossible
will
not
sir
peter
immediately
be
reconciled
to
charles
and
of
consequence
no
longer
oppose
his
union
with
maria
the
thought
is
distraction
to
me
surface
can
passion
furnish
a
remedy
lady
sneerwell
no
nor
cunning
either
o
i
was
a
fool
an
ideot
to
league
with
such
a
blunderer
surface
surely
lady
sneerwell
i
am
the
greatest
sufferer
yet
you
see
i
bear
the
accident
with
calmness
lady
sneerwell
because
the
disappointment
has
reached
your
heart
your
interest
only
attached
you
to
maria
had
you
felt
for
her
what
i
have
for
that
ungrateful
libertine
neither
your
temper
nor
hypocrisy
could
prevent
your
showing
the
sharpness
of
your
vexation
surface
but
why
should
your
reproaches
fall
on
me
for
this
disappointment
lady
sneerwell
are
not
you
the
cause
of
it
what
had
you
to
bate
in
your
pursuit
of
maria
to
pervert
lady
teazle
by
the
had
you
not
a
sufficient
field
for
your
roguery
in
blinding
sir
peter
and
supplanting
your
brother
i
hate
such
an
avarice
of
crimes
is
an
unfair
monopoly
and
never
prospers
surface
well
i
admit
i
have
been
to
blame
i
confess
i
deviated
from
the
direct
road
of
wrong
but
i
do
think
we
so
totally
defeated
neither
lady
sneerwell
no
surface
you
tell
me
you
have
made
a
trial
of
snake
since
we
met
and
that
you
still
believe
him
faithful
to
us
lady
sneerwell
i
do
believe
so
surface
and
that
he
has
undertaken
should
it
be
necessary
to
swear
and
prove
that
charles
is
at
this
time
contracted
by
vows
and
honour
to
your
ladyship
which
some
of
his
former
letters
to
you
will
serve
to
support
lady
sneerwell
this
indeed
might
have
assisted
surface
come
come
it
is
not
too
late
yet
but
hark
this
is
probably
my
unkle
sir
oliver
retire
to
that
room
we
consult
further
when
he
lady
sneerwell
well
but
if
he
should
find
you
out
to
surface
o
i
have
no
fear
of
that
sir
peter
will
hold
his
tongue
for
his
own
credit
sake
and
you
may
depend
o
i
shall
soon
discover
sir
oliver
weak
side
lady
sneerwell
i
have
no
diffidence
of
your
abilities
only
be
constant
to
one
roguery
at
a
time
exit
surface
i
will
i
will
so
is
confounded
hard
after
such
bad
fortune
to
be
baited
by
one
confederate
in
evil
well
at
all
events
my
character
is
so
much
better
than
charles

i
certainly
hey

a
hundred

b
at
the

surface
here
sir

at

sir
oliver
gentlemen
surface
sir
by
heaven
you

this

both
forcing
sir

out

peter
my
old
friend
sir

hey
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
here
are
dutiful
nephews
assault
their
unkle
at
his
first
visit
lady
teazle
indeed
sir
oliver
was
well
we
came
in
to
rescue
you
rowley
truly
it
was
for
i
perceive
sir
oliver
the
character
of
old
stanley
was
no
protection
to
you
sir
oliver
nor
of
premium
either
the
necessities
of
the
former
could
not
extort
a
shilling
from
that
benevolent
gentleman
and
with
the
other
i
stood
a
chance
of
faring
worse
than
my
ancestors
and
being
knocked
down
without
being
bid
for
surface
charles
charles
joseph
surface
is
compleat
charles
very
sir
oliver
sir
peter
my
friend
and
rowley
too
look
on
that
elder
nephew
of
mine
you
know
what
he
has
already
received
from
my
bounty
and
you
know
also
how
gladly
i
would
have
look
on
half
my
fortune
as
held
in
trust
for
him
judge
then
my
disappointment
in
discovering
him
to
be
destitute
of
truth
charity
and
gratitude
sir
peter
sir
oliver
i
should
be
more
surprized
at
this
declaration
if
i
had
not
myself
found
him
to
be
selfish
treacherous
and
hypocritical
lady
teazle
and
if
the
gentleman
pleads
not
guilty
to
these
pray
let
him
call
me
to
his
character
sir
peter
then
i
believe
we
need
add
no
more
if
he
knows
himself
he
will
consider
it
as
the
most
perfect
punishment
that
he
is
known
to
the
world
charles
if
they
talk
this
way
to
honesty
what
will
they
say
to
me
by
and
bye
sir
oliver
as
for
that
prodigal
his
brother
there
charles
aye
now
comes
my
turn
the
damn
family
pictures
will
ruin
me
surface
sir
oliver
unkle
will
you
honour
me
with
a
hearing
charles
i
wish
joseph
now
would
make
one
of
his
long
speeches
and
i
might
recollect
myself
a
little
sir
oliver
and
i
suppose
you
would
undertake
to
vindicate
yourself
entirely
surface
i
trust
i
could
sir
oliver
nay
if
you
desert
your
roguery
in
its
distress
and
try
to
be
justified
you
have
even
less
principle
than
i
thought
you
to
charles
surface
well
sir
and
you
could
justify
yourself
too
i
suppose
charles
not
that
i
know
of
sir
oliver
sir
oliver
what
little
premium
has
been
let
too
much
into
the
secret
i
presume
charles
true
sir
but
they
were
family
secrets
and
should
not
be
mentioned
again
you
know
rowley
come
sir
oliver
i
know
you
can
not
speak
of
charles
follies
with
anger
sir
oliver
odd
heart
no
more
i
can
nor
with
gravity
either
sir
peter
do
you
know
the
rogue
bargain
with
me
for
all
his
ancestors
sold
me
judges
and
generals
by
the
foot
and
maiden
aunts
as
cheap
as
broken
china
charles
to
be
sure
sir
oliver
i
did
make
a
little
free
with
the
family
canvas
that
the
truth
o
my
ancestors
may
certainly
rise
in
judgment
against
me
there
no
denying
it
but
believe
me
sincere
when
i
tell
you
and
upon
my
soul
i
would
not
say
so
if
i
was
not
that
if
i
do
not
appear
mortified
at
the
exposure
of
my
follies
it
is
because
i
feel
at
this
moment
the
warmest
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
my
liberal
benefactor
sir
oliver
charles
i
believe
you
give
me
your
hand
again
the
little
fellow
over
the
couch
has
made
your
peace
charles
then
sir
my
gratitude
to
the
original
is
still
encreased
lady
teazle
advancing
yet
i
believe
sir
oliver
here
is
one
whom
charles
is
still
more
anxious
to
be
reconciled
to
sir
oliver
o
i
have
heard
of
his
attachment
there
and
with
the
young
lady
pardon
if
i
construe
right
that
blush
sir
peter
well
child
speak
your
sentiments
you
know
we
are
going
to
be
reconciled
to
charles
maria
sir
i
have
little
to
say
but
that
i
shall
rejoice
to
hear
that
he
is
happy
for
me
whatever
claim
i
had
to
his
affection
i
willing
resign
to
one
who
has
a
better
title
charles
how
maria
sir
peter
heyday
what
the
mystery
now
while
he
appeared
an
incorrigible
rake
you
would
give
your
hand
to
no
one
else
and
now
that
he
likely
to
reform
i
warrant
you
wo
have
him
maria
his
own
heart
and
lady
sneerwell
know
the
cause
charles
lady
sneerwell
surface
brother
it
is
with
great
concern
i
am
obliged
to
speak
on
this
point
but
my
regard
to
justice
obliges
me
and
lady
injuries
can
no
longer
be
concealed
goes
to

enter
lady
sneerwell
sir
peter
soh
another
french
milliner
egad

in
every
room

suppose
lady
sneerwell
ungrateful
charles
well
may
you
be
surprised
and
feel
for
the
indelicate
situation
which
your
perfidy
has
forced
me
into
charles
pray
unkle
is
this
another
plot
of
yours
for
as
i
have
life
i
do
understand
it
surface
i
believe
sir
there
is
but
the
evidence
of
one
person
more
necessary
to
make
it
extremely
clear
sir
peter
and
that
person
i
imagine
is
snake
rowley
you
were
perfectly
right
to
bring
him
with
us
and
pray
let
him
appear
rowley
walk
in
snake
enter
snake
i
thought
his
testimony
might
be
wanted
however
it
happens
unluckily
that
he
comes
to
confront
lady
sneerwell
and
not
to
support
her
lady
sneerwell
a
villain
treacherous
to
me
at
last
speak
fellow

you
too
conspired
against
me
snake
i
beg
your
ladyship
ten
thousand
pardons
you
paid
me
extremely
liberally
for
the
lie
in

unfortunately

been
double

truth

torments
of
shame
and
disappointment
on
you
all
lady
teazle
hold
lady
sneerwell
before
you
go
let
me
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
and
that
gentleman
have
taken
in
writing
letters
from
me
to
charles
and
answering
them
yourself
and
let
me
also
request
you
to
make
my
respects
to
the
scandalous
college
of
which
you
are
president
and
inform
them
that
lady
teazle
licentiate
begs
leave
to
return
the
diploma
they
granted
her
as
she
leaves
of
f
practice

fifty
years

what
have
you
to
say

sir
i
am
so
confounded
to
find
that

be
guilty
of
suborning
snake
in
this
manner
to
impose
on
us
all
that
i
know
not
what
to
say
however
lest
her
revengeful
spirit
should
prompt
her
to
injure
my
brother
i
had
certainly
better
follow
her
directly
exit
sir
peter

marry
her
joseph
if

beg
pardon
once
for

parties

well
well
you
have
made
atonement

a
good
deed

never
be
known

the
plague

you
ashamed
of
having
done
a
right
thing

i
live
by
the
badness
of
my
character

have
nothing
but
my
infamy
to
depend
on
and
if
it
were
once
known
that
i
had
been
betray
into
an
honest
action
i
should
lose
every
friend

have
in
the
world

not
traduce
you
by
saying
anything
to
your
praise

precious
rogue

that
fellow
is
a
writer

no
persuasion
now
to
reconcile
your
nephew

should
be
and
egad

owe
you

indeed
charles
rowley
if
my

attempt

you
me
sir
peter
aye
honest
rowley
always
said
you
would
reform
charles
why
as
to
reforming
sir
peter
i
make
no
promises
and
that
i
take
to
be
a
proof
that
i
intend
to
set
about
it
but
here

be
my
monitor

leave

virtuous
path
those
eyes
illumine
tho
thou

i
will
obey

humbled
fugitive

sanctuary

but
love
and
you
you
can
indeed
each
anxious
fear
remove

epilogue
by
colman

by
lady
teazle
i
who
was

so
volatile
and
gay
like
a
must
now
blow
all
one
way
bend
all

weathercock
my

motley
bayes

crying
epilogues

laughing
plays

bath

when

the
nerves

is
my
case

i
must
deplore

gay
dream
of

genius
for
the

bloom

condemn
to
such
a
dismal
doom

money
when
i
just
knew
how
to
waste
it
leave
london
just
as
i
began
to
taste
it
must
i
then
watch
the
early
crowing
cock
the
melancholy
ticking
of
a
clock
in
a
lone
rustic
hall
for
ever
pounded
with
dogs
cats
rats
and
squalling
brats
surrounded
with
humble
curate

i
now
retire
while
good
sir
peter
boozes
with
the
squire
and
at
backgammon
mortify
my
soul
that
pants
for
loo
or
flutters
at
a
vole
seven
the
main
dear
sound
that
must
expire
lost
at
hot
cockles
round
a
christmas

soon
spent
