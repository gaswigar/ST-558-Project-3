edited
with
an
introduction
by

alfred
vizetelly
introduction
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
was
with
respect
to
the
date
of
publication
the
fourth
volume
of
zola
s
series
but
in
the
amended
and
final
scheme
of
that
great
literary
undertaking
it
occupies
the
ninth
place
it
proceeds
from
the
sixth
volume
of
the
series
the
conquest
of
plassans
which
is
followed
by
the
two
works
that
deal
with
the
career
of
octave
mouret
abbe
serge
mouret
s
elder
brother
in
the
conquest
of
plassans
serge
and
his
sister
desiree
are
seen
in
childhood
at
their
home
in
plassans
which
is
wrecked
by
the
doings
of
a
certain
abbe
faujas
and
his
relatives
serge
mouret
grows
up
is
called
by
an
instinctive
vocation
to
the
priesthood
and
becomes
parish
priest
of
les
artaud
a
pagan
hamlet
in
one
of
those
bare
burning
stretches
of
country
with
which
provence
abounds
and
here
it
is
that
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
opens
in
the
old
ruinous
church
perched
upon
a
hillock
in
full
view
of
the
squalid
village
the
arid
fields
and
the
great
belts
of
rock
which
shut
in
the
landscape
all
around
there
are
two
elements
in
this
remarkable
story
which
from
the
standpoint
of
literary
style
has
never
been
excelled
by
anything
that
zola
has
since
written
and
one
may
glance
at
it
therefore
from
two
points
of
view
taking
it
under
its
sociological
and
religious
aspect
it
will
be
found
to
be
an
indirect
indictment
of
the
celibacy
of
the
priesthood
that
celibacy
contrary
to
nature
s
fundamental
law
which
assuredly
has
largely
influenced
the
destinies
of
the
roman
catholic
church
to
that
celibacy
and
to
all
the
evils
that
have
sprang
from
it
may
be
ascribed
much
of
the
irreligion
current
in
france
the
periodical
reports
on
criminality
issued
by
the
french
ministers
of
justice
since
the
foundation
of
the
republic
in
supply
materials
for
a
most
formidable
indictment
of
that
vow
of
perpetual
chastity
which
rome
exacts
from
her
clergy
nowadays
it
is
undoubtedly
too
late
for
rome
to
go
back
upon
that
vow
and
thereby
transform
the
whole
of
her
sacerdotal
organisation
but
perhaps
had
she
done
so
in
past
times
before
the
spirit
of
inquiry
and
free
examination
came
into
being
she
might
have
assured
herself
many
more
centuries
of
supremacy
than
have
fallen
to
her
lot
but
she
has
ever
sought
to
dissociate
the
law
of
the
divinity
from
the
law
of
nature
as
though
indeed
the
latter
were
but
the
invention
of
the
fiend
abbe
mouret
zola
s
hero
finds
himself
placed
between
the
law
of
the
divinity
and
the
law
of
nature
and
the
struggle
waged
within
him
by
those
two
forces
is
a
terrible
one
that
which
training
has
implanted
in
his
mind
proves
the
stronger
and
so
far
as
the
canons
of
the
church
can
warrant
it
he
saves
his
soul
but
the
problem
is
not
quite
frankly
put
by
zola
for
if
abbe
mouret
transgresses
he
does
so
unwittingly
at
a
time
when
he
is
unconscious
of
his
priesthood
and
has
no
memory
of
any
vow
when
the
truth
flashes
upon
him
he
is
horrified
with
himself
and
forthwith
returns
to
the
church
a
further
struggle
between
the
contending
forces
then
certainly
ensues
and
ends
in
the
final
victory
of
the
church
but
it
must
at
least
be
said
that
in
the
lapses
which
occur
in
real
life
among
the
roman
priesthood
the
circumstances
are
altogether
different
from
those
which
zola
has
selected
for
his
story
the
truth
is
that
in
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
betwixt
lifelike
glimpses
of
french
rural
life
the
author
transports
us
to
a
realm
of
poesy
and
imagination
this
is
indeed
so
true
that
he
has
introduced
into
his
work
all
the
ideas
on
which
he
had
based
an
early
unfinished
poem
called
he
carries
us
to
an
enchanted
garden
the
paradou
a
name
which
one
need
hardly
say
is
provencal
for
and
there
serge
mouret
on
recovering
from
brain
fever
becomes
as
it
were
a
new
adam
by
the
side
of
a
new
eve
the
fair
and
winsome
albine
all
this
part
of
the
book
then
is
poetry
in
prose
the
author
has
remembered
the
ties
which
link
rousseau
to
the
realistic
school
of
fiction
and
as
in
the
pages
of
trees
springs
mountains
rocks
and
flowers
become
animated
beings
and
claim
their
place
in
the
world
s
mechanism
one
may
indeed
go
back
far
beyond
rousseau
even
to
lucretius
himself
for
more
than
once
we
are
irresistibly
reminded
of
lucretian
scenes
above
which
through
zola
s
pages
there
seems
to
hover
the
pronouncement
of
sophocles
no
ordinance
of
man
shall
override
the
settled
laws
of
nature
and
of
god
not
written
these
in
pages
of
a
book
nor
were
they
framed
nor
yesterday
we
know
not
whence
they
are
but
this
we
know
that
they
from
all
eternity
have
been
and
shall
to
all
eternity
endure
there
is
a
village
called
paradou
in
provence
between
les
baux
and
arles
and
if
we
pass
to
the
young
pair
whose
duo
of
love
is
sung
amidst
the
varied
voices
of
creation
we
are
irresistibly
reminded
of
the
paul
and
virginia
of
pierre
and
the
daphnis
and
chloe
of
longus
beside
them
in
their
marvellous
garden
lingers
a
memory
too
of
manon
and
des
grieux
with
a
suggestion
of
lauzun
and
a
glimpse
of
the
art
of
fragonard
all
combine
all
contribute
from
the
great
classics
to
the
eighteenth
century
to
build
up
a
story
of
love
s
rise
in
the
human
breast
in
answer
to
nature
s
promptings
zola
wrote
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
one
summer
under
the
trees
of
his
garden
mindful
the
while
of
gardens
that
he
had
known
in
childhood
the
flowery
expanse
which
had
stretched
before
his
grandmother
s
home
at
and
the
wild
estate
of
galice
between
roquefavour
and
through
which
he
had
roamed
as
a
lad
with
friends
then
boys
like
himself
professor
baille
and
cezanne
the
painter
and
into
his
description
of
the
wondrous
paradou
he
has
put
all
his
remembrance
of
the
gardens
and
woods
of
provence
where
many
a
plant
and
flower
thrive
with
a
luxuriance
unknown
to
england
true
in
order
to
refresh
his
memory
and
avoid
mistakes
he
consulted
various
horticultural
manuals
whilst
he
was
writing
of
which
circumstance
captious
critics
have
readily
laid
hold
to
proclaim
that
the
description
of
the
paradou
is
a
mere
florist
s
catalogue
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
the
florist
who
might
dare
to
offer
such
a
catalogue
to
the
public
would
be
speedily
assailed
by
all
the
horticultural
journalists
of
england
and
all
the
customers
of
villadom
for
zola
avails
himself
of
a
poet
s
license
to
crowd
marvel
upon
marvel
to
exaggerate
nature
s
forces
to
transform
the
tiniest
blooms
into
giant
examples
of
efflorescence
and
to
mingle
even
the
seasons
one
with
the
other
but
all
this
was
premeditated
there
was
a
picture
before
his
mind
s
eye
and
that
picture
he
sought
to
trace
with
his
pen
regardless
of
all
possible
objections
it
is
the
poet
s
privilege
to
do
this
and
even
to
be
admired
for
it
it
would
be
easy
for
some
leaned
botanist
some
expert
zoologist
to
demolish
milton
from
the
standpoint
of
their
respective
sciences
but
it
would
be
absurd
to
do
so
we
ask
of
the
poet
the
flowers
of
his
imagination
and
the
further
he
carries
us
from
the
sordid
realities
the
limited
possibilities
of
life
the
more
are
we
grateful
to
him
and
zola
s
paradou
is
a
flight
of
fancy
even
as
its
mistress
the
fair
loving
guileless
albine
whose
smiles
and
whose
tears
alike
go
to
our
hearts
is
the
daughter
of
imagination
she
is
a
flower
the
very
flower
of
life
s
youth
in
the
midst
of
all
the
blossoms
of
her
garden
she
unfolds
to
life
and
to
love
even
as
they
unfold
she
loves
rapturously
even
as
they
do
under
the
sun
and
the
azure
and
she
dies
with
them
when
the
sun
s
caress
is
gone
and
the
chill
of
winter
has
fallen
at
the
thought
of
her
one
instinctively
remembers
malherbe
s
ode
a
du
perrier
she
to
this
earth
belonged
where
beauty
fast
to
direst
fate
is
borne
a
rose
she
lasted
as
the
roses
last
only
for
one
brief
morn
french
painters
have
made
subjects
of
many
episodes
in
zola
s
works
but
none
has
been
more
popular
with
them
than
albine
s
pathetic
perfumed
death
amidst
the
flowers
i
know
several
paintings
of
great
merit
which
that
touching
incident
has
inspired
albine
if
more
or
less
unreal
a
phantasm
the
spirit
as
it
were
of
nature
incarnate
in
womanhood
is
none
the
less
the
most
delightful
of
zola
s
heroines
she
smiles
at
us
like
the
vision
of
perfect
beauty
and
perfect
love
which
rises
before
us
when
our
hearts
are
yet
young
and
full
of
illusions
she
is
the
ideal
the
very
quintessence
of
woman
in
serge
mouret
her
lover
we
find
a
man
who
in
more
than
one
respect
recalls
zola
s
later
hero
the
abbe
froment
of
lourdes
and
he
has
the
same
loving
yearning
nature
he
is
born
absolutely
like
abbe
froment
of
an
unbelieving
father
and
a
mother
of
mystical
mind
but
unlike
froment
he
can
not
shake
off
the
shackles
of
his
priesthood
reborn
to
life
after
his
dangerous
illness
he
relapses
into
the
religion
of
death
the
religion
which
regards
life
as
impurity
which
denies
nature
s
laws
and
so
often
wrecks
human
existence
as
if
indeed
that
had
been
the
divine
purpose
in
setting
man
upon
earth
his
struggles
suggest
various
passages
in
lourdes
and
in
fact
in
writing
those
works
zola
must
have
had
his
earlier
creation
in
mind
there
are
passages
in
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
culled
from
the
writings
of
the
spanish
jesuit
fathers
and
the
imitation
of
thomas
a
kempis
that
recur
almost
word
for
word
in
the
trilogy
of
the
three
cities
some
might
regard
this
as
evidence
of
the
limitation
of
zola
s
powers
but
i
think
differently
i
consider
that
he
has
in
both
instances
designedly
taken
the
same
type
of
priest
in
order
to
show
how
he
may
live
under
varied
circumstances
for
in
the
earlier
instance
he
has
led
him
to
one
goal
and
in
the
later
one
to
another
and
the
passages
of
prayer
entreaty
and
spiritual
conflict
simply
recur
because
they
are
germane
even
necessary
to
the
subject
in
both
cases
of
the
minor
characters
that
figure
in
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
the
chief
thing
to
be
said
is
that
they
are
lifelike
if
serge
is
almost
wholly
spiritual
if
albine
is
the
daughter
of
poesy
they
the
others
are
of
the
earth
earthy
as
a
result
of
their
appearance
on
the
scene
there
are
some
powerful
contrasting
passages
in
the
book
archangias
the
coarse
and
brutal
christian
brother
who
serves
as
a
foil
to
abbe
mouret
la
teuse
the
priest
s
garrulous
old
housekeeper
desiree
his
innocent
sister
a
grown
woman
with
the
mind
of
a
child
and
an
almost
crazy
affection
for
every
kind
of
bird
and
beast
are
all
admirably
portrayed
old
bambousse
though
one
sees
but
little
of
him
stands
out
as
a
genuine
type
of
the
french
peasant
who
invariably
places
pecuniary
considerations
before
all
others
and
fortune
and
rosalie
vincent
and
catherine
and
their
companions
are
equally
true
to
nature
it
need
hardly
be
said
that
there
is
many
a
village
in
france
similar
to
les
artaud
that
hamlet
s
shameless
purely
animal
life
has
in
no
wise
been
by
zola
those
who
might
doubt
him
need
not
go
as
far
as
provence
to
find
such
communities
many
norman
hamlets
are
every
whit
as
bad
and
in
normandy
conditions
are
aggravated
by
a
marked
predilection
for
the
bottle
which
as
french
have
been
pointing
out
for
some
years
now
is
fast
hastening
the
degenerescence
of
the
peasantry
both
morally
and
physically
with
reference
to
the
english
version
of
la
faute
de
l
abbe
mouret
herewith
presented
i
may
just
say
that
i
have
subjected
it
to
considerable
revision
and
have
retranslated
all
the
more
important
passages
myself
merton
surrey
abbe
mouret
s
transgression
book
i
i
as
la
teuse
entered
the
church
she
rested
her
broom
and
against
the
altar
she
was
late
as
she
had
that
day
began
her
limping
more
than
ever
in
her
haste
and
hustling
the
benches
she
went
down
the
church
to
ring
the
the
bare
worn
dangled
from
the
ceiling
near
the
confessional
and
ended
in
a
big
knot
greasy
from
handling
again
and
again
with
regular
jumps
she
hung
herself
upon
it
and
then
let
her
whole
bulky
figure
go
with
it
whirling
in
her
petticoats
her
cap
awry
and
her
blood
rushing
to
her
broad
face
having
set
her
cap
straight
with
a
little
pat
she
came
back
breathless
to
give
a
hasty
sweep
before
the
altar
every
day
the
dust
persistently
settled
between
the
disjoined
boards
of
the
platform
her
broom
rummaged
among
the
corners
with
an
angry
rumble
then
she
lifted
the
altar
cover
and
was
sorely
vexed
to
find
that
the
large
upper
cloth
already
darned
in
a
score
of
places
was
again
worn
through
in
the
very
middle
so
as
to
show
the
under
cloth
which
in
its
turn
was
so
worn
and
so
transparent
that
one
could
see
the
consecrated
stone
embedded
in
the
painted
wood
of
the
altar
la
teuse
dusted
the
linen
yellow
from
long
usage
and
plied
her
along
the
shelf
against
which
she
set
the
liturgical
then
climbing
upon
a
chair
she
removed
the
yellow
cotton
covers
from
the
crucifix
and
two
of
the
candlesticks
the
brass
of
the
latter
was
tarnished
dear
me
she
muttered
they
really
want
a
clean
i
must
give
them
a
polish
up
then
hopping
on
one
leg
swaying
and
stumping
heavily
enough
to
drive
in
the
flagstones
she
hastened
to
the
sacristy
for
the
missal
which
she
placed
unopened
on
the
lectern
on
the
epistle
side
with
its
edges
turned
towards
the
middle
of
the
altar
and
afterwards
she
lighted
the
two
candles
as
she
went
off
with
her
broom
she
gave
a
glance
round
her
to
make
sure
that
the
abode
of
the
divinity
had
been
put
in
proper
order
all
was
still
save
that
the
near
the
confessional
still
swung
between
roof
and
floor
with
a
sinuous
sweep
abbe
mouret
had
just
come
down
to
the
sacristy
a
small
and
chilly
apartment
which
a
passage
separated
from
his
good
morning
monsieur
le
cure
said
la
teuse
laying
her
broom
aside
oh
you
have
been
lazy
this
morning
do
you
know
it
s
a
quarter
past
six
and
without
allowing
the
smiling
young
priest
sufficient
time
to
reply
she
added
i
ve
a
scolding
to
give
you
there
s
another
hole
in
the
cloth
again
there
s
no
sense
in
it
we
have
only
one
other
and
i
ve
been
ruining
my
eyes
over
it
these
three
days
in
trying
to
mend
it
you
will
leave
our
poor
lord
quite
bare
if
you
go
on
like
abbe
mouret
was
still
smiling
jesus
does
not
need
so
much
linen
my
good
teuse
he
cheerfully
replied
he
is
always
warm
always
royally
received
by
those
who
love
him
then
stepping
towards
a
small
tap
he
asked
is
my
sister
up
yet
i
have
not
seen
oh
mademoiselle
desiree
has
been
down
a
long
time
answered
the
servant
who
was
kneeling
before
an
old
kitchen
sideboard
in
which
the
sacred
vestments
were
kept
she
is
already
with
her
fowls
and
rabbits
she
was
expecting
some
chicks
to
be
hatched
yesterday
and
it
didn
t
come
off
so
you
can
guess
her
then
the
worthy
woman
broke
off
to
inquire
the
gold
chasuble
eh
the
priest
who
had
washed
his
hands
and
stood
reverently
murmuring
a
prayer
nodded
affirmatively
the
parish
possessed
only
three
chasubles
a
violet
one
a
black
one
and
one
in
the
last
had
to
be
used
on
the
days
when
white
red
or
green
was
prescribed
by
the
ritual
and
it
was
therefore
an
all
important
garment
la
teuse
lifted
it
reverently
from
the
shelf
covered
with
blue
paper
on
which
she
laid
it
after
each
service
and
having
placed
it
on
the
sideboard
she
cautiously
removed
the
fine
cloths
which
protected
its
embroidery
a
golden
lamb
slumbered
on
a
golden
cross
surrounded
by
broad
rays
of
gold
the
gold
tissue
frayed
at
the
folds
broke
out
in
little
slender
tufts
the
embossed
ornaments
were
getting
tarnished
and
worn
there
was
perpetual
anxiety
fluttering
concern
at
seeing
it
thus
go
off
spangle
by
spangle
the
priest
had
to
wear
it
almost
every
day
and
how
on
earth
could
it
be
replaced
how
would
they
be
able
to
buy
the
three
chasubles
whose
place
it
took
when
the
last
gold
threads
should
be
worn
out
upon
the
chasuble
la
teuse
next
laid
out
the
stole
the
maniple
the
girdle
alb
and
amice
but
her
tongue
still
wagged
while
she
crossed
the
stole
with
the
maniple
and
wreathed
the
girdle
so
as
to
trace
the
venerated
initial
of
mary
s
holy
name
that
girdle
is
not
up
to
much
now
she
muttered
you
will
have
to
make
up
your
mind
to
get
another
your
reverence
it
wouldn
t
be
very
hard
i
could
plait
you
one
myself
if
i
only
had
some
abbe
mouret
made
no
answer
he
was
dressing
the
chalice
at
a
small
table
a
large
old
chalice
it
was
with
a
bronze
base
which
he
had
just
taken
from
the
bottom
of
a
deal
cupboard
in
which
the
sacred
vessels
and
linen
the
holy
oils
the
missals
candlesticks
and
crosses
were
kept
across
the
cup
he
laid
a
clean
purificator
and
on
this
set
the
paten
with
the
host
in
it
which
he
covered
with
a
small
lawn
pall
as
he
was
hiding
the
chalice
by
gathering
together
the
folds
in
the
veil
of
cloth
of
gold
matching
the
chasuble
la
teuse
exclaimed
stop
there
s
no
corporal
in
the
burse
last
night
i
took
all
the
dirty
purificators
palls
and
corporals
to
wash
them
separately
of
course
not
with
the
your
reverence
i
didn
t
tell
you
i
have
just
started
the
a
fine
fat
one
it
will
be
better
than
the
then
while
the
priest
slipped
a
corporal
into
the
burse
and
laid
the
latter
on
the
veil
she
went
on
quickly
i
forgot
that
gadabout
vincent
hasn
t
come
do
you
wish
me
to
serve
your
mass
your
reverence
the
young
priest
eyed
her
sternly
well
it
isn
t
a
sin
she
continued
with
her
genial
smile
i
did
serve
a
mass
once
in
monsieur
caffin
s
time
i
serve
it
better
too
than
ragamuffins
who
laugh
like
heathens
at
seeing
a
fly
buzzing
about
the
church
true
i
may
wear
a
cap
i
may
be
sixty
years
old
and
as
round
as
a
tub
but
i
have
more
respect
for
our
lord
than
those
imps
of
boys
whom
i
caught
only
the
other
day
playing
at
behind
the
the
priest
was
still
looking
at
her
and
shaking
his
head
what
a
hole
this
village
is
she
grumbled
not
a
hundred
and
fifty
people
in
it
there
are
days
like
when
you
wouldn
t
find
a
living
soul
in

even
the
babies
in
swaddling
clothes
are
gone
to
the
vineyards
and
goodness
knows
what
they
do
among
such
vines
vines
that
grow
under
the
pebbles
and
look
as
dry
as
thistles
a
perfect
wilderness
three
miles
from
any
highway
unless
an
angel
comes
down
to

just
at
that
moment
however
vincent

brichets

gently
opened
the
door
of
the
sacristy
his
shock
of
red
hair
and
his
little
glistening
grey
eyes
exasperated
la
teuse
oh
the
wretch

cried
i

just
been
up
to
some
mischief

on

since
his
reverence
is
afraid
i
might
dirty
our
lord
on
seeing
the
lad
abbe
mouret
had
taken
up
the
amice
he
kissed
the
cross
embroidered
in
the
centre
of
it
and
for
a
second
laid
the
cloth
upon
his
head
then
lowering
it
over
the
of
his
cassock
he
crossed
it
and
fastened
the
tapes
the
right
one
over
the
left
he
next
donned
the
alb
the
symbol
of
purity
beginning
with
the
right
sleeve
vincent
stooped
and
turned
around
him
adjusting
the
alb
in
order
that
it
should
fall
evenly
all
round
him
to
a
couple
of
inches
from
the
ground
then
he
presented
the
girdle
to
the
priest
who
fastened
it
tightly
round
his
loins
as
a
reminder
of
the
bonds
wherewith
the
saviour
was
bound
in
his
passion
la
teuse
remained
standing
there
feeling
jealous
and
hurt
and
struggling
to
keep
silence
but
so
great
was
the
itching
of
her
tongue
that
she
soon
broke
out

him
i
believe
he
has
got
something
to
say
to

silenced
her
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
then
he
repeated
the
usual
prayers
while
he
took
the
maniple
which
he
kissed
before
slipping
it
over
his
left
forearm
as
a
symbol
of
the
practice
of
good
works
and
while
crossing
on
his
breast
the
stole
the
symbol
of
his
dignity
and
power
la
teuse
had
to
help
vincent
in
the
work
of
adjusting
the
chasuble
which
she
fastened
together
with
slender
tapes
so
that
it
might
not
slip
off
behind

stammered

cupboard

filled
the
cruets

of
coarse
glass
while

hastened
to

drawer

holding
the
chalice
by
its
stem
with
his
left
hand
the
fingers
of

resting

on

bowed
profoundly
but
without
removing
his

to
a

crucifix

hung
over
the

too
and
bearing
the
cruets
covered
with
the
led
the
way
out
of
the
sacristy
followed
by
the
priest
who
walked
on
with
downcast
eyes
absorbed
in
deep
and
prayerful
meditation
ii
the
empty
church
was
quite
white
that
may
morning
the
near
the
confessional
hung
motionless

with
its
stained

like
a
crimson
splotch
against
the
wall
on
the
right
of

tabernacle
vincent
having
set
the
cruets
on
the
credence
came
back
and
knelt
just
below
the
altar
step
on
the
left
while
the
priest
after
rendering
homage
to
the
holy
sacrament
by
a
genuflexion
went
up
to
the
altar
and
there
spread
out
the
corporal
on
the
centre
of
which
he
placed
the
chalice
then
having
opened
the
missal
he
came
down
again
another
bend
of
the
knee
followed
and
after
crossing
himself
and
uttering
aloud
the
formula
in
the
name
of
the
father
the
son
and
the
holy
ghost
he
raised
his
joined
hands
to
his
breast
and
entered
on
the
great
divine
drama
with
his
countenance
blanched
by
faith
and
love
ad
altare
deum
qui
loetificat
juventutem
gabbled
vincent
who
squatting
on
his
heels
mumbled
the
responses
of
the
antiphon
and
the
psalm
while
watching
la
teuse
as
she
roved
about
the
church
the
old
servant
was
gazing
at
one
of
the
candles
with
a
troubled
look
her
anxiety
seemed
to
increase
while
the
priest
bowing
down
with
hands
joined
again
recited
the
she
stood
still
in
her
turn
struck
her
breast
her
head
bowed
but
still
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
the
taper
for
another
minute
the
priest
s
grave
voice
and
the
server
s
stammers
alternated
cum

then
the
priest
spreading
out
his
hands
and
afterwards
again
joining
them
said
with
devout
compunction
let
us
pray
la
teuse
could
now
stand
it
no
longer
but
stepped
behind
the
altar
reached
the
guttering
candle
and
trimmed
it
with
the
points
of
her
scissors
two
large
blobs
of
wax
had
already
been
wasted
when
she
came
back
again
putting
the
benches
straight
on
her
way
and
making
sure
that
there
was
in
the
fonts
the
priest
whose
hands
were
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
was
praying
in
subdued
tones
and
at
last
he
kissed
the
altar
behind
him
the
little
church
still
looked
wan
in
the
pale
light
of
early
morn
the
sun
as
yet
was
only
level
with
the
tiled
roof
the
rang
quiveringly
through
that
sort
of
whitewashed
stable
with
flat
ceiling
and
bedaubed
beams
on
either
side
three
lofty
windows
of
plain
glass
most
of
them
cracked
or
smashed
let
in
a
raw
light
of
chalky
crudeness
the
free
air
poured
in
as
it
listed
emphasising
the
naked
poverty
of
the
god
of
that
forlorn
village
at
the
far
end
of
the
church
above
the
big
door
which
was
never
opened
and
the
threshold
of
which
was
green
with
weeds
a
boarded
gallery
reached
by
a
common
miller
s
ladder
stretched
from
wall
to
wall
dire
were
its
creakings
on
festival
days
beneath
the
weight
of
wooden
shoes
near
the
ladder
stood
the
confessional
with
warped
panels
painted
a
lemon
yellow
facing
it
beside
the
little
door
stood
the
font
a
former
stoup
resting
on
a
stonework
pedestal
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
halfway
down
the
church
two
narrow
altars
stood
against
the
wall
surrounded
by
wooden
balustrades
on
the
one
dedicated
to
the
blessed
virgin
was
a
large
gilded
plaster
statue
of
the
mother
of
god
wearing
a
regal
gold
crown
upon
her
chestnut
hair
while
on
her
left
arm
sat
the
divine
child
nude
and
smiling
whose
little
hand
raised
the
orb
of
the
universe
the
virgin
s
feet
were
poised
on
clouds
and
beneath
them
peeped
the
heads
of
winged
cherubs
then
the
altar
used
for
the
masses
for
the
dead
was
surmounted
by
a
crucifix
of
painted
a
pendant
as
it
were
to
the
virgin
s
effigy
the
figure
of
christ
as
large
as
a
child
of
ten
years
old
showed
him
in
all
the
horror
of
his
with
head
thrown
back
ribs
projecting
abdomen
hollowed
in
and
limbs
distorted
and
splashed
with
blood
there
was
a
pulpit
too
a
square
box
reached
by
a
block
near
a
clock
with
running
weights
in
a
walnut
case
whose
thuds
shook
the
whole
church
like
the
beatings
of
some
huge
heart
concealed
it
might
be
under
the
stone
flags
all
along
the
nave
the
fourteen
stations
of
the
cross
fourteen
coarsely
coloured
prints
in
narrow
black
frames
bespeckled
the
staring
whiteness
of
the
walls
with
the
yellow
blue
and
scarlet
of
scenes
from
the
passion
stuttered
out
vincent
at
the
end
of
the
epistle
the
mystery
of
love
the
immolation
of
the
holy
victim
was
about
to
begin
the
server
took
the
missal
and
bore
it
to
the
left
or
of
the
altar
taking
care
not
to
touch
the
pages
of
the
book
each
time
he
passed
before
the
tabernacle
he
made
a
genuflexion
slantwise
which
threw
him
all
askew
returning
to
the
side
once
more
he
stood
upright
with
crossed
arms
during
the
reading
of
the
gospel
the
priest
after
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
the
missal
next
crossed
himself
first
upon
his
forehead
to
declare
that
he
would
never
blush
for
the
divine
word
then
on
his
mouth
to
show
his
unchanging
readiness
to
confess
his
faith
and
finally
on
his
heart
to
mark
that
it
belonged
to
god
alone
said
he
turning
round
and
facing
the
cold
white
church
cum
spiritu
answered
vincent
who
once
more
was
on
his
knees
the
offertory
having
been
recited
the
priest
uncovered
the
chalice
for
a
moment
he
held
before
his
breast
the
paten
containing
the
host
which
he
offered
up
to
god
for
himself
for
those
present
and
for
all
the
faithful
living
and
dead
then
slipping
it
on
to
the
edge
of
the
corporal
without
touching
it
with
his
fingers
he
took
up
the
chalice
and
carefully
wiped
it
with
the
purificator
vincent
had
in
the
meanwhile
fetched
the
cruets
from
the
credence
table
and
now
presented
them
in
turn
first
the
wine
and
then
the
water
the
priest
then
offered
up
on
behalf
of
the
whole
world
the
chalice
which
he
next
replaced
upon
the
corporal
and
covered
with
the
pall
then
once
again
he
prayed
and
returned
to
the
side
of
the
altar
where
the
server
let
a
little
water
dribble
over
his
thumbs
and
forefingers
to
purify
him
from
the
slightest
sinful
stain
when
he
had
dried
his
hands
on
the
la
teuse
who
stood
there
waiting
emptied
the
into
a
zinc
pail
at
the
corner
of
the
altar
resumed
the
priest
aloud
as
he
faced
the
empty
benches
extending
and
reclasping
his
hands
in
a
gesture
of
appeal
to
all
men
of
and
turning
again
towards
the
altar
he
continued
his
prayer
in
a
lower
tone
while
vincent
began
to
mutter
a
long
latin
sentence
in
which
he
eventually
got
lost
now
it
was
that
the
yellow
sunbeams
began
to
dart
through
the
windows
called
as
it
were
by
the
priest
the
sun
itself
had
come
to
mass
throwing
golden
sheets
of
light
upon
the
wall
the
confessional
the
virgin
s
altar
and
the
big
clock
a
gentle
creak
came
from
the
confessional
the
mother
of
god
in
a
halo
in
the
dazzlement
of
her
golden
crown
and
mantle
smiled
tenderly
with
tinted
lips
upon
the
infant
jesus
and
the
heated
clock
throbbed
out
the
time
with
quickening
strokes
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
peopled
the
benches
with
the
dusty
motes
that
danced
in
his
beams
as
if
the
little
church
that
whitened
stable
were
filled
with
a
glowing
throng
without
were
heard
the
sounds
that
told
of
the
happy
waking
of
the
countryside
the
blades
of
grass
sighed
out
content
the
damp
leaves
dried
themselves
in
the
warmth
the
birds
pruned
their
feathers
and
took
a
first
flit
round
and
indeed
the
countryside
itself
seemed
to
enter
with
the
sun
for
beside
one
of
the
windows
a
large
rowan
tree
shot
up
thrusting
some
of
its
branches
through
the
shattered
panes
and
stretching
out
leafy
buds
as
if
to
take
a
peep
within
while
through
the
fissures
of
the
great
door
the
weeds
on
the
threshold
threatened
to
encroach
upon
the
nave
amid
all
this
quickening
life
the
big
christ
still
in
shadow
alone
displayed
signs
of
death
the
sufferings
of
and
flesh
a
sparrow
raised
himself
up
for
a
moment
at
the
edge
of
a
hole
took
a
glance
then
flew
away
but
only
to
reappear
almost
immediately
when
with
noiseless
wing
he
dropped
between
the
benches
before
the
virgin
s
altar
a
second
sparrow
followed
and
soon
from
all
the
boughs
of
the
rowan
tree
came
others
that
calmly
hopped
about
the
flags
sanctus
sanctus
dominus
deus
said
the
priest
in
a
low
tone
whilst
slightly
stooping
vincent
rang
the
little
bell
thrice
and
the
sparrows
scared
by
the
sudden
tinkling
flew
off
with
such
a
mighty
buzz
of
wings
that
la
teuse
who
had
just
gone
back
into
the
sacristy
came
out
again
grumbling
the
little
rascals
they
will
mess
everything
i
ll
bet
that
mademoiselle
desiree
has
been
here
again
to
scatter
for
the
dread
moment
was
at
hand
the
body
and
the
blood
of
a
god
were
about
to
descend
upon
the
altar
the
priest
kissed
the
clasped
his
hands
and
multiplied
signs
of
the
cross
over
host
and
chalice
the
prayers
of
the
canon
of
the
mass
now
fell
from
his
lips
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
humility
and
gratitude
his
attitude
his
gestures
the
inflections
of
his
voice
all
expressed
his
consciousness
of
his
littleness
his
emotion
at
being
selected
for
so
great
a
task
vincent
came
and
knelt
beside
him
lightly
lifted
the
chasuble
with
his
left
hand
the
bell
ready
in
his
right
and
the
priest
his
elbows
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
altar
holding
the
host
with
the
thumbs
and
forefingers
of
both
hands
pronounced
over
it
the
words
of
consecration
est
enim
corpus
then
having
bowed
the
knee
before
it
he
raised
it
slowly
as
high
as
his
hands
could
reach
following
it
upwards
with
his
eyes
while
the
kneeling
server
rang
the
bell
thrice
then
he
consecrated
the
wine
est
enim
leaning
once
more
upon
his
elbows
bowing
raising
the
cup
aloft
his
right
hand
round
the
stem
his
left
holding
its
base
and
his
eyes
following
it
aloft
again
the
server
rang
the
bell
three
times
the
great
mystery
of
the
redemption
had
once
more
been
repeated
once
more
had
the
adorable
blood
flowed
forth
just
you
wait
a
bit
growled
la
teuse
as
she
tried
to
scare
away
the
sparrows
with
outstretched
fist
but
the
sparrows
were
now
fearless
they
had
come
back
even
while
the
bell
was
ringing
and
unabashed
were
fluttering
about
the
benches
the
repeated
tinklings
even
roused
them
into
liveliness
and
they
answered
back
with
little
chirps
which
crossed
amid
the
latin
words
of
prayer
like
the
rippling
laughs
of
free
urchins
the
sun
warmed
their
plumage
the
sweet
poverty
of
the
church
captivated
them
they
felt
at
home
there
as
in
some
barn
whose
shutters
had
been
left
open
and
screeched
fought
and
squabbled
over
the
crumbs
they
found
upon
the
floor
one
flew
to
perch
himself
on
the
smiling
virgin
s
golden
veil
another
whose
daring
put
the
old
servant
in
a
towering
rage
made
a
hasty
reconnaissance
of
la
teuse
s
skirts
and
at
the
altar
the
priest
with
every
faculty
absorbed
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
sacred
host
his
thumbs
and
forefingers
joined
did
not
even
hear
this
invasion
of
the
warm
may
morning
this
rising
flood
of
sunlight
greenery
and
birds
which
overflowed
even
to
the
foot
of
the
calvary
where
doomed
nature
was
wrestling
in
the
omnia
soecula
he
said
amen
answered
vincent
the
ended
the
priest
holding
the
host
over
the
chalice
broke
it
in
the
centre
detaching
a
particle
from
one
of
the
halves
he
dropped
it
into
the
precious
blood
to
symbolise
the
intimate
union
into
which
he
was
about
to
enter
with
god
he
said
the
aloud
softly
recited
the
three
prescribed
prayers
and
made
his
act
of
unworthiness
and
then
with
his
elbows
resting
on
the
altar
and
with
the
paten
beneath
his
chin
he
partook
of
both
portions
of
the
host
at
once
after
a
fervent
meditation
with
his
hands
clasped
before
his
face
he
took
the
paten
and
gathered
from
the
corporal
the
sacred
particles
of
the
host
that
had
fallen
and
dropped
them
into
the
chalice
one
particle
which
had
adhered
to
his
thumb
he
removed
with
his
forefinger
and
crossing
himself
chalice
in
hand
with
the
paten
once
again
below
his
chin
he
drank
all
the
precious
blood
in
three
draughts
never
taking
his
lips
from
the
cup
s
rim
but
imbibing
the
divine
sacrifice
to
the
last
drop
vincent
had
risen
to
fetch
the
cruets
from
the
credence
table
but
suddenly
the
door
of
the
passage
leading
to
the
parsonage
flew
open
and
swung
back
against
the
wall
to
admit
a
handsome
girl
of
who
carried
something
hidden
in
her
apron
thirteen
of
them
she
called
out
all
the
eggs
were
and
she
opened
out
her
apron
and
revealed
a
brood
of
little
shivering
chicks
with
sprouting
down
and
beady
black
eyes
do
just
look
said
she
aren
t
they
sweet
little
pets
the
darlings
oh
look
at
the
little
white
one
climbing
on
the
others
backs
and
the
spotted
one
already
flapping
his
tiny
wings
the
eggs
were
a
splendid
lot
not
one
of
them
la
teuse
who
was
helping
to
serve
the
mass
in
spite
of
all
prohibitions
and
was
at
that
very
moment
handing
the
cruets
to
vincent
for
the
ablutions
thereupon
turned
round
and
loudly
exclaimed
do
be
quiet
mademoiselle
desiree
don
t
you
see
we
haven
t
finished
yet
through
the
open
doorway
now
came
the
strong
smell
of
a
farmyard
blowing
like
some
generative
ferment
into
the
church
amidst
the
warm
sunlight
that
was
creeping
over
the
altar
desiree
stood
there
for
a
moment
delighted
with
the
little
ones
she
carried
watching
vincent
pour
and
her
brother
drink
the
purifying
wine
in
order
that
nought
of
the
sacred
elements
should
be
left
within
his
mouth
and
she
stood
there
still
when
he
came
back
to
the
side
of
the
altar
holding
the
chalice
in
both
hands
so
that
vincent
might
pour
over
his
forefingers
and
thumbs
the
wine
and
water
of
ablution
which
he
likewise
drank
but
when
the
mother
hen
ran
up
clucking
with
alarm
to
seek
her
little
ones
and
threatened
to
force
her
way
into
the
church
desiree
went
off
talking
maternally
to
her
chicks
while
the
priest
after
pressing
the
purificator
to
his
lips
wiped
first
the
rim
and
next
the
interior
of
the
chalice
then
came
the
end
the
act
of
thanksgiving
to
god
for
the
last
time
the
server
removed
the
missal
and
brought
it
back
to
the
side
the
priest
replaced
the
purificator
paten
and
pall
upon
the
chalice
once
more
pinched
the
two
large
folds
of
the
veil
together
and
laid
upon
it
the
burse
containing
the
corporal
his
whole
being
was
now
one
act
of
ardent
thanksgiving
he
besought
from
heaven
the
forgiveness
of
his
sins
the
grace
of
a
holy
life
and
the
reward
of
everlasting
life
he
remained
as
if
overwhelmed
by
this
miracle
of
love
the
immolation
which
sustained
him
day
by
day
with
the
blood
and
flesh
of
his
savior
having
read
the
final
prayers
he
turned
and
said
missa
answered
vincent
and
having
turned
back
to
kiss
the
altar
the
priest
faced
round
anew
his
left
hand
just
below
his
breast
his
right
outstretched
whilst
blessing
the
church
which
the
gladsome
sunbeams
and
noisy
sparrows
filled
vos
omnipotens
deus
pater
et
filius
et
spiritus
said
the
server
as
he
crossed
himself
the
sun
had
risen
higher
and
the
sparrows
were
growing
bolder
while
the
priest
read
from
the
the
passage
of
the
gospel
of
john
announcing
the
eternity
of
the
word
the
sunrays
set
the
altar
ablaze
whitened
the
panels
of
imitation
marble
and
dimmed
the
flame
of
the
two
candles
whose
short
wicks
were
now
merely
two
dull
spots
the
victorious
orb
enveloped
with
his
glory
the
crucifix
the
candlesticks
the
chasuble
the
veil
of
the
chalice
all
the
gold
work
that
paled
beneath
his
beams
and
when
at
last
the
priest
after
taking
the
chalice
in
his
hands
and
making
a
genuflexion
covered
his
head
and
turned
from
the
altar
to
follow
the
server
laden
with
the
cruets
and
to
the
sacristy
the
planet
remained
sole
master
of
the
church
its
rays
in
turn
now
rested
on
the
irradiating
the
with
splendour
and
celebrating
the
fertile
powers
of
may
warmth
rose
from
the
stone
flags
the
daubed
walls
the
tall
virgin
the
huge
christ
too
all
seemed
to
quiver
as
with
shooting
sap
as
if
death
had
been
conquered
by
the
earth
s
eternal
youth
iii
le
teuse
hastily
put
out
the
candles
but
lingered
to
make
one
last
attempt
to
drive
away
the
sparrows
and
so
when
she
returned
to
the
sacristy
with
the
missal
she
no
longer
found
abbe
mouret
there
having
washed
his
hands
and
put
away
the
sacred
vessels
and
vestments
he
was
now
standing
in
the
dining
room
breakfasting
off
a
cup
of
milk
you
really
ought
to
prevent
your
sister
from
scattering
bread
in
the
church
said
la
teuse
on
coming
in
it
was
last
winter
she
hit
upon
that
pretty
prank
she
said
the
sparrows
were
cold
and
that
god
might
well
give
them
some
food
you
see
she
ll
end
by
making
us
sleep
with
all
her
fowls
and
we
should
be
all
the
warmer
pleasantly
replied
the
young
priest
you
are
always
grumbling
la
teuse
do
let
our
poor
desiree
pet
her
animals
she
has
no
other
pleasure
poor
innocent
the
servant
took
her
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
room
i
do
believe
you
yourself
wouldn
t
mind
a
bit
if
the
magpies
actually
built
their
nests
in
the
church
you
never
can
see
anything
everything
seems
just
what
it
ought
to
be
to
you
your
sister
is
precious
lucky
in
having
had
you
to
take
charge
of
her
when
you
left
the
seminary
no
father
no
mother
i
should
like
to
know
who
would
let
her
mess
about
as
she
does
in
a
then
softening
she
added
in
a
gentler
tone
to
be
sure
it
would
be
a
pity
to
cross
her
she
hasn
t
a
touch
of
malice
in
her
she
s
like
a
child
of
ten
although
she
s
one
of
the
finest
grown
girls
in
the
neighbourhood
and
i
have
to
put
her
to
bed
as
you
know
every
night
and
send
her
to
sleep
with
stories
just
like
a
little
abbe
mouret
had
remained
standing
finishing
the
cup
of
milk
he
held
between
his
fingers
which
were
slightly
reddened
by
the
chill
atmosphere
of
the
a
large
room
with
painted
grey
walls
a
floor
of
square
tiles
and
having
no
furniture
beyond
a
table
and
a
few
chairs
la
teuse
picked
up
a
napkin
which
she
had
laid
at
a
corner
of
the
table
in
readiness
for
breakfast
it
isn
t
much
linen
you
dirty
she
muttered
one
would
think
you
could
never
sit
down
that
you
are
always
just
about
to
start
off
ah
if
you
had
known
monsieur
caffin
the
poor
dead
priest
whose
place
you
have
taken
what
a
man
he
was
for
comfort
why
he
couldn
t
have
digested
his
food
if
he
had
eaten
standing
a
norman
he
was
from
canteleu
like
myself
i
don
t
thank
him
i
tell
you
for
having
brought
me
to
such
a
country
as
this
when
first
we
came
o
lord
how
bored
we
were
but
the
poor
priest
had
had
some
uncomfortable
tales
going
about
him
at
home
why
sir
didn
t
you
sweeten
your
milk
then
aren
t
those
the
two
lumps
of
sugar
the
priest
put
down
his
cup
yes
i
must
have
forgotten
i
believe
he
said
la
teuse
stared
at
him
and
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
folded
up
inside
the
napkin
a
slice
of
stale
bread
which
had
also
been
left
untouched
on
the
table
then
just
as
the
priest
was
about
to
go
out
she
ran
after
him
and
knelt
down
at
his
feet
exclaiming
stop
your
are
not
even
fastened
i
can
not
imagine
how
your
feet
can
stand
those
peasant
shoes
you
re
such
a
little
tender
man
and
look
as
if
you
had
been
preciously
spoilt
ah
the
bishop
must
have
known
a
deal
about
you
to
go
and
give
you
the
poorest
living
in
the
but
it
was
i
who
chose
les
artaud
said
the
priest
breaking
into
another
smile
you
are
very
this
morning
la
teuse
are
we
not
happy
here
we
have
got
all
we
want
and
our
life
is
as
peaceful
as
if
in
she
then
restrained
herself
and
laughed
in
her
turn
saying
you
are
a
holy
man
monsieur
le
cure
but
come
and
see
what
a
splendid
wash
i
have
got
that
will
be
better
than
squabbling
with
one
the
priest
was
obliged
to
follow
for
she
might
prevent
him
going
out
at
all
if
he
did
not
compliment
her
on
her
washing
as
he
left
the
he
stumbled
over
a
heap
of
rubbish
in
the
passage
what
is
this
he
asked
oh
nothing
said
la
teuse
in
her
grimest
tone
it
s
only
the
parsonage
coming
down
however
you
are
quite
content
you
ve
got
all
you
want
good
heavens
there
are
holes
and
to
spare
just
look
at
that
ceiling
now
isn
t
it
cracked
all
over
if
we
don
t
get
buried
alive
one
of
these
days
we
shall
owe
a
precious
big
taper
to
our
guardian
angel
however
if
it
suits
you
it
s
like
the
church
those
broken
panes
ought
to
have
been
replaced
these
two
years
in
winter
our
lord
gets
frozen
with
the
cold
besides
it
would
keep
out
those
rascally
sparrows
i
shall
paste
paper
over
the
holes
you
see
if
i
don
a
capital
idea
murmured
the
priest
they
might
very
well
be
pasted
over
as
to
the
walls
they
are
stouter
than
we
think
in
my
room
the
floor
has
only
given
way
slightly
in
front
of
the
window
the
house
will
see
us
all
on
reaching
the
little
open
shed
near
the
kitchen
in
order
to
please
la
teuse
he
went
into
ecstasies
over
the
washing
he
even
had
to
dip
his
fingers
into
it
and
feel
it
this
so
pleased
the
old
woman
that
her
attentions
became
quite
motherly
she
no
longer
scolded
but
ran
to
fetch
a
saying
you
surely
are
not
going
out
with
yesterday
s
mud
on
your
cassock
if
you
had
left
it
out
on
the
banister
it
would
be
clean
now
it
s
still
a
good
one
but
do
lift
it
up
well
when
you
cross
any
field
the
thistles
tear
while
speaking
she
kept
turning
him
round
like
a
child
shaking
him
from
head
to
foot
with
her
energetic
brushing
there
there
that
will
do
he
said
escaping
from
her
at
last
take
care
of
desiree
won
t
you
i
will
tell
her
i
am
going
but
at
this
minute
a
fresh
clear
voice
called
to
him
serge
serge
desiree
came
flying
up
her
cheeks
ruddy
with
glee
her
head
bare
her
black
locks
twisted
tightly
upon
her
neck
and
her
hands
and
arms
smothered
up
to
the
elbows
with
manure
she
had
been
cleaning
out
her
poultry
house
when
she
caught
sight
of
her
brother
just
about
to
go
out
with
his
breviary
under
his
arm
she
laughed
aloud
and
kissed
him
on
his
mouth
with
her
arms
thrown
back
behind
her
to
avoid
soiling
him
no
no
she
hurriedly
exclaimed
i
should
dirty
you
oh
i
am
having
such
fun
you
must
see
the
animals
when
you
come
thereupon
she
fled
away
again
abbe
mouret
then
said
that
he
would
be
back
about
eleven
for
luncheon
and
as
he
started
la
teuse
who
had
followed
him
to
the
doorstep
shouted
after
him
her
last
injunctions
don
t
forget
to
see
brother
archangias
and
look
in
also
at
the
brichets
the
wife
came
again
yesterday
about
that
wedding
just
listen
monsieur
le
cure
i
met
their
rosalie
she
d
ask
nothing
better
than
to
marry
big
fortune
have
a
talk
with
old
bambousse
perhaps
he
will
listen
to
you
now
and
don
t
come
back
at
twelve
o
clock
like
the
other
day
come
say
you
ll
be
back
at
eleven
won
t
you
but
the
priest
turned
round
no
more
so
she
went
in
again
growling
between
her
teeth
when
does
he
ever
listen
to
me
barely
years
old
and
does
just
as
he
likes
to
be
sure
he
s
an
old
man
of
sixty
for
holiness
but
then
he
has
never
known
life
he
knows
nothing
it
s
no
trouble
to
him
to
be
as
good
as
a
cherub
iv
when
abbe
mouret
had
got
beyond
all
hearing
of
la
teuse
he
stopped
thankful
to
be
alone
at
last
the
church
was
built
on
a
hillock
which
sloped
down
gently
to
the
village
with
its
large
gaping
windows
and
bright
red
tiles
it
stretched
out
like
a
deserted
the
priest
turned
round
and
glanced
at
the
parsonage
a
greyish
building
springing
from
the
very
side
of
the
church
but
as
if
fearful
that
he
might
again
be
overtaken
by
the
interminable
chatter
that
had
been
buzzing
in
his
ears
ever
since
morning
he
turned
up
to
the
right
again
and
only
felt
safe
when
he
at
last
stood
before
the
great
doorway
where
he
could
not
be
seen
from
the
parsonage
the
front
of
the
church
quite
bare
and
worn
by
the
sunshine
and
rain
of
years
was
crowned
by
a
narrow
open
stone
belfry
in
which
a
small
bell
showed
its
black
silhouette
whilst
its
rope
disappeared
through
the
tiles
six
broken
steps
on
one
side
half
buried
in
the
earth
led
up
to
the
lofty
arched
door
now
cracked
smothered
with
dust
and
rust
and
cobwebs
and
so
frailly
hung
upon
its
outwrenched
hinges
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
first
slight
puff
would
secure
free
entrance
to
the
winds
of
heaven
abbe
mouret
who
had
an
affection
for
this
dilapidated
door
leaned
against
one
of
its
leaves
as
he
stood
upon
the
steps
thence
he
could
survey
the
whole
country
round
at
a
glance
and
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hands
he
scanned
the
horizon
in
the
month
of
may
exuberant
vegetation
burst
forth
from
that
stony
soil
gigantic
lavenders
juniper
bushes
patches
of
rank
herbage
swarmed
over
the
church
threshold
and
scattered
clumps
of
dark
greenery
even
to
the
very
tiles
it
seemed
as
if
the
first
throb
of
shooting
sap
in
the
tough
matted
underwood
might
well
topple
the
church
over
at
that
early
hour
amid
all
the
travail
of
nature
s
growth
there
was
a
hum
of
vivifying
warmth
and
the
very
rocks
quivered
as
with
a
long
and
silent
effort
but
the
abbe
failed
to
comprehend
the
ardour
of
nature
s
painful
labour
he
simply
thought
that
the
steps
were
tottering
and
thereupon
leant
against
the
other
side
of
the
door
the
countryside
stretched
away
for
a
distance
of
six
miles
bounded
by
a
wall
of
tawny
hills
speckled
with
black
it
was
a
fearful
landscape
of
arid
wastes
and
rocky
spurs
rending
the
soil
the
few
patches
of
arable
ground
were
like
scattered
pools
of
blood
red
fields
with
rows
of
lean
almond
trees
olive
trees
and
long
lines
of
vines
streaking
the
soil
with
their
brown
stems
it
was
as
if
some
huge
conflagration
had
swept
by
there
scattering
the
ashes
of
forests
over
the
consuming
all
the
grass
of
the
meadow
lands
and
leaving
its
glare
and
heat
behind
in
the
hollows
only
here
and
there
was
the
softer
note
of
a
pale
green
patch
of
growing
corn
the
landscape
generally
was
wild
lacking
even
a
threadlet
of
water
dying
of
thirst
and
flying
away
in
clouds
of
dust
at
the
least
breath
of
wind
but
at
the
farthest
point
where
the
crumbling
hills
on
the
horizon
had
left
a
breach
one
espied
some
distant
fresh
moist
greenery
a
stretch
of
the
neighbouring
valley
fertilised
by
the
viorne
a
river
flowing
down
from
the
gorges
of
the
seille
the
priest
lowered
his
dazzled
glance
upon
the
village
whose
few
scattered
houses
straggled
away
below
the
church
wretched
hovels
they
were
of
rubble
and
boards
strewn
along
a
narrow
path
without
sign
of
streets
there
were
about
thirty
of
them
altogether
some
squatting
amidst
and
black
with
woeful
want
others
roomier
and
more
with
their
roofs
of
pinkish
tiles
strips
of
garden
victoriously
planted
amidst
stony
soil
displayed
plots
of
vegetables
enclosed
by
quickset
hedges
at
this
hour
les
artaud
was
empty
not
a
woman
was
at
the
windows
not
a
child
was
wallowing
in
the
dust
parties
of
fowls
alone
went
to
and
fro
ferreting
among
the
straw
seeking
food
up
to
the
very
thresholds
of
the
houses
whose
open
doors
gaped
in
the
sunlight
a
big
black
dog
seated
on
his
haunches
at
the
entrance
to
the
village
seemed
to
be
mounting
guard
over
it
languor
slowly
stole
over
abbe
mouret
the
rising
sun
steeped
him
in
such
warmth
that
he
leant
back
against
the
church
door
pervaded
by
a
feeling
of
happy
restfulness
his
thoughts
were
dwelling
on
that
hamlet
of
les
artaud
which
had
sprung
up
there
among
the
stones
like
one
of
the
knotty
growths
of
the
valley
all
its
inhabitants
were
related
all
bore
the
same
name
so
that
from
their
very
cradle
they
were
distinguished
among
themselves
by
nicknames
an
artaud
their
ancestor
had
come
hither
and
settled
like
a
pariah
in
this
waste
his
family
had
grown
with
all
the
wild
vitality
of
the
herbage
that
sucked
life
from
the
rocky
boulders
it
had
at
last
become
a
tribe
a
rural
community
in
which
were
lost
in
the
mists
of
centuries
they
intermarried
with
shameless
promiscuity
not
an
instance
could
be
cited
of
any
artaud
taking
himself
a
wife
from
any
neighbouring
village
only
some
of
the
girls
occasionally
went
elsewhere
the
others
were
born
and
died
fixed
to
that
spot
leisurely
increasing
and
multiplying
on
their
dunghills
with
the
irreflectiveness
of
trees
and
with
no
definite
notion
of
the
world
that
lay
beyond
the
tawny
rocks
in
whose
midst
they
vegetated
and
yet
there
were
already
rich
and
poor
among
them
fowls
having
at
times
disappeared
the
were
now
closed
at
night
with
stout
padlocks
moreover
one
artaud
had
killed
another
artaud
one
evening
behind
the
mill
these
folk
begirt
by
that
belt
of
desolate
hills
were
truly
a
people
apart
a
race
sprung
from
the
soil
a
miniature
replica
of
mankind
three
hundred
souls
all
told
beginning
the
centuries
yet
once
again
over
the
priest
the
sombre
shadows
of
seminary
life
still
hovered
for
years
he
had
never
seen
the
sun
he
perceived
it
not
even
now
his
eyes
closed
and
gazing
inwards
on
his
soul
and
with
no
feeling
for
perishable
nature
fated
to
damnation
save
contempt
for
a
long
time
in
his
hours
of
devout
thought
he
had
dreamt
of
some
hermit
s
desert
of
some
mountain
hole
where
no
living
thing
neither
being
plant
nor
water
should
distract
him
from
the
contemplation
of
god
it
was
an
impulse
springing
from
the
purest
love
from
a
loathing
of
all
physical
sensation
there
dying
to
self
and
with
his
back
turned
to
the
light
of
day
he
would
have
waited
till
he
should
cease
to
be
till
nothing
should
remain
of
him
but
the
sovereign
whiteness
of
the
soul
to
him
heaven
seemed
all
white
with
a
luminous
whiteness
as
if
lilies
there
snowed
down
upon
one
as
if
every
form
of
purity
innocence
and
chastity
there
blazed
but
his
confessor
reproved
him
whenever
he
related
his
longings
for
solitude
his
cravings
for
an
existence
of
godlike
purity
and
recalled
him
to
the
struggles
of
the
church
the
necessary
duties
of
the
priesthood
later
on
after
his
ordination
the
young
priest
had
come
to
les
artaud
at
his
own
request
there
hoping
to
realise
his
dream
of
human
annihilation
in
that
desolate
spot
on
that
barren
soil
he
might
shut
his
ears
to
all
worldly
sounds
and
live
the
dreamy
life
of
a
saint
for
some
months
past
in
truth
his
existence
had
been
wholly
undisturbed
rarely
had
any
thrill
of
the
disturbed
him
and
even
the
sun
s
heat
scarcely
brought
him
any
glow
of
feeling
as
he
walked
the
paths
his
whole
being
wrapped
in
heaven
heedless
of
the
unceasing
travail
of
life
amidst
which
he
moved
the
big
black
dog
watching
over
les
artaud
had
determined
to
come
up
to
abbe
mouret
and
now
sat
upon
its
haunches
at
the
priest
s
feet
but
the
unconscious
man
remained
absorbed
amidst
the
sweetness
of
the
morning
on
the
previous
evening
he
had
begun
the
exercises
of
the
rosary
and
to
the
intercession
of
the
virgin
with
her
divine
son
he
attributed
the
great
joy
which
filled
his
soul
how
despicable
appeared
all
the
good
things
of
the
earth
how
thankfully
he
recognised
his
poverty
when
he
entered
into
holy
orders
after
losing
on
the
same
day
both
his
father
and
his
mother
through
a
tragedy
the
fearful
details
of
which
were
even
now
unknown
to
him
he
had
relinquished
all
his
share
of
their
property
to
an
elder
brother
his
only
remaining
link
with
the
world
was
his
sister
he
had
undertaken
the
care
of
her
stirred
by
a
kind
of
religious
affection
for
her
feeble
intelligence
the
dear
innocent
was
so
childish
such
a
very
little
girl
that
she
recalled
to
him
the
poor
in
spirit
to
whom
the
gospel
promises
the
kingdom
of
heaven
of
late
however
she
had
somewhat
disturbed
him
she
was
growing
too
lusty
too
full
of
health
and
life
but
his
discomfort
was
yet
of
the
slightest
his
days
were
spent
in
that
inner
life
he
had
created
for
himself
for
which
he
had
relinquished
all
else
he
closed
the
portals
of
his
senses
and
sought
to
free
himself
from
all
bodily
needs
so
that
he
might
be
but
a
soul
enrapt
in
contemplation
to
him
nature
offered
only
snares
and
abominations
he
gloried
in
maltreating
her
in
despising
her
in
releasing
himself
from
his
human
slime
and
as
the
just
man
must
be
a
fool
according
to
the
world
he
considered
himself
an
exile
on
this
earth
his
thoughts
were
solely
fixed
upon
the
favours
of
heaven
incapable
as
he
was
of
understanding
how
an
eternity
of
bliss
could
be
weighed
against
a
few
hours
of
perishable
enjoyment
his
reason
duped
him
and
his
senses
lied
and
if
he
advanced
in
virtue
it
was
particularly
by
humility
and
obedience
his
wish
was
to
be
the
last
of
all
one
subject
to
all
in
order
that
the
divine
dew
might
fall
upon
his
heart
as
upon
arid
sand
he
considered
himself
overwhelmed
with
reproach
and
with
confusion
unworthy
of
ever
being
saved
from
sin
he
no
longer
belonged
to
himself
blind
deaf
dead
to
the
world
as
he
was
he
was
god
s
thing
and
from
the
depth
of
the
abjectness
to
which
he
sought
to
plunge
hosannahs
suddenly
bore
him
aloft
above
the
happy
and
the
mighty
into
the
splendour
of
bliss
this
forms
the
subject
of
zola
s
novel
conquest
of
ed
thus
at
les
artaud
abbe
mouret
had
once
more
experienced
each
time
he
read
the
imitation
the
raptures
of
the
cloistered
life
which
he
had
longed
for
at
one
time
so
ardently
as
yet
he
had
not
had
to
fight
any
battle
from
the
moment
that
he
knelt
down
he
became
perfect
absolutely
oblivious
of
the
flesh
unresisting
undisturbed
as
if
overpowered
by
the
divine
grace
such
ecstasy
at
god
s
approach
is
well
known
to
some
young
priests
it
is
a
blissful
moment
when
all
is
hushed
and
the
only
desire
is
but
a
boundless
craving
for
purity
from
no
human
creature
had
he
sought
his
consolations
he
who
believes
a
certain
thing
to
be
all
in
all
can
not
be
troubled
and
he
did
believe
that
god
was
all
in
all
and
that
humility
obedience
and
chastity
were
everything
he
could
remember
having
heard
temptation
spoken
of
as
an
abominable
torture
that
tries
the
holiest
but
he
would
only
smile
god
had
never
left
him
he
bore
his
faith
about
him
thus
like
a
protecting
him
from
the
slightest
breath
of
evil
he
could
recall
how
he
had
hidden
himself
and
wept
for
very
love
he
knew
not
whom
he
loved
but
he
wept
for
love
for
love
of
some
one
afar
off
the
recollection
never
failed
to
move
him
later
on
he
had
decided
on
becoming
a
priest
in
order
to
satisfy
that
craving
for
a
superhuman
affection
which
was
his
sole
torment
he
could
not
see
where
greater
love
could
be
in
that
state
of
life
he
satisfied
his
being
his
inherited
predisposition
his
youthful
dreams
his
first
virile
desires
if
temptation
must
come
he
awaited
it
with
the
calmness
of
the
seminarist
ignorant
of
the
world
he
felt
that
his
manhood
had
been
killed
in
him
it
gladdened
him
to
feel
himself
a
creature
set
apart
unsexed
turned
from
the
usual
paths
of
life
and
as
became
a
lamb
of
the
lord
marked
with
the
tonsure
v
while
the
priest
pondered
the
sun
was
heating
the
big
gilded
flies
buzzed
round
a
large
flower
that
was
blooming
between
two
of
the
steps
abbe
mouret
feeling
slightly
dazed
was
at
last
about
to
move
away
when
the
big
black
dog
sprang
barking
violently
towards
the
iron
gate
of
the
little
graveyard
on
the
left
of
the
church
at
the
same
time
a
harsh
voice
called
out
ah
you
young
rascal
so
you
stop
away
from
school
and
i
find
you
in
the
graveyard
oh
don
t
say
no
i
have
been
watching
you
this
quarter
of
an
as
the
priest
stepped
forward
he
saw
vincent
whom
a
brother
of
the
christian
schools
was
clutching
tightly
by
the
ear
the
lad
was
suspended
as
it
were
over
a
ravine
skirting
the
graveyard
at
the
bottom
of
which
flowed
the
mascle
a
mountain
torrent
whose
crystal
waters
plunged
into
the
viorne
six
miles
away
brother
archangias
softly
called
the
priest
as
if
to
appease
the
fearful
man
the
brother
however
did
not
release
the
boy
s
ear
oh
it
s
you
monsieur
le
cure
he
growled
just
fancy
this
rascal
is
always
poking
his
nose
into
the
graveyard
i
don
t
know
what
he
can
be
up
to
here
i
ought
to
let
go
of
him
and
let
him
smash
his
skull
down
there
it
would
be
what
he
the
lad
remained
dumb
with
his
cunning
eyes
tight
shut
as
he
clung
to
the
bushes
take
care
brother
archangias
continued
the
priest
he
might
and
he
himself
helped
vincent
to
scramble
up
again
come
my
young
friend
what
were
you
doing
there
he
asked
you
must
not
go
playing
in
the
lad
had
opened
his
eyes
and
crept
away
fearfully
from
the
brother
to
place
himself
under
the
priest
s
protection
i
ll
tell
you
he
said
in
a
low
voice
as
he
raised
his
bushy
head
there
is
a
tomtit
s
nest
in
the
brambles
there
under
that
rock
for
over
ten
days
i
ve
been
watching
it
and
now
the
little
ones
are
hatched
so
i
came
this
morning
after
serving
your
a
tomtit
s
nest
exclaimed
brother
archangias
wait
a
bit
wait
a
bit
thereupon
he
stepped
aside
picked
a
clod
of
earth
off
a
grave
and
flung
it
into
the
brambles
but
he
missed
the
nest
another
clod
however
more
skilfully
thrown
upset
the
frail
cradle
and
precipitated
the
fledglings
into
the
torrent
below
now
perhaps
he
continued
clapping
his
hands
to
shake
off
the
earth
that
soiled
them
you
won
t
come
roaming
here
any
more
like
a
heathen
the
dead
will
pull
your
feet
at
night
if
you
go
walking
over
them
vincent
who
had
laughed
at
seeing
the
nest
dive
into
the
stream
looked
round
him
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
like
one
of
strong
mind
oh
i
m
not
afraid
he
said
dead
folk
don
t
the
graveyard
in
truth
was
not
a
place
to
inspire
fear
it
was
a
barren
piece
of
ground
whose
narrow
paths
were
smothered
by
rank
weeds
here
and
there
the
soil
was
bossy
with
mounds
a
single
tombstone
that
of
abbe
caffin
and
upright
could
be
perceived
in
the
centre
of
the
ground
save
this
all
around
there
were
only
broken
fragments
of
crosses
withered
tufts
of
box
and
old
slabs
split
and
there
were
not
two
burials
a
year
death
seemed
to
make
no
dwelling
in
that
waste
spot
whither
la
teuse
came
every
evening
to
fill
her
apron
with
grass
for
desiree
s
rabbits
a
gigantic
cypress
tree
standing
near
the
gate
alone
cast
shadow
upon
the
desert
field
this
cypress
a
landmark
visible
for
nine
miles
around
was
known
to
the
whole
countryside
as
the
solitaire
it
s
full
of
lizards
added
vincent
looking
at
the
cracks
of
the
one
could
have
a
fine
lark
but
he
sprang
out
with
a
bound
on
seeing
the
brother
lift
his
foot
the
latter
proceeded
to
call
the
priest
s
attention
to
the
dilapidated
state
of
the
gate
which
was
not
only
eaten
up
with
rust
but
had
one
hinge
off
and
the
lock
broken
it
ought
to
be
repaired
said
he
abbe
mouret
smiled
but
made
no
reply
addressing
vincent
who
was
romping
with
the
dog
i
say
my
boy
he
asked
do
you
know
where
old
bambousse
is
at
work
this
morning
the
lad
glanced
towards
the
horizon
he
must
be
at
his
olivettes
field
now
he
answered
pointing
towards
the
left
but
voriau
will
show
your
reverence
the
way
he
s
sure
to
know
where
his
master
and
he
clapped
his
hands
and
called
hie
voriau
hie
the
big
black
dog
paused
a
moment
wagging
his
tail
and
seeking
to
read
the
urchin
s
eyes
then
barking
joyfully
he
set
off
down
the
slope
to
the
village
abbe
mouret
and
brother
archangias
followed
him
chatting
a
hundred
yards
further
vincent
surreptitiously
bolted
and
again
glided
up
towards
the
church
keeping
a
watchful
eye
upon
them
and
ready
to
dart
behind
a
bush
if
they
should
look
round
with
suppleness
he
once
more
glided
into
the
graveyard
that
paradise
full
of
lizards
nests
and
flowers
meantime
while
voriau
led
the
way
before
them
along
the
dusty
road
brother
archangias
was
angrily
saying
to
the
priest
let
be
monsieur
le
cure
they
re
spawn
of
damnation
those
toads
are
they
ought
to
have
their
backs
broken
to
make
them
pleasing
to
god
they
grow
up
in
irreligion
like
their
fathers
fifteen
years
have
i
been
here
and
not
one
christian
have
i
been
able
to
turn
out
the
minute
they
quit
my
hands
they
think
of
nothing
but
their
land
their
vines
their
not
one
ever
sets
foot
in
church
brute
beasts
they
are
struggling
with
their
stony
fields
guide
them
with
the
stick
monsieur
le
cure
yes
the
stick
then
after
drawing
breath
he
added
with
a
terrific
wave
of
his
hands
those
artauds
look
you
are
like
the
brambles
these
rocks
one
stem
has
been
enough
to
poison
the
whole
district
they
cling
on
they
multiply
they
live
in
spite
of
everything
nothing
short
of
fire
from
heaven
as
at
gomorrha
will
clear
it
all
we
should
never
despair
of
sinners
said
abbe
mouret
all
inward
peacefulness
as
he
leisurely
walked
on
but
these
are
the
devil
s
own
broke
in
the
brother
still
more
violently
i
ve
been
a
peasant
too
up
to
eighteen
i
dug
the
earth
and
later
on
when
i
was
at
the
training
college
i
had
to
sweep
pare
vegetables
do
all
the
heavy
work
it
s
not
their
toilsome
labour
i
find
fault
with
on
the
contrary
for
god
prefers
the
lowly
but
the
artauds
live
like
beasts
they
are
like
their
dogs
they
never
attend
mass
and
make
a
mock
of
the
commandments
of
god
and
of
the
church
they
think
of
nothing
but
their
plots
of
lands
so
sweet
they
are
on
them
voriau
his
tail
wagging
kept
stopping
and
moving
on
again
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
they
still
followed
him
there
certainly
are
some
grievous
things
going
on
said
abbe
mouret
my
predecessor
abbe
caffin
a
poor
specimen
interrupted
the
brother
he
came
here
to
us
from
normandy
owing
to
some
disreputable
affair
once
here
his
sole
thought
was
good
living
he
let
everything
go
to
rack
and
oh
no
abbe
caffin
certainly
did
what
he
could
but
i
must
own
that
his
efforts
were
all
but
barren
in
results
my
own
are
mostly
brother
archangias
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
walked
on
for
a
minute
in
silence
swaying
his
tall
bony
frame
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
roughly
fashioned
with
a
hatchet
the
sun
beat
down
upon
his
neck
shadowing
his
hard
peasant
s
face
listen
to
me
monsieur
le
cure
he
said
at
last
i
am
too
much
beneath
you
to
lecture
you
but
still
i
am
almost
double
your
age
i
know
this
part
and
therefore
i
feel
justified
in
telling
you
that
you
will
gain
nothing
by
gentleness
the
catechism
understand
is
enough
god
has
no
mercy
on
the
wicked
he
burns
them
stick
to
then
as
abbe
mouret
whose
head
remained
bowed
did
not
open
his
mouth
he
went
on
religion
is
leaving
the
country
districts
because
it
is
made
over
indulgent
it
was
respected
when
it
spoke
out
like
an
unforgiving
mistress
i
really
don
t
know
what
they
can
teach
you
now
in
the
seminaries
the
new
priests
weep
like
children
with
their
parishioners
god
no
longer
seems
the
same
i
dare
say
monsieur
le
cure
that
you
don
t
even
know
your
catechism
by
heart
now
but
the
priest
wounded
by
the
imperiousness
with
which
the
brother
so
roughly
sought
to
dominate
him
looked
up
and
dryly
rejoined
that
will
do
your
zeal
is
very
praiseworthy
but
haven
t
you
something
to
tell
me
you
came
to
the
parsonage
this
morning
did
you
not
thereupon
brother
archangias
plumply
answered
i
had
to
tell
you
just
what
i
have
told
you
the
artauds
live
like
pigs
only
yesterday
i
learned
that
rosalie
old
bambousse
s
eldest
daughter
is
in
the
family
way
it
happens
with
all
of
them
before
they
get
married
and
they
simply
laugh
at
reproaches
as
you
yes
murmured
abbe
mouret
it
is
a
great
scandal
i
am
just
on
my
way
to
see
old
bambousse
to
speak
to
him
about
it
it
is
desirable
that
they
should
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
the
child
s
father
it
seems
is
fortune
the
brichets
eldest
son
unfortunately
the
brichets
are
that
rosalie
now
continued
the
brother
is
just
eighteen
not
four
years
since
i
still
had
her
under
me
at
school
and
she
was
already
a
gadabout
i
have
now
got
her
sister
catherine
a
chit
of
eleven
who
seems
likely
to
become
even
worse
than
her
elder
one
comes
across
her
in
every
corner
with
that
little
scamp
vincent
it
s
no
good
you
may
pull
their
ears
till
they
bleed
the
woman
always
crops
up
in
them
they
carry
perdition
about
with
them
and
are
only
fit
to
be
thrown
on
a
what
a
splendid
riddance
if
all
girls
were
strangled
at
their
birth
his
loathing
his
hatred
of
woman
made
him
swear
like
a
carter
abbe
mouret
who
had
been
listening
to
him
with
unmoved
countenance
smiled
at
last
at
his
rabid
utterances
he
called
voriau
who
had
strayed
into
a
field
close
by
there
look
there
cried
brother
archangias
pointing
to
a
group
of
children
playing
at
the
bottom
of
a
ravine
there
are
my
young
devils
who
play
the
truant
under
pretence
of
going
to
help
their
parents
among
the
vines
you
may
be
certain
that
jade
of
a
catherine
is
among
them
there
didn
t
i
tell
you
till
monsieur
le
cure
oh
just
you
wait
you
rascals
off
he
went
at
a
run
his
dirty
neckband
flying
over
his
shoulder
and
his
big
greasy
cassock
tearing
up
the
thistles
abbe
mouret
watched
him
swoop
down
into
the
midst
of
the
children
who
scattered
like
frightened
sparrows
but
he
succeeded
in
seizing
catherine
and
one
boy
by
the
ears
and
led
them
back
towards
the
village
clutching
them
tightly
with
his
big
hairy
fingers
and
overwhelming
them
with
abuse
the
priest
walked
on
again
brother
archangias
sometimes
aroused
strange
scruples
in
his
mind
with
his
vulgarity
and
coarseness
the
brother
seemed
to
him
the
true
man
of
god
free
from
earthly
ties
submissive
in
all
to
heaven
s
will
humble
blunt
ready
to
shower
abuse
upon
sin
he
the
priest
would
then
feel
despair
at
his
inability
to
rid
himself
more
completely
of
his
body
he
regretted
that
he
was
not
ugly
unclean
covered
with
vermin
like
some
of
the
saints
whenever
the
brother
had
wounded
him
by
some
words
of
excessive
coarseness
or
by
some
churlishness
he
would
blame
himself
for
his
refinement
his
innate
shrinking
as
if
these
were
really
faults
ought
he
not
to
be
dead
to
all
the
weaknesses
of
this
world
and
this
time
also
he
smiled
sadly
as
he
thought
how
near
he
had
been
to
losing
his
temper
at
the
brother
s
roughly
put
lesson
it
was
pride
it
seemed
to
him
seeking
to
work
his
perdition
by
making
him
despise
the
lowly
however
in
spite
of
himself
he
felt
relieved
at
being
alone
again
at
being
able
to
walk
on
gently
reading
his
breviary
free
at
last
from
the
grating
voice
that
had
disturbed
his
dream
of
heavenly
love
vi
the
road
wound
on
between
fallen
rocks
among
which
the
peasants
had
succeeded
here
and
there
in
reclaiming
six
or
seven
yards
of
chalky
soil
planted
with
old
olive
trees
under
the
priest
s
feet
the
dust
in
the
deep
ruts
crackled
lightly
like
snow
at
times
as
he
felt
a
warmer
puff
upon
his
face
he
would
raise
his
eyes
from
his
book
as
if
to
seek
whence
came
this
soft
caress
but
his
gaze
was
vacant
straying
without
perception
over
the
glowing
horizon
over
the
twisted
outlines
of
that
landscape
as
it
stretched
out
in
the
sun
before
him
dry
barren
despairing
of
the
fertilisation
for
which
it
longed
and
he
would
lower
his
hat
over
his
forehead
to
protect
himself
against
the
warm
breeze
and
tranquilly
resume
his
reading
his
cassock
raising
behind
him
a
cloudlet
of
dust
which
rolled
along
the
surface
of
the
road
good
morning
monsieur
le
cure
a
passing
peasant
said
to
him
sounds
of
digging
alongside
the
cultivated
strips
of
ground
again
roused
him
from
his
abstraction
he
turned
his
head
and
perceived
big
old
men
greeting
him
from
among
the
vines
the
artauds
were
eagerly
satisfying
their
passion
for
the
soil
in
the
sun
s
full
blaze
sweating
brows
appeared
from
behind
the
bushes
heaving
chests
were
slowly
raised
the
whole
scene
was
one
of
ardent
fructification
through
which
he
moved
with
the
calm
step
born
of
ignorance
no
discomfort
came
to
him
from
the
great
travail
of
love
that
permeated
that
splendid
morning
steady
voriau
you
mustn
t
eat
people
some
one
gaily
shouted
in
a
powerful
voice
by
way
of
silencing
the
dog
s
loud
barks
abbe
mouret
looked
up
oh
it
s
you
fortune
he
said
approaching
the
edge
of
the
field
in
which
the
young
peasant
was
at
work
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
speak
to
fortune
was
of
the
same
age
as
the
priest
a
bigly
built
young
fellow
with
skin
already
hardened
he
was
clearing
a
small
plot
of
stony
heath
what
about
monsieur
le
cure
he
asked
about
rosalie
and
you
replied
the
priest
fortune
began
to
laugh
perhaps
he
thought
it
droll
that
a
priest
should
interest
himself
in
such
a
matter
well
he
muttered
i
m
not
to
blame
in
it
nor
she
either
so
much
the
worse
if
old
bambousse
refuses
to
let
me
have
her
you
saw
yourself
how
his
dog
was
trying
to
bite
me
just
now
he
sets
him
on
then
as
abbe
mouret
was
about
to
continue
old
artaud
called
brichet
whom
he
had
not
previously
perceived
emerged
from
the
shadow
of
a
bush
behind
which
he
and
his
wife
were
eating
he
was
a
little
man
withered
by
age
with
a
cringing
face
your
reverence
must
have
been
told
a
pack
of
lies
he
exclaimed
the
youngster
is
quite
ready
to
marry
rosalie
what
s
happened
isn
t
anybody
s
fault
it
has
happened
to
others
who
got
on
all
right
just
the
same
the
matter
doesn
t
rest
with
us
you
ought
to
speak
to
bambousse
he
s
the
one
who
looks
down
on
us
because
he
s
got
yes
we
are
very
poor
whined
his
wife
a
tall
lachrymose
woman
who
also
rose
to
her
feet
we
ve
only
this
scrap
of
ground
where
the
very
devil
seems
to
have
been
hailing
stones
not
a
bite
of
bread
from
it
even
without
you
your
reverence
life
would
be
brichet
s
wife
was
the
one
solitary
devotee
of
the
village
whenever
she
had
been
to
communion
she
would
hang
about
the
parsonage
well
knowing
that
la
teuse
always
kept
a
couple
of
loaves
for
her
from
her
last
baking
at
times
she
was
even
able
to
carry
off
a
rabbit
or
a
fowl
given
her
by
desiree
there
s
no
end
to
the
scandals
continued
the
priest
the
marriage
must
take
place
without
oh
at
once
as
soon
as
the
others
are
agreeable
said
the
old
woman
alarmed
about
her
periodical
presents
what
do
you
say
brichet
we
are
not
such
bad
christians
as
to
go
against
his
reverence
fortune
sniggered
oh
i
m
quite
ready
he
said
and
so
is
rosalie
i
saw
her
yesterday
at
the
back
of
the
mill
we
haven
t
quarrelled
we
stopped
there
to
have
a
bit
of
a
but
abbe
mouret
interrupted
him
very
well
i
am
now
going
to
speak
to
bambousse
he
is
over
there
at
les
olivettes
i
the
priest
was
going
off
when
the
mother
asked
him
what
had
become
of
her
younger
son
vincent
who
had
left
in
the
early
morning
to
serve
mass
there
was
a
lad
now
who
badly
needed
his
reverence
s
admonitions
and
she
walked
by
the
priest
s
side
for
another
hundred
yards
bemoaning
her
poverty
the
failure
of
the
potato
crop
the
frost
which
had
nipped
the
olive
trees
the
hot
weather
which
threatened
to
scorch
up
the
scanty
corn
then
as
she
left
him
she
solemnly
declared
that
her
son
fortune
always
said
his
prayers
both
morning
and
evening
voriau
now
ran
on
in
front
and
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
the
road
he
bolted
across
the
fields
the
priest
then
struck
into
a
small
path
leading
up
a
low
hill
he
was
now
at
les
olivettes
the
most
fertile
spot
in
the
neighbourhood
where
the
mayor
of
the
commune
artaud
otherwise
bambousse
owned
several
fields
of
corn
olive
plantations
and
vines
the
dog
was
now
romping
round
the
skirts
of
a
tall
brunette
who
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
priest
is
your
father
here
rosalie
the
latter
asked
yes
just
across
there
she
said
pointing
with
her
hand
and
still
smiling
leaving
the
part
of
the
field
she
had
been
weeding
she
walked
on
before
him
with
the
vigorous
springiness
of
a
woman
her
head
unshielded
from
the
sun
her
neck
all
sunburnt
her
hair
black
and
coarse
like
a
horse
s
mane
her
hands
exhaled
the
odour
of
the
weeds
she
had
been
pulling
up
father
she
called
out
here
s
monsieur
le
cure
asking
for
and
there
she
remained
bold
unblushing
with
a
sly
smile
still
hovering
over
her
features
bambousse
a
stout
sweating
man
left
his
work
and
gaily
came
towards
the
priest
i
d
take
my
oath
you
are
going
to
speak
to
me
about
the
repairs
of
the
church
he
exclaimed
as
he
clapped
his
earthy
hands
well
then
monsieur
le
cure
i
can
only
say
no
it
s
impossible
the
commune
hasn
t
got
the
coin
if
the
lord
provides
plaster
and
tiles
we
ll
provide
the
at
this
jest
of
his
the
unbelieving
peasant
burst
into
a
loud
guffaw
slapped
his
thighs
coughed
and
almost
choked
himself
it
was
not
for
the
church
i
came
replied
the
abbe
mouret
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
your
daughter
rosalie
what
has
she
done
to
you
then
inquired
bambousse
his
eyes
blinking
the
girl
was
boldly
staring
at
the
young
priest
scrutinising
his
white
hands
and
slender
feminine
neck
as
if
trying
to
make
him
redden
he
however
bluntly
and
with
unruffled
countenance
as
if
speaking
of
something
quite
indifferent
continued
you
know
what
i
mean
bambousse
she
must
get
oh
that
s
it
is
it
muttered
the
old
man
with
a
bantering
look
many
thanks
for
the
message
the
brichets
sent
you
didn
t
they
mother
brichet
goes
to
mass
and
so
you
give
her
a
helping
hand
to
marry
her
son
it
s
all
very
fine
but
i
ve
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
it
doesn
t
suit
me
that
s
thereupon
the
astonished
priest
represented
to
him
that
the
scandal
must
be
stopped
and
that
he
ought
to
forgive
fortune
as
the
latter
was
willing
to
make
reparation
for
his
transgression
and
that
lastly
his
daughter
s
reputation
demanded
a
speedy
marriage
ta
ta
ta
replied
bambousse
what
a
lot
of
words
i
shall
keep
my
daughter
please
understand
it
all
that
s
got
nothing
to
do
with
me
that
fortune
is
a
beggarly
pauper
without
a
brass
farthing
what
an
easy
job
if
one
could
marry
a
girl
like
that
at
that
rate
we
should
have
all
the
young
things
marrying
off
morning
and
night
thank
heaven
i
m
not
worried
about
rosalie
everybody
knows
what
has
happened
but
it
makes
no
difference
she
can
marry
any
one
she
chooses
in
the
but
the
child
interrupted
the
priest
the
child
indeed
there
ll
be
time
enough
to
think
of
that
when
it
s
rosalie
perceiving
the
turn
the
priest
s
application
was
taking
now
thought
it
proper
to
ram
her
fists
into
her
eyes
and
whimper
and
she
even
let
herself
fall
upon
the
ground
shut
up
will
you
you
hussy
howled
her
father
in
a
rage
and
he
proceeded
to
revile
her
in
the
coarsest
terms
which
made
her
laugh
silently
behind
her
clenched
fists
you
won
t
shut
up
won
t
you
just
wait
a
minute
then
you
jade
continued
old
bambousse
and
thereupon
he
picked
up
a
clod
of
earth
and
flung
it
at
her
it
burst
upon
her
knot
of
hair
crumbling
down
her
neck
and
smothering
her
in
dust
dizzy
from
the
blow
she
bounded
to
her
feet
and
fled
sheltering
her
head
between
her
hands
but
bambousse
had
time
to
fling
two
more
clods
at
her
and
if
the
first
only
grazed
her
left
shoulder
the
next
caught
her
full
on
the
base
of
the
spine
with
such
force
that
she
fell
upon
her
knees
bambousse
cried
the
priest
as
he
wrenched
from
the
peasant
s
hand
a
number
of
stones
which
he
had
just
picked
up
let
be
monsieur
le
cure
said
the
other
it
was
only
soft
earth
i
ought
to
have
thrown
these
stones
at
her
it
s
easy
to
see
that
you
don
t
know
girls
hard
as
nails
all
of
them
i
might
duck
that
one
in
the
well
i
might
break
all
her
bones
with
a
cudgel
and
she
d
still
be
just
the
same
but
i
ve
got
my
eye
on
her
and
if
i
catch
her
ah
well
they
are
all
like
he
was
already
comforted
he
took
a
good
pull
at
a
big
flat
bottle
of
wine
encased
in
which
lay
warming
on
the
hot
ground
and
breaking
once
more
into
a
laugh
he
said
if
i
only
had
a
glass
monsieur
le
cure
i
would
offer
you
some
with
so
then
again
asked
the
priest
this
marriage
no
it
can
t
be
i
should
get
laughed
at
rosalie
is
a
stout
wench
she
s
worth
a
man
to
me
i
shall
have
to
hire
a
lad
the
day
she
goes
off
we
can
have
another
talk
about
it
after
the
vintage
besides
i
don
t
want
to
be
robbed
give
and
take
say
that
s
fair
what
do
you
think
nevertheless
for
another
long
did
the
priest
remain
there
preaching
to
bambousse
speaking
to
him
of
god
and
plying
him
with
all
the
reasons
suited
to
the
circumstances
but
the
old
man
had
resumed
his
work
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
jested
and
grew
more
and
more
obstinate
at
last
he
broke
out
but
if
you
asked
me
for
a
sack
of
corn
you
would
give
me
money
wouldn
t
you
so
why
do
you
want
me
to
let
my
daughter
go
for
nothing
much
discomfited
abbe
mouret
left
him
as
he
went
down
the
path
he
saw
rosalie
rolling
about
under
an
olive
tree
with
voriau
who
was
licking
her
face
with
her
arms
whirling
she
kept
on
repeating
you
tickle
me
you
big
stupid
leave
off
when
she
perceived
the
priest
she
made
an
attempt
at
a
blush
settled
her
clothes
and
once
more
raised
her
fists
to
her
eyes
he
on
his
part
sought
to
console
her
by
promising
to
attempt
some
fresh
efforts
with
her
father
adding
that
in
the
meantime
she
should
do
nothing
to
aggravate
her
sin
and
then
as
she
impudently
smiled
at
him
he
pictured
hell
where
wicked
women
burn
in
torment
and
afterwards
he
left
her
his
duty
done
his
soul
once
more
full
of
the
serenity
which
enabled
him
to
pass
undisturbed
athwart
the
corruptions
of
the
world
vii
the
morning
was
becoming
terribly
hot
in
that
huge
rocky
amphitheatre
the
sun
kindled
a
glare
from
the
moment
when
the
first
fine
weather
began
by
the
planet
s
height
in
the
sky
abbe
mouret
now
perceived
that
he
had
only
just
time
to
return
home
if
he
wished
to
get
there
by
eleven
o
clock
and
escape
a
scolding
from
la
teuse
having
finished
reading
his
breviary
and
made
his
application
to
bambousse
he
swiftly
retraced
his
steps
gazing
as
he
went
at
his
church
now
a
grey
spot
in
the
distance
and
at
the
black
rigid
silhouette
which
the
big
the
solitaire
set
against
the
blue
sky
amidst
the
drowsiness
fostered
by
the
heat
he
thought
of
how
richly
that
evening
he
might
decorate
the
lady
chapel
for
the
devotions
of
the
month
of
mary
before
him
the
road
offered
a
carpet
of
dust
soft
to
the
tread
and
of
dazzling
whiteness
at
the
as
the
abbe
was
about
to
cross
the
highway
leading
from
plassans
to
la
palud
a
gig
coming
down
the
hill
compelled
him
to
step
behind
a
heap
of
stones
then
as
he
crossed
the
open
space
a
voice
called
to
him
hallo
serge
my
boy
the
gig
had
pulled
up
and
from
it
a
man
leant
over
the
priest
recognised
him
he
was
an
uncle
of
his
doctor
pascal
rougon
or
monsieur
pascal
as
the
poor
folk
of
plassans
whom
he
attended
for
nothing
briefly
styled
him
although
barely
over
fifty
he
was
already
snowy
white
with
a
big
beard
and
abundant
hair
amidst
which
his
handsome
regular
features
took
an
expression
of
shrewdness
and
benevolence
see
zola
s
novels
and
fortune
of
the
ed
so
you
potter
about
in
the
dust
at
this
hour
of
the
day
he
said
gaily
as
he
stooped
to
grasp
the
abbe
s
hands
you
re
not
afraid
of
sunstroke
no
more
than
you
are
uncle
answered
the
priest
laughing
oh
i
have
the
hood
of
my
trap
to
shield
me
besides
sick
folks
won
t
wait
people
die
at
all
times
my
and
he
went
on
to
relate
that
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
old
jeanbernat
the
steward
of
the
paradou
who
had
had
an
apoplectic
stroke
the
night
before
a
neighbour
a
peasant
on
his
way
to
plassans
market
had
summoned
him
he
must
be
dead
by
this
time
the
doctor
continued
however
we
must
make
sure
those
old
demons
are
jolly
tough
you
he
was
already
raising
his
whip
when
abbe
mouret
stopped
him
stay
what
o
clock
do
you
make
it
uncle
a
quarter
to
the
abbe
hesitated
he
already
seemed
to
hear
la
teuse
s
terrible
voice
bawling
in
his
ears
that
his
luncheon
was
getting
cold
but
he
plucked
up
courage
and
added
swiftly
i
ll
go
with
you
uncle
the
unhappy
man
may
wish
to
reconcile
himself
to
god
in
his
last
doctor
pascal
could
not
restrain
a
laugh
what
jeanbernat
he
said
ah
well
if
ever
you
convert
him
never
mind
come
all
the
same
the
sight
of
you
is
enough
to
cure
the
priest
got
in
the
doctor
apparently
regretting
his
jest
displayed
an
affectionate
warmth
of
manner
whilst
from
time
to
time
clucking
his
tongue
by
way
of
encouraging
his
horse
and
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
inquisitively
observed
his
nephew
with
the
keenness
of
a
scientist
bent
on
taking
notes
in
short
kindly
sentences
he
inquired
about
his
life
his
habits
and
the
peaceful
happiness
he
enjoyed
at
les
artaud
and
at
each
satisfactory
reply
he
murmured
as
if
to
himself
in
a
tone
of
reassurance
come
so
much
the
better
that
s
just
as
it
should
be
he
displayed
peculiar
anxiety
about
the
young
priest
s
state
of
health
and
serge
greatly
surprised
assured
him
that
he
was
in
splendid
trim
and
had
neither
fits
of
giddiness
or
of
nausea
nor
headaches
whatsoever
capital
capital
reiterated
his
uncle
pascal
in
spring
you
see
the
blood
is
active
but
you
are
sound
enough
i
saw
your
brother
octave
at
marseilles
last
month
he
is
off
to
paris
where
he
will
get
a
fine
berth
in
a
business
the
young
beggar
a
nice
life
he
what
life
innocently
inquired
the
priest
to
avoid
replying
the
doctor
chirruped
to
his
horse
and
then
went
on
briefly
everybody
is
well
your
aunt
felicite
your
uncle
rougon
and
the
others
still
that
does
not
hinder
our
needing
your
prayers
you
are
the
saint
of
the
family
my
lad
i
rely
upon
you
to
save
the
whole
he
laughed
but
in
such
a
friendly
way
that
serge
himself
began
to
indulge
in
jocularity
you
see
continued
pascal
there
are
some
among
the
lot
whom
it
won
t
be
easy
to
lead
to
paradise
some
nice
confessions
you
d
hear
if
all
came
in
turn
for
my
part
i
can
do
without
their
confessions
i
watch
them
from
a
distance
i
have
got
their
records
at
home
among
my
botanical
specimens
and
medical
notes
some
day
i
shall
be
able
to
draw
up
a
wondrously
interesting
diagram
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
he
was
forgetting
himself
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasm
for
science
a
glance
at
his
nephew
s
cassock
pulled
him
up
short
as
for
you
you
re
a
parson
he
muttered
you
did
well
a
parson
s
a
very
happy
man
the
calling
absorbs
you
eh
and
so
you
ve
taken
to
the
good
path
well
you
would
never
have
been
satisfied
otherwise
your
relatives
starting
like
you
have
done
a
deal
of
evil
and
still
they
are
unsatisfied
it
s
all
logically
perfect
my
lad
a
priest
completes
the
family
besides
it
was
inevitable
our
blood
was
bound
to
run
to
that
so
much
the
better
for
you
you
have
had
the
most
correcting
himself
however
with
a
strange
smile
he
added
no
it
s
your
sister
desiree
who
has
had
the
best
luck
of
he
whistled
whipped
up
his
horse
and
changed
the
conversation
the
gig
after
climbing
a
somewhat
steep
slope
was
threading
its
way
through
desolate
ravines
at
last
it
reached
a
tableland
where
the
hollow
road
skirted
an
interminable
and
lofty
wall
les
artaud
had
disappeared
they
found
themselves
in
the
heart
of
a
desert
we
are
getting
near
are
we
not
asked
the
priest
this
is
the
paradou
replied
the
doctor
pointing
to
the
wall
haven
t
you
been
this
way
before
then
we
are
not
three
miles
from
les
artaud
a
splendid
property
it
must
have
been
this
paradou
the
park
wall
this
side
alone
is
quite
a
mile
and
a
half
long
but
for
over
a
hundred
years
it
s
all
been
running
there
are
some
fine
trees
observed
the
abbe
as
he
looked
up
in
astonishment
at
the
luxuriant
mass
of
foliage
which
jutted
over
yes
that
part
is
very
fertile
in
fact
the
park
is
a
regular
forest
amidst
the
bare
rocks
which
surround
it
the
mascle
too
rises
there
i
have
heard
four
or
five
springs
mentioned
i
in
short
sentences
interspersed
with
irrelevant
digressions
he
then
related
the
story
of
the
paradou
according
to
the
current
legend
of
the
countryside
in
the
time
of
louis
a
great
lord
had
erected
a
magnificent
palace
there
with
vast
gardens
fountains
trickling
streams
and
statues
a
miniature
versailles
hidden
away
among
the
stones
under
the
full
blaze
of
the
southern
sun
but
he
had
there
spent
but
one
season
with
a
lady
of
bewitching
beauty
who
doubtless
died
there
as
none
had
ever
seen
her
leave
next
year
the
mansion
was
destroyed
by
fire
the
park
doors
were
nailed
up
the
very
loopholes
of
the
walls
were
filled
with
mould
and
thus
since
that
remote
time
not
a
glance
had
penetrated
that
vast
enclosure
which
covered
the
whole
of
one
of
the
plateaux
of
the
garrigue
hills
there
can
be
no
lack
of
nettles
there
laughingly
said
abbe
mouret
don
t
you
find
that
the
whole
wall
reeks
of
damp
uncle
a
pause
followed
and
he
asked
and
whom
does
the
paradou
belong
to
now
why
nobody
knows
the
doctor
answered
the
owner
did
come
here
once
some
twenty
years
ago
but
he
was
so
scared
by
the
sight
of
this
adders
nest
that
he
has
never
turned
up
since
the
real
master
is
the
caretaker
that
old
oddity
jeanbernat
who
has
managed
to
find
quarters
in
a
lodge
where
the
stones
still
hang
together
there
it
is
see
that
grey
building
yonder
with
its
windows
all
smothered
in
the
gig
passed
by
a
lordly
iron
gate
ruddy
with
rust
and
lined
inside
with
a
layer
of
boards
the
wide
dry
throats
were
black
with
brambles
a
hundred
yards
further
on
was
the
lodge
inhabited
by
jeanbernat
it
stood
within
the
park
which
it
overlooked
but
the
old
keeper
had
apparently
blocked
up
that
side
of
his
dwelling
and
had
cleared
a
little
garden
by
the
road
and
there
he
lived
facing
southwards
with
his
back
turned
upon
the
paradou
as
if
unaware
of
the
immensity
of
verdure
that
stretched
away
behind
him
the
young
priest
jumped
down
looking
inquisitively
around
him
and
questioning
the
doctor
who
was
hurriedly
fastening
the
horse
to
a
ring
fixed
in
the
wall
and
the
old
man
lives
all
alone
in
this
hole
he
asked
yes
quite
alone
replied
his
uncle
adding
however
the
next
minute
well
he
has
with
him
a
niece
whom
he
had
to
take
in
a
queer
girl
a
regular
savage
but
we
must
make
haste
the
whole
place
looks
viii
the
house
with
its
shutters
closed
seemed
wrapped
in
slumber
as
it
stood
there
in
the
midday
sun
amidst
the
hum
of
the
big
flies
that
swarmed
all
up
the
ivy
to
the
roof
tiles
the
sunlit
ruin
was
steeped
in
happy
quietude
when
the
doctor
had
opened
the
gate
of
the
narrow
garden
which
was
enclosed
by
a
lofty
quickset
hedge
there
in
the
shadow
cast
by
a
wall
they
found
jeanbernat
tall
and
erect
and
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
as
in
the
deep
silence
he
watched
his
vegetables
grow
what
are
you
up
then
you
humbug
exclaimed
the
astonished
doctor
so
you
were
coming
to
bury
me
were
you
growled
the
old
man
harshly
i
don
t
want
anybody
i
bled
he
stopped
short
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
priest
and
assumed
so
threatening
an
expression
that
the
doctor
hastened
to
intervene
this
is
my
nephew
he
said
the
new
cure
of
les
artaud
a
good
fellow
too
devil
take
it
we
haven
t
been
bowling
over
the
roads
at
this
hour
of
the
day
to
eat
you
the
old
man
calmed
down
a
little
i
don
t
want
any
shavelings
here
he
grumbled
they
re
enough
to
make
one
croak
mind
doctor
no
priests
and
no
physics
when
i
go
off
or
we
shall
quarrel
let
him
come
in
however
as
he
is
your
abbe
mouret
struck
dumb
with
amazement
could
not
speak
a
word
he
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
path
scanning
that
strange
solitaire
with
scorched
face
and
limbs
all
withered
and
twisted
like
a
bundle
of
ropes
who
seemed
to
bear
the
burden
of
his
eighty
years
with
a
scornful
contempt
for
life
when
the
doctor
attempted
to
feel
his
pulse
his
broke
out
afresh
do
leave
me
in
peace
i
bled
myself
with
my
knife
i
tell
you
it
s
all
over
now
who
was
the
fool
of
a
peasant
who
disturbed
you
the
doctor
here
and
the
priest
as
well
why
not
the
mutes
too
well
it
can
t
be
helped
people
will
be
fools
it
won
t
prevent
us
from
having
a
drink
eh
he
fetched
a
bottle
and
three
glasses
and
stood
them
on
an
old
table
which
he
brought
out
into
the
shade
then
having
filled
the
glasses
to
the
brim
he
insisted
on
clinking
them
his
anger
had
given
place
to
jeering
cheerfulness
it
won
t
poison
you
monsieur
le
cure
he
said
a
glass
of
good
wine
isn
t
a
sin
upon
my
word
however
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
clinked
a
glass
with
a
cassock
but
no
offence
to
you
that
poor
abbe
caffin
your
predecessor
refused
to
argue
with
me
he
was
jeanbernat
gave
vent
to
a
hearty
laugh
and
then
went
on
just
fancy
he
had
pledged
himself
that
he
would
prove
to
me
that
god
exists
so
whenever
i
met
him
i
defied
him
to
do
it
and
he
sloped
off
crestfallen
i
can
tell
what
god
does
not
exist
cried
abbe
mouret
roused
from
his
silence
oh
just
as
you
please
mockingly
replied
jeanbernat
we
ll
begin
together
all
over
again
if
it
s
any
pleasure
to
you
but
i
warn
you
that
i
m
a
tough
hand
at
it
there
are
some
thousands
of
books
in
one
of
the
rooms
upstairs
which
were
rescued
from
the
fire
at
the
paradou
all
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
a
whole
heap
of
old
books
on
religion
i
ve
learned
some
fine
things
from
them
i
ve
been
reading
them
these
twenty
years
marry
you
ll
find
you
ve
got
some
one
who
can
talk
monsieur
le
he
had
risen
slowly
waving
his
hand
towards
the
surrounding
horizon
to
the
earth
and
to
the
sky
and
repeating
solemnly
there
s
nothing
nothing
nothing
when
the
sun
is
snuffed
out
all
will
be
at
an
doctor
pascal
nudged
abbe
mouret
with
his
elbow
with
blinking
eyes
he
was
curiously
observing
the
old
man
and
nodding
approvingly
in
order
to
induce
him
to
talk
so
you
are
a
materialist
jeanbernat
he
said
oh
i
am
only
a
poor
man
replied
the
old
fellow
relighting
his
pipe
when
count
de
corbiere
whose
i
was
died
from
a
fall
from
his
horse
his
children
sent
me
here
to
look
after
this
park
of
the
sleeping
beauty
in
order
to
get
rid
of
me
i
was
sixty
years
old
then
and
i
thought
i
was
about
done
but
death
forgot
me
and
i
had
to
make
myself
a
burrow
if
one
lives
all
alone
look
you
one
gets
to
see
things
in
rather
a
queer
fashion
the
trees
are
no
longer
trees
the
earth
puts
on
the
ways
of
a
living
being
the
stones
seem
to
tell
you
tales
a
parcel
of
rubbish
eh
but
i
know
some
secrets
that
would
fairly
stagger
you
besides
what
do
you
think
there
is
to
do
in
this
devilish
desert
i
read
the
old
books
it
was
more
amusing
than
shooting
the
count
who
used
to
curse
like
a
heathen
was
always
saying
to
me
jeanbernat
my
boy
i
fully
expect
to
meet
you
again
in
the
hot
place
so
that
you
will
be
able
to
serve
me
there
as
you
have
up
once
more
he
waved
his
hand
to
the
horizon
and
added
you
hear
nothing
there
s
nothing
it
s
all
pascal
began
to
laugh
a
pleasant
piece
of
foolery
at
any
rate
he
said
jeanbernat
you
are
a
deceiver
i
suspect
you
are
in
love
in
spite
of
your
affectation
of
being
you
were
speaking
very
tenderly
of
the
trees
and
stones
just
oh
no
i
assure
you
murmured
the
old
man
i
have
done
with
that
at
one
time
it
s
true
when
i
first
knew
you
and
used
to
go
herborising
with
you
i
was
stupid
enough
to
love
all
sorts
of
things
i
came
across
in
that
huge
liar
the
country
fortunately
the
old
volumes
have
killed
all
that
i
only
wish
my
garden
was
smaller
i
don
t
go
out
into
the
road
twice
a
year
you
see
that
bench
that
s
where
i
spend
all
my
time
just
watching
my
lettuces
and
what
about
your
rounds
in
the
park
broke
in
the
doctor
in
the
park
repeated
jeanbernat
with
a
look
of
profound
surprise
why
it
s
more
than
twelve
years
since
i
set
foot
in
it
what
do
you
suppose
i
could
do
inside
that
cemetery
it
s
too
big
it
s
stupid
what
with
those
endless
trees
and
moss
everywhere
and
broken
statues
and
holes
in
which
one
might
break
one
s
neck
at
every
step
the
last
time
i
went
in
there
it
was
so
dark
under
the
trees
there
was
such
a
stink
of
wild
flowers
and
such
queer
breezes
blew
along
the
paths
that
i
felt
almost
afraid
so
i
have
shut
myself
up
to
prevent
the
park
coming
in
here
a
patch
of
sunlight
three
feet
of
lettuce
before
me
and
a
big
hedge
shutting
out
all
the
view
why
that
s
more
than
enough
for
happiness
nothing
that
s
what
i
d
like
nothing
at
all
something
so
tiny
that
nothing
from
outside
could
come
to
disturb
me
seven
feet
of
earth
if
you
like
just
to
be
able
to
croak
on
my
he
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
and
suddenly
raised
his
voice
to
call
out
to
abbe
mouret
come
just
another
glass
your
reverence
the
old
gentleman
isn
t
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
you
the
priest
felt
ill
at
ease
to
lead
back
to
god
that
singular
old
man
whose
reason
seemed
to
him
to
be
strangely
disordered
appeared
a
task
beyond
his
powers
he
now
remembered
certain
bits
of
gossip
he
had
heard
from
la
teuse
about
the
philosopher
as
the
peasants
of
les
artaud
dubbed
jeanbernat
scraps
of
scandalous
stories
vaguely
floated
in
his
memory
he
rose
making
a
sign
to
the
doctor
that
he
wished
to
leave
this
house
where
he
seemed
to
inhale
an
odour
of
damnation
but
in
spite
of
his
covert
fears
a
strange
feeling
of
curiosity
made
him
linger
he
simply
walked
to
the
end
of
the
garden
throwing
a
searching
glance
into
the
vestibule
as
if
to
see
beyond
it
behind
the
walls
all
he
could
perceive
however
through
the
gaping
doorway
was
the
black
staircase
so
he
came
back
again
and
sought
for
some
hole
some
glimpse
of
that
sea
of
foliage
which
he
knew
was
near
by
the
mighty
murmur
that
broke
upon
the
house
like
the
sound
of
waves
and
is
the
little
one
well
asked
the
doctor
taking
up
his
hat
pretty
well
answered
jeanbernat
she
s
never
here
she
often
disappears
all
day
long
still
she
may
be
in
the
upstair
he
raised
his
head
and
called
albine
albine
then
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
added
yes
my
word
she
is
a
nice
hussy
well
till
next
time
monsieur
le
cure
i
m
always
at
your
abbe
mouret
however
had
no
time
to
accept
the
philosopher
s
challenge
a
door
suddenly
opened
at
the
end
of
the
vestibule
a
dazzling
breach
was
made
in
the
black
darkness
of
the
wall
and
through
the
breach
came
a
vision
of
a
virgin
forest
a
great
depth
of
woodland
beneath
a
flood
of
sunbeams
in
that
sudden
blaze
of
light
the
priest
distinctly
perceived
certain
things
a
large
yellow
flower
in
the
middle
of
a
lawn
a
sheet
of
water
falling
from
a
lofty
rock
a
colossal
tree
filled
with
a
swarm
of
birds
and
all
this
steeped
lost
blazing
in
such
a
tangle
of
greenery
such
riotous
luxuriance
of
vegetation
that
the
whole
horizon
seemed
one
great
burst
of
shooting
foliage
the
door
banged
to
and
everything
vanished
ah
the
jade
cried
jeanbernat
she
was
in
the
paradou
again
albine
was
now
laughing
on
the
threshold
of
the
vestibule
she
wore
an
skirt
with
a
large
red
kerchief
fastened
round
her
waist
thus
looking
like
some
gipsy
in
holiday
garb
and
she
went
on
laughing
her
head
thrown
back
her
bosom
swelling
with
mirth
delighted
with
her
flowers
wild
flowers
which
she
had
plaited
into
her
fair
hair
fastened
to
her
neck
her
bodice
and
her
bare
slender
golden
arms
she
seemed
like
a
huge
nosegay
exhaling
a
powerful
perfume
ay
you
are
a
beauty
growled
the
old
man
you
smell
of
weeds
enough
to
poison
one
would
any
one
think
she
was
sixteen
that
doll
albine
remained
unabashed
however
and
laughed
still
more
heartily
doctor
pascal
who
was
her
great
friend
let
her
kiss
him
so
you
are
not
frightened
in
the
paradou
he
asked
frightened
what
of
she
said
her
eyes
wide
open
with
astonishment
the
walls
are
too
high
no
one
can
get
in
there
s
only
myself
it
is
my
garden
all
my
very
own
a
fine
big
one
too
i
haven
t
found
out
where
it
ends
and
the
animals
interrupted
the
doctor
the
animals
oh
they
don
t
hurt
they
all
know
me
but
it
is
very
dark
under
the
trees
course
there
s
shade
if
there
were
none
the
sun
would
burn
my
face
up
it
is
very
pleasant
in
the
shade
among
the
she
flitted
about
filling
the
little
garden
with
the
rustling
sweep
of
her
skirts
and
scattering
round
the
pungent
odour
of
wild
flowers
which
clung
to
her
she
had
smiled
at
abbe
mouret
without
trace
of
shyness
without
heed
of
the
astonished
look
with
which
he
observed
her
the
priest
had
stepped
aside
that
maid
with
long
oval
face
glowing
with
life
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
weird
mysterious
offspring
of
the
forest
of
which
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
in
a
sheet
of
sunlight
i
say
i
have
got
some
blackbird
nestlings
would
you
like
them
albine
asked
the
doctor
no
thanks
he
answered
laughing
you
should
give
them
to
the
cure
s
sister
she
is
very
fond
of
pets
good
day
albine
however
had
fastened
on
the
priest
you
are
the
vicar
of
les
artaud
aren
t
you
you
have
a
sister
i
ll
go
and
see
her
only
you
must
not
speak
to
me
about
god
my
uncle
will
not
have
you
bother
us
be
off
exclaimed
jeanbernat
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
bounding
away
like
a
goat
dropping
a
shower
of
flowers
behind
her
she
disappeared
the
slam
of
a
door
was
heard
and
from
behind
the
house
came
bursts
of
laughter
which
died
away
in
the
distance
like
the
scampering
rush
of
some
mad
animal
let
loose
among
the
grass
you
ll
see
she
will
end
by
sleeping
in
the
paradou
muttered
the
old
man
with
indifference
and
as
he
saw
his
visitors
off
he
added
if
you
should
find
me
dead
one
of
these
fine
days
doctor
just
do
me
the
favour
of
pitching
me
into
the
there
behind
my
lettuces
good
evening
he
let
the
wooden
gate
which
closed
the
hedge
fall
to
again
and
the
house
assumed
once
more
its
aspect
of
happy
peacefulness
in
the
noonday
sunlight
amidst
the
buzzing
of
the
big
flies
that
swarmed
all
up
the
ivy
even
to
the
roof
tiles
ix
the
gig
once
more
rolled
along
the
road
skirting
the
paradou
s
interminable
wall
abbe
mouret
still
silent
scanned
with
upturned
eyes
the
huge
boughs
which
stretched
over
that
wall
like
the
arms
of
giants
hidden
there
all
sorts
of
sounds
came
from
the
park
rustling
of
wings
quivering
of
leaves
furtive
bounds
at
which
branches
snapped
mighty
sighs
that
bowed
the
young
shoots
a
vast
breath
of
life
sweeping
over
the
crests
of
a
nation
of
trees
at
times
as
he
heard
a
birdlike
note
that
seemed
like
a
human
laugh
the
priest
turned
his
head
as
if
he
felt
uneasy
a
queer
girl
said
his
uncle
as
he
eased
the
reins
a
little
she
was
nine
years
old
when
she
took
up
her
quarters
with
that
old
heathen
some
brother
of
his
had
ruined
himself
though
in
what
i
can
t
remember
the
little
one
was
at
school
somewhere
when
her
father
killed
himself
she
was
even
quite
a
little
lady
up
to
reading
embroidery
chattering
and
strumming
on
the
piano
and
such
a
coquette
too
i
saw
her
arrive
with
stockings
embroidered
skirts
frills
cuffs
a
heap
of
finery
ah
well
the
finery
didn
t
last
long
he
laughed
a
big
stone
nearly
upset
the
gig
it
will
be
lucky
if
i
don
t
leave
a
wheel
in
this
cursed
road
he
muttered
hold
on
my
the
wall
still
stretched
beside
them
the
priest
still
listened
as
you
may
well
imagine
continued
the
doctor
the
paradou
what
with
its
sun
its
stones
and
its
thistles
would
wreck
a
whole
outfit
every
day
three
or
four
mouthfuls
that
s
all
it
made
of
all
the
little
one
s
beautiful
dresses
she
used
to
come
back
naked
now
she
dresses
like
a
savage
she
was
rather
presentable
but
sometimes
she
has
scarcely
anything
on
beyond
her
shoes
and
chemise
did
you
hear
her
the
paradou
is
hers
the
very
day
after
she
came
she
took
possession
of
it
she
lives
in
it
jumps
out
of
the
window
when
jeanbernat
locks
the
door
bolts
off
in
spite
of
all
goes
nobody
knows
whither
buries
herself
in
some
invisible
burrows
known
only
to
herself
she
must
have
a
fine
time
in
that
hark
uncle
interrupted
abbe
mouret
isn
t
that
some
animal
running
behind
the
wall
uncle
pascal
listened
no
he
said
after
a
minute
s
silence
it
is
the
rattle
of
the
trap
on
the
stones
no
the
child
doesn
t
play
the
piano
now
i
believe
she
has
even
forgotten
how
to
read
just
picture
to
yourself
a
young
lady
gone
back
to
a
state
of
primevalness
turned
out
to
play
on
a
desert
island
my
word
if
ever
you
get
to
know
of
a
girl
who
needs
proper
bringing
up
i
advise
you
not
to
entrust
her
to
jeanbernat
he
has
a
most
primitive
way
of
letting
nature
alone
when
i
ventured
to
speak
to
him
about
albine
he
answered
me
that
he
must
not
prevent
trees
from
growing
as
they
pleased
he
says
he
is
for
the
normal
development
of
temperaments
all
the
same
they
are
very
interesting
both
of
them
i
never
come
this
way
without
paying
them
a
the
gig
was
now
emerging
from
the
hollowed
road
at
this
point
the
wall
of
the
paradou
turned
and
wound
along
the
crest
of
the
hills
as
far
as
one
could
see
as
abbe
mouret
turned
to
take
a
last
look
at
that
barrier
whose
impenetrable
austerity
had
at
last
begun
to
annoy
him
a
rustling
of
shaken
boughs
was
heard
and
a
clump
of
young
birch
trees
seemed
to
bow
in
greeting
from
above
the
wall
i
knew
some
animal
was
running
behind
said
the
priest
but
although
nobody
could
be
seen
though
nothing
was
visible
in
the
air
above
save
the
birches
rocking
more
and
more
violently
they
heard
a
clear
laughing
voice
call
out
doctor
monsieur
le
cure
i
am
kissing
the
tree
and
the
tree
is
sending
you
my
why
it
is
albine
exclaimed
doctor
pascal
she
must
have
followed
the
trap
at
a
run
jumping
over
bushes
is
mere
play
to
her
the
little
elf
and
he
in
his
turn
shouted
out
my
pet
how
tall
you
must
be
to
bow
like
the
laughter
grew
louder
the
birches
bowed
still
lower
scattering
their
leaves
around
even
on
the
hood
of
the
gig
i
am
as
tall
as
the
trees
all
the
leaves
that
fall
are
kisses
replied
the
voice
now
mellowed
by
distance
so
musical
so
merged
into
the
rippling
whispers
of
the
park
that
the
young
priest
was
thrilled
the
road
grew
better
on
coming
down
the
slope
les
artaud
reappeared
in
the
midst
of
the
scorched
plain
when
the
gig
reached
the
turning
to
the
village
abbe
mouret
would
not
let
his
uncle
drive
him
back
to
the
vicarage
he
jumped
down
saying
no
thanks
i
prefer
to
walk
it
will
do
me
well
just
as
you
like
at
last
answered
the
doctor
and
with
a
clasp
of
the
hand
he
added
well
if
you
only
had
such
parishioners
as
that
old
brute
jeanbernat
you
wouldn
t
often
be
disturbed
however
you
yourself
wanted
to
come
and
mind
you
keep
well
at
the
slightest
ache
night
or
day
send
for
me
you
know
i
attend
all
the
family
gratis
there
my
x
abbe
mouret
felt
more
at
ease
when
he
found
himself
again
alone
walking
along
the
dusty
road
the
stony
fields
brought
him
back
to
his
dream
of
austerity
of
an
inner
life
spent
in
a
desert
from
the
trees
all
along
the
sunken
road
disturbing
moisture
had
fallen
on
his
neck
which
now
the
burning
sun
was
drying
the
sight
of
the
lean
almond
trees
the
scanty
corn
crops
the
weak
vines
on
either
side
of
the
way
soothed
him
delivered
him
from
the
perturbation
into
which
the
lusty
atmosphere
of
the
paradou
had
thrown
him
amid
the
blinding
glare
that
flowed
from
heaven
over
the
bare
land
jeanbernat
s
blasphemies
no
longer
cast
even
a
shadow
a
thrill
of
pleasure
ran
through
the
priest
as
he
raised
his
head
and
caught
sight
of
the
solitaire
s
motionless
silhouette
and
the
pink
patch
of
tiles
on
the
church
but
as
he
walked
on
fresh
anxiety
beset
the
abbe
la
teuse
would
give
him
a
fine
reception
for
his
luncheon
must
have
been
waiting
nearly
two
hours
for
him
he
pictured
her
terrible
face
the
flood
of
words
with
which
she
would
greet
him
the
angry
clatter
of
kitchen
ware
which
he
would
hear
the
whole
afternoon
when
he
had
got
through
les
artaud
his
fear
became
so
lively
that
he
hesitated
full
of
trepidation
and
wondered
if
it
would
not
be
better
to
go
round
and
reach
the
parsonage
by
way
of
the
church
but
while
he
deliberated
la
teuse
herself
appeared
on
the
doorstep
of
the
parsonage
her
cap
all
awry
and
her
hands
on
her
hips
with
drooping
head
he
had
perforce
to
climb
the
slope
under
her
gaze
which
he
could
feel
weighing
upon
his
shoulders
i
believe
i
am
rather
late
my
good
teuse
he
stammered
as
he
turned
the
path
s
last
bend
la
teuse
waited
till
he
stood
quite
close
before
her
she
then
gave
him
a
furious
glance
and
without
a
word
turned
and
stalked
before
him
into
the
banging
her
big
heels
upon
the
and
so
rigid
with
ire
that
she
hardly
limped
at
all
i
have
had
so
many
things
to
do
began
the
priest
scared
by
this
dumb
reception
i
have
been
running
about
all
the
but
she
cut
him
short
with
another
look
so
fixed
so
full
of
anger
that
he
felt
his
legs
give
way
under
him
he
sat
down
and
began
to
eat
she
waited
on
him
in
the
sharp
mechanical
manner
of
an
automaton
all
but
breaking
the
plates
with
the
violence
with
which
she
set
them
down
the
silence
became
so
awful
that
choking
with
emotion
he
was
unable
to
swallow
his
third
mouthful
my
sister
has
had
her
luncheon
he
asked
quite
right
of
her
luncheon
should
always
be
served
whenever
i
am
kept
no
answer
came
la
teuse
stood
there
waiting
to
remove
his
plate
as
soon
as
he
should
have
emptied
it
thereupon
feeling
that
he
could
not
possibly
eat
with
those
implacable
eyes
crushing
him
he
pushed
his
plate
away
this
angry
gesture
acted
on
la
teuse
like
a
whip
stroke
rousing
her
from
her
obstinate
stiffness
she
fairly
jumped
ah
that
s
how
it
is
she
exclaimed
there
you
are
again
losing
your
temper
very
well
i
am
off
you
can
pay
my
fare
so
that
i
may
go
back
home
i
have
had
enough
of
les
artaud
and
your
church
and
everything
else
she
took
off
her
apron
with
trembling
hands
you
must
have
seen
that
i
didn
t
wish
to
say
anything
to
you
a
nice
life
indeed
only
mountebanks
do
such
things
monsieur
le
cure
this
is
eleven
o
clock
ain
t
it
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
sitting
at
table
when
it
s
almost
two
o
clock
it
s
not
like
a
christian
no
it
is
not
like
a
christian
and
taking
her
stand
before
him
she
went
on
well
where
do
you
come
from
whom
have
you
seen
what
business
can
have
kept
you
if
only
you
were
a
child
you
would
have
the
whip
it
isn
t
the
place
for
a
priest
to
be
on
the
roads
in
the
blazing
sun
like
a
tramp
without
a
roof
to
put
over
his
head
a
fine
state
you
are
in
with
your
shoes
all
white
and
your
cassock
smothered
in
dust
who
will
brush
your
cassock
for
you
who
will
buy
you
another
one
speak
out
will
you
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
my
word
if
everybody
didn
t
know
you
they
would
end
by
thinking
queer
things
about
you
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
i
won
t
say
but
what
you
may
have
been
up
to
something
wrong
when
folks
lunch
at
such
hours
they
are
capable
of
anything
abbe
mouret
let
the
storm
blow
over
him
at
the
old
servant
s
wrathful
words
he
experienced
a
kind
of
relief
come
my
good
teuse
he
said
you
will
first
put
your
apron
on
no
no
she
cried
it
s
all
over
i
am
but
he
got
up
and
laughing
tied
her
apron
round
her
waist
she
struggled
against
him
and
stuttered
i
tell
you
no
you
are
a
wheedler
i
can
see
through
your
game
i
see
you
want
to
come
it
over
me
with
your
honeyed
words
where
did
you
go
we
ll
see
he
gaily
sat
down
to
table
again
like
a
man
who
has
gained
a
victory
first
i
must
be
allowed
to
eat
i
am
dying
with
hunger
said
he
no
doubt
she
murmured
her
pity
moved
is
there
any
common
sense
in
it
would
you
like
me
to
fry
you
a
couple
of
eggs
it
would
not
take
long
well
if
you
have
enough
but
everything
is
cold
and
i
had
taken
such
pains
with
your
aubergines
nice
they
are
now
they
look
like
old
luckily
you
haven
t
got
a
tender
tooth
like
poor
monsieur
caffin
yes
you
have
some
good
points
i
don
t
deny
thus
chattering
she
waited
on
him
with
all
a
mother
s
care
after
he
had
finished
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
to
see
if
the
coffee
was
still
warm
she
frisked
about
and
limped
most
outrageously
in
her
delight
at
having
made
things
up
with
him
as
a
rule
abbe
mouret
fought
shy
of
coffee
which
always
upset
his
nervous
system
but
on
this
occasion
to
ratify
the
conclusion
of
peace
he
took
the
cup
she
brought
him
and
as
he
lingered
at
table
she
sat
down
opposite
him
and
repeated
gently
like
a
woman
tortured
by
curiosity
where
have
you
been
monsieur
le
cure
well
he
answered
with
a
smile
i
have
seen
the
brichets
i
have
spoken
to
thereupon
he
had
to
relate
to
her
what
the
brichets
had
said
what
bambousse
had
decided
and
how
they
looked
and
where
they
were
at
work
when
he
repeated
to
her
the
answer
of
rosalie
s
father
of
course
she
exclaimed
if
the
child
should
die
her
mishap
would
go
for
and
clasping
her
hands
with
a
look
of
envious
admiration
she
added
how
you
must
have
chattered
your
reverence
more
than
half
the
day
spent
to
obtain
such
a
fine
result
you
took
it
easy
coming
home
it
must
have
been
very
hot
on
the
road
the
abbe
who
by
this
time
had
risen
made
no
answer
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
speaking
about
the
paradou
and
asking
for
some
information
concerning
it
but
a
fear
of
being
flooded
with
eager
questions
and
a
kind
of
vague
unavowed
shame
made
him
keep
silence
respecting
his
visit
to
jeanbernat
he
cut
all
further
questions
short
by
asking
where
is
my
sister
i
don
t
hear
come
along
sir
said
la
teuse
beginning
to
laugh
and
raising
her
finger
to
her
lips
they
went
into
the
next
room
a
country
hung
with
faded
showing
large
grey
flowers
and
furnished
with
four
armchairs
and
a
sofa
covered
with
on
the
sofa
now
slept
desiree
stretched
out
at
full
length
with
her
head
resting
on
her
clenched
hands
the
pronounced
curve
of
her
bosom
was
raised
somewhat
by
her
upstretched
arms
bare
to
the
elbows
she
was
breathing
somewhat
heavily
her
red
lips
parted
and
thus
showing
her
teeth
lord
isn
t
she
sleeping
sound
whispered
la
teuse
she
didn
t
even
hear
you
pitching
into
me
just
now
well
she
must
be
precious
tired
just
fancy
she
was
cleaning
up
her
yard
till
nearly
noon
and
when
she
had
eaten
something
she
came
and
dropped
down
there
like
a
shot
she
has
not
stirred
for
a
moment
the
priest
gazed
lovingly
at
her
we
must
let
her
have
as
much
rest
as
she
wants
he
said
of
course
isn
t
it
a
pity
she
s
such
an
innocent
just
look
at
those
big
arms
whenever
i
dress
her
i
always
think
what
a
fine
woman
she
would
have
made
ay
she
would
have
brought
you
some
splendid
nephews
sir
don
t
you
think
she
is
like
that
stone
lady
in
plassans
she
spoke
thus
of
a
cybele
stretched
upon
sheaves
of
wheat
the
work
of
one
of
puget
s
pupils
which
was
carved
on
the
frontal
of
the
market
building
without
replying
however
abbe
mouret
gently
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
and
begged
her
to
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
till
evening
therefore
perfect
silence
settled
on
the
parsonage
la
teuse
finished
her
washing
in
the
shed
the
priest
seated
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
garden
his
breviary
fallen
on
his
lap
remained
absorbed
in
pious
thoughts
while
all
around
him
rosy
petals
rained
from
the
blossoming
xi
about
six
o
clock
there
came
a
sudden
wakening
a
noise
of
doors
opening
and
closing
accompanied
by
bursts
of
laughter
shook
the
whole
house
desiree
appeared
her
hair
all
down
and
her
arms
still
half
bare
serge
serge
she
called
and
catching
sight
of
her
brother
in
the
garden
she
ran
up
to
him
and
sat
down
for
a
minute
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
begging
him
to
follow
her
do
come
and
see
the
animals
you
haven
t
seen
the
animals
yet
have
you
if
you
only
knew
how
beautiful
they
are
now
she
had
to
beg
very
hard
for
the
yard
rather
scared
him
but
when
he
saw
tears
in
desiree
s
eyes
he
yielded
she
threw
herself
on
his
neck
in
a
sudden
burst
of
glee
laughing
more
than
ever
without
attempting
to
dry
her
cheeks
oh
how
nice
you
are
she
stammered
as
she
dragged
him
off
you
shall
see
the
hens
the
rabbits
the
pigeons
and
my
ducks
which
have
got
fresh
water
and
my
goat
whose
room
is
as
clean
as
mine
now
i
have
three
geese
and
two
turkeys
you
know
come
quick
you
shall
see
desiree
was
then
years
old
reared
in
the
country
by
her
nurse
a
peasant
woman
of
she
had
grown
up
anyhow
her
brain
void
of
all
serious
thoughts
she
had
thriven
on
the
fat
soil
and
open
air
of
the
country
developing
physically
but
never
mentally
growing
into
a
lovely
animal
white
with
rosy
blood
and
firm
skin
she
was
not
unlike
a
donkey
endowed
with
the
power
of
laughter
although
she
dabbled
about
from
morning
till
night
her
delicate
hands
and
feet
the
supple
outlines
of
her
hips
the
bourgeois
refinement
of
her
maiden
form
remained
unimpaired
so
that
she
was
in
truth
a
creature
apart
neither
lady
nor
peasant
but
a
girl
nourished
by
the
soil
with
the
broad
shoulders
and
narrow
brow
of
a
youthful
goddess
doubtless
it
was
by
reason
of
her
weak
intellect
that
she
was
drawn
towards
animals
she
was
never
happy
save
with
them
she
understood
their
language
far
better
than
that
of
mankind
and
looked
after
them
with
motherly
affection
her
reasoning
powers
were
deficient
but
in
lieu
thereof
she
had
an
instinct
which
put
her
on
a
footing
of
intelligence
with
them
at
their
very
first
cry
of
pain
she
knew
what
ailed
them
she
would
choose
dainties
upon
which
they
would
pounce
greedily
a
single
gesture
from
her
quelled
their
squabbles
she
seemed
to
know
their
good
or
their
evil
character
at
a
glance
and
related
such
long
tales
about
the
tiniest
chick
with
such
an
abundance
and
minuteness
of
detail
as
to
astound
those
to
whom
one
chicken
was
exactly
like
any
other
her
farmyard
had
thus
become
a
country
as
it
were
over
which
she
reigned
a
country
complex
in
its
organisation
disturbed
by
rebellions
peopled
by
the
most
diverse
creatures
whose
records
were
known
to
her
alone
so
accurate
was
her
instinct
that
she
detected
the
unfertile
eggs
in
a
sitting
and
foretold
the
number
of
a
litter
of
rabbits
when
at
sixteen
desiree
became
a
young
woman
she
retained
all
her
wonted
health
and
rapidly
developed
with
round
bust
broad
hips
like
those
of
an
antique
statue
the
full
growth
indeed
of
a
vigorous
animal
one
might
have
thought
that
she
had
sprung
from
the
rich
soil
of
her
that
she
absorbed
the
sap
with
her
sturdy
legs
which
were
as
firm
as
young
trees
and
nought
disturbed
her
amidst
all
this
plenitude
she
found
continuous
satisfaction
in
being
surrounded
by
birds
and
animals
which
ever
increased
and
multiplied
their
fruitfulness
filling
her
with
delight
nothing
could
have
been
healthier
she
innocently
feasted
on
the
odour
and
warmth
of
life
knowing
no
depraved
curiosity
but
retaining
all
the
tranquillity
of
a
beautiful
animal
simply
happy
at
seeing
her
little
world
thus
multiply
feeling
as
if
she
thereby
became
a
mother
the
common
natural
mother
of
one
and
all
since
she
had
been
living
at
les
artaud
she
had
spent
her
days
in
complete
beatitude
at
last
she
was
satisfying
the
dream
of
her
life
the
only
desire
which
had
worried
her
amidst
her
puerility
she
had
a
a
nook
all
to
herself
where
she
could
breed
animals
to
her
heart
s
content
and
she
almost
lived
there
building
with
her
own
hands
digging
out
a
pond
for
the
ducks
knocking
in
nails
fetching
straw
allowing
no
one
to
assist
her
all
that
la
teuse
had
to
do
was
to
wash
her
afterwards
the
was
situated
behind
the
cemetery
and
desiree
often
had
to
jump
the
wall
and
run
hither
and
thither
among
the
graves
after
some
fowl
whom
curiosity
had
led
astray
right
at
the
end
was
a
shed
giving
accommodation
to
the
fowls
and
the
rabbits
to
the
right
was
a
little
stable
for
the
goat
moreover
all
the
animals
lived
together
the
rabbits
ran
about
with
the
fowls
the
would
take
a
footbath
in
the
midst
of
the
ducks
the
geese
the
turkeys
the
and
the
pigeons
all
fraternised
in
the
company
of
three
cats
whenever
desiree
appeared
at
the
wooden
fence
which
prevented
her
charges
from
making
their
way
into
the
church
a
deafening
uproar
greeted
her
eh
can
t
you
hear
them
she
said
to
her
brother
as
they
reached
the
door
but
when
she
had
admitted
him
and
closed
the
gate
behind
them
she
was
assailed
so
violently
that
she
almost
disappeared
the
ducks
and
the
geese
opening
and
shutting
their
beaks
tugged
at
her
skirts
the
greedy
hens
sprang
up
and
pecked
her
hands
the
rabbits
squatted
on
her
feet
and
then
bounded
up
to
her
knees
whilst
the
three
cats
leapt
upon
her
shoulders
and
the
goat
bleated
in
its
stable
at
being
unable
to
reach
her
leave
me
alone
do
all
you
creatures
she
cried
with
a
hearty
sonorous
laugh
feeling
tickled
by
all
the
feathers
claws
and
beaks
and
paws
rubbing
against
her
however
she
did
not
attempt
to
free
herself
as
she
often
said
she
would
have
let
herself
be
devoured
it
seemed
so
sweet
to
feel
all
this
life
cling
to
her
and
encompass
her
with
the
warmth
of
at
last
only
one
cat
persisted
in
remaining
on
her
back
it
s
moumou
she
said
his
paws
are
like
then
calling
her
brother
s
attention
to
the
yard
she
proudly
added
see
how
clean
it
is
the
yard
had
indeed
been
swept
out
washed
and
raked
over
but
the
disturbed
water
and
the
litter
exhaled
so
fetid
and
powerful
an
odour
that
abbe
mouret
half
choked
the
dung
was
heaped
against
the
graveyard
wall
in
a
huge
smoking
mound
what
a
pile
eh
continued
desiree
leading
her
brother
into
the
pungent
vapour
i
put
it
all
there
myself
nobody
helped
me
go
on
it
isn
t
dirty
it
cleans
look
at
my
as
she
spoke
she
held
out
her
arms
which
she
had
merely
dipped
into
a
pail
of
water
regal
arms
they
were
superbly
rounded
blooming
like
full
white
roses
amidst
the
manure
yes
yes
gently
said
the
priest
you
have
worked
hard
it
s
very
nice
then
he
turned
towards
the
wicket
but
she
stopped
him
do
wait
a
bit
you
shall
see
them
all
you
have
no
idea
and
so
saying
she
dragged
him
to
the
rabbit
house
under
the
shed
there
are
young
ones
in
all
the
hutches
she
said
clapping
her
hands
in
glee
then
at
great
length
she
proceeded
to
explain
to
him
all
about
the
litters
he
had
to
crouch
down
and
come
close
to
the
wire
netting
whilst
she
gave
him
minute
details
the
mother
does
with
big
restless
ears
eyed
him
askance
panting
and
motionless
with
fear
then
in
one
hutch
he
saw
a
hairy
cavity
wherein
crawled
a
living
heap
an
indistinct
dusky
mass
heaving
like
a
single
body
close
by
some
young
ones
with
enormous
heads
ventured
to
the
edge
of
the
hole
a
little
farther
were
yet
stronger
ones
who
looked
like
young
rats
ferreting
and
leaping
about
with
their
raised
rumps
showing
their
white
scuts
others
white
ones
with
pale
ruby
eyes
and
black
ones
with
jet
eyes
galloped
round
their
hutches
with
playful
grace
now
a
scare
would
make
them
bolt
off
swiftly
revealing
at
every
leap
their
slender
reddened
paws
next
they
would
squat
down
all
in
a
heap
so
closely
packed
that
their
heads
could
no
longer
be
seen
it
is
you
they
are
frightened
at
desiree
kept
on
saying
they
know
me
she
called
them
and
drew
some
from
her
pocket
the
little
rabbits
then
became
more
confident
and
with
puckered
noses
kept
sidling
up
and
rearing
against
the
netting
one
by
one
she
kept
them
like
that
for
a
minute
to
show
her
brother
the
rosy
down
upon
their
bellies
and
then
gave
her
crust
to
the
boldest
one
upon
this
the
whole
of
them
flocked
up
sliding
forward
and
squeezing
one
another
but
never
quarreling
at
one
moment
three
little
ones
were
all
nibbling
the
same
piece
of
crust
but
others
darted
away
turning
to
the
wall
so
as
to
eat
in
peace
while
their
mothers
in
the
rear
remained
snuffing
distrustfully
and
refused
the
crusts
oh
the
greedy
little
things
exclaimed
desiree
they
would
eat
like
that
till
morning
at
night
even
you
can
bear
them
crunching
the
leaves
they
have
overlooked
in
the
the
priest
had
risen
as
if
to
depart
but
she
never
wearied
of
smiling
on
her
dear
little
ones
you
see
the
big
one
there
that
s
all
white
with
black
ears
well
he
dotes
on
poppies
he
is
very
clever
at
picking
them
out
from
the
other
weeds
the
other
day
he
got
the
colic
so
i
took
him
and
kept
him
warm
in
my
pocket
since
then
he
has
been
quite
she
poked
her
fingers
through
the
wire
netting
and
stroked
the
rabbits
backs
wouldn
t
you
say
it
was
satin
she
continued
they
are
dressed
like
princes
and
ain
t
they
coquettish
look
there
s
one
who
is
always
cleaning
himself
he
wears
the
fur
off
his
paws
if
only
you
knew
how
funny
they
are
i
say
nothing
but
i
see
all
their
little
games
that
grey
one
looking
at
us
for
instance
used
to
hate
a
little
doe
which
i
had
to
put
somewhere
else
there
were
terrible
scenes
between
them
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
all
but
the
last
time
he
gave
her
a
drubbing
when
i
came
up
in
a
rage
what
do
you
think
i
saw
why
that
rascal
huddled
up
at
the
back
there
as
if
he
was
just
at
his
last
gasp
he
wanted
to
make
me
believe
that
it
was
he
who
had
to
complain
of
then
desiree
paused
to
apostrophise
the
rabbit
yes
you
may
listen
to
me
you
re
a
rogue
and
turning
towards
her
brother
he
understands
all
i
say
she
added
softly
with
a
wink
but
abbe
mouret
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
was
perturbed
by
the
heat
that
emanated
from
the
litters
the
life
that
crawled
under
the
hair
plucked
from
the
does
bellies
exhaling
powerful
emanations
on
the
other
hand
desiree
as
if
slowly
intoxicated
was
growing
brighter
and
pinker
but
there
s
nothing
to
take
you
away
she
cried
you
always
seem
anxious
to
go
off
you
must
see
my
little
chicks
they
were
born
last
she
took
some
rice
and
threw
a
handful
before
her
the
hen
gravely
drew
near
clucking
to
the
little
band
of
chickens
that
followed
her
chirping
and
scampering
as
if
in
bewilderment
when
they
were
fairly
in
the
middle
of
the
scattered
rice
the
hen
eagerly
pecked
at
it
and
threw
down
the
grains
she
cracked
while
her
little
ones
hastily
began
to
feed
all
the
charm
of
infancy
was
theirs
as
it
were
with
round
heads
eyes
sparkling
like
steel
needles
beaks
so
queerly
set
and
down
so
quaintly
ruffled
up
they
looked
like
penny
toys
desiree
laughed
with
enjoyment
at
sight
of
them
what
little
loves
they
are
she
stammered
she
took
up
two
of
them
one
in
each
hand
and
smothered
them
with
eager
kisses
and
then
the
priest
had
to
inspect
them
all
over
while
she
coolly
said
to
him
it
isn
t
easy
to
tell
the
cocks
but
i
never
make
a
mistake
this
one
is
a
hen
and
this
one
is
a
hen
then
she
set
them
on
the
ground
again
other
hens
were
now
coming
up
to
eat
the
rice
a
large
ruddy
cock
with
flaming
plumage
followed
them
lifting
his
large
feet
with
majestic
caution
alexander
is
getting
splendid
said
the
abbe
to
please
his
sister
alexander
was
the
cock
s
name
he
looked
up
at
the
young
girl
with
his
fiery
eye
his
head
turned
round
his
tail
outspread
and
then
installed
himself
close
by
her
skirts
he
is
very
fond
of
me
she
said
only
i
can
touch
him
he
is
a
good
bird
there
are
fourteen
hens
and
never
do
i
find
a
bad
egg
in
the
nests
do
i
alexander
she
stooped
the
bird
did
not
fly
from
her
caress
a
rush
of
blood
seemed
to
set
his
comb
aflame
flapping
his
wings
and
stretching
out
his
neck
he
burst
into
a
long
crow
which
rang
out
like
a
blast
from
a
brazen
throat
four
times
did
he
repeat
his
crow
while
all
the
cocks
of
les
artaud
answered
in
the
distance
desiree
was
greatly
amused
by
her
brother
s
startled
looks
he
deafens
one
eh
she
said
he
has
a
splendid
voice
but
he
s
not
vicious
i
assure
you
though
the
hens
are
you
remember
the
big
speckled
one
that
used
to
lay
yellow
eggs
well
the
day
before
yesterday
she
hurt
her
foot
when
the
others
saw
the
blood
they
went
quite
mad
they
all
followed
her
pecking
at
her
and
drinking
her
blood
so
that
by
the
evening
they
had
eaten
up
her
foot
i
found
her
with
her
head
behind
a
stone
like
an
idiot
saying
nothing
and
letting
herself
be
the
remembrance
of
the
fowls
voracity
made
her
laugh
she
calmly
related
other
cruelties
of
theirs
young
chickens
devoured
of
which
she
had
only
found
the
necks
and
wings
and
a
litter
of
kittens
eaten
up
in
the
stable
in
a
few
hours
you
might
give
them
a
human
being
she
continued
they
d
finish
him
and
aren
t
they
tough
livers
they
get
on
with
a
broken
limb
even
they
may
have
wounds
big
holes
in
their
bodies
and
still
they
ll
gobble
their
victuals
that
s
what
i
like
them
for
their
flesh
grows
again
in
two
days
they
are
always
as
warm
as
if
they
had
a
store
of
sunshine
under
their
feathers
when
i
want
to
give
them
a
treat
i
cut
them
up
some
raw
meat
and
worms
too
wait
you
ll
see
how
they
love
she
ran
to
the
dungheap
and
unhesitatingly
picked
up
a
worm
she
found
there
the
fowls
darted
at
her
hands
but
to
amuse
herself
with
the
sight
of
their
greediness
she
held
the
worm
high
above
them
at
last
she
opened
her
fingers
and
forthwith
the
fowls
hustled
one
another
and
pounced
upon
the
worm
one
of
them
fled
with
it
in
her
beak
pursued
by
the
others
it
was
thus
taken
snatched
away
and
retaken
many
times
until
one
hen
with
a
mighty
gulp
swallowed
it
altogether
at
that
they
all
stopped
short
with
heads
thrown
back
and
eyes
on
the
alert
for
another
worm
desiree
called
them
by
their
names
and
talked
pettingly
to
them
while
abbe
mouret
retreated
a
few
steps
from
this
display
of
voracious
life
no
i
am
not
at
all
comfortable
he
said
to
his
sister
when
she
tried
to
make
him
feel
the
weight
of
a
fowl
she
was
fattening
it
always
makes
me
uneasy
to
touch
live
he
tried
to
smile
but
desiree
taxed
him
with
cowardice
ah
well
what
about
my
ducks
and
geese
and
turkeys
said
she
what
would
you
do
if
you
had
all
those
to
look
after
ducks
are
dirty
if
you
like
do
you
hear
them
shaking
their
bills
in
the
water
and
when
they
dive
you
can
only
see
their
tails
sticking
straight
up
like
ninepins
geese
and
turkeys
too
are
not
easy
to
manage
isn
t
it
fun
to
see
them
walking
along
with
their
long
necks
some
quite
white
and
others
quite
black
they
look
like
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
i
wouldn
t
advise
you
to
trust
your
finger
to
them
they
would
swallow
it
at
a
gulp
but
my
fingers
they
only
kiss
see
her
words
were
cut
short
by
a
joyous
bleat
from
the
goat
which
had
at
last
forced
the
door
of
the
stable
open
two
bounds
and
the
animal
was
close
to
her
bending
its
forelegs
and
affectionately
rubbing
its
horns
against
her
to
the
priest
with
its
pointed
beard
and
obliquely
set
eyes
it
seemed
to
wear
a
diabolical
grin
but
desiree
caught
it
round
the
neck
kissed
its
head
played
and
ran
with
it
and
talked
about
how
she
liked
to
drink
its
milk
she
often
did
so
she
said
when
she
was
thirsty
in
the
stable
see
it
has
plenty
of
milk
she
added
pointing
to
the
animal
s
udder
the
priest
lowered
his
eyes
he
could
remember
having
once
seen
in
the
cloister
of
at
plassans
a
horrible
stone
gargoyle
representing
a
goat
and
a
monk
and
ever
since
he
had
always
looked
on
goats
as
dissolute
creatures
of
hell
his
sister
had
only
been
allowed
to
get
one
after
weeks
of
begging
for
his
part
whenever
he
came
to
the
yard
he
shunned
all
contact
with
the
animal
s
long
silky
coat
and
carefully
guarded
his
cassock
from
the
touch
of
its
horns
all
right
i
ll
let
you
go
now
said
desiree
becoming
aware
of
his
growing
discomfort
but
you
must
just
let
me
show
you
something
else
first
promise
not
to
scold
me
won
t
you
i
have
not
said
anything
to
you
about
it
because
you
wouldn
t
have
allowed
it
but
if
you
only
knew
how
pleased
i
am
as
she
spoke
she
put
on
an
entreating
expression
clasped
her
hands
and
laid
her
head
upon
her
brother
s
shoulder
another
piece
of
folly
no
doubt
he
murmured
unable
to
refrain
from
smiling
you
won
t
mind
will
you
she
continued
her
eyes
glistening
with
delight
you
won
t
be
angry
he
is
so
pretty
thereupon
she
ran
to
open
the
low
door
under
the
shed
and
forthwith
a
little
pig
bounded
into
the
middle
of
the
yard
oh
isn
t
he
a
cherub
she
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
profound
rapture
as
she
saw
him
leap
out
the
little
pig
was
indeed
charming
quite
pink
his
snout
washed
clean
by
the
greasy
slops
placed
before
him
though
incessant
routing
in
his
trough
had
left
a
ring
of
dirt
about
his
eyes
he
trotted
about
hustled
the
fowls
rushing
to
gobble
up
whatever
was
thrown
them
and
upsetting
the
little
yard
with
his
sudden
turns
and
twists
his
ears
flapped
over
his
eyes
his
snout
went
snorting
over
the
ground
and
with
his
slender
feet
he
resembled
a
toy
animal
on
wheels
from
behind
his
tail
looked
like
a
bit
of
string
that
served
to
hang
him
up
by
i
won
t
have
this
beast
here
exclaimed
the
priest
terribly
put
out
oh
serge
dear
old
serge
begged
desiree
again
don
t
be
so
unkind
see
what
a
harmless
little
thing
he
is
i
ll
wash
him
i
ll
keep
him
very
clean
la
teuse
went
and
had
him
given
her
for
me
we
can
t
send
him
back
now
see
he
is
looking
at
you
he
wants
to
smell
you
don
t
be
afraid
he
won
t
eat
but
she
broke
off
seized
with
irresistible
laughter
the
little
pig
had
blundered
in
a
dazed
fashion
between
the
goat
s
legs
and
tripped
her
up
and
he
was
now
madly
careering
round
squeaking
rolling
scaring
all
the
denizens
of
the
to
quiet
him
desiree
had
to
get
him
an
earthen
pan
full
of
in
this
he
wallowed
up
to
his
ears
splashing
and
grunting
while
quick
quivers
of
delight
coursed
over
his
rosy
skin
and
now
his
uncurled
tail
hung
limply
down
the
stirring
of
this
foul
water
put
a
crowning
touch
to
abbe
mouret
s
disgust
ever
since
he
had
been
there
he
had
choked
more
and
more
his
hands
and
chest
and
face
were
afire
and
he
felt
quite
giddy
the
odour
of
the
fowls
and
rabbits
the
goat
and
the
pig
all
mingled
in
one
pestilential
stench
the
atmosphere
laden
with
the
ferments
of
life
was
too
heavy
for
his
maiden
shoulders
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
desiree
had
grown
taller
expanding
at
the
hips
waving
huge
arms
sweeping
the
ground
with
her
skirts
and
stirring
up
all
that
powerful
odour
which
overpowered
him
he
had
only
just
time
to
open
the
wicket
his
feet
clung
to
the
stone
flags
still
dank
with
manure
in
such
wise
that
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
held
there
by
some
clasp
of
the
soil
and
suddenly
despite
himself
there
came
back
to
him
a
memory
of
the

to
him
as
she
joined
him
outside
the
wicket
aren

you
pleased
to
have
seen
everything
do
you
hear
the
noise
they
are
making
on
seeing
her
depart
the
birds
and
animals
had
thrown
themselves
against
the
trellis
work
emitting
piteous
cries
the
little
pig
especially
gave
vent
to
prolonged
whines
that
suggested
the
sharpening
of
a
saw
desiree
however
curtsied
to
them
and
kissed
her
to
them
laughing
at
seeing
them
all
huddled
together
there
like
so
many
lovers
of
hers
then
hugging
her
brother
as
she
accompanied
him
to
the
garden
she
whispered
into
his
ear
with
a
blush
i
should
so
like
a
he
looked
at
her
with
a
ready
gesture
of
disapproval
no
no
not
now
she
hurriedly
went
on
we
ll
talk
about
it
again
later
on
but
there
would
be
room
in
the
stable
a
lovely
white
cow
with
red
spots
you
d
soon
see
what
nice
milk
we
should
have
a
goat
becomes
too
little
in
the
end
and
when
the
cow
has
a
calf
at
the
mere
thought
of
this
she
skipped
and
clapped
her
hands
with
glee
and
to
the
priest
she
seemed
to
have
brought
the
away
with
her
in
her
skirts
so
he
left
her
at
the
end
of
the
garden
sitting
in
the
sunlight
on
the
ground
before
a
hive
whence
the
bees
buzzed
like
golden
berries
round
her
neck
along
her
bare
arms
and
in
her
hair
without
thought
of
stinging

brother
archangias
dined
at
the
parsonage
every
thursday
as
a
rule
he
came
early
so
as
to
talk
over
parish
matters
it
was
he
who
for
the
last
three
months
had
kept
the
abbe
informed
of
all
the
affairs
of
the
valley
that
thursday
while
waiting
till
la
teuse
should
call
them
they
strolled
about
in
front
of
the
church
the
priest
on
relating
his
interview
with
bambousse
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
brother
thought
the
peasant
s
reply
quite
natural
the
man
s
right
said
the
ignorantin
you
don
t
give
away
chattels
like
that
rosalie
is
no
great
bargain
but
it
s
always
hard
to
see
your
own
daughter
throw
herself
away
on
a
a
popular
name
in
france
for
a
christian
ed
still
rejoined
abbe
mouret
a
marriage
is
the
only
way
of
stopping
the
the
brother
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
and
laughed
aggravatingly
do
you
think
you
ll
cure
the
neighbourhood
with
that
marriage
he
exclaimed
before
another
two
years
catherine
will
be
following
her
sister
s
example
they
all
go
the
same
way
and
as
they
end
by
marrying
they
snap
their
fingers
at
every
one
these
artauds
flourish
in
it
all
as
on
a
congenial
dungheap
there
is
only
one
possible
remedy
as
i
have
told
you
before
wring
all
the
girls
necks
if
you
don
t
want
the
country
to
be
poisoned
no
husbands
monsieur
le
cure
but
a
good
thick
stick
then
calming
down
a
bit
he
added
let
every
one
do
with
their
own
as
they
think
he
went
on
to
speak
about
fixing
the
hours
for
the
catechism
classes
but
abbe
mouret
replied
in
an
way
his
eyes
dwelling
on
the
village
at
his
feet
in
the
setting
sun
the
peasants
were
wending
their
way
homewards
silently
and
slowly
with
the
dragging
steps
of
wearied
oxen
returning
to
their
sheds
before
the
houses
stood
women
calling
to
one
another
carrying
on
bawling
conversations
from
door
to
door
while
bands
of
children
filled
the
roadway
with
the
riot
of
their
big
clumsy
shoes
grovelling
and
rolling
and
pushing
each
other
about
a
bestial
odour
ascended
from
that
heap
of
tottering
houses
and
the
priest
once
more
fancied
himself
in
desiree
s
where
life
ever
increased
and
multiplied
here
too
was
the
same
incessant
travail
which
so
disturbed
him
since
morning
his
mind
had
been
running
on
that
episode
of
rosalie
and
fortune
and
now
his
thoughts
returned
to
it
to
the
foul
features
of
existence
the
incessant
fated
task
of
nature
which
sowed
men
broadcast
like
grains
of
wheat
the
artauds
were
a
herd
penned
in
between
four
ranges
of
hills
increasing
multiplying
spreading
more
and
more
thickly
over
the
land
with
each
successive
generation
see
cried
brother
archangias
interrupting
his
discourse
to
point
to
a
tall
girl
who
was
letting
her
sweetheart
snatch
a
kiss
there
is
another
hussy
over
there
he
shook
his
long
black
arms
at
the
couple
and
made
them
flee
in
the
distance
over
the
crimson
fields
and
the
peeling
rocks
the
sun
was
dying
in
one
last
flare
night
gradually
came
on
the
warm
fragrance
of
the
lavender
became
cooler
on
the
wings
of
the
light
evening
breeze
which
now
arose
from
time
to
time
a
deep
sigh
fell
on
the
ear
as
if
that
fearful
land
consumed
by
ardent
passions
had
at
length
grown
calm
under
the
soft
grey
rain
of
twilight
abbe
mouret
hat
in
hand
delighted
with
the
coolness
once
more
felt
quietude
descend
upon
him
monsieur
le
cure
brother
archangias
cried
la
teuse
come
quick
the
soup
is
on
the
it
was
cabbage
soup
and
its
odoriferous
steam
filled
the
parsonage
the
brother
seated
himself
and
fell
to
slowly
emptying
the
huge
plate
that
la
teuse
had
put
down
before
him
he
was
a
big
eater
and
clucked
his
tongue
as
each
mouthful
descended
audibly
into
his
stomach
keeping
his
eyes
on
his
spoon
he
did
not
speak
a
word
isn
t
my
soup
good
then
monsieur
le
cure
the
old
servant
asked
the
priest
you
are
only
fiddling
with
your
i
am
not
a
bit
hungry
my
good
teuse
serge
replied
smiling
well
how
can
one
wonder
at
it
when
you
go
on
as
you
do
but
you
would
have
been
hungry
if
you
hadn
t
lunched
at
past
two
o
brother
archangias
tilting
into
his
spoon
the
last
few
drops
of
soup
remaining
in
his
plate
said
gravely
you
should
be
regular
in
your
meals
monsieur
le
at
this
moment
desiree
who
also
had
finished
her
soup
sedately
and
in
silence
rose
and
followed
la
teuse
to
the
kitchen
the
brother
then
left
alone
with
abbe
mouret
cut
himself
some
long
strips
of
bread
which
he
ate
while
waiting
for
the
next
dish
so
you
made
a
long
round
he
asked
the
priest
but
before
the
other
could
reply
a
noise
of
footsteps
exclamations
and
ringing
laughter
arose
at
the
end
of
the
passage
in
the
direction
of
the
yard
a
short
altercation
apparently
took
place
a
voice
which
disturbed
the
abbe
rose
in
vexed
and
hurried
accents
which
finally
died
away
in
a
burst
of
glee
what
can
it
be
said
serge
rising
from
his
chair
but
desiree
bounded
in
again
carrying
something
hidden
in
her
skirt
and
she
burst
out
excitedly
isn
t
she
queer
she
wouldn
t
come
in
at
all
i
caught
hold
of
her
dress
but
she
is
awfully
strong
she
soon
got
away
from
whom
on
earth
is
she
talking
about
asked
la
teuse
running
in
from
the
kitchen
with
a
dish
of
potatoes
across
which
lay
a
piece
of
bacon
the
girl
sat
down
and
with
the
greatest
caution
drew
from
her
skirt
a
blackbird
s
nest
in
which
three
wee
fledglings
were
slumbering
she
laid
it
on
her
plate
the
moment
the
little
birds
felt
the
light
they
stretched
out
their
feeble
necks
and
opened
their
crimson
beaks
to
ask
for
food
desiree
clapped
her
hands
enchanted
seized
with
strange
emotion
at
the
sight
of
these
hitherto
unknown
creatures
it
s
that
paradou
girl
exclaimed
the
abbe
suddenly
remembering
everything
la
teuse
had
gone
to
the
window
so
it
is
she
said
i
might
have
known
that
grasshopper
s
voice
oh
the
gipsy
look
she
s
stopped
there
to
spy
on
abbe
mouret
drew
near
he
too
thought
that
he
could
see
albine
s
skirt
behind
a
juniper
bush
but
brother
archangias
in
a
towering
passion
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
behind
him
and
stretching
out
his
fist
and
wagging
his
churlish
head
thundered
forth
may
the
devil
take
you
you
brigand
s
daughter
i
will
drag
you
right
round
the
church
by
your
hair
if
ever
i
catch
you
coming
and
casting
your
evil
spells
here
a
peal
of
laughter
fresh
as
the
breath
of
night
rang
out
from
the
path
followed
by
light
hasty
footsteps
and
the
swish
of
a
dress
rustling
through
the
grass
like
an
adder
abbe
mouret
standing
at
the
window
saw
something
golden
glide
through
the
pine
trees
like
a
moonbeam
the
breeze
wafted
in
from
the
open
country
was
now
laden
with
that
penetrating
perfume
of
verdure
that
scent
of
wildflowers
which
albine
had
scattered
from
her
bare
arms
unfettered
bosom
and
streaming
tresses
at
the
paradou
an
accursed
soul
a
child
of
perdition
growled
brother
archangias
as
he
reseated
himself
at
the
dinner
table
he
fell
greedily
upon
his
bacon
and
swallowed
his
potatoes
whole
instead
of
bread
la
teuse
however
could
not
persuade
desiree
to
finish
her
dinner
that
big
baby
was
lost
in
ecstasy
over
the
nestlings
asking
questions
wanting
to
know
what
food
they
ate
if
they
laid
eggs
and
how
the
cockbirds
could
be
known
the
old
servant
however
was
troubled
by
a
suspicion
and
taking
her
stand
on
her
sound
leg
she
looked
the
young
cure
in
the
face
so
you
know
the
paradou
people
she
said
thereupon
he
simply
told
the
truth
relating
the
visit
he
had
paid
to
old
jeanbernat
la
teuse
exchanged
scandalised
glances
with
brother
archangias
at
first
she
answered
nothing
but
went
round
and
round
the
table
limping
frantically
and
stamping
hard
enough
with
her
heels
to
split
the
flooring
you
might
have
spoken
to
me
of
those
people
these
three
months
past
said
the
priest
at
last
i
should
have
known
at
any
rate
what
sort
of
people
i
was
going
to
call
la
teuse
stopped
short
as
if
her
legs
had
just
broken
don
t
tell
falsehoods
monsieur
le
cure
she
stuttered
don
t
tell
them
you
will
only
make
your
sin
still
worse
how
dare
you
say
i
haven
t
spoken
to
you
of
the
philosopher
that
heathen
who
is
the
scandal
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
the
truth
is
you
never
listen
to
me
when
i
talk
it
all
goes
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
ah
if
you
did
listen
to
me
you
d
spare
yourself
a
good
deal
of
trouble
i
too
have
spoken
to
you
about
those
abominations
affirmed
the
brother
abbe
mouret
lightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
i
didn
t
remember
it
he
said
it
was
only
when
i
found
myself
at
the
paradou
that
i
fancied
i
recollected
certain
tales
besides
i
should
have
gone
to
that
unhappy
man
all
the
same
as
i
thought
him
in
danger
of
brother
archangias
his
mouth
full
struck
the
table
violently
with
his
knife
and
roared
jeanbernat
is
a
dog
he
ought
to
die
like
a
then
seeing
the
priest
about
to
protest
he
cut
him
short
no
no
for
him
there
is
no
god
no
penitence
no
mercy
it
would
be
better
to
throw
the
host
to
the
pigs
than
carry
it
to
that
then
he
helped
himself
to
more
potatoes
and
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
his
chin
in
his
plate
began
chewing
furiously
la
teuse
her
lips
pinched
quite
white
with
anger
contented
herself
with
saying
dryly
let
it
be
his
reverence
will
have
his
own
way
he
has
secrets
from
us
silence
reigned
for
a
moment
one
only
heard
the
working
of
brother
archangias
s
jaws
and
the
extraordinary
rumbling
of
his
gullet
desiree
with
her
bare
arms
round
the
nest
in
her
plate
smiled
to
the
little
ones
talking
to
them
slowly
and
softly
in
a
chirruping
of
her
own
which
they
seemed
to
understand
people
say
what
they
have
done
when
they
have
nothing
to
hide
suddenly
cried
la
teuse
and
then
silence
reigned
again
what
exasperated
the
old
servant
was
the
mystery
the
priest
seemed
to
make
about
his
visit
to
the
paradou
she
deemed
herself
a
woman
who
had
been
shamefully
deceived
her
curiosity
smarted
she
again
walked
round
the
table
not
looking
at
the
abbe
not
addressing
anybody
but
comforting
herself
with
soliloquy
that
s
it
that
s
why
we
have
lunch
so
late
we
go
gadding
about
till
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
we
go
into
such
disreputable
houses
that
we
don
t
even
dare
to
tell
what
we
ve
done
and
then
we
tell
lies
we
deceive
but
nobody
gently
interrupted
abbe
mouret
who
was
forcing
himself
to
eat
a
little
more
so
as
to
prevent
la
teuse
from
getting
crosser
than
ever
nobody
asked
me
if
i
had
been
to
the
paradou
i
have
not
had
to
tell
any
la
teuse
however
went
on
as
if
she
had
never
heard
him
yes
we
go
ruining
our
cassock
in
the
dust
we
come
home
rigged
up
like
a
thief
and
if
some
kind
person
takes
an
interest
in
us
and
questions
us
for
our
own
good
we
push
her
about
and
treat
her
like
a
woman
whom
we
can
t
trust
we
hide
things
like
a
slyboots
we
d
rather
die
than
breathe
a
word
we
re
not
even
considerate
enough
to
enliven
our
home
by
relating
what
we
ve
she
turned
to
the
priest
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
yes
you
take
that
to
yourself
you
are
a
close
one
you
re
a
bad
man
thereupon
she
fell
to
crying
and
the
abbe
had
to
soothe
her
monsieur
caffin
used
to
tell
me
everything
she
moaned
out
however
she
soon
grew
calmer
brother
archangias
was
finishing
a
big
piece
of
cheese
apparently
quite
unruffled
by
the
scene
in
his
opinion
abbe
mouret
really
needed
being
kept
straight
and
la
teuse
was
right
in
making
him
feel
the
reins
having
drunk
a
last
glassful
of
the
weak
wine
the
brother
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
to
digest
his
meal
well
now
finally
asked
the
old
servant
what
did
you
see
at
the
paradou
tell
us
at
any
abbe
mouret
smiled
and
related
in
a
few
words
how
strangely
jeanbernat
had
received
him
la
teuse
after
overwhelming
him
with
questions
broke
out
into
indignant
exclamations
while
brother
archangias
clenched
his
fists
and
brandished
them
aloft
may
heaven
crush
him
said
he
and
burn
both
him
and
his
witch
in
his
turn
the
abbe
then
endeavoured
to
elicit
some
fresh
particulars
about
the
people
at
the
paradou
and
listened
intently
to
the
brother
s
monstrous
narrative
yes
that
little
came
and
sat
down
in
the
school
it
s
a
long
time
ago
now
she
might
then
have
been
about
ten
of
course
i
let
her
come
i
thought
her
uncle
was
sending
her
to
prepare
for
her
first
communion
but
for
two
months
she
utterly
revolutionised
the
whole
class
she
made
herself
worshipped
the
minx
she
knew
all
sorts
of
games
and
invented
all
sorts
of
finery
with
leaves
and
shreds
of
rags
and
how
quick
and
clever
she
was
too
like
all
those
children
of
hell
she
was
the
top
one
at
catechism
but
one
fine
morning
the
old
man
burst
in
just
in
the
middle
of
our
lessons
he
was
going
to
smash
everything
and
shouted
that
the
priests
had
taken
his
child
from
him
we
had
to
get
the
rural
policeman
to
turn
him
out
as
to
the
little
one
she
bolted
i
could
see
her
through
the
window
in
a
field
opposite
laughing
at
her
uncle
s
frenzy
she
had
been
coming
to
school
for
the
last
two
months
without
his
even
suspecting
it
he
had
regularly
scoured
the
country
after
she
s
never
taken
her
first
communion
exclaimed
la
teuse
below
her
breath
with
a
slight
shudder
no
never
rejoined
brother
archangias
she
must
be
sixteen
now
she
s
growing
up
like
a
brute
beast
i
have
seen
her
running
on
all
fours
in
a
thicket
near
la
on
all
fours
muttered
the
servant
turning
towards
the
window
with
superstitious
anxiety
abbe
mouret
attempted
to
express
some
doubt
but
the
brother
burst
out
yes
on
all
fours
and
she
jumped
like
a
wild
cat
if
i
had
only
had
a
gun
i
could
have
put
a
bullet
in
her
we
kill
creatures
that
are
far
more
pleasing
to
god
than
she
is
besides
every
one
knows
she
comes
caterwauling
every
night
round
les
artaud
she
howls
like
a
beast
if
ever
a
man
should
fall
into
her
clutches
she
wouldn
t
leave
him
a
scrap
of
skin
on
his
bones
i
the
brother
s
hatred
of
womankind
was
boiling
over
he
banged
the
table
with
his
fist
and
poured
forth
all
his
wonted
abuse
the
devil
s
in
them
they
reek
of
the
devil
and
that
s
what
bewitches
the
priest
nodded
approvingly
brother
archangias
s
outrageous
violence
and
la
teuse
s
loquacious
tyranny
were
like
castigation
with
thongs
which
it
often
rejoiced
him
to
find
lashing
his
shoulders
he
took
a
pious
delight
in
sinking
into
abasement
beneath
their
coarse
speech
he
seemed
to
see
the
peace
of
heaven
behind
contempt
of
the
world
and
degradation
of
his
whole
being
it
was
delicious
to
inflict
mortification
upon
his
body
to
drag
his
susceptible
nature
through
a
gutter
there
is
nought
but
filth
he
muttered
as
he
folded
up
his
napkin
la
teuse
began
to
clear
the
table
and
wished
to
remove
the
plate
on
which
desiree
had
laid
the
blackbird
s
nest
you
are
not
going
to
bed
here
i
suppose
mademoiselle
she
said
do
leave
those
nasty
desiree
however
defended
her
plate
she
covered
the
nest
with
her
bare
arms
no
longer
gay
but
cross
at
being
disturbed
i
hope
those
birds
are
not
going
to
be
kept
exclaimed
brother
archangias
it
would
bring
bad
luck
you
must
wring
their
and
he
already
stretched
out
his
big
hands
but
the
girl
rose
and
stepped
back
quivering
hugging
the
nest
to
her
bosom
she
stared
fixedly
at
the
brother
her
lips
curling
upwards
like
those
of
a
wolf
about
to
bite
don
t
touch
the
little
things
she
stammered
you
are
with
such
singular
contempt
did
she
emphasise
that
last
word
that
abbe
mouret
started
as
if
the
brother
s
ugliness
had
just
struck
him
for
the
first
time
the
latter
contented
himself
with
growling
he
had
always
felt
a
covert
hatred
for
desiree
whose
lusty
physical
development
offended
him
when
she
had
left
the
room
still
walking
backwards
and
never
taking
her
eyes
from
him
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
muttered
between
his
teeth
some
coarse
abuse
which
no
one
heard
she
had
better
go
to
bed
said
la
teuse
she
would
only
bore
us
in
has
any
one
come
yet
asked
abbe
mouret
oh
the
girls
have
been
outside
a
long
time
with
armfuls
of
boughs
i
am
just
going
to
light
the
lamps
we
can
begin
whenever
you
a
few
seconds
later
she
could
be
heard
swearing
in
the
sacristy
because
the
matches
were
damp
brother
archangias
who
remained
alone
with
the
priest
sourly
inquired
for
the
month
of
mary
eh
yes
replied
abbe
mouret
the
last
few
days
the
girls
about
here
were
hard
at
work
and
couldn
t
come
as
usual
to
decorate
the
lady
chapel
so
the
ceremony
was
postponed
till
a
nice
custom
muttered
the
brother
when
i
see
them
all
putting
up
their
boughs
i
feel
inclined
to
knock
them
down
and
make
them
confess
their
misdeeds
before
touching
the
altar
it
s
a
shame
to
allow
women
to
rustle
their
dresses
so
near
the
holy
the
abbe
made
an
apologetic
gesture
he
had
only
been
at
les
artaud
a
little
while
he
must
follow
the
customs
whenever
you
like
monsieur
le
cure
we
re
ready
now
called
out
la
teuse
but
brother
archangias
detained
him
a
minute
i
am
off
he
said
religion
isn
t
a
prostitute
that
it
should
be
decorated
with
flowers
and
he
walked
slowly
to
the
door
then
once
more
he
stopped
and
lifting
one
of
his
hairy
fingers
added
beware
of
your
devotion
to
the
xiii
on
entering
the
church
abbe
mouret
found
nine
or
ten
big
girls
awaiting
him
with
boughs
of
ivy
laurel
and
rosemary
few
garden
flowers
grew
on
the
rocks
of
les
artaud
so
the
custom
was
to
decorate
the
lady
altar
with
a
greenery
which
might
last
throughout
the
month
of
may
thereto
la
teuse
would
add
a
few
wallflowers
whose
stems
were
thrust
into
old
decanters
will
you
let
me
do
it
monsieur
le
cure
she
asked
you
are
not
used
to
it
come
stand
there
in
front
of
the
altar
you
can
tell
me
if
the
decorations
please
he
consented
and
it
was
she
who
really
directed
the
arrangements
having
climbed
upon
a
pair
of
steps
she
bullied
the
girls
as
they
came
up
to
her
in
turn
with
their
leafy
contributions
not
so
fast
now
you
must
give
me
time
to
fix
the
boughs
we
can
t
have
all
these
bundles
coming
down
on
his
reverence
s
head
come
on
babet
it
s
your
turn
what
s
the
good
of
staring
at
me
like
that
with
your
big
eyes
fine
rosemary
yours
is
my
word
as
yellow
as
a
thistle
you
next
la
rousse
ah
well
that
is
splendid
laurel
you
got
that
out
of
your
field
at
i
the
big
girls
laid
their
branches
on
the
altar
which
they
kissed
and
there
they
lingered
for
a
while
handing
up
the
greenery
to
la
teuse
the
sly
look
of
devotion
they
had
assumed
on
stepping
on
to
the
altar
steps
was
quickly
set
aside
and
soon
they
were
laughing
digging
each
other
with
their
knees
swaying
their
hips
against
the
altar
s
edge
and
thrusting
their
bosoms
against
the
tabernacle
itself
over
them
the
tall
virgin
in
gilded
plaster
bent
her
tinted
face
and
smiled
with
her
rosy
lips
upon
the
naked
jesus
she
bore
upon
her
left
arm
that
s
it
lisa
cried
la
teuse
why
don
t
you
sit
on
the
altar
while
you
re
about
it
just
pull
your
petticoats
straight
will
you
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
behaving
like
that
if
any
one
of
you
lolls
about
i
ll
lay
her
boughs
across
her
can
t
you
hand
me
the
things
quietly
then
turning
round
she
asked
do
you
like
it
sir
do
you
think
it
will
do
she
had
converted
the
space
behind
the
virgin
s
statue
into
a
verdant
niche
whence
leafy
sprays
projected
on
either
side
forming
a
bower
and
drooping
over
in
front
like
palm
leaves
the
priest
expressed
his
approval
but
ventured
to
remark
i
think
there
ought
to
be
a
cluster
of
more
delicate
foliage
up
no
doubt
grumbled
la
teuse
but
they
only
bring
me
laurel
and
rosemary
i
should
like
to
know
who
has
brought
an
olive
branch
not
one
you
bet
they
are
afraid
of
losing
a
single
olive
the
heathens
at
this
however
catherine
came
up
laden
with
an
enormous
olive
bough
which
completely
hid
her
oh
you
ve
got
some
you
minx
continued
the
old
servant
of
course
one
of
the
other
girls
exclaimed
she
stole
it
i
saw
vincent
breaking
it
off
while
she
kept
a
but
catherine
flew
into
a
rage
and
swore
it
was
not
true
she
turned
and
thrusting
her
auburn
head
through
the
greenery
which
she
still
tightly
held
she
started
lying
with
marvellous
assurance
inventing
quite
a
long
story
to
prove
that
the
olive
bough
was
really
hers
besides
she
added
all
the
trees
belong
to
the
blessed
abbe
mouret
was
about
to
intervene
but
la
teuse
sharply
inquired
if
they
wanted
to
make
game
of
her
and
keep
her
arms
up
there
all
night
at
last
she
proceeded
to
fasten
the
olive
bough
firmly
while
catherine
holding
on
to
the
steps
behind
her
mimicked
the
clumsy
manner
in
which
she
turned
her
huge
person
about
with
the
help
of
her
sound
leg
even
the
priest
could
not
forbear
to
smile
there
said
la
teuse
as
she
came
down
and
stood
beside
him
to
get
a
good
view
of
her
work
there
s
the
top
done
now
we
will
put
some
clumps
between
the
candlesticks
unless
you
would
prefer
a
garland
all
along
the
altar
the
priest
decided
in
favour
of
some
big
clumps
very
good
come
on
then
continued
the
old
servant
once
more
clambering
up
the
steps
we
can
t
go
to
bed
here
just
kiss
the
altar
will
you
miette
do
you
fancy
you
are
in
your
stable
monsieur
le
cure
do
just
see
what
they
are
up
to
over
there
i
can
hear
them
laughing
like
on
raising
one
of
the
two
lamps
the
dark
end
of
the
church
was
lit
up
and
three
of
the
girls
were
discovered
romping
about
under
the
gallery
one
of
them
had
stumbled
and
pitched
head
foremost
into
the
holy
water
stoup
which
mishap
had
so
tickled
the
others
that
they
were
rolling
on
the
ground
to
laugh
at
their
ease
they
all
came
back
however
looking
at
the
priest
sheepishly
with
lowered
eyelids
but
with
their
hands
swinging
against
their
hips
as
if
a
scolding
rather
pleased
them
than
otherwise
however
the
measure
of
la
teuse
s
wrath
was
filled
when
she
suddenly
perceived
rosalie
coming
up
to
the
altar
like
the
others
with
a
bundle
of
boughs
in
her
arms
get
down
will
you
she
cried
to
her
you
are
a
cool
one
and
no
mistake
my
lass
hurry
up
off
you
go
with
your
what
for
i
d
like
to
know
said
rosalie
boldly
you
can
t
say
i
have
stolen
the
other
girls
drew
closer
feigning
innocence
and
exchanging
sparkling
glances
clear
out
repeated
la
teuse
you
have
no
business
here
do
you
hear
then
quite
losing
her
scanty
patience
she
gave
vent
to
a
very
coarse
epithet
which
provoked
a
titter
of
delight
among
the
peasant
girls
well
what
next
said
rosalie
mind
your
own
business
is
it
any
concern
of
yours
then
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
sobbing
and
threw
down
her
boughs
but
let
the
abbe
lead
her
aside
and
give
her
a
severe
lecture
he
had
already
tried
to
silence
la
teuse
for
he
was
beginning
to
feel
uneasy
amidst
the
big
shameless
hussies
who
filled
the
church
with
their
armfuls
of
foliage
they
were
pushing
right
up
to
the
altar
step
enclosing
him
with
a
belt
of
woodland
wafting
in
his
face
a
rank
perfume
of
aromatic
shoots
let
us
make
haste
be
quick
he
exclaimed
clapping
his
hands
lightly
goodness
knows
i
would
rather
be
in
my
bed
grumbled
la
teuse
it
s
not
so
easy
as
you
think
to
fasten
all
these
bits
of
finally
however
she
succeeded
in
setting
some
lofty
plumes
of
foliage
between
the
candlesticks
next
she
folded
the
steps
which
were
laid
behind
the
high
altar
by
catherine
and
then
she
only
had
to
arrange
two
clumps
of
greenery
at
the
sides
of
the
altar
table
the
last
boughs
sufficed
for
this
and
indeed
there
were
some
left
which
the
girls
strewed
over
the
sanctuary
floor
up
to
the
wooden
rails
the
lady
altar
now
looked
like
a
grove
a
shrubbery
with
a
verdant
lawn
before
it
at
present
la
teuse
was
willing
to
make
way
for
abbe
mouret
who
ascended
the
altar
steps
and
again
lightly
clapping
his
hands
exclaimed
young
ladies
we
will
continue
the
devotions
of
the
month
of
mary
those
who
may
be
unable
to
come
ought
at
least
to
say
their
rosary
at
he
knelt
and
the
peasant
girls
with
a
mighty
rustle
of
skirts
sank
down
and
settled
themselves
on
their
heels
they
followed
his
prayer
with
a
confused
muttering
through
which
burst
here
and
there
a
giggle
one
of
them
on
being
pinched
from
behind
burst
into
a
scream
which
she
attempted
to
stifle
with
a
sudden
fit
of
coughing
and
this
so
diverted
the
others
that
for
a
moment
after
the
amen
they
remained
writhing
with
merriment
their
noses
close
to
the
stone
flags
la
teuse
dismissed
them
while
the
priest
after
crossing
himself
remained
absorbed
before
the
altar
no
longer
hearing
what
went
on
behind
him
come
now
clear
out
muttered
the
old
woman
you
re
a
pack
of
who
can
t
even
respect
god
it
s
shameful
it
s
unheard
of
for
girls
to
roll
about
on
the
floor
in
church
like
beasts
in
a
meadow
what
are
you
doing
there
la
rousse
if
i
see
you
pinching
any
one
you
ll
have
to
deal
with
me
oh
yes
you
may
put
out
your
tongue
at
me
i
ll
tell
his
reverence
about
it
out
you
get
out
you
get
you
minxes
she
drove
them
slowly
towards
the
door
while
running
and
bobbling
round
them
frantically
and
she
had
succeeded
as
she
thought
in
getting
every
one
of
them
outside
when
she
caught
sight
of
catherine
and
vincent
calmly
installed
in
the
confessional
where
they
were
eating
something
with
an
air
of
great
enjoyment
she
drove
them
away
and
as
she
popped
her
head
outside
the
church
before
closing
the
door
she
espied
rosalie
throwing
her
arm
over
the
shoulder
of
fortune
who
had
been
waiting
for
her
the
pair
of
them
vanished
in
the
darkness
amid
a
faint
sound
of
kisses
to
think
that
such
creatures
dare
to
come
to
our
lady
s
altar
la
teuse
stuttered
as
she
shot
the
bolts
the
others
are
no
better
i
am
sure
if
they
came
with
their
boughs
it
was
only
for
a
bit
of
fun
and
to
get
kissed
by
the
lads
on
going
off
not
one
of
them
will
put
herself
out
of
the
way
his
reverence
will
have
to
say
his
by
himself
we
shall
only
see
the
jades
who
have
got
thus
soliloquising
she
thrust
the
chairs
back
into
their
places
and
looked
round
to
see
if
anything
suspicious
was
lying
about
before
going
off
to
bed
in
the
confessional
she
picked
up
a
handful
of
which
she
threw
behind
the
high
altar
and
she
also
found
a
bit
of
ribbon
torn
from
some
cap
and
a
lock
of
black
hair
which
she
made
up
into
a
small
parcel
with
the
view
of
opening
an
inquiry
into
the
matter
with
these
exceptions
the
church
seemed
to
her
tidy
there
was
oil
enough
for
the
night
in
the
of
the
sanctuary
and
as
to
the
flags
of
the
choir
they
could
do
without
washing
till
saturday
it
s
nearly
ten
o
clock
monsieur
le
cure
she
said
drawing
near
the
priest
who
was
still
on
his
knees
you
might
as
well
come
up
he
made
no
answer
but
only
bowed
his
head
all
right
i
know
what
that
means
continued
la
teuse
in
another
hour
he
will
still
be
on
the
stones
there
giving
himself
a
i
m
off
as
i
shall
only
bore
him
all
the
same
i
can
t
see
much
sense
in
it
eating
one
s
lunch
when
others
are
at
dinner
and
going
to
bed
when
the
fowls
get
up
i
worry
you
don
t
i
your
reverence
you
re
not
at
all
reasonable
she
made
ready
to
go
but
suddenly
came
back
to
put
out
one
of
the
two
lamps
muttering
the
while
that
such
late
prayers
spelt
ruination
in
oil
then
at
last
she
did
go
off
after
passing
her
sleeve
brushwise
over
the
cloth
of
the
high
altar
which
seemed
to
her
grey
with
dust
abbe
mouret
his
eyes
uplifted
his
arms
tightly
clasped
against
his
breast
then
remained
alone
xiv
with
only
one
lamp
burning
amid
the
verdure
on
the
altar
of
the
virgin
huge
floating
shadows
filled
the
church
at
either
end
from
the
pulpit
a
sheet
of
gloom
projected
to
the
rafters
of
the
ceiling
the
confessional
looked
quite
black
under
the
gallery
showing
strange
outlines
suggestive
of
a
ruined
all
the
light
softened
and
tinted
as
it
were
by
the
green
foliage
rested
slumberingly
upon
the
tall
gilded
virgin
who
seemed
to
descend
with
queenly
mien
borne
upon
the
cloud
round
which
gambolled
the
winged
cherubim
at
sight
of
that
round
lamp
gleaming
amid
the
boughs
one
might
have
thought
the
pallid
moon
was
rising
on
the
verge
of
a
wood
casting
its
light
upon
a
regal
apparition
a
princess
of
heaven
crowned
and
clothed
with
gold
who
with
her
nude
and
divine
infant
had
come
to
stroll
in
the
mysterious
woodland
avenues
between
the
leaves
along
the
lofty
plumes
of
greenery
within
the
large
ogival
arbour
and
even
along
the
branches
strewing
the
flagstones
beams
glided
drowsily
like
the
milky
rain
of
light
that
filters
through
the
bushes
on
moonlit
nights
vague
sounds
and
creakings
came
from
the
dusky
ends
of
the
church
the
large
clock
on
the
left
of
the
chancel
throbbed
slowly
with
the
heavy
breathing
of
a
machine
asleep
and
the
radiant
vision
the
mother
with
slender
bands
of
chestnut
hair
as
if
reassured
by
the
nocturnal
quiet
of
the
nave
came
lower
and
lower
scarce
bending
the
blades
of
grass
in
the
clearings
beneath
the
gentle
flight
of
her
cloudy
chariot
abbe
mouret
gazed
at
her
this
was
the
hour
when
he
most
loved
the
church
he
forgot
the
woeful
figure
on
the
cross
the
victim
bedaubed
with
carmine
and
ochre
who
gasped
out
his
life
behind
him
in
the
chapel
of
the
dead
his
thoughts
were
no
longer
distracted
by
the
garish
light
from
the
windows
by
the
gayness
of
morning
coming
in
with
the
sun
by
the
irruption
of
outdoor
life
the
sparrows
and
the
boughs
invading
the
nave
through
the
shattered
panes
at
that
hour
of
night
nature
was
dead
shadows
hung
the
whitewashed
walls
with
crape
a
chill
fell
upon
his
shoulders
like
a
salutary
he
could
now
wholly
surrender
himself
to
the
supremest
love
without
fear
of
any
flickering
ray
of
light
any
caressing
breeze
or
scent
any
buzzing
of
an
insect
s
wing
disturbing
him
amidst
the
delight
of
loving
never
had
his
morning
mass
afforded
him
the
superhuman
joys
of
his
nightly
prayers
with
quivering
lips
abbe
mouret
now
gazed
at
the
tall
virgin
he
could
see
her
coming
towards
him
from
the
depths
of
her
green
bower
in
splendour
no
longer
did
a
flood
of
moonlight
seem
to
float
across
the
she
seemed
to
him
clothed
with
the
sun
she
advanced
majestically
glorious
colossal
and
so
that
he
was
tempted
at
times
to
cast
himself
face
downwards
to
shun
the
flaming
splendour
of
that
gate
opening
into
heaven
then
amidst
the
adoration
of
his
whole
being
which
stayed
his
words
upon
his
lips
he
remembered
brother
archangias
s
final
rebuke
as
he
might
have
remembered
words
of
blasphemy
the
brother
often
reproved
him
for
his
devotion
to
the
virgin
which
he
declared
was
veritable
robbery
of
devotion
due
to
god
in
the
brother
s
opinion
it
enervated
the
soul
put
religion
into
petticoats
created
and
fostered
a
state
of
sentimentalism
quite
unworthy
of
the
strong
he
bore
the
virgin
a
grudge
for
her
womanhood
her
beauty
her
maternity
he
was
ever
on
his
guard
against
her
possessed
by
a
covert
fear
of
feeling
tempted
by
her
gracious
mien
of
succumbing
to
her
seductive
sweetness
she
will
lead
you
far
he
had
cried
one
day
to
the
young
priest
for
in
her
he
saw
the
commencement
of
human
passion
from
contemplating
her
one
might
glide
to
delight
in
lovely
chestnut
hair
in
large
bright
eyes
and
the
mystery
of
garments
falling
from
neck
to
toes
his
was
the
blunt
rebellion
of
a
saint
who
roughly
parted
the
mother
from
the
son
asking
as
he
did
woman
what
have
we
in
common
thou
and
i
but
abbe
mouret
thrust
away
such
thoughts
prostrated
himself
endeavoured
to
forget
the
brother
s
harsh
attacks
his
rapture
in
the
immaculate
purity
of
mary
alone
raised
him
from
the
depths
of
lowliness
in
which
he
sought
to
bury
himself
whenever
alone
before
the
tall
golden
virgin
he
so
deceived
himself
as
to
imagine
that
he
could
see
her
bending
down
for
him
to
kiss
her
braided
locks
he
once
more
became
very
young
very
good
very
strong
very
just
full
of
tenderness
abbe
mouret
s
devotion
to
the
virgin
dated
from
his
early
youth
already
when
he
was
quite
a
child
somewhat
shy
and
fond
of
shrinking
into
corners
he
took
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
a
lovely
lady
was
watching
over
him
that
two
blue
eyes
so
sweet
ever
followed
him
with
their
smile
when
he
felt
at
night
a
breath
of
air
glide
across
his
hair
he
would
often
say
that
the
virgin
had
come
to
kiss
him
he
had
grown
up
beneath
this
womanly
caress
in
an
atmosphere
full
of
the
rustle
of
divine
robes
from
the
age
of
seven
he
had
satisfied
the
cravings
of
his
affection
by
expending
all
the
pence
he
received
as
pocket
money
in
the
purchase
of
pious
which
he
jealously
concealed
that
he
alone
might
feast
on
them
but
never
was
he
tempted
by
the
pictures
of
jesus
and
the
lamb
of
christ
on
the
cross
of
god
the
father
with
a
mighty
beard
stooping
over
a
bank
of
clouds
his
preference
was
always
for
the
winning
portraits
of
mary
with
her
tiny
smiling
mouth
and
delicate
outstretched
hands
by
degrees
he
had
made
quite
a
collection
of
them
all
of
mary
between
a
lily
and
a
distaff
mary
carrying
her
child
as
if
she
were
his
elder
sister
mary
crowned
with
roses
and
mary
crowned
with
stars
for
him
they
formed
a
family
of
lovely
young
maidens
alike
in
their
attractiveness
in
the
grace
kindliness
and
sweetness
of
their
countenances
so
youthful
beneath
their
veils
that
although
they
bore
the
name
of
mother
of
god
he
had
felt
no
awe
of
them
as
he
had
often
felt
for
persons
they
seemed
to
him
of
his
own
age
little
girls
such
as
he
wished
to
meet
with
little
girls
of
heaven
such
as
the
little
boys
who
die
when
seven
years
old
have
for
eternal
playmates
in
some
nook
of
paradise
but
even
at
this
early
age
he
was
and
full
of
the
exquisite
bashfulness
of
adolescence
he
grew
up
without
betraying
the
secret
of
his
religious
love
mary
grew
up
with
him
being
invariably
a
year
or
two
older
than
himself
as
should
always
be
the
case
with
one
s
chiefest
friend
when
he
was
eighteen
she
was
twenty
she
no
longer
kissed
his
forehead
at
night
time
but
stood
a
little
further
from
him
with
folded
arms
chastely
smiling
ravishingly
sweet
and
he
he
only
named
her
now
in
a
whisper
feeling
as
if
he
would
faint
each
time
the
name
passed
his
lips
in
prayer
no
more
did
he
dream
of
childish
games
within
the
garden
of
heaven
but
of
continual
contemplation
before
that
white
figure
whose
perfect
purity
he
feared
to
sully
with
his
breath
even
from
his
own
mother
did
he
conceal
the
fervour
of
his
love
for
mary
then
a
few
years
later
at
the
seminary
his
beautiful
affection
for
her
seemingly
so
just
so
natural
was
disturbed
by
inward
qualms
was
the
cult
of
mary
necessary
for
salvation
was
he
not
robbing
god
by
giving
mary
a
part
the
greater
part
of
his
love
his
thoughts
his
heart
his
entire
being
perplexing
questions
were
these
provoking
an
inward
struggle
which
increased
his
passion
riveted
his
bonds
for
he
dived
into
all
the
subtleties
of
his
affection
found
unknown
joys
in
discussing
the
lawfulness
of
his
feelings
the
books
treating
of
devotion
to
the
virgin
brought
him
excuses
joyful
raptures
a
wealth
of
arguments
which
he
repeated
with
prayerful
fervour
from
them
he
learned
how
in
mary
to
be
the
slave
of
jesus
he
went
to
jesus
through
mary
he
cited
all
kinds
of
proofs
he
discriminated
he
drew
inferences
mary
whom
jesus
had
obeyed
on
earth
should
be
obeyed
by
all
mankind
mary
still
retained
her
maternal
power
in
heaven
where
she
was
the
great
dispenser
of
god
s
treasures
the
only
one
who
could
beseech
him
the
only
one
who
allotted
the
heavenly
thrones
and
thus
mary
a
mere
creature
before
god
but
raised
up
to
him
became
the
human
link
between
heaven
and
earth
the
intermediary
of
every
grace
of
every
mercy
and
his
conclusion
always
was
that
she
should
be
loved
above
all
else
in
god
himself
another
time
he
was
attracted
by
more
complicated
theological
curiosities
the
marriage
of
the
celestial
spouse
the
holy
ghost
sealing
the
vase
of
election
making
of
the
virgin
mary
an
everlasting
miracle
offering
her
inviolable
purity
to
the
devotion
of
mankind
she
was
the
virgin
overcoming
all
heresies
the
irreconcilable
foe
of
satan
the
new
eve
of
whom
it
had
been
foretold
that
she
should
crush
the
serpent
s
head
the
august
gate
of
grace
by
which
the
saviour
had
already
entered
once
and
through
which
he
would
come
again
at
the
last
day
a
vague
prophecy
allotting
a
yet
larger
future
role
to
mary
which
threw
serge
into
a
dreamy
imagining
of
some
immense
expansion
of
divine
love
this
entry
of
woman
into
the
jealous
cruel
heaven
depicted
by
the
old
testament
this
figure
of
whiteness
set
at
the
feet
of
the
awesome
trinity
appeared
to
him
the
very
grace
itself
of
religion
the
one
consolation
for
all
the
dread
inspired
by
things
of
faith
the
one
refuge
when
he
found
himself
lost
amidst
the
mysteries
of
dogma
and
when
he
had
thus
proved
to
himself
point
by
point
that
she
was
the
way
to
jesus
easy
short
perfect
and
certain
he
surrendered
himself
anew
to
her
wholly
and
without
remorse
he
strove
to
be
her
true
devotee
dead
to
self
and
steeped
in
submission
it
was
an
hour
of
divine
voluptuousness
the
books
treating
of
devotion
to
the
virgin
burned
his
hands
they
spoke
to
him
in
a
language
of
love
warm
fragrant
as
incense
mary
no
longer
seemed
a
young
maiden
veiled
in
white
standing
with
crossed
arms
a
foot
or
two
away
from
his
pillow
she
came
surrounded
by
splendour
even
as
john
saw
her
clothed
with
the
sun
crowned
with
twelve
stars
and
having
the
moon
beneath
her
feet
she
perfumed
him
with
her
fragrance
inflamed
him
with
longing
for
heaven
ravished
him
even
with
the
ardent
glow
of
the
planets
flaming
on
her
brow
he
threw
himself
before
her
and
called
himself
her
slave
no
word
could
have
been
sweeter
than
that
word
of
slave
which
he
repeated
which
he
relished
yet
more
and
more
as
it
trembled
on
his
stammering
tongue
whilst
casting
himself
at
her
feet
to
become
her
thing
her
mite
the
dust
lightly
scattered
by
the
waving
of
her
azure
robe
with
david
he
exclaimed
mary
is
made
for
me
and
with
the
evangelist
he
added
i
have
taken
her
for
my
he
called
her
his
beloved
mistress
for
words
failed
him
and
he
fell
into
the
prattle
of
child
or
lover
his
breath
breaking
with
intensity
of
passion
she
was
the
blessed
among
women
the
queen
of
heaven
glorified
by
the
nine
choirs
of
angels
the
mother
of
predilection
the
treasure
of
the
lord
all
the
vivid
imagery
of
her
cult
unrolled
itself
before
him
comparing
to
her
an
earthly
paradise
of
virgin
soil
with
beds
of
flowering
virtues
green
meadows
of
hope
impregnable
towers
of
strength
and
smiling
dwellings
of
confidence
again
she
was
a
fountain
sealed
by
the
holy
ghost
a
shrine
and
of
the
holy
trinity
the
throne
of
god
the
city
of
god
the
altar
of
god
the
temple
of
god
and
the
world
of
god
and
he
walked
in
that
garden
in
its
shade
its
sunlight
beneath
its
enchanting
greenery
he
sighed
after
the
water
of
that
fountain
he
dwelt
within
mary
s
beauteous
precincts
resting
hiding
heedlessly
straying
there
drinking
in
the
milk
of
infinite
love
that
fell
drop
by
drop
from
her
virginal
bosom
every
morning
on
rising
at
the
seminary
he
greeted
mary
with
a
hundred
bows
his
face
turned
towards
the
strip
of
sky
visible
from
his
window
and
at
night
in
like
fashion
he
bade
her
farewell
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stars
often
when
he
thus
gazed
out
on
fine
bright
nights
when
venus
gleamed
golden
and
dreamy
through
the
warm
atmosphere
he
forgot
himself
and
then
like
a
soft
song
would
fall
from
his
lips
the
maris
that
tender
hymn
which
set
before
his
eyes
a
distant
azure
land
and
a
tranquil
sea
scarce
wrinkled
by
a
caressing
quiver
and
illuminated
by
a
smiling
star
a
very
sun
in
size
he
recited
too
the
the
the
gloriosa
all
the
prayers
and
all
the
canticles
he
would
read
the
office
of
the
virgin
the
holy
books
written
in
her
honour
the
little
psalter
of
bonaventura
with
such
devout
tenderness
that
he
could
not
turn
the
leaves
for
tears
he
fasted
and
mortified
himself
that
he
might
offer
up
to
her
his
bruised
and
wounded
flesh
ever
since
the
age
of
ten
he
had
worn
her
livery
the
holy
scapular
the
twofold
image
of
mary
sewn
on
squares
of
cloth
whose
warmth
upon
his
chest
and
back
thrilled
him
with
delight
later
on
he
also
took
to
wearing
the
little
chain
in
token
of
his
loving
slavery
but
his
greatest
act
of
love
was
ever
the
angelic
salutation
the
his
heart
s
perfect
prayer
hail
mary
and
he
saw
her
advancing
towards
him
full
of
grace
blessed
amongst
women
and
he
cast
his
heart
at
her
feet
for
her
to
tread
on
it
in
sweetness
he
multiplied
and
repeated
that
salutation
in
a
hundred
different
ways
ever
seeking
some
more
efficacious
one
he
would
say
twelve
to
commemorate
the
crown
of
twelve
stars
that
encircled
mary
s
brow
he
would
say
fourteen
in
remembrance
of
her
fourteen
joys
at
another
time
he
would
recite
seven
decades
of
them
in
honour
of
the
years
she
lived
on
earth
for
hours
the
beads
of
his
rosary
would
glide
between
his
fingers
then
again
on
certain
days
of
mystical
assignation
he
would
launch
into
the
endless
muttering
of
the
rosary
when
alone
in
his
cell
with
time
to
give
to
his
love
he
knelt
upon
the
floor
the
whole
of
mary
s
garden
with
its
lofty
flowers
of
chastity
blossomed
around
him
between
his
fingers
glided
the
rosary
s
wreath
of
intersected
by
like
a
garland
of
white
roses
mingled
with
the
lilies
of
the
annunciation
the
flowers
of
calvary
and
the
stars
of
the
coronation
he
would
slowly
tread
those
fragrant
paths
pausing
at
each
of
the
fifteen
dizains
of
and
dwelling
on
its
corresponding
mystery
he
was
beside
himself
with
joy
or
grief
or
triumph
according
as
the
mystery
belonged
to
one
or
other
of
the
three
series
the
joyful
the
sorrowful
or
the
glorious
what
an
incomparable
legend
it
was
the
history
of
mary
a
complete
human
life
with
all
its
smiles
and
tears
and
triumph
which
he
lived
over
again
from
end
to
end
in
a
single
moment
and
first
he
entered
into
joy
with
the
five
glad
mysteries
steeped
in
the
serene
calm
of
dawn
first
the
archangel
s
salutation
the
fertilising
ray
gliding
down
from
heaven
fraught
with
the
spotless
union
s
adorable
ecstasy
then
the
visit
to
elizabeth
on
a
bright
morn
when
the
fruit
of
mary
s
womb
for
the
first
time
stirred
and
thrilled
her
with
the
shock
at
which
mothers
blench
then
the
birth
in
a
stable
at
bethlehem
and
the
long
string
of
shepherds
coming
to
pay
homage
to
her
divine
maternity
then
the
babe
carried
into
the
temple
on
the
arms
of
his
mother
who
smiled
still
weary
but
already
happy
at
offering
her
child
to
god
s
justice
to
simeon
s
embrace
to
the
desires
of
the
world
and
lastly
jesus
at
a
later
age
revealing
himself
before
the
doctors
in
whose
midst
he
is
found
by
his
anxious
mother
now
proud
and
comforted
but
after
that
tender
radiant
dawn
it
seemed
to
serge
as
if
the
sky
were
suddenly
overcast
his
feet
now
trod
on
brambles
the
beads
of
the
rosary
pricked
his
fingers
he
cowered
beneath
the
horror
of
the
five
sorrowful
mysteries
mary
agonising
in
her
son
in
the
garden
of
olives
suffering
with
him
from
the
scourging
feeling
on
her
own
brow
the
wounds
made
by
the
crown
of
thorns
bearing
the
fearful
weight
of
his
cross
and
dying
at
his
feet
on
calvary
those
inevitable
sufferings
that
harrowing
martyrdom
of
the
queen
he
worshipped
and
for
whom
he
would
have
shed
his
blood
like
jesus
roused
in
him
a
feeling
of
shuddering
repulsion
which
ten
years
practice
of
the
same
prayers
and
the
same
devotions
had
failed
to
weaken
but
as
the
beads
flowed
on
light
suddenly
burst
upon
the
darkness
of
the
crucifixion
and
the
resplendent
glory
of
the
five
last
mysteries
shone
forth
in
all
the
brightness
of
a
cloudless
sun
mary
was
transfigured
and
sang
the
hallelujah
of
the
resurrection
the
victory
over
death
and
the
eternity
of
life
with
outstretched
hands
and
dazed
with
admiration
she
beheld
the
triumph
of
her
son
ascending
into
heaven
on
golden
clouds
fringed
with
purple
she
gathered
the
apostles
round
her
and
as
on
the
day
of
her
conception
participated
in
the
glow
of
the
spirit
of
love
descending
now
in
tongues
of
fire
she
too
was
carried
up
to
heaven
by
a
flight
of
angels
borne
aloft
on
their
white
wings
like
a
spotless
ark
and
tenderly
set
down
amid
the
splendour
of
the
heavenly
thrones
and
there
in
her
supreme
glory
amidst
a
splendour
so
dazzling
that
the
light
of
the
sun
was
quenched
god
crowned
her
with
the
stars
of
the
firmament
impassioned
love
has
but
one
word
in
reciting
a
hundred
and
fifty
serge
had
not
once
repeated
himself
the
monotonous
murmur
the
ever
recurring
words
akin
to
the
i
love
you
of
lovers
assumed
each
time
a
deeper
and
deeper
meaning
and
he
lingered
over
it
all
expressed
everything
with
the
aid
of
the
one
solitary
latin
sentence
and
learned
to
know
mary
through
and
through
until
as
the
last
bead
of
his
rosary
slipped
from
his
hand
his
heart
grew
faint
with
the
thought
of
parting
from
her
many
a
night
had
the
young
man
spent
in
this
way
daybreak
had
found
him
still
murmuring
his
prayers
it
was
the
moon
he
would
say
to
cheat
himself
that
was
making
the
stars
wane
his
superiors
had
to
reprove
him
for
those
vigils
which
left
him
languid
and
pale
as
if
he
had
been
losing
blood
on
the
wall
of
his
cell
had
long
hung
a
coloured
engraving
of
the
sacred
heart
of
mary
an
engraving
which
showed
the
virgin
smiling
placidly
throwing
open
her
bodice
and
revealing
a
crimson
fissure
wherein
glowed
her
heart
pierced
with
a
sword
and
crowned
with
white
roses
that
sword
tormented
him
beyond
measure
brought
him
an
intolerable
horror
of
suffering
in
woman
the
very
thought
of
which
scattered
his
pious
submissiveness
to
the
winds
he
erased
the
weapon
and
left
only
the
crowned
and
flaming
heart
which
seemed
to
be
half
torn
from
that
exquisite
flesh
as
if
tendered
as
an
offering
to
himself
and
it
was
then
he
felt
beloved
mary
was
giving
him
her
heart
her
living
heart
even
as
it
throbbed
in
her
bosom
dripping
with
her
rosy
blood
in
all
this
there
was
no
longer
the
imagery
of
devout
passion
but
a
material
entity
a
prodigy
of
affection
which
impelled
him
when
he
was
praying
before
the
engraving
to
open
out
his
hands
in
order
that
he
might
reverently
receive
the
heart
that
leaped
from
that
immaculate
bosom
he
could
see
it
hear
it
beat
he
was
loved
that
heart
was
beating
for
himself
his
whole
being
quickened
with
rapture
he
would
fain
have
kissed
that
heart
have
melted
in
it
have
lain
beside
it
within
the
depths
of
that
open
breast
mary
s
love
for
him
was
an
active
one
she
desired
him
to
be
near
her
to
be
wholly
hers
in
the
eternity
to
come
her
love
was
efficacious
too
she
was
ever
solicitous
for
him
watching
over
him
everywhere
guarding
him
from
the
slightest
breach
of
his
fidelity
she
loved
him
tenderly
more
than
the
whole
of
womankind
together
with
a
love
as
azure
as
deep
as
boundless
as
the
sky
itself
where
could
he
ever
find
so
delightful
a
mistress
what
earthly
caress
could
be
compared
to
the
air
in
which
he
moved
the
breath
of
mary
what
mundane
union
or
enjoyment
could
be
weighed
against
that
everlasting
flower
of
desire
which
grew
unceasingly
and
yet
was
never
at
this
thought
the
would
exhale
from
his
mouth
like
a
cloud
of
incense
he
sang
the
joyful
song
of
mary
her
thrill
of
joy
at
the
approach
of
her
divine
spouse
he
glorified
the
lord
who
overthrew
the
mighty
from
their
thrones
and
who
sent
mary
to
him
poor
destitute
child
that
he
was
dying
of
love
on
the
cold
tiled
floor
of
his
cell
and
when
he
had
given
all
up
to
mary
his
body
his
soul
his
earthly
goods
and
spiritual
chattels
when
he
stood
before
her
stripped
bare
with
all
his
prayers
exhausted
there
welled
from
his
burning
lips
the
virgin
s
litanies
with
their
reiterated
persistent
impassioned
appeals
for
heavenly
succour
he
fancied
himself
climbing
a
flight
of
pious
yearnings
which
he
ascended
step
by
step
at
each
bound
of
his
heart
first
he
called
her
next
he
called
her
mother
most
pure
most
chaste
amiable
and
admirable
and
with
fresh
ardour
he
six
times
proclaimed
her
maidenhood
his
lips
cooled
and
freshened
each
time
that
he
pronounced
that
name
of
virgin
which
he
coupled
with
power
goodness
and
fidelity
and
as
his
heart
drew
him
higher
up
the
ladder
of
light
a
strange
voice
from
his
veins
spoke
within
him
bursting
into
dazzling
flowers
of
speech
he
yearned
to
melt
away
in
fragrance
to
be
spread
around
in
light
to
expire
in
a
sigh
of
music
as
he
named
her
mirror
of
justice
seat
of
wisdom
and
source
of
joy
he
could
behold
himself
pale
with
ecstasy
in
that
mirror
kneeling
on
the
warmth
of
the
divine
seat
quaffing
intoxication
in
mighty
draughts
from
the
holy
source
again
he
would
transform
her
throwing
off
all
restraint
in
his
frantic
love
so
as
to
attain
to
a
yet
closer
union
with
her
she
became
a
vessel
of
honour
chosen
of
god
a
bosom
of
election
wherein
he
desired
to
pour
his
being
and
slumber
for
ever
she
was
the
mystical
rose
a
great
flower
which
bloomed
in
paradise
with
petals
formed
of
the
angels
clustering
round
their
queen
a
flower
so
fresh
so
fragrant
that
he
could
inhale
its
perfume
from
the
depths
of
his
unworthiness
with
a
joyful
dilation
of
his
sides
which
stretched
them
to
bursting
she
became
changed
into
a
house
of
gold
a
tower
of
david
and
a
tower
of
ivory
of
inestimable
richness
of
a
whiteness
that
swans
might
envy
and
of
lofty
massive
rounded
form
which
he
would
fain
have
encircled
with
his
outstretched
arms
as
with
a
girdle
of
submissiveness
she
stood
on
the
distant
skyline
as
the
gate
of
heaven
a
glimpse
of
which
he
caught
behind
her
shoulders
when
a
puff
of
wind
threw
back
the
folds
of
her
veil
she
rose
in
splendour
from
behind
the
mountain
in
the
waning
hour
of
night
like
the
morning
star
to
help
all
travellers
astray
like
the
very
dawn
of
love
and
when
he
had
ascended
to
this
height
scant
of
breath
yet
still
unsatiated
he
could
only
further
glorify
her
with
the
title
of
queen
with
which
he
nine
times
hailed
her
as
with
nine
parting
salutations
from
the
censer
of
his
soul
his
canticle
died
joyfully
away
in
those
last
ejaculations
of
triumph
queen
of
virgins
queen
of
all
saints
queen
conceived
without
sin
she
ever
before
him
shone
in
splendour
and
he
on
the
topmost
step
only
reached
by
mary
s
intimates
remained
there
yet
another
moment
swooning
amidst
the
subtle
atmosphere
around
him
still
too
far
away
to
kiss
the
edge
of
her
azure
robe
already
feeling
that
he
was
about
to
fall
but
ever
possessed
by
a
desire
to
ascend
again
and
again
and
seek
that
superhuman
felicity
curiously
enough
i
find
no
trace
of
bosom
of
election
in
the
litany
of
the
blessed
virgin
as
printed
in
english
catholic
ed
how
many
times
had
not
the
litany
of
the
virgin
recited
in
common
in
the
seminary
chapel
left
the
young
man
with
broken
limbs
and
void
head
as
if
from
some
great
fall
and
since
his
departure
from
the
seminary
abbe
mouret
had
grown
to
love
the
virgin
still
more
he
gave
to
her
that
impassioned
cult
which
to
brother
archangias
savoured
of
heresy
in
his
opinion
it
was
she
who
would
save
the
church
by
some
matchless
prodigy
whose
near
appearance
would
entrance
the
world
she
was
the
only
miracle
of
our
impious
age
the
lady
that
showed
herself
to
little
shepherdesses
the
whiteness
that
gleamed
at
night
between
two
clouds
her
veil
trailing
over
the
low
thatched
roofs
of
peasant
homes
when
brother
archangias
coarsely
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
espied
her
he
simply
smiled
and
tightened
his
lips
as
if
to
keep
his
secret
truth
to
say
he
saw
her
every
night
she
no
longer
seemed
a
playful
sister
or
a
lovely
pious
maiden
she
wore
a
bridal
robe
with
white
flowers
in
her
hair
and
from
beneath
her
drooping
eyelids
fell
moist
glances
of
hopeful
promise
that
set
his
cheeks
aglow
he
could
feel
that
she
was
coming
that
she
was
promising
to
delay
no
longer
that
she
said
to
him
here
i
am
receive
me
thrice
a
day
when
the
rang
out
at
break
of
dawn
in
the
fulness
of
midday
and
at
the
gentle
fall
of
twilight
he
bared
his
head
and
said
an
with
a
glance
around
him
as
if
to
ascertain
whether
the
bell
were
not
at
last
announcing
mary
s
coming
he
was
he
awaited
her
during
the
month
of
may
the
young
priest
s
expectation
was
fraught
with
joyful
hope
to
la
teuse
s
grumblings
he
no
longer
paid
the
slightest
attention
if
he
remained
so
late
praying
in
the
church
it
was
because
he
entertained
the
mad
idea
that
the
great
golden
virgin
would
at
last
come
down
from
her
pedestal
and
yet
he
stood
in
awe
of
that
virgin
so
like
a
princess
in
her
mien
he
did
not
love
all
the
virgins
alike
and
this
one
inspired
him
with
supreme
respect
she
was
indeed
the
mother
of
god
she
showed
the
fertile
development
of
form
the
majestic
countenance
the
strong
arms
of
the
divine
spouse
bearing
jesus
he
pictured
her
thus
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
heavenly
court
the
train
of
her
royal
mantle
trailing
among
the
stars
so
far
above
him
and
of
such
exceeding
might
that
he
would
be
shattered
into
dust
should
she
deign
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
him
she
was
the
virgin
of
his
days
of
weakness
the
austere
virgin
who
restored
his
inward
peace
by
an
awesome
glimpse
of
paradise
that
night
abbe
mouret
remained
for
over
an
hour
on
his
knees
in
the
empty
church
with
folded
hands
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
golden
virgin
rising
amid
the
verdure
he
sought
the
drowsiness
of
ecstasy
the
appeasement
of
the
strange
discomfort
he
had
felt
that
day
but
he
failed
to
find
the
of
prayer
with
the
delightful
ease
he
knew
so
well
however
glorious
and
pure
mary
might
reveal
herself
her
motherhood
the
maturity
of
her
charms
and
the
bare
infant
she
bore
upon
her
arm
disquieted
him
it
seemed
as
if
in
heaven
itself
there
were
a
repetition
of
the
exuberant
life
through
which
he
had
been
moving
since
the
morning
like
the
vines
of
the
stony
slopes
like
the
trees
of
the
paradou
like
the
human
troop
of
artauds
mary
suggested
the
blossoming
the
begetting
of
life
prayer
came
but
slowly
to
his
lips
fancies
made
his
mind
wander
he
perceived
things
he
had
never
seen
before
the
gentle
wave
of
her
chestnut
hair
the
rounded
swell
of
her
rosy
throat
she
had
to
assume
a
sterner
air
and
overwhelm
him
with
the
splendour
of
her
sovereign
power
to
bring
him
back
to
the
unfinished
sentences
of
his
broken
prayer
at
last
the
sight
of
her
golden
crown
her
golden
mantle
all
the
golden
sheen
which
made
of
her
a
mighty
princess
reduced
him
once
more
to
slavish
submission
and
his
prayer
again
flowed
evenly
and
his
mind
became
wrapped
in
worship
in
this
ecstatic
trance
half
asleep
half
awake
he
remained
till
eleven
o
clock
heedless
of
his
aching
knees
fancying
himself
suspended
in
mid
air
rocked
to
and
fro
like
a
child
and
yielding
to
restful
slumber
though
conscious
of
some
unknown
weight
that
oppressed
his
heart
meanwhile
the
church
around
him
filled
with
shadows
the
lamp
grew
dim
and
the
lofty
sprays
of
leafage
darkened
the
tall
virgin
s
varnished
face
when
the
clock
about
to
strike
gave
out
a
rending
whine
a
shudder
passed
through
abbe
mouret
he
had
not
hitherto
felt
the
chill
of
the
church
upon
his
shoulders
but
now
he
was
shivering
from
head
to
foot
as
he
crossed
himself
a
memory
swiftly
flashed
through
the
stupor
of
his
wakening
the
chattering
of
his
teeth
recalled
to
him
the
nights
he
had
spent
on
the
floor
of
his
cell
before
the
sacred
heart
of
mary
when
his
whole
frame
would
quiver
with
fever
he
rose
up
painfully
displeased
with
himself
as
a
rule
he
would
leave
the
altar
untroubled
in
his
flesh
and
with
mary
s
sweet
breath
still
fresh
upon
his
brow
that
night
however
as
he
took
the
lamp
to
go
up
to
his
room
he
felt
as
if
his
throbbing
temples
were
bursting
his
prayer
had
not
profited
him
after
a
transient
alleviation
he
still
experienced
the
burning
glow
which
had
been
rising
in
his
heart
and
brain
since
morning
when
he
reached
the
sacristy
door
he
turned
and
mechanically
raised
the
lamp
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
tall
virgin
but
she
was
now
shrouded
in
the
deep
shadows
falling
from
the
rafters
buried
in
the
foliage
around
her
whence
only
the
golden
cross
upon
her
crown
emerged
xv
abbe
mouret
s
bedroom
which
occupied
a
corner
of
the
vicarage
was
a
spacious
one
having
two
large
square
windows
one
of
which
opened
above
desiree
s
farmyard
whilst
the
other
overlooked
the
village
the
valley
beyond
the
belt
of
hills
the
whole
landscape
the
bed
the
walnut
chest
of
drawers
and
the
three
chairs
seemed
lost
below
that
lofty
ceiling
with
whitewashed
joists
a
faint
tartness
the
somewhat
musty
odour
of
old
country
houses
ascended
from
the
tiled
and
ruddled
floor
that
glistened
like
a
mirror
on
the
chest
of
drawers
a
tall
statuette
of
the
immaculate
conception
rose
greyly
between
some
porcelain
vases
which
la
teuse
had
filled
with
white
lilac
abbe
mouret
set
his
lamp
on
the
edge
of
the
chest
of
drawers
before
the
virgin
he
felt
so
unwell
that
he
determined
to
light
the
fire
which
was
laid
in
readiness
he
stood
there
tongs
in
hand
watching
the
kindling
wood
his
face
illuminated
by
the
flame
the
house
beneath
slumbered
in
unbroken
stillness
the
silence
filled
his
ears
with
a
hum
which
grew
into
a
sound
of
whispering
voices
slowly
and
irresistibly
these
voices
mastered
him
and
increased
the
feeling
of
anxiety
which
had
almost
choked
him
several
times
that
day
what
could
be
the
cause
of
such
mental
anguish
what
could
be
the
strange
trouble
which
had
slowly
grown
within
him
and
had
now
become
so
unbearable
he
had
not
fallen
into
sin
it
seemed
as
if
but
yesterday
he
had
left
the
seminary
with
all
his
ardent
faith
and
so
fortified
against
the
world
that
he
moved
among
men
beholding
god
alone
and
suddenly
he
fancied
himself
in
his
cell
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
hour
for
rising
the
deacon
on
duty
passed
his
door
striking
it
with
his
stick
and
repeating
the
regulation
summons
he
answered
half
asleep
with
his
eyes
still
swollen
with
slumber
and
he
jumped
out
upon
his
strip
of
carpet
washed
himself
made
his
bed
swept
his
room
and
refilled
his
little
pitcher
he
enjoyed
this
petty
domestic
work
while
the
morning
air
sent
a
thrilling
shiver
throughout
his
frame
he
could
hear
the
sparrows
in
the
of
the
rising
at
the
same
time
as
himself
with
a
deafening
noise
of
wings
and
notes
their
way
of
saying
their
prayers
thought
he
then
he
went
down
to
the
meditation
room
and
stayed
there
on
his
knees
for
half
an
hour
after
prayers
to
con
that
reflection
of
ignatius
what
profit
be
it
to
a
man
to
gain
the
whole
world
if
he
lose
his
soul
a
subject
this
fertile
in
good
resolutions
which
impelled
him
to
renounce
all
earthly
goods
and
dwell
on
that
fond
dream
of
a
desert
life
beneath
the
solitary
wealth
and
luxury
of
a
vast
blue
sky
when
ten
minutes
had
passed
his
bruised
knees
became
so
painful
that
his
whole
being
slowly
swooned
into
ecstasy
in
which
he
pictured
himself
as
a
mighty
conqueror
the
master
of
an
immense
empire
flinging
down
his
crown
breaking
his
sceptre
trampling
under
foot
wealth
chests
of
gold
floods
of
jewels
and
rich
stuffs
embroidered
with
precious
stones
before
going
to
bury
himself
in
some
thebais
clothed
in
rough
drugget
that
rasped
his
back
mass
however
snatched
him
from
these
heated
fancies
upon
which
he
looked
back
as
upon
some
beautiful
reality
which
might
have
been
his
lot
in
ancient
times
and
then
his
communion
made
he
chanted
the
psalm
for
the
day
unconscious
of
any
other
voice
than
his
own
which
rang
out
with
crystal
purity
flying
upward
till
it
reached
the
very
ear
of
the
lord
when
he
returned
to
his
room
he
ascended
the
stairs
step
by
step
as
advised
by
bonaventura
and
thomas
aquinas
his
gait
was
slow
his
mien
grave
he
kept
his
head
bowed
as
he
walked
along
finding
ineffable
delight
in
complying
with
the
most
trifling
regulations
next
came
breakfast
it
was
pleasant
in
the
refectory
to
see
the
hunks
of
bread
and
the
glasses
of
white
wine
set
out
in
rows
he
had
a
good
appetite
and
was
of
a
joyous
mood
he
would
say
for
instance
that
the
wine
was
truly
christian
a
daring
allusion
to
the
water
which
the
bursar
was
taxed
with
putting
in
the
bottles
still
his
gravity
at
once
returned
to
him
on
going
in
to
lectures
he
took
notes
on
his
knees
while
the
professor
resting
his
hands
on
the
edge
of
his
desk
talked
away
in
familiar
latin
interspersed
with
an
occasional
word
in
french
when
he
was
at
fault
for
a
better
a
discussion
would
then
follow
in
which
the
students
argued
in
a
strange
jargon
with
never
a
smile
upon
their
faces
then
at
ten
o
clock
there
came
twenty
minutes
reading
of
holy
writ
he
fetched
the
sacred
book
a
volume
richly
bound
and
having
kissed
it
with
especial
reverence
he
read
it
out
bowing
every
time
he
came
upon
the
name
of
jesus
mary
or
joseph
and
with
the
arrival
of
the
second
meditation
he
was
ready
to
endure
for
love
of
god
another
and
even
longer
spell
of
kneeling
than
the
first
he
avoided
resting
on
his
heels
for
a
second
even
he
delighted
in
that
examination
of
conscience
which
lasted
for
of
an
hour
he
racked
his
memory
for
sins
and
at
times
even
fancied
himself
damned
for
forgetting
to
kiss
the
pictures
on
his
scapular
the
night
before
or
for
having
gone
to
sleep
upon
his
left
side
abominable
faults
which
he
would
have
willingly
redeemed
by
wearing
out
his
knees
till
night
and
yet
happy
faults
in
that
they
kept
him
busy
for
without
them
he
would
have
no
occupation
for
his
unspotted
heart
steeped
in
a
life
of
purity
he
would
return
to
the
refectory
as
if
relieved
of
some
great
crime
the
seminarists
on
duty
wearing
blue
linen
aprons
and
having
their
cassock
sleeves
tucked
up
brought
in
the
vermicelli
soup
the
boiled
beef
cut
into
little
squares
and
the
helps
of
roast
mutton
and
french
beans
then
followed
a
terrific
rattling
of
jaws
a
gluttonous
silence
a
desperate
plying
of
forks
only
broken
by
envious
greedy
glances
at
the
horseshoe
table
where
the
heads
of
the
seminary
ate
more
delicate
meats
and
drank
ruddier
wines
and
all
the
while
above
the
hubbub
some
peasant
s
son
with
a
thick
voice
and
utter
disregard
for
punctuation
would
hem
and
haw
over
the
perusal
of
some
letters
from
missionaries
some
episcopal
pastoral
or
some
article
from
a
religious
paper
to
this
he
listened
as
he
ate
those
polemical
fragments
those
narratives
of
distant
travels
surprised
nay
even
frightened
him
with
their
revelations
of
bustling
boundless
fields
of
action
of
which
he
had
never
dreamt
beyond
the
seminary
walls
eating
was
still
in
progress
when
the
wooden
clapper
announced
the
recreation
hour
the
was
a
sandy
yard
in
which
stood
eight
which
in
summer
cast
cool
shadows
around
on
the
south
side
rose
a
wall
seventeen
feet
high
and
bristling
with
broken
glass
above
which
all
that
one
saw
of
plassans
was
the
steeple
of
mark
rising
like
a
stony
needle
against
the
blue
sky
to
and
fro
he
slowly
paced
the
court
with
a
row
of
and
each
time
he
faced
the
wall
he
eyed
that
spire
which
to
him
represented
the
whole
town
the
whole
earth
spread
beneath
the
scudding
clouds
noisy
groups
waxed
hot
in
disputation
round
the
friends
would
pair
off
in
the
corners
under
the
spying
glance
of
some
director
concealed
behind
his
tennis
and
skittle
matches
would
be
quickly
organised
to
the
great
discomfort
of
quiet
loto
players
who
lounged
on
the
ground
before
their
cardboard
squares
which
some
bowl
or
ball
would
suddenly
smother
with
sand
but
when
the
bell
sounded
the
noise
ceased
a
flight
of
sparrows
rose
from
the
and
the
breathless
students
betook
themselves
to
their
lesson
in
with
folded
arms
and
hanging
heads
and
thus
serge
s
day
closed
in
peacefulness
he
returned
to
his
work
then
at
four
o
clock
he
partook
of
his
afternoon
snack
and
renewed
his
everlasting
walk
in
sight
of
mark
s
spire
supper
was
marked
by
the
same
rattling
of
jaws
and
the
same
droning
perusal
as
the
midday
meal
and
when
it
was
over
serge
repaired
to
the
chapel
to
attend
prayers
and
finally
betook
himself
to
bed
at
a
quarter
past
eight
after
first
sprinkling
his
pallet
with
holy
water
to
ward
off
all
evil
dreams
how
many
delightful
days
like
these
had
he
not
spent
in
that
ancient
convent
of
old
plassans
where
abode
the
aroma
of
centuries
of
piety
for
five
years
had
the
days
followed
one
another
flowing
on
with
the
unvarying
murmur
of
limpid
water
in
this
present
hour
he
recalled
a
thousand
little
incidents
which
moved
him
he
remembered
going
with
his
mother
to
purchase
his
first
outfit
his
two
cassocks
his
two
waist
sashes
his
bands
his
eight
pairs
of
socks
his
surplice
and
his
hat
and
how
his
heart
had
beaten
that
mild
october
evening
when
the
seminary
door
had
first
closed
behind
him
he
had
gone
thither
at
twenty
after
his
school
years
seized
with
a
yearning
to
believe
and
love
the
very
next
day
he
had
forgotten
all
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
a
long
sleep
in
that
big
silent
house
he
once
more
saw
the
narrow
cell
in
which
he
had
lived
through
his
two
years
as
student
of
philosophy
a
little
hutch
with
only
a
bed
a
table
and
a
chair
divided
from
the
other
cells
by
badly
fitted
partitions
in
a
vast
hall
containing
about
fifty
similar
little
dens
and
he
again
saw
the
cell
he
had
dwelt
in
three
years
longer
while
in
the
theology
class
a
larger
one
with
an
armchair
a
and
a
bookcase
a
happy
room
full
of
the
dreams
which
his
faith
had
evoked
down
those
endless
passages
up
those
stairs
of
stone
in
all
sorts
of
nooks
sudden
inspirations
unexpected
aid
had
come
to
him
from
the
lofty
ceilings
fell
the
voices
of
guardian
angels
there
was
not
a
flagstone
in
the
halls
not
an
ashlar
of
the
walls
not
a
bough
of
the
but
it
spoke
to
him
of
the
delights
of
his
contemplative
life
his
lispings
of
tenderness
his
gradual
initiation
the
favours
vouchsafed
him
in
return
for
all
that
happiness
of
divine
first
love
on
such
and
such
a
day
on
awaking
he
had
beheld
a
bright
flood
of
light
which
had
steeped
him
in
joy
on
such
and
such
an
evening
as
he
closed
the
door
of
his
cell
he
had
felt
warm
hands
clasping
his
neck
so
lovingly
that
he
had
lost
consciousness
and
had
afterwards
found
himself
on
the
floor
weeping
and
choked
by
sobs
again
at
other
times
especially
in
the
little
archway
leading
to
the
chapel
he
had
surrendered
himself
to
supple
arms
which
raised
him
from
the
ground
all
heaven
had
then
been
concerned
in
him
had
moved
round
him
and
imparted
to
his
slightest
actions
a
peculiar
sense
an
astonishing
perfume
which
seemed
to
cling
faintly
to
his
clothes
to
his
very
skin
and
again
he
remembered
the
thursday
walks
they
started
at
two
o
clock
for
some
verdant
nook
about
three
miles
from
plassans
often
they
sought
a
meadow
on
the
banks
of
the
viorne
where
the
gnarled
willows
steeped
their
leaves
in
the
stream
but
he
saw
nothing
neither
the
big
yellow
flowers
in
the
meadow
nor
the
swallows
sipping
as
they
flew
by
with
wings
lightly
touching
the
surface
of
the
little
river
till
six
o
clock
seated
in
groups
beneath
the
willows
his
comrades
and
himself
recited
the
office
of
the
virgin
in
common
or
read
in
pairs
the
little
hours
the
book
of
prayers
recommended
to
young
seminarists
but
not
enjoined
on
them
abbe
mouret
smiled
as
he
stirred
the
burning
embers
of
his
fire
in
all
that
past
he
only
found
great
purity
and
perfect
obedience
he
had
been
a
lily
whose
sweet
scent
had
charmed
his
masters
he
could
not
recall
a
single
bad
action
he
had
never
taken
advantage
of
the
absolute
freedom
of
those
walks
when
the
two
prefects
in
charge
would
go
off
to
have
a
chat
with
a
parish
priest
in
the
neighbourhood
or
to
have
a
smoke
behind
a
hedge
or
to
drink
beer
with
a
friend
never
had
he
hidden
a
novel
under
his
mattress
nor
a
bottle
of
in
a
cupboard
for
a
long
time
even
he
had
had
no
suspicion
of
the
sinfulness
around
him
of
the
wings
of
chicken
and
the
cakes
smuggled
into
the
seminary
in
lent
of
the
guilty
letters
brought
in
by
servers
of
the
abominable
conversations
carried
on
in
whispers
in
certain
corners
of
the
courtyard
he
had
wept
hot
tears
when
he
first
perceived
that
few
among
his
fellows
loved
god
for
his
own
sake
there
were
peasants
sons
there
who
had
taken
orders
simply
through
their
terror
of
conscription
sluggards
who
dreamed
of
a
career
of
idleness
and
ambitious
youths
already
agitated
by
a
vision
of
the
staff
and
the
mitre
and
when
he
found
the
world
s
wickedness
reappearing
at
the
altar
s
very
foot
he
had
withdrawn
still
further
into
himself
giving
himself
still
more
to
god
to
console
him
for
being
forsaken
he
did
recollect
however
that
he
had
crossed
his
legs
one
day
in
class
and
that
when
the
professor
reproved
him
for
it
his
face
had
become
fiery
red
as
if
he
had
committed
some
abominable
action
he
was
one
of
the
best
students
never
arguing
but
learning
his
texts
by
heart
he
established
the
existence
and
eternity
of
god
by
proofs
drawn
from
holy
writ
the
opinions
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
the
universal
consensus
of
all
mankind
this
kind
of
reasoning
filled
him
with
an
unshakeable
certainty
during
his
first
year
of
philosophy
he
had
worked
at
his
logic
so
earnestly
that
his
professor
had
checked
him
remarking
that
the
most
learned
were
not
the
holiest
in
his
second
year
therefore
he
had
carried
out
his
study
of
metaphysics
as
a
regulation
task
constituting
but
a
small
fraction
of
his
daily
duties
he
felt
a
growing
contempt
for
science
he
wished
to
remain
ignorant
in
order
to
preserve
the
humility
of
his
faith
later
on
he
only
followed
the
course
of
rohrbacher
s
ecclesiastical
history
from
submission
he
ventured
as
far
as
gousset
s
arguments
and
bouvier
s
theological
course
without
daring
to
take
up
bellarmin
liguori
suarez
or
thomas
aquinas
holy
writ
alone
impassioned
him
therein
he
found
all
desirable
knowledge
a
tale
of
infinite
love
which
should
be
sufficient
instruction
for
all
men
of
he
simply
adopted
the
dicta
of
his
teachers
casting
on
them
the
care
of
inquiry
needing
nought
of
such
rubbish
to
know
how
to
love
and
accusing
books
of
stealing
away
the
time
which
should
be
devoted
to
prayer
he
even
succeeded
in
forgetting
his
years
of
college
life
he
no
longer
knew
anything
but
was
simplicity
itself
a
child
brought
back
to
the
lispings
of
his
catechism
such
was
the
manner
in
which
he
had
ascended
step
by
step
to
the
priesthood
and
here
his
recollections
thronged
more
quickly
on
him
softer
still
warm
with
heavenly
joy
each
year
he
had
drawn
nearer
to
god
his
vacations
had
been
spent
in
holy
fashion
at
an
uncle
s
in
confessions
every
day
and
communions
twice
a
week
he
would
lay
fasts
upon
himself
hide
inside
his
trunk
and
kneel
on
it
with
bared
knees
for
hours
together
at
recreation
time
he
remained
in
chapel
or
went
up
to
the
room
of
one
of
the
directors
who
told
him
pious
and
extraordinary
stories
then
as
the
fast
of
the
holy
trinity
drew
nigh
he
was
rewarded
beyond
all
measure
overwhelmed
by
the
stirring
emotion
which
pervades
all
seminaries
on
the
eve
of
ordinations
this
was
the
great
festival
of
all
when
the
sky
opened
to
allow
the
elect
to
rise
another
step
nearer
unto
god
for
a
fortnight
in
advance
he
imposed
a
bread
and
water
diet
on
himself
he
closed
his
window
blinds
so
that
he
might
not
see
the
daylight
at
all
and
he
prostrated
himself
in
the
gloom
to
implore
jesus
to
accept
his
sacrifice
during
the
last
four
days
he
suffered
torturing
pangs
terrible
scruples
which
would
force
him
from
his
bed
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
knock
at
the
door
of
some
strange
priest
giving
the
retreat
some
barefooted
carmelite
or
often
a
converted
protestant
respecting
whom
some
wonderful
story
was
current
to
him
he
would
make
at
great
length
a
general
confession
of
his
whole
life
in
a
voice
choking
with
sobs
absolution
alone
quieted
him
refreshed
him
as
if
he
had
enjoyed
a
bath
of
grace
on
the
morning
of
the
great
day
he
felt
wholly
white
and
so
vividly
was
he
conscious
of
his
whiteness
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
shed
light
around
him
the
seminary
bell
rang
out
in
clear
notes
while
all
the
scents
of
june
the
perfume
of
blossoming
stocks
of
mignonette
and
of
heliotropes
came
over
the
lofty
courtyard
wall
in
the
chapel
relatives
were
waiting
in
their
best
attire
so
deeply
moved
that
the
women
sobbed
behind
their
veils
next
came
the
procession
the
deacons
about
to
receive
their
priesthood
in
golden
chasubles
the
in
dalmatics
those
in
minor
orders
and
the
tonsured
with
their
surplices
floating
on
their
shoulders
and
their
black
birettas
in
their
hands
the
organ
rolled
diffusing
the
flutelike
notes
of
a
canticle
of
joy
at
the
altar
the
bishop
officiated
staff
in
hand
assisted
by
two
canons
all
the
chapter
were
there
the
priests
of
all
the
parishes
thronged
thick
amid
a
dazzling
wealth
of
apparel
a
flaring
of
gold
beneath
a
broad
ray
of
sunlight
falling
from
a
window
in
the
nave
the
epistle
over
the
ordination
began
at
this
very
hour
abbe
mouret
could
remember
the
chill
of
the
scissors
when
he
was
marked
with
the
tonsure
at
the
beginning
of
his
first
year
of
theology
it
had
made
him
shudder
slightly
but
the
tonsure
had
then
been
very
small
hardly
larger
than
a
penny
later
with
each
fresh
order
conferred
on
him
it
had
grown
and
grown
until
it
crowned
him
with
a
white
spot
as
large
as
a
big
host
the
organ
s
hum
grew
softer
and
the
censers
swung
with
a
silvery
tinkling
of
their
slender
chains
releasing
a
cloudlet
of
white
smoke
which
unrolled
in
lacelike
folds
he
could
see
himself
a
tonsured
youth
in
a
surplice
led
to
the
altar
by
the
master
of
ceremonies
there
he
knelt
and
bowed
his
head
down
low
while
the
bishop
with
golden
scissors
snipped
off
three
locks
one
over
his
forehead
and
the
other
two
near
his
ears
yet
another
twelvemonth
and
he
could
again
see
himself
in
the
chapel
amid
the
incense
receiving
the
four
minor
orders
led
by
an
archdeacon
he
went
to
the
main
doorway
closed
the
door
with
a
bang
and
opened
it
again
to
show
that
to
him
was
entrusted
the
care
of
churches
next
he
rang
a
small
bell
with
his
right
hand
in
token
that
it
was
his
duty
to
call
the
faithful
to
the
divine
offices
then
he
returned
to
the
altar
where
fresh
privileges
were
conferred
upon
him
by
the
bishop
those
of
singing
the
lessons
of
blessing
the
bread
of
catechising
children
of
exorcising
evil
spirits
of
serving
the
deacons
of
lighting
and
extinguishing
the
candles
of
the
altars
next
came
back
the
memory
of
the
ensuing
ordination
more
solemn
and
more
dread
amid
the
same
organ
strains
which
sounded
now
like
god
s
own
thunder
this
time
he
wore
a
s
dalmatic
upon
his
shoulders
he
bound
himself
for
ever
by
the
vow
of
chastity
he
trembled
in
every
pore
despite
his
faith
at
the
terrible
from
the
bishop
which
put
to
flight
two
of
his
companions
blanching
by
his
side
his
new
duties
were
to
serve
the
priest
at
the
altar
to
prepare
the
cruets
sing
the
epistle
wipe
the
chalice
and
carry
the
cross
in
processions
and
at
last
he
passed
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
into
the
chapel
in
the
radiance
of
a
june
sun
but
this
time
he
walked
at
the
very
head
of
the
procession
with
alb
girdled
about
his
waist
with
stole
crossed
over
his
breast
and
chasuble
falling
from
his
neck
all
but
fainting
from
emotion
he
could
perceive
the
pallid
face
of
the
bishop
giving
him
the
priesthood
the
fulness
of
the
ministry
by
the
threefold
laying
of
his
hands
and
after
taking
the
oath
of
ecclesiastical
obedience
he
felt
himself
uplifted
from
the
stone
flags
when
the
prelate
in
a
full
voice
repeated
the
latin
words
spiritum
sanctum
quorum
remiseris
peccata
remittuntur
eis
et
quorum
retinueris
retenta
receive
the
holy
ghost
whose
sins
thou
dost
forgive
they
are
forgiven
and
whose
sins
thou
dost
retain
they
are
xvi
this
evocation
of
the
deep
joys
of
his
youth
had
given
abbe
mouret
a
touch
of
feverishness
he
no
longer
felt
the
cold
he
put
down
the
tongs
and
walked
towards
the
bedstead
as
if
about
to
go
to
bed
but
turned
back
and
pressed
his
forehead
to
a
looking
out
into
the
night
with
sightless
eyes
could
he
be
ill
why
did
he
feel
such
languor
in
all
his
limbs
why
did
his
blood
burn
in
every
vein
on
two
occasions
while
at
the
seminary
he
had
experienced
similar
attacks
a
sort
of
physical
discomfort
which
made
him
most
unhappy
one
day
indeed
he
had
gone
to
bed
in
raving
delirium
then
he
bethought
himself
of
a
young
girl
possessed
by
evil
spirits
whom
brother
archangias
asserted
he
had
cured
with
a
simple
sign
of
the
cross
one
day
when
she
fell
down
before
him
this
reminded
him
of
the
spiritual
exorcisms
which
one
of
his
teachers
had
formerly
recommended
to
him
prayer
a
general
confession
frequent
communion
the
choosing
of
a
wise
confessor
who
should
have
great
authority
on
his
mind
and
then
without
any
transition
with
a
suddenness
which
astonished
himself
he
saw
in
the
depths
of
his
memory
the
round
face
of
one
of
his
old
friends
a
peasant
who
had
been
a
choir
boy
at
eight
years
old
and
whose
expenses
at
the
seminary
were
defrayed
by
a
lady
who
watched
over
him
he
was
always
laughing
he
rejoiced
beforehand
at
the
anticipated
emoluments
of
his
career
twelve
hundred
francs
of
stipend
a
vicarage
at
the
end
of
a
garden
presents
invitations
to
dinners
little
profits
from
weddings
and
baptismal
and
burial
fees
that
young
fellow
must
indeed
be
happy
in
his
parish
the
feeling
of
melancholy
regret
evoked
by
this
recollection
surprised
abbe
mouret
extremely
was
he
not
happy
too
until
that
day
he
had
regretted
nothing
wished
for
nothing
envied
nothing
even
as
he
searched
himself
at
that
very
moment
he
failed
to
find
any
cause
for
bitterness
he
believed
himself
the
same
as
in
the
early
days
of
his
deaconship
when
the
obligatory
perusal
of
his
breviary
at
certain
stated
hours
had
filled
his
days
with
continuous
prayer
no
doubts
had
tormented
him
he
had
prostrated
himself
before
the
mysteries
he
could
not
understand
he
had
sacrificed
his
reason
which
he
despised
with
the
greatest
ease
when
he
left
the
seminary
he
had
rejoiced
at
finding
himself
a
stranger
among
his
fellowmen
no
longer
walking
like
them
carrying
his
head
differently
possessed
of
the
gestures
words
and
opinions
of
a
being
apart
he
had
felt
emasculated
nearer
to
the
angels
cleansed
of
sexuality
it
had
almost
made
him
proud
to
belong
no
longer
to
his
species
to
have
been
brought
up
for
god
and
carefully
purged
of
all
human
grossness
by
a
jealously
watchful
training
again
it
had
seemed
to
him
as
if
for
years
he
had
been
dwelling
in
holy
oil
prepared
with
all
due
rites
which
had
steeped
his
flesh
in
beatification
his
limbs
his
brain
had
lost
material
substance
to
gain
in
soulfulness
impregnated
with
a
subtle
vapour
which
at
times
intoxicated
him
and
dizzied
him
as
if
the
earth
had
suddenly
failed
beneath
his
feet
he
displayed
the
fears
the
unwittingness
the
open
candour
of
a
cloistered
maiden
he
sometimes
remarked
with
a
smile
that
he
was
prolonging
his
childhood
under
the
impression
that
he
was
still
quite
little
retaining
the
same
sensations
the
same
ideas
the
same
opinions
as
in
the
past
at
six
years
old
for
instance
he
had
known
as
much
of
god
as
he
knew
at
in
prayer
the
inflexions
of
his
voice
were
still
the
same
and
he
yet
took
a
childish
pleasure
in
folding
his
hands
quite
correctly
the
world
too
seemed
to
him
the
same
as
he
had
seen
in
former
days
when
his
mother
led
him
by
the
hand
he
had
been
born
a
priest
and
a
priest
he
had
grown
up
whenever
he
displayed
before
la
teuse
some
particularly
gross
ignorance
of
life
she
would
stare
him
in
the
face
astounded
and
remark
with
a
strange
smile
that
he
was
mademoiselle
desiree
s
brother
all
in
all
his
existence
he
could
only
recall
one
shock
of
shame
it
had
happened
during
his
last
six
months
at
the
seminary
between
his
deaconship
and
priesthood
he
had
been
ordered
to
read
the
work
of
abbe
craisson
the
superior
of
the
great
seminary
at
valence
rebus
veneris
ad
usum
and
he
had
risen
from
this
book
terrified
and
choking
with
sobs
that
learned
casuistry
dealing
so
fully
with
the
abominations
of
mankind
descending
to
the
most
monstrous
examples
of
vice
violated
as
it
were
all
his
virginity
of
body
and
mind
he
felt
himself
for
ever
befouled
yet
every
time
he
heard
confessions
he
inevitably
recurred
to
that
catechism
of
shame
and
though
the
obscurities
of
dogma
the
duties
of
his
ministry
and
the
death
of
all
free
will
within
him
left
him
calm
and
happy
at
being
nought
but
the
child
of
god
he
retained
in
spite
of
himself
a
carnal
taint
of
the
horrors
he
must
needs
stir
up
he
was
conscious
of
an
ineffaceable
stain
deep
down
somewhere
in
his
being
which
might
some
day
grow
larger
and
cover
him
with
mud
the
moon
was
rising
behind
the
garrigue
hills
abbe
mouret
still
more
and
more
feverish
opened
the
window
and
leaned
out
upon
his
elbows
that
he
might
feel
upon
his
face
the
coolness
of
the
night
he
could
no
longer
remember
at
what
time
exactly
this
illness
had
come
upon
him
he
recollected
however
that
in
the
morning
while
saying
mass
he
had
been
quite
calm
and
restful
it
must
have
been
later
perhaps
during
his
long
walk
in
the
sun
or
while
he
shivered
under
the
trees
of
the
paradou
or
while
stifling
in
desiree
s
and
then
he
lived
through
the
day
again
before
him
stretched
the
vast
plain
more
direful
still
beneath
the
pallid
light
of
the
oblique
moonbeams
the
olive
and
almond
trees
showed
like
grey
spots
amid
the
chaos
of
rocks
spreading
to
the
sombre
row
of
hills
on
the
horizon
there
were
big
splotches
of
gloom
bumpy
ridges
earthy
pools
in
which
red
stars
seemed
to
contemplate
one
another
patches
of
chalky
light
suggestive
of
women
s
garments
cast
off
and
disclosing
shadowy
forms
which
slumbered
in
the
hollow
folds
of
ground
at
night
that
glowing
landscape
weltered
there
strangely
passionately
slumbering
with
uncovered
bosom
and
outspread
twisted
limbs
whilst
heaving
mighty
sighs
and
exhaling
the
strong
aroma
of
a
sweating
sleeper
it
was
as
if
some
mighty
cybele
had
fallen
there
beneath
the
moon
intoxicated
with
the
embraces
of
the
sun
far
away
abbe
mouret
s
eyes
followed
the
path
to
les
olivettes
a
narrow
pale
ribbon
stretching
along
like
a
wavy
he
could
hear
brother
archangias
whipping
the
truant
schoolgirls
and
spitting
in
the
faces
of
their
elder
sisters
he
could
see
rosalie
slyly
laughing
in
her
hands
while
old
bambousse
hurled
clods
of
earth
after
her
and
smote
her
on
her
hips
then
too
he
thought
he
had
still
been
well
his
neck
barely
heated
by
the
lovely
morning
sunshine
he
had
felt
but
a
quivering
behind
him
that
confused
hum
of
life
which
he
had
faintly
heard
since
morning
when
the
sun
in
the
midst
of
his
mass
had
entered
the
church
by
the
shattered
windows
never
then
had
the
country
disturbed
him
as
it
did
at
this
hour
of
night
with
its
giant
bosom
its
yielding
shadows
its
gleams
of
ambery
skin
its
lavish
nudity
scarce
hidden
by
the
silvery
gauze
of
moonlight
the
young
priest
lowered
his
eyes
and
gazed
upon
the
village
of
les
artaud
it
had
sunk
into
the
heavy
slumber
of
weariness
the
soundness
of
peasants
sleep
not
a
light
the
battered
hovels
showed
like
dusky
mounds
intersected
by
the
white
stripes
of
cross
lanes
which
the
moonbeams
swept
even
the
dogs
were
surely
snoring
on
the
thresholds
of
the
closed
doors
had
the
artauds
poisoned
the
air
of
the
parsonage
with
some
abominable
plague
behind
him
gathered
and
swept
the
gust
whose
approach
filled
him
with
so
much
anguish
now
he
could
detect
a
sound
like
the
tramping
of
a
flock
a
whiff
of
dusty
air
which
reached
him
laden
with
the
emanations
of
beasts
again
came
back
his
thoughts
of
a
handful
of
men
beginning
the
centuries
over
again
springing
up
between
those
naked
rocks
like
thistles
sown
by
the
winds
in
his
childhood
nothing
had
amazed
and
frightened
him
more
than
those
myriads
of
insects
which
gushed
forth
when
he
raised
certain
damp
stones
the
artauds
disturbed
him
even
in
their
slumber
he
could
recognise
their
breath
in
the
air
he
inhaled
he
would
have
liked
to
have
had
the
rocks
alone
below
his
window
the
hamlet
was
not
dead
enough
the
thatched
roofs
bulged
like
bosoms
through
the
gaping
cracks
in
the
doors
came
low
faint
sounds
which
spoke
of
all
the
swarming
life
within
nausea
came
upon
him
yet
he
had
often
faced
it
all
without
feeling
any
other
need
than
that
of
refreshing
himself
in
prayer
his
brow
perspiring
he
proceeded
to
open
the
other
window
as
if
to
seek
cooler
air
below
him
to
his
left
lay
the
graveyard
with
the
solitaire
erect
like
a
bar
unstirred
by
the
faintest
breeze
from
the
empty
field
arose
an
odour
like
that
of
a
newly
mown
meadow
the
grey
wall
of
the
church
that
wall
full
of
lizards
and
planted
with
gleamed
coldly
in
the
moonlight
and
the
panes
of
one
of
the
windows
glistened
like
plates
of
steel
the
sleeping
church
could
now
have
no
other
life
within
it
than
the
life
of
the
divinity
embodied
in
the
host
enclosed
in
the
tabernacle
he
thought
of
the
bracket
lamp
s
yellow
glow
peeping
out
of
the
gloom
and
was
tempted
to
go
down
once
more
to
try
to
ease
his
ailing
head
amid
those
deep
shadows
but
a
strange
feeling
of
terror
held
him
back
he
suddenly
fancied
while
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
moonlit
panes
that
he
saw
the
church
illumined
by
a
glare
the
blaze
of
a
festival
of
hell
in
which
whirled
the
month
of
may
the
plants
the
animals
and
the
girls
of
les
artaud
who
wildly
encircled
trees
with
their
bare
arms
then
as
he
leaned
over
he
saw
beneath
him
desiree
s
black
and
steaming
he
could
not
clearly
distinguish
the
the
fowls
or
the
ducks
house
the
place
was
all
one
big
mass
heaped
up
in
stench
still
exhaling
in
its
sleep
a
pestiferous
odour
from
under
the
came
the
acrid
smell
of
the
while
the
little
pig
stretched
upon
his
back
snorted
near
an
empty
porringer
and
suddenly
with
his
brazen
throat
alexander
the
big
yellow
cock
raised
a
crow
which
awoke
in
the
distance
impassioned
calls
from
all
the
cocks
of
the
village
then
all
at
once
abbe
mouret
remembered
the
fever
had
struck
him
in
desiree
s
farmyard
while
he
was
looking
at
the
hens
still
warm
from
laying
the
plucking
the
down
from
under
them
and
now
the
feeling
that
some
one
was
breathing
on
his
neck
became
so
distinct
that
he
turned
at
last
to
see
who
was
behind
him
and
then
he
recalled
albine
bounding
out
of
the
paradou
and
the
door
slamming
upon
the
vision
of
an
enchanted
garden
he
recalled
the
girl
racing
alongside
the
interminable
wall
following
the
gig
at
a
run
and
throwing
birch
leaves
to
the
breeze
as
kisses
he
recalled
her
again
in
the
twilight
laughing
at
the
oaths
of
brother
archangias
her
skirts
skimming
over
the
path
like
a
cloudlet
of
dust
bowled
along
by
the
evening
breeze
she
was
sixteen
how
strange
she
looked
with
her
rather
elongated
face
she
savoured
of
the
open
air
of
the
grass
of
mother
earth
and
so
accurate
was
his
recollection
of
her
that
he
could
once
more
see
a
scratch
upon
one
of
her
supple
wrists
a
rosy
scar
on
her
white
skin
why
did
she
laugh
like
that
when
she
looked
at
him
with
her
blue
eyes
he
was
engulfed
in
her
laugh
as
in
a
sonorous
wave
which
resounded
and
pressed
close
to
him
on
every
side
he
inhaled
it
he
felt
it
vibrate
within
him
yes
all
his
evil
came
from
that
laugh
of
hers
which
he
had
quaffed
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
both
windows
open
he
remained
shivering
seized
with
a
fright
which
made
him
hide
his
face
in
his
hands
so
this
was
the
ending
of
the
whole
day
this
evocation
of
a
fair
girl
with
a
somewhat
long
face
and
eyes
of
blue
and
the
whole
day
came
in
through
the
open
windows
in
the
distance
the
glow
of
those
red
lands
the
ardent
passion
of
the
big
rocks
of
the
springing
up
amid
the
stones
of
the
vines
twisting
their
arms
by
the
roadside
nearer
the
steam
of
human
sweat
borne
in
upon
the
air
from
les
artaud
the
musty
odour
of
the
cemetery
the
fragrance
of
incense
from
the
church
tainted
by
the
scent
of
wenches
and
there
was
also
the
steaming
the
fumes
of
the
the
oppressing
ferment
of
animal
germs
and
all
these
vapours
poured
in
at
once
in
one
asphyxiating
gust
so
offensive
so
violent
as
to
choke
him
he
tried
to
close
his
senses
to
subdue
and
annihilate
them
but
albine
reappeared
before
him
like
a
tall
flower
that
had
sprung
and
grown
beautiful
in
that
soil
she
was
the
natural
blossom
of
that
corruption
delicate
in
the
sunshine
her
white
shoulders
expanding
in
youthfulness
her
whole
being
so
fraught
with
the
gladness
of
life
that
she
leaped
from
her
stem
and
darted
upon
his
mouth
scenting
him
with
her
long
ripple
of
laughter
a
cry
burst
from
the
priest
he
had
felt
a
burning
touch
upon
his
lips
a
stream
as
of
fire
coursed
through
his
veins
and
then
in
search
of
refuge
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
statuette
of
the
immaculate
conception
exclaiming
with
folded
hands
holy
virgin
of
virgins
pray
for
me
xvii
the
immaculate
conception
set
on
the
walnut
chest
of
drawers
was
smiling
softly
with
her
slender
lips
marked
by
a
dash
of
carmine
her
form
was
small
and
wholly
white
her
long
white
veil
falling
from
head
to
foot
had
but
an
imperceptible
thread
of
gold
around
its
edge
her
gown
draped
in
long
straight
folds
over
a
sexless
figure
was
fastened
around
her
flexible
neck
not
a
single
lock
of
her
chestnut
hair
peeped
forth
her
countenance
was
rosy
with
clear
eyes
upturned
to
heaven
her
hands
were
clasped
rosy
childlike
hands
whose
appeared
beneath
the
folds
of
her
veil
above
the
azure
scarf
which
seemed
to
girdle
her
waist
with
two
streaming
ends
of
the
firmament
of
all
her
womanly
charms
not
one
was
bared
except
her
feet
adorable
feet
which
trod
the
mystical
eglantine
and
from
those
nude
feet
sprang
golden
roses
like
the
natural
efflorescence
of
her
twofold
purity
of
flesh
virgin
most
faithful
pray
for
me
the
priest
despairingly
pleaded
this
virgin
had
never
distressed
him
she
was
not
a
mother
yet
she
did
not
offer
jesus
to
him
her
figure
did
not
yet
present
the
rounded
outlines
of
maternity
she
was
not
the
queen
of
heaven
descending
crowned
with
gold
and
clothed
in
gold
like
a
princess
of
the
earth
borne
in
triumph
by
a
flight
of
cherubim
she
had
never
assumed
an
awesome
mien
had
never
spoken
to
him
with
the
austere
severity
of
an
mistress
the
very
sight
of
whom
must
bow
all
foreheads
to
the
dust
he
could
dare
to
look
on
her
and
love
her
without
fear
of
being
moved
by
the
gentle
wave
of
her
chestnut
hair
her
bare
feet
alone
excited
his
affection
those
feet
of
love
which
blossomed
like
a
garden
of
chastity
in
too
miraculous
a
manner
for
him
to
seek
to
cover
them
with
kisses
she
scented
his
room
with
fragrance
she
was
indeed
the
silver
lily
planted
in
a
golden
vase
she
was
precious
eternal
impeccable
purity
within
the
white
veil
so
closely
drawn
round
her
there
could
be
nothing
human
only
a
virgin
flame
burning
with
ever
even
glow
at
night
when
he
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
when
he
woke
he
could
see
her
there
still
and
ever
wearing
that
same
ecstatic
smile
mother
most
pure
mother
most
chaste
mother
pray
for
me
he
stammered
in
his
fear
pressing
close
to
the
virgin
s
feet
as
if
he
could
hear
albine
s
sonorous
footfalls
behind
him
you
are
my
refuge
the
source
of
my
joy
the
seat
of
my
wisdom
the
tower
of
ivory
in
which
i
have
shut
up
my
purity
i
place
myself
in
your
spotless
hands
i
beseech
you
to
take
me
to
cover
me
with
a
corner
of
your
veil
to
hide
me
beneath
your
innocence
behind
the
hallowed
rampart
of
your
garment
so
that
no
fleshly
breath
may
reach
me
i
need
you
i
die
without
you
i
shall
feel
for
ever
parted
from
you
if
you
do
not
bear
me
away
in
your
helpful
arms
far
hence
into
the
glowing
whiteness
wherein
you
dwell
o
mary
conceived
without
sin
annihilate
me
in
the
depths
of
the
immaculate
snow
that
falls
from
your
every
limb
you
are
the
miracle
of
eternal
chastity
your
race
has
sprung
from
a
very
beam
of
grace
like
some
wondrous
tree
unsown
by
any
germ
your
son
jesus
was
born
of
the
breath
of
god
you
yourself
were
born
without
defilement
of
your
mother
s
womb
and
i
would
believe
that
this
virginity
goes
back
thus
from
age
to
age
in
endless
unwittingness
of
flesh
oh
to
live
to
grow
up
outside
the
pale
of
the
senses
oh
to
perpetuate
life
solely
by
the
contact
of
a
celestial
kiss
this
despairing
appeal
this
cry
of
purified
longing
calmed
the
young
priest
s
fears
the
virgin
wholly
white
with
eyes
turned
heavenward
appeared
to
smile
more
tenderly
with
her
thin
red
lips
and
in
a
softened
voice
he
went
on
i
should
like
to
be
a
child
once
more
i
should
like
to
be
always
a
child
walking
in
the
shadow
of
your
gown
when
i
was
quite
little
i
clasped
my
hands
when
i
uttered
the
name
of
mary
my
cradle
was
white
my
body
was
white
my
every
thought
was
white
i
could
see
you
distinctly
i
could
hear
you
calling
me
i
went
towards
you
in
the
light
of
a
smile
over
scattered
and
nought
else
did
i
feel
or
think
i
lived
but
just
enough
to
be
a
flower
at
your
feet
no
one
should
grow
up
you
would
have
around
you
none
but
fair
young
heads
a
crowd
of
children
who
would
love
you
with
pure
hands
unsullied
lips
tender
limbs
stainless
as
if
fresh
from
a
bath
of
milk
to
kiss
a
child
s
cheek
is
to
kiss
its
soul
a
child
alone
can
say
your
name
without
befouling
it
in
later
years
our
lips
grow
tainted
and
reek
of
our
passions
even
i
who
love
you
so
much
and
have
given
myself
to
you
i
dare
not
at
all
times
call
on
you
for
i
would
not
let
you
come
in
contact
with
the
impurities
of
my
manhood
i
have
prayed
and
chastised
my
flesh
i
have
slept
in
your
keeping
and
lived
in
chastity
and
yet
i
weep
to
see
that
i
am
not
yet
dead
enough
to
this
world
to
be
your
betrothed
o
mary
adorable
virgin
why
can
i
not
be
only
five
years
old
why
could
i
not
remain
the
child
who
pressed
his
lips
to
your
pictures
i
would
take
you
to
my
heart
i
would
lay
you
by
my
side
i
would
clasp
and
kiss
you
like
a
friend
like
a
girl
of
my
own
age
your
close
hanging
garments
your
childish
veil
your
blue
scarf
all
that
youthfulness
which
makes
you
like
an
elder
sister
would
be
mine
i
would
not
try
to
kiss
your
locks
for
hair
is
a
naked
thing
which
should
not
be
seen
but
i
would
kiss
your
bare
feet
one
after
the
other
for
nights
and
nights
together
until
my
lips
should
have
shred
the
petals
of
those
golden
roses
those
mystical
roses
of
our
he
stopped
waiting
for
the
virgin
to
look
down
upon
him
and
touch
his
forehead
with
the
edges
of
her
veil
but
she
remained
enwrapped
in
muslin
to
her
neck
and
and
ankles
so
slim
so
etherealised
that
she
already
seemed
to
be
above
earth
to
be
wholly
heaven
s
own
well
then
he
went
on
more
wildly
still
grant
that
i
become
a
child
again
o
kindly
virgin
virgin
most
powerful
grant
that
i
may
be
only
five
years
old
rid
me
of
my
senses
rid
me
of
my
manhood
let
a
miracle
sweep
away
all
the
man
that
has
grown
up
within
me
you
reign
in
heaven
nothing
is
easier
to
you
than
to
change
me
to
rid
me
of
all
my
strength
so
that
evermore
i
may
be
unable
to
raise
my
little
finger
without
your
leave
i
wish
never
more
to
feel
either
nerve
or
muscle
or
the
beating
of
my
heart
i
long
to
be
simply
a
thing
a
white
stone
at
your
feet
on
which
you
will
leave
but
a
perfume
a
stone
that
will
not
move
from
where
you
cast
it
but
will
remain
earless
and
eyeless
content
to
lie
beneath
your
heel
unable
to
think
of
foulness
oh
then
what
bliss
for
me
i
shall
reach
without
an
effort
and
at
a
bound
my
dream
of
perfection
i
shall
at
last
proclaim
myself
your
true
priest
i
shall
become
what
all
my
studies
my
prayers
my
five
years
of
initiation
have
been
unable
to
make
me
yes
i
reject
life
i
say
that
the
death
of
mankind
is
better
than
abomination
everything
is
stained
everywhere
is
love
tainted
earth
is
steeped
in
impurity
whose
slightest
drops
yield
growths
of
shame
but
that
i
may
be
perfect
o
queen
of
angels
hearken
to
my
prayer
and
grant
it
make
me
one
of
those
angels
that
have
only
two
great
wings
behind
their
cheeks
i
shall
then
no
longer
have
a
body
no
longer
have
any
limbs
i
will
fly
to
you
if
you
call
me
i
shall
be
but
a
mouth
to
sing
your
praises
a
pair
of
spotless
wings
to
cradle
you
in
your
journeys
through
the
heavens
o
death
death
virgin
most
venerable
grant
me
the
death
of
all
i
will
love
you
for
the
death
of
my
body
the
death
of
all
that
lives
and
multiplies
i
will
consummate
with
you
the
sole
marriage
that
my
heart
desires
i
will
ascend
ever
higher
and
higher
till
i
have
reached
the
brasier
in
which
you
shine
in
splendour
there
one
beholds
a
mighty
planet
an
immense
white
rose
whose
every
petal
glows
like
a
moon
a
silver
throne
whence
you
beam
with
such
a
blaze
of
innocence
that
heaven
itself
is
all
illumined
by
the
gleam
of
your
veil
alone
all
that
is
white
the
early
dawns
the
snow
on
inaccessible
peaks
the
lilies
barely
opening
the
water
of
hidden
unknown
springs
the
milky
sap
of
the
plants
untouched
by
the
sun
the
smiles
of
maidens
the
souls
of
children
dead
in
their
cradles
all
rains
upon
your
white
feet
and
i
will
rise
to
your
mouth
like
a
subtle
flame
i
will
enter
into
you
by
your
parted
lips
and
the
bridal
will
be
fulfilled
while
the
archangels
are
thrilled
by
our
joyfulness
oh
to
be
maiden
to
love
in
maidenhood
to
preserve
amid
the
sweetest
kisses
one
s
maiden
whiteness
to
possess
all
love
stretched
on
the
wings
of
swans
in
a
sky
of
purity
in
the
arms
of
a
mistress
of
light
whose
caresses
are
but
raptures
of
the
soul
oh
there
lies
the
perfection
the
dream
the
yearning
which
shatters
my
very
bones
the
joy
which
bears
me
up
to
heaven
o
mary
vessel
of
election
rid
me
of
all
that
is
human
in
me
so
that
you
may
fearlessly
surrender
to
me
the
treasure
of
your
maidenhood
and
then
abbe
mouret
felled
by
fever
his
teeth
chattering
swooned
away
on
the
floor
book
ii
i
through
calico
curtains
carefully
drawn
across
the
two
large
windows
a
pale
white
light
like
that
of
breaking
day
filtered
into
the
room
it
was
a
lofty
and
spacious
room
fitted
up
with
old
louis
xv
furniture
the
woodwork
painted
white
the
upholstery
showing
a
pattern
of
red
flowers
on
a
leafy
ground
on
the
piers
above
the
doors
on
either
side
of
the
alcove
were
faded
paintings
still
displaying
the
rosy
flesh
of
flying
cupids
whose
games
it
was
now
impossible
to
follow
the
wainscoting
with
oval
panels
the
folding
doors
the
rounded
ceiling
once
and
framed
with
scrolls
medallions
and
bows
of
ribbons
had
all
faded
to
the
softest
grey
opposite
the
windows
the
large
alcove
opened
beneath
banks
of
clouds
which
plaster
cupids
drew
aside
leaning
over
and
peeping
saucily
towards
the
bed
and
like
the
windows
the
alcove
was
curtained
with
coarsely
hemmed
calico
whose
simplicity
seemed
strange
in
this
room
where
lingered
a
perfume
of
whilom
luxury
and
voluptuousness
seated
near
a
pier
table
on
which
a
little
kettle
bubbled
over
a
albine
intently
watched
the
alcove
curtains
she
was
gowned
in
white
her
hair
gathered
up
in
an
old
lace
kerchief
her
hands
drooping
wearily
as
she
kept
watch
with
the
serious
mien
of
youthful
womanhood
a
faint
breathing
like
that
of
a
slumbering
child
could
be
heard
in
the
deep
silence
but
she
grew
restless
after
a
few
minutes
and
could
not
restrain
herself
from
stepping
lightly
towards
the
alcove
and
raising
one
of
the
curtains
on
the
edge
of
the
big
bed
lay
serge
apparently
asleep
with
his
head
resting
on
his
bent
arm
during
his
illness
his
hair
had
lengthened
and
his
beard
had
grown
he
looked
very
white
with
sunken
eyes
and
pallid
lips
moved
by
the
sight
albine
was
about
to
let
the
curtain
fall
again
but
serge
faintly
murmured
i
am
not
he
lay
perfectly
still
with
his
head
on
his
arm
without
stirring
even
a
finger
as
if
overwhelmed
by
delightful
weariness
his
eyes
had
slowly
opened
and
his
breath
blew
lightly
on
one
of
his
hands
raising
the
golden
down
on
his
fair
skin
i
heard
you
he
murmured
again
you
were
walking
very
from
this
point
in
the
original
serge
and
albine
thee
and
thou
one
another
but
although
this
has
some
bearing
on
the
development
of
the
story
it
was
impossible
to
preserve
it
in
an
english
ed
his
voice
enchanted
her
she
went
up
to
his
bed
and
crouched
beside
it
to
bring
her
face
on
a
level
with
his
own
how
are
you
she
asked
and
then
continued
oh
you
are
well
now
do
you
know
i
used
to
cry
the
whole
way
home
when
i
came
back
from
over
yonder
with
bad
news
of
you
they
told
me
you
were
delirious
and
that
if
your
dreadful
fever
did
spare
your
life
it
would
destroy
your
reason
oh
didn
t
i
kiss
your
uncle
pascal
when
he
brought
you
here
to
recruit
your
health
then
she
tucked
in
his
like
a
young
mother
those
rocks
over
yonder
you
see
were
no
good
to
you
you
need
trees
and
coolness
and
quiet
the
doctor
hasn
t
even
told
a
soul
that
he
was
hiding
you
away
here
that
s
a
secret
between
himself
and
those
who
love
you
he
thought
you
were
lost
nobody
will
ever
disturb
you
you
may
be
sure
of
that
uncle
jeanbernat
is
smoking
his
pipe
by
his
lettuce
bed
the
others
will
get
news
of
you
on
the
sly
even
the
doctor
isn
t
coming
back
any
more
i
am
to
be
your
doctor
now
you
don
t
want
any
more
physic
it
seems
what
you
now
want
is
to
be
loved
do
you
see
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
her
his
brain
as
yet
was
void
his
eyes
although
his
head
remained
motionless
wandered
inquiringly
round
the
room
and
it
struck
her
that
he
was
wondering
where
he
might
be
this
is
my
room
she
said
i
have
given
it
to
you
isn
t
it
a
pretty
one
i
took
the
finest
pieces
of
furniture
out
of
the
lumber
attic
and
then
i
made
those
calico
curtains
to
prevent
the
daylight
from
dazzling
me
and
you
re
not
putting
me
out
a
bit
i
shall
sleep
on
the
second
floor
there
are
three
or
four
empty
rooms
still
he
looked
anxious
you
re
alone
he
asked
yes
why
do
you
ask
that
he
made
no
answer
but
muttered
wearily
i
have
been
dreaming
i
am
always
dreaming
i
hear
bells
ringing
and
they
tire
and
after
a
pause
he
went
on
go
and
shut
the
door
bolt
it
i
want
you
to
be
alone
quite
when
she
came
back
bringing
a
chair
with
her
and
sat
down
by
his
pillow
he
looked
as
gleeful
as
a
child
and
kept
on
saying
nobody
can
come
in
now
i
shall
not
hear
those
bells
any
more
when
you
are
talking
to
me
it
rests
would
you
like
something
to
drink
she
asked
he
made
a
sign
that
he
was
not
thirsty
he
looked
at
albine
s
hands
as
if
so
astonished
so
delighted
to
see
them
that
with
a
smile
she
laid
one
on
the
edge
of
his
pillow
then
he
let
his
head
glide
down
and
rested
his
cheek
against
that
small
cool
hand
saying
with
a
light
laugh
ah
it
s
as
soft
as
silk
it
is
just
as
if
it
were
sending
a
cool
breeze
through
my
hair
don
t
take
it
away
then
came
another
long
spell
of
silence
they
gazed
on
one
another
with
loving
kindliness
albine
calmly
scanning
herself
in
the
convalescent
s
eyes
serge
apparently
listening
to
some
faint
whisper
from
the
small
cool
hand
your
hand
is
so
nice
he
said
once
more
you
can
t
fancy
what
good
it
does
me
it
seems
to
steal
inside
me
and
take
away
all
the
pain
in
my
limbs
it
s
as
if
i
were
being
soothed
all
over
relieved
he
gently
rubbed
his
cheek
against
it
with
growing
animation
as
if
he
were
at
last
coming
back
to
life
you
won
t
give
me
anything
nasty
to
drink
will
you
you
won
t
worry
me
with
all
sorts
of
physic
your
hand
is
quite
enough
for
me
i
have
come
here
for
you
to
put
it
there
under
my
dear
serge
said
albine
softly
how
you
must
have
suffered
yes
yes
but
it
s
a
long
time
ago
i
slept
badly
i
had
such
frightful
dreams
if
i
could
i
would
tell
you
all
about
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
strove
hard
to
remember
i
can
see
nothing
but
darkness
he
stammered
it
is
very
odd
i
have
just
come
back
from
a
long
journey
i
don
t
even
know
now
where
i
started
from
i
had
fever
i
know
a
fever
that
raced
through
my
veins
like
a
wild
beast
that
was
it
now
i
remember
the
whole
time
i
had
a
nightmare
in
which
i
seemed
to
be
crawling
along
an
endless
underground
passage
and
every
now
and
then
i
had
an
attack
of
intolerable
pain
and
then
the
passage
would
be
suddenly
walled
up
a
shower
of
stones
fell
from
overhead
the
side
walls
closed
in
and
there
i
stuck
panting
mad
to
get
on
and
then
i
bored
into
the
obstacle
and
battered
away
with
feet
and
fists
and
skull
despairing
of
ever
being
able
to
get
through
the
ever
increasing
mound
of
rubbish
at
other
times
i
only
had
to
touch
it
with
my
finger
and
it
vanished
i
could
then
walk
freely
along
the
widened
gallery
weary
only
from
the
pangs
of
my
albine
tried
to
lay
a
hand
upon
his
lips
no
said
he
it
doesn
t
tire
me
to
talk
i
can
whisper
to
you
here
you
see
i
feel
as
if
i
were
thinking
and
you
could
hear
me
the
queerest
point
about
that
underground
journey
of
mine
was
that
i
hadn
t
the
faintest
idea
of
turning
back
again
i
got
obstinate
although
i
had
the
thought
before
me
that
it
would
take
me
thousands
of
years
to
clear
away
a
single
heap
of
wreckage
it
seemed
a
fated
task
which
i
had
to
fulfil
under
pain
of
the
greatest
misfortunes
so
with
my
knees
all
bruised
and
my
forehead
bumping
against
the
hard
rock
i
set
myself
to
work
with
all
my
might
so
that
i
might
get
to
the
end
as
quickly
as
possible
the
end
what
was
it
ah
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
he
closed
his
eyes
and
pondered
dreamily
then
with
a
careless
pout
he
again
sank
upon
albine
s
hand
and
said
laughing
how
silly
of
me
i
am
a
but
the
girl
to
ascertain
if
he
were
wholly
hers
questioned
him
and
led
him
back
to
the
confused
recollections
he
had
tried
to
summon
up
he
could
remember
nothing
however
he
was
truly
in
a
happy
state
of
childhood
he
fancied
that
he
had
been
born
the
day
before
oh
i
am
not
strong
enough
yet
he
said
my
furthest
recollection
is
of
a
bed
which
burned
me
all
over
my
head
rolled
about
on
a
pillow
like
a
pan
of
live
coals
and
my
feet
wore
away
with
perpetual
rubbing
against
each
other
i
was
very
bad
i
know
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
having
my
body
changed
as
if
i
were
being
taken
all
to
pieces
and
put
together
again
like
some
broken
he
laughed
at
this
simile
and
continued
i
shall
be
all
new
again
my
illness
has
given
me
a
fine
cleaning
but
what
was
it
you
were
asking
me
no
nobody
was
there
i
was
suffering
all
by
myself
at
the
bottom
of
a
black
hole
nobody
nobody
and
beyond
that
nothing
i
can
see
nothing
let
me
be
your
child
will
you
you
shall
teach
me
to
walk
i
can
see
nothing
else
but
you
now
i
care
for
nothing
but
you
i
can
t
remember
i
tell
you
i
came
you
took
me
and
that
is
and
restfully
pettingly
he
said
once
more
how
warm
your
hand
is
now
it
is
as
nice
as
the
sun
don
t
let
us
talk
any
more
it
makes
me
a
quivering
silence
fell
from
the
blue
ceiling
of
the
large
room
the
spirit
lamp
had
just
gone
out
and
from
the
kettle
came
a
finer
and
finer
thread
of
steam
albine
and
serge
their
heads
side
by
side
upon
the
pillow
gazed
at
the
large
calico
curtains
drawn
across
the
windows
serge
s
eyes
especially
were
attracted
to
them
as
to
the
very
source
of
light
in
which
he
sought
to
steep
himself
as
in
diluted
sunshine
fitted
to
his
weakness
he
could
tell
that
the
sun
lay
behind
that
yellower
gleam
upon
one
corner
of
the
curtain
and
that
sufficed
to
make
him
feel
himself
again
meanwhile
a
rustle
of
leaves
came
upon
his
listening
ear
and
against
the
window
the
greenish
shadow
of
a
lofty
bough
brought
him
disturbing
thoughts
of
the
forest
which
he
could
feel
to
be
near
him
would
you
like
me
to
open
the
curtains
asked
albine
misunderstanding
his
steady
gaze
no
no
he
hastily
replied
it
s
a
fine
day
you
would
see
the
sunlight
and
the
no
please
don
t
i
don
t
want
to
see
anything
outside
that
bough
there
tires
me
with
its
waving
and
its
rising
as
if
it
was
alive
leave
your
hand
here
i
will
go
to
sleep
all
is
white
now
it
s
so
and
then
he
calmly
fell
asleep
while
albine
watched
beside
him
and
breathed
upon
his
face
to
make
his
slumber
cool
ii
the
fine
weather
broke
up
on
the
morrow
and
it
rained
heavily
serge
s
fever
returned
and
he
spent
a
day
of
suffering
with
his
eyes
despairingly
fixed
upon
the
curtains
through
which
the
light
now
fell
dim
and
ashy
grey
as
in
a
cellar
he
could
no
longer
see
a
trace
of
sunshine
and
he
looked
in
vain
for
the
shadow
that
had
scared
him
the
shadow
of
that
lofty
bough
which
had
disappeared
amid
the
mist
and
the
pouring
rain
and
seemed
to
have
carried
away
with
it
the
whole
forest
towards
evening
he
became
slightly
delirious
and
cried
out
to
albine
that
the
sun
was
dead
that
he
could
hear
all
the
sky
all
the
country
bewailing
the
death
of
the
sun
she
had
to
soothe
him
like
a
child
promising
him
the
sun
telling
him
that
it
would
come
back
again
that
she
would
give
it
to
him
but
he
also
grieved
for
the
plants
the
seeds
he
said
must
be
suffering
underground
waiting
for
the
return
of
light
they
had
nightmares
they
also
dreamed
that
they
were
crawling
along
an
underground
passage
hindered
by
mounds
of
ruins
struggling
madly
to
reach
the
sunshine
and
he
began
to
weep
and
sob
out
in
low
tones
that
winter
was
a
disease
of
the
earth
and
that
he
should
die
with
the
earth
unless
the
springtide
healed
them
both
for
three
days
more
the
weather
was
truly
frightful
the
downpour
burst
over
the
trees
with
the
awful
clamour
of
an
overflowing
river
gusts
of
wind
rolled
by
and
beat
against
the
windows
with
the
violence
of
enormous
waves
serge
had
insisted
on
albine
closing
the
shutters
by
lamplight
he
was
no
longer
troubled
by
the
gloom
of
the
pallid
curtains
he
no
longer
felt
the
greyness
of
the
sky
glide
in
through
the
smallest
chinks
and
flow
up
to
him
like
a
cloud
of
dust
intent
on
burying
him
however
increasing
apathy
crept
upon
him
as
he
lay
there
with
shrunken
arms
and
pallid
features
his
weakness
augmented
as
the
earth
grew
more
ailing
at
times
when
the
clouds
were
inky
black
when
the
bending
trees
cracked
and
the
grass
lay
limp
beneath
the
downpour
like
the
hair
of
a
drowned
woman
he
all
but
ceased
to
breathe
and
seemed
to
be
passing
away
shattered
by
the
hurricane
but
at
the
first
gleam
of
light
at
the
tiniest
speck
of
blue
between
two
clouds
he
breathed
once
more
and
drank
in
the
soothing
calm
of
the
drying
leaves
the
whitening
paths
the
fields
quaffing
their
last
draught
of
water
albine
now
also
longed
for
the
sun
twenty
times
a
day
would
she
go
to
the
window
on
the
landing
to
scan
the
sky
delighted
at
the
smallest
scrap
of
white
that
she
espied
but
perturbed
when
she
perceived
any
dusky
masses
and
ever
dreading
lest
some
sable
cloud
should
kill
her
dear
patient
she
talked
of
sending
for
doctor
pascal
but
serge
would
not
have
it
there
will
be
sunlight
on
the
curtains
he
said
and
then
i
shall
be
well
one
evening
when
his
condition
was
most
alarming
albine
again
gave
him
her
hand
to
rest
his
cheek
upon
but
when
she
saw
that
it
brought
him
no
relief
she
wept
to
find
herself
powerless
since
he
had
fallen
into
the
lethargy
of
winter
she
had
felt
too
weak
to
drag
him
unaided
from
the
nightmare
in
which
he
was
struggling
she
needed
the
assistance
of
spring
she
herself
was
fading
away
her
arms
grew
cold
her
breath
scant
she
no
longer
knew
how
to
breathe
life
into
him
for
hours
together
she
would
roam
about
the
spacious
dismal
room
and
as
she
passed
before
the
mirror
and
saw
herself
darkening
in
it
she
thought
she
had
become
hideous
one
morning
however
as
she
raised
his
pillows
not
daring
to
try
again
the
broken
spell
of
her
hands
she
fancied
that
she
once
more
caught
the
first
day
s
smile
on
serge
s
lips
open
the
shutters
he
said
faintly
she
thought
him
still
delirious
for
only
an
hour
previously
she
had
seen
but
a
gloomy
sky
on
looking
out
from
the
landing
hush
go
to
sleep
she
answered
sadly
i
have
promised
to
wake
you
at
the
very
first
ray
sleep
on
there
s
no
sun
out
yes
i
can
feel
it
its
light
is
there
open
the
iii
and
there
indeed
the
sunlight
was
when
albine
had
opened
the
shutters
behind
the
large
curtains
the
genial
yellow
glow
once
more
warmed
a
patch
of
the
white
calico
but
that
which
impelled
serge
to
sit
up
in
bed
was
the
sight
of
the
shadowy
bough
the
branch
that
for
him
heralded
the
return
of
life
all
the
resuscitated
earth
with
its
wealth
of
greenery
its
waters
and
its
belts
of
hills
was
in
that
greenish
blur
that
quivered
with
the
faintest
breath
of
air
it
no
longer
disturbed
him
he
greedily
watched
it
rocking
and
hungered
for
the
fortified
powers
of
the
vivifying
sap
which
to
him
it
symbolised
albine
happy
once
more
exclaimed
as
she
supported
him
in
her
arms
ah
my
dear
serge
the
winter
is
over
now
we
are
he
lay
down
again
his
eyes
already
brighter
and
his
voice
clearer
i
shall
be
very
strong
he
said
you
shall
draw
back
the
curtains
i
want
to
see
but
on
the
morrow
he
was
seized
with
childish
fear
he
would
not
hear
of
the
windows
being
opened
wide
he
muttered
later
he
was
fearful
he
dreaded
the
first
beam
of
light
that
would
flash
upon
his
eyes
evening
came
on
and
still
he
had
been
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
to
look
upon
the
sun
he
remained
thus
all
day
long
his
face
turned
towards
the
curtains
watching
on
their
transparent
tissue
the
pallor
of
morn
the
glow
of
noon
the
violet
tint
of
twilight
all
the
hues
all
the
emotions
of
the
sky
there
were
pictured
even
the
quiverings
of
the
warm
air
at
the
light
stroke
of
a
bird
s
wing
even
the
delight
of
earth
s
odours
throbbing
in
a
sunbeam
behind
that
veil
behind
that
softened
phantasm
of
the
mighty
life
without
he
could
hear
the
rise
of
spring
he
even
felt
stifled
at
times
when
in
spite
of
the
curtains
barrier
the
rush
of
the
earth
s
new
blood
came
upon
him
too
strongly
the
following
morning
he
was
still
asleep
when
albine
to
hasten
his
recovery
cried
out
to
him
serge
serge
here
s
the
sun
she
swiftly
drew
back
the
curtains
and
threw
the
windows
wide
open
he
raised
himself
and
knelt
upon
his
bed
oppressed
swooning
his
hands
tightly
pressed
against
his
breast
to
keep
his
heart
from
breaking
before
him
stretched
the
broad
sky
all
blue
a
boundless
blue
and
in
it
he
washed
away
his
sufferings
surrendering
himself
to
it
and
drinking
from
it
sweetness
and
purity
and
youth
the
bough
whose
shadow
he
had
noted
jutted
across
the
window
and
alone
set
against
the
azure
sea
its
vigorous
growth
of
green
but
even
this
was
too
much
for
his
sickly
fastidiousness
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
very
swallows
flying
past
besmeared
the
purity
of
the
azure
he
was
being
born
anew
he
raised
little
involuntary
cries
as
he
felt
himself
flooded
with
light
assailed
by
waves
of
warm
air
while
a
whirling
whelming
torrent
of
life
flowed
within
him
as
last
with
outstretched
hands
he
sank
back
upon
his
pillow
in
a
swoon
of
joy
what
a
happy
delicious
day
that
was
the
sun
came
in
from
the
right
far
away
from
the
alcove
throughout
the
morning
serge
watched
it
creeping
onward
he
could
see
it
coming
towards
him
yellow
as
gold
perching
here
and
there
on
the
old
furniture
frolicking
in
corners
at
times
gliding
along
the
ground
like
a
strip
of
ribbon
it
was
a
slow
deliberate
march
the
approach
of
a
fond
mistress
stretching
her
golden
limbs
drawing
nigh
to
the
alcove
with
rhythmic
motion
with
voluptuous
lingering
which
roused
intense
desire
at
length
towards
two
o
clock
the
sheet
of
sunlight
left
the
last
armchair
climbed
along
the
coverlet
and
spread
over
the
bed
like
loosened
locks
of
hair
to
its
glowing
fondling
serge
surrendered
his
wasted
hands
with
his
eyes
he
could
feel
fiery
kisses
thrilling
each
of
his
fingers
he
lay
in
a
bath
of
light
in
the
embrace
of
a
glowing
orb
and
when
albine
leaned
over
smiling
let
me
be
he
stammered
his
eyes
now
shut
don
t
hold
me
so
tightly
how
do
you
manage
to
hold
me
like
this
in
your
arms
but
the
sun
crept
down
the
bed
again
and
slowly
retreated
to
the
left
and
as
serge
watched
it
bend
once
more
and
settle
on
chair
after
chair
he
bitterly
regretted
that
he
had
not
kept
it
to
his
breast
albine
still
sat
upon
the
side
of
the
bed
and
the
pair
of
them
an
arm
round
each
other
s
neck
watched
the
slow
paling
of
the
sky
at
times
a
mighty
thrill
seemed
to
make
it
blanch
serge
s
languid
eyes
now
wandered
over
it
more
freely
and
detected
in
it
exquisite
tints
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
it
was
not
all
blue
but
rosy
blue
lilac
blue
tawny
blue
living
flesh
vast
and
spotless
nudity
heaving
like
a
woman
s
bosom
in
the
breeze
at
every
glance
into
space
he
found
a
fresh
surprise
unknown
nooks
coy
smiles
bewitching
rounded
outlines
gauzy
veils
which
were
cast
over
the
mighty
glorious
forms
of
goddesses
in
the
depths
of
peeping
paradises
and
with
his
limbs
lightened
by
suffering
he
winged
his
way
amid
that
shimmering
silk
that
stainless
down
of
azure
the
sun
sank
lower
and
lower
the
blue
melted
into
purest
gold
the
sky
s
living
flesh
gleamed
fairer
still
and
then
was
slowly
steeped
in
all
the
hues
of
gloom
not
a
cloud
nought
but
gradual
disappearance
a
disrobing
which
left
behind
it
but
a
gleam
of
modesty
on
the
horizon
and
at
last
the
broad
sky
slumbered
oh
the
dear
baby
exclaimed
albine
as
she
looked
at
serge
who
had
fallen
asleep
upon
her
neck
at
the
same
time
as
the
heavens
she
laid
him
down
in
bed
and
shut
the
windows
next
morning
however
they
were
opened
at
break
of
day
serge
could
no
longer
live
without
the
sunlight
his
strength
was
growing
he
was
becoming
accustomed
to
the
gusts
of
air
which
sent
the
alcove
curtains
flying
even
the
azure
the
everlasting
azure
began
to
pall
upon
him
he
grew
weary
of
being
white
and
swanlike
of
ever
swimming
on
heaven
s
limpid
lake
he
came
to
wish
for
a
pack
of
black
clouds
some
crumbling
of
the
skies
that
would
break
upon
the
monotony
of
all
that
purity
and
as
his
health
returned
he
hungered
for
keener
sensations
he
now
spent
hours
in
gazing
at
the
verdant
bough
he
would
have
liked
to
see
it
grow
expand
and
throw
out
its
branches
to
his
very
bed
it
no
longer
satisfied
him
but
only
roused
desires
speaking
to
him
as
it
did
of
all
the
trees
whose
call
he
could
hear
although
their
crests
were
hidden
from
his
sight
an
endless
whispering
of
leaves
a
chattering
as
of
running
water
a
fluttering
as
of
wings
all
blended
in
one
mighty
quivering
voice
resounded
in
his
ears
when
you
are
able
to
get
up
said
albine
you
shall
sit
at
the
window
you
will
see
the
lovely
garden
he
closed
his
eyes
and
murmured
gently
oh
i
can
see
it
i
hear
it
i
know
where
the
trees
are
where
the
water
runs
where
the
violets
and
then
he
added
but
i
can
t
see
it
clearly
i
see
it
without
any
light
i
must
be
very
strong
before
i
shall
be
able
to
get
as
far
as
the
at
times
when
albine
thought
him
asleep
she
would
vanish
for
hours
and
on
coming
in
again
she
would
find
him
burning
with
impatience
his
eyes
gleaming
with
curiosity
where
have
you
been
he
would
call
to
her
taking
hold
of
her
arms
and
feeling
her
skirts
her
bodice
and
her
cheeks
you
smell
of
all
sorts
of
nice
things
ah
you
have
been
walking
on
the
grass
at
this
she
would
laugh
and
show
him
her
shoes
wet
with
dew
you
have
been
in
the
garden
you
have
been
in
the
garden
he
then
exclaimed
delightedly
i
knew
it
when
you
came
in
you
seemed
like
a
large
flower
you
have
brought
the
whole
garden
in
your
he
would
keep
her
by
him
inhaling
her
like
a
nosegay
sometimes
she
came
back
with
briars
leaves
or
bits
of
wood
entangled
in
her
clothes
these
he
would
remove
and
hide
under
his
pillow
like
relics
one
day
she
brought
him
a
bunch
of
roses
at
the
sight
of
them
he
was
so
affected
that
he
wept
he
kissed
them
and
went
to
sleep
with
them
in
his
arms
but
when
they
faded
he
felt
so
keenly
grieved
that
he
forbade
albine
to
gather
any
more
he
preferred
her
said
he
for
she
was
as
fresh
and
as
balmy
and
she
never
faded
her
hands
her
hair
her
cheeks
were
always
fragrant
at
last
he
himself
would
send
her
into
the
garden
telling
her
not
to
come
back
before
an
hour
in
that
way
he
said
i
shall
get
sunlight
fresh
air
and
roses
till
often
when
he
saw
her
coming
in
out
of
breath
he
would
her
which
path
had
she
taken
had
she
wandered
among
the
trees
or
had
she
gone
round
the
meadow
side
had
she
seen
any
nests
had
she
sat
down
behind
a
bush
of
sweetbriar
or
under
an
oak
or
in
the
shade
of
a
clump
of
poplars
but
when
she
answered
him
and
tried
to
describe
the
garden
to
him
he
would
put
his
hand
to
her
lips
no
no
he
said
gently
it
is
wrong
of
me
i
don
t
want
to
know
i
would
rather
see
it
then
he
would
relapse
into
his
favourite
dream
of
all
the
greenery
which
he
could
feel
only
a
step
away
for
several
days
he
lived
on
that
dream
alone
at
first
he
said
he
had
perceived
the
garden
much
more
distinctly
as
he
gained
strength
the
surging
blood
that
warmed
his
veins
seemed
to
blur
his
dreamy
imaginings
his
uncertainties
multiplied
he
could
no
longer
tell
whether
the
trees
were
on
the
right
whether
the
water
flowed
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
or
whether
some
great
rocks
were
not
piled
below
his
windows
he
talked
softly
of
all
this
to
himself
on
the
slightest
indication
he
would
rear
wondrous
plans
which
the
song
of
a
bird
the
creaking
of
a
bough
the
scent
of
a
flower
would
suddenly
make
him
modify
impelling
him
to
plant
a
thicket
of
lilac
in
one
spot
and
in
another
to
place
where
formerly
there
had
been
a
lawn
every
hour
he
designed
some
new
garden
much
to
the
amusement
of
albine
who
whenever
she
surprised
him
at
it
would
exclaim
with
a
burst
of
laughter
that
s
not
it
i
assure
you
you
can
t
have
any
idea
of
it
it
s
more
beautiful
than
all
the
beautiful
things
you
ever
saw
so
don
t
go
racking
your
head
about
it
the
garden
s
mine
and
i
will
give
it
to
you
be
easy
it
won
t
run
serge
who
had
already
been
so
afraid
of
the
light
felt
considerable
trepidation
when
he
found
himself
strong
enough
to
go
and
rest
his
elbows
on
the
every
evening
he
once
more
repeated
and
he
would
turn
away
in
his
bed
with
a
shudder
when
albine
came
in
and
would
cry
out
that
she
smelt
of
hawthorn
that
she
had
scratched
her
hands
in
burrowing
a
hole
through
a
hedge
to
bring
him
all
its
odour
one
morning
however
she
suddenly
took
him
up
in
her
arms
and
almost
carrying
him
to
the
window
held
him
there
and
forced
him
to
look
out
and
see
what
a
coward
you
are
she
exclaimed
with
her
fine
ringing
laugh
and
waving
one
hand
all
round
the
landscape
she
repeated
with
an
air
of
triumph
full
of
tender
promise
the
paradou
the
paradou
serge
looked
out
upon
it
speechless
iv
a
sea
of
verdure
in
front
to
right
to
left
everywhere
a
sea
rolling
its
surging
billows
of
leaves
as
far
as
the
horizon
unhindered
by
house
or
screen
of
wall
or
dusty
road
a
desert
virgin
hallowed
sea
displaying
its
wild
sweetness
in
the
innocence
of
solitude
the
sun
alone
came
thither
weltering
in
the
meadows
in
a
sheet
of
gold
threading
the
paths
with
the
frolicsome
scamper
of
its
beams
letting
its
flaming
locks
droop
through
the
trees
sipping
from
the
springs
with
amber
lips
that
thrilled
the
water
beneath
that
flaming
dust
the
vast
garden
ran
riot
like
some
delighted
beast
let
loose
at
the
world
s
very
end
far
from
everything
and
free
from
everything
so
prodigal
was
the
luxuriance
of
foliage
so
overflowing
the
tide
of
herbage
that
from
end
to
end
it
all
seemed
hidden
flooded
submerged
nought
could
be
seen
but
slopes
of
green
stems
springing
up
like
fountains
billowy
masses
woodland
curtains
closely
drawn
mantles
of
creepers
trailing
over
the
ground
and
flights
of
giant
boughs
swooping
down
upon
every
side
amidst
that
tremendous
luxuriance
of
vegetation
even
lengthy
scrutiny
could
barely
make
out
the
bygone
plan
of
the
paradou
in
the
foreground
in
a
sort
of
immense
amphitheatre
must
have
lain
the
flower
garden
whose
fountains
were
now
sunken
and
dry
its
stone
balustrades
shattered
its
flight
of
steps
all
warped
and
its
statues
overthrown
patches
of
their
whiteness
gleaming
amidst
the
dusky
stretches
of
turf
farther
back
behind
the
blue
line
of
a
sheet
of
water
stretched
a
maze
of
farther
still
rose
towering
woodland
its
dusky
violet
depths
streaked
with
bands
of
light
it
was
a
forest
which
had
regained
virginity
an
endless
stretch
of
rising
one
above
the
other
tinged
with
yellowish
green
and
pale
green
and
vivid
green
according
to
the
variety
of
the
species
on
the
right
the
forest
scaled
some
hills
dotting
them
with
little
clumps
of
and
dying
away
in
straggling
brushwood
while
a
huge
barrier
of
barren
rock
heaped
together
like
the
fallen
wreckage
of
a
mountain
shut
out
all
view
beyond
flaming
growths
there
cleaved
the
rugged
soil
monstrous
plants
lay
motionless
in
the
heat
like
drowsing
reptiles
a
silvery
streak
a
foamy
splash
that
glistened
in
the
distance
like
a
cloud
of
pearls
revealed
the
presence
of
a
waterfall
the
source
of
those
tranquil
streams
that
lazily
skirted
the
lastly
on
the
left
the
river
flowed
through
a
vast
stretch
of
meadowland
where
it
parted
into
four
streamlets
which
winded
fitfully
beneath
the
rushes
between
the
willows
behind
the
taller
trees
and
far
away
into
the
distance
grassy
patches
prolonged
the
lowland
freshness
forming
a
landscape
steeped
in
bluish
haze
where
a
gleam
of
daylight
slowly
melted
into
the
verdant
blue
of
sunset
the
paradou
its
forest
rocks
streams
and
meadows
filled
the
whole
breadth
of
sky
the
paradou
stammered
serge
stretching
out
his
arms
as
if
to
clasp
the
entire
garden
to
his
breast
he
tottered
and
albine
had
to
seat
him
in
an
armchair
there
he
sat
for
two
whole
hours
intently
gazing
without
opening
his
lips
his
chin
resting
on
his
hands
at
times
his
eyelids
fluttered
and
a
flush
rose
to
his
cheeks
slowly
he
looked
profoundly
amazed
it
was
all
too
vast
too
complex
too
overpowering
i
can
not
see
i
can
not
understand
he
cried
stretching
out
his
hands
to
albine
with
a
gesture
of
uttermost
weariness
the
girl
came
and
leant
over
the
back
of
his
armchair
taking
his
head
between
her
hands
she
compelled
him
to
look
again
and
softly
said
it
s
all
our
own
nobody
will
ever
come
in
when
you
are
well
again
we
will
go
for
walks
there
we
shall
have
room
enough
for
walking
all
our
lives
we
ll
go
wherever
you
like
where
would
you
like
to
go
he
smiled
oh
not
far
he
murmured
the
first
day
only
two
steps
or
so
beyond
the
door
i
should
surely
fall
see
i
ll
go
over
there
under
that
tree
close
to
the
but
she
resumed
would
you
like
to
go
into
the
the
parterre
you
shall
see
the
roses
they
have
everything
even
the
old
paths
are
all
covered
with
them
or
would
you
like
the
orchard
better
i
can
only
crawl
into
it
on
my
hands
and
knees
the
boughs
are
so
bowed
down
with
fruit
but
we
ll
go
even
farther
if
you
feel
strong
enough
we
ll
go
as
far
as
the
forest
right
into
the
depths
of
shade
far
far
away
so
far
that
we
ll
sleep
out
there
when
night
steals
over
us
or
else
some
morning
we
can
climb
up
yonder
to
the
summit
of
those
rocks
you
ll
see
the
plants
which
make
me
quake
you
ll
see
the
springs
such
a
shower
of
water
what
fun
it
will
be
to
feel
the
spray
all
over
our
faces
but
if
you
prefer
to
walk
along
the
hedges
beside
a
brook
we
must
go
round
by
the
meadows
it
is
so
nice
under
the
willows
in
the
evening
at
sunset
one
can
lie
down
on
the
grass
and
watch
the
little
green
frogs
hopping
about
on
the
no
no
said
serge
you
weary
me
i
don
t
want
to
go
so
far
i
will
only
go
a
couple
of
steps
that
will
be
more
than
even
i
she
still
continued
even
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
go
everywhere
there
are
many
nooks
i
don
t
know
i
have
walked
and
walked
in
it
for
years
and
still
i
feel
sure
there
are
unknown
spots
around
places
where
the
shade
must
be
cooler
and
the
turf
softer
listen
i
have
always
fancied
there
must
be
one
especially
in
which
i
should
like
to
live
for
ever
i
know
it
s
somewhere
i
must
have
passed
it
by
or
perhaps
it
s
hidden
so
far
away
that
i
have
never
even
got
as
far
with
all
my
rambles
but
we
ll
look
for
it
together
serge
won
t
we
and
live
no
no
be
quiet
stammered
the
young
man
i
don
t
understand
what
you
are
saying
you
re
killing
for
a
moment
she
let
him
sob
in
her
arms
it
troubled
and
grieved
her
that
she
could
find
no
words
to
soothe
him
isn
t
the
paradou
as
beautiful
then
as
you
fancied
it
she
asked
at
last
he
raised
his
face
and
answered
i
don
t
know
it
was
quite
little
and
now
it
is
ever
growing
bigger
and
bigger
take
me
away
hide
she
led
him
back
to
bed
soothing
him
like
a
child
lulling
him
with
a
fib
there
there
it
s
not
true
there
is
no
garden
it
was
only
a
story
that
i
told
you
go
sleep
in
v
every
day
in
this
wise
she
made
him
sit
at
the
window
during
the
cool
hours
of
morning
he
would
now
attempt
to
take
a
few
steps
leaning
the
while
on
the
furniture
a
rosy
tint
appeared
upon
his
cheeks
and
his
hands
began
to
lose
their
waxy
transparency
but
while
he
thus
regained
health
his
senses
remained
in
a
state
of
stupor
which
reduced
him
to
the
vegetative
life
of
some
poor
creature
born
only
the
day
before
indeed
he
was
nothing
but
a
plant
his
sole
perception
was
that
of
the
air
which
floated
round
him
he
lacked
the
blood
necessary
for
the
efforts
of
life
and
remained
as
it
were
clinging
to
the
soil
imbibing
all
the
sap
he
could
it
was
like
a
slow
hatching
in
the
warm
egg
of
springtide
albine
remembering
certain
remarks
of
doctor
pascal
felt
terrified
at
seeing
him
remain
in
this
state
innocent
like
a
little
boy
she
had
heard
it
said
that
certain
maladies
left
insanity
behind
them
and
she
spent
hours
in
gazing
at
him
and
trying
her
utmost
as
mothers
do
to
make
him
smile
but
as
yet
he
had
not
laughed
when
she
passed
her
hand
across
his
eyes
he
never
saw
he
never
followed
the
shadow
even
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
barely
turned
his
head
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
came
she
had
but
one
consolation
he
thrived
splendidly
he
was
quite
a
handsome
child
for
another
whole
week
she
lavished
the
tenderest
care
on
him
she
patiently
waited
for
him
to
grow
and
as
she
marked
various
symptoms
of
awakening
perception
her
fears
subsided
and
she
began
to
think
that
time
might
make
a
man
of
him
when
she
touched
him
now
he
started
slightly
another
time
one
night
he
broke
into
a
feeble
laugh
on
the
morrow
when
she
had
seated
him
at
the
window
she
went
down
into
the
garden
and
ran
about
in
it
calling
to
him
the
while
she
vanished
under
the
trees
flitted
across
the
sunny
patches
and
came
back
breathless
and
clapping
her
hands
at
first
his
wavering
eyes
failed
to
perceive
her
but
as
she
started
off
again
perpetually
playing
at
reappearing
behind
every
other
bush
he
was
at
last
able
to
follow
the
white
gleam
of
her
skirt
and
when
she
suddenly
came
forward
and
stood
with
upraised
face
below
his
window
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
seemed
anxious
to
go
down
to
her
but
she
came
upstairs
again
and
embraced
him
proudly
ah
you
saw
me
you
saw
me
she
cried
you
would
like
to
come
into
the
garden
with
me
would
you
not
if
you
only
knew
how
wretched
you
have
made
me
these
last
few
days
with
your
stupid
ways
never
seeing
me
or
hearing
me
he
listened
to
her
but
apparently
with
some
slight
sensation
of
pain
that
made
him
bend
his
neck
in
a
shrinking
way
you
are
better
now
however
she
went
on
well
enough
to
come
down
whenever
you
like
why
don
t
you
say
anything
have
you
lost
your
tongue
oh
what
a
baby
why
i
shall
have
to
teach
him
how
to
talk
and
thereupon
she
really
did
amuse
herself
by
telling
him
the
names
of
the
things
he
touched
he
could
only
stammer
reiterating
the
syllables
and
failing
to
utter
a
single
word
plainly
however
she
began
to
walk
him
about
the
room
holding
him
up
and
leading
him
from
the
bed
to
the
window
quite
a
long
journey
two
or
three
times
he
almost
fell
on
the
way
at
which
she
laughed
one
day
he
fairly
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
she
had
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
to
get
him
up
on
his
feet
again
then
she
made
him
undertake
the
round
of
the
room
letting
him
rest
by
the
way
on
the
sofa
and
the
chairs
a
tour
round
a
little
world
which
took
up
a
good
hour
at
last
he
was
able
to
venture
on
a
few
steps
alone
she
would
stand
before
him
with
outstretched
hands
and
move
backwards
calling
him
so
that
he
should
cross
the
room
in
search
of
her
supporting
arms
if
he
sulked
and
refused
to
walk
she
would
take
the
comb
from
her
hair
and
hold
it
out
to
him
like
a
toy
then
he
would
come
to
her
and
sit
still
in
a
corner
for
hours
playing
with
her
comb
and
gently
scratching
his
hands
with
its
teeth
at
last
one
morning
she
found
him
up
he
had
already
succeeded
in
opening
one
of
the
shutters
and
was
attempting
to
walk
about
without
leaning
on
the
furniture
good
gracious
we
are
active
this
morning
she
exclaimed
gleefully
why
he
will
be
jumping
out
of
the
window
if
he
has
his
own
way
so
you
are
quite
strong
now
eh
serge
s
answer
was
a
childish
laugh
his
limbs
were
regaining
the
strength
of
adolescence
but
more
perceptive
sensations
remained
unroused
he
spent
whole
afternoons
in
gazing
out
on
the
paradou
pouting
like
a
child
that
sees
nought
but
whiteness
and
hears
but
the
vibration
of
sounds
he
still
retained
the
ignorance
of
urchinhood
his
sense
of
touch
as
yet
so
innocent
that
he
failed
to
tell
albine
s
gown
from
the
covers
of
the
old
armchairs
his
eyes
still
stared
wonderingly
his
movements
still
displayed
the
wavering
hesitation
of
limbs
which
scarce
knew
how
to
reach
their
goal
his
state
was
one
of
incipient
purely
instinctive
existence
into
which
entered
no
knowledge
of
surroundings
the
man
was
not
yet
born
within
him
that
s
right
you
ll
act
the
silly
will
you
muttered
albine
we
ll
she
took
off
her
comb
and
held
it
out
to
him
will
you
have
my
comb
she
said
come
and
fetch
when
she
had
got
him
out
of
the
room
by
retreating
before
him
all
the
way
she
put
her
arm
round
his
waist
and
helped
him
down
each
stair
amusing
him
while
she
put
her
comb
back
even
tickling
his
neck
with
a
lock
of
her
hair
so
that
he
remained
unaware
that
he
was
going
downstairs
but
when
he
was
in
the
hall
he
became
frightened
at
the
darkness
of
the
passage
just
look
she
cried
throwing
the
door
wide
open
it
was
like
a
sudden
dawn
a
curtain
of
shadow
snatched
aside
revealing
the
joyousness
of
early
day
the
park
spread
out
before
them
verdantly
limpid
freshly
cool
and
deep
as
a
spring
serge
entranced
lingered
upon
the
threshold
with
a
hesitating
desire
to
feel
that
luminous
lake
with
his
foot
one
would
think
you
were
afraid
of
wetting
yourself
said
albine
don
t
be
frightened
the
ground
is
safe
he
had
ventured
to
take
one
step
and
was
astonished
at
encountering
the
soft
resistance
of
the
gravel
the
first
touch
of
the
soil
gave
him
a
shock
life
seemed
to
rebound
within
him
and
to
set
him
for
a
moment
erect
with
expanding
frame
while
he
drew
long
breaths
come
now
be
brave
insisted
albine
you
know
you
promised
me
to
take
five
steps
we
ll
go
as
far
as
the
mulberry
tree
there
under
the
window
there
you
can
it
took
him
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
make
those
five
steps
after
each
effort
he
stopped
as
if
he
had
been
obliged
to
tear
up
roots
that
held
him
to
the
ground
the
girl
pushing
him
along
said
with
a
laugh
you
look
just
like
a
walking
having
placed
him
with
his
back
leaning
against
the
mulberry
tree
in
the
rain
of
sunlight
falling
from
its
boughs
she
bounded
off
and
left
him
calling
out
to
him
that
he
must
not
stir
serge
standing
there
with
drooping
hands
slowly
turned
his
head
towards
the
park
terrestrial
childhood
met
his
gaze
the
pale
greenery
was
steeped
in
the
very
milk
of
youth
flooded
with
golden
brightness
the
trees
were
still
in
infancy
the
flowers
were
as
as
babes
the
streams
were
blue
with
the
artless
blue
of
lovely
infantile
eyes
beneath
every
leaf
was
some
token
of
a
delightful
awakening
serge
had
fixed
his
eyes
upon
a
yellow
breach
which
a
wide
path
made
in
front
of
him
amidst
a
dense
mass
of
foliage
at
the
very
end
eastward
some
meadows
steeped
in
gold
looked
like
the
luminous
field
upon
which
the
sun
would
descend
and
he
waited
for
the
morn
to
take
that
path
and
flow
towards
him
he
could
feel
it
coming
in
a
warm
breeze
so
faint
at
first
that
it
barely
brushed
across
his
skin
but
rising
little
by
little
and
growing
ever
brisker
till
he
was
thrilled
all
over
he
could
also
taste
it
coming
with
a
more
and
more
pronounced
savour
bringing
the
healthful
acridity
of
the
open
air
holding
to
his
lips
a
feast
of
sugary
aromatics
sour
fruits
and
milky
shoots
further
he
could
smell
it
coming
with
the
perfumes
which
it
culled
upon
its
way
the
scent
of
earth
the
scent
of
the
shady
woods
the
scent
of
the
warm
plants
the
scent
of
living
animals
a
whole
posy
of
scents
powerful
enough
to
bring
on
dizziness
he
could
likewise
hear
it
coming
with
the
rapid
flight
of
a
bird
skimming
over
the
grass
waking
the
whole
garden
from
silence
giving
voice
to
all
it
touched
and
filling
his
ears
with
the
music
of
things
and
beings
finally
he
could
see
it
coming
from
the
end
of
the
path
from
the
meadows
steeped
in
gold
yes
he
could
see
that
rosy
air
so
bright
that
it
lighted
the
way
it
took
with
a
gleaming
smile
no
bigger
in
the
distance
than
a
spot
of
daylight
but
in
a
few
swift
bounds
transformed
into
the
very
splendour
of
the
sun
and
the
morn
flowed
up
and
beat
against
the
mulberry
tree
against
which
serge
was
leaning
and
he
himself
resuscitated
amidst
the
childhood
of
the
morn
serge
serge
cried
albine
lost
to
sight
behind
the
high
shrubs
of
the
flower
garden
don
t
be
afraid
i
am
but
serge
no
longer
felt
frightened
he
was
being
born
anew
in
the
sunshine
in
that
pure
bath
of
light
which
streamed
upon
him
he
was
being
born
anew
at
his
senses
hurriedly
unclosing
enraptured
with
the
mighty
sky
the
joyful
earth
the
prodigy
of
loveliness
spread
out
around
him
this
garden
which
he
knew
not
only
the
day
before
now
afforded
him
boundless
delight
everything
filled
him
with
ecstasy
even
the
blades
of
grass
the
pebbles
in
the
paths
the
invisible
puffs
of
air
that
flitted
over
his
cheeks
his
whole
body
entered
into
possession
of
this
stretch
of
nature
he
embraced
it
with
his
limbs
he
drank
it
in
with
his
lips
he
inhaled
it
with
his
nostrils
he
carried
it
in
his
ears
and
hid
it
in
the
depths
of
his
eyes
it
was
his
own
the
roses
of
the
flower
garden
the
lofty
boughs
of
the
forest
the
resounding
rocks
of
the
waterfall
the
meadows
which
the
sun
planted
with
blades
of
light
were
his
then
he
closed
his
eyes
and
slowly
reopened
them
that
he
might
enjoy
the
dazzle
of
a
second
wakening
the
birds
have
eaten
all
the
strawberries
said
albine
disconsolately
as
she
ran
up
to
him
see
i
have
only
been
able
to
find
these
two
but
she
stopped
short
a
few
steps
away
and
gazing
at
serge
with
rapturous
astonishment
how
handsome
you
are
she
cried
she
drew
a
little
nearer
then
stood
there
absorbed
in
her
contemplation
and
murmuring
i
had
never
never
seen
you
he
had
certainly
grown
taller
clothed
in
a
loose
garment
he
stood
erect
still
somewhat
slender
with
finely
moulded
limbs
square
chest
and
rounded
shoulders
his
head
slightly
thrown
back
was
poised
upon
a
flexible
and
snowy
neck
rimmed
with
brown
behind
health
and
strength
and
power
were
on
his
face
he
did
not
smile
his
expression
was
that
of
repose
with
grave
and
tender
mouth
firm
cheeks
large
nose
and
grey
clear
commanding
eyes
the
long
locks
that
thickly
covered
his
head
fell
upon
his
shoulders
in
jetty
curls
while
a
slender
growth
of
hair
through
which
gleamed
his
white
skin
curled
upon
his
upper
lip
and
chin
oh
how
handsome
how
handsome
you
are
lingeringly
repeated
albine
crouching
at
his
feet
and
gazing
up
at
him
with
loving
eyes
but
why
are
you
sulking
with
me
why
don
t
you
speak
to
me
still
he
stood
there
and
made
no
answer
his
eyes
were
far
away
he
never
even
saw
that
child
at
his
feet
he
spoke
to
himself
in
the
sunlight
and
said
how
good
the
light
is
that
utterance
sounded
like
a
vibration
of
the
sunlight
itself
it
fell
amid
the
silence
in
the
faintest
of
whispers
like
a
musical
sigh
a
quiver
of
warmth
and
of
life
for
several
days
albine
had
never
heard
his
voice
and
now
like
himself
it
had
altered
it
seemed
to
her
to
course
through
the
park
more
sweetly
than
the
melody
of
birds
more
imperiously
than
the
wind
that
bends
the
boughs
it
reigned
it
ruled
the
whole
garden
heard
it
though
it
had
been
but
a
faint
and
passing
breath
and
the
whole
garden
was
thrilled
with
the
joyousness
it
brought
speak
to
me
implored
albine
you
have
never
spoken
to
me
like
that
when
you
were
upstairs
in
your
room
when
you
were
not
dumb
you
talked
the
silly
prattle
of
a
child
how
is
it
i
no
longer
know
your
voice
just
now
i
thought
it
had
come
down
from
the
trees
that
it
reached
me
from
every
part
of
the
garden
that
it
was
one
of
those
deep
sighs
that
used
to
worry
me
at
night
before
you
came
listen
everything
is
keeping
silence
to
hear
you
speak
but
still
he
failed
to
recognise
her
presence
tenderer
grew
her
tones
no
don
t
speak
if
it
tires
you
sit
down
beside
me
and
we
will
remain
here
on
the
grass
till
the
sun
wanes
and
look
i
have
found
two
strawberries
such
trouble
i
had
too
the
birds
eat
up
everything
one
s
for
you
both
if
you
like
or
we
can
halve
them
and
taste
each
of
them
you
ll
thank
me
and
then
i
shall
hear
but
he
would
not
sit
down
he
refused
the
strawberries
which
albine
pettishly
threw
away
she
did
not
open
her
lips
again
she
would
rather
have
seen
him
ill
as
in
those
earlier
days
when
she
had
given
him
her
hand
for
a
pillow
and
had
felt
him
coming
back
to
life
beneath
the
cooling
breath
she
blew
upon
his
face
she
cursed
the
returning
health
which
now
made
him
stand
in
the
light
like
a
young
unheeding
god
would
he
be
ever
thus
then
with
never
a
glance
for
her
would
he
never
be
further
healed
and
at
last
see
her
and
love
her
and
she
dreamed
of
once
again
being
his
healer
of
accomplishing
by
the
sole
power
of
her
little
hands
the
cure
of
the
second
childhood
in
which
he
remained
she
could
clearly
see
that
there
was
no
spark
in
the
depths
of
his
grey
eyes
that
his
was
but
a
pallid
beauty
like
that
of
the
statues
which
had
fallen
among
the
nettles
of
the
she
rose
and
clasped
him
breathing
on
his
neck
to
rouse
him
but
that
morning
serge
never
even
felt
the
breath
that
lifted
his
silky
beard
the
sun
got
low
it
was
time
to
go
indoors
on
reaching
his
room
albine
burst
into
tears
from
that
morning
forward
the
invalid
took
a
short
walk
in
the
garden
every
day
he
went
past
the
mulberry
tree
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
terrace
where
a
wide
flight
of
broken
steps
descended
to
the
flowery
parterre
he
grew
accustomed
to
the
open
air
each
bath
of
sunlight
brought
him
fresh
vigour
a
young
chestnut
tree
which
had
sprung
from
some
fallen
nut
between
two
stones
of
the
balustrade
burst
the
resin
of
its
buds
and
unfolded
its
leafy
fans
with
far
less
vigour
than
he
progressed
one
day
indeed
he
even
attempted
to
descend
the
steps
but
in
this
his
strength
failed
him
and
he
sat
down
among
the
which
had
grown
up
between
the
cracks
in
the
stone
flags
below
to
the
left
he
could
see
a
small
wood
of
roses
it
was
thither
that
he
dreamt
of
going
wait
a
little
longer
said
albine
the
scent
of
the
roses
is
too
strong
for
you
yet
i
have
never
been
able
to
sit
long
under
the
without
feeling
exhausted
with
a
longing
to
cry
don
t
be
afraid
i
will
some
day
lead
you
to
the
and
i
shall
surely
weep
among
them
for
you
make
me
very
vi
one
morning
she
at
last
succeeded
in
helping
him
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
trampling
down
the
grass
before
him
with
her
feet
and
clearing
a
way
for
him
through
the
briars
whose
supple
arms
barred
the
last
few
yards
then
they
slowly
entered
the
wood
of
roses
it
was
indeed
a
very
wood
with
thickets
of
tall
standard
roses
throwing
out
leafy
clumps
as
big
as
trees
and
enormous
rose
bushes
impenetrable
as
copses
of
young
oaks
here
formerly
there
had
been
a
most
marvellous
collection
of
plants
but
since
the
flower
garden
had
been
left
in
abandonment
everything
had
run
wild
and
a
virgin
forest
had
arisen
a
forest
of
roses
the
paths
crowded
with
wild
offshoots
so
mingled
so
blended
that
roses
of
every
scent
and
hue
seemed
to
blossom
on
the
same
stem
creeping
roses
formed
mossy
carpets
on
the
ground
while
climbing
roses
clung
to
others
like
greedy
ivy
plants
and
ascended
in
spindles
of
verdure
letting
a
shower
of
their
loosened
petals
fall
at
the
lightest
breeze
natural
paths
coursed
through
the
wood
narrow
footways
broad
avenues
enchanting
covered
walks
in
which
one
strolled
in
the
shade
and
scent
these
led
to
glades
and
clearings
under
bowers
of
small
red
roses
and
between
walls
hung
with
tiny
yellow
ones
some
sunny
nooks
gleamed
like
green
silken
stuff
embroidered
with
bright
patterns
other
shadier
corners
offered
the
seclusion
of
alcoves
and
an
aroma
of
love
the
balmy
warmth
as
it
were
of
a
posy
languishing
on
a
woman
s
bosom
the
rose
bushes
had
whispering
voices
too
and
the
rose
bushes
were
full
of
songbirds
nests
we
must
take
care
not
to
lose
ourselves
said
albine
as
she
entered
the
wood
i
did
lose
myself
once
and
the
sun
had
set
before
i
was
able
to
free
myself
from
the
rose
bushes
which
caught
me
by
the
skirt
at
every
they
had
barely
walked
a
few
minutes
however
before
serge
worn
out
with
fatigue
wished
to
sit
down
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
ground
and
fell
into
deep
slumber
albine
sat
musing
by
his
side
they
were
on
the
edge
of
a
glade
near
a
narrow
path
which
stretched
away
through
the
wood
streaked
with
flashes
of
sunlight
and
through
a
small
round
blue
gap
at
its
far
end
revealed
the
sky
other
little
paths
led
from
the
clearing
into
leafy
recesses
the
glade
was
formed
of
tall
rose
bushes
rising
one
above
the
other
with
such
a
wealth
of
branches
such
a
tangle
of
thorny
shoots
that
big
patches
of
foliage
were
caught
aloft
and
hung
there
stretching
out
from
bush
to
bush
through
the
tiny
apertures
in
the
patches
of
leaves
which
were
suggestive
of
fine
lace
the
light
filtered
like
impalpable
sunny
dust
and
from
the
vaulted
roof
hung
stray
branches
chandeliers
as
it
were
thick
clusters
suspended
from
green
stems
armfuls
of
flowers
that
reached
to
the
ground
athwart
some
rent
in
the
leafy
ceiling
which
trailed
around
like
a
tattered
curtain
albine
meanwhile
was
gazing
at
serge
asleep
she
had
never
seen
him
so
utterly
prostrated
in
body
as
now
his
hands
lying
open
on
the
turf
his
face
deathly
so
dead
indeed
he
was
to
her
that
she
thought
she
could
kiss
his
face
without
his
even
feeling
it
and
sadly
absently
she
busied
her
hands
with
shredding
all
the
roses
within
her
reach
above
her
head
drooped
an
enormous
cluster
which
brushed
against
her
hair
set
roses
on
her
twisted
locks
her
ears
her
neck
and
even
threw
a
mantle
of
the
fragrant
flowers
across
her
shoulders
higher
up
under
her
fingers
other
roses
rained
down
with
large
and
tender
petals
exquisitely
formed
which
in
hue
suggested
the
faintly
flushing
purity
of
a
maiden
s
bosom
like
a
living
snowfall
these
roses
already
hid
her
feet
in
the
grass
and
they
climbed
her
knees
covered
her
skirt
and
smothered
her
to
her
waist
while
three
stray
petals
which
had
fluttered
on
to
her
bodice
just
above
her
bosom
there
looked
like
three
glimpses
of
her
bewitching
skin
oh
the
lazy
fellow
she
murmured
feeling
bored
and
picking
up
two
handfuls
of
roses
which
she
flung
in
serge
s
face
to
wake
him
he
did
not
stir
however
but
still
lay
there
with
the
roses
on
his
eyes
and
mouth
this
made
albine
laugh
she
stooped
down
and
with
her
whole
heart
kissed
both
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
blowing
as
she
kissed
to
drive
the
rose
petals
away
but
they
remained
upon
his
lips
and
she
broke
into
still
louder
laughter
intensely
amused
at
this
flowery
caressing
serge
slowly
raised
himself
he
gazed
at
her
with
amazement
as
if
startled
at
finding
her
there
who
are
you
where
do
you
come
from
what
are
you
doing
here
beside
me
he
asked
her
and
still
she
smiled
transported
with
delight
at
marking
this
awakening
of
his
senses
then
he
seemed
to
remember
something
and
continued
with
a
gesture
of
happy
confidence
i
know
you
are
my
love
flesh
of
my
flesh
you
are
waiting
for
me
that
we
may
be
one
for
ever
i
was
dreaming
of
you
you
were
in
my
breast
and
i
gave
you
my
blood
my
muscles
my
bones
i
felt
no
pain
you
took
half
my
heart
so
tenderly
that
i
experienced
keen
inward
delight
at
thus
dividing
myself
i
sought
all
that
was
best
and
most
beautiful
within
me
to
give
it
to
you
you
might
have
carried
off
everything
and
still
i
should
have
thanked
you
and
i
woke
when
you
went
out
of
me
you
left
through
my
eyes
and
mouth
ay
i
felt
it
you
were
all
warm
all
fragrant
so
sweet
that
it
was
the
thrill
from
you
that
has
made
me
albine
listened
to
his
words
with
ecstasy
at
last
he
saw
her
at
last
his
birth
was
accomplished
his
cure
begun
with
outstretched
hands
she
begged
him
to
go
on
how
have
i
managed
to
live
without
you
he
murmured
no
i
did
not
live
i
was
like
a
slumbering
animal
and
now
you
are
mine
and
you
are
no
one
but
myself
listen
you
must
never
leave
me
for
you
are
my
very
breath
and
in
leaving
me
you
would
rob
me
of
my
life
we
will
remain
within
ourselves
you
will
be
mine
even
as
i
shall
be
yours
should
i
ever
forsake
you
may
i
be
accursed
may
my
body
wither
like
a
useless
and
noxious
weed
he
caught
hold
of
her
hands
and
exclaimed
in
a
voice
quivering
with
admiration
how
beautiful
you
are
in
the
falling
dust
of
sunshine
albine
s
skin
looked
milky
white
scarce
gilded
here
and
there
by
the
sunny
sheen
the
shower
of
roses
around
and
on
her
steeped
her
in
pinkness
her
fair
hair
loosely
held
together
by
her
comb
decked
her
head
as
with
a
setting
planet
whose
last
bright
sparks
shone
upon
the
nape
of
her
neck
she
wore
a
white
gown
her
arms
her
throat
her
stainless
skin
bloomed
unabashed
as
a
flower
musky
with
a
goodly
fragrance
her
figure
was
slender
not
too
tall
but
supple
as
a
snake
s
with
softly
rounded
voluptuously
expanding
outlines
in
which
the
freshness
of
childhood
mingled
with
womanhood
s
nascent
charms
her
oval
face
with
its
narrow
brow
and
rather
full
mouth
beamed
with
the
tender
living
light
of
her
blue
eyes
and
yet
she
was
grave
too
her
cheeks
unruffled
her
chin
plump
as
naturally
lovely
as
are
the
trees
and
how
i
love
you
said
serge
drawing
her
to
himself
they
were
wholly
one
another
s
now
clasped
in
each
other
s
arms
they
did
not
kiss
but
held
each
other
round
the
waist
cheek
to
cheek
united
dumb
delighted
with
their
oneness
around
them
bloomed
the
roses
with
a
mad
amorous
blossoming
full
of
crimson
and
rosy
and
white
laughter
the
living
opening
flowers
seemed
to
bare
their
very
bosoms
yellow
roses
were
there
showing
the
golden
skin
of
barbarian
maidens
roses
roses
roses
every
shade
of
the
necks
which
are
ambered
by
glowing
skies
then
there
was
skin
of
softer
hue
among
the
tea
roses
bewitchingly
moist
and
cool
one
caught
glimpses
of
modest
bashful
charms
with
skin
as
fine
as
silk
tinged
faintly
with
a
blue
network
of
veins
farther
on
all
the
smiling
life
of
the
rose
expanded
there
was
the
blush
white
rose
barely
tinged
with
a
dash
of
carmine
snowy
as
the
foot
of
a
maid
dabbling
in
a
spring
there
was
the
silvery
pink
more
subdued
than
even
the
glow
with
which
a
youthful
arm
irradiates
a
wide
sleeve
there
was
the
clear
fresh
rose
in
which
blood
seemed
to
gleam
under
satin
as
in
the
bare
shoulders
of
a
woman
bathed
in
light
and
there
was
the
bright
pink
rose
with
its
buds
like
the
nipples
of
virgin
bosoms
and
its
opening
flowers
that
suggested
parted
lips
exhaling
warm
and
perfumed
breath
and
the
climbing
roses
the
tall
cluster
roses
with
their
showers
of
white
flowers
clothed
all
these
others
with
the
lacework
of
their
bunches
the
innocence
of
their
flimsy
muslin
while
here
and
there
roses
dark
as
the
lees
of
wine
sanguineous
almost
black
showed
amidst
the
bridal
purity
like
passion
s
wounds
verily
it
was
like
a
bridal
the
bridal
of
the
fragrant
wood
the
virginity
of
may
led
to
the
fertility
of
july
and
august
the
first
unknowing
kiss
culled
like
a
nosegay
on
the
wedding
morn
even
in
the
grass
moss
roses
clad
in
garments
of
green
wool
seemed
to
be
awaiting
the
advent
of
love
flowers
rambled
all
along
the
path
faces
peeped
out
everywhere
to
court
the
passing
breezes
bright
were
the
smiles
under
the
spreading
tent
of
the
glade
not
a
flower
that
bloomed
the
same
the
roses
differed
in
the
fashion
of
their
wooing
some
shy
and
blushing
would
show
but
a
glimpse
of
bud
while
others
panting
and
wide
open
seemed
consumed
with
infatuation
for
their
persons
there
were
pert
gay
little
things
that
filed
off
cockade
in
cap
there
were
huge
ones
bursting
with
sensuous
charms
like
portly
sultanas
there
were
impudent
hussies
too
in
coquettish
disarray
on
whose
petals
the
white
traces
of
the
could
be
espied
there
were
virtuous
maids
who
had
donned
garb
like
demure
and
aristocratic
ladies
graceful
and
original
who
contrived
attractive
deshabilles
and
the
roses
offered
their
perfume
as
in
precious
crystal
the
drooping
roses
let
it
drip
drop
by
drop
the
round
roses
exhaled
it
with
the
even
breath
of
slumbering
flowers
while
the
budding
roses
tightly
locked
their
petals
and
only
sent
forth
as
yet
the
faint
sigh
of
maidenhood
i
love
you
i
love
you
softly
repeated
serge
albine
too
was
a
large
rose
a
pallid
rose
that
had
opened
since
the
morning
her
feet
were
white
her
arms
were
rosy
pink
her
neck
was
fair
of
skin
her
throat
bewitchingly
veined
pale
and
exquisite
she
was
fragrant
she
proffered
lips
which
offered
as
in
a
coral
cup
a
perfume
that
was
yet
faint
and
cool
serge
inhaled
that
perfume
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
albine
laughed
the
ring
of
that
laugh
which
sounded
like
a
bird
s
rhythmic
notes
enraptured
serge
what
that
lovely
song
is
yours
he
said
it
is
the
sweetest
i
ever
heard
you
are
indeed
my
then
she
laughed
yet
more
sonorously
pouring
forth
rippling
scales
of
notes
that
melted
into
deeper
ones
it
was
an
endless
laugh
a
cooing
then
a
burst
of
triumphant
music
celebrating
the
delight
of
awakening
love
and
everything
the
roses
the
fragrant
wood
the
whole
of
the
paradou
laughed
in
that
laugh
of
woman
just
born
to
beauty
and
to
love
till
now
the
vast
garden
had
lacked
one
charm
a
winning
voice
which
should
prove
the
living
mirth
of
the
trees
the
streams
and
the
sunlight
now
the
vast
garden
was
endowed
with
that
charm
of
laughter
how
old
are
you
asked
albine
when
her
song
had
ended
in
a
faint
expiring
note
nearly
serge
answered
she
was
amazed
what
he
was
he
too
was
astonished
at
having
made
that
answer
so
glibly
for
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
not
yet
lived
a
day
an
hour
and
how
old
are
you
he
asked
in
his
turn
oh
i
am
then
she
broke
into
laughter
again
quivering
from
head
to
foot
repeating
and
singing
her
age
she
laughed
at
her
sixteen
years
with
a
laugh
that
flowed
on
with
rhythmic
trilling
like
a
streamlet
serge
scanned
her
closely
amazed
at
the
laughing
life
that
transfigured
her
face
he
scarcely
knew
her
now
with
those
dimples
in
her
cheeks
those
lips
between
which
peeped
the
rosy
moistness
of
her
mouth
and
those
eyes
blue
like
bits
of
sky
kindling
with
the
rising
of
the
sun
as
she
threw
back
her
head
she
sent
a
glow
of
warmth
through
him
he
put
out
his
hand
and
fumbled
mechanically
behind
her
neck
what
do
you
want
she
asked
and
suddenly
remembering
she
exclaimed
my
comb
my
comb
that
s
she
gave
him
her
comb
and
let
fall
her
heavy
tresses
a
cloth
of
gold
suddenly
unrolled
and
clothed
her
to
her
hips
some
locks
which
flowed
down
upon
her
breast
gave
as
it
were
a
finishing
touch
to
her
regal
raiment
at
the
sight
of
that
sudden
blaze
serge
uttered
an
exclamation
he
kissed
each
lock
and
burned
his
lips
amidst
that
refulgence
but
albine
now
relieved
herself
of
her
long
silence
and
chatted
and
questioned
unceasingly
oh
how
wretched
you
made
me
you
no
longer
took
any
notice
of
me
and
day
after
day
i
found
myself
useless
and
powerless
worried
out
of
my
wits
like
a
and
yet
the
first
few
days
i
had
done
you
good
you
saw
me
and
spoke
to
me
do
you
remember
when
you
were
lying
down
and
went
to
sleep
on
my
shoulder
and
murmured
that
i
did
you
good
no
said
serge
no
i
don
t
remember
it
i
had
never
seen
you
before
i
have
only
just
seen
you
for
the
first
time
lovely
radiant
never
to
be
she
clapped
her
hands
impatiently
exclaiming
and
my
comb
you
must
remember
how
i
used
to
give
you
my
comb
to
keep
you
quiet
when
you
were
a
little
child
why
you
were
looking
for
it
just
no
i
don
t
remember
your
hair
is
like
fine
silk
i
have
never
kissed
your
hair
at
this
with
some
vexation
she
recounted
certain
particulars
of
his
convalescence
in
the
room
with
the
blue
ceiling
but
he
only
laughed
at
her
and
at
last
closed
her
lips
with
his
hand
saying
with
anxious
weariness
no
be
quiet
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
want
to
know
any
more
i
have
only
just
woke
up
and
found
you
there
covered
with
roses
that
is
and
he
drew
her
once
more
towards
him
and
held
her
there
dreaming
aloud
and
murmuring
perhaps
i
have
lived
before
it
must
have
been
a
long
long
time
ago
i
loved
you
in
a
painful
dream
you
had
the
same
blue
eyes
the
same
rather
long
face
the
same
youthful
mien
but
your
hair
was
carefully
hidden
under
a
linen
cloth
and
i
never
dared
to
remove
that
cloth
because
your
locks
seemed
to
me
fearsome
and
would
have
made
me
die
but
your
hair
is
the
very
sweetness
of
yourself
it
preserves
your
scent
and
when
i
kiss
it
when
i
bury
my
face
in
it
like
this
i
drink
in
your
very
he
kept
on
passing
the
long
curls
through
his
hands
and
pressing
them
to
his
lips
as
if
to
squeeze
from
them
all
albine
s
blood
and
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
continued
it
s
strange
before
one
s
birth
one
dreams
of
being
born
i
was
buried
somewhere
i
was
very
cold
i
could
hear
all
the
life
of
the
world
outside
buzzing
above
me
but
i
shut
my
ears
despairingly
for
i
was
used
to
my
gloomy
den
and
enjoyed
some
fearful
delights
in
it
so
that
i
never
sought
to
free
myself
from
all
the
earth
weighing
upon
my
chest
where
could
i
have
been
then
who
was
it
gave
me
light
he
struggled
to
remember
while
albine
now
waited
in
fear
and
trembling
lest
he
should
really
do
so
smiling
she
took
a
handful
of
her
hair
and
wound
it
round
the
young
man
s
neck
thus
fastening
him
to
herself
this
playful
act
roused
him
from
his
musings
you
re
right
he
said
i
am
yours
what
does
the
rest
matter
it
was
you
was
it
not
who
drew
me
out
of
the
earth
i
must
have
been
under
this
garden
what
i
heard
were
your
steps
rattling
the
little
pebbles
in
the
path
you
were
looking
for
me
you
brought
down
upon
my
head
the
songs
of
the
birds
the
scent
of
the
pinks
the
warmth
of
the
sun
i
fancied
that
you
would
find
me
at
last
i
waited
a
long
time
for
you
but
i
never
expected
that
you
would
give
yourself
to
me
without
your
veil
with
your
hair
undone
the
terrible
hair
which
has
become
so
he
sat
her
on
his
lap
placing
his
face
beside
hers
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
we
are
alone
for
ever
we
love
each
and
thus
in
all
innocence
they
lingered
in
each
other
s
arms
for
a
long
long
time
did
they
remain
there
forgetfully
the
sun
rose
higher
and
the
dust
of
light
fell
hotter
from
the
lofty
boughs
the
yellow
and
white
and
crimson
roses
were
now
only
a
ray
of
their
delight
a
sign
of
their
smiles
to
one
another
they
had
certainly
caused
buds
to
open
around
them
the
roses
crowned
their
heads
and
threw
garlands
about
their
waists
and
the
scent
of
the
roses
became
so
penetrating
so
strong
with
amorous
emotion
that
it
seemed
to
be
the
scent
of
their
own
breath
at
last
serge
put
up
albine
s
hair
he
raised
it
in
handfuls
with
delightful
awkwardness
and
stuck
her
comb
askew
in
the
enormous
knot
that
he
had
heaped
upon
her
head
and
as
it
happened
she
looked
bewitching
thus
then
rising
from
the
ground
he
held
out
his
hands
to
her
and
supported
her
waist
as
she
got
up
they
still
smiled
without
speaking
a
word
and
slowly
they
went
down
the
path
vii
albine
and
serge
entered
the
flower
garden
she
was
watching
him
with
tender
anxiety
fearing
lest
he
should
overtire
himself
but
he
reassured
her
with
a
light
laugh
he
felt
strong
enough
indeed
to
carry
her
whithersoever
she
listed
when
he
found
himself
once
more
in
the
full
sunlight
he
drew
a
sigh
of
content
at
last
he
lived
he
was
no
longer
a
plant
subject
to
the
terrible
sufferings
of
winter
and
how
he
was
moved
with
loving
gratitude
had
it
been
within
his
power
he
would
have
spared
albine
s
tiny
feet
even
the
roughness
of
the
paths
he
dreamed
of
carrying
her
clinging
round
his
neck
like
a
child
lulled
to
sleep
by
her
mother
he
already
watched
over
her
with
a
guardian
s
watchful
care
thrusting
aside
the
stones
and
brambles
jealous
lest
the
breeze
should
waft
a
fleeting
kiss
upon
those
darling
locks
which
were
his
alone
she
on
her
side
nestled
against
his
shoulder
and
serenely
yielded
to
his
guidance
thus
albine
and
serge
strolled
on
together
in
the
sunlight
for
the
first
time
a
balmy
fragrance
floated
in
their
wake
the
very
path
on
which
the
sun
had
unrolled
a
golden
carpet
thrilled
with
delight
under
their
feet
between
the
tall
flowering
shrubs
they
passed
like
a
vision
of
such
wondrous
charm
that
the
distant
paths
seemed
to
entreat
their
presence
and
hail
them
with
a
murmur
of
admiration
even
as
crowds
hail
sovereigns
they
formed
one
sole
supremely
lovely
being
albine
s
snowy
skin
was
but
the
whiteness
of
serge
s
browner
skin
and
slowly
they
passed
along
clothed
with
sunlight
nay
they
were
themselves
the
sun
worshipped
by
the
low
bending
flowers
a
tide
of
emotion
now
stirred
the
paradou
to
its
depths
the
old
flower
garden
escorted
them
that
vast
field
bearing
a
century
s
untrammelled
growth
that
nook
of
paradise
sown
by
the
breeze
with
the
choicest
flowers
the
blissful
peace
of
the
paradou
slumbering
in
the
broad
sunlight
prevented
the
degeneration
of
species
it
could
boast
of
a
temperature
ever
equable
and
a
soil
which
every
plant
had
long
enriched
to
thrive
therein
in
the
silence
of
its
vigour
its
vegetation
was
mighty
magnificent
luxuriantly
untended
full
of
erratic
growths
decked
with
monstrous
blossoming
unknown
to
the
spade
and
of
gardeners
nature
left
to
herself
free
to
grow
as
she
listed
in
the
depths
of
that
solitude
protected
by
natural
shelters
threw
restraint
aside
more
heartily
at
each
return
of
spring
indulged
in
mighty
gambols
delighted
in
offering
herself
at
all
seasons
strange
nosegays
not
meant
for
any
hand
to
pluck
a
rabid
fury
seemed
to
impel
her
to
overthrow
whatever
the
effort
of
man
had
created
she
rebelliously
cast
a
straggling
multitude
of
flowers
over
the
paths
attacked
the
rockeries
with
an
tide
of
moss
and
knotted
round
the
necks
of
marble
statues
the
flexible
cords
of
creepers
with
which
she
threw
them
down
she
shattered
the
stonework
of
the
fountains
steps
and
terraces
with
shrubs
which
burst
through
them
she
slowly
creepingly
spread
over
the
smallest
cultivated
plots
moulding
them
to
her
fancy
and
planting
on
them
as
ensign
of
rebellion
some
wayside
spore
some
lowly
weed
which
she
transformed
into
a
gigantic
growth
of
verdure
in
days
gone
by
the
parterre
tended
by
a
master
passionately
fond
of
flowers
had
displayed
in
its
trim
beds
and
borders
a
wondrous
wealth
of
choice
blossoms
and
the
same
plants
could
still
be
found
but
perpetuated
grown
into
such
numberless
families
and
scampering
in
such
mad
fashion
throughout
the
whole
garden
that
the
place
was
now
all
riot
to
its
very
walls
a
very
den
of
debauchery
where
intoxicated
nature
had
hiccups
of
verbena
and
pinks
though
to
outward
seeming
albine
had
yielded
her
weaker
self
to
the
guidance
of
serge
to
whose
shoulder
she
clung
it
was
she
who
really
led
him
she
took
him
first
to
the
grotto
deep
within
a
clump
of
poplars
and
willows
gaped
a
cavern
formed
by
rugged
bits
of
rocks
which
had
fallen
over
a
basin
where
tiny
rills
of
water
trickled
between
the
stones
the
grotto
was
completely
lost
to
sight
beneath
the
onslaught
of
vegetation
below
row
upon
row
of
hollyhocks
seemed
to
bar
all
entrance
with
a
of
red
yellow
mauve
and
flowers
whose
stems
were
hidden
among
colossal
nettles
which
calmly
exuded
blistering
poison
above
them
was
a
mighty
swarm
of
creepers
which
leaped
aloft
in
a
few
bounds
jasmines
starred
with
balmy
flowers
wistarias
with
delicate
lacelike
leaves
dense
ivy
dentated
and
resembling
varnished
metal
lithe
honeysuckle
laden
with
pale
coral
sprays
amorous
clematideae
reaching
out
arms
all
tufted
with
white
aigrettes
and
among
them
twined
yet
slenderer
plants
binding
them
more
and
more
closely
together
weaving
them
into
a
fragrant
woof
nasturtium
bare
and
green
of
skin
showed
open
mouths
of
ruddy
gold
scarlet
runners
tough
as
whipcord
kindled
here
and
there
a
fire
of
gleaming
sparks
convolvuli
opened
their
leaves
and
with
thousands
of
little
bells
rang
a
silent
peal
of
exquisite
colours
sweetpeas
like
swarms
of
settling
butterflies
folded
tawny
or
rosy
wings
ready
to
be
borne
yet
farther
away
by
the
first
breeze
it
was
all
a
wealth
of
leafy
locks
sprinkled
with
a
shower
of
flowers
straying
away
in
wild
dishevelment
and
suggesting
the
head
of
some
giantess
thrown
back
in
a
spasm
of
passion
with
a
streaming
of
magnificent
hair
which
spread
into
a
pool
of
perfume
i
have
never
dared
to
venture
into
all
that
darkness
albine
whispered
to
serge
he
urged
her
on
carried
her
over
the
nettles
and
as
a
great
boulder
barred
the
way
into
the
grotto
he
held
her
up
for
a
moment
in
his
arms
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
peer
through
the
opening
that
yawned
at
a
few
feet
from
the
ground
a
marble
woman
she
whispered
has
fallen
full
length
into
the
stream
the
water
has
eaten
her
face
then
he
too
in
his
turn
wanted
to
look
and
pulled
himself
up
a
cold
breeze
played
upon
his
cheeks
in
the
pale
light
that
glided
through
the
hole
he
saw
the
marble
woman
lying
amidst
the
reeds
and
the
duckweed
she
was
naked
to
the
waist
she
must
have
been
drowning
there
for
the
last
hundred
years
some
grief
had
probably
flung
her
into
that
spring
where
she
was
slowly
committing
suicide
the
clear
water
which
flowed
over
her
had
worn
her
face
into
a
smooth
expanse
of
marble
a
mere
white
surface
without
a
feature
but
her
breasts
raised
out
of
the
water
by
what
appeared
an
effort
of
her
neck
were
still
perfect
and
lifelike
throbbing
even
yet
with
the
joys
of
some
old
delight
she
isn
t
dead
yet
said
serge
getting
down
again
one
day
we
will
come
and
get
her
out
of
but
albine
shuddered
and
led
him
away
they
passed
out
again
into
the
sunlight
and
the
rank
luxuriance
of
beds
and
borders
they
wandered
through
a
field
of
flowers
capriciously
at
random
their
feet
trod
a
carpet
of
lovely
dwarf
plants
which
had
once
neatly
fringed
the
walks
and
now
spread
about
in
wild
profusion
in
succession
they
passed
through
the
spotted
silk
of
soft
rose
catchflies
through
the
tufted
satin
of
feathered
pinks
and
the
blue
velvet
of
studded
with
melancholy
little
eyes
further
on
they
forced
their
way
through
giant
mignonette
which
rose
to
their
knees
like
a
bath
of
perfume
then
they
turned
through
a
patch
of
lilies
of
the
valley
in
order
that
they
might
spare
an
expanse
of
violets
so
that
they
feared
to
hurt
them
but
soon
they
found
themselves
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
violets
and
so
with
wary
gentle
steps
they
passed
over
their
fresh
fragrance
inhaling
the
very
breath
of
springtide
beyond
the
violets
a
mass
of
lobelias
spread
out
like
green
wool
gemmed
with
pale
mauve
the
softly
shaded
stars
of
globularia
the
blue
cups
of
nemophila
the
yellow
crosses
of
saponaria
the
white
and
purple
ones
of
sweet
rocket
wove
patches
of
rich
tapestry
stretching
onward
and
onward
a
fabric
of
royal
luxury
so
that
the
young
couple
might
enjoy
the
delights
of
that
first
walk
together
without
fatigue
but
the
violets
ever
reappeared
real
seas
of
violets
that
rolled
all
round
them
shedding
the
sweetest
perfumes
beneath
their
feet
and
wafting
in
their
wake
the
breath
of
their
flowerets
albine
and
serge
quite
lost
themselves
thousands
of
loftier
plants
towered
up
in
hedges
around
them
enclosing
narrow
paths
which
they
found
it
delightful
to
thread
these
paths
twisted
and
turned
wandered
through
dense
thickets
there
were
ageratums
with
tufts
of
bloom
woodruffs
with
soft
musky
perfume
mimuluses
blotched
with
bright
vermilion
lofty
phloxes
crimson
and
violet
throwing
up
distaffs
of
flowers
for
the
breezes
to
spin
red
flax
with
sprays
as
fine
as
hair
chrysanthemums
like
full
golden
moons
casting
short
faint
rays
white
and
violet
and
rose
around
them
the
young
couple
surmounted
all
the
obstacles
that
lay
in
their
path
and
continued
their
way
betwixt
the
walls
of
verdure
to
the
right
of
them
sprang
up
the
slim
fraxinella
the
centranthus
draped
with
snowy
blossoms
and
the
greyish
in
each
of
whose
tiny
flowercups
gleamed
a
dewdrop
to
their
left
was
a
long
row
of
columbines
of
every
variety
white
ones
pale
rose
ones
and
some
of
deep
violet
hues
almost
black
that
seemed
to
be
in
mourning
the
blossoms
that
drooped
from
their
lofty
branching
stems
being
plaited
and
goffered
like
crape
then
as
they
advanced
further
on
the
character
of
the
hedges
changed
giant
larkspurs
thrust
up
their
between
the
dentated
foliage
of
which
gaped
the
mouths
of
tawny
snapdragons
while
the
schizanthus
reared
its
scanty
leaves
and
fluttering
blooms
that
looked
like
butterflies
wings
of
sulphur
hue
splashed
with
soft
lake
the
blue
bells
of
campanulae
swayed
aloft
some
of
them
even
over
the
tall
asphodels
whose
golden
stems
served
as
their
steeples
in
one
corner
was
a
giant
fennel
that
reminded
one
of
a
lady
spreading
out
a
sunshade
of
satin
then
the
pair
suddenly
found
their
way
blocked
it
was
impossible
to
advance
any
further
a
mass
of
flowers
a
huge
sheaf
of
plants
stopped
all
progress
down
below
a
mass
of
formed
as
it
were
a
pedestal
from
the
midst
of
which
sprang
scarlet
geum
rhodanthe
with
stiff
petals
and
clarkia
with
great
white
carved
crosses
that
looked
like
the
insignia
of
some
barbarous
order
higher
up
still
bloomed
the
rosy
viscaria
the
yellow
leptosiphon
the
white
colinsia
and
the
lagurus
whose
dusty
green
bloom
contrasted
with
the
glowing
colours
around
it
towering
over
all
these
growths
scarlet
foxgloves
and
blue
lupins
rising
in
slender
columns
formed
a
sort
of
oriental
rotunda
gleaming
vividly
with
crimson
and
azure
while
at
the
very
summit
like
a
surmounting
dome
of
dusky
copper
were
the
ruddy
leaves
of
a
colossal
as
serge
reached
out
his
hands
to
try
to
force
a
passage
albine
stopped
him
and
begged
him
not
to
injure
the
flowers
you
will
break
the
stems
and
crush
the
leaves
she
said
ever
since
i
have
been
here
i
have
always
taken
care
to
hurt
none
of
them
come
and
i
will
show
you
the
she
made
him
turn
and
led
him
from
the
narrow
paths
to
the
centre
of
the
parterre
where
once
upon
a
time
great
basins
had
been
hollowed
out
but
these
had
now
fallen
into
ruin
and
were
nothing
but
gigantic
fringed
with
stained
and
cracked
marble
in
one
of
the
largest
of
them
the
wind
had
sown
a
wonderful
basketful
of
pansies
the
velvety
blooms
seemed
almost
like
living
faces
with
bands
of
violet
hair
yellow
eyes
paler
tinted
mouths
and
chins
of
a
delicate
flesh
colour
when
i
was
younger
they
used
to
make
me
quite
afraid
murmured
albine
look
at
them
wouldn
t
you
think
that
they
were
thousands
of
little
faces
looking
up
at
you
from
the
ground
and
they
turn
too
all
in
the
same
direction
they
might
be
a
lot
of
buried
dolls
thrusting
their
heads
out
of
the
she
led
him
still
further
on
they
went
the
round
of
all
the
other
basins
in
the
next
one
a
number
of
amaranthuses
had
sprung
up
raising
monstrous
crests
which
albine
had
always
shrunk
from
touching
such
was
their
resemblance
to
big
bleeding
caterpillars
balsams
of
all
colours
now
now
the
hue
of
now
now
grey
like
flax
filled
another
basin
where
their
seed
pods
split
with
little
snaps
then
in
the
midst
of
a
ruined
fountain
there
flourished
a
colony
of
splendid
carnations
white
ones
hung
over
the
rims
and
flaked
ones
thrust
a
bright
medley
of
blossom
between
the
chinks
of
the
marble
while
from
the
mouth
of
the
lion
whence
formerly
the
had
spurted
a
huge
crimson
clove
now
shot
out
so
vigorously
that
the
decrepit
beast
seemed
to
be
spouting
blood
near
by
the
principal
piece
of
ornamental
water
a
lake
on
whose
surface
swans
had
glided
had
now
become
a
thicket
of
lilacs
beneath
whose
shade
stocks
and
verbenas
and
screened
their
delicate
tints
and
dozed
away
all
redolent
of
perfume
but
we
haven
t
seen
half
the
flowers
yet
said
albine
proudly
over
yonder
there
are
such
huge
ones
that
i
can
quite
bury
myself
amongst
them
like
a
partridge
in
a
they
went
thither
they
tripped
down
some
broad
steps
from
whose
fallen
urns
still
flickered
the
violet
fires
of
the
iris
all
down
the
steps
streamed
gilliflowers
like
liquid
gold
the
sides
were
flanked
with
thistles
that
shot
up
like
candelabra
of
green
bronze
twisted
and
curved
into
the
semblance
of
birds
heads
with
all
the
fantastic
elegance
of
chinese
between
the
broken
balustrades
drooped
tresses
of
stonecrop
light
greenish
locks
spotted
as
with
mouldiness
then
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
another
parterre
spread
out
dotted
over
with
that
were
vigorous
as
oaks
which
had
once
been
carefully
pruned
and
clipped
into
balls
and
pyramids
and
octagonal
columns
but
which
were
now
revelling
in
unrestrained
freedom
of
untidiness
breaking
out
into
ragged
masses
of
greenery
through
which
blue
patches
of
sky
were
visible
and
albine
led
serge
straight
on
to
a
spot
that
seemed
to
be
the
graveyard
of
the
there
the
scabious
mourned
and
processions
of
poppies
stretched
out
in
line
with
deathly
odour
unfolding
heavy
blooms
of
feverish
brilliance
sad
anemones
clustered
in
weary
throngs
pallid
as
if
infected
by
some
epidemic
daturas
spread
out
purplish
horns
from
which
insects
weary
of
life
sucked
fatal
poison
marigolds
buried
with
choking
foliage
their
writhing
starry
flowers
that
already
reeked
of
putrefaction
and
there
were
other
melancholy
flowers
also
fleshy
ranunculi
with
rusty
tints
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
that
exhaled
asphyxia
and
died
from
their
own
perfume
but
the
cinerarias
were
most
conspicuous
crowding
thickly
in
robes
of
violet
and
white
in
the
middle
of
this
gloomy
spot
a
mutilated
marble
cupid
still
remained
standing
smiling
beneath
the
lichens
which
overspread
his
youthful
nakedness
while
the
arm
with
which
he
had
once
held
his
bow
lay
low
amongst
the
nettles
then
albine
and
serge
passed
on
through
a
rank
growth
of
peonies
reaching
to
their
waists
the
white
flowers
fell
to
pieces
as
they
passed
with
a
rain
of
snowy
petals
which
was
as
refreshing
to
their
hands
as
the
heavy
drops
of
a
thunder
shower
and
the
red
ones
grinned
with
apoplectical
faces
which
perturbed
them
next
they
passed
through
a
field
of
fuchsias
forming
dense
vigorous
shrubs
that
delighted
them
with
their
countless
bells
then
they
went
on
through
fields
of
purple
veronicas
and
others
of
geraniums
blazing
with
all
the
fiery
tints
of
a
brasier
which
the
wind
seemed
to
be
ever
fanning
into
fresh
heat
and
they
forced
their
way
through
a
jungle
of
gladioli
tall
as
reeds
which
threw
up
spikes
of
flowers
that
gleamed
in
the
full
daylight
with
all
the
brilliance
of
burning
torches
they
lost
themselves
too
in
a
forest
of
sunflowers
with
stalks
as
thick
as
albine
s
wrist
a
forest
darkened
by
rough
leaves
large
enough
to
form
an
infant
s
bed
and
peopled
with
giant
starry
faces
that
shone
like
so
many
suns
and
thence
they
passed
into
another
forest
a
forest
of
rhododendrons
so
teeming
with
blossom
that
the
branches
and
leaves
were
completely
hidden
and
nothing
but
huge
nosegays
masses
of
soft
calyces
could
be
seen
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
come
along
we
have
not
got
to
the
end
yet
cried
albine
let
us
push
but
serge
stopped
they
were
now
in
the
midst
of
an
old
ruined
colonnade
some
of
the
columns
offered
inviting
seats
as
they
lay
prostrate
amongst
primroses
and
periwinkles
further
away
among
the
columns
that
still
remained
upright
other
flowers
were
growing
in
profusion
there
were
expanses
of
tulips
showing
brilliant
streaks
like
painted
china
expanses
of
calceolarias
dotted
with
crimson
and
gold
expanses
of
zinnias
like
great
daisies
expanses
of
petunias
with
petals
like
soft
cambric
through
which
rosy
flesh
tints
gleamed
and
other
fields
with
flowers
they
could
not
recognise
spreading
in
carpets
beneath
the
sun
in
a
motley
brilliance
that
was
softened
by
the
green
of
their
leaves
we
shall
never
be
able
to
see
it
all
said
serge
smiling
and
waving
his
hand
it
would
be
very
nice
to
sit
down
here
amongst
all
this
near
them
there
was
a
large
patch
of
heliotropes
whose
breath
permeated
the
air
with
velvety
softness
they
sat
down
upon
one
of
the
fallen
columns
in
the
midst
of
a
cluster
of
magnificent
lilies
which
had
shot
up
there
they
had
been
walking
for
more
than
an
hour
they
had
wandered
on
through
the
flowers
from
the
roses
to
the
lilies
these
offered
them
a
calm
quiet
haven
after
their
lovers
ramble
amid
the
perfumed
solicitations
of
luscious
honeysuckle
musky
violets
verbenas
that
breathed
out
the
warm
scent
of
kisses
and
tuberoses
that
panted
with
voluptuous
passion
the
lilies
with
their
tall
slim
stems
shot
up
round
them
like
a
white
pavilion
and
sheltered
them
with
snowy
cups
gleaming
only
with
the
gold
of
their
slender
pistils
and
there
they
rested
like
betrothed
children
in
a
tower
of
purity
an
impregnable
ivory
tower
where
all
their
love
was
yet
perfect
innocence
albine
and
serge
lingered
amongst
the
lilies
till
evening
they
felt
so
happy
there
and
seemed
to
break
out
into
a
new
life
serge
felt
the
last
trace
of
fever
leave
his
hands
while
albine
grew
quite
white
with
a
milky
whiteness
untinted
by
any
rosy
hue
they
were
unconscious
that
their
arms
and
necks
and
shoulders
were
bare
and
their
straying
unconfined
hair
in
nowise
troubled
them
they
laughed
merrily
one
at
the
other
with
frank
open
laughter
the
expression
of
their
eyes
retained
the
limpid
calmness
of
clear
spring
water
when
they
quitted
the
lilies
their
feelings
were
but
those
of
children
ten
years
old
it
seemed
to
them
that
they
had
just
met
each
other
in
that
garden
so
that
they
might
be
friends
for
ever
and
amuse
themselves
with
perpetual
play
and
as
they
returned
through
the
parterre
the
very
flowers
bore
themselves
discreetly
as
though
they
were
glad
to
see
their
childishness
and
would
do
nothing
that
might
corrupt
them
the
forests
of
peonies
the
masses
of
carnations
the
carpets
of
the
curtains
of
clematis
now
steeped
in
the
atmosphere
of
evening
slumbering
in
childlike
purity
akin
to
their
own
no
longer
spread
suggestions
of
voluptuousness
around
them
the
pansies
looked
up
at
them
with
their
little
candid
faces
like
playfellows
and
the
languid
mignonette
as
albine
s
white
skirt
brushed
by
it
seemed
full
of
compassion
and
held
its
breath
lest
it
should
fan
their
love
prematurely
into
life
viii
at
dawn
the
next
day
it
was
serge
who
called
albine
she
slept
in
a
room
on
the
upper
floor
he
looked
up
at
her
window
and
saw
her
throw
open
the
shutters
just
as
she
had
sprung
out
of
bed
they
laughed
merrily
as
their
eyes
met
you
must
not
go
out
said
albine
when
she
came
down
we
must
stay
indoors
and
rest
i
will
take
you
a
long
long
way
off
to
a
spot
where
we
can
have
a
very
jolly
but
sha
n
t
we
grow
tired
of
stopping
here
muttered
serge
oh
dear
no
i
will
tell
you
they
passed
a
delightful
day
the
windows
were
thrown
wide
open
and
all
the
beauty
of
the
paradou
came
in
and
rejoiced
with
them
in
the
room
serge
now
really
took
possession
of
that
delightful
room
where
he
imagined
he
had
been
born
he
insisted
upon
seeing
everything
and
upon
having
everything
explained
to
him
the
plaster
cupids
who
sported
round
the
alcove
amused
him
so
much
that
he
mounted
upon
a
chair
to
tie
albine
s
sash
round
the
neck
of
the
smallest
of
them
a
little
bit
of
a
man
who
was
turning
somersaults
with
his
head
downward
albine
clapped
her
hands
and
said
that
he
looked
like
a
cockchafer
fastened
by
a
string
then
as
though
seized
by
an
access
of
pity
she
said
no
no
unfasten
him
it
prevents
him
from
but
it
was
the
cupids
painted
over
the
doors
that
more
particularly
attracted
serge
s
attention
he
fidgeted
at
not
being
able
to
make
out
what
they
were
playing
at
for
the
paintings
had
grown
very
dim
helped
by
albine
he
dragged
a
table
to
the
wall
and
when
they
both
had
climbed
upon
it
albine
began
to
explain
things
to
him
look
now
those
are
throwing
flowers
under
the
flowers
you
can
only
see
some
bare
legs
it
seems
to
me
that
when
first
i
came
here
i
could
make
out
a
lady
reposing
there
but
she
has
been
gone
for
a
long
time
they
examined
all
the
panels
in
turn
but
they
had
faded
to
such
a
degree
that
little
more
could
be
distinguished
than
the
knees
and
elbows
of
infants
the
details
which
had
doubtless
delighted
the
eyes
of
those
whose
passion
seemed
to
linger
round
the
alcove
had
so
completely
disappeared
under
the
influence
of
the
fresh
air
that
the
room
like
the
park
seemed
restored
to
pristine
virginity
beneath
the
serene
glory
of
the
sun
oh
they
are
only
some
little
boys
playing
said
serge
as
he
descended
from
the
table
do
you
know
how
to
play
at
hot
cockles
there
was
no
game
that
albine
did
not
know
how
to
play
at
but
for
hot
cockles
at
least
three
players
are
necessary
and
that
made
them
laugh
serge
protested
however
that
they
got
on
too
well
together
ever
to
desire
a
third
there
and
they
vowed
that
they
would
always
remain
by
themselves
we
are
quite
alone
here
one
can
not
hear
a
sound
said
the
young
man
lolling
on
the
couch
and
all
the
furniture
has
such
a
pleasant
smell
the
place
is
as
snug
as
a
nest
we
ought
to
be
very
happy
in
this
the
girl
shook
her
head
gravely
if
i
had
been
at
all
timid
she
murmured
i
should
have
been
very
much
frightened
at
first
that
is
one
of
the
stories
i
want
to
tell
you
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
told
it
to
me
perhaps
it
isn
t
true
but
it
will
amuse
us
at
any
then
she
came
and
sat
down
by
serge
s
side
it
is
years
and
years
since
it
all
happened
the
paradou
belonged
to
a
rich
lord
who
came
and
shut
himself
up
in
it
with
a
very
beautiful
lady
the
gates
of
the
mansion
were
kept
so
tightly
closed
and
the
garden
walls
were
built
so
very
high
that
no
one
ever
caught
sight
even
of
the
lady
s
ah
i
know
serge
interrupted
the
lady
was
never
seen
then
as
albine
looked
at
him
in
surprise
somewhat
annoyed
to
find
that
he
knew
her
story
already
he
added
in
a
low
voice
apparently
a
little
astonished
himself
you
told
me
the
story
before
you
she
declared
that
she
had
never
done
so
but
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
change
her
mind
and
allowed
herself
to
be
convinced
however
that
did
not
prevent
her
from
finishing
her
tale
in
these
words
when
the
lord
went
away
his
hair
was
quite
white
he
had
all
the
gates
barricaded
up
so
that
no
one
might
get
inside
and
disturb
the
lady
it
was
in
this
room
that
she
in
this
room
cried
serge
you
never
told
me
that
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
was
really
in
this
room
she
died
albine
seemed
put
out
she
repeated
to
him
what
every
one
in
the
neighbourhood
knew
the
lord
had
built
the
pavilion
for
the
reception
of
this
unknown
lady
who
looked
like
a
princess
the
servants
employed
at
the
mansion
afterwards
declared
that
he
spent
all
his
days
and
nights
there
often
too
they
saw
him
in
one
of
the
walks
guiding
the
tiny
feet
of
the
mysterious
lady
towards
the
densest
coppices
but
for
all
the
world
they
would
never
have
ventured
to
spy
upon
the
pair
who
sometimes
scoured
the
park
for
weeks
together
and
it
was
here
she
died
repeated
serge
who
felt
touched
with
sorrow
and
you
have
taken
her
room
you
use
her
furniture
and
you
sleep
in
her
albine
smiled
ah
well
you
know
i
am
not
timid
besides
it
is
so
long
since
it
all
happened
you
said
what
a
delightful
room
it
then
they
both
dropped
into
silence
and
glanced
for
a
moment
towards
the
alcove
the
lofty
ceiling
and
the
corners
steeped
in
grey
gloom
the
faded
furniture
seemed
to
speak
of
long
past
love
a
gentle
sigh
as
of
resignation
passed
through
the
room
no
indeed
murmured
serge
one
could
not
feel
afraid
here
it
is
too
but
albine
came
closer
to
him
and
said
there
is
something
else
that
only
a
few
people
know
and
that
is
that
the
lord
and
the
lady
discovered
in
the
garden
a
certain
spot
where
perfect
happiness
was
to
be
found
and
where
they
afterwards
spent
all
their
time
i
have
been
told
that
by
a
very
good
authority
it
is
a
cool
shady
spot
hidden
away
in
the
midst
of
an
impenetrable
jungle
and
it
is
so
marvellously
beautiful
that
anyone
who
reaches
it
forgets
all
else
in
the
world
the
poor
lady
must
have
been
buried
is
it
anywhere
about
the
parterre
asked
serge
curiously
ah
i
can
not
tell
i
can
not
tell
said
the
young
girl
with
an
expression
of
discouragement
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
have
searched
everywhere
but
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
the
least
sign
of
that
lovely
clearing
it
is
not
amongst
the
roses
nor
the
lilies
nor
the
perhaps
it
is
hidden
somewhere
away
amongst
those
flowers
where
you
showed
me
the
figure
of
a
boy
standing
with
his
arm
broken
no
no
perhaps
then
it
is
in
that
grotto
near
that
clear
stream
where
the
great
marble
woman
without
a
face
is
no
albine
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
moment
then
as
though
speaking
to
herself
she
went
on
as
soon
as
ever
i
came
here
i
began
to
hunt
for
it
i
spent
whole
days
in
the
paradou
and
ferreted
about
in
all
the
green
corners
to
have
the
pleasure
of
sitting
for
an
hour
in
that
happy
spot
what
mornings
have
i
not
wasted
in
groping
under
the
brambles
and
peeping
into
the
most
distant
nooks
of
the
park
oh
i
should
have
known
it
at
once
that
enchanting
retreat
with
the
mighty
tree
that
must
shelter
it
with
a
canopy
of
foliage
with
its
carpet
of
soft
silky
turf
and
its
walls
of
tangled
greenery
which
the
very
birds
themselves
can
not
penetrate
she
raised
her
voice
and
threw
one
of
her
arms
round
serge
s
neck
as
she
continued
tell
me
now
shall
we
search
for
it
together
we
shall
surely
find
it
you
who
are
strong
will
push
aside
the
heavy
branches
while
i
crawl
underneath
and
search
the
brakes
when
i
grow
weary
you
can
carry
me
you
can
help
me
to
cross
the
streams
and
if
we
happen
to
lose
ourselves
you
can
climb
the
trees
and
try
to
discover
our
way
again
ah
and
how
delightful
it
will
be
for
us
to
sit
side
by
side
beneath
the
green
canopy
in
the
centre
of
the
clearing
i
have
been
told
that
in
one
minute
one
may
there
live
the
whole
of
life
tell
me
my
dear
serge
shall
we
set
off
and
scour
the
park
from
bush
to
bush
until
we
have
found
what
we
want
serge
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
smiled
what
would
be
the
use
he
said
is
it
not
pleasant
in
the
parterre
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
remain
among
the
flowers
instead
of
seeking
a
greater
happiness
that
lies
so
far
away
it
is
there
that
the
dead
lady
lies
buried
murmured
albine
falling
back
into
her
reverie
it
was
the
joy
of
being
there
that
killed
her
the
tree
casts
a
shade
whose
charm
is
deathly
i
would
willingly
die
so
we
would
clasp
one
another
there
and
we
would
die
and
none
would
ever
find
us
don
t
talk
like
that
interrupted
serge
you
make
me
feel
so
unhappy
i
would
rather
that
we
should
live
in
the
bright
sunlight
far
away
from
that
fatal
shade
your
words
distress
me
as
though
they
urged
us
to
some
irreparable
misfortune
it
must
be
forbidden
to
sit
beneath
a
tree
whose
shade
can
thus
affect
yes
albine
gravely
declared
it
is
forbidden
all
the
folks
of
the
countryside
have
told
me
that
it
is
then
silence
fell
serge
rose
from
the
couch
where
he
had
been
lolling
and
laughed
and
pretended
that
he
did
not
care
about
stories
the
sun
was
setting
however
before
albine
would
consent
to
go
into
the
garden
for
even
a
few
minutes
she
led
serge
to
the
left
along
the
enclosing
wall
to
a
spot
strewn
with
fragments
of
stone
and
woodwork
and
ironwork
bristling
too
with
briars
and
brambles
it
was
the
site
of
the
old
mansion
still
black
with
traces
of
the
fire
which
had
destroyed
the
building
underneath
the
briars
lay
rotting
timbers
and
masonry
the
spot
was
like
a
little
ravined
hillocky
wilderness
of
sterile
rocks
draped
with
rude
vegetation
clinging
creepers
that
twined
and
twisted
through
every
crevice
like
green
serpents
the
young
folks
amused
themselves
by
wandering
across
this
chaos
groping
about
in
the
holes
turning
over
the
debris
trying
to
reconstruct
something
of
the
past
out
of
the
ruins
before
them
they
did
not
confess
their
curiosity
as
they
chased
one
another
through
the
midst
of
fallen
floorings
and
overturned
partitions
but
they
were
indeed
all
the
time
secretly
pondering
over
the
legend
of
those
ruins
and
of
that
lady
lovelier
than
day
whose
silken
skirt
had
rustled
down
those
steps
where
now
lizards
alone
were
idly
crawling
serge
ended
by
climbing
the
highest
of
the
ruinous
masses
and
looking
round
at
the
park
which
unfolded
its
vast
expanse
of
greenery
he
sought
the
grey
form
of
the
pavilion
through
the
trees
albine
was
standing
silent
by
his
side
serious
once
more
the
pavilion
is
yonder
to
the
right
she
said
at
last
without
waiting
for
serge
to
ask
her
it
is
the
only
one
of
the
buildings
that
is
left
you
can
see
it
quite
plainly
at
the
end
of
that
grove
of
they
fell
into
silence
again
and
then
albine
as
though
pursuing
aloud
the
reflections
which
were
passing
through
their
minds
exclaimed
when
he
went
to
see
her
he
must
have
gone
down
yonder
path
then
past
those
big
chestnut
trees
and
then
under
the
limes
it
wouldn
t
take
him
a
quarter
of
an
serge
made
no
reply
but
as
they
went
home
they
took
the
path
which
albine
had
pointed
out
past
the
chestnuts
and
under
the
limes
it
was
a
path
that
love
had
consecrated
and
as
they
walked
over
the
grass
they
seemed
to
be
seeking
footmarks
or
a
fallen
knot
of
ribbon
or
a
whiff
of
ancient
perfume
something
that
would
clearly
satisfy
them
that
they
were
really
travelling
along
the
path
that
led
to
the
joy
of
union
wait
out
here
said
albine
when
they
once
more
stood
before
the
pavilion
don
t
come
up
for
three
then
she
ran
off
merrily
and
shut
herself
up
in
the
room
with
the
blue
ceiling
and
when
she
had
let
serge
knock
at
the
door
twice
she
softly
set
it
ajar
and
received
him
with
an
courtesy
good
morrow
my
dear
lord
she
said
as
she
embraced
him
this
amused
them
extremely
they
played
at
being
lovers
with
childish
glee
in
stammering
accents
they
would
have
revived
the
passion
which
had
once
throbbed
and
died
there
but
it
was
like
a
first
effort
at
learning
a
lesson
they
knew
not
how
to
kiss
each
other
s
lips
but
sought
each
other
s
cheeks
and
ended
by
dancing
around
each
other
with
shrieks
of
laughter
from
ignorance
of
any
other
way
of
showing
the
pleasure
they
experienced
from
their
mutual
love
ix
the
next
morning
albine
was
anxious
to
start
at
sunrise
upon
the
grand
expedition
which
she
had
planned
the
night
before
she
tapped
her
feet
gleefully
on
the
ground
and
declared
that
they
would
not
come
back
before
nightfall
where
are
you
going
to
take
me
asked
serge
you
will
see
you
will
but
he
caught
her
by
the
hands
and
looked
her
very
earnestly
in
the
face
you
must
not
be
foolish
you
know
i
won
t
have
you
hunting
for
that
glade
of
yours
or
for
the
tree
or
for
the
grassy
couch
where
one
droops
and
dies
you
know
that
it
is
she
blushed
slightly
protesting
that
she
had
no
such
idea
in
her
head
then
she
added
but
if
we
should
come
across
them
just
by
chance
you
know
and
without
really
seeking
them
you
wouldn
t
mind
sitting
down
would
you
else
you
must
love
me
very
they
set
off
going
straight
through
the
parterre
without
stopping
to
watch
the
awakening
of
the
flowers
which
were
all
dripping
after
their
dewy
bath
the
morning
had
a
rosy
hue
the
smile
of
a
beautiful
child
just
opening
its
eyes
on
its
snowy
pillow
where
are
you
taking
me
repeated
serge
but
albine
only
laughed
and
would
not
answer
then
on
reaching
the
stream
which
ran
through
the
garden
at
the
end
of
the
she
halted
in
great
distress
the
water
was
swollen
with
the
late
rains
we
shall
never
be
able
to
get
across
she
murmured
i
can
generally
manage
it
by
taking
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
but
the
water
would
reach
to
our
they
walked
for
a
moment
or
two
along
the
bank
to
find
some
fordable
point
but
the
girl
said
it
was
hopeless
she
knew
the
stream
quite
well
once
there
had
been
a
bridge
across
but
it
had
fallen
in
and
had
strewn
the
river
bed
with
great
blocks
of
stone
between
which
the
water
rushed
along
in
foaming
eddies
get
on
to
my
back
then
said
serge
no
no
i
d
rather
not
if
you
were
to
slip
we
should
both
of
us
get
a
famous
wetting
you
don
t
know
how
treacherous
those
stones
get
on
to
my
back
repeated
serge
she
was
tempted
to
do
so
she
stepped
back
for
a
spring
and
then
jumped
up
like
a
boy
but
she
felt
that
serge
was
tottering
and
crying
out
that
she
was
not
safely
seated
she
got
down
again
however
after
two
more
attempts
she
managed
to
settle
herself
securely
on
serge
s
back
when
you
are
quite
ready
said
the
young
man
laughing
we
will
start
now
hold
on
tightly
we
are
and
with
three
light
strides
he
crossed
the
stream
scarcely
wetting
even
his
toes
midway
however
albine
thought
that
he
was
slipping
she
broke
out
into
a
little
scream
and
hugged
him
tightly
round
his
neck
but
he
sprang
forward
and
carried
her
at
a
gallop
over
the
fine
sand
on
the
other
side
gee
up
she
cried
quite
calm
again
and
delighted
with
this
novel
game
he
ran
along
with
her
for
some
distance
she
clucking
her
tongue
and
guiding
him
to
right
or
left
by
some
locks
of
his
hair
here
here
we
are
she
said
at
last
tapping
him
gently
on
the
cheeks
then
she
jumped
to
the
ground
while
he
hot
and
perspiring
leaned
against
a
tree
to
draw
breath
albine
thereupon
began
to
scold
him
and
threatened
that
she
would
not
nurse
him
if
he
made
himself
ill
again
stuff
he
cried
it
s
done
me
good
when
i
have
grown
quite
strong
again
i
will
carry
you
about
all
day
but
where
are
you
taking
me
here
she
said
as
she
seated
herself
beneath
a
huge
they
were
in
the
old
orchard
of
the
park
a
hawthorn
hedge
a
real
wall
of
greenery
with
here
and
there
a
gap
separated
it
from
everything
else
there
was
quite
a
forest
of
fruit
trees
which
no
pruning
knife
had
touched
for
a
century
past
some
of
the
trees
had
been
strangely
warped
and
twisted
by
the
storms
which
had
raged
over
them
while
others
bossed
all
over
with
huge
knots
and
full
of
deep
holes
seemed
only
to
hold
on
to
the
soil
with
their
bark
the
high
branches
bent
each
year
by
weight
of
fruit
stretched
out
like
big
rackets
and
each
tree
helped
to
keep
its
fellows
erect
the
trunks
were
like
twisted
pillars
supporting
a
roof
of
greenery
and
sometimes
narrow
cloisters
sometimes
light
halls
were
formed
while
now
and
again
the
verdure
swept
almost
to
the
ground
and
left
scarcely
room
to
pass
round
each
colossus
a
crowd
of
wild
and
saplings
had
grown
up
with
the
entanglement
of
their
young
shoots
in
the
greenish
light
which
filtered
like
tinted
water
through
the
foliage
in
the
deep
silence
of
the
mossy
soil
one
only
heard
the
dull
thud
of
the
fruit
as
it
was
culled
by
the
wind
and
there
were
patriarchal
apricot
trees
that
bore
their
great
age
quite
bravely
though
decayed
on
one
side
where
they
showed
a
perfect
scaffolding
of
dead
wood
they
were
so
youthful
so
full
of
life
that
on
the
other
young
shoots
were
ever
bursting
through
their
rough
bark
there
were
cherry
trees
that
formed
complete
towns
with
houses
of
several
stories
that
threw
out
staircases
and
floors
of
branches
big
enough
for
half
a
score
of
families
then
there
were
the
apple
trees
with
their
limbs
twisted
like
old
cripples
with
bark
gnarled
and
knotted
and
all
stained
with
there
were
also
smooth
pear
trees
that
shot
up
with
long
slender
spars
and
there
were
that
won
a
place
amid
this
teeming
growth
as
pretty
maids
do
amidst
a
human
crowd
by
dint
of
bright
smiles
and
gentle
persistence
some
had
been
formerly
trained
as
espaliers
but
they
had
broken
down
the
low
walls
which
had
once
supported
them
and
now
spread
abroad
in
wild
confusion
freed
from
the
trammels
of
trellis
work
broken
fragments
of
which
still
adhered
to
some
of
their
branches
they
grew
just
as
they
listed
and
resembled
trees
once
neat
and
prim
which
having
gone
astray
now
flaunted
but
vestiges
of
whilom
respectability
and
from
tree
to
tree
and
from
bough
to
bough
vine
branches
hung
in
confusion
they
rose
like
wild
laughter
twined
for
an
instant
round
some
lofty
knot
then
started
off
again
with
yet
more
sonorous
mirth
splotching
all
the
foliage
with
the
merry
ebriety
of
their
tendrils
their
pale
green
set
a
glow
of
bacchanalianism
about
the
heads
of
the
old
orchard
giants
then
towards
the
left
were
trees
less
thickly
planted
almonds
allowed
the
sun
s
rays
to
pass
and
ripen
the
pumpkins
which
looked
like
moons
that
had
fallen
to
the
earth
near
the
edge
of
a
stream
which
flowed
through
the
orchard
there
also
grew
various
kinds
of
melons
some
rough
with
knotty
warts
some
smooth
and
shining
as
oval
as
the
eggs
of
ostriches
at
every
step
too
progress
was
barred
by
currant
bushes
showing
limpid
bunches
of
fruit
rubies
in
one
and
all
of
which
there
sparkled
liquid
sunlight
and
hedges
of
raspberry
canes
shot
up
like
wild
brambles
while
the
ground
was
but
a
carpet
of
strawberry
plants
teeming
with
ripe
berries
which
exhaled
a
slight
odour
of
vanilla
but
the
enchanted
corner
of
the
orchard
was
still
further
to
the
left
near
a
tier
of
rocks
which
there
began
to
soar
upwards
there
you
found
yourself
in
a
veritable
land
of
fire
in
a
natural
on
which
the
sun
fell
freely
at
first
you
had
to
make
your
way
through
huge
ungainly
fig
trees
which
stretched
out
grey
branches
like
arms
weary
of
lying
still
and
whose
villose
foliage
was
so
dense
that
in
order
to
pass
one
constantly
had
to
snap
off
twigs
that
had
sprouted
from
the
old
wood
next
you
passed
on
through
groves
of
strawberry
trees
with
verdure
like
that
of
giant
and
with
scarlet
berries
which
suggested
maize
plants
decked
out
with
crimson
ribbon
then
there
came
a
jungle
of
medlars
and
jujube
trees
which
pomegranates
skirted
with
verdure
the
fruit
of
the
latter
big
as
a
child
s
fist
was
scarcely
set
as
yet
and
the
purple
blossoms
fluttering
at
the
ends
of
the
branches
looked
like
the
palpitating
wings
of
the
humming
birds
which
do
not
even
bend
the
shoots
on
which
they
perch
lastly
there
was
a
forest
of
orange
and
lemon
trees
growing
vigorously
in
the
open
air
their
straight
trunks
stood
like
rows
of
brown
columns
while
their
shiny
leaves
showed
brightly
against
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
cast
upon
the
ground
a
network
of
light
and
shadow
figuring
the
palms
of
some
indian
fabric
here
there
was
shade
beside
which
that
of
the
european
orchard
seemed
colourless
insipid
the
warm
joy
of
sunlight
softened
into
flying
the
glad
certainty
of
evergreen
foliage
the
penetrating
perfume
of
blossom
and
the
more
subdued
fragrance
of
fruit
all
helping
to
fill
the
body
with
the
soft
languor
of
tropical
lands
and
now
let
us
breakfast
cried
albine
clapping
her
hands
it
must
be
at
least
nine
o
clock
and
i
am
very
she
had
risen
from
the
ground
serge
confessed
that
he
too
would
find
some
food
acceptable
you
goose
she
said
you
didn
t
understand
then
that
i
brought
you
here
to
breakfast
we
sha
n
t
die
of
hunger
here
we
can
help
ourselves
to
all
there
they
went
along
under
the
trees
pushing
aside
the
branches
and
making
their
way
to
the
thickest
of
the
fruit
albine
who
went
first
turned
and
in
her
voice
asked
her
companion
what
do
you
like
best
pears
apricots
cherries
or
currants
i
warn
you
that
the
pears
are
still
green
but
they
are
very
nice
all
the
serge
decided
upon
having
cherries
and
albine
agreed
it
would
be
as
well
to
start
with
them
but
when
she
saw
him
foolishly
beginning
to
scramble
up
the
first
cherry
tree
he
found
she
made
him
go
on
for
another
ten
minutes
through
a
frightful
entanglement
of
branches
the
cherries
on
this
tree
she
said
were
small
and
good
for
nothing
those
on
that
were
sour
those
on
another
would
not
be
ripe
for
at
least
a
week
she
knew
all
the
trees
stop
climb
this
one
she
said
at
last
as
she
stopped
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
so
heavily
laden
with
fruit
that
clusters
of
it
hung
down
to
the
ground
like
strings
of
coral
beads
serge
settled
himself
comfortably
between
two
branches
and
began
his
breakfast
he
no
longer
paid
attention
to
albine
he
imagined
she
was
in
another
tree
a
few
yards
away
when
happening
to
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
ground
he
saw
her
calmly
lying
on
her
back
beneath
him
she
had
thrown
herself
there
and
without
troubling
herself
to
use
her
hands
was
plucking
with
her
teeth
the
cherries
which
dangled
over
her
mouth
when
she
saw
she
was
discovered
she
broke
out
into
a
peal
of
laughter
and
twisted
about
on
the
grass
like
a
fish
taken
from
the
water
and
finally
crawling
along
on
her
elbows
she
gradually
made
the
circuit
of
the
tree
snapping
up
the
plumpest
cherries
as
she
went
along
they
tickle
me
so
she
cried
see
there
s
a
beauty
just
fallen
on
my
neck
they
are
so
deliciously
fresh
and
juicy
they
get
into
my
ears
my
eyes
my
nose
everywhere
they
are
much
sweeter
down
here
than
up
ah
said
serge
laughing
you
say
that
because
you
daren
t
climb
she
remained
for
a
moment
silent
with
indignation
daren
t
i
she
stammered
then
having
gathered
up
her
skirts
she
tightly
grasped
the
tree
and
pulled
herself
up
the
trunk
with
a
single
effort
of
her
strong
wrists
and
afterwards
she
stepped
lightly
along
the
branches
scarcely
using
her
hands
to
steady
herself
she
had
all
the
agile
nimbleness
of
a
squirrel
and
made
her
way
onward
maintaining
her
equilibrium
only
by
the
swaying
poise
of
her
body
when
she
was
quite
aloft
at
the
end
of
a
frail
branch
which
shook
dangerously
beneath
her
weight
she
cried
now
you
see
whether
i
daren
t
come
down
at
once
implored
serge
full
of
alarm
for
her
i
beg
of
you
to
come
down
you
will
be
injuring
but
she
enjoying
her
triumph
began
to
mount
still
higher
she
crawled
along
to
the
extreme
end
of
a
branch
grasping
its
leaves
in
her
hands
to
maintain
her
hold
the
branch
will
break
cried
serge
thoroughly
frightened
let
it
break
she
answered
with
a
laugh
it
will
save
me
the
trouble
of
getting
and
the
branch
did
break
but
only
slowly
with
such
deliberation
that
as
it
gradually
settled
towards
the
ground
it
let
albine
slip
down
in
very
gentle
fashion
she
did
not
appear
in
the
least
degree
frightened
but
gave
herself
a
shake
and
said
that
was
really
nice
it
was
quite
like
being
in
a
serge
had
jumped
down
from
the
tree
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
as
he
stood
there
quite
pale
from
fright
she
laughed
at
him
one
tumbles
down
from
trees
every
day
she
exclaimed
but
there
is
never
any
harm
done
look
more
cheerful
you
great
stupid
stay
just
wet
your
finger
and
rub
it
upon
my
neck
i
have
scratched
serge
wetted
his
finger
and
touched
her
neck
with
it
there
i
am
all
right
again
now
she
cried
as
she
bounded
off
let
us
play
at
hide
and
seek
shall
we
she
was
the
first
to
hide
she
disappeared
and
presently
from
the
depths
of
the
greenery
which
she
alone
knew
and
where
serge
could
not
possibly
find
her
she
called
cuckoo
but
this
game
of
hide
and
seek
did
not
put
a
stop
to
the
onslaught
upon
the
fruit
trees
breakfasting
went
on
in
all
the
nooks
and
corners
where
the
two
big
children
sought
each
other
albine
while
gliding
beneath
the
branches
would
stretch
out
her
hand
to
pluck
a
green
pear
or
fill
her
skirt
with
apricots
then
in
some
of
her
she
would
come
upon
such
rich
discoveries
as
would
make
her
careless
of
the
game
content
to
sit
upon
the
ground
and
remain
eating
once
however
she
lost
sound
of
serge
s
movements
so
in
her
turn
she
set
about
seeking
him
and
she
was
surprised
almost
vexed
when
she
discovered
him
under
a
of
whose
existence
she
herself
had
been
ignorant
and
whose
ripe
fruit
had
a
delicious
musky
perfume
she
soundly
rated
him
did
he
want
to
eat
everything
himself
that
he
hadn
t
called
to
her
to
come
he
pretended
to
know
nothing
about
the
trees
but
he
evidently
had
a
very
keen
scent
to
be
able
to
find
all
the
good
things
she
was
especially
indignant
with
the
poor
tree
itself
a
stupid
tree
which
no
one
had
known
of
and
which
must
have
sprung
up
in
the
night
on
purpose
to
put
people
out
as
she
stood
there
pouting
refusing
to
pluck
a
single
plum
it
occurred
to
serge
to
shake
the
tree
violently
and
then
a
shower
a
regular
hail
of
plums
came
down
albine
standing
in
the
midst
of
the
downfall
received
plums
on
her
arms
plums
on
her
neck
plums
on
the
very
tip
of
her
nose
at
this
she
could
no
longer
restrain
her
laughter
she
stood
in
the
midst
of
the
deluge
crying
more
more
amused
as
she
was
by
the
round
fruit
which
fell
around
her
as
she
squatted
there
with
hands
and
mouth
open
and
eyes
closed
it
was
a
morning
of
childish
play
of
wild
gambols
in
the
paradou
albine
and
serge
spent
hours
scampering
up
and
down
shouting
and
sporting
with
each
other
their
thoughts
still
all
innocence
and
in
what
a
delicious
spot
they
found
themselves
depths
of
greenery
with
undiscoverable
paths
along
whose
windings
it
was
never
possible
to
be
serious
such
greedy
laughter
fell
from
the
very
hedges
in
this
happy
orchard
there
was
such
a
playful
straggling
of
bushes
such
fresh
and
appetising
shade
such
a
wealth
of
old
trees
laden
like
kindly
grandfathers
with
sweet
dainties
even
in
the
depths
of
the
recesses
green
with
moss
beneath
the
broken
trunks
which
compelled
them
to
creep
the
one
behind
the
other
in
the
narrow
leafy
alleys
the
young
folks
never
succumbed
to
the
perilous
reveries
of
silence
no
trouble
touched
them
in
that
happy
wood
and
when
they
had
grown
weary
of
the
and
the
and
the
they
ran
beneath
the
slender
eating
green
almonds
scarcely
yet
as
big
as
peas
hunting
for
strawberries
in
the
grassy
carpet
and
regretting
that
the
melons
were
not
already
ripe
albine
finished
by
running
as
fast
as
she
could
go
pursued
by
serge
who
was
unable
to
overtake
her
she
rushed
amongst
the
leaping
over
their
heavy
branches
and
pulling
off
the
leaves
to
throw
them
behind
her
in
her
companion
s
face
in
a
few
strides
she
had
cleared
the
clumps
of
arbutus
whose
red
berries
she
tasted
on
her
way
and
it
was
in
the
jungle
of
medlars
and
that
serge
lost
her
at
first
he
thought
she
was
hiding
behind
a
pomegranate
but
found
that
he
had
mistaken
two
clustering
blossoms
for
the
rosy
roundness
of
her
wrists
then
he
scoured
the
plantation
of
rejoicing
in
their
beauty
and
perfume
and
thinking
that
he
must
have
reached
the
abode
of
the
fairies
of
the
sun
in
the
midst
of
them
he
caught
sight
of
albine
who
not
believing
him
so
near
her
was
peering
inquisitively
into
the
green
depths
what
are
you
looking
for
he
cried
you
know
very
well
that
is
she
sprang
up
hastily
and
slightly
blushed
for
the
first
time
that
day
then
sitting
down
by
the
side
of
serge
she
told
him
of
the
fine
times
there
would
be
when
the
oranges
should
be
ripe
the
wood
would
then
be
all
golden
all
bright
with
those
round
stars
dotting
with
yellow
sparks
the
arching
green
when
at
last
they
really
set
off
homeward
she
halted
at
every
fruit
tree
and
filled
her
pockets
with
sour
pears
and
bitter
plums
saying
that
they
world
be
good
to
eat
on
their
way
they
would
prove
a
hundred
times
more
enjoyable
than
anything
they
had
tasted
before
serge
was
obliged
to
swallow
some
of
them
in
spite
of
the
grimaces
he
made
at
each
bite
and
eventually
they
found
themselves
indoors
again
tired
out
but
feeling
very
happy
x
a
week
later
there
was
another
expedition
to
the
park
they
had
planned
to
extend
their
rambles
beyond
the
orchard
striking
out
to
the
left
through
the
meadows
watered
by
the
four
streams
they
would
travel
several
miles
over
the
thick
grass
and
they
might
live
on
fish
if
they
happened
to
lose
themselves
i
will
take
my
knife
said
albine
holding
up
a
peasant
s
knife
she
crammed
all
kinds
of
things
into
her
pockets
string
bread
matches
a
small
bottle
of
wine
some
rags
a
comb
and
some
needles
serge
took
a
rug
but
by
the
time
they
had
passed
the
and
reached
the
ruins
of
the
chateau
he
found
it
such
an
encumbrance
that
he
hid
it
beneath
a
piece
of
fallen
wall
the
sun
was
hotter
than
before
albine
had
delayed
their
departure
by
her
extensive
preparations
thus
in
the
heat
of
the
morning
they
stepped
along
side
by
side
almost
quietly
they
actually
managed
to
take
twenty
paces
at
a
time
without
pushing
one
another
or
laughing
they
began
to
talk
i
never
can
wake
up
began
albine
i
slept
so
soundly
last
night
did
you
yes
indeed
very
soundly
replied
serge
what
does
it
mean
when
you
dream
of
a
bird
that
talks
to
you
the
girl
resumed
i
don
t
know
what
did
your
bird
say
to
you
oh
i
have
forgotten
but
it
said
all
kinds
of
things
and
many
of
them
sounded
very
comical
stop
look
at
that
big
poppy
over
there
you
sha
n
t
get
it
you
sha
n
t
get
it
and
then
she
sprang
forward
but
serge
thanks
to
his
long
legs
outstripped
her
and
plucked
the
poppy
which
he
waved
about
victoriously
she
stood
there
with
lips
compressed
saying
nothing
but
feeling
a
strong
inclination
to
cry
serge
threw
down
the
flower
nothing
else
occurred
to
him
then
to
make
his
peace
with
her
he
asked
would
you
like
me
to
carry
you
as
i
did
the
other
day
no
she
pouted
a
little
but
she
had
not
gone
another
thirty
steps
when
she
turned
round
smiling
a
bramble
had
caught
hold
of
her
dress
i
thought
it
was
you
who
were
treading
on
my
dress
purposely
it
won
t
let
me
go
come
and
unfasten
when
she
was
released
they
walked
on
again
side
by
side
very
quietly
albine
pretended
that
it
was
much
more
amusing
to
stroll
along
in
this
fashion
like
steady
folks
they
had
just
reached
the
meadows
far
away
in
front
of
them
stretched
grassy
expanses
scarce
broken
here
and
there
by
the
tender
foliage
of
willows
the
grass
looked
soft
and
downy
like
velvet
it
was
a
deep
green
subsiding
in
the
distance
into
lighter
tints
and
on
the
horizon
assuming
a
bright
yellow
glow
beneath
the
flaring
sun
the
clumps
of
willows
right
over
yonder
seemed
like
pure
gold
bathed
in
the
tremulous
brilliance
of
the
sunshine
dancing
dust
tipped
the
blades
of
grass
with
quivering
light
and
as
the
gentle
breezes
swept
over
the
free
expanse
reflections
appeared
on
the
caressed
and
quivering
herbage
in
the
nearer
fields
a
multitude
of
little
white
daisies
now
in
swarms
now
straggling
and
now
in
groups
like
holiday
makers
at
some
public
rejoicing
brightly
peopled
the
dark
grass
buttercups
showed
themselves
gay
like
little
brass
bells
which
the
touch
of
a
fly
s
wing
would
set
tinkling
here
and
there
big
lonely
poppies
raised
fiery
cups
and
others
gathered
together
further
away
spread
out
like
vats
purple
with
lees
of
wine
big
cornflowers
balanced
aloft
their
light
blue
caps
which
looked
as
if
they
would
fly
away
at
every
breath
of
air
then
under
foot
there
were
patches
of
woolly
and
fragrant
sheets
of
fescue
dog
and
meadow
grass
sainfoin
reared
its
long
fine
filaments
clover
unfurled
its
clear
green
leaves
plantains
brandished
forests
of
spears
lucerne
spread
out
in
soft
beds
of
green
satin
broidered
with
purple
flowers
and
all
these
were
seen
to
right
to
left
in
front
everywhere
rolling
over
the
level
soil
showing
like
the
mossy
surface
of
a
stagnant
sea
asleep
beneath
the
sky
which
ever
seemed
to
expand
here
and
there
in
the
vast
expanse
the
vegetation
was
of
a
limpid
blue
as
though
it
reflected
the
colour
of
the
heavens
albine
and
serge
stepped
along
over
the
with
the
grass
reaching
to
their
knees
it
was
like
wading
through
a
pool
now
and
then
indeed
they
found
themselves
caught
by
a
current
in
which
a
stream
of
bending
stalks
seemed
to
flow
away
between
their
legs
then
there
were
slumbering
lakes
basins
of
short
grass
which
scarcely
reached
their
ankles
as
they
walked
along
together
their
joy
found
expression
not
in
wild
gambols
as
in
the
orchard
a
week
before
but
rather
in
loitering
with
their
feet
caught
among
the
supple
arms
of
the
herbage
tasting
as
it
were
the
caresses
of
a
pure
stream
which
calmed
the
exuberance
of
their
youth
albine
turned
aside
and
slipped
into
a
lofty
patch
of
vegetation
which
reached
to
her
chin
only
her
head
appeared
for
a
moment
or
two
she
stood
there
in
silence
then
she
called
to
serge
come
here
it
is
just
like
a
bath
it
is
as
if
one
had
green
water
all
over
then
she
gave
a
jump
and
scampered
off
without
waiting
for
him
and
they
both
walked
along
the
margin
of
the
first
stream
which
barred
their
onward
course
it
was
a
shallow
tranquil
brook
between
banks
of
wild
cress
it
flowed
on
so
placidly
and
gently
that
its
surface
reflected
like
a
mirror
the
smallest
reed
that
grew
beside
it
albine
and
serge
followed
this
stream
whose
onward
motion
was
slower
than
their
own
for
a
long
time
before
they
came
across
a
tree
that
flung
a
long
shadow
upon
the
idle
waters
as
far
as
their
eyes
could
reach
they
saw
the
bare
brook
stretch
out
and
slumber
in
the
sunlight
like
a
blue
serpent
half
uncoiled
at
last
they
reached
a
clump
of
three
willows
two
had
their
roots
in
the
stream
the
third
was
set
a
little
backward
their
trunks
rotten
and
crumbling
with
age
were
crowned
with
the
bright
foliage
of
youth
the
shadow
they
cast
was
so
slight
as
scarcely
to
be
perceptible
upon
the
sunlit
bank
yet
here
the
water
which
both
above
and
below
was
so
unruffled
showed
a
transient
quiver
a
rippling
of
its
surface
as
though
it
were
surprised
to
find
even
this
light
veil
cast
over
it
between
the
three
willows
the
sloped
down
to
the
stream
and
some
crimson
poppies
had
sprung
up
in
the
crevices
of
the
decaying
old
trunks
the
foliage
of
the
willows
looked
like
a
tent
of
greenery
fixed
upon
three
stakes
by
the
water
s
edge
beside
a
rolling
prairie
this
is
the
place
cried
albine
this
is
the
place
and
she
glided
beneath
the
willows
serge
sat
down
by
her
side
his
feet
almost
in
the
water
he
glanced
round
him
and
murmured
you
know
everything
you
know
all
the
best
spots
one
might
almost
think
this
was
an
island
ten
feet
square
right
in
the
middle
of
the
yes
indeed
we
are
quite
at
home
she
replied
as
she
gleefully
drummed
the
grass
with
her
fists
it
is
altogether
our
own
and
we
are
going
to
do
everything
then
as
if
struck
by
a
brilliant
idea
she
sprang
towards
him
and
with
her
face
close
to
his
asked
him
joyously
will
you
be
my
husband
i
will
be
your
he
was
delighted
at
the
notion
and
replied
that
he
would
gladly
be
her
husband
laughing
even
more
loudly
than
she
had
done
herself
then
albine
suddenly
became
grave
and
assumed
the
anxious
air
of
a
housewife
you
know
she
said
that
it
is
i
who
will
have
to
give
the
orders
we
will
have
breakfast
as
soon
as
you
have
laid
the
she
gave
him
her
orders
in
an
imperious
fashion
he
had
to
stow
all
the
various
articles
which
she
extracted
from
her
pockets
into
a
hole
in
one
of
the
willows
which
bole
she
called
the
cupboard
the
rags
supplied
the
household
linen
while
the
comb
represented
the
toilette
necessaries
the
needles
and
string
were
to
be
used
for
mending
the
explorers
clothes
provision
for
the
inner
man
consisted
of
the
little
bottle
of
wine
and
a
few
crusts
which
she
had
saved
from
yesterday
she
had
to
be
sure
some
matches
by
the
aid
of
which
she
intended
to
cook
the
fish
they
were
going
to
catch
when
serge
had
finished
laying
the
table
the
bottle
of
wine
in
the
centre
and
three
crusts
grouped
round
it
he
hazarded
the
observation
that
the
fare
seemed
to
be
scanty
but
albine
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
feminine
superiority
and
wading
into
the
water
she
said
in
a
severe
tone
i
will
catch
the
fish
you
can
watch
for
half
an
hour
she
strenuously
exerted
herself
in
trying
to
catch
some
of
the
little
fishes
with
her
hands
she
had
gathered
up
her
petticoats
and
fastened
them
together
with
a
piece
of
string
and
she
advanced
quietly
into
the
water
taking
the
greatest
care
not
to
disturb
it
when
she
was
quite
close
to
some
tiny
fish
that
lay
lurking
between
a
couple
of
pebbles
she
thrust
down
her
bare
arm
made
a
wild
grasp
and
brought
her
hand
up
again
with
nothing
in
it
but
sand
and
gravel
serge
then
broke
out
into
noisy
laughter
which
brought
her
back
to
the
bank
indignant
she
told
him
that
he
had
no
business
to
laugh
at
her
but
he
ended
by
asking
how
are
we
going
to
cook
your
fish
when
you
have
caught
it
there
is
no
wood
that
put
the
finishing
touch
to
her
discouragement
however
the
fish
in
that
stream
didn
t
seem
to
be
good
for
much
so
she
came
out
of
the
water
and
ran
through
the
long
grass
to
get
her
feet
dry
see
she
suddenly
exclaimed
here
is
some
pimpernel
it
is
very
nice
now
we
shall
have
a
serge
was
ordered
to
gather
a
quantity
of
the
pimpernel
and
place
it
on
the
table
they
ate
it
with
their
crusts
albine
declared
that
it
was
much
better
than
nuts
she
assumed
the
position
of
mistress
of
the
establishment
and
cut
serge
s
bread
for
him
for
she
would
not
trust
him
with
the
knife
at
last
she
made
him
store
away
in
the
cupboard
the
few
drops
of
wine
that
remained
at
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
he
was
also
ordered
to
sweep
the
grass
then
albine
lay
down
at
full
length
we
are
going
to
sleep
now
you
know
you
must
lie
down
by
my
he
did
as
he
was
ordered
they
lay
there
stiffly
staring
into
the
air
and
saying
that
they
were
asleep
and
that
it
was
very
nice
after
a
while
however
they
drew
slightly
away
from
one
another
averting
their
heads
as
if
they
felt
some
discomfort
and
at
last
breaking
the
silence
which
had
fallen
between
them
serge
exclaimed
i
love
you
very
it
was
love
such
as
it
is
without
any
sensual
feeling
that
instinctive
love
which
wakens
in
the
bosom
of
a
little
man
ten
years
old
at
the
sight
of
some
the
spreading
around
them
all
open
and
free
dissipated
the
slight
fear
each
felt
of
the
other
they
knew
that
they
lay
there
seen
of
all
the
herbage
that
the
blue
sky
looked
down
upon
them
through
the
light
foliage
of
the
willows
and
the
thought
was
pleasant
to
them
the
willow
canopy
over
their
heads
was
a
mere
open
screen
the
shade
it
cast
was
so
imperceptible
that
it
wafted
to
them
none
of
the
languor
that
some
dim
coppice
might
have
done
from
the
horizon
came
a
healthy
breeze
fraught
with
all
the
freshness
of
the
grassy
sea
swelling
here
and
there
into
waves
of
flowers
while
at
their
feet
the
stream
childlike
as
they
were
flowed
idly
along
with
a
gentle
babbling
that
sounded
to
them
like
the
laughter
of
a
companion
ah
happy
solitude
so
tranquil
and
placid
immensity
wherein
the
little
patch
of
grass
serving
as
their
couch
took
the
semblance
of
an
infant
s
cradle
there
that
s
enough
said
albine
getting
up
we
ve
rested
long
serge
seemed
a
little
surprised
at
this
speedy
termination
of
their
sleep
he
stretched
out
his
arm
and
caught
hold
of
albine
as
though
to
draw
her
near
him
again
and
when
she
laughing
dropped
upon
her
knees
he
grasped
her
elbows
and
gazed
up
at
her
he
knew
not
to
what
impulse
he
was
yielding
but
when
she
had
freed
herself
and
again
had
risen
to
her
feet
he
buried
his
face
amongst
the
grass
where
she
had
lain
and
which
still
retained
the
warmth
of
her
body
yes
he
said
at
last
it
is
time
to
get
up
and
then
he
rose
from
the
ground
they
scoured
the
until
evening
began
to
fall
they
went
on
and
on
inspecting
their
garden
albine
walked
in
front
sniffing
like
a
young
dog
and
saying
nothing
but
she
was
ever
in
search
of
the
happy
glade
although
where
they
found
themselves
there
were
none
of
the
big
trees
of
which
her
thoughts
were
full
serge
meanwhile
indulged
in
all
kinds
of
clumsy
gallantry
he
rushed
forward
so
hastily
to
thrust
the
tall
herbage
aside
that
he
nearly
tripped
her
up
and
he
almost
tore
her
arm
from
her
body
as
he
tried
to
assist
her
over
the
brooks
their
joy
was
great
when
they
came
to
the
three
other
streams
the
first
flowed
over
a
bed
of
pebbles
between
two
rows
of
willows
so
closely
planted
that
they
had
to
grope
between
the
branches
with
the
risk
of
falling
into
some
deep
part
of
the
water
it
only
rose
to
serge
s
knees
however
and
having
caught
albine
in
his
arms
he
carried
her
to
the
opposite
bank
to
save
her
from
a
wetting
the
next
stream
flowed
black
with
shade
beneath
a
lofty
canopy
of
foliage
passing
languidly
onward
with
the
gentle
rustling
and
rippling
of
the
satin
train
of
some
lady
dreamily
sauntering
through
the
woodland
depths
it
was
a
deep
cold
and
rather
stream
but
a
fallen
tree
that
stretched
from
bank
to
bank
served
them
as
a
bridge
they
crossed
over
bestriding
the
tree
with
dangling
feet
at
first
amusing
themselves
by
stirring
the
water
which
looked
like
a
mirror
of
burnished
steel
but
then
suddenly
hastening
frightened
by
the
strange
eyes
which
opened
in
the
depths
of
the
sleepy
current
at
the
slightest
splash
but
it
was
the
last
stream
which
delayed
them
the
most
it
was
sportive
like
themselves
it
flowed
more
slowly
at
certain
bends
whence
it
started
off
again
with
merry
ripples
past
piles
of
big
stones
into
the
shelter
of
some
clump
of
trees
and
grew
calmer
once
more
it
exhibited
every
humour
as
it
sped
along
over
soft
sand
or
rocky
boulders
over
sparkling
pebbles
or
greasy
clay
where
leaping
frogs
made
yellow
puddles
albine
and
serge
dabbled
about
in
delight
and
even
walked
homewards
through
the
stream
in
preference
to
remaining
on
the
bank
at
every
little
island
that
divided
the
current
they
landed
they
conquered
the
savage
spot
or
rested
beneath
the
lofty
canes
and
reeds
which
seemed
to
grow
there
expressly
as
shelter
for
shipwrecked
adventurers
thus
they
made
a
delightful
progress
amused
by
the
changing
scenery
of
the
banks
enlivened
by
the
merry
humour
of
the
living
current
but
when
they
were
about
to
leave
the
river
serge
realised
that
albine
was
still
seeking
something
along
the
banks
on
the
island
even
among
the
plants
that
slept
on
the
surface
of
the
water
he
was
obliged
to
go
and
pull
her
from
the
midst
of
a
patch
of
whose
broad
leaves
set
around
her
limbs
he
said
nothing
but
shook
his
finger
at
her
and
at
last
they
went
home
walking
along
arm
in
arm
like
young
people
after
a
day
s
outing
they
looked
at
each
other
and
thought
one
another
handsomer
and
stronger
than
before
and
of
a
certainty
their
laughter
had
a
different
ring
from
that
with
which
it
had
sounded
in
the
morning
xi
are
we
never
going
out
again
asked
serge
some
days
later
and
when
he
saw
albine
shrug
her
shoulders
with
a
weary
air
he
added
in
a
teasing
kind
of
way
you
have
got
tired
of
looking
for
your
tree
then
they
joked
about
the
tree
all
day
and
made
fun
of
it
it
didn
t
exist
it
was
only
a
yet
they
both
spoke
of
it
with
a
slight
feeling
of
awe
and
on
the
morrow
they
settled
that
they
would
go
to
the
far
end
of
the
park
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
which
serge
had
not
yet
seen
albine
refused
to
take
anything
along
with
them
they
breakfasted
before
starting
and
did
not
set
off
till
late
the
heat
of
the
sun
which
was
then
great
brought
them
a
feeling
of
languor
and
they
sauntered
along
gently
side
by
side
seeking
every
patch
of
sheltering
shade
they
lingered
neither
in
the
garden
nor
the
orchard
through
which
they
had
to
pass
when
they
gained
the
shady
coolness
beneath
the
big
trees
they
dropped
into
a
still
slower
pace
and
without
a
word
but
with
a
deep
sigh
as
though
it
were
welcome
relief
to
escape
from
the
glare
of
day
they
pushed
on
into
the
forest
s
depths
and
when
they
had
nothing
but
cool
green
leaves
about
them
when
no
glimpse
of
the
sunlit
expanse
was
afforded
by
any
gap
in
the
foliage
they
looked
at
each
other
and
smiled
with
a
feeling
of
vague
uneasiness
how
nice
it
is
here
murmured
serge
albine
simply
nodded
her
head
a
choking
sensation
in
her
throat
prevented
her
from
speaking
their
arms
were
not
passed
as
usual
round
each
other
s
waist
but
swung
loosely
by
their
sides
they
walked
along
without
touching
each
other
and
with
their
heads
inclined
towards
the
ground
but
serge
suddenly
stopped
short
on
seeing
tears
trickle
down
albine
s
cheeks
and
mingle
with
the
smile
that
played
around
her
lips
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
exclaimed
are
you
in
pain
have
you
hurt
yourself
no
don
t
you
see
i
m
smiling
i
don
t
know
how
it
is
but
the
scent
of
all
these
trees
forces
tears
into
my
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
resumed
why
you
re
crying
too
you
see
you
can
t
help
yes
he
murmured
all
this
deep
shade
affects
one
it
seems
so
peaceful
so
mournful
here
that
one
feels
a
little
sad
but
you
must
tell
me
you
know
if
anything
makes
you
really
unhappy
i
have
not
done
anything
to
annoy
you
have
i
you
are
not
vexed
with
me
she
assured
him
that
she
was
not
she
was
quite
happy
she
said
then
why
are
you
not
enjoying
yourself
more
shall
we
have
a
race
oh
no
we
can
t
race
she
said
disdainfully
with
a
pout
and
when
he
went
on
to
suggest
other
amusements
such
as
or
gathering
strawberries
or
violets
she
replied
a
little
impatiently
we
are
too
big
for
that
sort
of
thing
it
is
childish
to
be
always
playing
doesn
t
it
please
you
better
to
walk
on
quietly
by
my
side
she
stepped
along
so
prettily
that
it
was
indeed
a
pleasure
to
hear
the
of
her
little
boots
on
the
hard
soil
of
the
path
never
before
had
he
paid
attention
to
the
rhythmic
motion
of
her
figure
the
sweep
of
her
skirts
that
followed
her
with
serpentine
motion
it
was
happiness
never
to
be
exhausted
to
see
her
thus
walking
sedately
by
his
side
for
he
was
ever
discovering
some
new
charm
in
the
lissom
suppleness
of
her
limbs
you
are
right
he
said
this
is
really
the
best
i
would
walk
by
your
side
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
you
wished
a
little
further
on
however
he
asked
her
if
she
were
not
tired
and
hinted
that
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
have
a
rest
himself
we
might
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
he
suggested
in
a
stammering
voice
no
she
replied
i
don
t
want
but
we
might
lie
down
you
know
as
we
did
in
the
meadows
the
other
day
we
should
be
quite
no
no
i
don
t
want
and
she
suddenly
sprang
aside
as
if
scared
by
the
masculine
arms
outstretched
towards
her
serge
called
her
a
big
stupid
and
tried
to
catch
her
but
at
the
light
touch
of
his
fingers
she
cried
out
with
such
an
expression
of
pain
that
he
drew
back
trembling
i
have
hurt
you
he
said
she
did
not
reply
for
a
moment
surprised
herself
at
her
cry
of
fear
and
already
smiling
at
her
own
alarm
no
leave
me
don
t
worry
me
and
she
added
in
a
grave
tone
though
she
tried
to
feign
jocularity
you
know
that
i
have
my
tree
to
look
then
serge
began
to
laugh
and
offered
to
help
her
in
her
search
he
conducted
himself
very
gently
in
order
that
he
might
not
again
alarm
her
for
he
saw
that
she
was
even
yet
trembling
though
she
had
resumed
her
slow
walk
beside
him
what
they
were
contemplating
was
forbidden
and
could
bring
them
no
luck
and
he
like
her
felt
a
delightful
awe
which
thrilled
him
at
each
repeated
sigh
of
the
forest
trees
the
perfume
of
the
foliage
the
soft
green
light
which
filtered
through
the
leaves
the
soughing
silence
of
the
undergrowth
filled
them
with
tremulous
excitement
as
though
the
next
turn
of
the
path
might
lead
them
to
some
perilous
happiness
and
for
hours
they
walked
on
under
the
cool
trees
they
retained
their
reserved
attitude
towards
each
other
and
scarcely
exchanged
a
word
though
they
never
left
each
other
s
side
but
went
together
through
the
darkest
greenery
of
the
forest
at
first
their
way
lay
through
a
jungle
of
saplings
with
trunks
no
thicker
than
a
child
s
wrist
they
had
to
push
them
aside
and
open
a
path
for
themselves
through
the
tender
shoots
which
threw
a
wavy
lacework
of
foliage
before
their
eyes
the
saplings
closed
up
again
behind
them
leaving
no
trace
of
their
passage
and
they
struggled
on
and
on
at
random
ignorant
of
where
they
might
be
and
leaving
nothing
behind
them
to
mark
their
progress
save
a
momentary
waving
of
shaken
boughs
albine
weary
of
being
unable
to
see
more
than
three
steps
in
front
of
her
was
delighted
when
they
at
last
found
themselves
free
of
this
jungle
whose
end
they
had
long
tried
to
discover
they
had
now
reached
a
little
clearing
whence
several
narrow
paths
fringed
with
green
hedges
struck
out
in
various
directions
twisting
hither
and
thither
intersecting
one
another
bending
and
stretching
in
the
most
capricious
fashion
albine
and
serge
rose
on
to
peep
over
the
hedges
but
they
were
in
no
haste
and
would
willingly
have
stayed
where
they
were
lost
in
the
mazy
windings
without
ever
getting
anywhere
if
they
had
not
seen
before
them
the
proud
lines
of
the
lofty
forest
trees
they
passed
at
last
beneath
their
shade
solemnly
and
with
a
touch
of
sacred
awe
as
when
one
enters
some
vaulted
cathedral
the
straight
trunks
of
the
mighty
trees
of
a
dingy
grey
like
discoloured
stone
towered
loftily
line
by
line
like
a
infinity
of
columns
naves
opened
far
away
with
lower
narrower
aisles
naves
strangely
bold
in
their
proportions
whose
supporting
pillars
were
very
slender
richly
caned
so
finely
chiselled
that
everywhere
they
allowed
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
heavens
a
religious
silence
reigned
beneath
the
giant
arches
the
ground
below
lay
hard
as
stone
in
its
austere
nakedness
not
a
blade
of
green
was
there
nought
but
a
ruddy
dust
of
dead
leaves
and
serge
and
albine
listened
to
their
ringing
footsteps
as
they
went
on
thrilled
by
the
majestic
solitude
of
this
temple
here
indeed
if
anywhere
must
be
the
tree
beneath
whose
shade
perfect
happiness
had
made
its
home
they
felt
that
it
was
nigh
such
was
the
delight
which
stole
through
them
amidst
the
dimness
of
those
mighty
arches
the
trees
seemed
to
be
creatures
of
kindliness
full
of
strength
and
silence
and
happy
restfulness
they
looked
at
them
one
by
one
and
they
loved
them
all
and
they
awaited
from
their
majestic
tranquillity
some
revelation
whereby
they
themselves
might
grow
expand
into
the
bliss
of
strong
and
perfect
life
the
maples
the
ashes
the
hornbeams
the
cornels
formed
a
nation
of
giants
a
multitude
full
of
proud
gentleness
who
lived
in
peace
knowing
that
the
fall
of
any
one
of
them
would
have
sufficed
to
wreck
a
whole
corner
of
the
forest
the
elms
displayed
colossal
bodies
and
limbs
full
of
sap
scarce
veiled
by
light
clusters
of
little
leaves
the
birches
and
the
alders
delicate
as
sylphs
swayed
their
slim
figures
in
the
breeze
to
which
they
surrendered
the
foliage
that
streamed
around
them
like
the
locks
of
goddesses
already
half
metamorphosed
into
trees
the
planes
shot
up
regularly
with
glossy
tattooed
bark
whence
scaly
fragments
fell
down
a
gentle
slope
descended
the
larches
resembling
a
band
of
barbarians
draped
in
of
woven
greenery
but
the
oaks
were
the
monarchs
of
all
the
mighty
oaks
whose
sturdy
trunks
thrust
out
conquering
arms
that
barred
the
sun
s
approach
from
all
around
them
trees
oft
thrown
back
in
postures
like
those
of
unconquered
wrestlers
with
scattered
limbs
that
alone
gave
birth
to
a
whole
forest
could
the
tree
which
serge
and
albine
sought
be
one
of
those
colossal
oaks
or
was
it
one
of
those
lovely
planes
or
one
of
those
pale
maidenly
birches
or
one
of
those
creaking
elms
albine
and
serge
still
plodded
on
unable
to
tell
completely
lost
amongst
the
crowding
trees
for
a
moment
they
thought
they
had
found
the
object
of
their
quest
in
the
midst
of
a
group
of
walnut
trees
from
whose
thick
foliage
fell
so
cold
a
shadow
that
they
shivered
beneath
it
further
on
they
felt
another
thrill
of
emotion
as
they
came
upon
a
little
wood
of
chestnut
trees
green
with
moss
and
thrusting
out
big
branches
on
which
one
might
have
built
an
aerial
village
but
further
still
albine
caught
sight
of
a
clearing
whither
they
both
ran
hastily
here
in
the
midst
of
a
carpet
of
fine
turf
a
locust
tree
had
set
a
very
toppling
of
greenery
a
foliaged
babel
whose
ruins
were
covered
with
the
strangest
vegetation
stones
sucked
up
from
the
ground
by
the
mounting
sap
still
remained
adhering
to
the
trunk
high
branches
bent
down
to
earth
again
and
taking
root
surrounded
the
parent
tree
with
lofty
arches
a
nation
of
new
trunks
which
ever
increased
and
multiplied
upon
the
bark
seared
with
bleeding
wounds
were
ripening
the
mere
effort
of
bearing
fruit
strained
the
old
monster
s
skin
until
it
split
the
young
folks
walked
slowly
round
it
passing
under
the
arched
branches
which
formed
as
it
were
the
streets
of
a
city
and
stared
at
the
gaping
cracks
of
the
naked
roots
then
they
went
off
for
they
had
not
felt
there
the
supernatural
happiness
they
sought
where
are
we
asked
serge
albine
did
not
know
she
had
never
before
come
to
this
part
of
the
park
they
were
now
in
a
grove
of
cytisus
and
acacias
from
whose
clustering
blossoms
fell
a
soft
almost
sugary
perfume
we
are
quite
lost
she
laughed
i
don
t
know
these
trees
at
but
the
garden
must
come
to
an
end
somewhere
said
serge
when
we
get
to
the
end
you
will
know
where
you
are
won
t
you
no
she
answered
waving
her
hands
afar
they
fell
into
silence
never
yet
had
the
vastness
of
the
park
filled
them
with
such
pleasure
they
joyed
at
knowing
that
they
were
alone
in
so
a
domain
that
even
they
themselves
could
not
reach
its
limits
well
we
are
lost
said
serge
gaily
then
humbly
drawing
near
her
he
inquired
you
are
not
afraid
are
you
oh
no
there
s
no
one
except
you
and
me
in
the
garden
what
could
i
be
afraid
of
the
walls
are
very
high
we
can
t
see
them
but
they
guard
us
you
serge
was
now
quite
close
to
her
and
he
murmured
but
a
little
time
ago
you
were
afraid
of
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
perfectly
calm
without
the
least
faltering
in
her
glance
you
hurt
me
she
replied
but
you
are
different
now
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
you
then
you
will
let
me
hold
you
like
this
we
will
go
back
under
the
yes
you
may
put
your
arm
around
me
it
makes
me
feel
happy
and
we
ll
walk
slowly
eh
so
that
we
may
not
find
our
way
again
too
he
had
passed
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
it
was
thus
that
they
sauntered
back
to
the
shade
of
the
great
forest
trees
under
whose
arching
vaults
they
slowly
went
with
love
awakening
within
them
albine
said
that
she
felt
a
little
tired
and
rested
her
head
on
serge
s
shoulder
the
fabulous
tree
was
now
forgotten
they
only
sought
to
draw
their
faces
nearer
together
that
they
might
smile
in
one
another
s
eyes
and
it
was
the
trees
the
maples
the
elms
the
oaks
with
their
soft
green
shade
that
whisperingly
suggested
to
them
the
first
words
of
love
i
love
you
said
serge
while
his
breath
stirred
the
golden
hair
that
clustered
round
albine
s
temples
he
tried
to
think
of
other
words
but
he
could
only
repeat
i
love
you
i
love
you
albine
listened
with
a
delightful
smile
upon
her
face
the
music
of
her
heart
was
in
accord
with
his
i
love
you
i
love
you
she
sighed
with
all
the
sweetness
of
her
soft
young
voice
then
lifting
up
her
blue
eyes
in
which
the
light
of
love
was
dawning
she
asked
how
do
you
love
me
serge
reflected
for
a
moment
the
forest
was
wrapped
in
solemn
quietude
the
lofty
naves
quivered
only
with
the
soft
footsteps
of
the
young
pair
i
love
you
beyond
everything
he
answered
you
are
more
beautiful
than
all
else
that
i
see
when
i
open
my
window
in
the
morning
when
i
look
at
you
i
want
nothing
more
if
i
could
have
you
only
i
should
be
perfectly
she
lowered
her
eyes
and
swayed
her
head
as
if
accompanying
a
strain
of
music
i
love
you
he
went
on
i
know
nothing
about
you
i
know
not
who
you
are
nor
whence
you
came
you
are
neither
my
mother
nor
my
sister
and
yet
i
love
you
to
a
point
that
i
have
given
you
my
whole
heart
and
kept
nought
of
it
for
others
listen
i
love
those
cheeks
of
yours
so
soft
and
satiny
i
love
your
mouth
with
its
breath
i
love
your
eyes
in
which
i
see
my
own
love
reflected
i
love
even
your
eyelashes
even
those
little
veins
which
blue
the
whiteness
of
your
temples
ah
yes
i
love
you
i
love
you
and
i
love
you
too
she
answered
you
are
strong
and
tall
and
handsome
i
love
you
for
a
moment
or
two
they
remained
silent
enraptured
it
seemed
to
them
that
soft
music
went
before
them
that
their
own
words
came
from
some
dulcet
orchestra
which
they
could
not
see
shorter
and
shorter
became
their
steps
as
they
leaned
one
towards
the
other
ever
threading
their
way
amidst
the
mighty
trees
afar
off
through
the
long
vista
of
the
colonnades
were
glimpses
of
waning
sunlight
showing
like
a
procession
of
maidens
entering
church
for
a
betrothal
ceremony
amid
the
low
strains
of
an
organ
and
why
do
you
love
me
asked
albine
again
he
only
smiled
and
did
not
answer
her
immediately
then
he
said
i
love
you
because
you
came
to
me
that
expresses
all
now
we
are
together
and
we
love
one
another
it
seems
to
me
that
i
could
not
go
on
living
if
i
did
not
love
you
you
are
the
very
breath
of
my
he
bent
his
head
speaking
almost
as
though
he
were
in
a
dream
one
does
not
know
all
that
at
first
it
grows
up
in
one
as
one
s
heart
grows
one
has
to
grow
one
has
to
get
strong
do
you
remember
how
we
loved
one
another
though
we
didn
t
speak
of
it
one
is
childish
and
silly
at
first
then
one
fine
day
it
all
becomes
clear
and
bursts
out
you
see
we
have
nothing
to
trouble
about
we
love
one
another
because
our
love
and
our
life
are
albine
s
head
was
cast
back
her
eyes
were
tightly
closed
and
she
scarce
drew
her
breath
serge
s
caressing
words
enraptured
her
do
you
really
really
love
me
she
murmured
without
opening
her
eyes
serge
remained
silent
sorely
troubled
that
he
could
find
nothing
further
to
say
to
prove
to
her
the
force
of
his
love
his
eyes
wandered
over
her
rosy
face
which
lay
upon
his
shoulder
with
the
restfulness
of
sleep
her
eyelids
were
soft
as
silk
her
moist
lips
were
curved
into
a
bewitching
smile
her
brow
was
pure
white
with
just
a
rim
of
gold
below
her
hair
he
would
have
liked
to
give
his
whole
being
with
the
word
which
seemed
to
be
upon
his
tongue
but
which
he
could
not
utter
again
he
bent
over
her
and
seemed
to
consider
on
what
sweet
spot
of
that
fair
face
he
should
whisper
the
supreme
syllables
but
he
said
nothing
he
only
breathed
a
little
sigh
then
he
kissed
albine
s
lips
albine
i
love
you
i
love
you
serge
then
they
stopped
short
thrilled
quivering
with
that
first
love
kiss
she
had
opened
her
eyes
quite
widely
he
was
standing
with
his
lips
protruding
slightly
towards
hers
they
looked
at
each
other
without
a
blush
they
felt
they
were
under
the
influence
of
some
sovereign
power
it
was
like
the
realisation
of
a
long
meeting
in
which
they
beheld
themselves
grown
made
one
for
the
other
for
ever
joined
for
a
moment
they
remained
wondering
raising
their
eyes
to
the
solemn
vault
of
greenery
above
them
questioning
the
tranquil
nation
of
trees
as
if
seeking
an
echo
of
their
kiss
but
beneath
the
serene
complacence
of
the
forest
they
yielded
to
prolonged
ringing
lovers
gaiety
full
of
all
the
tenderness
now
born
tell
me
how
long
you
have
loved
me
tell
me
everything
did
you
love
me
that
day
when
you
lay
sleeping
upon
my
hand
did
you
love
me
when
i
fell
out
of
the
cherry
tree
and
you
stood
beneath
it
stretching
out
your
arms
to
catch
me
and
looking
so
pale
did
you
love
me
when
you
took
hold
of
me
round
the
waist
in
the
meadows
to
help
me
over
the
streams
hush
let
me
speak
i
have
always
loved
you
and
you
did
you
love
me
did
you
until
the
evening
closed
round
them
they
lived
upon
that
one
word
love
in
which
they
ever
seemed
to
find
some
new
sweetness
they
brought
it
into
every
sentence
ejaculated
it
inconsequentially
merely
for
the
pleasure
they
found
in
pronouncing
it
serge
however
did
not
think
of
pressing
a
second
kiss
to
albine
s
lips
the
perfume
of
the
first
sufficed
them
in
their
purity
they
had
found
their
way
again
or
rather
had
stumbled
upon
it
for
they
had
paid
no
attention
to
the
paths
they
took
as
they
left
the
forest
twilight
had
fallen
and
the
moon
was
rising
round
and
yellow
between
the
black
foliage
it
was
a
delightful
walk
home
through
the
park
with
that
discreet
luminary
peering
at
them
through
the
gaps
in
the
big
trees
albine
said
that
the
moon
was
surely
following
them
the
night
was
balmy
warm
too
with
stars
far
away
a
long
murmur
rose
from
the
forest
trees
and
serge
listened
thinking
they
are
talking
of
when
they
reached
the
parterre
they
passed
through
an
atmosphere
of
sweetest
perfumes
the
perfume
of
flowers
at
night
which
is
richer
more
caressing
than
by
day
and
seems
like
the
very
breath
of
slumber
good
night
good
night
they
clasped
each
other
by
the
hand
on
the
landing
of
the
first
floor
without
entering
the
room
where
they
usually
wished
each
other
good
night
they
did
not
kiss
but
serge
when
he
was
alone
remained
seated
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
listening
to
albine
s
every
movement
in
the
room
above
he
was
weary
with
happiness
a
happiness
that
benumbed
his
limbs
xii
for
the
next
few
days
albine
and
serge
experienced
a
feeling
of
embarrassment
they
avoided
all
allusion
to
their
walk
beneath
the
trees
they
had
not
again
kissed
each
other
or
repeated
their
confession
of
love
it
was
not
any
feeling
of
shame
which
had
sealed
their
lips
but
rather
a
fear
of
in
any
way
spoiling
their
happiness
when
they
were
apart
they
lived
upon
the
dear
recollection
of
love
s
awakening
plunged
into
it
passed
once
more
through
the
happy
hours
which
they
had
spent
with
their
arms
around
each
other
s
waist
and
their
faces
close
together
it
all
ended
by
throwing
them
both
into
a
feverish
state
they
looked
at
each
other
with
heavy
eyes
and
talked
in
a
melancholy
mood
of
things
that
did
not
interest
them
in
the
least
then
after
a
long
interval
of
silence
serge
would
say
to
albine
in
a
tone
full
of
anxiety
you
are
ill
but
she
shook
her
head
as
she
answered
no
no
it
is
you
who
are
not
well
your
hands
are
the
thought
of
the
park
filled
them
with
vague
uneasiness
which
they
could
not
understand
they
felt
that
danger
lurked
for
them
in
some
and
would
seize
them
and
do
them
hurt
they
never
spoke
about
these
disquieting
thoughts
but
certain
timid
glances
revealed
to
them
the
mutual
anguish
which
held
them
apart
as
though
they
were
foes
one
morning
however
albine
ventured
after
much
hesitation
to
say
to
serge
it
is
wrong
of
you
to
keep
always
indoors
you
will
fall
ill
serge
laughed
in
rather
an
embarrassed
way
bah
he
muttered
we
have
been
everywhere
we
know
all
the
garden
by
but
albine
shook
her
head
and
in
a
whisper
replied
no
no
we
don
t
know
the
rocks
we
have
never
been
to
the
springs
it
was
there
that
i
warmed
myself
last
winter
there
are
some
nooks
where
the
stones
seem
to
be
actually
the
next
morning
without
having
said
another
word
on
the
subject
they
set
out
together
they
climbed
up
to
the
left
behind
the
grotto
where
the
marble
woman
lay
slumbering
and
as
they
set
foot
on
the
lowest
stones
serge
remarked
we
must
see
everything
perhaps
we
shall
feel
quieter
the
day
was
very
hot
there
was
thunder
in
the
air
they
had
not
ventured
to
clasp
each
other
s
waist
but
stepped
along
one
behind
the
other
glowing
beneath
the
sunlight
albine
took
advantage
of
a
widening
of
the
path
to
let
serge
go
on
in
front
for
the
warmth
of
his
breath
upon
her
neck
troubled
her
all
around
them
the
rocks
arose
in
broad
tiers
storeys
of
huge
flags
bristling
with
coarse
vegetation
they
first
came
upon
golden
gorse
clumps
of
sage
thyme
lavender
and
other
balsamic
plants
with
juniper
trees
and
bitter
rosemary
whose
strong
scent
made
them
dizzy
here
and
there
the
path
was
hemmed
in
by
holly
that
grew
in
quaint
forms
like
cunningly
wrought
metal
work
gratings
of
blackened
bronze
wrought
iron
and
polished
copper
elaborately
ornamented
covered
with
prickly
and
before
reaching
the
springs
they
had
to
pass
through
a
its
shadow
seemed
to
weigh
upon
their
shoulders
like
lead
the
dry
needles
crackled
beneath
their
feet
throwing
up
a
light
resinous
dust
which
burned
their
lips
your
garden
doesn
t
make
itself
very
agreeable
just
here
said
serge
turning
towards
albine
they
smiled
at
each
other
they
were
now
near
the
edge
of
the
springs
the
sight
of
the
clear
waters
brought
them
relief
yet
these
springs
did
not
hide
beneath
a
covering
of
verdure
like
those
that
bubble
up
on
the
plains
and
set
thick
foliage
growing
around
them
that
they
may
slumber
idly
in
the
shade
they
shot
up
in
the
full
light
of
day
from
a
cavity
in
the
rock
without
a
blade
of
grass
near
by
to
tinge
the
clear
water
with
green
steeped
in
the
sunshine
they
looked
silvery
in
their
depths
the
sun
beat
against
the
sand
in
a
breathing
living
dust
of
light
and
they
darted
out
of
their
basin
like
arms
of
purest
white
they
rebounded
like
nude
infants
at
play
and
then
suddenly
leapt
down
in
a
waterfall
whose
curve
suggested
a
woman
s
breast
dip
your
hands
in
cried
albine
the
water
is
icy
cold
at
the
they
were
indeed
able
to
refresh
their
hot
hands
they
threw
water
over
their
faces
too
and
lingered
there
amidst
the
spray
which
rose
up
from
the
streaming
springs
look
cried
albine
look
there
is
the
garden
and
there
are
the
meadows
and
the
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
the
paradou
spread
out
beneath
their
feet
and
you
see
she
added
there
isn
t
the
least
sign
of
any
wall
the
whole
country
belongs
to
us
right
up
to
the
by
this
time
almost
unawares
they
had
slipped
their
arms
round
each
other
s
waist
the
coolness
of
the
springs
had
soothed
their
feverish
disquietude
but
just
as
they
were
going
away
albine
seemed
to
recall
something
and
led
serge
back
again
saying
down
there
below
the
rocks
a
long
time
ago
i
once
saw
the
but
there
is
nothing
to
be
seen
replied
serge
turning
a
little
pale
yes
yes
it
must
be
behind
that
avenue
of
chestnut
trees
on
the
other
side
of
those
then
on
feeling
serge
s
arm
tremble
she
added
but
perhaps
i
am
mistaken
yet
i
seem
to
remember
that
i
suddenly
came
upon
it
as
i
left
the
avenue
it
stopped
my
way
and
was
so
high
that
i
felt
a
little
afraid
and
a
few
steps
farther
on
i
came
upon
another
surprise
there
was
a
huge
hole
in
it
through
which
i
could
see
the
whole
country
serge
looked
at
her
with
entreaty
in
his
eyes
she
gave
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
to
reassure
him
and
went
on
but
i
stopped
the
hole
up
i
have
told
you
that
we
are
quite
alone
and
we
are
i
stopped
it
up
at
once
i
had
my
knife
with
me
and
i
cut
down
some
brambles
and
rolled
up
some
big
stones
i
would
defy
even
a
sparrow
to
force
its
way
through
if
you
like
we
will
go
and
look
at
it
one
of
these
days
and
then
you
will
be
but
he
shook
his
head
then
they
went
away
together
still
holding
each
other
by
the
waist
but
they
had
grown
anxious
once
more
serge
gazed
down
askance
at
albine
s
face
and
she
felt
perturbed
beneath
his
glance
they
would
have
liked
to
go
down
again
at
once
and
thus
escape
the
uneasiness
of
a
longer
walk
but
in
spite
of
themselves
as
though
impelled
by
some
stronger
power
they
skirted
a
rocky
cliff
and
reached
a
where
once
more
they
found
the
intoxication
of
the
full
sunlight
they
no
longer
inhaled
the
soft
languid
perfumes
of
aromatic
plants
the
musky
scent
of
thyme
and
the
incense
of
lavender
now
they
were
treading
a
growth
under
foot
wormwood
with
bitter
penetrating
smell
rue
that
reeked
like
putrid
flesh
and
hot
valerian
clammy
with
aphrodisiacal
exudations
mandragoras
hemlocks
hellebores
dwales
poured
forth
their
odours
and
made
their
heads
swim
till
they
reeled
and
tottered
one
against
the
other
shall
i
hold
you
up
serge
asked
albine
as
he
felt
her
leaning
heavily
upon
him
he
was
already
pressing
her
in
his
arms
but
she
struggled
out
of
his
grasp
and
drew
a
long
breath
no
you
stifle
me
she
said
leave
me
alone
i
don
t
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
the
ground
seems
to
give
way
under
my
feet
it
is
there
i
feel
the
she
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
laid
it
upon
her
breast
then
serge
turned
quite
pale
he
was
even
more
overcome
than
she
and
both
had
tears
in
their
eyes
as
they
saw
each
other
thus
ill
and
troubled
unable
to
think
of
a
remedy
for
the
evil
which
had
fallen
upon
them
were
they
going
to
die
here
of
that
mysterious
suffocating
faintness
come
and
sit
down
in
the
shade
said
serge
it
is
these
plants
which
are
poisoning
us
with
their
noxious
he
led
her
gently
along
by
her
for
she
shivered
and
trembled
when
he
but
touched
her
wrist
it
was
beneath
a
fine
cedar
whose
level
branches
spread
nearly
a
dozen
yards
around
that
she
seated
herself
behind
grew
various
quaint
conifers
cypresses
with
soft
flat
foliage
that
looked
like
heavy
lace
spruce
firs
erect
and
solemn
like
ancient
druidical
pillars
still
black
with
the
blood
of
sacrificed
victims
yews
whose
dark
robes
were
fringed
with
silver
evergreen
trees
of
all
kinds
with
foliage
dark
leathery
verdure
splashed
here
and
there
with
yellow
and
red
there
was
a
araucaria
that
stood
out
strangely
with
large
regular
arms
resembling
reptiles
grafted
one
on
the
other
and
bristling
with
imbricated
leaves
that
suggested
the
scales
of
an
excited
serpent
in
this
heavy
shade
the
warm
air
lulled
one
to
voluptuous
drowsiness
the
atmosphere
slept
breathless
and
a
perfume
of
eastern
love
the
perfume
that
came
from
the
painted
lips
of
the
shunamite
was
exhaled
by
the
odorous
trees
are
you
not
going
to
sit
down
said
albine
and
she
slipped
a
little
aside
to
make
room
for
him
but
serge
stepped
back
and
remained
standing
then
as
she
renewed
her
request
he
dropped
upon
his
knees
a
little
distance
away
and
said
softly
no
i
am
more
feverish
even
than
you
are
i
should
make
you
hot
if
i
wasn
t
afraid
of
hurting
you
i
would
take
you
in
my
arms
and
clasp
you
so
tightly
that
we
should
no
longer
feel
any
he
dragged
himself
nearer
to
her
on
his
knees
oh
to
have
you
in
my
arms
in
the
night
i
awake
from
dreams
in
which
i
see
you
near
me
but
alas
you
are
ever
far
away
there
seems
to
be
some
wall
built
up
between
us
which
i
can
never
beat
down
and
yet
i
am
now
quite
strong
again
i
could
catch
you
up
in
my
arms
and
swing
you
over
my
shoulder
and
carry
you
off
as
though
you
belonged
to
he
had
let
himself
sink
upon
his
elbows
in
an
attitude
of
deep
adoration
and
he
breathed
a
kiss
upon
the
hem
of
albine
s
skirt
but
at
this
the
girl
sprang
up
as
though
it
was
she
herself
that
had
received
the
kiss
she
hid
her
brow
with
her
hands
perturbed
quivering
and
stammering
forth
don
t
don
t
i
beg
of
you
let
us
go
she
did
not
hurry
away
but
let
serge
follow
her
as
she
walked
slowly
on
stumbling
against
the
roots
of
the
plants
and
with
her
hands
still
clasped
round
her
head
as
though
to
check
the
excitement
that
thrilled
her
when
they
came
out
of
the
little
wood
they
took
a
few
steps
over
ledges
of
rocks
on
which
a
whole
nation
of
ardent
fleshy
plants
was
squatting
it
was
like
a
crawling
writhing
assemblage
of
hideous
nameless
monsters
such
as
people
a
nightmare
monsters
akin
to
spiders
caterpillars
and
grown
to
gigantic
proportions
some
with
bare
glaucous
skins
others
tufted
with
filthy
matted
hairs
whilst
many
had
sickly
limbs
dwarf
legs
and
shrivelled
palsied
arms
sprawling
around
them
and
some
displayed
horrid
dropsical
bellies
some
had
spines
bossy
with
hideous
humps
and
others
looked
like
dislocated
skeletons
mamillaria
threw
up
living
pustules
a
crawling
swarm
of
greenish
tortoises
bristling
hideously
with
long
hairs
that
were
stiffer
than
iron
the
echinocacti
which
showed
more
flesh
suggested
nests
of
young
writhing
knotted
vipers
the
echinopses
were
mere
excrescent
growths
that
made
one
think
of
huge
insects
rolled
into
balls
the
spread
out
fleshy
leaves
spotted
with
ruddy
spikes
that
resembled
swarms
of
microscopic
bees
the
gasterias
sprawled
about
like
big
turned
over
on
their
backs
with
and
striated
legs
the
cacti
of
the
cereus
family
showed
a
horrid
vegetation
huge
polyps
the
diseases
of
an
overheated
soil
the
maladies
of
poisoned
sap
but
the
aloes
languidly
unfolding
their
hearts
were
particularly
numerous
and
conspicuous
among
them
one
found
every
possible
tint
of
green
pale
green
and
vivid
yellowish
green
and
greyish
browny
green
dashed
with
a
ruddy
tone
and
deep
green
fringed
with
pale
gold
and
the
shapes
of
their
leaves
were
as
varied
as
their
tints
some
were
broad
and
others
were
long
and
narrow
like
some
bristled
with
spikey
thorns
while
yet
others
looked
as
though
they
had
been
cunningly
hemmed
at
the
edges
there
were
giant
ones
in
lonely
majesty
with
flower
stalks
that
towered
up
aloft
like
poles
wreathed
with
rosy
coral
and
there
were
tiny
ones
clustering
thickly
together
on
one
and
the
same
stem
and
throwing
forth
on
all
sides
leaves
that
gleamed
and
quivered
like
adders
tongues
let
us
go
back
to
the
shade
begged
serge
you
can
sit
down
there
as
you
did
just
now
and
i
will
lie
at
your
feet
and
talk
to
where
they
stood
the
sun
rays
fell
like
torrential
rain
it
was
as
if
the
triumphant
orb
seized
upon
the
shadowless
ground
and
strained
it
to
his
blazing
breast
albine
grew
faint
staggered
and
turned
to
serge
for
support
but
the
moment
they
felt
each
other
s
touch
they
fell
together
without
even
a
word
it
was
as
though
the
very
rock
beneath
them
had
opened
as
though
they
were
ever
going
down
and
down
their
hands
sought
each
other
caressingly
embracingly
but
such
keen
anguish
did
they
experience
that
they
suddenly
tore
themselves
apart
and
fled
each
in
a
different
direction
serge
did
not
cease
running
till
he
had
reached
the
pavilion
and
had
thrown
himself
upon
his
bed
his
brain
on
fire
and
despair
in
his
heart
albine
did
not
return
till
nightfall
after
hours
of
weeping
in
a
corner
of
the
garden
it
was
the
first
time
that
they
had
not
returned
home
together
tired
after
their
long
wanderings
for
three
days
they
kept
apart
feeling
terribly
unhappy
xiii
yet
now
the
park
was
entirely
their
own
they
had
taken
sovereign
possession
of
it
there
was
not
a
corner
of
it
that
was
not
theirs
to
use
as
they
willed
for
them
alone
the
thickets
of
roses
put
forth
their
blossoms
and
the
parterre
exhaled
its
soft
perfume
which
lulled
them
to
sleep
as
they
lay
at
night
with
their
windows
open
the
orchard
provided
them
with
food
filling
albine
s
skirts
with
fruits
and
spread
over
them
the
shade
of
its
perfumed
boughs
under
which
it
was
so
pleasant
to
breakfast
in
the
early
morning
away
in
the
meadows
the
grass
and
the
streams
were
all
theirs
the
grass
which
extended
their
kingdom
to
such
boundless
distance
spreading
an
endless
silky
carpet
before
them
and
the
streams
which
were
the
best
of
their
joys
emblematic
of
their
own
purity
and
innocence
ever
offering
them
coolness
and
freshness
in
which
they
delighted
to
bathe
their
youth
the
forest
too
was
entirely
theirs
from
the
mighty
oaks
which
ten
men
could
not
have
spanned
to
the
slim
birches
which
a
child
might
have
snapped
the
forest
with
all
its
trees
all
its
shade
all
its
avenues
and
clearings
its
cavities
of
greenery
of
which
the
very
birds
themselves
were
ignorant
the
forest
which
they
used
as
they
listed
as
if
it
were
a
giant
canopy
beneath
which
they
might
shelter
from
the
noontide
heat
their
love
they
reigned
everywhere
even
among
the
rocks
and
the
springs
even
over
that
gruesome
stretch
of
ground
that
teemed
with
such
hideous
growth
and
which
had
seemed
to
sink
and
give
way
beneath
their
feet
but
which
they
loved
yet
even
more
than
the
soft
grassy
couches
of
the
garden
for
the
strange
thrill
of
passion
they
had
felt
there
thus
now
in
front
of
them
behind
them
to
the
right
of
them
and
to
the
left
all
was
theirs
they
had
gained
possession
of
the
whole
domain
and
they
walked
through
a
friendly
expanse
which
knew
them
and
smiled
kindly
greetings
to
them
as
they
passed
devoting
itself
to
their
pleasure
like
a
faithful
and
submissive
servitor
the
sky
with
its
vast
canopy
of
blue
overhead
was
also
theirs
to
enjoy
the
park
walls
could
not
enclose
it
their
eyes
could
ever
revel
in
its
beauty
and
it
entered
into
the
joy
of
their
life
at
daytime
with
its
triumphal
sun
at
night
with
its
golden
rain
of
stars
at
every
moment
of
the
day
it
delighted
them
afresh
its
expression
ever
varying
in
the
early
morning
it
was
pale
as
a
maiden
just
risen
from
her
slumber
at
noon
it
was
flushed
radiant
as
with
a
longing
for
fruitfulness
and
in
the
evening
it
became
languid
and
breathless
as
after
keen
enjoyment
its
countenance
was
constantly
changing
particularly
in
the
evenings
at
the
hour
of
parting
did
it
delight
them
the
sun
hastening
towards
the
horizon
ever
found
a
fresh
smile
sometimes
he
disappeared
in
the
midst
of
serene
calmness
unflecked
by
a
single
cloud
sinking
gradually
beneath
a
golden
sea
at
other
times
he
threw
out
crimson
glories
tore
his
vaporous
robe
to
shreds
and
set
amidst
wavy
flames
that
streaked
the
skies
like
the
tails
of
gigantic
comets
whose
radiant
heads
lit
up
the
crests
of
the
forest
trees
then
again
extinguishing
his
rays
one
by
one
he
would
softly
sink
to
rest
on
shores
of
ruddy
sand
banks
of
blushing
coral
and
then
some
other
night
he
would
glide
away
demurely
behind
a
heavy
cloud
that
figured
the
grey
hangings
of
some
alcove
through
which
the
eye
could
only
detect
a
spark
like
that
of
a
or
else
he
would
rush
to
his
couch
in
a
tumult
of
passion
rolled
round
with
white
forms
which
gradually
crimsoned
beneath
his
fiery
embraces
and
finally
disappeared
with
him
below
the
horizon
in
a
confused
chaos
of
gleaming
struggling
limbs
it
was
only
the
plants
which
had
not
made
their
submission
albine
and
serge
passed
like
monarchs
through
the
kingdom
of
animals
who
rendered
them
humble
and
loyal
obeisance
when
they
crossed
the
parterre
flights
of
butterflies
arose
to
delight
their
eyes
to
fan
them
with
quivering
wings
and
to
follow
in
their
train
like
living
sunbeams
or
flying
blossoms
in
the
orchard
they
were
greeted
by
the
birds
that
banqueted
in
the
the
sparrows
the
chaffinches
the
golden
orioles
the
bullfinches
showed
them
the
ripest
fruit
scarred
by
their
hungry
beaks
and
while
they
sat
astride
the
branches
and
breakfasted
birds
twittered
and
sported
round
them
like
children
at
play
and
even
purloined
the
fruit
beneath
their
very
feet
albine
found
even
more
amusement
in
the
meadows
where
she
caught
the
little
green
frogs
with
eyes
of
gold
that
lay
squatting
amongst
the
reeds
absorbed
in
contemplation
while
serge
with
a
piece
of
straw
poked
the
crickets
out
of
their
or
tickled
the
grasshoppers
to
make
them
sing
he
picked
up
insects
of
all
colours
blue
ones
red
ones
yellow
ones
and
set
them
creeping
upon
his
sleeve
where
they
gleamed
and
glittered
like
buttons
of
sapphire
and
ruby
and
topaz
then
there
was
all
the
mysterious
life
of
the
streams
the
fishes
that
threaded
the
dim
waters
the
eels
whose
presence
was
betrayed
by
a
slight
quivering
of
the
the
young
fry
which
dispersed
like
blackish
sand
at
the
slightest
sound
the
flies
and
the
that
ruffled
into
circling
silvery
ripples
the
stagnant
surface
of
the
pools
all
that
silent
teeming
life
which
drew
them
to
the
water
and
impelled
them
to
dabble
and
stand
in
it
so
that
they
might
feel
those
millions
of
existences
ever
and
ever
gliding
past
their
limbs
at
other
times
when
the
day
was
hot
and
languid
they
would
betake
themselves
beneath
the
voiceful
shade
of
the
forest
and
listen
to
the
serenades
of
their
musicians
the
clear
fluting
of
the
nightingales
the
silvery
of
the
tomtits
and
the
accompaniment
of
the
cuckoos
they
gazed
with
delight
upon
the
swift
flight
of
the
pheasants
whose
plumes
gleamed
like
sudden
sun
rays
amidst
the
branches
and
with
a
smile
they
stayed
their
steps
to
let
a
troop
of
young
roebucks
bound
past
or
else
a
couple
of
grave
stags
that
slackened
their
pace
to
look
at
them
again
on
other
days
they
would
climb
up
amongst
the
rocks
when
the
sun
was
blazing
in
the
heavens
and
find
a
pleasure
in
watching
the
swarms
of
grasshoppers
which
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
arose
with
a
great
crepitation
of
wings
from
the
beds
of
thyme
the
snakes
that
lay
uncoiled
beneath
the
parched
bushes
or
the
lizards
that
sprawled
over
the
stones
watched
them
with
friendly
eyes
of
all
the
life
that
thus
teemed
round
them
in
the
park
albine
and
serge
had
only
become
really
conscious
since
the
day
when
a
kiss
had
awakened
them
to
life
themselves
now
it
deafened
them
at
times
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
language
which
they
did
not
understand
it
was
that
life
all
the
voices
of
the
animal
creation
all
the
perfumes
and
soft
shadows
of
the
flowers
and
trees
which
perturbed
them
to
such
a
point
as
to
make
them
angry
with
one
another
and
yet
throughout
the
whole
park
they
found
nothing
but
loving
familiarity
every
plant
and
every
creature
was
their
friend
all
the
paradou
was
one
great
caress
before
they
had
come
thither
the
sun
had
for
a
whole
century
reigned
over
it
in
lonely
majesty
the
garden
then
had
known
no
other
master
it
had
beheld
him
every
morning
scaling
the
boundary
wall
with
his
slanting
rays
at
noontide
it
had
seen
him
pour
his
vertical
heat
upon
the
panting
soil
and
at
evening
it
had
seen
him
go
off
on
the
other
side
with
a
kiss
of
farewell
upon
its
foliage
and
so
the
garden
had
no
shyness
it
welcomed
albine
and
serge
as
it
had
so
long
welcomed
the
sun
as
pleasant
companions
with
whom
one
puts
on
no
ceremony
the
animals
the
trees
the
streams
the
rocks
all
continued
in
an
unrestrained
state
of
nature
speaking
aloud
living
openly
without
a
secret
displaying
the
innocent
shamelessness
the
hearty
tenderness
of
the
world
s
first
days
serge
and
albine
however
suffered
from
these
voluptuous
surroundings
and
at
times
felt
minded
to
curse
the
garden
on
the
afternoon
when
albine
had
wept
so
bitterly
after
their
saunter
amongst
the
rocks
she
had
called
out
to
the
paradou
whose
intensity
of
life
and
passion
filled
her
with
distress
if
you
really
be
our
friend
why
why
do
you
make
us
so
wretched
xiv
the
next
morning
serge
barricaded
himself
in
his
room
the
perfume
from
the
garden
irritated
him
he
drew
the
calico
curtains
closely
across
the
window
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
the
park
perhaps
he
thought
he
might
recover
all
his
old
serenity
and
calm
if
he
shut
himself
off
from
that
greenery
whose
shade
sent
such
passionate
thrills
quivering
through
him
during
the
long
hours
they
spent
together
albine
and
he
never
now
spoke
of
the
rocks
or
the
streams
the
trees
or
the
sky
the
paradou
might
no
longer
have
been
in
existence
they
strove
to
forget
it
and
yet
they
were
all
the
time
conscious
of
its
presence
on
the
other
side
of
those
slight
curtains
scented
breezes
forced
their
way
in
through
the
interstices
of
the
window
frame
the
many
voices
of
nature
made
the
panes
resound
all
the
life
of
the
park
laughed
chattered
and
whispered
in
ambush
beneath
their
window
as
it
reached
them
their
cheeks
would
pale
and
they
would
raise
their
voices
seeking
some
occupation
which
might
prevent
them
from
hearing
it
have
you
noticed
said
serge
one
morning
during
these
uneasy
intervals
there
is
a
painting
of
a
woman
over
the
door
there
she
is
like
he
laughed
noisily
as
he
finished
speaking
they
both
turned
to
the
paintings
and
dragged
the
table
once
more
alongside
the
wall
with
a
nervous
desire
to
occupy
themselves
oh
no
murmured
albine
she
is
much
fatter
than
i
am
but
one
can
t
see
her
very
well
her
position
is
so
they
relapsed
into
silence
from
the
decayed
faded
painting
a
scene
which
they
had
never
before
noticed
now
showed
forth
it
was
as
if
the
picture
had
taken
shape
and
substance
again
beneath
the
influence
of
the
summer
heat
you
could
sea
a
nymph
with
arms
thrown
back
and
pliant
figure
on
a
bed
of
flowers
which
had
been
strewn
for
her
by
young
cupids
who
sickle
in
hand
ever
added
fresh
blossoms
to
her
rosy
couch
and
nearer
you
could
also
see
a
faun
who
had
surprised
her
thus
but
albine
repeated
no
she
is
not
like
me
she
is
very
serge
said
nothing
he
looked
at
the
girl
and
then
at
albine
as
though
he
were
comparing
them
one
with
the
other
albine
pulled
up
one
of
her
sleeves
as
if
to
show
that
her
arm
was
whiter
than
that
of
the
pictured
girl
then
they
subsided
into
silence
again
and
gazed
at
the
painting
and
for
a
moment
albine
s
large
blue
eyes
turned
to
serge
s
grey
ones
which
were
glowing
you
have
got
all
the
room
painted
again
then
she
cried
as
she
sprang
from
the
table
these
people
look
as
though
they
were
all
coming
to
life
they
began
to
laugh
but
there
was
a
nervous
ring
about
their
merriment
as
they
glanced
at
the
nude
and
frisking
cupids
which
started
to
life
again
on
all
the
panels
they
no
longer
took
those
survivals
of
voluptuous
eighteenth
century
art
to
represent
mere
children
at
play
they
were
disturbed
by
the
sight
of
them
and
as
albine
felt
serge
s
hot
breath
on
her
neck
she
started
and
left
his
side
to
seat
herself
on
the
sofa
they
frighten
me
she
murmured
the
men
are
like
robbers
and
the
women
with
their
dying
eyes
look
like
people
who
are
being
serge
sat
down
in
a
chair
a
little
distance
away
and
began
to
talk
of
other
matters
but
they
remained
uneasy
they
seemed
to
think
that
all
those
painted
figures
were
gazing
at
them
it
was
as
if
the
trooping
cupids
were
springing
out
of
the
panelling
casting
the
flowers
they
held
around
them
and
threatening
to
bind
them
together
with
the
blue
ribbons
which
already
enchained
two
lovers
in
one
corner
of
the
ceiling
and
the
whole
story
of
the
nymph
and
her
faun
lover
from
his
first
peep
at
her
to
his
triumph
among
the
flowers
seemed
to
burst
into
warm
life
were
all
those
lovers
all
those
impudent
shameless
cupids
about
to
step
down
from
their
panels
and
crowd
around
them
they
already
seemed
to
hear
their
panting
sighs
and
to
feel
their
breath
filling
the
spacious
room
with
the
perfume
of
voluptuousness
it
s
quite
suffocating
isn
t
it
sighed
albine
in
spite
of
every
airing
i
have
given
it
the
room
has
always
seemed
close
to
me
the
other
night
said
serge
i
was
awakened
by
such
a
penetrating
perfume
that
i
called
out
to
you
thinking
you
had
come
into
the
room
it
was
just
like
the
soft
warmth
of
your
hair
when
you
have
decked
it
with
heliotropes
in
the
earlier
times
it
seemed
to
be
wafted
to
me
from
a
distance
it
was
like
the
lingering
memory
of
a
perfume
but
now
i
can
t
sleep
for
it
and
it
is
so
strong
and
penetrating
that
it
quite
stupefies
me
the
alcove
grows
so
hot
too
at
night
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
lie
on
the
albine
laid
her
fingers
on
her
lips
and
whispered
it
is
the
dead
girl
she
who
once
lived
they
sniffed
the
odorous
air
with
forced
gaiety
but
in
reality
feeling
very
troubled
certainly
never
before
had
the
room
exhaled
such
a
disquieting
aroma
the
very
walls
seemed
to
be
still
echoing
the
faint
rustling
of
perfumed
skirts
and
the
floor
had
retained
the
fragrance
of
satin
slippers
dropped
by
the
bedside
and
near
the
head
of
the
bed
itself
serge
thought
he
could
trace
the
imprint
of
a
little
hand
which
had
left
behind
it
a
clinging
scent
of
violets
over
all
the
furniture
the
phantom
presence
of
the
dead
girl
still
lingered
fragrantly
see
this
is
the
armchair
where
she
used
to
sit
cried
albine
there
is
the
scent
of
her
shoulders
at
the
back
of
it
she
sat
down
in
it
herself
and
bade
serge
drop
upon
his
knees
and
kiss
her
hand
you
remember
the
day
when
i
first
let
you
in
and
said
good
morrow
my
dear
lord
but
that
wasn
t
all
was
it
he
kissed
her
hands
when
the
door
was
closed
there
they
are
my
hands
they
are
then
they
tried
to
resume
their
old
frolics
in
order
that
they
might
forget
the
paradou
whose
joyous
murmur
they
heard
ever
rising
outside
and
that
they
might
no
longer
think
of
the
pictures
nor
yield
to
the
influence
of
the
room
albine
put
on
an
affected
manner
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
finally
laughed
at
the
foolish
figure
which
serge
made
at
her
feet
you
stupid
she
said
take
me
round
the
waist
and
say
pretty
things
to
me
since
you
are
supposed
to
be
in
love
with
me
don
t
you
know
how
to
make
love
then
but
as
soon
as
she
felt
him
clasp
her
with
eager
impetuosity
she
began
to
struggle
and
freed
herself
from
his
embrace
no
no
leave
me
alone
i
can
t
bear
it
i
feel
as
though
i
were
choking
in
this
from
that
day
forward
they
felt
the
same
kind
of
fear
for
the
room
as
they
already
felt
for
the
garden
their
one
remaining
harbour
of
refuge
was
now
a
place
to
be
shunned
and
dreaded
a
spot
where
they
could
no
longer
find
themselves
together
without
watching
each
other
furtively
albine
now
scarcely
ventured
to
enter
it
but
remained
near
the
threshold
with
the
door
wide
open
behind
her
so
as
to
afford
her
an
immediate
retreat
serge
lived
there
in
solitude
a
prey
to
sickening
restlessness
lying
on
the
couch
and
vainly
trying
to
close
his
ears
to
the
sighs
of
the
soughing
park
and
his
nostrils
to
the
haunting
fragrance
of
the
old
furniture
at
night
he
dreamt
wild
passionate
dreams
which
left
him
in
the
morning
nervous
and
disquieted
he
believed
that
he
was
falling
ill
again
that
he
would
never
recover
plenitude
of
health
for
days
and
days
he
remained
there
in
silence
with
dark
rings
round
his
sleepy
eyes
only
starting
into
wakefulness
when
albine
came
to
visit
him
they
would
remain
face
to
face
gazing
at
one
another
sadly
and
uttering
but
a
few
soft
words
which
seemed
to
choke
them
albine
s
eyes
were
even
darker
than
serge
s
and
were
filled
with
an
imploring
gaze
then
after
a
week
had
gone
by
albine
s
visit
never
lasted
more
than
a
few
minutes
she
seemed
to
shun
him
when
she
came
to
the
room
she
appeared
thoughtful
remained
standing
and
hurried
off
as
soon
as
possible
when
he
questioned
her
about
this
change
in
her
demeanour
towards
him
and
reproached
her
for
no
longer
being
friendly
she
turned
her
head
away
and
avoided
replying
he
never
could
get
her
to
tell
him
how
she
spent
the
mornings
that
she
passed
alone
she
would
only
shake
her
head
and
talk
about
being
very
idle
if
he
pressed
her
more
closely
she
bounded
out
of
the
room
just
wishing
him
a
hasty
as
she
disappeared
through
the
doorway
he
often
noticed
however
that
she
had
been
crying
he
observed
too
in
her
expression
the
phases
of
a
hope
that
was
never
fulfilled
the
perpetual
struggling
of
a
desire
eager
to
be
satisfied
sometimes
she
seemed
quite
overwhelmed
with
melancholy
dragging
herself
about
with
an
air
of
utter
discouragement
like
one
who
no
longer
had
any
pleasure
in
living
at
other
times
she
laughed
lightly
her
face
shone
with
an
expression
of
triumphant
hope
of
which
however
she
would
not
yet
speak
and
her
feet
could
not
remain
still
so
eager
was
she
to
dart
away
to
what
seemed
to
her
some
last
certainty
but
on
the
following
day
she
would
sink
again
into
desperation
to
soar
afresh
on
the
morrow
on
the
pinions
of
renewed
hope
one
thing
which
she
could
not
conceal
from
serge
was
that
she
suffered
from
extreme
lassitude
even
during
the
few
moments
they
spent
together
she
could
not
prevent
her
head
from
nodding
or
keep
herself
from
dozing
off
serge
recognising
that
she
was
unwilling
to
reply
had
ceased
to
question
her
and
when
she
now
entered
his
room
he
contented
himself
with
casting
an
anxious
glance
at
her
fearful
lest
some
evening
she
should
no
longer
have
strength
enough
to
come
to
him
where
could
she
thus
reduce
herself
to
such
exhaustion
what
perpetual
struggle
was
it
that
brought
about
those
alternations
of
joy
and
despair
one
morning
he
started
at
the
sound
of
a
light
footfall
beneath
his
window
it
could
not
be
a
roe
venturing
abroad
in
that
manner
moreover
he
could
recognise
that
light
footfall
albine
was
wandering
about
the
paradou
without
him
it
was
from
the
paradou
that
she
returned
to
him
with
all
those
hopes
and
fears
and
inward
wrestlings
all
that
lassitude
which
was
killing
her
and
he
could
well
guess
what
she
was
seeking
out
there
alone
in
the
woody
depths
with
all
the
silent
obstinacy
of
a
woman
who
has
vowed
to
effect
her
purpose
after
that
he
used
to
listen
for
her
steps
he
dared
not
draw
aside
the
curtain
and
watch
her
as
she
hurried
along
through
the
trees
but
he
experienced
strange
almost
painful
emotion
in
listening
to
ascertain
what
direction
she
took
whether
she
turned
to
right
or
to
left
whether
she
went
straight
on
through
the
and
how
far
her
ramble
extended
amidst
all
the
noisy
life
of
the
paradou
amidst
the
soughing
chorus
of
the
trees
the
rustling
of
the
streams
and
the
ceaseless
songs
of
the
birds
he
could
distinguish
the
gentle
of
her
shoes
so
plainly
that
he
could
have
told
whether
she
was
stepping
over
the
gravel
near
the
rivers
the
crumbling
mould
of
the
forest
or
the
bare
ledges
of
the
rocks
in
time
he
even
learned
to
tell
from
the
sound
of
her
nervous
footfall
whether
she
came
back
hopeful
or
depressed
as
soon
as
he
heard
her
step
on
the
staircase
he
hurried
from
the
window
and
he
never
let
her
know
that
he
had
thus
followed
her
from
afar
in
her
wanderings
but
she
must
have
guessed
it
for
with
a
glance
she
always
afterwards
told
him
where
she
had
been
stay
indoors
and
don
t
go
out
he
begged
her
with
clasped
hands
one
morning
when
he
saw
her
still
unrecovered
from
the
fatigue
of
the
previous
day
you
drive
me
to
but
she
hastened
away
in
irritation
the
garden
now
that
it
rang
with
albine
s
footfalls
seemed
to
have
a
more
depressing
influence
than
ever
upon
serge
the
of
her
feet
was
yet
another
voice
that
called
him
an
imperious
voice
that
echoed
ever
more
and
more
loudly
within
him
he
closed
his
ears
and
tried
to
shut
out
the
sound
but
the
distant
footsteps
still
echoed
to
him
in
the
throbbings
of
his
heart
and
when
she
came
back
in
the
evening
it
was
the
whole
park
that
came
back
with
her
with
the
memories
of
their
walks
together
and
of
the
slow
dawn
of
their
love
in
the
midst
of
conniving
nature
she
seemed
to
have
grown
taller
and
graver
mellowed
matured
by
her
solitary
rambles
there
was
nothing
left
in
her
of
the
frolicsome
child
and
his
teeth
would
suddenly
set
at
times
when
he
looked
at
her
and
beheld
her
so
desirable
one
day
about
noon
serge
heard
albine
returning
in
hot
haste
he
had
restrained
himself
from
listening
for
her
steps
when
she
went
away
usually
she
did
not
return
till
late
and
he
was
amazed
at
her
impetuosity
as
she
sped
along
forcing
her
way
through
the
branches
that
barred
her
path
as
she
passed
beneath
his
window
he
heard
her
laugh
and
as
she
mounted
the
stairway
she
panted
so
heavily
that
he
almost
thought
he
could
feel
her
hot
breath
streaming
against
his
face
she
threw
the
door
wide
open
and
cried
out
i
have
found
it
then
she
sat
down
and
repeated
softly
breathlessly
i
have
found
it
i
have
found
it
serge
distracted
laid
his
fingers
on
her
lips
and
stammered
don
t
tell
me
anything
i
beg
you
i
want
to
know
nothing
of
it
it
will
kill
me
if
you
then
she
sank
into
silence
with
gleaming
eyes
and
lips
tightly
pressed
lest
the
words
she
kept
back
should
spring
out
in
spite
of
her
and
she
stayed
in
the
room
till
evening
trying
to
meet
serge
s
glance
and
imparting
to
him
each
time
that
their
eyes
met
something
of
that
which
she
had
discovered
her
whole
face
beamed
with
radiance
she
exhaled
a
delicious
odour
she
was
full
of
life
and
serge
felt
that
she
permeated
him
through
all
his
senses
despairingly
did
he
struggle
against
this
gradual
invasion
of
his
being
on
the
morrow
she
returned
to
his
room
as
soon
as
she
was
up
aren
t
you
going
out
he
asked
conscious
that
he
would
be
vanquished
should
she
remain
there
no
she
said
she
wasn
t
going
out
any
more
as
by
degrees
she
recovered
from
her
fatigue
he
felt
her
becoming
stronger
more
triumphant
she
would
soon
be
able
to
take
him
by
the
hand
and
drag
him
to
that
spot
whose
charm
her
silence
proclaimed
so
loudly
that
day
however
she
did
not
speak
she
contented
herself
with
keeping
him
seated
on
a
cushion
at
her
feet
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
she
ventured
to
say
why
do
you
shut
yourself
up
here
it
is
so
pleasant
under
the
he
rose
from
her
feet
and
stretched
out
his
arms
entreatingly
but
she
laughed
at
him
well
well
then
we
won
t
go
out
since
you
would
rather
not
but
this
room
has
such
a
strange
scent
and
we
should
be
much
more
comfortable
in
the
garden
it
is
very
wrong
of
you
to
have
taken
such
a
dislike
to
he
had
again
settled
himself
at
her
feet
in
silence
his
eyelids
lowered
his
features
quivering
with
passionate
emotion
we
won
t
go
out
she
repeated
so
don
t
worry
but
do
you
really
prefer
these
pictures
to
the
grass
and
flowers
in
the
park
do
you
remember
all
we
saw
together
it
is
these
paintings
which
make
us
feel
so
unhappy
they
are
a
nuisance
always
looking
and
watching
us
as
they
as
serge
gradually
leant
more
closely
against
her
she
passed
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
laid
his
head
upon
her
lap
while
murmuring
in
yet
a
lower
tone
there
is
a
little
corner
there
i
know
where
we
might
be
so
very
happy
nothing
would
trouble
us
there
the
fresh
air
would
cool
your
then
she
stopped
as
she
felt
him
quivering
she
was
afraid
lest
she
might
again
revive
his
old
fears
but
she
gradually
conquered
him
merely
by
the
caressing
gaze
of
her
blue
eyes
his
eyelids
were
now
raised
and
he
rested
there
quietly
wholly
hers
his
tremor
past
ah
if
you
only
knew
she
softly
breathed
and
seeing
that
he
continued
to
smile
she
went
on
boldly
it
is
all
a
lie
it
is
not
forbidden
you
are
a
man
now
and
ought
not
to
be
afraid
if
we
went
there
and
any
danger
threatened
me
you
would
protect
me
you
would
defend
me
would
you
not
you
could
carry
me
off
on
your
back
couldn
t
you
i
am
never
the
least
afraid
when
i
have
you
with
me
look
how
strong
your
arms
have
grown
what
is
there
for
any
one
with
such
strong
arms
as
yours
to
be
afraid
of
she
caressed
him
beguilingly
as
she
spoke
stroking
his
hair
and
neck
and
shoulders
with
her
hand
no
it
is
not
forbidden
she
resumed
that
is
only
a
story
for
stupids
and
was
invented
long
ago
by
some
one
who
didn
t
want
to
be
disturbed
in
the
most
charming
spot
in
the
whole
garden
as
soon
as
you
sat
down
on
that
grassy
carpet
you
would
be
happy
and
well
again
listen
then
come
with
he
shook
his
head
but
without
any
sign
of
vexation
as
though
indeed
he
liked
thus
being
teased
then
after
a
short
silence
grieved
to
see
her
pouting
and
longing
for
a
renewal
of
her
caresses
he
opened
his
lips
and
asked
where
is
it
she
did
not
answer
him
immediately
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
wandering
far
away
it
is
over
yonder
she
murmured
at
last
i
can
not
explain
to
you
clearly
one
has
to
go
down
the
long
avenue
and
then
to
turn
to
the
left
and
then
again
to
the
left
we
must
have
passed
it
at
least
a
score
of
times
you
might
look
for
it
for
ever
without
finding
it
if
i
didn
t
go
with
you
to
show
you
i
could
find
my
way
to
it
quite
straight
though
i
could
never
explain
it
to
and
who
took
you
there
i
don
t
know
that
morning
the
trees
and
plants
seemed
to
drive
me
there
the
long
branches
pushed
me
on
the
grass
bent
down
before
me
invitingly
the
paths
seemed
to
open
expressly
for
me
to
take
them
and
i
believe
the
animals
themselves
helped
to
lead
me
there
for
i
saw
a
stag
trotting
on
before
me
as
though
he
wanted
me
to
follow
while
a
company
of
bullfinches
flitted
on
from
tree
to
tree
and
warned
me
with
their
cries
whenever
i
was
about
to
take
a
wrong
and
is
it
very
beautiful
again
she
did
not
reply
deep
ecstasy
filled
her
eyes
at
last
when
she
was
able
to
speak
again
she
said
ah
so
beautiful
that
i
could
never
tell
you
of
it
i
was
so
charmed
that
i
was
conscious
only
of
some
supreme
joy
which
i
could
not
name
falling
from
the
leaves
and
slumbering
amid
the
grass
and
i
ran
back
here
to
take
you
along
with
me
that
i
might
not
be
without
then
she
clasped
her
arms
round
his
neck
again
and
entreated
him
passionately
her
lips
almost
pressed
to
his
own
oh
you
will
come
she
stammered
you
must
come
you
will
make
me
so
miserable
if
you
don
t
you
can
t
want
me
to
be
miserable
and
even
if
you
knew
that
you
would
die
there
even
if
that
shade
should
be
fatal
to
both
of
us
would
you
hesitate
or
cast
a
regretful
look
behind
we
should
remain
there
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
sleep
on
quietly
for
ever
in
one
anther
s
arms
ah
would
it
not
be
bliss
indeed
yes
yes
he
stammered
transported
by
her
passionate
entreaties
but
we
shall
not
die
she
continued
raising
her
voice
and
laughing
with
the
laugh
which
proclaims
woman
s
victory
we
shall
live
to
love
each
other
it
is
a
tree
of
life
a
tree
whose
shadow
will
make
us
stronger
more
perfect
more
complete
you
will
see
that
all
will
now
go
happily
some
blessed
joy
will
assuredly
descend
on
us
from
heaven
will
you
come
his
face
paled
and
his
eyelids
quivered
as
though
too
powerful
a
light
were
suddenly
beating
against
them
will
you
come
will
you
come
she
cried
again
yet
more
passionately
and
already
half
rising
to
her
feet
he
sprang
up
and
followed
her
at
first
with
tottering
steps
and
then
with
his
arm
thrown
round
her
waist
as
if
he
could
endure
no
separation
from
her
he
went
where
she
went
carried
along
in
the
warm
fragrance
that
streamed
from
her
hair
and
as
he
thus
remained
slightly
in
the
rear
she
turned
upon
him
a
face
so
radiant
with
love
such
tempting
lips
and
eyes
which
so
imperiously
bade
him
follow
that
he
would
have
gone
with
her
anywhere
trusting
and
unquestioning
like
a
dog
xv
they
went
down
and
out
into
the
garden
without
the
smile
fading
from
serge
s
face
all
that
he
saw
of
the
greenery
around
him
was
such
as
was
reflected
in
the
clear
depths
of
albine
s
eyes
as
they
approached
the
garden
smiled
and
smiled
again
a
murmur
of
content
sped
from
leaf
to
leaf
and
from
bough
to
bough
to
the
furthest
depths
of
the
avenues
for
days
and
days
the
garden
must
have
been
hoping
and
expecting
to
see
them
thus
clinging
to
one
another
making
their
peace
again
with
the
trees
and
searching
for
their
lost
love
on
the
grassy
banks
a
solemn
warning
breath
sighed
through
the
branches
the
afternoon
sky
was
drowsy
with
heat
the
plants
raised
their
bowing
heads
to
watch
them
pass
listen
whispered
albine
they
drop
into
silence
as
we
come
near
them
but
over
yonder
they
are
expecting
us
they
are
telling
each
other
the
way
they
must
lead
us
i
told
you
we
should
have
no
trouble
about
the
paths
the
trees
themselves
will
direct
us
with
their
spreading
the
whole
park
did
indeed
appear
to
be
impelling
them
gently
onward
in
their
rear
it
seemed
as
if
a
barrier
of
had
bristled
up
to
prevent
them
from
retracing
their
steps
while
in
front
of
them
the
grassy
lawns
spread
out
so
invitingly
that
they
glided
along
the
soft
slopes
without
thought
of
choosing
their
way
and
the
birds
are
coming
with
us
too
said
albine
it
is
the
tomtits
this
time
don
t
you
see
them
they
are
skimming
over
the
hedges
and
they
stop
at
each
turning
to
see
that
we
don
t
lose
our
then
she
added
all
the
living
things
of
the
park
are
with
us
can
t
you
hear
them
there
is
a
deep
rustling
close
behind
us
it
is
the
birds
in
the
trees
the
insects
in
the
grass
the
roebucks
and
the
stags
in
the
coppices
and
even
the
little
fishes
splashing
the
quiet
water
with
their
beating
fins
don
t
turn
round
or
you
will
frighten
them
ah
i
am
sure
we
have
a
rare
train
behind
they
still
walked
on
unfatigued
albine
spoke
only
to
charm
serge
with
the
music
of
her
voice
while
serge
obeyed
the
slightest
pressure
of
her
hand
they
knew
not
what
they
passed
but
they
were
certain
that
they
were
going
straight
towards
their
goal
and
as
they
went
along
the
garden
became
gradually
graver
more
discreet
the
soughing
of
the
branches
died
away
the
streams
hushed
their
plashing
waters
the
birds
the
beasts
and
the
insects
fell
into
silence
all
around
them
reigned
solemn
stillness
then
albine
and
serge
instinctively
raised
their
heads
in
front
of
them
they
beheld
a
colossal
mass
of
foliage
and
as
they
hesitated
for
a
moment
a
roe
after
gazing
at
them
with
its
sweet
soft
eyes
bounded
into
the
thickets
it
is
there
said
albine
she
led
the
way
her
face
again
turned
towards
serge
whom
she
drew
with
her
and
they
disappeared
amid
the
quivering
leaves
and
all
grew
quiet
again
they
were
entering
into
delicious
peace
in
the
centre
there
stood
a
tree
covered
with
so
dense
a
foliage
that
one
could
not
recognise
its
species
it
was
of
giant
girth
with
a
trunk
that
seemed
to
breathe
like
a
living
breast
and
boughs
that
stretched
like
protecting
arms
around
it
it
towered
up
there
beautiful
strong
virile
and
fruitful
it
was
the
king
of
the
garden
the
father
of
the
forest
the
pride
of
the
plants
the
beloved
of
the
sun
whose
earliest
and
latest
beams
smiled
daily
on
its
crest
from
its
green
vault
poured
all
the
joys
of
creation
fragrance
of
flowers
music
of
birds
gleams
of
golden
light
wakeful
freshness
of
dawn
slumbrous
warmth
of
evening
twilight
so
strong
was
the
sap
that
it
burst
through
the
very
bark
bathing
the
tree
with
the
powers
of
fruitfulness
making
it
the
symbol
of
earth
s
virility
its
presence
sufficed
to
give
the
clearing
an
enchanting
charm
the
other
trees
built
up
around
it
an
impenetrable
wall
which
isolated
it
as
in
a
sanctuary
of
silence
and
twilight
there
was
but
greenery
there
not
a
scrap
of
sky
not
a
glimpse
of
horizon
nothing
but
a
swelling
rotunda
draped
with
green
silkiness
of
leaves
adorned
below
with
mossy
velvet
and
one
entered
as
into
the
liquid
crystal
of
a
source
a
greenish
limpidity
a
sheet
of
silver
reposing
beneath
reflected
reeds
colours
perfumes
sounds
quivers
all
were
vague
indeterminate
transparent
steeped
in
a
felicity
amidst
which
everything
seemed
to
faint
away
languorous
warmth
the
glimmer
of
a
summer
s
night
as
it
fades
on
the
bare
shoulder
of
some
fair
girl
a
scarce
perceptible
murmur
of
love
sinking
into
silence
lingered
beneath
the
motionless
branches
unstirred
by
the
slightest
zephyr
it
was
hymeneal
solitude
a
chamber
where
nature
lay
hidden
in
the
embraces
of
the
sun
albine
and
serge
stood
there
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
as
soon
as
the
tree
had
received
them
beneath
its
shade
they
felt
eased
of
all
the
anxious
disquiet
which
had
so
long
distressed
them
the
fears
which
had
made
them
avoid
each
other
the
fierce
wrestling
of
spirit
which
had
torn
and
wounded
them
without
consciousness
on
their
part
of
what
they
were
really
contending
against
vanished
and
left
them
in
perfect
peace
absolute
confidence
supreme
serenity
now
pervaded
them
they
yielded
unhesitatingly
to
the
joy
of
being
together
in
that
lonely
nook
so
completely
hidden
from
the
outside
world
they
had
surrendered
themselves
to
the
garden
they
awaited
in
all
calmness
the
behests
of
that
tree
of
life
it
enveloped
them
in
such
ecstasy
of
love
that
the
whole
clearing
seemed
to
disappear
from
before
their
eyes
and
to
leave
them
wrapped
in
an
atmosphere
of
perfume
the
air
is
like
ripe
fruit
murmured
albine
and
serge
whispered
in
his
turn
the
grass
seems
so
full
of
life
and
motion
that
i
could
almost
think
i
was
treading
on
your
it
was
a
kind
of
religious
feeling
which
made
them
lower
their
voices
no
sentiment
of
curiosity
impelled
them
to
raise
their
heads
and
scan
the
tree
the
consciousness
of
its
majesty
weighed
heavily
upon
them
with
a
glance
albine
asked
whether
she
had
overrated
the
enchantment
of
the
greenery
and
serge
answered
her
with
two
tears
that
trickled
down
his
cheeks
the
joy
that
filled
them
at
being
there
could
not
be
expressed
in
words
come
she
whispered
in
his
ear
in
a
voice
that
was
softer
than
a
sigh
and
she
glided
on
in
front
of
him
and
seated
herself
at
the
very
foot
of
the
tree
then
with
a
fond
smile
she
stretched
out
her
hands
to
him
while
he
standing
before
her
grasped
them
in
his
own
with
a
responsive
smile
then
she
drew
him
slowly
towards
her
and
he
sank
down
by
her
side
ah
do
you
remember
he
said
that
wall
which
seemed
to
have
grown
up
between
us
now
there
is
nothing
to
keep
us
apart
you
are
not
unhappy
now
no
no
she
answered
very
for
a
moment
they
relapsed
into
silence
whilst
soft
emotion
stole
over
them
then
serge
caressing
albine
exclaimed
your
face
is
mine
your
eyes
your
mouth
your
cheeks
are
mine
your
arms
are
mine
from
your
shoulders
to
the
tips
of
your
nails
you
are
wholly
and
as
he
spoke
he
kissed
her
lips
her
eyes
her
cheeks
he
kissed
her
arms
with
quick
short
kisses
from
her
fingers
to
her
shoulders
he
poured
upon
her
a
rain
of
kisses
hot
as
a
summer
shower
deluging
her
cheeks
her
forehead
her
lips
and
her
neck
but
if
you
are
mine
i
am
yours
said
he
yours
for
ever
for
i
now
well
know
that
you
are
my
queen
my
sovereign
whom
i
must
worship
on
bended
knee
i
am
here
only
to
obey
you
to
lie
at
your
feet
to
anticipate
your
wishes
to
shelter
you
with
my
arms
to
drive
away
whatever
might
trouble
your
tranquillity
and
you
are
my
life
s
goal
since
i
first
awoke
in
this
garden
you
have
ever
been
before
me
i
have
grown
up
that
i
might
be
yours
ever
as
my
end
my
reward
have
i
gazed
upon
your
grace
you
passed
in
the
sunshine
with
the
sheen
of
your
golden
hair
you
were
a
promise
that
i
should
some
day
know
all
the
mysteries
and
necessities
of
creation
of
this
earth
of
these
trees
these
waters
these
skies
whose
last
secret
is
yet
unrevealed
i
belong
to
you
i
am
your
slave
i
will
listen
to
you
and
obey
you
with
my
lips
upon
your
he
said
this
bowed
to
the
ground
adoring
woman
and
albine
full
of
pride
allowed
herself
to
be
adored
she
yielded
her
hands
her
cheeks
her
lips
to
serge
s
rapturous
kisses
she
felt
herself
indeed
a
queen
as
she
saw
him
who
was
so
strong
bending
so
humbly
before
her
she
had
conquered
him
and
held
him
there
at
her
mercy
with
a
single
word
she
could
dispose
of
him
and
that
which
helped
her
to
recognise
her
omnipotence
was
that
she
heard
the
whole
garden
rejoicing
at
her
triumph
with
gradually
swelling
paeans
of
approval
ah
if
we
could
fly
off
together
if
we
could
but
die
even
in
one
another
s
arms
faltered
serge
scarce
able
to
articulate
but
albine
had
strength
enough
to
raise
her
finger
as
though
to
bid
him
listen
it
was
the
garden
that
had
planned
and
willed
it
all
for
weeks
and
weeks
it
had
been
favouring
and
encouraging
their
passion
and
at
last
on
that
supreme
day
it
had
lured
them
to
that
spot
and
now
it
became
the
tempter
whose
every
voice
spoke
of
love
from
the
amid
the
fragrance
of
the
languid
blossoms
was
wafted
a
soft
sighing
which
told
of
the
weddings
of
the
roses
the
of
the
violets
and
never
before
had
the
heliotropes
sent
forth
so
voluptuous
a
perfume
mingled
with
the
soft
air
which
arose
from
the
orchard
were
all
the
exhalations
of
ripe
fruit
the
vanilla
of
apricots
the
musk
of
oranges
all
the
luscious
aroma
of
fruitfulness
from
the
meadows
came
fuller
notes
the
million
sighs
of
the
grass
the
multitudinous
of
legions
of
living
things
here
and
there
softened
by
the
refreshing
caresses
of
the
rivulets
on
whose
banks
the
very
willows
palpitated
with
desire
and
the
forest
proclaimed
the
mighty
passion
of
the
oaks
through
the
high
branches
sounded
solemn
music
organ
strains
like
the
nuptial
marches
of
the
ashes
and
the
birches
the
hornbeams
and
the
planes
while
from
the
bushes
and
the
young
coppices
arose
noisy
mirth
like
that
of
youthful
lovers
chasing
one
another
over
banks
and
into
hollows
amid
much
crackling
and
snapping
of
branches
from
afar
too
the
faint
breeze
wafted
the
sounds
of
the
rocks
splitting
in
their
passion
beneath
the
burning
heat
while
near
them
the
spiky
plants
loved
in
a
tragic
fashion
of
their
own
unrefreshed
by
the
neighbouring
springs
which
themselves
glowed
with
the
love
of
the
passionate
sun
what
do
they
say
asked
serge
half
swooning
as
albine
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
the
voices
of
the
paradou
were
growing
yet
more
distinct
the
animals
in
their
turn
joined
in
the
universal
song
of
nature
the
grasshoppers
grew
faint
with
the
passion
of
their
chants
the
butterflies
scattered
kisses
with
their
beating
wings
the
amorous
sparrows
flew
to
their
mates
the
rivers
rippled
over
the
loves
of
the
fishes
whilst
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
nightingales
sent
forth
pearly
voluptuous
notes
and
the
stags
bellowed
their
love
aloud
reptiles
and
insects
every
species
of
invisible
life
every
atom
of
matter
the
earth
itself
joined
in
the
great
chorus
it
was
the
chorus
of
love
and
of
nature
the
chorus
of
the
whole
wide
world
and
in
the
very
sky
the
clouds
were
radiant
with
rapture
as
to
those
two
children
love
revealed
the
eternity
of
life
xvi
albine
and
serge
smiled
at
one
another
i
love
you
albine
said
serge
serge
i
love
you
albine
answered
and
never
before
had
those
syllables
i
love
you
had
for
them
so
supreme
a
meaning
they
expressed
everything
joy
pervaded
those
young
lovers
who
had
attained
to
the
fulness
of
life
they
felt
that
they
were
now
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
the
forces
of
the
world
and
with
their
happiness
mingled
the
placid
conviction
that
they
had
obeyed
the
universal
law
and
serge
seemed
to
have
awakened
to
life
to
rule
the
whole
far
expanse
under
the
free
heavens
his
feet
planted
themselves
more
firmly
on
the
ground
his
chest
expanded
there
was
pride
and
confidence
in
his
gait
and
demeanour
he
took
albine
by
the
hands
she
was
trembling
and
he
was
obliged
to
support
her
don
t
be
afraid
he
said
you
are
she
whom
i
it
was
albine
now
who
had
become
the
submissive
one
she
drooped
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
glancing
up
at
him
with
anxious
scrutiny
would
he
never
bear
her
spite
for
that
hour
of
adoration
in
which
he
had
called
himself
her
slave
but
he
smiled
and
stroked
her
hair
while
she
said
to
him
let
me
stay
like
this
in
your
arms
for
i
can
not
walk
without
you
i
will
make
myself
so
small
and
light
that
you
will
scarcely
know
i
am
then
becoming
very
serious
she
added
you
must
always
love
me
and
i
will
be
very
obedient
and
do
whatever
you
wish
i
will
yield
to
you
in
all
things
if
you
but
love
serge
felt
more
powerful
and
virile
on
seeing
her
so
humble
why
are
you
trembling
so
he
asked
her
i
can
have
no
cause
to
reproach
but
she
did
not
answer
him
she
gazed
almost
sadly
upon
the
tree
and
the
foliage
and
the
grass
around
them
foolish
child
he
said
laughing
are
you
afraid
that
i
shall
be
angry
with
you
for
your
love
we
have
loved
as
we
were
meant
to
love
let
me
kiss
but
dropping
her
eyelids
so
that
she
might
not
see
the
tree
she
said
in
a
low
whisper
take
me
away
serge
led
her
thence
pacing
slowly
and
giving
one
last
glance
at
the
spot
which
love
had
hallowed
the
shadows
in
the
clearing
were
growing
darker
and
a
gentle
quiver
coursed
through
the
foliage
when
they
emerged
from
the
wood
and
caught
sight
of
the
sun
still
shining
brightly
in
the
horizon
they
felt
easier
everything
around
serge
now
seemed
to
bend
down
before
him
and
pay
homage
to
his
love
the
garden
was
now
nothing
but
an
appanage
of
albine
s
beauty
and
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
and
fairer
amid
the
of
its
rulers
but
albine
s
joy
was
still
tinged
with
disquietude
she
would
suddenly
pause
amid
her
laughter
and
listen
anxiously
what
is
the
matter
asked
serge
nothing
she
replied
casting
furtive
glances
behind
her
they
did
not
know
in
what
corner
of
the
park
they
were
to
lose
themselves
in
their
capricious
wanderings
only
served
to
amuse
them
as
a
rule
but
that
day
they
experienced
anxious
embarrassment
by
degrees
they
quickened
their
pace
plunging
more
and
more
deeply
into
a
labyrinth
of
bushes
don
t
you
hear
asked
albine
nervously
as
she
suddenly
stopped
short
almost
breathless
serge
listened
a
prey
in
his
turn
to
the
anxiety
which
the
girl
could
no
longer
conceal
all
the
coppice
seems
full
of
voices
she
continued
it
sounds
as
though
there
were
people
deriding
us
listen
wasn
t
that
a
laugh
that
sounded
from
that
tree
and
over
yonder
did
not
the
grass
murmur
something
as
my
dress
brushed
against
it
no
no
he
said
anxious
to
reassure
her
the
garden
loves
us
and
if
it
said
anything
it
would
not
be
to
vex
or
annoy
us
don
t
you
remember
all
the
sweet
words
which
sounded
through
the
leaves
you
are
nervous
and
fancy
but
she
shook
her
head
and
faltered
i
know
very
well
that
the
garden
is
our
friend
so
it
must
be
some
one
who
has
broken
into
it
i
am
certain
i
hear
some
one
i
am
trembling
all
over
oh
take
me
away
and
hide
me
somewhere
i
beseech
then
they
went
on
again
scanning
every
tree
and
bush
and
imagining
that
they
could
see
faces
peering
at
them
from
behind
every
trunk
albine
was
certain
she
said
that
there
were
steps
pursuing
them
in
the
distance
let
us
hide
ourselves
she
begged
she
had
turned
quite
scarlet
it
was
modesty
a
sense
of
shame
which
had
laid
hold
of
her
like
a
fever
mantling
over
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
skin
which
never
previously
had
known
that
flush
serge
was
alarmed
at
seeing
her
thus
crimson
her
face
full
of
distress
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
he
tried
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
again
and
to
soothe
her
with
a
caress
but
she
slipped
away
from
him
and
with
a
despairing
gesture
made
sign
that
they
were
not
alone
and
her
blushes
grew
deeper
as
her
eyes
fell
upon
her
bare
arms
she
shuddered
when
her
loose
hanging
hair
stirred
against
her
neck
and
shoulders
the
slightest
touch
of
a
waving
bough
or
a
passing
insect
the
softest
breath
of
air
now
made
her
tremble
as
if
some
invisible
hand
were
grasping
at
her
calm
yourself
begged
serge
there
is
no
one
you
are
as
crimson
as
though
you
had
a
fever
let
us
rest
here
for
a
moment
do
i
beg
she
had
no
fever
at
all
she
said
but
she
wanted
to
get
back
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
no
one
might
laugh
at
her
and
ever
increasing
her
pace
she
plucked
handfuls
of
leaves
and
tendrils
from
the
hedges
which
she
entwined
about
her
she
fastened
a
branch
of
mulberry
over
her
hair
twisted
bindweed
round
her
arms
and
tied
it
to
her
wrists
and
circled
her
neck
with
such
long
sprays
of
laurustinus
that
her
bosom
was
hidden
as
by
a
veil
of
leaves
and
that
shame
of
hers
proved
contagious
serge
who
first
had
jested
asking
her
if
she
were
going
to
a
ball
glanced
at
himself
and
likewise
felt
alarmed
and
ashamed
to
a
point
that
he
also
wound
foliage
about
his
person
meantime
they
could
discover
no
way
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
bushes
but
all
at
once
at
the
end
of
the
path
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
an
obstacle
a
tall
grey
grave
mass
of
stone
it
was
the
wall
of
the
paradou
come
away
come
away
cried
albine
and
she
sought
to
drag
him
thence
but
they
had
not
taken
another
twenty
steps
before
they
again
came
upon
the
wall
they
then
skirted
it
at
a
ran
it
stretched
along
gloomy
and
stern
without
a
break
in
its
surface
but
suddenly
at
a
point
where
it
fringed
a
meadow
it
seemed
to
fall
away
a
great
breach
gaped
in
it
like
a
huge
window
of
light
opening
on
to
the
neighbouring
valley
it
must
have
been
the
very
hole
that
albine
had
one
day
spoken
of
which
she
said
she
had
blocked
up
with
brambles
and
stones
but
the
brambles
now
lay
scattered
around
like
severed
bits
of
rope
the
stones
had
been
thrown
some
distance
away
and
the
breach
itself
seemed
to
have
been
enlarged
by
some
furious
hand
xvii
ah
i
felt
sure
of
it
cried
albine
in
accents
of
supreme
despair
i
begged
you
to
take
me
away
serge
i
beseech
you
don
t
look
through
but
serge
in
spite
of
himself
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
on
the
threshold
of
the
breach
through
which
he
gazed
down
below
in
the
depths
of
the
valley
the
setting
sun
cast
a
sheet
of
gold
upon
the
village
of
les
artaud
which
showed
amidst
the
twilight
in
which
the
neighbouring
fields
were
already
steeped
one
could
plainly
distinguish
the
houses
that
straggled
along
the
high
road
the
little
yards
with
their
dunghills
and
the
narrow
gardens
planted
with
vegetables
higher
up
the
tall
cypress
in
the
graveyard
reared
its
dusky
silhouette
and
the
red
tiles
on
the
church
glowed
the
dark
bell
looking
down
on
them
like
a
human
face
while
the
old
parsonage
at
the
side
threw
its
doors
and
windows
open
to
the
evening
air
for
pity
s
sake
sobbed
albine
don
t
look
out
serge
remember
that
you
promised
you
would
always
love
me
ah
will
you
ever
love
me
enough
now
stay
let
me
cover
your
eyes
with
my
hands
you
know
it
was
my
hands
that
cured
you
you
won
t
push
me
but
he
put
her
from
him
gently
then
while
she
fell
down
and
clung
to
his
legs
he
passed
his
hands
across
his
face
as
though
he
were
wiping
from
his
brow
and
eyes
some
last
lingering
traces
of
sleep
it
was
yonder
then
that
lay
the
unknown
world
the
strange
land
of
which
he
had
never
dreamed
without
vague
fear
where
had
he
seen
that
country
from
what
dream
was
he
awakening
that
he
felt
such
keen
anguish
swelling
up
in
his
breast
till
it
almost
choked
him
the
village
was
breaking
out
into
life
at
the
close
of
the
day
s
work
the
men
were
coming
home
from
the
fields
with
weary
gait
their
jackets
thrown
over
their
shoulders
the
women
standing
by
their
doors
were
beckoning
to
them
to
hasten
on
while
the
children
in
noisy
bands
chased
the
fowls
about
and
pelted
them
with
stones
in
the
churchyard
a
couple
of
scapegraces
a
lad
and
a
girl
were
creeping
along
under
the
shelter
of
the
wall
in
order
to
escape
notice
swarms
of
sparrows
were
retiring
to
roost
beneath
the
eaves
of
the
church
and
on
the
steps
of
the
parsonage
a
blue
calico
skirt
had
just
appeared
of
such
spreading
dimensions
as
to
quite
block
the
doorway
oh
he
is
looking
out
he
is
looking
out
sobbed
albine
listen
to
me
it
was
only
just
now
that
you
promised
to
obey
me
i
beg
of
you
to
turn
round
and
to
look
upon
the
garden
haven
t
you
been
very
happy
in
the
garden
it
was
the
garden
which
gave
me
to
you
think
of
the
happy
days
it
has
in
store
for
us
what
lasting
bliss
and
enjoyment
instead
of
which
it
will
be
death
that
will
force
its
way
through
that
hole
if
you
don
t
quickly
flee
and
take
me
with
you
see
all
those
people
yonder
will
come
and
thrust
themselves
between
us
we
were
so
quite
alone
so
secluded
so
well
guarded
by
the
trees
oh
the
garden
is
our
love
look
on
the
garden
i
beg
it
of
you
on
my
knees
but
serge
was
quivering
he
had
began
to
recollect
the
past
was
he
could
distinctly
hear
the
stir
of
the
village
life
those
peasants
those
women
and
children
he
knew
them
there
was
the
mayor
bambousse
returning
from
les
olivettes
calculating
how
much
the
approaching
vintage
would
yield
him
there
were
the
brichets
the
husband
crawling
along
and
the
wife
moaning
with
misery
there
was
rosalie
flirting
with
big
fortune
behind
a
wall
he
recognised
also
the
pair
in
the
churchyard
that
mischievous
vincent
and
that
bold
hussy
catherine
who
were
catching
big
grasshoppers
amongst
the
tombstones
yes
and
they
had
voriau
the
black
dog
with
them
helping
them
and
ferreting
about
in
the
dry
grass
and
sniffing
at
every
crack
in
the
old
stones
under
the
eaves
of
the
church
the
sparrows
were
twittering
and
bickering
before
going
to
roost
the
boldest
of
them
flew
down
and
entered
the
church
through
the
broken
windows
and
as
serge
followed
them
with
his
eyes
he
recollected
all
the
noise
they
had
formerly
made
below
the
pulpit
and
on
the
step
by
the
altar
rails
where
crumbs
were
always
put
for
them
and
that
was
la
teuse
yonder
on
the
parsonage
doorstep
looking
fatter
than
ever
in
her
blue
calico
dress
she
was
turning
her
head
to
smile
at
desiree
who
was
coming
up
from
the
yard
laughing
noisily
then
they
both
vanished
indoors
and
serge
distracted
with
all
these
revived
memories
stretched
out
his
arms
it
is
all
over
now
faltered
albine
as
she
sank
down
amongst
the
broken
brambles
you
will
never
love
me
enough
she
wept
while
serge
stood
rooted
by
the
breach
straining
his
ears
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
that
might
be
wafted
from
the
village
waiting
as
it
were
for
some
voice
that
might
fully
awaken
him
the
bell
in
the
had
begun
to
sway
and
slowly
through
the
quiet
evening
air
the
three
chimes
of
the
floated
up
to
the
paradou
it
was
a
soft
and
silvery
summons
the
bell
now
seemed
to
be
alive
o
god
cried
serge
falling
on
his
knees
quite
overcome
by
the
emotion
which
the
soft
notes
of
the
bell
had
excited
in
him
he
bent
down
towards
the
ground
and
he
felt
the
three
peals
of
the
pass
over
his
neck
and
echo
through
his
heart
the
voice
of
the
bell
seemed
to
grow
louder
it
was
raised
again
sternly
pitilessly
for
a
few
moments
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
years
it
summoned
up
before
him
all
his
old
life
his
pious
childhood
his
happy
days
at
the
seminary
and
his
first
masses
in
that
burning
valley
of
les
artaud
where
he
had
dreamt
of
a
solitary
saintly
life
he
had
always
heard
it
speaking
to
him
as
it
was
doing
now
he
recognised
every
inflection
of
that
sacred
voice
which
had
so
constantly
fallen
upon
his
ears
like
the
grave
and
gentle
voice
of
a
mother
why
had
he
so
long
ceased
to
hear
it
in
former
times
it
had
promised
him
the
coming
of
mary
had
mary
come
then
and
taken
him
and
carried
him
off
into
those
happy
green
fastnesses
which
the
sound
of
the
bell
could
not
reach
he
would
never
have
lapsed
into
forgetfulness
if
the
bell
had
not
ceased
to
ring
and
as
he
bent
his
head
still
lower
towards
the
earth
the
contact
of
his
beard
with
his
hands
made
him
start
he
could
not
recognise
his
own
self
with
that
long
silky
beard
he
twisted
it
and
fumbled
about
in
his
hair
seeking
for
the
bare
circle
of
the
tonsure
but
a
heavy
growth
of
curls
now
covered
his
whole
head
from
his
brow
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
ah
you
were
right
he
said
casting
a
look
of
despair
at
albine
it
was
forbidden
we
have
sinned
and
we
have
merited
some
terrible
punishment
but
i
indeed
i
tried
to
reassure
you
i
did
not
hear
the
threats
which
sounded
in
your
ears
through
the
albine
tried
to
clasp
him
in
her
arms
again
as
she
sobbed
out
get
up
and
let
us
escape
together
perhaps
even
yet
there
is
time
for
us
to
love
each
no
no
i
haven
t
the
strength
i
should
stumble
and
fall
over
the
smallest
pebble
in
the
path
listen
to
me
i
am
afraid
of
myself
i
know
not
what
man
dwells
in
me
i
have
murdered
myself
and
my
hands
are
red
with
blood
if
you
took
me
away
you
would
never
see
aught
in
my
eyes
save
she
kissed
his
wet
eyes
as
she
answered
passionately
no
matter
do
you
love
me
he
was
too
terrified
to
answer
her
a
heavy
step
set
the
pebbles
rolling
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
a
growl
of
anger
seemed
to
draw
nigh
albine
had
not
been
mistaken
some
one
was
indeed
there
disturbing
the
woodland
quiet
with
jealous
inquisition
then
both
albine
and
serge
as
if
overwhelmed
with
shame
sought
to
bide
themselves
behind
a
bush
but
brother
archangias
standing
in
front
of
the
breach
could
already
see
them
the
brother
remained
for
a
moment
silent
clenching
his
fists
and
looking
at
albine
clinging
round
serge
s
neck
with
the
disgust
of
a
man
who
has
espied
some
filth
by
the
roadside
i
suspected
it
he
mumbled
between
his
teeth
it
was
virtually
certain
that
they
had
hidden
him
then
he
took
a
few
steps
and
cried
out
i
see
you
it
is
an
abomination
are
you
a
brute
beast
to
go
coursing
through
the
woods
with
that
female
she
has
led
you
far
astray
has
she
not
she
has
besmeared
you
with
filth
and
now
you
are
hairy
like
a
goat
pluck
a
branch
from
the
trees
wherewith
to
smite
her
on
the
again
albine
whispered
in
an
ardent
prayerful
voice
do
you
love
me
do
you
love
me
but
serge
with
bowed
head
kept
silence
though
he
did
not
yet
drive
her
from
him
fortunately
i
have
found
you
continued
brother
archangias
i
discovered
this
hole
you
have
disobeyed
god
and
have
slain
your
own
peace
henceforward
for
ever
temptation
will
gnaw
you
with
its
fiery
tooth
and
you
will
no
longer
have
ignorance
of
evil
to
help
you
to
fight
it
it
was
that
creature
who
tempted
you
to
your
fall
was
it
not
do
you
not
see
the
serpent
s
tail
writhing
amongst
her
hair
the
mere
sight
of
her
shoulders
is
sufficient
to
make
one
vomit
with
disgust
leave
her
touch
her
not
for
she
is
the
beginning
of
hell
in
the
name
of
god
come
forth
from
that
do
you
love
me
oh
do
you
love
me
reiterated
albine
but
serge
hastily
drew
away
from
her
as
though
her
bare
arms
and
shoulders
really
scorched
him
in
the
name
of
god
in
the
name
of
god
cried
the
brother
in
a
voice
of
thunder
serge
unresistingly
stepped
towards
the
breach
as
soon
as
brother
archangias
with
rough
violence
had
dragged
him
out
of
the
paradou
albine
who
had
fallen
half
fainting
to
the
ground
with
hands
wildly
stretched
towards
the
love
which
was
deserting
her
rose
up
again
choking
with
sobs
and
she
fled
vanished
into
the
midst
of
the
trees
whose
trunks
she
lashed
with
her
streaming
hair

iii
i
when
abbe
mouret
had
said
the
he
bowed
to
the
altar
and
went
to
the
epistle
side
then
he
came
down
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
over
big
fortune
and
rosalie
who
were
kneeling
side
by
side
before
the
conjungo
vos
in
matrimonium
in
nomine
patris
et
filii
et

responded
vincent
who
was
serving
the
mass
and
glancing
curiously
at
his
big
brother
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
fortune
and
rosalie
bent
their
heads
affected
by
some
slight
emotion
although
they
had
nudged
each
other
with
their
elbows
when
they
knelt
down
by
way
of
making
one
another
laugh
but
vincent
went
to
get
the
basin
and
the
sprinkler
fortune
placed
the
ring
in
the
basin
a
thick
ring
of
solid
silver
when
the
priest
had
blessed
it
sprinkling
it
crosswise
he
returned
it
to
fortune
who
slipped
it
upon
rosalie
s
finger
her
hand
was
still
discoloured
with
which
soap
had
not
been
able
to
remove

abbe

murmured
again
giving
them
a
final
benediction
responded
vincent
it
was
early
morning
the
sun
was
not
yet
shining
through
the
big
windows
of
the
church
outside
one
could
hear
the
noisy
twittering
of
the
sparrows
in
the
branches
of
the
service
tree
whose
foliage
shot
through
the
broken
panes
la
teuse
who
had
not
previously
had
time
to
clean
the
church
was
now
dusting
the
altar
craning
up
on
her
sound
leg
to
wipe
the
feet
of
the
ochre
and
christ
and
arranging
the
chairs
as
quietly
as
possible
all
the
while
bowing
and
crossing
herself
and
following
the
service
but
not
omitting
a
single
sweep
of
her
feather
broom
quite
alone
at
the
foot
of
the
pulpit
was
mother
brichet
praying
in
a
very
demonstrative
fashion
she
kept
on
her
knees
and
repeated
the
prayers
in
so
loud
a
whisper
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
swarm
of
bluebottles
had
taken
possession
of
the
nave
at
the
other
end
of
the
church
near
the
confessional
catherine
held
an
infant
in
swaddling
clothes
as
it
began
to
cry
she
turned
her
back
upon
the
altar
and
tossed
it
up
and
amused
it
with
the
which
dangled
just
over
its
nose
said
the
priest
turning
round
and
spreading
out
his
hands
cum
spiritu
responded
vincent
at
that
moment
three
big
girls
came
into
the
church
they
were
too
shy
to
go
far
up
though
they
jostled
one
another
to
get
a
better
view
of
what
was
going
on
they
were
three
friends
of
rosalie
who
had
dropped
in
for
a
minute
or
two
on
their
way
to
the
fields
curious
as
they
were
to
hear
what
his
reverence
would
say
to
the
bride
and
bridegroom
they
had
big
scissors
hanging
at
their
waists
at
last
they
hid
themselves
behind
the
font
where
they
pinched
each
other
and
twisted
themselves
about
while
trying
to
choke
their
bursts
of
laughter
with
their
clenched
fists
well
whispered
la
rousse
a
finely
built
girl
with
skin
and
hair
there
won
t
be
any
scrimmage
to
get
out
of
church
when
it
s
all
oh
old
bambousse
is
quite
right
murmured
lisa
a
short
dark
girl
with
gleaming
eyes
when
one
has
vines
one
looks
after
them
since
his
reverence
so
particularly
desired
to
marry
rosalie
he
can
very
well
do
it
all
the
other
girl
babet
who
was
humpbacked
tittered
there
s
mother
brichet
she
said
she
is
always
here
she
prays
for
the
whole
family
listen
do
you
hear
how
she
s
buzzing
all
that
will
mean
something
in
her
pocket
she
knows
very
well
what
she
is
about
i
can
tell
she
is
playing
the
organ
for
them
retorted
la
rousse
at
this
all
three
burst
into
a
laugh
la
teuse
in
the
distance
threatened
them
with
her
broom
at
the
altar
abbe
mouret
was
taking
the
sacrament
as
he
went
from
the
epistle
side
towards
vincent
so
that
the
water
of
ablution
might
be
poured
upon
his
thumb
and
lisa
said
more
softly
it
s
nearly
over
he
will
begin
to
talk
to
them
yes
said
la
rousse
and
so
big
fortune
will
still
be
able
to
go
to
his
work
and
rosalie
won
t
lose
her
day
s
pay
at
the
vintage
it
is
very
convenient
to
be
married
so
early
in
the
morning
he
looks
very
sheepish
that
big
of
course
murmured
babet
it
tires
him
keeping
so
long
on
his
knees
you
may
be
sure
that
he
has
never
knelt
so
long
since
his
first
but
the
girls
attention
was
suddenly
distracted
by
the
baby
which
catherine
was
dangling
in
her
arms
it
wanted
to
get
hold
of
the
and
was
quite
blue
with
rage
frantically
stretching
out
its
little
hands
and
almost
choking
itself
with
crying
ah
so
the
youngster
is
there
said
la
rousse
the
baby
now
burst
into
still
louder
wailing
and
struggled
like
a
little
imp
turn
it
over
on
its
stomach
and
let
it
suck
said
babet
to
catherine
catherine
lifted
up
her
head
and
began
to
laugh
with
the
shamelessness
of
a
little
minx
it
s
not
at
all
amusing
she
said
giving
the
baby
a
shake
be
quiet
will
you
little
pig
my
sister
plumped
it
down
on
my
naturally
said
babet
mischievously
you
could
scarcely
have
expected
her
to
give
the
brat
to
monsieur
le
cure
to
at
this
sally
la
rousse
almost
fell
over
in
a
fit
of
laughter
she
leaned
against
the
wall
holding
her
sides
with
her
hands
lisa
threw
herself
against
her
and
attempted
to
soothe
her
by
pinching
her
back
and
shoulders
while
babet
laughed
with
a
hunchback
s
laugh
which
grated
on
the
ear
like
the
sound
of
a
saw
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
little
one
she
continued
monsieur
le
cure
would
have
lost
all
use
for
his
holy
water
old
bambousse
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
rosalie
to
young
laurent
of
however
the
girls
merriment
and
their
chatter
now
came
to
an
end
for
they
saw
la
teuse
limping
furiously
towards
them
at
this
the
three
big
hussies
felt
alarmed
stepped
back
and
subsided
into
sedateness
you
worthless
things
hissed
la
teuse
you
come
to
talk
a
lot
of
filth
here
do
you
aren
t
you
ashamed
of
yourself
la
rousse
you
ought
to
be
there
on
your
knees
before
the
altar
like
rosalie
i
will
throw
you
outside
if
you
stir
again
do
you
hear
la
rousse
s
copper
cheeks
were
tinged
with
a
rising
blush
and
babet
glanced
at
her
and
tittered
and
you
continued
la
teuse
turning
towards
catherine
just
you
leave
that
baby
alone
you
are
pinching
it
on
purpose
to
make
it
scream
don
t
tell
me
you
are
not
give
it
to
she
took
the
child
hushed
it
in
her
arms
for
a
moment
and
then
laid
it
upon
a
chair
where
it
went
to
sleep
peacefully
like
a
cherub
the
church
then
subsided
into
solemn
quietness
disturbed
only
by
the
chattering
of
the
sparrows
on
the
rowan
tree
outside
at
the
altar
vincent
had
carried
the
missal
to
the
right
again
and
abbe
mouret
had
just
folded
the
corporal
and
slipped
it
within
the
burse
he
was
now
saying
the
concluding
prayers
with
a
solemn
earnestness
which
neither
the
screams
of
the
baby
nor
the
giggling
of
the
three
girls
had
been
able
to
disturb
he
seemed
to
hear
nothing
of
them
but
to
be
wholly
absorbed
in
the
prayers
which
he
was
offering
up
to
heaven
for
the
happiness
of
the
pair
whose
union
he
had
just
blessed
the
sky
that
morning
was
grey
with
a
hazy
heat
which
veiled
the
sun
through
the
broken
windows
a
russet
vapour
streamed
into
the
church
betokening
a
stormy
day
along
the
walls
the
gaudily
coloured
pictures
of
the
stations
of
the
cross
displayed
their
red
blue
and
yellow
patches
at
the
bottom
of
the
nave
the
dry
woodwork
of
the
gallery
creaked
and
strained
and
under
the
doorway
the
tall
grass
by
the
steps
thrust
ripening
straw
all
alive
with
little
brown
grasshoppers
the
clock
in
its
wooden
case
made
a
whirring
noise
as
though
it
were
some
consumptive
trying
to
clear
his
throat
and
then
huskily
struck
six
missa
said
the
priest
turning
round
to
the
congregation
responded
vincent
then
having
kissed
the
altar
abbe
mouret
once
more
turned
round
and
murmured
over
the
bent
heads
of
the
newly
married
pair
the
final
benediction
abraham
deus
isaac
et
deus
jacob
vobiscum
his
voice
dying
away
into
a
gentle
whisper
now
he
s
going
to
address
them
said
babet
to
her
friends
he
is
very
pale
observed
lisa
he
isn
t
a
bit
like
monsieur
caffin
whose
fat
face
always
seemed
to
be
on
the
laugh
my
little
sister
rose
says
that
she
daren
t
tell
him
anything
when
she
goes
to
all
the
same
murmured
la
rousse
he
s
not
ugly
his
illness
has
aged
him
a
little
but
it
seems
to
suit
him
he
has
bigger
eyes
and
lines
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
which
make
him
look
like
a
man
before
he
had
the
fever
he
was
too
much
like
a
i
believe
he
s
got
some
great
trouble
said
babet
he
looks
as
though
he
were
pining
away
his
face
is
deadly
pale
but
how
his
eyes
glitter
when
he
drops
his
eyelids
it
is
just
as
though
he
were
doing
it
to
extinguish
the
fire
in
his
la
teuse
again
shook
her
broom
at
them
hush
she
hissed
out
so
energetically
that
it
seemed
as
if
a
blast
of
wind
had
burst
into
the
church
meantime
abbe
mouret
had
collected
himself
and
he
began
in
a
rather
low
voice
my
dear
brother
my
dear
sister
you
are
joined
together
in
jesus
the
institution
of
marriage
symbolises
the
sacred
union
between
jesus
and
his
church
it
is
a
bond
which
nothing
can
break
which
god
wills
shall
be
eternal
so
that
man
may
not
sever
those
whom
heaven
has
joined
in
making
you
flesh
of
each
other
s
flesh
and
bone
of
each
other
s
bone
god
teaches
you
that
it
is
your
duty
to
walk
side
by
side
through
life
a
faithful
couple
along
the
paths
which
he
in
his
omnipotence
appoints
for
you
and
you
must
love
each
other
with
love
the
slightest
between
you
will
be
disobedience
to
the
creator
who
has
joined
you
together
as
a
single
body
remain
then
for
ever
united
after
the
likeness
of
the
church
which
jesus
has
espoused
in
giving
to
us
all
his
body
and
big
fortune
and
rosalie
sat
listening
with
their
noses
peaked
up
inquisitively
what
does
he
say
asked
lisa
who
was
a
little
deaf
oh
he
says
what
they
all
say
answered
la
rousse
he
has
a
glib
tongue
like
all
the
priests
abbe
mouret
went
on
with
his
address
his
eyes
wandering
over
the
heads
of
the
newly
wedded
couple
towards
a
shadowy
corner
of
the
church
and
by
degrees
his
voice
became
more
flexible
and
he
put
emotion
into
the
words
he
spoke
words
which
he
had
formerly
learned
by
heart
from
a
manual
intended
for
the
use
of
young
priests
he
had
turned
slightly
towards
rosalie
and
whenever
his
memory
failed
him
he
added
sentences
of
his
own
my
dear
sister
submit
yourself
to
your
husband
as
the
church
submits
itself
to
jesus
remember
that
you
must
leave
everything
to
follow
him
like
a
faithful
handmaiden
you
must
give
up
father
and
mother
you
must
cleave
only
to
your
husband
and
you
must
obey
him
that
you
may
obey
god
also
and
your
yoke
will
be
a
yoke
of
love
and
peace
be
his
comfort
his
happiness
the
perfume
of
his
days
of
strength
the
support
of
his
days
of
weakness
let
him
find
you
as
a
grace
ever
by
his
side
let
him
have
but
to
reach
out
his
hand
to
find
yours
grasping
it
it
is
thus
that
you
will
step
along
together
never
losing
your
way
and
that
you
will
meet
with
happiness
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
divine
laws
oh
my
dear
sister
my
dear
daughter
your
humility
will
hear
sweet
fruit
it
will
give
birth
to
all

purity
in

that
god
has
established
the
strength
of
your
as
abbe
mouret
spoke
these
words
there
was
a
burst
of
laughter
at
the
other
end
of
the
church
the
baby
had
just
woke
up
on
the
chair
where
la
teuse
had
laid
it
but
it
was
no
longer
in
a
bad
temper
having
kicked
itself
free
of
its
swaddling
clothes
it
was
laughing
merrily
and
shaking
its
rosy
little
feet
in
the
air
it
was
the
sight
of
these
little
feet
that
made
it
laugh
rosalie
who
was
beginning
to
find
the
priest
s
address
rather
tedious
turned
her
head
to
smile
at
the
child
but
when
she
saw
it
kicking
about
on
the
chair
she
grew
alarmed
and
cast
an
angry
look
at
catherine
oh
you
can
look
at
me
as
much
as
you
like
said
catherine
i
m
not
going
to
take
it
any
more
it
would
only
begin
to
cry
and
she
turned
aside
to
ferret
in
an
at
a
corner
of
one
of
the
stone
flags
under
the
gallery
monsieur
caffin
didn
t
talk
so
long
now
remarked
la
rousse
when
he
married
miette
he
just
gave
her
two
taps
on
the
cheek
and
told
her
to
be
my
dear
brother
resumed
abbe
mouret
turning
towards
big
fortune
it
is
god
who
gives
you
a
companion
for
he
does
not
wish
that
man
should
live
alone
but
if
he
ordains
that
she
shall
be
your
servant
he
demands
from
you
that
you
shall
be
to
her
a
master
full
of
gentleness
and
love
you
will
love
her
because
she
is
part
of
your
own
flesh
of
your
own
blood
and
your
own
bone
you
will
protect
her
because
god
has
given
you
strong
arms
only
that
you
may
stretch
them
over
her
head
in
the
hour
of
danger
remember
that
she
is
entrusted
to
you
and
that
you
can
not
abuse
her
submission
and
weakness
without
sin
oh
my
dear
brother
what
proud
happiness
should
be
yours
henceforth
you
will
no
longer
live
in
the
selfish
egotism
of
solitude
at
all
hours
you
will
have
a
lovable
duty
before
you
there
is
nothing
better
than
to
love
unless
it
be
to
protect
those
whom
we
love
your
heart
will
expand
your
manly
strength
will
increase
a
hundredfold
oh
to
be
a
support
and
stay
to
have
a
love
given
into
your
keeping
to
see
a
being
sink
her
existence
in
yours
and
say
take
me
and
do
with
me
what
you
will
i
trust
myself
wholly
to
you
and
may
you
be
accursed
if
you
ever
abandon
her
it
would
be
a
cowardly
desertion
which
god
would
assuredly
punish
from
the
moment
she
gives
herself
to
you
she
becomes
yours
for
ever
carry
her
rather
in
your
arms
and
set
her
not
upon
the
ground
until
it
be
certain
that
she
will
be
there
in
safety
give
up
everything
my
dear
brother
but
here
the
abbe
s
voice
faltered
and
only
an
indistinct
murmur
came
from
his
lips
he
had
quite
closed
his
eyes
his
face
was
deathly
white
and
his
voice
betokened
such
deep
distress
that
big
fortune
himself
shed
tears
without
knowing
why
he
hasn
t
recovered
yet
said
lisa
it
is
wrong
of
him
to
fatigue
himself
see
there
s
fortune
crying
men
are
than
women
murmured
babet
he
spoke
very
well
all
the
same
remarked
la
rousse
those
priests
think
of
a
lot
of
things
that
wouldn
t
occur
to
anybody
hush
cried
la
teuse
who
was
already
making
ready
to
extinguish
the
candles
but
abbe
mouret
still
stammered
on
trying
to
utter
a
few
more
sentences
it
is
for
this
reason
my
dear
brother
my
dear
sister
that
you
must
live
in
the
catholic
faith
which
alone
can
ensure
the
peace
of
your
hearth
your
families
have
taught
you
to
love
god
to
pray
to
him
every
morning
and
evening
to
look
only
for
the
gifts
of
his
mercy
he
was
unable
to
finish
he
turned
round
took
the
chalice
off
the
altar
and
retired
with
bowed
head
into
the
vestry
preceded
by
vincent
who
almost
let
the
cruets
and
napkin
fall
in
trying
to
see
what
catherine
might
be
doing
at
the
end
of
the
church
oh
the
heartless
creature
said
rosalie
who
left
her
husband
to
go
and
take
her
baby
in
her
arms
the
child
laughed
she
kissed
it
and
rearranged
its
swaddling
clothes
while
threatening
catherine
with
her
fist
if
it
had
fallen
she
cried
out
i
would
have
boxed
your
ears
for
you
big
fortune
now
came
slouching
along
the
three
girls
stepped
towards
him
with
compressed
lips
see
how
proud
he
is
murmured
babet
to
the
others
he
is
sure
of
inheriting
old
bambousse
s
money
now
i
used
to
see
him
creeping
along
every
night
under
the
little
wall
with
then
they
giggled
and
big
fortune
standing
there
in
front
of
them
laughed
even
louder
than
they
did
he
pinched
la
rousse
and
let
lisa
jeer
at
him
he
was
a
sturdy
young
blood
and
cared
nothing
for
anybody
the
priest
s
address
had
annoyed
him
hallo
mother
come
on
he
called
in
his
loud
voice
but
mother
brichet
was
begging
at
the
vestry
door
she
stood
there
tearful
and
wizen
before
la
teuse
who
was
slipping
some
eggs
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
fortune
didn
t
seem
to
feel
the
least
sense
of
shame
he
just
winked
and
remarked
she
is
a
knowing
old
card
my
mother
is
but
then
the
cure
likes
to
see
people
at
meanwhile
rosalie
had
grown
calm
again
before
leaving
the
church
she
asked
fortune
if
he
had
begged
the
priest
to
come
and
bless
their
room
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
so
fortune
ran
off
to
the
vestry
striding
heavily
through
the
church
as
if
it
were
a
field
he
soon
reappeared
shouting
that
his
reverence
would
come
la
teuse
who
was
scandalised
at
the
noise
made
by
all
these
people
who
seemed
to
think
themselves
in
a
public
street
gently
clapped
her
hands
and
pushed
them
towards
the
door
it
is
all
over
said
she
go
away
and
get
to
your
she
thought
they
had
all
gone
when
her
eye
caught
sight
of
catherine
whom
vincent
had
joined
they
were
bending
anxiously
over
the
ants
nest
catherine
was
poking
a
long
straw
into
the
hole
so
roughly
that
a
swarm
of
frightened
ants
had
rushed
out
upon
the
floor
vincent
declared
however
that
she
must
get
her
straw
right
to
the
bottom
if
she
wished
to
find
the
queen
ah
you
young
imps
cried
la
teuse
what
are
you
after
there
can
t
you
leave
the
poor
little
things
alone
that
is
mademoiselle
desiree
s
ants
nest
she
would
be
nicely
pleased
if
she
saw
you
at
this
the
children
promptly
took
to
their
heels
ii
abbe
mouret
now
wearing
his
cassock
but
still
bareheaded
had
come
back
to
kneel
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
in
the
grey
light
that
streamed
through
the
window
his
tonsure
showed
like
a
large
livid
spot
amidst
his
hair
and
a
slight
quiver
as
if
from
cold
sped
down
his
neck
with
his
hands
tightly
clasped
he
was
praying
earnestly
so
absorbed
in
his
devotions
that
he
did
not
hear
the
heavy
footsteps
of
la
teuse
who
hovered
around
without
daring
to
disturb
him
she
seemed
to
be
grieved
at
seeing
him
bowed
down
there
on
his
knees
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
he
was
in
tears
and
thereupon
she
went
behind
the
altar
to
watch
him
since
his
return
she
had
never
liked
to
leave
him
in
the
church
alone
for
one
evening
she
had
found
him
lying
in
a
dead
faint
upon
the
flagstones
with
icy
lips
and
clenched
teeth
like
a
corpse
come
in
mademoiselle
she
said
to
desiree
who
was
peeping
through
the
he
is
still
here
and
he
will
lay
himself
up
you
know
you
are
the
only
person
that
he
will
listen
it
is
she
replied
softly
and
i
am
very
then
she
gently
sidled
up
to
the
priest
passed
an
arm
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
good
morning
brother
she
said
do
you
want
to
make
me
die
of
hunger
this
morning
the
face
he
turned
upon
her
was
so
intensely
sad
that
she
kissed
him
again
on
both
his
cheeks
he
was
emerging
from
agony
then
on
recognising
her
he
tried
to
put
her
from
him
but
she
kept
hold
of
one
of
his
hands
and
would
not
release
it
she
would
scarcely
allow
him
to
cross
himself
but
insisted
upon
leading
him
away
come
come
for
i
am
very
hungry
you
must
be
hungry
la
teuse
had
laid
out
the
breakfast
beneath
two
big
mulberry
trees
whose
spreading
branches
formed
a
sheltering
roof
at
the
bottom
of
the
little
garden
the
sun
which
had
at
last
succeeded
in
dissipating
the
vapours
of
early
morning
was
warming
the
beds
of
vegetables
while
the
cast
a
broad
shadow
over
the
rickety
table
on
which
were
laid
two
cups
of
milk
and
some
thick
slices
of
bread
you
see
how
nice
it
looks
said
desiree
delighted
at
breakfasting
in
the
fresh
air
she
was
already
cutting
some
of
the
bread
into
strips
which
she
ate
with
eager
appetite
and
as
she
saw
la
teuse
still
standing
in
front
of
them
she
said
why
don
t
you
eat
something
i
shall
presently
the
old
servant
answered
my
soup
is
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
looking
with
admiration
at
the
girl
s
big
bites
she
said
to
the
priest
it
is
quite
a
pleasure
to
see
her
doesn
t
she
make
you
feel
hungry
monsieur
le
cure
you
should
force
abbe
mouret
smiled
as
he
glanced
at
his
sister
yes
yes
he
murmured
she
gets
on
famously
she
grows
fatter
every
that
s
because
i
eat
said
desiree
if
you
would
eat
you
would
get
fat
too
are
you
ill
again
you
look
very
melancholy
i
don
t
want
to
have
it
all
over
again
you
know
i
was
so
very
lonely
when
they
took
you
away
to
cure
she
is
right
said
la
teuse
you
don
t
behave
reasonably
monsieur
le
cure
you
can
t
expect
to
be
strong
living
as
you
do
on
two
or
three
crumbs
a
day
as
though
you
were
a
bird
you
don
t
make
blood
and
that
s
why
you
are
so
pale
don
t
you
feel
ashamed
of
keeping
as
thin
as
a
lath
when
we
are
so
fat
we
who
are
only
women
people
will
begin
to
think
that
we
gobble
up
everything
and
leave
you
nothing
but
the
empty
then
both
la
teuse
and
desiree
brimful
of
health
and
strength
scolded
him
affectionately
his
eyes
seemed
very
large
and
bright
but
empty
expressionless
he
was
still
gently
smiling
i
am
not
ill
he
said
i
have
nearly
finished
my
he
had
swallowed
two
mouthfuls
of
it
but
had
not
touched
the
bread
the
animals
now
said
desiree
thoughtfully
seem
to
get
on
much
more
comfortably
than
we
do
the
fowls
never
have
headaches
have
they
the
rabbits
grow
as
fat
as
ever
one
wants
them
to
be
and
you
never
saw
my
pig
looking
then
turning
towards
her
brother
she
went
on
with
an
air
of
rapture
i
have
named
it
matthew
because
it
is
so
like
that
fat
man
who
brings
the
letters
it
is
growing
so
big
and
strong
it
is
very
unkind
of
you
to
refuse
to
come
and
look
at
it
as
you
always
do
you
will
come
to
see
it
some
day
won
t
you
while
she
was
thus
talking
she
had
laid
hold
of
her
brother
s
share
of
bread
and
was
eating
away
at
it
she
had
already
finished
one
piece
and
was
beginning
the
second
when
la
teuse
became
aware
of
what
she
was
doing
that
doesn
t
belong
to
you
that
bread
you
are
actually
stealing
his
food
from
him
now
let
her
have
it
said
abbe
mouret
gently
i
shouldn
t
have
touched
it
myself
eat
it
all
my
dear
eat
it
for
a
moment
desiree
fell
into
confusion
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
bread
whilst
she
struggled
to
check
her
rising
tears
then
she
began
to
laugh
and
finished
the
slice
my
cow
said
she
continuing
her
remarks
is
never
as
sad
as
you
are
you
were
not
here
when
uncle
pascal
gave
her
to
me
on
the
promise
that
i
would
be
a
good
girl
or
you
would
have
seen
how
pleased
she
was
when
i
kissed
her
for
the
first
she
paused
to
listen
a
cock
crowed
in
the
yard
and
a
great
uproar
followed
with
flapping
of
wings
and
cackling
grunting
and
hoarse
cries
as
if
the
whole
yard
were
in
a
state
of
commotion
ah
you
know
resumed
desiree
clapping
her
hands
she
must
be
in
calf
now
i
took
her
to
the
bull
at
beage
three
leagues
from
here
there
are
very
few
bulls
hereabouts
you
la
teuse
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
glanced
at
the
priest
with
an
expression
of
annoyance
it
would
be
much
better
mademoiselle
said
she
if
you
were
to
go
and
quiet
your
fowls
they
all
seem
to
be
murdering
one
indeed
the
uproar
in
the
yard
had
now
become
so
great
that
the
girl
was
already
hurrying
off
with
a
great
rustling
of
her
petticoats
when
the
priest
called
her
back
the
milk
my
dear
you
have
not
finished
the
he
held
out
his
cup
to
her
which
he
had
scarcely
touched
and
she
came
back
and
drank
the
milk
without
the
slightest
scruple
in
spite
of
la
teuse
s
angry
look
then
she
again
set
off
for
the
where
they
soon
heard
her
reducing
the
fowls
to
peace
and
order
she
had
perhaps
sat
down
in
the
midst
of
them
for
she
could
be
heard
gently
humming
as
though
she
were
trying
to
lull
them
to
sleep
iii
now
my
soup
is
too
hot
grumbled
la
teuse
as
she
returned
from
the
kitchen
with
a
basin
from
which
a
wooden
spoon
was
projecting
she
placed
herself
just
in
front
of
abbe
mouret
and
began
to
eat
very
cautiously
from
the
edge
of
the
spoon
she
wanted
to
enliven
the
abbe
and
to
draw
him
out
of
his
melancholy
moodiness
ever
since
he
had
returned
from
the
paradou
he
had
declared
himself
well
again
and
had
never
complained
often
indeed
he
smiled
in
so
soft
and
sweet
a
fashion
that
his
fever
seemed
to
have
increased
his
saintliness
at
least
so
thought
the
villagers
but
at
intervals
he
had
fits
of
gloomy
silence
and
appeared
to
be
suffering
torture
which
he
strove
to
bear
uncomplainingly
it
was
a
mute
agony
which
bore
down
upon
him
and
for
hours
at
a
time
left
him
stupefied
a
prey
to
a
frightful
inward
struggle
the
violence
of
which
could
only
be
guessed
by
the
sweat
of
anguish
that
streamed
down
his
face
at
such
times
la
teuse
refused
to
leave
him
and
overwhelmed
him
with
a
torrent
of
gossip
until
he
had
gradually
recovered
tranquillity
by
crushing
the
rebellion
of
his
blood
on
that
particular
morning
the
old
servant
foresaw
a
more
grievous
attack
than
usual
and
poured
forth
an
amazing
flood
of
talk
while
continuing
her
wary
manoeuvres
with
the
spoon
which
threatened
to
burn
her
tongue
well
well
said
she
one
has
to
live
among
a
lot
of
wild
beasts
to
see
such
would
any
one
ever
think
in
a
decent
village
of
being
married
by
candlelight
it
shows
what
a
poor
sort
these
artauds
are
when
i
was
in
normandy
i
used
to
see
weddings
that
threw
every
one
into
commotion
for
a
couple
of
leagues
round
they
would
feast
for
three
whole
days
the
priest
would
be
there
and
the
mayor
too
and
at
the
marriage
of
one
of
my
cousins
all
the
firemen
came
as
well
and
didn
t
they
have
a
fine
time
of
it
but
to
make
a
priest
get
up
before
sunrise
and
marry
people
before
even
the
chickens
have
left
their
roost
why
there
s
no
sense
in
it
if
i
had
been
your
reverence
i
should
have
refused
to
do
it
you
haven
t
had
your
proper
sleep
and
you
may
have
caught
cold
in
the
church
it
is
that
which
has
upset
you
besides
which
it
would
be
better
to
marry
brute
beasts
than
that
rosalie
and
her
ugly
lout
that
brat
of
theirs
dirtied
one
of
the
but
you
ought
to
tell
me
when
you
feel
poorly
and
i
could
make
you
something
eh
monsieur
le
cure
speak
to
me
he
answered
in
a
feeble
voice
that
he
was
quite
well
and
only
needed
a
little
fresh
air
he
had
just
leant
against
one
of
the
and
was
breathing
rather
quickly
as
if
faint
oh
all
right
went
on
la
teuse
do
just
as
you
like
go
on
marrying
people
when
you
haven
t
the
strength
for
it
and
when
you
know
very
well
that
it
s
bound
to
upset
you
i
knew
how
it
would
be
i
told
you
so
yesterday
and
if
you
took
my
advice
you
wouldn
t
stay
where
you
are
the
smell
of
the
yard
is
bad
for
you
it
is
frightful
just
now
i
can
t
imagine
what
mademoiselle
desiree
can
be
stirring
about
there
she
s
singing
away
and
doesn
t
seem
to
mind
it
at
all
ah
that
reminds
me
of
something
i
want
to
tell
you
you
know
that
i
did
all
i
could
to
keep
her
from
taking
the
cow
to
beage
but
she
s
like
you
obstinate
and
will
go
her
own
way
fortunately
however
for
her
she
s
none
the
worse
for
it
she
delights
to
be
amongst
the
animals
and
their
young
ones
but
come
now
your
reverence
do
be
reasonable
let
me
take
you
to
your
room
you
must
lie
down
and
rest
a
little
what
you
don
t
want
to
well
then
so
much
the
worse
for
you
if
you
suffer
besides
it
s
absurd
to
keep
one
s
worries
locked
up
in
one
s
heart
till
they
stifle
then
in
her
indignation
she
hastily
swallowed
a
big
spoonful
of
soup
at
the
risk
of
burning
her
throat
she
rattled
the
handle
of
the
spoon
against
the
bowl
muttering
and
grumbling
to
herself
there
never
was
such
a
man
said
she
he
would
die
rather
than
say
a
word
but
it
s
all
very
well
for
him
to
keep
silent
i
know
quite
enough
and
it
doesn
t
require
much
cleverness
to
guess
the
rest
well
well
let
him
keep
it
to
himself
i
dare
say
it
is
la
teuse
was
jealous
pascal
had
had
a
tremendous
fight
with
her
in
order
to
get
her
patient
away
at
the
time
when
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
young
priest
s
case
would
be
quite
hopeless
if
he
should
remain
at
the
parsonage
he
had
then
explained
to
her
that
the
sound
of
the
bell
would
aggravate
and
intensify
serge
s
fever
that
the
religious
pictures
and
statuettes
scattered
about
his
room
would
fill
his
brain
with
hallucinations
and
that
entirely
new
surroundings
were
necessary
if
he
was
to
be
restored
to
health
and
strength
and
peacefulness
of
mind
she
however
had
vigorously
shaken
her
head
and
declared
that
her
dear
child
would
nowhere
find
a
better
nurse
than
herself
still
she
had
ended
by
yielding
she
had
even
resigned
herself
to
seeing
him
go
to
the
paradou
though
protesting
against
this
selection
of
the
doctor
s
which
astonished
her
but
she
retained
a
strong
feeling
of
hatred
for
the
paradou
and
she
was
hurt
by
the
silence
which
abbe
mouret
maintained
as
to
the
time
he
had
spent
there
she
had
frequently
laid
all
sorts
of
unsuccessful
traps
to
induce
him
to
talk
of
it
that
morning
exasperated
by
his
ghastly
pallor
and
his
obstinacy
in
suffering
in
silence
she
ended
by
waving
her
spoon
about
and
crying
you
should
go
back
yonder
again
monsieur
le
cure
if
you
were
so
happy
there
i
dare
say
there
is
some
one
there
who
would
nurse
you
better
than
i
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ventured
upon
a
direct
allusion
to
her
suspicions
the
blow
was
so
painful
to
the
priest
that
he
could
not
check
a
slight
cry
as
he
raised
his
countenance
at
this
la
teuse
s
kindly
heart
was
filled
with
regret
ah
she
murmured
it
is
all
the
fault
of
your
uncle
pascal
i
told
him
what
it
would
be
but
those
clever
men
cling
so
obstinately
to
their
own
ideas
some
of
them
would
kill
you
just
for
the
sake
of
rummaging
in
your
body
afterwards
it
made
me
so
angry
that
i
would
never
speak
of
it
to
any
one
yes
monsieur
le
cure
you
have
me
to
thank
that
nobody
knew
where
you
were
i
was
so
angry
about
it
i
thought
it
abominable
when
abbe
guyot
from
who
took
your
place
during
your
absence
came
to
say
mass
here
on
sundays
i
told
him
all
sorts
of
stories
i
said
you
had
gone
to
switzerland
i
don
t
even
know
where
switzerland
well
well
i
surely
don
t
want
to
say
anything
to
pain
you
but
it
was
certainly
over
yonder
that
you
got
your
trouble
very
finely
they
ve
cured
you
indeed
it
would
have
been
very
much
better
if
they
had
left
you
with
me
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
of
trying
to
turn
your
abbe
mouret
whose
brow
was
again
lowered
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
her
la
teuse
had
seated
herself
upon
the
ground
a
few
yards
away
from
him
in
order
if
possible
to
catch
his
eye
and
she
went
on
again
in
her
motherly
way
delighted
at
his
seeming
complacency
in
listening
to
her
you
would
never
let
me
tell
you
about
abbe
caffin
as
soon
as
i
began
to
speak
of
him
you
always
made
me
stop
well
well
abbe
caffin
had
had
his
troubles
in
my
part
of
the
world
at
canteleu
and
yet
he
was
a
very
holy
man
with
an
irreproachable
character
but
you
see
he
was
a
man
of
very
delicate
taste
and
liked
soft
pretty
things
well
there
was
a
young
party
who
was
always
prowling
round
him
the
daughter
of
a
miller
whom
her
parents
had
sent
to
a
well
to
put
it
shortly
what
was
likely
to
happen
did
happen
when
the
story
got
about
all
the
neighbourhood
was
very
indignant
with
the
abbe
but
he
managed
to
escape
to
rouen
and
poured
out
his
grief
to
the
archbishop
there
then
he
was
sent
here
the
poor
man
was
punished
quite
enough
by
being
made
to
live
in
this
hole
of
a
place
i
heard
of
the
girl
afterwards
she
had
married
a
and
was
very
la
teuse
delighted
at
having
been
allowed
to
tell
her
story
interpreted
the
priest
s
silence
as
an
encouragement
to
continue
her
gossiping
so
she
drew
a
little
nearer
to
him
and
said
he
was
very
friendly
with
me
was
good
monsieur
caffin
and
often
spoke
to
me
of
his
sin
it
won
t
keep
him
out
of
heaven
i
m
sure
he
can
rest
quite
peacefully
out
there
under
the
turf
for
he
never
harmed
any
one
for
my
part
i
can
t
understand
why
people
should
get
so
angry
with
a
priest
when
such
a
thing
unhappily
befalls
him
of
course
it
s
wrong
and
likely
to
anger
god
but
then
one
can
confess
and
repent
and
get
absolution
isn
t
it
so
your
reverence
that
when
one
truly
repents
one
is
saved
in
spite
of
one
s
sins
abbe
mouret
slowly
raised
his
head
by
a
supreme
effort
he
had
overcome
his
agony
and
though
his
face
was
still
very
pale
he
exclaimed
in
a
firm
voice
one
should
never
sin
never
never
ah
sir
cried
the
old
servant
you
are
too
proud
and
reserved
it
is
not
a
nice
thing
that
pride
of
if
i
were
in
your
place
i
would
not
harden
myself
like
that
i
would
talk
of
what
was
troubling
me
and
not
try
to
rend
my
heart
in
pieces
you
should
reconcile
yourself
to
the
separation
gradually
the
worry
wears
off
little
by
little
but
instead
of
that
you
won
t
even
allow
people
s
names
to
be
uttered
you
forbid
them
to
be
mentioned
it
is
as
though
they
were
dead
since
you
came
back
i
have
not
dared
to
tell
you
the
least
bit
of
news
well
well
i
am
going
to
speak
now
and
i
shall
tell
you
all
i
know
because
i
see
quite
well
that
it
is
all
this
silence
that
is
preying
upon
your
he
looked
at
her
sternly
and
lifted
his
finger
to
silence
her
yes
yes
she
went
on
i
get
news
from
over
yonder
very
often
indeed
and
i
am
going
to
tell
it
to
you
to
begin
with
there
is
some
one
there
who
is
no
happier
than
you
silence
silence
said
abbe
mouret
summoning
all
his
strength
to
rise
and
move
away
but
la
teuse
also
rose
and
barred
his
way
with
her
bulky
figure
she
was
angry
and
cried
out
there
you
see
you
want
to
be
off
already
but
you
are
going
to
listen
to
me
you
know
quite
well
that
i
am
not
over
fond
of
the
people
yonder
don
t
you
if
i
talk
to
you
about
them
it
is
for
your
own
good
some
people
say
that
i
am
jealous
well
one
day
i
mean
to
take
you
over
there
you
would
be
with
me
and
you
wouldn
t
be
afraid
of
any
harm
happening
will
you
go
he
motioned
her
away
from
him
with
his
hands
and
his
face
was
calm
again
as
he
said
i
desire
nothing
i
wish
to
know
nothing
there
is
high
mass
you
must
see
that
the
altar
is
made
then
as
he
walked
away
he
added
smiling
don
t
be
uneasy
my
good
teuse
i
am
stronger
than
you
imagine
i
shall
be
able
to
cure
myself
without
any
one
s
with
these
words
he
went
off
bearing
himself
sturdily
with
his
head
erect
for
he
had
vanquished
his
feelings
his
cassock
rustled
very
gently
against
the
borders
of
thyme
la
teuse
who
for
a
moment
had
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
where
she
was
standing
sulkily
picked
up
her
basin
and
wooden
spoon
then
shrugging
her
big
shoulders
again
and
again
she
mumbled
between
her
teeth
that
s
all
bravado
of
his
he
imagines
that
he
is
differently
made
from
other
men
just
because
he
is
a
priest
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
very
firm
and
determined
i
have
known
some
who
wouldn
t
have
had
to
be
wheedled
so
long
and
he
is
quite
capable
of
crushing
his
heart
just
as
one
might
crush
a
flea
it
must
be
the
almighty
who
gives
him
his
as
she
returned
to
the
kitchen
she
saw
abbe
mouret
standing
by
the
gate
of
the
farmyard
desiree
had
stopped
him
there
to
make
him
feel
a
capon
which
she
had
been
fattening
for
some
weeks
past
he
told
her
pleasantly
that
it
was
very
heavy
and
the
big
child
chuckled
with
glee
ah
well
said
la
teuse
in
a
fury
that
bird
has
got
to
crush
its
heart
too
but
then
it
can
t
help
iv
abbe
mouret
spent
his
days
at
the
parsonage
he
shunned
the
long
walks
which
he
had
been
wont
to
take
before
his
illness
the
scorched
soil
of
les
artaud
the
ardent
heat
of
that
valley
where
the
vines
could
never
even
grow
straight
distressed
him
on
two
occasions
in
the
morning
he
had
attempted
to
go
out
and
read
his
breviary
as
he
strolled
along
the
road
but
he
had
not
gone
beyond
the
village
he
had
returned
home
overcome
by
the
perfumes
the
heat
the
breadth
of
the
landscape
it
was
only
in
the
evening
in
the
cool
twilight
air
that
he
ventured
to
saunter
a
little
in
front
of
the
church
on
the
terrace
which
led
to
the
graveyard
in
the
afternoons
to
fill
up
his
time
and
satisfy
his
craving
for
some
kind
of
occupation
he
had
imposed
upon
himself
the
task
of
pasting
paper
over
the
broken
panes
of
the
church
windows
this
had
kept
him
for
a
week
mounted
on
a
ladder
arranging
his
paper
panes
with
great
exactness
and
laying
on
the
paste
with
the
most
scrupulous
care
in
order
to
avoid
any
mess
la
teuse
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
and
watched
him
and
desiree
urged
that
he
must
not
fill
up
all
the
windows
or
else
the
sparrows
would
no
longer
be
able
to
get
through
to
please
her
the
priest
left
a
pane
or
two
in
each
window
unfilled
then
having
completed
these
repairs
he
was
seized
with
the
ambition
of
decorating
the
church
without
summoning
to
his
aid
either
mason
or
carpenter
or
painter
he
would
do
it
all
himself
this
sort
of
handiwork
would
amuse
him
he
said
and
help
to
bring
back
his
strength
uncle
pascal
encouraged
him
every
time
he
called
at
the
parsonage
assuring
him
that
such
exercise
and
fatigue
were
better
than
all
the
drugs
in
the
world
and
so
abbe
mouret
began
to
stop
up
the
holes
in
the
walls
with
plaster
to
drive
fresh
nails
into
the
disjoined
altars
and
to
crush
and
mix
paints
in
order
that
he
might
put
a
new
coating
on
the
pulpit
and
it
was
quite
an
event
in
the
district
and
folks
talked
of
it
for
a
couple
of
leagues
round
peasants
would
come
and
stand
gazing
with
their
hands
behind
their
backs
at
his
reverence
s
work
the
abbe
himself
with
a
blue
apron
tied
round
his
waist
and
his
hands
all
soiled
with
his
labour
became
absorbed
in
it
and
used
it
as
an
excuse
for
no
longer
going
out
he
spent
his
days
in
the
midst
of
his
repairs
and
was
more
tranquil
than
he
had
been
before
almost
cheerful
indeed
as
he
forgot
the
outer
world
the
trees
and
the
sunshine
and
the
warm
breezes
which
had
formerly
disturbed
him
so
much
monsieur
le
cure
is
free
to
do
as
he
pleases
since
the
parish
hasn
t
got
to
find
the
money
said
old
bambousse
who
came
round
every
evening
to
see
how
the
work
was
progressing
abbe
mouret
spent
all
his
savings
on
it
some
of
his
decorations
indeed
were
so
awkward
that
they
would
have
excited
many
people
s
smiles
the
replastering
of
the
stonework
soon
tired
him
so
he
contented
himself
with
patching
up
the
church
walls
all
round
to
a
height
of
some
six
feet
from
the
ground
la
teuse
mixed
the
plaster
when
she
talked
of
repairing
the
parsonage
as
well
for
she
was
continually
fearing
that
it
would
topple
down
on
their
heads
he
told
her
that
he
did
not
think
he
could
manage
it
that
a
regular
workman
would
be
necessary
a
reply
which
led
to
a
terrible
quarrel
between
them
la
teuse
said
it
was
quite
ridiculous
to
go
on
ornamenting
the
church
where
nobody
slept
while
their
bedrooms
were
in
such
a
crazy
condition
for
she
was
quite
sure
they
would
all
be
found
one
morning
crushed
to
death
by
the
fallen
ceilings
i
shall
end
by
bringing
my
bed
here
and
placing
it
behind
the
altar
she
grumbled
i
feel
quite
terrified
sometimes
at
however
when
the
plaster
was
all
used
up
she
said
no
more
about
repairing
the
parsonage
the
painting
which
the
priest
executed
quite
delighted
her
it
was
the
chief
charm
of
the
improvements
the
abbe
who
had
repaired
the
woodwork
everywhere
with
bits
of
boards
took
particular
pleasure
in
spreading
his
big
brush
dipped
in
bright
yellow
paint
over
all
this
woodwork
the
gentle
motion
of
the
brush
lulled
him
left
him
thoughtless
for
hours
whilst
he
gazed
on
the
oily
streaks
of
paint
when
everything
was
quite
yellow
the
pulpit
the
the
altar
rails
even
the
itself
he
ventured
to
try
his
hand
at
imitation
marble
work
by
way
of
touching
up
the
high
altar
then
growing
bolder
he
painted
it
all
over
glistening
with
white
and
yellow
and
blue
it
was
pronounced
superb
people
who
had
not
been
to
mass
for
fifty
years
streamed
into
the
church
to
see
it
and
now
the
paint
was
dry
all
that
remained
for
abbe
mouret
to
do
was
to
edge
the
panels
with
brown
beading
so
that
afternoon
he
set
to
work
at
it
wishing
to
get
it
done
by
evening
for
on
the
following
day
as
he
had
reminded
la
teuse
there
would
be
high
mass
she
was
there
ready
to
arrange
the
altar
she
had
already
placed
on
the
credence
the
candlesticks
and
the
silver
cross
the
porcelain
vases
filled
with
artificial
roses
and
the
laced
cloth
which
was
only
used
on
great
festivals
the
beading
however
proved
so
difficult
of
execution
that
it
was
not
completed
till
late
in
the
evening
it
was
growing
quite
dark
as
the
abbe
finished
his
last
panel
it
will
be
really
too
beautiful
said
a
rough
voice
from
amidst
the
greyish
gloom
of
twilight
which
was
filling
the
church
la
teuse
who
had
knelt
down
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
abbe
s
brush
as
it
glided
along
his
rule
started
with
alarm
ah
it
s
brother
archangias
she
said
turning
round
you
came
in
by
the
sacristy
then
you
gave
me
quite
a
turn
your
voice
seemed
to
sound
from
under
the
abbe
mouret
had
resumed
his
work
after
greeting
the
brother
with
a
slight
nod
the
brother
remained
standing
there
in
silence
with
his
fat
hands
clasped
in
front
of
his
cassock
then
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
he
observed
with
what
scrupulous
care
the
priest
sought
to
make
his
beading
perfectly
straight
he
repeated
it
will
be
really
too
la
teuse
who
knelt
near
by
in
ecstasy
started
again
dear
me
she
said
i
had
quite
forgotten
you
were
there
you
really
ought
to
cough
before
you
speak
you
have
a
voice
that
comes
on
one
so
suddenly
that
one
might
think
it
was
a
voice
from
the
she
rose
up
and
drew
back
a
little
the
better
to
admire
the
abbe
s
work
why
too
beautiful
she
asked
nothing
can
be
too
beautiful
when
it
is
done
for
the
almighty
if
his
reverence
had
only
had
some
gold
he
would
have
done
it
with
gold
i
m
when
the
priest
had
finished
she
hastened
to
change
the
taking
the
greatest
care
not
to
smudge
the
beading
then
she
arranged
the
cross
the
candlesticks
and
the
vases
symmetrically
abbe
mouret
had
gone
to
lean
against
the
wooden
screen
which
separated
the
choir
from
the
nave
by
the
side
of
brother
archangias
not
a
word
passed
between
them
their
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
silver
crucifix
which
in
the
increasing
gloom
still
cast
some
glimmer
of
light
on
the
feet
and
the
left
side
and
the
right
temple
of
the
big
christ
when
la
teuse
had
finished
she
came
down
towards
them
triumphantly
doesn
t
it
look
lovely
she
asked
just
you
see
what
a
crowd
there
will
be
at
mass
those
heathens
will
only
come
to
god
s
house
when
they
think
he
is
now
monsieur
le
cure
we
must
do
as
much
for
the
blessed
virgin
s
waste
of
money
growled
brother
archangias
but
la
teuse
flew
into
a
tantrum
and
as
abbe
mouret
remained
silent
she
led
them
both
before
the
altar
of
the
virgin
pushing
them
and
dragging
them
by
their
cassocks
just
look
at
it
said
she
it
is
too
shabby
for
anything
now
that
the
high
altar
is
so
smart
it
looks
as
though
it
had
never
been
painted
at
all
however
much
i
may
rub
it
of
a
morning
the
dust
sticks
to
it
it
is
quite
black
it
is
filthy
do
you
know
what
people
will
say
about
you
your
reverence
they
will
say
that
you
care
nothing
for
the
blessed
virgin
that
s
what
they
ll
well
what
of
it
queried
brother
archangias
la
teuse
looked
at
him
half
suffocated
by
indignation
what
of
it
it
would
be
sinful
of
course
she
muttered
this
altar
is
like
a
neglected
tomb
in
a
graveyard
if
it
were
not
for
me
the
spiders
would
spin
their
webs
across
it
and
moss
would
soon
grow
over
it
from
time
to
time
when
i
can
spare
a
bunch
of
flowers
i
give
it
to
the
virgin
all
the
flowers
in
our
garden
used
to
be
for
her
she
had
mounted
the
altar
steps
and
she
took
up
two
withered
bunches
of
flowers
which
had
been
left
there
forgotten
see
it
is
just
as
it
is
in
the
graveyards
she
said
throwing
the
flowers
at
abbe
mouret
s
feet
he
picked
them
up
without
replying
it
was
quite
dark
now
and
brother
archangias
stumbled
about
amongst
the
chairs
and
nearly
fell
he
growled
and
muttered
some
angry
words
in
which
the
names
of
jesus
and
mary
recurred
when
la
teuse
who
had
gone
for
a
lamp
returned
into
the
church
she
asked
the
priest
so
i
can
put
the
brushes
and
pots
away
in
the
attic
then
yes
he
answered
i
have
finished
we
will
see
about
the
rest
later
she
walked
away
in
front
of
them
carrying
all
the
things
with
her
and
keeping
silence
lest
she
should
say
too
much
and
as
abbe
mouret
had
kept
the
withered
bunches
of
flowers
in
his
hand
brother
archangias
said
to
him
as
they
passed
the
farmyard
throw
those
things
the
abbe
took
a
few
steps
more
with
downcast
head
and
then
over
the
palings
he
flung
the
flowers
upon
a
v
the
brother
who
had
already
had
his
own
meal
seated
himself
astride
a
chair
while
the
priest
dined
since
serge
s
return
to
les
artaud
the
brother
had
thus
spent
most
of
his
evenings
at
the
parsonage
but
never
before
had
he
imposed
his
presence
upon
the
other
in
so
rough
a
fashion
he
stamped
on
the
tiled
floor
with
his
heavy
boots
his
voice
thundered
and
he
smote
the
furniture
whilst
he
related
how
he
had
whipped
some
of
his
pupils
that
morning
or
expounded
his
moral
principles
in
terms
as
stern
as
uncompromising
as
then
feeling
bored
he
suggested
that
he
and
la
teuse
should
have
a
game
at
cards
they
had
endless
bouts
of
together
that
being
the
only
game
which
la
teuse
had
ever
been
able
to
learn
abbe
mouret
would
smilingly
glance
at
the
first
few
cards
flung
on
the
table
and
would
then
gradually
sink
into
reverie
remaining
for
hours
forgetful
of
his
oblivious
of
his
surroundings
beneath
the
suspicious
glances
of
brother
archangias
that
evening
la
teuse
felt
so
cross
that
she
had
talked
of
going
to
bed
as
soon
as
the
cloth
was
removed
the
brother
however
wanted
his
game
of
cards
so
he
caught
hold
of
her
shoulders
and
sat
her
down
so
roughly
that
the
chair
creaked
beneath
her
and
forthwith
he
began
to
shuffle
the
cards
desiree
who
hated
him
had
gone
off
carrying
her
dessert
which
she
generally
took
upstairs
with
her
every
evening
to
eat
in
bed
i
want
the
red
cards
said
la
teuse
then
the
struggle
began
the
old
woman
at
first
won
some
of
the
brother
s
best
cards
but
before
long
two
aces
fell
together
on
the
table
here
s
a
battle
she
cried
wild
with
excitement
she
threw
down
a
nine
which
rather
alarmed
her
but
as
the
brother
in
his
turn
only
put
down
a
seven
she
picked
up
the
cards
with
a
triumphant
air
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
however
she
had
only
gained
two
aces
so
that
the
chances
remained
fairly
equal
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
lost
an
ace
the
knaves
and
kings
and
queens
were
perpetually
coming
and
going
as
the
battle
furiously
progressed
it
s
a
splendid
game
eh
said
brother
archangias
turning
towards
abbe
mouret
but
when
he
saw
him
sitting
there
so
absorbed
in
his
reverie
with
such
a
gentle
smile
playing
unconsciously
round
his
lips
he
roughly
raised
his
voice
why
monsieur
le
cure
you
are
not
paying
any
attention
to
us
it
isn
t
polite
of
you
we
are
only
playing
on
your
account
we
were
trying
to
amuse
you
come
and
watch
the
game
it
would
do
you
more
good
than
dozing
and
dreaming
away
there
where
were
you
just
now
the
priest
started
he
said
nothing
but
with
quivering
eyelids
tried
to
force
himself
to
look
at
the
game
the
play
went
on
vigorously
la
teuse
won
her
ace
back
and
then
lost
it
again
on
some
evenings
they
would
fight
in
this
way
over
the
aces
for
quite
four
hours
and
often
they
would
go
off
to
bed
angry
at
having
failed
to
bring
the
contest
to
a
decisive
issue
but
dear
me
i
ve
only
just
remembered
it
suddenly
cried
la
teuse
who
greatly
feared
that
she
was
going
to
be
beaten
his
reverence
has
to
go
out
he
promised
fortune
and
rosalie
that
he
would
go
to
bless
their
room
according
to
the
custom
make
haste
monsieur
le
cure
the
brother
will
go
with
abbe
mouret
had
already
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
looking
for
his
hat
but
brother
archangias
still
holding
his
cards
flew
into
a
tantrum
oh
don
t
bother
about
it
said
he
what
does
it
want
to
be
blessed
for
that
pigsty
of
theirs
it
is
a
custom
that
you
should
do
away
with
i
can
t
see
any
sense
in
it
stay
here
and
let
us
finish
the
game
that
is
much
the
best
thing
to
no
said
the
priest
i
promised
to
go
those
good
people
might
feel
hurt
if
i
didn
t
you
stay
here
and
play
your
game
out
while
you
are
waiting
for
la
teuse
glanced
uneasily
at
brother
archangias
well
yes
i
will
stay
here
cried
the
brother
it
is
really
too
but
before
abbe
mouret
could
open
the
door
he
flung
his
cards
on
the
table
and
rose
to
follow
him
then
half
turning
back
he
called
to
la
teuse
i
should
have
won
leave
the
cards
as
they
are
and
we
will
play
the
game
out
oh
they
are
all
mixed
now
answered
the
old
servant
who
had
lost
no
time
in
shuffling
them
together
did
you
suppose
that
i
was
going
to
put
your
hand
away
under
a
glass
case
and
besides
i
might
very
well
have
won
for
i
still
had
an
ace
a
few
strides
brought
brother
archangias
up
with
abbe
mouret
who
was
walking
down
the
narrow
path
that
led
to
the
village
the
brother
had
undertaken
the
task
of
keeping
watch
over
the
abbe
s
movements
he
incessantly
played
the
spy
upon
him
accompanying
him
everywhere
or
if
he
could
not
go
in
person
sending
some
school
urchin
to
follow
him
with
that
terrible
laugh
of
his
he
was
wont
to
remark
that
he
was
god
s
and
in
truth
the
abbe
seemed
like
a
culprit
ever
guarded
by
the
black
shadow
of
the
brother
s
cassock
a
culprit
to
be
treated
distrustfully
since
in
his
weakness
he
might
well
lapse
into
fresh
crime
were
he
left
free
from
surveillance
for
a
single
moment
thus
he
was
watched
and
guarded
with
all
the
spiteful
eagerness
that
some
jealous
old
maid
might
have
displayed
the
overreaching
zeal
of
a
gaoler
who
might
carry
precautions
so
far
as
to
exclude
even
such
rays
of
light
as
might
creep
through
the
chinks
of
the
brother
archangias
was
always
on
the
watch
to
keep
out
the
sunlight
to
prevent
even
a
whiff
of
air
from
entering
to
shut
up
his
prison
so
completely
that
nothing
from
outside
could
gain
access
to
it
he
noted
the
abbe
s
slightest
fits
of
weakness
and
by
his
glance
divined
his
tender
thoughts
which
with
a
word
he
pitilessly
crushed
as
though
they
were
poisonous
vermin
the
priest
s
intervals
of
silence
his
smiles
the
paling
of
his
brow
the
faint
quivering
of
his
limbs
were
all
noted
by
the
brother
but
he
never
spoke
openly
of
the
transgression
his
presence
alone
was
a
sufficient
reproach
the
manner
in
which
he
uttered
certain
words
imparted
to
them
all
the
sting
of
a
whip
stroke
with
a
mere
gesture
he
expressed
his
utter
disgust
for
the
priest
s
sin
like
one
of
those
betrayed
husbands
who
enjoy
torturing
their
wives
with
cruel
allusions
he
contented
himself
with
recalling
the
scene
at
the
paradou
in
an
indirect
fashion
by
some
word
or
phrase
which
sufficed
to
annihilate
the
abbe
whenever
the
latter
s
flesh
rebelled
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
and
most
of
the
villagers
of
les
artaud
had
retired
to
rest
but
from
a
brightly
lighted
house
at
the
far
end
near
the
mill
there
still
came
sounds
of
merriment
while
keeping
the
best
rooms
for
his
own
use
old
bambousse
had
given
a
corner
of
his
house
to
his
daughter
and
they
were
all
assembled
there
drinking
a
last
glass
while
waiting
for
the
priest
they
are
drunk
growled
brother
archangias
don
t
you
hear
the
row
they
are
making
abbe
mouret
made
no
reply
it
was
a
lovely
night
and
all
looked
bluish
in
the
moonlight
which
lent
to
the
distant
part
of
the
valley
the
aspect
of
a
sleeping
lake
the
priest
slackened
his
pace
that
he
might
the
more
fully
enjoy
the
charm
of
that
soft
radiance
and
now
and
then
he
even
stopped
as
he
came
upon
some
expanse
of
light
experiencing
the
delightful
quiver
which
the
proximity
of
fresh
water
brings
one
on
a
hot
day
but
the
brother
continued
striding
along
grumbling
and
calling
him
come
along
come
along
it
isn
t
good
to
loiter
out
of
doors
at
this
time
of
night
you
would
be
much
better
in
all
at
once
however
just
as
they
were
entering
the
village
archangias
himself
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
the
road
he
was
looking
towards
the
heights
where
the
white
lines
of
the
roads
vanished
amidst
black
patches
of
and
he
growled
to
himself
like
a
dog
that
scents
danger
who
can
be
coming
down
so
late
he
muttered
but
the
priest
who
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
was
now
in
his
turn
anxious
to
press
on
stay
stay
there
he
is
eagerly
added
brother
archangias
he
has
just
turned
the
corner
see
he
is
in
the
moonlight
now
one
can
see
him
plainly
it
is
a
tall
man
with
a
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
he
resumed
in
a
voice
husky
with
fury
it
is
he
that
beggar
i
felt
sure
it
was
thereupon
the
having
now
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
abbe
mouret
saw
that
it
was
jeanbernat
in
spite
of
his
eighty
years
the
old
man
set
his
feet
down
with
such
force
that
his
heavy
nailed
boots
sent
sparks
flying
from
the
flints
on
the
road
and
he
walked
along
as
upright
as
an
oak
without
the
aid
of
his
stick
which
he
carried
across
his
shoulder
like
a
musket
ah
the
villain
stammered
the
brother
still
standing
motionless
may
the
fiend
light
all
the
blazes
of
hell
under
his
feet
the
priest
who
felt
greatly
disturbed
and
despaired
of
inducing
his
companion
to
come
on
turned
round
to
continue
his
journey
hoping
that
by
a
quick
walk
to
the
bambousses
house
he
might
yet
manage
to
avoid
jeanbernat
but
he
had
not
taken
five
strides
before
he
heard
the
bantering
voice
of
the
old
man
close
behind
him
hie
cure
wait
for
me
are
you
afraid
of
me
and
as
abbe
mouret
stopped
he
came
up
and
continued
ah
those
cassocks
of
yours
are
tiresome
things
aren
t
they
they
prevent
your
getting
along
too
quickly
it
s
such
a
fine
clear
night
too
that
one
can
recognise
you
by
your
gown
a
long
way
off
when
i
was
right
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
said
to
myself
surely
that
is
the
little
priest
down
oh
yes
i
still
have
very
good
eyes
well
so
you
never
come
to
see
us
now
i
have
had
so
much
to
do
murmured
the
priest
who
had
turned
very
pale
well
well
every
one
s
free
to
please
himself
if
i
ve
mentioned
the
matter
it
s
only
because
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
don
t
bear
you
any
grudge
for
being
a
priest
we
wouldn
t
even
talk
about
your
religion
it
s
all
one
and
the
same
to
me
but
the
little
one
thinks
that
it
s
i
who
prevents
your
coming
i
said
to
her
the
priest
is
an
idiot
and
i
think
so
indeed
did
i
try
to
eat
you
during
your
illness
why
i
didn
t
even
go
upstairs
to
see
you
every
one
s
free
you
he
spoke
on
in
the
most
unconcerned
manner
pretending
that
he
did
not
notice
the
presence
of
brother
archangias
but
as
the
latter
suddenly
broke
into
an
angry
grunt
he
added
why
cure
so
you
bring
your
pig
out
with
you
take
care
you
bandit
hissed
the
brother
clenching
his
fists
jeanbernat
whose
stick
was
still
raised
then
pretended
to
recognise
him
hands
off
he
cried
ah
it
s
you
you
i
ought
to
have
known
you
by
your
smell
we
have
a
little
account
to
settle
together
remember
i
have
sworn
to
cut
off
your
ears
in
the
middle
of
your
school
it
will
amuse
the
children
you
are
the
brother
fell
back
before
the
raised
staff
a
flood
of
abuse
rising
to
his
lips
but
he
began
to
stammer
and
went
on
disjointedly
i
will
set
the
gendarmes
after
you
scoundrel
you
spat
on
the
church
i
saw
you
you
give
the
plague
to
the
poor
people
who
merely
pass
your
door
at
you
made
a
girl
die
by
forcing
her
to
chew
a
consecrated
wafer
which
you
had
stolen
at
beage
you
went
and
dug
up
the
bodies
of
little
dead
children
and
carried
them
away
on
your
back
you
are
an
old
sorcerer
everybody
knows
it
you
scoundrel
you
are
the
disgrace
of
the
district
whoever
strangles
you
will
gain
heaven
for
the
the
old
man
listened
with
a
sneer
twirling
the
while
his
staff
between
his
fingers
and
between
the
brother
s
successive
insults
he
ejaculated
in
an
undertone
go
on
go
on
relieve
yourself
you
viper
i
ll
break
your
back
for
you
abbe
mouret
tried
to
interfere
but
brother
archangias
pushed
him
away
exclaiming
you
are
led
by
him
yourself
didn
t
he
make
you
trample
upon
the
cross
deny
it
if
you
dare
then
again
turning
to
jeanbernat
he
yelled
ah
satan
you
must
have
chuckled
and
no
mistake
when
you
held
a
priest
in
your
grasp
may
heaven
curse
those
who
abetted
you
in
that
sacrilege
what
was
it
you
did
at
night
while
he
slept
you
came
and
moistened
his
tonsure
with
your
saliva
eh
so
that
his
hair
might
grow
more
quickly
and
then
you
breathed
upon
his
chin
and
his
cheeks
that
his
beard
might
grow
a
hand
s
breadth
in
a
single
night
and
you
rubbed
all
your
philters
into
his
body
and
breathed
into
his
mouth
the
lasciviousness
of
a
dog
you
turned
him
into
a
he
s
idiotic
said
jeanbernat
resting
his
stick
on
his
shoulder
he
quite
bores
the
brother
however
growing
bolder
thrust
his
fists
under
the
old
man
s
nose
and
that
drab
of
yours
he
cried
you
can
t
deny
that
you
set
her
on
to
damn
the
then
he
suddenly
sprang
backwards
with
a
shriek
for
the
old
man
swinging
his
stick
with
all
his
strength
had
just
broken
it
over
his
back
retreating
yet
a
little
further
archangias
picked
from
a
heap
of
stones
beside
the
road
a
piece
of
flint
twice
the
size
of
a
man
s
fist
and
threw
it
at
jeanbernat
it
would
surely
have
split
the
other
s
forehead
open
if
he
had
not
bent
down
he
however
now
likewise
crossed
over
to
a
heap
of
stones
sheltered
himself
behind
it
and
provided
himself
with
missiles
and
from
one
heap
to
the
other
a
terrible
combat
began
with
a
perfect
hail
of
flints
the
moon
now
shone
very
brightly
and
their
dark
shadows
fell
distinctly
on
the
ground
yes
yes
you
set
that
hussy
on
to
ruin
him
repeated
the
brother
wild
with
rage
ah
you
are
astonished
that
i
know
all
about
it
you
hope
for
some
monstrous
result
from
it
all
every
morning
you
make
the
thirteen
signs
of
hell
over
that
minx
of
yours
you
would
like
her
to
become
the
mother
of
antichrist
you
long
for
antichrist
you
villain
but
may
this
stone
blind
you
and
may
this
one
bung
your
mouth
up
retorted
jeanbernat
who
was
now
quite
calm
again
is
he
cracked
the
silly
fellow
with
all
those
stories
of
his
shall
i
have
to
break
your
head
for
you
before
i
can
get
on
my
way
is
it
your
catechism
that
has
turned
your
brain
catechism
indeed
do
you
know
what
catechism
is
taught
to
accursed
ones
like
you
ah
i
will
show
you
how
to
make
the
sign
of
the
this
stone
is
for
the
father
and
this
for
the
son
and
this
for
the
holy
ghost
ah
you
are
still
standing
wait
a
bit
wait
a
bit
amen
then
he
threw
a
handful
of
small
pebbles
like
a
volley
of
jeanbernat
who
was
struck
upon
the
shoulder
dropped
the
stones
he
was
holding
and
quietly
stepped
forwards
while
brother
archangias
picked
two
fresh
handfuls
from
the
heap
blurting
out
i
am
going
to
exterminate
you
it
is
god
who
wills
it
god
is
acting
through
my
will
you
be
quiet
said
the
old
man
grasping
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
then
came
a
short
struggle
amidst
the
dust
of
the
road
all
bluish
with
moonlight
the
brother
finding
himself
the
weaker
of
the
two
tried
to
bite
but
jeanbernat
s
sinewy
limbs
were
like
coils
of
rope
which
pinioned
him
so
tightly
that
he
could
almost
feel
them
cutting
into
his
flesh
he
panted
and
ceased
to
struggle
meditating
some
act
of
treachery
the
old
man
having
got
the
other
under
him
scoffingly
exclaimed
i
have
a
good
mind
to
break
one
of
your
arms
you
see
that
it
isn
t
you
who
are
the
stronger
but
that
it
is
i
who
am
exterminating
you
now
i
m
going
to
cut
your
ears
off
you
have
tried
my
endurance
too
jeanbernat
calmly
drew
his
knife
from
his
pocket
but
abbe
mouret
who
had
several
times
attempted
to
part
the
combatants
now
raised
such
strenuous
opposition
to
the
old
man
s
design
that
he
consented
to
defer
the
operation
till
another
time
you
are
acting
foolishly
cure
said
he
it
would
do
this
scoundrel
good
to
be
well
bled
but
since
it
seems
to
displease
you
i
ll
wait
a
little
longer
i
shall
be
meeting
him
again
in
some
quiet
and
as
the
brother
broke
out
into
a
growl
jeanbernat
cried
threateningly
if
you
don
t
keep
still
i
will
cut
your
ears
off
at
once
but
you
are
sitting
on
his
chest
said
the
priest
get
up
and
let
him
no
no
he
would
begin
his
tomfoolery
again
i
will
give
him
his
liberty
when
i
go
away
but
not
before
well
i
was
telling
you
cure
when
this
interrupted
us
that
you
would
be
very
welcome
yonder
the
little
one
is
mistress
you
know
i
don
t
attempt
to
interfere
with
her
any
more
than
i
do
with
my
there
are
only
fools
like
this
croaker
here
who
see
any
harm
in
it
where
did
you
see
anything
wrong
scoundrel
it
was
yourself
who
imagined
it
villain
that
you
are
and
thereupon
he
gave
the
brother
another
shaking
let
him
get
up
begged
abbe
mouret
the
little
one
has
not
been
well
for
a
long
time
i
did
not
notice
anything
myself
but
she
told
me
and
now
i
am
on
my
way
to
tell
your
uncle
pascal
at
plassans
i
like
the
night
for
walking
it
is
quiet
and
as
a
rule
one
isn
t
delayed
by
meeting
people
yes
yes
the
little
one
is
quite
the
priest
could
not
find
a
word
to
say
he
staggered
and
his
head
sank
it
made
her
so
happy
to
look
after
you
continued
the
old
man
while
i
smoked
my
pipe
i
used
to
hear
her
laugh
that
was
quite
sufficient
for
me
girls
are
like
the
hawthorns
when
they
break
out
into
blossom
they
do
all
they
can
well
now
you
will
come
if
your
heart
prompts
you
to
it
i
am
sure
it
would
please
the
little
one
good
night
he
got
up
slowly
keeping
a
firm
grasp
of
the
brother
s
wrists
to
guard
against
any
treacherous
attack
then
he
proceeded
on
his
way
with
swinging
strides
without
once
turning
his
head
the
brother
silently
crept
to
the
heap
of
stones
and
waited
till
the
old
man
was
some
distance
off
then
with
both
hands
and
with
mad
violence
he
again
began
flinging
stones
but
they
fell
harmlessly
upon
the
dusty
road
jeanbernat
did
not
condescend
to
notice
them
but
went
his
way
upright
like
a
tree
through
the
clear
night
the
accursed
one
satan
carries
him
on
shrieked
brother
archangias
as
he
hurled
his
last
stone
an
old
scoundrel
that
the
least
touch
ought
to
upset
but
he
is
baked
in
hell
s
fire
i
smelt
his
the
brother
stamped
with
impotent
rage
on
the
scattered
flints
then
he
suddenly
attacked
abbe
mouret
it
was
all
your
fault
he
cried
you
ought
to
have
helped
me
and
between
us
we
could
have
strangled
meantime
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
the
uproar
in
the
bambousses
house
had
become
greater
than
ever
the
rhythmic
tapping
of
glasses
on
a
table
could
be
distinctly
heard
the
priest
resumed
his
walk
without
raising
his
head
making
his
way
towards
the
flood
of
bright
light
that
streamed
out
of
the
window
like
the
flare
of
a
fire
of
the
brother
followed
him
gloomily
his
cassock
soiled
with
dust
and
one
of
his
cheeks
bleeding
from
a
and
after
a
short
interval
of
silence
he
asked
in
his
harsh
voice
shall
you
go
then
as
abbe
mouret
did
not
answer
he
went
on
take
care
you
are
lapsing
into
sin
again
it
was
sufficient
for
that
man
to
pass
by
to
send
a
thrill
through
your
whole
body
i
saw
you
by
the
light
of
the
moon
looking
as
pale
as
a
girl
take
care
take
care
do
you
hear
me
another
time
god
will
not
pardon
you
you
will
sink
into
the
lowest
abyss
ah
wretched
piece
of
clay
that
you
are
filth
is
mastering
you
thereupon
the
priest
at
last
raised
his
head
big
tears
were
streaming
from
his
eyes
and
it
was
in
gentle
heartbroken
accents
that
he
spoke
why
do
you
speak
to
me
like
that
you
are
always
with
me
and
you
know
my
ceaseless
struggles
do
not
doubt
me
leave
me
strength
to
master
those
simple
words
bathed
with
silent
tears
fell
on
the
night
air
with
such
an
expression
of
superhuman
suffering
that
even
brother
archangias
in
spite
of
all
his
harshness
felt
touched
he
made
no
reply
but
shook
his
dusty
cassock
and
wiped
his
bleeding
cheek
when
they
reached
the
bambousses
house
he
refused
to
go
inside
he
seated
himself
a
few
yards
away
on
the
body
of
an
overturned
cart
where
he
waited
for
the
abbe
with
patience
ah
here
is
monsieur
le
cure
cried
all
the
company
of
bambousses
and
brichets
as
serge
entered
they
filled
their
glasses
once
more
abbe
mouret
was
compelled
to
take
one
too
there
had
been
no
regular
but
in
the
evening
after
dinner
a
dame
jane
had
been
placed
upon
the
table
and
they
were
making
it
their
business
to
empty
it
before
going
to
bed
there
were
ten
of
them
and
old
bambousse
was
already
with
one
hand
tilting
over
the
jar
whence
only
a
thread
of
red
liquor
now
flowed
rosalie
in
a
very
sportive
frame
of
mind
was
dipping
her
baby
s
chin
into
her
glass
while
big
fortune
showed
off
his
strength
by
lifting
up
the
chairs
with
his
teeth
all
the
company
passed
into
the
bedroom
custom
required
that
the
priest
should
there
drink
the
glass
of
wine
which
had
been
poured
out
for
him
it
brought
good
luck
and
prevented
quarrels
in
the
household
in
monsieur
caffin
s
time
it
had
always
been
a
very
merry
ceremony
for
the
old
priest
loved
a
joke
he
had
even
gained
a
reputation
for
the
skilful
way
in
which
he
could
drain
his
glass
without
leaving
a
single
drop
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
the
artaud
women
pretended
that
every
drop
undrunk
meant
a
year
s
less
love
for
the
newly
married
pair
but
with
abbe
mouret
they
dare
not
joke
so
freely
however
he
drank
his
wine
at
one
gulp
which
seemed
to
greatly
please
old
bambousse
mother
brichet
looked
at
the
bottom
of
the
glass
and
saw
but
a
drop
or
two
of
the
liquid
remaining
there
then
after
a
few
jokes
they
all
returned
to
the
living
room
where
vincent
and
catherine
had
remained
by
themselves
vincent
standing
upon
a
chair
was
clasping
the
huge
jar
in
his
arms
and
draining
the
last
drops
of
wine
into
catherine
s
open
mouth
we
are
much
obliged
to
you
monsieur
le
cure
said
old
bambousse
as
he
escorted
the
priest
to
the
door
well
they
re
married
now
so
i
suppose
you
are
satisfied
and
they
are
not
likely
to
complain
i
m
sure
good
night
sleep
well
your
brother
archangias
had
slowly
risen
from
his
seat
on
the
old
cart
may
the
devil
pile
hot
coals
over
them
and
roast
them
he
murmured
then
without
again
opening
his
lips
he
accompanied
abbe
mouret
to
the
parsonage
and
he
waited
outside
till
the
door
was
closed
even
then
he
did
not
go
off
without
twice
looking
round
to
make
sure
that
the
abbe
was
not
coming
out
again
as
for
the
priest
when
he
reached
his
bedroom
he
threw
himself
in
his
clothes
upon
his
bed
clasping
his
hands
to
his
ears
and
pressing
his
face
to
the
pillow
in
order
that
he
might
shut
out
all
sound
and
sight
and
thus
stilling
his
senses
he
fell
into
slumber
vi
the
next
day
was
sunday
as
the
feast
of
the
exaltation
of
the
holy
cross
fell
on
a
high
mass
day
abbe
mouret
desired
to
celebrate
the
festival
with
especial
solemnity
he
was
now
full
of
extraordinary
devotion
for
the
cross
and
had
replaced
the
image
of
the
immaculate
conception
in
his
bedroom
by
a
large
crucifix
of
black
wood
before
which
he
spent
long
hours
in
worship
to
exalt
the
cross
to
plant
it
before
him
above
all
else
in
a
halo
of
glory
as
the
one
object
of
his
life
gave
him
the
strength
he
needed
to
suffer
and
to
struggle
he
sometimes
dreamed
of
hanging
there
himself
in
jesus
s
place
his
head
crowned
with
thorns
nails
driven
through
his
hands
and
feet
and
his
side
rent
by
spears
what
a
coward
he
must
be
to
complain
of
an
imaginary
wound
when
god
bled
there
from
his
whole
body
and
yet
preserved
on
his
lips
the
blessed
smile
of
the
redemption
and
however
unworthy
it
might
be
he
offered
up
his
wound
as
a
sacrifice
ended
by
falling
into
ecstasy
and
believing
that
blood
did
really
stream
from
his
brow
and
side
and
limbs
those
were
hours
of
relief
for
he
fancied
that
all
the
impurity
within
him
flowed
forth
from
his
wounds
and
he
then
usually
drew
himself
up
with
the
heroism
of
a
martyr
and
longed
to
be
called
upon
to
suffer
the
most
frightful
tortures
in
order
that
he
might
bear
them
without
a
quiver
of
the
flesh
at
early
dawn
that
day
he
knelt
before
the
crucifix
and
grace
came
upon
him
abundantly
as
dew
he
made
no
effort
he
simply
fell
upon
his
knees
to
receive
it
in
his
heart
to
be
permeated
with
it
to
the
marrow
of
his
bones
in
sweetest
and
most
refreshing
fulness
on
the
previous
day
he
had
prayed
for
grace
in
agony
and
it
had
not
come
at
times
it
long
remained
deaf
to
his
entreaties
and
then
when
he
simply
clasped
his
hands
in
quite
childlike
fashion
it
flowed
down
to
succour
him
it
came
upon
him
that
morning
like
a
benediction
bringing
perfect
serenity
absolute
trusting
faith
he
forgot
his
anguish
of
the
previous
days
and
surrendered
himself
wholly
to
the
triumphant
joy
of
the
cross
he
seemed
to
be
cased
in
such
impenetrable
armour
that
the
world
s
most
deadly
blows
would
glide
off
from
it
harmlessly
when
he
came
down
from
his
bedroom
he
stepped
along
with
an
air
of
serenity
and
victory
la
teuse
was
astonished
and
went
to
find
desiree
that
he
might
kiss
her
and
both
of
them
clapped
their
hands
and
said
that
they
had
not
seen
him
looking
so
well
for
the
last
six
months
but
it
was
in
the
church
at
high
mass
that
the
priest
felt
that
he
had
really
recovered
divine
grace
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
approached
the
altar
with
such
loving
emotion
and
he
had
to
make
a
great
effort
to
restrain
himself
from
weeping
whilst
he
remained
with
his
lips
pressed
to
the
it
was
a
solemn
high
mass
the
local
rural
guard
an
uncle
of
rosalie
chanted
in
a
deep
bass
voice
which
rumbled
through
the
low
nave
like
a
hoarse
organ
vincent
robed
in
a
surplice
much
too
large
for
him
which
had
formerly
belonged
to
abbe
caffin
carried
an
old
silver
censer
and
was
vastly
amused
by
the
tinkling
of
its
chains
he
swung
it
to
a
great
height
so
as
to
produce
copious
clouds
of
smoke
and
glanced
behind
him
every
now
and
then
to
see
if
he
had
succeeded
in
making
any
one
cough
the
church
was
almost
full
for
everybody
wanted
to
see
his
reverence
s
painting
peasant
women
laughed
with
pleasure
because
the
place
smelt
so
nice
while
the
men
standing
under
the
gallery
jerked
their
heads
approvingly
at
each
deeper
and
deeper
note
that
came
from
the
rural
guard
filtering
through
the
paper
window
panes
the
full
morning
sun
lighted
up
the
brightly
painted
walls
on
which
the
women
s
caps
cast
shadows
resembling
huge
butterflies
the
artificial
flowers
with
which
the
altar
was
decorated
almost
seemed
to
possess
the
moist
freshness
of
natural
ones
newly
gathered
and
when
the
priest
turned
round
to
bless
the
congregation
he
felt
even
stronger
emotion
than
before
as
he
saw
his
church
so
clean
so
full
and
so
steeped
in
music
and
incense
and
light
after
the
offertory
however
a
buzzing
murmur
sped
through
the
peasant
women
vincent
inquisitively
turned
his
head
and
in
doing
so
almost
let
the
charcoal
in
his
censer
fall
upon
the
priest
s
chasuble
and
wishing
to
excuse
himself
as
he
saw
the
abbe
looking
at
him
with
an
expression
of
reproof
he
murmured
it
is
your
reverence
s
uncle
who
has
just
come
at
the
end
of
the
church
standing
beside
one
of
the
slender
wooden
pillars
that
supported
the
gallery
abbe
mouret
then
perceived
doctor
pascal
the
doctor
was
not
wearing
his
usual
cheerful
and
slightly
scoffing
expression
hat
in
hand
he
stood
there
looking
very
grave
and
followed
the
service
with
evident
impatience
the
sight
of
the
priest
at
the
altar
his
solemn
demeanour
his
slow
gestures
and
the
perfect
serenity
of
his
countenance
appeared
to
gradually
increase
his
irritation
he
could
not
stay
there
till
the
end
of
the
mass
but
left
the
church
and
walked
up
and
down
beside
his
horse
and
gig
which
he
had
secured
to
one
of
the
parsonage
shutters
will
that
nephew
of
mine
never
have
finished
censing
himself
he
asked
of
la
teuse
who
was
just
coming
out
of
the
vestry
it
is
all
over
she
replied
won
t
you
come
into
the
his
reverence
is
unrobing
he
knows
you
are
well
unless
he
were
blind
he
couldn
t
very
well
help
it
growled
the
doctor
as
he
followed
la
teuse
into
the
stiffly
furnished
chamber
which
she
pompously
called
the
here
for
a
few
minutes
he
paced
up
and
down
the
gloomy
coldness
of
his
surroundings
seemed
to
increase
his
irritation
as
he
strode
about
flourishing
a
stick
he
carried
he
kept
on
striking
the
of
horsehair
which
sounded
hard
and
dead
as
stone
then
tired
of
walking
he
took
his
stand
in
front
of
the
mantelpiece
in
the
centre
of
which
a
gaudily
painted
image
of
saint
joseph
occupied
the
place
of
a
clock
ah
here
he
comes
at
last
he
said
as
he
heard
the
door
opening
and
stepping
towards
the
abbe
he
went
on
do
you
know
that
you
made
me
listen
to
half
a
mass
it
is
a
very
long
time
since
that
happened
to
me
but
i
was
bent
on
seeing
you
i
have
something
to
say
to
then
he
stopped
and
looked
at
the
priest
with
an
expression
of
surprise
silence
fell
you
at
all
events
are
quite
well
he
resumed
in
a
different
voice
yes
i
am
very
much
better
than
i
was
replied
abbe
mouret
with
a
smile
i
did
not
expect
you
before
thursday
sunday
isn
t
your
day
for
coming
is
there
something
you
want
to
tell
me
uncle
pascal
did
not
give
an
immediate
answer
he
went
on
looking
at
the
abbe
the
latter
was
still
fresh
from
the
influence
of
the
church
and
the
mass
his
hair
was
fragrant
with
the
perfume
of
the
incense
and
in
his
eyes
shone
all
the
joy
of
the
cross
his
uncle
jogged
his
head
as
he
noticed
that
expression
of
triumphant
peace
i
have
come
from
the
paradou
he
said
abruptly
jeanbernat
came
to
fetch
me
there
i
have
seen
albine
and
she
disquiets
me
she
needs
much
careful
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
priest
as
he
spoke
but
he
did
not
detect
so
much
as
a
quiver
of
serge
s
eyelids
she
took
great
care
of
you
you
know
he
added
more
roughly
without
her
my
boy
you
might
now
be
in
one
of
the
cells
at
les
tulettes
with
a
strait
waistcoat
on
well
i
promised
that
you
would
go
to
see
her
i
will
take
you
with
me
it
will
be
a
farewell
meeting
she
is
anxious
to
go
i
can
do
nothing
more
than
pray
for
the
person
of
whom
you
speak
said
abbe
mouret
softly
and
as
the
doctor
losing
his
temper
brought
his
stick
down
heavily
upon
the
couch
he
added
calmly
but
in
a
firm
voice
i
am
a
priest
and
can
only
help
with
ah
well
yes
you
are
right
said
uncle
pascal
dropping
down
into
an
armchair
it
is
i
who
am
an
old
fool
yes
i
wept
like
a
child
as
i
came
here
alone
in
my
gig
that
is
what
comes
of
living
amongst
books
one
learns
a
lot
from
them
but
one
makes
a
fool
of
oneself
in
the
world
how
could
i
guess
that
it
would
all
turn
out
so
badly
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
began
to
walk
about
again
looking
exceedingly
troubled
but
yes
but
yes
i
ought
to
have
guessed
it
was
all
quite
natural
though
with
one
in
your
position
it
was
bound
to
be
abominable
you
are
not
as
other
men
but
listen
to
me
i
assure
you
that
otherwise
you
would
never
have
recovered
it
was
she
alone
with
the
atmosphere
she
set
round
you
who
saved
you
from
madness
there
is
no
need
for
me
to
tell
you
what
a
state
you
were
in
it
is
one
of
my
most
wonderful
cures
but
i
can
t
take
any
pride
any
pleasure
in
it
for
now
the
poor
girl
is
dying
of
it
abbe
mouret
remained
there
erect
perfectly
calm
his
face
reflecting
all
the
quiet
serenity
of
a
martyr
whom
nothing
that
man
might
do
could
disturb
god
will
take
mercy
upon
her
he
said
god
god
muttered
the
doctor
below
his
breath
ah
he
would
do
better
not
to
interfere
we
might
manage
matters
if
we
were
left
to
then
raising
his
voice
he
added
i
thought
i
had
considered
everything
carefully
that
is
the
most
wonderful
part
of
it
oh
what
a
fool
i
was
you
would
stay
there
i
thought
for
a
month
to
recover
your
strength
the
shade
of
the
trees
the
cheerful
chatter
of
the
girl
all
the
youthfulness
about
you
would
quickly
bring
you
round
and
then
you
on
your
side
it
seemed
to
me
would
do
something
to
reclaim
the
poor
child
from
her
wild
ways
you
would
civilise
her
and
between
us
we
should
turn
her
into
a
young
lady
for
whom
we
should
find
a
suitable
husband
it
seemed
such
a
perfect
scheme
and
then
how
was
i
to
guess
that
old
philosophising
jeanbernat
would
never
stir
an
inch
from
his
well
well
i
myself
never
left
my
own
laboratory
i
had
such
pressing
work
there
and
it
is
all
my
fault
ah
i
am
a
stupid
bungler
he
was
choking
and
wished
to
go
off
and
he
began
to
look
about
him
for
his
hat
though
all
the
while
he
had
it
on
his
head
he
stammered
i
am
going
so
you
won
t
come
do
now
for
my
sake
you
see
how
miserable
how
upset
i
am
i
swear
to
you
that
she
shall
go
away
immediately
afterwards
that
is
all
settled
my
gig
is
here
you
might
be
back
in
an
hour
come
do
come
i
beg
the
priest
made
a
sweeping
gesture
such
a
gesture
as
the
doctor
had
seen
him
make
before
the
altar
no
he
said
i
can
not
then
as
he
accompanied
his
uncle
out
of
the
room
he
added
tell
her
to
fall
on
her
knees
and
pray
to
god
god
will
hear
her
as
he
heard
me
and
he
will
comfort
her
as
he
has
comforted
me
there
is
no
other
means
of
the
doctor
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
repeated
you
are
quite
well
now
and
have
no
further
need
of
but
as
he
was
unfastening
his
horse
desiree
who
had
heard
his
voice
came
running
up
she
was
extremely
attached
to
her
uncle
when
she
had
been
younger
he
had
been
wont
to
listen
to
her
childish
prattle
for
hours
without
showing
the
least
sign
of
weariness
and
even
now
he
did
his
best
to
spoil
her
and
manifested
the
greatest
interest
in
her
farmyard
often
spending
a
whole
afternoon
with
her
amongst
her
fowls
and
ducks
and
smiling
at
her
with
his
bright
eyes
he
seemed
to
consider
her
superior
to
other
girls
and
so
she
now
flung
herself
round
his
neck
in
an
impulse
of
affection
and
cried
aren
t
you
going
to
stay
and
have
some
lunch
with
us
but
having
kissed
her
he
said
he
could
not
remain
and
unfastened
her
arms
from
his
neck
with
a
somewhat
pettish
air
she
laughed
however
and
again
clasped
her
arms
round
him
oh
but
you
must
she
persisted
i
have
some
eggs
that
have
only
just
been
laid
i
have
been
looking
in
the
nests
and
there
are
fourteen
eggs
this
morning
and
if
you
will
stay
we
can
have
a
fowl
the
white
one
that
is
always
quarrelling
with
the
others
when
you
were
here
on
thursday
you
know
it
pecked
the
big
spotted
hen
s
eye
but
her
uncle
persisted
in
his
refusal
he
was
irritated
to
find
that
he
could
not
unfasten
the
knot
in
which
he
had
tied
his
reins
and
then
she
began
to
skip
round
him
clapping
her
hands
and
repeating
in
a
voice
yes
yes
you
ll
stay
and
we
will
eat
it
up
we
ll
eat
it
up
her
uncle
could
no
longer
resist
her
blandishments
he
raised
his
head
and
smiled
at
her
she
seemed
so
full
of
life
and
health
and
sincerity
her
gaiety
was
as
frank
and
natural
as
the
sheet
of
sunlight
which
was
gilding
her
bare
arms
you
big
silly
he
said
and
clasping
her
by
the
wrists
as
she
continued
skipping
gleefully
about
him
he
went
on
no
dear
not
i
have
to
go
to
see
a
poor
girl
who
is
ill
but
i
will
come
some
other
morning
i
promise
you
when
when
she
persisted
on
thursday
the
cow
is
in
calf
you
know
and
she
hasn
t
seemed
at
all
well
these
last
two
days
you
are
a
doctor
and
you
ought
to
be
able
to
give
her
something
to
do
her
abbe
mouret
who
had
calmly
remained
there
could
not
restrain
a
slight
laugh
the
doctor
gaily
got
into
his
gig
and
exclaimed
all
right
my
dear
i
will
attend
to
your
cow
come
and
let
me
kiss
you
ah
how
nice
and
healthy
you
are
and
you
are
worth
more
than
all
the
others
put
together
ah
if
every
one
was
like
my
big
silly
this
earth
would
be
too
beautiful
he
set
his
horse
off
with
a
cluck
of
his
tongue
and
continued
talking
to
himself
as
the
gig
rattled
down
the
hill
yes
yes
there
should
be
nothing
but
animals
ah
if
they
were
mere
animals
how
happy
and
gay
and
strong
they
would
all
be
it
has
gone
well
with
the
girl
who
is
as
happy
as
her
cow
but
it
has
gone
badly
with
the
lad
who
is
in
torture
beneath
his
cassock
a
drop
too
much
blood
a
little
too
much
nerve
and
one
s
whole
life
is
wrecked
they
are
true
rougons
and
true
macquarts
those
children
there
the
of
the
stock
its
final
then
urging
on
his
horse
he
drove
at
a
trot
up
the
hill
that
led
to
the
paradou
vii
sunday
was
a
busy
day
for
abbe
mouret
he
had
to
think
of
vespers
which
he
generally
said
to
empty
seats
for
even
mother
brichet
did
not
carry
her
piety
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
church
in
the
afternoon
then
at
four
o
clock
brother
archangias
brought
the
little
rogues
from
his
school
to
repeat
their
catechism
to
his
reverence
this
lesson
sometimes
lasted
until
late
when
the
children
showed
themselves
quite
intractable
la
teuse
was
summoned
to
frighten
them
with
her
broom
on
that
particular
sunday
about
four
o
clock
desiree
found
herself
quite
alone
in
the
parsonage
as
she
felt
a
little
bored
she
went
to
gather
some
food
for
her
rabbits
in
the
churchyard
where
there
were
some
magnificent
poppies
of
which
rabbits
are
extremely
fond
dragging
herself
about
on
her
knees
between
the
she
gathered
apronfuls
of
juicy
verdure
on
which
her
pets
fell
greedily
oh
what
lovely
plantains
she
muttered
stooping
before
abbe
caffin
s
tombstone
and
delighted
with
the
discovery
she
had
made
there
were
indeed
some
magnificent
plantains
spreading
out
their
broad
leaves
beside
the
stone
desiree
had
just
finished
filling
her
apron
with
them
when
she
fancied
she
heard
a
strange
noise
behind
her
a
rustling
of
branches
and
a
rolling
of
small
pebbles
came
from
the
ravine
which
skirted
one
side
of
the
graveyard
and
at
the
bottom
of
which
flowed
the
mascle
a
stream
which
descended
from
the
high
lands
of
the
paradou
but
the
ascent
here
was
so
rough
so
impracticable
that
desiree
imagined
that
the
noise
could
only
have
been
made
by
some
lost
dog
or
straying
goat
she
stepped
quickly
to
the
edge
and
as
she
looked
over
she
was
amazed
to
see
amidst
the
brambles
a
girl
who
was
climbing
up
the
rocks
with
extraordinary
agility
i
will
give
you
a
hand
she
said
you
might
easily
break
your
neck
the
girl
directly
she
saw
she
was
discovered
started
back
as
though
she
would
rather
go
down
again
but
after
a
moment
s
hesitation
she
ventured
to
take
the
hand
that
was
held
out
to
her
oh
i
know
who
you
are
said
desiree
with
a
beaming
smile
and
letting
her
apron
fall
that
she
might
grasp
the
girl
by
the
waist
you
once
gave
me
some
blackbirds
but
they
all
died
poor
little
dears
i
was
so
sorry
about
wait
a
bit
i
know
your
name
i
have
heard
it
before
la
teuse
often
mentions
it
when
serge
isn
t
there
but
she
told
me
that
i
was
not
to
repeat
it
wait
a
moment
i
shall
remember
it
directly
she
tried
to
recall
the
name
and
grew
quite
grave
in
the
attempt
then
having
succeeded
in
remembering
it
she
became
gay
again
and
seemingly
found
great
pleasure
in
dwelling
upon
its
musical
sound
albine
albine
what
a
sweet
name
it
is
at
first
i
used
to
think
you
must
be
a
tomtit
because
i
once
had
a
tomtit
with
a
name
very
like
yours
though
i
don
t
remember
exactly
what
it
albine
did
not
smile
her
face
was
very
pale
and
there
was
a
feverish
gleam
in
her
eyes
a
few
drops
of
blood
trickled
from
her
hands
when
she
had
recovered
her
breath
she
hastily
exclaimed
no
no
leave
it
alone
you
will
only
stain
your
handkerchief
it
is
nothing
but
a
scratch
i
didn
t
want
to
come
by
the
road
as
i
should
have
been
seen
so
i
preferred
coming
along
the
bed
of
the
torrent
is
serge
there
desiree
did
not
feel
at
all
shocked
at
hearing
the
girl
pronounce
her
brother
s
name
thus
familiarly
and
with
an
expression
of
subdued
passion
she
simply
replied
that
he
was
in
the
church
hearing
the
children
say
their
catechism
you
must
not
speak
at
all
loudly
she
added
raising
her
finger
to
her
lips
serge
forbade
me
to
talk
loudly
when
he
is
catechising
the
children
and
we
shall
get
into
trouble
if
we
don
t
keep
quiet
let
us
go
into
the
stable
shall
we
we
can
talk
better
i
want
to
see
serge
said
albine
simply
desiree
cast
a
hasty
glance
at
the
church
and
then
whispered
yes
yes
serge
will
be
finely
caught
come
with
me
we
will
hide
ourselves
and
keep
quite
quiet
we
shall
have
some
fine
fun
she
had
picked
up
the
herbage
which
had
fallen
from
her
apron
and
quitting
the
graveyard
she
stole
back
to
the
parsonage
telling
albine
to
hide
herself
behind
her
and
make
herself
as
little
as
possible
as
they
stealthily
glided
through
the
farmyard
they
caught
sight
of
la
teuse
who
was
crossing
over
to
the
vestry
but
she
did
not
appear
to
notice
them
there
there
said
desiree
quite
delighted
as
they
stowed
themselves
away
in
the
stable
keep
quiet
and
no
one
will
know
that
we
are
here
there
is
some
straw
there
for
you
to
lie
down
albine
seated
herself
on
a
truss
of
straw
and
serge
she
asked
persisting
in
her
one
fixed
idea
listen
you
can
hear
his
voice
when
he
claps
his
hands
it
will
be
all
over
and
the
children
will
go
away
listen
he
is
telling
them
a
they
could
indeed
just
hear
abbe
mouret
s
voice
which
was
wafted
to
them
through
the
vestry
doorway
which
la
teuse
had
doubtless
left
open
it
came
to
them
like
a
solemn
murmur
in
which
they
could
distinguish
the
name
of
jesus
thrice
repeated
albine
trembled
she
sprang
up
as
though
to
hasten
to
that
beloved
voice
whose
caressing
accents
she
knew
so
well
but
all
sound
of
it
suddenly
died
away
shut
off
by
the
closing
of
the
door
then
she
sat
down
again
to
wait
her
hands
tightly
clasped
and
her
clear
eyes
gleaming
with
the
intensity
of
her
thoughts
desiree
who
was
lying
at
her
feet
gazed
up
at
her
with
innocent
admiration
how
beautiful
you
are
she
whispered
you
are
like
an
image
that
serge
used
to
have
in
his
bedroom
it
was
quite
white
like
you
are
with
great
curls
floating
about
the
neck
and
the
heart
was
quite
bare
and
uncovered
just
in
the
place
where
i
can
feel
yours
beating
but
you
are
not
listening
to
me
you
are
looking
quite
sad
let
us
play
at
something
will
you
then
she
stopped
short
holding
her
breath
and
saying
between
her
teeth
ah
the
wretches
they
will
get
us
caught
she
still
had
her
apron
full
of
herbage
with
her
and
her
pets
were
taking
it
by
assault
a
troop
of
fowls
had
surrounded
her
clucking
and
calling
each
other
and
pecking
at
the
hanging
green
stuff
the
goat
pushed
its
head
slyly
under
her
arm
and
began
to
eat
the
longer
leaves
even
the
cow
which
was
tethered
to
the
wall
strained
at
its
cord
and
poked
out
its
nose
kissing
her
with
its
warm
breath
oh
you
thieves
cried
desiree
but
this
is
for
the
rabbits
not
for
you
leave
me
alone
won
t
you
you
there
will
get
your
ears
boxed
if
you
don
t
go
away
and
you
too
will
have
your
tail
pulled
if
i
catch
you
at
it
again
the
wretches
they
will
be
eating
my
hands
soon
she
drove
the
goat
off
dispersed
the
fowls
with
her
feet
and
tapped
the
cow
s
nose
with
her
fists
but
the
creatures
just
shook
themselves
and
then
came
back
more
greedily
than
ever
surrounding
her
jumping
on
her
and
tearing
open
her
apron
at
this
she
whispered
to
albine
as
though
she
were
afraid
the
animals
might
hear
her
aren
t
they
amusing
the
dears
watch
them
albine
looked
on
with
a
grave
expression
now
now
be
good
resumed
desiree
you
shall
all
have
some
but
you
must
wait
your
turns
now
big
lisa
you
first
eh
how
fond
you
are
of
plantain
aren
t
you
big
lisa
was
the
cow
she
slowly
munched
a
handful
of
the
juicy
leaves
which
had
grown
beside
abbe
caffin
s
tomb
a
thread
of
saliva
hung
down
from
her
mouth
and
her
great
brown
eyes
shone
with
quiet
enjoyment
there
now
it
s
your
turn
continued
desiree
turning
towards
the
goat
you
are
fond
of
poppies
i
know
and
you
like
the
flowers
best
don
t
you
the
buds
that
shine
in
your
teeth
like
butterflies
see
here
are
some
splendid
ones
they
came
from
the
corner
where
there
was
a
burial
last
as
she
spoke
she
gave
the
goat
a
bunch
of
scarlet
flowers
which
the
animal
ate
from
her
hand
when
there
was
nothing
left
in
her
grasp
but
the
stalks
she
pushed
these
between
its
teeth
behind
her
in
the
meanwhile
the
fowls
were
desperately
pecking
away
at
her
petticoats
she
threw
them
some
wild
chicory
and
dandelions
which
she
had
gathered
amongst
the
old
slabs
that
were
ranged
alongside
the
church
walls
it
was
particularly
over
the
dandelions
that
the
fowls
quarrelled
so
voraciously
indeed
with
such
scratchings
and
flapping
of
wings
that
the
other
fowls
in
the
yard
heard
them
and
then
came
a
general
invasion
the
big
yellow
cock
alexander
was
the
first
to
appear
having
seized
a
dandelion
and
torn
it
in
halves
without
attempting
to
eat
it
he
called
to
the
hens
who
were
still
outside
to
come
and
peck
then
a
white
hen
strutted
in
then
a
black
one
and
then
a
whole
crowd
of
hens
who
hustled
one
another
and
trod
on
one
another
s
tails
and
ended
by
forming
a
wild
flood
of
feathers
behind
the
fowls
came
the
pigeons
and
the
ducks
and
the
geese
and
last
of
all
the
turkeys
desiree
laughed
at
seeing
herself
thus
surrounded
by
this
noisy
squabbling
mob
this
is
what
always
happens
said
she
every
time
that
i
bring
any
green
stuff
from
the
graveyard
they
nearly
kill
each
other
to
get
at
it
they
must
find
it
very
then
she
made
a
fight
to
keep
a
few
handfuls
of
the
leaves
from
the
greedy
beaks
which
rose
all
round
her
saying
that
something
must
really
be
saved
for
the
rabbits
she
would
surely
get
angry
with
them
if
they
went
on
like
that
and
give
them
nothing
but
dry
bread
in
future
however
she
was
obliged
to
give
way
the
geese
tugged
at
her
apron
so
violently
that
she
was
almost
pulled
down
upon
her
knees
the
ducks
gobbled
away
at
her
ankles
two
of
the
pigeons
flew
upon
her
head
and
some
of
the
fowls
fluttered
about
her
shoulders
it
was
the
ferocity
of
creatures
who
smell
flesh
the
fat
plantains
the
crimson
poppies
the
milky
dandelions
in
which
remained
some
of
the
life
of
the
dead
desiree
laughed
loudly
and
felt
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
slipping
down
and
letting
go
of
her
last
two
handfuls
when
the
fowls
were
by
a
terrible
grunting
ah
it
s
you
my
fatty
she
exclaimed
quite
delighted
eat
them
up
and
set
me
at
the
pig
waddled
in
he
was
no
longer
the
little
pig
of
former
days
pink
as
a
newly
painted
toy
with
a
tiny
little
tail
like
a
bit
of
string
but
a
fat
wobbling
creature
fit
to
be
killed
with
a
belly
as
round
as
a
monk
s
and
a
back
all
bristling
with
rough
hairs
that
reeked
of
fatness
his
stomach
had
grown
quite
yellow
from
his
habit
of
sleeping
on
the
manure
heap
waddling
along
on
his
shaky
feet
he
charged
with
lowered
snout
at
the
scared
fowls
and
so
left
desiree
at
liberty
to
escape
and
take
the
rabbits
the
few
scraps
of
green
stuff
which
she
had
so
strenuously
defended
when
she
came
back
all
was
peace
again
the
stupid
geese
were
lazily
swaying
their
long
necks
about
the
ducks
and
turkeys
were
waddling
in
ungainly
fashion
alongside
the
wall
the
fowls
were
quietly
clucking
and
peaking
at
invisible
grains
on
the
hard
ground
of
the
stable
while
the
pig
the
goat
and
the
big
cow
were
drowsily
blinking
their
eyes
as
though
they
were
falling
asleep
outside
it
had
just
begun
to
rain
ah
well
there
s
a
shower
coming
on
cried
desiree
throwing
herself
down
on
the
straw
you
had
better
stay
where
you
are
my
dears
if
you
don
t
want
to
get
then
she
turned
to
albine
and
added
how
stupid
they
all
look
don
t
they
they
only
wake
up
just
to
eat
albine
still
remained
silent
the
merry
laughter
of
that
buxom
girl
as
she
struggled
amidst
those
greedy
necks
and
gluttonous
beaks
which
tickled
and
kissed
her
and
seemed
bent
on
devouring
her
very
flesh
had
rendered
the
unhappy
daughter
of
the
paradou
yet
paler
than
she
had
been
before
so
much
gaiety
so
much
vitality
so
much
boisterous
health
made
her
despair
she
strained
her
feverish
arms
to
her
desolate
bosom
which
desertion
had
parched
and
serge
she
asked
again
in
the
same
clear
stubborn
voice
hush
said
desiree
i
heard
him
just
now
he
hasn
t
finished
yet
we
have
been
making
a
pretty
disturbance
la
teuse
must
surely
have
grown
deaf
this
afternoon
let
us
keep
quiet
now
i
like
to
hear
the
rain
the
shower
beat
in
at
the
open
doorway
casting
big
drops
upon
the
threshold
the
restless
fowls
after
venturing
out
for
a
moment
had
quickly
retreated
to
the
far
end
of
the
stable
where
indeed
with
the
exception
of
three
ducks
who
remained
quietly
walking
in
the
rain
all
the
pets
had
now
taken
refuge
clustering
round
the
girl
s
skirts
it
was
growing
very
warm
amongst
the
straw
desiree
pulled
two
big
trusses
together
made
a
bed
of
them
and
lay
down
at
full
length
she
felt
extremely
comfortable
there
it
is
so
nice
she
murmured
come
and
lie
down
like
me
it
is
so
springy
and
soft
all
this
straw
and
it
tickles
one
so
funnily
in
the
neck
do
you
roll
about
in
the
straw
at
home
there
is
nothing
i
am
fonder
of
sometimes
i
tickle
the
soles
of
my
feet
with
it
that
is
very
funny
too
but
at
that
moment
the
big
yellow
cock
who
had
been
gravely
stalking
towards
her
jumped
upon
her
breast
get
away
with
you
alexander
get
away
she
cried
what
a
tiresome
creature
he
is
the
idea
of
his
perching
himself
on
me
you
are
too
rough
sir
and
you
scratch
me
with
your
claws
do
you
hear
me
i
don
t
want
you
to
go
away
but
you
must
be
good
and
mustn
t
peck
at
my
then
she
troubled
herself
no
further
about
him
the
cock
still
maintained
his
position
every
now
and
then
glancing
inquisitively
at
the
girl
s
chin
with
his
gleaming
eye
the
other
birds
all
began
to
cluster
round
her
after
rolling
amongst
the
straw
she
was
now
lying
lazily
on
her
back
with
her
arms
stretched
out
ah
how
pleasant
it
is
she
said
but
then
it
makes
me
feel
so
sleepy
straw
always
makes
one
drowsy
doesn
t
it
serge
doesn
t
like
it
perhaps
you
don
t
either
what
do
you
like
tell
me
so
that
i
may
she
was
gradually
dozing
off
for
a
moment
she
opened
her
eyes
widely
as
though
she
were
looking
for
something
and
then
her
eyelids
fell
with
a
tranquil
smile
of
content
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
but
after
a
few
minutes
she
opened
her
eyes
again
and
said
the
cow
is
going
to
have
a
calf
that
will
be
so
nice
and
will
please
me
more
than
then
she
sank
into
deep
slumber
the
fowls
had
ended
by
perching
on
her
body
she
was
buried
beneath
a
wave
of
living
plumage
hens
were
brooding
over
her
feet
geese
stretched
their
soft
downy
necks
over
her
legs
the
pig
lay
against
her
left
side
while
on
the
right
the
goat
poked
its
bearded
head
under
her
arm
the
pigeons
were
roosting
and
nestling
all
over
her
on
her
hands
her
waist
and
her
shoulders
and
there
she
lay
asleep
in
all
her
rosy
freshness
caressed
by
the
cow
s
warm
breath
while
the
big
cock
still
squatted
just
below
her
bosom
with
gleaming
comb
and
quivering
wings
outside
the
rain
was
falling
less
heavily
a
sunbeam
escaping
from
beneath
a
cloud
gilded
the
fine
drops
of
water
albine
who
had
remained
perfectly
still
watched
the
slumber
of
desiree
that
big
plump
girl
who
found
her
great
delight
in
rolling
about
in
the
straw
she
wished
that
she
too
could
slumber
away
so
peacefully
and
feel
such
pleasure
because
a
few
straws
had
tickled
her
neck
and
she
felt
jealous
of
those
strong
arms
that
firm
bosom
all
that
vitality
all
that
purely
animal
development
which
made
the
other
like
a
tranquil
sister
of
the
big
red
and
white
cow
however
the
rain
had
now
quite
ceased
the
three
cats
of
the
parsonage
filed
out
into
the
yard
one
after
the
other
keeping
close
to
the
wall
and
taking
the
greatest
precautions
to
avoid
wetting
their
paws
they
peeped
into
the
stable
and
then
stalked
up
to
the
sleeping
girl
and
lay
down
purring
close
by
her
moumou
the
big
black
cat
curled
itself
up
close
to
her
cheek
and
gently
licked
her
chin
and
serge
murmured
albine
quite
mechanically
what
was
it
that
kept
them
apart
who
was
it
that
prevented
them
from
being
happy
together
why
might
she
not
love
him
and
why
might
she
not
be
loved
freely
and
in
the
broad
sunlight
as
the
trees
lived
and
loved
she
knew
not
but
she
felt
that
she
had
been
forsaken
and
had
received
a
mortal
wound
yet
she
was
possessed
by
a
stubborn
determined
longing
a
very
necessity
indeed
of
once
more
clasping
her
love
in
her
arms
of
concealing
him
somewhere
that
he
might
be
hers
in
all
felicity
she
rose
to
her
feet
the
vestry
door
had
just
been
opened
again
a
clapping
of
hands
sounded
followed
by
the
uproar
of
a
swarm
of
children
clattering
in
wooden
shoes
over
the
stone
flags
the
catechising
was
over
then
albine
gently
glided
out
of
the
stable
where
she
had
been
waiting
for
an
hour
amidst
the
reeking
warmth
that
emanated
from
desiree
s
pets
as
she
quietly
slipped
through
the
passage
that
led
to
the
vestry
she
caught
sight
of
la
teuse
who
was
going
to
her
kitchen
and
who
fortunately
did
not
turn
her
head
certain
now
of
not
being
seen
and
stopped
albine
softly
pushed
the
door
which
was
before
her
keeping
hold
of
it
in
order
that
it
might
make
no
noise
as
it
closed
again
and
she
found
herself
in
the
church
viii
at
first
she
could
see
nobody
outside
the
rain
had
again
begun
to
fall
in
fine
close
drops
the
church
looked
very
grey
and
gloomy
she
passed
behind
the
high
altar
and
walked
on
towards
the
pulpit
in
the
middle
of
the
nave
there
were
only
a
number
of
empty
benches
left
there
in
disorder
by
the
urchins
of
the
catechism
class
amidst
all
this
void
came
a
low
from
the
swaying
pendulum
she
went
down
the
church
to
knock
at
the
which
she
saw
standing
at
the
other
end
but
just
as
she
passed
the
chapel
of
the
dead
she
caught
sight
of
abbe
mouret
prostrated
before
the
great
bleeding
christ
he
did
not
stir
he
must
have
thought
that
it
was
only
la
teuse
putting
the
seats
in
order
behind
him
but
albine
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
serge
she
said
i
have
come
for
the
priest
raised
his
head
with
a
start
his
face
was
very
pale
he
remained
on
his
knees
and
crossed
himself
while
his
lips
still
quivered
with
the
words
of
his
prayer
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
she
continued
every
morning
and
every
evening
i
looked
to
see
if
you
were
not
coming
i
have
counted
the
days
till
i
could
keep
the
reckoning
no
longer
ah
for
weeks
and
weeks
then
when
i
grew
sure
that
you
were
not
coming
i
set
out
myself
and
came
here
i
said
to
myself
i
will
fetch
him
away
with
give
me
your
hand
and
let
us
she
stretched
out
her
hands
as
though
to
help
him
to
rise
but
he
only
crossed
himself
afresh
he
still
continued
his
prayers
as
he
looked
at
her
he
had
succeeded
in
calming
the
first
quiver
of
his
flesh
from
the
divine
grace
which
had
been
streaming
around
him
since
the
early
morning
like
a
celestial
bath
he
derived
a
superhuman
strength
it
is
not
right
for
you
to
be
here
he
said
gravely
go
away
you
are
aggravating
your
i
suffer
no
longer
she
said
with
a
smile
i
am
well
again
i
am
cured
now
that
i
see
you
once
more
listen
i
made
myself
out
worse
than
i
really
was
to
induce
them
to
go
and
fetch
you
i
am
quite
willing
to
confess
it
now
and
that
promise
of
going
away
of
leaving
the
neighbourhood
you
didn
t
suppose
i
should
have
kept
it
did
you
no
indeed
unless
i
had
carried
you
away
with
me
on
my
shoulders
the
others
don
t
know
it
but
you
must
know
that
i
can
not
now
live
anywhere
but
at
your
she
grew
quite
cheerful
again
and
drew
close
to
the
priest
with
the
caressing
ways
of
a
child
of
nature
never
noticing
his
cold
and
rigid
demeanour
and
she
became
impatient
clapped
her
hands
and
exclaimed
come
serge
make
up
your
mind
and
come
we
are
only
losing
time
there
is
no
necessity
to
think
so
much
about
it
it
is
quite
simple
i
am
going
to
take
you
with
me
if
you
don
t
want
any
one
to
see
you
we
will
go
along
by
the
mascle
it
is
not
very
easy
walking
but
i
managed
it
all
by
myself
and
when
we
are
together
we
can
help
each
other
you
know
the
way
don
t
you
we
cross
the
churchyard
we
descend
to
the
torrent
and
then
we
shall
only
have
to
follow
its
course
right
up
to
the
garden
and
one
is
quite
at
home
down
there
nobody
can
see
us
there
is
nothing
but
brambles
and
big
round
stones
the
bed
of
the
stream
is
nearly
dry
as
i
came
along
i
thought
when
he
is
with
me
we
will
walk
along
gently
together
and
kiss
one
come
serge
be
quick
i
am
waiting
for
the
priest
no
longer
appeared
to
hear
her
he
had
betaken
himself
to
his
prayers
again
and
was
asking
heaven
to
grant
him
the
courage
of
the
saints
before
entering
upon
the
supreme
struggle
he
was
arming
himself
with
the
flaming
sword
of
faith
for
a
moment
he
had
feared
he
was
wavering
he
had
required
all
a
martyr
s
courage
and
endurance
to
remain
firmly
kneeling
there
on
the
flagstones
while
albine
was
calling
him
his
heart
had
leapt
out
towards
her
all
his
blood
had
surged
passionately
through
his
veins
filling
him
with
an
intense
yearning
to
clasp
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
hair
her
mere
breath
had
awakened
all
the
memory
of
their
love
the
vast
garden
their
saunters
beneath
the
trees
and
all
the
joy
of
their
companionship
but
divine
grace
was
poured
down
upon
him
more
abundantly
and
the
torturing
strife
during
which
all
his
blood
seemed
to
quit
his
veins
lasted
but
a
moment
nothing
human
then
remained
within
him
he
had
become
wholly
god
s
albine
however
again
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
she
was
growing
uneasy
and
angry
why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
she
asked
you
can
t
refuse
you
will
come
with
me
remember
that
i
shall
die
if
you
refuse
but
no
you
can
t
it
is
impossible
we
lived
together
once
it
was
vowed
that
we
should
never
separate
twenty
times
at
least
did
you
give
yourself
to
me
you
bade
me
take
you
wholly
your
limbs
your
breath
your
very
life
itself
i
did
not
dream
it
all
there
is
nothing
of
you
that
you
have
not
given
to
me
not
a
hair
in
your
head
which
is
not
mine
your
hands
are
mine
for
days
and
days
have
i
held
them
clasped
in
mine
your
face
your
lips
your
eyes
your
brow
all
all
are
mine
and
i
have
lavished
my
love
upon
them
do
you
hear
me
serge
she
stood
erect
before
him
full
of
proud
assertion
with
outstretched
arms
and
in
a
louder
voice
she
repeated
do
you
hear
me
serge
you
belong
to
then
abbe
mouret
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
he
leant
against
the
altar
and
replied
no
you
are
mistaken
i
belong
to
he
was
full
of
serenity
his
shorn
face
seemed
like
that
of
some
stone
saint
whom
no
impulse
of
the
flesh
can
disturb
his
cassock
fell
around
him
in
straight
folds
like
a
black
concealing
all
the
outlines
of
his
body
albine
dropped
back
at
the
sight
of
that
sombre
phantom
of
her
former
love
she
missed
his
freely
flowing
beard
his
freely
flowing
curls
and
in
the
midst
of
his
shorn
locks
she
saw
the
pallid
circle
of
his
tonsure
which
disquieted
her
as
if
it
had
been
some
mysterious
evil
some
malignant
sore
which
had
grown
there
and
would
eat
away
all
memory
of
the
happy
days
they
had
spent
together
she
could
recognise
neither
his
hands
once
so
warm
with
caresses
nor
his
lissom
neck
once
so
sonorous
with
laughter
nor
his
agile
feet
which
had
carried
her
into
the
recesses
of
the
woodlands
could
this
indeed
be
the
strong
youth
with
whom
she
had
lived
one
whole
season
the
youth
with
soft
down
gleaming
on
his
bare
breast
with
skin
browned
by
the
sun
s
rays
with
every
limb
full
of
vibrating
life
at
this
present
hour
he
seemed
fleshless
his
hair
had
fallen
away
from
him
and
all
his
virility
had
withered
within
that
womanish
gown
which
left
him
sexless
oh
you
frighten
me
she
murmured
did
you
think
then
that
i
was
dead
that
you
put
on
mourning
take
off
that
black
thing
put
on
a
blouse
you
can
tuck
up
the
sleeves
and
we
will
catch
crayfishes
again
your
arms
used
to
be
as
white
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
cassock
as
though
to
tear
it
off
him
but
he
repulsed
her
with
a
gesture
without
touching
her
he
looked
at
her
now
and
strengthened
himself
against
temptation
by
never
allowing
his
eyes
to
leave
her
she
seemed
to
him
to
have
grown
taller
she
was
no
longer
the
playful
damsel
adorned
with
bunches
of
and
casting
to
the
winds
gay
gipsy
laughter
nor
was
she
the
amorosa
in
white
skirts
gracefully
bending
her
slender
form
as
she
sauntered
lingeringly
beside
the
hedges
now
there
was
a
velvety
bloom
upon
her
lips
her
hips
were
gracefully
rounded
her
bosom
was
in
full
bloom
she
had
become
a
woman
with
a
long
oval
face
that
seemed
expressive
of
fruitfulness
life
slumbered
within
her
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
luscious
maturity
the
priest
bathed
in
the
voluptuous
atmosphere
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
all
that
feminine
ripeness
took
a
bitter
pleasure
in
defying
the
caresses
of
her
coral
lips
the
tempting
smile
of
her
eyes
the
witching
charm
of
her
bosom
and
all
the
intoxication
which
seemed
to
pour
from
her
at
every
movement
he
even
carried
his
temerity
so
far
as
to
search
with
his
gaze
for
the
spots
that
he
had
once
so
hotly
kissed
the
corners
of
her
eyes
and
lips
her
narrow
temples
soft
as
satin
and
the
ambery
nape
of
her
neck
which
was
like
velvet
and
never
even
in
her
embrace
had
he
tasted
such
felicity
as
he
now
felt
in
martyring
himself
by
boldly
looking
in
the
face
the
love
that
he
refused
at
last
fearing
lest
he
might
there
yield
to
some
new
allurement
of
the
flesh
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
said
very
gently
i
can
not
hear
you
here
let
us
go
out
if
you
indeed
persist
in
adding
to
the
pain
of
both
of
us
our
presence
in
this
place
is
a
scandal
we
are
in
god
s
god
cried
albine
excitedly
suddenly
becoming
a
child
of
nature
once
more
god
who
is
he
i
know
nothing
of
your
god
i
want
to
know
nothing
of
him
if
he
has
stolen
you
away
from
me
who
have
never
harmed
him
my
uncle
jeanbernat
was
right
then
when
he
said
that
your
god
was
only
an
invention
to
frighten
people
and
make
them
weep
you
are
lying
you
love
me
no
longer
and
that
god
of
yours
does
not
you
are
in
his
house
now
said
abbe
mouret
sternly
you
blaspheme
with
a
breath
he
might
turn
you
into
she
laughed
with
proud
disdain
and
raised
her
hands
as
if
to
defy
heaven
ah
then
said
she
you
prefer
your
god
to
me
you
think
he
is
stronger
than
i
am
and
you
imagine
that
he
will
love
you
better
than
i
did
oh
but
you
are
a
child
a
foolish
child
come
leave
all
this
folly
we
will
return
to
the
garden
together
and
love
each
other
and
be
happy
and
free
that
that
is
life
this
time
she
succeeded
in
throwing
an
arm
round
his
waist
and
she
tried
to
drag
him
away
but
he
quivering
all
over
freed
himself
from
her
embrace
and
again
took
his
stand
against
the
altar
go
away
he
faltered
if
you
still
love
me
go
away
o
lord
pardon
her
and
pardon
me
too
for
thus
defiling
this
thy
house
should
i
go
with
her
beyond
the
door
i
might
perhaps
follow
her
here
in
thy
presence
i
am
strong
suffer
that
i
may
remain
here
to
protect
thee
from
albine
remained
silent
for
a
moment
then
in
a
calm
voice
she
said
well
let
us
stay
here
then
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
you
can
not
surely
be
cruel
you
will
understand
me
you
will
not
let
me
go
away
alone
oh
do
not
begin
to
excuse
yourself
i
will
not
lay
my
hands
upon
you
again
since
it
distresses
you
i
am
quite
calm
now
as
you
can
see
we
will
talk
quietly
as
we
used
to
do
in
the
old
days
when
we
lost
our
way
and
did
not
hurry
to
find
it
again
that
we
might
have
the
more
time
to
talk
she
smiled
at
that
memory
and
continued
i
don
t
know
about
these
things
myself
my
uncle
jeanbernat
used
to
forbid
me
to
go
to
church
silly
girl
he
d
say
to
me
why
do
you
want
to
go
to
a
stuffy
building
when
you
have
got
a
garden
to
run
about
in
i
grew
up
quite
happy
and
contented
i
used
to
look
in
the
birds
nests
without
even
taking
the
eggs
i
did
not
even
pluck
the
flowers
for
fear
of
hurting
the
plants
and
you
know
that
i
could
never
torture
an
insect
why
then
should
god
be
angry
with
me
you
should
learn
to
know
him
pray
to
him
and
render
him
the
constant
worship
which
is
his
due
answered
the
priest
ah
it
would
please
you
if
i
did
would
it
not
she
said
you
would
forgive
me
and
love
me
again
well
i
will
do
all
that
you
wish
me
tell
me
about
god
and
i
will
believe
in
him
and
worship
him
all
that
you
tell
me
shall
be
a
truth
to
which
i
will
listen
on
my
knees
have
i
ever
had
a
thought
that
was
not
your
own
we
will
begin
our
long
walks
again
and
you
shall
teach
me
and
make
of
me
whatever
you
will
say
yes
i
beg
of
abbe
mouret
pointed
to
his
cassock
i
can
not
he
simply
said
i
am
a
a
priest
she
repeated
after
him
the
smile
dying
out
of
her
eyes
my
uncle
says
that
priests
have
neither
wife
nor
sister
nor
mother
so
that
is
true
then
but
why
did
you
ever
come
it
was
you
who
took
me
for
your
sister
for
your
wife
were
you
then
lying
the
priest
raised
his
pale
face
moist
with
the
sweat
of
agony
i
have
sinned
he
murmured
when
i
saw
you
so
free
the
girl
went
on
i
thought
that
you
were
no
longer
a
priest
i
believed
that
all
that
was
over
that
you
would
always
remain
there
with
me
and
for
my
and
now
what
would
you
have
me
do
if
you
rob
me
of
my
whole
life
what
i
do
he
answered
kneel
down
suffer
on
your
knees
and
never
rise
until
god
pardons
are
you
a
coward
then
she
exclaimed
her
anger
roused
once
more
her
lips
curving
scornfully
he
staggered
and
kept
silence
agony
held
him
by
the
throat
but
he
proved
stronger
than
pain
he
held
his
head
erect
and
a
smile
almost
played
about
his
trembling
lips
albine
for
a
moment
defied
him
with
her
fixed
glance
then
carried
away
by
a
fresh
burst
of
passion
she
exclaimed
well
answer
me
accuse
me
say
it
was
i
who
came
to
tempt
you
that
will
be
the
climax
speak
and
say
what
you
can
for
yourself
strike
me
if
you
like
i
should
prefer
your
blows
to
that
stiffness
you
put
on
is
there
no
blood
left
in
your
veins
have
you
no
spirit
don
t
you
hear
me
calling
you
a
coward
yes
indeed
you
are
a
coward
you
should
never
have
loved
me
since
you
may
not
be
a
man
is
it
that
black
robe
of
yours
which
holds
you
back
tear
it
off
when
you
are
naked
perhaps
you
will
remember
yourself
the
priest
slowly
repeated
his
former
words
i
have
sinned
i
had
no
excuse
for
my
sin
i
do
penitence
for
my
sin
without
hope
of
pardon
if
i
tore
off
my
cassock
i
should
tear
away
my
very
flesh
for
i
have
given
myself
wholly
to
god
soul
and
body
i
am
a
and
i
what
is
to
become
of
me
cried
albine
he
looked
unflinchingly
at
her
may
your
sufferings
be
reckoned
against
me
as
so
many
crimes
may
i
be
eternally
punished
for
the
desertion
in
which
i
am
forced
to
leave
you
that
will
be
only
just
all
unworthy
though
i
be
i
pray
for
you
each
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
an
air
of
great
discouragement
her
anger
was
subsiding
she
almost
felt
inclined
to
pity
him
you
are
mad
she
murmured
keep
your
prayers
it
is
you
yourself
that
i
want
but
you
will
never
understand
me
there
were
so
many
things
i
wanted
to
tell
you
yet
you
stand
there
and
irritate
me
with
your
chatter
of
another
world
come
let
us
try
to
talk
sensibly
let
us
wait
for
a
moment
till
we
are
calmer
you
can
not
dismiss
me
in
this
way
i
can
not
leave
you
here
it
is
because
you
are
here
that
you
are
so
so
cold
that
i
dare
not
touch
you
we
won
t
talk
any
more
just
now
we
will
wait
a
she
ceased
speaking
and
took
a
few
steps
examining
the
little
church
the
rain
was
still
gently
pattering
against
the
windows
and
the
cold
damp
light
seemed
to
moisten
the
walls
not
a
sound
came
from
outside
save
the
monotonous
plashing
of
the
rain
the
sparrows
were
doubtless
crouching
for
shelter
under
the
tiles
and
the
s
deserted
branches
showed
but
indistinctly
in
the
veiling
drenching
downpour
five
o
clock
struck
grated
out
stroke
by
stroke
from
the
wheezy
chest
of
the
old
clock
and
then
the
silence
fell
again
seeming
to
grow
yet
deeper
dimmer
and
more
despairing
the
priest
s
painting
work
as
yet
scarcely
dry
gave
to
the
high
altar
and
the
wainscoting
an
appearance
of
gloomy
cleanliness
like
that
of
some
convent
chapel
where
the
sun
never
shines
grievous
anguish
seemed
to
fill
the
nave
splashed
with
the
blood
that
flowed
from
the
limbs
of
the
huge
christ
while
along
the
walls
the
fourteen
scenes
of
the
passion
displayed
their
awful
story
in
red
and
yellow
daubs
reeking
with
horror
it
was
life
that
was
suffering
the
last
agonies
there
amidst
that
deathlike
quiver
of
the
atmosphere
upon
those
altars
which
resembled
tombs
in
that
bare
vault
which
looked
like
a
sepulchre
the
surroundings
all
spoke
of
slaughter
and
gloom
terror
and
anguish
and
nothingness
a
faint
scent
of
incense
still
lingered
there
like
the
last
expiring
breath
of
some
dead
girl
who
had
been
hurriedly
stifled
beneath
the
flagstones
ah
said
albine
at
last
how
sweet
it
used
to
be
in
the
sunshine
don
t
you
remember
one
morning
we
walked
past
a
hedge
of
tall
rose
bushes
to
the
left
of
the
i
recollect
the
very
colour
of
the
grass
it
was
almost
blue
shot
with
green
when
we
reached
the
end
of
the
hedge
we
turned
and
walked
back
again
so
sweet
was
the
perfume
of
the
sunny
air
and
we
did
nothing
else
that
morning
we
took
just
twenty
paces
forward
and
then
twenty
paces
back
it
was
so
sweet
a
spot
you
would
not
leave
it
the
bees
buzzed
all
around
and
there
was
a
tomtit
that
never
left
us
but
skipped
along
by
our
side
from
branch
to
branch
you
whispered
to
me
how
delightful
is
life
ah
life
it
was
the
green
grass
the
trees
the
running
waters
the
sky
and
the
sun
amongst
which
we
seemed
all
fair
and
she
mused
for
another
moment
and
then
continued
life
twas
the
paradou
how
vast
it
used
to
seem
to
us
never
were
we
able
to
find
the
end
of
it
the
sea
of
foliage
rolled
freely
with
rustling
waves
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
all
that
glorious
blue
overhead
we
were
free
to
grow
and
soar
and
roam
like
the
clouds
without
meeting
more
obstacles
than
they
the
very
air
was
ours
she
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
low
walls
of
the
church
but
here
you
are
in
a
grave
you
can
not
stretch
out
your
hand
without
hurting
it
against
the
stones
the
roof
hides
the
sky
from
you
and
blots
out
the
sun
it
is
all
so
small
and
confined
that
your
limbs
grow
stiff
and
cramped
as
though
you
were
buried
no
answered
the
priest
the
church
is
wide
as
the
but
she
waved
her
hands
towards
the
crosses
and
the
dying
christ
and
the
pictures
of
the
passion
and
you
live
in
the
very
midst
of
death
the
grass
the
trees
the
springs
the
sun
the
sky
all
are
in
the
death
throes
around
no
no
all
revives
all
grows
purified
and
reascends
to
the
source
of
he
had
now
drawn
himself
quite
erect
with
flashing
eyes
and
feeling
that
he
was
now
invincible
so
permeated
with
faith
as
to
disdain
temptation
he
quitted
the
altar
took
albine
s
hand
and
led
her
as
though
she
had
been
his
sister
to
the
ghastly
pictures
of
the
stations
of
the
cross
see
he
said
this
is
what
god
suffered
jesus
is
cruelly
scourged
look
his
shoulders
are
naked
his
flesh
is
torn
his
blood
flows
down
his
back
and
jesus
is
crowned
with
thorns
tears
of
blood
trickle
down
his
gashed
brow
on
his
temple
is
a
jagged
wound
again
jesus
is
insulted
by
the
soldiers
his
murderers
have
scoffingly
thrown
a
purple
robe
around
his
shoulders
and
they
spit
upon
his
face
and
strike
him
and
press
the
thorny
crown
deep
into
his
albine
turned
away
her
head
that
she
might
not
see
the
crudely
painted
pictures
in
which
the
ochreous
flesh
of
christ
had
been
plentifully
bedaubed
with
carmine
wounds
the
purple
robe
round
his
shoulders
seemed
like
a
shred
of
his
skin
torn
away
why
suffer
why
die
she
said
o
serge
if
you
would
only
remember
you
told
me
that
morning
that
you
were
tired
but
i
knew
that
you
were
only
pretending
for
the
air
was
quite
cool
and
we
had
only
been
walking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
you
wanted
to
sit
down
that
you
might
hold
me
in
your
arms
right
down
in
the
orchard
by
the
edge
of
a
stream
there
was
a
cherry
tree
you
remember
it
don
t
you
which
you
never
could
pass
without
wishing
to
kiss
my
hands
and
your
kisses
ran
all
up
my
arms
and
shoulders
to
my
lips
cherry
time
was
over
and
so
you
devoured
my
lips
it
used
to
make
us
feel
so
sad
to
see
the
flowers
fading
and
one
day
when
you
found
a
dead
bird
in
the
grass
you
turned
quite
pale
and
caught
me
to
your
breast
as
if
to
forbid
the
earth
to
take
but
the
priest
drew
her
towards
the
other
stations
of
the
cross
hush
hush
he
cried
look
here
and
here
bow
down
in
grief
and
pity
jesus
falls
beneath
the
weight
of
his
cross
the
ascent
of
calvary
is
very
tiring
he
has
dropped
down
on
his
knees
but
he
does
not
stay
to
wipe
even
the
sweat
from
his
brow
he
rises
up
again
and
continues
his
journey
and
again
jesus
falls
beneath
the
weight
of
his
cross
at
each
step
he
staggers
this
time
he
has
fallen
on
his
side
so
heavily
that
for
a
moment
he
lies
there
quite
breathless
his
lacerated
hands
have
relaxed
their
hold
upon
the
cross
his
bruised
and
aching
feet
leave
prints
behind
them
agonising
weariness
overwhelms
him
for
he
carries
upon
his
shoulders
the
sins
of
the
whole
albine
gazed
at
the
pictured
jesus
lying
in
a
blue
shirt
prostrate
beneath
the
cross
the
blackness
of
which
bedimmed
the
gold
of
his
aureole
then
with
her
glance
wandering
far
away
she
said
oh
those
have
you
no
memory
left
serge
have
you
forgotten
those
soft
grassy
walks
through
the
meadows
amidst
very
seas
of
greenery
on
the
afternoon
i
am
telling
you
of
we
had
only
meant
to
stay
out
of
doors
an
hour
but
we
went
wandering
on
and
were
still
wandering
when
the
stars
came
out
above
us
ah
how
velvety
it
was
that
endless
carpet
soft
as
finest
silk
it
was
just
like
a
green
sea
whose
gentle
waters
lapped
us
round
and
well
we
knew
whither
those
beguiling
paths
that
led
nowhere
were
taking
us
they
were
taking
us
to
our
love
to
the
joy
of
living
together
to
the
certainty
of
with
his
hands
trembling
with
anguish
abbe
mouret
pointed
to
the
remaining
pictures
jesus
he
stammered
jesus
is
nailed
to
the
cross
the
nails
are
hammered
through
his
outspread
hands
a
single
nail
suffices
for
his
feet
whose
bones
split
asunder
he
himself
while
his
flesh
quivers
with
pain
fixes
his
eyes
upon
heaven
and
smiles
jesus
is
crucified
between
two
thieves
the
weight
of
his
body
terribly
aggravates
his
wounds
from
his
brow
from
his
limbs
does
a
bloody
sweat
stream
down
the
two
thieves
insult
him
the
mock
at
him
the
soldiers
cast
lots
for
his
raiment
and
the
shadowy
darkness
grows
deeper
and
the
sun
hides
himself
jesus
dies
upon
the
cross
he
utters
a
piercing
cry
and
gives
up
the
ghost
oh
most
terrible
of
deaths
the
veil
of
the
temple
is
rent
in
twain
from
top
to
bottom
the
earth
quakes
the
stones
are
broken
and
the
very
graves
the
priest
had
fallen
on
his
knees
his
voice
choked
by
sobs
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
three
crosses
of
calvary
where
writhed
the
gaunt
pallid
bodies
of
the
crucified
albine
placed
herself
in
front
of
the
paintings
in
order
that
he
might
no
longer
see
them
one
evening
she
said
i
lay
through
the
long
gloaming
with
my
head
upon
your
lap
it
was
in
the
forest
at
the
end
of
that
great
avenue
of
through
which
the
setting
sun
shot
a
parting
ray
ah
what
a
caressing
farewell
he
bade
us
he
lingered
awhile
by
our
feet
with
a
kindly
smile
as
if
saying
till
the
sky
slowly
grew
paler
i
told
you
merrily
that
it
was
taking
off
its
blue
gown
and
donning
its
robe
of
black
to
go
out
for
the
evening
and
it
was
not
night
that
fell
but
a
soft
dimness
a
veil
of
love
and
mystery
reminding
us
of
those
dusky
paths
where
the
foliage
arches
overhead
one
of
those
paths
in
which
one
hides
for
a
moment
with
the
certainty
of
finding
the
joyousness
of
daylight
at
the
other
end
that
evening
the
calm
clearness
of
the
twilight
gave
promise
of
a
splendid
morrow
when
i
saw
that
it
did
not
grow
dark
as
quickly
as
you
wished
i
pretended
to
fall
asleep
i
may
confess
it
to
you
now
but
i
was
not
really
sleeping
while
you
kissed
me
on
the
eyes
i
felt
your
kisses
and
tried
to
keep
from
laughing
and
then
when
the
darkness
really
came
it
was
like
one
long
caress
the
trees
slept
no
more
than
i
did
at
night
don
t
you
remember
the
flowers
always
breathed
a
stronger
then
as
he
still
remained
on
his
knees
while
tears
streamed
down
his
face
she
caught
him
by
the
wrists
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet
resuming
passionately
oh
if
you
knew
you
would
bid
me
carry
you
off
you
would
fasten
your
arms
about
my
neck
lest
i
should
go
away
without
you
yesterday
i
had
a
longing
to
see
the
garden
once
more
it
seems
larger
deeper
more
unfathomable
than
ever
i
discovered
there
new
scents
so
sweetly
aromatic
that
they
brought
tears
into
my
eyes
in
the
avenues
i
found
a
rain
of
sunbeams
that
thrilled
me
with
desire
the
roses
spoke
to
me
of
you
the
bullfinches
were
amazed
at
seeing
me
alone
all
the
garden
broke
out
into
sighs
oh
come
never
has
the
grass
spread
itself
out
more
softly
i
have
marked
with
a
flower
the
hidden
nook
whither
i
long
to
take
you
it
is
a
nest
of
greenery
in
the
midst
of
a
tangle
of
brushwood
and
there
one
can
hear
all
the
teeming
life
of
the
garden
of
the
trees
and
the
streams
and
the
sky
the
earth
s
very
breathing
will
softly
lull
us
to
rest
there
oh
come
come
and
let
us
love
one
another
amidst
that
universal
loving
but
he
pushed
her
from
him
he
had
returned
to
the
chapel
of
the
dead
and
stood
in
front
of
the
painted
christ
big
as
a
boy
that
writhed
in
such
horridly
realistic
agony
there
were
real
iron
nails
driven
into
the
figure
s
limbs
and
the
wounds
gaped
in
the
torn
and
bleeding
flesh
o
jesus
who
hast
died
for
us
cried
the
priest
convince
her
of
our
nothingness
tell
her
that
we
are
but
dust
rottenness
and
damnation
ah
suffer
that
i
may
hide
my
head
in
a
and
rest
it
against
thy
feet
and
stay
there
motionless
until
i
rot
away
in
death
the
earth
will
no
longer
exist
for
me
the
sun
will
no
longer
shine
i
shall
see
nothing
more
feel
nothing
hear
nothing
nought
of
all
this
wretched
world
will
come
to
turn
my
soul
from
its
adoration
of
he
was
gradually
becoming
more
and
more
excited
and
he
stepped
towards
albine
with
upraised
hands
you
said
rightly
it
is
death
that
is
present
here
death
that
is
before
my
eyes
death
that
delivers
and
saves
one
from
all
rottenness
hear
me
i
renounce
i
deny
life
i
wholly
refuse
it
i
spit
upon
it
those
flowers
of
yours
stink
your
sun
dazzles
and
blinds
your
grass
makes
lepers
of
those
that
lie
upon
it
your
garden
is
but
a
where
all
rots
and
putrefies
the
earth
reeks
with
abomination
you
lie
when
you
talk
of
love
and
light
and
gladsome
life
in
the
depths
of
your
palace
of
greenery
there
is
nought
but
darkness
there
those
trees
of
yours
exhale
a
poison
which
transforms
men
into
beasts
your
thickets
are
charged
with
the
venom
of
vipers
your
streams
carry
pestilence
in
their
blue
waters
if
i
could
snatch
away
from
that
world
of
nature
which
you
extol
its
kirtle
of
sunshine
and
its
girdle
of
greenery
you
would
see
it
hideous
like
a
very
fury
a
skeleton
rotting
away
with
disease
and
vice
and
even
if
you
spoke
the
truth
even
if
your
hands
were
really
filled
with
pleasures
even
if
you
should
carry
me
to
a
couch
of
roses
and
offer
me
the
dreams
of
paradise
i
would
defend
myself
yet
the
more
desperately
from
your
embraces
there
is
war
between
us
war
eternal
and
implacable
see
the
church
is
very
small
it
is
it
is
ugly
its
and
pulpit
are
made
of
common
deal
its
font
is
merely
of
plaster
its
altars
are
formed
of
four
boards
which
i
have
painted
myself
but
what
of
that
it
is
yet
vaster
than
your
garden
greater
than
the
valley
greater
even
than
the
whole
earth
it
is
an
impregnable
fortress
which
nothing
can
ever
break
down
the
winds
the
sun
the
forests
the
ocean
all
that
is
may
combine
to
assault
it
yet
it
will
stand
erect
and
unshaken
for
ever
yes
let
all
the
jungles
tower
aloft
and
assail
the
walls
with
their
thorny
arms
let
all
the
legions
of
insects
swarm
out
of
their
holes
in
the
ground
and
gnaw
at
the
walls
the
church
ruinous
though
it
may
seem
will
never
fall
before
the
invasion
of
life
it
is
death
death
the
inexpugnable
and
do
you
know
what
will
one
day
happen
the
tiny
church
will
grow
and
spread
to
such
a
colossal
size
and
will
cast
around
such
a
mighty
shadow
that
all
that
nature
you
speak
of
will
give
up
the
ghost
ah
death
the
death
of
everything
with
the
skies
gaping
to
receive
our
souls
above
the
ruins
of
the
world
as
he
shouted
those
last
words
he
pushed
albine
forcibly
towards
the
door
she
extremely
pale
retreated
step
by
step
when
he
had
finished
in
a
gasping
voice
she
very
gravely
answered
it
is
all
over
then
you
drive
me
away
yet
i
am
your
wife
it
is
you
who
made
me
so
and
god
since
he
permitted
it
can
not
punish
us
to
such
a
point
as
she
was
now
on
the
threshold
and
she
added
listen
every
day
at
sunset
i
go
to
the
end
of
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
the
wall
has
fallen
in
i
shall
wait
for
you
and
then
she
disappeared
the
vestry
door
fell
back
with
a
sound
like
a
deep
sigh
ix
the
church
was
perfectly
silent
except
for
the
murmuring
sound
of
the
rain
which
was
falling
heavily
once
more
in
that
sudden
change
to
quietude
the
priest
s
anger
subsided
and
he
even
felt
moved
it
was
with
his
face
streaming
with
tears
his
frame
shaken
by
sobs
that
he
went
back
to
throw
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
great
crucifix
a
torrent
of
ardent
thanksgiving
burst
from
his
lips
thanks
be
to
thee
o
god
for
the
help
which
thou
hast
graciously
bestowed
upon
me
without
thy
grace
i
should
have
hearkened
unto
the
promptings
of
my
flesh
and
should
have
miserably
returned
to
my
sin
it
was
thy
grace
that
girded
my
loins
as
with
armour
for
battle
thy
grace
was
indeed
my
armour
my
courage
the
support
of
my
soul
that
kept
me
erect
beyond
weakness
oh
my
god
thou
wert
in
me
it
was
thy
voice
that
spoke
in
me
for
i
no
longer
felt
the
cowardice
of
the
flesh
i
could
have
cut
asunder
my
very
and
now
o
god
i
offer
thee
my
bleeding
heart
it
no
longer
belongs
to
any
creature
of
this
world
it
is
thine
alone
to
give
it
to
thee
i
have
wrenched
it
from
all
worldly
affection
but
think
not
o
god
that
i
take
any
pride
to
myself
for
this
victory
i
know
that
without
thee
i
am
nothing
and
i
humbly
cast
myself
at
thy
he
sank
down
upon
the
altar
steps
unable
to
utter
another
word
while
his
breath
panted
from
his
parted
lips
the
divine
grace
bathed
him
in
ineffable
ecstasy
he
sought
jesus
in
the
recesses
of
his
being
in
that
sanctuary
of
love
which
he
was
ever
preparing
for
his
worthy
reception
and
jesus
was
now
present
there
the
abbe
knew
it
by
the
sweet
influences
which
permeated
him
and
thereupon
he
joined
with
jesus
in
that
spiritual
converse
which
at
times
bore
him
away
from
earth
to
companionship
with
god
he
sighed
out
the
verse
from
the
song
of
solomon
my
beloved
is
mine
and
i
am
his
he
feedeth
his
flock
among
the
lilies
until
the
day
be
cool
and
the
shadows
flee
he
pondered
over
the
words
of
the
imitation
it
is
a
great
art
to
know
how
to
talk
with
jesus
and
it
requires
much
prudence
to
keep
him
near
and
then
with
adorable
condescension
jesus
came
down
to
him
and
spoke
with
him
for
hours
of
his
needs
his
happiness
and
his
hopes
their
confidences
were
not
less
affectionate
and
touching
than
those
of
two
friends
who
meet
after
long
separation
and
quietly
retire
to
converse
on
the
bank
of
some
lonely
stream
for
during
those
hours
of
divine
condescension
jesus
deigned
to
be
his
friend
his
best
most
faithful
friend
one
who
never
forsook
him
and
who
in
return
for
a
little
love
gave
him
all
the
treasures
of
eternal
life
that
day
the
priest
was
eager
to
prolong
the
sweet
converse
and
indeed
when
six
o
clock
sounded
through
the
quiet
church
he
was
still
listening
to
the
words
which
echoed
through
his
soul
on
his
side
there
was
unreserved
confession
unimpeded
by
the
restraints
of
language
natural
effusion
of
the
heart
which
spoke
even
more
quickly
than
the
mind
abbe
mouret
told
everything
to
jesus
as
to
a
god
who
had
come
down
in
all
the
intimacy
of
the
most
loving
tenderness
and
who
would
listen
to
everything
he
confessed
that
he
still
loved
albine
and
he
was
surprised
that
he
had
been
able
to
speak
sternly
to
her
and
drive
her
away
without
his
whole
being
breaking
out
into
revolt
he
marvelled
at
it
and
smiled
as
though
it
were
some
wonderful
miracle
performed
by
another
and
jesus
told
him
that
he
must
not
be
astonished
and
that
the
greatest
saints
were
often
but
unconscious
instruments
in
the
hands
of
god
then
the
abbe
gave
expression
to
a
doubt
had
he
not
lost
merit
in
seeking
refuge
in
the
cross
and
even
in
the
passion
of
his
saviour
had
he
not
shown
that
he
possessed
as
yet
but
little
courage
since
he
had
not
dared
to
fight
unaided
but
jesus
evinced
kindly
tolerance
and
answered
that
man
s
weakness
was
god
s
continual
care
and
that
he
especially
loved
those
suffering
souls
to
whose
assistance
he
went
like
a
friend
to
the
bedside
of
a
sick
companion
but
was
it
a
sin
to
love
albine
a
sin
for
which
he
serge
would
be
damned
no
if
his
love
was
clean
of
all
fleshly
taint
and
added
another
hope
to
his
desire
for
eternal
life
but
then
how
was
he
to
love
her
in
silence
without
speaking
a
word
to
her
without
taking
a
step
towards
her
simply
allowing
his
pure
affection
to
breathe
forth
like
a
sweet
perfume
pleasing
unto
heaven
and
jesus
smiled
with
increasing
kindliness
drawing
nearer
as
if
to
encourage
confession
in
such
wise
that
the
priest
grew
bolder
and
began
to
recapitulate
albine
s
charms
she
had
hair
that
was
fair
and
golden
as
an
angel
s
she
was
very
white
with
big
soft
eyes
like
those
of
the
aureoled
saints
jesus
seemed
to
listen
to
this
in
silence
though
a
smile
still
played
upon
his
face
and
the
priest
continued
she
had
grown
much
taller
she
was
now
like
a
queen
with
rounded
form
and
splendid
shoulders
oh
to
clasp
her
waist
were
it
only
for
a
second
and
to
feel
her
shoulders
drawn
close
by
his
embrace
but
the
smile
on
the
divine
countenance
then
paled
and
died
away
as
a
star
sinks
and
falls
beneath
the
horizon
abbe
mouret
now
spoke
all
alone
ah
had
he
not
shown
himself
too
why
had
he
driven
her
away
without
one
single
word
of
affection
since
heaven
allowed
him
to
love
her
i
do
love
her
i
do
love
her
he
cried
aloud
in
a
distracted
voice
that
rang
through
the
church
he
thought
he
saw
her
still
standing
there
she
was
stretching
out
her
arms
to
him
she
was
beautiful
enough
to
make
him
break
all
his
vows
he
threw
himself
upon
her
bosom
without
thought
of
the
reverence
due
to
his
surroundings
he
clasped
her
and
rained
kisses
upon
her
face
it
was
before
her
that
he
now
knelt
imploring
her
mercy
and
beseeching
her
to
forgive
him
his
unkindness
he
told
her
that
at
times
a
voice
which
was
not
his
own
spoke
through
his
lips
could
he
himself
ever
have
treated
her
harshly
it
was
the
strange
voice
that
had
repulsed
her
it
could
not
surely
be
he
himself
for
he
would
have
been
unable
to
touch
a
hair
of
her
head
without
loving
emotion
and
yet
he
had
driven
her
away
the
church
was
really
empty
whither
should
he
hasten
to
find
her
again
to
bring
her
back
and
wipe
her
tears
away
with
kisses
the
rain
was
streaming
down
more
violently
than
ever
the
roads
must
be
rivers
of
mud
he
pictured
her
to
himself
lashed
by
the
downpour
tottering
alongside
the
ditches
her
clothes
soaked
and
clinging
to
her
skin
no
no
it
could
not
have
been
himself
it
was
that
other
voice
the
jealous
voice
that
had
so
cruelly
sought
to
slay
his
love
o
jesus
he
cried
in
desperation
be
merciful
and
give
her
back
to
me
but
his
lord
was
no
longer
there
then
abbe
mouret
awaking
with
a
start
turned
horribly
pale
he
understood
it
all
he
had
not
known
how
to
keep
jesus
with
him
he
had
lost
his
friend
and
had
been
left
defenceless
against
the
powers
of
evil
instead
of
that
inward
light
which
had
shone
so
brightly
within
him
as
he
received
his
god
he
now
found
utter
darkness
a
foul
vapour
that
irritated
his
senses
jesus
had
withdrawn
his
grace
on
leaving
him
and
he
who
since
early
morning
had
been
so
strong
with
help
now
felt
utterly
miserable
forsaken
weak
and
helpless
as
an
infant
how
frightful
was
his
fall
how
galling
its
bitterness
to
have
straggled
so
heroically
to
have
remained
unshaken
invincible
implacable
while
the
temptress
actually
stood
before
him
with
all
her
warm
life
her
swelling
bosom
and
superb
shoulders
her
perfume
of
love
and
passion
and
then
to
fall
so
shamefully
to
throb
with
desire
when
she
had
disappeared
leaving
behind
her
but
the
echo
of
her
skirts
and
the
fragrance
diffused
from
her
white
neck
now
these
mere
recollections
sufficed
to
make
her
all
powerful
her
influence
permeated
the
church
jesus
jesus
cried
the
priest
once
more
return
come
back
to
me
speak
to
me
once
again
but
jesus
remained
deaf
to
his
cry
for
a
moment
abbe
mouret
raised
his
arms
to
heaven
in
desperate
entreaty
his
shoulders
cracked
and
strained
beneath
the
wild
violence
of
his
supplications
but
soon
his
hands
fell
down
again
in
discouragement
heaven
preserved
that
hopeless
silence
which
suppliants
at
times
encounter
then
he
once
more
sat
down
on
the
altar
steps
and
with
ashen
face
pressing
his
elbows
to
his
sides
as
though
he
were
trying
to
reduce
his
flesh
to
the
smallest
proportions
possible
my
god
thou
deserted
me
he
murmured
nevertheless
thy
will
be
done
he
spoke
not
another
word
but
sat
there
panting
breathlessly
like
a
hunted
beast
that
cowers
motionless
in
fear
of
the
hounds
ever
since
his
sin
he
had
thus
seemed
to
be
the
sport
of
the
divine
grace
it
denied
itself
to
his
most
ardent
prayers
it
poured
down
upon
him
unexpectedly
and
refreshingly
when
he
had
lost
all
hope
of
winning
it
for
long
years
to
come
at
first
he
had
been
inclined
to
rebel
against
this
dispensation
of
heaven
complaining
like
a
betrayed
lover
and
demanding
the
immediate
return
of
that
consoling
grace
whose
kiss
made
him
so
strong
but
afterwards
after
unavailing
outbursts
of
anger
he
had
learned
to
understand
that
humility
profited
him
most
and
could
alone
enable
him
to
endure
the
withdrawal
of
the
divine
assistance
then
for
hours
and
for
days
he
would
humble
himself
and
wait
for
comfort
which
came
not
in
vain
he
cast
himself
unreservedly
into
the
hands
of
god
annihilated
himself
before
the
divinity
wearied
himself
with
the
incessant
repetition
of
prayers
he
could
not
perceive
god
s
presence
with
him
and
his
flesh
breaking
free
from
all
restraint
rose
up
in
rebellious
desire
it
was
a
slow
agony
of
temptation
in
which
the
weapons
of
faith
fell
one
by
one
from
his
faltering
hands
in
which
he
lay
inert
in
the
clutch
of
passion
in
which
he
beheld
with
horror
his
own
ignominy
without
having
the
courage
to
raise
his
little
finger
to
free
himself
from
the
thraldom
of
sin
such
was
now
his
life
he
had
felt
sin
s
attacks
in
every
form
not
a
day
passed
that
he
was
not
tried
sin
assumed
a
thousand
guises
assailed
him
through
his
eyes
and
ears
flew
boldly
at
his
throat
leaped
treacherously
upon
his
shoulders
or
stole
torturingly
into
his
bones
his
transgression
was
ever
present
he
almost
always
beheld
albine
dazzling
as
the
sunshine
lighting
up
the
greenery
of
the
paradou
he
only
ceased
to
see
her
in
those
rare
moments
when
the
divine
grace
deigned
to
close
his
eyes
with
its
cool
caresses
and
he
strove
to
hide
his
sufferings
as
one
hides
those
of
some
disgraceful
disease
he
wrapped
himself
in
the
endless
silence
which
no
one
knew
how
to
make
him
break
filling
the
parsonage
with
his
martyrdom
and
resignation
and
exasperating
la
teuse
who
at
times
when
his
back
was
turned
would
shake
her
fist
at
heaven
this
time
he
was
alone
now
and
need
take
no
care
to
hide
his
torment
sin
had
just
struck
him
such
an
overwhelming
blow
that
he
had
not
strength
left
to
move
from
the
altar
steps
where
he
had
fallen
he
remained
there
sighing
and
groaning
parched
with
agony
incapable
of
a
single
tear
and
he
thought
of
the
calm
unruffled
life
that
had
once
been
his
ah
the
perfect
peace
the
full
confidence
of
his
first
days
at
les
artaud
the
path
of
salvation
had
seemed
so
straight
and
easy
then
he
had
smiled
at
the
very
mention
of
temptation
he
had
lived
in
the
midst
of
wickedness
without
knowledge
of
it
without
fear
of
it
certain
of
being
able
to
withstand
it
he
had
been
a
model
priest
so
pure
and
chaste
so
inexperienced
and
innocent
in
god
s
sight
that
god
had
led
him
by
the
hand
like
a
little
child
but
now
all
that
childlike
innocence
was
dead
god
visited
him
in
the
morning
and
forthwith
tried
him
a
state
of
temptation
became
his
life
on
earth
now
that
full
manhood
and
sin
had
come
upon
him
he
entered
into
the
everlasting
struggle
could
it
be
that
god
really
loved
him
more
now
than
before
the
great
saints
have
all
left
fragments
of
their
torn
flesh
upon
the
thorns
of
the
way
of
sorrow
he
tried
to
gather
some
consolation
from
this
circumstance
at
each
laceration
of
his
flesh
each
racking
of
his
bones
he
tried
to
assure
himself
of
some
exceeding
great
reward
and
then
no
infliction
that
heaven
might
now
cast
upon
him
could
be
too
heavy
he
even
looked
back
with
scorn
on
his
former
serenity
his
easy
fervour
which
had
set
him
on
his
knees
with
mere
girlish
enthusiasm
and
left
him
unconscious
even
of
the
bruising
of
the
hard
stones
he
strove
also
to
discover
pleasure
in
pain
in
plunging
into
it
annihilating
himself
in
it
but
even
while
he
poured
out
thanks
to
god
his
teeth
chattered
with
growing
terror
and
the
voice
of
his
rebellious
blood
cried
out
to
him
that
this
was
all
falsehood
and
that
the
only
happiness
worth
desiring
was
in
albine
s
arms
amongst
the
flowers
of
the
paradou
yet
he
had
put
aside
mary
for
jesus
sacrificing
his
heart
that
he
might
subdue
his
flesh
and
hoping
to
implant
some
virility
in
his
faith
mary
disquieted
him
too
much
with
her
smoothly
braided
hair
her
outstretched
hands
and
her
womanly
smile
he
could
never
kneel
before
her
without
dropping
his
eyes
for
fear
of
catching
sight
of
the
hem
of
her
dress
then
too
he
accused
her
of
having
treated
him
too
tenderly
in
former
times
she
had
kept
him
sheltered
so
long
within
the
folds
of
her
robe
that
he
had
let
himself
slip
from
her
arms
to
those
of
a
human
creature
without
being
conscious
even
of
the
change
of
his
affection
he
thought
of
all
the
roughness
of
brother
archangias
of
his
refusal
to
worship
mary
of
the
distrustful
glances
with
which
he
had
seemed
to
watch
her
he
himself
despaired
of
ever
rising
to
such
a
height
of
roughness
and
so
he
simply
left
her
hiding
her
images
and
deserting
her
altar
yet
she
remained
in
his
heart
like
some
love
which
though
unavowed
is
ever
present
sin
with
sacrilege
whose
very
horror
made
him
shudder
made
use
of
her
to
tempt
him
whenever
he
still
invoked
her
as
he
did
at
times
of
irrepressible
emotion
it
was
albine
who
showed
herself
beneath
the
white
veil
with
the
blue
scarf
knotted
round
her
waist
and
the
golden
roses
blooming
on
her
bare
feet
all
the
representations
of
the
virgin
the
virgin
with
the
royal
mantle
of
the
virgin
crowned
with
stars
the
virgin
visited
by
the
angel
of
the
annunciation
the
peaceful
virgin
poised
between
a
lily
and
a
distaff
all
brought
him
some
memory
of
albine
her
smiling
eyes
or
her
delicately
curved
mouth
or
her
softly
rounded
cheeks
thereupon
by
a
supreme
effort
he
drove
the
female
element
from
his
worship
and
sought
refuge
in
jesus
though
even
his
gentle
mildness
sometimes
proved
a
source
of
disquietude
to
him
what
he
needed
was
a
jealous
god
an
implacable
god
the
jehovah
of
the
old
testament
girded
with
thunder
and
manifesting
himself
only
to
chastise
the
terrified
world
he
had
done
with
the
saints
and
the
angels
and
the
divine
mother
he
bowed
down
before
god
himself
alone
the
omnipotent
master
who
demanded
from
him
his
every
breath
and
he
felt
the
hand
of
this
god
laid
heavily
upon
him
holding
him
helpless
at
his
mercy
through
space
and
time
like
a
guilty
atom
ah
to
be
nothing
to
be
damned
to
dream
of
hell
to
wrestle
vainly
against
hideous
temptations
all
that
was
surely
good
from
jesus
he
took
but
the
cross
he
was
seized
with
that
passion
for
the
cross
which
has
made
so
many
lips
press
themselves
again
and
again
to
the
crucifix
till
they
were
worn
away
with
kissing
he
took
up
the
cross
and
followed
jesus
he
sought
to
make
it
heavier
the
mightiest
of
burdens
it
was
great
joy
to
him
to
fall
beneath
its
weight
to
drag
it
on
his
knees
his
back
half
broken
in
it
he
beheld
the
only
source
of
strength
for
the
soul
of
joy
for
the
mind
of
the
consummation
of
virtue
and
the
perfection
of
holiness
in
it
lay
all
that
was
good
all
ended
in
death
upon
it
to
suffer
and
to
die
those
words
ever
sounded
in
his
ears
as
the
end
and
goal
of
mortal
wisdom
and
when
he
had
fastened
himself
to
the
cross
he
enjoyed
the
boundless
consolation
of
god
s
love
it
was
no
longer
now
upon
mary
that
he
lavished
filial
tenderness
or
lover
s
passion
he
loved
for
love
s
mere
sake
with
an
absolute
abstract
love
he
loved
god
with
a
love
that
lifted
him
out
of
himself
out
of
all
else
and
wrapped
him
round
with
a
dazzling
radiance
of
glory
he
was
like
a
torch
that
burns
away
with
blazing
light
and
death
seemed
to
him
to
be
only
a
great
impulse
of
love
but
what
had
he
omitted
to
do
that
he
was
thus
so
sorely
tried
with
his
hand
he
wiped
away
the
perspiration
that
streamed
down
his
brow
and
reflected
that
that
very
morning
he
had
made
his
usual
without
finding
any
great
guilt
within
him
was
he
not
leading
a
life
of
great
austerity
and
mortification
of
the
flesh
did
he
not
love
god
solely
and
blindly
ah
how
he
would
have
blessed
his
holy
name
had
he
only
restored
him
his
peace
deeming
him
now
sufficiently
punished
for
his
transgression
but
perhaps
that
sin
of
his
could
never
be
expiated
and
then
in
spite
of
himself
his
mind
reverted
to
albine
and
the
paradou
and
all
their
memories
at
first
he
tried
to
make
excuses
for
himself
he
had
fallen
one
evening
senseless
upon
the
tiled
floor
of
his
bedroom
stricken
with
brain
fever
for
three
weeks
he
had
remained
unconscious
his
blood
surged
furiously
through
his
veins
and
raged
within
him
like
a
torrent
that
had
burst
its
banks
his
whole
body
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
soles
of
his
feet
was
so
scoured
and
renewed
and
wrought
afresh
by
the
mighty
labouring
of
his
ailment
that
in
his
delirium
he
had
sometimes
thought
he
could
hear
the
very
hammer
blows
of
workmen
that
nailed
his
bones
together
again
then
one
morning
he
had
awakened
feeling
like
a
new
being
he
was
born
a
second
time
freed
of
all
that
his
years
of
life
had
successively
implanted
in
him
his
childish
piety
his
education
at
the
seminary
the
faith
of
his
early
priesthood
had
all
vanished
had
been
carried
off
and
their
place
was
bare
and
empty
in
truth
it
could
be
hell
alone
that
had
thus
prepared
him
for
the
reception
of
evil
disarming
him
of
all
his
former
weapons
and
reducing
his
body
to
languor
and
softness
through
which
sin
might
readily
enter
he
perfectly
unconscious
of
it
all
unknowingly
surrendered
himself
to
the
gradual
approach
of
evil
when
he
had
reopened
his
eyes
in
the
paradou
he
had
felt
himself
an
infant
once
more
with
no
memory
of
the
past
no
knowledge
of
his
priesthood
he
experienced
a
gentle
pleasure
a
glad
feeling
of
surprise
at
thus
beginning
life
afresh
as
though
it
were
all
new
and
strange
to
him
and
would
be
delightful
to
learn
oh
the
sweet
apprenticeship
the
charming
observations
the
delicious
discoveries
that
paradou
was
a
vast
abode
of
felicity
and
hell
in
placing
him
there
had
known
full
well
that
he
would
be
defenceless
never
in
his
first
youth
had
he
known
such
enjoyment
in
growing
that
first
youth
of
his
when
he
now
thought
of
it
seemed
quite
black
and
gloomy
graceless
wan
and
inactive
as
if
it
had
been
spent
far
away
from
the
sunlight
but
at
the
paradou
how
joyfully
had
he
hailed
the
sun
how
admiringly
had
he
gazed
at
the
first
tree
at
the
first
flower
at
the
tiniest
insect
he
had
seen
at
the
most
insignificant
pebble
he
had
picked
up
the
very
stones
charmed
him
the
horizon
was
a
source
of
amazement
one
clear
morning
the
memory
of
which
still
filled
his
eyes
bringing
back
a
perfume
of
jasmine
a
lark
s
clear
song
he
had
been
so
affected
by
emotion
that
he
felt
all
power
desert
his
limbs
he
had
long
found
pleasure
in
learning
the
sensations
of
life
and
ah
the
morning
when
albine
had
been
born
beside
him
amidst
the
roses
as
he
thought
of
it
an
ecstatic
smile
broke
out
upon
his
face
she
rose
up
like
a
star
that
was
necessary
to
the
very
sun
s
existence
she
illumined
everything
she
made
everything
clear
she
made
his
life
complete
then
in
fancy
he
once
again
walked
with
her
through
the
paradou
he
remembered
the
little
curls
that
waved
behind
her
neck
as
she
ran
on
before
him
she
exhaled
delicious
scent
and
the
touch
of
her
warm
swaying
skirts
seemed
like
a
caress
and
when
she
clasped
him
with
her
supple
curving
arms
he
half
expected
to
see
her
so
slight
and
slender
she
was
twine
herself
around
him
it
was
she
who
went
foremost
she
led
him
through
winding
paths
where
they
loitered
that
their
walk
might
last
the
longer
it
was
she
who
instilled
into
him
love
for
nature
and
it
was
by
watching
the
loves
of
the
plants
that
he
had
learned
to
love
her
with
a
love
that
was
long
indeed
in
bursting
into
life
but
whose
sweetness
had
been
theirs
at
last
beneath
the
shade
of
the
giant
tree
they
had
reached
their
journey
s
goal
oh
to
clasp
her
once
again
yet
once
again
a
low
groan
suddenly
came
from
the
priest
he
hastily
sprang
up
and
then
flung
himself
down
again
temptation
had
just
assailed
him
afresh
into
what
paths
were
his
recollections
leading
him
did
he
not
know
only
too
well
that
satan
avails
himself
of
every
wile
to
insinuate
his
into
the
soul
even
when
it
is
absorbed
in
no
no
he
had
no
excuse
his
illness
had
in
no
wise
authorised
him
to
sin
he
should
have
set
strict
guard
upon
himself
and
have
sought
god
anew
upon
recovering
from
his
fever
and
what
a
frightful
proof
he
now
had
of
his
vileness
he
was
not
even
able
to
make
calm
confession
of
his
sin
would
he
never
be
able
to
silence
his
nature
he
wildly
thought
of
scooping
his
brains
out
of
his
skull
that
he
might
be
able
to
think
no
more
and
of
opening
his
veins
that
his
blood
might
no
longer
torment
him
for
a
moment
he
buried
his
face
within
his
hands
shuddering
as
though
the
beasts
that
he
felt
prowling
around
him
might
infect
him
with
the
hot
breath
of
temptation
but
his
thoughts
strayed
on
in
spite
of
himself
and
his
blood
throbbed
wildly
in
his
very
heart
though
he
held
his
clenched
fists
to
his
eyes
he
still
saw
albine
dazzling
like
a
sun
every
effort
that
he
made
to
press
the
vision
from
his
sight
only
made
her
shine
out
before
him
with
increased
brilliancy
was
god
then
utterly
forsaking
him
that
he
could
find
no
refuge
from
temptation
and
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
control
his
thoughts
he
espied
every
tiny
blade
of
grass
that
thrust
itself
up
by
albine
s
skirts
he
saw
a
little
fastened
in
her
hair
against
which
he
remembered
that
he
had
pricked
his
lips
even
the
perfumed
atmosphere
of
the
paradou
floated
round
him
and
sounds
came
back
the
repeated
call
of
a
bird
then
an
interval
of
hushed
silence
then
a
sigh
floating
through
the
trees
why
did
not
heaven
at
once
strike
him
dead
with
its
lightning
that
would
have
been
less
cruel
it
was
with
a
voluptuous
pang
like
the
pangs
which
assail
the
damned
that
he
recalled
his
transgression
he
shuddered
when
he
again
heard
in
his
heart
the
abominable
words
that
he
had
spoken
at
albine
s
feet
their
echoes
were
now
accusing
him
before
the
throne
of
god
he
had
acknowledged
woman
as
his
sovereign
he
had
yielded
to
her
as
a
slave
kissing
her
feet
longing
to
be
the
water
she
drank
and
the
bread
she
ate
he
began
to
understand
now
why
he
could
no
longer
recover
god
had
given
him
over
to
woman
but
he
would
chastise
her
scourge
her
break
her
very
limbs
to
force
her
to
let
him
go
it
was
she
who
was
the
slave
she
the
creature
of
impurity
to
whom
the
church
should
have
denied
a
soul
then
he
braced
himself
and
shook
his
fists
at
the
vision
of
albine
but
his
fists
opened
and
his
hands
glided
along
her
shoulders
in
a
loving
caress
while
his
lips
just
now
breathing
out
anger
and
insult
pressed
themselves
to
her
hair
stammering
forth
words
of
adoration
abbe
mouret
opened
his
eyes
again
the
burning
apparition
of
albine
vanished
it
was
sudden
and
unexpected
solace
he
was
able
to
weep
tears
flowed
slowly
and
refreshingly
down
his
cheeks
and
he
drew
a
long
breath
still
fearing
to
move
lest
the
evil
one
should
again
grip
him
by
the
neck
for
he
yet
thought
that
he
heard
the
snarl
of
a
beast
behind
him
and
then
he
found
such
pleasure
in
the
cessation
of
his
sufferings
that
his
one
thought
was
to
prolong
the
enjoyment
of
it
outside
the
rain
had
ceased
falling
the
sun
was
setting
in
a
vast
crimson
glow
which
spread
across
the
windows
like
curtains
of
satin
the
church
was
quite
warm
and
bright
in
the
parting
breath
of
the
sinking
luminary
the
priest
thanked
god
for
the
respite
he
had
been
pleased
to
vouchsafe
to
him
a
broad
ray
of
light
like
a
beam
of
streamed
through
the
nave
and
illumined
the
far
end
of
the
building
the
clock
the
pulpit
and
the
high
altar
perhaps
the
divine
grace
was
returning
to
him
from
heaven
along
that
radiant
path
he
watched
with
interest
the
atoms
that
came
and
went
with
prodigious
speed
through
the
ray
like
a
swarm
of
busy
messengers
ever
hastening
with
news
from
the
sun
to
the
earth
a
thousand
lighted
candles
would
not
have
filled
the
church
with
such
splendour
curtains
of
seemed
to
hang
behind
the
high
altar
treasures
of
the
goldsmith
s
art
covered
all
the
ledges
arose
in
dazzling
sheaves
censers
glowed
full
of
burning
gems
sacred
vases
gleamed
like
fiery
comets
and
around
all
there
seemed
to
be
a
rain
of
luminous
flowers
amidst
waving
lacework
beds
bouquets
and
garlands
of
roses
from
whose
expanding
petals
dropped
showers
of
stars
never
had
abbe
mouret
desired
such
magnificence
for
his
poor
church
he
smiled
and
dreamt
of
how
he
might
retain
all
that
splendour
there
and
then
arrange
it
most
effectively
he
would
have
preferred
to
see
the
curtains
of
hung
rather
higher
the
vases
too
needed
more
careful
arrangement
and
he
thought
that
the
bouquets
of
flowers
might
be
tied
up
more
neatly
and
the
garlands
be
more
regularly
shaped
yet
how
wondrously
magnificent
it
all
was
he
was
the
pontiff
of
a
church
of
gold
bishops
princes
princesses
arrayed
in
royal
mantles
multitudes
of
believers
bending
to
the
ground
were
coming
to
visit
it
encamping
in
the
valley
waiting
for
weeks
at
the
door
until
they
should
be
able
to
enter
they
kissed
his
feet
for
even
his
feet
had
turned
to
gold
and
worked
miracles
the
bath
of
gold
mounted
to
his
knees
a
golden
heart
was
beating
within
his
golden
breast
with
so
clear
a
musical
pulsation
that
the
waiting
crowds
could
hear
it
from
outside
then
a
feeling
of
overweening
pride
seized
upon
him
he
was
an
idol
the
golden
beam
mounted
still
higher
the
high
altar
was
all
ablaze
with
glory
and
the
priest
grew
certain
that
the
divine
grace
must
be
returning
to
him
such
was
his
inward
satisfaction
the
fierce
snarl
behind
him
had
now
grown
gentle
and
coaxing
and
he
only
felt
on
his
shoulder
a
soft
velvety
pressure
as
though
some
giant
cat
were
lightly
caressing
him
he
still
pursued
his
reverie
never
before
had
he
seen
things
under
such
a
favourable
light
everything
seemed
quite
easy
to
him
now
that
he
once
more
felt
full
of
strength
since
albine
was
waiting
for
him
he
would
go
and
join
her
it
was
only
natural
on
the
previous
morning
he
had
married
fortune
and
rosalie
the
church
did
not
forbid
marriages
he
saw
that
young
couple
again
as
they
knelt
before
him
smiling
and
nudging
each
other
while
his
hands
were
held
over
them
in
benediction
then
in
the
evening
they
had
shown
him
their
room
each
word
that
he
had
spoken
to
them
echoed
loudly
in
his
ear
he
had
told
fortune
that
god
had
sent
him
a
companion
because
he
did
not
wish
man
to
live
alone
and
he
had
told
rosalie
that
she
must
cleave
to
her
husband
never
leaving
him
but
always
acting
as
his
obedient
helpmate
but
he
had
said
these
things
also
for
albine
and
himself
was
she
not
his
companion
his
obedient
helpmate
whom
god
had
sent
to
him
that
his
manhood
might
not
wither
up
in
solitude
besides
they
had
been
joined
the
one
to
the
other
he
felt
surprised
that
he
had
not
understood
and
recognised
it
at
once
that
he
had
not
gone
away
with
her
as
his
duty
plainly
required
that
he
should
have
done
but
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
now
he
would
certainly
join
her
in
the
morning
he
could
be
with
her
in
half
an
hour
he
would
go
through
the
village
and
take
the
road
up
the
hill
it
was
much
the
shortest
way
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
he
was
the
master
and
no
one
would
presume
to
say
anything
to
him
if
any
one
looked
at
him
a
wave
of
his
hand
would
force
them
to
bend
their
heads
he
would
live
with
albine
he
would
call
her
his
wife
they
would
be
very
happy
together
the
golden
stream
mounted
still
higher
and
played
amongst
his
fingers
again
did
he
seem
to
be
immersed
in
a
bath
of
gold
he
would
take
the
away
to
ornament
his
house
he
would
keep
up
a
fine
establishment
he
would
pay
his
servants
with
fragments
of
chalices
which
he
could
easily
break
with
his
fingers
he
would
hang
his
with
the
that
draped
the
altar
and
he
would
give
his
wife
for
jewels
the
golden
hearts
and
chaplets
and
crosses
that
hung
from
the
necks
of
the
virgin
and
the
saints
the
church
itself
if
another
storey
were
added
to
it
would
supply
them
with
a
palace
god
would
have
no
objection
to
make
since
he
had
allowed
them
to
love
each
other
and
besides
was
it
not
he
who
was
now
god
with
the
people
kissing
his
golden
feet
abbe
mouret
rose
he
made
that
sweeping
gesture
of
jeanbernat
s
that
wide
gesture
of
negation
that
took
in
everything
as
far
as
the
horizon
there
is
nothing
nothing
nothing
he
said
god
does
not
a
mighty
shudder
seemed
to
sweep
through
the
church
the
terrified
priest
turned
deadly
pale
and
listened
who
had
spoken
who
was
it
that
had
blasphemed
suddenly
the
velvety
caress
whose
gentle
pressure
he
had
felt
upon
his
shoulder
turned
fierce
and
savage
sharp
talons
seemed
to
be
rending
his
flesh
and
once
more
he
felt
his
blood
streaming
forth
yet
he
remained
on
his
feet
struggling
against
the
sudden
attack
he
cursed
and
reviled
the
triumphant
sin
that
sniggered
and
grinned
round
his
temples
whilst
all
the
hammers
of
the
evil
one
battered
at
them
why
had
he
not
been
on
his
guard
against
satan
s
wiles
did
he
not
know
full
well
that
it
was
his
habit
to
glide
up
softly
with
gentle
paws
that
he
might
drive
them
like
blades
into
the
very
vitals
of
his
victim
his
anger
increased
as
he
thought
how
he
had
been
entrapped
like
a
mere
child
was
he
destined
then
to
be
ever
hurled
to
the
ground
with
sin
crouching
victoriously
on
his
breast
this
time
he
had
actually
denied
his
god
it
was
all
one
fatal
descent
his
transgression
had
destroyed
his
faith
and
then
dogma
had
tottered
one
single
doubt
of
the
flesh
pleading
abomination
sufficed
to
sweep
heaven
away
the
divine
ordinances
irritated
one
the
divine
mysteries
made
one
smile
then
came
other
temptations
and
allurements
gold
power
unrestrained
liberty
an
irresistible
longing
for
enjoyment
culminating
in
luxuriousness
sprawling
on
a
bed
of
wealth
and
pride
and
then
god
was
robbed
his
vessels
were
broken
to
adorn
woman
s
impurity
ah
well
then
he
was
damned
nothing
could
make
any
difference
to
him
now
sin
might
speak
aloud
it
was
useless
to
struggle
further
the
monsters
who
had
hovered
about
his
neck
were
battening
on
his
vitals
now
he
yielded
to
them
with
hideous
satisfaction
he
shook
his
fists
at
the
church
no
he
believed
no
longer
in
the
divinity
of
christ
he
believed
no
longer
in
the
holy
trinity
he
believed
in
naught
but
himself
and
his
muscles
and
the
appetites
of
his
body
he
wanted
to
live
he
felt
the
necessity
of
being
a
man
oh
to
speed
along
through
the
open
air
to
be
lusty
and
strong
to
owe
obedience
to
no
jealous
master
to
fell
one
s
enemies
with
stones
to
carry
off
the
fair
maidens
that
passed
upon
one
s
shoulders
he
would
break
out
from
that
living
tomb
where
cruel
hands
had
thrust
him
he
would
awaken
his
manhood
which
had
only
been
slumbering
and
might
he
die
of
shame
if
he
should
find
that
it
were
really
dead
and
might
the
divinity
be
accursed
if
by
the
touch
of
his
finger
he
had
made
him
different
from
the
rest
of
mankind
the
priest
stood
erect
his
mind
all
dazed
and
scared
he
fancied
that
at
this
fresh
outburst
of
blasphemy
the
church
was
falling
down
upon
him
the
sunlight
which
had
poured
over
the
high
altar
had
gradually
spread
and
mounted
the
walls
like
ruddy
fire
flames
soared
and
licked
the
rafters
then
died
away
in
a
sanguineous
glow
and
all
at
once
the
church
became
quite
black
it
was
as
though
the
fires
of
the
setting
sun
had
burst
the
roof
asunder
pierced
the
walls
thrown
open
wide
breaches
on
every
side
to
some
exterior
foe
the
gloomy
framework
seemed
to
shake
beneath
some
violent
assault
night
was
coming
on
quickly
then
in
the
far
distance
the
priest
heard
a
gentle
murmur
rising
from
the
valley
of
les
artaud
the
time
had
been
when
he
had
not
understood
the
impassioned
language
of
those
burning
lands
where
writhed
but
knotted
withered
and
decrepit
olives
sprawling
with
crippled
limbs
protected
by
his
ignorance
he
had
passed
undisturbed
through
all
that
world
of
passion
but
his
ear
detected
the
slightest
sigh
of
the
leaves
that
lay
panting
in
the
heat
afar
off
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
the
hills
still
hot
with
the
sinking
luminary
s
farewell
seemed
to
set
themselves
in
motion
with
the
tramp
of
an
army
on
the
march
nearer
at
hand
the
scattered
rocks
the
stones
along
the
road
all
the
pebbles
in
the
valley
throbbed
and
rolled
as
if
possessed
by
a
craving
for
motion
then
the
tracts
of
ruddy
soil
the
few
fields
that
had
been
reduced
to
cultivation
seemed
to
heave
and
growl
like
rivers
that
had
burst
their
banks
bearing
along
in
a
flood
the
engenderings
of
seeds
the
births
of
roots
the
embraces
of
plants
soon
everything
was
in
motion
the
appeared
to
crawl
along
like
huge
insects
the
parched
corn
and
the
dry
grass
formed
into
dense
battalions
the
trees
stretched
out
their
boughs
like
wrestlers
making
ready
for
a
contest
the
fallen
leaves
skipped
forward
the
very
dust
on
the
road
rolled
on
it
was
a
moving
multitude
reinforced
by
fresh
recruits
at
every
step
a
legion
the
sound
of
whose
coming
went
on
in
front
of
it
an
outburst
of
passionate
life
sweeping
everything
along
in
a
mighty
whirlwind
of
fruitfulness
and
all
at
once
the
assault
began
from
the
limits
of
the
horizon
the
whole
countryside
the
hills
and
stones
and
fields
and
trees
rushed
upon
the
church
at
the
first
shock
the
building
quivered
and
cracked
the
walls
were
pierced
and
the
tiles
on
the
roof
were
thrown
down
but
the
great
christ
although
shaken
did
not
fall
a
short
respite
followed
outside
the
voices
sounded
more
angrily
and
the
priest
could
now
distinguish
human
ones
amongst
them
the
artauds
those
bastards
who
sprang
up
out
of
the
rocky
soil
with
the
persistence
of
brambles
were
now
in
their
turn
blowing
a
blast
that
reeked
of
teeming
life
they
had
planted
everywhere
forests
of
humanity
that
swallowed
up
all
around
them
they
came
up
to
the
church
they
shattered
the
door
with
a
push
and
threatened
to
block
up
the
very
nave
with
the
invading
scions
of
their
race
behind
them
came
the
beasts
the
oxen
that
tried
to
batter
down
the
walls
with
their
horns
the
flocks
of
asses
goats
and
sheep
that
dashed
against
the
ruined
church
like
living
waves
while
swarms
of
and
crickets
attacked
the
foundations
and
reduced
them
to
dust
with
their
sawlike
teeth
yet
again
on
the
other
side
there
was
desiree
s
where
the
dunghill
reeked
with
suffocating
fumes
here
the
big
cock
alexander
sounded
the
assault
and
the
hens
loosened
the
stones
with
their
beaks
and
the
rabbits
burrowed
under
the
very
altars
whilst
the
pig
too
fat
to
stir
grunted
and
waited
till
all
the
sacred
ornaments
should
be
reduced
to
warm
ashes
in
which
he
might
wallow
at
his
ease
a
great
roar
ascended
and
a
second
assault
was
delivered
the
villagers
the
animals
all
that
overflowing
sea
of
life
assailed
the
church
with
such
impetuosity
that
the
rafters
bent
and
curved
this
time
a
part
of
the
walls
tottered
and
fell
down
the
ceiling
shook
the
woodwork
of
the
windows
was
carried
away
and
the
grey
mist
of
the
evening
streamed
in
through
the
frightful
gaping
breaches
the
great
christ
now
only
clung
to
his
cross
by
the
nail
that
pierced
his
left
hand
a
mighty
shout
hailed
the
downfall
of
the
block
of
wall
yet
the
church
still
stood
there
firmly
in
spite
of
the
injuries
it
had
received
it
offered
a
stern
silent
unflinching
resistance
clutching
desperately
to
the
tiniest
stones
of
its
foundations
it
seemed
as
though
to
keep
itself
from
falling
it
required
only
the
support
of
its
slenderest
pillar
which
by
some
miracle
of
equilibration
held
up
the
gaping
roof
then
abbe
mouret
beheld
the
rude
plants
of
the
plateau
the
growths
that
had
become
hard
as
iron
amidst
the
arid
rocks
that
were
knotted
like
snakes
and
bossy
with
muscles
set
themselves
to
work
the
lichens
gnawed
away
at
the
rough
plasterwork
like
fiery
leprosy
then
the
thrust
their
roots
between
the
bricks
like
so
many
iron
wedges
the
lavenders
insinuated
hooked
fingers
into
the
loosened
stonework
and
by
slow
persistent
efforts
tore
the
blocks
asunder
the
junipers
the
rosemaries
the
prickly
holly
bushes
climbed
higher
and
battered
the
walls
with
irresistible
blows
and
even
the
grass
the
grass
whose
dry
blades
slipped
beneath
the
great
door
stiffened
itself
into
spears
and
made
its
way
down
the
nave
where
it
forced
up
the
flagstones
with
powerful
levers
it
was
a
victorious
revolt
it
was
revolutionary
nature
constructing
barricades
out
of
the
overturned
altars
and
wrecking
the
church
which
had
for
centuries
cast
too
deep
a
shadow
over
it
the
other
combatants
had
fallen
back
and
let
the
plants
the
thyme
and
the
lavender
and
the
lichens
complete
the
overthrow
of
the
building
with
their
ceaseless
little
blows
their
constant
gnawing
which
proved
more
destructive
than
the
heavier
onslaught
of
the
stronger
assailants
then
suddenly
the
end
came
the
whose
topmost
branches
had
already
forced
their
way
through
the
broken
windows
under
the
vaulted
roof
rushed
in
violently
with
its
formidable
stream
of
greenery
it
planted
itself
in
the
centre
of
the
nave
and
grew
there
monstrously
its
trunk
expanded
till
its
girth
became
so
colossal
that
it
seemed
as
though
it
would
burst
the
church
asunder
like
a
girdle
spanning
it
too
closely
its
branches
shot
out
in
knotted
arms
each
one
of
which
broke
down
a
piece
of
the
wall
or
thrust
off
a
strip
of
the
roof
and
they
went
on
multiplying
without
cessation
each
branch
ramifying
till
a
fresh
tree
sprang
out
of
each
single
knot
with
such
impetuosity
of
growth
that
the
ruins
of
the
church
pierced
through
and
through
like
a
sieve
flew
into
fragments
scattering
a
fine
dust
to
the
four
quarters
of
the
heavens
now
the
giant
tree
seemed
to
reach
the
stars
its
forest
of
branches
was
a
forest
of
legs
arms
and
breasts
full
of
sap
the
long
locks
of
women
streamed
down
from
it
men
s
heads
burst
out
from
the
bark
and
up
aloft
pairs
of
lovers
lying
languid
by
the
edges
of
their
nests
filled
the
air
with
the
music
of
their
delights
a
final
blast
of
the
storm
which
had
broken
over
the
church
swept
away
the
dust
of
its
remains
the
pulpit
and
the
which
had
been
ground
into
powder
the
lacerated
holy
pictures
the
shattered
sacred
vessels
all
the
litter
at
which
the
legion
of
sparrows
that
had
once
dwelt
amongst
the
tiles
was
eagerly
pecking
the
great
christ
torn
from
the
cross
hung
for
a
moment
from
one
of
the
streaming
women
s
curls
and
then
was
whirled
away
into
the
black
darkness
in
the
depths
of
which
it
sank
with
a
loud
crash
the
tree
of
life
had
pierced
the
heavens
it
overtopped
the
stars
abbe
mouret
was
filled
with
the
mad
joy
of
an
accursed
spirit
at
the
sight
before
him
the
church
was
vanquished
god
no
longer
had
a
house
and
thenceforward
god
could
no
longer
trouble
him
he
was
free
to
rejoin
albine
since
it
was
she
who
triumphed
he
laughed
at
himself
for
having
declared
an
hour
previously
that
the
church
would
swallow
up
the
whole
earth
with
its
shadow
the
earth
indeed
had
avenged
itself
by
consuming
the
church
the
mad
laughter
into
which
he
broke
had
the
effect
of
suddenly
awakening
him
from
his
hallucination
he
gazed
stupidly
round
the
nave
which
the
evening
shadows
were
slowly
darkening
through
the
windows
he
could
see
patches
of
sky
and
he
was
about
to
stretch
out
his
arms
to
feel
the
walls
when
he
heard
desiree
calling
to
him
from
the
serge
serge
are
you
there
why
don
t
you
answer
i
have
been
looking
for
you
for
this
last
she
came
in
she
was
holding
a
lighted
lamp
and
the
priest
then
saw
that
the
church
was
still
standing
he
could
no
longer
understand
anything
but
remained
in
a
horrible
state
of
doubt
betwixt
the
unconquerable
church
springing
up
again
from
its
ashes
and
albine
the
who
could
shake
the
very
throne
of
god
by
a
single
breath
x
desiree
came
up
to
him
full
of
merry
chatter
are
you
there
are
you
there
she
cried
why
are
you
playing
at
i
called
out
to
you
at
the
top
of
my
voice
at
least
a
dozen
times
i
thought
you
must
have
gone
she
pried
into
all
the
gloomy
corners
with
an
inquisitive
glance
and
even
stepped
up
to
the
as
though
she
had
expected
to
surprise
some
one
hiding
there
then
she
came
back
to
serge
disappointed
and
continued
so
you
are
quite
alone
have
you
been
asleep
what
amusement
do
you
find
in
shutting
yourself
up
all
alone
in
the
dark
come
along
it
is
time
we
went
to
the
abbe
drew
his
feverish
hands
across
his
brow
to
wipe
away
the
traces
of
the
thoughts
which
he
feared
were
plain
for
all
the
world
to
read
he
fumbled
mechanically
at
the
buttons
of
his
cassock
which
seemed
to
him
all
disarranged
then
he
followed
his
sister
with
face
and
never
a
sign
of
emotion
stiffened
by
that
priestly
energy
which
throws
the
dignity
of
sacerdotalism
like
a
veil
over
the
agonies
of
the
flesh
desiree
did
not
even
suspect
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
him
she
simply
said
as
they
entered
the
i
have
had
such
a
good
sleep
but
you
have
been
talking
too
much
and
have
made
yourself
quite
in
the
evening
after
dinner
brother
archangias
came
in
to
have
his
game
of
cards
with
la
teuse
he
was
in
a
very
merry
mood
that
night
and
when
the
brother
was
merry
it
was
his
habit
to
prod
la
teuse
in
the
sides
with
his
big
fists
an
attention
which
she
returned
by
heartily
boxing
his
ears
this
skirmishing
made
them
both
laugh
with
a
laughter
that
shook
the
very
ceiling
the
brother
too
when
he
was
in
these
gay
humours
would
devise
all
kinds
of
pranks
he
would
try
to
smash
plates
with
his
nose
and
would
offer
to
wager
that
he
could
break
through
the
door
in
fashion
he
would
also
empty
the
snuff
out
of
his
box
into
the
old
servant
s
coffee
or
would
thrust
a
handful
of
pebbles
down
her
neck
the
merest
trifle
would
give
rise
to
these
noisy
outbursts
of
gaiety
in
the
very
midst
of
his
wonted
surliness
some
little
incident
at
which
nobody
else
laughed
often
sufficed
to
throw
him
into
a
state
of
wild
hilarity
make
him
stamp
his
feet
twirl
himself
round
like
a
top
and
hold
in
his
splitting
sides
what
is
it
that
makes
you
so
gay
la
teuse
inquired
he
made
no
reply
bestriding
a
chair
and
galloping
round
the
table
on
it
well
well
go
on
making
a
baby
of
yourself
said
the
old
woman
and
my
gracious
what
a
big
baby
you
are
if
the
lord
is
looking
at
you
he
must
be
very
well
pleased
with
you
the
brother
had
just
slipped
off
the
chair
and
was
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
legs
in
the
air
he
does
see
me
and
is
pleased
to
see
me
as
i
am
it
is
his
wish
that
i
should
be
gay
when
he
wishes
me
to
be
merry
for
a
time
he
rings
a
bell
in
my
body
and
then
i
begin
to
roll
about
and
all
paradise
smiles
as
it
watches
he
dragged
himself
on
his
back
to
the
wall
and
then
supporting
himself
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
he
hoisted
up
his
body
as
high
as
he
could
and
began
drumming
on
the
wall
with
his
heels
his
cassock
slipped
down
and
exposed
to
view
his
black
breeches
which
were
patched
at
the
knees
with
green
cloth
look
monsieur
le
cure
he
said
you
see
how
high
i
can
reach
with
my
heels
i
dare
bet
that
you
couldn
t
do
as
much
come
look
amused
and
laugh
a
little
it
is
better
to
drag
oneself
along
on
one
s
back
than
to
think
about
a
hussy
as
you
are
always
doing
you
know
what
i
mean
for
my
part
when
i
take
to
scratching
myself
i
imagine
myself
to
be
god
s
dog
and
that
s
what
makes
me
say
that
all
paradise
looks
out
of
the
windows
to
smile
at
me
you
might
just
as
well
laugh
too
monsieur
le
cure
it
s
all
done
for
the
saints
and
you
see
here
s
a
for
saint
joseph
here
s
another
for
saint
michael
and
another
for
saint
john
and
another
for
saint
mark
and
another
for
saint
matthew
so
he
went
on
enumerating
a
whole
string
of
saints
and
turning
somersaults
all
round
the
room
abbe
mouret
who
had
been
sitting
in
perfect
silence
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
edge
of
the
table
was
at
last
constrained
to
smile
as
a
rule
the
brother
s
sportiveness
only
disquieted
him
la
teuse
as
archangias
rolled
within
her
reach
kicked
at
him
with
her
foot
come
she
said
are
we
to
have
our
game
his
only
reply
was
a
grunt
then
upon
all
fours
he
sprang
towards
la
teuse
as
if
he
meant
to
bite
her
but
in
lieu
thereof
he
spat
upon
her
petticoats
let
me
alone
will
you
she
cried
what
are
you
up
to
now
i
begin
to
think
you
have
gone
crazy
what
it
is
that
amuses
you
so
much
i
can
t
what
makes
me
gay
is
my
own
affair
he
replied
rising
to
his
feet
and
shaking
himself
it
is
not
necessary
to
explain
it
to
you
la
teuse
however
as
you
want
a
game
of
cards
let
us
have
then
the
game
began
it
was
a
terrible
struggle
the
brother
hurled
his
cards
upon
the
table
whenever
he
cried
out
the
windows
shook
sonorously
la
teuse
at
last
seemed
to
be
winning
she
had
secured
three
aces
for
some
time
already
and
was
casting
longing
eyes
at
the
fourth
but
brother
archangias
began
to
indulge
in
fresh
outbursts
of
gaiety
he
pushed
up
the
table
at
the
risk
of
breaking
the
lamp
he
cheated
outrageously
and
defended
himself
by
means
of
the
most
abominable
lies
just
for
a
joke
said
he
then
he
suddenly
began
to
sing
the
vespers
beating
time
on
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
his
cards
when
his
gaiety
reached
a
climax
and
he
could
find
no
adequate
means
of
expressing
it
he
always
took
to
chanting
the
vespers
which
he
repeated
for
hours
at
a
time
la
teuse
who
well
knew
his
habits
cried
out
to
him
amidst
the
bellowing
with
which
he
shook
the
room
make
a
little
less
noise
do
it
is
quite
distracting
you
are
much
too
lively
but
he
set
to
work
on
the
abbe
mouret
had
now
seated
himself
by
the
window
he
appeared
to
pay
no
attention
to
what
went
on
around
him
apparently
neither
hearing
nor
seeing
anything
of
it
at
dinner
he
had
eaten
with
his
ordinary
appetite
and
had
even
managed
to
reply
to
desiree
s
everlasting
rattle
of
questions
but
now
he
had
given
up
the
struggle
his
strength
at
an
end
racked
exhausted
as
he
was
by
the
internal
tempest
that
still
raged
within
him
he
even
lacked
the
courage
to
rise
from
his
seat
and
go
upstairs
to
his
own
room
moreover
he
was
afraid
that
if
he
turned
his
face
towards
the
lamplight
the
tears
which
he
could
no
longer
keep
from
his
eyes
would
be
noticed
so
he
pressed
his
face
close
to
the
window
and
gazed
out
into
the
darkness
growing
gradually
more
drowsy
sinking
into
a
kind
of
nightmare
stupor
brother
archangias
still
busy
at
his
winked
and
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
dozing
priest
what
s
the
matter
asked
la
teuse
the
brother
replied
by
a
yet
more
significant
wink
well
what
do
you
mean
can
t
you
speak
ah
there
s
a
king
that
s
capital
so
i
take
your
the
brother
laid
down
his
cards
bent
over
the
table
and
whispered
close
to
la
teuse
s
face
that
hussy
has
been
i
know
that
well
enough
answered
la
teuse
i
saw
her
go
with
mademoiselle
into
the
at
this
he
gave
her
a
terrible
look
and
shook
his
fist
in
her
face
you
saw
her
and
you
let
her
come
in
you
ought
to
have
called
me
and
we
would
have
hung
her
up
by
the
feet
to
a
nail
in
your
but
at
this
the
old
woman
lost
her
temper
and
lowering
her
voice
solely
in
order
that
she
might
not
awaken
abbe
mouret
she
replied
don
t
you
go
talking
about
hanging
people
up
in
my
kitchen
i
certainly
saw
her
and
i
even
kept
my
back
turned
when
she
went
to
join
his
reverence
in
the
church
when
the
catechising
was
over
but
all
that
was
no
business
of
mine
i
had
my
cooking
to
attend
to
as
for
the
girl
herself
i
detest
her
but
if
his
reverence
wishes
to
see
her
why
she
is
welcome
to
come
whenever
she
pleases
i
d
let
her
in
myself
if
you
were
to
do
that
la
teuse
retorted
the
brother
ragefully
i
would
strangle
you
that
i
but
she
laughed
at
him
don
t
talk
any
of
your
nonsense
to
me
my
man
don
t
you
know
that
it
is
forbidden
you
to
lay
your
hands
upon
a
woman
just
as
it
s
forbidden
for
a
donkey
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
just
you
try
to
strangle
me
and
you
ll
see
what
i
ll
do
but
do
be
quiet
now
and
let
us
finish
the
game
see
here
s
another
but
the
brother
holding
up
a
card
went
on
growling
she
must
have
come
by
some
road
that
the
devil
alone
knows
for
me
to
have
missed
her
every
afternoon
i
go
and
keep
guard
up
yonder
by
the
paradou
if
ever
i
find
them
together
again
i
will
acquaint
the
hussy
with
a
stout
dogwood
stick
which
i
have
cut
expressly
for
her
benefit
and
i
shall
keep
a
watch
in
the
church
as
well
he
played
his
card
which
la
teuse
took
with
a
knave
then
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
again
burst
into
one
of
his
loud
laughs
he
did
not
seem
to
be
able
to
work
himself
up
into
a
genuine
rage
that
evening
well
well
he
grumbled
never
mind
even
if
she
did
see
him
she
had
a
smacking
fall
on
her
nose
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
la
teuse
it
was
raining
you
know
i
was
standing
by
the
when
i
caught
sight
of
her
coming
down
from
the
church
she
was
walking
along
quite
straight
and
upright
in
her
fashion
in
spite
of
the
pouring
rain
but
when
she
got
into
the
road
she
tumbled
down
full
length
no
doubt
because
the
ground
was
so
slippery
oh
how
i
did
laugh
how
i
did
laugh
i
clapped
my
hands
too
when
she
picked
herself
up
again
i
saw
she
was
bleeding
at
the
wrist
i
shall
feel
happy
over
it
for
a
week
i
can
not
think
of
her
lying
there
on
the
ground
without
feeling
the
greatest
then
turning
his
attention
to
the
game
he
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
began
to
chant
the
when
he
had
got
to
the
end
of
it
he
began
it
all
over
again
the
game
came
to
a
conclusion
in
the
midst
of
this
dirge
it
was
he
who
was
beaten
but
his
defeat
did
not
seem
to
vex
him
in
the
least
when
la
teuse
had
locked
the
door
behind
him
after
first
awakening
abbe
mouret
his
voice
could
still
be
heard
as
he
went
his
way
through
the
black
night
singing
the
last
verse
of
the
psalm
ipse
redimet
israel
ex
omnibus
iniquitatibus
with
extraordinary
jubilation
xi
that
night
abbe
mouret
slept
very
heavily
when
he
opened
his
eyes
in
the
morning
later
than
usual
his
face
and
hands
were
wet
with
tears
he
had
been
weeping
all
through
the
night
while
he
slept
he
did
not
say
his
mass
that
day
in
spite
of
his
long
rest
he
had
not
recovered
from
his
excessive
weariness
of
the
previous
evening
and
he
remained
in
his
bedroom
till
noon
sitting
in
a
chair
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
the
condition
of
stupor
into
which
he
more
and
more
deeply
sank
took
all
sensation
of
suffering
away
from
him
he
was
conscious
only
of
a
great
void
and
blank
as
he
sat
there
overpowered
and
benumbed
even
to
read
his
breviary
cost
him
a
great
effort
its
latin
seemed
to
him
a
barbarous
language
which
he
would
never
again
be
able
to
pronounce
having
tossed
the
book
upon
his
bed
he
gazed
for
hours
through
his
open
window
at
the
surrounding
country
in
the
far
distance
he
saw
the
long
wall
of
the
paradou
creeping
like
a
thin
white
line
amongst
the
gloomy
patches
of
the
pine
plantations
to
the
crest
of
the
hills
on
the
left
hidden
by
one
of
those
plantations
was
the
breach
he
could
not
see
it
but
he
knew
it
was
there
he
remembered
every
bit
of
bramble
scattered
among
the
stones
on
the
previous
night
he
would
not
have
thus
dared
to
gaze
upon
that
dreaded
scene
but
now
with
impunity
he
allowed
himself
to
trace
the
whole
line
of
the
wall
as
it
emerged
again
and
again
from
the
clumps
of
verdure
which
here
and
there
concealed
it
his
blood
pulsed
none
the
faster
for
this
scrutiny
temptation
as
though
disdaining
his
present
weakness
left
him
free
from
attack
forsaken
by
the
divine
grace
he
was
incapable
of
entering
upon
any
struggle
the
thought
of
sin
could
no
longer
even
impassion
him
it
was
sheer
stupor
alone
that
now
rendered
him
willing
to
accept
that
which
he
had
the
day
before
so
strenuously
refused
at
one
moment
he
caught
himself
talking
aloud
and
saying
that
since
the
breach
in
the
wall
was
still
open
he
would
go
and
join
albine
at
sunset
this
decision
brought
him
a
slight
feeling
of
worry
but
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
do
otherwise
she
was
expecting
him
to
go
and
she
was
his
wife
when
he
tried
to
picture
her
face
he
could
only
imagine
her
as
very
pale
and
a
long
way
off
then
he
felt
a
little
uneasy
as
to
their
future
manner
of
life
together
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
remain
in
the
neighbourhood
they
would
have
to
go
away
somewhere
without
any
one
knowing
anything
about
it
and
then
when
they
had
managed
to
conceal
themselves
they
would
need
a
deal
of
money
in
order
to
live
happily
and
comfortably
he
tried
a
score
of
times
to
hit
upon
some
scheme
by
which
they
could
get
away
and
live
together
like
happy
lovers
but
he
could
devise
nothing
satisfactory
now
that
he
was
no
longer
wild
with
passion
the
practical
side
of
the
situation
alarmed
him
he
found
himself
in
all
his
weakness
face
to
face
with
a
complicated
problem
with
which
he
was
incompetent
to
grapple
where
could
they
get
horses
for
their
escape
and
if
they
went
away
on
foot
would
they
not
be
stopped
and
detained
as
vagabonds
was
he
capable
of
securing
any
employment
by
which
he
could
earn
bread
for
his
wife
he
had
never
been
taught
any
kind
of
trade
he
was
quite
ignorant
of
actual
life
he
ransacked
his
memory
and
he
could
remember
nothing
but
strings
of
prayers
details
of
ceremonies
and
pages
of
bouvier
s
instruction
theologique
which
he
had
learned
by
heart
at
the
seminary
he
worried
too
over
matters
of
no
real
concern
he
asked
himself
whether
he
would
dare
to
give
his
arm
to
his
wife
in
the
street
he
certainly
could
not
walk
with
a
woman
clinging
to
his
arm
he
would
surely
appear
so
strange
and
awkward
that
every
one
would
turn
round
to
stare
at
him
they
would
guess
that
he
was
a
priest
and
would
insult
albine
it
would
be
vain
for
him
to
try
to
obliterate
the
traces
of
his
priesthood
he
would
always
wear
that
mournful
pallor
and
carry
the
odour
of
incense
about
with
him
and
what
if
he
should
have
children
some
day
as
this
thought
suddenly
occurred
to
him
he
quite
started
he
felt
a
strange
repugnance
at
the
very
idea
he
felt
sure
that
he
should
not
care
for
any
children
that
might
be
born
to
him
suppose
there
were
two
of
them
a
little
boy
and
a
little
girl
he
could
never
let
them
get
on
his
knees
it
would
distress
him
to
feel
their
hands
clutching
at
his
clothes
the
thought
of
the
little
girl
troubled
him
the
most
he
could
already
see
womanly
tenderness
shining
in
the
depths
of
her
big
childish
eyes
no
no
he
would
have
no
children
nevertheless
he
resolved
that
he
would
flee
with
albine
that
evening
but
when
the
evening
came
he
felt
too
weary
so
he
deferred
his
flight
till
the
next
morning
and
the
next
morning
he
made
a
fresh
pretext
for
delay
he
could
not
leave
his
sister
alone
with
la
teuse
he
would
prepare
a
letter
directing
that
she
should
be
taken
to
her
uncle
pascal
s
for
three
days
he
was
ever
on
the
point
of
writing
that
letter
and
the
paper
and
pen
and
ink
were
lying
ready
on
the
table
in
his
room
then
on
the
third
day
he
went
off
leaving
the
letter
unwritten
he
took
up
his
hat
quite
suddenly
and
set
off
for
the
paradou
in
a
state
of
mingled
stupor
and
resignation
as
though
he
were
unwillingly
performing
some
compulsory
task
which
he
saw
no
means
of
avoiding
albine
s
image
was
now
effaced
from
his
memory
he
no
longer
beheld
her
but
he
was
driven
on
by
old
resolves
whose
lingering
influence
though
they
themselves
were
dead
still
worked
upon
him
in
his
silence
and
loneliness
he
took
no
pains
to
escape
notice
when
he
set
foot
out
of
doors
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
village
to
talk
for
a
moment
to
rosalie
she
told
him
that
her
baby
was
suffering
from
convulsions
but
she
laughed
as
she
spoke
with
the
laugh
that
was
natural
to
her
then
he
struck
out
through
the
rocks
and
walked
straight
on
towards
the
breach
in
the
wall
by
force
of
habit
he
had
brought
his
breviary
with
him
finding
the
way
long
he
opened
the
book
and
read
the
regulation
prayers
when
he
put
it
back
again
under
his
arm
he
had
forgotten
the
paradou
he
went
on
walking
steadily
thinking
about
a
new
chasuble
that
he
wished
to
purchase
to
replace
the
old
one
which
was
certainly
falling
into
shreds
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
saving
up
pieces
and
he
calculated
that
by
the
end
of
seven
months
he
would
have
got
the
necessary
amount
of
money
together
he
had
reached
the
hills
when
the
song
of
a
peasant
in
the
distance
reminded
him
of
a
canticle
which
had
been
familiar
to
him
at
the
seminary
he
tried
to
recall
the
first
lines
of
it
but
his
recollection
failed
him
it
vexed
him
to
find
that
his
memory
was
so
poor
and
when
at
last
he
succeeded
in
remembering
the
words
he
found
a
soothing
pleasure
in
humming
the
verses
which
came
back
to
his
mind
one
by
one
it
was
a
hymn
of
homage
to
mary
he
smiled
as
though
some
soft
breath
from
the
days
of
his
childhood
were
playing
upon
his
face
ah
how
happy
he
had
then
been
why
shouldn
t
he
be
as
happy
again
he
had
not
grown
any
bigger
he
wanted
nothing
more
than
the
same
old
happiness
unruffled
peace
a
nook
in
the
chapel
where
his
knees
marked
his
place
a
life
of
seclusion
enlivened
by
the
delightful
puerilities
of
childhood
little
by
little
he
raised
his
voice
singing
the
canticle
in
flutelike
tones
when
he
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
breach
immediately
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
he
seemed
surprised
then
the
smile
dying
from
his
face
he
murmured
quietly
albine
must
be
expecting
me
the
sun
is
already
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
push
some
stones
aside
to
make
himself
a
passage
he
was
startled
by
a
snore
he
sprang
down
again
he
had
only
just
missed
setting
his
foot
upon
the
very
face
of
brother
archangias
who
was
lying
on
the
ground
there
sleeping
soundly
slumber
had
overtaken
him
while
he
kept
guard
over
the
entrance
to
the
paradou
he
barred
the
approach
to
it
lying
at
full
length
before
its
threshold
with
arms
and
legs
spread
out
his
right
hand
thrown
back
behind
his
head
still
clutched
his
dogwood
staff
which
he
seemed
to
brandish
like
a
fiery
sword
and
he
snored
loudly
in
the
midst
of
the
brambles
his
face
exposed
to
the
sun
without
a
quiver
on
his
tanned
skin
a
swarm
of
big
flies
was
hovering
over
his
open
mouth
abbe
mouret
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
he
envied
the
slumber
of
that
saint
he
wished
to
drive
the
flies
away
but
they
persistently
returned
and
clung
around
the
purple
lips
of
the
brother
who
was
quite
unconscious
of
their
presence
then
the
abbe
strode
over
his
big
body
and
entered
the
paradou
xii
albine
was
seated
on
a
patch
of
grass
a
few
paces
away
from
the
wall
she
sprang
up
as
she
caught
sight
of
serge
ah
you
have
come
she
cried
trembling
from
head
to
foot
yes
he
answered
calmly
i
have
she
flung
herself
upon
his
neck
but
she
did
not
kiss
him
to
her
bare
arms
the
beads
of
his
neckband
seemed
very
cold
she
scrutinised
him
already
feeling
uneasy
and
resuming
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
don
t
you
kiss
my
cheeks
as
you
used
to
do
oh
if
you
are
ill
i
will
cure
you
once
again
now
that
you
are
here
all
our
old
happiness
will
return
there
will
be
no
more
wretchedness
see
i
am
smiling
you
must
smile
too
but
his
face
remained
grave
i
have
been
troubled
too
she
went
on
i
am
still
quite
pale
am
i
not
for
a
whole
week
i
have
been
living
on
that
patch
of
grass
where
you
found
me
i
wanted
one
thing
only
to
see
you
coming
back
through
the
breach
in
the
wall
at
every
sound
i
sprang
up
and
rushed
to
meet
you
but
alas
it
was
not
you
i
heard
it
was
only
the
leaves
rustling
in
the
wind
but
i
was
sure
that
you
would
come
i
should
have
waited
for
you
for
then
she
asked
him
do
you
still
love
me
yes
he
answered
i
love
you
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
feeling
rather
ill
at
ease
and
deep
silence
fell
between
them
serge
who
evinced
perfect
calmness
did
not
attempt
to
break
it
albine
twice
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
but
closed
it
immediately
surprised
at
the
words
that
rose
to
her
lips
she
could
summon
up
nothing
but
expressions
tinged
with
bitterness
she
felt
tears
welling
into
her
eyes
what
could
be
the
matter
with
her
that
she
did
not
feel
happy
now
that
her
love
had
come
back
listen
to
me
she
said
at
last
we
must
not
stay
here
it
is
that
hole
that
freezes
us
let
us
go
back
to
our
old
home
give
me
your
they
plunged
into
the
depths
of
the
paradou
autumn
was
fast
approaching
and
the
trees
seemed
anxious
as
they
stood
there
with
their
yellowing
crests
from
which
the
leaves
were
falling
one
by
one
the
paths
were
already
littered
with
dead
foliage
soaked
with
moisture
which
gave
out
a
sound
as
of
sighing
beneath
one
s
tread
and
away
beyond
the
lawns
misty
vapour
ascended
throwing
a
mourning
veil
over
the
blue
distance
and
the
whole
garden
was
wrapped
in
silence
broken
only
by
some
sorrowful
moans
that
sounded
quiveringly
serge
began
to
shiver
beneath
the
avenue
of
tall
trees
along
which
they
were
walking
how
cold
it
is
here
said
he
in
an
undertone
you
are
cold
indeed
murmured
albine
sadly
my
hand
is
no
longer
able
to
warm
you
shall
i
wrap
you
round
with
part
of
my
dress
come
all
our
love
will
now
be
born
she
led
him
to
the
parterre
the
the
great
rosary
was
still
fragrant
with
perfume
but
there
was
a
tinge
of
bitterness
in
the
scent
of
the
surviving
blossoms
and
their
foliage
which
had
expanded
in
wild
profusion
lay
strewn
upon
the
ground
serge
displayed
such
unwillingness
to
enter
the
tangled
jungle
that
they
lingered
on
its
borders
trying
to
detect
in
the
distance
the
paths
along
which
they
had
passed
in
the
albine
recollected
every
little
nook
she
pointed
to
the
grotto
where
the
marble
woman
lay
sleeping
to
the
hanging
screens
of
honeysuckle
and
clematis
the
fields
of
violets
the
fountain
that
spurted
out
crimson
carnations
the
steps
down
which
flowed
golden
gilliflowers
the
ruined
colonnade
in
the
midst
of
which
the
lilies
were
rearing
a
snowy
pavilion
it
was
there
that
they
had
been
born
again
beneath
the
sunlight
and
she
recapitulated
every
detail
of
that
first
day
together
how
they
had
walked
and
how
fragrant
had
been
the
air
beneath
the
cool
shade
serge
seemed
to
be
listening
but
he
suddenly
asked
a
question
which
showed
that
he
had
not
understood
her
the
slight
shiver
which
made
his
face
turn
pale
never
left
him
then
she
led
him
towards
the
orchard
but
they
could
not
reach
it
the
stream
was
too
much
swollen
serge
no
longer
thought
of
taking
albine
upon
his
back
and
lightly
bounding
across
with
her
to
the
other
side
yet
there
the
and
the
were
still
laden
with
fruit
and
the
vines
now
with
scantier
foliage
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
their
gleaming
clusters
each
grape
freckled
by
the
sun
s
caress
ah
how
they
had
gambolled
beneath
the
appetising
shade
of
those
ancient
trees
what
merry
children
had
they
then
been
albine
smiled
as
she
thought
of
how
she
had
clambered
up
into
the
that
had
broken
down
beneath
her
he
serge
must
at
least
remember
what
a
quantity
of
plums
they
had
eaten
he
only
answered
by
a
nod
he
already
seemed
quite
weary
the
orchard
with
its
green
depths
and
chaos
of
mossy
trunks
disquieted
him
and
suggested
to
his
mind
some
dark
dank
spot
teeming
with
snakes
and
nettles
then
she
led
him
to
the
where
he
had
to
take
a
few
steps
amongst
the
grass
it
reached
to
his
shoulders
now
and
seemed
to
him
like
a
swarm
of
clinging
arms
that
tried
to
bind
his
limbs
and
pull
him
down
and
drown
him
beneath
an
endless
sea
of
greenery
he
begged
albine
to
go
no
further
she
was
walking
on
in
front
and
at
first
she
did
not
stop
but
when
she
saw
how
distressed
he
appeared
she
halted
and
came
back
and
stood
beside
him
she
also
was
growing
gradually
more
and
at
last
she
shuddered
like
himself
still
she
went
on
talking
with
a
sweeping
gesture
she
pointed
out
to
him
the
streams
the
rows
of
willows
the
grassy
expanse
stretching
far
away
towards
the
horizon
all
that
had
formerly
been
theirs
for
whole
days
they
had
lived
there
over
yonder
between
those
three
willows
by
the
water
s
edge
they
had
played
at
being
lovers
and
they
would
then
have
been
delighted
if
the
grass
had
been
taller
than
themselves
so
that
they
might
have
lost
themselves
in
its
depths
and
have
been
the
more
secluded
like
larks
nesting
at
the
bottom
of
a
field
of
corn
why
then
did
he
tremble
so
when
the
tip
of
his
foot
just
sank
into
the
grass
then
she
led
him
to
the
forest
but
the
huge
trees
seemed
to
inspire
serge
with
still
greater
dread
he
did
not
know
them
again
so
sternly
solemn
seemed
their
bare
black
trunks
here
more
than
anywhere
else
amidst
those
austere
columns
through
which
the
light
now
freely
streamed
the
past
seemed
quite
dead
the
first
rains
had
washed
the
traces
of
their
footsteps
from
the
sandy
paths
the
winds
had
swept
every
other
lingering
memorial
into
the
underbrush
but
albine
with
grief
at
her
throat
shot
out
a
protesting
glance
she
could
still
plainly
see
their
lightest
footprints
on
the
sandy
gravel
and
as
they
passed
each
bush
the
warmth
with
which
they
had
once
brushed
against
it
surged
to
her
cheeks
with
eyes
full
of
soft
entreaty
she
still
strove
to
awaken
serge
s
memory
it
was
along
that
path
that
they
had
walked
in
silence
full
of
emotion
but
as
yet
not
daring
to
confess
that
they
loved
one
another
it
was
in
that
clearing
that
they
had
lingered
one
evening
till
very
late
watching
the
stars
which
had
rained
upon
them
like
golden
drops
of
warmth
farther
beneath
that
oak
they
had
exchanged
their
first
kiss
its
fragrance
still
clung
to
the
tree
and
the
very
moss
still
remembered
it
it
was
false
to
say
that
the
forest
had
become
voiceless
and
bare
serge
however
turned
away
his
head
that
he
might
escape
the
gaze
of
albine
s
eyes
which
oppressed
him
then
she
led
him
to
the
great
rocks
there
perhaps
he
would
no
longer
shudder
with
that
appearance
of
debility
which
so
distressed
her
at
that
hour
the
rocks
were
still
warm
with
the
red
glow
of
the
setting
sun
they
still
wore
an
aspect
of
tragic
passion
with
their
hot
ledges
of
stone
whereon
the
fleshy
plants
writhed
monstrously
without
speaking
a
word
without
even
turning
her
head
albine
led
serge
up
the
rough
ascent
wishing
to
take
him
ever
higher
and
higher
far
up
beyond
the
springs
till
they
should
emerge
into
the
full
light
on
the
summit
they
would
there
see
the
cedar
beneath
whose
shade
they
had
first
felt
the
thrill
of
desire
and
there
amidst
the
glowing
stones
they
would
assuredly
find
passion
once
more
but
serge
soon
began
to
stumble
pitiably
he
could
walk
no
further
he
fell
a
first
time
on
his
knees
albine
by
a
mighty
effort
raised
him
and
for
a
moment
carried
him
along
but
afterwards
he
fell
again
and
remained
quite
overcome
on
the
ground
in
front
of
him
beneath
him
spread
the
vast
paradou
you
have
lied
cried
albine
you
love
me
no
longer
she
burst
into
tears
as
she
stood
there
by
his
side
feeling
that
she
could
not
carry
him
any
higher
there
was
no
sign
of
anger
in
her
now
she
was
simply
weeping
over
their
dying
love
serge
lay
dazed
and
stupefied
the
garden
is
all
dead
i
feel
so
very
cold
he
murmured
but
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
showed
him
the
paradou
look
at
it
ah
it
is
your
eyes
that
are
dead
your
ears
and
your
limbs
and
your
whole
body
you
have
passed
by
all
the
scenes
of
our
happiness
without
seeing
them
or
hearing
them
or
feeling
their
presence
you
have
done
nothing
but
slip
and
stumble
and
now
you
have
fallen
down
here
in
sheer
weariness
and
boredom
you
love
me
no
he
protested
but
in
a
gentle
quiet
fashion
then
for
the
first
time
she
spoke
out
passionately
be
quiet
as
if
the
garden
could
ever
die
it
will
sleep
for
the
winter
but
it
will
wake
up
again
in
may
and
will
restore
to
us
all
the
love
we
have
entrusted
to
its
keeping
our
kisses
will
blossom
again
amongst
the
and
our
vows
will
bud
again
with
the
trees
and
plants
if
you
could
only
see
it
and
understand
it
you
would
know
that
it
throbs
with
even
deeper
passion
and
loves
even
more
absorbingly
at
this
when
it
falls
asleep
in
its
fruitfulness
but
you
love
me
no
more
and
so
you
can
no
longer
he
raised
his
eyes
to
her
as
if
begging
her
not
to
be
angry
his
face
was
pinched
and
pale
with
an
expression
of
childish
fear
the
sound
of
her
voice
made
him
tremble
he
ended
by
persuading
her
to
rest
a
little
while
by
his
side
they
could
talk
quietly
and
discuss
matters
then
with
the
paradou
spreading
out
in
front
of
them
they
began
to
speak
of
their
love
but
without
even
touching
one
another
s
fingers
i
love
you
indeed
i
love
you
said
serge
in
his
calm
quiet
voice
if
i
did
not
love
you
i
should
not
be
here
i
should
not
have
come
i
am
very
weary
it
is
true
i
don
t
know
why
i
thought
i
should
find
that
pleasant
warmth
again
of
which
the
mere
memory
was
so
delightful
but
i
am
cold
the
garden
seems
quite
black
i
can
not
see
anything
of
what
i
left
here
but
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
trying
hard
to
be
as
you
would
wish
me
and
to
please
you
love
me
no
longer
albine
repeated
once
more
yes
i
do
love
you
i
suffered
grievously
the
other
day
after
i
had
driven
you
away
oh
i
loved
you
with
such
passion
that
had
you
come
back
and
thrown
yourself
in
my
arms
i
should
almost
have
crushed
you
to
death
and
for
hours
your
image
remained
present
before
me
when
i
shut
my
eyes
you
gleamed
out
with
all
the
brightness
of
the
sun
and
threw
a
flame
around
me
then
i
trampled
down
every
obstacle
and
came
he
remained
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
in
thought
then
he
spoke
again
and
now
my
arms
feel
as
though
they
were
broken
if
i
tried
to
clasp
you
i
could
not
hold
you
i
should
let
you
fall
wait
till
this
shudder
has
passed
away
give
me
your
hands
and
let
me
kiss
them
again
be
gentle
and
do
not
look
at
me
with
such
angry
eyes
help
me
to
find
my
heart
he
spoke
with
such
genuine
sadness
such
evident
longing
to
begin
the
past
anew
that
albine
was
touched
for
a
moment
all
her
wonted
gentleness
returned
to
her
and
she
questioned
him
anxiously
what
is
the
matter
with
you
what
makes
you
so
ill
i
do
not
know
it
is
as
though
all
my
blood
had
left
my
veins
just
now
as
i
was
coming
here
i
felt
as
if
some
one
had
flung
a
robe
of
ice
around
my
shoulders
which
turned
me
into
stone
from
head
to
foot
i
have
felt
it
before
but
where
i
don
t
she
interrupted
him
with
a
kindly
laugh
you
are
a
child
you
have
caught
cold
that
s
all
at
any
rate
it
is
not
i
that
you
are
afraid
of
is
it
we
won
t
stop
in
the
garden
during
the
winter
like
a
couple
of
wild
things
we
will
go
wherever
you
like
to
some
big
town
we
can
love
each
other
there
amongst
all
the
people
as
quietly
as
amongst
the
trees
you
will
see
that
i
can
be
something
else
than
a
wilding
for
ever
bird
and
tramping
about
for
hours
when
i
was
a
little
girl
i
used
to
wear
embroidered
skirts
and
fine
stockings
and
laces
and
all
kinds
of
finery
i
dare
say
you
never
heard
of
he
was
not
listening
to
her
he
suddenly
gave
vent
to
a
little
cry
and
said
ah
now
i
recollect
she
asked
him
what
he
meant
but
he
would
not
answer
her
he
had
just
remembered
the
feeling
he
had
long
ago
experienced
in
the
chapel
of
the
seminary
that
was
the
icy
robe
enwrapping
his
shoulders
and
turning
him
to
stone
and
then
his
life
as
a
priest
took
complete
possession
of
his
thoughts
the
vague
recollections
which
had
haunted
him
as
he
walked
from
les
artaud
to
the
paradou
became
more
and
more
distinct
and
assumed
complete
mastery
over
him
while
albine
talked
on
of
the
happy
life
that
they
would
lead
together
he
heard
the
tinkling
of
the
sanctuary
bell
that
signalled
the
elevation
of
the
host
and
he
saw
the
monstrance
trace
gleaming
crosses
over
the
heads
of
kneeling
multitudes
and
for
your
sake
albine
was
saying
i
will
put
on
my
broidered
skirts
again
i
want
you
to
be
bright
and
gay
we
will
try
to
find
something
to
make
you
lively
perhaps
you
will
love
me
better
when
you
see
me
looking
beautiful
and
prettily
dressed
like
a
fine
lady
i
will
wear
my
comb
properly
and
won
t
let
my
hair
fall
wildly
about
my
neck
any
more
and
i
won
t
roll
my
sleeves
up
over
my
elbows
i
will
fasten
my
dress
so
as
to
hide
my
shoulders
i
still
know
how
to
bow
and
how
to
walk
along
quite
properly
yes
i
will
make
you
a
nice
little
wife
as
i
walk
through
the
streets
leaning
on
your
did
you
ever
go
to
church
when
you
were
a
little
girl
he
asked
her
in
an
undertone
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
he
were
continuing
aloud
the
reverie
which
prevented
him
from
hearing
her
i
could
never
pass
a
church
without
entering
it
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
silently
behind
me
i
felt
as
though
i
were
in
paradise
itself
with
the
angels
whispering
stories
of
love
in
my
ears
and
the
saints
caressing
me
with
their
breath
ah
i
would
have
liked
to
live
there
for
ever
in
that
absorbing
she
looked
at
him
with
steady
eyes
a
passing
blaze
kindling
in
her
loving
glance
nevertheless
submissive
still
she
answered
i
will
do
as
you
may
fancy
i
learned
music
once
i
was
quite
a
clever
young
lady
and
was
taught
all
the
accomplishments
i
will
go
back
to
school
and
start
music
again
if
there
is
any
tune
you
would
like
to
hear
me
play
you
will
only
have
to
tell
me
and
i
will
practise
it
for
months
and
months
so
as
to
play
it
to
you
some
evening
in
our
own
home
when
we
are
by
ourselves
in
some
snug
little
room
with
the
curtains
closely
drawn
and
you
will
pay
me
with
just
one
kiss
won
t
you
a
kiss
right
on
the
lips
which
will
awaken
all
your
love
again
yes
yes
he
murmured
answering
his
own
thoughts
only
my
great
pleasure
at
first
was
to
light
the
candles
prepare
the
cruets
and
carry
the
missal
then
afterwards
i
was
filled
with
bliss
at
the
approach
of
god
and
felt
as
though
i
could
die
of
sheer
love
those
are
my
only
recollections
i
know
of
nothing
else
when
i
raise
my
hand
it
is
to
give
a
benediction
when
my
lips
protrude
it
is
to
kiss
the
altar
if
i
look
for
my
heart
i
can
no
longer
find
it
i
have
offered
it
to
god
and
he
has
taken
albine
grew
very
pale
and
her
eyes
gleamed
like
fire
in
a
quivering
voice
she
resumed
i
should
not
like
my
little
girl
to
leave
me
you
can
send
the
boy
to
college
if
you
wish
but
the
little
girl
must
always
keep
with
me
i
myself
will
teach
her
to
read
oh
i
shall
remember
everything
and
if
indeed
there
be
anything
that
i
find
i
have
forgotten
i
will
have
masters
to
teach
me
yes
we
will
keep
our
dear
little
ones
always
about
our
knees
you
will
be
happy
so
won
t
you
speak
to
me
tell
me
that
you
will
then
feel
warm
again
and
will
smile
and
feel
no
regrets
for
anything
you
have
left
but
serge
continued
i
have
often
thought
of
the
that
have
been
censed
in
their
niches
for
centuries
past
they
must
have
become
quite
saturated
with
incense
and
i
am
like
one
of
them
i
have
the
fragrance
of
incense
in
the
inmost
parts
of
my
being
it
is
that
embalmment
that
gives
me
serenity
deathlike
tranquillity
of
body
and
the
peace
which
i
enjoy
in
no
longer
living
ah
may
nothing
ever
disturb
my
quiescence
may
i
ever
remain
cold
and
rigid
with
a
ceaseless
smile
on
my
granite
lips
incapable
of
descending
among
men
that
is
my
one
my
only
desire
at
this
albine
sprang
to
her
feet
exasperated
threatening
she
shook
serge
and
cried
what
are
you
saying
what
is
it
you
are
dreaming
aloud
am
i
not
your
wife
haven
t
you
come
here
to
be
my
husband
he
recoiled
trembling
yet
more
violently
no
leave
me
i
am
afraid
he
faltered
but
our
life
together
our
happiness
the
children
we
shall
have
no
no
i
am
and
he
broke
out
into
a
supreme
cry
i
can
not
i
can
not
for
a
moment
albine
remained
silent
gazing
at
the
unhappy
man
who
lay
shivering
at
her
feet
her
face
flared
she
opened
her
arms
as
if
to
seize
him
and
strain
him
to
her
breast
with
wild
angry
passion
but
another
idea
came
to
her
and
she
merely
took
him
by
the
hand
and
raised
him
to
his
feet
come
said
she
she
led
him
away
to
that
giant
tree
to
the
very
spot
where
their
love
had
reigned
supreme
there
was
the
same
shade
there
was
the
same
trunk
as
of
yore
the
same
branches
spreading
far
around
like
sheltering
and
protecting
arms
the
tree
still
towered
aloft
kindly
robust
powerful
and
fertile
as
on
the
day
of
their
nuptials
languorous
warmth
the
glimmer
of
a
summer
s
night
fading
on
the
bare
shoulder
of
some
fair
girl
a
sob
of
love
dying
away
into
passionate
silence
lingered
about
the
clearing
as
it
lay
there
bathed
in
dim
green
light
and
in
the
distance
the
paradou
in
spite
of
the
first
chills
of
autumn
sighed
once
more
with
passion
again
becoming
love
s
accomplice
from
the
parterre
from
the
orchard
from
the
from
the
forest
from
the
great
rocks
from
the
spreading
heavens
came
back
a
ripple
of
voluptuous
joy
never
had
the
garden
even
on
the
warmest
evenings
of
shown
such
deep
tenderness
as
now
on
this
fair
autumn
evening
when
the
plants
and
trees
seemed
to
be
bidding
one
another
goodnight
ere
they
sank
to
sleep
and
the
scent
of
ripened
germs
wafted
the
intoxication
of
desire
athwart
the
scanty
leaves
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
faltered
albine
in
serge
s
ear
when
she
had
let
him
slip
upon
the
grass
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
serge
was
weeping
you
see
that
the
paradou
is
not
dead
she
added
it
is
crying
out
to
us
to
love
each
other
it
still
desires
our
union
oh
do
remember
clasp
me
to
your
heart
serge
still
wept
albine
said
nothing
more
she
flung
her
arms
around
him
she
pressed
her
warm
lips
to
his
face
but
tears
were
still
his
only
answer
then
after
a
long
silence
albine
spoke
she
stood
erect
full
of
contempt
and
determination
away
with
you
go
she
said
in
a
low
voice
serge
rose
with
difficulty
he
picked
up
his
breviary
which
had
fallen
upon
the
grass
and
he
walked
away
away
with
you
go
repeated
albine
in
louder
tones
as
she
followed
and
drove
him
before
her
thus
she
urged
him
on
from
bush
to
bush
till
she
had
driven
him
back
to
the
breach
in
the
wall
in
the
midst
of
the
trees
and
there
as
she
saw
serge
hesitate
with
lowered
head
she
cried
out
violently
away
with
you
go
and
slowly
she
herself
went
back
into
the
paradou
without
even
turning
her
head
night
was
fast
falling
and
the
garden
was
but
a
huge
bier
of
shadows
xiii
brother
archangias
aroused
from
his
slumber
stood
erect
in
the
breach
striking
the
stones
with
his
stick
and
swearing
abominably
may
the
devil
break
their
legs
for
them
may
he
drag
them
to
hell
by
their
feet
with
their
noses
trailing
in
their
abomination
but
when
he
saw
albine
driving
away
the
priest
he
stopped
for
a
moment
in
surprise
then
he
struck
the
stones
yet
more
vigorously
and
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
you
hussy
a
pleasant
journey
to
you
go
back
to
your
mates
the
wolves
a
priest
is
no
fit
companion
for
such
as
then
looking
at
abbe
mouret
he
growled
i
knew
you
were
in
there
i
saw
that
the
stones
had
been
disturbed
listen
to
me
monsieur
le
cure
your
sin
has
made
me
your
superior
and
god
tells
you
through
my
mouth
that
hell
has
no
torments
severe
enough
for
a
priest
who
lets
himself
succumb
to
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
if
he
were
to
pardon
you
now
he
would
be
too
indulgent
it
would
be
contrary
to
his
own
they
slowly
walked
down
the
hill
towards
les
artaud
the
priest
had
not
opened
his
lips
but
gradually
he
raised
his
head
erect
he
was
no
longer
trembling
as
in
the
distance
he
caught
sight
of
the
solitaire
looming
blackly
against
the
purplish
sky
and
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
tiles
on
the
church
a
faint
smile
came
to
his
lips
while
to
his
calm
eyes
there
rose
an
expression
of
perfect
serenity
meantime
the
brother
was
every
now
and
then
giving
a
vicious
kick
at
the
stones
that
came
in
his
way
presently
he
turned
to
his
companion
is
it
all
over
this
time
he
asked
when
i
was
your
age
i
was
possessed
too
a
demon
was
ever
gnawing
at
me
but
after
a
time
he
grew
weary
of
it
and
took
himself
off
now
that
he
has
gone
i
live
quietly
enough
oh
i
knew
very
well
that
you
would
go
for
three
weeks
past
i
have
been
keeping
watch
upon
you
i
used
to
look
into
the
garden
through
the
breach
in
the
wall
i
should
have
liked
to
cut
the
trees
down
i
have
often
hurled
stones
at
them
it
was
delightful
to
break
the
branches
tell
me
now
is
it
so
very
nice
to
be
there
he
made
abbe
mouret
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
glared
at
him
with
a
terrible
expression
of
jealousy
the
thought
of
the
priest
s
life
in
the
paradou
tortured
him
but
the
abbe
kept
perfect
silence
so
archangias
set
off
again
jeering
as
he
went
then
in
a
louder
voice
he
said
you
see
when
a
priest
behaves
as
you
have
done
he
scandalises
every
other
priest
i
myself
felt
sullied
by
your
conduct
however
you
are
now
behaving
more
sensibly
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
make
any
confession
i
know
what
has
happened
well
enough
heaven
has
broken
your
back
for
you
as
it
has
done
for
so
many
others
so
much
the
better
so
much
the
better
he
clapped
his
hands
triumphantly
but
abbe
mouret
immersed
in
deep
reverie
with
a
smile
spreading
over
his
whole
face
did
not
even
hear
him
when
the
brother
quitted
him
at
the
parsonage
door
he
went
round
and
entered
the
church
it
was
grey
and
gloomy
as
on
that
terrible
rainy
evening
when
temptation
had
racked
him
so
violently
and
it
still
remained
and
meditative
bare
of
all
that
gleaming
gold
and
sighing
passion
that
had
seemed
to
him
to
sweep
in
from
the
countryside
it
preserved
solemn
silence
but
a
breath
of
mercy
seemed
to
fill
it
kneeling
before
the
great
christ
and
bursting
into
tears
which
he
let
flow
down
his
cheeks
as
though
they
were
so
many
blessings
the
priest
murmured
o
god
it
is
not
true
that
thou
art
pitiless
i
know
it
i
feel
it
thou
hast
already
pardoned
me
i
feel
it
in
the
outpouring
of
thy
grace
which
for
hours
now
has
been
flowing
through
me
in
a
sweet
stream
bringing
me
back
slowly
but
surely
perfect
peace
and
spiritual
health
o
god
it
was
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
about
to
forsake
thee
that
thou
didst
protect
me
most
effectually
thou
didst
hide
thyself
from
me
the
better
to
rescue
me
from
evil
thou
didst
allow
my
flesh
to
run
its
course
that
i
might
be
convinced
of
its
nothingness
and
now
o
god
i
see
that
thou
hast
for
ever
marked
me
with
thy
seal
that
awful
seal
pregnant
with
blessings
which
sets
a
man
apart
from
other
men
and
whose
mark
is
so
ineffaceable
that
sooner
or
later
it
makes
itself
manifest
even
upon
those
who
sin
thou
hast
broken
me
with
sin
and
temptation
thou
hast
ravaged
me
with
thy
flames
thou
hast
willed
that
there
should
be
nought
left
of
me
save
ruins
wherein
thou
mightest
safely
descend
i
am
an
empty
tabernacle
wherein
thou
may
st
dwell
blessed
art
thou
o
god
he
prostrated
himself
and
continued
stammering
in
the
dust
the
church
triumphed
it
remained
firm
and
unshaken
over
the
priest
s
head
with
its
altars
and
its
confessional
its
pulpit
its
crosses
and
its
holy
images
the
world
had
ceased
to
exist
temptation
was
extinguished
like
a
fire
that
was
henceforth
unnecessary
for
the
abbe
s
purification
he
was
entering
into
supernatural
peace
and
he
raised
this
supreme
cry
to
the
exclusion
of
life
and
its
creatures
and
of
everything
that
be
in
it
i
belong
to
thee
o
god
to
thee
thee
alone
through
all
eternity
xiv
at
that
moment
albine
was
still
wandering
about
the
paradou
with
all
the
mute
agony
of
a
wounded
animal
she
had
ceased
to
weep
her
face
was
very
white
and
a
deep
crease
showed
upon
her
brow
why
did
she
have
to
suffer
that
deathlike
agony
of
what
fault
had
she
been
guilty
that
the
garden
no
longer
kept
the
promises
it
had
held
out
to
her
since
her
childhood
s
days
she
questioned
herself
as
she
walked
along
never
heeding
the
avenues
through
which
the
gloom
was
slowly
stealing
she
had
always
obeyed
the
voices
of
the
trees
she
could
not
remember
having
injured
a
single
flower
she
had
ever
been
the
beloved
daughter
of
the
greenery
hearkening
to
it
submissively
yielding
to
it
with
full
belief
in
the
happiness
which
it
promised
to
her
and
when
on
that
supreme
day
the
paradou
had
cried
to
her
to
cast
herself
beneath
the
she
had
done
so
in
compliance
with
its
voice
if
she
then
had
nothing
to
reproach
herself
with
it
must
be
the
garden
which
had
betrayed
her
the
garden
which
was
torturing
her
for
the
mere
sake
of
seeing
her
suffer
she
halted
and
looked
around
her
the
great
gloomy
masses
of
foliage
preserved
deep
silence
the
paths
were
blocked
with
black
walls
of
darkness
the
distant
lawns
were
lulling
to
sleep
the
breezes
that
kissed
them
and
she
thrust
out
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
hopelessness
and
raised
a
cry
of
protest
it
could
not
all
end
thus
but
her
voice
choked
beneath
the
silent
trees
thrice
did
she
implore
the
paradou
to
answer
her
but
never
an
explanation
fell
from
its
lofty
branches
not
a
leaf
seemed
to
be
moved
with
pity
for
her
then
she
resumed
her
weary
wandering
and
felt
that
she
was
entering
into
the
fatal
sternness
of
winter
now
that
she
had
ceased
to
rebelliously
question
the
earth
she
caught
sound
of
a
gentle
murmur
speeding
along
the
ground
it
was
the
farewell
of
the
plants
wishing
one
another
a
happy
death
to
have
drunk
in
the
sunshine
for
a
whole
season
to
have
lived
ever
blossoming
to
have
breathed
continual
perfume
and
then
at
the
first
blast
to
depart
with
the
hope
of
springing
up
again
elsewhere
was
not
that
sufficiently
long
and
full
a
life
which
obstinate
craving
for
further
existence
would
mar
ah
how
sweet
death
must
be
how
sweet
to
have
an
endless
night
before
one
wherein
to
dream
of
the
short
days
of
life
and
to
recall
eternally
its
fugitive
joys
she
stayed
her
steps
once
more
but
she
no
longer
protested
as
she
stood
there
amidst
the
deep
stillness
of
the
paradou
she
now
believed
that
she
understood
everything
the
garden
doubtless
had
death
in
store
for
her
as
a
supreme
culminating
happiness
it
was
to
death
that
it
had
all
along
been
leading
her
in
its
tender
fashion
after
love
there
could
be
nought
but
death
and
never
had
the
garden
loved
her
so
much
as
it
did
now
she
had
shown
herself
ungrateful
in
accusing
it
for
all
the
time
she
had
remained
its
best
beloved
child
the
motionless
boughs
the
paths
blocked
up
with
darkness
the
lawns
where
the
breezes
fell
asleep
had
only
become
mute
in
order
that
they
might
lure
her
on
to
taste
the
joys
of
long
silence
they
wished
her
to
be
with
them
in
their
winter
rest
they
dreamt
of
carrying
her
off
swathed
in
their
dry
leaves
with
her
eyes
frozen
like
the
waters
of
the
springs
her
limbs
stiffened
like
the
bare
branches
and
her
blood
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
sap
and
yes
she
would
live
their
life
to
the
very
end
and
die
their
death
perhaps
they
had
already
willed
that
she
should
spring
up
next
summer
as
a
rose
in
the
or
a
pale
willow
in
the
or
a
tender
birch
in
the
forest
yes
it
was
the
great
law
of
life
she
was
about
to
die
then
for
the
last
time
she
resumed
her
walk
through
the
paradou
in
quest
of
death
what
fragrant
plant
might
need
her
tresses
to
increase
the
perfume
of
its
leaves
what
flower
might
wish
the
gift
of
her
satinlike
skin
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
arms
the
tender
pink
of
her
bosom
to
what
weakly
tree
should
she
offer
her
young
blood
she
would
have
liked
to
be
of
service
to
the
weeds
vegetating
beside
the
paths
to
slay
herself
there
so
that
from
her
flesh
some
huge
greenery
might
spring
lofty
and
sapful
laden
with
birds
at
and
passionately
caressed
by
the
sun
but
for
a
long
while
the
paradou
still
maintained
silence
as
if
it
had
not
yet
made
up
its
mind
to
confide
to
her
in
what
last
kiss
it
would
spirit
away
her
life
she
had
to
wander
all
over
it
again
seeking
for
her
favourite
spots
night
was
now
more
swiftly
approaching
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
she
were
being
gradually
sucked
into
the
earth
she
climbed
to
the
great
rocks
and
questioned
them
asking
whether
it
was
upon
their
stony
beds
that
she
must
breathe
her
last
breath
she
crossed
the
forest
with
lingering
steps
hoping
that
some
oak
would
topple
down
and
bury
her
beneath
the
majesty
of
its
fall
she
skirted
the
streams
that
flowed
through
the
meadows
bending
down
at
almost
every
step
she
took
so
as
to
peep
into
the
depths
and
see
whether
a
couch
had
not
been
prepared
for
her
amongst
the
water
lilies
but
nowhere
did
death
call
her
nowhere
did
he
offer
her
his
cold
hands
yet
she
was
not
mistaken
it
was
indeed
the
paradou
that
was
about
to
teach
her
to
die
as
indeed
it
had
taught
her
to
love
she
again
began
to
scour
the
bushes
more
eagerly
even
than
on
those
warm
mornings
of
the
past
when
she
had
gone
searching
for
love
and
suddenly
just
as
she
was
reaching
the
parterre
she
came
upon
death
amidst
all
the
evening
fragrance
she
ran
forward
breaking
out
into
a
rapturous
laugh
she
was
to
die
amongst
the
flowers
first
she
hastened
to
the
rosary
there
in
the
last
flickering
of
the
gloaming
she
searched
the
beds
and
gathered
all
the
roses
that
hung
languishing
at
the
approach
of
winter
she
plucked
them
from
down
below
quite
heedless
of
their
thorns
she
plucked
them
in
front
of
her
with
both
hands
she
plucked
them
from
above
rising
upon
and
pulling
down
the
boughs
so
eager
was
she
so
desperate
was
her
haste
that
she
even
broke
the
branches
she
who
had
ever
shown
herself
tender
to
the
tiniest
blades
of
grass
soon
her
arms
were
full
of
roses
she
tottered
beneath
her
burden
of
flowers
and
having
quite
stripped
the
rose
trees
carrying
away
even
the
fallen
petals
she
turned
her
steps
to
the
pavilion
and
when
she
had
let
her
load
of
blossoms
slip
upon
the
floor
of
the
room
with
the
blue
ceiling
she
again
went
down
to
the
garden
this
time
she
sought
the
violets
she
made
huge
bunches
of
them
which
she
pressed
one
by
one
against
her
breast
then
she
sought
the
carnations
plucking
them
all
even
to
the
buds
massing
them
together
in
big
sheaves
of
white
blossoms
that
suggested
bowls
of
milk
and
big
sheaves
of
the
red
ones
that
seemed
like
bowls
of
blood
then
too
she
sought
the
stocks
the
patches
of
mirabilis
the
heliotropes
and
the
lilies
she
tore
the
last
blossoming
stocks
off
by
the
handful
pitilessly
crumpling
their
satin
ruches
she
devastated
the
beds
of
mirabilis
whose
flowers
were
scarcely
opening
to
the
evening
air
she
mowed
down
the
field
of
heliotropes
piling
her
harvest
of
blooms
into
a
heap
and
she
thrust
bundles
of
lilies
under
her
arms
like
handles
of
reeds
when
she
was
again
laden
with
as
much
as
she
could
carry
she
returned
to
the
pavilion
to
cast
the
violets
the
carnations
the
lilies
the
stocks
the
heliotrope
and
the
mirabilis
by
the
side
of
the
roses
and
then
without
stopping
to
draw
breath
she
went
down
yet
again
this
time
she
repaired
to
that
gloomy
corner
which
seemed
like
the
graveyard
of
the
a
warm
autumn
had
there
brought
on
a
second
crop
of
spring
flowers
she
raided
the
borders
of
tuberoses
and
hyacinths
going
down
upon
her
knees
and
gathering
her
harvest
with
all
a
miser
s
care
lest
she
should
miss
a
single
blossom
the
tuberoses
seemed
to
her
to
be
extremely
precious
flowers
which
would
distil
drops
of
gold
and
wealth
and
wondrous
sweetness
the
hyacinths
beaded
with
pearly
blooms
were
like
necklets
whose
every
pearl
would
pour
forth
joys
unknown
to
man
and
although
she
almost
buried
herself
beneath
the
mass
of
tuberoses
and
hyacinths
which
she
plucked
she
next
stripped
a
field
of
poppies
and
even
found
means
to
crop
an
expanse
of
marigolds
farther
on
all
these
she
heaped
over
the
tuberoses
and
hyacinths
and
then
ran
back
to
the
room
with
the
blue
ceiling
taking
the
greatest
care
as
she
went
that
the
breeze
should
not
rob
her
of
a
single
pistil
and
once
more
did
she
come
downstairs
but
what
was
she
to
gather
now
she
had
stripped
the
parterre
bare
as
she
rose
upon
the
tips
of
her
shoes
in
the
dim
gloom
she
could
only
see
the
garden
lying
there
naked
and
dead
deprived
of
the
tender
eyes
of
its
roses
the
crimson
smile
of
its
carnations
and
the
perfumed
locks
of
its
heliotropes
nevertheless
she
could
not
return
with
empty
arms
so
she
laid
hands
upon
the
herbs
and
leafy
plants
she
crawled
over
the
ground
as
though
she
would
have
carried
off
the
very
soil
itself
in
a
clutch
of
supreme
passion
she
filled
her
skirt
with
a
harvest
of
aromatic
plants
southernwood
mint
verbenas
she
came
across
a
border
of
balm
and
left
not
a
leaf
of
it
unplucked
she
even
broke
off
two
big
fennels
which
she
threw
over
her
shoulders
like
a
couple
of
trees
had
she
been
able
she
would
have
carried
all
the
greenery
of
the
garden
away
with
her
between
her
teeth
when
she
reached
the
threshold
of
the
pavilion
she
turned
round
and
gave
a
last
look
at
the
paradou
it
was
quite
dark
now
the
night
had
fully
come
and
cast
a
black
veil
over
everything
then
for
the
last
time
she
went
up
the
stairs
never
more
to
step
down
them
the
spacious
room
was
quickly
decked
she
had
placed
a
lighted
lamp
upon
the
table
she
sorted
out
the
flowers
heaped
upon
the
floor
and
arranged
them
in
big
bunches
which
she
distributed
about
the
room
first
she
placed
some
lilies
behind
the
lamp
on
the
table
forming
with
them
a
lofty
lacelike
screen
which
softened
the
light
with
its
snowy
purity
then
she
threw
handfuls
of
carnations
and
stocks
over
the
old
sofa
which
was
already
strewn
with
red
bouquets
that
had
faded
a
century
ago
till
all
these
were
hidden
and
the
sofa
looked
like
a
huge
bed
of
stocks
bristling
with
carnations
next
she
placed
the
four
armchairs
in
front
of
the
alcove
on
the
first
one
she
piled
marigolds
on
the
second
poppies
on
the
third
mirabilis
and
on
the
fourth
heliotrope
the
chairs
were
completely
buried
in
bloom
with
nothing
but
the
tips
of
their
arms
visible
at
last
she
thought
of
the
bed
she
pushed
a
little
table
near
the
head
of
it
and
reared
thereon
a
huge
pile
of
violets
then
she
covered
the
whole
bed
with
the
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
she
had
plucked
they
were
so
abundant
that
they
formed
a
thick
couch
overflowing
all
around
so
that
the
bed
now
looked
like
one
colossal
bloom
the
roses
still
remained
and
these
she
scattered
chancewise
all
over
the
room
without
even
looking
to
see
where
they
fell
some
of
them
dropped
upon
the
table
the
sofa
and
the
chairs
and
a
corner
of
the
bed
was
inundated
with
them
for
some
minutes
there
was
a
rain
of
roses
a
real
downpour
of
heavy
blossoms
which
settled
in
flowery
pools
in
the
hollows
of
the
floor
but
as
the
heap
seemed
scarcely
diminished
she
finished
by
weaving
garlands
of
roses
which
she
hung
upon
the
walls
she
twined
wreaths
around
the
necks
and
arms
and
waists
of
the
plaster
cupids
that
sported
over
the
alcove
the
blue
ceiling
the
oval
panels
edged
with
ribbon
the
voluptuous
paintings
preyed
upon
by
time
were
all
hung
with
a
mantle
a
drapery
of
roses
the
big
room
was
fully
decked
at
last
now
she
could
die
there
for
a
moment
she
remained
standing
glancing
around
her
she
was
looking
to
see
if
death
was
there
and
she
gathered
up
the
aromatic
greenery
the
southernwood
the
mint
the
verbenas
the
balm
and
the
fennel
she
broke
them
and
twisted
them
and
made
wedges
of
them
with
which
to
stop
up
every
little
chink
and
cranny
about
the
windows
and
the
door
then
she
drew
the
white
coarsely
sewn
calico
curtains
and
without
even
a
sigh
laid
herself
upon
the
bed
on
all
the
florescence
of
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
and
then
a
final
rapture
was
granted
her
with
her
eyes
wide
open
she
smiled
at
the
room
ah
how
she
had
loved
there
and
how
happily
she
was
there
going
to
die
at
that
supreme
moment
the
plaster
cupids
suggested
nothing
impure
to
her
the
amorous
paintings
disturbed
her
no
more
she
was
conscious
of
nothing
beneath
that
blue
ceiling
save
the
intoxicating
perfume
of
the
flowers
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
this
perfume
was
none
other
than
the
old
which
had
always
warmed
the
room
now
increased
a
hundredfold
till
it
had
become
so
strong
and
penetrating
that
it
would
surely
suffocate
her
perchance
it
was
the
breath
of
the
lady
who
had
died
there
a
century
ago
in
perfect
stillness
with
her
hands
clasped
over
her
heart
she
continued
smiling
while
she
listened
to
the
whispers
of
the
perfumes
in
her
buzzing
head
they
were
singing
to
her
a
soft
strange
melody
of
fragrance
which
slowly
and
very
gently
lulled
her
to
sleep
at
first
there
was
a
prelude
bright
and
childlike
her
hands
that
had
just
now
twisted
and
twined
the
aromatic
greenery
exhaled
the
pungency
of
crushed
herbage
and
recalled
her
old
girlish
ramblings
through
the
wildness
of
the
paradou
then
there
came
a
flutelike
song
a
song
of
short
musky
notes
rising
from
the
violets
that
lay
upon
the
table
near
the
head
of
the
bed
and
this
flutelike
strain
trilling
melodiously
to
the
soft
accompaniment
of
the
lilies
on
the
other
table
sang
to
her
of
the
first
joys
of
love
its
first
confession
and
first
kiss
beneath
the
trees
of
the
forest
but
she
began
to
stifle
as
passion
drew
nigh
with
the
breath
of
the
carnations
which
burst
upon
her
in
brazen
notes
that
seemed
to
drown
all
others
she
thought
that
death
was
nigh
when
the
poppies
and
the
marigolds
broke
into
a
wailing
strain
which
recalled
the
torment
of
desire
but
suddenly
all
grew
quieter
she
felt
that
she
could
breathe
more
freely
she
glided
into
greater
serenity
lulled
by
a
descending
scale
that
came
from
the
throats
of
the
stocks
and
died
away
amidst
a
delightful
hymn
from
the
heliotropes
which
with
their
breath
proclaimed
the
approach
of
nuptial
bliss
here
and
there
the
mirabilis
gently
trilled
then
came
a
hush
and
afterwards
the
roses
languidly
made
their
entry
their
voices
streamed
from
the
ceiling
like
the
strains
of
a
distant
choir
it
was
a
chorus
of
great
breadth
to
which
she
at
first
listened
with
a
slight
quiver
then
the
volume
of
the
strain
increased
and
soon
her
whole
frame
vibrated
with
the
mighty
sounds
that
burst
in
waves
around
her
the
nuptials
were
at
hand
the
trumpet
blasts
of
the
roses
announced
them
she
pressed
her
hands
more
closely
to
her
heart
as
she
lay
there
panting
gasping
dying
when
she
opened
her
lips
for
the
kiss
which
was
to
stifle
her
the
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
shot
out
their
perfume
and
enveloped
her
with
so
deep
so
great
a
sigh
that
the
chorus
of
the
roses
could
be
heard
no
more
and
then
amidst
the
final
gasp
of
the
flowers
albine
died
xv
about
three
o
clock
the
next
afternoon
la
teuse
and
brother
archangias
who
were
chatting
on
the
saw
doctor
pascal
s
gig
come
at
full
gallop
through
the
village
the
whip
was
being
vigorously
brandished
from
beneath
the
lowered
hood
where
can
he
be
off
to
at
that
rate
murmured
the
old
servant
he
will
break
his
the
gig
had
just
reached
the
rising
ground
on
which
the
church
was
built
suddenly
the
horse
reared
and
stopped
and
the
doctor
s
head
with
its
long
white
hair
all
dishevelled
appeared
from
under
the
hood
is
serge
there
he
cried
in
a
voice
full
of
indignant
excitement
la
teuse
had
stepped
to
the
edge
of
the
hill

room
she
said

breviary
do

want
to
speak
to
him

i
call

uncle
pascal
who
seemed
almost
distracted
made
an
angry
gesture
with
his
whip
hand
bending
still
further
forward
at
the
risk
of
falling
out
he
replied
ah

reading

breviary

no

strangle

from
me
that

and
he
drove
off
lashing
his
horse
so
fiercely
that
it
almost
bolted
but
twenty
paces
away
he
pulled
up
again
and
once
more
stretching
out
his
head
cried
loudly
tell
him
too
from
me
that
she
was
it
will
please
him
to
know
then
the
gig
rolled
on
wildly
again
jolting
dangerously
as
it
ascended
the
stony
hill
that
led
to
the
paradou
la
teuse
was
quite
dumbfounded
but
brother
archangias
sniggered
and
looked
at
her
with
savage
delight
glittering
in
his
eyes
she
noticed
this
at
last
and
thrust
him
away
from
her
almost
making
him
fall
down
the
steps
be
off
with
you
she
stammered
full
of
anger
seeking
to
relieve
her
feelings
by
abusing
him
i
shall
grow
to
hate
you
is
it
possible
to
rejoice
at
any
one
s
death
i
wasn
t
fond
of
the
girl
myself
but
it
is
very
sad
to
die
at
her
age
be
off
with
you
and
don
t
go
on
sniggering
like
that
or
i
will
throw
my
scissors
in
your
face
it
was
only
about
one
o
clock
that
a
peasant
who
had
gone
to
plassans
to
sell
vegetables
had
told
doctor
pascal
of
albine
s
death
and
had
added
that
jeanbernat
wished
to
see
him
the
doctor
now
was
feeling
a
little
relieved
by
what
he
had
just
shouted
as
he
passed
the
parsonage
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
expressly
to
give
himself
that
satisfaction
he
reproached
himself
for
the
death
of
the
girl
as
for
a
crime
in
which
he
had
participated
all
along
the
road
he
had
never
ceased
overwhelming
himself
with
insults
and
though
he
wiped
the
tears
from
his
eyes
that
he
might
see
where
to
guide
his
horse
he
ever
angrily
drove
his
gig
over
heaps
of
stones
as
if
hoping
that
he
would
overturn
himself
and
break
one
of
his
limbs
however
when
he
reached
the
long
lane
that
skirted
the
endless
wall
of
the
park
a
glimmer
of
hope
broke
upon
him
perhaps
albine
was
only
in
a
dead
faint
the
peasant
had
told
him
that
she
had
suffocated
herself
with
flowers
ah
if
he
could
only
get
there
in
time
if
he
could
only
save
her
and
he
lashed
his
horse
ferociously
as
though
he
were
lashing
himself
it
was
a
lovely
day
the
pavilion
was
all
bathed
in
sunlight
just
as
it
had
been
in
the
fair
but
the
leaves
of
the
ivy
which
mounted
to
the
roof
were
spotted
and
patched
with
rust
and
bees
no
longer
buzzed
round
the
tall
gilliflowers
doctor
pascal
hastily
tethered
his
horse
and
pushed
open
the
gate
of
the
little
garden
all
around
still
prevailed
that
perfect
silence
amidst
which
jeanbernat
had
been
wont
to
smoke
his
pipe
but
the
old
man
was
no
longer
seated
on
his
bench
watching
his
lettuces
jeanbernat
called
the
doctor
no
one
answered
then
on
entering
the
vestibule
he
saw
something
that
he
had
never
seen
before
at
the
end
of
the
passage
below
the
dark
staircase
was
a
door
opening
into
the
paradou
and
he
could
see
the
vast
garden
spreading
there
beneath
the
pale
sunlight
with
all
its
autumn
melancholy
its
sere
and
yellow
foliage
the
doctor
hurried
through
the
doorway
and
took
a
few
steps
over
the
damp
grass
ah
it
is
you
doctor
said
jeanbernat
in
a
calm
voice
the
old
man
was
digging
a
hole
at
the
foot
of
a
he
had
straightened
his
tall
figure
on
hearing
the
approach
of
footsteps
but
he
promptly
betook
himself
to
his
task
again
throwing
out
at
each
effort
a
huge
mass
of
rich
soil
what
are
you
doing
there
asked
doctor
pascal
jeanbernat
straightened
himself
again
and
wiped
the
sweat
off
his
face
with
the
sleeve
of
his
jacket
i
am
digging
a
hole
he
answered
simply
she
always
loved
the
garden
and
it
will
please
her
to
sleep
the
doctor
nearly
choked
with
emotion
for
a
moment
he
stood
by
the
edge
of
the
grave
incapable
of
speaking
but
watching
jeanbernat
as
the
other
sturdily
dug
on
where
is
she
he
asked
at
last
up
there
in
her
room
i
left
her
on
the
bed
i
should
like
you
to
go
and
listen
to
her
heart
before
she
is
put
away
in
here
i
listened
myself
but
i
couldn
t
hear
anything
at
the
doctor
went
upstairs
the
room
had
not
been
disturbed
only
a
window
had
been
opened
there
the
withered
flowers
stifled
by
their
own
perfumes
exhaled
but
the
faint
odour
of
dead
beauty
within
the
alcove
however
there
still
hung
an
asphyxiating
warmth
which
seemed
to
trickle
into
the
room
and
gradually
disperse
in
tiny
puffs
albine
with
her
hands
upon
her
heart
and
a
smile
playing
over
her
face
lay
sleeping
on
her
couch
of
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
and
she
was
quite
happy
since
she
was
quite
dead
standing
by
the
bedside
the
doctor
gazed
at
her
for
a
long
time
with
a
keen
expression
such
as
comes
into
the
eyes
of
scientists
who
attempt
to
work
resurrections
but
he
did
not
even
disturb
her
clasped
hands
he
kissed
her
brow
on
the
spot
where
her
latent
maternity
had
already
set
a
slight
shadow
below
in
the
garden
jeanbernat
was
still
driving
his
spade
into
the
ground
in
heavy
regular
fashion
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
however
the
old
man
came
upstairs
he
had
completed
his
work
he
found
the
doctor
seated
by
the
bedside
buried
in
such
a
deep
reverie
that
he
did
not
seem
conscious
of
the
heavy
tears
that
were
trickling
down
his
cheeks
the
two
men
only
glanced
at
each
other
then
after
an
interval
of
silence
jeanbernat
slowly
said
well
was
i
not
right
there
is
nothing
nothing
nothing
it
is
all
mere
he
remained
standing
and
began
to
pick
up
the
roses
that
had
fallen
from
the
bed
throwing
them
one
by
one
upon
albine
s
skirts
the
flowers
he
said
live
only
for
a
day
while
the
rough
nettles
like
me
wear
out
the
very
stones
amidst
which
they
spring
now
it
s
all
over
i
can
kick
the
bucket
i
am
nearly
distracted
my
last
ray
of
sunlight
has
been
snuffed
out
it
s
all
nonsense
as
i
said
he
threw
himself
upon
one
of
the
chairs
in
his
turn
he
did
not
shed
a
tear
he
bore
himself
with
rigid
despair
like
some
automaton
whose
mechanism
is
broken
mechanically
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
a
book
that
lay
on
the
little
table
strewn
with
violets
it
was
one
of
the
books
stored
away
in
the
loft
an
odd
volume
of
holbach
which
he
had
been
reading
since
the
morning
while
watching
by
albine
s
body
as
the
doctor
still
remained
silent
buried
in
distressful
thought
he
began
to
turn
its
pages
over
but
a
sadden
idea
occurred
to
him
doubtless
holbach
s
now
forgotten
of
into
which
zola
himself
may
well
have
peeped
whilst
writing
this
ed
if
you
will
help
me
he
said
to
the
doctor
we
will
carry
her
downstairs
and
bury
her
with
all
her
uncle
pascal
shuddered
then
he
explained
to
the
old
man
that
it
was
not
allowed
for
one
to
keep
the
dead
in
that
fashion
what
it
isn
t
allowed
cried
jeanbernat
well
then
i
will
allow
it
myself
doesn
t
she
belong
to
me
isn
t
she
mine
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
let
the
priests
walk
off
with
her
let
them
try
if
they
want
to
get
a
shot
from
my
gun
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
waved
his
book
about
with
a
terrible
gesture
but
the
doctor
caught
hold
of
his
hands
and
clasped
them
within
his
own
beseeching
him
to
be
calm
and
for
a
long
time
he
talked
to
him
saying
all
that
he
had
upon
his
mind
he
blamed
himself
made
fragmentary
confessions
of
his
fault
and
vaguely
hinted
at
those
who
had
killed
albine
listen
he
said
in
conclusion
she
is
yours
no
longer
you
must
give
her
but
jeanbernat
shook
his
head
and
again
waved
his
hand
in
token
of
refusal
however
his
obstinate
resolution
was
shaken
and
at
last
he
said
well
well
let
them
take
her
and
may
she
break
their
arms
for
them
i
only
wish
that
she
could
rise
up
out
of
the
ground
and
kill
them
all
with
fright
by
the
way
i
have
a
little
business
to
settle
over
there
i
will
go
then
doctor
the
hole
will
do
for
and
when
the
doctor
had
left
he
again
sat
down
by
the
dead
girl
s
side
and
gravely
resumed
the
perusal
of
his
book
xvi
that
morning
there
was
great
commotion
in
the
yard
at
the
parsonage
the
artaud
butcher
had
just
slaughtered
matthew
the
pig
in
the
shed
desiree
quite
enthusiastic
about
it
all
had
held
matthew
s
feet
while
he
was
being
bled
kissing
him
on
the
back
that
he
might
feel
the
pain
of
the
knife
less
and
telling
him
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
be
killed
now
that
he
had
got
so
fat
no
one
could
cut
off
a
goose
s
neck
with
a
single
stroke
of
the
hatchet
more
unconcernedly
than
she
could
or
gash
open
a
fowl
s
throat
with
a
pair
of
scissors
however
much
she
loved
her
charges
she
looked
upon
their
slaughter
with
great
equanimity
it
was
quite
necessary
she
would
say
it
made
room
for
the
young
ones
who
were
growing
up
and
that
morning
she
was
very
gay
mademoiselle
grumbled
la
teuse
every
minute
you
will
end
by
making
yourself
ill
there
is
no
sense
in
working
yourself
up
into
such
a
state
just
because
a
pig
has
been
slaughtered
you
are
as
red
as
if
you
had
been
dancing
a
whole
but
desiree
only
clapped
her
hands
and
turned
away
and
bustled
about
again
la
teuse
for
her
part
complained
that
her
legs
were
sinking
under
her
since
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
her
big
carcass
had
been
perpetually
rolling
between
the
kitchen
and
the
yard
for
she
had
black
puddings
to
make
it
was
she
who
had
whisked
the
blood
in
two
large
earthenware
pans
and
she
had
thought
that
she
would
never
get
finished
since
mademoiselle
was
for
ever
calling
her
away
for
mere
nothings
it
must
be
admitted
that
at
the
very
moment
when
the
butcher
was
bleeding
matthew
desiree
had
been
thrilled
with
wild
excitement
for
lisa
the
cow
was
about
to
calve
and
the
girl
s
delight
at
this
had
quite
turned
her
head
one
goes
and
another
comes
she
cried
skipping
and
twirling
round
come
here
la
teuse
come
here
it
was
eleven
o
clock
every
now
and
then
the
sound
of
chanting
was
wafted
from
the
church
a
confused
murmur
of
doleful
voices
a
muttering
of
prayers
could
be
heard
amidst
scraps
of
latin
pronounced
in
louder
and
clearer
tones
come
oh
do
come
repeated
desiree
for
the
twentieth
time
i
must
go
and
toll
the
bell
now
muttered
the
old
servant
i
shall
never
get
finished
really
what
is
it
that
you
want
now
mademoiselle
but
she
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
she
threw
herself
upon
a
swarm
of
fowls
who
were
greedily
drinking
the
blood
from
the
pans
and
having
angrily
kicked
them
away
and
then
covered
up
the
pans
she
called
to
desiree
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
instead
of
tormenting
me
you
only
came
to
look
after
these
wretched
birds
if
you
let
them
do
as
they
like
there
will
be
no
for
you
do
you
hear
desiree
only
laughed
what
of
it
if
the
fowls
did
drink
a
few
drops
of
the
blood
it
would
fatten
them
then
she
again
tried
to
drag
la
teuse
off
to
the
cow
but
the
old
servant
refused
to
go
i
must
go
and
toll
the
bell
the
procession
will
be
coming
out
of
church
directly
you
know
that
quite
at
this
moment
the
voices
in
the
church
rose
yet
more
loudly
and
a
sound
of
steps
could
be
distinctly
heard
no
no
insisted
desiree
dragging
la
teuse
towards
the
stable
just
come
and
look
at
her
and
tell
me
what
ought
to
be
la
teuse
shrugged
her
shoulders
all
that
the
cow
wanted
was
to
be
left
alone
and
not
bothered
then
she
set
off
towards
the
vestry
but
as
she
passed
the
shed
she
raised
a
fresh
cry
there
there
she
shrieked
shaking
her
fist
ah
the
little
wretch
matthew
was
lying
at
full
length
on
his
back
with
his
feet
in
the
air
under
the
shed
waiting
to
be
singed
the
gash
which
the
knife
had
made
in
his
neck
was
still
quite
fresh
and
was
beaded
with
drops
of
blood
and
a
little
white
hen
was
very
delicately
picking
off
these
drops
of
blood
one
by
one
in
some
parts
of
france
pigs
when
killed
are
singed
not
scalded
as
is
i
think
the
usual
practice
in
ed
why
of
course
quietly
remarked
desiree
she
s
regaling
and
the
girl
stooped
and
patted
the
pig
s
plump
belly
saying
eh
my
fat
fellow
you
have
stolen
their
food
too
often
to
grudge
them
a
wee
bit
of
your
neck
now
la
teuse
hastily
doffed
her
apron
and
threw
it
round
matthew
s
neck
then
she
hurried
away
and
disappeared
within
the
church
the
great
door
had
just
creaked
on
its
rusty
hinges
and
a
burst
of
chanting
rose
in
the
open
air
amidst
the
quiet
sunshine
suddenly
the
bell
began
to
toll
with
slow
and
regular
strokes
desiree
who
had
remained
kneeling
beside
the
pig
patting
his
belly
raised
her
head
to
listen
while
still
continuing
to
smile
when
she
saw
that
she
was
alone
having
glanced
cautiously
around
she
glided
away
into
the
cow
s
stable
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
the
little
iron
gate
of
the
graveyard
which
had
been
opened
quite
wide
to
let
the
body
pass
hung
against
the
wall
half
torn
from
its
hinges
the
sunshine
slept
upon
the
herbage
of
the
empty
expanse
into
which
the
funeral
procession
passed
chanting
the
last
verse
of
the
then
silence
fell
æternam
dona
ei
resumed
abbe
mouret
in
solemn
tones
lux
perpetua
luceat
brother
archangias
bellowed
at
the
head
walked
vincent
wearing
a
surplice
and
bearing
the
cross
a
large
copper
cross
half
the
silver
plating
of
which
had
come
off
he
lifted
it
aloft
with
both
his
hands
then
followed
abbe
mouret
looking
very
pale
in
his
black
chasuble
but
with
his
head
erect
and
without
a
quiver
on
his
lips
as
he
chanted
the
office
gazing
into
the
distance
with
fixed
eyes
the
flame
of
the
lighted
candle
which
he
was
carrying
scarcely
showed
in
the
daylight
and
behind
him
almost
touching
him
came
albine
s
coffin
borne
by
four
peasants
on
a
sort
of
litter
painted
black
the
coffin
was
clumsily
covered
with
too
short
a
pall
and
at
the
lower
end
of
it
the
fresh
deal
of
which
it
was
made
could
be
seen
with
the
heads
of
the
nails
sparkling
with
a
steely
glitter
upon
the
pall
lay
flowers
handfuls
of
white
roses
hyacinths
and
tuberoses
taken
from
the
dead
girl
s
very
bed
just
be
careful
cried
brother
archangias
to
the
peasants
as
they
slightly
tilted
the
litter
in
order
to
get
it
through
the
gateway
you
will
be
upsetting
everything
on
to
the
ground
he
kept
the
coffin
in
its
place
with
one
of
his
fat
hands
with
the
other
as
there
was
no
second
clerk
he
was
carrying
the
vessel
and
he
likewise
represented
the
choirman
the
rural
guard
who
had
been
unable
to
come
come
in
too
you
others
he
exclaimed
turning
round
there
was
a
second
funeral
that
of
rosalie
s
baby
who
had
died
the
previous
day
from
an
attack
of
convulsions
the
mother
the
father
old
mother
brichet
catherine
and
two
big
girls
la
rousse
and
lisa
were
there
the
two
last
were
carrying
the
baby
s
coffin
one
supporting
each
end
suddenly
all
voices
were
hushed
again
and
there
came
another
interval
whilst
the
bell
continued
tolling
in
slow
and
desolate
accents
the
funeral
procession
crossed
the
entire
going
towards
the
corner
which
was
formed
by
the
church
and
the
wall
of
desiree
s
swarms
of
grasshoppers
leaped
away
at
the
approaching
footsteps
and
lizards
hurried
into
their
holes
a
heavy
warmth
hung
over
this
corner
of
the
loamy
cemetery
the
crackling
of
the
dry
grass
beneath
the
tramp
of
the
mourners
sounded
like
choking
sobs
there
stop
where
you
are
cried
the
brother
barring
the
way
before
the
two
big
girls
who
were
carrying
the
baby
s
coffin
wait
for
your
turn
don
t
be
getting
in
our
legs
the
two
girls
laid
the
baby
on
the
ground
rosalie
fortune
and
old
mother
brichet
were
lingering
in
the
middle
of
the
graveyard
while
catherine
slyly
followed
brother
archangias
albine
s
grave
was
on
the
left
hand
of
abbe
caffin
s
tomb
whose
white
stone
seemed
in
the
sunshine
to
be
flecked
with
silvery
spangles
the
deep
cavity
freshly
dug
that
morning
yawned
amidst
thick
tufts
of
grass
big
weeds
almost
uprooted
drooped
over
the
edges
and
a
fallen
flower
lay
at
the
bottom
staining
the
dark
soil
with
its
crimson
petals
when
abbe
mouret
came
forward
the
soft
earth
crumbled
and
gave
way
beneath
his
feet
he
was
obliged
to
step
back
to
keep
himself
from
slipping
into
the
grave
he
began
in
a
full
voice
which
rose
above
the
mournful
tolling
of
the
bell
during
the
anthem
those
who
were
present
instinctively
cast
furtive
glances
towards
the
bottom
of
the
empty
grave
vincent
who
had
planted
the
cross
at
the
foot
of
the
cavity
opposite
the
priest
pushed
the
loose
earth
with
his
foot
and
amused
himself
by
watching
it
fall
this
drew
a
laugh
from
catherine
who
was
leaning
forward
from
behind
him
to
get
a
better
view
the
peasants
had
set
the
litter
on
the
grass
and
were
stretching
their
arms
while
brother
archangias
prepared
the
sprinkler
come
here
voriau
called
fortune
the
big
black
dog
who
had
gone
to
sniff
at
the
coffin
came
back
sulkily
why
has
the
dog
been
brought
exclaimed
rosalie
oh
he
followed
us
said
lisa
smiling
quietly
they
were
all
chatting
together
in
subdued
tones
round
the
baby
s
coffin
the
father
and
mother
occasionally
forgot
all
about
it
but
on
catching
sight
of
it
again
lying
between
them
at
their
feet
they
relapsed
into
silence
and
so
old
bambousse
wouldn
t
come
said
la
rousse
mother
brichet
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
he
threatened
to
break
everything
to
pieces
yesterday
when
the
little
one
died
said
she
no
no
i
must
say
that
he
is
not
a
good
man
didn
t
he
nearly
strangle
me
crying
out
that
he
had
been
robbed
and
that
he
would
have
given
one
of
his
cornfields
for
the
little
one
to
have
died
three
days
before
the
wedding
one
can
never
tell
what
will
happen
remarked
fortune
with
a
knowing
look
what
s
the
good
of
the
old
man
putting
himself
out
about
it
we
are
married
all
the
same
now
added
rosalie
then
they
exchanged
a
smile
across
the
little
coffin
while
lisa
and
la
rousse
nudged
each
other
with
their
elbows
but
afterwards
they
all
became
very
serious
again
fortune
picked
up
a
clod
of
earth
to
throw
at
voriau
who
was
now
prowling
about
amongst
the
old
tombstones
ah
they
ve
nearly
finished
over
there
now
la
rousse
whispered
very
softly
abbe
mouret
was
just
concluding
the
in
front
of
albine
s
grave
then
with
slow
steps
he
approached
the
coffin
drew
himself
up
erect
and
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
without
a
quiver
in
his
glance
he
looked
taller
his
face
shone
with
a
serenity
that
seemed
to
transfigure
him
he
stooped
and
picked
up
a
handful
of
earth
and
scattered
it
over
the
coffin
crosswise
then
in
a
voice
so
steady
and
clear
that
not
a
syllable
was
lost
he
said
in
terrain
suam
unde
erat
et
spiritus
redit
ad
deum
qui
dedit
a
shudder
ran
through
those
who
were
present
lisa
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
moment
and
then
remarked
with
an
expression
of
worry
it
is
not
very
cheerful
eh
when
one
thinks
that
one
s
own
turn
will
come
some
day
or
but
brother
archangias
had
now
handed
the
sprinkler
to
the
priest
who
took
it
and
shook
it
several
times
over
the
corpse
in
he
murmured
responded
vincent
and
the
brother
together
in
tones
so
respectively
shrill
and
deep
that
catherine
had
to
cram
her
fist
into
her
mouth
to
keep
from
laughing
no
indeed
it
is
certainly
not
cheerful
continued
lisa
there
really
was
nobody
at
all
at
that
funeral
the
graveyard
would
be
quite
empty
without
i
ve
heard
say
that
she
killed
herself
said
old
mother
brichet
yes
i
know
interrupted
la
rousse
the
brother
didn
t
want
to
let
her
be
buried
amongst
christians
but
monsieur
le
cure
said
that
eternity
was
for
everybody
i
was
there
but
all
the
same
the
philosopher
might
have
at
that
very
moment
rosalie
reduced
them
all
to
silence
by
murmuring
see
there
he
is
the
jeanbernat
was
indeed
just
entering
the
graveyard
he
walked
straight
to
the
group
that
stood
around
albine
s
grave
and
he
stepped
along
with
so
lithe
so
springy
a
gait
that
none
of
them
heard
him
coming
when
he
was
close
to
them
he
remained
for
a
moment
behind
brother
archangias
and
seemed
to
fix
his
eyes
for
an
instant
on
the
nape
of
the
brother
s
neck
then
just
as
the
abbe
mouret
was
finishing
the
office
he
calmly
drew
a
knife
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
with
a
single
cut
sliced
off
the
brother
s
right
ear
there
had
been
no
time
for
any
one
to
interfere
the
brother
gave
a
terrible
yell
the
left
one
will
be
for
another
occasion
said
jeanbernat
quietly
as
he
threw
the
ear
upon
the
ground
then
he
went
off
so
great
and
so
general
was
the
stupefaction
that
nobody
followed
him
brother
archangias
had
dropped
upon
the
heap
of
fresh
soil
which
had
been
thrown
out
of
the
grave
he
was
staunching
his
bleeding
wound
with
his
handkerchief
one
of
the
four
peasants
who
had
carried
the
coffin
wanted
to
lead
him
away
conduct
him
home
but
he
refused
with
a
gesture
and
remained
where
he
was
fierce
and
sullen
wishing
to
see
albine
lowered
into
the
pit
there
it
s
our
turn
at
last
said
rosalie
with
a
little
sigh
but
abbe
mouret
still
lingered
by
the
grave
watching
the
bearers
who
were
slipping
cords
under
albine
s
coffin
in
order
that
they
might
let
it
down
gently
the
bell
was
still
tolling
but
la
teuse
must
have
been
getting
tired
for
it
tolled
irregularly
as
though
it
were
becoming
a
little
irritated
at
the
length
of
the
ceremony
the
sun
was
growing
hotter
and
the
solitaire
s
shadow
crept
slowly
over
the
grass
and
the
grave
mounds
when
abbe
mouret
was
obliged
to
step
back
in
order
to
give
the
bearers
room
his
eyes
lighted
upon
the
marble
tombstone
of
abbe
caffin
that
priest
who
also
had
loved
and
who
was
now
sleeping
there
so
peacefully
beneath
the
then
all
at
once
even
as
the
coffin
descended
supported
by
the
cords
whose
knots
made
it
strain
and
creak
a
tremendous
uproar
arose
in
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
the
goat
began
to
bleat
the
ducks
the
geese
and
the
turkeys
raised
their
loudest
calls
and
flapped
their
wings
the
fowls
all
cackled
at
once
the
yellow
cock
alexander
crowed
forth
his
trumpet
notes
the
rabbits
could
even
be
heard
leaping
in
their
hutches
and
shaking
their
wooden
floors
and
above
all
this
lifeful
uproar
of
the
animal
creation
a
loud
laugh
rang
out
there
was
a
rustling
of
skirts
desiree
with
her
hair
streaming
her
arms
bare
to
the
elbows
and
her
face
crimson
with
triumph
burst
into
sight
her
hands
resting
upon
the
coping
of
the
wall
she
had
doubtless
climbed
upon
the
serge
serge
she
cried
at
that
moment
albine
s
coffin
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
grave
the
cords
had
just
been
withdrawn
one
of
the
peasants
was
throwing
the
first
shovelful
of
earth
into
the
cavity
serge
serge
desiree
cried
still
more
loudly
clapping
her
hands
the
cow
has
got
a
calf

end
