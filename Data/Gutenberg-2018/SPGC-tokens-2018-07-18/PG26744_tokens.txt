the
power
of
prayer
the
following
account
of
some
of
the
experiences
which
eventually
led
to
the
formation
of
the
china
inland
mission
and
to
its
taking
the
form
in
which
it
has
been
developed
first
appeared
in
the
pages
of
many
of
those
who
read
it
there
asked
that
it
might
appear
in
separate
form
miss
guinness
incorporated
it
in
the
of
the
china
inland
a
record
which
contained
the
account
of
god
goodness
to
the
beginning
of
but
friends
still
asking
for
it
in
pamphlet
form
for
wider
distribution
this
edition
is
brought
out
much
of
the
material
was
taken
from
notes
of
addresses
given
in
china
during
a
conference
of
our
missionaries
this
will
account
for
the
direct
and
narrative
form
of
the
papers
which
it
has
not
been
thought
necessary
to
change
it
is
always
helpful
to
us
to
fix
our
attention
on
the
aspect
of
christian
work
to
realise
that
the
work
of
god
does
not
mean
so
much
man
work
for
god
as
god
own
work
through
man
furthermore
in
our
privileged
position
of
with
him
while
fully
recognising
all
the
benefits
and
blessings
to
be
bestowed
on
a
world
through
the
proclamation
of
the
gospel
and
spread
of
the
truth
we
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
higher
aspect
of
our
work
that
of
obedience
to
god
of
bringing
glory
to
his
name
of
gladdening
the
heart
of
our
god
and
father
by
living
and
serving
as
his
beloved
children
many
circumstances
connected
with
my
own
early
life
and
service
presented
this
aspect
of
work
vividly
to
me
and
as
i
think
of
some
of
them
i
am
reminded
of
how
much
the
cause
of
missions
is
indebted
to
many
who
are
never
themselves
permitted
to
see
the
mission
field
many
it
may
be
who
are
unable
to
give
largely
of
their
substance
and
who
will
be
not
a
little
surprised
in
the
great
day
to
see
how
much
the
work
has
been
advanced
by
their
love
their
sympathy
and
their
prayers
for
myself
and
for
the
work
that
i
have
been
permitted
to
do
for
god
i
owe
an
unspeakable
debt
of
gratitude
to
my
beloved
and
honoured
parents
who
have
passed
away
and
entered
into
rest
but
the
influence
of
whose
lives
will
never
pass
away
many
years
ago
probably
about
the
heart
of
my
dear
father
then
himself
an
earnest
and
successful
evangelist
at
home
was
deeply
stirred
as
to
the
spiritual
state
of
china
by
reading
several
books
and
especially
an
account
of
the
travels
of
captain
basil
hall
his
circumstances
were
such
as
to
preclude
the
hope
of
his
ever
going
to
china
for
personal
service
but
he
was
led
to
pray
that
if
god
should
give
him
a
son
he
might
be
called
and
privileged
to
labour
in
the
vast
needy
empire
which
was
then
apparently
so
sealed
against
the
truth
i
was
not
aware
of
this
desire
or
prayer
myself
until
my
return
to
england
more
than
seven
years
after
i
had
sailed
for
china
but
it
was
very
interesting
then
to
know
how
prayer
offered
before
my
birth
had
been
answered
in
this
matter
all
thought
of
my
becoming
a
missionary
was
abandoned
for
many
years
by
my
dear
parents
on
account
of
the
feebleness
of
my
health
when
the
time
came
however
god
gave
increased
health
and
my
life
has
been
spared
and
strength
has
been
given
for
not
a
little
toilsome
service
both
in
the
mission
field
and
at
home
while
many
stronger
men
and
women
have
succumbed
i
had
many
opportunities
in
early
years
of
learning
the
value
of
prayer
and
of
the
word
of
god
for
it
was
the
delight
of
my
dear
parents
to
point
out
that
if
there
were
any
such
being
as
god
to
trust
him
to
obey
him
and
to
be
fully
given
up
to
his
service
must
of
necessity
be
the
best
and
wisest
course
both
for
myself
and
others
but
in
spite
of
these
helpful
examples
and
precepts
my
heart
was
unchanged
often
i
had
tried
to
make
myself
a
christian
and
failing
of
course
in
such
efforts
i
began
at
last
to
think
that
for
some
reason
or
other
i
could
not
be
saved
and
that
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
take
my
fill
of
this
world
as
there
was
no
hope
for
me
beyond
the
grave
while
in
this
state
of
mind
i
came
in
contact
with
persons
holding
sceptical
and
infidel
views
and
accepted
their
teaching
only
too
thankful
for
some
hope
of
escape
from
the
doom
which
if
my
parents
were
right
and
the
bible
true
awaited
the
impenitent
it
may
seem
strange
to
say
it
but
i
have
often
felt
thankful
for
the
experience
of
this
time
of
scepticism
the
inconsistencies
of
christian
people
who
while
professing
to
believe
their
bibles
were
yet
content
to
live
just
as
they
would
if
there
were
no
such
book
had
been
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
of
my
sceptical
companions
and
i
frequently
felt
at
that
time
and
said
that
if
i
pretended
to
believe
the
bible
i
would
at
any
rate
attempt
to
live
by
it
putting
it
fairly
to
the
test
and
if
it
failed
to
prove
true
and
reliable
would
throw
it
overboard
altogether
these
views
i
retained
when
the
lord
was
pleased
to
bring
me
to
himself
and
i
think
i
may
say
that
since
then
i
put
god
word
to
the
test
certainly
it
has
never
failed
me
i
have
never
had
reason
to
regret
the
confidence
i
have
placed
in
its
promises
or
to
deplore
following
the
guidance
i
have
found
in
its
directions
let
me
tell
you
how
god
answered
the
prayers
of
my
dear
mother
and
of
my
beloved
sister
now
broomhall
for
my
conversion
on
a
day
which
i
shall
never
forget
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
of
age
my
dear
mother
being
absent
from
home
i
had
a
holiday
and
in
the
afternoon
looked
through
my
father
library
to
find
some
book
with
which
to
while
away
the
unoccupied
hours
nothing
attracting
me
i
turned
over
a
little
basket
of
pamphlets
and
selected
from
amongst
them
a
gospel
tract
which
looked
interesting
saying
to
myself
there
will
be
a
story
at
the
commencement
and
a
sermon
or
moral
at
the
close
i
will
take
the
former
and
leave
the
latter
for
those
who
like
it
i
sat
down
to
read
the
little
book
in
an
utterly
unconcerned
state
of
mind
believing
indeed
at
the
time
that
if
there
were
any
salvation
it
was
not
for
me
and
with
a
distinct
intention
to
put
away
the
tract
as
soon
as
it
should
seem
prosy
i
may
say
that
it
was
not
uncommon
in
those
days
to
call
conversion
becoming
serious
and
judging
by
the
faces
of
some
of
its
professors
it
appeared
to
be
a
very
serious
matter
indeed
would
it
not
be
well
if
the
people
of
god
had
always
faces
evincing
the
blessings
and
gladness
of
salvation
so
clearly
that
unconverted
people
might
have
to
call
conversion
becoming
joyful
instead
of
becoming
serious
little
did
i
know
at
the
time
what
was
going
on
in
the
heart
of
my
dear
mother
seventy
or
eighty
miles
away
she
rose
from
the
that
afternoon
with
an
intense
yearning
for
the
conversion
of
her
boy
and
feeling
that
absent
from
home
and
having
more
leisure
than
she
could
otherwise
secure
a
special
opportunity
was
afforded
her
of
pleading
with
god
on
my
behalf
she
went
to
her
room
and
turned
the
key
in
the
door
resolved
not
to
leave
that
spot
until
her
prayers
were
answered
hour
after
hour
did
that
dear
mother
plead
for
me
until
at
length
she
could
pray
no
longer
but
was
constrained
to
praise
god
for
that
which
his
spirit
taught
her
had
already
been
accomplished
the
conversion
of
her
only
son
i
in
the
meantime
had
been
led
in
the
way
i
have
mentioned
to
take
up
this
little
tract
and
while
reading
it
was
struck
with
the
sentence
the
finished
work
of
christ
the
thought
passed
through
my
mind
why
does
the
author
use
this
expression
why
not
say
the
atoning
or
propitiatory
work
of
christ
immediately
the
words
it
is
finished
suggested
themselves
to
my
mind
what
was
finished
and
i
at
once
replied
a
full
and
perfect
atonement
and
satisfaction
for
sin
the
debt
was
paid
by
the
substitute
christ
died
for
our
sins
and
not
for
ours
only
but
also
for
the
sins
of
the
whole
world
then
came
the
thought
if
the
whole
work
was
finished
and
the
whole
debt
paid
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
do
and
with
this
dawned
the
joyful
conviction
as
light
was
flashed
into
my
soul
by
the
holy
spirit
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
done
but
to
fall
down
on
one
knees
and
accepting
this
saviour
and
his
salvation
to
praise
him
for
evermore
thus
while
my
dear
mother
was
praising
god
on
her
knees
in
her
chamber
i
was
praising
him
in
the
old
warehouse
to
which
i
had
gone
alone
to
read
at
my
leisure
this
little
book
several
days
elapsed
ere
i
ventured
to
make
my
beloved
sister
the
confidante
of
my
joy
and
then
only
after
she
had
promised
not
to
tell
any
one
of
my
soul
secret
when
our
dear
mother
came
home
a
fortnight
later
i
was
the
first
to
meet
her
at
the
door
and
to
tell
her
i
had
such
glad
news
to
give
i
can
almost
feel
that
dear
mother
arms
around
my
neck
as
she
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
and
said
i
know
my
boy
i
have
been
rejoicing
for
a
fortnight
in
the
glad
tidings
you
have
to
tell
me
why
i
asked
in
surprise
has
amelia
broken
her
promise
she
said
she
would
tell
no
one
my
dear
mother
assured
me
that
it
was
not
from
any
human
source
that
she
had
learned
the
tidings
and
went
on
to
tell
the
little
incident
mentioned
above
you
will
agree
with
me
that
it
would
be
strange
indeed
if
i
were
not
a
believer
in
the
power
of
prayer
nor
was
this
all
some
little
time
after
i
picked
up
a
exactly
like
one
of
my
own
and
thinking
that
it
was
mine
opened
it
the
lines
that
caught
my
eye
were
an
entry
in
the
little
diary
which
belonged
to
my
sister
to
the
effect
that
she
would
give
herself
daily
to
prayer
until
god
should
answer
in
the
conversion
of
her
brother
exactly
one
month
later
the
lord
was
pleased
to
turn
me
from
darkness
to
light
brought
up
in
such
a
circle
and
saved
under
such
circumstances
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
from
the
commencement
of
my
christian
life
i
was
led
to
feel
that
the
promises
were
very
real
and
that
prayer
was
in
sober
matter
of
fact
transacting
business
with
god
whether
on
one
own
behalf
or
on
behalf
of
those
for
whom
one
sought
his
blessing
illustration
chapter
ii
the
call
to
service
the
first
joys
of
conversion
passed
away
after
a
time
and
were
succeeded
by
a
period
of
painful
deadness
of
soul
with
much
conflict
but
this
also
came
to
an
end
leaving
a
deepened
sense
of
personal
weakness
and
dependence
on
the
lord
as
the
only
keeper
as
well
as
saviour
of
his
people
how
sweet
to
the
soul
wearied
and
disappointed
in
its
struggles
with
sin
is
the
calm
repose
of
trust
in
the
shepherd
of
israel
not
many
months
after
my
conversion
having
a
leisure
afternoon
i
retired
to
my
own
chamber
to
spend
it
largely
in
communion
with
god
well
do
i
remember
that
occasion
how
in
the
gladness
of
my
heart
i
poured
out
my
soul
before
god
and
again
and
again
confessing
my
grateful
love
to
him
who
had
done
everything
for
me
who
had
saved
me
when
i
had
given
up
all
hope
and
even
desire
for
salvation
i
besought
him
to
give
me
some
work
to
do
for
him
as
an
outlet
for
love
and
gratitude
some
service
no
matter
what
it
might
be
however
trying
or
however
trivial
something
with
which
he
would
be
pleased
and
that
i
might
do
for
him
who
had
done
so
much
for
me
well
do
i
remember
as
in
unreserved
consecration
i
put
myself
my
life
my
friends
my
all
upon
the
altar
the
deep
solemnity
that
came
over
my
soul
with
the
assurance
that
my
offering
was
accepted
the
presence
of
god
became
unutterably
real
and
blessed
and
though
but
a
child
under
sixteen
i
remember
stretching
myself
on
the
ground
and
lying
there
silent
before
him
with
unspeakable
awe
and
unspeakable
joy
for
what
service
i
was
accepted
i
knew
not
but
a
deep
consciousness
that
i
was
no
longer
my
own
took
possession
of
me
which
has
never
since
been
effaced
it
has
been
a
very
practical
consciousness
two
or
three
years
later
propositions
of
an
unusually
favourable
nature
were
made
to
me
with
regard
to
medical
study
on
the
condition
of
my
becoming
apprenticed
to
the
medical
man
who
was
my
friend
and
teacher
but
i
felt
i
dared
not
accept
any
binding
engagement
such
as
was
suggested
i
was
not
my
own
to
give
myself
away
for
i
knew
not
when
or
how
he
whose
alone
i
was
and
for
whose
disposal
i
felt
i
must
ever
keep
myself
free
might
call
for
service
within
a
few
months
of
this
time
of
consecration
the
impression
was
wrought
into
my
soul
that
it
was
in
china
the
lord
wanted
me
it
seemed
to
me
highly
probable
that
the
work
to
which
i
was
thus
called
might
cost
my
life
for
china
was
not
then
open
as
it
is
now
but
few
missionary
societies
had
at
that
time
workers
in
china
and
but
few
books
on
the
subject
of
china
missions
were
accessible
to
me
i
learned
however
that
the
congregational
minister
of
my
native
town
possessed
a
copy
of
medhurst
and
i
called
upon
him
to
ask
a
loan
of
the
book
this
he
kindly
granted
asking
me
why
i
wished
to
read
it
i
told
him
that
god
had
called
me
to
spend
my
life
in
missionary
service
in
that
land
and
how
do
you
propose
to
go
there
he
inquired
i
answered
that
i
did
not
at
all
know
that
it
seemed
to
me
probable
that
i
should
need
to
do
as
the
twelve
and
the
seventy
had
done
in
judæa
go
without
purse
or
scrip
relying
on
him
who
had
called
me
to
supply
all
my
need
kindly
placing
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
the
minister
replied
ah
my
boy
as
you
grow
older
you
will
get
wiser
than
that
such
an
idea
would
do
very
well
in
the
days
when
christ
himself
was
on
earth
but
not
now
i
have
grown
older
since
then
but
not
wiser
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
if
we
were
to
take
the
directions
of
our
master
and
the
assurances
he
gave
to
his
first
disciples
more
fully
as
our
guide
we
should
find
them
to
be
just
as
suited
to
our
times
as
to
those
in
which
they
were
originally
given
medhurst
book
on
china
emphasised
the
value
of
medical
missions
there
and
this
directed
my
attention
to
medical
studies
as
a
valuable
mode
of
preparation
my
beloved
parents
neither
discouraged
nor
encouraged
my
desire
to
engage
in
missionary
work
they
advised
me
with
such
convictions
to
use
all
the
means
in
my
power
to
develop
the
resources
of
body
mind
heart
and
soul
and
to
wait
prayerfully
upon
god
quite
willing
should
he
show
me
that
i
was
mistaken
to
follow
his
guidance
or
to
go
forward
if
in
due
time
he
should
open
the
way
to
missionary
service
the
importance
of
this
advice
i
have
often
since
had
occasion
to
prove
i
began
to
take
more
exercise
in
the
open
air
to
strengthen
my
physique
my
feather
bed
i
had
taken
away
and
sought
to
dispense
with
as
many
other
home
comforts
as
i
could
in
order
to
prepare
myself
for
rougher
lines
of
life
i
began
also
to
do
what
christian
work
was
in
my
power
in
the
way
of
tract
distribution
teaching
and
visiting
the
poor
and
sick
as
opportunity
afforded
after
a
time
of
preparatory
study
at
home
i
went
to
hull
for
medical
and
surgical
training
there
i
became
assistant
to
a
doctor
who
was
connected
with
the
hull
school
of
medicine
and
was
surgeon
also
to
a
number
of
factories
which
brought
many
accident
cases
to
our
dispensary
and
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
seeing
and
practising
the
minor
operations
of
surgery
and
here
an
event
took
place
that
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
before
leaving
home
my
attention
was
drawn
to
the
subject
of
setting
apart
the
firstfruits
of
all
one
increase
and
a
proportionate
part
of
possessions
to
the
lord
service
i
thought
it
well
to
study
the
question
with
my
bible
in
hand
before
i
went
away
from
home
and
was
placed
in
circumstances
which
might
bias
my
conclusions
by
the
pressure
of
surrounding
wants
and
cares
i
was
thus
led
to
the
determination
to
set
apart
not
less
than
of
whatever
moneys
i
might
earn
or
become
possessed
of
for
the
lord
service
the
salary
i
received
as
medical
assistant
in
hull
at
the
time
now
referred
to
would
have
allowed
me
with
ease
to
do
this
but
owing
to
changes
in
the
family
of
my
kind
friend
and
employer
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
reside
out
of
doors
comfortable
quarters
were
secured
with
a
relative
and
in
addition
to
the
sum
determined
on
as
remuneration
for
my
services
i
received
the
exact
amount
i
had
to
pay
for
board
and
lodging
now
arose
in
my
mind
the
question
ought
not
this
sum
also
to
be
tithed
it
was
surely
a
part
of
my
income
and
i
felt
that
if
it
had
been
a
question
of
government
income
tax
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
excluded
on
the
other
hand
to
take
a
tithe
from
the
whole
would
not
leave
me
sufficient
for
other
purposes
and
for
some
little
time
i
was
much
embarrassed
to
know
what
to
do
after
much
thought
and
prayer
i
was
led
to
leave
the
comfortable
quarters
and
happy
circle
in
which
i
was
now
residing
and
to
engage
a
little
lodging
in
the
suburbs
a
and
bedroom
in
one
undertaking
to
board
myself
in
this
way
i
was
able
without
difficulty
to
tithe
the
whole
of
my
income
and
while
i
felt
the
change
a
good
deal
it
was
attended
with
no
small
blessing
more
time
was
given
in
my
solitude
to
the
study
of
the
word
of
god
to
visiting
the
poor
and
to
evangelistic
work
on
summer
evenings
than
would
otherwise
have
been
the
case
brought
into
contact
in
this
way
with
many
who
were
in
distress
i
soon
saw
the
privilege
of
still
further
economising
and
found
it
not
difficult
to
give
away
much
more
than
the
proportion
of
my
income
i
had
at
first
intended
about
this
time
a
friend
drew
my
attention
to
the
question
of
the
personal
and
coming
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
gave
me
a
list
of
passages
bearing
upon
it
without
note
or
comment
advising
me
to
ponder
the
subject
for
a
while
i
gave
much
time
to
studying
the
scriptures
about
it
with
the
result
that
i
was
led
to
see
that
this
same
jesus
who
left
our
earth
in
his
resurrection
body
was
so
to
come
again
that
his
feet
were
to
stand
on
the
mount
of
olives
and
that
he
was
to
take
possession
of
the
temporal
throne
of
his
father
david
which
was
promised
before
his
birth
i
saw
further
that
all
through
the
new
testament
the
coming
of
the
lord
was
the
great
hope
of
his
people
and
was
always
appealed
to
as
the
strongest
motive
for
consecration
and
service
and
as
the
greatest
comfort
in
trial
and
affliction
i
learned
too
that
the
period
of
his
return
for
his
people
was
not
revealed
and
that
it
was
their
privilege
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
to
live
as
men
who
wait
for
the
lord
that
thus
living
it
was
immaterial
so
to
speak
whether
he
should
or
should
not
come
at
any
particular
hour
the
important
thing
being
to
be
so
ready
for
him
as
to
be
able
whenever
he
might
appear
to
give
an
account
of
one
stewardship
with
joy
and
not
with
grief
the
effect
of
this
blessed
hope
was
a
thoroughly
practical
one
it
led
me
to
look
carefully
through
my
little
library
to
see
if
there
were
any
books
there
that
were
not
needed
or
likely
to
be
of
further
service
and
to
examine
my
small
wardrobe
to
be
quite
sure
that
it
contained
nothing
that
i
should
be
sorry
to
give
an
account
of
should
the
master
come
at
once
the
result
was
that
the
library
was
considerably
diminished
to
the
benefit
of
some
poor
neighbours
and
to
the
far
greater
benefit
of
my
own
and
that
i
found
i
had
articles
of
clothing
also
which
might
be
put
to
better
advantage
in
other
directions
it
has
been
very
helpful
to
me
from
time
to
time
through
life
as
occasion
has
served
to
act
again
in
a
similar
way
and
i
have
never
gone
through
my
house
from
basement
to
attic
with
this
object
in
view
without
receiving
a
great
accession
of
spiritual
joy
and
blessing
i
believe
we
are
all
in
danger
of
accumulating
it
may
be
from
thoughtlessness
or
from
pressure
of
occupation
things
which
would
be
useful
to
others
while
not
needed
by
ourselves
and
the
retention
of
which
entails
loss
of
blessing
if
the
whole
resources
of
the
church
of
god
were
well
utilised
how
much
more
might
be
accomplished
how
many
poor
might
be
fed
and
naked
clothed
and
to
how
many
of
those
as
yet
unreached
the
gospel
might
be
carried
let
me
advise
this
line
of
things
as
a
constant
habit
of
mind
and
a
profitable
course
to
be
practically
adopted
whenever
circumstances
permit
illustration
chapter
iii
preparation
for
service
having
now
the
twofold
object
in
view
of
accustoming
myself
to
endure
hardness
and
of
economising
in
order
to
be
able
more
largely
to
assist
those
amongst
whom
i
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
labouring
in
the
gospel
i
soon
found
that
i
could
live
upon
very
much
less
than
i
had
previously
thought
possible
butter
milk
and
other
such
luxuries
i
soon
ceased
to
use
and
i
found
that
by
living
mainly
on
oatmeal
and
rice
with
occasional
variations
a
very
small
sum
was
sufficient
for
my
needs
in
this
way
i
had
more
than
of
my
income
available
for
other
purposes
and
my
experience
was
that
the
less
i
spent
on
myself
and
the
more
i
gave
away
the
fuller
of
happiness
and
blessing
did
my
soul
become
unspeakable
joy
all
the
day
long
and
every
day
was
my
happy
experience
god
even
my
god
was
a
living
bright
reality
and
all
i
had
to
do
was
joyful
service
it
was
to
me
a
very
grave
matter
however
to
contemplate
going
out
to
china
far
away
from
all
human
aid
there
to
depend
upon
the
living
god
alone
for
protection
supplies
and
help
of
every
kind
i
felt
that
one
spiritual
muscles
required
strengthening
for
such
an
undertaking
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
faith
did
not
fail
god
would
not
fail
but
then
what
if
one
faith
should
prove
insufficient
i
had
not
at
that
time
learned
that
even
if
we
believe
not
he
abideth
faithful
he
can
not
deny
himself
and
it
was
consequently
a
very
serious
question
to
my
mind
not
whether
was
faithful
but
whether
i
had
strong
enough
faith
to
warrant
my
embarking
in
the
enterprise
set
before
me
i
thought
to
myself
when
i
get
out
to
china
i
shall
have
no
claim
on
any
one
for
anything
my
only
claim
will
be
on
god
how
important
therefore
to
learn
before
leaving
england
to
move
man
through
god
by
prayer
alone
at
hull
my
kind
employer
always
busily
occupied
wished
me
to
remind
him
whenever
my
salary
became
due
this
i
determined
not
to
do
directly
but
to
ask
that
god
would
bring
the
fact
to
his
recollection
and
thus
encourage
me
by
answering
prayer
at
one
time
as
the
day
drew
near
for
the
payment
of
a
quarter
salary
i
was
as
usual
much
in
prayer
about
it
the
time
arrived
but
my
kind
friend
made
no
allusion
to
the
matter
i
continued
praying
and
days
passed
on
but
he
did
not
remember
until
at
length
on
settling
up
my
weekly
accounts
one
saturday
night
i
found
myself
possessed
of
only
a
single
coin
one
piece
still
i
had
hitherto
had
no
lack
and
i
continued
in
prayer
that
sunday
was
a
very
happy
one
as
usual
my
heart
was
full
and
brimming
over
with
blessing
after
attending
divine
service
in
the
morning
my
afternoons
and
evenings
were
filled
with
gospel
work
in
the
various
i
was
accustomed
to
visit
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
town
at
such
times
it
almost
seemed
to
me
as
if
heaven
were
begun
below
and
that
all
that
could
be
looked
for
was
an
enlargement
of
capacity
for
joy
not
a
truer
filling
than
i
possessed
after
concluding
my
last
service
about
ten
that
night
a
poor
man
asked
me
to
go
and
pray
with
his
wife
saying
that
she
was
dying
i
readily
agreed
and
on
the
way
to
his
house
asked
him
why
he
had
not
sent
for
the
priest
as
his
accent
told
me
he
was
an
irishman
he
had
done
so
he
said
but
the
priest
refused
to
come
without
a
payment
of
eighteenpence
which
the
man
did
not
possess
as
the
family
was
starving
immediately
it
occurred
to
my
mind
that
all
the
money
i
had
in
the
world
was
the
solitary
and
that
it
was
in
one
coin
moreover
that
while
the
basin
of
water
gruel
i
usually
took
for
supper
was
awaiting
me
and
there
was
sufficient
in
the
house
for
breakfast
in
the
morning
i
certainly
had
nothing
for
dinner
on
the
coming
day
somehow
or
other
there
was
at
once
a
stoppage
in
the
flow
of
joy
in
my
heart
but
instead
of
reproving
myself
i
began
to
reprove
the
poor
man
telling
him
that
it
was
very
wrong
to
have
allowed
matters
to
get
into
such
a
state
as
he
described
and
that
he
ought
to
have
applied
to
the
relieving
officer
his
answer
was
that
he
had
done
so
and
was
told
to
come
at
eleven
the
next
morning
but
that
he
feared
that
his
wife
might
not
live
through
the
night
ah
thought
i
if
only
i
had
two
shillings
and
a
sixpence
instead
of
this
how
gladly
would
i
give
these
poor
people
one
shilling
of
it
but
to
part
with
the
was
far
from
my
thoughts
i
little
dreamed
that
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
simply
was
that
i
could
trust
in
god
plus
but
was
not
yet
prepared
to
trust
him
only
without
any
money
at
all
in
my
pocket
my
conductor
led
me
into
a
court
down
which
i
followed
him
with
some
degree
of
nervousness
i
had
found
myself
there
before
and
at
my
last
visit
had
been
very
roughly
handled
while
my
tracts
were
torn
to
pieces
and
i
received
such
a
warning
not
to
come
again
that
i
felt
more
than
a
little
concerned
still
it
was
the
path
of
duty
and
i
followed
on
up
a
miserable
flight
of
stairs
into
a
wretched
room
he
led
me
and
oh
what
a
sight
there
presented
itself
to
our
eyes
four
or
five
poor
children
stood
about
their
sunken
cheeks
and
temples
all
telling
unmistakably
the
story
of
slow
starvation
and
lying
on
a
wretched
pallet
was
a
poor
exhausted
mother
with
a
tiny
infant
hours
old
moaning
rather
than
crying
at
her
side
for
it
too
seemed
spent
and
failing
ah
thought
i
if
i
had
two
shillings
and
a
sixpence
instead
of
how
gladly
should
they
have
of
it
but
still
a
wretched
unbelief
prevented
me
from
obeying
the
impulse
to
relieve
their
distress
at
the
cost
of
all
i
possessed
it
will
scarcely
seem
strange
that
i
was
unable
to
say
much
to
comfort
these
poor
people
i
needed
comfort
myself
i
began
to
tell
them
however
that
they
must
not
be
cast
down
that
though
their
circumstances
were
very
distressing
there
was
a
kind
and
loving
father
in
heaven
but
something
within
me
said
you
hypocrite
telling
these
unconverted
people
about
a
kind
and
loving
father
in
heaven
and
not
prepared
yourself
to
trust
him
without
i
was
nearly
choked
how
gladly
would
i
have
compromised
with
conscience
if
i
had
had
a
florin
and
a
sixpence
i
would
have
given
the
florin
thankfully
and
kept
the
rest
but
i
was
not
yet
prepared
to
trust
in
god
alone
without
the
sixpence
to
talk
was
impossible
under
these
circumstances
yet
strange
to
say
i
thought
i
should
have
no
difficulty
in
praying
prayer
was
a
delightful
occupation
to
me
in
those
days
time
thus
spent
never
seemed
wearisome
and
i
knew
nothing
of
lack
of
words
i
seemed
to
think
that
all
i
should
have
to
do
would
be
to
kneel
down
and
engage
in
prayer
and
that
relief
would
come
to
them
and
to
myself
together
you
asked
me
to
come
and
pray
with
your
wife
i
said
to
the
man
let
us
pray
and
i
knelt
down
but
scarcely
had
i
opened
my
lips
with
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
than
conscience
said
within
dare
you
mock
god
dare
you
kneel
down
and
call
him
father
with
that
in
your
pocket
such
a
time
of
conflict
came
upon
me
then
as
i
have
never
experienced
before
or
since
how
i
got
through
that
form
of
prayer
i
know
not
and
whether
the
words
uttered
were
connected
or
disconnected
i
can
not
tell
but
i
arose
from
my
knees
in
great
distress
of
mind
the
poor
father
turned
to
me
and
said
you
see
what
a
terrible
state
we
are
in
sir
if
you
can
help
us
for
god
sake
do
just
then
the
word
flashed
into
my
mind
give
to
him
that
asketh
of
thee
and
in
the
word
of
a
king
there
is
power
i
put
my
hand
into
my
pocket
and
slowly
drawing
forth
the
gave
it
to
the
man
telling
him
that
it
might
seem
a
small
matter
for
me
to
relieve
them
seeing
that
i
was
comparatively
well
off
but
that
in
parting
with
that
coin
i
was
giving
him
my
all
what
i
had
been
trying
to
tell
him
was
indeed
true
god
really
was
a
father
and
might
be
trusted
the
joy
all
came
back
in
full
to
my
heart
i
could
say
anything
and
feel
it
then
and
the
hindrance
to
blessing
was
gone
gone
i
trust
for
ever
not
only
was
the
poor
woman
life
saved
but
i
realised
that
my
life
was
saved
too
it
might
have
been
a
wreck
would
have
been
a
wreck
probably
as
a
christian
life
had
not
grace
at
that
time
conquered
and
the
striving
of
god
spirit
been
obeyed
i
well
remember
how
that
night
as
i
went
home
to
my
lodgings
my
heart
was
as
light
as
my
pocket
the
lonely
deserted
streets
resounded
with
a
hymn
of
praise
which
i
could
not
restrain
when
i
took
my
basin
of
gruel
before
retiring
i
would
not
have
exchanged
it
for
a
prince
feast
i
reminded
the
lord
as
i
knelt
at
my
bedside
of
his
own
word
that
he
who
giveth
to
the
poor
lendeth
to
the
lord
i
asked
him
not
to
let
my
loan
be
a
long
one
or
i
should
have
no
dinner
next
day
and
with
peace
within
and
peace
without
i
spent
a
happy
restful
night
next
morning
for
breakfast
my
plate
of
porridge
remained
and
before
it
was
consumed
the
postman
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
i
was
not
in
the
habit
of
receiving
letters
on
monday
as
my
parents
and
most
of
my
friends
refrained
from
posting
on
saturday
so
that
i
was
somewhat
surprised
when
the
landlady
came
in
holding
a
letter
or
packet
in
her
wet
hand
covered
by
her
apron
i
looked
at
the
letter
but
could
not
make
out
the
handwriting
it
was
either
a
strange
hand
or
a
feigned
one
and
the
postmark
was
blurred
where
it
came
from
i
could
not
tell
on
opening
the
envelope
i
found
nothing
written
within
but
inside
a
sheet
of
blank
paper
was
folded
a
pair
of
kid
gloves
from
which
as
i
opened
them
in
astonishment
fell
to
the
ground
praise
the
lord
i
exclaimed
per
cent
for
twelve
hours
investment
that
is
good
interest
how
glad
the
merchants
of
hull
would
be
if
they
could
lend
their
money
at
such
a
rate
i
then
and
there
determined
that
a
bank
which
could
not
break
should
have
my
savings
or
earnings
as
the
case
might
be
a
determination
i
have
not
yet
learned
to
regret
i
can
not
tell
you
how
often
my
mind
has
recurred
to
this
incident
or
all
the
help
it
has
been
to
me
in
circumstances
of
difficulty
in
if
we
are
faithful
to
god
in
little
things
we
shall
gain
experience
and
strength
that
will
be
helpful
to
us
in
the
more
serious
trials
of
life
illustration
chapter
iv
further
answers
to
prayer
the
remarkable
and
gracious
deliverance
i
have
spoken
of
was
a
great
joy
to
me
as
well
as
a
strong
confirmation
of
faith
but
of
course
ten
shillings
however
economically
used
will
not
go
very
far
and
it
was
none
the
less
necessary
to
continue
in
prayer
asking
that
the
larger
supply
which
was
still
due
might
be
remembered
and
paid
all
my
petitions
however
appeared
to
remain
unanswered
and
before
a
fortnight
had
elapsed
i
found
myself
pretty
much
in
the
same
position
that
i
had
occupied
on
the
sunday
night
already
made
so
memorable
meanwhile
i
continued
pleading
with
god
more
and
more
earnestly
that
he
would
graciously
remind
my
employer
that
my
salary
was
overdue
of
course
it
was
not
the
want
of
the
money
that
distressed
me
that
could
have
been
had
at
any
time
for
the
asking
but
the
question
uppermost
in
my
mind
was
this
can
i
go
to
china
or
will
my
want
of
faith
and
power
with
god
prove
to
be
so
serious
an
obstacle
as
to
preclude
my
entering
upon
this
service
as
the
week
drew
to
a
close
i
felt
exceedingly
embarrassed
there
was
not
only
myself
to
consider
on
saturday
night
a
payment
would
be
due
to
my
christian
landlady
which
i
knew
she
could
not
well
dispense
with
ought
i
not
for
her
sake
to
speak
about
the
matter
of
the
salary
yet
to
do
so
would
be
to
myself
at
any
rate
the
admission
that
i
was
not
fitted
to
undertake
a
missionary
enterprise
i
gave
nearly
the
whole
of
thursday
and
friday
all
the
time
not
occupied
in
my
necessary
employment
to
earnest
wrestling
with
god
in
prayer
but
still
on
saturday
morning
i
was
in
the
same
position
as
before
and
now
my
earnest
cry
was
for
guidance
as
to
whether
it
was
my
duty
to
break
silence
and
speak
to
my
employer
or
whether
i
should
still
continue
to
wait
the
father
time
as
far
as
i
could
judge
i
received
the
assurance
that
to
wait
his
time
was
best
and
that
god
in
some
way
or
other
would
interpose
on
my
behalf
so
i
waited
my
heart
being
now
at
rest
and
the
burden
gone
about
five
that
saturday
afternoon
when
the
doctor
had
finished
writing
his
prescriptions
his
last
circuit
for
the
day
being
taken
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
as
he
was
wont
and
began
to
speak
of
the
things
of
god
he
was
a
truly
christian
man
and
many
seasons
of
very
happy
spiritual
fellowship
we
had
together
i
was
busily
watching
at
the
time
a
pan
in
which
a
decoction
was
boiling
that
required
a
good
deal
of
attention
it
was
indeed
fortunate
for
me
that
it
was
so
for
without
any
obvious
connection
with
what
had
been
going
on
all
at
once
he
said
taylor
is
not
your
salary
due
again
my
emotion
may
be
imagined
i
had
to
swallow
two
or
three
times
before
i
could
answer
with
my
eye
fixed
on
the
pan
and
my
back
to
the
doctor
i
told
him
as
quietly
as
i
could
that
it
was
overdue
some
little
time
how
thankful
i
felt
at
that
moment
god
surely
had
heard
my
prayer
and
caused
him
in
this
time
of
my
great
need
to
remember
the
salary
without
any
word
or
suggestion
from
me
he
replied
oh
i
am
so
sorry
you
did
not
remind
me
you
know
how
busy
i
am
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
it
a
little
sooner
for
only
this
afternoon
i
sent
all
the
money
i
had
to
the
bank
otherwise
i
would
pay
you
at
once
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
revulsion
of
feeling
caused
by
this
unexpected
statement
i
knew
not
what
to
do
fortunately
for
me
my
pan
boiled
up
and
i
had
a
good
reason
for
rushing
with
it
from
the
room
glad
indeed
i
was
to
get
away
and
keep
out
of
sight
until
after
the
doctor
had
returned
to
his
house
and
most
thankful
that
he
had
not
perceived
my
emotion
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
had
to
seek
my
little
sanctum
and
pour
out
my
heart
before
the
lord
for
some
time
before
calmness
and
more
than
calmness
thankfulness
and
joy
were
restored
to
me
i
felt
that
god
had
his
own
way
and
was
not
going
to
fail
me
i
had
sought
to
know
his
will
early
in
the
day
and
as
far
as
i
could
judge
had
received
guidance
to
wait
patiently
and
now
god
was
going
to
work
for
me
in
some
other
way
that
evening
was
spent
as
my
saturday
evenings
usually
were
in
reading
the
word
and
preparing
the
subjects
on
which
i
expected
to
speak
in
the
various
on
the
morrow
i
waited
perhaps
a
little
longer
than
usual
at
last
about
ten
there
being
no
interruption
of
any
kind
i
put
on
my
overcoat
and
was
preparing
to
leave
for
home
rather
thankful
to
know
that
by
that
time
i
should
have
to
let
myself
in
with
the
as
my
landlady
retired
early
to
rest
there
was
certainly
no
help
for
that
night
but
perhaps
god
would
interpose
for
me
by
monday
and
i
might
be
able
to
pay
my
landlady
early
in
the
week
the
money
i
would
have
given
her
before
had
it
been
possible
just
as
i
was
preparing
to
turn
down
the
gas
i
heard
the
doctor
step
in
the
garden
which
lay
between
the
and
surgery
he
was
laughing
to
himself
very
heartily
as
though
greatly
amused
by
something
entering
the
surgery
he
asked
for
the
ledger
and
told
me
that
strange
to
say
one
of
his
richest
patients
had
just
come
to
pay
his
doctor
bill
was
it
not
an
odd
thing
to
do
it
never
struck
me
that
it
might
have
any
bearing
on
my
own
particular
case
or
i
might
have
felt
embarrassed
but
looking
at
it
simply
from
the
position
of
an
uninterested
spectator
i
also
was
highly
amused
that
a
man
who
was
rolling
in
wealth
should
come
after
ten
at
night
to
pay
a
doctor
bill
which
he
could
any
day
have
met
by
a
cheque
with
the
greatest
ease
it
appeared
that
somehow
or
other
he
could
not
rest
with
this
on
his
mind
and
had
been
constrained
to
come
at
that
unusual
hour
to
discharge
his
liability
the
account
was
duly
receipted
in
the
ledger
and
the
doctor
was
about
to
leave
when
suddenly
he
turned
and
handing
me
some
of
the
bank
notes
just
received
said
to
my
surprise
and
thankfulness
by
the
way
taylor
you
might
as
well
take
these
notes
i
have
not
any
change
but
can
give
you
the
balance
next
week
again
i
was
left
my
feelings
undiscovered
to
go
back
to
my
own
little
closet
and
praise
the
lord
with
a
joyful
heart
that
after
all
i
might
go
to
china
to
me
this
incident
was
not
a
trivial
one
and
to
recall
it
sometimes
in
circumstances
of
great
difficulty
in
china
or
elsewhere
has
proved
no
small
comfort
and
strength
the
time
drew
near
when
it
was
thought
desirable
that
i
should
leave
hull
to
attend
the
medical
course
of
the
london
hospital
a
little
while
spent
there
and
then
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
my
in
china
would
commence
but
much
as
i
had
rejoiced
at
the
willingness
of
god
to
hear
and
answer
prayer
and
to
help
his
child
i
felt
that
i
could
not
go
to
china
without
having
still
further
developed
and
tested
my
power
to
rest
upon
his
faithfulness
and
a
marked
opportunity
for
doing
so
was
providentially
afforded
me
my
dear
father
had
offered
to
bear
all
the
expense
of
my
stay
in
london
i
knew
however
that
owing
to
recent
losses
it
would
mean
a
considerable
sacrifice
for
him
to
undertake
this
just
when
it
seemed
necessary
for
me
to
go
forward
i
had
recently
become
acquainted
with
the
committee
of
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
in
connection
with
which
i
ultimately
left
for
china
and
especially
with
its
secretary
my
esteemed
and
friend
george
pearse
then
of
the
stock
exchange
but
now
and
for
many
years
himself
a
missionary
not
knowing
of
my
father
proposition
the
committee
also
kindly
offered
to
bear
my
expenses
while
in
london
when
these
proposals
were
first
made
to
me
i
was
not
quite
clear
as
to
what
i
ought
to
do
and
in
writing
to
my
father
and
the
secretaries
told
them
that
i
would
take
a
few
days
to
pray
about
the
matter
before
deciding
any
course
of
action
i
mentioned
to
my
father
that
i
had
had
this
offer
from
the
society
and
told
the
secretaries
also
of
his
proffered
aid
subsequently
while
waiting
upon
god
in
prayer
for
guidance
it
became
clear
to
my
mind
that
i
could
without
difficulty
decline
both
offers
the
secretaries
of
the
society
would
not
know
that
i
had
cast
myself
wholly
on
god
for
supplies
and
my
father
would
conclude
that
i
had
accepted
the
other
offer
i
therefore
wrote
declining
both
propositions
and
felt
that
without
any
one
having
either
care
or
anxiety
on
my
account
i
was
simply
in
the
hands
of
god
and
that
he
who
knew
my
heart
if
he
wished
to
encourage
me
to
go
to
china
would
bless
my
effort
to
depend
upon
him
alone
at
home
illustration
footnote
since
the
above
was
written
george
pearse
has
died
chapter
v
life
in
london
i
must
not
now
attempt
to
detail
the
ways
in
which
the
lord
was
pleased
often
to
my
surprise
as
well
as
to
my
delight
to
help
me
from
time
to
time
i
soon
found
that
it
was
not
possible
to
live
quite
as
economically
in
london
as
in
hull
to
lessen
expenses
i
shared
a
room
with
a
cousin
four
miles
from
the
hospital
providing
myself
with
board
and
after
various
experiments
i
found
that
the
most
economical
way
was
to
live
almost
exclusively
on
brown
bread
and
water
thus
i
was
able
to
make
the
means
that
god
gave
me
last
as
long
as
possible
some
of
my
expenses
i
could
not
diminish
but
my
board
was
largely
within
my
own
control
a
large
twopenny
loaf
of
brown
bread
purchased
daily
on
my
long
walk
from
the
hospital
furnished
me
with
supper
and
breakfast
and
on
that
diet
with
a
few
apples
for
lunch
i
managed
to
walk
eight
or
nine
miles
a
day
besides
being
a
good
deal
on
foot
while
attending
the
practice
of
the
hospital
and
the
medical
school
one
incident
that
occurred
just
about
this
time
i
must
refer
to
the
husband
of
my
former
landlady
in
hull
was
chief
officer
of
a
ship
that
sailed
from
london
and
by
receiving
his
monthly
and
remitting
it
to
her
i
was
able
to
save
her
the
cost
of
a
commission
this
i
had
been
doing
for
several
months
when
she
wrote
requesting
that
i
would
obtain
the
next
payment
as
early
as
possible
as
her
rent
was
almost
due
and
she
depended
upon
that
sum
to
meet
it
the
request
came
at
an
inconvenient
time
i
was
working
hard
for
an
examination
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
a
scholarship
which
would
be
of
service
to
me
and
felt
that
i
could
ill
afford
the
time
to
go
during
the
busiest
part
of
the
day
to
the
city
and
procure
the
money
i
had
however
sufficient
of
my
own
in
hand
to
enable
me
to
send
the
required
sum
i
made
the
remittance
therefore
purposing
as
soon
as
the
examination
was
over
to
go
and
draw
the
regular
allowance
with
which
to
refund
myself
before
the
time
of
examination
the
medical
school
was
closed
for
a
day
on
account
of
the
funeral
of
the
duke
of
wellington
and
i
had
an
opportunity
of
going
at
once
to
the
office
which
was
situated
in
a
street
on
cheapside
and
applying
for
the
due
amount
to
my
surprise
and
dismay
the
cleric
told
me
that
he
could
not
pay
it
as
the
officer
in
question
had
run
away
from
his
ship
and
gone
to
the
gold
diggings
well
i
remarked
that
is
very
inconvenient
for
me
as
i
have
already
advanced
the
money
and
i
know
his
wife
will
have
no
means
of
repaying
it
the
clerk
said
he
was
sorry
but
could
of
course
only
act
according
to
orders
so
there
was
no
help
for
me
in
that
direction
a
little
more
time
and
thought
however
brought
the
comforting
conclusion
to
my
mind
that
as
i
was
depending
on
the
lord
for
everything
and
his
means
were
not
limited
it
was
a
small
matter
to
be
brought
a
little
sooner
or
later
into
the
position
of
needing
fresh
supplies
from
him
and
so
the
joy
and
the
peace
were
not
long
interfered
with
very
soon
after
this
possibly
the
same
evening
while
sewing
together
some
sheets
of
paper
on
which
to
take
notes
of
the
lectures
i
accidentally
pricked
the
first
finger
of
my
right
hand
and
in
a
few
moments
forgot
all
about
it
the
next
day
at
the
hospital
i
continued
dissecting
as
before
the
body
was
that
of
a
person
who
had
died
of
fever
and
was
more
than
usually
disagreeable
and
dangerous
i
need
scarcely
say
that
those
of
us
who
were
at
work
upon
it
dissected
with
special
care
knowing
that
the
slightest
scratch
might
cost
us
our
lives
before
the
morning
was
far
advanced
i
began
to
feel
very
weary
and
while
going
through
the
surgical
wards
at
noon
was
obliged
to
run
out
being
suddenly
very
sick
a
most
unusual
circumstance
with
me
as
i
took
but
little
food
and
nothing
that
could
disagree
with
me
after
feeling
faint
for
some
time
a
draught
of
cold
water
revived
me
and
i
was
able
to
rejoin
the
students
i
became
more
and
more
unwell
however
and
ere
the
afternoon
lecture
on
surgery
was
over
found
it
impossible
to
hold
the
pencil
and
continue
taking
notes
by
the
time
the
next
lecture
was
through
my
whole
arm
and
right
side
were
full
of
severe
pain
and
i
was
both
looking
and
feeling
very
finding
that
i
could
not
resume
work
i
went
into
the
to
bind
up
the
portion
i
was
engaged
upon
and
put
away
my
apparatus
and
said
to
the
demonstrator
who
was
a
very
skilful
surgeon
i
can
not
think
what
has
come
over
me
describing
the
symptoms
why
said
he
what
has
happened
is
clear
enough
you
must
have
cut
yourself
in
dissecting
and
you
know
that
this
is
a
case
of
malignant
fever
i
assured
him
that
i
had
been
most
careful
and
was
quite
certain
that
i
had
no
cut
or
scratch
well
he
replied
you
certainly
must
have
had
one
and
he
very
closely
scrutinised
my
hand
to
find
it
but
in
vain
all
at
once
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
pricked
my
finger
the
night
before
and
i
asked
him
if
it
were
possible
that
a
prick
from
a
needle
at
that
time
could
have
been
still
unclosed
his
opinion
was
that
this
was
probably
the
cause
of
the
trouble
and
he
advised
me
to
get
a
hansom
drive
home
as
fast
as
i
could
and
arrange
my
affairs
forthwith
for
he
said
you
are
a
dead
man
my
first
thought
was
one
of
sorrow
that
i
could
not
go
to
china
but
very
soon
came
the
feeling
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
i
have
work
to
do
in
china
and
shall
not
die
i
was
glad
however
to
take
the
opportunity
of
speaking
to
my
medical
friend
who
was
a
confirmed
sceptic
as
to
things
spiritual
of
the
joy
that
the
prospect
of
perhaps
soon
being
with
my
master
gave
me
telling
him
at
the
same
time
that
i
did
not
think
i
should
die
as
unless
i
were
much
mistaken
i
had
work
to
do
in
china
and
if
so
however
severe
the
struggle
i
must
be
brought
through
that
is
all
very
well
he
answered
but
you
get
a
hansom
and
drive
home
as
fast
as
you
can
you
have
no
time
to
lose
for
you
will
soon
be
incapable
of
winding
up
your
affairs
i
smiled
a
little
at
the
idea
of
my
driving
home
in
a
hansom
for
by
this
time
my
means
were
too
exhausted
to
allow
of
such
a
proceeding
and
i
set
out
to
walk
the
distance
if
possible
before
long
however
my
strength
gave
way
and
i
felt
it
was
no
use
to
attempt
to
reach
home
by
walking
availing
myself
of
an
omnibus
from
whitechapel
church
to
farringdon
street
and
another
from
farringdon
street
onwards
i
reached
in
great
suffering
the
neighbourhood
of
soho
square
behind
which
i
lived
on
going
into
the
house
i
got
some
hot
water
from
the
servant
and
charging
her
very
earnestly
literally
as
a
dying
man
to
accept
eternal
life
as
the
gift
of
god
through
jesus
christ
i
bathed
my
head
and
lanced
the
finger
hoping
to
let
out
some
of
the
poisoned
blood
the
pain
was
very
severe
i
fainted
away
and
was
for
some
time
unconscious
so
long
that
when
i
came
to
myself
i
found
that
i
had
been
carried
to
bed
an
uncle
of
mine
who
lived
near
at
hand
had
come
in
and
sent
for
his
own
medical
man
an
assistant
surgeon
at
the
westminster
hospital
i
assured
my
uncle
that
medical
help
would
be
of
no
service
to
me
and
that
i
did
not
wish
to
go
to
the
expense
involved
he
however
quieted
me
on
this
score
saying
that
he
had
sent
for
his
own
doctor
and
that
the
bill
would
be
charged
to
himself
when
the
surgeon
came
and
learned
all
the
particulars
he
said
well
if
you
have
been
living
moderately
you
may
pull
through
but
if
you
have
been
going
in
for
beer
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
is
no
manner
of
chance
for
you
i
thought
that
if
sober
living
was
to
do
anything
few
could
have
a
better
chance
as
little
but
bread
and
water
had
been
my
diet
for
a
good
while
past
i
told
him
i
had
lived
abstemiously
and
found
that
it
helped
me
in
study
but
now
he
said
you
must
keep
up
your
strength
for
it
will
be
a
pretty
hard
struggle
and
he
ordered
me
a
bottle
of
port
wine
every
day
and
as
many
chops
as
i
could
consume
again
i
smiled
inwardly
having
no
means
for
the
purchase
of
such
luxuries
this
difficulty
however
was
also
met
by
my
kind
uncle
who
sent
me
at
once
all
that
was
needed
i
was
much
concerned
notwithstanding
the
agony
i
suffered
that
my
dear
parents
should
not
be
made
acquainted
with
my
state
thought
and
prayer
had
satisfied
me
that
i
was
not
going
to
die
but
that
there
was
indeed
a
work
for
me
to
do
in
china
if
my
dear
parents
should
come
up
and
find
me
in
that
condition
i
must
lose
the
opportunity
of
seeing
how
god
was
going
to
work
for
me
now
that
my
money
had
almost
come
to
an
end
so
after
prayer
for
guidance
i
obtained
a
promise
from
my
uncle
and
cousin
not
to
write
to
my
parents
but
to
leave
me
to
communicate
with
them
myself
i
felt
it
was
a
very
distinct
answer
to
prayer
when
they
gave
me
this
promise
and
i
took
care
to
defer
all
communication
with
them
myself
until
the
crisis
was
past
and
the
worst
of
the
attack
over
at
home
they
knew
that
i
was
working
hard
for
an
examination
and
did
not
wonder
at
my
silence
days
and
nights
of
suffering
passed
slowly
by
but
at
length
after
several
weeks
i
was
sufficiently
restored
to
leave
my
room
and
then
i
learned
that
two
men
though
not
from
the
london
hospital
who
had
had
dissection
wounds
at
the
same
time
as
myself
had
both
succumbed
while
i
was
spared
in
answer
to
prayer
to
work
for
god
in
china

chapter
vi
strengthened
by
faith
one
day
the
doctor
coming
in
found
me
on
the
sofa
and
was
surprised
to
learn
that
with
assistance
i
had
walked
downstairs
now
he
said
the
best
thing
you
can
go
is
to
get
off
to
the
country
as
soon
as
you
feel
equal
to
the
journey
you
must
rusticate
until
you
have
recovered
a
fair
amount
of
health
and
strength
for
if
you
begin
your
work
too
soon
the
consequences
may
still
be
serious
when
he
had
left
as
i
lay
very
exhausted
on
the
sofa
i
just
told
the
lord
all
about
it
and
that
i
was
refraining
from
making
my
circumstances
known
to
those
who
would
delight
to
meet
my
need
in
order
that
my
faith
might
be
strengthened
by
receiving
help
from
himself
in
answer
to
prayer
alone
what
was
i
to
do
and
i
waited
for
his
answer
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
he
were
directing
my
mind
to
the
conclusion
to
go
again
to
the
shipping
office
and
inquire
about
the
wages
i
had
been
unable
to
draw
i
reminded
the
lord
that
i
could
not
afford
to
take
a
conveyance
and
that
it
did
not
seem
at
all
likely
that
i
should
succeed
in
getting
the
money
and
asked
whether
this
impulse
was
not
a
mere
clutching
at
a
straw
some
mental
process
of
my
own
rather
than
his
guidance
and
teaching
after
prayer
however
and
renewed
waiting
upon
god
i
was
confirmed
in
my
belief
that
he
himself
was
teaching
me
to
go
to
the
office
the
next
question
was
how
am
i
to
go
i
had
had
to
seek
help
in
coming
downstairs
and
the
place
was
at
least
two
miles
away
the
assurance
was
brought
vividly
home
to
me
that
whatever
i
asked
of
god
in
the
name
of
christ
would
be
done
that
the
father
might
be
glorified
in
the
son
that
what
i
had
to
do
was
to
seek
strength
for
the
long
walk
to
receive
it
by
faith
and
to
set
out
upon
it
unhesitatingly
i
told
the
lord
that
i
was
quite
willing
to
take
the
walk
if
he
would
give
me
the
strength
i
asked
in
the
name
of
christ
that
the
strength
might
be
immediately
given
and
sending
the
servant
up
to
my
room
for
my
hat
and
stick
i
set
out
not
to
to
walk
but
to
walk
to
cheapside
although
undoubtedly
strengthened
by
faith
i
never
took
so
much
interest
in
shop
windows
as
i
did
upon
that
journey
at
every
second
or
third
step
i
was
glad
to
lean
a
little
against
the
plate
glass
and
take
time
to
examine
the
contents
of
the
windows
before
passing
on
it
needed
a
special
effort
of
faith
when
i
got
to
the
bottom
of
farringdon
street
to
attempt
the
toilsome
ascent
of
snow
hill
there
was
no
holborn
viaduct
in
those
days
and
it
had
to
be
done
god
did
wonderfully
help
me
and
in
due
time
i
reached
cheapside
turned
into
the
in
which
the
office
was
found
and
sat
down
much
exhausted
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
first
floor
which
was
my
destination
i
felt
my
position
to
be
a
little
peculiar
sitting
there
on
the
steps
so
evidently
spent
and
the
gentlemen
who
rushed
up
and
downstairs
looked
at
me
with
an
inquiring
gaze
after
a
little
rest
however
and
a
further
season
of
prayer
i
succeeded
in
climbing
the
staircase
and
to
my
comfort
found
in
the
office
the
clerk
with
whom
i
had
hitherto
dealt
in
the
matter
seeing
me
looking
pale
and
exhausted
he
kindly
inquired
as
to
my
health
and
i
told
him
that
i
had
had
a
serious
illness
and
was
ordered
to
the
country
but
thought
it
well
to
call
first
and
make
further
inquiry
lest
there
should
have
been
any
mistake
about
the
mate
having
run
off
to
the
gold
diggings
oh
he
said
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
for
it
turns
out
that
it
was
an
able
seaman
of
the
same
name
that
ran
away
the
mate
is
still
on
board
the
ship
has
just
reached
gravesend
and
will
be
up
very
soon
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
the
up
to
date
for
doubtless
it
will
reach
his
wife
more
safely
through
you
we
all
know
what
temptations
beset
the
men
when
they
arrive
at
home
after
a
voyage
before
however
giving
me
the
sum
of
money
he
insisted
upon
my
coming
inside
and
sharing
his
lunch
i
felt
it
was
the
lord
indeed
who
was
providing
for
me
and
accepted
his
offer
with
thankfulness
when
i
was
refreshed
and
rested
he
gave
me
a
sheet
of
paper
to
write
a
few
lines
to
the
wife
telling
her
of
the
circumstances
on
my
way
back
i
procured
in
cheapside
a
money
order
for
the
balance
due
to
her
and
posted
it
and
returning
home
again
felt
myself
now
quite
justified
in
taking
an
omnibus
as
far
as
it
would
serve
me
very
much
better
the
next
morning
after
seeing
to
some
little
matters
that
i
had
to
settle
i
made
my
way
to
the
surgery
of
the
doctor
who
had
attended
me
feeling
that
although
my
uncle
was
prepared
to
pay
the
bill
it
was
right
for
me
now
that
i
had
some
money
in
hand
to
ask
for
the
account
myself
the
kind
surgeon
refused
to
allow
me
as
a
medical
student
to
pay
anything
for
his
attendance
but
he
had
supplied
me
with
quinine
which
he
allowed
me
to
pay
for
to
the
extent
of
eight
shillings
when
that
was
settled
i
saw
that
the
sum
left
was
just
sufficient
to
take
me
home
and
to
my
mind
the
whole
thing
seemed
a
wonderful
interposition
of
god
on
my
behalf
i
knew
that
the
surgeon
was
sceptical
and
told
him
that
i
should
very
much
like
to
speak
to
him
freely
if
i
might
do
so
without
offence
that
i
felt
that
under
god
i
owed
my
life
to
his
kind
care
and
wished
very
earnestly
that
he
himself
might
become
a
partaker
of
the
same
precious
faith
that
i
possessed
so
i
told
him
my
reason
for
being
in
london
and
about
my
circumstances
and
why
i
had
declined
the
help
of
both
my
father
and
the
officers
of
the
society
in
connection
with
which
it
was
probable
that
i
should
go
to
china
i
told
him
of
the
recent
providential
dealings
of
god
with
me
and
how
apparently
hopeless
my
position
had
been
the
day
before
when
he
had
ordered
me
to
go
to
the
country
unless
i
would
reveal
my
need
which
i
had
determined
not
to
do
i
described
to
him
the
mental
exercises
i
had
gone
through
but
when
i
added
that
i
had
actually
got
up
from
the
sofa
and
walked
to
cheapside
he
looked
at
me
incredulously
and
impossible
why
i
left
you
lying
there
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
man
and
i
had
to
assure
him
again
and
again
that
strengthened
by
faith
the
walk
had
really
been
taken
i
told
him
also
what
money
was
left
to
me
and
what
payments
there
had
been
to
make
and
showed
him
that
just
sufficient
remained
to
take
me
home
to
yorkshire
providing
for
needful
refreshment
by
the
way
and
the
omnibus
journey
at
the
end
my
kind
friend
was
completely
broken
down
and
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
i
would
give
all
the
world
for
a
faith
like
yours
i
on
the
other
hand
had
the
joy
of
telling
him
that
it
was
to
be
obtained
without
money
and
without
price
we
never
met
again
when
i
came
back
to
town
restored
to
health
and
strength
i
found
that
he
had
had
a
stroke
and
left
for
the
country
and
i
subsequently
learned
that
he
never
rallied
i
was
able
to
gain
no
information
as
to
his
state
of
mind
when
taken
away
but
i
have
always
felt
very
thankful
that
i
had
the
opportunity
and
embraced
it
of
bearing
that
testimony
for
god
i
can
not
but
entertain
the
hope
that
the
master
himself
was
speaking
to
him
through
his
dealings
with
me
and
that
i
shall
meet
him
again
in
the
better
land
it
would
be
no
small
joy
to
be
welcomed
by
him
when
my
own
service
is
over
the
next
day
found
me
in
my
dear
parents
home
my
joy
in
the
help
and
deliverance
was
so
great
that
i
was
unable
to
keep
it
to
myself
and
before
my
return
to
london
my
dear
mother
knew
the
secret
of
my
life
for
some
time
past
i
need
scarcely
say
that
when
i
went
up
again
to
town
i
was
not
allowed
to
live
as
indeed
i
was
not
fit
to
live
on
the
same
economical
lines
as
before
my
illness
i
needed
more
now
and
the
lord
did

mighty
to
save
returning
to
london
when
sufficiently
recovered
to
resume
my
studies
the
busy
life
of
hospital
and
was
resumed
often
relieved
by
happy
sundays
of
fellowship
with
christian
friends
especially
in
london
or
tottenham
opportunities
for
service
are
to
be
found
in
every
sphere
and
mine
was
no
exception
i
shall
only
mention
one
case
now
that
gave
me
great
encouragement
in
seeking
conversion
even
when
it
seemed
apparently
hopeless
god
had
given
me
the
joy
of
winning
souls
before
but
not
in
surroundings
of
such
special
difficulty
with
god
all
things
are
possible
and
no
conversion
ever
takes
place
save
by
the
almighty
power
of
the
holy
ghost
the
great
need
therefore
of
every
christian
worker
is
to
god
indeed
this
is
the
purpose
for
which
he
has
given
us
eternal
life
as
our
saviour
himself
says
in
the
oft
misquoted
verse
john
xvii
this
is
the
object
of
life
eternal
not
know
but
that
they
know
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
hast
sent
i
was
now
to
prove
the
willingness
of
god
to
answer
prayer
for
spiritual
blessing
under
most
unpromising
circumstances
and
thus
to
gain
an
increased
acquaintance
with
the
god
as
one
mighty
to
save
a
short
time
before
leaving
for
china
it
became
my
duty
daily
to
dress
the
foot
of
a
patient
suffering
from
senile
gangrene
the
disease
commenced
as
usual
insidiously
and
the
patient
had
little
idea
that
he
was
a
doomed
man
and
probably
had
not
long
to
live
i
was
not
the
first
to
attend
to
him
but
when
the
case
was
transferred
to
me
i
naturally
became
very
anxious
about
his
soul
the
family
with
whom
he
lived
were
christians
and
from
them
i
learned
that
he
was
an
avowed
atheist
and
very
antagonistic
to
anything
religious
they
had
without
asking
his
consent
invited
a
scripture
reader
to
visit
him
but
in
great
passion
he
had
ordered
him
from
the
room
the
vicar
of
the
district
had
also
called
hoping
to
help
him
but
he
had
spit
in
his
face
and
refused
to
allow
him
to
speak
to
him
his
passionate
temper
was
described
to
me
as
very
violent
and
altogether
the
case
seemed
to
be
as
hopeless
as
could
well
be
imagined
upon
first
commencing
to
attend
him
i
prayed
much
about
it
but
for
two
or
three
days
said
nothing
to
him
of
a
religious
nature
by
special
care
in
dressing
his
diseased
limb
i
was
able
considerably
to
lessen
his
sufferings
and
he
soon
began
to
manifest
grateful
appreciation
of
my
services
one
day
with
a
trembling
heart
i
took
advantage
of
his
warm
acknowledgments
to
tell
him
what
was
the
spring
of
my
action
and
to
speak
of
his
own
solemn
position
and
need
of
god
mercy
through
christ
it
was
evidently
only
by
a
powerful
effort
of
that
he
kept
his
lips
closed
he
turned
over
in
bed
with
his
back
to
me
and
uttered
no
word
i
could
not
get
the
poor
man
out
of
my
mind
and
very
often
through
each
day
i
pleaded
with
god
by
his
spirit
to
save
him
ere
he
took
him
hence
after
dressing
the
wound
and
relieving
his
pain
i
never
failed
to
say
a
few
words
to
him
which
i
hoped
the
lord
would
bless
he
always
turned
his
back
to
me
looking
annoyed
but
never
spoke
a
word
in
reply
after
continuing
this
for
some
time
my
heart
sank
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
not
only
doing
no
good
but
perhaps
really
hardening
him
and
increasing
his
guilt
one
day
after
dressing
his
limb
and
washing
my
hands
instead
of
returning
to
the
bedside
to
speak
to
him
i
went
to
the
door
and
stood
hesitating
for
a
few
moments
with
the
thought
in
my
mind
ephraim
is
joined
to
his
idols
let
him
alone
i
looked
at
the
man
and
saw
his
surprise
as
it
was
the
first
time
since
speaking
to
him
that
i
had
attempted
to
leave
without
going
up
to
his
bedside
to
say
a
few
words
for
my
master
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
bursting
into
tears
i
crossed
the
room
and
said
my
friend
whether
you
will
hear
or
whether
you
will
forbear
i
deliver
soul
and
went
on
to
speak
very
earnestly
to
him
telling
him
with
many
tears
how
much
i
wished
that
he
would
let
me
pray
with
him
to
my
unspeakable
joy
he
did
not
turn
away
but
replied
if
it
will
be
a
relief
to
you
do
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
fell
on
my
knees
and
poured
out
my
whole
soul
to
god
on
his
behalf
i
believe
the
lord
then
and
there
wrought
a
change
in
his
soul
he
was
never
afterwards
unwilling
to
be
spoken
to
and
prayed
with
and
within
a
few
days
he
definitely
accepted
christ
as
his
saviour
oh
the
joy
it
was
to
me
to
see
that
dear
man
rejoicing
in
hope
of
the
glory
of
god
he
told
me
that
for
forty
years
he
had
never
darkened
the
door
of
church
or
chapel
and
that
then
forty
years
ago
he
had
only
entered
a
place
of
worship
to
be
married
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
go
inside
when
his
wife
was
buried
now
thank
god
his
soul
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
was
washed
was
sanctified
was
justified
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
and
in
the
spirit
of
our
god
oftentimes
when
in
my
early
work
in
china
circumstances
rendered
me
almost
hopeless
of
success
i
have
thought
of
this
man
conversion
and
have
been
encouraged
to
persevere
in
speaking
the
word
whether
men
would
hear
or
whether
they
would
forbear
the
now
happy
sufferer
lived
for
some
time
after
this
change
and
was
never
tired
of
bearing
testimony
to
the
grace
of
god
though
his
condition
was
most
distressing
the
alteration
in
his
character
and
behaviour
made
the
previously
painful
duty
of
attending
him
one
of
real
pleasure
i
have
often
thought
since
in
connection
with
this
case
and
the
work
of
god
generally
of
the
words
he
that
goeth
forth
bearing
precious
seed
shall
doubtless
come
again
rejoicing
bringing
his
sheaves
with
him
perhaps
if
there
were
more
of
that
intense
distress
for
souls
that
leads
to
tears
we
should
more
frequently
see
the
results
we
desire
sometimes
it
may
be
that
while
we
are
complaining
of
the
hardness
of
the
hearts
of
those
we
are
seeking
to
benefit
the
hardness
of
our
own
hearts
and
our
own
feeble
apprehension
of
the
solemn
reality
of
eternal
things
may
be
the
true
cause
of
our
want
of

chapter

voyage
to
china
soon
after
this
the
time
so
long
looked
forward
to
arrived
the
time
that
i
was
to
leave
england
for
china
after
being
set
apart
with
many
prayers
for
the
ministry
of
god
word
among
the
heathen
chinese
i
left
london
for
liverpool
and
on
the
of
september
a
little
service
was
held
in
the
stern
cabin
of
the
which
had
been
secured
for
me
by
the
committee
of
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
under
whose
auspices
i
was
going
to
china
my
beloved
now
sainted
mother
had
come
to
see
me
off
from
liverpool
never
shall
i
forget
that
day
nor
how
she
went
with
me
into
the
little
cabin
that
was
to
be
my
home
for
nearly
six
long
months
with
a
loving
hand
she
smoothed
the
little
bed
she
sat
by
my
side
and
joined
me
in
the
last
hymn
that
we
should
sing
together
before
the
long
parting
we
knelt
down
and
she
prayed
the
last
mother
prayer
i
was
to
hear
before
starting
for
china
then
notice
was
given
that
we
must
separate
and
we
had
to
say
never
expecting
to
meet
on
earth
again
for
my
sake
she
restrained
her
feelings
as
much
as
possible
we
parted
and
she
went
on
shore
giving
me
her
blessing
i
stood
alone
on
deck
and
she
followed
the
ship
as
we
moved
towards
the
dock
gates
as
we
passed
through
the
gates
and
the
separation
really
commenced
i
shall
never
forget
the
cry
of
anguish
wrung
from
that
mother
heart
it
went
through
me
like
a
knife
i
never
knew
so
fully
until
then
what
god
loved
the
world
meant
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
my
precious
mother
learned
more
of
the
love
of
god
to
the
perishing
in
that
hour
than
in
all
her
life
before
oh
how
it
must
grieve
the
heart
of
god
when
he
sees
his
children
indifferent
to
the
needs
of
that
wide
world
for
which
his
beloved
his
only
begotten
son
died
hearken
o
daughter
and
consider
and
incline
thine
ear
forget
also
thine
own
people
and
thy
father
house
so
shall
the
king
desire
thy
beauty
for
he
is
thy
lord
and
worship
thou
him
praise
god
the
number
is
increasing
who
are
finding
out
the
exceeding
joys
the
wondrous
revelations
of
his
mercies
vouchsafed
to
those
who
follow
him
and
emptying
themselves
leave
all
in
obedience
to
his
great
commission
it
was
on
september
that
the
sailed
for
china
and
not
until
march
in
the
spring
of
the
following
year
did
i
arrive
in
shanghai
our
voyage
had
a
rough
beginning
but
many
had
promised
to
remember
us
in
constant
prayer
no
small
comfort
was
this
for
we
had
scarcely
left
the
mersey
when
a
violent
equinoctial
gale
caught
us
and
for
twelve
days
we
were
beating
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
irish
channel
unable
to
get
out
to
sea
the
gale
steadily
increased
and
after
almost
a
week
we
lay
to
for
a
time
but
drifting
on
a
lee
coast
we
were
compelled
again
to
make
sail
and
endeavoured
to
beat
on
to
windward
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
captain
and
crew
however
were
unavailing
and
sunday
night
september
found
us
drifting
into
carnarvon
bay
each
tack
becoming
shorter
until
at
last
we
were
within
a
of
the
rocks
about
this
time
as
the
ship
which
had
refused
to
stay
was
put
round
in
the
other
direction
the
christian
captain
said
to
me
we
can
not
live
half
an
hour
now
what
of
your
call
to
labour
for
the
lord
in
china
i
had
previously
passed
through
a
time
of
much
conflict
but
that
was
over
and
it
was
a
great
joy
to
feel
and
to
tell
him
that
i
would
not
for
any
consideration
be
in
any
other
position
that
i
strongly
expected
to
reach
china
but
that
if
otherwise
at
any
rate
the
master
would
say
it
was
well
that
i
was
found
seeking
to
obey
his
command
within
a
few
minutes
after
wearing
ship
the
captain
walked
up
to
the
compass
and
said
to
me
the
wind
has
freed
two
points
we
shall
be
able
to
beat
out
of
the
bay
and
so
we
did
the
bowsprit
was
sprung
and
the
vessel
seriously
strained
but
in
a
few
days
we
got
out
to
sea
and
the
necessary
repairs
were
so
thoroughly
effected
on
board
that
our
journey
to
china
was
in
due
time
satisfactorily
accomplished
one
thing
was
a
great
trouble
to
me
that
night
i
was
a
very
young
believer
and
had
not
sufficient
faith
in
god
to
see
him
in
and
through
the
use
of
means
i
had
felt
it
a
duty
to
comply
with
the
earnest
wish
of
my
beloved
and
honoured
mother
and
for
her
sake
to
procure
a
but
in
my
own
soul
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
simply
trust
in
god
while
i
had
this
and
my
heart
had
no
rest
until
on
that
night
after
all
hope
of
being
saved
was
gone
i
had
given
it
away
then
i
had
perfect
peace
and
strange
to
say
put
several
light
things
together
likely
to
float
at
the
time
we
struck
without
any
thought
of
inconsistency
or
scruple
ever
since
i
have
seen
clearly
the
mistake
i
made
a
mistake
that
is
very
common
in
these
days
when
erroneous
teaching
on
does
much
harm
misleading
some
as
to
the
purposes
of
god
shaking
the
faith
of
others
and
distressing
the
minds
of
many
the
use
of
means
ought
not
to
lessen
our
faith
in
god
and
our
faith
in
god
ought
not
to
hinder
our
using
whatever
means
he
has
given
us
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
own
purposes
for
years
after
this
i
always
took
a
with
me
and
never
had
any
trouble
about
it
for
after
the
storm
was
over
the
question
was
settled
for
me
through
the
prayerful
study
of
the
scriptures
god
gave
me
then
to
see
my
mistake
probably
to
deliver
me
from
a
great
deal
of
trouble
on
similar
questions
now
so
constantly
raised
when
in
medical
or
surgical
charge
of
any
case
i
have
never
thought
of
neglecting
to
ask
god
guidance
and
blessing
in
the
use
of
appropriate
means
nor
yet
of
omitting
to
give
him
thanks
for
answered
prayer
and
restored
health
but
to
me
it
would
appear
as
presumptuous
and
wrong
to
neglect
the
use
of
those
measures
which
he
himself
has
put
within
our
reach
as
to
neglect
to
take
daily
food
and
suppose
that
life
and
health
might
be
maintained
by
prayer
alone
the
voyage
was
a
very
tedious
one
we
lost
a
good
deal
of
time
on
the
equator
from
calms
and
when
we
finally
reached
the
eastern
archipelago
were
again
detained
from
the
same
cause
usually
a
breeze
would
spring
up
soon
after
sunset
and
last
until
about
dawn
the
utmost
use
was
made
of
it
but
during
the
day
we
lay
still
with
flapping
sails
often
drifting
back
and
losing
a
good
deal
of
the
advantage
we
had
gained
during
the
night
this
happened
notably
on
one
occasion
when
we
were
in
dangerous
proximity
to
the
north
of
new
guinea
saturday
night
had
brought
us
to
a
point
some
thirty
miles
off
the
land
but
during
the
sunday
morning
service
which
was
held
on
deck
i
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
the
captain
looked
troubled
and
frequently
went
over
to
the
side
of
the
ship
when
the
service
was
ended
i
learnt
from
him
the
cause
a
current
was
carrying
us
rapidly
towards
some
sunken
reefs
and
we
were
already
so
near
that
it
seemed
improbable
that
we
should
get
through
the
afternoon
in
safety
after
dinner
the
was
put
out
and
all
hands
endeavoured
without
success
to
turn
the
ship
head
from
the
shore
as
we
drifted
nearer
we
could
plainly
see
the
natives
rushing
about
the
sands
and
lighting
fires
every
here
and
there
the
informed
him
that
these
people
were
cannibals
so
that
our
position
was
not
a
little
alarming
after
standing
together
on
the
deck
for
some
time
in
silence
the
captain
said
to
me
well
we
have
done
everything
that
can
be
done
we
can
only
await
the
result
a
thought
occurred
to
me
and
i
replied
no
there
is
one
thing
we
have
not
done
yet
what
is
it
he
queried
four
of
us
on
board
are
christians
i
answered
the
swedish
carpenter
and
our
coloured
steward
with
the
captain
and
myself
let
us
each
retire
to
his
own
cabin
and
in
agreed
prayer
ask
the
lord
to
give
us
immediately
a
breeze
he
can
as
easily
send
it
now
as
at
sunset
the
captain
complied
with
this
proposal
i
went
and
spoke
to
the
other
two
men
and
after
prayer
with
the
carpenter
we
all
four
retired
to
wait
upon
god
i
had
a
good
but
very
brief
season
in
prayer
and
then
felt
so
satisfied
that
our
request
was
granted
that
i
could
not
continue
asking
and
very
soon
went
up
again
on
deck
the
first
officer
a
godless
man
was
in
charge
i
went
over
and
asked
him
to
let
down
the
clews
or
corners
of
the
mainsail
which
had
been
drawn
up
in
order
to
lessen
the
useless
flapping
of
the
sail
against
the
rigging
he
answered
what
would
be
the
good
of
that
i
told
him
we
had
been
asking
a
wind
from
god
that
it
was
coming
immediately
and
we
were
so
near
the
reef
by
this
time
that
there
was
not
a
minute
to
lose
with
a
look
of
incredulity
and
contempt
he
said
with
an
oath
that
he
would
rather
see
a
wind
than
hear
of
it
but
while
he
was
speaking
i
watched
his
eye
and
followed
it
up
to
the
royal
the
topmost
sail
and
there
sure
enough
the
corner
of
the
sail
was
beginning
to
tremble
in
the
coming
breeze
do
you
see
the
wind
is
coming
look
at
the
royal
i
exclaimed
no
it
is
only
a
he
rejoined
a
mere
puff
of
wind
or
not
i
cried
pray
let
down
the
mainsail
and
let
us
have
the
benefit
this
he
was
not
slow
to
do
in
another
minute
the
heavy
tread
of
the
men
on
the
deck
brought
up
the
captain
from
his
cabin
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
he
saw
that
the
breeze
had
indeed
come
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
ploughing
our
way
at
six
or
seven
knots
an
hour
through
the
water
and
the
multitude
of
naked
savages
whom
we
had
seen
on
the
beach
had
no
wreckage
that
night
we
were
soon
out
of
danger
and
though
the
wind
was
sometimes
unsteady
we
did
not
altogether
lose
it
until
after
passing
the
pelew
islands
thus
god
encouraged
me
ere
landing
on
china
shores
to
bring
every
variety
of
need
to
him
in
prayer
and
expect
that
he
would
honour
the
of
the
lord
jesus
and
give
the
help
which
each
emergency
required

chapter
ix
early
missionary
experiences
on
landing
in
shanghai
on
march
i
found
myself
surrounded
with
difficulties
that
were
wholly
unexpected
a
band
of
rebels
known
as
the
red
turbans
had
taken
possession
of
the
native
city
against
which
was
encamped
an
imperial
army
of
from
forty
to
fifty
thousand
men
who
were
a
much
greater
source
of
discomfort
and
danger
to
the
little
european
community
than
were
the
rebels
themselves
upon
landing
i
was
told
that
to
live
outside
the
settlement
was
impossible
while
within
the
foreign
concession
apartments
were
scarcely
obtainable
at
any
price
the
dollar
now
worth
about
three
shillings
had
risen
to
a
value
of
and
the
prospect
for
one
with
only
a
small
income
of
english
money
was
dark
indeed
however
i
had
three
letters
of
introduction
and
counted
on
counsel
and
help
especially
from
one
of
those
to
whom
i
had
been
commended
whose
friends
i
well
knew
and
highly
valued
of
course
i
sought
him
out
at
once
but
only
to
learn
that
he
had
been
buried
a
month
or
two
before
having
died
from
fever
during
the
time
of
my
voyage
saddened
by
these
tidings
i
inquired
for
a
missionary
to
whom
another
of
my
letters
of
introduction
was
addressed
but
a
further
disappointment
awaited
me
he
had
left
for
america
the
third
letter
remained
but
as
it
had
been
given
by
a
comparative
stranger
i
had
expected
less
from
it
than
from
the
other
two
it
proved
however
to
be
god
channel
of
help
the
rev
medhurst
of
the
london
mission
to
whom
it
was
addressed
introduced
me
to
lockhart
who
kindly
allowed
me
to
live
with
him
for
six
months
medhurst
procured
my
first
chinese
teacher
and
he
edkins
and
the
late
alexander
wylie
gave
me
considerable
help
with
the
language
those
were
indeed
troublous
times
and
times
of
danger
coming
out
of
the
city
one
day
with
wylie
he
entered
into
conversation
with
two
coolies
while
we
waited
a
little
while
at
the
east
gate
for
a
companion
who
was
behind
us
before
our
companion
came
up
an
attack
upon
the
city
from
the
batteries
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
commenced
which
caused
us
to
hurry
away
to
a
place
of
less
danger
the
whiz
of
the
balls
being
unpleasantly
near
the
coolies
unfortunately
stayed
too
long
and
were
wounded
on
reaching
the
settlement
we
stopped
a
few
minutes
to
make
a
purchase
and
then
proceeded
at
once
to
the
london
mission
compound
where
at
the
door
of
the
hospital
we
found
the
two
poor
coolies
with
whom
wylie
had
conversed
their
four
ankles
terribly
shattered
by
a
cannon
ball
the
poor
fellows
declined
amputation
and
both
died
we
felt
how
narrow
had
been
our
escape
at
another
time
early
in
the
morning
i
had
joined
one
of
the
missionaries
on
his
verandah
to
watch
the
battle
proceeding
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
of
a
mile
when
suddenly
a
spent
ball
passed
between
us
and
buried
itself
in
the
verandah
wall
another
day
my
friend
wylie
left
a
book
on
the
table
after
luncheon
and
returning
for
it
about
five
minutes
later
found
the
arm
of
the
chair
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
shot
clean
away
but
in
the
midst
of
these
and
many
other
dangers
god
protected
us
after
six
months
stay
with
lockhart
i
rented
a
native
house
outside
the
settlement
and
commenced
a
little
missionary
work
amongst
my
chinese
neighbours
which
for
a
few
months
continued
practicable
when
the
french
joined
the
imperialists
in
attacking
the
city
the
position
of
my
house
became
so
dangerous
that
during
the
last
few
weeks
in
consequence
of
nightly
recurring
skirmishes
i
gave
up
attempting
to
sleep
except
in
the
daytime
one
night
a
fire
appeared
very
near
and
i
climbed
up
to
a
little
observatory
i
had
arranged
on
the
roof
of
the
house
to
see
whether
it
was
necessary
to
attempt
escape
while
there
a
ball
struck
the
ridge
of
the
roof
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
quadrangle
showering
pieces
of
broken
tile
all
around
me
while
the
ball
itself
rolled
down
into
the
court
below
it
weighed
four
or
five
pounds
and
had
it
come
a
few
inches
higher
would
probably
have
spent
its
force
on
me
instead
of
on
the
building
my
dear
mother
kept
the
ball
for
many
years
shortly
after
this
i
had
to
abandon
the
house
and
return
to
the
foreign
settlement
a
step
that
was
taken
none
too
soon
for
before
the
last
of
my
belongings
were
removed
the
house
was
burnt
to
the
ground
of
the
trials
of
this
early
period
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
convey
any
adequate
idea
to
one
of
a
sensitive
nature
the
horrors
atrocities
and
misery
connected
with
war
were
a
terrible
ordeal
the
embarrassment
also
of
the
times
was
considerable
with
an
income
of
only
eighty
pounds
a
year
i
was
compelled
upon
moving
into
the
settlement
to
give
one
hundred
and
twenty
for
rent
and
sublet
half
the
house
and
though
the
committee
of
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
increased
my
income
when
after
the
arrival
of
parker
they
learned
more
of
our
circumstances
many
painful
experiences
had
necessarily
been
passed
through
few
can
realise
how
distressing
to
so
young
and
untried
a
worker
these
difficulties
seemed
or
the
intense
loneliness
of
the
position
of
a
pioneer
who
could
not
even
hint
at
many
of
his
circumstances
as
to
do
so
would
have
been
a
tacit
appeal
for
help
the
great
enemy
is
always
ready
with
his
suggestion
all
these
things
are
against
me
but
oh
how
false
the
word
the
cold
and
even
the
hunger
the
watchings
and
sleeplessness
of
nights
of
danger
and
the
feeling
at
times
of
utter
isolation
and
helplessness
were
well
and
wisely
chosen
and
tenderly
and
lovingly
meted
out
what
circumstances
could
have
rendered
the
word
of
god
more
sweet
the
presence
of
god
more
real
the
help
of
god
more
precious
they
were
times
indeed
of
emptying
and
humbling
but
were
experiences
that
made
not
ashamed
and
that
strengthened
purpose
to
go
forward
as
god
might
direct
with
his
promise
i
will
not
fail
thee
nor
forsake
thee
one
can
see
even
now
that
as
for
god
his
way
is
perfect
and
yet
can
rejoice
that
the
missionary
path
of
is
comparatively
a
smooth
and
an
easy

journeying
inland
was
contrary
to
treaty
arrangements
and
attended
with
much
difficulty
especially
for
some
time
after
the
battle
of
muddy
flat
in
which
an
contingent
of
about
three
hundred
marines
and
seamen
with
a
volunteer
corps
of
less
than
a
hundred
residents
attacked
the
imperial
camp
and
drove
away
from
thirty
to
fifty
thousand
chinese
soldiers

range

and

thirty
miles
to

is
situated
the
influential

we
spent
some
time
in
evangelising
on
those
islands
and
then
proceeded
to
where
we
preached
and
gave
books
to
thousands
of
the
devotees
who
were
attending
an
idolatrous
festival
from
thence
we
went
on
to
and

our
painful
experiences
there
the
following
journal
will
tell
april
after
breakfast
we
commended
ourselves
to
the
care
of
our
heavenly
father
and
sought
his
blessing
before
proceeding
to
this
great
city
the
day
was
dull
and
wet
we
felt
persuaded
that
satan
would
not
allow
us
to
assail
his
kingdom
as
we
were
attempting
to
do
without
raising
serious
opposition
but
we
were
also
fully
assured
that
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
we
should
preach
christ
in
this
city
and
distribute
the
word
of
truth
among
its
people
we
were
sorry
that
we
had
but
few
books
left
for
such
an
important
place
the
result
however
proved
that
this
also
was
providential
our
native
teachers
did
their
best
to
persuade
us
not
to
go
into
the
city
but
we
determined
that
by
god
help
nothing
should
hinder
us
we
directed
them
however
to
remain
in
one
of
the
boats
and
if
we
did
not
return
to
learn
whatever
they
could
respecting
our
fate
and
make
all
possible
haste
to
shanghai
with
the
information
we
also
arranged
that
the
other
boat
should
wait
for
us
even
if
we
could
not
get
back
that
night
so
that
we
might
not
be
detained
for
want
of
a
boat
in
case
of
returning
later
we
then
put
our
books
into
two
bags
and
with
a
servant
who
always
accompanied
us
on
these
occasions
set
off
for
the
city
distant
about
seven
miles
walking
was
out
of
the
question
from
the
state
of
the
roads
so
we
availed
ourselves
of
the
only
conveyance
to
be
had
in
these
parts
a
is
cheaper
than
a
sedan
only
requiring
one
coolie
but
is
by
no
means
an
agreeable
conveyance
on
rough
dirty
roads
we
had
not
gone
far
before
the
servant
requested
permission
to
go
back
as
he
was
thoroughly
frightened
by
reports
concerning
the
native
soldiery
of
course
we
at
once
consented
not
wishing
to
involve
another
in
trouble
and
determined
to
carry
the
books
ourselves
and
look
for
physical
as
well
as
spiritual
strength
to
him
who
had
promised
to
supply
all
our
need
at
this
point
a
respectable
man
came
up
and
earnestly
warned
us
against
proceeding
saying
that
if
we
did
we
should
find
to
our
sorrow
what
the
militia
were
like
we
thanked
him
for
his
kindly
counsel
but
could
not
act
upon
it
as
our
hearts
were
fixed
whether
it
were
to
bonds
imprisonment
and
death
or
whether
to
distribute
our
scriptures
and
tracts
in
safety
and
return
unhurt
we
knew
not
but
we
were
determined
by
the
grace
of
god
not
to
leave
any
longer
without
the
gospel
nor
its
teeming
thousands
to
die
in
ignorance
of
the
way
of
life
after
this
my
man
would
proceed
no
farther
and
i
had
to
seek
another
who
was
fortunately
not
difficult
to
find
as
we
went
on
the
ride
in
the
mud
and
rain
was
anything
but
agreeable
and
we
could
not
help
feeling
the
danger
of
our
position
although
wavering
not
for
a
moment
at
intervals
we
encouraged
one
another
with
promises
from
the
scripture
and
verses
of
hymns
that
verse
the
perils
of
the
sea
the
perils
of
the
land
should
not
dishearten
thee
thy
lord
is
nigh
at
hand
but
should
thy
courage
fail
when
tried
and
sore
oppressed
his
promise
shall
avail
and
set
thy
soul
at
rest
seemed
particularly
appropriate
to
our
circumstances
and
was
very
comforting
to
me
on
our
way
we
passed
through
one
small
town
of
about
a
thousand
inhabitants
and
here
in
the
mandarin
dialect
i
preached
jesus
to
a
good
number
of
people
never
was
i
so
happy
in
speaking
of
the
love
of
god
and
the
atonement
of
jesus
christ
my
own
soul
was
richly
blessed
and
filled
with
joy
and
peace
and
i
was
able
to
speak
with
unusual
freedom
and
ease
and
how
rejoiced
i
was
when
afterwards
i
heard
one
of
our
hearers
repeating
to
the
newcomers
in
his
own
local
dialect
the
truths
upon
which
i
had
been
dwelling
oh
how
thankful
i
felt
to
hear
a
chinaman
of
his
own
accord
telling
his
that
god
loved
them
that
they
were
sinners
but
that
jesus
died
instead
of
them
and
paid
the
penalty
of
their
guilt
that
one
moment
repaid
me
for
all
the
trials
we
had
passed
through
and
i
felt
that
if
the
lord
should
grant
his
holy
spirit
to
change
the
heart
of
that
man
we
had
not
come
in
vain
we
distributed
a
few
testaments
and
tracts
for
the
people
were
able
to
read
and
we
could
not
leave
them
without
the
gospel
it
was
well
that
we
did
so
for
when
we
reached
we
found
we
had
quite
as
many
left
as
we
had
strength
to
carry
nearing
the
end
of
our
journey
as
we
approached
the
western
suburb
of
the
city
the
prayer
of
the
early
christians
when
persecution
was
commencing
came
to
my
mind
and
now
lord
behold
their
threatenings
and
grant
unto
thy
servants
that
with
all
boldness
they
may
speak
thy
word
in
this
petition
we
most
heartily
united
before
entering
the
suburb
we
laid
our
plans
so
as
to
act
in
concert
and
told
our
men
where
to
await
us
that
they
might
not
be
involved
in
any
trouble
on
our
account
then
looking
up
to
our
heavenly
father
we
committed
ourselves
to
his
keeping
took
our
books
and
set
on
for
the
city
for
some
distance
we
walked
along
the
principal
street
of
the
suburb
leading
to
the
west
gate
unmolested
and
were
amused
at
the
unusual
title
of
black
devils
which
was
applied
to
us
we
wondered
about
it
at
the
time
but
afterwards
found
that
it
was
our
clothes
and
not
our
skin
that
gave
rise
to
it
as
we
passed
several
of
the
soldiers
i
remarked
to
burdon
that
these
were
the
men
we
had
heard
so
much
about
and
that
they
seemed
willing
to
receive
us
quietly
enough
long
before
we
reached
the
gate
however
a
tall
powerful
man
made
tenfold
fiercer
by
partial
intoxication
let
us
know
that
all
the
militia
were
not
so
peaceably
inclined
by
seizing
burdon
by
the
shoulders
my
companion
endeavoured
to
shake
him
off
i
turned
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
at
once
we
were
surrounded
by
a
dozen
or
more
brutal
men
who
hurried
us
on
to
the
city
at
a
fearful
pace
my
bag
now
began
to
feel
very
heavy
and
i
could
not
change
hands
to
relieve
myself
i
was
soon
in
a
profuse
perspiration
and
was
scarcely
able
to
keep
pace
with
them
we
demanded
to
be
taken
before
the
chief
magistrate
but
were
told
that
they
knew
where
to
take
us
and
what
to
do
with
such
persons
as
we
were
with
the
most
insulting
epithets
the
man
who
first
seized
burdon
soon
afterwards
left
him
for
me
and
became
my
principal
tormentor
for
i
was
neither
so
tall
nor
so
strong
as
my
friend
and
was
therefore
less
able
to
resist
him
he
all
but
knocked
me
down
again
and
again
seized
me
by
the
hair
took
hold
of
my
collar
so
as
to
almost
choke
me
and
grasped
my
arms
and
shoulders
making
them
black
and
blue
had
this
treatment
continued
much
longer
i
must
have
fainted
all
but
exhausted
how
refreshing
was
the
remembrance
of
a
verse
quoted
by
my
dear
mother
in
one
of
my
last
home
letters
we
speak
of
the
realms
of
the
blest
that
country
so
bright
and
so
fair
and
oft
are
its
glories
confessed
but
what
must
it
be
to
be
there
to
be
absent
from
the
body
to
be
present
with
the
lord
to
be
free
from
sin
and
this
is
the
end
of
the
worst
that
man
malice
can
ever
bring
upon
us
as
we
were
walking
along
burdon
tried
to
give
away
a
few
books
that
he
was
carrying
not
knowing
whether
we
might
have
another
opportunity
of
doing
so
but
the
fearful
rage
of
the
soldier
and
the
way
he
insisted
on
manacles
being
brought
which
fortunately
were
not
at
hand
convinced
us
that
in
our
present
position
we
could
do
no
good
in
attempting
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
quietly
to
submit
and
go
along
with
our
captors
once
or
twice
a
quarrel
arose
as
to
how
we
should
be
dealt
with
the
more
mild
of
our
conductors
saying
that
we
ought
to
be
taken
to
the
magistrate
office
but
others
wishing
to
kill
us
at
once
without
appeal
to
any
authority
our
minds
were
kept
in
perfect
peace
and
when
thrown
together
on
one
of
these
occasions
we
reminded
each
other
that
the
apostles
rejoiced
that
they
were
counted
to
suffer
in
the
cause
of
christ
having
succeeded
in
getting
my
hand
into
my
pocket
i
produced
a
chinese
card
if
the
large
red
paper
bearing
one
name
may
be
so
called
and
after
this
was
treated
with
more
respect
i
demanded
it
should
be
given
to
the
chief
official
of
the
place
and
that
we
should
be
led
to
his
office
before
this
we
had
been
unable
say
what
we
would
to
persuade
them
that
we
were
foreigners
although
we
were
both
in
english
attire
oh
the
long
weary
streets
that
we
were
dragged
through
i
thought
they
would
never
end
and
seldom
have
i
felt
more
thankful
than
when
we
stopped
at
a
place
where
we
were
told
a
mandarin
resided
quite
exhausted
bathed
in
perspiration
and
with
my
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
i
leaned
against
the
wall
and
saw
that
burdon
was
in
much
the
same
condition
i
requested
them
to
bring
us
chairs
but
they
told
us
to
wait
and
when
i
begged
them
to
give
us
some
tea
received
only
the
same
answer
round
the
doorway
a
large
crowd
had
gathered
and
burdon
collecting
his
remaining
strength
preached
christ
jesus
to
them
our
cards
and
books
had
been
taken
in
to
the
mandarin
but
he
proved
to
be
one
of
low
rank
and
after
keeping
us
waiting
for
some
time
he
referred
us
to
his
superiors
in
office
upon
hearing
this
and
finding
that
it
was
their
purpose
to
turn
us
out
again
into
the
crowded
streets
we
positively
refused
to
move
a
single
step
and
insisted
on
chairs
being
brought
after
some
demur
this
was
done
we
seated
ourselves
in
them
and
were
carried
on
on
the
road
we
felt
so
glad
of
the
rest
which
the
chairs
afforded
us
and
so
thankful
at
having
been
able
to
preach
jesus
in
spite
of
satan
malice
that
our
joy
was
depicted
on
our
countenances
and
as
we
passed
along
we
heard
some
say
that
we
did
not
look
like
bad
men
while
others
seemed
to
pity
us
when
we
arrived
at
the
magistrate
office
i
wondered
where
we
were
being
taken
for
though
we
passed
through
some
great
gates
that
looked
like
those
of
the
city
wall
we
were
still
evidently
within
the
city
a
second
pair
of
gates
suggested
the
idea
that
it
was
a
prison
into
which
we
were
being
carried
but
when
we
came
in
sight
of
a
large
tablet
with
the
inscription
chï
fu
the
father
and
mother
of
the
people
we
felt
that
we
had
been
conveyed
to
the
right
place
this
being
the
title
assumed
by
the
mandarins
our
cards
were
again
sent
in
and
after
a
short
delay
we
were
taken
into
the
presence
of
ta
the
great
venerable
father
who
as
it
proved
had
formerly
been
of
shanghai
and
consequently
knew
the
importance
of
treating
foreigners
with
courtesy
coming
before
him
some
of
the
people
fell
on
their
knees
and
bowed
down
to
the
ground
and
my
conductor
motioned
for
me
to
do
the
same
but
without
success
this
mandarin
who
seemed
to
be
the
highest
authority
of
and
wore
an
opaque
blue
button
on
his
cap
came
out
to
meet
us
and
treated
us
with
every
possible
token
of
respect
he
took
us
to
an
inner
apartment
a
more
private
room
but
was
followed
by
a
large
number
of
writers
runners
and
other
i
related
the
object
of
our
visit
and
begged
permission
to
give
him
copies
of
our
books
and
tracts
for
which
he
thanked
me
as
i
handed
him
a
copy
of
the
new
testament
with
part
of
the
old
from
genesis
to
ruth
and
some
tracts
i
tried
to
explain
a
little
about
them
and
also
to
give
him
a
brief
summary
of
our
teachings
he
listened
very
attentively
as
of
course
did
all
the
others
present
he
then
ordered
some
refreshments
to
be
brought
in
which
were
very
welcome
and
himself
partook
of
them
with
us
after
a
long
stay
we
asked
permission
to
see
something
of
the
city
and
to
distribute
the
books
we
had
brought
before
our
return
to
this
he
kindly
consented
we
then
mentioned
that
we
had
been
most
disrespectfully
treated
as
we
came
in
but
that
we
did
not
attach
much
importance
to
the
fact
being
aware
that
the
soldiers
knew
no
better
not
desiring
however
to
have
such
an
experience
repeated
we
requested
him
to
give
orders
that
we
were
not
to
be
further
molested
this
also
he
promised
to
do
and
with
every
possible
token
of
respect
accompanied
us
to
the
door
of
his
official
residence
sending
several
runners
to
see
that
we
were
respectfully
treated
we
distributed
our
books
well
and
quickly
and
left
the
city
quite
in
state
it
was
amusing
to
us
to
see
the
way
in
which
the
runners
made
use
of
their
tails
when
the
street
was
blocked
by
the
crowd
they
turned
them
into
whips
and
laid
them
about
the
people
shoulders
to
right
and
left
we
had
a
little
trouble
in
finding
our
but
eventually
succeeding
we
paid
off
the
chair
coolies
mounted
our
humble
vehicles
and
returned
to
the
river
accompanied
for
fully
half
the
distance
by
an
attendant
from
the
magistrate
office
early
in
the
evening
we
got
back
to
the
boats
in
safety
sincerely
thankful
to
our
heavenly
father
for
his
gracious
protection
and
aid
illustration
chapter
xi
with
the
rev
william
burns
after
the
retaking
of
shanghai
by
the
imperialists
in
february
i
was
enabled
to
rent
a
house
within
the
walls
of
the
native
city
and
gladly
availed
myself
of
this
opportunity
to
reside
amidst
the
crowded
population
left
to
inhabit
the
ruins
that
had
survived
the
war
here
i
made
my
headquarters
though
often
absent
on
more
or
less
prolonged
itinerations
at
the
suggestion
of
the
rev
medhurst
the
veteran
leader
of
the
london
mission
i
was
led
at
about
this
period
to
adopt
the
native
costume
in
preference
to
foreign
dress
to
facilitate
travel
and
residence
inland
the
chinese
had
permitted
a
foreign
firm
to
build
a
silk
factory
some
distance
inland
with
the
proviso
that
the
style
of
building
must
be
purely
chinese
and
that
there
should
be
nothing
external
to
suggest
that
it
was
foreign
much
benefit
was
found
to
result
from
this
change
of
costume
and
i
and
most
of
those
associated
with
me
have
continued
to
use
native
dress
the
rebellion
commenced
in
had
by
this
time
reached
the
height
of
its
ephemeral
success
the
great
city
of
had
fallen
before
the
invading
host
and
there
within
two
hundred
miles
of
shanghai
the
rebels
had
established
their
headquarters
and
proceeded
to
fortify
themselves
for
further
conquests
during
the
summer
of
various
attempts
were
made
to
visit
the
leaders
of
the
movement
in
order
to
bring
to
bear
some
decidedly
christian
influence
upon
them
but
so
little
success
was
met
with
that
these
efforts
were
abandoned
i
amongst
others
had
sought
to
reach
but
finding
it
impossible
to
do
so
turned
my
attention
again
to
evangelistic
work
on
the
island
of
after
some
time
i
was
enabled
so
far
to
overcome
the
prejudice
and
fears
of
the
people
as
to
rent
a
little
house
and
settle
down
in
their
midst
this
was
a
great
joy
and
encouragement
to
me
but
before
many
weeks
were
over
complaints
were
made
by
the
local
authorities
to
the
british
consul
who
compelled
me
to
retire
though
the
french
consul
had
himself
secured
to
the
romish
missionaries
a
property
within
three
or
four
miles
of
the
house
i
had
to
vacate
sorely
tried
and
disappointed
by
this
unexpected
hindrance
i
reluctantly
returned
to
shanghai
little
dreaming
of
the
blessing
that
god
had
in
store
for
me
there
a
few
months
previously
the
rev
william
burns
of
the
english
presbyterian
mission
had
arrived
in
that
port
on
his
return
journey
from
home
and
before
proceeding
to
his
former
sphere
of
service
in
the
southern
province
of
he
had
endeavoured
like
myself
without
success
to
visit
the
rebels
at
failing
in
this
attempt
he
made
his
headquarters
in
shanghai
for
a
season
devoting
himself
to
the
evangelisation
of
the
surrounding
populous
regions
thus
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
i
was
providentially
led
into
association
with
this
beloved
and
honoured
servant
of
god
we
journeyed
together
evangelising
cities
and
towns
in
southern
and
north
living
in
our
boats
and
following
the
course
of
the
canals
and
rivers
which
here
spread
like
a
network
over
the
whole
face
of
the
rich
and
fertile
country
burns
at
that
time
was
wearing
english
dress
but
saw
that
while
i
was
the
younger
and
in
every
way
less
experienced
i
had
the
quiet
hearers
while
he
was
followed
by
the
rude
boys
and
by
the
curious
but
careless
that
i
was
invited
to
the
homes
of
the
people
while
he
received
an
apology
that
the
crowd
that
would
follow
precluded
his
being
invited
after
some
weeks
of
observation
he
also
adopted
the
native
dress
and
enjoyed
the
increased
facilities
which
it
gave
those
happy
months
were
an
unspeakable
joy
and
privilege
to
me
his
love
for
the
word
was
delightful
and
his
holy
reverential
life
and
constant
communings
with
god
made
fellowship
with
him
satisfying
to
the
deep
cravings
of
my
heart
his
accounts
of
revival
work
and
of
persecutions
in
canada
and
dublin
and
in
southern
china
were
most
instructive
as
well
as
interesting
for
with
true
spiritual
insight
he
often
pointed
out
god
purposes
in
trial
in
a
way
that
made
all
life
assume
quite
a
new
aspect
and
value
his
views
especially
about
evangelism
as
the
great
work
of
the
church
and
the
order
of
lay
evangelists
as
a
lost
order
that
scripture
required
to
be
restored
were
which
were
to
prove
fruitful
in
the
subsequent
organisation
of
the
china
inland
mission
externally
however
our
path
was
not
always
a
smooth
one
but
when
permitted
to
stay
for
any
length
of
time
in
town
or
city
the
opportunity
was
well
utilised
we
were
in
the
habit
of
leaving
our
boats
after
prayer
for
blessing
at
about
nine
in
the
morning
with
a
light
bamboo
stool
in
hand
selecting
a
suitable
station
one
would
mount
the
stool
and
speak
for
twenty
minutes
while
the
other
was
pleading
for
blessing
and
then
changing
places
the
voice
of
the
first
speaker
had
a
rest
after
an
hour
or
two
thus
occupied
we
would
move
on
to
another
point
at
some
distance
from
the
first
and
speak
again
usually
about
midday
we
returned
to
our
boats
for
dinner
fellowship
and
prayer
and
then
resumed
our
work
until
dusk
after
tea
and
further
rest
we
would
go
with
our
native
helpers
to
some
where
several
hours
might
be
spent
in
free
conversation
with
the
people
not
infrequently
before
leaving
a
town
we
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
much
truth
had
been
grasped
and
we
placed
many
scriptures
and
books
in
the
hands
of
those
interested
the
following
letter
was
written
by
burns
to
his
mother
at
home
in
scotland
about
this
time
miles
from
shanghai
taking
advantage
of
a
rainy
day
which
confines
me
to
my
boat
i
pen
a
few
lines
in
addition
to
a
letter
to
dundee
containing
particulars
which
i
need
not
repeat
it
is
now
days
since
i
left
shanghai
on
this
last
occasion
a
young
english
missionary
taylor
of
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
has
been
my
companion
during
these
weeks
he
in
his
boat
and
i
in
mine
and
we
have
experienced
much
mercy
and
on
some
occasions
considerable
assistance
in
our
work
i
must
once
more
tell
the
story
i
have
had
to
tell
already
more
than
once
how
four
weeks
ago
on
december
i
put
on
the
chinese
dress
which
i
am
now
wearing
taylor
had
made
this
change
a
few
months
before
and
i
found
that
he
was
in
consequence
so
much
less
incommoded
in
preaching
by
the
crowd
that
i
concluded
it
was
my
duty
to
follow
his
example
we
were
at
that
time
more
than
double
the
distance
from
shanghai
that
we
are
now
and
would
still
have
been
at
as
great
a
distance
had
we
not
met
at
one
place
with
a
band
of
lawless
people
who
demanded
money
and
threatened
to
break
our
boats
if
their
demands
were
refused
the
boatmen
were
very
much
alarmed
and
insisted
on
returning
to
some
place
nearer
home
these
people
had
previously
broken
in
violently
a
part
of
taylor
boat
because
their
unreasonable
demand
for
books
was
not
complied
with
we
have
a
large
very
large
field
of
labour
in
this
region
though
it
might
be
difficult
in
the
meantime
for
one
to
establish
himself
in
any
particular
place
the
people
listen
with
attention
but
we
need
the
power
from
on
high
to
convince
and
convert
is
there
any
spirit
of
prayer
on
our
behalf
among
god
people
in
kilsyth
or
is
there
any
effort
to
seek
this
spirit
how
great
the
need
is
and
how
great
the
arguments
and
motives
for
prayer
in
this
case
the
harvest
here
is
indeed
great
and
the
labourers
are
few
and
imperfectly
fitted
without
much
grace
for
such
a
work
and
yet
grace
can
make
the
few
and
feeble
instruments
the
means
of
accomplishing
great
things
things
greater
than
we
can
even
conceive
the
incident
referred
to
in
this
letter
which
led
to
our
return
to
shanghai
more
speedily
than
we
had
at
first
intended
took
place
on
the
northern
border
of
we
had
reached
a
busy
market
town
known
by
the
name
of
or
black
town
the
inhabitants
of
which
we
had
been
told
were
the
wildest
and
most
lawless
people
in
that
part
of
the
country
such
indeed
we
found
them
to
be
the
town
was
a
refuge
for
salt
smugglers
and
other
bad
characters
the
following
extracts
are
taken
from
my
journal
written
at
the
time
commenced
our
work
in
this
morning
by
distributing
a
large
number
of
tracts
and
some
testaments
the
people
seemed
much
surprised
and
we
could
not
learn
that
any
foreigner
had
been
here
before
we
preached
twice
once
in
the
temple
of
the
god
of
war
and
afterwards
in
an
empty
space
left
by
a
fire
which
had
completely
destroyed
many
houses
in
the
afternoon
we
preached
again
to
a
large
and
attentive
audience
on
the
same
site
and
in
the
evening
adjourned
to
a
where
we
had
a
good
opportunity
of
speaking
until
it
got
noised
abroad
that
we
were
there
when
too
many
people
coming
in
we
were
obliged
to
leave
our
native
assistants
tsien
and
were
able
however
to
remain
returning
to
our
boats
we
spoke
to
a
number
of
people
standing
on
a
bridge
and
felt
we
had
abundant
reason
to
be
thankful
and
encouraged
by
the
result
of
our
first
day
labour
first
sent
tsien
and
to
distribute
some
sheet
tracts
after
their
return
we
went
with
them
and
in
a
space
cleared
by
fire
we
separated
and
addressed
two
audiences
on
our
return
to
the
boats
for
lunch
we
found
people
waiting
as
usual
and
desiring
books
some
were
distributed
to
those
who
were
able
to
read
them
and
then
asking
them
kindly
to
excuse
us
while
we
took
our
midday
meal
i
went
into
my
boat
and
shut
the
door
hardly
was
there
time
to
pour
out
a
cup
of
tea
when
a
battering
began
and
the
roof
was
at
once
broken
in
i
went
out
at
the
back
and
found
four
or
five
men
taking
the
large
lumps
of
frozen
earth
turned
up
in
a
field
close
by
weighing
i
should
suppose
from
seven
to
fourteen
pounds
each
and
throwing
them
at
the
boat
remonstrance
was
of
no
avail
and
it
was
not
long
ere
a
considerable
part
of
the
upper
structure
of
the
boat
was
broken
to
pieces
and
a
quantity
of
earth
covered
the
things
inside
finally
tsien
got
a
boat
that
was
passing
to
land
him
at
a
short
distance
and
by
a
few
tracts
drew
away
the
attention
of
the
men
thus
ending
the
assault
we
now
learned
that
of
those
who
had
done
the
mischief
only
two
were
natives
of
the
place
the
others
being
salt
smugglers
and
that
the
cause
was
our
not
having
satisfied
their
unreasonable
demand
for
books
most
providentially
no
one
was
injured
and
as
soon
as
quiet
was
somewhat
restored
we
all
met
in
burns
boat
and
joined
in
thanksgiving
that
we
had
been
preserved
from
personal
harm
praying
also
for
the
perpetrators
of
the
mischief
and
that
it
might
be
for
good
to
us
and
to
those
with
us
we
then
took
our
lunch
and
went
on
shore
and
but
a
few
steps
from
the
boats
addressed
a
large
multitude
that
soon
assembled
we
were
specially
assisted
never
were
we
heard
with
more
attention
and
not
one
voice
was
found
to
sympathise
with
the
men
who
had
molested
us
in
the
evening
at
the
the
same
spirit
was
manifested
and
some
seemed
to
hear
with
joy
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
through
a
crucified
and
risen
saviour
as
we
came
home
we
passed
a
barber
shop
still
open
and
i
went
in
and
while
getting
my
head
shaved
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
a
few
people
and
afterwards
pasted
a
couple
of
sheet
tracts
on
the
wall
for
the
benefit
of
future
customers
a
respectable
of
the
name
of
yao
who
on
the
first
or
second
day
of
our
stay
at
had
received
portions
of
the
new
testament
and
a
tract
came
yesterday
when
our
boat
was
broken
to
beg
for
some
more
books
at
that
time
we
were
all
in
confusion
from
the
damage
done
and
from
the
earth
thrown
into
the
boat
and
so
invited
him
to
come
again
in
a
day
or
two
time
when
we
would
gladly
supply
him
this
morning
he
appeared
and
handed
in
the
following
note
on
a
former
day
i
begged
burns
and
taylor
the
two
to
give
me
good
books
it
happened
at
that
time
those
of
our
town
whose
hearts
were
deceived
by
not
knowing
the
of
went
so
far
as
to
dare
to
and
and
injure
your
respected
boat
i
thank
you
for
promising
afterwards
to
give
the
books
and
beg
the
following
complete
new
testament
of
a
good
man
when
near
his
death
christian
doctrines
an
almanack
of
christianity
to
make
the
world
happy
of
each
one
copy
sung
and
tsien
and
all
teachers
i
hope
are
well
further
compliments
are
unwritten
this
note
is
interesting
as
showing
that
he
had
been
reading
the
new
testament
attentively
as
the
italicised
words
were
all
taken
from
it
his
use
of
raca
and
moreh
for
reviling
shows
their
meaning
was
not
lost
upon
him
after
supplying
this
man
we
went
out
with
tsien
and
to
the
east
of
the
town
and
spoke
in
the
street
for
a
short
time
upon
returning
to
the
boats
i
was
visited
by
two
men
who
are
in
the
magistrate
office
here
i
was
greatly
helped
in
speaking
to
them
of
a
crucified
saviour
in
the
mandarin
dialect
and
though
one
of
them
did
not
pay
much
attention
the
other
did
and
made
inquiries
that
showed
the
interest
he
was
feeling
when
they
had
left
i
went
on
shore
and
spoke
to
the
people
collected
there
to
whom
had
been
preaching
the
setting
sun
afforded
a
parable
and
reminded
one
of
the
words
of
jesus
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
and
as
i
spoke
of
the
uncertain
duration
of
this
life
and
of
our
ignorance
as
to
the
time
of
christ
return
a
degree
of
deep
seriousness
prevailed
that
i
had
never
previously
witnessed
in
china
i
engaged
in
prayer
and
the
greatest
decorum
was
observed
i
then
returned
to
my
boat
with
a
buddhist
priest
who
had
been
in
the
audience
and
he
admitted
that
buddhism
was
a
system
of
deceit
that
could
give
no
hope
in
death
in
the
afternoon
we
addressed
the
people
on
shore
close
to
our
boats
also
in
one
of
the
streets
of
the
city
and
in
a
books
being
distributed
on
each
occasion
in
the
evening
we
went
as
usual
to
speak
in
the
but
determined
to
go
to
the
opposite
end
of
the
town
in
order
to
afford
those
who
lived
there
a
better
opportunity
of
meeting
with
us
it
was
a
long
straggling
place
nearly
two
english
miles
in
length
as
burns
and
i
were
accustomed
to
talk
together
in
chinese
this
conclusion
was
known
to
those
in
the
boats
after
we
had
proceeded
a
short
distance
we
changed
our
minds
and
went
instead
to
the
usual
thinking
that
persons
might
have
gone
there
expecting
to
meet
us
but
this
was
not
the
case
and
we
did
not
find
such
serious
hearers
as
we
had
done
on
previous
occasions
on
this
account
burns
proposed
leaving
earlier
than
usual
and
we
did
so
telling
tsien
and
that
they
might
remain
a
little
longer
returning
to
the
boats
we
gave
away
a
few
books
but
singularly
enough
were
left
to
go
alone
no
one
accompanying
us
as
is
so
generally
the
case
instead
of
being
a
clear
night
as
it
was
when
we
started
we
found
that
it
had
become
intensely
dark
on
our
way
we
met
the
boatman
whose
manner
seemed
very
strange
and
without
giving
us
any
explanation
he
blew
out
the
candle
of
our
lantern
we
relighted
the
lantern
telling
him
not
to
put
it
out
again
when
to
our
surprise
he
deliberately
removed
the
candle
and
threw
it
into
the
canal
he
then
walked
down
along
a
low
wall
jutting
out
to
the
river
edge
and
gazed
into
the
water
not
knowing
what
was
the
matter
with
him
i
ran
forward
to
hold
him
fearful
lest
he
were
going
to
drown
himself
but
to
my
great
relief
he
came
quietly
back
in
answer
to
our
repeated
questions
he
told
us
not
to
speak
for
some
bad
men
were
seeking
to
destroy
the
boats
and
they
had
moved
away
to
avoid
them
he
then
led
us
to
the
place
where
one
of
them
was
lying
before
long
tsien
and
came
and
got
safely
on
board
and
soon
after
we
were
joined
by
the
teacher
sung
and
the
boat
moved
away
the
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
was
then
explained
a
man
professing
to
be
the
constable
had
come
to
the
boats
in
our
absence
with
a
written
demand
for
ten
dollars
and
a
quantity
of
opium
he
stated
that
there
were
more
than
fifty
country
people
salt
smugglers
awaiting
our
reply
in
an
adjoining
and
if
we
gave
them
what
they
wanted
and
three
hundred
cash
to
pay
for
their
tea
we
might
remain
in
peace
but
that
if
not
they
would
come
at
once
and
destroy
our
boats
sung
told
them
that
we
could
not
comply
with
their
demand
for
not
being
engaged
in
trade
but
only
in
preaching
and
we
had
not
an
atom
of
opium
and
that
our
money
was
nearly
all
expended
the
man
however
told
him
plainly
that
he
did
not
believe
him
and
sung
had
no
alternative
but
to
seek
us
out
desiring
the
man
to
await
our
reply
not
knowing
that
we
had
changed
our
plans
he
sought
us
in
the
wrong
direction
and
of
course
in
vain
in
the
meanwhile
the
boatmen
had
succeeded
in
moving
off
they
were
very
much
alarmed
and
having
so
recently
had
proof
of
what
these
men
would
do
in
open
daylight
felt
no
desire
to
experience
what
they
might
attempt
by
night
moving
away
therefore
they
had
separated
so
that
if
one
boat
should
be
injured
the
other
might
afford
us
a
refuge
it
was
after
this
that
we
had
providentially
met
the
boatman
and
had
been
safely
led
on
board
as
sung
repassed
the
place
where
we
were
previously
moored
he
saw
between
the
trees
a
dozen
or
more
men
and
heard
them
inquiring
where
the
boats
had
gone
to
but
no
one
could
tell
fortunately
they
sought
in
vain
after
a
while
the
two
boats
joined
and
rowed
together
for
some
time
it
was
already
late
and
to
travel
by
night
in
that
part
of
the
country
was
not
the
way
to
avoid
danger
from
evil
men
so
the
question
arose
as
to
what
should
be
done
this
we
left
for
the
boatmen
to
decide
they
had
moved
off
of
their
own
accord
and
we
felt
that
whatever
we
personally
might
desire
we
could
not
constrain
others
to
remain
in
a
position
of
danger
on
our
account
we
urged
them
however
to
do
quickly
whatever
they
intended
to
do
as
the
morrow
was
the
lord
day
when
we
should
not
wish
to
travel
we
also
informed
them
that
wherever
we
were
we
must
fulfil
our
mission
and
preach
the
gospel
it
therefore
made
but
little
difference
where
we
might
stay
for
even
if
we
passed
the
night
unperceived
we
were
sure
to
be
found
out
on
the
following
morning
the
men
consequently
concluded
that
we
might
as
well
return
to
the
place
from
which
we
had
started
to
this
we
fully
agreed
and
they
turned
back
accordingly
but
whether
by
accident
or
no
we
could
not
tell
they
got
into
another
stream
and
rowed
for
some
time
they
knew
not
whither
at
last
as
it
was
very
dark
they
moored
for
the
night
we
then
called
all
the
boatmen
together
with
our
native
assistants
and
read
to
them
the
psalm
it
may
be
imagined
how
appropriate
to
our
position
and
need
and
how
sweetly
consoling
was
this
portion
of
god
word
he
that
dwelleth
in
the
secret
place
of
the
most
high
shall
abide
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
i
will
say
of
the
lord
is
my
refuge
and
my
fortress
my
god
in
him
will
i
trust
surely
he
shall
deliver
thee
from
the
snare
of
the
fowler
and
from
the
noisome
pestilence
he
shall
cover
thee
with
his
feathers
and
under
his
wings
shalt
thou
trust
his
truth
shall
be
thy
shield
and
buckler
thou
shalt
not
be
afraid
for
the
terror
by
night
nor
for
the
arrow
that
flieth
by
day
because
he
hath
set
his
love
upon
me
therefore
will
i
deliver
him
i
will
set
him
on
high
because
he
hath
known
my
name
he
shall
call
upon
me
and
i
will
answer
him
i
will
be
with
him
in
trouble
i
will
deliver
him
and
honour
him
with
long
life
will
i
satisfy
him
and
show
him
my
salvation
committing
ourselves
in
prayer
to
his
care
and
keeping
who
had
covered
us
with
thick
darkness
and
permitted
us
to
escape
from
the
hand
of
the
violent
we
retired
for
the
night
which
thanks
to
the
kind
protection
of
the
watchman
of
israel
who
neither
slumbers
nor
forgets
his
people
we
passed
in
peace
and
quietness
and
were
enabled
in
some
measure
to
realise
the
truth
of
that
precious
word
art
my
and
my
january
this
morning
i
was
awakened
about
by
violent
pain
in
the
i
had
bruised
it
the
day
before
and
severe
inflammation
was
the
result
to
my
great
surprise
i
heard
the
rain
pouring
down
in
torrents
the
weather
having
previously
been
particularly
fine
on
looking
out
we
found
ourselves
so
near
our
former
that
had
nothing
happened
to
prevent
it
we
should
not
have
felt
justified
in
neglecting
to
go
into
the
town
to
preach
as
usual
but
the
rain
was
so
heavy
all
day
that
no
one
could
leave
the
boats
thus
we
enjoyed
a
delightful
day
of
rest
such
as
we
had
not
had
for
some
time
and
the
weather
prevented
much
inquiry
being
made
for
us
had
the
day
been
fine
we
should
most
likely
have
been
discovered
even
if
we
had
not
left
the
boats
as
it
was
we
were
allowed
to
think
in
peace
with
wonder
and
gratitude
of
the
gracious
dealings
of
our
god
who
had
thus
led
us
apart
into
a
desert
place
to
rest
awhile
january
a
cloudless
morning
one
of
the
native
assistants
went
before
daybreak
to
get
some
clothes
which
had
been
given
out
for
washing
he
came
back
with
the
tidings
that
notwithstanding
the
drenching
rain
of
yesterday
men
had
been
seeking
us
in
all
directions
we
had
been
kept
however
in
peace
and
safety
under
the
shadow
of
the
almighty
the
boatmen
were
now
so
thoroughly
alarmed
that
they
would
stay
no
longer
and
moved
off
at
dawn
i
was
confined
to
my
quarters
by
lameness
and
had
no
alternative
but
to
go
with
them
in
the
afternoon
we
reached
on
the
way
to
shanghai
ill
that
god
blesses
is
our
good
and
unblest
good
is
ill
and
all
is
right
that
seems
most
wrong
if
it
be
his
sweet
will

chapter
xii
called
to
swatow
having
to
leave
the
neighbourhood
of
black
town
thus
unexpectedly
was
a
real
disappointment
to
us
as
we
had
hoped
to
spend
some
time
evangelising
in
that
district
we
were
to
prove
however
that
no
unforeseen
mischance
had
happened
but
that
these
circumstances
which
seemed
so
trying
were
necessary
links
in
the
chain
of
a
divinely
ordered
providence
guiding
to
other
and
wider
spheres
god
does
not
permit
persecution
to
arise
without
sufficient
reason
he
was
leading
us
by
a
way
that
we
knew
not
but
it
was
none
the
less
his
way
o
lord
how
happy
should
we
be
if
we
would
cast
our
care
on
thee
if
we
from
self
would
rest
and
feel
at
heart
that
one
above
in
perfect
wisdom
perfect
love
is
working
for
the
best
when
we
reached
shanghai
thinking
to
return
inland
in
a
few
days
with
fresh
supplies
of
books
and
money
we
met
a
christian
captain
who
had
been
trading
at
swatow
and
he
put
very
strongly
before
us
the
need
of
that
region
and
the
fact
that
there
were
british
merchants
living
on
double
island
selling
opium
and
engaged
in
the
coolie
trade
practically
a
slave
traffic
while
there
was
no
british
missionary
to
preach
the
gospel
the
spirit
of
god
impressed
me
with
the
feeling
that
this
was
his
call
but
for
days
i
felt
that
i
could
not
obey
it
i
had
never
had
such
a
spiritual
father
as
burns
i
had
never
known
such
holy
happy
fellowship
and
i
said
to
myself
that
it
could
not
be
will
that
we
should
separate
in
great
unrest
of
soul
i
went
one
evening
with
burns
to
take
tea
at
the
house
of
the
rev
lowrie
of
the
american
presbyterian
mission
at
the
south
gate
of
shanghai
after
tea
lowrie
played
over
to
us
the
missionary
call
i
had
never
heard
it
before
and
it
greatly
affected
me
my
heart
was
almost
broken
before
it
was
finished
and
i
said
to
the
lord
in
the
words
that
had
been
sung
and
i
will
go
i
may
no
longer
doubt
to
give
up
friends
and
idol
hopes
and
every
tie
that
binds
my
heart
henceforth
then
it
matters
not
if
storm
or
sunshine
be
my
earthly
lot
bitter
or
sweet
my
cup
i
only
pray
god
make
me
holy
and
my
spirit
nerve
for
the
stern
hour
of
strife
upon
leaving
i
asked
burns
to
come
home
with
me
to
the
little
house
that
was
still
my
headquarters
in
the
native
city
and
there
with
many
tears
told
him
how
the
lord
had
been
leading
me
and
how
rebellious
i
had
been
and
unwilling
to
leave
him
for
this
new
sphere
of
labour
he
listened
with
a
strange
look
of
surprise
and
of
pleasure
rather
than
pain
and
answered
that
he
had
determined
that
very
night
to
tell
me
that
he
had
heard
the
lord
call
to
swatow
and
that
his
one
regret
had
been
the
prospect
of
the
severance
of
our
happy
fellowship
we
went
together
and
thus
was
recommenced
missionary
work
in
that
part
of
china
which
in
later
years
has
been
so
abundantly
blessed
long
before
this
time
the
rev
lechler
of
the
basel
missionary
society
had
widely
itinerated
in
the
neighbourhood
of
swatow
and
the
surrounding
regions
driven
about
from
place
to
place
he
had
done
work
that
was
not
forgotten
although
ultimately
he
was
obliged
to
retire
to
for
more
than
forty
years
this
servant
of
god
has
continued
in
labours
more
abundant
and
quite
recently
he
has
left
with
his
devoted
wife
to
return
again
inland
and
spend
the
strength
of
his
remaining
years
amongst
the
people
he
has
so
long
and
truly
loved
captain
bowers
the
christian
friend
who
had
been
used
of
god
in
bringing
the
needs
of
swatow
before
burns
and
myself
was
overjoyed
when
he
heard
of
our
decision
to
devote
ourselves
to
the
evangelisation
of
that
busy
important
and
populous
mart
being
about
to
sail
himself
on
his
return
journey
he
gladly
offered
us
free
passages
on
board
the
in
which
we
left
shanghai
early
in
the
month
of
march
a
favourable
journey
of
six
days
brought
us
to
double
island
where
we
found
ourselves
landed
in
the
midst
of
a
small
but
very
ungodly
community
of
foreigners
engaged
in
the
opium
trade
and
other
commercial
enterprises
unwilling
to
be
in
any
way
identified
with
these
we
were
most
desirous
of
obtaining
quarters
at
once
within
the
native
city
situated
on
a
promontory
of
the
mainland
five
miles
farther
up
at
the
mouth
of
the
han
river
great
difficulty
was
experienced
in
this
attempt
to
obtain
a
footing
amongst
the
people
indeed
it
seemed
as
though
we
should
fail
altogether
and
we
were
helplessly
cast
upon
the
lord
in
prayer
our
god
soon
undertook
for
us
meeting
one
day
with
a
cantonese
merchant
a
relative
of
the
highest
official
in
the
town
burns
addressed
him
in
the
cantonese
dialect
this
gentleman
was
so
pleased
at
being
spoken
to
by
a
foreigner
in
his
own
tongue
that
he
became
our
friend
and
secured
us
a
lodging
we
had
only
one
little
room
however
and
not
easily
shall
i
forget
the
long
hot
summer
months
in
that
place
where
towards
the
eaves
one
could
touch
the
heated
tiles
with
one
hand
more
room
or
better
accommodation
it
was
impossible
to
obtain
we
varied
our
stay
by
visits
to
the
surrounding
country
but
the
difficulties
and
dangers
that
encountered
us
here
were
so
great
and
constant
that
our
former
work
in
the
north
began
to
appear
safe
and
easy
in
comparison
the
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
cantonese
was
very
painful
foreign
devil
foreign
dog
or
foreign
pig
being
the
commonest
appellations
but
all
this
led
us
into
deeper
fellowship
than
i
had
ever
known
before
with
him
who
was
despised
and
rejected
of
men
in
our
visits
to
the
country
we
were
liable
to
be
seized
at
any
time
and
held
to
ransom
and
the
people
commonly
declared
that
the
whole
district
was
without
emperor
without
ruler
and
without
law
certainly
might
was
right
in
those
days
on
one
occasion
we
were
visiting
a
small
town
and
found
that
the
inhabitants
had
captured
a
wealthy
man
of
another
clan
a
large
ransom
was
demanded
for
his
release
and
on
his
refusing
to
pay
it
they
had
smashed
his
one
by
one
with
a
club
and
thus
extorted
the
promise
they
desired
there
was
nothing
but
protection
to
prevent
our
being
treated
in
the
same
way
the
towns
were
all
walled
and
one
such
place
would
contain
ten
or
twenty
thousand
people
of
the
same
clan
and
surname
who
were
frequently
at
war
with
the
people
living
in
the
next
town
to
be
kindly
received
in
one
place
was
not
uncommonly
a
source
of
danger
in
the
next
in
circumstances
such
as
these
the
preserving
care
of
our
god
was
often
manifested
after
a
time
the
local
mandarin
became
ill
and
the
native
doctors
were
unable
to
relieve
him
he
had
heard
from
some
who
had
been
under
my
treatment
of
the
benefit
derived
and
was
led
to
seek
our
help
god
blessed
the
medicines
given
and
grateful
for
relief
he
advised
our
renting
a
house
for
a
hospital
and
dispensary
having
his
permission
we
were
able
to
secure
the
entire
premises
one
room
of
which
we
had
previously
occupied
i
had
left
my
stock
of
medicine
and
surgical
instruments
under
the
care
of
my
friend
the
late
wylie
in
shanghai
and
went
back
at
once
to
fetch
them
burns
came
down
from
a
town
called
that
we
had
visited
together
several
times
to
see
me
off
and
returned
again
when
i
had
sailed
with
two
native
evangelists
sent
up
from
by
the
rev
johnson
of
the
american
baptist
missionary
union
the
people
were
willing
to
listen
to
their
preaching
and
to
accept
their
books
as
a
gift
but
they
would
not
buy
them
one
night
robbers
broke
in
and
carried
off
everything
they
had
with
the
exception
of
their
stock
of
literature
which
was
supposed
to
be
valueless
next
morning
very
early
they
were
knocked
up
by
persons
wishing
to
buy
books
and
the
sales
continued
so
that
by
breakfast
time
they
had
not
only
cash
enough
to
procure
food
but
to
pay
also
for
the
passage
of
one
of
the
men
to
double
island
below
swatow
with
a
letter
to
burns
agent
to
supply
him
with
money
purchasers
continued
coming
during
that
day
and
the
next
and
our
friends
lacked
nothing
but
on
the
third
day
they
could
not
sell
a
single
book
then
however
when
the
cash
from
their
sales
was
just
exhausted
the
messenger
returned
with
supplies
it
was
early
in
july
after
about
four
months
residence
in
swatow
that
i
left
for
shanghai
intending
to
return
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
bringing
with
me
my
medical
apparatus
for
further
work
in
association
with
the
rev
william
burns
a
new
and
promising
field
seemed
to
be
opening
before
us
and
it
was
with
much
hopeful
anticipation
that
we
looked
forward
to
the
future
of
the
work
marked
blessing
was
indeed
in
store
for
the
city
and
neighbourhood
of
swatow
but
it
was
not
the
purpose
of
god
that
either
of
us
should
remain
to
reap
the
harvest
burns
while
in
the
interior
was
taken
up
and
imprisoned
by
the
chinese
authorities
soon
after
i
left
and
was
sent
to
canton
and
though
he
returned
to
swatow
after
the
war
had
broken
out
he
was
called
away
for
other
service
which
prevented
his
subsequent
return
while
my
journey
to
shanghai
proved
to
be
the
first
step
in
a
diverging
pathway
leading
to
other
spheres

it
is
interesting
to
notice
the
various
events
which
united
in
the
providence
of
god
in
preventing
my
return
to
swatow
and
ultimately
led
to
my
settling
in
ningpo
and
making
that
the
centre
for
the
development
of
future
labours
upon
reaching
shanghai
great
was
my
dismay
to
find
that
the
premises
in
which
my
medicines
and
instruments
had
been
stored
were
burnt
down
and
that
all
the
medicines
and
many
of
the
instruments
were
entirely
destroyed
to
me
this
appeared
a
great
calamity
and
i
fear
i
was
more
disposed
with
faithless
jacob
to
say
all
these
things
are
against
me
than
to
recognise
that
all
things
work
together
for
good
i
had
not
then
learned
to
think
of
god
as
the
one
great
circumstance
in
whom
we
live
and
move
and
have
our
being
and
of
lesser
external
circumstances
as
necessarily
the
kindest
wisest
best
because
either
ordered
or
permitted
by
him
hence
my
disappointment
and
trial
were
very
great
medicines
were
expensive
in
shanghai
and
my
means
were
limited
i
therefore
set
out
on
an
inland
journey
to
ningpo
hoping
to
obtain
a
supply
from
william
parker
a
member
of
the
same
mission
as
myself
i
took
with
me
my
few
remaining
possessions
the
principal
being
my
watch
a
few
surgical
instruments
a
concertina
books
for
the
study
of
chinese
which
in
those
days
were
very
expensive
but
left
behind
in
shanghai
a
portion
of
my
money
the
country
through
which
i
had
to
pass
was
suffering
much
from
drought
it
was
the
height
of
summer
and
the
water
in
the
grand
canal
was
very
low
having
been
largely
drawn
upon
for
the
neighbouring
rice
fields
as
well
as
evaporated
by
the
intense
heat
i
had
determined
to
make
the
journey
as
much
of
a
mission
tour
as
possible
and
set
out
well
supplied
with
christian
tracts
and
books
after
fourteen
days
spent
in
travelling
slowly
through
the
populous
country
preaching
and
distributing
books
we
reached
a
large
town
called
and
here
finding
that
my
supply
of
literature
was
exhausted
i
determined
not
to
linger
over
the
rest
of
the
journey
but
to
reach
ningpo
as
speedily
as
possible
the
city
of
there
was
no
water
beyond
so
i
paid
off
my
boat
hired
coolies
to
carry
my
things
as
far
as
to
and
ere
sunrise
we
were
on
the
way
i
walked
on
alone
leaving
my
servant
to
follow
with
the
men
who
made
frequent
stoppages
to
rest
and
on
reaching
a
city
through
which
we
had
to
pass
i
waited
for
them
in
a
just
outside
the
north
gate
the
coolies
came
on
very
slowly
and
seemed
tired
when
they
arrived
i
soon
found
that
they
were
both
so
that
although
they
had
only
carried
a
load
that
one
strong
man
would
think
nothing
of
taking
three
times
the
distance
they
really
seemed
wearied
after
some
rice
and
tea
and
an
hour
rest
including
i
doubt
not
a
smoke
of
the
opium
pipe
they
were
a
little
refreshed
and
i
proposed
moving
on
that
we
might
get
to
before
the
sun
became
too
powerful
my
servant
however
had
a
friend
in
the
city
and
he
desired
to
spend
the
day
there
and
to
go
on
next
morning
but
to
this
i
objected
wishing
to
reach
that
night
if
possible
we
therefore
set
off
entered
the
north
gate
and
had
passed
through
about
a
third
of
the
city
when
the
coolies
stopped
to
rest
and
said
they
should
be
unable
to
carry
the
burden
on
to
finally
they
agreed
to
take
it
to
the
south
gate
where
they
were
to
be
paid
in
proportion
to
the
distance
they
had
carried
it
and
the
servant
undertook
to
call
other
coolies
and
come
along
with
them
i
walked
on
before
as
in
the
first
instance
and
the
distance
being
only
about
four
miles
soon
reached
and
waited
their
arrival
meanwhile
engaging
coolies
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
to
having
waited
a
long
time
i
began
to
wonder
at
the
delay
and
at
length
it
became
too
late
to
finish
the
journey
to
that
night
i
felt
somewhat
annoyed
and
but
that
my
feet
were
blistered
and
the
afternoon
very
hot
i
should
have
gone
back
to
meet
them
and
urge
them
on
at
last
i
concluded
that
my
servant
must
have
gone
to
his
friend
and
would
not
appear
until
evening
but
evening
came
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
them
feeling
very
uneasy
i
began
diligently
to
inquire
whether
they
had
been
seen
at
last
a
man
responded
are
you
a
guest
from
i
answered
in
the
affirmative
are
you
going
to
that
is
my
destination
then
your
things
have
gone
on
before
you
for
i
was
sitting
in
a
when
a
coolie
came
in
took
a
cup
of
tea
and
set
off
for
in
a
great
hurry
saying
that
the
bamboo
box
and
bed
he
carried
which
were
just
such
as
you
describe
yours
to
have
been
were
from
and
he
had
to
take
them
to
where
he
was
to
be
paid
at
the
rate
of
ten
cash
a
pound
from
this
i
concluded
that
my
goods
were
on
before
me
but
it
was
impossible
to
follow
them
at
once
for
i
was
too
tired
to
walk
and
it
was
already
dark
under
these
circumstances
all
i
could
do
was
to
seek
a
lodging
for
the
night
and
no
easy
task
i
found
it
after
raising
my
heart
to
god
to
ask
his
aid
i
walked
through
to
the
farther
end
of
the
town
where
i
thought
the
tidings
of
a
foreigner
being
in
the
place
might
not
have
spread
and
looked
out
for
an
inn
i
soon
came
to
one
and
went
in
hoping
that
i
might
pass
unquestioned
as
it
was
already
dark
asking
the
bill
of
fare
i
was
told
that
cold
rice
which
proved
to
be
more
than
rather
burnt
and
snakes
fried
in
were
all
that
could
be
had
not
wishing
any
question
to
be
raised
as
to
my
nationality
i
was
compelled
to
order
some
and
tried
to
make
a
meal
but
with
little
success
while
thus
engaged
i
said
to
the
landlord
i
suppose
i
can
arrange
to
spend
the
night
here
to
which
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
but
bringing
out
his
book
he
added
in
these
unsettled
times
we
are
required
by
the
authorities
to
keep
a
record
of
our
lodgers
may
i
ask
your
respected
family
name
my
unworthy
family
name
is
tai
i
responded
and
your
honourable
second
name
my
humble
name
is
james
what
an
extraordinary
name
i
never
heard
it
before
how
do
you
write
it
i
told
him
and
added
it
is
a
common
name
in
the
district
from
which
i
come
and
may
i
ask
whence
you
come
and
whither
you
are
going
i
am
journeying
from
shanghai
to
ningpo
by
way
of
what
may
be
your
honourable
profession
i
heal
the
sick
oh
you
are
a
physician
the
landlord
remarked
and
to
my
intense
relief
closed
the
book
his
wife
however
took
up
the
conversation
you
are
a
physician
are
you
said
she
i
am
glad
of
that
for
i
have
a
daughter
afflicted
with
leprosy
if
you
will
cure
her
you
shall
have
your
supper
and
bed
for
nothing
i
was
curious
enough
to
inquire
what
my
supper
and
bed
were
to
cost
if
paid
for
and
to
my
amusement
found
they
were
worth
less
than
of
our
money
being
unable
to
benefit
the
girl
i
declined
to
prescribe
for
her
saying
that
leprosy
was
a
very
intractable
disease
and
that
i
had
no
medicines
with
me
the
mother
however
brought
pen
and
paper
urging
you
can
at
least
write
a
prescription
which
will
do
no
harm
if
it
does
no
good
but
this
also
i
declined
to
do
and
requested
to
be
shown
my
bed
i
was
conducted
to
a
very
miserable
room
on
the
where
on
some
boards
raised
upon
two
stools
i
passed
the
night
without
bed
or
pillow
save
my
umbrella
and
shoe
and
without
any
mosquito
netting
ten
or
eleven
other
lodgers
were
sleeping
in
the
same
room
so
i
could
not
take
anything
off
for
fear
of
its
being
stolen
but
i
was
i
found
by
no
means
too
warm
as
midnight
came
on
as
may
be
supposed
i
arose
but
little
rested
or
refreshed
and
felt
very
far
from
well
i
had
to
wait
a
long
time
ere
breakfast
was
obtainable
and
then
there
was
another
delay
before
i
could
get
change
for
the
only
dollar
i
had
with
me
in
consequence
of
its
being
chipped
in
one
or
two
places
more
than
three
hundred
cash
also
were
deducted
from
its
price
on
this
account
which
was
a
serious
loss
to
me
in
my
trying
position
i
then
sought
throughout
the
town
for
tidings
of
my
servant
and
coolies
as
i
thought
it
possible
that
they
might
have
arrived
later
or
have
come
on
in
the
morning
the
town
is
large
long
and
straggling
being
nearly
two
miles
from
one
end
to
the
other
so
this
occupied
some
time
i
gained
no
information
however
and
footsore
and
weary
set
out
for
in
the
full
heat
of
the
day
the
journey
about
eight
miles
took
me
a
long
time
but
a
halfway
village
afforded
a
and
a
cup
of
tea
both
of
which
i
gladly
availed
myself
of
when
about
to
leave
again
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
came
on
and
the
delay
thus
occasioned
enabled
me
to
speak
a
little
to
the
people
about
the
truths
of
the
gospel
the
afternoon
was
far
spent
before
i
approached
the
northern
suburb
of
where
i
commenced
inquiries
but
could
hear
no
tidings
of
my
servant
or
things
i
was
told
that
outside
the
east
gate
i
should
be
more
likely
to
hear
of
them
as
it
was
there
the
called
i
therefore
proceeded
thither
and
sought
for
them
outside
the
little
east
gate
but
in
vain
very
weary
i
sat
down
in
a
to
rest
and
while
there
a
number
of
persons
from
one
of
the
mandarin
offices
came
in
and
made
inquiries
as
to
who
i
was
where
i
had
come
from
etc
on
learning
the
object
of
my
search
one
of
the
men
in
the
said
a
bamboo
box
and
a
bed
such
as
you
describe
were
carried
past
here
about
half
an
hour
ago
the
bearer
seemed
to
be
going
towards
either
the
great
east
gate
or
the
south
gate
you
had
better
go
to
the
hongs
there
and
inquire
i
asked
him
to
accompany
me
in
the
search
and
promised
to
reward
him
for
his
trouble
but
he
would
not
another
man
offered
to
go
with
me
so
we
set
off
together
and
both
inside
and
outside
the
two
gates
made
diligent
inquiries
but
all
in
vain
i
then
engaged
a
man
to
make
a
thorough
search
promising
him
a
liberal
reward
if
he
should
be
successful
in
the
meantime
i
had
some
dinner
and
addressed
a
large
concourse
of
people
who
had
gathered
together
when
he
returned
having
met
with
no
success
i
said
to
him
i
am
now
quite
exhausted
will
you
help
me
to
find
quarters
for
the
night
and
then
i
will
pay
you
for
your
trouble
he
was
willing
to
befriend
me
and
we
set
off
in
search
of
lodgings
at
the
first
place
or
two
the
people
would
not
receive
me
for
though
on
our
first
going
in
they
seemed
willing
to
do
so
the
presence
of
a
man
who
followed
us
and
who
i
found
was
engaged
in
one
of
the
government
offices
seemed
to
alarm
them
and
i
was
refused
we
now
went
to
a
third
place
and
being
no
longer
followed
by
the
mandarin
messenger
we
were
promised
quarters
some
tea
was
brought
and
i
paid
the
man
who
had
accompanied
me
for
his
trouble
soon
after
he
was
gone
some
official
people
came
in
they
soon
went
away
but
the
result
of
their
visit
was
that
i
was
told
i
could
not
be
entertained
there
that
night
a
young
man
present
blamed
them
for
their
heartless
behaviour
and
said
never
mind
come
with
me
and
if
we
can
not
get
better
lodgings
for
you
you
shall
sleep
at
our
house
i
went
with
him
but
we
found
the
people
of
his
house
unwilling
to
receive
me
weary
and
footsore
so
that
i
could
scarcely
stand
i
had
again
to
seek
quarters
and
at
length
got
promise
of
them
but
a
little
crowd
collecting
about
the
door
they
desired
me
to
go
to
a
and
wait
there
till
the
people
had
retired
or
they
would
be
unable
to
accommodate
me
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
i
went
accompanied
still
by
the
young
man
and
waited
till
past
midnight
then
we
left
for
the
promised
but
my
conductor
would
not
find
it
and
he
led
me
about
to
another
part
of
the
city
and
finally
between
one
and
two
he
left
me
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
as
best
i
could
i
was
opposite
a
temple
but
it
was
closed
so
i
lay
down
on
the
stone
steps
in
front
of
it
and
putting
my
money
under
my
head
for
a
pillow
should
soon
have
been
asleep
in
spite
of
the
cold
had
i
not
perceived
a
person
coming
stealthily
towards
me
as
he
approached
i
saw
he
was
one
of
the
beggars
so
common
in
china
and
had
no
doubt
his
intention
was
to
rob
me
of
my
money
i
did
not
stir
but
watched
his
movements
and
looked
to
my
father
not
to
leave
me
in
this
hour
of
trial
the
man
came
up
looked
at
me
for
some
time
to
assure
himself
that
i
was
asleep
it
was
so
dark
that
he
could
not
see
my
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
then
began
to
feel
about
me
gently
i
said
to
him
in
the
quietest
tone
but
so
as
to
convince
him
that
i
was
not
nor
had
been
sleeping
what
do
you
want
he
made
no
answer
but
went
away
i
was
very
thankful
to
see
him
go
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
put
as
much
of
my
cash
as
would
not
go
into
my
pocket
safely
up
my
sleeve
and
made
my
pillow
of
a
stone
projection
of
the
wall
it
was
not
long
ere
i
began
to
doze
but
i
was
aroused
by
the
all
but
noiseless
footsteps
of
two
persons
approaching
for
my
nervous
system
was
rendered
so
sensitive
by
exhaustion
that
the
slightest
noise
startled
me
again
i
sought
protection
from
him
who
alone
was
my
stay
and
lay
still
as
before
till
one
of
them
came
up
and
began
to
feel
under
my
head
for
the
cash
i
spoke
again
and
they
sat
down
at
my
feet
i
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
they
replied
that
they
like
me
were
going
to
pass
the
night
there
i
then
requested
them
to
take
the
opposite
side
as
there
was
plenty
of
room
and
leave
this
side
to
me
but
they
would
not
move
from
my
feet
so
i
raised
myself
up
and
set
my
back
against
the
wall
they
said
you
had
better
lie
down
and
sleep
if
you
do
not
you
will
be
unable
to
walk
do
not
be
afraid
we
shall
not
leave
you
and
will
see
that
no
one
hurts
you
listen
to
me
i
replied
i
do
not
want
your
protection
i
need
it
not
i
am
not
a
chinese
i
do
not
worship
your
senseless
helpless
idols
i
worship
god
he
is
my
father
i
trust
in
him
i
know
well
what
you
are
and
what
your
intentions
are
and
shall
keep
my
eye
on
you
and
shall
not
sleep
on
this
one
of
them
went
away
but
soon
returned
with
a
third
companion
i
felt
very
uneasy
but
looked
to
god
for
help
once
or
twice
one
of
them
got
up
to
see
if
i
was
asleep
i
only
said
do
not
be
mistaken
i
am
not
sleeping
occasionally
my
head
dropped
and
this
was
a
signal
for
one
of
them
to
rise
but
i
at
once
roused
myself
and
made
some
remark
as
the
night
slowly
passed
on
i
felt
very
weary
and
to
keep
myself
awake
as
well
as
to
cheer
my
mind
i
sang
several
hymns
repeated
aloud
some
portions
of
scripture
and
engaged
in
prayer
in
english
to
the
great
annoyance
of
my
companions
who
seemed
as
if
they
would
have
given
anything
to
get
me
to
desist
after
that
they
troubled
me
no
more
and
shortly
before
dawn
of
day
they
left
me
and
i
got
a
little
sleep
i
was
awakened
by
the
young
man
who
had
so
misled
me
on
the
previous
evening
he
was
very
rude
and
insisted
on
my
getting
up
and
paying
him
for
his
trouble
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
try
to
accomplish
by
force
what
he
wanted
this
roused
me
and
in
an
unguarded
moment
with
very
improper
feeling
i
seized
his
arm
with
such
a
grasp
as
he
little
expected
i
was
capable
of
and
dared
him
to
lay
a
finger
upon
me
again
or
to
annoy
me
further
this
quite
changed
his
manner
he
let
me
quietly
remain
till
the
guns
announced
the
opening
of
the
gates
of
the
city
and
then
he
begged
me
to
give
him
some
money
to
buy
opium
with
it
is
needless
to
say
this
was
refused
i
gave
him
the
price
of
two
candles
that
he
said
he
had
burnt
while
with
me
last
night
and
no
more
i
learned
he
was
connected
with
one
of
the
mandarin
offices
as
soon
as
possible
i
bought
some
rice
gruel
and
tea
for
breakfast
and
then
once
more
made
a
personal
search
after
my
things
some
hours
thus
spent
proving
unavailing
i
set
out
on
the
return
journey
and
after
a
long
weary
and
painful
walk
reached
about
noon
here
also
my
inquiries
failed
to
give
me
any
trace
of
the
missing
goods
so
i
had
a
meal
cooked
in
a
got
a
thorough
wash
and
bathed
my
inflamed
feet
and
after
dinner
rested
and
slept
till
four
in
the
afternoon
much
refreshed
i
then
set
on
to
return
to
the
city
at
the
south
gate
of
which
i
had
parted
with
my
servant
and
coolies
two
days
before
on
the
way
i
was
led
to
reflect
on
the
goodness
of
god
and
recollected
that
i
had
not
made
it
a
matter
of
prayer
that
i
might
be
provided
with
lodgings
last
night
i
felt
condemned
too
that
i
should
have
been
so
anxious
for
my
few
things
while
the
many
precious
souls
around
me
had
caused
so
little
emotion
i
came
as
a
sinner
and
pleaded
the
blood
of
jesus
realising
that
i
was
accepted
in
him
pardoned
cleansed
sanctified
and
oh
the
love
of
jesus
how
great
i
felt
it
to
be
i
knew
something
more
than
i
had
ever
previously
known
of
what
it
was
to
be
despised
and
rejected
and
to
have
nowhere
to
lay
one
head
and
i
felt
more
than
ever
i
had
done
before
the
greatness
of
that
love
which
induced
him
to
leave
his
home
in
glory
and
suffer
thus
for
me
nay
to
lay
down
his
very
life
upon
the
cross
i
thought
of
him
as
despised
and
rejected
of
men
a
man
of
sorrows
and
acquainted
with
grief
i
thought
of
him
at
jacob
well
weary
hungry
and
thirsty
yet
finding
it
his
meat
and
drink
to
do
his
father
will
and
contrasted
this
with
my
littleness
of
love
i
looked
to
him
for
pardon
for
the
past
and
for
grace
and
strength
to
do
his
will
in
the
future
to
tread
more
closely
in
his
footsteps
and
be
more
than
ever
wholly
his
i
prayed
for
myself
for
friends
in
england
and
for
my
brethren
in
the
work
sweet
tears
of
mingled
joy
and
sorrow
flowed
freely
the
road
was
almost
forgotten
and
before
i
was
aware
of
it
i
had
reached
my
destination
outside
the
south
gate
i
took
a
cup
of
tea
asked
about
my
lost
luggage
and
spoke
of
the
love
of
jesus
then
i
entered
the
city
and
after
many
vain
inquiries
left
it
by
the
north
gate
i
felt
so
much
refreshed
both
in
mind
and
body
by
the
communion
i
had
on
my
walk
to
the
city
that
i
thought
myself
able
to
finish
the
remaining
six
miles
back
to
that
evening
first
i
went
into
another
to
buy
some
native
cakes
and
was
making
a
meal
of
them
when
who
should
come
in
but
one
of
the
identical
coolies
who
had
carried
my
things
the
first
stage
from
him
i
learned
that
after
i
left
them
they
had
taken
my
luggage
to
the
south
gate
there
my
servant
went
away
saying
on
his
return
that
i
had
gone
on
that
he
did
not
intend
to
start
at
once
but
would
spend
the
day
with
his
friend
and
then
rejoin
me
they
carried
the
things
to
this
friend
house
and
left
them
there
i
got
him
to
go
with
me
to
the
house
and
there
learned
that
the
man
had
spent
the
day
and
night
with
them
and
next
morning
had
called
other
coolies
and
set
off
for
this
was
all
i
could
gather
so
unable
to
do
anything
but
proceed
on
my
return
journey
to
shanghai
with
all
expedition
i
left
the
city
again
it
was
now
too
late
to
go
on
to
i
looked
to
my
father
as
able
to
supply
all
my
need
and
received
another
token
of
his
ceaseless
love
and
care
being
invited
to
sleep
on
a
now
dry
in
the
bed
of
the
river
the
night
was
again
very
cold
and
the
mosquitoes
troublesome
still
i
got
a
little
rest
and
at
sunrise
was
up
and
continued
my
journey
i
felt
very
ill
at
first
and
had
a
sore
throat
but
reflected
on
the
wonderful
goodness
of
god
in
enabling
me
to
bear
the
heat
by
day
and
the
cold
by
night
so
long
i
felt
also
that
quite
a
load
was
now
taken
off
my
mind
i
had
committed
myself
and
my
affairs
to
the
lord
and
knew
that
if
it
was
for
my
good
and
for
his
glory
my
things
would
be
restored
if
not
all
would
be
for
the
best
i
hoped
that
the
most
trying
part
of
my
journey
was
now
drawing
to
a
close
and
this
helped
me
weary
and
footsore
on
the
way
when
i
got
to
and
had
breakfasted
i
found
i
had
still
eight
hundred
and
ten
cash
in
hand
and
i
knew
that
the
fare
to
fu
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
cash
and
thence
to
shanghai
three
hundred
and
sixty
leaving
me
just
three
hundred
and
thirty
cash
or
twelve
pence
and
a
fraction
for
three
or
four
days
provisions
i
went
at
once
to
the
boat
office
but
to
my
dismay
found
that
from
the
dry
state
of
the
river
goods
had
not
come
down
so
that
no
boat
would
leave
and
perhaps
none
i
inquired
if
there
were
no
for
fu
and
was
told
that
they
had
already
left
the
only
remaining
resource
was
to
ascertain
if
any
private
boats
were
going
in
which
i
could
get
a
passage
my
search
however
was
in
vain
and
i
could
get
no
boat
to
undertake
to
go
all
the
way
to
shanghai
or
my
difficulty
would
have
been
at
an
end
just
at
this
juncture
i
saw
before
me
at
a
turn
in
the
canal
a
going
in
the
direction
of
fu
this
i
concluded
must
be
one
of
the
boats
that
had
been
unexpectedly
detained
and
i
set
off
after
it
as
fast
as
hope
and
the
necessities
of
the
case
would
carry
me
for
the
time
being
weariness
and
sore
feet
were
alike
forgotten
after
a
chase
of
about
a
mile
i
overtook
it
are
you
going
to
fu
i
called
out
no
was
the
only
answer
are
you
going
in
that
direction
no
will
you
give
me
a
passage
as
far
as
you
do
go
that
way
still
no
and
nothing
more
completely
dispirited
and
exhausted
i
sank
down
on
the
grass
and
fainted
away
as
consciousness
returned
some
voices
reached
my
ear
and
i
found
they
were
talking
about
me
one
said
he
speaks
pure
shanghai
dialect
and
from
their
own
speech
i
knew
them
to
be
shanghai
people
raising
myself
i
saw
that
they
were
on
a
large
on
the
other
side
of
the
canal
and
after
a
few
words
they
sent
their
small
boat
to
fetch
me
and
i
went
on
board
the
junk
they
were
very
kind
and
gave
me
some
tea
and
when
i
was
refreshed
and
able
to
partake
of
it
some
food
also
i
then
took
my
shoes
and
stockings
off
to
ease
my
feet
and
the
boatman
kindly
provided
me
with
hot
water
to
bathe
them
when
they
heard
my
story
and
saw
the
blisters
on
my
feet
they
evidently
pitied
me
and
hailed
every
boat
that
passed
to
see
if
it
was
going
my
way
not
finding
one
by
and
by
after
a
few
hours
sleep
i
went
ashore
with
the
captain
intending
to
preach
in
the
temple
of
before
leaving
the
junk
i
told
the
captain
and
those
on
board
that
i
was
now
unable
to
help
myself
that
i
had
not
strength
to
walk
to
fu
and
having
been
disappointed
in
getting
a
passage
i
should
no
longer
have
sufficient
means
to
take
me
there
by
which
was
an
expensive
mode
of
travelling
that
i
knew
not
how
the
god
whom
i
served
would
help
me
but
that
i
had
no
doubt
he
would
do
so
and
that
my
business
now
was
to
serve
him
where
i
was
i
also
told
them
that
the
help
which
i
knew
would
come
ought
to
be
an
evidence
to
them
of
the
truth
of
the
religion
which
i
and
the
other
missionaries
at
shanghai
preached
on
our
way
to
the
town
while
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
captain
we
saw
a
coming
up
the
captain
drew
my
attention
to
it
but
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
no
longer
the
means
of
paying
my
passage
by
it
he
hailed
it
nevertheless
and
found
that
it
was
going
to
a
place
about
nine
english
miles
from
shanghai
whence
one
of
the
boatmen
would
carry
the
mails
overland
to
the
city
he
then
said
this
gentleman
is
a
foreigner
from
shanghai
who
has
been
robbed
and
has
no
longer
the
means
of
returning
if
you
will
take
him
with
you
as
far
as
you
go
and
then
engage
a
sedan
chair
to
carry
him
the
rest
of
the
way
he
will
pay
you
in
shanghai
you
see
my
boat
is
lying
aground
yonder
for
want
of
water
and
can
not
get
away
now
i
will
stand
surety
and
if
this
gentleman
does
not
pay
when
you
get
to
shanghai
i
will
do
so
on
your
return
this
unsolicited
kindness
on
the
part
of
a
chinaman
a
perfect
stranger
will
appear
the
more
remarkable
to
any
one
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
chinese
who
are
generally
most
reluctant
to
risk
their
money
those
on
the
agreeing
to
the
terms
i
was
taken
on
board
as
a
passenger
oh
how
thankful
i
felt
for
this
providential
interposition
and
to
be
once
more
on
my
way
to
shanghai
such
as
the
one
on
which
i
was
now
travelling

of
a
long
narrow
build

very
limited

to
their
inside
accommodation
one
has
to
lie
down
all
the
time
they
are
in
motion
as
a
slight
movement
would
easily
upset
them
this
was
no
irksome
condition
to
me
however
on
the
contrary
i
was
only
too
glad
to
be
quiet
they
are
the
quickest
boats
i
have
seen
in
china
each
one
is
worked
by
two
men
who
relieve
one
another
continuously
night
and
day
they
row
with
their
feet
and
paddle
with
their
hands
or
if
the
wind
is
quite
favourable
row
with
their
feet
and
with
one
hand
manage
a
small
sail
while
steering
with
the
other
after
a
pleasant
and
speedy
journey
i
reached
shanghai
in
safety
on
august
through
the
help
of
him
who
has
said
i
will
never
leave
thee
nor
forsake
thee
lo
i
am
with
you
alway
even
unto
the
end

providential
guidance
it
now
seemed
very
clear
that
the
lost
property
including
everything
i
possessed
in
china
with
the
exception
of
a
small
sum
of
money
providentially
left
in
shanghai
had
been
deliberately
stolen
by
my
servant
who
had
gone
off
with
it
to
the
first
question
of
course
was
how
best
to
act
for
the
good
of
the
man
who
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
trouble
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
take
steps
that
would
have
led
to
his
punishment
though
the
likelihood
of
any
reparation
being
made
for
the
loss
sustained
was
very
small
but
the
consideration
which
weighed
most
heavily
was
that
the
thief
was
a
man
for
whose
salvation
i
had
laboured
and
prayed
and
i
felt
that
to
prosecute
him
would
not
be
to
emphasise
the
teaching
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
in
which
we
had
read
together
resist
not
evil
and
other
similar
precepts
finally
concluding
that
his
soul
was
of
more
value
than
the
worth
of
things
i
had
lost
i
wrote
and
told
him
this
urging
upon
him
his
need
of
repentance
and
faith
in
the
lord
jesus
christ
the
course
i
took
commended
itself
to
my
christian
friends
in
england
one
of
whom
was
afterwards
led
to
send
me
a
cheque
for
the
first
of
many
subsequently
received
from
the
same
kind
helper
having
obtained
the
little
money
left
in
shanghai
i
again
set
out
for
ningpo
to
seek
assistance
from
parker
in
replacing
the
medicines
i
had
previously
lost
by
fire
this
being
satisfactorily
accomplished
i
returned
once
more
to
shanghai
for
swatow
hoping
soon
to
rejoin
my
friend
burns
in
the
work
in
that
important
centre
god
had
willed
it
otherwise
however
and
the
delay
caused
by
the
robbery
was
just
sufficient
to
prevent
me
from
starting
for
the
south
as
i
had
intended
over
the
political
horizon
had
long
been
gathering
precursors
of
coming
war
and
early
in
october
of
this
year
the
affair
of
the
lorcha
at
canton
led
to
the
definite
commencement
of
hostilities
very
soon
china
was
deeply
involved
in
a
second
prolonged
struggle
with
foreign
powers
and
missionary
operations
in
the
south
at
any
rate
had
to
be
largely
suspended
tidings
of
these
events
together
with
letters
from
burns
arrived
just
in
time
to
meet
me
in
shanghai
as
i
was
leaving
for
swatow
and
thus
hindered
i
could
not
but
realise
the
hand
of
god
in
closing
the
door
i
had
so
much
desired
to
enter
while
in
ningpo
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
john
jones
who
with
parker
represented
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
in
that
city
hindered
from
returning
to
swatow
i
now
decided
to
join
these
brethren
in
the
ningpo
work
and
set
out
at
once
upon
the
journey
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
when
already
about
thirty
miles
distant
from
shanghai
jones
and
i
drew
near
the
large
and
important
city
of
and
i
spoke
of
going
ashore
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
thronging
multitudes
that
lined
the
banks
and
crowded
the
approaches
to
the
city
gates
among
the
passengers
on
board
the
boat
was
one
intelligent
man
who
in
the
course
of
his
travels
had
been
a
good
deal
abroad
and
had
even
visited
england
where
he
went
by
the
name
of
peter
as
might
be
expected
he
had
heard
something
of
the
gospel
but
had
never
experienced
its
saving
power
on
the
previous
evening
i
had
drawn
him
into
earnest
converse
about
his
soul
salvation
the
man
listened
with
attention
and
was
even
moved
to
tears
but
still
no
definite
result
was
apparent
i
was
pleased
therefore
when
he
asked
to
be
allowed
to
accompany
me
and
to
hear
me
preach
i
went
into
the
cabin
of
the
boat
to
prepare
tracts
and
books
for
distribution
on
landing
with
my
chinese
friend
when
suddenly
i
was
startled
by
a
splash
and
a
cry
from
without
i
sprang
on
deck
and
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
peter
was
gone
the
other
men
were
all
there
on
board
looking
helplessly
at
the
spot
where
he
had
disappeared
but
making
no
effort
to
save
him
a
strong
wind
was
carrying
the
junk
rapidly
forward
in
spite
of
a
steady
current
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
shrubless
shore
afforded
no
landmark
to
indicate
how
far
we
had
left
the
drowning
man
behind
i
instantly
let
down
the
sail
and
leapt
overboard
in
the
hope
of
finding
him
unsuccessful
i
looked
around
in
agonising
suspense
and
saw
close
to
me
a
with
a
peculiar
furnished
with
hooks
which
i
knew
would
bring
him
up
come
i
cried
as
hope
revived
in
my
heart
come
and
drag
over
this
spot
directly
a
man
is
drowning
just
here
veh
bin
it
is
not
convenient
was
the
unfeeling
answer
do
talk
of
cried
i
in
an
agony
a
man
is
drowning
i
tell
you
we
are
busy
fishing
they
responded
and
can
not
come
never
mind
your
fishing
i
said
i
will
give
you
more
money
than
many
a
day
fishing
will
bring
only
come
come
at
once
how
much
money
will
you
give
us
we
can
not
stay
to
discuss
that
now
come
or
it
will
be
too
late
i
will
give
you
five
dollars
then
worth
about
thirty
shillings
in
english
money
we
wo
do
it
for
that
replied
the
men
give
us
twenty
dollars
and
we
will
drag
i
do
not
possess
so
much
do
come
quickly
and
i
will
give
you
all
i
have
how
much
may
that
be
i
do
know
exactly
about
fourteen
dollars
at
last
but
even
then
slowly
enough
the
boat
was
paddled
over
and
the
net
let
down
less
than
a
minute
sufficed
to
bring
up
the
body
of
the
missing
man
the
fishermen
were
clamorous
and
indignant
because
their
exorbitant
demand
was
delayed
while
efforts
at
resuscitation
were
being
made
but
all
was
in
vain
life
was
extinct
to
myself
this
incident
was
profoundly
sad
and
full
of
significance
suggesting
a
far
more
mournful
reality
were
not
those
fishermen
actually
guilty
of
this
poor
chinaman
death
in
that
they
had
the
means
of
saving
him
at
hand
if
they
would
but
have
used
them
assuredly
they
were
guilty
and
yet
let
us
pause
ere
we
pronounce
judgment
against
them
lest
a
greater
than
nathan
answer
art
the
is
it
so
so
wicked
a
thing
to
neglect
to
save
the
body
of
how
much
sorer
punishment
then
is
he
worthy
who
leaves
the
soul
to
perish

may
have
been
its
fittings
the
little
house
was
well
adapted
for
work
amongst
the
people
and
there
i
thankfully
settled
down
finding
ample
scope
for
service
morning
noon
and
night
during
the
latter
part
of
this
year
my
mind
was
greatly
exercised
about
continued
connection
with
my
society
it
being
frequently
in
debt
personally
i
had
always
avoided
debt
and
kept
within
my
salary
though
at
times
only
by
very
careful
economy
now
there
was
no
difficulty
in
doing
this
for
my
income
was
larger
and
the
country
being
in
a
more
peaceful
state
things
were
not
so
dear
but
the
society
itself
was
in
debt
the
quarterly
bills
which
i
and
others
were
instructed
to
draw
were
often
met
by
borrowed
money
and
a
correspondence
commenced
which
terminated
in
the
following
year
by
my
resigning
from
conscientious
motives
to
me
it
seemed
that
the
teaching
of
god
word
was
unmistakably
clear
owe
no
man
any
thing
to
borrow
money
implied
to
my
mind
a
contradiction
of
scripture
a
confession
that
god
had
withheld
some
good
thing
and
a
determination
to
get
for
ourselves
what
he
had
not
given
could
that
which
was
wrong
for
one
christian
to
do
be
right
for
an
association
of
christians
or
could
any
amount
of
precedents
make
a
wrong
course
justifiable
if
the
word
taught
me
anything
it
taught
me
to
have
no
connection
with
debt
i
could
not
think
that
god
was
poor
that
he
was
short
of
resources
or
unwilling
to
supply
any
want
of
whatever
work
was
really
his
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
were
lack
of
funds
to
carry
on
work
then
to
that
degree
in
that
special
development
or
at
that
time
it
could
not
be
the
work
of
god
to
satisfy
my
conscience
i
was
therefore
compelled
to
resign
connection
with
the
society
which
had
hitherto
supplied
my
salary
it
was
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
that
my
friend
and
colleague
jones
also
of
the
chinese
evangelisation
society
was
led
to
take
the
same
step
and
we
were
both
profoundly
thankful
that
the
separation
took
place
without
the
least
breach
of
friendly
feeling
on
either
side
indeed
we
had
the
joy
of
knowing
that
the
step
we
took
commended
itself
to
several
members
of
the
committee
although
as
a
whole
the
society
could
not
come
to
our
position
depending
upon
god
alone
for
supplies
we
were
enabled
to
continue
a
measure
of
connection
with
our
former
supporters
sending
home
journals
for
publication
as
before
so
long
as
the
society
continued
to
exist
the
step
we
had
taken
was
not
a
little
trying
to
faith
i
was
not
at
all
sure
what
god
would
have
me
do
or
whether
he
would
so
meet
my
need
as
to
enable
me
to
continue
working
as
before
i
had
no
friends
whatever
from
whom
i
expected
supplies
i
did
not
know
what
means
the
lord
might
use
but
i
was
willing
to
give
up
all
my
time
to
the
service
of
evangelisation
among
the
heathen
if
by
any
means
he
would
supply
the
smallest
amount
on
which
i
could
live
and
if
he
were
not
pleased
to
do
this
i
was
prepared
to
undertake
whatever
work
might
be
necessary
to
supply
myself
giving
all
the
time
that
could
be
spared
from
such
a
calling
to
more
distinctly
missionary
efforts
but
god
blessed
and
prospered
me
and
how
glad
and
thankful
i
felt
when
the
separation
was
really
effected
i
could
look
right
up
into
my
father
face
with
a
satisfied
heart
ready
by
his
grace
to
do
the
next
thing
as
he
might
teach
me
and
feeling
very
sure
of
his
loving
care
and
how
blessedly
he
did
lead
me
on
and
provide
for
me
i
can
never
never
tell
it
was
like
a
continuation
of
some
of
my
earlier
home
experiences
my
faith
was
not
untried
it
often
often
failed
and
i
was
so
sorry
and
ashamed
of
the
failure
to
trust
such
a
father
but
oh
i
was
learning
to
know
him
i
would
not
even
then
have
missed
the
trial
he
became
so
near
so
real
so
intimate
the
occasional
difficulty
about
funds
never
came
from
an
insufficient
supply
for
personal
needs
but
in
consequence
of
ministering
to
the
wants
of
scores
of
the
hungry
and
dying
ones
around
us
and
trials
far
more
searching
in
other
ways
quite
eclipsed
these
difficulties
and
being
deeper
brought
forth
in
consequence
richer
fruits
how
glad
one
is
now
not
only
to
know
with
dear
miss
havergal
that
they
who
trust
him
wholly
find
him
wholly
true
but
also
that
when
we
fail
to
trust
fully
he
still
remains
unchangingly
faithful
he
wholly
true
whether
we
trust
or
not
if
we
believe
not
he
abideth
faithful
he
can
not
deny
himself
but
oh
how
we
dishonour
our
lord
whenever
we
fail
to
trust
him
and
what
peace
blessing
and
triumph
we
lose
in
thus
sinning
against
the
faithful
one
may
we
never
again
presume
in
anything
to
doubt
him
the
year
was
a
troublous
time
and
closed
with
the
notorious
bombardment
of
canton
by
the
british
and
the
commencement
of
our
second
chinese
war
rumours
of
trouble
were
everywhere
rife
and
in
many
places
the
missionaries
passed
through
not
a
little
danger
in
ningpo
this
was
especially
the
case
and
the
preserving
care
of
god
in
answer
to
prayer
was
consequently
most
marked
when
the
awful
news
of
the
bombardment
of
canton
reached
the
cantonese
in
ningpo
their
wrath
and
indignation
knew
no
bounds
and
they
immediately
set
to
work
to
plot
the
destruction
of
all
the
foreigners
resident
in
the
city
and
neighbourhood
it
was
well
known
that
many
of
the
foreigners
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
for
worship
every
sunday
evening
at
one
of
the
missionary
houses
and
the
plan
was
to
surround
the
place
on
a
given
occasion
and
make
short
work
of
all
present
cutting
off
afterwards
any
who
might
not
be
present
the
sanction
of
the
or
chief
civil
magistrate
of
the
city
was
easily
obtained
and
nothing
remained
to
hinder
the
execution
of
the
plot
of
which
the
foreigners
were
of
course
entirely
in
ignorance
a
similar
plot
against
the
portuguese
a
few
months
later
was
carried
out
and
between
fifty
and
sixty
were
massacred
in
open
daylight
it
so
happened
however
that
one
of
those
acquainted
with
the
conspiracy
had
a
friend
engaged
in
the
service
of
the
missionaries
and
anxious
for
his
safety
he
was
led
to
warn
him
of
the
coming
danger
and
urge
his
leaving
foreign
employ
the
servant
made
the
matter
known
to
his
master
and
thus
the
little
community
became
aware
of
their
peril
realising
the
gravity
of
the
situation
they
determined
to
meet
together
at
the
house
of
one
of
their
number
to
seek
the
protection
of
the
most
high
and
to
hide
under
the
shadow
of
his
wings
nor
did
they
thus
meet
in
vain
at
the
very
time
we
were
praying
the
lord
was
working
he
led
an
inferior
mandarin
the
superintendent
of
customs
to
call
upon
the
and
remonstrate
with
him
upon
the
folly
of
permitting
such
an
attempt
which
he
assured
him
would
rouse
the
foreigners
in
other
places
to
come
with
armed
forces
to
avenge
the
death
of
their
countrymen
and
raze
the
city
to
the
ground
the
replied
that
when
the
foreigners
came
for
that
purpose
he
should
deny
all
knowledge
of
or
complicity
in
the
plot
and
so
direct
their
vengeance
against
the
cantonese
who
would
in
their
turn
be
destroyed
and
thus
said
he
we
shall
get
rid
of
both
cantonese
and
foreigners
by
one
stroke
of
policy
the
superintendent
of
customs
assured
him
that
all
such
attempts
at
evasion
would
be
useless
and
finally
the
sent
to
the
cantonese
withdrawing
his
permission
and
prohibiting
the
attack
this
took
place
at
the
very
time
when
we
were
asking
protection
of
the
lord
though
we
did
not
become
acquainted
with
the
facts
until
some
weeks
later
thus
again
we
were
led
to
prove
that
sufficient
is
his
arm
alone
and
our
defence
is
sure
i
can
not
attempt
to
give
any
historical
record
of
the
events
of
this
period
but
ere
terminated
jones
and
i
were
cheered
by
tokens
of
blessing
it
is
interesting
to
recall
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
first
profession
of
faith
in
christ
which
encouraged
us
on
one
occasion
i
was
preaching
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
through
the
finished
work
of
christ
when
a
man
stood
up
and
testified
before
his
assembled
countrymen
to
his
faith
in
the
power
of
the
gospel
i
have
long
sought
for
the
truth
said
he
earnestly
as
my
fathers
did
before
me
but
i
have
never
found
it
i
have
travelled
far
and
near
but
without
obtaining
it
i
have
found
no
rest
in
confucianism
buddhism
or
taoism
but
i
do
find
rest
in
what
i
have
heard
here
henceforth
i
am
a
believer
in
jesus
this
man
was
one
of
the
leading
officers
of
a
sect
of
reformed
buddhists
in
ningpo
a
short
time
after
his
confession
of
faith
in
the
saviour
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
sect
over
which
he
had
formerly
presided
i
accompanied
him
to
that
meeting
and
there
to
his
former
he
testified
of
the
peace
he
had
obtained
in
believing
soon
after
one
of
his
former
companions
was
converted
and
baptized
both
now
sleep
in
jesus
the
first
of
these
two
long
continued
to
preach
to
his
countrymen
the
glad
tidings
of
great
joy
a
few
nights
after
his
conversion
he
asked
how
long
this
gospel
had
been
known
in
england
he
was
told
that
we
had
known
it
for
some
hundreds
of
years
what
said
he
amazed
is
it
possible
that
for
hundreds
of
years
you
have
had
the
knowledge
of
these
glad
tidings
in
your
possession
and
yet
have
only
now
come
to
preach
it
to
us
my
father
sought
after
the
truth
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
died
without
finding
it
oh
why
did
you
not
come
sooner
a
whole
generation
has
passed
away
since
that
mournful
inquiry
was
made
but
how
many
alas
might
repeat
the
same
question
more
than
two
hundred
millions
in
the
meanwhile
have
been
swept
into
eternity
without
an
offer
of
salvation
how
long
shall
this
continue
and
the
words
to
every
creature
remain
unheeded

our

brings
his
people
into
difficulties
on
purpose
that
they
may
come
to
know
him
as
they
could
not
otherwise
do
then
he
reveals
himself
as
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
and
makes
the
heart
glad
indeed
at
each
fresh
revelation
of
a

faithfulness
we
who
only
see
so
small
a
part
of
the
sweet
issues
of
trial
often
feel
that
we
would
not
for
anything
have
missed
them
how
much
more
shall
we
bless
and
magnify
his
name
when
all
the
hidden
things
are
brought
to
light
in
the
autumn
of
just
one
year
after
i
came
to
settle
in
ningpo
a
little
incident
occurred
that
did
much
to
strengthen
our
faith
in
the
and
care
of
god
a
brother
in
the
lord
the
rev
john
quarterman
of
the
american
presbyterian
mission
north
was
taken
with
virulent
and
it
was
my
mournful
privilege
to
nurse
him
through
his
suffering
illness
to
its
fatal
close
when
all
was
over
it
became
necessary
to
lay
aside
the
garments
worn
while
nursing
for
fear
of
conveying
the
infection
to
others
not
having
sufficient
money
in
hand
to
purchase
what
was
needful
in
order
to
make
this
change
prayer
was
the
only
resource
the
lord
answered
it
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
a
box
of
clothing
from
swatow
that
had
remained
in
the
care
of
the
rev
william
burns
when
i
left
him
for
shanghai
in
the
early
summer
of
the
previous
year
the
arrival
of
the
things
just
at
this
juncture
was
as
appropriate
as
it
was
remarkable
and
brought
a
sweet
sense
of
the
father
own
providing
about
two
months
later
the
following
was
penned
many
seem
to
think
that
i
am
very
poor
this
certainly
is
true
enough
in
one
sense
but
i
thank
god
it
is
as
poor
yet
making
many
rich
as
having
nothing
yet
possessing
all
things
and
my
god
shall
supply
my
need
to
him
be
all
the
glory
i
would
not
if
i
could
be
otherwise
than
i
am
entirely
dependent
myself
upon
the
lord
and
used
as
a
channel
of
help
to
others
on
saturday
the
our
regular
home
mail
arrived
that
morning
we
supplied
as
usual
a
breakfast
to
the
destitute
poor
who
came
to
the
number
of
seventy
sometimes
they
do
not
reach
forty
at
others
again
exceeding
eighty
they
come
to
us
every
day
lord
day
excepted
for
then
we
can
not
manage
to
attend
to
them
and
get
through
all
our
other
duties
too
well
on
that
saturday
morning
we
paid
all
expenses
and
provided
ourselves
for
the
morrow
after
which
we
had
not
a
single
dollar
left
between
us
how
the
lord
was
going
to
provide
for
monday
we
knew
not
but
over
our
mantelpiece
hung
two
scrolls
in
the
chinese
character
hitherto
hath
the
lord
helped
us
and
the
lord
will
provide
and
he
kept
us
from
doubting
for
a
moment
that
very
day
the
mail
came
in
week
sooner
than
was
and
jones
received
a
bill
for
two
hundred
and
fourteen
dollars
we
thanked
god
and
took
courage
the
bill
was
taken
to
a
merchant
and
although
there
is
usually
a
delay
of
several
days
in
getting
the
change
this
time
he
said
send
down
on
monday
we
sent
and
though
he
had
not
been
able
to
buy
all
the
dollars
he
let
us
have
seventy
on
account
so
all
was
well
oh
it
is
sweet
to
live
thus
directly
dependent
upon
the
lord
who
never
fails
us
on
monday
the
poor
had
their
breakfast
as
usual
for
we
had
not
told
them
not
to
come
being
assured
that
it
was
the
lord
work
and
that
the
lord
would
provide
we
could
not
help
our
eyes
filling
with
tears
of
gratitude
when
we
saw
not
only
our
own
needs
supplied
but
the
widow
and
the
orphan
the
blind
and
the
lame
the
friendless
and
the
destitute
together
provided
for
by
the
bounty
of
him
who
feeds
the
ravens
o
magnify
the
lord
with
me
and
let
us
exalt
his
name
together
taste
and
see
that
the
lord
is
good
blessed
is
the
man
that
trusteth
in
him
o
fear
the
lord
ye
his
saints
for
there
is
no
want
to
them
that
fear
him
the
young
lions
do
lack
and
suffer
hunger
but
they
that
seek
the
lord
shall
not
want
any
good
thing
and
if
not
good
why
want
it
but
even
two
hundred
dollars
can
not
last
for
ever
and
by
new
year
day
supplies
were
again
getting
low
at
last
on
january
only
one
solitary
cash
remained
the
twentieth
part
of
a
penny
in
the
joint
possession
of
jones
and
myself
but
though
tried
we
looked
to
god
once
again
to
manifest
his
gracious
care
enough
provision
was
found
in
the
house
to
supply
a
meagre
breakfast
after
which
having
neither
food
for
the
rest
of
the
day
nor
money
to
buy
any
we
could
only
betake
ourselves
to
him
who
was
able
to
supply
all
our
need
with
the
petition
give
us
this
day
our
daily
bread
after
prayer
and
deliberation
we
thought
that
perhaps
we
ought
to
dispose
of
something
we
possessed
in
order
to
meet
our
immediate
requirements
but
on
looking
round
we
saw
nothing
that
we
could
well
spare
and
little
that
the
chinese
would
purchase
for
ready
money
credit
to
any
extent
we
might
have
had
could
we
conscientiously
have
availed
ourselves
of
it
but
this
we
felt
to
be
unscriptural
in
itself
as
well
as
inconsistent
with
the
position
we
were
in
we
had
indeed
one
article
an
iron
stove
which
we
knew
the
chinese
would
readily
purchase
but
we
much
regretted
the
necessity
of
parting
with
it
at
length
however
we
set
out
to
the
founder
and
after
a
walk
of
some
distance
came
to
the
river
which
we
had
intended
to
cross
by
a
floating
bridge
of
boats
but
here
the
lord
shut
up
our
path
the
bridge
had
been
carried
away
during
the
preceding
night
and
the
river
was
only
passable
by
means
of
a
ferry
the
fare
for
which
was
two
cash
each
person
as
we
only
possessed
one
cash
our
course
clearly
was
to
return
and
await
god
own
interposition
on
our
behalf
upon
reaching
home
we
found
that
jones
had
gone
with
the
children
to
dine
at
a
friend
house
in
accordance
with
an
invitation
accepted
some
days
previously
jones
though
himself
included
in
the
invitation
refused
now
to
go
and
leave
me
to
fast
alone
so
we
set
to
work
and
carefully
searched
the
cupboards
and
though
there
was
nothing
to
eat
we
found
a
small
packet
of
cocoa
which
with
a
little
hot
water
somewhat
revived
us
after
this
we
again
cried
to
the
lord
in
our
trouble
and
the
lord
heard
and
saved
us
out
of
all
our
distresses
for
while
we
were
still
upon
our
knees
a
letter
arrived
from
england
containing
a
remittance
this
timely
supply
not
only
met
the
immediate
and
urgent
need
of
the
day
for
in
the
assured
confidence
that
god
whose
we
were
and
whom
we
served
would
not
put
to
shame
those
whose
whole
and
only
trust
was
in
himself
my
marriage
had
been
previously
arranged
to
take
place
just
fourteen
days
after
this
date
and
this
expectation
was
not
disappointed
for
the
mountains
shall
depart
and
the
hills
be
removed
but
my
kindness
shall
not
depart
from
thee
neither
shall
the
covenant
of
my
peace
be
removed
and
although
during
subsequent
years
our
faith
was
often
exercised
and
sometimes
severely
he
ever
proved
faithful
to
his
promise
and
never
suffered
us
to
lack
any
good
thing
never
perhaps
was
there
a
union
that
more
fully
realised
the
blessed
truth
whoso
findeth
a
wife
findeth
a
good
thing
and
obtaineth
favour
of
the
lord
my
dear
wife
was
not
only
a
precious
gift
to
me
god
blessed
her
to
many
others
during
the
twelve
eventful
years
through
which
she
was
spared
to
those
that
loved
her
and
to
china

reached

straits
as
early
as
and
for
sixteen
years
laboured
assiduously
amongst
the
chinese
in

at
the

time
a
valuable
fount
of

the
first
of
the
kind

had
then
been
attempted
dying
in
it
was
never
dyers
privilege
to
realise
his
hopes
of
ultimately
being
able
to
settle
on
chinese
soil
but
his
children
lived
to
see
the
country
opened
to
the
gospel
and
to
take
their
share
in
the
great
work
that
had
been
so
dear
to
his
heart
at
the
time
of
her
marriage

been
already

for
several
years
in

operations

was

qualified
to

god
a
refuge
for
us
a
somewhat
different
though
not
less
manifest
answer
to
prayer
was
vouchsafed
early
in
the
year
my
dear
wife
was
brought
very
low
by
illness
and
at
last
all
hope
of
recovery
seemed
gone
every
remedy
tried
had
proved
unavailing
and
parker
who
was
in
attendance
had
nothing
more
to
suggest
life
was
ebbing
fast
away
the
only
ground
of
hope
was
that
god
might
yet
see
fit
to
raise
her
up
in
answer
to
believing
but
submissive
prayer
the
afternoon
for
the
usual
prayer
meeting
among
the
missionaries
had
arrived
and
i
sent
in
a
request
for
prayer
which
was
most
warmly
responded
to
just
at
this
time
a
remedy
that
had
not
yet
been
tried
was
suggested
to
my
mind
and
i
felt
that
i
must
hasten
to
consult
parker
as
to
the
propriety
of
using
it
it
was
a
moment
of
anguish
the
hollow
temples
sunken
eyes
and
pinched
features
denoted
the
near
approach
of
death
and
it
seemed
more
than
questionable
as
to
whether
life
would
hold
out
until
my
return
it
was
nearly
two
miles
to
parker
house
and
every
moment
appeared
long
on
my
way
thither
while
wrestling
mightily
with
god
in
prayer
the
precious
words
were
brought
with
power
to
my
soul
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shall
glorify
me
i
was
at
once
enabled
to
plead
them
in
faith
and
the
result
was
deep
deep
unspeakable
peace
and
joy
all
consciousness
of
distance
was
gone
parker
cordially
approved
of
the
use
of
the
means
suggested
but
upon
arriving
at
home
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
desired
change
had
taken
place
in
the
absence
of
this
or
any
other
remedy
the
pinched
aspect
of
the
countenance
had
given
place
to
the
calmness
of
tranquil
slumber
and
not
one
unfavourable
symptom
remained
to
retard
recovery
to
health
and
strength
spared
thus
in
answer
to
prayer
the
loss
of
my
own
loved
one
it
was
with
added
sympathy
and
sorrow
that
i
felt
for
parker
when
in
the
autumn
of
the
same
year
his
own
wife
was
very
suddenly
removed
it
being
necessary
for
the
doctor
to
return
at
once
with
his
motherless
children
to
glasgow
temporary
arrangements
had
to
be
made
for
the
conduct
of
the
mission
hospital
in
ningpo
for
which
he
alone
had
been
responsible
under
these
circumstances
he
requested
me
to
take
up
the
work
at
least
so
far
as
the
dispensary
was
concerned
after
a
few
waiting
upon
the
lord
for
guidance
i
felt
constrained
to
undertake
not
only
the
dispensary
work
but
also
that
of
the
hospital
relying
solely
upon
the
faithfulness
of
a
god
to
furnish
the
means
required
for
its
support
the
funds
for
the
maintenance
of
the
hospital
had
hitherto
been
supplied
by
the
proceeds
of
the
doctor
foreign
medical
practice
and
with
his
departure
these
ceased
but
had
not
god
said
that
whatever
we
ask
in
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
shall
be
done
and
are
we
not
told
to
seek
first
the
kingdom
of
god
not
means
to
advance
it
and
that
all
these
things
shall
be
added
to
us
such
promises
were
surely
sufficient
eight
days
before
entering
upon
this
responsibility
i
had
not
the
remotest
idea
of
ever
doing
so
still
less
could
friends
at
home
have
anticipated
it
but
the
lord
had
foreseen
the
need
and
already
funds
were
on
the
way
to
supply
it
at
times
there
were
not
less
than
fifty
in
the
hospital
besides
a
large
number
who
daily
attended
the
department
thirty
beds
were
ordinarily
allotted
to
free
patients
and
their
attendants
and
about
as
many
to
who
paid
for
their
board
while
being
cured
of
the
habit
as
all
the
wants
of
the
sick
in
the
wards
were
supplied
gratuitously
in
addition
to
the
remedial
appliances
needed
for
the
work
the
daily
expenses
were
considerable
besides
which
a
number
of
native
attendants
were
required
involving
their
support
when
parker
handed
the
hospital
over
to
me
he
was
able
to
leave
money
that
would
meet
the
salaries
and
working
expenses
of
the
current
month
and
little
more
being
unable
to
guarantee
their
support
his
native
staff
retired
and
then
i
mentioned
the
circumstances
to
the
members
of
our
little
church
some
of
whom
volunteered
to
help
me
depending
like
myself
upon
the
lord
and
they
with
me
continued
to
wait
upon
god
that
in
some
way
or
other
he
would
provide
for
his
own
work
day
by
day
the
stores
diminished
and
they
were
all
but
exhausted
when
one
day
a
remarkable
letter
reached
me
from
a
friend
in
england
which
contained
a
cheque
for
the
letter
stated
that
the
sender
had
recently
lost
his
father
and
had
inherited
his
property
that
not
desiring
to
increase
his
personal
expenditure
he
wished
to
hold
the
money
which
had
now
been
left
to
him
to
further
the
lord
work
he
enclosed
the
saying
that
i
might
know
of
some
special
need
for
it
but
leaving
me
free
to
use
it
for
my
own
support
or
in
any
way
that
the
lord
might
lead
me
only
asking
to
know
how
it
was
applied
and
whether
there
was
need
for
more
after
a
little
season
of
thanksgiving
with
my
dear
wife
i
called
my
native
helpers
into
our
little
chapel
and
translated
to
them
the
letter
i
need
not
say
how
rejoiced
they
were
and
that
we
together
praised
god
they
returned
to
their
work
in
the
hospital
with
overflowing
hearts
and
told
out
to
the
patients
what
a
god
was
ours
appealing
to
them
whether
their
idols
had
ever
helped
them
so
both
helpers
and
patients
were
blessed
spiritually
through
this
remarkable
provision
and
from
that
time
the
lord
provided
all
that
was
necessary
for
carrying
on
the
institution
in
addition
to
what
was
needed
for
the
maintenance
of
my
own
family
and
for
sustaining
other
branches
of
missionary
work
under
my
care
when
nine
months
later
i
was
obliged
through
failure
of
health
to
relinquish
this
charge
i
was
able
to
leave
more
funds
in
hand
for
the
support
of
the
hospital
than
were
forthcoming
at
the
time
i
undertook
it
but
not
only
were
pecuniary
supplies
vouchsafed
in
answer
to
prayer
many
lives
were
spared
persons
apparently
in
hopeless
stages
of
disease
were
restored
and
success
was
given
in
cases
of
serious
and
dangerous
operations
in
the
case
of
one
poor
man
whose
legs
were
amputated
under
very
unfavourable
circumstances
healthy
action
took
place
with
such
rapidity
that
both
wounds
were
healed
in
less
than
two
weeks
and
more
permanent
benefits
than
these
were
conferred
many
were
convinced
of
the
truth
of
christianity
not
a
few
sought
the
lord
in
faith
and
prayer
and
experienced
the
power
of
the
great
physician
to
cure
the
soul
during
the
nine
months
above
alluded
to
sixteen
patients
from
the
hospital
were
baptized
and
more
than
thirty
others
became
candidates
for
admission
into
one
or
other
of
the
christian
churches
in
the
city
thus
the
year
began
with
openings
on
all
hands
but
time
and
strength
were
sadly
too
limited
to
admit
of
their
being
used
to
the
best
advantage
for
some
time
the
help
of
additional
workers
had
been
a
need
and
in
january
very
definite
prayer
was
made
to
the
lord
of
the
harvest
that
he
would
thrust
forth
more
labourers
into
this
special
portion
of
the
great
writing
to
relatives
at
home
in
england
under
date
of
january
i
thus
expressed
the
deep
longing
of
our
hearts
do
you
know
any
earnest
devoted
young
men
desirous
of
serving
god
in
china
who
not
wishing
for
more
than
their
actual
support
would
be
willing
to
come
out
and
labour
here
oh
for
four
or
five
such
helpers
they
would
probably
begin
to
preach
in
chinese
in
six
months
time
and
in
answer
to
prayer
the
necessary
means
for
their
support
would
be
found
but
no
one
came
to
help
us
then
and
under
the
incessant
physical
and
mental
strain
involved
in
the
care
of
the
hospital
during
absence
as
well
as
the
continued
discharge
of
my
other
missionary
duties
my
own
health
began
rapidly
to
fail
and
it
became
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
it
would
not
be
needful
to
return
to
england
for
a
time
it
was
hard
to
face
this
possibility
the
growing
church
and
work
seemed
to
need
our
presence
and
it
was
no
small
trial
to
part
from
those
whom
we
had
learned
so
truly
to
love
in
the
lord
thirty
or
forty
native
christians
had
been
gathered
into
the
recently
organised
church
and
the
meetings
and
the
earnestness
of
the
converts
all
bespoke
a
future
of
much
promise
at
last
however
completely
prostrated
by
repeated
attacks
of
illness
the
only
hope
of
restoration
seemed
to
lie
in
a
voyage
to
england
and
a
brief
stay
in
its
more
bracing
climate
and
this
necessity
painful
though
it
seemed
at
the
time
proved
to
be
only
another
opportunity
for
the
manifestation
of
the
faithfulness
and
loving
care
of
him
who
worketh
all
things
after
the
counsel
of
his
own
will
as
heretofore
the
lord
was
present
with
his
aid
the
means
for
our
journey
were
supplied
and
that
so
liberally
that
we
were
able
to
bring
with
us
a
native
christian
to
assist
in
translation
or
other
literary
work
and
to
instruct
in
the
language
such
helpers
as
the
lord
might
raise
up
for
the
extension
of
the
mission
that
he
would
give
us
we
had
no
doubt
for
we
had
been
enabled
to
seek
them
from
him
in
earnest
and
believing
prayer
for
many
months
previously
the
day
before
leaving
china
we
wrote
as
follows
to
our
friend
berger
whom
we
had
known
in
england
and
who
had
ever
strengthened
our
hands
in
the
lord
while
in
that
distant
land
we
are
bringing
with
us
a
young
chinese
brother
to
assist
in
literary
work
and
i
hope
also
in
teaching
the
dialect
to
those
whom
the
lord
may
induce
to
return
with
us
and
throughout
the
voyage
our
earnest
cry
to
god
was
that
he
would
overrule
our
stay
at
home
for
good
to
china
and
make
it
instrumental
in
raising
up
at
least
five
helpers
to
labour
in
the
province
of
the
way
in
which
it
pleased
the
lord
to
answer
these
earnest
and
believing
prayers
and
the
exceeding
abundantly
with
which
he
crowned
them
we
shall
now
sketch
in
brief
outline
illustration
chapter
xviii
a
new
agency
needed
my
thoughts
are
not
your
thoughts
neither
are
your
ways
my
ways
saith
the
lord
for
as
the
heavens
are
higher
than
the
earth
so
are
my
ways
higher
than
your
ways
and
my
thoughts
than
your
thoughts
how
true
are
these
words
when
the
lord
is
bringing
in
great
blessing
in
the
best
possible
way
how
oftentimes
our
unbelieving
hearts
are
feeling
if
not
saying
like
jacob
of
old
all
these
things
are
against
me
or
we
are
filled
with
fear
as
were
the
disciples
when
the
lord
walking
on
the
waters
drew
near
to
quiet
the
troubled
sea
and
to
bring
them
quickly
to
their
desired
haven
and
yet
mere
ought
to
tell
us
that
he
whose
way
is
perfect
make
no
mistakes
that
he
who
has
promised
to
perfect
that
which
concerneth
us
and
whose
minute
care
counts
the
very
hairs
of
our
heads
and
forms
for
us
our
circumstances
know
better
than
we
the
way
to
forward
our
truest
interests
and
to
glorify
his
own
name
blind
unbelief
is
to
err
and
scan
his
work
in
vain
god
is
his
own
interpreter
and
he
will
make
it
plain
to
me
it
seemed
a
great
calamity
that
failure
of
health
compelled
my
relinquishing
work
for
god
in
china
just
when
it
was
more
fruitful
than
ever
before
and
to
leave
the
little
band
of
christians
in
ningpo
needing
much
care
and
teaching
was
a
great
sorrow
nor
was
the
sorrow
lessened
when
on
reaching
england
medical
testimony
assured
me
that
return
to
china
at
least
for
years
to
come
was
impossible
little
did
i
then
realise
that
the
long
separation
from
china
was
a
necessary
step
towards
the
formation
of
a
work
which
god
would
bless
as
he
has
blessed
the
china
inland
mission
while
in
the
field
the
pressure
of
claims
immediately
around
me
was
so
great
that
i
could
not
think
much
of
the
still
greater
needs
of
the
regions
farther
inland
and
if
they
were
thought
of
could
do
nothing
for
them
but
while
detained
for
some
years
in
england
daily
viewing
the
whole
country
on
the
large
map
on
the
wall
of
my
study
i
was
as
near
to
the
vast
regions
of
inland
china
as
to
the
smaller
districts
in
which
i
had
laboured
personally
for
god
and
prayer
was
often
the
only
resource
by
which
the
burdened
heart
could
gain
any
relief
as
a
long
absence
from
china
appeared
inevitable
the
next
question
was
how
best
to
serve
china
while
in
england
and
this
led
to
my
engaging
for
several
years
with
the
late
rev
gough
of
the
in
the
revision
of
a
version
of
the
new
testament
in
the
colloquial
of
ningpo
for
the
british
and
foreign
bible
society
in
undertaking
this
work
in
my
i
saw
nothing
beyond
the
use
that
the
book
and
the
marginal
references
would
be
to
the
native
christians
but
i
have
often
seen
since
that
without
those
months
of
feeding
and
feasting
on
the
word
of
god
i
should
have
been
quite
unprepared
to
form
on
its
present
basis
a
mission
like
the
china
inland
mission
in
the
study
of
that
divine
word
i
learned
that
to
obtain
successful
labourers
not
elaborate
appeals
for
help
but
earnest
to
god
to
thrust
forth
and
the
deepening
of
the
spiritual
life
of
the
church
so
that
should
be
unable
to
stay
at
were
what
was
needed
i
saw
that
the
apostolic
plan
was
not
to
raise
ways
and
means
but
go
and
do
the
trusting
in
his
sure
word
who
has
said
seek
ye
the
kingdom
of
god
and
his
righteousness
and
all
these
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
in
the
meantime
the
prayer
for
workers
for
was
being
answered
the
first
meadows
sailed
for
china
with
his
young
wife
in
january
through
the
kind
and
aid
of
our
friend
berger
the
second
left
england
in
having
her
passage
provided
by
the
foreign
evangelisation
society
the
third
and
fourth
reached
ningpo
on
july
a
fifth
soon
followed
them
reaching
ningpo
in
september
thus
the
prayer
for
the
five
workers
was
fully
answered
and
we
were
encouraged
to
look
to
god
for
still
greater
things
months
of
earnest
prayer
and
not
a
few
abortive
efforts
had
resulted
in
a
deep
conviction
that
special
agency
was
for
the
evangelisation
of
inland
china
at
this
time
i
had
not
only
the
daily
help
of
prayer
and
conference
with
my
beloved
friend
and
the
late
rev
gough
but
also
invaluable
aid
and
counsel
from
and
berger
with
whom
i
and
my
dear
wife
whose
judgment
and
piety
were
of
priceless
value
at
this
juncture
spent
many
days
in
prayerful
deliberation
the
grave
difficulty
of
possibly
interfering
with
existing
missionary
operations
at
home
was
foreseen
but
it
was
concluded
that
by
simple
trust
in
god
suitable
agency
might
be
raised
up
and
sustained
without
interfering
injuriously
with
any
existing
work
i
had
also
a
growing
conviction
that
god
would
have
to
seek
from
him
the
needed
workers
and
to
go
forth
with
them
but
for
a
long
time
unbelief
hindered
my
taking
the
first
step
how
inconsistent
unbelief
always
is
i
had
no
doubt
that
if
i
prayed
for
workers
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
christ
they
would
be
given
me
i
had
no
doubt
that
in
answer
to
such
prayer
the
means
for
our
going
forth
would
be
provided
and
that
doors
would
be
opened
before
us
in
unreached
parts
of
the
empire
but
i
had
not
then
learned
to
trust
god
for
power
and
grace
for
myself
so
no
wonder
that
i
could
not
trust
him
to
keep
others
who
might
be
prepared
to
go
with
me
i
feared
that
in
the
midst
of
the
dangers
difficulties
and
trials
which
would
necessarily
be
connected
with
such
a
work
some
who
were
comparatively
inexperienced
christians
might
break
down
and
bitterly
reproach
me
for
having
encouraged
them
to
undertake
an
enterprise
for
which
they
were
unequal
yet
what
was
i
to
do
the
feeling
of
became
more
and
more
intense
simply
because
i
refused
to
ask
for
them
the
labourers
did
not
come
forward
did
not
go
out
to
china
and
every
day
tens
of
thousands
were
passing
away
to
christless
graves
perishing
china
so
filled
my
heart
and
mind
that
there
was
no
rest
by
day
and
little
sleep
by
night
till
health
broke
down
at
the
invitation
of
my
beloved
and
honoured
friend
george
pearse
then
of
the
stock
exchange
i
went
to
spend
a
few
days
with
him
in
brighton
on
sunday
june
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
a
congregation
of
a
thousand
or
more
christian
people
rejoicing
in
their
own
security
while
millions
were
perishing
for
lack
of
knowledge
i
wandered
out
on
the
sands
alone
in
great
spiritual
agony
and
there
the
lord
conquered
my
unbelief
and
i
surrendered
myself
to
god
for
this
service
i
told
him
that
all
the
responsibility
as
to
issues
and
consequences
must
rest
with
him
that
as
his
servant
it
was
mine
to
obey
and
to
follow
him
his
to
direct
to
care
for
and
to
guide
me
and
those
who
might
labour
with
me
need
i
say
that
peace
at
once
flowed
into
my
burdened
heart
there
and
then
i
asked
him
for
two
for
each
of
eleven
inland
provinces
which
were
without
a
missionary
and
two
for
mongolia
and
writing
the
petition
on
the
margin
of
the
bible
i
had
with
me
i
returned
home
with
a
heart
enjoying
rest
such
as
it
had
been
a
stranger
to
for
months
and
with
an
assurance
that
the
lord
would
bless
his
own
work
and
that
i
should
share
in
the
blessing
i
had
previously
prayed
and
asked
prayer
that
workers
might
be
raised
up
for
the
eleven
then
unoccupied
provinces
and
thrust
forth
and
provided
for
but
had
not
surrendered
myself
to
be
their
leader
about
this
time
with
the
help
of
my
dear
wife
i
wrote
the
little
book
spiritual
need
and
every
paragraph
was
steeped
in
prayer
with
the
help
of
berger
who
had
given
valued
aid
in
the
revision
of
the
manuscript
and
who
bore
the
expense
of
printing
an
edition
of
copies
they
were
soon
put
in
circulation
i
spoke
publicly
of
the
proposed
work
as
opportunity
permitted
specially
at
the
perth
and
mildmay
conferences
of
and
continued
in
prayer
for
who
were
soon
raised
up
and
after
due
correspondence
were
invited
to
my
home
then
in
the
east
of
london
when
one
house
became
insufficient
the
occupant
of
the
adjoining
house
removed
and
i
was
able
to
rent
it
and
when
that
in
its
turn
became
insufficient
further
accommodation
was
provided
close
by
soon
there
were
a
number
of
men
and
women
under
preparatory
training
and
engaging
in
evangelistic
work

some
measure

qualifications

undertook
the

department
of
the
work
during
my
anticipated
absence
in

and
i
proposed
as
soon
as
arrangements
could
be
completed
to
go
out
with
the
volunteers
and
take
the
direction
of
the
work
in
the
field
for
the
support
of
the
workers
already
in
china
our
friends
at
home
were
sending
in
unsolicited
contributions
from
time
to
time
and
every
need
was
met
we
had
now
however
to
look
forward
to
the
outgoing
of
a
party
of
sixteen
or
seventeen
and
estimated
that
from
to
might
be
required
to
cover
outfits
and
initial
expenses
i
wrote
a
little
pamphlet
calling
it
occasional

no
i
intending
in
successive
numbers
to
give
to
donors
and
friends
accounts
of
the
work
wrought
through
us
in
china
and
in
that
paper
stated
the
anticipated
needs
for
floating
the
enterprise
i
expected
that
god
would
incline
the
hearts
of
some
of
the
readers
to
send
contributions
i
had
determined
never
to
use
personal
solicitation
or
to
make
collections
or
to
issue
were
thought
unobjectionable
and
we
had
a
few
prepared
for
those
who
might
ask
for
them
and
have
continued
to
use
them
ever
since
it
was
february
when
i
sent
my
manuscript
of
occasional
paper
no
with
a
design
for
the
cover
to
the
printer
from
delays
in
engraving
and
printing
it
was

when
the
bales
of

were
delivered
at

house
now
on

a

occurred
the
of
the
occasional

no
i
was
not
completed
till
february
up
to
this
time
we
had
received
from
december
we
felt
much
encouraged
by
the
receipt
of
so
much
money
in
little
more
than
a
month
as
it
was
entirely
unsolicited
by
us
save
from
god
but
it
was
also
evident
that
we
must
ask
the
lord
to
do
yet
greater
things
for
us
or
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
party
of
from
ten
to
sixteen
to
leave
in
the
middle
of
may
united
prayer
was
therefore
offered
god
for
the
funds
needful
for
the

and
passages
of
as
many
as
he
would
have
to
go
out
in
may
owing
to
the
delays
mentioned
above
in
the
printing
of
the
paper
it
was
not
ready
for
the
publisher
until
march
on
this
day
i
again
examined
my
mission
and
the
comparison
of
the
result
of
the
two
similar
periods
of
one
month
and
six
days
each
one
before
and
one
after
special
prayer
for
to
was
very
striking

december
to
february

received
this
it
will
be
noticed
was
to
the
circulation
of
the
paper
and
consequently
was
not
the
result
of
it
it
was
the
response
of
a
faithful
god
to
the
united
prayers
of
those
whom
he
had
called
to
serve
him
in
the
gospel
of
his
dear
son
we
can
now
compare
with
these
two
periods
a
third
of
the
same
extent
from
march
to
april
the
receipts
were
showing
that
when
god
had
supplied
the
special
need
the
special
supply
also
ceased
truly
there
is
a
living
god
and
he
is
the
hearer
and
answerer
of
prayer
but
this
gracious
answer
to
prayer
made
it
a
little
difficult
to
circulate
occasional
paper
no
for
it
stated
as
a
need
that
which
was
already
supplied
the
difficulty
was
obviated
by
the
issue
with
each
copy
of
a
coloured
inset
stating
that
the
funds
for
outfit
and
passage
were
already
in
hand
in
answer
to
prayer
we
were
reminded
of
the
difficulty
of
moses
not
a
very
common
one
in
the
present
day
and
of
the
proclamation
he
had
to
send
through
the
camp
to
the
people
to
prepare
no
more
for
the
building
of
the
tabernacle
as
the
gifts
in
hand
were
already
too
much
we
are
convinced
that
if
there
were
solicitation
for
money
and
dependence
upon
the
power
of
the
holy
ghost
and
upon
the
deepening
of
spiritual
life
the
experience
of
moses
would
be
a
common
one
in
every
branch
of
christian
work
preparations
for
sailing
to
china
were
at
once
proceeded
with
about
this
time
i
was
asked
to
give
a
lecture
on
china
in
a
village
not
very
far
from
london
and
agreed
to
do
so
on
condition
that
there
should
be
no
collection
and
that
this
should
be
announced
on
the
bills
the
gentleman
who
invited
me
and
who
kindly
presided
as
chairman
said
he
had
never
had
that
condition
imposed
before
he
accepted
it
however
and
the
bills
were
issued
accordingly
for
the
or
of
may
with
the
aid
of
a
large
map
something
of
the
extent
and
population
and
deep
spiritual
need
of
china
was
presented
and
many
were
evidently
impressed
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
the
chairman
said
that
by
my
request
it
had
been
intimated
on
the
bills
that
there
would
be
no
collection
but
he
felt
that
many
present
would
be
distressed
and
burdened
if
they
had
not
the
opportunity
of
contributing
something
towards
the
good
work
proposed
he
trusted
that
as
the
proposition
emanated
entirely
from
himself
and
expressed
he
felt
sure
the
feelings
of
many
in
the
audience
i
should
not
object
to
it
i
begged
however
that
the
condition
agreed
to
might
be
carried
out
pointing
out
among
other
reasons
for
making
no
collection
that
the
very
reason
adduced
by
our
kind
chairman
was
to
my
mind
one
of
the
strongest
for
not
making
it
my
wish
was
not
that
those
present
should
be
relieved
by
making
such
contribution
as
might
there
and
then
be
convenient
under
the
influence
of
a
present
emotion
but
that
each
one
should
go
home
burdened
with
the
deep
need
of
china
and
ask
of
god
what
he
would
have
them
to
do
if
after
thought
and
prayer
they
were
satisfied
that
a
pecuniary
contribution
was
what
he
wanted
of
them
it
could
be
given
to
any
missionary
society
having
agents
in
china
or
it
might
be
posted
to
our
london
office
but
that
perhaps
in
many
cases
what
god
wanted
was
a
money
contribution
but
personal
consecration
to
his
service
abroad
or
the
giving
up
of
son
or
daughter
more
precious
than
silver
or
gold
to
his
service
i
added
that
i
thought
the
tendency
of
a
collection
was
to
leave
the
impression
that
the
thing
was
whereas
no
amount
of
money
could
convert
a
single
soul
that
what
was
needed
was
that
men
and
women
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
should
give
to
the
work
for
the
support
of
such
there
would
never
be
a
lack
of
funds
as
my
wish
was
evidently
very
strong
the
chairman
kindly
yielded
to
it
and
closed
the
meeting
he
told
me
however
at
the
that
he
thought
it
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
and
that
notwithstanding
all
i
had
said
a
few
persons
had
put
some
little
contributions
into
his
hands
next
morning
at
breakfast
my
kind
host
came
in
a
little
late
and
acknowledged
to
not
having
had
a
very
good
night
after
breakfast
he
asked
me
to
his
study
and
giving
me
the
contributions
handed
to
him
the
night
before
said
i
thought
last
night
taylor
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
about
a
collection
i
am
now
convinced
you
were
quite
right
as
i
thought
in
the
night
of
that
stream
of
souls
in
china
ever
passing
onward
into
the
dark
i
could
only
cry
as
you
suggested
what
wilt
thou
have
to
do
i
think
i
have
obtained
the
guidance
i
sought
and
here
it
is
he
handed
me
a
cheque
for
adding
that
if
there
had
been
a
collection
he
would
have
given
a
few
pounds
to
it
but
now
this
cheque
was
the
result
of
having
spent
no
small
part
of
the
night
in
prayer
i
need
scarcely
say
how
surprised
and
thankful
i
was
for
this
gift
i
had
received
at
the
a
letter
from
killick
martin
and
shipping
agents
in
which
they
stated
that
they
could
offer
us
the
whole
passenger
accommodation
of
the
ship
i
went
direct
to
the
ship
found
it
in
every
way
suitable
and
paid
the
cheque
on
account
as
above
stated
the
funds
deemed
needed
had
been
already
in
hand
for
some
time
but
the
coincidence
of
the
simultaneous
offer
of
the
ship
accommodation
and
this
munificent
gift
exceeding
abundantly
greatly
encouraged
my
heart
on
the
of
may
we
sailed
for
china

two
years
later
in

a

the
assistance
of
the
educational
and
other
advantages
of
the
and
who
work
under
its

the
staff
of
the
mission
in

consisted
of

including
wives
and
associates
there
were
also
native
helpers
of
whom
were
unpaid
working
as
pastors
evangelists
teachers
colporteurs
in
different
provinces
duly
qualified
candidates
for
missionary
labour
are
accepted
without
restriction
as
to
denomination
provided
they
are
sound
in
the
faith
in
all
fundamental
truths
these
go
out
in
dependence
upon
god
for
temporal
supplies
with
the
clear
understanding
that
the
officers
of
the
mission
do
not
guarantee
any
income
whatever
and
knowing
that
as
they
will
not
go
into
debt
they
can
only
minister
to
them
as
the
funds
sent
in
from
time
to
time
will
allow
but
we
praise
god
that
during
the
past
years
such
ministry
has
always
been
possible
our
god
supplied
all
our
need
and
has
withheld
no
good
thing
all
the
expenses
of
the
mission
at
home
and
abroad
are
met
by
voluntary
contributions
sent
to
the
offices
of
the
mission
without
personal
solicitation
by
those
who
wish
to
aid
in
this
effort
to
spread
the
knowledge
of
the
gospel
throughout
china
the
income
for
the
year
was
about
from
all
sources
great
britain
the
continent
of
europe
north
america
australasia
china
etc
some
of
the
missionaries
having
private
property
have
gone
out
at
their
own
expense
and
do
not
take
anything
from
the
mission
funds
stations
have
been
opened
in
ten
of
the
eleven
provinces
which
were
previously
without
protestant
missionaries
from
one
of
these
however
we
have
had
to
retire
the
eleventh
province
has
been
visited
several
times
and
it
is
hoped
that
in
it
permanent
work
may
soon
be
begun
more
than
stations
and
have
been
opened
in
fourteen
of
the
eighteen
provinces
in
all
of
which
stations
either
missionaries
or
native
labourers
are
resident
over
converts
have
been
baptized
from
the
commencement
some
of
whom
are
now
living
and
in
fellowship
the
mission
in
the
year
in
which
the
first
edition
of
appeared
was
marked
by
the
erection
of
large
and
commodious
premises
for
the
work
of
the
mission
and
early
in
the
following
year
the
houses
in
pyrland
road
which
had
so
long
formed
the
home
of
the
mission
in
england
were
vacated
and
newington
green
london
became
the
address
of
the
mission
offices
and
home
from
that
date
until
the
boxer
outbreak
of
the
mission
made
steady
progress
the
development
of
the
work
in
china
being
accompanied
by
corresponding
developments
in
the
home
departments
of
the
mission
in
england
america
and
australasia
in
january
before
the
boxer
outbreak
there
were
in
connection
with
the
mission
missionaries
including
wives
and
associates
stations
chapels
paid
native
helpers
unpaid
native

communicants
in

having
been
baptized
from
the
commencement
there
were
organised
churches
boarding
scholars
day
scholars
hospitals
dispensaries
and
opium

during
the
terrible
year
of
when
no
fewer
than
missionaries
and
missionaries
children
and
many
thousands
of
chinese
christians
were
cruelly
murdered
the
china
inland
mission
lost
missionaries
and
children
the
records
of
these
unparalleled
times
of
suffering
have
been
told
in
missionaries
of
the
china
inland
and
in
both
of
which
books
will
be
found
advertised
at
the
end
of
this
volume
apart
from
loss
of
life
there
was
an
immense
amount
of
mission
property
destroyed
and
the
missionaries
were
compelled
to
retire
from
their
stations
in
most
parts
of
china
the
doors
closed
by
this
outbreak
have
all
been
reopened
in
the
goodness
of
god
in
those
districts
which
suffered
most
from
the
massacres
the
work
has
largely
been
one
of
reorganisation
but
throughout
china
generally
there
has
been
a
spirit
of
awakening
and
a
time
of
enlarged
opportunity
which
is
a
loud
call
for
more
men
and
women
to
volunteer
to
step
into
the
gaps
and
fill
the
places
of
those
who
have
fallen

recent
developments
