the
man
of
the
forest

chapter
i
at
sunset
hour
the
forest
was
still
lonely
sweet
with
tang
of
fir
and
spruce
blazing
in
gold
and
red
and
green
and
the
man
who
glided
on
under
the
great
trees
seemed
to
blend
with
the
colors
and
disappearing
to
have
become
a
part
of
the
wild
woodland
old
baldy
highest
of
the
white
mountains
stood
up
round
and
bare
rimmed
bright
gold
in
the
last
glow
of
the
setting
sun
then
as
the
fire
dropped
behind
the
domed
peak
a
change
a
cold
and
darkening
blight
passed
down
the
black
slopes
over
all
that
mountain
world
it
was
a
wild
richly
timbered
and
abundantly
watered
region
of
dark
forests
and
grassy
parks
ten
thousand
feet
above
isolated
on
all
sides
by
the
southern
arizona
desert
the
virgin
home
of
elk
and
deer
of
bear
and
lion
of
wolf
and
fox
and
the
birthplace
as
well
as
the
of
the
fierce
apache
september
in
that
latitude
was
marked
by
the
sudden
cool
night
breeze
following
shortly
after
sundown
twilight
appeared
to
come
on
its
wings
as
did
faint
sounds
not
distinguishable
before
in
the
stillness
milt
dale
man
of
the
forest
halted
at
the
edge
of
a
timbered
ridge
to
listen
and
to
watch
beneath
him
lay
a
narrow
valley
open
and
grassy
from
which
rose
a
faint
murmur
of
running
water
its
music
was
pierced
by
the
wild
staccato
yelp
of
a
hunting
coyote
from
overhead
in
the
giant
fir
came
a
twittering
and
rustling
of
grouse
settling
for
the
night
and
from
across
the
valley
drifted
the
last
low
calls
of
wild
turkeys
going
to
roost
to
dale
keen
ear
these
sounds
were
all
they
should
have
been
betokening
an
unchanged
serenity
of
forestland
he
was
glad
for
he
had
expected
to
hear
the
clipclop
of
white
men
horses
which
to
hear
up
in
those
fastnesses
was
hateful
to
him
he
and
the
indian
were
friends
that
fierce
foe
had
no
enmity
toward
the
lone
hunter
but
there
hid
somewhere
in
the
forest
a
gang
of
bad
men
whom
dale
did
not
want
to
meet
as
he
started
out
upon
the
slope
a
sudden
flaring
of
the
afterglow
of
sunset
flooded
down
from
old
baldy
filling
the
valley
with
lights
and
shadows
yellow
and
blue
like
the
radiance
of
the
sky
the
pools
in
the
curves
of
the
brook
shone
darkly
bright
dale
gaze
swept
up
and
down
the
valley
and
then
tried
to
pierce
the
black
shadows
across
the
brook
where
the
wall
of
spruce
stood
up
its
speared
and
spiked
crest
against
the
pale
clouds
the
wind
began
to
moan
in
the
trees
and
there
was
a
feeling
of
rain
in
the
air
dale
striking
a
trail
turned
his
back
to
the
fading
afterglow
and
strode
down
the
valley
with
night
at
hand
and
a
brewing
he
did
not
head
for
his
own
camp
some
miles
distant
but
directed
his
steps
toward
an
old
log
cabin
when
he
reached
it
darkness
had
almost
set
in
he
approached
with
caution
this
cabin
like
the
few
others
scattered
in
the
valleys
might
harbor
indians
or
a
bear
or
a
panther
nothing
however
appeared
to
be
there
then
dale
studied
the
clouds
driving
across
the
sky
and
he
felt
the
cool
dampness
of
a
fine
misty
rain
on
his
face
it
would
rain
off
and
on
during
the
night
whereupon
he
entered
the
cabin
and
the
next
moment
he
heard
quick
of
trotting
horses
peering
out
he
saw
dim
moving
forms
in
the
darkness
quite
close
at
hand
they
had
approached
against
the
wind
so
that
sound
had
been
deadened
five
horses
with
riders
dale
made
out
saw
them
loom
close
then
he
heard
rough
voices
quickly
he
turned
to
feel
in
the
dark
for
a
ladder
he
knew
led
to
a
loft
and
finding
it
he
quickly
mounted
taking
care
not
to
make
a
noise
with
his
rifle
and
lay
down
upon
the
floor
of
brush
and
poles
scarcely
had
he
done
so
when
heavy
steps
with
accompaniment
of
clinking
spurs
passed
through
the
door
below
into
the
cabin
wal
beasley
are
you
here
queried
a
loud
voice
there
was
no
reply
the
man
below
growled
under
his
breath
and
again
the
spurs
jingled
fellars
beasley
ai
here
yet
he
called
put
the
hosses
under
the
shed
we
wait
huh
came
a
harsh
reply
mebbe
all
night
an
we
got
nuthin
to
shut
up
moze
reckon
you
no
good
for
anythin
but
eatin
put
them
hosses
away
an
some
of
you
rustle
in
low
muttered
curses
then
mingled
with
dull
thuds
of
hoofs
and
strain
of
leather
and
heaves
of
tired
horses
another
shuffling
clinking
footstep
entered
the
cabin
snake
it
been
sense
to
fetch
a
pack
along
drawled
this
newcomer
reckon
so
jim
but
we
did
an
what
the
use
hollerin
beasley
wo
keep
us
waitin
dale
lying
still
and
prone
felt
a
slow
start
in
all
his
blood
a
thrilling
wave
that
man
below
was
snake
anson
the
worst
and
most
dangerous
character
of
the
region
and
the
others
undoubtedly
composed
his
gang
long
notorious
in
that
sparsely
settled
country
and
the
beasley
mentioned
he
was
one
of
the
two
biggest
ranchers
and
of
the
white
mountain
ranges
what
was
the
meaning
of
a
rendezvous
between
snake
anson
and
beasley
milt
dale
answered
that
question
to
beasley
discredit
and
many
strange
matters
pertaining
to
sheep
and
herders
always
a
mystery
to
the
little
village
of
pine
now
became
as
clear
as
daylight
other
men
entered
the
cabin
it
ai
to
rain
much
said
one
then
came
a
crash
of
wood
thrown
to
the
ground
jim
hyar
a
chunk
of
pine
log
dry
as
punk
said
another
rustlings
and
slow
footsteps
and
then
heavy
thuds
attested
to
the
probability
that
jim
was
knocking
the
end
of
a
log
upon
the
ground
to
split
off
a
corner
whereby
a
handful
of
dry
splinters
could
be
procured
snake

replied
snake
reckon
you
the
meanest
cuss
in
these
woods
drawled
jim
sharp
click
of
steel
on
flint
many
times
and
then
a
sound
of
hard
blowing
and
sputtering
told
of
jim
efforts
to
start
a
fire
presently
the
pitchy
blackness
of
the
cabin
changed
there
came
a
little
crackling
of
wood
and
the
rustle
of
flame
and
then
a
steady
growing
roar
as
it
chanced
dale
lay
face
down
upon
the
floor
of
the
loft
and
right
near
his
eyes
there
were
cracks
between
the
boughs
when
the
fire
blazed
up
he
was
fairly
well
able
to
see
the
men
below
the
only
one
he
had
ever
seen
was
jim
wilson
who
had
been
well
known
at
pine
before
snake
anson
had
ever
been
heard
of
jim
was
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
and
he
had
friends
among
the
honest
people
it
was
rumored
that
he
and
snake
did
not
pull
well
together

shuffled
out
with
alacrity
in
the
firelight
snake
anson
face
looked
lean
and
his
eyes
glittered
and
his
long
neck
and
all
of
his
long
length
carried
out
the
analogy
of
his
name
snake
what

here

thoughtful

of

queried
the
youngest
of
the
gang
a
boy
in
years
whose
hard
bitter
lips
and
hungry
eyes
somehow
set
him
apart
from
his
comrades

the
man

at
the
juncture

up

trail
he
said
snake
rose
and
stood
at
the
door
listening
outside
the
wind
moaned
fitfully
and
scattering
raindrops
pattered
upon
the
cabin
exclaimed
snake
in
relief
silence
ensued
then
for
a
moment
at
the
end
of
which
interval
dale
heard
a
rapid
on
the
rocky
trail
outside
the
men
below
shuffled
uneasily
but
none
of
them
spoke
the
fire
cracked
cheerily
snake
anson
stepped
back
from
before
the
door
with
an
action
that
expressed
both
doubt
and
caution
the
trotting
horse
had
halted
out
there
somewhere
ho

inside
called
a
voice
from
the
darkness

anson

query

so
returned
anson
showing
himself
the
newcomer
entered
he
was
a
large
man
wearing
a
slicker
that
shone
wet
in
the
firelight
his
sombrero
pulled
well
down
shadowed
his
face
so
that
the
upper
half
of
his
features
might
as
well
have
been
masked
he
had
a
black
drooping
mustache
and
a
chin
like
a
rock
a
potential
force
matured
and
powerful
seemed
to
be
wrapped
in
his
movements

indicated
with
a
significant
gesture
that
snake

abruptly

he
paused
to
draw
a
deep
breath
and
his
big
hands
trembled
over
the
blaze
anson
leaned
forward
like
a
serpent
ready
to
strike
and
jim
wilson
was
as
tense
with
his
divination
of
the
plot
at

hands
once
more
over
the
blaze
pulled
on
his
gloves
and
pulled
down
his
sombrero
and
with
an
abrupt
word
of
parting
strode
out
into
the
night
jim

anson
pard

ways

replied
wilson
wal
let
get
back
to
and
he
led
the
way
out
low
voices
drifted
into
the
cabin
then
came
snorts
of
horses
and
striking
hoofs
and
after
that
a
steady
trot
gradually
ceasing
once
more
the
moan
of
wind
and
soft
patter
of
rain
filled
the
forest
stillness
chapter
ii
milt
dale
quietly
sat
up
to
gaze
with
thoughtful
eyes
into
the
gloom
he
was
thirty
years
old
as
a
boy
of
fourteen
he
had
run
off
from
his
school
and
home
in
iowa
and
joining
a
of
pioneers
he
was
one
of
the
first
to
see
log
cabins
built
on
the
slopes
of
the
white
mountains
but
he
had
not
taken
kindly
to
farming
or
or
monotonous
home
toil
and
for
twelve
years
he
had
lived
in
the
forest
with
only
infrequent
visits
to
pine
and
show
down
and
snowdrop
this
wandering
forest
life
of
his
did
not
indicate
that
he
did
not
care
for
the
villagers
for
he
did
care
and
he
was
welcome
everywhere
but
that
he
loved
wild
life
and
solitude
and
beauty
with
the
primitive
instinctive
force
of
a
savage
and
on
this
night
he
had
stumbled
upon
a
dark
plot
against
the
only
one
of
all
the
honest
white
people
in
that
region
whom
he
could
not
call
a
friend
that
man
beasley
he
soliloquized
beasley
in
cahoots
with
snake
anson
well
he
was
right
al
auchincloss
is
on
his
last
legs
poor
old
man
when
i
tell
him
he
never
believe
me
that
sure
discovery
of
the
plot
meant
to
dale
that
he
must
hurry
down
to
pine
a
girl
helen
rayner
twenty
years
old
he
mused
beasley
wants
her
made
off
with
that
means
worse
than
killed
dale
accepted
facts
of
life
with
that
equanimity
and
fatality
acquired
by
one
long
versed
in
the
cruel
annals
of
forest
lore
bad
men
worked
their
evil
just
as
savage
wolves
relayed
a
deer
he
had
shot
wolves
for
that
trick
with
men
good
or
bad
he
had
not
clashed
old
women
and
children
appealed
to
him
but
he
had
never
had
any
interest
in
girls
the
image
then
of
this
helen
rayner
came
strangely
to
dale
and
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
meant
somehow
to
circumvent
beasley
not
to
befriend
old
al
auchincloss
but
for
the
sake
of
the
girl
probably
she
was
already
on
her
way
west
alone
eager
hopeful
of
a
future
home
how
little
people
guessed
what
awaited
them
at
a
journey
end
many
trails
ended
abruptly
in
the
forest
and
only
trained
woodsmen
could
read
the
tragedy
strange
how
i
cut
across
country
from
spruce
swamp
reflected
dale
circumstances
movements
usually
were
not
strange
to
him
his
methods
and
habits
were
seldom
changed
by
chance
the
matter
then
of
his
turning
off
a
course
out
of
his
way
for
no
apparent
reason
and
of
his
having
overheard
a
plot
singularly
involving
a
young
girl
was
indeed
an
adventure
to
provoke
thought
it
provoked
more
for
dale
grew
conscious
of
an
unfamiliar
smoldering
heat
along
his
veins
he
who
had
little
to
do
with
the
strife
of
men
and
nothing
to
do
with
anger
felt
his
blood
grow
hot
at
the
cowardly
trap
laid
for
an
innocent
girl
old
al
wo
listen
to
me
pondered
dale
an
even
if
he
did
he
would
believe
me
maybe
nobody
will
all
the
same
snake
anson
wo
get
that
with
these
last
words
dale
satisfied
himself
of
his
own
position
and
his
pondering
ceased
taking
his
rifle
he
descended
from
the
loft
and
peered
out
of
the
door
the
night
had
grown
darker
windier
cooler
broken
clouds
were
scudding
across
the
sky
only
a
few
stars
showed
fine
rain
was
blowing
from
the
northwest
and
the
forest
seemed
full
of
a
low
dull
roar
reckon
i
better
hang
up
here
he
said
and
turned
to
the
fire
the
coals
were
red
now
from
the
depths
of
his
he
procured
a
little
bag
of
salt
and
some
strips
of
dried
meat
these
strips
he
laid
for
a
moment
on
the
hot
embers
until
they
began
to
sizzle
and
curl
then
with
a
sharpened
stick
he
removed
them
and
ate
like
a
hungry
hunter
grateful
for
little
he
sat
on
a
block
of
wood
with
his
palms
spread
to
the
dying
warmth
of
the
fire
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
changing
glowing
golden
embers
outside
the
wind
continued
to
rise
and
the
moan
of
the
forest
increased
to
a
roar
dale
felt
the
comfortable
warmth
stealing
over
him
drowsily
lulling
and
he
heard
the
in
the
trees
now
like
a
waterfall
and
anon
like
a
retreating
army
and
again
low
and
sad
and
he
saw
pictures
in
the
glowing
embers
strange
as
dreams
presently
he
rose
and
climbing
to
the
loft
he
stretched
himself
out
and
soon
fell
asleep
when
the
gray
dawn
broke
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
village
of
pine
during
the
night
the
wind
had
shifted
and
the
rain
had
ceased
a
suspicion
of
frost
shone
on
the
grass
in
open
places
all
was
gray
the
parks
the
glades
and
deeper
darker
gray
marked
the
aisles
of
the
forest
shadows
lurked
under
the
trees
and
the
silence
seemed
consistent
with
spectral
forms
then
the
east
kindled
the
gray
lightened
the
dreaming
woodland
awoke
to
the
rays
of
a
bursting
red
sun
this
was
always
the
happiest
moment
of
dale
lonely
days
as
sunset
was
his
saddest
he
responded
and
there
was
something
in
his
blood
that
answered
the
whistle
of
a
stag
from
a
ridge
his
strides
were
long
noiseless
and
they
left
dark
trace
where
his
feet
brushed
the
grass
dale
pursued
a
zigzag
course
over
the
ridges
to
escape
the
hardest
climbing
but
the
senacas
those
parklike
meadows
so
named
by
mexican
were
as
round
and
level
as
if
they
had
been
made
by
man
in
beautiful
contrast
to
the
rough
and
rugged
ridges
both
open
senaca
and
dense
wooded
ridge
showed
to
his
quick
eye
an
abundance
of
game
the
cracking
of
twigs
and
disappearing
flash
of
gray
among
the
spruces
a
round
black
lumbering
object
a
twittering
in
the
brush
and
stealthy
steps
were
all
easy
signs
for
dale
to
read
once
as
he
noiselessly
emerged
into
a
little
glade
he
espied
a
red
fox
stalking
some
quarry
which
as
he
advanced
proved
to
be
a
flock
of
partridges
they
whirred
up
brushing
the
branches
and
the
fox
trotted
away
in
every
senaca
dale
encountered
wild
turkeys
feeding
on
the
seeds
of
the
high
grass
it
had
always
been
his
custom
on
his
visits
to
pine
to
kill
and
pack
fresh
meat
down
to
several
old
friends
who
were
glad
to
give
him
lodging
and
hurried
though
he
was
now
he
did
not
intend
to
make
an
exception
of
this
trip
at
length
he
got
down
into
the
pine
belt
where
the
great
gnarled
yellow
trees
soared
aloft
stately
and
aloof
from
one
another
and
the
ground
was
a
brown
odorous
springy
mat
of
level
as
a
floor
squirrels
watched
him
from
all
around
scurrying
away
at
his
near
approach
tiny
brown
squirrels
and
larger
ones
and
the
splendid
with
their
white
bushy
tails
and
plumed
ears
this
belt
of
pine
ended
abruptly
upon
wide
gray
rolling
open
land
almost
like
a
prairie
with
lifting
near
and
far
and
the
blaze
of
aspen
thickets
catching
the
morning
sun
here
dale
flushed
a
flock
of
wild
turkeys
upward
of
forty
in
number
and
their
subdued
color
of
gray
flecked
with
white
and
graceful
sleek
build
showed
them
to
be
hens
there
was
not
a
gobbler
in
the
flock
they
began
to
run
out
into
the
grass
until
only
their
heads
appeared
bobbing
along
and
finally
disappeared
dale
caught
a
glimpse
of
skulking
coyotes
that
evidently
had
been
stalking
the
turkeys
and
as
they
saw
him
and
darted
into
the
timber
he
took
a
quick
shot
at
the
hindmost
his
bullet
struck
low
as
he
had
meant
it
to
but
too
low
and
the
coyote
got
only
a
dusting
of
earth
and
thrown
up
into
his
face
this
frightened
him
so
that
he
leaped
aside
blindly
to
butt
into
a
tree
rolled
over
gained
his
feet
and
then
the
cover
of
the
forest
dale
was
amused
at
this
his
hand
was
against
all
the
predatory
beasts
of
the
forest
though
he
had
learned
that
lion
and
bear
and
wolf
and
fox
were
all
as
necessary
to
the
great
scheme
of
nature
as
were
the
gentle
beautiful
wild
creatures
upon
which
they
preyed
but
some
he
loved
better
than
others
and
so
he
deplored
the
inexplicable
cruelty
he
crossed
the
wide
grassy
plain
and
struck
another
gradual
descent
where
aspens
and
pines
crowded
a
shallow
ravine
and
warm
glades
bordered
along
a
sparkling
brook
here
he
heard
a
turkey
gobble
and
that
was
a
signal
for
him
to
change
his
course
and
make
a
crouching
silent
detour
around
a
clump
of
aspens
in
a
sunny
patch
of
grass
a
dozen
or
more
big
gobblers
stood
all
suspiciously
facing
in
his
direction
heads
erect
with
that
wild
aspect
peculiar
to
their
species
old
wild
turkey
gobblers
were
the
most
difficult
game
to
stalk
dale
shot
two
of
them
the
others
began
to
run
like
ostriches
thudding
over
the
ground
spreading
their
wings
and
with
that
running
start
launched
their
heavy
bodies
into
whirring
flight
they
flew
low
at
about
the
height
of
a
man
from
the
grass
and
vanished
in
the
woods
dale
threw
the
two
turkeys
over
his
shoulder
and
went
on
his
way
soon
he
came
to
a
break
in
the
forest
level
from
which
he
gazed
down
a
slope
of
pine
and
cedar
out
upon
the
bare
glistening
desert
stretching
away
endlessly
rolling
out
to
the
dim
dark
horizon
line
the
little
hamlet
of
pine
lay
on
the
last
level
of
sparsely
timbered
forest
a
road
running
parallel
with
a
stream
divided
the
cluster
of
log
cabins
from
which
columns
of
blue
smoke
drifted
lazily
aloft
fields
of
corn
and
fields
of
oats
yellow
in
the
sunlight
surrounded
the
village
and
green
pastures
dotted
with
horses
and
cattle
reached
away
to
the
denser
woodland
this
site
appeared
to
be
a
natural
clearing
for
there
was
no
evidence
of
cut
timber
the
scene
was
rather
too
wild
to
be
pastoral
but
it
was
serene
tranquil
giving
the
impression
of
a
remote
community
prosperous
and
happy
drifting
along
the
peaceful
tenor
of
sequestered
lives
dale
halted
before
a
neat
little
log
cabin
and
a
little
patch
of
garden
bordered
with
sunflowers
his
call
was
answered
by
an
old
woman
gray
and
bent
but
remarkably
spry
who
appeared
at
the
door
why

as

into
a
small
clean
kitchen
an
thet

ago
she
replied

her
gray
head

an

thus
while
preparing
a
meal
for
dale
the
old
woman
went
on
recounting
all
that
had
happened
in
the
little
village
since
his
last
visit
dale
enjoyed
her
gossip
and
quaint
philosophy
and
it
was
exceedingly
good
to
sit
at
her
table
in
his
opinion
nowhere
else
could
there
have
been
such
butter
and
cream
such
ham
and
eggs
besides

always
had
apple
pie

time

regrets
while
up
in
the
lonely
forest
how

presently
inquired

poorly

for
this
world

to

have

if

only

a
me

he
queried
half
amused
half
thoughtful
when
he
got
back
to
civilization
he
always
had
to
adjust
his
thoughts
to
the
ideas
of
people
why
i
declare
milt
you

so
in
the
woods

to

auntie
i

an
many
other
people
replied
cass
shaking
her
gray
head
doubtfully
you
never
swore
he
did
an
there
was
them
two
who
did
swear
they
seen
they
only
saw
a
cougar
an
they
were
so
scared
they
who
would
thet
big
beast
is
enough
to
scare
any
one
for
sakes
do
ever
fetch
him
down
here
again
i
never
forgit
the
time
you
did
all
the
folks
an
children
an
hosses
in
pine
broke
an
run
thet
yes
but
tom
was
to
blame
auntie
he
the
tamest
of
my
pets
did
he
try
to
put
his
head
on
your
lap
an
lick
your
hand
wal
milt
i
ai
gainsayin
your
cougar
pet
did
act
better
a
lot
of
people
i
know
fer
he
did
but
the
looks
of
him
an
what
been
said
was
enough
for
an
what
all
that
auntie
they
say
he
wild
when
out
of
your
sight
an
thet
he
trail
an
kill
anythin
you
put
him
i
trained
him
to
be
just
that
wal
leave
tom
to
home
up
in
the
woods
when
you
visit
dale
finished
his
hearty
meal
and
listened
awhile
longer
to
the
old
woman
talk
then
taking
his
rifle
and
the
other
turkey
he
bade
her
she
followed
him
out
now
milt
you
come
soon
again
wo
you
jest
to
see
niece
who
be
here
in
a
week
i
reckon
i
drop
in
some
day
auntie
have
you
seen
my
friends
the
mormon
boys
no
i
seen
them
an
do
want
to
she
retorted
milt
dale
if
any
one
ever
corrals
you
it
be
do
worry
auntie
i
like
those
boys
they
often
see
me
up
in
the
woods
an
ask
me
to
help
them
track
a
hoss
or
help
kill
some
fresh
they
workin
for
beasley
is
that
so
rejoined
dale
with
a
sudden
start
an
what
doin
beasley
is
gettin
so
rich
he
buildin
a
fence
an
did
have
enough
help
so
i
beasley
gettin
rich
repeated
dale
thoughtfully
more
sheep
horses
an
cattle
than
ever
i
reckon
why
milt
beasley
any
idea
what
he
owns
yes
the
biggest
man
in
these
parts
since
poor
old
al
took
to
failin
i
reckon
al
health
ai
none
improved
by
beasley
success
they
bad
some
bitter
quarrels
lately
so
i
hear
al
ai
what
he
dale
bade
again
to
his
old
friend
and
strode
away
thoughtful
and
serious
beasley
would
not
only
be
difficult
to
circumvent
but
he
would
be
dangerous
to
oppose
there
did
not
appear
much
doubt
of
his
driving
his
way
to
the
dominance
of
affairs
there
in
pine
dale
passing
down
the
road
began
to
meet
acquaintances
who
had
hearty
welcome
for
his
presence
and
interest
in
his
doings
so
that
his
pondering
was
interrupted
for
the
time
being
he
carried
the
turkey
to
another
old
friend
and
when
he
left
her
house
he
went
on
to
the
village
store
this
was
a
large
log
cabin
roughly
covered
with
clapboards
with
a
wide
plank
platform
in
front
and
a
in
the
road
several
horses
were
standing
there
and
a
group
of
lazy
loungers
i
be
doggoned
if
it
ai
milt
dale
exclaimed
one
howdy
milt
old
buckskin
right
down
glad
to
see
you
greeted
another
hello
dale
you
air
shore
good
for
sore
eyes
drawled
still
another
after
a
long
period
of
absence
dale
always
experienced
a
singular
warmth
of
feeling
when
he
met
these
acquaintances
it
faded
quickly
when
he
got
back
to
the
intimacy
of
his
woodland
and
that
was
because
the
people
of
pine
with
few
exceptions
though
they
liked
him
and
greatly
admired
his
outdoor
wisdom
regarded
him
as
a
sort
of
nonentity
because
he
loved
the
wild
and
preferred
it
to
village
and
range
life
they
had
classed
him
as
not
one
of
them
some
believed
him
lazy
others
believed
him
shiftless
others
thought
him
an
indian
in
mind
and
habits
and
there
were
many
who
called
him
then
there
was
another
side
to
their
regard
for
him
which
always
afforded
him
amusement
two
of
this
group
asked
him
to
bring
in
some
turkey
or
venison
another
wanted
to
hunt
with
him
lem
harden
came
out
of
the
store
and
appealed
to
dale
to
recover
his
stolen
horse
lem
brother
wanted
a
mare
tracked
and
brought
home
jesse
lyons
wanted
a
colt
broken
and
broken
with
patience
not
violence
as
was
the
method
of
the
boys
at
pine
so
one
and
all
they
besieged
dale
with
their
selfish
needs
all
unconscious
of
the
flattering
nature
of
these
overtures
and
on
the
moment
there
happened
by
two
women
whose
remarks
as
they
entered
the
store
bore
strong
testimony
to
dale
personality
if
there
ai
milt
dale
exclaimed
the
older
of
the
two
how
lucky
my
cow
sick
an
the
men
are
no
good
doctorin
i
jest
ask
milt
no
one
like
milt
responded
the
other
woman
heartily
good
day
there
you
milt
dale
called
the
first
speaker
when
you
git
away
from
these
lazy
men
come
dale
never
refused
a
service
and
that
was
why
his
infrequent
visits
to
pine
were
wont
to
be
prolonged
beyond
his
own
pleasure
presently
beasley
strode
down
the
street
and
when
about
to
enter
the
store
he
espied
dale
hullo
there
milt
he
called
cordially
as
he
came
forward
with
extended
hand
his
greeting
was
sincere
but
the
lightning
glance
he
shot
over
dale
was
not
born
of
his
pleasure
seen
in
daylight
beasley
was
a
big
bold
bluff
man
with
strong
dark
features
his
aggressive
presence
suggested
that
he
was
a
good
friend
and
a
bad
enemy
dale
shook
hands
with
him
how
are
you
beasley
ai
complainin
milt
though
i
got
more
work
than
i
can
rustle
reckon

would
take
a
job

replied
dale
thanks
all
the
what
goin
on
up
in
the
woods
plenty
of
turkey
an
deer
lots
of
bear
too
the
indians

the
south
side
early
this
fall
but
i
reckon
winter
will
come
late
an
be
good
an
where
you
headin
from
from
my
camp
replied
dale
rather
evasively
your
camp
nobody
ever
found
that
yet
declared
beasley
gruffly
it
up
there
said
dale
reckon
you
got
that
cougar
chained
in
your
cabin
door
queried
beasley
and
there
was
a
barely
distinguishable
shudder
of
his
muscular
frame
also
the
pupils
dilated
in
his
hard
brown
eyes
tom
ai
chained
an
i
have
no
cabin
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
big
brute
stays
in
your
camp
without
or
corralled
demanded
beasley
sure
he
beats
me
but
then
i
queer
on
cougars
have
had
many
a
cougar
trail
me
at
night
ai
sayin
i
was
scared
but
i
do
care
for
that
brand
of
varmint

to
stay
down
awhile
yes
i
hang
around

over
to
the
ranch
glad
to
see
you
any
time
some
old
pards
of
yours

workin
for
thanks
beasley
i
reckon
i
come
beasley
turned
away
and
took
a
step
and
then
as
if
with
an
he
wheeled
again
suppose
you
heard
about
old
al
auchincloss
bein
near
petered
out
queried
beasley
a
strong
ponderous
cast
of
thought
seemed
to
emanate
from
his
features
dale
divined
that
beasley
next
step
would
be
to
further
his
advancement
by
some
word
or
hint
widow
cass
was
tellin
me
all
the
news
too
bad
about
old
al
replied
dale
sure
is
he
done
for
an
i
sorry
though
al
never
been
square
beasley
interrupted
dale
quickly
you
ca
say
that
to
me
al
auchincloss
always
was
the
whitest
an
squarest
man
in
this
sheep
beasley
gave
dale
a
fleeting
dark
glance
dale
what
you
think
ai
goin
to
influence
feelin
on
this
range
returned
beasley
deliberately
you
live
in
the
woods
an
reckon
livin
in
the
woods
i
might
think
an
know
a
whole
lot
interposed
dale
just
as
deliberately
the
group
of
men
exchanged
surprised
glances
this
was
milt
dale
in
different
aspect
and
beasley
did
not
conceal
a
puzzled
surprise
about
what
now
he
asked
bluntly
why
about
what
goin
on
in
pine
replied
dale
some
of
the
men
laughed
shore
lots
goin
on
an
no
mistake
put
in
lem
harden
probably
the
keen
beasley
had
never
before
considered
milt
dale
as
a
responsible
person
certainly
never
one
in
any
way
to
cross
his
trail
but
on
the
instant
perhaps
some
instinct
was
born
or
he
divined
an
antagonism
in
dale
that
was
both
surprising
and
perplexing
dale
i
differences
with
al
auchincloss
have
had
them
for
years
said
beasley
much
of
what
he
owns
is
mine
an
it
goin
to
come
to
me
now
i
reckon
people
will
be
takin
sides
some
for
me
an
some
for
al
most
are
for
me
where
do
you
stand
al
auchincloss
never
had
no
use
for
you
an
besides
he
a
dyin
man
are
you
goin
on
his
side
yes
i
reckon
i
wal
i
glad
you
declared
yourself
rejoined
beasley
shortly
and
he
strode
away
with
the
ponderous
gait
of
a
man
who
would
brush
any
obstacle
from
his
path
milt
thet
bad
makin
beasley
sore
at
you
said
lem
harden
on
the
way
to
boss
this
he
sure
goin
to
step
into
al
boots
said
another
thet
was
white
of
milt
to
stick
up
fer
poor
old
al
declared
brother
dale
broke
away
from
them
and
wended
a
thoughtful
way
down
the
road
the
burden
of
what
he
knew
about
beasley
weighed
less
heavily
upon
him
and
the
course
he
had
decided
upon
appeared
wisest
he
needed
to
think
before
undertaking
to
call
upon
old
al
auchincloss
and
to
that
end
he
sought
an
hour
seclusion
under
the
pines
chapter
iii
in
the
afternoon
dale
having
accomplished
some
tasks
imposed
upon
him
by
his
old
friends
at
pine
directed
slow
steps
toward
the
auchincloss
ranch
the
flat
square
stone
and
log
cabin
of
unusually
large
size
stood
upon
a
little
hill
half
a
mile
out
of
the
village
a
home
as
well
as
a
fort
it
had
been
the
first
structure
erected
in
that
region
and
the
process
of
building
had
more
than
once
been
interrupted
by
indian
attacks
the
apaches
had
for
some
time
however
confined
their
fierce
raids
to
points
south
of
the
white
mountain
range
auchincloss
house
looked
down
upon
barns
and
sheds
and
corrals
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
and
hundreds
of
acres
of
soil
fields
of
oats
waved
gray
and
yellow
in
the
afternoon
sun
an
immense
green
pasture
was
divided
by
a
brook
and
here
were
droves
of
horses
and
out
on
the
rolling
bare
flats
were
straggling
herds
of
cattle
the
whole
ranch
showed
many
years
of
toil
and
the
perseverance
of
man
the
brook
irrigated
the
verdant
valley
between
the
ranch
and
the
village
water
for
the
house
however
came
down
from
the
high
wooded
slope
of
the
mountain
and
had
been
brought
there
by
a
simple
expedient
pine
logs
of
uniform
size
had
been
laid
end
to
end
with
a
deep
trough
cut
in
them
and
they
made
a
shining
line
down
the
slope
across
the
valley
and
up
the
little
hill
to
the
auchincloss
home
near
the
house
the
hollowed
halves
of
logs
had
been
bound
together
making
a
crude
pipe
water
ran
uphill
in
this
case
one
of
the
facts
that
made
the
ranch
famous
as
it
had
always
been
a
wonder
and
delight
to
the
small
boys
of
pine
the
two
good
women
who
managed
auchincloss
large
household
were
often
shocked
by
the
strange
things
that
floated
into
their
kitchen
with
the
stream
of
clear
cold
mountain
water
as
it
happened
this
day
dale
encountered
al
auchincloss
sitting
in
the
shade
of
a
porch
talking
to
some
of
his
and
stockmen
auchincloss
was
a
short
man
of
extremely
powerful
build
and
great
width
of
shoulder
he
had
no
gray
hairs
and
he
did
not
look
old
yet
there
was
in
his
face
a
certain
weariness
something
that
resembled
sloping
lines
of
distress
dim
and
pale
that
told
of
age
and
the
of
vitality
his
features
cast
in
large
mold
were
and
comely
and
he
had
frank
blue
eyes
somewhat
sad
yet
still
full
of
spirit
dale
had
no
idea
how
his
visit
would
be
taken
and
he
certainly
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
be
ordered
off
the
place
he
had
not
set
foot
there
for
years
therefore
it
was
with
surprise
that
he
saw
auchincloss
wave
away
the
herders
and
take
his
entrance
without
any
particular
expression
howdy
al
how
are
you
greeted
dale
easily
as
he
leaned
his
rifle
against
the
log
wall
auchincloss
did
not
rise
but
he
offered
his
hand
wal
milt
dale
i
reckon
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
seen
you
that
i
could
lay
you
flat
on
your
back
replied
the
rancher
his
tone
was
both
testy
and
full
of
pathos
i
take
it
you
mean
you
ai
very
well
replied
dale
i
sorry

thet

with
his
slow
smile
reckon
we
never
did
an
you
jest
come
over
to
pay
your
respects
to
me
eh

answered
dale
ponderingly
first
off
i
like
to
say
i
pay

always
claimed
my
tame
cougar
you
will
an
how
you
go
about
that
was
very
many
sheep

a
matter
of

so
many
al

them
sheep
humph

i
know

al
now
how

i

sheep

milt
dale
you

down
here
an
work
out
that
fifty
head
of
sheep
ejaculated
the
old
rancher
incredulously
wal
i
be
damned
he
sat
back
and
gazed
with
shrewd
eyes
at
dale
what
got
into
you
milt
hev
you
heard
about
my
niece
thet
comin
an
think
you
shine
up
to
her
yes
al
her
comin
has
a
good
deal
to
do
with
my
deal
replied
dale
soberly
but
i
never
thought
to
shine
up
to
her
as
you
haw
haw
you
just
like
all
the
other
colts
hereabouts
reckon
a
good
sign
too
it
take
a
woman
to
fetch
you
out
of
the
woods
but
boy
this
niece
of
mine
helen
rayner
will
stand
you
on
your
head
i
never
seen
her
they
say
she
jest
like
her
mother
an
nell
auchincloss
what
a
girl
she
was
dale
felt
his
face
grow
red
indeed
this
was
strange
conversation
for
him
honest
al
he
began
son
do
lie
to
an
old
lie
i
would
lie
to
any
one
al
it
only
men
who
live
in
towns
are
always
makin
deals
i
live
in
the
forest
where
there
nothin
to
make
me
wal
no
offense
meant
i
sure
responded
auchincloss
an
mebbe
there
somethin
in
what
you
say
we
was
talkin
about
them
sheep
your
big
cat
killed
wal
milt
i
ca
prove
it
that
sure
an
mebbe
you
think
me
doddery
when
i
tell
you
my
reason
it
was
what
them
greaser
herders
said
about
seein
a
cougar
in
the
what
was
it
then
queried
dale
much
interested
wal
thet
day
a
year
ago
i
seen
your
pet
he
was
lyin
in
front
of
the
store
an
you
was
inside
tradin
fer
supplies
i
reckon
it
was
like
meetin
an
enemy
face
to
face
because
damn
me
if
i
did
know
that
cougar
was
guilty
when
he
looked
in
my
eyes
there
the
old
rancher
expected
to
be
laughed
at
but
dale
was
grave
al
i
know
how
you
felt
he
replied
as
if
they
were
discussing
an
action
of
a
human
being
sure
i
hate
to
doubt
old
tom
but
he
a
cougar
an
the
ways
of
animals
are
strange
anyway
al
i
make
good
the
loss
of
your
no
you
wo
rejoined
auchincloss
quickly
we
call
it
off
takin
it
square
of
you
to
make
the
offer
thet
enough
so
forget
your
worry
about
work
if
you
had
there
somethin
else
al
i
wanted
to
say
began
dale
with
hesitation
an
it
about
auchincloss
started
violently
and
a
flame
of
red
shot
into
his
face
then
he
raised
a
big
hand
that
shook
dale
saw
in
a
flash
how
the
old
man
nerves
had
gone
do
mention
thet
thet
greaser
to
me
burst
out
the
rancher
it
makes
me
see
red
dale
i
ai
overlookin
that
you
spoke
up
fer
me
stood
fer
my
side
lem
harden
told
me
i
was
glad
an
why
i
forgot
our
old
quarrel
but
not
a
word
about

or
i
drive
you
off
the
place
but

be
reasonable
remonstrated
dale
it
necessary

of
of

ai
not
to
me
i
wo
reckon
you
have
to
al
returned
dale
beasley
after
your
property
he
made
a
deal
by
heaven
i
know
that
shouted
auchincloss
tottering
up
with
his
face
now
do
you
think
thet
new
to
me
shut
up
dale
i
ca
stand
but
al
there
worse
went
on
dale
hurriedly
worse
your
threatened
an
your
niece
helen
she
to
be
shut
up
an
clear
out
roared
auchincloss
waving
his
huge
fists
he
seemed
on
the
verge
of
a
collapse
as
shaking
all
over
he
backed
into
the
door
a
few
seconds
of
rage
had
transformed
him
into
a
pitiful
old
man
but
al
i
your
friend
began
dale
appealingly
friend
hey
returned
the
rancher
with
grim
bitter
passion
then
you
the
only
one
milt

i
rich
an

i
trust
nobody
but
you
wild

friend
prove
it
go
kill
thet
greaser

somethin
an
then
come
talk
to
me
with
that
he
lurched
half
falling
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
dale
stood
there
for
a
blank
moment
and
then
taking
up
his
rifle
he
strode
away
toward
sunset
dale
located
the
camp
of
his
four
mormon
friends
and
reached
it
in
time
for
supper
john
roy
joe
and
hal
beeman
were
sons
of
a
pioneer
mormon
who
had
settled
the
little
community
of
snowdrop
they
were
young
men
in
years
but
hard
labor
and
hard
life
in
the
open
had
made
them
look
matured
only
a
year
difference
in
age
stood
between
john
and
roy
and
between
roy
and
joe
and
likewise
joe
and
hal
when
it
came
to
appearance
they
were
difficult
to
distinguish
from
one
another
horsemen
hunters
they
all
possessed
long
wiry
powerful
frames
lean
bronzed
still
faces
and
the
quiet
keen
eyes
of
men
used
to
the
open
their
camp
was
situated
beside
a
spring
in
a
cove
surrounded
by
aspens
some
three
miles
from
pine
and
though
working
for
beasley
near
the
village
they
had
ridden
to
and
fro
from
camp
after
the
habit
of
seclusion
peculiar
to
their
kind
dale
and
the
brothers
had
much
in
common
and
a
warm
regard
had
sprang
up
but
their
exchange
of
confidences
had
wholly
concerned
things
pertaining
to
the
forest
dale
ate
supper
with
them
and
talked
as
usual
when
he
met
them
without
giving
any
hint
of
the
purpose
forming
in
his
mind
after
the
meal
he
helped
joe
round
up
the
horses
hobble
them
for
the
night
and
drive
them
into
a
grassy
glade
among
the
pines
later
when
the
shadows
stole
through
the
forest
on
the
cool
wind
and
the
glowed
comfortably
dale
broached
the
subject
that
possessed
him
an
so
you
working
for
beasley
he
queried
by
way
of
starting
conversation
we
was
drawled
john
but
bein
the
end
of
our
month
we
got
our
pay
an
quit
beasley
sure
was
why
you
knock
off
john
essayed
no
reply
and
his
brothers
all
had
that
quiet
suppressed
look
of
knowledge
under
restraint
listen
to
what
i
come
to
tell
you
then
you
talk
went
on
dale
and
hurriedly
he
told
of
beasley
plot
to
abduct
al
auchincloss
niece
and
claim
the
dying
man
property
when
dale
ended
rather
breathlessly
the
mormon
boys
sat
without
any
show
of
surprise
or
feeling
john
the
eldest
took
up
a
stick
and
slowly
poked
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
making
the
white
sparks
fly
now
milt
why
you
tell
us
thet
he
asked
guardedly
you
the
only
friends
i
got
replied
dale
it
did
seem
safe
for
me
to
talk
down
in
the
village
i
thought
of

ai

to
let

said
john
things

always
turn
out
as
they
look
but
no
matter
about
that
the
girl

is
what
riled
me
she
to
arrive

fellows

a
tight
pinch
with
a
bad
gang
will
you
stand
by
me
or
see
me
go
alone
then
john
beeman
silently
and
with
pale
face
gave
dale
hand
a
powerful
grip
and
one
by
one
the
other
brothers
rose
to
do
likewise
their
eyes
flashed
with
hard
glint
and
a
strange
bitterness
hovered
around
their
thin
lips
milt
mebbe
we
know
what
beasley
is
better
you
said
john
at
length
he
ruined
my
father
he
cheated

mormons

proved
to
ourselves
thet
he
gets
the
sheep
anson
gang
steals
drives
the
herds
to
phenix
our
people
wo
let
us
accuse
beasley
so
we
suffered
in
silence
my
father
always
said
let
some
one
else
say
the
first
word
against
beasley
an
you
come
to
us
roy
beeman
put
a
hand
on
dale
shoulder
he
perhaps
was
the
keenest
of
the
brothers
and
the
one
to
whom
adventure
and
peril
called
most
he
had
been
oftenest
with
dale
on
many
a
long
trail
and
he
was
the
hardest
rider
and
the
most
relentless
tracker
in
all
that
range
country
an
we
goin
with
you
he
said
in
a
strong
and
rolling
voice
they
resumed
their
seats
before
the
fire
john
threw
on
more
wood
and
with
a
crackling
and
sparkling
the
blaze
curled
up
fanned
by
the
wind
as
twilight
deepened
into
night
the
moan
in
the
pines
increased
to
a
roar
a
pack
of
coyotes
commenced
to
pierce
the
air
in
staccato
cries
the
five
young
men
conversed
long
and
earnestly
considering
planning
rejecting
ideas
advanced
by
each
dale
and
roy
beeman
suggested
most
of
what
became
acceptable
to
all
hunters
of
their
type
resembled
explorers
in
slow
and
deliberate
attention
to
details
what
they
had
to
deal
with
here
was
a
situation
of
unlimited
possibilities
the
horses
and
outfit
needed
a
long
detour
to
reach
magdalena
unobserved
the
rescue
of
a
strange
girl
who
would
no
doubt
be
and
determined
to
ride
on
the
stage
the
rescue
forcible
if
necessary
the
fight
and
the
inevitable
pursuit
the
flight
into
the
forest
and
the
safe
delivery
of
the
girl
to
auchincloss
then
milt
will
we
go
after
beasley
queried
roy
beeman
significantly
dale
was
silent
and
thoughtful
sufficient
unto
the
day
said
john
an
fellars
let
go
to
they
rolled
out
their
tarpaulins
dale
sharing
roy
blankets
and
soon
were
asleep
while
the
red
embers
slowly
faded
and
the
great
roar
of
wind
died
down
and
the
forest
stillness
set
in
chapter
iv
helen
rayner
had
been
on
the
westbound
overland
train
fully
hours
before
she
made
an
alarming
discovery
accompanied
by
her
sister
bo
a
precocious
girl
of
sixteen
helen
had
left
joseph
with
a
heart
saddened
by
farewells
to
loved
ones
at
home
yet
full
of
thrilling
and
vivid
anticipations
of
the
strange
life
in
the
far
west
all
her
people
had
the
pioneer
spirit
love
of
change
action
adventure
was
in
her
blood
then
duty
to
a
widowed
mother
with
a
large
and
growing
family
had
called
to
helen
to
accept
this
rich
uncle
offer
she
had
taught
school
and
also
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
she
had
helped
along
in
other
ways
and
now
though
the
tearing
up
of
the
roots
of
old
loved
ties
was
hard
this
opportunity
was
irresistible
in
its
call
the
prayer
of
her
dreams
had
been
answered
to
bring
good
fortune
to
her
family
to
take
care
of
this
beautiful
wild
little
sister
to
leave
the
yellow
sordid
humdrum
towns
for
the
great
rolling
boundless
open
to
live
on
a
wonderful
ranch
that
was
some
day
to
be
her
own
to
have
fulfilled
a
deep
instinctive
and
undeveloped
love
of
horses
cattle
sheep
of
desert
and
mountain
of
trees
and
brooks
and
wild
flowers
all
this
was
the
sum
of
her
most
passionate
longings
now
in
some
marvelous
fairylike
way
to
come
true
a
check
to
her
happy
anticipations
a
blank
sickening
dash
of
cold
water
upon
her
warm
and
intimate
dreams
had
been
the
discovery
that
harve
riggs
was
on
the
train
his
presence
could
mean
only
one
thing
that
he
had
followed
her
riggs
had
been
the
worst
of
many
sore
trials
back
there
in
joseph
he
had
possessed
some
claim
or
influence
upon
her
mother
who
favored
his
offer
of
marriage
to
helen
he
was
neither
attractive
nor
good
nor
industrious
nor
anything
that
interested
her
he
was
the
boastful
strutting
adventurer
not
genuinely
western
and
he
affected
long
hair
and
guns
and
notoriety
helen
had
suspected
the
veracity
of
the
many
fights
he
claimed
had
been
his
and
also
she
suspected
that
he
was
not
really
big
enough
to
be
bad
as
western
men
were
bad
but
on
the
train
in
the
station
at
la
junta
one
glimpse
of
him
manifestly
spying
upon
her
while
trying
to
keep
out
of
her
sight
warned
helen
that
she
now
might
have
a
problem
on
her
hands
the
recognition
sobered
her
all
was
not
to
be
a
road
of
roses
to
this
new
home
in
the
west
riggs
would
follow
her
if
he
could
not
accompany
her
and
to
gain
his
own
ends
he
would
stoop
to
anything
helen
felt
the
startling
realization
of
being
cast
upon
her
own
resources
and
then
a
numbing
discouragement
and
loneliness
and
helplessness
but
these
feelings
did
not
long
persist
in
the
quick
pride
and
flash
of
her
temper
opportunity
knocked
at
her
door
and
she
meant
to
be
at
home
to
it
she
would
not
have
been
al
auchincloss
niece
if
she
had
faltered
and
when
temper
was
succeeded
by
genuine
anger
she
could
have
laughed
to
scorn
this
harve
riggs
and
his
schemes
whatever
they
were
once
and
for
all
she
dismissed
fear
of
him
when
she
left
joseph
she
had
faced
the
west
with
a
beating
heart
and
a
high
resolve
to
be
worthy
of
that
west
homes
had
to
be
made
out
there
in
that
far
country
so
uncle
al
had
written
and
women
were
needed
to
make
homes
she
meant
to
be
one
of
these
women
and
to
make
of
her
sister
another
and
with
the
thought
that
she
would
know
definitely
what
to
say
to
riggs
when
he
approached
her
sooner
or
later
helen
dismissed
him
from
mind
while
the
train
was
in
motion
enabling
helen
to
watch
the
scenery
and
resting
her
from
the
strenuous
task
of
keeping
bo
well
in
hand
at
stations
she
lapsed
again
into
dreamy
gaze
at
the
pine
forests
and
the
red
rocky
gullies
and
the
dim
bold
mountains
she
saw
the
sun
set
over
distant
ranges
of
new
mexico
a
golden
blaze
of
glory
as
new
to
her
as
the
strange
fancies
born
in
her
thrilling
and
fleeting
by
bo
raptures
were
not
silent
and
the
instant
the
sun
sank
and
the
color
faded
she
just
as
rapturously
importuned
helen
to
get
out
the
huge
basket
of
food
they
had
brought
from
home
they
had
two
seats
facing
each
other
at
the
end
of
the
coach
and
piled
there
with
the
basket
on
top
was
luggage
that
constituted
all
the
girls
owned
in
the
world
indeed
it
was
very
much
more
than
they
had
ever
owned
before
because
their
mother
in
her
care
for
them
and
desire
to
have
them
look
well
in
the
eyes
of
this
rich
uncle
had
spent
money
and
pains
to
give
them
pretty
and
serviceable
clothes
the
girls
sat
together
with
the
heavy
basket
on
their
knees
and
ate
while
they
gazed
out
at
the
cool
dark
ridges
the
train
clattered
slowly
on
apparently
over
a
road
that
was
all
curves
and
it
was
for
everybody
in
that
crowded
coach
if
helen
had
not
been
so
absorbed
by
the
great
wild
she
would
have
had
more
interest
in
the
passengers
as
it
was
she
saw
them
and
was
amused
and
thoughtful
at
the
men
and
women
and
a
few
children
in
the
car
all
people
poor
and
hopeful
traveling
out
there
to
the
new
west
to
find
homes
it
was
splendid
and
beautiful
this
fact
yet
it
inspired
a
brief
and
inexplicable
sadness
from
the
train
window
that
world
of
forest
and
crag
with
its
long
bare
reaches
between
seemed
so
lonely
so
wild
so
unlivable
how
endless
the
distance
for
hours
and
miles
upon
miles
no
house
no
hut
no
indian
tepee
it
was
amazing
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
beautiful
land
and
helen
who
loved
brooks
and
running
streams
saw
no
water
at
all
then
darkness
settled
down
over
the
panorama
a
cool
night
wind
blew
in
at
the
window
white
stars
began
to
blink
out
of
the
blue
the
sisters
with
hands
clasped
and
heads
nestled
together
went
to
sleep
under
a
heavy
cloak
early
the
next
morning
while
the
girls
were
again
delving
into
their
apparently
bottomless
basket
the
train
stopped
at
las
vegas
look
look
cried
bo
in
thrilling
voice
cowboys
oh
nell
look
helen
laughing
looked
first
at
her
sister
and
thought
how
most
of
all
she
was
good
to
look
at
bo
was
little
instinct
with
pulsating
life
and
she
had
chestnut
hair
and
eyes
these
eyes
were
flashing
roguish
and
they
drew
like
magnets
outside
on
the
rude
station
platform
were
railroad
men
mexicans
and
a
group
of
lounging
cowboys
long
lean
fellows
they
were
with
young
frank
faces
and
intent
eyes
one
of
them
seemed
particularly
attractive
with
his
superb
build
his
face
and
scarf
his
swinging
gun
and
the
huge
long
curved
spurs
evidently
he
caught
bo
admiring
gaze
for
with
a
word
to
his
companions
he
sauntered
toward
the
window
where
the
girls
sat
his
gait
was
singular
almost
awkward
as
if
he
was
not
accustomed
to
walking
the
long
spurs
jingled
musically
he
removed
his
sombrero
and
stood
at
ease
frank
cool
smiling
helen
liked
him
on
sight
and
looking
to
see
what
effect
he
had
upon
bo
she
found
that
young
lady
staring
frightened
stiff
good
mawnin
drawled
the
cowboy
with
slow
smile
now
where
might
be
travelin
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
and
droll
geniality
seemed
new
and
delightful
to
helen
we
go
to
magdalena
then
take
stage
for
the
white
mountains
replied
helen
the
cowboy
still
intent
eyes
showed
surprise
apache
country
miss
he
said
i
reckon
i
sorry

shore
no
place

pawdin

now
wonderin
if
i
drift
down
there
an
ask
him
for
a
job
ridin
for
him
would
i
get
it
his
lazy
smile
was
infectious
and
his
meaning
was
as
clear
as
crystal
water
the
gaze
he
bent
upon
bo
somehow
pleased
helen
the
last
year
or
two
since
bo
had
grown
prettier
all
the
time
she
had
been
a
magnet
for
admiring
glances
this
one
of
the
cowboy
inspired
respect
and
liking
as
well
as
amusement
it
certainly
was
not
lost
upon
bo
my
uncle
once
said
in
a
letter
that
he
never
had
enough
men
to
run
his
ranch
replied
helen
smiling
shore
i
go
i
reckon
i
jest
naturally
drift
that
way
he
seemed
so
laconic
so
easy
so
nice
that
he
could
not
have
been
taken
seriously
yet
helen
quick
perceptions
registered
a
daring
a
something
that
was
both
sudden
and
inevitable
in
him
his
last
word
was
as
clear
as
the
soft
look
he
fixed
upon
bo
helen
had
a
mischievous
trait
which
subdue
it
as
she
would
occasionally
cropped
out
and
bo
who
once
in
her
wilful
life
had
been
rendered
speechless
offered
such
a
temptation
maybe
my
little
sister
will
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
to
uncle
al
said
helen
just
then
the
train
jerked
and
started
slowly
the
cowboy
took
two
long
strides
beside
the
car
his
heated
boyish
face
almost
on
a
level
with
the
window
his
eyes
now
shy
and
a
little
wistful
yet
bold
too
fixed
upon
bo
sweetheart
he
called
he
halted
was
lost
to
view
well
ejaculated
helen
contritely
half
sorry
half
amused
what
a
sudden
young
gentleman
bo
had
blushed
beautifully
nell
was
he
glorious
she
burst
out
with
eyes
shining
i
hardly
call
him
that
but
he
was
nice
replied
helen
much
relieved
that
bo
had
apparently
not
taken
offense
at
her
it
appeared
plain
that
bo
resisted
a
frantic
desire
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
to
wave
her
hand
but
she
only
peeped
out
manifestly
to
her
disappointment
do
you
think
he
he
come
to
uncle
al
asked
bo
child
he
was
only
in
nell
i
bet
you
he
comes
oh
it
be
great
i
going
to
love
cowboys
they
do
look
like
that
harve
riggs
who
ran
after
you
helen
sighed
partly
because
of
the
reminder
of
her
odious
suitor
and
partly
because
bo
future
already
called
mysteriously
to
the
child
helen
had
to
be
at
once
a
mother
and
a
protector
to
a
girl
of
intense
and
wilful
spirit
one
of
the
trainmen
directed
the
girls
attention
to
a
green
sloping
mountain
rising
to
a
bold
blunt
bluff
of
bare
rock
and
calling
it
starvation
peak
he
told
a
story
of
how
indians
had
once
driven
spaniards
up
there
and
starved
them
bo
was
intensely
interested
and
thereafter
she
watched
more
keenly
than
ever
and
always
had
a
question
for
a
passing
trainman
the
adobe
houses
of
the
mexicans
pleased
her
and
then
the
train
got
out
into
indian
country
where
pueblos
appeared
near
the
track
and
indians
with
their
bright
colors
and
shaggy
wild
mustangs
then
she
was
enraptured
but
these
indians
are
peaceful
she
exclaimed
once
regretfully
gracious
child
you
do
want
to
see
hostile
indians
do
you
queried
helen
i
do
you
bet
was
the
frank
rejoinder
well
i
bet
that
i
be
sorry
i
did
leave
you
with
nell
you
never
will
they
reached
albuquerque
about
noon
and
this
important
station
where
they
had
to
change
trains
had
been
the
first
dreaded
anticipation
of
the
journey
it
certainly
was
a
busy
place
full
of
jabbering
mexicans
stalking
cowboys
lolling
indians
in
the
confusion
helen
would
have
been
hard
put
to
it
to
preserve
calmness
with
bo
to
watch
and
all
that
baggage
to
carry
and
the
other
train
to
find
but
the
kindly
brakeman
who
had
been
attentive
to
them
now
helped
them
off
the
train
into
the
other
a
service
for
which
helen
was
very
grateful
albuquerque
a
hard
place
confided
the
trainman
better
stay
in
the
car
and
do
hang
out
the
windows
good
luck
to
you
only
a
few
passengers
were
in
the
car
and
they
were
mexicans
at
the
forward
end
this
branch
train
consisted
of
one
with
a
attached
to
a
string
of
helen
told
herself
somewhat
grimly
that
soon
she
would
know
surely
whether
or
not
her
suspicions
of
harve
riggs
had
warrant
if
he
was
going
on
to
magdalena
on
that
day
he
must
go
in
this
coach
presently
bo
who
was
not
obeying
admonitions
drew
her
head
out
of
the
window
her
eyes
were
wide
in
amaze
her
mouth
open
nell
i
saw
that
man
riggs
she
whispered
he
going
to
get
on
this
bo
i
saw
him
yesterday
replied
helen
soberly
he
followed
you
the
the
now
bo
do
get
excited
remonstrated
helen
we
left
home
now
we
got
to
take
things
as
they
come
never
mind
if
riggs
has
followed
me
i
settle
oh
then
you
wo
speak
have
anything
to
do
with
him
i
wo
if
i
can
help
other
passengers
boarded
the
train
dusty
uncouth
ragged
men
and
some
poorly
clad
women
marked
by
toil
and
several
more
mexicans
with
bustle
and
loud
talk
they
found
their
several
seats
then
helen
saw
harve
riggs
enter
burdened
with
much
luggage
he
was
a
man
of
about
medium
height
of
dark
flashy
appearance
cultivating
long
black
mustache
and
hair
his
apparel
was
striking
as
it
consisted
of
black
black
trousers
stuffed
in
high
boots
an
embroidered
vest
and
flowing
tie
and
a
black
sombrero
his
belt
and
gun
were
prominent
it
was
significant
that
he
excited
comment
among
the
other
passengers
when
he
had
deposited
his
pieces
of
baggage
he
seemed
to
square
himself
and
turning
abruptly
approached
the
seat
occupied
by
the
girls
when
he
reached
it
he
sat
down
upon
the
arm
of
the
one
opposite
took
off
his
sombrero
and
deliberately
looked
at
helen
his
eyes
were
light
glinting
with
hard
restless
quiver
and
his
mouth
was
coarse
and
arrogant
helen
had
never
seen
him
detached
from
her
home
surroundings
and
now
the
difference
struck
cold
upon
her
heart
hello
nell
he
said
surprised
to
see
me
no
she
replied
coldly
i
gamble
you
harve
riggs
i
told
you
the
day
before
i
left
home
that
nothing
you
could
do
or
say
mattered
to
reckon
that
ai
so
nell
any
woman
i
keep
track
of
has
reason
to
think
an
you
know
then
you
followed
me
out
here
demanded
helen
and
her
voice
despite
her
control
quivered
with
anger
i
sure
did
he
replied
and
there
was
as
much
thought
of
himself
in
the
act
as
there
was
of
her
why
why
it
useless
i
swore
i
have
you
or
nobody
else
would
he
replied
and
here
in
the
passion
of
his
voice
there
sounded
egotism
rather
than
hunger
for
a
woman
love
but
i
reckon
i
have
struck
west
anyhow
sooner
or
you
not
going
to
all
the
way
to
pine
faltered
helen
momentarily
weakening
nell
i
camp
on
your
trail
from
now
on
he
declared
then
bo
sat
with
pale
face
and
flashing
eyes
harve
riggs
you
leave
nell
alone
she
burst
out
in
ringing
brave
young
voice
i
tell
you
what
i
bet
if
you
follow
her
and
nag
her
any
more
my
uncle
al
or
some
cowboy
will
run
you
out
of
the
hello
pepper
replied
riggs
coolly
i
see
your
manners
improved
an
you
still
wild
about
people
do
have
good
manners
with
with
bo
hush
admonished
helen
it
was
difficult
to
reprove
bo
just
then
for
that
young
lady
had
not
the
slightest
fear
of
riggs
indeed
she
looked
as
if
she
could
slap
his
face
and
helen
realized
that
however
her
intelligence
had
grasped
the
possibilities
of
leaving
home
for
a
wild
country
and
whatever
her
determination
to
be
brave
the
actual
beginning
of
had
left
her
spirit
weak
she
would
rise
out
of
that
but
just
now
this
little
sister
seemed
a
protector
bo
would
readily
adapt
herself
to
the
west
helen
thought
because
she
was
so
young
primitive
elemental
whereupon
bo
turned
her
back
to
riggs
and
looked
out
of
the
window
the
man
laughed
then
he
stood
up
and
leaned
over
helen
nell
i
goin
wherever
you
go
he
said
steadily
you
can
take
that
friendly
or
not
just
as
it
pleases
you
but
if
you
got
any
sense
you
not
give
these
people
out
here
a
hunch
against
me
i
might
hurt
somebody
an
would
it
be
better
to
act
friends
for
i
goin
to
look
after
you
whether
you
like
it
or
helen
had
considered
this
man
an
annoyance
and
later
a
menace
and
now
she
must
declare
open
enmity
with
him
however
disgusting
the
idea
that
he
considered
himself
a
factor
in
her
new
life
it
was
the
truth
he
existed
he
had
control
over
his
movements
she
could
not
change
that
she
hated
the
need
of
thinking
so
much
about
him
and
suddenly
with
a
hot
bursting
anger
she
hated
the
man
you
not
look
after
me
i
take
care
of
myself
she
said
and
she
turned
her
back
upon
him
she
heard
him
mutter
under
his
breath
and
slowly
move
away
down
the
car
then
bo
slipped
a
hand
in
hers
never
mind
nell
she
whispered
you
know
what
old
sheriff
haines
said
about
harve
riggs
if
he
ever
strikes
a
real
western
town
he
get
run
out
of
it
i
just
wish
my
cowboy
had
got
on
this
train
helen
felt
a
rush
of
gladness
that
she
had
yielded
to
bo
wild
importunities
to
take
her
west
the
spirit
which
had
made
bo
incorrigible
at
home
probably
would
make
her
react
happily
to
life
out
in
this
free
country
yet
helen
with
all
her
warmth
and
gratefulness
had
to
laugh
at
her
sister
your
cowboy
why
bo
you
were
scared
stiff
and
now
you
claim
him
i
certainly
could
love
that
fellow
replied
bo
dreamily
child
you
been
saying
that
about
fellows
for
a
long
time
and
you
never
looked
twice
at
any
of
them
he
was
different
nell
i
bet
he
comes
to
i
hope
he
does
i
wish
he
was
on
this
train
i
liked
his
looks
well
nell
dear
he
looked
at
me
first
and
last
so
do
get
your
hopes
up
oh
the
train
starting
what
that
awful
name
nell
let
eat
dinner
i
then
helen
forgot
her
troubles
and
the
uncertain
future
and
what
with
listening
to
bo
chatter
and
partaking
again
of
the
endless
good
things
to
eat
in
the
huge
basket
and
watching
the
noble
mountains
she
drew
once
more
into
happy
mood
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
opened
to
view
wide
near
at
hand
in
a
great
gap
between
the
bare
black
mountains
narrow
in
the
distance
where
the
yellow
river
wound
away
glistening
under
a
hot
sun
bo
squealed
in
glee
at
sight
of
naked
little
mexican
children
that
darted
into
adobe
huts
as
the
train
clattered
by
and
she
exclaimed
her
pleasure
in
the
indians
and
the
mustangs
and
particularly
in
a
group
of
cowboys
riding
into
town
on
spirited
horses
helen
saw
all
bo
pointed
out
but
it
was
to
the
wonderful
rolling
valley
that
her
gaze
clung
longest
and
to
the
dim
purple
distance
that
seemed
to
hold
something
from
her
she
had
never
before
experienced
any
feeling
like
that
she
had
never
seen
a
tenth
so
far
and
the
sight
awoke
something
strange
in
her
the
sun
was
burning
hot
as
she
could
tell
when
she
put
a
hand
outside
the
window
and
a
strong
wind
blew
sheets
of
dry
dust
at
the
train
she
gathered
at
once
what
tremendous
factors
in
the
southwest
were
the
sun
and
the
dust
and
the
wind
and
her
realization
made
her
love
them
it
was
there
the
open
the
wild
the
beautiful
the
lonely
land
and
she
felt
the
poignant
call
of
blood
in
her
to
seek
to
strive
to
find
to
live
one
look
down
that
yellow
valley
endless
between
its
dark
iron
ramparts
had
given
her
understanding
of
her
uncle
she
must
be
like
him
in
spirit
as
it
was
claimed
she
resembled
him
otherwise
at
length
bo
grew
tired
of
watching
scenery
that
contained
no
life
and
with
her
bright
head
on
the
faded
cloak
she
went
to
sleep
but
helen
kept
steady
farseeing
gaze
out
upon
that
land
of
rock
and
plain
and
during
the
long
hours
as
she
watched
through
clouds
of
dust
and
veils
of
heat
some
strong
and
doubtful
and
restless
sentiment
seemed
to
change
and
then
to
fix
it
was
her
physical
acceptance
her
eyes
and
her
senses
taking
the
west
as
she
had
already
taken
it
in
spirit
a
woman
should
love
her
home
wherever
fate
placed
her
helen
believed
and
not
so
much
from
duty
as
from
delight
and
romance
and
living
how
could
life
ever
be
tedious
or
monotonous
out
here
in
this
tremendous
vastness
of
bare
earth
and
open
sky
where
the
need
to
achieve
made
thinking
and
pondering
superficial
it
was
with
regret
that
she
saw
the
last
of
the
valley
of
the
rio
grande
and
then
of
its
paralleled
mountain
ranges
but
the
miles
brought
compensation
in
other
valleys
other
bold
black
upheavals
of
rock
and
then
again
bare
boundless
yellow
plains
and
sparsely
cedared
ridges
and
white
dry
washes
ghastly
in
the
sunlight
and
dazzling
beds
of
alkali
and
then
a
desert
space
where
golden
and
blue
flowers
bloomed
she
noted
too
that
the
whites
and
yellows
of
earth
and
rock
had
begun
to
shade
to
red
and
this
she
knew
meant
an
approach
to
arizona
arizona
the
wild
the
lonely
the
red
desert
the
green
plateau
arizona
with
its
thundering
rivers
its
unknown
spaces
its
and
its
wild
horses
cowboys
outlaws
wolves
and
lions
and
savages
as
to
a
boy
that
name
stirred
and
thrilled
and
sang
to
her
of
nameless
sweet
intangible
things
mysterious
and
all
of
adventure
but
she
being
a
girl
of
twenty
who
had
accepted
responsibilities
must
conceal
the
depths
of
her
heart
and
that
which
her
mother
had
complained
was
her
misfortune
in
not
being
born
a
boy
time
passed
while
helen
watched
and
learned
and
dreamed
the
train
stopped
at
long
intervals
at
wayside
stations
where
there
seemed
nothing
but
adobe
sheds
and
lazy
mexicans
and
dust
and
heat
bo
awoke
and
began
to
chatter
and
to
dig
into
the
basket
she
learned
from
the
conductor
that
magdalena
was
only
two
stations
on
and
she
was
full
of
conjectures
as
to
who
would
meet
them
what
would
happen
so
helen
was
drawn
back
to
sober
realities
in
which
there
was
considerable
zest
assuredly
she
did
not
know
what
was
going
to
happen
twice
riggs
passed
up
and
down
the
aisle
his
dark
face
and
light
eyes
and
sardonic
smile
deliberately
forced
upon
her
sight
but
again
helen
fought
a
growing
dread
with
contemptuous
scorn
this
fellow
was
not
half
a
man
it
was
not
conceivable
what
he
could
do
except
annoy
her
until
she
arrived
at
pine
her
uncle
was
to
meet
her
or
send
for
her
at
snowdrop
which
place
helen
knew
was
distant
a
good
long
ride
by
stage
from
magdalena
this
was
the
climax
and
the
dread
of
all
the
long
journey
in
helen
considerations
oh
nell
cried
bo
with
delight
we
nearly
there
next
station
the
conductor
i
wonder
if
the
stage
travels
at
night
said
helen
thoughtfully
sure
it
does
replied
the
irrepressible
bo
the
train
though
it
clattered
along
as
usual
seemed
to
helen
to
fly
there
the
sun
was
setting
over
bleak
new
mexican
bluffs
magdalena
was
at
hand
and
night
and
adventure
helen
heart
beat
fast
she
watched
the
yellow
plains
where
the
cattle
grazed
their
presence
and
irrigation
ditches
and
told
her
that
the
railroad
part
of
the
journey
was
nearly
ended
then
at
bo
little
scream
she
looked
across
the
car
and
out
of
the
window
to
see
a
line
of
low
flat
houses
the
train
began
to
slow
down
helen
saw
children
run
white
children
and
mexican
together
then
more
houses
and
high
upon
a
hill
an
immense
adobe
church
crude
and
glaring
yet
somehow
beautiful
helen
told
bo
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
performing
a
like
office
for
herself
she
was
ashamed
of
the
trembling
of
her
fingers
there
were
bustle
and
talk
in
the
car
the
train
stopped
helen
peered
out
to
see
a
straggling
crowd
of
mexicans
and
indians
all
motionless
and
stolid
as
if
trains
or
nothing
else
mattered
next
helen
saw
a
white
man
and
that
was
a
relief
he
stood
out
in
front
of
the
others
tall
and
broad
somehow
striking
he
drew
a
second
glance
that
showed
him
to
be
a
hunter
clad
in
buckskin
and
carrying
a
rifle
chapter
v
here
there
was
no
kindly
brakeman
to
help
the
sisters
with
their
luggage
helen
bade
bo
take
her
share
thus
burdened
they
made
an
awkward
and
laborious
shift
to
get
off
the
train
upon
the
platform
of
the
car
a
strong
hand
seized
helen
heavy
bag
with
which
she
was
straining
and
a
loud
voice
called
out
girls
we
here
sure
out
in
the
wild
an
woolly
west
the
speaker
was
riggs
and
he
had
possessed
himself
of
part
of
her
baggage
with
action
and
speech
meant
more
to
impress
the
curious
crowd
than
to
be
really
kind
in
the
excitement
of
arriving
helen
had
forgotten
him
the
manner
of
sudden
reminder
the
insincerity
of
it
made
her
temper
flash
she
almost
fell
encumbered
as
she
was
in
her
hurry
to
descend
the
steps
she
saw
the
tall
hunter
in
gray
step
forward
close
to
her
as
she
reached
for
the
bag
riggs
held
mr
riggs
i
carry
my
bag
she
said
let
me
lug
this
you
help
bo
with
hers
he
replied
familiarly
but
i
want
it
she
rejoined
quietly
with
sharp
determination
no
little
force
was
needed
to
pull
the
bag
away
from
riggs
see
here
helen
you
ai
goin
any
farther
with
that
joke
are
you
he
queried
deprecatingly
and
he
still
spoke
quite
loud
it
no
joke
to
me
replied
helen
i
told
you
i
did
want
your
sure
but
that
was
temper
i
your
friend
from
your
home
town
an
i
ai
goin
to
let
a
quarrel
keep
me
from
lookin
after
you
till
safe
at
your
helen
turned
her
back
upon
him
the
tall
hunter
had
just
helped
bo
off
the
car
then
helen
looked
up
into
a
smooth
bronzed
face
and
piercing
gray
eyes
are
you
helen
rayner
he
asked
my
name
dale
i
come
to
meet
ah
my
uncle
sent
you
added
helen
in
quick
relief
no
i
ca
say
al
sent
me
began
the
man
but
i
reckon
he
was
interrupted
by
riggs
who
grasping
helen
by
the
arm
pulled
her
back
a
step
say
mister
did
auchincloss
send
you
to
meet
my
young
friends
here
he
demanded
arrogantly
dale
glance
turned
from
helen
to
riggs
she
could
not
read
this
quiet
gray
gaze
but
it
thrilled
her
no
i
come
on
my
own
hook
he
answered
you
understand
then
they
in
my
charge
added
riggs
this
time
the
steady
eyes
met
helen
and
if
there
was
not
a
smile
in
them
or
behind
them
she
was
still
further
baffled
helen
i
reckon
you
said
you
did
want
this
fellow
i
certainly
said
that
replied
helen
quickly
just
then
bo
slipped
close
to
her
and
gave
her
arm
a
little
squeeze
probably
bo
thought
was
like
hers
here
was
a
real
western
man
that
was
her
first
impression
and
following
swiftly
upon
it
was
a
sensation
of
eased
nerves
riggs
swaggered
closer
to
dale
say
buckskin
i
hail
from
texas
you
wastin
our
time
an
we
need
to
hurry
interrupted
dale
his
tone
seemed
friendly
an
if
you
ever
lived
long
in
texas
you
pester
a
lady
an
you
sure
would
talk
like
you
what
shouted
riggs
hotly
he
dropped
his
right
hand
significantly
to
his
hip
do
throw
your
gun
it
might
go
off
said
dale
whatever
riggs
intention
had
been
and
it
was
probably
just
what
dale
evidently
had
read
it
he
now
flushed
an
angry
red
and
jerked
at
his
gun
dale
hand
flashed
too
swiftly
for
helen
eye
to
follow
it
but
she
heard
the
thud
as
it
struck
the
gun
went
flying
to
the
platform
and
scattered
a
group
of
indians
and
mexicans
you
hurt
yourself
some
day
said
dale
helen
had
never
heard
a
slow
cool
voice
like
this
hunter
without
excitement
or
emotion
or
hurry
it
yet
seemed
full
and
significant
of
things
the
words
did
not
mean
bo
uttered
a
strange
little
exultant
cry
riggs
arm
had
dropped
limp
no
doubt
it
was
numb
he
stared
and
his
predominating
expression
was
surprise
as
the
shuffling
crowd
began
to
snicker
and
whisper
riggs
gave
dale
a
malignant
glance
shifted
it
to
helen
and
then
lurched
away
in
the
direction
of
his
gun
dale
did
not
pay
any
more
attention
to
him
gathering
up
baggage
he
said
come
on
and
shouldered
a
lane
through
the
gaping
crowd
the
girls
followed
close
at
his
heels
nell
what
i
tell
you
whispered
bo
oh
you
all
atremble
helen
was
aware
of
her
unsteadiness
anger
and
fear
and
relief
in
quick
succession
had
left
her
rather
weak
once
through
the
motley
crowd
of
loungers
she
saw
an
old
gray
and
four
lean
horses
a
grizzled
sunburned
man
sat
on
the
driver
seat
whip
and
reins
in
hand
beside
him
was
a
younger
man
with
rifle
across
his
knees
another
man
young
tall
lean
dark
stood
holding
the
coach
door
open
he
touched
his
sombrero
to
the
girls
his
eyes
were
sharp
as
he
addressed
dale
milt
was
you
held
up
no
but
some
galoot
was
tryin
to
hold
up
the
girls
wanted
to
throw
his
gun
on
me
i
was
sure
scared
replied
dale
as
he
deposited
the
luggage
bo
laughed
her
eyes
resting
upon
dale
were
warm
and
bright
the
young
man
at
the
coach
door
took
a
second
look
at
her
and
then
a
smile
changed
the
dark
hardness
of
his
face
dale
helped
the
girls
up
the
high
step
into
the
stage
and
then
placing
the
lighter
luggage
in
with
them
he
threw
the
heavier
pieces
on
top
joe
climb
up
he
said
wal
milt
drawled
the
driver
let
ooze
dale
hesitated
with
his
hand
on
the
door
he
glanced
at
the
crowd
now
edging
close
again
and
then
at
helen
i
reckon
i
ought
to
tell
you
he
said
and
indecision
appeared
to
concern
him
what
exclaimed
helen
bad
news
but
talkin
takes
time
an
we
must
lose
there
need
of
hurry
queried
helen
sitting
up
sharply
i
is
this
the
stage
to
snowdrop
no
that
leaves
in
the
mornin
we
rustled
this
old
trap
to
get
a
start
the
sooner
the
better
but
i
i
do
understand
said
helen
bewildered
it
not
be
safe
for
you
to
ride
on
the
mornin
stage
returned
dale
safe
oh
what
do
you
mean
exclaimed
helen
apprehensively
she
gazed
at
him
and
then
back
at
bo
explainin
will
take
time
an
facts
may
change
your
mind
but
if
you
ca
trust
me
trust
you
interposed
helen
blankly
you
mean
to
take
us
to
snowdrop
i
reckon
we
better
go
roundabout
an
not
hit
snowdrop
he
replied
shortly
then
to
pine
to
my
uncle
al
auchincloss
yes
i
goin
to
try
helen
caught
her
breath
she
divined
that
some
peril
menaced
her
she
looked
steadily
with
all
a
woman
keenness
into
this
man
face
the
moment
was
one
of
the
fateful
decisions
she
knew
the
west
had
in
store
for
her
her
future
and
that
of
bo
were
now
to
be
dependent
upon
her
judgments
it
was
a
hard
moment
and
though
she
shivered
inwardly
she
welcomed
the
initial
and
inevitable
step
this
man
dale
by
his
dress
of
buckskin
must
be
either
scout
or
hunter
his
size
his
action
the
tone
of
his
voice
had
been
reassuring
but
helen
must
decide
from
what
she
saw
in
his
face
whether
or
not
to
trust
him
and
that
face
was
clear
bronze
unlined
unshadowed
like
a
tranquil
mask
with
eyes
of
wonderful
transparent
gray
yes
i
trust
you
she
said
get
in
and
let
us
hurry
then
you
can
all
ready
bill
send
along
called
dale
he
had
to
stoop
to
enter
the
stage
and
once
in
he
appeared
to
fill
that
side
upon
which
he
sat
then
the
driver
cracked
his
whip
the
stage
lurched
and
began
to
roll
the
motley
crowd
was
left
behind
helen
awakened
to
the
reality
as
she
saw
bo
staring
with
big
eyes
at
the
hunter
that
a
stranger
adventure
than
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
had
began
with
the
rattling
roll
of
that
old
dale
laid
off
his
sombrero
and
leaned
forward
holding
his
rifle
between
his
knees
the
light
shone
better
upon
his
features
now
that
he
was
bareheaded
helen
had
never
seen
a
face
like
that
which
at
first
glance
appeared
darkly
bronzed
and
hard
and
then
became
clear
cold
aloof
still
intense
she
wished
she
might
see
a
smile
upon
it
and
now
that
the
die
was
cast
she
could
not
tell
why
she
had
trusted
it
there
was
singular
force
in
it
but
she
did
not
recognize
what
kind
of
force
one
instant
she
thought
it
was
stern
and
the
next
that
it
was
sweet
and
again
that
it
was
neither
i
glad
you
got
your
sister
he
said
presently
how
did
you
know
she
my
sister
i
reckon
she
looks
like
no
one
else
ever
thought
so
replied
helen
trying
to
smile
bo
had
no
difficulty
in
smiling
as
she
said
wish
i
was
half
as
pretty
as
nell
is
your
name
helen
queried
dale
yes
but
my
some
few
call
me
i
like
nell
better
than
helen
an
what
yours
went
on
dale
looking
at
bo
mine
bo
just
plain
is
it
silly
but
i
was
asked
when
they
gave
it
to
me
she
replied
bo
it
nice
an
short
never
heard
it
before
but
i
have
met
many
people
for
oh
we
left
the
town
cried
bo
look
nell
how
bare
it
just
like
it
is
desert
we
forty
miles
of
that
before
we
come
to
a
hill
or
a
helen
glanced
out
a
flat
expanse
waved
away
from
the
road
on
and
on
to
a
bright
dark
where
the
sun
was
setting
rayless
in
a
clear
sky
open
desolate
and
lonely
the
scene
gave
her
a
cold
thrill
did
your
uncle
al
ever
write
anythin
about
a
man
named
beasley
asked
dale
indeed
he
did
replied
helen
with
a
start
of
surprise
beasley
that
name
is
familiar
to
us
and
detestable
my
uncle
complained
of
this
man
for
years
then
he
grew
bitter
accused
beasley
but
the
last
year
or
so
not
a
word
well
now
began
the
hunter
earnestly
let
get
the
bad
news
over
i
sorry
you
must
be
worried
but
you
must
learn
to
take
the
west
as
it
is
there
good
an
bad
maybe
more
bad
that
because
the
young
so
to
come
right
out
with
it
this
beasley
hired
a
gang
of
outlaws
to
meet
the
stage
you
was
goin
in
to
snowdrop
to
make
off
with
make
off
with
me
ejaculated
helen
bewildered
kidnap
you
which
in
that
gang
would
be
worse
than
killing
you
declared
dale
grimly
and
he
closed
a
huge
fist
on
his
knee
helen
was
utterly
astounded
how
she
gasped
out
make
off
with
me
what
in
name
for
bo
gave
vent
to
a
fierce
little
utterance
for
reasons
you
ought
to
guess
replied
dale
and
he
leaned
forward
again
neither
his
voice
nor
face
changed
in
the
least
but
yet
there
was
a
something
about
him
that
fascinated
helen
i
a
hunter
i
live
in
the
woods
a
few
nights
ago
i
happened
to
be
caught
out
in
a
storm
an
i
took
to
an
old
log
cabin
soon
as
i
got
there
i
heard
horses
i
hid
up
in
the
loft
some
men
rode
up
an
come
in
it
was
dark
they
could
see
me
an
they
talked
it
turned
out
they
were
snake
anson
an
his
gang
of
they
expected
to
meet
beasley
there
pretty
soon
he
came
he
told
anson
how
old
al
your
uncle
was
on
his
last
legs
how
he
had
sent
for
you
to
have
his
property
when
he
died
beasley
swore
he
had
claims
on
al
an
he
made
a
deal
with
anson
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
he
named
the
day
you
were
to
reach
magdalena
with
al
dead
an
you
not
there
beasley
could
get
the
property
an
then
he
would
care
if
you
did
come
to
claim
it
it
be
too
late
well
they
rode
away
that
night
an
next
day
i
rustled
down
to
pine
all
my
friends
at
pine
except
old
al
but
they
think
i
queer
i
did
want
to
confide
in
many
people
beasley
is
strong
in
pine
for
that
matter
i
suspect
snake
anson
has
other
friends
there
besides
beasley
so
i
went
to
see
your
uncle
he
never
had
any
use
for
me
because
he
thought
i
was
lazy
like
an
indian
old
al
hates
lazy
men
then
we
fell
out
or
he
fell
out
because
he
believed
a
tame
lion
of
mine
had
killed
some
of
his
sheep
an
now
i
reckon
that
tom
might
have
done
it
i
tried
to
lead
up
to
this
deal
of
beasley
about
you
but
old
al
would
listen
he
cross
very
cross
an
when
i
tried
to
tell
him
why
he
went
right
out
of
his
head
sent
me
off
the
ranch
now
i
reckon
you
begin
to
see
what
a
pickle
i
was
in
finally
i
went
to
four
friends
i
could
trust
they
mormon
boys
brothers
that
joe
out
on
top
with
the
driver
i
told
them
all
about
beasley
deal
an
asked
them
to
help
me
so
we
planned
to
beat
anson
an
his
gang
to
magdalena
it
happens
that
beasley
is
as
strong
in
magdalena
as
he
is
in
pine
an
we
had
to
go
careful
but
the
boys
had
a
couple
of
friends
here
mormons
too
who
agreed
to
help
us
they
had
this
old
stage
an
here
you
dale
spread
out
his
big
hands
and
looked
gravely
at
helen
and
then
at
bo
you
perfectly
splendid
cried
bo
ringingly
she
was
white
her
fingers
were
clenched
her
eyes
blazed
dale
appeared
startled
out
of
his
gravity
and
surprised
then
pleased
a
smile
made
his
face
like
a
boy
helen
felt
her
body
all
rigid
yet
slightly
trembling
her
hands
were
cold
the
horror
of
this
revelation
held
her
speechless
but
in
her
heart
she
echoed
bo
exclamation
of
admiration
and
gratitude
so
far
then
resumed
dale
with
a
heavy
breath
of
relief
no
wonder
you
upset
i
a
blunt
way
of
talkin
now
we
thirty
miles
to
ride
on
this
snowdrop
road
before
we
can
turn
off
sometime
the
rest
of
the
boys
roy
john
an
hal
were
to
leave
show
down
a
town
farther
on
from
snowdrop
they
have
my
horses
an
packs
besides
their
own
somewhere
on
the
road
we
meet
them
maybe

because
that
mean
anson
gang
was
ridin
in
to
helen
wrung
her
hands
helplessly
oh
have
i
no
courage
she
whispered
nell
i
as
scared
as
you
are
said
bo
consolingly
embracing
her
sister
i
reckon
that
natural
said
dale
as
if
excusing
them
but
scared

a
bad
job
but
i
done
my
best

an
the
beeman
boys

magdalena
or
anywhere

except
your
mr
dale
faltered
helen
with
her
tears
falling
do
think
me
a
coward
or
or
ungrateful
i
neither
it
only
i
so
so
shocked
after
all
we
hoped
and
expected
this
this
is
such
a
a
terrible
never
mind
nell
dear
let
take
what
comes
murmured
bo
that
the
talk
said
dale
you
see
i
come
right
out
with
the
worst
maybe
we
get
through
easy
when
we
meet
the
boys
we
take
to
the
horses
an
the
trails
can
you
ride
bo
has
been
used
to
horses
all
her
life
and
i
ride
fairly
well
responded
helen
the
idea
of
riding
quickened
her
spirit
good
we
may
have
some
hard
ridin
before
i
get
you
up
to
pine
hello
what
that
above
the
creaking
rattling
rolling
roar
of
the
stage
helen
heard
a
rapid
beat
of
hoofs
a
horse
flashed
by
galloping
hard
dale
opened
the
door
and
peered
out
the
stage
rolled
to
a
halt
he
stepped
down
and
gazed
ahead
joe
who
was
that
he
queried
nary
me
an
bill
did
know
him
either
replied
joe
i
seen
him
back
he
was
ridin
some
an
he
slowed
up
goin
past
us
now
runnin
dale
shook
his
head
as
if
he
did
not
like
the
circumstances
milt
he
never
get
by
roy
on
this
road
said
joe
maybe
he
get
by
before
roy
strikes
in
on
the
it
ai
helen
could
not
restrain
her
fears
mr
dale
you
think
he
was
a
messenger
going
ahead
to
post
that
that
anson
gang
he
might
be
replied
dale
simply
then
the
young
man
called
joe
leaned
out
from
the
seat
above
and
called
miss
helen
do
you
worry
thet
fellar
is
more
liable
to
stop
lead
than
anythin
his
words
meant
to
be
kind
and
reassuring
were
almost
as
sinister
to
helen
as
the
menace
to
her
own
life
long
had
she
known
how
cheap
life
was
held
in
the
west
but
she
had
only
known
it
abstractly
and
she
had
never
let
the
fact
remain
before
her
consciousness
this
cheerful
young
man
spoke
calmly
of
spilling
blood
in
her
behalf
the
thought
it
roused
was
tragic
for
bloodshed
was
insupportable
to
her
and
then
the
thrills
which
followed
were
so
new
strange
bold
and
tingling
that
they
were
revolting
helen
grew
conscious
of
unplumbed
depths
of
instincts
at
which
she
was
amazed
and
ashamed
joe
hand
down
that
basket
of
grub
the
small
one
with
the
canteen
said
dale
reaching
out
a
long
arm
presently
he
placed
a
basket
inside
the
stage
girls
eat
all
you
want
an
then
we
have
a
basket
half
full
yet
replied
helen
you
need
it
all
before
we
get
to
pine
now
i
ride
up
on
top
with
the
boys
an
eat
my
supper
it
be
dark
presently
an
stop
often
to
listen
but
do
be
with
that
he
took
his
rifle
and
closing
the
door
clambered
up
to
the
driver
seat
then
the
stage
lurched
again
and
began
to
roll
along
not
the
least
thing
to
wonder
at
of
this
eventful
evening
was
the
way
bo
reached
for
the
basket
of
food
helen
simply
stared
at
her
bo
you
ca
eat
she
exclaimed
i
should
smile
i
can
replied
that
practical
young
lady
and
going
to
if
i
have
to
stuff
things
in
your
mouth
where
your
wits
nell
he
said
we
must
eat
that
means
our
strength
is
going
to
have
some
pretty
severe
trials
gee
it
all
great
just
like
a
story
the
unexpected
why
he
looks
like
a
prince
turned
hunter
long
dark
stage
journey
held
up
fight
escape
wild
ride
on
horses
woods
and
camps
and
wild
places
pursued
hidden
in
the
forest
more
hard
rides
then
safe
at
the
ranch
and
of
course
he
falls
madly
in
love
with
me
no
you
for
i
be
true
to
my
las
vegas
lover
hush
silly
bo
tell
me
are
you
scared
scared
i
scared
stiff
but
if
western
girls
stand
such
things
we
can
no
western
girl
is
going
to
beat
me
that
brought
helen
to
a
realization
of
the
brave
place
she
had
given
herself
in
dreams
and
she
was
at
once
ashamed
of
herself
and
wildly
proud
of
this
little
sister
bo
thank
heaven
i
brought
you
with
me
exclaimed
helen
fervently
i
eat
if
it
chokes
whereupon
she
found
herself
actually
hungry
and
while
she
ate
she
glanced
out
of
the
stage
first
from
one
side
and
then
from
the
other
these
windows
had
no
glass
and
they
let
the
cool
night
air
blow
in
the
sun
had
long
since
sunk
out
to
the
west
where
a
bold
black
swept
away
endlessly
the
sky
was
clear
gold
shading
to
yellow
and
blue
above
stars
were
out
pale
and
wan
but
growing
brighter
the
earth
appeared
bare
and
heaving
like
a
calm
sea
the
wind
bore
a
fragrance
new
to
helen
acridly
sweet
and
clean
and
it
was
so
cold
it
made
her
fingers
numb
i
heard
some
animal
yelp
said
bo
suddenly
and
she
listened
with
head
poised
but
helen
heard
nothing
save
the
steady
of
hoofs
the
clink
of
chains
the
creak
and
rattle
of
the
old
stage
and
occasionally
the
low
voices
of
the
men
above
when
the
girls
had
satisfied
hunger
and
thirst
night
had
settled
down
black
they
pulled
the
cloaks
up
over
them
and
close
together
leaned
back
in
a
corner
of
the
seat
and
talked
in
whispers
helen
did
not
have
much
to
say
but
bo
was
talkative
this
beats
me
she
said
once
after
an
interval
where
are
we
nell
those
men
up
there
are
mormons
maybe
they
are
abducting
us
mr
dale
is
a
mormon
replied
helen
how
do
you
know
i
could
tell
by
the
way
he
spoke
of
his
well
i
wish
it
was
so
dark
i
not
afraid
of
men
in
daylight
nell
did
you
ever
see
such
a
wonderful
looking
fellow
what
they
call
him
milt
milt
dale
he
said
he
lived
in
the
woods
if
i
had
fallen
in
love
with
that
cowboy
who
called
me
well
i
be
a
goner
after
an
interval
of
silence
bo
whispered
startlingly
wonder
if
harve
riggs
is
following
us
now
of
course
he
is
replied
helen
hopelessly
he
better
look
out
why
nell
he
never
saw
he
never
what
did
uncle
al
used
to
call
it
sav
savvied
that
it
riggs
never
savvied
that
hunter
but
i
did
you
savvied
what
do
you
mean
bo
i
mean
that
galoot
never
saw
his
real
danger
but
i
felt
it
something
went
light
inside
me
dale
never
took
him
seriously
at
riggs
will
turn
up
at
uncle
al
sure
as
i
born
said
helen
let
him
turn
replied
bo
contemptuously
nell
do
you
ever
bother
your
head
again
about
him
i
bet
they
all
men
out
here
and
i
would
be
in
harve
riggs
boots
for
a
after
that
bo
talked
of
her
uncle
and
his
fatal
illness
and
from
that
she
drifted
back
to
the
loved
ones
at
home
now
seemingly
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
then
she
broke
down
and
cried
after
which
she
fell
asleep
on
helen
shoulder
but
helen
could
not
have
fallen
asleep
if
she
had
wanted
to
she
had
always
since
she
could
remember
longed
for
a
moving
active
life
and
for
want
of
a
better
idea
she
had
chosen
to
dream
of
gipsies
and
now
it
struck
her
grimly
that
if
these
first
few
hours
of
her
advent
in
the
west
were
forecasts
of
the
future
she
was
destined
to
have
her
longings
more
than
fulfilled
presently
the
stage
rolled
slower
and
slower
until
it
came
to
a
halt
then
the
horses
heaved
the
harnesses
clinked
the
men
whispered
otherwise
there
was
an
intense
quiet
she
looked
out
expecting
to
find
it
it
was
black
yet
a
transparent
blackness
to
her
surprise
she
could
see
a
long
way
a
electrified
her
the
men
were
listening
she
listened
too
but
beyond
the
slight
sounds
about
the
stage
she
heard
nothing
presently
the
driver
clucked
to
his
horses
and
travel
was
resumed
for
a
while
the
stage
rolled
on
rapidly
evidently
downhill
swaying
from
side
to
side
and
rattling
as
if
about
to
fall
to
pieces
then
it
slowed
on
a
level
and
again
it
halted
for
a
few
moments
and
once
more
in
motion
it
began
a
laborsome
climb
helen
imagined
miles
had
been
covered
the
desert
appeared
to
heave
into
billows
growing
rougher
and
dark
round
bushes
dimly
stood
out
the
road
grew
uneven
and
rocky
and
when
the
stage
began
another
descent
its
violent
rocking
jolted
bo
out
of
her
sleep
and
in
fact
almost
out
of
helen
arms
where
am
i
asked
bo
dazedly
bo
you
having
your
heart
desire
but
i
ca
tell
you
where
you
are
replied
helen
bo
awakened
thoroughly
which
fact
was
now
no
wonder
considering
the
jostling
of
the
old
stage
hold
on
to
me
nell
is
it
a
runaway
we
come
about
a
thousand
miles
like
this
i
think
replied
helen
i
not
a
whole
bone
in
my
bo
peered
out
of
the
window
oh
how
dark
and
lonesome
but
it
be
nice
if
it
was
so
cold
i
thought
you
loved
cold
air
taunted
helen
say
nell
you
begin
to
talk
like
yourself
responded
bo
it
was
difficult
to
hold
on
to
the
stage
and
each
other
and
the
cloak
all
at
once
but
they
succeeded
except
in
the
roughest
places
when
from
time
to
time
they
were
bounced
around
bo
sustained
a
sharp
rap
on
the
head
oooooo
she
moaned
nell
rayner
i
never
forgive
you
for
fetching
me
on
this
awful
just
think
of
your
handsome
las
vegas
cowboy
replied
helen
either
this
remark
subdued
bo
or
the
suggestion
sufficed
to
reconcile
her
to
the
hardships
of
the
ride
meanwhile
as
they
talked
and
maintained
silence
and
tried
to
sleep
the
driver
of
the
stage
kept
at
his
task
after
the
manner
of
western
men
who
knew
how
to
get
the
best
out
of
horses
and
bad
roads
and
distance
by
and
by
the
stage
halted
again
and
remained
at
a
standstill
for
so
long
with
the
men
whispering
on
top
that
helen
and
bo
were
roused
to
apprehension
suddenly
a
sharp
whistle
came
from
the
darkness
ahead
thet
roy
said
joe
beeman
in
a
low
voice

reckon

meetin

the

but
if

come
thirty
mile
an
if
thet
ridge
thar
hai
your
place
why
i
do
know
the
stage
rolled
on
a
little
farther
while
helen
and
bo
sat
clasping
each
other
tight
wondering
with
bated
breath
what
was
to
be
the
next
thing
to
happen
then
once
more
they
were
at
a
standstill
helen
heard
the
thud
of
boots
striking
the
ground
and
the
snorts
of
horses
nell
i
see
horses
whispered
bo
excitedly
there
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
here
comes
a
man
oh
if
he
should
be
the
one
they
expecting
helen
peered
out
to
see
a
tall
dark
form
moving
silently
and
beyond
it
a
vague
outline
of
horses
and
then
pale
gleams
of
what
must
have
been
dale
loomed
up
and
met
the
stranger
in
the
road
howdy
milt

said
a
low
voice

dale
the
man

whistled
softly
under
his
breath
then
another
lean
rangy
form

out
of
the
darkness
and
was
met
by
dale

throb
of
her
heart

the
panting
little
breaths
of
her
sister
they
both
peered
out
hands
clenched
together
watching
and
listening

strained
attention

encountered

eyes
upon

face
he
seemed
both
gentle
and
respectful
and
she
felt
his
solicitude
his
heavy
gun
swinging
low
struck
her
as
she
stepped
down

into
the
stage
and
hauled

bill
as
he
began
to
whip
the
reins
bo
said
quite
distinctly
but
helen
could
only
murmur
hers
the
old
driver
seemed
a
friend
then
the
horses
wheeled
and
stamped
the
stage
careened
and
creaked
presently
to
roll
out
of
sight
in
the
gloom
you
shiverin
said
dale
suddenly
looking
down
upon
helen
she
felt
his
big
hard
hand
clasp
hers
cold
as
ice
i
am
replied
helen
i
guess
we
not
warmly

we
roasted

to

cold

we
heavy
gloves
and
boots
all
fine
and
new
in
this
black
bag

bo
enthusiastically
kicking
a
bag
at
her
feet
yes
so
we

but
a
lot
of
good
they
do
us
returned
helen
miss
you
do
well
to
change
right
here
said
roy
earnestly
save
time
in
the
long
run
an
a
lot
of
sufferin
before
helen
stared
at
the
young
man
absolutely
amazed
with
his
simplicity
she
was
advised
to
change
her
for
a
out
somewhere
in
a
cold
windy
desert
in
the
middle
of
the
night
among
strange
young
men
bo
which
bag
is
it
asked
dale
as
if
she
were
his
sister
and
when
she
indicated
the
one
he
picked
it
up
come
off
the
bo
followed
him
and
helen
found
herself
mechanically
at
their
heels
dale
led
them
a
few
paces
off
the
road
behind
some
low
bushes
hurry
an
change
here
he
said
we
make
a
pack
of
your
outfit
leave
room
for
this
then
he
stalked
away
and
in
a
few
strides
disappeared
bo
sat
down
to
begin
unlacing
her
shoes
helen
could
just
see
her
pale
pretty
face
and
big
gleaming
eyes
by
the
light
of
the
stars
it
struck
her
then
that
bo
was
going
to
make
eminently
more
of
a
success
of
western
life
than
she
was
nell
those
fellows
are
said
bo
reflectively
are
you
say
he
said
hurry
it
was
beyond
helen
comprehension
how
she
ever
began
to
disrobe
out
there
in
that
open
windy
desert
but
after
she
had
gotten
launched
on
the
task
she
found
that
it
required
more
fortitude
than
courage
the
cold
wind
pierced
right
through
her
almost
she
could
have
laughed
at
the
way
bo
made
things
fly
chattered
bo
i
so
in
all
my
life
nell
rayner
the
lord
forgive
helen
was
too
intent
on
her
own
troubles
to
take
breath
to
talk
she
was
a
strong
healthy
girl
swift
and
efficient
with
her
hands
yet
this
the
hardest
physical
ordeal
she
had
ever
experienced
almost
overcame
her
bo
outdistanced
her
by
moments
helped
her
with
buttons
and
laced
one
whole
boot
for
her
then
with
hands
that
stung
helen
packed
the
in
the
bag
there
but
what
an
awful
mess
exclaimed
helen
oh
bo
our
pretty
we
press
them
on
a
replied
bo
and
she
giggled
they
started
for
the
road
bo
strange
to
note
did
not
carry
her
share
of
the
burden
and
she
seemed
unsteady
on
her
feet
the
men
were
waiting
beside
a
group
of
horses
one
of
which
carried
a
pack
nothin
slow
about
you
said
dale
relieving
helen
of
the
grip
roy
put
them
up
while
i
sling
on
this
roy
led
out
two
of
the
horses
get
up
he
said
indicating
bo
the
stirrups
are
short
on
this
bo
was
an
adept
at
mounting
but
she
made
such
awkward
and
slow
work
of
it
in
this
instance
that
helen
could
not
believe
her
eyes
haw
the
stirrups
asked
roy
stand
in
them
guess
they
about
right
careful
now
thet
hoss
is
skittish
hold
him
bo
was
not
living
up
to
the
reputation
with
which
helen
had
credited
her
now
miss
you
get
up
said
roy
to
helen
and
in
another
instant
she
found
herself
astride
a
black
spirited
horse
numb
with
cold
as
she
was
she
yet
felt
the
coursing
thrills
along
her
veins
roy
was
at
the
stirrups
with
swift
hands
you
taller
i
guessed
he
said
stay
up
but
lift
your
foot
shore
now
i
glad
you
have
them
thick
soft
boots
mebbe
we
ride
all
over
the
white
bo
do
you
hear
that
called
helen
but
bo
did
not
answer
she
was
leaning
rather
unnaturally
in
her
saddle
helen
became
anxious
just
then
dale
strode
back
to
them
all
cinched
up
roy
jest
ready
replied
roy
then
dale
stood
beside
helen
how
tall
he
was
his
wide
shoulders
seemed
on
a
level
with
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
he
put
an
affectionate
hand
on
the
horse
his
name
ranger
an
he
the
fastest
an
finest
horse
in
this
i
reckon
he
shore
is
along
with
my
bay
corroborated
roy
roy
if
you
rode
ranger
he
beat
your
pet
said
dale
we
can
start
now
roy
you
drive
the
he
took
another
look
at
helen
saddle
and
then
moved
to
do
likewise
with
bo
are
you
all
right
he
asked
quickly
bo
reeled
in
her
seat
i
froze
she
replied
in
a
faint
voice
her
face
shone
white
in
the
starlight
helen
recognized
that
bo
was
more
than
cold
oh
bo
she
called
in
distress
nell
do
you
worry
let
me
carry
you
suggested
dale
no
i
on
this
horse
or
fiercely
retorted
bo
the
two
men
looked
up
at
her
white
face
and
then
at
each
other
then
roy
walked
away
toward
the
dark
bunch
of
horses
off
the
road
and
dale
swung
astride
the
one
horse
left
keep
close
to
me
he
said
bo
fell
in
line
and
helen
brought
up
the
rear
helen
imagined
she
was
near
the
end
of
a
dream
presently
she
would
awaken
with
a
start
and
see
the
pale
walls
of
her
little
room
at
home
and
hear
the
cherry
branches
brushing
her
window
and
the
old
cock
proclaim
the
hour
of
dawn
chapter
vi
the
horses
trotted
and
the
exercise
soon
warmed
helen
until
she
was
fairly
comfortable
except
in
her
fingers
in
mind
however
she
grew
more
miserable
as
she
more
fully
realized
her
situation
the
night
now
became
so
dark
that
although
the
head
of
her
horse
was
alongside
the
flank
of
bo
she
could
scarcely
see
bo
from
time
to
time
anxious
query
brought
from
her
sister
the
answer
that
she
was
all
right
helen
had
not
ridden
a
horse
for
more
than
a
year
and
for
several
years
she
had
not
ridden
with
any
regularity
despite
her
thrills
upon
mounting
she
had
entertained
misgivings
but
she
was
agreeably
surprised
for
the
horse
ranger
had
an
easy
gait
and
she
found
she
had
not
forgotten
how
to
ride
bo
having
been
used
to
riding
on
a
farm
near
home
might
be
expected
to
acquit
herself
admirably
it
occurred
to
helen
what
a
plight
they
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
thick
comfortable
riding
outfits
dark
as
the
night
was
helen
could
dimly
make
out
the
road
underneath
it
was
rocky
and
apparently
little
used
when
dale
turned
off
the
road
into
the
low
brush
or
sage
of
what
seemed
a
level
plain
the
traveling
was
harder
rougher
and
yet
no
slower
the
horses
kept
to
the
gait
of
the
leaders
helen
discovering
it
unnecessary
ceased
attempting
to
guide
ranger
there
were
dim
shapes
in
the
gloom
ahead
and
always
they
gave
helen
uneasiness
until
closer
approach
proved
them
to
be
rocks
or
low
scrubby
trees
these
increased
in
both
size
and
number
as
the
horses
progressed
often
helen
looked
back
into
the
gloom
behind
this
act
was
involuntary
and
occasioned
her
sensations
of
dread
dale
expected
to
be
pursued
and
helen
experienced
along
with
the
dread
flashes
of
unfamiliar
resentment
not
only
was
there
an
attempt
afoot
to
rob
her
of
her
heritage
but
even
her
personal
liberty
then
she
shuddered
at
the
significance
of
dale
words
regarding
her
possible
abduction
by
this
hired
gang
it
seemed
monstrous
impossible
yet
manifestly
it
was
true
enough
to
dale
and
his
allies
the
west
then
in
reality
was
raw
hard
inevitable
suddenly
her
horse
stopped
he
had
come
up
alongside
bo
horse
dale
had
halted
ahead
and
apparently
was
listening
roy
and
the
were
out
of
sight
in
the
gloom
what
is
it
whispered
helen
reckon
i
heard
a
wolf
replied
dale
was
that
cry
a
wolf
asked
bo
i
heard
it
was
we
gettin
up
close
to
the
said
dale
feel
how
much
colder
the
air
i
warm
now
replied
bo
i
guess
being
near
froze
was
what
ailed
me
nell
how
you
i
warm
too
but
helen
answered
if
you
had
your
choice
of
being
here
or
back
home
snug
in
bed
which
would
you
take
asked
bo
bo
exclaimed
helen
aghast
well
i
choose
to
be
right
here
on
this
horse
rejoined
bo
dale
heard
her
for
he
turned
an
instant
then
slapped
his
horse
and
started
on
helen
now
rode
beside
bo
and
for
a
long
time
they
climbed
steadily
in
silence
helen
knew
when
that
dark
hour
before
dawn
had
passed
and
she
welcomed
an
almost
imperceptible
lightening
in
the
east
then
the
stars
paled
gradually
a
grayness
absorbed
all
but
the
larger
stars
the
great
white
morning
star
wonderful
as
helen
had
never
seen
it
lost
its
brilliance
and
life
and
seemed
to
retreat
into
the
dimming
blue
daylight
came
gradually
so
that
the
gray
desert
became
distinguishable
by
degrees
rolling
bare
hills
half
obscured
by
the
gray
lifting
mantle
of
night
rose
in
the
foreground
and
behind
was
gray
space
slowly
taking
form
and
substance
in
the
east
there
was
a
kindling
of
pale
rose
and
silver
that
lengthened
and
brightened
along
a
horizon
growing
visibly
rugged
reckon
we
better
catch
up
with
roy
said
dale
and
he
spurred
his
horse
ranger
and
bo
mount
needed
no
other
urging
and
they
swung
into
a
canter
far
ahead
the
showed
with
roy
driving
them
the
cold
wind
was
so
keen
in
helen
face
that
tears
blurred
her
eyes
and
froze
her
cheeks
and
riding
ranger
at
that
pace
was
like
riding
in
a
that
ride
invigorating
and
exciting
seemed
all
too
short
oh
nell
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
exclaimed
bo
breathlessly
her
face
was
white
and
red
fresh
as
a
rose
her
eyes
glanced
darkly
blue
her
hair
blew
out
in
bright
unruly
strands
helen
knew
she
felt
some
of
the
physical
stimulation
that
had
so
roused
bo
and
seemed
so
irresistible
but
somber
thought
was
not
deflected
thereby
it
was
clear
daylight
when
roy
led
off
round
a
knoll
from
which
patches
of
scrubby
trees
cedars
dale
called
them
straggled
up
on
the
side
of
the
they
grow
on
the
north
slopes
where
the
snow
stays
longest
said
dale
they
descended
into
a
valley
that
looked
shallow
but
proved
to
be
deep
and
wide
and
then
began
to
climb
another
upon
surmounting
it
helen
saw
the
rising
sun
and
so
glorious
a
view
confronted
her
that
she
was
unable
to
answer
bo
wild
exclamations
bare
yellow
slopes
apparently
level
so
gradual
was
the
ascent
stretched
away
to
a
dense
ragged
line
of
forest
that
rose
black
over
range
after
range
at
last
to
fail
near
the
bare
summit
of
a
magnificent
mountain
against
the
blue
sky
oh
beautiful
cried
bo
but
they
ought
to
be
called
black
old
baldy
there
is
white
half
the
year
replied
dale
look
back
an
see
what
you
say
suggested
roy
the
girls
turned
to
gaze
silently
helen
imagined
she
looked
down
upon
the
whole
wide
world
how
vastly
different
was
the
desert
verily
it
yawned
away
from
her
red
and
gold
near
at
hand
growing
softly
flushed
with
purple
far
away
a
barren
void
borderless
and
immense
where
patches
and
black
lines
and
upheaved
ridges
only
served
to
emphasize
distance
and
space
see
thet
little
green
spot
said
roy
pointing
thet
snowdrop
the
other
one
to
the
right
thet
show
where
is
pine
queried
helen
eagerly
farther
still
up
over
the
at
the
edge
of
the
then
we
riding
away
from
yes
if
we
gone
straight
for
pine
thet
gang
could
overtake
us
pine
is
four
days
ride
an
by
takin
to
the
mountains
milt
can
hide
his
tracks
an
when
he
thrown
anson
off
the
scent
then
he
circle
down
to
mr
dale
do
you
think
you
get
us
there
safely
and
soon
asked
helen
wistfully
i
wo
promise
soon
but
i
promise
safe
an
i
do
like
bein
called
mister
he
replied
are
we
ever
going
to
eat
inquired
bo
demurely
at
this
query
roy
beeman
turned
with
a
laugh
to
look
at
bo
helen
saw
his
face
fully
in
the
light
and
it
was
thin
and
hard
darkly
bronzed
with
eyes
like
those
of
a
hawk
and
with
square
chin
and
lean
jaws
showing
scant
light
beard
we
shore
are
he
replied
soon
as
we
reach
the
timber
thet
wo
be
reckon
we
can
rustle
some
an
then
take
a
good
rest
said
dale
and
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
during
a
steady
trot
for
a
long
hour
helen
roving
eyes
were
everywhere
taking
note
of
the
things
from
near
to
far
the
scant
sage
that
soon
gave
place
to
as
scanty
a
grass
and
the
dark
blots
that
proved
to
be
dwarf
cedars
and
the
ravines
opening
out
as
if
by
magic
from
what
had
appeared
level
ground
to
wind
away
widening
between
gray
stone
walls
and
farther
on
patches
of
lonely
two
and
three
together
and
then
a
straggling
clump
of
yellow
aspens
and
up
beyond
the
fringed
border
of
forest
growing
nearer
all
the
while
the
black
sweeping
benches
rising
to
the
noble
dome
of
the
dominant
mountain
of
the
range
no
birds
or
animals
were
seen
in
that
long
ride
up
toward
the
timber
which
fact
seemed
strange
to
helen
the
air
lost
something
of
its
cold
cutting
edge
as
the
sun
rose
higher
and
it
gained
sweeter
tang
of
the
first
faint
suggestion
of
that
fragrance
was
utterly
new
to
helen
yet
it
brought
a
vague
sensation
of
familiarity
and
with
it
an
emotion
as
strange
it
was
as
if
she
had
smelled
that
keen
pungent
tang
long
ago
and
her
physical
sense
caught
it
before
her
memory
the
yellow
plain
had
only
appeared
to
be
level
roy
led
down
into
a
shallow
ravine
where
a
tiny
stream
meandered
and
he
followed
this
around
to
the
left
coming
at
length
to
a
point
where
cedars
and
dwarf
pines
formed
a
little
grove
here
as
the
others
rode
up
he
sat
in
his
saddle
and
waited
we
hang
up
awhile
he
said
reckon
you
tired
i
hungry
but
not
tired
yet
replied
bo
helen
dismounted
to
find
that
walking
was
something
she
had
apparently
lost
the
power
to
do
bo
laughed
at
her
but
she
too
was
awkward
when
once
more
upon
the
ground
then
roy
got
down
helen
was
surprised
to
find
him
lame
he
caught
her
quick
glance
a
hoss
threw
me
once
an
rolled
on
me
only
broke
my
five
ribs
one
arm
an
my
in
two
places
notwithstanding
this
evidence
that
he
was
a
cripple
as
he
stood
there
tall
and
lithe
in
his
homespun
ragged
garments
he
looked
singularly
powerful
and
capable
reckon
walkin
around
would
be
good
for
you
girls
advised
dale
if
you
ai
stiff
yet
you
be
soon
an
walkin
will
help
do
go
far
i
call
when
breakfast
a
little
while
later
the
girls
were
whistled
in
from
their
walk
and
found
and
meal
awaiting
them
roy
was
sitting
like
an
indian
in
front
of
a
tarpaulin
upon
which
was
spread
a
homely
but
substantial
fare
helen
quick
eye
detected
a
cleanliness
and
thoroughness
she
had
scarcely
expected
to
find
in
the
camp
cooking
of
men
of
the
wilds
moreover
the
fare
was
good
she
ate
heartily
and
as
for
bo
appetite
she
was
inclined
to
be
as
much
ashamed
of
that
as
amused
at
it
the
young
men
were
all
eyes
assiduous
in
their
service
to
the
girls
but
speaking
seldom
it
was
not
lost
upon
helen
how
dale
gray
gaze
went
often
down
across
the
open
country
she
divined
apprehension
from
it
rather
than
saw
much
expression
in
it
i
declare
burst
out
bo
when
she
could
not
eat
any
more
this
is
believable
i
dreaming
nell
the
black
horse
you
rode
is
the
prettiest
i
ever
ranger
with
the
other
animals
was
grazing
along
the
little
brook
packs
and
saddles
had
been
removed
the
men
ate
leisurely
there
was
little
evidence
of
hurried
flight
yet
helen
could
not
cast
off
uneasiness
roy
might
have
been
deep
and
careless
with
a
motive
to
spare
the
girls
anxiety
but
dale
seemed
incapable
of
anything
he
did
not
absolutely
mean
rest
or
walk
he
advised
the
girls
we
got
forty
miles
to
ride
before
helen
preferred
to
rest
but
bo
walked
about
petting
the
horses
and
prying
into
the
packs
she
was
curious
and
eager
dale
and
roy
talked
in
low
tones
while
they
cleaned
up
the
utensils
and
packed
them
away
in
a
heavy
canvas
bag
you
really
expect
anson
strike
my
trail
this
mornin
dale
was
asking
i
shore
do
replied
roy
an
how
do
you
figure
that
so
soon
how
you
figure
it
if
you
was
snake
anson
queried
roy
in
reply
depends
on
that
rider
from
magdalena
said
dale
soberly
although
it
likely
i
seen
them
wheel
tracks
an
hoss
tracks
made
where
we
turned
off
but
supposin
he
milt
listen
i
told
you
snake
met
us
boys
face
to
face
day
before
yesterday
in
show
down
an
he
was
plumb
but
he
missed
seein
or
hearin
about
me
replied
dale
mebbe
he
did
an
mebbe
he
did
anyway
what
the
difference
whether
he
finds
out
this
mornin
or
this
evenin
then
you
ai
expectin
a
fight
if
anson
holds
up
the
stage
wal
he
have
to
shoot
first
which
ai
likely
john
an
hal
since
thet
a
year
ago
have
been
sort
of
joe
might
get
riled
but
i
reckon
the
best
we
can
be
shore
of
is
a
delay
an
be
sense
not
to
count
on
then
you
hang
up
here
an
keep
watch
for
anson
gang
say
long
enough
so
to
be
sure
they
be
in
sight
if
they
find
our
tracks
this
mornin
makin
sure
one
way
or
another
you
ride
to
big
spring
where
i
camp
roy
nodded
approval
of
that
suggestion
then
without
more
words
both
men
picked
up
ropes
and
went
after
the
horses
helen
was
watching
dale
so
that
when
bo
cried
out
in
great
excitement
helen
turned
to
see
a
savage
yellow
little
mustang
standing
straight
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
pawing
the
air
roy
had
roped
him
and
was
now
dragging
him
into
camp
nell
look
at
that
for
a
wild
pony
exclaimed
bo
helen
busied
herself
getting
well
out
of
the
way
of
the
infuriated
mustang
roy
dragged
him
to
a
cedar
near
by
come
now
buckskin
said
roy
soothingly
and
he
slowly
approached
the
quivering
animal
he
went
closer
hand
over
hand
on
the
lasso
buckskin
showed
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
also
his
white
teeth
but
he
stood
while
roy
loosened
the
loop
and
slipping
it
down
over
his
head
fastened
it
in
a
complicated
knot
round
his
nose
thet
a
hackamore
he
said
indicating
the
knot
he
never
had
a
bridle
an
never
will
have
one
i
you
do
ride
him
queried
helen
sometimes
i
do
replied
roy
with
a
smile
would
you
girls
like
to
try
him
excuse
me
answered
helen
gee
ejaculated
bo
he
looks
like
a
devil
but
i
tackle
him
if
you
think
i
the
wild
leaven
of
the
west
had
found
quick
root
in
bo
rayner
wal
i
sorry
but
i
reckon
i
not
let
you
for
a
spell
replied
roy
dryly
he
pitches
somethin
powerful
pitches
you
mean
bucks
i
in
the
next
helen
saw
more
and
learned
more
about
how
horses
of
the
open
range
were
handled
than
she
had
ever
heard
of
excepting
ranger
and
roy
bay
and
the
white
pony
bo
rode
the
rest
of
the
horses
had
actually
to
be
roped
and
hauled
into
camp
to
be
saddled
and
packed
it
was
a
job
for
fearless
strong
men
and
one
that
called
for
patience
as
well
as
arms
of
iron
so
that
for
helen
rayner
the
thing
succeeding
the
confidence
she
had
placed
in
these
men
was
respect
to
an
observing
woman
that
told
much
when
all
was
in
readiness
for
a
start
dale
mounted
and
said
significantly
roy
i
look
for
you
about
sundown
i
hope
no
wal
it
be
bad
if
i
had
to
rustle
along
soon
with
bad
news
hope
for
the
best
we
been
shore
lucky
so
far
now
you
take
to
the
in
the
woods
an
hide
your
dale
turned
away
then
the
girls
bade
roy
and
followed
soon
roy
and
his
mustang
were
lost
to
sight
round
a
clump
of
trees
the
unhampered
horses
led
the
way
the
trotted
after
them
the
riders
were
close
behind
all
traveled
at
a
and
this
gait
made
the
packs
bob
up
and
down
and
from
side
to
side
the
sun
felt
warm
at
helen
back
and
the
wind
lost
its
frosty
coldness
that
almost
appeared
damp
for
a
dry
sweet
fragrance
dale
drove
up
the
shallow
valley
that
showed
timber
on
the
levels
above
and
a
black
border
of
timber
some
few
miles
ahead
it
did
not
take
long
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
forest
helen
wondered
why
the
big
pines
grew
so
far
on
that
plain
and
no
farther
probably
the
growth
had
to
do
with
snow
but
as
the
ground
was
level
she
could
not
see
why
the
edge
of
the
woods
should
come
just
there
they
rode
into
the
forest
to
helen
it
seemed
a
strange
critical
entrance
into
another
world
which
she
was
destined
to
know
and
to
love
the
pines
were
big
seamed
and
knotted
with
no
typical
conformation
except
a
majesty
and
beauty
they
grew
far
apart
few
small
pines
and
little
underbrush
flourished
beneath
them
the
floor
of
this
forest
appeared
remarkable
in
that
it
consisted
of
patches
of
high
silvery
grass
and
wide
brown
areas
of
these
manifestly
were
what
roy
had
meant
by
here
and
there
a
fallen
monarch
lay
riven
or
rotting
helen
was
presently
struck
with
the
silence
of
the
forest
and
the
strange
fact
that
the
horses
seldom
made
any
sound
at
all
and
when
they
did
it
was
a
cracking
of
dead
twig
or
thud
of
hoof
on
log
likewise
she
became
aware
of
a
springy
nature
of
the
ground
and
then
she
saw
that
the
gave
like
rubber
cushions
under
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
and
after
they
had
passed
sprang
back
to
place
again
leaving
no
track
helen
could
not
see
a
sign
of
a
trail
they
left
behind
indeed
it
would
take
a
sharp
eye
to
follow
dale
through
that
forest
this
knowledge
was
infinitely
comforting
to
helen
and
for
the
first
time
since
the
flight
had
begun
she
felt
a
lessening
of
the
weight
upon
mind
and
heart
it
left
her
free
for
some
of
the
appreciation
she
might
have
had
in
this
wonderful
ride
under
happier
circumstances
bo
however
seemed
too
young
too
wild
too
intense
to
mind
what
the
circumstances
were
she
responded
to
reality
helen
began
to
suspect
that
the
girl
would
welcome
any
adventure
and
helen
knew
surely
now
that
bo
was
a
true
auchincloss
for
three
long
days
helen
had
felt
a
constraint
with
which
heretofore
she
had
been
unfamiliar
for
the
last
hours
it
had
been
submerged
under
dread
but
it
must
be
she
concluded
blood
like
her
sister
pounding
at
her
veins
to
be
set
free
to
race
and
to
burn
bo
loved
action
she
had
an
eye
for
beauty
but
she
was
not
contemplative
she
was
now
helping
dale
drive
the
horses
and
hold
them
in
rather
close
formation
she
rode
well
and
as
yet
showed
no
symptoms
of
fatigue
or
pain
helen
began
to
be
aware
of
both
but
not
enough
yet
to
limit
her
interest
a
wonderful
forest
without
birds
did
not
seem
real
to
her
of
all
living
creatures
in
nature
helen
liked
birds
best
and
she
knew
many
and
could
imitate
the
songs
of
a
few
but
here
under
the
stately
pines
there
were
no
birds
squirrels
however
began
to
be
seen
here
and
there
and
in
the
course
of
an
hour
travel
became
abundant
the
only
one
with
which
she
was
familiar
was
the
chipmunk
all
the
others
from
the
slim
bright
blacks
to
the
striped
russets
and
the
grays
were
totally
new
to
her
they
appeared
tame
and
curious
the
reds
barked
and
scolded
at
the
passing
cavalcade
the
blacks
glided
to
some
safe
branch
there
to
watch
the
grays
paid
no
especial
heed
to
this
invasion
of
their
domain
once
dale
halting
his
horse
pointed
with
long
arm
and
helen
following
the
direction
descried
several
gray
deer
standing
in
a
glade
motionless
with
long
ears
up
they
made
a
wild
and
beautiful
picture
suddenly
they
bounded
away
with
remarkable
springy
strides
the
forest
on
the
whole
held
to
the
level
open
character
but
there
were
swales
and
breaking
up
its
regular
conformity
toward
noon
however
it
gradually
changed
a
fact
that
helen
believed
she
might
have
observed
sooner
had
she
been
more
keen
the
general
lay
of
the
land
began
to
ascend
and
the
trees
to
grow
denser
she
made
another
discovery
ever
since
she
had
entered
the
forest
she
had
become
aware
of
a
fullness
in
her
head
and
a
something
affecting
her
nostrils
she
imagined
with
regret
that
she
had
taken
cold
but
presently
her
head
cleared
somewhat
and
she
realized
that
the
thick
pine
odor
of
the
forest
had
clogged
her
nostrils
as
if
with
a
sweet
pitch
the
smell
was
overpowering
and
disagreeable
because
of
its
strength
also
her
throat
and
lungs
seemed
to
burn
when
she
began
to
lose
interest
in
the
forest
and
her
surroundings
it
was
because
of
aches
and
pains
which
would
no
longer
be
denied
recognition
thereafter
she
was
not
permitted
to
forget
them
and
they
grew
worse
one
especially
was
a
pain
beyond
all
her
experience
it
lay
in
the
muscles
of
her
side
above
her
hip
and
it
grew
to
be
a
treacherous
thing
for
it
was
not
persistent
it
came
and
went
after
it
did
come
with
a
terrible
flash
it
could
be
borne
by
shifting
or
easing
the
body
but
it
gave
no
warning
when
she
expected
it
she
was
mistaken
when
she
dared
to
breathe
again
then
with
piercing
swiftness
it
returned
like
a
blade
in
her
side
this
then
was
one
of
the
that
made
a
victim
of
a
tenderfoot
on
a
long
ride
it
was
almost
too
much
to
be
borne
the
beauty
of
the
forest
the
living
creatures
to
be
seen
scurrying
away
the
time
distance
everything
faded
before
that
stablike
pain
to
her
infinite
relief
she
found
that
it
was
the
trot
that
caused
this
torture
when
ranger
walked
she
did
not
have
to
suffer
it
therefore
she
held
him
to
a
walk
as
long
as
she
dared
or
until
dale
and
bo
were
almost
out
of
sight
then
she
loped
him
ahead
until
he
had
caught
up
so
the
hours
passed
the
sun
got
around
low
sending
golden
shafts
under
the
trees
and
the
forest
gradually
changed
to
a
brighter
but
a
thicker
color
this
slowly
darkened
sunset
was
not
far
away
she
heard
the
horses
splashing
in
water
and
soon
she
rode
up
to
see
the
tiny
streams
of
crystal
water
running
swiftly
over
beds
of
green
moss
she
crossed
a
number
of
these
and
followed
along
the
last
one
into
a
more
open
place
in
the
forest
where
the
pines
were
huge
towering
and
far
apart
a
low
gray
bluff
of
stone
rose
to
the
right
perhaps
as
high
as
the
trees
from
somewhere
came
the
rushing
sound
of
running
water
big
spring
announced
dale
we
camp
here
you
girls
have
done
another
glance
proved
to
helen
that
all
those
little
streams
poured
from
under
this
gray
bluff
i
dying
for
a
drink
cried
bo
with
her
customary
hyperbole
i
reckon
you
never
forget
your
first
drink
here
remarked
dale
bo
essayed
to
dismount
and
finally
fell
off
and
when
she
did
get
to
the
ground
her
legs
appeared
to
refuse
their
natural
function
and
she
fell
flat
dale
helped
her
up
what
wrong
with
me
anyhow
she
demanded
in
great
amaze
just
stiff
i
reckon
replied
dale
as
he
led
her
a
few
awkward
steps
bo
have
you
any
hurts
queried
helen
who
still
sat
her
horse
loath
to
try
dismounting
yet
wanting
to
beyond
all
words
bo
gave
her
an
eloquent
glance
nell
did
you
have
one
in
your
side
like
a
wicked
long
punching
deep
when
you
were
ready
that
one
i
never
get
over
exclaimed
helen
softly
then
profiting
by
bo
experience
she
dismounted
cautiously
and
managed
to
keep
upright
her
legs
felt
like
wooden
things
presently
the
girls
went
toward
the
spring
drink
slow
called
out
dale
big
spring
had
its
source
somewhere
deep
under
the
gray
weathered
bluff
from
which
came
a
hollow
subterranean
gurgle
and
roar
of
water
its
fountainhead
must
have
been
a
great
well
rushing
up
through
the
cold
stone
helen
and
bo
lay
flat
on
a
mossy
bank
seeing
their
faces
as
they
bent
over
and
they
sipped
a
mouthful
by
dale
advice
and
because
they
were
so
hot
and
parched
and
burning
they
wanted
to
tarry
a
moment
with
a
precious
opportunity
the
water
was
so
cold
that
it
sent
a
shock
over
helen
made
her
teeth
ache
and
a
singular
revivifying
current
steal
all
through
her
wonderful
in
its
cool
absorption
of
that
dry
heat
of
flesh
irresistible
in
its
appeal
to
thirst
helen
raised
her
head
to
look
at
this
water
it
was
colorless
as
she
had
found
it
tasteless
nell
drink
panted
bo
think
of
our
old
spring
in
the
orchard
full
of
pollywogs
and
then
helen
drank
thirstily
with
closed
eyes
while
a
memory
of
home
stirred
from
bo
gift
of
poignant
speech
chapter
vii
the
first
camp
duty
dale
performed
was
to
throw
a
pack
off
one
of
the
horses
and
opening
it
he
took
out
tarpaulin
and
blankets
which
he
arranged
on
the
ground
under
a
you
girls
rest
he
said
briefly
ca
we
help
asked
helen
though
she
could
scarcely
stand
you
be
welcome
to
do
all
you
like
after
you
broke
broke
in
ejaculated
bo
with
a
little
laugh
i
all
broke
up
bo
it
looks
as
if
dale
expects
us
to
have
quite
a
stay
with
him
in
the
it
does
replied
bo
as
slowly
she
sat
down
upon
the
blankets
stretched
out
with
a
long
sigh
and
laid
her
head
on
a
saddle
nell
did
he
say
not
to
call
him
mister
dale
was
throwing
the
packs
off
the
other
horses
helen
lay
down
beside
bo
and
then
for
once
in
her
life
she
experienced
the
sweetness
of
rest
well
sister
what
do
you
intend
to
call
him
queried
helen
curiously
milt
of
course
replied
bo
helen
had
to
laugh
despite
her
weariness
and
aches
i
suppose
then
when
your
las
vegas
cowboy
comes
along
you
will
call
him
what
he
called
bo
blushed
which
was
a
rather
unusual
thing
for
her
i
will
if
i
like
she
retorted
nell
ever
since
i
could
remember
you
raved
about
the
west
now
you
out
west
right
in
it
good
and
deep
so
wake
up
that
was
bo
blunt
and
characteristic
way
of
advising
the
elimination
of
helen
superficialities
it
sank
deep
helen
had
no
retort
her
ambition
as
far
as
the
west
was
concerned
had
most
assuredly
not
been
for
such
a
wild
jaunt
as
this
but
possibly
the
west
a
living
from
day
to
day
was
one
succession
of
adventures
trials
tests
troubles
and
achievements
to
make
a
place
for
others
to
live
comfortably
some
day
that
might
be
bo
meaning
embodied
in
her
forceful
hint
but
helen
was
too
tired
to
think
it
out
then
she
found
it
interesting
and
vaguely
pleasant
to
watch
dale
he
hobbled
the
horses
and
turned
them
loose
then
with
ax
in
hand
he
approached
a
short
dead
tree
standing
among
a
few
aspens
dale
appeared
to
advantage
swinging
the
ax
with
his
coat
off
displaying
his
wide
shoulders
straight
back
and
long
powerful
arms
he
looked
a
young
giant
he
was
lithe
and
supple
brawny
but
not
bulky
the
ax
rang
on
the
hard
wood
reverberating
through
the
forest
a
few
strokes
sufficed
to
bring
down
the
stub
then
he
split
it
up
helen
was
curious
to
see
how
he
kindled
a
fire
first
he
ripped
splinters
out
of
the
heart
of
the
log
and
laid
them
with
coarser
pieces
on
the
ground
then
from
a
saddlebag
which
hung
on
a
branch
he
took
flint
and
steel
and
a
piece
of
what
helen
supposed
was
rag
or
buckskin
upon
which
powder
had
been
rubbed
at
any
rate
the
first
strike
of
the
steel
brought
sparks
a
blaze
and
burning
splinters
instantly
the
flame
leaped
a
foot
high
he
put
on
larger
pieces
of
wood
crosswise
and
the
fire
roared
that
done
he
stood
erect
and
facing
the
north
he
listened
helen
remembered
now
that
she
had
seen
him
do
the
same
thing
twice
before
since
the
arrival
at
big
spring
it
was
roy
for
whom
he
was
listening
and
watching
the
sun
had
set
and
across
the
open
space
the
tips
of
the
pines
were
losing
their
brightness
the
camp
utensils
which
the
hunter
emptied
out
of
a
sack
gave
forth
a
jangle
of
iron
and
tin
next
he
unrolled
a
large
pack
the
contents
of
which
appeared
to
be
numerous
sacks
of
all
sizes
these
evidently
contained
food
supplies
the
bucket
looked
as
if
a
horse
had
rolled
over
it
pack
and
all
dale
filled
it
at
the
spring
upon
returning
to
the
he
poured
water
into
a
washbasin
and
getting
down
to
his
knees
proceeded
to
wash
his
hands
thoroughly
the
act
seemed
a
habit
for
helen
saw
that
while
he
was
doing
it
he
gazed
off
into
the
woods
and
listened
then
he
dried
his
hands
over
the
fire
and
turning
to
the
pack
he
began
preparations
for
the
meal
suddenly
helen
thought
of
the
man
and
all
that
his
actions
implied
at
magdalena
on
the
and
last
night
she
had
trusted
this
stranger
a
hunter
of
the
white
mountains
who
appeared
ready
to
befriend
her
and
she
had
felt
an
exceeding
gratitude
still
she
had
looked
at
him
impersonally
but
it
began
to
dawn
upon
her
that
chance
had
thrown
her
in
the
company
of
a
remarkable
man
that
impression
baffled
her
it
did
not
spring
from
the
fact
that
he
was
brave
and
kind
to
help
a
young
woman
in
peril
or
that
he
appeared
deft
and
quick
at
chores
most
western
men
were
brave
her
uncle
had
told
her
and
many
were
roughly
kind
and
all
of
them
could
cook
this
hunter
was
physically
a
wonderful
specimen
of
manhood
with
something
leonine
about
his
stature
but
that
did
not
give
rise
to
her
impression
helen
had
been
a
and
used
to
boys
and
she
sensed
a
boyish
simplicity
or
vigor
or
freshness
in
this
hunter
she
believed
however
that
it
was
a
mental
and
spiritual
force
in
dale
which
had
drawn
her
to
think
of
it
nell
i
spoken
to
you
three
times
protested
bo
petulantly
what
you
mooning
over
i
pretty
tired
and
far
away
bo
replied
helen
what
did
you
say
i
said
i
had
an
really
that
not
remarkable
for
you
i
too
tired
to
eat
and
afraid
to
shut
my
eyes
they
never
come
open
when
did
we
sleep
last
bo
second
night
before
we
left
home
declared
bo
four
nights
oh
we
slept
i
bet
i
make
mine
up
in
this
woods
do
you
suppose
we
sleep
right
here
under
this
tree
with
no
covering
it
looks
so
replied
helen
dubiously
how
perfectly
lovely
exclaimed
bo
in
delight
we
see
the
stars
through
the
seems
to
be
clouding
over
would
it
be
awful
if
we
had
a
storm
why
i
do
know
answered
bo
thoughtfully
it
must
storm
out
again
helen
felt
a
quality
of
inevitableness
in
bo
it
was
something
that
had
appeared
only
practical
in
the
humdrum
home
life
in
joseph
all
of
a
sudden
helen
received
a
flash
of
wondering
thought
a
thrilling
consciousness
that
she
and
bo
had
begun
to
develop
in
a
new
and
wild
environment
how
strange
and
fearful
perhaps
to
watch
that
growth
bo
being
younger
more
impressionable
with
elemental
rather
than
intellectual
instincts
would
grow
stronger
more
swiftly
helen
wondered
if
she
could
yield
to
her
own
leaning
to
the
primitive
but
how
could
anyone
with
a
thoughtful
and
grasping
mind
yield
that
way
it
was
the
savage
who
did
not
think
helen
saw
dale
stand
erect
once
more
and
gaze
into
the
forest
reckon
roy
ai
comin
he
soliloquized
an
that
then
he
turned
to
the
girls
supper
the
girls
responded
with
a
spirit
greater
than
their
activity
and
they
ate
like
famished
children
that
had
been
lost
in
the
woods
dale
attended
them
with
a
pleasant
light
upon
his
still
face
night
we
have
meat
he
said
what
kind
asked
bo
wild
turkey
or
deer
maybe
both
if
you
like
but
it
well
to
take
wild
meat
slow
an
turkey
that
melt
in
your
uummm
murmured
bo
greedily
i
heard
of
wild
when
they
had
finished
dale
ate
his
meal
listening
to
the
talk
of
the
girls
and
occasionally
replying
briefly
to
some
query
of
bo
it
was
twilight
when
he
began
to
wash
the
pots
and
pans
and
almost
dark
by
the
time
his
duties
appeared
ended
then
he
replenished
the
campfire
and
sat
down
on
a
log
to
gaze
into
the
fire
the
girls
leaned
comfortably
propped
against
the
saddles
nell
i
keel
over
in
a
minute
said
bo
and
i
ought
right
on
such
a
big
i
do
see
how
i
can
sleep
and
i
know
i
ca
stay
awake
rejoined
helen
dale
lifted
his
head
alertly
the
girls
grew
tense
and
still
helen
could
not
hear
a
sound
unless
it
was
a
low
thud
of
hoof
out
in
the
gloom
the
forest
seemed
sleeping
she
knew
from
bo
eyes
wide
and
shining
in
the
light
that
she
too
had
failed
to
catch
whatever
it
was
dale
meant
bunch
of
coyotes
comin
he
explained
suddenly
the
quietness
split
to
a
chorus
of
snappy
strange
barks
they
sounded
wild
yet
they
held
something
of
a
friendly
or
inquisitive
note
presently
gray
forms
could
be
descried
just
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
of
light
soft
rustlings
of
stealthy
feet
surrounded
the
camp
and
then
barks
and
yelps
broke
out
all
around
it
was
a
restless
and
sneaking
pack
of
animals
thought
helen
she
was
glad
after
the
chorus
ended
and
with
a
few
desultory
spiteful
yelps
the
coyotes
went
away
silence
again
settled
down
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
anxiety
always
present
in
helen
mind
she
would
have
thought
this
silence
sweet
and
unfamiliarly
beautiful
ah
listen
to
that
fellow
spoke
up
dale
his
voice
was
thrilling
again
the
girls
strained
their
ears
that
was
not
necessary
for
presently
clear
and
cold
out
of
the
silence
pealed
a
mournful
howl
long
drawn
strange
and
full
and
wild
oh
what
that
whispered
bo
that
a
big
gray
wolf
a
or
lofer
as
he
sometimes
called
replied
dale
he
high
on
some
rocky
ridge
back
there
he
scents
us
an
he
does
like
it
there
he
goes
again
listen
ah
he
while
helen
listened
to
this
exceedingly
wild
cry
so
wild
that
it
made
her
flesh
creep
and
the
most
indescribable
sensations
of
loneliness
come
over
her
she
kept
her
glance
upon
dale
you
love
him
she
murmured
involuntarily
quite
without
understanding
the
motive
of
her
query
assuredly
dale
had
never
had
that
question
asked
of
him
before
and
it
seemed
to
helen
as
he
pondered
that
he
had
never
even
asked
it
of
himself
i
reckon
so
he
replied
presently
but
wolves
kill
deer
and
little
fawns
and
everything
helpless
in
the
forest
expostulated
bo
the
hunter
nodded
his
head
why
then
can
you
love
him
repeated
helen
come
to
think
of
it
i
reckon
it
because
of
lots
of
reasons
returned
dale
he
kills
clean
he
eats
no
carrion
he
no
coward
he
fights
he
dies
game
an
he
likes
to
be
kills
clean
what
do
you
mean
by
that
a
cougar
now
he
mangles
a
deer
an
a
silvertip
when
killin
a
cow
or
colt
he
makes
a
mess
of
it
but
a
wolf
kills
clean
with
sharp
what
are
a
cougar
and
a
silvertip
cougar
means
or
panther
an
a
silvertip
is
a
grizzly
oh
they
all
cruel
exclaimed
helen
shrinking
i
reckon
often
i
shot
wolves
for
relayin
a
what
that
sometimes
two
or
more
wolves
will
run
a
deer
an
while
one
of
them
rests
the
other
will
drive
the
deer
around
to
his
pardner
who
take
up
the
chase
that
way
they
run
the
deer
down
cruel
it
is
but
nature
an
no
worse
than
snow
an
ice
that
starve
deer
or
a
fox
that
kills
breakin
out
of
the
egg
or
ravens
that
pick
the
eyes
out
of
lambs
an
wait
till
they
die
an
for
that
matter
men
are
crueler
than
beasts
of
prey
for
men
add
to
nature
an
have
more
than
helen
was
silenced
as
well
as
shocked
she
had
not
only
learned
a
new
and
striking
viewpoint
in
natural
history
but
a
clear
intimation
to
the
reason
why
she
had
vaguely
imagined
or
divined
a
remarkable
character
in
this
man
a
hunter
was
one
who
killed
animals
for
their
fur
for
their
meat
or
horns
or
for
some
lust
for
blood
that
was
helen
definition
of
a
hunter
and
she
believed
it
was
held
by
the
majority
of
people
living
in
settled
states
but
the
majority
might
be
wrong
a
hunter
might
be
vastly
different
and
vastly
more
than
a
tracker
and
slayer
of
game
the
mountain
world
of
forest
was
a
mystery
to
almost
all
men
perhaps
dale
knew
its
secrets
its
life
its
terror
its
beauty
its
sadness
and
its
joy
and
if
so
how
full
how
wonderful
must
be
his
mind
he
spoke
of
men
as
no
better
than
wolves
could
a
lonely
life
in
the
wilderness
teach
a
man
that
bitterness
envy
jealousy
spite
greed
and
hate
these
had
no
place
in
this
hunter
heart
it
was
not
helen
shrewdness
but
a
woman
intuition
which
divined
that
dale
rose
to
his
feet
and
turning
his
ear
to
the
north
listened
once
more
are
you
expecting
roy
still
inquired
helen
no
it
ai
likely
he
turn
up
replied
dale
and
then
he
strode
over
to
put
a
hand
on
the
that
soared
above
where
the
girls
lay
his
action
and
the
way
he
looked
up
at
the
and
then
at
adjacent
trees
held
more
of
that
significance
which
so
interested
helen
i
reckon
he
stood
there
some
five
hundred
years
an
will
stand
through
muttered
dale
this
pine
was
the
monarch
of
that
group
listen
again
said
dale
bo
was
asleep
and
helen
listening
at
once
caught
low
distant
roar
wind
it
goin
to
storm
explained
dale
you
hear
worth
while
but
do
be
scared
reckon
we
be
safe
pines
blow
down
often
but
this
fellow
will
stand
any
fall
wind
that
ever
was
better
slip
under
the
blankets
so
i
can
pull
the
tarp
helen
slid
down
just
as
she
was
fully
dressed
except
for
boots
which
she
and
bo
had
removed
and
she
laid
her
head
close
to
bo
dale
pulled
the
tarpaulin
up
and
folded
it
back
just
below
their
heads
when
it
rains
you
wake
an
then
just
pull
the
tarp
up
over
you
he
said
will
it
rain
helen
asked
but
she
was
thinking
that
this
moment
was
the
strangest
that
had
ever
happened
to
her
by
the
light
of
the
she
saw
dale
face
just
as
usual
still
darkly
serene
expressing
no
thought
he
was
kind
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
these
sisters
as
girls
alone
with
him
in
a
forest
helpless
and
defenseless
he
did
not
seem
to
be
thinking
at
all
but
helen
had
never
before
in
her
life
been
so
keenly
susceptible
to
experience
i
be
close
by
an
keep
the
fire
goin
all
night
he
said
she
heard
him
stride
off
into
the
darkness
presently
there
came
a
dragging
bumping
sound
then
a
crash
of
a
log
dropped
upon
the
fire
a
cloud
of
sparks
shot
up
and
many
pattered
down
to
hiss
upon
the
damp
ground
smoke
again
curled
upward
along
the
great
seamed
and
flames
sputtered
and
crackled
helen
listened
again
for
the
roar
of
wind
it
seemed
to
come
on
a
breath
of
air
that
fanned
her
cheek
and
softly
blew
bo
curls
and
it
was
stronger
but
it
died
out
presently
only
to
come
again
and
still
stronger
helen
realized
then
that
the
sound
was
that
of
an
approaching
storm
her
heavy
eyelids
almost
refused
to
stay
open
and
she
knew
if
she
let
them
close
she
would
instantly
drop
to
sleep
and
she
wanted
to
hear
the
in
the
pines
a
few
drops
of
cold
rain
fell
upon
her
face
thrilling
her
with
the
proof
that
no
roof
stood
between
her
and
the
elements
then
a
breeze
bore
the
smell
of
burnt
wood
into
her
face
and
somehow
her
quick
mind
flew
to
girlhood
days
when
she
burned
brush
and
leaves
with
her
little
brothers
the
memory
faded
the
roar
that
had
seemed
distant
was
now
back
in
the
forest
coming
swiftly
increasing
in
volume
like
a
stream
in
flood
it
bore
down
helen
grew
amazed
startled
how
rushing
oncoming
and
heavy
this
she
likened
its
approach
to
the
tread
of
an
army
then
the
roar
filled
the
forest
yet
it
was
back
there
behind
her
not
a
quivered
in
the
light
of
the
but
the
air
seemed
to
be
oppressed
with
a
terrible
charge
the
roar
augmented
till
it
was
no
longer
a
roar
but
an
crash
like
an
ocean
torrent
engulfing
the
earth
bo
awoke
to
cling
to
helen
with
fright
the
deafening
was
upon
them
helen
felt
the
move
under
her
head
the
giant
pine
had
trembled
to
its
very
roots
that
mighty
fury
of
wind
was
all
aloft
in
the
and
for
a
long
moment
it
bowed
the
forest
under
its
tremendous
power
then
the
deafening
crash
passed
to
roar
and
that
swept
on
and
on
lessening
in
volume
deepening
in
low
detonation
at
last
to
die
in
the
distance
no
sooner
had
it
died
than
back
to
the
north
another
low
roar
rose
and
ceased
and
rose
again
helen
lay
there
whispering
to
bo
and
heard
again
the
great
wave
of
wind
come
and
crash
and
cease
that
was
the
way
of
this
of
the
mountain
forest
a
soft
patter
of
rain
on
the
tarpaulin
warned
helen
to
remember
directions
and
pulling
up
the
heavy
covering
she
arranged
it
hoodlike
over
the
saddle
then
with
bo
close
and
warm
beside
her
she
closed
her
eyes
and
the
sense
of
the
black
forest
and
the
wind
and
rain
faded
last
of
all
sensations
was
the
smell
of
smoke
that
blew
under
the
tarpaulin
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
remembered
everything
as
if
only
a
moment
had
elapsed
but
it
was
daylight
though
gray
and
cloudy
the
pines
were
dripping
mist
a
fire
crackled
cheerily
and
blue
smoke
curled
upward
and
a
savory
odor
of
hot
coffee
hung
in
the
air
horses
were
standing
near
by
biting
and
kicking
at
one
another
bo
was
sound
asleep
dale
appeared
busy
around
the
as
helen
watched
the
hunter
she
saw
him
pause
in
his
task
turn
his
ear
to
listen
and
then
look
expectantly
and
at
that
juncture
a
shout
pealed
from
the
forest
helen
recognized
roy
voice
then
she
heard
a
splashing
of
water
and
coming
closer
with
that
the
buckskin
mustang
trotted
into
camp
carrying
roy
bad
mornin
for
ducks
but
good
for
us
he
called
howdy
roy
greeted
dale
and
his
gladness
was
unmistakable
i
was
lookin
for
roy
appeared
to
slide
off
the
mustang
without
effort
and
his
swift
hands
slapped
the
straps
as
he
unsaddled
buckskin
was
wet
with
sweat
and
foam
mixed
with
rain
he
heaved
and
steam
rose
from
him
must
have
rode
hard
observed
dale
i
shore
did
replied
roy
then
he
espied
helen
who
had
sat
up
with
hands
to
her
hair
and
eyes
staring
at
him
mornin
miss
it
good
thank
heaven
murmured
helen
and
then
she
shook
bo
that
young
lady
awoke
but
was
loath
to
give
up
slumber
bo
bo
wake
up
roy
is
whereupon
bo
sat
up
disheveled
and
but
i
ache
she
moaned
but
her
eyes
took
in
the
camp
scene
to
the
effect
that
she
added
is
breakfast
ready
almost
an
flapjacks
this
mornin
replied
dale
bo
manifested
active
symptoms
of
health
in
the
manner
with
which
she
laced
her
boots
helen
got
their
and
with
this
they
repaired
to
a
flat
stone
beside
the
spring
not
however
out
of
earshot
of
the
men
how
long
are
you
goin
to
hang
around
camp
before
tellin
me
inquired
dale
jest
as
i
figgered

roy

a
messenger
to
anson

an
his
gang
got
on
our
trail
quick
about
ten
i
seen
them
comin
then
i
lit
out
for
the
woods
i
stayed
off
in
the
woods
close
enough
to
see
where
they
come
in
an
shore
they
lost
your
trail
then
they
spread
through
the
woods
workin
off
to
the
south
thinkin
of
course
thet
you
would
circle
round
to
pine
on
the
south
side
of
old
baldy
there
ai
a
in
snake
gang
thet
shore
wal
i
follered
them
for
an
hour
till
they
rustled
some
miles
off
our
trail
then
i
went
back
to
where
you
struck
into
the
woods
an
i
waited
there
all
afternoon
till
dark
expectin
mebbe
they
but
they
did
i
rode
on
a
ways
an
camped
in
the
woods
till

far

two
or
three
trails

his
outfit

dale
at
some
idea
that
had
struck
him
what

goin
round
the
north
side
of
it
shore
ai
rejoined
roy
bluntly
then
i
got
to
hide
tracks

or

mile
farther

an

certain
i
feel
safe

said
the
hunter
reflectively
shore
an
easy
responded
roy
quickly
i
jest
met
up
with
some
greaser
drivin
a
big
flock
they
come
up
from
the

till

clear
off

scent
leave

to
me
milt
you
a
hunter
but
i
a
all
right
we
then
he
called
the
girls
to
hurry
chapter
viii
once
astride
the
horse
again
helen
had
to
congratulate
herself
upon
not
being
so
crippled
as
she
had
imagined
indeed
bo
made
all
the
audible
complaints
both
girls
had
long
coats
and
of
which
they
were
considerably
proud
new
clothes
had
not
been
a
common
event
in
their
lives
reckon
i
have
to
slit
these
dale
had
said
whipping
out
a
huge
knife
what
for
had
been
bo
feeble
protest
they
was
made
for
ridin
an
you
get
wet
enough
even
if
i
do
cut
them
an
if
i
do
you
get
go
ahead
had
been
helen
reluctant
permission
so
their
long
new
coats
were
slit
up
the
back
the
exigency
of
the
case
was
manifest
to
helen
when
she
saw
how
they
came
down
over
the
cantles
of
the
saddles
and
to
their
the
morning
was
gray
and
cold
a
fine
misty
rain
fell
and
the
trees
dripped
steadily
helen
was
surprised
to
see
the
open
country
again
and
that
apparently
they
were
to
leave
the
forest
behind
for
a
while
the
country
was
wide
and
flat
on
the
right
and
to
the
left
it
rolled
and
heaved
along
a
black
scalloped
above
this
bordering
of
the
forest
low
drifting
clouds
obscured
the
mountains
the
wind
was
at
helen
back
and
seemed
to
be
growing
stronger
dale
and
roy
were
ahead
traveling
at
a
good
trot
with
the
bunched
before
them
helen
and
bo
had
enough
to
do
to
keep
up
the
first
hour
ride
brought
little
change
in
weather
or
scenery
but
it
gave
helen
an
inkling
of
what
she
must
endure
if
they
kept
that
up
all
day
she
began
to
welcome
the
places
where
the
horses
walked
but
she
disliked
the
levels
as
for
the
descents
she
hated
those
ranger
would
not
go
down
slowly
and
the
she
received
was
unpleasant
moreover
the
spirited
black
horse
insisted
on
jumping
the
ditches
and
washes
he
sailed
over
them
like
a
bird
helen
could
not
acquire
the
knack
of
sitting
the
saddle
properly
and
so
not
only
was
her
person
bruised
on
these
occasions
but
her
feelings
were
hurt
helen
had
never
before
been
conscious
of
vanity
still
she
had
never
rejoiced
in
looking
at
a
disadvantage
and
her
exhibitions
here
must
have
been
frightful
bo
always
would
forge
to
the
front
and
she
seldom
looked
back
for
which
helen
was
grateful
before
long
they
struck
into
a
broad
muddy
belt
full
of
innumerable
small
hoof
tracks
this
then
was
the
sheep
trail
roy
had
advised
following
they
rode
on
it
for
three
or
four
miles
and
at
length
coming
to
a
valley
they
saw
a
huge
flock
of
sheep
soon
the
air
was
full
of
bleats
and
baas
as
well
as
the
odor
of
sheep
and
a
low
soft
roar
of
pattering
hoofs
the
flock
held
a
compact
formation
covering
several
acres
and
grazed
along
rapidly
there
were
three
herders
on
horses
and
several
dale
engaged
one
of
the
mexicans
in
conversation
and
passed
something
to
him
then
pointed
northward
and
down
along
the
trail
the
mexican
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
and
helen
caught
the
quick
si
senor
gracias
senor
it
was
a
pretty
sight
that
flock
of
sheep
as
it
rolled
along
like
a
rounded
woolly
stream
of
grays
and
browns
and
here
and
there
a
black
they
were
keeping
to
a
trail
over
the
flats
dale
headed
into
this
trail
and
if
anything
trotted
a
little
faster
presently
the
clouds
lifted
and
broke
showing
blue
sky
and
one
streak
of
sunshine
but
the
augury
was
without
warrant
the
wind
increased
a
huge
black
pall
bore
down
from
the
mountains
and
it
brought
rain
that
could
be
seen
falling
in
sheets
from
above
and
approaching
like
a
swiftly
moving
wall
soon
it
enveloped
the
fugitives
with
head
bowed
helen
rode
along
for
what
seemed
ages
in
a
cold
gray
rain
that
blew
almost
on
a
level
finally
the
heavy
downpour
passed
leaving
a
fine
mist
the
clouds
scurried
low
and
dark
hiding
the
mountains
altogether
and
making
the
gray
wet
plain
a
dreary
sight
helen
feet
and
knees
were
as
wet
as
if
she
had
waded
in
water
and
they
were
cold
her
gloves
too
had
not
been
intended
for
rain
and
they
were
wet
through
the
cold
bit
at
her
fingers
so
that
she
had
to
beat
her
hands
together
ranger
misunderstood
this
to
mean
that
he
was
to
trot
faster
which
event
was
worse
for
helen
than
freezing
she
saw
another
black
scudding
mass
of
clouds
bearing
down
with
its
trailing
sheets
of
rain
and
this
one
appeared
streaked
with
white
snow
the
wind
was
now
piercingly
cold
helen
body
kept
warm
but
her
extremities
and
ears
began
to
suffer
exceedingly
she
gazed
ahead
grimly
there
was
no
help
she
had
to
go
on
dale
and
roy
were
hunched
down
in
their
saddles
probably
wet
through
for
they
wore
no
coats
bo
kept
close
behind
them
and
plain
it
was
that
she
felt
the
cold
this
second
storm
was
not
so
bad
as
the
first
because
there
was
less
rain
still
the
icy
keenness
of
the
wind
bit
into
the
marrow
it
lasted
for
an
hour
during
which
the
horses
trotted
on
trotted
on
again
the
gray
torrent
roared
away
the
fine
mist
blew
the
clouds
lifted
and
separated
and
closing
again
darkened
for
another
onslaught
this
one
brought
sleet
the
driving
pellets
stung
helen
neck
and
cheeks
and
for
a
while
they
fell
so
thick
and
so
hard
upon
her
back
that
she
was
afraid
she
could
not
hold
up
under
them
the
bare
places
on
the
ground
showed
a
sparkling
coverlet
of
marbles
of
ice
thus
storm
after
storm
rolled
over
helen
head
her
feet
grew
numb
and
ceased
to
hurt
but
her
fingers
because
of
her
ceaseless
efforts
to
keep
up
the
circulation
retained
the
stinging
pain
and
now
the
wind
pierced
right
through
her
she
marveled
at
her
endurance
and
there
were
many
times
that
she
believed
she
could
not
ride
farther
yet
she
kept
on
all
the
winters
she
had
ever
lived
had
not
brought
such
a
day
as
this
hard
and
cold
wet
and
windy
at
an
increasing
elevation
that
was
the
explanation
the
air
did
not
have
sufficient
oxygen
for
her
blood
still
during
all
those
interminable
hours
helen
watched
where
she
was
traveling
and
if
she
ever
returned
over
that
trail
she
would
recognize
it
the
afternoon
appeared
far
advanced
when
dale
and
roy
led
down
into
an
immense
basin
where
a
reedy
lake
spread
over
the
flats
they
rode
along
its
margin
splashing
up
to
the
knees
of
the
horses
cranes
and
herons
flew
on
with
lumbering
motion
flocks
of
ducks
winged
swift
flight
from
one
side
to
the
other
beyond
this
depression
the
land
sloped
rather
abruptly
outcroppings
of
rock
circled
along
the
edge
of
the
highest
ground
and
again
a
dark
fringe
of
trees
appeared
how
many
miles
wondered
helen
they
seemed
as
many
and
as
long
as
the
hours
but
at
last
just
as
another
hard
rain
came
the
pines
were
reached
they
proved
to
be
widely
scattered
and
afforded
little
protection
from
the
storm
helen
sat
her
saddle
a
dead
weight
whenever
ranger
quickened
his
gait
or
crossed
a
ditch
she
held
on
to
the
pommel
to
keep
from
falling
off
her
mind
harbored
only
sensations
of
misery
and
a
persistent
thought
why
did
she
ever
leave
home
for
the
west
her
solicitude
for
bo
had
been
forgotten
nevertheless
any
marked
change
in
the
topography
of
the
country
was
registered
perhaps
photographed
on
her
memory
by
the
torturing
vividness
of
her
experience
the
forest
grew
more
level
and
denser
shadows
of
twilight
or
gloom
lay
under
the
trees
presently
dale
and
roy
disappeared
going
downhill
and
likewise
bo
then
helen
ears
suddenly
filled
with
a
roar
of
rapid
water
ranger
trotted
faster
soon
helen
came
to
the
edge
of
a
great
valley
black
and
gray
so
full
of
obscurity
that
she
could
not
see
across
or
down
into
it
but
she
knew
there
was
a
rushing
river
at
the
bottom
the
sound
was
deep
continuous
a
heavy
murmuring
roar
singularly
musical
the
trail
was
steep
helen
had
not
lost
all
feeling
as
she
had
believed
and
hoped
her
poor
mistreated
body
still
responded
excruciatingly
to
concussions
jars
wrenches
and
all
the
other
horrible
movements
making
up
a
for
long
helen
did
not
look
up
when
she
did
so
there
lay
a
green
treeless
space
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
through
which
a
stream
rushed
with
steady
roar
dale
and
roy
drove
the
across
the
stream
and
followed
going
deep
to
the
flanks
of
their
horses
bo
rode
into
the
foaming
water
as
if
she
had
been
used
to
it
all
her
days
a
slip
a
fall
would
have
meant
that
bo
must
drown
in
that
mountain
torrent
ranger
trotted
straight
to
the
edge
and
there
obedient
to
clutch
on
the
bridle
he
halted
the
stream
was
fifty
feet
wide
shallow
on
the
near
side
deep
on
the
opposite
with
fast
current
and
big
waves
helen
was
simply
too
frightened
to
follow
let
him
come
yelled
dale
stick
on
now
ranger
the
big
black
plunged
in
making
the
water
fly
that
stream
was
nothing
for
him
though
it
seemed
impassable
to
helen
she
had
not
the
strength
left
to
lift
her
stirrups
and
the
water
surged
over
them
ranger
in
two
more
plunges
surmounted
the
bank
and
then
trotting
across
the
green
to
where
the
other
horses
stood
steaming
under
some
pines
he
gave
a
great
heave
and
halted
roy
reached
up
to
help
her
off
thirty
miles
miss
helen
he
said
and
the
way
he
spoke
was
a
compliment
he
had
to
lift
her
off
and
help
her
to
the
tree
where
bo
leaned
dale
had
ripped
off
a
saddle
and
was
spreading
on
the
ground
under
the
pine
nell
you
swore
you
loved
me
was
bo
mournful
greeting
the
girl
was
pale
drawn
and
she
could
not
stand
up
bo
i
never
did
or
i
never
have
brought
you
to
this
wretch
that
i
am
cried
helen
oh
what
a
horrible
ride
rain
was
falling
the
trees
were
dripping
the
sky
was
lowering
all
the
ground
was
soaking
wet
with
pools
and
puddles
everywhere
helen
could
imagine
nothing
but
a
heartless
dreary
cold
prospect
just
then
home
was
vivid
and
poignant
in
her
thoughts
indeed
so
utterly
miserable
was
she
that
the
exquisite
relief
of
sitting
down
of
a
cessation
of
movement
of
a
release
from
that
infernal
horse
seemed
only
a
mockery
it
could
not
be
true
that
the
time
had
come
for
rest
evidently
this
place
had
been
a
camp
site
for
hunters
or
for
there
were
remains
of
a
fire
dale
lifted
the
burnt
end
of
a
log
and
brought
it
down
hard
upon
the
ground
splitting
off
pieces
several
times
he
did
this
it
was
amazing
to
see
his
strength
his
facility
as
he
split
off
handfuls
of
splinters
he
collected
a
bundle
of
them
and
laying
them
down
he
bent
over
them
roy
wielded
the
ax
on
another
log
and
each
stroke
split
off
a
long
strip
then
a
tiny
column
of
smoke
drifted
up
over
dale
shoulder
as
he
leaned
bareheaded
sheltering
the
splinters
with
his
hat
a
blaze
leaped
up
roy
came
with
an
armful
of
strips
all
white
and
dry
out
of
the
inside
of
a
log
crosswise
these
were
laid
over
the
blaze
and
it
began
to
roar
then
piece
by
piece
the
men
built
up
a
frame
upon
which
they
added
heavier
woods
branches
and
stumps
and
logs
erecting
a
pyramid
through
which
flames
and
smoke
roared
upward
it
had
not
taken
two
minutes
already
helen
felt
the
warmth
on
her
icy
face
she
held
up
her
bare
numb
hands
both
dale
and
roy
were
wet
through
to
the
skin
yet
they
did
not
tarry
beside
the
fire
they
relieved
the
horses
a
lasso
went
up
between
two
pines
and
a
tarpaulin
over
it
and
pegged
down
at
the
four
ends
the
packs
containing
the
baggage
of
the
girls
and
the
supplies
and
bedding
were
placed
under
this
shelter
helen
thought
this
might
have
taken
five
minutes
more
in
this
short
space
of
time
the
fire
had
leaped
and
flamed
until
it
was
huge
and
hot
rain
was
falling
steadily
all
around
but
over
and
near
that
roaring
blaze
ten
feet
high
no
water
fell
it
evaporated
the
ground
began
to
steam
and
to
dry
helen
suffered
at
first
while
the
heat
was
driving
out
the
cold
but
presently
the
pain
ceased
nell
i
never
knew
before
how
good
a
fire
could
feel
declared
bo
and
therein
lay
more
food
for
helen
reflection
in
ten
minutes
helen
was
dry
and
hot
darkness
came
down
upon
the
dreary
sodden
forest
but
that
great
made
it
a
different
world
from
the
one
helen
had
anticipated
it
blazed
and
roared
cracked
like
a
pistol
hissed
and
sputtered
shot
sparks
everywhere
and
sent
aloft
a
dense
yellow
whirling
column
of
smoke
it
began
to
have
a
heart
of
gold
dale
took
a
long
pole
and
raked
out
a
pile
of
red
embers
upon
which
the
and
oven
soon
began
to
steam
roy
i
promised
the
girls
turkey
said
the
hunter
mebbe
if
the
wind
shifts
this
turkey
roy
a
potato
will
do
me
exclaimed
bo
never
again
will
i
ask
for
cake
and
pie
i
never
appreciated
good
things
to
eat
and
i
been
a
little
pig
always
i
never
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
hungry
until
dale
glanced
up
quickly
lass
it
worth
learnin
he
said
helen
thought
was
too
deep
for
words
in
such
brief
space
had
she
been
transformed
from
misery
to
comfort
the
rain
kept
on
falling
though
it
appeared
to
grow
softer
as
night
settled
down
black
the
wind
died
away
and
the
forest
was
still
except
for
the
steady
roar
of
the
stream
a
folded
tarpaulin
was
laid
between
the
pine
and
the
fire
well
in
the
light
and
warmth
and
upon
it
the
men
set
steaming
pots
and
plates
and
cups
the
fragrance
from
which
was
strong
and
inviting
fetch
the
an
set
with
your
backs
to
the
fire
said
roy
later
when
the
girls
were
tucked
away
snugly
in
their
blankets
and
sheltered
from
the
rain
helen
remained
awake
after
bo
had
fallen
asleep
the
big
blaze
made
the
improvised
tent
as
bright
as
day
she
could
see
the
smoke
the
trunk
of
the
big
pine
towering
aloft
and
a
blank
space
of
sky
the
stream
hummed
a
song
seemingly
musical
at
times
and
then
discordant
and
dull
now
low
now
roaring
and
always
rushing
gurgling
babbling
flowing
chafing
in
its
hurry
presently
the
hunter
and
his
friend
returned
from
hobbling
the
horses
and
beside
the
fire
they
conversed
in
low
tones
wal
thet
trail
we
made
will
be
hid
i
reckon
said
roy
with
satisfaction
what
was
sheeped
over
would
be
washed
out
we
had
luck
an
now
i
ai

what
you

because
it
out
of
all
bounds
for
milt
those
words
sad
and
deep
ended
the
conversation
again
the
rumbling
rushing
stream
dominated
the
forest
an
owl
hooted
dismally
a
horse
trod
thuddingly
near
by
and
from
that
direction
came
a
cutting
tear
of
teeth
on
grass
a
voice
pierced
helen
deep
dreams
and
awaking
she
found
bo
shaking
and
calling
her
are
you
dead
came
the
gay
voice
almost
oh
my
back
broken
replied
helen
the
desire
to
move
seemed
clamped
in
a
vise
and
even
if
that
came
she
believed
the
effort
would
be
impossible
roy
called
us
said
bo
he
said
hurry
i
thought
i
die
just
sitting
up
and
i
give
you
a
million
dollars
to
lace
my
boots
wait
sister
till
you
try
to
pull
on
one
of
those
stiff
boots
with
heroic
and
violent
spirit
helen
sat
up
to
find
that
in
the
act
her
aches
and
pains
appeared
beyond
number
reaching
for
her
boots
she
found
them
cold
and
stiff
helen
unlaced
one
and
opening
it
wide
essayed
to
get
her
sore
foot
down
into
it
but
her
foot
appeared
swollen
and
the
boot
appeared
shrunken
she
could
not
get
it
half
on
though
she
expended
what
little
strength
seemed
left
in
her
aching
arms
she
groaned
bo
laughed
wickedly
her
hair
was
tousled
her
eyes
dancing
her
cheeks
red
be
game
she
said
stand
up
like
a
real
western
girl
and
pull
your
boot
whether
bo
scorn
or
advice
made
the
task
easier
did
not
occur
to
helen
but
the
fact
was
that
she
got
into
her
boots
walking
and
moving
a
little
appeared
to
loosen
the
stiff
joints
and
ease
that
tired
feeling
the
water
of
the
stream
where
the
girls
washed
was
colder
than
any
ice
helen
had
ever
felt
it
almost
paralyzed
her
hands
bo
mumbled
and
blew
like
a
porpoise
they
had
to
run
to
the
fire
before
being
able
to
comb
their
hair
the
air
was
wonderfully
keen
the
dawn
was
clear
bright
with
a
red
glow
in
the
east
where
the
sun
was
about
to
rise
all
ready
girls
called
roy
reckon
you
can
help
yourselves
milt
ai
comin
in
very
fast
with
the
hosses
i
rustle
off
to
help
him
we
got
a
hard
day
before
us
yesterday
was
nowhere
to
what
but
the
sun
going
to
shine
implored
bo
wal
you
bet
rejoined
roy
as
he
strode
off
helen
and
bo
ate
breakfast
and
had
the
camp
to
themselves
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
then
the
horses
came
thudding
down
with
dale
and
roy
riding
bareback
by
the
time
all
was
in
readiness
to
start
the
sun
was
up
melting
the
frost
and
ice
so
that
a
dazzling
bright
mist
full
of
rainbows
shone
under
the
trees
dale
looked
ranger
over
and
tried
the
cinches
of
bo
horse
what
your
choice
a
long
ride
behind
the
packs
with
me
or
a
short
cut
over
the
hills
with
roy
he
asked
i
choose
the
lesser
of
two
rides
replied
helen
smiling
reckon
that
be
easier
but
you
know
you
had
a
ride
said
dale
significantly
what
was
that
we
had
yesterday
asked
bo
archly
only
thirty
miles
but
cold
an
wet
will
be
fine
for
milt
i
take
a
blanket
an
some
grub
in
case
you
do
meet
us
said
roy
an
i
reckon
we
split
up
here
where
i
have
to
strike
out
on
thet
short
bo
mounted
without
a
helping
hand
but
helen
limbs
were
so
stiff
that
she
could
not
get
astride
the
high
ranger
without
assistance
the
hunter
headed
up
the
slope
of
the
canyon
which
on
that
side
was
not
steep
it
was
brown
pine
forest
with
here
and
there
a
clump
of
dark
evergreens
that
roy
called
spruce
by
the
time
this
slope
was
surmounted
helen
aches
were
not
so
bad
the
saddle
appeared
to
fit
her
better
and
the
gait
of
the
horse
was
not
so
unfamiliar
she
reflected
however
that
she
always
had
done
pretty
well
uphill
here
it
was
beautiful
uneven
and
wilder
they
rode
for
a
time
along
the
rim
with
the
white
rushing
stream
in
plain
sight
far
below
with
its
melodious
roar
ever
thrumming
in
the
ear
dale
reined
in
and
peered
down
at
the
fresh
deer
sign
all
along
here
he
said
pointing
wal
i
seen
thet
long
ago
rejoined
roy
helen
scrutiny
was
rewarded
by
descrying
several
tiny
depressions
in
the
dark
in
color
and
sharply
defined
we
may
never
get
a
better
chance
said
dale
those
deer
are
up
our
way
get
your
rifle
travel
was
resumed
then
with
roy
a
little
in
advance
of
the
presently
he
dismounted
threw
his
bridle
and
cautiously
peered
ahead
then
turning
he
waved
his
sombrero
the
halted
in
a
bunch
dale
beckoned
for
the
girls
to
follow
and
rode
up
to
roy
horse
this
point
helen
saw
was
at
the
top
of
an
intersecting
canuon
dale
dismounted
without
drawing
his
rifle
from
its
and
approached
roy
buck
an
two
does
he
said
an
they
winded
us
but
do
see
us
yet
girls
ride
up
following
the
directions
indicated
by
dale
long
arm
helen
looked
down
the
slope
it
was
open
with
tall
pines
here
and
there
and
clumps
of
silver
spruce
and
aspens
shining
like
gold
in
the
morning
sunlight
presently
bo
exclaimed
oh
look
i
see
i
see
then
helen
roving
glance
passed
something
different
from
green
and
gold
and
brown
shifting
back
to
it
she
saw
a
magnificent
stag
with
noble
spreading
antlers
standing
like
a
statue
his
head
up
in
alert
and
wild
posture
his
color
was
gray
beside
him
grazed
two
deer
of
slighter
and
more
graceful
build
without
horns
it
downhill
whispered
dale
an
you
goin
to
then
helen
saw
that
roy
had
his
rifle
leveled
oh

cried
dale
remark
evidently
nettled
roy
he
lowered
the
rifle

it

lookin
over
this
gun

there
an
tell
me

dead
bead
on
roy

allow
for
downhill
hurry
he
sees
us
roy
leveled
the
rifle
and
taking
aim
as
before
he
fired
the
buck
stood
perfectly
motionless
as
if
he
had
indeed
been
stone
the
does
however
jumped
with
a
start
and
gazed
in
fright
in
every
direction
told
you
i
seen
where
your
bullet
hit
thet
pine
half
a
foot
over
his
shoulder
try
again
an
aim
at
his
roy
now
took
a
quicker
aim
and
pulled
trigger
a
puff
of
dust
right
at
the
feet
of
the
buck
showed
where
roy
lead
had
struck
this
time
with
a
single
bound
wonderful
to
see
the
big
deer
was
out
of
sight
behind
trees
and
brush
the
does
leaped
after
him
doggone
the
luck
ejaculated
roy
red
in
the
face
as
he
worked
the
lever
of
his
rifle
never
could
shoot
downhill
nohow
his
rueful
apology
to
the
girls
for
missing
brought
a
merry
laugh
from
bo
not
for
worlds
would
i
have
had
you
kill
that
beautiful
deer
she
exclaimed
we
wo
have
venison
steak
off
him
that
certain
remarked
dale
dryly
an
maybe
none
off
any
deer
if
roy
does
the
they
resumed
travel
sheering
off
to
the
right
and
keeping
to
the
edge
of
the
intersecting
canuon
at
length
they
rode
down
to
the
bottom
where
a
tiny
brook
babbled
through
willows
and
they
followed
this
for
a
mile
or
so
down
to
where
it
flowed
into
the
larger
stream
a
dim
trail
overgrown
with
grass
showed
at
this
point
here
where
we
part
said
dale
you
beat
me
into
my
camp
but
i
get
there
sometime
after
hey

replied
dale
ai
he
corralled
or
tied
up
no
he
has
the
run
of
the
wal
then
an
rustle
dale
nodded
to
the
girls
and
turning
his
horse
he
drove
the
before
him
up
the
open
space
between
the
stream
and
the
wooded
slope
roy
stepped
off
his
horse
with
that
single
action
which
appeared
such
a
feat
to
helen
guess
i
better
cinch
up
he
said
as
he
threw
a
stirrup
up
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
you
girls

goin
to
see
wild
who
old

what
it

overrun
with
birds

an
vermin
of
all
kinds
as
tame
as
tame

but
i
ca
figger
thet
you

senaca
of

a
senaca
asked
helen
as
she
shifted
her
foot
to
let
him
tighten
the
cinches
on
her
saddle
thet
mexican
for
park
i
guess
he
replied
these
mountains

of
parks
an
say
i
do

no
prettier
place
till
i
get
to
heaven
there
ranger
old
boy
thet
he
slapped
the
horse
affectionately
and
turning
to
his
own
he
stepped
and
swung
his
long
length
up
it
ai
deep
crossin
here
come
on
he
called
and
spurred
his
bay
the
stream
here
was
wide
and
it
looked
deep
but
turned
out
to
be
deceptive
wal
girls
here
beginneth
the
second
lesson
he
drawled
cheerily
ride
one
behind
the
other
stick
close
to
me
do
what
i
do
an
holler
when
you
want
to
rest
or
if
somethin
goes
with
that
he
spurred
into
the
thicket
bo
went
next
and
helen
followed
the
willows
dragged
at
her
so
hard
that
she
was
unable
to
watch
roy
and
the
result
was
that
a
branch
of
a
tree
knocked
her
hard
on
the
head
it
hurt
and
startled
her
and
roused
her
mettle
roy
was
keeping
to
the
easy
trot
that
covered
ground
so
well
and
he
led
up
a
slope
to
the
open
pine
forest
here
the
ride
for
several
miles
was
straight
level
and
open
helen
liked
the
forest
it
was
brown
and
green
with
patches
of
gold
where
the
sun
struck
she
saw
her
first
bird
big
blue
grouse
that
whirred
up
from
under
her
horse
and
little
checkered
gray
quail
that
appeared
awkward
on
the
wing
several
times
roy
pointed
out
deer
flashing
gray
across
some
forest
aisle
and
often
when
he
pointed
helen
was
not
quick
enough
to
see
helen
realized
that
this
ride
would
make
up
for
the
hideous
one
of
yesterday
so
far
she
had
been
only
barely
conscious
of
sore
places
and
aching
bones
these
she
would
bear
with
she
loved
the
wild
and
the
beautiful
both
of
which
increased
manifestly
with
every
mile
the
sun
was
warm
the
air
fragrant
and
cool
the
sky
blue
as
azure
and
so
deep
that
she
imagined
that
she
could
look
far
up
into
it
suddenly
roy
reined
in
so
sharply
that
he
pulled
the
bay
up
short
look
he
called
sharply
bo
screamed
not
thet
way
here
aw
he
gone
nell
it
was
a
bear
i
saw
it
oh
not
like
circus
bears
at
all
cried
bo
helen
had
missed
her
opportunity
reckon
he
was
a
grizzly
an
i
jest
as
well
pleased
thet
he
loped
off
said
roy
altering
his
course
somewhat
he
led
to
an
old
rotten
log
that
the
bear
had
been
digging
in
after
grubs
there
see
his
track
he
was
a
whopper
shore
they
rode
on
out
to
a
high
point
that
overlooked
canuon
and
range
gorge
and
ridge
green
and
black
as
far
as
helen
could
see
the
ranges
were
bold
and
long
climbing
to
the
central
uplift
where
a
number
of
fringed
peaks
raised
their
heads
to
the
vast
bare
dome
of
old
baldy
far
as
vision
could
see
to
the
right
lay
one
rolling
forest
of
pine
beautiful
and
serene
somewhere
down
beyond
must
have
lain
the
desert
but
it
was
not
in
sight
i
see
turkeys
down
there
said
roy
backing
away
we
go
down
and
around
an
mebbe
i
get
a
descent
beyond
a
rocky
point
was
made
through
thick
brush
this
slope
consisted
of
wide
benches
covered
with
copses
and
scattered
pines
and
many
oaks
helen
was
delighted
to
see
the
familiar
trees
although
these
were
different
from
missouri
oaks
rugged
and
gnarled
but
not
tall
these
trees
spread
wide
branches
the
leaves
of
which
were
yellowing
roy
led
into
a
grassy
glade
and
leaping
off
his
horse
rifle
in
hand
he
prepared
to
shoot
at
something
again
bo
cried
out
but
this
time
it
was
in
delight
then
helen
saw
an
immense
flock
of
turkeys
apparently
like
the
turkeys
she
knew
at
home
but
these
had
bronze
and
checks
of
white
and
they
looked
wild
there
must
have
been
a
hundred
in
the
flock
most
of
them
hens
a
few
gobblers
on
the
far
side
began
the
flight
running
swiftly
off
helen
plainly
heard
the
thud
of
their
feet
roy
shot
once
twice
three
times
then
rose
a
great
commotion
and
thumping
and
a
loud
roar
of
many
wings
dust
and
leaves
whirling
in
the
air
were
left
where
the
turkeys
had
been
wal
i
got
two
said
roy
and
he
strode
forward
to
pick
up
his
game
returning
he
tied
two
shiny
plump
gobblers
back
of
his
saddle
and
remounted
his
horse
we
have
turkey
if
milt
gets
to
camp
in
the
ride
was
resumed
helen
never
would
have
tired
riding
through
those
oak
groves
brown
and
sear
and
yellow
with
leaves
and
acorns
falling
bears
have
been
workin
in
here
already
said
roy
i
see
tracks
all
over
they
eat
acorns
in
the
fall
an
mebbe
we
run
into
one
the
farther
down
he
led
the
wilder
and
thicker
grew
the
trees
so
that
dodging
branches
was
no
light
task
ranger
did
not
seem
to
care
how
close
he
passed
a
tree
or
under
a
limb
so
that
he
missed
them
himself
but
helen
thereby
got
some
additional
bruises
particularly
hard
was
it
when
passing
a
tree
to
get
her
knee
out
of
the
way
in
time
roy
halted
next
at
what
appeared
a
large
green
pond
full
of
vegetation
and
in
places
covered
with
a
thick
scum
but
it
had
a
current
and
an
outlet
proving
it
to
be
a
huge
spring
roy
pointed
down
at
a
muddy
place
he
heard
us
comin
look
at
thet
little
track
cub
track
an
look
at
these
scratches
on
this
tree
higher
my
head
an
old
stood
up
an
scratched
roy
sat
his
saddle
and
reached
up
to
touch
fresh
marks
on
the
tree
woods
full
of
big
bears
he
said
grinning
an
i
take
it
particular
kind
of
this
old
she
rustlin
off
with
her
cub
with
cubs
are
the
next
place
to
stir
helen
to
enthusiasm
was
the
glen
at
the
bottom
of
this
canuon
maples
aspens
overtopped
by
lofty
pines
made
dense
shade
over
a
brook
where
trout
splashed
on
the
brown
swirling
current
and
leaves
drifted
down
and
stray
flecks
of
golden
sunlight
lightened
the
gloom
here
was
hard
riding
to
and
fro
across
the
brook
between
huge
mossy
boulders
and
between
aspens
so
close
together
that
helen
could
scarce
squeeze
her
knees
through
once
more
roy
climbed
out
of
that
canuon
over
a
ridge
into
another
down
long
wooded
slopes
and
through
thickets
on
and
on
till
the
sun
stood
straight
overhead
then
he
halted
for
a
short
rest
unsaddled
the
horses
to
let
them
roll
and
gave
the
girls
some
cold
lunch
that
he
had
packed
he
strolled
off
with
his
gun
and
upon
returning
resaddled
and
gave
the
word
to
start
that
was
the
last
of
rest
and
easy
traveling
for
the
girls
the
forest
that
he
struck
into
seemed
ribbed
like
a
washboard
with
deep
ravines
so
steep
of
slope
as
to
make
precarious
travel
mostly
he
kept
to
the
bottom
where
dry
washes
afforded
a
kind
of
trail
but
it
was
necessary
to
cross
these
ravines
when
they
were
too
long
to
be
headed
and
this
crossing
was
work
the
locust
thickets
characteristic
of
these
slopes
were
thorny
and
close
knit
they
tore
and
scratched
and
stung
both
horses
and
riders
ranger
appeared
to
be
the
most
intelligent
of
the
horses
and
suffered
less
bo
white
mustang
dragged
her
through
more
than
one
brambly
place
on
the
other
hand
some
of
these
steep
slopes
were
comparatively
free
of
underbrush
great
firs
and
pines
loomed
up
on
all
sides
the
earth
was
soft
and
the
hoofs
sank
deep
toward
the
bottom
of
a
descent
ranger
would
brace
his
front
feet
and
then
slide
down
on
his
haunches
this
mode
facilitated
travel
but
it
frightened
helen
the
climb
out
then
on
the
other
side
had
to
be
done
on
foot
after
half
a
dozen
slopes
surmounted
in
this
way
helen
strength
was
spent
and
her
breath
was
gone
she
felt
she
could
not
get
enough
air
her
feet
felt
like
lead
and
her
was
a
burden
a
hundred
times
hot
and
wet
and
throbbing
she
was
compelled
to
stop
always
she
had
been
a
splendid
walker
and
climber
and
here
to
break
up
the
long
ride
she
was
glad
to
be
on
her
feet
but
she
could
only
drag
one
foot
up
after
the
other
then
when
her
nose
began
to
bleed
she
realized
that
it
was
the
elevation
which
was
causing
all
the
trouble
her
heart
however
did
not
hurt
her
though
she
was
conscious
of
an
oppression
on
her
breast
at
last
roy
led
into
a
ravine
so
deep
and
wide
and
full
of
forest
verdure
that
it
appeared
impossible
to
cross
nevertheless
he
started
down
dismounting
after
a
little
way
helen
found
that
leading
ranger
down
was
worse
than
riding
him
he
came
fast
and
he
would
step
right
in
her
tracks
she
was
not
quick
enough
to
get
away
from
him
twice
he
stepped
on
her
foot
and
again
his
broad
chest
hit
her
shoulder
and
threw
her
flat
when
he
began
to
slide
near
the
bottom
helen
had
to
run
for
her
life
oh
nell
is
this
great
panted
bo
from
somewhere
ahead
bo
your
mind
gone
panted
helen
in
reply
roy
tried
several
places
to
climb
out
and
failed
in
each
leading
down
the
ravine
for
a
hundred
yards
or
more
he
essayed
another
attempt
here
there
had
been
a
slide
and
in
part
the
earth
was
bare
when
he
had
worked
up
this
he
halted
above
and
called
bad
place
keep
on
the
up
side
of
the
hosses
this
appeared
easier
said
than
done
helen
could
not
watch
bo
because
ranger
would
not
wait
he
pulled
at
the
bridle
and
snorted
faster
you
come
the
better
called
roy
helen
could
not
see
the
sense
of
that
but
she
tried
roy
and
bo
had
dug
a
deep
trail
zigzag
up
that
treacherous
slide
helen
made
the
mistake
of
starting
to
follow
in
their
tracks
and
when
she
realized
this
ranger
was
climbing
fast
almost
dragging
her
and
it
was
too
late
to
get
above
helen
began
to
labor
she
slid
down
right
in
front
of
ranger
the
intelligent
animal
with
a
snort
plunged
out
of
the
trail
to
keep
from
stepping
on
her
then
he
was
above
her
lookout
down
there
yelled
roy
in
warning
get
on
the
up
side
but
that
did
not
appear
possible
the
earth
began
to
slide
under
ranger
and
that
impeded
helen
progress
he
got
in
advance
of
her
straining
on
the
bridle
let
go
yelled
roy
helen
dropped
the
bridle
just
as
a
heavy
slide
began
to
move
with
ranger
he
snorted
fiercely
and
rearing
high
in
a
mighty
plunge
he
gained
solid
ground
helen
was
buried
to
her
knees
but
extricating
herself
she
crawled
to
a
safe
point
and
rested
before
climbing
farther
bad
thet
was
roy
comment
when
at
last
she
joined
him
and
bo
at
the
top
roy
appeared
at
a
loss
as
to
which
way
to
go
he
rode
to
high
ground
and
looked
in
all
directions
to
helen
one
way
appeared
as
wild
and
rough
as
another
and
all
was
yellow
green
and
black
under
the
westering
sun
roy
rode
a
short
distance
in
one
direction
then
changed
for
another
presently
he
stopped
wal
i
shore
turned
round
he
said
you
not
lost
cried
bo
reckon
i
been
thet
for
a
couple
of
hours
he
replied
cheerfully
never
did
ride
across
here
i
had
the
direction
but
i
blamed
now
if
i
can
tell
which
way
thet
helen
gazed
at
him
in
consternation
lost
she
echoed
chapter
ix
a
silence
ensued
fraught
with
poignant
fear
for
helen
as
she
gazed
into
bo
whitening
face
she
read
her
sister
mind
bo
was
remembering
tales
of
lost
people
who
never
were
found
me
an
milt
get
lost
every
day
said
roy
you
do
suppose
any
man
can
know
all
this
big
country
it
nothin
for
us
to
be
oh
i
was
lost
when
i
was
little
said
bo
wal
i
reckon
it
been
better
not
to
tell
you
so
offhand
like
replied
roy
contritely
do
feel
bad
now
all
i
need
is
a
peek
at
old
baldy
then
i
have
my
bearin
come
helen
confidence
returned
as
roy
led
off
at
a
fast
trot
he
rode
toward
the
westering
sun
keeping
to
the
ridge
they
had
ascended
until
once
more
he
came
out
upon
a
promontory
old
baldy
loomed
there
blacker
and
higher
and
closer
the
dark
forest
showed
round
yellow
bare
spots
like
parks
not
so
far
off
the
track
said
roy
as
he
wheeled
his
horse
make
camp
in
milt
senaca
he
led
down
off
the
ridge
into
a
valley
and
then
up
to
higher
altitude
where
the
character
of
the
forest
changed
the
trees
were
no
longer
pines
but
firs
and
spruce
growing
thin
and
exceedingly
tall
with
few
branches
below
the
topmost
foliage
so
dense
was
this
forest
that
twilight
seemed
to
have
come
travel
was
arduous
everywhere
were
windfalls
that
had
to
be
avoided
and
not
a
rod
was
there
without
a
fallen
tree
the
horses
laboring
slowly
sometimes
sank
into
the
brown
duff
gray
moss
festooned
the
and
an
moss
grew
thick
on
the
rotting
logs
helen
loved
this
forest
primeval
it
was
so
still
so
dark
so
gloomy
so
full
of
shadows
and
shade
and
a
dank
smell
of
rotting
wood
and
sweet
fragrance
of
spruce
the
great
windfalls
where
trees
were
jammed
together
in
dozens
showed
the
savagery
of
the
storms
wherever
a
single
monarch
lay
uprooted
there
had
sprung
up
a
number
of
ambitious
sons
jealous
of
one
another
fighting
for
place
even
the
trees
fought
one
another
the
forest
was
a
place
of
mystery
but
its
strife
could
be
read
by
any
eye
the
lightnings
had
split
firs
clear
to
the
roots
and
others
it
had
circled
with
ripping
tear
from
top
to
trunk
time
came
however
when
the
exceeding
wildness
of
the
forest
in
density
and
fallen
timber
made
it
imperative
for
helen
to
put
all
her
attention
on
the
ground
and
trees
in
her
immediate
vicinity
so
the
pleasure
of
gazing
ahead
at
the
beautiful
wilderness
was
denied
her
thereafter
travel
became
toil
and
the
hours
endless
roy
led
on
and
ranger
followed
while
the
shadows
darkened
under
the
trees
she
was
reeling
in
her
saddle
half
blind
and
sick
when
roy
called
out
cheerily
that
they
were
almost
there
whatever
his
idea
was
to
helen
it
seemed
many
miles
that
she
followed
him
farther
out
of
the
forest
down
upon
slopes
of
low
spruce
like
evergreen
which
descended
sharply
to
another
level
where
dark
shallow
streams
flowed
gently
and
the
solemn
stillness
held
a
low
murmur
of
falling
water
and
at
last
the
wood
ended
upon
a
wonderful
park
full
of
a
thick
rich
golden
light
of
sunset
smell
the
smoke
said
roy
by
solomon
if
milt
ai
here
ahead
of
me
he
rode
on
helen
weary
gaze
took
in
the
round
senaca
the
circling
black
slopes
leading
up
to
craggy
rims
all
gold
and
red
in
the
last
flare
of
the
sun
then
all
the
spirit
left
in
her
flashed
up
in
thrilling
wonder
at
this
exquisite
wild
and
colorful
spot
horses
were
grazing
out
in
the
long
grass
and
there
were
deer
grazing
with
them
roy
led
round
a
corner
of
the
fringed
bordering
woodland
and
there
under
lofty
trees
shone
a
huge
gray
rocks
loomed
beyond
and
then
cliffs
rose
step
by
step
to
a
notch
in
the
mountain
wall
over
which
poured
a
thin
lacy
waterfall
as
helen
gazed
in
rapture
the
sunset
gold
faded
to
white
and
all
the
western
slope
of
the
amphitheater
darkened
dale
tall
form
appeared
reckon
you
late
he
said
as
with
a
comprehensive
flash
of
eye
he
took
in
the
three
milt
i
got
lost
replied
roy
i
feared
as
much
you
girls
look
like
you
done
better
to
ride
with
me
went
on
dale
as
he
offered
a
hand
to
help
bo
off
she
took
it
tried
to
get
her
foot
out
of
the
stirrups
and
then
she
slid
from
the
saddle
into
dale
arms
he
placed
her
on
her
feet
and
supporting
her
said
solicitously
a
ride
in
three
days
for
a
tenderfoot
is
somethin
your
uncle
al
wo
believe
come
walk
if
it
kills
you
whereupon
he
led
bo
very
much
as
if
he
were
teaching
a
child
to
walk
the
fact
that
the
voluble
bo
had
nothing
to
say
was
significant
to
helen
who
was
following
with
the
assistance
of
roy
one
of
the
huge
rocks
resembled
a
in
that
it
contained
a
hollow
over
which
the
shelf
flared
out
it
reached
toward
branches
of
great
pines
a
spring
burst
from
a
crack
in
the
solid
rock
the
campfire
blazed
under
a
pine
and
the
blue
column
of
smoke
rose
just
in
front
of
the
shelving
rock
packs
were
lying
on
the
grass
and
some
of
them
were
open
there
were
no
signs
here
of
a
permanent
habitation
of
the
hunter
but
farther
on
were
other
huge
rocks
leaning
cracked
and
forming
caverns
some
of
which
perhaps
he
utilized
my
camp
is
just
back
said
dale
as
if
he
had
read
helen
mind
we
fix
up
round
here
for
you
helen
and
bo
were
made
as
easy
as
blankets
and
saddles
could
make
them
and
the
men
went
about
their
tasks
nell
is
this
a
dream
murmured
bo
no
child
it
real
terribly
real
replied
helen
now
that
here
with
that
awful
ride
over
we
can
it
so
pretty
here
yawned
bo
i
just
as
lief
uncle
al
find
us
very
bo
he
a
sick
man
think
what
the
worry
will
be
to
i
bet
if
he
knows
dale
he
wo
be
so
dale
told
us
uncle
al
disliked
pooh
what
difference
does
that
make
oh
i
do
know
which
i
am
hungrier
or
tireder
i
could
eat
said
helen
wearily
when
she
stretched
out
she
had
a
vague
delicious
sensation
that
that
was
the
end
of
helen
rayner
and
she
was
glad
above
her
through
the
lacy
fernlike
she
saw
blue
sky
and
a
pale
star
just
showing
twilight
was
stealing
down
swiftly
the
silence
was
beautiful
seemingly
undisturbed
by
the
soft
silky
dreamy
fall
of
water
helen
closed
her
eyes
ready
for
sleep
with
the
physical
commotion
within
her
body
gradually
yielding
in
some
places
her
bones
felt
as
if
they
had
come
out
through
her
flesh
in
others
throbbed
aches
her
muscles
appeared
slowly
to
subside
to
relax
with
the
quivering
twinges
ceasing
one
by
one
through
muscle
and
bone
through
all
her
body
pulsed
a
burning
current
bo
head
dropped
on
helen
shoulder
sense
became
vague
to
helen
she
lost
the
low
murmur
of
the
waterfall
and
then
the
sound
or
feeling
of
some
one
at
the
campfire
and
her
last
conscious
thought
was
that
she
tried
to
open
her
eyes
and
could
not
when
she
awoke
all
was
bright
the
sun
shone
almost
directly
overhead
helen
was
astounded
bo
lay
wrapped
in
deep
sleep
her
face
flushed
with
beads
of
perspiration
on
her
brow
and
the
chestnut
curls
damp
helen
threw
down
the
blankets
and
then
gathering
courage
for
she
felt
as
if
her
back
was
broken
she
endeavored
to
sit
up
in
vain
her
spirit
was
willing
but
her
muscles
refused
to
act
it
must
take
a
violent
spasmodic
effort
she
tried
it
with
shut
eyes
and
succeeding
sat
there
trembling
the
commotion
she
had
made
in
the
blankets
awoke
bo
and
she
blinked
her
surprised
blue
eyes
in
the
sunlight
hello
nell
do
i
have
to
get
up
she
asked
sleepily
can
you
queried
helen
can
i
what
bo
was
now
thoroughly
awake
and
lay
there
staring
at
her
sister
why
get
i
like
to
know
why
not
retorted
bo
as
she
made
the
effort
she
got
one
arm
and
shoulder
up
only
to
flop
back
like
a
crippled
thing
and
she
uttered
the
most
piteous
little
moan
i
dead
i
know
i
am
well
if
you
going
to
be
a
western
girl
you
better
have
spunk
enough
to
ejaculated
bo
then
she
rolled
over
not
without
groans
and
once
upon
her
face
she
raised
herself
on
her
hands
and
turned
to
a
sitting
posture
where
everybody
oh
nell
it
perfectly
lovely
here
paradise
helen
looked
around
a
fire
was
smoldering
no
one
was
in
sight
wonderful
distant
colors
seemed
to
strike
her
glance
as
she
tried
to
fix
it
upon
objects
a
beautiful
little
green
tent
or
shack
had
been
erected
out
of
spruce
boughs
it
had
a
slanting
roof
that
sloped
all
the
way
from
a
to
the
ground
half
of
the
opening
in
front
was
closed
as
were
the
sides
the
spruce
boughs
appeared
all
to
be
laid
in
the
same
direction
giving
it
a
smooth
compact
appearance
actually
as
if
it
had
grown
there
that
was
there
last
night
inquired
bo
i
did
see
it
where
you
get
that
name
it
western
my
dear
i
bet
they
put
it
up
for
us
sure
i
see
our
bags
inside
let
get
up
it
must
be
the
girls
had
considerable
fun
as
well
as
pain
in
getting
up
and
keeping
each
other
erect
until
their
limbs
would
hold
them
firmly
they
were
delighted
with
the
spruce
it
faced
the
open
and
stood
just
under
the
shelf
of
rock
the
tiny
outlet
from
the
spring
flowed
beside
it
and
spilled
its
clear
water
over
a
stone
to
fall
into
a
little
pool
the
floor
of
this
woodland
habitation
consisted
of
tips
of
spruce
boughs
to
about
a
foot
in
depth
all
laid
one
way
smooth
and
springy
and
so
sweetly
odorous
that
the
air
seemed
intoxicating
helen
and
bo
opened
their
baggage
and
what
with
use
of
the
cold
water
brush
and
comb
and
clean
blouses
they
made
themselves
feel
as
comfortable
as
possible
considering
the
excruciating
aches
then
they
went
out
to
the
campfire
helen
eye
was
attracted
by
moving
objects
near
at
hand
then
simultaneously
with
bo
cry
of
delight
helen
saw
a
beautiful
doe
approaching
under
the
trees
dale
walked
beside
it
you
sure
had
a
long
sleep
was
the
hunter
greeting
i
reckon
you
both
look
good
morning
or
is
it
afternoon
we
just
able
to
move
about
said
helen
i
could
ride
declared
bo
stoutly
oh
nell
look
at
the
deer
coming
to
the
doe
had
hung
back
a
little
as
dale
reached
the
it
was
a
gray
slender
creature
smooth
as
silk
with
great
dark
eyes
it
stood
a
moment
long
ears
erect
and
then
with
a
graceful
little
trot
came
up
to
bo
and
reached
a
slim
nose
for
her
outstretched
hand
all
about
it
except
the
beautiful
soft
eyes
seemed
wild
and
yet
it
was
as
tame
as
a
kitten
then
suddenly
as
bo
fondled
the
long
ears
it
gave
a
start
and
breaking
away
ran
back
out
of
sight
under
the
pines
what
frightened
it
asked
bo
dale
pointed
up
at
the
wall
under
the
shelving
roof
of
rock
there
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
curled
up
on
a
ledge
lay
a
huge
tawny
animal
with
a
face
like
that
of
a
cat
she
afraid
of
tom
replied
dale
recognizes
him
as
a
hereditary
foe
i
guess
i
ca
make
friends
of
oh
so
that
tom
the
pet
lion
exclaimed
bo
ugh
no
wonder
that
deer
ran
off
how
long
has
he
been
up
there
queried
helen
gazing
fascinated
at
dale
famous
pet
i
could
say
tom
comes
an
goes
replied
dale
but
i
sent
him
up
there
last
and
he
was
there
perfectly
free
right
over
us
while
we
slept
burst
out
bo
yes
an
i
reckon
you
slept
the
safer
for
of
all
things
nell
is
he
a
monster
but
he
does
look
like
a
lion
an
african
lion
he
a
panther
i
saw
his
like
at
the
circus
he
a
cougar
said
dale
the
panther
is
long
and
slim
tom
is
not
only
long
but
thick
an
round
i
had
him
four
years
an
he
was
a
kitten
no
bigger
my
fist
when
i
got
is
he
perfectly
tame
safe
asked
helen
anxiously
i
never
told
anybody
that
tom
was
safe
but
he
is
replied
dale
you
can
absolutely
believe
it
a
wild
cougar
would
attack
a
man
unless
cornered
or
starved
an
tom
is
like
a
big
the
beast
raised
his
great
catlike
face
with
its
sleepy
eyes
and
looked
down
upon
them
shall
i
call
him
down
inquired
dale
for
once
bo
did
not
find
her
voice
let
us
get
a
little
more
used
to
him
at
a
distance
replied
helen
with
a
little
laugh
if
he
comes
to
you
just
rub
his
head
an
you
see
how
tame
he
is
said
dale
reckon
you
both
hungry
not
so
very
returned
helen
aware
of
his
penetrating
gray
gaze
upon
her
well
i
am
vouchsafed
bo
soon
as
the
turkey
done
we
eat
my
camp
is
round
between
the
rocks
i
call
not
until
his
broad
back
was
turned
did
helen
notice
that
the
hunter
looked
different
then
she
saw
he
wore
a
lighter
cleaner
suit
of
buckskin
with
no
coat
and
instead
of
the
horseman
boots
he
wore
moccasins
and
leggings
the
change
made
him
appear
more
lithe
nell
i
do
know
what
you
think
but
call
him
handsome
declared
bo
helen
had
no
idea
what
she
thought
let
try
to
walk
some
she
suggested
so
they
essayed
that
painful
task
and
got
as
far
as
a
pine
log
some
few
rods
from
their
camp
this
point
was
close
to
the
edge
of
the
park
from
which
there
was
an
unobstructed
view
my
what
a
place
exclaimed
bo
with
eyes
wide
and
round
oh
beautiful
breathed
helen
an
unexpected
blaze
of
color
drew
her
gaze
first
out
of
the
black
spruce
slopes
shone
patches
of
aspens
gloriously
red
and
gold
and
low
down
along
the
edge
of
timber
troops
of
aspens
ran
out
into
the
park
not
yet
so
blazing
as
those
above
but
purple
and
yellow
and
white
in
the
sunshine
masses
of
silver
spruce
like
trees
in
moonlight
bordered
the
park
sending
out
here
and
there
an
isolated
tree
sharp
as
a
spear
with
close
to
the
ground
long
grass
resembling
wheat
covered
the
entire
floor
of
the
park
gently
waving
to
the
wind
above
sheered
the
black
slopes
steep
and
unscalable
rising
to
buttresses
of
dark
rock
and
to
the
east
circled
the
rows
of
gray
and
old
and
fringed
splitting
at
the
top
in
the
notch
where
the
lacy
slumberous
waterfall
like
white
smoke
fell
and
vanished
to
reappear
in
wider
sheet
of
lace
only
to
fall
and
vanish
again
in
the
green
depths
it
was
a
verdant
valley
in
the
mountain
walls
wild
and
sad
and
lonesome
the
waterfall
dominated
the
spirit
of
the
place
dreamy
and
sleepy
and
tranquil
it
murmured
sweetly
on
one
breath
of
wind
and
lulled
with
another
and
sometimes
died
out
altogether
only
to
come
again
in
soft
strange
roar
paradise
park
whispered
bo
to
herself
a
call
from
dale
disturbed
their
raptures
turning
they
hobbled
with
eager
but
painful
steps
in
the
direction
of
a
larger
situated
to
the
right
of
the
great
rock
that
sheltered
their
no
hut
or
house
showed
there
and
none
was
needed
and
homes
for
a
hundred
hunters
were
there
in
the
sections
of
caverned
cliffs
split
off
in
bygone
ages
from
the
mountain
wall
above
a
few
stately
pines
stood
out
from
the
rocks
and
a
clump
of
silver
spruce
ran
down
to
a
brown
brook
this
camp
was
only
a
step
from
the
round
the
corner
of
a
huge
rock
yet
it
had
been
out
of
sight
here
indeed
was
evidence
of
a
hunter
home
pelts
and
skins
and
antlers
a
neat
pile
of
split
a
long
ledge
of
rock
well
sheltered
and
loaded
with
bags
like
a
huge
packs
and
ropes
and
saddles
tools
and
weapons
and
a
platform
of
dry
brush
as
shelter
for
a
fire
around
which
hung
on
poles
a
various
assortment
of
utensils
for
camp
hyar
you
git
shouted
dale
and
he
threw
a
stick
at
something
a
bear
cub
scampered
away
in
haste
he
was
small
and
woolly
and
brown
and
he
grunted
as
he
ran
soon
he
halted
that
bud
said
dale
as
the
girls
came
up
guess
he
near
starved
in
my
absence
an
now
he
wants
everythin
especially
the
sugar

he
dear
oh
i
love

cried
bo
come
back
bud
come
the
cub
however
kept
his
distance
watching
dale
with
bright
little
eyes
where
roy
asked
helen
roy
gone
he
was
sorry
not
to
say
but
it
important
he

down
in
the
pines
on
anson
trail
he
hang
to
anson
an
in
case

he

in
to
see
where
your
uncle

helen
gravely

replied
al

reckon

the
mountains
by
this
time
if

i
would
count
on
your
uncle
very
soon
i
sorry
i
done
my
best
it
sure
is
a
bad
do
think
me
ungracious
replied
helen
hastily
how
plainly
he
had
intimated
that
it
must
be
privation
and
annoyance
for
her
to
be
compelled
to
accept
his
hospitality
you
are
good
kind
i
owe
you
much
i
be
eternally
dale
straightened
as
he
looked
at
her
his
glance
was
intent
piercing
he
seemed
to
be
receiving
a
strange
or
unusual
portent
no
need
for
him
to
say
he
had
never
before
been
spoken
to
like
that
you
may
have
to
stay
here
with
me
for
weeks
maybe
months
if
the
bad
luck
to
get
snowed
in
he
said
slowly
as
if
startled
at
this
deduction
you
safe
here
no
could
ever
find
this
camp
i
take
risks
to
get
you
safe
into
al
hands
but
i
goin
to
be
pretty
sure
about
what
i
doin
so
there
plenty
to
eat
an
a
pretty
pretty
why
it
grand
exclaimed
bo
i
called
it
paradise
paradise
park
he
repeated
weighing
the
words
you
named
it
also
the
creek
paradise
creek
i
been
here
twelve
years
with
no
fit
name
for
my
home
till
you
said
oh
that
pleases
me
returned
bo
with
shining
eyes
eat
now
said
dale
an
i
reckon
you
like
that
there
was
a
clean
tarpaulin
upon
which
were
spread
steaming
fragrant
pans
roast
turkey
hot
biscuits
and
gravy
mashed
potatoes
as
white
as
if
prepared
at
home
stewed
dried
apples
and
butter
and
coffee
this
bounteous
repast
surprised
and
delighted
the
girls
when
they
had
once
tasted
the
roast
wild
turkey
then
milt
dale
had
occasion
to
blush
at
their
encomiums
i
hope
uncle
al
does
come
for
a
month
declared
bo
as
she
tried
to
get
her
breath
there
was
a
brown
spot
on
her
nose
and
one
on
each
cheek
suspiciously
close
to
her
mouth
dale
laughed
it
was
pleasant
to
hear
him
for
his
laugh
seemed
unused
and
deep
as
if
it
came
from
tranquil
depths
wo
you
eat
with
us
asked
helen
reckon
i
will
he
said
it
save
time
an
hot
grub
tastes
quite
an
interval
of
silence
ensued
which
presently
was
broken
by
dale
here
comes
helen
observed
with
a
thrill
that
the
cougar
was
magnificent
seen
erect
on
approaching
with
slow
sinuous
grace
his
color
was
tawny
with
spots
of
whitish
gray
he
had
big
and
round
and
furry
and
a
huge
head
with
great
tawny
eyes
no
matter
how
tame
he
was
said
to
be
he
looked
wild
like
a
dog
he
walked
right
up
and
it
so
happened
that
he
was
directly
behind
bo
within
reach
of
her
when
she
turned
oh
lord
cried
bo
and
up
went
both
of
her
hands
in
one
of
which
was
a
huge
piece
of
turkey
tom
took
it
not
viciously
but
nevertheless
with
a
snap
that
made
helen
jump
as
if
by
magic
the
turkey
vanished
and
tom
took
a
closer
step
toward
bo
her
expression
of
fright
changed
to
consternation
he
stole
my
turkey
tom
come
here
ordered
dale
sharply
the
cougar
glided
round
rather
sheepishly
now
lie
down
an
tom
crouched
on
his
head
resting
on
his
paws
with
his
beautiful
tawny
eyes
light
and
piercing
fixed
upon
the
hunter
do
grab
said
dale
holding
out
a
piece
of
turkey
whereupon
tom
took
it
less
voraciously
as
it
happened
the
little
bear
cub
saw
this
transaction
and
he
plainly
indicated
his
opinion
of
the
preference
shown
to
tom
oh
the
dear
exclaimed
bo
he
means
it
not
fair
come
bud
come
but
bud
would
not
approach
the
group
until
called
by
dale
then
he
scrambled
to
them
with
every
manifestation
of
delight
bo
almost
forgot
her
own
needs
in
feeding
him
and
getting
acquainted
with
him
tom
plainly
showed
his
jealousy
of
bud
and
bud
likewise
showed
his
fear
of
the
great
cat
helen
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
her
eyes
that
she
was
in
the
woods
calmly
and
hungrily
partaking
of
sweet
meat
that
a
mountain
lion
lay
on
one
side
of
her
and
a
baby
brown
bear
sat
on
the
other
that
a
strange
hunter
a
man
of
the
forest
there
in
his
lonely
and
isolated
fastness
appealed
to
the
romance
in
her
and
interested
her
as
no
one
else
she
had
ever
met
when
the
wonderful
meal
was
at
last
finished
bo
enticed
the
bear
cub
around
to
the
camp
of
the
girls
and
there
soon
became
great
comrades
with
him
helen
watching
bo
play
was
inclined
to
envy
her
no
matter
where
bo
was
placed
she
always
got
something
out
of
it
she
adapted
herself
she
who
could
have
a
good
time
with
almost
any
one
or
anything
would
find
the
hours
sweet
and
fleeting
in
this
beautiful
park
of
wild
wonders
but
merely
objective
actions
merely
physical
movements
had
never
yet
contented
helen
she
could
run
and
climb
and
ride
and
play
with
hearty
and
healthy
abandon
but
those
things
would
not
suffice
long
for
her
and
her
mind
needed
food
helen
was
a
thinker
one
reason
she
had
desired
to
make
her
home
in
the
west
was
that
by
taking
up
a
life
of
the
open
of
action
she
might
think
and
dream
and
brood
less
and
here
she
was
in
the
wild
west
after
the
three
most
strenuously
active
days
of
her
career
and
still
the
same
old
giant
revolved
her
mind
and
turned
it
upon
herself
and
upon
all
she
saw
what
can
i
do
she
asked
bo
almost
helplessly
why
rest
you
silly
retorted
bo
you
walk
like
an
old
crippled
woman
with
only
one
helen
hoped
the
comparison
was
undeserved
but
the
advice
was
sound
the
blankets
spread
out
on
the
grass
looked
inviting
and
they
felt
comfortably
warm
in
the
sunshine
the
breeze
was
slow
languorous
fragrant
and
it
brought
the
low
hum
of
the
murmuring
waterfall
like
a
melody
of
bees
helen
made
a
pillow
and
lay
down
to
rest
the
green
so
thin
and
fine
in
their
crisscross
network
showed
clearly
against
the
blue
sky
she
looked
in
vain
for
birds
then
her
gaze
went
wonderingly
to
the
lofty
fringed
rim
of
the
great
amphitheater
and
as
she
studied
it
she
began
to
grasp
its
remoteness
how
far
away
it
was
in
the
rarefied
atmosphere
a
black
eagle
sweeping
along
looked
of
tiny
size
and
yet
he
was
far
under
the
heights
above
how
pleasant
she
fancied
it
to
be
up
there
and
drowsy
fancy
lulled
her
to
sleep
helen
slept
all
afternoon
and
upon
awakening
toward
sunset
found
bo
curled
beside
her
dale
had
thoughtfully
covered
them
with
a
blanket
also
he
had
built
a
the
air
was
growing
keen
and
cold
later
when
they
had
put
their
coats
on
and
made
comfortable
seats
beside
the
fire
dale
came
over
apparently
to
visit
them
i
reckon
you
ca
sleep
all
the
time
he
said
an
bein
city
girls
you
get
lonesome
echoed
helen
the
idea
of
her
being
lonesome
here
had
not
occurred
to
her
i
thought
that
all
out
went
on
dale
as
he
sat
down
indian
fashion
before
the
blaze
it
natural
you
find
time
drag
up
here
bein
used
to
lots
of
people
an
an
work
an
all
girls
i
never
be
lonesome
here
replied
helen
with
her
direct
force
dale
did
not
betray
surprise
but
he
showed
that
his
mistake
was
something
to
ponder
over
excuse
me
he
said
presently
as
his
gray
eyes
held
hers
how
i
had
it
as
i
remember
girls
an
it
does
seem
long
since
i
left
home
most
of
them
would
die
of
lonesomeness
up
then
he
addressed
himself
to
bo
how
about
you
you
see
i
figured
you
be
the
one
that
liked
it
an
your
sister
the
one
who
i
wo
get
lonesome
very
soon
replied
bo
i
glad
it
worried
me
some
not
ever
havin
girls
as
company
before
an
in
a
day
or
so
when
you
rested
i
help
you
pass
the
bo
eyes
were
full
of
flashing
interest
and
helen
asked
him
how
it
was
a
sincere
expression
of
her
curiosity
and
not
doubtful
or
ironic
challenge
of
an
educated
woman
to
a
man
of
the
forest
but
as
a
challenge
he
took
it
how
he
repeated
and
a
strange
smile
flitted
across
his
face
why
by
givin
you
rides
an
climbs
to
beautiful
places
an
then
if
interested
to
show
you
how
little
civilized
people
know
of
helen
realized
then
that
whatever
his
calling
hunter
or
wanderer
or
hermit
he
was
not
uneducated
even
if
he
appeared
illiterate
i
be
happy
to
learn
from
you
she
said
me
too
chimed
in
bo
you
ca
tell
too
much
to
any
one
from
he
smiled
and
that
warmed
helen
to
him
for
then
he
seemed
less
removed
from
other
people
about
this
hunter
there
began
to
be
something
of
the
very
nature
of
which
he
spoke
a
stillness
aloofness
an
unbreakable
tranquillity
a
cold
clear
spirit
like
that
in
the
mountain
air
a
physical
something
not
unlike
the
tamed
wildness
of
his
pets
or
the
strength
of
the
pines
i
bet
i
can
tell
you
more
you
ever
remember
he
said
what
you
bet
retorted
bo
well
more
roast
turkey
against
say
somethin
nice
when
you
safe
an
home
to
your
uncle
al
runnin
his
agreed
nell
you
hear
helen
nodded
her
head
all
right
we
leave
it
to
nell
began
dale
half
seriously
now
i
tell
you
first
for
the
fun
of
passin
time
we
ride
an
race
my
horses
out
in
the
park
an
we
fish
in
the
brooks
an
hunt
in
the
woods
there
an
old
silvertip
around
that
you
can
see
me
kill
we
climb
to
the
peaks
an
see
wonderful
sights
so
much
for
that
now
if
you
really
want
to
learn
or
if
you
only
want
me
to
tell
you
well
that
no
matter
only
i
win
the
bet
you
see
how
this
park
lies
in
the
crater
of
a
volcano
an
was
once
full
of
water
an
how
the
snow
blows
in
on
one
side
in
winter
a
hundred
feet
deep
when
there
none
on
the
other
an
the
trees
how
they
grow
live
an
fight
one
another
an
depend
on
one
another
an
protect
the
forest
from
an
how
they
hold
the
water
that
is
the
fountains
of
the
great
rivers
an
how
the
creatures
an
things
that
live
in
them
or
on
them
are
good
for
them
an
neither
could
live
without
the
other
an
then
i
show
you
my
pets
tame
an
untamed
tell
you
how
it
man
that
makes
any
creature
wild
how
easy
they
are
to
tame
an
how
they
learn
to
love
you
an
there
the
life
of
the
forest
the
strife
of
it
how
the
bear
lives
an
the
cats
an
the
wolves
an
the
deer
you
see
how
cruel
nature
is
how
savage
wild
the
wolf
or
cougar
tears
down
the
deer
how
a
wolf
loves
fresh
hot
blood
an
how
a
cougar
unrolls
the
skin
of
a
deer
back
from
his
neck
an
you
see
that
this
cruelty
of
nature
this
work
of
the
wolf
cougar
is
what
makes
the
deer
so
beautiful
an
healthy
an
swift
sensitive
without
his
deadly
foes
the
deer
would
deteriorate
an
die
out
an
you
see
how
this
principle
works
out
among
all
creatures
of
the
forest
strife
it
the
meanin
of
all
creation
an
the
salvation
if
you
quick
to
see
you
learn
that
the
nature
here
in
the
wilds
is
the
same
as
that
of
men
only
men
are
no
longer
cannibals
trees
fight
to
live
birds
fight
animals
fight
men
fight
they
all
live
off
one
another
an
it
this
fightin
that
brings
them
all
closer
closer
to
bein
perfect
but
nothin
will
ever
be
but
how
about
religion
interrupted
helen
earnestly
nature
has
a
religion
an
it
to
live
to
grow
to
reproduce
each
of
its
but
that
is
not
god
or
the
immortality
of
the
soul
declared
helen
well
it
as
close
to
god
an
immortality
as
nature
ever
oh
you
would
rob
me
of
my
religion
no
i
just
talk
as
i
see
life
replied
dale
reflectively
as
he
poked
a
stick
into
the
red
embers
of
the
fire
maybe
i
have
a
religion
i
do
know
but
it
not
the
kind
you
have
not
the
bible
kind
that
kind
does
keep
the
men
in
pine
an
snowdrop
an
all
over
sheepmen
an
ranchers
an
farmers
an
travelers
such
as
i
known
the
religion
they
profess
does
keep
them
from
lyin
cheatin
stealin
killin
i
reckon
no
man
who
lives
as
i
do
which
perhaps
is
my
religion
will
lie
or
cheat
or
steal
or
kill
unless
it
to
kill
in
or
like
i
do
if
snake
anson
would
ride
up
here
now
my
religion
maybe
is
love
of
life
wild
life
as
it
was
in
the
beginnin
an
the
wind
that
blows
secrets
from
everywhere
an
the
water
that
sings
all
day
an
night
an
the
stars
that
shine
constant
an
the
trees
that
speak
somehow
an
the
rocks
that
are
dead
never
alone
here
or
on
the
trails
there
somethin
unseen
but
always
with
me
an
that
it
call
it
god
if
you
like
but
what
stalls
me
is
where
was
that
spirit
when
this
earth
was
a
ball
of
fiery
gas
where
will
that
spirit
be
when
all
life
is
frozen
out
or
burned
out
on
this
globe
an
it
hangs
dead
in
space
like
the
moon
that
time
will
come
there
no
waste
in
nature
not
the
littlest
atom
is
destroyed
it
changes
that
all
as
you
see
this
pine
wood
go
up
in
smoke
an
feel
somethin
that
heat
come
out
of
it
where
does
that
go
it
not
lost
nothin
is
lost
so
the
beautiful
an
savin
thought
is
maybe
all
rock
an
wood
water
an
blood
an
flesh
are
resolved
back
into
the
elements
to
come
to
life
somewhere
again
oh
what
you
say
is
wonderful
but
it
terrible
exclaimed
helen
he
had
struck
deep
into
her
soul
terrible
i
reckon
he
replied
sadly
then
ensued
a
little
interval
of
silence
milt
dale
i
lose
the
bet
declared
bo
with
earnestness
behind
her
frivolity
i
forgotten
that
reckon
i
talked
a
lot
he
said
apologetically
you
see
i
do
get
much
chance
to
talk
except
to
myself
or
tom
years
ago
when
i
found
the
habit
of
silence
settlin
down
on
me
i
took
to
thinkin
out
loud
an
talkin
to
i
could
listen
to
you
all
night
returned
bo
dreamily
do
you
read
do
you
have
books
inquired
helen
suddenly
yes
i
read
tolerable
well
a
good
deal
better
than
i
talk
or
write
he
replied
i
went
to
school
till
i
was
fifteen
always
hated
study
but
liked
to
read
years
ago
an
old
friend
of
mine
down
here
at
pine
widow
cass
she
gave
me
a
lot
of
old
books
an
i
packed
them
up
here
winter
the
time
i
conversation
lagged
after
that
except
for
desultory
remarks
and
presently
dale
bade
the
girls
good
night
and
left
them
helen
watched
his
tall
form
vanish
in
the
gloom
under
the
pines
and
after
he
had
disappeared
she
still
stared
nell
called
bo
shrilly
i
called
you
three
times
i
want
to
go
to
oh
i
i
was
thinking
rejoined
helen
half
embarrassed
half
wondering
at
herself
i
did
hear
i
should
smile
you
did
retorted
bo
wish
you
could
just
have
seen
your
eyes
nell
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
something
why
yes
said
helen
rather
feebly
she
did
not
at
all
when
bo
talked
like
that
you
going
to
fall
in
love
with
that
wild
hunter
declared
bo
in
a
voice
that
rang
like
a
bell
helen
was
not
only
amazed
but
enraged
she
caught
her
breath
preparatory
to
giving
this
incorrigible
sister
a
piece
of
her
mind
bo
went
calmly
on
i
can
feel
it
in
my
bo
you
a
little
fool
a
sentimental
romancing
gushy
little
fool
retorted
helen
all
you
seem
to
hold
in
your
head
is
some
rot
about
love
to
hear
you
talk
one
would
think
there
nothing
else
in
the
world
but
bo
eyes
were
bright
shrewd
affectionate
and
laughing
as
she
bent
their
steady
gaze
upon
helen
nell
that
just
it
there
is
nothing
else
chapter
x
the
night
of
sleep
was
so
short
that
it
was
difficult
for
helen
to
believe
that
hours
had
passed
bo
appeared
livelier
this
morning
with
less
complaint
of
aches
nell
you
got
color
exclaimed
bo
and
your
eyes
are
bright
the
morning
perfectly
lovely
could
you
get
drunk
on
that
air
i
smell
flowers
and
oh
i
hungry
bo
our
host
will
soon
have
need
of
his
hunting
abilities
if
your
appetite
holds
said
helen
as
she
tried
to
keep
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
while
she
laced
her
boots
look
there
a
big
dog
a
helen
looked
as
bo
directed
and
saw
a
hound
of
unusually
large
proportions
black
and
tan
in
color
with
long
drooping
ears
curiously
he
trotted
nearer
to
the
door
of
their
hut
and
then
stopped
to
gaze
at
them
his
head
was
noble
his
eyes
shone
dark
and
sad
he
seemed
neither
friendly
nor
unfriendly
hello
doggie
come
right
in
we
wo
hurt
you
called
bo
but
without
enthusiasm
this
made
helen
laugh
bo
you
simply
delicious
she
said
afraid
of
that
sure
wonder
if
he
dale
of
course
he
must
presently
the
hound
trotted
away
out
of
sight
when
the
girls
presented
themselves
at
the
they
espied
their
curious
canine
visitor
lying
down
his
ears
were
so
long
that
half
of
them
lay
on
the
ground
i
sent
pedro
over
to
wake
you
girls
up
said
dale
after
greeting
them
did
he
scare
you
pedro
so
that
his
name
no
he
did
exactly
scare
me
he
did
nell
though
she
an
awful
tenderfoot
replied
bo
he
a
dog
said
helen
ignoring
her
sister
sally
i
love
dogs
will
he
make
friends
he
shy
an
wild
you
see
when
i
leave
camp
he
wo
hang
around
he
an
tom
are
jealous
of
each
other
i
had
a
pack
of
hounds
an
lost
all
but
pedro
on
account
of
tom
i
think
you
can
make
friends
with
pedro
try
whereupon
helen
made
overtures
to
pedro
and
not
wholly
in
vain
the
dog
was
matured
of
almost
stern
aloofness
and
manifestly
not
used
to
people
his
deep
eyes
seemed
to
search
helen
soul
they
were
honest
and
wise
with
a
strange
sadness
he
looks
intelligent
observed
helen
as
she
smoothed
the
long
dark
ears
that
hound
is
nigh
human
responded
dale
come
an
while
you
eat
i
tell
you
about
dale
had
gotten
the
hound
as
a
pup
from
a
mexican
who
claimed
he
was
part
california
bloodhound
he
grew
up
becoming
attached
to
dale
in
his
younger
days
he
did
not
get
along
well
with
dale
other
pets
and
dale
gave
him
to
a
rancher
down
in
the
valley
pedro
was
back
in
dale
camp
next
day
from
that
day
dale
began
to
care
more
for
the
hound
but
he
did
not
want
to
keep
him
for
various
reasons
chief
of
which
was
the
fact
that
pedro
was
too
fine
a
dog
to
be
left
alone
half
the
time
to
shift
for
himself
that
fall
dale
had
need
to
go
to
the
farthest
village
snowdrop
where
he
left
pedro
with
a
friend
then
dale
rode
to
show
down
and
pine
and
the
camp
of
the
beemans
and
with
them
he
trailed
some
wild
horses
for
a
hundred
miles
over
into
new
mexico
the
snow
was
flying
when
dale
got
back
to
his
camp
in
the
mountains
and
there
was
pedro
gaunt
and
worn
overjoyed
to
welcome
him
home
roy
beeman
visited
dale
that
october
and
told
that
dale
friend
in
snowdrop
had
not
been
able
to
keep
pedro
he
broke
a
chain
and
scaled
a
fence
to
escape
he
trailed
dale
to
show
down
where
one
of
friends
recognizing
the
hound
caught
him
and
meant
to
keep
him
until
dale
return
but
pedro
refused
to
eat
it
happened
that
a
freighter
was
going
out
to
the
beeman
camp
and
dale
friend
boxed
pedro
up
and
put
him
on
the
wagon
pedro
broke
out
of
the
box
returned
to
show
down
took
up
dale
trail
to
pine
and
then
on
to
the
beeman
camp
that
was
as
far
as
roy
could
trace
the
movements
of
the
hound
but
he
believed
and
so
did
dale
that
pedro
had
trailed
them
out
on
the
hunt
the
following
spring
dale
learned
more
from
the
herder
of
a
sheepman
at
whose
camp
he
and
the
beemans
had
rested
on
the
way
into
new
mexico
it
appeared
that
after
dale
had
left
this
camp
pedro
had
arrived
and
another
mexican
herder
had
stolen
the
hound
but
pedro
got
away
an
he
was
here
when
i
arrived
concluded
dale
smiling
i
never
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
after
that
he
turned
out
to
be
the
finest
dog
i
ever
knew
he
knows
what
i
say
he
can
almost
talk
an
i
swear
he
can
cry
he
does
whenever
i
start
off
without
how
perfectly
wonderful
exclaimed
bo
are
animals
great
but
i
love
horses
it
seemed
to
helen
that
pedro
understood
they
were
talking
about
him
for
he
looked
ashamed
and
swallowed
hard
and
dropped
his
gaze
she
knew
something
of
the
truth
about
the
love
of
dogs
for
their
owners
this
story
of
dale
however
was
stranger
than
any
she
had
ever
heard
tom
the
cougar
put
in
an
appearance
then
and
there
was
scarcely
love
in
the
tawny
eyes
he
bent
upon
pedro
but
the
hound
did
not
deign
to
notice
him
tom
sidled
up
to
bo
who
sat
on
the
farther
side
of
the
tarpaulin
and
manifestly
wanted
part
of
her
breakfast
gee
i
love
the
look
of
him
she
said
but
when
he
close
he
makes
my
flesh
beasts
are
as
queer
as
people
observed
dale
they
take
likes
dislikes
i
believe
tom
has
taken
a
shine
to
you
an
pedro
begins
to
be
interested
in
your
sister
i
can
where
bud
inquired
bo
he
asleep
or
around
somewhere
now
soon
as
i
get
the
work
done
what
would
you
girls
like
to
do
ride
declared
bo
eagerly
are
you
sore
an
stiff
i
am
that
but
i
do
care
besides
when
i
used
to
go
out
to
my
uncle
farm
near
saint
joe
i
always
found
riding
to
be
a
cure
for
sure
is
if
you
can
stand
it
an
what
will
your
sister
like
to
do
returned
dale
turning
to
helen
oh
i
rest
and
watch
you
folks
and
dream
replied
helen
but
after
you
rested
you
must
be
active
said
dale
seriously
you
must
do
things
it
does
matter
what
just
as
long
as
you
do
sit
why
queried
helen
in
surprise
why
not
be
idle
here
in
this
beautiful
wild
place
just
to
dream
away
the
hours
the
days
i
could
do
but
you
must
it
took
me
years
to
learn
how
bad
that
was
for
me
right
now
i
would
love
nothin
more
than
to
forget
my
work
my
horses
an
pets
everythin
an
just
lay
around
seein
an
seeing
and
feeling
yes
that
must
be
what
i
mean
but
why
what
is
it
there
are
the
beauty
and
color
the
wild
shaggy
slopes
the
gray
cliffs
the
singing
wind
the
lulling
water
the
clouds
the
sky
and
the
silence
loneliness
sweetness
of
it
it
a
driftin
back
what
i
love
to
do
an
yet
fear
most
it
what
makes
a
lone
hunter
of
a
man
an
it
can
grow
so
strong
that
it
binds
a
man
to
the
how
strange
murmured
helen
but
that
could
never
bind
me
why
i
must
live
and
fulfil
my
mission
my
work
in
the
civilized
it
seemed
to
helen
that
dale
almost
imperceptibly
shrank
at
her
earnest
words
the
ways
of
nature
are
strange
he
said
i
look
at
it
different
nature
just
as
keen
to
wean
you
back
to
a
savage
state
as
you
are
to
be
civilized
an
if
nature
won
you
would
carry
out
her
design
all
the
this
hunter
talk
shocked
helen
and
yet
stimulated
her
mind
me
a
savage
oh
no
she
exclaimed
but
if
that
were
possible
what
would
nature
design
be
you
spoke
of
your
mission
in
life
he
replied
a
woman
mission
is
to
have
children
the
female
of
any
species
has
only
one
mission
to
reproduce
its
kind
an
nature
has
only
one
mission
toward
greater
strength
virility
efficiency
absolute
perfection
which
is
what
of
mental
and
spiritual
development
of
man
and
woman
asked
helen
both
are
direct
obstacles
to
the
design
of
nature
nature
is
physical
to
create
for
limitless
endurance
for
eternal
life
that
must
be
nature
inscrutable
design
an
why
she
must
but
the
soul
whispered
helen
ah
when
you
speak
of
the
soul
an
i
speak
of
life
we
mean
the
same
you
an
i
will
have
some
talks
while
you
here
i
must
brush
up
my
so
must
i
it
seems
said
helen
with
a
slow
smile
she
had
been
rendered
grave
and
thoughtful
but
i
guess
i
risk
dreaming
under
the
bo
had
been
watching
them
with
her
keen
blue
eyes
nell
it
take
a
thousand
years
to
make
a
savage
of
you
she
said
but
a
week
will
do
for
bo
you
were
one
before
you
left
saint
joe
replied
helen
do
you
remember
that
barnes
who
said
you
were
a
wildcat
and
an
indian
mixed
he
spanked
you
with
a
never
he
missed
me
retorted
bo
with
red
in
her
cheeks
nell
i
wish
you
not
tell
things
about
me
when
i
was
a
that
was
only
two
years
ago
expostulated
helen
in
mild
surprise
suppose
it
was
i
was
a
kid
all
right
i
bet
you
bo
broke
up
abruptly
and
tossing
her
head
she
gave
tom
a
pat
and
then
ran
away
around
the
corner
of
cliff
wall
helen
followed
leisurely
say
nell
said
bo
when
helen
arrived
at
their
little
green
hut
do
you
know
that
hunter
fellow
will
upset
some
of
your
theories
maybe
i
admit
he
amazes
me
and
affronts
me
too
i
afraid
replied
helen
what
surprises
me
is
that
in
spite
of
his
evident
lack
of
schooling
he
not
raw
or
crude
he
sister
dear
wake
up
the
man
wonderful
you
can
learn
more
from
him
than
you
ever
learned
in
your
life
so
can
i
always
hated
books
when
a
little
later
dale
approached
carrying
some
bridles
the
hound
pedro
trotted
at
his
heels
i
reckon
you
better
ride
the
horse
you
had
he
said
to
bo
whatever
you
say
but
i
hope
you
let
me
ride
them
all
by
and
sure
i
a
mustang
out
there
you
like
but
he
pitches
a
little
he
rejoined
and
turned
away
toward
the
park
the
hound
looked
after
him
and
then
at
helen
come
pedro
stay
with
me
called
helen
dale
hearing
her
motioned
the
hound
back
obediently
pedro
trotted
to
her
still
shy
and
soberly
watchful
as
if
not
sure
of
her
intentions
but
with
something
of
friendliness
about
him
now
helen
found
a
soft
restful
seat
in
the
sun
facing
the
park
and
there
composed
herself
for
what
she
felt
would
be
slow
sweet
idle
hours
pedro
curled
down
beside
her
the
tall
form
of
dale
stalked
across
the
park
out
toward
the
straggling
horses
again
she
saw
a
deer
grazing
among
them
how
erect
and
motionless
it
stood
watching
dale
presently
it
bounded
away
toward
the
edge
of
the
forest
some
of
the
horses
whistled
and
ran
kicking
heels
high
in
the
air
the
shrill
whistles
rang
clear
in
the
stillness
gee
look
at
them
go
exclaimed
bo
gleefully
coming
up
to
where
helen
sat
bo
threw
herself
down
upon
the
fragrant
and
stretched
herself
languorously
like
a
lazy
kitten
there
was
something
feline
in
her
lithe
graceful
outline
she
lay
flat
and
looked
up
through
the
pines
would
it
be
great
now
she
murmured
dreamily
half
to
herself
if
that
las
vegas
cowboy
would
happen
somehow
to
come
and
then
an
earthquake
would
shut
us
up
here
in
this
paradise
valley
so
we
never
get
out
bo
what
would
mother
say
to
such
talk
as
that
gasped
helen
but
nell
would
it
be
great
it
would
be
oh
there
never
was
any
romance
in
you
nell
rayner
replied
bo
that
very
thing
has
actually
happened
out
here
in
this
wonderful
country
of
wild
places
you
need
not
tell
me
sure
it
happened
with
the
and
the
indians
and
then
white
people
every
place
i
look
makes
me
feel
that
nell
you
have
to
see
people
in
the
moon
through
a
telescope
before
you
believe
i
practical
and
sensible
thank
goodness
but
for
the
sake
of
argument
protested
bo
with
flashing
eyes
suppose
it
might
happen
just
to
please
me
suppose
we
did
get
shut
up
here
with
dale
and
that
cowboy
we
saw
from
the
train
shut
in
without
any
hope
of
ever
climbing
out
what
would
you
do
would
you
give
up
and
pine
away
and
die
or
would
you
fight
for
life
and
whatever
joy
it
might
mean
is
the
first
instinct
replied
helen
surprised
at
a
strange
deep
thrill
in
the
depths
of
her
i
fight
for
life
of
yes
well
really
when
i
think
seriously
i
do
want
anything
like
that
to
happen
but
just
the
same
if
it
did
happen
i
would
glory
in
while
they
were
talking
dale
returned
with
the
horses
can
you
bridle
an
saddle
your
own
horse
he
asked
no
i
ashamed
to
say
i
ca
replied
bo
time
to
learn
then
come
on
watch
me
first
when
i
saddle
bo
was
all
eyes
while
dale
slipped
off
the
bridle
from
his
horse
and
then
with
slow
plain
action
readjusted
it
next
he
smoothed
the
back
of
the
horse
shook
out
the
blanket
and
folding
it
half
over
he
threw
it
in
place
being
careful
to
explain
to
bo
just
the
right
position
he
lifted
his
saddle
in
a
certain
way
and
put
that
in
place
and
then
he
tightened
the
cinches
now
you
try
he
said
according
to
helen
judgment
bo
might
have
been
a
western
girl
all
her
days
but
dale
shook
his
head
and
made
her
do
it
over
that
was
better
of
course
the
saddle
is
too
heavy
for
you
to
sling
it
up
you
can
learn
that
with
a
light
one
now
put
the
bridle
on
again
do
be
afraid
of
your
hands
he
wo
bite
slip
the
bit
in
sideways
there
now
let
see
you
when
bo
got
into
the
saddle
dale
continued
you
went
up
quick
light
but
the
wrong
way
watch
bo
had
to
mount
several
times
before
dale
was
satisfied
then
he
told
her
to
ride
off
a
little
distance
when
bo
had
gotten
out
of
earshot
dale
said
to
helen
she
take
to
a
horse
like
a
duck
takes
to
then
mounting
he
rode
out
after
her
helen
watched
them
trotting
and
galloping
and
running
the
horses
round
the
grassy
park
and
rather
regretted
she
had
not
gone
with
them
eventually
bo
rode
back
to
dismount
and
fling
herself
down
and
radiant
with
disheveled
hair
and
curls
damp
on
her
temples
how
alive
she
seemed
helen
senses
thrilled
with
the
grace
and
charm
and
vitality
of
this
surprising
sister
and
she
was
aware
of
a
sheer
physical
joy
in
her
presence
bo
rested
but
she
did
not
rest
long
she
was
soon
off
to
play
with
bud
then
she
coaxed
the
tame
doe
to
eat
out
of
her
hand
she
dragged
helen
off
for
wild
flowers
curious
and
thoughtless
by
turns
and
at
length
she
fell
asleep
quickly
in
a
way
that
reminded
helen
of
the
childhood
now
gone
forever
dale
called
them
to
dinner
about
four
as
the
sun
was
reddening
the
western
rampart
of
the
park
helen
wondered
where
the
day
had
gone
the
hours
had
flown
swiftly
serenely
bringing
her
scarcely
a
thought
of
her
uncle
or
dread
of
her
forced
detention
there
or
possible
discovery
by
those
outlaws
supposed
to
be
hunting
for
her
after
she
realized
the
passing
of
those
hours
she
had
an
intangible
and
indescribable
feeling
of
what
dale
had
meant
about
dreaming
the
hours
away
the
nature
of
paradise
park
was
inimical
to
the
kind
of
thought
that
had
habitually
been
hers
she
found
the
new
thought
absorbing
yet
when
she
tried
to
name
it
she
found
that
after
all
she
had
only
felt
at
the
meal
hour
she
was
more
than
usually
quiet
she
saw
that
dale
noticed
it
and
was
trying
to
interest
her
or
distract
her
attention
he
succeeded
but
she
did
not
choose
to
let
him
see
that
she
strolled
away
alone
to
her
seat
under
the
pine
bo
passed
her
once
and
cried
tantalizingly
my
nell
but
you
growing
romantic
never
before
in
helen
life
had
the
beauty
of
the
evening
star
seemed
so
exquisite
or
the
twilight
so
moving
and
shadowy
or
the
darkness
so
charged
with
loneliness
it
was
their
environment
the
accompaniment
of
wild
of
the
murmuring
waterfall
of
this
strange
man
of
the
forest
and
the
unfamiliar
elements
among
which
he
made
his
home
next
morning
her
energy
having
returned
helen
shared
bo
lesson
in
bridling
and
saddling
her
horse
and
in
riding
bo
however
rode
so
fast
and
so
hard
that
for
helen
to
share
her
company
was
impossible
and
dale
interested
and
amused
yet
anxious
spent
most
of
his
time
with
bo
it
was
thus
that
helen
rode
all
over
the
park
alone
she
was
astonished
at
its
size
when
from
almost
any
point
it
looked
so
small
the
atmosphere
deceived
her
how
clearly
she
could
see
and
she
began
to
judge
distance
by
the
size
of
familiar
things
a
horse
looked
at
across
the
longest
length
of
the
park
seemed
very
small
indeed
here
and
there
she
rode
upon
dark
swift
little
brooks
exquisitely
clear
and
and
almost
hidden
from
sight
by
the
long
grass
these
all
ran
one
way
and
united
to
form
a
deeper
brook
that
apparently
wound
under
the
cliffs
at
the
west
end
and
plunged
to
an
outlet
in
narrow
clefts
when
dale
and
bo
came
to
her
once
she
made
inquiry
and
she
was
surprised
to
learn
from
dale
that
this
brook
disappeared
in
a
hole
in
the
rocks
and
had
an
outlet
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
sometime
he
would
take
them
to
the
lake
it
formed
over
the
mountain
asked
helen
again
remembering
that
she
must
regard
herself
as
a
fugitive
will
it
be
safe
to
leave
our
i
forget
so
often
why
we
are
we
would
be
better
hidden
over
there
than
here
replied
dale
the
valley
on
that
side
is
accessible
only
from
that
ridge
an
do
worry
about
bein
found
i
told
you
roy
beeman
is
watchin
anson
an
his
gang
roy
will
keep
between
them
an
helen
was
reassured
yet
there
must
always
linger
in
the
background
of
her
mind
a
sense
of
dread
in
spite
of
this
she
determined
to
make
the
most
of
her
opportunity
bo
was
a
stimulus
and
so
helen
spent
the
rest
of
that
day
riding
and
tagging
after
her
sister
the
next
day
was
less
hard
on
helen
activity
rest
eating
and
sleeping
took
on
a
wonderful
new
meaning
to
her
she
had
really
never
known
them
as
strange
joys
she
rode
she
walked
she
climbed
a
little
she
dozed
under
her
she
worked
helping
dale
at
tasks
and
when
night
came
she
said
she
did
not
know
herself
that
fact
haunted
her
in
vague
deep
dreams
upon
awakening
she
forgot
her
resolve
to
study
herself
that
day
passed
and
then
several
more
went
swiftly
before
she
adapted
herself
to
a
situation
she
had
reason
to
believe
might
last
for
weeks
and
even
months
it
was
afternoon
that
helen
loved
best
of
all
the
time
of
the
day
the
sunrise
was
fresh
beautiful
the
morning
was
windy
fragrant
the
sunset
was
rosy
glorious
the
twilight
was
sad
changing
and
night
seemed
infinitely
sweet
with
its
stars
and
silence
and
sleep
but
the
afternoon
when
nothing
changed
when
all
was
serene
when
time
seemed
to
halt
that
was
her
choice
and
her
solace
one
afternoon
she
had
camp
all
to
herself
bo
was
riding
dale
had
climbed
the
mountain
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
trace
of
tracks
or
see
any
smoke
from
bud
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
nor
any
of
the
other
pets
tom
had
gone
off
to
some
sunny
ledge
where
he
could
bask
in
the
sun
after
the
habit
of
the
wilder
brothers
of
his
species
pedro
had
not
been
seen
for
a
night
and
a
day
a
fact
that
helen
had
noted
with
concern
however
she
had
forgotten
him
and
therefore
was
the
more
surprised
to
see
him
coming
limping
into
camp
on
three
legs
why
pedro
you
have
been
fighting
come
here
she
called
the
hound
did
not
look
guilty
he
limped
to
her
and
held
up
his
right
fore
paw
the
action
was
unmistakable
helen
examined
the
injured
member
and
presently
found
a
piece
of
what
looked
like
embedded
deeply
between
the
toes
the
wound
was
swollen
bloody
and
evidently
very
painful
pedro
whined
helen
had
to
exert
all
the
strength
of
her
fingers
to
pull
it
out
then
pedro
howled
but
immediately
he
showed
his
gratitude
by
licking
her
hand
helen
bathed
his
paw
and
bound
it
up
when
dale
returned
she
related
the
incident
and
showing
the
piece
of
shell
she
asked
where
did
that
come
from
are
there
shells
in
the
mountains
once
this
country
was
under
the
sea
replied
dale
i
found
things
that
make
you
under
the
sea
ejaculated
helen
it
was
one
thing
to
have
read
of
such
a
strange
fact
but
a
vastly
different
one
to
realize
it
here
among
these
lofty
peaks
dale
was
always
showing
her
something
or
telling
her
something
that
astounded
her
look
here
he
said
one
day
what
do
you
make
of
that
little
bunch
of
aspens
they
were
on
the
farther
side
of
the
park
and
were
resting
under
a
the
forest
here
encroached
upon
the
park
with
its
straggling
lines
of
spruce
and
groves
of
aspen
the
little
clump
of
aspens
did
not
differ
from
hundreds
helen
had
seen
i
do
make
anything
particularly
of
it
replied
helen
dubiously
just
a
tiny
grove
of
aspens
some
very
small
some
larger
but
none
very
big
but
it
pretty
with
its
green
and
yellow
leaves
fluttering
and
it
does
make
you
think
of
a
fight
fight
no
it
certainly
does
not
replied
helen
well
it
as
good
an
example
of
fight
of
strife
of
selfishness
as
you
will
find
in
the
forest
he
said
now
come
over
you
an
bo
let
me
show
you
what
i
come
on
nell
cried
bo
with
enthusiasm
he
open
our
eyes
some
nothing
loath
helen
went
with
them
to
the
little
clump
of
aspens
about
a
hundred
altogether
said
dale
they
pretty
well
shaded
by
the
spruces
but
they
get
the
sunlight
from
east
an
south
these
little
trees
all
came
from
the
same
seedlings
they
all
the
same
age
four
of
them
stand
say
ten
feet
or
more
high
an
they
as
large
around
as
my
wrist
here
one
that
largest
see
how
he
is
how
he
stands
over
most
of
the
others
but
not
so
much
over
these
four
next
to
him
they
all
stand
close
together
very
close
you
see
most
of
them
are
no
larger
than
my
thumb
look
how
few
branches
they
have
an
none
low
down
look
at
how
few
leaves
do
you
see
how
all
the
branches
stand
out
toward
the
east
an
south
how
the
leaves
of
course
face
the
same
way
see
how
one
branch
of
one
tree
bends
aside
one
from
another
tree
that
a
fight
for
the
sunlight
here
are
one
two
three
dead
trees
look
i
can
snap
them
off
an
now
look
down
under
them
here
are
little
trees
five
feet
high
four
feet
high
down
to
these
only
a
foot
high
look
how
pale
delicate
fragile
unhealthy
they
get
so
little
sunshine
they
were
born
with
the
other
trees
but
did
not
get
an
equal
start
position
gives
the
advantage
dale
led
the
girls
around
the
little
grove
illustrating
his
words
by
action
he
seemed
deeply
in
earnest
you
understand
it
a
fight
for
water
an
sun
but
mostly
sun
because
if
the
leaves
can
absorb
the
sun
the
tree
an
roots
will
grow
to
grasp
the
needed
moisture
shade
is
death
slow
death
to
the
life
of
trees
these
little
aspens
are
fightin
for
place
in
the
sunlight
it
is
a
merciless
battle
they
push
an
bend
one
another
branches
aside
choke
them
only
perhaps
half
of
these
aspens
will
survive
to
make
one
of
the
larger
clumps
such
as
that
one
of
trees
over
there
one
season
will
give
advantage
to
this
saplin
an
next
year
to
that
one
a
few
seasons
advantage
to
one
assures
its
dominance
over
the
others
but
it
is
never
sure
of
holdin
that
dominance
an
wind
or
storm
or
a
rival
does
not
overthrow
it
then
sooner
or
later
old
age
will
for
there
is
absolute
and
continual
fight
what
is
true
of
these
aspens
is
true
of
all
the
trees
in
the
forest
an
of
all
plant
life
in
the
forest
what
is
most
wonderful
to
me
is
the
tenacity
of
and
next
day
dale
showed
them
an
even
more
striking
example
of
this
mystery
of
nature
he
guided
them
on
horseback
up
one
of
the
thick
slopes
calling
their
attention
at
various
times
to
the
different
growths
until
they
emerged
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
where
the
timber
grew
scant
and
dwarfed
at
the
edge
of
he
showed
a
gnarled
and
knotted
twisted
out
of
all
semblance
to
a
beautiful
spruce
bent
and
with
almost
bare
branches
all
reaching
one
way
the
tree
was
a
specter
it
stood
alone
it
had
little
green
upon
it
there
seemed
something
tragic
about
its
contortions
but
it
was
alive
and
strong
it
had
no
rivals
to
take
sun
or
moisture
its
enemies
were
the
snow
and
wind
and
cold
of
the
heights
helen
felt
as
the
realization
came
to
her
the
knowledge
dale
wished
to
impart
that
it
was
as
sad
as
wonderful
and
as
mysterious
as
it
was
inspiring
at
that
moment
there
were
both
the
sting
and
sweetness
of
life
the
pain
and
the
joy
in
helen
heart
these
strange
facts
were
going
to
teach
her
to
transform
her
and
even
if
they
hurt
she
welcomed
them
chapter
xi
i
ride
you
if
it
breaks
my
neck
panted
bo
passionately
shaking
her
gloved
fist
at
the
gray
pony
dale
stood
near
with
a
broad
smile
on
his
face
helen
was
within
earshot
watching
from
the
edge
of
the
park
and
she
felt
so
fascinated
and
frightened
that
she
could
not
call
out
for
bo
to
stop
the
little
gray
mustang
was
a
beauty
and
racy
with
long
black
mane
and
tail
and
a
fine
spirited
head
there
was
a
blanket
strapped
on
his
back
but
no
saddle
bo
held
the
short
halter
that
had
been
fastened
in
a
hackamore
knot
round
his
nose
she
wore
no
coat
her
blouse
was
covered
with
grass
and
seeds
and
it
was
open
at
the
neck
her
hair
hung
loose
and
disheveled
one
side
of
her
face
bore
a
stain
of
grass
and
dirt
and
a
suspicion
of
blood
the
other
was
red
and
white
her
eyes
blazed
beads
of
sweat
stood
out
on
her
brow
and
wet
places
shone
on
her
cheeks
as
she
began
to
strain
on
the
halter
pulling
herself
closer
to
the
fiery
pony
the
outline
of
her
slender
shape
stood
out
lithe
and
strong
bo
had
been
defeated
in
her
cherished
and
determined
ambition
to
ride
dale
mustang
and
she
was
furious
the
mustang
did
not
appear
to
be
vicious
or
mean
but
he
was
spirited
tricky
mischievous
and
he
had
thrown
her
six
times
the
scene
of
bo
defeat
was
at
the
edge
of
the
park
where
thick
moss
and
grass
afforded
soft
places
for
her
to
fall
it
also
afforded
poor
foothold
for
the
gray
mustang
obviously
placing
him
at
a
disadvantage
dale
did
not
bridle
him
because
he
had
not
been
broken
to
a
bridle
and
though
it
was
harder
for
bo
to
try
to
ride
him
bareback
there
was
less
risk
of
her
being
hurt
bo
had
begun
in
all
eagerness
and
enthusiasm
loving
and
petting
the
mustang
which
she
named
she
had
evidently
anticipated
an
adventure
but
her
smiling
resolute
face
had
denoted
confidence
pony
had
stood
fairly
well
to
be
mounted
and
then
had
pitched
and
tossed
until
bo
had
slid
off
or
been
upset
or
thrown
after
each
fall
bo
bounced
up
with
less
of
a
smile
and
more
of
spirit
until
now
the
western
passion
to
master
a
horse
had
suddenly
leaped
to
life
within
her
it
was
no
longer
fun
no
more
a
daring
circus
trick
to
scare
helen
and
rouse
dale
admiration
the
issue
now
lay
between
bo
and
the
mustang
pony
reared
snorting
tossing
his
head
and
pawing
with
front
feet
pull
him
down
yelled
dale
bo
did
not
have
much
weight
but
she
had
strength
an
she
hauled
with
all
her
might
finally
bringing
him
down
now
hold
hard
an
take
up
rope
an
get
in
to
him
called
dale
good

sure
not
afraid
of
him
he
sees
that
now
hold

talk
to
him
tell
him

to
ride

pet
him
a
little
an
when
he
quits
shakin
grab
his
mane
an
jump
up
an
slide
a
leg
over
him
then
hook
your
feet
under
him
hard
as
you
can
an
stick
if
helen
had
not
been
so
frightened
for
bo
she
would
have
been
able
to
enjoy
her
other
sensations
creeping
cold
thrills
chased
over
her
as
bo
supple
and
quick
slid
an
arm
and
a
leg
over
pony
and
straightened
up
on
him
with
a
defiant
cry
pony
jerked
his
head
down
brought
his
feet
together
in
one
jump
and
began
to
bounce
bo
got
the
swing
of
him
this
time
and
stayed
on
you
ridin
him
yelled
dale
now
squeeze
hard
with
your
knees
crack
him
over
the
head
with
your
rope
that
the
way
hang
on
now
an
you
have
him
the
mustang
pitched
all
over
the
space
adjacent
to
dale
and
helen
tearing
up
the
moss
and
grass
several
times
he
tossed
bo
high
but
she
slid
back
to
grip
him
again
with
her
legs
and
he
could
not
throw
her
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
and
bolted
dale
answered
bo
triumphant
cry
but
pony
had
not
run
fifty
feet
before
he
tripped
and
fell
throwing
bo
far
over
his
head
as
luck
would
have
it
good
luck
dale
afterward
said
she
landed
in
a
boggy
place
and
the
force
of
her
momentum
was
such
that
she
slid
several
yards
face
down
in
wet
moss
and
black
ooze
helen
uttered
a
scream
and
ran
forward
bo
was
getting
to
her
knees
when
dale
reached
her
he
helped
her
up
and
half
led
half
carried
her
out
of
the
boggy
place
bo
was
not
recognizable
from
head
to
foot
she
was
dripping
black
ooze
oh
bo
are

cried
helen
evidently
bo
mouth
was
full
of
mud

replied
dale

that
lucky
with
eyes
and
nose
stopped
up
oooo
i
full
of
mud
and
my
nice
new
bo
tones
indicated
that
she
was
ready
to
cry
helen
realizing
bo
had
not
been
hurt
began
to
laugh
her
sister
was
the
object
that
had
ever
come
before
her
eyes
nell
rayner

laughing
at

demanded
bo
in
most
righteous
amaze
and
anger
me
bo
replied
helen

bo
but
i

was
laughing
too
but
noiselessly
and
bo
being
blind
for
the
moment
could
not
be
aware
of
that
by
this
time
they
had
reached
camp
helen
fell
flat
and
laughed
as
she
had
never
laughed
before
when
helen
forgot
herself
so
far
as
to
roll
on
the
ground
it
was
indeed
a
laughing
matter
dale
big
frame
shook
as
he
possessed
himself
of
a
towel
and
wetting
it
at
the
spring
began
to
wipe
the
mud
off
bo
face
but
that
did
not
serve
bo
asked
to
be
led
to
the
water
where
she
knelt
and
with
splashing
washed
out
her
eyes
and
then
her
face
and
then
the
bedraggled
strands
of
hair
that
mustang
did
break
my
neck
but
he
rooted
my
face
in
the
mud
i
fix
him
she
muttered
as
she
got
up

towel

holding
his
sides
bo

after

and
then
back
at
helen
i
suppose

kicked
and
smashed
and
killed

she
said
and
then
she
melted
oh
my
pretty
what
a
mess
i
must
be
a
sight
nell
i
rode
that
wild
pony
the
i
rode
him

for
me
you

want
it
was
funny
but
if
you
want
to
square
yourself
with
me
help
me
clean
my
late
in
the
night
helen
heard
dale
sternly
calling
pedro
she
felt
some
little
alarm
however
nothing
happened
and
she
soon
went
to
sleep
again
at
the
morning
meal
dale
explained
pedro
an
tom
were
uneasy
last
night
i
think
there
are
lions
over
the
ridge
somewhere
i
heard
one
scream
inquired
bo
with
interest
yes
an
if
you
ever
hear
a
lion
scream
you
will
think
it
a
woman
in
mortal
agony
the
cougar
cry
as
roy
calls
it
is
the
wildest
to
be
heard
in
the
woods
a
wolf
howls
he
is
sad
hungry
and
wild
but
a
cougar
seems
human
an
dyin
an
wild
we
saddle
up
an
ride
over
there
maybe
pedro
will
tree
a
lion
bo
if
he
does
will
you
shoot
it
sure
replied
bo
with
her
mouth
full
of
biscuit
that
was
how
they
came
to
take
a
long
slow
steep
ride
under
cover
of
dense
spruce
helen
liked
the
ride
after
they
got
on
the
heights
but
they
did
not
get
to
any
point
where
she
could
indulge
in
her
pleasure
of
gazing
afar
over
the
ranges
dale
led
up
and
down
and
finally
mostly
down
until
they
came
out
within
sight
of
sparser
wooded
ridges
with
parks
lying
below
and
streams
shining
in
the
sun
more
than
once
pedro
had
to
be
harshly
called
by
dale
the
hound
scented
game
here
an
old
kill
said
dale
halting
to
point
at
some
bleached
bones
scattered
under
a
spruce
tufts
of
hair
lay
strewn
around
what
was
it
asked
bo
deer
of
course
killed
there
an
eaten
by
a
lion
sometime
last
fall
see
even
the
skull
is
split
but
i
could
not
say
that
the
lion
did
helen
shuddered
she
thought
of
the
tame
deer
down
at
dale
camp
how
beautiful
and
graceful
and
responsive
to
kindness
they
rode
out
of
the
woods
into
a
grassy
swale
with
rocks
and
clumps
of
some
green
bushes
bordering
it
here
pedro
barked
the
first
time
helen
had
heard
him
the
hair
on
his
neck
bristled
and
it
required
stern
calls
from
dale
to
hold
him
in
dale
dismounted
hyar
pede
you
get
back
he
ordered
i
let
you
go
presently
girls
you
goin
to
see
somethin
but
stay
on
your
dale
with
the
hound
tense
and
bristling
beside
him
strode
here
and
there
at
the
edge
of
the
swale
presently
he
halted
on
a
slight
elevation
and
beckoned
for
the
girls
to
ride
over
here
see
where
the
grass
is
pressed
down
all
nice
an
round
he
said
pointing
a
lion
made
that
he
sneaked
there
watchin
for
deer
that
was
done
this
mornin
come
on
now
let
see
if
we
can
trail
dale
stooped
now
studying
the
grass
and
holding
pedro
suddenly
he
straightened
up
with
a
flash
in
his
gray
eyes
here
where
he
but
helen
could
not
see
any
reason
why
dale
should
say
that
the
man
of
the
forest
took
a
long
stride
then
another
an
here
where
that
lion
lit
on
the
back
of
the
deer
it
was
a
big
jump
see
the
sharp
hoof
tracks
of
the
dale
pressed
aside
tall
grass
to
show
dark
rough
fresh
tracks
of
a
deer
evidently
made
by
violent
action
come
on
called
dale
walking
swiftly
you
sure
goin
to
see
somethin
now
here
where
the
deer
bounded
carryin

girls
it
a
fresh
dale
walked
along
leading
his
horse
and
occasionally
he
pointed
down
into
the
grass
there
see
that
that
helen
did
see
some
tufts
of
grayish
hair
scattered
on
the
ground
and
she
believed
she
saw
little
dark
separations
in
the
grass
where
an
animal
had
recently
passed
all
at
once
dale
halted
when
helen
reached
him
bo
was
already
there
and
they
were
gazing
down
at
a
wide
flattened
space
in
the
grass
even
helen
inexperienced
eyes
could
make
out
evidences
of
a
struggle
tufts
of
hair
lay
upon
the
crushed
grass
helen
did
not
need
to
see
any
more
but
dale
silently
pointed
to
a
patch
of
blood
then
he
spoke
the
lion
brought
the
deer
down
here
an
killed
him
probably
broke
his
neck
that
deer
ran
a
hundred
yards
with
the
lion

trail

where
the
lion
dragged
the
deer

path

across
the
swale
girls

that
deer

few
minutes

queried
bo

that
grass

by
the
deer
bein
dragged
over
it
now
it
springin
dale
next
stop
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
swale
under
a
spruce
with
low
spreading
branches
the
look
of
pedro
quickened
helen
pulse
he
was
wild
to
give
chase
fearfully
helen
looked
where
dale
pointed
expecting
to
see
the
lion
but
she
saw
instead
a
deer
lying
prostrate
with
tongue
out
and
sightless
eyes
and
bloody
hair
girls
that
lion
heard
us
an
left
he
not
far
said
dale
as
he
stooped
to
lift
the
head
of
the
deer
warm
neck
broken
see
the
teeth
an
claw
marks
it
a
doe
look
here
do
be
squeamish
girls
this
is
only
an
hourly
incident
of
everyday
life
in
the
forest
see
where
the
lion
has
rolled
the
skin
down
as
neat
as
i
could
do
it
an
he
just
begun
to
bite
in
there
when
he
heard
what
murderous
work
the
sight
sickens
me
exclaimed
helen
it
is
nature
said
dale
simply
let
kill
the
lion
added
bo
for
answer
dale
took
a
quick
turn
at
their
and
then
mounting
he
called
to
the
hound
hunt
him
up
like
a
shot
the
hound
was
off
ride
in
my
tracks
an
keep
close
to
me
called
dale
as
he
wheeled
his
horse
we
off
squealed
bo
in
wild
delight
and
she
made
her
mount
plunge
helen
urged
her
horse
after
them
and
they
broke
across
a
corner
of
the
swale
to
the
woods
pedro
was
running
straight
with
his
nose
high
he
let
out
one
short
bark
he
headed
into
the
woods
with
dale
not
far
behind
helen
was
on
one
of
dale
best
horses
but
that
fact
scarcely
manifested
itself
because
the
others
began
to
increase
their
lead
they
entered
the
woods
it
was
open
and
fairly
good
going
bo
horse
ran
as
fast
in
the
woods
as
he
did
in
the
open
that
frightened
helen
and
she
yelled
to
bo
to
hold
him
in
she
yelled
to
deaf
ears
that
was
great
risk
she
did
not
intend
to
be
careful
suddenly
the
forest
rang
with
dale
encouraging
yell
meant
to
aid
the
girls
in
following
him
helen
horse
caught
the
spirit
of
the
chase
he
gained
somewhat
on
bo
hurdling
logs
sometimes
two
at
once
helen
blood
leaped
with
a
strange
excitement
utterly
unfamiliar
and
as
utterly
resistless
yet
her
natural
fear
and
the
intelligence
that
reckoned
with
the
foolish
risk
of
this
ride
shared
alike
in
her
sum
of
sensations
she
tried
to
remember
dale
caution
about
dodging
branches
and
snags
and
sliding
her
knees
back
to
avoid
knocks
from
trees
she
barely
missed
some
frightful
reaching
branches
she
received
a
hard
knock
then
another
that
unseated
her
but
frantically
she
held
on
and
slid
back
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
run
through
comparatively
open
forest
she
got
a
stinging
blow
in
the
face
from
a
branch
of
pine
bo
missed
by
what
seemed
only
an
inch
a
solid
snag
that
would
have
broken
her
in
two
both
pedro
and
dale
got
out
of
helen
sight
then
helen
as
she
began
to
lose
bo
felt
that
she
would
rather
run
greater
risks
than
be
left
behind
to
get
lost
in
the
forest
and
she
urged
her
horse
dale
yell
pealed
back
then
it
seemed
even
more
thrilling
to
follow
by
sound
than
by
sight
wind
and
brush
tore
at
her
the
air
was
heavily
pungent
with
odor
of
pine
helen
heard
a
wild
full
bay
of
the
hound
ringing
back
full
of
savage
eagerness
and
she
believed
pedro
had
roused
out
the
lion
from
some
covert
it
lent
more
stir
to
her
blood
and
it
surely
urged
her
horse
on
faster
then
the
swift
pace
slackened
a
windfall
of
timber
delayed
helen
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
dale
far
ahead
climbing
a
slope
the
forest
seemed
full
of
his
ringing
yell
helen
strangely
wished
for
level
ground
and
the
former
swift
motion
next
she
saw
bo
working
down
to
the
right
and
dale
yell
now
came
from
that
direction
helen
followed
got
out
of
the
timber
and
made
better
time
on
a
gradual
slope
down
to
another
park
when
she
reached
the
open
she
saw
bo
almost
across
this
narrow
open
ground
here
helen
did
not
need
to
urge
her
mount
he
snorted
and
plunged
at
the
level
and
he
got
to
going
so
fast
that
helen
would
have
screamed
aloud
in
mingled
fear
and
delight
if
she
had
not
been
breathless
her
horse
had
the
bad
luck
to
cross
soft
ground
he
went
to
his
knees
and
helen
sailed
out
of
the
saddle
over
his
head
soft
willows
and
wet
grass
broke
her
fall
she
was
surprised
to
find
herself
unhurt
up
she
bounded
and
certainly
did
not
know
this
new
helen
rayner
her
horse
was
coming
and
he
had
patience
with
her
but
he
wanted
to
hurry
helen
made
the
quickest
mount
of
her
experience
and
somehow
felt
a
pride
in
it
she
would
tell
bo
that
but
just
then
bo
flashed
into
the
woods
out
of
sight
helen
fairly
charged
into
that
green
foliage
breaking
brush
and
branches
she
broke
through
into
open
forest
bo
was
inside
riding
down
an
aisle
between
pines
and
spruces
at
that
juncture
helen
heard
melodious
yell
near
at
hand
coming
into
still
more
open
forest
with
rocks
here
and
there
she
saw
dale
dismounted
under
a
pine
and
pedro
standing
with
fore
paws
upon
the
and
then
high
up
on
a
branch
a
huge
tawny
colored
lion
just
like
tom
bo
horse
slowed
up
and
showed
fear
but
he
kept
on
as
far
as
horse
but
helen
refused
to
go
any
nearer
she
had
difficulty
in
halting
him
presently
she
dismounted
and
throwing
her
bridle
over
a
stump
she
ran
on
panting
and
fearful
yet
tingling
all
over
up
to
her
sister
and
dale
nell
you
did
pretty
good
for
a
tenderfoot
was
bo
greeting
it
was
a
fine
chase
said
dale
you
both
rode
well
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
the
lion
on
the
ground
he
bounded
great
long
bounds
with
his
tail
up
in
the
air
very
funny
an
pedro
almost
caught
up
with
him
that
scared
me
because
he
would
have
killed
the
hound
pedro
was
close
to
him
when
he
treed
an
there
he
is
the
yellow
he
a
male
an
full
with
that
dale
pulled
his
rifle
from
its
and
looked
expectantly
at
bo
but
she
was
gazing
with
great
interest
and
admiration
up
at
the
lion
is
he
just
beautiful
she
burst
out
oh
look
at
him
spit
just
like
a
cat
dale
he
looks
afraid
he
might
fall
he
sure
does
lions
are
never
sure
of
their
balance
in
a
tree
but
i
never
saw
one
make
a
misstep
he
knows
he
does
belong
to
helen
the
lion
looked
splendid
perched
up
there
he
was
long
and
round
and
graceful
and
tawny
his
tongue
hung
out
and
his
plump
sides
heaved
showing
what
a
quick
hard
run
he
had
been
driven
to
what
struck
helen
most
forcibly
about
him
was
something
in
his
face
as
he
looked
down
at
the
hound
he
was
scared
he
realized
his
peril
it
was
not
possible
for
helen
to
watch
him
killed
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
beg
bo
not
to
shoot
helen
confessed
she
was
a
tenderfoot
get
down
bo
an
let
see
how
good
a
shot
you
are
said
dale
bo
slowly
withdrew
her
fascinated
gaze
from
the
lion
and
looked
with
a
rueful
smile
at
dale
i
changed
my
mind
i
said
i
would
kill
him
but
now
i
ca
he
looks
so
so
different
from
what
i
dale
answer
was
a
rare
smile
of
understanding
and
approval
that
warmed
helen
heart
toward
him
all
the
same
he
was
amused
sheathing
the
gun
he
mounted
his
horse
come
on
pedro
he
called
come
i
tell
you
he
added
sharply
well
girls
we
treed
him
anyhow
an
it
was
fun
now
we
ride
back
to
the
deer
he
killed
an
pack
a
haunch
to
camp
for
our
own
will
the
lion
go
back
to
his
his
kill
i
think
you
called
it
asked
bo
i
chased
one
away
from
his
kill
half
a
dozen
times
lions
are
not
plentiful
here
an
they
do
get
overfed
i
reckon
the
balance
is
pretty
this
last
remark
made
helen
inquisitive
and
as
they
slowly
rode
on
the
dale
talked
you
girls
bein
an
not
knowin
the
life
of
the
forest
what
good
an
what
bad
think
it
was
a
pity
the
poor
deer
was
killed
by
a
murderous
lion
but
you
wrong
as
i
told
you
the
lion
is
absolutely
necessary
to
the
health
an
joy
of
wild
life
or
deer
wild
life
so
to
speak
when
deer
were
created
or
came
into
existence
then
the
lion
must
have
come
too
they
ca
live
without
each
other
wolves
now
are
not
particularly
they
live
off
elk
anythin
they
can
catch
so
will
lions
for
that
matter
but
i
mean
lions
follow
the
deer
to
an
fro
from
winter
to
summer
where
there
no
deer
you
will
find
no
lions
well
now
if
left
alone
deer
would
multiply
very
fast
in
a
few
years
there
would
be
hundreds
where
now
there
only
one
an
in
time
as
the
generations
passed
they
lose
the
fear
the
alertness
the
speed
an
strength
the
eternal
vigilance
that
is
love
of
life
they
lose
that
an
begin
to
deteriorate
an
disease
would
carry
them
off
i
saw
one
season
of
among
deer
it
killed
them
off
an
i
believe
that
is
one
of
the
diseases
of
the
lions
now
are
forever
on
the
trail
of
the
deer
they
have
learned
wariness
is
an
instinct
born
in
the
fawn
it
makes
him
keen
quick
active
fearful
an
so
he
grows
up
strong
an
healthy
to
become
the
smooth
sleek
beautiful
an
deer
you
girls
love
to
watch
but
if
it
was
for
the
lions
the
deer
would
not
thrive
only
the
strongest
an
swiftest
survive
that
is
the
meanin
of
nature
there
is
always
a
perfect
balance
kept
by
nature
it
may
vary
in
different
years
but
on
the
whole
in
the
long
years
it
averages
an
even
how
wonderfully
you
put
it
exclaimed
bo
with
all
her
impulsiveness
oh
i
glad
i
did
kill
the
what
you
say
somehow
hurts
me
said
helen
wistfully
to
the
hunter
i
see
i
feel
how
true
how
inevitable
it
is
but
it
changes
my
my
feelings
almost
i
rather
not
acquire
such
knowledge
as
yours
this
balance
of
nature
how
tragic
how
sad
but
why
asked
dale
you
love
birds
an
birds
are
the
greatest
killers
in
the
do
tell
me
that
do
prove
it
implored
helen
it
is
not
so
much
the
love
of
life
in
a
deer
or
any
creature
and
the
terrible
clinging
to
life
that
gives
me
distress
it
is
suffering
i
ca
bear
to
see
pain
i
can
stand
pain
myself
but
i
ca
bear
to
see
or
think
of
well
replied
dale
thoughtfully
there
you
stump
me
again
lived
long
in
the
forest
an
when
a
man
alone
he
does
a
heap
of
thinkin
an
always
i
could
understand
a
reason
or
a
for
pain
of
all
the
bafflin
things
of
life
that
is
the
hardest
to
understand
an
to
forgive
pain
that
evening
as
they
sat
in
restful
places
round
the
with
the
still
twilight
fading
into
night
dale
seriously
asked
the
girls
what
the
day
chase
had
meant
to
them
his
manner
of
asking
was
productive
of
thought
both
girls
were
silent
for
a
moment
glorious
was
bo
brief
and
eloquent
reply
why
asked
dale
curiously
you
are
a
girl
you
been
used
to
home
people
love
comfort
safety
maybe
that
is
just
why
it
was
glorious
said
bo
earnestly
i
can
hardly
explain
i
loved
the
motion
of
the
horse
the
feel
of
wind
in
my
face
the
smell
of
the
pine
the
sight
of
slope
and
forest
glade
and
windfall
and
rocks
and
the
black
shade
under
the
spruces
my
blood
beat
and
burned
my
teeth
clicked
my
nerves
all
quivered
my
heart
sometimes
at
dangerous
moments
almost
choked
me
and
all
the
time
it
pounded
hard
now
my
skin
was
hot
and
then
it
was
cold
but
i
think
the
best
of
that
chase
for
me
was
that
i
was
on
a
fast
horse
guiding
him
controlling
him
he
was
alive
oh
how
i
felt
his
running
well
what
you
say
is
as
natural
to
me
as
if
i
felt
it
said
dale
i
wondered
you
certainly
full
of
fire
an
helen
what
do
you
say
bo
has
answered
you
with
her
feelings
replied
helen
i
could
not
do
that
and
be
honest
the
fact
that
bo
would
shoot
the
lion
after
we
treed
him
acquits
her
nevertheless
her
answer
is
purely
physical
you
know
dale
how
you
talk
about
the
physical
i
should
say
my
sister
was
just
a
young
wild
highly
sensitive
female
of
the
species
she
exulted
in
that
chase
as
an
indian
her
sensations
were
inherited
ones
certainly
not
acquired
by
education
bo
always
hated
study
the
ride
was
a
revelation
to
me
i
had
a
good
many
of
feelings
though
not
so
strong
but
over
against
them
was
the
opposition
of
reason
of
consciousness
a
side
of
my
nature
confronted
me
strange
surprising
violent
irresistible
it
was
as
if
another
side
of
my
personality
suddenly
said
i
am
reckon
with
me
now
and
there
was
no
use
for
the
moment
to
oppose
that
strange
side
i
the
thinking
helen
rayner
was
powerless
oh
yes
i
had
such
thoughts
even
when
the
branches
were
stinging
my
face
and
i
was
thrilling
to
the
bay
of
the
hound
once
my
horse
fell
and
threw
me
you
need
look
alarmed
it
was
fine
i
went
into
a
soft
place
and
was
unhurt
but
when
i
was
sailing
through
the
air
a
thought
flashed
this
is
the
end
of
me
it
was
like
a
dream
when
you
are
falling
dreadfully
much
of
what
i
felt
and
thought
on
that
chase
must
have
been
because
of
what
i
have
studied
and
read
and
taught
the
reality
of
it
the
action
and
flash
were
splendid
but
fear
of
danger
pity
for
the
chased
lion
consciousness
of
foolish
risk
of
a
reckless
disregard
for
the
serious
responsibility
i
have
taken
all
these
worked
in
my
mind
and
held
back
what
might
have
been
a
sheer
physical
primitive
joy
of
the
wild
dale
listened
intently
and
after
helen
had
finished
he
studied
the
fire
and
thoughtfully
poked
the
red
embers
with
his
stick
his
face
was
still
and
serene
untroubled
and
unlined
but
to
helen
his
eyes
seemed
sad
pensive
expressive
of
an
unsatisfied
yearning
and
wonder
she
had
carefully
and
earnestly
spoken
because
she
was
very
curious
to
hear
what
he
might
say
i
understand
you
he
replied
presently
an
i
sure
surprised
that
i
can
i
read
my
books
an
reread
them
but
no
one
ever
talked
like
that
to
me
what
i
make
of
it
is
this
you
the
same
blood
in
you
that
in
bo
an
blood
is
stronger
than
brain
remember
that
blood
is
life
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
have
it
run
an
beat
an
burn
as
bo
did
your
blood
did
that
a
thousand
years
or
ten
thousand
before
intellect
was
born
in
your
ancestors
instinct
may
not
be
greater
than
reason
but
it
a
million
years
older
do
fight
your
instincts
so
hard
if
they
were
not
good
the
god
of
creation
would
not
have
given
them
to
you
your
mind
was
full
of
that
did
not
altogether
restrain
you
could
forget
yourself
you
could
feel
only
as
bo
did
you
could
be
true
to
your
real
i
do
agree
with
you
replied
helen
quickly
i
do
have
to
be
an
indian
to
be
true
to
why
yes
you
do
said
dale
but
i
could
be
an
indian
declared
helen
spiritedly
i
feel
only
as
you
say
bo
did
i
could
go
back
in
the
scale
as
you
hint
what
would
all
my
education
amount
to
though
goodness
knows
little
enough
if
i
had
no
control
over
primitive
feelings
that
happened
to
be
born
in
me
you
have
little
or
no
control
over
them
when
the
right
time
comes
replied
dale
your
sheltered
life
an
education
have
led
you
away
from
natural
instincts
but
they
in
you
an
you
learn
the
proof
of
that
out
no
not
if
i
lived
a
hundred
years
in
the
west
asserted
helen
but
child
do
you
know
what
you
talkin
about
here
bo
let
out
a
blissful
peal
of
laughter
mr
dale
exclaimed
helen
almost
affronted
she
was
stirred
i
know
myself
at
but
you
do
not
you
no
idea
of
yourself
you
education
yes
but
not
in
nature
an
life
an
after
all
they
are
the
real
things
answer
me
now
honestly
will
you
certainly
if
i
can
some
of
your
questions
are
hard
to
have
you
ever
been
starved
he
asked
no
replied
helen
have
you
ever
been
lost
away
from
home
have
you
ever
faced
death
real
stark
an
naked
death
close
terrible
no
have
you
ever
wanted
to
kill
any
one
with
your
bare
hands
oh
dale
you
you
amaze
me
no
no
i
reckon
i
know
your
answer
to
my
last
question
but
i
ask
it
anyhow
have
you
ever
been
so
madly
in
love
with
a
man
that
you
could
not
live
without
him
bo
fell
off
her
seat
with
a
high
trilling
laugh
oh
you
two
are
great
thank
heaven
i
have
been
replied
helen
shortly
then
you
do
know
anythin
about
life
declared
dale
with
finality
helen
was
not
to
be
put
down
by
that
dubious
and
troubled
as
it
made
her
have
you
experienced
all
those
things
she
queried
stubbornly
all
but
the
last
one
love
never
came
my
way
how
could
it
i
live
alone
i
seldom
go
to
the
villages
where
there
are
girls
no
girl
would
ever
care
for
me
i
have
nothin
but
all
the
same
i
understand
love
a
little
just
by
comparison
with
strong
feelin
i
helen
watched
the
hunter
and
marveled
at
his
simplicity
his
sad
and
penetrating
gaze
was
on
the
fire
as
if
in
its
white
heart
to
read
the
secret
denied
him
he
had
said
that
no
girl
would
ever
love
him
she
imagined
he
might
know
considerably
less
about
the
nature
of
girls
than
of
the
forest
to
come
back
to
myself
said
helen
wanting
to
continue
the
argument
you
declared
i
did
know
myself
that
i
would
have
no
i
will
i
meant
the
big
things
of
life
he
said
patiently
what
things
i
told
you
by
askin
what
had
never
happened
to
you
i
learned
what
will
those
experiences
to
come
to
me
breathed
helen
incredulously
never
sister
nell
they
sure
will
particularly
the
one
the
mad
love
chimed
in
bo
mischievously
yet
believingly
neither
dale
nor
helen
appeared
to
hear
her
interruption
let
me
put
it
simpler
began
dale
evidently
racking
his
brain
for
analogy
his
perplexity
appeared
painful
to
him
because
he
had
a
great
faith
a
great
conviction
that
he
could
not
make
clear
here
i
am
the
natural
physical
man
livin
in
the
wilds
an
here
you
come
the
complex
intellectual
woman
remember
for
my
argument
sake
that
you
here
an
suppose
circumstances
forced
you
to
stay
here
fight
the
elements
with
me
an
work
with
me
to
sustain
life
there
must
be
a
great
change
in
either
you
or
me
accordin
to
the
influence
an
ca
you
see
that
change
must
come
in
you
not
because
of
anythin
superior
in
me
i
really
inferior
to
you
but
because
of
our
environment
you
lose
your
complexity
an
in
years
to
come
be
a
natural
physical
woman
because
you
live
through
an
by
the
oh
dear
will
not
education
be
of
help
to
the
western
woman
queried
helen
almost
in
despair
sure
it
will
answered
dale
promptly
what
the
west
needs
is
women
who
can
raise
an
teach
children
but
you
do
understand
me
you
get
under
your
skin
i
reckon
i
ca
make
you
see
my
argument
as
i
feel
it
you
take
my
word
for
this
though
sooner
or
later
you
will
wake
up
an
forget
yourself
nell
i
bet
you
do
too
said
bo
seriously
for
her
it
may
seem
strange
to
you
but
i
understand
dale
i
feel
what
he
means
it
a
sort
of
shock
nell
we
not
what
we
seem
we
not
what
we
fondly
imagine
we
are
we
lived
too
long
with
people
too
far
away
from
the
earth
you
know
the
bible
says
something
like
this
thou
art
and
to
dust
thou
shalt
return
where
do
we
come
from
chapter
xii
days
passed
every
morning
helen
awoke
with
a
wondering
question
as
to
what
this
day
would
bring
forth
especially
with
regard
to
possible
news
from
her
uncle
it
must
come
sometime
and
she
was
anxious
for
it
something
about
this
simple
wild
camp
life
had
begun
to
grip
her
she
found
herself
shirking
daily
attention
to
the
clothes
she
had
brought
west
they
needed
it
but
she
had
begun
to
see
how
superficial
they
really
were
on
the
other
hand
tasks
had
come
to
be
a
pleasure
she
had
learned
a
great
deal
more
about
them
than
had
bo
worry
and
dread
were
always
impinging
upon
the
fringe
of
her
thoughts
always
vaguely
present
though
seldom
annoying
they
were
like
shadows
in
dreams
she
wanted
to
get
to
her
uncle
ranch
to
take
up
the
duties
of
her
new
life
but
she
was
not
prepared
to
believe
she
would
not
regret
this
wild
experience
she
must
get
away
from
that
in
order
to
see
it
clearly
and
she
began
to
have
doubts
of
herself
meanwhile
the
active
and
restful
outdoor
life
went
on
bo
leaned
more
and
more
toward
utter
reconciliation
to
it
her
eyes
had
a
wonderful
flash
like
blue
lightning
her
cheeks
were
gold
and
brown
her
hands
tanned
dark
as
an
indian
she
could
vault
upon
the
gray
mustang
or
for
that
matter
clear
over
his
back
she
learned
to
shoot
a
rifle
accurately
enough
to
win
praise
and
vowed
she
would
like
to
draw
a
bead
upon
a
grizzly
bear
or
upon
snake
anson
bo
if
you
met
that
grizzly
dale
said
has
been
prowling
round
camp
lately
you
run
right
up
a
tree
declared
helen
one
morning
when
bo
seemed
particularly
boastful
do
fool
yourself
retorted
bo
but
i
seen
you
run
from
a
mouse
sister
could
i
be
afraid
of
a
mouse
and
not
a
bear
i
do
see
well
bears
lions
outlaws
and
other
wild
beasts
are
to
be
met
with
here
in
the
west
and
my
mind
made
up
said
bo
in
deliberation
they
argued
as
they
had
always
argued
helen
for
reason
and
common
sense
and
restraint
bo
on
the
principle
that
if
she
must
fight
it
was
better
to
get
in
the
first
blow
the
morning
on
which
this
argument
took
place
dale
was
a
long
time
in
catching
the
horses
when
he
did
come
in
he
shook
his
head
seriously
some
varmint
been
chasin
the
horses
he
said
as
he
reached
for
his
saddle
did
you
hear
them
snortin
an
runnin
last
night
neither
of
the
girls
had
been
awakened
i
missed
one
of
the
colts
went
on
dale
an
i
goin
to
ride
across
the
dale
movements
were
quick
and
stern
it
was
significant
that
he
chose
his
heavier
rifle
and
mounting
with
a
sharp
call
to
pedro
he
rode
off
without
another
word
to
the
girls
bo
watched
him
for
a
moment
and
then
began
to
saddle
the
mustang
you
wo
follow
him
asked
helen
quickly
i
sure
will
replied
bo
he
did
forbid
but
he
certainly
did
not
want
he
might
not
want
you
but
i
bet
he
would
object
to
me
whatever
up
said
bo
shortly
oh
so
you
think
exclaimed
helen
keenly
hurt
she
bit
her
tongue
to
keep
back
a
hot
reply
and
it
was
certain
that
a
bursting
gush
of
anger
flooded
over
her
was
she
then
such
a
coward
did
dale
think
this
slip
of
a
sister
so
wild
and
wilful
was
a
stronger
woman
than
she
a
moment
silent
strife
convinced
her
that
no
doubt
he
thought
so
and
no
doubt
he
was
right
then
the
anger
centered
upon
herself
and
helen
neither
understood
nor
trusted
herself
the
outcome
proved
an
uncontrollable
impulse
helen
began
to
saddle
her
horse
she
had
the
task
half
accomplished
when
bo
call
made
her
look
up
listen
helen
heard
a
ringing
wild
bay
of
the
hound
that
pedro
she
said
with
a
thrill
sure
he
running
we
never
heard
him
bay
like
that
where
dale
he
rode
out
of
sight
across
there
replied
bo
pointing
and
running
toward
us
along
that
slope
he
must
be
a
mile
two
miles
from
but
dale
will
sure
but
he
need
wings
to
get
near
that
hound
now
pedro
have
gone
across
there
with
him
just
the
wild
note
of
the
hound
manifestly
stirred
bo
to
irrepressible
action
snatching
up
dale
lighter
rifle
she
shoved
it
into
her
and
leaping
on
the
mustang
she
ran
him
over
brush
and
brook
straight
down
the
park
toward
the
place
pedro
was
climbing
for
an
instant
helen
stood
amazed
beyond
speech
when
bo
sailed
over
a
big
log
like
a
then
helen
answered
to
further
unconsidered
impulse
by
frantically
getting
her
saddle
fastened
without
coat
or
hat
she
mounted
the
nervous
horse
bolted
almost
before
she
got
into
the
saddle
a
strange
trenchant
trembling
coursed
through
all
her
veins
she
wanted
to
scream
for
bo
to
wait
bo
was
out
of
sight
but
the
deep
muddy
tracks
in
wet
places
and
the
path
through
the
long
grass
afforded
helen
an
easy
trail
to
follow
in
fact
her
horse
needed
no
guiding
he
ran
in
and
out
of
the
straggling
spruces
along
the
edge
of
the
park
and
suddenly
wheeled
around
a
corner
of
trees
to
come
upon
the
gray
mustang
standing
still
bo
was
looking
up
and
listening
there
he
is
cried
bo
as
the
hound
bayed
ringingly
closer
to
them
this
time
and
she
spurred
away
helen
horse
followed
without
urging
he
was
excited
his
ears
were
up
something
was
in
the
wind
helen
had
never
ridden
along
this
broken
end
of
the
park
and
bo
was
not
easy
to
keep
up
with
she
led
across
bogs
brooks
swales
rocky
little
ridges
through
stretches
of
timber
and
groves
of
aspen
so
thick
helen
could
scarcely
squeeze
through
then
bo
came
out
into
a
large
open
offshoot
of
the
park
right
under
the
mountain
slope
and
here
she
sat
her
horse
watching
and
listening
helen
rode
up
to
her
imagining
once
that
she
had
heard
the
hound
look
look
bo
scream
made
her
mustang
stand
almost
straight
up
helen
gazed
up
to
see
a
big
brown
bear
with
a
frosted
coat
go
lumbering
across
an
opening
on
the
slope
it
a
grizzly
he
kill
pedro
oh
where
is
dale
cried
bo
with
intense
excitement
bo
that
bear
is
running
down
we
we
must
get
out
of
his
road
panted
helen
in
breathless
alarm
dale
has
had
time
to
be
close
oh
i
wish
he
come
i
do
know
what
to
ride
back
at
least
wait
for
just
then
pedro
spoke
differently
in
savage
barks
and
following
that
came
a
loud
growl
and
crashings
in
the
brush
these
sounds
appeared
to
be
not
far
up
the
slope
nell
do
you
hear
pedro
fighting
the
bear
burst
out
bo
her
face
paled
her
eyes
flashed
like
blue
steel
the
bear
kill
him
oh
that
would
be
dreadful
replied
helen
in
distress
but
what
on
earth
can
we
do
dale
called
bo
at
the
highest
pitch
of
her
piercing
voice
no
answer
came
a
heavy
crash
of
brush
a
rolling
of
stones
another
growl
from
the
slope
told
helen
that
the
hound
had
brought
the
bear
to
bay
nell
i
going
up
said
bo
deliberately
are
you
mad
returned
helen
the
bear
will
kill
he
might
kill
you
ride
that
way
and
yell
for
dale
rejoined
bo
what
will
you
do
gasped
helen
i
shoot
at
the
bear
scare
him
off
if
he
chases
me
he
ca
catch
me
coming
downhill
dale
said
you
crazy
cried
helen
as
bo
looked
up
the
slope
searching
for
open
ground
then
she
pulled
the
rifle
from
its
sheath
but
bo
did
not
hear
or
did
not
care
she
spurred
the
mustang
and
he
wild
to
run
flung
grass
and
dirt
from
his
heels
what
helen
would
have
done
then
she
never
knew
but
the
fact
was
that
her
horse
bolted
after
the
mustang
in
an
instant
seemingly
bo
had
disappeared
in
the
gold
and
green
of
the
forest
slope
helen
mount
climbed
on
a
run
snorting
and
heaving
through
aspens
brush
and
timber
to
come
out
into
a
narrow
long
opening
extending
lengthwise
up
the
slope
a
sudden
prolonged
crash
ahead
alarmed
helen
and
halted
her
horse
she
saw
a
shaking
of
aspens
then
a
huge
brown
beast
leaped
as
a
cat
out
of
the
woods
it
was
a
bear
of
enormous
size
helen
heart
stopped
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
the
bear
turned
his
mouth
was
open
red
and
dripping
he
looked
shaggy
gray
he
let
out
a
terrible
bawl
helen
every
muscle
froze
stiff
her
horse
plunged
high
and
sidewise
wheeling
almost
in
the
air
neighing
his
terror
like
a
stone
she
dropped
from
the
saddle
she
did
not
see
the
horse
break
into
the
woods
but
she
heard
him
her
gaze
never
left
the
bear
even
while
she
was
falling
and
it
seemed
she
alighted
in
an
upright
position
with
her
back
against
a
bush
it
upheld
her
the
bear
wagged
his
huge
head
from
side
to
side
then
as
the
hound
barked
close
at
hand
he
turned
to
run
heavily
uphill
and
out
of
the
opening
the
instant
of
his
disappearance
was
one
of
collapse
for
helen
frozen
with
horror
she
had
been
unable
to
move
or
feel
or
think
all
at
once
she
was
a
quivering
mass
of
cold
helpless
flesh
wet
with
perspiration
sick
with
a
shuddering
retching
internal
convulsion
her
mind
liberated
from
paralyzing
shock
the
moment
was
as
horrible
as
that
in
which
the
bear
had
bawled
his
frightful
rage
a
stark
icy
black
emotion
seemed
in
possession
of
her
she
could
not
lift
a
hand
yet
all
of
her
body
appeared
shaking
there
was
a
fluttering
a
strangling
in
her
throat
the
crushing
weight
that
surrounded
her
heart
eased
before
she
recovered
use
of
her
limbs
then
the
naked
and
terrible
thing
was
gone
like
a
nightmare
giving
way
to
consciousness
what
blessed
relief
helen
wildly
gazed
about
her
the
bear
and
hound
were
out
of
sight
and
so
was
her
horse
she
stood
up
very
dizzy
and
weak
thought
of
bo
then
seemed
to
revive
her
to
shock
different
life
and
feeling
throughout
all
her
cold
extremities
she
listened
she
heard
a
thudding
of
hoofs
down
the
slope
then
dale
clear
strong
call
she
answered
it
appeared
long
before
he
burst
out
of
the
woods
riding
hard
and
leading
her
horse
in
that
time
she
recovered
fully
and
when
he
reached
her
to
put
a
sudden
halt
upon
the
fiery
ranger
she
caught
the
bridle
he
threw
and
swiftly
mounted
her
horse
the
feel
of
the
saddle
seemed
different
dale
piercing
gray
glance
thrilled
her
strangely
you
white
are
you
hurt
he
said
no
i
was
but
he
threw
you
yes
he
certainly
threw
what
happened
we
heard
the
hound
and
we
rode
along
the
timber
then
we
saw
the
bear
a
monster
white
coated
i
know
it
a
grizzly
he
killed
the
colt
your
pet
hurry
now
what
about
bo
pedro
was
fighting
the
bear
bo
said
he
be
killed
she
rode
right
up
here
my
horse
followed
i
could
have
stopped
him
but
we
lost
bo
right
there
the
bear
came
out
he
roared
my
horse
threw
me
and
ran
off
pedro
barking
saved
me
my
life
i
think
oh
that
was
awful
then
the
bear
went
up
there
and
you
bo
followin
the
hound
ejaculated
dale
and
lifting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
he
sent
out
a
stentorian
yell
that
rolled
up
the
slope
rang
against
the
cliffs
pealed
and
broke
and
died
away
then
he
waited
listening
from
far
up
the
slope
came
a
faint
wild
cry
and
sweet
to
create
strange
echoes
floating
away
to
die
in
the
ravines
she
after
him
declared
dale
grimly
bo
got
your
rifle
said
helen
oh
we
must
you
go
back
ordered
dale
wheeling
his
horse
no
helen
felt
that
word
leave
her
lips
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
dale
spurred
ranger
and
took
to
the
open
slope
helen
kept
at
his
heels
until
timber
was
reached
here
a
steep
trail
led
up
dale
dismounted
horse
tracks
bear
tracks
dog
tracks
he
said
bending
over
have
to
walk
up
here
it
save
our
horses
an
maybe
time
is
bo
riding
up
there
asked
helen
eying
the
steep
ascent
she
sure
with
that
dale
started
up
leading
his
horse
helen
followed
it
was
rough
and
hard
work
she
was
lightly
clad
yet
soon
she
was
hot
laboring
and
her
heart
began
to
hurt
when
dale
halted
to
rest
helen
was
just
ready
to
drop
the
baying
of
the
hound
though
infrequent
inspirited
her
but
presently
that
sound
was
lost
dale
said
bear
and
hound
had
gone
over
the
ridge
and
as
soon
as
the
top
was
gained
he
would
hear
them
again
look
there
he
said
presently
pointing
to
fresh
tracks
larger
than
those
made
by
bo
mustang
elk
tracks
we
scared
a
big
bull
he
right
ahead
of
us
look
sharp
an
you
see
helen
never
climbed
so
hard
and
fast
before
and
when
they
reached
the
she
was
all
tuckered
out
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
get
on
her
horse
dale
led
along
the
crest
of
this
wooded
ridge
toward
the
western
end
which
was
considerably
higher
in
places
open
rocky
ground
split
the
green
timber
dale
pointed
toward
a
promontory
helen
saw
a
splendid
elk
silhouetted
against
the
sky
he
was
a
light
gray
over
all
his
hindquarters
with
shoulders
and
head
black
his
ponderous
antlers
towered
over
him
adding
to
the
wildness
of
his
magnificent
poise
as
he
stood
there
looking
down
into
the
valley
no
doubt
listening
for
the
bay
of
the
hound
when
he
heard
dale
horse
he
gave
one
bound
gracefully
and
wonderfully
carrying
his
antlers
to
disappear
in
the
green
again
on
a
bare
patch
of
ground
dale
pointed
down
helen
saw
big
round
tracks
toeing
in
a
little
that
gave
her
a
chill
she
knew
these
were
grizzly
tracks
hard
riding
was
not
possible
on
this
ridge
crest
a
fact
that
gave
helen
time
to
catch
her
breath
at
length
coming
out
upon
the
very
summit
of
the
mountain
dale
heard
the
hound
helen
eyes
feasted
afar
upon
a
wild
scene
of
rugged
grandeur
before
she
looked
down
on
this
western
slope
at
her
feet
to
see
bare
gradual
descent
leading
down
to
sparsely
wooded
bench
and
on
to
canuon
ride
hard
now
yelled
dale
i
see
bo
an
i
have
to
ride
to
catch
dale
spurred
down
the
slope
helen
rode
in
his
tracks
and
though
she
plunged
so
fast
that
she
felt
her
hair
stand
up
with
fright
she
saw
him
draw
away
from
her
sometimes
her
horse
slid
on
his
haunches
for
a
few
yards
and
at
these
hazardous
moments
she
got
her
feet
out
of
the
stirrups
so
as
to
fall
free
from
him
if
he
went
down
she
let
him
choose
the
way
while
she
gazed
ahead
at
dale
and
then
farther
on
in
the
hope
of
seeing
bo
at
last
she
was
rewarded
far
down
the
wooded
bench
she
saw
a
gray
flash
of
the
little
mustang
and
a
bright
glint
of
bo
hair
her
heart
swelled
dale
would
soon
overhaul
bo
and
come
between
her
and
peril
and
on
the
instant
though
helen
was
unconscious
of
it
then
a
remarkable
change
came
over
her
spirit
fear
left
her
and
a
hot
exalting
incomprehensible
something
took
possession
of
her
she
let
the
horse
run
and
when
he
had
plunged
to
the
foot
of
that
slope
of
soft
ground
he
broke
out
across
the
open
bench
at
a
pace
that
made
the
wind
bite
helen
cheeks
and
roar
in
her
ears
she
lost
sight
of
dale
it
gave
her
a
strange
grim
exultance
she
bent
her
eager
gaze
to
find
the
tracks
of
his
horse
and
she
found
them
also
she
made
out
the
tracks
of
bo
mustang
and
the
bear
and
the
hound
her
horse
scenting
game
perhaps
and
afraid
to
be
left
alone
settled
into
a
fleet
and
powerful
stride
sailing
over
logs
and
brush
that
open
bench
had
looked
short
but
it
was
long
and
helen
rode
down
the
gradual
descent
at
breakneck
speed
she
would
not
be
left
behind
she
had
awakened
to
a
heedlessness
of
risk
something
burned
steadily
within
her
a
grim
hard
anger
of
joy
when
she
saw
far
down
another
open
gradual
descent
that
dale
had
passed
bo
and
that
bo
was
riding
the
little
mustang
as
never
before
then
helen
flamed
with
a
madness
to
catch
her
to
beat
her
in
that
wonderful
chase
to
show
her
and
dale
what
there
really
was
in
the
depths
of
helen
rayner
her
ambition
was
to
be
she
divined
from
the
lay
of
the
land
ahead
but
the
ride
she
lived
then
for
a
flying
mile
was
something
that
would
always
blanch
her
cheeks
and
prick
her
skin
in
remembrance
the
open
ground
was
only
too
short
that
thundering
pace
soon
brought
helen
horse
to
the
timber
here
it
took
all
her
strength
to
check
his
headlong
flight
over
deadfalls
and
between
small
helen
lost
sight
of
bo
and
she
realized
it
would
take
all
her
wits
to
keep
from
getting
lost
she
had
to
follow
the
trail
and
in
some
places
it
was
hard
to
see
from
horseback
besides
her
horse
was
mettlesome
thoroughly
aroused
and
he
wanted
a
free
rein
and
his
own
way
helen
tried
that
only
to
lose
the
trail
and
to
get
sundry
knocks
from
trees
and
branches
she
could
not
hear
the
hound
nor
dale
the
pines
were
small
close
together
and
tough
they
were
hard
to
bend
helen
hurt
her
hands
scratched
her
face
barked
her
knees
the
horse
formed
a
habit
suddenly
of
deciding
to
go
the
way
he
liked
instead
of
the
way
helen
guided
him
and
when
he
plunged
between
saplings
too
close
to
permit
easy
passage
it
was
exceedingly
hard
on
her
that
did
not
make
any
difference
to
helen
once
worked
into
a
frenzy
her
blood
stayed
at
high
pressure
she
did
not
argue
with
herself
about
a
need
of
desperate
hurry
even
a
blow
on
the
head
that
nearly
blinded
her
did
not
in
the
least
retard
her
the
horse
could
hardly
be
held
and
not
at
all
in
the
few
open
places
at
last
helen
reached
another
slope
coming
out
upon
canuon
rim
she
heard
dale
clear
call
far
down
and
bo
answering
peal
high
and
piercing
with
its
note
of
exultant
wildness
helen
also
heard
the
bear
and
the
hound
fighting
at
the
bottom
of
this
canuon
here
helen
again
missed
the
tracks
made
by
dale
and
bo
the
descent
looked
impassable
she
rode
back
along
the
rim
then
forward
finally
she
found
where
the
ground
had
been
plowed
deep
by
hoofs
down
over
little
banks
helen
horse
balked
at
these
jumps
when
she
goaded
him
over
them
she
went
forward
on
his
neck
it
seemed
like
riding
straight
downhill
the
mad
spirit
of
that
chase
grew
more
stingingly
keen
to
helen
as
the
obstacles
grew
then
once
more
the
bay
of
the
hound
and
the
bawl
of
the
bear
made
a
demon
of
her
horse
he
snorted
a
shrill
defiance
he
plunged
with
fore
hoofs
in
the
air
he
slid
and
broke
a
way
down
the
steep
soft
banks
through
the
thick
brush
and
thick
clusters
of
saplings
sending
loose
rocks
and
earth
into
avalanches
ahead
of
him
he
fell
over
one
bank
but
a
thicket
of
aspens
upheld
him
so
that
he
rebounded
and
gained
his
feet
the
sounds
of
fight
ceased
but
thrilling
call
floated
up
on
the
air
before
helen
realized
it
she
was
at
the
foot
of
the
slope
in
a
narrow
full
of
rocks
and
trees
with
a
soft
roar
of
running
water
filling
her
ears
tracks
were
everywhere
and
when
she
came
to
the
first
open
place
she
saw
where
the
grizzly
had
plunged
off
a
sandy
bar
into
the
water
here
he
had
fought
pedro
signs
of
that
battle
were
easy
to
read
helen
saw
where
his
huge
tracks
still
wet
led
up
the
opposite
sandy
bank
then
helen
did
some
more
reckless
and
splendid
riding
on
level
ground
the
horse
was
great
once
he
leaped
clear
across
the
brook
every
plunge
every
turn
helen
expected
to
come
upon
dale
and
bo
facing
the
bear
the
canuon
narrowed
the
deepened
she
had
to
slow
down
to
get
through
the
trees
and
rocks
quite
unexpectedly
she
rode
upon
dale
and
bo
and
the
panting
pedro
her
horse
plunged
to
a
halt
answering
the
shrill
neighs
of
the
other
horses
dale
gazed
in
admiring
amazement
at
helen
say
did
you
meet
the
bear
again
he
queried
blankly
no
did
you
kill
him
panted
helen
slowly
sagging
in
her
saddle
he
got
away
in
the
rocks
rough
country
down
helen
slid
off
her
horse
and
fell
with
a
little
panting
cry
of
relief
she
saw
that
she
was
bloody
dirty
disheveled
and
wringing
wet
with
perspiration
her
riding
habit
was
torn
into
tatters
every
muscle
seemed
to
burn
and
sting
and
all
her
bones
seemed
broken
but
it
was
worth
all
this
to
meet
dale
penetrating
glance
to
see
bo
utter
incredulous
astonishment
nell
rayner
gasped
bo
if
my
horse
been
any
good
in
the
woods
panted
helen
i
not
lost
so
much
time
riding
down
this
mountain
and
i
caught
you
beat
girl
did
you
ride
down
this
last
slope
queried
dale
i
sure
did
replied
helen
smiling
we
walked
every
step
of
the
way
and
was
lucky
to
get
down
at
that
responded
dale
gravely
no
horse
should
have
been
ridden
down
there
why
he
must
have
slid
we
slid
yes
but
i
stayed
on
bo
incredulity
changed
to
wondering
speechless
admiration
and
rare
smile
changed
his
gravity
i
sorry
it
was
rash
of
me
i
thought
you
go
back
but
well
that
ends
well
helen
did
you
wake
up
she
dropped
her
eyes
not
caring
to
meet
the
questioning
gaze
upon
her
maybe
a
little
she
replied
and
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
remembrance
of
his
questions
of
his
assurance
that
she
did
not
know
the
real
meaning
of
life
of
her
stubborn
antagonism
made
her
somehow
ashamed
but
it
was
not
for
long
the
chase
was
great
she
said
i
did
not
know
myself
you
were
in
how
many
ways
did
you
find
me
right
he
asked
i
think
all
but
one
she
replied
with
a
laugh
and
a
shudder
near
starved
now
i
was
so
furious
at
bo
that
i
could
have
choked
her
i
faced
that
horrible
brute
oh
i
know
what
it
is
to
fear
death
i
was
lost
twice
on
the
ride
absolutely
lost
that
bo
found
her
tongue
the
last
thing
was
for
you
to
fall
wildly
in
love
was
it
according
to
dale
i
must
add
that
to
my
new
experiences
of
before
i
can
know
real
life
replied
helen
demurely
the
hunter
turned
away
let
us
go
he
said
soberly
chapter
xiii
after
more
days
of
riding
the
grassy
level
of
that
wonderfully
gold
and
purple
park
and
dreamily
listening
by
day
to
the
and
murmur
of
the
waterfall
and
by
night
to
the
wild
lonely
mourn
of
a
hunting
wolf
and
climbing
to
the
dizzy
heights
where
the
wind
stung
sweetly
helen
rayner
lost
track
of
time
and
forgot
her
peril
roy
beeman
did
not
return
if
occasionally
dale
mentioned
roy
and
his
quest
the
girls
had
little
to
say
beyond
a
recurrent
anxiety
for
the
old
uncle
and
then
they
forgot
again
paradise
park
lived
in
a
little
while
at
that
season
of
the
year
would
have
claimed
any
one
and
ever
afterward
haunted
sleeping
or
waking
dreams
bo
gave
up
to
the
wild
life
to
the
horses
and
rides
to
the
many
pets
and
especially
to
the
cougar
tom
the
big
cat
followed
her
everywhere
played
with
her
rolling
and
pawing
and
he
would
lay
his
massive
head
in
her
lap
to
purr
his
content
bo
had
little
fear
of
anything
and
here
in
the
wilds
she
soon
lost
that
another
of
dale
pets
was
a
black
bear
named
muss
he
was
abnormally
jealous
of
little
bud
and
he
had
a
hatred
of
tom
otherwise
he
was
a
very
bear
and
enjoyed
impartial
regard
tom
however
chased
muss
out
of
camp
whenever
back
was
turned
and
sometimes
muss
stayed
away
shifting
for
himself
with
the
advent
of
bo
who
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
on
the
animals
muss
manifestly
found
the
camp
more
attractive
whereupon
dale
predicted
trouble
between
tom
and
muss
bo
liked
nothing
better
than
a
frolic
with
the
black
bear
muss
was
not
very
big
nor
very
heavy
and
in
a
wrestling
bout
with
the
strong
and
wiry
girl
he
sometimes
came
out
second
best
it
spoke
well
of
him
that
he
seemed
to
be
careful
not
to
hurt
bo
he
never
bit
or
scratched
though
he
sometimes
gave
her
sounding
slaps
with
his
paws
whereupon
bo
would
clench
her
gauntleted
fists
and
sail
into
him
in
earnest
one
afternoon
before
the
early
supper
they
always
had
dale
and
helen
were
watching
bo
teasing
the
bear
she
was
in
her
most
vixenish
mood
full
of
life
and
fight
tom
lay
his
long
length
on
the
grass
watching
with
narrow
gleaming
eyes
when
bo
and
muss
locked
in
an
embrace
and
went
down
to
roll
over
and
over
dale
called
helen
attention
to
the
cougar
tom
jealous
it
strange
how
animals
are
like
people
pretty
soon
i
have
to
corral
muss
or
there
be
a
helen
could
not
see
anything
wrong
with
tom
except
that
he
did
not
look
playful
during
both
bear
and
cougar
disappeared
though
this
was
not
remarked
until
afterward
dale
whistled
and
called
but
the
rival
pets
did
not
return
next
morning
tom
was
there
curled
up
snugly
at
the
foot
of
bo
bed
and
when
she
arose
he
followed
her
around
as
usual
but
muss
did
not
return
the
circumstance
made
dale
anxious
he
left
camp
taking
tom
with
him
and
upon
returning
stated
that
he
had
followed
muss
track
as
far
as
possible
and
then
had
tried
to
put
tom
on
the
trail
but
the
cougar
would
not
or
could
not
follow
it
dale
said
tom
never
liked
a
bear
trail
anyway
cougars
and
bears
being
common
enemies
so
whether
by
accident
or
design
bo
lost
one
of
her
playmates
the
hunter
searched
some
of
the
slopes
next
day
and
even
went
up
on
one
of
the
mountains
he
did
not
discover
any
sign
of
muss
but
he
said
he
had
found
something
else
bo
you
girls
want
some
more
real
excitement
he
asked
helen
smiled
her
acquiescence
and
bo
replied
with
one
of
her
forceful
speeches
do
mind
bein
good
an
scared
he
went
on
you
ca
scare
me
bantered
bo
but
helen
looked
doubtful
up
in
one
of
the
parks
i
ran
across
one
of
my
horses
a
lame
bay
you
have
seen
well
he
had
been
killed
by
that
old
silvertip
the
one
we
chased
had
been
dead
over
an
hour
blood
was
still
runnin
an
only
a
little
meat
eaten
that
bear
heard
me
or
saw
me
an
made
off
into
the
woods
but
he

i
leave
pedro
home
when
they
had
hurried
supper
and
dale
had
gotten
in
the
horses
the
sun
had
set
and
the
valley
was
shadowing
low
down
while
the
ramparts
were
still
golden
the
long
zigzag
trail
dale
followed
up
the
slope
took
nearly
an
hour
to
climb
so
that
when
that
was
surmounted
and
he
led
out
of
the
woods
twilight
had
fallen
a
rolling
park
extended
as
far
as
helen
could
see
bordered
by
forest
that
in
places
sent
out
straggling
stretches
of
trees
here
and
there
like
islands
were
isolated
patches
of
timber
at
ten
thousand
feet
elevation
the
twilight
of
this
clear
and
cold
night
was
a
rich
and
rare
atmospheric
effect
it
looked
as
if
it
was
seen
through
perfectly
clear
smoked
glass
objects
were
singularly
visible
even
at
long
range
and
seemed
magnified
in
the
west
where
the
afterglow
of
sunset
lingered
over
the
dark
ragged
there
was
such
a
transparent
golden
line
melting
into
vivid
blue
that
helen
could
only
gaze
and
gaze
in
wondering
admiration
dale
spurred
his
horse
into
a
lope
and
the
spirited
mounts
of
the
girls
kept
up
with
him
the
ground
was
rough
with
tufts
of
grass
growing
close
together
yet
the
horses
did
not
stumble
their
action
and
snorting
betrayed
excitement
dale
led
around
several
clumps
of
timber
up
a
long
grassy
swale
and
then
straight
westward
across
an
open
flat
toward
where
the
raised
itself
wild
and
clear
against
the
cold
sky
the
horses
went
swiftly
and
the
wind
cut
like
a
blade
of
ice
helen
could
barely
get
her
breath
and
she
panted
as
if
she
had
just
climbed
a
laborsome
hill
the
stars
began
to
blink
out
of
the
blue
and
the
gold
paled
somewhat
and
yet
twilight
lingered
it
seemed
long
across
that
flat
but
really
was
short
coming
to
a
thin
line
of
trees
that
led
down
over
a
slope
to
a
deeper
but
still
isolated
patch
of
woods
dale
dismounted
and
tied
his
horse
when
the
girls
got
off
he
haltered
their
horses
also
stick
close
to
me
an
put
your
feet
down
easy
he
whispered
how
tall
and
dark
he
loomed
in
the
fading
light
helen
thrilled
as
she
had
often
of
late
at
the
strange
potential
force
of
the
man
stepping
softly
without
the
least
sound
dale
entered
this
straggly
bit
of
woods
which
appeared
to
have
narrow
byways
and
nooks
then
presently
he
came
to
the
top
of
a
slope
dark
as
pitch
apparently
but
as
helen
followed
she
perceived
the
trees
and
they
were
thin
dwarf
spruce
partly
dead
the
slope
was
soft
and
springy
easy
to
step
upon
without
noise
dale
went
so
cautiously
that
helen
could
not
hear
him
and
sometimes
in
the
gloom
she
could
not
see
him
then
the
chill
thrills
ran
over
her
bo
kept
holding
on
to
helen
which
fact
hampered
helen
as
well
as
worked
somewhat
to
disprove
bo
boast
at
last
level
ground
was
reached
helen
made
out
a
background
crossed
by
black
bars
another
glance
showed
this
to
be
the
dark
against
the
open
park
dale
halted
and
with
a
touch
brought
helen
to
a
straining
pause
he
was
listening
it
seemed
wonderful
to
watch
him
bend
his
head
and
stand
as
silent
and
motionless
as
one
of
the
dark
trees
he
not
there
yet
dale
whispered
and
he
stepped
forward
very
slowly
helen
and
bo
began
to
come
up
against
thin
dead
branches
that
were
invisible
and
then
cracked
then
dale
knelt
down
seemed
to
melt
into
the
ground
you
have
to
crawl
he
whispered
how
strange
and
thrilling
that
was
for
helen
and
hard
work
the
ground
bore
twigs
and
dead
branches
which
had
to
be
carefully
crawled
over
and
lying
flat
as
was
necessary
it
took
prodigious
effort
to
drag
her
body
inch
by
inch
like
a
huge
snake
dale
wormed
his
way
along
gradually
the
wood
lightened
they
were
nearing
the
edge
of
the
park
helen
now
saw
a
strip
of
open
with
a
high
black
wall
of
spruce
beyond
the
afterglow
flashed
or
changed
like
a
dimming
northern
light
and
then
failed
dale
crawled
on
farther
to
halt
at
length
between
two
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
come
up
beside
me
he
whispered
helen
crawled
on
and
presently
bo
was
beside
her
panting
with
pale
face
and
great
staring
eyes
plain
to
be
seen
in
the
wan
light
moon
comin
up
we
just
in
time
the
old
grizzly
not
there
yet
but
i
see
coyotes
dale
pointed
across
the
open
neck
of
park
to
a
dim
blurred
patch
standing
apart
some
little
distance
from
the
black
wall
that
the
dead
horse
whispered
dale
an
if
you
watch
close
you
can
see
the
coyotes
they
gray
an
they
move
ca
you
hear
them
helen
excited
ears
so
full
of
throbs
and
imaginings
presently
registered
low
snaps
and
snarls
bo
gave
her
arm
a
squeeze
i
hear
them
they
fighting
oh
gee
she
panted
and
drew
a
long
full
breath
of
unutterable
excitement
keep
quiet
now
an
watch
an
listen
said
the
hunter
slowly
the
black
ragged
seemed
to
grow
blacker
and
lift
slowly
the
gray
neck
of
park
lightened
under
some
invisible
influence
slowly
the
stars
paled
and
the
sky
filled
over
somewhere
the
moon
was
rising
and
slowly
that
vague
blurred
patch
grew
a
little
clearer
through
the
tips
of
the
spruce
now
seen
to
be
rather
close
at
hand
shone
a
slender
silver
crescent
moon
darkening
hiding
shining
again
climbing
until
its
exquisite
topped
the
trees
and
then
magically
it
cleared
them
radiant
and
cold
while
the
eastern
black
wall
shaded
still
blacker
the
park
blanched
and
the
opposite
began
to
stand
out
as
trees
look
look
cried
bo
very
low
and
fearfully
as
she
pointed
not
so
loud
whispered
dale
but
i
see
something
keep
quiet
he
admonished
helen
in
the
direction
bo
pointed
could
not
see
anything
but
bare
ground
rising
close
at
hand
to
a
little
ridge
lie
still
whispered
dale
i
goin
to
crawl
around
to
get
a
look
from
another
angle
i
be
right
he
moved
noiselessly
backward
and
disappeared
with
him
gone
helen
felt
a
palpitating
of
her
heart
and
a
prickling
of
her
skin
oh
my
nell
look
whispered
bo
in
fright
i
know
i
saw
on
top
of
the
little
ridge
a
round
object
moved
slowly
getting
farther
out
into
the
light
helen
watched
with
suspended
breath
it
moved
out
to
be
silhouetted
against
the
sky
apparently
a
huge
round
bristling
animal
frosty
in
color
one
instant
it
seemed
huge
the
next
small
then
close
at
hand
and
far
away
it
swerved
to
come
directly
toward
them
suddenly
helen
realized
that
the
beast
was
not
a
dozen
yards
distant
she
was
just
beginning
a
new
experience
a
real
and
horrifying
terror
in
which
her
blood
curdled
her
heart
gave
a
tremendous
leap
and
then
stood
still
and
she
wanted
to
fly
but
was
rooted
to
the
spot
when
dale
returned
to
her
side
that
a
pesky
porcupine
he
whispered
almost
crawled
over
you
he
sure
would
have
stuck
you
full
of
whereupon
he
threw
a
stick
at
the
animal
it
bounced
straight
up
to
turn
round
with
startling
quickness
and
it
gave
forth
a
rattling
sound
then
it
crawled
out
of
sight
por
cu
pine
whispered
bo
pantingly
it
might
as
well
have
been
an
elephant
helen
uttered
a
long
eloquent
sigh
she
would
not
have
cared
to
describe
her
emotions
at
sight
of
a
harmless
hedgehog
listen
warned
dale
very
low
his
big
hand
closed
over
gauntleted
one
there
you
have
the
real
cry
of
the
sharp
and
cold
on
the
night
air
split
the
cry
of
a
wolf
distant
yet
wonderfully
distinct
how
wild
and
mournful
and
hungry
how
marvelously
pure
helen
shuddered
through
all
her
frame
with
the
thrill
of
its
music
the
wild
and
unutterable
and
deep
emotions
it
aroused
again
a
sound
of
this
forest
had
pierced
beyond
her
life
back
into
the
dim
remote
past
from
which
she
had
come
the
cry
was
not
repeated
the
coyotes
were
still
and
silence
fell
absolutely
unbroken
dale
nudged
helen
and
then
reached
over
to
give
bo
a
tap
he
was
peering
keenly
ahead
and
his
strained
intensity
could
be
felt
helen
looked
with
all
her
might
and
she
saw
the
shadowy
gray
forms
of
the
coyotes
skulk
away
out
of
the
moonlight
into
the
gloom
of
the
woods
where
they
disappeared
not
only
dale
intensity
but
the
very
silence
the
wildness
of
the
moment
and
place
seemed
fraught
with
wonderful
potency
bo
must
have
felt
it
too
for
she
was
trembling
all
over
and
holding
tightly
to
helen
and
breathing
quick
and
fast
muttered
dale
under
his
breath
helen
caught
the
relief
and
certainty
in
his
exclamation
and
she
divined
then
something
of
what
the
moment
must
have
been
to
a
hunter
then
her
roving
alert
glance
was
arrested
by
a
looming
gray
shadow
coming
out
of
the
forest
it
moved
but
surely
that
huge
thing
could
not
be
a
bear
it
passed
out
of
gloom
into
silver
moonlight
helen
heart
bounded
for
it
was
a
great
bear
lumbering
along
toward
the
dead
horse
instinctively
helen
hand
sought
the
arm
of
the
hunter
it
felt
like
iron
under
a
rippling
surface
the
touch
eased
away
the
oppression
over
her
lungs
the
tightness
of
her
throat
what
must
have
been
fear
left
her
and
only
a
powerful
excitement
remained
a
sharp
expulsion
of
breath
from
bo
and
a
violent
jerk
of
her
frame
were
signs
that
she
had
sighted
the
grizzly
in
the
moonlight
he
looked
of
immense
size
and
that
wild
park
with
the
gloomy
blackness
of
forest
furnished
a
fit
setting
for
him
quick
mind
so
taken
up
with
emotion
still
had
a
thought
for
the
wonder
and
the
meaning
of
that
scene
she
wanted
the
bear
killed
yet
that
seemed
a
pity
he
had
a
wagging
rolling
slow
walk
which
took
several
moments
to
reach
his
quarry
when
at
length
he
reached
it
he
walked
around
with
sniffs
plainly
heard
and
then
a
cross
growl
evidently
he
had
discovered
that
his
meal
had
been
messed
over
as
a
whole
the
big
bear
could
be
seen
distinctly
but
only
in
outline
and
color
the
distance
was
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
then
it
looked
as
if
he
had
begun
to
tug
at
the
carcass
indeed
he
was
dragging
it
very
slowly
but
surely
look
at
that
whispered
dale
if
he
ai
strong
reckon
i
have
to
stop
the
grizzly
however
stopped
of
his
own
accord
just
outside
of
the
of
the
forest
then
he
hunched
in
a
big
frosty
heap
over
his
prey
and
began
to
tear
and
rend
jess
was
a
mighty
good
horse
muttered
dale
grimly
too
good
to
make
a
meal
for
a
hog
then
the
hunter
silently
rose
to
a
kneeling
position
swinging
the
rifle
in
front
of
him
he
glanced
up
into
the
low
branches
of
the
tree
overhead
girls
there
no
tellin
what
a
grizzly
will
do
if
i
yell
you
climb
up
in
this
tree
an
do
it
with
that
he
leveled
the
rifle
resting
his
left
elbow
on
his
knee
the
front
end
of
the
rifle
reaching
out
of
the
shade
shone
silver
in
the
moonlight
man
and
weapon
became
still
as
stone
helen
held
her
breath
but
dale
relaxed
lowering
the
barrel
ca
see
the
sights
very
well
he
whispered
shaking
his
head
remember
now
if
i
yell
you
climb
again
he
aimed
and
slowly
grew
rigid
helen
could
not
take
her
fascinated
eyes
off
him
he
knelt
bareheaded
and
in
the
shadow
she
could
make
out
the
gleam
of
his
profile
stern
and
cold
a
streak
of
fire
and
a
heavy
report
startled
her
then
she
heard
the
bullet
hit
shifting
her
glance
she
saw
the
bear
lurch
with
convulsive
action
rearing
on
his
hind
legs
loud
clicking
snaps
must
have
been
a
clashing
of
his
jaws
in
rage
but
there
was
no
other
sound
then
again
dale
heavy
gun
boomed
helen
heard
again
that
singular
spatting
thud
of
striking
lead
the
bear
went
down
with
a
flop
as
if
he
had
been
dealt
a
terrific
blow
but
just
as
quickly
he
was
up
on
and
began
to
whirl
with
hoarse
savage
bawls
of
agony
and
fury
his
action
quickly
carried
him
out
of
the
moonlight
into
the
shadow
where
he
disappeared
there
the
bawls
gave
place
to
gnashing
snarls
and
crashings
in
the
brush
and
snapping
of
branches
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
forest
sure
he
mad
said
dale
rising
to
his
feet
an
i
reckon
hard
hit
but
i
wo
follow
him
both
the
girls
got
up
and
helen
found
she
was
shaky
on
her
feet
and
very
cold
was
it
cried
bo
are
you
scared
your
teeth
are
chatterin
queried
dale
i
well
it
sure
is
cold
all
right
he
responded
now
the
fun
over
you
feel
it
nell
you
froze
too
helen
nodded
she
was
indeed
as
cold
as
she
had
ever
been
before
but
that
did
not
prevent
a
strange
warmness
along
her
veins
and
a
quickened
pulse
the
cause
of
which
she
did
not
conjecture
let
rustle
said
dale
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
wood
and
skirted
its
edge
around
to
the
slope
there
they
climbed
to
the
flat
and
went
through
the
straggling
line
of
trees
to
where
the
horses
were
tethered
up
here
the
wind
began
to
blow
not
hard
through
the
forest
but
still
strong
and
steady
out
in
the
open
and
bitterly
cold
dale
helped
bo
to
mount
and
then
helen
i
numb
she
said
i
fall
off
no
you
be
warm
in
a
jiffy
he
replied
because
we
ride
some
goin
back
let
ranger
pick
the
way
an
you
hang
with
ranger
first
jump
helen
blood
began
to
run
out
he
shot
his
lean
dark
head
beside
dale
horse
the
wild
park
lay
clear
and
bright
in
the
moonlight
with
strange
silvery
radiance
on
the
grass
the
patches
of
timber
like
spired
black
islands
in
a
lake
seemed
to
harbor
shadows
and
places
for
bears
to
hide
ready
to
spring
out
as
helen
neared
each
little
grove
her
pulses
shook
and
her
heart
beat
half
a
mile
of
rapid
riding
burned
out
the
cold
and
all
seemed
glorious
the
sailing
moon
white
in
a
sky
the
white
passionless
stars
so
solemn
so
far
away
the
beckoning
fringe
of
at
once
mysterious
and
friendly
and
the
fleet
horses
running
with
soft
rhythmic
thuds
over
the
grass
leaping
the
ditches
and
the
hollows
making
the
bitter
wind
sting
and
cut
coming
up
that
park
the
ride
had
been
long
going
back
was
as
short
as
it
was
thrilling
in
helen
experiences
gathered
realization
slowly
and
it
was
this
swift
ride
the
horses
neck
and
neck
and
all
the
wildness
and
beauty
that
completed
the
slow
insidious
work
of
years
the
tears
of
excitement
froze
on
her
cheeks
and
her
heart
heaved
full
all
that
pertained
to
this
night
got
into
her
blood
it
was
only
to
feel
to
live
now
but
it
could
be
understood
and
remembered
forever
afterward
dale
horse
a
little
in
advance
sailed
over
a
ditch
ranger
made
a
splendid
leap
but
he
alighted
among
some
grassy
tufts
and
fell
helen
shot
over
his
head
she
struck
lengthwise
her
arms
stretched
and
slid
hard
to
a
shocking
impact
that
stunned
her
bo
scream
rang
in
her
ears
she
felt
the
wet
grass
under
her
face
and
then
the
strong
hands
that
lifted
her
dale
loomed
over
her
bending
down
to
look
into
her
face
bo
was
clutching
her
with
frantic
hands
and
helen
could
only
gasp
her
breast
seemed
caved
in
the
need
to
breathe
was
torture
nell
you
not
hurt
you
fell
light
like
a
feather
all
grass
here
you
ca
be
hurt
said
dale
sharply
his
anxious
voice
penetrated
beyond
her
hearing
and
his
strong
hands
went
swiftly
over
her
arms
and
shoulders
feeling
for
broken
bones
just
had
the
wind
knocked
out
of
you
went
on
dale
it
feels
awful
but
it
helen
got
a
little
air
that
was
like
hot
in
her
lungs
and
then
a
deeper
breath
and
then
full
gasping
respiration
i
guess
i
not
hurt
not
a
bit
she
choked
out
you
sure
had
a
header
never
saw
a
prettier
spill
ranger
does
do
that
often
i
reckon
we
were
travelin
too
fast
but
it
was
fun
you
think
it
was
bo
who
answered
oh
glorious
but
gee
i
was
dale
still
held
helen
hands
she
released
them
while
looking
up
at
him
the
moment
was
realization
for
her
of
what
for
days
had
been
a
vague
sweet
uncertainty
becoming
near
and
strange
disturbing
and
present
this
accident
had
been
a
sudden
violent
end
to
the
wonderful
ride
but
its
effect
the
knowledge
of
what
had
got
into
her
blood
would
never
change
and
inseparable
from
it
was
this
man
of
the
forest
chapter
xiv
on
the
next
morning
helen
was
awakened
by
what
she
imagined
had
been
a
dream
of
some
one
shouting
with
a
start
she
sat
up
the
sunshine
showed
pink
and
gold
on
the
ragged
spruce
line
of
the
mountain
rims
bo
was
on
her
knees
braiding
her
hair
with
shaking
hands
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
peep
out
and
the
echoes
of
a
ringing
cry
were
cracking
back
from
the
cliffs
that
had
been
dale
voice
nell
nell
wake
up
called
bo
wildly
oh
some
one
come
horses
and
men
helen
got
to
her
knees
and
peered
out
over
bo
shoulder
dale
standing
tall
and
striking
beside
the
campfire
was
waving
his
sombrero
away
down
the
open
edge
of
the
park
came
a
string
of
with
mounted
men
behind
in
the
foremost
rider
helen
recognized
roy
beeman
that
first
one
roy
she
exclaimed
i
never
forget
him
on
a
horse
bo
it
must
mean
uncle
al
come
sure
we
born
lucky
here
we
are
safe
and
sound
and
all
this
grand
camp
trip
look
at
the
cowboys
look
oh
maybe
this
is
great
babbled
bo
dale
wheeled
to
see
the
girls
peeping
out
it
time
you
up
he
called
your
uncle
al
is
for
an
instant
after
helen
sank
back
out
of
dale
sight
she
sat
there
perfectly
motionless
so
struck
was
she
by
the
singular
tone
of
voice
she
imagined
that
he
regretted
what
this
visiting
cavalcade
of
horsemen
meant
they
had
come
to
take
her
to
her
ranch
in
pine
heart
suddenly
began
to
beat
fast
but
thickly
as
if
muffled
within
her
breast
hurry
now
girls
called
dale
bo
was
already
out
kneeling
on
the
flat
stone
at
the
little
brook
splashing
water
in
a
great
hurry
helen
hands
trembled
so
that
she
could
scarcely
lace
her
boots
or
brush
her
hair
and
she
was
long
behind
bo
in
making
herself
presentable
when
helen
stepped
out
a
short
powerfully
built
man
in
coarse
garb
and
heavy
boots
stood
holding
hands
wal
wal
you
favor
the
rayners
he
was
saying
i
remember
your
dad
an
a
fine
feller
he
beside

roy
and
beyond
was
a
group
of
horses
and
riders
uncle
here

said
bo
softly
aw
the
old
breathed
hard
as
he
turned
helen
hurried
she
had
not
expected
to
remember
this
uncle
but
one
look
into
the
brown
beaming
face
with
the
blue
eyes
flashing
yet
sad
and
she
recognized
him
at
the
same
instant
recalling
her
mother
he
held
out
his
arms
to
receive
her
nell
auchincloss
all
over
again
he
exclaimed
in
deep
voice
as
he
kissed
her

murmured
helen

handsomest
auchincloss
i

helen
found
herself
blushing
and
withdrew
her
hands
from
his
as
roy
stepped
forward
to
pay
his
respects
he
stood
bareheaded
lean
and
tall
with
neither
his
clear
eyes
nor
his
still
face
nor
the
proffered
hand
expressing
anything
of
the
proven
quality
of
fidelity
of
achievement
that
helen
sensed
in
him
howdy
miss

said

the

to
the
rustic
seat

built
for

under

big
pine

thet

beasley
in

grave
gaze
his
face
changed
swiftly
and
all
the
serried
years
of
toil
and
battle
and
privation
showed
with
something
that
was
not
age
nor
resignation
yet
as
tragic
as
both
wal
never
mind
him
now
he
added
slowly
and
the
warmer
light
returned
to
his
face
dale
come
the
hunter
stepped
closer

said
auchincloss
with
an
arm
around

thoughtfully
as

looked

hunter
an
you

proffered
hand

an

with
us
i
call
the
girls
to
breakfast
replied
dale
and
he
moved
away
without
answering
auchincloss
query
helen
divined
that
dale
did
not
mean
to
go
down
to
pine
with
them
and
the
knowledge
gave
her
a
blank
feeling
of
surprise
had
she
expected
him
to
go
come
here
jeff
called
al
to
one
of
his
men
a
short
horseman
with
dusty
garb
and
face
hobbled
forth
from
the
group
he
was
not
young
but
he
had
a
boyish
grin
and
bright
little
eyes
awkwardly
he
doffed
his
slouch
sombrero
jeff
shake
hands
with
my
nieces
said
al
this
helen
an
your
boss
from
now
on
an
this
bo
fer
short
her
name
was
nancy
but
when
she
lay
a
baby
in
her
cradle
i
called
her
an
the
stuck
girls
this
here
my
foreman
jeff
mulvey
who
been
with
me
twenty
the
introduction
caused
embarrassment
to
all
three
principals
particularly
to
jeff
jeff
throw
the
packs
an
saddles
fer
a
rest
was
al
order
to
his
foreman
nell
reckon
you
have
fun
bossin
thet
outfit
chuckled
al
none
of

a
wife
lot
of
scalawags
they
are
no
women

have
them
uncle
i
hope
i
never

be
their
boss
replied
helen
wal
you
goin
to
be
right
off
declared
al
they
ai
a
bad
lot
after
all
an
i
got
a
likely
new
with
that
he
turned
to
bo
and
after
studying
her
pretty
face
he
asked
in
apparently
severe
tone
did
you
send
a
cowboy
named
carmichael
to
ask
me
for
a
job
bo
looked
quite
startled
carmichael
why
uncle
i
never
heard
that
name
before
replied
bo
bewilderedly
reckoned
the
young
rascal
was
lyin
said
auchincloss
but
i
liked
the
fellar
looks
an
so
let
him
then
the
rancher
turned
to
the
group
of
lounging
riders
las
vegas
come
here
he
ordered
in
a
loud
voice
helen
thrilled
at
sight
of
a
tall
superbly
built
cowboy
reluctantly
detaching
himself
from
the
group
he
had
a
face
young
like
a
boy
helen
recognized
it
and
the
flowing
red
scarf
and
the
swinging
gun
and
the
slow
gait
no
other
than
bo
las
vegas
cowboy
admirer
then
helen
flashed
a
look
at
bo
which
look
gave
her
a
delicious
almost
irresistible
desire
to
laugh
that
young
lady
also
recognized
the
reluctant
individual
approaching
with
flushed
and
downcast
face
helen
recorded
her
first
experience
of
bo
utter
discomfiture
bo
turned
white
then
red
as
a
rose
say
my
niece
said
she
never
heard
of
the
name
carmichael
declared
al
severely
as
the
cowboy
halted
before
him
helen
knew
her
uncle
had
the
repute
of
dealing
hard
with
his
men
but
here
she
was
reassured
and
pleased
at
the
twinkle
in
his
eye
shore
boss
i
ca
help
thet
drawled
the
cowboy
it
good
old
texas
he
did
not
appear
shamefaced
now
but
just
as
cool
easy
and
lazy
as
the
day
helen
had
liked
his
warm
young
face
and
intent
gaze
texas
you
fellars
from
the
pan
handle
are
always
hollerin
texas
i
never
seen
thet
texans
had
any
one
else
beat
say
from
missouri
returned
al
testily
carmichael
maintained
a
discreet
silence
and
carefully
avoided
looking
at
the
girls
wal
reckon
we
all
call
you
las
vegas
anyway
continued
the
rancher
did
you
say
my
niece
sent
you
to
me
for
a
job
whereupon
carmichael
easy
manner
vanished
now
boss
shore
my
memory
pore
he
said
i
only
says
do
tell
me
thet
my
memory
not
replied
al
mimicking
the
drawl
what
you
said
was
thet
my
niece
would
speak
a
good
word
for
here
carmichael
stole
a
timid
glance
at
bo
the
result
of
which
was
to
render
him
utterly
crestfallen
not
improbably
he
had
taken
expression
to
mean
something
it
did
not
for
helen
read
it
as
a
mingling
of
consternation
and
fright
her
eyes
were
big
and
blazing
a
red
spot
was
growing
in
each
cheek
as
she
gathered
strength
from
his
confusion
well
did
you
demanded
al
from
the
glance
the
old
rancher
shot
from
the
cowboy
to
the
others
of
his
employ
it
seemed
to
helen
that
they
were
having
fun
at
expense
yes
sir
i
did
suddenly
replied
the
cowboy
all
right
here
my
niece
now
see
thet
she
speaks
the
good
carmichael
looked
at
bo
and
bo
looked
at
him
their
glances
were
strange
wondering
and
they
grew
shy
bo
dropped
hers
the
cowboy
apparently
forgot
what
had
been
demanded
of
him
helen
put
a
hand
on
the
old
rancher
arm
uncle
what
happened
was
my
fault
she
said
the
train
stopped
at
las
vegas
this
young
man
saw
us
at
the
open
window
he
must
have
guessed
we
were
lonely
homesick
girls
getting
lost
in
the
west
for
he
spoke
to
us
nice
and
friendly
he
knew
of
you
and
he
asked
in
what
i
took
for
fun
if
we
thought
you
would
give
him
a
job
and
i
replied
just
to
tease
bo
that
she
would
surely
speak
a
good
word
for
haw
haw
so
thet
it
replied
al
and
he
turned
to
bo
with
merry
eyes
wal
i
kept
this
here
las
vegas
carmichael
on
his
come
on
with
your
good
word
unless
you
want
to
see
him
lose
his
bo
did
not
grasp
her
uncle
bantering
because
she
was
seriously
gazing
at
the
cowboy
but
she
had
grasped
something
he
he
was
the
first
person
out
west
to
speak
kindly
to
us
she
said
facing
her
uncle
wal
thet
a
pretty
good
word
but
it
ai
enough
responded
al
subdued
laughter
came
from
the
listening
group
carmichael
shifted
from
side
to
side
he
he
looks
as
if
he
might
ride
a
horse
well
ventured
bo
best
hossman
i
ever
seen
agreed
al
heartily
and
and
shoot
added
bo
hopefully
bo
he
packs
thet
gun
low
like
jim
wilson
an
all
them
texas
reckon
thet
ai
no
good
then
i
vouch
for
him
said
bo
with
finality
thet
settles
auchincloss
turned
to
the
cowboy
las
vegas
a
stranger
to
us
but
you
welcome
to
a
place
in
the
outfit
an
i
hope
you
wo
never
disappoint
auchincloss
tone
passing
from
jest
to
earnest
betrayed
to
helen
the
old
rancher
need
of
new
and
true
men
and
hinted
of
trying
days
to
come
carmichael
stood
before
bo
sombrero
in
hand
rolling
it
round
and
round
manifestly
bursting
with
words
he
could
not
speak
and
the
girl
looked
very
young
and
sweet
with
her
flushed
face
and
shining
eyes
helen
saw
in
the
moment
more
than
that
little
of
confusion
miss
miss
rayner
i
shore
am
obliged
he
stammered
presently
you
very
welcome
she
replied
softly
i
i
got
on
the
next
train
he
added
when
he
said
that
bo
was
looking
straight
at
him
but
she
seemed
not
to
have
heard
what
your
name
suddenly
she
asked
i
heard
that
but
did
uncle
call
you
las
vegas
shore
but
it
was
my
fault
thet
outfit
saddled
it
on
me
right
off
they
do
know
no
better
shore
i
jest
wo
answer
to
thet
handle
now
miss
bo
my
real
name
is
i
simply
could
not
call
you
any
name
but
las
vegas
replied
bo
very
sweetly
but
beggin
your
pardon
i
i
do
like
thet
blustered
carmichael
people
often
get
called
names
they
do
like
she
said
with
deep
intent
the
cowboy
blushed
scarlet
helen
as
well
as
he
got
bo
inference
to
that
last
audacious
epithet
he
had
boldly
called
out
as
the
train
was
leaving
las
vegas
she
also
sensed
something
of
the
disaster
in
store
for
carmichael
just
then
the
embarrassed
young
man
was
saved
by
dale
call
to
the
girls
to
come
to
breakfast
that
meal
the
last
for
helen
in
paradise
park
gave
rise
to
a
strange
and
inexplicable
restraint
she
had
little
to
say
bo
was
in
the
highest
spirits
teasing
the
pets
joking
with
her
uncle
and
roy
and
even
poking
fun
at
dale
the
hunter
seemed
somewhat
somber
roy
was
his
usual
dry
genial
self
and
auchincloss
who
sat
near
by
was
an
interested
spectator
when
tom
put
in
an
appearance
lounging
with
his
feline
grace
into
the
camp
as
if
he
knew
he
was
a
privileged
pet
the
rancher
could
scarcely
contain
himself
dale
it
thet
damn
cougar
he
ejaculated
sure
that
he
ought
to
be
corralled
or
chained
i
no
use
for
cougars
protested
al
tom
is
as
tame
an
safe
as
a
wal
you
tell
thet
to
the
girls
if
you
like
but
not
me
i
an
old
hoss
i
uncle
al
tom
sleeps
curled
up
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
said
bo
aw
what
honest
injun
she
responded
well
is
it
so
helen
smilingly
nodded
her
corroboration
then
bo
called
tom
to
her
and
made
him
lie
with
his
head
on
his
stretched
paws
right
beside
her
and
beg
for
bits
to
eat
wal
i
never
have
believed
thet
exclaimed
al
shaking
his
big
head
dale
it
one
on
me
i
had
them
big
cats
foller
me
on
the
trails
through
the
woods
moonlight
an
dark
an
i
heard
let
out
thet
awful
cry
they

rose
with
beating
heart
and
tingling
ears
and
moved
away
out
of
hearing
she
had
listened
too
long
to
what
had
not
been
intended
for
her
ears
yet
she
could
not
be
sorry
she
walked
a
few
rods
along
the
brook
out
from
under
the
pines
and
standing
in
the
open
edge
of
the
park
she
felt
the
beautiful
scene
still
her
agitation
the
following
moments
then
were
the
happiest
she
had
spent
in
paradise
park
and
the
profoundest
of
her
whole
life
presently
her
uncle
called
her

the

pedro
bo
swept
a
saucy
glance
from
dale
to
her
sister
sure
she
have
ranger
just
offer
him
to
me
dale
stood
there
expectantly
holding
a
blanket
in
his
hand
ready
to
saddle
the
horse
carmichael
walked
around
ranger
with
that
appraising
eye
so
keen
in
cowboys
las
vegas
do

asked
bo

wal
if

carmichael

helen
as
she
advanced
to
lay
a
hand
on
the
horse
ranger
is
dale
smoothed
out
the
blanket
and
folding
it
he
threw
it
over
the
horse
and
then
with
one
powerful
swing
he
set
the
saddle
in
place
thank
you
very
much
for
him
said
helen
softly
you
welcome
an
i
sure
glad
responded
dale
and
then
after
a
few
deft
strong
pulls
at
the
straps
he
continued
there
he
ready
for
with
that
he
laid
an
arm
over
the
saddle
and
faced
helen
as
she
stood
patting
and
smoothing
ranger
helen
strong
and
calm
now
in
feminine
possession
of
her
secret
and
his
as
well
as
her
composure
looked
frankly
and
steadily
at
dale
he
seemed
composed
too
yet
the
bronze
of
his
fine
face
was
a
trifle
pale
but
i
ca
thank
you
i
never
be
able
to
repay
you
for
your
service
to
me
and
my
sister
said

for
are

down
to
pine
with
us
but
you
will
come
soon
not
very
soon
i
reckon
he
replied
and
averted
his
gaze
when
hardly
before
spring
that
is
a
long
time
wo
you
come
to
see
me
sooner
than
that
if
i
can
get
down
to
you
the
first
friend
i
made
in
the
west
said
helen
earnestly
you

many
more

reckon

called
the
man
of
the
i
never

the

will
you
remember
will
you
promise
to
come
to
pine
i
thank
you
all
well
then
my
friend
he
said
clasping
her
hand
his
glance
was
clear
warm
beautiful
yet
it
was
sad
auchincloss
hearty
voice
broke
the
spell
then
helen
saw
that
the
others
were
mounted
bo
had
ridden
up
close
her
face
was
earnest
and
happy
and
grieved
all
at
once
as
she
bade
to
dale
the
were
hobbling
along
toward
the
green
slope
helen
was
the
last
to
mount
but
roy
was
the
last
to
leave
the
hunter
pedro
came
reluctantly
it
was
a
merry
singing
train
which
climbed
that
brown
odorous
trail
under
the
dark
spruces
helen
assuredly
was
happy
yet
a
pang
abided
in
her
breast
she
remembered
that
up
the
slope
there
was
a
turn
in
the
trail
where
it
came
out
upon
an
open
bluff
the
time
seemed
long
but
at
last
she
got
there
and
she
checked
ranger
so
as
to
have
a
moment
gaze
down
into
the
park
it
yawned
there
a
and
gulf
asleep
under
a
westering
sun
exquisite
wild
lonesome
then
she
saw
dale
standing
in
the
open
space
between
the
pines
and
the
spruces
he
waved
to
her
and
she
returned
the
salute
roy
caught
up
with
her
then
and
halted
his
horse
he
waved
his
sombrero
to
dale
and
let
out
a
piercing
yell
that
awoke
the
sleeping
echoes
splitting
strangely
from
cliff
to
cliff
shore
milt
never
knowed
what
it
was
to
be
lonesome
said
roy
as
if
thinking
aloud
but
he
know
ranger
stepped
out
of
his
own
accord
and
turning
off
the
ledge
entered
the
spruce
forest
helen
lost
sight
of
paradise
park
for
hours
then
she
rode
along
a
shady
fragrant
trail
seeing
the
beauty
of
color
and
wildness
hearing
the
murmur
and
rush
and
roar
of
water
but
all
the
while
her
mind
revolved
the
sweet
and
momentous
realization
which
had
thrilled
her
that
the
hunter
this
strange
man
of
the
forest
so
deeply
versed
in
nature
and
so
unfamiliar
with
emotion
aloof
and
simple
and
strong
like
the
elements
which
had
developed
him
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
and
did
not
know
it
chapter
xv
dale
stood
with
face
and
arm
upraised
and
he
watched
helen
ride
off
the
ledge
to
disappear
in
the
forest
that
vast
spruce
slope
seemed
to
have
swallowed
her
she
was
gone
slowly
dale
lowered
his
arm
with
gesture
expressive
of
a
strange
finality
an
eloquent
despair
of
which
he
was
unconscious
he
turned
to
the
park
to
his
camp
and
the
many
duties
of
a
hunter
the
park
did
not
seem
the
same
nor
his
home
nor
his
work
i
reckon
this
feelin
natural
he
soliloquized
resignedly
but
sure
queer
for
me
that
what
comes
of
makin
friends
nell
an
bo
now
they
made
a
difference
an
a
difference
i
never
knew
he
calculated
that
this
difference
had
been
simply
one
of
responsibility
and
then
the
charm
and
liveliness
of
the
companionship
of
girls
and
finally
friendship
these
would
pass
now
that
the
causes
were
removed
before
he
had
worked
an
hour
around
camp
he
realized
a
change
had
come
but
it
was
not
the
one
anticipated
always
before
he
had
put
his
mind
on
his
tasks
whatever
they
might
be
now
he
worked
while
his
thoughts
were
strangely
involved
the
little
bear
cub
whined
at
his
heels
the
tame
deer
seemed
to
regard
him
with
deep
questioning
eyes
the
big
cougar
padded
softly
here
and
there
as
if
searching
for
something
you
all
miss
them
now
i
reckon
said
dale
well
they
gone
you
have
to
get
along
with
some
vague
approach
to
irritation
with
his
pets
surprised
him
presently
he
grew
both
irritated
and
surprised
with
himself
a
state
of
mind
totally
unfamiliar
several
times
as
old
habit
brought
momentary
abstraction
he
found
himself
suddenly
looking
around
for
helen
and
bo
and
each
time
the
shock
grew
stronger
they
were
gone
but
their
presence
lingered
after
his
camp
chores
were
completed
he
went
over
to
pull
down
the
which
the
girls
had
utilized
as
a
tent
the
spruce
boughs
had
dried
out
brown
and
sear
the
wind
had
blown
the
roof
awry
the
sides
were
leaning
in
as
there
was
now
no
further
use
for
this
little
habitation
he
might
better
pull
it
down
dale
did
not
acknowledge
that
his
gaze
had
involuntarily
wandered
toward
it
many
times
therefore
he
strode
over
with
the
intention
of
destroying
it
for
the
first
time
since
roy
and
he
had
built
the
he
stepped
inside
nothing
was
more
certain
than
the
fact
that
he
experienced
a
strange
sensation
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
him
the
blankets
lay
there
on
the
spruce
boughs
disarranged
and
thrown
back
by
hurried
hands
yet
still
holding
something
of
round
folds
where
the
slender
forms
had
nestled
a
black
scarf
often
worn
by
bo
lay
covering
the
pillow
of
a
red
ribbon
that
helen
had
worn
on
her
hair
hung
from
a
twig
these
articles
were
all
that
had
been
forgotten
dale
gazed
at
them
attentively
then
at
the
blankets
and
all
around
the
fragrant
little
shelter
and
he
stepped
outside
with
an
uncomfortable
knowledge
that
he
could
not
destroy
the
place
where
helen
and
bo
had
spent
so
many
hours
whereupon
in
studious
mood
dale
took
up
his
rifle
and
strode
out
to
hunt
his
winter
supply
of
venison
had
not
yet
been
laid
in
action
suited
his
mood
he
climbed
far
and
passed
by
many
a
watching
buck
to
slay
which
seemed
murder
at
last
he
jumped
one
that
was
wild
and
bounded
away
this
he
shot
and
set
himself
a
herculean
task
in
packing
the
whole
carcass
back
to
camp
burdened
thus
he
staggered
under
the
trees
sweating
freely
many
times
laboring
for
breath
aching
with
toil
until
at
last
he
had
reached
camp
there
he
slid
the
deer
carcass
off
his
shoulders
and
standing
over
it
he
gazed
down
while
his
breast
labored
it
was
one
of
the
finest
young
bucks
he
had
ever
seen
but
neither
in
stalking
it
nor
making
a
wonderful
shot
nor
in
packing
home
a
weight
that
would
have
burdened
two
men
nor
in
gazing
down
at
his
beautiful
quarry
did
dale
experience
any
of
the
old
joy
of
the
hunter
i
a
little
off
my
feed
he
mused
as
he
wiped
sweat
from
his
heated
face
maybe
a
little
dotty
as
i
called
al
but
that
whatever
his
state
it
did
not
pass
as
of
old
after
a
long
day
hunt
he
reclined
beside
the
and
watched
the
golden
sunset
glows
change
on
the
ramparts
as
of
old
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
soft
furry
head
of
the
pet
cougar
as
of
old
he
watched
the
gold
change
to
red
and
then
to
dark
and
twilight
fall
like
a
blanket
as
of
old
he
listened
to
the
dreamy
lulling
murmur
of
the
water
fall
the
old
familiar
beauty
wildness
silence
and
loneliness
were
there
but
the
old
content
seemed
strangely
gone
soberly
he
confessed
then
that
he
missed
the
happy
company
of
the
girls
he
did
not
distinguish
helen
from
bo
in
his
slow
introspection
when
he
sought
his
bed
he
did
not
at
once
fall
to
sleep
always
after
a
few
moments
of
wakefulness
while
the
silence
settled
down
or
the
wind
moaned
through
the
pines
he
had
fallen
asleep
this
night
he
found
different
though
he
was
tired
sleep
would
not
soon
come
the
wilderness
the
mountains
the
park
the
camp
all
seemed
to
have
lost
something
even
the
darkness
seemed
empty
and
when
at
length
dale
fell
asleep
it
was
to
be
troubled
by
restless
dreams
up
with
the
dawn
he
went
at
the
his
tasks
with
the
springy
stride
of
the
at
the
end
of
that
strenuous
day
which
was
singularly
full
of
the
old
excitement
and
action
and
danger
and
of
new
observations
he
was
bound
to
confess
that
no
longer
did
the
chase
suffice
for
him
many
times
on
the
heights
that
day
with
the
wind
keen
in
his
face
and
the
vast
green
billows
of
spruce
below
him
he
had
found
that
he
was
gazing
without
seeing
halting
without
object
dreaming
as
he
had
never
dreamed
before
once
when
a
magnificent
elk
came
out
upon
a
rocky
ridge
and
whistling
a
challenge
to
invisible
rivals
stood
there
a
target
to
stir
any
hunter
pulse
dale
did
not
even
raise
his
rifle
into
his
ear
just
then
rang
helen
voice
milt
dale
you
are
no
indian
giving
yourself
to
a
hunter
wildlife
is
selfish
it
is
wrong
you
love
this
lonely
life
but
it
is
not
work
work
that
does
not
help
others
is
not
a
real
man
from
that
moment
conscience
tormented
him
it
was
not
what
he
loved
but
what
he
ought
to
do
that
counted
in
the
sum
of
good
achieved
in
the
world
old
al
auchincloss
had
been
right
dale
was
wasting
strength
and
intelligence
that
should
go
to
do
his
share
in
the
development
of
the
west
now
that
he
had
reached
maturity
if
through
his
knowledge
of
nature
law
he
had
come
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
strife
of
men
for
existence
for
place
for
possession
and
to
hold
them
in
contempt
that
was
no
reason
why
he
should
keep
himself
aloof
from
them
from
some
work
that
was
needed
in
an
incomprehensible
world
dale
did
not
hate
work
but
he
loved
freedom
to
be
alone
to
live
with
nature
to
feel
the
elements
to
labor
and
dream
and
idle
and
climb
and
sleep
unhampered
by
duty
by
worry
by
restriction
by
the
petty
interests
of
men
this
had
always
been
his
ideal
of
living
cowboys
riders
farmers
these
toiled
on
from
one
place
and
one
job
to
another
for
the
little
money
doled
out
to
them
nothing
beautiful
nothing
significant
had
ever
existed
in
that
for
him
he
had
worked
as
a
boy
at
every
kind
of
and
of
all
that
humdrum
waste
of
effort
he
had
liked
sawing
wood
best
once
he
had
quit
a
job
of
branding
cattle
because
the
smell
of
burning
hide
the
bawl
of
the
terrified
calf
had
sickened
him
if
men
were
honest
there
would
be
no
need
to
scar
cattle
he
had
never
in
the
least
desired
to
own
land
and
droves
of
stock
and
make
deals
with
ranchmen
deals
advantageous
to
himself
why
should
a
man
want
to
make
a
deal
or
trade
a
horse
or
do
a
piece
of
work
to
another
man
disadvantage
was
the
first
law
of
life
but
as
the
plants
and
trees
and
birds
and
beasts
interpreted
that
law
merciless
and
inevitable
as
they
were
they
had
neither
greed
nor
dishonesty
they
lived
by
the
grand
rule
of
what
was
best
for
the
greatest
number
but
dale
philosophy
cold
and
clear
and
inevitable
like
nature
itself
began
to
be
pierced
by
the
human
appeal
in
helen
rayner
words
what
did
she
mean
not
that
he
should
lose
his
love
of
the
wilderness
but
that
he
realize
himself
many
chance
words
of
that
girl
had
depth
he
was
young
strong
intelligent
free
from
taint
of
disease
or
the
fever
of
drink
he
could
do
something
for
others
who
if
that
mattered
there
for
instance
was
poor
old
cass
aged
and
lame
now
there
was
al
auchincloss
dying
in
his
boots
afraid
of
enemies
and
wistful
for
his
blood
and
his
property
to
receive
the
fruit
of
his
labors
there
were
the
two
girls
helen
and
bo
new
and
strange
to
the
west
about
to
be
confronted
by
a
big
problem
of
ranch
life
and
rival
interests
dale
thought
of
still
more
people
in
the
little
village
of
pine
of
others
who
had
failed
whose
lives
were
hard
who
could
have
been
made
happier
by
kindness
and
assistance
what
then
was
the
duty
of
milt
dale
to
himself
because
men
preyed
on
one
another
and
on
the
weak
should
he
turn
his
back
upon
a
civilization
or
should
he
grow
like
them
clear
as
a
bell
came
the
answer
that
his
duty
was
to
do
neither
and
then
he
saw
how
the
little
village
of
pine
as
well
as
the
whole
world
needed
men
like
him
he
had
gone
to
nature
to
the
forest
to
the
wilderness
for
his
development
and
all
the
judgments
and
efforts
of
his
future
would
be
a
result
of
that
education
thus
dale
lying
in
the
darkness
and
silence
of
his
lonely
park
arrived
at
a
conclusion
that
he
divined
was
but
the
beginning
of
a
struggle
it
took
long
introspection
to
determine
the
exact
nature
of
that
struggle
but
at
length
it
evolved
into
the
paradox
that
helen
rayner
had
opened
his
eyes
to
his
duty
as
a
man
that
he
accepted
it
yet
found
a
strange
obstacle
in
the
perplexing
tumultuous
sweet
fear
of
ever
going
near
her
again
suddenly
then
all
his
thought
revolved
around
the
girl
and
thrown
off
his
balance
he
weltered
in
a
wilderness
of
unfamiliar
strange
ideas
when
he
awoke
next
day
the
fight
was
on
in
earnest
in
his
sleep
his
mind
had
been
active
the
idea
that
greeted
him
beautiful
as
the
sunrise
flashed
in
memory
of
auchincloss
significant
words
take
your
chance
with
the
girl
the
old
rancher
was
in
his
dotage
he
hinted
of
things
beyond
the
range
of
possibility
that
idea
of
a
chance
for
dale
remained
before
his
consciousness
only
an
instant
stars
were
unattainable
life
could
not
be
fathomed
the
secret
of
nature
did
not
abide
alone
on
the
earth
these
theories
were
not
any
more
impossible
of
proving
than
that
helen
rayner
might
be
for
him
nevertheless
her
strange
coming
into
his
life
had
played
havoc
the
extent
of
which
he
had
only
begun
to
realize
for
a
month
he
tramped
through
the
forest
it
was
october
a
still
golden
fulfilling
season
of
the
year
and
everywhere
in
the
vast
dark
green
a
glorious
blaze
of
oak
and
aspen
made
beautiful
contrast
he
carried
his
rifle
but
he
never
used
it
he
would
climb
miles
and
go
this
way
and
that
with
no
object
in
view
yet
his
eye
and
ear
had
never
been
keener
hours
he
would
spend
on
a
promontory
watching
the
distance
where
the
golden
patches
of
aspen
shone
bright
out
of
mountain
slopes
he
loved
to
fling
himself
down
in
an
at
the
edge
of
a
senaca
and
there
lie
in
that
radiance
like
a
veil
of
gold
and
purple
and
red
with
the
white
striping
the
shade
always
whether
there
were
breeze
or
not
the
quivered
ceaselessly
wonderfully
like
his
pulses
beyond
his
control
often
he
reclined
against
a
mossy
rock
beside
a
mountain
stream
to
listen
to
watch
to
feel
all
that
was
there
while
his
mind
held
a
haunting
vision
of
a
girl
on
the
lonely
heights
like
an
eagle
he
sat
gazing
down
into
paradise
park
that
was
more
and
more
beautiful
but
would
never
again
be
the
same
never
fill
him
with
content
never
be
all
and
all
to
him
late
in
october
the
first
snow
fell
it
melted
at
once
on
the
south
side
of
the
park
but
the
north
slopes
and
the
rims
and
domes
above
stayed
white
dale
had
worked
quick
and
hard
at
curing
and
storing
his
winter
supply
of
food
and
now
he
spent
days
chopping
and
splitting
wood
to
burn
during
the
months
he
would
be
he
watched
for
the
and
welcomed
them
when
they
came
once
there
lay
ten
feet
of
snow
on
the
trails
he
would
be
until
spring
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
down
to
pine
and
perhaps
during
the
long
winter
he
would
be
cured
of
this
strange
nameless
disorder
of
his
feelings
november
brought
storms
up
on
the
peaks
flurries
of
snow
fell
in
the
park
every
day
but
the
sunny
south
side
where
dale
camp
lay
retained
its
autumnal
color
and
warmth
not
till
late
in
winter
did
the
snow
creep
over
this
secluded
nook
the
morning
came
at
last
piercingly
keen
and
bright
when
dale
saw
that
the
heights
were
impassable
the
realization
brought
him
a
poignant
regret
he
had
not
guessed
how
he
had
wanted
to
see
helen
rayner
again
until
it
was
too
late
that
opened
his
eyes
a
raging
frenzy
of
action
followed
in
which
he
only
tired
himself
physically
without
helping
himself
spiritually
it
was
sunset
when
he
faced
the
west
looking
up
at
the
pink
and
the
fringe
of
spruce
and
in
that
moment
he
found
the
truth
i
love
that
girl
i
love
that
girl
he
spoke
aloud
to
the
distant
white
peaks
to
the
winds
to
the
loneliness
and
silence
of
his
prison
to
the
great
pines
and
to
the
murmuring
stream
and
to
his
faithful
pets
it
was
his
tragic
confession
of
weakness
of
amazing
truth
of
hopeless
position
of
pitiful
excuse
for
the
transformation
wrought
in
him
dale
struggle
ended
there
when
he
faced
his
soul
to
understand
himself
was
to
be
released
from
strain
worry
ceaseless
importuning
doubt
and
wonder
and
fear
but
the
fever
of
unrest
of
uncertainty
had
been
nothing
compared
to
a
sudden
upflashing
torment
of
love
with
somber
deliberation
he
set
about
the
tasks
needful
and
others
that
he
might
make
his
and
meals
the
care
of
his
pets
and
horses
the
mending
of
saddles
and
the
curing
of
buckskin
for
moccasins
and
so
his
days
were
not
idle
but
all
this
work
was
habit
for
him
and
needed
no
application
of
mind
and
dale
like
some
men
of
lonely
wilderness
lives
who
did
not
retrograde
toward
the
savage
was
a
thinker
love
made
him
a
sufferer
the
surprise
and
shame
of
his
unconscious
surrender
the
certain
hopelessness
of
it
the
long
years
of
communion
with
all
that
was
wild
lonely
and
beautiful
the
wonderfully
developed
insight
into
secrets
and
the
revelation
that
he
was
no
omniscient
being
exempt
from
the
ruthless
ordinary
destiny
of
man
all
these
showed
him
the
strength
of
his
manhood
and
of
his
passion
and
that
the
life
he
had
chosen
was
of
all
lives
the
one
calculated
to
make
love
sad
and
terrible
helen
rayner
haunted
him
in
the
sunlight
there
was
not
a
place
around
camp
which
did
not
picture
her
lithe
vigorous
body
her
dark
thoughtful
eyes
her
eloquent
resolute
lips
and
the
smile
that
was
so
sweet
and
strong
at
night
she
was
there
like
a
slender
specter
pacing
beside
him
under
the
moaning
pines
every
held
in
its
heart
the
glowing
white
radiance
of
her
spirit
nature
had
taught
dale
to
love
solitude
and
silence
but
love
itself
taught
him
their
meaning
solitude
had
been
created
for
the
eagle
on
his
crag
for
the
blasted
mountain
fir
lonely
and
gnarled
on
its
peak
for
the
elk
and
the
wolf
but
it
had
not
been
intended
for
man
and
to
live
always
in
the
silence
of
wild
places
was
to
become
obsessed
with
self
to
think
and
dream
to
be
happy
which
state
however
pursued
by
man
was
not
good
for
him
man
must
be
given
imperious
longings
for
the
unattainable
it
needed
then
only
the
memory
of
an
unattainable
woman
to
render
solitude
passionately
desired
by
a
man
yet
almost
unendurable
dale
was
alone
with
his
secret
and
every
pine
everything
in
that
park
saw
him
shaken
and
undone
in
the
dark
pitchy
deadness
of
night
when
there
was
no
wind
and
the
cold
on
the
peaks
had
frozen
the
waterfall
then
the
silence
seemed
insupportable
many
hours
that
should
have
been
given
to
slumber
were
paced
out
under
the
cold
white
pitiless
stars
under
the
lonely
pines
dale
memory
betrayed
him
mocked
his
restraint
cheated
him
of
any
peace
and
his
imagination
sharpened
by
love
created
pictures
fancies
feelings
that
drove
him
frantic
he
thought
of
helen
rayner
strong
shapely
brown
hand
in
a
thousand
different
actions
it
haunted
him
how
quick
and
deft
in
tasks
how
graceful
and
swift
as
she
plaited
her
dark
hair
how
tender
and
skilful
in
its
ministration
when
one
of
his
pets
had
been
injured
how
eloquent
when
pressed
tight
against
her
breast
in
a
moment
of
fear
on
the
dangerous
heights
how
expressive
of
unutterable
things
when
laid
on
his
arm
dale
saw
that
beautiful
hand
slowly
creep
up
his
arm
across
his
shoulder
and
slide
round
his
neck
to
clasp
there
he
was
powerless
to
inhibit
the
picture
and
what
he
felt
then
was
boundless
unutterable
no
woman
had
ever
yet
so
much
as
clasped
his
hand
and
heretofore
no
such
imaginings
had
ever
crossed
his
mind
yet
deep
in
him
somewhere
hidden
had
been
this
waiting
sweet
and
imperious
need
in
the
bright
day
he
appeared
to
ward
off
such
fancies
but
at
night
he
was
helpless
and
every
fancy
left
him
weaker
wilder
when
at
the
culmination
of
this
phase
of
his
passion
dale
who
had
never
known
the
touch
of
a
woman
lips
suddenly
yielded
to
the
illusion
of
helen
rayner
kisses
he
found
himself
quite
mad
filled
with
rapture
and
despair
loving
her
as
he
hated
himself
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
experienced
all
these
terrible
feelings
in
some
former
life
and
had
forgotten
them
in
this
life
he
had
no
right
to
think
of
her
but
he
could
not
resist
it
imagining
the
sweet
surrender
of
her
lips
was
a
sacrilege
yet
here
in
spite
of
will
and
honor
and
shame
he
was
lost
dale
at
length
was
vanquished
and
he
ceased
to
rail
at
himself
or
restrain
his
fancies
he
became
a
dreamy
gazer
like
many
another
lonely
man
separated
by
chance
or
error
from
what
the
heart
hungered
most
for
but
this
great
experience
when
all
its
significance
had
clarified
in
his
mind
immeasurably
broadened
his
understanding
of
the
principles
of
nature
applied
to
life
love
had
been
in
him
stronger
than
in
most
men
because
of
his
keen
vigorous
lonely
years
in
the
forest
where
health
of
mind
and
body
were
intensified
and
preserved
how
simple
how
natural
how
inevitable
he
might
have
loved
any
girl
like
a
tree
shooting
its
branches
and
leaves
its
whole
entity
toward
the
sunlight
so
had
he
grown
toward
a
woman
love
why
because
the
thing
he
revered
in
nature
the
spirit
the
universal
the
life
that
was
god
had
created
at
his
birth
or
before
his
birth
the
three
tremendous
instincts
of
nature
to
fight
for
life
to
feed
himself
to
reproduce
his
kind
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
but
oh
the
mystery
the
beauty
the
torment
and
the
terror
of
this
third
instinct
this
hunger
for
the
sweetness
and
the
glory
of
a
woman
love
chapter
xvi
helen
rayner
dropped
her
knitting
into
her
lap
and
sat
pensively
gazing
out
of
the
window
over
the
bare
yellow
ranges
of
her
uncle
ranch
the
winter
day
was
bright
but
steely
and
the
wind
that
whipped
down
from
the
mountains
had
a
keen
frosty
edge
a
scant
snow
lay
in
protected
places
cattle
stood
bunched
in
the
lee
of
ridges
low
sheets
of
dust
scurried
across
the
flats
the
big
of
the
was
warm
and
comfortable
with
its
red
adobe
walls
its
huge
stone
fireplace
where
cedar
logs
blazed
and
its
blankets
bo
rayner
sat
before
the
fire
curled
up
in
an
armchair
absorbed
in
a
book
on
the
floor
lay
the
hound
pedro
his
racy
fine
head
stretched
toward
the
warmth
did
uncle
call
asked
helen
with
a
start
out
of
her
reverie
i
did
hear
him
replied
bo
helen
rose
to
tiptoe
across
the
floor
and
softly
parting
some
curtains
she
looked
into
the
room
where
her
uncle
lay
he
was
asleep
sometimes
he
called
out
in
his
slumbers
for
weeks
now
he
had
been
confined
to
his
bed
slowly
growing
weaker
with
a
sigh
helen
returned
to
her
and
took
up
her
work
bo
the
sun
is
bright
she
said
the
days
are
growing
longer
i
so
nell
you
always
wishing
time
away
for
me
it
passes
quickly
enough
replied
the
sister
but
i
love
spring
and
summer
and
fall
and
i
guess
i
hate
winter
returned
helen
thoughtfully
the
yellow
ranges
rolled
away
up
to
the
black
ridges
and
they
in
turn
swept
up
to
the
cold
white
mountains
helen
gaze
seemed
to
go
beyond
that
snowy
barrier
and
bo
keen
eyes
studied
her
sister
earnest
sad
face
nell
do
you
ever
think
of
dale
she
queried
suddenly
the
question
startled
helen
a
slow
blush
suffused
neck
and
cheek
of
course
she
replied
as
if
surprised
that
bo
should
ask
such
a
thing
i
i
should
have
asked
that
said
bo
softly
and
then
bent
again
over
her
book
helen
gazed
tenderly
at
that
bright
bowed
head
in
this
eventful
busy
winter
during
which
the
management
of
the
ranch
had
devolved
wholly
upon
helen
the
little
sister
had
grown
away
from
her
bo
had
insisted
upon
her
own
free
will
and
she
had
followed
it
to
the
amusement
of
her
uncle
to
the
concern
of
helen
to
the
dismay
and
bewilderment
of
the
faithful
mexican
housekeeper
and
to
the
undoing
of
all
the
young
men
on
the
ranch
helen
had
always
been
hoping
and
waiting
for
a
favorable
hour
in
which
she
might
find
this
wilful
sister
once
more
susceptible
to
wise
and
loving
influence
but
while
she
hesitated
to
speak
slow
footsteps
and
a
jingle
of
spurs
sounded
without
and
then
came
a
timid
knock
bo
looked
up
brightly
and
ran
to
open
the
door
oh
it
only
you
she
uttered
in
withering
scorn
to
the
one
who
knocked
helen
thought
she
could
guess
who
that
was
how
are
asked
a
drawling
voice
well
mister
carmichael
if
that
interests
you
i
quite
ill
replied
bo
freezingly
ill
aw
no
now
it
a
fact
if
i
do
die
right
off
i
have
to
be
taken
back
to
missouri
said
bo
casually
are
you
goin
to
ask
me
in
queried
carmichael
bluntly
cold
an
i
got
somethin
to
say
to
to
me
well
you
not
backward
i
declare
retorted
bo
miss
rayner
i
reckon
it
be
strange
to
you
findin
out
i
come
to
see
indeed
no
but
what
was
strange
was
the
deluded
idea
i
had
that
you
meant
to
apologize
to
me
like
a
gentleman
come
in
carmichael
my
sister
is
the
door
closed
as
helen
turned
round
carmichael
stood
just
inside
with
his
sombrero
in
hand
and
as
he
gazed
at
bo
his
lean
face
seemed
hard
in
the
few
months
since
autumn
he
had
changed
aged
it
seemed
and
the
once
young
frank
alert
and
careless
cowboy
traits
had
merged
into
the
making
of
a
man
helen
knew
just
how
much
of
a
man
he
really
was
he
had
been
her
mainstay
during
all
the
complex
working
of
the
ranch
that
had
fallen
upon
her
shoulders
wal
i
reckon
you
was
deluded
all
right
if
you
thought
i
crawl
like
them
other
lovers
of
yours
he
said
with
cool
deliberation
bo
turned
pale
and
her
eyes
fairly
blazed
yet
even
in
what
must
have
been
her
fury
helen
saw
amaze
and
pain
other
lovers
i
think
the
biggest
delusion
here
is
the
way
you
flatter
yourself
replied
bo
stingingly
me
flatter
myself
nope
you
do
savvy
me
i
shore
hatin
myself
these
small
wonder
i
certainly
hate
you
with
all
my
heart
at
this
retort
the
cowboy
dropped
his
head
and
did
not
see
bo
flaunt
herself
out
of
the
room
but
he
heard
the
door
close
and
then
slowly
came
toward
helen
cheer
up
las
vegas
said
helen
smiling
bo
miss
nell
i
just
like
a
dog
the
meaner
she
treats
me
the
more
i
love
her
he
replied
dejectedly
to
helen
first
instinct
of
liking
for
this
cowboy
there
had
been
added
admiration
respect
and
a
growing
appreciation
of
strong
faithful
developing
character
carmichael
face
and
hands
were
red
and
chapped
from
winter
winds
the
leather
of
belt
and
boots
was
all
worn
shiny
and
thin
little
streaks
of
dust
fell
from
him
as
he
breathed
heavily
he
no
longer
looked
the
dashing
cowboy
ready
for
a
dance
or
lark
or
fight
how
in
the
world
did
you
offend
her
so
asked
helen
bo
is
furious
i
never
saw
her
so
angry
as
miss
nell
it
was
jest
this
way
began
carmichael
shore
bo
knowed
i
was
in
love
with
her
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
an
she
would
say
yes
or
no
an
mean
as
it
sounds
she
never
run
away
from
it
shore
we
had
some
quarrels
two
of
them
bad
an
this
last
the
bo
told
me
about
one
quarrel
said
helen
it
was
because
you
drank
that
shore
it
was
she
took
one
of
her
cold
spells
an
i
jest
got
but
that
was
wrong
protested
helen
i
ai
so
shore
you
see
i
used
to
get
drunk
often
before
i
come
here
an
i
been
drunk
only
once
back
at
las
vegas
the
outfit
would
never
believe
thet
wal
i
promised
bo
i
would
do
it
again
an
kept
my
that
is
fine
of
you
but
tell
me
why
is
she
angry
now
bo
makes
up
to
all
the
fellars
confessed
carmichael
hanging
his
head
i
took
her
to
the
dance
last
week
over
in
the
the
first
time
she
gone
anywhere
with
me
i
shore
was
proud
but
thet
dance
was
hell
bo
carried
on
somethin
turrible
an
i
tell
me
what
did
she
do
demanded
helen
anxiously
i
responsible
for
her
i
got
to
see
that
she
aw
i
ai
sayin
she
did
behave
like
a
lady
replied
carmichael
it
was
she
wal
all
them
fellars
are
fools
over
her
an
bo
true
to
my
dear
boy
is
bo
engaged
to
you
lord
if
she
only
was
he
sighed
then
how
can
you
say
she
was
true
to
you
be
i
reckon
now
miss
nell
thet
no
one
can
be
in
love
an
act
reasonable
rejoined
the
cowboy
i
do
know
how
to
explain
but
the
fact
is
i
feel
thet
bo
has
played
the
the
devil
with
me
an
all
the
other
you
mean
she
has
flirted
i
las
vegas
i
afraid
you
right
said
helen
with
growing
apprehension
go
on
tell
me
what
wal
thet
turner
boy
who
rides
for
beasley
he
was
hot
after
bo
returned
carmichael
and
he
spoke
as
if
memory
hurt
him
reckon
no
use
for
turner
he
a
strappin
big
calculated
to
win
the
girls
he
brags
thet
he
can
an
i
reckon
right
wal
he
was
always
hangin
round
bo
an
he
stole
one
of
my
dances
with
bo
i
only
had
three
an
he
comes
up
to
say
this
one
was
his
bo
very
innocent
oh
she
a
cute
one
she
says
mister
turner
is
it
really
yours
an
she
looked
so
full
of
joy
thet
when
he
says
to
me
us
friend
carmichael
i
sat
there
like
a
locoed
jackass
an
let
them
go
but
i
was
mad
at
thet
he
was
a
better
dancer
than
me
an
i
wanted
her
to
have
a
good
time
what
started
the
hell
was
i
seen
him
put
his
arm
round
her
when
it
was
just
time
accordin
to
the
dance
an
bo
she
did
break
any
records
away
from
him
she
pushed
him
away
after
a
little
after
i
near
died
wal
on
the
way
home
i
had
to
tell
her
i
shore
did
an
she
said
what
i
love
to
forget
then
then
miss
nell
i
grabbed
her
it
was
outside
here
by
the
porch
an
all
bright
moonlight
i
grabbed
her
an
hugged
kissed
her
good
when
i
let
her
go
i
says
sorta
brave
but
i
was
plumb
scared
i
says
are
you
goin
to
marry
me
now
he
concluded
with
a
gulp
and
looked
at
helen
with
woe
in
his
eyes
oh
what
did
bo
do
breathlessly
queried
helen
she
slapped
me
he
replied
an
then
she
says
i
did
like
you
best
but
now
i
hate
you
an
she
slammed
the
door
in
my
i
think
you
made
a
great
mistake
said
helen
gravely
wal
if
i
thought
so
i
beg
her
forgiveness
but
i
reckon
i
do
what
more
i
feel
better
than
before
i
only
a
cowboy
an
never
was
much
good
till
i
met
her
then
i
braced
i
got
to
havin
hopes
books
an
you
know
how
i
been
lookin
into
this
ranchin
game
i
stopped
drinkin
an
saved
my
money
wal
she
knows
all
thet
once
she
said
she
was
proud
of
me
but
it
did
seem
to
count
big
with
her
an
if
it
ca
count
big
i
do
want
it
to
count
at
all
i
reckon
the
madder
bo
is
at
me
the
more
chance
i
got
she
knows
i
love
her
thet
i
die
for
her
thet
i
a
changed
man
an
she
knows
i
never
before
thought
of
darin
to
touch
her
hand
an
she
knows
she
flirted
with
she
only
a
child
replied
helen
and
all
this
change
the
west
the
wildness
and
you
boys
making
much
of
her
why
it
turned
her
head
but
bo
will
come
out
of
it
true
blue
she
is
good
loving
her
heart
is
i
reckon
i
know
an
my
faith
ca
be
shook
rejoined
carmichael
simply
but
she
ought
to
believe
thet
she
make
bad
blood
out
here
the
west
is
the
west
any
kind
of
girls
are
scarce
an
one
like
bo
lord
we
cowboys
never
seen
none
to
compare
with
her
she
make
bad
blood
an
some
of
it
will
be
uncle
al
encourages
her
said
helen
apprehensively
it
tickles
him
to
hear
how
the
boys
are
after
her
oh
she
does
tell
him
but
he
hears
and
i
who
must
stand
in
mother
place
to
her
what
can
i
do
miss
nell
are
you
on
my
side
asked
the
cowboy
wistfully
he
was
strong
and
elemental
caught
in
the
toils
of
some
power
beyond
him
yesterday
helen
might
have
hesitated
at
that
question
but
carmichael
brought
some
proven
quality
of
loyalty
some
strange
depth
of
rugged
sincerity
as
if
she
had
learned
his
future
worth
yes
i
am
helen
replied
earnestly
and
she
offered
her
hand
wal
then
it
shore
turn
out
happy
he
said
squeezing
her
hand
his
smile
was
grateful
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
of
the
victory
he
hinted
at
some
of
his
ruddy
color
had
gone
an
now
i
want
to
tell
you
why
i
he
had
lowered
his
voice
is
al
asleep
he
whispered
yes
replied
helen
he
was
a
little
while
reckon
i
better
shut
his
helen
watched
the
cowboy
glide
across
the
room
and
carefully
close
the
door
then
return
to
her
with
intent
eyes
she
sensed
events
in
his
look
and
she
divined
suddenly
that
he
must
feel
as
if
he
were
her
brother
shore
i
the
one
thet
fetches
all
the
bad
news
to
you
he
said
regretfully
helen
caught
her
breath
there
had
indeed
been
many
little
calamities
to
mar
her
management
of
the
ranch
loss
of
cattle
horses
sheep
the
desertion
of
herders
to
beasley
failure
of
freighters
to
arrive
when
most
needed
fights
among
the
cowboys
and
disagreements
over
deals
your
uncle
al
makes
a
heap
of
this
here
jeff
mulvey
asserted
carmichael
yes
indeed
uncle
absolutely
relies
on
jeff
replied
helen
wal
i
hate
to
tell
you
miss
nell
said
the
cowboy
bitterly
thet
mulvey
ai
the
man
he
oh
what
do
you
mean
when
your
uncle
dies
mulvey
is
goin
over
to
beasley
an
he
goin
to
take
all
the
fellars
who
stick
to
could
jeff
be
so
faithless
after
so
many
years
my
uncle
foreman
oh
how
do
you
know
reckon
i
guessed
long
ago
but
was
shore
miss
nell
there
a
lot
in
the
wind
lately
as
poor
old
al
grows
weaker
mulvey
has
been
particular
friendly
to
me
an
i
nursed
him
along
i
drink
an
his
pards
have
been
particular
friends
with
me
too
more
an
more
as
i
loosened
up
you
see
they
was
shy
of
me
when
i
first
got
here
the
whole
deal
showed
clear
to
me
like
a
hoof
track
in
soft
ground
bud
lewis
who
bunked
with
me
come
out
an
tried
to
win
me
over
to
beasley
soon
as
auchincloss
dies
i
palavered
with
bud
an
i
wanted
to
know
but
bud
would
only
say
he
was
goin
along
with
jeff
others
of
the
outfit
i
told
him
i
reckon
over
it
an
let
him
know
he
thinks
i
come
why
why
will
these
men
leave
me
when
when
oh
poor
uncle
they
bargain
on
his
death
but
why
tell
me
why
beasley
has
worked
on
them
won
them
over
replied
carmichael
grimly
after
al
dies
the
ranch
will
go
to
you
beasley
means
to
have
it
he
an
al
was
pards
once
an
now
beasley
has
most
folks
here
believin
he
got
the
short
end
of
thet
deal
he
have
papers
shore
an
he
have
most
of
the
men
so
he
just
put
you
off
an
take
possession
all
miss
nell
an
you
can
rely
on
its
bein
i
i
believe
you
but
i
ca
believe
such
such
robbery
possible
gasped
helen
it
simple
as
two
an
two
possession
is
law
out
here
once
beasley
gets
on
the
ground
it
settled
what
could
you
do
with
no
men
to
fight
for
your
property
but
surely
some
of
the
men
will
stay
with
me
i
reckon
but
not
then
i
can
hire
more
the
beeman
boys
and
dale
would
come
to
help
dale
would
come
an
he
help
a
heap
i
wish
he
was
here
replied
carmichael
soberly
but
there
no
way
to
get
him
he
till
i
dare
not
confide
in
uncle
said
helen
with
agitation
the
shock
might
kill
him
then
to
tell
him
of
the
unfaithfulness
of
his
old
men
that
would
be
cruel
oh
it
ca
be
so
bad
as
you
i
reckon
it
could
be
no
worse
an
miss
nell
there
only
one
way
to
get
out
of
it
an
thet
the
way
of
the
how
queried
helen
eagerly
carmichael
lunged
himself
erect
and
stood
gazing
down
at
her
he
seemed
completely
detached
now
from
that
frank
amiable
cowboy
of
her
first
impressions
the
redness
was
totally
gone
from
his
face
something
strange
and
cold
and
sure
looked
out
of
his
eyes
i
seen
beasley
go
in
the
saloon
as
i
rode
past
suppose
i
go
down
there
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
an
kill
him
helen
sat
with
a
cold
shock
carmichael
you
not
serious
she
exclaimed
serious
i
shore
am
thet
the
only
way
miss
nell
an
i
reckon
what
al
would
want
an
between
you
an
me
it
would
be
easier
than
ropin
a
calf
these
fellars
round
pine
do
savvy
guns
now
i
come
from
where
guns
mean
somethin
an
when
i
tell
you
i
can
throw
a
gun
slick
an
fast
why
i
shore
ai
braggin
you
need
worry
none
about
me
miss
helen
grasped
that
he
had
taken
the
signs
of
her
shocked
sensibility
to
mean
she
feared
for
his
life
but
what
had
sickened
her
was
the
mere
idea
of
bloodshed
in
her
behalf
you
kill
beasley
just
because
there
are
rumors
of
his
treachery
gasped
helen
shore
it
have
to
be
done
anyhow
replied
the
cowboy
no
no
it
too
dreadful
to
think
of
why
that
would
be
murder
i
i
ca
understand
how
you
speak
of
it
so
so
reckon
i
ai
doin
it
calmly
i
as
mad
as
hell
said
carmichael
with
a
reckless
smile
oh
if
you
are
serious
then
i
say
no
no
no
i
forbid
you
i
believe
i
be
robbed
of
my
wal
supposin
beasley
does
put
you
off
an
takes
possession
what
you
goin
to
say
then
demanded
the
cowboy
in
slow
cool
deliberation
i
say
the
same
then
as
now
she
replied
he
bent
his
head
thoughtfully
while
his
red
hands
smoothed
his
sombrero
shore
you
girls
have
been
west
very
long
he
muttered
as
if
apologizing
for
them
an
i
reckon
it
takes
time
to
learn
the
ways
of
a
west
or
no
west
i
wo
have
fights
deliberately
picked
and
men
shot
even
if
they
do
threaten
me
declared
helen
positively
all
right
miss
nell
shore
i
respect
your
wishes
he
returned
but
i
tell
you
this
if
beasley
turns
you
an
bo
out
of
your
home
wal
i
look
him
up
on
my
own
helen
could
only
gaze
at
him
as
he
backed
to
the
door
and
she
thrilled
and
shuddered
at
what
seemed
his
loyalty
to
her
his
love
for
bo
and
that
which
was
inevitable
in
himself
reckon
you
might
save
us
all
some
trouble
now
if
you
just
get
mad
an
let
me
go
after
thet
greaser
do
you
mean
beasley
shore
he
a
he
was
born
in
magdalena
where
i
heard
folks
say
nary
one
of
his
parents
was
no
that
does
matter
i
thinking
of
humanity
of
law
and
order
of
what
is
wal
miss
nell
i
wait
till
you
get
real
mad
or
till
beasley
but
my
friend
i
not
get
mad
interrupted
helen
i
keep
my
i
bet
you
do
he
retorted
mebbe
you
think
you
none
of
bo
in
you
but
i
bet
you
could
get
so
mad
once
you
started
thet
be
turrible
what
you
got
them
eyes
for
miss
nell
if
you
ai
an
auchincloss
he
was
smiling
yet
he
meant
every
word
helen
felt
the
truth
as
something
she
feared
las
vegas
i
wo
bet
but
you
you
will
always
come
to
me
first
if
there
i
promise
he
replied
soberly
and
then
went
out
helen
found
that
she
was
trembling
and
that
there
was
a
commotion
in
her
breast
carmichael
had
frightened
her
no
longer
did
she
hold
doubt
of
the
gravity
of
the
situation
she
had
seen
beasley
often
several
times
close
at
hand
and
once
she
had
been
forced
to
meet
him
that
time
had
convinced
her
that
he
had
evinced
personal
interest
in
her
and
on
this
account
coupled
with
the
fact
that
riggs
appeared
to
have
nothing
else
to
do
but
shadow
her
she
had
been
slow
in
developing
her
intention
of
organizing
and
teaching
a
school
for
the
children
of
pine
riggs
had
become
rather
a
doubtful
celebrity
in
the
settlements
yet
his
bold
apparent
badness
had
made
its
impression
from
all
reports
he
spent
his
time
gambling
drinking
and
bragging
it
was
no
longer
news
in
pine
what
his
intentions
were
toward
helen
rayner
twice
he
had
ridden
up
to
the
upon
one
occasion
securing
an
interview
with
helen
in
spite
of
her
contempt
and
indifference
he
was
actually
influencing
her
life
there
in
pine
and
it
began
to
appear
that
the
other
man
beasley
might
soon
direct
stronger
significance
upon
the
liberty
of
her
actions
the
responsibility
of
the
ranch
had
turned
out
to
be
a
heavy
burden
it
could
not
be
managed
at
least
by
her
in
the
way
auchincloss
wanted
it
done
he
was
old
irritable
irrational
and
hard
almost
all
the
neighbors
were
set
against
him
and
naturally
did
not
take
kindly
to
helen
she
had
not
found
the
slightest
evidence
of
unfair
dealing
on
the
part
of
her
uncle
but
he
had
been
a
hard
driver
then
his
shrewd
judgment
had
made
all
his
deals
fortunate
for
him
which
fact
had
not
brought
a
profit
of
friendship
of
late
since
auchincloss
had
grown
weaker
and
less
dominating
helen
had
taken
many
decisions
upon
herself
with
gratifying
and
hopeful
results
but
the
wonderful
happiness
that
she
had
expected
to
find
in
the
west
still
held
aloof
the
memory
of
paradise
park
seemed
only
a
dream
sweeter
and
more
intangible
as
time
passed
and
fuller
of
vague
regrets
bo
was
a
comfort
but
also
a
very
considerable
source
of
anxiety
she
might
have
been
a
help
to
helen
if
she
had
not
assimilated
western
ways
so
swiftly
helen
wished
to
decide
things
in
her
own
way
which
was
as
yet
quite
far
from
western
so
helen
had
been
thrown
more
and
more
upon
her
own
resources
with
the
cowboy
carmichael
the
only
one
who
had
come
forward
voluntarily
to
her
aid
for
an
hour
helen
sat
alone
in
the
room
looking
out
of
the
window
and
facing
stern
reality
with
a
colder
graver
keener
sense
of
intimacy
than
ever
before
to
hold
her
property
and
to
live
her
life
in
this
community
according
to
her
ideas
of
honesty
justice
and
law
might
well
be
beyond
her
powers
she
had
been
convinced
that
she
could
not
do
so
without
fighting
for
them
and
to
fight
she
must
have
friends
that
conviction
warmed
her
toward
carmichael
and
a
thoughtful
consideration
of
all
he
had
done
for
her
proved
that
she
had
not
fully
appreciated
him
she
would
make
up
for
her
oversight
there
were
no
mormons
in
her
employ
for
the
good
reason
that
auchincloss
would
not
hire
them
but
in
one
of
his
kindlier
hours
growing
rare
now
he
had
admitted
that
the
mormons
were
the
best
and
the
most
sober
faithful
workers
on
the
ranges
and
that
his
sole
objection
to
them
was
just
this
fact
of
their
superiority
helen
decided
to
hire
the
four
beemans
and
any
of
their
relatives
or
friends
who
would
come
and
to
do
this
if
possible
without
letting
her
uncle
know
his
temper
now
as
well
as
his
judgment
was
a
hindrance
to
efficiency
this
decision
regarding
the
beemans
brought
helen
back
to
fervent
wish
for
dale
and
then
to
her
own
soon
spring
would
be
at
hand
with
its
multiplicity
of
range
tasks
dale
had
promised
to
come
to
pine
then
and
helen
knew
that
promise
would
be
kept
her
heart
beat
a
little
faster
in
spite
of
her
thoughts
dale
was
there
over
the
mountain
shut
away
from
the
world
helen
almost
envied
him
no
wonder
he
loved
loneliness
solitude
the
sweet
wild
silence
and
beauty
of
paradise
park
but
he
was
selfish
and
helen
meant
to
show
him
that
she
needed
his
help
when
she
recalled
his
physical
prowess
with
animals
and
imagined
what
it
must
be
in
relation
to
men
she
actually
smiled
at
the
thought
of
beasley
forcing
her
off
her
property
if
dale
were
there
beasley
would
only
force
disaster
upon
himself
then
helen
experienced
a
quick
shock
would
dale
answer
to
this
situation
as
carmichael
had
answered
it
afforded
her
relief
to
assure
herself
to
the
contrary
the
cowboy
was
one
of
a
breed
the
hunter
was
a
man
of
thought
gentleness
humanity
this
situation
was
one
of
the
kind
that
had
made
him
despise
the
littleness
of
men
helen
assured
herself
that
he
was
different
from
her
uncle
and
from
the
cowboy
in
all
the
relations
of
life
which
she
had
observed
while
with
him
but
a
doubt
lingered
in
her
mind
she
remembered
his
calm
reference
to
snake
anson
and
that
caused
a
recurrence
of
the
little
shiver
carmichael
had
given
her
when
the
doubt
augmented
to
a
possibility
that
she
might
not
be
able
to
control
dale
then
she
tried
not
to
think
of
it
any
more
it
confused
and
perplexed
her
that
into
her
mind
should
flash
a
thought
that
though
it
would
be
dreadful
for
carmichael
to
kill
beasley
for
dale
to
do
it
would
be
a
calamity
a
terrible
thing
helen
did
not
analyze
that
strange
thought
she
was
as
afraid
of
it
as
she
was
of
the
stir
in
her
blood
when
she
visualized
dale
her
meditation
was
interrupted
by
bo
who
entered
the
room
and
very
lofty
her
manner
changed
which
apparently
owed
its
cause
to
the
fact
that
helen
was
alone
is
that
cowboy
gone
she
asked
yes
he
left
quite
some
time
ago
replied
helen
i
wondered
if
he
made
your
eyes
shine
your
color
burn
so
nell
just
is
my
face
burning
asked
helen
with
a
little
laugh
so
it
is
well
bo
you
no
cause
for
jealousy
las
vegas
ca
be
blamed
for
my
jealous
me
of
that
i
guess
not
nell
rayner
what
he
say
about
me
bo
he
said
a
lot
replied
helen
reflectively
i
tell
you
presently
first
i
want
to
ask
you
has
carmichael
ever
told
you
how
he
helped
me
no
when
i
see
him
which
has
been
often
lately
he
i
well
we
fight
nell
has
he
helped
you
helen
smiled
in
faint
amusement
she
was
going
to
be
sincere
but
she
meant
to
keep
her
word
to
the
cowboy
the
fact
was
that
reflection
had
acquainted
her
with
her
indebtedness
to
carmichael
bo
you
been
so
wild
to
ride
mustangs
and
carry
on
with
cowboys
and
read
and
sew
and
keep
your
secrets
that
you
had
no
time
for
your
sister
or
her
nell
burst
out
bo
in
amaze
and
pain
she
flew
to
helen
and
seized
her
hands
what
you
saying
it
all
true
replied
helen
thrilling
and
softening
this
sweet
sister
once
aroused
would
be
hard
to
resist
helen
imagined
she
should
hold
to
her
tone
of
reproach
and
severity
sure
it
true
cried
bo
fiercely
but
what
my
fooling
got
to
do
with
the
the
rest
you
said
nell
are
you
keeping
things
from
me
my
dear
i
never
get
any
encouragement
to
tell
you
my
but
i
i
nursed
uncle
sat
up
with
him
just
the
same
as
you
said
bo
with
quivering
lips
yes
you
been
good
to
we
no
other
troubles
have
we
nell
you
have
but
i
have
responded
helen
reproachfully
why
why
did
you
tell
me
cried
bo
passionately
what
are
they
tell
me
now
you
must
think
me
a
a
selfish
hateful
bo
i
had
much
to
worry
me
and
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
replied
helen
then
she
told
bo
how
complicated
and
bewildering
was
the
management
of
a
big
ranch
when
the
owner
was
ill
testy
defective
in
memory
and
hard
as
steel
when
he
had
hoards
of
gold
and
notes
but
could
not
or
would
not
remember
his
obligations
when
the
neighbor
ranchers
had
just
claims
when
cowboys
and
were
discontented
and
wrangled
among
themselves
when
great
herds
of
cattle
and
flocks
of
sheep
had
to
be
fed
in
winter
when
supplies
had
to
be
continually
freighted
across
a
muddy
desert
and
lastly
when
an
enemy
rancher
was
slowly
winning
away
the
best
hands
with
the
end
in
view
of
deliberately
taking
over
the
property
when
the
owner
died
then
helen
told
how
she
had
only
that
day
realized
the
extent
of
advice
and
help
and
labor
how
indeed
he
had
been
a
brother
to
her
how
but
at
this
juncture
bo
buried
her
face
in
helen
breast
and
began
to
cry
wildly
i
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
she
sobbed
well
you
got
to
hear
it
replied
helen
inexorably
i
want
you
to
know
how
he
stood
by
but
i
hate
bo
i
suspect
that
not
i
do
i
well
you
act
and
talk
very
strangely
nell
rayner
are
you
you
sticking
up
for
that
that
devil
i
am
yes
so
far
as
it
concerns
my
conscience
rejoined
helen
earnestly
i
never
appreciated
him
as
he
deserved
not
until
now
a
man
bo
every
inch
of
him
i
seen
him
grow
up
to
that
in
three
months
i
never
have
gotten
along
without
him
i
think
he
fine
manly
big
i
i
bet
he
made
love
to
you
too
replied
bo
woefully
talk
sense
said
helen
sharply
he
has
been
a
brother
to
me
but
bo
rayner
if
he
had
made
love
to
me
i
i
might
have
appreciated
it
more
than
bo
raised
her
face
flushed
in
part
and
also
pale
with
cheeks
and
the
telltale
blaze
in
the
blue
eyes
i
been
wild
about
that
fellow
but
i
hate
him
too
she
said
with
flashing
spirit
and
i
want
to
go
on
hating
him
so
do
tell
me
any
whereupon
helen
briefly
and
graphically
related
how
carmichael
had
offered
to
kill
beasley
as
the
only
way
to
save
her
property
and
how
when
she
refused
that
he
threatened
he
would
do
it
anyhow
bo
fell
over
with
a
gasp
and
clung
to
helen
oh
nell
oh
now
i
love
him
more
than
ever
she
cried
in
mingled
rage
and
despair
helen
clasped
her
closely
and
tried
to
comfort
her
as
in
the
old
days
not
so
very
far
back
when
troubles
were
not
so
serious
as
now
of
course
you
love
him
she
concluded
i
guessed
that
long
ago
and
i
glad
but
you
been
wilful
foolish
you
would
surrender
to
it
you
wanted
your
fling
with
the
other
boys
you
oh
bo
i
fear
you
have
been
a
sad
little
i
i
was
very
bad
till
till
he
got
bossy
why
nell
he
acted
right
off
just
as
if
he
owned
me
but
he
did
and
to
show
him
i
i
really
did
flirt
with
that
turner
fellow
then
he
he
insulted
me
oh
i
hate
him
nonsense
bo
you
ca
hate
any
one
while
you
love
him
protested
helen
much
you
know
about
that
flashed
bo
you
just
can
look
here
did
you
ever
see
a
cowboy
rope
and
throw
and
tie
up
a
mean
horse
yes
i
do
you
have
any
idea
how
strong
a
cowboy
is
how
his
hands
and
arms
are
like
iron
yes
i
sure
i
know
that
and
how
savage
he
is
and
how
he
goes
at
anything
he
wants
to
do
i
must
admit
cowboys
are
abrupt
responded
helen
with
a
smile
well
miss
rayner
did
you
ever
when
you
were
standing
quiet
like
a
lady
did
you
ever
have
a
cowboy
dive
at
you
with
a
terrible
lunge
grab
you
and
hold
you
so
you
could
move
or
breathe
or
scream
hug
you
till
all
your
bones
cracked
and
kiss
you
so
fierce
and
so
hard
that
you
wanted
to
kill
him
and
die
helen
had
gradually
drawn
back
from
this
eloquent
sister
and
when
the
end
of
that
remarkable
question
came
it
was
impossible
to
reply
there
i
see
you
never
had
that
done
to
you
resumed
bo
with
satisfaction
so
do
ever
talk
to
i
heard
his
side
of
the
story
said
helen
constrainedly
with
a
start
bo
sat
up
straighter
as
if
better
to
defend
herself
oh
so
you
have
and
i
suppose
you
take
his
part
even
about
that
that
bearish
no
i
think
that
rude
and
bold
but
bo
i
do
believe
he
meant
to
be
either
rude
or
bold
from
what
he
confessed
to
me
i
gather
that
he
believed
he
lose
you
outright
or
win
you
outright
by
that
violence
it
seems
girls
ca
play
at
love
out
here
in
this
wild
west
he
said
there
would
be
blood
shed
over
you
i
begin
to
realize
what
he
meant
not
sorry
for
what
he
did
think
how
strange
that
is
for
he
has
the
instincts
of
a
gentleman
he
kind
gentle
chivalrous
evidently
he
had
tried
every
way
to
win
your
favor
except
any
familiar
advance
he
did
that
as
a
last
resort
in
my
opinion
his
motives
were
to
force
you
to
accept
or
refuse
him
and
in
case
you
refused
him
he
always
have
those
forbidden
stolen
kisses
to
assuage
his
when
he
thought
of
turner
or
any
one
else
daring
to
be
familiar
with
you
bo
i
see
through
carmichael
even
if
i
do
make
him
clear
to
you
got
to
be
honest
with
yourself
did
that
act
of
his
win
or
lose
you
in
other
words
do
you
love
him
or
not
bo
hid
her
face
oh
nell
it
made
me
see
how
i
loved
him
and
that
made
me
so
so
sick
i
hated
him
but
now
the
hate
is
all
chapter
xvii
when
spring
came
at
last
and
the
willows
drooped
green
and
fresh
over
the
brook
and
the
range
rang
with
bray
of
burro
and
whistle
of
stallion
old
al
auchincloss
had
been
a
month
in
his
grave
to
helen
it
seemed
longer
the
month
had
been
crowded
with
work
events
and
growing
more
hopeful
duties
so
that
it
contained
a
world
of
living
the
uncle
had
not
been
forgotten
but
the
innumerable
restrictions
to
development
and
progress
were
no
longer
manifest
beasley
had
not
presented
himself
or
any
claim
upon
helen
and
she
gathering
confidence
day
by
day
began
to
believe
all
that
purport
of
trouble
had
been
exaggerated
in
this
time
she
had
come
to
love
her
work
and
all
that
pertained
to
it
the
estate
was
large
she
had
no
accurate
knowledge
of
how
many
acres
she
owned
but
it
was
more
than
two
thousand
the
fine
old
rambling
set
like
a
fort
on
the
last
of
the
corrals
and
fields
and
barns
and
meadows
and
the
rolling
green
range
beyond
and
innumerable
sheep
horses
cattle
all
these
belonged
to
helen
to
her
realization
and
joy
still
she
was
afraid
to
let
herself
go
and
be
perfectly
happy
always
there
was
the
fear
that
had
been
too
deep
and
strong
to
forget
so
soon
this
bright
fresh
morning
in
march
helen
came
out
upon
the
porch
to
revel
a
little
in
the
warmth
of
sunshine
and
the
crisp
wind
that
swept
down
from
the
mountains
there
was
never
a
morning
that
she
did
not
gaze
mountainward
trying
to
see
with
a
folly
she
realized
if
the
snow
had
melted
more
perceptibly
away
on
the
bold
white
ridge
for
all
she
could
see
it
had
not
melted
an
inch
and
she
would
not
confess
why
she
sighed
the
desert
had
become
green
and
fresh
stretching
away
there
far
below
her
range
growing
dark
and
purple
in
the
distance
with
vague
buttes
rising
the
air
was
full
of
sound
notes
of
blackbirds
and
the
baas
of
sheep
and
blasts
from
the
corrals
and
the
clatter
of
light
hoofs
on
the
court
below
bo
was
riding
in
from
the
stables
helen
loved
to
watch
her
on
one
of
those
fiery
little
mustangs
but
the
sight
was
likewise
given
to
rousing
apprehensions
this
morning
bo
appeared
particularly
bent
on
frightening
helen
down
the
lane
carmichael
appeared
waving
his
arms
and
helen
at
once
connected
him
with
bo
manifest
desire
to
fly
away
from
that
particular
place
since
that
day
a
month
back
when
bo
had
confessed
her
love
for
carmichael
she
and
helen
had
not
spoken
of
it
or
of
the
cowboy
the
boy
and
girl
were
still
at
odds
but
this
did
not
worry
helen
bo
had
changed
much
for
the
better
especially
in
that
she
devoted
herself
to
helen
and
to
her
work
helen
knew
that
all
would
turn
out
well
in
the
end
and
so
she
had
been
careful
of
her
rather
precarious
position
between
these
two
young
firebrands
bo
reined
in
the
mustang
at
the
porch
steps
she
wore
a
buckskin
which
she
had
made
herself
and
its
soft
gray
with
the
touches
of
red
beads
was
mightily
becoming
to
her
then
she
had
grown
considerably
during
the
winter
and
now
looked
too
flashing
and
pretty
to
resemble
a
boy
yet
singularly
healthy
and
strong
and
lithe
red
spots
shone
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
held
that
blaze
nell
did
you
give
me
away
to
that
cowboy
she
demanded
give
you
away
exclaimed
helen
blankly
yes
you
know
i
told
you
awhile
back
that
i
was
wildly
in
love
with
him
did
you
give
me
away
tell
on
me
she
might
have
been
furious
but
she
certainly
was
not
confused
why
bo
how
could
you
no
i
did
not
replied
helen
never
gave
him
a
hint
not
even
a
hint
you
have
my
word
for
that
why
what
happened
he
makes
me
bo
would
not
say
any
more
owing
to
the
near
approach
of
the
cowboy
mawnin
miss
nell
he
drawled
i
was
just
tellin
this
here
miss
rayner

call
me

in
bo
with

in
her
voice
wal

off
on
any
more
of
them
long
rides

now
miss

to
kingdom

or

among

apaches
or

at
this
he
grinned
knowingly
or
anywheres
for
all
i
cared
but
i
workin
for
miss
nell
an
boss
an
if
she
says

was
a
treat
for
helen
to

cowboy

ask
how
you

going
to
prevent

this
way
i
keep
you
a
hoss
if
i
have
to
rope
you
an
tie
you
up
by
golly
i
will
his
dry
humor
was
gone
and
manifestly
he
meant
what
he
said
wal
she
drawled
it
very
softly
and
sweetly
but
venomously
if
you
ever
touch
me
again
at
this
he
flushed
then
made
a
quick
passionate
gesture
with
his
hand
expressive
of
heat
and
shame
you
an
me
will
never
get
along
he
said
with
a
dignity
full
of
pathos
i
seen
thet
a
month
back
when
you
changed
to
me
but
nothin
i
say
to
you
has
any
reckonin
of
mine
i
talkin
for
your
sister
it
for
her
sake
an
your
own
i
never
told
her
an
i
never
told
you
thet
i
seen
riggs
sneakin
after
you
twice
on
them
desert
rides
wal
i
tell
you
the
intelligence
apparently
had
not
the
slightest
effect
on
bo
but
helen
was
astonished
and
alarmed
riggs
oh
bo
i
seen
him
myself
riding
around
he
does
not
mean
well
you
must
be
if
i
ketch
him
again
went
on
carmichael
with
his
mouth
lining
hard
i
goin
after
he
gave
her
a
cool
intent
piercing
look
then
he
dropped
his
head
and
turned
away
to
stride
back
toward
the
corrals
helen
could
make
little
of
the
manner
in
which
her
sister
watched
the
cowboy
pass
out
of
sight
a
month
back
when
i
changed
mused
bo
i
wonder
what
he
meant
by
that
nell
did
i
change
right
after
the
talk
you
had
with
me
about
him
indeed
you
did
bo
replied
helen
but
it
was
for
the
better
only
he
ca
see
it
how
proud
and
sensitive
he
is
you
would
guess
it
at
first
bo
your
reserve
has
wounded
him
more
than
your
flirting
he
thinks
it
maybe
that
be
good
for
him
declared
bo
does
he
expect
me
to
fall
on
his
neck
he
that
why
he
the
locoed
one
not
i
like
to
ask
you
bo
if
you
seen
how
he
has
changed
queried
helen
earnestly
he
older
he
worried
either
his
heart
is
breaking
for
you
or
else
he
fears
trouble
for
us
i
fear
it
both
how
he
watches
you
bo
he
knows
all
you
do
where
you
go
that
about
riggs
sickens
if
riggs
follows
me
and
tries
any
of
his
desperado
games
he
have
his
hands
full
said
bo
grimly
and
that
without
my
cowboy
protector
but
i
just
wish
riggs
would
do
something
then
we
see
what
las
vegas
tom
carmichael
cares
then
we
see
bo
bit
out
the
last
words
passionately
and
jealously
then
she
lifted
her
bridle
to
the
spirited
mustang
nell
do
you
fear
for
me
she
said
i
can
take
care
of
helen
watched
her
ride
away
all
but
willing
to
confess
that
there
might
be
truth
in
what
bo
said
then
helen
went
about
her
work
which
consisted
of
routine
duties
as
well
as
an
earnest
study
to
familiarize
herself
with
continually
new
and
complex
conditions
of
ranch
life
every
day
brought
new
problems
she
made
notes
of
all
that
she
observed
and
all
that
was
told
her
which
habit
she
had
found
after
a
few
weeks
of
trial
was
going
to
be
exceedingly
valuable
to
her
she
did
not
intend
always
to
be
dependent
upon
the
knowledge
of
hired
men
however
faithful
some
of
them
might
be
this
morning
on
her
rounds
she
had
expected
developments
of
some
kind
owing
to
the
presence
of
roy
beeman
and
two
of
his
brothers
who
had
arrived
yesterday
and
she
was
to
discover
that
jeff
mulvey
accompanied
by
six
of
his
and
associates
had
deserted
her
without
a
word
or
even
sending
for
their
pay
carmichael
had
predicted
this
helen
had
half
doubted
it
was
a
relief
now
to
be
confronted
with
facts
however
disturbing
she
had
fortified
herself
to
withstand
a
great
deal
more
trouble
than
had
happened
at
the
gateway
of
the
main
corral
a
huge
inclosure
fenced
high
with
peeled
logs
she
met
roy
beeman
lasso
in
hand
the
same
tall
lean
limping
figure
she
remembered
so
well
sight
of
him
gave
her
an
inexplicable
thrill
a
flashing
memory
of
an
unforgettable
night
ride
roy
was
to
have
charge
of
the
horses
on
the
ranch
of
which
there
were
several
hundred
not
counting
many
lost
on
range
and
mountain
or
the
unbranded
colts
roy
took
off
his
sombrero
and
greeted
her
this
mormon
had
a
courtesy
for
women
that
spoke
well
for
him
helen
wished
she
had
more
employees
like
him
it
jest
as
las
vegas
told
us
it
be
he
said
regretfully
mulvey
an
his
pards
lit
out
this
mornin
i
sorry
miss
helen
reckon
all
because
i
come
i
heard
the
news
replied
helen
you
need
be
sorry
roy
for
not
i
glad
i
want
to
know
whom
i
can
las
vegas
says
we
shore
in
for
it
roy
what
do
you
think
i
reckon
so
still
las
vegas
is
powerful
cross
these
days
an
always
lookin
on
the
dark
side
with
us
boys
now
it
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
thereof
but
miss
helen
if
beasley
forces
the
deal
there
will
be
serious
trouble
i
seen
thet
happen
four
or
five
years
ago
beasley
rode
some
greasers
off
their
farms
an
no
one
ever
knowed
if
he
had
a
just
beasley
has
no
claim
on
my
property
my
uncle
solemnly
swore
that
on
his
and
i
find
nothing
in
his
books
or
papers
of
those
years
when
he
employed
beasley
in
fact
beasley
was
never
uncle
partner
the
truth
is
that
my
uncle
took
beasley
up
when
he
was
a
poor
homeless
so
my
old
dad
says
replied
roy
but
what
right
do
always
prevail
in
these
roy
you
the
keenest
man
i
met
since
i
came
west
tell
me
what
you
think
will
beeman
appeared
flattered
but
he
hesitated
to
reply
helen
had
long
been
aware
of
the
reticence
of
these
outdoor
men
i
reckon
you
mean
cause
an
effect
as
milt
dale
would
say
responded
roy
thoughtfully
yes
if
beasley
attempts
to
force
me
off
my
ranch
what
will
happen
roy
looked
up
and
met
her
gaze
helen
remembered
that
singular
stillness
intentness
of
his
face
wal
if
dale
an
john
get
here
in
time
i
reckon
we
can
bluff
thet
beasley
you
mean
my
friends
my
men
would
confront
beasley
refuse
his
demands
and
if
necessary
fight
him
off
i
shore
do
replied
roy
but
suppose
you
not
all
here
beasley
would
be
smart
enough
to
choose
an
opportune
time
suppose
he
did
put
me
off
and
take
possession
what
then
then
it
only
be
a
matter
of
how
soon
dale
or
carmichael
or
i
got
to
roy
i
feared
just
that
it
haunts
me
carmichael
asked
me
to
let
him
go
pick
a
fight
with
beasley
asked
me
just
as
he
would
ask
me
about
his
work
i
was
shocked
and
now
you
say
dale
and
you
helen
choked
in
her
agitation
miss
helen
what
else
could
you
look
for
las
vegas
is
in
love
with
miss
bo
shore
he
told
me
so
an
dale
in
love
with
you
why
you
could
stop
them
any
more
you
could
stop
the
wind
from
blowin
down
a
pine
when
it
got
ready
now
it
some
different
with
me
i
a
mormon
an
i
married
but
i
dale
pard
these
many
years
i
care
a
powerful
sight
for
you
an
miss
bo
so
i
reckon
i
draw
on
beasley
the
first
chance
i
helen
strove
for
utterance
but
it
was
denied
her
roy
simple
statement
of
dale
love
had
magnified
her
emotion
by
completely
changing
its
direction
she
forgot
what
she
had
felt
wretched
about
she
could
not
look
at
roy
miss
helen
do
feel
bad
he
said
kindly
shore
you
not
to
blame
your
comin
west
has
made
any
difference
in
beasley
fate
except
mebbe
to
hurry
it
a
little
my
dad
is
old
an
when
he
talks
it
like
history
he
looks
back
on
happenin
wal
it
the
nature
of
happenin
that
beasley
passes
away
before
his
prime
them
of
his
breed
do
live
old
in
the
west
so
i
reckon
you
need
feel
bad
or
worry
you
got
helen
incoherently
thanked
him
and
forgetting
her
usual
round
of
corrals
and
stables
she
hurried
back
toward
the
house
deeply
stirred
throbbing
and
with
a
feeling
she
could
not
control
roy
beeman
had
made
a
statement
that
had
upset
her
equilibrium
it
seemed
simple
and
natural
yet
momentous
and
staggering
to
hear
that
dale
loved
her
to
hear
it
spoken
frankly
earnestly
by
dale
best
friend
was
strange
sweet
terrifying
but
was
it
true
her
own
consciousness
had
admitted
it
yet
that
was
vastly
different
from
a
man
open
statement
no
longer
was
it
a
dear
dream
a
secret
that
seemed
hers
alone
how
she
had
lived
on
that
secret
hidden
deep
in
her
breast
something
burned
the
dimness
from
her
eyes
as
she
looked
toward
the
mountains
and
her
sight
became
clear
telescopic
with
its
intensity
magnificently
the
mountains
loomed
black
inroads
and
patches
on
the
slopes
showed
where
a
few
days
back
all
bad
been
white
the
snow
was
melting
fast
dale
would
soon
be
free
to
ride
down
to
pine
and
that
was
an
event
helen
prayed
for
yet
feared
as
she
had
never
feared
anything
the
noonday
startled
helen
from
a
reverie
that
was
a
pleasant
aftermath
of
her
unrestraint
how
the
hours
had
flown
this
morning
at
least
must
be
credited
to
indolence
bo
was
not
in
the
nor
in
her
own
room
nor
was
she
in
sight
from
window
or
door
this
absence
had
occurred
before
but
not
particularly
to
disturb
helen
in
this
instance
however
she
grew
worried
her
nerves
presaged
strain
there
was
an
overcharge
of
sensibility
in
her
feelings
or
a
strange
pressure
in
the
very
atmosphere
she
ate
dinner
alone
looking
her
apprehension
which
was
not
mitigated
by
the
expressive
fears
of
old
maria
the
mexican
woman
who
served
her
after
dinner
she
sent
word
to
roy
and
carmichael
that
they
had
better
ride
out
to
look
for
bo
then
helen
applied
herself
resolutely
to
her
books
until
a
rapid
clatter
of
hoofs
out
in
the
court
caused
her
to
jump
up
and
hurry
to
the
porch
roy
was
riding
in
did
you
find
her
queried
helen
hurriedly
was
no
track
or
sign
of
her
up
the
north
range
replied
roy
as
he
dismounted
and
threw
his
bridle
an
i
was
ridin
back
to
take
up
her
tracks
from
the
corral
an
trail
her
but
i
seen
las
vegas
comin
an
he
waved
his
sombrero
he
was
comin
up
from
the
south
there
he
is
carmichael
appeared
swinging
into
the
lane
he
was
mounted
on
big
black
ranger
and
he
made
the
dust
fly
wal
he
seen
her
thet
shore
vouchsafed
roy
with
relief
as
carmichael
rode
up
miss
nell
she
comin
said
the
cowboy
as
he
reined
in
and
slid
down
with
his
graceful
single
motion
then
in
a
violent
action
characteristic
of
him
he
slammed
his
sombrero
down
on
the
porch
and
threw
up
both
arms
i
a
hunch
it
come
off
oh
what
exclaimed
helen
now
las
vegas
talk
sense
expostulated
roy
miss
helen
is
shore
nervous
has
anythin
happened
i
reckon
but
i
do
know
what
replied
carmichael
drawing
a
long
breath
folks
i
must
be
gettin
old
for
i
shore
felt
orful
queer
till
i
seen
bo
she
was
ridin
down
the
ridge
across
the
valley
ridin
some
fast
too
an
she
be
here
right
off
if
she
does
stop
in
the
wal
i
hear
her
comin
now
said
roy
an
if
you
asked
me
i
say
she
was
ridin
some
helen
heard
the
light
swift
rhythmic
beat
of
hoofs
and
then
out
on
the
curve
of
the
road
that
led
down
to
pine
she
saw
bo
mustang
white
with
lather
coming
on
a
dead
run
las
vegas
do
you
see
any
apaches
asked
roy
quizzingly
the
cowboy
made
no
reply
but
he
strode
out
from
the
porch
directly
in
front
of
the
mustang
bo
was
pulling
hard
on
the
bridle
and
had
him
slowing
down
but
not
controlled
when
he
reached
the
house
it
could
easily
be
seen
that
bo
had
pulled
him
to
the
limit
of
her
strength
which
was
not
enough
to
halt
him
carmichael
lunged
for
the
bridle
and
seizing
it
hauled
him
to
a
standstill
at
close
sight
of
bo
helen
uttered
a
startled
cry
bo
was
white
her
sombrero
was
gone
and
her
hair
undone
there
were
blood
and
dirt
on
her
face
and
her
was
torn
and
muddy
she
had
evidently
sustained
a
fall
roy
gazed
at
her
in
admiring
consternation
but
carmichael
never
looked
at
her
at
all
apparently
he
was
examining
the
horse
well
help
me
off
somebody
cried
bo
peremptorily
her
voice
was
weak
but
not
her
spirit
roy
sprang
to
help
her
off
and
when
she
was
down
it
developed
that
she
was
lame
oh
bo
you
had
a
tumble
exclaimed
helen
anxiously
and
she
ran
to
assist
roy
they
led
her
up
the
porch
and
to
the
door
there
she
turned
to
look
at
carmichael
who
was
still
examining
the
spent
mustang
tell
him
to
come
in
she
whispered
hey
there
las
vegas
called
roy
rustle
hyar
will
you
when
bo
had
been
led
into
the
and
seated
in
a
chair
carmichael
entered
his
face
was
a
study
as
slowly
he
walked
up
to
bo
girl
you
ai
hurt
he
asked
huskily
it
no
fault
of
yours
that
i
not
crippled
or
dead
or
worse
retorted
bo
you
said
the
south
range
was
the
only
safe
ride
for
me
and
there
i
it
she
panted
a
little
and
her
bosom
heaved
one
of
her
gauntlets
was
gone
and
the
bare
band
that
was
bruised
and
bloody
trembled
as
she
held
it
out
dear
tell
us
are
you
badly
hurt
queried
helen
with
hurried
gentleness
not
much
i
had
a
spill
replied
bo
but
oh
i
mad
boiling
she
looked
as
if
she
might
have
exaggerated
her
doubt
of
injuries
but
certainly
she
had
not
overestimated
her
state
of
mind
any
blaze
helen
had
heretofore
seen
in
those
quick
eyes
was
tame
compared
to
this
one
it
actually
leaped
bo
was
more
than
pretty
then
manifestly
roy
was
admiring
her
looks
but
carmichael
saw
beyond
her
charm
and
slowly
he
was
growing
pale
i
rode
out
the
south
range
as
i
was
told
began
bo
breathing
hard
and
trying
to
control
her
feelings
that
the
ride
you
usually
take
nell
and
you
bet
if
you
taken
it
you
not
be
here
now
about
three
miles
out
i
climbed
off
the
range
up
that
cedar
slope
i
always
keep
to
high
ground
when
i
got
up
i
saw
two
horsemen
ride
out
of
some
broken
rocks
off
to
the
east
they
rode
as
if
to
come
between
me
and
home
i
did
like
that
i
circled
south
about
a
mile
farther
on
i
spied
another
horseman
and
he
showed
up
directly
in
front
of
me
and
came
along
slow
that
i
liked
still
less
it
might
have
been
accident
but
it
looked
to
me
as
if
those
riders
had
some
intent
all
i
could
do
was
head
off
to
the
southeast
and
ride
you
bet
i
did
ride
but
i
got
into
rough
ground
where
i
never
been
before
it
was
slow
going
at
last
i
made
the
cedars
and
here
i
cut
loose
believing
i
could
circle
ahead
of
those
strange
riders
and
come
round
through
pine
i
had
it
here
she
hesitated
perhaps
for
breath
for
she
had
spoken
rapidly
or
perhaps
to
get
better
hold
on
her
subject
not
improbably
the
effect
she
was
creating
on
her
listeners
began
to
be
significant
roy
sat
absorbed
perfectly
motionless
eyes
keen
as
steel
his
mouth
open
carmichael
was
gazing
over
bo
head
out
of
the
window
and
it
seemed
that
he
must
know
the
rest
of
her
narrative
helen
knew
that
her
own
attention
alone
would
have
been
inspiration
to
bo
rayner
sure
i
had
it
wrong
resumed
bo
pretty
soon
heard
a
horse
behind
i
looked
back
i
saw
a
big
bay
riding
down
on
me
oh
but
he
was
running
he
just
tore
through
the
cedars
i
was
scared
half
out
of
my
senses
but
i
spurred
and
beat
my
mustang
then
began
a
race
rough
going
thick
cedars
washes
and
gullies
i
had
to
make
him
run
to
keep
my
saddle
to
pick
my
way
but
it
was
glorious
to
race
for
fun
one
thing
to
race
for
your
life
is
another
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
choking
me
i
could
have
yelled
i
was
as
cold
as
ice
dizzy
sometimes
blind
others
then
my
stomach
turned
and
i
could
get
my
breath
yet
the
wild
thrills
i
had
but
i
stuck
on
and
held
my
own
for
several
miles
to
the
edge
of
the
cedars
there
the
big
horse
gained
on
me
he
came
pounding
closer
perhaps
as
close
as
a
hundred
yards
i
could
hear
him
plain
enough
then
i
had
my
spill
oh
my
mustang
tripped
threw
me
over
his
head
i
hit
light
but
slid
far
and
that
what
scraped
me
so
i
know
my
knee
is
raw
when
i
got
to
my
feet
the
big
horse
dashed
up
throwing
gravel
all
over
me
and
his
rider
jumped
off
now
who
do
you
think
he
was
helen
knew
but
she
did
not
voice
her
conviction
carmichael
knew
positively
yet
he
kept
silent
roy
was
smiling
as
if
the
narrative
told
did
not
seem
so
alarming
to
him
wal
the
fact
of
you
bein
here
safe
an
sound
sorta
makes
no
difference
who
thet
was
he
said
riggs
harve
riggs
blazed
bo
the
instant
i
recognized
him
i
got
over
my
scare
and
so
mad
i
burned
all
through
like
fire
i
do
know
what
i
said
but
it
was
wild
and
it
was
a
whole
lot
you
bet
you
sure
can
ride
he
said
i
demanded
why
he
had
dared
to
chase
me
and
he
said
he
had
an
important
message
for
nell
this
was
it
your
sister
that
beasley
means
to
put
her
off
an
take
the
ranch
if
she
marry
me
i
block
his
deal
if
she
wo
marry
me
i
go
in
with
beasley
then
he
told
me
to
hurry
home
and
not
to
breathe
a
word
to
any
one
except
nell
well
here
i
am
and
i
seem
to
have
been
breathing
rather
she
looked
from
helen
to
roy
and
from
roy
to
las
vegas
her
smile
was
for
the
latter
and
to
any
one
not
overexcited
by
her
story
that
smile
would
have
told
volumes
wal
i
be
doggoned
ejaculated
roy
feelingly
helen
laughed
indeed
the
working
of
that
man
mind
is
beyond
me
marry
him
to
save
my
ranch
i
would
marry
him
to
save
my
life
carmichael
suddenly
broke
his
silence
bo
did
you
see
the
other
men
yes
i
was
coming
to
that
she
replied
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
them
back
in
the
cedars
the
three
were
together
or
at
least
three
horsemen
were
there
they
had
halted
behind
some
trees
then
on
the
way
home
i
began
to
think
even
in
my
fury
i
had
received
impressions
riggs
was
surprised
when
i
got
up
i
bet
he
had
not
expected
me
to
be
who
i
was
he
thought
i
was
nell
i
look
bigger
in
this
buckskin
outfit
my
hair
was
up
till
i
lost
my
hat
and
that
was
when
i
had
the
tumble
he
took
me
for
nell
another
thing
i
remember
he
made
some
sign
some
motion
while
i
was
calling
him
names
and
i
believe
that
was
to
keep
those
other
men
back
i
believe
riggs
had
a
plan
with
those
other
men
to
waylay
nell
and
make
off
with
her
i
absolutely
know
bo
you
so
so
you
jump
at
wild
ideas
so
protested
helen
trying
to
believe
in
her
own
assurance
but
inwardly
she
was
trembling
miss
helen
that
ai
a
wild
idee
said
roy
seriously
i
reckon
your
sister
is
pretty
close
on
the
trail
las
vegas
do
you
savvy
it
thet
way
carmichael
answer
was
to
stalk
out
of
the
room
call
him
back
cried
helen
apprehensively
hold
on
boy
called
roy
sharply
helen
reached
the
door
simultaneously
with
roy
the
cowboy
picked
up
his
sombrero
jammed
it
on
his
head
gave
his
belt
a
vicious
hitch
that
made
the
jump
and
then
in
one
giant
step
he
was
astride
ranger
carmichael
stay
cried
helen
the
cowboy
spurred
the
black
and
the
stones
rang
under
hoofs
bo
call
him
back
please
call
him
back
importuned
helen
in
distress
i
wo
declared
bo
rayner
her
face
shone
whiter
now
and
her
eyes
were
like
fiery
flint
that
was
her
answer
to
a
loving
sister
that
was
her
answer
to
the
call
of
the
west
no
use
said
roy
quietly
an
i
reckon
i
better
trail
him
he
too
strode
out
and
mounting
his
horse
galloped
swiftly
away
it
turned
out
that
bo
was
more
bruised
and
scraped
and
shaken
than
she
had
imagined
one
knee
was
rather
badly
cut
which
injury
alone
would
have
kept
her
from
riding
again
very
soon
helen
who
was
somewhat
skilled
at
bandaging
wounds
worried
a
great
deal
over
these
sundry
blotches
on
bo
fair
skin
and
it
took
considerable
time
to
wash
and
dress
them
long
after
this
was
done
and
during
the
early
supper
and
afterward
bo
excitement
remained
unabated
the
whiteness
stayed
on
her
face
and
the
blaze
in
her
eyes
helen
ordered
and
begged
her
to
go
to
bed
for
the
fact
was
bo
could
not
stand
up
and
her
hands
shook
go
to
bed
not
much
she
said
i
want
to
know
what
he
does
to
it
was
that
possibility
which
had
helen
in
dreadful
suspense
if
carmichael
killed
riggs
it
seemed
to
helen
that
the
bottom
would
drop
out
of
this
structure
of
western
life
she
had
begun
to
build
so
earnestly
and
fearfully
she
did
not
believe
that
he
would
do
so
but
the
uncertainty
was
torturing
dear
bo
appealed
helen
you
do
want
oh
you
do
want
carmichael
to
to
kill
riggs
no
i
do
but
i
would
care
if
he
did
replied
bo
bluntly
do
you
think
he
will
nell
if
that
cowboy
really
loves
me
he
read
my
mind
right
here
before
he
left
declared
bo
and
he
knew
what
i
thought
he
and
what
that
faltered
helen
i
want
him
to
round
riggs
up
down
in
the
village
somewhere
in
a
crowd
i
want
riggs
shown
up
as
the
coward
braggart
that
he
is
and
insulted
slapped
kicked
driven
out
of
pine
her
passionate
speech
still
rang
throughout
the
room
when
there
came
footsteps
on
the
porch
helen
hurried
to
raise
the
bar
from
the
door
and
open
it
just
as
a
tap
sounded
on
the
roy
face
stood
white
out
of
the
darkness
his
eyes
were
bright
and
his
smile
made
fearful
query
needless
how
are
this
evenin
he
drawled
as
he
came
in
a
fire
blazed
on
the
hearth
and
a
lamp
burned
on
the
table
by
their
light
bo
looked
white
and
as
she
reclined
in
the
big
what
he
do
she
asked
with
all
her
amazing
force
wal
now
ai
you
goin
to
tell
me
how
you
are
roy
i
all
bunged
up
i
ought
to
be
in
bed
but
i
just
could
sleep
till
i
hear
what
las
vegas
did
i
forgive
anything
except
him
getting
wal
i
shore
can
ease
your
mind
on
thet
replied
roy
he
never
drank
a
roy
was
distractingly
slow
about
beginning
the
tale
any
child
could
have
guessed
he
was
eager
to
tell
for
once
the
hard
intent
quietness
the
soul
of
labor
pain
and
endurance
so
plain
in
his
face
was
softened
by
pleasurable
emotion
he
poked
at
the
burning
logs
with
the
toe
of
his
boot
helen
observed
that
he
had
changed
his
boots
and
now
wore
no
spurs
then
he
had
gone
to
his
quarters
after
whatever
had
happened
down
in
pine
where
is
he
asked
bo
who
riggs
wal
i
do
know
but
i
reckon
he
somewhere
out
in
the
woods
nursin
not
riggs
first
tell
me
where
he
shore
then
you
must
mean
las
vegas
i
just
left
him
down
at
the
cabin
he
was
gettin
ready
for
bed
early
as
it
is
all
tired
out
he
was
an
thet
white
you
would
have
knowed
him
but
he
looked
happy
at
thet
an
the
last
words
he
said
more
to
himself
than
to
me
i
reckon
was
some
locoed
gent
but
if
she
does
call
me
tom
now
she
no
good
bo
actually
clapped
her
hands
notwithstanding
that
one
of
them
was
bandaged

should
smile
i
will
she
declared
in
delight
hurry
now
what
it
shore
powerful
strange
how
he
hates
thet
handle
las
vegas
went
on
roy
imperturbably
roy
tell

what
he
did
what
tom
did
or
i
scream
cried
bo

roy
appealing
to
helen
no
roy

agreed
helen
but
please
please
tell
us
what
has
roy
grinned
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
a
dark
delight
almost
fiendish
in
its
sudden
revelation
of
a
gulf
of
strange
emotion
deep
within
him
whatever
had
happened
to
riggs
had
not
been
too
much
for
roy
beeman
helen
remembered
hearing
her
uncle
say
that
a
real
westerner
hated
nothing
so
hard
as
the
swaggering
desperado
the
gunman
who
pretended
to
sail
under
the
true
wild
and
reckoning
colors
of
the
west
roy
leaned
his
lithe
tall
form
against
the
stone
mantelpiece
and
faced
the
girls
when
i
rode
out
after
las
vegas
i
seen
him
down
the
road

roy
rapidly
an

then
he
slouches
into
turner
no
more
a
minute
after
las
vegas
rode
down
there
like
a
streak
an
just
as
quick
he
was
off
an
through

roy
paused
as
if
to
gain
force
or
to
choose
his
words
his
tale
now

all
directed
to
bo
who
gazed
at

fascinated
listener
before

tight
about

from

way

every
man

was
afraid
for
his
life
he
was
not
what
he
had
claimed
to
be
i
do
know
if
he
had
any
friends
there
but
in
the
west
good
men
an
bad
men
all
alike
have
no
use
for
riggs
kind
an
thet
stony
quiet
broke
with
haw
haw
it
shore
was
as
pitiful
to
see
riggs
as
it
was
fine
to
see
las
vegas
when
he
dropped
his
arms
then
i
knowed
there
would
be
no
then
las
vegas
got
red
in
the
face
he
slapped
riggs
with
one
hand
then
with
the
other
an
he
began
to
cuss
him
i
shore
never
knowed
thet
las
vegas
carmichael
could
use
such
language
it
was
a
stream
of
the
baddest
names
known
out
here
an
lots
i
never
heard
of
now
an
then
i
caught
somethin
like
an
sneak
an
an
skunk
but
for
the
most
part
they
was
just
the
cussedest
kind
of
names
an
las
vegas
spouted
them
till
he
was
black
in
the
face
an
foamin
at
the
mouth
an
hoarser
a
bawlin
cow
when
he
got
out
of
breath
from
cussin
he
punched
riggs
all
about
the
saloon
threw
him
outdoors
knocked
him
down
an
kicked
him
till
he
got
kickin

down

with
the
whole
gang
behind

he
drove
him
out
of
town
chapter
xviii
for
two
days
bo
was
confined
to
her
bed
suffering
considerable
pain
and
subject
to
fever
during
which
she
talked
irrationally
some
of
this
talk
afforded
helen
as
vast
an
amusement
as
she
was
certain
it
would
have
lifted
tom
carmichael
to
a
seventh
heaven
the
third
day
however
bo
was
better
and
refusing
to
remain
in
bed
she
hobbled
to
the
where
she
divided
her
time
between
staring
out
of
the
window
toward
the
corrals
and
pestering
helen
with
questions
she
tried
to
make
appear
casual
but
helen
saw
through
her
case
and
was
in
a
state
of
glee
what
she
hoped
most
for
was
that
carmichael
would
suddenly
develop
a
little
less
inclination
for
bo
it
was
that
kind
of
treatment
the
young
lady
needed
and
now
was
the
great
opportunity
helen
almost
felt
tempted
to
give
the
cowboy
a
hint
neither
this
day
nor
the
next
however
did
he
put
in
an
appearance
at
the
house
though
helen
saw
him
twice
on
her
rounds
he
was
busy
as
usual
and
greeted
her
as
if
nothing
particular
had
happened
roy
called
twice
once
in
the
afternoon
and
again
during
the
evening
he
grew
more
likable
upon
longer
acquaintance
this
last
visit
he
rendered
bo
speechless
by
teasing
her
about
another
girl
carmichael
was
going
to
take
to
a
dance
bo
face
showed
that
her
vanity
could
not
believe
this
statement
but
that
her
intelligence
of
young
men
credited
it
with
being
possible
roy
evidently
was
as
penetrating
as
he
was
kind
he
made
a
dry
casual
little
remark
about
the
snow
never
melting
on
the
mountains
during
the
latter
part
of
march
and
the
look
with
which
he
accompanied
this
remark
brought
a
blush
to
helen
cheek
after
roy
had
departed
bo
said
to
helen
confound
that
fellow
he
sees
right
through
my
dear
you
rather
transparent
these
days
murmured
helen
you
need
talk
he
gave
you
a
dig
retorted
bo
he
just
knows
you
dying
to
see
the
snow
gracious
i
hope
i
not
so
bad
as
that
of
course
i
want
the
snow
melted
and
spring
to
come
and
flowers
hal
ha
ha
taunted
bo
nell
rayner
do
you
see
any
green
in
my
eyes
spring
to
come
yes
the
poet
said
in
the
spring
a
young
man
fancy
lightly
turns
to
thoughts
of
love
but
that
poet
meant
a
young
helen
gazed
out
of
the
window
at
the
white
stars
nell
have
you
seen
him
since
i
was
hurt
continued
bo
with
an
effort
him
who
oh
whom
do
you
suppose
i
mean
tom
she
responded
and
the
last
word
came
with
a
burst
tom
who
he
ah
you
mean
las
vegas
yes
i
seen
well
did
he
ask
me
i
believe
he
did
ask
how
you
were
something
like
humph
nell
i
do
always
trust
after
that
she
relapsed
into
silence
read
awhile
and
dreamed
awhile
looking
into
the
fire
and
then
she
limped
over
to
kiss
helen
good
night
and
left
the
room
next
day
she
was
rather
quiet
seeming
upon
the
verge
of
one
of
the
dispirited
spells
she
got
infrequently
early
in
the
evening
just
after
the
lights
had
been
lit
and
she
had
joined
helen
in
the
a
familiar
step
sounded
on
the
loose
boards
of
the
porch
helen
went
to
the
door
to
admit
carmichael
he
was
dressed
in
his
dark
suit
which
presented
such
marked
contrast
from
his
and
he
wore
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
nevertheless
despite
all
this
style
he
seemed
more
than
usually
the
cool
easy
careless
cowboy
evenin
miss
helen
he
said
as
he
stalked
in
evenin
miss
bo
how
are
helen
returned
his
greeting
with
a
welcoming
smile
good
evening
tom
said
bo
demurely
that
assuredly
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
called
him
tom
as
she
spoke
she
looked
distractingly
pretty
and
tantalizing
but
if
she
had
calculated
to
floor
carmichael
with
the
initial
wholly
mocking
use
of
his
name
she
had
reckoned
without
cause
the
cowboy
received
that
greeting
as
if
he
had
heard
her
use
it
a
thousand
times
or
had
not
heard
it
at
all
helen
decided
if
he
was
acting
a
part
he
was
certainly
a
clever
actor
he
puzzled
her
somewhat
but
she
liked
his
look
and
his
easy
manner
and
the
something
about
him
that
must
have
been
his
unconscious
sense
of
pride
he
had
gone
far
enough
perhaps
too
far
in
his
overtures
to
bo
how
are
you
feelin
he
asked
i
better
she
replied
with
downcast
eyes
but
i
lame
reckon
that
bronc
piled
you
up
miss
helen
said
there
shore
was
any
joke
about
the
cut
on
your
knee
now
a
fellar
knee
is
a
bad
place
to
hurt
if
he
has
to
keep
on
oh
i
be
well
soon
how
sam
i
hope
he
was
thet
sam
why
he
so
tough
he
never
knowed
he
had
a
tom
i
i
want
to
thank
you
for
giving
riggs
what
he
she
spoke
it
earnestly
eloquently
and
for
once
she
had
no
sly
little
intonation
or
pert
allurement
such
as
was
her
wont
to
use
on
this
infatuated
young
man
aw
you
heard
about
that
replied
carmichael
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
make
light
of
it
nothin
much
it
had
to
be
done
an
shore
i
was
afraid
of
roy
he
been
bad
an
so
would
any
of
the
other
boys
sorta
lookin
out
for
all
of
them
you
know
actin
as
miss
foreman
helen
was
unutterably
tickled
the
effect
of
his
speech
upon
bo
was
stupendous
he
had
disarmed
her
he
had
with
the
finesse
and
tact
and
suavity
of
a
diplomat
removed
himself
from
obligation
and
the
detachment
of
self
the
casual
thing
be
apparently
made
out
of
his
magnificent
championship
was
bewildering
and
humiliating
to
bo
she
sat
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
while
helen
tried
to
fit
easily
into
the
conversation
it
was
not
likely
that
bo
would
long
be
at
a
loss
for
words
and
also
it
was
immensely
probable
that
with
a
flash
of
her
wonderful
spirit
she
would
turn
the
tables
on
her
perverse
lover
in
a
twinkling
anyway
plain
it
was
that
a
lesson
had
sunk
deep
she
looked
startled
hurt
wistful
and
finally
sweetly
defiant
but
you
told
riggs
i
was
your
girl
thus
bo
unmasked
her
battery
and
helen
could
not
imagine
how
carmichael
would
ever
resist
that
and
the
soft
arch
glance
which
accompanied
it
helen
did
not
yet
know
the
cowboy
any
more
than
did
bo
shore
i
had
to
say
thet
i
had
to
make
it
strong
before
thet
gang
i
reckon
it
was
presumin
of
me
an
i
shore
bo
stared
at
him
and
then
giving
a
little
gasp
she
drooped
wal
i
just
run
in
to
say
howdy
an
to
inquire
after
said
carmichael
i
goin
to
the
dance
an
as
flo
lives
out
of
town
a
ways
i
shore
better
rustle
good
night
miss
bo
i
hope
you
be
sam
soon
an
good
night
miss
bo
roused
to
a
very
friendly
and
laconic
little
speech
much
overdone
carmichael
strode
out
and
helen
bidding
him
closed
the
door
after
him
the
instant
he
had
departed
bo
transformation
was
tragic
flo
he
meant
flo
stubbs
that
ugly
bold
little
frump
bo
expostulated
helen
the
young
lady
is
not
beautiful
i
grant
but
she
very
nice
and
pleasant
i
liked
nell
rayner
men
are
no
good
and
cowboys
are
the
worst
declared
bo
terribly
why
did
you
appreciate
tom
when
you
had
him
asked
helen
bo
had
been
growing
furious
but
now
the
allusion
in
past
tense
to
the
conquest
she
had
suddenly
and
amazingly
found
dear
quite
broke
her
spirit
it
was
a
very
pale
unsteady
and
miserable
girl
who
avoided
helen
gaze
and
left
the
room
next
day
bo
was
not
approachable
from
any
direction
helen
found
her
a
victim
to
a
multiplicity
of
moods
ranging
from
woe
to
dire
dark
broodings
from
them
to
wistfulness
and
at
last
to
a
pride
that
sustained
her
late
in
the
afternoon
at
helen
leisure
hour
when
she
and
bo
were
in
the
horses
tramped
into
the
court
and
footsteps
mounted
the
porch
opening
to
a
loud
knock
helen
was
surprised
to
see
beasley
and
out
in
the
court
were
several
mounted
horsemen
helen
heart
sank
this
visit
indeed
had
been
foreshadowed
afternoon
miss
rayner
said
beasley
doffing
his
sombrero
called
on
a
little
business
deal
will
you
see
me
helen
acknowledged
his
greeting
while
she
thought
rapidly
she
might
just
as
well
see
him
and
have
that
inevitable
interview
done
with
come
in
she
said
and
when
he
had
entered
she
closed
the
door
my
sister
how
d
you
do
miss
said
the
rancher
in
bluff
loud
voice
bo
acknowledged
the
introduction
with
a
frigid
little
bow
at
close
range
beasley
seemed
a
forceful
personality
as
well
as
a
rather
handsome
man
of
perhaps
heavy
of
build
swarthy
of
skin
and
of
eye
like
that
of
the
mexicans
whose
blood
was
reported
to
be
in
him
he
looked
crafty
confident
and
if
helen
had
never
heard
of
him
before
that
visit
she
would
have
distrusted
him
i
called
sooner
but
i
was
waitin
for
old
jose
the
mexican
who
herded
for
me
when
i
was
pardner
to
your
uncle
said
beasley
and
he
sat
down
to
put
his
huge
gloved
hands
on
his
knees
yes
queried
helen
interrogatively
jose
rustled
over
from
magdalena
an
now
i
can
back
up
my
claim
miss
rayner
this
hyar
ranch
ought
to
be
mine
an
is
mine
it
was
so
big
or
so
well
stocked
when
al
auchincloss
beat
me
out
of
it
i
reckon
i
allow
for
thet
i
papers
an
old
jose
for
witness
an
i
calculate
you
pay
me
eighty
thousand
dollars
or
else
i
take
over
the
beasley
spoke
in
an
ordinary
tone
that
certainly
seemed
sincere
and
his
manner
was
blunt
but
perfectly
natural
mr
beasley
your
claim
is
no
news
to
me
responded
helen
quietly
i
heard
about
it
and
i
questioned
my
uncle
he
swore
on
his
that
he
did
not
owe
you
a
dollar
indeed
he
claimed
the
indebtedness
was
yours
to
him
i
could
find
nothing
in
his
papers
so
i
must
repudiate
your
claim
i
will
not
take
it
miss
rayner
i
ca
blame
you
for
takin
al
word
against
mine
said
beasley
an
your
stand
is
natural
but
you
a
stranger
here
an
you
know
nothin
of
stock
deals
in
these
ranges
it
ai
fair
to
speak
bad
of
the
dead
but
the
truth
is
thet
al
auchincloss
got
his
start
by
stealin
sheep
an
unbranded
cattle
thet
was
the
start
of
every
rancher
i
know
it
was
mine
an
we
none
of
us
ever
thought
of
it
as
helen
could
only
stare
her
surprise
and
doubt
at
this
statement
talk
cheap
anywhere
an
in
the
west
talk
ai
much
at
all
continued
beasley
i
no
talker
i
jest
want
to
tell
my
case
an
make
a
deal
if
you
have
it
i
can
prove
more
in
black
an
white
an
with
witness
than
you
can
thet
my
case
the
deal
i
make
is
this
let
marry
an
settle
a
bad
deal
thet
the
man
direct
assumption
absolutely
without
a
qualifying
consideration
for
her
woman
attitude
was
amazing
ignorant
and
base
but
helen
was
so
well
prepared
for
it
that
she
hid
her
disgust
thank
you
beasley
but
i
ca
accept
your
offer
she
replied
would
you
take
time
an
consider
he
asked
spreading
wide
his
huge
gloved
hands
absolutely
beasley
rose
to
his
feet
he
showed
no
disappointment
or
chagrin
but
the
bold
pleasantness
left
his
face
and
slight
as
that
change
was
it
stripped
him
of
the
only
redeeming
quality
he
showed
thet
means
i
force
you
to
pay
me
the
eighty
thousand
or
put
you
off
he
said
mr
beasley
even
if
i
owed
you
that
how
could
i
raise
so
enormous
a
sum
i
do
owe
it
and
i
certainly
wo
be
put
off
my
property
you
ca
put
me
an
why
ca
i
he
demanded
with
lowering
dark
gaze
because
your
claim
is
dishonest
and
i
can
prove
it
declared
helen
forcibly
who
you
goin
to
prove
it
to
thet
i
dishonest
to
my
men
to
your
men
to
the
people
of
pine
to
everybody
not
a
person
who
wo
believe
he
seemed
curious
discomfited
surlily
annoyed
and
yet
fascinated
by
her
statement
or
else
by
the
quality
and
appearance
of
her
as
she
spiritedly
defended
her
cause
an
how
you
goin
to
prove
all
thet
he
growled
mr
beasley
do
you
remember
last
fall
when
you
met
snake
anson
with
his
gang
up
in
the
woods
and
hired
him
to
make
off
with
me
asked
helen
in
swift
ringing
words
the
dark
olive
of
beasley
bold
face
shaded
to
a
dirty
white
he
jerked
out
hoarsely
i
see
you
remember
well
milt
dale
was
hidden
in
the
loft
of
that
cabin
where
you
met
anson
he
heard
every
word
of
your
deal
with
the
beasley
swung
his
arm
in
sudden
violence
so
hard
that
he
flung
his
glove
to
the
floor
as
he
stooped
to
snatch
it
up
he
uttered
a
sibilant
hiss
then
stalking
to
the
door
he
jerked
it
open
and
slammed
it
behind
him
his
loud
voice
hoarse
with
passion
preceded
the
scrape
and
crack
of
hoofs
shortly
after
supper
that
day
when
helen
was
just
recovering
her
composure
carmichael
presented
himself
at
the
open
door
bo
was
not
there
in
the
dimming
twilight
helen
saw
that
the
cowboy
was
pale
somber
grim
oh
what
happened
cried
helen
roy
been
shot
it
come
off
in
turner
saloon
but
he
ai
dead
we
packed
him
over
to
widow
cass
an
he
said
for
me
to
tell
you
pull
shot
pull
through
repeated
helen
in
slow
unrealizing
exclamation
she
was
conscious
of
a
deep
internal
tumult
and
a
cold
checking
of
blood
in
all
her
external
body
yes
shot
replied
carmichael
fiercely
an
whatever
he
says
i
reckon
he
wo
pull
o
heaven
how
terrible
burst
out
helen
he
was
so
good
such
a
man
what
a
pity
oh
he
must
have
met
that
in
my
behalf
tell
me
what
happened
who
shot
him
wal
i
do
know
an
thet
what
made
me
hoppin
mad
i
there
when
it
come
off
an
he
wo
tell
why
not
i
do
know
thet
either
i
reckoned
first
it
was
because
he
wanted
to
get
even
but
after
thinkin
it
over
i
guess
he
does
want
me
lookin

for
fear
i
might
get
hurt
an
you
to
need

all
i
can
make
of
then
helen
hurriedly
related
the
event
of
beasley
call
on
her
that
afternoon
and
all
that
had
occurred
wal
the
ejaculated
carmichael
in
utter
confoundment
he
wanted
you
to
marry
him
he
certainly
did
i
must
say
it
was
a
a
rather
abrupt
carmichael
appeared
to
be
laboring
with
speech
that
had
to
be
smothered
behind
his
teeth
at
last
he
let
out
an
explosive
breath
miss
nell
i
shore
felt
in
my
bones
thet
i
the
boy
slated
to
brand
thet
big
oh
he
must
have
shot
roy
he
left
here
in
a
i
reckon
you
can
coax
it
out
of
roy
fact
is
all
i
could
learn
was
thet
roy
come
in
the
saloon
alone
beasley
was
there
an
riggs
riggs
interrupted
helen
shore
riggs
he
come
back
again
but
he
better
keep
out
of
my
way
an
jeff
mulvey
with
his
outfit

told
me
he
heard
an
argument
an
then
a
shot
the
gang
cleared
out
leavin
roy
on
the
floor
i
come
in
a
little
later

wal
i
got
help
an
packed

cass
roy
seemed
all
right
but
he
was
too
bright
an
talky
to
suit
me
the
bullet
hit
his
lung
thet
shore
an
he
lost
a
sight
of
blood
before
we
stopped
it
thet
skunk
turner
might
have
lent
a
hand
an
if
roy
croaks
i
reckon
i
tom
why
must
you
always
be
reckoning
to
kill
somebody
demanded
helen
angrily
somebody

to
be
killed
here
thet
why
he
snapped
back
even
so
should
you
risk
leaving
bo
and
me
without
a
friend
asked
helen
reproachfully
at
that
carmichael
wavered
and
lost
something
of
his
sullen
deadliness
aw
miss
nell
i
only
mad
if
you
just
be
patient
with
me
mebbe
coax
me
but

next
morning
carmichael
drove
helen
and
bo
into
pine
and
tied
up
the
team
before
widow
cass
cottage
the
peach
and
were
mingling
blossoms
of
pink
and
white
a
drowsy
hum
of
bees
filled
the
fragrant
air
rich
alfalfa
covered
the
small
orchard
flat
a
wood
fire
sent
up
a
lazy
column
of
blue
smoke
and
birds
were
singing
sweetly
helen
could
scarcely
believe
that
amid
all
this
tranquillity
a
man
lay
perhaps
fatally
injured
assuredly
carmichael
had
been
somber
and
reticent
enough
to
rouse
the
gravest
fears
widow
cass
appeared
on
the
little
porch
a
gray
bent
worn
but
cheerful
old
woman
whom
helen
had
come
to
know
as
her
friend

land
i
thet
glad
to
see
you
miss

an

little
lass

helen
anxiously
scanning
the
wrinkled
face

hoss
an
ride

them
mormons
she
led
them
into
a
little
where
on
a
couch
underneath
a
window
roy
beeman
lay
he
was
wide
awake
and
smiling
but
haggard
he
lay
partly
covered
with
a
blanket
his
gray
shirt
was
open
at
the
neck
disclosing
bandages
mornin
girls
he
drawled
shore
is
good
of
you
now
comin
helen
stood
beside
him
bent
over
him
in
her
earnestness
as
she
greeted
him
she
saw
a
shade
of
pain
in
his
eyes
and
his
immobility
struck
her
but
he
did
not
seem
badly
off
bo
was
pale
and
apparently
too
agitated
to
speak
carmichael
placed
chairs
beside
the
couch
for
the
girls
wal
what
ailin
you
this
nice
mornin
asked
roy
eyes
on
the
cowboy
huh
would
you
expect
me
to
be
wearin
the
smile
of
a
fellar
goin
to
be
married
retorted
carmichael
shore
you
have
made
up
with
bo
yet
returned
roy
bo
blushed
rosy
red
and
the
cowboy
face
lost
something
of
its
somber
hue
i
allow
it
none
of
your
d
darn
bizness
if
she
ai
made
up
with
me
he
said
las
vegas
you
a
wonder
with
a
hoss
an
a
rope
an
i
reckon
with
a
gun
but
when
it
comes
to
girls
you
shore
ai
i
no
mormon
by
golly
come
ma
cass
let
get
out
of
here
so
they
can
folks
i
was
jest
to
say
thet
roy
got
fever
an
he
t
talk
too
much
said
the
old
woman
then
she
and
carmichael
went
into
the
kitchen
and
closed
the
door
roy
looked
up
at
helen
with
his
keen
eyes
more
kindly
piercing
than
ever
my
brother
john
was
here
he
just
left
when
you
come
he
rode
home
to
tell
my
folks
i
not
so
bad
hurt
an
then
he
goin
to
ride
a
into
the
helen
eyes
asked
what
her
lips
refused
to
utter
he
goin
after
dale
i
sent
him
i
reckoned
sorta
needed
sight
of
thet
doggone
roy
had
averted
his
gaze
quickly
to
bo
do
you
agree
with
me
lass
i
sure
do
replied
bo
heartily
all
within
helen
had
been
stilled
for
the
moment
of
her
realization
and
then
came
swell
and
beat
of
heart
and
inconceivable
chafing
of
a
tide
at
its
restraint
can
john
fetch
dale
out
when
the
snow
so
deep
she
asked
unsteadily
shore
he
takin
two
hosses
up
to
the
then
if
necessary
he
go
over
the
pass
on
but
i
bet
him
dale
would
ride
out
snow
about
gone
except
on
the
north
slopes
an
on
the
then
when
may
i
we
expect
to
see
dale
three
or
four
days
i
reckon
i
wish
he
was
here
now
miss
helen
there
trouble
i
realize
that
i
ready
did
las
vegas
tell
you
about
beasley
visit
to
me
no
you
tell
me
replied
roy
briefly
helen
began
to
acquaint
him
with
the
circumstances
of
that
visit
and
before
she
had
finished
she
made
sure
roy
was
swearing
to
himself
he
asked
you
to
marry
him
jerusalem
thet
i
never
have
reckoned
the
coyote
of
a
greaser
wal
miss
helen
when
i
met
up
with
senor
beasley
last
night
he
was
shore
spoilin
from
somethin
now
i
see
what
thet
was
an
i
reckon
i
picked
out
the
bad
for
what
roy
what
did
you
do
wal
i
made
up
my
mind
awhile
back
to
talk
to
beasley
the
first
chance
i
had
an
thet
was
it
i
was
in
the
store
when
i
seen
him
go
into
turner
so
i
followed
it
was
dark
beasley
an
riggs
mulvey
an
some
more
were
drinkin
an
powwowin
so
i
just
braced
him
right
roy
oh
the
way
you
boys
court
danger
but
miss
helen
thet
the
only
way
to
be
afraid
makes
more
danger
beasley
civil
enough
first
off
him
an
me
kept
edgin
off
an
his
pards
kept
edgin
after
us
till
we
got
over
in
a
corner
of
the
saloon
i
do
know
all
i
said
to
him
shore
i
talked
a
heap
i
told
him
what
my
old
man
thought
an
beasley
knowed
as
well
as
i
thet
my
old
man
not
only
the
oldest
inhabitant
hereabouts
but
he
the
wisest
too
an
he
would
tell
a
lie
wal
i
used
all
his
sayin
in
my
argument
to
show
beasley
thet
if
he
did
haul
up
short
he
end
almost
as
short
beasley
an
powerful
conceited
vain
as
a
peacock
he
could
see
an
he
got
mad
i
told
him
he
was
rich
enough
without
robbin
you
of
your
ranch
an
wal
i
shore
put
up
a
big
talk
for
your
side
by
this
time
he
an
his
gang
had
me
crowded
in
a
corner
an
from
their
looks
i
begun
to
get
cold
feet
but
i
was
in
it
an
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
the
argument
worked
down
to
his
pinnin
me
to
my
word
that
i
fight
for
you
when
thet
fight
come
off
an
i
shore
told
him
for
my
own
sake
i
wished
it
come
off
quick
then
wal
then
somethin
did
come
off
quick
roy
then
he
shot
you
exclaimed
helen
passionately
now
miss
helen
i
did
say
who
done
it
replied
roy
with
his
engaging
smile
tell
me
then
who
did
wal
i
reckon
i
tell
you
unless
you
promise
not
to
tell
las
vegas
thet
cowboy
is
plumb
off
his
head
he
thinks
he
knows
who
shot
me
an
i
been
lyin
somethin
scandalous
you
see
if
he
learns
then
he
go
gunnin
an
miss
helen
thet
texan
is
bad
he
might
get
plugged
as
i
did
an
there
would
be
another
man
put
off
your
side
when
the
big
trouble
roy
i
promise
you
i
will
not
tell
las
vegas
replied
helen
earnestly
wal
then
it
was
riggs
roy
grew
still
paler
as
he
confessed
this
and
his
voice
almost
a
whisper
expressed
shame
and
hate
thet
did
it
shot
me
from
behind
beasley
i
had
no
chance
i
could
even
see
him
draw
but
when
i
fell
an
lay
there
an
the
others
dropped
back
then
i
seen
the
smokin
gun
in
his
hand
he
looked
powerful
important
an
beasley
began
to
cuss
him
an
was
cussin
him
as
they
all
run
oh
coward
the
despicable
coward
cried
helen
no
wonder
tom
wants
to
find
out
exclaimed
bo
low
and
deep
i
bet
he
suspects
shore
he
does
but
i
would
give
him
no
roy
you
know
that
riggs
ca
last
out
wal
i
hope
he
lasts
till
i
get
on
my
feet
there
you
go
hopeless
all
you
boys
you
must
spill
blood
murmured
helen
shudderingly
dear
miss
helen
do
take
on
so
i
like
dale
no
man
to
hunt
up
trouble
but
out
here
there
a
sort
of
unwritten
law
an
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
i
believe
in
god
almighty
an
killin
is
against
my
religion
but
riggs
shot
me
the
same
as
shootin
me
in
the
roy
i
only
a
woman
i
fear
and
unequal
to
this
wait
till
somethin
happens
to
you
beasley
comes
an
grabs
you
with
his
own
dirty
big
paws
an
after
maulin
you
some
throws
you
out
of
your
home
or
supposin
riggs
chases
you
into
a
corner
helen
felt
the
start
of
all
her
physical
being
a
violent
leap
of
blood
but
she
could
only
judge
of
her
looks
from
the
grim
smile
of
the
wounded
man
as
he
watched
her
with
his
keen
intent
eyes
my
friend
anythin
can
happen
he
said
but
let
hope
it
wo
be
the
he
had
begun
to
show
signs
of
weakness
and
helen
rising
at
once
said
that
she
and
bo
had
better
leave
him
then
but
would
come
to
see
him
the
next
day
at
her
call
carmichael
entered
again
with
cass
and
after
a
few
remarks
the
visit
was
terminated
carmichael
lingered
in
the
doorway
wal
cheer
up
you
old
mormon
he
called
cheer
up
yourself
you
cross
old
bachelor
retorted
roy
quite
unnecessarily
loud
ca
you
raise
enough
nerve
to
make
up
with
bo
carmichael
evacuated
the
doorway
as
if
he
had
been
spurred
he
was
quite
red
in
the
face
while
he
unhitched
the
team
and
silent
during
the
ride
up
to
the
there
he
got
down
and
followed
the
girls
into
the
sitting
room
he
appeared
still
somber
though
not
sullen
and
had
fully
regained
his
composure
did
you
find
out
who
shot
roy
he
asked
abruptly
of
helen
yes
but
i
promised
roy
i
would
not
tell
replied
helen
nervously
she
averted
her
eyes
from
his
searching
gaze
intuitively
fearing
his
next
query
was
it
thet
riggs
las
vegas
do
ask
me
i
will
not
break
my
he
strode
to
the
window
and
looked
out
a
moment
and
presently
when
he
turned
toward
bo
he
seemed
a
stronger
loftier
more
impelling
man
with
all
his
emotions
under
control
bo
will
you
listen
to
me
if
i
swear
to
speak
the
truth
as
i
know

replied
bo
with
the
color
coming
swiftly
to
her
face
roy
does
want
me
to
know
because
he
wants
to
meet
thet
fellar
himself
an
i
want
to
know
because

but
he
ca

here
for
some
days
an
thet
gang

got
to
be
bluffed
you

to
see
this
i
reckon

quick
in
savvyin
western
ways
i
could
pay
you
no
higher
compliment
bo
rayner
now
will
you
tell

replied
bo
with
the
blaze
leaping
to
her
eyes
oh
bo
please
do
please
do
wait
implored
helen
bo
it
between
you
an
me
said
carmichael
tom
i
tell
you
whispered
bo
it
was
a
lowdown
cowardly
trick
roy
was
surrounded
and
shot
from
behind
beasley
by
that
riggs
chapter
xix
the
memory
of
a
woman
had
ruined
milt
dale
peace
had
confounded
his
philosophy
of
lonely
happiness
in
the
solitude
of
the
wilds
had
forced
him
to
come
face
to
face
with
his
soul
and
the
fatal
significance
of
life
when
he
realized
his
defeat
that
things
were
not
as
they
seemed
that
there
was
no
joy
for
him
in
the
coming
of
spring
that
he
had
been
blind
in
his
free
sensorial
indian
relation
to
existence
he
fell
into
an
inexplicably
strange
state
a
despondency
a
gloom
as
deep
as
the
silence
of
his
home
dale
reflected
that
the
stronger
an
animal
the
keener
its
nerves
the
higher
its
intelligence
the
greater
must
be
its
suffering
under
restraint
or
injury
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
high
order
of
animal
whose
great
physical
need
was
action
and
now
the
incentive
to
action
seemed
dead
he
grew
lax
he
did
not
want
to
move
he
performed
his
diminishing
duties
under
compulsion
he
watched
for
spring
as
a
liberation
but
not
that
he
could
leave
the
valley
he
hated
the
cold
he
grew
weary
of
wind
and
snow
he
imagined
the
warm
sun
the
park
once
more
green
with
grass
and
bright
with
daisies
the
return
of
birds
and
squirrels
and
deer
to
heir
old
haunts
would
be
the
means
whereby
he
could
break
this
spell
upon
him
then
he
might
gradually
return
to
past
contentment
though
it
would
never
be
the
same
but
spring
coming
early
to
paradise
park
brought
a
fever
to
blood
a
fire
of
unutterable
longing
it
was
good
perhaps
that
this
was
so
because
he
seemed
driven
to
work
climb
tramp
and
keep
ceaselessly
on
the
move
from
dawn
till
dark
action
strengthened
his
lax
muscles
and
kept
him
from
those
motionless
senseless
hours
of
brooding
he
at
least
need
not
be
ashamed
of
longing
for
that
which
could
never
be
his
the
sweetness
of
a
woman
a
home
full
of
light
joy
hope
the
meaning
and
beauty
of
children
but
those
dark
moods
were
sinkings
into
a
pit
of
hell
dale
had
not
kept
track
of
days
and
weeks
he
did
not
know
when
the
snow
melted
off
three
slopes
of
paradise
park
all
he
knew
was
that
an
age
had
dragged
over
his
head
and
that
spring
had
come
during
his
restless
waking
hours
and
even
when
he
was
asleep
there
seemed
always
in
the
back
of
his
mind
a
growing
consciousness
that
soon
he
would
emerge
from
this
trial
a
changed
man
ready
to
sacrifice
his
chosen
lot
to
give
up
his
lonely
life
of
selfish
indulgence
in
lazy
affinity
with
nature
and
to
go
wherever
his
strong
hands
might
perform
some
real
service
to
people
nevertheless
he
wanted
to
linger
in
this
mountain
fastness
until
his
ordeal
was
over
until
he
could
meet
her
and
the
world
knowing
himself
more
of
a
man
than
ever
before
one
bright
morning
while
he
was
at
his
the
tame
cougar
gave
a
low
growling
warning
dale
was
startled
tom
did
not
act
like
that
because
of
a
prowling
grizzly
or
a
straying
stag
presently
dale
espied
a
horseman
riding
slowly
out
of
the
straggling
spruces
and
with
that
sight
dale
heart
gave
a
leap
recalling
to
him
a
divination
of
his
future
relation
to
his
kind
never
had
he
been
so
glad
to
see
a
man
this
visitor
resembled
one
of
the
beemans
judging
from
the
way
he
sat
his
horse
and
presently
dale
recognized
him
to
be
john
at
this
juncture
the
jaded
horse
was
spurred
into
a
trot
soon
reaching
the
pines
and
the
camp
howdy
there
you
ole
called
john
waving
his
hand
for
all
his
hearty
greeting
his
appearance
checked
a
like
response
from
dale
the
horse
was
mud
to
his
flanks
and
john
was
mud
to
his
knees
wet
bedraggled
worn
and
white
this
hue
of
his
face
meant
more
than
fatigue
howdy
john
replied
dale
they
shook
hands
john
wearily
swung
his
leg
over
the
pommel
but
did
not
at
once
dismount
his
clear
gray
eyes
were
wonderingly
riveted
upon
the
hunter
milt
what
hell
wrong
he
queried
why

me
if

i

dale
soberly
as
he
laid
a

his
heart

john
with
thet
chest
an
up
in
this
air

out

dale

drooping
beast
then
began
to
unsaddle

done

bogged

thet

big
strong
hosses

what

queried
dale
sharply
he
dropped
a
stick
of
wood
and
straightened
up
from
the
you
goin
to
ride
down
to
pine
with
me
thet
what
familiarly
then
came
back
to
dale
the
quiet
intent
suggestiveness
of
the
beemans
in
moments
foreboding
trial
at
this
certain
assurance
of
john
too
significant
to
be
doubted
dale
thought
of
pine
gave
slow
birth
to
a
strange
sensation
as
if
he
had
been
dead
and
was
vibrating
back
to
life
tell
what
you
got
to
tell
he
broke
out
quick
as
a
flash
the
mormon
replied
roy

shot
but
he
wo
die
he
sent
for
you
bad
deal
afoot
beasley
means
to
force
helen
rayner
out
an
steal
her
a
tremor
ran
all
through
dale
it
seemed
another
painful
yet
thrilling
connection
between
his
past
and
this
vaguely
calling
future
his
emotions
had
been
broodings
dreams
longings
this
thing
his
friend
said
had
the
sting
of
real
life
then
old
al
dead

asked
long
ago

reckon
around
the
middle
of
february

a
pity

declared
dale
how

his

sounded
to
his

hoarse
and
unreal
as

beasley

an

as
he
swallowed
hard
now
just
what
was
roy
message
to
me
wal
i
ca
remember
all
roy

answered
john
dubiously
but
roy
shore
was
excited
an
dead
in
earnest

says

him

in
more
danger
than

the
mountains
toward
paradise
park
with
her
heart
in
her
eyes
tell
him
she
needs
him
most
of
all
dale
shook
all
over
as
with
an
attack
of
ague
he
was
seized
by
a
whirlwind
of
passionate
terrible
sweetness
of
sensation
when
what
he
wildly
wanted
was
to
curse
roy
and
john
for
their
conclusions
roy
crazy
panted
dale
wal
now
milt
thet
downright
surprisin
of
you

exclaimed
john
feelingly
thet
the
hell
of
life
never
knowin
but
here
it
joy
for
you
you
can
believe
roy
beeman
about
women
as
quick
as
you
trust
him
to
track

lost

an
you

life
thet
true
an
he
said
it
because
he
means
you
to
rustle
down
there
an
fight
for
thet
i
go
said
dale
in
a
shaky
whisper
as
he
sat
down
on
a
pine
log
near
the
fire
he
stared
unseeingly
at
the
bluebells
in
the
grass
by
his
feet
while
storm
after
storm
possessed
his
breast
they
were
fierce
and
brief
because
driven
by
his
will
in
those
few
moments
of
contending
strife
dale
was
immeasurably
removed
from
that
dark
gulf
of
self
which
had
made
his
winter
a
nightmare
and
when
he
stood
erect
again
it
seemed
that
the
old
earth
had
a
stirring
electrifying
impetus
for
his
feet
something
black
bitter
melancholy
and
morbid
always
unreal
to
him
had
passed
away
forever
the
great
moment
had
been
forced
upon
him
he
did
not
believe
roy
beeman
preposterous
hint
regarding
helen
but
he
had
gone
back
or
soared
onward
as
if
by
magic
to
his
old
true
self
mounted
on
dale
strongest
horses
with
only
a
light
pack
an
ax
and
their
weapons
the
two
men
had
reached
the
on
the
pass
by
noon
that
day
tom
the
tame
cougar
trotted
along
in
the
rear
the
crust
of
the
snow
now
half
thawed
by
the
sun
would
not
hold
the
weight
of
a
horse
though
it
upheld
the
men
on
foot
they
walked
leading
the
horses
travel
was
not
difficult
until
the
snow
began
to
deepen
then
progress
slackened
materially
john
had
not
been
able
to
pick
out
the
line
of
the
trail
so
dale
did
not
follow
his
tracks
an
old
blaze
on
the
trees
enabled
dale
to
keep
fairly
well
to
the
trail
and
at
length
the
height
of
the
pass
was
reached
where
the
snow
was
deep
here
the
horses
labored
plowing
through
foot
by
foot
when
finally
they
sank
to
their
flanks
they
had
to
be
dragged
and
goaded
on
and
helped
by
thick
flat
bunches
of
spruce
boughs
placed
under
their
hoofs
it
took
three
hours
of
breaking
toil
to
do
the
few
hundred
yards
of
deep
snow
on
the
height
of
the
pass
the
cougar
did
not
have
great
difficulty
in
following
though
it
was
evident
he
did
not
like
such
traveling
that
behind
them
the
horses
gathered
heart
and
worked
on
to
the
edge
of
the
steep
descent
where
they
had
all
they
could
do
to
hold
back
from
sliding
and
rolling
fast
time
was
made
on
this
slope
at
the
bottom
of
which
began
a
dense
forest
with
snow
still
deep
in
places
and
windfalls
hard
to
locate
the
men
here
performed
herculean
labors
but
they
got
through
to
a
park
where
the
snow
was
gone
the
ground
however
soft
and
boggy
in
places
was
more
treacherous
than
the
snow
and
the
travelers
had
to
skirt
the
edge
of
the
park
to
a
point
opposite
and
then
go
on
through
the
forest
when
they
reached
bare
and
solid
ground
just
before
dark
that
night
it
was
high
time
for
the
horses
were
ready
to
drop
and
the
men
likewise
camp
was
made
in
an
open
wood
darkness
fell
and
the
men
were
resting
on
bough
beds
feet
to
the
fire
with
tom
curled
up
close
by
and
the
horses
still
drooping
where
they
had
been
unsaddled
morning
however
discovered
them
grazing
on
the
long
bleached
grass
john
shook
his
head
when
he
looked
at
them
you
reckoned
to
make
pine
by
nightfall
how
far
is
it
the
way
go
fifty
mile
or
thereabouts
replied
dale
wal
we
ca
ride
it
on
them
john
we
do
more
than
that
if
we
had
they
were
saddled
and
on
the
move
before
sunrise
leaving
snow
and
bog
behind
level
parks
and
level
forests
led
one
after
another
to
long
slopes
and
steep
descents
all
growing
sunnier
and
greener
as
the
altitude
diminished
squirrels
and
grouse
turkeys
and
deer
and
less
tame
denizens
of
the
forest
grew
more
abundant
as
the
travel
advanced
in
this
game
zone
however
dale
had
trouble
with
tom
the
cougar
had
to
be
watched
and
called
often
to
keep
him
off
of
trails
tom
does
like
a
long
trip
said
dale
but
i
goin
to
take
him
some
way
or
other
he
may
come
in
sic
him
onto
beasley
gang
replied
john
some
men
are
powerful
scared
of
cougars
but
i
never
nor
me
though
i
had
cougars
give
me
a
darn
uncanny
the
men
talked
but
little
dale
led
the
way
with
tom
trotting
noiselessly
beside
his
horse
john
followed
close
behind
they
loped
the
horses
across
parks
trotted
through
the
forests
walked
slow
up
what
few
inclines
they
met
and
slid
down
the
soft
wet
descents
so
they
averaged
from
six
to
eight
miles
an
hour
the
horses
held
up
well
under
that
steady
travel
and
this
without
any
rest
at
noon
dale
seemed
to
feel
himself
in
an
emotional
trance
yet
despite
this
the
same
old
sensorial
perceptions
crowded
thick
and
fast
upon
him
strangely
sweet
and
vivid
after
the
past
dead
months
when
neither
sun
nor
wind
nor
cloud
nor
scent
of
pine
nor
anything
in
nature
could
stir
him
his
mind
his
heart
his
soul
seemed
steeped
in
an
intoxicating
wine
of
expectation
while
his
eyes
and
ears
and
nose
had
never
been
keener
to
register
the
facts
of
the
he
saw
the
black
thing
far
ahead
that
resembled
a
burned
stump
but
he
knew
was
a
bear
before
it
vanished
he
saw
gray
flash
of
deer
and
wolf
and
coyote
and
the
red
of
fox
and
the
small
wary
heads
of
old
gobblers
just
sticking
above
the
grass
and
he
saw
deep
tracks
of
game
as
well
as
the
blades
of
bluebells
where
some
beast
had
just
trod
and
he
heard
the
melancholy
notes
of
birds
the
twitter
of
grouse
the
sough
of
the
wind
the
light
dropping
of
the
near
and
distant
bark
of
squirrels
the
deep
gobble
of
a
turkey
close
at
hand
and
the
challenge
from
a
rival
far
away
the
cracking
of
twigs
in
the
thickets
the
murmur
of
running
water
the
scream
of
an
eagle
and
the
shrill
cry
of
a
hawk
and
always
the
soft
dull
steady
pads
of
the
hoofs
of
the
horses
the
smells
too
were
the
sweet
stinging
ones
of
spring
warm
and
pleasant
the
odor
of
the
clean
fresh
earth
cutting
its
way
through
that
thick
strong
fragrance
of
pine
the
smell
of
logs
rotting
in
the
sun
and
of
fresh
new
grass
and
flowers
along
a
brook
of
i
smell
smoke
said
dale
suddenly
as
he
reined
in
and
turned
for
corroboration
from
his
companion
john
sniffed
the
warm
air
wal
you
more
of
an
injun
than
me
he
replied
shaking
his
head
they
traveled
on
and
presently
came
out
upon
the
rim
of
the
last
slope
a
long
league
of
green
slanted
below
them
breaking
up
into
straggling
lines
of
trees
and
groves
that
joined
the
cedars
and
these
in
turn
stretched
on
and
down
in
patches
to
the
desert
that
glittering
and
bare
with
streaks
of
somber
hue
faded
in
the
obscurity
of
distance
the
village
of
pine
appeared
to
nestle
in
a
curve
of
the
edge
of
the
great
forest
and
the
cabins
looked
like
tiny
white
dots
set
in
green
look
there
said
dale
pointing
some
miles
to
the
right
a
gray
escarpment
of
rock
cropped
out
of
the
slope
forming
a
promontory
and
from
it
a
thin
pale
column
of
smoke
curled
upward
to
be
lost
from
sight
as
soon
as
it
had
no
background
of
green
thet
your
smoke
shore
enough
replied
john
thoughtfully
now
i
jest
wonder
who
campin
there
no
water
near
or
grass
for
john
that
point
been
used
for
smoke
signals
many
a
was
jest
thinkin
of
thet
same
shall
we
ride
around
there
an
take
a
peek
no
but
we
remember
that
if
beasley
got
his
deep
scheme
goin
he
have
snake
anson
gang
somewhere
roy
said
thet
same
wal
it
some
three
hours
till
sundown
the
hosses
keep
up
i
reckon
i
fooled
for
we
make
pine
all
right
but
old
tom
there
he
tired
or
the
big
cougar
was
lying
down
panting
and
his
eyes
were
on
dale
tom
only
lazy
an
fat
he
could
travel
at
this
gait
for
a
week
but
let
rest
a
an
watch
that
smoke
before
movin
on
we
can
make
pine
before
when
travel
had
been
resumed
down
the
slope
dale
sharp
eyes
caught
a
broad
track
where
shod
horses
had
passed
climbing
in
a
long
slant
toward
the
promontory
he
dismounted
to
examine
it
and
john
coming
up
proceeded
with
alacrity
to
get
off
and
do
likewise
dale
made
his
deductions
after
which
he
stood
in
a
brown
study
beside
his
horse
waiting
for
john
wal
what
you
make
of
these
here
tracks
asked
that
worthy
some
horses
an
a
pony
went
along
here
yesterday
an
a
single
horse
made
that
fresh
wal
milt
for
a
hunter
you
ai
so
bad
at
hoss
tracks
observed
john
but
how
many
hosses
went
yesterday
i
could
make
out
several
maybe
four
or
six
hosses
an
a
colt
or
little
mustang
unshod
to
be
wal
supposin
they
did
what
it
mean
to
us
i
do
know
as
i
thought
anythin
unusual
if
it
had
been
for
that
smoke
we
saw
off
the
rim
an
then
this
here
fresh
track
made
along
looks
queer
to
wish
roy
was
here
replied
john
scratching
his
head
milt
i
a
hunch
if
he
was
he
foller
them
maybe
but
we
have
time
for
that
we
can
backtrail
them
though
if
they
keep
clear
as
they
are
here
an
we
not
lose
any
time
that
broad
track
led
straight
toward
pine
down
to
the
edge
of
the
cedars
where
amid
some
jagged
rocks
evidences
showed
that
men
had
camped
there
for
days
here
it
ended
as
a
broad
trail
but
from
the
north
came
the
single
fresh
track
made
that
very
day
and
from
the
east
more
in
a
line
with
pine
came
two
tracks
made
the
day
before
and
these
were
imprints
of
big
and
little
hoofs
manifestly
these
interested
john
more
than
they
did
dale
who
had
to
wait
for
his
companion
milt
it
ai
a
colt
thet
little
track
avowed
john
why
not
an
what
if
it
is
queried
dale
wal
it
ai
because
a
colt
always
straggles
back
an
from
one
side
to
this
little
track
keeps
close
to
the
big
one
an
by
george
it
was
made
by
a
led
john
resembled
roy
beeman
then
with
that
leaping
intent
fire
in
his
gray
eyes
dale
reply
was
to
spur
his
horse
into
a
trot
and
call
sharply
to
the
lagging
cougar
when
they
turned
into
the
broad
road
that
was
the
only
thoroughfare
of
pine
the
sun
was
setting
red
and
gold
behind
the
mountains
the
horses
were
too
tired
for
any
more
than
a
walk
natives
of
the
village
catching
sight
of
dale
and
beeman
and
the
huge
gray
cat
following
like
a
dog
called
excitedly
to
one
another
a
group
of
men
in
front
of
turner
gazed
intently
down
the
road
and
soon
manifested
signs
of
excitement
dale
and
his
comrade
dismounted
in
front
of
widow
cass
cottage
and
dale
called
as
he
strode
up
the
little
path
cass
came
out
she
was
white
and
shaking
but
appeared
calm
at
sight
of
her
john
beeman
drew
a
sharp
breath
wal
now
he
began
hoarsely
and
left
off
how
roy
queried
dale
lord
knows
i
glad
to
see
you
boys
milt
you
thin
roy
had
a
little
setback
he
got
a
shock
it
throwed
him
off
fever
an
now
he
out
of
his
head
it
wo
do
no
good
for
you
to
waste
time
seein
him
take
my
word
for
it
all
right
but
there
others
as
for
the
land
sakes
milt
dale
you
fetched
thet
cougar
back
do
let
him
near
me
tom
wo
hurt
you
mother
said
dale
as
the
cougar
came
padding
up
the
path
you
were
sayin
somethin
about
others
is
miss
helen
safe
hurry
ride
up
to
see
her
an
waste
no
more
time
dale
was
quick
in
the
saddle
followed
by
john
but
the
horses
had
to
be
severely
punished
to
force
them
even
to
a
trot
and
that
was
a
lagging
trot
which
now
did
not
leave
torn
behind
the
ride
up
to
auchincloss
seemed
endless
to
dale
natives
came
out
in
the
road
to
watch
after
he
had
passed
stern
as
dale
was
in
dominating
his
feelings
he
could
not
wholly
subordinate
his
mounting
joy
to
a
waiting
terrible
anticipation
of
catastrophe
but
no
matter
what
awaited
nor
what
fateful
events
might
hinge
upon
this
nameless
circumstance
about
to
be
disclosed
the
wonderful
and
glorious
fact
of
the
present
was
that
in
a
moment
he
would
see
helen
rayner
there
were
saddled
horses
in
the
courtyard
but
no
riders
a
mexican
boy
sat
on
the
porch
bench
in
the
seat
where
dale
remembered
he
had
encountered
al
auchincloss
the
door
of
the
big
was
open
the
scent
of
flowers
the
murmur
of
bees
the
pounding
of
hoofs
came
vaguely
to
dale
his
eyes
dimmed
so
that
the
ground
when
he
slid
out
of
his
saddle
seemed
far
below
him
he
stepped
upon
the
porch
his
sight
suddenly
cleared
a
tight
fullness
at
his
throat
made
incoherent
the
words
he
said
to
the
mexican
boy
but
they
were
understood
as
the
boy
ran
back
around
the
house
dale
knocked
sharply
and
stepped
over
the
threshold
outside
john
true
to
his
habits
was
thinking
even
in
that
moment
of
suspense
about
the
faithful
exhausted
horses
as
he
unsaddled
them
he
talked
fer
soft
an
fat
hosses
winterin
high
up
wal
you
done
somethin
then
dale
heard
a
voice
in
another
room
a
step
a
creak
of
the
door
it
opened
a
woman
in
white
appeared
he
recognized
helen
but
instead
of
the
rich
brown
bloom
and
beauty
so
hauntingly
limned
on
his
memory
he
saw
a
white
beautiful
face
strained
and
quivering
in
anguish
and
eyes
that
pierced
his
heart
he
could
not
speak
oh
my
friend
you
come
she
whispered
dale
put
out
a
shaking
hand
but
she
did
not
see
it
she
clutched
his
shoulders
as
if
to
feel
whether
or
not
he
was
real
and
then
her
arms
went
up
round
his
neck
oh
thank
god
i
knew
you
would
come
she
said
and
her
head
sank
to
his
shoulder
dale
divined
what
he
had
suspected
helen
sister
had
been
carried
off
yet
while
his
quick
mind
grasped
helen
broken
spirit
the
unbalance
that
was
reason
for
this
marvelous
and
glorious
act
he
did
not
take
other
meaning
of
the
embrace
to
himself
he
just
stood
there
transported
charged
like
a
tree
struck
by
lightning
making
sure
with
all
his
keen
senses
so
that
he
could
feel
forever
how
she
was
clinging
round
his
neck
her
face
over
his
bursting
heart
her
quivering
form
close
pressed
to
his
it
bo
he
said
unsteadily
she
went
riding
yesterday
and
never
came
back
replied
helen
brokenly
i
seen
her
trail
she
been
taken
into
the
woods
i
find
her
i
fetch
her
back
he
replied
rapidly
with
a
shock
she
seemed
to
absorb
his
meaning
with
another
shock
she
raised
her
face
leaned
back
a
little
to
look
at
him
you
find
her
fetch
her
back
yes
he
answered
instantly
with
that
ringing
word
it
seemed
to
dale
she
realized
how
she
was
standing
he
felt
her
shake
as
she
dropped
her
arms
and
stepped
back
while
the
white
anguish
of
her
face
was
flooded
out
by
a
wave
of
scarlet
but
she
was
brave
in
her
confusion
her
eyes
never
fell
though
they
changed
swiftly
darkening
with
shame
amaze
and
with
feelings
he
could
not
read
i
almost
out
of
my
head
she
faltered
no
wonder
i
saw
that
but
now
you
must
get
i
no
time
to
he
led
her
to
the
door
john
it
bo
that
gone
he
called
since
yesterday

the
boy
to
get

bag

the
corral
an
get
me
a
fresh
horse
my
old
horse
ranger
if
you
can
find
him
quick
without
a
word
john
leaped
bareback
on
one
of
the
horses
he
had
just
unsaddled
and
spurred
him
across
the
courtyard
then
the
big
cougar
seeing
helen
got
up
from
where
he
lay
on
the
porch
and
came
to
her
oh
it
tom
cried
helen
and
as
he
rubbed
against
her
knees
she
patted
his
head
with
trembling
hand
you

beautiful
pet
oh
how
i
remember
oh
how
bo

all
along

where

in
love
with

at
odds
neither

there
hard
ground
off

north
range
so

he
was
able
to
follow
her
tracks
only
so
were
there
any
other
tracks
along
with
hers
miss
helen
i
found
them
southeast
of
pine
up
on
the
slope
of
the
mountain
there
were
seven
other
horses
makin
that
trail
when
we
run
across
it
on
the
way
down
we
found
a
camp
where
men
had
waited
bo
pony
led
by
a
rider
on
a
big
horse
come
into
that
camp
from
the
east
maybe
north
a
little
an
that
tells
the
riggs
ran
her
down
made
off
with
her
cried
helen
passionately
oh

villain
he
had
men
in
waiting
that
beasley
work
they
were
after
it
may
not
be
just
what
you
said
but
that
close
enough
an
in
a
bad
fix
you
must
face
that
an
try
to
bear
up
under
fears
of
the
my
friend
you
will
save
her
i
fetch
her
back
alive
or
dead
oh
my
god
helen
cried
and
closed
her
eyes
an
instant
to
open
them
burning
black
but
bo
is
dead
i
know
that
i
feel
it
not
die
very
easy
she
a
little
savage
she
has
no
fear
she
fight
like
a
tigress
for
her
life
she
strong
you
remember
how
strong
she
can
stand
anything
unless
they
murder
her
outright
she
live
a
long
time
through
any
ordeal
so
i
beg
you
my
friend
do
lose
an
hour
do
ever
give
up
dale
trembled
under
the
clasp
of
her
hands
loosing
his
own
from
her
clinging
hold
he
stepped
out
on
the
porch
at
that
moment
john
appeared
on
ranger
coming
at
a
gallop
nell
i
never
come
back
without
her
said
dale
i
reckon
you
can
hope
only
be
prepared
that
all
it
hard
but
these
damned
deals
are
common
out
here
in
the
suppose
beasley
comes
here
exclaimed
helen
and
again
her
hand
went
out
toward
him
if
he
does
you
refuse
to
get
off
replied
dale
but
do
let
him
or
his
greasers
put
a
dirty
hand
on
you
should
he
threaten
force
why
pack
some
clothes
an
your
valuables
an
go
down
to
cass
wait
till
i
come
back
wait
till
you
come
back
she
faltered
slowly
turning
white
again
her
dark
eyes
dilated
milt
you
like
las
vegas
you
kill
beasley
dale
heard
his
own
laugh
very
cold
and
strange
foreign
to
his
ears
a
grim
deadly
hate
of
beasley
vied
with
the
tenderness
and
pity
he
felt
for
this
distressed
girl
it
was
a
sore
trial
to
see
her
leaning
there
against
the
door
to
be
compelled
to
leave
her
alone
abruptly
be
stalked
off
the
porch
tom
followed
him
the
black
horse
whinnied
his
recognition
of
dale
and
snorted
at
sight
of
the
cougar
just
then
the
mexican
boy
returned
with
a
bag
dale
tied
this
with
the
small
pack
behind
the
saddle
john
you
stay
here
with
miss
helen
said
dale
an
if
carmichael
comes
back
keep
him
too
an
if
any
one
rides
into
pine
from
the
way
we
come
you
be
sure
to
spot
i
do
thet
milt
responded
john
dale
mounted
and
turning
for
a
last
word
to
helen
he
felt
the
words
of
cheer
halted
on
his
lips
as
he
saw
her
standing
white
and
with
her
hands
to
her
bosom
he
could
not
look
twice
come
on
there
you
tom
he
called
to
the
cougar
reckon
on
this
track
you
pay
me
for
all
my
trainin
of
oh
my
friend
came
helen
sad
voice
almost
a
whisper
to
his
throbbing
ears
heaven
help
you
to
save
her
i
then
ranger
started
and
dale
heard
no
more
he
could
not
look
back
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
and
his
breast
ached
by
a
tremendous
effort
he
shifted
that
emotion
called
on
all
the
spiritual
energy
of
his
being
to
the
duty
of
this
grim
task
before
him
he
did
not
ride
down
through
the
village
but
skirted
the
northern
border
and
worked
round
to
the
south
where
coming
to
the
trail
he
had
made
an
hour
past
he
headed
on
it
straight
for
the
slope
now
darkening
in
the
twilight
the
big
cougar
showed
more
willingness
to
return
on
this
trail
than
he
had
shown
in
the
coming
ranger
was
fresh
and
wanted
to
go
but
dale
held
him
in
a
cool
wind
blew
down
from
the
mountain
with
the
coming
of
night
against
the
brightening
stars
dale
saw
the
promontory
lift
its
bold
outline
it
was
miles
away
it
haunted
him
strangely
calling
a
night
and
perhaps
a
day
separated
him
from
the
gang
that
held
bo
rayner
prisoner
dale
had
no
plan
as
yet
he
had
only
a
motive
as
great
as
the
love
he
bore
helen
rayner
beasley
evil
genius
had
planned
this
abduction
riggs
was
a
tool
a
cowardly
knave
dominated
by
a
stronger
will
snake
anson
and
his
gang
had
lain
in
wait
at
that
cedar
camp
had
made
that
broad
hoof
track
leading
up
the
mountain
beasley
had
been
there
with
them
that
very
day
all
this
was
as
assured
to
dale
as
if
he
had
seen
the
men
but
the
matter
of
dale
recovering
the
girl
and
doing
it
speedily
strung
his
mental
strength
to
its
highest
pitch
many
outlines
of
action
flashed
through
his
mind
as
he
rode
on
peering
keenly
through
the
night
listening
with
practised
ears
all
were
rejected
and
at
the
outset
of
every
new
branching
of
thought
he
would
gaze
down
at
the
gray
form
of
the
cougar
long
graceful
heavy
as
he
padded
beside
the
horse
from
the
first
thought
of
returning
to
help
helen
rayner
he
had
conceived
an
undefined
idea
of
possible
value
in
the
qualities
of
his
pet
tom
had
performed
wonderful
feats
of
trailing
but
he
had
never
been
tried
on
men
dale
believed
he
could
make
him
trail
anything
yet
he
had
no
proof
of
this
one
fact
stood
out
of
all
dale
conjectures
and
it
was
that
he
had
known
men
and
brave
men
to
fear
cougars
far
up
on
the
slope
in
a
little
hollow
where
water
ran
and
there
was
a
little
grass
for
ranger
to
pick
dale
haltered
him
and
made
ready
to
spend
the
night
he
was
sparing
with
his
food
giving
tom
more
than
he
took
himself
curled
close
up
to
dale
the
big
cat
went
to
sleep
but
dale
lay
awake
for
long
the
night
was
still
with
only
a
faint
moan
of
wind
on
this
sheltered
slope
dale
saw
hope
in
the
stars
he
did

himself

helen
that
he
could
save
her
sister
and
then
her
property
he
seemed
to
have
stated
something
unconsciously
settled
outside
of
his
thinking
strange
how
this
certainty
was
not
vague
yet
irreconcilable
with
any
plans
he
created
behind
it
somehow
nameless
with
inconceivable
power
surged
all
his
wonderful
knowledge
of
forest
of
trails
of
scents
of
night
of
the
nature
of
men
lying
down
to
sleep
in
the
dark
lonely
woods
of
the
nature
of
this
great
cat
that
lived
its
every
action
in
accordance
with
his
will
he
grew
sleepy
and
gradually
his
mind
stilled
with
his
last
conscious
thought
a
portent
that
he
would
awaken
to
accomplish
his
desperate
task

the

on

in

of

but
manifestly
anson
did
not

to
remain
there
long
for
after
breakfast
the
packs
had
been
made
up
and
the
horses
stood
saddled
and
bridled
they
were
restless
and
uneasy
tossing

and
fighting

a

smoldering
fire
in

light

a
sullen
set
to
his
jaw
every
little
while
he
would
raise
his
eyes
to
glance
at
riggs
and
it
seemed
that
a
quick
glance
was
enough
riggs
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
open
coatless
and
hatless
his

and

dusty
and
torn
an
enormous
gun
bumped
awkwardly
in

swinging
below
his

looked
perturbed
his
face
was
sweating
freely
yet
it
was
far
from

in

he
did
not
appear
to
mind
the
sun
or
the
flies
his
eyes
were
staring
dark
wild
shifting
in
gaze
from
everything
they
encountered
but
often
that
gaze
shot
back
to
the
captive
girl
sitting
under
a
cedar
some
yards
from
the
man
bo
rayner
little
booted
feet
were
tied
together
with
one
end
of
a
lasso
and
the
other
end
trailed
off
over
the
ground
her
hands
were
free
her
was
dusty
and
disordered
her
eyes
blazed
defiantly
out
of
a
small
pale
face
harve
riggs
i
would
be
standing
in
those
cheap
boots
of
yours
for
a
million
dollars
she
said
sarcastically
riggs
took
no
notice
of
her
words
you
pack
that
wrong
end
out
what
have
you
got
the
gun
for
anyhow
she
added
tauntingly
snake
anson
let
out
a
hoarse
laugh
and
moze
black
visage
opened
in
a
huge
grin
jim
wilson
seemed
to
drink
in
the
girl
words
sullen
and
somber
he
bent
his
lean
head
very
still
as
if
listening
you
better
shut
up
said
riggs
darkly
i
will
not
shut
up
declared

exclaimed
hotly

it
i
tear
that
long
hair
of
yours
right
off
your
riggs
advanced
toward
her
with
his
hands
clutching
as
if
eager
to
throttle
her
the
girl
leaned
forward
her
face
reddening
her
eyes
fierce
you
damned
little
cat
muttered
riggs
thickly
i

the
feet
of
any
of
these
riggs
took
two
long
strides
and
bent
over
her
his
teeth
protruding
in
a
snarl
and
he
cuffed
her
hard
on
the
side
of
the
head
bo
head
jerked
back
with
the
force
of
the
blow
but
she
uttered
no
cry
are
you
goin
to
keep
your
jaw
shut
he
demanded
stridently
and
a
dark
tide
of
blood
surged
up
into
his
neck
i
should
smile

not
retorted

cool
deliberate
anger

had
stopped

and
was
watching
listening
with
expression
on
his
face
jim
wilson
slowly
rose
to
his
feet
if
any
one
had
observed
him
it
would
have
been
to
note
that
he
now
seemed
singularly
fascinated
by
this
scene
yet
all
the
while
absorbed
in
himself
once
he
loosened
the
of
his
blouse
riggs
swung
his
arm
more
violently
at
the
girl
but
she
dodged
you
dog
she
hissed
oh
if
i
only
had
a
gun
her
face
then
with
its
dead
whiteness
and
the
eyes
of
flame
held
a
tragic
impelling
beauty
that
stung

into
remonstrance

camp
riggs
shook
his
head
he
was
paler
now
and
sweating
more
freely
the
dank
hair
hung
wet
over
his
forehead
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
suddenly
realizing
he
had
gotten
into
a
tight
place
oh
he
a
liar
exclaimed
bo
with
contemptuous
ring
in
her
voice
he

from
my
country
he
has
known
nell
and
me
for
snake
anson
turned
to
look
at
wilson
jim
now
hyar
a
queer
deal
this
feller
has
rung
in
on
us
i
thought
thet
kid
was
pretty
young
do

remember
beasley

a
handsome
woman
wal
pard
anson

drawled

so
your
texas
chilvaree
over

some
operatin
retorted
anson
with
fine
sarcasm
but
thet
ai
tellin
me
what
you
think
wal
i
ai
tellin
you
what
i
think
yet
but
i
know
thet
kid
nell
rayner
for
i
seen
anson
studied
his
man
for
a
moment
then
taking
out
his
he
sat
himself
down
upon
a
stone
and
proceeded
leisurely
to
roll
a
cigarette
he
put
it
between
his
thin
lips
and
apparently
forgot
to
light
it
for
a
few
moments
he
gazed
at
the
yellow
ground
and
some
scant
riggs
took
to
pacing
up
and
down
wilson
leaned
as
before
against
the
cedar
the
girl
slowly
recovered
from
her
excess
of
anger
kid
see
hyar
said
anson
addressing
the
girl
if
riggs
knowed
you
was
nell
an
fetched
you
along
anyhow
what
he
do
thet
fur
he
chased
me
caught
me
then
he
saw
some
one
after
us
and
he
hurried
to
your
camp
he
was
afraid
the
cur
riggs
heard
her
reply
for
he
turned
a
malignant
glance
upon
her
anson
i
fetched
her
because
i
know
nell
rayner
will
give
up
on
earth
for
her
he
said
in
loud
voice
anson
pondered
this
statement
with
an
air
of
considering
its
apparent
sincerity
do
you
believe
him
declared
bo
rayner
bluntly
he
a
liar
beasley
and
all
of
riggs
raised
a
shaking
hand
to
clench
it
at
her
keep
still
or
it
be
the
worse
for
riggs
shut
up
yourself
put
in
anson
as
he
leisurely
rose
mebbe
it
occurred
to
you
thet
she
might
have
some
talk
interestin
to
me
an
i
runnin
this
hyar
camp
now
kid
talk
up
an
say
what
you
i
said
he
was
you
all
replied
the
girl
instantly
why
i
surprised
you
be
caught
in
his
company
my
uncle
al
and
my
sweetheart
carmichael
and
my
friend
dale
they
all
told
me
what
western
men
are
even
down
to
outlaws
robbers
cutthroat
rascals
like
you
and
i
know
the
west
well
enough
now
to
be
sure
that
does
belong
here
and
ca
last
here
he
went
to
dodge
city
once
and
when
he
came
back
he
made
a
bluff
at
being
a
bad
man
he
was
a
swaggering
bragging
drinking
he
talked
of
the
men
shot
of
the
fights
he
had
he
dressed
like
some
of
those
gamblers
he
was
in
love
with
my
sister
nell
she
hated
him
he
followed
us
out
west
and
he
has
hung
on
our
actions
like
a
sneaking
indian
why
nell
and
i
could
even
walk
to
the
store
in
the
village
he
rode
after
me
out
on
the
range
chased
me
for
that
carmichael
called
riggs
bluff
down
in
turner
saloon
dared
him
to
draw
cussed
him
every
name
on
the
range
slapped
and
beat
and
kicked
him
drove
him
out
of
pine
and
now
whatever
he
has
said
to
beasley
or
you
it
a
dead
sure
bet
he
playing
his
own
game
that
to
get
hold
of
nell
and
if
not
her
then
me
oh
i
out
of
breath
and
i
out
of
names
to
call
him
if
i
talked
forever
i
never
be
able
to
do
him
justice
but
lend
me
a
gun
a
minute
jim
wilson
quiet
form
vibrated
with
a
start
anson
with
his
admiring
smile
pulled
his
gun
and
taking
a
couple
of
steps
forward
held
it
out
butt
first
she
stretched
eagerly
for
it
and
he
jerked
it
away
hold
on
there
yelled
riggs
in
alarm
damme
jim
if
she
did
mean
bizness
exclaimed
the
outlaw
wal
now
see
heah
miss
would
you
bore
him
if
you
hed
a
gun
inquired
wilson
with
curious
interest
there
was
more
of
respect
in
his
demeanor
than
admiration
no
i
do
want
his
cowardly
blood
on
my
hands
replied
the
girl
but
i
make
him
dance
i
make
him
shore
you
can
handle
a
gun
she
nodded
her
answer
while
her
eyes
flashed
hate
and
her
resolute
lips
twitched
then
wilson
made
a
singularly
swift
motion
and
his
gun
was
pitched
butt
first
to
within
a
foot
of
her
hand
she
snatched
it
up
cocked
it
aimed
it
all
before
anson
could
move
but
he
yelled
drop
thet
gun
you
little
devil
riggs
turned
ghastly
as
the
big
blue
gun
lined
on
him
he
also
yelled
but
that
yell
was
different
from
anson
run
or
dance
cried
the
girl
the
big
gun
boomed
and
leaped
almost
out
of
her
hand
she
took
both
hands
and
called
derisively
as
she
fired
again
the
second
bullet
hit
at
riggs
feet
scattering
the
dust
and
fragments
of
stone
all
over
him
he
bounded
here
there
then
darted
for
the
rocks
a
third
time
the
heavy
gun
spoke
and
this
bullet
must
have
ticked
riggs
for
he
let
out
a
hoarse
bawl
and
leaped
sheer
for
the
protection
of
a
rock
plug
him
shoot
off
a
leg
yelled
snake
anson
whooping
and
stamping
as
riggs
got
out
of
sight
jim
wilson
watched
the
whole
performance
with
the
same
quietness
that
had
characterized
his
manner
toward
the
girl
then
as
riggs
disappeared
wilson
stepped
forward
and
took
the
gun
from
the
trembling
hands
she
was
whiter
than
ever
but
still
resolute
and
defiant
wilson
took
a
glance
over
in
the
direction
riggs
had
hidden
and
then
proceeded
to
reload
the
gun
snake
anson
roar
of
laughter
ceased
rather
suddenly
hyar
jim
she
might
have
held
up
the
whole
gang
with
thet
gun
he
protested
i
reckon
she
nothin
us
replied
wilson
you
know
a
lot
about
wimmen
now
do
you
but
thet
did
my
heart
good
jim
what
earth
would
you
have
did
if
thet
been
you
instead
of
riggs
the
query
seemed
important
and
amazing
wilson
pondered
shore
i
stood
there
an
never
moved
an
an
let
her
shoot
ejaculated
anson
nodding
his
long
head
me
too
so
these
rough
outlaws
inured
to
all
the
violence
and
baseness
of
their
dishonest
calling
rose
to
the
challenging
courage
of
a
slip
of
a
girl
she
had
the
one
thing
they
respected
nerve
just
then
a
halloo
from
the
promontory
brought
anson
up
with
a
start
muttering
to
himself
he
strode
out
toward
the
jagged
rocks
that
hid
the
outlook
moze
shuffled
his
burly
form
after
anson
miss
it
shore
was
grand
thet
performance
of
mister

jim

mebbe

difference
in

understood
him
and
paid
him
the
compliment
not
to
voice
her
sudden
upflashing
hope
that
he
might
be
one
to

went
on
rolling
down
his
trousers

lapped
a
fold
over
at
the
bottom
and
pulled
on
his
boot
then
he
strode
out
toward
the
promontory
there
he
encountered
anson
tramping
back
beasley

point
of

by

said
the
outlaw
leader
riggs
went
on
to
the
promontory
to
look
for
himself
where
the
girl
demanded
anson
in
surprise
when
he

a
surprised
stare
and
suddenly
lost
the
bantering
tone
so
thet
how
it
workin
he
replied
and
flung
himself
down
in
the
shade
young
burt
made
his
appearance
then
wiping
his
sallow
face
his
hungry
eyes
upon
which
his
comrades
set
such
store
roved
around
the
camp
whar
the
gurl
he
queried
jim

go
out
fer
a
stroll
replied
anson
i
seen
jim

gittin
softy
over

haw

haw
but
snake
anson
did
not
crack
a
smile
the
atmosphere
appeared
not
to
be
congenial
for
jokes
a
fact
burt
rather
suddenly
divined
riggs
and
moze
returned
from
the
promontory
the
latter
reporting
that
shady
jones
was
riding
up
close
then
the
girl
walked
slowly
into
sight
and
approached
to
find
a
seat
within
ten
yards
of
the
group
they
waited
in
silence
until
the
expected
horseman
rode
up
with
slung
on
both
sides
of
his
saddle
his
advent
was
welcome
all
the
men
were
thirsty
wilson
took
water
to
the
girl
before
drinking
himself
thet
an
hot
ride
fer
water
declared
the
outlaw
shady
who
somehow
fitted
his
name
in
color
and
impression
an
boss
if

the
same
to
you
i
wo
take
it
cheer
up

rustlin
back
in
the

cheerfulest
news

hed
in
some
days
hey
moze
the
moze
nodded
his
shaggy
head
i
sick
an
sore
of
this
deal
broke
out
burt
evidently
encouraged
by
his
elders
ever
since
last
fall
we
been
hangin
till
jest
lately
freezin
in
camps
no
money
no
drink
no
grub
wuth
havin
all
on
promises
not
improbably
this
young
and
reckless
member
of
the
gang
had
struck
the
note
of
discord
wilson
seemed
most
detached
from
any
sentiment
prevailing
there
some
strong
thoughts
were
revolving
in
his
brain
burt
you
ai
insinuatin
thet
i
made
promises
inquired
anson
ominously
no
boss
i
ai
you
allus
said
we
might
hit
it
rich
but
them
promises
was
made
to
you
an
it
be
jest
like
thet
greaser
to
go
back
on
his
word
now
we
got
the
son
it
happens
we
got
the
wrong
one
our
pard
hyar
mister
riggs
him
with
the
big
gun
he
waltzes
up
with
this
sassy
kid
instead
of
the
woman
beasley
burt
snorted
his
disgust
while
shady
jones
roundly
swearing
pelted
the
smoldering
with
stones
then
they
all
lapsed
into
surly
silence
the
object
of
their
growing
scorn
riggs
sat
a
little
way
apart
facing
none
of
them
but
maintaining
as
bold
a
front
as
apparently
he
could
muster
presently
a
horse
shot
up
his
ears
the
first
indication
of
scent
or
sound
imperceptible
to
the
men
but
with
this
cue
they
all
except
wilson
sat
up
attentively
soon
the
crack
of
hoofs
on
stone
broke
the
silence
riggs
nervously
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
others
still
excepting
wilson
one
by
one
followed
suit
in
another
moment
a
rangy
bay
horse
trotted
out
of
the
cedars
up
to
the
camp
and
his
rider
jumped
off
nimbly
for
so
heavy
a
man
howdy
beasley
was
anson
greeting
hello
snake
old
man
replied
beasley
as
his
bold
snapping
black
eyes
swept
the
group
he
was
dusty
and
hot
and
wet
with
sweat
yet
evidently
too
excited
to
feel
discomfort
i
seen
your
smoke
signal
first
off
an
jumped
my
hoss
quick
but
i
rode
north
of
pine
before
i
headed
this
way
did
you
corral
the
girl
or
did
riggs
say
you
look
queer
what

you
have
signaled
me
for
nothin
snake
anson
beckoned
to
bo
come
out
of
the
shade
let
him
look

the
girl
walked
out
from
under
the
spreading
cedar
that
had
hidden
her
from
sight
beasley
stared
aghast
his
jaw
dropped
thet
the
kid
sister
of
the
woman
i
wanted
he
ejaculated
so
we
jest
been
astonishment

held

echoed
suddenly
his
big
body
leaped
with
a
start
who

who
fetched
her
why
mister
gunman
riggs
hyar
replied
anson
with
a
subtle
scorn
riggs

beasley
you

thet
mistake
once
before
what

riggs
an
i

a
word

beasley
you

or
locoed
or
what
beasley
he
was
giving
you
the
cut
in
bo
rayner
cool
voice
the
rancher
stared
speechlessly
at
her
then
at
anson
then
at
wilson
and
last
at
riggs
when
his
brown
visage
shaded
dark
with
rush
of
purple
blood
with
one
lunge
he
knocked
riggs
flat
then
stood
over
him
with
a
convulsive
hand
at
his
gun
you
i
a
notion
to
bore
you
they
told
me
you
had
a
deal
of
your
own
an
now
i
believe
yes
i
had
replied
riggs
cautiously
getting
up
he
was
ghastly
but
i
was
you
your
deal
was
to
get
the
girl
away
from
home
so
you
could
take
possession
of
her
property
an
i
wanted
what
for
did
you
fetch
the
sister
then
demanded
beasley
his
big
jaw
bulging
because
i
a
plan
to
plan
hell
you
spoiled
my
plan
an
i
seen
about
enough
of
beasley
breathed
hard
his
lowering
gaze
boded
an
uncertain
will
toward
the
man
who
had
crossed
him
his
hand
still
hung
low
and
clutching
beasley
tell
them
to
get
my
horse
i
want
to
go
home
said
bo
rayner
slowly
beasley
turned
her
words
enjoined
a
silence
what
to
do
with
her
now
appeared
a
problem
i
had
nothin
to
do
with
fetchin
you
here
an
i
have
nothin
to
do
with
sendin
you
back
or
whatever
done
with
you
declared
beasley
then
the
girl
face
flashed
white
again
and
her
eyes
changed
to
fire
you
as
big
a
liar
as
riggs
she
cried
passionately
and
a
thief
a
bully
who
picks
on
defenseless
girls
oh
we
know
your
game
milt
dale
heard
your
plot
with
this
outlaw
anson
to

my
sister
you

to
be
hanged
you
greaser
i
cut
out
your
tongue
hissed
beasley
yes

bet
you
would
if
you
had
me
alone
but
these
outlaws
these
these
tools

hire
are
better
than

and
riggs
what

do
to
you
carmichael
he
my
sweetheart
that
cowboy
you

what
he
did
to
riggs
have
you
brains
enough
to
know
what
he
do
to
you
he
not
do
much
growled
beasley
but
the
thick
purplish
blood
was
receding
from
his
face
your
cowpuncher
bah
she
interrupted
and
she
snapped
her
fingers
in
his
face
from
texas
he
from
texas
supposin

texas
demanded
beasley
in
angry
irritation
what
thet
texans
are
all
over
there
jim
wilson
snake
man
he
from
texas
but
thet
ai
scarin
any
he
pointed
toward
wilson
who
shifted
uneasily
from
foot
to
foot
the
girl
flaming
glance
followed
his
hand
are
you
from
texas
she
asked
yes
miss
i
am
an
i
reckon
i
do
deserve
it
replied
wilson
it
was
certain
that
a
vague
shame
attended
his
confession
oh
i
believed
even
a
bandit
from
texas
would
fight
for
a
helpless
girl
she
replied
in
withering
scorn
of
disappointment
jim
wilson
dropped
his
head
if
any
one
there
suspected
a
serious
turn
to
wilson
attitude
toward
that
situation
it
was
the
keen
outlaw
leader
beasley
you
courtin
death
he
broke
in
you
bet
you
are
added
bo
with
a
passion
that
made
her
listeners
quiver
you
put
me
at
the
mercy
of
a
gang
of
outlaws
you
may
force
my
sister
out
of
her
home
but
your
day
will
come
tom
carmichael
will
kill
beasley
mounted
his
horse
sullen
livid
furious
he
sat
shaking
in
the
saddle
to
glare
down
at
the
outlaw
leader
snake
thet
no
fault
of
mine
the
deal
miscarried
i
was
square
i
made
my
offer
for

anson
slowly
but
if

tried
hard
my
men
are
all
sore
an

an
you

i
reckon

demanded
beasley
no

responded
anson
sharply
then
thet

of
the
whole

make
riggs
pay
up
he
got
money
an
he
got
plans
go
in
with
with
that
beasley
spurred
his
horse
wheeled
and
rode
away
the
outlaws
gazed
after
him
until
he
disappeared
in
the
cedars
what
you
expect
from
a
greaser
queried
shady
jones
anson
did
i
say
so
added
burt
the
moze
rolled
his
eyes
like
a
mad
bull
and
jim
wilson
studiously
examined
a
stick
he
held
in
his
hands
riggs
showed
immense
relief
anson
stake
me
to
some
of
your
outfit
an
i
ride
off
with
the
girl
he
said
eagerly
where
you
go
now
queried
anson
curiously
riggs
appeared
at
a
loss
for
a
quick
answer
his
wits
were
no
more
equal
to
this
predicament
than
his
nerve
you
no
woodsman
an
onless
you
plumb
locoed
you
never
risk
goin
near
pine
or
show
down
there
be
real
trackers
huntin
your
the
listening
girl
suddenly
appealed
to
wilson
do
let
him
take
me
off
alone
in
the
woods
she
faltered
that
was
the
first
indication
of
her
weakening
jim
wilson
broke
into
gruff
reply
i
not
bossin
this
but

a
man
she
importuned
riggs

craftily
i
particular
curious

brand
snake
lem

the
girl
back
to

said
jim
wilson
anson
swore
his
amaze
it
sense
continued
wilson
we

troubles

her
only

concluded
wilson
jim
if
we
wanted
to
git
rid
of
her
we
let
riggs
take
her
off
remonstrated
the
outlaw
leader
he
was
perturbed
and
undecided
wilson
worried
him
the
long
texan
veered
around
full
faced
what
subtle
transformation
in
him
like
hell
we
would
he
said
it
could
not
have
been
the
tone
that
caused
anson
to
quail
he
might
have
been
leader
here
but
he
was
not
the
greater
man
his
face
clouded
break
camp
he
ordered
riggs
had
probably
not
heard
that
last
exchange
between
anson
and
wilson
for
he
had
walked
a
few
rods
aside
to
get
his
horse
in
a
few
moments
when
they
started
off
burt
jones
and
moze
were
in
the
lead
driving
the
anson
rode
next
the
girl
came
between
him
and
riggs
and
significantly
it
seemed
jim
wilson
brought
up
the
rear
this
start
was
made
a
little
after
the
noon
hour
they
zigzagged
up
the
slope
took
to
a
deep
ravine
and
followed
it
up
to
where
it
headed
in
the
level
forest
from
there
travel
was
rapid
the
being
driven
at
a
jogtrot
once
when
a
troop
of
deer
burst
out
of
a
thicket
into
a
glade
to
stand
with
ears
high
young
burt
halted
the
cavalcade
his
shot
brought
down
a
deer
then
the
men
rode
on
leaving
him
behind
to
dress
and
pack
the
meat
the
only
other
halt
made
was
at
the
crossing
of
the
first
water
a
clear
swift
brook
where
both
horses
and
men
drank
thirstily
here
burt
caught
up
with
his
comrades
they
traversed
glade
and
park
and
wended
a
crooked
trail
through
the
deepening
forest
and
climbed
bench
after
bench
to
higher
ground
while
the
sun
sloped
to
the
westward
lower
and
redder
sunset
had
gone
and
twilight
was
momentarily
brightening
to
the
afterglow
when
anson
breaking
his
silence
of
the
afternoon
ordered
a
halt
the
place
was
wild
dismal
a
shallow
vale
between
dark
slopes
of
spruce
grass
and
water
were
there
in
abundance
all
the
men
were
off
throwing
saddles
and
packs
before
the
tired
girl
made
an
effort
to
get
down
riggs
observing
her
made
a
not
ungentle
move
to
pull
her
off
she
gave
him
a
sounding
slap
with
her
gloved
hand
keep
your
paws
to
yourself
she
said
no
evidence
of
exhaustion
was
there
in
her
spirit
wilson
had
observed
this
but
anson
had
not
what
come
off
he
asked
wal
the
honorable
gunman
riggs
jest
got
caressed
by
the
lady
as
he
was
doin
the
elegant
replied
moze
who
stood
nearest
jim
was
you
watchin
queried
anson
his
curiosity
had
held
through
the
afternoon
he
tried
to
yank
her
off
an
she
biffed
him
replied
wilson
that
riggs
is
jest
daffy
or
plain
locoed
said
snake
in
an
aside
to
moze
boss
you
mean
plain
cussed
mark
my
words
he
hoodoo
this
outfit
jim
was
figgerin
hoodoo
cursed
anson
under
his
breath
many
hands
made
quick
work
in
a
few
moments
a
fire
was
burning
brightly
water
was
boiling
pots
were
steaming
the
odor
of
venison
permeated
the
cool
air
the
girl
had
at
last
slipped
off
her
saddle
to
the
ground
where
she
sat
while
riggs
led
the
horse
away
she
sat
there
apparently
forgotten
a
pathetic
droop
to
her
head
wilson
had
taken
an
ax
and
was
vigorously
wielding
it
among
the
spruces
one
by
one
they
fell
with
swish
and
soft
crash
then
the
sliding
ring
of
the
ax
told
how
he
was
slicing
off
the
branches
with
long
sweeps
presently
he
appeared
in
the
dragging
spruces
behind
him
he
made
several
trips
the
last
of
which
was
to
stagger
under
a
huge
burden
of
spruce
boughs
these
he
spread
under
a
low
projecting
branch
of
an
aspen
then
he
leaned
the
bushy
spruces
slantingly
against
this
branch
on
both
sides
quickly
improvising
a
shelter
with
narrow
aperture
in
front
next
from
one
of
the
packs
he
took
a
blanket
and
threw
that
inside
the
shelter
then
touching
the
girl
on
the
shoulder
he
whispered
when
you
ready
slip
in
there
an
do
lose
no
sleep
by
worryin
fer
i
be
layin
right
he
made
a
motion
to
indicate
his
length
across
the
front
of
the
narrow
aperture
oh
thank
you
maybe
you
really
are
a
texan
she
whispered
back
mebbe
was
his
gloomy
reply
chapter
xxi
the
girl
refused
to
take
food
proffered
her
by
riggs
but
she
ate
and
drank
a
little
that
wilson
brought
her
then
she
disappeared
in
the
spruce
whatever
loquacity
and
companionship
had
previously
existed
in
snake
anson
gang
were
not
manifest
in
this
camp
each
man
seemed
preoccupied
as
if
pondering
the
dawn
in
his
mind
of
an
ill
omen
not
clear
to
him
yet
and
not
yet
dreamed
of
by
his
fellows
they
all
smoked
then
moze
and
shady
played
cards
awhile
by
the
light
of
the
fire
but
it
was
a
dull
game
in
which
either
seldom
spoke
riggs
sought
his
blanket
first
and
the
fact
was
significant
that
he
lay
down
some
distance
from
the
spruce
shelter
which
contained
bo
rayner
presently
young
burt
went
off
grumbling
to
his
bed
and
not
long
afterward
the
did
likewise
snake
anson
and
jim
wilson
were
left
brooding
in
silence
beside
the
dying
the
night
was
dark
with
only
a
few
stars
showing
a
fitful
wind
moaned
unearthly
through
the
spruce
an
occasional
thump
of
hoof
sounded
from
the
dark
woods
no
cry
of
wolf
or
coyote
or
cat
gave
reality
to
the
wildness
of
by
and
by
those
men
who
had
rolled
in
their
blankets
were
breathing
deep
and
slow
in
heavy
slumber

or

a
law
i
recognize
in
relation

as
for

the
roughest
woods
an
wait

chance
to
work

but
snake
you
ai
takin
no
count
of
the
feelin
of
the
men
an
of
mine
an
yours
i
bet
you
my
hoss
thet
in
a
day
or
so
this
gang
will
go
to
i
feared
you
spoke
what
been
crowdin
to
git
in
my
mind
replied
anson
then
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
a
strange
gesture
of
resignation
the
outlaw
was
brave
but
all
men
of
the
wilds
recognized
a
force
stronger
than
themselves
he
sat
there
resembling
a
brooding
snake
with
basilisk
eyes
upon
the
fire
at
length
he
arose
and
without
another
word
to
his
comrade
he
walked
wearily
to
where
lay
the
dark
quiet
forms
of
the
sleepers
jim
wilson
remained
beside
the
flickering
fire
he
was
reading
something
in
the
red
embers
perhaps
the
past
shadows
were
on
his
face
not
all
from
the
fading
flames
or
the
towering
spruces
ever
and
anon
he
raised
his
head
to
listen
not
apparently
that
he
expected
any
unusual
sound
but
as
if
involuntarily
indeed
as
anson
had
said
there
was
something
nameless
in
the
air
the
black
forest
breathed
heavily
in
fitful
moans
of
wind
it
had
its
secrets
the
glances
wilson
threw
on
all
sides
betrayed
that
any
hunted
man
did
not
love
the
dark
night
though
it
hid
him
wilson
seemed
fascinated
by
the
life
inclosed
there
by
the
black
circle
of
spruce
he
might
have
been
reflecting
on
the
strange
reaction
happening
to
every
man
in
that
group
since
a
girl
had
been
brought
among
them
nothing
was
clear
however
the
forest
kept
its
secret
as
did
the
melancholy
wind
the
outlaws
were
sleeping
like
tired
beasts
with
their
dark
secrets
locked
in
their
hearts
after
a
while
wilson
put
some
sticks
on
the
red
embers
then
pulled
the
end
of
a
log
over
them
a
blaze
sputtered
up
changing
the
dark
circle
and
showing
the
sleepers
with
their
set
shadowed
faces
upturned
wilson
gazed
on
all
of
them
a
sardonic
smile
on
his
lips
and
then
his
look
fixed
upon
the
sleeper
apart
from
the
others
riggs
it
might
have
been
the
false
light
of
flame
and
shadow
that
created
wilson
expression
of
dark
and
terrible
hate
or
it
might
have
been
the
truth
expressed
in
that
lonely
unguarded
hour
from
the
depths
of
a
man
born
in
the
south
a
man
who
by
his
inheritance
of
race
had
reverence
for
all
womanhood
by
whose
strange
wild
outlawed
bloody
life
of
a
he
must
hate
with
the
deadliest
hate
this
type
that
aped
and
mocked
his
fame
it
was
a
long
gaze
wilson
rested
upon
riggs
as
strange
and
secretive
as
the
forest
wind
moaning
down
the
great
aisles
and
when
that
dark
gaze
was
withdrawn
wilson
stalked
away
to
make
his
bed
with
the
stride
of
one
ill
whom
spirit
had
liberated
force
he
laid
his
saddle
in
front
of
the
spruce
shelter
where
the
girl
had
entered
and
his
tarpaulin
and
blankets
likewise
and
then
wearily
stretched
his
long
length
to
rest
the
blazed
up
showing
the
exquisite
green
and
festooning
of
the
spruce
branches
symmetrical
and
perfect
yet
so
irregular
and
then
it
burned
out
and
died
down
leaving
all
in
the
dim
gray
starlight
the
horses
were
not
moving
around
the
moan
of
night
wind
had
grown
fainter
the
low
hum
of
insects
was
dying
away
even
the
tinkle
of
the
brook
had
diminished
and
that
growth
toward
absolute
silence
continued
yet
absolute
silence
was
never
attained
life
abided
in
the
forest
only
it
had
changed
its
form
for
the
dark
hours
anson
gang
did
not
bestir
themselves
at
the
usual
early
sunrise
hour
common
to
all
woodsmen
hunters
or
outlaws
to
whom
the
break
of
day
was
welcome
these
companions
anson
and
riggs
included
might
have
hated
to
see
the
dawn
come
it
meant
only
another
meager
meal
then
the
weary
packing
and
the
long
long
ride
to
nowhere
in
particular
and
another
meager
meal
all
toiled
for
without
even
the
necessities
of
satisfactory
living
and
assuredly
without
the
thrilling
hopes
that
made
their
life
significant
and
certainly
with
a
growing
sense
of
approaching
calamity
the
outlaw
leader
rose
surly
and
he
had
to
boot
burt
to
drive
him
out
for
the
horses
riggs
followed
him
shady
jones
did
nothing
except
grumble
wilson
by
common
consent
always
made
the
bread
and
he
was
slow
about
it
this
morning
anson
and
moze
did
the
rest
of
the
work
without
alacrity
the
girl
did
not
appear
is
she
dead
growled
anson
no
she
ai
replied
wilson
looking
up
she
sleepin
let
her
sleep
she
shore
be
a
sight
better
off
if
she
was
so
would
all
of
this
hyar
outfit
was
anson
response
wal
i
shore
reckon
we
all
be
thet
there
soon
drawled
wilson
in
his
familiar
cool
and
irritating
tone
that
said
so
much
more
than
the
content
of
the
words
anson
did
not
address
the
texas
member
of
his
party
again
burt
rode
bareback
into
camp
driving
half
the
number
of
the
horses
riggs
followed
shortly
with
several
more
but
three
were
missed
one
of
them
being
anson
favorite
he
would
not
have
budged
without
that
horse
during
breakfast
he
growled
about
his
lazy
men
and
after
the
meal
tried
to
urge
them
off
riggs
went
unwillingly
burt
refused
to
go
at
all
nix
i
footed
them
hills
all
i
to
he
said
an
from
now
on
i
rustle
my
own
the
leader
glared
his
reception
of
this
opposition
perhaps
his
sense
of
fairness
actuated
him
once
more
for
he
ordered
shady
and
moze
out
to
do
their
share
jim
you
the
best
tracker
in
this
outfit
suppose
you
go
suggested
anson
you
allus
used
to
be
the
first
one
times
has
changed
snake
was
the
imperturbable
reply
wal
wo
you
go
demanded
the
leader
impatiently
i
shore
wilson
did
not
look
or
intimate
in
any
way
that
he
would
not
leave
the
girl
in
camp
with
one
or
any
or
all
of
anson
gang
but
the
truth
was
as
significant
as
if
he
had
shouted
it
the
moze
gave
wilson
a
sinister
look
boss
ai
it
funny
how
a
pretty
wench
began
shady
jones
sarcastically
shut
up
you
fool
broke
in
anson
come
on
i
help
rustle
them
after
they
had
gone
burt
took
his
rifle
and
strolled
off
into
the
forest
then
the
girl
appeared
her
hair
was
down
her
face
pale
with
dark
shadows
she
asked
for
water
to
wash
her
face
wilson
pointed
to
the
brook
and
as
she
walked
slowly
toward
it
he
took
a
comb
and
a
clean
scarf
from
his
pack
and
carried
them
to
her
upon
her
return
to
the
she
looked
very
different
with
her
hair
arranged
and
the
red
stains
in
her
cheeks
miss
air
you
hungry
asked
wilson
yes
i
am
she
replied
he
helped
her
to
portions
of
bread
venison
and
gravy
and
a
cup
of
coffee
evidently
she
relished
the
meat
but
she
had
to
force
down
the
rest
where
are
they
all
she
asked
rustlin
the
probably
she
divined
that
he
did
not
want
to
talk
for
the
fleeting
glance
she
gave
him
attested
to
a
thought
that
his
voice
or
demeanor
had
changed
presently
she
sought
a
seat
under
the
out
of
the
sun
and
the
smoke
continually
blowing
in
her
face
and
there
she
stayed
a
forlorn
little
figure
for
all
the
resolute
lips
and
defiant
eyes
the
texan
paced
to
and
fro
beside
the
with
bent
head
and
hands
locked
behind
him
but
for
the
swinging
gun
he
would
have
resembled
a
lanky
farmer
coatless
and
hatless
with
his
brown
vest
open
his
trousers
stuck
in
the
top
of
the
high
boots
and
neither
he
nor
the
girl
changed
their
positions
relatively
for
a
long
time
at
length
however
after
peering
into
the
woods
and
listening
he
remarked
to
the
girl
that
he
would
be
back
in
a
moment
and
then
walked
off
around
the
spruces
no
sooner
had
he
disappeared
in
fact
so
quickly
that
it
presupposed
design
instead
of
accident
than
riggs
came
running
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
glade
he
ran
straight
to
the
girl
who
sprang
to
her
feet
i
hid
two
of
the
horses
he
panted
husky
with
excitement
take
two
saddles
you
grab
some
grub
we
run
for
no
she
cried
stepping
back
but
it
not
safe
for
us
here
he
said
hurriedly
glancing
all
around
i
take
you
home
i
swear
not
safe
i
tell
you
this
gang
after
me
hurry
he
laid
hold
of
two
saddles
one
with
each
hand
the
moment
had
reddened
his
face
brightened
his
eyes
made
his
action
strong
i
safer
here
with
this
outlaw
gang
she
replied
you
wo
come
his
color
began
to
lighten
then
and
his
face
to
distort
he
dropped
his
hold
on
the
saddles
harve
riggs
i
rather
become
a
toy
and
a
rag
for
these
ruffians
than
spend
an
hour
alone
with
you
she
flashed
at
him
in
unquenchable
hate
i
drag
you
he
seized
her
but
could
not
hold
her
breaking
away
she
screamed
help
that
whitened
his
face
drove
him
to
frenzy
leaping
forward
he
struck
her
a
hard
blow
across
the
mouth
it
staggered
her
and
tripping
on
a
saddle
she
fell
his
hands
flew
to
her
throat
ready
to
choke
her
but
she
lay
still
and
held
her
tongue
then
he
dragged
her
to
her
feet
hurry
now
grab
that
pack
an
follow
again
riggs
laid
hold
of
the
two
saddles
a
desperate
gleam
baleful
and
vainglorious
flashed
over
his
face
he
was
living
his
one
great
adventure
the
girl
eyes
dilated
they
looked
beyond
him
her
lips
opened
scream
again
an
i
kill
you
he
cried
hoarsely
and
swiftly
the
very
opening
of
her
lips
had
terrified
riggs
reckon
one
scream
was
enough
spoke
a
voice
slow
but
without
the
drawl
easy
and
cool
yet
incalculable
in
some
terrible
sense
riggs
wheeled
with
inarticulate
cry
wilson
stood
a
few
paces
off
with
his
gun
half
leveled
low
down
his
face
seemed
as
usual
only
his
eyes
held
a
quivering
light
intensity
like
boiling
molten
silver
girl
what
made
thet
blood
on
your
mouth
riggs
hit
me
she
whispered
then
at
something
she
feared
or
saw
or
divined
she
shrank
back
dropped
on
her
knees
and
crawled
into
the
spruce
shelter
wal
riggs
i
invite
you
to
draw
if
thet
be
any
use
said
wilson
this
speech
was
reflective
yet
it
hurried
a
little
riggs
could
not
draw
nor
move
nor
speak
he
seemed
turned
to
stone
except
his
jaw
which
slowly
fell
harve
riggs
gunman
from
down
missouri
way
continued
the
voice
of
incalculable
intent
reckon
you
looked
into
a
heap
of
in
your
day
shore
wal
look
in
this
heah
one
wilson
deliberately
leveled
the
gun
on
a
line
with
riggs
starting
eyes
was
you
heard
to
brag
in
turner
saloon
thet
you
could
see
lead
comin
an
dodge
it
shore
you
must
be
swift
dodge
this
heah
bullet
the
gun
spouted
flame
and
boomed
one
of
riggs
starting
popping
eyes
the
right
one
went
out
like
a
lamp
the
other
rolled
horribly
then
set
in
blank
dead
fixedness
riggs
swayed
in
slow
motion
until
a
lost
balance
felled
him
heavily
an
inert
mass
wilson
bent
over
the
prostrate
form
strange
violent
contrast
to
the
cool
scorn
of
the
preceding
moment
hissing
spitting
as
if
poisoned
by
passion
he
burst
with
the
hate
that
his
character
had
forbidden
him
to
express
on
a
living
counterfeit
wilson
was
shaken
as
if
by
a
palsy
he
choked
over
passionate
incoherent
invective
it
was
class
hate
first
then
the
hate
of
real
manhood
for
a
craven
then
the
hate
of
disgrace
for
a
murder
no
man
so
fair
as
a
in
the
western
creed
of
an
even
break
wilson
terrible
cataclysm
of
passion
passed
straightening
up
he
sheathed
his
weapon
and
began
a
slow
pace
before
the
fire
not
many
moments
afterward
he
jerked
his
head
high
and
listened
horses
were
softly
thudding
through
the
forest
soon
anson
rode
into
sight
with
his
men
and
one
of
the
strayed
horses
it
chanced
too
that
young
burt
appeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
glade
he
walked
quickly
as
one
who
anticipated
news
snake
anson
as
he
dismounted
espied
the
dead
man
jim
i
thought
i
heard
a
the
others
exclaimed
and
leaped
off
their
horses
to
view
the
prostrate
form
with
that
curiosity
and
strange
fear
common
to
all
men
confronted
by
sight
of
sudden
death
that
emotion
was
only
momentary
shot
his
lamp
out
ejaculated
moze
wonder
how
gunman
riggs
liked
thet
plumb
center
peg
exclaimed
shady
jones
with
a
hard
laugh
back
of
his
head
all
gone
gasped
young
burt
not
improbably
he
had
not
seen
a
great
many
men
jim
the
fool
did
try
to
draw
on
you
exclaimed
snake
anson
astounded
wilson
neither
spoke
nor
ceased
his
pacing
what
was
it
over
added
anson
curiously
he
hit
the
gurl
replied
wilson
then
there
were
exclamations
all
around
and
glance
met
glance
jim

saved
me
the
job
continued
the
outlaw
leader
an
i
much
obliged
fellars

and
considerable
gold
worn
in
a

waist
shady
jones
appropriated
his
boots
and
moze
his
gun
then
they
left
him
as
he
had
fallen
jim

have
to
track
them
lost
hosses
two
still
missin
an
one
of
them
mine
called
anson
as
wilson
paced
to
the
end
of
his
beat
the
girl
heard
anson
for
she
put
her
head
out
of
the
spruce
shelter
and
called
riggs
said
he
hid
two
of
the
horses

much
longer
hyar
than
he

lasted
in
texas
we
some
of
thet
great
country
right
in
our
the
girl
withdrew
her
white
face
it
break
camp
boys
was
the
leader
order
a
couple
of
you
look
up
them
hosses
they
be
hid
in
some
thick
spruces
the
rest
of
us
soon
the
gang
was
on
the
move
heading
toward
the
height
of
land
and
swerving
from
it
only
to
find
soft
and
grassy
ground
that
would
not
leave
any
tracks
they
did
not
travel
more
than
a
dozen
miles
during
the
afternoon
but
they
climbed
bench
after
bench
until
they
reached
the
timbered
plateau
that
stretched
in
sheer
black
slope
up
to
the
peaks
here
rose
the
great
and
gloomy
forest
of
firs
and
pines
with
the
spruce
overshadowed
and
thinned
out
the
last
hour
of
travel
was
tedious
and
toilsome
a
zigzag
winding
breaking
climbing
hunt
for
the
kind
of
suited
to
anson
fancy
he
seemed
to
be
growing
strangely
irrational
about
selecting
places
to
camp
at
last
for
no
reason
that
could
have
been
manifest
to
a
good
woodsman
he
chose
a
gloomy
bowl
in
the
center
of
the
densest
forest
that
had
been
traversed
the
opening
if
such
it
could
have
been
called
was
not
a
park
or
even
a
glade
a
dark
cliff
with
strange
holes
rose
to
one
side
but
not
so
high
as
the
lofty
pines
that
brushed
it
along
its
base
babbled
a
brook
running
over
such
formation
of
rock
that
from
different
points
near
at
hand
it
gave
forth
different
sounds
some
singing
others
melodious
and
one
at
least
of
a
hollow
weird
deep
sound
not
loud
but
strangely
penetrating
sure
spooky
i
say
observed
shady
sentiently
the
little
uplift
of
mood
coincident
with
the
rifling
of
person
had
not
worn
over
to
this
evening
camp
what
talk
the
outlaws
indulged
in
was
necessary
and
conducted
in
low
tones
the
place
enjoined
silence
wilson
performed
for
the
girl
very
much
the
same
service
as
he
had
the
night
before
only
he
advised
her
not
to
starve
herself
she
must
eat
to
keep
up
her
strength
she
complied
at
the
expense
of
considerable
effort
as
it
had
been
a
day
in
which
all
of
them
except
the
girl
had
climbed
miles
on
foot
they
did
not
linger
awake
long
enough
after
supper
to
learn
what
a
wild
weird
and
spot
the
outlaw
leader
had
chosen
the
little
spaces
of
open
ground
between
the
had
no
counterpart
up
in
the
lofty
spreading
foliage
not
a
star
could
blink
a
wan
ray
of
light
into
that
stygian
pit
the
wind
cutting
down
over
abrupt
heights
farther
up
sang
in
the
as
if
they
were
strings
vibrant
with
chords
dismal
creaks
were
audible
they
were
the
forest
sounds
of
branch
or
tree
rubbing
one
another
but
which
needed
the
corrective
medium
of
daylight
to
convince
any
human
that
they
were
other
than
ghostly
then
despite
the
wind
and
despite
the
changing
murmur
of
the
brook
there
seemed
to
be
a
silence
insulating
them
as
deep
and
impenetrable
as
the
darkness
but
the
outlaws
who
were
fugitives
now
slept
the
sleep
of
the
weary
and
heard
nothing
they
awoke
with
the
sun
when
the
forest
seemed
smoky
in
a
golden
gloom
when
light
and
bird
and
squirrel
proclaimed
the
day
the
horses
had
not
strayed
out
of
this
basin
during
the
night
a
circumstance
that
anson
was
not
slow
to
appreciate
it
ai
no
cheerful
camp
but
i
never
seen
a
safer
place
to
hole
up
in
he
remarked
to
wilson
wal
yes
if
any
place
is
safe
replied
that
ally
dubiously
we
can
watch
our
back
tracks
there
ai
any
other
way
to
git
in
hyar
thet
i
snake
we
was
tolerable
fair
but
we
no
good
anson
grumbled
his
disdain
of
this
comrade
who
had
once
been
his
mainstay
then
he
sent
burt
out
to
hunt
fresh
meat
and
engaged
his
other
men
at
cards
as
they
now
had
the
means
to
gamble
they
at
once
became
absorbed
wilson
smoked
and
divided
his
thoughtful
gaze
between
the
gamblers
and
the
drooping
figure
of
the
girl
the
morning
air
was
keen
and
she
evidently
not
caring
to
be
near
her
captors
beside
the
had
sought
the
only
sunny
spot
in
this
gloomy
dell
a
couple
of
hours
passed
the
sun
climbed
high
the
air
grew
warmer
once
the
outlaw
leader
raised
his
head
to
scan
the
slopes
that
inclosed
the
camp
jim
them
hosses
are
strayin
off
he
observed
wilson
leisurely
rose
and
stalked
off
across
the
small
open
patches
in
the
direction
of
the
horses
they
had
grazed
around
from
the
right
toward
the
outlet
of
the
brook
here
headed
a
ravine
dense
and
green
two
of
the
horses
had
gone
down
wilson
evidently
heard
them
though
they
were
not
in
sight
and
he
circled
somewhat
so
as
to
get
ahead
of
them
and
drive
them
back
the
invisible
brook
ran
down
over
the
rocks
with
murmur
and
babble
he
halted
with
instinctive
action
he
listened
forest
sounds
soft
lulling
came
on
the
warm
breeze
it
would
have
taken
no
keen
ear
to
hear
soft
and
rapid
padded
footfalls
he
moved
on
cautiously
and
turned
into
a
little
open
mossy
spot
and
odorous
full
of
ferns
and
bluebells
in
the
middle
of
this
deep
in
the
moss
he
espied
a
huge
round
track
of
a
cougar
he
bent
over
it
suddenly
he
stiffened
then
straightened
guardedly
at
that
instant
he
received
a
hard
prod
in
the
back
throwing
up
his
hands
he
stood
still
then
slowly
turned
a
tall
hunter
in
gray
buckskin
and
had
him
covered
with
a
cocked
rifle
and
beside
this
hunter
stood
a
monster
cougar
snarling
and
blinking
chapter

when

the
cougar
seemed
actuated
by
the
threatening
position
of
his
master
and
he
opened
his
mouth
showing
great
yellow
fangs
and
spat
at
wilson
the
outlaw
apparently
had
no
fear
of
dale
or
the
cocked
rifle
but
that
huge
snarling
cat
occasioned
him
uneasiness
wilson

with
an

made
him
sick

dale
hurriedly
she

an
shore
i
must
play
safe
shore
it
be
safer
to
have
a
wilson
shrewd
light
eyes
gleamed
with
an
idea
he
was
about
to
lower
one
of
his
upraised
hands
evidently
to
point
to
the
cougar
when
he
thought
better
of
that
anson
scared
of
cougars
mebbe
we
can
scare
him

the

so
it

thet
ai
so
good
if

the
big
cougar
spat
again
wilson
dropped
his
hands
and
stepping
forward
split
the
green
wall
of
intersecting
spruce
branches
then
he
turned
up
the
ravine
toward
the
glen
once
there
in
sight
of

he
began
to
speak
she
was
pale
sad
dull
of
eye
swiftly
with
his
words
she
was
transformed
and
when
he
had
ended
she
did
not
appear
the
same
girl
she
gave
him
one
blazing
flash
of
comprehension
and
nodded
her
head
rapidly
yes
i
understand

do
it
she
whispered
the
outlaw
turned
slowly
away
with
the
most
abstract
air
confounded
amid
his
shrewd
acting
and
he
did
not
collect
himself
until
back
to
his
comrades
then
beginning
to
hum
an
old
darky
tune
he
stirred
up
and
replenished
the
fire
and
set
about
preparation
for
the
midday
meal
but
he
did
not
miss
anything
going
on
around
him
he
saw
the
girl
go
into
her
shelter
and
come
out
with
her
hair
all
down
over
her
face
wilson
back
to
his
comrades
grinned
his
glee
and
he
wagged
his
head
as
if
he
thought
the
situation
was
developing
the
gambling
outlaws
however
did
not
at
once
see
the
girl
preening
herself
and
smoothing
her
long
hair
in
a
way
calculated
to
startle
busted
ejaculated
anson
with
a
curse
as
he
slammed
down
his
cards
if
i
ai
hoodooed
i
a
of
a
gambler
sartin
you

said
shady
jones
in
scorn

like
a

mud

moze

anson
with
pathetic
gravity

but
the
wust
end
of
everythin

the
boss
it
me
thet
snake
shore
it
was
the
gurl
deal
you
made
rejoined
wilson
who
had
listened
i
told
you
our
troubles
hev
only
begun
an
i
can
see
the
look
wilson
pointed
to
where
the
girl
stood
her
hair
flying
wildly
all
over
her
face
and
shoulders
she
was
making
most
elaborate
bows
to
an
old
stump
sweeping
the
ground
with
her
tresses
in
her
obeisance
anson
started
he
grew
utterly
astounded
his
amaze
was
ludicrous
and
the
other
two
men
looked
to
stare
to
equal
their
leader
bewilderment
what
hell
come
over
her
asked
anson
dubiously
must
hev
perked
up
but
she
ai
feelin
thet
gay
wilson
tapped
his
forehead
with
a
significant
finger
shore
i
was
scared
of
her
this
mawnin
he
whispered
naw
exclaimed
anson
incredulously
if
she
hai
queer
i
never
seen
no
queer
wimmin
vouchsafed
shady
jones
and
it
would
have
been
judged
by
the
way
he
wagged
his
head
that
he
had
been
all
his
days
familiar
with
women
moze
looked
beyond
words
and
quite
alarmed
i
seen
it
comin
declared
wilson
very
much
excited
but
i
was
scared
to
say
so
made
fun
of
me
aboot
her
now
i
shore
wish
i
had
spoken
anson
nodded
solemnly
he
did
not
believe
the
evidence
of
his
sight
but
the
facts
seemed
stunning
as
if
the
girl
were
a
dangerous
and
incomprehensible
thing
he
approached
her
step
by
step
wilson
followed
and
the
others
appeared
drawn
irresistibly
hey
thar
kid
called
anson
hoarsely
the
girl
drew
her
slight
form
up
haughtily
through
her
spreading
tresses
her
eyes
gleamed
unnaturally
upon
the
outlaw
leader
but
she
deigned
not
to
reply
hey
thar
you
rayner
girl
added
anson
lamely
what
ailin
you
my
lord
did
you
address
me
she
asked
loftily
shady
jones
got
over
his
consternation
and
evidently
extracted
some
humor
from
the
situation
as
his
dark
face
began
to
break
its
strain
aww
breathed
anson
heavily
ophelia
awaits
your
command
my
lord
i
been
gathering
flowers
she
said
sweetly
holding
up
her
empty
hands
as
if
they
contained
a
bouquet
shady
jones
exploded
in
convulsed
laughter
but
his
merriment
was
not
shared
and
suddenly
it
brought
disaster
upon
him
the
girl
flew
at
him
why
do
you
croak
you
toad
i
will
have
you
whipped
and
put
in
irons
you
scullion
she
cried
passionately
shady
underwent
a
remarkable
change
and
stumbled
in
his
backward
retreat
then
she
snapped
her
fingers
in
moze
face
you
black
devil
get
hence
avaunt
anson
plucked
up
courage
enough
to
touch
her
aww
now
ophelyar
probably
he
meant
to
try
to
humor
her
but
she
screamed
and
he
jumped
back
as
if
she
might
burn
him
she
screamed
shrilly
in
wild
staccato
notes
you
you
she
pointed
her
finger
at
the
outlaw
leader
you
brute
to
women
you
ran
off
from
your
wife
anson
turned
and
then
slowly
white
the
girl
must
have
sent
a
random
shot
home
and
now
the
devil
turned
you
into
a
snake
a
long
scaly
snake
with
green
eyes
uugh
you
crawl
on
your
belly
soon
when
my
cowboy
finds
you
and
he
tramp
you
in
the
she
floated
away
from
them
and
began
to
whirl
gracefully
arms
spread
and
hair
flying
and
then
apparently
oblivious
of
the
staring
men
she
broke
into
a
low
sweet
song
next
she
danced
around
a
pine
then
danced
into
her
little
green
inclosure
from
which
presently
she
sent
out
the
most
doleful
moans
aww
what
a
shame
burst
out
anson
thet
fine
healthy
nervy
kid
clean
gone
daffy
crazy
a
bedbug
shore
it
a
shame
protested
wilson
but
it
wuss
for
us
lord
if
we
was
hoodooed
before
what
will
we
be
now
did
i
tell
you
snake
anson
you
was
warned
ask
shady
an
moze
they
see
what
no
luck

our
way
predicted
shady
mournfully
it
beats
me
boss
it
beats
me
muttered
moze
a
crazy
woman
on
my
hands
if
thet
ai
the
last
straw
broke
out
anson
tragically
as
he
turned
away
ignorant
superstitious
worked
upon
by
things
as
they
seemed
the
outlaw
imagined
himself
at
last
beset
by
malign
forces
when
he
flung
himself
down
upon
one
of
the
packs
his
big
hands
shook
shady
and
moze
resembled
two
other
men
at
the
end
of
their
ropes
wilson
tense
face
twitched
and
he
averted
it
as
apparently
he
fought
off
a
paroxysm
of
some
nature
just
then
anson
swore
a
thundering
oath
crazy
or
not
i
git
gold
out
of
thet
kid
he
roared
but
man
talk
sense
are
you
gittin
daffy
too
i
declare

said
wilson
deliberately
why

make
no
dickers
why
in
another
day
or
so
we
be
dodgin
tracked
whar
you
git
thet
idee
as
soon
as
this
queried
anson
lifting
his
head
like
a
striking
snake
his
men
likewise
betrayed
sudden
interest
shore
it
no
idee
i
seen
any
one
but
i
feel
it
in
my
senses
i
hear
somebody
comin
a
step
on
our
trail

the
time

in
particular

a
big
posse
after
wal
if
i
see
or
hear
anythin
i
knock
the
girl
on
the
head
we
dig
out
of
hyar
replied
anson
sullenly
wilson
executed
a
swift
forward
motion
violent
and
passionate
so
utterly
unlike
what
might
have
been
looked
for
from
him
that
the
three
outlaws
gaped
then
you
shore
hev
to
knock
jim
wilson
on
the
haid
first
he
said
in
voice
as
strange
as
his
action
jim
you
would
go
back
on
me
implored
anson
with
uplifted
hands
in
a
dignity
of
pathos
i
losin
my
haid
too
an
you
shore

as
well
knock
it
in
you
hev
to
before
i
stand

thet
pore
little
gurl

only

replied
anson
fer
thet
matter
i
daffy
myself
aw
we
all
need
a
good
stiff
drink
of
so
he
tried
to
throw
off
gloom
and
apprehension
but
he
failed
his
comrades
did
not
rally
to
his
help
wilson
walked
away
nodding
his
head
boss
let
jim
alone
whispered
shady
it
orful
the
way
you
buck
him
when
you
seen
he
stirred
up
jim
true
blue
but
you
got
ta
be
moze
corroborated
this
statement
by
gloomy
nods
when
the
was
resumed
anson
did
not
join
the
game
and
both
moze
and
shady
evinced
little
of
that
obsession
which
usually
attended
their
gambling
anson
lay
at
length
his
head
in
a
saddle
scowling
at
the
little
shelter
where
the
captive
girl
kept
herself
out
of
sight
at
times
a
faint
song
or
laugh
very
unnatural
was
wafted
across
the
space
wilson
plodded
at
the
cooking
and
apparently
heard
no
sounds
presently
he
called
the
men
to
eat
which
office
they
surlily
and
silently
performed
as
if
it
was
a
favor
bestowed
upon
the
cook
snake
had
i
ought
to
take
a
bite
of
grub
over
to
the
gurl
asked
wilson
do
you
hev
to
ask
me
thet
snapped
anson
she
got
ta
be
fed
if
we
hev
to
stuff
it
down
her
wal
i
ai
stuck
on
the
job
replied
wilson
but
i
tackle
it
seein
got
cold
with
plate
and
cup
be
reluctantly
approached
the
little
and
kneeling
he
put
his
head
inside
the
girl
and
alert
had
evidently
seen
him
coming
at
any
rate
she
greeted
him
with
a
cautious
smile
jim
was
i
pretty
good
she
whispered
miss
you
was
shore
the
finest
aktress
i
ever
seen
he
responded
in
a
low
voice
but
you
dam
near
overdid
it
i
goin
to
tell
anson
sick
now
poisoned
or
somethin
awful
then
we
wait
till
night
dale
shore
will
help
us
oh
i
on
fire
to
get
away
she
exclaimed
jim
wilson
i
never
forget
you
as
long
as
i
live
he
seemed
greatly
embarrassed
wal
miss
i
i
do
my
best
licks
but
i
ai
gamblin
none
on
results
be
patient
keep
your
nerve
do
get
scared
i
reckon
between
me
an
dale
you
git
away
from
withdrawing
his
head
he
got
up
and
returned
to
the
where
anson
was
waiting
curiously
i
left
the
grub
but
she
did
touch
it
seems
sort
of
sick
to
me
like
she
was
jim
did
i
hear
you
talkin
asked
anson
shore
i
was
coaxin
her
reckon
she
ai
so
ranty
as
she
was
but
she
shore
is
an
wuss
an
wuss
all
the
time
said
anson
between
his
teeth
where
burt
hyar
it
noon
an
he
left
early
he
never
was
no
woodsman
he
got
either
thet
or
he
run
into
somethin
replied
wilson
thoughtfully
anson
doubled
a
huge
fist
and
cursed
deep
under
his
breath
the
reaction
of
a
man
whose
accomplices
and
partners
and
tools
whose
luck
whose
faith
in
himself
had
failed
him
he
flung
himself
down
under
a
tree
and
after
a
while
when
his
rigidity
relaxed
he
probably
fell
asleep
moze
and
shady
kept
at
their
game
wilson
paced
to
and
fro
sat
down
and
then
got
up
to
bunch
the
horses
again
walked
around
the
dell
and
back
to
camp
the
afternoon
hours
were
long
and
they
were
waiting
hours
the
act
of
waiting
appeared
on
the
surface
of
all
these
outlaws
did
at
sunset
the
golden
gloom
of
the
glen
changed
to
a
vague
thick
twilight
anson
rolled
over
yawned
and
sat
up
as
he
glanced
around
evidently
seeking
burt
his
face
clouded
no
sign
of
burt
he
asked
wilson
expressed
a
mild
surprise
wal
snake
you
ai
expectin
burt
now
i
am
course
i
am
why
not
demanded
anson
any
other
time
we
look
fer
him
would
we
any
other
time
ai
now
burt
wo
ever
come
back
wilson
spoke
it
with
a
positive
finality
some
more
of
them
queer
feelin
of
yourn
operatin
again
hey
them
onnatural
kind
thet
you
ca
explain
hey
anson
queries
were
bitter
and
rancorous
yes
an
snake
i
tax
you
with
this
heah
ai
any
of
them
queer
feelin
operatin
in
you
no
rolled
out
the
leader
savagely
but
his
passionate
denial
was
a
proof
that
he
lied
from
the
moment
of
this
outburst
which
was
a
fierce
clinging
to
the
old
brave
instincts
of
his
character
unless
a
sudden
change
marked
the
nature
of
his
fortunes
he
would
rapidly
deteriorate
to
the
and
in
such
brutal
unrestrained
natures
as
his
this
meant
a
desperate
stand
a
desperate
forcing
of
events
a
desperate
accumulation
of
passions
that
stalked
out
to
deal
and
to
meet
disaster
and
blood
and
death
wilson
put
a
little
wood
on
the
fire
and
he
munched
a
biscuit
no
one
asked
him
to
cook
no
one
made
any
effort
to
do
so
one
by
one
each
man
went
to
the
pack
to
get
some
bread
and
meat
then
they
waited
as
men
who
knew
not
what
they
waited
for
yet
hated
and
dreaded
it
twilight
in
that
glen
was
naturally
a
strange
veiled
condition
of
the
atmosphere
it
was
a
merging
of
shade
and
light
which
two
seemed
to
make
gray
creeping
shadows
suddenly
a
snorting
and
stamping
of
the
horses
startled
the
men
somethin
scared
the
hosses
said
anson
rising
come
moze
accompanied
him
and
they
disappeared
in
the
gloom
more
trampling
of
hoofs
was
heard
then
a
cracking
of
brush
and
the
deep
voices
of
men
at
length
the
two
outlaws
returned
leading
three
of
the
horses
which
they
haltered
in
the
open
glen
the
light
showed
anson
face
dark
and
serious
jim
them
hosses
are
wilder
deer
he
said
i
ketched
mine
moze
got
two
but
the
rest
worked
away
whenever
we
come
close
some
varmint
has
scared
them
bad
we
all
got
ta
rustle
out
thar
wilson
rose
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
and
at
that
moment
the
quiet
air
split
to
a
piercing
horrid
neigh
of
a
terrified
horse
prolonged
to
a
screech
it
broke
and
ended
then
followed
snorts
of
fright
pound
and
crack
and
thud
of
hoofs
and
crash
of
brush
then
a
gathering
thumping
crashing
roar
split
by
piercing
sounds
stampede
yelled
anson
and
he
ran
to
hold
his
own
horse
which
he
had
haltered
right
in
camp
it
was
big
and
and
now
reared
and
plunged
to
break
away
anson
just
got
there
in
time
and
then
it
took
all
his
weight
to
pull
the
horse
down
not
until
the
crashing
snorting
pounding
melee
had
subsided
and
died
away
over
the
rim
of
the
glen
did
anson
dare
leave
his
frightened
favorite
gone
our
horses
are
gone
did
you
hear
he
exclaimed
blankly
shore
they
a
an
crippled
bunch
by
now
replied
wilson
boss
we
never
git
back
not
a
hundred
years
declared
moze
thet
settles
us
snake
anson
stridently
added
shady
jones
them
hosses
are
gone
you
can
kiss
your
hand
to
them
they
was
hobbled
they
hed
an
orful
scare
they
split
on
thet
stampede
an
they
never
git
together
see
what
you
fetched
us
to
under
the
force
of
this
triple
arraignment
the
outlaw
leader
dropped
to
his
seat
staggered
and
silenced
in
fact
silence
fell
upon
all
the
men
and
likewise
enfolded
the
glen
night
set
in
dismal
lonely
without
a
star
faintly
the
wind
moaned
weirdly
the
brook
babbled
through
its
strange
chords
to
end
in
the
sound
that
was
hollow
it
was
never
the
same
a
rumble
as
if
faint
distant
thunder
a
deep
gurgle
as
of
water
drawn
into
a
vortex
a
rolling
as
of
a
stone
in
swift
current
the
black
cliff
was
invisible
yet
seemed
to
have
many
weird
faces
the
giant
pines
loomed
spectral
the
shadows
were
thick
moving
changing
flickering
lights
from
the
circled
the
huge
trunks
and
played
fantastically
over
the
brooding
men
this
did
not
burn
or
blaze
cheerily
it
had
no
glow
no
sputter
no
white
heart
no
red
living
embers
one
by
one
the
outlaws
as
if
with
common
consent
tried
their
hands
at
making
the
fire
burn
aright
what
little
wood
had
been
collected
was
old
it
would
burn
up
with
false
flare
only
to
die
quickly
after
a
while
not
one
of
the
outlaws
spoke
or
stirred
not
one
smoked
their
gloomy
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
fire
each
one
was
concerned
with
his
own
thoughts
his
own
lonely
soul
unconsciously
full
of
a
doubt
of
the
future
that
brooding
hour
severed
him
from
comrade
at
night
nothing
seemed
the
same
as
it
was
by
day
with
success
and
plenty
with
action
past
and
more
in
store
these
outlaws
were
as
different
from
their
present
state
as
this
black
night
was
different
from
the
bright
day
they
waited
for
wilson
though
he
played
a
deep
game
of
deceit
for
the
sake
of
the
helpless
girl
and
thus
did
not
have
haunting
and
superstitious
fears
on
her
account
was
probably
more
conscious
of
impending
catastrophe
than
any
of
them
the
evil
they
had
done
spoke
in
the
voice
of
nature
out
of
the
darkness
and
was
interpreted
by
each
according
to
his
hopes
and
fears
fear
was
their
predominating
sense
for
years
they
had
lived
with
some
species
of
fear
of
honest
men
or
vengeance
of
pursuit
of
starvation
of
lack
of
drink
or
gold
of
blood
and
death
of
stronger
men
of
luck
of
chance
of
fate
of
mysterious
nameless
force
wilson
was
the
type
of
fearless
spirit
but
he
endured
the
most
gnawing
and
implacable
fear
of
all
that
of
himself
that
he
must
inevitably
fall
to
deeds
beneath
his
manhood
so
they
hunched
around
the
brooding
because
hope
was
at
lowest
ebb
listening
because
the
weird
black
silence
with
its
moan
of
wind
and
hollow
laugh
of
brook
compelled
them
to
hear
waiting
for
sleep
for
the
hours
to
pass
for
whatever
was
to
come
and
it
was
anson
who
caught
the
first
intimation
of
an
impending
doom
chapter
xxiii
listen
anson
whispered
tensely
his
poise
was
motionless
his
eyes
roved
everywhere
he
held
up
a
shaking
bludgy
finger
to
command
silence
a
third
and
stranger
sound
accompanied
the
low
weird
moan
of
the
wind
and
the
hollow
mockery
of
the
brook
and
it
seemed
a
barely
perceptible
exquisitely
delicate
wail
or
whine
it
filled
in
the
lulls
between
the
other
sounds
if
thet
some
varmint
he
close
whispered
anson
but
shore
it
far
off
said
wilson
shady
jones
and
moze
divided
their
opinions
in
the
same
way
all
breathed
freer
when
the
wail
ceased
relaxing
to
their
former
lounging
positions
around
the
fire
an
impenetrable
wall
of
blackness
circled
the
pale
space
lighted
by
the
and
this
circle
contained
the
dark
somber
group
of
men
in
the
center
the
dying
and
a
few
spectral
trunks
of
pines
and
the
tethered
horses
on
the
outer
edge
the
horses
scarcely
moved
from
their
tracks
and
their
erect
alert
heads
attested
to
their
sensitiveness
to
the
peculiarities
of
the
night
then
at
an
unusually
quiet
lull
the
strange
sound
gradually
arose
to
a
wailing
whine
it
thet
crazy
wench
cryin
declared
the
outlaw
leader
apparently
his
allies
accepted
that
statement
with
as
much
relief
as
they
had
expressed
for
the
termination
of
the
sound
shore
thet
must
be
it
agreed
jim
wilson
gravely
we
git
a
lot
of
sleep
with
thet
gurl
whinin
all
night
growled
shady
jones
she
gives
me
the
creeps
said
moze
wilson
got
up
to
resume
his
pondering
walk
head
bent
hands
behind
his
back
a
grim
realistic
figure
of
perturbation
jim
set
down
you
make
me
nervous
said
anson
irritably
wilson
actually
laughed
but
low
as
if
to
keep
his
strange
mirth
well
confined

six
seconds

like
them
anson
lean
jaw
dropped
the
other
two
outlaws
stared
with
round
eyes
wilson
was
not
drunk
they
evidently
knew
but
what
he
really
was
appeared
a
mystery
jim
wilson
are
you
showin
yellow
queried
anson
hoarsely
mebbe
the
lord
only

but
listen
heah
snake

grimly
but
you

of
shock
of
an
orful
scare
no
i
reckon
i
never
i
have
an
thet
what
ailin
jim
wilson
and
he
resumed
his
dogged
steps
anson
and
his
two
comrades
exchanged
bewildered
glances
with
one
another
say
what
thet
got
to
do
with
us
hyar
asked
anson
presently
thet
gurl
is
dyin
retorted
wilson
in
a
voice
cracking
like
a
whip
the
three
outlaws
stiffened
in
their
seats
incredulous
yet
irresistibly
swayed
by
emotions
that
stirred
to
this
dark
lonely
hour
wilson
trudged
to
the
edge
of
the
lighted
circle
muttering
to
himself
and
came
back
again
then
he
trudged
farther
this
time
almost
out
of
sight
but
only
to
return
the
third
time
he
vanished
in
the
impenetrable
wall
of
light
the
three
men
scarcely
moved
a
muscle
as
they
watched
the
place
where
he
had
disappeared
in
a
few
moments
he
came
stumbling
back
shore
she
almost
gone
he
said
dismally
it
took
my
nerve
but
i
felt
of
her
face
thet
orful
wail
is
her
breath
chokin
in
her
throat
like
a
only
long
instead
of
wal
if
she
got
ta
croak
it
good
she
gits
it
over
quick
replied
anson
i
hed
sleep
fer
three
nights
an
what
i
need
is
snake
thet
gospel
you
spoutin
remarked
shady
jones
morosely
the
direction
of
sound
in
the
glen
was
difficult
to
be
assured
of
but
any
man
not
stirred
to
a
high
pitch
of
excitement
could
have
told
that
the
difference
in
volume
of
this
strange
wail
must
have
been
caused
by
different
distances
and
positions
also
when
it
was
loudest
it
was
most
like
a
whine
but
these
outlaws
heard
with
their
consciences
at
last
it
ceased
abruptly
wilson
again
left
the
group
to
be
swallowed
up
by
the
night
his
absence
was
longer
than
usual
but
he
returned
hurriedly
she
daid
he
exclaimed
solemnly
thet
innocent
kid
who
never
harmed
no
one
an
who

any
man
better

daid
anson

angrily

wilson
shaking
his

medicine

all
along

i

declared
anson
shaking
his
long
frame
as
he
rose
gim
me
a
boss
you
plumb
off
to
go
near
a
dead
gurl
thet
jest

crazy
protested
shady
jones
off
haw
haw
who
ai
off
in
this
outfit
i
like
to
know
anson
possessed
himself
of
a
stick
blazing
at
one
and
and
with
this
he
stalked
off
toward
the
where
the
girl
was
supposed
to
be
dead
his
gaunt
figure
lighted
by
the
torch
certainly
fitted
the
weird
black
surroundings
and
it
was
seen
that
once
near
the
girl
shelter
he
proceeded
more
slowly
until
he
halted
he
bent
to
peer
inside
she
gone
he
yelled
in
harsh
shaken
accents
than
the
torch
burned
out
leaving
only
a
red
glow
he
whirled
it
about
but
the
blaze
did
not
rekindle
his
comrades
peering
intently
lost
sight
of
his
tall
form
and
the
end
of
the
stick
darkness
like
pitch
swallowed
him
for
a
moment
no
sound
intervened
again
the
moan
of
wind
the
strange
little
mocking
hollow
roar
dominated
the
place
then
there
came
a
rush
of
something
perhaps
of
air
like
the
soft
swishing
of
spruce
branches
swinging
aside
dull
thudding
footsteps
followed
it
anson
came
running
back
to
the
fire
his
aspect
was
wild
his
face
pale
his
eyes
were
fierce
and
starting
from
their
sockets
he
had
drawn
his
gun
did
ye
see
er
hear
anythin
he
panted
peering
back
then
all
around
and
at
last
at
his
man

replied
wilson

gray
streak

crazier
thet

exclaimed
wilson
in
great
alarm
fellars
if

then
mebbe
she

an
she
wandered
off
but
she
was
daid
her
heart

beatin
i
swear
to

move
to
break
camp
said
shady
jones
gruffly
and
he
stood
up
moze
seconded
that
move
by
an
expressive
flash
of
his
black
visage
jim
if
she
dead
an
gone
what
hell

off
huskily
asked
anson
it
only
seems
thet

to
another
end
i
tell
you
i
ai
surprised
thar
cried
anson
whirling
with
his
gun
leaping
out
something
huge
shadowy
gray
against
the
black
rushed
behind
the
men
and
trees
and
following
it
came
a
perceptible
acceleration
of
the
air
shore
snake
there
was
nothin
said
wilson
i
heerd
whispered
shady
jones
it
was
only
a
breeze
blowin
thet
smoke
rejoined
moze
i
bet
my
soul
somethin
went
back
of
me
declared
anson
glaring
into
the
void
listen
an
let
make
shore
suggested
wilson
the
guilty
agitated
faces
of
the
outlaws
showed
plain
enough
in
the
flickering
light
for
each
to
see
a
convicting
dread
in
his
fellow
like
statues
they
stood
watching
and
listening
few
sounds
stirred
in
the
strange
silence
now
and
then
the
horses
heaved
heavily
but
stood
still
a
dismal
dreary
note
of
the
wind
in
the
pines
vied
with
a
hollow
laugh
of
the
brook
and
these
low
sounds
only
fastened
attention
upon
the
quality
of
the
silence
a
breathing
lonely
spirit
of
solitude
permeated
the
black
dell
like
a
pit
of
unplumbed
depths
the
dark
night
yawned
an
evil
conscience
listening
there
could
have
heard
the
most
peaceful
beautiful
and
mournful
sounds
of
nature
only
as
strains
of
a
calling
hell
suddenly
the
silent
oppressive
surcharged
air
split
to
a
short
piercing
scream
anson
big
horse
stood
up
straight
pawing
the
air
and
came
down
with
a
crash
the
other
horses
shook
with
terror
was
thet
a
cougar
whispered
anson
thickly
thet
was
a
woman
scream
replied
wilson
and
he
appeared
to
be
shaking
like
a
leaf
in
the
wind
then
i
figgered
right
the
kid
alive
wonderin
around
an
she
let
out
thet
orful
scream
said
anson
wonderin
yes
but
she
daid
my
gawd
it
ai
possible
wal
if
she
ai
wonderin
round
daid
she
almost
daid
replied
wilson
and
he
began
to
whisper
to
himself
if
i
only
knowed
what
thet
deal
meant
i
hev
plugged
beasley
instead
of
listenin
an
i
ought
to
hev
knocked
thet
kid
on
the
head
made
sartin
she
croaked
if
she
goes
screamin
thet
way
his
voice
failed
as
there
rose
a
thin
splitting
shriek
somewhat
resembling
the
first
scream
only
less
wild
it
came
apparently
from
the
cliff
from
another
point
in
the
glen
rose
the
wailing
terrible
cry
of
a
woman
in
agony
wild
haunting
mournful
wail
anson
horse
loosing
the
halter
plunged
back
almost
falling
over
a
slight
depression
in
the
rocky
ground
the
outlaw
caught
him
and
dragged
him
nearer
the
fire
the
other
horses
stood
shaking
and
straining
moze
ran
between
them
and
held
them
shady
jones
threw
green
brush
on
the
fire
with
sputter
and
crackle
a
blaze
started
showing
wilson
standing
tragically
his
arms
out
facing
the
black
shadows
the
strange
live
shriek
was
not
repeated
but
the
cry
like
that
of
a
woman
in
her
pierced
the
silence
again
it
left
a
quivering
ring
that
softly
died
away
then
the
stillness
clamped
down
once
more
and
the
darkness
seemed
to
thicken
the
men
waited
and
when
they
had
begun
to
relax
the
cry
burst
out
appallingly
close
right
behind
the
trees
it
was
human
the
personification
of
pain
and
terror
the
tremendous
struggle
of
precious
life
against
horrible
death
so
pure
so
exquisite
so
wonderful
was
the
cry
that
the
listeners
writhed
as
if
they
saw
an
innocent
tender
beautiful
girl
torn
frightfully
before
their
eyes
it
was
full
of
suspense
it
thrilled
for
death
its
marvelous
potency
was
the
wild
note
that
beautiful
and
ghastly
note
of
in
sheer
desperation
the
outlaw
leader
fired
his
gun
at
the
black
wall
whence
the
cry
came
then
he
had
to
fight
his
horse
to
keep
him
from
plunging
away
following
the
shot
was
an
interval
of
silence
the
horses
became
tractable
the
men
gathered
closer
to
the
fire
with
the
halters
still
held
firmly
if
it
was
a
cougar
thet
scare
him
off
said
anson
shore
but
it
ai
a
cougar
replied
wilson
wait
an
see
they
all
waited
listening
with
ears
turned
to
different
points
eyes
roving
everywhere
afraid
of
their
very
shadows
once
more
the
moan
of
wind
the
mockery
of
brook
deep
gurgle
laugh
and
babble
dominated
the
silence
of
the
glen
boss
let
shake
this
spooky
hole
whispered
moze
the
suggestion
attracted
anson
and
he
pondered
it
while
slowly
shaking
his
head

hosses

the
leader

declared
shady
jones
jim
what
d
say
to
thet
queried
anson
rustlin
out
of
this
black
hole
shore
it
a
grand
idee
agreed
wilson
thet
was
a
cougar
avowed
anson
gathering
courage
as
the
silence
remained
unbroken
but
jest
the
same
it
was
as
tough
on
me
as
if
it
hed
been
a
woman
screamin
over
a
blade
twistin
in
her
snake
shore
you

if

what
do

blab
about

for
wilson
argument
seemed
incontestable
shady
and
moze
nodded
gloomily
and
shifted
restlessly
from
foot
to
foot
anson
dropped
his
head
no
matter
if
we
only
do
hear
he
began
suddenly
to
grow
mute
right
upon
them
from
some
place
just
out
the
circle
of
light
rose
a
scream
by
reason
of
its
proximity
the
most
piercing
and
agonizing
yet
heard
simply
petrifying
the
group
until
the
peal
passed
anson
huge
horse
reared
and
with
a
snort
of
terror
lunged
in
tremendous
leap
straight
out
he
struck
anson
with
thudding
impact
knocking
him
over
the
rocks
into
the
depression
back
of
the
and
plunging
after
him
wilson
had
made
a
flying
leap
just
in
time
to
avoid
being
struck
and
he
turned
to
see
anson
go
down
there
came
a
crash
a
groan
and
then
the
strike
and
pound
of
hoofs
as
the
horse
struggled
up
apparently
he
had
rolled
over
his
master
help
fellars
yelled
wilson
quick
to
leap
down
over
the
little
bank
and
in
the
dim
light
to
grasp
the
halter
the
three
men
dragged
the
horse
out
and
securely
tied
him
close
to
a
tree
that
done
they
peered
down
into
the
depression
anson
form
could
just
barely
be
distinguished
in
the
gloom
he
lay
stretched
out
another
groan
escaped
him
shore
i
scared
he
hurt
said
wilson
hoss
rolled
right
on
top
of
him
an
thet
hoss
heavy
declared
moze
they
got
down
and
knelt
beside
their
leader
in
the
darkness
his
face
looked
dull
gray
his
breathing
was
not
right
snake
old
man
you
ai
hurt
asked
wilson
with
a
tremor
in
his
voice
receiving
no
reply
he
said
to
his
comrades
lay
hold
an
heft
him
up
where
we
can
the
three
men
carefully
lifted
anson
up
on
the
bank
and
laid
him
near
the
fire
in
the
light
anson
was
conscious
his
face
was
ghastly
blood
showed
on
his
lips
wilson
knelt
beside
him
the
other
outlaws
stood
up
and
with
one
dark
gaze
at
one
another
damned
anson
chance
of
life
and
on
the
instant
rose
that
terrible
distressing
scream
of
acute
agony
like
that
of
a
woman
being
dismembered
shady
jones

at
their
fallen
leader

broken

wilson
deft

outlaw
shirt

felt
of
his
chest

replied
wilson
hopefully
and
he
began
to
run
his
hand
around
one
side
of
anson
body
and
then
the
other
abruptly
he
stopped
averted
his
gaze
then
slowly
ran
the
hand
all
along
that
side
anson
ribs
had
been
broken
and
crushed
in
by
the
weight
of
the
horse
he
was
bleeding
at
the
mouth
and
his
slow
painful
expulsions
of
breath
brought
a
bloody
froth
which
showed
that
the
broken
bones
had
penetrated
the
lungs
an
injury
sooner
or
later

cheerfulness
his

a
short
scrutiny
of
that
ghastly
face
at

the
lean

at
nothing

they
untied

two
horses
and
led

up
to
where

swiftly
the
blankets

on

the
saddles
swung
up
swiftly
the
cinches

anson
lay
gazing
up
at
wilson
comprehending
this
move
and
wilson
stood
strangely
grim
and
silent
somehow
detached
coldly
from
that
self
of
the
past

hours
shady

sardonically
returned
moze
a
current
leaped
all
through
anson
stretched
frame
his
ghastly
face
blazed
that
was
the
great
and
the
terrible
moment
which
for
long
had
been
in
abeyance
wilson
had
known
grimly
that
it
would
come
by
one
means
or
another
anson
had
doggedly
and
faithfully
struggled
against
the
tide
of
fatal
issues
moze
and
shady
jones
deep
locked
in
their
motives
had
not
realized
the
inevitable
trend
of
their
dark
lives
anson
prostrate
as
he
was
swiftly
drew
his
gun
and
shot
moze
without
sound
or
movement
of
hand
moze
fell
then
the
plunge
of
shady
horse
caused
anson
second
shot
to
miss
a
quick
third
shot
brought
no
apparent
result
but
shady
cursing
resort
to
his
own
weapon
he
tried
to
aim
from
his
plunging
horse
his
bullets
spattered
dust
and
gravel
over
anson
then
wilson
long
arm
stretched
and
his
heavy
gun
banged
shady
collapsed
in
the
saddle
and
the
frightened
horse
throwing
him
plunged
out
of
the
circle
of
light
thudding
hoofs
crashings
of
brush
quickly
ceased
jim
did
you
git
him
whispered
anson
shore
did
snake
was
the
slow
halting
response
jim
wilson
must
have
sustained
a
sick
shudder
as
he
replied
sheathing
his
gun
he
folded
a
blanket
and
put
it
under
anson
head
jim
my
feet
air
orful
cold

wilson
and
taking
a

now
thet
was
a
i
knowed
it
wilson
stalked
away
into
the
darkness
that
inky
wall
did
not
seem
so
impenetrable
and
black
after
he
had
gotten
out
of
the
circle
of
light
he
proceeded
carefully
and
did
not
make
any
missteps
he
groped
from
tree
to
tree
toward
the
cliff
and
presently
brought
up
against
a
huge
flat
rock
as
high
as
his
head
here
the
darkness
was
blackest
yet
he
was
able
to
see
a
light
form
on
the
rock
miss
are
you
there
all
right
he
called
softly
yes
but
i
scared
to
death
she
whispered
in
reply
shore
it
wound
up
sudden
come
now
i
reckon
your
trouble
he
helped
her
off
the
rock
and
finding
her
unsteady
on
her
feet
he
supported
her
with
one
arm
and
held
the
other
out
in
front
of
him
to
feel
for
objects
foot
by
foot
they
worked
out
from
under
the
dense
shadow
of
the
cliff
following
the
course
of
the
little
brook
it
babbled
and
gurgled
and
almost
drowned
the
low
whistle
wilson
sent
out
the
girl
dragged
heavily
upon
him
now
evidently
weakening
at
length
he
reached
the
little
open
patch
at
the
head
of
the
ravine
halting
here
he
whistled
an
answer
came
from
somewhere
behind
him
and
to
the
right
wilson
waited
with
the
girl
hanging
on
his
arm
dale
heah
he
said
an
do
you
keel
over
now
after
all
the
nerve
you
a
swishing
of
brush
a
step
a
soft
padded
footfall
a
looming
dark
figure
and
a
long
low
gray
shape
stealthily
moving
it
was
the
last
of
these
that
made
wilson
jump
wilson
came
dale
subdued
voice
heah
i
got
her
dale

sound
replied
wilson
stepping
toward
the
tall
form
and
he
put
the
drooping
girl
into
dale
arms
bo
bo
you
all
right
dale
deep
voice
was
tremulous
she
roused
up
to
seize
him
and
to
utter
little
cries
of
joy
oh

oh
thank
heaven
i
ready
to
drop

a
cool

tremulous
the

flashed
white
in
the
gloom
she
pressed
against
the
outlaw

pale
glow
of

the
black
pines
chapter
xxiv
as
helen
rayner
watched
dale
ride
away
on
a
quest
perilous
to
him
and
which
meant
almost
life
or
death
for
her
it
was
surpassing
strange
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
except
the
thrilling
tumultuous
moment
when
she
had
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
it
did
not
matter
that
dale
splendid
fellow
that
he
was
had
made
the
ensuing
moment
free
of
shame
by
taking
her
action
as
he
had
taken
it
the
fact
that
she
had
actually
done
it
was
enough
how
utterly
impossible
for
her
to
anticipate
her
impulses
or
to
understand
them
once
they
were
acted
upon
confounding
realization
then
was
that
when
dale
returned
with
her
sister
helen
knew
she
would
do
the
same
thing
over
again
if
i
do
i
wo
be
about
it
she
soliloquized
and
a
hot
blush
flamed
her
cheeks
she
watched
dale
until
he
rode
out
of
sight
when
he
had
gone
worry
and
dread
replaced
this
other
confusing
emotion
she
turned
to
the
business
of
meeting
events
before
supper
she
packed
her
valuables
and
books
papers
and
clothes
together
with
bo
and
had
them
in
readiness
so
if
she
was
forced
to
vacate
the
premises
she
would
have
her
personal
possessions
the
mormon
boys
and
several
other
of
her
trusted
men
slept
in
their
tarpaulin
beds
on
the
porch
of
the
that
night
so
that
helen
at
least
would
not
be
surprised
but
the
day
came
with
its
manifold
duties
undisturbed
by
any
event
and
it
passed
slowly
with
the
leaden
feet
of
listening
watching
vigilance
carmichael
did
not
come
back
nor
was
there
news
of
him
to
be
had
the
last
known
of
him
had
been
late
the
afternoon
of
the
preceding
day
when
a
had
seen
him
far
out
on
the
north
range
headed
for
the
hills
the
beemans
reported
that
roy
condition
had
improved
and
also
that
there
was
a
subdued
excitement
of
suspense
down
in
the
village
this
second
lonely
night
was
almost
unendurable
for
helen
when
she
slept
it
was
to
dream
horrible
dreams
when
she
lay
awake
it
was
to
have
her
heart
leap
to
her
throat
at
a
rustle
of
leaves
near
the
window
and
to
be
in
torture
of
imagination
as
to
poor
bo
plight
a
thousand
times
helen
said
to
herself
that
beasley
could
have
had
the
ranch
and
welcome
if
only
bo
had
been
spared
helen
absolutely
connected
her
enemy
with
her
sister
disappearance
riggs
might
have
been
a
means
to
it
daylight
was
not
attended
by
so
many
fears
there
were
things
to
do
that
demanded
attention
and
thus
it
was
that
the
next
morning
shortly
before
noon
she
was
recalled
to
her
perplexities
by
a
shouting
out
at
the
corrals
and
a
galloping
of
horses
somewhere
near
from
the
window
she
saw
a
big
smoke
fire
that
must
be
one
of
the
barns
the
old
one
farthest
out
she
said
gazing
out
of
the
window
some
careless
mexican
with
his
everlasting
cigarette
helen
resisted
an
impulse
to
go
out
and
see
what
had
happened
she
had
decided
to
stay
in
the
house
but
when
footsteps
sounded
on
the
porch
and
a
rap
on
the
door
she
unhesitatingly
opened
it
four
mexicans
stood
close
one
of
them
quick
as
thought
flashed
a
hand
in
to
grasp
her
and
in
a
single
motion
pulled
her
across
the
threshold
no
hurt
senora
he
said
and
pointed
making
motions
she
must
go
helen
did
not
need
to
be
told
what
this
visit
meant
many
as
her
conjectures
had
been
however
she
had
not
thought
of
beasley
subjecting
her
to
this
outrage
and
her
blood
boiled
how
dare
you
she
said
trembling
in
her
effort
to
control
her
temper
but
class
authority
voice
availed
nothing
with
these
swarthy
mexicans
they
grinned
another
laid
hold
of
helen
with
dirty
brown
hand
she
shrank
from
the
contact
let
go
she
burst
out
furiously
and
instinctively
she
began
to
struggle
to
free
herself
then
they
all
took
hold
of
her
dignity
might
never
have
been
a
burning
choking
rush
of
blood
was
her
first
acquaintance
with
the
terrible
passion
of
anger
that
was
her
inheritance
from
the
auchinclosses
she
who
had
resolved
never
to
lay
herself
open
to
indignity
now
fought
like
a
tigress
the
mexicans
jabbering
in
their
excitement
had
all
they
could
do
until
they
lifted
her
bodily
from
the
porch
they
handled
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
sack
of
corn
one
holding
each
hand
and
foot
they
packed
her
with
dress
disarranged
and
half
torn
off
down
the
path
to
the
lane
and
down
the
lane
to
the
road
there
they
stood
upright
and
pushed
her
off
her
property
through
eyes
helen
saw
them
guarding
the
gateway
ready
to
prevent
her
entrance
she
staggered
down
the
road
to
the
village
it
seemed
she
made
her
way
through
a
red
dimness
that
there
was
a
congestion
in
her
brain
that
the
distance
to
cass
cottage
was
insurmountable
but
she
got
there
to
stagger
up
the
path
to
hear
the
old
woman
cry
dizzy
faint
sick
with
a
blackness
enveloping
all
she
looked
at
helen
felt
herself
led
into
the
and
placed
in
the
big
chair
presently
sight
and
clearness
of
mind
returned
to
her
she
saw
roy
white
as
a
sheet
questioning
her
with
terrible
eyes
the
old
woman
hung
murmuring
over
her
trying
to
comfort
her
as
well
as
fasten
the
disordered
dress
four
greasers
packed
me
down
the
hill
threw
me
off
my
ranch
into
the
road
panted
helen
she
seemed
to
tell
this
also
to
her
own
consciousness
and
to
realize
the
mighty
wave
of
danger
that
shook
her
whole
body
if
i
known
i
would
have
killed
them
she
exclaimed
that
and
hard
with
dry
hot
eyes
on
her
friends
roy
reached
out
to
take
her
hand
speaking
huskily
helen
did
not
distinguish
what
he
said
the
frightened
old
woman
knelt
with
unsteady
fingers
fumbling
over
the
rents
in
helen
dress
the
moment
came
when
helen
quivering
began
to
subside
when
her
blood
quieted
to
let
her
reason
sway
when
she
began
to
do
battle
with
her
rage
and
slowly
to
take
fearful
stock
of
this
consuming
peril
that
had
been
a
sleeping
tigress
in
her
veins
oh
miss
helen
you
looked
so
turrible
i
made
sure
you
was
hurted
the
old
woman
was
saying
helen
gazed
strangely
at
her
bruised
wrists
at
the
one
stocking
that
hung
down
over
her
at
the
rent
which
had
bared
her
shoulder
to
the
profane
gaze
of
those
grinning
mexicans
my
body
not
hurt
she
whispered
roy
had
lost
some
of
his
whiteness
and
where
his
eyes
had
been
fierce
they
were
now
kind
wal
miss
nell
it
lucky
no
harm
done
now
if

whole
deal

sweet
way
of
lookin
hopin
if
you
can
only
see
what
raw
in
this
west
an
love
it
jest
the
same
helen
only
half
divined
his
meaning
but
that
was
enough
for
a
future
reflection
the
west
was
beautiful
but
hard
in
the
faces
of
these
friends
she
began
to
see
the
meaning
of
the
keen
sloping
lines
and
shadows
of
pain
of
a
lean
naked
truth
cut
as
from
marble
for
the
land
sakes
tell
us
all
about
it
importuned
cass
whereupon
helen
shut
her
eyes
and
told
the
brief
narrative
of
her
expulsion
from
her
home

his
chances
fer
long
life
are
as
pore
as
his
chances
fer
heaven
but
roy
i
do
believe
in
deliberate
taking
of
life
replied
helen
shuddering
that
against
my
religion
i
wo
allow
it
and
then
think
dale
all
of
you
in
danger
girl
how
you
ever
goin
to
help

shore
you
might
hold
dale
back
if
you
love
him
an
swear
you
wo
give
yourself

him
an
i
reckon
i
respect
your
religion
if

goin
to
suffer
through

but
not

nor
you
nor
bo
nor

or

or

thet
cowboy
las
vegas
oh
if
dale
brings
bo
back
to
me
what
will
i
care
for
my
ranch
murmured
helen
reckon
you
only
begin
to
care
when
thet
happens
your
big
hunter
has
got
to
be
put
to
work
replied
roy
with
his
keen
smile
before
noon
that
day
the
baggage
helen
had
packed
at
home
was
left
on
the
porch
of
widow
cass
cottage
and
helen
anxious
need
of
the
hour
was
satisfied
she
was
made
comfortable
in
the
old
woman
one
spare
room
and
she
set
herself
the
task
of
fortitude
and
endurance
to
her
surprise
many
of
cass
neighbors
came
unobtrusively
to
the
back
door
of
the
little
cottage
and
made
sympathetic
inquiries
they
appeared
a
subdued
and
apprehensive
group
and
whispered
to
one
another
as
they
left
helen
gathered
from
their
visits
a
conviction
that
the
wives
of
the
men
dominated
by
beasley
believed
no
good
could
come
of
this
taking
over
of
the
ranch
indeed
helen
found
at
the
end
of
the
day
that
a
strength
had
been
borne
of
her
misfortune
the
next
day
roy
informed
her
that
his
brother
john
had
come
down
the
preceding
night
with
the
news
of
beasley
descent
upon
the
ranch
not
a
shot
had
been
fired
and
the
only
damage
done
was
that
of
the
burning
of
a
barn
this
had
been
set
on
fire
to
attract
helen
men
to
one
spot
where
beasley
had
ridden
down
upon
them
with
three
times
their
number
he
had
boldly
ordered
them
off
the
land
unless
they
wanted
to
acknowledge
him
boss
and
remain
there
in
his
service
the
three
beemans
had
stayed
having
planned
that
just
in
this
event
they
might
be
valuable
to
helen
interests
beasley
had
ridden
down
into
pine
the
same
as
upon
any
other
day
roy
reported
also
news
which
had
come
in
that
morning
how
beasley
crowd
had
celebrated
late
the
night
before
the
second
and
third
and
fourth
days
endlessly
wore
away
and
helen
believed
they
had
made
her
old
at
night
she
lay
awake
most
of
the
time
thinking
and
praying
but
during
the
afternoon
she
got
some
sleep
she
could
think
of
nothing
and
talk
of
nothing
except
her
sister
and
chances
of
saving
her
well
shore
you
pay
dale
a
pore
compliment
finally
protested
the
patient
roy
i
tell
you
milt
dale
can
do
anythin
he
wants
to
do
in
the
woods
you
can
believe
thet
but
i
reckon
he
run
chances
after
he
comes
this
significant
speech
thrilled
helen
with
its
assurance
of
hope
and
made
her
blood
curdle
at
the
implied
peril
awaiting
the
hunter
on
the
afternoon
of
the
fifth
day
helen
was
abruptly
awakened
from
her
nap
the
sun
had
almost
set
she
heard
voices
the
shrill
cackling
notes
of
old
cass
high
in
excitement
a
deep
voice
that
made
helen
tingle
all
over
a
girl
laugh
broken
but
happy
there
were
footsteps
and
stamping
of
hoofs
dale
had
brought
bo
back
helen
knew
it
she
grew
very
weak
and
had
to
force
herself
to
stand
erect
her
heart
began
to
pound
in
her
very
ears
a
sweet
and
perfect
joy
suddenly
flooded
her
soul
she
thanked
god
her
prayers
had
been
answered
then
suddenly
alive
with
sheer
mad
physical
gladness
she
rushed
out
she
was
just
in
time
to
see
roy
beeman
stalk
out
as
if
he
had
never
been
shot
and
with
a
yell
greet
a
big
man
dale
howdy
roy
glad
to
see
you
up
said
dale
how
the
quiet
voice
steadied
helen
she
beheld
bo
bo
looking
the
same
except
a
little
pale
and
disheveled
then
bo
saw
her
and
leaped
at
her
into
her
arms
nell
i
here
safe
all
right
never
was
so
happy
in
my
life
talk
about
your
adventures
nell
you
dear
old
mother
to
me
had
forever
bo
was
wild
with
joy
and
by
turns
she
laughed
and
cried
but
helen
could
not
voice
her
feelings
her
eyes
were
so
dim
that
she
could
scarcely
see
dale
when
he
loomed
over
her
as
she
held
bo
but
he
found
the
hand
she
put
shakily
out
nell
reckon
it
been
harder
on
his
voice
was
earnest
and
halting
she
felt
his
searching
gaze
upon
her
face
mrs
cass
said

said
as
dale
turned
toward
the
dusty
and
weary
ranger
where

grim
laugh

land

nell
why

asked
bo
suspiciously
for
answer
helen
led
her
sister
into
the
spare
room
and
closed
the
door
bo
saw
the
baggage
her
expression
changed
the
old
blaze
leaped
to
the
telltale
eyes
he
done
it
she
cried
hotly
dearest
thank

got

murmured
helen
finding
her
voice
nothing

i
prayed
only

bo
and
she
kissed
and
embraced

put

the
ranch

rather
replied
helen
and
in
a
few
trembling
words
she
told
the
story
of
her
eviction
bo
uttered
a
wild
word
that
had
more
force
than
elegance
but
it
became
her
passionate
resentment
of
this
outrage
done
her
sister
oh
does
tom
carmichael
know
this
she
added
breathlessly
how
could
he
when
he
finds
out
then
oh

glad

got
here
first
nell
my

oh
for
some
soap
and
hot
water
and
some
clean
clothes
nell
old
girl
i
was
raised
right
for
these
western
deals
too
luxurious
and
then
helen
had
her
ears
filled
with
a
account
of
running
horses
and
riggs
and
outlaws
and
beasley
called
boldly
to
his
teeth
and
a
long
ride
and
an
outlaw
who
was
a
hero
a
fight
with
riggs
blood
and
death
another
long
ride
a
wild

in

if
black
night
and
dale
and
horse
and
rides
and
starved
and
oh
nell
he
was
from
texas
helen
gathered
that
wonderful
and
dreadful
events
had
hung
over
the
bright
head
of
this
beloved
little
sister
but
the
bewilderment
occasioned
by
bo
fluent
and
remarkable
utterance
left
only
that
last
sentence
clear
presently
helen
got
a
word
in
to
inform
bo
that
cass
had
knocked
twice
for
supper
and
that
welcome
news
checked
bo
flow
of
speech
when
nothing
else
seemed
adequate
it
was
obvious
to
helen
that
roy
and
dale
had
exchanged
stories
roy
celebrated
this
reunion
by
sitting
at
table
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
shot
and
despite
helen
misfortune
and
the
suspended
waiting
balance
in
the
air
the
occasion
was
joyous
old
cass
was
in
the
height
of
her
glory
she
sensed
a
romance
here
and
true
to
her
sex
she
radiated
to
it
daylight
was
still
lingering
when
roy
got
up
and
went
out
on
the
porch
his
keen
ears
had
heard
something
helen
fancied
she
herself
had
heard
rapid
dale
come
out
called
roy
sharply
the
hunter
moved
with
his
swift
noiseless
agility
helen
and
bo
followed
halting
in
the
door
thet
las
vegas
whispered
dale
to
helen
it
seemed
that
the
cowboy
name
changed
the
very
atmosphere
voices
were
heard
at
the
gate
one
that
harsh
and
quick
sounded
like
carmichael
and
a
spirited
horse
was
pounding
and
scattering
gravel
then
a
lithe
figure
appeared
striding
up
the
path
it
was
carmichael
yet
not
the
carmichael
helen
knew
she
heard
bo
strange
little
cry
a
corroboration
of
her
own
impression
roy
might
never
have
been
shot
judging
from
the
way
he
stepped
out
and
dale
was
almost
as
quick
carmichael
reached
them
grasped
them
with
swift
hard
hands
boys
i
jest
rode
in
an
they
said
you
found
her
shore
las
vegas
dale
fetched
her
home
safe
an
sound
there
she
the
cowboy
thrust
aside
the
two
men
and
with
a
long
stride
he
faced
the
porch
his
piercing
eyes
on
the
door
all
that
helen
could
think
of
his
look
was
that
it
seemed
terrible
bo
stepped
outside
in
front
of
helen
probably
she
would
have
run
straight
into
carmichael
arms
if
some
strange
instinct
had
not
withheld
her
helen
judged
it
to
be
fear
she
found
her
heart
lifting
painfully
bo
he
yelled
like
a
savage
yet
he
did
not
in
the
least
resemble
one
oh
tom
cried
bo
falteringly
she
half
held
out
her
arms
you
girl
that
seemed
to
be
his
piercing
query
like
the
quivering
blade
in
his
eyes
two
more
long
strides
carried
him
close
up
to
her
and
his
look
chased
the
red
out
of
bo
cheek
then
it
was
beautiful
to
see
his
face
marvelously
change
until
it
was
that
of
the
well
remembered
las
vegas
magnified
in
all
his
old
spirit
aw
the
exclamation
was
a
tremendous
sigh
i
shore
am
glad
that
beautiful
flash
left
his
face
as
he
wheeled
to
the
men
he
wrung
dale
hand
long
and
hard
and
his
gaze
confused
the
older
man
riggs
he
said
and
in
the
jerk
of
his
frame
as
he
whipped
out
the
word
disappeared
the
strange
fleeting
signs
of
his
kindlier
emotion
wilson
killed
him
replied
dale
jim
wilson
that
old
texas
ranger
reckon
he
lent
you
a
hand
my
friend
he
saved
bo
replied
dale
with
emotion
my
old
cougar
me
we
just
hung
you
made
wilson
help
you
cut
in
the
hard
voice
yes
but
he
killed
riggs
before
i
come
up
an
i
reckon
he
done
well
by
bo
if
i
never
got
how
about
the
gang
all
snuffed
out
i
reckon
except
somebody
told
me
beasley
hed
ran
miss
helen
off
the
ranch
thet
so
yes
four
of
his
greasers
packed
her
down
the
hill

tore
her
clothes
off
so
roy
tells
four
greasers
shore
it
was
beasley
deal
clean
through
yes
riggs
was
led
he
had
an
itch
for
a
bad
name
you
know
but
beasley
made
the
plan
it
was
nell
they
wanted
instead
of
abruptly
carmichael
stalked
off
down
the
darkening
path
his
silver
ringing
his
spurs
jingling
hold
on
carmichael
called
dale
taking
a
step
oh
tom
cried
bo
shore
folks
callin
wo
be
no
use
if
anythin
would
be
said
roy
las
vegas
has
hed
a
look
at
red
he
been
drinking
oh
that
accounts
he
never
never
even
touched
me
for
once
helen
was
not
ready
to
comfort
bo
a
mighty
tug
at
her
heart
had
sent
her
with
flying
uneven
steps
toward
dale
he
took
another
stride
down
the
path
and
another
dale
oh
please
stop
she
called
very
low
he
halted
as
if
he
had
run
sharply
into
a
bar
across
the
path
when
he
turned
helen
had
come
close
twilight
was
deep
there
in
the
shade
of
the
but
she
could
see
his
face
the
hungry
flaring
eyes
i
i
have
thanked
you
yet
for
bringing
bo
home
she
whispered
nell
never
mind
that
he
said
in
surprise
if
you
must
why
wait
i
got
to
catch
up
with
that
no
let
me
thank
you
now
she
whispered
and
stepping
closer
she
put
her
arms
up
meaning
to
put
them
round
his
neck
that
action
must
be
her
for
the
other
time
she
had
done
it
yet
it
might
also
serve
to
thank
him
but
strangely
her
hands
got
no
farther
than
his
breast
and
fluttered
there
to
catch
hold
of
the
fringe
of
his
buckskin
jacket
she
felt
a
heave
of
his
deep
chest
i
i
do
thank
you
with
all
my
heart
she
said
softly
i
owe
you
now
for
myself
and
her
more
than
i
can
ever
nell
i
your
friend
he
replied
hurriedly
do
talk
of
me
let
me
go
now
after
las
what
for
she
queried
suddenly
i
mean
to
line
up
beside
him
at
the
bar
or
wherever
he
goes
returned
dale
do
tell
me
that

straight
to
meet
nell
if
you
hold
me
up
any
longer
i
reckon
i
have
to
run
or
never
get
to
beasley
before
that
helen
locked
her
fingers
in
the
fringe
of
his
jacket
leaned
closer
to
him
all
her
being
responsive
to
a
bursting
gust
of
blood
over
her
i
not
let
you
go
she
said
he
laughed
and
put
his
great
hands
over
hers
what
you
sayin
girl
you
ca
stop
yes
i
can
dale
i
do
want
you
to
risk
your
he
stared
at
her
and
made
as
if
to
tear
her
hands
from
their
hold
listen
please
oh
please
she
implored
if
you
go
deliberately
to
kill
beasley
and
do
it
that
will
be
murder
it
against
my
religion
i
would
be
unhappy
all
my
but
child
you
be
ruined
all
your
life
if
beasley
is
not
dealt
with
as
men
of
his
breed
are
always
dealt
with
in
the
west
he
remonstrated
and
in
one
quick
move
he
had
freed
himself
from
her
clutching
fingers
helen
with
a
move
as
swift
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
clasped
her
hands
tight
milt
i
finding
myself
she
said
the
other
day
when
i
did
this
you
made
an
excuse
for
me
i
not
she
meant
to
keep
him
from
killing
beasley
if
she
sacrificed
every
last
shred
of
her
pride
and
she
stamped
the
look
of
his
face
on
her
heart
of
hearts
to
treasure
always
the
thrill
the
beat
of
her
pulses
almost
obstructed
her
thought
of
purpose
nell
just
now
when
you
overcome
rash
with
feelin
do
say
to
me
a
word
a
he
broke
down
huskily
my
first
friend
my
oh
dale
i
know
you
love
me
she
whispered
and
she
hid
her
face
on
his
breast
there
to
feel
a
tremendous
tumult
oh
do
you
she
cried
in
low
smothered
voice
as
his
silence
drove
her
farther
on
this
mad
yet
glorious
purpose
if
you
need
to
be
told
yes
i
reckon
i
do
love
you
nell
rayner
he
replied
it
seemed
to
helen
that
he
spoke
from
far
off
she
lifted
her
face
her
heart
on
her
lips
if
you
kill
beasley
i
never
marry
you
she
said
who
expectin
you
to
he
asked
with
low
hoarse
laugh
do
you
think
you
have
to
marry
me
to
square
accounts
this
the
only
time
you
ever
hurt
me
nell
rayner
i
you
could
think
i
expect
you
out
of
gratitude
oh
you
you
are
as
dense
as
the
forest
where
you
live
she
cried
and
then
she
shut
her
eyes
again
the
better
to
remember
that
transfiguration
of
his
face
the
better
to
betray
herself
man
i
love
you
full
and
deep
yet
tremulous
the
words
burst
from
her
heart
that
had
been
burdened
with
them
for
many
a
day
then
it
seemed
in
the
throbbing
riot
of
her
senses
that
she
was
lifted
and
swung
into
his
arms
and
handled
with
a
great
and
terrible
tenderness
and
hugged
and
kissed
with
the
hunger
and
awkwardness
of
a
bear
and
held
with
her
feet
off
the
ground
and
rendered
blind
dizzy
rapturous
and
frightened
and
utterly
torn
asunder
from
her
old
calm
thinking
self
he
put
her
down
released
her
nothin
could
have
made
me
so
happy
as
what
you
he
finished
with
a
strong
sigh
of
unutterable
wondering
joy
then
you
will
not
go
to
to
meet
helen
happy
query
froze
on
her
lips
i
got
to
go
he
rejoined
with
his
old
quiet
voice
hurry
in
to
bo
an
do
worry
try
to
think
of
things
as
i
taught
you
up
in
the
helen
heard
his
soft
padded
footfalls
swiftly
pass
away
she
was
left
there
alone
in
the
darkening
twilight
suddenly
cold
and
stricken
as
if
turned
to
stone
thus
she
stood
an
moment
until
the
upflashing
truth
galvanized
her
into
action
then
she
flew
in
pursuit
of
dale
the
truth
was
that
in
spite
of
dale
early
training
in
the
east
and
the
long
years
of
solitude
which
had
made
him
wonderful
in
thought
and
feeling
he
had
also
become
a
part
of
this
raw
bold
and
violent
west
it
was
quite
dark
now
and
she
had
run
quite
some
distance
before
she
saw
dale
tall
dark
form
against
the
yellow
light
of
turner
saloon
somehow
in
that
poignant
moment
when
her
flying
feet
kept
pace
with
her
heart
helen
felt
in
herself
a
force
opposing
itself
against
this
raw
primitive
justice
of
the
west
she
was
one
of
the
first
influences
emanating
from
civilized
life
from
law
and
order
in
that
flash
of
truth
she
saw
the
west
as
it
would
be
some
future
time
when
through
women
and
children
these
wild
frontier
days
would
be
gone
forever
also
just
as
clearly
she
saw
the
present
need
of
men
like
roy
beeman
and
dale
and
the
carmichael
beasley
and
his
kind
must
be
killed
but
helen
did
not
want
her
lover
her
future
husband
and
the
probable
father
of
her
children
to
commit
what
she
held
to
be
murder
at
the
door
of
the
saloon
she
caught
up
with
dale
milt
oh
wait
wait
she
panted
she
heard
him
curse
under
his
breath
as
he
turned
they
were
alone
in
the
yellow
flare
of
light
horses
were
champing
bits
and
drooping
before
the
rails
you
go
back
ordered
dale
sternly
his
face
was
pale
his
eyes
were
gleaming
no
not
till
you
take
me
or
carry
me
she
replied
resolutely
with
all
a
woman
positive
and
inevitable
assurance
then
he
laid
hold
of
her
with
ungentle
hands
his
violence
especially
the
look
on
his
face
terrified
helen
rendered
her
weak
but
nothing
could
have
shaken
her
resolve
she
felt
victory
her
sex
her
love
and
her
presence
would
be
too
much
for
dale
as
he
swung
helen
around
the
low
hum
of
voices
inside
the
saloon
suddenly
rose
to
sharp
hoarse
roars
accompanied
by
a
scuffling
of
feet
and
crashing
of
violently
sliding
chairs
or
tables
dale
let
go
of
helen
and
leaped
toward
the
door
but
a
silence
inside
quicker
and
stranger
than
the
roar
halted
him
helen
heart
contracted
then
seemed
to
cease
beating
there
was
absolutely
not
a
perceptible
sound
even
the
horses
appeared
like
dale
to
have
turned
to
statues
two
thundering
shots
annihilated
this
silence
then
quickly
came
a
lighter
shot
the
smash
of
glass
dale
ran
into
the
saloon
the
horses
began
to
snort
to
rear
to
pound
a
low
muffled
murmur
terrified
helen
even
as
it
drew
her
dashing
at
the
door
she
swung
it
in
and
entered
the
place
was
dim
smelling
of
smoke
dale
stood
just
inside
the
door
on
the
floor
lay
two
men
chairs
and
tables
were
overturned
a
motley
dark
booted
and
belted
crowd
of
men
appeared
hunched
against
the
opposite
wall
with
pale
set
faces
turned
to
the
bar
turner
the
proprietor
stood
at
one
end
his
face
livid
his
hands
aloft
and
shaking
carmichael
leaned
against
the
middle
of
the
bar
he
held
a
gun
low
down
it
was
smoking
with
a
gasp
helen
flashed
her
eyes
back
to
dale
he
had
seen
her
was
reaching
an
arm
toward
her
then
she
saw
the
man
lying
almost
at
her
feet
jeff
mulvey
her
uncle
old
foreman
his
face
was
awful
to
behold
a
smoking
gun
lay
near
his
inert
hand
the
other
man
had
fallen
on
his
face
his
garb
proclaimed
him
a
mexican
he
was
not
yet
dead
then
helen
as
she
felt
dale
arm
encircle
her
looked
farther
because
she
could
not
prevent
it
looked
on
at
that
strange
figure
against
the
bar
this
boy
who
had
been
such
a
friend
in
her
hour
of
need
this
naive
and
frank
sweetheart
of
her
sister
she
saw
a
man
now
wild
white
intense
as
fire
with
some
terrible
cool
kind
of
deadliness
in
his
mien
his
left
elbow
rested
upon
the
bar
and
his
hand
held
a
glass
of
red
liquor
the
big
gun
low
down
in
his
other
hand
seemed
as
steady
as
if
it
were
a
fixture
heah
to
thet
beasley
an
his
outfit
carmichael
drank
while
his
flaming
eyes
held
the
crowd
then
with
savage
action
of
terrible
passion
he
flung
the
glass
at
the
quivering
form
of
the
still
living
mexican
on
the
floor
helen
felt
herself
slipping
all
seemed
to
darken
around
her
she
could
not
see
dale
though
she
knew
he
held
her
then
she
fainted
chapter
xxv
las
vegas
carmichael
was
a
product
of
his
day
the
pan
handle
of
texas
the
old
chisholm
trail
along
which
were
driven
the
great
cattle
herds
northward
fort
dodge
where
the
cowboys
conflicted
with
the
these
hard
places
had
left
their
marks
on
carmichael
to
come
from
texas
was
to
come
from
fighting
stock
and
a
cowboy
life
was
strenuous
wild
violent
and
generally
brief
the
exceptions
were
the
fortunate
and
the
swiftest
men
with
guns
and
they
drifted
from
south
to
north
and
west
taking
with
them
the
reckless
chivalrous
vitriolic
spirit
peculiar
to
their
breed
the
pioneers
and
ranchers
of
the
frontier
would
never
have
made
the
west
habitable
had
it
not
been
for
these
wild
cowboys
these
rangers
of
the
barrens
these
easy
cool
laconic
simple
young
men
whose
blood
was
tinged
with
fire
and
who
possessed
a
magnificent
and
terrible
effrontery
toward
danger
and
death
las
vegas
ran
his
horse
from
widow
cass
cottage
to
turner
saloon
and
the
hoofs
of
the
goaded
steed
crashed
in
the
door
las
entrance
was
a
leap
then
he
stood
still
with
the
door
ajar
and
the
horse
pounding
and
snorting
back
all
the
men
in
that
saloon
who
saw
the
entrance
of
las
vegas
knew
what
it
portended
no
thunderbolt
could
have
more
quickly
checked
the
drinking
gambling
talking
crowd
they
recognized
with
kindred
senses
the
nature
of
the
man
and
his
arrival
for
a
second
the
room
was
perfectly
quiet
then
men
breathed
moved
rose
and
suddenly
caused
a
quick
sliding
crash
of
chairs
and
tables
the
cowboy
glittering
eyes
flashed
to
and
fro
and
then
fixed
on
mulvey
and
his
mexican
companion
that
glance
singled
out
these
two
and
the
sudden
rush
of
nervous
men
proved
it
mulvey
and
the
were
left
alone
in
the
center
of
the
floor
howdy
jeff
where
your
boss
asked
las
vegas
his
voice
was
cool
friendly
his
manner
was
easy
natural
but
the
look
of
him
was
what
made
mulvey
pale
and
the
mexican
livid
reckon
he
home
replied
mulvey
home
what
he
call
home
now
he
hangin
out
hyar
at
auchincloss
replied
mulvey
his
voice
was
not
strong
but
his
eyes
were
steady
watchful
las
vegas
quivered
all
over
as
if
stung
a
flame
that
seemed
white
and
red
gave
his
face
a
singular
hue
jeff
you
worked
for
old
al
a
long
time
an
i
heard
of
your
differences
said
las
vegas
thet
ai
no
mix
of
mine
but
you
miss
helen
mulvey
made
no
attempt
to
deny
this
he
gulped
slowly
his
hands
appeared
less
steady
and
he
grew
paler
again
las
vegas
words
signified
less
than
his
look
and
that
look
now
included
the
mexican
pedro
you
one
of
beasley
old
hands
said
las
vegas
accusingly
an
you
was
one
of
them
four
greasers
thet
here
the
cowboy
choked
and
bit
over
his
words
as
if
they
were
a
material
poison
the
mexican
showed
his
guilt
and
cowardice
he
began
to
jabber
shet
up
hissed
las
vegas
with
a
savage
and
significant
jerk
of
his
arm
as
if
about
to
strike
but
that
action
was
read
for
its
true
meaning
the
crowd
split
to
rush
each
way
and
leave
an
open
space
behind
the
three
las
vegas
waited
but
mulvey
seemed
obstructed
the
mexican
looked
dangerous
through
his
fear
his
fingers
twitched
as
if
the
tendons
running
up
into
his
arms
were
being
pulled
an
instant
of
suspense
more
than
long
enough
for
mulvey
to
be
tried
and
found
wanting
and
las
vegas
with
laugh
and
sneer
turned
his
back
upon
the
pair
and
stepped
to
the
bar
his
call
for
a
bottle
made
turner
jump
and
hold
it
out
with
shaking
hands
las
vegas
poured
out
a
drink
while
his
gaze
was
intent
on
the
scarred
old
mirror
hanging
behind
the
bar
this
turning
his
back
upon
men
he
had
just
dared
to
draw
showed
what
kind
of
a
school
las
vegas
had
been
trained
in
if
those
men
had
been
worthy
antagonists
of
his
class
he
would
never
have
scorned
them
as
it
was
when
mulvey
and
the
mexican
jerked
at
their
guns
las
vegas
swiftly
wheeled
and
shot
twice
mulvey
gun
went
off
as
he
fell
and
the
mexican
doubled
up
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
then
las
vegas
reached
around
with
his
left
hand
for
the
drink
he
had
poured
out
at
this
juncture
dale
burst
into
the
saloon
suddenly
to
check
his
impetus
to
swerve
aside
toward
the
bar
and
halt
the
door
had
not
ceased
swinging
when
again
it
was
propelled
inward
this
time
to
admit
helen
rayner
white
and
in
another
moment
then
las
vegas
had
spoken
his
deadly
toast
to
beasley
gang
and
had
fiercely
flung
the
glass
at
the
writhing
mexican
on
the
floor
also
dale
had
gravitated
toward
the
reeling
helen
to
catch
her
when
she
fainted
las
vegas
began
to
curse
and
striding
to
dale
he
pushed
him
out
of
the
saloon
what
you
doin
heah
he
yelled
stridently
hev
you
got
thet

think
of

heah
riskin
herself
thet
way

care
of

an
bo
leave
this
deal
to
me
the
cowboy
furious
as
he
was
at
dale
yet
had
keen
swift
eyes
for
the
horses
near
at
hand
and
the
men
out
in
the
dim
light
dale
lifted
the
girl
into
his
arms
and
turning
without
a
word
stalked
away
to
disappear
in
the
darkness
las
vegas
holding
his
gun
low
returned
to
the
if
there
had
been
any
change
in
the
crowd
it
was
slight
the
tension
had
relaxed
turner
no
longer
stood
with
hands
up
go
on
with
your
fun
called
the
cowboy
with
a
sweep
of
his
gun
but
it
be
risky
fer
any
one
to
start
with
that
he
backed
against
the
bar
near
where
the
black
bottle
stood
turner
walked
out
to
begin
righting
tables
and
chairs
and
presently
the
crowd
with
some
caution
and
suspense
resumed
their
games
and
drinking
it
was
significant
that
a
wide
berth
lay
between
them
and
the
door
from
time
to
time
turner
served
liquor
to
men
who
called
for
it
las
vegas
leaned
with
back
against
the
bar
after
a
while
he
sheathed
his
gun
and
reached
around
for
the
bottle
he
drank
with
his
piercing
eyes
upon
the
door
no
one
entered
and
no
one
went
out
the
games
of
chance
there
and
the
drinking
were
not
enjoyed
it
was
a
hard
scene
that
smoky
long
room
with
its
dim
yellow
lights
and
dark
evil
faces
with
the
turner
passing
to
and
fro
and
the
dead
mulvey
staring
in
horrible
fixidity
at
the
ceiling
and
the
mexican
quivering
more
and
more
until
he
shook
violently
then
lay
still
and
with
the
drinking
somber
waiting
cowboy
more
fiery
and
more
flaming
with
every
drink
listening
for
a
step
that
did
not
come
time
passed
and
what
little
change
it
wrought
was
in
the
cowboy
drink
affected
him
but
he
did
not
become
drunk
it
seemed
that
the
liquor
he
drank
was
consumed
by
a
mounting
fire
it
was
fuel
to
a
driving
passion
he
grew
more
sullen
somber
brooding
redder
of
eye
and
face
more
crouching
and
restless
at
last
when
the
hour
was
so
late
that
there
was
no
probability
of
beasley
appearing
las
vegas
flung
himself
out
of
the
saloon
all
lights
of
the
village
had
now
been
extinguished
the
tired
horses
drooped
in
the
darkness
las
vegas
found
his
horse
and
led
him
away
down
the
road
and
out
a
lane
to
a
field
where
a
barn
stood
dim
and
dark
in
the
starlight
morning
was
not
far
off
he
unsaddled
the
horse
and
turning
him
loose
went
into
the
barn
here
he
seemed
familiar
with
his
surroundings
for
he
found
a
ladder
and
climbed
to
a
loft
where
he
threw
himself
on
the
hay
he
rested
but
did
not
sleep
at
daylight
he
went
down
and
brought
his
horse
into
the
barn
sunrise
found
las
vegas
pacing
to
and
fro
the
short
length
of
the
interior
and
peering
out
through
wide
cracks
between
the
boards
then
during
the
succeeding
couple
of
hours
he
watched
the
occasional
horseman
and
wagon
and
herder
that
passed
on
into
the
village
about
the
breakfast
hour
las
vegas
saddled
his
horse
and
rode
back
the
way
he
had
come
the
night
before
at
turner
he
called
for
something
to
eat
as
well
as
for
whisky
after
that
he
became
a
listening
watching
machine
he
drank
freely
for
an
hour
then
he
stopped
he
seemed
to
be
drunk
but
with
a
different
kind
of
drunkenness
from
that
usual
in
drinking
men
savage
fierce
sullen
he
was
one
to
avoid
turner
waited
on
him
in
evident
fear
at
length
las
vegas
condition
became
such
that
action
was
involuntary
he
could
not
stand
still
nor
sit
down
stalking
out
he
passed
the
store
where
men
slouched
back
to
avoid
him
and
he
went
down
the
road
wary
and
alert
as
if
he
expected
a
from
some
hidden
enemy
upon
his
return
down
that
main
thoroughfare
of
the
village
not
a
person
was
to
be
seen
he
went
in
to
turner
the
proprietor
was
there
at
his
post
nervous
and
pale
las
vegas
did
not
order
any
more
liquor
turner
i
reckon
i
bore
you
next
time
i
run
in
heah
he
said
and
stalked
out
he
had
the
stores
the
road
the
village
to
himself
and
he
patrolled
a
beat
like
a
sentry
watching
for
an
indian
attack
toward
noon
a
single
man
ventured
out
into
the
road
to
accost
the
cowboy
las
vegas
i
tellin
you
all
the
greasers
air
leavin
the
range
he
said
howdy

las

las
vegas
spat
out
frightful
curses
abe

where
the
west
spoke
beasley
would
be
forced
to
meet
the
enemy
who
had
come
out
against
him
long
before
this
hour
a
braver
man
would
have
come
to
face
las
vegas
beasley
could
not
hire
any
gang
to
bear
the
brunt
of
this
situation
this
was
the
test
by
which
even
his
own
men
must
judge
him
all
of
which
was
to
say
that
as
the
wildness
of
the
west
had
made
possible
his
crimes
so
it
now
held
him
responsible
for
them
abe
if
thet
greaser
do
rustle
down
heah
i
goin
after
sure
but
do
be
in
no
hurry
replied
abe
i
waltzin
to
slow
music
gim
me
a
with
fingers
that
slightly
trembled
abe
rolled
a
cigarette
lit
it
from
his
own
and
handed
it
to
the
cowboy
las
vegas
i
reckon
i
hear
hosses
he
said
suddenly
me
too
replied
las
vegas
with
his
head
high
like
that
of
a
listening
deer
apparently
he
forgot
the
cigarette
and
also
his
friend
abe
hurried
back
to
the
store
where
he
disappeared
las
vegas
began
his
stalking
up
and
down
and
his
action
now
was
an
exaggeration
of
all
his
former
movements
a
rational
ordinary
mortal
from
some
eastern
community
happening
to
meet
this
cowboy
would
have
considered
him
drunk
or
crazy
probably
las
vegas
looked
both
but
all
the
same
he
was
a
marvelously
keen
and
strung
and
efficient
instrument
to
meet
the
portending
issue
how
many
thousands
of
times
on
the
trails
and
in
the
little
towns
all
over
the
west
had
this
stalk
of
the
cowboy
been
perpetrated
violent
bloody
tragic
as
it
was
it
had
an
importance
in
that
pioneer
day
equal
to
the
use
of
a
horse
or
the
need
of
a
plow
at
length
pine
was
apparently
a
deserted
village
except
for
las
vegas
who
patrolled
his
long
beat
in
many
ways
he
lounged
while
he
watched
he
stalked
like
a
mountaineer
he
stole
along
indian
fashion
stealthily
from
tree
to
tree
from
corner
to
corner
he
disappeared
in
the
saloon
to
reappear
at
the
back
he
slipped
round
behind
the
barns
to
come
out
again
in
the
main
road
and
time
after
time
he
approached
his
horse
as
if
deciding
to
mount
the
last
visit
he
made
into
turner
saloon
he
found
no
one
there
savagely
he
pounded
on
the
bar
with
his
gun
he
got
no
response
then
the
rage
burst
with
wild
whoops
he
pulled
another
gun
and
shot
at
the
mirror
the
lamps
he
shot
the
neck
off
a
bottle
and
drank
till
he
choked
his
neck
corded
bulging
and
purple
his
only
slow
and
deliberate
action
was
the
reloading
of
his
gun
then
he
crashed
through
the
doors
and
with
a
wild
yell
leaped
sheer
into
the
saddle
hauling
his
horse
up
high
and
goading
him
to
plunge
away
men
running
to
the
door
and
windows
of
the
store
saw
a
streak
of
dust
flying
down
the
road
and
then
they
trooped
out
to
see
it
disappear
the
hour
of
suspense
ended
for
them
las
vegas
had
lived
up
to
the
code
of
the
west
had
dared
his
man
out
had
waited
far
longer
than
needful
to
prove
that
man
a
coward
whatever
the
issue
now
beasley
was
branded
forever
that
moment
saw
the
decline
of
whatever
power
he
had
wielded
he
and
his
men
might
kill
the
cowboy
who
had
ridden
out
alone
to
face
him
but
that
would
not
change
the
brand
the
preceding
night
beasley
bad
been
finishing
a
late
supper
at
his
newly
acquired
ranch
when
buck
weaver
one
of
his
men
burst
in
upon
him
with
news
of
the
death
of
mulvey
and
pedro
who
in
the
outfit
how
many
he
had
questioned
quickly
it
a
outfit
boss
replied
weaver
beasley
appeared
astounded
he
and
his
men
had
prepared
to
meet
the
friends
of
the
girl
whose
property
he
had
taken
over
and
because
of
the
superiority
of
his
own
force
he
had
anticipated
no
bloody
or
extended
feud
this
amazing
circumstance
put
the
case
in
very
much
more
difficult
form
one
man
he
ejaculated
yep
thet
cowboy
las
vegas
an
boss
he
turns
out
to
be
a
from
texas
i
was
in

as

roared
beasley
buck
weaver
steadily
eyed
his
boss
before
he
replied
i

beasley
he

there
just
after
the
cowboy
plugged
jeff

thet
girl
she
came
runnin
in
too
an
she
keeled

cussed
him
so
hard
we
all
heerd
so
beasley
there
ai
no
fight
comin
off
as
we
figgered
beasley
thus
heard
the
west
speak
out
of
the
mouth
of
his
own
man
and
grim
sardonic
almost
scornful
indeed
were
the
words
of
buck
weaver
this
rider
had
once
worked
for
al
auchincloss
and
had
deserted
to
beasley
under
mulvey
leadership
mulvey
was
dead
and
the
situation
was
vastly
changed
beasley
gave
weaver
a
dark
lowering
glance
and
waved
him
away
from
the
door
weaver
sent
back
a
doubtful
scrutinizing
gaze
then
slouched
out
that
gaze
beasley
had
not
encountered
before
it
meant
as
weaver
cronies
meant
as
beasley
riders
and
the
people
of
the
range
and
as
the
spirit
of
the
west
meant
that
beasley
was
expected
to
march
down
into
the
village
to
face
his
single
foe
but
beasley
did
not
go
instead
he
paced
to
and
fro
the
length
of
helen
rayner
long
with
the
nervous
energy
of
a
man
who
could
not
rest
many
times
he
hesitated
and
at
others
he
made
sudden
movements
toward
the
door
only
to
halt
long
after
midnight
he
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
he
tossed
and
rolled
all
night
and
at
dawn
arose
gloomy
and
irritable
he
cursed
the
mexican
who
showed
their
displeasure
at
his
authority
and
to
his
amaze
and
rage
not
one
of
his
men
came
to
the
house
he
waited
and
waited
then
he
stalked
off
to
the
corrals
and
stables
carrying
a
rifle
with
him
the
men
were
there
in
a
group
that
dispersed
somewhat
at
his
advent
not
a
mexican
was
in
sight
beasley
ordered
the
horses
to
be
saddled
and
all
hands
to
go
down
into
the
village
with
him
that
order
was
disobeyed
beasley
stormed
and
raged
his
riders
sat
or
lounged
with
lowered
faces
an
unspoken
hostility
seemed
present
those
who
had
been
longest
with
him
were
least
distant
and
strange
but
still
they
did
not
obey
at
length
beasley
roared
for
his
mexicans
boss
we
got
ta
tell
you
thet
every
greaser
on
the
ranch
hes
sloped
gone
these
two
hours
on
the
way
to
magdalena
said
buck
weaver
of
all
these
perplexities
this
latest
was
the
most
astounding
beasley
cursed
with
his
questioning
wonder
boss
they
was
sure
scared
of
thet
cowboy
from
texas
replied
weaver
imperturbably
beasley
dark
swarthy
face
changed
its
hue
what
of
the
subtle
reflection
in
weaver
slow
speech
one
of
the
men
came
out
of
a
corral
leading
beasley
saddled
and
bridled
horse
this
fellow
dropped
the
bridle
and
sat
down
among
his
comrades
without
a
word
no
one
spoke
the
presence
of
the
horse
was
significant
with
a
snarling
muttered
curse
beasley
took
up
his
rifle
and
strode
back
to
the
in
his
rage
and
passion
he
did
not
realize
what
his
men
had
known
for
hours
that
if
he
had
stood
any
chance
at
all
for
their
respect
as
well
as
for
his
life
the
hour
was
long
past
beasley
avoided
the
open
paths
to
the
house
and
when
he
got
there
he
nervously
poured
out
a
drink
evidently
something
in
the
fiery
liquor
frightened
him
for
he
threw
the
bottle
aside
it
was
as
if
that
bottle
contained
a
courage
which
was
false
again
he
paced
the
long
growing
more
and
more
as
evidently
he
grew
familiar
with
the
singular
state
of
affairs
twice
the
pale
called
him
to
dinner
the
was
light
and
pleasant
and
the
meal
fragrant
and
steaming
was
ready
for
him
but
the
women
had
disappeared
beasley
seated
himself
spread
out
his
big
hands
on
the
table
then
a
slight
rustle
a
clink
of
spur
startled
him
he
twisted
his
head
howdy
beasley
said
las
vegas
who
had
appeared
as
if
by
magic
beasley
frame
seemed
to
swell
as
if
a
flood
had
been
loosed
in
his
veins
stood
out
on
his
pallid
face
what
you
want
he
asked
huskily
wal
now

boss
miss
helen

heah

be
nice
an
proper
fer
me
to
drop
in
an
eat
with
you
the
last
time
replied
the
cowboy
his
drawl
was
slow
and
cool
his
tone
was
friendly
and
pleasant
but
his
look
was
that
of
a
falcon
ready
to
drive
deep
its
beak
beasley
reply
was
loud
incoherent
hoarse
las
vegas
seated
himself
across
from
beasley
eat
or
not
it
shore
all
the
same
to
me
said
las
vegas
and
he
began
to
load
his
plate
with
his
left
hand
his
right
hand
rested
very
lightly
with
just
the
tips
of
his
vibrating
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
he
never
for
the
slightest
fraction
of
a
second
took
his
piercing
eyes
off
beasley

las

he
was
as
tense
as
a
strung
cord
and
his
face
possessed
a
singular
pale
radiance
his
right

began
to
quiver

chapter
xxvi
for
helen
rayner
that
brief
dark
period
of
expulsion
from
her
home
had
become
a
thing
of
the
past
almost
forgotten
two
months
had
flown
by
on
the
wings
of
love
and
work
and
the
joy
of
finding
her
place
there
in
the
west
all
her
old
men
had
been
only
too
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
come
back
to
her
and
under
dale
and
roy
beeman
a
different
and
prosperous
order
marked
the
life
of
the
ranch
helen
had
made
changes
in
the
house
by
altering
the
arrangement
of
rooms
and
adding
a
new
section
only
once
had
she
ventured
into
the
old
where
las
vegas
carmichael
had
sat
down
to
that
fatal
dinner
for
beasley
she
made
a
of
it
and
a
place
she
would
never
again
enter
helen
was
happy
almost
too
happy
she
thought
and
therefore
made
more
than
needful
of
the
several
bitter
drops
in
her
sweet
cup
of
life
carmichael
had
ridden
out
of
pine
ostensibly
on
the
trail
of
the
mexicans
who
had
executed
beasley
commands
the
last
seen
of
him
had
been
reported
from
show
down
where
he
had
appeared
and
dangerous
like
a
hound
on
a
scent
then
two
months
had
flown
by
without
a
word
dale
had
shaken
his
head
doubtfully
when
interrogated
about
the
absence
it
would
be
just
like
las
vegas
never
to
be
heard
of
again
also
it
would
be
more
like
him
to
remain
away
until
all
trace
of
his
drunken
savage
spell
had
departed
from
him
and
had
been
forgotten
by
his
friends
bo
took
his
disappearance
apparently
less
to
heart
than
helen
but
bo
grew
more
restless
wilder
and
more
wilful
than
ever
helen
thought
she
guessed
bo
secret
and
once
she
ventured
a
hint
concerning
carmichael
return
if
tom
does
come
back
pretty
soon
i
marry
milt
dale
retorted
bo
tauntingly
this
fired
helen
cheeks
with
red
but
child
she
protested
half
angry
half
grave
milt
and
i
are
sure
only
you
so
slow
there
many
a
slip
you
bo
i
tell
you
tom
will
come
back
replied
helen
earnestly
i
feel
it
there
was
something
fine
in
that
cowboy
he
understood
me
better
than
you
or
milt
either
and
he
was
perfectly
wild
in
love
with
oh
was
he
very
much
more
than
you
deserved
bo
then
occurred
one
of
bo
sweet
bewildering
unexpected
transformations
her
defiance
resentment
rebelliousness
vanished
from
a
softly
agitated
face
oh
nell
i
know
that
you
just
watch
me
if
i
ever
get
another
chance
at
him
then
maybe
he
never
drink
again
bo
be
happy
and
be
good
do
ride
off
any
more
do
tease
the
boys
it
all
come
right
in
the
bo
recovered
her
equanimity
quickly
enough
humph
you
can
afford
to
be
cheerful
you
got
a
man
who
ca
live
when
you
out
of
his
sight
he
like
a
fish
on
dry
land
and
you
why
once
you
were
an
old
pessimist
bo
was
not
to
be
consoled
or
changed
helen
could
only
sigh
and
pray
that
her
convictions
would
be
verified
the
first
day
of
july
brought
an
early
just
at
sunrise
it
roared
and
flared
and
rolled
away
leaving
a
gorgeous
golden
cloud
pageant
in
the
sky
and
a
fresh
sweetly
smelling
glistening
green
range
that
delighted
helen
eye
birds
were
twittering
in
the
arbors
and
bees
were
humming
in
the
flowers
from
the
fields
down
along
the
brook
came
a
blended
song
of
and
a
burro
split
the
air
with
his
coarse
and
homely
bray
the
sheep
were
bleating
and
a
soft
baa
of
little
lambs
came
sweetly
to
helen
ears
she
went
her
usual
rounds
with
more
than
usual
zest
and
thrill
everywhere
was
color
activity
life
the
wind
swept
warm
and
down
from
the
mountain
heights
now
black
and
bold
and
the
great
green
slopes
seemed
to
call
to
her
at
that
very
moment
she
came
suddenly
upon
dale
in
his
dusty
and
hot
standing
motionless
gazing
at
the
distant
mountains
helen
greeting
startled
him
i
i
was
just
looking
away
yonder
he
said
smiling
she
thrilled
at
the
clear
wonderful
light
of
his
eyes
so
was
i
a
moment
ago
she
replied
wistfully
do
you
miss
the
forest
very
much
nell
i
miss
nothing
but
i
like
to
ride
with
you
under
the
pines
once
we
go
she
cried
when
he
asked
eagerly
oh
soon
and
then
with
flushed
face
and
downcast
eyes
she
passed
on
for
long
helen
had
cherished
a
fond
hope
that
she
might
be
married
in
paradise
park
where
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
dale
and
had
realized
herself
but
she
had
kept
that
hope
secret
dale
eager
tone
his
flashing
eyes
had
made
her
feel
that
her
secret
was
there
in
her
telltale
face
as
she
entered
the
lane
leading
to
the
house
she
encountered
one
of
the
new
driving
a
jim
whose
pack
is
that
she
asked
i
dunno
but
i
heard
him
tell
roy
he
reckoned
his
name
was
mud
replied
the
boy
smiling
helen
heart
gave
a
quick
throb
that
sounded
like
las
vegas
she
hurried
on
and
upon
entering
the
courtyard
she
espied
roy
beeman
holding
the
halter
of
a
beautiful
mustang
there
was
another
horse
with
another
man
who
was
in
the
act
of
dismounting
on
the
far
side
when
he
stepped
into
better
view
helen
recognized
las
vegas
and
he
saw
her
at
the
same
instant
helen
did
not
look
up
again
until
she
was
near
the
porch
she
had
dreaded
this
meeting
yet
she
was
so
glad
that
she
could
have
cried
aloud
miss
helen
i
shore
am
glad
to
see
you
he
said
standing
bareheaded
before
her
the
same
young
cowboy
she
had
seen
first
from
the
train
tom
she
exclaimed
and
offered
her
hands
he
wrung
them
hard
while
he
looked
at
her
the
swift
woman
glance
helen
gave
in
return
seemed
to
drive
something
dark
and
doubtful
out
of
her
heart
this
was
the
same
boy
she
had
known
whom
she
had
liked
so
well
who
had
won
her
sister
love
helen
imagined
facing
him
thus
was
like
awakening
from
a
vague
nightmare
of
doubt
carmichael
face
was
clean
fresh
young
with
its
healthy
tan
it
wore
the
old
glad
smile
cool
easy
and
natural
his
eyes
were
like
dale
penetrating
clear
as
crystal
without
a
shadow
what
had
evil
drink
blood
to
do
with
the
real
inherent
nobility
of
this
splendid
specimen
of
western
hardihood
wherever
he
had
been
whatever
he
had
done
during
that
long
absence
he
had
returned
long
separated
from
that
wild
and
savage
character
she
could
now
forget
perhaps
there
would
never
again
be
call
for
it
how
my
girl
he
asked
just
as
naturally
as
if
he
had
been
gone
a
few
days
on
some
errand
of
his
employer
bo
oh
she
well
fine
i
i
rather
think
she
be
glad
to
see
you
replied
helen
warmly
an
how
thet
big
indian

drawled
well
too
i
reckon

heah
in
time
to
see

i
assure
you
i
no
one
around
here

replied
helen
with
a
blush
thet
shore
is
fine
was
some
worried
he
said
lazily
i
been
chasin
wild
hosses
over
in
new
mexico
an
i
got
after
this
heah
blue
roan
he
kept
me
chasin
him
fer
a
spell
i
fetched
him
back
for
helen
looked
at
the
mustang
roy
was
holding
to
be
instantly
delighted
he
was
a
roan
almost
blue
in
color
neither
large
nor
heavy
but
powerfully
built
and
racy
with
a
long
mane
and
tail
black
as
coal
and
a
beautiful
head
that
made
helen
love
him
at
once
well
i
jealous
declared
helen
archly
i
never
did
see
such
a
i
reckoned
you
never
ride
any
hoss
but
ranger
said
las
vegas
no

i
reckon
if
you
say

to
have

wal
bo
be
funny
he
drawled
i
reckon
she
would
be
funny
retorted
helen
she
was
so
happy
that
she
imitated
his
speech
she
wanted
to
hug
him
it
was
too
good
to
be
true
the
return
of
this
cowboy
he
understood
her
he
had
come
back
with
nothing
that
could
alienate
her
he
had
apparently
forgotten
the
terrible
role
he
had
accepted
and
the
doom
he
had
meted
out
to
her
enemies
that
moment
was
wonderful
for
helen
in
its
revelation
of
the
strange
significance
of
the
west
as
embodied
in
this
cowboy
he
was
great
but
he
did
not
know
that
then
the
door
of
the
opened
and
a
sweet
high
voice
pealed
out
roy
oh
what
a
mustang
whose
is
he
wal
bo
if
all
i
hear
is
so
he
belongs
to
you
replied
roy
with
a
huge
grin
bo
appeared
in
the
door
she
stepped
out
upon
the
porch
she
saw
the
cowboy
the
excited
flash
of
her
pretty
face
vanished
as
she
paled
bo
i
shore
am
glad
to
see
you
drawled
las
vegas
as
he
stepped
forward
sombrero
in
hand
helen
could
not
see
any
sign
of
confusion
in
him
but
indeed
she
saw
gladness
then
she
expected
to
behold
bo
run
right
into
the
cowboys
arms
it
appeared
however
that
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
tom
i
glad
to
see
you
she
replied
they
shook
hands
as
old
friends
you
lookin
right
fine
he
said
oh

how

been
these
six
months
she
queried

i
though
it
was
longer
he
drawled
wal
i
pretty
now
but
i
was
laid
up
with
heart
trouble
for
a
heart

she
echoed
dubiously
shore
i
ate
too
much
over
heah
in
new
it
no
news
to
me
where
your
heart
located
laughed
bo
then
she
ran
off
the
porch
to
see
the
blue
mustang
she
walked
round
and
round
him
clasping
her
hands
in
sheer
delight
bo
he
a
plumb
dandy
said
roy
never
seen
a
prettier
hoss

like
a
streak
an
he
got
good
eyes

a
pet
some
day
but
i
reckon
he
always
be
bo
ventured
to
step
closer
and
at
last
got
a
hand
on
the
mustang
and
then
another
she
smoothed
his
quivering
neck
and
called
softly
to
him
until
he
submitted
to
her
hold
what
his
name
she
asked
blue
somethin
or
other
replied
roy
tom
has
my
new
mustang
a
name
asked
bo
turning
to
the
cowboy
what
then
wal
i
named

answered
las
vegas
with
a
smile
nope

him
all

well

thanks
drawled
the
cowboy
but
see
heah
bo
you
shore
got
to
live
up
to
conditions
before
you
ride
what
exclaimed
bo
who
was
startled
by
his
slow
cool
meaning
tone
of
voice
helen
delighted
in
looking
at
las
vegas
then
he
had
never
appeared
to
better
advantage
so
cool
careless
and
assured
he
seemed
master
of
a
situation
in
which
his
terms
must
be
accepted
yet
he
might
have
been
actuated
by
a
cowboy
motive
beyond
the
power
of
helen
to
divine
bo
rayner
drawled
las
vegas
thet
blue
mustang
will
be
yours
you
can
ride
him
when
you
tom
carmichael
never
had
he
spoken
a
softer
more
drawling
speech
nor
gazed
at
bo
more
mildly
roy
seemed
thunderstruck
helen
endeavored
heroically
to
restrain
her
delicious
bursting
glee
bo
wide
eyes
stared
at
her
lover
darkened
dilated
suddenly
she
left
the
mustang
to
confront
the
cowboy
where
he
lounged
on
the
porch
steps
do
you
mean
that
she
cried
shore
bah
it
only
a
magnificent
bluff
she
retorted
you
only
in
fun
it
your
your
darned
nerve
why
bo
began
las
vegas
reproachfully
you
shore
know
i
not
the
kind
never
got
away
with
a
bluff
in
my
life
an
i
jest
in
daid
earnest
aboot
this
all
the
same
signs
were
not
wanting
in
his
mobile
face
that
he
was
almost
unable
to
restrain
his
mirth
helen
realized
then
that
bo
saw
through
the
cowboy
that
the
ultimatum
was
only
one
of
his
tricks
it
is
a
bluff
and
i
call
you
declared
bo
ringingly
las
vegas
suddenly
awoke
to
consequences
he
essayed
to
speak
but
she
was
so
wonderful
then
so
white
and
that
he
was
stricken
mute
i
ride
this
afternoon
deliberately
stated
the
girl
las
vegas
had
wit
enough
to
grasp
her
meaning
and
he
seemed
about
to
collapse
very
well
you
can
make
me
tom
carmichael
this
morning
just
before
dinner
go
get
a
preacher
to
marry
us
and
make
yourself
look
a
more
presentable
bridegroom
unless
it
was
only
a
bluff
her
imperiousness
changed
as
the
tremendous
portent
of
her
words
seemed
to
make
las
vegas
a
blank
stone
image
of
a
man
with
a
color
suffusing
her
face
she
swiftly
bent
over
him
kissed
him
and
flashed
away
into
the
house
her
laugh
pealed
back
and
it
thrilled
helen
so
deep
and
strange
was
it
for
the
wilful
sister
so
wild
and
merry
and
full
of
joy
it
was
then
that
roy
beeman
recovered
from
his
paralysis
to
let
out
such
a
roar
of
mirth
as
to
frighten
the
horses
helen
was
laughing
and
crying
too
but
laughing
mostly
las
vegas
carmichael
was
a
sight
for
the
gods
to
behold
bo
kiss
had
unclamped
what
had
bound
him
the
sudden
truth
undeniable
insupportable
glorious
made
him
a
madman

she
called

helen

rock
roy
can

happy
hope

her

said
roy
miss
helen
you
tell
bo
thet
it
all
he
picked
up
the
halter
on
the
blue
mustang
and
turned
away
toward
the
corrals
las
vegas
put
the
bridle
of
his
horse
over
his
arm
and
seemed
to
be
following
in
a
trance
with
his
dazed
rapt
face
held
high
bring
dale
called
helen
softly
after
them
so
it
came
about
as
naturally
as
it
was
wonderful
that
bo
rode
the
blue
mustang
before
the
afternoon
ended
las
vegas
disobeyed
his
first
orders
from
tom
carmichael
and
rode
out
after
her
toward
the
range
helen
seemed
impelled
to
follow
she
did
not
need
to
ask
dale
the
second
time
they
rode
swiftly
but
never
caught
up
with
bo
and
las
vegas
whose
riding
resembled
their
happiness
dale
read
helen
mind
or
else
his
own
thoughts
were
in
harmony
with
hers
for
he
always
seemed
to
speak
what
she
was
thinking
and
as
they
rode
homeward
he
asked
her
in
his
quiet
way
if
they
could
not
spare
a
few
days
to
visit
his
old
camp
and
take
bo
and
tom
oh
of
all
things
i
like
to
she
replied
yes
an
roy
too
added
dale
significantly
of
course
said
helen
lightly
as
if
she
had
not
caught
his
meaning
but
she
turned
her
eyes
away
while
her
heart
thumped
disgracefully
and
all
her
body
was
aglow
will
tom
and
bo
go
it
was
tom
who
got
me
to
ask
you
replied
dale

with
his
slow
seriousness

an
me

with
helen
gave
him
her
hand
while
they
walked
the
horses
homeward
in
the
long
sunset
shadows
in
the
fullness
of
that
happy
hour
she
had
time
for
a
grateful
wonder
at
the
keen
penetration
of
the
cowboy
carmichael
dale
had
saved
her
life
but
it
was
las
vegas
who
had
saved
her
happiness
not
many
days
later
when
again
the
afternoon
shadows
were
slanting
low
helen
rode
out
upon
the
promontory
where
the
dim
trail
zigzagged
far
above
paradise
park
roy
was
singing
as
he
drove
the
down
the
slope
bo
and
las
vegas
were
trying
to
ride
the
trail
two
abreast
so
they
could
hold
hands
dale
had
dismounted
to
stand
beside
helen
horse
as
she
gazed
down
the
shaggy
black
slopes
to
the
beautiful
wild
park
with
its
gray
meadows
and
shining
ribbons
of
brooks
it
was
july
and
there
were
no
glorious
flames
and
blazes
of
color
such
as
lingered
in
helen
memory
black
spruce
slopes
and
green
pines
and
white
streaks
of
aspens
and
lacy
waterfall
of
foam
and
dark
outcroppings
of
rock
these
colors
and
forms
greeted
her
gaze
with
all
the
old
enchantment
wildness
beauty
and
loneliness
were
there
the
same
as
ever
immutable
like
the
spirit
of
those
heights
helen
would
fain
have
lingered
longer
but
the
others
called
and
ranger
impatiently
snorted
his
sense
of
the
grass
and
water
far
below
and
she
knew
that
when
she
climbed
there
again
to
the
wide
outlook
she
would
be
another
woman
nell
come
on
said
dale
as
he
led
on
it
better
to
look
the
sun
had
just
sunk
behind
the
ragged
fringe
of
when
those
three
strong
and
efficient
men
of
the
open
had
pitched
camp
and
had
prepared
a
bountiful
supper
then
roy
beeman
took
out
the
little
worn
bible
which
helen
had
given
him
to
use
when
he
married
bo
and
as
he
opened
it
a
light
changed
his
dark
face
come
helen
an
dale
he
said
they
arose
to
stand
before
him
and
he
married
them
there
under
the
great
stately
pines
with
the
fragrant
blue
smoke
curling
upward
and
the
wind
singing
through
the
branches
while
the
waterfall
murmured
its
low
soft
dreamy
music
and
from
the
dark
slope
came
the
wild
lonely
cry
of
a
wolf
full
of
the
hunger
for
life
and
a
mate
let
us
pray
said
roy
as
he
closed
the
bible
and
knelt
with
them
there
is
only
one
god
an
him
i
beseech
in
my
humble
office
for
the
woman
an
man
i
have
just
wedded
in
holy
bonds
bless
them
an
watch
them
an
keep
them
through
all

when
the
preacher
stood
up
again
and
raised
the
couple
from
their
kneeling
posture
it
seemed
that
a
grave
and
solemn
personage
had
left
him
this
young
man
was
again
the
roy
droll
and
dry
with
the
enigmatic
smile
on
his
lips
mrs

said

action

the
only
chance

he
drawled
because
when
this
heah
big
indian
once
finds
out
what
is
las
vegas
then
proved
how
swift
and
hearty
he
could
be
upon
occasions
all
this
left
helen
red
and
confused
and
unutterably
happy
she
appreciated
dale
state
his
eyes
reflected
the
precious
treasure
which
manifestly
he
saw
but
realization
of
ownership
had
not
yet
become
demonstrable
then
with
gay
speech
and
happy
laugh
and
silent
look
these
five
partook
of
the
supper
when
it
was
finished
roy
made
known
his
intention
to
leave
they
all
protested
and
coaxed
but
to
no
avail
he
only
laughed
and
went
on
saddling
his
horse
roy

helen
the
day

helen
found

confronted
by
an
unanswerable
side
of
the
argument
las
vegas
rolled
on
the
grass
in
his
mirth
dale
looked
strange
roy
then
that
why
you

a
little
devil
in
her
eyes

bo
to

the
tables
on

roy
looked
mightily
embarrassed
and
the
laugh
was
on
him
he
did
not
face
them
again
until
he
had
mounted
las
vegas
i
done
my
best

way
to

las
vegas
bo

be
eatin
out
of
my
hand
in
about
a
bo
blue
eyes
expressed
an
eloquent
doubt
as
to
this
extraordinary
claim
friends
said
roy
and
rode
away
to
disappear
in
the
spruces
thereupon
bo
and
las
vegas
forgot
roy
and
dale
and
helen
the
camp
chores
to
be
done
and
everything
else
except
themselves
helen
first
wifely
duty
was
to
insist
that
she
should
and
could
and
would
help
her
husband
with
the
work
of
cleaning
up
after
the
sumptuous
supper
before
they
had
finished
a
sound
startled
them
it
came
from
roy
evidently
high
on
the
darkening
slope
and
was
a
long
mellow
pealing
halloo
that
rang
on
the
cool
air
burst
the
dreamy
silence
and
rapped
across
from
slope
to
slope
and
cliff
to
cliff
to
lose
its
power
and
die
away
hauntingly
in
the
distant
recesses
dale
shook
his
head
as
if
he
did
not
care
to
attempt
a
reply
to
that
beautiful
call
silence
once
again
enfolded
the
park
and
twilight
seemed
to
be
born
of
the
air
drifting
downward
nell
do
you
miss
anythin
asked
dale
no
nothing
in
all
the
world
she
murmured
i
am
happier
than
i
ever
dared
pray
to
i
do
mean
people
or
things
i
mean
my
ah
i
had
forgotten
milt
where
are
they
gone
back
to
the
wild
he
said
they
had
to
live
in
my
absence
i
been
away
just
then
the
brooding
silence
with
its
soft
murmur
of
falling
water
and
faint
sigh
of
wind
in
the
pines
was
broken
by
a
piercing
scream
high
quivering
like
that
of
a
woman
in
exquisite
agony
that
tom
exclaimed
dale
oh
i
was
so
so
frightened
whispered
helen
bo
came
running
with
las
vegas
at
her
heels
milt
that
was
your
tame
cougar
cried
bo
excitedly
oh
i
never
forget
him
i
hear
those
cries
in
my
dreams
yes
it
was
tom
said
dale
thoughtfully
but
i
never
heard
him
cry
just
like
oh
call
him
in
dale
whistled
and
called
but
tom
did
not
come
then
the
hunter
stalked
off
in
the
gloom
to
call
from
different
points
under
the
slope
after
a
while
he
returned
without
the
cougar
and
at
that
moment
from
far
up
the
dark
ravine
drifted
down
the
same
wild
cry
only
changed
by
distance
strange
and
tragic
in
its
meaning
he
scented
us
he
remembers
but
he
never
come
back
said
dale
helen
felt
stirred
anew
with
the
convictions
of
dale
deep
knowledge
of
life
and
nature
and
her
imagination
seemed
to
have
wings
how
full
and
perfect
her
trust
her
happiness
in
the
realization
that
her
love
and
her
future
her
children
and
perhaps
grandchildren
would
come
under
the
guidance
of
such
a
man
only
a
little
had
she
begun
to
comprehend
the
secrets
of
good
and
ill
in
their
relation
to
the
laws
of
nature
ages
before
men
had
lived
on
the
earth
there
had
been
the
creatures
of
the
wilderness
and
the
holes
of
the
rocks
and
the
nests
of
the
trees
and
rain
frost
heat
dew
sunlight
and
night
storm
and
calm
the
honey
of
the
wildflower
and
the
instinct
of
the
bee
all
the
beautiful
and
multiple
forms
of
life
with
their
inscrutable
design
to
know
something
of
them
and
to
love
them
was
to
be
close
to
the
kingdom
of
earth
perhaps
to
the
greater
kingdom
of
heaven
for
whatever
breathed
and
moved
was
a
part
of
that
creation
the
coo
of
the
dove
the
lichen
on
the
mossy
rock
the
mourn
of
a
hunting
wolf
and
the
murmur
of
the
waterfall
the
and
growing
tips
of
the
spruces
and
the
thunderbolts
along
the
battlements
of
the
heights
these
one
and
all
must
be
actuated
by
the
great
spirit
that
incalculable
thing
in
the
universe
which
had
produced
man
and
soul
and
there
in
the
starlight
under
the
pines
sighing
low
with
the
wind
helen
sat
with
dale
on
the
old
stone
that
an
avalanche
of
a
million
years
past
had
flung
from
the
rampart
above
to
serve
as
and
bench
for
lovers
in
the
wilderness
the
sweet
scent
of
spruce
mingled
with
the
fragrance
of
blown
in
their
faces
how
white
the
stars
and
calm
and
true
how
they
blazed
their
single
task
a
coyote
yelped
off
on
the
south
slope
dark
now
as
midnight
a
bit
of
weathered
rock
rolled
and
tapped
from
shelf
to
shelf
and
the
wind
moaned
helen
felt
all
the
sadness
and
mystery
and
nobility
of
this
lonely
fastness
and
full
on
her
heart
rested
the
supreme
consciousness
that
all
would
some
day
be
well
with
the
troubled
world
beyond
nell
i
homestead
this
park
said
dale
then
it
always
be
homestead
what
that
murmured
helen
dreamily
the
word
sounded
sweet
the
government
will
give
land
to
men
who
locate
an
build
replied
dale
we
run
up
a
log
and
come
here
often
paradise
park
whispered
helen
dale
first
kisses
were
on
her
lips
then
hard
and
cool
and
clean
like
the
life
of
the
man
singularly
exalting
to
her
completing
her
strange
and
unutterable
joy
of
the
hour
and
rendering
her
mute
bo
melodious
laugh
and
her
voice
with
its
old
mockery
of
torment
drifted
softly
on
the
night
breeze
and
the
cowboy
aw
bo
drawling
his
reproach
and
longing
was
all
that
the
tranquil
waiting
silence
needed
paradise
park
was
living
again
one
of
its
romances
love
was
no
stranger
to
that
lonely
fastness
helen
heard
in
the
whisper
of
the
wind
through
the
pine
the
story
beautiful
ever
new
and
yet
eternal
she
thrilled
to
her
depths
the
spruces
stood
up
black
and
clear
against
the
noble
stars
all
that
vast
solitude
breathed
and
waited
charged
full
with
its
secret
ready
to
reveal
itself
to
her
tremulous
soul
