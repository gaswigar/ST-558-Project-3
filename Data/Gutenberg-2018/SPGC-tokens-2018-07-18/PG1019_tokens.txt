dream
i
quench
my
lamp
i
struck
it
in
that
start
which
every
limb
convulsed
i
heard
it
fall
the
crash
blent
with
my
sleep
i
saw
depart
its
light
even
as
i
woke
on
yonder
wall
over
against
my
bed
there
shone
a
gleam
strange
faint
and
mingling
also
with
my
dream
it
sank
and
i
am
wrapt
in
utter
gloom
how
far
is
night
advanced
and
when
will
day
retinge
the
dusk
and
livid
air
with
bloom
and
fill
this
void
with
warm
creative
ray
would
i
could
sleep
again
till
clear
and
red
morning
shall
on
the
be
spread
i
call
my
women
but
to
break
their
sleep
because
my
own
is
broken
were
unjust
they
wrought
all
day
and
slumbers
steep
their
labours
in
forgetfulness
i
trust
let
me
my
feverish
watch
with
patience
bear
thankful
that
none
with
me
its
sufferings
share
yet
oh
for
light
one
ray
would
tranquillize
my
nerves
my
pulses
more
than
effort
can
i
draw
my
curtain
and
consult
the
skies
these
trembling
stars
at
dead
of
night
look
wan
wild
restless
strange
yet
can
not
be
more
drear
than
this
my
couch
shared
by
a
nameless
fear
all
black
one
great
cloud
drawn
from
east
to
west
conceals
the
heavens
but
there
are
lights
below
torches
burn
in
jerusalem
and
cast
on
yonder
stony
mount
a
lurid
glow
i
see
men
station
there
and
gleaming
spears
a
sound
too
from
afar
invades
my
ears
dull
measured
strokes
of
axe
and
hammer
ring
from
street
to
street
not
loud
but
through
the
night
distinctly
heard
and
some
strange
spectral
thing
is
now
uprear
and
fix
against
the
light
of
the
pale
lamps
defined
upon
that
sky
it
stands
up
like
a
column
straight
and
high
i
see
it
all
i
know
the
dusky
sign
a
cross
on
calvary
which
jews
uprear
while
romans
watch
and
when
the
dawn
shall
shine
pilate
to
judge
the
victim
will
appear
pass
him
up
to
crucify
and
on
that
cross
the
spotless
christ
must
die
dreams
then
are
true
for
thus
my
vision
ran
surely
some
oracle
has
been
with
me
the
gods
have
chosen
me
to
reveal
their
plan
to
warn
an
unjust
judge
of
destiny
i
slumbering
heard
and
saw
awake
i
know
christ
coming
death
and
pilate
life
of
woe
i
do
not
weep
for
pilate
who
could
prove
regret
for
him
whose
cold
and
crushing
sway
no
prayer
can
soften
no
appeal
can
move
who
tramples
hearts
as
others
trample
clay
yet
with
a
faltering
an
uncertain
tread
that
might
stir
up
reprisal
in
the
dead
forced
to
sit
by
his
side
and
see
his
deeds
forced
to
behold
that
visage
hour
by
hour
in
whose
gaunt
lines
the
abhorrent
gazer
reads
a
triple
lust
of
gold
and
blood
and
power
a
soul
whom
motives
fierce
yet
abject
urge
rome
servile
slave
and
judah
tyrant
scourge
how
can
i
love
or
mourn
or
pity
him
i
who
so
long
my
fetter
hands
have
wrung
i
who
for
grief
have
wept
my
eyesight
dim
because
while
life
for
me
was
bright
and
young
he
robb
my
youth
he
quench
my
life
fair
ray
he
crush
my
mind
and
did
my
freedom
slay
and
at
this
i
be
his
wife
he
has
no
more
of
tenderness
from
me
than
any
other
wretch
of
guilty
life
less
for
i
know
his
household
privacy
i
see
him
as
he
is
without
a
screen
and
by
the
gods
my
soul
abhors
his
mien
has
he
not
sought
my
presence
dyed
in
blood
innocent
righteous
blood
shed
shamelessly
and
have
i
not
his
red
salute
withstood
ay
when
as
erst
he
plunged
all
galilee
in
dark
bereavement
in
affliction
sore
mingling
their
very
offerings
with
their
gore
then
came
he
in
his
eyes
a
upon
his
lips
some
false
endearing
word
and
through
the
streets
of
salem
clang
the
while
his
slaughtering
hacking
sacrilegious
sword
and
i
to
see
a
man
cause
men
such
woe
trembled
with
ire
i
did
not
fear
to
show
and
now
the
envious
jewish
priests
have
brought
jesus
whom
they
in
call
their
king
to
have
by
this
grim
power
their
vengeance
wrought
by
this
mean
reptile
innocence
to
sting
oh
could
i
but
the
purposed
doom
avert
and
shield
the
blameless
head
from
cruel
hurt
accessible
is
pilate
heart
to
fear
omens
will
shake
his
soul
like
autumn
leaf
could
he
this
night
appalling
vision
hear
this
just
man
bonds
were
loosed
his
life
were
safe
unless
that
bitter
priesthood
should
prevail
and
make
even
terror
to
their
malice
quail
yet
if
i
tell
the
dream
but
let
me
pause
what
dream
erewhile
the
characters
were
clear
graved
on
my
brain
at
once
some
unknown
cause
has
dimm
and
razed
the
thoughts
which
now
appear
like
a
vague
remnant
of
some
scene
not
what
will
be
but
what
long
since
has
been
i
suffer
many
things
i
heard
foretold
a
dreadful
doom
for
pilate
lingering
woes
in
far
barbarian
climes
where
mountains
cold
built
up
a
solitude
of
trackless
snows
there
he
and
grisly
wolves
prowl
side
by
side
there
he
lived
famish
there
methought
he
died
but
not
of
hunger
nor
by
malady
i
saw
the
snow
around
him
stain
with
gore
i
said
i
had
no
tears
for
such
as
he
and
lo
my
cheek
is
wet
mine
eyes
run
i
weep
for
mortal
suffering
mortal
guilt
i
weep
the
impious
deed
the
blood
more
i
recall
not
yet
the
vision
spread
into
a
world
remote
an
age
to
come
and
still
the
illumined
name
of
jesus
shed
a
light
a
clearness
through
the
unfolding
gloom
and
still
i
saw
that
sign
which
now
i
see
that
cross
on
yonder
brow
of
calvary
what
is
this
hebrew
christ
me
unknown
his
lineage
doctrine
mission
yet
how
clear
is
goodness
in
his
actions
shown
how
straight
and
stainless
is
his
life
career
the
ray
of
deity
that
rests
on
him
in
my
eyes
makes
olympian
glory
dim
the
world
advances
greek
or
roman
rite
suffices
not
the
inquiring
mind
to
stay
the
searching
soul
demands
a
purer
light
to
guide
it
on
its
upward
onward
way
ashamed
of
sculptured
gods
religion
turns
to
where
the
unseen
jehovah
altar
burns
our
faith
is
rotten
all
our
rites
defiled
our
temples
sullied
and
methinks
this
man
with
his
new
ordinance
so
wise
and
mild
is
come
even
as
he
says
the
chaff
to
fan
and
sever
from
the
wheat
but
will
his
faith
survive
the
terrors
of
death
i
feel
a
firmer
trust
a
higher
hope
rise
in
my
soul
it
dawns
with
dawning
day
lo
on
the
temple
roof
on
moriah
slope
appears
at
length
that
clear
and
crimson
ray
which
i
so
wished
for
when
shut
in
by
night
oh
opening
skies
i
hail
i
bless
pour
light
part
clouds
and
shadows
glorious
sun
appear
part
mental
gloom
come
insight
from
on
high
dusk
dawn
in
heaven
still
strives
with
daylight
clear
the
longing
soul
doth
still
uncertain
sigh
oh
to
behold
the
truth
that
sun
divine
how
doth
my
bosom
pant
my
spirit
pine
this
day
time
travails
with
a
mighty
birth
this
day
truth
stoops
from
heaven
and
visits
earth
ere
night
descends
i
shall
more
surely
know
what
guide
to
follow
in
what
path
to
go
i
wait
in
hope
i
wait
in
solemn
fear
the
oracle
of
god
the
sole
true
god
to
hear
mementos
arranging
drawers
and
shelves
of
cabinets
shut
up
for
years
what
a
strange
task
we
set
ourselves
how
still
the
lonely
room
appears
how
strange
this
mass
of
ancient
treasures
mementos
of
past
pains
and
pleasures
these
volumes
clasped
with
costly
stone
with
print
all
faded
gilding
gone
these
fans
of
leaves
from
indian
trees
these
crimson
shells
from
indian
seas
these
tiny
portraits
set
in
rings
once
doubtless
deemed
such
precious
things
keepsakes
bestowed
by
love
on
faith
and
worn
till
the
receiver
death
now
stored
with
cameos
china
shells
in
this
old
closet
dusty
cells
i
scarcely
think
for
ten
long
years
a
hand
has
touched
these
relics
old
and
coating
each
appears
the
growth
of
green
and
antique
mould
all
in
this
house
is
mossing
over
all
is
unused
and
dim
and
damp
nor
light
nor
warmth
the
rooms
discover
bereft
for
years
of
fire
and
lamp
the
sun
sometimes
in
summer
enters
the
casements
with
reviving
ray
but
the
long
rains
of
many
winters
moulder
the
very
walls
away
and
outside
all
is
ivy
clinging
to
chimney
lattice
gable
grey
scarcely
one
little
red
rose
springing
through
the
green
moss
can
force
its
way
unscared
the
daw
and
starling
nestle
where
the
tall
turret
rises
high
and
winds
alone
come
near
to
rustle
the
thick
leaves
where
their
cradles
lie
i
sometimes
think
when
late
at
even
i
climb
the
stair
reluctantly
some
shape
that
should
be
well
in
heaven
or
ill
elsewhere
will
pass
by
me
i
fear
to
see
the
very
faces
familiar
thirty
years
ago
even
in
the
old
accustomed
places
which
look
so
cold
and
gloomy
now
i
come
to
close
the
window
hither
at
twilight
when
the
sun
was
down
and
fear
my
very
soul
would
wither
lest
something
should
be
dimly
shown
too
much
the
buried
form
resembling
of
her
who
once
was
mistress
here
lest
doubtful
shade
or
moonbeam
trembling
might
take
her
aspect
once
so
dear
hers
was
this
chamber
in
her
time
it
seemed
to
me
a
pleasant
room
for
then
no
cloud
of
grief
or
crime
had
cursed
it
with
a
settled
gloom
i
had
not
seen
death
image
laid
in
shroud
and
sheet
on
yonder
bed
before
she
married
she
was
blest
blest
in
her
youth
blest
in
her
worth
her
mind
was
calm
its
sunny
rest
shone
in
her
eyes
more
clear
than
mirth
and
when
attired
in
rich
array
light
lustrous
hair
about
her
brow
she
yonder
sat
a
kind
of
day
lit
up
what
seems
so
gloomy
now
these
grim
oak
walls
even
then
were
grim
that
old
carved
chair
was
then
antique
but
what
around
looked
dusk
and
dim
served
as
a
foil
to
her
fresh
cheek
her
neck
and
arms
of
hue
so
fair
eyes
of
unclouded
smiling
light
her
soft
and
curled
and
floating
hair
gems
and
attire
as
rainbow
bright
reclined
in
yonder
deep
recess
ofttimes
she
would
at
evening
lie
watching
the
sun
she
seemed
to
bless
with
happy
glance
the
glorious
sky
she
loved
such
scenes
and
as
she
gazed
her
face
evinced
her
spirit
mood
beauty
or
grandeur
ever
raised
in
her
a
gratitude
but
of
all
lovely
things
she
loved
a
cloudless
moon
on
summer
night
full
oft
have
i
impatience
proved
to
see
how
long
her
still
delight
would
find
a
theme
in
reverie
out
on
the
lawn
or
where
the
trees
let
in
the
lustre
fitfully
as
their
boughs
parted
momently
to
the
soft
languid
summer
breeze
alas
that
she
should
have
flung
those
pure
though
lonely
joys
away
deceived
by
false
and
guileful
tongue
she
gave
her
hand
then
suffered
wrong
oppressed
she
faded
young
and
died
of
grief
by
slow
decay
open
that
how
bright
those
jewels
flash
upon
the
sight
the
brilliants
have
not
lost
a
ray
of
lustre
since
her
wedding
day
but
see
upon
that
pearly
chain
how
dim
lies
time
discolouring
stain
i
seen
that
by
her
daughter
worn
for
ere
she
died
a
child
was
born
a
child
that
its
mother
knew
that
lone
and
almost
friendless
grew
for
ever
when
its
step
drew
nigh
averted
was
the
father
eye
and
then
a
life
impure
and
wild
made
him
a
stranger
to
his
child
absorbed
in
vice
he
little
cared
on
what
she
did
or
how
she
fared
the
love
withheld
she
never
sought
she
grew
uncherished
learnt
untaught
to
her
the
inward
life
of
thought
full
soon
was
open
laid
i
know
not
if
her
friendlessness
did
sometimes
on
her
spirit
press
but
plaint
she
never
made
the
were
her
darling
treasure
she
rarely
seemed
the
time
to
measure
while
she
could
read
alone
and
she
too
loved
the
twilight
wood
and
often
in
her
mother
mood
away
to
yonder
hill
would
hie
like
her
to
watch
the
setting
sun
or
see
the
stars
born
one
by
one
out
of
the
darkening
sky
nor
would
she
leave
that
hill
till
night
trembled
from
pole
to
pole
with
light
even
then
upon
her
homeward
way
long
long
her
wandering
steps
delayed
to
quit
the
sombre
forest
shade
through
which
her
eerie
pathway
lay
you
ask
if
she
had
beauty
grace
i
know
not
but
a
nobler
face
my
eyes
have
seldom
seen
a
keen
and
fine
intelligence
and
better
still
the
truest
sense
were
in
her
speaking
mien
but
bloom
or
lustre
was
there
none
only
at
moments
fitful
shone
an
ardour
in
her
eye
that
kindled
on
her
cheek
a
flush
warm
as
a
red
sky
passing
blush
and
quick
with
energy
her
speech
too
was
not
common
speech
no
wish
to
shine
or
aim
to
teach
was
in
her
words
displayed
she
still
began
with
quiet
sense
but
oft
the
force
of
eloquence
came
to
her
lips
in
aid
language
and
voice
unconscious
changed
and
thoughts
in
other
words
arranged
her
fervid
soul
transfused
into
the
hearts
of
those
who
heard
and
transient
strength
and
ardour
stirred
in
minds
to
strength
unused
yet
in
gay
crowd
or
festal
glare
grave
and
retiring
was
her
air
was
seldom
save
with
me
alone
that
fire
of
feeling
freely
shone
she
loved
not
awe
nor
wonder
gaze
nor
even
exaggerated
praise
nor
even
notice
if
too
keen
the
curious
gazer
searched
her
mien
nature
own
green
expanse
revealed
the
world
the
pleasures
she
could
prize
on
free
in
sunny
field
in
quiet
spots
by
woods
concealed
grew
wild
and
fresh
her
chosen
joys
yet
nature
feelings
deeply
lay
in
that
endowed
and
youthful
frame
shrined
in
her
heart
and
hid
from
day
they
burned
unseen
with
silent
flame
in
youth
first
search
for
mental
light
she
lived
but
to
reflect
and
learn
but
soon
her
mind
maturer
might
for
stronger
task
did
pant
and
yearn
and
stronger
task
did
fate
assign
task
that
a
giant
strength
might
strain
to
suffer
long
and
repine
be
calm
in
frenzy
smile
at
pain
pale
with
the
secret
war
of
feeling
sustained
with
courage
mute
yet
high
the
wounds
at
which
she
bled
revealing
only
by
altered
cheek
and
eye
she
bore
in
silence
but
when
passion
surged
in
her
soul
with
ceaseless
foam
the
storm
at
last
brought
desolation
and
drove
her
exiled
from
her
home
and
silent
still
she
straight
assembled
the
wrecks
of
strength
her
soul
retained
for
though
the
wasted
body
trembled
the
unconquered
mind
to
quail
disdained
she
crossed
the
sea
now
lone
she
wanders
by
seine
or
rhine
or
arno
flow
fain
would
i
know
if
distance
renders
relief
or
comfort
to
her
woe
fain
would
i
know
if
henceforth
ever
these
eyes
shall
read
in
hers
again
that
light
of
love
which
faded
never
though
dimmed
so
long
with
secret
pain
she
will
return
but
cold
and
altered
like
all
whose
hopes
too
soon
depart
like
all
on
whom
have
beat
unsheltered
the
bitter
blasts
that
blight
the
heart
no
more
shall
i
behold
her
lying
calm
on
a
pillow
smoothed
by
me
no
more
that
spirit
worn
with
sighing
will
know
the
rest
of
infancy
if
still
the
paths
of
lore
she
follow
be
with
tired
and
goaded
will
she
only
toil
the
aching
hollow
the
joyless
blank
of
life
to
fill
and
oh
full
oft
quite
spent
and
weary
her
hand
will
pause
her
head
decline
that
labour
seems
so
hard
and
dreary
on
which
no
ray
of
hope
may
shine
thus
the
pale
blight
of
time
and
sorrow
will
shade
with
grey
her
soft
dark
hair
then
comes
the
day
that
knows
no
morrow
and
death
succeeds
to
long
despair
so
speaks
experience
sage
and
hoary
i
see
it
plainly
know
it
well
like
one
who
having
read
a
story
each
incident
therein
can
tell
touch
not
that
ring
was
his
the
sire
of
that
forsaken
child
and
nought
his
relics
can
inspire
save
memories
i
who
sat
by
his
wife
i
who
his
daughter
loved
could
almost
curse
the
guilty
dead
for
woes
the
guiltless
proved
and
heaven
did
curse
they
found
him
laid
when
crime
for
wrath
was
rife
cold
with
the
suicidal
blade
clutched
in
his
desperate
gripe
was
near
that
long
deserted
hut
which
in
the
wood
decays
death
axe
struck
his
root
and
lopped
his
desperate
days
you
know
the
spot
where
three
black
trees
lift
up
their
branches
fell
and
moaning
ceaseless
as
the
seas
still
seem
in
every
passing
breeze
the
deed
of
blood
to
tell
they
named
him
mad
and
laid
his
bones
where
holier
ashes
lie
yet
doubt
not
that
his
spirit
groans
in
hell
eternity
but
lo
night
closing
the
earth
infects
our
thoughts
with
gloom
come
let
us
strive
to
rally
mirth
where
glows
a
clear
and
tranquil
hearth
in
some
more
cheerful
room
the
wife
will
sit
still
a
word
a
breath
may
break
as
light
airs
stir
a
sleeping
lake
the
glassy
calm
that
soothes
my
woes
the
sweet
the
deep
the
full
repose
o
leave
me
not
for
ever
be
thus
more
than
life
itself
to
me
yes
close
beside
thee
let
me
kneel
give
me
thy
hand
that
i
may
feel
the
friend
so
true
so
tried
so
dear
my
heart
own
chosen
indeed
is
near
and
check
me
not
this
hour
divine
belongs
to
me
is
fully
mine
is
thy
own
hearth
thou
beside
after
long
absence
wandering
wide
is
thy
own
wife
reads
in
thine
eyes
a
promise
clear
of
stormless
skies
for
faith
and
true
love
light
the
rays
which
shine
responsive
to
her
gaze
ay
well
that
single
tear
may
fall
ten
thousand
might
mine
eyes
recall
which
from
their
lids
ran
blinding
fast
in
hours
of
grief
yet
scarcely
past
well
mayst
thou
speak
of
love
to
me
for
oh
most
truly
i
love
thee
yet
smile
for
we
are
happy
now
whence
then
that
sadness
on
thy
brow
what
sayst
thou
we
muse
once
again
ere
long
be
severed
by
the
main

knew
not
this
i
deemed
no
more
thy
step
would
err
from
britain
shore
duty
commands
is
true
is
just
thy
slightest
word
i
wholly
trust
nor
by
request
nor
faintest
sigh
would
i
to
turn
thy
purpose
try
but
william
hear
my
solemn
vow
hear
and
confirm
with
thee
i
go
distance
and
suffering
didst
thou
say
danger
by
night
and
toil
by
day
oh
idle
words
and
vain
are
these
hear
me
i
cross
with
thee
the
seas
such
risk
as
thou
must
meet
and
dare
i
thy
true
wife
will
duly
share
passive
at
home
i
will
not
pine

toils
thy
perils

be
mine
grant
this
and
be
hereafter
paid
by
a
warm
heart
devoted
aid
is
granted
with
that
yielding
kiss
entered
my
soul
unmingled
bliss
thanks
william
thanks
thy
love
has
joy
pure
undefiled
with
base
alloy
is
not
a
passion
false
and
blind
inspires
enchains
absorbs
my
mind
worthy
i
feel
art
thou
to
be
loved
with
my
perfect
energy
this
evening
now
shall
sweetly
flow
lit
by
our
clear
fire
happy
glow
and
parting
fear
is
warned
our
hearts
to
come
not
near
for
fate
admits
my
soul
decree
in
bliss
or
bale
to
go
with
thee
the
wood
but
two
miles
more
and
then
we
rest
well
there
is
still
an
hour
of
day
and
long
the
brightness
of
the
west
will
light
us
on
our
devious
way
sit
then
awhile
here
in
this
wood
so
total
is
the
solitude
we
safely
may
delay
these
massive
roots
afford
a
seat
which
seems
for
weary
travellers
made
there
rest
the
air
is
soft
and
sweet
in
this
sequestered
forest
glade
and
there
are
scents
of
flowers
around
the
evening
dew
draws
from
the
ground
how
soothingly
they
spread
yes
i
was
tired
but
not
at
heart
no
that
beats
full
of
sweet
content
for
now
i
have
my
natural
part
of
action
with
adventure
blent
cast
forth
on
the
wide
world
with
thee
and
all
my
once
waste
energy
to
weighty
purpose
bent
yet
sayst
thou
spies
around
us
roam
our
aims
are
termed
conspiracy
haply
no
more
our
english
home
an
anchorage
for
us
may
be
that
there
is
risk
our
mutual
blood
may
redden
in
some
lonely
wood
the
knife
of
treachery
sayst
thou
that
where
we
lodge
each
night
in
each
lone
farm
or
lonelier
hall
of
norman
peer
ere
morning
light
suspicion
must
as
duly
fall
as
day
returns
such
vigilance
presides
and
watches
over
france
such
rigour
governs
all
i
fear
not
william
dost
thou
fear
so
that
the
knife
does
not
divide
it
may
be
ever
hovering
near
i
could
not
tremble
at
thy
side
and
strenuous
love
like
mine
for
thee
is
buckler
strong
treachery
and
turns
its
stab
aside
i
am
resolved
that
thou
shalt
learn
to
trust
my
strength
as
i
trust
thine
i
am
resolved
our
souls
shall
burn
with
equal
steady
mingling
shine
part
of
the
field
is
conquered
now
our
lives
in
the
same
channel
flow
along
the
line
and
while
no
groaning
storm
is
heard
thou
content
it
should
be
so
but
soon
as
comes
a
warning
word
of
danger
straight
thine
anxious
brow
bends
over
me
a
mournful
shade
as
doubting
if
my
powers
are
made
to
ford
the
floods
of
woe
know
then
it
is
my
spirit
swells
and
drinks
with
eager
joy
the
air
of
freedom
where
at
last
it
dwells
chartered
a
common
task
to
share
with
thee
and
then
it
stirs
alert
and
pants
to
learn
what
menaced
hurt
demands
for
thee
its
care
remember
i
have
crossed
the
deep
and
stood
with
thee
on
deck
to
gaze
on
waves
that
rose
in
threatening
heap
while
stagnant
lay
a
heavy
haze
dimly
confusing
sea
with
sky
and
baffling
even
the
pilot
eye
intent
to
thread
the
maze
of
rocks
on
bretagne
dangerous
coast
and
find
a
way
to
steer
our
band
to
the
one
point
obscure
which
lost
flung
us
as
victims
on
the
strand
all
elsewhere
gleamed
the
gallic
sword
and
not
a
wherry
could
be
moored
along
the
guarded
land
i
feared
not
then
i
fear
not
now
the
interest
of
each
stirring
scene
wakes
a
new
sense
a
welcome
glow
in
every
nerve
and
bounding
vein
alike
on
turbid
channel
sea
or
in
still
wood
of
normandy
i
feel
as
born
again
the
rain
descended
that
wild
morn
when
anchoring
in
the
cove
at
last
our
band
all
weary
and
forlorn
ashore
like
sailors
cast
sought
for
a
sheltering
roof
in
vain
and
scarce
could
scanty
food
obtain
to
break
their
morning
fast
thou
didst
thy
crust
with
me
divide
thou
didst
thy
cloak
around
me
fold
and
sitting
silent
by
thy
side
i
ate
the
bread
in
peace
untold
given
kindly
from
thy
hand
was
sweet
as
costly
fare
or
princely
treat
on
royal
plate
of
gold
sharp
blew
the
sleet
upon
my
face
and
rising
wild
the
gusty
wind
drove
on
those
thundering
waves
apace
our
crew
so
late
had
left
behind
but
spite
of
frozen
shower
and
storm
so
close
to
thee
my
heart
beat
warm
and
tranquil
slept
my
mind
so
now
nor
nor
opprest
with
walking
all
this
august
day
i
taste
a
heaven
in
this
brief
rest
this
beside
the
way
england
wild
flowers
are
fair
to
view
like
balm
is
england
summer
dew
like
gold
her
sunset
ray
but
the
white
violets
growing
here
are
sweeter
than
i
yet
have
seen
and
did
dew
so
pure
and
clear
distil
on
forest
mosses
green
as
now
called
forth
by
summer
heat
perfumes
our
cool
and
fresh
retreat
these
fragrant
limes
between
that
sunset
look
beneath
the
boughs
over
the
copse
beyond
the
hills
how
soft
yet
deep
and
warm
it
glows
and
heaven
with
rich
suffusion
fills
with
hues
where
still
the
opal
tint
its
gleam
of
prisoned
fire
is
blent
where
flame
through
azure
thrills
depart
we
now
for
fast
will
fade
that
solemn
splendour
of
decline
and
deep
must
be
the
as
stars
alone
will
shine
no
moon
is
destined
pale
to
gaze
on
such
a
day
vast
phoenix
blaze
a
day
in
fires
decayed
there
we
tread
again
the
mazes
of
this
varying
wood
and
soon
amid
a
cultured
plain
girt
in
with
fertile
solitude
we
shall
our
descry
marked
by
one
towering
high
above
a
farmstead
rude
refreshed
erelong
with
rustic
fare
we
seek
a
couch
of
dreamless
ease
courage
will
guard
thy
heart
from
fear
and
love
give
mine
divinest
peace
brings
more
dangerous
toil
and
through
its
conflict
and
turmoil
we
pass
as
god
shall
please
the
preceding
composition
refers
doubtless
to
the
scenes
acted
in
france
during
the
last
year
of
the
consulate
frances
she
will
not
sleep
for
fear
of
dreams
but
rising
quits
her
restless
bed
and
walks
where
some
beclouded
beams
of
moonlight
through
the
hall
are
shed
obedient
to
the
goad
of
grief
her
steps
now
fast
now
lingering
slow
in
varying
motion
seek
relief
from
the
eumenides
of
woe
wringing
her
hands
at
intervals
but
long
as
mute
as
phantom
dim
she
glides
along
the
dusky
walls
under
the
black
oak
rafters
grim
the
close
air
of
the
grated
tower
stifles
a
heart
that
scarce
can
beat
and
though
so
late
and
lone
the
hour
forth
pass
her
wandering
faltering
feet
and
on
the
pavement
spread
before
the
long
front
of
the
mansion
grey
her
steps
imprint
the
hoar
which
pale
on
grass
and
granite
lay
not
long
she
stayed
where
misty
moon
and
shimmering
stars
could
on
her
look
but
through
the
garden
archway
soon
her
strange
and
gloomy
path
she
took
some
firs
coeval
with
the
tower
their
straight
black
boughs
stretched
her
head
unseen
beneath
this
sable
bower
rustled
her
dress
and
rapid
tread
there
was
an
alcove
in
that
shade
screening
a
rustic
seat
and
stand
weary
she
sat
her
down
and
laid
her
hot
brow
on
her
burning
hand
to
solitude
and
to
the
night
some
words
she
now
in
murmurs
said
and
trickling
through
her
fingers
white
some
tears
of
misery
she
shed
god
help
me
in
my
grievous
need
god
help
me
in
my
inward
pain
which
can
not
ask
for
pity
meed
which
has
no
licence
to
complain
which
must
be
borne
yet
who
can
bear
hours
long
days
long
a
constant
weight
the
yoke
of
absolute
despair
a
suffering
wholly
desolate
who
can
for
ever
crush
the
heart
restrain
its
throbbing
curb
its
life
dissemble
truth
with
ceaseless
art
with
outward
calm
mask
inward
strife
she
waited
as
for
some
reply
the
still
and
cloudy
night
gave
none
ere
long
with
trembling
sigh
her
heavy
plaint
again
begun
unloved
i
love
unwept
i
weep
grief
i
restrain
hope
i
repress
vain
is
this
anguish
fixed
and
deep
vainer
desires
and
dreams
of
bliss
my
love
awakes
no
love
again
my
tears
collect
and
fall
unfelt
my
sorrow
touches
none
with
pain
my
humble
hopes
to
nothing
melt
for
me
the
universe
is
dumb
and
blank
and
wholly
blind
life
i
must
bound
existence
sum
in
the
strait
limits
of
one
mind
that
mind
my
own
oh
narrow
cell
dark
imageless
a
living
tomb
there
must
i
sleep
there
wake
and
dwell
content
with
palsy
pain
and
gloom
again
she
paused
a
moan
of
pain
a
stifled
sob
alone
was
heard
long
silence
followed
then
again
her
voice
the
stagnant
midnight
stirred
must
it
be
so
is
this
my
fate
can
i
nor
struggle
nor
contend
and
am
i
doomed
for
years
to
wait
watching
death
lingering
axe
descend
and
when
it
falls
and
when
i
die
what
follows
vacant
nothingness
the
blank
of
lost
identity
erasure
both
of
pain
and
bliss
i
heard
of
heaven
i
would
believe
for
if
this
earth
indeed
be
all
who
longest
lives
may
deepest
grieve
most
blest
whom
sorrows
soonest
call
oh
leaving
disappointment
here
will
man
find
hope
on
yonder
coast
hope
which
on
earth
shines
never
clear
and
oft
in
clouds
is
wholly
lost
will
he
hope
source
of
light
behold
fruition
spring
where
doubts
expire
and
drink
in
waves
of
living
gold
contentment
full
for
long
desire
will
he
find
bliss
which
here
he
dreamed
rest
which
was
weariness
on
earth
knowledge
which
if
life
it
beamed
served
but
to
prove
it
void
of
worth
will
he
find
love
without
lust
leaven
love
fearless
tearless
perfect
pure
to
all
with
equal
bounty
given
in
all
unfeigned
unfailing
sure
will
he
from
penal
sufferings
free
released
from
shroud
and
wormy
clod
all
calm
and
glorious
rise
and
see
creation
sire
existence
god
then
glancing
back
on
time
brief
woes
will
he
behold
them
fading
fly
swept
from
eternity
repose
like
sullying
cloud
from
pure
blue
sky
if
so
endure
my
weary
frame
and
when
thy
anguish
strikes
too
deep
and
when
all
troubled
burns
life
flame
think
of
the
quiet
final
sleep
think
of
the
glorious
which
will
not
dawn
on
grief
and
tears
but
on
a
ransomed
spirit
power
certain
and
free
from
mortal
fears
seek
now
thy
couch
and
lie
till
morn
then
from
thy
chamber
calm
descend
with
mind
nor
tossed
nor
but
tranquil
fixed
to
wait
the
end
and
when
thy
opening
eyes
shall
see
mementos
on
the
chamber
wall
of
one
who
has
forgotten
thee
shed
not
the
tear
of
acrid
gall
the
tear
which
welling
from
the
heart
burns
where
its
drop
corrosive
falls
and
makes
each
nerve
in
torture
start
at
feelings
it
too
well
recalls
when
the
sweet
hope
of
being
loved
threw
eden
sunshine
on
life
way
when
every
sense
and
feeling
proved
expectancy
of
brightest
day
when
the
hand
trembled
to
receive
a
thrilling
clasp
which
seemed
so
near
and
the
heart
ventured
to
believe
another
heart
esteemed
it
dear
when
words
half
love
all
tenderness
were
hourly
heard
as
hourly
spoken
when
the
long
sunny
days
of
bliss
only
by
moonlight
nights
were
broken
till
drop
by
drop
the
cup
of
joy
filled
full
with
purple
light
was
glowing
and
faith
which
watched
it
sparkling
high
still
never
dreamt
the
overflowing
it
fell
not
with
a
sudden
crashing
it
poured
not
out
like
open
sluice
no
sparkling
still
and
redly
flashing
drained
drop
by
drop
the
generous
juice
i
saw
it
sink
and
strove
to
taste
it
my
eager
lips
approached
the
brim
the
movement
only
seemed
to
waste
it
it
sank
to
dregs
all
harsh
and
dim
these
i
have
drunk
and
they
for
ever
have
poisoned
life
and
love
for
me
a
draught
from
sodom
lake
could
never
more
fiery
salt
and
bitter
be
oh
love
was
all
a
thin
illusion
joy
but
the
desert
flying
stream
and
glancing
back
on
long
delusion
my
memory
grasps
a
hollow
dream
yet
whence
that
wondrous
change
of
feeling
i
never
knew
and
can
not
learn
nor
why
my
lover
eye
congealing
grew
cold
and
clouded
proud
and
stern
nor
wherefore
friendship
forms
forgetting
he
careless
left
and
cool
withdrew
nor
spoke
of
grief
nor
fond
regretting
nor
one
glance
of
comfort
threw
and
neither
word
nor
token
sending
of
kindness
since
the
parting
day
his
course
for
distant
regions
bending
went
and
calm
away
oh
bitter
blighting
keen
sensation
which
will
not
weaken
can
not
die
hasten
thy
work
of
desolation
and
let
my
tortured
spirit
fly
vain
as
the
passing
gale
my
crying
though
i
must
live
on
i
know
at
heart
there
is
no
dying
of
love
and
ruined
hope
alone
still
strong
and
young
and
warm
with
vigour
though
scathed
i
long
shall
greenly
grow
and
many
a
storm
of
wildest
rigour
shall
yet
break
my
shivered
bough
rebellious
now
to
blank
inertion
my
unused
strength
demands
a
task
travel
and
toil
and
full
exertion
are
the
last
only
boon
i
ask
whence
then
this
vain
and
barren
dreaming
of
death
and
dubious
life
to
come
i
see
a
nearer
beacon
gleaming
over
dejection
sea
of
gloom
the
very
wildness
of
my
sorrow
tells
me
i
yet
have
innate
force
my
track
of
life
has
been
too
narrow
effort
shall
trace
a
broader
course
the
world
is
not
in
yonder
tower
earth
is
not
prisoned
in
that
room
whose
dark
panels
hour
by
hour
i
sat
the
slave
and
prey
of
gloom
one
feeling
turned
to
utter
anguish
is
not
my
being
only
aim
when
lorn
and
loveless
life
will
languish
but
courage
can
revive
the
flame
he
when
he
left
me
went
a
roving
to
sunny
climes
beyond
the
sea
and
i
the
weight
of
woe
removing
am
free
and
fetterless
as
he
new
scenes
new
language
skies
less
clouded
may
once
more
wake
the
wish
to
live
strange
foreign
towns
astir
and
crowded
new
pictures
to
the
mind
may
give
new
forms
and
faces
passing
ever
may
hide
the
one
i
still
retain
defined
and
fixed
and
fading
never
stamped
deep
on
vision
heart
and
brain
and
we
might
meet
time
may
have
changed
him
chance
may
reveal
the
mystery
the
secret
influence
which
estranged
him
love
may
restore
him
yet
to
me
false
thought
false
hope
in
scorn
be
banished
i
am
not
loved
nor
loved
have
been
recall
not
then
the
dreams
scarce
vanished
traitors
mislead
me
not
again
to
words
like
yours
i
bid
defiance
is
such
my
mental
wreck
have
made
of
god
alone
and
i
ask
for
solace
hope
for
aid
morn
comes
and
ere
meridian
glory
these
my
natal
woods
shall
smile
both
lonely
wood
and
mansion
hoary
i
leave
behind
full
many
a
mile
gilbert
i
the
garden
above
the
city
hung
the
moon
right
a
plot
of
ground
where
flowers
and
were
fenced
with
lofty
walls
around
was
gilbert
garden
there
awhile
he
walked
alone
and
tired
with
sedentary
toil
mused
where
the
moonlight
shone
this
garden
in
a
lay
still
as
houseless
wild
though
mansion
fronts
were
round
it
closely
piled
but
thick
their
walls
and
those
within
lived
lives
by
noise
unstirred
like
wafting
of
an
angel
wing
time
flight
by
them
was
heard
some
soft
alone
were
sweet
as
faintly
given
where
ladies
doubtless
cheered
the
hearth
with
song
that
the
city
sounds
rose
like
the
hum
of
ocean
they
rather
lulled
the
heart
than
roused
its
pulse
to
faster
motion
gilbert
has
paced
the
single
walk
an
hour
yet
is
not
weary
and
though
it
be
a
winter
night
he
feels
nor
cold
nor
dreary
the
prime
of
life
is
in
his
veins
and
sends
his
blood
fast
flowing
and
fancy
fervour
warms
the
thoughts
now
in
his
bosom
glowing
those
thoughts
recur
to
early
love
or
what
he
love
would
name
though
haply
gilbert
secret
deeds
might
other
title
claim
such
theme
not
oft
his
mind
absorbs
he
to
the
world
clings
fast
and
too
much
for
the
present
lives
to
linger
the
past
but
now
the
evening
deep
repose
has
glided
to
his
soul
that
moonlight
falls
on
memory
and
shows
her
fading
scroll
one
name
appears
in
every
line
the
gentle
rays
shine
and
still
he
smiles
and
still
repeats
that
one
name
elinor
there
is
no
sorrow
in
his
smile
no
kindness
in
his
tone
the
triumph
of
a
selfish
heart
speaks
coldly
there
alone
he
says
she
loved
me
more
than
life
and
truly
it
was
sweet
to
see
so
fair
a
woman
kneel
in
bondage
at
my
feet
there
was
a
sort
of
quiet
bliss
to
be
so
deeply
loved
to
gaze
on
trembling
eagerness
and
sit
myself
unmoved
and
when
it
pleased
my
pride
to
grant
at
last
some
rare
caress
to
feel
the
fever
of
that
hand
my
fingers
deigned
to
press
was
sweet
to
see
her
strive
to
hide
what
every
glance
revealed
endowed
the
while
with
her
destiny
to
wield
i
knew
myself
no
perfect
man
nor
as
she
deemed
divine
i
knew
that
i
was
glorious
but
by
her
reflected
shine
her
youth
her
native
energy
her
powers
and
fresh
was
these
with
godhead
sanctified
my
sensual
frame
of
flesh
yet
like
a
god
did
i
descend
at
last
to
meet
her
love
and
like
a
god
i
then
withdrew
to
my
own
heaven
above
and
never
more
could
she
invoke
my
presence
to
her
sphere
no
prayer
no
plaint
no
cry
of
hers
could
win
my
awful
ear
i
knew
her
blinded
constancy
would
my
deeds
betray
and
calm
in
conscience
whole
in
heart
i
went
my
tranquil
way
yet
sometimes
i
still
feel
a
wish
the
fond
and
flattering
pain
of
passion
anguish
to
create
in
her
young
breast
again
bright
was
the
lustre
of
her
eyes
when
they
caught
fire
from
mine
if
i
had
power
this
very
hour
again
i
light
their
shine
but
where
she
is
or
how
she
lives
i
have
no
clue
to
know
i
heard
she
long
my
absence
pined
and
left
her
home
in
woe
but
busied
then
in
gathering
gold
as
i
am
busied
now
i
could
not
turn
from
such
pursuit
to
weep
a
broken
vow
nor
could
i
give
to
fatal
risk
the
fame
i
ever
prized
even
now
i
fear
that
precious
fame
is
too
much
compromised
an
inward
trouble
dims
his
eye
some
riddle
he
would
solve
some
method
to
unloose
a
knot
his
anxious
thoughts
revolve
he
pensive
leans
against
a
tree
a
leafy
evergreen
the
boughs
the
moonlight
intercept
and
hide
him
like
a
screen
he
starts
the
tree
shakes
with
his
tremor
yet
nothing
near
him
pass
he
hurries
up
the
garden
alley
in
strangely
sudden
haste
with
shaking
hand
he
lifts
the
latchet
steps
the
threshold
stone
the
heavy
door
slips
from
his
fingers
it
shuts
and
he
is
gone
what
touched
transfixed
appalled
his
soul
a
nervous
thought
no
more
sink
like
stone
in
placid
pool
and
calm
close
smoothly
ii
the
parlour
warm
is
the
parlour
atmosphere
serene
the
lamp
soft
light
the
vivid
embers
red
and
clear
proclaim
a
frosty
night
books
varied
on
the
table
lie
three
children
them
bend
and
all
with
curious
eager
eye
the
turning
leaf
attend
picture
and
tale
alternately
their
simple
hearts
delight
and
interest
deep
and
tempered
glee
illume
their
aspects
bright
the
parents
from
their
fireside
place
behold
that
pleasant
scene
and
joy
is
on
the
mother
face
pride
in
the
father
mien
as
gilbert
sees
his
blooming
wife
beholds
his
children
fair
no
thought
has
he
of
transient
strife
or
past
though
piercing
fear
the
voice
of
happy
infancy
lisps
sweetly
in
his
ear
his
wife
with
pleased
and
peaceful
eye
sits
kindly
smiling
near
the
fire
glows
on
her
silken
dress
and
shows
its
ample
grace
and
warmly
tints
each
hazel
tress
curled
soft
around
her
face
the
beauty
that
in
youth
he
wooed
is
beauty
still
unfaded
the
brow
of
ever
placid
mood
no
churlish
grief
has
shaded
prosperity
in
gilbert
home
abides
the
guest
of
years
there
want
or
discord
never
come
and
seldom
toil
or
tears
the
carpets
bear
the
peaceful
print
of
comfort
velvet
tread
and
golden
gleams
from
plenty
sent
in
every
nook
are
shed
the
very
silken
spaniel
seems
of
quiet
ease
to
tell
as
near
its
mistress
feet
it
dreams
sunk
in
a
cushion
swell
and
smiles
seem
native
to
the
eyes
of
those
sweet
children
three
they
have
but
looked
on
tranquil
skies
and
know
not
misery
alas
that
misery
should
come
in
such
an
hour
as
this
why
could
she
not
so
calm
a
home
a
little
longer
miss
but
she
is
now
within
the
door
her
steps
advancing
glide
her
sullen
shade
has
crossed
the
floor
she
stands
at
gilbert
side
she
lays
her
hand
upon
his
heart
it
bounds
with
agony
his
fireside
chair
shakes
with
the
start
that
shook
the
garden
tree
his
wife
towards
the
children
looks
she
does
not
mark
his
mien
the
children
bending
their
books
his
terror
have
not
seen
in
his
own
home
by
his
own
hearth
he
sits
in
solitude
and
circled
round
with
light
and
mirth
cold
horror
chills
his
blood
his
mind
would
hold
with
desperate
clutch
the
scene
that
round
him
lies
no
changed
as
by
some
wizard
touch
the
present
prospect
flies
a
tumult
vague
a
viewless
strife
his
futile
struggles
crush
him
and
his
an
unknown
life
and
unknown
feelings
rush
he
sees
but
scarce
can
language
paint
the
tissue
fancy
weaves
for
words
oft
give
but
echo
faint
of
thoughts
the
mind
conceives
noise
tumult
strange
and
darkness
dim
efface
both
light
and
quiet
no
shape
is
in
those
shadows
grim
no
voice
in
that
wild
riot
sustain
and
strong
a
wondrous
blast
above
and
round
him
blows
a
greenish
gloom
dense
overcast
each
moment
denser
grows
he
nothing
knows
nor
clearly
sees
resistance
checks
his
breath
the
high
impetuous
ceaseless
breeze
blows
on
him
cold
as
death
and
still
the
undulating
gloom
mocks
sight
with
formless
motion
was
such
sensation
jonah
doom
gulphed
in
the
depths
of
ocean
streaking
the
air
the
nameless
vision
flows
oh
whence
its
source
and
what
its
mission
how
will
its
terrors
close
rushing
vast
and
void
the
universe
it
swallows
and
still
the
dark
devouring
tide
a
typhoon
tempest
follows
more
slow
it
rolls
its
furious
race
sinks
to
its
solemn
gliding
the
stunning
roar
the
wind
wild
chase
to
stillness
are
subsiding
and
slowly
borne
along
a
form
the
shapeless
chaos
varies
poised
in
the
eddy
to
the
storm
before
the
eye
it
tarries
a
woman
drowned
sunk
in
the
deep
on
a
long
wave
reclining
the
circling
waters
crystal
sweep
like
glass
her
shape
enshrining
her
pale
dead
face
to
gilbert
turned
seems
as
in
sleep
reposing
a
feeble
light
now
first
discerned
the
features
well
disclosing
no
effort
from
the
haunted
air
the
ghastly
scene
could
banish
that
hovering
wave
arrested
there
rolled
throbbed
but
did
not
vanish
if
gilbert
upward
turned
his
gaze
he
saw
the
if
he
looked
down
the
endless
seas
lay
green
as
summer
meadow
and
straight
before
the
pale
corpse
lay
upborne
by
air
or
billow
so
near
he
could
have
touched
the
spray
that
churned
around
its
pillow
the
hollow
anguish
of
the
face
had
moved
a
fiend
to
sorrow
not
death
fixed
calm
could
rase
the
trace
of
suffering
furrow
all
moved
a
strong
returning
blast
the
mass
of
waters
raising
bore
wave
and
passive
carcase
past
while
gilbert
yet
was
gazing
deep
in
her
womb
it
seemed
the
ocean
thundered
and
soon
by
realms
of
rushing
gloom
were
seer
and
phantom
sundered
then
swept
some
timbers
from
a
wreck
on
following
surges
riding
then
in
the
turbid
rack
uptorn
went
slowly
gliding
the
horrid
shade
by
slow
degrees
a
beam
of
light
defeated
and
then
the
roar
of
raving
seas
fast
far
and
faint
retreated
and
all
was
gone
gone
like
a
mist
corse
billows
tempest
wreck
three
children
close
to
gilbert
prest
and
clung
around
his
neck
good
night
good
night
the
prattlers
said
and
kissed
their
father
cheek
was
now
the
hour
their
quiet
bed
and
placid
rest
to
seek
the
mother
with
her
offspring
goes
to
hear
their
evening
prayer
she
nought
of
gilbert
vision
knows
and
nought
of
his
despair
yet
pitying
god
abridge
the
time
of
anguish
now
his
fate
though
haply
great
has
been
his
crime
thy
mercy
too
is
great
gilbert
at
length
uplifts
his
head
bent
for
some
moments
low
and
there
is
neither
grief
nor
dread
upon
his
subtle
brow
for
well
can
he
his
feelings
task
and
well
his
looks
command
his
features
well
his
heart
can
mask
with
smiles
and
smoothness
bland
gilbert
has
reasoned
with
his
mind
he
says
was
all
a
dream
he
strives
his
inward
sight
to
blind
against
truth
inward
beam
he
pitied
not
that
shadowy
thing
when
it
was
flesh
and
blood
nor
now
can
pity
balmy
spring
refresh
his
arid
mood
and
if
that
dream
has
spoken
truth
thus
musingly
he
says
if
elinor
be
dead
in
sooth
such
chance
the
shock
repays
a
net
was
woven
round
my
feet
i
scarce
could
further
go
ere
shame
had
forced
a
fast
retreat
dishonour
brought
me
low
conceal
her
then
deep
silent
sea
give
her
a
secret
grave
she
sleeps
in
peace
and
i
am
free
no
longer
terror
slave
and
homage
still
from
all
the
world
shall
greet
my
spotless
name
since
surges
break
and

are
curled
above
its
threatened
shame
iii

is
somewhat
late
the
city
clocks
twelve
deep
vibrations
toll
as
gilbert
at
the
portal
knocks
which
is
his
journey
goal
the
street
is
still
and
desolate
the
moon
hid
by
a
cloud
gilbert
impatient
will
not
wait
his
second
knock
peals
loud
the
clocks
are
hushed
there
not
a
light
in
any
window
nigh
and
not
a
single
planet
bright
looks
from
the
clouded
sky
the
air
is
raw
the
rain
descends
a
bitter
blows
his
cloak
the
traveller
scarce
defends
will
not
the
door
unclose
he
knocks
the
third
time
and
the
last
his
summons
now
they
hear
within
a
footstep
hurrying
fast
is
heard
approaching
near
the
bolt
is
drawn
the
clanking
chain
falls
to
the
floor
of
stone
and
gilbert
to
his
heart
will
strain
his
wife
and
children
soon
the
hand
that
lifts
the
latchet
holds
a
candle
to
his
sight
and
gilbert
on
the
step
beholds
a
woman
clad
in
white
lo
water
from
her
dripping
dress
runs
on
the
streaming
floor
from
every
dark
and
clinging
tress
the
drops
incessant
pour
there
none
but
her
to
welcome
him
she
holds
the
candle
high
and
motionless
in
form
and
limb
stands
cold
and
silent
nigh
there
sand
and
on
her
robe
her
hollow
eyes
are
blind
no
pulse
in
such
a
frame
can
throb
no
life
is
there
defined
gilbert
turned
but
still
his
lips
vouchsafed
no
cry
he
spurred
his
strength
and
to
pass
the
figure
by
but
moving
slow
it
faced
him
straight
it
would
not
flinch
nor
quail
then
first
did
gilbert
strength
abate
his
stony
firmness
quail
he
sank
upon
his
knees
and
prayed
the
shape
stood
rigid
there
he
called
aloud
for
human
aid
no
human
aid
was
near
an
accent
strange
did
thus
repeat
heaven
stern
but
just
decree
the
measure
thou
to
her
didst
mete
to
thee
shall
measured
be
gilbert
sprang
from
his
bended
knees
by
the
pale
spectre
pushed
and
wild
as
one
whom
demons
seize
up
the
rushed
entered
his
chamber
near
the
bed
sheathed
steel
and
hung
impelled
by
maniac
purpose
dread
he
chose
those
stores
among
across
his
throat
a
knife
with
vigorous
hand
he
drew
the
wound
was
wide
his
outraged
life
rushed
rash
and
redly
through
and
thus
died
by
a
shameful
death
a
wise
and
worldly
man
who
never
drew
but
selfish
breath
since
first
his
life
began
life
life
believe
is
not
a
dream
so
dark
as
sages
say
oft
a
little
morning
rain
foretells
a
pleasant
day
sometimes
there
are
clouds
of
gloom
but
these
are
transient
all
if
the
shower
will
make
the
roses
bloom
o
why
lament
its
fall
rapidly
merrily
life
sunny
hours
flit
by
gratefully
cheerily
enjoy
them
as
they
fly
what
though
death
at
times
steps
in
and
calls
our
best
away
what
though
sorrow
seems
to
win
hope
a
heavy
sway
yet
hope
again
elastic
springs
unconquered
though
she
fell
still
buoyant
are
her
golden
wings
still
strong
to
bear
us
well
manfully
fearlessly
the
day
of
trial
bear
for
gloriously
victoriously
can
courage
quell
despair
the
letter
what
is
she
writing
watch
her
now
how
fast
her
fingers
move
how
eagerly
her
youthful
brow
is
bent
in
thought
above
her
long
curls
drooping
shade
the
light
she
puts
them
quick
aside
nor
knows
that
band
of
crystals
bright
her
hasty
touch
untied
it
slips
adown
her
silken
dress
falls
glittering
at
her
feet
unmarked
it
falls
for
she
no
less
pursues
her
labour
sweet
the
very
loveliest
hour
that
shines
is
in
that
deep
blue
sky
the
golden
sun
of
june
declines
it
has
not
caught
her
eye
the
cheerful
lawn
and
unclosed
gate
the
white
road
far
away
in
vain
for
her
light
footsteps
wait
she
comes
not
forth
there
is
an
open
door
of
glass
close
by
that
lady
chair
from
thence
to
slopes
of
messy
grass
descends
a
marble
stair
tall
plants
of
bright
and
spicy
bloom
around
the
threshold
grow
their
leaves
and
blossoms
shade
the
room
from
that
sun
deepening
glow
why
does
she
not
a
moment
glance
between
the
clustering
flowers
and
mark
in
heaven
the
radiant
dance
of
evening
rosy
hours
o
look
again
still
fixed
her
eye
unsmiling
earnest
still
and
fast
her
pen
and
fingers
fly
urged
by
her
eager
will
her
soul
is
in
task
to
whom
then
doth
she
write
nay
watch
her
still
more
closely
ask
her
own
eyes
serious
light
where
do
they
turn
as
now
her
pen
hangs
line
whence
fell
the
tearful
gleam
that
then
did
in
their
dark
spheres
shine
the
looks
so
dark
when
from
that
sky
you
turn
and
from
of
that
green
park
you
scarce
may
aught
discern
yet
the
piles
of
porcelain
rare
couch
and
vase
sloped
as
if
leaning
on
the
air
one
picture
meets
the
gaze
is
there
she
turns
you
may
not
see
distinct
what
form
defines
the
clouded
mass
of
mystery
yon
broad
gold
frame
confines
but
look
again
inured
to
shade
your
eyes
now
faintly
trace
a
stalwart
form
a
massive
head
a
firm
determined
face
black
spanish
locks
a
sunburnt
cheek
a
brow
high
broad
and
white
where
every
furrow
seems
to
speak
of
mind
and
moral
might
is
that
her
god
i
can
not
tell
her
eye
a
moment
met
picture
then
it
fell
darkened
and
dimmed
and
wet
a
moment
more
her
task
is
done
and
sealed
the
letter
lies
and
now
towards
the
setting
sun
she
turns
her
tearful
eyes
those
tears
flow
over
wonder
not
for
by
the
inscription
see
in
what
a
strange
and
distant
spot
her
heart
of
hearts
must
be
three
seas
and
many
a
league
of
land
that
letter
must
pass
ere
read
by
him
to
whose
loved
hand
is
sent
from
england
shore
remote
colonial
wilds
detain
her
husband
loved
though
stern
she
that
smiling
english
scene
weeps
for
his
wished
return
regret
long
ago
i
wished
to
leave
the
house
where
i
was
born
long
ago
i
used
to
grieve
my
home
seemed
so
forlorn
in
other
years
its
silent
rooms
were
filled
with
haunting
fears
now
their
very
memory
comes
with
tender
tears
life
and
marriage
i
have
known
things
once
deemed
so
bright
now
how
utterly
is
flown
every
ray
of
light
the
unknown
sea
of
life
i
no
blest
isle
have
found
at
last
through
all
its
wild
wave
strife
my
bark
is
homeward
bound
farewell
dark
and
rolling
deep
farewell
foreign
shore
open
in
unclouded
sweep
thou
glorious
realm
before
yet
though
i
had
safely
that
weary
vexed
main
one
loved
voice
through
surge
and
blast
could
call
me
back
again
though
the
soul
bright
morning
rose
paradise
for
me
william
even
from
heaven
repose
i
turn
invoked
by
thee
storm
nor
surge
should
arrest
my
soul
exalting
then
all
my
heaven
was
once
thy
breast
would
it
were
mine
again
presentiment
sister
you
sat
there
all
the
day
come
to
the
hearth
awhile
the
wind
so
wildly
sweeps
away
the
clouds
so
darkly
pile
that
open
book
has
lain
unread
for
hours
upon
your
knee
you
never
smiled
nor
turned
your
head
what
can
you
sister
see
come
hither
jane
look
down
the
field
how
dense
a
mist
creeps
on
the
path
the
hedge
are
both
concealed
the
white
gate
is
gone
no
landscape
through
the
fog
i
trace
no
hill
with
pastures
green
all
featureless
is
nature
face
all
masked
in
clouds
her
mien
scarce
is
the
rustle
of
a
leaf
heard
in
our
garden
now
the
year
grows
old
its
days
wax
brief
the
tresses
leave
its
brow
the
rain
drives
fast
before
the
wind
the
sky
is
blank
and
grey
o
jane
what
sadness
fills
the
mind
on
such
a
dreary
day
you
think
too
much
my
sister
dear
you
sit
too
long
alone
what
though
november
days
be
drear
full
soon
will
they
be
gone
i
swept
the
hearth
and
placed
your
chair
come
emma
sit
by
me
our
own
fireside
is
never
drear
though
late
and
wintry
wane
the
year
though
rough
the
night
may
be
the
peaceful
glow
of
our
fireside
imparts
no
peace
to
me
my
thoughts
would
rather
wander
wide
than
rest
dear
jane
with
thee
i
on
a
distant
journey
bound
and
if
about
my
heart
too
closely
kindred
ties
were
bound
break
when
forced
to
part
will
november
days
be
well
have
you
spoken
jane
my
own
forebodings
tell
me
more
for
me
i
know
by
presage
sure
they
return
again
ere
long
nor
sun
nor
storm
to
me
will
bring
or
joy
or
gloom
they
reach
not
that
eternity
which
soon
will
be
my
home
eight
months
are
gone
the
summer
sun
sets
in
a
glorious
sky
a
quiet
field
all
green
and
lone
receives
its
rosy
dye
jane
sits
upon
a
shaded
stile
alone
she
sits
there
now
her
head
rests
on
her
hand
the
while
and
thought
her
brow
she
thinking
of
one
winter
day
a
few
short
months
ago
then
emma
bier
was
borne
away
wastes
of
frozen
snow
she
thinking
how
that
drifted
snow
dissolved
in
spring
first
gleam
and
how
her
sister
memory
now
fades
even
as
fades
a
dream
the
snow
will
whiten
earth
again
but
emma
comes
no
more
she
left
winter
sleet
and
rain
this
world
for
heaven
far
shore
on
beulah
hills
she
wanders
now
on
eden
tranquil
plain
to
her
shall
jane
hereafter
go
she
shall
come
to
jane
the
teacher
monologue
the
room
is
quiet
thoughts
alone
people
its
mute
tranquillity
the
yoke
put
off
the
long
task
done
i
am
as
it
is
bliss
to
be
still
and
untroubled
now
i
see
for
the
first
time
how
soft
the
day
waveless
water
stirless
tree
silent
and
sunny
wings
its
way
now
as
i
watch
that
distant
hill
so
faint
so
blue
so
far
removed
sweet
dreams
of
home
my
heart
may
fill
that
home
where
i
am
known
and
loved
it
lies
beyond
yon
azure
brow
parts
me
from
all
earth
holds
for
me
and
morn
and
eve
my
yearnings
flow
thitherward
tending
changelessly
my
happiest
hours
aye
all
the
time
i
love
to
keep
in
memory
lapsed
among
moors
ere
life
first
prime
decayed
to
dark
anxiety
sometimes
i
think
a
narrow
heart
makes
me
thus
mourn
those
far
away
and
keeps
my
love
so
far
apart
from
friends
and
friendships
of
sometimes
i
think
is
but
a
dream
i
treasure
up
so
jealously
all
the
sweet
thoughts
i
live
on
seem
to
vanish
into
vacancy
and
then
this
strange
coarse
world
around
seems
all
that
palpable
and
true
and
every
sight
and
every
sound
combines
my
spirit
to
subdue
to
aching
grief
so
void
and
lone
is
life
and
earth
so
worse
than
vain
the
hopes
that
in
my
own
heart
sown
and
cherished
by
such
sun
and
rain
as
joy
and
transient
sorrow
shed
have
ripened
to
a
harvest
there
alas
methinks
i
hear
it
said
thy
golden
sheaves
are
empty
air
all
fades
away
my
very
home
i
think
will
soon
be
desolate
i
hear
at
times
a
warning
come
of
bitter
partings
at
its
gate
and
if
i
should
return
and
see
the
quenched
the
vacant
chair
and
hear
it
whispered
mournfully
that
farewells
have
been
spoken
there
what
shall
i
do
and
whither
turn
where
look
for
peace
when
cease
to
mourn
is
not
the
air
i
wished
to
play
the
strain
i
wished
to
sing
my
wilful
spirit
slipped
away
and
struck
another
string
i
neither
wanted
smile
nor
tear
bright
joy
nor
bitter
woe
but
just
a
song
that
sweet
and
clear
though
haply
sad
might
flow
a
quiet
song
to
solace
me
when
sleep
refused
to
come
a
strain
to
chase
despondency
when
sorrowful
for
home
in
vain
i
try
i
can
not
sing
all
feels
so
cold
and
dead
no
wild
distress
no
gushing
spring
of
tears
in
anguish
shed
but
all
the
impatient
gloom
of
one
who
waits
a
distant
day
when
some
great
task
of
suffering
done
repose
shall
toil
repay
for
youth
departs
and
pleasure
flies
and
life
consumes
away
and
youth
rejoicing
ardour
dies
beneath
this
drear
delay
and
patience
weary
with
her
yoke
is
yielding
to
despair
and
health
elastic
spring
is
broke
beneath
the
strain
of
care
life
will
be
gone
ere
i
have
lived
where
now
is
life
first
prime
i
worked
and
studied
longed
and
grieved
through
all
that
rosy
time
to
toil
to
think
to
long
to
grieve
is
such
my
future
fate
the
morn
was
dreary
must
the
eve
be
also
desolate
well
such
a
life
at
least
makes
death
a
welcome
friend
then
aid
me
reason
patience
faith
to
suffer
to
the
end
passion
some
have
won
a
wild
delight
by
daring
wilder
sorrow
could
i
gain
thy
love
i
hazard
death
could
the
earn
one
kind
glance
from
thine
eye
how
this
withering
heart
would
burn
the
heady
fight
to
try
welcome
nights
of
broken
sleep
and
days
of
carnage
cold
could
i
deem
that
thou
wouldst
weep
to
hear
my
perils
told
tell
me
if
with
wandering
bands
i
roam
full
far
away
wilt
thou
to
those
distant
lands
in
spirit
ever
stray
wild
long
a
trumpet
sounds
afar
bid
me
bid
me
go
where
seik
and
briton
meet
in
war
on
indian
sutlej
flow
blood
has
dyed
the
sutlej
waves
with
scarlet
stain
i
know
indus
borders
yawn
with
graves
yet
command
me
go
though
rank
and
high
the
holocaust
of
nations
steams
to
heaven
glad
i
join
the
host
were
but
the
mandate
given
passion
strength
should
nerve
my
arm
its
ardour
stir
my
life
till
human
force
to
that
dread
charm
should
yield
and
sink
in
wild
alarm
like
trees
to
if
hot
from
war
i
seek
thy
love
darest
thou
turn
aside
darest
thou
then
my
fire
reprove
by
scorn
and
maddening
pride
no
my
will
shall
yet
control
thy
will
so
high
and
free
and
love
shall
tame
that
haughty
soul
yes
tenderest
love
for
me
i
read
my
triumph
in
thine
eyes
behold
and
prove
the
change
then
leave
perchance
my
noble
prize
once
more
in
arms
to
range
i
die
when
all
the
foam
is
up
the
bright
wine
sparkling
high
nor
wait
till
in
the
exhausted
cup
life
dull
dregs
only
lie
then
love
thus
crowned
with
sweet
reward
hope
blest
with
fulness
large
i
mount
the
saddle
draw
the
sword
and
perish
in
the
charge
preference
not
in
scorn
do
i
reprove
thee
not
in
pride
thy
vows
i
waive
but
believe
i
could
not
love
thee
wert
thou
prince
and
i
a
slave
these
then
are
thine
oaths
of
passion
this
thy
tenderness
for
me
judged
even
by
thine
own
confession
thou
art
steeped
in
perfidy
having
vanquished
thou
wouldst
leave
me
thus
i
read
thee
long
ago
therefore
dared
i
not
deceive
thee
even
with
friendship
gentle
show
therefore
with
impassive
coldness
have
i
ever
met
thy
gaze
though
full
oft
with
daring
boldness
thou
thine
eyes
to
mine
didst
raise
why
that
smile
thou
now
art
deeming
this
my
coldness
all
untrue
but
a
mask
of
frozen
seeming
hiding
secret
fires
from
view
touch
my
hand
thou
calm
for
i
am
so
does
it
burn
does
my
lip
quiver
has
mine
eye
a
troubled
glow
canst
thou
call
a
moment
colour
to
my
forehead
to
my
cheek
canst
thou
tinge
their
tranquil
pallor
with
one
flattering
feverish
streak
am
i
marble
what
no
woman
could
so
calm
before
thee
stand
nothing
living
sentient
human
could
so
coldly
take
thy
hand
yes
a
sister
might
a
mother
my
is
sisterly
dream
not
then
i
strive
to
smother
fires
that
inly
burn
for
thee
rave
not
rage
not
wrath
is
fruitless
fury
can
not
change
my
mind
i
but
deem
the
feeling
rootless
which
so
whirls
in
passion
wind
can
i
love
oh
deeply
truly
warmly
fondly
but
not
thee
and
my
love
is
answered
duly
with
an
equal
energy
wouldst
thou
see
thy
rival
hasten
draw
that
curtain
soft
aside
look
where
yon
thick
branches
chasten
noon
with
shades
of
eventide
in
that
glade
where
foliage
blending
forms
a
green
arch
overhead
sits
thy
rival
thoughtful
bending
a
stand
with
papers
spread
motionless
his
fingers
plying
that
untired
unresting
pen
time
and
tide
unnoticed
flying
there
he
sits
the
first
of
men
man
of
conscience
man
of
reason
stern
perchance
but
ever
just
foe
to
falsehood
wrong
and
treason
honour
shield
and
virtue
trust
worker
thinker
firm
defender
of
heaven
truth
man
liberty
soul
of
iron
proof
to
slander
rock
where
founders
tyranny
fame
he
seeks
not
but
full
surely
she
will
seek
him
in
his
home
this
i
know
and
wait
securely
for
the
atoning
hour
to
come
to
that
man
my
faith
is
given
therefore
soldier
cease
to
sue
while
god
reigns
in
earth
and
heaven
i
to
him
will
still
be
true
evening
solace
the
human
heart
has
hidden
treasures
in
secret
kept
in
silence
sealed
the
thoughts
the
hopes
the
dreams
the
pleasures
whose
charms
were
broken
if
revealed
and
days
may
pass
in
gay
confusion
and
nights
in
rosy
riot
fly
while
lost
in
fame
or
wealth
illusion
the
memory
of
the
past
may
die
but
there
are
hours
of
lonely
musing
such
as
in
evening
silence
come
when
soft
as
birds
their
pinions
closing
the
heart
best
feelings
gather
home
then
in
our
souls
there
seems
to
languish
a
tender
grief
that
is
not
woe
and
thoughts
that
once
wrung
groans
of
anguish
now
cause
but
some
mild
tears
to
flow
and
feelings
once
as
strong
as
passions
float
softly
back
a
faded
dream
our
own
sharp
griefs
and
wild
sensations
the
tale
of
others
sufferings
seem
oh
when
the
heart
is
freshly
bleeding
how
longs
it
for
that
time
to
be
when
through
the
mist
of
years
receding
its
woes
but
live
in
reverie
and
it
can
dwell
on
moonlight
glimmer
on
evening
shade
and
loneliness
and
while
the
sky
grows
dim
and
dimmer
feel
no
untold
and
strange
distress
only
a
deeper
impulse
given
by
lonely
hour
and
darkened
room
to
solemn
thoughts
that
soar
to
heaven
seeking
a
life
and
world
to
come
stanzas
if
thou
be
in
a
lonely
place
if
one
hour
calm
be
thine
as
evening
bends
her
placid
face
this
sweet
day
decline
if
all
the
earth
and
all
the
heaven
now
look
serene
to
thee
as
them
shuts
the
summer
even
one
moment
think
of
me
pause
in
the
lane
returning
home
is
dusk
it
will
be
still
pause
near
the
elm
a
sacred
gloom
its
breezeless
boughs
will
fill
look
at
that
soft
and
golden
light
high
in
the
unclouded
sky
watch
the
last
bird
belated
flight
as
it
flits
silent
by
hark
for
a
sound
upon
the
wind
a
step
a
voice
a
sigh
if
all
be
still
then
yield
thy
mind
unchecked
to
memory
if
thy
love
were
like
mine
how
blest
that
twilight
hour
would
seem
when
back
from
the
regretted
past
returned
our
early
dream
if
thy
love
were
like
mine
how
wild
thy
longings
even
to
pain
for
sunset
soft
and
moonlight
mild
to
bring
that
hour
again
but
oft
when
in
thine
arms
i
lay
i
seen
thy
dark
eyes
shine
and
deeply
felt
their
changeful
ray
spoke
other
love
than
mine
my
love
is
almost
anguish
now
it
beats
so
strong
and
true
rapture
could
i
deem
that
thou
such
anguish
ever
knew
i
have
been
but
thy
transient
flower
thou
wert
my
god
divine
till
checked
by
death
congealing
power
this
heart
must
throb
for
thine
and
well
my
dying
hour
were
blest
if
life
expiring
breath
should
pass
as
thy
lips
gently
prest
my
forehead
cold
in
death
and
sound
my
sleep
would
be
and
sweet
beneath
the
churchyard
tree
if
sometimes
in
thy
heart
should
beat
one
pulse
still
true
to
me
parting
there
no
use
in
weeping
though
we
are
condemned
to
part
there
such
a
thing
as
keeping
a
remembrance
in
one
heart
there
such
a
thing
as
dwelling
on
the
thought
ourselves
have
nursed
and
with
scorn
and
courage
telling
the
world
to
do
its
worst
we
not
let
its
follies
grieve
us
we
just
take
them
as
they
come
and
then
every
day
will
leave
us
a
merry
laugh
for
home
when
we
left
each
friend
and
brother
when
we
parted
wide
and
far
we
will
think
of
one
another
as
even
better
than
we
are
every
glorious
sight
above
us
every
pleasant
sight
beneath
we
connect
with
those
that
love
us
whom
we
truly
love
till
death
in
the
evening
when
we
sitting
by
the
fire
perchance
alone
then
shall
heart
with
warm
heart
meeting
give
responsive
tone
for
tone
we
can
burst
the
bonds
which
chain
us
which
cold
human
hands
have
wrought
and
where
none
shall
dare
restrain
us
we
can
meet
again
in
thought
so
there
no
use
in
weeping
bear
a
cheerful
spirit
still
never
doubt
that
fate
is
keeping
future
good
for
present
ill
apostasy
this
last
denial
of
my
faith
thou
solemn
priest
hast
heard
and
though
upon
my
bed
of
death
i
call
not
back
a
word
point
not
to
thy
madonna
priest
thy
sightless
saint
of
stone
she
can
not
from
this
burning
breast
wring
one
repentant
moan
thou
that
when
a
sinless
child
i
duly
bent
the
knee
and
prayed
to
what
in
marble
smiled
cold
lifeless
mute
on
me
i
did
but
listen
children
spring
full
soon
to
riper
youth
and
for
love
vow
and
wedlock
ring
i
sold
my
early
truth
was
not
a
grey
bare
head
like
thine
bent
me
when
i
said
that
land
and
god
and
faith
are
mine
for
which
thy
fathers
bled
i
see
thee
not
my
eyes
are
dim
but
well
i
hear
thee
say
o
daughter
cease
to
think
of
him
who
led
thy
soul
astray
between
you
lies
both
space
and
time
let
leagues
and
years
prevail
to
turn
thee
from
the
path
of
crime
back
to
the
church
pale
and
did
i
need
that
thou
shouldst
tell
what
mighty
barriers
rise
to
part
me
from
that
where
my
loved
walter
lies
and
did
i
need
that
thou
shouldst
taunt
my
dying
hour
at
last
by
bidding
this
worn
spirit
pant
no
more
for
what
is
past
priest
must
i
cease
to
think
of
him
how
hollow
rings
that
word
can
time
can
tears
can
distance
dim
the
memory
of
my
lord
i
said
before
i
saw
not
thee
because
an
hour
agone
over
my
eyeballs
heavily
the
lids
fell
down
like
stone
but
still
my
spirit
inward
sight
beholds
his
image
beam
as
fixed
as
clear
as
burning
bright
as
some
red
planet
gleam
talk
not
of
thy
last
sacrament
tell
not
thy
beads
for
me
both
rite
and
prayer
are
vainly
spent
as
dews
upon
the
sea
speak
not
one
word
of
heaven
above
rave
not
of
hell
alarms
give
me
but
back
my
walter
love
restore
me
to
his
arms
then
will
the
bliss
of
heaven
be
won
then
will
hell
shrink
away
as
i
have
seen
night
terrors
shun
the
conquering
steps
of
day
is
my
religion
thus
to
love
my
creed
thus
fixed
to
be
not
death
shall
shake
nor
priestcraft
break
my
constancy
now
go
for
at
the
door
there
waits
another
stranger
guest
he
calls
i
come
my
pulse
scarce
beats
my
heart
fails
in
my
breast
again
that
voice
how
far
away
how
dreary
sounds
that
tone
and
i
methinks
am
gone
astray
in
trackless
wastes
and
lone
i
fain
would
rest
a
little
while
where
can
i
find
a
stay
till
dawn
upon
the
hills
shall
smile
and
show
some
trodden
way
i
come
i
come
in
haste
she
said
was
walter
voice
i
heard
then
up
she
sprang
but
fell
back
dead
his
name
her
latest
word
winter
stores
we
take
from
life
one
little
share
and
say
that
this
shall
be
a
space
redeemed
from
toil
and
care
from
tears
and
sadness
free
and
haply
death
unstrings
his
bow
and
sorrow
stands
apart
and
for
a
little
while
we
know
the
sunshine
of
the
heart
existence
seems
a
summer
eve
warm
soft
and
full
of
peace
our
free
unfettered
feelings
give
the
soul
its
full
release
a
moment
then
it
takes
the
power
to
call
up
thoughts
that
throw
around
that
charmed
and
hallowed
hour
this
life
divinest
glow
but
time
though
viewlessly
it
flies
and
slowly
will
not
stay
alike
through
clear
and
clouded
skies
it
cleaves
its
silent
way
alike
the
bitter
cup
of
grief
alike
the
draught
of
bliss
its
progress
leaves
but
moment
brief
for
baffled
lips
to
kiss
the
sparkling
draught
is
dried
away
the
hour
of
rest
is
gone
and
urgent
voices
round
us
say
ho
lingerer
hasten
on
and
has
the
soul
then
only
gained
from
this
brief
time
of
ease
a
moment
rest
when
overstrained
one
hurried
glimpse
of
peace
no
while
the
sun
shone
kindly
us
and
flowers
bloomed
round
our
feet
while
many
a
bud
of
joy
before
us
unclosed
its
petals
sweet
an
unseen
work
within
was
plying
like
bee
from
flower
to
flower
unwearied
flying
laboured
one
faculty
thoughtful
for
winter
future
sorrow
its
gloom
and
scarcity
prescient
of
want
toiled
quiet
memory
is
she
that
from
each
transient
pleasure
extracts
a
lasting
good
is
she
that
finds
in
summer
treasure
to
serve
for
winter
food
and
when
youth
summer

is
vanished
and

brings
winter
stress
her

guardian

must
again
then
firmly
face
that
task

anguish
to

a
conflict
wild
and
long
and
fierce
the
war
will
be
ere
duty
both
has
reconciled
what
other
tie
yet
holds
me
fast
to
the
divorced
abandoned
past
smouldering
on
my
heart
altar
lies
the
fire
of
some
great
sacrifice
not
yet
half
quenched
the
sacred
steel
but
lately
struck
my
carnal
will
my
hope
first
joy
and
last
what
i
loved
well
and
clung
to
fast
what
i
wished
wildly
to
retain
what
i
renounced
with
pain
what
when
i
saw
it
perish
left
me
no
joy
on
earth
to
cherish
a
man
bereft
yet
sternly
now
i
do
confirm
that
jephtha
vow
shall
i
retract
or
fear
or
flee
did
christ
when
rose
the
fatal
tree
before
him
on
mount
calvary
was
a
long
fight
hard
fought
but
won
and
what
i
did
was
justly
done
yet
helen
from
thy
love
i
turned
when
my
heart
most
for
thy
heart
burned
i
dared
thy
tears
i
dared
thy
scorn
easier
the
had
been
borne
helen
thou
mightst
not
go
with
me
i
could
not
dared
not
stay
for
thee
i
heard
afar
in
bonds
complain
the
savage
from
beyond
the
main
and
that
wild
sound
rose
the
cry
wrung
out
by
passion
agony
and
even
when
with
the
bitterest
tear
i
ever
shed
mine
eyes
were
dim
still
with
the
spirit
vision
clear
i
saw
hell
empire
vast
and
grim
spread
on
each
indian
river
shore
each
realm
of
asia
covering
there
the
weak
trampled
by
the
strong
live
but
to
suffer
hopeless
die
there
whose
creed
is
wrong
extortion
lust
and
cruelty
crush
our
lost
race
and
brimming
fill
the
bitter
cup
of
human
ill
and
i
who
have
the
healing
creed
the
faith
benign
of
mary
son
shall
i
behold
my
brother
need
and
selfishly
to
aid
him
shun
i
who
upon
my
mother
knees
in
childhood
read
christ
written
word
received
his
legacy
of
peace
his
holy
rule
of
action
heard
i
in
whose
heart
the
sacred
sense
of
jesus
love
was
early
felt
of
his
pure
full
benevolence
his
pitying
tenderness
for
guilt
his
for
wandering
sheep
for
all
weak
sorrowing
trembling
things
his
mercy
vast
his
passion
deep
of
anguish
for
man
sufferings
i
schooled
from
childhood
in
such
lore
dared
i
draw
back
or
hesitate
when
called
to
heal
the
sickness
sore
of
those
far
off
and
desolate
dark
in
the
realm
and
shades
of
death
nations
and
tribes
and
empires
lie
but
even
to
them
the
light
of
faith
is
breaking
on
their
sombre
sky
and
be
it
mine
to
bid
them
raise
their
drooped
heads
to
the
kindling
scene
and
know
and
hail
the
sunrise
blaze
which
heralds
christ
the
nazarene
i
know
how
hell
the
veil
will
spread
over
their
brows
and
filmy
eyes
and
earthward
crush
the
lifted
head
that
would
look
up
and
seek
the
skies
i
know
what
war
the
fiend
will
wage
against
that
soldier
of
the
cross
who
comes
to
dare
his
demon
rage
and
work
his
kingdom
shame
and
loss
yes
hard
and
terrible
the
toil
of
him
who
steps
on
foreign
soil
resolved
to
plant
the
gospel
vine
where
tyrants
rule
and
slaves
repine
eager
to
lift
religion
light
where
thickest
shades
of
mental
night
screen
the
false
god
and
fiendish
rite
reckless
that
missionary
blood
shed
in
wild
wilderness
and
wood
has
left
upon
the
unblest
air
the
man
deep
moan
the
martyr
prayer
i
know
my
lot
i
only
ask
power
to
fulfil
the
glorious
task
willing
the
spirit
may
the
flesh
strength
for
the
day
receive
afresh
may
burning
sun
or
deadly
wind
prevail
not
an
earnest
mind
may
torments
strange
or
direst
death
nor
trample
truth
nor
baffle
faith
though
such
should
fall
from
me
as
fell
in
old
gethsemane
welcome
the
anguish
so
it
gave
more
strength
to
work
more
skill
to
save
and
oh
if
brief
must
be
my
time
if
hostile
hand
or
fatal
clime
cut
short
my
course
still
my
grave
lord
may
thy
harvest
whitening
wave
so
i
the
culture
may
begin
let
others
thrust
the
sickle
in
if
but
the
seed
will
faster
grow
may
my
blood
water
what
i
sow
what
have
i
ever
trembling
stood
and
feared
to
give
to
god
that
blood
what
has
the
coward
love
of
life
made
me
shrink
from
the
righteous
strife
have
human
passions
human
fears
severed
me
from
those
pioneers
whose
task
is
to
march
first
and
trace
paths
for
the
progress
of
our
race
it
has
been
so
but
grant
me
lord
now
to
stand
steadfast
by
thy
word
protected
by
salvation
helm
shielded
by
faith
with
truth
begirt
to
smile
when
trials
seek
to
whelm
and
stand
mid
testing
fires
unhurt
hurling
hell
strongest
bulwarks
down
even
when
the
last
pang
thrills
my
breast
when
death
bestows
the
martyr
crown
and
calls
me
into
jesus
rest
then
for
my
ultimate
reward
then
for
the
word
the
voice
from
father
spirit
son
servant
of
god
well
hast
thou
done
poems
by
ellis
bell
faith
and
despondency
the
winter
wind
is
loud
and
wild
come
close
to
me
my
darling
child
forsake
thy
books
and
mateless
play
and
while
the
night
is
gathering
gray
we
talk
its
pensive
hours
away
ierne
round
our
sheltered
hall
november
gusts
unheeded
call
not
one
faint
breath
can
enter
here
enough
to
wave
my
daughter
hair
and
i
am
glad
to
watch
the
blaze
glance
from
her
eyes
with
mimic
rays
to
feel
her
cheek
so
softly
pressed
in
happy
quiet
on
my
breast
but
yet
even
this
tranquillity
brings
bitter
restless
thoughts
to
me
and
in
the
red
fire
cheerful
glow
i
think
of
deep
glens
blocked
with
snow
i
dream
of
moor
and
misty
hill
where
evening
closes
dark
and
chill
for
lone
among
the
mountains
cold
lie
those
that
i
have
loved
of
old
and
my
heart
aches
in
hopeless
pain
exhausted
with
repinings
vain
that
i
shall
greet
them
again
father
in
early
infancy
when
you
were
far
beyond
the
sea
such
thoughts
were
tyrants
over
me
i
often
sat
for
hours
together
through
the
long
nights
of
angry
weather
raised
on
my
pillow
to
descry
the
dim
moon
struggling
in
the
sky
or
with
strained
ear
to
catch
the
shock
of
rock
with
wave
and
wave
with
rock
so
would
i
fearful
vigil
keep
and
all
for
listening
never
sleep
but
this
world
life
has
much
to
dread
not
so
my
father
with
the
dead
oh
not
for
them
should
we
despair
the
grave
is
drear
but
they
are
not
there
their
dust
is
mingled
with
the
sod
their
happy
souls
are
gone
to
god
you
told
me
this
and
yet
you
sigh
and
murmur
that
your
friends
must
die
ah
my
dear
father
tell
me
why
for
if
your
former
words
were
true
how
useless
would
such
sorrow
be
as
wise
to
mourn
the
seed
which
grew
unnoticed
on
its
parent
tree
because
it
fell
in
fertile
earth
and
sprang
up
to
a
glorious
birth
struck
deep
its
root
and
lifted
high
its
green
boughs
in
the
breezy
sky
but
i
not
fear
i
will
not
weep
for
those
whose
bodies
rest
in
sleep
i
know
there
is
a
blessed
shore
opening
its
ports
for
me
and
mine
and
gazing
time
wide
waters
i
weary
for
that
land
divine
where
we
were
born
where
you
and
i
shall
meet
our
dearest
when
we
die
from
suffering
and
corruption
free
restored
into
the
deity
well
hast
thou
spoken
sweet
trustful
child
and
wiser
than
thy
sire
and
worldly
tempests
raging
wild
shall
strengthen
thy
desire
thy
fervent
hope
through
storm
and
foam
through
wind
and
ocean
roar
to
reach
at
last
the
eternal
home
the
steadfast
changeless
shore
stars
ah
why
because
the
dazzling
sun
restored
our
earth
to
joy
have
you
departed
every
one
and
left
a
desert
sky
all
through
the
night
your
glorious
eyes
were
gazing
down
in
mine
and
with
a
full
heart
thankful
sighs
i
blessed
that
watch
divine
i
was
at
peace
and
drank
your
beams
as
they
were
life
to
me
and
revelled
in
my
changeful
dreams
like
petrel
on
the
sea
thought
followed
thought
star
followed
star
through
boundless
regions
on
while
one
sweet
influence
near
and
far
thrilled
through
and
proved
us
one
why
did
the
morning
dawn
to
break
so
great
so
pure
a
spell
and
scorch
with
fire
the
tranquil
cheek
where
your
cool
radiance
fell
he
rose
and
his
fierce
beams
struck
my
brow
the
soul
of
nature
sprang
elate
but
mine
sank
sad
and
low
my
lids
closed
down
yet
through
their
veil
i
saw
him
blazing
still
and
steep
in
gold
the
misty
dale
and
flash
upon
the
hill
i
turned
me
to
the
pillow
then
to
call
back
night
and
see
your
worlds
of
solemn
light
again
throb
with
my
heart
and
me
it
would
not
do
the
pillow
glowed
and
glowed
both
roof
and
floor
and
birds
sang
loudly
in
the
wood
and
fresh
winds
shook
the
door
the
curtains
waved
the
wakened
flies
were
murmuring
round
my
room
imprisoned
there
till
i
should
rise
and
give
them
leave
to
roam
oh
stars
and
dreams
and
gentle
night
oh
night
and
stars
return
and
hide
me
from
the
hostile
light
that
does
not
warm
but
burn
that
drains
the
blood
of
suffering
men
drinks
tears
instead
of
dew
let
me
sleep
through
his
blinding
reign
and
only
wake
with
you
the
philosopher
enough
of
thought
philosopher
too
long
hast
thou
been
dreaming
unlightened
in
this
chamber
drear
while
summer
sun
is
beaming
soul
what
sad
refrain
concludes
thy
musings
once
again
oh
for
the
time
when
i
shall
sleep
without
identity
and
never
care
how
rain
may
steep
or
snow
may
cover
me
no
promised
heaven
these
wild
desires
could
all
or
half
fulfil
no
threatened
hell
with
quenchless
fires
subdue
this
quenchless
will
so
said
i
and
still
say
the
same
still
to
my
death
will
say
three
gods
within
this
little
frame
are
warring
night
and
day
heaven
could
not
hold
them
all
and
yet
they
all
are
held
in
me
and
must
be
mine
till
i
forget
my
present
entity
oh
for
the
time
when
in
my
breast
their
struggles
will
be
oh
for
the
day
when
i
shall
rest
and
never
suffer
more
i
saw
a
spirit
standing
man
where
thou
dost
stand
an
hour
ago
and
round
his
feet
three
rivers
ran
of
equal
depth
and
equal
flow
a
golden
stream
and
one
like
blood
and
one
like
sapphire
seemed
to
be
but
where
they
joined
their
triple
flood
it
tumbled
in
an
inky
sea
the
spirit
sent
his
dazzling
gaze
down
through
that
ocean
gloomy
night
then
kindling
all
with
sudden
blaze
the
glad
deep
sparkled
wide
and
bright
white
as
the
sun
far
far
more
fair
than
its
divided
sources
were
and
even
for
that
spirit
seer
i
watched
and
sought
my
long
sought
him
in
heaven
hell
earth
and
air
an
endless
search
and
always
wrong
had
i
but
seen
his
glorious
eye
once
light
the
clouds
that
wilder
me
i
had
raised
this
coward
cry
to
cease
to
think
and
cease
to
be
i
had
called
oblivion
blest
nor
stretching
eager
hands
to
death
implored
to
change
for
senseless
rest
this
sentient
soul
this
living
breath
oh
let
me
die
that
power
and
will
their
cruel
strife
may
close
and
conquered
good
and
conquering
ill
be
lost
in
one
repose
remembrance
cold
in
the
earth
and
the
deep
snow
piled
above
thee
far
far
removed
cold
in
the
dreary
grave
have
i
forgot
my
only
love
to
love
thee
severed
at
last
by
time
wave
now
when
alone
do
my
thoughts
no
longer
hover
over
the
mountains
on
that
northern
shore
resting
their
wings
where
heath
and
cover
thy
noble
heart
for
ever
ever
more
cold
in
the
earth
and
fifteen
wild
decembers
from
those
brown
hills
have
melted
into
spring
faithful
indeed
is
the
spirit
that
remembers
after
such
years
of
change
and
suffering
sweet
love
of
youth
forgive
if
i
forget
thee
while
the
world
tide
is
bearing
me
along
other
desires
and
other
hopes
beset
me
hopes
which
obscure
but
can
not
do
thee
wrong
no
later
light
has
lightened
up
my
heaven
no
second
morn
has
ever
shone
for
me
all
my
life
bliss
from
thy
dear
life
was
given
all
my
life
bliss
is
in
the
grave
with
thee
but
when
the
days
of
golden
dreams
had
perished
and
even
despair
was
powerless
to
destroy
then
did
i
learn
how
existence
could
be
cherished
strengthened
and
fed
without
the
aid
of
joy
then
did
i
check
the
tears
of
useless
passion
weaned
my
young
soul
from
yearning
after
thine
sternly
denied
its
burning
wish
to
hasten
down
to
that
tomb
already
more
than
mine
and
even
yet
i
dare
not
let
it
languish
dare
not
indulge
in
memory
rapturous
pain
once
drinking
deep
of
that
divinest
anguish
how
could
i
seek
the
empty
world
again
a
o
day
he
can
not
die
when
thou
so
fair
art
shining
o
sun
in
such
a
glorious
sky
so
tranquilly
declining
he
can
not
leave
thee
now
while
fresh
west
winds
are
blowing
and
all
around
his
youthful
brow
thy
cheerful
light
is
glowing
edward
awake
awake
the
golden
evening
gleams
warm
and
bright
on
arden
lake
arouse
thee
from
thy
dreams
beside
thee
on
my
knee
my
dearest
friend
i
pray
that
thou
to
cross
the
eternal
sea
wouldst
yet
one
hour
delay
i
hear
its
billows
roar
i
see
them
foaming
high
but
no
glimpse
of
a
further
shore
has
blest
my
straining
eye
believe
not
what
they
urge
of
eden
isles
beyond
turn
back
from
that
tempestuous
surge
to
thy
own
native
land
it
is
not
death
but
pain
that
struggles
in
thy
breast
nay
rally
edward
rouse
again
i
can
not
let
thee
rest
one
long
look
that
sore
reproved
me
for
the
woe
i
could
not
bear
one
mute
look
of
suffering
moved
me
to
repent
my
useless
prayer
and
with
sudden
check
the
heaving
of
distraction
passed
away
not
a
sign
of
further
grieving
stirred
my
soul
that
awful
day
paled
at
length
the
sweet
sun
setting
sunk
to
peace
the
twilight
breeze
summer
dews
fell
softly
wetting
glen
and
glade
and
silent
trees
then
his
eyes
began
to
weary
weighed
beneath
a
mortal
sleep
and
their
orbs
grew
strangely
dreary
clouded
even
as
they
would
weep
but
they
wept
not
but
they
changed
not
never
moved
and
never
closed
troubled
still
and
still
they
ranged
not
wandered
not
nor
yet
reposed
so
i
knew
that
he
was
dying
stooped
and
raised
his
languid
head
felt
no
breath
and
heard
no
sighing
so
i
knew
that
he
was
dead
song
the
linnet
in
the
rocky
dells
the
in
the
air
the
bee
among
the
heather
bells
that
hide
my
lady
fair
the
wild
deer
browse
above
her
breast
the
wild
birds
raise
their
brood
and
they
her
smiles
of
love
caressed
have
left
her
solitude
i
ween
that
when
the
grave
dark
wall
did
first
her
form
retain
they
thought
their
hearts
could
recall
the
light
of
joy
again
they
thought
the
tide
of
grief
would
flow
unchecked
through
future
years
but
where
is
all
their
anguish
now
and
where
are
all
their
tears
well
let
them
fight
for
honour
breath
or
pleasure
shade
pursue
the
dweller
in
the
land
of
death
is
changed
and
careless
too
and
if
their
eyes
should
watch
and
weep
till
sorrow
source
were
dry
she
would
not
in
her
tranquil
sleep
return
a
single
sigh
blow
by
the
lonely
mound
and
murmur
there
is
no
need
of
other
sound
to
soothe
my
lady
dreams
anticipation
how
beautiful
the
earth
is
still
to
thee
how
full
of
happiness
how
little
fraught
with
real
ill
or
unreal
phantoms
of
distress
how
spring
can
bring
thee
glory
yet
and
summer
win
thee
to
forget
december
sullen
time
why
dost
thou
hold
the
treasure
fast
of
youth
delight
when
youth
is
past
and
thou
art
near
thy
prime
when
those
who
were
thy
own
compeers
equals
in
fortune
and
in
years
have
seen
their
morning
melt
in
tears
to
clouded
smileless
day
blest
had
they
died
untried
and
young
before
their
hearts
went
wandering
wrong
poor
slaves
subdued
by
passions
strong
a
weak
and
helpless
prey
i
hoped
while
they
enjoyed
and
by
fulfilment
hope
destroyed
as
children
hope
with
trustful
breast
i
waited
bliss
and
cherished
rest
a
thoughtful
spirit
taught
me
soon
that
we
must
long
till
life
be
done
that
every
phase
of
earthly
joy
must
always
fade
and
always
cloy
i
foresaw
and
would
not
chase
the
fleeting
treacheries
but
with
firm
foot
and
tranquil
face
held
backward
from
that
tempting
race
gazed
the
sands
the
waves
efface
to
the
enduring
seas
there
cast
my
anchor
of
desire
deep
in
unknown
eternity
nor
ever
let
my
spirit
tire
with
looking
for
what
is
to
be
it
is
hope
spell
that
glorifies
like
youth
to
my
maturer
eyes
all
nature
million
mysteries
the
fearful
and
the
fair
hope
soothes
me
in
the
griefs
i
know
she
lulls
my
pain
for
others
woe
and
makes
me
strong
to
undergo
what
i
am
born
to
bear
glad
comforter
will
i
not
brave
unawed
the
darkness
of
the
grave
nay
smile
to
hear
death
billows
rave
sustained
my
guide
by
thee
the
more
unjust
seems
present
fate
the
more
my
spirit
swells
elate
strong
in
thy
strength
to
anticipate
rewarding
destiny
the
prisoner
a
fragment
in
the
idly
did
i
stray
reckless
of
the
lives
wasting
there
away
draw
the
ponderous
bars
open
warder
stern
he
dared
not
say
me
nay
the
hinges
harshly
turn
our
guests
are
darkly
lodged
i
whisper
gazing
through
the
vault
whose
grated
eye
showed
heaven
more
gray
than
blue
this
was
when
glad
spring
laughed
in
awaking
pride
ay
darkly
lodged
enough
returned
my
sullen
guide
then
god
forgive
my
youth
forgive
my
careless
tongue
i
scoffed
as
the
chill
chains
on
the
damp
flagstones
rung
confined
in
triple
walls
art
thou
so
much
to
fear
that
we
must
bind
thee
down
and
clench
thy
fetters
here
the
captive
raised
her
face
it
was
as
soft
and
mild
as
sculptured
marble
saint
or
slumbering
unwean
child
it
was
so
soft
and
mild
it
was
so
sweet
and
fair
pain
could
not
trace
a
line
nor
grief
a
shadow
there
the
captive
raised
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
her
brow
i
have
been
struck
she
said
and
i
am
suffering
now
yet
these
are
little
worth
your
bolts
and
irons
strong
and
were
they
forged
in
steel
they
could
not
hold
me
long
hoarse
laughed
the
jailor
grim
shall
i
be
won
to
hear
dost
think
fond
dreaming
wretch
that
i
shall
grant
thy
prayer
or
better
still
wilt
melt
my
master
heart
with
groans
ah
sooner
might
the
sun
thaw
down
these
granite
stones
my
master
voice
is
low
his
aspect
bland
and
kind
but
hard
as
hardest
flint
the
soul
that
lurks
behind
and
i
am
rough
and
rude
yet
not
more
rough
to
see
than
is
the
hidden
ghost
that
has
its
home
in
me
about
her
lips
there
played
a
smile
of
almost
scorn
my
friend
she
gently
said
you
have
not
heard
me
mourn
when
you
my
kindred
lives
my
lost
life
can
restore
then
may
i
weep
and
sue
but
never
friend
before
still
let
my
tyrants
know
i
am
not
doomed
to
wear
year
after
year
in
gloom
and
desolate
despair
a
messenger
of
hope
comes
every
night
to
me
and
offers
for
short
life
eternal
liberty
he
comes
with
western
winds
with
evening
wandering
airs
with
that
clear
dusk
of
heaven
that
brings
the
thickest
stars
winds
take
a
pensive
tone
and
stars
a
tender
fire
and
visions
rise
and
change
that
kill
me
with
desire
desire
for
nothing
known
in
my
maturer
years
when
joy
grew
mad
with
awe
at
counting
future
tears
when
if
my
spirit
sky
was
full
of
flashes
warm
i
knew
not
whence
they
came
from
sun
or
but
first
a
hush
of
peace
a
soundless
calm
descends
the
struggle
of
distress
and
fierce
impatience
ends
mute
music
soothes
my
breast
unuttered
harmony
that
i
could
never
dream
till
earth
was
lost
to
me
then
dawns
the
invisible
the
unseen
its
truth
reveals
my
outward
sense
is
gone
my
inward
essence
feels
its
wings
are
almost
free
its
home
its
harbour
found
measuring
the
gulph
it
stoops
and
dares
the
final
bound
oh
i
dreadful
is
the
check
intense
the
agony
when
the
ear
begins
to
hear
and
the
eye
begins
to
see
when
the
pulse
begins
to
throb
the
brain
to
think
again
the
soul
to
feel
the
flesh
and
the
flesh
to
feel
the
chain
yet
i
would
lose
no
sting
would
wish
no
torture
less
the
more
that
anguish
racks
the
earlier
it
will
bless
and
robed
in
fires
of
hell
or
bright
with
heavenly
shine
if
it
but
herald
death
the
vision
is
divine
she
ceased
to
speak
and
we
unanswering
turned
to
go
we
had
no
further
power
to
work
the
captive
woe
her
cheek
her
gleaming
eye
declared
that
man
had
given
a
sentence
unapproved
and
overruled
by
heaven
hope
hope
was
but
a
timid
friend
she
sat
without
the
grated
den
watching
how
my
fate
would
tend
even
as
men
she
was
cruel
in
her
fear
through
the
bars
one
dreary
day
i
looked
out
to
see
her
there
and
she
turned
her
face
away
like
a
false
guard
false
watch
keeping
still
in
strife
she
whispered
peace
she
would
sing
while
i
was
weeping
if
i
listened
she
would
cease
false
she
was
and
unrelenting
when
my
last
joys
strewed
the
ground
even
sorrow
saw
repenting
those
sad
relics
scattered
round
hope
whose
whisper
would
have
given
balm
to
all
my
frenzied
pain
stretched
her
wings
and
soared
to
heaven
went
and
returned
again
a
day
dream
on
a
sunny
brae
alone
i
lay
one
summer
afternoon
it
was
the
of
may
with
her
young
lover
june
from
her
mother
heart
seemed
loath
to
part
that
queen
of
bridal
charms
but
her
father
smiled
on
the
fairest
child
he
ever
held
in
his
arms
the
trees
did
wave
their
plumy
crests
the
glad
birds
carolled
clear
and
i
of
all
the
wedding
guests
was
only
sullen
there
there
was
not
one
but
wished
to
shun
my
aspect
void
of
cheer
the
very
gray
rocks
looking
on
asked
what
do
you
here
and
i
could
utter
no
reply
in
sooth
i
did
not
know
why
i
had
brought
a
clouded
eye
to
greet
the
general
glow
so
resting
on
a
heathy
bank
i
took
my
heart
to
me
and
we
together
sadly
sank
into
a
reverie
we
thought
when
winter
comes
again
where
will
these
bright
things
be
all
vanished
like
a
vision
vain
an
unreal
mockery
the
birds
that
now
so
blithely
sing
through
deserts
frozen
dry
poor
spectres
of
the
perished
spring
in
famished
troops
will
fly
and
why
should
we
be
glad
at
all
the
leaf
is
hardly
green
before
a
token
of
its
fall
is
on
the
surface
seen
now
whether
it
were
really
so
i
never
could
be
sure
but
as
in
fit
of
peevish
woe
i
stretched
me
on
the
moor
a
thousand
thousand
gleaming
fires
seemed
kindling
in
the
air
a
thousand
thousand
silvery
lyres
resounded
far
and
near
methought
the
very
breath
i
breathed
was
full
of
sparks
divine
and
all
my
was
wreathed
by
that
celestial
shine
and
while
the
wide
earth
echoing
rung
to
that
strange
minstrelsy
the
little
glittering
spirits
sung
or
seemed
to
sing
to
me
o
mortal
mortal
let
them
die
let
time
and
tears
destroy
that
we
may
overflow
the
sky
with
universal
joy
let
grief
distract
the
sufferer
breast
and
night
obscure
his
way
they
hasten
him
to
endless
rest
and
everlasting
day
to
thee
the
world
is
like
a
tomb
a
desert
naked
shore
to
us
in
unimagined
bloom
it
brightens
more
and
more
and
could
we
lift
the
veil
and
give
one
brief
glimpse
to
thine
eye
thou
wouldst
rejoice
for
those
that
live
because
they
live
to
die
the
music
ceased
the
noonday
dream
like
dream
of
night
withdrew
but
fancy
still
will
sometimes
deem
her
fond
creation
true
to
imagination
when
weary
with
the
long
day
care
and
earthly
change
from
pain
to
pain
and
lost
and
ready
to
despair
thy
kind
voice
calls
me
back
again
oh
my
true
friend
i
am
not
lone
while
then
canst
speak
with
such
a
tone
so
hopeless
is
the
world
without
the
world
within
i
doubly
prize
thy
world
where
guile
and
hate
and
doubt
and
cold
suspicion
never
rise
where
thou
and
i
and
liberty
have
undisputed
sovereignty
what
matters
it
that
all
around
danger
and
guilt
and
darkness
lie
if
but
within
our
bosom
bound
we
hold
a
bright
untroubled
sky
warm
with
ten
thousand
mingled
rays
of
suns
that
know
no
winter
days
reason
indeed
may
oft
complain
for
nature
sad
reality
and
tell
the
suffering
heart
how
vain
its
cherished
dreams
must
always
be
and
truth
may
rudely
trample
down
the
flowers
of
fancy
but
thou
art
ever
there
to
bring
the
hovering
vision
back
and
breathe
new
glories
the
blighted
spring
and
call
a
lovelier
life
from
death
and
whisper
with
a
voice
divine
of
real
worlds
as
bright
as
thine
i
trust
not
to
thy
phantom
bliss
yet
still
in
evening
quiet
hour
with
thankfulness
i
welcome
thee
benignant
power
sure
solacer
of
human
cares
and
sweeter
hope
when
hope
despairs
how
clear
she
shines
how
clear
she
shines
how
quietly
i
lie
beneath
her
guardian
light
while
heaven
and
earth
are
whispering
me
to
morrow
wake
but
dream
yes
fancy
come
my
fairy
love
these
throbbing
temples
softly
kiss
and
bend
my
lonely
couch
above
and
bring
me
rest
and
bring
me
bliss
the
world
is
going
dark
world
adieu
grim
world
conceal
thee
till
the
day
the
heart
thou
canst
not
all
subdue
must
still
resist
if
thou
delay
thy
love
i
will
not
will
not
share
thy
hatred
only
wakes
a
smile
thy
griefs
may
wound
thy
wrongs
may
tear
but
oh
thy
lies
shall
beguile
while
gazing
on
the
stars
that
glow
above
me
in
that
stormless
sea
i
long
to
hope
that
all
the
woe
creation
knows
is
held
in
thee
and
this
shall
be
my
dream
i
think
the
heaven
of
glorious
spheres
is
rolling
on
its
course
of
light
in
endless
bliss
through
endless
years
i
think
there
not
one
world
above
far
as
these
straining
eyes
can
see
where
wisdom
ever
laughed
at
love
or
virtue
crouched
to
infamy
where
writhing
the
strokes
of
fate
the
mangled
wretch
was
forced
to
smile
to
match
his
patience
her
hate
his
heart
rebellious
all
the
while
where
pleasure
still
will
lead
to
wrong
and
helpless
reason
warn
in
vain
and
truth
is
weak
and
treachery
strong
and
joy
the
surest
path
to
pain
and
peace
the
lethargy
of
grief
and
hope
a
phantom
of
the
soul
and
life
a
labour
void
and
brief
and
death
the
despot
of
the
whole
sympathy
there
should
be
no
despair
for
you
while
nightly
stars
are
burning
while
evening
pours
its
silent
dew
and
sunshine
gilds
the
morning
there
should
be
no
despair
though
tears
may
flow
down
like
a
river
are
not
the
best
beloved
of
years
around
your
heart
for
ever
they
weep
you
weep
it
must
be
so
winds
sigh
as
you
are
sighing
and
winter
sheds
its
grief
in
snow
where
autumn
leaves
are
lying
yet
these
revive
and
from
their
fate
your
fate
can
not
be
parted
then
journey
on
if
not
elate
still
never
plead
for
me
oh
thy
bright
eyes
must
answer
now
when
reason
with
a
scornful
brow
is
mocking
at
my
overthrow
oh
thy
sweet
tongue
must
plead
for
me
and
tell
why
i
have
chosen
thee
stern
reason
is
to
judgment
come
arrayed
in
all
her
forms
of
gloom
wilt
thou
my
advocate
be
dumb
no
radiant
angel
speak
and
say
why
i
did
cast
the
world
away
why
i
have
persevered
to
shun
the
common
paths
that
others
run
and
on
a
strange
road
journeyed
on
heedless
alike
of
wealth
and
power
of
glory
wreath
and
pleasure
flower
these
once
indeed
seemed
beings
divine
and
they
perchance
heard
vows
of
mine
and
saw
my
offerings
on
their
shrine
but
careless
gifts
are
seldom
prized
and
mine
were
worthily
despised
so
with
a
ready
heart
i
swore
to
seek
their
no
more
and
gave
my
spirit
to
adore
thee
phantom
thing
my
slave
my
comrade
and
my
king
a
slave
because
i
rule
thee
still
incline
thee
to
my
changeful
will
and
make
thy
influence
good
or
ill
a
comrade
for
by
day
and
night
thou
art
my
intimate
delight
my
darling
pain
that
wounds
and
sears
and
wrings
a
blessing
out
from
tears
by
deadening
me
to
earthly
cares
and
yet
a
king
though
prudence
well
have
taught
thy
subject
to
rebel
and
am
i
wrong
to
worship
where
faith
can
not
doubt
nor
hope
despair
since
my
own
soul
can
grant
my
prayer
speak
god
of
visions
plead
for
me
and
tell
why
i
have
chosen
thee
the
evening
passes
fast
away
is
almost
time
to
rest
what
thoughts
has
left
the
vanished
day
what
feelings
in
thy
breast
the
vanished
day
it
leaves
a
sense
of
labour
hardly
done
of
little
gained
with
vast
expense
a
sense
of
grief
alone
time
stands
before
the
door
of
death
upbraiding
bitterly
and
conscience
with
exhaustless
breath
pours
black
reproach
on
me
and
though
i
said
that
conscience
lies
and
time
should
fate
condemn
still
sad
repentance
clouds
my
eyes
and
makes
me
yield
to
them
then
art
thou
glad
to
seek
repose
art
glad
to
leave
the
sea
and
anchor
all
thy
weary
woes
in
calm
eternity
nothing
regrets
to
see
thee
go
not
one
voice
sobs
farewell
and
where
thy
heart
has
suffered
so
canst
thou
desire
to
dwell
alas
the
countless
links
are
strong
that
bind
us
to
our
clay
the
loving
spirit
lingers
long
and
would
not
pass
away
and
rest
is
sweet
when
laurelled
fame
will
crown
the
soldier
crest
but
a
brave
heart
with
a
tarnished
name
would
rather
fight
than
rest
well
thou
hast
fought
for
many
a
year
hast
fought
thy
whole
life
through
hast
humbled
falsehood
trampled
fear
what
is
there
left
to
do
is
true
this
arm
has
hotly
striven
has
dared
what
few
would
dare
much
have
i
done
and
freely
given
but
little
learnt
to
bear
look
on
the
grave
where
thou
must
sleep
thy
last
and
strongest
foe
it
is
endurance
not
to
weep
if
that
repose
seem
woe
the
long
war
closing
in
defeat
defeat
serenely
borne
thy
midnight
rest
may
still
be
sweet
and
break
in
glorious
morn
death
death

struck
when
i
was
most
confiding
in
my
certain
faith
of
joy
to
be

withered

dividing
from
the
fresh
root
of

upon

were
growing
brightly
full
of
sap
and
full
of
silver
dew
birds
beneath
its
shelter
gathered
nightly
daily
round
its
flowers
the
wild
bees
flew
sorrow
passed
and
plucked
the
golden
blossom
guilt
stripped
off
the
foliage
in
its
pride
but
within
its

ever

i
for
the
parted
gladness
for
the
vacant
nest
and
silent
song
hope
was
there
and
laughed
me
out
of
sadness
whispering

not
linger
long
and
behold
with
tenfold
increase

adorned

with

and

from

thine
cruel
death

and

gentle

may
still
restore
no

sunshine
mocks
my
time
for

must
never
blossom

strike
it
down
that
other
boughs
may

where
that
perished
sapling
used
to

mouldering
corpse

it
sprung

stanzas
to
well
some
may
hate
and
some
may
scorn
and
some
may
quite
forget
thy
name
but
my
sad
heart
must
ever
mourn
thy
ruined
hopes
thy
blighted
fame
was
thus
i
thought
an
hour
ago
even
weeping
that
wretch
woe
one
word
turned
back
my
gushing
tears
and
lit
my
altered
eye
with
sneers
then
bless
the
friendly
dust
i
said
that
hides
thy
unlamented
head
vain
as
thou
wert
and
weak
as
vain
the
slave
of
falsehood
pride
and
pain
my
heart
has
nought
akin
to
thine
thy
soul
is
powerless
over
mine
but
these
were
thoughts
that
vanished
too
unwise
unholy
and
untrue
do
i
despise
the
timid
deer
because
his
limbs
are
fleet
with
fear
or
would
i
mock
the
wolf
because
his
form
is
gaunt
and
foul
or
hear
with
joy
the
leveret
cry
because
it
can
not
bravely
die
no
then
above
his
memory
let
pity
heart
as
tender
be
say
earth
lie
lightly
on
that
breast
and
kind
heaven
grant
that
spirit
rest
honour
martyr
the
moon
is
full
this
winter
night
the
stars
are
clear
though
few
and
every
window
glistens
bright
with
leaves
of
frozen
dew
the
sweet
moon
through
your
lattice
gleams
and
lights
your
room
like
day
and
there
you
pass
in
happy
dreams
the
peaceful
hours
away
while
i
with
effort
hardly
quelling
the
anguish
in
my
breast
wander
about
the
silent
dwelling
and
can
not
think
of
rest
the
old
clock
in
the
gloomy
hall
ticks
on
from
hour
to
hour
and
every
time
its
measured
call
seems
lingering
slow
and
slower
and
oh
how
slow
that
star
has
tracked
the
chilly
gray
what
watching
yet
how
very
far
the
morning
lies
away
without
your
chamber
door
i
stand
love
are
you
slumbering
still
my
cold
heart
underneath
my
hand
has
almost
ceased
to
thrill
bleak
bleak
the
east
wind
sobs
and
sighs
and
drowns
the
turret
bell
whose
sad
note
undistinguished
dies
unheard
like
my
farewell
scorn
will
blight
my
name
and
hate
will
trample
me
will
load
me
with
a
coward
shame
a
traitor
perjury
false
friends
will
launch
their
covert
sneers
true
friends
will
wish
me
dead
and
i
shall
cause
the
bitterest
tears
that
you
have
ever
shed
the
dark
deeds
of
my
outlawed
race
will
then
like
virtues
shine
and
men
will
pardon
their
disgrace
beside
the
guilt
of
mine
for
who
forgives
the
accursed
crime
of
dastard
treachery
rebellion
in
its
chosen
time
may
freedom
champion
be
revenge
may
stain
a
righteous
sword
it
may
be
just
to
slay
but
traitor
traitor
from
that
word
all
true
breasts
shrink
away
oh
i
would
give
my
heart
to
death
to
keep
my
honour
fair
yet
i
not
give
my
inward
faith
my
honour
name
to
spare
not
even
to
keep
your
priceless
love
dare
i
beloved
deceive
this
treason
should
the
future
prove
then
only
then
believe
i
know
the
path
i
ought
to
go
i
follow
fearlessly
inquiring
not
what
deeper
woe
stern
duty
stores
for
me
so
foes
pursue
and
cold
allies
mistrust
me
every
one
let
me
be
false
in
others
eyes
if
faithful
in
my
own
stanzas
i
not
weep
that
thou
art
going
to
leave
me
there
nothing
lovely
here
and
doubly
will
the
dark
world
grieve
me
while
thy
heart
suffers
there
i
not
weep
because
the
summer
glory
must
always
end
in
gloom
and
follow
out
the
happiest
story
it
closes
with
a
tomb
and
i
am
weary
of
the
anguish
increasing
winters
bear
weary
to
watch
the
spirit
languish
through
years
of
dead
despair
so
if
a
tear
when
thou
art
dying
should
haply
fall
from
me
it
is
but
that
my
soul
is
sighing
to
go
and
rest
with
thee
my
comforter
well
hast
thou
spoken
and
yet
not
taught
a
feeling
strange
or
new
thou
hast
but
roused
a
latent
thought
a
beam
of
sunshine
brought
to
gleam
in
open
view
deep
down
concealed
within
my
soul
that
light
lies
hid
from
men
yet
glows
unquenched
though
shadows
roll
its
gentle
ray
can
not
control
about
the
sullen
den
was
i
not
vexed
in
these
gloomy
ways
to
walk
alone
so
long
around
me
wretches
uttering
praise
or
howling
their
hopeless
days
and
each
with
frenzy
tongue
a
brotherhood
of
misery
their
smiles
as
sad
as
sighs
whose
madness
daily
maddened
me
distorting
into
agony
the
bliss
before
my
eyes
so
stood
i
in
heaven
glorious
sun
and
in
the
glare
of
hell
my
spirit
drank
a
mingled
tone
of
seraph
song
and
demon
moan
what
my
soul
bore
my
soul
alone
within
itself
may
tell
like
a
soft
air
above
a
sea
tossed
by
the
tempest
stir
a
melting
quietly
the
on
some
wintry
lea
no
what
sweet
thing
resembles
thee
my
thoughtful
comforter
and
yet
a
little
longer
speak
calm
this
resentful
mood
and
while
the
savage
heart
grows
meek
for
other
token
do
not
seek
but
let
the
tear
upon
my
cheek
evince
my
gratitude
the
old
stoic
riches
i
hold
in
light
esteem
and
love
i
laugh
to
scorn
and
lust
of
fame
was
but
a
dream
that
vanished
with
the
morn
and
if
i
pray
the
only
prayer
that
moves
my
lips
for
me
is
leave
the
heart
that
now
i
bear
and
give
me
liberty
yes
as
my
swift
days
near
their
goal
is
all
that
i
implore
in
life
and
death
a
chainless
soul
with
courage
to
endure
poems
by
acton
bell
a
reminiscence
yes
thou
art
gone
and
never
more
thy
sunny
smile
shall
gladden
me
but
i
may
pass
the
old
church
door
and
pace
the
floor
that
covers
thee
may
stand
upon
the
cold
damp
stone
and
think
that
frozen
lies
below
the
lightest
heart
that
i
have
known
the
kindest
i
shall
ever
know
yet
though
i
can
not
see
thee
more
is
still
a
comfort
to
have
seen
and
though
thy
transient
life
is
is
sweet
to
think
that
thou
hast
been
to
think
a
soul
so
near
divine
within
a
form
so
angel
fair
united
to
a
heart
like
thine
has
gladdened
once
our
humble
sphere
the
arbour
i
rest
me
in
this
sheltered
bower
and
look
upon
the
clear
blue
sky
that
smiles
upon
me
through
the
trees
which
stand
so
thick
clustering
by
and
view
their
green
and
glossy
leaves
all
glistening
in
the
sunshine
fair
and
list
the
rustling
of
their
boughs
so
softly
whispering
through
the
air
and
while
my
ear
drinks
in
the
sound
my
winged
soul
shall
fly
away
reviewing
lone
departed
years
as
one
mild
beaming
autumn
day
and
soaring
on
to
future
scenes
like
hills
and
woods
and
valleys
green
all
basking
in
the
summer
sun
but
distant
still
and
dimly
seen
oh
list
is
summer
very
breath
that
gently
shakes
the
rustling
trees
but
look
the
snow
is
on
the
ground
how
can
i
think
of
scenes
like
these
is
but
the
frost
that
clears
the
air
and
gives
the
sky
that
lovely
blue
they
smiling
in
a
winter
sun
those
evergreens
of
sombre
hue
and
winter
chill
is
on
my
heart
how
can
i
dream
of
future
bliss
how
can
my
spirit
soar
away
confined
by
such
a
chain
as
this
home
how
brightly
glistening
in
the
sun
the
woodland
ivy
plays
while
yonder
beeches
from
their
barks
reflect
his
silver
rays
that
sun
surveys
a
lovely
scene
from
softly
smiling
skies
and
wildly
through
unnumbered
trees
the
wind
of
winter
sighs
now
loud
it
thunders
my
head
and
now
in
distance
dies
but
give
me
back
my
barren
hills
where
colder
breezes
rise
where
scarce
the
scattered
stunted
trees
can
yield
an
answering
swell
but
where
a
wilderness
of
heath
returns
the
sound
as
well
for
yonder
garden
fair
and
wide
with
groves
of
evergreen
long
winding
walks
and
borders
trim
and
velvet
lawns
between
restore
to
me
that
little
spot
with
gray
walls
compassed
round
where
knotted
grass
neglected
lies
and
weeds
usurp
the
ground
though
all
around
this
mansion
high
invites
the
foot
to
roam
and
though
its
halls
are
fair
within
oh
give
me
back
my
home
vanitas
vanitatum
omnia
vanitas
in
all
we
do
and
hear
and
see
is
restless
toil
and
vanity
while
yet
the
rolling
earth
abides
men
come
and
go
like
ocean
tides
and
ere
one
generation
dies
another
in
its
place
shall
rise
that
sinking
soon
into
the
grave
others
succeed
like
wave
on
wave
and
as
they
rise
they
pass
away
the
sun
arises
every
day
and
hastening
onward
to
the
west
he
nightly
sinks
but
not
to
rest
returning
to
the
eastern
skies
again
to
light
us
he
must
rise
and
still
the
restless
wind
comes
forth
now
blowing
keenly
from
the
north
now
from
the
south
the
east
the
west
for
ever
changing
at
rest
the
fountains
gushing
from
the
hills
supply
the
rills
the
thirsty
rivers
drink
their
store
and
bear
it
rolling
to
the
shore
but
still
the
ocean
craves
for
more
is
endless
labour
everywhere
sound
can
not
satisfy
the
ear
light
can
not
fill
the
craving
eye
nor
riches
half
our
wants
supply
pleasure
but
doubles
future
pain
and
joy
brings
sorrow
in
her
train
laughter
is
mad
and
reckless
mirth
what
does
she
in
this
weary
earth
should
wealth
or
fame
our
life
employ
death
comes
our
labour
to
destroy
to
snatch
the
untasted
cup
away
for
which
we
toiled
so
many
a
day
what
then
remains
for
wretched
man
to
use
life
comforts
while
he
can
enjoy
the
blessings
heaven
bestows
assist
his
friends
forgive
his
foes
trust
god
and
keep
his
statutes
still
upright
and
firm
through
good
and
ill
thankful
for
all
that
god
has
given
fixing
his
firmest
hopes
on
heaven
knowing
that
earthly
joys
decay
but
hoping
through
the
darkest
day
the
penitent
i
mourn
with
thee
and
yet
rejoice
that
thou
shouldst
sorrow
so
with
angel
choirs
i
join
my
voice
to
bless
the
sinner
woe
though
friends
and
kindred
turn
away
and
laugh
thy
grief
to
scorn
i
hear
the
great
redeemer
say
blessed
are
ye
that
mourn
hold
on
thy
course
nor
deem
it
strange
that
earthly
cords
are
riven
man
may
lament
the
wondrous
change
but
there
is
joy
in
heaven
music
on
christmas
morning
music
i
love
but
never
strain
could
kindle
raptures
so
divine
so
grief
assuage
so
conquer
pain
and
rouse
this
pensive
heart
of
mine
as
that
we
hear
on
christmas
morn
upon
the
wintry
breezes
borne
though
darkness
still
her
empire
keep
and
hours
must
pass
ere
morning
break
from
troubled
dreams
or
slumbers
deep
that
music
kindly
bids
us
wake
it
calls
us
with
an
angel
voice
to
wake
and
worship
and
rejoice
to
greet
with
joy
the
glorious
morn
which
angels
welcomed
long
ago
when
our
redeeming
lord
was
born
to
bring
the
light
of
heaven
below
the
powers
of
darkness
to
dispel
and
rescue
earth
from
death
and
hell
while
listening
to
that
sacred
strain
my
raptured
spirit
soars
on
high
i
seem
to
hear
those
songs
again
resounding
through
the
open
sky
that
kindled
such
divine
delight
in
those
who
watched
their
flocks
by
night
with
them
i
celebrate
his
birth
glory
to
god
in
highest
heaven
to
men
and
peace
on
earth
to
us
a
is
given
our
god
is
come
to
claim
his
own
and
satan
power
is
overthrown
a
sinless
god
for
sinful
men
descends
to
suffer
and
to
bleed
hell
must
renounce
its
empire
then
the
price
is
paid
the
world
is
freed
and
satan
self
must
now
confess
that
christ
has
earned
a
right
to
bless
now
holy
peace
may
smile
from
heaven
and
heavenly
truth
from
earth
shall
spring
the
captive
galling
bonds
are
riven
for
our
redeemer
is
our
king
and
he
that
gave
his
blood
for
men
will
lead
us
home
to
god
again
stanzas
oh
weep
not
love
each
tear
that
springs
in
those
dear
eyes
of
thine
to
me
a
keener
suffering
brings
than
if
they
flowed
from
mine
and
do
not
droop
however
drear
the
fate
awaiting
thee
for
my
sake
combat
pain
and
care
and
cherish
life
for
me
i
do
not
fear
thy
love
will
fail
thy
faith
is
true
i
know
but
oh
my
love
thy
strength
is
frail
for
such
a
life
of
woe
were
not
for
this
i
well
could
trace
though
banished
long
from
thee
life
rugged
path
and
boldly
face
the
storms
that
threaten
me
fear
not
for
me
i
steeled
my
mind
sorrow
and
strife
to
greet
joy
with
my
love
i
leave
behind
care
with
my
friends
i
meet
a
mother
sad
reproachful
eye
a
father
scowling
brow
but
he
may
frown
and
she
may
sigh
i
will
not
break
my
vow
i
love
my
mother
i
revere
my
sire
but
fear
not
me
believe
that
death
alone
can
tear
this
faithful
heart
from
thee
if
this
be
all
o
god
if
this
indeed
be
all
that
life
can
show
to
me
if
on
my
aching
brow
may
fall
no
freshening
dew
from
thee
if
with
no
brighter
light
than
this
the
lamp
of
hope
may
glow
and
i
may
only
dream
of
bliss
and
wake
to
weary
woe
if
friendship
solace
must
decay
when
other
joys
are
gone
and
love
must
keep
so
far
away
while
i
go
wandering
on
wandering
and
toiling
without
gain
the
slave
of
others
will
with
constant
care
and
frequent
pain
despised
forgotten
still
grieving
to
look
on
vice
and
sin
yet
powerless
to
quell
the
silent
current
from
within
the
outward
torrent
swell
while
all
the
good
i
would
impart
the
feelings
i
would
share
are
driven
backward
to
my
heart
and
turned
to
wormwood
there
if
clouds
must
ever
keep
from
sight
the
glories
of
the
sun
and
i
must
suffer
winter
blight
ere
summer
is
begun
if
life
must
be
so
full
of
care
then
call
me
soon
to
thee
or
give
me
strength
enough
to
bear
my
load
of
misery
memory
brightly
the
sun
of
summer
shone
green
fields
and
waving
woods
upon
and
soft
winds
wandered
by
above
a
sky
of
purest
blue
around
bright
flowers
of
loveliest
hue
allured
the
gazer
eye
but
what
were
all
these
charms
to
me
when
one
sweet
breath
of
memory
came
gently
wafting
by
i
closed
my
eyes
against
the
day
and
called
my
willing
soul
away
from
earth
and
air
and
sky
that
i
might
simply
fancy
there
one
little
flower
a
primrose
fair
just
opening
into
sight
as
in
the
days
of
infancy
an
opening
primrose
seemed
to
me
a
source
of
strange
delight
sweet
memory
ever
smile
on
me
nature
chief
beauties
spring
from
thee
oh
still
thy
tribute
bring
still
make
the
golden
crocus
shine
among
the
flowers
the
most
divine
the
glory
of
the
spring
still
in
the
wallflower
fragrance
dwell
and
hover
round
the
slight
bluebell
my
childhood
darling
flower
smile
on
the
little
daisy
still
the
buttercup
bright
goblet
fill
with
all
thy
former
power
for
ever
hang
thy
dreamy
spell
round
mountain
star
and
heather
bell
and
do
not
pass
away
from
sparkling
frost
or
wreathed
snow
and
whisper
when
the
wild
winds
blow
or
rippling
waters
play
is
childhood
then
so
all
divine
or
memory
is
the
glory
thine
that
haloes
thus
the
past
not
all
divine
its
pangs
of
grief
although
perchance
their
stay
be
brief
are
bitter
while
they
last
nor
is
the
glory
all
thine
own
for
on
our
earliest
joys
alone
that
holy
light
is
cast
with
such
a
ray
no
spell
of
thine
can
make
our
later
pleasures
shine
though
long
ago
they
passed
to
cowper
sweet
are
thy
strains
celestial
bard
and
oft
in
childhood
years
i
read
them
and
again
with
floods
of
silent
tears
the
language
of
my
inmost
heart
i
traced
in
every
line
my
sins
my
sorrows
hopes
and
fears
were
only
mine
all
for
myself
the
sigh
would
swell
the
tear
of
anguish
start
i
little
knew
what
wilder
woe
had
filled
the
poet
heart
i
did
not
know
the
nights
of
gloom
the
days
of
misery
the
long
long
years
of
dark
despair
that
crushed
and
tortured
thee
but
they
are
gone
from
earth
at
length
thy
gentle
soul
is
pass
and
in
the
bosom
of
its
god
has
found
its
home
at
last
it
must
be
so
if
god
is
love
and
answers
fervent
prayer
then
surely
thou
shalt
dwell
on
high
and
i
may
meet
thee
there
is
he
the
source
of
every
good
the
spring
of
purity
then
in
thine
hours
of
deepest
woe
thy
god
was
still
with
thee
how
else
when
every
hope
was
fled
couldst
thou
so
fondly
cling
to
holy
things
and
help
men
and
how
so
sweetly
sing
of
things
that
god
alone
could
teach
and
whence
that
purity
that
hatred
of
all
sinful
ways
that
gentle
charity
are
these
the
symptoms
of
a
heart
of
heavenly
grace
bereft
for
ever
banished
from
its
god
to
satan
fury
left
yet
should
thy
darkest
fears
be
true
if
heaven
be
so
severe
that
such
a
soul
as
thine
is
lost
oh
how
shall
i
appear
the
doubter
prayer
eternal
power
of
earth
and
air
unseen
yet
seen
in
all
around
remote
but
dwelling
everywhere
though
silent
heard
in
every
sound
if
thine
ear
in
mercy
bent
when
wretched
mortals
cried
to
thee
and
if
indeed
thy
son
was
sent
to
save
lost
sinners
such
as
me
then
hear
me
now
while
kneeling
here
i
lift
to
thee
my
heart
and
eye
and
all
my
soul
ascends
in
prayer
oh
give
me
give
me
faith
i
cry
without
some
glimmering
in
my
heart
i
could
not
raise
this
fervent
prayer
but
oh
a
stronger
light
impart
and
in
thy
mercy
fix
it
there
while
faith
is
with
me
i
am
blest
it
turns
my
darkest
night
to
day
but
while
i
clasp
it
to
my
breast
i
often
feel
it
slide
away
then
cold
and
dark
my
spirit
sinks
to
see
my
light
of
life
depart
and
every
fiend
of
hell
methinks
enjoys
the
anguish
of
my
heart
what
shall
i
do
if
all
my
love
my
hopes
my
toil
are
cast
away
and
if
there
be
no
god
above
to
hear
and
bless
me
when
i
pray
if
this
be
vain
delusion
all
if
death
be
an
eternal
sleep
and
none
can
hear
my
secret
call
or
see
the
silent
tears
i
weep
oh
help
me
god
for
thou
alone
canst
my
distracted
soul
relieve
forsake
it
not
it
is
thine
own
though
weak
yet
longing
to
believe
oh
drive
these
cruel
doubts
away
and
make
me
know
that
thou
art
god
a
faith
that
shines
by
night
and
day
will
lighten
every
earthly
load
if
i
believe
that
jesus
died
and
waking
rose
to
reign
above
then
surely
sorrow
sin
and
pride
must
yield
to
peace
and
hope
and
love
and
all
the
blessed
words
he
said
will
strength
and
holy
joy
impart
a
shield
of
safety
my
head
a
spring
of
comfort
in
my
heart
a
word
to
the
elect
you
may
rejoice
to
think
yourselves
secure
you
may
be
grateful
for
the
gift
divine
that
grace
unsought
which
made
your
black
hearts
pure
and
fits
your
souls
in
heaven
to
shine
but
is
it
sweet
to
look
around
and
view
thousands
excluded
from
that
happiness
which
they
deserved
at
least
as
much
as
their
faults
not
greater
nor
their
virtues
less
and
wherefore
should
you
love
your
god
the
more
because
to
you
alone
his
smiles
are
given
because
he
chose
to
pass
the
many
and
only
bring
the
favoured
few
to
heaven
and
wherefore
should
your
hearts
more
grateful
prove
because
for
all
the
saviour
did
not
die
is
yours
the
god
of
justice
and
of
love
and
are
your
bosoms
warm
with
charity
say
does
your
heart
expand
to
all
mankind
and
would
you
ever
to
your
neighbour
do
the
weak
the
strong
the
enlightened
and
the
blind
as
you
would
have
your
neighbour
do
to
you
and
when
you
looking
on
your
behold
them
doomed
to
endless
misery
how
can
you
talk
of
joy
and
rapture
then
may
god
withhold
such
cruel
joy
from
me
that
none
deserve
eternal
bliss
i
know
unmerited
the
grace
in
mercy
given
but
none
shall
sink
to
everlasting
woe
that
have
not
well
deserved
the
wrath
of
heaven
and
oh
there
lives
within
my
heart
a
hope
long
nursed
by
me
and
should
its
cheering
ray
depart
how
dark
my
soul
would
be
that
as
in
adam
all
have
died
in
christ
shall
all
men
live
and
ever
round
his
throne
abide
eternal
praise
to
give
that
even
the
wicked
shall
at
last
be
fitted
for
the
skies
and
when
their
dreadful
doom
is
past
to
life
and
light
arise
i
ask
not
how
remote
the
day
nor
what
the
sinners
woe
before
their
dross
is
purged
away
enough
for
me
to
know
that
when
the
cup
of
wrath
is
drained
the
metal
purified
they
cling
to
what
they
once
disdained
and
live
by
him
that
died
past
days
is
strange
to
think
there
was
a
time
when
mirth
was
not
an
empty
name
when
laughter
really
cheered
the
heart
and
frequent
smiles
unbidden
came
and
tears
of
grief
would
only
flow
in
sympathy
for
others
woe
when
speech
expressed
the
inward
thought
and
heart
to
kindred
heart
was
bare
and
summer
days
were
far
too
short
for
all
the
pleasures
crowded
there
and
silence
solitude
and
rest
now
welcome
to
the
weary
breast
were
all
unprized
uncourted
then
and
all
the
joy
one
spirit
showed
the
other
deeply
felt
again
and
friendship
like
a
river
flowed
constant
and
strong
its
silent
course
for
nought
withstood
its
gentle
force
when
night
the
holy
time
of
peace
was
dreaded
as
the
parting
hour
when
speech
and
mirth
at
once
must
cease
and
silence
must
resume
her
power
though
ever
free
from
pains
and
woes
she
only
brought
us
calm
repose
and
when
the
blessed
dawn
again
brought
daylight
to
the
blushing
skies
we
woke
and
not
reluctant
then
to
joyless
labour
did
we
rise
but
full
of
hope
and
glad
and
gay
we
welcomed
the
returning
day
the
consolation
though
bleak
these
woods
and
damp
the
ground
with
fallen
leaves
so
thickly
strown
and
cold
the
wind
that
wanders
round
with
wild
and
melancholy
moan
there
is
a
friendly
roof
i
know
might
shield
me
from
the
wintry
blast
there
is
a
fire
whose
ruddy
glow
will
cheer
me
for
my
wanderings
past
and
so
though
still
i
go
cold
meet
my
eye
though
when
my
spirit
sinks
in
woe
unheeded
swells
the
unbidden
sigh
though
solitude
endured
too
long
bids
youthful
joys
too
soon
decay
makes
mirth
a
stranger
to
my
tongue
and
overclouds
my
noon
of
day
when
kindly
thoughts
that
would
have
way
flow
back
discouraged
to
my
breast
i
know
there
is
though
far
away
a
home
where
heart
and
soul
may
rest
warm
hands
are
there
that
clasped
in
mine
the
warmer
heart
will
not
belie
while
mirth
and
truth
and
friendship
shine
in
smiling
lip
and
earnest
eye
the
ice
that
gathers
round
my
heart
may
there
be
thawed
and
sweetly
then
the
joys
of
youth
that
now
depart
will
come
to
cheer
my
soul
again
though
far
i
roam
that
thought
shall
be
my
hope
my
comfort
everywhere
while
such
a
home
remains
to
me
my
heart
shall
never
know
despair
lines
composed
in
a
wood
on
a
windy
day
my
soul
is
awakened
my
spirit
is
soaring
and
carried
aloft
on
the
wings
of
the
breeze
for
above
and
around
me
the
wild
wind
is
roaring
arousing
to
rapture
the
earth
and
the
seas
the
long
withered
grass
in
the
sunshine
is
glancing
the
bare
trees
are
tossing
their
branches
on
high
the
dead
leaves
beneath
them
are
merrily
dancing
the
white
clouds
are
scudding
across
the
blue
sky
i
wish
i
could
see
how
the
ocean
is
lashing
the
foam
of
its
billows
to
whirlwinds
of
spray
i
wish
i
could
see
how
its
proud
waves
are
dashing
and
hear
the
wild
roar
of
their
thunder
views
of
life
when
sinks
my
heart
in
hopeless
gloom
and
life
can
show
no
joy
for
me
and
i
behold
a
yawning
tomb
where
bowers
and
palaces
should
be
in
vain
you
talk
of
morbid
dreams
in
vain
you
gaily
smiling
say
that
what
to
me
so
dreary
seems
the
healthy
mind
deems
bright
and
gay
i
too
have
smiled
and
thought
like
you
but
madly
smiled
and
falsely
deemed
truth
led
me
to
the
present
view
i
waking
now
was
then
i
dreamed
i
lately
saw
a
sunset
sky
and
stood
enraptured
to
behold
its
varied
hues
of
glorious
dye
first
fleecy
clouds
of
shining
gold
these
blushing
took
a
rosy
hue
beneath
them
shone
a
flood
of
green
nor
less
divine
the
glorious
blue
that
smiled
above
them
and
between
i
can
not
name
each
lovely
shade
i
can
not
say
how
bright
they
shone
but
one
by
one
i
saw
them
fade
and
what
remained
when
they
were
gone
dull
clouds
remained
of
sombre
hue
and
when
their
borrowed
charm
was
the
azure
sky
had
faded
too
that
smiled
so
softly
bright
before
so
gilded
by
the
glow
of
youth
our
varied
life
looks
fair
and
gay
and
so
remains
the
naked
truth
when
that
false
light
is
past
away
why
blame
ye
then
my
keener
sight
that
clearly
sees
a
world
of
woes
through
all
the
haze
of
golden
light
that
flattering
falsehood
round
it
throws
when
the
young
mother
smiles
above
the
darling
of
her
heart
her
bosom
glows
with
earnest
love
while
tears
of
silent
transport
start
fond
dreamer
little
does
she
know
the
anxious
toil
the
suffering
the
blasted
hopes
the
burning
woe
the
object
of
her
joy
will
bring
her
blinded
eyes
behold
not
now
what
soon
or
late
must
be
his
doom
the
anguish
that
will
cloud
his
brow
the
bed
of
death
the
dreary
tomb
as
little
know
the
youthful
pair
in
mutual
love
supremely
blest
what
weariness
and
cold
despair
ere
long
will
seize
the
aching
breast
and
even
should
love
and
faith
remain
the
greatest
blessings
life
can
show
amid
adversity
and
pain
to
shine
throughout
with
cheering
glow
they
do
not
see
how
cruel
death
comes
on
their
loving
hearts
to
part
one
feels
not
now
the
gasping
breath
the
rending
of
the
heart
the
soul
and
body
agony
ere
she
may
sink
to
her
repose
the
sad
survivor
can
not
see
the
grave
above
his
darling
close
nor
how
despairing
and
alone
he
then
must
wear
his
life
away
and
linger
feebly
toiling
on
and
fainting
sink
into
decay
oh
youth
may
listen
patiently
while
sad
experience
tells
her
tale
but
doubt
sits
smiling
in
his
eye
for
ardent
hope
will
still
prevail
he
hears
how
feeble
pleasure
dies
by
guilt
destroyed
and
pain
and
woe
he
turns
to
hope
and
she
replies
believe
it
is
not
so
oh
heed
her
not
experience
says
for
thus
she
whispered
once
to
me
she
told
me
in
my
youthful
days
how
glorious
manhood
prime
would
be
when
in
the
time
of
early
spring
too
chill
the
winds
that
me
pass
she
said
each
coming
day
would
bring
a
fairer
heaven
a
gentler
blast
and
when
the
sun
too
seldom
beamed
the
sky
too
darkly
frowned
the
soaking
rain
too
constant
streamed
and
mists
too
dreary
gathered
round
she
told
me
summer
glorious
ray
would
chase
those
vapours
all
away
and
scatter
glories
round
with
sweetest
music
fill
the
trees
load
with
rich
scent
the
gentle
breeze
and
strew
with
flowers
the
ground
but
when
beneath
that
scorching
ray
i
languished
weary
through
the
day
while
birds
refused
to
sing
verdure
decayed
from
field
and
tree
and
panting
nature
mourned
with
me
the
freshness
of
the
spring
but
a
little
while
she
said
summer
burning
days
are
fled
and
autumn
shall
restore
with
golden
riches
of
her
own
and
summer
glories
mellowed
down
the
freshness
you
deplore
and
long
i
waited
but
in
vain
that
freshness
never
came
again
though
summer
passed
away
though
autumn
mists
hung
cold
and
chill
and
drooping
nature
languished
still
and
sank
into
decay
till
wintry
blasts
foreboding
blew
through
leafless
trees
and
then
i
knew
that
hope
was
all
a
dream
but
thus
fond
youth
she
cheated
me
and
she
will
prove
as
false
to
thee
though
sweet
her
words
may
seem
stern
prophet
cease
thy
bodings
dire
thou
canst
not
quench
the
ardent
fire
that
warms
the
breast
of
youth
oh
let
it
cheer
him
while
it
may
and
gently
gently
die
away
chilled
by
the
damps
of
truth
tell
him
that
earth
is
not
our
rest
its
joys
are
empty
frail
at
best
and
point
beyond
the
sky
but
gleams
of
light
may
reach
us
here
and
hope
the
roughest
path
can
cheer
then
do
not
bid
it
fly
though
hope
may
promise
joys
that
still
unkindly
time
will
fulfil
or
if
they
come
at
all
we
never
find
them
unalloyed
hurtful
perchance
or
soon
destroyed
they
vanish
or
they
pall
yet
hope
itself
a
brightness
throws
all
our
labours
and
our
woes
while
dark
foreboding
care
a
thousand
ills
will
oft
portend
that
providence
may
intend
the
trembling
heart
to
bear
or
if
they
come
it
oft
appears
our
woes
are
lighter
than
our
fears
and
far
more
bravely
borne
then
let
us
not
enhance
our
doom
but
in
midnight
blackest
gloom
expect
the
rising
morn
because
the
road
is
rough
and
long
shall
we
despise
the
skylark
song
that
cheers
the
wanderer
way
or
trample
down
with
reckless
feet
the
smiling
flowerets
bright
and
sweet
because
they
soon
decay
pass
pleasant
scenes
unnoticed
by
because
the
next
is
bleak
and
drear
or
not
enjoy
a
smiling
sky
because
a
tempest
may
be
near
no
while
we
journey
on
our
way
we
smile
on
every
lovely
thing
and
ever
as
they
pass
away
to
memory
and
hope
we
cling
and
though
that
awful
river
flows
before
us
when
the
journey
past
perchance
of
all
the
pilgrim
woes
most
dreadful
shrink
not
is
the
last
though
icy
cold
and
dark
and
deep
beyond
it
smiles
that
blessed
shore
where
none
shall
suffer
none
shall
weep
and
bliss
shall
reign
for
evermore
appeal
oh
i
am
very
weary
though
tears
no
longer
flow
my
eyes
are
tired
of
weeping
my
heart
is
sick
of
woe
my
life
is
very
lonely
my
days
pass
heavily
i
weary
of
repining
wilt
thou
not
come
to
me
oh
didst
thou
know
my
longings
for
thee
from
day
to
day
my
hopes
so
often
blighted
thou
wouldst
not
thus
delay
the
student
serenade
i
have
slept
upon
my
couch
but
my
spirit
did
not
rest
for
the
labours
of
the
day
yet
my
weary
soul
opprest
and
before
my
dreaming
eyes
still
the
learned
volumes
lay
and
i
could
not
close
their
leaves
and
i
could
not
turn
away
but
i
oped
my
eyes
at
last
and
i
heard
a
muffled
sound
was
the
come
to
say
that
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
then
i
knew
that
there
was
rest
on
the
mountain
bosom
free
so
i
left
my
fevered
couch
and
i
flew
to
waken
thee
i
have
flown
to
waken
thee
for
if
thou
wilt
not
arise
then
my
soul
can
drink
no
peace
from
these
holy
moonlight
skies
and
this
waste
of
virgin
snow
to
my
sight
will
not
be
fair
unless
thou
wilt
smiling
come
love
to
wander
with
me
there
then
awake
maria
wake
for
if
thou
couldst
only
know
how
the
quiet
moonlight
sleeps
on
this
wilderness
of
snow
and
the
groves
of
ancient
trees
in
their
snowy
garb
arrayed
till
they
stretch
into
the
gloom
of
the
distant
valley
shade
i
know
thou
wouldst
rejoice
to
inhale
this
bracing
air
thou
wouldst
break
thy
sweetest
sleep
to
behold
a
scene
so
fair
these
wintry
wilds
alone
thou
wouldst
joy
to
wander
free
and
it
will
not
please
thee
less
though
that
bliss
be
shared
with
me
the
captive
dove
poor
restless
dove
i
pity
thee
and
when
i
hear
thy
plaintive
moan
i
mourn
for
thy
captivity
and
in
thy
woes
forget
mine
own
to
see
thee
stand
prepared
to
fly
and
flap
those
useless
wings
of
thine
and
gaze
into
the
distant
sky
would
melt
a
harder
heart
than
mine
in
vain
in
vain
thou
canst
not
rise
thy
prison
roof
confines
thee
there
its
slender
wires
delude
thine
eyes
and
quench
thy
longings
with
despair
oh
thou
wert
made
to
wander
free
in
sunny
mead
and
shady
grove
and
far
beyond
the
rolling
sea
in
distant
climes
at
will
to
rove
yet
hadst
thou
but
one
gentle
mate
thy
little
drooping
heart
to
cheer
and
share
with
thee
thy
captive
state
thou
couldst
be
happy
even
there
yes
even
there
if
listening
by
one
faithful
dear
companion
stood
while
gazing
on
her
full
bright
eye
thou
mightst
forget
thy
native
wood
but
thou
poor
solitary
dove
must
make
unheard
thy
joyless
moan
the
heart
that
nature
formed
to
love
must
pine
neglected
and
alone
ellen
you
were
thoughtless
once
of
beauty
or
of
grace
simple
and
homely
in
attire
careless
of
form
and
face
then
whence
this
change
and
wherefore
now
so
often
smoothe
your
hair
and
wherefore
deck
your
youthful
form
with
such
unwearied
care
tell
us
and
cease
to
tire
our
ears
with
that
familiar
strain
why
will
you
play
those
simple
tunes
so
often
again
indeed
dear
friends
i
can
but
say
that
childhood
thoughts
are
gone
each
year
its
own
new
feelings
brings
and
years
move
swiftly
on
and
for
these
little
simple
airs
i
love
to
play
them
so
much
i
dare
not
promise
now
to
play
them
never
more
i
answered
and
it
was
enough
they
turned
them
to
depart
they
could
not
read
my
secret
thoughts
nor
see
my
throbbing
heart
i
noticed
many
a
youthful
form
upon
whose
changeful
face
the
inmost
workings
of
the
soul
the
gazer
well
might
trace
the
speaking
eye
the
changing
lip
the
ready
blushing
cheek
the
smiling
or
beclouded
brow
their
different
feelings
speak
but
thank
god
you
might
gaze
on
mine
for
hours
and
never
know
the
secret
changes
of
my
soul
from
joy
to
keenest
woe
last
night
as
we
sat
round
the
fire
conversing
merrily
we
heard
without
approaching
steps
of
one
well
known
to
me
there
was
no
trembling
in
my
voice
no
blush
upon
my
cheek
no
lustrous
sparkle
in
my
eyes
of
hope
or
joy
to
speak
but
oh
my
spirit
burned
within
my
heart
beat
full
and
fast
he
came
not
nigh
he
went
away
and
then
my
joy
was
past
and
yet
my
comrades
marked
it
not
my
voice
was
still
the
same
they
saw
me
smile
and
my
face
no
signs
of
sadness
came
they
little
knew
my
hidden
thoughts
and
they
will
never
know
the
aching
anguish
of
my
heart
the
bitter
burning
woe
fluctuations
what
though
the
sun
had
left
my
sky
to
save
me
from
despair
the
blessed
moon
arose
on
high
and
shone
serenely
there
i
watched
her
with
a
tearful
gaze
rise
slowly
the
hill
while
through
the
dim
horizon
haze
her
light
gleamed
faint
and
chill
i
thought
such
wan
and
lifeless
beams
could
my
heart
repay
for
the
bright
sun
most
transient
gleams
that
cheered
me
through
the
day
but
as
above
that
mist
control
she
rose
and
brighter
shone
i
felt
her
light
upon
my
soul
but
now
that
light
is
gone
thick
vapours
snatched
her
from
my
sight
and
i
was
darkling
left
all
in
the
cold
and
gloomy
night
of
light
and
hope
bereft
until
methought
a
little
star
shone
forth
with
trembling
ray
to
cheer
me
with
its
light
afar
but
that
too
passed
away
anon
an
earthly
meteor
blazed
the
gloomy
darkness
through
i
smiled
yet
trembled
while
i
gazed
but
that
soon
vanished
too
and
darker
drearier
fell
the
night
upon
my
spirit
then
but
what
is
that
faint
struggling
light
is
it
the
moon
again
kind
heaven
increase
that
silvery
gleam
and
bid
these
clouds
depart
and
let
her
soft
celestial
beam
restore
my
fainting
heart
selections
from
the
literary
remains
of
ellis
and
acton
bell
by
currer
bell
selections
from
poems
by
ellis
bell
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
compile
a
volume
out
of
the
papers
left
by
my
sisters
had
i
in
making
the
selection
dismissed
from
my
consideration
the
scruples
and
the
wishes
of
those
whose
written
thoughts
these
papers
held
but
this
was
impossible
an
influence
stronger
than
could
be
exercised
by
any
motive
of
expediency
necessarily
regulated
the
selection
i
have
then
culled
from
the
mass
only
a
little
poem
here
and
there
the
whole
makes
but
a
tiny
nosegay
and
the
colour
and
perfume
of
the
flowers
are
not
such
as
fit
them
for
festal
uses
it
has
been
already
said
that
my
sisters
wrote
much
in
childhood
and
girlhood
usually
it
seems
a
sort
of
injustice
to
expose
in
print
the
crude
thoughts
of
the
unripe
mind
the
rude
efforts
of
the
unpractised
hand
yet
i
venture
to
give
three
little
poems
of
my
sister
emily
written
in
her
sixteenth
year
because
they
illustrate
a
point
in
her
character
at
that
period
she
was
sent
to
school
her
previous
life
with
the
exception
of
a
single
had
been
passed
in
the
absolute
retirement
of
a
village
parsonage
amongst
the
hills
bordering
yorkshire
and
lancashire
the
scenery
of
these
hills
is
not
grand
it
is
not
romantic
it
is
scarcely
striking
long
low
moors
dark
with
heath
shut
in
little
valleys
where
a
stream
waters
here
and
there
a
fringe
of
stunted
copse
mills
and
scattered
cottages
chase
romance
from
these
valleys
it
is
only
higher
up
deep
in
amongst
the
ridges
of
the
moors
that
imagination
can
find
rest
for
the
sole
of
her
foot
and
even
if
she
finds
it
there
she
must
be
a
raven
no
gentle
dove
if
she
demand
beauty
to
inspire
her
she
must
bring
it
inborn
these
moors
are
too
stern
to
yield
any
product
so
delicate
the
eye
of
the
gazer
must
itself
brim
with
a
purple
light
intense
enough
to
perpetuate
the
brief
of
august
on
the
heather
or
the
rare
of
june
out
of
his
heart
must
well
the
freshness
that
in
latter
spring
and
early
summer
brightens
the
bracken
nurtures
the
moss
and
cherishes
the
starry
flowers
that
spangle
for
a
few
weeks
the
pasture
of
the
unless
that
light
and
freshness
are
innate
and
the
drear
prospect
of
a
yorkshire
moor
will
be
found
as
barren
of
poetic
as
of
agricultural
interest
where
the
love
of
wild
nature
is
strong
the
locality
will
perhaps
be
clung
to
with
the
more
passionate
constancy
because
from
the
self
comes
half
its
charm
my
sister
emily
loved
the
moors
flowers
brighter
than
the
rose
bloomed
in
the
blackest
of
the
heath
for
her
out
of
a
sullen
hollow
in
a
livid
her
mind
could
make
an
eden
she
found
in
the
bleak
solitude
many
and
dear
delights
and
not
the
least
and
best
loved
was
liberty
liberty
was
the
breath
of
emily
nostrils
without
it
she
perished
the
change
from
her
own
home
to
a
school
and
from
her
own
very
noiseless
very
secluded
but
unrestricted
and
inartificial
mode
of
life
to
one
of
disciplined
routine
though
under
the
kindliest
auspices
was
what
she
failed
in
enduring
her
nature
proved
here
too
strong
for
her
fortitude
every
morning
when
she
woke
the
vision
of
home
and
the
moors
rushed
on
her
and
darkened
and
saddened
the
day
that
lay
before
her
nobody
knew
what
ailed
her
but
me
i
knew
only
too
well
in
this
struggle
her
health
was
quickly
broken
her
white
face
attenuated
form
and
failing
strength
threatened
rapid
decline
i
felt
in
my
heart
she
would
die
if
she
did
not
go
home
and
with
this
conviction
obtained
her
recall
she
had
only
been
three
months
at
school
and
it
was
some
years
before
the
experiment
of
sending
her
from
home
was
again
ventured
on
after
the
age
of
twenty
having
meantime
studied
alone
with
diligence
and
perseverance
she
went
with
me
to
an
establishment
on
the
continent
the
same
suffering
and
conflict
ensued
heightened
by
the
strong
recoil
of
her
upright
heretic
and
english
spirit
from
the
gentle
jesuitry
of
the
foreign
and
romish
system
once
more
she
seemed
sinking
but
this
time
she
rallied
through
the
mere
force
of
resolution
with
inward
remorse
and
shame
she
looked
back
on
her
former
failure
and
resolved
to
conquer
in
this
second
ordeal
she
did
conquer
but
the
victory
cost
her
dear
she
was
never
happy
till
she
carried
her
knowledge
back
to
the
remote
english
village
the
old
and
desolate
yorkshire
hills
a
very
few
years
more
and
she
looked
her
last
on
those
hills
and
breathed
her
last
in
that
house
and
under
the
aisle
of
that
obscure
village
church
found
her
last
lowly
merciful
was
the
decree
that
spared
her
when
she
was
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
and
guarded
her
dying
bed
with
kindred
love
and
congenial
constancy
the
following
pieces
were
composed
at
twilight
in
the
when
the
leisure
of
the
evening
brought
back
in
full
tide
the
thoughts
of
home
i
a
little
while
a
little
while
the
weary
task
is
put
away
and
i
can
sing
and
i
can
smile
alike
while
i
have
holiday
where
wilt
thou
go
my
harassed
heart
what
thought
what
scene
invites
thee
now
what
spot
or
near
or
far
apart
has
rest
for
thee
my
weary
brow
there
is
a
spot
barren
hills
where
winter
howls
and
driving
rain
but
if
the
dreary
tempest
chills
there
is
a
light
that
warms
again
the
house
is
old
the
trees
are
bare
moonless
above
bends
twilight
dome
but
what
on
earth
is
half
so
dear
so
longed
for
as
the
hearth
of
home
the
mute
bird
sitting
on
the
stone
the
dank
moss
dripping
from
the
wall
the
gaunt
the
walks
i
love
them
how
i
love
them
all
still
as
i
mused
the
naked
room
the
alien
firelight
died
away
and
from
the
midst
of
cheerless
gloom
i
passed
to
bright
unclouded
day
a
little
and
a
lone
green
lane
that
opened
on
a
common
wide
a
distant
dreamy
dim
blue
chain
of
mountains
circling
every
side
a
heaven
so
clear
an
earth
so
calm
so
sweet
so
soft
so
hushed
an
air
and
deepening
still
the
charm
wild
feeding
everywhere
that
was
the
scene
i
knew
it
well
i
knew
the
turfy
pathway
sweep
that
winding
each
billowy
swell
marked
out
the
tracks
of
wandering
sheep
could
i
have
lingered
but
an
hour
it
well
had
paid
a
week
of
toil
but
truth
has
banished
fancy
power
restraint
and
heavy
task
recoil
even
as
i
stood
with
raptured
eye
absorbed
in
bliss
so
deep
and
dear
my
hour
of
rest
had
fleeted
by
and
back
came
labour
bondage
care
ii
the
bluebell
the
bluebell
is
the
sweetest
flower
that
waves
in
summer
air
its
blossoms
have
the
mightiest
power
to
soothe
my
spirit
care
there
is
a
spell
in
purple
heath
too
wildly
sadly
dear
the
violet
has
a
fragrant
breath
but
fragrance
will
not
cheer
the
trees
are
bare
the
sun
is
cold
and
seldom
seldom
seen
the
heavens
have
lost
their
zone
of
gold
and
earth
her
robe
of
green
and
ice
upon
the
glancing
stream
has
cast
its
sombre
shade
and
distant
hills
and
valleys
seem
in
frozen
mist
arrayed
the
bluebell
can
not
charm
me
now
the
heath
has
lost
its
bloom
the
violets
in
the
glen
below
they
yield
no
sweet
perfume
but
though
i
mourn
the
sweet
bluebell
is
better
far
away
i
know
how
fast
my
tears
would
swell
to
see
it
smile
for
oh
when
chill
the
sunbeams
fall
adown
that
dreary
sky
and
gild
yon
dank
and
darkened
wall
with
transient
brilliancy
how
do
i
weep
how
do
i
pine
for
the
time
of
flowers
to
come
and
turn
me
from
that
fading
shine
to
mourn
the
fields
of
home
iii
loud
without
the
wind
was
roaring
through
sky
drenching
wet
the
cold
rain
pouring
spoke
of
winter
nigh
all
too
like
that
dreary
eve
did
my
exiled
spirit
grieve
grieved
at
first
but
grieved
not
long
sweet
how
softly
sweet
it
came
wild
words
of
an
ancient
song
undefined
without
a
name
it
was
spring
and
the
skylark
was
singing
those
words
they
awakened
a
spell
they
unlocked
a
deep
fountain
whose
springing
nor
absence
nor
distance
can
quell
in
the
gloom
of
a
cloudy
november
they
uttered
the
music
of
may
they
kindled
the
perishing
ember
into
fervour
that
could
not
decay
awaken
all
my
dear
moorland
in
thy
glory
and
pride
oh
call
me
from
valley
and
lowland
to
walk
by
the
side
it
is
swelled
with
the
first
snowy
weather
the
rocks
they
are
icy
and
hoar
and
sullenly
waves
the
long
heather
and
the
fern
leaves
are
sunny
no
more
there
are
no
yellow
stars
on
the
mountain
the
bluebells
have
long
died
away
from
the
brink
of
the
fountain
from
the
side
of
the
wintry
brae
but
lovelier
than
all
waving
in
emerald
and
vermeil
and
gold
are
the
heights
where
the
is
raving
and
the
crags
where
i
wandered
of
old
it
was
morning
the
bright
sun
was
beaming
how
sweetly
it
brought
back
to
me
the
time
when
nor
labour
nor
dreaming
broke
the
sleep
of
the
happy
and
free
but
blithely
we
rose
as
the
was
melting
to
amber
and
blue
and
swift
were
the
wings
to
our
feet
given
as
we
traversed
the
meadows
of
dew
for
the
moors
for
the
moors
where
the
short
grass
like
velvet
beneath
us
should
lie
for
the
moors
for
the
moors
where
each
high
pass
rose
sunny
against
the
clear
sky
for
the
moors
where
the
linnet
was
trilling
its
song
on
the
old
granite
stone
where
the
lark
the
wild
was
filling
every
breast
with
delight
like
its
own
what
language
can
utter
the
feeling
which
rose
when
in
exile
afar
on
the
brow
of
a
lonely
hill
kneeling
i
saw
the
brown
heath
growing
there
it
was
scattered
and
stunted
and
told
me
that
soon
even
that
would
be
gone
it
whispered
the
grim
walls
enfold
me
i
have
bloomed
in
my
last
summer
sun
but
not
the
loved
music
whose
waking
makes
the
soul
of
the
swiss
die
away
has
a
spell
more
adored
and
heartbreaking
than
for
me
in
that
blighted
heath
lay
the
spirit
which
bent
its
power
how
it
longed
how
it
burned
to
be
free
if
i
could
have
wept
in
that
hour
those
tears
had
been
heaven
to
me
well
well
the
sad
minutes
are
moving
though
loaded
with
trouble
and
pain
and
some
time
the
loved
and
the
loving
shall
meet
on
the
mountains
again
the
following
little
piece
has
no
title
but
in
it
the
genius
of
a
solitary
region
seems
to
address
his
wandering
and
wayward
votary
and
to
recall
within
his
influence
the
proud
mind
which
rebelled
at
times
even
against
what
it
most
loved
shall
earth
no
more
inspire
thee
thou
lonely
dreamer
now
since
passion
may
not
fire
thee
shall
nature
cease
to
bow
thy
mind
is
ever
moving
in
regions
dark
to
thee
recall
its
useless
roving
come
back
and
dwell
with
me
i
know
my
mountain
breezes
enchant
and
soothe
thee
still
i
know
my
sunshine
pleases
despite
thy
wayward
will
when
day
with
evening
blending
sinks
from
the
summer
sky
i
seen
thy
spirit
bending
in
fond
idolatry
i
watched
thee
every
hour
i
know
my
mighty
sway
i
know
my
magic
power
to
drive
thy
griefs
away
few
hearts
to
mortals
given
on
earth
so
wildly
pine
yet
few
would
ask
a
heaven
more
like
this
earth
than
thine
then
let
my
winds
caress
thee
thy
comrade
let
me
be
since
nought
beside
can
bless
thee
return
and
dwell
with
me
here
again
is
the
same
mind
in
converse
with
a
like
abstraction
the
breathing
through
an
open
window
has
visited
an
ear
which
discerned
language
in
its
whispers
the
in
summer
mellow
midnight
a
cloudless
moon
shone
through
our
open
parlour
window
and
wet
with
dew
i
sat
in
silent
musing
the
soft
wind
waved
my
hair
it
told
me
heaven
was
glorious
and
sleeping
earth
was
fair
i
needed
not
its
breathing
to
bring
such
thoughts
to
me
but
still
it
whispered
lowly
how
dark
the
woods
will
be
the
thick
leaves
in
my
murmur
are
rustling
like
a
dream
and
all
their
myriad
voices
instinct
with
spirit
seem
i
said
go
gentle
singer
thy
wooing
voice
is
kind
but
do
not
think
its
music
has
power
to
reach
my
mind
play
with
the
scented
flower
the
young
tree
supple
bough
and
leave
my
human
feelings
in
their
own
course
to
flow
the
wanderer
would
not
heed
me
its
kiss
grew
warmer
still
o
come
it
sighed
so
sweetly
i
win
thee
thy
will
were
we
not
friends
from
childhood
have
i
not
loved
thee
long
as
long
as
thou
the
solemn
night
whose
silence
wakes
my
song
and
when
thy
heart
is
resting
beneath
the
stone
i
shall
have
time
for
mourning
and
thou
for
being
alone
in
these
stanzas
a
louder
gale
has
roused
the
sleeper
on
her
pillow
the
wakened
soul
struggles
to
blend
with
the
storm
by
which
it
is
swayed
ay
there
it
is
it
wakes
deep
feelings
i
thought
dead
strong
in
the
blast
quick
gathering
light
the
heart
flame
kindles
red
now
i
can
tell
by
thine
altered
cheek
and
by
thine
eyes
full
gaze
and
by
the
words
thou
scarce
dost
speak
how
wildly
fancy
plays
yes
i
could
swear
that
glorious
wind
has
swept
the
world
aside
has
dashed
its
memory
from
thy
mind
like
from
the
tide
and
thou
art
now
a
spirit
pouring
thy
presence
into
all
the
thunder
of
the
tempest
roaring
the
whisper
of
its
fall
an
universal
influence
from
thine
own
influence
free
a
principle
of
life
intense
lost
to
mortality
thus
truly
when
that
breast
is
cold
thy
prisoned
soul
shall
rise
the
dungeon
mingle
with
the
mould
the
captive
with
the
skies
nature
deep
being
thine
shall
hold
her
spirit
all
thy
spirit
fold
her
breath
absorb
thy
sighs
mortal
though
soon
life
tale
is
told
who
once
lives
never
dies
love
and
friendship
love
is
like
the
wild
friendship
like
the
the
holly
is
dark
when
the
blooms
but
which
will
bloom
most
constantly
the
wild
is
sweet
in
spring
its
summer
blossoms
scent
the
air
yet
wait
till
winter
comes
again
and
who
will
call
the
fair
then
scorn
the
silly
now
and
deck
thee
with
the
holly
sheen
that
when
december
blights
thy
brow
he
still
may
leave
thy
garland
green
the
elder
rebuke
listen
when
your
hair
like
mine
takes
a
tint
of
silver
gray
when
your
eyes
with
dimmer
shine
watch
life
bubbles
float
away
when
you
young
man
have
borne
like
me
the
weary
weight
of
then
shall
penance
sore
be
paid
for
those
hours
so
wildly
squandered
and
the
words
that
now
fall
dead
on
your
ear
be
deeply
pondered
pondered
and
approved
at
last
but
their
virtue
will
be
past
glorious
is
the
prize
of
duty
though
she
be
serious
power
treacherous
all
the
lures
of
beauty
thorny
bud
and
poisonous
flower
mirth
is
but
a
mad
beguiling
of
the
time
love
a
wiling
heedless
feet
to
gulfs
of
crime
those
who
follow
earthly
pleasure
heavenly
knowledge
will
not
lead
wisdom
hides
from
them
her
treasure
virtue
bids
them
vainly
may
their
hearts
repenting
seek
for
aid
in
future
years
wisdom
scorned
knows
no
relenting
virtue
is
not
won
by
fears
thus
spake
the
elder
gray
the
young
man
scoffed
as
he
turned
away
turned
to
the
call
of
a
sweet
lute
measure
waked
by
the
lightsome
touch
of
pleasure
had
he
met
a
gentler
teacher
woe
had
been
wrought
by
that
pitiless
preacher
the
wanderer
from
the
fold
how
few
of
all
the
hearts
that
loved
are
grieving
for
thee
now
and
why
should
mine
be
moved
with
such
a
sense
of
woe
too
often
thus
when
left
alone
where
none
my
thoughts
can
see
comes
back
a
word
a
passing
tone
from
thy
strange
history
sometimes
i
seem
to
see
thee
rise
a
glorious
child
again
all
virtues
beaming
from
thine
eyes
that
ever
honoured
men
courage
and
truth
a
generous
breast
where
sinless
sunshine
lay
a
being
whose
very
presence
blest
like
gladsome
o
fairly
spread
thy
early
sail
and
fresh
and
pure
and
free
was
the
first
impulse
of
the
gale
which
urged
life
wave
for
thee
why
did
the
pilot
too
confiding
dream
that
ocean
foam
and
trust
in
pleasure
careless
guiding
to
bring
his
vessel
home
for
well
he
knew
what
dangers
frowned
what
mists
would
gather
dim
what
rocks
and
shelves
and
sands
lay
round
between
his
port
and
him
the
very
brightness
of
the
sun
the
splendour
of
the
main
the
wind
which
bore
him
wildly
on
should
not
have
warned
in
vain
an
anxious
gazer
from
the
shore
i
marked
the
whitening
wave
and
wept
above
thy
fate
the
more
because
i
could
not
save
it
recks
not
now
when
all
is
over
but
yet
my
heart
will
be
a
mourner
still
though
friend
and
lover
have
both
forgotten
thee
warning
and
reply
in
the
earth
the
earth
thou
shalt
be
laid
a
grey
stone
standing
over
thee
black
mould
beneath
thee
spread
and
black
mould
to
cover
thee
well
there
is
rest
there
so
fast
come
thy
prophecy
the
time
when
my
sunny
hair
shall
with
grass
roots
entwined
be
but
cold
cold
is
that
shut
out
from
joy
and
liberty
and
all
who
loved
thy
living
face
will
shrink
from
it
shudderingly
not
so
here
the
world
is
chill
and
sworn
friends
fall
from
me
but
there
they
will
own
me
still
and
prize
my
memory
farewell
then
all
that
love
all
that
deep
sympathy
sleep
on
heaven
laughs
above
earth
never
misses
thee
and
tombstone
drear
part
human
company
one
heart
breaks
only
here
but
that
heart
was
worthy
thee
last
words
i
knew
not
was
so
dire
a
crime
to
say
the
word
adieu
but
this
shall
be
the
only
time
my
lips
or
heart
shall
sue
that
wild
the
winter
morn
the
gnarled
and
ancient
tree
if
in
your
breast
they
waken
scorn
shall
wake
the
same
in
me
i
can
forget
black
eyes
and
brows
and
lips
of
falsest
charm
if
you
forget
the
sacred
vows
those
faithless
lips
could
form
if
hard
commands
can
tame
your
love
or
strongest
walls
can
hold
i
would
not
wish
to
grieve
above
a
thing
so
false
and
cold
and
there
are
bosoms
bound
to
mine
with
links
both
tried
and
strong
and
there
are
eyes
whose
lightning
shine
has
warmed
and
blest
me
long
those
eyes
shall
make
my
only
day
shall
set
my
spirit
free
and
chase
the
foolish
thoughts
away
that
mourn
your
memory
the
lady
to
her
guitar
for
him
who
struck
thy
foreign
string
i
ween
this
heart
has
ceased
to
care
then
why
dost
thou
such
feelings
bring
to
my
sad
spirit
old
guitar
it
is
as
if
the
warm
sunlight
in
some
deep
glen
should
lingering
stay
when
clouds
of
storm
or
shades
of
night
have
wrapt
the
parent
orb
away
it
is
as
if
the
glassy
brook
should
image
still
its
willows
fair
though
years
ago
the
woodman
stroke
laid
low
in
dust
their
even
so
guitar
thy
magic
tone
hath
moved
the
tear
and
waked
the
sigh
hath
bid
the
ancient
torrent
moan
although
its
very
source
is
dry
the
two
children
heavy
hangs
the
from
the
burdened
spray
heavy
broods
the
damp
mist
on
uplands
far
away
heavy
looms
the
dull
sky
heavy
rolls
the
sea
and
heavy
throbs
the
young
heart
beneath
that
lonely
tree
never
has
a
blue
streak
cleft
the
clouds
since
morn
never
has
his
grim
fate
smiled
since
he
was
born
frowning
on
the
infant
shadowing
childhood
joy
knows
not
that
melancholy
boy
day
is
passing
swiftly
its
sad
and
sombre
prime
boyhood
sad
is
merging
in
sadder
manhood
time
all
the
flowers
are
praying
for
sun
before
they
close
and
he
prays
too
unconscious
that
sunless
human
rose
blossom
that
the
has
never
wooed
to
blow
scentless
are
thy
petals
thy
dew
is
cold
as
snow
soul
where
kindred
kindness
no
early
promise
woke
barren
is
thy
beauty
as
weed
upon
a
rock
wither
soul
and
blossom
you
both
were
vainly
given
earth
reserves
no
blessing
for
the
unblest
of
heaven
child
of
delight
with
hair
and
eyes
spirit
of
bliss
what
brings
thee
here
beneath
these
sullen
skies
thou
shouldst
live
in
eternal
spring
where
endless
day
is
never
dim
why
seraph
has
thine
erring
wing
wafted
thee
down
to
weep
with
him
ah
not
from
heaven
am
i
descended
nor
do
i
come
to
mingle
tears
but
sweet
is
day
though
with
shadows
blended
and
though
clouded
sweet
are
youthful
years
i
the
image
of
light
and
gladness
saw
and
pitied
that
mournful
boy
and
i
vowed
if
need
were
to
share
his
sadness
and
give
to
him
my
sunny
joy
heavy
and
dark
the
night
is
closing
heavy
and
dark
may
its
biding
be
better
for
all
from
grief
reposing
and
better
for
all
who
watch
like
me
watch
in
love
by
a
fevered
pillow
cooling
the
fever
with
pity
balm
safe
as
the
petrel
on
tossing
billow
safe
in
mine
own
soul
golden
calm
he
lacks
no
longer
evil
fortune
he
need
not
fear
fate
is
strong
but
love
is
stronger
and
my
love
is
truer
than
the
visionary
silent
is
the
house
all
are
laid
asleep
one
alone
looks
out
the
deep
watching
every
cloud
dreading
every
breeze
that
whirls
the
wildering
drift
and
bends
the
groaning
trees
cheerful
is
the
hearth
soft
the
matted
floor
not
one
shivering
gust
creeps
through
pane
or
door
the
little
lamp
burns
straight
its
rays
shoot
strong
and
far
i
trim
it
well
to
be
the
wanderer
frown
my
haughty
sire
chide
my
angry
dame
set
your
slaves
to
spy
threaten
me
with
shame
but
neither
sire
nor
dame
nor
prying
serf
shall
know
what
angel
nightly
tracks
that
waste
of
frozen
snow
what
i
love
shall
come
like
visitant
of
air
safe
in
secret
power
from
lurking
human
snare
what
loves
me
no
word
of
mine
shall
betray
though
for
faith
unstained
my
life
must
forfeit
pay
burn
then
little
lamp
glimmer
straight
and
clear
hush
a
rustling
wing
stirs
methinks
the
air
he
for
whom
i
wait
thus
ever
comes
to
me
strange
power
i
trust
thy
might
trust
thou
my
constancy
encouragement
i
do
not
weep
i
would
not
weep
our
mother
needs
no
tears
dry
thine
eyes
too
is
vain
to
keep
this
causeless
grief
for
years
what
though
her
brow
be
changed
and
cold
her
sweet
eyes
closed
for
ever
what
though
the
stone
the
darksome
mould
our
mortal
bodies
sever
what
though
her
hand
smooth
again
those
silken
locks
of
thine
nor
through
long
hours
of
future
pain
her
kind
face
thee
shine
remember
still
she
is
not
dead
she
sees
us
sister
now
laid
where
her
angel
spirit
fled
heath
and
frozen
snow
and
from
that
world
of
heavenly
light
will
she
not
always
bend
to
guide
us
in
our
lifetime
night
and
guard
us
to
the
end
thou
knowest
she
will
and
thou
mayst
mourn
that
we
are
left
below
but
not
that
she
can
return
to
share
our
earthly
woe
stanzas
often
rebuked
yet
always
back
returning
to
those
first
feelings
that
were
born
with
me
and
leaving
busy
chase
of
wealth
and
learning
for
idle
dreams
of
things
which
can
not
be
i
will
seek
not
the
shadowy
region
its
unsustaining
vastness
waxes
drear
and
visions
rising
legion
after
legion
bring
the
unreal
world
too
strangely
near
i
walk
but
not
in
old
heroic
traces
and
not
in
paths
of
high
morality
and
not
among
the
faces
the
clouded
forms
of
history
i
walk
where
my
own
nature
would
be
leading
it
vexes
me
to
choose
another
guide
where
the
grey
flocks
in
ferny
glens
are
feeding
where
the
wild
wind
blows
on
the
mountain
side
what
have
those
lonely
mountains
worth
revealing
more
glory
and
more
grief
than
i
can
tell
the
earth
that
wakes
one
human
heart
to
feeling
can
centre
both
the
worlds
of
heaven
and
hell
the
following
are
the
last
lines
my
sister
emily
ever
wrote
no
coward
soul
is
mine
no
trembler
in
the
world
sphere
i
see
heaven
glories
shine
and
faith
shines
equal
arming
me
from
fear
o
god
within
my
breast
almighty
deity
life
that
in
me
has
rest
as
i
undying
life
have
power
in
thee
vain
are
the
thousand
creeds
that
move
men
hearts
unutterably
vain
worthless
as
withered
weeds
or
idlest
froth
amid
the
boundless
main
to
waken
doubt
in
one
holding
so
fast
by
thine
infinity
so
surely
anchored
on
the
stedfast
rock
of
immortality
with
love
thy
spirit
animates
eternal
years
pervades
and
broods
above
changes
sustains
dissolves
creates
and
rears
though
earth
and
man
were
gone
and
suns
and
universes
ceased
to
be
and
thou
were
left
alone
every
existence
would
exist
in
thee
there
is
not
room
for
death
nor
atom
that
his
might
could
render
void
thou
thou
art
being
and
breath
and
what
thou
art
may
never
be
destroyed
selections
from
poems
by
acton
bell
in
looking
over
my
sister
anne
papers
i
find
mournful
evidence
that
religious
feeling
had
been
to
her
but
too
much
like
what
it
was
to
cowper
i
mean
of
course
in
a
far
milder
form
without
rendering
her
a
prey
to
those
horrors
that
defy
concealment
it
subdued
her
mood
and
bearing
to
a
perpetual
pensiveness
the
pillar
of
a
cloud
glided
constantly
before
her
eyes
she
ever
waited
at
the
foot
of
a
secret
sinai
listening
in
her
heart
to
the
voice
of
a
trumpet
sounding
long
and
waxing
louder
some
perhaps
would
rejoice
over
these
tokens
of
sincere
though
sorrowing
piety
in
a
deceased
relative
i
own
to
me
they
seem
sad
as
if
her
whole
innocent
life
had
been
passed
under
the
martyrdom
of
an
unconfessed
physical
pain
their
effect
indeed
would
be
too
distressing
were
it
not
combated
by
the
certain
knowledge
that
in
her
last
moments
this
tyranny
of
a
too
tender
conscience
was
overcome
this
pomp
of
terrors
broke
up
and
passing
away
left
her
dying
hour
unclouded
her
belief
in
god
did
not
then
bring
to
her
dread
as
of
a
stern
judge
but
hope
as
in
a
creator
and
saviour
and
no
faltering
hope
was
it
but
a
sure
and
stedfast
conviction
on
which
in
the
rude
passage
from
time
to
eternity
she
threw
the
weight
of
her
human
weakness
and
by
which
she
was
enabled
to
bear
what
was
to
be
borne
patiently
serenely
victoriously
despondency
i
have
gone
backward
in
the
work
the
labour
has
not
sped
drowsy
and
dark
my
spirit
lies
heavy
and
dull
as
lead
how
can
i
rouse
my
sinking
soul
from
such
a
lethargy
how
can
i
break
these
iron
chains
and
set
my
spirit
free
there
have
been
times
when
i
have
mourned
in
anguish
the
past
and
raised
my
suppliant
hands
on
high
while
tears
fell
thick
and
fast
and
prayed
to
have
my
sins
forgiven
with
such
a
fervent
zeal
an
earnest
grief
a
strong
desire
as
now
i
can
not
feel
and
i
have
felt
so
full
of
love
so
strong
in
spirit
then
as
if
my
heart
would
never
cool
or
wander
back
again
and
yet
alas
how
many
times
my
feet
have
gone
astray
how
oft
have
i
forgot
my
god
how
greatly
fallen
away
my
sins
increase
my
love
grows
cold
and
hope
within
me
dies
even
faith
itself
is
wavering
now
oh
how
shall
i
arise
i
can
not
weep
but
i
can
pray
then
let
me
not
despair
lord
jesus
save
me
lest
i
die
christ
hear
my
humble
prayer
a
prayer
my
god
oh
let
me
call
thee
mine
weak
wretched
sinner
though
i
be
my
trembling
soul
would
fain
be
thine
my
feeble
faith
still
clings
to
thee
not
only
for
the
past
i
grieve
the
future
fills
me
with
dismay
unless
thou
hasten
to
relieve
thy
suppliant
is
a
castaway
i
can
not
say
my
faith
is
strong
i
dare
not
hope
my
love
is
great
but
strength
and
love
to
thee
belong
oh
do
not
leave
me
desolate
i
know
i
owe
my
all
to
thee
oh
take
the
heart
i
can
not
give
do
thou
my
strength
my
saviour
be
and
make
me
to
thy
glory
live
in
memory
of
a
happy
day
in
february
blessed
be
thou
for
all
the
joy
my
soul
has
felt
oh
let
its
memory
stay
with
me
and
never
pass
away
i
was
alone
for
those
i
loved
were
far
away
from
me
the
sun
shone
on
the
withered
grass
the
wind
blew
fresh
and
free
was
it
the
smile
of
early
spring
that
made
my
bosom
glow
was
sweet
but
neither
sun
nor
wind
could
cheer
my
spirit
so
was
it
some
feeling
of
delight
all
vague
and
undefined
no
was
a
rapture
deep
and
strong
expanding
in
the
mind
was
it
a
sanguine
view
of
life
and
all
its
transient
bliss
a
hope
of
bright
prosperity
oh
no
it
was
not
this
it
was
a
glimpse
of
truth
divine
unto
my
spirit
given
illumined
by
a
ray
of
light
that
shone
direct
from
heaven
i
felt
there
was
a
god
on
high
by
whom
all
things
were
made
i
saw
his
wisdom
and
his
power
in
all
his
works
displayed
but
most
throughout
the
moral
world
i
saw
his
glory
shine
i
saw
his
wisdom
infinite
his
mercy
all
divine
deep
secrets
of
his
providence
in
darkness
long
concealed
unto
the
vision
of
my
soul
were
graciously
revealed
but
while
i
wondered
and
adored
his
majesty
divine
i
did
not
tremble
at
his
power
i
felt
that
god
was
mine
i
knew
that
my
redeemer
lived
i
did
not
fear
to
die
full
sure
that
i
should
rise
again
to
immortality
i
longed
to
view
that
bliss
divine
which
eye
hath
never
seen
like
moses
i
would
see
his
face
without
the
veil
between
confidence
oppressed
with
sin
and
woe
a
burdened
heart
i
bear
opposed
by
many
a
mighty
foe
but
i
will
not
despair
with
this
polluted
heart
i
dare
to
come
to
thee
holy
and
mighty
as
thou
art
for
thou
wilt
pardon
me
i
feel
that
i
am
weak
and
prone
to
every
sin
but
thou
who
to
those
who
seek
wilt
give
me
strength
within
far
as
this
earth
may
be
from
yonder
starry
skies
remoter
still
am
i
from
thee
yet
thou
wilt
not
despise
i
need
not
fear
my
foes
i
deed
not
yield
to
care
i
need
not
sink
beneath
my
woes
for
thou
wilt
answer
prayer
in
my
redeemer
name
i
give
myself
to
thee
and
all
unworthy
as
i
am
my
god
will
cherish
me
my
sister
anne
had
to
taste
the
cup
of
life
as
it
is
mixed
for
the
class
termed
governesses
the
following
are
some
of
the
thoughts
that
now
and
then
solace
a
governess
lines
written
from
home
though
bleak
these
woods
and
damp
the
ground
with
fallen
leaves
so
thickly
strewn
and
cold
the
wind
that
wanders
round
with
wild
and
melancholy
moan
there
is
a
friendly
roof
i
know
might
shield
me
from
the
wintry
blast
there
is
a
fire
whose
ruddy
glow
will
cheer
me
for
my
wanderings
past
and
so
though
still
i
go
cold
stranger
glances
meet
my
eye
though
when
my
spirit
sinks
in
woe
unheeded
swells
the
unbidden
sigh
though
solitude
endured
too
long
bids
youthful
joys
too
soon
decay
makes
mirth
a
stranger
to
my
tongue
and
overclouds
my
noon
of
day
when
kindly
thoughts
that
would
have
way
flow
back
discouraged
to
my
breast
i
know
there
is
though
far
away
a
home
where
heart
and
soul
may
rest
warm
hands
are
there
that
clasped
in
mine
the
warmer
heart
will
not
belie
while
mirth
and
truth
and
friendship
shine
in
smiling
lip
and
earnest
eye
the
ice
that
gathers
round
my
heart
may
there
be
thawed
and
sweetly
then
the
joys
of
youth
that
now
depart
will
come
to
cheer
my
soul
again
though
far
i
roam
that
thought
shall
be
my
hope
my
comfort
everywhere
while
such
a
home
remains
to
me
my
heart
shall
never
know
despair
the
narrow
way
believe
not
those
who
say
the
upward
path
is
smooth
lest
thou
shouldst
stumble
in
the
way
and
faint
before
the
truth
it
is
the
only
road
unto
the
realms
of
joy
but
he
who
seeks
that
blest
abode
must
all
his
powers
employ
bright
hopes
and
pure
delight
upon
his
course
may
beam
and
there
amid
the
sternest
heights
the
sweetest
flowerets
gleam
on
all
her
breezes
borne
earth
yields
no
scents
like
those
but
he
that
dares
not
gasp
the
thorn
should
never
crave
the
rose
arm
arm
thee
for
the
fight
cast
useless
loads
away
watch
through
the
darkest
hours
of
night
toil
through
the
hottest
day
crush
pride
into
the
dust
or
thou
must
needs
be
slack
and
trample
down
rebellious
lust
or
it
will
hold
thee
back
seek
not
thy
honour
here
waive
pleasure
and
renown
the
world
dread
scoff
undaunted
bear
and
face
its
deadliest
frown
to
labour
and
to
love
to
pardon
and
endure
to
lift
thy
heart
to
god
above
and
keep
thy
conscience
pure
be
this
thy
constant
aim
thy
hope
thy
chief
delight
what
matter
who
should
whisper
blame
or
who
should
scorn
or
slight
what
matter
if
thy
god
approve
and
if
within
thy
breast
thou
feel
the
comfort
of
his
love
the
earnest
of
his
rest
domestic
peace
why
should
such
gloomy
silence
reign
and
why
is
all
the
house
so
drear
when
neither
danger
sickness
pain
nor
death
nor
want
have
entered
here
we
are
as
many
as
we
were
that
other
night
when
all
were
gay
and
full
of
hope
and
free
from
care
yet
is
there
something
gone
away
the
moon
without
as
pure
and
calm
is
shining
as
that
night
she
shone
but
now
to
us
she
brings
no
balm
for
something
from
our
hearts
is
gone
something
whose
absence
leaves
a
void
a
cheerless
want
in
every
heart
each
feels
the
bliss
of
all
destroyed
and
mourns
the
change
but
each
apart
the
fire
is
burning
in
the
grate
as
redly
as
it
used
to
burn
but
still
the
hearth
is
desolate
till
mirth
and
love
and
peace
return
was
peace
that
flowed
from
heart
to
heart
with
looks
and
smiles
that
spoke
of
heaven
and
gave
us
language
to
impart
the
blissful
thoughts
itself
had
given
domestic
peace
best
joy
of
earth
when
shall
we
all
thy
value
learn
white
angel
to
our
sorrowing
hearth
return
oh
graciously
return
the
three
guides
first
published
in
fraser
magazine
spirit
of
earth
thy
hand
is
chill
i
felt
its
icy
clasp
and
shuddering
i
remember
still
that
grasp
thine
eye
bids
love
and
joy
depart
oh
turn
its
gaze
from
me
it
presses
down
my
shrinking
heart
i
will
not
walk
with
thee
wisdom
is
mine
i
heard
thee
say
beneath
my
searching
eye
all
mist
and
darkness
melt
away
phantoms
and
fables
fly
before
me
truth
can
stand
alone
the
naked
solid
truth
and
man
matured
by
worth
will
own
if
i
am
shunned
by
youth
firm
is
my
tread
and
sure
though
slow
my
footsteps
never
slide
and
he
that
follows
me
shall
know
i
am
the
surest
guide
thy
boast
is
vain
but
were
it
true
that
thou
couldst
safely
steer
life
rough
and
devious
pathway
through
such
guidance
i
should
fear
how
could
i
bear
to
walk
for
aye
with
eyes
to
earthward
prone
trampled
weeds
and
miry
clay
and
sand
and
flinty
stone
never
the
glorious
view
to
greet
of
hill
and
dale
and
sky
to
see
that
nature
charms
are
sweet
or
feel
that
heaven
is
nigh
if
in
my
heart
arose
a
spring
a
gush
of
thought
divine
at
once
stagnation
thou
wouldst
bring
with
that
cold
touch
of
thine
if
glancing
up
i
sought
to
snatch
but
one
glimpse
of
the
sky
my
baffled
gaze
would
only
catch
thy
heartless
cold
grey
eye
if
to
the
breezes
wandering
near
i
listened
eagerly
and
deemed
an
angel
tongue
to
hear
that
whispered
hope
to
me
that
heavenly
music
would
be
drowned
in
thy
harsh
droning
voice
nor
inward
thought
nor
sight
nor
sound
might
my
sad
soul
rejoice
dull
is
thine
ear
unheard
by
thee
the
still
small
voice
of
heaven
thine
eyes
are
dim
and
can
not
see
the
helps
that
god
has
given
there
is
a
bridge
every
flood
which
thou
canst
not
perceive
a
path
through
every
tangled
wood
but
thou
wilt
not
believe
striving
to
make
thy
way
by
force
and
fell
the
tree
that
checks
thy
course
and
burst
through
brier
and
thorn
and
pausing
by
the
river
side
poor
reasoner
thou
wilt
deem
by
casting
pebbles
in
its
tide
to
cross
the
swelling
stream
right
through
the
flinty
rock
try
thy
toilsome
way
to
bore
regardless
of
the
pathway
nigh
that
would
conduct
thee
not
only
art
thou
then
unkind
and
freezing
cold
to
me
but
unbelieving
deaf
and
blind
i
will
not
walk
with
thee
spirit
of
pride
thy
wings
are
strong
thine
eyes
like
lightning
shine
ecstatic
joys
to
thee
belong
and
powers
almost
divine
but
is
a
false
destructive
blaze
within
those
eyes
i
see
turn
hence
their
fascinating
gaze
i
will
not
follow
thee
coward
and
fool
thou
mayst
reply
walk
on
the
common
sod
go
trace
with
timid
foot
and
eye
the
steps
by
others
trod
is
best
the
beaten
path
to
keep
the
ancient
faith
to
hold
to
pasture
with
thy
and
lie
within
the
fold
cling
to
the
earth
poor
grovelling
worm
is
not
for
thee
to
soar
against
the
fury
of
the
storm
amid
the
thunder
roar
there
glory
in
that
daring
strife
unknown
undreamt
by
thee
there
speechless
rapture
in
the
life
of
those
who
follow
me
yes
i
have
seen
thy
votaries
oft
upheld
by
thee
their
guide
in
strength
and
courage
mount
aloft
the
steepy
i
seen
them
stand
against
the
sky
and
gazing
from
below
beheld
thy
lightning
in
their
eye
thy
triumph
on
their
brow
oh
i
have
felt
what
glory
then
what
transport
must
be
theirs
so
far
above
their
above
their
toils
and
cares
inhaling
nature
purest
breath
her
riches
round
them
spread
the
wide
expanse
of
earth
beneath
heaven
glories
overhead
but
i
have
seen
them
helpless
down
to
a
bloody
grave
and
still
thy
ruthless
eye
has
flash
thy
strong
hand
did
not
save
i
seen
some
the
mountain
brow
sustain
awhile
by
thee
rocks
of
ice
and
hills
of
snow
bound
fearless
wild
and
free
bold
and
exultant
was
their
mien
while
thou
didst
cheer
them
on
but
evening
fell
and
then
i
ween
their
faithless
guide
was
gone
alas
how
fared
thy
favourites
then
lone
helpless
weary
cold
did
ever
wanderer
find
again
the
path
he
left
of
old
where
is
their
glory
where
the
pride
that
swelled
their
hearts
before
where
now
the
courage
that
defied
the
mightiest
tempest
roar
what
shall
they
do
when
night
grows
black
when
angry
storms
arise
who
now
will
lead
them
to
the
track
thou
them
to
despise
spirit
of
pride
it
needs
not
this
to
make
me
shun
thy
wiles
renounce
thy
triumph
and
thy
bliss
thy
honours
and
thy
smiles
bright
as
thou
art
and
bold
and
strong
that
fierce
glance
wins
not
me
and
i
abhor
thy
scoffing
tongue
i
will
not
follow
thee
spirit
of
faith
be
thou
my
guide
o
clasp
my
hand
in
thine
and
let
me
never
quit
thy
side
thy
comforts
are
divine
earth
calls
thee
blind
misguided
one
but
who
can
shew
like
thee
forgotten
things
that
have
been
done
and
things
that
are
to
be
secrets
conceal
from
nature
ken
who
like
thee
can
declare
or
who
like
thee
to
erring
men
god
holy
will
can
bear
pride
scorns
thee
for
thy
lowly
mien
but
who
like
thee
can
rise
above
this
toilsome
sordid
scene
beyond
the
holy
skies
meek
is
thine
eye
and
soft
thy
voice
but
wondrous
is
thy
might
to
make
the
wretched
soul
rejoice
to
give
the
simple
light
and
still
to
all
that
seek
thy
way
this
magic
power
is
given
while
their
footsteps
press
the
clay
their
souls
ascend
to
heaven
danger
surrounds
them
pain
and
woe
their
portion
here
must
be
but
only
they
that
trust
thee
know
what
comfort
dwells
with
thee
strength
to
sustain
their
drooping
and
vigour
to
defend
thou
of
my
darkest
hours
affliction
firmest
friend
day
does
not
always
mark
our
way
night
shadows
oft
appal
but
lead
me
and
i
can
not
stray
hold
me
i
shall
not
fall
sustain
me
i
shall
never
faint
how
rough
may
be
my
upward
road
nor
moan
nor
plaint
shall
mar
my
trust
in
thee
narrow
the
path
by
which
we
go
and
oft
it
turns
aside
from
pleasant
meads
where
roses
blow
and
peaceful
waters
glide
where
flowery
turf
lies
green
and
soft
and
gentle
gales
are
sweet
to
where
dark
mountains
frown
aloft
hard
rocks
distress
the
feet
deserts
beyond
lie
bleak
and
bare
and
keen
winds
round
us
blow
but
if
thy
hand
conducts
me
there
the
way
is
right
i
know
i
have
no
wish
to
turn
away
my
spirit
does
not
quail
how
can
it
while
i
hear
thee
say
press
forward
and
prevail
even
above
the
tempest
swell
i
hear
thy
voice
of
love
of
hope
and
peace
i
hear
thee
tell
and
that
blest
home
above
through
pain
and
death
i
can
rejoice
if
but
thy
strength
be
mine
earth
hath
no
music
like
thy
voice
life
owns
no
joy
like
thine
spirit
of
faith
i
go
with
thee
thou
if
i
hold
thee
fast
wilt
guide
defend
and
strengthen
me
and
bear
me
home
at
last
by
thy
help
all
things
i
can
do
in
thy
strength
all
things
bear
teach
me
for
thou
art
just
and
true
smile
on
me
thou
art
fair
i
have
given
the
last
memento
of
my
sister
emily
this
is
the
last
of
my
sister
anne
i
hoped
that
with
the
brave
and
strong
my
portioned
task
might
lie
to
toil
amid
the
busy
throng
with
purpose
pure
and
high
but
god
has
fixed
another
part
and
he
has
fixed
it
well
i
said
so
with
my
bleeding
heart
when
first
the
anguish
fell
thou
god
hast
taken
our
delight
our
treasured
hope
away
thou
us
now
weep
through
the
night
and
sorrow
through
the
day
these
weary
hours
will
not
be
lost
these
days
of
misery
these
nights
of
darkness
can
i
but
turn
to
thee
with
secret
labour
to
sustain
in
humble
patience
every
blow
to
gather
fortitude
from
pain
and
hope
and
holiness
from
woe
thus
let
me
serve
thee
from
my
heart
may
be
my
written
fate
whether
thus
early
to
depart
or
yet
a
while
to
wait
if
thou
shouldst
bring
me
back
to
life
more
humbled
i
should
be
more
wise
more
strengthened
for
the
strife
more
apt
to
lean
on
thee
should
death
be
standing
at
the
gate
thus
should
i
keep
my
vow
but
lord
whatever
be
my
fate
oh
let
me
serve
thee
now
these
lines
written
the
desk
was
closed
the
pen
laid
aside
for
ever
