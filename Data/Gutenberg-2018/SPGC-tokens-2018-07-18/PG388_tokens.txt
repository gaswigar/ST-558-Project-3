an
episode
in
the
life
of
a
man
afterword
the
crossing
book
i
the
borderland
chapter
i
the
blue
wall
i
was
born
under
the
blue
ridge
and
under
that
side
which
is
blue
in
the
evening
light
in
a
wild
land
of
game
and
forest
and
rushing
waters
there
on
the
borders
of
a
creek
that
runs
into
the
yadkin
river
in
a
cabin
that
was
chinked
with
red
mud
i
came
into
the
world
a
subject
of
king
george
the
third
in
that
part
of
his
realm
known
as
the
province
of
north
carolina
the
cabin
reeked
of
and
bacon
and
the
odor
of
pelts
it
had
two
shakedowns
on
one
of
which
i
slept
under
a
bearskin
a
rough
stone
chimney
was
reared
outside
and
the
fireplace
was
as
long
as
my
father
was
tall
there
was
a
crane
in
it
and
a
bake
kettle
and
over
it
great
buckhorns
held
my
father
s
rifle
when
it
was
not
in
use
on
other
horns
hung
jerked
bear
s
meat
and
venison
hams
and
gourds
for
drinking
cups
and
bags
of
seed
and
my
father
s
best
hunting
shirt
also
in
a
neglected
corner
several
articles
of
woman
s
attire
from
pegs
these
once
belonged
to
my
mother
among
them
was
a
gown
of
silk
of
a
fine
faded
pattern
over
which
i
was
wont
to
speculate
the
women
at
the
twelve
miles
away
were
dressed
in
coarse
butternut
wool
and
huge
sunbonnets
but
when
i
questioned
my
father
on
these
matters
he
would
give
me
no
answers
my
father
was
how
shall
i
say
what
he
was
to
this
day
i
can
only
surmise
many
things
of
him
he
was
a
scotchman
born
and
i
know
now
that
he
had
a
slight
scotch
accent
at
the
time
of
which
i
write
my
early
childhood
he
was
a
frontiersman
and
hunter
i
can
see
him
now
with
his
hunting
shirt
and
leggings
and
moccasins
his
powder
horn
engraved
with
wondrous
scenes
his
bullet
pouch
and
tomahawk
and
hunting
knife
he
was
a
tall
lean
man
with
a
strange
sad
face
and
he
talked
little
save
when
he
drank
too
many
horns
as
they
were
called
in
that
country
these
lapses
of
my
father
s
were
a
perpetual
source
of
wonder
to
me
and
i
must
say
of
delight
they
occurred
only
when
a
passing
traveller
who
hit
his
fancy
chanced
that
way
or
what
was
almost
as
rare
a
neighbor
many
a
winter
night
i
have
lain
awake
under
the
skins
listening
to
a
flow
of
language
that
held
me
spellbound
though
i
understood
scarce
a
word
of
it
virtuous
and
vicious
every
man
must
be
few
in
the
extreme
but
all
in
a
the
chance
neighbor
or
traveller
was
no
less
struck
with
wonder
and
many
the
time
have
i
heard
the
query
at
the
and
elsewhere
whar
alec
trimble
got
his
larnin
the
truth
is
my
father
was
an
object
of
suspicion
to
the
frontiersmen
even
as
a
child
i
knew
this
and
resented
it
he
had
brought
me
up
in
solitude
and
i
was
old
for
my
age
learned
in
some
things
far
beyond
my
years
and
ignorant
of
others
i
should
have
known
i
loved
the
man
passionately
in
the
long
winter
evenings
when
the
howl
of
wolves
and
painters
rose
as
the
wind
lulled
he
taught
me
to
read
from
the
bible
and
the
pilgrim
s
i
can
see
his
long
slim
fingers
on
the
page
they
seemed
but
ill
fitted
for
the
life
he
led
the
love
of
rhythmic
language
was
somehow
born
into
me
and
many
s
the
time
i
have
held
watch
in
the
cabin
day
and
night
while
my
father
was
away
on
his
hunts
spelling
out
the
verses
that
have
since
become
part
of
my
life
as
i
grew
older
i
went
with
him
into
the
mountains
often
on
his
back
and
spent
the
nights
in
open
camp
with
my
little
moccasins
drying
at
the
blaze
so
i
learned
to
skin
a
bear
and
fleece
off
the
fat
for
oil
with
my
hunting
knife
and
cure
a
deerskin
and
follow
a
trail
at
seven
i
even
shot
the
long
rifle
with
a
rest
i
learned
to
endure
cold
and
hunger
and
fatigue
and
to
walk
in
silence
over
the
mountains
my
father
never
saying
a
word
for
days
at
a
spell
and
often
when
he
opened
his
mouth
it
would
be
to
recite
a
verse
of
pope
s
in
a
way
that
moved
me
strangely
for
a
poem
is
not
a
poem
unless
it
be
well
spoken
in
the
hot
days
of
summer
over
against
the
dark
forest
the
bright
green
of
our
little
patch
of
indian
corn
rippled
in
the
wind
and
towards
night
i
would
often
sit
watching
the
deep
blue
of
the
mountain
wall
and
dream
of
the
mysteries
of
the
land
that
lay
beyond
and
by
chance
one
evening
as
i
sat
thus
my
father
reading
in
the
twilight
a
man
stood
before
us
so
silently
had
he
come
up
the
path
leading
from
the
brook
that
we
had
not
heard
him
presently
my
father
looked
up
from
his
book
but
did
not
rise
as
for
me
i
had
been
staring
for
some
time
in
astonishment
for
he
was
a
man
than
i
had
ever
seen
he
wore
a
deerskin
hunting
shirt
dyed
black
but
in
place
of
a
coonskin
cap
with
the
tail
hanging
down
a
hat
his
long
rifle
rested
on
the
ground
and
he
held
a
roan
horse
by
the
bridle
howdy
neighbor
said
he
i
recall
a
fear
that
my
father
would
not
fancy
him
in
such
cases
he
would
give
a
stranger
food
and
leave
him
to
himself
my
father
s
whims
were
past
understanding
but
he
got
up
good
evening
said
he
the
visitor
looked
a
little
surprised
as
i
had
seen
many
do
at
my
father
s
accent
neighbor
said
he
kin
you
keep
me
over
night
come
in
said
my
father
we
sat
down
to
our
supper
of
corn
and
beans
and
venison
of
all
of
which
our
guest
ate
sparingly
he
too
was
a
silent
man
and
scarcely
a
word
was
spoken
during
the
meal
several
times
he
looked
at
me
with
such
a
kindly
expression
in
his
blue
eyes
a
trace
of
a
smile
around
his
broad
mouth
that
i
wished
he
might
stay
with
us
always
but
once
when
my
father
said
something
about
indians
the
eyes
grew
hard
as
flint
it
was
then
i
remarked
with
a
boy
s
wonder
that
despite
his
dark
hair
he
had
yellow
eyebrows
after
supper
the
two
men
sat
on
the
log
step
while
i
set
about
the
task
of
skinning
the
deer
my
father
had
shot
that
day
presently
i
felt
a
heavy
hand
on
my
shoulder
what
s
your
name
lad
he
said
i
told
him
davy
davy
i
ll
larn
ye
a
trick
worth
a
little
time
said
he
whipping
out
a
knife
in
a
trice
the
red
carcass
hung
between
the
forked
stakes
while
i
stood
with
my
mouth
open
he
turned
to
me
and
laughed
gently
some
day
you
ll
cross
the
mountains
and
skin
twenty
of
an
evening
he
said
ye
ll
make
a
woodsman
sure
you
ve
got
the
eye
and
the
this
little
piece
of
praise
from
him
made
me
hot
all
over
game
rare
said
he
to
my
father
none
sae
good
now
said
my
father
i
reckon
not
my
cabin
s
on
beaver
creek
some
forty
mile
above
and
game
s
going
there
settlements
said
my
father
but
presently
after
a
few
whiffs
of
his
pipe
he
added
i
hear
fine
things
of
this
land
across
the
mountains
that
the
indians
call
the
dark
and
bluidy
and
well
named
said
the
stranger
but
a
brave
country
said
my
father
and
all
tramped
down
with
game
i
hear
that
daniel
boone
and
others
have
gone
into
it
and
come
back
with
marvellous
tales
they
tell
me
boone
was
there
alone
three
months
he
s
saething
of
a
man
d
ye
ken
him
the
ruddy
face
of
the
stranger
grew
ruddier
still
my
name
s
boone
he
said
what
cried
my
father
it
wouldn
t
be
daniel
you
ve
guessed
it
i
my
father
rose
without
a
word
went
into
the
cabin
and
immediately
reappeared
with
a
flask
and
a
couple
of
gourds
one
of
which
he
handed
to
our
visitor
tell
me
aboot
it
said
he
that
was
the
fairy
tale
of
my
childhood
far
into
the
night
i
lay
on
the
dewy
grass
listening
to
boone
s
talk
it
did
not
at
first
flow
in
a
steady
stream
for
he
was
not
a
garrulous
man
but
my
father
s
questions
presently
fired
his
enthusiasm
i
recall
but
little
of
it
being
so
small
a
lad
but
i
crept
closer
and
closer
until
i
could
touch
this
superior
being
who
had
been
beyond
the
wall
marco
polo
was
no
greater
wonder
to
the
venetians
than
boone
to
me
he
spoke
of
leaving
wife
and
children
and
setting
out
for
the
unknown
with
other
woodsmen
he
told
how
crossing
over
our
blue
western
wall
into
a
valley
beyond
they
found
a
warrior
s
path
through
a
gap
across
another
range
and
so
down
into
the
fairest
of
promised
lands
and
as
he
talked
he
lost
himself
in
the
tale
of
it
and
the
very
quality
of
his
voice
changed
he
told
of
a
land
of
wooded
hill
and
pleasant
vale
of
clear
water
running
over
limestone
down
to
the
great
river
beyond
the
ohio
a
land
of
glades
the
fields
of
which
were
pied
with
flowers
of
wondrous
beauty
where
roamed
the
buffalo
in
countless
thousands
where
elk
and
deer
abounded
and
turkeys
and
feathered
game
and
bear
in
the
tall
brakes
of
cane
and
simply
he
told
how
when
the
others
had
left
him
he
stayed
for
three
months
roaming
the
hills
alone
with
nature
herself
but
did
you
no
meet
the
indians
asked
my
father
i
seed
one
fishing
on
a
log
once
said
our
visitor
laughing
but
he
fell
into
the
water
i
reckon
he
was
my
father
nodded
comprehendingly
even
admiringly
and
again
said
he
wal
said
boone
we
fell
in
with
a
war
party
of
shawnees
going
back
to
their
lands
north
of
the
great
river
the
critters
took
away
all
we
had
it
was
hard
he
added
reflectively
i
had
staked
my
fortune
on
the
venter
and
we
d
got
enough
skins
to
make
us
rich
but
neighbor
there
is
land
enough
for
you
and
me
as
black
and
rich
as
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
said
my
father
lapsing
into
verse
the
lord
is
my
shepherd
i
shall
not
want
he
leadeth
me
into
green
pastures
and
beside
still
for
a
time
they
were
silent
each
wrapped
in
his
own
thought
while
the
crickets
chirped
and
the
frogs
sang
from
the
distant
forest
came
the
mournful
hoot
of
an
owl
and
you
are
going
back
asked
my
father
presently
aye
that
i
am
there
are
many
families
on
the
yadkin
below
going
too
and
you
neighbor
you
might
come
with
us
davy
is
the
boy
that
would
thrive
in
that
my
father
did
not
answer
it
was
late
indeed
when
we
lay
down
to
rest
and
the
night
i
spent
between
waking
and
dreaming
of
the
wonderland
beyond
the
mountains
hoping
against
hope
that
my
father
would
go
the
sun
was
just
flooding
the
slopes
when
our
guest
arose
to
leave
and
my
father
bade
him
with
a
heartiness
that
was
rare
to
him
but
to
my
bitter
regret
neither
spoke
of
my
father
s
going
being
a
man
of
understanding
boone
knew
it
were
little
use
to
press
he
patted
me
on
the
head
you
re
a
wise
lad
davy
said
he
i
hope
we
shall
meet
he
mounted
his
roan
and
rode
away
down
the
slope
waving
his
hand
to
us
and
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
went
to
feed
our
white
mare
whinnying
for
food
in
the
chapter
ii
wars
and
rumors
of
wars
and
so
our
life
went
on
the
same
but
yet
not
the
same
for
i
had
the
land
of
promise
to
dream
of
and
as
i
went
about
my
tasks
i
conjured
up
in
my
mind
pictures
of
its
beauty
you
will
forgive
a
backwoods
boy
for
lack
of
wider
interest
and
with
a
little
imagination
bear
hunting
with
my
father
and
an
occasional
trip
on
the
white
mare
twelve
miles
to
the
for
salt
and
other
necessaries
were
the
only
diversions
to
break
the
routine
of
my
days
but
at
the
too
they
were
talking
of
kaintuckee
for
so
the
land
was
called
the
dark
and
bloody
ground
the
next
year
came
a
war
on
the
frontier
waged
by
lord
dunmore
governor
of
virginia
of
this
likewise
i
heard
at
the
though
few
from
our
part
seemed
to
have
gone
to
it
and
i
heard
there
for
rumors
spread
over
mountains
that
men
blazing
in
the
new
land
were
in
danger
and
that
my
hero
boone
was
gone
out
to
save
them
but
in
the
autumn
came
tidings
of
a
great
battle
far
to
the
north
and
of
the
indians
suing
for
peace
the
next
year
came
more
tidings
of
a
sort
i
did
not
understand
i
remember
once
bringing
back
from
the
a
crumpled
newspaper
which
my
father
read
again
and
again
and
then
folded
up
and
put
in
his
pocket
he
said
nothing
to
me
of
these
things
but
the
next
time
i
went
to
the
the
woman
asked
me
is
your
pa
for
the
congress
what
s
that
said
i
i
reckon
he
ain
t
said
the
woman
tartly
i
recall
her
dimly
a
slattern
creature
in
a
loose
gown
and
bare
feet
wife
of
the
storekeeper
and
wagoner
with
a
swarm
of
urchins
about
her
they
were
all
very
natural
to
me
thus
and
i
remember
a
battle
with
one
of
these
urchins
in
the
briers
an
affair
which
did
not
add
to
the
love
of
their
family
for
ours
there
was
no
money
in
that
country
and
the
store
took
our
pelts
in
exchange
for
what
we
needed
from
civilization
once
a
month
would
i
load
these
pelts
on
the
white
mare
and
make
the
journey
by
the
path
down
the
creek
at
times
i
met
other
settlers
there
some
of
them
not
long
from
ireland
with
the
brogue
still
in
their
mouths
and
again
i
saw
the
wagoner
with
his
great
wagon
standing
at
the
door
ready
to
start
for
the
town
sixty
miles
away
twas
he
brought
the
news
of
this
latest
war
one
day
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
wagoner
riding
up
the
path
to
our
cabin
crying
out
for
my
father
for
he
was
a
violent
man
and
a
violent
scene
followed
they
remained
for
a
long
time
within
the
house
and
when
they
came
out
the
wagoner
s
face
was
red
with
rage
my
father
too
was
angry
but
no
more
talkative
than
usual
ye
say
ye
ll
not
help
the
congress
shouted
the
wagoner
i
ll
not
said
my
father
ye
ll
live
to
rue
this
day
alec
trimble
cried
the
man
ye
may
think
ye
re
too
fine
for
the
likes
of
us
but
there
s
them
in
the
settlement
that
knows
about
with
that
he
flung
himself
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
but
the
next
time
i
went
to
the
the
woman
drove
me
away
with
curses
and
called
me
an
aristocrat
wearily
i
tramped
back
the
dozen
miles
up
the
creek
beside
the
mare
carrying
my
pelts
with
me
stumbling
on
the
stones
and
scratched
by
the
dry
briers
for
it
was
autumn
the
woods
all
red
and
yellow
against
the
green
of
the
pines
i
sat
down
beside
the
old
beaver
dam
to
gather
courage
to
tell
my
father
but
he
only
smiled
bitterly
when
he
heard
it
nor
would
he
tell
me
what
the
word
aristocrat
meant
that
winter
we
spent
without
bacon
and
our
salt
gave
out
at
christmas
it
was
at
this
season
if
i
remember
rightly
that
we
had
another
visitor
he
arrived
about
nightfall
one
gray
day
his
horse
jaded
and
cut
and
he
was
dressed
all
in
wool
with
a
great
coat
wrapped
about
him
and
high
boots
this
made
me
stare
at
him
when
my
father
drew
back
the
bolt
of
the
door
he
too
stared
and
fell
back
a
step
come
in
said
he
d
ye
ken
me
alec
said
the
man
he
was
a
tall
spare
man
like
my
father
a
scotchman
but
his
hair
was
in
a
cue
come
in
duncan
said
my
father
quietly
davy
run
out
for
loath
as
i
was
to
go
i
obeyed
as
i
came
back
dragging
a
log
behind
me
i
heard
them
in
argument
and
in
their
talk
there
was
much
about
the
congress
and
a
woman
named
flora
macdonald
and
a
british
fleet
sailing
southward
we
ll
have
two
thousand
highlanders
and
more
to
meet
the
fleet
and
ye
ll
sit
at
hame
in
this
hovel
ye
ve
made
yeresel
and
he
glanced
about
disdainfully
and
no
help
the
king
he
brought
his
fist
down
on
the
pine
boards
ye
did
no
help
the
king
greatly
at
culloden
duncan
said
my
father
dryly
our
visitor
did
not
answer
at
once
the
yankee
rebels
ll
no
help
the
house
of
stuart
said
he
presently
and
hanover
s
coom
to
stay
are
ye
too
a
rebel
alec
ritchie
i
remember
wondering
why
he
said
ritchie
i
ll
no
take
a
hand
in
this
fight
answered
my
father
and
that
was
the
end
of
it
the
man
left
with
scant
ceremony
i
guiding
him
down
the
creek
to
the
main
trail
he
did
not
open
his
mouth
until
i
parted
with
him
puir
davy
said
he
and
rode
away
in
the
night
for
the
moon
shone
through
the
clouds
i
remember
these
things
i
suppose
because
i
had
nothing
else
to
think
about
and
the
names
stuck
in
my
memory
intensified
by
later
events
until
i
began
to
write
a
diary
and
now
i
come
to
my
travels
as
the
spring
drew
on
i
had
had
a
feeling
that
we
could
not
live
thus
forever
with
no
market
for
our
pelts
and
one
day
my
father
said
to
me
abruptly
davy
we
ll
be
where
i
asked
ye
ll
ken
soon
enough
said
he
we
ll
go
at
crack
o
we
went
away
in
the
wild
dawn
leaving
the
cabin
desolate
we
loaded
the
white
mare
with
the
pelts
and
my
father
wore
a
woollen
suit
like
that
of
our
scotch
visitor
which
i
had
never
seen
before
he
had
clubbed
his
hair
but
strangest
of
all
he
carried
in
a
small
parcel
the
silk
gown
that
had
been
my
mother
s
we
had
scant
other
baggage
we
crossed
the
yadkin
at
a
ford
and
climbing
the
hills
to
the
south
of
it
we
went
down
over
stony
traces
down
and
down
through
rain
and
sun
stopping
at
rude
cabins
or
taverns
until
we
came
into
the
valley
of
another
river
this
i
know
now
was
the
catawba
my
memories
of
that
ride
are
as
misty
as
the
spring
weather
in
the
mountains
but
presently
the
country
began
to
open
up
into
broad
fields
some
of
these
abandoned
to
pines
and
at
last
splashing
through
the
stiff
red
clay
that
was
up
to
the
mare
s
fetlocks
we
came
to
a
place
called
charlotte
town
what
a
day
that
was
for
me
and
how
i
gaped
at
the
houses
there
finer
than
any
i
had
ever
dreamed
of
that
was
my
first
sight
of
a
town
and
how
i
listened
to
the
gentlemen
at
the
tavern
one
i
recall
had
a
fighting
head
with
a
lock
awry
and
a
negro
servant
to
wait
on
him
and
was
the
principal
spokesman
he
too
was
talking
of
war
the
cherokees
had
risen
on
the
western
border
he
was
telling
of
the
massacre
of
a
settlement
in
no
mild
language
sirs
he
cried
the
british
have
stirred
the
redskins
to
this
will
you
sit
here
while
women
and
children
are
scalped
and
those
devils
he
called
them
worse
names
stuart
and
cameron
go
unpunished
my
father
got
up
from
the
corner
where
he
sat
and
stood
beside
the
man
i
ken
alec
cameron
said
he
the
man
looked
at
him
with
amazement
ay
said
he
i
shouldn
t
think
you
d
own
it
damn
him
he
cried
if
we
catch
him
we
ll
skin
him
i
ken
cameron
my
father
repeated
and
i
ll
gang
with
you
to
skin
him
the
man
seized
his
hand
and
wrung
it
but
first
i
must
be
in
charlestown
said
my
father
the
next
morning
we
sold
our
pelts
and
though
the
mare
was
tired
we
pushed
southward
i
behind
the
saddle
i
had
much
to
think
about
wondering
what
was
to
become
of
me
while
my
father
went
to
skin
cameron
i
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
he
would
do
it
the
world
is
a
storybook
to
a
lad
of
nine
and
the
thought
of
charlestown
filled
me
with
a
delight
unspeakable
perchance
he
would
leave
me
in
charlestown
at
nightfall
we
came
into
a
settlement
called
the
waxhaws
and
there
being
no
tavern
there
and
the
mare
being
very
jaded
and
the
roads
heavy
we
cast
about
for
a
place
to
sleep
the
sunlight
slanting
over
the
pine
forest
glistened
on
the
pools
in
the
wet
fields
and
it
so
chanced
that
splashing
across
these
swinging
a
over
his
head
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
was
a
lad
of
my
own
age
my
father
hailed
him
and
he
came
running
towards
us
still
shouting
and
vaulted
the
rails
he
stood
before
us
eying
me
with
a
most
mischievous
look
in
his
blue
eyes
and
dabbling
in
the
red
mud
with
his
toes
i
remember
i
thought
him
a
boy
he
was
lanky
and
he
had
a
very
long
face
under
his
tousled
hair
my
father
asked
him
where
he
could
spend
the
night
wal
said
the
boy
i
reckon
uncle
crawford
might
take
you
in
and
again
he
mightn
he
ran
ahead
still
swinging
the
pail
and
we
following
came
at
length
to
a
farmhouse
as
we
stopped
at
the
doorway
a
stout
motherly
woman
filled
it
she
held
her
knitting
in
her
hand
you
andy
she
cried
have
you
fetched
the
milk
andy
tried
to
look
repentant
i
declare
i
ll
tan
you
said
the
lady
git
out
this
instant
what
rascality
have
you
been
in
i
fetched
home
visitors
ma
said
andy
visitors
cried
the
lady
what
ll
your
uncle
crawford
say
and
she
looked
at
us
smiling
but
with
no
great
hostility
pardon
me
madam
said
my
father
if
we
seem
to
intrude
but
my
mare
is
tired
and
we
have
nowhere
to
uncle
crawford
did
take
us
in
he
was
a
man
of
substance
in
that
country
a
north
of
ireland
man
by
birth
if
i
remember
right
i
went
to
bed
with
the
boy
whose
name
was
andy
jackson
i
remember
that
his
mother
came
into
our
little
room
under
the
eaves
and
made
andy
say
his
prayers
and
me
after
him
but
when
she
was
gone
out
andy
stumped
his
toe
getting
into
bed
in
the
dark
and
swore
with
a
brilliancy
and
vehemence
that
astonished
me
it
was
some
hours
before
we
went
to
sleep
he
plying
me
with
questions
about
my
life
which
seemed
to
interest
him
greatly
and
i
returning
in
kind
my
pa
s
dead
said
andy
he
came
from
a
part
of
ireland
where
they
are
all
weavers
we
re
kinder
poor
relations
here
aunt
crawford
s
sick
and
ma
keeps
house
but
uncle
crawford
s
good
an
lets
me
go
to
charlotte
town
with
him
i
recall
that
he
also
boasted
some
about
his
big
brothers
who
were
away
just
then
andy
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
to
see
us
start
but
we
didn
t
start
because
crawford
insisted
that
the
white
mare
should
have
a
half
day
s
rest
andy
being
hustled
off
unwillingly
to
the
old
field
school
made
me
go
with
him
he
was
a
very
headstrong
boy
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
a
school
this
one
was
only
a
log
house
in
a
poor
piny
place
with
a
rabble
of
boys
and
girls
romping
at
the
door
but
when
they
saw
us
they
stopped
andy
jumped
into
the
air
let
out
a
and
flung
himself
into
the
midst
scattering
them
right
and
left
and
knocking
one
boy
over
and
over
i
m
billy
buck
he
cried
i
m
a
hull
regiment
o
rangers
let
th
cherokees

andy
cried
the
boys
where

new

said
andy
and
his
pa
s
goin
to
fight
the
cherokees
he
kin
lick
tarnation
out
n
any
o
meanwhile
i
held
back
never
having
been
thrown
with
so
many
of
my
own
kind
he
s
shot
painters
and
b
ars
said
andy
an
skinned
em
kin
you

him
smally
i
reckon
now
i
had
not
come
to
the
school
for
fighting
so
i
held
back
fortunately
for
me
smally
held
back
also
but
he
tried
skilful
tactics
he
kin
throw
you
andy
faced
me
in
an
instant
kin
you
said
he
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
try
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
rolling
on
the
ground
to
the
huge
delight
of
smally
and
the
others
andy
shouting
all
the
while
and
swearing
we
rolled
and
rolled
and
rolled
in
the
mud
until
we
both
lost
our
breath
and
even
andy
stopped
swearing
for
want
of
it
after
a
while
the
boys
were
silent
and
the
thing
became
grim
earnest
at
length
by
some
accident
rather
than
my
own
strength
both
his
shoulders
touched
the
ground
i
released
him
but
he
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
and
at
me
again
like
a
wildcat
andy
won
t
stay
throwed
shouted
a
boy
and
before
i
knew
it
he
had
my
shoulders
down
in
a
puddle
then
i
went
for
him
and
affairs
were
growing
more
serious
than
a
wrestle
when
smally
fancying
himself
safe
and
no
doubt
having
a
grudge
shouted
out
tell
him
he
slobbers
andy
did
slobber
but
that
was
the
end
of
me
and
the
beginning
of
smally
andy
left
me
instantly
not
without
an
intimation
that
he
would
come
back
and
proceeded
to
cover
smally
with
red
clay
and
blood
however
in
the
midst
of
this
turmoil
the
schoolmaster
arrived
haled
both
into
the
schoolhouse
held
court
and
flogged
andrew
with
considerable
gusto
he
pronounced
these
words
afterwards
with
great
solemnity
andrew
jackson
if
i
catch
ye
fightin
once
more
i
ll
be
afther
givin
ye
lave
to
lave
the
i
parted
from
andy
at
noon
with
real
regret
he
was
the
first
boy
with
whom
i
had
ever
had
any
intimacy
and
i
admired
him
chiefly
i
fear
for
his
fluent
use
of
profanity
and
his
fighting
qualities
he
was
a
merry
lad
with
a
wondrous
quick
temper
but
a
good
heart
and
he
seemed
sorry
to
say
he
filled
my
pockets
with
june
apples
unripe
by
the
way
and
told
me
to
remember
him
when
i
got
till
charlestown
i
remembered
him
much
longer
than
that
and
usually
with
a
shock
of
surprise
chapter
iii
charlestown
down
and
down
we
went
crossing
great
rivers
by
ford
and
ferry
until
the
hills
flattened
themselves
and
the
country
became
a
long
stretch
of
level
broken
by
the
forests
only
and
i
saw
many
things
i
had
not
thought
were
on
the
earth
once
in
a
while
i
caught
glimpses
of
great
red
houses
with
stately
pillars
among
the
trees
they
put
me
in
mind
of
the
palaces
in
bunyan
their
windows
all
golden
in
the
morning
sun
and
as
we
jogged
ahead
i
pondered
on
the
delights
within
them
i
saw
gangs
of
negroes
plodding
to
work
along
the
road
an
overseer
riding
behind
them
with
his
gun
on
his
back
and
there
were
whole
cotton
fields
in
these
domains
blazing
in
primrose
flower
a
new
plant
here
so
my
father
said
he
was
willing
to
talk
on
such
subjects
but
on
others
and
especially
our
errand
to
charlestown
he
would
say
nothing
and
i
knew
better
than
to
press
him
one
day
as
we
were
crossing
a
dike
between
rice
swamps
spread
with
delicate
green
i
saw
the
white
tops
of
wagons
flashing
in
the
sun
at
the
far
end
of
it
we
caught
up
with
them
the
wagoners
cracking
their
whips
and
swearing
at
the
straining
horses
and
lo
in
front
of
the
wagons
was
an
army
at
least
my
boyish
mind
magnified
it
to
such
men
clad
in
homespun
perspiring
and
spattered
with
mud
were
straggling
along
the
road
by
fours
laughing
and
joking
together
the
officers
rode
and
many
of
these
had
blue
coats
and
buff
waistcoats
some
the
worse
for
wear
my
father
was
pushing
the
white
mare
into
the
ditch
to
ride
by
when
one
hailed
him
hullo
my
man
said
he
are
you
a
friend
to
congress
i
m
off
to
charlestown
to
leave
the
lad
said
my
father
and
then
to
fight
the
good
said
the
other
and
then
where
are
you
from
upper
yadkin
answered
my
father
and
you
the
officer
who
was
a
young
man
looked
surprised
but
then
he
laughed
pleasantly
we
re
north
carolina
troops
going
to
join
lee
in
charlestown
said
he
the
british
are
sending
a
fleet
and
regiments
against
oh
aye
said
my
father
and
would
have
passed
on
but
he
was
made
to
go
before
the
colonel
who
plied
him
with
many
questions
then
he
gave
us
a
paper
and
dismissed
us
we
pursued
our
journey
through
the
heat
that
shimmered
up
from
the
road
pausing
now
and
again
in
the
shade
of
a
wayside
tree
at
times
i
thought
i
could
bear
the
sun
no
longer
but
towards
four
o
clock
of
that
day
a
great
bank
of
yellow
cloud
rolled
up
darkening
the
earth
save
for
a
queer
saffron
light
that
stained
everything
and
made
our
very
faces
yellow
and
then
a
wind
burst
out
of
the
east
with
a
high
mournful
note
as
from
a
great
flute
afar
filling
the
air
with
leaves
and
branches
of
trees
but
it
bore
too
a
savor
that
was
new
to
me
a
salt
savor
deep
and
fresh
that
i
drew
down
into
my
lungs
and
i
knew
that
we
were
near
the
ocean
then
came
the
rain
in
great
billows
as
though
the
ocean
itself
were
upon
us
the
next
day
we
crossed
a
ferry
on
the
ashley
river
and
rode
down
the
sand
of
charlestown
neck
and
my
most
vivid
remembrance
is
of
the
great
trunks
towering
half
a
hundred
feet
in
the
air
with
a
tassel
of
leaves
at
the
top
which
my
father
said
were
palmettos
something
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
for
i
had
grown
to
know
his
moods
by
a
sort
of
silent
understanding
and
when
the
roofs
and
spires
of
the
town
shone
over
the
foliage
in
the
afternoon
sun
i
felt
him
give
a
great
sigh
that
was
like
a
sob
and
how
shall
i
describe
the
splendor
of
that
city
the
sandy
streets
and
the
gardens
of
flower
and
shade
heavy
with
the
plant
odors
and
the
great
houses
with
their
galleries
and
porticos
set
in
the
midst
of
the
gardens
that
i
remember
staring
at
wistfully
but
before
long
we
came
to
a
barricade
fixed
across
the
street
and
then
to
another
and
presently
in
an
open
space
near
a
large
building
was
a
company
of
soldiers
at
drill
it
did
not
strike
me
as
strange
then
that
my
father
asked
his
way
of
no
man
but
went
to
a
little
ordinary
in
a
humbler
part
of
the
town
after
a
modest
meal
in
a
corner
of
the
public
room
we
went
out
for
a
stroll
then
from
the
wharves
i
saw
the
bay
dotted
with
islands
their
white
sand
sparkling
in
the
evening
light
and
fringed
with
strange
trees
and
beyond
of
a
deepening
blue
the
ocean
and
nearer
greatest
of
all
delights
to
me
riding
on
the
swell
was
a
fleet
of
ships
my
father
gazed
at
them
long
and
silently
his
palm
over
his
eyes
from
the
old
country
lad
he
said
after
a
while
they
re
a
brave
and
why
are
they
here
i
asked
they
ve
come
to
fight
said
he
and
take
the
town
again
for
the
it
was
twilight
when
we
turned
to
go
and
then
i
saw
that
many
of
the
warehouses
along
the
wharves
were
heaps
of
ruins
my
father
said
this
was
that
the
town
might
be
the
better
defended
we
bent
our
way
towards
one
of
the
sandy
streets
where
the
great
houses
were
and
to
my
surprise
we
turned
in
at
a
gate
and
up
a
path
leading
to
the
high
steps
of
one
of
these
under
the
high
portico
the
door
was
open
but
the
house
within
was
dark
my
father
paused
and
the
hand
he
held
to
mine
trembled
then
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
and
raising
the
big
polished
knocker
that
hung
on
the
panel
let
it
drop
the
sound
reverberated
through
the
house
and
then
stillness
and
then
from
within
a
shuffling
sound
and
an
old
negro
came
to
the
door
for
an
instant
he
stood
staring
through
the
dusk
and
broke
into
a
cry
marse
alec
he
said
is
your
master
at
home
said
my
father
without
another
word
he
led
us
through
a
deep
hall
and
out
into
a
gallery
above
the
trees
of
a
back
garden
where
a
gentleman
sat
smoking
a
long
pipe
the
old
negro
stopped
in
front
of
him
marse
john
said
he
his
voice
shaking
heah
s
marse
alec
done
come
the
gentleman
got
to
his
feet
with
a
start
his
pipe
fell
to
the
floor
and
the
ashes
scattered
on
the
boards
and
lay
glowing
there
alec
he
cried
peering
into
my
father
s
face
alec
you
re
not
john
said
my
father
can
we
talk
here
good
god
said
the
gentleman
you
re
just
the
same
to
think
of
it
to
think
of
it
breed
a
light
in
the
there
was
no
word
spoken
while
the
negro
was
gone
and
the
time
seemed
very
long
but
at
length
he
returned
a
silver
candlestick
in
each
hand
careful
cried
the
gentleman
petulantly
you
ll
drop
he
led
the
way
into
the
house
and
through
the
hall
to
a
massive
door
of
mahogany
with
a
silver
the
grandeur
of
the
place
awed
me
and
well
it
might
boylike
i
was
absorbed
in
this
our
little
mountain
cabin
would
almost
have
gone
into
this
one
room
the
candles
threw
their
flickering
rays
upward
until
they
danced
on
the
high
ceiling
marvel
of
marvels
in
the
oval
left
clear
by
the
heavy
rounded
cornice
was
a
picture
the
negro
set
down
the
candles
on
the
marble
top
of
a
table
but
the
air
of
the
room
was
heavy
and
close
and
the
gentleman
went
to
a
window
and
flung
it
open
it
came
down
instantly
with
a
crash
so
that
the
panes
rattled
again
curse
these
rebels
he
shouted
they
ve
taken
our
window
weights
to
make
calling
to
the
negro
to
pry
open
the
window
with
a
he
threw
himself
into
a
big
upholstered
chair
twas
then
i
remarked
the
splendor
of
his
clothes
which
were
silk
and
he
wore
a
waistcoat
all
sewed
with
flowers
with
a
boy
s
intuition
i
began
to
dislike
him
intensely
damn
the
rebels
he
began
they
ve
driven
his
lordship
away
i
hope
his
majesty
will
hang
every
mother
s
son
of
em
all
pleasure
of
life
is
gone
and
they
ve
folly
enough
to
think
they
can
resist
the
fleet
and
the
worst
of
it
is
cried
he
the
worst
of
it
is
i
m
forced
to
smirk
to
them
and
give
good
gold
to
their
seeing
that
my
father
did
not
answer
he
asked
have
you
joined
the
highlanders
you
were
always
for
i
m
to
be
at
cherokee
ford
on
the
twentieth
said
my
father
we
re
to
scalp
the
redskins
and
cameron
though
tis
not
cameron
shrieked
the
gentleman
but
that
s
the
other
side
man
against
his
majesty
one
side
or
t
other
said
my
father
tis
all
one
against
alec
the
gentleman
looked
at
my
father
with
something
like
terror
in
his
eyes
you
ll
never
forgive
cameron
he
said
i
ll
no
forgive
anybody
who
does
me
a
wrong
said
my
father
and
where
have
you
been
all
these
years
alec
he
asked
presently
since
you
went
off
with
i
ve
been
in
the
mountains
leading
a
pure
life
said
my
father
and
we
ll
speak
of
nothing
if
you
please
that
s
gone
and
what
will
you
have
me
do
said
the
gentleman
helplessly
little
enough
said
my
father
keep
the
lad
till
i
come
again
he
s
quiet
he
ll
no
trouble
you
greatly
davy
this
is
temple

with
him
till

said
the
gentleman
and
he
peered
into
my
face
you
ll
not
resemble
your
he
ll
resemble
no
one
said
my
father
shortly
davy
keep
this
till
i
come
and
he
gave
me
the
parcel
made
of
my
mother
s
gown
then
he
lifted
me
in
his
strong
arms
and
kissed
me
and
strode
out
of
the
house
we
listened
in
silence
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
until
his
footsteps
died
away
on
the
path
then
the
gentleman
rose
and
pulled
a
cord
hastily
the
negro
came
in
put
the
lad
to
bed
breed
said
he
whah
suh
oh

said
the
master
he
turned
to
me
i
ll
be
better
able
to
talk
to
you
in
the
morning
david
said
he
i
followed
the
old
servant
up
the
great
stairs
gulping
down
a
sob
that
would
rise
and
clutching
my
mother
s
gown
tight
under
my
arm
had
my
father
left
me
alone
in
our
cabin
for
a
fortnight
i
should
not
have
minded
but
here
in
this
strange
house
amid
such
strange
surroundings
i
was
heartbroken
the
old
negro
was
very
kind
he
led
me
into
a
little
bedroom
and
placing
the
candle
on
a
polished
dresser
he
regarded
me
with
sympathy

often
since

have
wished
that
i
had
questioned
breed
of
many
things
on
which
i
had
no
curiosity
then
for
he
was
my
chief
companion
in
the
weeks
that
followed
he

and
early

i

that
breed
gave
a
wink
and
led
me
out
of
the
window
onto
a
gallery
above
the
one
where
we
had
found
the
master
the
night
before
he
pointed
across
the
dense
foliage
of
the
garden
to
a
strip
of
water
gleaming
in
the
morning
sun
beyond

the

was
going
out
of

breed
hailed
me
marse

i
indignantly
i
knowed
you
wahn
t
said
breed
you
don
look
as
if
you
d
tell
we
found
the
master
pacing
the
lower
gallery
at
first
he
barely
glanced
at
me
and
nodded
after
a
while
he
stopped
and
began
to
put
to
me
many
questions
about
my
life
when
and
how
i
had
lived
and
to
some
of
my
answers
he
exclaimed
good
god
that
was
all
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
hands
like
a
woman
s
well
set
off
by
the
lace
at
his
sleeves
he
had
features
and
the
white
linen
he
wore
was
most
becoming
david
said
he
at
length
and
i
noted
that
he
lowered
his
voice
david
you
seem
a
discreet
lad
pay
attention
to
what
i
tell
you
and
mark
if
you
disobey
me
you
will
be
well
whipped
you
have
this
house
and
garden
to
play
in
but
you
are
by
no
means
to
go
out
at
the
front
of
the
house
and
whatever
you
may
see
or
hear
you
are
to
tell
no
one
do
you
understand
yes
sir
i
said
for
the
rest
said
he
breed
will
give
you
food
and
look
out
for
your
and
so
he
dismissed
me
they
were
lonely
days
after
that
for
a
boy
used
to
activity
and
only
the
damp
garden
paths
and
lawns
to
run
on
the
creek
at
the
back
of
the
garden
was
stagnant
and
marshy
when
the
water
fell
and
overhung
by
leafy
boughs
on
each
side
of
the
garden
was
a
high
brick
wall
and
though
i
was
often
tempted
to
climb
it
i
felt
that
disobedience
was
disloyalty
to
my
father
then
there
was
the
great
house
dark
and
lonely
in
its
magnificence
over
which
i
roamed
until
i
knew
every
corner
of
it
i
was
most
interested
of
all
in
the
pictures
of
men
and
women
in
quaint
costumes
and
i
used
during
the
great
heat
of
the
day
to
sit
in
the
and
study
these
and
wonder
who
they
were
and
when
they
lived
another
amusement
i
had
was
to
climb
into
the
deep
windows
and
peer
through
the
blinds
across
the
front
garden
into
the
street
sometimes
men
stopped
and
talked
loudly
there
and
again
a
rattle
of
drums
would
send
me
running
to
see
the
soldiers
i
recall
that
i
had
a
poor
enough
notion
of
what
the
fighting
was
all
about
and
no
wonder
but
i
remember
chiefly
my
insatiable
longing
to
escape
from
this
prison
as
the
great
house
soon
became
for
me
and
i
yearned
with
a
yearning
i
can
not
express
for
our
cabin
in
the
hills
and
the
old
life
there
i
caught
glimpses
of
the
master
on
occasions
only
and
then
i
avoided
him
for
i
knew
he
had
no
wish
to
see
me
sometimes
he
would
be
seated
in
the
gallery
tapping
his
foot
on
the
floor
and
sometimes
pacing
the
garden
walks
with
his
hands
opening
and
shutting
and
one
night
i
awoke
with
a
start
and
lay
for
a
while
listening
until
i
heard
something
like
a
splash
and
the
scraping
of
the
of
a
boat
irresistibly
i
jumped
out
of
bed
and
running
to
the
gallery
rail
i
saw
two
dark
figures
moving
among
the
leaves
below
the
next
morning
i
came
suddenly
on
a
strange
gentleman
in
the
gallery
he
wore
a
flowered
like
the
one
i
had
seen
on
the
master
and
he
had
a
jolly
round
face
i
stopped
and
stared
who
the
devil
are
you
said
he
but
not
unkindly
my
name
is
david
trimble
said
i
and
i
come
from
the
he
laughed
mr
david
who
the
devil
am
i
i
don
t
know
sir
and
i
started
to
go
away
not
wishing
to
disturb
him
avast
he
cried
stand
fast
see
that
you
remember
i
m
not
here
of
my
free
will
sir
but
because
my
father
wishes
it
and
i
ll
betray

he
stared
at
me
how
old
did
you
say
you
were
he
demanded
i
didn
t
say
said
i
and
you
are
of
scotch
descent
said
he
i
didn
t
say
so
you
re
a
rum
one
said
he
laughing
again
and
he
disappeared
into
the
house
that
day
when
breed
brought
me
my
dinner
on
my
gallery
he
did
not
speak
of
a
visitor
you
may
be
sure
i
did
not
mention
the
circumstance
but
breed
always
told

eyes

said
breed
the
negro
dropped
his
work
and
led
the
way
upstairs
i
following
expectant
to
the
attic
a
rickety
ladder
rose
to
a
kind
of
tower
cupola
i
suppose
it
would
be
called
whence
the
bay
spread
out
before
me
like
a
picture
the
white
islands
edged
with
the
whiter
lacing
of
the
waves
there
indeed
was
the
fleet
but
far
away
like
toy
ships
on
the
water
and
the
bit
of
a
fort
perched
on
the
sandy
edge
of
an
island
i
spent
most
of
that
day
there
watching
anxiously
for
some
movement
but
none
came
that
night
i
was
again
awakened
and
running
into
the
gallery
i
heard
quick
footsteps
in
the
garden
then
there
was
a
lantern
s
flash
a
smothered
oath
and
all
was
dark
again
but
in
the
flash
i
had
seen
distinctly
three
figures
one
was
breed
and
he
held
the
lantern
another
was
the
master
and
the
third
a
stout
one
muffled
in
a
cloak
i
made
no
doubt
was
my
jolly
friend
i
lay
long
awake
with
a
boy
s
curiosity
until
presently
the
dawn
broke
and
i
arose
and
dressed
and
began
to
wander
about
the
house
no
breed
was
sweeping
the
gallery
nor
was
there
any
sign
of
the
master
the
house
was
as
still
as
a
tomb
and
the
echoes
of
my
footsteps
rolled
through
the
halls
and
chambers
at
last
prompted
by
curiosity
and
fear
i
sought
the
kitchen
where
i
had
often
sat
with
breed
as
he
cooked
the
master
s
dinner
this
was
at
the
bottom
and
end
of
the
house
the
great
fire
there
was
cold
and
the
pots
and
pans
hung
neatly
on
their
hooks
untouched
that
day
i
was
running
through
the
wet
garden
glad
to
be
out
in
the
light
when
a
sound
stopped
me
it
was
a
dull
roar
from
the
direction
of
the
bay
almost
instantly
came
another
and
another
and
then
several
broke
together
and
i
knew
that
the
battle
had
begun
forgetting
for
the
moment
my
loneliness
i
ran
into
the
house
and
up
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
and
up
the
ladder
into
the
cupola
where
i
flung
open
the
casement
and
leaned
out
there
was
the
battle
indeed
a
sight
so
vivid
to
me
after
all
these
years
that
i
can
call
it
again
before
me
when
i
will
the
toy
with
sails
set
ranging
in
front
of
the
fort
they
looked
at
my
distance
to
be
pressed
against
it
white
puffs
like
cotton
balls
would
dart
one
after
another
from
a
ship
s
side
melt
into
a
cloud
float
over
her
spars
and
hide
her
from
my
view
and
then
presently
the
roar
would
reach
me
and
answering
puffs
along
the
line
of
the
fort
and
i
could
see
the
mortar
shells
go
up
and
up
leaving
a
scorched
trail
behind
curve
in
a
great
circle
and
fall
upon
the
little
garrison
mister
moultrie
became
a
real
person
to
me
then
a
vivid
picture
in
my
boyish
mind
a
hero
beyond
all
other
heroes
as
the
sun
got
up
in
the
heavens
and
the
wind
fell
the
cupola
became
a
but
i
scarcely
felt
the
heat
my
whole
soul
was
out
in
the
bay
pent
up
with
the
men
in
the
fort
how
long
could
they
hold
out
why
were
they
not
all
killed
by
the
shot
that
fell
like
hail
among
them
yet
puff
after
puff
sprang
from
their
guns
and
the
sound
of
it
was
like
a
storm
coming
nearer
in
the
heat
but
at
noon
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
some
of
the
ships
were
sailing
it
was
true
slowly
they
drew
away
from
the
others
and
presently
i
thought
they
had
stopped
again
surely
two
of
them
were
stuck
together
then
three
were
fast
on
a
shoal
boats
like
black
bugs
in
the
water
came
and
went
between
them
and
the
others
after
a
long
time
the
two
that
were
together
got
apart
and
away
but
the
third
stayed
there
immovable
helpless
throughout
the
afternoon
the
fight
kept
on
the
little
black
boats
coming
and
going
i
saw
a
mast
totter
and
fall
on
one
of
the
ships
i
saw
the
flag
shot
away
from
the
fort
and
reappear
again
but
now
the
puffs
came
from
her
walls
slowly
and
more
slowly
so
that
my
heart
sank
with
the
setting
sun
and
presently
it
grew
too
dark
to
see
aught
save
the
red
flashes
slowly
reluctantly
the
noise
died
down
until
at
last
a
great
silence
reigned
broken
only
now
and
again
by
voices
in
the
streets
below
me
it
was
not
until
then
that
i
realized
that
i
had
been
all
day
without
food
that
i
was
alone
in
the
dark
of
a
great
house
i
had
never
known
fear
in
the
woods
at
night
but
now
i
trembled
as
i
felt
my
way
down
the
ladder
and
groped
and
stumbled
through
the
black
attic
for
the
stairs
every
noise
i
made
seemed
louder
an
hundred
fold
than
the
battle
had
been
and
when
i
barked
my
shins
the
pain
was
sharper
than
a
knife
below
on
the
big
stairway
the
echo
of
my
footsteps
sounded
again
from
the
empty
rooms
so
that
i
was
taken
with
a
panic
and
fled
downward
sliding
and
falling
until
i
reached
the
hall
frantically
as
i
tried
i
could
not
unfasten
the
bolts
on
the
front
door
and
so
running
into
the
i
pried
open
the
window
and
sat
me
down
in
the
embrasure
to
think
and
to
try
to
quiet
the
thumpings
of
my
heart
by
degrees
i
succeeded
the
still
air
of
the
night
and
the
heavy
damp
odors
of
the
foliage
helped
me
and
i
tried
to
think
what
was
right
for
me
to
do
i
had
promised
the
master
not
to
leave
the
place
and
that
promise
seemed
in
pledge
to
my
father
surely
the
master
would
come
back
or
breed
they
would
not
leave
me
here
alone
without
food
much
longer
although
i
was
young
i
was
brought
up
to
responsibility
and
i
inherited
a
conscience
that
has
since
given
me
much
trouble
from
these
thoughts
trying
enough
for
a
starved
lad
i
fell
to
thinking
of
my
father
on
the
frontier
fighting
the
cherokees
and
so
i
dozed
away
to
dream
of
him
i
remember
that
he
was
skinning
cameron
i
had
often
pictured
it
and
cameron
yelling
when
i
was
awakened
with
a
shock
by
a
great
noise
i
listened
with
my
heart
in
my
throat
the
noise
seemed
to
come
from
the
hall
a
prodigious
pounding
presently
it
stopped
and
a
man
s
voice
cried
out
ho
there
within
my
first
impulse
was
to
answer
but
fear
kept
me
still
batter
down
the
door
some
one
shouted
there
was
a
sound
of
shuffling
in
the
portico
and
the
same
voice
now
then
all
together
lads
then
came
a
straining
and
splitting
of
wood
and
with
a
crash
the
door
gave
way
a
lantern
s
rays
shot
through
the
hall
the
house
is
as
dark
as
a
tomb
said
a
voice
and
as
empty
i
reckon
said
another
john
temple
and
his
spy
have
got
we
ll
have
a
search
answered
the
first
voice
they
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
door
peering
and
then
they
entered
there
were
five
of
them
two
looked
to
be
gentlemen
and
three
were
of
rougher
appearance
they
carried
lanterns
that
window
s
open
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
they
must
have
been
here
hello
what
s
this
he
started
back
in
surprise
i
slid
down
from
the
and
stood
facing
them
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
they
too
seemed
equally
confounded
it
must
be
temple
s
son
said
one
at
last
i
had
thought
the
family
at
temple
bow
what
s
your
name
my
lad
david
trimble
sir
said
i
and
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
more
sternly
i
was
left
in
temple
s
care
by
my
oho
he
cried
and
where
is
your
father
he
s
gone
to
fight
the
cherokees
i
answered
soberly
to
skin
a
man
named
at
that
they
were
silent
for
an
instant
and
then
the
two
broke
into
a
laugh
egad
lowndes
said
the
gentleman
here
is
a
fine
mystery
do
you
think
the
boy
is
lying
the
other
gentleman
scratched
his
forehead
i
ll
have
you
know
i
don
t
lie
sir
i
said
ready
to
cry
no
said
the
other
gentleman
a
backwoodsman
named
trimble
went
to
rutledge
with
credentials
from
north
carolina
and
has
gone
off
to
cherokee
ford
to
join
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
first
gentleman
he
came
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
said
where
is
temple
that
i
don
t
know
when
did
he
go
away
i
did
not
answer
at
once
that
i
can
t
tell
you
was
there
any
one
with
him
that
i
can
t
tell
you
the
devil
you
can
t
he
cried
taking
his
hand
away
and
why
not
i
shook
my
head
sorely
beset
come
mathews
cried
the
gentleman
called
lowndes
we
ll
search
first
and
attend
to
the
lad
and
so
they
began
going
through
the
house
prying
into
every
cupboard
and
sweeping
under
every
bed
they
even
climbed
to
the
attic
and
noting
the
open
casement
in
the
cupola
lowndes
said
some
one
has
been
here
it
was
i
sir
i
said
i
have
been
here
all
and
what
doing
pray
he
demanded
watching
the
battle
and
oh
sir
i
cried
can
you
tell
me
whether
mister
moultrie
beat
the
british
he
did
so
cried
lowndes
he
did
and
he
stared
at
me
i
must
have
looked
my
pleasure
why
david
says
he
you
are
a
patriot
i
am
a
rebel
sir
i
cried
hotly
both
gentlemen
laughed
again
and
the
men
with
them
the
lad
is
a
character
said
lowndes
we
made
our
way
down
into
the
garden
which
they
searched
last
at
the
creek
s
side
the
boat
was
gone
and
there
were
footsteps
in
the
mud
the
bird
has
flown
lowndes
said
mathews
and
good
riddance
for
the
committee
answered
that
gentleman
heartily
he
got
to
the
fleet
in
fine
season
to
get
a
round
shot
in
the
middle
david
said
he
solemnly
remember
it
never
pays
to
try
to
be
two
things
at
i
ll
warrant
he
stayed
below
water
said
mathews
but
what
shall
we
do
with
the
lad
i
ll
take
him
to
my
house
for
the
night
said
lowndes
and
in
the
morning
we
ll
talk
to
him
i
reckon
he
should
be
sent
to
temple
bow
he
is
connected
in
some
way
with
the
god
help
him
if
he
goes
there
said
mathews
under
his
breath
but
i
heard
him
they
locked
up
the
house
and
left
one
of
the
men
to
guard
it
while
i
went
with
lowndes
to
his
residence
i
remember
that
people
were
gathered
in
the
streets
as
we
passed
making
merry
and
that
they
greeted
lowndes
with
respect
and
good
cheer
his
house
too
was
set
in
a
garden
and
quite
as
fine
as
temple
s
it
was
ablaze
with
candles
and
i
caught
glimpses
of
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
the
rooms
but
he
hurried
me
through
the
hall
and
into
a
little
chamber
at
the
rear
where
a
was
set
he
turned
and
faced
me
you
must
be
tired
david
he
said
i
nodded
and
hungry
boys
are
always
yes
you
had
no
dinner
no
sir
i
answered
off
my
guard
mercy
he
said
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
had
no
breakfast
good
god
he
said
and
pulled
the
velvet
handle
of
a
cord
a
negro
came
is
the
supper
for
the
guests
ready
yes
then
bring
as
much
as
you
can
carry
here
said
the
gentleman
and
ask
lowndes
if
i
may
speak
with
lowndes
came
first
and
such
a
fine
lady
she
was
that
she
frightened
me
this
being
my
first
experience
with
ladies
but
when
lowndes
told
her
my
story
she
ran
to
me
impulsively
and
put
her
arms
about
me
poor
lad
she
said
what
a
shame
i
think
that
the
tears
came
then
but
it
was
small
wonder
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
too
such
a
supper
as
i
had
i
shall
never
forget
and
she
sat
beside
me
for
long
neglecting
her
guests
and
talking
of
my
life
suddenly
she
turned
to
her
husband
calling
him
by
name
he
is
alec
ritchie
s
son
she
said
and
alec
has
gone
against
lowndes
did
not
answer
but
nodded
and
must
he
go
to
temple
bow
my
dear
said
lowndes
i
fear
it
is
our
duty
to
send
him
chapter
iv
temple
bow
in
the
morning
i
started
for
temple
bow
on
horseback
behind
one
of
lowndes
negroes
good
lowndes
had
kissed
me
at
parting
and
tucked
into
my
pocket
a
parcel
of
sweetmeats
there
had
been
a
few
grave
gentlemen
to
see
me
and
to
their
questions
i
had
replied
what
i
could
but
tell
them
of
temple
i
would
not
save
that
he
himself
had
told
me
nothing
and
lowndes
had
presently
put
an
end
to
their
talk
the
lad
knows
nothing
gentlemen
he
had
said
which
was
true
david
said
he
when
he
bade
me
farewell
i
see
that
your
father
has
brought
you
up
to
fear
god
remember
that
all
you
see
in
this
life
is
not
to
be
and
so
i
went
off
behind
his
negro
he
was
a
merry
lad
and
despite
the
great
heat
of
the
journey
and
my
misgivings
about
temple
bow
he
made
me
laugh
i
was
sad
at
crossing
the
ferry
over
the
ashley
through
thinking
of
my
father
but
i
reflected
that
it
could
not
be
long
now
ere
i
saw
him
again
in
the
middle
of
the
day
we
stopped
at
a
tavern
and
at
length
in
the
abundant
shade
of
evening
we
came
to
a
pair
of
great
ornamental
gates
set
between
brick
pillars
capped
with
white
balls
and
turned
into
a
drive
and
presently
winding
through
the
trees
we
were
in
sight
of
a
long
brick
mansion
trimmed
with
white
and
a
velvet
lawn
before
it
all
flecked
with
shadows
in
front
of
the
portico
was
a
saddled
horse
craning
his
long
neck
at
two
panting
hounds
stretched
on
the
ground
a
negro
boy
in
blue
clutched
the
bridle
on
the
a
gentleman
in
white
reclined
he
wore
shiny
boots
and
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
he
was
gazing
up
at
a
lady
who
stood
on
the
steps
above
him
the
lady
i
remember
as
well
lord
forbid
that
i
should
forget
her
and
her
laugh
as
i
heard
it
that
evening
is
ringing
now
in
my
ears
and
yet
it
was
not
a
laugh
musical
it
was
yet
there
seemed
no
pleasure
in
it
rather
irony
and
a
great
weariness
of
the
amusements
of
this
world
and
a
note
too
from
a
vanity
never
ruffled
it
stopped
abruptly
as
the
negro
pulled
up
his
horse
before
her
and
she
stared
at
us
haughtily
what
s
this
she
said
pardon
mistis
said
the
negro
i
se
got
a
letter
from
marse
mr
lowndes
should
instruct
his
niggers
she
said
there
is
a
servants
the
man
was
turning
his
horse
when
she
cried
hold
let
s
have
he
dismounted
and
gave
her
the
letter
and
i
jumped
to
the
ground
watching
her
as
she
broke
the
seal
taking
her
in
as
a
boy
will
from
the
flowing
skirt
and
stays
of
her
salmon
silk
to
her
high
and
powdered
hair
she
must
have
been
about
thirty
her
face
was
beautiful
but
had
no
particle
of
expression
in
it
and
was
dotted
here
and
there
with
little
black
patches
of
plaster
while
she
was
reading
a
sober
gentleman
in
black
silk
breeches
and
severe
coat
came
out
of
the
house
and
stood
beside
her
heigho
parson
said
the
gentleman
on
the
without
moving
are
you
to
preach
against
loo
or
lansquenet
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
riddle
before
he
could
answer
there
came
a
great
clatter
behind
them
and
a
boy
of
my
own
age
appeared
with
a
leap
he
landed
sprawling
on
the
indolent
gentleman
s
shoulders
nearly
upsetting
him
you
young
rascal
exclaimed
the
gentleman
pitching
him
on
the
drive
almost
at
my
feet
then
he
fell
back
again
to
a
position
where
he
could
look
up
at
the
lady
harry
riddle
cried
the
boy
i
ll
ride
steeplechases
and
beat
you
some
hush
nick
cried
the
lady
petulantly
i
ll
have
no
nerves
left
she
turned
to
the
letter
again
holding
it
very
near
to
her
eyes
and
made
a
wry
face
of
impatience
then
she
held
the
sheet
out
to
riddle
a
pretty
piece
of
news
she
said
languidly
read
it
the
gentleman
seized
her
hand
instead
the
lady
glanced
at
the
clergyman
whose
back
was
turned
and
shook
her
head
how
tiresome
you
are
she
said
what
s
happened
asked
riddle
letting
go
as
the
parson
looked
around
oh
they
ve
had
a
battle
said
the
lady
and
moultrie
and
his
rebels
have
beat
off
the
king
s
the
devil
they
have
exclaimed
riddle
while
the
parson
started
forwards
anything
more
yes
a
she
hesitated
that
husband
of
mine
has
fled
charlestown
they
think
he
went
to
the
and
she
shot
a
meaning
look
at
riddle
who
in
turn
flushed
red
i
was
watching
them
what
cried
the
clergyman
john
temple
has
run
away
why
not
said
riddle
one
can
t
live
between
wind
and
water
long
and
charlestown
s
uncomfortable
in
at
that
the
clergyman
cast
one
look
at
them
such
a
look
as
i
shall
never
forget
and
went
into
the
house
mamma
said
the
boy
where
has
father
gone
has
he
run
away
yes
don
t
bother
me
i
don
t
believe
it
cried
nick
his
high
voice
shaking
i
d
i
d
disown
at
that
riddle
burst
into
a
hearty
laugh
come
nick
said
he
it
isn
t
so
bad
as
that
your
father
s
for
his
majesty
like
the
rest
of
us
he
s
merely
gone
over
to
fight
for
and
he
looked
at
the
lady
and
laughed
again
but
i
liked
the
boy
as
for
the
lady
she
curled
her
lip
mr
riddle
don
t
be
foolish
she
said
if
we
are
to
play
send
your
horse
to
the
suddenly
her
eye
lighted
on
me
one
more
brat
she
sighed
nick
take
him
to
the
nursery
or
the
stable
and
both
of
you
keep
out
of
my
nick
strode
up
to
me
don
t
mind
her
she
s
always
saying
keep
out
of
my
his
voice
trembled
he
took
me
by
the
sleeve
and
began
pulling
me
around
the
house
and
into
a
little
summer
bower
that
stood
there
for
he
had
a
masterful
manner
what
s
your
name
he
demanded
david
trimble
i
said
have
you
seen
my
father
in
town
the
intense
earnestness
of
the
question
surprised
an
answer
out
of
me
where
he
demanded
in
his
house
my
father
left
me
with
your
tell
me
about
i
related
as
much
as
i
dared
leaving
out
temple
s
double
dealing
which
in
truth
i
did
not
understand
but
the
boy
was
relentless
why
said
he
my
father
was
a
friend
of
lowndes
and
mathews
i
have
seen
them
here
drinking
with
him
and
in
town
and
he
ran
away
i
do
not
know
where
he
went
said
i
which
was
the
truth
he
said
nothing
but
hid
his
face
in
his
arms
over
the
rail
of
the
bower
at
length
he
looked
up
at
me
fiercely
if
you
ever
tell
this
i
will
kill
you
he
cried
do
you
hear
that
made
me
angry
yes
i
hear
i
said
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
he
was
at
me
in
an
instant
knocking
me
to
the
floor
so
that
the
breath
went
out
of
me
and
was
pounding
me
vigorously
ere
i
recovered
from
the
shock
and
astonishment
of
it
and
began
to
defend
myself
he
was
taller
than
i
and
wiry
but
not
so
rugged
yet
there
was
a
look
about
him
that
was
far
beyond
his
strength
a
look
that
meant
never
say
die
curiously
even
as
i
fought
desperately
i
compared
him
with
that
other
lad
i
had
known
andy
jackson
and
this
one
though
not
so
powerful
frightened
me
the
more
in
his
relentlessness
perhaps
we
should
have
been
fighting
still
had
not
some
one
pulled
us
apart
and
when
my
vision
cleared
i
saw
nick
struggling
and
kicking
held
tightly
in
the
hands
of
the
clergyman
and
it
was
all
that
gentleman
could
do
to
hold
him
i
am
sure
it
was
quite
five
minutes
before
he
forced
the
lad
exhausted
on
to
the
seat
and
then
there
was
a
defiance
about
his
nostrils
that
showed
he
was
undefeated
the
clergyman
still
holding
him
with
one
hand
took
out
his
handkerchief
with
the
other
and
wiped
his
brow
i
expected
a
scolding
and
a
sermon
to
my
amazement
the
clergyman
said
quietly
now
what
was
the
trouble
david
i
ll
not
be
the
one
to
tell
it
sir
i
said
and
trembled
at
my
temerity
the
parson
looked
at
me
queerly
then
you
are
in
the
right
of
it
he
said
it
is
as
i
thought
i
ll
not
expect
nicholas
to
tell
i
will
tell
you
sir
said
nicholas
he
was
in
the
house
with
my
father
when
when
he
ran
away
and
i
said
that
if
he
ever
spoke
of
it
to
any
one
i
would
kill
for
a
while
the
clergyman
was
silent
gazing
with
a
strange
tenderness
at
the
lad
whose
face
was
averted
and
you
david
he
said
presently
i
i
never
mean
to
tell
sir
but
i
was
not
to
be
quite
right
my
lad
said
the
clergyman
so
kindly
that
it
sent
a
strange
thrill
through
me
nicholas
looked
up
quickly
you
won
t
tell
he
said
no
i
said
you
can
let
me
go
now
mason
said
he
mason
did
and
he
came
over
and
sat
beside
me
but
said
nothing
more
after
a
while
mason
cleared
his
throat
nicholas
said
he
when
you
grow
older
you
will
understand
these
matters
better
your
father
went
away
to
join
the
side
he
believes
in
the
side
we
all
believe
in
the
king
s
did
he
ever
pretend
to
like
the
other
side
asked
nick
quickly
when
you
grow
older
you
will
know
his
motives
answered
the
clergyman
gently
until
then
you
must
trust
you
never
pretended
cried
nick
thank
god
i
never
was
forced
to
do
so
said
the
clergyman
fervently
it
is
wonderful
that
the
conditions
of
our
existence
may
wholly
change
without
a
seeming
strangeness
after
many
years
only
vivid
snatches
of
what
i
saw
and
heard
and
did
at
temple
bow
come
back
to
me
i
understood
but
little
the
meaning
of
the
seigniorial
life
there
my
chief
wonder
now
is
that
its
golden
surface
was
not
more
troubled
by
the
winds
then
brewing
it
was
a
new
life
to
me
one
that
i
had
not
dreamed
of
after
that
first
falling
out
nick
and
i
became
inseparable
far
slower
than
he
in
my
likes
and
dislikes
he
soon
became
a
passion
with
me
even
as
a
boy
he
did
everything
with
a
grace
unsurpassed
the
dash
and
daring
of
his
pranks
took
one
s
breath
his
generosity
to
those
he
loved
was
prodigal
nor
did
he
ever
miss
a
chance
to
score
those
under
his
displeasure
at
times
he
was
reckless
beyond
words
to
describe
and
again
he
would
fall
sober
for
a
day
he
could
be
cruel
and
tender
in
the
same
hour
abandoned
and
freezing
in
his
dignity
he
had
an
old
negro
mammy
whose
worship
for
him
and
his
possessions
was
idolatry
i
can
hear
her
now
calling
and
calling
marse
nick
honey
yo
supper
s
done
got
cole
as
she
searched
patiently
among
the
magnolias
and
suddenly
there
would
be
a
shout
and
mammy
s
turban
go
flying
from
her
woolly
head
or
mammy
herself
would
be
dragged
down
from
behind
and
sat
upon
we
had
our
supper
nick
and
i
at
twilight
in
the
children
s
dining
room
a
little
white
room
unevenly
panelled
the
silver
candlesticks
and
yellow
flames
fantastically
reflected
in
the
mirrors
between
the
deep
windows
and
the
moths
and
tilting
at
the
lights
we
sat
at
a
little
mahogany
table
eating
porridge
and
cream
from
round
blue
bowls
with
mammy
to
wait
on
us
sometimes
there
floated
in
upon
us
the
hum
of
revelry
from
the
great
where
madame
had
her
company
often
the
good
mason
would
come
in
to
us
he
cared
little
for
the
parties
and
talk
to
us
of
our
day
s
doings
nick
had
his
lessons
from
the
clergyman
in
the
winter
time
mason
took
occasion
once
to
question
me
on
what
i
knew
some
of
my
answers
in
especial
those
relating
to
my
knowledge
of
the
bible
surprised
him
others
made
him
sad
david
said
he
you
are
an
earnest
lad
with
a
head
to
learn
and
you
will
when
your
father
comes
i
shall
talk
with
he
paused
i
knew
him
said
he
i
knew
him
ere
you
were
born
a
just
man
and
upright
but
with
a
great
sorrow
we
must
never
be
hasty
in
our
judgments
but
you
will
never
be
hasty
david
he
added
smiling
at
me
you
are
a
good
companion
for
nicholas
and
i
slept
in
the
same
bedroom
at
a
corner
of
the
long
house
and
far
removed
from
his
mother
she
would
not
be
disturbed
by
the
noise
he
made
in
the
mornings
i
remember
that
he
had
cut
in
the
solid
shutters
of
that
room
folded
into
the
embrasures
nicholas
temple
his
mark
and
a
long
flat
sword
the
first
night
in
that
room
we
slept
but
little
near
the
whole
of
it
being
occupied
with
tales
of
my
adventures
and
of
my
life
in
the
mountains
over
and
over
again
i
must
tell
him
of
the
painters
and
wildcats
of
deer
and
bear
and
wolf
nor
was
he
ever
satisfied
and
at
length
i
came
to
speak
of
that
land
where
i
had
often
lived
in
fancy
the
land
beyond
the
mountains
of
which
daniel
boone
had
told
of
its
forest
and
glade
its
countless
herds
of
elk
and
buffalo
its
and
indians
until
we
fell
asleep
from
sheer
exhaustion
i
will
go
there
he
cried
in
the
morning
as
he
hurried
into
his
clothes
i
will
go
to
that
land
as
sure
as
my
name
is
nick
temple
and
you
shall
go
with
me
perchance
i
shall
go
before
you
i
answered
though
i
had
small
hopes
of
persuading
my
father
he
would
often
make
his
exit
by
the
window
climbing
down
into
the
garden
by
the
protruding
bricks
at
the
corner
of
the
house
or
sometimes
go
shouting
down
the
long
halls
and
through
the
gallery
to
the
great
stairway
a
smothered
oath
from
behind
the
closed
bedroom
doors
proclaiming
that
he
had
waked
a
guest
and
many
days
we
spent
in
the
wood
playing
at
hunting
game
a
poor
enough
amusement
for
me
and
one
that
nick
soon
tired
of
they
were
thick
wet
woods
unlike
our
woods
of
the
mountains
and
more
than
once
we
had
excitement
enough
with
the
snakes
that
lay
there
i
believe
that
in
a
week
s
time
nick
was
as
conversant
with
my
life
as
i
myself
for
he
made
me
tell
of
it
again
and
again
and
of
kentucky
and
always
as
he
listened
his
eyes
would
glow
and
his
breast
heave
with
excitement
do
you
think
your
father
will
take
you
there
david
when
he
comes
for
you
i
hoped
so
but
was
doubtful
i
ll
run
away
with
you
he
declared
there
is
no
one
here
who
cares
for
me
save
mason
and
and
i
believe
he
meant
it
he
saw
but
little
of
his
mother
and
nearly
always
something
unpleasant
was
coupled
with
his
views
sometimes
we
ran
across
her
in
the
garden
paths
walking
with
a
gallant
oftenest
riddle
it
was
a
beautiful
garden
with
walks
and
flowers
wondrously
massed
in
color
a
high
brick
wall
surrounding
it
frequently
temple
and
riddle
would
play
at
cards
there
of
an
afternoon
and
when
that
musical
unbelieving
laugh
of
hers
came
floating
over
the
wall
nick
would
say
mamma
is
once
we
heard
high
words
between
the
two
and
running
into
the
garden
found
the
cards
scattered
on
the
grass
and
the
couple
gone
of
all
nick
s
escapades
and
he
was
continually
in
and
out
of
them
i
recall
only
a
few
of
the
more
serious
as
i
have
said
he
was
a
wild
lad
sobered
by
none
of
the
things
which
had
gone
to
make
my
life
and
what
he
took
into
his
head
to
do
he
generally
did
or
if
balked
flew
into
such
a
rage
as
to
make
one
believe
he
could
not
live
life
was
always
war
with
him
or
some
semblance
of
a
struggle
of
his
many
wild
doings
i
recall
well
the
time
when
fired
by
my
tales
of
hunting
he
went
out
to
attack
the
young
bull
in
the
paddock
with
a
bow
and
arrow
it
made
small
difference
to
the
bull
that
the
arrow
was
too
blunt
to
enter
his
hide
with
a
bellow
that
frightened
the
idle
negroes
at
the
slave
quarters
he
started
for
master
nick
i
who
had
been
taught
by
my
father
never
to
run
any
unnecessary
risk
had
taken
the
precaution
to
provide
as
large
a
stone
as
i
could
comfortably
throw
and
took
station
on
the
fence
as
the
furious
animal
came
charging
with
his
head
lowered
i
struck
him
by
a
good
fortune
between
the
eyes
and
nicholas
got
over
we
were
standing
on
the
far
side
watching
him
pawing
the
broken
bow
when
in
the
crowd
of
frightened
negroes
we
discovered
the
parson
beside
us
david
said
he
patting
me
with
a
shaking
hand
i
perceive
that
you
have
a
cool
head
our
young
friend
here
has
a
hot
one
johnson
may
not
care
for
scotch
blood
and
yet
i
think
a
wee
bit
of
it
is
not
to
be
i
wondered
whether
johnson
was
staying
in
the
house
too
how
many
slaves
there
were
at
temple
bow
i
know
not
but
we
used
to
see
them
coming
home
at
night
in
droves
the
overseers
riding
beside
them
with
whips
and
guns
one
day
a
huge
congo
chief
not
long
from
africa
nearly
killed
an
overseer
and
escaped
to
the
swamp
as
the
day
fell
we
heard
the
baying
of
the
bloodhounds
hot
upon
his
trail
more
ominous
still
a
sound
like
a
rising
wind
came
from
the
direction
of
the
quarters
into
our
little
burst
temple
herself
slamming
the
door
behind
her
mason
who
was
sitting
with
us
rose
to
calm
her
the
rebels
she
cried
the
rebels
have
taught
them
this
with
their
accursed
notions
of
liberty
and
equality
we
shall
all
be
murdered
by
the
blacks
because
of
the
rebels
oh
is
too
good
for
them
have
the
house
barred
and
a
watch
set
what
shall
we
do
i
pray
you
compose
yourself
madame
said
the
clergyman
we
can
send
for
the
the
militia
she
shrieked
the
rebel
militia
they
would
murder
us
as
soon
as
the
they
are
respectable
men
answered
mason
and
were
at
fanning
hall
i
would
rather
be
killed
by
whites
than
blacks
said
the
lady
but
who
is
to
go
for
the
militia
i
will
ride
for
them
said
mason
it
was
a
dark
lowering
night
and
spitting
rain
and
leave
me
defenceless
she
cried
you
do
not
stir
it
is
a
pity
said
mason
he
was
goaded
to
it
i
suppose
tis
a
pity
riddle
did
not
come
she
shot
at
him
a
withering
look
for
even
in
her
fear
she
would
brook
no
liberties
nick
spoke
up
i
will
go
said
he
i
can
get
through
the
woods
to
fanning
hall
and
i
will
go
with
him
i
said
let
the
brats
go
she
said
and
cut
short
mason
s
expostulations
she
drew
nick
to
her
and
kissed
him
he
wriggled
away
and
without
more
ado
we
climbed
out
of
the
windows
into
the
night
running
across
the
lawn
we
left
the
lights
of
the
great
house
twinkling
behind
us
in
the
rain
we
had
to
pass
the
long
line
of
cabins
at
the
quarters
three
overseers
with
lanterns
stood
guard
there
the
cabins
were
dark
the
wretches
within
silent
and
cowed
thence
we
felt
with
our
feet
for
the
path
across
the
fields
stumbled
over
a
sty
and
took
our
way
through
the
black
woods
i
was
at
home
here
and
nick
was
not
to
be
frightened
at
intervals
the
mournful
bay
of
a
bloodhound
came
to
us
from
a
distance
suppose
we
should
meet
the
congo
chief
said
nick
suddenly
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
she
needn
t
have
been
so
frightened
said
he
in
scornful
remembrance
of
his
mother
s
actions
we
pressed
on
nick
knew
the
path
as
only
a
boy
can
half
an
hour
passed
it
grew
brighter
the
rain
ceased
and
a
new
moon
shot
out
between
the
leaves
i
seized
his
arm
what
s
that
i
whispered
a
but
i
cradled
in
woodcraft
had
heard
plainly
a
man
creeping
through
the
underbrush
beside
us
fear
of
the
congo
chief
and
pity
for
the
wretch
tore
at
my
heart
suddenly
there
loomed
in
front
of
us
on
the
path
a
great
naked
man
we
stood
with
useless
limbs
staring
at
him
then
from
the
trees
over
our
heads
came
a
chittering
and
a
chattering
such
as
i
had
never
heard
the
big
man
before
us
dropped
to
the
earth
his
head
bowed
muttering
as
for
me
my
fright
increased
the
chattering
stopped
and
nick
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
negro
s
bare
shoulder
we
needn
t
be
afraid
of
him
now
davy
he
said
i
learned
that
trick
from
a
portuguese
overseer
we
had
last
you
did
it
i
exclaimed
my
astonishment
overcoming
my
fear
it
s
the
way
the
monkeys
chatter
in
the
canaries
he
said
manuel
had
a
tame
one
and
i
heard
it
talk
once
before
i
tried
it
on
the
chief
and
he
fell
down
he
thinks
i
m
a
it
must
have
been
a
weird
scene
to
see
the
great
negro
following
two
boys
in
the
moonlight
indeed
he
came
after
us
like
a
dog
at
length
we
were
in
sight
of
the
lights
of
fanning
hall
the
militia
was
there
we
were
challenged
by
the
guard
and
caused
sufficient
amazement
when
we
appeared
in
the
hall
before
the
master
who
was
a
bachelor
of
fifty
sblood
nick
temple
he
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
with
that
big
congo
for
a
dog
the
sight
of
him
frightens
the
negro
indeed
was
a
sight
to
frighten
one
the
black
mud
of
the
swamps
was
caked
on
him
and
his
flesh
was
torn
by
brambles
he
ran
away
said
nick
and
i
am
taking
him
you
you
are
taking
him
home
sputtered
fanning
do
you
want
to
see
him
act
said
nick
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
he
filled
the
hall
with
a
dozen
monkeys
fanning
leaped
back
into
a
doorway
but
the
chief
prostrated
himself
on
the
floor
now
do
you
believe
i
can
take
him
home
said
nick
swounds
said
fanning
when
he
had
his
breath
you
beat
the
devil
nicholas
temple
the
next
time
you
come
to
call
i
pray
you
leave
your
travelling
show
at
mamma
sent
me
for
the
militia
said
nick
she
did
said
fanning
looking
grim
an
insurrection
is
a
bad
thing
but
there
was
no
danger
for
two
lads
in
the
woods
i
there
s
no
danger
anyway
said
nick
the
niggers
are
all
scared
to
fanning
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
stopped
suddenly
sat
down
and
took
nick
on
his
knee
it
was
an
incongruous
scene
fanning
almost
cried
bless
your
soul
he
said
but
you
are
a
lad
would
to
god
i
had
you
instead
of
he
paused
abruptly
i
must
go
home
said
nick
she
will
be
she
will
be
worried
cried
fanning
in
a
burst
of
anger
then
he
said
you
shall
have
the
militia
you
shall
have
the
he
rang
a
bell
and
sent
his
steward
for
the
captain
a
gawky
country
farmer
who
gave
a
gasp
when
he
came
upon
the
scene
in
the
hall
and
mind
said
nick
to
the
captain
you
are
to
keep
your
men
away
from
him
or
he
will
kill
one
of
the
captain
grinned
at
him
curiously
i
reckon
i
won
t
have
to
tell
them
to
keep
away
said
he
fanning
started
us
off
for
the
walk
with
pockets
filled
with
sweetmeats
which
we
nibbled
on
the
way
back
we
made
a
queer
procession
nick
and
i
striding
ahead
to
show
the
path
followed
by
the
now
servile
chief
and
after
him
the
captain
and
his
twenty
men
in
single
file
it
was
midnight
when
we
saw
the
lights
of
temple
bow
through
the
trees
one
of
the
tired
overseers
met
us
near
the
kitchen
when
he
perceived
the
congo
his
face
lighted
up
with
rage
and
he
instinctively
reached
for
his
whip
but
the
chief
stood
before
him
immovable
with
arms
folded
and
a
look
on
his
face
that
meant
danger
he
will
kill
you
emory
said
nick
he
will
kill
you
if
you
touch
emory
dropped
his
hand
limply
he
will
go
to
work
in
the
morning
said
nick
but
mind
you
not
a
very
good
master
nick
said
the
man
but
who
s
to
get
him
in
his
cabin
i
will
said
nick
he
beckoned
to
the
congo
who
followed
him
over
to
quarters
and
went
in
at
his
door
without
a
protest
the
next
morning
temple
looked
out
of
her
window
and
saw
the
militiamen
on
the
lawn
pooh
she
said
are
those
butternuts
the
soldiers
that
nick
went
to
fetch
chapter
cram
s
hell
after
that
my
admiration
for
nick
temple
increased
greatly
whether
excited
by
his
courage
and
presence
of
mind
or
his
ability
to
imitate
men
and
women
and
creatures
i
know
not
one
of
our
amusements
i
recall
was
to
go
to
the
congo
s
cabin
to
see
him
fall
on
his
face
until
mason
put
a
stop
to
it
the
clergyman
let
us
know
that
we
were
encouraging
idolatry
and
he
himself
took
the
chief
in
hand
another
incident
comes
to
me
from
those
bygone
days
the
fear
of
negro
insurrections
at
the
neighboring
plantations
being
temporarily
lulled
the
gentry
began
to
pluck
up
courage
for
their
usual
amusements
there
were
to
be
races
at
some
place
a
distance
away
and
nick
was
determined
to
go
had
he
not
determined
that
i
should
go
all
would
have
been
well
the
evening
before
he
came
upon
his
mother
in
the
garden
strange
to
say
she
was
in
a
gracious
mood
and
alone
come
and
kiss
me
nick
she
said
now
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
go
to
the
races
he
said
you
have
your
pony
you
can
follow
the
david
is
to
ride
the
pony
said
nick
generously
may
i
go
in
the
coach
no
she
said
there
is
no
room
for
nicholas
flared
up
harry
riddle
is
going
in
the
coach
i
don
t
see
why
you
can
t
take
me
sometimes
you
like
him
better
than
the
lady
flushed
very
red
how
dare
you
nick
she
cried
angrily
what
has
mason
been
putting
into
your
head
nothing
said
nick
quite
as
angrily
any
one
can
see
that
you
like
harry
and
i
will
ride
in
the
you
ll
not
said
his
mother
i
had
heard
nothing
of
this
the
next
morning
he
led
out
his
pony
from
the
stables
for
me
to
ride
and
insisted
and
supposing
he
was
to
go
in
the
coach
i
put
foot
in
the
stirrup
the
little
beast
would
scarce
stand
still
for
me
to
mount
you
ll
not
need
the
whip
with
her
said
nick
and
led
her
around
by
the
side
of
the
house
in
view
of
the
portico
and
stood
there
at
her
bridle
presently
with
a
great
noise
and
clatter
of
hoofs
the
coach
rounded
the
drive
the
powdered
negro
coachman
pulling
up
the
four
horses
with
much
ceremony
at
the
door
it
was
a
wondrous
great
vehicle
the
bright
colors
of
its
body
flashing
in
the
morning
light
i
had
examined
it
more
than
once
and
with
awe
in
the
it
had
glass
windows
and
a
lion
on
a
blue
shield
on
the
door
and
within
it
was
all
salmon
silk
save
the
painted
design
on
the
ceiling
great
leather
straps
held
up
this
house
on
wheels
to
take
the
jolts
of
the
road
and
behind
it
was
a
platform
that
morning
two
young
negroes
with
flowing
blue
coats
stood
on
it
they
leaped
to
the
ground
when
the
coach
stopped
and
stood
each
side
of
the
door
waiting
for
my
lady
to
enter
she
came
down
the
steps
laughing
with
riddle
who
was
in
his
riding
clothes
for
he
was
to
race
that
day
he
handed
her
in
and
got
in
after
her
the
coachman
cracked
his
whip
the
coach
creaked
off
down
the
drive
i
in
the
trees
one
side
waiting
for
them
to
pass
and
wondering
what
nick
was
to
do
he
had
let
go
my
bridle
folded
his
whip
in
his
hand
and
with
a
shout
of
come
on
davy
he
ran
for
the
coach
which
was
going
slowly
caught
hold
of
the
footman
s
platform
and
pulled
himself
up
what
possessed
the
footman
i
know
not
perchance
fear
of
his
mistress
was
greater
than
fear
of
his
young
master
but
he
took
the
lad
by
the
shoulders
gently
to
be
sure
and
pushed
him
into
the
road
where
he
fell
and
rolled
over
i
guessed
what
would
happen
picking
himself
up
nick
was
at
the
man
like
a
hurricane
seizing
him
swiftly
by
the
leg
the
negro
fell
upon
the
platform
clutching
wildly
where
he
lay
in
a
sheer
fright
shrieking
for
mercy
his
cries
rivalled
by
those
of
the
lady
within
the
coachman
frantically
pulled
his
horses
to
a
stand
the
other
footman
jumped
off
and
harry
riddle
came
flying
out
of
the
coach
door
to
behold
nicholas
beating
the
negro
with
his
you
young
devil
cried
riddle
angrily
striding
forward
what
are
you
doing
keep
off
harry
said
nicholas
i
am
teaching
this
nigger
that
he
is
not
to
lay
hands
on
his
with
that
he
gave
the
boy
one
more
cut
and
turned
from
him
contemptuously
what
is
it
harry
came
in
a
shrill
voice
from
within
the
coach
it
s
nick
s
pranks
said
riddle
grinning
in
spite
of
his
anger
he
s
ruined
one
of
your
footmen
you
little
scoundrel
cried
riddle
advancing
again
you
ve
frightened
your
mother
nearly
to
a
serves
her
right
said
nick
what
cried
riddle
come
down
from
there
nick
raised
his
whip
it
was
not
that
that
stopped
riddle
but
a
sign
about
the
lad
s
nostrils
harry
riddle
said
the
boy
if
it
weren
t
for
you
i
d
be
riding
in
this
coach
with
my
mother
i
don
t
want
to
ride
with
her
but
i
will
go
to
the
races
if
you
try
to
take
me
down
i
ll
do
my
best
to
kill
you
and
he
lifted
the
loaded
end
of
the
whip
temple
s
beautiful
face
had
by
this
time
been
thrust
out
of
the
door
for
the
love
of
heaven
harry
let
him
come
in
with
us
we
re
late
enough
as
it
riddle
turned
on
his
heel
he
tried
to
glare
at
nick
but
he
broke
into
a
laugh
instead
come
down
satan
says
he
god
help
the
woman
you
love
and
the
man
you
and
so
nicholas
jumped
down
and
into
the
coach
the
footman
picked
himself
up
more
scared
than
injured
and
the
vehicle
took
its
lumbering
way
for
the
i
following
i
have
seen
many
courses
since
but
none
to
equal
that
in
the
gorgeous
dress
of
those
who
watched
there
had
been
many
many
more
in
former
years
so
i
heard
people
say
this
was
the
only
sign
that
a
war
was
in
progress
the
scanty
number
of
gentry
present
for
all
save
the
indifferent
were
gone
to
charlestown
or
elsewhere
i
recall
it
dimly
as
a
blaze
of
color
passing
merrymaking
jesting
feasting
a
rare
contrast
i
thought
to
the
sight
i
had
beheld
in
charlestown
bay
but
a
while
before
yet
so
runs
the
world
strife
at
one
man
s
home
and
peace
and
contentment
at
his
neighbor
s
sorrow
here
and
rejoicing
not
a
league
away
master
nicholas
played
one
prank
that
evening
that
was
near
to
costing
dear
my
lady
temple
made
up
a
party
for
temple
bow
at
the
course
two
other
coaches
to
come
and
some
gentlemen
riding
as
nick
and
i
were
running
through
the
paddock
we
came
suddenly
upon
harry
riddle
and
a
stout
swarthy
gentleman
standing
together
the
stout
gentleman
was
counting
out
big
gold
pieces
in
his
hand
and
giving
them
to
riddle
lucky
dog
said
the
stout
gentleman
you
ll
ride
back
with
her
and
you
ve
won
all
i
ve
and
he
dug
riddle
in
the
ribs
you
ll
have
it
again
when
we
play
darnley
answered
riddle
crossly
and
as
for
the
seat
in
the
coach
you
are
welcome
to
it
that
firebrand
of
a
lad
is
on
the
front
d
n
the
lad
said
the
stout
gentleman
i
ll
take
it
and
you
can
ride
my
horse
he
ll
he
ll
carry
you
i
his
voice
had
a
way
of
cracking
into
a
mellow
laugh
at
that
riddle
went
off
in
a
towering
bad
humor
and
afterwards
i
heard
him
cursing
the
stout
gentleman
s
black
groom
as
he
mounted
his
great
horse
and
then
he
cursed
the
horse
as
it
reared
and
plunged
while
the
stout
gentleman
stood
at
the
coach
door
cackling
at
his
discomfiture
the
gentleman
did
ride
home
with
temple
nick
going
into
another
coach
i
afterwards
discovered
that
the
gentleman
had
bribed
him
with
a
guinea
and
riddle
more
than
once
came
near
running
down
my
pony
on
his
big
charger
and
he
swore
at
me
roundly
too
that
night
there
was
a
gay
supper
party
in
the
big
dining
room
at
temple
bow
nick
and
i
looked
on
from
the
gallery
window
it
was
a
pretty
sight
the
long
mahogany
board
reflecting
the
yellow
flames
of
the
candles
and
spread
with
bright
silver
and
shining
dishes
loaded
with
dainties
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
in
brilliant
dress
the
hurrying
servants
all
were
of
a
new
and
strange
world
to
me
and
presently
after
the
ladies
were
gone
the
gentlemen
tossed
off
their
wine
and
roared
over
their
jokes
and
followed
into
the
this
i
noticed
that
only
harry
riddle
sat
silent
and
morose
and
that
he
had
drunk
more
than
the
others
come
davy
said
nick
to
me
let
s
go
and
watch
them
but
how
i
asked
for
the
windows
were
up
some
distance
from
the
ground
and
there
was
no
gallery
on
that
side
i
ll
show
you
said
he
running
into
the
garden
after
searching
awhile
in
the
dark
he
found
a
ladder
the
gardener
had
left
against
a
tree
after
much
straining
we
carried
the
ladder
to
the
house
and
set
it
up
under
one
of
the
windows
of
the
then
we
both
clambered
cautiously
to
the
top
and
looked
in
the
company
were
at
cards
silent
save
for
a
low
remark
now
and
again
the
little
tables
were
ranged
along
by
the
windows
and
it
chanced
that
harry
riddle
sat
so
close
to
us
that
we
could
touch
him
on
his
right
sat
darnley
the
stout
gentleman
and
in
the
other
seats
two
ladies
between
riddle
and
darnley
was
a
pile
of
silver
and
gold
pieces
there
was
not
room
for
two
of
us
in
comfort
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
so
i
gave
place
to
nick
and
sat
on
a
lower
rung
presently
i
saw
him
raise
himself
reach
in
and
duck
quickly
feel
that
he
whispered
to
me
chuckling
and
holding
out
his
hand
it
was
full
of
money
but
that
s
stealing
nick
i
said
frightened
of
course
i
ll
give
it
back
he
whispered
indignantly
instantly
there
came
loud
words
and
the
scraping
of
chairs
within
the
room
and
a
woman
s
scream
i
heard
riddle
s
voice
say
thickly
amid
the
silence
that
followed
mr
darnley
you
re
a
d
d
thief
you
shall
answer
for
this
when
you
are
sober
sir
said
darnley
then
there
came
more
scraping
of
chairs
all
the
company
talking
excitedly
at
once
nick
and
i
scrambled
to
the
ground
and
we
did
the
very
worst
thing
we
could
possibly
have
done
we
took
the
ladder
away
there
was
little
sleep
for
me
that
night
i
had
first
of
all
besought
nick
to
go
up
into
the
and
give
the
money
back
but
some
strange
obstinacy
in
him
resisted
twill
serve
harry
well
for
what
he
did
said
he
my
next
thought
was
to
find
mason
but
he
was
gone
up
the
river
to
visit
a
sick
parishioner
i
had
seen
enough
of
the
world
to
know
that
gentlemen
fought
for
less
than
what
had
occurred
in
the
that
evening
and
though
i
had
neither
love
nor
admiration
for
riddle
and
though
the
stout
gentleman
was
no
friend
of
mine
i
cared
not
to
see
either
of
them
killed
for
a
prank
but
nick
would
not
listen
to
me
and
went
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
my
urgings
davy
said
he
pinching
me
do
you
know
what
you
are
no
said
i
you
re
a
granny
he
said
and
that
was
the
last
word
i
could
get
out
of
him
but
i
lay
awake
a
long
time
thinking
breed
had
whiled
away
for
me
one
hot
morning
in
charlestown
with
an
account
of
the
gentry
and
their
doings
many
of
which
he
related
in
an
awed
whisper
that
i
could
not
understand
they
were
wild
doings
indeed
to
me
but
strangest
of
all
seemed
the
duels
conducted
with
a
decorum
and
ceremony
as
rigorous
as
the
law
did
you
ever
see
a
duel
breed
i
had
asked
yessah
said
breed
dramatically
rolling
the
whites
of
his
eyes
where
whah
down
on
de
riveh
bank
at
temple
bow
in
de
ea
ly
mo
nin
dey
mos
commonly
fights
at
de
breed
had
also
told
me
where
he
was
in
hiding
at
the
time
and
that
was
what
troubled
me
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
remember
it
had
sounded
like
clam
shell
that
i
recalled
and
how
breed
had
looked
out
at
the
through
the
cracks
of
the
closed
shutters
agonized
between
fear
of
ghosts
within
and
the
drama
without
at
the
first
faint
light
that
came
into
our
window
i
awakened
nick
listen
i
said
do
you
know
a
place
called
clam
shell
he
turned
over
but
i
punched
him
persistently
until
he
sat
up
what
the
deuce
ails
you
davy
he
asked
rubbing
his
eyes
have
you
nightmare
do
you
know
a
place
called
clam
shell
down
on
the
river
bank
nick
why
he
replied
you
must
be
thinking
of
cram
s
what
s
that
i
asked
it
s
a
house
that
used
to
belong
to
cram
who
was
an
overseer
the
niggers
hated
him
and
he
was
killed
in
bed
by
a
big
black
nigger
chief
from
africa
the
niggers
won
t
go
near
the
place
they
say
it
s
get
up
said
i
we
re
going
there
nick
sprang
out
of
bed
and
began
to
get
into
his
clothes
is
it
a
game
he
asked
he
was
always
ready
for
a
game
we
climbed
out
of
the
window
and
made
our
way
in
the
mist
through
the
long
wet
grass
nick
leading
he
took
a
path
through
a
dark
forest
swamp
over
logs
that
spanned
the
stagnant
waters
and
at
length
just
as
the
mist
was
growing
pearly
in
the
light
we
came
out
at
a
house
that
stood
in
an
open
glade
by
the
river
s
bank
what
s
to
do
now
said
nick
we
must
get
into
the
house
i
answered
but
i
confess
i
didn
t
care
for
the
looks
of
it
nick
stared
at
me
very
good
davy
he
said
i
ll
follow
where
you
it
was
a
saturday
morning
why
i
recall
this
i
do
not
know
it
has
no
special
significance
i
tried
the
door
with
a
groan
and
a
shriek
it
gave
way
disclosing
the
blackness
inside
we
started
back
involuntarily
i
looked
at
nick
and
nick
at
me
he
was
very
pale
and
so
must
i
have
been
but
such
was
the
respect
we
each
held
for
the
other
s
courage
that
neither
dared
flinch
and
so
i
walked
in
although
it
seemed
as
if
my
shirt
was
made
of
needle
points
and
my
hair
stood
on
end
the
crackings
of
the
old
floor
were
to
me
like
the
shots
in
charlestown
bay
our
hearts
beating
wildly
we
made
our
way
into
a
farther
room
it
was
like
walking
into
the
beyond
is
there
a
window
here
i
asked
nick
my
voice
sounding
like
a
shout
yes
ahead
of
groping
for
it
i
suddenly
received
a
shock
that
set
me
reeling
human
nature
could
stand
no
more
we
both
turned
tail
and
ran
out
of
the
house
as
fast
as
we
could
and
stood
in
the
wet
grass
panting
then
shame
came
let
s
open
the
window
first
i
suggested
so
we
walked
around
the
house
and
pried
the
solid
shutter
from
its
fastenings
then
gathering
our
courage
we
went
in
again
at
the
door
in
the
dim
light
let
into
the
farther
room
we
saw
a
bed
old
and
cheap
with
ragged
curtains
it
was
this
that
i
had
struck
in
my
groping
the
chief
killed
cram
there
said
nick
in
an
awed
voice
in
that
bed
what
do
you
want
to
do
here
davy
wait
i
said
though
i
had
as
little
mind
to
wait
as
ever
in
my
life
stand
here
by
the
we
waited
there
the
mist
rose
the
sun
peeped
over
the
bank
of
dense
green
forest
and
spread
rainbow
colors
on
the
still
waters
of
the
river
now
and
again
a
fish
broke
or
a
great
bird
swooped
down
and
slit
the
surface
a
snatch
of
melody
came
to
our
ears
the
slaves
were
going
to
work
nothing
more
and
little
by
little
grave
misgivings
gnawed
at
my
soul
of
the
wisdom
of
coming
to
this
place
doubtless
there
were
many
other
spots
davy
said
nick
at
last
i
m
sorry
i
took
that
money
what
are
we
here
for
hush
i
whispered
do
you
hear
anything
i
did
and
distinctly
for
i
had
been
brought
up
in
the
forest
i
hear
voices
he
said
presently
coming
this
they
were
very
clear
to
me
by
then
emerging
from
the
forest
path
were
five
gentlemen
the
leader
more
plainly
dressed
than
the
others
carried
a
leather
case
behind
him
was
the
stout
figure
of
darnley
his
face
solemn
and
last
of
all
came
harry
riddle
very
pale
but
cutting
the
tops
of
the
long
grass
with
a
switch
nick
seized
my
arm
they
are
going
to
fight
said
he
yes
i
replied
and
we
are
here
to
stop
them
no
not
now
he
said
holding
me
still
we
ll
have
some
more
fun
out
of
this
fun
i
echoed
yes
he
said
excitedly
leave
it
to
me
i
shan
t
let
them
and
that
instant
we
changed
generals
david
giving
place
to
nicholas
riddle
retired
with
one
gentleman
to
a
side
of
the
little
patch
of
grass
and
darnley
and
a
friend
to
another
the
fifth
gentleman
took
a
position
halfway
between
the
two
and
opening
the
leather
case
laid
it
down
on
the
grass
where
its
contents
glistened
that
s
ball
whispered
nick
and
his
voice
shook
with
excitement
riddle
stripped
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
and
ruffles
and
his
and
darnley
did
the
same
both
gentlemen
drew
their
swords
and
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
lawn
and
stood
opposite
one
another
with
flowing
linen
shirts
open
at
the
throat
and
bared
heads
they
were
indeed
a
contrast
riddle
tall
and
white
with
closed
lips
glared
at
his
opponent
darnley
cut
a
merrier
figure
rotund
and
flushed
with
fat
calves
and
short
arms
though
his
countenance
was
sober
enough
all
at
once
the
two
were
circling
their
swords
in
the
air
and
then
nick
had
flung
open
the
shutter
and
leaped
through
the
window
and
was
running
and
shouting
towards
the
astonished
gentlemen
all
of
whom
wheeled
to
face
him
he
jingled
as
he
ran
what
in
the
devil
s
name
now
cried
riddle
angrily
here
s
this
imp
nicholas
stopped
in
front
of
him
and
thrusting
his
hand
in
his
breeches
pocket
fished
out
a
handful
of
gold
and
silver
which
he
held
out
to
the
confounded
riddle
harry
said
he
here
s
something
of
yours
i
found
last
you
found
echoed
riddle
in
a
strange
voice
amidst
a
dead
silence
you
found
where
on
the
table
beside
and
where
the
deuce
were
you
riddle
demanded
in
the
window
behind
you
said
nick
calmly
this
piece
of
information
to
riddle
s
plain
discomfiture
was
greeted
with
a
roar
of
laughter
darnley
himself
laughing
loudest
nor
were
these
gentlemen
satisfied
with
that
they
crowded
around
riddle
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
darnley
joining
in
with
the
rest
and
presently
riddle
flung
away
his
sword
and
laughed
too
giving
his
hand
to
darnley
at
length
darnley
turned
to
nick
who
had
stood
all
this
while
behind
them
unmoved
my
friend
said
he
seriously
such
is
your
regard
for
human
life
you
will
probably
one
day
be
a
pirate
or
an
outlaw
this
time
we
ve
had
a
laugh
the
next
time
somebody
will
be
weeping
i
wish
i
were
your
i
wish
you
were
said
nick
this
took
darnley
s
breath
he
glanced
at
the
other
gentlemen
who
returned
his
look
significantly
he
laid
his
hand
kindly
on
the
lad
s
head
nick
said
he
i
wish
to
god
i
were
your
after
that
they
all
went
home
very
merry
to
breakfast
nick
and
i
coming
after
them
nick
was
silent
until
we
reached
the
house
davy
said
he
then
how
old
are
you
ten
i
answered
how
old
did
you
believe
me
eighty
said
he
the
next
day
being
sunday
we
all
gathered
in
the
little
church
to
hear
mason
preach
nick
and
i
sat
in
the
high
box
pew
of
the
family
with
temple
who
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
the
sermon
as
for
me
the
rhythm
of
it
held
me
in
fascination
mason
had
written
it
out
and
that
afternoon
read
over
this
part
of
it
to
nick
the
quotation
i
recall
having
since
read
it
many
times
and
the
gist
of
it
was
in
this
wise
and
he
said
unto
him
what
thou
wilt
have
thou
wilt
have
despite
the
sin
of
it
blessed
are
the
stolid
and
thrice
cursed
he
who
hath
imagination
for
that
imagination
shall
devour
him
and
in
thy
life
a
sin
shall
be
presented
unto
thee
with
a
great
longing
god
who
is
in
heaven
gird
thee
for
that
struggle
my
son
for
it
will
surely
come
that
it
may
be
said
of
you
behold
i
have
refined
thee
but
not
with
silver
i
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
seven
days
shalt
thou
wrestle
with
thy
soul
seven
nights
shall
evil
haunt
thee
and
how
thou
shalt
come
forth
from
that
struggle
no
man
may
chapter
vi
man
proposes
but
god
disposes
a
week
passed
and
another
sunday
came
a
sunday
so
still
and
hot
and
moist
that
steam
seemed
to
rise
from
the
heavy
trees
an
idle
day
for
master
and
servant
alike
a
hush
was
in
the
air
and
a
presage
of
we
knew
not
what
it
weighed
upon
my
spirits
and
even
nick
s
and
we
wandered
restlessly
under
the
trees
seeking
for
distraction
about
two
o
clock
a
black
line
came
on
the
horizon
and
slowly
crept
higher
until
it
broke
into
giant
fantastic
shapes
mutterings
arose
but
the
sun
shone
hot
as
ever
we
re
to
have
a
hurricane
said
nick
i
wish
we
might
have
it
and
be
done
with
at
five
the
sun
went
under
i
remember
that
madame
was
lolling
listless
in
the
garden
daintily
arrayed
in
fine
linen
trying
to
talk
to
mason
when
a
sound
startled
us
it
was
the
sound
of
swift
hoof
beats
on
the
soft
drive
temple
got
up
an
unusual
thing
perchance
she
was
expecting
a
message
from
some
of
the
gentlemen
or
else
she
may
well
have
been
tired
of
mason
nick
and
i
were
before
her
and
running
through
the
house
arrived
at
the
portico
in
time
to
see
a
negro
ride
up
on
a
horse
covered
with
lather
it
was
the
same
negro
who
had
fetched
me
hither
from
lowndes
and
when
i
saw
him
my
heart
stood
still
lest
he
had
brought
news
of
my
father
what
s
to
do
boy
cried
nicholas
to
him
the
boy
held
in
his
hand
a
letter
with
a
great
red
seal
fo
mistis
temple
he
said
and
looking
at
me
queerly
he
took
off
his
cap
as
he
jumped
from
the
horse
mistress
temple
herself
having
arrived
he
handed
her
the
letter
she
took
it
and
broke
the
seal
carelessly
oh
she
said
it
s
only
from
lowndes
i
wonder
what
he
wishes
every
moment
of
her
reading
was
for
me
an
agony
and
she
read
slowly
the
last
words
she
spoke
aloud
if
you
do
not
wish
the
lad
send
him
to
me
as
kate
is
very
fond
of
so
kate
is
very
fond
of
him
she
repeated
and
handing
the
letter
to
mason
she
added
tell
him
the
words
burned
into
my
soul
and
seared
it
and
to
this
day
i
tremble
with
anger
as
i
think
of
them
the
scene
comes
before
me
the
sky
the
darkened
portico
and
nicholas
running
after
his
mother
crying
oh
mamma
how
could
you
how
could
you
mason
bent
over
me
in
compassion
and
smoothed
my
hair
david
said
he
in
a
thick
voice
you
are
a
brave
boy
david
you
will
need
all
your
courage
now
my
son
may
god
keep
your
nature
sweet
he
led
me
gently
into
the
arbor
and
told
me
how
under
captain
baskin
the
detachment
had
been
ambushed
by
the
cherokees
and
how
my
father
with
ensign
calhoun
and
another
had
been
killed
fighting
bravely
the
rest
of
the
company
had
cut
their
way
through
and
reached
the
settlements
after
terrible
hardships
i
was
left
an
orphan
i
shall
not
dwell
here
on
the
bitterness
of
those
moments
we
have
all
known
sorrows
in
our
lives
great
sorrows
the
clergyman
was
a
wise
man
and
did
not
strive
to
comfort
me
with
words
but
he
sat
there
under
the
leaves
with
his
arm
about
me
until
a
blinding
bolt
split
the
blackness
of
the
sky
and
the
thunder
rent
our
ears
and
a
caribbean
storm
broke
over
temple
bow
with
all
the
fury
of
the
tropics
then
he
led
me
through
the
drenching
rain
into
the
house
nor
heeded
the
wet
himself
on
his
sunday
coat
a
great
anger
stayed
me
in
my
sorrow
i
would
no
longer
tarry
under
temple
s
roof
though
the
world
without
were
a
sea
or
a
desert
the
one
resolution
to
escape
rose
stronger
and
stronger
within
me
and
i
determined
neither
to
eat
nor
sleep
until
i
had
got
away
the
thought
of
leaving
nick
was
heavy
indeed
and
when
he
ran
to
me
in
the
dark
hall
and
threw
his
arms
around
me
it
needed
all
my
strength
to
keep
from
crying
aloud
davy
he
said
passionately
davy
you
mustn
t
mind
what
she
says
she
never
means
anything
she
says
she
never
cares
for
anything
save
her
pleasure
you
and
i
will
stay
here
until
we
are
old
enough
to
run
away
to
kentucky
davy
answer
me
davy
i
could
not
try
as
i
would
there
were
no
words
that
would
come
with
honesty
but
i
pulled
him
down
on
the
mahogany
settle
near
the
door
which
led
into
the
back
gallery
and
there
we
sat
huddled
together
in
silence
while
the
storm
raged
furiously
outside
and
the
draughts
banged
the
great
doors
of
the
house
in
the
lightning
flashes
i
saw
nick
s
face
and
it
haunted
me
afterwards
through
many
years
of
wandering
on
it
was
written
a
sorrow
for
me
greater
than
my
own
sorrow
for
god
had
given
to
this
lad
every
human
passion
and
compassion
the
storm
rolled
away
with
the
night
and
mammy
came
through
the
hall
with
a
candle
whah
is
you
marse
nick
whah
is
you
honey
you
suppah
s
and
so
we
went
into
our
little
dining
room
but
i
would
not
eat
the
good
old
negress
brushed
her
eyes
with
her
apron
as
she
pressed
a
cake
upon
me
she
had
made
herself
for
she
had
grown
fond
of
me
and
presently
we
went
away
silently
to
bed
it
was
a
long
long
time
before
nick
s
breathing
told
me
that
he
was
asleep
he
held
me
tightly
clutched
to
him
and
i
know
that
he
feared
i
would
leave
him
the
thought
of
going
broke
my
heart
but
i
never
once
wavered
in
my
resolve
and
i
lay
staring
into
the
darkness
pondering
what
to
do
i
thought
of
good
lowndes
and
his
wife
and
i
decided
to
go
to
charlestown
some
of
my
boyish
motives
come
back
to
me
now
i
should
be
near
nick
and
even
at
that
age
having
lived
a
life
of
i
thought
of
gaining
an
education
and
of
rising
to
a
place
of
trust
yes
i
would
go
to
lowndes
and
ask
him
to
let
me
work
for
him
and
so
earn
my
education
with
a
heavy
spirit
i
crept
out
of
bed
slowly
disengaging
nick
s
arm
lest
he
should
wake
he
turned
over
and
sighed
in
his
sleep
carefully
i
dressed
myself
and
after
i
was
dressed
i
could
not
refrain
from
slipping
to
the
bedside
to
bend
over
him
once
again
for
he
was
the
only
one
in
my
life
with
whom
i
had
found
true
companionship
then
i
climbed
carefully
out
of
the
window
and
so
down
the
corner
of
the
house
to
the
ground
it
was
starlight
and
a
waning
moon
hung
in
the
sky
i
made
my
way
through
the
drive
between
the
black
shadows
of
the
forest
and
came
at
length
to
the
big
gates
at
the
entrance
locked
for
the
night
a
strange
thought
of
their
futility
struck
me
as
i
climbed
the
rail
fence
beside
them
and
pushed
on
into
the
main
road
the
mud
sucking
under
my
shoes
as
i
went
as
i
try
now
to
cast
my
memory
back
i
can
recall
no
fear
only
a
vast
sense
of
loneliness
and
the
very
song
of
it
seemed
to
be
sung
in
never
ending
refrain
by
the
insects
of
the
night
i
had
been
alone
in
the
mountains
before
i
have
crossed
great
strips
of
wilderness
since
but
always
there
was
love
to
go
back
to
then
i
was
leaving
the
only
being
in
the
world
that
remained
to
me
i
must
have
walked
two
hours
or
more
before
i
came
to
the
mire
of
a
and
there
i
stood
in
a
quandary
of
doubt
as
to
which
side
led
to
charlestown
as
i
lingered
a
light
began
to
tremble
in
the
heavens
a
cock
crew
in
the
distance
i
sat
down
on
a
fallen
log
to
rest
but
presently
as
the
light
grew
i
heard
shouts
which
drew
nearer
and
deeper
and
brought
me
to
my
feet
in
an
uncertainty
of
expectation
next
came
the
rattling
of
chains
the
scramble
of
hoofs
in
the
mire
and
here
was
a
wagon
with
a
big
canvas
cover
beside
the
straining
horses
was
a
great
burly
man
with
a
red
beard
cracking
his
long
whip
and
calling
to
the
horses
in
a
strange
tongue
he
stopped
still
beside
his
panting
animals
when
he
saw
me
his
high
boots
sunk
in
the
mud
gut
morning
poy
he
said
wiping
his
red
face
with
his
sleeve
what
you
do
here
i
am
going
to
charlestown
i
answered
ach
he
cried
dot
is
pad
mein
poy
he
run
avay
you
are
ein
gut
poy
i
know
i
vill
pay
ein
gut
price
to
help
me
vit
mein
wagon
where
are
you
going
i
demanded
with
a
sudden
wavering
up
country
pack
country
you
know
der
proad
river
yes
no
i
did
not
but
a
longing
came
upon
me
for
the
old
backwoods
life
with
its
freedom
and
and
a
hatred
for
this
steaming
country
of
heat
and
violent
storms
and
artificiality
and
pomp
and
i
had
a
desire
even
at
that
age
to
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
what
will
you
give
me
i
asked
at
that
he
put
his
finger
to
his
nose
thruppence
py
the
i
shook
my
head
he
looked
at
me
queerly
how
old
you
pe
twelve
yes
now
i
had
no
notion
of
telling
him
so
i
said
is
this
the
charlestown
road
fourpence
he
cried
dot
is
i
will
go
for
sixpence
i
answered
mein
gott
he
cried
sixpence
dot
is
but
seeing
me
obdurate
he
added
i
vill
give
it
because
ein
poy
i
must
have
vat
is
your
name
tavid
you
are
ein
sharp
poy
and
so
i
went
with
him
in
writing
a
biography
the
relative
value
of
days
and
years
should
hold
there
are
days
which
count
in
space
for
years
and
years
for
days
i
spent
the
time
on
the
whole
happily
with
this
dutchman
whose
name
was
hans
köppel
he
talked
merrily
save
when
he
spoke
of
the
war
against
england
and
then
contemptuously
for
he
was
a
bitter
english
partisan
and
in
contrast
to
this
he
would
dwell
for
hours
on
a
king
he
called
friedrich
der
grosse
and
a
war
he
waged
that
was
a
war
and
how
this
mighty
king
had
fought
a
mighty
queen
at
rossbach
and
leuthen
in
his
own
country
battles
that
were
battles
and
you
were
there
hans
i
asked
him
once
ja
he
said
but
i
did
not
you
ran
away
ja
hans
would
answer
laughing
run
avay
i
love
peace
tavid
dot
is
vy
i
come
here
and
now
bitterly
and
now
ve
haf
var
again
i
would
say
nothing
but
i
must
have
looked
my
disapproval
for
he
went
on
to
explain
that
in
where
he
was
born
men
were
made
to
fight
whether
they
would
or
no
and
they
were
stolen
from
their
wives
at
night
by
soldiers
of
the
great
king
or
lured
away
by
fair
promises
travelling
with
incredible
slowness
in
due
time
we
came
to
a
county
called
orangeburg
where
all
were
dutchmen
like
hans
and
very
few
spoke
english
and
they
all
thought
like
hans
and
loved
peace
and
hated
the
congress
on
sundays
as
we
lay
over
at
the
taverns
these
would
be
filled
with
a
rollicking
crowd
of
fiddlers
and
dancers
quaintly
dressed
the
women
bringing
their
children
and
babies
at
such
times
hans
would
be
drunk
and
i
would
have
to
feed
the
tired
horses
and
mount
watch
over
the
cargo
i
had
many
adventures
but
none
worth
the
telling
here
and
at
length
we
came
to
hans
s
farm
in
a
prettily
rolling
country
on
the
broad
river
hans
s
wife
spoke
no
english
at
all
nor
did
the
brood
of
children
running
about
the
house
i
had
small
fancy
for
staying
in
such
a
place
and
so
hans
paid
me
two
crowns
for
my
three
weeks
service
i
think
with
real
regret
for
labor
was
scarce
in
those
parts
and
though
i
was
young
i
knew
how
to
work
and
i
could
at
least
have
guided
his
plough
in
the
furrow
and
cared
for
his
cattle
it
was
the
first
money
i
had
earned
in
my
life
and
a
prouder
day
than
many
i
have
had
since
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
passing
that
way
hans
kept
a
tavern
if
it
could
have
been
dignified
by
such
a
name
it
was
in
truth
merely
a
log
house
with
shakedowns
and
stood
across
the
rude
road
from
his
log
farmhouse
and
he
gave
me
leave
to
sleep
there
and
to
work
for
my
board
until
i
cared
to
leave
it
so
chanced
that
on
the
second
day
after
my
arrival
a
came
along
guided
by
a
nettlesome
old
man
and
a
strong
lass
of
sixteen
or
thereabouts
the
old
man
whose
name
was
ripley
wore
a
hunting
shirt
trimmed
with
red
cotton
and
he
had
no
sooner
slipped
the
packs
from
his
horses
than
he
began
to
rail
at
hans
who
stood
looking
on
you
damned
dutchmen
be
all
tories
and
worse
he
cried
you
stay
here
and
till
your
farms
while
our
boys
are
off
in
the
hill
towns
fighting
cherokees
i
wish
the
devils
had
every
one
of
your
fat
sculps
polly
ann
water
the
hans
replied
to
this
sally
with
great
vigor
lapsing
into
dutch
polly
ann
led
the
scrawny
ponies
to
the
trough
but
her
eyes
snapped
with
merriment
as
she
listened
she
was
a
wonderfully
comely
lass
despite
her
loose
cotton
gown
and
and
the
shoepacks
on
her
feet
she
had
blue
eyes
the
whitest
strongest
of
teeth
and
the
rosiest
of
faces
gran
pa
hates
a
dutchman
wuss
n
pizen
she
said
to
me
so

all

burned
out
and
sculped
up

and
they
never
give
us
so
much

man
or
a
measure
of
i
helped

the
animals
and

them
and

their
bells
for
the
night
and
carry
the
packs

she
demanded
suddenly
i
told
her

sat
down
on
a
log
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
pulled
me
down
beside
her
and
whar
be
you
from
i
told
her
it
was
impossible
to
look
into
her
face
and
not
tell
her
she
listened
eagerly
now
with
compassion
and
now
showing
her
white
teeth
in
amusement
and
when
i
had
done
much
to
my
discomfiture
she
seized
me
in
her
strong
arms
and
kissed
me
poor
davy
she
cried
you
ain
t
got
a
home
you
shall
come
home
with
catching
me
by
the
hand
she
ran
like
a
deer
across
the
road
to
where
her
grandfather
was
still
quarrelling
violently
with
hans
and
pulled
him
backward
by
the
skirts
of
his
hunting
shirt
i
looked
for
another
and
mightier
explosion
from
the
old
backwoodsman
but
to
my
astonishment
he
seemed
to
forget
hans
s
existence
and
turned
and
smiled
on
her
benevolently
polly
ann
said
he
what
be

about

to
her
she
said

wuthless

her

polly
ann
never
consulted
me
on
the
subject
nor
had
she
need
to
i
would
have
followed
her
to
kingdom
come
and
at
the
thought
of
reaching
the
mountains
my
heart
leaped
with
joy
we
all
slept
in
the
one
windowless
room
of
the
tavern
that
night
and
before
dawn
i
was
up
and
untethered
the
horses
and
polly
ann
and
i
together
lifted
the
two
bushels
of
alum
salt
on
one
of
the
beasts
and
the
ploughshare
on
the
other
by
daylight
we
had
left
hans
and
his
farm
forever
i
can
see
the
lass
now
as
she
strode
along
the
trace
by
the
flowing
river
through
sunlight
and
shadow
straight
and
supple
and
strong
sometimes
she
sang
like
a
bird
and
the
forest
rang
sometimes
she
would
make
fun
of
her
grandfather
or
of
me
and
again
she
would
be
silent
for
an
hour
at
a
time
staring
ahead
and
then
i
knew
she
was
thinking
of
that
tom
mcchesney
she
would
wake
from
those
reveries
with
a
laugh
and
give
me
a
push
to
send
me
rolling
down
a
bank
what
s
the
matter
davy
you
look
as
solemn
as
a
what
a
little
wiseacre
you
be
once
i
retorted
you
were
thinking
of
that
tom
ay
that
she
was
i
ll
warrant
snapped
her
grandfather
polly
ann
replied
with
a
merry
peal
of
laughter
you
are
both
jealous
of
tom
both
of
you
but
davy
when
you
see
him
you
ll
love
him
as
much
as
i
i
ll
not
i
said
sturdily
he
s
a
man
to
look
upon
he
s
a
old
man
ripley
put
in
ye
re
daft
about
that
i
am
said
polly
flushing
and
subsiding
but
he
ll
not
know
as
we
rose
into
the
more
rugged
country
we
passed
more
than
one
charred
cabin
that
told
its
silent
story
of
indian
massacre
only
on
the
scattered
hill
farms
women
and
boys
and
old
men
were
working
in
the
fields
all
save
the
scalawags
having
gone
to
join
rutherford
there
were
plenty
of
these
around
the
taverns
to
make
eyes
at
polly
ann
and
open
love
to
her
had
she
allowed
them
but
she
treated
them
in
return
to
such
scathing
tirades
that
they
were
glad
to
desist
all
but
one
he
must
have
been
an
escaped
redemptioner
for
he
wore
jauntily
a
swanskin
hat
and
stained
breeches
of
a
fine
cloth
he
was
a
bold
vain
fellow
my
beauty
says
he
as
we
sat
at
supper
silver
and
wedgwood
better
become
you
than
pewter
and
a
and
i
reckon
a
rope
would
sit
better
on
your
neck
than
a
ruff
retorted
polly
ann
while
the
company
shouted
with
laughter
but
he
was
not
the
kind
to
become
discomfited
i
d
give
a
guinea
to
see
you
in
silk
but
i
vow
your
hair
looks
better
as
it
not
so
yours
said
she
like
lightning
twould
look
better
to
me
hanging
on
the
belt
of
one
of
them
red
in
the
morning
when
he
would
have
lifted
the
pack
of
alum
salt
polly
ann
gave
him
a
push
that
sent
him
sprawling
but
she
did
it
in
such
good
nature
withal
that
the
fellow
mistook
her
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
flung
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
kissed
her
whereupon
i
hit
him
with
a
sapling
and
he
staggered
and
let
her
go
you
imp
of
hell
he
cried
rubbing
the
bump
he
made
a
vicious
dash
at
me
that
boded
no
good
but
i
slipped
behind
the
hominy
block
and
polly
ann
who
was
like
a
panther
on
her
feet
dashed
at
him
and
gave
him
a
buffet
in
the
cheek
that
sent
him
reeling
again
after
that
we
were
more
devoted
friends
than
ever
we
travelled
slowly
day
by
day
until
i
saw
the
mountains
lift
blue
against
the
western
sky
and
the
sight
of
them
was
like
home
once
more
i
loved
them
and
though
i
thought
with
sadness
of
my
father
i
was
on
the
whole
happier
with
polly
ann
than
i
had
been
in
the
lonely
cabin
on
the
yadkin
her
spirits
flagged
a
little
as
she
drew
near
home
but
old
ripley
s
rose
there
s
burr
s
he
would
say
and
o
hara
s
and
williamson
s
marking
the
cabins
set
amongst
the
and
thar
sweeping
his
hand
at
a
blackened
heap
of
logs
lying
on
the
stones
thar
s
whar
nell
tyler
and
her
baby
was
poor
nell
said
polly
ann
the
tears
coming
into
her
eyes
as
she
turned
away
and
jim
tyler
was
killed
gittin
to
the
fort
he
can
t
say
i
didn
t
warn
i
reckon
he
ll
never
say
nuthin
now
said
polly
ann
it
was
in
truth
a
dismal
sight
the
shapeless
timbers
the
corn
planted
with
such
care
choked
with
weeds
and
the
poor
utensils
of
the
little
family
scattered
and
broken
before
the
these
same
indians
had
killed
my
father
and
there
surged
up
in
my
breast
that
hatred
of
the
painted
race
felt
by
every
backwoods
boy
in
my
time
towards
the
end
of
the
day
the
trace
led
into
a
beautiful
green
valley
and
in
the
middle
of
it
was
a
stream
shining
in
the
afternoon
sun
then
polly
ann
fell
entirely
silent
and
presently
as
the
shadows
grew
purple
we
came
to
a
cabin
set
under
some
spreading
trees
on
a
knoll
where
a
woman
sat
spinning
at
the
door
three
children
playing
at
her
feet
she
stared
at
us
so
earnestly
that
i
looked
at
polly
ann
and
saw
her
redden
and
pale
the
children
were
the
first
to
come
shouting
at
us
and
then
the
woman
dropped
her
wool
and
ran
down
the
slope
straight
into
polly
ann
s
arms
ripley
halted
the
horses
with
a
grunt
the
two
women
drew
off
and
looked
into
each
other
s
faces
then
polly
ann
dropped
her
eyes
have
ye
she
said
and
stopped
no
polly
ann
not
one
word
sence
tom
and
his
pa
went
what
do
folks
say
in
the
settlements
polly
ann
turned
up
her
nose
they
don
t
know
nuthin
in
the
settlements
she
replied
i
wrote
to
tom
and
told
him
you
was
gone
said
the
older
woman
i
knowed
he
d
wanter
and
she
looked
meaningly
at
polly
ann
who
said
nothing
the
children
had
been
pulling
at
the
girl
s
skirts
and
suddenly
she
made
a
dash
at
them
they
scattered
screaming
with
delight
and
she
after
them
howdy
ripley
said
the
woman
smiling
a
little
howdy
mis
mcchesney
said
the
old
man
shortly
so
this
was
the
mother
of
tom
of
whom
i
had
heard
so
much
she
was
in
truth
a
person
her
fleshy
face
creased
with
strong
character
who
hev
ye
brought
with
ye
she
asked
glancing
at
me
a
lad
polly
ann
took
a
shine
to
in
the
settlements
said
the
old
man
polly
ann
polly
ann
he
cried
sharply
we
ll
hev
to
be
gittin
and
then
as
though
an
afterthought
which
it
really
was
not
he
added
how
be
ye
for
salt
mis
mcchesney
said
she
wal
i
reckon
a
little
might
come
handy
said
he
and
to
the
girl
who
stood
panting
beside
him
polly
give
mis
mcchesney
some
polly
ann
did
and
generously
the
salt
they
had
carried
with
so
much
labor
threescore
and
ten
miles
from
the
settlements
then
we
took
our
departure
the
girl
turning
for
one
last
look
at
tom
s
mother
and
at
the
cabin
where
he
had
dwelt
we
were
all
silent
the
rest
of
the
way
climbing
the
slender
trail
through
the
forest
over
the
gap
into
the
next
valley
for
i
was
jealous
of
tom
i
am
not
ashamed
to
own
it
now
in
the
smoky
haze
that
rises
just
before
night
lets
her
curtain
fall
we
descended
the
farther
slope
and
came
to
ripley
s
cabin
chapter
vii
in
sight
of
the
blue
wall
once
more
polly
ann
lived
alone
with
her
grandfather
her
father
and
mother
having
been
killed
by
indians
some
years
before
there
was
that
bond
between
us
had
we
needed
one
her
father
had
built
the
cabin
a
large
one
with
a
loft
and
a
ladder
climbing
to
it
and
a
sleeping
room
and
a
kitchen
the
cabin
stood
on
a
terrace
that
nature
had
levelled
looking
across
a
swift
and
shallow
stream
towards
the
mountains
there
was
the
truck
patch
with
its
yellow
squashes
and
melons
and
cabbages
and
beans
where
polly
ann
and
i
worked
through
the
hot
mornings
and
the
corn
patch
with
the
great
stumps
of
the
primeval
trees
standing
in
it
all
around
us
the
silent
forest
threw
its
encircling
arms
spreading
up
the
slopes
higher
and
higher
to
crown
the
crests
with
the
little
pines
and
hemlocks
and
balsam
fir
there
had
been
no
meat
save
bacon
since
the
mcchesneys
had
left
for
of
late
game
had
become
scarce
and
old
ripley
was
too
feeble
to
go
on
the
long
hunts
so
one
day
when
polly
ann
was
gone
across
the
ridge
i
took
down
the
long
rifle
from
the
buckhorns
over
the
hearth
and
the
hunting
knife
and
and
pouch
beside
it
and
trudged
up
the
slope
to
a
game
trail
i
discovered
all
day
i
waited
until
the
forest
light
grew
gray
when
a
buck
came
and
stood
over
the
water
raising
his
head
and
stamping
from
time
to
time
i
took
aim
in
the
notch
of
a
sapling
brought
him
down
cleaned
and
skinned
and
dragged
him
into
the
water
and
triumphantly
hauled
one
of
his
hams
down
the
trail
polly
ann
gave
a
cry
of
joy
when
she
saw
me
davy
she
exclaimed
little
davy
i
reckoned
you
was
gone
away
from
us
gran
pa
here
is
davy
back
and
he
has
shot
a
you
don
t
say
replied
ripley
surveying
me
and
my
booty
with
a
grim
smile
how
could
you
gran
pa
said
polly
ann
reproachfully
wal
said
ripley
the
gun
was
gone
an
davy
i
reckon
he
ain
t
sich
a
little
rascal
after
polly
ann
and
i
went
up
the
next
day
and
brought
the
rest
of
the
buck
merrily
homeward
after
that
i
became
the
hunter
of
the
family
but
oftener
than
not
i
returned
tired
and
and
ravenously
hungry
indeed
our
chief
game
was
rattlesnakes
which
we
killed
by
the
dozens
in
the
corn
and
truck
patches
as
polly
ann
and
i
went
about
our
daily
chores
we
would
talk
of
tom
mcchesney
often
she
would
sit
idle
at
the
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
i
would
have
given
kingdoms
for
one
ever
memorable
morning
early
in
the
crisp
autumn
a
grizzled
man
strode
up
the
trail
and
polly
ann
dropped
the
ear
of
corn
she
was
husking
and
stood
still
her
bosom
heaving
it
was
mcchesney
tom
s
father
alone
no
polly
ann
he
cried
there
ain
t
nuthin
happened
we
ve
laid
out
the
hill
towns
but
the
virginny
men
wanted
a
guide
and
tom
volunteered
and
so
he
ain
t
come
back
with
rutherford
s
polly
ann
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
and
looked
him
in
the
face
be
you
tellin
the
truth
warner
mcchesney
she
said
in
a
hard
voice
as
god
hears
me
said
warner
mcchesney
solemnly
he
sent
ye
he
drew
from
the
bosom
of
his
hunting
shirt
a
soiled
piece
of
birch
bark
scrawled
over
with
rude
writing
polly
seized
it
and
flew
into
the
house
the
hickories
turned
a
flaunting
yellow
the
oaks
a
the
leaves
crackled
on
the
catawba
vines
and
still
tom
mcchesney
did
not
come
the
cherokees
were
homeless
and
houseless
and
subdued
their
hill
towns
burned
their
corn
destroyed
their
squaws
and
children
wanderers
one
by
one
the
men
of
the
grape
vine
settlement
returned
to
save
what
they
might
of
their
crops
and
plough
for
the
next
year
burrs
o
haras
williamsons
and
winns
yes
tom
had
gone
to
guide
the
virginia
boys
all
had
tales
to
tell
of
his
prowess
and
how
he
had
saved
rutherford
s
men
from
ambush
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
all
of
which
polly
ann
listened
with
conscious
pride
and
replied
with
sallies
i
reckon
i
don
t
care
if
he
never
comes
back
she
would
cry
if
he
likes
the
virginny
boys
more
than
me
there
be
others
here
i
fancy
more
than
whereupon
the
informant
if
he
were
not
bound
in
matrimony
would
begin
to
make
eyes
at
polly
ann
or
if
he
were
bolder
and
went
at
the
wooing
in
the
more
demonstrative
fashion
of
the
backwoods
polly
ann
had
a
way
of
hitting
him
behind
the
ear
with
most
surprising
effect
one
windy
morning
when
the
leaves
were
kiting
over
the
valley
we
were
getting
ready
for
pounding
hominy
when
a
figure
appeared
on
the
trail
steadying
the
hood
of
her
sunbonnet
with
her
hand
the
girl
gazed
long
and
earnestly
and
a
lump
came
into
my
throat
at
the
thought
that
the
comer
might
be
tom
mcchesney
polly
ann
sat
down
at
the
block
again
in
disgust
it
s
only
chauncey
dike
she
said
who
s
chauncey
dike
i
asked
he
reckons
he
s
a
buck
was
all
that
polly
ann
vouchsafed
chauncey
drew
near
with
a
strut
he
had
very
long
black
hair
a
new
coonskin
cap
with
a
long
tassel
and
a
new
hunting
shirt
what
first
caught
my
eye
was
a
couple
of
withered
indian
scalps
that
hung
by
their
long
locks
from
his
girdle
chauncey
dike
was
certainly
handsome
wal
polly
ann
are
ye
tired
of
hanging
out
fer
tom
he
cried
when
a
dozen
paces
away
i
wouldn
t
be
if
you
was
the
only
one
left
ter
choose
polly
ann
retorted
chauncey
dike
stopped
in
his
tracks
and
with
laughter
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
not
very
much
pleased
wal
said
he
i
low
ye
won
t
see
tom
very
soon
he
s
gone
to
has
he
said
polly
ann
with
brave
indifference
he
met
a
gal
on
the
trail
a
blazin
fine
gal
said
chauncey
dike
she
was
goin
to
kaintuckee
and
tom
he
lowed
he
d
go
polly
ann
laughed
and
fingered
the
withered
pieces
of
skin
at
chauncey
s
girdle
did
tom
give
you
them
sculps
she
asked
innocently
chauncey
drew
up
stiffly
who
tom
mcchesney
i
reckon
he
ain
t
got
none
to
give
this
here
s
from
a
big
brave
at
noewee
whar
the
virginny
boys
was
and
he
held
up
the
one
with
the
longest
tuft
he
d
liked
to
tomahawked
me
out
n
the
briers
but
i
throwed
him
shucks
said
polly
ann
pounding
the
corn
i
reckon
you
found
him
but
that
night
as
we
sat
before
the
fading
red
of
the
backlog
the
old
man
dozing
in
his
chair
polly
ann
put
her
hand
on
mine
davy
she
said
softly
do
you
reckon
he
s
gone
to
kaintuckee
how
could
i
tell
the
days
passed
the
wind
grew
colder
and
one
subdued
dawn
we
awoke
to
find
that
the
pines
had
fantastic
white
arms
and
the
stream
ran
black
between
white
banks
all
that
day
and
for
many
days
after
the
snow
added
silently
to
the
thickness
of
its
blanket
and
winter
was
upon
us
it
was
a
long
winter
and
a
rare
one
polly
ann
sat
by
the
little
window
of
the
cabin
spinning
the
flax
into
and
she
made
a
hunting
shirt
for
her
grandfather
and
another
little
one
for
me
which
she
fitted
with
careful
fingers
but
as
she
spun
her
wheel
made
the
only
music
for
polly
ann
sang
no
more
once
i
came
on
her
as
she
was
thrusting
the
tattered
piece
of
birch
bark
into
her
gown
but
she
never
spoke
to
me
more
of
tom
mcchesney
when
from
time
to
time
the
snow
melted
on
the
hillsides
i
sometimes
surprised
a
deer
there
and
shot
him
with
the
heavy
rifle
and
so
the
months
wore
on
till
spring
the
buds
reddened
and
popped
and
the
briers
grew
pink
and
white
through
the
lengthening
days
we
toiled
in
the
truck
patch
but
always
as
i
bent
to
my
work
polly
ann
s
face
saddened
me
it
had
once
been
so
bright
and
it
should
have
been
so
at
this
season
old
ripley
grew
querulous
and
savage
and
hard
to
please
in
the
evening
when
my
work
was
done
i
often
lay
on
the
banks
of
the
stream
staring
at
the
high
ridge
its
ragged
edges
the
setting
sun
burned
a
molten
gold
and
the
thought
grew
on
me
that
i
might
make
my
way
over
the
mountains
into
that
land
beyond
and
find
tom
for
polly
ann
i
even
climbed
the
watershed
to
the
east
as
far
as
the
o
hara
farm
to
sound
that
big
irishman
about
the
trail
for
he
had
once
gone
to
kentucky
to
come
back
with
his
scalp
and
little
besides
o
hara
with
his
brogue
gave
me
such
a
terrifying
notion
of
the
horrors
of
the
wilderness
trail
that
i
threw
up
all
thought
of
following
it
alone
and
so
i
resolved
to
wait
until
i
heard
of
some
settlers
going
over
it
but
none
went
from
the
grape
vine
settlement
that
spring
war
was
in
kentucky
the
great
indian
nations
were
making
a
frantic
effort
to
drive
from
their
hunting
grounds
the
little
bands
of
settlers
there
and
these
were
in
sore
straits
so
i
waited
and
gave
polly
ann
no
hint
of
my
intention
sometimes
she
herself
would
slip
away
across
the
notch
to
see
mcchesney
and
the
children
she
never
took
me
with
her
on
these
journeys
but
nearly
always
when
she
came
back
at
nightfall
her
eyes
would
be
red
and
i
knew
the
two
women
had
been
weeping
together
there
came
a
certain
hot
sunday
in
july
when
she
went
on
this
errand
and
grandpa
ripley
having
gone
to
spend
the
day
at
old
man
winn
s
i
was
left
alone
i
remember
i
sat
on
the
squared
log
of
the
wondering
whether
if
i
were
to
make
my
way
to
salisbury
i
could
fall
in
with
a
party
going
across
the
mountains
into
kentucky
and
wondering
likewise
what
polly
ann
would
do
without
me
i
was
cleaning
the
long
rifle
a
labor
i
loved
when
suddenly
i
looked
up
startled
to
see
a
man
standing
in
front
of
me
how
he
got
there
i
know
not
i
stared
at
him
he
was
a
young
man
very
spare
and
very
burned
with
bright
red
hair
and
blue
eyes
that
had
a
kind
of
laughter
in
them
and
yet
were
sober
his
buckskin
hunting
shirt
was
old
and
stained
and
frayed
by
the
briers
and
his
leggins
and
moccasins
were
wet
from
fording
the
stream
he
leaned
his
chin
on
the
muzzle
of
his
gun
folks
live
here
sonny
said
he
i
nodded
whar
be
they
out
said
i
comin
back
he
asked
said
i
and
began
to
rub
the
lock
be
they
good
folks
said
he
yes
i
answered
wal
said
he
making
a
move
to
pass
me
i
reckon
i
ll
slip
in
and
take
what
i
ve
a
mind
to
and
move
now
i
liked
the
man
s
looks
very
much
but
i
did
not
know
what
he
would
do
so
i
got
in
his
way
and
clutched
the
gun
it
was
loaded
but
not
primed
and
i
emptied
a
little
powder
from
the
flask
in
the
pan
at
that
he
grinned
you
re
a
good
boy
sonny
he
said
do
you
reckon
you
could
hit
me
if
you
shot
yes
i
said
but
i
knew
i
could
scarcely
hold
the
gun
out
straight
without
a
rest
and
do
you
reckon
i
could
hit
you
fust
he
asked
at
that
i
laughed
and
he
laughed
what
s
your
name
i
told
him
who
do
you
love
best
in
all
the
world
said
he
it
was
a
queer
question
but
i
told
him
polly
ann
ripley
oh
said
he
after
a
pause
and
what
s
she
like
she
s
beautiful
i
said
she
s
been
very
kind
to
me
she
took
me
home
with
her
from
the
settlements
when
i
had
no
place
to
go
she
s
and
a
sharp
tongue
i
reckon
said
he
when
people
need
it
i
answered
oh
said
he
and
presently
she
s
very
merry
i
ll
she
used
to
be
but
that
s
gone
by
i
said
gone
by
said
he
his
voice
falling
is
she
sick
no
said
i
she
s
not
sick
she
s
sad
said
he
it
was
then
i
noticed
that
he
had
a
cut
across
his
temple
red
and
barely
healed
do
you
reckon
your
polly
ann
would
give
me
a
little
mite
to
eat
this
time
i
jumped
up
ran
into
the
house
and
got
down
some
and
a
leg
of
turkey
for
that
was
the
rule
of
the
border
he
took
them
in
great
bites
but
slowly
and
he
picked
the
bones
clean
i
had
breakfast
yesterday
morning
said
he
about
forty
mile
from
and
nothing
since
said
i
in
astonishment
fresh
air
and
water
and
exercise
said
he
and
sat
down
on
the
grass
he
was
silent
for
a
long
while
and
so
was
i
for
a
notion
had
struck
me
though
i
hardly
dared
to
give
it
voice
are
you
going
away
i
asked
at
last
he
laughed
why
said
he
if
you
were
going
to
kaintuckee
i
began
and
faltered
for
he
stared
at
me
very
hard
kaintuckee
he
said
there
s
a
country
but
it
s
full
of
blood
and
injun
varmints
now
would
you
leave
polly
ann
and
go
to
kaintuckee
are
you
going
i
said
i
reckon
i
am
he
said
as
soon
as
i
will
you
take
me
i
asked
breathless
i
i
won
t
be
in
your
way
and
i
can
walk
and
shoot
at
that
he
bent
back
his
head
and
laughed
which
made
me
redden
with
anger
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
more
soberly
you
re
a
queer
little
piece
said
he
why
do
you
want
to
go
thar
i
want
to
find
tom
mcchesney
for
polly
ann
i
said
he
turned
away
his
face
a
scamp
said
he
i
have
long
thought
so
i
said
he
laughed
again
it
was
a
laugh
that
made
me
want
to
join
him
had
i
not
been
irritated
and
he
s
a
scamp
you
say
and
why
else
he
would
be
coming
back
to
polly
mayhap
he
couldn
t
said
the
stranger
chauncey
dike
said
he
went
off
with
another
girl
into
and
what
did
polly
ann
say
to
that
the
stranger
demanded
she
asked
chauncey
if
tom
mcchesney
gave
him
the
scalps
he
had
on
his
at
that
he
laughed
in
good
earnest
and
slapped
his
repeatedly
all
at
once
he
stopped
and
stared
up
the
ridge
is
that
polly
ann
said
he
i
looked
and
far
up
the
trail
was
a
speck
i
reckon
it
is
i
answered
and
wondered
at
his
eyesight
she
travels
over
to
see
tom
mcchesney
s
ma
once
in
a
he
looked
at
me
queerly
i
reckon
i
ll
go
here
and
sit
down
davy
said
he
so
s
not
to
be
in
the
and
he
walked
around
the
corner
of
the
house
polly
ann
sauntered
down
the
trail
slowly
as
was
her
wont
after
such
an
occasion
and
the
man
behind
the
house
twice
whispered
with
extreme
caution
how
near
is
she
before
she
came
up
the
path
have
you
been
lonesome
davy
she
said
no
said
i
i
ve
had
a
it
s
not
chauncey
dike
again
she
said
he

t
dare
show
his
face
no

t
chauncey
this
man
would
like
to
have
seen
you

ann

here
i
braced
myself

tom
mcchesney
he
called
him
a

he
said
polly
ann
very
low
i
reckon
it
was
good
for
him

wasn
t

at

monkey

polly
ann

reckon

a
polly
ann
i
said
did
i
ever
do
anything
but
good
to
you
she
made
a
dive
at
me
and
before
i
could
escape
caught
me
in
her
strong
young
arms
and
hugged
me
you
re
the
best
friend
i
have
little
davy
she
cried
i
reckon
that
s
so
said
the
stranger
who
had
risen
and
was
standing
at
the
corner
polly
ann
looked
at
him
like
a
frightened
doe
and
as
she
stared
uncertain
whether
to
stay
or
fly
the
color
surged
into
her
cheeks
and
mounted
to
her
fair
forehead
tom
she
faltered
i
ve
come
back
polly
ann
said
he
but
his
voice
was
not
so
clear
as
a
while
ago
then
polly
ann
surprised
me
what
made
you
come
back
said
she
as
though
she
didn
t
care
a
minkskin
whereat
mcchesney
shifted
his
feet
i
reckon
it
was
to
fetch
you
polly
i
like
that
cried
she
he
s
come
to
fetch
me
that
was
the
first
time
in
months
her
laugh
had
sounded
natural
i
heerd
you
fetched
one
gal
acrost
the
mountains
and
now
you
want
to
fetch
polly
ann
says
he
there
was
a
time
when
you
knew
a
truthful
man
from
a
that
time
s
past
retorted
she
i
reckon
all
men
are
liars
what
are
ye
about
here
for
tom
mcchesney
when
yere
ma
s
breakin
her
heart
i
wonder

he
very
serious
i
ain
t
a
boaster
but
when
i
think
what
i
come
through
to
git
here
i
wonder
that
i
come
back
at
all
the
folks
shut
up
at
harrod
s
said
it
was
sure
death
ter
cross
the
mountains
now
i
ve
walked
two
hundred
miles
and
fed
seven
times
and
my
sculp
s
as
near
hangin
on
a
red
stick
s
belt
as
i
ever
want
it
to
tom
mcchesney
said
polly
ann
with
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
her
sunbonnet
tilted
that
s
the
longest
speech
you
ever
made
in
your
i
declare
i
lost
my
temper
with
polly
ann
then
nor
did
i
blame
tom
mcchesney
for
turning
on
his
heel
and
walking
away
but
he
had
gone
no
distance
at
all
before
polly
ann
with
three
springs
was
at
his
shoulder
tom
she
said
very
gently
he
hesitated
stopped
thumped
the
stock
of
his
gun
on
the
ground
and
wheeled
he
looked
at
her
doubtingly
and
her
eyes
fell
to
the
ground
tom
mcchesney
said
she
you
re
a
born
fool
with
thank
god
for
that
said
he
his
eyes
devouring
her
ay
said
she
and
then
you
want
me
to
go
to
kaintuckee
with
you
that
s
what
i
come
for
he
stammered
his
assurance
all
run
away
again
i
ll
go
she
answered
so
gently
that
her
words
were
all
but
blown
away
by
the
summer
wind
he
laid
his
rifle
against
a
stump
at
the
edge
of
the
but
she
bounded
clear
of
him
then
she
stood
panting
her
eyes
sparkling
i
ll
go
she
said
raising
her
finger
i
ll
go
for
one
what
s
that
he
demanded
that
you
ll
take
davy
along
with
this
time
tom
had
her
struggling
like
a
wild
thing
in
his
arms
and
kissing
her
black
hair
madly
as
for
me
i
might
have
been
in
the
next
settlement
for
all
they
cared
and
then
polly
ann
as
red
as
a
holly
berry
broke
away
from
him
and
ran
to
me
caught
me
up
and
hid
her
face
in
my
shoulder
tom
mcchesney
stood
looking
at
us
grinning
and
that
day
i
ceased
to
hate
him
there
s
no
devil
ef
i
don
t
take
him
polly
ann
said
he
why
he
was
to
kaintuckee
ter
find
me
for
what
said
she
raising
her
head
that
s
what
he
told
me
afore
he
knew
who
i
was
he
wanted
to
know
ef
i
d
fetch
him
little
davy
cried
polly
ann
the
last
i
saw
of
them
that
day
they
were
going
off
up
the
trace
towards
his
mother
s
polly
ann
keeping
ahead
of
him
and
just
out
of
his
reach
and
i
was
very
very
happy
for
tom
mcchesney
had
come
back
at
last
and
polly
ann
was
herself
once
more
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
polly
ann
s
wedding
she
was
all
for
delay
and
such
a
bunch
of
coquetry
as
i
have
never
seen
she
raised
one
objection
after
another
but
tom
was
a
firm
man
and
his
late
experiences
in
the
wilderness
had
made
him
impatient
of
trifling
he
had
promised
the
kentucky
settlers
fighting
for
their
lives
in
their
blockhouses
that
he
would
come
back
again
and
a
resolute
man
who
was
a
good
shot
was
sorely
missed
in
the
country
in
those
days
it
was
not
the
thousand
dangers
and
hardships
of
the
journey
across
the
wilderness
trail
that
frightened
polly
ann
not
she
nor
would
she
listen
to
tom
when
he
implored
her
to
let
him
return
alone
to
come
back
for
her
when
the
redskins
had
got
over
the
first
furies
of
their
hatred
as
for
me
the
thought
of
going
with
them
into
that
promised
land
was
like
wine
wondering
what
the
place
was
like
i
could
not
sleep
of
nights
ain
t
you
afeerd
to
go
davy
said
tom
to
me
you
promised
polly
ann
to
take
me
said
i
indignantly
davy
said
he
you
ain
t
over
handsome
twouldn
t
improve
yere
looks
to
be
bald
they
hev
a
way
of
takin
yere
ha
r
better
stay
behind
with
gran
pa
ripley
till
i
kin
fetch
ye
tom
said
polly
ann
you
kin
just
go
back
alone
if
you
don
t
take
so
one
of
the
winn
boys
agreed
to
come
over
to
stay
with
old
ripley
until
quieter
times
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
went
on
apace
that
week
i
had
not
thought
that
the
grape
vine
settlement
held
so
many
people
and
they
came
from
other
settlements
too
for
news
spread
quickly
in
that
country
despite
the
distances
tom
mcchesney
was
plainly
a
favorite
with
the
men
who
had
marched
with
rutherford
all
the
week
they
came
loaded
with
offerings
turkeys
and
venison
and
pork
and
bear
meat
greatest
delicacy
of
all
until
the
cool
spring
was
filled
for
the
feast
from
thirty
miles
down
the
broad
a
gaunt
baptist
preacher
on
a
fat
white
pony
arrived
the
night
before
he
had
been
sent
for
to
tie
the
knot
polly
ann
s
dawned
bright
and
fair
and
long
before
the
sun
glistened
on
the
corn
tassels
we
were
up
and
clearing
out
the
big
room
the
fiddlers
came
first
a
merry
lot
and
then
the
guests
from
afar
began
to
arrive
some
of
them
had
travelled
half
the
night
the
bridegroom
s
friends
were
assembling
at
the
mcchesney
place
at
last
when
the
sun
was
over
the
stream
rose
such
indian
and
shots
from
the
ridge
trail
as
made
me
think
the
redskins
were
upon
us
the
shouts
and
hurrahs
grew
louder
and
louder
the
quickening
thud
of
horses
hoofs
was
heard
in
the
woods
and
there
burst
into
sight
of
the
assembly
by
the
truck
patch
two
wild
figures
on
crazed
horses
charging
down
the
path
towards
the
house
we
scattered
to
right
and
left
on
they
came
leaping
logs
and
brush
and
ditches
until
one
of
them
pulled
up
yelling
madly
at
the
very
door
the
sides
of
his
horse
moving
with
quick
heaves
it
was
chauncey
dike
and
he
had
won
the
race
for
the
bottle
of
black
betty
chauncey
dike
his
long
black
hair
shining
with
bear
s
oil
amid
the
cheers
of
the
bride
s
friends
he
leaped
from
his
saddle
mounted
a
stump
and
flapping
his
arms
crowed
in
victory
before
he
had
done
the
vanguard
of
the
groom
s
friends
were
upon
us
all
in
the
finest
of
backwoods
regalia
new
hunting
shirts
trimmed
with
bits
of
color
and
all
armed
to
the
teeth
scalping
knife
tomahawk
and
all
nor
had
chauncey
dike
forgotten
the
scalp
of
the
brave
who
leaped
at
him
out
of
the
briers
at
neowee
polly
ann
was
radiant
in
a
white
linen
gown
woven
and
sewed
by
her
own
hands
it
was
not
such
a
gown
as
temple
nick
s
mother
would
have
worn
and
yet
she
was
to
me
an
hundred
times
more
beautiful
than
that
lady
in
all
her
silks
peeping
out
from
under
it
were
the
little
moccasins
which
tom
himself
had
brought
across
the
mountains
in
the
bosom
of
his
hunting
shirt
polly
ann
was
radiant
and
yet
at
times
so
rapturously
shy
that
when
the
preacher
announced
himself
ready
to
tie
the
knot
she
ran
into
the
house
and
hid
in
the
cupboard
for
polly
ann
was
a
child
of
nature
thence
coloring
like
a
wild
rose
she
was
dragged
by
a
boisterous
bevy
of
girls
in
to
the
spreading
maple
of
the
forest
that
stood
on
the
high
bank
over
the
stream
the
assembly
fell
solemn
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
save
the
breathing
of
nature
in
the
heyday
of
her
time
and
though
i
was
happy
the
sobs
rose
in
my
throat
there
stood
polly
ann
as
white
now
as
the
bleached
linen
she
wore
and
tom
mcchesney
tall
and
spare
and
broad
as
strong
a
figure
of
a
man
as
ever
i
laid
eyes
on
god
had
truly
made
that
couple
for
wedlock
in
his
leafy
temple
the
words
of
the
preacher
in
prayer
broke
the
stillness
they
were
made
man
and
wife
and
then
began
a
day
of
merriment
of
unrestraint
such
as
the
backwoods
alone
knows
the
feast
was
spread
out
in
the
long
grass
under
the
trees
sides
of
venison
bear
meat
fresh
baked
by
mcchesney
and
polly
ann
herself
and
all
the
vegetables
in
the
patch
there
was
no
stint
either
of
maple
beer
and
rum
and
black
betty
and
toasts
to
the
bride
and
groom
amidst
gusts
of
laughter
that
they
might
populate
and
polly
ann
would
have
it
that
i
should
sit
by
her
side
under
the
maple
the
fiddlers
played
and
there
were
foot
races
and
shooting
matches
ay
and
wrestling
matches
in
the
severe
manner
of
the
backwoods
between
the
young
bucks
more
than
one
of
which
might
have
ended
seriously
were
it
not
for
the
high
humor
of
the
crowd
tom
mcchesney
himself
was
in
most
of
them
a
hot
favorite
by
a
trick
he
had
learned
in
the
indian
country
he
threw
chauncey
dike
no
mean
adversary
so
hard
that
the
backwoods
dandy
lay
for
a
moment
in
sleep
contrary
to
the
custom
of
many
tom
was
not
in
the
habit
of
crowing
on
such
occasions
nor
did
he
even
smile
as
he
helped
chauncey
to
his
feet
but
polly
ann
knew
and
i
knew
that
he
was
thinking
of
what
chauncey
had
said
to
her
so
the
long
summer
afternoon
wore
away
into
twilight
and
the
sun
fell
behind
the
blue
ridges
we
were
to
cross
pine
knots
were
lighted
in
the
big
room
the
fiddlers
set
to
again
and
then
came
jigs
and
three
and
four
handed
reels
that
made
the
puncheons
rattle
and
and
polly
ann
was
the
leader
now
the
young
men
flinging
the
girls
from
fireplace
to
window
in
the
reels
and
back
again
and
when
panting
and
perspiring
the
lass
was
too
tired
to
stand
longer
she
dropped
into
the
hospitable
lap
of
the
nearest
buck
who
was
perched
on
the
bench
along
the
wall
awaiting
his
chance
for
so
it
went
in
the
backwoods
in
those
days
and
long
after
and
no
harm
in
it
that
ever
i
could
see
well
suddenly
as
if
by
concert
the
music
stopped
and
a
shout
of
laughter
rang
under
the
beams
as
polly
ann
flew
out
of
the
door
with
the
girls
after
her
as
swift
of
foot
as
she
they
dragged
her
a
struggling
captive
to
the
which
made
the
other
end
of
the
house
and
when
they
emerged
blushing
and
giggling
and
subdued
the
fun
began
with
tom
mcchesney
he
gave
the
young
men
a
pretty
fight
indeed
and
long
before
they
had
him
conquered
the
elder
guests
had
made
their
escape
through
door
and
window
all
night
the
reels
and
jigs
went
on
and
the
feasting
and
drinking
too
in
the
fine
rain
that
came
at
dawn
to
hide
the
crests
the
company
rode
wearily
homeward

the

some
to
endure
and
many
to
quail
some
to
conquer
and
many
to
fail
toiling
over
the
wilderness

as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
the
morning
we
started
on
our
journey
across
the
blue
wall
before
the
sun
chased
away
the
filmy
veil
of
mist
from
the
brooks
in
the
valley
the
mcchesneys
father
mother
and
children
were
gathered
to
see
us
depart
and
as
they
helped
us
to
tighten
the
packsaddles
tom
himself
had
made
from
chosen
they
did
not
cease
lamenting
that
we
were
going
to
certain
death
our
scrawny
horses
splashed
across
the
stream
and
we
turned
to
see
a
gaunt
and
lonely
figure
standing
apart
against
the
sun
stern
and
sorrowful
we
waved
our
hands
and
set
our
faces
towards
kaintuckee
tom
walked
ahead
rifle
on
shoulder
then
polly
ann
and
lastly
i
drove
the
two
shaggy
ponies
the
instruments
of
husbandry
we
had
been
able
to
gather
awry
on
their
packs
a
scythe
a
spade
and
a
hoe
i
triumphantly
carried
the
axe
it
was
not
long
before
we
were
in
the
wilderness
shut
in
by
mountain
crags
and
presently
polly
ann
forgot
her
sorrows
in
the
perils
of
the
trace
choked
by
briers
and
grapevines
blocked
by
sliding
stones
and
earth
it
rose
and
rose
through
the
heat
and
burden
of
the
day
until
it
lost
itself
in
the
open
heights
as
the
sun
was
wearing
down
to
the
western
ridges
the
mischievous
sorrel
mare
turned
her
pack
on
a
sapling
and
one
of
the
precious
bags
burst
in
an
instant
we
were
on
our
knees
gathering
the
golden
meal
in
our
hands
polly
ann
baked
journeycakes
on
a
hot
stone
from
what
we
saved
under
the
shiny
ivy
leaves
and
scarce
had
i
spancelled
the
horses
ere
tom
returned
with
a
fat
turkey
he
had
shot
was
there
ever
sech
a
wedding
journey
said
polly
ann
as
we
sat
about
the
fire
for
the
mountain
air
was
chill
and
tom
and
davy
as
grave
as
parsons
ye
d
guess
one
of
you
was
rutherford
himself
and
the
other
no
wonder
he
was
grave
i
little
realized
then
the
task
he
had
set
himself
to
pilot
a
woman
and
a
lad
into
a
country
haunted
by
frenzied
savages
when
single
men
feared
to
go
this
season
but
now
he
smiled
and
patted
polly
ann
s
brown
hand
it
s
one
of
yer
own
choosing
lass
said
he
of
my
own
choosing
cried
she
come
davy
we
ll
go
back
to
tom
grinned
i
reckon
the
redskins
won
t
bother
us
till
we
git
by
the
nollichucky
and
watauga
settlements
he
said
the
redskins
said
polly
ann
indignant
i
reckon
if
one
of
em
did
git
me
he
d
kiss
me
once
in
a
whereupon
tom
looking
more
sheepish
still
tried
to
kiss
her
and
failed
ignominiously
for
she
vanished
into
the
dark
woods
if
a
redskin
got
you
here
said
tom
when
she
had
slipped
back
he
d
fetch
you
to
what
s
that
she
demanded
where
all
the
red
and
white
and
yellow
scalawags
over
the
mountains
is
gathered
he
answered
and
he
told
of
a
deep
gorge
between
towering
mountains
where
a
great
river
cried
angrily
of
a
black
cave
out
of
which
a
black
stream
ran
where
a
man
could
paddle
a
dugout
for
miles
into
the
rock
the
river
was
the
tennessee
and
the
place
the
resort
of
the
chickamauga
bandits
pirates
of
the
mountains
outcasts
of
all
nations
and
dragging
canoe
was
their
chief
it
was
on
the
whole
a
merry
journey
the
first
part
of
it
if
a
rough
one
often
polly
ann
would
draw
me
to
her
and
whisper
we
ll
hold
out
davy
he
ll
never
when
the
truth
was
that
the
big
fellow
was
going
at
half
his
pace
on
our
account
he
told
us
there
was
no
fear
of
redskins
here
yet
when
the
scream
of
a
painter
or
the
hoot
of
an
owl
stirred
me
from
my
exhausted
slumber
i
caught
sight
of
him
with
his
back
to
a
tree
staring
into
the
forest
his
rifle
at
his
side
the
day
was
dawning
turn
about
s
fair
i
expostulated
ye
ll
need
yere
sleep
davy
said
he
or
ye
ll
never
grow
any
i
thought
kaintuckee
was
to
the
west
i
said
and
you
re
making
for
i
had
observed
him
day
after
day
we
had
left
the
trails
sometimes
he
climbed
tree
and
again
he
sent
me
to
the
upper
branches
whence
i
surveyed
a
sea
of
waving
in
the
wind
and
looked
onward
to
where
a
green
velvet
hollow
lay
nestling
on
the
western
side
of
a
ridge
north
said
tom
to
polly
ann
laughing
the
little
devil
will
beat
me
at
woodcraft
soon
ay
north
davy
i
m
hunting
for
the
nollichucky
trace
that
leads
to
the
watauga
it
was
wonderful
to
me
how
he
chose
his
way
through
the
mountains
once
in
a
while
we
caught
sight
of
a
yellow
blaze
in
a
tree
made
by
himself
scarce
a
month
gone
when
he
came
southward
alone
to
fetch
polly
ann
again
the
tired
roan
shied
back
from
the
bleached
bones
of
a
traveller
picked
clean
by
wolves
at
sundown
when
we
loosed
our
exhausted
horses
to
graze
on
the
wet
grass
by
the
streams
tom
would
go
off
to
look
for
a
deer
or
turkey
and
often
not
come
back
to
us
until
long
after
darkness
had
fallen
davy
ll
take
care
of
you
polly
ann
he
would
say
as
he
left
us
and
she
would
smile
at
him
bravely
and
say
i
reckon
i
kin
look
out
for
davy
awhile
but
when
he
was
gone
and
the
crooning
stillness
set
in
broken
only
by
the
many
sounds
of
the
night
we
would
sit
huddled
together
by
the
fire
it
was
dread
for
him
she
felt
not
for
herself
and
in
both
our
minds
rose
red
images
of
hideous
foes
skulking
behind
his
brave
form
as
he
trod
the
forest
floor
polly
ann
was
not
the
woman
to
whimper
and
yet
i
have
but
dim
recollections
of
this
journey
it
was
no
hardship
to
a
lad
brought
up
in
woodcraft
fear
of
the
indians
like
a
dog
shivering
with
the
cold
was
a
deadened
pain
on
the
border
strangely
enough
it
was
i
who
chanced
upon
the
nollichucky
trace
which
follows
the
meanderings
of
that
river
northward
through
the
great
smoky
mountains
it
was
made
long
ago
by
the
southern
indians
as
they
threaded
their
way
to
the
hunting
lands
of
kaintuckee
and
shared
now
by
indian
traders
the
path
was
redolent
with
odors
and
bright
with
mountain
shrubs
and
flowers
the
pink
laurel
bush
the
shining
rhododendron
and
the
grape
and
plum
and
wild
crab
the
clear
notes
of
the
mountain
birds
were
in
our
ears
by
day
and
the
music
of
the
water
falling
over
the
ledges
mingled
with
that
of
the
leaves
rustling
in
the
wind
lulled
us
to
sleep
at
night
high
above
us
as
we
descended
the
gap
from
naked
crag
to
ridge
was
spanned
by
the
eagle
s
flight
and
virgin
valleys
where
future
generations
were
to
be
born
spread
out
and
narrowed
again
valleys
with
a
deep
carpet
of
cane
and
grass
where
the
deer
and
elk
and
bear
fed
unmolested
it
was
perchance
the
next
evening
that
my
eyes
fell
upon
a
sight
which
is
one
of
the
wonders
of
my
boyish
memories
the
trail
slipped
to
the
edge
of
a
precipice
and
at
our
feet
the
valley
widened
planted
amidst
giant
trees
on
a
shining
green
lawn
that
ran
down
to
the
racing
nollichucky
was
the
strangest
house
it
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
see
of
no
shape
of
huge
size
and
built
of
logs
one
wing
hitched
to
another
by
dog
alleys
as
we
called
them
and
from
its
wide
stone
chimneys
the
pearly
smoke
rose
upward
in
the
still
air
through
the
poplar
branches
beyond
it
a
setting
sun
gilded
the
and
horses
and
cattle
dotted
the
pastures
we
stood
for
a
while
staring
at
this
oasis
in
the
wilderness
and
to
my
boyish
fancy
it
was
a
fitting
introduction
to
a
delectable
land
glory
be
to
heaven
exclaimed
polly
ann
it
s
nollichucky
jack
s
house
said
tom
and
who
may
he
be
said
she
who
may
he
be
cried
tom
captain
john
sevier
king
of
the
border
and
i
reckon
the
best
man
to
sweep
out
redskins
in
the
watauga
do
you
know
him
said
she
i
was
chose
as
one
of
his
scouts
when
we
fired
the
cherokee
hill
towns
last
summer
said
tom
with
pride
thar
was
blood
and
thunder
for
ye
we
went
down
the
great
which
lies
below
us
and
when
we
was
through
there
wasn
t
a
or
a
wigwam
or
a
war
post
left
we
didn
t
harm
the
squaws
nor
the
children
but
there
warn
t
no
prisoners
took
when
nollichucky
jack
strikes
i
reckon
it
s
more
like
a
thunderbolt
nor
anything
do
you
think
he
s
at
home
tom
i
asked
fearful
that
i
should
not
see
this
celebrated
person
we
ll
soon
l
arn
said
he
as
we
descended
i
heerd
he
was
agoin
to
punish
them
chickamauga
robbers
by
just
then
we
heard
a
prodigious
barking
and
a
dozen
hounds
came
charging
down
the
path
at
our
horses
legs
the
roan
shying
into
the
truck
patch
a
man
s
voice
deep
clear
compelling
was
heard
calling
vi
flora
ripper
i
saw
him
coming
from
the
porch
of
the
house
a
tall
slim
figure
in
a
hunting
shirt
that
fitted
to
perfection
and
cavalry
boots
his
face
his
carriage
his
quick
movement
and
stride
filled
my
notion
of
a
hero
and
my
instinct
told
me
he
was
a
gentleman
born
why
bless
my
soul
it
s
tom
mcchesney
he
cried
ten
paces
away
while
tom
grinned
with
pleasure
at
the
recognition
but
what
have
you
here
a
wife
said
tom
standing
on
one
foot
captain
sevier
fixed
his
dark
blue
eyes
on
polly
ann
with
approbation
and
he
bowed
to
her
very
gracefully
where
are
you
going
ma
am
may
i
ask
he
said
to
kaintuckee
said
polly
ann
to
kaintuckee
cried
captain
sevier
turning
to
tom
egad
then
you
ve
no
right
to
a
wife
and
to
such
a
wife
and
he
glanced
again
at
polly
ann
why
mcchesney
you
never
struck
me
as
a
rash
man
have
you
lost
your
senses
to
take
a
woman
into
kentucky
this
year
so
the
forts
be
still
in
trouble
said
tom
trouble
cried
sevier
with
a
quick
fling
of
his
whip
at
an
unruly
hound

logan

at

s
they
don
t
dare

their
noses
outside
the
stockades
the
indians
have
swarmed
into
kentucky
like
red
ants
i
tell
you
ten
days
ago
when
i
was
in
the
holston
settlements
major
ben
logan
came
in
his
fort
had
been
shut
up
since
may
they
were
out
of
powder
and
lead
and
somebody
had
to
come
how
did
he
come
as
the
wolf
lopes
nay
as
the
crow
flies
over
crag
and
ford
cumberland
clinch
and
all
forty
miles
a
day
for
five
days
and
never
saw
a
trace
for
the
war
parties
were
watching
the
wilderness
and
he
swung
again
towards
polly
ann
you
ll
not
go
to
kaintuckee
ma
am
you
ll
stay
here
with
us
until
the
redskins
are
beaten
off
there
he
may
go
if
he
i
reckon
we
didn
t
come
this
far
to
give
out
captain
sevier
said
she
you
don
t
look
to
be
the
kind
to
give
out
mcchesney
said
he
and
yet
it
may
not
be
a
matter
of
giving
out
he
added
more
soberly
this
mixture
of
heartiness
and
gravity
seemed
to
sit
well
on
him
surely
you
have
been
enterprising
tom
where
in
the
name
of
the
continental
congress
did
you
get
the
lad
i
married
him
along
with
polly
ann
said
tom
that
was
the
bargain
and
i
reckon
he
was
worth
i
d
take
a
dozen
to
get
her
declared
sevier
while
polly
ann
blushed
well
well
supper
s
waiting
us
and
cider
and
applejack
for
we
don
t
get
a
wedding
party
every
day
some
gentlemen
are
here
whose
word
may
have
more
weight
and
whose
attractions
may
be
greater
than
he
whistled
to
a
negro
lad
who
took
our
horses
and
led
us
through
the
and
the
house
to
the
lawn
at
the
far
side
of
it
a
rude
table
was
set
there
under
a
great
tree
and
around
it
three
gentlemen
were
talking
my
memory
of
all
of
them
is
more
vivid
than
it
might
be
were
their
names
not
household
words
in
the
western
country
captain
sevier
startled
them
my
friends
said
he
if
you
have
despatches
for
kaintuckee
i
pray
you
get
them
ready
over
they
looked
up
at
him
one
sternly
the
other
two
gravely
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
sevier
said
the
stern
one
that
my
friend
tom
mcchesney
is
going
there
with
his
wife
unless
we
can
stop
him
said
sevier
stop
him
thundered
the
stern
gentleman
kicking
back
his
chair
and
straightening
up
to
what
seemed
to
me
a
colossal
height
i
stared
at
him
boylike
he
had
long
hair
and
a
creased
fleshy
face
and
sunken
eyes
he
looked
as
if
he
might
stop
anybody
as
he
turned
upon
tom
who
the
devil
is
this
tom
mcchesney
he
demanded
sevier
laughed
the
best
scout
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
said
he
a
deadly
man
with
a
deckard
an
unerring
man
at
choosing
a
wife
and
he
bowed
to
the
reddening
polly
ann
and
a
fool
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
tut
tut
said
the
iron
gentleman
who
was
the
famous
captain
evan
shelby
of
king
s
meadows
he
ll
leave
her
here
in
our
settlements
while
he
helps
us
fight
dragging
canoe
and
his
chickamauga
if
he
leaves
me
said
polly
ann
her
eyes
flashing
that
s
an
end
to
the
bargain
he
ll
never
find
me
captain
sevier
laughed
again
there
s
spirit
for
you
he
cried
slapping
his
whip
against
his
boot
at
this
another
gentleman
stood
up
a
younger
counterpart
of
the
first
only
he
towered
higher
and
his
shoulders
were
broader
he
had
a
face
and
pleasant
eyes
that
twinkled
now
sunken
in
with
fleshy
creases
at
the
corners
tom
mcchesney
said
he
don
t
mind
my
father
if
any
man
besides
logan
can
get
inside
the
forts
you
can
do
you
remember
me
i
reckon
i
do
isaac
shelby
said
tom
putting
a
big
hand
into
shelby
s
bigger
one
i
reckon
i
won
t
soon
forget
how
you
stepped
out
of
ranks
and
tuk

when
the
boys
was
runnin
and
turned
the
he
looked
like
the
man
to
step
out
of
ranks
and
take
command
pish
said
isaac
shelby
blushing
like
a
girl
where
would
i
have
been
if
you
and
moore
and
findley
and
the
rest
hadn
t
stood
em
off
till
we
turned
round
by
this
time
the
third
gentleman
had
drawn
my
attention
not
by
anything
he
said
for
he
remained
silent
sitting
with
his
dark
brown
head
bent
forward
quietly
gazing
at
the
scene
from
under
his
brows
the
instant
he
spoke
they
turned
towards
him
he
was
perhaps
forty
and
not
so
tall
as
sevier
why
do
you
go
to
kaintuckee
mcchesney
he
asked
i
give
my
word
to
harrod
and
clark
to
come
back
robertson
said
tom
and
the
wife
if
you
take
her
you
run
a
great
risk
of
losing
and
if
he
leaves
me
said
polly
ann
flinging
her
head
he
will
lose
me
the
others
laughed
but
robertson
merely
smiled
faith
cried
captain
sevier
if
those
i
met
coming
back
over
the
wilderness
trace
had
been
of
that
stripe
they
d
have
more
men
in
the
forts
with
that
the
captain
called
for
supper
to
be
served
where
we
sat
he
was
a
widower
with
lads
somewhere
near
my
own
age
and
i
recall
being
shown
about
the
place
by
them
and
later
when
the
fireflies
glowed
and
the
nollichucky
sang
in
the
darkness
we
listened
to
the
talk
of
the
war
of
the
year
gone
by
i
needed
not
to
be
told
that
before
me
were
the
renowned
leaders
of
the
watauga
settlements
my
hero
worship
cried
it
aloud
within
me
these
captains
dwelt
on
the
of
mystery
conquered
the
wilderness
and
drove
before
them
its
savage
tribes
by
their
might
when
they
spoke
of
the
cherokees
and
told
how
that
same
stuart
the
companion
of
cameron
was
urging
them
to
war
against
our
people
a
fierce
anger
blazed
within
me
for
the
cherokees
had
killed
my
father
i
remember
the
men
scarcely
what
they
said
evan
shelby
s
words
like
heavy
blows
on
an
anvil
isaac
shelby
s
none
the
less
forceful
james
robertson
compelling
his
listeners
by
some
strange
power
he
was
perchance
the
strongest
man
there
though
none
of
us
guessed
after
ruling
that
region
that
he
was
to
repeat
untold
hardships
to
found
and
rear
another
settlement
farther
west
but
best
i
loved
to
hear
captain
sevier
whose
talk
lacked
not
force
but
had
a
daring
a
humor
a
lightness
of
touch
that
seemed
more
in
keeping
with
that
world
i
had
left
behind
me
in
charlestown
him
i
loved
and
at
length
i
solved
the
puzzle
to
me
he
was
nick
temple
grown
to
manhood
i
slept
in
the
room
with
captain
sevier
s
boys
and
one
window
of
it
was
of
paper
smeared
with
bear
s
grease
through
which
the
sunlight
came
all
bleared
and
yellow
in
the
morning
i
had
a
boy
s
interest
in
affairs
and
i
remember
being
told
that
the
gentlemen
were
met
here
to
discuss
the
treaty
between
themselves
and
the
great
oconostota
chief
of
the
cherokees
and
also
to
consider
the
policy
of
punishing
once
for
all
dragging
canoe
and
his
bandits
at
chickamauga
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
under
the
trees
these
gentlemen
generously
dropped
their
own
business
to
counsel
tom
and
i
observed
with
pride
that
he
had
gained
their
regard
during
the
last
year
s
war
shelby
s
threats
and
robertson
s
warnings
and
sevier
s
exhortations
having
no
effect
upon
his
determination
to
proceed
to
kentucky
they
began
to
advise
him
how
to
go
and
he
sat
silent
while
they
talked
and
finally
when
they
asked
him
he
spoke
of
making
through
carter
s
valley
for
cumberland
gap
and
the
wilderness
trail
egad
cried
captain
sevier
i
have
so
many
times
found
the
boldest
plan
the
safest
that
i
have
become
a
coward
that
way
what
do
you
say
to
it
robertson
robertson
leaned
his
square
shoulders
over
the
table
he
may
fall
in
with
a
party
going
over
he
answered
without
looking
up
polly
ann
looked
at
tom
as
if
to
say
that
the
whole
continental
army
could
not
give
her
as
much
protection
we
left
that
hospitable
place
about
nine
o
clock
robertson
having
written
a
letter
to
colonel
daniel
boone
shut
up
in
the
fort
at
boonesboro
should
we
be
so
fortunate
as
to
reach
kaintuckee
and
another
to
a
young
gentleman
by
the
name
of
george
rogers
clark
apparently
a
leader
there
captain
sevier
bowed
over
polly
ann
s
hand
as
if
she
were
a
great
lady
and
wished
her
a
happy
honeymoon
and
me
he
patted
on
the
head
and
called
a
brave
lad
and
soon
we
had
passed
beyond
the
into
the
wilderness
again
our
way
was
down
the
nollichucky
past
the
great
bend
of
it
below
lick
creek
and
so
to
the
great
the
trail
by
which
countless
parties
of
red
marauders
had
travelled
north
and
south
it
led
indeed
northeast
between
the
mountain
ranges
although
we
kept
a
watch
by
day
and
night
we
saw
no
sign
of
dragging
canoe
or
his
men
and
at
length
we
forded
the
holston
and
came
to
the
scattered
settlement
in
carter
s
valley
i
have
since
racked
my
brain
to
remember
at
whose
cabin
we
stopped
there
he
was
a
rough
backwoodsman
with
a
wife
and
a
horde
of
children
but
i
recall
that
a
great
rain
came
out
of
the
mountains
and
down
the
valley
we
were
counting
over
the
powder
gourds
in
our
packs
when
there
burst
in
at
the
door
as
wild
a
man
as
has
ever
been
my
lot
to
see
his
brown
beard
was
grown
like
a
bramble
patch
his
eye
had
a
violet
light
and
his
hunting
shirt
was
in
tatters
he
was
thin
to
gauntness
ate
ravenously
of
the
food
that
was
set
before
him
and
throwing
off
his
soaked
moccasins
he
spread
his
scalded
feet
to
the
blaze
and
the
steaming
odor
of
drying
leather
filled
the
room
whar
be
ye
from
asked
tom
for
answer
the
man
bared
his
arm
then
his
shoulder
and
two
angry
scars
long
and
red
revealed
themselves
and
around
his
wrists
were
deep
gouges
where
he
had
been
bound
they
killed
sue
he
cried
sculped
her
afore
my
very
eyes
and
they
chopped
my
boy
outen
the
hickory
withes
and
carried
him
to
the
creek
nation
at
a
place
where
there
was
a
standin
stone
i
broke
loose
from
three
of
em
and
come
here
over
the
mountains
and
i
ain
t
had
nothin
stranger
but
berries
and
chainey
for
ten
days
god
damn
em
he
cried
standing
up
and
tottering
with
the
pain
in
his
feet
if
i
can
get
a
deckard
will
you
go
back
said
tom
go
back
he
shouted
i
ll
go
back
and
fight
em
while
i
have
blood
in
my
he
fell
into
a
bunk
but
his
sorrow
haunted
him
even
in
his
troubled
sleep
and
his
moans
awed
us
as
we
listened
the
next
day
he
told
us
his
story
with
more
calmness
it
was
horrible
indeed
and
might
well
have
frightened
a
less
courageous
woman
than
polly
ann
imploring
her
not
to
go
he
became
wild
again
and
brought
tears
to
her
eyes
when
he
spoke
of
his
own
wife
they
tomahawked
her
ma
am
because
she
could
not
walk
and
the
baby
beside
her
and
i
standing
by
with
my
arms
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
that
scene
and
how
tom
pleaded
with
polly
ann
to
stay
behind
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
you
re
going
tom
she
said
yes
he
answered
turning
away
i
gave
em
my
and
your
word
to
me
said
polly
ann
he
did
not
answer
we
fixed
on
a
saturday
to
start
to
give
the
horses
time
to
rest
and
in
the
hope
that
we
might
hear
of
some
relief
party
going
over
the
gap
on
thursday
tom
made
a
trip
to
the
store
in
the
valley
and
came
back
with
a
deckard
rifle
he
had
bought
for
the
stranger
whose
name
was
weldon
there
was
no
news
from
kaintuckee
but
the
carter
s
valley
settlers
seemed
to
think
that
matters
were
better
there
it
was
that
same
night
i
believe
that
two
men
arrived
from
fort
chiswell
one
whose
name
was
cutcheon
was
a
little
man
with
a
short
forehead
and
a
bad
eye
and
he
wore
a
blue
coat
of
military
cut
the
second
was
a
big
fleshy
man
and
a
loud
talker
he
wore
a
hunting
shirt
and
leggings
they
were
both
the
worse
for
rum
they
had
had
on
the
road
the
big
man
talking
very
loud
and
boastfully
afeard
to
go
to
kaintuckee
said
he
i
ve
met
a
parcel
o
cowards
on
the
road
turned
back
there
ain
t
nothin
to
be
afeard
of
eh
stranger
he
added
to
tom
who
paid
no
manner
of
attention
to
him
the
small
man
scarce
opened
his
mouth
but
sat
with
his
head
bowed
forward
on
his
breast
when
he
was
not
drinking
we
passed
a
dismal
crowded
night
in
the
room
with
such
companions
when
they
heard
that
we
were
to
go
over
the
mountains
nothing
would
satisfy
the
big
man
but
to
go
with
us
come
stranger
said
he
to
tom
two
good
rifles
such
as
we
is
ain
t
to
be
throwed
why
do
you
want
to
go
over
asked
tom
be
ye
a
tory
he
demanded
suspiciously
why
do
you
go
over
retorted
riley
for
that
was
his
name
i
reckon
i
m
no
more
of
a
tory
than
whar
did
ye
come
from
said
tom
chiswell
s
mines
taking
out
lead
for
the
army
o
congress
but
there
ain
t
excitement
enough
in
and
you
said
tom
turning
to
cutcheon
and
eying
his
military
coat
i
got
tired
of
their
damned
discipline
the
man
answered
surlily
he
was
a
deserter
look
you
said
tom
sternly
if
you
come
what
i
say
is
such
was
the
sacrifice
we
were
put
to
by
our
need
of
company
but
in
those
days
a
man
was
a
man
and
scarce
enough
on
the
wilderness
trail
in
that
year
of
so
we
started
away
from
carter
s
valley
on
a
bright
saturday
morning
the
grass
glistening
after
a
week
s
rain
the
road
sodden
and
the
smell
of
the
summer
earth
heavy
tom
and
weldon
walked
ahead
driving
the
two
horses
followed
by
cutcheon
his
head
dropped
between
his
shoulders
the
big
man
riley
regaled
polly
ann
my
pluck
is
said
he
my
pluck
is
to
give
a
redskin
no
chance
shoot
em
down
like
hogs
it
takes
a
good
un
to
stalk
me
ma
am
up
on
the
kanawha
i
ve
had
fights
with
em
and
made
em
cry
law
exclaimed
polly
ann
nudging
me
it
was
a
lucky
thing
we
run
into
you
in
the
but
presently
we
left
the
road
and
took
a
mountain
trail
as
stiff
a
climb
as
we
had
yet
had
polly
ann
went
up
it
like
a
bird
talking
all
the
while
to
riley
who
blew
like
a
bellows
for
once
he
was
silent
we
spent
two
perchance
three
days
climbing
and
descending
and
fording
at
night
tom
would
suffer
none
to
watch
save
weldon
and
himself
not
trusting
riley
or
cutcheon
and
the
rascals
were
well
content
to
sleep
at
length
we
came
to
a
cabin
on
a
creek
the
corn
between
the
stumps
around
it
choked
with
weeds
and
no
sign
of
smoke
in
the
chimney
behind
it
slanted
up
in
giant
steps
a
hill
of
a
thousand
feet
and
in
front
of
it
the
stream
was
dammed
and
lined
with
cane
who
keeps
house
cried
tom
at
the
threshold
he
pushed
back
the
door
fashioned
in
one
great
slab
from
a
forest
tree
his
welcome
was
an
angry
whir
and
a
huge
yellow
rattler
lay
coiled
within
his
head
reared
to
strike
polly
ann
leaned
back
mercy
she
cried
that
s
a
bad
but
tom
killed
the
snake
and
we
made
ready
to
use
the
cabin
that
night
and
the
next
day
for
the
horses
were
to
be
rested
and
meat
was
to
be
got
as
we
could
not
use
our
guns
so
freely
on
the
far
side
of
cumberland
gap
in
the
morning
before
he
and
weldon
left
tom
took
me
around
the
end
of
the
cabin
davy
said
he
i
don
t
trust
these
rascals
kin
you
shoot
a
pistol
i
reckoned
i
could
he
had
taken
one
out
of
the
pack
he
had
got
from
captain
sevier
and
pushed
it
between
the
logs
where
the
clay
had
fallen
out
if
they
try
anything
said
he
shoot
em
and
don
t
be
afeard
of
killing
he
patted
me
on
the
back
and
went
off
up
the
slope
with
weldon
polly
ann
and
i
stood
watching
them
until
they
were
out
of
sight
about
eleven
o
clock
riley
and
cutcheon
moved
off
to
the
edge
of
a
near
the
water
and
sat
there
for
a
while
talking
in
low
tones
the
horses
were
belled
and
spancelled
near
by
feeding
on
the
cane
and
wild
grass
and
polly
ann
was
cooking
on
a
stone
what
makes
you
so
sober
davy
she
said
i
didn
t
answer
davy
she
cried
be
happy
while

young

a
fine
day
and
kaintuckee
s
over
she
picked
up
her
skirts
and
sang
first
upon
the
heeltap
then
upon
the
the
men
by
the
turned
and
came
towards
us
ye
re

mis
mcchesney

riley

his
blustering
way

you
cried
polly
ann
with
flashing
eyes
do
you
hear
that
davy
i
did
meanwhile
the
man
cutcheon
was
slowly
walking
towards
her
it
took
scarce
a
second
for
me
to
make
up
my
mind
i
slipped
around
the
corner
of
the
house
seized
the
pistol
primed
it
with
a
trembling
hand
and
came
back
to
behold
polly
ann
with
flaming
cheeks
facing
them
they
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
me
riley
held
a
little
back
of
the
two
being
the
coward
but
cutcheon
stood
ready
like
a
wolf
i
did
not
wait
for
him
to
spring
but
taking
the
best
aim
i
could
with
my
two
hands
fired
with
a
curse
that
echoed
in
the
crags
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
forward
writhing
on
the
turf
run
for
the
cabin
polly
ann
i
shouted
and
bar
the
there
was
no
need
for
an
instant
riley
wavered
and
then
fled
to
the
cane
polly
ann
and
i
went
to
the
man
on
the
ground
and
turned
him
over
his
eyes
slid
upwards
there
was
a
bloody
froth
on
his
lips
davy
cried
she
awestricken
davy
ye
ve
killed
him
i
grew
dizzy
and
sick
at
the
thought
but
she
caught
me
and
held
me
to
her
presently
we
sat
down
on
the
door
log
gazing
at
the
corpse
then
i
began
to
reflect
and
took
out
my
powder
gourd
and
loaded
the
pistol
what
are
ye
she
said
in
case
the
other
one
comes
back
said
i
pooh
said
polly
ann
he
ll
not
come
which
was
true
i
have
never
laid
eyes
on
riley
to
this
day
i
reckon
we
d
better
fetch
it
out
of
the
sun
said
she
after
a
while
and
so
we
dragged
it
under
an
oak
covered
the
face
and
left
it
he
was
the
first
man
i
ever
killed
and
the
business
by
no
means
came
natural
to
me
and
that
day
the
which
polly
ann
had
made
were
untasted
by
us
both
the
afternoon
dragged
interminably
try
as
we
would
we
could
not
get
out
of
our
minds
the
thing
that
lay
under
the
oak
it
was
near
sundown
when
tom
and
weldon
appeared
on
the
mountain
side
carrying
a
buck
between
them
tom
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
keenly
he
was
very
quick
to
divine
whar
be
they
said
he
show
him
davy
said
polly
ann
i
took
him
over
to
the
oak
and
polly
ann
told
him
the
story
he
gave
me
one
look
i
remember
and
there
was
more
of
gratitude
in
it
than
in
a
thousand
words
then
he
seized
a
piece
of
cold
cake
from
the
stone
which
trace
did
he
take
he
demanded
of
me
but
polly
ann
hung
on
his
shoulder
tom
tom
she
cried
you
beant
goin
to
leave
us
again
tom
he
ll
die
in
the
wilderness
and
we
must
git
to
the
next
vivid
thing
in
my
memory
is
the
view
of
the
last
barrier
nature
had
reared
between
us
and
the
delectable
country
it
stood
like
a
lion
at
the
gateway
and
for
some
minutes
we
gazed
at
it
in
terror
from
powell
s
valley
below
how
many
thousands
have
looked
at
it
with
sinking
hearts
how
many
weaklings
has
its
frown
turned
back
there
seemed
to
be
engraved
upon
it
the
dark
history
of
the
dark
and
bloody
land
beyond
nothing
in
this
life
worth
having
is
won
for
the
asking
and
the
best
is
fought
for
and
bled
for
and
died
for
written
too
upon
that
towering
wall
of
white
rock
in
the
handwriting
of
god
himself
is
the
history
of
the
indomitable
race
to
which
we
belong
for
fifty
miles
we
travelled
under
it
towards
the
gap
our
eyes
drawn
to
it
by
a
resistless
fascination
the
sun
went
over
it
early
in
the
day
as
though
glad
to
leave
the
place
and
after
that
a
dark
scowl
would
settle
there
at
night
we
felt
its
presence
like
a
curse
even
polly
ann
was
silent
and
she
had
need
to
be
now
when
it
was
necessary
we
talked
in
low
tones
and
the
on
the
horses
were
not
loosed
at
night
it
was
here
but
four
years
gone
that
daniel
boone
s
family
was
attacked
and
his
son
killed
by
the
indians
we
passed
from
time
to
time
deserted
cabins
and
camps
and
some
places
that
might
once
have
been
called
settlements
elk
garden
where
the
pioneers
of
the
last
four
years
had
been
wont
to
lay
in
a
simple
supply
of
seed
corn
and
irish
potatoes
and
the
spot
where
henderson
and
his
company
had
camped
on
the
way
to
establish
boonesboro
two
years
before
and
at
last
we
struck
the
trace
that
mounted
upward
to
the
gateway
itself
chapter
ix
on
the
wilderness
trail
and
now
we
had
our
hands
upon
the
latch
and
god
alone
knew
what
was
behind
the
gate
toil
with
a
certainty
but
our
lives
had
known
it
death
perchance
but
death
had
been
near
to
all
of
us
and
his
presence
did
not
frighten
as
we
climbed
towards
the
gap
i
recalled
with
strange
aptness
a
quaint
saying
of
my
father
s
that
kaintuckee
was
the
garden
of
eden
and
that
men
were
being
justly
punished
with
blood
for
their
presumption
as
if
to
crown
that
judgment
the
day
was
dark
and
lowering
with
showers
of
rain
from
time
to
time
and
when
we
spoke
polly
ann
and
i
it
was
in
whispers
the
trace
was
very
narrow
with
daniel
boone
s
blazes
two
years
old
upon
the
trees
but
the
way
was
not
over
steep
cumberland
mountain
was
as
silent
and
deserted
as
when
the
first
man
had
known
it
alas
for
the
vanity
of
human
presage
we
gained
the
top
and
entered
unmolested
no
eden
suddenly
dazzled
our
eye
no
splendor
burst
upon
it
nothing
told
us
as
we
halted
in
our
weariness
that
we
had
reached
the
promised
land
the
mists
weighed
heavily
on
the
evergreens
of
the
slopes
and
hid
the
ridges
and
we
passed
that
night
in
cold
discomfort
it
was
the
first
of
many
without
a
fire
the
next
day
brought
us
to
the
cumberland
tawny
and
swollen
from
the
rains
and
here
we
had
to
stop
to
fell
trees
to
make
a
raft
on
which
to
ferry
over
our
packs
we
bound
the
logs
together
with
grapevines
and
as
we
worked
my
imagination
painted
for
me
many
a
red
face
peering
from
the
bushes
on
the
farther
shore
and
when
we
got
into
the
river
and
were
caught
and
spun
by
the
hurrying
stream
i
hearkened
for
a
shot
from
the
farther
bank
while
polly
ann
and
i
were
scrambling
to
get
the
raft
landed
tom
and
weldon
swam
over
with
the
horses
and
so
we
lay
the
second
night
dolefully
in
the
rain
but
not
so
much
as
a
whimper
escaped
from
polly
ann
i
have
often
told
her
since
that
the
sorest
trial
she
had
was
the
guard
she
kept
on
her
tongue
a
hardship
indeed
for
one
of
irish
inheritance
many
a
pull
had
she
lightened
for
us
by
a
flash
of
humor
the
next
morning
the
sun
relented
and
the
wine
of
his
dawn
was
wine
indeed
to
our
flagging
hopes
going
down
to
wash
at
the
river
s
brink
i
heard
a
movement
in
the
cane
and
stood
frozen
and
staring
until
a
great
bearded
head
black
as
tar
was
thrust
out
between
the
stalks
and
looked
at
me
with
blinking
red
eyes
the
next
step
revealed
the
hump
of
the
beast
and
the
next
his
tasselled
tail
lashing
his
dirty
brown
quarters
i
did
not
tarry
longer
but
ran
to
tell
tom
he
made
bold
to
risk
a
shot
and
light
a
fire
and
thus
we
had
buffalo
meat
for
some
days
after
we
were
still
in
the
mountains
the
trail
led
down
the
river
for
a
bit
through
the
worst
of
canebrakes
and
every
now
and
again
we
stopped
while
tom
and
weldon
scouted
once
the
roan
mare
made
a
dash
through
the
brake
and
though
polly
ann
burst
through
one
way
to
head
her
off
and
i
another
we
reached
the
bank
of
richland
creek
in
time
to
see
her
nose
and
the
top
of
her
pack
above
the
brown
water
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
swim
after
her
which
i
did
and
caught
her
quietly
feeding
in
the
cane
on
the
other
side
by
great
good
fortune
the
other
horse
bore
the
powder
drat
you
nancy
said
polly
ann
to
the
mare
as
she
handed
me
my
clothes
i
d
sooner
carry
the
pack
myself
than
be
bothered
with
hush
said
i
the
redskins
will
get
polly
ann
regarded
me
scornfully
as
i
stood
bedraggled
before
her
redskins
she
cried
nonsense
i
reckon
it
s
all
talk
about
but
we
had
scarce
caught
up
ere
we
saw
tom
standing
rigid
with
his
hand
raised
before
him
on
a
mound
bared
of
cane
were
the
charred
remains
of
a
fire
the
sight
of
them
transformed
weldon
his
eyes
glared
again
even
as
when
we
had
first
seen
him
curses
escaped
under
his
breath
and
he
would
have
darted
into
the
cane
had
not
tom
seized
him
sternly
by
the
shoulder
as
for
me
my
heart
hammered
against
my
ribs
and
i
grew
sick
with
listening
it
was
at
that
instant
that
my
admiration
for
tom
mcchesney
burst
bounds
and
that
i
got
some
real
inkling
of
what
woodcraft
might
be
stepping
silently
between
the
tree
trunks
his
eyes
bent
on
the
leafy
loam
he
found
a
footprint
here
and
another
there
and
suddenly
he
went
into
the
cane
with
a
sign
to
us
to
remain
it
seemed
an
age
before
he
returned
then
he
began
to
rake
the
ashes
and
suddenly
bending
down
seized
something
in
them
the
broken
bowl
of
an
indian
pipe
shawnees
he
said
i
reckoned
it
was
at
length
the
beseeching
in
polly
ann
s
eyes
that
he
answered
a
war
party
tracks
three
days
old
they
took
to
take
poplar
was
our
backwoods
expression
for
embarking
in
a
canoe
the
dugouts
being
fashioned
from
the
great
poplar
trees
i
did
not
reflect
then
as
i
have
since
and
often
how
great
was
the
knowledge
and
resource
tom
practised
that
day
our
feeling
for
him
polly
ann
s
and
mine
fell
little
short
of
worship
in
company
ill
at
ease
in
the
forest
he
became
silent
and
masterful
an
unerring
woodsman
capable
of
meeting
the
indian
on
his
own
footing
and
strangest
thought
of
all
he
and
many
i
could
name
who
went
into
kentucky
had
escaped
by
a
kind
of
strange
fate
being
born
in
the
north
of
ireland
this
was
so
of
andrew
jackson
himself
the
rest
of
the
day
he
led
us
in
silence
down
the
trace
his
eye
alert
to
penetrate
every
corner
of
the
forest
his
hand
near
the
trigger
of
his
long
deckard
i
followed
in
boylike
imitation
searching
every
thicket
for
alien
form
and
color
and
yearning
for
stature
and
responsibility
as
for
poor
weldon
he
would
stride
for
hours
at
a
time
with
eyes
fixed
ahead
a
wild
figure
ragged
and
fringed
and
we
knew
that
the
soul
within
him
was
torn
with
thoughts
of
his
dead
wife
and
of
his
child
in
captivity
again
when
the
trance
left
him
he
was
an
addition
to
our
little
party
not
to
be
despised
at
dark
polly
ann
and
i
carried
the
packs
across
a
creek
on
a
fallen
tree
she
taking
one
end
and
i
the
other
we
camped
there
where
the
loam
was
trampled
and
torn
by
countless
herds
of
bison
and
had
only
parched
corn
and
the
remains
of
a
buffalo
steak
for
supper
as
the
meal
was
mouldy
from
its
wetting
and
running
low
when
weldon
had
gone
a
little
distance
up
the
creek
to
scout
tom
relented
from
the
sternness
which
his
vigilance
imposed
and
came
and
sat
down
on
a
log
beside
polly
ann
and
me
tis
a
hard
journey
little
girl
he
said
patting
her
i
reckon
i
done
wrong
to
fetch
i
can
see
him
now
as
the
twilight
settled
down
over
the
wilderness
his
honest
face
red
and
freckled
but
aglow
with
the
tenderness
it
had
hidden
during
the
day
one
big
hand
enfolding
hers
and
the
other
on
my
shoulder
hark
davy
said
polly
ann
he
s
fair
tired
of
us
already
davy
take
me
hush
polly
ann
he
answered
delighted
at
her
raillery
but
i
ve
a
word
to
say
to
you
if
we
come
on
to
the
redskins
you
and
davy
make
for
the
cane
as
hard
as
you
kin
kilter
keep
out
of
as
hard
as
we
kin
kilter
exclaimed
polly
ann
indignantly
i
reckon
not
tom
mcchesney
davy
taught
me
to
shoot
long
ago
afore
you
made
up
your
mind
to
come
back
from
tom
chuckled
so
davy
taught
you
to
shoot
he
said
and
checked
himself
he
ain
t
such
a
bad
one
with
a
pistol
and
he
patted
me
but
i
allow
ye
d
better
hunt
kiver
just
the
same
and
if
they
ketch
ye
polly
ann
just
you
go
along
and
pretend
to
be
happy
and
tear
off
a
snatch
of
your
dress
now
and
then
if
you
get
a
chance
it
wouldn
t
take
me
but
a
little
time
to
run
into
harrodstown
or
boone
s
station
from
here
and
fetch
a
party
to
follow
two
days
went
by
two
days
of
strain
in
sunlight
and
of
watching
and
fitful
sleep
in
darkness
but
the
wilderness
trail
was
deserted
here
and
there
a
silent
remnant
of
the
year
gone
by
spoke
of
the
little
bands
of
emigrants
which
had
once
made
their
way
so
cheerfully
to
the
new
country
again
it
was
a
child
s
doll
the
rags
of
it
beaten
by
the
weather
to
a
rusty
hue
every
hour
that
we
progressed
seemed
to
justify
the
sagacity
and
boldness
of
tom
s
plan
nor
did
it
appear
to
have
entered
a
painted
skull
that
a
white
man
would
have
the
hardihood
to
try
the
trail
this
year
there
were
neither
signs
nor
sounds
save
nature
s
own
the
hoot
of
the
the
distant
bark
of
a
mountain
wolf
the
whir
of
a
partridge
as
she
left
her
brood
at
length
we
could
stand
no
more
the
repression
that
silence
and
watching
put
upon
us
and
when
a
rotten
bank
gave
way
and
flung
polly
ann
and
the
sorrel
mare
into
a
creek
even
weldon
smiled
as
we
pulled
her
bedraggled
and
laughing
from
the
muddy
water
this
was
after
we
had
ferried
the
rockcastle
river
our
trace
rose
and
fell
over
height
and
valley
until
we
knew
that
we
were
come
to
a
wonderland
at
last
we
stood
one
evening
on
a
spur
as
the
setting
sun
flooded
the
natural
park
below
us
with
a
crystal
light
and
striking
a
tall
sycamore
turned
its
green
to
gold
we
were
now
on
the
hills
whence
the
water
ran
down
to
nourish
the
fat
land
and
i
could
scarce
believe
that
the
garden
spot
on
which
our
eyes
feasted
could
be
the
scene
of
the
blood
and
suffering
of
which
we
had
heard
here
at
last
was
the
fairyland
of
my
childhood
the
country
beyond
the
blue
wall
we
went
down
the
river
that
led
into
it
with
awe
as
though
we
were
trespassers
against
god
himself
as
though
he
had
made
it
too
beautiful
and
too
fruitful
for
the
toilers
of
this
earth
and
you
who
read
this
an
hundred
years
hence
may
not
believe
the
marvels
of
it
to
the
pioneer
and
in
particular
to
one
born
and
bred
in
the
scanty
hard
soil
of
the
mountains
nature
had
made
it
for
her
park
ay
and
scented
it
with
her
own
perfumes
giant
trees
which
had
watched
generations
come
and
go
some
of
which
mayhap
had
been
saplings
when
the
norman
came
to
england
grew
in
groves
the
gnarled
and
twisted
oak
and
that
godsend
to
the
settlers
the
the
coffee
tree
with
its
drooping
buds
the
mulberry
the
cherry
and
the
plum
the
sassafras
and
the
pawpaw
the
poplar
and
the
sycamore
slender
maidens
of
the
forest
garbed
in
daintier
colors
ay
and
that
resplendent
brunette
with
the
white
flowers
the
magnolia
and
all
underneath
in
the
green
shade
enamelled
banks
which
the
birds
themselves
sought
to
rival
at
length
one
afternoon
we
came
to
the
grove
of
wild
apple
trees
so
lovingly
spoken
of
by
emigrants
as
the
crab
orchard
and
where
formerly
they
had
delighted
to
linger
the
plain
near
by
was
flecked
with
the
brown
backs
of
feeding
buffalo
but
we
dared
not
stop
and
pressed
on
to
find
a
camp
in
the
forest
as
we
walked
in
the
filtered
sunlight
we
had
a
great
fright
polly
ann
and
shrill
discordant
cries
suddenly
burst
from
the
branches
above
us
and
a
flock
of
strange
green
birds
flecked
with
red
flew
over
our
heads
even
tom
intent
upon
the
trail
turned
and
laughed
at
polly
ann
as
she
stood
clutching
me
shucks
said
he
they
re
only
we
made
our
camp
in
a
little
dell
where
there
was
short
green
grass
by
the
brookside
and
steep
banks
overgrown
with
brambles
on
either
hand
tom
knew
the
place
and
declared
that
we
were
within
thirty
miles
of
the
station
a
giant
oak
had
blown
down
across
the
water
and
cutting
out
a
few
branches
of
this
we
spread
our
blankets
under
it
on
the
turf
tethering
our
faithful
beasts
and
cutting
a
quantity
of
for
their
night
s
food
we
lay
down
to
sleep
tom
taking
the
first
watch
i
had
the
second
for
tom
trusted
me
now
and
glorying
in
that
trust
i
was
alert
and
vigilant
a
shy
moon
peeped
at
me
between
the
trees
and
was
fantastically
reflected
in
the
water
the
creek
rippled
over
the
limestone
and
an
elk
screamed
in
the
forest
far
beyond
when
at
length
i
had
called
weldon
to
take
the
third
watch
i
lay
down
with
a
sense
of
peace
soothed
by
the
sweet
odors
of
the
night
i
awoke
suddenly
i
had
been
dreaming
of
nick
temple
and
temple
bow
and
my
father
coming
back
to
me
there
with
a
great
gash
in
his
shoulder
like
weldon
s
i
lay
for
a
moment
dazed
by
the
transition
staring
through
the
gray
light
then
i
sat
up
the
soft
stamping
and
snorting
of
the
horses
in
my
ears
the
sorrel
mare
had
her
nose
high
her
tail
twitching
but
there
was
no
other
sound
in
the
leafy
wilderness
with
a
bound
of
returning
sense
i
looked
for
weldon
he
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
bank
above
his
body
dropped
across
the
trunk
of
the
oak
i
leaped
on
the
trunk
and
made
my
way
along
it
stepping
over
him
until
i
reached
and
hid
myself
in
the
great
roots
of
the
tree
on
the
bank
above
the
cold
shiver
of
the
dawn
was
in
my
body
as
i
waited
and
listened
should
i
wake
tom
the
vast
forest
was
silent
and
yet
in
its
shadowy
depths
my
imagination
drew
moving
forms
i
hesitated
the
light
grew
the
boles
of
the
trees
came
out
one
by
one
through
the
purple
the
tangled
mass
down
the
creek
took
on
a
shade
of
green
and
a
faint
breath
came
from
the
southward
the
sorrel
mare
sniffed
it
and
stamped
then
silence
again
a
long
silence
could
it
be
that
the
cane
moved
in
the
thicket
or
had
my
eyes
deceived
me
i
stared
so
hard
that
it
seemed
to
rustle
all
over
perhaps
some
deer
were
feeding
there
for
it
was
no
unusual
thing
when
we
rose
in
the
morning
to
hear
the
whistle
of
a
startled
doe
near
our
camping
ground
i
was
thoroughly
frightened
now
and
yet
i
had
the
speculative
scotch
mind
the
thicket
was
some
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
above
and
on
the
flooded
lands
at
a
bend
if
there
were
indians
in
it
they
could
not
see
the
sleeping
forms
of
our
party
under
me
because
of
a
bend
in
the
stream
they
might
have
seen
me
though
i
had
kept
very
still
in
the
twisted
roots
of
the
oak
and
now
i
was
cramped
if
indians
were
there
they
could
determine
our
position
well
enough
by
the
occasional
stamping
and
snorting
of
the
horses
and
this
made
my
fear
more
probable
for
i
had
heard
that
horses
and
cattle
often
warned
pioneers
of
the
presence
of
redskins
another
thing
if
they
were
a
small
party
they
would
probably
seek
to
surprise
us
by
coming
out
of
the
cane
into
the
creek
bed
above
the
bend
and
stalk
down
the
creek
if
a
large
band
they
would
surround
and
overpower
us
i
drew
the
conclusion
that
it
must
be
a
small
party
if
a
party
at
all
and
i
would
have
given
a
shot
in
the
arm
to
be
able
to
see
over
the
banks
of
the
creek
finally
i
decided
to
awake
tom
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
down
to
where
he
was
without
being
seen
by
eyes
in
the
cane
i
clung
to
the
under
branches
of
the
oak
finally
reached
the
shelving
bank
and
slid
down
slowly
i
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
awoke
with
a
start
and
by
instinct
seized
the
rifle
lying
beside
him
what
is
it
davy
he
whispered
i
told
what
had
happened
and
my
surmise
he
glanced
then
at
the
restless
horses
and
nodded
pointing
up
at
the
sleeping
figure
of
weldon
in
full
sight
on
the
log
the
indians
must
have
seen
him
tom
picked
up
the
spare
rifle
davy
said
he
you
stay
here
beside
polly
ann
behind
the
oak
you
kin
shoot
with
a
rest
but
don
t
shoot
said
he
earnestly
for
god
s
sake
don
t
shoot
unless
you
re
sure
to
i
nodded
for
a
moment
he
looked
at
the
face
of
polly
ann
sleeping
peacefully
and
the
fierce
light
faded
from
his
eyes
he
brushed
her
on
the
cheek
and
she
awoke
and
smiled
at
him
trustfully
lovingly
he
put
his
finger
to
his
lips
stay
with
davy
he
said
turning
to
me
he
added
when
you
wake
weldon
wake
him
easy
he
put
his
hand
in
mine
and
gradually
tightened
it
wake
him
that
way
and
he
won
t
polly
ann
asked
no
questions
she
looked
at
tom
and
her
soul
was
in
her
face
she
seized
the
pistol
from
the
blanket
then
we
watched
him
creeping
down
the
creek
on
his
belly
close
to
the
bank
next
we
moved
behind
the
fallen
tree
and
i
put
my
hand
in
weldon
s
he
woke
with
a
sigh
started
but
we
drew
him
down
behind
the
log
presently
he
climbed
cautiously
up
the
bank
and
took
station
in
the
muddy
roots
of
the
tree
then
we
waited
watching
tom
with
a
prayer
in
our
hearts
those
who
have
not
felt
it
know
not
the
fearfulness
of
waiting
for
an
indian
attack
at
last
tom
reached
the
bend
in
the
bank
beside
some
bushes
and
there
he
stayed
a
level
shaft
of
light
shot
through
the
forest
the
birds
twittering
awoke
a
great
hawk
soared
high
in
the
blue
over
our
heads
an
hour
passed
i
had
sighted
the
rifle
among
the
yellow
leaves
of
the
fallen
oak
an
hundred
times
but
polly
ann
looked
not
once
to
the
right
or
left
her
eyes
and
her
prayers
followed
the
form
of
her
husband
then
like
the
cracking
of
a
great
drover
s
whip
a
shot
rang
out
in
the
stillness
and
my
hands
tightened
over
the
a
piece
of
bark
struck
me
in
the
face
and
a
dead
leaf
fluttered
to
the
ground
almost
instantly
there
was
another
shot
and
a
blue
wisp
of
smoke
rose
from
the
bushes
where
tom
was
the
horses
whinnied
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
cane
and
silence
weldon
bent
over
my
god
he
whispered
hoarsely
he
hit
one
tom
hit
i
felt
polly
ann
s
hand
on
my
face
davy
dear
she
said
are
ye
hurt
no
said
i
dazed
and
wondering
why
weldon
had
not
been
shot
long
ago
as
he
slumbered
i
was
burning
to
climb
the
bank
and
ask
him
whether
he
had
seen
the
indian
fall
again
there
was
silence
a
silence
even
more
awful
than
before
the
sun
crept
higher
the
magic
of
his
rays
turning
the
creek
from
black
to
crystal
and
the
birds
began
to
sing
again
and
still
there
was
no
sign
of
the
treacherous
enemy
that
lurked
about
us
could
tom
get
back
i
glanced
at
polly
ann
the
same
question
was
written
in
her
yearning
eyes
staring
at
the
spot
where
the
gray
of
his
hunting
shirt
showed
through
the
bushes
at
the
bend
suddenly
her
hand
tightened
on
mine
the
hunting
shirt
was
gone
after
that
in
the
intervals
when
my
terror
left
me
i
tried
to
speculate
upon
the
plan
of
the
savages
their
own
numbers
could
not
be
great
and
yet
they
must
have
known
from
our
trace
how
few
we
were
scanning
the
ground
i
noted
that
the
forest
was
fairly
clean
of
undergrowth
on
both
sides
of
us
below
the
stream
ran
straight
but
there
were
growths
of
cane
and
briers
looking
up
i
saw
weldon
faced
about
it
was
the
obvious
move
but
where
had
tom
gone
next
my
eye
was
caught
by
a
little
run
fringed
with
bushes
that
curved
around
the
cane
near
the
bend
i
traced
its
course
unconsciously
bit
by
bit
until
it
reached
the
edge
of
a
bank
not
fifty
feet
away
all
at
once
my
breath
left
me
through
the
tangle
of
bramble
stems
at
the
mouth
of
the
run
above
naked
brown
shoulders
there
glared
at
me
hideously
streaked
with
red
a
face
had
my
fancy
lied
i
stared
again
until
my
eyes
were
blurred
now
tortured
by
doubt
now
so
completely
convinced
that
my
fingers
almost
released
the
trigger
for
i
had
thrown
the
sights
into
line
over
the
tree
i
know
not
to
this
day
whether
i
shot
from
determination
or
nervousness
my
shoulder
bruised
by
the
kick
the
smoke
like
a
veil
before
my
face
it
was
some
moments
ere
i
knew
that
the
air
was
full
of
whistling
bullets
and
then
the
gun
was
torn
from
my
hands
and
i
saw
polly
ann
ramming
in
a
new
charge
the
pistol
davy
she
cried
one
torture
was
over
another
on
crack
after
crack
sounded
from
the
forest
from
here
and
there
and
everywhere
it
seemed
and
with
a
song
that
like
a
hurtling
insect
ran
the
scale
of
notes
the
bullets
buried
themselves
in
the
trunk
of
our
oak
with
a
chug
once
in
a
while
i
heard
weldon
s
answering
shot
but
i
remembered
my
promise
to
tom
not
to
waste
powder
unless
i
were
sure
the
agony
was
the
breathing
space
we
had
while
they
crept
nearer
then
we
thought
of
tom
and
i
dared
not
glance
at
polly
ann
for
fear
that
the
sight
of
her
face
would
unnerve
me
then
a
longing
to
kill
seized
me
a
longing
so
strange
and
fierce
that
i
could
scarce
be
still
i
know
now
that
it
comes
in
battle
to
all
men
and
with
intensity
to
the
hunted
and
it
explained
to
me
more
clearly
what
followed
i
fairly
prayed
for
the
sight
of
a
painted
form
and
time
after
time
my
fancy
tricked
me
into
the
notion
that
i
had
one
and
even
as
i
searched
the
brambles
at
the
top
of
the
run
a
puff
of
smoke
rose
out
of
them
a
bullet
burying
itself
in
the
roots
near
weldon
who
fired
in
return
i
say
that
i
have
some
notion
of
what
possessed
the
man
for
he
was
crazed
with
passion
at
fighting
the
race
which
had
so
cruelly
wronged
him
i
saw
him
swing
down
from
the
bank
splash
through
the
water
with
raised
tomahawk
and
gain
the
top
of
the
run
in
less
time
than
it
takes
me
to
write
these
words
he
had
dragged
a
hideous
naked
warrior
out
of
the
brambles
and
with
an
avalanche
of
crumbling
earth
they
slid
into
the
waters
of
the
creek
polly
ann
and
i
stared
transfixed
at
the
fearful
fight
that
followed
nor
can
i
give
any
adequate
description
of
it
weldon
had
struck
through
the
brambles
but
the
savage
had
taken
the
blow
on
his
and
broken
the
handle
of
the
tomahawk
and
it
was
man
to
man
as
they
rolled
in
the
shallow
water
locked
in
a
death
embrace
neither
might
reach
for
his
knife
neither
was
able
to
hold
the
other
down
weldon
s
curses
surcharged
with
hatred
the
indian
straining
silently
save
for
a
gasp
or
a
guttural
note
the
white
a
bearded
madman
the
savage
a
devil
with
a
glistening
body
his
features
now
agonized
as
his
muscles
strained
and
cracked
now
lighted
with
a
diabolical
joy
but
the
rage
of
months
gave
the
white
man
strength
polly
ann
and
i
were
powerless
for
fear
of
shooting
weldon
and
gazed
absorbed
at
the
fiendish
scene
with
eyes
not
to
be
withdrawn
the
shook
a
long
bronze
arm
reached
out
from
above
and
a
painted
face
glowered
at
us
from
the
very
roots
where
weldon
had
lain
that
moment
i
took
to
be
my
last
and
in
it
i
seemed
to
taste
all
eternity
i
heard
but
faintly
a
noise
beyond
it
was
the
shock
of
the
heavy
indian
falling
on
polly
ann
and
me
as
we
cowered
under
the
trunk
and
even
then
there
was
an
instant
that
we
stood
gazing
at
him
as
at
a
worm
writhing
in
the
clay
it
was
she
who
fired
the
pistol
and
made
the
great
hole
in
his
head
and
so
he
twitched
and
died
after
that
a
confusion
of
shots
a
vision
of
two
naked
forms
flying
from
tree
to
tree
towards
the
cane
and
then
god
be
praised
tom
s
voice
shouting
polly
ann
polly
ann
before
she
had
reached
the
top
of
the
bank
tom
had
her
in
his
arms
and
a
dozen
tall
gray
figures
leaped
the
six
feet
into
the
stream
and
stopped
my
own
eyes
turned
with
theirs
to
see
the
body
of
poor
weldon
lying
face
downward
in
the
water
but
beyond
it
a
tragedy
awaited
me
defiant
immovable
save
for
the
heaving
of
his
naked
chest
the
savage
who
had
killed
him
stood
erect
with
folded
arms
facing
us
the
smoke
cleared
away
from
a
gleaming
and
the
brave
staggered
and
fell
and
died
as
silent
as
he
stood
his
feathers
making
ripples
in
the
stream
it
was
if
you
like
but
war
in
those
days
was
to
the
death
and
knew
no
mercy
the
tall
backwoodsman
who
had
shot
him
waded
across
the
stream
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
seized
the
and
ran
it
round
with
his
knife
holding
up
the
bleeding
trophy
with
a
shout
staggering
to
my
feet
i
stretched
myself
but
i
had
been
cramped
so
long
that
i
tottered
and
would
have
fallen
had
not
tom
s
hand
steadied
me
davy
he
cried
thank
god
little
davy
the
varmints
didn
t
get
and
you
tom
i
answered
looking
up
at
him
bewildered
with
happiness
they
was
nearer
than
i
suspicioned
when
i
went
off
he
said
and
looked
at
me
curiously
drat
the
little
deevil
he
said
affectionately
and
his
voice
trembled
he
took
care
of
polly
ann
i
ll
he
carried
me
to
the
top
of
the
bank
where
we
were
surrounded
by
the
whole
band
of
backwoodsmen
that
he
did
cried
polly
ann
and
fetched
a
redskin
yonder
as
clean
as
you
could
have
done
it
the
little
deevil
exclaimed
tom
again
i
looked
up
burning
with
this
praise
from
tom
for
i
had
never
thought
of
praise
nor
of
anything
save
his
happiness
and
polly
ann
s
i
looked
up
and
my
eyes
were
caught
and
held
with
a
strange
fascination
by
fearless
blue
ones
that
gazed
down
into
them
i
give
you
but
a
poor
description
of
the
owner
of
these
blue
eyes
for
personal
magnetism
springs
not
from
one
feature
or
another
he
was
a
young
man
perhaps
five
and
twenty
as
i
now
know
age
his
hair
might
have
been
orange
in
one
light
and
in
another
with
a
boy
s
sense
of
such
things
i
knew
that
the
other
woodsmen
were
waiting
for
him
to
speak
for
they
glanced
at
him
expectantly
you
had
a
near
call
mcchesney
said
he
at
length
fortunate
for
you
we
were
after
this
band
shot
some
of
it
to
pieces
yesterday
he
paused
looking
at
tom
with
that
quality
of
tribute
which
comes
naturally
to
a
leader
of
men
by
god
he
said
i
didn
t
think
you
d
try
my
word
is
good
colonel
clark
answered
tom
simply
young
colonel
clark
glanced
at
the
lithe
figure
of
polly
ann
he
seemed
a
man
of
few
words
for
he
did
not
add
to
his
praise
of
tom
s
achievement
by
complimenting
her
as
captain
sevier
had
done
in
fact
he
said
nothing
more
but
leaped
down
the
bank
and
strode
into
the
water
where
the
body
of
weldon
lay
and
dragged
it
out
himself
we
gathered
around
it
silently
and
two
great
tears
rolled
down
polly
ann
s
cheeks
as
she
parted
the
hair
with
tenderness
and
loosened
the
clenched
hands
nor
did
any
of
the
tall
woodsmen
speak
poor
weldon
the
tragedy
of
his
life
and
death
was
the
tragedy
of
kentucky
herself
they
buried
him
by
the
waterside
where
he
had
fallen
but
there
was
little
time
for
mourning
on
the
border
the
burial
finished
the
kentuckians
splashed
across
the
creek
and
one
of
them
stooping
with
a
shout
at
the
mouth
of
the
run
lifted
out
of
the
brambles
a
painted
body
with
drooping
head
and
feathers
trailing
ay
mac
he
cried
here
s
a
sculp
for
it
s
davy
s
exclaimed
polly
ann
from
the
top
of
the
bank
davy
shot
that
hooray
for
davy
cried
a
huge
strapping
backwoodsman
who
stood
beside
her
and
the
others
laughingly
took
up
the
shout
hooray
for
davy
bring
him
over
the
giant
threw
me
on
his
shoulder
as
though
i
had
been
a
fox
leaped
down
and
took
the
stream
in
two
strides
i
little
thought
how
often
he
was
to
carry
me
in
days
to
come
but
i
felt
a
great
awe
at
the
strength
of
him
as
i
stared
into
his
rough
features
and
his
veined
and
weathered
skin
he
stood
me
down
beside
the
indian
s
body
smiled
as
he
whipped
my
hunting
knife
from
my
belt
and
said
now
davy
take
the
nothing
loath
i
seized
the
indian
by
the
long
while
my
big
friend
guided
my
hand
and
amid
laughter
and
cheers
i
cut
off
my
first
trophy
of
war
nor
did
i
have
any
other
feeling
than
fierce
hatred
of
the
race
which
had
killed
my
father
those
who
have
known
armies
in
their
discipline
will
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
leadership
of
the
border
such
leadership
was
granted
only
to
those
whose
force
and
individuality
compelled
men
to
obey
them
i
had
my
first
glimpse
of
it
that
day
this
colonel
clark
to
whom
tom
delivered
robertson
s
letter
was
perchance
the
youngest
man
in
the
company
that
had
rescued
us
saving
only
a
slim
lad
of
seventeen
whom
i
noticed
and
envied
and
whose
name
was
james
ray
colonel
clark
so
i
was
told
by
my
friend
cowan
held
that
title
in
kentucky
by
reason
of
his
prowess
clark
had
been
standing
quietly
on
the
bank
while
i
had
scalped
my
first
redskin
then
he
called
tom
mcchesney
to
him
and
questioned
him
closely
about
our
journey
the
signs
we
had
seen
and
finally
the
news
in
the
watauga
settlements
while
this
was
going
on
the
others
gathered
round
them
what
now
asked
cowan
when
he
had
finished
back
to
harrodstown
answered
the
colonel
shortly
there
was
a
brief
silence
followed
by
a
hoarse
murmur
from
a
man
at
the
edge
of
the
crowd
who
shouldered
his
way
to
the
centre
of
it
we
set
out
to
hunt
a
fight
and
my
pluck
is
to
clean
up
we
ain
t
finished
em
the
man
had
a
deep
coarse
voice
that
was
a
piece
with
his
roughness
i
reckon
this
band
ain
t
to
harry
the
station
any
more
mcgary
cried
cowan
by
job
what
did
we
come
out
for
who
ll
take
the
trail
with
me
there
were
some
who
answered
him
and
straightway
they
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
filling
the
woods
with
a
babel
of
voices
while
i
stood
listening
to
these
disputes
with
a
boy
s
awe
of
a
man
s
quarrel
what
was
my
astonishment
to
feel
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
it
was
colonel
clark
s
and
he
was
not
paying
the
least
attention
to
the
dispute
davy
said
he
you
look
as
if
you
could
make
a
yes
sir
i
answered
gasping
well
said
he
make
i
lighted
a
piece
of
punk
with
the
flint
and
wrapping
it
up
in
some
dry
brush
soon
had
a
blaze
started
looking
up
i
caught
his
eye
on
me
again
mrs
mcchesney
said
colonel
clark
to
polly
ann
you
look
as
if
you
could
make
have
you
any
meal
that
i
have
cried
polly
ann
though
it
s
fair
mouldy
davy
run
and
fetch
i
ran
to
the
pack
on
the
sorrel
mare
when
i
returned
clark
said
that
seems
a
handy
boy
handy
cried
polly
ann
i
reckon
he
s
more
than
handy
didn
t
he
save
my
life
twice
on
our
way
out
here
and
how
was
that
said
the
colonel
run
and
fetch
some
water
davy
said
polly
ann
and
straightway
launched
forth
into
a
vivid
description
of
my
exploits
as
she
mixed
the
meal
nay
she
went
so
far
as
to
tell
how
she
came
by
me
the
young
colonel
listened
gravely
though
with
a
gleam
now
and
then
in
his
blue
eyes
leaning
on
his
long
rifle
he
paid
no
manner
of
attention
to
the
angry
voices
near
by
which
conduct
to
me
was
little
short
of
the
marvellous
now
davy
said
he
at
length
the
rest
of
your
there
is
little
of
it
sir
i
answered
i
was
born
in
the
yadkin
country
lived
alone
with
my
father
who
was
a
scotchman
he
hated
a
man
named
cameron
took
me
to
charlestown
and
left
me
with
some
kin
of
his
who
had
a
place
called
temple
bow
and
went
off
to
fight
cameron
and
the
there
i
gulped
he
was
killed
at
cherokee
ford
and
and
i
ran
away
from
temple
bow
and
found
polly
this
time
i
caught
something
of
surprise
on
the
colonel
s
face
by
thunder
davy
said
he
but
you
have
a
clean
gift
for
brief
narrative
where
did
you
learn
it
my
father
was
a
gentleman
once
and
taught
me
to
speak
and
read
i
answered
as
i
brought
a
flat
piece
of
limestone
for
polly
ann
s
baking
and
what
would
you
like
best
to
be
when
you
grow
up
davy
he
asked
six
feet
said
i
so
promptly
that
he
laughed
faith
said
polly
ann
looking
at
me
comically
he
may
be
many
things
but
i
ll
warrant
he
ll
never
be
i
have
often
thought
since
that
young
clark
showed
much
of
the
wisdom
of
the
famous
king
of
israel
on
that
day
polly
ann
cooked
a
piece
of
a
deer
which
one
of
the
woodsmen
had
with
him
and
the
quarrel
died
of
itself
when
we
sat
down
to
this
and
the
by
noon
we
had
taken
up
the
trace
for
harrodstown
marching
with
scouts
ahead
and
behind
clark
walked
mostly
alone
seemingly
wrapped
in
thought
at
times
he
had
short
talks
with
different
men
oftenest
i
noted
with
pride
with
tom
mcchesney
and
more
than
once
when
he
halted
he
called
me
to
him
my
answers
to
his
questions
seeming
to
amuse
him
indeed
i
became
a
kind
of
pet
with
the
backwoodsmen
cowan
often
flinging
me
to
his
shoulder
as
he
swung
along
the
pack
was
taken
from
the
sorrel
mare
and
divided
among
the
party
and
polly
ann
made
to
ride
that
we
might
move
the
faster
it
must
have
been
the
next
afternoon
about
four
that
the
rough
stockade
of
harrodstown
greeted
our
eyes
as
we
stole
cautiously
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
the
sight
of
no
roofs
and
spires
could
have
been
more
welcome
than
that
of
these
logs
and
cabins
broiling
in
the
midsummer
sun
at
a
little
distance
from
the
fort
a
silent
testimony
of
siege
the
stumpy
cleared
fields
were
overgrown
with
weeds
tall
and
rank
the
corn
choked
nearer
the
stockade
where
the
keepers
of
the
fort
might
venture
out
at
times
a
more
orderly
growth
met
the
eye
it
was
young
james
ray
whom
colonel
clark
singled
to
creep
with
our
message
to
the
gates
at
six
when
the
smoke
was
rising
from
the
stone
chimneys
behind
the
palisades
ray
came
back
to
say
that
all
was
well
then
we
went
forward
quickly
hands
waved
a
welcome
above
the
logs
the
great
wooden
gates
swung
open
and
at
last
we
had
reached
the
haven
for
which
we
had
suffered
so
much
mangy
dogs
barked
at
our
feet
men
and
women
ran
forward
joyfully
to
seize
our
hands
and
greet
us
and
so
we
came
to
kaintuckee
chapter
harrodstown
the
old
forts
like
harrodstown
and
boonesboro
and
logan
s
at
asaph
s
have
long
since
passed
away
it
is
many
many
years
since
i
lived
through
that
summer
of
siege
in
harrodstown
the
horrors
of
it
are
faded
and
dim
the
discomforts
lost
to
a
boy
thrilled
with
a
new
experience
i
have
read
in
my
old
age
the
books
of
travellers
in
kentucky
english
and
french
who
wrote
much
of
squalor
and
strife
and
sin
and
little
of
those
qualities
that
go
to
the
conquest
of
an
empire
and
the
making
of
a
people
perchance
my
own
pages
may
be
colored
by
gratitude
and
love
for
the
pioneers
amongst
whom
i
found
myself
and
thankfulness
to
god
that
we
had
reached
them
alive
i
know
not
how
many
had
been
cooped
up
in
the
little
fort
since
the
early
spring
awaiting
the
chance
to
go
back
to
their
clearings
the
fort
at
harrodstown
was
like
an
hundred
others
i
have
since
seen
but
sufficiently
surprising
to
me
then
imagine
a
great
parallelogram
made
of
log
cabins
set
end
to
end
their
common
outside
wall
being
the
wall
of
the
fort
and
loopholed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
parallelogram
the
cabins
jutted
out
with
ports
in
the
angle
in
order
to
give
a
flanking
fire
in
case
the
savages
reached
the
palisade
and
then
there
were
huge
log
gates
with
on
either
side
where
sentries
sat
day
and
night
scanning
the
forest
line
within
the
fort
was
a
big
common
dotted
with
forest
trees
where
such
cattle
as
had
been
saved
browsed
on
the
scanty
grass
there
had
been
but
the
one
scrawny
horse
before
our
arrival
and
the
settlers
how
shall
i
describe
them
as
they
crowded
around
us
inside
the
gate
some
stared
at
us
with
sallow
faces
and
eyes
brightened
by
the
fever
yet
others
had
the
red
glow
of
health
many
of
the
men
wore
rough
beards
unkempt
and
yellow
hunting
shirts
often
stained
with
blood
the
barefooted
women
wore
sunbonnets
and
loose
homespun
gowns
some
of
linen
made
from
nettles
while
the
children
swarmed
here
and
there
and
everywhere
in
any
costume
that
chance
had
given
them
all
seemingly
talking
at
once
they
plied
us
with
question
after
question
of
the
trace
the
watauga
settlements
the
news
in
the
carolinys
and
how
the
war
went
a
lad
is
it
this
one
said
an
irish
voice
near
me
and
a
woman
the
dear
help
us
and
who
d
ave
thought
to
see
a
woman
come
over
the
mountain
this
year
where
did
ye
find
them
bill
cowan
near
the
crab
orchard
and
the
lad
killed
and
sculped
a
the
saints
save
us
and
what
ll
be
his
name
davy
said
my
friend
is
it
davy
sure
his
namesake
killed
a
giant
and
is
he
come
along
also
said
another
his
shy
blue
eyes
and
stiff
blond
hair
gave
him
a
strange
appearance
in
a
hunting
shirt
hist
to
him
who
will
ye
be
talkin
about
poulsson
is
it
king
david
ye
mane
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
and
this
was
my
introduction
to
terence
mccann
and
swein
poulsson
the
fort
being
crowded
we
were
put
into
a
cabin
with
terence
and
cowan
and
cowan
s
wife
a
tall
gaunt
woman
with
a
sharp
tongue
and
a
kind
heart
and
her
four
brats
all
hugemsmug
together
as
cowan
said
and
that
night
we
supped
upon
dried
buffalo
meat
and
boiled
for
of
such
was
the
fare
in
harrodstown
that
summer
tom
mcchesney
kept
his
one
other
man
was
to
keep
his
faith
with
the
little
community
george
rogers
clark
and
i
soon
learned
that
trustworthiness
is
held
in
greater
esteem
in
a
border
community
than
anywhere
else
of
course
the
love
of
the
frontier
was
in
the
grain
of
these
men
but
what
did
they
come
back
to
day
after
day
would
the
sun
rise
over
the
forest
and
beat
down
upon
the
little
enclosure
in
which
we
were
penned
the
row
of
cabins
leaning
against
the
stockade
marked
the
boundaries
of
our
diminutive
world
beyond
them
invisible
lurked
a
relentless
foe
within
the
greater
souls
alone
were
calm
and
a
man
s
worth
was
set
down
to
a
hair
s
breadth
some
were
always
to
be
found
squatting
on
their
cursing
the
hour
which
had
seen
them
depart
for
this
land
some
wrestled
and
fought
on
the
common
for
a
fist
fight
with
a
fair
field
and
no
favor
was
a
favorite
amusement
of
the
backwoodsmen
my
big
friend
cowan
was
the
champion
of
these
and
often
of
an
evening
the
whole
of
the
inhabitants
would
gather
near
the
spring
to
see
him
fight
those
who
had
the
courage
to
stand
up
to
him
his
muscles
were
like
hickory
wood
and
i
have
known
a
man
insensible
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
one
of
his
blows
strangely
enough
he
never
fought
in
anger
and
was
the
first
to
the
spring
for
a
gourd
of
water
after
the
fight
was
over
but
tom
mcchesney
was
the
best
wrestler
of
the
lot
and
could
make
a
wider
leap
than
any
other
man
in
harrodstown
tom
s
reputation
did
not
end
there
for
he
became
one
of
the
two
of
the
station
i
would
better
have
said
meatwinners
woe
be
to
the
incautious
who
lulled
by
a
week
of
fancied
security
ventured
out
into
the
dishevelled
field
for
a
little
food
in
the
early
days
of
the
siege
man
after
man
had
gone
forth
for
game
never
to
return
until
tom
came
one
only
had
been
successful
that
lad
of
seventeen
whose
achievements
were
the
envy
of
my
boyish
soul
james
ray
he
slept
in
the
cabin
next
to
cowan
s
and
long
before
the
dawn
had
revealed
the
forest
line
had
been
wont
to
steal
out
of
the
gates
on
the
one
scrawny
horse
the
indians
had
left
them
gain
the
salt
river
and
make
his
way
thence
through
the
water
to
some
distant
place
where
the
listening
savages
could
not
hear
his
shot
and
now
tom
took
his
turn
often
did
i
sit
with
polly
ann
till
midnight
in
the
sentry
s
tower
straining
my
ears
for
the
owl
s
hoot
that
warned
us
of
his
coming
sometimes
he
was
but
sometimes
a
deer
hung
limp
and
black
across
his
saddle
or
a
pair
of
turkeys
swung
from
his
shoulder
arrah
darlin
said
terence
to
polly
ann
tis
yer
husband
and
james
is
the
jools
av
the
fort
sure
i
niver
loved
me
father
as
i
do
i
would
have
given
kingdoms
in
those
days
to
have
been
seventeen
and
james
ray
when
he
was
in
the
fort
i
dogged
his
footsteps
and
listened
with
a
painful
yearning
to
the
stories
of
his
escapes
from
the
roving
bands
and
as
many
a
character
is
watered
in
its
growth
by
so
my
own
grew
firmer
in
the
contemplation
of
ray
s
resourcefulness
my
strange
life
had
far
removed
me
from
lads
of
my
own
age
and
he
took
a
fancy
to
me
perhaps
because
of
the
very
persistence
of
my
devotion
to
him
i
cleaned
his
gun
filled
his
powder
flask
and
ran
to
do
his
every
bidding
i
used
in
the
hot
summer
days
to
lie
under
the
elm
tree
and
listen
to
the
settlers
talk
about
a
man
named
henderson
who
had
bought
a
great
part
of
kentucky
from
the
indians
and
had
gone
out
with
boone
to
found
boonesboro
some
two
years
before
they
spoke
of
much
that
i
did
not
understand
concerning
the
discountenance
by
virginia
of
these
claims
speculating
as
to
whether
henderson
s
grants
were
good
for
some
of
them
held
these
grants
and
others
virginia
grants
a
fruitful
source
of
quarrel
between
them
some
spoke
too
of
washington
and
his
ragged
soldiers
going
up
and
down
the
old
colonies
and
fighting
for
a
freedom
which
there
seemed
little
chance
of
getting
but
their
anger
seemed
to
blaze
most
fiercely
when
they
spoke
of
a
mysterious
british
general
named
hamilton
whom
they
called
the
ha
r
buyer
and
who
from
his
stronghold
in
the
north
country
across
the
great
ohio
sent
down
these
hordes
of
savages
to
harry
us
i
learned
to
hate
hamilton
with
the
rest
and
pictured
him
with
the
visage
of
a
fiend
we
laid
at
his
door
every
outrage
that
had
happened
at
the
three
stations
and
put
upon
him
the
blood
of
those
who
had
been
carried
off
to
torture
in
the
indian
villages
of
the
northern
forests
and
when
amidst
great
excitement
a
spent
runner
would
arrive
from
boonesboro
or
asaph
s
and
beg
clark
for
a
squad
it
was
commonly
with
the
first
breath
that
came
into
his
body
that
he
cursed
hamilton
so
the
summer
wore
away
while
we
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
on
such
scanty
fare
as
the
two
of
them
shot
and
what
we
could
venture
to
gather
in
the
unkempt
fields
near
the
gates
a
winter
of
famine
lurked
ahead
and
men
were
goaded
near
to
madness
at
the
thought
of
clearings
made
and
corn
planted
in
the
spring
within
reach
of
their
hands
as
it
were
and
they
might
not
harvest
it
at
length
when
a
fortnight
had
passed
and
tom
and
ray
had
gone
forth
day
after
day
without
sight
or
fresh
sign
of
indians
the
weight
lifted
from
our
hearts
there
were
many
things
that
might
yet
be
planted
and
come
to
maturity
before
the
late
kentucky
frosts
the
pressure
within
the
fort
like
a
flood
opened
the
gates
of
it
despite
the
sturdily
disapproving
figure
of
a
young
man
who
stood
silent
under
the
sentry
box
leaning
on
his
deckard
he
was
colonel
george
rogers
clark
of
the
backwoodsmen
of
kentucky
whose
power
was
reënforced
by
that
strange
thing
called
an
education
it
was
this
no
doubt
gave
him
command
of
words
when
he
chose
to
use
them
it
appears
that
clark
had
not
yet
received
the
title
of
colonel
though
he
held
editor
faith
said
terence
as
we
passed
him
tis
a
foine
man
he
is
and
a
gintleman
born
wasn
t
it
him
gathered
the
convintion
here
in
harrodstown
last
year
that
chose
him
and
another
to
go
to
the
virginia
legislatoor
and
him
but
a
lad
ye
might
say
the
divil
fly
away
wid
his
caution
sure
the
redskins
is
as
toired
as
us
and
gone
home
to
the
wives
and
childher
bad
cess
to
and
so
the
first
day
the
gates
were
opened
we
went
into
the
fields
a
little
way
and
the
next
day
a
little
farther
they
had
once
seemed
to
me
an
unexplored
and
forbidden
country
as
i
searched
them
with
my
eyes
from
the
sentry
boxes
and
yet
i
felt
a
shame
to
go
with
polly
ann
and
cowan
and
the
women
while
james
ray
and
tom
sat
with
the
guard
of
men
between
us
and
the
forest
line
like
a
child
on
a
holiday
polly
ann
ran
hither
and
thither
among
the
stalks
her
black
hair
flying
and
a
song
on
her
lips
soon
we
ll
be
having
a
little
home
of
our
own
davy
she
cried
tom
has
the
place
chose
on
a
knoll
by
the
river
and
the
land
is
rich
with
hickory
and
pawpaw
i
reckon
we
may
be
going
there
next
caution
being
born
into
me
with
all
the
strength
of
a
vice
i
said
nothing
whereupon
she
seized
me
in
her
strong
hands
and
shook
me
ye
little
imp
said
she
while
the
women
paused
in
their
work
to
laugh
at
us
the
boy
is
right
polly
ann
said
harrod
and
he
s
got
more
sense
than
most
of
the
men
in
the
ay
that
he
has
the
gaunt
cowan
put
in
eying
me
fiercely
while
she
gave
one
of
her
own
offsprings
a
slap
that
sent
him
spinning
whatever
polly
ann
might
have
said
would
have
been
to
the
point
but
it
was
lost
for
just
then
the
sound
of
a
shot
came
down
the
wind
and
a
half
a
score
of
women
stampeded
through
the
stalks
carrying
me
down
like
a
reed
before
them
when
i
staggered
to
my
feet
polly
ann
and
cowan
and
harrod
were
standing
alone
for
there
was
little
of
fear
in
those
three
shucks
said
cowan
i
reckon
it
s
that
jim
ray
shooting
at
a
mark
and
she
began
to
pick
nettles
again
vimmen
is
a
shy
critter
remarked
swein
poulsson
coming
up
i
had
a
shrewd
notion
that
he
had
run
with
the
others
wimmen
cowan
fairly
roared
wimmen
tell
us
how
ye
went
in
march
with
the
boys
to
fight
the
varmints
at
the
sugar
orchard
swein
we
all
laughed
for
we
loved
him
none
the
less
his
little
blue
eyes
were
perfectly
solemn
as
he
answered
ve
send
you
fight
injuns
mit
your
tongue
cowan
then
we
haf
no
more
land
of
canaan
cried
she
i
reckon
i
could
do
more
harm
with
it
than
you
with
a
there
were
many
such
false
alarms
in
the
bright
days
following
and
never
a
bullet
sped
from
the
shadow
of
the
forest
each
day
we
went
farther
afield
and
each
night
trooped
merrily
in
through
the
gates
with
hopes
of
homes
and
clearings
rising
in
our
hearts
until
the
motionless
figure
of
the
young
virginian
met
our
eye
it
was
then
that
men
began
to
scoff
at
him
behind
his
back
though
some
spoke
with
sufficient
backwoods
bluntness
to
his
face
and
yet
he
gave
no
sign
of
anger
or
impatience
not
so
the
other
leaders
no
sooner
did
the
danger
seem
past
than
bitter
strife
sprang
up
within
the
walls
even
the
two
captains
were
mortal
enemies
one
was
harrod
a
tall
spare
man
of
great
endurance
a
type
of
the
best
that
conquered
the
land
for
the
nation
the
other
that
hugh
mcgary
of
whom
i
have
spoken
coarse
and
brutal
if
you
like
but
fearless
and
a
leader
of
men
withal
a
certain
sunday
morning
i
remember
broke
with
a
sky
and
as
we
were
preparing
to
go
afield
with
such
ploughs
as
could
be
got
together
we
were
to
sow
turnips
the
loud
sounds
of
a
quarrel
came
from
the
elm
at
the
spring
with
one
accord
men
and
women
and
children
flocked
thither
and
as
we
ran
we
heard
mcgary
s
voice
above
the
rest
worming
my
way
boylike
through
the
crowd
i
came
upon
mcgary
and
harrod
glaring
at
each
other
in
the
centre
of
it
by
job
there
s
no
devil
if
i
ll
stand
back
from
my
clearing
and
waste
the
rest
of
the
summer
for
the
fears
of
a
pack
of
cowards
i
ll
take
a
posse
and
march
to
shawanee
springs
this
day
and
see
any
man
a
fair
fight
that
tries
to
stop
and
who
s
in
command
here
demanded
harrod
i
am
for
one
said
mcgary
with
an
oath
and
my
corn
s
on
the
ear
i
ve
held
back
long
enough
i
tell
you
and
i
ll
starve
this
winter
for
you
nor
any
one
harrod
turned
where
s
clark
he
said
to
bowman
clark
roared
mcgary
clark
be
d
ye
d
think
he
was
a
he
strode
up
to
harrod
until
their
faces
almost
touched
and
his
voice
shook
with
the
intensity
of
his
anger
by
g
d
you
nor
clark
nor
any
one
else
will
stop
me
i
say
he
swung
around
and
faced
the
people
come
on
boys
we
ll
fetch
that
corn
or
know
the
reason
a
responding
murmur
showed
that
the
bulk
of
them
were
with
him
weary
of
the
life
longing
for
action
and
starved
for
a
good
meal
the
anger
of
his
many
followers
against
clark
and
harrod
was
nigh
as
great
as
his
he
started
roughly
to
shoulder
his
way
out
and
whether
from
accident
or
design
captain
harrod
slipped
in
front
of
him
i
never
knew
the
thing
that
followed
happened
quickly
as
the
catching
of
my
breath
i
saw
mcgary
powdering
his
pan
and
harrod
his
and
felt
the
crowd
giving
back
like
buffalo
all
at
once
the
circle
had
vanished
and
the
two
men
were
standing
not
five
paces
apart
with
their
rifles
clutched
across
their
bodies
each
watching
catlike
for
the
other
to
level
it
was
a
cry
that
startled
us
and
them
there
was
a
vision
of
a
woman
flying
across
the
common
and
we
saw
the
dauntless
harrod
snatching
her
husband
s
gun
from
his
resisting
hands
so
she
saved
his
life
and
mcgary
s
at
this
point
colonel
clark
was
seen
coming
from
the
gate
when
he
got
to
harrod
and
mcgary
the
quarrel
blazed
up
again
but
now
it
was
between
the
three
of
them
and
clark
took
harrod
s
rifle
from
harrod
and
held
it
however
it
was
presently
decided
that
mcgary
should
wait
one
more
day
before
going
to
his
clearing
whereupon
the
gates
were
opened
the
picked
men
going
ahead
to
take
station
as
a
guard
and
soon
we
were
hard
at
work
ploughing
here
and
mowing
there
and
in
another
place
putting
seed
in
the
ground
in
the
cheer
of
the
work
hardships
were
forgotten
and
we
paused
now
and
again
to
laugh
at
some
sally
of
terence
mccann
s
or
odd
word
of
swein
poulsson
s
as
the
day
wore
on
to
afternoon
a
blue
haze
harbinger
of
autumn
settled
over
fort
and
forest
bees
hummed
in
the
air
as
they
searched
hither
and
thither
amongst
the
flowers
or
shot
straight
as
a
bullet
for
a
distant
hive
but
presently
a
rifle
cracked
and
we
raised
our
heads
hist
said
terence
the
bhoys
on
watch
is
that
warlike
whin
there
s
no
redskins
to
kill
they
must
be
wastin
good
powdher
on
a
i
leaped
upon
a
stump
and
scanned
the
line
of
sentries
between
us
and
the
woods
only
their
heads
and
shoulders
appeared
above
the
rank
growth
i
saw
them
looking
from
one
to
another
questioningly
some
shouting
words
i
could
not
hear
then
i
saw
some
running
and
next
as
i
stood
there
wondering
came
another
crack
and
then
a
volley
like
the
noise
of
a
great
fire
licking
into
dry
wood
and
things
that
were
not
bees
humming
round
about
a
distant
man
in
a
yellow
hunting
shirt
stumbled
and
was
drowned
in
the
tangle
as
in
water
around
me
men
dropped
and
women
baskets
and
as
we
ran
our
legs
grew
numb
and
our
bodies
cold
at
a
sound
which
had
haunted
us
in
dreams
by
night
the
the
deep
and
guttural
song
of
it
rose
and
fell
with
a
horrid
fierceness
an
agonized
voice
was
in
my
ears
and
i
halted
ashamed
it
was
polly
ann
s
davy
she
cried
davy
have
ye
seen
tom
two
men
dashed
by
i
seized
one
by
the
fringe
of
his
shirt
and
he
flung
me
from
my
feet
the
other
leaped
me
as
i
knelt
run
ye
fools
he
shouted
but
we
stood
still
with
yearning
eyes
staring
back
through
the
frantic
forms
for
a
sight
of
tom
s
i
ll
go
back
i
cried
i
ll
go
back
for
him
do
you
run
to
the
for
suddenly
i
seemed
to
forget
my
fear
nor
did
even
the
hideous
notes
of
the
scalp
halloo
disturb
me
before
polly
ann
could
catch
me
i
had
turned
and
started
stumbled
i
thought
on
a
stump
and
fallen
headlong
among
the
nettles
with
a
stinging
pain
in
my
leg
staggering
to
my
feet
i
tried
to
run
on
fell
again
and
putting
down
my
hand
found
it
smeared
with
blood
a
man
came
by
paused
an
instant
while
his
eye
caught
me
and
ran
on
again
i
shall
remember
his
face
and
name
to
my
dying
day
but
there
is
no
reason
to
put
it
down
here
in
a
few
seconds
space
as
i
lay
i
suffered
all
the
pains
of
captivity
and
of
death
by
torture
that
cry
of
savage
man
an
hundred
times
more
frightful
than
savage
beast
sounding
in
my
ears
and
plainly
nearer
now
by
half
the
first
distance
nearer
and
nearer
yet
and
then
i
heard
my
name
called
i
was
lifted
from
the
ground
and
found
myself
in
the
lithe
arms
of
polly
ann
set
me
down
i
screamed
set
me
down
and
must
have
added
some
of
the
curses
i
had
heard
in
the
fort
but
she
clutched
me
tightly
god
bless
the
memory
of
those
frontier
women
and
flew
like
a
deer
toward
the
gates
over
her
shoulder
i
glanced
back
a
spare
three
hundred
yards
away
in
a
ragged
line
a
hundred
red
devils
were
bounding
after
us
with
feathers
flying
and
mouths
open
as
they
yelled
again
i
cried
to
her
to
set
me
down
but
though
her
heart
beat
faster
and
her
breath
came
shorter
she
held
me
the
tighter
second
by
second
they
gained
on
us
relentlessly
were
we
near
the
fort
hoarse
shouts
answered
the
question
but
they
seemed
distant
too
distant
the
savages
were
gaining
and
polly
ann
s
breath
quicker
still
she
staggered
but
the
brave
soul
had
no
thought
of
faltering
i
had
a
sight
of
a
man
on
a
plough
horse
with
dangling
harness
coming
up
from
somewhere
of
the
man
leaping
off
of
ourselves
being
pitched
on
the
animal
s
bony
back
and
clinging
there
at
the
gallop
the
man
running
at
the
side
shots
whistled
over
our
heads
and
here
was
the
brown
fort
its
big
gates
swung
together
as
we
dashed
through
the
narrowed
opening
then
as
he
lifted
us
off
i
knew
that
the
man
who
had
saved
us
was
tom
himself
the
gates
closed
with
a
bang
and
a
patter
of
bullets
beat
against
them
like
rain
through
the
shouting
and
confusion
came
a
cry
in
a
voice
i
knew
now
pleading
now
commanding
open
open
for
god
s
sake
open
it
s
ray
open
for
ray
ray
s
out
some
were
seizing
the
bar
to
thrust
it
back
when
the
heavy
figure
of
mcgary
crushed
into
the
crowd
beside
it
by
job
i
ll
shoot
the
man
that
touches
it
he
shouted
as
he
tore
them
away
but
the
sturdiest
of
them
went
again
to
it
and
cursed
him
and
while
they
fought
backward
and
forward
the
lad
s
mother
ray
cried
out
to
them
to
open
in
tones
to
rend
their
hearts
but
mcgary
had
gained
the
bar
and
swore
perhaps
wisely
that
he
would
not
sacrifice
the
station
for
one
man
where
was
ray
where
was
ray
indeed
it
seemed
as
if
no
man
might
live
in
the
hellish
storm
that
raged
without
the
walls
as
if
the
very
impetus
of
hate
and
fury
would
carry
the
savages
over
the
stockade
to
murder
us
into
the
turmoil
at
the
gate
came
colonel
clark
sending
the
disputants
this
way
and
that
to
defend
the
fort
mcgary
to
command
one
quarter
harrod
and
bowman
another
and
every
man
that
could
be
found
to
a
loophole
while
ray
continued
to
run
up
and
down
wringing
her
hands
now
facing
one
man
now
another
some
of
her
words
came
to
me
shrilly
above
the
noise
he
fed
you
he
fed
you
oh
my
god
and
you
are
grateful
grateful
when
you
were
starving
he
risked
his
life
torn
by
anxiety
for
my
friend
i
dragged
myself
into
the
nearest
cabin
and
a
man
was
fighting
there
in
the
at
the
port
the
huge
figure
i
knew
to
be
my
friend
cowan
s
and
when
he
drew
back
to
load
i
seized
his
arm
shouting
ray
s
name
although
the
lead
was
pattering
on
the
other
side
of
the
logs
cowan
lifted
me
to
the
port
and
there
stretched
on
the
ground
behind
a
stump
within
twenty
feet
of
the
walls
was
james
even
as
i
looked
the
puffs
of
dust
at
his
side
showed
that
the
savages
knew
his
refuge
i
saw
him
level
and
fire
and
then
bill
cowan
set
me
down
and
began
to
ram
in
a
charge
with
tremendous
energy
was
there
no
way
to
save
ray
i
stood
turning
this
problem
in
my
mind
subconsciously
aware
of
cowan
s
movements
of
his
yells
when
he
thought
he
had

slipped
off
my
legging
and
bent
over
the
wound
her
eye
lighting
on
a
gourdful
of
water
on
the
puncheon
table
she
tore
a
strip
from
her
dress
and
washed
and
bound
me
deftly

bullet

in
the
flesh
and
gave
me
no
great
pain

i
for
i
had
heard
a
movement
in
an
instant
we
were
down
on
our
knees
on
the
hard
dirt
floor
and
there
was
a
man
s
foot
in
a
moccasin
we
both
grabbed
it
and
pulled
bringing
to
life
a
person
with
little
blue
eyes
and
stiff
blond
hair

polly

giving
him
an
involuntary
kick

to
a
sitting
position
and
clasped

knees
in
his
hands

fright

leaping
to
his
feet
i

once
stooping
down
he
searched
under
the
bed
pulled
out
his
rifle
powdered
the
pan
and
flying
to
the
other
port
fired
at
that
cowan
left
his
post
and
snatched
the
rifle
from
poulsson
s
hands
ye
re
but
wasting
powder
he
cried
angrily

by
tam
i

poulsson
vat

had

i
shouted
and
seizing
the
astonished
cowan
s
tomahawk
from
his
belt
i
set
to
work
furiously
chopping
at
the
dirt
beneath
the
log
wall
dig
so
that
james
can
get
cowan
gave
me
the
one
look
swore
a
mighty
oath
and
leaping
to
the
port
shouted
to
ray
in
a
thundering
voice
what
we
were
doing
dig
roared
cowan
dig
for
the
love
of
god
for
he
can
t
hear
the
three
of
us
set
to
work
with
all
our
might
poulsson
making
great
holes
in
the
ground
at
every
stroke
polly
ann
scraping
at
the
dirt
with
the
gourd
two
feet
below
the
surface
we
struck
the
edge
of
the
lowest
log
and
then
it
was
poulsson
who
got
into
the
hole
with
his
hunting
knife
perspiring
muttering
to
himself
working
as
one
possessed
with
a
fury
while
we
scraped
out
the
dirt
from
under
him
at
length
after
what
seemed
an
age
of
staring
at
his
legs
the
ground
caved
on
him
and
he
would
have
smothered
if
we
had
not
dragged
him
out
by
the
heels
sputtering
and
all
powdered
brown
but
there
was
the
daylight
under
the
log
again
cowan
shouted
at
ray
and
again
but
he
did
not
understand
it
was
then
the
miracle
happened
i
have
seen
brave
men
and
cowards
since
and
i
am
as
far
as
ever
from
distinguishing
them
before
we
knew
it
poulsson
was
in
the
hole
once
more
had
wriggled
out
of
it
on
the
other
side
and
was
squirming
in
a
hail
of
bullets
towards
ray
there
was
a
full
minute
of
suspense
perhaps
two
during
which
the
very
rifles
of
the
fort
were
silent
though
the
popping
in
the
weeds
was
redoubled
and
then
the
barrel
of
a
deckard
was
poked
through
the
hole
after
it
came
james
ray
himself
and
lastly
poulsson
and
a
great
shout
went
out
from
the
loopholes
and
was
taken
up
by
the
women
in
the
common
swein
poulsson
had
become
a
hero
nor
was
he
willing
to
lose
any
of
the
glamour
which
was
a
hero
s
right
as
the
indians
fire
slackened
he
went
from
cabin
to
cabin
and
if
its
occupants
failed
to
mention
the
exploit
some
did
fail
so
to
do
out
of
mischief
swein
would
say
you
did
not
see
me
safe
james
no
i
vill
tell
you
joost
it
never
leaked
out
that
swein
was
first
of
all
under
the
bed
for
polly
ann
and
bill
cowan
and
myself
swore
to
keep
the
secret
but
they
told
how
i
had
thought
of
digging
the
hole
under
the
logs
a
happy
circumstance
which
got
me
a
reputation
for
wisdom
beyond
my
years
there
was
a
certain
scotchman
at
harrodstown
called
mcandrew
and
it
was
he
gave
me
the
nickname
canny
davy
and
i
grew
to
have
a
sort
of
precocious
fame
in
the
station
often
captain
harrod
or
bowman
or
some
of
the
others
would
pause
in
their
arguments
and
say
gravely
what
does
davy
think
of
it
this
was
not
good
for
a
boy
and
the
wonder
of
it
is
that
it
did
not
make
me
altogether
insupportable
one
effect
it
had
on
me
to
make
me
long
even
more
earnestly
to
be
a
man
the
impulse
of
my
reputation
led
me
farther
a
fortnight
of
more
inactivity
followed
and
then
we
ventured
out
into
the
fields
once
more
but
i
went
with
the
guard
this
time
not
with
the
women
thanks
to
a
whim
the
men
had
for
humoring
me
arrah
and
beant
he
a
man
all
but
two
feet
said
terence
wid
more
brain
than
me
an
bill
cowan
and
poulsson
togither
tis
a
fox
s
nose
davy
has
for
the
divils
bill
sure
he
can
smell
thim
the
same
as
you
an
me
kin
see
the
red
paint
on
their
i
reckon
that
s
true
said
bill
cowan
with
solemnity
and
so
he
carried
me
off
at
length
the
cattle
were
turned
out
to
browse
greedily
through
the
clearing
while
we
lay
in
the
woods
by
the
forest
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
their
bells
but
when
they
strayed
too
far
i
was
often
sent
to
drive
them
back
once
when
this
happened
i
followed
them
to
the
shade
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
for
it
was
noon
and
the
sun
beat
down
fiercely
and
there
i
sat
for
some
time
watching
them
as
they
lashed
their
sides
with
their
tails
and
pawed
the
ground
for
experience
is
a
good
master
whether
or
not
the
flies
were
all
that
troubled
them
i
could
not
tell
and
no
sound
save
the
tinkle
of
their
bells
broke
the
noonday
stillness
making
a
circle
i
drove
them
back
toward
the
fort
much
troubled
in
mind
i
told
cowan
but
he
laughed
and
said
it
was
the
flies
yet
i
was
not
satisfied
and
finally
stole
back
again
to
the
place
where
i
had
found
them
i
sat
a
long
time
hidden
at
the
edge
of
the
forest
listening
until
my
imagination
tricked
me
into
hearing
those
noises
which
i
feared
and
yet
longed
for
trembling
i
stole
a
little
farther
in
the
shade
of
the
woods
and
then
a
little
farther
still
the
leaves
rustled
in
the
summer
s
breeze
patches
of
sunlight
flickered
on
the
mould
the
birds
twittered
and
the
squirrels
scolded
a
chipmunk
frightened
me
as
he
flew
chattering
along
a
log
and
yet
i
went
on
i
came
to
the
creek
as
it
flowed
silently
in
the
shade
stepped
in
and
made
my
way
slowly
down
it
i
know
not
how
far
walking
in
the
water
my
eye
alert
to
every
movement
about
me
at
length
i
stopped
and
caught
my
breath
before
me
in
a
glade
opening
out
under
great
trees
what
seemed
a
myriad
of
forked
sticks
were
piled
against
one
another
three
by
three
and
it
struck
me
all
in
a
heap
that
i
had
come
upon
a
great
encampment
but
the
skeletons
of
the
pyramid
tents
alone
remained
where
were
the
skins
was
the
camp
deserted
for
a
while
i
stared
through
the
brier
leaves
then
i
took
a
venture
pushed
on
and
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
the
place
it
must
have
held
near
a
thousand
warriors
all
about
me
were
gray
heaps
of
ashes
and
bones
of
deer
and
elk
and
buffalo
scattered
some
picked
clean
some
with
the
meat
and
hide
sticking
to
them
impelled
by
a
strong
fascination
i
went
hither
and
thither
until
a
sound
brought
me
to
a
stand
the
echoing
crack
of
a
distant
rifle
on
the
heels
of
it
came
another
then
several
together
and
a
faint
shouting
borne
on
the
light
wind
terrorized
i
sought
for
shelter
a
pile
of
brush
underlain
by
ashes
was
by
and
i
crept
into
that
the
sounds
continued
but
seemed
to
come
no
nearer
and
my
courage
returning
i
got
out
again
and
ran
wildly
through
the
camp
toward
the
briers
on
the
creek
expecting
every
moment
to
be
tumbled
headlong
by
a
bullet
and
when
i
reached
the
briers
what
between
panting
and
the
thumping
of
my
heart
i
could
for
a
few
moments
hear
nothing
then
i
ran
on
again
up
the
creek
heedless
of
cover
stumbling
over
logs
and
trailing
vines
when
all
at
once
a
dozen
bronze
forms
glided
with
the
speed
of
deer
across
my
path
ahead
they
splashed
over
the
creek
and
were
gone
bewildered
with
fear
i
dropped
under
a
fallen
tree
shouts
were
in
my
ears
and
the
noise
of
men
running
i
stood
up
and
there
not
twenty
paces
away
was
colonel
clark
himself
rushing
toward
me
he
halted
with
a
cry
raised
his
rifle
and
dropped
it
at
the
sight
of
my
queer
little
figure
covered
with
ashes
my
god
he
cried
it
s
they
crossed
the
creek
i
shouted
pointing
the
way
they
crossed
the
creek
some
twelve
of
ay
he
said
staring
at
me
and
by
this
time
the
rest
of
the
guard
were
come
up
they
too
stared
with
different
exclamations
on
their
lips
cowan
and
bowman
and
tom
mcchesney
and
terence
mccann
in
front
and
there
s
a
great
camp
below
i
went
on
deserted
where
a
thousand
men
have
a
camp
deserted
said
clark
quickly
yes
i
said
but
he
had
already
started
forward
and
seized
me
by
the
arm
lead
on
he
cried
show
it
to
he
went
ahead
with
me
travelling
so
fast
that
i
must
needs
run
to
keep
up
and
fairly
lifting
me
over
the
logs
but
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
place
he
darted
forward
alone
and
went
through
it
like
a
hound
on
the
trail
the
others
followed
him
crying
out
at
the
size
of
the
place
and
poking
among
the
ashes
at
length
they
all
took
up
the
trail
for
a
way
down
the
creek
presently
clark
called
a
halt
i
reckon
that
they
ve
made
for
the
ohio
he
said
and
at
this
judgment
from
him
the
guard
gave
a
cheer
that
might
almost
have
been
heard
in
the
fields
around
the
fort
the
terror
that
had
hovered
over
us
all
that
long
summer
was
lifted
at
last
you
may
be
sure
that
cowan
carried
me
back
to
the
station
to
think
it
was
davy
that
found
it
he
cried
again
and
again
to
think
it
was
davy
found
it
and
wasn
t
it
me
that
said
he
could
smell
the
divils
said
terence
as
he
circled
around
us
in
a
mimic
war
dance
and
when
from
the
fort
they
saw
us
coming
across
the
fields
they
opened
the
gates
in
astonishment
and
on
hearing
the
news
gave
themselves
over
to
the
wildest
rejoicing
for
the
backwoodsmen
were
children
of
nature
bill
cowan
ran
for
the
fiddle
which
he
had
carried
so
carefully
over
the
mountain
and
that
night
we
had
jigs
and
reels
on
the
common
while
the
big
fellow
played
billy
of
the
wild
woods
and
jump
juba
with
all
his
might
and
the
pine
knots
threw
their
fitful
red
light
on
the
wild
scenes
of
merriment
i
must
have
cut
a
queer
little
figure
as
i
sat
between
cowan
and
tom
watching
the
dance
for
presently
colonel
clark
came
up
to
us
laughing
in
his
quiet
way
davy
said
he
there
is
another
great
man
here
who
would
like
to
see
you
and
led
me
away
wondering
i
went
with
him
toward
the
gate
burning
all
over
with
pride
at
this
attention
and
beside
a
torch
there
a
figure
was
standing
at
sight
of
whom
i
had
a
start
of
remembrance
do
you
know
who
that
is
davy
said
colonel
clark
it
s
daniel
boone
said
i
by
thunder
said
clark
i
believe
the
boy
is
a
wizard
while
boone
s
broad
mouth
was
creased
into
a
smile
and
there
was
a
trace
of
astonishment
too
in
his
kindly
eye
mr
boone
came
to
my
father
s
cabin
on
the
yadkin
once
i
said
he
taught
me
to
skin
a
ay
that
i
did
exclaimed
boone
and
i
said
ye
d
make
a
woodsman
boone
it
seemed
had
come
over
from
boonesboro
to
consult
with
colonel
clark
on
certain
matters
and
had
but
just
arrived
but
so
modest
was
he
that
he
would
not
let
it
be
known
that
he
was
in
the
station
for
fear
of
interrupting
the
pleasure
he
was
much
the
same
as
i
had
known
him
only
grown
older
and
his
reputation
now
increased
to
vastness
he
and
clark
sat
on
a
door
log
talking
for
a
long
time
on
kentucky
matters
the
strength
of
the
forts
the
prospect
of
new
settlers
that
autumn
of
the
british
policy
and
finally
of
a
journey
which
colonel
clark
was
soon
to
make
back
to
virginia
across
the
mountains
they
seemed
not
to
mind
my
presence
at
length
colonel
clark
turned
to
me
with
that
quiet
jocose
way
he
had
when
relaxed
davy
said
he
we
ll
see
how
much
of
a
general
you
are
what
would
you
do
if
a
scoundrel
named
hamilton
far
away
at
detroit
was
bribing
all
the
redskins
he
could
find
north
of
the
ohio
to
come
down
and
scalp
your
men
i
d
go
for
hamilton
i
answered
by
god
exclaimed
clark
striking
boone
on
the
knee
that
s
what
i
d
chapter
xi
fragmentary
boone
s
visit
lasted
but
a
day
i
was
a
great
deal
with
colonel
clark
in
the
few
weeks
that
followed
before
his
departure
for
virginia
he
held
himself
a
little
aloof
as
a
leader
should
from
the
captains
in
the
station
without
seeming
to
offend
them
but
he
had
a
fancy
for
james
ray
and
for
me
and
he
often
took
me
into
the
woods
with
him
by
day
and
talked
with
me
of
an
evening
i
m
going
away
to
virginia
davy
he
said
will
you
not
go
with
me
we
ll
see
williamsburg
and
come
back
in
the
spring
and
i
ll
have
you
a
little
rifle
my
look
must
have
been
wistful
i
can
t
leave
polly
ann
and
tom
i
answered
well
he
said
i
like
that
faith
to
your
friends
is
a
big
equipment
for
but
why
are
you
going
i
asked
because
i
love
kentucky
best
of
all
things
in
the
world
he
answered
smiling
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
insisted
ah
he
said
that
i
can
t
tell
even
to
to
catch
hamilton
i
ventured
at
random
he
looked
at
me
queerly
would
you
go
along
davy
said
he
laughing
now
would
you
take
tom
among
the
first
answered
colonel
clark
heartily
we
were
seated
under
the
elm
near
the
spring
and
at
that
instant
i
saw
tom
coming
toward
us
i
jumped
up
thinking
to
please
him
by
this
intelligence
when
colonel
clark
pulled
me
down
again
davy
said
he
almost
roughly
i
thought
remember
that
we
have
been
joking
do
you
understand
joking
you
have
a
tongue
in
your
mouth
but
sense
enough
in
your
head
i
believe
to
hold
he
turned
to
tom
mcchesney
this
is
a
queer
lad
you
brought
us
said
he
he
s
a
little
deevil
agreed
tom
for
that
had
become
a
formula
with
him
it
was
all
very
mysterious
to
me
and
i
lay
awake
many
a
night
with
curiosity
trying
to
solve
a
puzzle
that
was
none
of
my
business
and
one
day
to
cap
the
matter
two
woodsmen
arrived
at
harrodstown
with
clothes
frayed
and
bodies
lean
from
a
long
journey
not
one
of
the
hundred
questions
with
which
they
were
beset
would
they
answer
nor
say
where
they
had
been
or
why
save
that
they
had
carried
out
certain
orders
of
clark
who
was
locked
up
with
them
in
a
cabin
for
several
hours
the
first
of
october
the
day
of
colonel
clark
s
departure
dawned
crisp
and
clear
he
was
to
take
with
him
the
disheartened
and
the
cowed
the
weaklings
who
loved
neither
work
nor
exposure
nor
danger
and
before
he
set
out
of
the
gate
he
made
a
little
speech
to
the
assembled
people
my
friends
he
said
you
know
me
i
put
the
interests
of
kentucky
before
my
own
last
year
when
i
left
to
represent
her
at
williamsburg
there
were
some
who
said
i
would
desert
her
it
was
for
her
sake
i
made
that
journey
suffered
the
tortures
of
hell
from
scalded
feet
was
near
to
dying
in
the
mountains
it
was
for
her
sake
that
i
importuned
the
governor
and
council
for
powder
and
lead
and
when
they
refused
it
i
said
to
them
gentlemen
a
country
that
is
not
worth
defending
is
not
worth
at
these
words
the
settlers
gave
a
great
shout
waving
their
coonskin
hats
in
the
air
ay
that
ye
did
cried
bill
cowan
and
got
the
i
made
that
journey
for
her
sake
i
say
colonel
clark
continued
and
even
so
i
am
making
this
one
i
pray
you
trust
me
and
god
bless
and
keep
you
while
i
am
he
did
not
forget
to
speak
to
me
as
he
walked
between
our
lines
and
told
me
to
be
a
good
boy
and
that
he
would
see
me
in
the
spring
some
of
the
women
shed
tears
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
and
many
of
us
climbed
to
sentry
box
and
cabin
roof
that
we
might
see
the
last
of
the
little
company
wending
its
way
across
the
fields
a
motley
company
it
was
the
refuse
of
the
station
headed
by
its
cherished
captain
so
they
started
back
over
the
weary
road
that
led
to
that
now
land
of
civilization
and
safety
during
the
balmy
indian
summer
when
the
sharper
lines
of
nature
are
softened
by
the
haze
some
came
to
us
from
across
the
mountains
to
make
up
for
the
deserters
from
time
to
time
a
little
group
would
straggle
to
the
gates
of
the
station
weary
and
footsore
but
overjoyed
at
the
sight
of
white
faces
again
the
fathers
walking
ahead
with
watchful
eyes
the
women
and
older
children
driving
the
horses
and
the
babies
slung
to
the
pack
in
hickory
withes
nay
some
of
our
best
citizens
came
to
kentucky
swinging
to
the
tail
of
a
patient
animal
the
indians
were
still
abroad
and
in
small
war
parties
darted
hither
and
thither
with
incredible
swiftness
and
at
night
we
would
gather
at
the
fire
around
our
new
emigrants
to
listen
to
the
stories
they
had
to
tell
familiar
stories
to
all
of
us
sometimes
it
had
been
the
gobble
of
a
wild
turkey
that
had
lured
to
danger
again
a
had
cried
strangely
in
the
night
winter
came
and
passed
somehow
i
can
not
dwell
here
on
the
tediousness
of
it
and
the
one
bright
spot
it
has
left
in
my
memory
concerns
polly
ann
did
man
woman
or
child
fall
sick
it
was
polly
ann
who
nursed
them
she
had
by
nature
the
gift
of
healing
knew
by
heart
all
the
simple
remedies
that
backwoods
lore
had
inherited
from
the
north
of
ireland
or
borrowed
from
the
indians
her
sympathy
and
did
more
than
these
her
never
tiring
and
ever
cheerful
watchfulness
she
was
deft
too
was
polly
ann
and
spun
from
nettle
bark
many
a
cut
of
linen
that
could
scarce
be
told
from
flax
before
the
sap
began
to
run
again
in
the
maples
there
was
not
a
soul
in
harrodstown
who
did
not
love
her
and
i
truly
believe
that
most
of
them
would
have
risked
their
lives
to
do
her
bidding
then
came
the
sugaring
the
warm
days
and
the
freezing
nights
when
the
earth
stirs
in
her
sleep
and
the
taps
drip
from
red
sunrise
to
red
sunset
old
and
young
went
to
the
camps
the
women
and
children
boiling
and
graining
the
squads
of
men
posted
in
guards
round
about
and
after
that
the
days
flew
so
quickly
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
woods
had
burst
suddenly
into
white
flower
and
it
was
spring
again
and
then
a
joy
to
be
long
remembered
i
went
on
a
hunting
trip
with
tom
and
cowan
and
three
others
where
the
kentucky
tumbles
between
its
darkly
wooded
cliffs
and
other
wonders
of
that
strange
land
i
saw
then
for
the
first
time
great
licks
trampled
down
for
acres
by
the
wild
herds
where
the
salt
water
oozes
out
of
the
hoofprints
on
the
edge
of
one
of
these
licks
we
paused
and
stared
breathless
at
giant
bones
sticking
here
and
there
in
the
black
mud
and
great
skulls
of
fearful
beasts
this
was
called
the
big
bone
lick
and
some
travellers
that
went
before
us
had
made
their
tents
with
the
thighs
of
these
monsters
of
a
past
age
a
danger
past
is
oft
a
danger
forgotten
men
went
out
to
build
the
homes
of
which
they
had
dreamed
through
the
long
winter
axes
rang
amidst
the
white
dogwoods
and
the
crabs
and
redbuds
and
there
were
riotous
in
the
clearings
but
i
think
the
building
of
tom
s
house
was
the
most
joyous
occasion
of
all
and
for
none
in
the
settlement
would
men
work
more
willingly
than
for
him
and
polly
ann
the
cabin
went
up
as
if
by
magic
it
stood
on
a
rise
upon
the
bank
of
the
river
in
a
grove
of
oaks
and
hickories
with
a
big
persimmon
tree
in
front
of
the
door
it
was
in
the
shade
of
this
tree
that
polly
ann
sat
watching
tom
and
me
through
the
mild
spring
days
as
we
barked
the
roof
and
none
ever
felt
greater
joy
and
pride
in
a
home
than
she
we
had
our
first
supper
on
a
wide
puncheon
under
the
persimmon
tree
on
the
few
pewter
plates
we
had
fetched
across
the
mountain
the
blue
smoke
from
our
own
hearth
rising
in
the
valley
until
the
cold
night
air
spread
it
out
in
a
line
above
us
while
the
horses
grazed
at
the
river
s
edge
after
that
we
went
to
ploughing
an
occupation
which
tom
fancied
but
little
for
he
loved
the
life
of
a
hunter
best
of
all
but
there
was
corn
to
be
raised
and
fodder
for
the
horses
and
a
to
be
cleared
near
the
house
one
day
a
great
event
happened
and
after
the
manner
of
many
great
events
it
began
in
mystery
leaping
on
the
roan
mare
i
was
riding
like
mad
for
harrodstown
to
fetch
cowan
and
she
when
she
heard
the
summons
abandoned
a
turkey
on
the
spit
pitched
her
brats
out
of
the
door
seized
the
mare
and
dashing
through
the
gates
at
a
gallop
left
me
to
make
my
way
back
afoot
scenting
a
sensation
i
hurried
along
the
wooded
trace
at
a
dog
trot
and
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
cabin
there
was
cowan
sitting
on
the
step
holding
in
her
long
but
motherly
arms
something
bundled
up
in
nettle
linen
while
tom
stood
sheepishly
by
staring
at
it
shucks
cowan
was
saying
loudly
i
reckon
ye
re
as
little
use
as
swein
poulsson
standin
there
on
one
foot
ye
anger
me
just
grinning
at
it
like
a
fool
and
yer
own
doin
have
ye
forgot
how
to
talk
tom
grinned
the
more
but
was
saved
the
effort
of
a
reply
by
a
loud
noise
from
the
bundle
here
s
another
cried
cowan
to
me
ye
needn
t
act
as
if
it
was
an
animal
faith
yereself
was
like
that
once
all
red
an
crinkled
but
i
warrant
ye
didn
t
have
the
heft
and
she
lifted
it
judicially
a
grand
baby
attacking
tom
again
and
ye
re
no
more
worthy
to
be
his
father
than
davy
then
i
heard
a
voice
calling
me
and
pushing
past
cowan
i
ran
into
the
cabin
polly
ann
lay
on
the
log
bedstead
and
she
turned
to
mine
a
face
radiant
with
a
happiness
i
had
not
imagined
oh
davy
have
ye
seen
him
have
ye
seen
little
tom
davy
i
reckon
i
ll
never
be
so
happy
again
fetch
him
here
cowan
with
a
glance
of
contempt
at
tom
and
me
put
the
bundle
tenderly
down
on
the
coarse
brown
sheet
beside
her
poor
little
tom
only
the
first
fortnight
of
his
existence
was
spent
in
peace
i
have
a
pathetic
memory
of
it
all
of
our
little
home
of
our
hopes
for
it
of
our
days
of
labor
and
nights
of
planning
to
make
it
complete
and
then
one
morning
when
the
three
of
us
were
turning
over
the
black
loam
in
the
patch
while
the
baby
slept
peacefully
in
the
shade
a
sound
came
to
our
ears
that
made
us
pause
and
listen
with
bated
breath
it
was
the
sound
of
many
guns
muffled
in
the
distant
forest
with
a
cry
polly
ann
flew
to
the
hickory
cradle
under
the
tree
tom
sprang
for
the
rifle
that
was
never
far
from
his
side
while
with
a
kind
of
instinct
i
ran
to
catch
the
spancelled
horses
by
the
river
in
silence
and
sorrow
we
fled
through
the
tall
cane
nor
dared
to
take
one
last
look
at
the
cabin
or
the
fields
lying
black
in
the
spring
sunlight
the
shots
had
ceased
but
ere
we
had
reached
the
little
clearing
mccann
had
made
they
began
again
though
as
distant
as
before
tom
went
ahead
while
i
led
the
mare
and
polly
ann
clutched
the
child
to
her
breast
but
when
we
came
in
sight
of
the
fort
across
the
clearings
the
gates
were
closed
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
cower
in
the
thicket
listening
while
the
battle
went
on
afar
polly
ann
trying
to
still
the
cries
of
the
child
lest
they
should
bring
death
upon
us
at
length
the
shooting
ceased
stillness
reigned
then
came
a
faint
halloo
and
out
of
the
forest
beyond
us
a
man
rode
waving
his
hat
at
the
fort
after
him
came
others
the
gates
opened
and
we
rushed
across
the
fields
to
safety
the
indians
had
shot
at
a
party
shelling
corn
at
captain
bowman
s
plantation
and
killed
two
while
the
others
had
taken
refuge
in
the
crib
fired
at
from
every
brake
james
ray
had
ridden
to
harrodstown
for
succor
and
the
savages
had
been
beaten
off
but
only
the
foolhardy
returned
to
their
clearings
now
we
were
on
the
edge
of
another
dreaded
summer
of
siege
the
prospect
of
banishment
from
the
homes
we
could
almost
see
staring
us
in
the
face
and
the
labors
of
the
spring
lost
again
there
was
bitter
talk
within
the
gates
that
night
and
many
declared
angrily
that
colonel
clark
had
abandoned
us
but
i
remembered
what
he
had
said
and
had
faith
in
him
it
was
that
very
night
too
i
sat
with
cowan
who
had
duty
in
one
of
the
sentry
boxes
and
we
heard
a
voice
calling
softly
under
us
fearing
treachery
cowan
cried
out
for
a
sign
then
the
answer
came
back
loudly
to
open
to
a
runner
with
a
message
from
colonel
clark
to
captain
harrod
cowan
let
the
man
in
while
i
ran
for
the
captain
and
in
five
minutes
it
seemed
as
if
every
man
and
woman
and
child
in
the
fort
were
awake
and
crowding
around
the
man
by
the
gates
their
eager
faces
reddened
by
the
smoking
pine
knots
where
was
clark
what
had
he
been
doing
had
he
deserted
them
deserted
ye
cried
the
runner
and
swore
a
great
oath
wasn
t
clark
even
then
on
the
ohio
raising
a
great
army
with
authority
from
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
to
rid
them
of
the
red
scourge
and
would
they
desert
him
or
would
they
be
men
and
bring
from
harrodstown
the
company
he
asked
for
then
captain
harrod
read
the
letter
asking
him
to
raise
the
company
and
before
day
had
dawned
they
were
ready
for
the
word
to
march
ready
to
leave
cabin
and
clearing
and
wife
and
child
trusting
in
clark
s
judgment
for
time
and
place
never
were
volunteers
mustered
more
quickly
than
in
that
cool
april
night
by
the
gates
of
harrodstown
station
and
we
ll
fetch
davy
along
for
luck
cried
cowan
catching
sight
of
me
beside
him
sure
we
ll
be
wanting
a
dhrummer
b
y
said
mccann
and
so
they
enrolled
me
chapter
xii
the
campaign
begins
davy
take
care
of
my
tom
cried
polly
ann
i
can
see
her
now
standing
among
the
women
by
the
great
hewn
gateposts
with
little
tom
in
her
arms
holding
him
out
to
us
as
we
filed
by
and
the
vision
of
his
little
round
face
haunted
tom
and
me
for
many
weary
miles
of
our
tramp
through
the
wilderness
i
have
often
thought
since
that
that
march
of
the
volunteer
company
to
join
clark
at
the
falls
of
the
ohio
was
a
superb
example
of
confidence
in
one
man
and
scarce
to
be
equalled
in
history
in
less
than
a
week
we
of
captain
harrod
s
little
company
stood
on
a
bank
gazing
spellbound
at
the
troubled
waters
of
a
mighty
river
that
river
was
the
ohio
and
it
divided
us
from
the
strange
north
country
whence
the
savages
came
from
below
the
angry
voice
of
the
great
falls
cried
out
to
us
unceasingly
smoke
rose
through
the
of
the
island
opposite
and
through
the
new
gaps
of
its
forest
cabins
could
be
seen
and
presently
at
a
signal
from
us
a
big
flatboat
left
its
shore
swung
out
and
circled
on
the
polished
current
and
grounded
at
length
in
the
mud
below
us
a
dozen
tall
boatmen
dropped
the
big
oars
and
leaped
out
on
the
bank
with
a
yell
of
greeting
at
the
head
of
them
was
a
man
of
huge
frame
and
long
light
hair
falling
down
over
the
collar
of
his
hunting
shirt
he
wrung
captain
harrod
s
hand
that
there
s
simon
kenton
davy
said
cowan
as
we
stood
watching
them
i
ran
forward
for
a
better
look
at
the
backwoods
hercules
the
tales
of
whose
prowess
had
helped
to
while
away
many
a
winter
s
night
in
harrodstown
station
and
stern
yet
he
had
the
kindly
eye
of
the
most
indomitable
of
frontier
fighters
and
i
doubted
not
the
truth
of
what
was
said
of
him
that
he
could
kill
any
redskin
clark
s
thar
he
was
saying
to
captain
harrod
god
knows
what
his
pluck
is
he
ain
t
said
a
he
doesn
t
say
whar
he
s
going
said
harrod
not
a
notion
answered
kenton
he
s
the
greatest
man
to
keep
his
mouth
shut
i
ever
saw
he
kept
at
the
governor
of
virginny
till
he
gave
him
twelve
hundred
pounds
in
continentals
and
power
to
raise
troops
then
clark
fetched
a
circle
for
fort
pitt
raised
some
troops
thar
and
in
virginny
and
some
about
red
stone
and
come
down
the
ohio
here
with
em
in
a
lot
of
flatboats
now
that
ye
ve
got
here
the
kentucky
boys
is
all
in
i
come
over
with
montgomery
and
dillard
s
here
from
the
holston
country
with
a
well
said
captain
harrod
i
reckon
we
ll
i
went
among
the
first
and
as
the
men
strained
against
the
current
kenton
explained
that
colonel
clark
had
brought
a
number
of
emigrants
down
the
river
with
him
that
he
purposed
to
leave
them
on
this
island
with
a
little
force
that
they
might
raise

terence
mccann

in
the
bow
and
indeed
i
could
pick
out
the
familiar
figure
among
the
hundred
frontiersmen
that
gathered
among
the
stumps
at
the
as
our
keel
scraped
they
gave
a
shout
that
rattled
in
the
forest
behind
them
and
clark
came
down
to
the
waterside
i
knew
that
harrodstown
wouldn
t
fail
me
he
said
and
called
every
man
by
name
as
we
waded
ashore
when
i
came
splashing
along
after
tom
he
pulled
me
from
the
water
with
his
two
hands

terence

cowan
and
the
men
laughed

hundred
miles
without

davy
asked
colonel
clark
eying
me
gravely

s
lean
as
a
wolf
and
no
stomach
to
hinder
him
said
terence
seeing
me
look
troubled
i
ll
not
be
missing
the
bit
of
food
the
likes
of
him
would
and
as
for
the
heft
of
him
added
cowan
mac
and
i
ll
not

colonel
clark
laughed
well
boys
he
said
if
you
must
have
him
you
must
his
excellency
gave
me
no
instructions
about
a
drummer
but
we
ll
take
you
in
those
days
he
was
a
man
that
wasted
no
time
was
colonel
clark
and
within
the
hour
our
little
detachment
had
joined
the
others
felling
trees
and
shaping
the
for
the
cabins
that
night
as
tom
and
cowan
and
mccann
and
james
ray
lay
around
their
fire
taking
a
rest
a
man
broke
excitedly
into
the
light
with
a
object
balanced
on
his
head
which
he
set
down
in
front
of
us
the
man
proved
to
be
swein
poulsson
and
the
object
a
big
drum
and
he
straightway
began
to
beat
upon
it
a
tattoo
with
improvised
drumsticks
a
red
stone
man
he
cried
a
red
stone
man
he
have
it
in
the
flatboat
it
is
for
the
saints
be
good
to
us
said
terence
if
it
isn
t
the
king
s
own
drum
he
and
sure
enough
on
the
head
of
it
gleamed
the
royal
arms
of
england
and
on
the
other
side
as
we
turned
it
over
the
device
of
a
regiment
they
flung
the
sling
about
my
neck
and
the
next
day
when
the
little
army
drew
up
for
parade
among
the
stumps
there
i
was
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
prouder
than
any
man
in
the
ranks
and
colonel
clark
coming
to
my
end
of
the
line
paused
and
smiled
and
patted
me
kindly
on
the
cheek
have
you
put
this
man
on
the
roll
harrod
says
he
no
colonel
answers
captain
harrod
amid
the
laughter
of
the
men
at
my
end
what
says
the
colonel
what
an
oversight
from
this
day
he
is
drummer
boy
and
orderly
to
the
beat
the
retreat
my
i
did
my
best
and
as
the
men
broke
ranks
they
crowded
around
me
laughing
and
joking
and
cowan
picked
me
up
drum
and
all
and
carried
me
off
i
rapping
furiously
the
while
and
so
i
became
a
kind
of
handy
boy
for
the
whole
regiment
from
the
colonel
down
for
i
was
willing
and
glad
to
work
i
cooked
the
colonel
s
meals
roasting
the
turkey
breasts
and
saddles
of
venison
that
the
hunters
brought
in
from
the
mainland
and
even
made
him
a
trick
which
polly
ann
had
taught
me
and
when
i
went
about
the
island
if
a
man
were
loafing
he
would
seize
his
axe
and
cry
here
s
davy
he
ll
tell
the
colonel
on
thanks
to
the
jokes
of
terence
mccann
i
gained
an
reputation
for
wisdom
amongst
these
superstitious
backwoodsmen
and
they
came
verily
to
believe
that
upon
my
existence
depended
the
success
of
the
campaign
but
day
after
day
passed
and
no
sign
from
colonel
clark
of
his
intentions
there
s
a
good
lad
said
terence
he
ll
be
telling
us
where
we
re
i
was
asked
the
same
question
by
a
score
or
more
but
colonel
clark
kept
his
own
counsel
he
himself
was
everywhere
during
the
days
that
followed
superintending
the
work
on
the
blockhouse
we
were
building
and
eying
the
men
rumor
had
it
that
he
was
sorting
out
the
sheep
from
the
goats
silently
choosing
those
who
were
to
remain
on
the
island
and
those
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
campaign
at
length
the
blockhouse
stood
finished
amid
the
yellow
stumps
of
the
great
trees
the
trunks
of
which
were
in
its
walls
and
suddenly
the
order
went
forth
for
the
men
to
draw
up
in
front
of
it
by
companies
with
the
families
of
the
emigrants
behind
them
it
was
a
picture
to
fix
itself
in
a
boy
s
mind
and
one
that
i
have
never
forgotten
the
line
of
backwoodsmen
as
fine
a
lot
of
men
as
i
ever
wish
to
see
bronzed
by
the
june
sun
strong
and
tireless
as
the
wild
animals
of
the
forest
stood
expectant
with
rifles
grounded
and
beside
the
tallest
at
the
end
of
the
line
was
a
diminutive
figure
with
a
drum
hung
in
front
of
it
the
early
summer
wind
rustled
in
the
forest
and
the
never
ending
song
of
the
great
falls
sounded
from
afar
apart
and
indomitable
stood
a
young
man
of
my
friends
and
neighbors
he
said
in
a
firm
voice
there
is
scarce
a
man
standing
among
you
who
has
not
suffered
at
the
hands
of
savages
some
of
you
have
seen
wives
and
children
killed
before
your
eyes
or
dragged
into
captivity
none
of
you
can
call
the
home
for
which
he
has
risked
so
much
his
own
and
who
i
ask
you
is
to
blame
for
this
hideous
war
whose
gold
is
it
that
buys
guns
and
powder
and
lead
to
send
the
shawnee
and
the
iroquois
and
algonquin
on
the
warpath
he
paused
and
a
hoarse
murmur
of
anger
ran
along
the
ranks
whose
gold
but
george
s
by
the
grace
of
god
king
of
great
britain
and
ireland
and
what
minions
distribute
it
abbott
at
kaskaskia
for
one
and
hamilton
at
detroit
the
hair
buyer
for
another
when
he
spoke
hamilton
s
name
his
voice
was
nearly
drowned
by
imprecations
silence
cried
clark
sternly
and
they
were
silent
my
friends
the
best
way
for
a
man
to
defend
himself
is
to
maim
his
enemy
one
year
since
when
you
did
me
the
honor
to
choose
me
of
your
militia
in
kentucky
i
sent
two
scouts
to
kaskaskia
a
dozen
years
ago
the
french
owned
that
place
and
vincent
and
detroit
and
the
people
there
are
still
french
my
men
brought
back
word
that
the
french
feared
the
long
knives
as
the
indians
call
us
on
the
first
of
october
i
went
to
virginia
and
some
of
you
thought
again
that
i
had
deserted
you
i
went
to
williamsburg
and
wrestled
with
governor
patrick
henry
and
his
council
with
jefferson
and
mason
and
wythe
virginia
had
no
troops
to
send
us
and
her
men
were
fighting
barefoot
with
washington
against
the
armies
of
the
british
king
but
the
governor
gave
me
twelve
hundred
pounds
in
paper
and
with
it
i
have
raised
the
little
force
that
we
have
here
and
with
it
we
will
carry
the
war
into
hamilton
s
country
on
the
swift
waters
of
this
great
river
which
flows
past
us
have
come
tidings
and
god
himself
has
sent
them
would
have
been
too
late
the
ships
and
armies
of
the
french
king
are
on
their
way
across
the
ocean
to
help
us
fight
the
tyrant
and
this
is
the
news
that
we
bear
to
the
kaskaskias
when
they
hear
this
the
french
of
those
towns
will
not
fight
against
us
my
friends
we
are
going
to
conquer
an
empire
for
liberty
and
i
can
look
onward
he
cried
in
a
burst
of
inspired
eloquence
sweeping
his
arm
to
the
northward
toward
the
forests
on
the
far
side
of
the
ohio
i
can
look
onward
to
the
day
when
these
lands
will
be
filled
with
the
cities
of
a
great
republic
and
who
among
you
will
falter
at
such
a
call
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
then
a
shout
went
up
from
the
ranks
that
drowned
the
noise
of
the
falls
and
many
fell
into
antics
some
throwing
their
coonskin
hats
in
the
air
and
others
cursing
and
scalping
hamilton
in
mockery
while
i
pounded
on
the
drum
with
all
my
might
but
when
we
had
broken
ranks
the
rumor
was
whispered
about
that
the
holston
company
had
not
cheered
and
indeed
the
rest
of
the
day
these
men
went
about
plainly
morose
and
discontented
some
saying
openly
and
with
much
justice
though
we
failed
to
see
it
then
that
they
had
their
own
families
and
settlements
to
defend
from
the
southern
indians
and
chickamauga
bandits
and
could
not
undertake
kentucky
s
fight
at
that
time
and
when
the
enthusiasm
had
burned
away
a
little
the
disaffection
spread
and
some
even
of
the
kentuckians
began
to
murmur
against
clark
for
faith
or
genius
was
needful
to
inspire
men
to
his
plan
one
of
the
malcontents
from
boonesboro
came
to
our
fire
to
argue
he
s
mad
as
a
medicine
man
is
clark
to
go
into
that
country
with
less
than
two
hundred
rifles
and
he
ll
force
us
will
he
i
d
as
lief
have
the
king
for
a
he
brought
every
man
in
our
circle
to
his
feet
ray
mccann
cowan
and
tom
but
tom
was
nearest
and
words
not
coming
easily
to
him
he
fell
on
the
boonesboro
man
instead
and
they
fought
it
out
for
ten
minutes
in
the
firelight
with
half
the
regiment
around
them
at
the
end
of
it
when
the
malcontents
were
carrying
their
champion
away
they
were
stopped
suddenly
at
the
sight
of
one
bursting
through
the
circle
into
the
light
and
a
hush
fell
upon
the
quarrel
it
was
colonel
clark
are
you
hurt
mcchesney
he
demanded
i
reckon
not
much
colonel
said
tom
grinning
as
he
wiped
his
face
if
any
man
deserts
this
camp
cried
colonel
clark
swinging
around
i
swear
by
god
to
have
him
chased
and
brought
back
and
punished
as
he
deserves
captain
harrod
set
a
i
pass
quickly
over
the
rest
of
the
incident
how
the
holston
men
and
some
others
escaped
in
the
night
in
spite
of
our
guard
and
swam
the
river
on
logs
how
at
dawn
we
found
them
gone
and
kenton
and
harrod
and
brave
captain
montgomery
set
out
in
pursuit
with
cowan
and
tom
and
ray
all
day
they
rode
relentless
and
the
next
evening
returned
with
but
eight
weary
and
sullen
fugitives
of
all
those
who
had
deserted
the
next
day
the
sun
rose
on
a
smiling
world
the
polished
reaches
of
the
river
golden
mirrors
reflecting
the
forest
s
green
and
we
were
astir
with
the
light
preparing
for
our
journey
into
the
unknown
country
at
seven
we
embarked
by
companies
in
the
flatboats
waving
a
farewell
to
those
who
were
to
be
left
behind
some
stayed
through
inclination
and
disaffection
others
because
colonel
clark
did
not
deem
them
equal
to
the
task
but
swein
poulsson
came
with
tears
in
his
little
blue
eyes
he
had
begged
the
colonel
to
take
him
and
i
remember
him
well
on
that
june
morning
his
red
face
perspiring
under
the
white
bristles
of
his
hair
as
he
strained
at
the
big
oar
for
we
must
needs
pull
a
mile
up
the
stream
ere
we
could
reach
the
passage
in
which
to
shoot
downward
to
the
falls
suddenly
poulsson
dropped
his
handle
causing
the
boat
to
swing
round
in
the
stream
while
the
men
damned
him
paying
them
no
attention
he
stood
pointing
into
the
blinding
disk
of
the
sun
across
the
edge
of
it
a
piece
was
bitten
out
in
blackness
mein
gott
he
cried
the
world
is
being
ended
just
the
holy
saints
remember
us
this
day
said
mccann
missing
a
stroke
to
cross
himself
will
ye
pull
ye
damned
dutchman
or
we
ll
be
the
first
to
slide
into
hell
this
is
no
kind
of
a
place
at
all
at
by
this
time
the
men
all
along
the
line
of
boats
had
seen
it
and
many
faltered
clark
s
voice
could
be
heard
across
the
waters
urging
them
to
pull
while
the
bows
swept
across
the
current
they
obeyed
him
but
steadily
the
blackness
ate
out
the
light
and
a
weird
gloaming
overspread
the
scene
river
and
forest
became
stern
the
men
silent
the
more
ignorant
were
in
fear
of
a
cataclysm
the
others
taking
it
for
an
omen
shucks
said
tom
when
appealed
to
i
ve
seed
it
afore
and
it
come
all
right
clark
s
boat
rounded
the
shoal
next
our
turn
came
and
then
the
whole
line
was
gliding
down
the
river
the
rising
roar
of
the
angry
waters
with
which
we
were
soon
to
grapple
coming
to
us
with
an
added
grimness
and
now
but
a
faint
rim
of
light
saved
us
from
utter
darkness
big
bill
cowan
undaunted
in
war
stared
at
me
with
fright
written
on
his
face
and
what
ll
ye
think
of
it
davy
he
said
i
glanced
at
the
figure
of
our
commander
in
the
boat
ahead
and
took
courage
it
s
hamilton
s
scalp
hanging
by
a
lock
i
answered
pointing
to
what
was
left
of
the
sun
soon
it
will
be
off
and
then
we
ll
have
light
to
my
surprise
he
snatched
me
from
the
thwart
and
held
me
up
with
a
shout
and
i
saw
colonel
clark
turn
and
look
back
davy
says
the
ha
r
buyer
s
sculp
hangs
by
the
lock
boys
he
shouted
pointing
at
the
sun
the
word
was
cried
from
boat
to
boat
and
we
could
see
the
men
pointing
upwards
and
laughing
and
then
as
the
light
began
to
grow
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
tumbling
waters
the
steersmen
straining
now
right
now
left
to
keep
the
prows
in
the
smooth
reaches
between
rock
and
bar
we
gained
the
still
pools
below
the
sun
came
out
once
more
and
smiled
on
the
landscape
and
the
spirits
of
the
men
reviving
burst
all
bounds
thus
i
earned
my
reputation
as
a
prophet
four
days
and
nights
we
rowed
down
the
great
river
our
oars
for
fear
that
our
coming
might
be
heralded
to
the
french
towns
we
made
our
first
camp
on
a
green
little
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
cherokee
as
we
then
called
the
tennessee
and
there
i
set
about
cooking
a
turkey
for
colonel
clark
which
ray
had
shot
chancing
to
look
up
i
saw
the
colonel
himself
watching
me
how
is
this
davy
said
he
i
hear
that
you
have
saved
my
army
for
me
before
we
have
met
the
i
did
not
know
it
sir
i
answered
well
said
he
if
you
have
learned
to
turn
an
evil
omen
into
a
good
sign
you
know
more
than
some
generals
what
ails
you
now
there
s
a
pirogue
sir
i
cried
staring
and
pointing
where
said
he
alert
all
at
once
here
mcchesney
take
a
crew
and
put
out
after
he
had
scarcely
spoken
ere
tom
and
his
men
were
rowing
into
the
sunset
the
whole
of
our
little
army
watching
from
the
bank
presently
the
other
boat
was
seen
coming
back
with
ours
and
five
strange
woodsmen
stepped
ashore
our
men
pressing
around
them
but
clark
flew
to
the
spot
the
men
giving
back
who
s
the
leader
here
he
demanded
a
tall
man
stepped
forward
i
am
said
he
bewildered
but
defiant
your
name
john
duff
he
answered
as
though
against
his
will
your
business
hunters
said
duff
and
i
reckon
we
re
in
our
i
ll
judge
of
that
said
our
colonel
where
are
you
from
that
s
no
secret
neither
kaskasky
ten
days
at
that
there
was
a
murmur
of

said
john
duff
boys
we
re
rebels
now
steer
clear
of
the
ha
r
chapter
xiii
kaskaskia
for
one
more
day
we
floated
downward
on
the
face
of
the
waters
between
the
forest
walls
of
the
wilderness
and
at
length
we
landed
in
a
little
gully
on
the
north
shore
of
the
river
and
there
we
hid
our
boats
davy
said
colonel
clark
let
s
walk
about
a
bit
tell
me
where
you
learned
to
be
so
silent
my
father
did
not
like
to
be
talked
to
i
answered
except
when
he
was
he
gave
me
a
strange
look
many
the
stroll
i
took
with
him
afterwards
when
he
sought
to
relax
himself
from
the
cares
which
the
campaign
had
put
upon
him
this
night
was
still
and
clear
the
west
all
yellow
with
the
departing
light
and
the
mists
coming
on
the
river
and
presently
as
we
strayed
down
the
shore
we
came
upon
a
strange
sight
the
same
being
a
huge
fort
rising
from
the
waterside
all
overgrown
with
brush
and
saplings
and
tall
weeds
the
palisades
that
held
its
earthenwork
were
rotten
and
crumbling
and
the
mighty
bastions
of
its
corners
sliding
away
behind
the
fort
at
the
end
farthest
from
the
river
we
came
upon
gravelled
walks
hidden
by
the
rank
growth
where
the
soldiers
of
his
most
christian
majesty
once
paraded
lost
in
thought
clark
stood
on
the
parapet
watching
the
water
gliding
by
until
the
darkness
hid
it
nay
until
the
stars
came
and
made
golden
dimples
upon
its
surface
but
as
we
went
back
to
the
camp
again
he
told
me
how
the
french
had
tried
once
to
conquer
this
vast
country
and
failed
leaving
to
the
spaniards
the
endless
stretch
beyond
the
mississippi
called
louisiana
and
this
part
to
the
english
and
he
told
me
likewise
that
this
fort
in
the
days
of
its
glory
had
been
called
massacre
from
a
bloody
event
which
had
happened
there
more
than
threescore
years
before
threescore
years
i
exclaimed
longing
to
see
the
men
of
this
race
which
had
set
up
these
monuments
only
to
abandon
them
ay
lad
he
answered
before
you
or
i
were
born
and
before
our
fathers
were
born
the
french
missionaries
and
soldiers
threaded
this
wilderness
and
they
called
this
river
la
belle
rivière
the
beautiful
and
shall
i
see
that
race
at
kaskaskia
i
asked
wondering
that
you
shall
he
cried
with
a
force
that
left
no
doubt
in
my
mind
in
the
morning
we
broke
camp
and
started
off
for
the
strange
place
which
we
hoped
to
capture
a
hundred
miles
it
was
across
the
trackless
wilds
and
each
man
was
ordered
to
carry
on
his
back
provisions
for
four
days
only
herr
gott
cried
swein
poulsson
from
the
bottom
of
a
flatboat
whence
he
was
tossing
out
venison

i
do

pessimistic
mcandrew

they

the
colonel

no

of
that

cried
cowan
angrily
pitch
him
in
the
crick
mac
tom
was
diverted
from
this
duty
by
a
loud
quarrel
between
captain
harrod
and
five
men
of
the
company
who
wanted
scout
duty
and
on
the
heels
of
that
came
another
turmoil
occasioned
by
cowan
s
dropping
my
drum
into
the
water
while
he
and
mccann
and
tom
were
fishing
it
out
colonel
clark
himself
appeared
quelled
the
mutiny
that
harrod
had
on
his
hands
and
bade
the
men
sternly
to
get
into
ranks
what
foolishness
is
this
he
said
eying
the
dripping
drum
sure
colonel
said
mccann
swinging
it
on
his
back
we
d
have
no
heart
in
us
at
kaskasky
widout
the
rattle
of
it
in

ears

cowan
and
me
will
not
be
feeling
the
heft
of
it
bechune

said
the
colonel
amusement
struggling
with
the
anger
in
his
face
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
his
wisdom
well
knew
when
to
humor
a
man
and
when
to
chastise
arrah
said
terence
as
he
took
his
place
i
d
as
soon
l
ave
me
gun
behind
as
davy
and
the
methinks
i
can
see
now
as
i
write
the
long
file
of
woodsmen
with
their
swinging
stride
planting
one
foot
before
the
other
even
as
the
indian
himself
threaded
the
wilderness
though
my
legs
were
short
i
had
both
sinew
and
training
and
now
i
was
at
one
end
of
the
line
and
now
at
the
other
and
often
with
a
laugh
some
giant
would
hand
his
gun
to
a
neighbor
swing
me
to
his
shoulder
and
so
give
me
a
lift
for
a
weary
mile
or
two
and
perchance
whisper
to
me
to
put
down
my
hand
into
the
wallet
of
his
shirt
where
i
would
find
a
choice
morsel
which
he
had
saved
for
his
supper
sometimes
i
trotted
beside
the
colonel
himself
listening
as
he
talked
to
this
man
or
that
and
thus
i
got
the
gravest
notion
of
the
daring
of
this
undertaking
and
of
the
dangers
ahead
of
us
this
north
country
was
infested
with
indians
allies
of
the
english
and
friends
of
the
french
their
subjects
and
the
fact
was
never
for
an
instant
absent
from
our
minds
that
our
little
band
might
at
any
moment
run
into
a
thousand
warriors
be
overpowered
and
massacred
or
worst
of
all
that
our
coming
might
have
been
heralded
to
kaskaskia
for
three
days
we
marched
in
the
green
shade
of
the
primeval
wood
nor
saw
the
sky
save
in
blue
patches
here
and
there
again
we
toiled
for
hours
through
the
waters
of
the
swamps
but
the
third
day
brought
us
to
the
first
of
those
strange
clearings
which
the
french
call
prairies
where
the
long
grass
ripples
like
a
lake
in
the
summer
wind
here
we
first
knew
raging
thirst
and
longed
for
the
water
we
had
scorned
as
our
tired
feet
tore
through
the
grass
for
saunders
our
guide
took
a
line
across
the
open
in
plain
sight
of
any
eye
that
might
be
watching
from
the
forest
cover
but
at
length
our
column
wavered
and
halted
by
reason
of
some
disturbance
at
the
head
of
it
conjectures
in
our
company
the
rear
guard
became
rife
at
once
run
davy
darlin
an
see
what
the
throuble
is
said
terence
nothing
loath
i
made
my
way
to
the
head
of
the
column
where
bowman
s
company
had
broken
ranks
and
stood
in
a
ring
up
to
their
thighs
in
the
grass
in
the
centre
of
the
ring
standing
on
one
foot
before
our
angry
colonel
was
saunders
now
what
does
this
mean
demanded
clark
my
eye
is
on
you
and
you
ve
boxed
the
compass
in
this
last
saunders
jaw
dropped
i
m
guiding
you
right
he
answered
with
that
sullenness
which
comes
to
his
kind
from
fear
but
a
man
will
slip
his
bearings
sometimes
in
this
clark
s
eyes
shot
fire
and
he
brought
down
the
stock
of
his
rifle
with
a
thud
by
the
eternal
god
he
cried
i
believe
you
are
a
traitor
i
ve
been
watching
you
every
step
and
you
ve
acted
strangely
this
ay
ay
came
from
the
men
round
him
silence
cried
clark
and
turned
again
to
the
cowering
saunders
you
pretend
to
know
the
way
to
kaskaskia
you
bring
us
to
the
middle
of
the
indian
country
where
we
may
be
wiped
out
at
any
time
and
now
you
have
the
damned
effrontery
to
tell
me
that
you
have
lost
your
way
i
am
a
man
of
my
word
he
added
with
a
vibrant
intensity
and
pointed
to
the
limbs
of
a
giant
tree
which
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
distant
forest
i
will
give
you
half
an
hour
but
as
i
live
i
will
leave
you
hanging
the
man
s
brown
hand
trembled
as
he
clutched
his
rifle
barrel
tis
a
hard
country
sir
he
said
i
m
lost
i
swear
it
on
the
a
hard
country
cried
clark
a
man
would
have
to
walk
over
it
but
once
to
know
it
i
believe
you
are
a
damned
traitor
and
perjurer
in
spite
of
your
oath
a
british
saunders
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
on
his
buckskin
sleeve
i
reckon
i
could
get
the
trace
colonel
if
you
d
let
me
go
a
little
way
into
the
half
an
hour
said
clark
and
you
ll
not
go
sweeping
his
eye
over
bowman
s
company
he
picked
out
a
man
here
and
a
man
there
to
go
with
saunders
then
his
eye
lighted
on
me
where
s
mcchesney
he
said
fetch
i
ran
to
get
tom
and
seven
of
them
went
away
with
saunders
in
the
middle
clark
watching
them
like
a
hawk
while
the
men
sat
down
in
the
grass
to
wait
fifteen
minutes
went
by
and
twenty
and
and
clark
was
calling
for
a
rope
when
some
one
caught
sight
of
the
squad
in
the
distance
returning
at
a
run
and
when
they
came
within
hail
it
was
saunders
voice
we
heard
shouting
brokenly
i
ve
struck
it
colonel
i
ve
struck
the
trace
there
s
a
pecan
at
the
edge
of
the
bottom
with
my
own
blaze
on
may
you
never
be
as
near
death
again
said
the
colonel
grimly
as
he
gave
the
order
to
march
the
fourth
day
passed
and
we
left
behind
us
the
patches
of
forest
and
came
into
the
open
prairie
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
a
long
level
sea
of
waving
green
the
scanty
provisions
ran
out
hunger
was
added
to
the
pangs
of
thirst
and
weariness
and
here
and
there
in
the
straggling
file
discontent
smouldered
and
angry
undertone
was
heard
kaskaskia
was
somewhere
to
the
west
and
north
but
how
far
clark
had
misled
them
and
in
addition
it
were
foolish
to
believe
that
the
garrison
had
not
been
warned
english
soldiers
and
french
militia
and
indian
allies
stood
ready
for
our
reception
of
such
was
the
talk
as
we
lay
down
in
the
grass
under
the
stars
on
the
fifth
night
for
in
the
rank
and
file
an
empty
stomach
is
not
hopeful
the
next
morning
we
took
up
our
march
silently
with
the
dawn
the
prairie
grouse
whirring
ahead
of
us
at
last
as
afternoon
drew
on
a
dark
line
of
green
edged
the
prairie
to
the
westward
and
our
spirits
rose
from
mouth
to
mouth
ran
the
word
that
these
were
the
woods
which
fringed
the
bluff
above
kaskaskia
itself
we
pressed
ahead
and
the
destiny
of
the
new
republic
for
which
we
had
fought
made
us
walk
unseen
excitement
keyed
us
high
we
reached
the
shade
plunged
into
it
and
presently
came
out
staring
at
the
bastioned
corners
of
a
fort
which
rose
from
the
centre
of
a
clearing
it
had
once
defended
the
place
but
now
stood
abandoned
and
dismantled
beyond
it
at
the
edge
of
the
bluff
we
halted
astonished
the
sun
was
falling
in
the
west
and
below
us
was
the
goal
for
the
sight
of
which
we
had
suffered
so
much
at
our
feet
across
the
wooded
bottom
was
the
kaskaskia
river
and
beyond
the
peaceful
little
french
village
with
its
low
houses
and
orchards
and
gardens
colored
by
the
touch
of
the
evening
light
in
the
centre
of
it
stood
a
stone
church
with
its
belfry
but
our
searching
eyes
alighted
on
the
spot
to
the
southward
of
it
near
the
river
there
stood
a
rambling
stone
building
with
the
shingles
of
its
roof
weathered
black
and
all
around
it
a
palisade
of
pointed
sticks
thrust
in
the
ground
and
with
a
pair
of
gates
and
drooping
on
its
staff
was
the
standard
of
england
north
and
south
of
the
village
the
emerald
common
gleamed
in
the
slanting
light
speckled
red
and
white
and
black
by
grazing
cattle
here
and
there
in
untidy
brown
patches
were
indian
settlements
and
far
away
to
the
westward
the
tawny
father
of
waters
gleamed
through
the
cottonwoods
through
the
waning
day
the
men
lay
resting
under
the
trees
talking
in
undertones
some
cleaned
their
rifles
and
others
lost
themselves
in
conjectures
of
the
attack
but
clark
himself
tireless
stood
with
folded
arms
gazing
at
the
scene
below
and
the
sunlight
on
his
face
illumined
him
to
the
lad
standing
at
his
side
as
the
servant
of
destiny
at
length
at
eventide
the
bell
of
the
little
cathedral
rang
to
vespers
a
gentle
message
of
peace
to
war
colonel
clark
looked
into
my
upturned
face
davy
do
you
know
what
day
this
is
he
asked
no
sir
i
answered
two
years
have
gone
since
the
bells
pealed
for
the
birth
of
a
new
nation
your
nation
davy
and
mine
the
nation
that
is
to
be
the
refuge
of
the
oppressed
of
this
earth
the
nation
which
is
to
be
made
of
all
peoples
out
of
all
time
and
this
land
for
which
you
and
i
shall
fight
will
belong
to
it
and
the
lands
beyond
he
pointed
to
the
west
until
the
sun
sets
on
the
sea
he
put
his
hand
on
my
head
you
will
remember
this
when
i
am
dead
and
gone
he
said
i
was
silent
awed
by
the
power
of
his
words
darkness
fell
and
still
we
waited
impatient
for
the
order
and
when
at
last
it
came
the
men
bustled
hither
and
thither
to
find
their
commands
and
we
picked
our
way
on
the
unseen
road
that
led
down
the
bluff
our
hearts
thumping
the
lights
of
the
village
twinkled
at
our
feet
and
now
and
then
a
voice
from
below
was
caught
and
borne
upward
to
us
once
another
noise
startled
us
followed
by
an
exclamation
donnerblitzen
and
a
volley
of
low
curses
from
the
company
poor
swein
poulsson
had
loosed
a
stone
which
had
taken
a
reverberating
flight
riverward
we
reached
the
bottom
and
the
long
file
turned
and
hurried
silently
northward
searching
for
a
crossing
i
try
to
recall
my
feelings
as
i
trotted
beside
the
tall
forms
that
loomed
above
me
in
the
night
the
sense
of
protection
they
gave
me
stripped
me
of
fear
and
i
was
not
troubled
with
that
my
thoughts
were
chiefly
on
polly
ann
and
the
child
we
had
left
in
the
fort
now
so
far
to
the
south
of
us
and
in
my
fancy
i
saw
her
cheerful
ever
helpful
to
those
around
her
despite
the
load
that
must
rest
on
her
heart
i
saw
her
simple
joy
at
our
return
but
should
we
return
my
chest
tightened
and
i
sped
along
the
ranks
to
harrod
s
company
and
caught
tom
by
the
wrist
davy
he
murmured
and
seizing
my
hand
in
his
strong
grip
pulled
me
along
with
him
for
it
was
not
given
to
him
to
say
what
he
felt
but
as
i
hurried
to
keep
pace
with
his
stride
polly
ann
s
words
rang
in
my
ears
davy
take
care
of
my
tom
and
i
knew
that
he
too
was
thinking
of
her
a
hail
aroused
me
the
sound
of
a
loud
rapping
and
i
saw
in
black
relief
a
cabin
ahead
the
door
opened
a
man
came
out
with
a
horde
of
children
cowering
at
his
heels
a
volley
of
frightened
words
pouring
from
his
mouth
in
a
strange
tongue
john
duff
was
plying
him
with
questions
in
french
and
presently
the
man
became
calmer
and
lapsed
into
broken
english
kaskaskia
yes
she
is
prepare
many
spy
is
gone
out
cross
la
rivière
but
now
they
all
even
as
he
spoke
a
shout
came
faintly
from
the
distant
town
what
is
that
demanded
clark
sharply
the
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
une
fête
des
nègres
the
negro
he
dance
are
you
the
ferryman
said
clark
oui
i
have
some
we
crossed
the
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
sluggish
water
squad
by
squad
and
in
the
silence
of
the
night
stood
gathered
expectant
on
the
farther
bank
midnight
was
at
hand
commands
were
passed
about
and
men
ran
this
way
and
that
jostling
one
another
to
find
their
places
in
a
new
order
but
at
length
our
little
force
stood
in
three
detachments
on
the
river
s
bank
their
captains
repeating
again
and
again
the
part
which
each
was
to
play
that
none
might
mistake
his
duty
the
two
larger
ones
were
to
surround
the
town
while
the
picked
force
under
simon
kenton
himself
was
to
storm
the
fort
should
he
gain
it
by
surprise
and
without
battle
three
shots
were
to
be
fired
in
quick
succession
the
other
detachments
were
to
start
the
while
duff
and
some
with
a
smattering
of
french
were
to
run
up
and
down
the
streets
proclaiming
that
every
habitan
who
left
his
house
would
be
shot
no
provision
being
made
for
the
drummer
boy
i
had
left
my
drum
on
the
heights
above
i
chose
the
favored
column
at
the
head
of
which
tom
and
cowan
and
ray
and
mccann
were
striding
behind
kenton
and
colonel
clark
not
a
word
was
spoken
there
was
a
kind
of
that
rose
and
fell
and
twisted
along
the
this
we
followed
and
in
ten
minutes
we
must
have
covered
the
mile
to
the
now
darkened
village
the
starlight
alone
outlined
against
the
sky
the
houses
of
it
as
we
climbed
the
bank
then
we
halted
breathless
in
a
street
but
there
was
no
sound
save
that
of
the
crickets
and
the
frogs
forward
again
and
twisting
a
corner
we
beheld
the
indented
edge
of
the
stockade
still
no
hail
nor
had
our
moccasined
feet
betrayed
us
as
we
sought
the
river
side
of
the
fort
and
drew
up
before
the
big
river
gates
of
it
simon
kenton
bore
against
them
and
tried
the
little
postern
that
was
set
there
but
both
were
fast
the
spikes
towered
a
dozen
feet
overhead
quick
muttered
clark
a
light
man
to
go
over
and
open
the
before
i
guessed
what
was
in
his
mind
cowan
seized
me
send
the
lad
colonel
said
he
ay
ay
said
simon
kenton
hoarsely
in
a
second
tom
was
on
kenton
s
shoulders
and
they
passed
me
up
with
as
little
trouble
as
though
i
had
been
my
own
drum
feverishly
searching
with
my
foot
for
tom
s
shoulder
i
seized
the
spikes
at
the
top
clambered
over
them
paused
surveyed
the
empty
area
below
me
destitute
even
of
a
sentry
and
then
let
myself
down
with
the
aid
of
the
inside
as
i
was
feeling
vainly
for
the
bolt
of
the
postern
rays
of
light
suddenly
shot
my
shadow
against
the
door
and
next
as
i
got
my
hand
on
the
i
felt
the
weight
of
another
on
my
shoulder
and
a
voice
behind
me
said
in
english
in
the
devil
s
name
i
gave
the
one
frantic
pull
the
bolt
slipped
and
caught
again
then
colonel
clark
s
voice
rang
out
in
the
night
open
the
gate
open
the
gate
in
the
name
of
virginia
and
the
continental
congress
before
i
could
cry
out
the
man
gave
a
grunt
leaned
his
gun
against
the
gate
and
tore
my
fingers
from
the
astonishment
robbed
me
of
breath
as
he
threw
open
the
postern
in
the
name
of
the
continental
congress
he
cried
and
seized
his
gun
clark
and
kenton
stepped
in
instantly
no
doubt
as
astounded
as
i
and
had
the
man
in
their
grasp
who
are
you
said
clark
name
o
skene
from
pennsylvanya
said
the
man
and
by
the
lord
god
ye
shall
have
the
you
looked
for
us
said
clark
faith
never
less
said
the
pennsylvanian
the
one

at
the
main
and
the
governor

said
the
pennsylvanian
he
sleeps
yonder
in
the
old

house
in
the
clark

to
tom
mcchesney
who
was
at
his
elbow

said
he
swiftly
secure
the
sentry
at
the
main
gate
you
he
added
turning
to
the
pennsylvanian
lead
us
to
the
governor
but
mind
if
you
betray
me
i
ll
be
the
first
to
blow
out
your
the
man
seized
a
lantern
and
made
swiftly
over
the
level
ground
until
the
of
the
old
jesuit
house
showed
in
the
light
nor
clark
nor
any
of
them
stopped
to
think
of
the
danger
our
little
handful
ran
at
the
mercy
of
a
stranger
the
house
was
silent
we
halted
and
clark
threw
himself
against
the
rude
panels
of
the
door
which
gave
to
inward
blackness
our
men
filled
the
little
passage
and
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
a
room
in
front
of
a
great
bed
and
in
it
upright
blinking
at
the
light
were
two
odd
frenchified
figures
in
tasselled
nightcaps
astonishment
and
anger
and
fear
struggled
in
the
faces
of
monsieur
de
rocheblave
and
his
lady
a
regard
for
truth
compels
me
to
admit
that
it
was
madame
who
first
found
her
voice
and
no
uncertain
one
it
was
first
came
a
shriek
that
might
have
roused
the
garrison
villains
murderers
outragers
of
decency
she
cried
with
spirit
pouring
a
heap
of
invectives
now
in
french
now
in
english
much
to
the
discomfiture
of
our
backwoodsmen
who
peered
at
her
helplessly
nom
du
diable
cried
the
commandant
when
his
lady
s
breath
was
gone
what
does
this
mean
it
means
sir
answered
clark
promptly
that
you
are
my
and
who
are
you
gasped
the
commandant
george
rogers
clark
colonel
in
the
service
of
the
commonwealth
of
he
held
out
his
hand
restrainingly
for
the
furious
monsieur
rocheblave
made
an
attempt
to
rise
you
will
oblige
me
by
remaining
in
bed
sir
for
a
coquins
canailles
cochons
shrieked
the
lady
madame
said
colonel
clark
politely
the
necessities
of
war
are
often
he
made
a
bow
and
paying
no
further
attention
to
the
torrent
of
her
reproaches
or
the
threats
of
the
helpless
commandant
he
calmly
searched
the
room
with
the
lantern
and
finally
pulled
out
from
under
the
bed
a
metal
despatch
box
then
he
lighted
a
candle
in
a
brass
candlestick
that
stood
on
the
simple
walnut
dresser
and
bowed
again
to
the
outraged
couple
in
the
now
sir
he
said
you
may
dress
we
will
pardieu
said
the
commandant
in
french
a
hundred
thousand
we
had
scarcely
closed
the
bedroom
door
when
three
shots
were
heard
the
signal
exclaimed
clark
immediately
a
pandemonium
broke
on
the
silence
of
the
night
that
must
have
struck
cold
terror
in
the
hearts
of
the
poor
creoles
sleeping
in
their
beds
the
the
scalp
halloo
in
the
dead
of
the
morning
with
the
hideous
winding
notes
of
them
that
reached
the
bluff
beyond
and
echoed
back
were
enough
to
frighten
a
man
from
his
senses
in
the
intervals
in
backwoods
french
john
duff
and
his
companions
were
heard
in
terrifying
tones
crying
out
to
the
habitans
to
venture
out
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
within
the
fort
a
score
of
lights
flew
up
and
down
like
and
colonel
clark
standing
on
the
steps
of
the
governor
s
house
gave
out
his
orders
and
despatched
his
messengers
me
he
sent
speeding
through
the
village
to
tell
captain
bowman
to
patrol
the
outskirts
of
the
town
that
no
runner
might
get
through
to
warn
fort
chartres
and
cohos
as
some
called
cahokia
none
stirred
save
the
few
indians
left
in
the
place
and
these
were
brought
before
clark
in
the
fort
sullen
and
defiant
and
put
in
the
there
and
rocheblave
when
he
appeared
was
no
better
and
was
put
back
in
his
house
under
guard
as
for
the
papers
in
the
despatch
box
they
revealed
i
know
not
what
briberies
of
the
savage
nations
and
plans
of
the
english
but
of
other
papers
we
found
none
though
there
must
have
been
more
madame
rocheblave
was
suspected
of
having
hidden
some
in
the
inviolable
portions
of
her
dress
at
length
the
cocks
crowing
for
day
proclaimed
the
morning
and
while
yet
the
blue
shadow
of
the
bluff
was
on
the
town
colonel
clark
sallied
out
of
the
gate
and
walked
abroad
strange
it
seemed
that
war
had
come
to
this
village
so
peaceful
and
remote
and
even
stranger
it
seemed
to
me
to
see
these
arcadian
homes
in
the
midst
of
the
fierce
wilderness
the
little
houses
with
their
sloping
roofs
and
wide
porches
the
gardens
ablaze
with
color
the
neat
palings
all
were
a
restful
sight
for
our
weary
eyes
and
now
i
scarcely
knew
our
commander
for
we
had
not
gone
far
ere
timidly
a
door
opened
and
a
man
in
the
simple
workaday
smock
that
the
french
wore
stood
hesitating
on
the
steps
the
odd
thing
was
that
he
should
have
bowed
to
clark
who
was
dressed
no
differently
from
bowman
and
harrod
and
duff
and
the
man
s
voice
trembled
piteously
as
he
spoke
it
needed
not
john
duff
to
tell
us
that
he
was
pleading
for
the
lives
of
his
family
he
will
sell
himself
as
a
slave
if
your
excellency
will
spare
them
said
duff
translating
but
clark
stared
at
the
man
sternly
i
will
tell
them
my
plans
at
the
proper
time
he
said
and
when
duff
had
translated
this
the
man
turned
and
went
silently
into
his
house
again
closing
the
door
behind
him
and
before
we
had
traversed
the
village
the
same
thing
had
happened
many
times
we
gained
the
fort
again
i
wondering
greatly
why
he
had
not
reassured
these
simple
people
it
was
bowman
who
asked
this
question
he
being
closer
to
clark
than
any
of
the
other
captains
clark
said
nothing
then
and
began
to
give
out
directions
for
the
day
but
presently
he
called
the
captain
aside
bowman
i
heard
him
say
we
have
one
hundred
and
fifty
men
to
hold
a
province
bigger
than
the
whole
of
france
and
filled
with
treacherous
tribes
in
the
king
s
pay
i
must
work
out
the
problem
for
bowman
was
silent
clark
with
that
touch
which
made
men
love
him
and
die
for
him
laid
his
hand
on
the
captain
s
shoulder
have
the
men
called
in
by
detachments
he
said
and
fed
god
knows
they
must
be
hungry
and
suddenly
i
remembered
that
he
himself
had
had
nothing
running
around
the
commandant
s
house
to
the
kitchen
door
i
came
unexpectedly
upon
swein
poulsson
who
was
face
to
face
with
the
figure
of
monsieur
rocheblave
s
negro
cook
the
early
sun
cast
long
shadows
of
them
on
the
ground
by
tam
my
friend
was
saying
so

said
the
cook
with
a
terrified
roll
of
his
white
eyes

swein
poulsson
i

aber

it

let
us
in
the
kitchen
i
am
come
to
get
something
for
the
colonel
s
breakfast
said
i
pushing
past
the
slave
through
the
open
doorway
swein
poulsson
followed
and
here
i
struck
another
contradiction
in
his
strange
nature
he
helped
me
light
the
fire
in
the
great
stone
and
we
soon
had
a
pot
of
hominy
on
the
crane
and
turning
on
the
spit
a
piece
of
buffalo
steak
which
we
found
in
the
larder
nor
did
a
mouthful
pass
his
lips
until
i
had
sped
away
with
a
steaming
portion
to
find
the
colonel
by
this
time
the
men
had
broken
into
the
storehouse
and
the
open
place
was
dotted
with
their
breakfast
fires
clark
was
standing
alone
by
the
flagstaff
his
face
careworn
but
he
smiled
as
he
saw
me
coming
what
s
this
says
he
your
breakfast
sir
i
answered
i
set
down
the
plate
and
the
pot
before
him
and
pressed
the
pewter
spoon
into
his
hand
davy
said
he
sir
said
i
what
did
you
have
for
your
breakfast
my
lip
trembled
for
i
was
very
hungry
and
the
rich
steam
from
the
hominy
was
as
much
as
i
could
stand
then
the
colonel
took
me
by
the
arms
as
gently
as
a
woman
might
set
me
down
on
the
ground
beside
him
and
taking
a
spoonful
of
the
hominy
forced
it
between
my
lips
i
was
near
to
fainting
at
the
taste
of
it
then
he
took
a
bit
himself
and
divided
the
buffalo
steak
with
his
own
hands
and
when
from
the
they
perceived
the
colonel
and
the
drummer
boy
eating
together
in
plain
sight
of
all
they
gave
a
rousing
cheer
swein
poulsson
helped
get
your
breakfast
sir
and
would
eat
nothing
either
i
ventured
davy
said
colonel
clark
gravely
i
hope
you
will
be
younger
when
you
are
i
hope
i
shall
be
bigger
sir
i
answered
gravely
chapter
xiv
how
the
kaskaskeians
were
made
citizens
never
before
had
such
a
day
dawned
upon
kaskaskia
with
july
fierceness
the
sun
beat
down
upon
the
village
but
man
nor
woman
nor
child
stirred
from
the
darkened
houses
what
they
awaited
at
the
hands
of
the
long
knives
they
knew
not
captivity
torture
death
perhaps
through
the
deserted
streets
stalked
a
squad
of
backwoodsmen
headed
by
john
duff
and
two
american
traders
found
in
the
town
who
were
bestirring
themselves
in
our
behalf
knocking
now
at
this
door
and
anon
at
that
the
colonel
bids
you
come
to
the
fort
he
said
and
was
gone
the
church
bell
rang
with
slow
ominous
strokes
far
different
from
its
gentle
vesper
peal
of
yesterday
two
companies
were
drawn
up
in
the
sun
before
the
old
jesuit
house
and
presently
through
the
gate
a
procession
came
grave
and
mournful
the
tone
of
it
was
sombre
in
the
white
glare
for
men
had
donned
their
best
as
they
thought
for
the
last
time
cloth
of
camlet
and
cadiz
and
limbourg
white
cotton
stockings
and
shoes
they
came
like
captives
led
to
execution
but
at
their
head
a
figure
held
our
eye
a
figure
that
spoke
of
dignity
and
courage
of
trials
borne
for
others
it
was
the
village
priest
in
his
robes
he
had
a
receding
forehead
and
a
strong
pointed
chin
but
benevolence
was
in
the
curve
of
his
great
nose
i
have
many
times
since
seen
his
type
of
face
in
the
french
prints
he
and
his
flock
halted
before
our
young
colonel
even
as
the
citizens
of
calais
in
a
bygone
century
must
have
stood
before
the
english
king
the
scene
comes
back
to
me
on
the
one
side
not
the
warriors
of
a
nation
that
has
made
its
mark
in
war
but
peaceful
peasants
who
had
sought
this
place
for
its
remoteness
from
persecution
to
live
and
die
in
harmony
with
all
mankind
on
the
other
the
sinewy
advance
guard
of
a
race
that
knows
not
peace
whose
goddess
of
liberty
carries
in
her
hand
a
sword
the
plough
might
have
been
graven
on
our
arms
but
always
the
rifle
the
silence
of
the
trackless
wilds
reigned
while
clark
gazed
at
them
sternly
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
with
the
voice
of
a
conqueror
and
they
listened
as
the
conquered
listen
with
heads
bowed
all
save
the
priest
clark
told
them
first
that
they
had
been
given
a
false
and
a
wicked
notion
of
the
american
cause
and
he
spoke
of
the
tyranny
of
the
english
king
which
had
become
past
endurance
to
a
free
people
as
for
ourselves
the
long
knives
we
came
in
truth
to
conquer
and
because
of
their
hasty
judgment
the
kaskaskians
were
at
our
mercy
the
british
had
told
them
that
the
kentuckians
were
a
barbarous
people
and
they
had
believed
he
paused
that
john
duff
might
translate
and
the
gist
of
what
he
had
said
sink
in
but
suddenly
the
priest
had
stepped
out
from
the
ranks
faced
his
people
and
was
himself
translating
in
a
strong
voice
when
he
had
finished
a
tremor
shook
the
group
but
he
turned
calmly
and
faced
clark
once
more
citizens
of
kaskaskia
colonel
clark
went
on
the
king
whom
you
renounced
when
the
english
conquered
you
the
great
king
of
france
has
judged
for
you
and
the
french
people
knowing
that
the
american
cause
is
just
he
is
sending
his
fleets
and
regiments
to
fight
for
it
against
the
british
king
who
until
now
has
been
your
again
he
paused
and
when
the
priest
had
told
them
this
a
murmur
of
astonishment
came
from
the
boldest
citizens
of
kaskaskia
know
you
that
the
long
knives
come
not
to
massacre
as
you
foolishly
believed
but
to
release
from
bondage
we
are
come
not
against
you
who
have
been
deceived
but
against
those
soldiers
of
the
british
king
who
have
bribed
the
savages
to
slaughter
our
wives
and
children
you
have
but
to
take
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
continental
congress
to
become
free
even
as
we
are
to
enjoy
the
blessings
of
that
american
government
under
which
we
live
and
for
which
we
the
face
of
the
good
priest
kindled
as
he
glanced
at
clark
he
turned
once
more
and
though
we
could
not
understand
his
words
the
thrill
of
his
eloquence
moved
us
and
when
he
had
finished
there
was
a
moment
s
hush
of
inarticulate
joy
among
his
flock
and
then
such
transports
as
moved
strangely
the
sternest
men
in
our
ranks
the
simple
people
fell
to
embracing
each
other
and
praising
god
the
tears
running
on
their
cheeks
out
of
the
group
came
an
old
man
a
skullcap
rested
on
his
silvered
hair
and
he
felt
the
ground
uncertainly
with
his
stick
monsieur
he
said
tremulously
you
will
pardon
an
old
man
if
he
show
feeling
i
am
born
seventy
year
ago
in
gascon
i
inhabit
this
country
thirty
year
and
last
night
i
think
i
not
live
any
longer
last
night
we
make
our
peace
with
the
good
god
and
come
here
to
die
but
we
know
you
not
he
cried
with
a
sudden
and
surprising
vigor
ha
we
know
you
not
they
told
us
lies
and
we
were
humble
and
believed
but
now
we
are
américains
he
cried
his
voice
pitched
high
as
he
pointed
with
a
trembling
arm
to
the
stars
and
stripes
above
him
mes
enfants
vive

vive
monsieur
le
colonel
clark
sauveur
de
kaskaskia
the
listening
village
heard
the
shout
and
wondered
and
when
it
had
died
down
colonel
clark
took
the
old
gascon
by
the
hand
and
not
a
man
of
his
but
saw
that
this
was
a
of
his
genius
my
friends
he
said
simply
i
thank
you
i
would
not
force
you
and
you
will
have
some
days
to
think
over
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
republic
go
now
to
your
homes
and
tell
those
who
are
awaiting
you
what
i
have
said
and
if
any
man
of
french
birth
wish
to
leave
this
place
he
may
go
of
his
own
free
will
save
only
three
whom
i
suspect
are
not
our
they
turned
and
in
an
ecstasy
of
joy
quite
pitiful
to
see
went
trooping
out
of
the
gate
but
scarce
could
they
have
reached
the
street
and
we
have
broken
ranks
when
we
saw
them
coming
back
again
the
priest
leading
them
as
before
they
drew
near
to
the
spot
where
clark
stood
talking
to
the
captains
and
halted
expectantly
what
is
it
my
friends
asked
the
colonel
the
priest
came
forward
and
bowed
gravely
i
am
père
gibault
sir
he
said
curé
of
he
paused
surveying
our
commander
with
a
clear
eye
there
is
something
that
still
troubles
the
good
and
what
is
that
sir
said
clark
the
priest
hesitated
if
your
excellency
will
only
allow
the
church
to
be
opened
he
ventured
the
group
stood
wistful
fearful
that
their
boldness
had
displeased
expectant
of
reprimand
my
good
father
said
colonel
clark
an
american
commander
has
but
one
relation
to
any
church
and
that
is
he
added
with
force
to
protect
it
for
all
religions
are
equal
before
the
the
priest
gazed
at
him
intently
by
that
answer
said
he
your
excellency
has
made
for
your
government
loyal
citizens
in
then
the
colonel
stepped
up
to
the
priest
and
took
him
likewise
by
the
hand
i
have
arranged
for
a
house
in
town
said
he
monsieur
rocheblave
has
refused
to
dine
with
me
there
will
you
do
me
that
honor
father
with
all
my
heart
your
excellency
said
father
gibault
and
turning
to
the
people
he
translated
what
the
colonel
had
said
then
their
cup
of
happiness
was
indeed
full
and
some
ran
to
clark
and
would
have
thrown
their
arms
about
him
had
he
been
a
man
to
embrace
hurrying
out
of
the
gate
they
spread
the
news
like
wildfire
and
presently
the
church
bell
clanged
in
tones
of
unmistakable
joy
sure
davy
dear
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
saints
day
at
home
said
terence
as
he
stood
leaning
against
a
picket
fence
that
bordered
the
street
savin
the
presence
of
the
naygurs
and
thim
red
divils
wid
blankets
an
scowls
as
wud
turrn
the
milk
sour
in
the
he
had
stopped
beside
two
kaskaskia
warriors
in
scarlet
blankets
who
stood
at
the
corner
watching
with
silent
contempt
the
antics
of
the
french
inhabitants
now
and
again
one
or
the
other
gave
a
grunt
and
wrapped
his
blanket
more
tightly
about
him
umrrhh
said
terence
faith
i
talk
that
langwidge
mesilf
when
i
have
the
warriors
stared
at
him
with
what
might
be
called
a
stoical
surprise

he
added
making
a
face
wid
muddy
wather
to
be
had
for
the
askin
we
moved
on
through
such
a
scene
as
i
have
seldom
beheld
the
village
had
donned
its
best
women
in
cap
and
gown
were
hurrying
hither
and
thither
some
laughing
and
some
weeping
grown
men
embraced
each
other
children
of
all
colors
flung
themselves
against
terence
s
legs
creoles
little
negroes
with
woolly
pates
and
naked
indian
lads
with
bow
and
arrow
terence
dashed
at
them
now
and
then
and
they
fled
screaming
into
dooryards
to
come
out
again
and
mimic
him
when
he
had
passed
while
mothers
and
fathers
and
grandfathers
smiled
at
the
good
nature
in
his
irish
face
presently
he
looked
down
at
me
comically
why
wuddent
ye
be
doin
the
like
davy
he
asked
amusha
tis
mesilf
that

to

and
hop
and

ye
put
me
in
mind
of
a
wizened
old
man
that
sat
all
day
makin
shoes
in
killarney
all
savin
the
fringe
he
had
on
his
a
soldier
must
be
dignified
i
answered
the
saints
bar
that
wurrd

said
terence
trying
to
pronounce
it
come
we
ll
go
to
mass
or
me
mother
will
be
visitin
me
this
we
crossed
the
square
and
went
into
the
darkened
church
where
the
candles
were
burning
it
was
the
first
church
i
had
ever
entered
and
i
heard
with
awe
the
voice
of
the
priest
and
the
fervent
responses
but
i
understood
not
a
word
of
what
was
said
afterwards
father
gibault
mounted
to
the
pulpit
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
raised
above
his
flock
and
then
began
to
speak
what
he
told
them
i
have
learned
since
and
this
i
know
that
when
they
came
out
again
into
the
sunlit
square
they
were
americans
it
matters
not
when
they
took
the
oath
as
we
walked
back
towards
the
fort
we
came
to
a
little
house
with
a
flower
garden
in
front
of
it
and
there
stood
colonel
clark
himself
by
the
gate
he
stopped
us
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
davy
said
he
we
are
to
live
here
for
a
while
you
and
i
what
do
you
think
of
our
headquarters
he
did
not
wait
for
me
to
reply
but
continued
can
you
suggest
any
improvement
you
will
be
needing
a
soldier
to
be
on
guard
in
front
sir
said
i
ah
said
the
colonel
mcchesney
is
too
valuable
a
man
i
am
sending
him
with
captain
bowman
to
take
would
you
have
terence
sir
i
ventured
while
terence
grinned
whereupon
colonel
clark
sent
him
to
report
to
his
captain
that
he
was
detailed
for
orderly
duty
to
the
commanding
officer
and
within
half
an
hour
he
was
standing
guard
in
the
flower
garden
making
grimaces
at
the
children
in
the
street
colonel
clark
sat
at
a
table
in
the
little
front
room
and
while
two
of
monsieur
rocheblave
s
negroes
cooked
his
dinner
he
was
busy
with
a
score
of
visitors
organizing
advising
planning
and
commanding
there
were
disputes
to
settle
now
that
alarm
had
subsided
and
at
noon
three
excitable
gentlemen
came
in
to
inform
against
a
certain
monsieur
cerre
merchant
and
trader
then
absent
at
louis
when
at
length
the
colonel
had
succeeded
in
bringing
their
denunciations
to
an
end
and
they
had
departed
he
looked
at
me
comically
as
i
stood
in
the
doorway
davy
said
he
all
i
ask
of
the
good
lord
is
that
he
will
frighten
me
incontinently
for
a
month
before
i
i
think
he
would
find
that
difficult
sir
i
answered
then
there
s
no
hope
for
me
he
answered
laughing
for
i
have
observed
that
fright
alone
brings
a
man
into
a
fit
spiritual
state
to
enter
heaven
what
would
you
say
of
those
slanderers
of
monsieur
cerre
not
expecting
an
answer
he
dipped
his
quill
into
the
and
turned
to
his
papers
i
should
say
that
they
owed
monsieur
cerre
money
i
replied
the
colonel
dropped
his
quill
and
stared
as
for
me
i
was
puzzled
to
know
why
egad
said
colonel
clark
most
of
us
get
by
hard
knocks
what
you
seem
to
have
been
born
he
fell
to
musing
a
worried
look
coming
on
his
face
that
was
no
stranger
to
me
later
and
his
hand
fell
heavily
on
the
loose
pile
of
paper
before
him
davy
says
he
i
need
a
what
would
that
be
sir
i
asked
a
john
law
who
will
make
something
out
of
nothing
who
will
make
money
out
of
this
blank
paper
who
will
wheedle
the
creole
traders
into
believing
they
are
doing
us
a
favor
and
making
their
everlasting
fortune
by
advancing
us
flour
and
and
doesn
t
congress
make
money
sir
i
asked
that
they
do
davy
by
the
ton
he
replied
and
so
must
we
as
the
rulers
of
a
great
province
for
mark
me
though
the
men
are
happy
in
four
days
they
will
be
grumbling
and
trying
to
desert
in
we
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
and
there
stood
terence
mccann
his
riverence
he
announced
and
bowed
low
as
the
priest
came
into
the
room
i
was
bid
by
colonel
clark
to
sit
down
and
dine
with
them
on
the
good
things
which
monsieur
rocheblave
s
cook
had
prepared
after
dinner
they
went
into
the
little
orchard
behind
the
house
and
sat
drinking
in
the
french
fashion
the
commandant
s
precious
coffee
which
had
been
sent
to
him
from
new
orleans
colonel
clark
plied
the
priest
with
questions
of
the
french
towns
under
english
rule
and
father
gibault
speaking
for
his
simple
people
said
that
the
english
had
led
them
easily
to
believe
that
the
kentuckians
were
cutthroats
ah
monsieur
he
said
if
they
but
knew
you
if
they
but
knew
the
principles
of
that
government
for
which
you
fight
they
would
renounce
the
english
allegiance
and
the
whole
of
this
territory
would
be
yours
i
know
them
from
quebec
to
detroit
and
michilimackinac
and
saint
vincennes
listen
monsieur
he
cried
his
homely
face
alight
i
myself
will
go
to
saint
vincennes
for
you
i
will
tell
them
the
truth
and
you
shall
have
the
post
for
the
you
will
go
to
vincennes
exclaimed
clark
a
hard
and
dangerous
journey
of
a
hundred
leagues
monsieur
answered
the
priest
simply
the
journey
is
nothing
for
a
century
the
missionaries
of
the
church
have
walked
this
wilderness
alone
with
god
often
they
have
suffered
and
often
died
in
tortures
but
colonel
clark
regarded
the
man
intently
the
cause
of
liberty
both
religious
and
civil
is
our
cause
father
gibault
continued
men
have
died
for
it
and
will
die
for
it
and
it
will
prosper
furthermore
monsieur
my
life
has
not
known
many
wants
i
have
saved
something
to
keep
my
old
age
with
which
to
buy
a
little
house
and
an
orchard
in
this
peaceful
place
the
sum
i
have
is
at
your
service
the
good
congress
will
repay
me
and
you
need
the
colonel
clark
was
not
an
impulsive
man
but
he
felt
none
the
less
deeply
as
i
know
well
his
reply
to
this
generous
offer
was
almost
brusque
but
it
did
not
deceive
the
priest
nay
monsieur
he
said
it
is
for
mankind
i
give
it
in
remembrance
of
him
who
gave
everything
and
though
i
receive
nothing
in
return
i
shall
have
my
reward
an
hundred
in
due
time
i
know
not
how
the
talk
swung
round
again
to
lightness
for
the
colonel
loved
a
good
story
and
the
priest
had
many
which
he
told
with
wit
in
his
quaint
french
accent
as
he
was
rising
to
take
his
leave
père
gibault
put
his
hand
on
my
head
i
saw
your
excellency
s
son
in
the
church
this
morning
he
said
colonel
clark
laughed
and
gave
me
a
pinch
my
dear
sir
he
said
the
boy
is
old
enough
to
be
my
the
priest
looked
down
at
me

his
brown
eyes

astonishment

the
young
colonel
s
face
clouded
god

he
said
father
gibault
dropped
his
eyes
and
turned
to
me
with
native
tact
what
would
you
like
best
to
do
my
son
he
asked
i
should
like
to

said
the
colonel
chapter
xv
days
of
trial
but
i
was
not
immediately
to
take
up
the
study
of
french
things
began
to
happen
in
kaskaskia
in
the
first
place
captain
bowman
s
company
with
a
few
scouts
of
which
tom
was
one
set
out
that
very
afternoon
for
the
capture
of
cohos
or
cahokia
and
this
despite
the
fact
that
they
had
had
no
sleep
for
two
nights
if
you
will
look
at
the
map
you
will
see
dotted
along
the
bottoms
and
the
bluffs
beside
the
great
mississippi
the
string
of
villages
kaskaskia
la
prairie
du
rocher
fort
chartres
philip
and
cahokia
some
few
miles
from
cahokia
on
the
western
bank
of
the
father
of
waters
was
the
little
french
village
of
louis
in
the
spanish
territory
of
louisiana
from
thence
eastward
stretched
the
great
waste
of
prairie
and
forest
inhabited
by
roving
bands
of
the
forty
indian
nations
then
you
come
to
vincennes
on
the
wabash
fort
vincent
the
english
and
canadians
called
it
for
there
were
a
few
of
the
latter
who
had
settled
in
kaskaskia
since
the
english
occupation
best
map
which
the
editor
has
found
of
this
district
is
in
vol
vi
part
of
winsor
s
narrative
and
critical
history
of
america
we
gathered
on
the
western
skirts
of
the
village
to
give
bowman
s
company
a
cheer
and
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
place
watched
the
little
column
as
it
wound
snakelike
over
the
prairie
on
the
road
to
fort
chartres
until
it
was
lost
in
the
cottonwoods
to
the
westward
things
began
to
happen
in
kaskaskia
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
things
had
not
happened
one
hundred
and
men
had
marched
into
that
territory
out
of
which
now
are
carved
the
great
states
of
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
and
to
most
of
them
the
thing
was
a
picnic
a
jaunt
which
would
soon
be
finished
many
had
left
families
in
the
frontier
forts
without
protection
the
time
of
their
enlistment
had
almost
expired
there
was
a
store
in
the
village
kept
by
a
great
citizen
not
a
citizen
of
kaskaskia
alone
but
a
citizen
of
the
world
this
i
am
aware
sounds
like
fiction
like
an
attempt
to
get
an
effect
which
was
not
there
but
it
is
true
as
gospel
the
owner
of
this
store
had
many
others
scattered
about
in
this
foreign
country
at
vincennes
at
louis
where
he
resided
at
cahokia
he
knew
michilimackinac
and
quebec
and
new
orleans
he
had
been
born
some
years
before
in
sardinia
had
served
in
the
spanish
army
and
was
still
a
spanish
subject
the
name
of
this
famous
gentleman
was
monsieur
françois
vigo
and
he
was
the
rothschild
of
the
country
north
of
the
ohio
monsieur
vigo
though
he
merited
it
i
had
not
room
to
mention
in
the
last
chapter
clark
had
routed
him
from
his
bed
on
the
morning
of
our
arrival
and
whether
or
not
he
had
been
in
the
secret
of
frightening
the
inhabitants
into
making
their
wills
and
then
throwing
them
into
transports
of
joy
i
know
not
monsieur
vigo
s
store
was
the
village
club
it
had
neither
glass
in
the
window
nor
an
attractive
display
of
goods
it
was
merely
a
log
cabin
set
down
on
a
weedy
plot
the
stuffy
smell
of
skins
and
furs
came
out
of
the
doorway
within
when
he
was
in
kaskaskia
monsieur
vigo
was
wont
to
sit
behind
his
rough
walnut
table
writing
with
a
fine
quill
or
dispensing
the
news
of
the
villages
to
the
priest
and
other
prominent
citizens
or
haggling
with
persistent
blanketed
braves
over
of
pelts
which
they
brought
down
from
the
green
forests
of
the
north
monsieur
vigo
s
clothes
were
the
color
of
the
tobacco
he
gave
in
exchange
his
eyes
were
not
unlike
the
black
beads
he
traded
but
shrewd
and
kindly
withal
set
in
a
square
saffron
face
that
had
the
contradiction
of
a
small
chin
as
the
days
wore
into
months
monsieur
vigo
s
place
very
naturally
became
the
headquarters
for
our
army
if
army
it
might
be
called
of
a
morning
a
dozen
would
be
sitting
against
the
logs
in
the
black
shadow
and
in
the
midst
of
them
always
squatted
an
unsavory
indian
squaw
a
few
braves
usually
stood
like
statues
at
the
corner
and
in
front
of
the
door
another
group
of
hunting
shirts
without
was
the
paper
money
of
the
continental
congress
within
the
good
tafia
and
tobacco
of
monsieur
vigo
one
day
monsieur
vigo
s
young
creole
clerk
stood
shrugging
his
shoulders
in
the
doorway
i
stopped
by
tam
swein
poulsson
was
crying
to
the
clerk
as
he
waved
a
worthless
scrip
above
his
head
vat

money
this
definition
the
clerk
not
being
a
doctor
johnson
was
unable
to
give
offhand
vat
are

demanded
poulsson
while
the
others
looked
on
some
laughing
some
serious
and
vich
citizen
are
you
since
you
are
ours
you
vill
please
to
give
me
one
carrot
of
and
he
thrust
the
scrip
under
the
clerk
s
nose
the
clerk
stared
at
the
uneven
lettering
on
the
scrip
with
disdain
money
he
exclaimed
scornfully
she

not
money
piastre
spanish
dollare
then
i
give

god
shouted
bill

cried
several
of
our
men
lem
me
in
here
said
cowan
but
the
frightened
creole
blocked
the
doorway
sacré
he
screamed
and
then
voleurs
the
excitement
drew
a
number
of
people
from
the
neighborhood
nay
it
seemed
as
if
the
whole
town
was
ringed
about
us
bravo
jules
they
cried
la
porte
à
bas
les
bostonnais
à
bas
les
voleurs
damn
such
monkey
talk
said
cowan
facing
them
suddenly
i
knew
him
well
and
when
the
giant
lost
his
temper
it
was
gone
irrevocably
until
a
fight
was
over
call
a
man
a
squar
hey
frenchy
another
of
our
men
put
in
stalking
up
to
the
clerk
i
reckon

tek

i
low
you
ll
give

the
rum
and
the
baccy
come
on
boys
in
between
him
and
the
clerk
leaped
a
little
man
with
a
red
waistcoat
beside
himself
with
rage
bill
cowan
and
his
friends
stared
at
this
diminutive
frenchman
as
he
poured
forth
a
veritable
torrent
of
unintelligible
words
plentifully
mixed
with
sacrés
which
he
ripped
out
like
snarls
i
would
as
soon
have
touched
him
as
a
ball
of
angry
bees
or
a
pair
of
fighting
wildcats
not
so
bill
cowan
when
that
worthy
recovered
from
his
first
surprise
he
seized
hold
of
some
of
the
man
s
twisting
arms
and
legs
and
lifted
him
bodily
from
the
ground
as
he
would
have
taken
a
perverse
and
struggling
child
there
was
no
question
of
a
fight
cowan
picked
him
up
i
say
and
before
any
one
knew
what
happened
he
flung
him
on
to
the
hot
roof
of
the
store
the
eaves
were
but
two
feet
above
his
head
and
there
the
man
stuck
clinging
to
a
loose
shingle
purpling
and
coughing
and
spitting
with
rage
there
was
a
loud
gust
of
guffaws
from
the
woodsmen
and
oaths
like
from
the
circle
around
us
menacing
growls
as
it
surged
inward
and
our
men
turned
to
face
it
a
few
citizens
pushed
through
the
outskirts
of
it
and
ran
away
and
in
the
hush
that
followed
we
heard
them
calling
wildly
the
names
of
father
gibault
and
clark
and
of
vigo
himself
cowan
thrust
me
past
the
clerk
into
the
store
where
i
stood
listening
to
the
little
man
on
the
roof
scratching
and
clutching
at
the
shingles
and
coughing
still
but
there
was
no
fight
shouts
of
monsieur
vigo
voici
monsieur
vigo
were
heard
the
crowd
parted
respectfully
and
monsieur
vigo
in
his
suit
stood
glancing
from
cowan
to
his
pallid
clerk
he
was
not
in
the
least
excited
come
in
my
frens
he
said
it
is
too
hot
in
the
and
he
set
the
example
by
stepping
over
the
sill
on
to
the
earth
of
the
floor
within
then
he
spied
me
ah
he
said
the
boy
of
monsieur
le
colonel
and
how
are
you
called
my
son
he
added
patting
me
kindly
davy
sir
i
answered
ha
he
said
and
a
brave
soldier
no
i
was
flattered
as
well
as
astonished
by
this
attention
but
monsieur
vigo
knew
men
and
he
had
given
them
time
to
turn
around
by
this
time
bill
cowan
and
some
of
my
friends
had
stooped
through
the
doorway
followed
by
a
prying
kaskaskian
brave
and
as
many
creoles
as
could
crowd
behind
them
monsieur
vigo
was
surprisingly
calm
it
make
hot
weather
my
frens
said
he
how
can
i
serve
you
messieurs
hain
t
the
congress
got
authority
here
said
one
i
am
happy
to
say
answered
monsieur
vigo
rubbing
his
hands
for
i
think
much
of
your
then
said
the
man
we
come
here
to
trade
with
congress
money
hain
t
that
money
good
in
kaskasky
there
was
an
anxious
pause
then
monsieur
vigo
s
eyes
twinkled
and
he
looked
at
me
and
what
you
say
davy
he
asked
the
money
would
be
good
if
you
took
it
sir
i
said
not
knowing
what
else
to
answer
sapristi
exclaimed
monsieur
vigo
looking
hard
at
me
who
teach
you
that
no
one
sir
said
i
staring
in
my
turn
and
if
congress
lose
and
not
pay
where
am
i
mon
petit
maître
de
la
haute
finance
demanded
monsieur
vigo
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
outward
you
will
be
in
good
company
sir
said
i
at
that
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
bill
cowan
and
my
friends
laughed
with
him
good
company
c
est
la
plupart
de
la
vie
said
monsieur
vigo
et
quel
garçon
what
a
boy
it
is
i
never
seed
his
beat
fer
wisdom
mister
vigo
said
bill
cowan
now
in
good
humor
once
more
at
the
prospect
of
rum
and
tobacco
and
i
found
out
later
that
he
and
the
others
had
actually
given
to
me
the
credit
of
this
coup
he
never
failed
us
yet
hain
t
that
truth
boys
hain
t
we
on
to
vincent
because
he
seen
the
ha
r
buyer
sculped
on
the
ohio
the
rest
assented
so
heartily
but
withal
so
gravely
that
i
am
between
laughter
and
tears
over
the
remembrance
of
it
at
noon
you
come
back
said
monsieur
vigo
i
think
till
then
about
rate
of
exchange
and
talk
with
your
colonel
davy
you
stay
i
remained
while
the
others
filed
out
and
at
length
i
was
alone
with
him
and
jules
his
clerk
davy
how
you
like
to
be
trader
asked
monsieur
vigo
it
was
a
new
thought
to
me
and
i
turned
it
over
in
my
mind
to
see
the
strange
places
of
the
world
and
the
stranger
people
to
become
a
man
of
wealth
and
influence
such
as
monsieur
vigo
and
i
fear
i
loved
it
best
to
match
my
brains
with
others
at
a
bargain
i
turned
it
all
over
slowly
gravely
in
my
boyish
mind
rubbing
the
hard
dirt
on
the
floor
with
the
toe
of
my
moccasin
and
suddenly
the
thought
came
to
me
that
i
was
a
traitor
to
my
friends
a
deserter
from
the
little
army
that
loved
me
so
well
eh
bien
said
monsieur
vigo
i
shook
my
head
but
in
spite
of
me
i
felt
the
tears
welling
into
my
eyes
and
brushed
them
away
shamefully
at
such
times
of
stress
some
of
my
paternal
scotch
crept
into
my
speech
i
will
no
be
leaving
colonel
clark
and
the
boys
i
cried
not
for
all
the
money
in
the
congress
money
said
monsieur
vigo
with
a
queer
expression
it
was
then
i
laughed
through
my
tears
and
that
cemented
the
friendship
between
us
it
was
a
lifelong
friendship
though
i
little
suspected
it
then
in
the
days
that
followed
he
never
met
me
on
the
street
that
he
did
not
stop
to
pass
the
time
of
day
and
ask
me
if
i
had
changed
my
mind
he
came
every
morning
to
headquarters
where
he
and
colonel
clark
sat
by
the
hour
with
brows
knit
monsieur
vigo
was
as
good
as
his
word
and
took
the
congress
money
though
not
at
such
a
value
as
many
would
have
had
him
i
have
often
thought
that
we
were
all
children
then
and
knew
nothing
of
the
ingratitude
of
republics
monsieur
vigo
took
the
money
and
was
all
his
life
many
many
thousand
dollars
the
poorer
father
gibault
advanced
his
little
store
and
lived
to
feel
the
pangs
of
want
and
colonel
clark
but
i
must
not
go
beyond
the
troubles
of
that
summer
and
the
problems
that
vexed
our
commander
one
night
i
missed
him
from
the
room
where
we
slept
and
walking
into
the
orchard
found
him
pacing
there
where
the
moon
cast
filmy
shadows
on
the
grass
by
day
as
he
went
around
among
the
men
his
brow
was
unclouded
though
his
face
was
stern
but
now
i
surprised
the
man
so
strangely
moved
that
i
yearned
to
comfort
him
he
had
taken
three
turns
before
he
perceived
me
davy
he
said
what
are
you
doing
here
i
missed
you
sir
i
answered
staring
at
the
furrows
in
his
face
come
he
said
almost
roughly
and
seizing
my
hand
led
me
back
and
forth
swiftly
through
the
wet
grass
for
i
know
not
how
long
the
moon
dipped
to
the
uneven
line
of
the
and
slipped
behind
the
stone
chimney
all
at
once
he
stopped
dropped
my
hand
and
smote
both
of
his
together
i
will
hold
on
by
the
eternal
he
cried
i
will
let
no
american
read
his
history
and
say
that
i
abandoned
this
land
let
them
desert
if
ten
men
be
found
who
will
stay
i
will
hold
the
place
for
the
will
not
virginia
and
the
congress
send
you
men
sir
i
asked
wonderingly
he
laughed
a
laugh
that
was
all
bitterness
virginia
and
the
continental
congress
know
little
and
care
less
about
me
he
answered
some
day
you
will
learn
that
foresight
sometimes
comes
to
men
but
never
to
assemblies
but
it
is
often
given
to
one
man
to
work
out
the
salvation
of
a
people
and
be
destroyed
for
it
davy
we
have
been
up
too
at
the
morning
parade
from
my
wonted
place
at
the
end
of
the
line
i
watched
him
with
astonishment
reviewing
the
troops
as
usual
for
the
very
first
day
i
had
crossed
the
river
with
terence
climbed
the
heights
to
the
old
fort
and
returned
with
my
drum
but
no
sooner
had
i
beaten
the
retreat
than
the
men
gathered
here
and
there
in
groups
that
smouldered
with
mutiny
and
i
noted
that
some
of
the
officers
were
amongst
these
once
in
a
while
a
sentence
like
a
flaming
brand
was
flung
out
their
time
was
up
their
wives
and
children
for
all
they
knew
sculped
by
the
red
varmints
and
by
the
etarnal
clark
or
no
man
living
could
keep
them
hi
said
one
as
i
passed
here
s
davy
with
his
drum
he
ll
be
leadin
us
back
to
kaintuck
in
the
ay
ay
cried
another
man
in
the
group
i
reckon
he
s
had
his
full
of
tyranny
i
stopped
my
face
blazing
red
shame
on
you
for
those
words
i
shouted
shrilly
shame
on
you
you
fools
to
desert
the
man
who
would
save
your
wives
and
children
how
are
the
redskins
to
be
beaten
if
they
are
not
cowed
in
their
own
country
for
i
had
learned
much
at
headquarters
they
stood
silent
astonished
no
doubt
at
the
sight
of
my
small
figure
with
anger
i
heard
bill
cowan
s
voice
behind
me
there
s
truth
for
ye
he
said
that
will
slink
home
when
a
thing
s
half
ye
needn
t
talk
bill
cowan
it
s
well
enough
for
ye
i
reckon
your
wife
d
scare
any
redskin
off
her
clearin
many
the
time
she
scart
me
said
bill
cowan
and
so
the
matter
went
by
with
a
laugh
but
the
grumbling
continued
and
the
danger
was
that
the
french
would
learn
of
it
the
day
passed
yet
the
embers
blazed
not
into
the
flame
of
open
mutiny
but
he
who
has
seen
service
knows
how
ominous
is
the
gathering
of
men
here
and
there
the
low
humming
talk
the
silence
when
a
dissenter
passes
there
were
fights
too
that
had
to
be
quelled
by
company
captains
and
no
man
knew
when
the
loud
quarrel
between
the
two
races
at
vigo
s
store
would
grow
into
an
ugly
battle
what
did
clark
intend
to
do
this
was
the
question
that
hung
in
the
minds
of
mutineer
and
faithful
alike
they
knew
the
desperation
of
his
case
without
money
save
that
which
the
generous
creoles
had
advanced
upon
his
personal
credit
without
apparent
resources
without
authority
save
that
which
the
weight
of
his
character
exerted
how
could
he
prevent
desertion
they
eyed
him
as
he
went
from
place
to
place
about
his
business
erect
thoughtful
undisturbed
few
men
dare
to
set
their
will
against
a
multitude
when
there
are
no
fruits
to
be
won
columbus
persisted
and
found
a
new
world
clark
persisted
and
won
an
empire
for
thoughtless
generations
to
enjoy
that
night
he
slept
not
at
all
but
sat
while
the
candles
flickered
in
their
sockets
poring
over
maps
and
papers
i
dared
not
disturb
him
but
lay
the
darkness
through
with
staring
eyes
and
when
the
windows
on
the
orchard
side
showed
a
gray
square
of
light
he
flung
down
the
parchment
he
was
reading
on
the
table
it
rolled
up
of
itself
and
he
pushed
back
his
chair
i
heard
him
call
my
name
and
leaping
out
of
bed
i
stood
before
him
you
sleep
lightly
davy
he
said
i
think
to
try
me
i
did
not
answer
fearing
to
tell
him
that
i
had
been
awake
watching
him
i
have
one
friend
at
least
said
the
colonel
you
have
many
sir
i
answered
as
you
will
find
when
the
time
the
time
has
come
said
he
i
shall
be
able
to
count
them
davy
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
now
sir
i
answered
overjoyed
as
soon
as
the
sun
strikes
that
orchard
he
said
pointing
out
of
the
window
you
have
learned
how
to
keep
things
to
yourself
now
i
want
you
to
impart
them
to
others
go
out
and
tell
the
village
that
i
am
going
that
you
are
going
away
sir
i
repeated
that
i
am
going
away
he
said
with
my
army
save
the
mark
with
my
army
and
my
drummer
boy
and
my
paper
money
such
is
my
faith
in
the
loyalty
of
the
good
people
of
these
villages
to
the
american
cause
that
i
can
safely
leave
the
flag
flying
over
their
heads
with
the
assurance
that
they
will
protect
i
stared
at
him
doubtfully
for
at
times
a
pleasantry
came
out
of
his
bitterness
ay
he
said
go
have
you
any
love
for
me
i
have
sir
i
answered
by
the
lord
i
believe
you
he
said
and
picking
up
my
small
hunting
shirt
he
flung
it
at
me
put
it
on
and
go
when
the
sun
as
the
first
shaft
of
light
over
the
bluff
revealed
the
diamonds
in
the
orchard
grass
i
went
out
wondering
suspecting
would
be
a
better
word
for
the
nature
i
had
inherited
but
i
had
my
orders
terence
was
pacing
the
garden
his
leggings
turned
black
with
the
dew
i
looked
at
him

a

disseminate
terence
the

going
back
to

i
answered
and
ran
on
davy
darlin
i
heard
him
calling
after
me
as
i
turned
the
corner
but
i
looked
not
back
there
was
a
single
sound
in
the
street
a
thin
bronzed
indian
lad
squatted
against
the
pickets
with
his
fingers
on
a
reed
his
cheeks
distended
he
broke
off
with
a
wild
mournful
note
to
stare
at
me
a
wisp
of
smoke
stole
from
a
stone
chimney
and
the
smell
that
and
bacon
leave
was
in
the
air
a
bolt
was
slammed
back
a
door
creaked
and
stuck
was
flung
open
and
with
a
va
t
en
méchant
a
urchin
was
cast
out
of
the
house
and
fled
into
the
dusty
street
breathing
the
morning
air
in
the
doorway
stood
a
young
woman
in
a
cotton
gown
a
saucepan
in
hand
she
had
inquisitive
eyes
a
pointed
prying
nose
and
i
knew
her
to
be
the
village
gossip
the
wife
of
jules
monsieur
vigo

clerk
she
had
the
same
smattering
of
english
as

she
stood
regarding

lids

said

repeated
whereupon
they
both
began
to
lament
and
why

other
inhabitants
came
in
varied
costumes
into
the
street
to
hear
the
news
lamenting
if
clark

day

judgment
was
at
hand

was

and

fled
up

street
with

and
then
i
made
my
way
to

the
men
were
gathering
about

talking

as

for

his

who
would
have

for
the
colonel

it
was
agreed
and
i
was
to
repeat
the
name
of
every
man
that
sent
me
departing
on
this
embassy
i
sped
out
of
the
gates
of
the
fort
but
as
i
approached
the
little
house
where
clark
lived
the
humming
of
a
crowd
came
to
my
ears
and
i
saw
with
astonishment
that
the
street
was
blocked
it
appeared
that
the
whole
of
the
inhabitants
of
kaskaskia
were
packed
in
front
of
the
place
wriggling
my
way
through
the
people
i
had
barely
reached
the
gate
when
i
saw
monsieur
vigo
and
the
priest
three
creole
gentlemen
in
uniform
and
several
others
coming
out
of
the
door
they
stopped
and
monsieur
vigo
raising
his
hand
for
silence
made
a
speech
in
french
to
the
people
what
he
said
i
could
not
understand
and
when
he
had
finished
they
broke
up
into
groups
and
many
of
them
departed
before
i
could
gain
the
house
colonel
clark
himself
came
out
with
captain
helm
and
captain
harrod
the
colonel
glanced
at
me
and
smiled
parade
davy
he
said
and
walked
on
i
ran
back
to
the
fort
and
when
i
had
gotten
my
drum
the
three
companies
were
falling
into
line
the
men
murmuring
in
undertones
among
themselves
they
were
brought
to
attention
colonel
clark
was
seen
to
come
out
of
the
commandant
s
house
and
we
watched
him
furtively
as
he
walked
slowly
to
his
place
in
front
of
the
line
a
tremor
of
excitement
went
from
sergeant
to
drummer
boy
the
sentries
closed
the
big
gates
of
the
fort
the
colonel
stood
for
a
full
minute
surveying
us
calmly
a
disquieting
way
he
had
when
matters
were
at
a
crisis
then
he
began
to
talk
i
have
heard
from
many
sources
that
you
are
dissatisfied
that
you
wish
to
go
back
to
kentucky
if
that
be
so
i
say
to
you
go
and
god
be
with
i
will
hinder
no
man
we
have
taken
a
brave
and
generous
people
into
the
fold
of
the
republic
and
they
have
shown
their
patriotism
by
giving
us
freely
of
their
money
and
he
raised
his
voice
they
have
given
the
last
proof
of
that
patriotism
this
day
yes
they
have
come
to
me
and
offered
to
take
your
places
to
finish
the
campaign
which
you
have
so
well
begun
and
wish
to
abandon
i
shall
enroll
their
militia
under
the
flag
for
which
you
have
when
he
had
ceased
speaking
a
murmur
ran
through
the
ranks
but
if
there
be
any
he
said
who
have
faith
in
me
and
in
the
cause
for
which
we
have
come
here
who
have
the
perseverance
and
the
courage
to
remain
i
will
reënlist
them
the
rest
of
you
shall
march
for
kentucky
he
cried
as
soon
as
captain
bowman
s
company
can
be
relieved
at
cahokia
the
regiment
is
for
a
moment
they
remained
in
ranks
as
though
stupefied
it
was
cowan
who
stepped
out
first
snatched
his
coonskin
hat
from
his
head
and
waved
it
in
the
air
huzzay
for
colonel
clark
he
roared
i
ll
foller
him
into
canady
and
stand
up
to
my
lick
they
surrounded
bill
cowan
not
the
twenty
which
had
flocked
to
him
in
the
morning
but
four
times
twenty
and
they
marched
in
a
body
to
the
commandant
s
house
to
be
reënlisted
the
colonel
stood
by
the
door
and
there
came
a
light
in
his
eyes
as
he
regarded
us
they
cheered
him
again
thank
you
lads
he
said
remember
we
may
have
to
whistle
for
our
damn
the
pay
cried
bill
cowan
and
we
echoed
the
sentiment
we
ll
see
what
can
be
done
about
land
grants
said
the
colonel
and
he
turned
away
at
dusk
that
evening
i
sat
on
the
back
by
the
orchard
cleaning
his
rifle
the
sound
of
steps
came
from
the
little
passage
behind
me
and
a
hand
was
on
my
head
davee
said
a
voice
it
was
monsieur
vigo
s
do
you
know
what
is
un
coup
d
état
no
ha
you
execute
one
is
it
not
so
monsieur
le
colonel
i
reckon
he
was
in
the
secret
said
colonel
clark
did
you
think
i
meant
to
leave
kaskaskia
davy
no
he
is
not
so
easy
fool
monsieur
vigo
put
in
he
tell
me
paper
money
good
if
i
take
it
c
est
la
haute

colonel
clark
laughed
and
why
didn
t
you
think
i
meant
to
leave
said
he
because
you
bade
me
go
out
and
tell
everybody
i
answered
what
you
really
mean
to
do
you
tell
no
nom
du
bon
dieu
exclaimed
monsieur
vigo
yesterday
colonel
clark
had
stood
alone
the
enterprise
for
which
he
had
risked
all
on
the
verge
of
failure
by
a
his
ranks
were
repleted
his
position
recovered
his
authority
secured
once
more
few
men
recognize
genius
when
they
see
it
monsieur
vigo
was
not
one
of
these
chapter
xvi
davy
goes
to
cahokia
i
should
make
but
a
poor
historian
for
i
have
not
stuck
to
my
chronology
but
as
i
write
the
vivid
recollections
are
those
that
i
set
down
i
have
forgotten
two
things
of
great
importance
first
the
departure
of
father
gibault
with
several
creole
gentlemen
and
a
spy
of
colonel
clark
s
for
vincennes
and
their
triumphant
return
in
august
the
sacrifice
of
the
good
priest
had
not
been
in
vain
and
he
came
back
with
the
joyous
news
of
a
peaceful
conquest
the
stars
and
stripes
now
waved
over
the
fort
and
the
french
themselves
had
put
it
there
and
the
vast
stretch
of
country
from
that
place
westward
to
the
father
of
waters
was
now
american
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
oversight
the
surprise
and
conquest
of
cahokia
by
bowman
and
his
men
was
like
that
of
kaskaskia
and
the
french
there
were
loyal
too
offering
their
militia
for
service
in
the
place
of
those
men
of
bowman
s
company
who
would
not
reënlist
these
came
to
kaskaskia
to
join
our
and
no
sooner
had
the
hundred
marched
out
of
the
gate
and
taken
up
their
way
for
kentucky
than
colonel
clark
began
the
drilling
of
the
new
troops
captain
leonard
helm
was
sent
to
take
charge
of
vincennes
and
captain
montgomery
set
out
across
the
mountains
for
williamsburg
with
letters
praying
the
governor
of
virginia
to
come
to
our
assistance
for
another
cloud
had
risen
in
the
horizon
another
problem
for
clark
to
face
of
greater
portent
than
all
the
others
a
messenger
from
captain
bowman
at
cohos
came
riding
down
the
street
on
a
scraggly
french
pony
and
pulled
up
before
headquarters
the
messenger
was
sergeant
thomas
mcchesney
and
his
long
legs
almost
reached
the
ground
on
either
side
of
the
little
beast
leaping
from
the
saddle
he
seized
me
in
his
arms
set
me
down
and
bade
me
tell
colonel
clark
of
his
arrival
it
was
a
sultry
august
morning
within
the
hour
colonel
clark
and
tom
and
myself
were
riding
over
the
dusty
trace
that
wound
westward
across
the
common
lands
of
the
village
which
was
known
as
the
fort
chartres
road
the
shimmered
in
the
distance
and
there
was
no
sound
in
plain
or
village
save
the
tinkle
of
a
cowbell
from
the
clumps
of
shade
colonel
clark
rode
twenty
paces
in
front
alone
his
head
bowed
with
thinking
they
re
coming
into
cahokia
as
thick
as
bees
out
n
a
gum
davy
said
tom
seems
like
there
s
thousands
of
em
nothin
will
do
em
but
they
must
see
the
colonel
the
varmints
and
they
ve
got
patience
they
ll
wait
thar
till
the
b
ars
git
fat
i
reckon
they
low
clark
s
got
the
armies
of
congress
behind
him
if
they
knowed
said
tom
with
a
chuckle
if
they
knowed
that
we
d
only
got
seventy
of
the
boys
and
some
hundred
frenchies
in
the
army
i
reckon
the
colonel
s
too
cute
for
the
savages
in
cahokia
were
as
the
leaves
of
the
forest
curiosity
that
mainspring
of
the
indian
character
had
brought
the
chiefs
big
and
little
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
the
great
captain
of
the
long
knives
in
vain
had
the
faithful
bowman
put
them
off
they
would
wait
clark
must
come
and
clark
was
coming
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
quail
at
such
a
crisis
for
the
crux
of
the
whole
matter
was
here
and
if
he
failed
to
impress
them
with
his
power
with
the
might
of
the
congress
for
which
he
fought
no
man
of
his
would
ever
see
kentucky
again
as
we
rode
through
the
bottom
under
the
pecan
trees
we
talked
of
polly
ann
tom
and
i
and
of
our
little
home
by
the
salt
river
far
to
the
southward
where
we
would
live
in
peace
when
the
campaign
was
over
tom
had
written
her
painfully
enough
an
affectionate
scrawl
which
he
sent
by
one
of
captain
linn
s
men
and
i
too
had
written
my
letter
had
been
about
tom
and
how
he
had
become
a
sergeant
and
what
a
favorite
he
was
with
bowman
and
the
colonel
poor
polly
ann
she
could
not
write
but
a
runner
from
harrodstown
who
was
a
friend
of
tom
s
had
carried
all
the
way
to
cahokia
in
the
pocket
with
his
despatches
a
fold
of
linen
tom
pulled
it
from
the
bosom
of
his
hunting
shirt
to
show
me
and
in
it
was
a
little
ring
of
hair
like
unto
the
finest
spun
this
was
the
message
polly
ann
had
sent
a
message
from
little
tom
as
well
at
prairie
du
rocher
at
philippe
the
inhabitants
lined
the
streets
to
do
homage
to
this
man
of
strange
power
who
rode
unattended
and
unafraid
to
the
council
of
the
savage
tribes
which
had
terrorized
his
people
of
kentucky
from
the
ramparts
of
fort
chartres
once
one
of
the
mighty
chain
of
strongholds
to
protect
a
new
france
and
now
deserted
like
massacre
i
gazed
for
the
first
time
in
awe
at
the
turgid
flood
of
the
mississippi
and
at
the
lands
of
the
spanish
king
beyond
with
never
ceasing
fury
the
river
tore
at
his
clay
banks
and
worried
the
green
islands
that
braved
his
charge
and
my
boyish
fancy
pictured
to
itself
the
monsters
which
might
lie
hidden
in
his
muddy
depths
we
lay
that
night
in
the
open
at
a
spring
on
the
bluffs
and
the
next
morning
beheld
the
church
tower
of
cahokia
a
little
way
from
the
town
we
perceived
an
odd
gathering
on
the
road
the
yellowed
and
weathered
hunting
shirts
of
bowman
s
company
mixed
with
the
motley
dress
of
the
creole
volunteers
some
of
these
gentlemen
wore
the
costume
of
coureurs
du
bois
others
had
odd
regimental
coats
and
hats
which
had
seen
much
service
besides
the
military
was
a
sober
deputation
of
citizens
and
hovering
behind
the
whole
a
horde
of
curious
blanketed
braves
come
to
get
a
first
glimpse
of
the
great
white
captain
so
escorted
we
crossed
at
the
mill
came
to
a
shady
street
that
faced
the
little
river
and
stopped
at
the
stone
house
where
colonel
clark
was
to
abide
on
that
day
and
for
many
days
more
that
street
was
thronged
with
warriors
chiefs
in
gala
dress
strutted
up
and
down
feathered
and
plumed
and
blanketed
smeared
with
paint
bedecked
with
rude
jewellery
earrings
and
bracelets
from
the
remote
forests
of
the
north
they
had
come
where
the
cold
winds
blow
off
the
blue
lakes
from
the
prairies
to
the
east
from
the
upper
running
waters
where
the
mississippi
flows
clear
and
undefiled
by
the
muddy
flood
from
the
villages
and
wigwams
of
the
sluggish
wabash
and
from
the
sandy
piny
country
between
the
great
northern
seas
where
michilimackinac
stands
guard
alone
sacs
and
foxes
chippeways
and
maumies
and
missesogies
puans
and
pottawattomies
chiefs
and
medicine
men
well
might
the
sleep
of
the
good
citizens
be
disturbed
and
the
women
fear
to
venture
to
the
creek
with
their
linen
and
their
paddles
the
lives
of
these
people
hung
in
truth
upon
a
slender
thing
the
bearing
of
one
man
all
day
long
the
great
chiefs
sought
an
audience
with
him
but
he
sent
them
word
that
matters
would
be
settled
in
the
council
that
was
to
come
all
day
long
the
warriors
lined
the
picket
fence
in
front
of
the
house
and
more
than
once
tom
mcchesney
roughly
shouldered
a
lane
through
them
that
timid
visitors
might
pass
like
a
pack
of
wolves
they
watched
narrowly
for
any
sign
of
weakness
as
for
tom
they
were
to
him
as
so
many
dogs
ye
varmints
he
cried
i
ll
take
a
blizz
rd
at
ye
if
ye
don
t
keep
the
way
at
that
they
would
give
back
grudgingly
with
a
chorus
of
grunts
only
to
close
in
again
as
tightly
as
before
but
they
came
to
have
a
wholesome
regard
for
the
man
with
the
red
hair
who
guarded
the
colonel
s
privacy
the
boy
who
sat
on
the
the
son
of
the
great
pale
face
chief
as
they
called
me
was
a
never
ending
source
of
comment
among
them
once
colonel
clark
sent
for
me
the
little
front
room
of
this
house
was
not
unlike
the
one
we
had
occupied
at
kaskaskia
it
had
bare
walls
a
plain
table
and
chairs
and
a
crucifix
in
the
corner
it
served
as
dining
room
parlor
bedroom
for
there
was
a
pallet
too
now
the
table
was
covered
with
parchments
and
papers
and
beside
colonel
clark
sat
a
grave
gentleman
of
about
his
own
age
as
i
came
into
the
room
colonel
clark
relaxed
turned
toward
this
gentleman
and
said
monsieur
gratiot
behold
my
my
strategist
my
and
monsieur
gratiot
smiled
he
struck
me
as
a
man
who
never
let
himself
go
sufficiently
to
laugh
ah
he
said
vigo
has
told
me
how
he
settled
the
question
of
paper
money
he
might
do
something
for
the
congress
in
the
davy
is
a
scotchman
like
john
law
said
the
colonel
and
he
is
a
master
at
perceiving
a
man
s
character
and
what
would
you
call
me
at
a
venture
davy
asked
monsieur
gratiot
he
spoke
excellent
english
with
only
a
slight
accent
a
citizen
of
the
world
like
monsieur
vigo
i
answered
at
a
hazard
pardieu
said
monsieur
gratiot
you
are
not
far
away
like
monsieur
vigo
i
keep
a
store
here
at
cahokia
like
monsieur
vigo
i
have
travelled
much
in
my
day
do
you
know
where
switzerland
is
davy
i
did
not
it
is
a
country
set
like
a
cluster
of
jewels
in
the
heart
of
europe
said
monsieur
gratiot
and
there
are
mountains
there
that
rise
amon
the
clouds
and
are
covered
with
perpetual
snows
and
when
the
sun
sets
on
those
snows
they
are
rubies
and
the
skies
above
them
i
was
born
amongst
the
mountains
sir
i
answered
my
pulse
quickening
at
his
description
but
they
were
not
so
high
as
those
you
speak
then
said
monsieur
gratiot
you
can
understand
a
little
my
sorrow
as
a
lad
when
i
left
it
from
switzerland
i
went
to
a
foggy
place
called
london
and
thence
i
crossed
the
ocean
to
the
solemn
forests
of
the
north
of
canada
where
i
was
many
years
learning
the
characters
of
these
gentlemen
who
are
looking
in
upon
and
he
waved
his
arm
at
the
line
of
peering
red
faces
by
the
pickets
monsieur
gratiot
smiled
at
clark
and
there
s
another
point
of
resemblance
between
myself
and
monsieur
have
you
taken
the
paper
money
i
demanded
monsieur
gratiot
slapped
his
linen
breeches
that
i
have
and
this
time
i
thought
he
was
going
to
laugh
but
he
did
not
though
his
eyes
sparkled
and
do
you
think
that
the
good
congress
will
ever
repay
me
davy
no
sir
said
i
peste
exclaimed
monsieur
gratiot
but
he
did
not
seem
to
be
offended
or
shaken
davy
said
colonel
clark
we
have
had
enough
of
predictions
fo
the
present
fetch
this
letter
to
captain
bowman
at
the
garrison
up
the
he
handed
me
the
letter
are
you
afraid
of
the
indians
if
i
were
sir
i
would
not
show
it
i
said
for
he
had
encouraged
me
to
talk
freely
to
him
avast
cried
the
colonel
as
i
was
going
out
and
why
not
if
i
show
that
i
am
not
afraid
of
them
sir
they
will
think
that
you
are
the
less
there
you
are
for
strategy
gratiot
said
colonel
clark
laughing
get
out
you
tom
was
more
concerned
when
i
appeared
don
t
pester
em
davy
said
he
fer
god
s
sake
don
t
pester
em
they
re
spoilin
fer
a
fight
stand
back
thar
ye
critters
he
shouted
brandishing
his
rifle
in
their
faces
ugh
i
reckon
it
wouldn
t
take
a
horse
or
a
dog
to
scent
ye
rank
b
ar
s
oil
kite
along
clutching
the
letter
tightly
i
slipped
between
the
narrowed
ranks
and
gained
the
middle
of
the
street
not
without
a
quickened
beat
of
my
heart
thence
i
sped
dodging
this
group
and
that
until
i
came
to
the
long
log
house
that
was
called
the
garrison
here
our
men
were
stationed
where
formerly
a
squad
from
an
english
regiment
was
quartered
i
found
captain
bowman
delivered
the
letter
and
started
back
again
through
the
brown
dusty
street
which
lay
in
the
shade
of
the
great
forest
trees
that
still
lined
it
doubling
now
and
again
to
avoid
an
idling
brave
that
looked
bent
upon
mischief
for
a
single
mischance
might
set
the
tide
running
to
massacre
i
was
nearing
the
gate
again
the
dust
flying
from
my
moccasined
feet
the
sight
of
the
stalwart
tom
giving
me
courage
again
suddenly
with
the
deftness
of
a
panther
an
indian
shot
forward
and
lifted
me
high
in
his
arms
to
this
day
i
recall
my
terror
as
i
dangled
in
staring
into
a
hideous
face
by
intuition
i
kicked
him
in
the
stomach
with
all
my
might
and
with
a
howl
of
surprise
and
rage
his
fingers
gripped
into
my
flesh
the
next
thing
i
remember
was
being
in
the
dust
suffocated
by
that
odor
which
he
who
has
known
it
can
never
forget
a
medley
of
discordant
cries
was
in
my
ears
then
i
was
snatched
up
bumped
against
heads
and
shoulders
and
deposited
somewhere
now
it
was
tom
s
face
that
was
close
to
mine
and
the
light
of
a
fierce
anger
was
in
his
blue
eyes
did
they
hurt
ye
davy
he
asked
i
shook
my
head
before
i
could
speak
he
was
at
the
gate
again
confronting
the
mob
of
savages
that
swayed
against
the
fence
and
the
street
was
filled
with
running
figures
a
voice
of
command
that
i
knew
well
came
from
behind
me
it
was
colonel
clark
s
stay
where
you
are
mcchesney
he
shouted
and
tom
halted
with
his
hand
on
the
latch
with
your
permission
i
will
speak
to
them
said
monsieur
gratiot
who
had
come
out
also
i
looked
up
at
him
and
he
was
as
calm
as
when
he
had
joked
with
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
very
well
said
clark
briefly
monsieur
gratiot
surveyed
them
scornfully
where
is
the
hungry
wolf
who
speaks
english
he
said
there
was
a
stir
in
the
rear
ranks
and
a
lean
savage
with
abnormal
cheek
bones
pushed
forward
hungry
wolf
here
he
said
with
a
grunt
the
hungry
wolf
knew
the
french
trader
at
michilimackinac
said
monsieur
gratiot
he
knows
that
the
french
trader
s
word
is
a
true
word
let
the
hungry
wolf
tell
his
companions
that
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
is
very
the
hungry
wolf
turned
and
began
to
speak
his
words
hoarse
and
resonant
seemed
to
come
from
the
depths
of
his
body
presently
he
paused
and
there
came
an
answer
from
the
fiend
who
had
seized
me
after
that
there
were
many
grunts
and
the
hungry
wolf
turned
again
the
north
wind
mean
no
harm
he
answered
he
play
with
the
son
of
the
great
white
chief
and
his
belly
is
very
sore
where
the
chief
s
son
kicked
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
will
consider
the
offence
said
monsieur
gratiot
and
retired
into
the
house
with
colonel
clark
for
a
full
five
minutes
the
indians
waited
impassive
and
then
monsieur
gratiot
reappeared
alone
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
is
mercifully
inclined
to
forgive
he
said
it
was
in
play
but
there
must
be
no
more
play
with
the
chief
s
son
and
the
path
to
the
great
chief
s
presence
must
be
kept
again
the
hungry
wolf
translated
the
north
wind
grunted
and
departed
in
silence
followed
by
many
of
his
friends
and
indeed
for
a
while
after
that
the
others
kept
a
passage
clear
to
the
gate
as
for
the
son
of
the
great
white
chief
he
sat
for
a
long
time
that
afternoon
beside
the
truck
patch
of
the
house
and
presently
he
slipped
out
by
a
byway
into
the
street
again
among
the
savages
his
heart
was
bumping
in
his
throat
but
a
boyish
reasoning
told
him
that
he
must
show
no
fear
and
that
day
he
found
what
his
colonel
had
long
since
learned
to
be
true
that
in
courage
is
the
greater
safety
the
power
of
the
great
white
chief
was
such
that
he
allowed
his
son
to
go
forth
alone
and
feared
not
for
his
life
even
so
clark
himself
walked
among
them
nor
looked
to
right
or
left
two
nights
colonel
clark
sat
through
calling
now
on
this
man
and
now
on
that
and
conning
the
treaties
which
the
english
had
made
with
the
various
tribes
ay
and
french
and
spanish
treaties
too
until
he
knew
them
all
by
heart
there
was
no
haste
in
what
he
did
no
uneasiness
in
his
manner
he
listened
to
the
advice
of
monsieur
gratiot
and
other
creole
gentlemen
of
weight
to
the
spanish
officers
who
came
in
their
regimentals
from
louis
out
of
curiosity
to
see
how
this
man
would
treat
with
the
tribes
for
he
spoke
of
his
intentions
to
none
of
them
and
gained
the
more
respect
by
it
within
the
week
the
council
began
and
the
scene
of
the
great
drama
was
a
field
near
the
village
the
background
of
forest
trees
few
plays
on
the
world
s
stage
have
held
such
suspense
few
battles
such
excitement
for
those
who
watched
here
was
the
spectacle
of
one
strong
man
s
brain
pitted
against
the
combined
craft
of
the
wilderness
in
the
midst
of
a
stretch
of
waving
grass
was
a
table
and
a
young
man
of
sat
there
alone
around
him
were
ringed
the
gathered
tribes
each
chief
in
the
order
of
his
importance
squatted
in
the
inner
circle
their
blankets
making
patches
of
bright
color
against
the
green
behind
the
tribes
was
the
little
group
of
hunting
shirts
the
men
leaning
on
the
barrels
of
their
long
rifles
indolent
but
watchful
here
and
there
a
gay
uniform
of
a
spanish
or
creole
officer
and
behind
these
all
the
population
of
the
village
that
dared
to
show
itself
the
ceremonies
began
with
the
kindling
of
the
council
fire
a
rite
handed
down
through
unknown
centuries
of
indian
usage
by
it
nations
had
been
made
and
unmade
broad
lands
passed
even
as
they
now
might
pass
the
yellow
of
its
crackling
flames
was
shamed
by
the
summer
sun
and
the
black
smoke
of
it
was
wafted
by
the
south
wind
over
the
forest
then
for
three
days
the
chiefs
spoke
and
a
man
listened
unmoved
the
sound
of
these
orations
wild
and
fearful
to
my
boyish
ear
comes
back
to
me
now
yet
there
was
a
cadence
in
it
a
music
of
notes
now
falling
now
rising
to
a
passion
and
intensity
that
thrilled
us
bad
birds
flying
through
the
land
the
british
agents
had
besought
them
to
take
up
the
bloody
hatchet
they
had
sinned
they
had
listened
to
the
lies
which
the
bad
birds
had
told
of
the
big
knives
they
had
taken
their
presents
but
now
the
great
spirit
in
his
wisdom
had
brought
themselves
and
the
chief
of
the
big
knives
together
therefore
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
they
stamped
on
the
bloody
belt
and
rent
in
pieces
the
emblems
of
the
white
king
across
the
water
so
said
the
interpreters
as
the
chiefs
one
after
another
tore
the
miniature
british
flags
which
had
been
given
them
into
bits
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
the
white
chief
rose
in
his
chair
gazing
haughtily
about
him
there
was
a
deep
silence
tell
your
chiefs
he
said
tell
your
chiefs
that
i
will
give
them
an
answer
and
upon
the
manner
in
which
they
receive
that
answer
depends
the
fate
of
your
nations
good
they
rose
and
thronging
around
him
sought
to
take
his
hand
but
clark
turned
from
them
peace
is
not
yet
come
he
said
sternly
it
is
time
to
take
the
hand
when
the
heart
is
given
with
a
feathered
headsman
of
one
of
the
tribes
gave
back
with
dignity
and
spoke
it
is
well
said
by
the
great
chief
of
the
pale
faces
he
answered
these
in
truth
are
not
the
words
of
a
man
with
a
double
so
they
sought
their
quarters
for
the
night
and
suspense
hung
breathless
over
the
village
there
were
many
callers
at
the
stone
house
that
evening
spanish
officers
creole
gentlemen
an
english
canadian
trader
or
two
with
my
elbow
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
i
watched
them
awhile
listening
with
a
boy
s
eagerness
to
what
they
had
to
say
of
the
day
s
doings
they
disputed
amongst
themselves
in
various
degrees
of
english
as
to
the
manner
of
treating
the
red
man
now
gesticulating
now
threatening
now
seizing
a
rolled
parchment
treaty
from
the
table
clark
sat
alone
a
little
apart
silent
save
a
word
now
and
then
in
a
low
tone
to
monsieur
gratiot
or
captain
bowman
here
was
an
odd
assortment
of
the
races
which
had
overrun
the
new
world
at
intervals
some
disputant
would
pause
in
his
talk
to
kill
a
mosquito
or
fight
away
a
moth
or
a
but
presently
the
argument
reached
such
a
pitch
that
the
mosquitoes
fed
undisturbed
you
have
done
much
sir
said
the
spanish
commandant
of
louis
but
the
savage
he
will
never
be
content
without
present
he
will
never
be
won
without
clark
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
perforce
listened
to
when
they
begin
to
speak
captain
de
leyba
said
he
i
know
not
what
may
be
the
present
policy
of
his
spanish
majesty
with
mcgillivray
and
his
creeks
in
the
south
but
this
i
do
believe
and
he
brought
down
his
fist
among
the
papers
that
the
old
french
and
spanish
treaties
were
right
in
principle
here
are
copies
of
the
english
treaties
that
i
have
secured
and
in
them
thousands
of
sovereigns
have
been
thrown
away
they
are
so
much
waste
paper
gentlemen
the
indians
are
children
if
you
give
them
presents
they
believe
you
to
be
afraid
of
them
i
will
deal
with
them
without
presents
and
if
i
had
the
gold
of
the
bank
of
england
stored
in
the
garrison
there
they
should
not
touch
a
piece
of
but
captain
de
leyba
incredulous
raised
his
eyebrows
and
shrugged
por
dios
he
cried
whoever
hear
of
one
man
and
fifty
militia
subduing
the
northern
tribes
without
a
piastre
after
a
while
the
colonel
called
me
in
and
sent
me
speeding
across
the
little
river
with
a
note
to
a
certain
brady
whose
house
was
not
far
away
like
many
another
citizen
of
cahokia
brady
was
a
party
of
young
puan
bucks
had
decreed
it
to
be
their
pleasure
to
encamp
in
brady
s
yard
to
peer
through
the
shutters
into
brady
s
house
to
enjoy
themselves
by
annoying
brady
s
family
and
others
as
much
as
possible
during
the
indian
occupation
of
cahokia
this
band
had
gained
a
reputation
for
mischief
and
chief
among
them
was
the
north
wind
himself
whom
i
had
done
the
honor
to
kick
in
the
stomach
they
had
made
a
fire
in
this
brady
s
over
which
they
were
cooking
venison
steaks
and
as
i
reached
the
door
the
north
wind
spied
me
grinned
rubbed
his
stomach
made
a
false
dash
at
me
that
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
and
finally
went
through
the
pantomime
of
scalping
me
i
stood
looking
at
him
with
my
legs
apart
for
the
son
of
the
great
chief
must
not
run
away
and
i
marked
that
the
north
wind
had
two
great
ornamental
daubs
like
painted
on
his
cheeks
i
sniffed
preparation
too
on
his
followers
and
i
was
sure
they
were
getting
ready
for
some
new
deviltry
i
handed
the
note
to
brady
through
the
crack
of
the
door
that
he
vouchsafed
to
me
and
when
he
had
slammed
and
bolted
me
out
i
ran
into
the
street
and
stood
for
some
time
behind
the
trunk
of
a
big
hickory
watching
the
followers
of
the
north
wind
some
were
painting
themselves
others
cleaning
their
rifles
and
sharpening
their
scalping
knives
all
jabbered
unceasingly
now
and
again
a
silent
brave
passed
paused
a
moment
to
survey
them
gravely
grunted
an
answer
to
something
they
would
fling
at
him
and
went
on
at
length
arrived
three
chiefs
whom
i
knew
to
be
high
in
the
councils
the
north
wind
came
out
to
them
and
the
four
blanketed
forms
stood
silhouetted
between
me
and
the
fire
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
by
this
time
i
was
sure
of
a
plot
and
fled
away
to
another
tree
for
fear
of
detection
at
length
stalked
through
the
street
the
hungry
wolf
the
interpreter
i
knew
this
man
to
be
friendly
to
clark
and
i
acted
on
impulse
he
gave
a
grunt
of
surprise
when
i
halted
before
him
i
made
up
my
mind
the
son
of
the
great
chief
knows
that
the
puans
have
wickedness
in
their
hearts
i
said
the
tongue
of
the
hungry
wolf
does
not
the
big
indian
drew
back
with
another
grunt
and
the
distant
firelight
flashed
on
his
eyes
as
on
polished
black
flints
umrrhh
is
the
pale
face
chief
s
son
a
prophet
the
anger
of
the
pale
face
chief
and
of
his
countrymen
is
as
the
hurricane
i
said
scarce
believing
my
own
ears
for
a
lad
is
imitative
by
nature
and
i
had
not
listened
to
the
interpreters
for
three
days
without
profit
the
hungry
wolf
grunted
again
after
which
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
then
he
said
let
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
have
guard
and
suddenly
he
was
gone
into
the
darkness
i
waded
the
creek
and
sped
to
clark
he
was
alone
now
the
shutters
of
the
room
closed
and
as
i
came
in
i
could
scarce
believe
that
he
was
the
same
masterful
man
i
had
seen
at
the
council
that
day
and
at
the
conference
an
hour
gone
he
was
once
more
the
friend
at
whose
feet
i
sat
in
private
who
talked
to
me
as
a
companion
and
a
father
where
have
you
been
davy
he
asked
and
then
what
is
it
my
lad
i
crept
close
to
him
and
told
him
in
a
breathless
undertone
and
i
knew
that
i
was
shaking
the
while
he
listened
gravely
and
when
i
had
finished
laid
a
firm
hand
on
my
head
there
he
said
you
are
a
brave
lad
and
a
he
thought
a
minute
his
hand
still
resting
on
my
head
and
then
rose
and
led
me
to
the
back
door
of
the
house
it
was
near
midnight
and
the
sounds
of
the
place
were
stilling
the
crickets
chirping
in
the
grass
run
to
captain
bowman
and
tell
him
to
send
ten
men
to
this
door
but
they
must
come
man
by
man
to
escape
detection
do
you
understand
i
nodded
and
was
starting
but
he
still
held
me
god
bless
you
davy
you
are
a
brave
he
closed
the
door
softly
and
i
sped
away
my
moccasins
making
no
sound
on
the
soft
dirt
i
reached
the
garrison
was
challenged
by
jack
terrill
the
guard
and
brought
by
him
to
bowman
s
room
the
captain
sat
undressed
at
the
edge
of
his
bed
but
he
was
a
man
of
action
and
strode
into
the
long
room
where
his
company
was
sleeping
and
gave
his
orders
without
delay
half
an
hour
later
there
was
no
light
in
the
village
the
colonel
s
headquarters
were
dark
but
in
the
kitchen
a
dozen
tall
men
were
waiting
chapter
xvii
the
sacrifice
so
far
as
the
world
knew
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
slept
peacefully
in
his
house
and
such
was
his
sense
of
power
that
not
even
a
sentry
paced
the
street
without
for
by
these
things
is
the
indian
mind
impressed
in
the
tiny
kitchen
a
dozen
men
and
a
boy
tried
to
hush
their
breathing
and
sweltered
for
it
was
very
hot
and
the
odor
of
past
cookings
was
stifling
to
men
used
to
the
open
in
a
corner
hooded
under
a
box
was
a
lighted
lantern
and
tom
mcchesney
stood
ready
to
seize
it
at
the
first
alarm
on
such
occasions
the
current
of
time
runs
sluggish
thrice
our
muscles
were
startled
into
tenseness
by
the
baying
of
a
hound
and
once
a
cock
crew
out
of
all
season
for
the
night
was
cloudy
and
pitchy
black
and
the
dawn
as
far
away
as
eternity
suddenly
i
knew
that
every
man
in
the
room
was
on
the
alert
for
the
skilled
frontiersman
when
watchful
has
a
sixth
sense
none
of
them
might
have
told
you
what
he
had
heard
the
next
sound
was
the
faint
creaking
of
colonel
clark
s
door
as
it
opened
wrapping
a
blanket
around
the
lantern
tom
led
the
way
and
we
massed
ourselves
behind
the
front
door
another
breathing
space
and
then
the
of
the
puans
broke
hideously
on
the
night
and
children
woke
crying
from
their
sleep
in
two
bounds
our
little
detachment
was
in
the
street
the
fire
spouting
red
from
the
deckards
faint
shadowy
forms
fading
along
the
line
of
trees
after
that
an
uproar
of
awakening
cries
here
and
there
a
drum
beating
madly
for
the
militia
the
dozen
flung
themselves
across
the
stream
i
hot
in
their
wake
through
brady
s
gate
which
was
open
and
there
was
a
scene
of
sweet
tranquillity
under
the
lantern
s
rays
the
north
wind
and
his
friends
wrapped
in
their
blankets
and
sleeping
the
sleep
of
the
just
damn
the
sly
varmints
cried
tom
and
he
turned
over
the
north
wind
with
his
foot
as
a
log
with
a
grunt
of
fury
the
indian
shed
his
blanket
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
stood
glaring
at
us
through
his
paint
but
suddenly
he
met
the
fixed
sternness
of
clark
s
gaze
and
his
own
shifted
by
this
time
his
followers
were
up
the
north
wind
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
in
token
of
his
innocence
and
then
spread
his
palms
outward
where
was
the
proof
look
i
cried
quivering
with
excitement
look
their
leggings
and
moccasins
are
wet
there
s
no
devil
if
they
beant
said
tom
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
approval
from
the
other
men
the
boy
is
right
said
the
colonel
and
turned
to
tom
sergeant
have
the
chiefs
put
in
he
swung
on
his
heel
and
without
more
ado
went
back
to
his
house
to
bed
the
north
wind
and
two
others
were
easily
singled
out
as
the
leaders
and
were
straightway
escorted
to
the
garrison
house
their
air
of
injured
innocence
availing
them
not
a
whit
the
militia
was
dismissed
and
the
village
was
hushed
once
more
but
all
night
long
the
chiefs
went
to
and
fro
taking
counsel
among
themselves
what
would
the
chief
of
the
pale
faces
do
the
morning
came
with
a
cloudy
damp
dawning
within
a
decent
time
for
the
indian
is
decorous
blanketed
deputations
filled
the
archways
under
the
trees
and
waited
there
as
the
minutes
ran
into
hours
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
surveyed
the
morning
from
his
and
his
eyes
rested
on
a
solemn
figure
at
the
gate
it
was
the
hungry
wolf
sorrow
was
in
his
voice
and
he
bore
messages
from
the
twenty
great
chiefs
who
stood
beyond
they
were
come
to
express
their
abhorrence
of
the
night
s
doings
of
which
they
were
as
innocent
as
the
deer
of
the
forest
let
the
hungry
wolf
tell
the
chiefs
said
colonel
clark
briefly
that
the
council
is
the
place
for
and
he
went
back
into
the
house
again
then
he
bade
me
run
to
captain
bowman
with
an
order
to
bring
the
north
wind
and
his
confederates
to
the
council
field
in
irons
the
day
followed
the
promise
of
the
dawn
the
clouds
hung
low
and
now
and
again
great
drops
struck
the
faces
of
the
people
in
the
field
and
like
the
heavens
the
assembly
itself
was
charged
with
we
knew
not
what
was
it
peace
or
war
as
before
a
white
man
sat
with
supreme
indifference
at
a
table
and
in
front
of
him
three
most
unhappy
chiefs
squatted
in
the
grass
the
shame
of
their
irons
hidden
under
the
blanket
folds
audacity
is
truly
a
part
of
the
equipment
of
genius
to
have
rescued
the
north
wind
and
his
friends
would
have
been
child
s
play
to
have
retired
from
the
council
with
threats
of
war
as
easy
and
yet
they
craved
pardon
one
chief
after
another
rose
with
dignity
in
the
ring
and
came
to
the
table
to
plead
an
argument
deserving
mention
was
that
the
north
wind
had
desired
to
test
the
friendship
of
the
french
for
the
big
knives
set
forth
without
a
smile
to
all
pleaders
colonel
clark
shook
his
head
he
being
a
warrior
cared
little
whether
such
people
were
friends
or
foes
he
held
them
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
at
length
they
came
no
more
the
very
clouds
seemed
to
hang
motionless
when
he
rose
to
speak
and
you
who
will
may
read
in
his
memoir
what
he
said
the
hungry
wolf
caught
the
spirit
of
it
and
was
eloquent
in
his
own
tongue
and
no
word
of
it
was
lost
first
he
told
them
of
the
causes
of
war
of
the
thirteen
council
fires
with
the
english
and
in
terms
that
the
indian
mind
might
grasp
and
how
their
old
father
the
french
king
had
joined
the
big
knives
in
this
righteous
fight
warriors
said
he
here
is
a
bloody
belt
and
a
white
one
take
which
you
choose
but
behave
like
men
should
it
be
the
bloody
path
you
may
leave
this
town
in
safety
to
join
the
english
and
we
shall
then
see
which
of
us
can
stain
our
shirts
with
the
most
blood
but
should
it
be
the
path
of
peace
as
brothers
of
the
big
knives
and
of
their
friends
the
french
and
then
you
go
to
your
homes
and
listen
to
the
bad
birds
you
will
then
no
longer
deserve
to
be
called
men
and
warriors
but
creatures
of
two
tongues
which
ought
to
be
destroyed
let
us
then
part
this
evening
in
the
hope
that
the
great
spirit
will
bring
us
together
again
with
the
sun
as
so
the
council
broke
up
white
man
and
red
went
trooping
into
town
staring
curiously
at
the
guard
which
was
leading
the
north
wind
and
his
friends
to
another
night
of
meditation
what
their
fate
would
be
no
man
knew
many
thought
the
tomahawk
that
night
the
citizens
of
the
little
village
of
pain
court
as
louis
was
called
might
have
seen
the
sky
reddened
in
the
eastward
it
was
the
loom
of
many
fires
at
cahokia
and
around
them
the
chiefs
of
the
forty
tribes
all
save
the
three
in
durance
vile
were
gathered
in
solemn
talk
would
they
take
the
bloody
belt
or
the
white
one
no
man
cared
so
little
as
the
pale
face
chief
when
their
eyes
were
turned
from
the
fitful
blaze
of
the
logs
the
gala
light
of
many
candles
greeted
them
and
above
the
sound
of
their
own
speeches
rose
the
merrier
note
of
the
fiddle
the
garrison
windows
shone
like
lanterns
and
behind
these
creole
and
backwoodsman
swung
the
village
ladies
in
the
gay
french
dances
the
man
at
whose
bidding
this
merrymaking
was
held
stood
in
a
corner
watching
with
folded
arms
and
none
to
look
at
him
might
know
that
he
was
playing
for
a
stake
the
troubled
fires
of
the
indians
had
died
to
embers
long
before
the
candles
were
snuffed
in
the
garrison
house
and
the
music
ceased
the
sun
himself
was
pleased
to
hail
that
last
morning
of
the
great
council
and
beamed
with
torrid
tolerance
upon
the
ceremony
of
kindling
the
greatest
of
the
fires
on
this
morning
colonel
clark
did
not
sit
alone
but
was
surrounded
by
men
of
weight
by
monsieur
gratiot
and
other
citizens
captain
bowman
and
the
spanish
officers
and
when
at
length
the
brush
crackled
and
the
flames
caught
the
logs
three
of
the
mightiest
chiefs
arose
the
greatest
victor
in
fifty
tribal
wars
held
in
his
hand
the
white
belt
of
peace
the
second
bore
a
pipe
with
a
huge
bowl
and
after
him
with
measured
steps
a
third
came
with
a
smoking
censer
the
sacred
fire
with
which
to
kindle
the
pipe
halting
before
clark
he
first
swung
the
censer
to
the
heavens
then
to
the
earth
then
to
all
the
spirits
of
the
air
calling
these
to
witness
that
peace
was
come
at
last
and
finally
to
the
chief
of
the
long
knives
and
to
the
gentlemen
of
dignity
about
his
person
next
the
indian
turned
and
spoke
to
his
brethren
in
measured
sonorous
tones
he
bade
them
thank
that
great
spirit
who
had
cleared
the
sky
and
opened
their
ears
and
hearts
that
they
might
receive
the
truth
who
had
laid
bare
to
their
understanding
the
lies
of
the
english
even
as
these
english
had
served
the
big
knives
so
might
they
one
day
serve
the
indians
therefore
he
commanded
them
to
cast
the
tomahawk
into
the
river
and
when
they
should
return
to
their
land
to
drive
the
evil
birds
from
it
and
they
must
send
their
wise
men
to
kaskaskia
to
hear
the
words
of
wisdom
of
the
great
white
chief
clark
he
thanked
the
great
spirit
for
this
council
fire
which
he
had
kindled
at
cahokia
lifting
the
bowl
of
the
censer
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
people
he
drew
in
a
long
whiff
to
bear
witness
of
peace
after
him
the
pipe
went
the
interminable
rounds
of
the
chiefs
colonel
clark
took
it
and
puffed
captain
bowman
puffed
everybody
puffed
davy
must
have
a
pull
cried
tom
and
even
the
chiefs
smiled
as
i
coughed
and
sputtered
while
my
friends
roared
with
laughter
it
gave
me
no
great
notion
of
the
fragrance
of
tobacco
and
then
came
such
a
and
grunting
as
a
man
rarely
sees
in
a
lifetime
there
was
but
one
disquieting
question
left
what
was
to
become
of
the
north
wind
and
his
friends
none
dared
mention
the
matter
at
such
a
time
but
at
length
as
the
day
wore
on
to
afternoon
the
colonel
was
seen
to
speak
quietly
to
captain
bowman
and
several
backwoodsmen
went
off
toward
the
town
and
presently
a
silence
fell
on
the
company
as
they
beheld
the
dejected
three
crossing
the
field
with
a
guard
they
were
led
before
clark
and
when
he
saw
them
his
face
hardened
to
sternness
it
is
only
women
who
watch
to
catch
a
bear
sleeping
he
said
the
big
knives
do
not
kill
women
i
shall
give
you
meat
for
your
journey
home
for
women
can
not
hunt
if
you
remain
here
you
shall
be
treated
as
squaws
set
the
women
tom
mcchesney
cast
off
their
irons
as
for
clark
he
began
to
talk
immediately
with
monsieur
gratiot
as
though
he
had
dismissed
them
from
his
mind
and
their
agitation
was
a
pitiful
thing
to
see
in
vain
they
pressed
about
him
in
vain
they
even
pulled
the
fringe
of
his
shirt
to
gain
his
attention
and
then
they
went
about
among
the
other
chiefs
but
these
dared
not
intercede
uneasiness
was
written
on
every
man
s
face
and
the
talk
went
haltingly
but
clark
was
serenity
itself
at
length
with
a
supreme
effort
they
plucked
up
courage
to
come
again
to
the
table
one
holding
out
the
belt
of
peace
and
the
other
the
still
smouldering
pipe
clark
paused
in
his
talk
he
took
the
belt
and
flung
it
away
over
the
heads
of
those
around
him
he
seized
the
pipe
and
taking
up
his
sword
from
the
table
drew
it
and
with
one
blow
clave
the
stem
in
half
there
was
no
anger
in
either
act
but
much
deliberation
the
big
knives
he
said
scornfully
do
not
treat
with
the
pleading
began
again
the
hungry
wolf
interpreting
with
tremors
of
earnestness
their
lives
were
spared
but
to
what
purpose
since
the
white
chief
looked
with
disfavor
upon
them
let
him
know
that
bad
men
from
michilimackinac
put
the
deed
into
their
hearts
when
the
big
knives
come
upon
such
people
in
the
wilderness
clark
answered
they
shoot
them
down
that
they
may
not
eat
the
deer
but
they
have
never
talked
of
he
turned
from
them
once
more
they
went
away
in
a
dejection
to
wring
our
compassion
and
we
thought
the
matter
ended
at
last
the
sun
was
falling
low
the
people
beginning
to
move
away
when
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
culprits
were
seen
coming
back
again
with
them
were
two
young
men
of
their
own
nation
the
indians
opened
up
a
path
for
them
to
pass
through
and
they
came
as
men
go
to
the
grave
so
mournful
so
impressive
withal
that
the
crowd
fell
into
silence
again
and
the
colonel
turned
his
eyes
the
two
young
men
sank
down
on
the
ground
before
him
and
shrouded
their
heads
in
their
blankets
what
is
this
clark
demanded
the
north
wind
spoke
in
a
voice
of
sorrow
an
atonement
to
the
great
white
chief
for
the
sins
of
our
nation
perchance
the
great
chief
will
deign
to
strike
a
tomahawk
into
their
heads
that
our
nation
may
be
saved
in
war
by
the
big
and
the
north
wind
held
forth
the
pipe
once
more
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
said
clark
still
they
stood
irresolute
their
minds
now
bereft
of
expedients
and
the
young
men
sat
motionless
on
the
ground
as
clark
talked
they
peered
out
from
under
their
blankets
once
twice
thrice
he
was
still
talking
to
the
wondering
monsieur
gratiot
but
no
other
voice
was
heard
and
the
eyes
of
all
were
turned
on
him
in
amazement
but
at
last
when
the
drama
had
risen
to
the
pitch
of
unbearable
suspense
he
looked
down
upon
the
two
miserable
pyramids
at
his
feet
and
touched
them
the
blankets
quivered
stand
up
said
the
colonel
and
they
rose
cast
the
blankets
from
them
and
stood
with
a
stoic
dignity
awaiting
his
pleasure
wonderful
men
they
were
and
for
the
first
time
clark
s
eyes
were
seen
to
kindle
i
thank
the
great
spirit
said
he
in
a
loud
voice
that
i
have
found
men
among
your
nation
that
i
have
at
last
discovered
the
real
chiefs
of
your
people
had
they
sent
such
as
you
to
treat
with
me
in
the
beginning
all
might
have
been
well
go
back
to
your
people
as
their
chiefs
and
tell
them
that
through
you
the
big
knives
have
granted
peace
to
your
stepping
forward
he
grasped
them
each
by
the
hand
and
despite
training
joy
shone
in
their
faces
while
a
murmur
arose
from
the
assemblage
but
clark
did
not
stop
there
he
presented
them
to
captain
bowman
and
to
the
french
and
spanish
gentlemen
present
and
they
were
hailed
by
their
own
kind
as
chiefs
of
their
nation
to
cap
it
all
our
troops
backwoodsmen
and
creole
militia
paraded
in
line
on
the
common
and
fired
a
salute
in
their
honor
thus
did
clark
gain
the
friendship
of
the
forty
tribes
in
the
northwest
country
chapter
xviii
an
ye
had
been
where
i
had
been
we
went
back
to
kaskaskia
colonel
clark
tom
and
myself
and
a
great
weight
was
lifted
from
our
hearts
a
peaceful
autumn
passed
and
we
were
happy
save
when
we
thought
of
those
we
had
left
at
home
there
is
no
space
here
to
tell
of
many
incidents
great
chiefs
who
had
not
been
to
the
council
came
hundreds
of
leagues
across
wide
rivers
that
they
might
see
with
their
own
eyes
this
man
who
had
made
peace
without
gold
and
these
had
to
be
amused
and
entertained
the
apples
ripened
and
were
shaken
to
the
ground
by
the
winds
the
good
father
gibault
true
to
his
promise
strove
to
teach
me
french
indeed
i
picked
up
much
of
that
language
in
my
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
kaskaskia
how
well
i
recall
that
simple
life
its
dances
its
songs
and
the
games
with
the
laughing
boys
and
girls
on
the
common
and
the
good
people
were
very
kind
to
the
orphan
that
dwelt
with
colonel
clark
the
drummer
boy
of
his
regiment
but
winter
brought
forebodings
when
the
garden
patches
grew
bare
and
brown
and
the
bleak
winds
from
across
the
mississippi
swept
over
the
common
untoward
tidings
came
like
water
dripping
from
a
roof
bit
by
bit
and
day
by
day
colonel
clark
looked
graver
the
messengers
he
had
sent
to
vincennes
came
not
back
and
the
coureurs
and
traders
from
time
to
time
brought
rumors
of
a
british
force
gathering
like
a
thundercloud
in
the
northeast
monsieur
vigo
himself
who
had
gone
to
vincennes
on
his
own
business
did
not
return
as
for
the
inhabitants
some
of
them
who
had
once
bowed
to
us
with
a
smile
now
passed
with
faces
averted
the
cold
set
the
miry
roads
like
cement
in
ruts
and
ridges
a
flurry
of
snow
came
and
powdered
the
roofs
even
as
the
french
loaves
are
powdered
it
was
january
there
was
colonel
clark
on
a
runt
of
an
indian
pony
tom
mcchesney
on
another
riding
ahead
several
french
gentlemen
seated
on
stools
in
a
cart
and
myself
we
were
going
to
cahokia
and
it
was
very
cold
and
when
the
tireless
wheels
bumped
from
ridge
to
gully
the
gentlemen
grabbed
each
other
as
they
slid
about
and
laughed
all
at
once
the
merriment
ceased
and
looking
forward
we
saw
that
tom
had
leaped
from
his
saddle
and
was
bending
over
something
in
the
snow
these
chanced
to
be
the
footprints
of
some
twenty
men
the
immediate
result
of
this
alarming
discovery
was
that
tom
went
on
express
to
warn
captain
bowman
and
the
rest
of
us
returned
to
a
painful
scene
at
kaskaskia
we
reached
the
village
the
french
gentlemen
leaped
down
from
their
stools
in
the
cart
and
in
ten
minutes
the
streets
were
filled
with
frenzied
hooded
figures
hamilton
called
the
hair
buyer
was
upon
them
with
no
less
than
six
hundred
and
he
would
hang
them
to
their
own
gateposts
for
listening
to
the
long
knives
these
were
but
a
handful
after
all
was
said
there
was
father
gibault
for
example
father
gibault
would
doubtless
be
exposed
to
the
crows
in
the
belfry
of
his
own
church
because
he
had
busied
himself
at
vincennes
and
with
other
matters
father
gibault
was
human
and
therefore
lovable
he
bade
his
parishioners
a
hasty
and
tearful
farewell
and
he
made
a
cold
and
painful
journey
to
the
territories
of
his
spanish
majesty
across
the
mississippi
father
gibault
looked
back
and
against
the
gray
of
the
winter
s
twilight
there
were
flames
like
red
maple
leaves
in
the
fort
the
men
stood
to
their
guns
their
faces
flushed
with
staring
at
the
burning
houses
only
a
few
were
burned
enough
to
give
no
cover
for
hamilton
and
his
six
hundred
if
they
came
but
they
did
not
come
the
faithful
bowman
and
his
men
arrived
instead
with
the
news
that
there
had
been
only
a
roving
party
of
forty
and
these
were
now
in
full
retreat
father
gibault
came
back
but
where
was
hamilton
this
was
the
disquieting
thing
one
bitter
day
when
the
sun
smiled
mockingly
on
the
powdered
common
a
horseman
was
perceived
on
the
fort
chartres
road
it
was
monsieur
vigo
returning
from
vincennes
but
he
had
been
first
to
louis
by
reason
of
the
value
he
set
upon
his
head
yes
monsieur
vigo
had
been
to
vincennes
remaining
a
little
longer
than
he
expected
the
guest
of
governor
hamilton
so
governor
hamilton
had
recaptured
that
place
monsieur
vigo
was
no
spy
hence
he
had
gone
first
to
louis
governor
hamilton
was
at
vincennes
with
much
of
king
george
s
gold
and
many
supplies
and
certain
indians
who
had
not
been
at
the
council
eight
hundred
in
all
said
monsieur
vigo
using
his
fingers
and
it
was
governor
hamilton
s
design
to
march
upon
kaskaskia
and
cahokia
and
sweep
over
kentucky
nay
he
had
already
sent
certain
emissaries
to
mcgillivray
and
his
creeks
and
the
southern
indians
with
presents
and
these
were
to
press
forward
on
their
side
the
governor
could
do
nothing
now
but
would
move
as
soon
as
the
rigors
of
winter
had
somewhat
relented
monsieur
vigo
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
loved
les
américains
what
would
monsieur
le
colonel
do
now
monsieur
le
colonel
was
grave
but
this
was
his
usual
manner
he
did
not
tear
his
hair
but
the
ways
of
the
long
knives
were
past
understanding
he
asked
many
questions
how
was
it
with
the
garrison
at
vincennes
monsieur
vigo
was
exact
as
a
business
man
should
be
they
were
now
reduced
to
eighty
men
and
five
hundred
savages
had
gone
out
to
ravage
there
was
no
chance
then
of
hamilton
moving
at
present
monsieur
vigo
threw
up
his
hands
never
had
he
made
such
a
trip
and
he
had
been
forced
to
come
back
by
a
northern
route
the
wabash
was
as
the
great
lakes
and
the
forests
grew
out
of
the
water
a
fox
could
not
go
to
vincennes
in
this
weather
a
fish
monsieur
vigo
laughed
heartily
yes
a
fish
might
then
said
colonel
clark
we
will
be
monsieur
vigo
stared
and
passed
his
hand
from
his
forehead
backwards
over
his
long
hair
i
leaned
forward
in
my
corner
by
the
hickory
fire
then
we
will
be
fish
said
colonel
clark
better
that
than
food
for
the
crows
for
if
we
stay
here
we
shall
be
caught
like
bears
in
a
trap
and
kentucky
will
be
at
hamilton
s
sacré
exclaimed
monsieur
vigo
you
are
mad
mon
ami
i
know
what
this
country
is
and
you
can
not
get
to
i
will
get
to
vincennes
said
colonel
clark
so
gently
that
monsieur
vigo
knew
he
meant
it
i
will
swim
to
monsieur
vigo
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
the
three
of
us
went
out
of
the
door
and
walked
there
was
a
snowy
place
in
front
of
the
church
all
like
a
clown
s
coat
scarlet
capotes
yellow
capotes
and
blue
capotes
and
bright
silk
handkerchiefs
they
surrounded
the
colonel
pardieu
what
was
he
to
do
now
for
the
british
governor
and
his
savages
were
coming
to
take
revenge
on
them
because
in
their
necessity
they
had
declared
for
congress
colonel
clark
went
silently
on
his
way
to
the
gate
but
monsieur
vigo
stopped
and
kaskaskia
heard
with
a
shock
that
this
man
of
iron
was
to
march
against
vincennes
the
gates
of
the
fort
were
shut
and
the
captains
summoned
undaunted
woodsmen
as
they
were
they
were
lukewarm
at
first
at
the
idea
of
this
march
through
the
floods
who
can
blame
them
they
had
indeed
sacrificed
much
but
in
ten
minutes
they
had
caught
his
enthusiasm
which
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
genius
and
the
men
paraded
in
the
snow
likewise
caught
it
and
swung
their
hats
at
the
notion
of
taking
the
hair
buyer
tis
no
news
to
me
said
terence
stamping
his
feet
on
the
flinty
ground
wasn
t
it
davy
that
pointed
him
out
to
us
and
the
hair
liftin
from
his
head
six
months
since
und
you
like
schwimmin
yes
said
swein
poulsson
his
face
like
the
rising
sun
with
the
cold
swimmin
is
it
said
terence
sure
the
divil
made
worse
things
than
wather
and
hamilton
s
i
reckon
that
ll
fetch
us
through
bill
cowan
put
in
grimly
it
was
a
blessed
thing
that
none
of
us
had
a
bird
view
of
that
same
water
no
man
of
force
will
listen
when
his
mind
is
made
up
and
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
for
in
that
way
things
are
accomplished
clark
would
not
listen
to
monsieur
vigo
and
hence
the
financier
had
perforce
to
listen
to
clark
there
were
several
miracles
before
we
left
monsieur
vigo
for
instance
agreed
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
expedition
though
in
his
heart
he
thought
we
should
never
get
to
vincennes
incidentally
he
was
never
repaid
then
there
were
the
french
yesterday
running
hither
and
thither
in
paroxysms
of
fear
enlisting
in
whole
companies
though
it
were
easier
to
get
to
the
wild
geese
of
the
swamps
than
to
hamilton
their
ladies
stitched
colors
day
and
night
and
presented
them
with
simple
confidence
to
the
colonel
in
the
church
twenty
stands
of
colors
for
men
counting
those
who
had
come
from
cahokia
think
of
the
industry
of
it
of
the
enthusiasm
behind
it
twenty
stands
of
colors
clark
took
them
all
and
in
due
time
it
will
be
told
how
the
colors
took
vincennes
this
was
because
colonel
clark
was
a
man
of
destiny
furthermore
colonel
clark
was
off
the
next
morning
at
dawn
to
buy
a
mississippi
he
had
her
rigged
up
with
two
and
four
swivels
filled
her
with
provisions
and
called
her
the
willing
she
was
the
first
gunboat
on
the
western
waters
a
great
fear
came
into
my
heart
and
at
dusk
i
stole
back
to
the
colonel
s
house
alone
the
snow
had
turned
to
rain
and
terence
stood
guard
within
the
doorway
arrah
he
said
what
ails
ye
darlin
i
gulped
and
the
tears
sprang
into
my
eyes
whereupon
terence
in
defiance
of
all
military
laws
laid
his
gun
against
the
doorpost
and
put
his
arms
around
me
and
i
confided
my
fears
it
was
at
this
critical
juncture
that
the
door
opened
and
colonel
clark
came
out
what
s
to
do
here
he
demanded
gazing
at
us
sternly
savin
your
honor
s
prisence
said
terence
he
s
afeard
your
honor
will
be
sending
him
on
the
boat
sure
he
wants
to
go
swimmin
with
the
rest
of
colonel
clark
frowned
bit
his
lip
and
terence
seized
his
gun
and
stood
to
attention
it
were
right
to
leave
you
in
kaskaskia
said
the
colonel
the
water
will
be
over
your
the
king
s
drum
would
be
floatin
the
likes
of
him
said
the
irrepressible
terence
and
the
b
ys
would
be
that
the
colonel
walked
away
without
a
word
in
an
hour
s
time
he
came
back
to
find
me
cleaning
his
accoutrements
by
the
fire
for
a
while
he
did
not
speak
but
busied
himself
with
his
papers
i
having
lighted
the
candles
for
him
presently
he
spoke
my
name
and
i
stood
before
him
i
will
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
davy
said
he
if
you
want
a
thing
go
straight
to
the
man
that
has
it
mcchesney
has
spoken
to
me
about
this
wild
notion
of
yours
of
going
to
vincennes
and
cowan
and
mccann
and
ray
and
a
dozen
others
have
dogged
my
i
only
spoke
to
terence
because
he
asked
me
sir
i
answered
i
said
nothing
to
any
one
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
at
me
with
an
odd
expression
what
a
weird
little
piece
you
are
he
exclaimed
you
seem
to
have
wormed
your
way
into
the
hearts
of
these
men
do
you
know
that
you
will
probably
never
get
to
vincennes
alive
i
don
t
care
sir
i
said
a
happy
thought
struck
me
if
they
see
a
boy
going
through
the
water
sir
i
hesitated
abashed
what
then
said
clark
shortly
it
may
keep
some
from
going
back
i
finished
at
that
he
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
and
stared
at
me
the
more
egad
he
said
i
believe
the
good
lord
launched
you
wrong
end
to
perchance
you
will
be
a
child
when
you
are
he
was
silent
a
long
time
and
fell
to
musing
and
i
thought
he
had
forgotten
may
i
go
sir
i
asked
at
length
he
started
come
here
said
he
but
when
i
was
close
to
him
he
merely
laid
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
yes
you
may
go
he
sighed
and
presently
turned
to
his
writing
again
and
i
went
back
joyfully
to
my
cleaning
on
a
certain
dark
of
february
picture
the
village
of
kaskaskia
assembled
on
the
in
capote
and
hood
ropes
are
cast
off
the
pushes
her
blunt
nose
through
the
cold
muddy
water
the
oars
churn
up
dirty
yellow
foam
and
cheers
shake
the
sodden
air
so
the
willing
left
on
her
long
journey
down
the
kaskaskia
into
the
flood
of
the
mississippi
against
many
weary
leagues
of
the
ohio
s
current
and
up
the
swollen
wabash
until
they
were
to
come
to
the
mouth
of
the
white
river
near
vincennes
there
they
were
to
await
us
should
we
ever
see
them
again
i
think
that
this
was
the
unspoken
question
in
the
hearts
of
the
many
who
were
to
go
by
land
the
was
a
mild
gray
day
with
the
melting
snow
lying
in
patches
on
the
brown
bluff
and
the
sun
making
shift
to
pierce
here
and
there
we
formed
the
regiment
in
the
fort
backwoodsman
and
creole
now
to
fight
for
their
common
country
jacques
and
pierre
and
alphonse
and
mother
and
father
sweetheart
and
wife
waiting
to
wave
a
last
bravely
we
marched
out
of
the
gate
and
into
the
church
for
father
gibault
s
blessing
and
then
forming
once
more
we
filed
away
on
the
road
leading
northward
to
the
ferry
our
colors
flying
leaving
the
weeping
cheering
crowd
behind
in
front
of
the
tall
men
of
the
column
was
a
wizened
figure
beating
madly
on
a
drum
stepping
proudly
with
head
thrown
back
it
was
cowan
s
voice
that
snapped
the
strain
go
it
davy
my
little
gamecock
he
cried
and
the
men
laughed
and
cheered
and
so
we
came
to
the
bleak
ferry
landing
where
we
had
crossed
on
that
hot
july
night
six
months
before
we
were
soon
on
the
prairies
and
in
the
misty
rain
that
fell
and
fell
they
seemed
to
melt
afar
into
a
gray
and
cheerless
ocean
the
sodden
grass
was
matted
now
and
unkempt
lifeless
lakes
filled
the
depressions
and
through
them
we
waded
mile
after
mile
there
was
a
little
cavalcade
mounted
on
the
tiny
french
ponies
and
sometimes
i
rode
with
these
but
oftenest
cowan
or
tom
would
fling
me
drum
and
all
on
his
shoulder
for
we
had
reached
the
forest
swamps
where
the
water
is
the
color
of
the
creole
coffee
and
day
after
day
as
we
marched
the
soft
rain
came
out
of
the
east
and
wet
us
to
the
skin
it
was
a
journey
of
torments
and
even
that
first
part
of
it
was
enough
to
discourage
the
most
resolute
spirit
men
might
be
led
through
it
but
never
driven
it
is
ever
the
mind
which
suffers
through
the
monotonies
of
bodily
discomfort
and
none
knew
this
better
than
clark
himself
every
morning
as
we
set
out
with
the
wet
hide
chafing
our
skin
the
colonel
would
run
the
length
of
the
regiment
crying
who
gives
the
feast
boys
now
it
was
bowman
s
company
now
mccarty
s
now
bayley
s
how
the
hunters
vied
with
each
other
to
supply
the
best
and
spent
the
days
stalking
the
deer
cowering
in
the
wet
thickets
we
crossed
the
saline
and
on
the
plains
beyond
was
a
great
black
patch
a
herd
of
buffalo
a
party
of
chosen
men
headed
by
tom
mcchesney
was
sent
after
them
and
never
shall
i
forget
the
sight
of
the
mad
beasts
charging
through
the
water
that
night
when
our
chilled
feet
could
bear
no
more
we
sought
out
a
patch
of
raised
ground
a
little
firmer
than
a
quagmire
and
heaped
up
the
beginnings
of
a
fire
with
such
brush
as
could
be
made
to
burn
robbing
the
naked
thickets
saddle
and
steak
sizzled
leather
steamed
and
stiffened
hearts
and
bodies
thawed
grievances
that
men
had
nursed
over
miles
of
water
melted
courage
sits
best
on
a
full
stomach
and
as
they
ate
they
cared
not
whether
the
atlantic
had
opened
between
them
and
vincennes
an
hour
agone
and
there
were
twenty
cursing
laggards
counting
the
leagues
back
to
kaskaskia
now

so
sang
antoine
dit
le

in
the
pulsing
red
light
and
when
between
the
verses
he
went
through
the
agonies
of
a
huron
the
assembled
regiment
howled
with
delight
some
men
know
cities
and
those
who
dwell
in
the
quarters
of
cities
but
grizzled
antoine
knew
the
half
of
a
continent
and
the
manners
of
trading
and
killing
of
the
tribes
thereof
and
after
antoine
came
gabriel
a
marked
contrast
gabriel
five
feet
six
and
the
glare
showing
but
a
faint
dark
line
on
his
quivering
lip
gabriel
was
a
patriot
a
tribute
we
must
pay
to
all
of
those
brave
frenchmen
who
went
with
us
nay
gabriel
had
left
at
home
on
his
little
farm
near
the
village
a
young
wife
of
a
fortnight
and
so
his
lip
quivered
as
he

we
had
need
of
gayety
after
that
and
so
bill
cowan
sang
billy
of
the
wild
wood
and
terence
mccann
wailed
an
irish
jig
stamping
the
water
out
of
the
spongy
ground
amidst
storms
of
mirth
as
he
desisted
breathless
and
panting
he
flung
me
up
in
the
firelight
before
the
eyes
of
them
all
crying
it
s
davy
can
bate
me
ay
davy
davy
they
shouted
for
they
were
in
the
mood
for
anything
there
stood
colonel
clark
in
the
dimmer
light
of
the
background
we
must
keep
em
screwed
up
davy
he
had
said
that
very
day
there
came
to
me
on
the
instant
a
wild
song
that
my
father
had
taught
me
when
the
liquor
held
him
in
dominance
exhilarated
i
sprang
from
terence
s
arms
to
the
sodden
bared
space
and
methinks
i
yet
hear
my
shrill
piping
note
and
see
my
legs
kicking
in
the
fling
of
it
there
was
an
uproar
a
deeper
voice
chimed
in
and
here
was
mcandrew
flinging
his
legs
with
mine
i
ve
faught

ye

seen
on

in
the
morning
clark
himself
would
be
the
first
off
through
the
gray
rain
laughing
and
shouting
and
waving
his
sword
in
the
air
and
i
after
him
as
hard
as
i
could
pelt
through
the
mud
beating
the
charge
on
my
drum
until
the
of
the
regiment
drowned
the
sound
of
it
for
we
were
upon
a
pleasure
trip
lest
any
man
forget
a
pleasure
trip
amidst
stark
woods
and
brown
plains
flecked
with
ponds
so
we
followed
him
until
we
came
to
a
place
where
in
summer
two
quiet
rivers
flowed
through
green
forests
the
little
wabashes
and
now
now
hickory
and
maple
oak
and
cottonwood
stood
shivering
in
three
feet
of
water
on
what
had
been
a
league
of
dry
land
we
stood
dismayed
at
the
crumbling
edge
of
the
hill
and
one
hundred
and
seventy
pairs
of
eyes
were
turned
on
clark
with
a
mere
glance
at
the
running
stream
high
on
the
bank
and
the
drowned
forest
beyond
he
turned
and
faced
them
i
reckon
you
ve
earned
a
rest
boys
he
said
we
ll
have
games
there
were
some
dozen
of
the
unflinching
who
needed
not
to
be
amused
choosing
a
great
poplar
these
he
set
to
hollowing
out
a
pirogue
and
himself
came
among
the
others
and
played
and
the
indian
game
of
ball
until
night
fell
and
these
instead
of
moping
and
quarrelling
forgot
that
night
as
i
cooked
him
a
buffalo
steak
he
drew
near
the
fire
with
bowman
for
the
love
of
god
keep
up
their
spirits
bowman
said
the
colonel
keep
up
their
spirits
until
we
get
them
across
once
on
the
farther
hills
they
can
not
go
here
was
a
different
being
from
the
shouting
boy
who
had
led
the
games
and
the
that
night
in
the
circle
of
the
blaze
tired
out
we
went
to
sleep
with
the
ring
of
the
axes
in
our
ears
and
in
the
morning
there
were
more
games
while
the
squad
crossed
the
river
to
the
drowned
neck
built
a
rough
scaffold
there
and
notched
a
trail
across
it
to
the
scaffold
the
baggage
was
ferried
and
the
next
morning
bit
by
bit
the
regiment
even
now
the
pains
shoot
through
my
body
when
i
think
of
how
man
after
man
plunged
into
the
icy
water
toward
the
farther
branch
the
pirogue
was
filled
with
the
weak
and
in
the
end
of
it
i
was
curled
up
with
my
drum
heroism
is
a
thing
it
is
one
matter
to
fight
and
finish
another
to
endure
hell
s
tortures
hour
after
hour
all
day
they
waded
with
numbed
feet
vainly
searching
for
a
footing
in
the
slime
truly
the
agony
of
a
brave
man
is
among
the
greatest
of
the
world
s
tragedies
to
see
as
they
splashed
onward
through
the
many
a
joke
went
forth
though
lips
were
drawn
and
teeth
pounded
together
i
have
not
the
heart
to
recall
these
jokes
it
would
seem
a
sacrilege
there
were
quarrels
too
the
men
striving
to
push
one
another
from
the
easier
paths
and
deeds
sublime
when
some
straggler
clutched
at
the
bole
of
a
tree
for
support
and
was
helped
onward
through
excruciating
ways
a
dozen
held
tremblingly
to
the
pirogue
s
gunwale
lest
they
fall
and
drown
one
walked
ahead
with
a
smile
or
else
fell
back
to
lend
a
helping
shoulder
to
a
fainting
man
and
there
was
tom
mcchesney
all
day
long
i
watched
him
and
thanked
god
that
polly
ann
could
not
see
him
thus
and
yet
how
the
pride
would
have
leaped
within
her
humor
came
not
easily
to
him
but
charity
and
courage
and
unselfishness
he
had
in
abundance
what
he
suffered
none
knew
but
through
those
awful
hours
he
was
always
among
the
stragglers
helping
the
weak
and
despairing
when
his
strength
might
have
taken
him
far
ahead
toward
comfort
and
safety
i
m
all
right
davy
he
would
say
in
answer
to
my
look
as
he
passed
me
but
on
his
face
was
written
something
that
i
did
not
understand
how
the
creole
farmers
and
traders
unused
even
to
the
common
ways
of
woodcraft
endured
that
fearful
day
and
others
that
followed
i
know
not
and
when
a
tardy
justice
shall
arise
and
compel
the
people
of
this
land
to
raise
a
shaft
in
memory
of
clark
and
those
who
followed
him
let
not
the
loyalty
of
the
french
be
forgotten
though
it
be
not
understood
at
eventide
came
to
lurid
and
disordered
brains
the
knowledge
that
the
other
branch
was
here
and
mercifully
it
was
shallower
than
the
first
holding
his
rifle
high
with
a
bill
cowan
plunged
into
the
stream
unable
to
contain
myself
more
i
flung
my
drum
overboard
and
went
after
it
and
amid
shouts
and
laughter
i
was
towed
across
by
james
ray
colonel
clark
stood
watching
from
the
bank
above
and
it
was
he
who
pulled
me
bedraggled
to
dry
land
i
ran
away
to
help
gather
brush
for
a
fire
as
i
was
heaping
this
in
a
pile
i
heard
something
that
i
should
not
have
heard
nor
ought
i
to
repeat
it
now
though
i
did
not
need
the
flames
to
send
the
blood
tingling
through
my
body
mcchesney
said
the
colonel
we
must
thank
our
stars
that
we
brought
the
boy
along
he
has
grit
and
as
good
a
head
as
any
of
us
i
reckon
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
him
some
of
them
would
have
turned
back
long
i
saw
tom
grinning
at
the
colonel
as
gratefully
as
though
he
himself
had
been
praised
the
blaze
started
and
soon
we
had
a
bonfire
some
had
not
the
strength
to
hold
out
the
buffalo
meat
to
the
fire
even
the
grumblers
and
mutineers
were
silent
owing
to
the
ordeal
they
had
gone
through
but
presently
when
they
began
to
be
warmed
and
fed
they
talked
of
other
trials
to
be
borne
the
embarrass
and
the
big
wabash
for
example
these
must
be
like
the
sea
itself
take
the
back
trail
if
ye
like
said
bill
cowan
with
a
loud
laugh
i
reckon
the
rest
of
us
kin
float
to
vincennes
on
davy
s
but
there
was
no
taking
the
back
trail
now
and
well
they
knew
it
the
games
began
the
unwilling
being
forced
to
play
and
before
they
fell
asleep
that
night
they
had
taken
vincennes
scalped
the
hair
buyer
and
were
far
on
the
march
to
detroit
mercifully
now
that
their
stomachs
were
full
they
had
no
worries
few
knew
the
danger
we
were
in
of
being
cut
off
by
hamilton
s
roving
bands
of
indians
there
would
be
no
retreat
no
escape
but
a
fight
to
the
death
and
i
heard
this
and
much
more
that
was
spoken
of
in
low
tones
at
the
colonel
s
fire
far
into
the
night
of
which
i
never
told
the
rank
and
file
not
even
tom
mcchesney
on
and
on
through
rain
and
water
we
marched
until
we
drew
near
to
the
river
embarrass
drew
near
did
i
say
sure
darlin
said
terence
staring
comically
over
the
gray
waste
we
ve
been
in
it
since
choosd
there
was
small
exaggeration
in
it
in
vain
did
our
feet
seek
the
deeper
water
it
would
go
no
higher
than
our
knees
and
the
sound
which
the
regiment
made
in
marching
was
like
that
of
a
great
flatboat
going
against
the
current
it
had
been
a
sad
day
and
now
that
the
gloom
of
the
night
was
setting
in
and
not
so
much
as
a
hummock
showed
itself
above
the
surface
the
creoles
began
to
murmur
and
small
wonder
where
was
this
man
leading
them
this
clark
who
had
come
amongst
them
from
the
skies
as
it
were
did
he
know
himself
night
fell
as
though
a
blanket
had
been
spread
over
the
and
above
the
dreary
splashing
men
could
be
heard
calling
to
one
another
in
the
darkness
nor
was
there
any
supper
ahead
for
our
food
was
gone
and
no
game
was
to
be
shot
over
this
watery
waste
a
cold
like
that
of
eternal
space
settled
in
our
bones
even
terence
mccann
grumbled
begob
said
he
tis
fine
weather
for
fishes
and
the
birrds
are
that
comfortable
in
the
threes
tis
no
place
for
a
baste
at
all
at
sometime
in
the
night
there
was
a
cry
ray
had
found
the
water
falling
from
an
oozy
bank
and
there
we
dozed
fitfully
until
we
were
startled
by
a
distant
boom
it
was
governor
hamilton
s
morning
gun
at
fort
sackville
vincennes
there
was
no
breakfast
how
we
made
our
way
benumbed
with
hunger
and
cold
to
the
banks
of
the
wabash
i
know
not
captain
mccarty
s
company
was
set
to
making
canoes
and
the
rest
of
us
looked
on
apathetically
as
the
huge
trees
staggered
and
fell
amidst
a
fountain
of
spray
in
the
shallow
water
we
were
but
three
leagues
from
vincennes
a
raft
was
bound
together
and
tom
mcchesney
and
three
other
scouts
sent
on
a
desperate
journey
across
the
river
in
search
of
boats
and
provisions
lest
we
starve
and
fall
and
die
on
the
wet
flats
before
he
left
tom
came
to
me
and
the
remembrance
of
his
gaunt
face
haunted
me
for
many
years
after
he
drew
something
from
his
bosom
and
held
it
out
to
me
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
bit
of
buffalo
steak
which
he
had
saved
i
shook
my
head
and
the
tears
came
into
my
eyes
come
davy
he
said
ye
re
so
little
and
i
beant
again
i
shook
my
head
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
say
nothing
i
reckon
polly
ann
d
never
forgive
me
if
anything
was
to
happen
to
you
said
he
at
that
i
grew
strangely
angry
it
s
you
who
need
it
i
cried
it
s
you
that
has
to
do
the
work
and
she
told
me
to
take
care
of
the
big
fellow
grinned
sheepishly
as
was
his
wont
tis
only
a
bite
he
pleaded
twouldn
t
only
make
me
hungry
and
he
looked
hard
at
me
and
it
might
be
the
savin
of
you
ye
ll
not
eat
it
for
polly
ann
s
sake
he
asked
coaxingly
twould
not
be
serving
her
i
answered
indignantly
ye
re
an
obstinate
little
deevil
he
cried
and
dropping
the
morsel
on
the
freshly
cut
stump
he
stalked
away
i
ran
after
him
crying
out
but
he
leaped
on
the
raft
that
was
already
in
the
stream
and
began
to
pole
across
i
slipped
the
piece
into
my
own
hunting
shirt
all
day
the
men
who
were
too
weak
to
swing
axes
sat
listless
on
the
bank
watching
in
vain
for
some
sight
of
the
willing
they
saw
a
canoe
rounding
the
bend
instead
with
a
single
occupant
paddling
madly
and
who
should
this
be
but
captain
willing
s
own
brother
escaped
from
the
fort
where
he
had
been
a
prisoner
he
told
us
that
a
man
named
maisonville
with
a
party
of
indians
was
in
pursuit
of
him
and
the
next
piece
of
news
he
had
was
in
the
way
of
raising
our
despair
a
little
governor
hamilton
s
astonishment
at
seeing
this
force
here
and
now
would
be
as
great
as
his
own
governor
hamilton
had
said
indeed
that
only
a
navy
could
take
vincennes
this
year
unfortunately
mr
willing
brought
no
food
next
in
order
came
five
frenchmen
trapped
by
our
scouts
nor
had
they
any
provisions
but
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
how
tom
mcchesney
returned
at
nightfall
the
hero
of
the
hour
he
had
shot
a
deer
and
never
did
wolves
pick
an
animal
cleaner
they
pressed
on
me
a
choice
piece
of
it
these
men
who
were
willing
to
go
hungry
for
the
sake
of
a
child
and
when
i
refused
it
they
would
have
forced
it
down
my
throat
swein
poulsson
he
that
once
hid
under
the
bed
deserves
a
special
tablet
to
his
memory
he
was
for
giving
me
all
he
had
though
his
little
eyes
were
unnaturally
bright
and
the
red
had
left
his
cheeks
now
he
haf
no
belly
only
a
leedle
on
his
backbone
he
cried
begob
thin
he
has
the
backbone
said
terence
i
have
a
piece
said
i
and
drew
forth
that
which
tom
had
given
me
they
brought
a
quarter
of
a
saddle
to
colonel
clark
but
he
smiled
at
them
kindly
and
told
them
to
divide
it
amongst
the
weak
he
looked
at
me
as
i
sat
with
my
feet
crossed
on
the
stump
i
will
follow
davy
s
example
said
he
at
length
the
canoes
were
finished
and
we
crossed
the
river
swimming
over
the
few
miserable
skeletons
of
the
french
ponies
we
had
brought
along
we
came
to
a
sugar
camp
and
beyond
it
stretching
between
us
and
vincennes
was
a
sea
of
water
here
we
made
our
camp
if
camp
it
could
be
called
there
was
no
fire
no
food
and
the
water
seeped
out
of
the
ground
on
which
we
lay
some
of
those
even
who
had
not
yet
spoken
now
openly
said
that
we
could
go
no
farther
for
the
wind
had
shifted
into
the
northwest
and
for
the
first
time
since
we
had
left
kaskaskia
we
saw
the
stars
gleaming
like
scattered
diamonds
in
the
sky
bit
by
bit
the
ground
hardened
and
if
by
chance
we
dozed
we
stuck
to
it
morning
found
the
men
huddled
like
sheep
their
hunting
shirts
hard
as
boards
and
long
before
hamilton
s
gun
we
were
up
and
stamping
antoine
poked
the
butt
of
his
rifle
through
the
ice
of
the
lake
in
front
of
us
i
think
we
not
get
to
vincennes
this
day
he
said
colonel
clark
who
heard
him
turned
to
me
fetch
mcchesney
here
davy
he
said
tom
came
mcchesney
said
he
when
i
give
the
word
take
davy
and
his
drum
on
your
shoulders
and
follow
me
and
davy
do
you
think
you
can
sing
that
song
you
gave
us
the
other
night
oh
yes
sir
i
answered
without
more
ado
the
colonel
broke
the
skim
of
ice
and
taking
some
of
the
water
in
his
hand
poured
powder
from
his
flask
into
it
and
rubbed
it
on
his
face
until
he
was
the
color
of
an
indian
stepping
back
he
raised
his
sword
high
in
the
air
and
shouting
the
shawanee
took
a
flying
leap
up
to
his
thighs
in
the
water
tom
swung
me
instantly
to
his
shoulder
and
followed
i
beating
the
charge
with
all
my
might
though
my
hands
were
so
numb
that
i
could
scarce
hold
the
sticks
strangest
of
all
to
a
man
they
came
shouting
after
us
now
davy
said
the
colonel
i
ve
faught
on
land
i
ve
faught
at
sea
at
hame
i
faught
my
aunty
o
but
i
met
the
deevil
and
dundee
on
the
braes
o
killiecrankie
i
piped
it
at
the
top
of
my
voice
and
sure
enough
the
regiment
took
up
the
chorus
for
it
had
a
famous
swing
an
ye
had
been
where
i
had
been
ye
wad
na
be
sae
cantie
o
an
ye
had
seen
what
i
ha
e
seen
on
the
braes
o
killiecrankie
when
their
breath
was
gone
we
heard
cowan
shout
that
he
had
found
a
path
under
his
feet
a
path
that
was
on
dry
land
in
the
we
followed
it
feeling
carefully
and
at
length
when
we
had
suffered
all
that
we
could
bear
we
stumbled
on
to
a
dry
ridge
here
we
spent
another
night
of
torture
with
a
second
backwater
facing
us
coated
with
a
full
inch
of
ice
and
still
there
was
nothing
to
eat
chapter
xix
the
hair
buyer
trapped
to
lie
the
night
on
adamant
pierced
by
the
needles
of
the
frost
to
awake
shivering
and
famished
until
the
meaning
of
an
inch
of
ice
on
the
backwater
comes
to
your
mind
these
are
not
calculated
to
put
a
man
into
an
equable
mood
to
listen
to
oratory
nevertheless
there
was
a
kind
of
oratory
to
fit
the
case
to
picture
the
misery
of
these
men
is
impossible
they
stood
sluggishly
in
groups
dazed
by
suffering
and
their
faces
were
drawn
and
their
eyes
ringed
their
beards
and
hair
matted
and
many
found
it
in
their
hearts
to
curse
clark
and
that
government
for
which
he
fought
when
the
red
fire
of
the
sun
glowed
through
the
bare
branches
that
morning
it
seemed
as
if
the
campaign
had
spent
itself
like
an
arrow
which
drops
at
the
foot
of
the
mark
could
life
and
interest
and
enthusiasm
be
infused
again
in
such
as
these
i
have
ceased
to
marvel
how
it
was
done
a
man
no
less
haggard
than
the
rest
but
with
a
compelling
force
in
his
eyes
pointed
with
a
blade
to
the
hills
across
the
river
they
must
get
to
them
he
said
and
their
troubles
would
be
ended
he
said
more
and
they
cheered
him
these
are
the
bare
facts
he
picked
a
man
here
and
another
there
and
these
went
silently
to
a
grim
duty
behind
the
regiment
if
any
try
to
go
back
shoot
them
down
he
cried
then
with
a
he
shattered
the
ice
and
was
the
first
to
leap
into
the
water
under
it
they
followed
some
with
a
cheer
that
was
most
pitiful
of
all
they
followed
him
blindly
as
men
go
to
torture
but
they
followed
him
and
the
splashing
and
crushing
of
the
ice
were
sounds
to
freeze
my
body
i
was
put
in
a
canoe
in
my
day
i
have
beheld
great
suffering
and
hardship
and
none
of
it
compared
to
this
torn
with
pity
i
saw
them
reeling
through
the
water
now
grasping
trees
and
bushes
to
try
to
keep
their
feet
the
strongest
breaking
the
way
ahead
and
supporting
the
weak
between
them
more
than
once
clark
himself
tottered
where
he
beat
the
ice
at
the
apex
of
the
line
some
swooned
and
would
have
drowned
had
they
not
been
dragged
across
the
canoe
and
chafed
back
to
consciousness
by
inches
the
water
shallowed
clark
reached
the
high
ground
and
then
bill
cowan
with
a
man
on
each
shoulder
then
others
endured
to
the
shallows
to
fall
heavily
in
the
crumbled
ice
and
be
dragged
out
before
they
died
but
at
length
by
god
s
grace
the
whole
regiment
was
on
the
land
fires
would
not
revive
some
but
clark
himself
seized
a
fainting
man
by
the
arms
and
walked
him
up
and
down
in
the
sunlight
until
his
blood
ran
again
it
was
a
glorious
day
a
day
when
the
sap
ran
in
the
maples
and
the
sun
soared
upwards
in
a
sky
of
the
palest
blue
all
this
we
saw
through
the
tracery
of
the
leafless
branches
a
mirthless
shivering
crowd
crept
through
a
hell
of
weather
into
the
hair
buyer
s
very
lair
had
he
neither
heard
nor
seen
down
the
lane
of
water
between
the
ice
came
a
canoe
our
stunted
senses
perceived
it
unresponsive
a
man
cried
out
it
was
tom
mcchesney
now
some
of
them
had
leaped
into
the
pirogue
now
they
were
returning
in
the
towed
canoe
two
fat
and
stolid
squaws
and
a
pappoose
were
huddled
and
beside
them
god
be
praised
food
a
piece
of
buffalo
on
its
way
to
town
and
in
the
end
compartment
of
the
boat
tallow
and
bear
s
grease
lay
revealed
by
two
blows
of
the
tomahawk
the
kettles
long
disused
were
fetched
and
broth
made
and
fed
in
sips
to
the
weakest
while
the
strongest
looked
on
and
smiled
in
an
agony
of
it
was
a
fearful
thing
to
see
men
whose
legs
had
refused
service
struggle
to
their
feet
when
they
had
drunk
the
steaming
greasy
mixture
and
the
colonel
standing
by
the
river
s
edge
turned
his
face
away
and
then
as
often
i
saw
the
other
side
of
the
man
suddenly
he
looked
at
me
standing
wistful
at
his
side
they
have
cursed
me
said
he
by
way
of
a
question
they
have
cursed
me
every
and
seeing
me
silent
he
insisted
tell
me
is
it
not
so
davy
it
is
so
i
said
wondering
that
he
should
pry
but
it
was
while
they
suffered
and
and
some
and
you
he
asked
queerly
i
i
could
not
sir
for
i
asked
leave
to
if
they
have
condemned
me
to
a
thousand
hells
said
he
dispassionately
i
should
not
blame
again
he
looked
at
me
do
you
understand
what
you
have
done
he
asked
no
sir
i
said
uneasily
and
yet
there
are
some
human
qualities
in
you
davy
you
have
been
worth
more
to
me
than
another
i
stared
when
you
grow
older
if
you
ever
do
tell
your
children
that
once
upon
a
time
you
put
a
hundred
men
to
shame
it
is
no
small
seeing
him
relapse
into
silence
i
did
not
speak
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
he
stared
down
the
river
and
i
knew
that
he
was
looking
vainly
for
the
willing
at
noon
we
crossed
piecemeal
a
deep
lake
in
the
canoes
and
marching
awhile
came
to
a
rise
which
our
french
prisoners
named
as
the
warriors
island
and
from
the
shelter
of
its
trees
we
saw
the
steely
lines
of
a
score
of
low
ponds
and
over
the
tops
of
as
many
ridges
a
huddle
of
brown
houses
on
the
higher
ground
and
this
was
the
place
we
had
all
but
sold
our
lives
to
behold
this
was
vincennes
at
last
we
were
on
the
heights
behind
the
town
we
were
at
the
back
door
as
it
were
at
the
far
side
on
the
wabash
river
was
the
front
door
or
fort
sackville
where
the
banner
of
england
snapped
in
the
february
breeze
we
stood
there
looking
as
the
afternoon
light
flooded
the
plain
suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
hooray
for
clark
cried
a
man
at
the
edge
of
the
copse
hooray
for
clark
it
was
the
whole
regiment
this
time
from
execration
to
exaltation
was
but
a
step
after
all
and
the
creoles
fell
to
scoffing
at
their
sufferings
and
even
forgot
their
hunger
in
staring
at
the
goal
the
backwoodsmen
took
matters
more
stolidly
having
acquired
long
since
the
art
of
waiting
they
lounged
about
cleaning
their
guns
watching
the
myriad
flocks
of
wild
ducks
and
geese
casting
shadows
on
the
ponds
arrah
mcchesney
said
terence
as
he
watched
the
circling
birds
clark
s
a
great
man
but
tis
more
riverince
i
d
have
for
him
if
wan
av
thim
was
sizzling
on
the
end
of
me
i
d
sooner
hev
the
ha
r
buyer
s
sculp
said
tom
presently
there
was
a
drama
performed
for
our
delectation
a
shot
came
down
the
wind
and
we
perceived
that
several
innocent
creole
gentlemen
unconscious
of
what
the
timber
held
were
shooting
the
ducks
and
geese
whereupon
clark
chose
antoine
and
three
of
our
own
creoles
to
sally
out
and
shoot
likewise
as
decoys
we
watched
them
working
their
way
over
the
ridges
and
finally
saw
them
coming
back
with
one
of
the
vincennes
sportsmen
i
can
not
begin
to
depict
the
astonishment
of
this
man
when
he
reached
the
copse
and
was
led
before
our
lean
commander
yes
monsieur
he
was
a
friend
of
les
américains
did
governor
hamilton
know
that
a
visit
was
imminent
pardieu
with
many
shrugs
and
outward
gestures
of
the
palms
governor
hamilton
had
said
if
the
long
knives
had
wings
or
fins
they
might
reach
him
now
he
was
all
unprepared
gentlemen
said
colonel
clark
to
captains
bowman
and
mccarty
and
williams
we
have
come
so
far
by
audacity
and
we
must
continue
by
audacity
it
is
of
no
use
to
wait
for
the
gunboat
and
every
moment
we
run
the
risk
of
discovery
i
shall
write
an
open
letter
to
the
inhabitants
of
vincennes
which
the
prisoner
shall
take
into
town
i
shall
tell
them
that
those
who
are
true
to
the
oath
they
swore
to
father
gibault
shall
not
be
molested
if
they
remain
quietly
in
their
houses
let
those
who
are
on
the
side
of
the
hair
buyer
general
and
his
king
go
to
the
fort
and
fight
he
bade
me
fetch
the
portfolio
he
carried
and
with
numbed
fingers
wrote
the
letter
while
his
captains
stared
in
admiration
and
amazement
what
a
stroke
was
this
there
were
six
hundred
men
in
the
town
and
fort
soldiers
inhabitants
and
indians
while
we
had
but
starved
and
weakened
by
their
incredible
march
but
clark
was
not
to
be
daunted
whipping
out
his
he
took
a
stand
on
a
little
mound
under
the
trees
and
followed
the
messenger
across
the
plain
saw
him
enter
the
town
saw
the
stir
in
the
streets
knots
of
men
riding
out
and
gazing
hands
on
foreheads
towards
the
place
where
we
were
but
as
the
minutes
rolled
into
hours
there
was
no
further
alarm
no
gun
no
beat
to
quarters
or
from
fort
sackville
what
could
it
mean
clark
s
next
move
was
an
enigma
for
he
set
the
men
to
cutting
and
trimming
tall
sapling
poles
to
these
were
tied
how
reverently
the
twenty
stands
of
colors
which
loving
creole
hands
had
stitched
the
boisterous
day
was
reddening
to
its
close
as
the
colonel
lined
his
little
army
in
front
of
the
wood
and
we
covered
the
space
of
four
thousand
for
the
men
were
twenty
feet
apart
and
every
tenth
carried
a
standard
suddenly
we
were
aghast
as
the
full
meaning
of
the
inspiration
dawned
upon
us
the
command
was
given
and
we
started
on
our
march
toward
vincennes
but
not
straight
zigzagging
always
keeping
the
ridges
between
us
and
the
town
and
to
the
watching
inhabitants
it
seemed
as
if
thousands
were
coming
to
crush
them
night
fell
the
colors
were
furled
and
the
saplings
dropped
and
we
pressed
into
serried
ranks
and
marched
straight
over
hill
and
dale
for
the
lights
that
were
beginning
to
twinkle
ahead
of
us
we
halted
once
more
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
clark
himself
had
picked
fourteen
men
to
go
under
lieutenant
bayley
through
the
town
and
take
the
fort
from
the
other
side
here
was
audacity
with
a
vengeance
you
may
be
sure
that
tom
and
cowan
and
ray
were
among
these
and
i
trotted
after
them
with
the
drum
banging
against
my
thighs
was
ever
stronghold
taken
thus
they
went
right
into
the
town
the
fourteen
of
them
into
the
main
street
that
led
directly
to
the
fort
the
simple
citizens
gave
back
stupefied
at
sight
of
the
tall
striding
forms
muffled
indians
stood
like
statues
as
we
passed
but
these
raised
not
a
hand
against
us
where
were
hamilton
hamilton
s
soldiers
and
savages
it
was
as
if
we
had
come
the
street
rose
and
fell
in
waves
like
the
prairie
over
which
it
ran
as
we
climbed
a
ridge
here
was
a
little
log
church
the
rude
cross
on
the
belfry
showing
dark
against
the
sky
and
there
in
front
of
us
flanked
by
blockhouses
with
conical
caps
was
the
frowning
mass
of
fort
sackville
take
cover
said
williams
hoarsely
it
seemed
incredible
the
men
spread
hither
and
thither
some
at
the
corners
of
the
church
some
behind
the
fences
of
the
little
gardens
tom
chose
a
great
forest
tree
that
had
been
left
standing
and
i
went
with
him
he
powdered
his
pan
and
i
laid
down
my
drum
beside
the
tree
and
then
with
an
impulse
that
was
rare
tom
seized
me
by
the
collar
and
drew
me
to
him
davy
he
whispered
and
i
pinched
him
davy
i
reckon
polly
ann
d
be
kinder
surprised
if
she
knew
where
we
was
eh
i
nodded
it
seemed
strange
indeed
to
be
talking
thus
at
such
a
place
life
has
taught
me
since
that
it
was
not
so
strange
for
however
a
man
may
strive
and
suffer
for
an
object
he
usually
sits
quiet
at
the
consummation
here
we
were
in
the
of
a
peaceful
cabin
the
ground
frozen
in
lumps
under
our
feet
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
wind
had
something
to
do
with
the
lightness
of
the
night
davy
whispered
tom
again
how
d
ye
like
to
see
the
little
feller
to
home
i
pinched
him
again
and
harder
this
time
for
i
was
at
a
loss
for
adequate
words
the
muscles
of
his
legs
were
as
hard
as
the
strands
of
a
rope
and
his
buckskin
breeches
frozen
so
that
they
cracked
under
my
fingers
suddenly
a
flickering
light
arose
ahead
of
us
and
another
and
we
saw
that
they
were
candles
beginning
to
twinkle
through
the
palings
of
the
fort
these
were
badly
set
the
width
of
a
man
s
hand
apart
presently
here
comes
a
soldier
with
a
torch
and
as
he
walked
we
could
see
from
crack
to
crack
his
bluff
face
all
reddened
by
the
light
and
so
near
were
we
that
we
heard
the
words
of
his
song
o
there
came
a
lass
to
sudbury
fair
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
and
she
had
a
rose
in
her
raven
hair
with
a
hey
and
a
ho
by
the
etarnal
said
tom
following
the
man
along
the
palings
with
the
muzzle
of
his
deckard
by
the
etarnal
tis
like
shootin
a
gust
of
laughter
came
from
somewhere
beyond
the
burly
soldier
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
blockhouse
hi
jem
have
ye
seen
the
general
s
man
his
honor
s
in
a
igh
temper
i
warrant
it
was
fortunate
for
jem
that
he
put
his
foot
inside
the
blockhouse
door
now
boys
it
was
williams
s
voice
and
fourteen
rifles
sputtered
out
a
ragged
volley
there
was
an
instant
s
silence
and
then
a
score
of
voices
raised
in
consternation
shouting
cursing
commanding
heavy
feet
pounded
on
the
platform
of
the
blockhouse
while
tom
was
savagely
jamming
in
powder
and
ball
the
wicket
gate
of
the
fort
opened
a
man
came
out
and
ran
to
a
house
a
biscuit
s
throw
away
and
ran
back
again
before
he
was
shot
at
slamming
the
gate
after
him
tom
swore
we
ve
got
but
the
ten
rounds
he
said
dropping
his
rifle
to
his
knee
i
reckon
tis
no
use
to
waste
the
willing
may
come
i
answered
there
was
a
bugle
winding
a
strange
call
and
the
roll
of
a
drum
and
the
running
continued
don
t
fire
till
you
re
sure
boys
said
captain
williams
our
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
form
in
the
blockhouse
port
there
was
an
instant
when
a
candle
flung
its
rays
upon
a
cannon
s
flank
and
tom
s
rifle
spat
a
rod
of
flame
a
red
blot
hid
the
cannon
s
mouth
and
behind
it
a
man
staggered
and
fell
on
the
candle
while
the
shot
crunched
its
way
through
the
logs
of
the
cottage
in
the
yard
where
we
stood
and
now
the
battle
was
on
in
earnest
fire
darting
here
and
there
from
the
black
wall
bullets
whistling
and
flying
wide
and
at
intervals
cannon
belching
their
shot
grinding
through
trees
and
houses
but
our
men
waited
until
the
gunners
lit
their
matches
in
the
it
was
no
trick
for
a
backwoodsman
at
length
there
came
a
popping
right
and
left
and
we
knew
that
bowman
and
mccarty
s
men
had
swung
into
position
there
an
hour
passed
and
a
shadow
came
along
our
line
darting
from
cover
to
cover
it
was
lieutenant
bayley
and
he
sent
me
back
to
find
the
colonel
and
to
tell
him
that
the
men
had
but
a
few
rounds
left
i
sped
through
the
streets
on
the
errand
spied
a
creole
company
waiting
in
reserve
and
near
them
behind
a
warehouse
a
knot
of
backwoodsmen
french
and
indians
lighted
up
by
a
smoking
torch
and
here
was
colonel
clark
talking
to
a
big
blanketed
chief
i
was
hovering
around
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
and
seeking
for
an
opening
when
a
hand
pulled
me
off
my
feet
what
ll
ye
be
afther
now
said
a
voice
which
was
terence
s
let
me
go
i
cried
i
have
a
message
from
lieutenant
sure
said
terence
a
man
d
think
ye
had
the
hair
buyer
s
sculp
in
yere
pocket
the
colonel
is
with
tobaccy
s
son
the
grreatest
injun
in
these
i
don
t
hist
said
terence
let
me
go
i
yelled
so
loudly
that
the
colonel
turned
and
terence
dropped
me
like
a
live
coal
i
wormed
my
way
to
where
clark
stood
tobacco
s
son
was
at
that
moment
protesting
that
the
big
knives
were
his
brothers
and
declaring
that
before
morning
broke
he
would
have
one
hundred
warriors
for
the
great
white
chief
had
he
not
made
a
treaty
of
peace
with
captain
helm
who
was
even
then
a
prisoner
of
the
british
general
in
the
fort
colonel
clark
replied
that
he
knew
well
of
the
fidelity
of
tobacco
s
son
to
the
big
knives
that
tobacco
s
son
had
remained
stanch
in
the
face
of
bribes
and
presents
this
was
true
now
all
that
colonel
clark
desired
of
tobacco
s
son
besides
his
friendship
was
that
he
would
keep
his
warriors
from
battle
the
big
knives
would
fight
their
own
fight
to
this
sentiment
tobacco
s
son
grunted
extreme
approval
colonel
clark
turned
to
me
what
is
it
davy
he
asked
i
told
him
tobacco
s
son
has
dug
up
for
us
king
george
s
ammunition
he
said
go
tell
lieutenant
bayley
that
i
will
send
him
enough
to
last
him
a
i
sped
away
with
the
message
presently
i
came
back
again
upon
another
message
and
they
were
eating
those
reserves
they
were
eating
as
i
had
never
seen
men
eat
but
once
at
kaskaskia
the
baker
stood
by
with
lifted
palms
imploring
the
saints
that
he
might
have
some
compensation
until
clark
sent
him
back
to
his
shop
to
knead
and
bake
again
the
good
creoles
approached
the
fires
with
the
contents
of
their
larders
in
their
hands
terence
tossed
me
a
loaf
the
size
of
a
cannon
ball
and
another
fetch
that
wan
to
wan
av
the
b
ys
said
he
i
seized
as
much
as
my
arms
could
hold
and
scurried
away
to
the
firing
line
once
more
and
heedless
of
whistling
bullets
darted
from
man
to
man
until
the
bread
was
exhausted
not
a
one
but
gave
me
a
god
bless
you
davy
ere
he
seized
it
with
a
great
hand
and
began
to
eat
in
wolfish
bites
his
deckard
always
on
the
watch
the
while
there
was
no
sleep
in
the
village
all
night
long
while
the
rifles
sputtered
the
villagers
in
their
capotes
men
women
and
children
huddled
around
the
fires
the
young
men
of
the
militia
begged
clark
to
allow
them
to
fight
and
to
keep
them
well
affected
he
sent
some
here
and
there
amongst
our
lines
for
our
colonel
s
strength
was
not
counted
by
rifles
or
men
alone
he
fought
with
his
brain
as
hamilton
the
hair
buyer
made
his
rounds
he
believed
the
town
to
be
in
possession
of
a
horde
of
kentuckians
shouts
and
bursts
of
laughter
went
up
from
behind
the
town
surely
a
great
force
was
there
a
small
part
of
which
had
been
sent
to
play
with
him
and
his
men
on
the
fighting
line
when
there
was
a
lull
our
backwoodsmen
stood
up
behind
their
trees
and
cursed
the
enemy
roundly
and
often
by
these
taunts
persuaded
the
furious
gunners
to
open
their
ports
and
fire
their
cannon
woe
be
to
him
that
showed
an
arm
or
a
shoulder
though
a
casement
be
lifted
ever
so
warily
a
dozen
balls
would
fly
into
it
and
at
length
when
some
of
the
besieged
had
died
in
their
anger
the
ports
were
opened
no
more
it
was
then
our
sharpshooters
crept
up
boldly
to
within
thirty
yards
of
them
nay
it
seemed
as
if
they
lay
under
the
very
walls
of
the
fort
and
through
the
night
the
figure
of
the
colonel
himself
was
often
seen
amongst
them
praising
their
markmanship
pleading
with
every
man
not
to
expose
himself
without
cause
he
spied
me
where
i
had
wormed
myself
behind
the
of
a
picket
fence
beneath
the
of
a
blockhouse
it
was
during
one
of
the
breathing
spaces
what
s
this
said
he
to
cowan
sharply
feeling
me
with
his
foot
i
reckon
it
s
davy
sir
said
my
friend
somewhat
sheepishly
we
can
t
do
nothin
with
him
he
s
been
up
and
down
the
line
twenty
times
this
what
doing
says
the
colonel
bread
and
powder
and
bullets
answered
bill
but
that
s
all
over
says
clark
he
s
the
very
devil
to
pry
answered
bill
the
first
we
know
he
ll
be
into
the
fort
under
the
or
between
them
says
clark
with
a
glance
at
the
open
palings
come
here
i
followed
him
dodging
between
the
houses
and
when
we
had
got
off
the
line
he
took
me
by
the
two
shoulders
from
behind
you
little
rascal
said
he
shaking
me
how
am
i
to
look
out
for
an
army
and
you
besides
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
yes
sir
i
answered
we
came
to
the
fires
and
captain
bowman
hurried
up
to
meet
him
we
re
piling
up
earthworks
and
barricades
said
the
captain
for
the
fight
my
god
if
the
willing
would
only
come
we
could
put
our
cannon
into
clark
laughed
bowman
said
he
kindly
has
davy
fed
you
yet
no
says
the
captain
surprised
i
ve
had
no
time
to
he
seems
to
have
fed
the
whole
army
said
the
colonel
he
paused
have
they
scented
lamothe
or
maisonville
devil
a
scent
cried
the
captain
and
we
ve
scoured
wood
and
quagmire
they
tell
me
that
lamothe
has
a
very
pretty
force
of
redskins
at
his
let
mcchesney
go
said
clark
sharply
mcchesney
and
ray
i
ll
warrant
they
can
find
now
i
knew
that
maisonville
had
gone
out
captain
willing
s
brother
he
who
had
run
into
our
arms
lamothe
was
a
noted
indian
partisan
and
a
dangerous
man
to
be
dogging
our
rear
that
night
suddenly
there
came
a
thought
that
took
my
breath
and
set
my
heart
when
the
colonel
s
back
was
turned
i
slipped
away
beyond
the
range
of
the
firelight
and
i
was
soon
on
the
prairie
stumbling
over
hummocks
and
floundering
into
ponds
yet
going
as
quietly
as
i
could
turning
now
and
again
to
look
back
at
the
distant
glow
or
to
listen
to
the
rifles
popping
around
the
fort
the
night
was
cloudy
and
pitchy
dark
twice
the
whirring
of
startled
waterfowl
frightened
me
out
of
my
senses
but
ambition
pricked
me
on
in
spite
of
fear
i
may
have
gone
a
mile
thus
perchance
two
or
three
straining
every
sense
when
a
sound
brought
me
to
a
stand
at
first
i
could
not
distinguish
it
because
of
my
heavy
breathing
but
presently
i
made
sure
that
it
was
the
low
drone
of
human
voices
getting
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
i
crept
forward
and
felt
the
ground
rising
the
voices
had
ceased
i
gained
the
crest
of
a
low
ridge
and
threw
myself
flat
a
rattle
of
musketry
set
me
shivering
and
in
an
agony
of
fright
i
looked
behind
me
to
discover
that
i
could
not
be
more
than
four
hundred
yards
from
the
fort
i
had
made
a
circle
i
lay
very
still
my
eyes
watered
with
staring
and
then
the
droning
began
again
i
went
forward
an
inch
then
another
and
another
down
the
slope
and
at
last
i
could
have
sworn
that
i
saw
dark
blurs
against
the
ground
i
put
out
my
hand
my
weight
went
after
and
i
had
crashed
through
a
coating
of
ice
up
to
my
elbow
in
a
pool
there
came
a
second
of
sheer
terror
a
hoarse
challenge
in
french
and
then
i
took
to
my
heels
and
flew
towards
the
fort
at
the
top
of
my
speed
i
heard
them
coming
after
me
leap
and
bound
and
crying
out
to
one
another
ahead
of
me
there
might
have
been
a
floor
or
a
precipice
as
the
ground
looks
level
at
night
i
hurt
my
foot
cruelly
on
a
frozen
clod
of
earth
slid
down
the
washed
bank
of
a
run
into
the
wabash
picked
myself
up
scrambled
to
the
top
of
the
far
side
and
had
gotten
away
again
when
my
pursuer
shattered
the
ice
behind
me
a
hundred
yards
more
two
figures
loomed
up
in
front
and
i
was
pulled
up
choking
hang
to
him
fletcher
said
a
voice
great
god
cried
fletcher
it
s
davy
what
are
ye
up
to
now
let
me
go
i
cried
as
soon
as
i
had
got
my
wind
as
luck
would
have
it
i
had
run
into
a
pair
of
daredevil
young
kentuckians
who
had
more
than
once
tasted
the
severity
of
clark
s
discipline
fletcher
blount
and
jim
willis
they
fairly
shook
out
of
me
what
had
happened
and
then
dropped
me
with
a
and
started
for
the
prairie
i
after
them
crying
out
to
them
to
beware
of
the
run
a
man
must
indeed
be
fleet
of
foot
to
have
escaped
these
young
ruffians
and
so
it
proved
when
i
reached
the
hollow
there
were
the
two
of
them
fighting
with
a
man
in
the
water
the
ice
jangling
as
they
shifted
their
feet
what
s
yere
name
said
fletcher
cuffing
and
kicking
his
prisoner
until
he
cried
out
for
mercy
maisonville
said
the
man
whereupon
fletcher
gave
a
and
kicked
him
again
that
s
no
way
to
use
a
prisoner
said
i
hotly
hold
your
mouth
davy
said
fletcher
you
didn
t
ketch
you
wouldn
t
have
had
him
but
for
me
i
retorted
fletcher
s
answer
was
an
oath
they
put
maisonville
between
them
ran
him
through
the
town
up
to
the
firing
line
and
there
to
my
horror
they
tied
him
to
a
post
and
used
him
for
a
shield
despite
his
yells
in
mortal
fear
that
the
poor
man
would
be
shot
down
i
was
running
away
to
find
some
one
who
might
have
influence
over
them
when
i
met
a
lieutenant
he
came
up
and
ordered
them
angrily
to
unbind
maisonville
and
bring
him
before
the
colonel
fletcher
laughed
whipped
out
his
hunting
knife
and
cut
the
thongs
but
he
and
willis
had
scarce
got
twenty
paces
from
the
officer
before
they
seized
poor
maisonville
by
the
hair
and
made
shift
to
scalp
him
this
was
merely
backwoods
play
had
maisonville
but
known
it
persuaded
however
that
his
last
hour
was
come
he
made
a
desperate
effort
to
clear
himself
whereupon
fletcher
cut
off
a
piece
of
his
skin
by
mistake
maisonville
making
sure
that
he
had
been
scalped
stood
groaning
and
clapping
his
hand
to
his
head
while
the
two
young
rascals
drew
back
and
stared
at
each
other
what
s
to
do
now
said
willis
take
our
medicine
i
reckon
answered
fletcher
grimly
and
they
seized
the
tottering
man
between
them
and
marched
him
straightway
to
the
fire
where
clark
stood
they
had
seen
the
colonel
angry
before
but
now
they
were
fairly
withered
under
his
wrath
and
he
could
have
given
them
no
greater
punishment
for
he
took
them
from
the
firing
line
and
sent
them
back
to
wait
among
the
reserves
until
the
morning
nom
de
dieu
said
maisonville
wrathfully
as
he
watched
them
go
they
should
the
stuff
that
brought
them
here
through
ice
and
flood
is
apt
to
boil
over
captain
remarked
the
colonel
dryly
if
you
please
sir
said
i
they
did
not
mean
to
cut
him
but
he
clark
turned
sharply
eh
said
he
did
you
have
a
hand
in
this
too
peste
cried
the
captain
the
little
ferret
you
call
him
he
find
me
on
the
prairie
i
run
to
catch
him
with
some
men
and
fall
into
the
crick
he
pointed
to
his
soaked
leggings
and
your
demons
they
fall
on
top
of
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
caught
lamothe
instead
davy
said
the
colonel
and
joined
despite
himself
in
the
laugh
that
went
up
falling
sober
again
he
began
to
question
the
prisoner
where
was
lamothe
pardieu
maisonville
could
not
say
how
many
men
did
he
have
the
circle
about
us
deepened
with
eager
listeners
who
uttered
exclamations
when
maisonville
between
his
answers
put
up
his
hand
to
his
bleeding
head
suddenly
the
circle
parted
and
captain
bowman
came
through
ray
has
discovered
lamothe
sir
said
he
what
shall
we
do
let
him
into
the
fort
said
clark
instantly
there
was
a
murmur
of
astonished
protest
let
him
into
the
fort
exclaimed
bowman
certainly
said
the
colonel
if
he
finds
he
can
not
get
in
he
will
be
off
before
the
dawn
to
assemble
the
but
the
fort
is
provisioned
for
a
month
bowman
expostulated
and
they
must
find
out
how
weak
we
will
be
too
late
said
clark
and
suppose
he
shouldn
t
go
in
he
will
go
in
said
the
colonel
quietly
withdraw
your
men
captain
from
the
north
captain
bowman
departed
whatever
he
may
have
thought
of
these
orders
he
was
too
faithful
a
friend
of
the
colonel
s
to
delay
their
execution
murmuring
swearing
oaths
of
astonishment
man
after
man
on
the
firing
line
dropped
his
rifle
at
the
word
and
sullenly
retreated
the
crack
crack
of
the
deckards
on
the
south
and
east
were
stilled
not
a
barrel
was
thrust
by
the
weary
garrison
through
the
logs
and
the
place
became
silent
as
the
wilderness
it
was
the
long
hour
before
the
dawn
and
as
we
lay
waiting
on
the
hard
ground
stiff
and
cold
and
hungry
talking
in
whispers
somewhere
near
six
of
the
clock
on
that
february
morning
the
great
square
of
fort
sackville
began
to
take
shape
there
was
the
long
line
of
the
stockade
the
projecting
blockhouses
at
each
corner
with
peaked
caps
and
a
higher
capped
square
tower
from
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
the
banner
of
england
drooping
there
and
clinging
forlorn
to
its
staff
as
though
with
a
presentiment
then
as
the
light
grew
the
casements
were
seen
scarred
with
our
bullets
the
little
log
houses
of
the
town
came
out
the
sapling
palings
and
the
bare
trees
all
grim
and
gaunt
at
that
cruel
season
cattle
lowed
here
and
there
and
horses
whinnied
to
be
fed
it
was
a
dirty
gray
dawn
and
we
waited
until
it
had
done
its
best
from
where
we
lay
hid
behind
log
house
and
palings
we
strained
our
eyes
towards
the
prairie
to
see
if
lamothe
would
take
the
bait
until
our
view
was
ended
at
the
fuzzy
top
of
a
hillock
bill
cowan
doubled
up
behind
a
woodpile
and
breathing
heavily
nudged
me
davy
davy
what
d
ye
see
was
it
a
head
that
broke
the
line
of
the
crest
even
as
i
stared
breathless
half
a
score
of
forms
shot
up
and
were
running
madly
for
the
stockade
twenty
more
broke
after
them
indians
and
frenchmen
dodging
swaying
crowding
looking
fearfully
to
right
and
left
and
from
within
the
fort
came
forth
a
hubbub
cries
and
scuffling
orders
oaths
and
shouts
in
plain
view
of
our
impatient
deckards
soldiers
manned
the
platform
and
we
saw
that
they
were
flinging
down
ladders
an
officer
in
a
faded
scarlet
coat
stood
out
among
the
rest
shouting
himself
hoarse
involuntarily
cowan
lined
his
sights
across
the
woodpile
on
this
mark
of
color
lamothe
s
men
a
seething
mass
were
fighting
like
wolves
for
the
ladders
fearful
yet
that
a
volley
might
kill
half
of
them
where
they
stood
and
so
fast
did
they
scramble
upwards
that
the
men
before
them
stepped
on
their
fingers
all
at
once
and
by
acclamation
the
fierce
of
our
men
rent
the
air
and
some
toppled
in
sheer
terror
and
fell
the
twelve
feet
of
the
stockade
at
the
sound
of
it
then
every
man
in
the
regiment
creole
and
backwoodsman
lay
back
to
laugh
the
answer
of
the
garrison
was
a
defiant
cheer
and
those
who
had
dropped
finding
they
were
not
shot
at
picked
themselves
up
again
and
gained
the
top
helping
to
pull
the
ladders
after
them
bowman
s
men
swung
back
into
place
the
rattle
and
drag
were
heard
in
the
blockhouse
as
the
cannon
were
run
out
through
the
ports
and
the
battle
which
had
held
through
the
night
watches
began
again
with
redoubled
vigor
but
there
was
more
caution
on
the
side
of
the
british
for
they
had
learned
dearly
how
the
kentuckians
could
measure
crack
and
crevice
there
followed
two
hours
and
a
futile
waste
of
ammunition
the
lead
from
the
garrison
flying
harmless
here
and
there
and
not
a
patch
of
skin
or

the

if
i
am
obliged
to
storm
you
may
depend
upon
such
treatment
as
is
justly
due

a

if

read
colonel
clark
as
he
stood
before
the
log
fire
in
monsieur
bouton
s
house
at
the
back
of
the
town
the
captains
grouped
in
front
of
him
is
that
strong
enough
gentlemen
he
asked
to
raise
his
hair
said
captain
charleville
captain
bowman
laughed
loudly
i
reckon
the
boys
will
see
to
that
said
he
colonel
clark
folded
the
letter
addressed
it
and
turned
gravely
to
monsieur
bouton
you
will
oblige
me
sir
said
he
by
taking
this
to
governor
hamilton
you
will
be
provided
with
a
flag
of
monsieur
bouton
was
a
round
little
man
as
his
name
suggested
and
the
men
cheered
him
as
he
strode
soberly
up
the
street
a
piece
of
sheeting
tied
to
a
sapling
and
flung
over
his
shoulder
through
such
humble
agencies
are
the
ends
of
providence
accomplished
monsieur
bouton
walked
up
to
the
gate
disappeared
sidewise
through
the
postern
and
we
sat
down
to
breakfast
in
a
very
short
time
monsieur
bouton
was
seen
coming
back
and
his
face
was
not
so
impassive
that
the
governor
s
message
could
not
be
read
thereon
tis
not
a
he
has
i
ll
warrant
said
terence
as
the
little
man
disappeared
into
the
house
so
accurately
had
monsieur
bouton
s
face
betrayed
the
news
that
the
men
went
back
to
their
posts
without
orders
some
with
half
a
breakfast
in
hand
and
soon
the
rank
and
file
had
the
message
hamilton
begs
leave
to
acquaint
colonel
clark
that
he
and
his
garrison
are
not
disposed
to
be
awed
into
any
action
unworthy
of
british
our
men
had
eaten
their
enemy
was
within
their
grasp
and
clark
and
all
his
officers
could
scarce
keep
them
from
storming
such
was
the
deadliness
of
their
aim
that
scarce
a
shot
came
back
and
time
and
again
i
saw
men
fling
themselves
in
front
of
the
breastworks
with
a
wave
their
rifles
in
the
air
and
cry
out
that
they
would
have
the
ha
r
buyer
s
sculp
before
night
should
fall
it
could
not
last
not
tuned
to
the
nicer
courtesies
of
warfare
the
memory
of
hamilton
s
war
parties
of
blackened
homes
of
families
dead
and
missing
raged
unappeased
these
were
not
content
to
leave
vengeance
in
the
lord
s
hands
and
when
a
white
flag
peeped
timorously
above
the
gate
a
great
yell
of
derision
went
up
from
to
out
of
the
postern
stepped
the
officer
with
the
faded
scarlet
coat
and
in
due
time
went
back
again
haughtily
his
head
high
casting
contempt
right
and
left
of
him
again
the
postern
opened
and
this
time
there
was
a
cheer
at
sight
of
a
man
in
hunting
shirt
and
leggings
and
coonskin
cap
after
him
came
a
certain
major
hay
of
detested
memory
the
lieutenant
of
him
who
followed
the
hair
buyer
himself
a
murmur
of
hatred
arose
from
the
men
stationed
there
and
many
would
have
shot
him
where
he
stood
but
for
clark
the
devil
has
the
grit
said
cowan
though
his
eyes
blazed
it
was
the
involuntary
tribute
hamilton
stared
indifferently
at
the
glowering
backwoodsmen
as
he
walked
the
few
steps
to
the
church
not
so
major
hay
his
eyes
fell
there
was
colonel
clark
waiting
at
the
door
through
which
the
good
creoles
had
been
wont
to
go
to
worship
bowing
somewhat
ironically
to
the
british
general
it
was
a
strange
meeting
they
had
in
xavier
s
by
the
light
of
the
candles
on
the
altar
hot
words
passed
in
that
house
of
peace
the
general
demanding
protection
for
all
his
men
and
our
colonel
replying
that
he
would
do
with
the
indian
partisans
as
he
chose
and
whom
mean
you
by
indian
partisans
the
undaunted
governor
had
demanded
i
take
major
hay
to
be
one
of
them
our
colonel
had
answered
it
was
soon
a
matter
of
common
report
how
clark
had
gazed
fixedly
at
the
major
when
he
said
this
and
how
the
major
turned
pale
and
trembled
with
our
own
eyes
we
saw
them
coming
out
major
hay
as
near
to
staggering
as
a
man
could
be
the
governor
blushing
red
for
shame
of
him
so
they
went
sorrowfully
back
to
the
gate
colonel
clark
stood
at
the
steps
of
the
church
looking
after
them
what
was
that
firing
he
demanded
sharply
i
gave
orders
for
a
we
who
stood
by
the
church
had
indeed
heard
firing
in
the
direction
of
the
hills
east
of
the
town
and
had
wondered
thereat
perceiving
a
crowd
gathered
at
the
far
end
of
the
street
we
all
ran
thither
save
the
colonel
who
directed
to
have
the
offenders
brought
to
him
at
monsieur
bouton
s
we
met
the
news
halfway
a
party
of
canadians
and
indians
had
just
returned
from
the
falls
of
the
ohio
with
scalps
they
had
taken
captain
williams
had
gone
out
with
his
company
to
meet
them
had
lured
them
on
and
finally
had
killed
a
number
and
was
returning
with
the
prisoners
yes
here
they
were
williams
himself
walked
ahead
with
two
dishevelled
and
frightened
coureurs
du
bois
twoscore
at
least
of
the
townspeople
of
vincennes
friends
and
relatives
of
the
prisoners
pressing
about
and
crying
out
to
williams
to
have
mercy
on
them
as
for
williams
he
took
them
in
to
the
colonel
the
townspeople
pressing
into
the
and
banking
in
front
of
it
on
the
street
behind
all
a
tragedy
impended
nor
can
i
think
of
it
now
without
sickening
the
frightened
creoles
in
the
street
gave
back
against
the
fence
and
from
behind
them
issuing
as
a
came
the
half
of
williams
company
yelling
like
madmen
pushed
and
jostled
ahead
of
them
were
four
indians
decked
and
feathered
the
scalps
dangling
from
their
belts
impassive
true
to
their
creed
despite
the
indignity
of
jolts
and
jars
and
blows
on
and
on
pressed
the
mob
gathering
recruits
at
every
corner
and
when
they
reached
xavier
s
before
the
fort
half
the
regiment
was
there
others
watched
too
from
the
stockade
and
what
they
saw
made
their
knees
smite
together
with
fear
here
were
four
bronzed
statues
in
a
row
across
the
street
the
space
in
front
of
them
clear
that
their
partisans
in
the
fort
might
look
and
consider
what
was
passing
in
the
savage
mind
no
man
might
know
not
a
lip
trembled
nor
an
eye
faltered
when
a
backwoodsman
his
memory
aflame
at
sight
of
the
pitiful
white
scalps
on
their
belts
thrust
through
the
crowd
to
curse
them
fletcher
blount
frenzied
snatched
his
tomahawk
from
his
side
sink
varmint
he
cried
with
a
great
oath
by
the
etarnal
we
ll
pay
the
h
ar
buyer
in
his
own
coin
sound
your
drums
he
shouted
at
the
fort
call
the
garrison
fer
the
he
had
raised
his
arm
and
turned
to
strike
when
the
savage
put
up
his
hand
not
in
entreaty
but
as
one
man
demanding
a
right
from
another
the
cries
the
curses
the
murmurs
even
were
hushed
throwing
back
his
head
arching
his
chest
the
notes
of
a
song
rose
in
the
heavy
air
wild
strange
notes
they
were
that
struck
vibrant
chords
in
my
own
quivering
being
and
the
song
was
the
ay
and
the
of
a
soul
which
had
come
into
the
world
even
as
mine
own
and
somewhere
there
lay
in
the
song
half
revealed
the
awful
mystery
of
that
creator
whom
the
soul
leaped
forth
to
meet
the
myriad
green
of
the
sun
playing
with
the
leaves
the
fish
swimming
lazily
in
the
brown
pool
the
doe
grazing
in
the
thicket
and
a
naked
boy
as
free
from
care
as
these
and
still
the
life
grows
brighter
as
strength
comes
and
stature
and
power
over
man
and
beast
and
then
god
knows
what
memories
of
fierce
love
and
fiercer
wars
and
triumphs
of
desires
gained
and
enemies
conquered
god
who
has
made
all
lives
akin
to
something
which
he
holds
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
then
the
rain
beating
on
the
forest
crown
beating
beating
beating
the
song
ceased
the
indian
knelt
in
the
black
mud
not
at
the
feet
of
fletcher
blount
but
on
the
threshold
of
the
great
spirit
who
ruleth
all
things
the
axe
fell
yet
he
uttered
no
cry
as
he
went
before
his
master
so
the
four
sang
each
in
turn
and
died
in
the
sight
of
some
who
pitied
and
some
who
feared
and
some
who
hated
for
the
sake
of
land
and
women
so
the
four
went
beyond
the
power
of
gold
and
gewgaw
and
were
dragged
in
the
mire
around
the
walls
and
flung
into
the
yellow
waters
of
the
river
through
the
dreary
afternoon
the
men
lounged
about
and
cursed
the
parley
and
hearkened
for
the
tattoo
the
signal
agreed
upon
by
the
leaders
to
begin
the
fighting
there
had
been
no
command
against
taunts
and
jeers
and
they
gathered
in
groups
under
the
walls
to
indulge
themselves
and
even
tried
to
bribe
me
as
i
sat
braced
against
a
house
with
my
drum
between
my
knees
and
the
sticks
clutched
tightly
in
my
hands
here
s
a
spanish
dollar
for
a
couple
o
taps
davy
shouted
jack
terrell
come
on
ye
pack
of
rebel
cutthroats
yelled
a
man
on
the
wall
he
was
answered
by
a
torrent
of
imprecations
and
so
they
flung
it
back
and
forth
until
nightfall
when
out
comes
the
same
officer
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
marches
down
the
street
to
monsieur
bouton
s
there
would
be
no
storming
now
nor
any
man
suffered
to
lay
fingers
on
the
hair
buyer
i
remember
in
particular
hamilton
the
hair
buyer
not
the
fiend
my
imagination
had
depicted
i
have
since
learned
that
most
villains
do
not
look
the
part
but
a
man
with
a
great
sorrow
stamped
upon
his
face
the
sun
rose
on
that
of
february
and
the
mud
melted
and
one
of
our
companies
drew
up
on
each
side
of
the
gate
downward
slid
the
lion
of
england
the
garrison
drums
beat
a
dirge
and
the
hair
buyer
marched
out
at
the
head
of
his
motley
troops
then
came
my
own
greatest
hour
all
morning
i
had
been
polishing
and
tightening
the
drum
and
my
pride
was
so
great
as
we
fell
into
line
that
so
much
as
a
smile
could
not
be
got
out
of
me
picture
it
all
vincennes
in
black
and
white
by
reason
of
the
bright
day
eaves
and
gables
stockade
line
and
capped
towers
sharply
drawn
and
straight
above
these
a
stark
flagstaff
waiting
for
our
colors
pigs
and
fowls
straying
hither
and
thither
unmindful
that
this
day
is
red
on
the
calendar
ah
here
is
a
bit
of
color
too
the
villagers
on
the
side
streets
to
see
the
spectacle
gay
wools
and
gayer
handkerchiefs
there
amid
the
joyous
cheering
crowd
of
nationality
vive
les
bostonnais
vive
les
américains
vive
monsieur
le
colonel
clark
vive
le
petit

vive
le
petit
tambour
that
was
the
drummer
boy
stepping
proudly
behind
the
colonel
himself
with
a
soul
lifted
high
above
mire
and
puddle
into
the
blue
above
there
was
laughter
amongst
the
giants
behind
me
and
cowan
saying
softly
as
when
we
left
kaskaskia
go
it
davy
my
little
gamecock
and
the
whisper
of
it
was
repeated
among
the
ranks
drawn
up
by
the
gate
yes
here
was
the
gate
and
now
we
were
in
the
fort
and
an
empire
was
gained
never
to
be
lost
again
the
stars
and
stripes
climbed
the
staff
and
the
folds
were
caught
by
an
eager
breeze
thirteen
cannon
thundered
from
the
blockhouses
one
for
each
colony
that
had
braved
a
king
there
in
the
miry
square
within
the
vincennes
fort
thin
and
bronzed
and
were
the
men
who
had
dared
the
wilderness
in
ugliest
mood
and
yet
none
by
himself
would
have
done
it
each
had
come
here
compelled
by
a
spirit
stronger
than
his
own
by
a
master
mind
that
laughed
at
the
body
and
its
ailments
colonel
george
rogers
clark
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
square
under
the
flag
to
whose
renown
he
had
added
three
stars
straight
he
was
and
square
and
no
weakening
tremor
of
exultation
softened
his
face
as
he
looked
upon
the
men
by
whose
endurance
he
had
been
able
to
do
this
thing
he
waited
until
the
white
smoke
of
the
last
gun
had
drifted
away
on
the
breeze
until
the
snapping
of
the
flag
and
the
distant
village
sounds
alone
broke
the
stillness
we
have
not
suffered
all
things
for
a
reward
he
said
but
because
a
righteous
cause
may
grow
and
though
our
names
may
be
forgotten
our
deeds
will
be
remembered
we
have
conquered
a
vast
land
that
our
children
and
our
children
s
children
may
be
freed
from
tyranny
and
we
have
brought
a
just
vengeance
upon
our
enemies
i
thank
you
one
and
all
in
the
name
of
the
continental
congress
and
of
that
commonwealth
of
virginia
for
which
you
have
fought
you
are
no
longer
virginians
kentuckians
kaskaskians
and
cahokians
you
are
he
paused
and
we
were
silent
though
his
words
moved
us
strongly
they
were
beyond
us
i
mention
no
deeds
of
heroism
of
unselfishness
of
lives
saved
at
the
peril
of
others
but
i
am
the
debtor
of
every
man
here
for
the
years
to
come
to
see
that
he
and
his
family
have
justice
from
the
commonwealth
and
the
again
he
stopped
and
it
seemed
to
us
watching
that
he
smiled
a
little
i
shall
name
one
he
said
one
who
never
lagged
who
never
complained
who
starved
that
the
weak
might
be
fed
and
walk
david
ritchie
come
i
trembled
my
teeth
chattered
as
the
water
had
never
made
them
chatter
i
believe
i
should
have
fallen
but
for
tom
who
reached
out
from
the
ranks
i
stumbled
forward
in
a
daze
to
where
the
colonel
stood
and
the
cheering
from
the
ranks
was
a
thing
beyond
me
the
colonel
s
hand
on
my
head
brought
me
to
my
senses
david
ritchie
he
said
i
give
you
publicly
the
thanks
of
the
regiment
the
parade
is
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
on
cowan
s
shoulders
and
he
was
tearing
round
and
round
the
fort
with
two
companies
at
his
heels
the
divil
said
terence
mccann
he
dhrummed
us
over
the
wather
an
through
the
wather
and
faix
he
would
have
dhrummed
the
sculp
from
hamilton
s
head
and
the
colonel
had
said
the
by
gar
cried
antoine
le
gris
now
he
drum
us
on
to
out
of
the
gate
rushed
cowan
the
frightened
villagers
scattering
right
and
left
antoine
had
a
friend
who
lived
in
this
street
and
in
ten
minutes
there
was
rum
in
the
and
the
toast
was
on
to
detroit
colonel
clark
was
sitting
alone
in
the
commanding
officer
s
room
of
the
garrison
and
the
afternoon
sun
slanting
through
the
square
of
the
window
fell
upon
the
maps
and
papers
before
him
he
had
sent
for
me
i
halted
in
sheer
embarrassment
on
the
threshold
looked
up
at
his
face
and
came
on
troubled
davy
he
said
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
kentucky
i
should
like
to
stay
to
the
end
colonel
i
answered
the
end
he
said
this
is
the
and
detroit
sir
i
returned
detroit
he
cried
bitterly
a
man
of
sense
measures
his
force
and
does
not
try
the
impossible
i
could
as
soon
march
against
philadelphia
this
is
the
end
i
say
and
the
general
must
give
way
to
the
politician
and
may
god
have
mercy
on
the
politician
who
will
try
to
keep
a
people
s
affection
without
money
or
help
from
he
fell
back
wearily
in
his
chair
while
i
stood
astonished
wondering
i
had
thought
to
find
him
elated
with
victory
congress
or
virginia
said
he
will
have
to
pay
monsieur
vigo
and
father
gibault
and
monsieur
gratiot
and
the
other
good
people
who
have
trusted
me
do
you
think
they
will
do
so
the
congress
are
far
from
here
i
said
ay
he
answered
too
far
to
care
about
you
and
me
and
what
we
have
he
ended
abruptly
and
sat
for
a
while
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
figures
crossing
and
recrossing
the
muddy
tom
mcchesney
goes
to
kentucky
with
letters
to
the
county
lieutenant
you
are
to
go
with
him
and
then
i
shall
have
no
one
to
remind
me
when
i
am
hungry
and
bring
me
hominy
i
shall
have
no
financier
no
strategist
for
a
tight
he
smiled
a
little
sadly
at
my
sorrowful
look
and
then
drew
me
to
him
and
patted
my
shoulder
it
is
no
place
for
a
young
lad
an
idle
garrison
i
think
he
continued
presently
i
think
you
have
a
future
david
if
you
do
not
lose
your
head
kentucky
will
grow
and
conquer
and
in
twenty
years
be
a
thriving
community
and
presently
you
will
go
to
virginia
and
study
law
and
come
back
again
do
you
hear
yes
and
i
would
tell
you
one
thing
said
he
with
force
serve
the
people
as
all
true
men
should
in
a
republic
but
do
not
rely
upon
their
gratitude
you
will
remember
that
yes
a
long
time
he
paused
looking
on
me
with
a
significance
i
did
not
then
understand
and
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
showed
no
trace
of
emotion
save
in
the
note
of
it
you
have
been
a
faithful
friend
davy
when
i
needed
loyalty
perhaps
the
time
may
come
again
promise
me
that
you
will
not
forget
me
if
i
am
unfortunate
sir
i
exclaimed
davy
he
said
and
god
bless
you
i
have
work
to
still
i
hesitated
he
stared
at
me
but
with
kindness
what
is
it
davy
he
asked
please
sir
i
said
if
i
might
take
my
drum
at
that
he
laughed
you
may
said
he
you
may
perchance
we
may
need
it
i
went
out
from
his
presence
vaguely
troubled
to
find
tom
and
before
the
early
sun
had
set
we
were
gliding
down
the
wabash
in
a
canoe
past
places
forever
dedicated
to
our
agonies
towards
kentucky
and
polly
ann
davy
said
tom
i
reckon
she
ll
be
standin
under
the
simmon
tree
waitin
fer
us
with

in
her
and
so
she

in
the

the
eden
of

man
may
be
the
inferno
of
his
neighbor
and
now
i
am
to
throw
to
the
winds
like
leaves
of
a
worthless
manuscript
some
years
of
time
and
introduce
you
to
a
new
kentucky
a
kentucky
that
was
not
for
the
pioneer
one
page
of
this
manuscript
might
have
told
of
a
fearful
winter
when
the
snow
lay
in
great
drifts
in
the
bare
woods
when
tom
and
i
fashioned
canoes
or
noggins
out
of
the
great
roots
when
a
new
and
feminine
bit
of
humanity
cried
in
the
bark
cradle
and
polly
ann
sewed
deer
leather
another
page
nay
a
dozen
could
be
filled
with
indian
horrors
ambuscades
and
massacres
and
also
i
might
have
told
how
there
drifted
into
this
land
hitherto
unsoiled
the
refuse
cast
off
by
the
older
colonies
i
must
add
quickly
that
we
got
more
than
our
share
of
their
best
stock
along
with
this
no
sooner
had
the
sun
begun
to
pit
the
snow
hillocks
than
wild
creatures
came
in
from
the
mountains
haggard
with
hunger
and
hardship
they
had
left
their
homes
in
virginia
and
the
carolinas
in
the
autumn
an
unheralded
winter
of
arctic
fierceness
had
caught
them
in
its
grip
bitter
tales
they
told
of
wives
and
children
buried
among
the
rocks
fast
on
the
heels
of
these
wretched
ones
trooped
the
spring
settlers
in
droves
and
i
have
seen
whole
churches
march
singing
into
the
forts
the
preacher
leading
and
thanking
god
loudly
that
he
had
delivered
them
from
the
wilderness
and
the
savage
the
little
forts
would
not
hold
them
and
they
went
out
to
hew
clearings
from
the
forest
and
to
build
cabins
and
stockades
and
our
own
people
starved
and
snowbound
went
out
likewise
tom
and
polly
ann
and
their
little
family
and
myself
to
the
farm
at
the
and
while
the
water
flowed
between
the
stumps
over
the
black
land
we
planted
and
ploughed
and
prayed
always
alert
watching
north
and
south
against
the
coming
of
the
indians
but
tom
was
no
husbandman
he
and
his
kind
were
the
scouts
the
advance
guard
of
civilization
not
tillers
of
the
soil
or
lovers
of
close
communities
farther
and
farther
they
went
afield
for
game
and
always
they
grumbled
sorely
against
this
horde
which
had
driven
the
deer
from
his
cover
and
the
buffalo
from
his
wallow
looking
back
i
can
recall
one
evening
when
the
long
summer
twilight
lingered
to
a
close
tom
was
lounging
lazily
against
the
big
persimmon
tree
smoking
his
pipe
the
two
children
digging
at
the
roots
and
polly
ann
seated
on
the
sewing
as
i
drew
near
she
looked
up
at
me
from
her
work
she
was
a
woman
upon
whose
eternal
freshness
industry
made
no
mar
davy
she
exclaimed
how
ye
ve
growed
i
thought
ye
d
be
a
wizened
little
body
but
this
year
ye
ve
shot
up
like
a
my
father
was
six
feet
two
inches
in
his
moccasins
i
said
he
ll
be
wallopin
me
soon
said
tom
with
a
grin
he
took
a
long
whiff
at
his
pipe
and
added
thoughtfully
i
reckon
this
ain
t
no
place
fer
me
now
with
all
the
settler
folks
and
comin
through
the
tom
said
i
there
s
a
bit
of
a
fall
on
the
river
ay
he
said
and
nary
a
fish
something
better
i
answered
we
ll
put
a
dam
there
and
a
mill
and
a
hominy
and
make
our
fortune
grinding
corn
for
the
settlers
cried
polly
ann
showing
a
line
of
very
white
teeth
i
always
said
ye
d
be
a
rich
man
tom
was
mildly
interested
and
went
with
us
at
daylight
to
measure
the
fall
and
he
allowed
that
he
would
have
the
more
time
to
hunt
if
the
mill
were
a
success
for
a
month
i
had
had
the
scheme
in
my
mind
where
the
dam
was
to
be
put
the
race
and
the
wondrous
wheel
rimmed
with
cow
horns
to
dip
the
water
and
fixed
on
the
wheel
there
was
to
be
a
crank
that
worked
the
pounder
in
the
mortar
so
we
were
to
grind
until
i
could
arrange
with
scarlett
the
new
storekeeper
in
harrodstown
to
have
two
fetched
across
the
mountains
while
the
corn
ripened
and
the
melons
swelled
and
the
flax
flowered
our
axes
rang
by
the
river
s
side
and
sometimes
as
we
worked
cowan
and
terrell
and
mccann
and
other
long
hunters
would
come
and
jeer
because
we
were
turning
civilized
often
they
gave
us
a
lift
it
was
september
when
the
millstones
arrived
and
i
spent
a
joyous
morning
of
final
bargaining
with
myron
scarlett
this
scarlett
was
from
connecticut
had
been
a
quartermaster
in
the
army
and
at
much
risk
brought
ploughs
and
hardware
and
scissors
and
buttons
and
broadcloth
and
corduroy
across
the
alleghanies
and
down
the
ohio
in
flatboats
these
he
sold
at
great
profit
we
had
no
money
not
even
the
worthless
scrip
that
congress
issued
but
a
beaver
skin
was
worth
eighteen
shillings
a
bearskin
ten
and
a
fox
or
a
deer
or
a
wildcat
less
half
the
village
watched
the
barter
the
rest
lounged
sullenly
about
the
land
court
the
land
court
curse
of
kentucky
it
was
just
a
windowless
log
house
built
outside
the
walls
our
temple
of
avarice
the
case
was
this
henderson
for
whose
company
daniel
boone
cut
the
wilderness
road
believed
that
he
had
bought
the
country
and
issued
grants
therefor
tom
held
one
of
these
grants
alas
and
many
others
whom
i
knew
virginia
repudiated
henderson
speculators
bought
acre
upon
acre
and
tract
upon
tract
from
the
state
and
crossed
the
mountains
to
extort
claims
conflicted
titles
lapped
there
was
the
court
set
in
the
sunlight
in
the
midst
of
a
fair
land
held
by
the
shameless
thronged
day
after
day
by
the
homeless
and
the
needy
jostling
quarrelling
beseeching
even
as
i
looked
upon
this
strife
a
man
stood
beside
me
drat
em
said
the
stranger
as
he
watched
a
extortioner
in
drab
for
these
did
not
condescend
to
hunting
shirts
drat
em
ef
i
had
my
way
i
d
wring
the
neck
of
every
mother
s
son
of
i
turned
with
a
start
and
there
was
daniel
boone
howdy
davy
he
said
ye
ve
growed
some
sence
ye
ve
ben
with
he
paused
and
then
continued
in
the
same
strain
tis
the
same
at
boonesboro
and
up
thar
at
the
falls
settlement
the
critters
is
everywhar
robbin
men
of
their
claims
davy
said
boone
earnestly
you
know
that
i
come
into
kaintuckee
when
it
waren
t
nothin
but
wilderness
and
resked
my
life
time
and
again

redskins
they

robbed
me
already
of
half
my
robbed
you
i
exclaimed
indignant
that
he
of
all
men
should
suffer
ay
he
said
robbed
me
they
ve
took
one
claim
after
another
tracts
that
i
staked
out
long
afore
they
heerd
of
he
rubbed
his
rifle
barrel
with
his
buckskin
sleeve
i
get
a
little
for
my
skins
and
a
little
by
surveyin
but
when
the
game
goes
i
reckon
i
ll
go
after
where
boone
i
asked
whar
whar
the
varmints
cyant
foller
acrost
the
mississippi
into
the
spanish
and
leave
kentucky
i
cried
davy
he
answered
sadly
you
kin
cope
with
em
they
tell
me
you
re
buildin
a
mill
up
at
mcchesney
s
and
i
reckon
you
re
as
cute
as
any
of
em
they
beat
me
i
m
good
for
nothin
but
shootin
and
explorin
we
stood
silent
for
a
while
our
attention
caught
by
a
quarrel
which
had
suddenly
come
out
of
the
doorway
one
of
the
men
was
jim
willis
my
friend
of
clark
s
campaign
who
had
a
henderson
claim
near
shawanee
springs
the
other
was
the
man
of
whom
boone
had
spoken
and
fragments
of
their
curses
reached
us
where
we
stood
the
hunting
shirts
surged
around
them
alert
now
at
the
prospect
of
a
fight
men
came
running
in
from
all
directions
and
shouts
of
hang
him
tomahawk
him
were
heard
on
every
side
boone
did
not
move
it
was
a
common
enough
spectacle
for
him
and
he
was
not
excitable
moreover
he
knew
that
the
death
of
one
extortioner
more
or
less
would
have
no
effect
on
the
system
they
had
become
as
the
fowls
of
the
air
i
was
acrost
the
mountain
last
month
said
boone
presently
and
one
of
them
skunks
had
stole
campbell
s
silver
spoons
at
abingdon
campbell
was
out
arter
him
for
a
week
with
a
coil
of
rope
on
his
saddle
but
the
varmint
got
to
boone
wished
me
luck
in
my
new
enterprise
bade
me
and
set
out
for
redstone
where
he
was
to
measure
a
tract
for
a
revolutioner
the
speculator
having
been
rescued
from
jim
willis
s
clutches
by
the
sheriff
the
crowd
helped
us
load
our
stones
between
and
some
of
them
followed
us
all
the
way
home
that
they
might
see
the
grinding
half
of
mcafee
s
new
station
had
heard
the
news
and
came
over
likewise
and
from
that
day
we
ground
as
much
corn
as
could
be
brought
to
us
from
miles
around
polly
ann
and
i
ran
the
mill
and
kept
the
accounts
often
of
a
crisp
autumn
morning
we
heard
a
above
the
tumbling
of
the
water
and
found
a
wild
turkey
perched
on
top
of
the
hopper
eating
his
fill
some
of
our
meat
we
got
that
way
as
for
tom
he
was
off
and
on
when
the
roving
spirit
seized
him
he
made
journeys
to
the
westward
with
cowan
and
ray
generally
they
returned
with
packs
of
skins
but
sometimes
soberly
thanking
heaven
that
their
hair
was
left
growing
on
their
heads
this
and
patrolling
the
wilderness
road
and
other
militia
duties
made
up
tom
s
life
no
sooner
was
the
mill
fairly
started
than
off
he
went
to
the
cumberland
i
mention
this
not
alone
because
i
remember
well
the
day
of
his
return
but
because
of
a
certain
happening
then
that
had
a
heavy
influence
on
my
after
life
the
episode
deals
with
an
gentleman
named
potts
who
was
the
agent
for
a
certain
major
colfax
of
virginia
tom
owned
under
a
henderson
grant
the
major
had
been
given
this
and
other
lands
for
his
services
in
the
war
potts
arrived
one
rainy
afternoon
and
found
me
standing
alone
under
the
little
that
covered
the
hopper
how
we
served
him
with
the
aid
of
mccann
and
cowan
and
other
neighbors
and
how
we
were
near
getting
into
trouble
because
of
the
prank
will
be
seen
later
the
next
morning
i
rode
into
harrodstown
not
wholly
easy
in
my
mind
concerning
the
wisdom
of
the
thing
i
had
done
there
was
no
one
to
advise
me
for
colonel
clark
was
far
away
building
a
fort
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
tom
had
laughed
at
the
consequences
he
cared
little
about
his
land
and
was
for
moving
into
the
wilderness
again
but
for
polly
ann
s
sake
i
wished
that
we
had
treated
the
land
agent
less
cavalierly
i
was
soon
distracted
from
these
thoughts
by
the
sight
of
harrodstown
itself
i
had
no
sooner
ridden
out
of
the
forest
shade
when
i
saw
that
the
place
was
in
an
uproar
men
and
women
gathering
in
groups
and
running
here
and
there
between
the
cabins
urging
on
the
mare
i
cantered
across
the
fields
and
the
first
person
i
met
was
james
ray
what
s
the
matter
i
asked
matter
enough
an
army
of
redskins
has
crossed
the
ohio
and
not
a
man
to
take
command
my
god
cried
ray
pointing
angrily
at
the
swarms
about
the
land
office
what
trash
we
have
got
this
last
year
kentucky
can
go
to
the
devil
half
the
stations
be
wiped
out
and
not
a
thrip
do
they
have
you
sent
word
to
the
colonel
i
asked
if
he
was
here
said
ray
bitterly
he
d
have
half
of
em
swinging
inside
of
an
hour
i
ll
warrant
he
d
send
em
to
the
i
rode
on
into
the
town
potts
gone
out
of
my
mind
apart
from
the
crowds
and
looking
on
in
silent
rage
stood
a
group
of
the
old
settlers
tall
lean
powerful
yet
impotent
for
lack
of
a
leader
a
contrast
they
were
these
pioneers
to
the
humanity
they
watched
absorbed
in
struggles
for
the
very
lands
they
had
won
by
the
eternal
said
jack
terrell
if
the
yea
th
was
ter
swaller
em
up
they
d
keep
on
in
something

got
to
be
done
captain
harrod
put
in
gloomily
the
red
varmints
ll
be
on
us
in
another
day
in
god

whar

clark
hold
cried
fletcher
blount
what
s
that
the
broiling
about
the
land
court
too
was
suddenly
hushed
men
stopped
in
their
tracks
staring
fixedly
at
three
forms
which
had
come
out
of
the
woods
into
the
clearing
redskins
or
there
s
no
devil
said
terrell
redskins
they
were
but
not
the
blanketed
kind
that
drifted
every
day
through
the
station
their
gleamed
in
the
light
and
the
white
edges
of
the
feathered
caught
the
sun
one
held
up
in
his
right
hand
a
white
belt
token
of
peace

fletcher
blount

chickasaws
by

said
terrell
davy
you
ve
got
a
hoss
ride
out
and
look
em
nothing
loath
i
put
the
mare
into
a
gallop
and
i
passed
over
the
very
place
where
polly
ann
had
picked
me
up
and
saved
my
life
long
since
the
indians
came
on
at
a
dog
trot
but
when
they
were
within
fifty
paces
of
me
they
halted
abruptly
the
chief
waved
the
white
belt
around
his
head
davy
says
he
and
i
trembled
from
head
to
foot
how
well
i
knew
that
voice
colonel
clark
i
cried
and
rode
up
to
him
thank
god
you
are
come
sir
said
i
for
the
people
here
are
and
the
northern
indians
are
crossing
the
he
took
my
bridle
and
leading
the
horse
began
to
walk
rapidly
towards
the
station
ay
he
answered
i
know
it
a
runner
came
to
me
with
the
tidings
where
i
was
building
a
fort
on
the
mississippi
and
i
took
willis
here
and
saunders
and
i
glanced
at
my
old
friends
who
grinned
at
me
through
the
on
their
faces
we
reached
a
ditch
through
which
the
rain
of
the
night
before
was
draining
from
the
fields
clark
dropped
the
bridle
stooped
down
and
rubbed
his
face
clean
up
he
got
again
and
flung
the
feathers
from
his
head
and
i
thought
that
his
eyes
twinkled
despite
the
sternness
of
his
look
davy
my
lad
said
he
you
and
i
have
seen
some
strange
things
together
perchance
we
shall
see
stranger
a
shout
went
up
for
he
had
been
recognized
and
captain
harrod
and
ray
and
terrell
and
cowan
who
had
just
ridden
in
ran
up
to
greet
him
and
press
his
hand
he
called
them
each
by
name
these
men
whose
loyalty
had
been
proved
but
said
no
word
more
nor
paused
in
his
stride
until
he
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
mob
about
the
land
court
there
he
stood
for
a
full
minute
and
we
who
knew
him
looked
on
silently
and
waited
the
turmoil
had
begun
again
the
speculators
calling
out
in
strident
tones
the
settlers
bargaining
and
pushing
and
all
clamoring
to
be
heard
while
there
was
money
to
be
made
or
land
to
be
got
they
had
no
ear
for
the
public
weal
a
man
shouldered
his
way
through
roughly
and
they
gave
back
cursing
surprised
he
reached
the
door
and
flinging
those
who
blocked
it
right
and
left
entered
there
he
was
recognized
and
his
name
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
clark
he
walked
up
to
the
table
strewn
with
books
and
deeds
silence
he
thundered
but
there
was
no
need
they
were
still
for
once
this
court
is
closed
he
cried
while
kentucky
is
in
danger
not
a
deed
shall
be
signed
nor
an
acre
granted
until
i
come
back
from
the
ohio
out
you
go
out
they
went
indeed
judge
brokers
speculators
the
evicted
and
the
triumphant
together
and
when
the
place
was
empty
clark
turned
the
key
and
thrust
it
into
his
hunting
shirt
he
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
step
and
his
eyes
swept
the
crowd
now
he
said
there
have
been
many
to
claim
this
land
who
will
follow
me
to
defend
it
as
i
live
they
cheered
him
hands
were
flung
up
that
were
past
counting
and
men
who
were
barely
rested
from
the
hardships
of
the
wilderness
trail
shouted
their
readiness
to
go
but
others
slunk
away
and
were
found
that
morning
grumbling
and
cursing
the
chance
that
had
brought
them
to
kentucky
within
the
hour
the
news
had
spread
to
the
farms
and
men
rode
in
to
harrodstown
to
tell
the
colonel
of
many
who
were
leaving
the
plough
in
the
furrow
and
the
axe
in
the
wood
and
starting
off
across
the
mountains
in
anger
and
fear
the
colonel
turned
to
me
as
he
sat
writing
down
the
names
of
the
volunteers
davy
said
he
when
you
are
grown
you
shall
not
stay
at
home
i
promise
you
take
your
mare
and
ride
as
for
your
life
to
mcchesney
and
tell
him
to
choose
ten
men
and
go
to
the
crab
orchard
on
the
wilderness
road
tell
him
for
me
to
turn
back
every
man
woman
and
child
who
tries
to
leave
i
met
tom
coming
in
from
the
field
with
his
rawhide
harness
over
his
shoulders
polly
ann
stood
calling
him
in
the
door
and
the
squirrel
broth
was
steaming
on
the
table
he
did
not
wait
for
it
kissing
her
he
flung
himself
into
the
saddle
i
had
left
and
we
watched
him
mutely
as
he
waved
back
to
us
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
in
the
night
i
found
myself
sitting
up
in
bed
listening
to
a
running
and
stamping
near
the
cabin
polly
ann
was
stirring
davy
she
whispered
the
stock
is
we
peered
out
of
the
loophole
together
and
through
the
little
orchard
we
had
planted
the
moon
flooded
the
fields
and
beyond
it
the
forest
was
a
dark
blur
i
can
recall
the
scene
now
the
rude
mill
standing
by
the
the
twisted
rail
fences
and
the
black
silhouettes
of
the
horses
and
cattle
as
they
stood
bunched
together
behind
us
little
tom
stirred
in
his
sleep
and
startled
us
that
very
evening
polly
ann
had
frightened
him
into
obedience
by
telling
him
that
the
shawanees
would
get
him
what
was
there
to
do
mcafee
s
station
was
four
miles
away
and
ray
s
clearing
two
ray
was
gone
with
tom
i
could
not
leave
polly
ann
alone
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
silently
that
the
children
might
not
be
waked
and
lurking
savage
might
not
hear
we
put
the
powder
and
bullets
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
loaded
the
guns
and
pistols
for
polly
ann
had
learned
to
shoot
she
took
the
loopholes
of
two
sides
of
the
cabin
i
of
the
other
two
and
then
began
the
fearful
watching
and
waiting
which
the
frontier
knows
so
well
suddenly
the
cattle
stirred
again
and
stampeded
to
the
other
corner
of
the
field
there
came
a
whisper
from
polly
ann
what
is
it
i
answered
running
over
to
her
look
out
she
said
what
d
ye
see
near
the
mill
her
sharp
eyes
had
not
deceived
her
for
mine
perceived
plainly
a
dark
form
skulking
in
the
hickory
grove
next
a
movement
behind
the
rail
fence
and
darting
back
to
my
side
of
the
house
i
made
out
a
long
black
body
wriggling
at
the
edge
of
the
withered
they
were
surrounding
us
how
i
wished
that
tom
were
home
a
stealthy
sound
began
to
intrude
itself
upon
our
ears
listening
intently
i
thought
it
came
from
the
side
of
the
cabin
where
the
was
where
we
stored
our
wood
in
winter
the
black
shadow
fell
on
that
side
and
into
a
patch
of
bushes
peering
out
of
the
loophole
i
could
perceive
nothing
there
the
noise
went
on
at
intervals
all
at
once
there
grew
on
me
with
horror
the
discovery
that
there
was
digging
under
the
cabin
how
long
the
sound
continued
i
know
not
it
might
have
been
an
hour
it
might
have
been
less
now
i
thought
i
heard
it
under
the
wall
now
beneath
the
puncheons
of
the
floor
the
pitchy
blackness
within
was
such
that
we
could
not
see
the
boards
moving
and
therefore
we
must
needs
kneel
down
and
feel
them
from
time
to
time
yes
this
one
was
lifting
from
its
bed
on
the
hard
earth
beneath
i
was
sure
of
it
it
rose
an
inch
then
an
inch
more
gripping
the
handle
of
my
tomahawk
i
prayed
for
guidance
in
my
stroke
for
the
blade
might
go
wild
in
the
darkness
upward
crept
the
board
and
suddenly
it
was
gone
from
the
floor
i
swung
a
full
circle
and
to
my
horror
i
felt
the
axe
plunging
into
soft
flesh
and
crunching
on
a
bone
i
had
missed
the
head
a
yell
shattered
the
night
as
the
puncheon
fell
with
a
rattle
on
the
boards
and
my
tomahawk
was
gone
from
my
hand
without
the
fierce
of
the
shawanees
that
i
knew
so
well
echoed
around
the
log
walls
and
the
door
trembled
with
a
blow
the
children
awoke
crying
there
was
no
time
to
think
my
great
fear
was
that
the
devil
in
the
cabin
would
kill
polly
ann
just
then
i
heard
her
calling
out
to
me
hide
i
cried
hide
under
the
has
he
got
you
i
heard
her
answer
and
then
the
sound
of
a
scuffle
that
maddened
me
knife
in
hand
i
crept
slowly
about
and
put
my
fingers
on
a
man
s
neck
and
side
next
polly
ann
careened
against
me
and
i
lost
him
again
davy
davy
i
heard
her
gasp
look
out
fer
the
floor
it
was
too
late
the
puncheon
rose
under
me
i
stumbled
and
it
fell
again
once
more
the
awful
changing
notes
of
the
sounded
without
a
body
bumped
on
the
boards
a
white
light
rose
before
my
eyes
and
a
sharp
pain
leaped
in
my
side
then
all
was
black
again
but
i
had
my
senses
still
and
my
fingers
closed
around
the
knotted
muscles
of
an
arm
i
thrust
the
pistol
in
my
hand
against
flesh
and
fired
two
of
us
fell
together
but
the
thought
of
polly
ann
got
me
staggering
to
my
feet
again
calling
her
name
by
the
grace
of
god
i
heard
her
answer
are
ye
hurt
davy
no
said
i
no
and
you
we
drifted
together
twas
she
who
had
the
presence
of
mind
the
chest
quick
the
chest
we
stumbled
over
a
body
in
reaching
it
we
seized
the
handles
and
with
all
our
strength
hauled
it
athwart
the
loose
puncheon
that
seemed
to
be
lifting
even
then
a
mighty
splintering
shook
the
door
to
the
ports
cried
polly
ann
as
our
heads
knocked
together
to
find
the
rifles
and
prime
them
seemed
to
take
an
age
next
i
was
staring
through
the
loophole
along
a
barrel
and
beyond
it
were
three
black
forms
in
line
on
a
long
beam
i
think
we
fired
polly
ann
and
i
at
the
same
time
one
fell
we
saw
a
comedy
of
the
beam
dropping
heavily
on
the
foot
of
another
and
he
limping
off
with
a
guttural
howl
of
rage
and
pain
i
fired
a
pistol
at
him
but
missed
him
and
then
i
was
ramming
a
powder
charge
down
the
long
barrel
of
the
rifle
suddenly
there
was
silence
even
the
children
had
ceased
crying
outside
in
the
dooryard
a
feathered
figure
writhed
like
a
snake
towards
the
fence
the
moon
still
etched
the
picture
in
black
and
white
shots
awoke
me
i
think
distant
shots
and
they
sounded
like
the
ripping
and
tearing
of
cloth
for
a
wound
twas
no
new
sound
to
me
davy
dear
said
a
voice
tenderly
out
of
the
mist
the
face
of
polly
ann
bent
over
me
i
put
up
my
hand
and
dropped
it
again
with
a
cry
then
my
senses
coming
with
a
rush
the
familiar
objects
of
the
cabin
outlined
themselves
tom
s
winter
hunting
shirt
polly
ann
s
woollen
shift
and
sunbonnet
on
their
pegs
the
big
stone
chimney
the
ladder
to
the
loft
the
closed
door
with
a
long
jagged
line
across
it
where
the
wood
was
splintered
and
dearest
of
all
the
chubby
forms
of
peggy
and
little
tom
playing
on
the
then
my
glance
wandered
to
the
floor
and
on
the
puncheons
were
three
stains
i
closed
my
eyes
again
came
a
rattle
like
stones
falling
from
a
great
height
down
a
rocky
bluff
what
s
that
i
whispered
they
re
fighting
at
mcafee
s
station
said
polly
ann
she
put
her
cool
hand
on
my
head
and
little
tom
climbed
up
on
the
bed
and
looked
up
into
my
face
wistfully
calling
my
name
oh
davy
said
his
mother
i
thought
ye
were
never
coming
and
the
redskins
i
asked
she
drew
the
child
away
lest
he
hurt
me
and
shuddered
i
reckon
twas
only
a
she
answered
the
rest
is
at
mcafee
s
and
if
they
beat
em
off
she
stopped
abruptly
we
shall
be
saved
i
said
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
polly
ann
left
my
side
only
to
feed
the
children
and
to
keep
watch
out
of
the
loopholes
and
i
lay
on
my
back
listening
and
listening
to
the
shots
at
last
these
became
scattered
then
though
we
strained
our
ears
we
heard
them
no
more
was
the
fort
taken
the
sun
slid
across
the
heavens
and
shot
narrow
blades
of
light
now
through
one
loophole
and
now
through
another
until
a
ray
slanted
from
the
western
wall
and
rested
upon
the
paint
of
two
dead
bodies
in
the
corner
i
stared
with
horror
i
was
afeard
to
open
the
door
and
throw
em
out
said
polly
ann
apologetically
still
i
stared
one
of
them
had
a
great
cleft
across
his
face
but
i
thought
i
hit
him
in
the
shoulder
i
exclaimed
polly
ann
thrust
her
hand
gently
across
my
eyes
davy
ye
mustn
t
talk

said
that
s
a
drowsiness
seized
me
but
i
resisted
you
killed
him
polly
ann
i
murmured

said
polly
ann
and
i
slept
again

prime

she
tom
picked
up
his
rifle
and
they
went
out
together
i
lay
for
a
long
time
reflecting
to
the
strange
guests
whom
tom
in
the
kindness
of
his
heart
had
brought
back
and
befriended
i
gave
little
attention
i
was
overwhelmed
by
the
love
which
had
just
been
revealed
to
me
and
so
i
was
to
be
educated
it
had
been
in
my
mind
these
many
years
but
i
had
never
spoken
of
it
to
polly
ann
dear
polly
ann
my
eyes
filled
at
the
thought
that
she
herself
had
determined
upon
this
sacrifice
there
were
footsteps
at
the
door
and
these
i
heard
and
heeded
not
then
there
came
a
voice
a
woman
s
voice
modulated
and
trained
in
the
perfections
of
speech
and
in
the
art
of
treating
things
lightly
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
i
caught
my
breath
what
a
pastoral
harry
if
we
have
sought
for
virtue
in
the
wilderness
we
have
found
when
have
we
ever
sought
for
virtue
sarah
it
was
the
man
who
answered
and
stirred
another
chord
of
my
memory
when
indeed
said
the
woman
tis
a
luxury
that
is
denied
us
i
fear
egad
we
have
run
the
gamut
all
but
i
thought
the
woman
sighed
our
hosts
are
gone
out
she
said
bless
their
simple
souls
tis
arcady
harry
where
thieves
do
not
break
in
and
that
s
biblical
isn
t
it
she
paused
and
joined
in
the
man
s
laugh
i
remember
she
stopped
abruptly
thieves
said
he
not
in
our
sense
and
yet
a
fortnight
ago
this
sylvan
retreat
was
the
scene
of
murder
and
sudden
yes
indians
said
the
woman
but
they
are
beaten
off
and
forgotten
troubles
do
not
last
here
did
you
see
the
boy
he
s
in
there
in
the
corner
getting
well
of
a
fearful
hacking
mcchesney
says
he
saved
her
and
her
ay
mcchesney
told
me
said
the
man
let
s
have
a
peep
at
in
they
came
and
i
looked
on
the
woman
and
would
have
leaped
from
my
bed
had
the
strength
been
in
me
superb
she
was
though
her
travelling
gown
of
green
cloth
was
frayed
and
torn
by
the
briers
and
the
beauty
of
her
face
enhanced
by
the
marks
of
i
know
not
what
trials
and
emotions
little
lines
under
the
eyes
were
nigh
robbing
these
of
the
haughtiness
i
had
once
seen
and
hated
set
high
on
her
hair
was
a
curving
green
hat
with
a
feather
to
the
wilderness
i
looked
on
the
man
he
was
as
as
she
a
london
tailor
must
have
cut
his
suit
of
gray
a
single
band
of
linen
soiled
by
the
journey
was
wound
about
his
throat
and
i
remember
oddly
the
buttons
stuck
on
his
knees
and
cuffs
and
these
in
a
pattern
of
lighter
gray
some
had
been
torn
off
as
for
his
face
twas
as
handsome
as
ever
for
dissipation
sat
well
upon
it
my
thoughts
flew
back
to
that
day
long
gone
when
a
friendless
boy
rode
up
a
long
drive
to
a
pillared
mansion
i
saw
again
the
picture
the
horse
with
the
craning
neck
the
liveried
servant
at
the
bridle
the
listless
young
gentleman
with
the
shiny
boots
reclining
on
the
and
above
him
under
the
portico
the
grand
lady
whose
laugh
had
made
me
sad
and
i
remembered
too
the
wild
neglected
lad
who
had
been
to
me
as
a
brother
and
generous
who
had
shared
what
he
had
with
a
foundling
who
had
wept
with
me
in
my
first
great
sorrow
where
was
he
for
i
was
face
to
face
once
more
with
temple
and
harry
riddle
the
lady
started
as
she
gazed
at
me
and
her
tired
eyes
widened
she
clutched
riddle
s
arm
harry
she
cried
harry
he
puts
me
in
mind
of
of
some
one
i
can
not
riddle
laughed
nervously
there
there
sally
says
he
all
brats
resemble
somebody
i
have
heard
you
say
so
a
dozen
she
turned
upon
him
an
appealing
glance
oh
she
said
with
a
little
catch
of
her
breath
is
there
no
such
thing
as
oblivion
is
there
a
place
in
the
world
that
is
not
haunted
i
am
cursed
with
or
the
lack
of
it
answered
riddle
pulling
out
a
silver
from
his
pocket
and
staring
at
it
ruefully
damme
the
snuff
i
fetched
from
paris
is
gone
all
but
a
pinch
here
is
a
real
it
was
the
same
in
rome
the
lady
continued
unheeding
when
we
met
the
izards
and
at
venice
that
nasty
colonel
tarleton
saw
us
at
the
opera
in
london
we
must
needs
run
into
the
manners
from
maryland
in
paris
in
paris
we
were
safe
enough
riddle
threw
in
hastily
and
why
she
flashed
back
at
him
he
did
not
answer
that
a
truce
with
your
fancies
madam
said
he
behold
a
soul
of
good
nature
i
have
followed
you
through
half
the
civilized
countries
of
the
globe
none
of
them
are
good
enough
you
must
needs
cross
the
ocean
again
and
come
to
the
wilds
we
nearly
die
on
the
trail
are
picked
up
by
a
samaritan
in
buckskin
and
taken
into
the
bosom
of
his
worthy
family
and
forsooth
you
look
at
a
backwoods
urchin
and
are
nigh
to
hush
harry
she
cried
starting
forward
and
peering
into
my
face
he
will
hear
tut
said
harry
what
if
he
does
london
and
paris
are
words
to
him
we
might
as
well
be
speaking
french
and
i
ll
take
my
oath
he
s
the
corner
where
i
lay
was
dark
for
the
cabin
had
no
windows
and
if
my
life
had
depended
upon
speaking
i
could
have
found
no
fit
words
then
she
turned
from
me
and
her
mood
changed
swiftly
for
she
laughed
lightly
musically
and
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
perchance
i
am
she
said
they
are
not
ghosts
of
a
past
happiness
at
all
events
he
answered
she
sat
down
on
a
stool
before
the
hearth
and
clasping
her
fingers
upon
her
knee
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
embers
of
the
fire
presently
she
began
to
speak
in
a
low
even
voice
he
looking
down
at
her
his
feet
apart
his
hand
thrust
backward
towards
the
heat
harry
she
said
do
you
remember
all
our
contrivances
how
you
used
to
hold
my
hand
in
the
garden
under
the
table
while
i
talked
brazenly
to
mason
and
how
jealous
jack
temple
used
to
get
she
laughed
again
softly
always
looking
at
the
fire
damnably
jealous
agreed
riddle
and
yawned
served
him
devilish
right
for
marrying
you
and
he
was
a
blind
fool
for
five
long
yes
blind
the
lady
agreed
how
could
he
have
been
so
blind
how
well
i
recall
the
day
he
rode
after
us
in
the
twas
the
parson
told
curse
him
said
riddle
we
should
have
gone
that
night
if
your
courage
had
my
courage
she
cried
flashing
a
look
upwards
my
foresight
a
pretty
mess
we
had
made
of
it
without
my
inheritance
tis
small
enough
the
lord
knows
in
europe
we
should
have
been
dregs
we
should
have
starved
in
the
wilderness
with
you
he
looked
down
at
her
curiously
devilish
queer
talk
said
he
but
while
we
are
in
it
i
wonder
where
temple
is
now
he
got
aboard
the
king
s
frigate
with
a
price
on
his
head
williams
told
me
he
saw
him
in
london
at
white
s
have
have
you
ever
heard
sarah
she
shook
her
head
her
glance
returning
to
the
ashes
no
she
answered
faith
says
riddle
he
ll
scarce
turn
up
she
did
not
answer
that
but
sat
motionless
he
ll
scarce
turn
up
here
in
these
wilds
riddle
repeated
and
what
i
am
wondering
sarah
is
how
the
devil
we
are
to
live
how
do
these
good
people
live
who
helped
us
when
we
were
starving
riddle
flung
his
hand
eloquently
around
the
cabin
there
was
something
of
disgust
in
the
gesture
you
see
he
said
love
in
a
but
it
is
love
said
the
lady
in
a
low
tone
he
broke
into
laughter
sally
he
cried
i
have
visions
of
you
gracing
the
board
at
which
we
sat
patting
on
the
hearth
stewing
squirrel
broth
with
the
same
pride
that
you
once
planned
a
rout
cleaning
the
pots
and
pans
and
standing
anxious
at
the
doorway
staring
through
a
sunbonnet
for
your
lord
and
my
lord
and
master
said
the
lady
and
there
was
so
much
of
scorn
in
the
words
that
riddle
winced
come
he
said
i
grant
now
that
you
could
make
pans
shine
like
that
you
could
cook
bacon
to
a
turn
although
i
would
have
laid
an
hundred
guineas
against
it
some
years
ago
what
then
are
you
to
be
contented
with
four
log
walls
with
the
intellectual
companionship
of
the
mcchesneys
and
their
friends
are
you
to
depend
for
excitement
upon
the
chances
of
having
the
hair
neatly
cut
from
your
head
by
red
fiends
come
we
ll
go
back
to
the
rue
dominique
to
the
suppers
and
the
card
parties
of
the
countess
we
ll
be
rid
of
regrets
for
a
life
upon
which
we
have
turned
our
backs
she
shook
her
head
sadly
it
s
no
use
harry
said
she
we
ll
never
be
rid
of
we
ll
never
have
a
barony
like
temple
bow
and
races
every
week
and
gentry
round
about
but
damn
it
the
rebels
have
spoiled
all
that
since
the
those
are
not
the
regrets
i
mean
answered
temple
what
then
in
heaven
s
name
he
cried
you
were
not
wont
to
be
thus
but
now
i
vow
you
go
beyond
me
what
then
she
did
not
answer
but
sat
leaning
forward
over
the
hearth
he
staring
at
her
in
angry
perplexity
a
sound
broke
the
afternoon
stillness
the
pattering
of
small
bare
feet
on
the
puncheons
a
tremor
shook
the
woman
s
shoulders
and
little
tom
stood
before
her
a
quaint
figure
in
a
butternut
smock
his
blue
eyes
questioning
he
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
then
a
strange
thing
happened
with
a
sudden
impulse
she
turned
and
flung
her
arms
about
the
boy
and
strained
him
to
her
and
kissed
his
brown
hair
he
struggled
but
when
she
released
him
he
sat
very
still
on
her
knee
looking
into
her
face
for
he
was
a
solemn
child
the
lady
smiled
at
him
and
there
were
two
splashes
like
raindrops
on
her
fair
cheeks
as
for
riddle
he
went
to
the
door
looked
out
and
took
a
last
pinch
of
snuff
here
is
the
mistress
of
the
house
coming
back
he
cried
and
singing
like
the
shepherdess
in
the
it
was
polly
ann
indeed
at
the
sound
of
his
mother
s
voice
little
tom
jumped
down
from
the
lady
s
lap
and
ran
past
riddle
at
the
door
temple
s
thoughts
were
gone
across
the
mountains
and
what

and
looked
compassionately
at
the
lady

the

have
smiled
bravely
had
the
strength

given
her
she
tried
and
then
with
a
shudder
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
oh

she
exclaimed

there
there
ma

she

she
brushed
her

with
her
sleeve
and
stepping
briskly
to
my
bed
bent
over
me
davy
she
said
davy
how
be
ye
davy
it
was
the
lady
s
voice
she
stood
facing
us
and
never
while
i
live
shall
i
forget
that
which
i
saw
in
her
eyes
some
resemblance
it
bore
to
the
look
of
the
hunted
deer
but
in
the
animal
it
is
dumb
appealing
understanding
made
the
look
of
the
woman
terrible
to
behold
understanding
ay
and
courage
for
she
did
not
lack
this
last
quality
polly
ann
gave
back
in
a
kind
of
dismay
and
i
shivered
yes
i
answered
i
am
david
you
you
dare
to
judge
me
she
cried
i
knew
not
why
she
said
this
to
judge
you
i
repeated
yes
to
judge
me
she
answered
i
know
you
david
ritchie
and
the
blood
that
runs
in
you
your
mother
was
a
foolish
saint
she
laughed
who
lifted
her
eyebrows
when
i
married
her
brother
john
temple
that
was
her
condemnation
of
me
and
it
stung
me
more
than
had
a
thousand
sermons
a
doting
saint
because
she
followed
your
father
into
the
mountain
wilds
to
her
death
for
a
whim
of
his
and
your
father
a
calvinist
fanatic
who
had
no
mercy
on
sin
save
for
that
particular
weakness
of
his
own
stop
temple
i
cried
lifting
up
in
bed
and
to
my
astonishment
she
was
silenced
looking
at
me
in
amazement
you
had
your
vengeance
when
i
came
to
you
when
you
turned
from
me
with
a
lift
of
your
shoulders
at
the
news
of
my
father
s
death
and
now
and
now
she
repeated
questioningly
now
i
thought
you
were
changed
i
said
slowly
for
the
excitement
was
telling
on
me
you
listened
she
said
i
pitied
oh
pity
she
cried
my
god
that
you
should
pity
me
she
straightened
and
summoned
all
the
spirit
that
was
in
her
i
would
rather
be
called
a
name
than
have
the
pity
of
you
and
you
can
not
change
it
temple
i
answered
and
fell
back
on
the
sheets
you
can
not
change
it
i
heard
myself
repeating
as
though
it
were
another
s
voice
and
i
knew
that
polly
ann
was
bending
over
me
and
calling
me
where
did
they
go
polly
ann
i
asked
acrost
the
mississippi
to
the
lands
of
the
spanish
king
said
polly
ann
and
where
in
those
dominions
i
demanded
john
saunders
took
em
as
far
as
the
falls
polly
ann
answered
he
lowed
they
was
goin
to
louis
but
they
never
said
a
word
i
reckon
they
ll
be
hunted
as
long
as
they
i
had
thought
of
them
much
as
i
lay
on
my
back
recovering
from
the
fever
the
fever
for
which
temple
was
to
blame
yet
i
bore
her
no
malice
and
many
other
thoughts
i
had
probing
back
into
childhood
memories
for
the
solving
of
problems

my

remembered
the
speech
that
he
had
used
and
taught
me
and
how
his

had
dubbed
him

the
severest
campaigns
in
history
received
a
grant
of
two
hundred
and
sixteen
acres
you
who
will
may
look
at
the
plat
made
by
william
clark
surveyor
for
the
board
of
commissioners
and
find
sixteen
acres
marked
for
thomas
mcchesney
in
section
and
two
hundred
more
in
section
section
fronted
the
ohio
some
distance
above
bear
grass
creek
and
was
of
course
on
the
illinois
shore
as
for
my
own
plots
some
miles
in
the
interior
i
never
saw
them
but
i
own
them
to
this
day
i
mention
these
things
as
bearing
on
the
story
of
my
life
with
which
i
must
get
on
and
therefore
i
may
not
dwell
upon
this
injustice
to
the
men
who
won
an
empire
and
were
flung
a
bone
long
afterwards
it
was
early
autumn
once
more
and
such
a
busy
week
we
had
had
at
the
mill
that
tom
was
perforce
obliged
to
remain
at
home
and
help
though
he
longed
to
be
gone
with
cowan
and
ray
to
the
southwest
up
rides
a
man
named
jarrott
flings
himself
from
his
horse
passes
the
time
of
day
as
he
watches
the
grinding
helps
tom
to
tie
up
a
sack
or
two
and
hands
him
a
paper
what
s
this
says
tom
staring
at
it
blankly
ye
won
t
blame
me
mac
answers
jarrott
somewhat
ashamed
of
his
rôle
of
tain
t
none
of
my
doin
read
it
davy
said
tom
giving
it
to
me
i
stopped
the
mill
and
unfolding
the
paper
read
i
remember
not
the
quaint
wording
of
it
save
that
it
was
and
generally
in
short
it
was
a
summons
for
tom
to
appear
before
the
court
at
danville
on
a
certain
day
in
the
following
week
and
i
made
out
that
a
neville
colfax
was
the
plaintiff
in
the
matter
and
that
the
suit
had
to
do
with
land
neville
colfax
i
exclaimed
that
s
the
man
for
whom
potts
was

tom
and
sat
him
down
on
the
drat

he
said
as
he
mounted
his
horse
again
here
s
luck
to
ye
the
remembrance
of
potts
weighed
heavily
upon
my
mind
during
the
next
week
perchance
tom
would
have
to
pay
for
this
prank
likewise
twas
indeed
a
foolish
childish
thing
to
have
done
and
i
might
have
known
that
it
would
only
have
put
off
the
evil
day
of
reckoning
since
then
by
reason
of
the
mill
site
and
the
business
we
got
by
it
the
land
had
become
the
most
valuable
in
that
part
of
the
country
had
i
known
colonel
clark
s
whereabouts
i
should
have
gone
to
him
for
advice
and
comfort
as
it
was
we
were
forced
to
await
the
issue
without
counsel
polly
ann
and
i
talked
it
over
many
times
while
tom
sat
morose
and
silent
in
a
corner
he
was
the
pioneer
pure
and
simple
afraid
of
no
man
red
or
white
in
open
combat
but
defenceless
in
such
matters
as
this
tis
davy
will
save
us
tom
said
polly
ann
with
the
l
arnin
he
s
got
while
the
corn
was
grindin
i
had
indeed
been
reading
at
the
mill
while
the
hopper
emptied
itself
such
odd
books
as
drifted
into
harrodstown
one
of
these
was
called
bacon
s
abridgment
it
dealt
with
law
and
it
puzzled
me
sorely
and
the
children
polly
ann
continued
ye
ll
not
make
me
pick
up
the
four
of
em
and
pack
it
to
louisiana
because
colfax
wants
the
land
we
ve
made
for
there
were
four
of
them
now
indeed
the
youngest
still
in
the
bark
cradle
in
the
corner
he
bore
a
no
less
illustrious
name
than
that
of
the
writer
of
these
chronicles
it
would
be
hard
to
say
which
was
the
more
troubled
tom
or
i
that
windy
morning
we
set
out
on
the
danville
trace
polly
ann
alone
had
been
serene
ay
and
smiling
and
hopeful
she
had
kissed
us
each
impartially
and
we
left
her
with
a
future
governor
of
kentucky
on
her
shoulder
tripping
lightly
down
to
the
mill
to
grind
the
mcgarrys
corn
when
the
forest
was
cleared
at
danville
justice
was
housed
first
she
was
not
the
serene
inexorable
dame
whom
we
have
seen
in
pictures
holding
her
scales
above
the
jars
of
earth
justice
at
danville
was
a
somewhat
quarrelsome
lady
who
decided
matters
oftenest
with
the
stroke
of
a
sword
there
was
a
certain
dignity
about
her
temple
withal
for
instance
if
a
judge
wore
linen
that
linen
must
not
be
soiled
nor
was
it
etiquette
for
a
judge
to
lay
his
own
hands
in
chastisement
on
contemptuous
persons
though
justice
at
danville
had
more
compassion
than
her
sisters
in
older
communities
upon
human
failings
there
was
a
temple
built
to
her
of
hewed
or
sawed
logs
nine
inches
thick
so
said
the
specifications
within
the
temple
was
a
rude
platform
which
served
as
a
bar
and
since
justice
is
supposed
to
carry
a
torch
in
her
hand
there
were
no
windows
nor
any
windows
in
the
jail
next
door
where
some
dozen
offenders
languished
on
the
afternoon
that
tom
and
i
rode
into
town
there
was
nothing
auspicious
in
the
appearance
of
danville
and
no
man
might
have
said
then
that
the
place
was
to
be
the
scene
of
portentous
conventions
which
were
to
decide
the
destiny
of
a
state
here
was
a
sprinkling
of
log
cabins
some
in
the
building
and
an
inn
by
courtesy
so
called
tom
and
i
would
have
preferred
to
sleep
in
the
woods
near
by
with
our
feet
to
the
blaze
this
was
partly
from
motives
of
economy
and
partly
because
tom
in
common
with
other
pioneers
held
an
inn
in
contempt
but
to
come
back
to
our
arrival
it
was
a
sunny
and
windy
afternoon
and
the
leaves
were
flying
in
the
air
around
the
was
a
familiar
buzzing
scene
the
backwoodsmen
lounging
against
the
wall
or
brawling
over
their
claims
the
sleek
agents
and
attorneys
and
half
a
dozen
of
a
newer
type
these
were
adventurous
young
gentlemen
of
family
some
of
them
lawyers
and
some
of
them
late
officers
in
the
continental
army
who
had
been
rewarded
with
grants
of
land
these
were
the
patrons
of
the
log
tavern
which
stood
near
by
with
the
blackened
stumps
around
it
where
there
was
much
and
roistering
ay
and
even
duelling
of
nights
thar
s
mac
cried
a
backwoodsman
who
was
sitting
on
the
steps
as
we
rode
up
howdy
mac
be
they
tryin
to
git
your
land
too
howdy
mac
said
a
dozen
more
paying
a
tribute
to
tom
s
popularity
and
some
of
them
greeted
me
is
this
whar
they
take
a
man
s
land
away
says
tom
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
open
door
tom
had
no
intention
of
uttering
a
witticism
but
his
words
were
followed
by
loud
guffaws
from
all
sides
even
the
lawyers
joining
in
i
reckon
this
is
the
place
tom
came
the
answer
i
reckon
i
ll
take
a
peep
in
thar
said
tom
leaping
off
his
horse
and
shouldering
his
way
to
the
door
i
followed
him
curious
the
building
was
half
full
two
elderly
gentlemen
of
grave
demeanor
sat
on
stools
behind
a
puncheon
table
and
near
them
a
young
man
was
writing
behind
the
young
man
was
a
young
gentleman
who
was
closing
a
speech
as
we
entered
and
he
had
spoken
with
such
vehemence
that
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
his
brow
there
was
a
murmur
from
those
listening
and
i
saw
tom
pressing
his
way
to
the
front
hev
any
of
ye
seen
a
feller
named
colfax
cries
tom
in
a
loud
voice
he
says
he
owns
the
land
i
settled
and
he
ain
t
ever
seed
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
and
even
the
judges
smiled
whar
is
he
cries
tom
said
he
d
be
here
another
gust
of
laughter
drowned
his
words
and
then
one
of
the
judges
got
up
and
rapped
on
the
table
the
gentleman
who
had
just
made
the
speech
glared
mightily
and
i
supposed
he
had
lost
the
effect
of
it
what
do
you
mean
by
interrupting
the
court
cried
the
judge
get
out
sir
or
i
ll
have
you
fined
for
tom
looked
dazed
but
at
that
moment
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
and
tom
turned
why
says
he
thar
s
no
devil
if
it
ain
t
the
colonel
polly
ann
told
me
not
to
let
em
scar
me
and
quite
right
tom
colonel
clark
answered
smiling
he
turned
to
the
judges
if
your
honors
please
said
he
this
gentleman
is
an
old
soldier
of
mine
and
unused
to
the
ways
of
court
i
beg
your
honors
to
excuse
the
judges
smiled
back
and
the
colonel
led
us
out
of
the
building
now
tom
said
he
after
he
had
given
me
a
nod
and
a
kind
word
i
know
this
colfax
and
if
you
will
come
into
the
tavern
this
evening
after
court
we
ll
see
what
can
be
done
i
have
a
case
of
my
own
at
tom
was
very
grateful
he
spent
the
remainder
of
the
daylight
hours
with
other
friends
of
his
shooting
at
a
mark
near
by
serenely
confident
of
the
result
of
his
case
now
that
colonel
clark
had
a
hand
in
it
tom
being
one
of
the
best
shots
in
kentucky
he
had
won
two
beaver
skins
before
the
early
autumn
twilight
fell
as
for
me
i
had
an
afternoon
of
excitement
in
the
court
fascinated
by
the
marvels
of
its
procedures
by
the
impassioned
speeches
of
its
advocates
by
the
gravity
of
its
judges
ambition
stirred
within
me
the
big
room
of
the
tavern
was
filled
with
men
in
heated
talk
over
the
day
s
doings
some
calling
out
for
black
betty
some
for
rum
and
some
demanding
apple
toddies
the
landlord
s
slovenly
negro
came
in
with
candles
their
feeble
rays
reënforcing
the
firelight
and
revealing
the
walls
tom
and
i
had
barely
sat
ourselves
down
at
a
table
in
a
corner
when
in
came
colonel
clark
beside
him
was
a
certain
swarthy
gentleman
whom
i
had
noticed
in
the
court
a
man
of
some
years
with
a
fine
fleshy
face
and
hair
his
expression
was
not
one
to
give
us
the
hope
of
an
amicable
settlement
in
fact
he
had
the
scowl
of
a
thundercloud
he
was
talking
quite
angrily
and
seemed
not
to
heed
those
around
him
why
the
devil
should
i
see
the
man
clark
he
was
saying
the
colonel
did
not
answer
until
they
had
stopped
in
front
of
us
major
colfax
said
he
this
is
sergeant
tom
mcchesney
one
of
the
best
friends
i
have
in
kentucky
i
think
a
vast
deal
of
tom
major
he
was
one
of
the
few
that
never
failed
me
in
the
illinois
campaign
he
is
as
honest
as
the
day
you
will
find
him
if
he
speaks
at
all
and
i
have
great
hopes
that
you
will
agree
tom
the
major
and
i
are
boyhood
friends
and
for
the
sake
of
that
friendship
he
has
consented
to
this
i
fear
that
your
kind
efforts
will
be
useless
colonel
major
colfax
put
in
rather
tartly
mr
mcchesney
not
only
ignores
my
rights
but
was
near
to
hanging
my
what
says
colonel
clark
i
glanced
at
tom
however
helpless
he
might
be
in
a
court
he
could
be
counted
on
to
stand
up
stanchly
in
a
personal
argument
his
retorts
would
certainly
not
be
brilliant
but
they
surely
would
be
dogged
major
colfax
had
begun
wrong
i
reckon
ye
ve
got
no
rights
that
i
know
on
said
tom
i
cleart
the
land
and
settled
it
and
i
have
a
better
right
to
it
nor
any
man
and
i
ve
got
a
grant
fer
a
henderson
grant
cried
the
major
tis
so
much
worthless
i
reckon
it
s
good
enough
fer
me
answered
tom
it
come
from
those
who
blazed
their
way
out
here
and
druv
the
redskins
off
i
don
t
know
nothin
about
this
newfangled
law
but
tis
a
queer
thing
to
my
thinkin
if
them
that
fit
fer
a
place
ain
t
got
the
fust
right
to
major
colfax
turned
to
colonel
clark
with
marked
impatience
i
told
you
it
would
be
useless
clark
said
he
i
care
not
a
fig
for
a
few
paltry
acres
and
as
god
hears
me
i
m
a
reasonable
he
did
not
look
it
then
but
i
swear
by
the
evangels
i
ll
let
no
squatter
have
the
better
of
me
i
did
not
serve
virginia
for
gold
or
land
but
i
lost
my
fortune
in
that
service
and
before
i
know
it
these
backwoodsmen
will
have
every
acre
of
my
grant
it
s
an
old
story
said
colfax
hotly
and
why
the
devil
did
we
fight
england
if
it
wasn
t
that
every
man
should
have
his
rights
by
god
i
ll
not
be
frightened
or
wheedled
out
of
mine
i
sent
an
agent
to
kentucky
to
deal
politely
and
reasonably
with
these
gentry
what
did
they
do
to
him
some
of
them
threw
him
out
neck
and
crop
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
said
major
colfax
fixing
a
piercing
eye
upon
tom
if
i
am
not
mistaken
it
was
this
worthy
sergeant
of
yours
who
came
near
to
hanging
him
and
made
the
poor
devil
flee
kentucky
for
his
this
remark
brought
me
near
to
an
untimely
laugh
at
the
remembrance
of
potts
and
this
though
i
was
far
too
sober
over
the
outcome
of
the
conference
colonel
clark
seized
hold
of
a
chair
and
pushed
it
under
major
colfax
sit
down
gentlemen
we
are
not
so
far
apart
said
the
colonel
coolly
the
slovenly
negro
lad
passing
at
that
time
he
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
here
boy
a
bowl
of
toddy
quick
and
mind
you
brew
it
strong
now
tom
said
he
what
is
this
fine
tale
about
a
hanging
twan
t
nothin
said
tom
you
tell
me
you
didn
t
try
to
hang
potts
cried
major
colfax
i
tell
you
nothin
said
tom
and
his
jaw
was
set
more
stubbornly
than
ever
major
colfax
glanced
at
colonel
clark
you
see
he
said
a
little
triumphantly
i
could
hold
my
tongue
no
longer
major
colfax
is
unjust
sir
i
cried
twas
tom
saved
the
man
from
eh
says
colonel
clark
turning
to
me
sharply
so
you
had
a
hand
in
this
davy
i
might
have
guessed
as
who
the
devil
is
this
says
colfax
a
sort
of
ward
of
mine
answers
the
colonel
drummer
boy
financier
strategist
in
my
illinois
campaign
allow
me
to
present
to
you
major
david
ritchie
when
my
men
objected
to
marching
through
water
up
to
their
necks
ritchie
showed
them
god
bless
my
soul
exclaimed
the
major
staring
at
me
from
under
his
black
eyebrows
he
was
but
a
with
an
old
head
on
his
shoulders
said
the
colonel
and
his
banter
made
me
flush
the
negro
boy
arriving
with
the
toddy
colonel
clark
served
out
three
generous
gourdfuls
a
smaller
one
for
me
your
health
my
friends
and
i
drink
to
a
peaceful
you
may
drink
to
the
devil
if
you
like
says
major
colfax
glaring
at
tom
come
davy
said
colonel
clark
when
he
had
taken
half
the
gourd
let
s
have
the
tale
i
ll
warrant
you
re
behind
i
flushed
again
and
began
by
stammering
for
i
had
a
great
fear
that
major
colfax
s
temper
would
fly
into
bits
when
he
heard
it
well
sir
said
i
i
was
grinding
corn
at
the
mill
when
the
man
came
i
thought
him
a
person
and
he
did
not
give
his
business
he
was
just
for
wheedling
me
and
was
this
mcchesney
s
mill
said
he
ay
said
i
thomas
mcchesney
ay
said
i
then
he
was
all
for
praise
of
thomas
mcchesney
where
is
he
said
he
he
is
at
the
far
pasture
said
i
and
may
be
looked
for
any
whereupon
he
sits
down
and
tries
to
worm
out
of
me
the
business
of
the
mill
the
yield
of
the
land
after
that
he
begins
to
talk
about
the
great
people
he
knows
sevier
and
shelby
and
robertson
and
boone
and
the
like
ay
and
his
intimates
the
randolphs
and
the
popes
and
the
colfaxes
in
virginia
twas
then
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
colonel
campbell
of
and
what
deviltry
was
that
demanded
the
colonel
as
he
dipped
himself
more
of
the
toddy
i
ll
come
to
it
sir
yes
colonel
campbell
was
his
intimate
and
ranted
if
he
did
not
tarry
a
week
with
him
at
abingdon
on
his
journeys
after
that
he
follows
me
to
the
cabin
and
sees
polly
ann
and
tom
and
the
children
on
the
floor
poking
a
possum
ah
says
he
in
his
softest
voice
a
pleasant
family
scene
and
this
is
mcchesney
i
m
your
man
says
tom
then
he
praised
the
mill
site
and
the
land
all
over
again
tis
good
enough
for
a
farmer
says
tom
who
holds
under
henderson
s
grant
i
cried
twas
that
you
wished
to
say
an
hour
ago
and
i
saw
i
had
caught
him
by
the
eternal
cried
colonel
clark
bringing
down
his
fist
upon
the
table
and
what
then
i
glanced
at
major
colfax
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
make
nothing
of
his
look
and
what
did
your
man
say
said
colonel
clark
he
called
on
the
devil
to
bite
me
sir
i
answered
the
colonel
put
down
his
gourd
and
began
to
laugh
the
major
was
looking
at
me
fixedly
and
what
then
said
the
colonel
it
was
then
polly
ann
called
him
a
thief
to
take
away
the
land
tom
had
fought
for
and
paid
for
and
tilled
the
man
was
all
politeness
once
more
said
that
the
matter
was
unfortunate
and
that
a
new
and
good
title
might
be
had
for
a
few
he
said
that
interrupted
major
colfax
half
rising
in
his
chair
he
was
a
damned
so
i
thought
sir
i
answered
the
devil
you
did
said
the
major
tut
colfax
said
the
colonel
pulling
him
by
the
sleeve
of
his
greatcoat
sit
down
and
let
the
lad
finish
and
then
mr
boone
had
told
me
of
a
land
agent
who
had
made
off
with
colonel
campbell
s
silver
spoons
from
abingdon
and
how
the
colonel
had
ridden
east
and
west
after
him
for
a
week
with
a
rope
hanging
on
his
saddle
i
began
to
tell
this
story
and
instead
of
the
description
of
boone
s
man
i
put
in
that
of
potts
in
height
some
five
feet
nine
spare
of
sallow
complexion
and
a
green
major
colfax
leaped
up
in
his
chair
great
jehovah
he
shouted
you
described
the
wrong
colonel
clark
roared
with
laughter
thereby
spilling
some
of
his
toddy
i
ll
warrant
he
did
so
he
cried
and
i
ll
warrant
your
agent
went
white
as
birch
bark
go
on
there
s
not
a
great
deal
more
sir
i
answered
looking
apprehensively
at
major
colfax
who
still
stood
the
man
vowed
i
lied
but
tom
laid
hold
of
him
and
was
for
hurrying
him
off
to
harrodstown
at
which
would
ill
have
suited
your
purpose
put
in
the
colonel
and
what
did
you
do
with
him
we
put
him
in
a
loft
sir
and
then
i
told
tom
that
he
was
not
campbell
s
thief
at
all
but
i
had
a
craving
to
scare
the
man
out
of
kentucky
so
i
rode
off
to
the
neighbors
and
gave
them
the
tale
and
bade
them
come
after
nightfall
as
though
to
hang
campbell
s
thief
which
they
did
and
they
were
near
to
smashing
the
door
trying
to
get
in
the
cabin
tom
told
them
the
rascal
had
escaped
but
they
must
needs
come
in
and
have
jigs
and
toddies
until
midnight
when
they
were
gone
and
we
called
down
the
man
from
the
loft
he
was
in
such
a
state
that
he
could
scarce
find
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
with
his
feet
he
rode
away
into
the
night
and
that
was
the
last
we
heard
of
him
tom
was
not
to
blame
colonel
clark
was
speechless
and
when
for
the
moment
he
would
conquer
his
mirth
a
glance
at
major
colfax
would
set
him
off
again
in
laughter
i
was
puzzled
i
thought
my
colonel
more
human
than
of
old
how
now
colfax
he
cried
giving
a
poke
to
the
major
s
ribs
you
hold
the
sequel
to
this
the
major
s
face
was
purple
with
what
emotion
i
could
not
say
suddenly
he
swung
full
at
me
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
were
the
general
of
this
hoax
you
he
demanded
in
a
strange
voice
the
thing
seemed
an
injustice
to
me
sir
i
replied
in
and
the
man
a
a
rascal
cried
the
major
a
knave
a
poltroon
a
simpleton
and
he
came
to
me
with
no
tale
of
having
been
outwitted
by
a
whereupon
major
colfax
began
to
shake
gently
at
first
and
presently
he
was
in
such
a
gale
of
laughter
that
i
looked
on
him
in
amazement
colonel
clark
joining
in
again
the
major
s
eye
rested
at
length
upon
tom
and
gradually
he
grew
calm
mcchesney
said
he
we
ll
have
no
bickerings
in
court
among
soldiers
the
land
is
yours
and
my
attorney
shall
give
you
a
deed
of
it
your
hand
the
stubbornness
vanished
from
tom
s
face
and
there
came
instead
a
dazed
expression
as
he
thrust
a
great
hard
hand
into
the
major
s
twan
t
the
land
sir
he
stammered
these
varmints
of
settlers
is
gittin
thick
as
flies
in
july
twas
polly
ann
i
reckon
i
m
obleeged
to
ye
there
there
said
the
major
i
thank
the
lord
i
came
to
kentucky
to
see
for
myself
damn
the
land
i
have
plenty
more
and
little
he
turned
quizzically
to
colonel
clark
revealing
a
line
of
strong
white
teeth
suppose
we
drink
a
health
to
your
drummer
boy
said
he
lifting
up
his
gourd
chapter
iv
i
cross
the
mountains
once
more
tis
what
ye
ve
a
right
to
davy
said
polly
ann
and
she
handed
me
a
little
buckskin
bag
on
which
she
had
been
sewing
i
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
and
poured
out
chinking
on
the
table
such
a
motley
collection
of
coins
as
was
never
seen
spanish
milled
dollars
english
sovereigns
and
crowns
and
shillings
paper
issues
of
the
confederacy
and
i
know
not
what
else
tom
looked
on
with
a
grin
while
little
tom
and
peggy
reached
out
their
hands
in
delight
their
mother
vigorously
blocking
their
intentions
ye
ve
earned
it
yerself
said
polly
ann
forestalling
my
protest
tis
what
ye
got
by
the
mill
and
i
ve
laid
it
by
bit
by
bit
for
yer
and
what
do
you
get
i
cried
striving
by
feigned
anger
to
keep
the
tears
back
from
my
eyes
have
you
no
family
to
support
faith
she
answered
we
have
the
mill
that
ye
gave
us
and
the
farm
and
tom
s
rifle
i
reckon
we
ll
fare
better
than
ye
think
tho
we
ll
miss
ye
sore
about
the
i
picked
out
two
sovereigns
from
the
heap
dropped
them
in
the
bag
and
thrust
it
into
my
hunting
shirt
there
said
i
my
voice
having
no
great
steadiness
not
a
penny
more
i
ll
keep
the
bag
for
your
sake
polly
ann
and
i
ll
take
the
mare
for
tom
she
had
had
a
song
on
her
lips
ever
since
our
coming
back
from
danville
seven
days
agone
a
song
on
her
lips
and
banter
on
her
tongue
as
she
made
me
a
new
hunting
shirt
and
breeches
for
the
journey
across
the
mountains
and
now
with
a
sudden
movement
she
burst
into
tears
and
flung
her
arms
about
my
neck
oh
davy
tis
no
time
to
be
stubborn
she
sobbed
and
eddication
is
a
costly
thing
ever
sence
i
found
ye
on
the
trace
years
ago
i
ve
thought
of
ye
one
day
as
a
great
man
and
when
ye
come
back
to
us
so
big
and
l
arned
i
d
wish
to
be
saying
with
pride
that
i
helped
and
who
else
polly
ann
i
faltered
my
heart
racked
with
the
parting
you
found
me
a
homeless
waif
and
you
gave
me
a
home
and
a
father
and
davy
ye
ll
not
forget
us
when
ye
re
great
i
know
ye
ll
not
tis
not
in
she
stood
back
and
smiled
at
me
through
her
tears
the
light
of
heaven
was
in
that
smile
and
i
have
dreamed
of
it
even
since
age
has
crept
upon
me
truly
god
sets
his
own
mark
on
the
pure
in
heart
on
the
unselfish
i
glanced
for
the
last
time
around
the
rude
cabin
every
timber
of
which
was
dedicated
to
our
sacrifices
and
our
love
the
fireplace
with
its
rough
stones
on
the
pegs
the
quaint
butternut
garments
which
polly
ann
had
stitched
the
baby
in
his
bark
cradle
the
rough
bedstead
and
the
little
trundle
pushed
under
it
and
the
very
homely
odor
of
the
place
is
dear
to
me
yet
despite
the
rigors
and
the
dangers
of
my
life
here
should
i
ever
again
find
such
happiness
and
peace
in
the
world
the
children
clung
to
my
knees
and
with
a
god
bless
ye
davy
and
come
back
to
us
tom
squeezed
my
hand
until
i
winced
with
pain
i
leaped
on
the
mare
and
with
blinded
eyes
rode
down
the
familiar
trail
past
the
mill
to
harrodsburg
there
neville
colfax
was
waiting
to
take
me
across
the
mountains
there
is
a
story
in
every
man
s
life
like
the
kernel
in
the
shell
of
a
hickory
nut
i
am
ill
acquainted
with
the
arts
of
a
biographer
but
i
seek
to
give
in
these
pages
little
of
the
shell
and
the
whole
of
the
kernel
of
mine
twould
be
unwise
and
tiresome
to
recount
the
journey
over
the
bare
mountains
with
my
new
friend
and
benefactor
he
was
a
strange
gentleman
now
jolly
enough
to
make
me
shake
with
laughter
and
forget
the
sorrow
of
my
parting
now
moody
for
a
night
and
a
day
now
he
was
all
sweetness
now
all
fire
now
he
was
abstemious
now
and
prodigal
he
had
a
will
like
flint
and
under
it
a
soft
heart
cross
his
moods
and
he
hated
you
i
never
thought
to
cross
them
therefore
he
called
me
davy
and
his
friendliness
grew
with
our
journey
his
anger
turned
against
rocks
and
rivers
landlords
and
emigrants
but
never
against
me
and
for
this
i
was
silently
thankful
and
how
had
he
come
to
take
me
over
the
mountains
and
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
studying
law
mindful
of
the
kernel
of
my
story
i
have
shortened
the
chapter
to
tell
you
out
of
the
proper
place
major
colfax
had
made
tom
and
me
sup
with
himself
and
colonel
clark
at
the
inn
in
danville
and
so
pleased
had
the
major
professed
himself
with
my
story
of
having
outwitted
his
agent
that
he
must
needs
have
more
of
my
adventures
colonel
clark
gave
him
some
and
tom
his
tongue
loosed
by
the
toddy
others
and
the
colonel
added
to
the
debt
i
owed
him
by
suggesting
that
major
colfax
take
me
to
virginia
and
recommend
me
to
a
lawyer
there
nay
cried
the
major
i
will
do
more
i
like
the
lad
for
he
is
modest
despite
the
way
you
have
paraded
him
i
have
an
uncle
in
richmond
judge
wentworth
to
whom
i
will
take
him
in
person
and
when
the
judge
has
done
with
him
if
he
is
not
flayed
and
tattooed
with
blackstone
you
may
flay
and
tattoo
thus
did
i
break
through
my
environment
and
it
was
settled
that
i
should
meet
the
major
in
seven
days
at
harrodstown
once
in
the
journey
did
the
major
make
mention
of
a
subject
which
had
troubled
me
davy
said
he
clark
has
changed
he
is
not
the
same
man
he
was
when
i
saw
him
in
williamsburg
demanding
supplies
for
his
virginia
has
used
him
shamefully
sir
i
answered
and
suddenly
there
came
flooding
to
my
mind
things
i
had
heard
the
colonel
say
in
the
campaign
commonwealths
have
short
memories
said
the
major
they
will
accept
any
sacrifice
with
a
smile
shakespeare
i
believe
speaks
of
royal
ingratitude
he
knew
not
commonwealths
clark
was
once
not
given
to
levity
and
to
toddy
there
there
he
is
my
friend
as
well
as
yours
and
i
will
prove
it
by
pushing
his
cause
in
virginia
is
yours
scotch
anger
then
the
devil
fend
me
from
it
a
monarch
would
have
given
him
fifty
thousand
acres
on
the
wabash
a
palace
and
a
sufficient
annuity
virginia
has
given
him
a
sword
eight
thousand
wild
acres
to
be
sure
repudiated
the
debts
of
his
army
and
left
him
to
starve
is
there
no
room
for
a
genius
in
our
infant
military
establishment
at
length
as
christmas
drew
near
we
came
to
major
colfax
s
seat
some
forty
miles
out
of
the
town
of
richmond
it
was
called
neville
s
grange
the
major
s
grandfather
having
so
named
it
when
he
came
out
from
england
some
sixty
years
before
it
was
a
huge
rambling
draughty
house
of
wood
mortgaged
so
the
major
cheerfully
informed
me
thanks
to
the
patriotism
of
the
family
at
neville
s
grange
the
major
kept
a
somewhat
roisterous
bachelor
s
hall
the
place
was
overrun
with
negroes
and
dogs
and
scarce
a
night
went
by
that
there
was
not
merrymaking
in
the
house
with
the
neighbors
the
time
passed
pleasantly
enough
until
one
frosty
january
morning
major
colfax
had
a
twinge
of
remembrance
cried
out
for
horses
took
me
into
richmond
and
presented
me
to
that
very
learned
and
decorous
gentleman
judge
wentworth
my
studies
began
within
the
hour
of
my
arrival
chapter
i
meet
an
old
bedfellow
i
shall
burden
no
one
with
the
dry
chronicles
of
a
law
office
the
acquirement
of
learning
is
a
slow
process
in
life
and
perchance
a
slower
one
in
the
telling
i
lacked
not
application
during
the
three
years
of
my
stay
in
richmond
and
to
earn
my
living
i
worked
at
such
odd
tasks
as
came
my
way
the
judge
resembled
major
colfax
in
but
one
trait
he
was
choleric
but
he
was
painstaking
and
cautious
and
i
soon
found
out
that
he
looked
askance
upon
any
one
whom
his
nephew
might
recommend
he
liked
the
major
but
he
vowed
him
to
be
a
roisterer
and
spendthrift
and
one
day
some
months
after
my
advent
the
judge
asked
me
flatly
how
i
came
to
fall
in
with
major
colfax
i
told
him
at
the
end
of
this
conversation
he
took
my
breath
away
by
bidding
me
come
to
live
with
him
like
many
lawyers
of
that
time
he
had
a
little
house
in
one
corner
of
his
grounds
for
his
office
it
stood
under
great
spreading
trees
and
there
i
was
wont
to
sit
through
many
a
summer
day
wrestling
with
the
authorities
in
the
evenings
we
would
have
political
arguments
for
the
confederacy
was
in
a
seething
state
between
the
federalists
and
the
republicans
over
the
new
constitution
now
ratified
between
the
federalists
and
the
jacobins
i
would
better
say
for
the
virulence
of
the
french
revolution
was
soon
to
be
reflected
among
the
parties
on
our
side
kentucky
swelled
into
an
unmanageable
territory
was
come
near
to
rebellion
because
the
government
was
not
strong
enough
to
wrest
from
spain
the
free
navigation
of
the
mississippi
and
yet
i
yearned
to
go
back
and
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
time
when
i
should
have
stored
enough
in
my
head
to
gain
admission
to
the
bar
i
was
therefore
greatly
embarrassed
when
my
examinations
came
by
an
offer
from
judge
wentworth
to
stay
in
richmond
and
help
him
with
his
practice
it
was
an
offer
not
to
be
lightly
set
aside
and
yet
i
had
made
up
my
mind
he
flew
into
a
passion
because
of
my
desire
to
return
to
a
wild
country
of
outlaws
and
vagabonds
why
damme
he
cried
kentucky
and
this
pretty
state
of
franklin
which
desired
to
chip
off
from
north
carolina
are
traitorous
places
disloyal
to
congress
intriguing
with
a
spanish
minister
and
the
spanish
governor
of
louisiana
to
secede
from
their
own
people
and
join
the
king
of
spain
bah
he
exclaimed
if
our
new
federal
constitution
is
adopted
i
would
hang
jack
sevier
of
franklin
and
your
kentuckian
wilkinson
to
the
highest
trees
west
of
the
i
can
see
the
little
gentleman
as
he
spoke
his
black
broadcloth
coat
and
lace
ruffles
his
hand
clutching
the
gold
head
of
his
cane
his
face
screwed
up
with
indignation
under
his
white
wig
it
was
on
a
sunday
and
he
was
standing
by
the
lilac
bushes
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
his
square
brick
house
david
said
he
more
calmly
i
trust
i
have
taught
you
something
besides
the
law
i
trust
i
have
taught
you
that
a
strong
federal
government
alone
will
be
the
salvation
of
our
you
can
not
blame
kentucky
greatly
sir
said
i
feeling
that
i
must
stand
up
for
my
friends
the
federal
government
has
done
little
enough
for
its
people
and
treated
them
to
a
deal
of
neglect
they
won
that
western
country
for
themselves
with
no
federal
nor
virginia
or
north
carolina
troops
to
help
them
no
man
east
of
the
mountains
knows
what
that
fight
has
been
no
man
east
of
the
mountains
knows
the
horror
of
that
indian
warfare
this
government
gives
them
no
protection
now
nay
congress
can
not
even
procure
for
them
an
outlet
for
their
commerce
they
must
trade
or
perish
spain
closes
the
mississippi
arrests
our
merchants
seizes
their
goods
and
often
throws
them
into
prison
no
wonder
they
scorn
the
congress
as
weak
and
the
judge
stared
at
me
aghast
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
dared
oppose
him
on
this
subject
what
he
sputtered
what
you
are
a
separatist
you
whom
i
have
received
into
the
bosom
of
my
family
seizing
the
cane
at
the
middle
he
brandished
it
in
my
face
don
t
misunderstand
me
sir
said
i
you
have
given
me
books
to
read
and
have
taught
me
what
may
be
the
destiny
of
our
nation
on
this
continent
but
you
must
forgive
a
people
whose
lives
have
been
spent
in
a
fierce
struggle
for
their
homes
whose
families
have
nearly
all
lost
some
member
by
massacre
who
are
separated
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
wilderness
from
he
looked
at
me
speechless
and
turned
and
walked
into
the
house
i
thought
i
had
sinned
past
forgiveness
and
i
was
beyond
description
uncomfortable
for
he
had
been
like
a
parent
to
me
but
the
next
morning
at
half
after
seven
he
walked
into
the
little
office
and
laid
down
some
gold
pieces
on
my
table
gold
was
very
scarce
in
those
days
they
are
for
your
journey
david
said
he
my
only
comfort
in
your
going
back
is
that
you
may
grow
up
to
put
some
temperance
into
their
wild
heads
i
have
a
commission
for
you
at
jonesboro
in
what
was
once
the
unspeakable
state
of
franklin
you
can
stop
there
on
your
way
to
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
great
bulky
letter
addressed
to
thomas
wright
esquire
in
jonesboro
north
for
the
good
gentleman
could
not
bring
himself
to
write
franklin
it
was
late
in
september
of
the
year
when
i
set
out
on
my
homeward
way
for
kentucky
was
home
to
me
i
was
going
back
to
polly
ann
and
tom
and
visions
of
that
rose
before
my
eyes
as
i
rode
in
a
packet
in
my
were
some
dozen
letters
which
wrenn
the
schoolmaster
at
harrodstown
had
writ
at
polly
ann
s
bidding
i
have
the
letters
yet
for
wrenn
was
plainly
an
artist
and
had
set
down
on
the
paper
the
words
just
as
they
had
flowed
from
her
heart
ay
and
there
was
news
in
the
letters
though
not
surprising
news
among
those
pioneer
families
whom
god
blessed
so
abundantly
since
david
ritchie
mcchesney
i
mention
the
name
with
pride
had
risen
above
the
necessities
of
a
bark
cradle
two
more
had
succeeded
him
a
brother
and
a
sister
i
spurred
my
horse
onward
and
thought
impatiently
of
the
weary
leagues
between
my
family
and
me
i
have
often
pictured
myself
on
that
journey
i
was
years
of
age
though
one
would
have
called
me
older
my
looks
were
nothing
to
boast
of
and
i
was
grown
up
tall
and
weedy
so
that
i
must
have
made
quite
a
comical
sight
with
my
long
legs
dangling
on
either
side
of
the
pony
i
wore
a
suit
of
gray
homespun
and
in
my
i
carried
four
precious
law
books
the
stock
in
trade
which
my
generous
patron
had
given
me
but
as
i
mounted
the
slopes
of
the
mountains
my
spirits
rose
too
at
the
prospect
of
the
life
before
me
the
woods
were
all
aflame
with
color
with
wine
and
amber
and
gold
and
the
hills
wore
the
misty
mantle
of
shadowy
blue
so
dear
to
my
youthful
memory
as
i
left
the
rude
taverns
of
a
morning
and
jogged
along
the
heights
i
watched
the
vapors
rise
and
roll
away
from
the
valleys
far
beneath
and
saw
great
flocks
of
ducks
and
swans
and
cackling
geese
darkening
the
air
in
their
southward
flight
strange
that
i
fell
in
with
no
company
for
the
trail
leading
into
the
tennessee
country
was
widened
and
broadened
beyond
belief
and
everywhere
i
came
upon
blackened
fires
and
abandoned
and
refuse
bones
gnawed
by
the
wolves
and
bleached
by
the
weather
i
slept
in
some
of
these
with
my
fire
going
brightly
indifferent
to
the
howl
of
wolves
in
chase
or
the
scream
of
a
panther
pouncing
on
its
prey
for
i
was
born
of
the
wilderness
it
had
no
terrors
for
me
nor
did
i
ever
feel
alone
the
great
cliffs
with
their
clinging
gnarled
trees
the
vast
mountains
clothed
in
the
motley
colors
of
the
autumn
the
sweet
and
smoky
smell
of
the
indian
summer
all
were
dear
to
me
as
i
drew
near
to
jonesboro
my
thoughts
began
to
dwell
upon
that
strange
and
fascinating
man
who
had
entertained
polly
ann
and
tom
and
me
so
lavishly
on
our
way
to
kentucky
captain
john
sevier
for
he
had
made
a
great
noise
in
the
world
since
then
and
the
wrath
of
such
men
as
my
late
patron
was
heavy
upon
him
yes
john
sevier
nollichucky
jack
had
been
a
king
in
all
but
name
since
i
had
seen
him
the
head
of
such
a
principality
as
stirred
the
blood
to
read
about
it
comprised
the
watauga
settlement
among
the
mountains
of
what
is
now
tennessee
and
was
called
prosaically
as
is
the
wont
of
the
the
free
state
of
franklin
there
were
certain
conservative
and
unimaginative
souls
in
this
mountain
principality
who
for
various
reasons
held
their
old
allegiance
to
the
state
of
north
carolina
one
colonel
tipton
led
these
loyalist
forces
and
armed
partisans
of
either
side
had
for
some
years
ridden
up
and
down
the
length
of
the
land
burning
and
pillaging
and
slaying
we
in
virginia
had
heard
of
two
sets
of
courts
in
franklin
of
two
sets
of
legislators
but
of
late
the
rumor
had
grown
persistently
that
nollichucky
jack
was
now
a
kind
of
fugitive
and
that
he
had
passed
the
summer
pleasantly
enough
fighting
indians
in
the
vicinity
of
cave
it
was
court
day
as
i
rode
into
the
little
town
of
jonesboro
the
air
sparkling
like
a
blue
diamond
over
the
mountain
crests
and
i
drew
deep
into
my
lungs
once
more
the
scent
of
the
frontier
life
i
had
loved
so
well
in
the
streets
currents
of
excited
men
flowed
and
backed
and
eddied
backwoodsmen
and
farmers
in
the
familiar
hunting
shirts
of
hide
or
homespun
and
lawyers
in
dress
less
rude
a
line
of
horses
stood
kicking
and
switching
their
tails
in
front
of
the
log
tavern
rough
carts
and
wagons
had
been
left
here
and
there
with
their
poles
on
the
ground
and
between
these
piles
of
skins
were
heaped
up
and
bags
of
corn
and
grain
the
log
was
deserted
but
the
was
the
centre
of
such
a
swirling
crowd
as
i
had
often
seen
at
harrodstown
now
there
are
brawls
and
brawls
and
i
should
have
thought
with
shame
of
my
kentucky
had
i
not
perceived
that
this
was
no
ordinary
court
day
and
that
an
unusual
excitement
was
in
the
wind
tying
my
horse
and
making
my
way
through
the
press
in
front
of
the
tavern
door
i
entered
the
common
room
and
found
it
stifling
brawling
and
drinking
going
on
apace
scarce
had
i
found
a
seat
before
the
whole
room
was
emptied
by
one
consent
all
crowding
out
of
the
door
after
two
men
who
began
a
fight
in
the
street
i
had
seen
fights
in
kentucky
and
if
i
have
forborne
to
speak
of
them
it
is
because
there
always
has
been
within
me
a
loathing
for
them
and
so
i
sat
quietly
in
the
common
room
until
the
landlord
came
i
asked
him
if
he
could
direct
me
to
wright
s
house
as
i
had
a
letter
for
that
gentleman
his
answer
was
to
grin
at
me
incredulously

some
of

nollichucky
cave

and
there

one
young
lad
that

like
he

a
gentleman

i

like
to

into
a
fight
with

he

fight
never

sech
a
day
in
i
likewise
ran
to
the
door
and
this
fight
interested
me
there
was
a
great
in
the
midst
of
a
circle
pouring
out
a
torrent
of
abuse
at
a
tall
young
man
that
thar
s
hump
gibson
said
the
landlord
genially
pointing
out
the
ruffian
and
the
young

washington
county
won
t
budge
me
a
you
ll
pay
bill
wilder
or
go
to
jail
by
the
eternal
cried
the
young
man
quite
as
angrily
whereupon
i
looked
upon
him
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
commiseration
with
a
gulping
certainty
in
my
throat
that
i
was
about
to
see
murder
done
he
was
a
strange
young
man
with
the
rare
marked
look
that
would
compel
even
a
poor
memory
to
pick
him
out
again
for
example
he
was
very
tall
and
very
slim
with
red
hair
blown
every
which
way
over
a
high
and
towering
forehead
that
seemed
as
long
as
the
face
under
it
the
face
too
was
long
and
all
freckled
by
the
weather
the
blue
eyes
held
me
in
wonder
and
these
blazed
with
such
prodigious
wrath
that
if
a
look
could
have
killed
hump
gibson
would
have
been
stricken
on
the
spot
gibson
was
however
very
much
alive
skin
out
o
here
afore
i
kill
ye
he
shouted
and
he
charged
at
the
slim
young
man
like
a
buffalo
while
the
crowd
held
its
breath
i
who
had
looked
upon
cruel
sights
in
my
day
was
turning
away
with
a
kind
of
sickening
when
i
saw
the
slim
young
man
dodge
the
rush
he
did
more
with
two
strides
of
his
long
legs
he
reached
the
fence
ripped
off
the
topmost
rail
and
his
huge
antagonist
having
changed
his
direction
and
coming
at
him
with
a
bellow
was
met
with
the
point
of
a
scantling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
and
gibson
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
it
had
all
happened
in
a
twinkling
and
there
was
a
moment
s
lull
while
the
minds
of
the
onlookers
needed
readjustment
and
then
they
gave
vent
to
ecstasies
of
delight
great
goliah
cried
the
landlord
breathlessly
he
shet
him
up
jest
like
a
i
looked
at
the
tall
young
man
and
he
was
the
very
essence
of
wrath
unmindful
of
the
plaudits
he
stood
brandishing
the
over
the
great
writhing
figure
on
the
ground
and
he
was
slobbering
i
recall
that
this
fact
gave
a
twinge
to
something
in
my
memory
come
on
hump
gibson
he
cried
come
on
at
which
the
crowd
went
wild
with
pure
joy
witticisms
flew
thought
ye
was
goin
to
eat
im
up
hump
said
a
friend
ye
ain
t
hed
yer
meal
yet
hump
reminded
another
hump
gibson
arose
slowly
out
of
the
dust
yet
he
did
not
stand
straight
come
on
come
on
cried
the
young
and
he
thrust
the
point
of
the
rail
within
a
foot
of
gibson
s
stomach
come
on
hump
howled
the
crowd
but
gibson
stood
irresolute
he
lacked
the
supreme
test
of
courage
which
was
demanded
on
this
occasion
then
he
turned
and
walked
away
very
slowly
as
though
his
pace
might
mitigate
in
some
degree
the
shame
of
his
retreat
the
young
man
flung
away
the
and
thrusting
aside
the
overzealous
among
his
admirers
he
strode
past
me
into
the
tavern
his
anger
still
hot
hooray
fer
jackson
they
shouted
hooray
fer
andy
jackson
andy
jackson
then
i
knew
then
i
remembered
a
slim
wild
boy
digging
his
toes
in
the
red
mud
long
ago
at
the
waxhaws
settlement

by
interfering
with

cried
jackson
come
outside

landlord

and
the
men
in

around

into
him
andy
cried
one
don
t
let

stranger
said
another
jackson
turned
on
this
man
with
such
truculence
that
he
edged
away
to
the
rear
of
the
room
step
out
sir
said
jackson
starting
for
the
door
before
i
could
reply
i
followed
perforce
not
without
misgivings
the
crowd
pushing
eagerly
after
before
we
reached
the
dusty
street
jackson
began
pulling
off
his
coat
in
a
trice
the
shouting
onlookers
had
made
a
ring
and
we
stood
facing
each
other
he
in
his
we
ll
fight
fair
said
he
his
lips
wetting
very
good
said
i
if
you
are
still
accustomed
to
this
hasty
manner
you
have
not
asked
my
name
my
standing
nor
my
reasons
for
wanting
i
know
not
whether
it
was
what
i
said
that
made
him
stare
or
how
i
said
it
pistols
if
you
like
said
he
no
said
i
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
find
temple
i
fought
you
this
way
once
and
it
s
you
fought
me
this
way
once
he
repeated
the
noise
of
the
crowd
was
hushed
and
they
drew
nearer
to
hear
come
jackson
said
i
you
are
a
lawyer
and
a
gentleman
and
so
am
i
do
not
care
to
be
beaten
to
a
pulp
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
and
i
am
in
a
hurry
if
you
will
step
back
into
the
tavern
i
will
explain
to
you
my
reasons
for
wishing
to
get
to
jackson
stared
at
me
the
more
by
the
eternal
said
he
you
are
a
cool
man
give
me
my
coat
he
shouted
to
the
bystanders
and
they
helped
him
on
with
it
now
said
he
as
they
made
to
follow
him
keep
back
i
would
talk
to
this
gentleman
by
the
heavens
he
cried
when
he
had
gained
the
room
i
believe
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
i
saw
it
in
your
then
i
laughed
mr
jackson
said
i
doubtless
you
do
not
remember
a
homeless
boy
named
david
whom
you
took
to
your
uncle
s
house
in
the
waxhaws
i
do
he
exclaimed
as
i
live
i
do
why
we
slept
and
you
stumped
your
toe
getting
into
bed
and
swore
said
i
at
that
he
laughed
so
heartily
that
the
landlord
came
running
across
the
room
and
we
fought
together
at
the
old
fields
school
are
you
that
boy
and
he
scanned
me
again
by
god
i
believe
you
suddenly
his
face
clouded
once
more
but
what
about
temple
said
he
ah
i
answered
i
come
to
that
quickly
temple
is
my
cousin
after
i
left
your
uncle
s
house
my
father
took
me
to
is
he
a
charlestown
temple
demanded
jackson
for
i
spent
some
time
gambling
and
with
the
gentry
there
and
i
know
many
of
them
i
was
a
wild
lad
i
repeat
his
exact
words
and
i
ran
up
a
bill
in
charlestown
that
would
have
filled
a
folio
volume
faith
all
i
had
left
me
was
the
clothes
on
my
back
and
a
good
horse
i
made
up
my
mind
one
night
that
if
i
could
pay
my
debts
and
get
out
of
charlestown
i
would
go
into
the
back
country
and
study
law
and
sober
down
there
was
a
braiden
in
the
ordinary
who
staked
me
two
hundred
dollars
at
against
my
horse
gad
sir
that
was
providence
i
won
i
left
charlestown
with
honor
i
studied
law
at
salisbury
in
north
carolina
and
i
have
come
here
to
practise
you
seem
to
have
the
talent
said
i
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
the
hump
gibson
incident
that
is
my
history
in
a
nutshell
said
jackson
and
now
he
added
since
you
are
temple
s
cousin
and
friend
and
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
to
boot
i
will
tell
you
where
i
think
he
where
is
that
i
asked
eagerly
i
ll
stake
a
cowbell
that
sevier
will
stop
at
the
widow
brown
s
he
replied
i
ll
put
you
on
the
road
but
mind
you
you
are
to
tell
temple
that
he
is
to
come
back
here
and
race
me
at
greasy
i
ll
warrant
him
to
come
said
whereupon
we
left
the
inn
together
more
amicably
than
before
jackson
had
a
thoroughbred
horse
near
by
that
was
a
pleasure
to
see
and
my
admiration
of
his
mount
seemed
to
set
me
as
firmly
in
jackson
s
esteem
again
as
that
gentleman
himself
sat
in
the
saddle
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
rode
out
with
me
some
distance
on
the
road
and
reminded
me
at
the
last
that
nick
was
to
race
him
chapter
vi
the
widow
brown
s
it
was
not
to
my
credit
that
i
should
have
lost
the
trail
after
jackson
put
me
straight
but
the
night
was
dark
the
country
unknown
to
me
and
heavily
wooded
and
mountainous
in
addition
to
these
things
my
mind
ran
like
fire
my
thoughts
sometimes
flew
back
to
the
wondrous
summer
evening
when
i
trod
the
nollichucky
trace
with
tom
and
polly
ann
when
i
first
looked
down
upon
the
log
palace
of
that
prince
of
the
border
john
sevier
well
i
remembered
him
handsome
gay
a
courtier
in
buckskin
small
wonder
he
was
idolized
by
the
watauga
settlers
that
he
had
been
their
leader
in
the
struggle
of
franklin
for
liberty
and
small
wonder
that
nick
temple
should
be
in
his
following
nick
my
mind
was
in
a
torment
concerning
him
what
of
his
mother
should
i
speak
of
having
seen
her
i
went
blindly
through
the
woods
for
hours
after
the
night
fell
my
horse
stumbling
and
weary
until
at
length
i
came
to
a
lonely
clearing
on
the
mountain
side
and
a
fierce
pack
of
dogs
dashed
barking
at
my
horse
s
heels
there
was
a
dark
cabin
ahead
indistinct
in
the
starlight
and
there
i
knocked
until
a
gruff
voice
answered
me
and
a
tousled
man
came
to
the
door
yes
i
had
missed
the
trail
he
shook
his
head
when
i
asked
for
the
widow
brown
s
and
bade
me
share
his
bed
for
the
night
no
i
would
go
on
i
was
used
to
the
backwoods
thereupon
he
thawed
a
little
kicked
the
dogs
and
pointed
to
where
the
mountain
dipped
against
the
sky
there
was
a
trail
there
which
led
direct
to
the
widow
brown
s
if
i
could
follow
it
so
i
left
him
once
the
fear
had
settled
deeply
of
missing
nick
at
the
widow
brown
s
i
put
my
mind
on
my
journey
and
thanks
to
my
early
training
i
was
able
to
keep
the
trail
it
doubled
around
the
spurs
forded
stony
brooks
in
diagonals
and
often
in
the
darkness
of
the
mountain
forest
i
had
to
feel
for
the
blazes
on
the
trees
there
was
no
making
time
i
gained
the
notch
with
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
started
on
with
the
descent
crisscrossing
following
a
stream
here
and
a
stream
there
until
at
length
the
song
of
the
higher
waters
ceased
and
i
knew
that
i
was
in
the
valley
suddenly
there
was
no
over
my
head
i
had
gained
the
road
once
more
and
i
followed
it
hopefully
avoiding
the
stumps
and
the
deep
wagon
ruts
where
the
ground
was
spongy
the
morning
light
revealed
a
milky
mist
through
which
the
trees
showed
like
phantoms
then
there
came
stains
upon
the
mist
of
royal
purple
of
scarlet
of
yellow
like
a
mandarin
s
robe
peeps
of
deep
blue
fading
into
azure
as
the
mist
lifted
the
fiery
eye
of
the
sun
was
cocked
over
the
crest
and
beyond
me
i
saw
a
house
with
its
logs
all
golden
brown
in
the
level
rays
the
withered
cornstalks
orange
among
the
blackened
stumps
my
horse
stopped
of
his
own
will
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
a
cock
crew
a
lean
hound
prostrate
on
the
porch
of
the
house
rose
to
his
haunches
sniffed
growled
leaped
down
and
ran
to
the
road
and
sniffed
again
i
listened
startled
and
made
sure
of
the
distant
ring
of
many
hoofs
and
yet
i
stayed
there
irresolute
could
it
be
tipton
and
his
men
riding
from
jonesboro
to
capture
sevier
the
grew
louder
and
then
the
hound
in
the
road
gave
tongue
to
the
short
sharp
bark
that
is
the
call
to
arms
other
dogs
hitherto
unseen
took
up
the
cry
and
turning
in
my
saddle
i
saw
a
body
of
men
riding
hard
at
me
through
the
alley
in
the
forest
at
their
head
on
a
heavy
horse
was
one
who
might
have
stood
for
the
figure
of
turbulence
and
i
made
no
doubt
that
this
was
colonel
tipton
himself
colonel
tipton
once
secessionist
now
champion
of
the
old
north
state
and
of
john
sevier
at
sight
of
me
he
reined
up
so
violently
that
his
horse
went
back
on
his
haunches
and
the
men
behind
were
near
overriding
him
look
out
boys
he
shouted
with
a
fierce
oath
they
ve
got
guards
out
he
flung
back
one
hand
to
his
holster
for
a
pistol
while
the
other
reached
for
the
powder
flask
at
his
belt
he
primed
the
pan
and
seeing
me
immovable
set
his
horse
forward
at
an
amble
his
pistol
at
the
cock
who
in
hell
are
you
he
cried
a
traveller
from
virginia
i
answered
and
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
with
another
oath
i
have
just
this
moment
come
here
said
i
as
calmly
as
i
might
i
lost
the
trail
in
the
he
glared
at
me
purpling
perplexed
is
sevier
there
said
he
pointing
at
the
house
i
don
t
know
said
tipton
turned
to
his
men
who
were
listening
surround
the
house
he
cried
and
watch
this
i
rode
on
perforce
towards
the
house
with
tipton
and
three
others
while
his
men
scattered
over
the
and
cursed
the
dogs
and
then
we
saw
in
the
open
door
the
figure
of
a
woman
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hand
we
pulled
up
five
of
us
before
the
porch
in
front
of
her
good
morning
brown
said
tipton
gruffly
good
morning
colonel
answered
the
widow
tipton
leaped
from
his
horse
flung
the
bridle
to
a
companion
and
put
his
foot
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
to
mount
then
a
strange
thing
happened
the
lady
turned
deftly
seized
a
chair
from
within
and
pulled
it
across
the
threshold
she
sat
herself
down
firmly
an
expression
on
her
face
which
hinted
that
the
late
lamented
brown
had
been
a
dominated
man
colonel
tipton
stopped
staggering
from
the
very
impetus
of
his
charge
and
gazed
at
her
blankly
i
have
come
for
colonel
sevier
he
blurted
and
then
his
anger
rising
i
will
have
no
trifling
ma
am
he
is
in
this
la
you
don
t
tell
me
answered
the
widow
in
a
tone
that
was
wholly
conversational
he
is
in
this
house
shouted
the
colonel
i
reckon
you
ve
guessed
wrong
colonel
said
the
widow
there
was
an
awkward
pause
until
tipton
heard
a
titter
behind
him
then
his
wrath
exploded
i
have
a
warrant
against
the
scoundrel
for
high
treason
he
cried
and
by
god
i
will
search
the
house
and
serve
still
the
widow
sat
tight
the
rock
of
ages
was
neither
more
movable
nor
calmer
than
she
surely
colonel
you
would
not
invade
the
house
of
an
unprotected
the
colonel
evidently
with
a
great
effort
throttled
his
wrath
for
the
moment
his
new
tone
was
apologetic
but
firm
i
regret
to
have
to
do
so
ma
am
said
he
but
both
sexes
are
equal
before
the
the
law
repeated
the
widow
seemingly
tickled
at
the
word
she
smiled
indulgently
at
the
colonel
what
a
pity
tipton
that
the
law
compels
you
to
arrest
such
a
good
friend
of
yours
as
colonel
sevier
what
colonel
tipton
what
nobility
there
was
a
second
titter
behind
him
whereat
he
swung
round
quickly
and
the
crimson
veins
in
his
face
looked
as
if
they
must
burst
he
saw
me
with
my
hand
over
my
mouth
you
warned
him
damn
you
he
shouted
and
turning
again
leaped
to
the
porch
and
tried
to
squeeze
past
the
widow
into
the
house
how
dare
you
sir
she
shrieked
giving
him
a
vigorous
push
backwards
the
four
of
us
his
three
men
and
myself
laughed
outright
tipton
s
rage
leaped
its
bounds
he
returned
to
the
attack
again
and
again
and
yet
at
the
crucial
moment
his
courage
would
fail
him
and
he
would
let
the
widow
thrust
him
back
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
there
were
two
new
spectators
of
this
comedy
i
started
and
looked
again
and
was
near
to
crying
out
at
sight
of
one
of
them
the
others
did
cry
out
but
tipton
paid
no
heed
ten
years
had
made
his
figure
more
portly
but
i
knew
at
once
the
man
in
the
hunting
shirt
with
the
long
hair
flowing
to
his
shoulders
with
the
keen
dark
face
and
courtly
bearing
and
humorous
eyes
yes
humorous
even
now
for
he
stood
smiling
at
this
comedy
played
by
his
enemy
unmindful
of
his
peril
the
widow
saw
him
before
tipton
did
so
intent
was
he
on
the
struggle
enough
she
cried
enough
john
tipton
tipton
drew
back
involuntarily
and
a
smile
broadened
on
the
widow
s
face
shame
on
you
for
doubting
a
lady
s
word
allow
me
to
present
to
you
colonel
tipton
turned
stared
as
a
man
might
who
sees
a
ghost
and
broke
into
such
profanity
as
i
have
seldom
heard
by
the
eternal
god
john
sevier
he
shouted
i
ll
hang
you
to
the
nearest
tree
colonel
sevier
merely
made
a
little
ironical
bow
and
looked
at
the
gentleman
beside
him
i
have
surrendered
to
colonel
love
he
said
tipton
snatched
from
his
belt
the
pistol
which
he
might
have
used
on
me
and
there
flashed
through
my
head
the
thought
that
some
powder
might
yet
be
held
in
its
pan
we
cried
out
all
of
us
his
men
the
widow
and
myself
all
save
sevier
who
stood
quietly
smiling
suddenly
while
we
waited
for
murder
a
tall
figure
shot
out
of
the
door
past
the
widow
the
pistol
flew
out
of
tipton
s
hand
and
tipton
swung
about
with
something
like
a
bellow
to
face
nicholas
temple
well
i
knew
him
and
oddly
enough
at
that
time
riddle
s
words
of
long
ago
came
to
me
god
help
the
woman
you
love
or
the
man
you
how
shall
i
describe
him
he
was
thin
even
to
seeming
frailness
yet
it
was
the
frailness
of
the
the
golden
hair
awry
across
his
forehead
the
face
the
same
thin
and
finely
cut
face
of
the
boy
the
gray
eyes
held
an
anger
that
did
not
blaze
it
was
far
more
dangerous
than
that
colonel
john
tipton
looked
and
as
i
live
he
recoiled
if
you
touch
him
i
ll
kill
you
said
temple
nor
did
he
say
it
angrily
i
marked
for
the
first
time
that
he
held
a
pistol
in
his
slim
fingers
what
tipton
might
have
done
when
he
swung
to
his
new
bearings
is
mere
conjecture
for
colonel
sevier
himself
stepped
up
on
the
porch
laid
his
hand
on
temple
s
arm
and
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
tone
what
he
said
we
didn
t
hear
the
astonishing
thing
was
that
neither
of
them
for
the
moment
paid
any
attention
to
the
infuriated
man
beside
them
i
saw
nick
s
expression
change
he
smiled
the
smile
the
landlord
had
described
the
smile
that
made
men
and
women
willing
to
die
for
him
after
that
colonel
sevier
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
pistol
from
the
floor
of
the
porch
and
handed
it
with
a
bow
to
tipton
butt
first
tipton
took
it
seemingly
without
knowing
why
and
at
that
instant
a
negro
boy
came
around
the
house
leading
a
horse
sevier
mounted
it
without
a
protest
from
any
one
i
am
ready
to
go
with
you
gentlemen
he
said
colonel
tipton
slipped
his
pistol
back
into
his
belt
stepped
down
from
the
porch
and
leaped
into
his
saddle
and
he
and
his
men
rode
off
into
the
alley
in
the
forest
that
was
called
a
road
nick
stood
beside
the
widow
staring
after
them
until
they
had
disappeared
my
horse
boy
he
shouted
to
the
gaping
negro
who
vanished
on
the
errand
what
will
you
do
temple
asked
the
widow
rescue
him
ma
am
cried
nick
beginning
to
pace
up
and
down
i
ll
ride
to
turner
s
cozby
and
evans
are
there
and
before
night
we
shall
have
made
jonesboro
too
hot
to
hold
tipton
and
his
la
temple
said
the
widow
with
unfeigned
admiration
i
never
saw
the
like
of
you
but
i
know
john
tipton
and
he
ll
have
colonel
sevier
started
for
north
carolina
before
our
boys
can
get
to
then
we
ll
follow
says
nick
beginning
to
pace
again
suddenly
at
a
cry
from
the
widow
he
stopped
and
stared
at
me
a
light
in
his
eye
like
a
point
of
steel
his
hand
slipped
to
his
waist
a
spy
he
said
and
turned
and
smiled
at
the
lady
who
was
watching
him
with
a
kind
of
fascination
but
damnably
cool
he
continued
looking
at
me
i
wonder
if
he
thinks
to
outride
me
on
that
beast
look
you
sir
he
cried
as
brown
s
negro
came
back
struggling
with
a
chestnut
that
was
making
half
circles
on
his
hind
legs
i
ll
give
you
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
lay
you
a
against
a
pair
of
moccasins
that
you
never
get
back
to
god
forbid
that
i
ever
do
i
answered
fervently
what
he
exclaimed
and
you
here
with
him
on
this
sneak
s
errand
i
am
here
with
him
on
no
errand
said
i
he
and
his
crew
came
on
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
at
the
edge
of
the
clearing
temple
i
am
here
to
find
you
and
to
save
time
i
will
ride
with
egad
you
ll
have
to
ride
like
the
devil
then
said
he
and
he
stooped
and
snatched
the
widow
s
hand
and
kissed
it
with
a
daring
gallantry
that
i
had
thought
to
find
in
him
he
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
temple
she
said
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
and
may
you
save
our
jack
he
snatched
the
bridle
from
the
boy
and
with
one
leap
he
was
on
the
rearing
wheeling
horse
come
on
he
cried
to
me
and
waving
his
hat
at
the
lady
on
the
porch
he
started
off
with
a
gallop
up
the
trail
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
which
tipton
s
men
had
taken
all
that
i
saw
of
nicholas
temple
on
that
ride
to
turner
s
was
his
back
and
presently
i
lost
sight
of
that
in
truth
i
never
got
to
turner
s
at
all
for
i
met
him
coming
back
at
the
wind
s
pace
a
huge
swarthy
determined
man
at
his
side
and
four
others
spurring
after
the
spume
dripping
from
the
horses
mouths
they
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
me
as
they
passed
and
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
to
do
but
to
turn
my
tired
beast
and
follow
at
any
pace
i
could
make
towards
jonesboro
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
i
reached
the
town
the
town
set
down
among
the
hills
like
a
caldron
boiling
over
with
the
wrath
of
franklin
the
news
of
the
capture
of
their
beloved
sevier
had
flown
through
the
mountains
like
seeds
on
the
autumn
wind
and
from
north
south
east
and
west
the
faithful
were
coming
in
cursing
tipton
and
carolina
as
they
rode
i
tethered
my
tired
beast
at
the
first
picket
and
was
no
sooner
on
my
feet
than
i
was
caught
in
the
hurrying
stream
of
the
crowd
and
fairly
pushed
and
beaten
towards
the
around
it
a
thousand
furious
men
were
packed
i
heard
cheering
hoarse
and
fierce
cries
threats
and
imprecations
and
i
knew
that
they
were
listening
to
oratory
i
was
suddenly
shot
around
the
corner
of
a
house
saw
the
orator
himself
and
gasped
it
was
nicholas
temple
there
was
something
in
the
tall
slim
boyish
figure
that
towered
above
the
crowd
in
the
finely
wrought
passionate
face
in
the
voice
charged
with
such
an
anger
as
is
given
to
few
men
what
has
north
carolina
done
for
franklin
he
cried
protected
her
no
repudiated
her
yes
you
gave
her
to
the
confederacy
for
a
war
debt
and
the
confederacy
flung
her
back
you
shook
yourselves
free
from
carolina
s
tyranny
and
traitors
betrayed
you
again
and
now
they
have
betrayed
your
leader
will
you
avenge
him
or
will
you
sit
down
like
cowards
while
they
hang
him
for
treason
his
voice
was
drowned
but
he
stood
immovable
with
arms
folded
until
there
was
silence
again
will
you
rescue
him
he
cried
and
the
roar
rose
again
will
you
avenge
him
by
we
shall
have
two
thousand
here
invade
north
carolina
humble
her
bring
her
to
her
knees
and
avenge
john
sevier
pandemonium
reigned
hats
were
flung
in
the
air
rifles
fired
shouts
and
curses
rose
and
blended
into
one
terrifying
note
gradually
in
the
midst
of
this
mad
uproar
the
crowd
became
aware
that
another
man
was
standing
upon
the
stump
from
which
nicholas
temple
had
leaped
cozby
some
one
yelled
cozby
the
cry
was
taken
up
huzzay
for
cozby
he
ll
lead
us
into
he
was
the
huge
swarthy
man
i
had
seen
riding
hard
with
nick
that
morning
a
sculptor
might
have
chosen
his
face
and
frame
for
a
type
of
the
leader
of
pioneers
will
was
supreme
in
the
great
features
inflexible
indomitable
will
his
hunting
shirt
was
open
across
his
great
chest
his
black
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
he
stood
with
a
compelling
hand
raised
for
silence
and
when
he
spoke
slowly
resonantly
men
fell
back
before
his
words
i
admire
temple
s
courage
and
above
all
his
loyalty
to
our
beloved
general
said
major
cozby
but
temple
is
young
and
the
heated
counsels
of
youth
must
not
prevail
my
friends
in
order
to
save
jack
sevier
we
must
be
his
voice
strong
as
it
was
was
lost
to
hell
with
moderation
they
shouted
down
with
north
carolina
we
ll
fight
her
he
got
silence
again
by
the
magnetic
strength
he
had
in
him
very
good
he
said
but
get
your
general
first
if
we
lead
you
across
the
mountains
now
his
blood
will
be
upon
your
heads
no
man
is
a
better
friend
to
jack
sevier
than
i
leave
his
rescue
to
me
and
i
will
get
him
for
he
paused
and
they
were
stilled
perforce
i
will
get
him
for
you
he
repeated
slowly
or
north
carolina
will
pay
for
the
burial
of
james
there
was
an
instant
when
they
might
have
swung
either
way
how
will
ye
do
it
came
in
a
thin
piping
voice
from
somewhere
near
the
stump
it
may
have
been
this
that
turned
their
minds
others
took
up
the
question
how
will
ye
do
it
major
cozby
i
don
t
know
cried
the
major
i
don
t
know
and
if
i
did
know
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
but
i
will
get
nollichucky
jack
if
i
have
to
burn
morganton
and
rake
the
general
out
of
the
cinders
five
hundred
hands
flew
up
five
hundred
voices
cried
i
m
with
ye
major
cozby
but
the
major
only
shook
his
head
and
smiled
what
he
said
was
lost
in
the
roar
fighting
my
way
forward
i
saw
him
get
down
from
the
stump
put
his
hand
kindly
on
nick
s
shoulder
and
lead
him
into
the
they
were
followed
by
a
score
of
others
and
the
door
was
shut
behind
them
it
was
then
i
bethought
myself
of
the
letter
to
wright
and
i
sought
for
some
one
who
would
listen
to
my
questions
as
to
his
whereabouts
at
length
the
man
himself
was
pointed
out
to
me
haranguing
an
excited
crowd
of
partisans
in
front
of
his
own
gate
some
twenty
minutes
must
have
passed
before
i
could
get
any
word
with
him
he
was
a
vigorous
little
man
with
black
eyes
like
buttons
he
wore
brown
homespun
and
white
stockings
and
his
hair
was
clubbed
when
he
had
yielded
the
ground
to
another
orator
i
handed
him
the
letter
he
drew
me
aside
read
it
on
the
spot
and
became
all
hospitality
at
once
the
town
was
full
and
though
he
had
several
friends
staying
in
his
house
i
should
join
them
was
my
horse
fed
dinner
had
been
forgotten
that
day
but
would
i
enter
and
partake
in
short
i
found
myself
suddenly
provided
for
and
i
lost
no
time
in
getting
my
weary
mount
into
wright
s
little
stable
and
then
i
sat
down
with
several
other
gentlemen
at
wright
s
board
where
there
was
much
guessing
as
to
major
cozby
s
plan
no
other
man
west
of
the
mountains
could
have
calmed
that
crowd
after
that
young
daredevil
temple
had
stirred
them
up
declared
wright
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
had
business
with
temple
faith
then
i
will
invite
him
here
said
my
host
but
i
warn
you
ritchie
that
he
is
a
trigger
set
on
the
hair
if
he
does
not
fancy
you
he
may
quarrel
with
you
and
shoot
you
and
he
is
in
no
temper
to
bectrifled
with
i
am
not
an
easy
person
to
quarrel
with
i
answered
to
look
at
you
i
shouldn
t
say
that
you
were
said
he
we
are
going
to
the
and
i
will
see
if
i
can
get
a
word
with
the
young
hotspur
and
send
him
to
you
do
you
wait
i
waited
on
the
porch
as
the
day
waned
the
tumult
of
the
place
had
died
down
for
men
were
gathering
in
the
houses
to
discuss
and
conjecture
and
presently
sauntering
along
the
street
in
a
careless
fashion
his
spurs
trailing
in
the
dust
came
nicholas
temple
he
stopped
before
the
house
and
stared
at
me
with
a
fine
insolence
and
i
wondered
whether
i
myself
had
not
been
too
hasty
in
reclaiming
him
a
greeting
died
on
my
lips
well
sir
he
said
so
you
are
the
gentleman
who
has
been
dogging
me
all
i
dog
no
one
temple
i
replied
bitterly
we
ll
not
quibble
about
words
said
he
would
it
be
impertinent
to
ask
your
business
and
perhaps
your
name
did
not
wright
give
you
my
name
i
exclaimed
he
might
have
mentioned
it
i
did
not
hear
is
it
of
such
importance
at
that
i
lost
my
temper
entirely
it
may
be
and
it
may
not
i
retorted
i
am
david
he
changed
before
my
eyes
as
he
stared
at
me
and
then
ere
i
knew
it
he
had
me
by
both
arms
crying
out
david
ritchie
my
davy
who
ran
away
from
me
and
we
were
going
to
kentucky
together
oh
i
have
never
forgiven
you
the
smile
that
there
was
no
resisting

his
words
as
he
put
his
face
close
to
mine
i
never
will
forgive
you
i
might
have
known

the
drive
and
to
the
it
was
not
ingratitude
nick
i
said
you
were
all
i
had
in
the
and
then
i
faltered
the
sadness
of
that
time
coming
over
me
in
a
flood
and
the
remembrance
of
his
generous
sorrow
for
me
and
how
the
devil
did
you
track
me

the
widow
brown

he
demanded

a
shrewd
notion

exclaimed
he
whom
you
got
into
the
duel
with
i
stopped
abruptly
with
a
sharp
twinge
of
remembrance
that
was
like
a
pain
in
my
side
twas
nick
took
up
the
name
with
harry
he
spoke
quietly
that
was
the
terrifying
part
of
it
david
i
ve
looked
for
that
man
in
italy
and
france
i
ve
scoured
london
for
him
and
by
god
i
ll
find
him
before
he
dies
and
when
i
do
find
him
i
swear
to
you
that
there
will
be
no
such
thing
as
time
wasted
or
i
shuddered
in
all
my
life
i
had
never
known
such
a
moment
of
indecision
should
i
tell
him
my
conscience
would
give
me
no
definite
reply
the
question
had
haunted
me
all
the
night
and
i
had
lost
my
way
in
consequence
nor
had
the
morning
s
ride
from
the
widow
brown
s
sufficed
to
bring
me
to
a
decision
of
what
use
to
tell
him
would
riddle
s
death
mend
matters
the
woman
loved
him
that
had
been
clear
to
me
yet
by
telling
nick
what
i
knew
i
might
induce
him
to
desist
from
his
search
and
if
i
did
not
tell
nick
might
some
day
run
across
the
trail
follow
it
up
take
riddle
s
life
and
lose
his
own
the
moment
made
for
confession
as
it
was
passed
they
have
ruined
my
life
said
nick
i
curse
him
and
i
curse
hold
i
cried
she
is
your
and
therefore
i
curse
her
the
more
he
said
you
know
what
she
is
you
ve
tasted
of
her
charity
and
you
are
my
father
s
nephew
if
you
have
been
without
experience
i
will
tell
you
what
she
is
a
common
i
reached
out
and
put
my
hand
across
his
mouth
silence
i
cried
you
shall
say
no
such
thing
and
have
you
not
manhood
enough
to
make
your
own
life
for
yourself
manhood
he
repeated
and
laughed
it
was
a
laugh
that
i
did
not
like
they
made
a
man
of
me
my
parents
my
father
played
false
with
the
rebels
and
fled
to
england
for
his
reward
a
year
after
he
went
i
was
left
alone
at
temple
bow
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
niggers
mason
came
back
and
snatched
what
was
left
of
me
he
was
a
good
man
he
saved
me
an
annuity
out
of
the
estate
he
took
me
abroad
after
the
war
on
a
grand
tour
and
died
of
a
fever
in
rome
i
made
my
way
back
to
charlestown
and
there
i
learned
to
gamble
to
hold
liquor
like
a
gentleman
to
run
horses
and
fight
like
a
gentleman
we
were
speaking
of
darnley
he
said
yes
of
darnley
i
repeated
the
devil
of
a
man
said
nick
do
you
remember
him
with
the
cracked
voice
and
fat
calves
at
any
other
time
i
should
have
laughed
at
the
recollection
darnley
turned
whig
became
a
continental
colonel
and
got
a
grant
out
here
in
the
cumberland
country
of
three
thousand
acres
and
now
i
own
you
own
it
i
exclaimed
said
nick
i
played
him
for
the
land
at
the
ordinary
one
night
and
won
it
it
is
out
here
near
a
place
called
nashboro
where
this
wild
jackson
says
he
is
going
soon
i
crossed
the
mountains
to
have
a
look
at
it
fell
in
with
nollichucky
jack
and
went
off
with
him
for
a
summer
campaign
there
s
a
man
for
you
davy
he
cried
a
man
to
follow
through
if
they
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
we
ll
sack
the
state
of
north
carolina
from
morganton
to
the
but

land
i
asked
oh

fig

the
land
answered
nick
as
soon
as
nollichucky
jack
is
safe
i
ll
follow
you
into
he
slapped
me
on
the
knee
egad
davy
it
seems
like
a
fairy
tale
we
always
said
we
were
going
to
kentucky
didn
t
we
what
is
the
name
of
the
place

are
to
startle
with
your
learning
and
calm
by
your
example
louisville
i
answered
laughing
by
the
falls
of
the
i
shall
turn
up
there
when
jack
sevier
is
safe
and
i
have
won
some
more
land
from

have
a
rare
old
time
together
though

have
no
doubt

can
drink
me
under
the
table
beware
of
these
sober
men
egad
davy
you
need
only
a
woolsack
to
become
a
judge
and
now
tell
me
how
fortune
has
buffeted
it
was
my
second
night
without
sleep
for
we
sat
burning
candles
in
wright
s
house
until
the
dawn
making
up
the
time
which
we
had
lost
away
from
each
other
chapter
vii
i
meet
a
hero
when
left
to
myself
i
was
wont
to
slide
into
the
commonplace
and
where
my
own
dull
life
intrudes
to
clog
the
action
i
cut
it
down
here
and
pare
it
away
there
until
i
am
merely
explanatory
and
not
too
much
in
evidence
i
rode
out
the
wilderness
trail
fell
in
with
other
travellers
was
welcomed
by
certain
old
familiar
faces
at
harrodstown
and
pressed
on
i
have
a
vivid
recollection
of
a
beloved
vigorous
figure
swooping
out
of
a
cabin
door
and
scattering
a
brood
of
children
right
and
left
polly
ann
i
said
and
she
halted
trembling
tom
she
cried
tom
it
s
davy
come
back
and
tom
himself
flew
out
of
the
door
ramrod
in
one
hand
and
rifle
in
the
other
never
shall
i
forget
them
as
they
stood
there
he
grinning
with
sheer
joy
as
of
yore
and
she
with
her
hair
flying
and
her
blue
gown
snapping
in
the
wind
in
a
tremor
between
tears
and
laughter
i
leaped
to
the
ground
and
she
hugged
me
in
her
arms
as
though
i
had
been
a
child
calling
my
name
again
and
again
and
little
tom
pulling
at
the
skirts
of
my
coat
i
caught
the
youngster
by
the
collar
polly
ann
said
i
he
s
grown
to
what
i
was
when
you
picked
me
up
a
and
now
it
s
little
davy
no
more
she
answered
swept
me
a
courtesy
and
added
with
a
little
quiver
in
her
voice
ye
are
a
gentleman
my
heart
is
still
where
it
was
said
i
ay
ay
said
tom
i
m
sure
o
that
i
was
with
them
a
fortnight
in
the
familiar
cabin
and
then
i
took
up
my
journey
northward
heavy
at
leaving
again
but
promising
to
see
them
from
time
to
time
for
tom
was
often
at
the
falls
when
he
went
into
the
illinois
country
it
was
as
of
old
polly
ann
who
ran
the
mill
and
was
the
real
of
the
family
louisville
was
even
then
bursting
with
importance
and
as
i
rode
into
it
one
bright
november
day
i
remembered
the
wilderness
i
had
seen
here
not
ten
years
gone
when
i
had
marched
hither
with
captain
harrod
s
company
to
join
clark
on
the
island
it
was
even
then
a
thriving
little
town
of
log
and
clapboard
houses
and
schools
and
churches
and
wise
men
were
saying
of
it
what
colonel
clark
had
long
ago
predicted
that
it
would
become
the
first
city
of
commercial
importance
in
the
district
of
kentucky
i
do
not
mean
to
give
you
an
account
of
my
struggles
that
winter
to
obtain
a
foothold
in
the
law
the
time
was
a
heyday
for
young
barristers
and
troubles
in
those
early
days
grew
as
plentifully
in
kentucky
as
corn
in
short
i
got
a
practice
for
colonel
clark
was
here
to
help
me
and
thanks
to
the
men
who
had
gone
to
kaskaskia
and
vincennes
i
had
a
fairly
large
acquaintance
in
kentucky
i
hired
rooms
behind
crede
s
store
which
was
famed
for
the
glass
windows
which
had
been
fetched
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
crede
was
the
embodiment
of
the
enterprising
spirit
of
the
place
and
often
of
an
evening
he
called
me
in
to
see
the
new
fashionable
things
his
barges
had
brought
down
the
ohio
the
next
day
certain
young
sparks
would
drop
into
my
room
to
waylay
the
belles
as
they
came
to
pick
a
costume
to
be
worn
at
nickle
s
dancing
school
or
at
the
ball
at
fort
finney
the
winter
slipped
away
and
one
cool
evening
in
may
there
came
a
negro
to
my
room
with
a
note
from
colonel
clark
bidding
me
sup
with
him
at
the
tavern
and
meet
a
celebrity
i
put
on
my
best
blue
clothes
that
i
had
brought
with
me
from
richmond
and
repaired
expectantly
to
the
tavern
about
eight
of
the
clock
pushed
through
the
curious
crowd
outside
and
entered
the
big
room
where
the
company
was
fast
assembling
against
the
red
blaze
in
the
great
i
spied
the
figure
of
colonel
clark
more
portly
than
of
yore
and
beside
him
stood
a
gentleman
who
could
be
no
other
than
general
wilkinson
he
was
a
man
to
fill
the
eye
handsome
of
face
symmetrical
of
figure
easy
of
manner
and
he
wore
a
suit
of
that
became
him
admirably
in
short
so
fascinated
and
absorbed
was
i
in
watching
him
as
he
greeted
this
man
and
the
other
that
i
started
as
though
something
had
pricked
me
when
i
heard
my
name
called
by
colonel
clark
come
here
davy
he
cried
across
the
room
and
i
came
and
stood
abashed
before
the
hero
general
allow
me
to
present
to
you
the
drummer
boy
of
kaskaskia
and
vincennes
david
i
hear
that
you
drummed
them
to
victory
through
a
very
hell
of
torture
ritchie
said
the
general
it
is
an
honor
to
grasp
the
hand
of
one
who
did
such
service
at
such
a
tender
general
wilkinson
availed
himself
of
that
honor
and
encompassed
me
with
a
smile
so
benignant
so
winning
in
its
candor
that
i
could
only
mutter
my
acknowledgment
and
colonel
clark
must
needs
apologize
laughing
for
my
youth
and
timidity
mr
ritchie
is
not
good
at
speeches
general
said
he
but
i
make
no
doubt
he
will
drink
a
bumper
to
your
health
before
we
sit
down
gentlemen
he
cried
filling
his
glass
from
a
bottle
on
the
table
a
toast
to
general
wilkinson
emancipator
and
saviour
of
kentucky
the
company
responded
with
a
shout
tossed
off
the
toast
and
sat
down
at
the
long
table
chance
placed
me
between
a
young
dandy
from
lexington
one
of
several
the
general
had
brought
in
his
train
and
wharton
a
prominent
planter
of
the
neighborhood
with
whom
i
had
a
speaking
acquaintance
this
was
a
backwoods
feast
though
served
in
something
better
than
the
old
backwoods
style
and
we
had
venison
and
bear
s
meat
and
prairie
fowl
as
well
as
pork
and
beef
and
breads
that
came
stinging
hot
from
the
dutch
ovens
toasts
to
this
and
that
were
flung
back
and
forth
and
jests
and
gibes
and
the
butt
of
many
of
these
was
that
poor
federal
government
which
as
one
gentleman
avowed
was
like
a
bantam
hen
trying
to
cover
a
nestful
of
turkey
s
eggs
and
clucking
with
importance
all
the
time
this
picture
brought
on
gusts
of
laughter
and
what
say
you
of
the
jay
cried
one
what
will
he
hatch
hisses
greeted
the
name
for
jay
wished
to
enter
into
a
treaty
with
spain
agreeing
to
close
the
river
for
five
and
twenty
years
colonel
clark
stood
up
and
rapped
on
the
table
gentlemen
said
he
louisville
has
as
her
guest
of
honor
a
man
of
whom
kentucky
may
well
be
proud
loud
cheering
five
years
ago
he
favored
lexington
by
making
it
his
home
and
he
came
to
us
with
the
laurel
of
former
achievements
still
clinging
to
his
brow
he
fought
and
suffered
for
his
country
and
attained
the
honorable
rank
of
major
in
the
continental
line
he
was
chosen
by
the
people
of
pennsylvania
to
represent
them
in
the
august
body
of
their
legislature
and
now
he
has
got
new
honor
in
a
new
field
renewed
cheering
he
has
come
to
kentucky
to
show
her
the
way
to
prosperity
and
glory
kentucky
had
a
grievance
loud
cries
of
yes
yes
her
hogs
and
cattle
had
no
market
her
tobacco
and
agricultural
products
of
all
kinds
were
rotting
because
the
spaniards
had
closed
the
mississippi
to
our
traffic
could
the
federal
government
open
the
river
shouts
of
no
no
and
hisses
who
opened
it
cries
of
wilkinson
wilkinson
he
said
to
the
kentucky
planters
give
your
tobacco
to
me
and
i
will
sell
he
put
it
in
barges
he
floated
down
the
river
and
as
became
a
man
of
such
distinction
he
was
met
by
miro
on
the
levee
at
new
orleans
where
is
that
tobacco
now
gentlemen
colonel
clark
was
here
interrupted
by
such
roars
and
stamping
that
he
paused
a
moment
and
during
this
interval
wharton
leaned
over
and
whispered
quietly
in
my
ear
ay
where
is
it
i
stared
at
wharton
blankly
he
was
a
man
nearing
the
middle
age
with
a
lacing
of
red
in
his
cheeks
a
pleasant
gray
eye
and
a
singularly
quiet
manner
thanks
to
the
genius
of
general
wilkinson
colonel
clark
continued
waving
his
hand
towards
the
smilingly
placid
hero
that
tobacco
has
been
deposited
in
the
king
s
store
at
ten
dollars
per
hundred
a
privilege
heretofore
confined
to
spanish
subjects
well
might
wilkinson
return
from
new
orleans
in
a
chariot
and
four
to
a
grateful
kentucky
this
year
we
have
tripled
nay
quadrupled
our
crop
of
tobacco
and
we
are
here
to
give
thanks
to
the
author
of
this
alas
colonel
clark
s
hand
was
not
as
steady
as
of
yore
and
he
spilled
the
liquor
on
the
table
as
he
raised
his
glass
gentlemen
a
health
to
our
they
drank
it
willingly
and
withal
so
lengthily
and
noisily
that
wilkinson
stood
smiling
and
bowing
for
full
three
minutes
before
he
could
be
heard
he
was
a
very
paragon
of
modesty
was
the
general
and
a
man
whose
attitudes
and
expressions
spoke
as
eloquently
as
his
words
none
looked
at
him
now
but
knew
before
he
opened
his
mouth
that
he
was
deprecating
such
an
ovation
gentlemen
my
friends
and
he
said
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
your
kindness
but
i
assure
you
that
i
have
done
nothing
worthy
of
it
loud
protests
i
am
a
simple
practical
man
who
loves
kentucky
better
than
he
loves
himself
this
is
no
virtue
for
we
all
have
it
we
have
the
misfortune
to
be
governed
by
a
set
of
worthy
gentlemen
who
know
little
about
kentucky
and
her
wants
and
think
less
cries
of
ay
ay
i
am
not
decrying
general
washington
and
his
cabinet
it
is
but
natural
that
the
wants
of
the
seaboard
and
the
welfare
and
opulence
of
the
eastern
cities
should
be
uppermost
in
their
minds
another
interruption
kentucky
if
she
would
prosper
must
look
to
her
own
welfare
and
if
any
credit
is
due
to
me
gentlemen
it
is
because
i
reserved
my
decision
of
his
excellency
miro
and
his
people
until
i
saw
them
for
myself
a
little
calm
reason
a
plain
statement
of
the
case
will
often
remove
what
seems
an
insuperable
difficulty
and
i
assure
you
that
miro
is
a
most
reasonable
and
courteous
gentleman
who
looks
with
all
kindliness
and
neighborliness
on
the
people
of
kentucky
let
us
drink
a
toast
to
him
to
him
your
gratitude
is
due
for
he
sends
you
word
that
your
tobacco
will
be
in
general
wilkinson
s
barges
said
wharton
leaning
over
and
subsiding
again
at
once
the
general
was
the
first
to
drink
the
toast
and
he
sat
down
very
modestly
amidst
a
thunder
of
applause
the
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
me
somewhat
flushed
leaped
to
his
feet
down
with
the
federal
government
he
cried
what
have
they
done
for
us
indeed
before
general
wilkinson
went
to
new
orleans
the
spaniards
seized
our
flat
boats
and
cargoes
and
flung
our
traders
into
prison
ay
and
sent
them
to
the
mines
of
brazil
the
federal
government
takes
sides
with
the
indians
against
us
and
what
has
that
government
done
for
you
colonel
he
demanded
turning
to
clark
you
who
have
won
for
them
half
of
their
territory
they
have
cast
you
off
like
an
old
moccasin
the
continental
officers
who
fought
in
the
east
have
for
life
or
five
years
full
pay
and
what
have
you
there
was
a
breathless
hush
a
swift
vision
came
to
me
of
a
man
young
alert
commanding
stern
under
necessity
at
all
times
a
man
who
by
the
very
dominance
of
his
character
had
awed
into
submission
the
fierce
northern
tribes
of
a
continent
who
had
compelled
men
to
follow
him
until
the
life
had
all
but
ebbed
from
their
bodies
who
had
led
them
to
victory
in
the
end
and
i
remembered
a
boy
who
had
stood
before
this
man
in
the
commandant
s
house
at
fort
sackville
ay
and
i
heard
again
his
words
as
though
he
had
just
spoken
them
promise
me
that
you
will
not
forget
me
if
i
am
i
did
not
understand
then
and
now
because
of
a
certain
blinding
of
my
eyes
i
did
not
see
him
clearly
as
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
he
clutched
the
table
he
looked
around
him
i
dare
not
say
vacantly
and
then
suddenly
he
spoke
with
a
supreme
anger
and
a
supreme
bitterness
not
a
shilling
has
this
government
given
me
he
cried
virginia
has
more
grateful
from
her
i
have
some
acres
of
wild
land
and
a
he
laughed
a
sword
gentlemen
and
not
new
at
that
oh
a
grateful
government
we
serve
one
careful
of
the
honor
of
her
captains
gentlemen
i
stand
a
discredited
man
because
the
honest
debts
i
incurred
in
the
service
of
that
government
are
repudiated
because
my
friends
who
helped
it
father
gibault
vigo
and
gratiot
and
others
have
never
been
repaid
one
of
them
is
a
dozen
men
had
sprung
clamoring
to
their
feet
before
he
sat
down
one
more
excited
than
the
rest
got
the
ear
of
the
company
do
we
lack
leaders
he
cried
we
have
them
here
with
us
in
this
room
who
will
stop
us
not
the
contemptible
enemies
in
kentucky
who
call
themselves
federalists
shall
we
be
supine
forever
we
have
fought
once
for
our
liberties
let
us
fight
again
let
us
make
a
common
cause
with
our
real
friends
on
the
far
side
of
the
i
rose
sick
at
heart
but
every
man
was
standing
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
i
saw
general
wilkinson
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
his
hand
was
raised
and
there
was
that
on
his
handsome
face
which
might
have
been
taken
for
a
smile
and
yet
was
not
a
smile
others
saw
him
too
i
know
not
by
what
exertion
of
magnetism
they
looked
at
him
and
they
held
their
tongues
i
fear
that
we
are
losing
our
heads
gentlemen
he
said
and
i
propose
to
you
the
health
of
the
first
citizen
of
kentucky
colonel
george
george
rogers
i
found
myself
out
of
the
tavern
and
alone
in
the
cool
may
night
and
as
i
walked
slowly
down
the
deserted
street
my
head
in
a
whirl
a
hand
was
laid
on
my
shoulder
i
turned
startled
to
face
wharton
the
planter
i
would
speak
a
word
with
you
ritchie
he
said
may
i
come
to
your
room
for
a
moment
certainly
sir
i
answered
after
that
we
walked
along
together
in
silence
my
own
mind
heavily
occupied
with
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
we
came
to
crede
s
store
went
in
at
the
picket
gate
beside
it
and
down
the
path
to
my
own
door
which
i
unlocked
i
felt
for
the
candle
on
the
table
lighted
it
and
turned
in
surprise
to
discover
that
wharton
was
poking
up
the
fire
and
pitching
on
a
log
of
wood
he
flung
off
his
greatcoat
and
sat
down
with
his
feet
to
the
blaze
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
waited
thinking
him
a
sufficiently
peculiar
man
you
are
not
famous
ritchie
said
he
presently
no
sir
i
answered
nor
particularly
handsome
he
continued
nor
conspicuous
in
any
i
agreed
to
this
perforce
you
may
thank
god
for
it
said
wharton
that
would
be
a
strange
outpouring
sir
said
i
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
what
think
you
of
this
paragon
general
wilkinson
he
demanded
suddenly
i
have
federal
leanings
sir
i
answered
egad
said
he
we
ll
add
caution
to
your
lack
of
negative
accomplishments
i
have
had
an
eye
on
you
this
winter
though
you
did
not
know
it
i
have
made
inquiries
about
you
and
hence
i
am
not
here
entirely
through
impulse
you
have
not
made
a
fortune
at
the
law
but
you
have
worked
hard
steered
wide
of
sensation
kept
your
mouth
shut
is
it
not
so
astonished
i
merely
nodded
in
reply
i
am
not
here
to
waste
your
time
or
steal
your
sleep
he
went
on
giving
the
log
a
push
with
his
foot
and
i
will
come
to
the
point
when
first
laid
eyes
on
this
fine
gentleman
general
wilkinson
i
too
fell
a
victim
to
his
charms
it
was
on
the
eve
of
this
trip
of
which
we
heard
so
glowing
an
account
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
no
spaniard
however
wily
could
resist
his
persuasion
he
said
to
me
wharton
give
me
your
crop
of
tobacco
and
i
promise
you
to
sell
it
in
spite
of
all
the
royal
mandates
that
go
out
of
he
went
he
saw
he
conquered
the
obdurate
miro
as
he
has
apparently
conquered
the
rest
of
the
world
and
he
actually
came
back
in
a
chariot
and
four
as
befitted
him
a
heavy
crop
of
tobacco
was
raised
in
kentucky
that
year
i
helped
to
raise
it
added
wharton
dryly
i
gave
the
general
my
second
crop
and
he
sent
it
down
ritchie
i
have
to
this
day
never
received
a
piastre
for
my
merchandise
nor
am
i
the
only
planter
in
this
situation
yet
general
wilkinson
is
my
astonishment
somewhat
prevented
me
from
replying
to
this
too
was
it
possible
that
wharton
meant
to
sue
the
general
i
reflected
while
he
paused
i
remembered
how
inconspicuous
he
had
named
me
and
hope
died
wharton
did
not
look
at
me
but
stared
into
the
fire
for
he
was
plainly
not
a
man
to
rail
and
rant
mr
ritchie
you
are
young
but
mark
my
words
that
man
wilkinson
will
bring
kentucky
to
ruin
if
he
is
not
found
out
the
whole
district
from
crab
orchard
to
bear
grass
is
mad
about
him
even
clark
makes
a
fool
of
himself
colonel
clark
sir
i
cried
he
put
up
a
hand
so
you
have
some
hot
blood
he
said
i
know
you
love
him
so
do
i
or
i
should
not
have
been
there
tonight
do
i
blame
his
bitterness
do
i
blame
anything
he
does
the
treatment
he
has
had
would
bring
a
blush
of
shame
to
the
cheek
of
any
nation
save
a
republic
republics
are
wasteful
sir
in
george
rogers
clark
they
have
thrown
away
a
general
who
might
some
day
have
decided
the
fate
of
this
country
they
have
left
to
stagnate
a
man
fit
to
lead
a
nation
to
war
and
now
he
is
ready
to
intrigue
against
the
government
with
any
adventurer
who
may
have
convincing
ways
and
a
smooth
mr
wharton
i
said
rising
did
you
come
here
to
tell
me
this
but
wharton
continued
to
stare
into
the
fire
i
like
you
the
better
for
it
my
dear
sir
said
he
and
i
assure
you
that
i
mean
no
offence
colonel
clark
is
enshrined
in
our
hearts
democrats
and
federalists
alike
whatever
he
may
do
we
shall
love
him
always
but
this
other
man
pooh
he
exclaimed
which
was
as
near
a
vigorous
expression
as
he
got
now
sir
to
the
point
i
too
am
a
federalist
a
friend
of
humphrey
marshall
and
as
you
know
we
are
sadly
in
the
minority
in
kentucky
now
i
came
here
to
ask
you
to
undertake
a
mission
in
behalf
of
myself
and
certain
other
gentlemen
and
i
assure
you
that
my
motives
are
not
wholly
he
paused
smiled
and
put
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
i
would
willingly
lose
every
crop
for
the
next
ten
years
to
convict
this
wilkinson
of
treason
against
the
federal
treason
i
repeated
involuntarily
mr
ritchie
answered
the
planter
i
gave
you
credit
for
some
shrewdness
do
you
suppose
the
federal
government
does
not
realize
the
danger
of
this
situation
in
kentucky
they
have
tried
in
vain
to
open
the
mississippi
and
are
too
weak
to
do
it
this
man
wilkinson
goes
down
to
see
miro
and
miro
straightway
opens
the
river
to
us
through
him
how
do
you
suppose
wilkinson
did
it
by
his
charming
personality
i
said
something
i
know
not
what
as
the
light
began
to
dawn
on
me
and
then
i
added
i
had
not
thought
about
the
ah
replied
wharton
just
so
and
now
you
may
easily
imagine
that
general
wilkinson
has
come
to
a
very
pretty
arrangement
with
miro
for
a
certain
stipulated
sum
best
known
to
wilkinson
and
miro
general
wilkinson
agrees
gradually
to
detach
kentucky
from
the
union
and
join
it
to
his
catholic
majesty
s
dominion
of
louisiana
the
bribe
the
opening
of
the
river
what
the
government
could
not
do
wilkinson
did
by
the
lifting
of
his
still
wharton
spoke
without
heat
mind
you
he
said
we
have
no
proof
of
this
and
that
is
my
reason
for
coming
here
ritchie
i
want
you
to
get
proof
of
it
if
you
you
want
me
i
said
bewildered
i
repeat
that
you
are
not
handsome
i
think
he
emphasized
this
unduly
that
you
are
inconspicuous
in
short
you
are
not
a
man
to
draw
suspicion
you
might
travel
anywhere
and
scarcely
be
noticed
i
have
observed
that
about
you
in
addition
to
this
you
are
wary
you
are
discreet
you
are
painstaking
i
ask
you
to
go
first
to
louis
in
louisiana
territory
and
this
for
two
reasons
first
because
it
will
draw
any
chance
suspicion
from
your
real
objective
new
orleans
and
second
because
it
is
necessary
to
get
letters
to
new
orleans
from
such
leading
citizens
of
louis
as
colonel
chouteau
and
monsieur
gratiot
and
i
will
give
you
introductions
to
them
you
are
then
to
take
passage
to
new
orleans
in
a
barge
of
furs
which
monsieur
gratiot
is
sending
down
mind
we
do
not
expect
that
you
will
obtain
proof
that
miro
is
paying
wilkinson
money
if
you
do
so
much
the
better
but
we
believe
that
both
are
too
sharp
to
leave
any
tracks
you
will
make
a
report
however
upon
the
conditions
under
which
our
tobacco
is
being
received
and
of
all
other
matters
which
you
may
think
germane
to
the
business
in
hand
will
you
go
i
had
made
up
my
mind
yes
i
will
go
i
answered
good
said
wharton
but
with
no
more
enthusiasm
than
he
had
previously
shown
i
thought
i
had
not
misjudged
you
is
your
law
business
so
onerous
that
you
could
not
go
i
laughed
i
think
i
could
settle
what
affairs
i
have
by
noon
wharton
i
replied
egad
ritchie
i
like
your
manner
said
he
and
now
for
a
few
details
and
you
may
go
to
he
sat
with
me
half
an
hour
longer
carefully
reviewing
his
instructions
and
then
he
left
me
to
a
night
of
contemplation
chapter
viii
to
louis
by
eleven
o
clock
the
next
morning
i
had
wound
up
my
affairs
having
arranged
with
a
young
lawyer
of
my
acquaintance
to
take
over
such
cases
as
i
had
and
i
was
busy
in
my
room
packing
my
for
the
journey
the
warm
scents
of
spring
were
wafted
through
the
open
door
and
window
smells
of
the
damp
earth
giving
forth
the
green
things
and
tender
shades
greeted
my
eyes
when
i
paused
and
raised
my
head
to
think
purple
buds
littered
the
black
ground
before
my
and
against
the
living
green
of
the
grass
i
saw
the
red
stain
of
a
robin
s
breast
as
he
hopped
spasmodically
hither
and
thither
now
pausing
immovable
with
his
head
raised
now
tossing
triumphantly
a
wriggling
worm
from
the
sod
suddenly
he
flew
away
and
i
heard
a
voice
from
the
street
side
that
brought
me
stark
upright
hold
there
neighbor
can
you
direct
me
to
the
mansion
of
that
celebrated
barrister
ritchie
there
was
no
mistaking
that
voice
it
was
nicholas
temple
s
i
heard
a
laugh
and
an
answer
the
gate
slammed
and
temple
himself
in
a
long
gray
booted
and
spurred
stood
before
me
davy
he
cried
come
out
here
and
hug
me
why
you
look
as
if
i
were
your
grandmother
s
and
if
you
were
i
answered
you
could
not
have
surprised
me
more
where
have
you
been
at
jonesboro
acting
the
gallant
with
the
widow
winning
and
losing
skins
and
and
land
at
with
that
wild
jackson
faith
he
near
shot
the
top
of
my
head
off
because
i
beat
him
at
greasy
i
laughed
despite
my
anxiety
and
sevier
i
demanded
you
have
not
heard
how
sevier
got
off
exclaimed
nick
egad
that
was
a
crowning
stroke
of
genius
cozby
and
evans
captains
greene
and
gibson
and
sevier
s
two
boys
whom
you
met
on
the
nollichucky
rode
over
the
mountains
to
morganton
greene
and
gibson
and
sevier
s
boys
hid
themselves
with
the
horses
in
a
clump
outside
the
town
while
cozby
and
evans
disguised
as
bumpkins
in
hunting
shirts
jogged
into
the
town
with
sevier
s
racing
mare
between
them
they
jogged
into
the
town
i
say
through
the
crowds
of
white
trash
and
rode
up
to
the
where
sevier
was
being
tried
for
his
life
evans
stood
at
the
open
door
and
held
the
mare
and
gaped
while
cozby
stalked
in
and
shouldered
his
way
to
the
front
within
four
feet
of
the
bar
like
a
big
awkward
countryman
jack
sevier
saw
him
and
he
saw
evans
with
the
mare
outside
then
by
thunder
cozby
takes
a
step
right
up
to
the
bar
and
cries
out
judge
aren
t
you
about
done
with
that
man
faith
it
was
like
judgment
day
such
a
as
there
was
after
that
and
nollichucky
jack
made
three
leaps
and
got
on
the
mare
and
in
the
confusion
cozby
and
evans
were
off
too
and
the
whole
state
of
north
carolina
couldn
t
catch
em
nick
sighed
i
d
have
given
my
soul
to
have
been
there
he
said
come
in
said
i
for
lack
of
something
better
cursed
if
you
haven
t
given
me
a
sweet
reception
davy
said
he
have
you
lost
your
practice
or
is
there
a
lady
here
you
rogue
and
he
poked
into
the
cupboard
with
his
stick
hullo
where
are
you
going
now
he
added
his
eye
falling
on
the
i
had
it
on
my
lips
to
say
and
then
i
remembered
wharton
s
injunction
i
m
going
on
a
journey
said
i
when
said
nick
i
leave
in
about
an
hour
said
i
he
sat
down
then
i
leave
too
he
said
what
do
you
mean
nick
i
demanded
i
mean
that
i
will
go
with
you
said
he
but
i
shall
be
gone
three
months
or
more
i
protested
i
have
nothing
to
do
said
nick
placidly
a
vague
trouble
had
been
working
in
my
mind
but
now
the
full
horror
of
it
dawned
upon
me
i
was
going
to
louis
temple
and
harry
riddle
were
gone
there
so
polly
ann
had
avowed
and
nick
could
not
help
meeting
riddle
sorely
beset
i
bent
over
to
roll
up
a
shirt
and
refrained
from
answering
he
came
and
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
what
the
devil
ails
you
davy
he
cried
if
it
is
an
elopement
of
course
i
won
t
press
you
i
m
hanged
if
i
ll
make
a
it
is
no
elopement
i
retorted
my
face
growing
hot
in
spite
of
myself
then
i
go
with
you
said
he
for
i
vow
you
need
taking
care
of
you
can
t
put
me
off
i
say
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
had
such
a
reception
and
from
my
own
first
cousin
i
was
in
a
quandary
so
totally
unforeseen
was
this
situation
and
then
a
glimmer
of
hope
came
to
me
that
perhaps
his
mother
and
riddle
might
not
be
in
louis
after
all
i
recalled
the
conversation
in
the
cabin
and
reflected
that
this
wayward
pair
had
stranded
on
so
many
beaches
had
drifted
off
again
on
so
many
tides
that
one
place
could
scarce
hold
them
long
perchance
they
had
sunk
who
could
tell
i
turned
to
nick
who
stood
watching
me
it
was
not
that
i
did
not
want
you
i
said
you
must
believe
that
i
have
wanted
you
ever
since
that
night
long
ago
when
i
slipped
out
of
your
bed
and
ran
away
i
am
going
first
to
louis
and
then
to
new
orleans
on
a
mission
of
much
delicacy
a
mission
that
requires
discretion
and
secrecy
you
may
come
with
all
my
heart
with
one
condition
only
that
you
do
not
ask
my
done
cried
nick
davy
i
was
always
sure
of
you
you
are
the
one
fixed
quantity
in
my
life
to
louis
eh
and
to
new
orleans
egad
what
havoc
we
ll
make
among
the
creole
girls
may
i
bring
my
nigger
he
ll
do
things
for
you
by
all
means
said
i
laughing
only
i
ll
run
to
the
inn
said
nick
and
be
back
in
ten
he
got
as
far
as
the
door
slapped
his
thigh
and
looked
back
davy
we
may
run
across
who
i
asked
with
a
catch
of
my
breath
harry
riddle
he
answered
and
if
so
may
god
have
mercy
on
his
soul
he
ran
down
the
path
the
gate
clicked
and
i
heard
him
whistling
in
the
street
on
his
way
to
the
inn
after
dinner
we
rode
down
to
the
ferry
nick
on
the
thoroughbred
which
had
beat
jackson
s
horse
and
his
man
benjy
on
a
scraggly
pony
behind
benjy
was
a
small
black
negro
with
a
very
squat
nose
alert
and
talkative
save
when
nick
turned
on
him
benjy
had
been
born
at
temple
bow
he
worshipped
his
master
and
all
that
pertained
to
him
and
he
showered
upon
me
all
the
respect
and
attention
that
was
due
to
a
member
of
the
temple
family
for
this
i
was
very
grateful
it
would
have
been
an
easier
journey
had
we
taken
a
boat
down
to
fort
massac
but
such
a
proceeding
might
have
drawn
too
much
attention
to
our
expedition
i
have
no
space
to
describe
that
trip
overland
which
reminded
me
at
every
stage
of
the
march
against
kaskaskia
the
woods
the
chocolate
streams
the
swamps
flecked
with
dead
leaves
and
at
length
the
prairies
the
grass
not
now
but
young
and
tender
giving
forth
the
acrid
smell
of
spring
nick
was
delighted
he
made
me
recount
every
detail
of
my
trials
as
a
drummer
boy
or
kept
me
in
continuous
spells
of
laughter
over
his
own
escapades
in
short
i
began
to
realize
that
we
were
as
near
to
each
other
as
though
we
had
never
been
parted
we
looked
down
upon
kaskaskia
from
the
spot
where
i
had
stood
on
the
bluff
with
colonel
clark
and
the
sounds
were
even
then
the
same
the
sweet
tones
of
the
church
bell
and
the
lowing
of
the
cattle
we
found
a
few
virginians
and
pennsylvanians
scattered
in
amongst
the
french
the
forerunners
of
that
change
which
was
to
come
over
this
country
and
we
spent
the
night
with
my
old
friend
father
gibault
still
the
faithful
pastor
of
his
flock
cheerful
though
the
savings
of
his
lifetime
had
never
been
repaid
by
that
country
to
which
he
had
given
his
allegiance
so
freely
travelling
by
easy
stages
on
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
after
leaving
kaskaskia
we
picked
our
way
down
the
high
bluff
that
rises
above
the
american
bottom
and
saw
below
us
that
yellow
monster
among
the
rivers
the
mississippi
a
blind
monster
he
seemed
searching
with
troubled
arms
among
the
islands
for
his
bed
swept
onward
by
an
inexorable
force
and
on
his
heaving
shoulders
he
carried
great
trees
pilfered
from
the
unknown
forests
of
the
north
down
in
the
moist
and
shady
bottom
we
came
upon
the
log
hut
of
a
trapper
and
he
agreed
to
ferry
us
across
as
for
our
horses
a
keel
boat
must
be
sent
after
these
and
monsieur
gratiot
would
no
doubt
easily
arrange
for
this
and
so
we
found
ourselves
about
five
o
clock
on
that
saturday
evening
embarked
in
a
wide
pirogue
on
the
current
dodging
the
driftwood
avoiding
the
eddies
and
drawing
near
to
a
village
set
on
a
low
bluff
on
the
spanish
side
and
gleaming
white
among
the
trees
and
as
i
looked
the
thought
came
again
like
a
twinge
of
pain
that
temple
and
riddle
might
be
there
thinking
themselves
secure
in
this
spot
so
removed
from
the
world
and
its
doings
how
now
my
man
of
mysterious
affairs
cried
nick
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
you
are
as
puckered
as
a
sour
persimmon
have
you
a
treaty
with
spain
in
your
pocket
or
a
declaration
of
war
what
can
trouble
you
nothing
if
you
do
not
i
answered
smiling
lord
send
we
don
t
admire
the
same
lady
then
said
nick
pierrot
he
cried
turning
to
one
of
the
boatmen
il
y
a
des
belles
demoiselles
là
n
pas
the
man
missed
a
stroke
in
his
astonishment
and
the
boat
swung
lengthwise
in
the
swift
current
dame
monsieur
il
y
en
a
he
answered
where
did
you
learn
french
nick
i
demanded
mr
mason
had
it
hammered
into
me
he
answered
carelessly
his
eyes
on
the
line
of
keel
boats
moored
along
the
shore
our
guides
shot
the
canoe
deftly
between
two
of
these
the
prow
grounded
in
the
yellow
mud
and
we
landed
on
spanish
territory
we
looked
about
us
while
our
packs
were
being
unloaded
and
the
place
had
a
strange
flavor
in
that
year
of
our
lord
a
swarthy
boatman
in
a
tow
shirt
with
a
bright
handkerchief
on
his
head
stared
at
us
over
the
gunwale
of
one
of
the
keel
boats
and
spat
into
the
still
yellow
water
three
indians
with
smudgy
faces
and
dirty
red
blankets
regarded
us
in
silent
contempt
and
by
the
above
us
was
a
sled
loaded
with
a
huge
water
cask
a
bony
mustang
pony
between
the
shafts
and
a
chanting
negro
dipping
gourdfuls
from
the
river
a
road
slanted
up
the
little
limestone
bluff
and
above
and
below
us
stone
houses
could
be
seen
nestling
into
the
hill
houses
higher
on
the
river
side
and
with
galleries
there
we
climbed
the
bluff
benjy
at
our
heels
with
the
and
found
ourselves
on
a
street
lined
with
grass
and
wild
flowers
a
great
peace
hung
over
the
village
an
air
of
a
different
race
a
restfulness
strange
to
a
kentuckian
clematis
and
honeysuckle
climbed
the
high
palings
and
behind
the
privacy
of
these
low
houses
of
limestone
weathered
gray
could
be
seen
their
roofs
sloping
in
gentle
curves
to
the
shaded
porches
in
front
or
again
houses
of
posts
set
upright
in
the
ground
and
these
filled
between
with
plaster
and
so
immaculately
whitewashed
that
they
gleamed
against
the
green
of
the
trees
which
shaded
them
behind
the
houses
was
often
a
kind
of
paradise
of
flowering
fruit
trees
so
dear
to
the
french
settlers
there
were
vineyards
too
and
thrifty
patches
of
vegetables
and
lines
of
flowers
set
in
the
carefully
raked
mould
we
walked
on
enraptured
by
the
sights
around
us
by
the
heavy
scent
of
the
roses
and
the
blossoms
here
was
a
quaint
stone
a
stable
or
a
barn
set
uncouthly
on
the
street
a
baker
s
shop
with
a
glimpse
of
the
baker
through
the
shaded
doorway
and
an
appetizing
smell
of
hot
bread
in
the
air
a
little
farther
on
we
heard
the
tinkle
of
the
blacksmith
s
hammer
and
the
man
himself
looked
up
from
where
the
hoof
rested
on
his
leather
apron
to
give
us
a
kindly
bon
soir
messieurs
as
we
passed
and
here
was
a
cabaret
with
the
inevitable
porch
from
whence
came
the
sharp
click
of
billiard
balls
we
walked
on
stopping
now
and
again
to
peer
between
the
palings
when
we
heard
amidst
the
rattling
of
a
cart
and
the
jingling
of
bells
a
chorus
of
voices
à
cheval
à
cheval
pour
aller
voir
ma
mie
lon
lon
la
a
shaggy
indian
pony
came
ambling
around
the
corner
between
the
long
shafts
of
a
charette
a
bareheaded
young
man
in
tow
shirt
and
trousers
was
driving
and
three
laughing
girls
were
seated
on
the
stools
in
the
cart
behind
him
suddenly
before
i
quite
realized
what
had
happened
the
young
man
pulled
up
the
pony
the
girls
fell
silent
and
nick
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
bowing
elaborately
je
vous
salue
mesdemoiselles
he
cried
mes
anges
à
me
diriger
chez
monsieur
gratiot
sapristi
exclaimed
the
young
man
but
he
laughed
the
young
women
stood
up
giggling
and
peered
at
nick
over
the
young
man
s
shoulder
one
of
them
wore
a
fresh
calamanco
gown
she
had
a
complexion
of
ivory
tinged
with
red
raven
hair
and
dusky
mischievous
eyes
brimming
with
merriment
volontiers
monsieur
she
answered
before
the
others
could
catch
their
breath
première
droite
et
première
gauche
allons
gaspard
she
cried
tapping
the
young
man
sharply
on
the
shoulder
es
tu
fou
gaspard
came
to
himself
flicked
the
pony
and
they
went
off
down
the
road
with
shouts
of
laughter
while
nick
stood
waving
his
hat
until
they
turned
the
corner
egad
said
he
i
d
take
to
the
highway
if
i
could
be
sure
of
holding
up
such
a
cargo
every
time
off
with
you
benjy
and
find
out
where
she
lives
he
cried
and
the
obedient
benjy
dropped
the
as
though
such
commands
were
not
uncommon
pick
up
those
bags
benjy
said
i
laughing
benjy
glanced
uncertainly
at
his
master
do
as
i
tell
you
you
black
scalawag
said
nick
or
i
ll
tan
you
what
are
you
waiting
for
marse
dave
began
benjy
rolling
his
eyes
in
discomfiture
look
you
nick
temple
said
i
when
you
shipped
with
me
you
promised
that
i
should
command
i
can
t
afford
to
have
the
town
about
our
oh
very
well
if
you
put
it
that
way
said
nick
a
little
honest
diversion
pick
up
the
bags
benjy
and
follow
the
obeying
mademoiselle
s
directions
we
trudged
on
until
we
came
to
a
comfortable
stone
house
surrounded
by
trees
and
set
in
a
bordered
by
a
paling
hardly
had
we
opened
the
gate
when
a
tall
gentleman
of
grave
demeanor
and
sober
dress
rose
from
his
seat
on
the
porch
and
i
recognized
my
friend
of
cahokia
days
monsieur
gratiot
he
was
a
little
more
portly
his
hair
was
dressed
now
in
an
eelskin
and
he
looked
every
inch
the
man
of
affairs
that
he
was
he
greeted
us
kindly
and
bade
us
come
up
on
the
porch
where
he
read
my
letter
of
introduction
why
he
exclaimed
immediately
giving
me
a
cordial
grasp
of
the
hand
of
course
the
strategist
the
john
law
the
reader
of
character
of
colonel
clark
s
army
yes
and
worse
the
prophet
and
why
worse
sir
i
asked
you
predicted
that
congress
would
never
repay
me
for
the
little
loan
i
advanced
to
your
it
was
not
such
a
little
loan
monsieur
i
said
n
importe
said
he
i
went
to
richmond
with
my
box
of
scrip
and
promissory
notes
but
i
was
not
ill
repaid
if
i
did
not
get
my
money
i
acquired
at
least
a
host
of
distinguished
acquaintances
but
ritchie
you
must
introduce
me
to
your
my
cousin
nicholas
temple
i
said
monsieur
gratiot
looked
at
him
fixedly
of
the
charlestown
temples
he
asked
and
a
sudden
vague
fear
seized
me
yes
said
nick
there
was
once
a
family
of
that
and
now
said
monsieur
gratiot
puzzled
now
said
nick
now
they
are
become
a
worthless
lot
of
refugees
and
outlaws
who
by
good
fortune
have
escaped
the
before
monsieur
gratiot
could
answer
a
child
came
running
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
stood
surprised
staring
at
us
nick
made
a
face
stooped
down
and
twirled
his
finger
shouting
with
a
terrified
glee
the
boy
fled
to
the
garden
path
nick
after
him
i
like
temple
said
monsieur
gratiot
smiling
he
is
young
but
he
seems
to
have
had
a
the
revolution
ruined
many
families
his
was
one
i
answered
with
what
firmness
of
tone
i
could
muster
and
then
nick
came
back
carrying
the
shouting
youngster
on
his
shoulders
at
that
instant
a
lady
appeared
in
the
doorway
leading
another
child
and
we
were
introduced
to
madame
gratiot
gentlemen
said
monsieur
gratiot
you
must
make
my
house
your
home
i
fear
your
visit
will
not
be
as
long
as
i
could
wish
ritchie
he
added
turning
to
me
if
wharton
correctly
states
your
business
i
have
an
engagement
to
have
my
furs
in
new
orleans
by
a
certain
time
i
am
late
in
loading
and
as
there
is
a
moon
i
am
sending
off
my
boats
night
the
men
will
have
to
work
on
we
were
fortunate
to
come
in
such
good
season
i
answered
after
a
delicious
supper
of
gumbo
a
creole
dish
of
fricassee
of
crême
brûlé
of
red
wine
and
fresh
wild
strawberries
we
sat
on
the
porch
the
crickets
chirped
in
the
garden
the
moon
cast
fantastic
shadows
from
the
pecan
tree
on
the
grass
while
nick
struggling
with
his
french
talked
to
madame
gratiot
and
now
and
then
their
gay
laughter
made
monsieur
gratiot
pause
and
smile
as
he
talked
to
me
of
my
errand
it
seemed
strange
to
me
that
a
man
who
had
lost
so
much
by
his
espousal
of
our
cause
should
still
be
faithful
to
the
american
republic
although
he
lived
in
louisiana
he
had
never
renounced
the
american
allegiance
which
he
had
taken
at
cahokia
he
regarded
with
no
favor
the
pretensions
of
spain
toward
kentucky
and
remarkably
enough
he
looked
forward
even
then
to
the
day
when
louisiana
would
belong
to
the
republic
i
exclaimed
at
this
mr
ritchie
said
he
the
most
casual
student
of
your
race
must
come
to
the
same
conclusion
you
have
seen
for
yourself
how
they
have
overrun
and
conquered
kentucky
and
the
cumberland
districts
despite
a
hideous
warfare
waged
by
all
the
tribes
your
people
will
not
be
denied
and
when
they
get
to
louisiana
they
will
take
it
as
they
take
everything
he
was
a
man
strong
in
argument
was
monsieur
gratiot
for
he
loved
it
and
he
beat
me
fairly
nay
he
said
finally
spain
might
as
well
try
to
dam
the
mississippi
as
to
dam
your
commerce
on
it
as
for
france
i
love
her
though
my
people
were
exiled
to
switzerland
by
the
edict
of
nantes
but
france
is
rotten
through
the
prodigality
of
her
kings
and
nobles
and
she
can
not
hold
louisiana
the
kingdom
is
sunk
in
he
cleared
his
throat
as
for
this
wilkinson
of
whom
you
speak
i
know
something
of
him
i
have
no
doubt
that
miro
pensions
him
but
i
know
miro
likewise
and
you
will
obtain
no
proof
of
that
you
will
however
discover
in
new
orleans
many
things
of
interest
to
your
government
and
to
the
federal
party
in
kentucky
colonel
chouteau
and
i
will
give
you
letters
to
certain
french
gentlemen
in
new
orleans
who
can
be
trusted
there
is
for
instance
who
puts
a
french
louisiana
into
his
prayers
he
has
never
forgiven
o
reilly
and
his
spaniards
for
the
murder
of
his
father
in
is
a
good
fellow
a
cousin
of
the
present
marquis
in
france
and
his
ancestors
held
many
positions
of
trust
in
the
colony
under
the
french
régime
he
entertains
lavishly
at
les
îles
his
plantation
on
the
mississippi
he
has
the
gossip
of
new
orleans
at
his
tongue

tip
and
you
will
be
suspected
of
nothing
save
a
desire
to
amuse
yourselves
if
you
go
he
paused
interrupted
by
the
laughter
of
the
others
when
strangers
of
note
or
of
position
drift
here
and
pass
on
to
new
orleans
i
always
give
them
letters
to
he
has
a
charming
daughter
and
a
worthless
monsieur
gratiot
produced
his
tabatière
and
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
i
summoned
my
courage
for
the
topic
which
had
trembled
all
the
evening
on
my
lips
some
years
ago
monsieur
gratiot
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
were
rescued
on
the
wilderness
trail
in
kentucky
they
left
us
for
louis
did
they
come
here
monsieur
gratiot
leaned
forward
quickly
they
were
people
of
quality
he
demanded
and
their
name
they
they
did
not
it
must
have
been
the
clives
he
cried
it
can
have
been
no
other
tell
me
a
woman
still
beautiful
commanding
of
perhaps
eight
and
thirty
a
woman
who
had
a
sorrow
a
great
sorrow
though
we
have
never
learned
it
and
clive
a
man
of
fashion
ill
content
too
and
pining
for
the
life
of
a
capital
yes
i
said
eagerly
my
voice
sinking
near
to
a
whisper
yes
it
is
they
and
are
they
here
monsieur
gratiot
took
another
pinch
of
snuff
it
seemed
an
age
before
he
answered
it
is
curious
that
you
should
mention
them
for
i
gave
them
letters
to
new
orleans
amongst
others
to
clive
was
what
shall
i
say
haunted
monsieur
clive
talked
of
nothing
but
paris
where
they
had
lived
once
and
at
last
she
gave
in
they
have
gone
to
paris
i
said
taking
breath
yes
it
is
more
than
a
year
ago
he
continued
seeming
not
to
notice
my
emotion
they
went
by
way
of
new
orleans
in
one
of
chouteau
s
boats
clive
seemed
a
woman
with
a
great

sunday
came
with
the
soft
haziness
of
a
june
morning
and
the
dew
sucked
a
fresh
fragrance
from
the
blossoms
and
the
grass
i
looked
out
of
our
window
at
the
orchard
all
pink
and
white
in
the
early
sun
and
across
a
patch
of
clover
to
the
stone
kitchen
a
pearly
feathery
smoke
was
wafted
from
the
chimney
a
delicious
aroma
of
creole
coffee
pervaded
the
odor
of
the
blossoms
and
a
negro
à
pieds
nus
came
down
the
path
with
two
steaming
cups
and
knocked
at
our
door
he
who
has
tasted
creole
coffee
will
never
forget
it
the
effect
of
it
was
lost
upon
nick
for
he
laid
down
the
cup
sighed
and
promptly
went
to
sleep
again
while
i
dressed
and
went
forth
to
make
his
excuses
to
the
family
i
found
monsieur
and
madame
with
their
children
walking
among
the
flowers
madame
laughed
he
is
charming
your
cousin
said
she
let
him
sleep
by
all
means
until
after
mass
then
you
must
come
with
us
to
madame
chouteau
s
my
mother
s
her
children
and
grandchildren
dine
with
her
every
madame
chouteau
my
is
the
queen
regent
of
louis
ritchie
said
monsieur
gratiot
gayly
we
are
all
afraid
of
her
and
i
warn
you
that
she
is
a
very
determined
and
formidable
personage
she
is
the
widow
of
the
founder
of
louis
the
sieur
laclède
although
she
prefers
her
own
name
she
rules
us
with
a
strong
hand
dispenses
justice
settles
disputes
and
sometimes
indulges
in
them
herself
it
is
her
you
will
see
a
very
pretty
french
custom
of
submission
to
parents
said
madame
gratiot
and
afterwards
there
is
a
a
ball
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
it
may
seem
very
strange
to
you
ritchie
but
we
believe
that
sunday
was
made
to
enjoy
they
will
have
time
to
attend
the
ball
before
you
send
them
down
the
river
she
added
mischievously
turning
to
her
husband
certainly
said
he
the
loading
will
not
be
finished
before
eight
o
presently
madame
gratiot
went
off
to
mass
while
i
walked
with
monsieur
gratiot
to
a
storehouse
near
the
river
s
bank
whence
the
skins
neatly
packed
and
numbered
were
being
carried
to
the
boats
on
the
sweating
shoulders
of
the
negroes
the
and
the
canadian
boatmen
bulky
bales
of
yellow
elk
from
the
upper
plains
of
the
missouri
of
buffalo
and
deer
and
bear
and
priceless
little
packages
of
the
otter
and
the
beaver
trapped
in
the
green
shade
of
the
endless
northern
forests
and
brought
hither
in
pirogues
down
the
swift
river
by
the
red
tribesmen
and
canadian
adventurers
afterwards
i
strolled
about
the
silent
village
even
the
cabarets
were
deserted
a
private
of
the
spanish
louisiana
regiment
in
a
dirty
uniform
slouched
behind
the
palings
in
front
of
the
commandant
s
quarters
a
quaint
stone
house
set
against
the
hill
with
dormer
windows
in
its
curving
roof
with
a
wide
porch
held
by
eight
sturdy
hewn
pillars
here
and
there
the
muffled
figure
of
a
prowling
indian
loitered
or
a
barefooted
negress
shuffled
along
by
the
fence
crooning
a
all
the
world
had
obeyed
the
call
of
the
church
bell
save
these
and
nick
i
bethought
myself
of
nick
and
made
my
way
back
to
monsieur
gratiot
s
i
found
my
cousin
railing
at
benjy
who
had
extracted
from
the
a
wondrous
gray
suit
of
london
cut
in
which
to
array
his
master
clothes
became
nick
s
slim
figure
remarkably
this
coat
was
cut
away
smartly
like
a
uniform
towards
the
tails
and
was
brought
in
at
the
waist
with
an
infinite
art
whither
now
my
conquistador
i
said
to
mass
said
he
to
mass
i
exclaimed
but
you
have
slept
through
the
greater
part
of
the
best
part
is
to
come
said
nick
giving
a
final
touch
to
his
followed
by
benjy
s
adoring
eyes
he
started
out
of
the
door
and
i
followed
him
perforce
we
came
to
the
little
church
of
upright
logs
and
plaster
with
its
crudely
shingled
peaked
roof
with
its
tiny
belfry
crowned
by
a
cross
with
its
porches
on
each
side
shading
the
line
of
windows
there
beside
the
church
a
little
at
the
back
was
the
curé
s
modest
house
of
stone
and
at
the
other
hand
under
spreading
trees
the
graveyard
with
its
rough
wooden
crosses
and
behind
these
graves
rose
the
wooded
hill
that
stretched
away
towards
the
wilderness
what
a
span
of
life
had
been
theirs
who
rested
here
their
youth
perchance
had
been
spent
amongst
the
crooked
streets
of
some
french
village
streets
lined
by
houses
and
crossing
limpid
streams
by
quaint
bridges
death
had
overtaken
them
beside
a
monster
tawny
river
of
which
their
imaginations
had
not
conceived
a
river
which
draws
tribute
from
the
remote
places
of
an
unknown
land
a
river
indeed
which
mixing
all
the
waters
seemed
to
symbolize
a
coming
race
which
was
to
conquer
the
land
by
its
resistless
flow
even
as
the
mississippi
bore
relentlessly
towards
the
sea
these
were
my
own
thoughts
as
i
listened
to
the
tones
of
the
priest
as
they
came
droningly
out
of
the
door
while
nick
was
exchanging
jokes
in
doubtful
french
with
some
leaning
against
the
palings
then
we
heard
benches
scraping
on
the
floor
and
the
congregation
began
to
file
out
those
who
reached
the
steps
gave
back
respectfully
and
there
came
an
elderly
lady
in
a
sober
turban
a
black
mantilla
wrapped
tightly
about
her
shoulders
and
i
made
no
doubt
that
she
was
monsieur
gratiot
s
madame
chouteau
she
whom
he
had
jestingly
called
the
queen
regent
i
was
sure
of
this
when
i
saw
madame
gratiot
behind
her
madame
chouteau
indeed
had
the
face
of
authority
a
nose
a
determined
chin
a
mouth
that
shut
tightly
madame
gratiot
presented
us
to
her
mother
and
as
she
passed
on
to
the
gate
madame
chouteau
reminded
us
that
we
were
to
dine
with
her
at
two
after
her
the
congregation
the
and
the
poor
alike
poured
out
of
the
church
and
spread
in
merry
groups
over
the
grass
keel
boatmen
in
tow
shirts
and
worsted
belts
the
blacksmith
the
shoemaker
the
farmer
of
a
small
plot
in
the
common
fields
in
large
cotton
pantaloons
and
camlet
coat
the
more
favored
in
linen
cotton
stockings
and
shoes
every
man
pausing
dipping
into
his
tabatière
for
a
word
with
his
neighbor
the
women
too
made
a
picture
strange
to
our
eyes
the
matrons
in
jacket
and
petticoat
a
madras
handkerchief
flung
about
their
shoulders
the
girls
in
fresh
cottonade
or
calamanco
all
at
once
cries
of
polyte
polyte
were
heard
and
a
nimble
young
man
with
a
face
hopped
around
the
corner
of
the
church
trundling
a
barrel
behind
polyte
came
two
rotund
little
men
perspiring
freely
and
laden
down
with
various
articles
a
with
two
yellow
birds
a
an
inlaid
card
box
a
roll
of
scarlet
cloth
and
i
know
not
what
else
they
deposited
these
on
the
grass
beside
the
barrel
which
polyte
had
set
on
end
and
proceeded
to
mount
encouraged
by
the
shouts
of
his
friends
who
pressed
around
the
barrel
it
s
an
auction
i
said
but
nick
did
not
hear
me
i
followed
his
glance
to
the
far
side
of
the
circle
and
my
eye
was
caught
by
a
red
ribbon
a
blush
that
matched
it
a
glance
shot
from
underneath
long
lashes
but
not
for
me
beside
the
girl
and
palpably
uneasy
stood
the
young
man
who
had
been
called
gaspard
ah
said
i
your
angel
of
the
but
nick
had
pulled
off
his
hat
and
was
sweeping
her
a
bow
the
girl
looked
down
smoothing
her
ribbon
gaspard
took
a
step
forward
and
other
young
women
near
us
tittered
with
delight
the
voice
of
hippolyte
rolling
his
r
s
called
out
in
a
french
dialect
m
ssieurs
et
mesdames
ce
sont
des
effets
d
un
pauvre
officier
qui
est
mort
who
will
buy
he
opened
the
produced
an
antiquated
beaver
with
a
gold
cord
and
surveyed
it
with
a
covetousness
that
was
admirably
feigned
for
polyte
was
an
actor
m
ssieurs
to
own
such
a
hat
were
a
patent
of
nobility
am
i
bid
twenty
livres
there
was
a
loud
laughter
and
he
was
bid
four
gaspard
cried
the
auctioneer
addressing
the
young
man
of
the
tumbrel
suzanne
would
no
longer
hesitate
if
she
saw
you
in
such
a
hat
and
with
the
trunk
too
ah
mon
dieu
can
you
afford
to
miss
it
the
crowd
howled
suzanne
simpered
and
gaspard
turned
as
pink
as
clover
but
he
was
not
to
be
bullied
the
hat
was
sold
to
an
elderly
person
the
red
cloth
likewise
a
pot
of
grease
went
to
a
housewife
and
there
was
a
veritable
scramble
for
the
box
of
playing
cards
and
at
last
hippolyte
held
up
the
wooden
cage
with
the
fluttering
yellow
birds
ha
he
cried
his
eyes
on
gaspard
once
more
a
gentle
present
a
present
to
make
a
heart
relent
and
monsieur
léon
perchance
you
will
make
a
bid
although
they
are
not
instantly
from
somewhere
under
the
barrel
a
cock
crew
even
the
yellow
birds
looked
surprised
and
as
for
polyte
he
nearly
dropped
the
cage
one
elderly
person
crossed
himself
i
looked
at
nick
his
face
was
impassive
but
suddenly
i
remembered
his
boyhood
gift
how
he
had
imitated
the
monkeys
and
i
began
to
shake
with
inward
laughter
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
peste
c
est
la
magie
said
an
old
man
at
last
searching
with
an
uncertain
hand
for
his
snuff
monsieur
cried
nick
to
the
auctioneer
i
will
make
a
bid
but
first
you
must
tell
me
whether
they
are
cocks
or
yellow
parbleu
answered
the
puzzled
hippolyte
that
i
do
not
know
everybody
looked
at
nick
including
suzanne
very
well
said
he
i
will
make
a
bid
and
if
they
turn
out
to
be
gamecocks
i
will
fight
them
with
monsieur
léon
behind
the
cabaret
two
livres
there
was
a
laugh
as
of
relief
three
cried
gaspard
and
his
voice
broke
hippolyte
looked
insulted
m
ssieurs
he
shouted
they
are
from
the
canaries
diable
un
berger
doit
être
another
laugh
and
gaspard
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
face
five
said
he
six
said
nick
and
the
villagers
turned
to
him
in
wonderment
what
could
such
a
fine
monsieur
want
with
two
yellow
birds
en
avant
gaspard
said
hippolyte
and
suzanne
shot
another
barbed
glance
in
our
direction
seven
muttered
gaspard
eight
said
nick
immediately
nine
said
gaspard
ten
said
nick
ten
cried
hippolyte
i
am
offered
ten
livres
for
the
yellow
birds
une
bagatelle
onze
gaspard
onze
onze
livres
pour
l
amour
de
suzanne
but
gaspard
was
silent
no
appeals
entreaties
or
taunts
could
persuade
him
to
bid
more
and
at
length
hippolyte
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
handed
nick
the
cage
as
though
he
were
giving
it
away
monsieur
he
said
the
birds
are
yours
since
there
are
no
more
lovers
who
are
worthy
of
the
name
they
do
not
monsieur
answered
nick
it
is
to
disprove
that
statement
that
i
have
bought
the
birds
mademoiselle
he
added
turning
to
the
flushing
suzanne
i
pray
that
you
will
accept
this
present
with
every
assurance
of
my
humble
mademoiselle
took
the
cage
and
amidst
the
laughter
of
the
village
at
the
discomfiture
of
poor
gaspard
swept
nick
a
frightened
courtesy
one
that
nevertheless
was
full
of
coquetry
and
at
that
instant
to
cap
the
situation
a
rotund
little
man
with
a
round
face
under
a
linen
biretta
grasped
nick
by
the
hand
and
cried
in
painful
but
sincere
english
monsieur
you

my
daughter
ver

she
want
those

and

to
see
you
at
the
pon
if
monsieur
will
lead
the
way
said
nick
instantly
taking
the
little
man
by
the
arm
but
you
are
to
dine
at
madame
chouteau
s
i
expostulated
to
be
sure
said
he
au

what

i
said
when
i
had
got
him
started
on
the
way
to
madame
chouteau
s
your
own
at
present
davy
he
answered
laying
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
else
i
should
be
on
the
way
to
the
pon
with
lenoir
but
the
ball
is
to
come
and
he
executed
several
steps
in
anticipation
davy
i
am
sorry
for
why
i
demanded
though
feeling
a
little
also
you
will
never
know
how
to
enjoy
yourself
said
he
with
conviction
madame
chouteau
lived
in
a
stone
house
wide
and
low
surrounded
by
trees
and
gardens
it
was
a
pretty
tribute
of
respect
her
children
and
grandchildren
paid
her
that
day
in
accordance
with
the
old
french
usage
of
honoring
the
parent
i
should
like
to
linger
on
the
scene
and
tell
how
nick
made
them
all
laugh
over
the
story
of
suzanne
lenoir
and
the
yellow
birds
and
how
the
children
pressed
around
him
and
made
him
imitate
all
the
denizens
of
wood
and
field
amid
deafening
shrieks
of
delight
you
have
probably
delayed
gaspard
s
wooing
another
year
temple
suzanne
is
a
sad
coquette
said
colonel
auguste
chouteau
laughing
as
we
set
out
for
the
ball
the
sun
was
hanging
low
over
the
western
hills
as
we
approached
the
barracks
and
out
of
the
open
windows
came
the
merry
mad
sounds
of
violin
guitar
and
flageolet
the
tinkle
of
a
triangle
now
and
then
the
shouts
of
laughter
the
shuffle
of
many
feet
over
the
puncheons
within
the
door
smiling
and
benignant
unmindful
of
the
stifling
atmosphere
sat
the
village
priest
talking
volubly
to
an
elderly
man
in
a
scarlet
cap
and
several
stout
ladies
ranged
along
the
wall
beyond
them
on
a
platform
zéron
the
baker
fiddled
as
though
his
life
depended
on
it
the
perspiration
dripping
from
his
brow
frowning
gesticulating
at
them
with
the
flageolet
and
the
triangle
and
in
a
dim
noisy
heated
whirl
the
whole
village
went
round
and
round
and
round
under
the
low
ceiling
in
the
valse
young
and
old
rich
and
poor
high
and
low
the
sound
of
their
laughter
and
the
scraping
of
their
feet
cut
now
and
again
by
an
agonized
squeak
from
zéron
s
fiddle
from
time
to
time
a
staggering
panting
couple
would
fling
themselves
out
help
themselves
liberally
to
pink
sirop
from
the
bowl
on
the
side
table
and
then
fling
themselves
in
once
more
until
zéron
stopped
from
sheer
exhaustion
to
tune
up
for
a
pas
de
deux
across
the
room
by
the
sirop
bowl
a
pair
of
red
ribbons
flaunted
a
pair
of
eyes
sent
a
swift
challenge
zéron
and
his
assistants
struck
up
again
and
there
in
a
corner
was
nick
temple
with
characteristic
effrontery
attempting
a
pas
de
deux
with
suzanne
though
nick
was
ignorant
he
was
not
ungraceful
and
the
village
laughed
and
admired
and
when
zéron
drifted
back
into
a
valse
he
seized
suzanne
s
plump
figure
in
his
arms
and
bore
her
unresisting
like
a
prize
among
the
dancers
avoiding
alike
the
fat
and
unwieldy
the
clumsy
and
the
spiteful
for
a
while
the
tune
held
its
mad
pace
and
ended
with
a
shriek
and
a
snap
on
a
high
note
for
zéron
had
broken
a
string
amid
a
burst
of
laughter
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
i
saw
nick
stop
before
an
open
window
in
which
a
prying
indian
was
framed
swing
suzanne
at
arm
s
length
and
bow
abruptly
at
the
brave
with
a
grunt
that
startled
him
into
life
en
méchant
shrieked
suzanne
excitedly
poor
gaspard
poor
hippolyte
they
would
gain
suzanne
for
a
dance
only
to
have
her
snatched
away
at
the
next
by
the
slim
and
reckless
young
gentleman
in
the
gray
court
clothes
little
nick
cared
that
the
affair
soon
became
the
amusement
of
the
company
from
time
to
time
as
he
glided
past
with
suzanne
on
his
shoulder
he
nodded
gayly
to
colonel
chouteau
or
made
a
long
face
at
me
and
to
save
our
souls
we
could
not
help
laughing
the
girl
has
met
her
match
for
she
has
played
with
all
the
hearts
in
the
village
said
monsieur
chouteau
but
perhaps
it
is
just
as
well
that
temple
is
leaving
i
have
signed
a
bon
ritchie
by
which
you
can
obtain
money
at
new
orleans
and
do
not
forget
to
present
our
letter
to
monsieur
de
saint
gré
he
has
a
daughter
by
the
way
who
will
be
more
of
a
match
for
your
friend
s
fascinations
than
the
evening
faded
into
twilight
with
no
signs
of
weariness
from
the
dancers
and
presently
there
stood
beside
us
jean
baptiste
lenoir
the
colonel
s
miller
b
soir
monsieur
le
colonel
he
said
touching
his
the
water
is
very
low
you
fren
he
added
turning
to
me
he
stay
long
time
in
louis
he
is
going
away
in
an
hour
or
so
i
answered
with
thanksgiving
in
my
heart
i
am
sorry
said
monsieur
lenoir
politely
but
his
looks
belied
his
words
he
is
ver
fond
suzanne
he
marry
her
but
i
think
not
i
come
away
from
france
to
escape
the
fine
gentlemen
long
time
ago
they
want
to
run
off
with
my
wife
she
was
like
how
long
ago
did
you
come
from
france
monsieur
i
asked
to
get
away
from
an
uncomfortable
subject
it
is
twenty
years
said
he
dreamily
in
french
i
was
born
in
the
quartier
saint
jean
on
the
harbor
of
the
city
of
marseilles
near
notre
dame
de
la
and
he
told
of
a
tall
uneven
house
of
four
stories
with
a
high
pitched
roof
and
a
little
barred
door
and
window
at
the
bottom
giving
out
upon
the
rough
cobbles
he
spoke
of
the
smell
of
the
sea
of
the
rollicking
sailors
who
surged
through
the
narrow
street
to
embark
on
his
majesty
s
and
of
the
king
s
white
soldiers
in
ranks
of
four
going
to
foreign
lands
and
how
he
had
become
a
farmer
the
tenant
of
a
country
family
excitement
grew
on
him
and
he
mopped
his
brow
with
his
blue
rumal
handkerchief
they
desire
all
the
nobles
he
cried
i
make
the
land
good
and
they
seize
it
i
marry
a
pretty
wife
and
monsieur
le
comte
he
want
her
l
bon
dieu
he
added
bitterly
relapsing
into
french
france
is
for
the
king
and
the
nobility
monsieur
the
poor
have
but
little
chance
there
in
the
country
i
have
seen
the
peasants
eat
roots
and
in
the
city
the
poor
devour
the
refuse
from
the
houses
of
the
rich
it
was
we
who
paid
for
their
luxuries
and
with
mine
own
eyes
i
have
seen
their
gilded
coaches
ride
down
weak
men
and
women
in
the
streets
but
it
can
not
last
they
will
murder
louis
and
burn
the
great
châteaux
i
who
speak
to
you
am
of
the
people
monsieur
i
know
the
sun
had
long
set
and
with
flint
and
tow
they
were
touching
the
flame
to
the
candles
which
flickered
transparent
yellow
in
the
deepening
twilight
so
absorbed
had
i
become
in
listening
to
lenoir
s
description
that
i
had
forgotten
nick
now
i
searched
for
him
among
the
promenading
figures
and
missed
him
in
vain
did
i
seek
for
a
glimpse
of
suzanne
s
red
ribbons
and
i
grew
less
and
less
attentive
to
the
miller
s
reminiscences
and
arraignments
of
the
nobility
had
nick
indeed
run
away
with
his
daughter
the
dancing
went
on
with
unabated
zeal
and
through
the
open
door
in
the
fainting
azure
of
the
sky
the
summer
moon
hung
above
the
hills
like
a
great
yellow
orange
striving
to
hide
my
uneasiness
i
made
my
farewells
to
madame
chouteau
s
sons
and
daughters
and
their
friends
and
with
colonel
chouteau
i
left
the
hall
and
began
to
walk
towards
monsieur
gratiot
s
hoping
against
hope
that
nick
had
gone
there
to
change
but
we
had
scarce
reached
the
road
before
we
could
see
two
figures
in
the
distance
hazily
outlined
in
the
of
the
departed
sun
and
the
coming
moon
the
first
was
monsieur
gratiot
himself
the
second
benjy
monsieur
gratiot
took
me
by
the
hand
i
regret
to
inform
you
ritchie
said
he
politely
that
my
keel
boats
are
loaded
and
ready
to
leave
were
you
on
any
other
errand
i
should
implore
you
to
stay
with
is
temple
at
your
house
i
asked
faintly
why
no
said
monsieur
gratiot
i
thought
he
was
with
you
at
the
where
is
your
master
i
demanded
sternly
of
benjy
i
ain
t
seed
him
marse
dave
sence
i
put
him
inter
dem
fine
clothes
at
he
w
ars
tin
he
has
gone
off
with
the
girl
put
in
colonel
chouteau
laughing
but
where
i
said
with
growing
anger
at
this
lack
of
consideration
on
nick
s
part
i
ll
warrant
that
gaspard
or
hippolyte
beaujais
will
know
if
they
can
be
found
said
the
colonel
neither
of
them
willingly
lets
the
girl
out
of
his
as
we
hurried
back
towards
the
throbbing
sounds
of
zéron
s
fiddle
i
apologized
as
best
i
might
to
monsieur
gratiot
declaring
that
if
nick
were
not
found
within
the
i
would
leave
without
him
my
host
protested
that
an
hour
or
so
would
make
no
difference
we
were
about
to
pass
through
the
group
of
loungers
that
loitered
by
the
gate
when
the
sound
of
rapid
footsteps
arrested
us
and
we
turned
to
confront
two
panting
and
perspiring
young
men
who
halted
beside
us
one
was
hippolyte
beaujais
more
fantastic
than
ever
as
he
faced
the
moon
and
the
other
was
gaspard
they
had
plainly
made
a
common
cause
but
it
was
hippolyte
who
spoke
monsieur
he
cried
you
seek
your
friend
ha
we
have
found
him
we
will
lead
you
to
where
is
he
said
colonel
chouteau
repressing
another
laugh
on
the
pond
monsieur
in
a
boat
monsieur
with
suzanne
monsieur
le
colonel
and
moreover
he
will
come
ashore
for
no
parbleu
said
the
colonel
i
should
think
not
for
any
arguments
that
you
two
could
muster
but
we
will
go
how
far
is
it
i
asked
thinking
of
monsieur
gratiot
about
a
mile
said
colonel
chouteau
a
pleasant
we
stepped
out
hippolyte
and
gaspard
running
in
front
the
colonel
and
monsieur
gratiot
and
myself
following
and
a
snicker
which
burst
out
now
and
then
told
us
that
benjy
was
in
the
rear
on
any
other
errand
i
should
have
thought
the
way
beautiful
for
the
country
road
rutted
by
wooden
wheels
wound
in
and
out
through
pleasant
vales
and
over
gentle
rises
whence
we
caught
glimpses
from
time
to
time
of
the
mississippi
gleaming
like
molten
gold
to
the
eastward
here
and
there
nestling
against
the
gentle
slopes
of
the
hillside
clearing
was
a
farmhouse
among
its
orchards
as
we
walked
nick
s
escapade
instead
of
angering
monsieur
gratiot
seemed
to
present
itself
to
him
in
a
more
and
more
ridiculous
aspect
and
twice
he
nudged
me
to
call
my
attention
to
the
two
vengefully
triumphant
figures
silhouetted
against
the
moon
ahead
of
us
from
time
to
time
also
i
saw
colonel
chouteau
shaking
with
laughter
as
for
me
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
at
nick
for
any
space
nobody
else
would
have
carried
off
a
girl
in
the
face
of
her
rivals
for
a
moonlight
row
on
a
pond
a
mile
away
at
length
we
began
to
go
down
into
the
valley
where
chouteau
s
pond
was
and
we
caught
glimpses
of
the
shimmering
of
its
waters
through
the
trees
ay
and
presently
heard
them
tumbling
lightly
over
the
the
spot
was
made
for
romance
a
sequestered
vale
clad
with
forest
trees
cleared
a
little
by
the
where
monsieur
lenoir
raised
his
maize
and
his
vegetables
below
the
mill
so
monsieur
gratiot
told
me
where
the
creek
lay
in
pools
on
its
limestone
bed
the
village
washing
was
done
and
every
monday
morning
negresses
strode
up
this
road
the
bundles
of
clothes
balanced
on
their
heads
the
paddles
in
their
hands
followed
by
a
stream
of
black
urchins
who
tempted
providence
to
drown
them
down
in
the
valley
we
came
to
a
path
that
branched
from
the
road
and
led
under
the
oaks
and
hickories
towards
the
pond
and
we
had
not
taken
twenty
paces
in
it
before
the
notes
of
a
guitar
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
reached
our
ears
and
then
when
the
six
of
us
stood
huddled
in
the
rank
growth
at
the
water
s
edge
we
saw
a
boat
floating
idly
in
the
forest
shadow
on
the
far
side
i
put
my
hand
to
my
mouth
nick
i
shouted
there
came
for
an
answer
with
the
careless
and
unskilful
thrumming
of
the
guitar
the
end
of
the
verse
thine
eyes
are
bright
as
the
stars
at
night
thy
cheeks
like
the
rose
of
the
dawning
oh
hélas
exclaimed
hippolyte
sadly
there
is
no
other
nick
i
shouted
again
reënforced
vociferously
by
the
others
the
music
ceased
there
came
feminine
laughter
across
the
water
then
nick
s
voice
in
french
that
dared
everything
go
away
and
amuse
yourselves
at
the
dance
peste
it
is
scarce
an
hour
ago
i
threatened
to
row
ashore
and
break
your
heads
allez
vous
en
jaloux
a
scream
of
delight
from
suzanne
followed
this
sally
which
was
received
by
gaspard
and
hippolyte
with
a
rattle
of
sacrés
and
despite
our
irritation
the
colonel
monsieur
gratiot
and
myself
with
a
burst
of
involuntary
laughter
parbleu
said
the
colonel
choking
it
is
a
pity
to
disturb
such
a
one
gratiot
if
it
was
my
boat
i
d
delay
the
departure
till
indeed
i
shall
have
had
no
small
entertainment
as
a
solace
said
monsieur
gratiot
listen
the
tinkle
of
the
guitar
was
heard
again
and
nick
s
voice
strong
and
full
and
undisturbed
s
posin
i
was
to
go
to
n
o
leans
an
take
sick
an
die
like
a
bird
into
the
country
my
spirit
would
fly
go
way
old
man
and
leave
me
alone
for
i
am
a
stranger
and
a
long
way
from
there
was
a
murmur
of
voices
in
the
boat
the
sound
of
a
paddle
gurgling
as
it
dipped
and
the
dugout
shot
out
towards
the
middle
of
the
pond
and
drifted
again
i
shouted
once
more
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
come
in
here
nick
instantly
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
by
gad
it
s
parson
davy
i
heard
nick
exclaim
halloo
davy
how
the
deuce
did
you
get
there
no
thanks
to
you
i
retorted
hotly
come
lord
said
he
is
it
time
to
go
to
new
orleans
one
might
think
new
orleans
was
across
the
street
said
monsieur
gratiot
what
an
attitude
of
mind
the
dugout
was
coming
towards
us
now
propelled
by
easy
strokes
and
nick
could
be
heard
the
while
talking
in
low
tones
to
suzanne
we
could
only
guess
at
the
tenor
of
his
conversation
which
ceased
entirely
as
they
drew
near
at
length
the
prow
slid
in
among
the
rushes
was
seized
vigorously
by
gaspard
and
hippolyte
and
the
boat
hauled
ashore
thank
you
very
much
messieurs
you
are
most
obliging
said
nick
and
taking
suzanne
by
the
hand
he
helped
her
gallantly
over
the
gunwale
monsieur
he
added
turning
in
his
most
irresistible
manner
to
monsieur
gratiot
if
i
have
delayed
the
departure
of
your
boat
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
but
i
appeal
to
you
if
i
have
not
the
best
of
and
he
bowed
to
suzanne
who
stood
beside
him
coyly
looking
down
as
for
polyte
and
gaspard
they
were
quite
breathless
between
rage
and
astonishment
but
colonel
chouteau
began
to
laugh
diable
monsieur
you
are
right
he
cried
and
rather
than
have
missed
this
entertainment
i
would
pay
gratiot
for
his
au
revoir
mademoiselle
said
nick
i
will
return
when
i
am
released
from
bondage
when
this
terrible
mentor
relaxes
vigilance
i
will
escape
and
make
my
way
back
to
you
through
the
oh
cried
mademoiselle
to
me
you
will
let
him
come
back
assuredly
mademoiselle
i
said
but
i
have
known
him
longer
than
you
and
i
tell
you
that
in
a
month
he
will
not
wish
to
come
hippolyte
gave
a
grunt
of
approval
to
this
plain
speech
suzanne
exclaimed
but
before
nick
could
answer
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
path
and
lenoir
himself
perspiring
panting
exhausted
appeared
in
the
midst
of
us
suzanne
he
cried
suzanne
and
turning
to
nick
he
added
quite
simply
so
monsieur
you
did
not
run
off
with
her
after
all
there
was
no
place
to
run
monsieur
answered
nick
praise
be
to
god
for
that
said
the
miller
heartily
there
is
some
advantage
in
living
in
the
wilderness
when
everything
is
i
shall
come
back
and
try
monsieur
said
nick
the
miller
raised
his
hands
i
assure
you
that
he
will
not
monsieur
i
put
in
he
thanked
me
profusely
and
suddenly
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
there
is
the
priest
he
cried
monsieur
le
curé
retires
late
there
is
the
priest
there
was
an
awkward
silence
broken
at
length
by
an
exclamation
from
gaspard
colonel
chouteau
turned
his
back
and
i
saw
his
shoulders
heave
all
eyes
were
on
nick
but
the
rascal
did
not
seem
at
all
perturbed
monsieur
he
said
bowing
marriage
is
a
serious
thing
and
not
to
be
entered
into
lightly
i
thank
you
from
my
heart
but
i
am
bound
now
with
ritchie
on
an
errand
of
such
importance
that
i
must
make
a
sacrifice
of
my
own
interests
and
affairs
to
if
temple
wishes
i
began
with
malicious
delight
but
nick
took
me
by
the
shoulder
my
dear
davy
he
said
giving
me
a
vicious
kick
i
could
not
think
of
it
i
will
go
with
you
at
once
adieu
mademoiselle
said
he
bending
over
suzanne
s
unresisting
hand
adieu
messieurs
and
i
thank
you
for
your
great
interest
in
this
to
gaspard
and
hippolyte
and
now
monsieur
gratiot
i
have
already
presumed
too
much
on
your
patience
i
will
follow
you
we
left
them
lenoir
suzanne
and
her
two
suitors
standing
at
the
pond
and
made
our
way
through
the
path
in
the
forest
it
was
not
until
we
reached
the
road
and
had
begun
to
climb
out
of
the
valley
that
the
silence
was
broken
between
us
monsieur
said
colonel
chouteau
slyly
do
you
have
many
such
escapes
it
might
have
been
closer
said
nick
closer
ejaculated
the
colonel
assuredly
said
nick
to
the
extent
of
abducting
monsieur
le
curé
as
for
you
davy
he
added
between
his
teeth
i
mean
to
get
even
with
it
was
well
for
us
that
the
colonel
and
monsieur
gratiot
took
the
escapade
with
such
good
nature
and
so
we
walked
along
through
the
summer
night
talking
gayly
until
at
length
the
lights
of
the
village
twinkled
ahead
of
us
and
in
the
streets
we
met
many
parties
making
merry
on
their
homeward
way
we
came
to
monsieur
gratiot
s
bade
our
farewells
to
madame
picked
up
our
the
two
gentlemen
escorting
us
down
to
the
river
bank
where
the
keel
boat
was
tugging
at
the
ropes
that
held
her
impatient
to
be
off
her
captain
a
picturesque
canadian
by
the
name
of
xavier
paret
was
presented
to
us
we
bade
our
friends
farewell
and
stepped
across
the
plank
to
the
deck
as
we
were
casting
off
monsieur
gratiot
called
to
us
that
he
would
take
the
first
occasion
to
send
our
horses
back
to
kentucky
the
oars
were
manned
the
heavy
hulk
moved
and
we
were
shot
out
into
the
mighty
current
of
the
river
on
our
way
to
new
orleans
nick
and
i
stood
for
a
long
time
on
the
deck
and
the
windows
of
the
little
village
gleamed
like
stars
among
the
trees
we
passed
the
last
of
its
houses
that
nestled
against
the
hill
and
below
that
the
forest
lay
like
velvet
under
the
moon
the
song
of
our
boatmen
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
voici
le
temps
et
la

chapter
x
the
keel
boat
we
were
embarked
on
a
strange
river
in
a
strange
boat
and
bound
for
a
strange
city
to
us
westerners
a
halo
of
romance
of
unreality
hung
over
new
orleans
to
us
it
had
an
old
world
almost
oriental
flavor
of
mystery
and
luxury
and
pleasure
and
we
imagined
it
swathed
in
the
moisture
of
the
delta
built
of
quaint
houses
with
courts
of
shining
orange
trees
and
magnolias
and
surrounded
by
flowering
plantations
of
unimagined
beauty
it
was
most
fitting
that
such
a
place
should
be
the
seat
of
dark
intrigues
against
material
progress
and
this
notion
lent
added
zest
to
my
errand
thither
as
for
nick
it
took
no
great
sagacity
on
my
part
to
predict
that
he
would
forget
suzanne
and
begin
to
look
forward
to
the
creole
beauties
of
the
mysterious
city
first
there
was
the
keel
boat
in
which
we
travelled
gone
forever
now
from
western
navigation
it
had
its
rude
square
sail
to
take
advantage
of
the
river
winds
its
mast
strongly
braced
to
hold
the
long
but
were
for
the
endless
journey
when
a
numerous
crew
strained
day
after
day
along
the
bank
chanting
the
voyageurs
songs
now
we
were
two
and
two
canadians
to
handle
the
oars
in
time
of
peril
and
captain
xavier
who
stood
aft
on
the
cabin
roof
leaning
against
the
heavy
beam
of
the
long
curved
tiller
watching
hawklike
for
snag
and
eddy
and
bar
within
the
cabin
was
a
great
fireplace
of
stones
where
our
cooking
was
done
and
bunks
set
round
for
the
men
in
cold
weather
and
rainy
but
in
these
fair
nights
we
chose
to
sleep
on
deck
far
into
the
night
we
sat
nick
and
i
our
feet
dangling
over
the
forward
edge
of
the
cabin
looking
at
the
glory
of
the
moon
on
the
vast
river
at
the
endless
forest
crown
at
the
haze
which
hung
like
silver
dust
under
the
high
bluffs
on
the
american
side
we
slept
we
awoke
again
as
the
moon
was
shrinking
abashed
before
the
light
that
glowed
above
these
cliffs
and
the
river
was
turned
from
brown
to
gold
and
then
to
burnished
copper
the
forest
to
a
thousand
shades
of
green
from
crest
to
the
banks
where
the
river
was
licking
the
twisted
roots
to
nakedness
the
south
wind
wafted
the
sharp
from
the
chimney
across
our
faces
in
the
stern
xavier
stood
immovable
against
the
tiller
his
short
pipe
clutched
between
his
teeth
the
colors
of
his
new
worsted
belt
made
gorgeous
by
the
rising
sun
b
jour
michié
he
said
and
added
in
the
english
he
had
picked
up
from
the
british
traders
the
breakfas
he
is
ready
and
jean
make
him
good
will
you
have
the
grace
to
descen
we
went
down
the
ladder
into
the
cabin
where
the
odor
of
the
furs
mingled
with
the
smell
of
the
cooking
there
was
a
fricassee
steaming
on
the
crane
some
of
zéron
s
bread
brought
from
louis
and
coffee
that
monsieur
gratiot
had
provided
for
our
use
we
took
our
bowls
and
cups
on
deck
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
cabin
by
gad
cried
nick
it
lacks
but
the
one
element
to
make
it
a
and
what
is
that
i
demanded
a
woman
said
he
xavier
who
overheard
gave
a
delighted
laugh
parbleu
michié
you
have
right
he
said
but
michié
gratiot
he
say
no
in
nouvelle
orléans
we
find
nick
got
to
his
feet
and
if
anything
he
did
could
have
surprised
me
i
should
have
been
surprised
when
he
put
his
arm
coaxingly
about
xavier
s
neck
xavier
himself
was
surprised
and
correspondingly
delighted
tell
me
xavier
he
said
with
a
look
not
to
be
resisted
do
you
think
i
shall
find
some
beauties
there

exclaimed
xavier
la

it

they
promenade
themselves
on

they
look
down

xavier

they

there

the
father
and
the

and
the
and
xavier
who
had
a
wen
under
his
eye
laid
his
finger
on
it
for
shame
xavier
cried
nick
and
you
are
balked
by
such
things
xavier
thought
this
an
exceedingly
good
joke
and
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
laugh
the
better
me
mais
non
michié
and
yet
ze
alcalde
he
mek
me
afraid
once
he
put
me
in
ze
calaboose
when
i
tried
to
climb
ze
balcon
nick
roared
i
will
show
you
how
xavier
he
said
as
to
climbing
the
balconies
there
is
a
convenance
in
it
as
in
all
else
for
instance
one
must
be
daring
and
discreet
and
nimble
and
ready
to
give
the
law
a
presentable
answer
and
lacking
that
a
piastre
and
then
the
fair
one
must
be
a
fair
one
diable

cried
xavier
you

ze
nay
said
nick
i
learned
it
all
and
much
more
from
my
cousin
xavier
stared
at
me
for
an
instant
and
considering
that
he
knew
nothing
of
my
character
i
thought
it
extremely
impolite
of
him
to
laugh
indeed
he
tried
to
control
himself
for
some
reason
standing
in
awe
of
my
appearance
and
then
he
burst
out
into
such
loud
that
the
crew
poked
their
heads
above
the
cabin
hatch
michié
reetchie
said
xavier
and
again
he
burst
into
laughter
that
choked
further
speech
he
controlled
himself
and
laid
his
finger
on
his
wen
you
don
t
believe

said
nick
offended

xavier

xavier
roared
again

said
xavier
said

gently
taking
the
tiller
out
of
his
hand
i

xavier
and

xavier
twined

around

xavier
said
nick
pushing

away
i

the
xavier
laughed
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
cabin
nick
took
easily
to
accomplishments
and
he
handled
the
clumsy
tiller
with
a
certainty
and
distinction
that
made
the
boatmen
swear
in
two
languages
and
a
patois
a
great
giant
of
the
northern
forests
loomed
ahead
of
us
xavier
sprang
to
his
feet
but
nick
had
swung
his
boat
swiftly
smoothly
into
the
deeper
water
on
the
outer
side
saint
jacques
michié
cried
xavier
you
mek
him
better
zan
i
fascinated
by
a
new
accomplishment
nick
held
to
the
tiller
while
xavier
with
a
trained
eye
scanned
the
troubled
surface
of
the
river
ahead
the
wind
died
the
sun
beat
down
with
a
moist
and
venomous
sting
and
northeastward
above
the
edge
of
the
bluff
a
bank
of
cloud
like
sulphur
smoke
was
lifted
gradually
xavier
ceased
his
jesting
and
became
quiet
looks
like
a
hurricane
said
nick
mon
dieu
said
xavier
you
have
right
michié
and
he
called
in
his
rapid
patois
to
the
crew
who
lounged
forward
in
the
cabin
s
shade
there
came
to
my
mind
the
memory
of
that
hurricane
at
temple
bow
long
ago
a
storm
that
seemed
to
have
brought
so
much
sorrow
into
my
life
i
glanced
at
nick
but
his
face
was
serene
the
came
on
in
black
and
yellow
masses
and
the
saffron
light
i
recalled
so
well
turned
the
living
green
of
the
forest
to
a
sickly
pallor
and
the
yellow
river
to
a
tinge
scarce
to
be
matched
on
earth
xavier
had
the
tiller
now
and
the
men
were
straining
at
the
oars
to
send
the
boat
across
the
current
towards
the
nearer
western
shore
and
as
my
glance
took
in
the
scale
of
things
the
miles
of
bluff
frowning
above
the
bottom
the
river
that
seemed
now
like
a
lake
of
lava
gently
boiling
and
the
wilderness
of
the
western
shore
that
reached
beyond
the
ken
of
man
i
could
not
but
shudder
to
think
of
the
conflict
of
nature
s
forces
in
such
a
place
a
grim
stillness
reigned
over
all
broken
only
now
and
again
by
a
sharp
command
from
xavier
the
men
were
rowing
for
their
lives
the
sweat
glistening
on
their
red
faces
she
come
said
xavier
i
looked
not
to
the
northeast
whence
the
banks
of
cloud
had
risen
but
to
the
southwest
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
little
speck
was
there
against
the
hurrying
film
of
cloud
we
were
drawing
near
the
forest
line
where
a
little
creek
made
an
indentation
i
listened
and
from
afar
came
a
sound
like
the
strumming
of
low
notes
on
a
guitar
and
sad
the
terrified
scream
of
a
panther
broke
the
silence
of
the
forest
and
then
the
other
distant
note
grew
stronger
and
stronger
yet
and
rose
to
a
high
hum
like
unto
no
sound
on
this
earth
and
mingled
with
it
now
was
a
lashing
like
water
falling
from
a
great
height
we
grounded
and
xavier
seizing
a
great
leaped
into
the
shallow
water
and
passed
the
bight
around
a
trunk
i
cried
out
to
nick
but
my
voice
was
drowned
he
seized
me
and
flung
me
under
the
cabin
s
lee
and
then
above
the
fearful
note
of
the
storm
came
cracklings
like
gunshots
of
great
trees
snapping
at
their
trunk
we
saw
the
forest
wall
burst
out
how
far
away
i
know
not
and
the
air
was
filled
as
with
a
flock
of
giant
birds
and
boughs
crashed
on
the
roof
of
the
cabin
and
tore
the
water
in
the
darkness
how
long
we
lay
clutching
each
other
in
terror
on
the
rocking
boat
i
may
not
say
but
when
the
veil
first
lifted
there
was
the
river
like
an
angry
sea
and
limitless
the
wind
in
its
fury
whipping
the
foam
from
the
crests
and
bearing
it
off
into
space
and
presently
as
we
stared
the
note
lowered
and
the
wind
was
gone
again
and
there
was
the
water
tossing
foolishly
and
we
lay
safe
amidst
the
green
wreckage
of
the
forest
as
by
a
miracle
it
was
nick
who
moved
first
with
white
face
he
climbed
to
the
roof
of
the
cabin
and
idly
seizing
the
great
limb
that
lay
there
tried
to
move
it
xavier
who
lay
on
his
face
on
the
bank
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
and
crossed
himself
beyond
me
crowded
the
four
members
of
the
crew
unhurt
then
we
heard
xavier
s
voice
in
french
thanking
the
blessed
virgin
for
our
escape
further
speech
was
gone
from
us
for
men
do
not
talk
after
such
a
matter
we
laid
hold
of
the
tree
across
the
cabin
and
straining
flung
it
over
into
the
water
a
great
drop
of
rain
hit
me
on
the
forehead
and
there
came
a
downpour
that
blotted
out
the
scene
and
drove
us
down
below
and
then
from
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
cabin
came
a
sound
to
make
a
man
s
blood
run
cold
what
s
that
i
said
clutching
nick
benjy
said
he
thank
god
he
did
not
die
of
we
lighted
a
candle
and
poking
around
found
the
negro
where
he
had
crept
into
the
farthest
corner
of
a
bunk
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
when
we
touched
him
he
gave
vent
to
a
yell
that
was
i
se
a
bad
nigger
lo
d
yes
i
is
he
moaned
i
ain

shook
him
and
laughed
come
out
of
that
benjy
he
said
you

got
another
benjy
turned
perforce
the
whites
of
his
eyes
gleaming
in

and

said
benjy
nick
hauled
him
out
on
the
floor
climbing
to
the
deck
we
found
that
the
boat
was
already
under
way
running
southward
in
the
current
through
the
misty
rain
and
gazing
shoreward
a
sight
met
my
eyes
which
i
shall
never
forget
a
wide
vista
carpeted
with
wreckage
was
cut
through
the
forest
to
the
river
s
edge
and
the
yellow
water
was
strewn
for
miles
with
green
boughs
we
stared
down
it
overwhelmed
until
we
had
passed
beyond
its
line
it
is
as
straight
said
nick
as
straight
as
one
of
her
majesty
s
alleys
i
saw
cut
through
the
forest
at
had
i
space
and
time
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
this
journey
it
would
be
chiefly
a
tribute
to
xavier
s
skill
for
they
who
have
not
put
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
mississippi
in
a
small
craft
can
have
no
idea
of
the
dangers
of
such
a
voyage
infinite
experience
a
keen
eye
a
steady
hand
and
a
nerve
of
iron
are
required
now
when
the
current
swirled
almost
to
a
rapid
we
grazed
a
rock
by
the
width
of
a
ripple
and
again
despite
the
effort
of
xavier
and
the
crew
we
would
tear
the
limbs
from
a
huge
tree
which
had
we
hit
it
fair
would
have
ripped
us
from
bow
to
stern
once
indeed
we
were
fast
on
a
whence
as
nick
said
xavier
fairly
cursed
us
off
we
took
care
to
moor
at
night
where
we
could
be
seen
as
little
as
possible
from
the
river
and
divided
the
watches
lest
we
should
be
surprised
by
indians
and
as
we
went
southward
our
hands
and
faces
became
blotched
all
over
by
the
bites
of
mosquitoes
and
flies
and
we
smothered
ourselves
under
blankets
to
get
rid
of
them
at
times
we
fished
and
one
evening
after
we
had
passed
the
expanse
of
water
at
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
nick
pulled
a
hideous
thing
from
the
inscrutable
yellow
depths
a
slimy
scaleless
catfish
he
came
up
like
a
log
and
must
have
weighed
seventy
pounds
xavier
and
his
men
and
myself
made
two
good
meals
of
him
but
nick
would
not
touch
the
meat
the
great
river
teemed
with
life
there
were
flocks
of
herons
and
cranes
and
water
pelicans
and
i
know
not
what
other
birds
and
as
we
slipped
under
the
banks
we
often
heard
the
paroquets
chattering
in
the
forests
and
once
as
we
drifted
into
an
inlet
at
sunset
we
caught
sight
of
the
shaggy
head
of
a
bear
above
the
brown
water
and
leaping
down
into
the
cabin
i
primed
the
rifle
that
stood
there
and
shot
him
it
took
the
seven
of
us
to
drag
him
on
board
and
then
i
cleaned
and
skinned
him
as
tom
had
taught
me
and
showed
jean
how
to
put
the
caul
fat
and
liver
in
rows
on
a
skewer
and
wrap
it
in
the
bear
s
handkerchief
and
roast
it
before
the
fire
nick
found
no
difficulty
in
eating
this
it
was
a
dish
fit
for
any
gourmand
we
passed
the
great
red
chickasaw
bluff
which
sits
facing
westward
looking
over
the
limitless
louisiana
forests
where
new
and
wondrous
vines
and
flowers
grew
and
came
to
the
beautiful
walnut
hills
crowned
by
a
spanish
fort
we
did
not
stop
there
to
exchange
courtesies
but
pressed
on
to
the
grand
gulf
the
grave
of
many
a
keel
boat
before
and
since
this
was
by
far
the
most
dangerous
place
on
the
mississippi
and
xavier
was
never
weary
of
recounting
many
perilous
escapes
there
or
telling
how
such
and
such
a
priceless
cargo
had
sunk
in
the
mud
by
reason
of
the
lack
of
skill
of
particular
boatmen
he
knew
of
and
indeed
the
canadian
s
face
assumed
a
graver
mien
after
the
walnut
hills
were
behind
us
you
laugh
michié
he
said
to
nick
a
little
resentfully
i
who
speak
to
you
say
that
there
is
four
foot
on
each
side
of
ze
bateau
too
much
tafia
a
little
too
much
excite
and
he
made
a
gesture
with
his
hand
expressive
of
total
destruction
ze
tornado
i
would
sooner
have
him
bah
said
nick
stroking
xavier
s
black
beard
give
me
the
tiller
i
will
see
you
through
safely
and
we
will
not
spare
the
tafia
and
he
began
to
sing
a
song
of
xavier
s
own
marianson
dame
jolie
où
est
allé
votre
mari
ah
toujours
les
dames
said
xavier
but
i
tell
you
michié
le
diable
he
is
at
ze
bottom
of
ze
grand
gulf
and
his
mouth
open
and
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
at
night
we
tied
up
under
the
shore
within
earshot
of
the
mutter
of
the
place
and
twice
that
night
i
awoke
with
clinched
hands
from
a
dream
of
being
spun
fiercely
against
the
rock
of
which
xavier
had
told
and
sucked
into
the
devil
s
mouth
under
the
water
dawn
came
as
i
was
fighting
the
mosquitoes
a
still
sultry
dawn
with
thunder
muttering
in
the
distance
we
breakfasted
in
silence
and
with
the
crew
standing
ready
at
the
oars
and
xavier
scanning
the
wide
expanse
of
waters
ahead
seeking
for
that
unmarked
point
whence
to
embark
on
this
perilous
journey
we
floated
down
the
stream
the
prospect
was
sufficiently
disquieting
on
that
murky
day
below
us
on
the
one
hand
a
rocky
bluff
reached
out
into
the
river
and
on
the
far
side
was
a
point
round
which
the
mississippi
doubled
and
flowed
back
on
itself
it
needed
no
trained
eye
to
guess
at
the
perils
of
the
place
on
the
one
side
the
mighty
current
charged
against
the
bluff
and
furious
at
the
obstacle
lashed
itself
into
a
hundred
sucks
and
whirls
their
course
marked
by
the
flotsam
plundered
from
the
forests
above
woe
betide
the
boat
that
got
into
this
devil
s
caldron
and
on
the
other
side
near
the
timbered
point
ran
a
counter
current
marked
by
forest
wreckage
flowing
to
venture
too
far
on
this
side
was
to
be
grounded
or
at
least
to
be
sent
back
to
embark
once
more
on
the
trial
but
where
was
the
channel
we
watched
xavier
with
bated
breath
not
once
did
he
take
his
eyes
from
the
swirling
water
ahead
but
gave
the
tiller
a
touch
from
time
to
time
now
right
now
left
and
called
in
a
monotone
for
the
port
or
starboard
oars
nearer
and
nearer
we
sped
dodging
the
snags
until
the
water
boiled
around
us
and
suddenly
the
boat
shot
forward
as
in
a
and
we
clutched
the
cabin
s
roof
a
triumphant
gleam
was
in
xavier
s
eyes
for
he
had
hit
the
channel
squarely
and
then
like
a
monster
out
of
the
deep
the
scaly
black
back
of
a
great
northern
pine
was
flung
up
beside
us
and
sheered
us
across
the
channel
until
we
were
at
the
very
edge
of
the
spinning
water
but
xavier
saw
it
and
quick
as
lightning
brought
his
helm
over
and
laughed
as
he
heard
it
crunching
along
our
keel
and
so
we
came
swiftly
around
the
bend
and
into
safety
once
more
the
next
day
there
was
the
petite
gulf
which
bothered
xavier
very
little
and
the
day
after
that
we
came
in
sight
of
natchez
on
her
heights
and
guided
our
boat
in
amongst
the
others
that
lined
the
shore
scowled
at
by
lounging
indians
there
and
eyed
suspiciously
by
a
spaniard
in
a
tawdry
uniform
who
represented
his
majesty
s
customs
here
we
stopped
for
a
day
and
a
night
that
xavier
and
his
crew
might
get
properly
drunk
on
tafia
while
nick
and
i
walked
about
the
town
and
waited
until
his
excellency
the
commandant
had
finished
dinner
that
we
might
present
our
letters
and
obtain
his
passport
natchez
at
that
date
was
a
sufficiently
unkempt
and
evil
place
of
dirty
ramshackle
houses
and
gambling
dens
where
men
of
the
four
nations
gamed
and
quarrelled
and
fought
we
were
glad
enough
to
get
away
the
following
morning
xavier
somewhat
saddened
by
the
loss
of
thirty
livres
of
which
he
had
no
memory
and
nick
and
myself
relieved
at
having
the
passports
in
our
pockets
i
have
mine
yet
among
my
papers

no

a
few
days
more
and
we
were
running
between
low
shores
which
seemed
to
hold
a
dark
enchantment
the
rivers
now
flowed
out
of
and
not
into
the
mississippi
and
xavier
called
them
bayous
and
often
it
took
much
skill
and
foresight
on
his
part
not
to
be
shot
into
the
lane
they
made
in
the
dark
forest
of
an
evening
and
the
forest
it
seemed
an
impenetrable
mystery
a
strange
tangle
of
fantastic
growths
the
chêne
vert
its
limbs
hung
funereally
with
spanish
moss
and
twined
in
the
mistletoe
s
death
embrace
the
dark
cypress
swamp
with
the
conelike
knees
above
the
yellow
and
here
and
there
grew
the
bridelike
magnolia
which
we
had
known
in
kentucky
wafting
its
perfume
over
the
waters
and
wondrous
flowers
and
vines
and
trees
with
french
names
that
bring
back
the
scene
to
me
even
now
with
a
whiff
of
romance
bois
d
arc
lilac
grande
volaille
birds
flew
hither
and
thither
the
names
of
every
one
of
which
xavier
knew
the
whistling
papabot
the
mournful
bittern
and
the
grosbeck
who
stood
like
a
sentinel
on
the
points
one
night
i
awoke
with
the
sweat
starting
from
my
brow
trying
to
collect
my
senses
and
i
lay
on
my
blanket
listening
to
such
plaintive
and
cries
as
i
had
never
known
human
cries
they
were
cries
as
of
children
in
distress
and
i
rose
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
deck
with
my
hair
standing
up
straight
to
discover
nick
beside
me
in
the
same
position
god
have
mercy
on
us
i
heard
him
mutter
what
s
that
it
sounds
like
the
wail
of
all
the
babies
since
the
world
we
listened
together
and
i
can
give
no
notion
of
the
hideous
mournfulness
of
the
sound
we
lay
in
a
swampy
little
inlet
and
the
forest
wall
made
a
dark
blur
against
the
sky
there
was
a
splash
near
the
boat
that
made
me
clutch
my
legs
the
wails
ceased
and
began
again
with
redoubled
intensity
nick
and
i
leaped
to
our
feet
and
stood
staring
horrified
over
the
gunwale
into
the
black
water
presently
there
was
a
laugh
behind
us
and
we
saw
xavier
resting
on
his
elbow
what
place
is
this
demanded
nick
ha
ha
said
xavier
shaking
with
unseemly
mirth
you
have
never
heard
ze
alligator
sing
michié
alligator
cried
nick
there
are
babies
in
the
water
i
tell
ha
ha
laughed
xavier
flinging
off
his
blanket
and
searching
for
his
flint
and
tinder
he
lighted
a
pine
knot
and
in
the
red
pulsing
flare
we
saw
what
seemed
to
be
a
dozen
black
logs
floating
on
the
surface
and
then
xavier
flung
the
cresset
at
them
fire
and
all
there
was
a
lashing
a
frightful
howl
from
one
of
the
logs
and
the
night
s
silence
once
more
often
after
that
our
slumbers
were
disturbed
and
we
would
rise
with
maledictions
in
our
mouths
to
fling
the
handiest
thing
at
the
serenaders
when
we
arose
in
the
morning
we
would
often
see
them
by
the
dozens
basking
in
the
shallows
with
their
wide
mouths
flapped
open
waiting
for
their
prey
sometimes
we
ran
upon
them
in
the
water
where
they
looked
like
the
pine
logs
from
the
north
and
nick
would
have
a
shot
at
them
when
he
hit
one
fairly
there
would
be
a
roar
and
a
churning
of
the
river
into
suds
at
length
there
were
signs
that
we
were
drifting
out
of
the
wilderness
and
one
morning
we
came
in
sight
of
a
rich
plantation
with
its
dark
orange
trees
and
fields
of
indigo
with
its
in
a
grove
and
as
we
drifted
we
heard
the
negroes
chanting
at
their
work
the
plaintive
cadence
of
the
strange
song
adding
to
the
mystery
of
the
scene
here
in
truth
was
a
new
world
a
land
of
peaceful
customs
green
and
moist
the
bells
of
it
seemed
an
expression
of
its
life
so
far
removed
from
our
own
striving
and
fighting
existence
in
kentucky
here
and
there
between
plantations
a
belfry
could
be
seen
above
the
cluster
of
the
little
white
village
planted
in
the
green
and
when
we
went
ashore
amongst
these
simple
french
people
they
treated
us
with
such
gentle
civility
and
kindness
that
we
would
fain
have
lingered
there
the
river
had
become
a
vast
yellow
lake
and
often
as
we
drifted
of
an
evening
the
wail
of
a
slave
dance
and
monotonous
beating
of
a
would
float
to
us
over
the
water
at
last
late
one
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
that
strange
city
which
had
filled
our
thoughts
for
many
days
chapter
xi
the
strange
city
nick
and
i
stood
by
the
mast
on
the
forward
part
of
the
cabin
staring
at
the
distant
city
while
xavier
sought
for
the
entrance
to
the
eddy
which
here
runs
along
the
shore
if
you
did
not
gain
this
entrance
so
he
explained
you
were
carried
by
a
swift
current
below
new
orleans
and
might
by
no
means
get
back
save
by
the
hiring
of
a
crew
xavier
however
was
not
to
be
caught
thus
and
presently
we
were
gliding
quietly
along
the
eastern
bank
or
levee
which
held
back
the
river
from
the
lowlands
then
as
we
looked
the
levee
became
an
esplanade
shaded
by
rows
of
willows
and
through
them
we
caught
sight
of
the
upper
galleries
and
low
curving
roofs
of
the
city
itself
there
cried
xavier
was
the
governor
s
house
on
the
corner
where
the
great
miro
lived
and
beyond
it
the
house
of
the
intendant
and
then
gliding
into
an
open
space
between
the
keel
boats
along
the
bank
stared
at
by
a
score
of
boatmen
and
idlers
from
above
we
came
to
the
end
of
our
long
journey
no
sooner
had
we
made
fast
than
we
were
boarded
by
a
shabby
customs
officer
who
when
he
had
seen
our
passports
bowed
politely
and
invited
us
to
land
we
leaped
ashore
gained
the
gravelled
walk
on
the
levee
and
looked
about
us
squalidity
first
met
our
eyes
below
us
crowded
between
the
levee
and
the
row
of
houses
were
dozens
of
squalid
tended
by
negroes
beyond
across
the
bare
place
d
armes
a
blackened
gap
in
the
line
of
houses
bore
witness
to
the
devastation
of
the
year
gone
by
while
here
and
there
a
roof
struck
by
the
setting
sun
gleamed
fiery
red
with
its
new
tiles
the
levee
was
deserted
save
for
the
negroes
and
the
river
men
time
for
siesta
michié
said
xavier
joining
us
i
will
show
you
ze
inn
of
which
i
spik
she
is
kep
by
my
fren
madame
xavier
said
nick
looking
at
the
rolling
flood
of
the
river
suppose
this
levee
should
break
ah
said
xavier
then
some
spaniard
who
never
have
a
bath
he
feel
what
water
is
followed
by
benjy
with
the
we
went
down
the
steps
set
in
the
levee
into
this
strange
foreign
city
it
was
like
unto
nothing
we
had
ever
seen
nor
can
i
give
an
adequate
notion
of
how
it
affected
us
such
a
mixture
it
seemed
of
dirt
and
poverty
and
wealth
and
romance
the
narrow
muddy
streets
ran
with
filth
and
on
each
side
along
the
houses
was
a
walk
held
up
by
the
curved
sides
of
broken
flatboats
where
two
men
might
scarcely
pass
the
houses
too
had
an
odd
and
foreign
look
some
of
wood
some
of
upright
logs
and
plaster
and
newer
ones
spanish
in
style
of
adobe
with
curving
roofs
of
red
tiles
and
strong
eaves
spreading
over
the
banquette
as
the
sidewalk
was
called
casting
shadows
on
walls
since
new
orleans
was
in
a
swamp
the
older
houses
for
the
most
part
were
lifted
some
seven
feet
above
the
ground
and
many
of
these
houses
had
wide
galleries
on
the
street
side
here
and
there
a
shop
was
set
in
the
wall
a
watchmaker
was
to
be
seen
poring
over
his
work
at
a
tiny
window
a
shoemaker
on
the
floor
again
at
an
open
wicket
we
caught
a
glimpse
through
a
cool
archway
into
a
flowering
stalwart
negresses
with
bright
kerchiefs
made
way
for
us
on
the
banquette
hands
on
hips
they
swung
along
erect
with
baskets
of
cakes
and
sweetmeats
on
their
heads
musically
crying
their
wares
at
length
turning
a
corner
we
came
to
a
white
wooden
house
on
the
rue
royale
with
a
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
the
entrance
in
place
of
a
door
a
flimsy
curtain
hung
in
the
doorway
and
pushing
this
aside
we
followed
xavier
through
a
darkened
hall
to
a
wide
gallery
that
overlooked
a
this
was
shaded
by
several
great
trees
which
grew
there
the
house
and
gallery
ran
down
one
other
side
of
it
and
the
two
remaining
sides
were
made
up
of
a
series
of
low
cabins
these
forming
the
various
outhouses
and
the
kitchen
at
the
far
end
of
this
gallery
a
sallow
buxom
lady
sat
sewing
at
a
table
and
xavier
saluted
her
very
respectfully
madame
he
said
i
have
brought
you
from
louis
with
michié
gratiot
s
compliments
two
young
american
gentlemen
who
are
travelling
to
amuse
the
lady
rose
and
beamed
upon
us
from
monsieur
gratiot
she
said
you
are
very
welcome
gentlemen
to
such
poor
accommodations
as
i
have
it
is
not
unusual
to
have
american
gentlemen
in
new
orleans
for
many
come
here
first
and
last
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
two
of
my
best
rooms
are
vacant
zoey
there
was
a
shrill
answer
from
the
court
below
and
a
negro
girl
in
a
yellow
turban
came
running
up
while
madame
bouvet
bustled
along
the
gallery
and
opened
the
doors
of
two
darkened
rooms
within
i
could
dimly
see
a
walnut
dresser
a
chair
and
a
walnut
bed
on
which
was
spread
a
mosquito
bar
voilá
messieurs
cried
madame
bouvet
there
is
still
a
little
time
for
a
siesta
no
siesta
cried
madame
eying
us
aghast
ah
the
americans
they
never
rest
we
bade
farewell
to
the
good
xavier
promising
to
see
him
soon
and
nick
shouting
to
benjy
to
open
the
proceeded
to
array
himself
in
the
clothes
which
had
made
so
much
havoc
at
louis
i
boded
no
good
from
this
proceeding
but
i
reflected
as
i
watched
him
dress
that
i
might
as
well
try
to
turn
the
mississippi
from
its
course
as
to
attempt
to
keep
my
cousin
from
the
search
for
gallant
adventure
and
i
reflected
that
his
indulgence
in
would
serve
the
more
to
divert
any
suspicions
which
might
fall
upon
my
own
head
at
last
when
the
setting
sun
was
flooding
the
he
stood
arrayed
upon
the
gallery
ready
to
venture
forth
to
conquest
madame
bouvet
s
tavern
or
hotel
or
whatever
she
was
pleased
to
call
it
was
not
immaculately
clean
before
passing
into
the
street
we
stood
for
a
moment
looking
into
the
public
room
on
the
left
of
the
hallway
a
long
saloon
evidently
used
in
the
early
afternoon
for
a
dining
room
and
at
the
back
of
it
a
wide
window
capped
by
a
spanish
arch
looked
out
on
the
gallery
near
this
window
was
a
gay
party
of
young
men
engaged
at
cards
waited
on
by
the
zoey
and
drinking
what
evidently
was
claret
punch
the
sounds
of
their
jests
and
laughter
pursued
us
out
of
the
house
the
town
was
waking
from
its
siesta
the
streets
filling
and
people
stopped
to
stare
at
nick
as
we
passed
but
nick
who
was
plainly
in
search
of
something
he
did
not
find
hurried
on
we
soon
came
to
the
quarter
which
had
suffered
most
from
the
fire
where
new
houses
had
gone
up
or
were
in
the
building
beside
the
blackened
logs
of
many
of
bienville
s
time
then
we
came
to
a
high
white
wall
that
surrounded
a
large
garden
and
within
it
was
a
long
massive
building
of
some
beauty
and
pretension
with
a
high
latticed
belfry
and
heavy
walls
and
with
arched
dormers
in
the
sloping
roof
as
we
stood
staring
at
it
through
the
iron
grille
set
in
the
archway
of
the
lodge
nick
declared
that
it
put
him
in
mind
of
some
of
the
châteaux
he
had
seen
in
france
and
he
crossed
the
street
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
premises
an
old
man
in
coarse
blue
linen
came
out
of
the
lodge
and
spoke
to
me
it
is
the
convent
of
the
good
nuns
the
ursulines
monsieur
he
said
in
french
and
it
was
built
long
ago
in
the
sieur
de
bienville
s
time
when
the
colony
was
young
for
years
monsieur
the
young
ladies
of
the
city
have
come
here
to
be
what
does
he
say
demanded
nick
pricking
up
his
ears
as
he
came
across
the
street
that
young
men
have
been
sent
to
the
mines
of
brazil
for
climbing
the
walls
i
answered
who
wants
to
climb
the
walls
said
nick
disgusted
the
young
ladies
of
the
town
go
to
school
here
i
answered
it
is
a
it
might
serve
to
pass
the
time
said
nick
gazing
with
a
new
interest
at
the
latticed
windows
how
much
would
you
take
my
friend
to
let
us
in
at
the
back
way
this
evening
he
demanded
of
the
porter
in
french
the
good
man
gasped
lifted
his
hands
in
horror
and
straightway
let
loose
upon
nick
a
torrent
of
french
invectives
that
had
not
the
least
effect
except
to
cause
a
blacksmith
s
apprentice
and
two
negroes
to
stop
and
stare
at
us
pooh
exclaimed
nick
when
the
man
had
paused
for
want
of
breath
it
is
no
trick
to
get
over
that
bon
dieu
cried
the
porter
you
are
kentuckians
yes
i
might
have
known
that
you
were
kentuckians
and
i
shall
advise
the
good
sisters
to
put
glass
on
the
wall
and
keep
a
the
young
ladies
are
beautiful
you
say
said
nick
at
this
juncture
with
the
negroes
grinning
and
the
porter
near
bursting
with
rage
there
came
out
of
the
lodge
the
fattest
woman
i
have
ever
seen
for
her
size
she
seized
her
husband
by
the
back
of
his
loose
frock
and
pulled
him
away
crying
out
that
he
was
losing
time
by
talking
to
vagabonds
besides
disturbing
the
good
sisters
then
we
went
away
nick
following
the
convent
wall
down
to
the
river
turning
southward
under
the
bank
past
the
huddle
of
we
came
suddenly
upon
a
sight
that
made
us
pause
and
wonder
new
orleans
was
awake
a
gay
and
laughing
throng
paced
the
esplanade
on
the
levee
under
the
willows
with
here
and
there
a
cavalier
on
horseback
on
the
royal
road
below
across
the
place
d
armes
the
spire
of
the
parish
church
stood
against
the
fading
sky
and
to
the
westward
the
mighty
river
stretched
away
like
a
gilded
floor
it
was
a
strange
throng
there
were
grave
spaniards
in
long
cloaks
and
feathered
beavers
jolly
merchants
and
artisans
in
short
linen
jackets
each
with
his
tabatière
the
wives
with
bits
of
finery
the
children
laughing
and
shouting
and
dodging
in
and
out
between
fathers
and
mothers
beaming
with
quiet
pride
and
contentment
swarthy
with
their
worsted
belts
gaudy
negresses
chanting
in
the
soft
patois
and
here
and
there
a
blanketed
indian
nor
was
this
all
some
occasion
so
madame
bouvet
had
told
us
had
brought
a
sprinkling
of
fashion
to
town
that
day
and
it
was
a
fashion
to
astonish
me
there
were
fine
gentlemen
with
swords
and
silk
waistcoats
and
silver
and
ladies
in
filmy
summer
gowns
greuze
ruled
the
mode
in
france
then
but
new
orleans
had
not
got
beyond
watteau
as
for
nick
and
me
we
knew
nothing
of
greuze
and
watteau
then
and
we
could
only
stare
in
astonishment
and
for
once
we
saw
an
officer
of
the
louisiana
regiment
resplendent
in
a
uniform
that
might
have
served
at
court
ay
and
there
was
yet
another
sort
every
flatboatman
who
returned
to
kentucky
was
full
of
tales
of
the
marvellous
beauty
of
the
quadroons
and
octoroons
stories
which
i
had
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
they
had
not
indeed
been
greatly
overdrawn
for
here
were
these
ladies
in
the
flesh
their
great
opaque
almond
eyes
consuming
us
with
a
swift
glance
and
each
walking
with
a
languid
grace
beside
her
duenna
their
faces
were
like
old
ivory
their
dress
the
stern
miro
himself
could
scarce
repress
in
former
times
they
had
been
lavish
in
their
finery
and
even
now
earrings
still
gleamed
and
color
broke
out
irrepressibly
nick
was
delighted
but
he
had
not
dragged
me
twice
the
length
of
the
esplanade
ere
his
eye
was
caught
by
a
young
lady
in
pink
who
sauntered
between
an
elderly
gentleman
in
black
silk
and
a
young
man
more
gayly
dressed
egad
said
nick
there
is
my
divinity
and
i
need
not
look
a
step
i
laughed
you
have
but
to
choose
i
suppose
and
all
falls
your
way
i
answered
but
look
he
cried
halting
me
to
stare
after
the
girl
what
a
face
and
what
a
form
and
what
a
carriage
by
jove
there
is
breeding
for
you
and
davy
did
you
mark
the
gentle
rounded
arm
thank
heaven
these
short
sleeves
are
the
you
are
mad
nick
i
answered
pulling
him
on
these
people
are
not
to
be
stared
at
so
and
once
i
present
our
letters
to
monsieur
de
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
know
any
of
look
said
he
that
young
man
lover
or
husband
is
a
brute
on
my
soul
they
are
the
three
had
stopped
by
a
bench
under
a
tree
the
young
man
who
wore
claret
silk
and
a
sword
had
one
of
those
thin
faces
of
dirty
complexion
which
show
the
ravages
of
dissipation
and
he
was
talking
with
a
rapidity
and
vehemence
of
which
only
a
latin
tongue
will
admit
we
could
see
likewise
that
the
girl
was
answering
with
spirit
indeed
i
should
write
a
stronger
word
than
spirit
while
the
elderly
gentleman
who
had
a
fleshy
face
and
figure
was
plainly
doing
his
best
to
calm
them
both
people
who
were
passing
stared
curiously
at
the
three
your
divinity
evidently
has
a
temper
i
remarked
for
that
scoundel
certainly
said
nick
but
come
they
are
moving
you
mean
to
follow
them
i
exclaimed
why
not
said
he
we
will
find
out
where
they
live
and
who
they
are
at
and
you
have
taken
a
fancy
to
this
girl
i
have
looked
them
all
over
and
she
s
by
far
the
best
i
ve
seen
i
can
say
so
much
but
she
may
be
married
i
said
weakly
tut
davy
he
answered
it
s
more
than
likely
from
the
violence
of
their
quarrel
but
if
so
we
will
try
we
i
exclaimed
oh
come
on
he
cried
dragging
me
by
the
sleeve
or
we
shall
lose
i
resisted
no
longer
but
followed
him
down
the
levee
in
my
heart
thanking
heaven
that
he
had
not
taken
a
fancy
to
an
octoroon
twilight
had
set
in
strongly
the
gay
crowd
was
beginning
to
disperse
and
in
the
distance
the
three
figures
could
be
seen
making
their
way
across
the
place
d
armes
the
girl
hanging
on
the
elderly
gentleman
s
arm
and
the
young
man
following
with
seeming
sullenness
behind
they
turned
into
one
of
the
narrower
streets
and
we
quickened
our
steps
lights
gleamed
in
the
houses
voices
and
laughter
and
once
the
tinkle
of
a
guitar
came
to
us
from
and
gallery
but
nick
hurrying
on
came
near
to
bowling
more
than
one
respectable
citizen
we
met
on
the
banquette
into
the
ditch
we
reached
a
corner
and
the
three
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
curse
the
luck
cried
nick
we
have
lost
them
the
next
time
i
ll
stop
for
no
there
was
no
particular
reason
why
i
should
have
been
penitent
but
i
ventured
to
say
that
the
house
they
had
entered
could
not
be
far
off
and
how
the
devil
are
we
to
know
it
demanded
nick
this
puzzled
me
for
a
moment
but
presently
i
began
to
think
that
the
two
might
begin
quarrelling
again
and
said
so
nick
laughed
and
put
his
arm
around
my
neck
you
have
no
mean
ability
for
intrigue
when
you
put
your
mind
to
it
davy
he
said
i
vow
i
believe
you
are
in
love
with
the
girl
i
disclaimed
this
with
some
vehemence
indeed
i
had
scarcely
seen
her
they
can
t
be
far
off
said
nick
we
ll
pitch
on
a
likely
house
and
camp
in
front
of
it
until
and
be
flung
into
a
filthy
calaboose
by
a
constable
said
i
no
thank
we
walked
on
and
halfway
down
the
block
we
came
upon
a
new
house
with
more
pretensions
than
its
neighbors
it
was
set
back
a
little
from
the
street
and
there
was
a
high
adobe
wall
into
which
a
pair
of
gates
were
set
and
a
wicket
opening
in
one
of
them
over
the
wall
hung
a
dark
fringe
of
magnolia
and
orange
boughs
on
each
of
the
a
crouching
lion
was
outlined
dimly
against
the
fainting
light
and
by
crossing
the
street
we
could
see
the
upper
line
of
a
latticed
gallery
under
the
low
roof
we
took
our
stand
within
the
empty
doorway
of
a
blackened
house
nearly
opposite
and
there
we
waited
nick
murmuring
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
things
in
my
ear
but
presently
i
began
to
reflect
upon
the
consequences
of
being
taken
in
such
a
situation
by
a
constable
and
dragged
into
the
light
of
a
public
examination
i
put
this
to
nick
as
plainly
as
i
could
and
was
declaring
my
intention
of
going
back
to
madame
bouvet
s
when
the
sound
of
voices
arrested
me
the
voices
came
from
the
latticed
gallery
and
they
were
low
at
first
but
soon
rose
to
such
an
angry
pitch
that
i
made
no
doubt
we
had
hit
on
the
right
house
after
all
what
they
said
was
lost
to
us
but
i
could
distinguish
the
woman
s
voice
and
vibrant
as
though
insisting
upon
a
refusal
and
the
man
s
scarce
adult
tones
now
high
as
though
with
balked
passion
now
shaken
and
imploring
i
was
for
leaving
the
place
at
once
but
nick
clutched
my
arm
tightly
and
suddenly
as
i
stood
undecided
the
voices
ceased
entirely
there
were
the
sounds
of
a
scuffle
and
the
lattice
of
the
gallery
was
flung
open
in
the
all
but
darkness
we
saw
a
figure
climb
over
the
railing
hang
suspended
for
an
instant
and
drop
lightly
to
the
ground
then
came
the
light
relief
of
a
woman
s
gown
in
the
opening
of
the
lattice
the
cry
auguste
auguste
the
wicket
in
the
gate
opened
and
slammed
and
a
man
ran
at
top
speed
along
the
banquette
towards
the
levee
instinctively
i
seized
nick
by
the
arm
as
he
started
out
of
the
doorway
let
me
go
he
cried
angrily
let
me
go
but
i
held
on
are
you
mad
i
said
he
did
not
answer
but
twisted
and
struggled
and
before
i
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
had
pushed
me
off
the
stone
step
into
a
tangle
of
blackened
beams
behind
i
dropped
his
arm
to
save
myself
and
it
was
mere
good
fortune
that
i
did
not
break
an
ankle
in
the
fall
when
i
had
gained
the
step
again
he
was
gone
after
the
man
and
a
portly
citizen
stood
in
front
of
me
looking
into
the
doorway
qu
la
dedans
he
demanded
sharply
it
was
a
sufficiently
embarrassing
situation
i
put
on
a
bold
front
however
and
not
deigning
to
answer
pushed
past
him
and
walked
with
as
much
leisure
as
possible
along
the
banquette
in
the
direction
which
nick
had
taken
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
and
in
the
darkness
i
could
just
make
out
the
man
standing
where
i
had
left
him
in
great
uneasiness
i
pursued
my
way
my
imagination
summing
up
for
nick
all
kinds
of
adventures
with
disagreeable
consequences
i
walked
for
some
time
it
may
have
been
half
an
hour
aimlessly
and
finally
decided
it
would
be
best
to
go
back
to
madame
bouvet
s
and
await
the
issue
with
as
much
calmness
as
possible
he
might
not
after
all
have
caught
the
fellow
there
were
few
people
in
the
dark
streets
but
at
length
i
met
a
man
who
gave
me
directions
and
presently
found
my
way
back
to
my
lodging
place
talk
and
laughter
floated
through
the
latticed
windows
into
the
street
and
when
i
had
pushed
back
the
curtain
and
looked
into
the
saloon
i
found
the
same
gaming
party
at
the
end
of
it
sitting
in
their
amidst
the
moths
and
insects
that
hovered
around
the
candles
ah
monsieur
said
madame
bouvet
s
voice
behind
me
you
must
excuse
them
they
will
come
here
and
play
the
young
gentlemen
and
i
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
drive
them
away
though
sometimes
i
lose
a
respectable
lodger
by
their
noise
but
after
all
what
would
you
she
added
with
a
shrug
i
love
them
the
young
men
but
monsieur
she
cried
you
have
had
no
supper
and
where
is
monsieur
your
companion
comme
il
est
beau
garçon
he
will
be
in
presently
i
answered
with
unwarranted
assumption
madame
shot
at
me
the
swiftest
of
glances
and
laughed
and
i
suspected
that
she
divined
nick
s
propensity
for
adventure
however
she
said
nothing
more
than
to
bid
me
sit
down
at
the
table
and
presently
zoey
came
in
with
lights
and
strange
highly
seasoned
dishes
which
i
ate
with
avidity
notwithstanding
my
uneasiness
of
mind
watching
the
while
the
party
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
there
were
five
young
gentlemen
playing
a
game
i
knew
not
with
intervals
of
intense
silence
and
boisterous
laughter
and
execrations
while
the
cards
were
being
shuffled
and
the
money
rang
on
the
board
and
glasses
were
being
filled
from
a
stand
at
one
side
presently
madame
bouvet
returned
and
placing
before
me
a
cup
of
wondrous
coffee
advanced
down
the
room
towards
them
ah
messieurs
she
cried
you
will
ruin
my
poor
the
five
rose
and
bowed
with
marked
profundity
one
of
them
with
a
puffy
weak
face
answered
her
briskly
and
after
a
little
raillery
she
came
back
to
me
i
had
a
question
not
over
discreet
on
my
tongue
s
tip
there
are
some
fine
residences
going
up
here
madame
i
said
since
the
fire
monsieur
the
dreadful
fire
of
good
friday
a
year
ago
you
admire
them
i
saw
one
i
answered
with
indifference
with
a
wall
and
lions
on
the
mon
dieu
that
is
a
house
exclaimed
madame
it
belongs
to
monsieur
de
to
monsieur
de
i
repeated
she
shot
a
look
at
me
she
had
bright
little
eyes
like
a
bird
s
that
shone
in
the
candlelight
you
know
him
monsieur
i
heard
of
him
in
louis
i
answered
you
will
meet
him
no
doubt
she
continued
he
is
a
very
fine
gentleman
his
grandfather
was
of
the
colony
and
he
himself
is
a
cousin
of
the
marquis
de
who
has
two
châteaux
a
house
in
paris
and
is
a
favorite
of
the
she
paused
as
if
to
let
this
impress
itself
upon
me
and
added
archly
tenez
monsieur
there
is
a
daughter
she
stopped
abruptly
i
followed
her
glance
and
my
first
impression
of
gave
me
a
shock
my
second
confirmed
it
for
in
the
beyond
the
rays
of
the
candle
was
a
thin
eager
face
prematurely
lined
with
lustrous
eyes
that
spoke
eloquently
of
indulgence
in
an
instant
i
knew
it
to
be
that
of
the
young
man
whom
i
had
seen
on
the
levee
monsieur
auguste
stammered
madame
bon
soir
madame
he
cried
gayly
with
a
bow
diable
they
are
already
at
it
i
see
and
the
punch
in
the
bowl
i
will
win
back
what
i
have
lost
by
a
week
of
accursed
monsieur
your
father
has
relented
perhaps
said
madame
deferentially
relented
cried
the
young
man
not
a
sou
c
est
égal
i
have
the
means
here
and
he
tapped
his
pocket
i
have
the
means
here
to
set
me
on
my
feet
again
he
spoke
with
a
note
of
triumph
and
madame
took
a
curious
step
towards
him
qu
c
est
monsieur
auguste
she
inquired
he
drew
something
that
glittered
from
his
pocket
and
beckoned
to
her
to
follow
him
down
the
room
which
she
did
with
alacrity
ha
adolphe
he
cried
to
the
young
man
of
the
puffy
face
i
will
have
my
revenge
voilà
and
he
held
up
the
shining
thing
this
goes
to
the
highest
bidder
and
you
will
agree
that
it
is
worth
a
pretty
they
rose
from
their
chairs
and
clustered
around
him
at
the
table
madame
in
their
midst
staring
with
bent
heads
at
the
trinket
which
he
held
to
the
light
it
was
madame
s
voice
i
heard
first
in
a
kind
of
frightened
cry
mon
dieu
monsieur
auguste
you
will
not
part
with
that
she
exclaimed
why
not
demanded
the
young
man
indifferently
it
was
painted
by
boze
the
back
is
solid
gold
and
the
jew
in
the
rue
toulouse
will
give
me
four
hundred
livres
for
it
there
followed
immediately
such
a
chorus
of
questions
exclamations
and
shrill
protests
from
madame
bouvet
that
i
being
such
a
laborious
french
scholar
could
distinguish
but
little
of
what
they
said
i
looked
in
wonderment
at
the
gesticulating
figures
grouped
against
the
light
madame
imploring
the
youthful
profile
of
the
newcomer
marked
with
a
cynical
and
scornful
refusal
more
than
once
i
was
for
rising
out
of
my
chair
to
go
over
and
see
for
myself
what
the
object
was
and
then
suddenly
i
perceived
madame
bouvet
coming
towards
me
in
evident
agitation
she
sank
into
the
chair
beside
me
if
i
had
four
hundred
livres
she
said
if
i
had
four
hundred
livres
and
what
then
i
asked
monsieur
she
said
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
auguste
de
auguste
de
i
exclaimed
he
is
the
son
of
that
monsieur
de
of
whom
we
spoke
she
answered
a
wild
lad
a
spendthrift
a
gambler
if
you
like
and
yet
he
is
a
monsieur
and
i
can
not
refuse
him
it
is
the
miniature
of
mademoiselle
hélène
de
the
daughter
of
the
marquis
sent
to
mamselle
toinette
his
sister
from
france
how
he
has
obtained
it
i
know
ah
i
exclaimed
sharply
the
explanation
of
the
scene
of
which
i
had
been
a
witness
coming
to
me
swiftly
the
rascal
had
wrenched
it
from
her
in
the
gallery
and
fled
monsieur
continued
madame
too
excited
to
notice
my
interruption
if
i
had
four
hundred
livres
i
would
buy
it
of
him
and
monsieur
de
père
would
willingly
pay
it
back
in
the
i
reflected
i
had
a
letter
in
my
pocket
to
monsieur
de
the
sum
was
not
large
and
the
act
of
monsieur
auguste
de
in
every
light
was
detestable
a
rising
anger
decided
me
and
i
took
a
wallet
from
my
pocket
i
will
buy
the
miniature
madame
i
said
she
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
god
bless
you
monsieur
she
cried
if
you
could
see
mamselle
toinette
you
would
pay
twice
the
sum
the
whole
town
loves
her
monsieur
auguste
monsieur
auguste
she
shouted
here
is
a
gentleman
who
will
buy
your
the
six
young
men
stopped
talking
and
stared
at
me
with
one
accord
madame
arose
and
i
followed
her
down
the
room
towards
them
and
had
it
not
been
for
my
indignation
i
should
have
felt
sufficiently
ridiculous
young
monsieur
de
came
forward
with
the
easy
insolence
to
which
he
had
been
born
and
looked
me
over
monsieur
is
an
american
he
said
i
understand
that
you
have
offered
this
miniature
for
four
hundred
livres
i
said
it
is
the
jew
s
price
he
answered
mais
pardieu
what
will
you
he
added
with
a
shrug
i
must
have
the
money
regardez
monsieur
you
have
a
bargain
here
is
mademoiselle
hélène
de
daughter
of
my
lord
the
marquis
of
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
be
a
cousin
and
he
made
a
bow
it
is
by
the
famous
court
painter
joseph
boze
and
mademoiselle
de
herself
is
a
favorite
of
her
he
held
the
portrait
close
to
the
candle
and
regarded
it
critically
mademoiselle
hélène
victoire
marie
de
painted
in
a
costume
of
henry
the
second
s
time
with
a
ruff
you
notice
which
she
wore
at
a
ball
given
by
his
highness
the
prince
of
condé
at
chantilly
a
trifle
haughty
if
you
like
monsieur
but
i
venture
to
say
you
will
be
hopelessly
in
love
with
her
within
the
at
this
there
was
a
general
titter
from
the
young
gentlemen
at
the
table
all
of
which
is
neither
here
nor
there
monsieur
i
answered
sharply
the
question
is
purely
a
commercial
one
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
lady
s
character
or
it
is
well
said
monsieur
madame
bouvet
put
in
monsieur
auguste
de
shrugged
his
slim
shoulders
and
laid
down
the
portrait
on
the
walnut
table
four
hundred
livres
monsieur
he
said
i
counted
out
the
money
scrutinized
by
the
curious
eyes
of
his
companions
and
pushed
it
over
to
him
he
bowed
carelessly
sat
him
down
and
began
to
shuffle
the
cards
while
i
picked
up
the
miniature
and
walked
out
of
the
room
before
i
had
gone
twenty
paces
i
heard
them
laughing
at
their
game
and
shouting
out
the
stakes
suddenly
i
bethought
myself
of
nick
what
if
he
should
come
in
and
discover
the
party
at
the
table
i
stopped
short
in
the
hallway
and
there
madame
bouvet
overtook
me
how
can
i
thank
you
monsieur
she
said
and
then
you
will
return
the
portrait
to
monsieur
de
i
have
a
letter
from
monsieur
gratiot
to
that
gentleman
which
i
shall
deliver
in
the
morning
i
answered
and
now
madame
i
have
a
favor
to
ask
of
i
am
at
monsieur
s
service
she
answered
simply
when
temple
comes
in
he
is
not
to
go
into
that
room
i
said
pointing
to
the
door
of
the
saloon
i
have
my
reasons
for
requesting
for
answer
madame
went
to
the
door
closed
it
and
turned
the
key
then
she
sat
down
beside
a
little
table
with
a
candlestick
and
took
up
her
knitting
it
will
be
as
monsieur
says
she
answered
i
smiled
and
when
temple
comes
in
will
you
kindly
say
that
i
am
waiting
for
him
in
his
room
i
asked
as
monsieur
says
she
answered
i
wish
monsieur
a
and
pleasant
she
took
a
candlestick
from
the
table
lighted
the
candle
and
handed
it
me
with
a
courtesy
i
bowed
and
made
my
way
along
the
gallery
above
the
deserted
entering
my
room
and
closing
the
door
after
me
i
drew
the
miniature
from
my
pocket
and
stood
gazing
at
it
for
i
know
not
how
long
chapter
xii
les
iles
i
stood
staring
at
the
portrait
i
say
with
a
kind
of
fascination
that
astonished
me
seeing
that
it
had
come
to
me
in
such
a
way
it
was
no
french
face
of
my
imagination
and
as
i
looked
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
knew
mademoiselle
hélène
de
and
yet
i
smile
as
i
write
this
realizing
full
well
that
my
strange
and
foreign
surroundings
and
my
unforeseen
adventure
had
much
to
do
with
my
state
of
mind
the
lady
in
the
miniature
might
have
been
eighteen
or
her
features
were
of
the
clearest
cut
the
nose
the
least
trifle
aquiline
and
by
a
blurred
outline
the
painter
had
given
to
the
black
hair
piled
high
upon
the
head
a
suggestion
of
waviness
the
eyebrows
were
straight
the
brown
eyes
looked
at
the
world
with
an
almost
scornful
sense
of
humor
and
i
marked
that
there
was
determination
in
the
chin
here
was
a
face
that
could
be
infinitely
haughty
or
infinitely
tender
a
mouth
of
witty
nay
perhaps
cutting
repartee
of
brevity
and
force
a
lady
who
spoke
quickly
moved
quickly
or
reposed
absolutely
a
person
who
commanded
by
nature
and
yet
dare
i
venture
the
thought
was
capable
of
a
supreme
surrender
i
was
aroused
from
this
odd
revery
by
footsteps
on
the
gallery
and
nick
burst
into
the
room
without
pausing
to
look
about
him
he
flung
himself
lengthwise
on
the
bed
on
top
of
the
mosquito
bar
a
thousand
curses
on
such
a
place
he
cried
it
is
full
of
rat
holes
and
rabbit
did
you
catch
your
man
i
asked
innocently
catch
him
said
nick
with
a
little
excusable
profanity
he
went
in
at
one
end
of
such
a
warren
and
came
out
at
another
i
waited
for
him
in
two
streets
until
an
officious
person
chanced
along
and
threatened
to
take
me
before
the
alcalde
what
the
devil
is
that
you
have
got
in
your
hand
davy
he
demanded
raising
his
head
a
miniature
that
took
my
fancy
and
which
i
he
rose
from
the
bed
yawned
and
taking
it
in
his
hand
held
it
to
the
light
i
watched
him
curiously
lord
he
said
it
is
such
a
passion
as
i
might
have
suspected
of
you
there
was
nothing
said
about
passion
i
answered
hotly
then
why
the
deuce
did
you
buy
it
he
said
with
some
pertinence
this
staggered
me
a
man
may
fancy
a
thing
without
indulging
in
a
passion
i
suppose
i
replied
nick
held
the
picture
at
arm
s
length
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
regarded
it
critically
faith
said
he
you
may
thank
heaven
it
is
only
a
picture
if
such
a
one
ever
got
hold
of
you
davy
she
would
general
you
even
as
you
general
me
egad
he
added
with
a
laugh
there
would
be
no
more
walking
the
streets
at
night
in
search
of
adventure
for
you
consider
carefully
the
masterful
features
of
that
lady
and
thank
god
you
haven
t
got
i
was
inclined
to
be
angry
but
ended
by
laughing
there
will
be
no
rivalry
between
us
at
least
i
said
rivalry
exclaimed
nick
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
aspire
to
such
abject
slavery
when
i
marry
it
will
be
to
all
the
more
honor
in
such
a
conquest
i
suggested
davy
said
he
i
have
long
been
looking
for
some
such
flaw
in
your
insuperable
wisdom
but
i
vow
i
can
keep
my
eyes
open
no
longer
benjy
a
smothered
response
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
benjy
duly
appeared
in
the
doorway
blinking
at
the
candlelight
to
put
his
master
to
bed
we
slept
that
night
with
no
bed
covering
save
the
mosquito
bar
as
was
the
custom
in
new
orleans
indeed
the
heat
was
most
oppressive
but
we
had
become
to
some
extent
inured
to
it
on
the
boat
and
we
were
both
in
such
sound
health
that
our
slumbers
were
not
disturbed
early
in
the
morning
however
i
was
awakened
by
a
negro
song
from
the
and
i
lay
pleasantly
for
some
minutes
listening
to
the
early
sounds
breathing
in
the
aroma
of
coffee
which
mingled
with
the
odor
of
the
flowers
of
the
court
until
zoey
herself
appeared
in
the
doorway
holding
a
cup
in
her
hand
i
arose
and
taking
the
miniature
from
the
table
gazed
at
it
in
the
yellow
morning
light
and
then
having
dressed
myself
i
put
it
carefully
in
my
pocket
and
sat
down
at
my
portfolio
to
compose
a
letter
to
polly
ann
knowing
that
a
description
of
what
i
had
seen
in
new
orleans
would
amuse
her
this
done
i
went
out
into
the
gallery
where
madame
was
already
seated
at
her
knitting
in
the
shade
of
the
great
tree
that
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
court
and
spread
its
branches
over
the
eaves
she
arose
and
courtesied
with
a
questioning
smile
madame
i
asked
is
it
too
early
to
present
myself
to
monsieur
de
pardieu
no
monsieur
we
are
early
risers
in
the
south
for
we
have
our
siesta
you
are
going
to
return
the
portrait
monsieur
i
nodded
god
bless
you
for
the
deed
said
she
tenez
monsieur
she
added
stepping
closer
to
me
you
will
tell
his
father
that
you
bought
it
from
monsieur
auguste
i
saw
that
she
had
a
soft
spot
in
her
heart
for
the
rogue
i
will
make
no
promises
madame
i
answered
she
looked
at
me
timidly
appealingly
but
i
bowed
and
departed
the
sun
was
riding
up
into
the
sky
the
walls
already
glowing
with
his
heat
and
a
midsummer
languor
seemed
to
pervade
the
streets
as
i
walked
along
the
shadows
now
were
sharply
defined
the
checkered
foliage
of
the
trees
was
flung
in
black
against
the
wall
of
the
house
with
the
lions
and
the
gallery
which
we
had
watched
the
night
before
seemed
silent
and
deserted
i
knocked
at
the
gate
and
presently
a
gardienne
opened
it
was
monsieur
de
at
home
the
gardienne
looked
me
over
and
evidently
finding
me
respectable
replied
with
many
protestations
of
sorrow
that
he
was
not
that
he
had
gone
with
mamselle
very
early
that
morning
to
his
country
place
at
les
îles
this
information
i
extracted
with
difficulty
for
i
was
not
by
any
means
versed
in
the
negro
patois
as
i
walked
back
to
madame
bouvet
s
i
made
up
my
mind
that
there
was
but
the
one
thing
to
do
to
go
at
once
to
monsieur
de
s
plantation
finding
madame
still
waiting
in
the
gallery
i
asked
her
to
direct
me
thither
you
have
but
to
follow
the
road
that
runs
southward
along
the
levee
and
some
three
leagues
will
bring
you
to
it
monsieur
you
will
inquire
for
monsieur
de
can
you
direct
me
to
daniel
clark
s
i
asked
the
american
merchant
and
banker
the
friend
and
associate
of
the
great
general
wilkinson
whom
you
sent
down
to
us
last
year
certainly
monsieur
he
will
no
doubt
give
you
better
advice
than
i
on
this
i
found
clark
in
his
and
i
had
not
talked
with
him
five
minutes
before
i
began
to
suspect
that
if
a
treasonable
understanding
existed
between
wilkinson
and
the
spanish
government
clark
was
innocent
of
it
he
being
the
only
prominent
american
in
the
place
it
was
natural
that
wilkinson
should
have
formed
with
him
a
business
arrangement
to
care
for
the
cargoes
he
sent
down
indeed
after
we
had
sat
for
some
time
chatting
together
clark
began
himself
to
make
guarded
inquiries
on
this
very
subject
did
i
know
wilkinson
how
was
his
enterprise
of
selling
kentucky
products
regarded
at
home
but
i
do
not
intend
to
burden
this
story
with
accounts
of
a
matter
which
though
it
has
never
been
wholly
clear
has
been
long
since
fairly
settled
in
the
public
mind
clark
was
most
amiable
accepted
my
statement
that
i
was
travelling
for
pleasure
and
honored
monsieur
chouteau
s
bon
for
my
purchase
of
the
miniature
had
deprived
me
of
nearly
all
my
ready
money
and
said
that
temple
and
i
would
need
horses
to
get
to
les
îles
and
unless
you
purpose
going
back
to
kentucky
by
keel
boat
or
round
by
sea
to
philadelphia
or
new
york
and
cross
the
mountains
he
said
you
will
need
good
horses
for
your
journey
through
natchez
and
the
cumberland
country
there
is
a
consignment
of
spanish
horses
from
the
westward
just
arrived
in
town
he
added
and
i
shall
be
pleased
to
go
with
you
to
the
place
where
they
are
sold
i
shall
not
presume
to
advise
a
kentuckian
on
such
a
the
horses
were
crowded
together
under
a
dirty
shed
near
the
levee
and
the
vessel
from
which
they
had
been
landed
rode
at
anchor
in
the
river
they
were
the
scrawny
tough
ponies
of
the
plains
reasonably
cheap
and
it
took
no
great
discernment
on
my
part
to
choose
three
of
the
strongest
and
most
intelligent
looking
we
went
next
to
a
saddler
s
where
i
selected
three
saddles
and
bridles
of
spanish
workmanship
and
clark
agreed
to
have
two
of
his
servants
meet
us
with
the
horses
before
madame
bouvet
s
within
the
hour
he
begged
that
we
would
dine
with
him
when
we
returned
from
les
îles
you
will
not
find
an
island
ritchie
he
said
s
plantation
is
a
huge
block
of
land
between
the
river
and
a
cypress
swamp
behind
is
a
man
with
a
wonderful
quality
of
mind
who
might
like
his
ancestors
have
made
his
mark
if
necessity
had
probed
him
or
opportunity
offered
he
never
forgave
the
spanish
government
for
the
murder
of
his
father
nor
do
i
blame
him
he
has
his
troubles
his
son
is
an
incurable
rake
and
degenerate
as
you
may
have
i
went
back
to
madame
bouvet
s
to
find
nick
emerging
from
his
toilet
what
deviltry
have
you
been
up
to
davy
he
demanded
i
have
been
to
the
house
of
the
lions
to
see
your
divinity
i
answered
and
in
a
very
little
while
horses
will
be
here
to
carry
us
to
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
grasping
me
by
both
shoulders
i
mean
that
we
are
going
to
her
father
s
plantation
some
way
down
the
on
my
honor
davy
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
so
much
enterprise
he
cried
and
her
husband
does
not
exist
i
replied
perhaps
after
all
i
might
be
able
to
give
you
instruction
in
the
conduct
of
an
adventure
the
man
you
chased
with
such
futility
was
her
brother
and
he
stole
from
her
the
miniature
of
which
i
am
now
the
fortunate
he
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
in
rueful
amazement
and
her
name
he
demanded
antoinette
de
i
answered
our
letter
is
to
her
he
made
me
a
rueful
bow
i
fear
that
i
have
undervalued
you
ritchie
he
said
you
have
no
peer
i
am
unworthy
to
accompany
you
and
furthermore
it
would
be
and
why
useless
i
inquired
laughing
you
have
doubtless
seen
the
lady
and
she
is
yours
said
he
you
forget
that
i
am
in
love
with
a
miniature
i
said
in
half
an
hour
we
were
packed
and
ready
the
horses
had
arrived
we
bade
to
madame
bouvet
and
rode
down
the
miry
street
until
we
reached
the
road
behind
the
levee
turning
southward
we
soon
left
behind
the
shaded
esplanade
and
the
city
s
roofs
below
us
and
came
to
the
first
of
the
plantation
houses
set
back
amidst
the
dark
foliage
no
tremor
shook
the
fringe
of
moss
that
hung
from
the
heavy
boughs
so
still
was
the
day
and
an
indefinable
milky
haze
stretched
between
us
and
the
cloudless
sky
above
the
sun
s
rays
pierced
it
and
gathered
fire
the
mighty
river
beside
us
rolled
listless
and
sullen
flinging
back
the
heat
defiantly
and
on
our
left
was
a
tropical
forest
in
all
its
bewildering
luxuriance
the
the
hackberry
the
myrtle
the
spanish
bayonet
in
bristling
groups
and
the
shaded
places
gave
out
a
scented
moisture
like
an
orangery
anon
we
passed
fields
of
corn
and
cotton
swamps
of
rice
stretches
of
indigo
plants
gnawed
to
the
stem
by
the
pest
our
ponies
ambled
on
unmindful
but
nick
vowed
that
no
woman
under
heaven
would
induce
him
to
undertake
such
a
journey
again
some
three
miles
out
of
the
city
we
descried
two
figures
on
horseback
coming
towards
us
and
quickly
perceived
that
one
was
a
gentleman
the
other
his
black
servant
they
were
riding
at
a
more
rapid
pace
than
the
day
warranted
but
the
gentleman
reined
in
his
sweating
horse
as
he
drew
near
to
us
eyed
us
with
a
curiosity
tempered
by
courtesy
bowed
gravely
and
put
his
horse
to
a
canter
again
phew
said
nick
twisting
in
his
saddle
i
thought
that
all
creoles
were
we
have
met
the
exception
perhaps
i
answered
did
you
take
in
that
man
his
looks
were
a
little
remarkable
come
to
think
of
it
answered
nick
settling
down
into
his
saddle
again
indeed
the
man
s
face
had
struck
me
so
forcibly
that
i
was
surprised
out
of
an
inquiry
which
i
had
meant
to
make
of
him
namely
how
far
we
were
from
the
plantation
we
pursued
our
way
slowly
from
time
to
time
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
dwelling
almost
hid
in
the
distant
foliage
until
at
length
we
came
to
a
place
a
little
more
pretentious
than
those
which
we
had
seen
from
the
road
a
graceful
flight
of
wooden
steps
climbed
the
levee
and
descended
on
the
far
side
to
a
boat
landing
and
a
straight
vista
cut
through
the
grove
lined
by
wild
orange
trees
disclosed
the
white
pillars
and
galleries
of
a
plantation
house
the
grassy
path
leading
through
the
vista
was
trimly
kept
and
on
either
side
of
it
in
the
moist
green
shade
of
the
great
trees
flowers
bloomed
in
a
profusion
of
startling
colors
in
splotches
of
scarlet
and
white
and
royal
purple
nick
slipped
from
his
horse
behold
the
mansion
of
mademoiselle
de
said
he
waving
his
hand
up
the
vista
how
do
you
know
i
asked
i
am
told
by
a
part
of
me
that
never
lies
davy
he
answered
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
besides
he
added
i
should
dislike
devilishly
to
go
too
far
on
such
a
day
and
have
to
come
back
we
will
rest
here
i
said
laughing
and
send
in
benjy
to
find
davy
he
answered
with
withering
contempt
you
have
no
more
romance
in
you
than
a
turnip
we
will
go
ourselves
and
see
what
very
well
then
i
answered
falling
in
with
his
humor
we
will
go
he
brushed
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
gave
himself
a
pull
here
and
a
pat
there
and
led
the
way
down
the
alley
but
we
had
not
gone
far
before
he
turned
into
a
path
that
entered
the
grove
on
the
right
and
to
this
likewise
i
made
no
protest
we
soon
found
ourselves
in
a
heavenly
spot
sheltered
from
the
sun
s
rays
by
a
dense
verdure
and
no
one
who
has
not
visited
these
southern
country
places
can
know
the
teeming
fragrance
there
one
shrub
how
well
i
recall
it
was
like
unto
the
perfume
of
all
the
flowers
and
all
the
fruits
the
very
essence
of
the
delicious
languor
of
the
place
that
made
our
steps
to
falter
a
bird
shot
a
bright
flame
of
color
through
the
checkered
light
ahead
of
us
suddenly
a
sound
brought
us
to
a
halt
and
we
stood
in
a
tense
and
wondering
silence
the
words
of
a
song
sung
carelessly
in
a
clear
girlish
voice
came
to
us
from
beyond
je
voudrais
bien
me
marier
je
voudrais
bien
me
marier
mais
j
ai
qrand
peur
de
me
tromper
mais
j
ai
grand
peur
de
me
tromper
ils
sont
si
malhonnêtes
ma
luron
ma
lurette
ils
sont
si
malhonnêtes
ma
luron
ma
we
have
come
at
the
very
zenith
of
opportunity
i
whispered
hush
he
said
je
ne
veux
pas
d
un
avocat
je
ne
veux
pas
d
un
avocat
car
ils
aiment
trop
les
ducats
car
ils
aiment
trop
les
ducats
ils
trompent
les
fillettes
ma
luron
ma
lurette
ils
trompent
les
fillettes
ma
luron
ma
eliminating
ritchie
i
believe
said
nick
turning
on
me
with
a
grimace
but
hark
again
je
voudrais
bien
d
un
officier
je
voudrais
bien
d
un
officier
je
marcherais
a
pas
cárres
je
marcherais
a

dans
ma

ma
luron
ma

dans
ma
joli
chambrette
ma
luron
ma
the
song
ceased
with
a
sound
that
was
half
laughter
half
sigh
before
i
realized
what
he
was
doing
nick
instead
of
retracing
his
steps
towards
the
house
started
forward
the
path
led
through
a
dense
thicket
which
became
a
casino
hedge
and
suddenly
i
found
myself
peering
over
his
shoulder
into
a
little
garden
bewildering
in
color
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
a
great
spread
its
sheltering
branches
around
the
gnarled
trunk
was
a
seat
and
on
the
seat
her
sewing
fallen
into
her
lap
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
staring
wide
sat
the
young
lady
whom
we
had
seen
on
the
levee
the
evening
before
and
nick
was
making
a
bow
in
his
grandest
manner
hélas
mademoiselle
he
said
je
ne
suis
pas
officier
mais
on
peut
arranger
tout
cela
sans
my
breath
was
taken
away
by
this
audacity
and
i
braced
myself
against
screams
flight
and
other
feminine
demonstrations
of
terror
the
young
lady
did
nothing
of
the
kind
she
turned
her
back
to
us
leaned
against
the
tree
and
to
my
astonishment
i
saw
her
slim
shoulders
shaken
with
laughter
at
length
very
slowly
she
looked
around
and
in
her
face
struggled
curiosity
and
fear
and
merriment
nick
made
another
bow
worthy
of
versailles
and
she
gave
a
frightened
little
laugh
you
are
english
messieurs
yes
she
ventured
we
were
once
cried
nick
but
we
have
changed
et
quoi
donc
relapsing
into
her
own
language
americans
said
he
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
honorable
david
ritchie
whom
you
rejected
a
few
moments
whom
i
rejected
she
exclaimed
alas
said
nick
with
a
commiserating
glance
at
me
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
a
mademoiselle
shot
at
me
the
swiftest
and
shyest
of
glances
and
turned
to
us
once
more
her
quivering
shoulders
there
was
a
brief
silence
mademoiselle
said
nick
taking
a
step
on
the
garden
path
monsieur
she
answered
without
so
much
as
looking
around
what
now
would
you
take
this
gentleman
to
be
he
asked
with
an
insistence
not
to
be
denied
again
she
was
shaken
with
laughter
and
suddenly
to
my
surprise
she
turned
and
looked
full
at
me
in
english
monsieur
you
call
it
a
gallant
my
face
fairly
tingled
and
i
heard
nick
laughing
with
unseemly
merriment
ah
mademoiselle
he
cried
you
are
a
judge
of
character
and
you
have
read
him
then
i
must
leave
you
messieurs
she
answered
with
her
eyes
in
her
lap
but
she
made
no
move
to
go
you
need
have
no
fear
of
ritchie
mademoiselle
answered
nick
instantly
i
am
here
to
protect
you
against
his
this
time
nick
received
the
glance
and
quailed
before
it
and
who
par
exemple
is
to
protect
me
against
you
monsieur
she
asked
in
the
lowest
of
voices
you
forget
that
i
too
am
unprotected
and
vulnerable
mademoiselle
he
answered
her
face
was
hidden
again
but
not
for
long
how
did
you
come
she
demanded
presently
on
air
he
answered
for
we
saw
you
in
new
orleans
and
why
need
you
ask
mademoiselle
said
the
rogue
and
then
with
more
effrontery
than
ever
he
began
to
sing
je
voudrais
bien
me
marier
je
voudrais
bien
me
marier
mais
j
ai
grand
peur
de
me
she
rose
her
sewing
falling
to
the
ground
and
took
a
few
startled
steps
towards
us
monsieur
you
will
be
heard
she
cried
and
put
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
said
nick
i
must
leave
you
she
said
with
the
quaintest
of
english
pronunciation
yet
she
stood
irresolute
in
the
garden
path
a
picture
against
the
dark
green
leaves
and
the
flowers
her
age
might
have
been
seventeen
her
gown
was
of
some
soft
and
light
material
printed
in
buds
of
delicate
color
her
slim
arms
bare
above
the
elbow
she
had
the
ivory
complexion
of
the
province
more
delicate
than
i
had
yet
seen
and
beyond
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
her
save
to
add
that
she
was
such
a
strange
mixture
of
innocence
and
ingenuousness
and
coquetry
as
i
had
not
imagined
presently
her
gaze
was
fixed
seriously
on
me
do
you
think
it
very
wrong
monsieur
she
asked
i
was
more
than
taken
aback
by
this
tribute
oh
cried
nick
the
arbiter
of
etiquette
since
i
am
here
mademoiselle
i
answered
with
anything
but
readiness
i
am
not
a
proper
her
next
question
staggered
me
you
are
she
asked
mr
ritchie
s
grandfather
was
a
scottish
earl
said
nick
immediately
a
piece
of
news
that
startled
me
into
protest
it
is
true
davy
though
you
may
not
know
it
he
added
and
you
monsieur
she
said
to
nick
i
am
his
cousin
is
it
not
honor
enough
said
he
yet
you
do
not
resemble
one
mr
ritchie
has
all
the
good
looks
in
the
family
said
nick
oh
cried
the
young
lady
and
this
time
she
gave
us
her
profile
come
mademoiselle
said
nick
since
the
fates
have
cast
the
die
let
us
all
sit
down
in
the
shade
the
place
was
made
for
monsieur
she
cried
giving
back
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
alone
with
but
ritchie
is
a
duenna
to
satisfy
the
most
exacting
said
nick
when
you
know
him
better
you
will
believe
she
laughed
softly
and
glanced
at
me
by
this
time
we
were
all
three
under
the
branches
monsieur
you
do
not
understand
the
french
customs
mon
dieu
if
the
good
sister
lorette
could
see
me
now
but
she
is
safe
in
the
convent
said
nick
are
they
going
to
put
glass
on
the
walls
and
why
asked
mademoiselle
innocently
because
said
nick
because
a
very
bad
man
has
come
to
new
orleans
one
who
is
given
to
climbing
you
yes
but
when
i
found
that
a
certain
demoiselle
had
left
the
convent
i
was
no
longer
anxious
to
climb
and
how
did
you
know
that
i
had
left
it
i
was
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
this
were
coquetry
or
innocence
because
i
saw
you
on
the
levee
said
nick
you
saw
me
on
the
levee
she
repeated
giving
back
and
i
had
a
great
fear
the
rogue
persisted
a
fear
of
what
a
fear
that
you
were
married
he
said
with
a
boldness
that
made
me
blush
as
for
mademoiselle
a
color
that
vied
with
the
june
roses
charged
through
her
cheeks
she
stooped
to
pick
up
her
sewing
but
nick
was
before
her
and
why
did
you
think
me
married
she
asked
in
a
voice
so
low
that
we
scarcely
heard
faith
said
nick
because
you
seemed
to
be
quarrelling
with
a
she
turned
to
him
with
an
irresistible
seriousness
and
is
that
your
idea
of
marriage
monsieur
this
time
it
was
i
who
laughed
for
he
had
been
hit
very
fairly
mademoiselle
said
he
i
did
not
for
a
moment
think
it
could
have
been
a
love
mademoiselle
turned
away
and
laughed
you
are
the
very
strangest
man
i
have
ever
seen
she
said
shall
i
give
you
my
notion
of
a
love
match
mademoiselle
said
nick
i
should
think
you
might
be
well
versed
in
the
subject
monsieur
she
answered
speaking
to
the
tree
but
here
is
scarcely
the
time
and
she
wound
up
her
sewing
and
faced
him
i
must
really
leave
you
she
said
he
took
a
step
towards
her
and
stood
looking
down
into
her
face
her
eyes
dropped
and
am
i
never
to
see
you
again
he
asked
monsieur
she
cried
softly
i
do
not
know
who
you
she
made
him
a
courtesy
took
a
few
steps
in
the
opposite
path
and
turned
that
depends
upon
your
ingenuity
she
added
you
seem
to
have
no
lack
of
it
nick
was
transported
you
must
not
go
he
cried
must
not
how
dare
you
speak
to
me
thus
monsieur
then
she
tempered
it
there
is
a
lady
here
whom
i
love
and
who
is
ill
i
must
not
be
long
from
her
she
is
very
ill
said
nick
probably
for
want
of
something
better
she
is
not
really
ill
monsieur
but
depressed
is
not
that
the
word
she
is
a
very
dear
friend
and
she
has
had
trouble
so
much
monsieur
and
my
mother
brought
her
here
we
love
her
as
one
of
the
this
was
certainly
ingenuous
and
it
was
plain
that
the
girl
gave
us
this
story
through
a
certain
nervousness
for
she
twisted
her
sewing
in
her
fingers
as
she
spoke
mademoiselle
said
nick
i
would
not
keep
you
from
such
an
errand
of
she
gave
him
a
grateful
look
more
dangerous
than
any
which
had
gone
before
and
besides
he
went
on
we
have
come
to
stay
awhile
with
you
ritchie
and
you
have
come
to
stay
awhile
she
said
i
thought
it
time
that
the
farce
were
ended
we
have
come
with
letters
to
your
father
monsieur
de
mademoiselle
i
said
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
him
if
he
is
at
mademoiselle
stared
at
me
in
unfeigned
astonishment
but
did
you
not
meet
him
monsieur
she
demanded
he
left
an
hour
ago
for
new
orleans
you
must
have
met
a
gentleman
riding
very
it
was
my
turn
to
be
astonished
but
that
was
not
your
father
i
exclaimed
et
pourquoi
non
she
said
is
not
your
father
the
stout
gentleman
whom
i
saw
with
you
on
the
levee
last
evening
i
asked
she
laughed
you
have
been
observing
monsieur
she
said
that
was
my
uncle
monsieur
de
beauséjour
you
saw
me
quarrelling
with
my
brother
auguste
she
went
on
a
little
excitedly
oh
i
am
very
much
ashamed
of
it
i
was
so
angry
my
cousin
mademoiselle
hélène
de
has
just
sent
me
from
france
such
a
beautiful
miniature
and
auguste
fell
in
love
with
fell
in
love
with
it
i
exclaimed
involuntarily
you
should
see
it
monsieur
and
i
think
you
also
would
fall
in
love
with
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
nick
mademoiselle
made
the
faintest
of
moues
auguste
is
very
wild
as
you
say
she
continued
addressing
me
he
is
a
great
care
to
my
father
he
intrigues
you
know
he
wishes
louisiane
to
become
french
once
more
as
we
all
do
but
i
should
not
say
this
monsieur
she
added
in
a
startled
tone
you
will
not
tell
no
i
know
you
will
not
we
do
not
like
the
spaniards
they
killed
my
grandfather
when
they
came
to
take
the
province
and
once
the
miro
sent
for
my
father
and
declared
he
would
put
auguste
in
prison
if
he
did
not
behave
himself
but
i
have
forgotten
the
miniature
when
auguste
saw
that
he
fell
in
love
with
it
and
now
he
wishes
to
go
to
france
and
obtain
a
commission
through
our
cousin
the
marquis
of
and
marry
mademoiselle
a
comprehensive
programme
indeed
said
nick
my
father
has
gone
back
to
new
orleans
she
said
to
get
the
miniature
from
auguste
he
took
it
from
me
she
raised
her
head
a
little
proudly
if
my
brother
had
asked
it
i
might
have
given
it
to
him
though
i
treasured
it
but
auguste
is
so
impulsive
my
uncle
told
my
father
who
is
very
angry
he
will
punish
auguste
severely
and
i
do
not
like
to
have
him
punished
oh
i
wish
i
had
the
your
wish
is
granted
mademoiselle
i
answered
drawing
the
case
from
my
pocket
and
handing
it
to
her
she
took
it
staring
at
me
with
eyes
wide
with
wonder
and
then
she
opened
it
mechanically
monsieur
she
said
with
great
dignity
do
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
obtained
this
i
found
it
mademoiselle
i
answered
and
as
i
spoke
i
felt
nick
s
fingers
on
my
arm
you
found
it
where
how
monsieur
at
madame
bouvet
s
the
house
where
we
oh
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
must
have
dropped
it
it
is
there
where
he
meets
his
associates
where
they
talk
of
the
french
again
i
felt
nick
pinching
me
and
i
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
mademoiselle
was
about
to
continue
but
i
interrupted
her
how
long
will
your
father
be
in
new
orleans
mademoiselle
i
asked
until
he
finds
auguste
she
answered
it
may
be
days
but
he
will
stay
for
he
is
very
angry
but
will
you
not
come
into
the
house
messieurs
and
be
presented
to
my
mother
she
asked
i
have
been
very
inhospitable
she
added
with
a
glance
at
nick
we
followed
her
through
winding
paths
bordered
by
shrubs
and
flowers
and
presently
came
to
a
low
house
surrounded
by
a
wide
cool
gallery
and
shaded
by
spreading
trees
behind
it
were
clustered
the
kitchens
and
quarters
of
the
house
servants
mademoiselle
picking
up
her
dress
ran
up
the
steps
ahead
of
us
and
turned
to
the
left
in
the
hall
into
a
darkened
parlor
the
floor
was
bare
save
for
a
few
mats
and
in
the
corner
was
a
massive
escritoire
of
mahogany
with
carved
feet
and
there
were
tables
and
chairs
of
a
like
pattern
it
was
a
room
of
more
distinction
than
i
had
seen
since
i
had
been
in
charlestown
and
reflected
the
solidity
of
its
owners
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
wait
here
messieurs
said
mademoiselle
i
will
call
my
and
she
left
us
i
sat
down
rather
uncomfortably
but
nick
took
a
stand
and
stood
staring
down
at
me
with
folded
arms
how
i
have
undervalued
you
davy
he
said
i
am
not
proud
of
it
i
answered
shortly
what
the
deuce
is
to
do
now
he
asked
i
can
not
linger
here
i
answered
i
have
business
with
monsieur
de
and
i
must
go
back
to
new
orleans
at
then
i
will
wait
for
you
said
nick
davy
i
have
met
my
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
heard
that
remark
before
i
answered
he
had
not
time
to
protest
for
we
heard
footsteps
in
the
hall
and
mademoiselle
entered
leading
an
older
lady
by
the
hand
in
the
light
of
the
doorway
i
saw
that
she
was
thin
and
small
and
yellow
but
her
features
had
a
regularity
and
her
mien
a
dignity
which
made
her
impressing
which
would
have
convinced
a
stranger
that
she
was
a
person
of
birth
and
breeding
her
hair
tinged
with
gray
was
crowned
by
a
lace
cap
madame
i
said
bowing
and
coming
forward
i
am
david
ritchie
from
kentucky
and
this
is
my
cousin
temple
of
charlestown
monsieur
gratiot
and
colonel
chouteau
of
louis
have
been
kind
enough
to
give
us
letters
to
monsieur
de
and
i
handed
her
one
of
the
letters
which
i
had
ready
you
are
very
welcome
messieurs
she
answered
with
the
same
delightful
accent
which
her
daughter
had
used
and
you
are
especially
welcome
from
such
a
source
the
friends
of
colonel
chouteau
and
of
monsieur
gratiot
are
our
friends
you
will
remain
with
us
i
hope
messieurs
she
continued
monsieur
de
will
return
in
a
few
days
at
by
your
leave
madame
i
will
go
to
new
orleans
at
once
and
try
to
find
monsieur
i
said
for
i
have
business
with
you
will
return
with
him
i
hope
said
madame
i
bowed
and
temple
will
remain
she
asked
with
a
questioning
look
at
nick
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
madame
he
answered
and
there
was
no
mistaking
his
sincerity
as
he
spoke
mademoiselle
turned
her
back
on
him
i
would
not
wait
for
dinner
but
pausing
only
for
a
sip
of
cool
madeira
and
some
other
refreshment
i
made
my
farewells
to
the
ladies
as
i
started
out
of
the
door
to
find
benjy
who
had
been
waiting
for
more
than
an
hour
mademoiselle
gave
me
a
neatly
folded
note
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
present
that
to
my
father
monsieur
she
said
chapter
xiii
monsieur
auguste
entrapped
it
may
be
well
to
declare
here
and
now
that
i
do
not
intend
to
burden
this
story
with
the
business
which
had
brought
me
to
new
orleans
while
in
the
city
during
the
next
few
days
i
met
a
young
gentleman
named
daniel
clark
a
nephew
of
that
clark
of
whom
i
have
spoken
many
years
after
the
time
of
which
i
write
this
daniel
clark
the
younger
who
became
a
rich
merchant
and
an
able
man
of
affairs
published
a
book
which
sets
forth
with
great
clearness
proofs
of
general
wilkinson
s
duplicity
and
treason
and
these
may
be
read
by
any
who
would
satisfy
himself
further
on
the
subject
wharton
had
not
believed
nor
had
i
flattered
myself
that
i
should
be
able
to
bring
such
a
fox
as
general
wilkinson
to
earth
abundant
circumstantial
evidence
i
obtained
wilkinson
s
intimacy
with
miro
was
well
known
and
i
likewise
learned
that
a
cipher
existed
between
them
the
permit
to
trade
given
by
miro
to
wilkinson
was
made
no
secret
of
in
brief
i
may
say
that
i
discovered
as
much
as
could
be
discovered
by
any
one
without
arousing
suspicion
and
that
the
information
with
which
i
returned
to
kentucky
was
of
some
material
value
to
my
employers
i
have
to
thank
monsieur
philippe
de
gré
for
a
great
deal
and
i
take
this
opportunity
to
set
down
the
fact
that
i
have
rarely
met
a
more
remarkable
man
as
i
rode
back
to
town
alone
a
whitish
film
was
spread
before
the
sun
and
ere
i
had
come
in
sight
of
the
fortifications
the
low
forest
on
the
western
bank
was
a
dark
green
blur
against
the
sky
the
esplanade
on
the
levee
was
deserted
the
willow
trees
had
a
mournful
look
while
the
bright
tiles
of
yesterday
seemed
to
have
faded
to
a
sombre
tone
i
spied
xavier
on
a
bench
smoking
with
some
friends
of
his
he
make
much
rain
soon
michié
he
cried
you
hev
good
time
i
hope
i
waved
my
hand
and
rode
on
past
the
place
d
armes
with
its
white
diagonal
bands
strapping
its
green
like
a
soldier
s
front
and
as
i
drew
up
before
the
gate
of
the
house
of
the
lions
the
warning
taps
of
the
storm
were
drumming
on
the
magnolia
leaves
the
same
gardienne
came
to
my
knock
and
in
answer
to
her
shrill
cry
a
negro
lad
appeared
to
hold
my
horse
i
was
ushered
into
a
archway
that
ran
under
the
latticed
gallery
toward
a
but
ere
we
reached
this
the
gardienne
turned
to
the
left
up
a
flight
of
steps
with
a
delicate
balustrade
which
led
to
an
open
gallery
above
and
there
stood
the
gentleman
whom
we
had
met
hurrying
to
town
in
the
morning
a
gentleman
he
was
every
inch
of
him
he
was
dressed
in
black
silk
his
hair
in
a
cue
and
drawn
away
from
a
face
of
remarkable
features
he
had
a
nose
a
black
eye
that
held
an
inquiring
sternness
a
chin
indented
and
a
receding
forehead
his
stature
was
indeterminable
in
brief
he
might
have
stood
for
one
of
those
persons
of
birth
and
ability
who
become
prime
ministers
of
france
monsieur
de
gré
i
said
he
bowed
gracefully
but
with
a
tinge
of
condescension
i
was
awed
and
considering
the
relations
which
i
had
already
had
with
his
family
i
must
admit
that
i
was
somewhat
frightened
monsieur
i
said
i
bring
letters
to
you
from
monsieur
gratiot
and
colonel
chouteau
of
louis
one
of
these
i
had
the
honor
to
deliver
to
madame
de
gré
and
here
is
the
ah
he
said
with
another
keen
glance
i
met
you
this
morning
did
i
not
you
did
he
broke
the
seal
and
going
to
the
edge
of
the
gallery
held
the
letter
to
the
light
as
he
read
a
peal
of
thunder
broke
distantly
the
rain
came
down
in
a
flood
then
he
folded
the
paper
carefully
and
turned
to
me
again
you
will
make
my
house
your
home
ritchie
he
said
recommended
from
such
a
source
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
serve
you
but
where
is
this
temple
of
whom
the
letter
speaks
his
family
in
charlestown
is
known
to
me
by
by
madame
de
gré
s
invitation
he
remained
at
les
îles
i
answered
speaking
above
the
roar
of
the
rain
i
was
just
going
to
the
table
said
monsieur
de
gré
we
will
talk
as
we
he
led
the
way
into
the
dining
room
and
as
i
stood
on
the
threshold
a
bolt
of
great
brilliancy
lighted
its
floor
and
walnut
furniture
of
a
staid
pattern
a
deafening
crash
followed
as
we
took
our
seats
while
monsieur
de
gré
s
man
lighted
four
candles
of
green
wax
monsieur
gratiot
s
letter
speaks
vaguely
of
politics
ritchie
began
monsieur
de
gré
he
spoke
english
perfectly
save
for
an
occasional
harsh
aspiration
which
i
can
not
imitate
directing
his
man
to
fetch
a
certain
kind
of
madeira
he
turned
to
me
with
a
look
of
polite
inquiry
which
was
scarcely
reassuring
and
i
reflected
the
caution
with
which
i
had
been
endowed
coming
uppermost
that
the
man
might
have
changed
since
monsieur
gratiot
had
seen
him
he
had
moreover
the
air
of
a
man
who
gives
a
forced
attention
which
seemed
to
me
the
natural
consequences
of
the
recent
actions
of
his
son
i
fear
that
i
am
intruding
upon
your
affairs
monsieur
i
answered
not
at
all
sir
he
said
politely
i
have
met
that
charming
gentleman
wilkinson
who
came
here
to
brush
away
the
causes
of
dissension
and
cement
a
friendship
between
kentucky
and
it
was
most
fortunate
that
the
note
of
irony
did
not
escape
me
where
governments
failed
general
wilkinson
succeeded
i
answered
dryly
monsieur
de
gré
glanced
at
me
and
an
enigmatical
smile
spread
over
his
face
i
knew
then
that
the
ice
was
cracked
between
us
yet
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
not
to
make
one
more
tentative
remark
a
union
between
kentucky
and
louisiana
would
be
a
resistless
force
in
the
world
ritchie
he
said
it
was
nebuchadnezzar
who
dreamed
of
a
composite
image
monsieur
i
answered
and
wilkinson
forgets
one
thing
that
kentucky
is
a
part
of
the
united
at
that
monsieur
gré
laughed
outright
he
became
a
different
man
though
he
lost
none
of
his
dignity
i
should
have
had
more
faith
in
my
old
friend
gratiot
he
said
but
you
will
pardon
me
if
i
did
not
recognize
at
once
the
statesman
he
had
sent
me
it
was
my
turn
to
laugh
monsieur
he
went
on
returning
to
that
dignity
of
mien
which
marked
him
my
political
opinions
are
too
well
known
that
i
should
make
a
mystery
of
them
to
you
i
was
born
a
frenchman
i
shall
die
a
frenchman
and
i
shall
never
be
happy
until
louisiana
is
french
once
more
my
a
brother
of
the
marquis
de
gré
of
that
time
and
a
wild
blade
enough
came
out
with
d
iberville
his
son
my
grandfather
was
the
of
the
colony
under
the
marquis
de
vaudreuil
he
sent
me
to
france
for
my
education
where
i
was
introduced
at
court
by
my
kinsman
the
old
marquis
who
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
begged
me
to
remain
it
was
my
father
s
wish
that
i
should
return
and
i
did
not
disobey
him
i
had
scarcely
come
back
monsieur
when
that
abominable
secret
bargain
of
louis
the
fifteenth
became
known
ceding
louisiana
to
spain
you
may
have
heard
of
the
revolution
which
followed
here
it
was
a
mild
affair
and
the
remembrance
of
it
makes
me
smile
to
this
day
though
with
bitterness
i
was
five
and
twenty
and
french
que
and
monsieur
de
gré
shrugged
his
shoulders
o
reilly
the
famous
spanish
general
came
with
his
well
i
remember
the
days
we
waited
with
leaden
hearts
for
the
to
come
up
from
the
english
turn
and
i
can
see
now
the
cannon
frowning
from
the
ports
the
grim
spars
the
high
poops
crowded
with
officers
the
great
anchors
splashing
the
yellow
water
i
can
hear
the
chains
running
the
ships
were
in
line
of
battle
before
the
town
their
flying
bridges
swung
to
the
levee
and
they
loomed
above
us
like
towering
fortresses
it
was
dark
monsieur
such
as
this
afternoon
and
we
poor
french
colonists
stood
huddled
in
the
open
space
below
waiting
for
we
knew
not
he
paused
and
i
started
for
the
picture
he
drew
had
carried
me
out
of
myself
on
the
of
august
well
i
remember
the
day
monsieur
de
gré
continued
the
spanish
troops
landed
late
in
the
afternoon
hundred
strong
the
artillery
rumbling
over
the
bridges
the
horses
wheeling
and
rearing
and
they
drew
up
as
in
line
of
battle
in
the
place
d
armes
dragoons
fusileros
de
montañas
light
and
heavy
infantry
where
were
our
white
cockades
then
fifty
guns
shook
the
town
the
great
o
reilly
limped
ashore
through
the
smoke
and
louisiana
was
lost
to
france
we
had
a
cowardly
governor
monsieur
whose
name
is
written
in
the
annals
of
the
province
in
letters
of
shame
he
betrayed
monsieur
de
gré
and
others
into
o
reilly
s
hands
and
when
my
father
was
cast
into
prison
he
was
seized
with
such
a
fit
of
anger
that
he
monsieur
de
gré
was
silent
without
under
the
eaves
of
the
gallery
a
white
rain
fell
and
a
steaming
moisture
arose
from
the
what
i
have
told
you
monsieur
is
common
knowledge
louisiana
has
been
spanish
for
twenty
years
i
no
longer
wear
the
white
cockade
for
i
am
older
he
smiled
strange
things
are
happening
in
france
and
the
old
order
to
which
i
belong
he
straightened
perceptibly
seems
to
be
tottering
i
have
ceased
to
intrigue
but
thank
god
i
have
not
ceased
to
pray
perhaps
who
knows
perhaps
i
may
live
to
see
again
the
lily
of
france
stirred
by
the
river
he
fell
into
a
revery
his
fine
head
bent
a
little
but
presently
aroused
himself
and
eyed
me
curiously
i
need
not
say
that
i
felt
a
strange
liking
for
monsieur
de
gré
and
now
ritchie
he
said
will
you
tell
me
who
you
are
and
how
i
can
serve
you
the
servant
had
put
the
coffee
on
the
table
and
left
the
room
monsieur
de
gré
himself
poured
me
a
cup
from
the
dainty
quaintly
wrought
louis
quinze
coffeepot
graven
with
the
coat
of
arms
of
his
family
as
we
sat
talking
my
admiration
for
my
host
increased
for
i
found
that
he
was
familiar
not
only
with
the
situation
in
kentucky
but
that
he
also
knew
far
more
than
i
of
the
principles
and
personnel
of
the
new
government
of
which
general
washington
was
president
that
he
had
little
sympathy
with
government
by
the
people
was
natural
for
he
was
a
creole
and
behind
that
a
member
of
an
order
which
detested
republics
when
we
were
got
beyond
these
topics
the
rain
had
ceased
the
night
had
fallen
the
green
candles
had
burned
low
and
suddenly
as
he
spoke
of
les
îsles
i
remembered
the
note
mademoiselle
had
given
me
for
him
and
i
apologized
for
my
forgetfulness
he
read
it
and
dropped
it
with
an
exclamation
my
daughter
tells
me
that
you
have
returned
to
her
a
miniature
which
she
lost
monsieur
he
said
i
had
that
pleasure
i
answered
and
that
you
found
this
miniature
at
madame
bouvet
s
was
this
the
case
and
he
stared
hard
at
me
i
nodded
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
speak
it
seemed
an
outrage
to
lie
to
such
a
man
he
did
not
answer
but
sat
lost
in
thought
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
the
tables
until
the
noise
of
the
slamming
of
a
door
aroused
him
to
a
listening
posture
the
sound
of
subdued
voices
came
from
the
archway
below
us
and
one
of
these
from
an
occasional
excited
and
feminine
note
i
thought
to
be
the
gardienne
s
monsieur
de
gré
thrust
back
his
chair
and
in
three
strides
was
at
the
edge
of
the
gallery
auguste
he
cried
silence
auguste
come
up
to
me
at
once
he
said
in
french
another
silence
then
something
that
sounded
like
sapristi
a
groan
from
the
gardienne
and
a
step
was
heard
on
the
stairway
my
own
discomfort
increased
and
i
would
have
given
much
to
be
in
any
other
place
in
the
world
auguste
had
arrived
at
the
head
of
the
steps
but
was
apparently
unable
to
get
any
farther
bon
soir
mon
père
he
said
like
a
dutiful
son
said
monsieur
de
gré
you
heard
i
was
in
town
and
called
to
pay
your
respects
i
am
sure
i
am
delighted
to
find
you
in
fact
i
came
to
town
for
that
lisette
began
auguste
thought
that
i
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
no
doubt
said
his
father
walk
in
monsieur
auguste
s
slim
figure
appeared
in
the
doorway
he
caught
sight
of
me
halted
backed
and
stood
staring
with
widened
eyes
the
candles
threw
their
light
across
his
shoulder
on
the
face
of
the
elder
monsieur
de
gré
auguste
was
a
replica
of
his
father
with
the
features
minimized
to
regularity
and
the
brow
narrowed
the
complexion
of
the
one
was
a
clear
saffron
while
the
boy
s
skin
was
mottled
and
he
was
not
twenty
what
is
the
matter
said
monsieur
de
gré
you
you
have
a
visitor
stammered
auguste
with
a
tact
that
savored
of
practice
yet
there
was
a
sorry
difference
between
this
and
the
haughty
young
patrician
who
had
sold
me
the
miniature
who
brings
me
good
news
said
monsieur
de
gré
in
english
mr
ritchie
allow
me
to
introduce
my
son
i
felt
monsieur
de
gré
s
eyes
on
me
as
i
bowed
and
i
began
to
think
i
was
in
near
as
great
a
predicament
as
auguste
monsieur
de
gré
was
managing
the
matter
with
infinite
wisdom
sit
down
my
son
he
said
you
have
no
doubt
been
staying
with
your
auguste
sat
down
still
staring
does
your
aunt
s
health
mend
she
is
better
father
said
the
son
in
english
which
might
have
been
improved
i
am
glad
of
it
said
monsieur
de
gré
taking
a
chair
andré
fill
the
the
silent
mulatto
poured
out
the
madeira
shot
a
look
at
auguste
and
retired
softly
there
has
been
a
heavy
rain
monsieur
said
monsieur
de
gré
to
me
but
i
think
the
air
is
not
yet
cleared
i
was
about
to
say
ritchie
when
my
son
called
to
pay
his
respects
that
the
miniature
of
which
we
were
speaking
is
one
of
the
most
remarkable
paintings
i
have
ever
auguste
s
thin
fingers
were
clutching
the
chair
i
have
never
beheld
mademoiselle
hélène
de
gré
for
my
cousin
the
marquis
was
not
married
when
i
left
france
he
was
a
captain
in
a
regiment
of
his
majesty
s
mousquetaires
since
abolished
but
i
am
sure
that
the
likeness
of
mademoiselle
must
be
a
true
one
for
it
has
the
stamp
of
a
remarkable
personality
though
hélène
can
be
only
eighteen
women
with
us
mature
quickly
monsieur
and
this
portrait
tallies
with
what
i
have
heard
of
her
character
you
no
doubt
observed
the
face
monsieur
that
of
a
true
aristocrat
but
i
was
speaking
of
her
character
when
she
was
twelve
she
said
something
to
a
cardinal
for
which
her
mother
made
her
keep
her
room
a
whole
day
for
mademoiselle
would
not
retract
and
pardieu
i
believe
his
eminence
was
wrong
the
marquise
is
afraid
of
her
and
when
first
hélène
was
presented
formally
she
made
such
a
witty
retort
to
the
queen
s
sally
that
her
majesty
insisted
upon
her
coming
to
court
on
every
new
year
s
day
i
have
always
sent
a
present
of
coffee
and
périque
to
my
cousin
the
marquis
and
it
is
mademoiselle
who
writes
to
thank
us
parole
d
honneur
her
letters
make
me
see
again
the
people
amongst
whom
she
moves
the
dukes
and
duchesses
the
cardinals
bishops
and
generals
she
draws
them
to
the
life
monsieur
with
a
touch
that
makes
them
all
ridiculous
his
majesty
does
not
escape
god
forgive
him
he
is
indeed
an
amiable
weak
person
for
calling
a
states
general
and
the
queen
a
frivolous
lady
but
true
to
those
whom
she
loves
and
beginning
now
to
realize
the
perils
of
the
he
paused
is
it
any
wonder
that
auguste
has
fallen
in
love
with
his
cousin
monsieur
that
he
loses
his
head
forgets
that
he
is
a
gentleman
and
steals
her
portrait
from
his
sister
had
i
not
been
so
occupied
with
my
own
fate
in
the
outcome
of
this
inquisition
i
should
have
been
sorry
for
auguste
and
yet
this
feeling
could
not
have
lasted
for
the
young
gentleman
sprang
to
his
feet
cast
a
glance
at
me
which
was
not
without
malignance
and
faced
his
father
his
lips
twitching
with
anger
and
fear
monsieur
de
gré
sat
undisturbed
he
is
so
much
in
love
with
the
portrait
monsieur
that
he
loses
loses
it
cried
auguste
precisely
said
his
father
dryly
for
ritchie
tells
me
he
found
it
at
madame
bouvet
s
was
it
not
monsieur
auguste
looked
at
me
mille
diables
he
said
and
sat
down
again
heavily
mr
ritchie
has
returned
it
to
your
sister
a
service
which
puts
him
heavily
in
our
debt
said
monsieur
de
gré
now
sir
he
added
to
me
rising
you
have
had
a
tiresome
day
i
will
show
you
to
your
room
and
in
the
morning
we
will
begin
our
he
clapped
his
hands
the
silent
mulatto
appeared
with
a
new
candle
and
i
followed
my
host
down
the
gallery
to
a
room
which
he
flung
open
at
the
far
end
a
great
bedstead
was
in
one
corner
and
a
polished
mahogany
dresser
in
the
other
we
have
saved
some
of
our
family
furniture
from
the
fire
ritchie
said
monsieur
de
gré
that
bed
was
brought
from
paris
by
my
father
forty
years
ago
i
hope
you
will
rest
he
set
the
candle
on
the
table
and
as
he
bowed
there
was
a
trace
of
an
enigmatical
smile
about
his
mouth
how
much
he
knew
of
auguste
s
transaction
i
could
not
fathom
but
the
matter
and
the
scarcely
creditable
part
i
had
played
in
it
kept
me
awake
far
into
the
night
i
was
just
falling
into
a
troubled
sleep
when
a
footstep
on
the
gallery
startled
me
back
to
consciousness
it
was
followed
by
a
light
tap
on
the
door
monsieur
reetchie
said
a
voice
it
was
monsieur
auguste
he
was
not
an
imposing
figure
in
his
nightrail
and
by
the
light
of
the
carefully
shaded
candle
he
held
in
his
hand
i
saw
that
he
had
hitherto
deceived
me
in
the
matter
of
his
calves
he
stood
peering
at
me
as
i
lay
under
the
mosquito
bar
how
is
it
i
can
thank
you
monsieur
he
exclaimed
in
a
whisper
by
saying
nothing
monsieur
i
answered
you
are
noble
you
are
generous
and
and
one
day
i
will
give
you
the
money
back
he
added
with
a
burst
of
magniloquence
you
have
behave
very
well
monsieur
and
i
mek
you
my
friend
behol
auguste
de
gré
entirely
at
your
service
he
made
a
sweeping
bow
that
might
have
been
impressive
save
for
the
nightrail
and
sought
my
hand
which
he
grasped
in
a
fold
of
the
mosquito
bar
i
am
overcome
monsieur
i
said
monsieur
reetchie
you
are
my
friend
my
intimate
he
put
an
aspirate
on
the
word
i
go
to
tell
you
one
leetle
secret
i
find
that
i
can
repose
confidence
in
you
my
father
does
not
understan
me
you
saw
monsieur
he
does
not
appreciate
that
is
the
engleesh
mon
dieu
you
saw
it
this
night
i
who
spik
to
you
am
made
for
a
courtier
a
noble
i
have
the
gift
la
louisiane
she
is
not
so
big
enough
for
he
lowered
his
voice
still
further
and
bent
nearer
to
me
monsieur
i
run
away
to
france
my
cousin
the
marquis
will
help
me
you
will
hear
of
auguste
de
gré
at
versailles
at
trianon
at
chantilly
and
it
is
a
worthy
campaign
monsieur
i
interrupted
a
distant
sound
broke
the
stillness
and
auguste
was
near
to
dropping
the
candle
on
me
adieu
monsieur
he
whispered
milles
tonneres
i
have
done
one
extraordinaire
foolish
thing
when
i
am
come
to
this
house
and
he
disappeared
shading
his
candle
as
he
had
come
chapter
xiv
retribution
during
the
next
two
days
i
had
more
evidence
of
monsieur
de
gré
s
ability
and
thanks
to
his
conduct
of
my
campaign
not
the
least
suspicion
of
my
mission
to
new
orleans
got
abroad
certain
gentlemen
were
asked
to
dine
we
called
on
others
and
met
still
others
casually
in
their
haunts
of
business
or
pleasure
i
was
troubled
because
of
the
inconvenience
and
discomfort
to
which
my
host
put
himself
for
new
orleans
in
the
may
be
likened
in
climate
to
the
under
side
of
the
lid
of
a
steam
kettle
but
at
length
on
the
second
evening
after
we
had
supped
on
jambalaya
and
rice
cakes
and
other
dainties
and
the
last
guest
had
gone
my
host
turned
to
me
the
rest
of
the
burrow
is
the
same
ritchie
until
it
comes
to
the
light
and
the
fox
has
crawled
out
of
the
other
end
i
said
precisely
he
answered
laughing
in
short
if
you
were
to
remain
in
new
orleans
until
new
year
s
you
would
not
learn
a
whit
more
morning
i
have
a
little
business
of
my
own
to
transact
and
we
shall
get
to
les
îles
in
time
for
dinner
no
don
t
thank
me
he
protested
there
s
a
certain
rough
honesty
and
earnestness
ingrained
in
you
which
i
like
and
besides
he
added
smiling
you
are
poor
indeed
at
thanking
ritchie
you
could
never
do
it
gracefully
but
if
ever
i
were
in
trouble
i
believe
that
i
might
safely
call
on
the
next
day
was
a
rare
one
for
a
wind
from
somewhere
had
blown
the
moisture
away
a
little
the
shadows
were
clearer
cut
and
by
noon
monsieur
de
gré
and
i
were
walking
our
horses
in
the
shady
road
behind
the
levee
we
were
followed
at
a
respectful
distance
by
andré
monsieur
s
mulatto
and
as
we
rode
my
companion
gave
me
stories
of
the
owners
of
the
different
plantations
we
passed
and
spoke
of
many
events
of
interest
in
the
history
of
the
colony
presently
he
ceased
to
talk
and
rode
in
silence
for
many
minutes
and
then
he
turned
upon
me
suddenly
mr
ritchie
he
said
you
have
seen
my
son
it
may
be
that
in
him
i
am
paying
the
price
of
my
sins
i
have
done
everything
to
set
him
straight
but
in
vain
monsieur
every
son
of
the
grés
has
awakened
sooner
or
later
to
a
sense
of
what
becomes
him
but
auguste
is
a
fool
he
cried
bitterly
a
statement
which
i
could
not
deny
were
it
not
for
my
daughter
antoinette
i
should
be
a
miserable
man
inasmuch
as
he
was
not
a
person
of
confidences
i
felt
the
more
flattered
that
he
should
speak
so
plainly
to
me
and
i
had
a
great
sympathy
for
this
strong
man
who
could
not
help
himself
you
have
observed
antoinette
ritchie
he
continued
she
is
a
strange
mixture
of
wilfulness
and
caprice
and
and
she
has
at
times
a
bit
of
that
wit
which
has
made
our
house
for
generations
the
intimates
i
may
say
of
this
peculiar
pride
of
race
would
have
amused
me
in
another
man
i
found
myself
listening
to
monsieur
de
gré
with
gravity
and
i
did
not
dare
to
reply
that
i
had
had
evidence
of
mademoiselle
s
aptness
of
retort
she
has
been
my
companion
since
she
was
a
child
monsieur
she
has
disobeyed
me
flaunted
me
nursed
me
in
illness
championed
me
behind
my
back
i
have
a
little
book
which
i
have
kept
of
her
sayings
and
doings
which
may
interest
you
monsieur
i
will
show
it
this
indeed
was
a
new
side
of
monsieur
de
gré
and
i
reflected
rather
ruefully
upon
the
unvarnished
truth
of
what
wharton
had
told
me
ay
and
what
colonel
clark
had
emphasized
long
before
it
was
my
fate
never
to
be
treated
as
a
young
man
it
struck
me
that
monsieur
de
gré
had
never
even
considered
me
in
the
light
of
a
possible
suitor
for
his
daughter
s
hand
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
them
monsieur
i
answered
would
you
he
exclaimed
his
face
lighting
up
as
he
glanced
at
me
alas
madame
de
gré
and
i
have
promised
to
go
to
our
neighbors
monsieur
and
madame
bertrand
s
for
but
if
you
have
leisure
we
shall
look
at
it
together
and
not
a
word
of
this
to
my
daughter
monsieur
he
added
apprehensively
she
would
never
forgive
me
she
dislikes
my
talking
of
her
but
at
times
i
can
not
help
it
it
was
only
last
year
that
she
was
very
angry
with
me
and
would
not
speak
to
me
for
days
because
i
boasted
of
her
having
watched
at
the
bedside
of
a
poor
gentleman
who
came
here
and
got
the
fever
you
will
not
tell
her
indeed
i
shall
not
monsieur
i
answered
it
is
strange
he
said
abruptly
it
is
strange
that
this
gentleman
and
his
wife
should
likewise
have
had
letters
to
us
from
monsieur
gratiot
they
came
from
louis
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
to
paris
i
cried
what
was
their
name
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
clive
he
said
clive
i
cried
leaning
towards
him
in
my
saddle
clive
and
what
became
of
them
this
time
he
gave
me
one
of
his
searching
looks
and
it
was
not
unmixed
with
astonishment
why
do
you
ask
monsieur
he
demanded
did
you
know
them
i
must
have
shown
that
i
was
strangely
agitated
for
the
moment
i
could
not
answer
monsieur
gratiot
himself
spoke
of
them
to
me
i
said
after
a
little
he
said
they
were
an
interesting
pardieu
exclaimed
monsieur
de
gré
he
put
it
he
gave
me
another
look
there
was
something
about
them
monsieur
which
i
could
not
fathom
why
were
they
drifting
they
were
people
of
quality
who
had
seen
the
world
who
were
by
no
means
paupers
who
had
no
cause
to
travel
save
a
certain
restlessness
and
while
they
were
awaiting
the
sailing
of
the
packet
for
france
they
came
to
our
house
the
old
one
in
the
rue
bourbon
that
was
burned
i
would
not
speak
ill
of
the
dead
but
clive
i
did
not
like
he
fell
sick
of
the
fever
in
my
house
and
it
was
there
that
antoinette
and
madame
de
gré
took
turns
with
his
wife
in
watching
at
his
bedside
i
could
do
nothing
with
antoinette
monsieur
and
she
would
not
listen
to
my
entreaties
my
prayers
my
commands
we
buried
the
poor
fellow
in
the
alien
ground
for
he
did
not
die
in
the
church
and
after
that
my
daughter
clung
to
clive
she
would
not
let
her
go
and
the
packet
sailed
without
her
i
have
never
seen
such
affection
i
may
say
he
added
quickly
that
madame
de
gré
and
i
share
in
it
for
clive
is
a
lovable
woman
and
a
strong
character
and
into
the
great
sorrow
that
lies
behind
her
life
we
have
never
and
she
is
with
you
now
monsieur
i
asked
she
lives
with
us
monsieur
he
answered
simply
and
i
hope
for
always
no
he
said
quickly
it
is
not
charity
she
has
something
of
her
own
we
love
her
and
she
is
the
best
of
companions
for
my
daughter
for
the
rest
monsieur
she
seems
benumbed
with
no
desire
to
go
back
or
to
go
an
entrance
drive
to
the
plantation
of
les
îles
unknown
to
nick
and
me
led
off
from
the
main
road
like
a
green
tunnel
arched
out
of
the
forest
my
feelings
as
we
entered
this
may
be
imagined
for
i
was
suddenly
confronted
with
the
situation
which
i
had
dreaded
since
my
meeting
with
nick
at
jonesboro
i
could
scarcely
allow
myself
even
the
faint
hope
that
clive
might
not
prove
to
be
temple
after
all
whilst
i
was
in
this
agony
of
doubt
and
indecision
the
drive
suddenly
came
out
on
a
shaded
lawn
dotted
with
flowering
bushes
there
was
the
house
with
its
gallery
its
curved
dormer
roof
and
its
belvedere
and
a
white
girlish
figure
flitted
down
the
steps
it
was
mademoiselle
antoinette
and
no
sooner
had
her
father
dismounted
than
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
forgetful
of
my
presence
he
stood
murmuring
in
her
ear
like
a
lover
and
as
i
watched
them
my
trouble
slipped
from
my
mind
and
gave
place
to
a
vaguer
regret
that
i
had
been
a
wanderer
throughout
my
life
presently
she
turned
up
to
him
a
face
on
which
was
written
something
which
he
could
not
understand
his
own
stronger
features
reflected
a
vague
disquiet
what
is
it
ma
chérie
what
was
it
indeed
something
was
in
her
eyes
which
bore
a
message
and
presentiment
to
me
she
dropped
them
fastening
in
the
lapel
of
his
coat
a
flaunting
red
flower
set
against
a
shining
leaf
and
there
was
a
gentle
joyous
subterfuge
in
her
answer
thou
pardoned
auguste
as
i
commanded
she
said
they
were
speaking
in
the
familiar
french
ha
diable
is
it
that
which
disquiets
thee
said
her
father
we
will
not
speak
of
auguste
dost
thou
know
monsieur
ritchie
toinette
she
disengaged
herself
and
dropped
me
a
courtesy
her
eyes
seeking
the
ground
but
she
said
not
a
word
at
that
instant
madame
de
gré
herself
appeared
on
the
gallery
followed
by
nick
who
came
down
the
steps
with
a
careless
to
greet
the
master
indeed
a
stranger
might
have
thought
that
temple
was
the
host
and
i
saw
antoinette
watching
him
furtively
with
a
gleam
of
amusement
in
her
eyes
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
at
last
monsieur
said
my
cousin
i
am
nicholas
temple
and
i
have
been
your
guest
for
three
had
monsieur
de
gré
been
other
than
the
soul
of
hospitality
it
would
have
been
impossible
not
to
welcome
such
a
guest
our
host
had
in
common
with
his
daughter
a
sense
of
humor
there
was
a
quizzical
expression
on
his
fine
face
as
he
replied
with
the
barest
glance
at
mademoiselle
antoinette
i
trust
you
have
been
well
entertained
temple
my
daughter
has
been
accustomed
only
to
the
society
of
her
brother
and
faith
i
should
not
have
supposed
it
said
nick
instantly
a
remark
which
caused
the
color
to
flush
deeply
into
mademoiselle
s
face
i
looked
to
see
monsieur
de
gré
angry
he
tried
indeed
to
be
grave
but
smiled
irresistibly
as
he
mounted
the
steps
to
greet
his
wife
who
stood
demurely
awaiting
his
caress
and
in
this
interval
mademoiselle
shot
at
nick
a
swift
and
withering
look
as
she
passed
him
he
returned
a
grimace
messieurs
said
monsieur
de
gré
turning
to
us
dinner
will
soon
be
ready
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
pardon
me
until
nick
followed
mademoiselle
with
his
eyes
until
she
had
disappeared
beyond
the
hall
she
did
not
so
much
as
turn
then
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
to
a
bench
under
a
magnolia
a
little
distance
away
where
he
seated
himself
and
looked
up
at
me
despairingly
behold
said
he
what
was
once
your
friend
and
cousin
your
counsellor
sage
and
guardian
behold
the
clay
which
conducted
you
hither
with
the
heart
neatly
but
painfully
extracted
look
upon
a
woman
s
work
davy
and
shun
the
sex
i
tell
you
it
is
better
to
go
blindfold
through
life
to
have
pardon
me
your
own
blunt
features
than
to
be
reduced
to
such
a
pitiable
state
was
ever
such
a
refinement
of
cruelty
practised
before
never
was
there
ever
such
beauty
such
archness
such
coquetry
such
damned
elusiveness
never
if
there
is
a
cargo
going
up
the
river
let
me
be
salted
and
lie
at
the
bottom
of
it
i
ll
warrant
you
i
ll
not
come
to
you
appear
to
have
suffered
somewhat
i
said
forgetting
for
the
moment
in
my
laughter
the
thing
that
weighed
upon
my
mind
suffered
he
cried
i
have
been
tossed
high
in
the
azure
that
i
might
sink
the
farther
into
the
depths
i
have
been
put
in
a
grave
the
earth
stamped
down
resurrected
and
flung
into
the
i
have
been
taken
up
to
the
gate
of
heaven
and
dropped
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
through
darkness
since
i
have
seen
you
i
have
been
the
round
of
all
the
bright
places
and
all
the
bottomless
pits
in
the
it
seems
to
have
made
you
literary
i
remarked
judicially
i
burn
up
twenty
times
a
day
he
continued
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
to
express
the
completeness
of
the
process
there
is
nothing
left
i
see
her
i
speak
to
her
and
i
burn
have
you
had
many
i
asked
not
one
he
retorted
fiercely
do
you
think
there
is
any
sense
in
the
damnable
french
custom
i
am
an
honorable
man
and
besides
i
am
not
equipped
for
an
elopement
no
priest
in
louisiana
would
marry
us
i
see
her
at
dinner
at
supper
sometimes
we
sew
on
the
gallery
he
went
on
but
i
give
you
my
oath
that
i
have
not
had
one
word
with
her
an
oath
is
not
necessary
i
said
but
you
seem
to
have
made
some
progress
do
you
call
that
progress
he
demanded
it
is
surely
not
god
knows
what
it
is
said
nick
helplessly
but
it
s
got
to
stop
i
have
sent
her
an
a
what
a
summons
her
father
and
mother
are
going
to
the
bertrands
and
i
have
written
her
a
note
to
meet
me
in
the
garden
and
you
he
cried
rising
and
slapping
me
between
the
shoulders
you
are
to
keep
watch
like
the
dear
careful
canny
sly
rascal
you
and
and
has
she
accepted
i
inquired
that
s
the
deuce
of
it
said
he
she
has
not
but
i
think
she
ll
i
stood
for
a
moment
regarding
him
and
you
really
love
mademoiselle
antoinette
i
asked
have
i
not
exhausted
the
language
he
answered
if
what
i
have
been
through
is
not
love
then
may
the
lord
shield
me
from
the
real
it
may
have
been
merely
a
light
case
of
tropical
enthusiasm
let
us
say
i
have
seen
others
a
little
milder
because
the
air
was
more
tropical
balderdash
he
exploded
if
you
are
not
the
most
exasperating
unfeeling
man
alive
i
merely
wanted
to
know
if
you
wished
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
gré
i
interrupted
he
gave
me
a
look
of
infinite
tolerance
have
i
not
made
it
plain
that
i
can
not
live
without
her
he
said
if
not
i
will
go
over
it
all
that
will
not
be
necessary
i
said
hastily
the
trouble
may
be
he
continued
that
they
have
already
made
one
of
their
matrimonial
contracts
with
a
granpré
a
beauséjour
a
monsieur
de
gré
is
a
very
sensible
man
i
answered
he
loves
his
daughter
and
i
doubt
if
he
would
force
her
to
marry
against
her
will
tell
me
nick
i
asked
laying
my
hand
upon
his
shoulder
do
you
love
this
girl
so
much
that
you
would
let
nothing
come
between
you
and
her
i
tell
you
i
do
and
again
i
tell
you
i
do
he
replied
he
paused
suddenly
glancing
at
my
face
and
added
why
do
you
ask
davy
i
stood
irresolute
now
that
the
time
had
come
not
daring
to
give
voice
to
my
suspicions
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
of
his
mother
save
that
once
and
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
whether
his
feeling
for
the
girl
might
not
soften
his
anger
against
her
i
have
never
lacked
the
courage
to
come
to
the
point
but
there
was
still
the
chance
that
i
might
be
mistaken
in
this
after
all
would
it
not
be
best
to
wait
until
i
had
ascertained
in
some
way
the
identity
of
clive
and
while
i
stood
debating
nick
regarding
me
with
a
puzzled
expression
monsieur
de
gré
appeared
on
the
gallery
come
gentlemen
he
cried
dinner
awaits
the
dining
room
at
les
îles
was
at
the
corner
of
the
house
and
its
windows
looked
out
on
the
gallery
which
was
shaded
at
that
place
by
dense
foliage
the
room
like
others
in
the
house
seemed
to
reflect
the
decorous
character
of
its
owner
two
grés
indifferently
painted
but
rigorous
and
respectable
relieved
the
whiteness
of
the
wall
they
were
the
and
his
wife
the
lattices
were
closed
on
one
side
and
in
the
deep
amber
light
the
family
silver
shone
but
dimly
the
dignity
of
our
host
the
evident
ceremony
of
the
meal
which
was
attended
by
three
servants
would
have
awed
into
a
modified
silence
at
least
a
less
irrepressible
person
than
nicholas
temple
but
nick
was
one
to
carry
by
storm
a
position
which
another
might
wait
to
reconnoitre
the
first
sensation
of
our
host
was
no
doubt
astonishment
but
he
was
soon
laughing
over
a
vivid
account
of
our
adventures
on
the
keel
boat
nick
s
imitation
of
xavier
and
his
description
of
benjy
s
terrors
after
the
storm
were
so
perfect
that
i
laughed
quite
as
heartily
and
madame
de
gré
wiped
her
eyes
and
repeated
continually
quel
drôle
monsieur
it
is
thus
he
has
entertained
us
since
thou
departed
as
for
mademoiselle
i
began
to
think
that
nick
was
not
far
wrong
in
his
diagnosis
training
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
she
would
not
laugh
not
she
but
once
or
twice
she
raised
her
napkin
to
her
face
and
coughed
slightly
for
the
rest
she
sat
demurely
with
her
eyes
on
her
plate
a
model
of
propriety
nick
s
sufferings
became
more
comprehensible
to
give
the
devil
his
due
nick
had
an
innate
tact
which
told
him
when
to
stop
and
perhaps
at
this
time
mademoiselle
s
superciliousness
made
him
subside
the
more
quickly
after
monsieur
de
gré
had
explained
to
me
the
horrors
of
the
indigo
pest
and
the
futility
of
sugar
raising
he
turned
to
his
daughter
toinette
where
is
madame
clive
he
asked
the
girl
looked
up
startled
into
life
and
interest
at
once
oh
papa
she
cried
in
french
we
are
so
worried
about
her
mamma
and
i
it
was
the
day
you
went
away
the
day
these
gentlemen
came
that
we
thought
she
would
take
an
airing
and
suddenly
she
became
monsieur
de
gré
turned
with
concern
to
his
wife
i
do
not
know
what
it
is
philippe
said
that
lady
it
seems
to
be
mental
the
loss
of
her
husband
weighs
upon
her
poor
lady
but
this
is
worse
than
ever
and
she
will
lie
for
hours
with
her
face
turned
to
the
wall
and
not
even
antoinette
can
arouse
i
have
always
been
able
to
comfort
her
before
said
antoinette
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
i
took
little
account
of
what
was
said
after
that
my
only
notion
being
to
think
the
problem
out
for
myself
and
alone
as
i
was
going
to
my
room
nick
stopped
me
come
into
the
garden
davy
he
said
when
i
have
had
my
siesta
i
answered
when
you
have
had
your
siesta
he
cried
since
when
did
you
begin
to
indulge
in
siestas
i
replied
and
left
him
staring
after
me
i
reached
my
room
bolted
the
door
and
lay
down
on
my
back
to
think
little
was
needed
to
convince
me
now
that
clive
was
temple
and
thus
the
lady
s
relapse
when
she
heard
that
her
son
was
in
the
house
was
accounted
for
instead
of
forming
a
plan
my
thoughts
drifted
from
that
into
pity
for
her
and
my
memory
ran
back
many
years
to
the
text
of
good
mason
s
sermon
i
have
refined
thee
but
not
with
silver
i
have
chosen
thee
in
the
furnace
of
what
must
sarah
temple
have
suffered
since
those
days
i
remembered
her
in
her
prime
in
her
beauty
in
her
selfishness
in
her
cruelty
to
those
whom
she
might
have
helped
and
i
wondered
the
more
at
the
change
which
must
have
come
over
the
woman
that
she
had
won
the
affections
of
this
family
that
she
had
gained
the
untiring
devotion
of
mademoiselle
antoinette
her
wit
might
not
account
for
it
for
that
had
been
cruel
and
something
of
the
agony
of
the
woman
s
soul
as
she
lay
in
torment
facing
the
wall
thinking
of
her
son
under
the
same
roof
of
a
life
misspent
and
irrevocable
i
pictured
a
stillness
crept
into
the
afternoon
like
the
stillness
of
night
the
wide
house
was
darkened
and
silent
and
without
a
sunlight
washed
with
gold
filtered
through
the
leaves
there
was
a
drowsy
hum
of
bees
and
in
the
distance
the
occasional
languishing
note
of
a
bird
singing
what
must
have
been
a
my
mind
wandered
and
shirked
the
task
that
was
set
to
it
could
anything
be
gained
by
meddling
i
had
begun
to
convince
myself
that
nothing
could
when
suddenly
i
came
face
to
face
with
the
consequences
of
a
possible
marriage
between
nick
and
mademoiselle
antoinette
in
that
event
the
disclosure
of
his
mother
s
identity
would
be
inevitable
not
only
his
happiness
was
involved
but
mademoiselle
s
her
father
s
and
her
mother
s
and
lastly
that
of
this
poor
hunted
woman
herself
who
thought
at
last
to
have
found
a
refuge
an
hour
passed
and
it
became
more
and
more
evident
to
me
that
i
must
see
and
talk
with
temple
but
how
was
i
to
communicate
with
her
at
last
i
took
out
my
portfolio
and
wrote
these
words
on
a
sheet
if
clive
will
consent
to
a
meeting
with
david
ritchie
he
will
deem
it
a
favor
ritchie
assures
clive
that
he
makes
this
request
in
all
i
lighted
a
candle
folded
the
note
and
sealed
it
addressed
it
to
clive
and
opening
the
latticed
door
i
stepped
out
walking
along
the
gallery
until
i
came
to
the
rear
part
of
the
house
which
faced
towards
the
i
spied
three
figures
prone
on
the
grass
under
a
pecan
tree
that
shaded
the
kitchen
roof
one
of
these
figures
was
benjy
and
he
was
taking
his
siesta
i
descended
quietly
from
the
gallery
and
making
my
way
to
him
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
awoke
and
stared
at
me
with
white
eyes
marse
dave
he
cried
hush
i
answered
and
follow
he
came
after
me
wondering
a
little
way
into
the
grove
where
i
stopped
benjy
i
said
do
you
know
any
of
the
servants
here
lawsy
marse
dave
i
reckon
i
knows
em
some
of

he
answered
with
a
grin

he
replied
with
a
fine
scorn
i
ain
t
no
hand

french
but
i
knows
some
on
em
and
right
well
how
i

down
sheepishly
at
his
feet
he
was
standing
i
done
c
ressed
some
on
em
marse
dave
he
said
at
length
and
there
was
a
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
you

what
i
asked
i
done
kissed
one
of
dem
yaller
gals

i
inquired
benjy
seemed
hurt
marse
dave
he
began
reproachfully
very
well
then
i
interrupted
taking
the
letter
from
my
pocket
there
is
a
lady
who
is
ill
here
clive
i
paused
for
a
new
look
had
come
into
benjy
s
eyes
he
began
that
peculiar
sympathetic
laugh
of
the
negro
which
catches
and
doubles
on
itself
and
i
imagined
that
a
new
admiration
for
me
dawned
on
his
face
yass
r
yass
marse
dave
i
reckon

within
an
hour
mélisse
shall
have
one
piastre
and
you
another
there
is
an
benjy
took
the
note
and
departed
nimbly
to
find
mélisse
while
i
paced
up
and
down
in
my
uneasiness
as
to
the
outcome
of
the
experiment
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
half
an
hour
and
then
i
saw
benjy
coming
through
the
trees
he
stood
before
me
chuckling
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
folded
piece
of
paper
i
gave
him
the
two
piastres
warned
him
if
his
master
or
any
one
inquired
for
me
that
i
was
taking
a
walk
and
bade
him
begone
then
i
opened
the
note
i
will
meet
you
at
the
bayou
at
seven
this
evening
take
the
path
that
leads
through
the
i
read
it
with
a
catch
of
the
breath
with
a
certainty
that
the
happiness
of
many
people
depended
upon
what
i
should
say
at
that
meeting
and
to
think
of
this
and
to
compose
myself
a
little
i
made
my
way
to
the
garden
in
search
of
the
path
that
i
might
know
it
when
the
time
came
entering
a
gap
in
the
hedge
i
caught
sight
of
the
shaded
seat
under
the
tree
which
had
been
the
scene
of
our
first
meeting
with
antoinette
and
i
hurried
past
it
as
i
crossed
the
garden
there
were
two
openings
in
the
opposite
hedge
the
one
through
which
nick
and
i
had
come
and
another
i
took
the
second
and
with
little
difficulty
found
the
path
of
which
the
note
had
spoken
it
led
through
a
dense
forest
in
the
direction
of
the
swamp
beyond
the
way
being
well
beaten
but
here
and
there
jealously
crowded
by
an
undergrowth
of
brambles
and
the
prickly
spanish
bayonet
i
know
not
how
far
i
had
walked
my
head
bent
in
thought
before
i
felt
the
ground
teetering
under
my
feet
and
there
was
the
bayou
it
was
a
narrow
lane
of
murky
impenetrable
water
shaded
now
by
the
forest
wall
imaged
on
its
amber
surface
were
the
twisted
boughs
of
the
cypresses
of
the
swamp
beyond
boughs
funereally
draped
as
though
to
proclaim
a
warning
of
unknown
perils
in
the
dark
places
on
that
side
where
i
stood
ancient
oaks
thrust
their
gnarled
roots
into
the
water
and
these
knees
were
bridged
by
treacherous
platforms
of
moss
as
i
sought
for
a
safe
a
dull
splash
startled
me
the
water
lilies
danced
on
the
ripples
and
a
long
black
snout
pushed
its
way
to
the
centre
of
the
bayou
and
floated
there
motionless
i
sat
down
on
a
wide
knee
that
seemed
to
be
fashioned
for
the
purpose
and
reflected
it
may
have
been
about
five
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
rather
than
return
and
risk
explanations
i
would
wait
where
i
was
until
temple
appeared
i
had
much
to
think
of
and
for
the
rest
the
weird
beauty
of
the
place
with
its
changing
colors
as
the
sun
fell
held
me
in
fascination
when
the
blue
vapor
stole
through
the
cypress
swamp
my
trained
ear
caught
the
faintest
of
warning
sounds
temple
was
coming
i
could
not
repress
the
exclamation
that
rose
to
my
lips
when
she
stood
before
me
i
have
changed
somewhat
she
began
quite
calmly
i
have
changed
since
you
were
at
temple
i
stood
staring
at
her
at
a
loss
to
know
whether
by
these
words
she
sought
to
gain
an
advantage
i
knew
not
whether
to
pity
or
to
be
angry
such
a
strange
blending
she
seemed
of
former
pride
and
arrogance
and
later
suffering
there
were
the
features
of
the
beauty
still
the
eyes
defiant
the
lips
scornful
sorrow
had
set
its
brand
upon
this
protesting
face
in
deep
violet
marks
under
the
eyes
in
lines
which
no
human
power
could
erase
sorrow
had
flecked
with
white
the
gold
of
the
hair
had
proclaimed
her
a
woman
with
a
history
for
she
had
a
new
and
remarkable
beauty
which
puzzled
and
astonished
me
a
beauty
in
which
maternity
had
no
place
the
figure
gowned
with
an
innate
taste
in
black
still
kept
the
rounded
lines
of
the
young
woman
while
about
the
shoulders
and
across
the
open
throat
a
lace
mantilla
was
thrown
she
stood
facing
me
undaunted
and
i
knew
that
she
had
come
to
fight
for
what
was
left
her
i
knew
further
that
she
was
no
mean
antagonist
will
you
kindly
tell
me
to
what
circumstance
i
owe
the
honor
of
this
summons
ritchie
she
asked
you
are
a
travelled
person
for
one
so
young
i
might
almost
say
she
added
with
an
indifferent
laugh
that
there
is
some
method
and
purpose
in
your
indeed
you
do
me
wrong
madame
i
replied
i
am
here
by
the
merest
again
she
laughed
lightly
and
stepping
past
me
took
her
seat
on
the
oak
from
which
i
had
risen
i
marvelled
that
this
woman
with
all
her
could
be
the
same
as
she
who
had
held
her
room
cowering
these
four
days
past
admiration
for
her
courage
mingled
with
my
other
feelings
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
knew
not
where
to
begin
my
experience
with
women
of
the
world
was
after
all
distinctly
limited
temple
knew
apparently
by
intuition
the
advantage
she
had
gained
and
she
smiled
the
ritchies
were
always
skilled
in
dealing
with
sinners
she
began
the
first
earl
had
the
habit
of
hunting
them
like
foxes
so
it
is
said
i
take
it
for
granted
that
before
my
sentence
is
pronounced
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
my
in
detail
i
could
not
ask
you
to
forego
that
you
seem
to
know
the
characteristics
of
my
family
temple
i
answered
there
is
one
trait
of
the
ritchies
concerning
which
i
ask
your
honest
and
what
is
that
she
said
carelessly
i
have
always
understood
that
they
have
spoken
the
truth
is
it
not
so
she
glanced
at
me
curiously
i
never
knew
your
father
to
lie
she
answered
but
after
all
he
had
few
chances
he
so
seldom
your
intercourse
with
me
at
temple
bow
was
quite
as
limited
i
said
ah
she
interrupted
quickly
you
bear
me
that
grudge
it
is
another
trait
of
the
i
bear
you
no
grudge
madame
i
replied
i
asked
you
a
question
concerning
the
veracity
of
my
family
and
i
beg
that
you
will
believe
what
i
and
what
is
this
momentous
statement
she
asked
i
had
hard
work
to
keep
my
temper
but
i
knew
that
i
must
not
lose
it
i
declare
to
you
on
my
honor
that
my
business
in
new
orleans
in
no
way
concerns
you
and
that
i
had
not
the
slightest
notion
of
finding
you
here
will
you
believe
that
and
what
then
she
asked
i
also
declare
to
you
that
since
meeting
your
son
my
chief
anxiety
has
been
lest
he
should
run
across
you
are
very
considerate
of
others
she
said
let
us
admit
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
you
come
here
by
it
was
the
opening
i
had
sought
for
but
despaired
of
getting
then
put
yourself
for
a
moment
in
my
place
madame
and
give
me
credit
for
a
little
kindliness
of
feeling
and
a
sincere
affection
for
your
there
was
a
new
expression
on
her
face
and
the
light
of
a
supreme
effort
in
her
eyes
i
give
you
credit
at
least
for
a
logical
mind
she
answered
in
spite
of
myself
you
have
put
me
at
the
bar
and
seem
to
be
conducting
my
i
do
not
see
why
there
should
be
any
rancor
between
us
i
answered
it
is
true
that
i
hated
you
at
temple
bow
when
my
father
was
killed
and
i
was
left
a
homeless
orphan
you
had
no
pity
for
me
though
your
husband
was
my
mother
s
brother
but
you
did
me
a
good
turn
after
all
for
you
drove
me
out
into
a
world
where
i
learned
to
rely
upon
myself
furthermore
it
was
not
in
your
nature
to
treat
me
not
in
my
nature
she
repeated
you
were
seeking
happiness
as
every
one
must
in
their
own
way
that
happiness
lay
apparently
with
ah
she
cried
with
a
catch
of
her
breath
i
thought
you
would
be
judging
i
am
stating
facts
your
son
was
a
sufficient
embarrassment
in
this
matter
and
i
should
have
been
an
additional
one
i
blame
you
not
temple
for
anything
you
have
done
to
me
but
i
blame
you
for
embittering
nick
s
and
he
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
detected
a
faltering
in
her
voice
i
will
hide
nothing
from
you
he
blames
you
with
what
justice
i
leave
you
to
she
did
not
answer
this
but
turned
her
head
away
towards
the
bayou
nor
could
i
determine
what
was
in
her
mind
and
now
i
ask
you
whether
i
have
acted
as
your
friend
in
begging
you
to
meet
she
turned
to
me
swiftly
at
that
i
am
at
a
loss
to
see
how
there
can
be
friendship
between
us
ritchie
she
said
very
good
then
madame
i
am
sorry
i
answered
i
have
done
all
that
is
in
my
power
and
now
events
will
have
to
take
their
i
had
not
gone
two
steps
into
the
wood
before
i
heard
her
voice
calling
my
name
she
had
risen
and
leaned
with
her
hand
against
the
oak
does
nick
know
that
you
are
here
she
cried
no
i
answered
shortly
then
i
realized
suddenly
what
i
had
failed
to
grasp
before
she
feared
that
i
would
pity
her
david
i
started
violently
at
the
sound
of
my
name
at
the
new
note
in
her
voice
at
the
change
in
the
woman
as
i
turned
and
then
before
i
realized
what
she
had
done
she
had
come
to
me
swiftly
and
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
david
does
he
hate
me
all
the
hope
remaining
in
her
life
was
in
that
question
was
in
her
face
as
she
searched
mine
with
a
terrible
scrutiny
and
never
had
i
known
such
an
ordeal
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
answer
and
as
i
stood
staring
back
at
her
a
smile
was
forced
to
her
lips
i
will
pay
you
one
tribute
my
friend
she
said
you
are
but
even
as
she
spoke
i
saw
her
sway
and
though
i
could
not
be
sure
it
were
not
a
dizziness
in
me
i
caught
her
i
shall
always
marvel
at
the
courage
there
was
in
her
for
she
straightened
and
drew
away
from
me
a
little
proudly
albeit
gently
and
sat
down
on
the
knee
of
the
oak
looking
across
the
bayou
towards
the
mist
of
the
swamp
there
was
the
infinite
calmness
of
resignation
in
her
next
speech
tell
me
about
him
she
said
she
was
changed
indeed
were
it
not
so
i
should
have
heard
of
her
own
sufferings
of
her
poor
hunted
life
from
place
to
place
of
countless
nights
made
sleepless
by
the
past
pride
indeed
was
left
but
the
fire
had
burned
away
the
last
vestige
of
selfishness
i
sat
down
beside
her
knowing
full
well
that
i
should
be
judged
by
what
i
said
she
listened
motionless
though
something
of
what
that
narrative
cost
her
i
knew
by
the
current
of
sympathy
that
ran
now
between
us
unmarked
the
day
faded
a
new
light
was
spread
over
the
waters
the
mist
was
spangled
with
silver
points
the
spanish
moss
took
on
the
whiteness
of
lace
against
the
black
forest
swamp
and
on
the
yellow
face
of
the
moon
the
leaves
of
a
gum
were
printed
at
length
i
paused
she
neither
spoke
nor
moved
save
for
the
rising
and
falling
of
her
shoulders
the
hardest
thing
i
had
to
say
i
saved
for
the
last
and
i
was
near
lacking
the
courage
to
continue
there
is
mademoiselle
antoinette
i
began
and
stopped
she
turned
on
me
so
quickly
and
laid
a
hand
on
mine
nick
loves
her
she
cried
you
know
it
i
exclaimed
wondering
ah
david
she
answered
brokenly
i
foresaw
it
from
the
first
i
too
love
the
girl
no
human
being
has
ever
given
me
such
care
and
such
affection
she
she
is
all
that
i
have
left
must
i
give
her
up
have
i
not
paid
the
price
of
my
sins
i
did
not
answer
knowing
that
she
saw
the
full
cruelty
of
the
predicament
what
happiness
remained
to
her
now
of
a
battered
life
stood
squarely
in
the
way
of
her
son
s
happiness
that
was
the
issue
and
no
advice
or
aid
of
mine
could
change
it
there
was
another
silence
that
seemed
to
me
an
eternity
as
i
watched
a
helpless
witness
the
struggle
going
on
within
her
at
last
she
got
to
her
feet
her
face
turned
to
the
shadow
i
will
go
david
she
said
her
voice
was
low
and
she
spoke
with
a
steadiness
that
alarmed
me
i
will
torn
with
pity
i
thought
again
but
i
could
see
no
alternative
and
then
suddenly
she
was
clinging
to
me
her
courage
gone
her
breast
shaken
with
sobs
where
shall
i
go
she
cried
god
help
me
are
there
no
remote
places
where
he
will
not
seek
me
out
i
have
tried
them
all
and
quite
as
suddenly
she
disengaged
herself
and
looked
at
me
strangely
you
are
well
revenged
for
temple
bow
she
said
hush
i
answered
and
held
her
fearing
i
knew
not
what
you
have
not
lacked
courage
it
is
not
so
bad
as
you
believe
i
will
devise
a
plan
and
help
you
have
you
money
yes
she
answered
with
a
remnant
of
her
former
pride
and
i
have
an
annuity
paid
now
to
then
listen
to
what
i
say
i
answered
i
will
take
you
to
new
orleans
and
hide
you
safely
and
i
swear
to
you
whether
it
be
right
or
wrong
that
i
will
use
every
endeavor
to
change
nick
s
feelings
towards
you
come
i
continued
leading
her
gently
into
the
path
let
us
go
while
there
is
yet
stop
she
said
and
i
halted
fearfully
david
ritchie
you
are
a
good
man
i
can
make
no
amends
to
you
she
did
not
finish
feeling
for
the
path
in
the
blackness
of
the
wood
i
led
her
by
the
hand
and
she
followed
me
as
trustfully
as
a
child
at
last
after
an
age
of
groping
the
heavy
scents
of
shrubs
and
flowers
stole
to
us
on
the
night
air
and
we
came
out
at
the
hedge
into
what
seemed
a
blaze
of
light
that
flooded
the
rows
of
color
here
we
paused
breathless
and
looked
the
bench
under
the
great
tree
was
vacant
and
the
garden
was
empty
it
was
she
who
led
the
way
through
the
hedge
who
halted
in
the
garden
path
at
the
sound
of
voices
she
turned
but
there
was
no
time
to
flee
for
the
tall
figure
of
a
man
came
through
the
opposite
hedge
followed
by
a
lady
one
was
nicholas
temple
the
other
mademoiselle
de
gré
temple
s
face
alone
was
in
the
shadow
and
as
i
felt
her
hand
trembling
on
my
arm
i
summoned
all
my
resources
it
was
nick
who
spoke
first
it
is
davy
he
cried
oh
the
sly
rascal
and
this
is
the
promenade
of
which
he
left
us
word
the
solitary
meditation
speak
up
man
you
are
forgiven
for
deserting
he
turned
laughing
to
mademoiselle
but
she
stood
with
her
lips
parted
and
her
hands
dropped
staring
at
my
companion
then
she
took
two
steps
forward
and
stopped
with
a
cry
mrs
clive
the
woman
beside
me
turned
and
with
a
supreme
courage
raised
her
head
and
faced
the
girl
yes
antoinette
it
is
i
she
answered
and
then
my
eyes
sought
nick
for
temple
had
faced
her
son
with
a
movement
that
was
a
challenge
yet
with
a
look
that
questioned
yearned
appealed
he
too
stared
the
laughter
fading
from
his
eyes
first
astonishment
and
then
anger
growing
in
them
slowly
surely
i
shall
never
forget
him
as
he
stood
there
for
what
seemed
an
age
recalling
one
by
one
the
wrongs
this
woman
had
done
him
she
herself
had
taught
him
to
brook
no
restraint
to
follow
impetuously
his
loves
and
hates
and
endurance
in
these
things
was
moulded
in
every
line
of
his
finely
cut
features
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
not
to
her
but
to
the
girl
at
his
side
do
you
know
who
this
is
he
said
tell
me
do
you
know
this
woman
mademoiselle
de
gré
did
not
answer
him
she
drew
near
gently
to
temple
whose
head
was
bowed
whose
agony
i
could
only
guess
mrs
clive
she
said
softly
though
her
voice
was
shaken
by
a
prescience
won
t
you
tell
me
what
has
happened
won
t
you
speak
to
me
antoinette
the
poor
lady
lifted
up
her
arms
as
though
to
embrace
the
girl
dropped
them
despairingly
and
turned
away
antoinette
she
murmured
antoinette
for
nick
had
seized
antoinette
by
the
hand
restraining
her
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
doing
he
cried
angrily
listen
i
had
stood
bereft
of
speech
watching
the
scene
breathlessly
and
now
i
would
have
spoken
had
not
mademoiselle
astonished
me
by
taking
the
lead
i
have
thought
since
that
i
might
have
pieced
together
this
much
of
her
character
her
glance
at
nick
surprised
him
momentarily
into
silence
i
know
that
she
is
my
dearest
friend
she
said
that
she
came
to
us
in
misfortune
and
that
we
love
her
and
trust
her
i
do
not
know
why
she
is
here
with
ritchie
but
i
am
sure
it
is
for
some
good
she
laid
a
hand
on
temple
s
shoulder
mrs
clive
won
t
you
speak
to
me
my
god
antoinette
listen
cried
nick
mrs
clive
is
not
her
name
i
know
her
david
knows
her
she
is
an
adventuress
temple
gave
a
cry
and
the
girl
shot
at
him
a
frightened
bewildered
glance
in
which
a
love
struggled
with
an
older
affection
an
adventuress
she
repeated
her
hand
dropping
oh
i
do
not
believe
it
i
can
not
believe
you
shall
believe
it
said
nick
fiercely
her
name
is
not
clive
ask
david
what
her
name
antoinette
s
lips
moved
but
she
shirked
the
question
and
nick
seized
me
roughly
tell
her
he
said
tell
her
my
god
how
can
i
do
it
tell
her
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
frame
the
speech
at
once
my
pity
and
a
and
surprising
respect
for
her
making
it
doubly
hard
to
pronounce
her
sentence
suddenly
she
raised
her
head
not
proudly
but
with
a
dignity
seemingly
conferred
by
years
of
sorrow
and
of
suffering
her
tones
were
even
bereft
of
every
vestige
of
hope
antoinette
i
have
deceived
you
though
as
god
is
my
witness
i
thought
no
harm
could
come
of
it
i
deluded
myself
into
believing
that
i
had
found
friends
and
a
refuge
at
last
i
am
mrs
temple
the
girl
repeated
the
name
sorrowfully
but
perplexedly
not
grasping
its
full
significance
she
is
my
mother
said
nick
with
a
bitterness
i
had
not
thought
in
him
she
is
my
mother
or
i
would
curse
her
for
she
has
ruined
my
life
and
brought
shame
on
a
good
he
paused
his
breath
catching
for
very
anger
temple
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
while
the
girl
shrank
back
in
terror
i
grasped
him
by
the
arm
have
you
no
compassion
i
cried
but
temple
interrupted
me
he
has
the
right
she
faltered
it
is
my
just
he
tore
himself
away
and
took
a
step
to
her
where
is
riddle
he
cried
as
god
lives
i
will
kill
him
without
mercy
his
mother
lifted
her
head
again
god
has
judged
him
she
said
quietly
he
is
beyond
your
vengeance
he
is
a
sob
shook
her
but
she
conquered
it
with
a
marvellous
courage
harry
riddle
loved
me
he
was
kind
to
me
and
he
was
a
better
man
than
john
nick
recoiled
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
seemed
to
go
leaving
a
more
dangerous
humor
then
i
have
been
blessed
with
parents
he
said
at
that
she
swayed
but
when
i
would
have
caught
her
she
motioned
me
away
and
turned
to
antoinette
twice
temple
tried
to
speak
i
i
was
going
away
she
said
at
length
and
you
would
never
have
seen
or
heard
of
me
more
my
nephew
david
ritchie
whom
i
treated
cruelly
as
a
boy
had
pity
on
me
he
is
a
good
man
and
he
was
to
have
taken
me
away
i
do
not
attempt
to
defend
myself
my
dear
but
i
pray
that
you
who
have
so
much
charity
will
some
day
think
a
little
kindly
of
one
who
has
sinned
deeply
of
one
who
will
love
and
bless
you
and
yours
to
her
dying
she
faltered
and
nick
would
have
spoken
had
not
antoinette
herself
stayed
him
with
a
gesture
i
wish
my
son
to
know
the
little
there
is
on
my
side
it
is
not
much
yet
god
may
not
spare
him
the
sorrow
that
brings
pity
i
i
loved
harry
riddle
as
a
girl
my
father
was
ruined
and
i
was
forced
into
marriage
with
john
temple
for
his
possessions
he
was
selfish
overbearing
cruel
unfaithful
during
the
years
i
lived
with
him
he
never
once
spoke
kindly
to
me
i
too
grew
wicked
and
selfish
and
heedless
my
head
was
turned
by
admiration
temple
escaped
to
england
in
a
he
left
me
without
a
line
of
warning
of
farewell
i
i
have
wandered
over
the
earth
haunted
by
remorse
and
i
knew
no
moment
of
peace
of
happiness
until
you
brought
me
here
and
sheltered
and
loved
me
and
even
here
i
have
had
many
sleepless
hours
a
hundred
times
i
have
summoned
my
courage
to
tell
you
i
could
not
i
am
justly
punished
she
moved
a
little
timidly
towards
the
girl
who
stood
motionless
dazed
by
what
she
heard
she
held
out
a
hand
appealingly
and
dropped
it
my
dear
god
will
bless
you
for
your
kindness
to
an
unfortunate
she
glanced
with
a
kind
of
terror
in
her
eyes
from
the
girl
to
nick
and
what
she
meant
to
say
concerning
their
love
i
know
not
for
the
flood
held
back
so
long
burst
upon
her
she
wept
as
i
have
never
seen
a
woman
weep
and
then
before
nick
or
i
knew
what
had
happened
antoinette
had
taken
her
swiftly
in
her
arms
and
was
murmuring
in
her
ear
you
shall
not
go
you
shall
not
you
will
live
with
me
presently
the
sobs
ceased
and
temple
raised
her
face
slowly
wonderingly
as
if
she
had
not
heard
aright
and
she
tried
gently
to
push
the
girl
away
no
antoinette
she
said
i
have
done
you
harm
but
the
girl
clung
to
her
strongly
passionately
i
do
not
care
what
you
have
done
she
cried
you
are
good
now
i
know
that
you
are
good
now
i
will
not
cast
you
out
i
will
i
stood
looking
at
them
bewildered
and
astonished
by
mademoiselle
s
loyalty
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
nick
as
had
i
and
then
as
i
turned
to
him
he
came
towards
them
almost
roughly
he
took
antoinette
by
the
arm
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
he
cried
come
away
antoinette
you
do
not
know
what
she
has
done
you
can
not
realize
what
she
antoinette
shrank
away
from
him
still
clinging
to
temple
there
was
a
fearless
directness
in
her
look
which
might
have
warned
him
she
is
your
mother
she
said
quietly
my
mother
he
repeated
yes
i
will
tell
you
what
a
mother
she
has
been
to
me
nick
it
passes
my
power
to
write
down
the
pity
of
that
appeal
the
hopelessness
of
it
the
yearning
in
it
freeing
herself
from
the
girl
temple
took
one
step
towards
him
her
arms
held
up
i
had
not
thought
that
his
hatred
of
her
was
deep
enough
to
resist
it
it
was
antoinette
whose
intuition
divined
this
ere
he
had
turned
away
you
have
chosen
between
me
and
her
he
said
and
before
we
could
get
the
poor
lady
to
the
seat
under
the
oak
he
had
left
the
garden
in
my
perturbation
i
glanced
at
antoinette
but
there
was
no
other
sign
in
her
face
save
of
tenderness
for
temple
temple
had
mercifully
fainted
as
i
crossed
the
lawn
i
saw
two
figures
in
the
deep
shadow
beside
the
gallery
and
i
heard
nick
s
voice
giving
orders
to
benjy
to
pack
and
saddle
when
i
reached
the
garden
again
the
girl
had
loosed
temple
s
gown
and
was
bending
over
her
murmuring
in
her
ear
many
hours
later
when
the
moon
was
waning
towards
the
horizon
fearful
of
surprise
by
the
coming
day
i
was
riding
slowly
under
the
trees
on
the
road
to
new
orleans
beside
me
veiled
in
black
her
head
bowed
was
temple
and
no
word
had
escaped
her
since
she
had
withdrawn
herself
gently
from
the
arms
of
antoinette
on
the
gallery
at
les
îles
nick
had
gone
long
before
the
hardest
task
had
been
to
convince
the
girl
that
temple
might
not
stay
after
that
antoinette
had
busied
herself
with
a
silent
fortitude
i
had
not
thought
was
in
her
making
ready
for
the
lady
s
departure
i
shall
never
forget
her
as
she
stood
a
slender
figure
of
sorrow
looking
down
at
us
the
tears
glistening
on
her
cheeks
and
i
could
not
resist
the
impulse
to
mount
the
steps
once
more
you
were
right
antoinette
i
whispered
whatever
happens
you
will
remember
that
i
am
your
friend
and
i
will
bring
him
back
to
you
if
i
she
pressed
my
hand
and
turned
and
went
slowly
into
the
house
book
iii
louisiana
chapter
i
the
rights
of
man
were
these
things
which
follow
to
my
thinking
not
extraordinary
i
should
not
write
them
down
here
nor
should
i
have
presumed
to
skip
nearly
five
years
of
time
for
indeed
almost
five
years
had
gone
by
since
the
warm
summer
night
when
i
rode
into
new
orleans
with
temple
and
in
all
that
time
i
had
not
so
much
as
laid
eyes
on
my
cousin
and
dearest
friend
her
son
i
searched
new
orleans
for
him
in
vain
and
learned
too
late
that
he
had
taken
passage
on
a
packet
which
had
dropped
down
the
river
the
next
morning
bound
for
charleston
and
new
york
i
have
an
instinct
that
this
is
not
the
place
to
relate
in
detail
what
occurred
to
me
before
leaving
new
orleans
suffice
it
to
say
that
i
made
my
way
back
through
the
swamps
the
forests
the
of
the
indian
country
along
the
natchez
trail
to
nashville
across
the
barrens
to
harrodstown
in
kentucky
where
i
spent
a
week
in
that
cabin
which
had
so
long
been
for
me
a
haven
of
refuge
dear
polly
ann
she
hugged
me
as
though
i
were
still
the
waif
whom
she
had
mothered
and
wept
over
the
little
presents
which
i
had
brought
the
children
harrodstown
was
changed
new
cabins
and
new
faces
met
me
at
every
turn
and
tom
more
disgruntled
than
ever
had
gone
with
boone
far
into
the
wilderness
i
went
back
to
louisville
to
take
up
once
more
the
struggle
for
practice
and
i
do
not
intend
to
charge
so
much
as
a
page
with
what
may
be
called
the
even
tenor
of
my
life
i
was
not
a
man
to
get
into
trouble
on
my
own
account
louisville
grew
amazingly
white
frame
houses
were
built
and
even
brick
ones
and
ere
kentucky
became
a
state
in
i
had
gone
as
delegate
to
more
than
one
of
the
danville
conventions
among
the
nations
as
you
know
a
storm
raged
and
the
great
swells
from
that
conflict
threatened
to
set
adrift
and
wreck
the
little
republic
but
newly
launched
the
noise
of
the
tramping
of
great
armies
across
the
old
world
shook
the
new
and
men
in
whom
the
love
of
fierce
fighting
was
born
were
stirred
to
quarrel
among
themselves
the
rights
of
man
how
many
wrongs
have
been
done
under
that
clause
the
bastille
stormed
the
swiss
guard
slaughtered
the
reign
of
terror
with
its
daily
procession
of
tumbrels
through
the
streets
of
paris
the
murder
of
that
amiable
and
gentleman
who
did
his
best
to
atone
for
the
sins
of
his
ancestors
the
fearful
months
of
waiting
suffered
by
his
queen
before
she
too
went
to
her
death
often
as
i
lighted
my
candle
of
an
evening
in
my
little
room
to
read
of
these
things
so
far
away
i
would
drop
my
kentucky
gazette
to
think
of
a
woman
whose
face
i
remembered
to
wonder
sadly
whether
hélène
de
gré
were
among
the
lists
in
her
i
was
sure
was
personified
that
courage
for
which
her
order
will
go
down
eternally
through
the
pages
of
history
and
in
my
darker
moments
i
pictured
her
standing
beside
the
guillotine
with
a
smile
that
haunted
me
the
hideous
image
of
that
strife
was
reflected
amongst
our
own
people
budget
after
budget
was
hurried
by
the
winds
across
the
sea
and
swift
couriers
carried
the
news
over
the
blue
wall
by
the
wilderness
trail
widened
now
and
thundered
through
the
little
villages
of
the
blue
grass
country
to
the
falls
what
interest
you
will
say
could
the
pioneer
lawyers
and
storekeepers
and
planters
have
in
the
french
revolution
the
rights
of
man
down
with
kings
general
washington
and
adams
and
hamilton
might
sigh
for
them
but
they
were
not
for
the
pioneers
of
the
west
citizen
was
the
proper
term
now
citizen
general
wilkinson
when
that
magnate
came
to
town
resplendent
in
his
brigadier
s
uniform
it
was
thought
that
wilkinson
would
plot
less
were
he
in
the
army
under
the
watchful
eye
of
his
superiors
little
they
knew
him
thus
the
republic
had
a
reward
for
adroitness
for
treachery
and
treason
but
what
reward
had
it
for
the
lonely
embittered
stricken
man
whose
genius
and
courage
had
gained
for
it
the
great
northwest
territory
what
reward
had
the
republic
for
him
who
sat
brooding
in
his
house
above
the
falls
for
citizen
general
clark
in
those
days
you
were
not
a
federalist
or
a
democrat
you
were
an
aristocrat
or
a
jacobin
the
french
parties
were
our
parties
the
french
issue
our
issue
under
the
patronage
of
that
saint
of
american
jacobinism
thomas
jefferson
a
jacobin
society
was
organized
in
philadelphia
special
guardians
of
liberty
and
flying
on
the
march
winds
over
the
mountains
the
seed
fell
on
the
black
soil
of
kentucky
lexington
had
its
jacobin
society
danville
and
louisville
likewise
their
patrons
and
protectors
of
the
rights
of
mankind
federalists
were
not
guillotined
in
kentucky
in
the
summer
of
but
i
might
mention
more
than
one
who
was
shot
in
spite
of
the
federalists
louisville
prospered
and
incidentally
i
prospered
in
a
mild
way
crede
behind
whose
store
i
still
lived
was
getting
rich
and
happened
to
have
an
affair
of
some
importance
in
philadelphia
wharton
was
kind
enough
to
recommend
a
young
lawyer
who
had
the
following
virtues
he
was
neither
handsome
nor
brilliant
and
he
wore
clothes
wharton
also
did
me
the
honor
to
say
that
i
was
cautious
and
painstaking
and
had
a
habit
of
tiring
out
my
adversary
therefore
in
the
early
summer
of
i
went
to
philadelphia
at
that
time
travellers
embarking
on
such
a
journey
were
prayed
over
as
though
they
were
going
to
tartary
i
was
absent
from
louisville
near
a
year
and
there
is
a
diary
of
what
i
saw
and
felt
and
heard
on
this
trip
for
the
omission
of
which
i
will
be
thanked
the
great
news
of
that
day
which
concerns
the
world
and
incidentally
this
story
was
that
citizen
genêt
had
landed
at
charleston
citizen
genêt
ambassador
of
the
great
republic
of
france
to
the
litle
republic
of
america
landed
at
charleston
acclaimed
by
thousands
and
lost
no
time
scarcely
had
he
left
that
city
ere
american
privateers
had
slipped
out
of
charleston
harbor
to
prey
upon
the
commerce
of
the
hated
mistress
of
the
sea
was
there
ever
such
a
march
of
triumph
as
that
of
the
citizen
ambassador
northward
to
the
capital
everywhere
toasted
and
feasted
monsieur
genêt
did
not
neglect
the
rights
of
man
for
without
doubt
the
united
states
was
to
declare
war
on
britain
within
a
fortnight
nay
the
citizen
ambassador
would
go
into
the
halls
of
congress
and
declare
war
himself
if
that
faltering
washington
refused
his
duty
citizen
genêt
organized
his
legions
as
he
went
along
and
threw
tricolored
cockades
from
the
windows
of
his
carriage
and
at
his
glorious
entry
into
philadelphia
where
i
afterwards
saw
the
great
man
with
my
own
eyes
washington
and
his
trembled
in
their
boots
it
was
late
in
april
when
i
reached
pittsburg
on
my
homeward
journey
and
took
passage
down
the
ohio
with
a
certain
captain
wendell
of
the
army
in
a
kentucky
boat
i
had
known
the
captain
in
louisville
for
he
had
been
stationed
at
fort
finney
the
army
post
across
the
ohio
from
that
town
and
he
had
come
to
pittsburg
with
a
sergeant
to
fetch
down
the
river
some
dozen
recruits
this
was
a
most
fortunate
circumstance
for
me
and
in
more
ways
than
one
although
the
captain
was
a
gruff
and
blunt
man
grizzled
and
a
he
could
be
a
delightful
companion
when
once
his
confidence
was
gained
and
as
we
drifted
in
the
mild
spring
weather
through
the
long
reaches
between
the
passes
he
talked
of
trenton
and
brandywine
and
yorktown
there
was
more
than
one
bond
of
sympathy
between
us
for
he
worshipped
washington
detested
the
french
party
and
had
a
hatred
for
filthy
democrats
second
to
none
i
have
ever
encountered
we
stopped
for
a
few
days
at
fort
harmar
where
the
muskingum
pays
its
tribute
to
the
ohio
built
by
the
federal
government
to
hold
the
territory
which
clark
had
won
and
leaving
that
hospitable
place
we
took
up
our
journey
once
more
in
the
very
of
the
spring
the
sunlight
was
like
the
tall
cottonwoods
growing
by
the
flaunted
a
proud
glory
of
green
the
hills
behind
them
that
formed
the
first
great
swells
of
the
sea
of
the
wilderness
were
clothed
in
a
thousand
sheens
and
shaded
by
the
purple
budding
of
the
oaks
and
walnuts
on
the
northern
slopes
on
the
yellow
sandbars
flocks
of
geese
sat
pluming
in
the
sun
or
rose
at
our
approach
to
cast
fleeting
shadows
on
the
water
their
echoing
from
the
hills
here
and
there
a
hawk
swooped
down
from
the
azure
to
break
the
surface
and
bear
off
a
wriggling
fish
that
gleamed
like
silver
and
at
eventide
we
would
see
at
the
brink
an
elk
or
doe
with
head
poised
watching
us
as
we
drifted
we
passed
here
and
there
a
lonely
cabin
to
set
my
thoughts
wandering
backwards
to
my
youth
and
here
and
there
in
the
dimples
of
the
hills
little
clusters
of
white
and
brown
houses
one
day
to
become
marts
of
the
republic
my
joy
at
coming
back
at
this
golden
season
to
a
country
i
loved
was
tempered
by
news
i
had
heard
from
captain
wendell
and
which
i
had
discussed
with
the
officers
at
fort
harmar
the
captain
himself
had
broached
the
subject
one
cool
evening
early
in
the
journey
as
we
sat
over
the
fire
in
our
little
cabin
he
had
been
telling
me
about
brandywine
but
suddenly
he
turned
to
me
with
a
kind
of
fierce
gesture
that
was
natural
to
the
man
ritchie
he
said
you
were
in
the
revolution
yourself
you
helped
clark
to
capture
that
country
and
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
northern
shore
why
the
devil
don
t
you
tell
me
about
it
you
never
asked
me
i
answered
he
looked
at
me
curiously
well
he
said
i
ask
you
i
began
lamely
enough
but
presently
my
remembrance
of
the
young
man
who
conquered
all
obstacles
who
compelled
all
men
he
met
to
follow
and
obey
him
carried
me
strongly
into
the
narrative
i
remembered
him
quiet
resourceful
a
natural
leader
at
a
bulwark
for
the
sorely
harried
settlers
of
kentucky
the
man
whose
clear
vision
alone
had
perceived
the
value
of
the
country
north
of
the
ohio
to
the
republic
who
had
compelled
the
governor
and
council
of
virginia
to
see
it
likewise
who
had
guarded
his
secret
from
all
men
who
in
the
face
of
fierce
opposition
and
intrigue
had
raised
a
little
army
to
follow
him
they
knew
not
where
who
had
surprised
kaskaskia
cowed
the
tribes
of
the
north
in
his
own
person
and
by
sheer
force
of
will
drew
after
him
and
kept
alive
a
motley
crowd
of
men
across
the
floods
and
through
the
ice
to
vincennes
we
sat
far
into
the
night
the
captain
listening
as
i
had
never
seen
a
man
listen
and
when
at
length
i
had
finished
he
was
for
a
long
time
silent
and
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
with
an
oath
that
woke
the
sleeping
soldiers
forward
and
glared
at
me
my
god
he
cried
it
is
enough
to
make
a
man
curse
his
uniform
to
think
that
such
a
man
as
wilkinson
wears
it
while
clark
is
left
to
rot
to
drink
himself
under
the
table
from
disappointment
to
plot
with
the
damned
jacobins
to
plot
i
cried
starting
violently
in
my
turn
the
captain
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
how
long
have
you
been
away
from
louisville
he
asked
it
will
be
a
year
i
answered
ah
said
the
captain
i
will
tell
you
it
is
more
than
a
year
since
clark
wrote
genêt
since
the
ambassador
bestowed
on
him
a
general
s
commission
in
the
army
of
the
french
a
general
s
commission
i
exclaimed
and
he
is
going
to
france
the
nation
which
had
driven
john
paul
jones
from
its
service
was
now
to
lose
george
rogers
clark
to
france
laughed
the
captain
no
this
is
become
france
enough
he
is
raising
in
kentucky
and
in
the
cumberland
country
an
army
with
a
cursed
name
some
of
his
old
illinois
scouts
mcchesney
whom
you
mentioned
for
one
have
been
collecting
bear
s
meat
and
venison
hams
all
winter
they
are
going
to
march
on
louisiana
and
conquer
it
for
the
french
republic
for
liberty
equality
the
rights
of
man
anything
you
on
louisiana
i
repeated
what
has
the
federal
government
been
doing
the
captain
winked
at
me
and
sat
down
the
federal
government
is
supine
a
so
our
friends
the
jacobins
say
who
have
been
shouting
at
easton
s
tavern
all
winter
nay
they
declare
that
all
this
country
west
of
the
mountains
too
will
be
broken
off
and
set
up
into
a
republic
and
allied
with
that
most
glorious
of
all
republics
france
believe
me
the
jacobins
have
not
been
idle
and
there
have
been
birds
of
french
plumage
dodging
between
the
general
s
house
at
clarksville
and
the
bear
i
was
silent
the
tears
almost
forcing
themselves
to
my
eyes
at
the
pathetic
sordidness
of
what
i
had
heard
it
can
come
to
nothing
continued
the
captain
in
a
changed
voice
general
clark
s
mind
is
unhinged
by
disappointment
mad
anthony
is
not
a
man
to
be
caught
sleeping
and
he
has
already
attended
to
a
little
expedition
from
the
cumberland
mad
anthony
loves
the
general
as
we
all
do
and
the
federal
government
is
wiser
than
the
jacobins
think
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
do
captain
wendell
paused
and
looked
at
me
fixedly
ritchie
general
clark
likes
you
and
you
have
never
offended
him
why
not
go
to
his
little
house
in
clarksville
when
you
get
to
louisville
and
talk
to
him
plainly
as
i
know
you
can
perhaps
you
might
have
some
general
wayne
of
revolutionary
fame
was
then
in
command
of
that
district
i
shook
my
head
sadly
i
intend
to
go
i
answered
but
i
will
have
no
chapter
ii
the
house
above
the
falls
it
was
and
shortly
after
dawn
we
slipped
into
the
quiet
water
which
is
banked
up
for
many
miles
above
the
falls
the
captain
and
i
sat
forward
on
the
deck
breathing
deeply
the
sharp
odor
which
comes
from
the
wet
forest
in
the
early
morning
listening
to
the
soft
splash
of
the
oars
and
watching
the
green
form
of
eighteen
mile
island
as
it
gently
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
ere
the
sun
had
risen
greatly
we
had
passed
twelve
mile
island
and
emerging
from
the
narrow
channel
which
divides
six
mile
island
from
the
northern
shore
we
beheld
on
its
terrace
above
the
bear
grass
louisville
shining
white
in
the
morning
sun
majestic
in
its
mile
of
width
calm
as
though
gathering
courage
the
river
seemed
to
straighten
for
the
ordeal
to
come
and
the
sound
of
its
waters
crying
over
the
rocks
far
below
came
faintly
to
my
ear
and
awoke
memories
of
a
day
gone
by
fearful
of
the
suck
we
crept
along
the
indian
shore
until
we
counted
the
boats
moored
in
the
bear
grass
and
presently
above
the
trees
on
our
right
we
saw
the
stars
and
stripes
floating
from
the
log
bastion
of
fort
finney
and
below
the
fort
on
the
gentle
sunny
slope
to
the
river
s
brink
was
spread
the
green
garden
of
the
garrison
with
its
sprouting
vegetables
and
fruit
trees
blooming
pink
and
white
we
were
greeted
by
a
company
of
buff
and
blue
officers
at
the
landing
and
i
was
bidden
to
breakfast
at
their
mess
captain
wendell
promising
to
take
me
over
to
louisville
afterwards
he
had
business
in
the
town
and
about
eight
of
the
clock
we
crossed
the
wide
river
in
one
of
the
barges
of
the
fort
and
made
fast
at
the
landing
in
the
bear
grass
but
no
sooner
had
we
entered
the
town
than
we
met
a
number
of
country
people
on
horseback
with
their
wives
and
daughters
ay
and
sweethearts
perched
up
behind
them
the
men
mostly
in
butternut
linsey
hunting
shirts
and
trousers
slouch
hats
and
red
handkerchiefs
stuck
into
their
bosoms
the
women
marvellously
pretty
and
fresh
in
stiff
cotton
gowns
and
quaker
hats
and
some
in
crimped
caps
with
ribbons
neatly
tied
under
the
chin
before
easton

tavern
joe
handy
the
fiddler
was
reeling
off
a
few
bars
of
hey

martin
to
the
familiar
crowd
of
loungers
under
the
big
poplar

in
the
middle
of
the
tune

wendell
howdy

drawled
another
a
huge
sallow
dirty
fellow
but
the
captain
only
glared
damn
him
he
said
after
i
had
spoken
to
joe
and
we
had
passed
on
he
ought
to
be
barbecued
he
nearly
bit
off
ensign
barry
s
nose
a
couple
of
months
ago
barry
tried
to
stop
the
beast
in
a
gouging
the
bright
morning
the
shady
streets
the
homelike
frame
and
log
houses
the
fragrant
odor
of
wafted
out
of
the
open
doorways
the
warm
greetings
all
made
me
happy
to
be
back
again
crede
rushed
out
and
escorted
us
into
his
cool
store
and
while
he
waited
on
his
country
customers
bade
his
negro
brew
a
bowl
of
toddy
at
the
mention
of
which
bill
whalen
chief
habitué
roused
himself
from
a
stupor
on
a
tobacco
barrel
presently
the
customers
having
indulged
in
the
toddy
departed
for
the
barbecue
the
captain
went
to
the
fort
and
crede
and
myself
were
left
alone
to
talk
over
the
business
which
had
sent
me
to
philadelphia
at
four
o
clock
having
finished
my
report
and
dined
with
my
client
i
set
out
for
clarksville
for
crede
had
told
me
among
other
things
that
the
general
was
there
louisville
was
deserted
the
tavern
porch
vacant
but
tacked
on
the
logs
beside
the
door
was
a
printed
bill
which
drew
my
curiosity
i
stopped
caught
by
a
familiar
name
in
large
type
at
the
head
of
it
george
clark
esquire
in
the
armies
of
france
and
of
the
french
revolutionary
legion
on
the
mississippi
river
proposals
for
raising
volunteers
for
the
reduction
of
the
spanish
posts
on
the
mississippi
for
opening
the
trade
of
the
said
river
and
giving
freedom
to
all
its
inhabitants
i
had
got
so
far
when
i
heard
a
noise
of
footsteps
within
and
easton
himself
came
out
in
his
by
cricky
davy
said
he
i
m
right
glad
ter
see
ye
ag
in
readin
the
general
s
bill
are
ye
tarnation
i
reckon
washington
and
all
his
european
fellers
east
of
the
mountains
won
t
be
able
ter
hold
us
back
this
time
i
reckon
we
ll
gallop
over
louisiany
in
the
face
of
all
the
spaniards
ever
created
i
ve
got
some
new
whiskey
i
low
will
sink
tallow
come
in
as
he
took
me
by
the
arm
a
laughter
and
shouting
came
from
the
back
room
it
s
some
of
them
frenchy
fellers
come
over
from
knob
licks
they
re
in
it
and
he
pointed
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
to
the
proclamation
and
thar
s
one
young
american
among
em
who
s
a
t
arer
come
i
drank
a
glass
of
easton
s
whiskey
and
asked
about
the
general
he
stays
over
thar
to
clarksville
pretty
much
said
easton
thar
ain
t
quite
so
much
walkin
araound
ter
do
he
added
significantly
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
where
jake
landrasse
sat
alone
on
the
gunwale
of
a
kentucky
boat
smoking
a
clay
pipe
as
he
fished
i
had
to
exercise
persuasion
to
induce
jake
to
paddle
me
across
which
he
finally
agreed
to
do
on
the
score
of
old
friendship
and
he
declared
that
the
only
reason
he
was
not
at
the
barbecue
was
because
he
was
waiting
to
take
a
few
gentlemen
to
see
general
clark
i
agreed
to
pay
the
damages
if
he
were
late
in
returning
for
these
gentlemen
and
soon
he
was
shooting
me
with
pulsing
strokes
across
the
expanse
towards
the
landing
at
fort
finney
louisville
and
the
fort
were
just
above
the
head
of
the
falls
and
the
little
town
of
clarksville
which
clark
had
founded
at
the
foot
of
them
i
landed
took
the
road
that
led
parallel
with
the
river
through
the
tender
green
of
the
woods
and
as
i
walked
the
mighty
song
which
the
falls
had
sung
for
ages
to
the
wilderness
rose
higher
and
higher
and
the
faint
spray
seemed
to
be
wafted
through
the
forest
and
to
hang
in
the
air
like
the
odor
of
a
summer
rain
it
was
the
sweet
caressing
note
of
the
thrush
mingled
with
the
music
of
the
water
the
dogwood
and
the
wild
plum
were
in
festal
array
but
my
heart
was
heavy
with
thinking
of
a
great
man
who
had
cheapened
himself
at
length
i
came
out
upon
a
clearing
where
fifteen
log
houses
marked
the
grant
of
the
federal
government
to
clark
s
regiment
perched
on
a
knoll
above
the
last
spasm
of
the
waters
in
their
race
for
peace
was
a
log
house
with
a
little
square
porch
in
front
of
the
door
as
i
rounded
the
corner
of
the
house
and
came
in
sight
of
the
porch
i
halted
by
no
will
of
my
own
at
the
sight
of
a
figure
sunken
in
a
wooden
chair
it
was
that
of
my
old
colonel
his
hands
were
folded
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
were
fixed
but
dimly
on
the
forests
of
the
kentucky
shore
across
the
water
his
hair
uncared
for
fell
on
the
shoulders
of
his
faded
blue
coat
and
the
stained
buff
waistcoat
was
unbuttoned
for
he
still
wore
unconsciously
the
colors
of
the
army
of
the
american
republic
general
i
said
he
started
got
to
his
feet
and
stared
at
me
oh
it
s
it
s
davy
he
said
i
i
was
expecting
some
friends
davy
what
what
s
the
matter
davy
i
have
been
away
i
am
glad
to
see
you
again
citizen
general
sir
in
the
army
of
the
french
republic
and
of
the
french
revolutionary
legion
on
the
you
will
always
be
colonel
clark
to
me
sir
i
answered
you
you
were
the
drummer
boy
i
remember
and
strutted
in
front
of
the
regiment
as
if
you
were
the
colonel
egad
i
remember
how
you
fooled
the
kaskaskians
when
you
told
them
we
were
going
he
looked
at
me
but
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
the
point
beyond
you
were
always
older
than
i
davy
are
you
married
in
spite
of
myself
i
laughed
as
i
answered
this
question
you
are
as
canny
as
ever
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
liberty
equality
fraternity
they
are
only
possible
for
the
hearing
a
noise
he
glanced
nervously
in
the
direction
of
the
woods
only
to
perceive
his
negro
carrying
a
pail
of
water
i
i
was
expecting
some
friends
he
said
sit
down
i
hope
i
am
not
intruding
general
i
said
not
daring
to
look
at
him
no
no
my
son
he
answered
you
are
always
welcome
did
we
not
campaign
together
did
we
not
shoot
these
very
falls
together
on
our
way
to
kaskaskia
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
above
the
roar
of
the
water
faith
well
i
remember
the
day
and
you
saved
it
davy
you
a
little
gamecock
a
little
eh
hamilton
s
scalp
hanging
by
a
lock
egad
and
they
frightened
out
of
their
five
wits
because
it
was
growing
he
laughed
and
suddenly
became
solemn
again
there
comes
a
time
in
every
man
s
life
when
it
grows
dark
davy
and
then
the
cowards
are
afraid
they
have
no
friends
whose
hands
they
can
reach
out
and
feel
but
you
are
my
friend
you
remember
that
you
said
you
would
always
be
my
friend
it
it
was
in
the
fort
at
i
remember
he
rose
from
the
steps
buttoned
his
waistcoat
and
straightened
himself
with
an
effort
he
looked
at
me
impressively
you
have
been
a
good
friend
indeed
davy
a
faithful
friend
he
said
you
came
to
me
when
i
was
sick
you
lent
me
money
he
waved
aside
my
protest
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
shall
soon
be
in
a
position
to
repay
you
to
reward
you
my
evil
days
are
over
and
i
spurn
that
government
which
spurned
me
for
the
honor
and
glory
of
which
i
founded
that
city
he
pointed
in
the
direction
of
louisville
for
the
power
and
wealth
of
which
i
conquered
this
northwest
territory
listen
i
am
now
in
the
service
of
a
republic
where
the
people
have
rights

am
of
the
french
revolutionary
legion
on
the
mississippi
despite
the
supineness
of
washington
the

and

a
maréchal
de
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
a
man
who
had
not
been
wont
to
speak
of
his
intentions
who
had
kept
his
counsel
for
a
year
before
kaskaskia
i
need
my
drummer
boy
davy
he
said
his
face
lighting
up
but
he
will
not
be
a
drummer
boy
now
he
will
be
a
trusted
officer
of
high
rank
mind
you
come
he
cried
seizing
me
by
the
arm
i
will
write
the
commission
this
instant
but
hold
you
read
french
i
remember
the
day
father
gibault
gave
you
your
first
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
drew
out
a
letter
and
handed
it
to
me
this
is
from
citizen
michaux
the
famous
naturalist
the
political
agent
of
the
french
republic
read
what
he
has
written
i
read
i
fear
in
a
faltering
voice
citoyen
général
un
homme
qui
a
donné
des
preuves
de
son
amour
pour
la
liberté
et
de
sa
haine
pour
le
despotisme
ne
devait
pas
s
adresser
en
vain
au
ministre
de
la
république
française
général
il
est
temps
que
les
américains
libres
de
l
ouest
soient
débarassés
d
un
ennemie
aussi
injuste
que
when
i
had
finished
i
glanced
at
the
general
but
he
seemed
not
to
be
heeding
me
the
sun
was
setting
above
the
ragged
line
of
forest
and
a
blue
veil
was
spreading
over
the
tumbling
waters
he
took
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
into
the
house
into
a
bare
room
that
was
all
awry
maps
hung
on
the
wall
beside
them
the
general
s
new
commission
rudely
framed
among
the
littered
papers
on
the
table
were
two
whiskey
bottles
and
several
glasses
and
strewn
about
were
a
number
of
chairs
the
arms
of
which
had
been
whittled
by
the
general
s
guests
across
the
rough
was
draped
the
french
tricolor
and
before
the
fireplace
on
the
puncheons
lay
a
huge
bearskin
which
undoubtedly
had
not
been
shaken
for
a
year
picking
up
a
bottle
the
general
poured
out
generous
helpings
in
two
of
the
glasses
and
handed
one
to
me
the
mists
are
bad
davy
said
he
i
i
can
not
afford
to
get
the
fever
now
let
us
drink
success
to
the
army
of
the
glorious
republic
let
us
drink
first
general
i
said
to
the
old
friendship
between
good
he
cried
tossing
off
his
liquor
he
set
down
the
glass
and
began
what
seemed
a
fruitless
search
among
the
thousand
papers
on
the
table
but
at
length
with
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
he
produced
a
form
and
held
it
under
my
eyes
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
was
that
and
calumniated
lady
the
goddess
of
liberty
now
he
said
drawing
up
a
chair
and
dipping
his
quill
into
an
almost
depleted
i
have
decided
to
make
you
david
ritchie
with
full
confidence
in
your
ability
and
loyalty
to
the
rights
of
liberty
and
mankind
a
captain
in
the
legion
on
the
i
crossed
the
room
swiftly
and
as
he
put
his
pen
to
paper
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
general
i
can
not
i
said
i
had
seen
from
the
first
the
futility
of
trying
to
dissuade
him
from
the
expedition
and
i
knew
now
that
it
would
never
come
off
i
was
willing
to
make
almost
any
sacrifice
rather
than
offend
him
but
this
i
could
not
allow
the
general
drew
himself
up
in
his
chair
and
stared
at
me
with
a
flash
of
his
old
look
you
can
not
he
repeated
you
have
affairs
to
attend
to
i
take
i
tried
to
speak
but
he
rode
me
down
there
is
money
to
be
made
in
that
prosperous
town
of
he
did
not
understand
the
pain
which
his
words
caused
me
he
rose
and
laid
his
hands
affectionately
on
my
shoulders
ah
davy
commerce
makes
a
man
timid
do
you
forget
the
old
days
when
i
was
the
father
and
you
the
son
come
i
will
make
you
a
fortune
undreamed
of
and
you
shall
be
my
fianancier
once
i
had
not
thought
of
the
money
general
i
answered
and
i
have
always
been
ready
to
leave
my
business
to
serve
a
there
there
said
the
general
soothingly
i
know
it
i
would
not
offend
you
you
shall
have
the
commission
and
you
may
come
when
it
pleases
he
sat
down
again
to
write
but
i
restrained
him
i
can
not
go
general
i
said
thunder
and
fury
cried
the
general
a
man
might
think
you
were
a
he
stared
at
me
and
stared
again
and
rose
and
recoiled
a
step
my
god
he
said
you
can
not
be
a
federalist
you
can
t
have
marched
to
kaskaskia
and
vincennes
you
can
t
have
been
a
friend
of
mine
and
have
seen
how
the
government
of
the
united
states
has
treated
me
and
be
a
federalist
it
was
an
argument
and
an
appeal
which
i
had
foreseen
yet
which
i
knew
not
how
to
answer
suddenly
there
came
unbidden
his
own
counsel
which
he
had
given
me
long
ago
serve
the
people
as
all
true
men
should
in
a
republic
but
do
not
rely
upon
their
this
man
had
bidden
me
remember
that
general
i
said
trying
to
speak
steadily
it
was
you
who
gave
me
my
first
love
for
the
republic
i
remember
you
as
you
stood
on
the
heights
above
kaskaskia
waiting
for
the
sun
to
go
down
and
you
reminded
me
that
it
was
the
nation
s
birthday
and
you
said
that
our
nation
was
to
be
a
refuge
of
the
oppressed
of
this
earth
a
nation
made
of
all
peoples
out
of
all
time
and
you
said
that
the
lands
beyond
and
i
pointed
to
the
west
as
he
had
done
should
belong
to
it
until
the
sun
sets
on
the
sea
i
glanced
at
him
for
he
was
silent
and
in
my
life
i
can
recall
no
sadder
moment
than
this
the
general
heard
but
the
man
who
had
spoken
these
words
was
gone
forever
the
eyes
of
this
man
before
me
were
fixed
as
it
were
upon
space
he
heard
but
he
did
not
respond
for
the
spirit
was
gone
what
i
looked
upon
was
the
tortured
body
from
which
the
genius
the
spirit
i
had
worshipped
had
fled
i
turned
away
only
to
turn
back
in
anger
what
do
you
know
of
this
france
for
which
you
are
to
fight
i
cried
have
you
heard
of
the
thousands
of
innocents
who
are
slaughtered
of
the
women
and
children
who
are
butchered
in
the
streets
in
the
name
of
liberty
what
have
those
adventurers
to
do
with
liberty
what
have
the
who
love
the
sight
of
blood
to
do
with
you
that
would
fight
for
them
you
warned
me
that
this
people
and
this
government
to
which
you
have
given
so
much
would
be
ungrateful
will
the
butchers
and
be
more
grateful
he
caught
only
the
word
grateful
and
he
rose
to
his
feet
with
something
of
the
old
straightness
and
of
the
old
power
and
by
evil
chance
his
eye
and
mine
fell
upon
a
sword
hanging
on
the
farther
wall
well
i
remembered
when
he
had
received
it
well
i
knew
the
inscription
on
its
blade
presented
by
the
state
of
virginia
to
her
beloved
son
george
rogers
clark
who
by
the
conquest
of
illinois
and
vincennes
extended
her
empire
and
aided
in
the
defence
of
her
by
evil
chance
i
say
his
eye
lighted
on
that
sword
in
three
steps
he
crossed
the
room
to
where
it
hung
snatched
it
from
its
scabbard
and
ere
i
could
prevent
him
he
had
snapped
it
across
his
knee
and
flung
the
pieces
in
a
corner
so
much
for
the
gratitude
of
my
country
he
said
i
had
gone
out
on
the
little
porch
and
stood
gazing
over
the
expanse
of
forest
and
waters
lighted
by
the
afterglow
then
i
felt
a
hand
upon
my
shoulder
i
heard
a
familiar
voice
calling
me
by
an
old
name
yes
general
i
turned
wonderingly
you
are
a
good
lad
davy
i
trust
you
he
said
i
i
was
expecting
some
he
lifted
a
hand
that
was
not
too
steady
to
his
brow
and
scanned
the
road
leading
to
the
fort
even
as
he
spoke
four
figures
emerged
from
the
woods
undoubtedly
the
gentlemen
who
had
held
the
council
at
the
inn
that
afternoon
we
watched
them
in
silence
as
they
drew
nearer
and
then
something
in
the
walk
and
appearance
of
the
foremost
began
to
bother
me
he
wore
a
long
redingote
that
fitted
his
slim
figure
to
perfection
and
his
gait
was
the
easy
gait
of
a
man
who
goes
through
the
world
careless
of
its
pitfalls
so
intently
did
i
stare
that
i
gave
no
thought
to
those
who
followed
him
suddenly
when
he
was
within
fifty
paces
a
cry
escaped
me
i
should
have
known
that
smiling
sallow
weakly
handsome
face
anywhere
in
the
world
the
gentleman
was
none
other
than
monsieur
auguste
de
gré
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
he
halted
and
swept
his
hand
to
his
hat
with
a
military
salute
citizen
general
he
said
gracefully
we
come
and
pay
our
respec
s
to
you
and
mek
our
report
and
ver
happy
to
see
you
look
well

vive
la

vive
le

cried
the
three
citizens
behind
him
citizens
you
are
very
welcome
answered
the
general
gravely
as
he
descended
the
steps
and
took
each
of
them
by
the
hand
citizens
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
my
old
friend
citizen
david
ritchie
milles

the

seizing
me
by
the
hand
c

cher
ami
monsieur
reetchie
ver
happy
you
have
this
honor
monsieur
and
snatching
his
military
cocked
hat
from
his
head
he
made
me
a
smiling
sweeping
bow
what
cried
the
general
to
me
you
know
the
sieur
de
gré
davy
he
is
my
guest
once
in
louisiane
mon
général

the
general
again

auguste
i
am
now
citizen
captain
de
gré
and
you
are
also
embark
in
the
glorious
cause
ah
i
am
happy
he
added
embracing
me
with
a
winning
glance
i
was
relieved
from
the
embarrassment
of
denying
the
impeachment
by
reason
of
being
introduced
to
the
other
notables
to
citizen
captain
sullivan
who
wore
an
undress
uniform
consisting
of
a
cotton
butternut
hunting
shirt
he
had
charge
on
the
bear
grass
of
building
the
boats
for
the
expedition
and
was
likewise
a
prominent
member
of
that
august
body
the
jacobin
society
of
lexington
next
came
citizen
quartermaster
depeau
now
of
knob
licks
kentucky
sometime
of
new
orleans
the
citizen
quartermaster
wore
his
hair
long
in
the
backwoods
fashion
he
had
a
keen
pale
face
and
sunken
eyes
ver
glad
mek
you
known
to
me
citizen
the
fourth
gentleman
was
likewise
french
and
called
gignoux
the
citizen
gignoux
made
some
sort
of
an
impression
on
me
which
i
did
not
stop
to
analyze
he
was
a
small
man
with
a
little
round
hand
that
wriggled
out
of
my
grasp
he
had
a
big
french
nose
bright
eyes
that
popped
a
little
and
gave
him
the
habit
of
looking
sidewise
and
grizzled
chestnut
eyebrows
over
them
he
had
a
mouth
and
a
round
chin
citizen
reetchie
is
it
i
laik
to
know
citizen
s
name
glorified
by
gran
cause
reetchie
will
you
enter
citizens
said
the
general
i
do
not
know
why
i
followed
them
unless
it
were
to
satisfy
a
curiosity
as
to
how
auguste
de
gré
had
got
there
we
went
into
the
room
where
the
general
s
slovenly
negro
was
already
lighting
the
candles
and
the
general
proceeded
to
collect
and
fill
six
of
the
glasses
on
the
table
it
was
citizen
captain
sullivan
who
gave
the
toast
citizens
he
cried
i
give
you
the
health
of
the
foremost
apostle
of
liberty
in
the
western
world
the
general
who
tamed
the
savage
tribes
who
braved
the
elements
who
brought
to
their
knees
the
minions
of
a
despot
a
slight
suspicion
of
a
hiccough
filled
this
gap
cast
aside
by
an
ungrateful
government
he
is
still
unfaltering
in
his
allegiance
to
the
people
may
he
lead
our
legion
victorious
through
the
spanish
vive
la
république
they
shouted
draining
their
glasses
vive
le
citoyen
général
clark
louisiana
shouted
citizen
sullivan
warming
louisiana
groaning
under
oppression
and
tyranny
is
imploring
us
with
uplifted
hands
to
those
remaining
veteran
patriots
whose
footsteps
we
followed
to
this
distant
desert
and
who
by
their
blood
and
toil
have
converted
it
into
a
smiling
country
we
now
look
under
your
guidance
citizen
general
we
fought
we
bled
how
far
the
citizen
captain
would
have
gone
is
problematical
i
had
noticed
a
look
of
disgust
slowly
creeping
into
the
citizen
quartermaster
s
eyes
and
at
this
juncture
he
seized
the
citizen
captain
and
thrust
him
into
a
chair
sacré
vent
he
exclaimed
it
is
the
proclamation
he
recites
the
proclamation
i
see
he
have
participate
in
those
handbill
poof
the
world
is
to
conquer
let
us
not
spik
so
i
give
you
one
toast
said
the
little
citizen
gignoux
slyly
we
all
bring
back
one
wife
from
nouvelle
orléans
ha
exclaimed
the
sieur
de
gré
laughing
the
citizen
captain
depeau
he
has
already
one
wife
in
nouvelle
it
is
unnecessary
for
the
editor
to
remind
the
reader
that
these
are
not
ritchie
s
words
but
those
of
an
adventurer
depeau
was
an
honest
and
worthy
gentleman
earnest
enough
in
a
cause
which
was
more
to
his
credit
than
to
an
american
s
according
to
contemporary
evidence
madame
depeau
was
in
new
orleans
the
citizen
quartermaster
was
angry
at
this
and
it
did
not
require
any
great
perspicacity
on
my
part
to
discover
that
he
did
not
love
the
citizen
de
gré
he
is
call
in
his
country
gumbo
de
gré
said
citizen
depeau
it
is
a
deesh
in
that
country
but
to
beesness
citizens
we
embark
on
glorious
enterprise
the
king
and
queen
of
france

for
her
treason

be
prepare
for
do
the
ha
exclaimed
the
sieur
de
gré
the
citizen
quartermaster
will
lose
his
provision
before
his
the
inference
was
plain
and
the
citizen
quartermaster
was
quick
to
take
it
up
we
are
all
among
frien
s
said
he
why

call

and
we
see
if
he
mek
you
a
murmur
of
surprise
escaped
from
several
of
the
company
and
they
all
stared
at
the
sieur
de
gré
but
general
clark
brought
down
his
fist
on
the
table
with
something
of
his
vigor
and
the
glasses
rattled
gentlemen
i
will
have
no
quarrelling
in
my
presence
he
cried
and
i
beg
to
inform
citizen
depeau
that
i
bestow
my
commissions
where
it
pleases
auguste
de
gré
rose
flushing
to
his
feet
citizens
he
said
with
a
fluency
that
was
easy
for
him
i
never
mek
secret
of
my
history
no
it
is
true
my
relation
monsieur
le
marquis
de
gré
bought
me
a
pair
of
colors
in
the
king
s
gardes
du
and
is
it
not

coackade

cried
depeau
monsieur
auguste
smiled
with
a
patient
tolerance

he

citizen
capitaine
he
spiks
all

turned
towards

sitting
back
in
his
chair
very
quiet
it
is
true
what
he
say
he
repeated
i
have
it
by
monsieur
genêt
gentlemen
said
general
clark
this
is
beside
the
question
and
i
will
not
have
these
petty
quarrels
i
may
as
well
say
to
you
now
that
i
have
chosen
the
citizen
captain
to
go
at
once
to
new
orleans
and
organize
a
regiment
among
the
citizens
there
faithful
to
france
on
account
of
his
family
and
supposed
royalist
tendencies
he
will
not
be
suspected
i
fear
that
a
month
at
least
has
yet
to
elapse
before
our
expedition
can
it
is
one
wise
choice
put
in
monsieur
gignoux

interrupted
general
clark
sitting
down
before
the
let
us
hear
the
quartermaster
s
report
of
the
supplies
at
knob
licks
and
citizen
sullivan
s
account
of
the
boats
but
hold
he
cried
glancing
around
him
where
is
captain

i
heard
that
he
had
come
to
louisville
from
the
cumberland
is
he
not
going
with
you
to
new
orleans
gré
i
took
up
the
name
involuntarily
captain
temple
i
repeated
while
they
stared
at
me
nicholas
temple
it
was
auguste
de
gré
who
replied
the
sem
he
said
i
recall
he
was
along
with
you
in
nouvelle
orléans
he
is
at
ze
tavern
and
he
has
had
one
gran
fight
and
he
is
ver
i
am
sorry
intoxicate
i
know
not
how
i
made
my
way
through
the
black
woods
to
fort
finney
where
i
discovered
jake
landrasse
and
his
canoe
the
road
was
long
and
yet
short
for
my
brain
whirled
with
the
expectation
of
seeing
nick
again
and
the
thought
of
this
poor
pathetic
ludicrous
expedition
compared
to
the
sublime
one
i
had
known
george
rogers
clark
had
come
to
this
chapter
iii
louisville
celebrates
they
have
gran
time
in
louisville
davy
said
jake
landrasse
as
he
paddled
me
towards
the
kentucky
shore
you
hear
i
should
be
stone
deaf
if
i
didn
t
i
answered
for
the
shouting
which
came
from
the
town
filled
me
with
forebodings
they
come
back
from
the
barbecue
full
of
whiskey
said
jake
and
a
young
man
at
the
tavern
come
out
on
the
porch
and
he
say
get
ready
you
all
to
go
to
louisiana
you

hole
back
long
enough
by
sam
barker

along
and
say
he

federalist
they

have
a
gran
fight
he
and
the
young
feller
and
sam
got
licked
he
went
at
sam
just
like
a
and
then
i
demanded
them
four
wanted
to
leave
said
jake
taking
no
trouble
to
disguise
his
disgust
and
i
had
to
fetch
em
over
i
ve
got
to
go
back
and
wait
for
em
now
and
he
swore
with
sincere
disappointment
i
reckon
there
ain
t
been
such
a
jamboree
in
town
for
jake
had
not
exaggerated
gentlemen
from
moore
s
settlement
from
sullivan
s
station
on
the
bear
grass
to
be
brief
the
entire
male
population
of
the
county
seemed
to
have
moved
upon
louisville
after
the
barbecue
and
i
paused
involuntarily
at
the
sight
which
met
my
eyes
as
i
came
into
the
street
a
score
of
sputtering
smoking
threw
a
lurid
light
on
as
many
hilarious
groups
and
revealed
fantastically
enough
the
boles
and
lower
branches
of
the
big
shade
trees
above
them
navigation
for
the
individual
difficult
enough
lower
down
in
front
of
the
tavern
became
positively
dangerous
there
was
a
human
eddy
nay
a
maelstrom
would
better
describe
it
fights
began
but
ended
abortively
by
reason
of
the
inability
of
the
combatants
to
keep
their
feet
one
man
whose
face
i
knew
passed
me
with
his
hat
afire
followed
by
several
companions
in
gusts
of
laughter
for
the
were
careless
and
burned
the
ears
of
their
friends
in
their
enthusiasm
another
person
whom
i
recognized
lacked
a
large
portion
of
the
front
of
his
attire
and
seemed
sublimely
unconscious
of
the
fact
his
face
was
badly
scratched
several
other
friends
of
mine
were
indulging
in
brief
intervals
of
rest
on
the
ground
and
i
barely
avoided
stepping
on
them
still
other
gentlemen
were
delivering
themselves
of
the
first
impressive
periods
of
orations
only
to
be
drowned
by
the
cheers
of
their
auditors
these
were
the
snatches
which
i
heard
as
i
picked
my
way
onward
with
exaggerated
fear
gentlemen
the
mississippi
is
ours
let
the
tyrants
who
forbid
its
use
beware
to
hell
with
the
federal
government
i
tell
you
sirs
this
land
is
ours
we
have
conquered
it
with
our
blood
and
i
reckon
no
spaniard
is
goin
to
stop
us
we
ain
t
come
this
far
to
stand
still
we
settled
kaintuck
fit
off
the
redskins
and
we
ll
march
across
the
mississippi
and
on
and
on
to
louisiany
they
shouted
and
the
whole
crowd
would
take
it
up
to
louisiany
open
the
river
so
absorbed
was
i
in
my
own
safety
and
progress
that
i
did
not
pause
to
think
as
i
have
often
thought
since
of
the
full
meaning
of
this
though
i
had
marked
it
for
many
years
the
support
given
to
wilkinson
s
plots
to
clark
s
expedition
was
merely
the
outward
and
visible
sign
of
the
onward
sweep
of
a
resistless
race
in
spite
of
untold
privations
and
hardships
of
cruel
warfare
and
massacre
these
people
had
toiled
over
the
mountains
into
this
land
and
impatient
of
check
or
hindrance
would
even
as
clark
had
predicted
when
their
numbers
were
sufficient
leap
the
mississippi
night
or
day
drunk
or
sober
they
spoke
of
this
thing
with
an
ever
increasing
vehemence
and
no
man
of
reflection
who
had
read
their
history
could
say
that
they
would
be
thwarted
one
day
louisiana
would
be
theirs
and
their
children
s
for
the
generations
to
come
one
day
louisiana
would
be
american
that
i
was
alive
and
unscratched
when
i
got
as
far
as
the
tavern
is
a
marvel
amongst
all
the
faces
which
surrounded
me
i
could
get
no
sight
of
nick
s
and
i
managed
to
make
my
way
to
a
momentarily
quiet
corner
of
the
porch
as
i
leaned
against
the
wall
there
trying
to
think
what
i
should
do
there
came
a
great
cheering
from
a
little
way
up
the
street
and
then
i
straightened
in
astonishment
above
the
cheering
came
the
sound
of
a
drum
beaten
in
marching
time
and
above
that
there
burst
upon
the
night
what
purported
to
be
the
marseillaise
taken
up
and
bawled
by
a
hundred
drunken
throats
and
without
words
those
around
me
who
were
sufficiently
nimble
began
to
run
towards
the
noise
and
i
ran
after
them
and
there
marching
down
the
middle
of
the
street
at
the
head
of
a
ragged
and
most
indecorous
column
of
twos
in
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
light
cast
by
a
which
joe
handy
held
was
nicholas
temple
his
bearing
if
a
trifle
unsteady
was
proud
and
if
i
could
believe
my
eyes
around
his
neck
was
slung
the
thing
which
i
prized
above
all
my
possessions
the
drum
which
i
had
carried
to
kaskaskia
and
vincennes
he
had
taken
it
from
the
peg
in
my
room
i
shrink
from
putting
on
paper
the
sentimental
side
of
my
nature
and
indeed
i
could
give
no
adequate
idea
of
my
affection
for
that
drum
and
then
there
was
nick
who
had
been
lost
to
me
for
five
years
my
impulse
was
to
charge
the
procession
seize
nick
and
the
drum
together
and
drag
them
back
to
my
room
but
the
futility
and
danger
of
such
a
course
were
apparent
and
the
caution
for
which
i
am
noted
prevented
my
undertaking
it
the
procession
augmented
by
all
those
to
whom
sufficient
power
of
motion
remained
cheered
by
the
helpless
but
willing
ones
on
the
ground
swept
on
down
the
street
and
through
the
town
even
at
this
late
day
i
shame
to
write
it
behold
me
david
ritchie
federalist
execrably
sober
at
the
head
of
the
column
behind
the
leader
was
it
twenty
minutes
or
an
hour
that
we
paraded
this
i
know
that
we
slighted
no
street
in
the
little
town
of
louisville
what
was
my
bearing
whether
proud
or
angry
or
carelessly
indifferent
i
know
not
the
glare
of
joe
handy
s
torch
fell
on
my
face
joe
handy
s
arm
and
that
of
another
gentleman
the
worse
for
liquor
were
linked
in
mine
and
they
saw
fit
to
applaud
at
every
step
my
conversion
to
the
cause
of
liberty
we
passed
time
and
time
again
the
respectable
of
my
federalist
friends
and
i
felt
their
eyes
upon
me
with
that
look
which
the
angels
have
for
the
fallen
once
in
front
of
wharton
s
house
mr
handy
burned
my
hair
apologized
staggered
and
i
took
the
torch
and
i
used
it
to
good
advantage
in
saving
the
drum
from
capture
for
temple
with
all
the
will
in
the
world
had
begun
to
stagger
at
length
after
marching
seemingly
half
the
night
they
halted
by
common
consent
before
the
house
of
a
prominent
democrat
who
shall
be
nameless
and
after
some
minutes
of
vain
importuning
nick
with
a
tattoo
on
the
drum
marched
boldly
up
to
the
gate
and
into
the
yard
a
desperate
cunning
came
to
my
aid
i
flung
away
the
torch
leaving
the
head
of
the
column
in
darkness
broke
from
handy
s
embrace
and
seizing
nick
by
the
arm
led
him
onward
through
the
premises
he
drumming
with
great
docility
followed
by
a
few
stragglers
only
some
of
whom
went
down
in
contact
with
the
trees
of
the
orchard
we
came
to
a
gate
at
the
back
which
i
knew
well
which
led
directly
into
the
little
yard
that
fronted
my
own
rooms
behind
crede
s
store
pulling
nick
through
the
gate
i
slammed
it
and
he
was
only
beginning
to
protest
when
i
had
him
safe
within
my
door
and
the
bolt
slipped
behind
him
as
i
struck
a
light
something
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
an
odor
of
alcohol
filled
the
air
and
as
the
candle
caught
the
flame
i
saw
a
shattered
whiskey
bottle
at
my
feet
and
a
room
which
had
been
given
over
to
carousing
in
spite
of
my
feelings
i
could
not
but
laugh
at
the
perfectly
irresistible
figure
my
cousin
made
as
he
stood
before
me
with
the
drum
slung
in
front
of
him
his
hat
was
gone
his
clothes
awry
but
he
smiled
at
me
benignly
and
without
a
trace
of
surprise
sho
you
ve
come
back
at
lasht
davy
he
said
you
re
you
re
very
irregular

n
andy
jackson
he
s
always
fightin
i
relieved
him
unprotesting
of
the
drum
thanking
my
stars
there
was
so
much
as
a
stick
left
of
it
he
watched
me
with
a
silent
and
exaggerated
interest
as
i
laid
it
on
the
table
from
a
distance
without
came
the
shouts
of
the
survivors
making
for
the
tavern
sfortunate

he
said
gravely
rwe

it

now
i
answered
looking
ruefully
at
the
battered
rim
where
nick
had
missed
the
skin
in
his
ardor
davy
said
he
funny
thing
i
didn
t
know

added
relevantly

on
my
shoulder
and
speaking
with
great
earnestness
i

let
go
my
shoulder
brushed
back
his
hair
in
a
fiery
manner
and
seizing
a
knife
which
unhappily
lay
on
the
table
gave
me
a
graphic
illustration
of
jackson
about
to
carve
the
pig
i
retreating
and
he
coming
on
n
when
he
stuck
the
pig
davy
he
poised
the
knife
for
an
instant
in
the
air
and
then
before
i
could
interpose
he
brought
it
down
deftly
through
the
head
of
my
precious
drum
and
such
a
frightful
agonized
squeal
filled
the
room
that
even
i
shivered
involuntarily
and
for
an
instant
i
had
a
vivid
vision
of
a
pig
struggling
in
the
hands
of
a
butcher
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
but
nick
regarded
me
soberly
funny
thing
davy
he
said
they
all
left
the
for
a
moment
he
appeared
to
be
ruminating
on
this
singular
phenomenon
then
he
continued
n
jackson
was
back
firsht
n
he
was
damned
impolite
n
he
shook
his
fist
in
my
face
here
nick
illustrated
jackson
s
gesture
n
he
said
great
god
sir
y
have
a
fine
talent
but
if
y
ever

that
again
i
ll
i
ll
kill
that

what
he
said
how
long
have
you
been
in
nashville
nick
i
asked
a
year
he
said
lookin
after
property
i
won
you
remember
and
why
didn
t
you
let
me
know
you
were
in
nashville
i
asked
though
i
realized
the
futility
of
the
question
thought
you
was
mad
at
me
he
answered
but
you
ain
t
davy
you
ve
been
very
t
let
me
have
your
he
straightened
i
am
ver
much
and
where
were
you
before
you
went
to
nashville
i
said
charleston
napolis
philadelphia
everywhere
he
answered
now
said
he
mgoin
t
i
applauded
this
determination
but
doubted
whether
he
meant
to
carry
it
out
however
i
conducted
him
to
the
back
room
where
he
sat
himself
down
on
the
edge
of
my
and
after
conversing
a
little
longer
on
the
subject
of
jackson
who
seemed
to
have
gotten
upon
his
brain
he
toppled
over
and
instantly
fell
asleep
with
his
clothes
on
for
a
while
i
stood
over
him
the
old
affection
welling
up
so
strongly
within
me
that
my
eyes
were
dimmed
as
i
looked
upon
his
face
spare
and
handsome
it
was
and
boyish
still
the
weaker
lines
emphasized
in
its
relaxation
would
that
relentless
spirit
with
which
he
had
been
born
make
him
too
a
wanderer
forever
and
was
it
not
the
strangest
of
fates
which
had
impelled
him
to
join
this
madcap
expedition
of
this
other
man
i
loved
george
rogers
clark
i
went
out
closed
the
door
and
lighting
another
candle
took
from
my
portfolio
a
packet
of
letters
two
of
them
i
had
not
read
having
found
them
only
on
my
return
from
philadelphia
that
morning
they
were
all
signed
simply
sarah
temple
they
were
dated
at
a
certain
number
in
the
rue
bourbon
new
orleans
and
each
was
a
tragedy
in
that
which
it
had
left
unsaid
there
was
no
suspicion
of
heroics
there
was
no
railing
at
fate
the
letters
breathed
but
the
one
hope
that
her
son
might
come
again
to
that
happiness
of
which
she
had
robbed
him
there
were
in
all
but
twelve
and
they
were
brief
for
some
affliction
had
nearly
deprived
the
lady
of
the
use
of
her
right
hand
i
read
them
twice
over
and
then
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
i
sat
staring
at
the
candles
reflecting
upon
my
own
helplessness
i
was
startled
from
this
revery
by
a
knock
rising
hastily
i
closed
the
door
of
my
bedroom
thinking
i
had
to
do
with
some
drunken
reveller
who
might
be
noisy
the
knock
was
repeated
i
slipped
back
the
bolt
and
peered
out
into
the
night
i
saw
dat
light
said
a
voice
which
i
recognized
i
think
i
come
in
to
say
good
i
opened
the
door
and
he
walked
in
you
are
one
night
owl
monsieur
reetchie
he
said
and
you
seem
to
prefer
the
small
hours
for
your
visits
monsieur
de
gré
i
could
not
refrain
from
replying
he
swept
the
room
with
a
glance
and
i
thought
a
shade
of
disappointment
passed
over
his
face
i
wondered
whether
he
were
looking
for
nick
he
sat
himself
down
in
my
chair
stretched
out
his
legs
and
regarded
me
with
something
less
than
his
usual
complacency
i
have
much
laik
for
you
monsieur
reetchie
he
began
and
waved
aside
my
bow
of
acknowledgment
before
i
go
away

he
paused
and
while
i
wondered
what
revelations
he
was
about
to
make
i
could
not
repress
my
impatience
at
the
preamble

i

on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to

but
the
uselessness
of

was
apparent
you

monsieur
i
am
justify
before
you
before
my
frien
s
that

all

and
he
gave
another
shrug
in
defiance
of
the
world
at
large
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
for
principle
if
i
remain
royalist

monsieur
you

miniature

four
hundred
livres
i
remember
i
said
it

because
i
have
much
confidence
in

monsieur
he
said
it
is
because
i
go

that
i
come

and
ask
you
to
do
me
a
you
honor
me
too
much
monsieur
i
answered
though
i
could
scarce
refrain
from
smiling
it
is
because
of
your
charactair
monsieur
auguste
was
good
enough
to
say
you
are
to
be
repose
in
you
are
to
be
rely
on
sometime
i
think
you
ver
ole
man
and
this
is
why
and
sence
you
laik
objects
of
art
that
i
bring
this
and
ask
you
keep
it
while
i
am
in
i
was
mystified
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
coat
and
drew
forth
an
oval
object
wrapped
in
dirty
paper
and
then
disclosed
to
my
astonished
eyes
the
miniature
of
mademoiselle
de
gré
the
miniature
i
say
for
the
gold
back
and
setting
were
lacking
auguste
had
retained
only
the
ivory
whether
from
sentiment
or
necessity
i
will
not
venture
the
sight
of
it
gave
me
a
strange
sensation
and
i
can
scarcely
write
of
the
anger
and
disgust
which
surged
over
me
of
the
longing
to
snatch
it
from
his
trembling
fingers
suddenly
i
forgot
auguste
in
the
lady
herself
there
was
something
emblematical
in
the
misfortune
which
had
bereft
the
picture
of
its
setting
even
so
the
revolution
had
taken
from
her
a
brilliant
life
a
king
and
queen
home
and
friends
yet
the
spirit
remained
unquenchable
set
above
its
mean
surroundings
ay
and
untouched
by
them
i
was
filled
with
a
painful
curiosity
to
know
what
had
become
of
her
which
i
repressed
auguste
s
voice
aroused
me
ah
monsieur
is
it
not
a
face
to
love
to
adore
it
is
a
face
to
obey
i
answered
with
some
heat
and
with
more
truth
than
i
knew
mon
dieu
monsieur
it
is
so
it
is
that
mek
me
love
you
know
not
how
you
know
not
what
love
is
monsieur
reetchie
you
never
love
laik
me
you
have
not
sem
risson
monsieur
he
continued
leaning
forward
and
putting
his
hand
on
my
knee
i
think
she
love
me
i
am
not
sure
i
should
not
be
surprise
but
monsieur
le
marquis

trit

said
after
a
pause

sighed
and
held
out
the
miniature
to
me

be
as

and
keep
it
for

cried
and
added
as
though
with
an
afterthought
monsieur
would
you
be
so
kin
as
to
borrow
me
fif
dollars
chapter
iv
of
a
sudden
resolution
it
was
nearly
morning
when
i
fell
asleep
in
my
chair
from
sheer
exhaustion
for
the
day
before
had
been
a
hard
one
even
for
me
i
awoke
with
a
start
and
sat
for
some
minutes
trying
to
collect
my
scattered
senses
the
sun
streamed
in
at
my
open
door
the
birds
hopped
on
the
lawn
and
the
various
sounds
of
the
bustling
life
of
the
little
town
came
to
me
from
beyond
suddenly
with
a
glimmering
of
the
mad
events
of
the
night
i
stood
up
walked
uncertainly
into
the
back
room
and
stared
at
the
bed
it
was
empty
i
went
back
into
the
outer
room
my
eye
wandered
from
the
shattered
whiskey
bottle
which
was
still
on
the
floor
to
the
table
littered
with
temple
s
letters
and
there
in
the
midst
of
them
lay
a
note
addressed
with
my
name
in
a
big
unformed
hand
i
opened
it
mechanically
dear
davy
so
it
ran
i
have
gone
away
i
can
not
tell
you
where
some
day
i
will
come
back
and
you
will
forgive
me
god
bless
you
he
had
gone
away
to
new
orleans
i
had
long
ceased
trying
to
account
for
nick
s
actions
but
the
more
i
reflected
the
more
incredible
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
should
have
gone
there
of
all
places
and
yet
i
had
had
it
from
clark
s
own
lips
indiscreet
enough
now
that
nick
and
gré
were
to
prepare
the
way
for
an
insurrection
there
my
thoughts
ran
on
to
other
possibilities
would
he
see
his
mother
but
he
had
no
reason
to
know
that
temple
was
still
in
new
orleans
then
my
glance
fell
on
her
letters
lying
open
on
the
table
had
he
read
them
i
put
this
down
as
improbable
for
he
was
a
man
who
held
strictly
to
a
point
of
honor
and
then
there
was
antoinette
de
gré
i
ceased
to
conjecture
here
dashed
some
water
in
my
eyes
pulled
myself
together
and
seizing
my
hat
hurried
out
into
the
street
i
made
a
sufficiently
indecorous
figure
as
i
ran
towards
the
barely
nodding
to
my
acquaintances
on
the
way
it
was
a
fresh
morning
a
river
breeze
stirred
the
waters
of
the
bear
grass
and
as
i
stood
scanning
the
line
of
boats
there
i
heard
footsteps
behind
me
i
turned
to
confront
a
little
man
with
grizzled
chestnut
eyebrows
he
was
none
other
than
the
citizen
gignoux
you
tek
ze
air
monsieur
reetchie
said
he
you
look
for
some
one
yes
you
git
up
too
late
see
him
i
made
a
swift
resolve
never
to
quibble
with
this
man
so
temple
has
gone
to
new
orleans
with
the
sieur
de
gré
i
said
citizen
gignoux
laid
a
fat
finger
on
one
side
of
his
great
nose
the
nose
was
red
and
shiny
i
remember
and
glistened
in
the
sunlight
ah
said
he
tis
no
use
tryin
hide
from
you
however
monsieur
reetchie
you
are
the
ver
soul
of
honor
and
then
your
frien
i
know
you
not
betray
the
sieur
de
gré
he
is
ver
fon
of
betray
i
exclaimed
there
is
no
question
of
betrayal
as
far
as
i
can
see
your
plans
are
carried
on
openly
with
a
fine
contempt
for
the
federal
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
tis
not
my
doin
he
said
but
i
am
what
you
call
it
a
cipher
sicrecy
is
what
i
believe
but
drink
too
much
talk
too
much
is
it
not
so
monsieur
and
if
monsieur
le
baron
de
carondelet
ze
governor
hear
they
are
in
new
orleans
i
think
they
go
to
havana
or
he
smiled
but
perhaps
the
expression
of
my
face
caused
him
to
sober
abruptly
it
is
necessair
for
the
cause
we
must
have
good
revolution
in
a
suspicion
of
this
man
came
over
me
for
a
childlike
simplicity
characterized
the
other
ringleaders
in
this
expedition
clark
had
had
acumen
once
and
lost
it
gré
was
a
fool
nick
temple
was
leading
purposely
a
reckless
life
the
citizens
sullivan
and
depeau
had
to
say
the
least
a
limited
knowledge
of
affairs
all
of
these
were
responding
more
or
less
sincerely
to
the
cry
of
the
people
of
kentucky
every
day
more
passionate
that
something
be
done
about
louisiana
but
gignoux
seemed
of
a
different
feather
moreover
he
had
been
too
shrewd
to
deny
what
colonel
clark
would
have
denied
in
a
soberer
moment
that
gré
and
nick
had
gone
to
new
orleans
you
not
spik
monsieur
you
not
think
they
have
success
you
are
not
federalist
no
for
i
hear
you
march
las
night
with
your
frien
i
hear
you
wave
you
make
it
your
business
to
hear
a
great
deal
monsieur
gignoux
i
retorted
my
temper
slipping
a
little
he
hastened
to
apologize
mille
pardons
monsieur
he
said
i
see
you
are
federalist
but
drunk
is
it
not
so
monsieur
you
tink
this
ver
silly
thing
this
whatever
i
think
monsieur
i
answered
i
am
a
friend
of
general
clark
an
enemy
of
ze
cause
he
put
in
monsieur
i
said
if
president
washington
and
general
wayne
do
not
think
it
worth
while
to
interfere
with
your
plans
neither
do
i
left
him
abruptly
and
went
back
to
my
affairs
with
a
heavy
heart
the
more
i
thought
the
more
criminally
foolish
nick
s
journey
seemed
to
me
however
puerile
the
undertaking
de
lemos
at
natchez
and
carondelet
at
new
orleans
had
not
the
reputation
of
sleeping
at
their
posts
and
their
hatred
for
americans
was
well
known
i
sought
general
clark
but
he
had
gone
to
knob
licks
and
in
my
anxiety
i
lay
awake
at
night
tossing
in
my
bed
one
evening
perhaps
four
days
after
nick
s
departure
i
went
into
the
common
room
of
the
tavern
and
there
i
was
surprised
to
see
an
old
friend
his
square
saffron
face
was
just
the
same
his
little
jet
eyes
snapped
as
brightly
as
ever
his
hair
which
was
swept
high
above
his
forehead
and
tied
in
an
eelskin
behind
was
as
black
as
when
i
had
seen
it
at
kaskaskia
i
had
met
monsieur
vigo
many
times
since
for
he
was
a
familiar
figure
amongst
the
towns
of
the
ohio
and
the
mississippi
and
from
vincennes
to
anse
à
la
graisse
and
even
to
new
orleans
his
reputation
as
a
financier
was
greater
than
ever
he
was
talking
to
my
friend
marshall
but
he
rose
when
he
saw
me
with
a
beaming
smile
ha
it
is
davy
he
cried
but
not
the
sem
lil
drummer
boy
who
would
not
come
into
my
store
reech
lawyer
now
i
hear
you
make
much
money
now
congress
money
i
said
monsieur
vigo
threw
out
his
hands
and
laughed
exactly
as
he
had
done
in
his
log
store
at
kaskaskia
congress
have
never
repay
me
one
sou
said
monsieur
vigo
making
a
face
i
have
try
i
have
talk
i
have
represent
it
is
no
good
davy
it
is
your
fault
you
tell
me
tek
dat
money
you
call
dat
finance
david
said
marshall
sharply
what
the
devil
is
this
i
hear
of
your
carrying
a
torch
in
a
jacobin
procession
you
may
put
it
down
to
liquor
marshall
i
answered
then
you
must
have
had
a
cask
egad
said
marshall
for
i
never
saw
you
i
laughed
i
shall
not
attempt
to
explain
it
sir
i
answered
you
must
not
allow
your
drum
to
drag
you
into
bad
company
again
said
he
and
resumed
his
conversation
as
i
suspected
it
was
a
vigorous
condemnation
of
general
clark
and
his
new
expedition
i
expressed
my
belief
that
the
government
did
not
regard
it
seriously
and
would
forbid
the
enterprise
at
the
proper
time
you
are
right
sir
said
marshall
bringing
down
his
fist
on
the
table
i
have
private
advices
from
philadelphia
that
the
president
s
consideration
for
governor
shelby
is
worn
out
and
that
he
will
issue
a
proclamation
within
the
next
few
days
warning
all
citizens
at
their
peril
from
any
connection
with
the
i
laughed
as
a
matter
of
fact
marshall
said
i
citizen
genêt
has
been
liberal
with
nothing
except
commissions
and
they
have
neither
money
nor
the
rascals
have
all
left
town
said
marshall
citizen
quartermaster
depeau
their
local
financier
has
gone
back
to
his
store
at
knob
licks
the
sieur
de
gré
and
a
temple
as
doubtless
you
know
have
gone
to
new
orleans
and
the
most
mysterious
and
therefore
the
most
dangerous
of
the
lot
citizen
gignoux
has
vanished
like
an
evil
spirit
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
he
too
has
gone
down
the
river
you
may
see
him
vigo
said
marshall
turning
to
the
trader
he
is
a
little
man
with
a
big
nose
and
grizzled
chestnut
ah
i
know
a
lil
bout
him
said
monsieur
vigo
he
was
on
my
boat
two
days
ago
asking
me
the
devil
he
was
said
marshall
i
had
another
disquieting
night
and
by
the
morning
i
had
made
up
my
mind
the
sun
was
glinting
on
the
placid
waters
of
the
river
when
i
made
my
way
down
to
the
bank
to
a
great
keel
boat
that
lay
on
the
bear
grass
with
its
square
sail
furled
an
awning
was
stretched
over
the
deck
and
at
a
walnut
table
covered
with
papers
sat
monsieur
vigo
smoking
his
morning
pipe
davy
said
he
you
have
come
à
la
bonne
heure
at
ten
i
depart
for
new
he
sighed
it
is
so
long
voyage
he
added
and
so
lonely
one
sometime
i
have
the
good
fortune
to
pick
up
a
companion
but
not
do
you
want
me
to
go
with
you
i
said
he
looked
at
me
incredulously
i
should
be
delighted
he
said
but
you
mek
a
i
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
i
answered
for
i
have
business
in
new
orleans
i
shall
be
ha
cried
monsieur
vigo
hospitably
i
shall
be
enchant
we
will
talk
philosophe
beaumarchais
voltaire
for
monsieur
vigo
was
a
great
reader
and
we
had
often
indulged
in
conversation
which
we
flattered
ourselves
had
a
literary
turn
i
spent
the
remaining
hours
arranging
with
a
young
lawyer
of
my
acquaintance
to
look
after
my
business
and
at
ten
o
clock
i
was
aboard
the
keel
boat
with
my
small
baggage
at
eleven
monsieur
vigo
and
i
were
talking
philosophe
over
a
wonderful
breakfast
under
the
awning
as
we
dropped
down
between
the
shores
of
the
ohio
my
host
travelled
in
luxury
and
we
ate
the
creole
dishes
which
his
cook
prepared
with
silver
forks
which
he
kept
in
a
great
chest
in
the
cabin
you
who
read
this
may
feel
something
of
my
impatience
to
get
to
new
orleans
and
hence
i
shall
not
give
a
long
account
of
the
journey
what
a
contrast
it
was
to
that
which
nick
and
i
had
taken
five
years
before
in
monsieur
gratiot
s
fur
boat
like
all
successful
creole
traders
monsieur
vigo
had
a
wonderful
knack
of
getting
on
with
the
indians
and
often
when
we
tied
up
of
a
night
the
chief
men
of
a
tribe
would
come
down
to
greet
him
we
slipped
southward
on
the
great
yellow
river
which
parted
the
wilderness
with
its
sucks
and
eddies
and
green
islands
every
one
of
which
monsieur
knew
and
i
saw
again
the
flocks
of
and
herons
in
procession
and
hawks
and
vultures
wheeling
in
their
search
sometimes
a
favorable
wind
sprang
up
and
we
hoisted
the
sail
we
passed
the
walnut
hills
the
nogales
the
moans
of
the
alligators
broke
our
sleep
by
night
and
at
length
we
came
to
natchez
ruled
over
now
by
that
of
the
spanish
king
gayoso
de
lemos
thanks
to
monsieur
vigo
his
manners
were
charming
and
his
hospitality
gracious
and
there
was
no
trouble
whatever
about
my
passport
our
progress
was
slow
when
we
came
at
last
to
the
belvedered
plantation
houses
amongst
the
orange
groves
and
as
we
sat
on
the
wide
galleries
in
the
summer
nights
we
heard
all
the
latest
gossip
of
the
capital
of
louisiana
the
river
was
low
there
was
an
ominous
quality
in
the
heat
which
had
its
effect
indeed
upon
me
and
made
the
old
creoles
shake
their
heads
and
mutter
a
word
with
a
terrible
meaning
new
orleans
was
a
cesspool
said
the
enlightened
the
baron
de
carondelet
indefatigable
man
aimed
at
digging
a
canal
to
relieve
the
city
of
its
filth
but
this
would
be
the
year
when
it
was
most
needed
and
it
was
not
dug
yes
monsieur
le
baron
was
energy
itself
that
other
fever
the
political
one
he
had
scotched
ça
ira
and
la
marseillaise
had
been
sung
in
the
theatres
but
not
often
for
the
baron
had
sent
the
alcaldes
to
shut
them
up
certain
gentlemen
of
french
ancestry
had
gone
to
languish
in
the
morro
at
havana
yes
monsieur
de
carondelet
though
fat
was
on
horseback
before
dawn
new
orleans
was
fortified
as
it
never
had
been
before
the
militia
organized
real
cannon
were
on
the
ramparts
which
could
shoot
at
a
pinch
sub
rosa
i
found
much
sympathy
among
the
planters
with
the
rights
of
man
what
had
become
they
asked
of
the
expedition
of
citizen
general
clark
preparing
in
the
north
they
may
have
sighed
secretly
when
i
painted
it
in
its
true
colors
but
they
loved
peace
these
planters
strangely
enough
the
name
of
auguste
de
gré
never
crossed
their
lips
and
i
got
no
trace
of
him
or
nick
at
any
of
these
places
was
it
possible
that
they
might
not
have
come
to
new
orleans
after
all
through
the
days
when
the
sun
beat
upon
the
awning
with
a
tropical
fierceness
when
monsieur
vigo
abandoned
himself
to
his
siestas
i
thought
it
was
perhaps
characteristic
of
me
that
i
waited
nearly
three
weeks
to
confide
in
my
old
friend
the
purpose
of
my
journey
to
new
orleans
it
was
not
because
i
could
not
trust
him
that
i
held
my
tongue
but
because
i
sought
some
way
of
separating
the
more
intimate
story
of
nick
s
mother
and
his
affair
with
antoinette
de
gré
from
the
rest
of
the
story
but
monsieur
vigo
was
a
man
of
importance
in
louisiana
and
i
reflected
that
a
time
might
come
when
i
should
need
his
help
one
evening
when
we
were
tied
up
under
the
oaks
of
a
bayou
i
told
him
there
emanated
from
monsieur
vigo
a
sympathy
which
few
men
possess
and
this
i
felt
strongly
as
he
listened
breaking
his
silence
only
at
long
intervals
to
ask
a
question
it
was
a
still
night
i
remember
of
great
beauty
with
a
wisp
of
a
moon
hanging
over
the
forest
line
the
air
heavy
with
odors
and
vibrant
with
a
thousand
insect
tones
and
what
you
do
davy
he
said
at
length
i
must
find
my
cousin
and
gré
before
they
have
a
chance
to
get
into
much
mischief
i
answered
if
they
have
already
made
a
noise
i
thought
of
going
to
the
baron
de
carondelet
and
telling
him
what
i
know
of
the
expedition
he
will
understand
what
gré
is
and
i
will
explain
that
temple
s
reckless
love
of
adventure
is
at
the
bottom
of
his
share
in
the
bon
davy
said
my
host
if
you
go
i
go
with
you
but
i
believe
ze
baron
think
morro
good
place
for
them
jus
the
sem
ze
baron
has
been
make
misérable
with
jacobins
but
i
go
with
you
if
you
he
discoursed
for
some
time
upon
the
quality
of
the
gré
s
their
public
services
and
before
he
went
to
sleep
he
made
the
very
just
remark
that
there
was
a
flaw
in
every
string
of
beads
as
for
me
i
went
down
into
the
cabin
surreptitiously
lighted
a
candle
and
drew
from
my
pocket
that
piece
of
ivory
which
had
so
strangely
come
into
my
possession
once
more
the
face
upon
it
had
haunted
me
since
i
had
first
beheld
it
the
miniature
was
wrapped
now
in
a
silk
handkerchief
which
polly
ann
had
bought
for
me
in
lexington
shall
i
confess
it
i
had
carefully
rubbed
off
the
discolorations
on
the
ivory
at
the
back
and
the
picture
lacked
now
only
the
gold
setting
as
for
the
face
i
had
a
kind
of
consolation
from
it
i
seemed
to
draw
of
its
strength
when
i
was
tired
of
its
courage
when
i
faltered
and
during
those
four
days
of
indecision
in
louisville
it
seemed
to
say
to
me
in
words
that
i
could
not
evade
or
forget
go
to
new
it
was
a
sentiment
foolish
if
you
please
which
could
not
resist
nay
which
i
did
not
try
to
resist
for
i
had
little
enough
of
it
in
my
life
what
did
it
matter
i
should
never
see
madame
la
vicomtesse
d
she
was
hélène
to
me
and
the
artist
had
caught
the
strength
of
her
soul
in
her
face
in
the
eyes
that
flashed
with
wit
and
courage
eyes
that
seemed
to
look
with
scorn
upon
what
was
mean
in
the
world
and
untrue
with
pity
on
the
weak
here
was
one
who
might
have
governed
a
province
and
still
have
been
a
woman
one
who
had
taken
into
exile
the
best
of
safeguards
against
misfortune
humor
and
an
indomitable
spirit
chapter
the
house
of
the
honeycombed
tiles
as
long
as
i
live
i
shall
never
forget
that
sunday
morning
of
my
second
arrival
at
new
orleans
a
saffron
hung
over
the
river
and
the
city
robbed
alike
from
the
yellow
waters
of
the
one
and
the
pestilent
moisture
of
the
other
it
would
have
been
strange
indeed
if
this
capital
of
louisiana
brought
hither
to
a
swamp
from
the
sands
of
biloxi
many
years
ago
by
the
energetic
bienville
were
not
visited
from
time
to
time
by
the
scourge
again
i
saw
the
green
villas
on
the
outskirts
the
expanse
of
roofs
of
the
city
behind
the
levee
bank
the
line
of
kentucky
boats
keel
boats
and
barges
which
brought
our
own
resistless
commerce
hither
in
the
teeth
of
royal
mandates
farther
out
and
tugging
fretfully
in
the
yellow
current
were
the
aliens
of
the
blue
seas
their
tracery
of
masts
and
spars
shimmering
in
the
heat
a
ocean
packet
from
spain
a
barque
and
brigantine
from
the
west
indies
a
rakish
slaver
from
africa
with
her
dry
discharged
but
yesterday
of
a
teeming
horror
of
freight
i
looked
again
upon
the
familiar
rows
of
trees
which
shaded
the
gravelled
promenades
where
nick
had
first
seen
antoinette
then
we
were
under
it
for
the
river
was
low
and
the
officer
was
bowing
over
our
passports
beneath
the
awning
we
walked
ashore
monsieur
vigo
and
i
and
we
joined
a
staring
group
of
keel
boatmen
and
under
the
willows
below
us
the
white
shell
walks
of
the
place
d
armes
were
thronged
with
gayly
dressed
people
over
their
heads
rose
the
fine
new
cathedral
built
by
the
munificence
of
don
andreas
almonaster
and
beside
that
the
cabildo
nearly
finished
which
will
stand
for
all
time
a
monument
to
spanish
builders
it
is
corpus
christi
day
said
monsieur
vigo
let
us
go
and
see
the
here
once
more
were
the
negresses
the
gay
creole
gowns
and
scarfs
the
merchants
with
those
of
soberer
and
more
conventional
dress
laughing
and
chatting
the
children
playing
despite
the
heat
many
of
these
people
greeted
monsieur
vigo
there
were
the
saturnine
spaniards
too
and
a
greater
number
than
i
had
believed
of
my
own
countrymen
lounging
about
mildly
amused
by
the
scene
we
crossed
the
square
and
with
the
courtesy
of
their
race
the
people
made
way
for
us
in
the
press
and
we
were
no
sooner
placed
ere
the
procession
came
out
of
the
church
flaming
soldiers
of
the
governor
s
guard
two
by
two
sober
sandalled
friars
in
brown
priests
in
their
robes
another
batch
of
color
crosses
shimmering
tapers
emerging
from
the
cool
darkness
within
to
pale
by
the
light
of
day
then
down
on
their
knees
to
him
who
sits
high
above
the
yellow
haze
fell
the
thousands
in
the
place
d
armes
for
here
was
the
host
itself
in
white
and
crimson
its
canopy
upheld
by
four
tonsured
priests
a
sheen
of
purple
under
it
the
bishop
of
louisiana
in
his
robes
the
governor
whispered
monsieur
vigo
and
the
word
was
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
as
the
people
rose
from
their
knees
françois
louis
hector
baron
de
carondelet
resplendent
in
his
uniform
of
colonel
in
the
royal
army
of
spain
his
orders
glittering
on
his
breast
pillar
of
royalty
and
enemy
to
the
rights
of
man
his
eye
was
stern
his
carriage
erect
but
i
seemed
to
read
in
his
careworn
face
the
trials
of
three
years
in
this
moist
capital
after
the
governor
one
by
one
the
waiting
associations
fell
in
line
each
with
its
own
distinguishing
sash
so
the
procession
moved
off
into
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
the
people
in
the
place
dispersed
to
new
vantage
points
and
monsieur
vigo
signed
me
to
follow
him
i
have
a
frien
la
veuve
gravois
who
lives
ver
quiet
she
have
one
room
and
i
ask
her
tek
you
in
he
led
the
way
through
the
empty
rue
chartres
turned
to
the
right
at
the
rue
bienville
and
stopped
before
an
unpretentious
house
some
three
doors
from
the
corner
madame
gravois
elderly
wizened
primp
in
a
starched
cotton
gown
opened
the
door
herself
fell
upon
monsieur
vigo
in
the
creole
fashion
and
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
installed
in
her
best
room
which
gave
out
on
a
little
court
behind
monsieur
vigo
promised
to
send
his
servant
with
my
baggage
told
me
his
address
bade
me
call
on
him
for
what
i
wanted
and
took
his
leave
first
there
was
madame
gravois
story
to
listen
to
as
she
bustled
about
giving
orders
to
a
negro
girl
concerning
my
dinner
then
came
the
dinner
excellent
if
i
could
have
eaten
it
the
virtues
of
the
former
monsieur
gravois
were
legion
he
had
come
to
louisiana
from
toulon
planted
indigo
fought
a
duel
and
madame
was
a
widow
so
i
condense
two
hours
into
two
lines
happily
madame
was
not
proof
against
the
habits
of
the
climate
and
she
retired
for
her
siesta
i
sought
my
room
almost
suffocated
by
a
heat
which
defies
my
pen
to
describe
a
heat
reeking
with
moisture
sucked
from
the
foul
kennels
of
the
city
i
had
felt
nothing
like
it
in
my
former
visit
to
new
orleans
it
seemed
to
bear
down
upon
my
brain
to
clog
the
power
of
thought
to
make
me
vacillating
hitherto
my
reasoning
had
led
me
to
seek
monsieur
de
gré
to
count
upon
that
gentleman
s
common
sense
and
his
former
friendship
but
now
that
the
time
had
come
for
it
i
shrank
from
such
a
meeting
i
remembered
his
passionate
affection
for
antoinette
i
imagined
that
he
would
not
listen
calmly
to
one
who
was
in
some
sort
connected
with
her
unhappiness
so
a
kind
of
cowardice
drove
me
first
to
temple
she
might
know
much
that
would
save
me
useless
trouble
and
blundering
the
shadows
of
thatch
and
wall
were
lengthening
as
i
walked
along
the
rue
bourbon
heedless
of
what
the
morrow
might
bring
forth
the
street
was
given
over
to
festivity
merry
groups
were
gathered
on
the
corners
songs
and
laughter
mingled
in
the
billiard
balls
clicked
in
the
cabarets
a
fat
jolly
little
frenchman
surrounded
by
tripping
children
sat
in
his
doorway
on
the
edge
of
the
banquette
fiddling
with
all
his
might
pausing
only
to
wipe
the
beads
of
perspiration
from
his
face
madame
clive
mais
oui
monsieur
l
petite
maison
en
smiling
benignly
at
the
children
he
began
to
fiddle
once
more
the
little
house
opposite
temple
mistress
of
temple
bow
had
come
to
this
it
was
a
strange
little
home
indeed
spanish
its
dormers
hidden
by
a
honeycombed
screen
of
tiles
this
screen
was
set
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
roof
which
overhung
the
banquette
and
shaded
the
yellow
adobe
wall
of
the
house
low
unpretentious
the
latticed
shutters
of
its
two
windows
giving
it
but
a
scant
air
of
privacy
indeed
they
were
scarred
by
the
raps
of
careless
on
the
sidewalk
the
two
little
battened
doors
one
step
up
were
closed
i
rapped
waited
and
rapped
again
the
musician
across
the
street
stopped
his
fiddling
glanced
at
me
smiled
knowingly
at
the
children
and
they
paused
in
their
dance
to
stare
then
one
of
the
doors
was
pushed
open
a
scant
four
inches
a
scarlet
madras
handkerchief
appeared
in
the
crack
above
a
yellow
face
there
was
a
long
moment
of
silence
during
which
i
felt
the
scrutiny
of
a
pair
of
sharp
black
eyes
what
yo
want
marse
the
woman
s
voice
astonished
me
for
she
spoke
the
dialect
of
the
american
i
should
like
to
see
clive
i
answered
the
door
closed
a
shade
mistis
sick
she
ain
t

said
the
woman
she
closed
the
door
a
little
more
and
i
felt
tempted
to
put
my
foot
in
the
crack
tell
her
that
david
ritchie
is
here
i
said
there
was
an
instant
s
silence
then
an
exclamation
lan
sakes
is

marse
dave
she
opened
the
door
furtively
i
thought
just
wide
enough
for
me
to
pass
through
i
found
myself
in
a
darkened
room
opposite
a
trim
negress
who
stood
with
her
arms
akimbo
and
stared
at
me

come
hither
to
share
her
mistress

the
door
into

and
temple
stood
on
the
threshold
staring
with
uncertain
eyes
into
the
lindy
she
said
what
have
you
done
miss
sally
lindy
began
and
looked
at
me
but
i
could
not
speak
for
looking
at
the
lady
in
the
doorway
who
is
it
she
said
again
and
her
hand
sought
the
tremblingly
who
is
it
then
i
went
to
her
at
my
first
step
she
gave
a
little
cry
and
swayed
and
had
i
not
taken
her
in
my
arms
i
believe
she
would
have
fallen
david
she
said
david
is
it
you
i
i
can
not
see
very
well
why
did
you
not
speak
she
looked
at
lindy
and
smiled
it
is
because
i
am
an
old
woman
lindy
and
she
lifted
her
hand
to
her
forehead
see
my
hair
is
white
i
shock
you
leaning
on
my
shoulder
she
led
me
through
a
little
bedroom
in
the
rear
into
a
tiny
garden
court
beyond
a
court
teeming
with
lavish
colors
and
redolent
with
the
scent
of
flowers
a
white
shell
walk
divided
the
garden
and
ended
at
the
door
of
a
low
outbuilding
from
the
chimney
of
which
blue
smoke
curled
upward
in
the
evening
air
temple
drew
me
almost
fiercely
towards
a
bench
against
the
adobe
wall
where
is
he
she
said
where
is
he
david
the
suddenness
of
the
question
staggered
me
i
hesitated
i
do
not
know
i
answered
i
could
not
look
into
her
face
and
say
it
the
years
of
torment
and
suffering
were
written
there
in
characters
not
to
be
mistaken
sarah
temple
the
beauty
was
dead
indeed
the
hope
which
threatened
to
light
again
the
dead
fires
in
the
woman
s
eyes
frightened
me
ah
she
said
sharply
you
are
deceiving
me
it
is
not
like
you
david
you
are
deceiving
me
tell
me
tell
me
for
the
love
of
god
who
has
brought
me
to
bear
and
she
gripped
my
arm
with
a
strength
i
had
not
thought
in
her
listen
i
said
trying
to
calm
myself
as
well
as
her
listen
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
call
her
otherwise
you
are
keeping
him
away
from
me
she
cried
why
are
you
keeping
him
away
have
i
not
suffered
enough
david
i
can
not
live
long
i
do
not
dare
to
die
until
he
has
forgiven
i
forced
her
gently
as
i
might
to
sit
on
the
bench
and
i
seated
myself
beside
her
listen
i
said
with
a
sternness
that
hid
my
feelings
and
perforce
her
expression
changed
again
to
a
sad
yearning
you
must
hear
me
and
you
must
trust
me
for
i
have
never
pretended
you
shall
see
him
if
it
is
in
my
she
looked
at
me
so
piteously
that
i
was
near
to
being
unmanned
i
will
trust
you
she
whispered
i
have
seen
him
i
said
she
started
violently
but
i
laid
my
hand
on
hers
and
by
some
that
was
still
in
her
she
was
silent
i
saw
him
in
louisville
a
month
ago
when
i
returned
from
a
year
s
visit
to
i
could
not
equivocate
with
this
woman
i
could
no
more
lie
to
her
sorrow
than
to
the
judgment
why
had
i
not
foreseen
her
question
and
he
hates
me
she
spoke
with
a
calmness
now
that
frightened
me
more
than
her
agitation
had
done
i
do
not
know
i
answered
when
i
would
have
spoken
to
him
he
was
he
was
drunk
she
said
i
stared
at
her
in
frightened
wonderment
he
was
drunk
it
is
better
than
if
he
had
cursed
me
he
did
not
mention
me
or
any
one
he
did
not
i
answered
she
turned
her
face
away
go
on
i
will
listen
to
you
she
said
and
sat
immovable
through
the
whole
of
my
story
though
her
hand
trembled
in
mine
and
while
i
live
i
hope
never
to
have
such
a
thing
to
go
through
with
again
truth
held
me
to
the
full
ludicrous
tragedy
of
the
tale
to
the
cheap
character
of
my
old
colonel
s
undertaking
to
the
incident
of
the
drum
to
the
conversation
in
my
room
likewise
truth
forbade
me
to
rekindle
her
hope
i
did
not
tell
her
that
nick
had
come
with
gré
to
new
orleans
for
of
this
my
own
knowledge
was
as
yet
not
positive
for
a
long
time
after
i
had
finished
she
was
silent
and
you
think
the
expedition
will
not
get
here
she
asked
finally
in
a
dead
voice
i
am
positive
of
it
i
answered
and
for
the
sake
of
those
who
are
engaged
in
it
it
is
mercifully
best
that
it
should
not
the
day
may
come
i
added
for
the
sake
of
leading
her
away
when
kentucky
will
be
strong
enough
to
overrun
louisiana
but
not
she
turned
to
me
with
a
trace
of
her
former
fierceness
why
are
you
in
new
orleans
she
demanded
a
sudden
resolution
came
to
me
then
to
bring
you
back
with
me
to
kentucky
i
answered
she
shook
her
head
sadly
but
i
continued
i
have
more
to
say
i
am
convinced
that
neither
nick
nor
you
will
be
happy
until
you
are
mother
and
son
again
you
have
both
been
wanderers
long
once
more
she
turned
away
and
fell
into
a
revery
over
the
housetop
from
across
the
street
came
the
gay
music
of
the
fiddler
temple
laid
her
hand
gently
on
my
shoulder
my
dear
she
said
smiling
i
could
not
live
for
the
you
must
live
for
it
i
answered
you
have
the
will
you
must
live
for
it
for
his
she
shook
her
head
and
smiled
at
me
with
a
courage
which
was
the
crown
of
her
sufferings
you
are
talking
nonsense
david
she
said
it
is
not
like
you
come
she
said
rising
with
something
of
her
old
manner
i
must
show
you
what
i
have
been
doing
all
these
years
you
must
admire
my
i
followed
her
marvelling
along
the
shell
path
and
there
came
unbidden
to
my
mind
the
garden
at
temple
bow
where
she
had
once
been
wont
to
sit
tormenting
mason
or
bending
to
the
tale
of
harry
riddle
s
love
little
she
cared
for
flowers
in
those
days
and
now
they
had
become
her
life
with
such
thoughts
in
my
mind
i
listened
unheeding
to
her
talk
the
place
was
formerly
occupied
by
a
shiftless
fellow
a
tailor
and
the
court
now
a
paradise
had
been
a
rubbish
heap
that
orange
tree
which
shaded
the
uneven
doorway
of
the
kitchen
she
had
found
here
figs
pomegranates
magnolias
the
camellias
dazzling
in
their
purity
the
oleanders
the
pink
roses
that
hid
the
crumbling
adobe
and
climbed
even
to
the
sloping
tiles
all
these
had
been
set
out
and
cared
for
with
her
own
hands
ay
and
the
fragrant
bed
of
yellow
jasmine
over
which
she
lingered
antoinette
s
favorite
flower
antoinette
s
flowers
that
she
wore
in
her
hair
in
her
letters
temple
had
never
mentioned
antoinette
and
now
she
read
the
question
perchance
purposely
put
there
in
my
eyes
her
voice
faltered
sadly
scarce
a
week
had
she
been
in
the
house
before
antoinette
had
found
her
i
i
sent
the
girl
away
david
she
came
without
monsieur
de
gré
s
knowledge
without
his
consent
it
is
natural
that
he
thinks
me
i
will
not
say
what
i
sent
antoinette
away
she
clung
to
me
she
would
not
go
and
i
had
to
be
cruel
it
is
one
of
the
things
which
make
the
nights
long
so
long
my
sins
have
made
her
life
and
you
hear
of
her
she
is
not
married
i
asked
no
she
is
not
married
said
temple
stooping
over
the
jasmines
then
she
straightened
and
faced
me
her
voice
shaken
with
earnestness
david
do
you
think
that
nick
still
loves
her
alas
i
could
not
answer
that
she
bent
over
the
jasmines
again
there
were
five
years
that
i
knew
nothing
she
continued
i
did
not
dare
ask
clark
who
comes
to
me
on
business
as
you
know
it
was
clark
who
brought
back
lindy
on
one
of
his
trips
to
charleston
and
then
one
day
in
march
of
this
year
madame
de
montméry
madame
de
montméry
i
repeated
it
is
a
strange
story
said
temple
lindy
had
never
admitted
any
one
save
clark
one
day
early
in
the
spring
when
i
was
trimming
my
roses
by
the
wall
there
the
girl
ran
to
me
and
said
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
me
why
had
she
let
her
in
lindy
did
not
know
she
could
not
refuse
her
had
the
lady
demanded
admittance
lindy
thought
that
i
would
like
to
see
her
david
it
was
a
providential
weakness
or
curiosity
that
prompted
me
to
go
into
the
front
room
and
then
i
saw
why
lindy
had
opened
the
door
to
her
who
she
is
or
what
she
is
i
do
not
know
to
this
day
who
am
i
now
that
i
should
inquire
i
know
that
she
is
a
lady
that
she
has
exquisite
manners
that
i
feel
now
that
i
can
not
live
without
her
she
comes
every
week
sometimes
twice
she
brings
me
little
delicacies
new
seeds
for
my
garden
but
best
of
all
she
brings
me
herself
and
i
am
always
counting
the
days
until
she
comes
again
yes
and
i
always
fear
that
she
too
will
be
taken
away
from
i
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
voices
but
temple
turned
startled
and
looked
towards
the
house
i
followed
her
glance
and
suddenly
i
knew
that
my
heart
was
beating
chapter
vi
madame
la
vicomtesse
hesitating
on
the
step
a
lady
stood
in
the
doorway
a
study
in
black
and
white
in
a
frame
of
pink
roses
the
sash
at
her
waist
the
lace
mantilla
that
clung
about
her
throat
the
deftly
coiled
hair
with
its
sheen
of
the
night
waters
these
in
black
the
simple
gown
a
tribute
to
the
art
of
her
countrywomen
in
white
temple
had
gone
forward
to
meet
her
but
i
stood
staring
marvelling
forgetful
in
the
path
they
were
talking
they
were
coming
towards
me
and
i
heard
temple
pronounce
my
name
and
hers
madame
de
montméry
i
bowed
she
courtesied
there
was
a
baffling
light
in
the
lady
s
brown
eyes
when
i
dared
to
glance
at
them
and
a
smile
playing
around
her
mouth
was
there
no
word
in
the
two
languages
to
find
its
way
to
my
lips
temple
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
david
is
not
what
one
might
call
a
ladies
man
madame
she
said
the
lady
laughed
isn
t
he
she
said
i
am
sure
you
will
frighten
him
with
your
wit
answered
temple
smiling
he
is
worth
he
is
worth
frightening
then
said
the
lady
in
exquisite
english
and
she
looked
at
me
again
you
and
david
should
like
each
other
said
temple
you
are
both
capable
persons
friends
of
the
friendless
and
towers
of
strength
to
the
the
lady
s
face
became
serious
but
still
there
was
the
expression
i
could
not
make
out
in
an
instant
she
seemed
to
have
scrutinized
me
with
a
precision
from
which
there
could
be
no
appeal
i
seem
to
know
ritchie
she
said
and
added
quickly
mrs
clive
has
talked
a
great
deal
about
you
she
has
made
you
out
a
very
wonderful
my
dear
said
temple
the
wonderful
people
of
this
world
are
those
who
find
time
to
comfort
and
help
the
unfortunate
that
is
why
you
and
david
are
wonderful
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
easy
it
is
to
be
i
have
brought
you
an
english
novel
said
madame
de
montoméry
turning
abruptly
to
temple
but
you
must
not
read
it
at
night
lindy
is
not
to
let
you
have
it
until
there
said
temple
gayly
to
me
madame
is
not
happy
unless
she
is
controlling
some
one
and
i
am
a
rebellious
you
have
not
been
taking
care
of
yourself
said
madame
she
glanced
at
me
and
bit
her
lips
as
though
guessing
the
emotion
which
my
visit
had
caused
listen
she
said
the
vesper
bells
you
must
go
into
the
house
and
ritchie
and
i
must
leave
she
took
temple
by
the
arm
and
led
her
unresisting
along
the
path
i
followed
a
thousand
thoughts
and
conjectures
spinning
in
my
brain
they
reached
the
bench
under
the
little
tree
beside
the
door
and
stood
talking
for
a
moment
of
the
routine
of
temple
s
life
madame
it
seemed
had
prescribed
a
regimen
and
meant
to
have
it
followed
suddenly
i
saw
temple
take
the
lady
s
arm
and
sink
down
upon
the
bench
then
we
were
both
beside
her
bending
over
her
she
sitting
upright
and
smiling
at
us
it
is
nothing
she
said
i
am
so
easily
her
lips
were
ashen
and
her
breath
came
quickly
madame
acted
with
that
instant
promptness
which
i
expected
of
her
you
must
carry
her
in
ritchie
she
said
quietly
no
it
is
only
momentary
david
said
temple
i
remember
how
pitifully
frail
and
light
she
was
as
i
picked
her
up
and
followed
madame
through
the
doorway
into
the
little
bedroom
i
laid
temple
on
the
bed
send
lindy
here
said
madame
lindy
was
in
the
front
room
with
the
negress
whom
madame
had
brought
with
her
they
were
not
talking
i
supposed
then
this
was
because
lindy
did
not
speak
french
i
did
not
know
that
madame
de
montméry
s
maid
was
a
mute
both
of
them
went
into
the
bedroom
and
i
was
left
alone
the
door
and
windows
were
closed
and
a
green
candle
was
burning
on
the
table
i
looked
about
me
with
astonishment
but
for
the
low
ceiling
and
the
wide
cypress
puncheons
of
the
floor
the
room
might
have
been
a
budoir
in
a
on
the
polished
mahogany
table
lay
books
in
tasteful
bindings
a
bookcase
stood
in
the
corner
a
fauteuil
and
various
other
chairs
which
might
have
come
from
the
hands
of
an
adam
were
ranged
about
tall
silver
candlesticks
graced
each
end
of
the
little
and
between
them
were
two
lowestoft
vases
having
the
temple
coat
of
arms
it
might
have
been
half
an
hour
that
i
waited
now
pacing
the
floor
now
throwing
myself
into
the
by
the
fireplace
anxiety
for
temple
problems
that
lost
themselves
in
a
dozen
conjectures
all
idle
these
agitated
me
almost
beyond
my
power
of
once
i
felt
for
the
miniature
took
it
out
and
put
it
back
without
looking
at
it
at
last
i
was
startled
to
my
feet
by
the
opening
of
the
door
and
madame
de
montméry
came
in
she
closed
the
door
softly
behind
her
with
the
deft
quickness
and
decision
of
movement
which
a
sixth
sense
had
told
me
she
possessed
crossed
the
room
swiftly
and
stood
confronting
me
she
is
easy
again
now
she
said
simply
it
is
one
of
her
attacks
i
wish
you
might
have
seen
me
before
you
told
her
what
you
had
to
say
to
i
wish
indeed
that
i
had
known
you
were
she
ignored
this
whether
intentionally
i
know
not
it
is
her
heart
poor
lady
i
am
afraid
she
can
not
live
she
seated
herself
in
one
of
the
straight
chairs
sit
down
ritchie
she
said
i
am
glad
you
waited
i
wanted
to
talk
with
i
thought
that
you
might
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
answered
she
made
no
gesture
either
of
surprise
or
displeasure
so
you
knew
she
said
quietly
i
knew
you
the
moment
you
appeared
in
the
doorway
i
replied
it
was
not
just
what
i
meant
to
say
there
flashed
over
her
face
that
expression
of
the
miniature
the
mouth
repressing
the
laughter
in
the
brown
eyes
montméry
is
one
of
my
husband
s
places
she
said
when
antoinette
asked
me
to
come
here
and
watch
over
temple
i
chose
the
and
temple
has
never
suspected
you
i
think
not
she
thinks
i
came
at
clark
s
request
and
being
a
lady
she
does
not
ask
questions
she
accepts
me
for
what
i
appear
to
it
seemed
so
strange
to
me
to
be
talking
here
in
new
orleans
in
this
little
spanish
house
with
a
french
vicomtesse
brought
up
near
the
court
of
the
unfortunate
marie
antoinette
nay
with
hélène
de
gré
whose
portrait
had
twice
come
into
my
life
by
a
kind
of
strange
fatality
and
was
at
that
moment
in
my
pocket
that
i
could
scarce
maintain
my
in
her
presence
i
had
given
the
portrait
too
attributes
and
a
character
and
i
found
myself
watching
the
lady
with
a
breathless
interest
lest
she
should
fail
in
any
of
these
in
the
intimacy
of
the
little
room
i
felt
as
if
i
had
known
her
always
and
again
that
she
was
as
distant
from
me
and
my
life
as
the
court
from
which
she
had
come
i
found
myself
glancing
continually
at
her
face
on
which
the
shone
the
vicomtesse
might
have
been
four
and
twenty
save
for
the
soberer
gown
she
wore
she
seemed
scarce
older
than
the
young
girl
in
the
miniature
who
had
the
presence
of
a
woman
of
the
world
suddenly
i
discovered
with
a
flush
that
she
was
looking
at
me
intently
without
embarrassment
but
with
an
expression
that
seemed
to
hint
of
humor
in
the
situation
to
my
astonishment
she
laughed
a
little
you
are
a
very
odd
person
ritchie
she
said
i
have
heard
so
much
of
you
from
temple
from
antoinette
that
i
know
something
of
your
strange
life
after
all
she
added
with
a
trace
of
sadness
it
has
been
no
stranger
than
my
own
first
i
will
answer
your
questions
and
then
i
shall
ask
but
i
have
asked
no
questions
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
said
and
you
are
a
very
simple
person
ritchie
continued
madame
la
vicomtesse
smiling
it
is
what
i
had
been
led
to
suppose
a
serious
person
as
the
friend
of
nicholas
temple
as
the
relation
and
may
i
say
benefactor
of
this
poor
lady
here
it
is
fitting
that
you
should
know
certain
things
i
will
not
weary
you
with
the
reasons
and
events
which
led
to
my
coming
from
europe
to
new
orleans
except
to
say
that
i
like
all
of
my
class
who
have
escaped
the
horrors
of
the
revolution
am
a
wanderer
and
grateful
to
monsieur
de
gré
for
the
shelter
he
gives
me
his
letter
reached
me
in
england
and
i
arrived
three
months
she
hesitated
nay
i
should
rather
say
paused
for
there
was
little
hesitation
in
what
she
did
she
paused
as
though
weighing
what
she
was
to
say
next
when
i
came
to
les
îles
i
saw
that
there
was
a
sorrow
weighing
upon
the
family
and
it
took
no
great
astuteness
on
my
part
ritchie
to
discover
that
antoinette
was
the
cause
of
it
one
has
only
to
see
antoinette
to
love
her
i
wondered
why
she
had
not
married
and
yet
i
saw
that
there
had
been
an
affair
it
seemed
very
strange
to
me
ritchie
for
with
us
you
understand
marriages
are
arranged
antoinette
really
has
beauty
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
man
of
importance
in
the
colony
her
strength
of
character
saves
her
from
being
listless
i
found
a
girl
with
originality
of
expression
with
a
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
devoted
to
charitable
works
who
had
not
taken
the
veil
that
was
on
her
father
s
account
as
you
know
they
are
inseparable
monsieur
philippe
de
gré
is
a
remarkable
man
with
certain
vigorous
ideas
not
in
accordance
with
the
customs
of
his
neighbors
it
was
he
who
first
confided
in
me
that
he
would
not
force
antoinette
to
marry
it
was
she
at
length
who
told
me
the
story
of
nicholas
temple
and
his
she
paused
again
and
reading
between
the
lines
i
perceived
that
madame
la
vicomtesse
had
become
essential
to
the
household
at
les
îles
philippe
de
gré
was
not
a
man
to
misplace
a
confidence
it
was
then
that
i
first
heard
of
you
ritchie
and
of
the
part
which
you
played
in
that
affair
it
was
then
i
had
my
first
real
insight
into
antoinette
s
character
her
affection
for
temple
astonished
me
bewildered
me
the
woman
had
deceived
her
and
her
family
and
yet
antoinette
gave
up
her
lover
because
he
would
not
take
his
mother
back
had
temple
been
willing
to
return
to
les
îles
after
you
had
providentially
taken
her
away
they
would
have
received
her
philippe
de
gré
is
not
a
man
to
listen
to
criticism
as
it
was
antoinette
did
not
rest
until
she
found
where
temple
had
hidden
herself
and
then
she
came
here
to
her
it
is
not
for
us
to
judge
any
of
them
in
sending
antoinette
away
the
poor
lady
denied
herself
the
only
consolation
that
was
left
to
her
antoinette
understood
every
week
she
has
had
news
of
temple
from
clark
and
when
i
came
and
learned
her
trouble
antoinette
begged
me
to
come
here
and
be
temple
s
friend
ritchie
she
is
a
very
ill
woman
and
a
very
sad
woman
the
saddest
woman
i
have
ever
known
and
i
have
seen
and
mademoiselle
de
gré
i
asked
tell
me
about
this
man
for
whom
antoinette
has
ruined
her
life
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
brusquely
is
he
worth
it
no
no
man
is
worth
what
she
has
suffered
what
has
become
of
him
where
is
he
did
you
not
tell
her
that
you
would
bring
him
back
i
said
that
i
would
bring
him
back
if
i
could
i
answered
and
i
meant
it
madame
la
vicomtesse
bit
her
lip
had
she
known
me
better
she
might
have
smiled
as
for
me
i
was
wholly
puzzled
to
account
for
these
fleeting
changes
in
her
humor
you
have
taken
a
great
deal
upon
your
shoulders
ritchie
she
said
they
are
from
all
accounts
broad
ones
there
i
was
wrong
to
be
indignant
in
your
presence
you
who
seem
to
have
spent
your
life
in
trying
to
get
others
out
of
difficulties
mercy
she
said
with
a
quick
gesture
at
my
protest
there
are
few
men
with
whom
one
might
talk
thus
in
so
short
an
acquaintance
i
love
the
girl
and
i
can
not
help
being
angry
with
temple
i
suppose
there
is
something
to
be
said
on
his
side
let
us
hear
it
i
dare
say
he
could
not
have
a
better
advocate
she
finished
with
an
indefinable
smile
i
began
at
the
wrong
end
of
my
narrative
and
it
was
some
time
before
i
had
my
facts
arranged
in
proper
sequence
i
could
not
forget
that
madame
la
vicomtesse
was
looking
at
me
fixedly
i
reviewed
nick
s
neglected
childhood
painted
as
well
as
i
might
his
temperament
and
character
his
generosity
and
fearlessness
his
recklessness
and
improvidence
his
loyalty
to
those
he
loved
his
detestation
of
those
he
hated
i
told
how
under
these
conditions
the
sins
and
vagaries
of
his
parents
had
gone
far
to
wreck
his
life
at
the
beginning
of
it
i
told
how
i
had
found
him
again
with
sevier
how
he
had
come
to
new
orleans
with
me
the
first
time
how
he
had
loved
antoinette
and
how
he
had
disappeared
after
the
dreadful
scene
in
the
garden
at
les
îles
how
i
had
not
seen
him
again
for
five
years
here
i
hesitated
little
knowing
how
to
tell
the
vicomtesse
of
that
affair
in
louisville
though
i
had
a
sense
that
i
could
not
keep
the
truth
from
so
discerning
a
person
i
was
startled
to
find
this
to
be
so
yes
yes
i
understand
she
said
quickly
and
in
the
morning
he
had
flown
with
that
most
worthy
of
my
relatives
auguste
de
i
looked
at
her
finding
no
words
to
express
my
astonishment
at
this
perspicacity
and
now
what
do
you
intend
to
do
she
asked
find
him
in
new
orleans
if
you
can
of
course
but
how
she
rose
quickly
went
to
the
fireplace
and
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
back
to
me
suddenly
she
turned
it
ought
not
to
be
difficult
after
all
auguste
de
gré
is
a
fool
and
he
confirms
what
you
say
of
the
expedition
he
is
indeed
a
pretty
person
to
choose
for
an
intrigue
of
this
kind
and
your
cousin
what
shall
we
call
him
to
say
the
least
secrecy
is
not
nick
s
forte
i
answered
catching
her
mood
she
was
silent
awhile
it
would
be
a
blessing
if
monsieur
le
baron
could
hang
auguste
privately
as
for
your
cousin
he
may
be
worth
saving
after
all
i
know
monsieur
de
carondelet
and
he
has
no
patience
with
conspirators
of
this
sort
i
think
he
would
not
hesitate
to
make
examples
of
them
however
we
will
try
to
save
we
i
repeated
unwittingly
madame
la
vicomtesse
looked
at
me
and
laughed
outright
yes
she
said
you
will
do
some
things
i
others
there
are
the
gaming
clubs
with
their
ridiculous
names
l
amour
la
mignonne
la
désirée
she
counted
them
reflectively
on
her
fingers
both
of
our
gentlemen
might
be
tempted
into
one
of
these
you
will
drop
into
them
ritchie
then
there
is
madame
bouvet
auguste
would
scarcely
go
there
i
objected
ah
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
but
madame
bouvet
will
know
the
names
of
some
of
auguste
s
intimates
this
bouvet
is
evidently
a
good
person
perhaps
she
will
do
more
for
you
i
understand
that
she
has
a
weak
spot
in
her
heart
for
madame
la
vicomtesse
turned
her
back
again
had
she
heard
how
madame
bouvet
had
begged
me
to
buy
the
miniature
have
you
any
other
suggestions
to
make
she
said
putting
a
foot
on
the
fender
they
have
all
been
yours
so
far
i
answered
and
yet
you
are
a
man
of
action
of
expedients
she
murmured
without
turning
where
are
your
wits
ritchie
have
you
any
plan
i
have
been
so
used
to
rely
on
myself
madame
i
replied
that
you
do
not
like
to
have
your
affairs
meddled
with
by
a
woman
she
said
into
the
fireplace
i
give
you
the
credit
to
believe
that
you
are
too
clever
to
misunderstand
me
madame
i
said
you
must
know
that
your
help
is
most
at
that
she
swung
around
and
regarded
me
strangely
mirth
lurking
in
her
eyes
she
seemed
about
to
retort
and
then
to
conquer
the
impulse
the
effect
of
this
was
to
make
me
anything
but
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
and
for
a
little
while
she
was
silent
suppose
we
do
find
them
she
said
suddenly
what
shall
we
do
with
them
she
looked
up
at
me
questioningly
seriously
is
it
likely
that
your
temple
will
be
reconciled
with
his
mother
is
it
likely
that
he
is
still
in
love
with
antoinette
i
think
it
is
likely
that
he
is
still
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
gré
i
answered
though
i
have
no
reason
for
saying
you
are
very
honest
ritchie
we
must
look
at
this
problem
from
all
sides
if
he
is
not
reconciled
with
his
mother
antoinette
will
not
receive
him
and
if
he
is
we
have
the
question
to
consider
whether
he
is
still
worthy
of
her
the
agents
of
providence
must
not
be
heedless
she
added
with
a
smile
i
am
sure
that
nick
would
alter
his
life
if
it
became
worth
living
i
said
i
will
answer
for
that
then
he
must
be
reconciled
with
his
mother
she
replied
with
decision
mrs
temple
has
suffered
enough
and
he
must
be
found
before
he
gets
sufficiently
into
the
bad
graces
of
the
baron
de
carondelet
these
two
things
are
she
rose
come
here
evening
at
the
same
she
started
quickly
for
the
bedroom
door
but
something
troubled
me
still
madame
i
said
yes
she
answered
turning
quickly
i
did
not
know
how
to
begin
there
were
many
things
i
wished
to
say
to
know
but
she
was
a
woman
whose
mind
seemed
to
leap
the
chasms
whose
words
touched
only
upon
those
points
which
might
not
be
understood
she
regarded
me
with
seeming
patience
i
should
think
that
temple
might
have
recognized
you
i
said
for
want
of
a
better
opening
from
the
miniature
she
said
i
flushed
furiously
and
it
seemed
to
burn
me
through
the
lining
of
my
pocket
that
was
my
salvation
she
said
mrs
temple
has
never
seen
the
miniature
i
have
heard
how
you
rescued
it
ritchie
she
added
with
a
curious
smile
monsieur
philippe
de
gré
told
then
he
knew
i
stammered
she
laughed
i
have
told
you
that
you
are
a
very
simple
person
she
said
even
you
are
not
given
to
intrigues
i
thank
you
for
rescuing
i
flushed
more
hotly
than
before
i
never
expected
to
see
you
i
said
it
must
have
been
a
shock
she
said
i
was
dumb
i
had
my
hand
in
my
coat
i
fully
intended
to
give
her
the
miniature
it
was
my
plain
duty
and
suddenly
overwhelmed
i
remembered
that
it
was
wrapped
in
polly
ann
s
silk
handkerchief
madame
la
vicomtesse
remained
for
a
moment
where
she
was
do
not
do
anything
until
the
morning
she
said
you
must
go
back
to
your
lodgings
at
that
would
be
to
lose
time
i
answered
you
must
think
of
yourself
a
little
she
said
do
as
i
say
i
have
heard
that
two
cases
of
the
yellow
fever
have
broken
out
this
afternoon
and
you
who
are
not
used
to
the
climate
must
not
be
out
after
and
you
i
said
i
am
used
to
it
she
replied
i
have
been
here
three
months
lest
anything
should
happen
it
might
be
well
for
you
to
give
me
your
i
am
with
madame
gravois
in
the
rue
madame
gravois
in
the
rue
bienville
she
repeated
i
shall
remember
à
demain
she
courtesied
and
went
swiftly
into
temple
s
room
seizing
my
hat
i
opened
the
door
and
found
myself
in
the
dark
street
chapter
vii
the
disposal
of
the
sieur
de
gre
i
had
met
hélène
de
gré
at
last
and
what
a
fool
she
must
think
me
as
i
hurried
along
the
dark
banquettes
this
thought
filled
my
brain
for
a
time
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
so
strongly
is
vanity
ingrained
in
us
after
all
what
did
it
matter
what
she
thought
madame
la
vicomtesse
d
i
had
never
shone
and
it
was
rather
late
to
begin
but
i
possessed
at
least
average
common
sense
and
i
had
given
no
proof
even
of
this
i
wandered
on
not
heeding
the
command
which
she
had
given
me
to
go
home
the
scent
of
camellias
and
magnolias
floated
on
the
heavy
air
of
the
night
from
the
reminding
me
of
her
laughter
and
soft
voices
came
from
the
galleries
despite
the
terror
despite
the
faubourg
despite
the
rights
of
man
and
the
wars
and
suffering
arising
therefrom
despite
the
scourge
which
might
come
life
went
gayly
on
the
cabarets
echoed
and
behind
the
tight
blinds
lines
of
light
showed
where
the
creole
gentry
gamed
at
their
tables
perchance
in
the
very
clubs
madame
la
vicomtesse
had
mentioned
the
moon
in
her
first
quarter
floated
in
a
haze
washed
by
her
light
the
quaintly
wrought
balconies
and
roofs
of
the
spanish
buildings
risen
from
the
charred
embers
took
on
a
touch
of
romance
i
paused
once
with
a
twinge
of
remembrance
before
the
long
line
of
the
ursuline
convent
with
its
latticed
belfry
against
the
sky
there
was
the
lodge
with
its
iron
gates
shut
and
the
wall
which
nick
had
threatened
to
climb
as
i
passed
the
great
square
of
the
new
barracks
a
sereno
so
the
night
watchmen
were
called
was
crying
the
hour
i
came
to
the
rambling
casting
black
shadows
on
the
river
road
empty
now
to
be
filled
in
the
morning
with
shouting
marchands
the
promenade
under
the
willows
was
deserted
the
great
river
stretched
away
under
the
moon
towards
the
forest
line
of
the
farther
shore
filmy
and
indistinct
a
black
wisp
of
smoke
rose
from
the
gunwale
of
a
flatboat
and
i
stopped
to
listen
to
the
weird
song
of
a
negro
which
i
have
heard
many
times
since
caroline
in
dé
tois
qui

ça
yé
comme
ça
ma

gaining
the
promenade
i
came
presently
to
the
new
hotel
which
had
been
built
for
the
governor
with
its
balconied
windows
looking
across
the
river
the
mansion
of
monsieur
le
baron
de
carondelet
even
as
i
sat
on
the
bench
in
the
shadow
of
the
willows
watching
the
sentry
who
paced
before
the
arched
entrance
i
caught
sight
of
a
man
stealing
along
the
banquette
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
twice
he
paused
to
look
behind
him
and
when
he
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
he
stopped
for
some
time
to
survey
the
governor
s
house
opposite
suddenly
i
was
on
my
feet
every
sense
alert
staring
in
the
moonlight
made
milky
by
the
haze
he
was
indistinct
and
yet
i
could
have
taken
oath
that
the
square
diminutive
figure
with
the
head
set
forward
on
the
shoulders
was
gignoux
s
if
this
man
were
not
gignoux
then
the
lord
had
cast
two
in
a
strange
mould
and
what
was
gignoux
doing
in
new
orleans
as
if
in
answer
to
the
question
two
men
emerged
from
the
dark
archway
of
the
governor
s
house
passed
the
sentry
and
stood
for
an
instant
on
the
edge
of
the
shadow
one
wore
a
long
spanish
cloak
and
the
other
a
uniform
that
i
could
not
make
out
a
word
was
spoken
and
then
my
man
was
ambling
across
to
meet
them
and
the
three
walked
away
up
toulouse
street
i
was
in
a
fire
of
conjecture
i
did
not
dare
to
pass
the
sentry
and
follow
them
so
i
made
round
as
fast
as
i
could
by
the
rue
pierre
which
borders
the
place
d
armes
and
then
crossed
to
toulouse
again
by
chartres
the
three
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
i
paused
on
the
corner
for
thought
and
at
length
came
to
a
reluctant
but
prudent
conclusion
that
i
had
best
go
back
to
my
lodging
and
seek
monsieur
early
in
the
morning
madame
gravois
was
awaiting
me
was
monsieur
mad
to
remain
out
at
night
had
monsieur
not
heard
of
the
yellow
fever
madame
gravois
even
had
prepared
some
concoction
which
she
poured
out
of
a
bottle
and
which
i
took
with
the
docility
of
a
child
monsieur
vigo
had
called
and
there
was
a
note
a
note
it
was
a
small
note
i
glanced
stupidly
at
the
seal
recognized
the
swan
of
the
gré
crest
broke
it
and
read
mr
ritchie
will
confer
a
favor
upon
la
vicomtesse
d
if
he
will
come
to
monsieur
de
gré
s
house
at
eight
i
bade
the
reluctant
madame
gravois
good
night
gained
my
room
threw
off
my
clothes
and
covered
myself
with
the
mosquito
bar
there
was
no
question
of
sleep
for
the
events
of
the
day
and
surmises
for
the
morrow
tortured
me
as
i
tossed
in
the
heat
had
the
man
been
gignoux
if
so
he
was
in
league
with
carondelet
s
police
i
believed
him
fully
capable
of
this
and
if
he
knew
nick
s
whereabouts
and
gré
s
they
would
both
be
behind
the
iron
gateway
of
the
calabozo
in
the
morning
monsieur
vigo
had
pointed
out
to
me
that
day
the
gloomy
prison
in
the
rear
of
the
cabildo
ay
and
he
had
spoken
of
its
instruments
of
torture
what
could
the
vicomtesse
want
truly
i
thought
with
remorse
she
had
been
more
industrious
than
i
fell
at
length
into
a
fevered
sleep
and
awoke
athirst
with
the
light
trickling
through
my
lattices
contrary
to
madame
gravois
s
orders
i
had
opened
the
glass
of
my
window
glancing
at
my
watch
which
i
had
bought
in
philadelphia
i
saw
that
the
hands
pointed
to
half
after
seven
i
had
scarcely
finished
my
toilet
before
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
madame
gravois
entered
with
a
steaming
cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
her
bottle
of
medicine
in
the
other
i
did
not
wake
monsieur
she
said
for
he
was
she
gave
me
another
dose
of
the
medicine
made
me
drink
two
cups
of
coffee
and
then
i
started
out
with
all
despatch
for
the
house
of
the
lions
as
i
turned
into
the
rue
chartres
i
saw
ahead
of
me
four
horses
with
their
bridles
bunched
and
held
by
a
negro
lad
waiting
in
the
street
yes
they
were
in
front
of
the
house
there
it
was
with
its
solid
green
gates
between
the
lions
its
yellow
walls
with
the
fringe
of
peeping
magnolias
and
oranges
with
its
gallery
from
which
monsieur
auguste
had
let
himself
down
after
stealing
the
miniature
i
knocked
at
the
wicket
the
same
gardienne
answered
the
call
smiled
led
me
through
the
cool
paved
archway
which
held
in
its
frame
the
green
of
the
court
beyond
and
up
the
stairs
with
the
quaint
balustrade
which
i
had
mounted
five
years
before
to
meet
philippe
de
gré
as
i
reached
the
gallery
madame
la
vicomtesse
gowned
in
brown
linen
for
riding
rose
quickly
from
her
chair
and
came
forward
to
meet
me
you
have
news
i
asked
as
i
took
her
hand
i
have
the
kind
of
news
i
expected
she
answered
a
smile
tempering
the
gravity
of
her
face
auguste
is
as
usual
in
need
of
then
you
have
found
them
i
answered
my
voice
betraying
my
admiration
for
the
feat
madame
la
vicomtesse
shrugged
her
shoulders
slightly
i
did
nothing
she
said
from
what
you
told
me
i
suspected
that
as
soon
as
auguste
reached
louisiana
he
would
have
a
strong
desire
to
go
away
again
this
is
undoubtedly
what
has
happened
in
any
event
i
knew
that
he
would
want
money
and
that
he
would
apply
to
a
source
which
has
hitherto
never
failed
mademoiselle
antoinette
i
said
precisely
answered
madame
la
vicomtesse
when
i
reached
home
last
night
i
questioned
antoinette
and
i
discovered
that
by
a
singular
chance
a
message
from
auguste
had
already
reached
where
is
he
i
demanded
i
do
not
know
she
replied
but
he
will
be
behind
the
hedge
of
the
garden
at
les
îles
at
eleven
o
clock
unless
he
has
lost
before
then
his
love
of
which
is
to
say
he
will
be
there
unless
he
is
dead
that
is
why
i
sent
for
you
she
glanced
at
me
sometimes
it
is
convenient
to
have
a
i
was
astounded
then
i
smiled
the
affair
was
so
ridiculously
simple
and
monsieur
de
gré
i
asked
has
been
gone
for
a
week
with
madame
to
visit
the
estimable
monsieur
poydras
at
pointe
madame
la
vicomtesse
who
had
better
use
for
her
words
than
to
waste
them
at
such
a
time
left
me
went
to
the
balcony
and
began
to
give
the
gardienne
in
the
court
below
swift
directions
in
french
then
she
turned
to
me
again
are
you
prepared
to
ride
with
antoinette
and
me
to
les
îles
monsieur
she
asked
i
am
i
answered
it
must
have
been
my
readiness
that
made
her
smile
then
her
eyes
rested
on
mine
you
look
tired
ritchie
she
said
you
did
not
obey
me
and
go
home
last
how
did
you
know
that
i
asked
with
a
thrill
at
her
interest
because
madame
gravois
told
my
messenger
that
you
were
i
was
silent
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
she
said
briefly
come
there
are
some
things
which
i
wish
to
say
to
you
before
antoinette
is
she
led
me
toward
the
end
of
the
gallery
where
a
bright
screen
of
shaded
us
from
the
sun
but
we
had
scarce
reached
the
place
ere
the
sound
of
steps
made
us
turn
and
there
was
mademoiselle
antoinette
herself
facing
us
i
went
forward
a
few
steps
hesitated
and
bowed
she
courtesied
my
name
faltering
on
her
lips
yes
it
was
antoinette
not
the
girl
whom
we
had
heard
singing
ma
luron
in
the
garden
but
a
woman
now
with
a
strange
beauty
that
astonished
me
hers
was
the
dignity
that
comes
from
unselfish
service
the
calm
that
is
far
from
resignation
though
the
black
veil
caught
up
on
her
chapeau
de
paille
gave
her
the
air
of
a
sister
of
mercy
antoinette
had
inherited
the
energies
as
well
as
the
features
of
the
gré
s
yet
there
was
a
painful
moment
as
she
stood
there
striving
to
put
down
the
agitation
the
sight
of
me
gave
her
as
for
me
i
was
bereft
of
speech
not
knowing
what
to
say
or
how
far
to
go
my
last
thought
was
of
the
remarkable
quality
in
this
woman
before
me
which
had
held
her
true
to
temple
and
which
sent
her
so
courageously
to
her
duty
now
madame
la
vicomtesse
as
i
had
hoped
relieved
the
situation
she
knew
how
to
broach
a
dreaded
subject
mr
ritchie
is
going
with
us
antoinette
she
said
it
is
perhaps
best
to
explain
everything
to
him
before
we
start
i
was
about
to
tell
you
ritchie
she
continued
turning
to
me
that
auguste
has
given
no
hint
in
his
note
of
temple
s
presence
in
louisiana
and
yet
you
told
me
that
they
were
to
have
come
here
yes
i
answered
and
i
have
no
reason
to
think
they
have
i
was
merely
going
to
suggest
said
the
vicomtesse
firmly
i
was
merely
going
to
suggest
the
possibility
of
our
meeting
temple
with
it
was
antoinette
who
answered
with
a
force
that
revealed
a
new
side
of
her
character
mr
temple
will
not
be
there
she
said
flashing
a
glance
upon
us
do
you
think
he
would
come
to
me
hélène
laid
her
hand
upon
the
girl
s
arm
my
dear
i
think
nothing
she
said
quietly
but
it
is
best
for
us
to
be
prepared
against
any
surprise
remember
that
i
do
not
know
temple
and
that
you
have
not
seen
him
for
five
it
is
not
like
him
you
know
it
is
not
like
him
exclaimed
antoinette
looking
at
me
i
know
it
is
not
like
him
mademoiselle
i
replied
madame
la
vicomtesse
from
behind
the
girl
gave
me
a
significant
look
this
occurred
to
me
she
went
on
in
an
undisturbed
tone
that
temple
might
come
with
auguste
to
protest
against
the
proceeding
or
even
to
defend
himself
against
the
imputation
that
he
was
to
make
use
of
this
money
in
any
way
i
wish
you
to
realize
antoinette
before
you
decide
to
go
that
you
may
meet
temple
would
it
not
be
better
to
let
ritchie
go
alone
i
am
sure
that
we
could
find
no
better
auguste
is
here
said
antoinette
i
must
see
her
voice
caught
i
may
never
see
him
again
he
may
be
ill
he
may
be
starving
and
i
know
that
he
is
in
trouble
whether
her
voice
caught
whether
temple
is
with
him
or
not
i
mean
to
then
it
would
be
well
to
start
said
the
vicomtesse
deftly
dropping
her
veil
she
picked
up
a
riding
whip
that
lay
on
the
railing
and
descended
the
stairs
to
the
courtyard
antoinette
and
i
followed
as
we
came
through
the
archway
i
saw
andré
monsieur
de
gré
s
mulatto
holding
open
the
wicket
for
us
to
pass
he
helped
the
ladies
to
mount
the
ponies
lengthened
my
own
stirrups
for
me
swung
into
the
saddle
himself
and
then
the
four
of
us
were
picking
our
way
down
the
rue
chartres
at
an
easy
amble
turning
to
the
right
beyond
the
cool
garden
of
the
ursulines
past
the
yellow
barracks
we
came
to
the
river
front
beside
the
fortifications
a
score
of
negroes
were
sweating
there
in
the
sun
swinging
into
position
the
long
logs
for
the
palisades
nearly
completed
they
were
like
those
of
kaskaskia
and
our
own
frontier
forts
in
kentucky
with
a
ditch
in
front
of
them
seated
on
a
horse
talking
to
the
overseer
was
a
fat
little
man
in
white
linen
who
pulled
off
his
hat
and
bowed
profoundly
to
the
ladies
his
face
gave
me
a
start
and
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
seen
him
only
the
day
before
resplendent
coming
out
of
church
he
was
the
baron
de
carondelet
there
was
a
sentry
standing
under
a
where
the
royal
road
ran
through
the
gateway
behind
him
was
a
diminutive
brick
fort
with
a
dozen
little
cannon
on
top
of
it
the
sentry
came
forward
brought
his
musket
to
a
salute
and
halted
before
my
horse
you
will
have
to
show
your
passport
murmured
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
drew
the
document
from
my
pocket
it
was
signed
by
de
lemos
and
duly
countersigned
by
the
officer
of
the
port
the
man
bowed
and
i
passed
on
it
was
a
strange
silent
ride
through
the
stinging
heat
to
les
îles
the
brown
dust
hanging
behind
us
like
a
cloud
to
settle
slowly
on
the
wayside
shrubbery
across
the
levee
bank
the
river
was
low
listless
giving
off
hot
breath
like
a
monster
in
distress
the
forest
pools
were
cracked
and
dry
the
spanish
moss
was
a
haggard
gray
and
under
the
sun
was
the
haze
which
covered
the
land
like
a
saffron
mantle
at
times
a
listlessness
came
over
me
such
as
i
had
never
known
to
make
me
forget
the
presence
of
the
women
at
my
side
the
very
errand
on
which
we
rode
from
time
to
time
i
was
roused
into
admiration
of
the
horsemanship
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
for
the
restive
texas
pony
which
she
rode
was
stung
to
madness
by
the
flies
as
for
antoinette
she
glanced
neither
right
nor
left
through
her
veil
but
rode
unmindful
of
the
way
heedless
of
heat
and
discomfort
erect
motionless
save
for
the
easy
gait
of
her
horse
at
length
we
turned
into
the
avenue
through
the
forest
lined
by
wild
orange
trees
came
in
sight
of
the
low
belvedered
plantation
house
and
drew
rein
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
antoinette
was
the
first
to
dismount
and
passed
in
silence
through
the
group
of
surprised
house
servants
gathering
at
the
door
i
assisted
the
vicomtesse
who
paused
to
bid
the
negroes
disperse
and
we
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
gallery
together
poor
antoinette
she
said
i
wish
we
might
have
saved
her
she
looked
up
at
me
how
she
defended
him
she
exclaimed
she
loves
him
i
answered
madame
la
vicomtesse
sighed
i
suppose
there
is
no
help
for
it
she
said
but
it
is
very
difficult
not
to
be
angry
with
temple
the
girl
cared
for
his
mother
gave
her
a
home
clung
to
her
when
he
and
the
world
would
have
cast
her
off
sacrificed
her
happiness
for
them
both
if
i
see
him
i
believe
i
shall
shake
him
and
if
he
doesn
t
fall
down
on
his
knees
to
her
i
shall
ask
the
baron
to
hang
him
we
must
bring
him
to
his
senses
ritchie
he
must
not
leave
louisiana
until
he
sees
her
then
he
will
marry
she
paused
scrutinized
me
in
her
quick
way
and
added
you
see
that
i
take
your
estimation
of
his
character
you
ought
to
be
i
am
flattered
by
any
confidence
you
repose
in
me
madame
la
she
laughed
i
was
not
flattered
then
but
cursed
myself
for
the
quaint
awkwardness
in
my
speech
that
amused
her
and
she
was
astonishingly
quick
to
perceive
my
moods
there
don
t
be
angry
you
will
never
be
a
courtier
my
honest
friend
and
you
may
thank
god
for
it
how
sweet
the
shrubs
are
your
chief
business
in
life
seems
to
be
getting
people
out
of
trouble
and
i
am
going
to
help
you
with
this
it
was
my
turn
to
laugh
you
are
going
to
help
i
exclaimed
my
services
have
been
heavy
so
you
should
not
walk
around
at
night
she
replied
irrelevantly
suddenly
i
remembered
gignoux
but
even
as
i
was
about
to
tell
her
of
the
incident
antoinette
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
was
very
pale
but
her
lips
were
set
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
shone
strangely
she
was
still
in
her
riding
gown
in
her
hand
she
carried
a
leather
bag
and
behind
her
stood
andré
with
a
bundle
quick
she
said
we
are
wasting
time
and
he
may
be
checking
an
exclamation
which
could
hardly
have
been
complimentary
to
auguste
the
vicomtesse
crossed
quickly
to
her
and
put
her
arm
about
her
we
will
follow
you
mignonne
she
said
in
french
must
you
come
said
antoinette
appealingly
he
may
not
appear
if
he
sees
any
we
shall
have
to
risk
that
said
the
vicomtesse
dryly
with
a
glance
at
me
you
shall
not
go
alone
but
we
will
wait
a
few
moments
at
the
we
took
the
way
through
the
light
under
the
trees
antoinette
leading
and
the
sight
of
the
garden
brought
back
to
me
poignantly
the
scene
in
the
moonlight
with
temple
there
was
no
sound
save
the
languid
morning
notes
of
the
birds
and
the
humming
of
the
bees
among
the
flowers
as
antoinette
went
tremblingly
down
the
path
and
paused
listening
under
the
branches
of
that
oak
where
i
had
first
beheld
her
then
with
a
little
cry
we
saw
her
run
forward
into
the
arms
of
auguste
de
gré
it
was
a
pitiful
thing
to
look
upon
antoinette
had
led
her
brother
to
the
seat
under
the
oak
how
long
we
waited
i
know
not
but
at
length
we
heard
their
voices
raised
and
without
more
ado
madame
la
vicomtesse
beckoning
me
passed
quickly
through
the
gap
in
the
hedge
and
went
towards
them
i
followed
with
andré
auguste
rose
with
an
oath
and
then
stood
facing
his
cousin
like
a
man
struck
dumb
his
hands
dropped
he
was
a
sorry
sight
indeed
unshaven
unkempt
dark
circles
under
his
eyes
clothes
torn
hélène
you
here
in
america
he
cried
in
french
staring
at
her
yes
auguste
she
replied
quite
simply
i
am
he
would
have
come
towards
her
but
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
which
arrested
him
and
monsieur
le
vicomte
henri
he
said
i
found
myself
listening
tensely
for
the
answer
henri
is
in
austria
fighting
for
his
king
i
hope
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
so
madame
la
vicomtesse
is
a
refugee
he
said
with
a
bow
and
a
smile
that
made
me
very
angry
and
monsieur
de
gré
i
asked
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
he
started
and
gave
back
for
he
had
not
perceived
me
he
recovered
his
balance
such
as
it
was
instantly
monsieur
seems
to
take
an
extraordinary
interest
in
my
affairs
he
said
jauntily
only
when
they
are
to
the
detriment
of
other
persons
who
are
my
friends
i
said
monsieur
has
intruded
in
a
family
matter
said
auguste
grandly
still
in
french
by
invitation
of
those
most
concerned
monsieur
i
answered
for
i
could
have
throttled
him
auguste
had
developed
he
had
learned
well
that
effrontery
is
often
the
best
weapon
of
an
adventurer
he
turned
from
me
disdainfully
petulantly
and
addressed
the
vicomtesse
once
more
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
antoinette
he
said
no
doubt
said
the
vicomtesse
i
demand
it
said
auguste
the
demand
is
not
granted
said
the
vicomtesse
that
is
why
we
have
come
your
sister
has
already
made
enough
sacrifices
for
you
i
know
you
monsieur
auguste
de
gré
she
continued
with
quiet
contempt
it
is
not
for
love
of
antoinette
that
you
have
sought
this
meeting
it
is
because
she
said
riding
down
a
torrent
of
words
which
began
to
escape
from
him
it
is
because
you
are
in
a
predicament
as
usual
and
you
need
hélène
it
was
antoinette
who
spoke
she
had
risen
and
was
standing
behind
auguste
she
still
held
the
leather
bag
in
her
hand
perhaps
the
sum
is
not
enough
she
said
he
has
to
get
to
france
perhaps
we
could
borrow
more
until
my
father
comes
she
looked
questioningly
at
us
madame
la
vicomtesse
was
truly
a
woman
of
decision
without
more
ado
she
took
the
bag
from
antoinette
s
unresisting
hands
and
put
it
into
mine
i
was
no
less
astonished
than
the
rest
of
them
mr
ritchie
will
keep
this
until
the
negotiations
are
finished
said
the
vicomtesse
negotiations
cried
auguste
beside
himself
this
is
insolence
be
careful
sir
i
said
auguste
cried
antoinette
putting
her
hand
on
his
arm
why
did
you
tell
them
he
demanded
turning
on
her
because
i
trust
them
auguste
antoinette
answered
she
spoke
without
anger
as
one
whose
sorrow
has
put
her
beyond
it
her
speech
had
a
dignity
and
force
which
might
have
awed
a
worthier
man
his
disappointment
and
chagrin
brought
him
beyond
bounds
you
trust
them
he
cried
you
trust
them
when
they
tell
you
to
give
your
brother
who
is
starving
and
in
peril
of
his
life
eight
hundred
livres
eight
hundred
livres
pardieu
and
your
brother
it
is
all
i
have
auguste
said
his
sister
sadly
ha
he
said
dramatically
i
see
they
seek
my
destruction
this
man
pointing
at
me
is
a
federalist
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
bowed
ironically
is
a
pish
said
the
vicomtesse
impatiently
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
have
you
sent
to
the
morro
a
word
to
monsieur
de
carondelet
auguste
do
you
believe
for
a
moment
that
in
your
father
s
absence
i
would
have
allowed
antoinette
to
come
here
alone
and
it
was
a
happy
circumstance
that
i
could
call
on
such
a
man
as
ritchie
to
come
with
it
seems
to
me
that
ritchie
and
his
friends
have
already
brought
sufficient
misfortune
on
the
it
was
a
villanous
speech
antoinette
turned
away
her
shoulders
quivering
and
i
took
a
step
towards
him
but
madame
la
vicomtesse
made
a
swift
gesture
and
i
stopped
i
know
not
why
she
gave
an
exclamation
so
sharp
that
he
flinched
physically
as
though
he
had
been
struck
but
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
when
she
began
to
speak
her
words
cut
rather
than
lashed
auguste
de
gré
she
said
i
know
you
the
tribunal
is
merciful
compared
to
you
there
is
no
one
on
earth
whom
you
would
not
torture
for
your
selfish
ends
no
one
whom
you
would
not
sell
without
compunction
for
your
pleasure
there
are
things
that
a
woman
should
not
mention
and
yet
i
would
tell
them
without
shame
to
your
face
were
it
not
for
your
sister
if
it
were
not
for
her
i
would
not
have
you
in
my
presence
shall
i
speak
of
your
career
in
france
there
is
valenciennes
for
example
she
stopped
abruptly
the
man
was
gray
but
not
on
his
account
did
the
vicomtesse
stay
her
speech
she
forgot
him
as
though
he
did
not
exist
and
by
one
of
those
swift
transitions
which
thrilled
me
had
gone
to
the
sobbing
antoinette
and
taken
her
in
her
arms
murmuring
endearments
of
which
our
language
is
not
capable
i
too
forgot
auguste
but
no
rebuke
however
stinging
could
make
him
forget
himself
and
before
we
realized
it
he
was
talking
again
he
had
changed
his
tactics
this
is
my
home
he
said
where
i
might
expect
shelter
and
comfort
you
make
me
an
antoinette
disengaged
herself
from
hélène
with
a
cry
but
he
turned
away
from
her
and
shrugged
a
stranger
would
have
fared
better
perhaps
you
will
have
more
consideration
for
a
stranger
there
is
a
french
ship
at
the
terre
aux
bœufs
in
the
english
turn
which
sails
i
appeal
to
you
ritchie
he
was
still
talking
in
french
i
appeal
to
you
who
are
a
man
of
affairs
and
he
swept
me
a
bow
if
a
captain
would
risk
taking
a
fugitive
to
france
for
eight
hundred
livres
pardieu
i
could
get
no
farther
than
the
balize
for
that
monsieur
he
added
meaningly
you
have
an
interest
in
this
there
are
two
of
us
to
the
amazing
effrontery
of
this
move
made
me
gasp
yet
it
was
neither
the
vicomtesse
nor
myself
who
answered
him
we
turned
by
common
impulse
to
antoinette
and
she
was
changed
her
breath
came
quickly
her
eyes
flashed
her
anger
made
her
magnificent
it
is
not
true
she
cried
you
know
it
is
not
he
lifted
his
shoulders
and
smiled
you
are
my
brother
and
i
am
ashamed
to
acknowledge
you
i
was
willing
to
give
my
last
sou
to
sell
my
belongings
to
take
from
the
poor
to
help
you
until
you
defamed
a
good
man
you
can
not
make
me
believe
she
cried
unheeding
the
color
that
surged
into
her
cheeks
you
can
not
make
me
believe
that
he
would
use
this
money
you
can
not
make
me
believe
let
us
do
him
the
credit
of
thinking
that
he
means
to
repay
it
said
auguste
antoinette
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
tears
of
pride
of
humiliation
ay
and
of
an
anger
of
which
i
had
not
thought
her
capable
she
was
indeed
a
superb
creature
then
a
personage
i
had
not
imagined
gathering
up
her
gown
she
passed
auguste
and
turned
on
him
swiftly
if
you
were
to
bring
that
to
him
she
said
pointing
to
the
bag
in
my
hand
he
would
not
so
much
as
touch
it
i
shall
go
to
the
ursulines
and
i
thank
god
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
thank
god
i
shall
no
longer
be
your
sister
give
monsieur
the
bundle
she
said
to
the
frightened
andré
who
still
stood
by
the
hedge
he
may
need
food
and
clothes
for
his
she
left
us
we
stood
watching
her
until
her
gown
had
disappeared
amongst
the
foliage
andré
came
forward
and
held
out
the
bundle
to
auguste
who
took
it
mechanically
then
madame
la
vicomtesse
motioned
to
andré
to
leave
and
gave
me
a
glance
and
it
was
part
of
the
deep
understanding
of
her
i
had
that
i
took
its
meaning
i
had
my
forebodings
at
what
this
last
conversation
with
auguste
might
bring
forth
and
i
wished
heartily
that
we
were
rid
of
him
monsieur
de
gré
i
said
i
understood
you
to
say
that
a
ship
is
lying
at
the
english
turn
some
five
leagues
below
us
on
which
you
are
to
take
passage
at
he
turned
and
glared
at
me
some
devilish
retort
on
his
lips
which
he
held
back
suddenly
he
became
suave
i
shall
want
two
thousand
livres
monsieur
it
was
the
sum
i
asked
it
is
not
a
question
of
what
you
asked
for
i
answered
since
when
did
monsieur
assume
this
intimate
position
in
my
family
he
said
glancing
at
the
vicomtesse
monsieur
de
gré
i
replied
with
difficulty
you
will
confine
yourself
to
the
matter
in
hand
you
are
in
no
situation
to
demand
terms
you
must
take
or
leave
what
is
offered
you
last
night
the
man
called
gignoux
who
was
of
your
party
was
at
the
governor
s
at
this
he
started
perceptibly
ha
i
thought
he
was
a
traitor
he
cried
strangely
enough
he
did
not
doubt
my
word
in
this
i
am
surprised
that
your
father
s
house
has
not
been
searched
this
morning
i
continued
astonished
at
my
own
moderation
the
sentiments
of
the
baron
de
carondelet
are
no
doubt
known
to
you
and
you
are
aware
that
your
family
or
your
friends
can
not
save
you
if
you
are
arrested
you
may
have
this
money
on
two
conditions
the
first
is
that
you
leave
the
province
immediately
the
second
that
you
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
nicholas
monsieur
is
very
kind
he
replied
and
added
the
taunt
and
well
versed
in
the
conduct
of
affairs
of
does
monsieur
de
gré
accept
i
asked
he
threw
out
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
resignation
who
am
i
to
accept
he
said
a
fugitive
an
outcast
and
i
should
like
to
remind
monsieur
that
time
it
is
a
sensible
observation
said
i
meaning
that
it
was
the
first
his
sudden
docility
made
me
suspicious
what
preparations
have
you
made
to
go
they
are
not
elaborate
monsieur
but
they
are
complete
when
i
leave
you
i
step
into
a
pirogue
which
is
tied
to
the
river
ah
i
replied
and
temple
madame
la
vicomtesse
smiled
for
auguste
was
fairly
caught
he
had
not
the
astuteness
to
be
a
rogue
oddly
he
had
the
sense
to
know
that
he
could
fool
us
no
longer
temple
is
at
lamarque
s
he
answered
sullenly
i
glanced
questioningly
at
the
vicomtesse
lamarque
is
an
old
pensioner
of
monsieur
de
gré
s
said
she
he
has
a
house
and
an
arpent
of
land
not
far
below
exactly
said
auguste
and
if
ritchie
believes
that
he
will
save
money
by
keeping
temple
in
louisiana
instead
of
giving
him
this
opportunity
to
escape
it
is
no
concern
of
i
reflected
a
moment
on
this
for
it
was
another
sensible
remark
it
is
indeed
no
concern
of
yours
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
now
he
said
i
take
it
that
there
are
no
further
conscientious
scruples
against
my
receiving
this
paltry
i
will
go
with
you
to
your
pirogue
i
answered
when
you
embark
you
shall
have
i
too
will
go
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
you
overwhelm
me
with
civility
madame
said
the
sieur
de
gré
bowing
low
lead
the
way
monsieur
i
said
he
took
his
bundle
and
started
off
down
the
garden
path
with
a
grand
air
i
looked
at
the
vicomtesse
inquiringly
and
there
was
laughter
in
her
eyes
i
must
show
you
the
way
to
lamarque
and
then
she
whispered
you
have
done
well
i
did
not
return
her
look
but
waited
until
she
took
the
path
ahead
of
me
in
silence
we
followed
auguste
through
the
depths
of
the
woods
turning
here
and
there
to
avoid
a
fallen
tree
or
a
where
the
water
still
remained
at
length
we
came
out
in
the
glare
of
the
sun
and
crossed
the
dusty
road
to
the
levee
bank
some
forty
yards
below
us
was
the
canoe
and
we
walked
to
it
still
in
silence
auguste
flung
in
his
bundle
and
turned
to
us
perhaps
monsieur
is
satisfied
he
said
i
handed
him
the
bag
and
he
took
it
with
an
elaborate
air
of
thankfulness
nay
the
rascal
opened
it
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
tricked
at
the
last
at
the
sight
of
the
gold
and
silver
which
antoinette
had
hastily
collected
he
turned
to
madame
la
vicomtesse
should
i
have
the
good
fortune
to
meet
monsieur
le
vicomte
in
france
i
shall
assure
him
that
madame
is
in
good
hands
he
swept
an
exultant
look
at
me
and
enjoying
i
could
have
flung
him
into
the
river
and
all
but
madame
la
vicomtesse
made
him
a
courtesy
there
on
the
levee
bank
and
said
sweetly
that
is
very
good
of
you
as
for
you
monsieur
he
said
and
now
his
voice
shook
with
uncontrolled
rage
i
am
in
no
condition
to
repay
your
kindnesses
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
not
object
to
keeping
the
miniature
a
while
i
was
speechless
with
anger
and
shame
and
though
i
felt
the
eyes
of
the
vicomtesse
upon
me
i
dared
not
look
at
her
i
heard
auguste
but
indistinctly
as
he
continued
should
you
need
the
frame
monsieur
you
will
doubtless
find
it
still
with
monsieur
isadore
the
jew
in
the
rue
with
that
he
leaped
into
his
boat
seized
the
paddle
and
laughed
as
he
headed
into
the
current
how
long
i
stood
watching
him
as
he
drifted
lazily
in
the
sun
i
know
not
but
at
length
the
voice
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
aroused
me
he
is
a
pleasant
person
she
said
chapter
viii
at
lamarque
s
until
then
it
seemed
as
if
the
sun
had
gotten
into
my
brain
and
set
it
on
fire
her
words
had
the
strange
effect
of
clearing
my
head
though
i
was
still
in
as
sad
a
predicament
as
ever
i
found
myself
there
was
the
thing
in
my
pocket
still
wrapped
in
polly
ann
s
handkerchief
i
glanced
at
the
vicomtesse
shyly
and
turned
away
again
her
face
was
all
repressed
laughter
the
expression
i
knew
so
well
i
think
we
should
feel
better
in
the
shade
ritchie
she
said
in
english
and
leaping
lightly
down
from
the
bank
crossed
the
road
again
i
followed
her
perforce
i
will
show
you
the
way
to
lamarque
s
she
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
cried
had
she
no
curiosity
was
she
going
to
let
pass
what
auguste
had
hinted
lifting
up
her
skirts
she
swung
round
and
faced
me
in
her
eyes
was
a
calmness
more
baffling
than
the
light
i
had
seen
there
but
a
moment
since
how
to
begin
i
knew
not
and
yet
i
was
launched
madame
la
vicomtesse
there
was
once
a
certain
miniature
painted
of
by
boze
monsieur
she
answered
readily
enough
the
embarrassment
was
all
on
my
side
we
spoke
of
it
last
evening
i
remember
well
when
it
was
taken
it
was
the
costume
i
wore
at
chantilly
and
monsieur
le
prince
complimented
me
and
the
next
day
the
painter
himself
came
to
our
hotel
in
the
rue
de
bretagne
and
asked
the
honor
of
painting
she
sighed
ah
those
were
happy
days
her
majesty
was
very
angry
with
and
why
i
asked
forgetful
of
my
predicament
for
sending
it
to
louisiana
to
and
why
did
you
send
it
a
whim
said
the
vicomtesse
i
had
always
written
twice
a
year
either
to
monsieur
de
gré
or
antoinette
and
although
i
had
never
seen
them
i
loved
them
perhaps
it
was
because
they
had
the
patience
to
read
my
letters
and
the
manners
to
say
they
liked
surely
not
madame
i
said
monsieur
de
gré
spoke
often
to
me
of
the
wonderful
pictures
you
drew
of
the
personages
at
madame
la
vicomtesse
had
an
answer
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
i
know
now
that
she
spared
me
and
what
of
this
miniature
monsieur
she
asked
what
became
of
it
after
you
restored
it
to
its
rightful
owner
i
flushed
furiously
and
fumbled
in
my
pocket
i
obtained
it
again
madame
i
said
you
obtained
it
she
cried
i
am
not
sure
to
this
day
whether
in
consternation
or
jest
in
passing
it
was
not
just
what
i
wanted
to
say
i
meant
to
give
it
you
last
night
i
said
and
why
did
you
not
she
demanded
severely
i
felt
her
eyes
on
me
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
she
were
looking
into
my
very
soul
even
had
it
been
otherwise
i
could
not
have
told
her
how
i
had
lived
with
this
picture
night
and
day
how
i
had
dreamed
of
it
how
it
had
been
my
inspiration
and
counsel
i
drew
it
from
my
pocket
wrapped
as
it
was
in
the
handkerchief
and
uncovered
it
with
a
reverence
which
she
must
have
marked
for
she
turned
away
to
pick
a
yellow
flower
by
the
roadside
i
thank
heaven
that
she
did
not
laugh
indeed
she
seemed
to
be
far
from
laughter
you
have
taken
good
care
of
it
monsieur
she
said
i
thank
it
was
not
mine
madame
i
answered
and
if
it
had
been
she
asked
it
was
a
strange
prompting
if
it
had
been
i
could
have
taken
no
better
care
of
it
i
answered
and
i
held
it
towards
her
she
took
it
simply
and
the
handkerchief
she
said
the
handkerchief
was
polly
ann
s
i
answered
she
stopped
to
pick
a
second
flower
that
had
grown
by
the
first
who
is
polly
ann
she
said
when
i
was
eleven
years
of
age
and
ran
away
from
temple
bow
after
my
father
died
polly
ann
found
me
in
the
hills
when
she
married
tom
mcchesney
they
took
me
across
the
mountains
into
kentucky
with
them
polly
ann
has
been
more
than
a
mother
to
oh
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
then
she
looked
at
me
with
a
stranger
expression
than
i
had
yet
seen
in
her
face
she
thrust
the
miniature
in
her
gown
turned
and
walked
in
silence
awhile
then
she
said
so
auguste
sold
it
again
yes
i
said
he
seems
to
have
found
a
ready
market
only
in
you
said
the
vicomtesse
without
turning
her
head
here
we
are
at
lamarque
what
i
saw
was
a
low
cabin
on
the
edge
of
a
clearing
and
behind
it
stretched
away
in
prim
rows
the
vegetables
which
the
old
frenchman
had
planted
there
was
a
little
flower
garden
too
and
an
orchard
a
path
of
beaten
earth
led
to
the
door
which
was
open
there
we
paused
seated
at
a
rude
table
was
lamarque
himself
his
hoary
head
bent
over
the
cards
he
held
in
his
hand
opposite
him
was
nicholas
temple
in
the
act
of
playing
the
ace
of
spades
i
think
that
it
was
the
laughter
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
that
first
disturbed
them
and
even
then
she
had
time
to
turn
to
me
i
like
your
cousin
she
whispered
is
that
you
gré
said
nick
i
wish
to
the
devil
you
would
learn
not
to
sneak
you
frighten
me
where
the
deuce
did
you
go
to
but
lamarque
had
seen
the
lady
stared
at
her
wildly
for
a
moment
and
rose
dropping
his
cards
on
the
floor
he
bowed
humbly
not
without
trepidation
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
said
by
this
time
nick
had
risen
and
he
too
was
staring
at
her
how
he
managed
to
appear
so
well
dressed
was
a
puzzle
to
me
madame
he
said
bowing
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
you
were
that
i
beg
your
i
understand
your
feelings
sir
answered
the
vicomtesse
as
she
courtesied
egad
said
nick
and
looked
at
her
again
egad
i
ll
be
hanged
if
it
s
not
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
the
vicomtesse
in
confusion
and
indeed
if
it
were
confusion
she
recovered
instantly
you
will
probably
be
hanged
sir
if
you
do
not
mend
your
company
she
said
do
you
not
think
so
ritchie
davy
he
cried
and
catching
sight
of
me
in
the
doorway
over
her
shoulder
has
he
followed
me
here
too
running
past
the
vicomtesse
he
seized
me
in
his
impulsive
way
and
searched
my
face
so
you
have
followed
me
here
old
faithful
madame
he
added
turning
to
the
vicomtesse
there
is
some
excuse
for
my
getting
into
what
excuse
monsieur
she
asked
she
was
smiling
yet
looking
at
us
with
shining
eyes
the
pleasure
of
having
ritchie
get
me
out
he
answered
he
has
never
failed
you
are
far
from
being
out
of
this
i
said
if
the
baron
de
carondelet
does
not
hang
you
or
put
you
in
the
morro
you
will
not
have
me
to
thank
it
will
be
madame
la
vicomtesse
d
madame
la
vicomtesse
exclaimed
nick
puzzled
may
i
present
to
you
madame
nicholas
temple
i
asked
nick
bowed
and
she
courtesied
again
so
monsieur
le
baron
is
really
after
us
said
nick
he
opened
his
eyes
slapped
his
knee
and
laughed
that
may
account
for
the
citizen
captain
de
gré
s
absence
he
said
by
the
way
davy
you
haven
t
happened
by
any
chance
to
meet
him
the
vicomtesse
and
i
exchanged
a
look
of
understanding
relief
was
plain
on
her
face
it
was
she
who
answered
we
have
met
him
by
chance
monsieur
he
has
just
left
for
terre
aux
terre
aux
bœufs
what
the
dev
i
beg
your
pardon
madame
la
vicomtesse
but
you
give
me
something
of
a
surprise
is
there
another
conspiracy
at
terre
aux
bœufs
or
does
somebody
live
there
who
has
never
before
lent
auguste
money
madame
la
vicomtesse
laughed
then
she
grew
serious
again
you
did
not
know
where
he
had
gone
she
said
i
did
not
even
know
he
had
gone
said
nick
citizen
lamarque
and
i
were
having
a
little
game
of
piquet
for
vegetables
eh
citizen
madame
la
vicomtesse
laughed
again
and
once
more
the
shade
of
sadness
came
into
her
eyes
they
are
the
same
the
world
over
she
said
not
to
me
nor
yet
to
any
one
there
and
i
knew
that
she
was
thinking
of
her
own
kind
in
france
who
faced
the
guillotine
without
sense
of
danger
she
turned
to
nick
you
may
be
interested
to
know
temple
she
added
that
auguste
is
on
his
way
to
the
english
turn
to
take
ship
for
nick
regarded
her
for
a
moment
and
then
his
face
lighted
up
with
that
smile
which
won
every
one
he
met
which
inevitably
made
them
smile
back
at
him
the
news
is
certainly
unexpected
madame
he
said
but
then
after
one
has
travelled
much
with
auguste
it
is
difficult
to
take
a
great
deal
of
interest
in
him
am
i
to
be
sent
to
france
too
he
asked
not
if
it
can
be
helped
replied
the
vicomtesse
seriously
mr
ritchie
will
tell
you
however
that
you
are
in
no
small
danger
doubtless
you
know
it
monsieur
le
baron
de
carondelet
considers
that
the
intrigues
of
the
french
revolutionists
in
louisiana
have
already
robbed
him
of
several
years
of
his
life
he
is
not
disposed
to
be
lenient
towards
persons
connected
with
that
what
have
you
been
doing
since
you
arrived
here
on
this
ridiculous
mission
i
demanded
impatiently
my
cousin
is
a
narrow
man
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
nick
we
enjoy
ourselves
in
different
ways
i
thought
there
might
be
some
excitement
in
this
matter
and
i
was
sadly
it
is
not
over
yet
said
the
vicomtesse
and
davy
continued
nick
bowing
to
me
gets
his
pleasures
and
excitement
by
extracting
me
from
my
various
entanglements
well
there
is
not
much
to
tell
gré
and
i
were
joined
above
natchez
by
that
little
pig
citizen
gignoux
and
we
shot
past
de
lemos
in
the
night
since
then
we
have
been
permitted
to
sleep
no
more
at
various
plantations
we
have
been
waked
up
at
barbarous
hours
in
the
morning
and
handed
on
as
it
were
they
were
all
fond
of
us
but
likewise
they
were
all
afraid
of
the
baron
what
day
is
monday
then
it
was
on
saturday
that
we
lost
i
have
reason
to
think
that
he
has
already
sold
out
to
the
baron
i
put
in
eh
i
saw
him
in
communication
with
the
police
at
the
governor
s
hotel
last
night
i
answered
nick
was
silent
for
a
moment
well
he
said
that
may
make
some
then
he
laughed
i
wonder
why
auguste
didn
t
think
of
doing
that
he
said
and
now
what
how
did
you
get
to
this
house
i
said
we
came
down
on
saturday
night
after
we
had
lost
gignoux
above
the
do
you
know
where
you
are
i
asked
not
i
said
nick
i
have
been
playing
piquet
with
lamarque
most
of
the
time
since
i
arrived
he
is
one
of
the
pleasantest
men
i
have
met
in
louisiana
although
a
little
taciturn
as
you
perceive
and
more
than
a
little
deaf
i
think
he
does
not
like
auguste
he
seems
to
have
known
him
in
his
madame
la
vicomtesse
looked
at
him
with
interest
you
are
at
les
îles
nick
i
said
you
are
on
monsieur
de
gré
s
plantation
and
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
his
his
face
became
grave
all
at
once
he
seized
me
by
both
shoulders
and
looked
into
my
face
you
say
that
we
are
at
les
îles
he
repeated
slowly
i
nodded
seeing
the
deception
which
auguste
had
evidently
practised
in
order
to
get
him
here
then
nick
dropped
his
arms
went
to
the
door
and
stood
for
a
long
time
with
his
back
turned
to
us
looking
out
over
the
fields
when
finally
he
spoke
it
was
in
the
tone
he
used
in
anger
if
i
had
him
now
i
think
i
would
kill
him
he
said
auguste
had
deluded
him
in
other
things
had
run
away
and
deserted
him
in
a
strange
land
but
this
matter
of
bringing
him
to
les
îles
was
past
pardon
it
was
another
face
he
turned
to
the
vicomtesse
a
stronger
face
a
face
ennobled
by
a
just
anger
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
said
i
have
a
vague
notion
that
you
are
related
to
monsieur
de
gré
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
as
a
gentleman
that
i
had
no
thought
of
trespassing
upon
him
in
any
mr
temple
we
were
so
sure
of
that
ritchie
and
i
that
we
should
not
have
sought
for
you
here
otherwise
she
replied
quickly
then
she
glanced
at
me
as
though
seeking
my
approval
for
her
next
move
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
she
did
not
now
shirk
a
task
imposed
by
her
sense
of
duty
we
have
little
time
temple
and
much
to
say
perhaps
you
will
excuse
us
lamarque
she
added
graciously
in
french
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
the
old
man
and
with
the
tact
of
his
race
he
bowed
and
retired
the
vicomtesse
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
rude
chairs
and
looked
at
nick
curiously
there
was
no
such
thing
as
embarrassment
in
her
manner
no
trace
of
misgiving
that
she
would
not
move
properly
in
the
affair
knowing
nick
as
i
did
the
difficulty
of
the
task
appalled
me
for
no
man
was
likelier
than
he
to
fly
off
at
a
misplaced
word
her
beginning
was
so
bold
that
i
held
my
breath
knowing
full
well
as
i
did
that
she
had
chosen
the
very
note
sit
down
temple
she
said
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
your
he
stopped
like
a
man
who
had
been
struck
straightened
and
stared
at
her
as
though
he
had
not
taken
her
meaning
then
he
swung
on
me
your
mother
is
in
new
orleans
i
said
i
would
have
told
you
in
louisville
had
you
given
me
the
it
is
an
interesting
piece
of
news
david
he
answered
which
you
might
have
spared
me
temple
did
not
think
herself
necessary
to
my
welfare
when
i
was
young
and
now
i
have
learned
to
live
without
is
there
no
such
thing
as
expiation
monsieur
said
the
vicomtesse
madame
he
said
she
made
me
what
i
am
and
when
i
might
have
redeemed
myself
she
came
between
me
and
monsieur
said
the
vicomtesse
have
you
ever
considered
her
sufferings
he
looked
at
the
vicomtesse
with
a
new
interest
she
was
not
so
far
beyond
his
experience
as
mine
her
sufferings
he
repeated
and
smiled
madame
la
vicomtesse
should
know
them
i
interrupted
and
without
heeding
her
glance
of
protest
i
continued
it
is
she
who
has
cared
for
you
madame
he
exclaimed
do
not
deny
your
own
share
in
it
ritchie
she
answered
as
for
me
monsieur
she
went
on
turning
to
nick
i
have
done
nothing
that
was
not
selfish
i
have
been
in
the
world
i
have
lived
my
life
misfortunes
have
come
upon
me
too
my
visits
to
your
mother
have
been
to
me
a
comfort
a
pleasure
for
she
is
a
rare
i
have
never
found
her
so
madame
he
said
briefly
i
am
sure
it
is
your
misfortune
rather
than
your
fault
temple
it
is
because
you
do
not
know
her
again
he
looked
at
me
puzzled
uneasy
like
a
man
who
would
run
if
he
could
but
by
a
kind
of
fascination
his
eyes
went
back
to
this
woman
who
dared
a
subject
sore
to
the
touch
who
pressed
it
gently
but
with
determination
never
doubting
her
powers
yet
with
a
kindness
and
sympathy
of
tone
which
few
women
of
the
world
possess
the
vicomtesse
began
to
speak
again
evenly
gently
mr
temple
said
she
i
am
merely
going
to
tell
you
some
things
which
i
am
sure
you
do
not
know
and
when
i
have
finished
i
shall
not
appeal
to
you
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
try
to
influence
you
and
from
what
ritchie
and
others
have
told
me
of
your
character
i
am
sure
that
no
influence
will
be
necessary
and
she
added
with
a
smile
it
would
be
much
more
comfortable
for
us
both
if
you
sat
he
obeyed
her
without
a
word
no
wonder
madame
la
vicomtesse
had
had
an
influence
at
court
there
she
said
if
any
reference
i
am
about
to
make
gives
you
pain
i
am
she
paused
briefly
after
ritchie
took
your
mother
from
here
to
new
orleans
some
five
years
ago
she
rented
a
little
house
in
the
rue
bourbon
with
a
screen
of
yellow
and
red
tiles
at
the
edge
of
the
roof
it
is
on
the
south
side
next
to
the
corner
of
the
rue
philippe
there
she
lives
absolutely
alone
except
for
a
servant
clark
who
has
charge
of
her
affairs
was
the
only
person
she
allowed
to
visit
her
for
her
pride
however
misplaced
and
for
her
spirit
we
must
all
admire
her
the
friend
who
discovered
where
she
was
who
went
to
her
and
implored
temple
to
let
her
stay
she
the
friend
he
repeated
in
a
low
tone
i
scarcely
dared
to
glance
at
the
vicomtesse
yes
it
was
antoinette
she
answered
he
did
not
reply
but
his
eyes
fell
antoinette
went
to
her
would
have
comforted
her
would
have
cared
for
her
but
your
mother
sent
her
away
for
five
years
she
has
lived
there
temple
alone
with
her
past
alone
with
her
sorrow
and
remorse
you
must
draw
the
picture
for
yourself
if
the
world
has
a
more
terrible
punishment
i
have
not
heard
of
it
and
when
some
months
ago
i
came
and
antoinette
sent
me
to
her
sent
you
to
her
he
said
raising
his
head
quickly
under
another
name
than
my
own
hélène
continued
apparently
taking
no
notice
of
his
interruption
she
leaned
toward
him
and
her
voice
faltered
i
found
your
mother
he
said
nothing
but
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
slowly
to
the
door
where
he
stood
looking
out
again
i
felt
for
him
i
would
have
gone
to
him
then
had
it
not
been
for
the
sense
in
me
that
hélène
did
not
wish
it
as
for
hélène
she
sat
waiting
for
him
to
turn
back
to
her
and
at
length
he
did
yes
he
said
it
is
her
heart
temple
that
we
fear
the
most
last
night
i
thought
the
end
had
come
it
can
not
be
very
far
away
now
sorrow
and
remorse
have
killed
her
monsieur
the
one
thing
that
she
has
prayed
for
through
the
long
nights
is
that
she
might
see
you
once
again
and
obtain
your
forgiveness
god
himself
does
not
withhold
forgiveness
temple
said
the
vicomtesse
gently
shall
any
of
us
presume
to
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
and
then
his
expression
hardened
i
might
have
been
a
useful
man
he
said
she
ruined
my
life
and
you
will
allow
her
to
ruin
the
rest
of
it
asked
the
vicomtesse
he
stared
at
her
if
you
do
not
go
to
her
and
forgive
her
you
will
remember
it
until
you
die
she
said
he
sank
down
on
the
chair
opposite
to
her
his
head
bowed
into
his
hands
his
elbows
on
the
table
among
the
cards
at
length
i
went
and
laid
my
hands
upon
his
shoulder
and
at
my
touch
he
started
then
he
did
a
singular
thing
an
impulsive
thing
characteristic
of
the
old
nick
i
had
known
he
reached
across
the
table
and
seized
the
hand
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
she
did
not
resist
and
her
smile
i
shall
always
remember
it
was
the
smile
of
a
woman
who
has
suffered
and
understands
i
will
go
to
her
madame
he
said
springing
to
his
feet
i
will
go
to
her
i
i
was
she
rose
too
he
still
clinging
to
her
hand
she
still
unresisting
his
eye
fell
upon
me
where
is
my
hat
davy
he
asked
the
vicomtesse
withdrew
her
hand
and
looked
at
me
alas
it
is
not
quite
so
simple
as
that
temple
she
said
monsieur
de
carondelet
has
first
to
be
reckoned
she
is
dying
you
say
then
i
will
go
to
her
after
that
monsieur
de
carondelet
may
throw
me
into
prison
may
hang
me
may
do
anything
he
chooses
but
i
will
go
to
i
glanced
anxiously
at
the
vicomtesse
well
knowing
how
wilful
he
was
when
aroused
admiration
was
in
her
eyes
seeing
that
he
was
heedless
of
his
own
danger
you
would
not
get
through
the
gates
of
the
city
monsieur
le
baron
requires
passports
now
she
said
at
that
he
began
to
pace
the
little
room
his
hands
clenched
i
could
use
your
passport
davy
he
cried
let
me
have
pardon
me
temple
i
do
not
think
you
could
said
the
vicomtesse
i
flushed
i
suppose
the
remark
was
not
to
be
resisted
then
i
will
go
he
said
with
determination
it
will
be
no
trouble
to
steal
into
the
city
you
say
the
house
has
yellow
and
red
tiles
and
is
near
the
rue
philippe
hélène
laid
her
fingers
on
his
arm
listen
monsieur
there
is
a
better
way
she
said
monsieur
le
baron
is
doubtless
very
angry
with
you
and
i
am
sure
that
this
is
chiefly
because
he
does
not
know
you
for
instance
if
some
one
were
to
tell
him
that
you
are
a
straightforward
courageous
young
man
a
gentleman
with
an
unquenchable
taste
for
danger
that
you
are
not
a
adventurer
and
intriguer
that
you
have
nothing
in
particular
against
his
government
he
might
not
be
quite
so
angry
pardon
me
if
i
say
that
he
is
not
disposed
to
take
your
expedition
any
more
seriously
than
is
your
own
federal
government
the
little
baron
is
irascible
choleric
stern
or
else
and
charitable
just
as
one
happens
to
take
him
as
we
say
in
france
it
is
not
well
to
strike
flint
and
steel
in
his
presence
he
might
blow
up
and
destroy
one
suppose
some
one
were
to
go
to
monsieur
de
carondelet
and
tell
him
what
a
really
estimable
person
you
are
and
assure
him
that
you
will
go
quietly
out
of
his
province
at
the
first
opportunity
and
be
good
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
forever
after
mark
me
i
merely
say
suppose
i
do
not
know
how
far
things
have
gone
or
what
he
may
have
heard
but
suppose
a
person
whom
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
likes
and
trusts
and
respects
a
person
who
understands
his
vagaries
should
go
to
him
on
such
an
and
where
is
such
a
person
to
be
found
said
nick
amused
in
spite
of
himself
madame
la
vicomtesse
courtesied
monsieur
she
is
before
you
she
said
egad
he
cried
do
you
mean
to
say
madame
that
you
will
go
to
the
baron
on
my
behalf
as
soon
as
i
ever
get
to
town
she
said
he
will
have
to
be
waked
from
his
siesta
and
he
does
not
like
but
he
will
forgive
you
said
nick
quick
as
a
flash
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
will
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
faith
cried
nick
he
would
not
be
flesh
and
blood
if
he
didn
at
that
the
vicomtesse
laughed
and
her
eye
rested
judicially
on
me
i
was
standing
rather
glumly
i
fear
in
the
corner
are
you
going
to
take
him
with
you
said
nick
i
was
thinking
of
it
said
the
vicomtesse
mr
ritchie
knows
you
and
he
is
such
a
reliable
and
reputable
nick
bowed
you
should
have
seen
him
marching
in
a
jacobin
procession
madame
he
said
he
follows
his
friends
into
strange
places
she
retorted
and
now
temple
she
added
may
we
trust
you
to
stay
here
with
lamarque
until
you
have
word
from
us
you
know
i
can
not
stay
here
he
cried
and
why
not
monsieur
if
i
were
captured
here
i
should
get
monsieur
de
gré
into
trouble
and
besides
he
said
with
a
touch
of
coldness
i
can
not
be
beholden
to
monsieur
de
gré
i
can
not
remain
on
his
as
for
getting
monsieur
de
gré
into
trouble
his
own
son
could
not
involve
him
with
the
baron
answered
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
it
seems
to
me
monsieur
that
you
are
already
so
far
beholden
to
monsieur
de
gré
that
you
can
not
quibble
about
going
a
little
more
into
his
debt
come
temple
how
has
monsieur
de
gré
ever
offended
you
madame
he
began
monsieur
she
said
with
an
air
not
to
be
denied
i
believe
i
can
discern
a
point
of
honor
as
well
as
you
i
fail
to
see
that
you
have
a
he
was
indeed
no
match
for
her
he
turned
to
me
appealingly
his
brows
bent
but
i
had
no
mind
to
meddle
he
swung
back
to
her
but
madame
he
cried
she
was
arranging
the
cards
neatly
on
the
table
monsieur
you
are
tiresome
she
said
what
is
it
now
he
took
a
step
toward
her
speaking
in
a
low
tone
his
voice
shaking
but
true
to
himself
he
spoke
plainly
as
for
me
i
looked
on
frightened
as
though
watching
a
contest
almost
agape
to
see
what
a
clever
woman
could
do
there
is
mademoiselle
de
gré
yes
there
is
mademoiselle
de
gré
repeated
the
vicomtesse
toying
with
the
cards
his
face
lighted
though
his
lips
twitched
with
pain
she
is
still
she
is
still
mademoiselle
de
gré
monsieur
if
that
is
what
you
and
what
will
she
think
if
i
stay
here
ah
do
you
care
what
she
thinks
temple
said
the
vicomtesse
raising
her
head
quickly
from
what
i
have
heard
i
should
not
have
thought
you
god
help
me
he
answered
simply
i
do
hélène
s
eyes
softened
as
she
looked
at
him
and
my
pride
in
him
was
never
greater
than
at
that
moment
mr
temple
she
said
gently
remain
where
you
are
and
have
faith
in
us
i
begin
to
see
now
why
you
are
so
fortunate
in
your
her
glance
rested
for
a
brief
instant
on
me
mr
ritchie
and
i
will
go
to
new
orleans
talk
to
the
baron
and
send
andré
at
once
with
a
message
if
it
is
in
our
power
you
shall
see
your
mother
very
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
he
bent
and
kissed
it
reverently
with
an
ease
i
envied
he
followed
us
to
the
door
and
when
the
vicomtesse
had
gone
a
little
way
down
the
path
she
looked
at
him
over
her
shoulder
do
not
despair
temple
she
said
it
was
an
answer
to
a
yearning
in
his
face
he
gripped
me
by
the
shoulders
god
bless
you
davy
he
whispered
and
added
god
bless
you
i
overtook
her
where
the
path
ran
into
the
forest
s
shade
and
for
a
long
while
i
walked
after
her
not
breaking
her
silence
my
eyes
upon
her
a
strange
throbbing
in
my
forehead
which
i
did
not
heed
at
last
when
the
perfumes
of
the
flowers
told
us
we
were
nearing
the
garden
she
turned
to
me
i
like
temple
she
said
again
he
is
an
honest
gentleman
i
answered
one
meets
very
few
of
them
she
said
speaking
in
a
low
voice
you
and
i
will
go
to
the
governor
and
after
that
have
you
any
idea
where
you
will
go
no
i
replied
troubled
by
her
regard
then
i
will
tell
you
i
intend
to
send
you
to
madame
gravois
s
and
she
will
compel
you
to
go
to
bed
and
rest
i
do
not
mean
to
allow
you
to
kill
chapter
ix
monsieur
le
baron
the
sun
beat
down
mercilessly
on
thatch
and
terrace
the
yellow
walls
flung
back
the
quivering
heat
as
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
i
walked
through
the
empty
streets
towards
the
governor
s
house
we
were
followed
by
andré
and
madame
s
maid
the
sleepy
orderly
started
up
from
under
the
archway
at
our
approach
bowed
profoundly
to
madame
looked
askance
at
me
and
declared
with
a
thousand
regrets
that
monsieur
le
baron
was
having
his
siesta
then
you
will
wake
him
said
madame
la
vicomtesse
wake
monsieur
le
baron
bueno
dios
did
madame
understand
what
it
meant
to
wake
his
excellency
his
excellency
would
at
first
be
angry
no
doubt
angry
as
an
andalusian
bull
madame
once
when
his
excellency
had
first
come
to
the
province
he
the
orderly
had
presumed
to
awake
him
assez
said
madame
so
suddenly
that
the
man
straightened
and
looked
at
her
again
you
will
wake
monsieur
le
baron
and
tell
him
that
madame
la
vicomtesse
d
has
something
of
importance
to
say
to
madame
had
the
air
and
a
title
carried
with
a
spanish
soldier
in
new
orleans
in
those
days
the
orderly
fairly
swept
the
ground
and
led
us
through
a
court
where
the
sun
drew
bewildering
hot
odors
from
the
fruits
and
flowers
into
a
darkened
room
which
was
the
baron
s
cabinet
i
remember
it
vaguely
for
my
head
was
hot
and
throbbing
from
my
exertions
in
such
a
climate
it
was
a
new
room
the
hotel
being
newly
built
with
white
walls
a
picture
of
his
catholic
majesty
and
the
royal
arms
of
spain
a
map
of
louisiana
another
of
new
orleans
fortified
some
walnut
chairs
a
desk
with
ink
and
sand
and
a
seal
and
a
window
the
closed
lattice
shutters
of
which
showed
streaks
of
light
green
light
these
doubtless
opened
on
the
royal
road
and
looked
across
the
levee
esplanade
on
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
madame
la
vicomtesse
seated
herself
and
with
a
gesture
which
was
an
order
bade
me
do
likewise
he
will
be
angry
the
dear
baron
she
said
he
is
harassed
to
death
with
republics
no
offence
ritchie
he
is
up
at
dawn
looking
to
the
forts
and
palisades
to
guard
against
such
foolish
enterprises
as
this
of
temple
s
and
to
be
waked
out
of
a
siesta
to
save
a
gentleman
who
has
come
here
to
make
things
unpleasant
for
him
is
carrying
a
joke
a
little
far
mais
que
she
gave
a
little
shrug
to
her
slim
shoulders
as
she
smiled
at
me
and
she
seemed
not
a
whit
disturbed
concerning
the
conversation
with
his
excellency
i
wondered
whether
this
were
birth
or
training
or
both
or
a
natural
ability
to
cope
with
affairs
the
women
of
her
order
had
long
been
used
to
intercede
with
sovereigns
to
play
a
part
in
matters
of
state
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
she
was
looking
at
me
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
demanded
and
continued
without
waiting
for
a
reply
you
strange
i
was
thinking
how
odd
it
was
i
replied
that
i
should
have
known
you
all
these
years
by
a
portrait
that
we
should
finally
be
thrown
together
and
that
you
should
be
so
exactly
like
the
person
i
had
supposed
you
to
she
lowered
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
seem
to
take
offence
i
meant
none
and
you
she
answered
are
continually
reminding
me
of
an
englishman
i
knew
when
i
was
a
girl
he
was
a
very
queer
person
to
be
attached
to
the
embassy
not
a
courtier
but
a
serious
literal
person
like
you
ritchie
and
he
resembled
you
very
much
i
was
very
fond
of
and
what
became
of
him
i
asked
other
questions
rose
to
my
lips
but
i
put
them
down
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
bending
forward
a
little
he
did
something
which
i
believe
you
might
have
done
a
certain
marquis
spoke
lightly
of
a
lady
an
englishwoman
at
our
court
and
my
englishman
ran
him
through
one
morning
at
she
paused
and
i
saw
that
her
breath
was
coming
more
quickly
at
the
remembrance
and
then
he
fled
to
england
he
was
a
younger
son
and
poor
but
his
king
heard
of
the
affair
had
it
investigated
and
restored
him
to
the
service
i
have
never
seen
him
since
she
said
but
i
have
often
thought
of
him
there
she
added
after
a
silence
with
a
lightness
which
seemed
assumed
i
have
given
you
a
romance
how
long
the
baron
takes
to
dress
at
that
moment
there
were
footsteps
in
the
and
the
orderly
appeared
at
the
door
saluting
and
speaking
in
spanish
his
excellency
the
governor
we
rose
and
madame
was
courtesying
and
i
was
bowing
to
the
little
man
he
was
in
uniform
his
face
perspiring
in
the
creases
his
plump
calves
stretching
his
white
stockings
to
the
full
madame
extended
her
hand
and
he
kissed
it
albeit
he
did
not
bend
easily
he
spoke
in
french
and
his
voice
betrayed
the
fact
that
his
temper
was
near
slipping
its
leash
the
baron
was
a
native
of
flanders
to
what
happy
circumstance
do
i
owe
the
honor
of
this
visit
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
asked
to
a
woman
s
whim
monsieur
le
baron
she
answered
for
a
man
would
not
have
dared
to
disturb
you
may
i
present
to
your
excellency
david
ritchie
of
kentucky
his
excellency
bowed
stiffly
looked
at
me
with
no
pretence
of
pleasure
and
i
had
had
sufficient
dealings
with
men
to
divine
that
in
the
coming
conversation
the
overflow
of
his
temper
would
be
poured
upon
me
his
first
sensation
was
surprise
an
american
he
said
in
a
tone
that
implied
reproach
to
madame
la
vicomtesse
for
having
fallen
into
such
company
ah
he
cried
breathing
hard
in
the
manner
of
stout
people
i
remember
you
came
down
with
monsieur
vigo
monsieur
did
you
not
it
was
my
turn
to
be
surprised
if
the
baron
took
a
like
cognizance
of
all
my
countrymen
who
came
to
new
orleans
he
was
a
busy
man
indeed
yes
your
excellency
i
answered
and
you
are
a
federalist
he
said
though
petulantly
i
am
your
is
your
nation
to
overrun
the
earth
said
the
baron
every
morning
when
i
ride
through
the
streets
it
seems
to
me
that
more
americans
have
come
pardieu
i
declare
every
day
that
if
it
were
not
for
the
americans
i
should
have
ten
years
more
of
life
ahead
of
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
glance
at
madame
la
vicomtesse
her
eyes
half
closed
betrayed
an
amusement
that
was
scarce
repressed
come
monsieur
le
baron
she
said
you
and
i
have
like
beliefs
upon
most
matters
we
have
both
suffered
at
the
hands
of
people
who
have
mistaken
a
fiend
for
a
you
would
have
me
believe
madame
the
baron
put
in
with
a
wit
i
had
not
thought
in
him
that
ritchie
knows
a
lady
when
he
sees
one
i
can
readily
believe
madame
laughed
he
at
least
has
a
negative
knowledge
she
replied
and
he
has
brought
into
new
orleans
no
coins
boxes
or
clocks
against
your
excellency
s
orders
with
the
image
and
superscription
of
the
goddess
in
whose
name
all
things
are
done
he
has
not
sung
ça
ira
at
the
theatres
and
he
detests
the
tricolored
cockades
as
much
as
you
the
baron
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
and
began
to
thaw
there
was
a
little
more
friendliness
in
his
next
glance
at
me
what
images
have
you
brought
in
ritchie
he
asked
we
all
worship
the
sex
in
some
form
however
misplaced
our
notions
of
there
is
not
the
least
doubt
that
for
the
sake
of
the
vicomtesse
he
was
trying
to
be
genial
and
that
his
remark
was
a
purely
random
one
but
the
roots
of
my
hair
seemed
to
have
taken
fire
i
saw
the
baron
as
in
a
glass
darkly
but
i
kept
my
head
principally
because
the
situation
had
elements
of
danger
the
image
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
monsieur
i
said
dame
exclaimed
his
excellency
eying
me
with
a
new
interest
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
being
a
no
more
he
is
monsieur
le
baron
said
the
vicomtesse
for
he
speaks
the
his
excellency
looked
blank
as
for
me
i
held
my
breath
wondering
what
coup
madame
was
meditating
mr
ritchie
brought
down
from
kentucky
a
miniature
of
me
by
boze
that
was
painted
in
a
costume
i
once
wore
at
comment
diable
exclaimed
the
baron
and
how
did
such
a
thing
get
into
kentucky
madame
you
have
brought
me
to
the
point
she
replied
which
is
no
small
triumph
for
your
excellency
ritchie
bought
the
miniature
from
that
most
estimable
of
my
relations
monsieur
auguste
de
the
baron
sat
down
and
began
to
fan
himself
he
even
grew
a
little
purple
he
looked
at
madame
sputtered
and
i
began
to
think
that
if
he
didn
t
relieve
himself
his
head
might
blow
off
as
for
the
vicomtesse
she
wore
an
ingenuous
air
of
detachment
and
seemed
supremely
unconscious
of
the
volcano
by
her
side
so
madame
cried
the
governor
at
length
after
i
know
not
what
repressions
you
have
come
here
in
behalf
of
that
of
auguste
de
gré
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
monsieur
answered
the
vicomtesse
calmly
you
may
hang
auguste
put
him
in
prison
drown
him
or
do
anything
you
like
with
god
help
me
said
the
poor
man
searching
for
his
handkerchief
and
utterly
confounded
why
is
it
you
have
come
to
me
then
why
did
you
wake
me
up
he
added
so
far
forgetting
himself
i
came
in
behalf
of
the
gentleman
who
had
the
indiscretion
to
accompany
auguste
to
louisiana
she
continued
in
behalf
of
nicholas
temple
who
is
a
cousin
of
the
baron
started
abruptly
from
his
chair
i
have
heard
of
him
he
cried
madame
knows
where
he
is
i
know
where
he
is
it
is
that
which
i
came
to
tell
your
hein
said
his
excellency
again
nonplussed
you
came
to
tell
me
where
he
is
and
where
the
the
other
one
is
parfaitement
said
madame
but
before
i
tell
you
where
they
are
i
wish
to
tell
you
something
about
madame
i
know
something
of
him
already
said
the
baron
impatiently
ah
said
she
from
gignoux
and
what
do
you
hear
from
gignoux
this
was
another
shock
under
which
the
baron
fairly
staggered
diable
is
madame
la
vicomtesse
in
the
plot
he
cried
what
does
madame
know
of
gignoux
madame
s
manner
suddenly
froze
i
am
likely
to
be
in
the
plot
monsieur
she
said
i
am
likely
to
be
in
a
plot
which
has
for
its
furtherance
that
abominable
anarchy
which
deprived
me
of
my
home
and
estates
of
my
relatives
and
friends
and
my
a
thousand
pardons
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
the
baron
more
at
sea
than
ever
i
have
had
much
to
do
these
last
years
and
the
heat
and
the
republicans
have
got
on
my
temper
will
madame
la
vicomtesse
pray
explain
i
was
about
to
do
so
when
your
excellency
interrupted
said
madame
you
see
before
you
ritchie
barrister
of
louisville
kentucky
whose
character
of
sobriety
dependence
and
ability
there
was
a
little
gleam
in
her
eye
as
she
gave
me
this
array
of
virtues
can
be
perfectly
established
when
he
came
to
new
orleans
some
years
ago
he
brought
letters
to
monsieur
de
gré
from
monsieur
gratiot
and
colonel
chouteau
of
louis
and
he
is
known
to
clark
and
to
monsieur
vigo
he
is
a
federalist
as
you
know
and
has
no
sympathy
with
the
eh
bien
ritchie
said
the
baron
getting
his
breath
you
are
fortunate
in
your
advocate
madame
la
vicomtesse
neglected
to
say
that
she
was
your
friend
the
greatest
of
all
recommendations
in
my
you
are
delightful
monsieur
le
baron
said
the
vicomtesse
perhaps
ritchie
can
tell
me
something
of
this
expedition
said
the
baron
his
eyes
growing
smaller
as
he
looked
at
me
willingly
i
answered
although
i
know
that
your
excellency
is
well
informed
and
that
monsieur
vigo
has
doubtless
given
you
many
of
the
details
that
i
he
interrupted
me
with
a
grunt
you
americans
are
clever
people
monsieur
he
said
you
contrive
to
combine
shrewdness
with
if
i
had
anything
to
hide
from
your
excellency
i
should
not
be
here
i
answered
the
expedition
as
you
know
has
been
as
much
of
a
farce
as
citizen
genêt
s
commissions
but
it
has
been
a
sad
farce
to
me
inasmuch
as
it
involves
the
honor
of
my
old
friend
and
colonel
general
clark
and
the
safety
of
my
cousin
so
you
were
with
clark
in
illinois
said
the
baron
craftily
pardon
me
ritchie
but
i
should
have
said
that
you
are
too
monsieur
vigo
will
tell
you
that
i
was
the
drummer
boy
of
the
regiment
and
a
sort
of
ward
of
the
colonel
s
i
used
to
clean
his
guns
and
cook
his
and
you
did
not
see
fit
to
follow
your
colonel
to
louisiana
said
his
excellency
for
he
had
been
trained
in
a
service
of
suspicion
general
clark
is
not
what
he
was
i
replied
chafing
a
little
at
his
manner
your
excellency
knows
that
and
i
put
loyalty
to
my
government
before
friendship
and
i
might
remind
your
excellency
that
i
am
neither
an
adventurer
nor
a
the
little
baron
surprised
me
by
laughing
his
irritability
and
his
good
nature
ran
in
streaks
there
is
no
occasion
to
ritchie
he
answered
i
have
seen
something
of
men
in
my
time
in
which
category
do
you
place
your
cousin
temple
if
a
love
of
travel
and
excitement
and
danger
constitutes
an
adventurer
temple
is
such
i
said
fortunately
the
main
spur
of
the
adventurer
s
character
is
lacking
in
his
case
i
refer
to
the
desire
for
money
temple
has
an
annuity
from
his
father
s
estate
in
charleston
which
puts
him
beyond
the
pale
of
the
and
i
firmly
believe
that
if
your
excellency
sees
fit
to
allow
him
to
leave
the
province
and
if
certain
disquieting
elements
can
be
removed
from
his
life
i
glanced
at
the
vicomtesse
he
will
settle
down
and
become
a
useful
citizen
of
the
united
states
as
much
as
i
dislike
to
submit
to
a
stranger
private
details
in
the
life
of
a
member
of
my
family
i
feel
that
i
must
tell
your
excellency
something
of
temple
s
career
in
order
that
you
may
know
that
restlessness
and
the
thirst
for
adventure
were
the
only
motives
that
led
him
into
this
foolish
pray
proceed
ritchie
said
the
baron
i
was
surprised
not
to
find
him
more
restless
and
in
addition
the
glance
of
approbation
which
the
vicomtesse
gave
me
spurred
me
on
however
distasteful
i
had
the
sense
to
see
that
i
must
hold
nothing
back
of
which
his
excellency
might
at
any
time
become
cognizant
and
therefore
i
told
him
as
briefly
as
possible
nick
s
story
leaving
out
only
the
episode
with
antoinette
when
i
came
to
the
relation
of
the
affairs
which
occurred
at
les
îles
five
years
before
and
told
his
excellency
that
temple
had
since
been
living
in
the
rue
bourbon
as
clive
unknown
to
her
son
the
baron
broke
in
upon
me
so
the
mystery
of
that
woman
is
cleared
at
last
he
said
and
turned
to
the
vicomtesse
i
have
learned
that
you
have
been
a
frequent
visitor
not
a
sparrow
falls
to
the
ground
in
louisiana
that
your
excellency
does
not
hear
of
it
she
answered
and
gignoux
he
said
speaking
to
me
again
as
i
told
you
monsieur
le
baron
i
answered
i
have
come
to
new
orleans
at
a
personal
sacrifice
to
induce
my
cousin
to
abandon
this
matter
and
i
went
out
last
evening
to
try
to
get
word
of
this
was
not
strictly
true
i
saw
monsieur
gignoux
in
conference
with
some
of
your
officers
who
came
out
of
this
you
have
sharp
eyes
monsieur
he
remarked
i
suspected
the
man
when
i
met
him
in
kentucky
i
continued
not
heeding
this
monsieur
vigo
himself
distrusted
him
to
say
that
gignoux
were
deep
in
the
councils
of
the
expedition
that
he
held
a
commission
from
citizen
genêt
i
realize
will
have
no
weight
with
your
excellency
provided
the
man
is
in
the
secret
service
of
his
majesty
the
king
of
mr
ritchie
said
the
baron
you
are
a
young
man
and
i
an
old
one
if
i
tell
you
that
i
have
a
great
respect
for
your
astuteness
and
ability
do
not
put
it
down
to
flattery
i
wish
that
your
countrymen
who
are
coming
down
the
river
like
driftwood
more
resembled
you
as
for
citizen
gignoux
he
went
on
smiling
and
wiping
his
face
let
not
your
heart
be
troubled
his
majesty
s
minister
at
philadelphia
has
written
me
letters
on
the
subject
i
am
contemplating
for
monsieur
gignoux
a
sea
voyage
to
havana
and
he
is
at
present
partaking
of
my
hospitality
in
the
in
the
calabozo
i
cried
overwhelmed
at
this
example
of
spanish
justice
and
omniscience
precisely
said
the
baron
drumming
with
his
fingers
on
his
fat
knee
and
now
he
added
perhaps
madame
la
vicomtesse
is
ready
to
tell
me
of
the
whereabouts
of
temple
and
her
estimable
cousin
auguste
it
may
interest
her
to
know
why
i
have
allowed
them
their
liberty
so
a
point
on
which
i
have
been
consumed
with
curiosity
since
i
have
begun
to
tremble
at
the
amazing
thoroughness
of
your
excellency
s
system
said
the
vicomtesse
his
excellency
scarcely
looked
the
tyrant
as
he
sat
before
us
with
his
calves
crossed
and
his
hands
folded
on
his
waistcoat
and
his
little
black
eyes
twinkling
it
is
because
he
said
there
are
many
french
planters
in
the
province
bitten
with
the
three
horrors
he
meant
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
i
sent
six
to
havana
and
if
monsieur
étienne
de
boré
had
not
in
the
nick
of
time
for
him
discovered
how
to
make
sugar
he
would
have
gone
too
i
had
an
idea
that
the
sieur
de
gré
and
temple
might
act
as
a
bait
to
reveal
the
disease
in
some
others
ha
i
am
cleverer
than
you
thought
ritchie
you
are
surprised
i
was
surprised
and
showed
it
come
he
said
you
are
astute
why
did
you
think
i
left
them
at
liberty
i
thought
your
excellency
believed
them
to
be
harmless
as
they
are
i
replied
he
turned
again
to
the
vicomtesse
you
have
picked
up
a
diplomat
madame
i
must
confess
that
i
misjudged
him
when
you
introduced
him
to
me
and
again
where
are
temple
and
your
estimable
cousin
shall
i
tell
you
they
are
at
old
lamarque
s
on
the
plantation
of
philippe
de
they
were
your
excellency
said
the
vicomtesse
eh
exclaimed
the
baron
jumping
mademoiselle
de
gré
has
given
her
brother
eight
hundred
livres
and
he
is
probably
by
this
time
on
board
a
french
ship
at
the
english
turn
he
is
very
badly
frightened
i
will
give
your
excellency
one
more
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
the
baron
i
have
heard
that
but
for
your
coolness
and
adroitness
monsieur
le
vicomte
your
husband
and
several
other
noblemen
and
their
ladies
and
some
of
her
majesty
s
letters
and
jewels
would
never
have
gotten
out
of
france
i
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
that
i
have
the
greatest
respect
for
your
intelligence
now
what
is
the
surprise
that
your
excellency
intended
that
both
temple
and
auguste
de
gré
were
to
escape
on
that
mille
tonneres
exclaimed
the
baron
staring
at
her
and
straightway
he
fell
into
a
fit
of
laughter
that
left
him
coughing
and
choking
and
perspiring
as
only
a
man
in
his
condition
of
flesh
can
perspire
to
say
that
i
was
bewildered
by
this
last
evidence
of
the
insight
of
the
woman
beside
me
would
be
to
put
it
mildly
the
vicomtesse
sat
quietly
watching
him
the
wonted
look
of
repressed
laughter
on
her
face
and
by
degrees
his
excellency
grew
calm
again
mon
dieu
said
he
i
always
like
to
cross
swords
with
you
madame
la
vicomtesse
yet
this
encounter
has
been
more
pleasurable
than
any
i
have
had
since
i
came
to
louisiana
but
diable
he
cried
just
as
i
was
congratulating
myself
that
i
was
to
have
one
american
the
less
you
come
and
tell
me
that
he
has
refused
to
flee
out
of
consideration
for
the
character
and
services
of
monsieur
philippe
de
gré
i
was
willing
to
let
them
both
escape
but
now
mr
temple
is
not
known
in
new
orleans
except
to
the
gré
family
said
the
vicomtesse
he
is
a
man
of
honor
suppose
ritchie
were
to
bring
him
to
your
excellency
and
he
were
to
give
you
his
word
that
he
would
leave
the
province
at
the
first
opportunity
he
now
wishes
to
see
his
mother
before
she
dies
and
it
was
as
much
as
we
could
do
this
morning
to
persuade
him
from
going
to
her
openly
in
the
face
of
but
the
baron
was
old
in
a
service
which
did
not
do
things
hastily
he
is
well
enough
where
he
is
for
said
his
excellency
resuming
his
official
manner
after
dark
i
will
send
down
an
officer
and
have
him
brought
before
me
he
will
not
then
be
seen
in
custody
by
any
one
and
provided
i
am
satisfied
with
him
he
may
go
to
the
rue
the
little
baron
rose
and
bowed
to
the
vicomtesse
to
signify
that
the
audience
was
ended
and
he
added
as
he
kissed
her
hand
madame
la
vicomtesse
it
is
a
pleasure
to
be
able
to
serve
such
a
woman
as
chapter
x
the
scourge
as
we
went
through
the
court
i
felt
as
though
i
had
been
tied
to
a
string
suspended
in
the
air
and
spun
this
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
heat
and
after
the
astonishing
conversation
from
which
we
had
come
my
admiration
for
the
lady
beside
me
was
magnified
to
a
veritable
awe
we
reached
the
archway
madame
la
vicomtesse
held
me
lightly
by
the
edge
of
my
coat
and
i
stood
looking
down
at
her
wait
a
minute
ritchie
she
said
glancing
at
the
few
figures
hurrying
across
the
place
d
armes
those
are
only
americans
and
they
are
too
busy
to
see
us
standing
here
what
do
you
propose
to
do
now
we
must
get
word
to
nick
as
we
promised
that
he
may
know
what
to
expect
i
replied
suppose
we
go
to
monsieur
de
gré
s
house
and
write
him
a
letter
no
said
the
vicomtesse
with
decision
i
am
going
to
temple
s
i
shall
write
the
letter
from
there
and
send
it
by
andré
and
you
will
go
direct
to
madame
gravois
her
glance
rested
anxiously
upon
my
face
and
there
came
an
expression
in
her
eyes
which
disturbed
me
strangely
i
had
not
known
it
since
the
days
when
polly
ann
used
to
mother
me
but
i
did
not
mean
to
give
up
i
am
not
tired
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
answered
and
i
will
go
with
you
to
temple
give
me
your
hand
she
said
and
smiled
andré
and
my
maid
are
used
to
my
vagaries
and
your
own
countrymen
will
not
mind
give
me
your
hand
i
gave
it
willingly
enough
with
a
thrill
as
she
took
it
between
her
own
the
same
anxious
look
was
in
her
eyes
and
not
the
least
embarrassment
there
it
is
hot
and
dry
as
i
feared
she
said
and
you
seem
she
dropped
my
hand
and
there
was
a
touch
of
irritation
in
her
voice
as
she
continued
you
seemed
fairly
sensible
when
i
first
met
you
last
night
ritchie
are
you
losing
your
sanity
do
you
not
realize
that
you
can
not
take
liberties
with
this
climate
do
as
i
say
and
go
to
madame
gravois
s
at
it
is
my
pleasure
to
obey
you
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
answered
but
i
mean
to
go
with
you
as
far
as
temple
s
to
see
how
she
fares
she
may
be
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
kill
yourself
said
madame
coldly
will
you
not
do
as
i
say
i
think
that
i
should
go
to
temple
s
i
answered
she
did
not
reply
to
that
letting
down
her
veil
impatiently
with
a
deftness
that
characterized
all
her
movements
without
so
much
as
asking
me
to
come
after
her
she
reached
the
banquette
and
i
walked
by
her
side
through
the
streets
silent
and
troubled
by
her
displeasure
my
pride
forbade
me
to
do
as
she
wished
it
was
the
hottest
part
of
a
burning
day
and
the
dome
of
the
sky
was
like
a
brazen
bell
above
us
we
passed
the
the
calabozo
with
its
iron
gates
and
tiny
grilled
windows
pierced
in
the
massive
walls
behind
which
gignoux
languished
and
i
could
not
repress
a
smile
as
i
thought
of
him
even
the
spaniards
sometimes
happened
upon
justice
in
the
rue
bourbon
the
little
shops
were
empty
the
doorstep
where
my
merry
fiddler
had
played
vacant
and
the
very
air
seemed
to
simmer
above
the
honeycombed
tiles
i
knocked
at
the
door
once
twice
there
was
no
answer
i
looked
at
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
knocked
again
so
loudly
that
the
little
tailor
across
the
street
his
shirt
opened
at
the
neck
flung
out
his
shutter
suddenly
there
was
a
noise
within
the
door
was
opened
and
lindy
stood
before
us
in
the
darkened
room
with
terror
in
her
eyes
oh
marse
dave
she
cried
as
we
entered
oh
madame
i
se
so
glad
you
se
come
i
se
so
glad
you
se
she
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
raising
her
veil
seized
the
girl
by
the
arm
what
is
it
she
said
what
is
the
matter
lindy
madame
s
touch
seemed
to
steady
her
miss
sally
she
moaned
miss
sally
done
got
de
yaller
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
for
we
were
both
too
appalled
by
the
news
to
speak
lindy
are
you
sure
said
the
vicomtesse
yass
m
yass
m
lindy
sobbed
i
reckon
i
se
done
seed
nuf
of
it
and
she
went
into
a
hysterical
fit
of
weeping
the
vicomtesse
turned
to
her
own
frightened
servants
in
the
doorway
bade
andré
in
french
to
run
for
perrin
and
herself
closed
the
battened
doors
there
was
a
moment
when
her
face
as
i
saw
it
was
graven
on
my
memory
reflecting
a
knowledge
of
the
evils
of
this
world
a
spirit
above
and
untouched
by
them
a
power
to
accept
what
life
may
bring
with
no
outward
sign
of
pleasure
or
dismay
doubtless
thus
she
had
made
king
and
cardinal
laugh
doubtless
thus
ministering
to
those
who
crossed
her
path
she
had
met
her
own
calamities
strangest
of
all
was
the
effect
she
had
upon
lindy
for
the
girl
ceased
crying
as
she
watched
her
madame
la
vicomtesse
turned
to
me
you
must
go
at
once
she
said
when
you
get
to
madame
gravois
s
write
to
temple
i
will
send
andré
to
you
she
started
for
the
bedroom
door
lindy
making
way
for
her
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
did
as
i
sprang
forward
and
took
the
vicomtesse
by
the
arm
where
are
you
going
i
cried
you
can
not
go
in
there
you
can
not
go
in
there
it
did
not
seem
strange
that
she
turned
to
me
without
anger
that
she
did
not
seek
to
release
her
arm
it
did
not
seem
strange
that
her
look
had
in
it
a
gentleness
as
she
spoke
i
must
she
said
i
can
not
let
you
risk
your
life
i
cried
wholly
forgetting
myself
there
are
others
who
will
do
others
she
said
i
will
go
i
i
have
nursed
people
before
this
and
there
is
a
smile
quivered
on
her
lips
or
was
it
a
smile
you
will
do
as
i
say
and
go
to
madame
gravois
s
at
once
she
murmured
striving
for
the
first
time
to
free
herself
if
you
stay
i
stay
i
answered
and
if
you
die
i
she
looked
up
into
my
eyes
for
a
fleeting
instant
write
to
temple
she
said
dazed
i
watched
her
open
the
bedroom
doors
motion
to
lindy
to
pass
through
and
then
she
had
closed
them
again
and
i
was
alone
in
the
darkened
parlor
the
throbbing
in
my
head
was
gone
and
a
great
clearness
had
come
with
a
great
fear
i
stood
i
know
not
how
long
listening
to
the
groans
that
came
through
the
wall
for
temple
was
in
agony
at
intervals
i
heard
hélène
s
voice
and
then
the
groans
seemed
to
stop
ten
times
i
went
to
the
bedroom
door
and
as
many
times
drew
away
again
my
heart
leaping
within
me
at
the
peril
which
she
faced
if
i
had
had
the
right
i
believe
i
would
have
carried
her
away
by
force
but
i
had
not
the
right
i
sat
down
heavily
by
the
table
to
think
and
it
might
have
been
a
cry
of
agony
sharper
than
the
rest
that
reminded
me
once
more
of
the
tragedy
of
the
poor
lady
in
torture
my
eye
fell
upon
the
table
and
there
as
though
prepared
for
what
i
was
to
do
lay
pen
and
paper
ink
and
sand
my
hand
shook
as
i
took
the
quill
and
tried
to
compose
a
letter
to
my
cousin
i
scarcely
saw
the
words
which
i
put
on
the
sheet
and
i
may
be
forgiven
for
the
unwisdom
of
that
which
i
wrote
the
baron
de
carondelet
will
send
an
officer
for
you
so
that
you
may
escape
observation
in
custody
his
excellency
knew
of
your
but
is
inclined
to
be
lenient
will
allow
you
to
go
to
the
rue
bourbon
and
will
without
doubt
permit
you
to
leave
the
province
your
mother
is
ill
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
myself
are
with
her
in
the
state
i
was
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
compose
this
much
and
i
had
barely
finished
it
when
there
was
a
knock
at
the
outer
door
there
was
andré
he
had
the
immobility
of
face
which
sometimes
goes
with
the
mulatto
and
always
with
the
trained
servant
as
he
informed
me
that
monsieur
le
médecin
was
not
at
home
but
that
he
had
left
word
there
was
an
epidemic
monsieur
so
andré
feared
i
gave
him
the
note
and
his
directions
and
ten
minutes
after
he
had
gone
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
called
him
back
how
about
antoinette
alone
at
les
îles
why
had
i
not
thought
of
her
we
had
told
her
nothing
that
morning
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
i
after
our
conference
with
nick
for
the
girl
had
shut
herself
in
her
room
and
madame
had
thought
it
best
not
to
disturb
her
at
such
a
stage
but
would
she
not
be
alarmed
when
hélène
failed
to
return
that
night
had
circumstances
been
different
i
myself
would
have
ridden
to
les
îles
but
no
inducement
now
could
make
me
desert
the
post
i
had
chosen
after
many
years
i
dislike
to
recall
to
memory
that
long
afternoon
which
i
spent
helpless
in
the
rue
bourbon
now
i
was
on
my
feet
pacing
restlessly
the
short
breadth
of
the
room
trying
to
shut
out
from
my
mind
the
horrors
of
which
my
ears
gave
testimony
again
in
the
intervals
of
quiet
i
sat
with
my
elbows
on
the
table
and
my
head
in
my
hands
striving
to
allay
the
throbbing
in
my
temples
pains
came
and
went
and
at
times
i
felt
like
a
fagot
flung
into
the
fire
i
who
had
never
known
a
sick
day
at
times
my
throat
pained
me
an
odd
symptom
in
a
warm
climate
troubled
as
i
was
in
mind
and
body
the
thought
of
hélène
s
quiet
heroism
upheld
me
through
it
all
more
than
once
i
had
my
hand
raised
to
knock
at
the
bedroom
door
and
ask
if
i
could
help
but
i
dared
not
at
length
the
sun
having
done
its
worst
and
spent
its
fury
i
began
to
hear
steps
along
the
banquette
and
voices
almost
at
my
elbow
beyond
the
little
window
at
every
noise
i
peered
out
hoping
for
the
doctor
but
he
did
not
come
and
then
as
i
fell
back
into
the
fauteuil
there
was
borne
on
my
consciousness
a
sound
i
had
heard
before
it
was
the
music
of
the
fiddler
it
was
a
tune
i
knew
and
the
voices
of
the
children
were
singing
the
refrain
ne
sait
quand
reviendra
ne
sait
quand
i
rose
opened
the
door
and
slipped
out
of
it
and
i
must
have
made
a
strange
hatless
figure
as
i
came
upon
the
fiddler
and
his
children
from
across
the
street
stop
that
noise
i
cried
in
french
angered
beyond
all
reason
at
the
thought
of
music
at
such
a
time
idiots
there
is
yellow
fever
the
little
man
stopped
with
his
bow
raised
for
a
moment
they
all
stared
at
me
transfixed
it
was
a
little
elf
in
blue
indienne
who
jumped
first
and
ran
down
the
street
crying
the
news
in
a
shrill
voice
the
others
following
the
fiddler
gazing
stupidly
after
them
suddenly
he
scrambled
up
moaning
as
if
the
scourge
itself
had
fastened
on
him
backed
into
the
house
and
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
i
returned
with
slow
steps
to
shut
myself
in
the
darkened
room
again
and
i
recall
feeling
something
of
triumph
over
the
consternation
i
had
caused
no
sounds
came
from
the
bedroom
and
after
that
the
street
was
quiet
as
death
save
for
an
occasional
frightened
hurrying
footfall
i
was
tired
all
at
once
the
bedroom
door
opened
softly
and
hélène
was
standing
there
looking
at
me
at
first
i
saw
her
dimly
as
in
a
vision
then
clearly
i
leaped
to
my
feet
and
went
and
stood
beside
her
the
doctor
has
not
come
i
said
where
does
he
live
i
will
go
for
she
shook
her
head
he
can
do
no
good
lindy
has
procured
all
the
remedies
such
as
they
are
they
can
only
serve
to
alleviate
she
answered
she
can
not
withstand
this
poor
there
were
tears
on
hélène
s
lashes
her
sufferings
have
been
frightful
can
not
i
help
i
said
thickly
can
not
i
do
something
she
shook
her
head
she
raised
her
hand
timidly
to
the
lapel
of
my
coat
and
suddenly
i
felt
her
palm
cool
and
firm
upon
my
forehead
it
rested
there
but
an
instant
you
ought
not
to
be
here
she
said
her
voice
vibrant
with
earnestness
and
concern
you
ought
not
to
be
here
will
you
not
go
if
i
ask
it
i
can
not
i
said
you
know
i
can
not
if
you
she
did
not
answer
that
our
eyes
met
and
in
that
instant
for
me
there
was
neither
joy
nor
sorrow
sickness
nor
death
nor
time
nor
space
nor
universe
it
was
she
who
turned
away
have
you
written
him
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
yes
i
answered
she
would
not
have
known
him
said
hélène
after
all
these
years
of
waiting
she
would
not
have
known
him
her
punishment
has
been
a
sound
came
from
the
bedroom
and
hélène
was
gone
silently
as
she
had
come
i
must
have
been
dozing
in
the
fauteuil
for
suddenly
i
found
myself
sitting
up
listening
to
an
unwonted
noise
i
knew
from
the
count
of
the
which
came
from
down
the
street
that
a
horse
was
galloping
in
long
strides
a
spent
horse
for
the
timing
was
irregular
then
he
was
pulled
up
into
a
trot
then
to
a
walk
as
i
ran
to
the
door
and
opened
it
and
beheld
nicholas
temple
flinging
himself
from
a
pony
white
with
lather
and
he
was
alone
he
caught
sight
of
me
as
soon
as
his
foot
touched
the
banquette
what
are
you
doing
here
i
cried
what
are
you
doing
here
he
halted
on
the
edge
of
the
banquette
as
a
hurrying
man
runs
into
a
wall
he
had
been
all
excitement
all
fury
as
he
jumped
from
his
horse
and
now
as
he
looked
at
me
he
seemed
to
lose
his
bearings
to
be
all
bewilderment
he
cried
out
my
name
and
stood
looking
at
me
like
a
fool
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
coming
here
i
cried
did
i
not
write
you
to
stay
where
you
were
how
did
you
get
here
i
stepped
down
on
the
banquette
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
did
you
receive
my
letter
yes
he
said
for
a
moment
that
was
as
far
as
he
got
and
he
glanced
down
the
street
and
then
at
the
heaving
beast
he
had
ridden
which
stood
with
head
drooping
to
the
kennel
then
he
laid
hold
of
me
davy
is
it
true
that
she
has
yellow
fever
is
it
true
who
told
you
i
demanded
angrily
andré
he
answered
andré
said
that
the
lady
here
had
yellow
fever
is
it
true
yes
i
said
almost
inaudibly
he
let
his
hand
fall
from
my
shoulder
and
he
shivered
may
god
forgive
me
for
what
i
have
done
he
said
where
is
she
for
what
you
have
done
i
cried
you
have
done
an
insensate
thing
to
come
suddenly
i
remembered
the
sentry
at
the
gate
of
fort
charles
how
did
you
get
into
the
city
i
said
were
you
mad
to
defy
the
baron
and
his
police
damn
the
baron
and
his
police
he
answered
striving
to
pass
me
let
me
in
let
me
see
even
as
he
spoke
i
caught
sight
of
men
coming
into
the
street
perhaps
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
pierre
and
then
more
men
and
as
we
went
into
the
house
i
saw
that
they
were
running
i
closed
the
doors
there
were
cries
in
the
street
now
but
he
did
not
seem
to
heed
them
he
stood
listening
to
the
sounds
that
came
through
the
bedroom
wall
and
a
spasm
crossed
his
face
then
he
turned
like
a
man
not
to
be
denied
to
the
bedroom
door
i
was
before
him
but
madame
la
vicomtesse
opened
it
and
i
remember
feeling
astonishment
that
she
did
not
show
surprise
or
alarm
what
are
you
doing
here
temple
she
said
my
mother
madame
my
mother
i
must
go
to
he
pushed
past
her
into
the
bedroom
and
i
followed
perforce
i
shall
never
forget
the
scene
though
i
had
but
the
one
glimpse
of
it
the
raving
yellowed
woman
in
the
bed
not
a
spectre
nor
yet
even
a
semblance
of
the
beauty
of
temple
bow
but
she
was
his
mother
upon
whom
god
had
brought
such
a
retribution
as
he
alone
can
bestow
lindy
faithful
servant
to
the
end
held
the
wasted
hands
of
her
mistress
against
the
violence
they
would
have
done
lindy
held
them
her
own
body
rocking
with
grief
her
lips
murmuring
endearments
prayers
supplications
miss
sally

ter
see
marse
nick
the
words
died
on
lindy
s
lips
the
ravings
of
the
frenzied
woman
ceased
the
yellowed
hands
fell
limply
to
the
sheet
the
shrunken
form
stiffened
the
eyes
of
the
mother
looked
upon
the
son
and
in
them
at
first
was
the
terror
of
one
who
sees
the
infinite
then
they
softened
until
they
became
again
the
only
feature
that
was
left
of
sarah
temple
now
as
she
looked
at
him
who
was
her
pride
her
honor
for
one
sight
of
whom
she
had
prayed
ay
and
even
blasphemed
her
eyes
were
all
tenderness
then
she
spoke

she
said
softly
be
good
to
me
dear
you
are
all
i
have
she
spoke
of
harry
riddle
but
the
long
years
of
penance
had
not
been
in
vain
nick
had
forgiven
her
we
saw
him
kneeling
at
the
bedside
we
saw
him
with
her
hand
in
his
and
hélène
was
drawing
me
gently
out
of
the
room
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
she
did
not
look
at
me
nor
i
at
her
we
stood
for
a
moment
close
together
and
suddenly
the
cries
in
the
street
brought
us
back
from
the
drama
in
the
reeking
room
we
had
left
ici
ici
voici
le
cheval
there
was
a
loud
rapping
at
the
outer
door
and
a
voice
demanding
admittance
in
spanish
in
the
name
of
his
excellency
the
governor
open
it
said
hélène
there
was
neither
excitement
in
her
voice
nor
yet
resignation
in
those
two
words
was
told
the
philosophy
of
her
life
i
opened
the
door
there
on
the
step
was
an
officer
perspiring
uniformed
and
plumed
and
behind
him
a
crowd
of
eager
faces
white
and
black
that
seemed
to
fill
the
street
he
took
a
step
into
the
room
his
hand
on
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
poured
out
at
me
a
torrent
of
spanish
of
which
i
understood
nothing
all
at
once
his
eye
fell
upon
hélène
who
was
standing
behind
me
and
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
his
speech
and
pulled
off
his
hat
and
bowed
profoundly
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
stammered
i
was
no
little
surprised
that
she
should
be
so
well
known
you
will
please
to
speak
french
monsieur
she
said
this
gentleman
does
not
understand
spanish
what
is
it
you
desire
a
thousand
pardons
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
said
i
am
the
alcalde
de
barrio
and
a
wild
americano
has
passed
the
sentry
at
charles
s
gate
without
heeding
his
excellency
s
authority
and
command
i
saw
the
man
with
my
own
eyes
i
should
know
him
again
in
a
hundred
we
have
traced
him
here
to
this
house
madame
la
vicomtesse
behold
the
horse
which
he
rode
the
alcalde
turned
and
pointed
at
the
beast
behold
the
horse
which
he
rode
madame
la
vicomtesse
the
animal
will
probably
answered
the
vicomtesse
in
an
even
tone
but
the
man
cried
the
alcalde
the
man
is
here
madame
la
vicomtesse
here
in
this
house
yes
she
said
he
is
sancta
maria
madame
he
exclaimed
i
i
who
speak
to
you
have
come
to
get
him
he
has
defied
his
excellency
s
commands
where
is
he
he
is
in
that
room
said
the
vicomtesse
pointing
at
the
bedroom
door
the
alcalde
took
a
step
forward
she
stopped
him
by
a
quick
gesture
he
is
in
that
room
with
his
mother
she
said
and
his
mother
has
the
yellow
fever
come
we
will
go
to
and
she
put
her
hand
upon
the
door
yellow
fever
cried
the
alcalde
and
his
voice
was
thick
with
terror
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
as
he
stood
rooted
to
the
floor
i
did
not
wonder
then
but
i
have
since
thought
it
remarkable
that
the
words
spoken
low
by
both
of
them
should
have
been
caught
up
on
the
banquette
and
passed
into
the
street
impassive
i
heard
it
echoed
from
a
score
of
throats
i
saw
men
and
women
stampeding
like
frightened
sheep
i
heard
their
footfalls
and
their
cries
as
they
ran
a
tawdry
constable
who
held
with
a
trembling
hand
the
bridle
of
the
tired
horse
alone
remained
yellow
fever
the
alcalde
repeated
the
vicomtesse
inclined
her
head
he
was
silent
again
for
a
while
uncertain
and
then
without
comprehending
i
saw
the
man
s
eyes
grow
smaller
and
a
smile
play
about
his
mouth
he
looked
at
the
vicomtesse
with
a
new
admiration
to
which
she
paid
no
heed
i
am
sorry
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
began
but
but
you
do
not
believe
that
i
speak
the
truth
she
replied
quietly
he
winced
will
you
follow
me
she
said
turning
again
he
had
started
plainly
in
an
agony
of
fear
when
a
sound
came
from
beyond
the
wall
that
brought
a
cry
to
his
lips
her
manner
changed
to
one
of
stinging
scorn
you
are
a
coward
she
said
i
will
bring
the
gentleman
to
you
if
he
can
be
got
to
leave
the
no
said
the
alcalde
no
i
i
will
go
to
him
madame
la
but
she
did
not
open
the
door
listen
she
said
in
a
tone
of
authority
i
myself
have
been
to
his
excellency
concerning
this
gentleman
you
madame
la
vicomtesse
i
will
open
the
door
she
continued
impatient
at
the
interruption
and
you
will
see
him
then
i
shall
write
a
letter
which
you
will
take
to
the
governor
the
gentleman
will
not
try
to
escape
for
his
mother
is
dying
besides
he
could
not
get
out
of
the
city
you
may
leave
your
constable
where
he
is
or
the
man
may
come
in
and
stand
at
this
door
in
sight
of
the
gentleman
while
you
are
gone
if
he
and
then
said
the
alcalde
it
is
my
belief
that
his
excellency
will
allow
the
gentleman
to
remain
here
and
that
you
will
be
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
running
any
further
as
she
spoke
she
opened
the
door
softly
the
room
was
still
now
still
as
death
and
the
alcalde
went
forward
on
tiptoe
i
saw
him
peering
in
i
saw
him
backing
away
again
like
a
man
in
mortal
fear
yes
it
is
he
it
is
the
man
he
stammered
he
put
his
hand
to
his
brow
the
vicomtesse
closed
the
door
and
without
a
glance
at
him
went
quickly
to
the
table
and
began
to
write
she
had
no
thought
of
consulting
the
man
again
of
asking
his
permission
although
she
wrote
rapidly
five
minutes
must
have
gone
by
before
the
note
was
finished
and
folded
and
sealed
she
held
it
out
to
him
take
this
to
his
excellency
she
said
and
bring
me
his
the
alcalde
bowed
murmured
her
title
and
went
lamely
out
of
the
house
he
was
plainly
in
an
agony
of
uncertainty
as
to
his
duty
but
he
glanced
at
the
vicomtesse
and
went
flipping
the
note
nervously
with
his
finger
nail
he
paused
for
a
few
words
with
the
tawdry
constable
who
sat
down
on
the
banquette
after
his
chief
had
gone
still
clinging
to
the
bridle
the
vicomtesse
went
to
the
doorway
looked
at
him
and
closed
the
battened
doors
the
constable
did
not
protest
the
day
was
fading
without
and
the
room
was
almost
in
darkness
as
she
crossed
over
to
the
little
mantel
and
stood
with
her
head
laid
upon
her
arm
i
did
not
disturb
her
the
minutes
passed
the
light
waned
until
i
could
see
her
no
longer
and
yet
i
knew
that
she
had
not
moved
the
strange
sympathy
between
us
kept
me
silent
until
i
heard
her
voice
calling
my
name
yes
i
answered
the
candle
i
drew
out
my
and
lighted
the
wick
she
had
turned
and
was
facing
me
even
as
she
had
faced
me
the
night
before
the
night
before
the
greatest
part
of
my
life
seemed
to
have
passed
since
then
i
remember
wondering
that
she
did
not
look
tired
her
face
was
sad
her
voice
was
sad
and
it
had
an
ineffable
sweet
quality
at
such
times
that
was
all
its
own
the
alcalde
should
be
coming
back
she
said
yes
i
answered
these
were
our
words
yet
we
scarce
heeded
their
meaning
between
us
was
drawn
a
subtler
communion
than
speech
and
we
dared
neither
of
us
to
risk
speech
she
searched
my
face
but
her
lips
were
closed
she
did
not
take
my
hand
again
as
in
the
afternoon
she
turned
away
i
knew
what
she
would
have
said
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
we
went
together
to
open
it
and
the
alcalde
stood
on
the
step
he
held
in
his
hand
a
long
letter
on
which
the
red
seal
caught
the
light
and
he
gave
the
letter
to
the
vicomtesse
with
a
bow
from
his
excellency
madame
la
she
broke
the
seal
went
to
the
table
and
read
then
she
looked
up
at
me
it
is
the
governor
s
permit
for
temple
to
remain
in
this
house
thank
you
she
said
to
the
alcalde
you
may
with
my
respectful
wishes
for
the
continued
good
health
of
madame
la
vicomtesse
said
the
alcalde
chapter
xi
in
the
midst
of
life
the
alcalde
had
stopped
on
the
step
with
an
exclamation
at
something
in
the
darkness
outside
and
he
backed
bowing
into
the
room
again
to
make
way
for
some
one
a
lady
slim
gowned
and
veiled
in
black
and
followed
by
a
negress
swept
past
him
the
lady
lifted
her
veil
and
stood
before
us
antoinette
exclaimed
the
vicomtesse
going
to
her
the
girl
did
not
answer
at
once
her
suffering
seemed
to
have
brought
upon
her
a
certain
acceptance
of
misfortune
as
inevitable
her
face
framed
in
the
black
veil
was
never
more
beautiful
than
on
that
night
what
is
the
alcalde
doing
here
she
said
the
officer
himself
answered
the
question
i
am
leaving
mademoiselle
said
he
he
reached
out
his
hands
toward
her
appealingly
do
you
not
remember
me
mademoiselle
you
brought
the
good
sister
to
see
my
i
remember
you
said
antoinette
do
not
stay
here
mademoiselle
he
cried
there
is
there
is
yellow
so
that
is
it
said
antoinette
unheeding
him
and
looking
at
her
cousin
she
has
yellow
fever
then
i
beg
you
to
come
away
mademoiselle
the
man
entreated
please
go
she
said
to
him
he
looked
at
her
and
went
out
silently
closing
the
doors
after
him
why
was
he
here
she
asked
again
he
came
to
get
temple
my
dear
said
the
vicomtesse
the
girl
s
lips
framed
his
name
but
did
not
speak
it
where
is
he
she
asked
slowly
the
vicomtesse
pointed
towards
the
bedroom
in
there
she
answered
with
his
he
came
to
her
antoinette
asked
quite
simply
the
vicomtesse
glanced
at
me
and
drew
the
veil
gently
from
the
girl
s
shoulders
she
led
her
unresisting
to
a
chair
i
looked
at
them
the
difference
in
their
ages
was
not
so
great
both
had
suffered
cruelly
one
had
seen
the
world
the
other
had
not
and
yet
the
contrast
lay
not
here
both
had
followed
the
gospel
of
helpfulness
to
others
but
one
as
a
religieuse
innocent
of
the
sin
around
her
though
poignant
of
the
sorrow
it
caused
the
other
knowing
evil
with
an
insight
that
went
far
beyond
intuition
fought
with
that
too
i
will
tell
you
antoinette
began
the
vicomtesse
it
was
as
you
said
ritchie
and
i
found
him
at
lamarque
s
he
had
not
taken
your
money
he
did
not
even
know
that
auguste
had
gone
to
see
you
he
did
not
even
know
she
said
bending
over
the
girl
that
he
was
on
your
father
s
plantation
when
we
told
him
that
he
would
have
left
it
at
yes
she
said
he
did
not
know
that
his
mother
was
still
in
new
orleans
and
when
we
told
him
how
ill
she
was
he
would
have
come
to
her
then
it
was
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
persuade
him
to
wait
until
we
had
seen
monsieur
de
carondelet
ritchie
and
i
came
directly
to
town
and
saw
his
it
was
characteristic
of
the
vicomtesse
that
she
told
this
almost
with
a
man
s
brevity
that
she
omitted
the
stress
and
trouble
and
pain
of
it
all
these
things
were
done
the
tact
and
skill
and
character
of
her
who
had
accomplished
them
were
not
spoken
of
the
girl
listened
immovable
her
lips
parted
and
her
eyes
far
away
suddenly
with
an
awakening
she
turned
to
hélène
you
did
this
she
cried
mr
ritchie
and
i
together
said
the
vicomtesse
her
next
exclamation
was
an
odd
one
showing
how
the
mind
works
at
such
a
time
but
his
excellency
was
having
his
siesta
said
antoinette
again
hélène
glanced
at
me
but
i
can
not
be
sure
that
she
smiled
we
thought
the
matter
of
sufficient
importance
to
awake
his
excellency
said
hélène
and
his
excellency
asked
antoinette
in
that
moment
all
three
of
us
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
tragedy
behind
the
wall
his
excellency
thought
so
too
when
we
had
explained
it
sufficiently
hélène
answered
the
girl
seemed
suddenly
to
throw
off
the
weight
of
her
grief
she
seized
the
hand
of
the
vicomtesse
in
both
of
her
own
the
baron
pardoned
him
she
cried
tell
me
what
his
excellency
said
why
are
you
keeping
it
from
me
hush
my
dear
said
the
vicomtesse
yes
he
pardoned
him
temple
was
to
have
come
to
the
city
with
an
officer
ritchie
and
i
came
to
this
house
together
and
we
found
yes
yes
said
antoinette
mr
ritchie
wrote
to
temple
that
his
excellency
was
to
send
for
him
but
andré
told
him
of
the
fever
and
he
came
here
in
the
face
of
danger
to
see
her
before
she
died
he
galloped
past
the
sentry
at
the
gate
and
the
alcalde
followed
him
from
and
came
here
to
arrest
him
cried
antoinette
before
the
vicomtesse
could
prevent
her
she
sprang
from
her
chair
ran
to
the
door
and
was
peering
out
into
the
darkness
is
the
alcalde
waiting
no
no
said
the
vicomtesse
gently
bringing
her
back
i
wrote
to
his
excellency
and
we
have
his
permission
for
temple
to
remain
suddenly
antoinette
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
facing
the
candle
her
hands
clasped
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
we
started
hélène
and
i
as
we
looked
at
her
what
is
it
my
dear
said
the
vicomtesse
laying
a
hand
on
her
arm
he
will
take
it
she
said
he
will
take
the
a
strange
thing
happened
many
many
times
have
i
thought
of
it
since
and
i
did
not
know
its
meaning
then
i
had
looked
to
see
the
vicomtesse
comfort
her
but
hélène
took
a
step
towards
me
my
eyes
met
hers
and
in
them
reflected
was
the
terror
i
had
seen
in
antoinette
s
at
that
instant
i
too
forgot
the
girl
and
we
turned
to
see
that
she
had
sunk
down
weeping
in
the
chair
then
we
both
went
to
her
i
through
some
instinct
i
did
not
fathom
hélène
s
hand
resting
on
antoinette
s
shoulder
trembled
there
it
may
well
have
been
my
own
weakness
which
made
me
think
her
body
swayed
which
made
me
reach
out
as
if
to
catch
her
however
marvellous
her
strength
and
fortitude
these
could
not
last
forever
and
heaven
help
me
my
own
were
fast
failing
once
the
room
had
seemed
to
me
all
in
darkness
then
i
saw
the
vicomtesse
leaning
tenderly
over
her
cousin
and
whispering
in
her
ear
and
antoinette
rising
clinging
to
her
i
will
go
she
faltered
i
will
go
he
must
not
know
i
have
been
here
you
you
will
not
tell
him
no
i
shall
not
tell
him
answered
the
vicomtesse
and
you
will
send
word
to
me
hélène
yes
antoinette
kissed
her
and
began
to
adjust
her
veil
mechanically
i
looked
on
bewildered
by
the
workings
of
the
feminine
mind
why
was
she
going
the
vicomtesse
gave
me
no
hint
but
suddenly
the
girl
s
arms
fell
to
her
sides
and
she
stood
staring
not
so
much
as
a
cry
escaping
her
the
bedroom
doors
had
been
opened
and
between
them
was
the
tall
figure
of
nicholas
temple
so
they
met
again
after
many
years
and
she
who
had
parted
them
had
brought
them
together
once
more
he
came
a
step
into
the
room
as
though
her
eyes
had
drawn
him
so
far
even
then
he
did
not
speak
her
name
go
he
said
go
you
must
not
stay
here
go
she
bowed
her
head
i
was
going
she
answered
i
i
am
but
you
must
go
at
once
he
cried
excitedly
do
you
know
what
is
in
there
and
he
pointed
towards
the
bedroom
yes
yes
i
know
she
said
i
then
go
he
cried
as
it
is
you
have
risked
too
she
lifted
up
her
head
and
looked
at
him
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
a
tremulous
note
of
joy
in
the
midst
of
sorrow
it
was
of
her
he
was
thinking
and
you
she
said
you
have
come
and
she
is
my
mother
he
answered
god
knows
it
was
the
least
i
could
have
twice
she
had
changed
before
our
eyes
and
now
we
beheld
a
new
and
yet
more
startling
transformation
when
she
spoke
there
was
no
reproach
in
her
voice
but
triumph
antoinette
undid
her
veil
yes
she
is
your
mother
she
answered
but
for
many
years
she
has
been
my
friend
i
will
go
to
her
she
can
not
forbid
me
now
hélène
has
been
with
her
she
said
turning
to
where
the
vicomtesse
stood
watching
her
intently
hélène
has
been
with
her
and
shall
i
who
have
longed
to
see
her
these
many
years
leave
her
now
but
you
were
going
he
cried
beside
himself
with
apprehension
at
this
new
turning
you
told
me
that
you
were
truly
man
is
born
without
perception
yes
i
told
you
that
she
replied
almost
defiantly
and
why
were
you
going
he
demanded
then
i
had
a
sudden
desire
to
shake
him
antoinette
was
mute
you
yourself
must
find
the
answer
to
that
question
temple
said
the
vicomtesse
quietly
he
turned
and
stared
at
hélène
and
she
seemed
to
smile
then
as
his
eyes
went
back
irresistibly
to
the
other
a
light
that
was
wonderful
to
see
dawned
and
grew
in
them
i
shall
never
forget
him
as
he
stood
handsome
and
fearless
a
gentleman
still
despite
his
years
of
wandering
and
adventure
and
in
this
supreme
moment
unselfish
the
wilful
masterful
boy
had
become
a
man
at
last
he
started
forward
stopped
trembling
with
a
shock
of
remembrance
and
gave
back
again
you
can
not
come
he
said
i
can
not
let
you
take
this
risk
tell
her
she
can
not
come
madame
he
said
to
hélène
for
the
love
of
god
send
her
home
but
there
were
forces
which
even
hélène
could
not
stem
he
had
turned
to
go
back
he
had
seized
the
door
but
antoinette
was
before
him
custom
does
not
weigh
at
such
a
time
had
she
not
read
his
avowal
she
had
his
hand
in
hers
heedless
of
us
who
watched
at
first
he
sought
to
free
himself
but
she
clung
to
it
with
all
the
strength
of
her
love
yet
she
did
not
look
up
at
him
i
will
come
with
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
will
come
with
you
how
quaintly
she
spoke
his
name
and
gently
and
timidly
ay
and
with
a
supreme
courage
true
to
him
through
all
those
numb
years
of
waiting
this
was
a
little
thing
that
they
should
face
death
together
a
little
thing
and
yet
the
greatest
joy
that
god
can
bestow
upon
a
good
woman
he
looked
down
at
her
with
a
great
tenderness
he
spoke
her
name
and
i
knew
that
he
had
taken
her
at
last
into
his
arms
come
he
said
they
went
in
together
and
the
doors
closed
behind
them
antoinette
s
maid
was
on
the
step
and
the
vicomtesse
and
i
were
alone
once
more
in
the
little
parlor
i
remember
well
the
sense
of
unreality
i
had
and
how
it
troubled
me
i
remember
how
what
i
had
seen
and
heard
was
turning
turning
in
my
mind
nick
had
come
back
to
antoinette
they
were
together
in
that
room
and
temple
was
dying
dying
no
it
could
not
be
so
again
i
was
in
the
garden
at
les
îles
on
a
night
that
was
all
perfume
and
i
saw
the
flowers
all
ghostly
white
under
the
moon
and
then
suddenly
i
was
watching
the
green
candle
sputter
and
out
of
the
stillness
came
a
cry
the
sereno
calling
the
hour
of
the
night
how
my
head
throbbed
it
was
keeping
time
to
some
rhythm
i
knew
not
what
yes
it
was
the
song
my
father
used
to
sing
i
ve
faught
on
land
i
ve
faught
at
sea
at
hame
i
ve
faught
my
aunty
o
but
new
orleans
was
hot
burning
hot
and
this
could
not
be
cold
i
felt
ah
i
had
it
the
water
was
cold
going
to
vincennes
so
cold
a
voice
called
me
no
matter
where
i
had
gone
i
think
i
would
have
come
back
at
the
sound
of
it
i
listened
intently
that
i
might
lose
no
word
of
what
it
said
i
knew
the
voice
had
it
not
called
to
me
many
times
in
my
life
before
but
now
there
was
fear
in
it
and
fear
gave
it
a
vibrant
sweetness
fear
gave
it
a
quality
that
made
it
mine
mine
you
are
that
was
all
it
said
and
it
called
from
across
the
sea
and
the
sea
was
cold
cold
and
green
under
the
gray
light
if
she
who
called
to
me
would
only
come
with
the
warmth
of
her
love
the
sea
faded
the
light
fell
and
i
was
in
the
eternal
cold
of
space
between
the
whirling
worlds
if
she
could
but
find
me
was
not
that
her
hand
in
mine
did
i
not
feel
her
near
me
touching
me
i
wondered
that
i
should
hear
myself
as
i
answered
her
i
am
not
ill
i
said
speak
to
me
she
was
pressing
my
hand
now
i
saw
her
bending
over
me
i
felt
her
hair
as
it
brushed
my
face
she
spoke
again
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
and
to
that
alone
i
listened
the
words
were
decisive
of
command
and
with
them
some
sense
as
of
a
haven
near
came
to
me
another
voice
answered
in
a
strange
tongue
saying
seemingly
oui
madame
malé
couri
bon
djé
malé
couri
i
heard
the
doors
close
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
running
and
dying
along
the
banquette
and
after
that
my
shoulders
were
raised
and
something
wrapped
about
them
then
stillness
again
the
stillness
that
comes
between
waking
and
sleeping
between
pain
and
calm
and
at
times
when
i
felt
her
hand
fall
into
mine
or
press
against
my
brow
the
pain
seemed
more
endurable
after
that
i
recall
being
lifted
being
borne
along
i
opened
my
eyes
once
and
saw
above
a
wall
the
moon
all
yellow
and
distorted
in
the
sky
then
a
gate
clicked
dungeon
blackness
again
ascent
oblivion
chapter
xii
visions
and
an
awakening
i
have
still
sharp
memories
of
the
tortures
of
that
illness
though
it
befell
so
long
ago
at
times
when
my
mind
was
gone
from
me
i
cried
out
i
know
not
what
of
jargon
of
sentiment
of
the
horrors
i
had
beheld
in
my
life
i
lived
again
the
pleasant
scenes
warped
and
burlesqued
almost
beyond
cognizance
and
the
tragedies
were
magnified
a
hundred
fold
thus
it
would
be
on
the
low
white
ceiling
five
cracks
came
together
and
that
was
a
device
and
the
device
would
take
on
color
like
the
sumach
in
the
autumn
and
streaks
of
vermilion
and
two
glowing
coals
that
were
eyes
and
above
them
eagles
feathers
and
the
cracks
became
bramble
bushes
i
was
behind
the
log
and
at
times
i
started
and
knew
that
it
was
a
hideous
dream
and
again
polly
ann
was
clutching
me
and
praying
me
to
hold
back
and
i
broke
from
her
and
splashed
over
the
slippery
limestone
bed
of
the
creek
to
fight
through
all
the
fearful
struggle
i
heard
her
calling
me
piteously
to
come
back
to
her
when
the
brute
got
me
under
water
i
could
not
hear
her
but
her
voice
came
back
suddenly
as
when
a
door
opens
and
it
was
like
the
wind
singing
in
the
poplars
was
it
polly
ann
s
voice
again
i
sat
with
nick
under
the
trees
on
the
lawn
at
temple
bow
and
the
world
was
dark
with
the
coming
storm
i
knew
and
he
knew
that
the
storm
was
brewing
that
i
might
be
thrust
out
into
it
and
then
in
the
blackness
when
the
air
was
filled
with
all
the
fair
things
of
the
earth
torn
asunder
a
beautiful
woman
came
through
the
noise
and
the
fury
and
we
ran
to
her
and
clung
to
her
skirts
thinking
we
had
found
safety
but
she
thrust
us
forth
into
the
blackness
with
a
smile
as
though
she
were
flinging
papers
out
of
the
window
she
too
grew
out
of
the
design
in
the
cracks
of
the
ceiling
and
a
greater
fear
seized
me
at
sight
of
her
features
than
when
the
red
face
came
out
of
the
brambles
my
constant
torment
was
thirst
i
was
in
the
prairie
and
it
was
scorched
and
brown
to
the
horizon
i
searched
and
prayed
pitifully
for
water
for
only
a
sip
of
the
brown
water
with
the
specks
in
it
that
was
in
the
swamp
there
were
no
swamps
i
was
on
the
bed
in
the
cabin
looking
at
the
shifts
and
hunting
shirts
on
the
pegs
and
polly
ann
would
bring
a
gourdful
of
clear
water
from
the
spring
as
far
as
the
door
nay
once
i
got
it
to
my
lips
and
it
was
gone
sometimes
a
young
man
in
a
hunting
shirt
his
face
tanned
and
his
fair
hair
bleached
by
the
sun
would
bring
the
water
he
was
the
hero
of
my
boyhood
and
part
of
him
indeed
was
in
me
and
i
would
have
followed
him
again
to
vincennes
despite
the
tortures
of
the
damned
but
when
i
spoke
his
name
he
grew
stouter
before
me
and
his
eyes
lost
their
lustre
and
his
hair
turned
gray
and
his
hand
shook
as
he
held
out
the
gourd
and
spilled
its
contents
ere
i
could
reach
them
sometimes
another
brought
the
water
and
at
sight
of
her
i
would
tremble
and
grow
faint
and
i
had
not
the
strength
to
reach
for
it
she
would
look
at
me
with
eyes
that
laughed
despite
the
resolution
of
the
mouth
then
the
eyes
would
grow
pitiful
at
my
helplessness
and
she
would
murmur
my
name
there
was
some
reason
which
i
never
fathomed
why
she
could
not
give
me
the
water
and
her
own
suffering
seemed
greater
than
mine
because
of
it
so
great
did
it
seem
that
i
forgot
my
own
and
sought
to
comfort
her
then
she
would
go
away
very
slowly
and
i
would
hear
her
calling
to
me
in
the
wind
from
the
stars
to
which
i
looked
up
from
the
prairie
it
was
she
i
thought
who
ordered
the
world
who
when
women
were
lost
and
men
cried
out
in
distress
came
to
them
calmly
ministered
to
them
deftly
once
perhaps
a
score
of
times
i
can
not
tell
was
limned
on
the
ceiling
where
the
cracks
were
her
miniature
and
i
knew
what
was
coming
and
shuddered
and
cried
aloud
because
i
could
not
stop
it
i
saw
the
narrow
street
of
a
strange
city
deep
down
between
high
houses
houses
with
gratings
on
the
lowest
windows
with
studded
doors
with
upper
stories
that
toppled
over
to
shut
out
the
light
of
the
sky
with
slated
roofs
that
slanted
and
twisted
this
way
and
that
and
dormers
peeping
from
them
down
in
the
street
instead
of
the
king
s
white
soldiers
was
a
foul
unkempt
rabble
creeping
out
of
its
damp
places
jesting
cursing
singing
and
in
the
midst
of
the
rabble
a
lady
sat
in
a
cart
high
above
it
unmoved
she
was
the
lady
of
the
miniature
a
window
in
one
of
the
jutting
houses
was
flung
open
a
little
man
leaned
out
excitedly
and
i
knew
him
too
he
was
jean
baptiste
lenoir
and
he
cried
out
in
a
shrill
voice
you
must
take
off
her
ruff
citizens
you
must
take
off
her
ruff
there
came
a
blessed
day
when
my
thirst
was
gone
when
i
looked
up
at
the
cracks
in
the
ceiling
and
wondered
why
they
did
not
change
into
horrors
i
watched
them
a
long
long
time
and
it
seemed
incredible
that
they
should
still
remain
cracks
beyond
that
i
would
not
go
into
speculation
i
dared
not
venture
they
remained
cracks
and
i
went
to
sleep
thanking
god
when
i
awoke
a
breeze
came
in
cool
fitful
gusts
and
on
it
the
scent
of
camellias
i
thought
of
turning
my
head
and
i
remember
wondering
for
a
long
time
over
the
expediency
of
this
move
what
would
happen
if
i
did
perhaps
the
visions
would
come
back
perhaps
my
head
would
come
off
finally
i
decided
to
risk
it
and
the
first
thing
that
i
beheld
was
a
fan
moving
slowly
that
fact
gave
me
food
for
thought
and
contented
me
for
a
while
then
i
hit
upon
the
idea
that
there
must
be
something
behind
the
fan
i
was
distinctly
pleased
by
this
astuteness
and
i
spent
more
time
in
speculation
whatever
it
was
it
had
a
tantalizing
elusiveness
keeping
the
fan
between
it
and
me
this
was
not
fair
i
had
an
inspiration
if
i
feigned
to
be
asleep
perhaps
the
thing
behind
the
fan
would
come
out
i
shut
my
eyes
the
breeze
continued
steadily
surely
no
human
being
could
fan
as
long
as
that
without
being
tired
i
opened
my
eyes
twice
but
the
thing
was
inscrutable
then
i
heard
a
sound
that
i
knew
to
be
a
footstep
upon
boards
a
voice
whispered
the
delirium
has
left
another
voice
a
man
s
voice
answered
thank
god
let
me
fan
him
you
are
i
am
not
tired
answered
the
first
voice
i
do
not
see
how
you
have
stood
it
said
the
man
s
voice
you
will
kill
yourself
madame
la
vicomtesse
the
danger
is
past
i
hope
so
temple
said
the
first
voice
please
go
away
you
may
come
back
in
half
an
i
heard
the
footsteps
retreating
then
i
said
i
am
not
the
fan
stopped
for
a
brief
instant
and
then
went
on
vibrating
inexorably
i
was
entranced
at
the
thought
of
what
i
had
done
i
had
spoken
though
indeed
it
seemed
to
have
had
no
effect
could
it
be
that
i
hadn
t
spoken
i
began
to
be
frightened
at
this
when
gradually
something
crept
into
my
mind
and
drove
the
fear
out
i
did
not
grasp
what
this
was
at
first
it
was
like
the
first
staining
of
wine
on
the
eastern
sky
to
one
who
sees
a
sunrise
and
then
the
thought
grew
even
as
the
light
grows
tinged
by
prismatic
colors
until
at
length
a
memory
struck
into
my
soul
like
a
shaft
of
light
i
spoke
her
name
unblushingly
aloud
hélène
the
fan
stopped
there
was
a
silence
that
seemed
an
eternity
as
the
palm
leaf
trembled
in
her
hand
there
was
an
answer
that
strove
tenderly
to
command
hush
you
must
not
talk
she
said
never
i
believe
came
such
supreme
happiness
with
obedience
i
felt
her
hand
upon
my
brow
and
the
fan
moved
again
i
fell
asleep
once
more
from
sheer
weariness
of
joy
she
was
there
beside
me
she
had
been
there
beside
me
through
it
all
and
it
was
her
touch
which
had
brought
me
back
to
life
i
dreamed
of
her
when
i
awoke
again
her
image
was
in
my
mind
and
i
let
it
rest
there
in
contemplation
but
presently
i
thought
of
the
fan
turned
my
head
and
it
was
not
there
a
great
fear
seized
me
i
looked
out
of
the
open
door
where
the
morning
sun
threw
the
checkered
shadows
of
the
honeysuckle
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
and
over
the
railing
to
the
in
the
the
place
struck
a
chord
in
my
memory
then
my
eyes
wandered
back
into
the
room
there
was
a
polished
dresser
a
crucifix
and
a
in
the
corner
a
fauteuil
and
another
chair
at
my
bed
the
floor
was
rubbed
to
an
immaculate
cleanliness
stained
yellow
and
on
it
lay
clean

and

across

countenance
of
the

suspiciously
yo

powe
rful
cute
marse
lindy
set
her
lips
with
a
mighty
resolve
to
be
silent
i
heard
some
one
coming
along
the
gallery
and
then
i
saw
nick
s
tall
figure
looming
up
behind
her
davy
he
cried

herself
up
doggedly
yo

nonsense
lindy
he
answered
i

been
in
there
as
much
as
you
and
he
took
hold
of
her
thin
arm
and
pulled
her
back
marse
nick
she
cried
she
ll
done
fin
out
dat
you

pish
said
nick
with
a
fine
air
who
s
afraid
of
her
lindy
s
face
took
on
an
expression
of
intense
amusement
yo
is
for
one
marse
nick
she
answered
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
servant
i
done
seed
yo
skedaddle
when
she
tut
said
nick
grandly
i
run
from
no
woman
eh
davy
he
pushed
past
the
protesting
lindy
into
the
room
and
took
my
hand
egad
you
have
been
near
the
devil
s
precipice
my
son
a
man
would
have
gone
in
his
eyes
was
all
the
strange
affection
he
had
had
for
me
ever
since
we
had
been
boys
at
temple
bow
together
davy
i
reckon
life
wouldn
t
have
been
worth
much
if
you
d
i
did
not
answer
i
could
only
stare
at
him
mutely
grateful
for
such
an
affection
in
all
his
wild
life
he
had
been
true
to
me
and
he
had
clung
to
me
stanchly
in
this
my
greatest
peril
thankful
that
he
was
here
i
searched
his
handsome
person
with
my
eyes
he
was
dressed
as
usual
with
care
and
fashion
in
linen
breeches
and
a
light
gray
coat
and
a
filmy
ruffle
at
his
neck
but
i
thought
there
had
come
a
change
into
his
face
the
reckless
quality
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
it
yet
the
spirit
and
daring
remained
and
with
these
all
the
sweetness
that
was
once
in
his
smile
there
were
lines
under
his
eyes
that
spoke
of
vigils
you
have
been
sitting
up
with
me
i
said
of
course
he
answered
patting
my
shoulder
of
course
i
have
what
did
you
think
i
would
be
doing
what
was
the
matter
with
me
i
asked
nothing
much
he
said
lightly
a
touch
of
the
sun
and
a
great
deal
of
overwork
in
behalf
of
your
friends
now
keep
still
or
i
will
be
getting
i
was
silent
for
a
while
turning
over
this
answer
in
my
mind
then
i
said
i
had
yellow
he
started
it
is
no
use
to
lie
to
you
he
replied
you
re
too
i
was
silent
again
for
a
while
nick
i
said
you
had
no
right
to
stay
here
you
have
other
responsibilities
he
laughed
it
was
the
old
buoyant
boyish
laugh
of
sheer
happiness
and
i
felt
the
better
for
hearing
it
if
you
begin
to
preach
parson
i
ll
go
i
vow
i
ll
have
no
more
sermonizing
davy
he
cried
isn
t
she
just
the
dearest
sweetest
most
beautiful
person
in
the
world
i
smiled
where
is
she
i
asked
temporizing
nick
was
not
a
subtle
person
and
i
was
ready
to
follow
him
at
great
length
in
the
praise
of
antoinette
i
hope
she
is
not
we
made
her
go
to
les
îles
said
he
and
you
risked
your
life
and
stayed
here
without
her
i
said
as
for
risking
life
that
kind
of
criticism
doesn
t
come
well
from
you
and
as
for
antoinette
he
added
with
a
smile
i
expect
to
see
something
of
her
later
well
i
answered
with
a
sigh
of
supreme
content
you
have
been
a
fool
all
your
life
and
i
hope
that
she
will
make
you
you
never
could
make
me
so
said
nick
and
besides
i
don
t
think
you
ve
been
so
damned
sensible
we
were
silent
again
for
a
space
davy
he
asked
do
you
remember
what
i
said
when
you
had
that
miniature
here
you
said
a
great
many
things
i
i
told
you
to
consider
carefully
the
masterful
features
of
that
lady
and
to
thank
god
you
hadn
t
married
her
i
vow
i
never
thought
she
d
turn
up
upon
my
oath
i
never
thought
i
should
be
such
a
blind
slave
as
i
have
been
for
the
last
fortnight
faith
monsieur
de
gré
is
a
strong
man
but
he
was
no
more
than
a
puppet
in
his
own
house
when
he
came
back
here
for
a
day
that
lady
could
govern
a
province
no
a
kingdom
but
i
warrant
you
there
would
be
no
climbing
of
balconies
in
her
dominions
i
have
never
been
so
generalled
in
my
i
had
no
answer
for
these
comments
the
deuce
of
it
is
the
way
she
does
it
he
continued
plainly
bent
on
relieving
himself
there
s
no
noise
no
fuss
but
you
must
obey
you
don
t
know
why
and
yet
you
may
flay
me
if
i
don
t
love
love
her
i
repeated
she
saved
your
life
said
nick
i
don
t
believe
any
other
woman
could
have
done
it
she
hadn
t
any
thought
of
her
own
she
has
been
here
in
this
room
almost
constantly
night
and
day
and
she
never
let
you
go
the
little
french
doctor
gave
you
up
not
she
she
held
on
cursed
if
i
see
why
she
did
nor
i
i
answered
well
he
said
apologetically
of
course
i
would
have
done
it
but
you
weren
t
anything
to
her
yes
egad
you
were
something
to
be
saved
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
she
had
you
brought
back
here
we
are
in
monsieur
de
gré
s
house
by
the
way
in
a
litter
and
she
took
command
as
though
she
had
nursed
yellow
fever
cases
all
her
life
no
flurry
i
said
that
you
were
in
love
with
her
once
davy
when
i
saw
you
looking
at
the
portrait
i
take
it
back
of
course
a
man
could
be
very
fond
of
her
he
said
but
a
king
ought
to
have
married
her
as
for
that
poor
vicomte
she
s
tied
up
to
i
reckon
i
know
the
reason
why
he
didn
t
come
to
america
an
ordinary
man
would
have
no
chance
at
all
god
bless
her
he
cried
with
a
sudden
burst
of
feeling
i
would
die
for
her
myself
she
got
me
out
of
a
barrel
of
trouble
with
his
excellency
she
cared
for
my
mother
a
lonely
outcast
and
braved
death
herself
to
go
to
her
when
she
was
dying
of
the
fever
god
bless
her
lindy
was
standing
in
the
doorway
lan
sakes
marse
nick
yo
gotter
go
she
said
he
rose
and
pressed
my
fingers
i
ll
go
he
said
and
left
me
lindy
seated
herself
in
the
chair
she
held
in
her
hand
a
bowl
of
beef
broth
from
this
she
fed
me
in
silence
and
when
she
left
she
commanded
me
to
sleep
informing
me
that
she
would
be
on
the
gallery
within
call
but
i
did
not
sleep
at
once
nick
s
words
had
brought
back
a
fact
which
my
returning
consciousness
had
hitherto
ignored
the
birds
sang
in
the
and
when
the
breeze
stirred
it
was
ever
laden
with
a
new
scent
i
had
been
snatched
from
the
jaws
of
death
my
life
was
before
me
but
the
happiness
which
had
thrilled
me
was
gone
and
in
my
weakness
the
weight
of
the
sadness
which
had
come
upon
me
was
almost
unbearable
if
i
had
had
the
strength
i
would
have
risen
then
and
there
from
my
bed
i
would
have
fled
from
the
city
at
the
first
opportunity
as
it
was
i
lay
in
a
torture
of
thought
living
over
again
every
part
of
my
life
which
she
had
touched
i
remembered
the
first
long
yearning
look
i
had
given
the
miniature
at
madame
bouvet
s
i
had
not
loved
her
then
my
feeling
rather
had
been
a
mysterious
sympathy
with
and
admiration
for
this
brilliant
lady
whose
sphere
was
so
far
removed
from
mine
this
was
sufficiently
strange
again
in
the
years
of
my
struggle
for
livelihood
which
followed
i
dreamed
of
her
i
pictured
her
often
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
of
the
revolution
then
i
had
the
miniature
again
which
had
travelled
to
her
as
it
were
and
come
back
to
me
even
then
it
was
not
love
i
felt
but
an
unnamed
sentiment
for
one
whom
i
clothed
with
gifts
and
attributes
i
admired
constancy
an
ability
to
suffer
and
to
hide
decision
wit
refuge
for
the
weak
scorn
for
the
false
so
i
named
them
at
random
and
cherished
them
knowing
that
these
things
were
not
what
other
men
longed
for
in
women
nay
there
was
another
quality
which
i
believed
was
there
which
i
knew
was
there
a
supreme
tenderness
that
was
hidden
like
a
treasure
too
sacred
to
be
seen
i
did
not
seek
to
explain
the
mystery
which
had
brought
her
across
the
sea
into
that
little
garden
of
temple
s
and
into
my
heart
there
she
was
now
enthroned
deified
that
she
would
always
be
there
i
accepted
that
i
would
never
say
or
do
anything
not
in
consonance
with
her
standards
i
knew
that
i
would
suffer
much
i
was
sure
but
the
lees
of
that
suffering
i
should
hoard
because
they
came
from
her
what
might
have
been
i
tried
to
put
away
there
was
the
moment
i
thought
when
our
souls
had
met
in
the
little
parlor
in
the
rue
bourbon
i
should
never
know
this
i
knew
that
we
had
labored
together
to
bring
happiness
into
other
lives
then
came
another
thought
to
appall
me
unmindful
of
her
own
safety
she
had
nursed
me
back
to
life
through
all
the
horrors
of
the
fever
the
doctor
had
despaired
and
i
knew
that
by
the
very
force
that
was
in
her
she
had
saved
me
she
was
here
now
in
this
house
and
presently
she
would
be
coming
back
to
my
bedside
painfully
i
turned
my
face
to
the
wall
in
a
torment
of
humiliation
i
had
called
her
by
her
name
i
would
see
her
again
but
i
knew
not
whence
the
strength
for
that
ordeal
was
to
come
chapter
xiii
a
mystery
i
knew
by
the
light
that
it
was
evening
when
i
awoke
so
prisoners
mark
the
passing
of
the
days
by
a
bar
of
sun
light
and
as
i
looked
at
the
green
trees
in
the
courtyard
vaguely
troubled
by
i
knew
not
what
some
one
came
and
stood
in
the
doorway
it
was
nick
you
don
t
seem
very
cheerful
said
he
a
man
ought
to
be
who
has
been
snatched
out
of
the
you
seem
to
be
rather
too
sure
of
my
future
i
said
trying
to
smile
that
s
more
like
you
said
nick
egad
you
ought
to
be
happy
we
all
ought
to
be
happy
she
s
she
i
cried
who
s
gone
madame
la
vicomtesse
he
replied
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
stood
over
me
but
she
s
left
instructions
with
me
for
lindy
as
long
as
monsieur
de
carondelet
s
bando
de
buen
gobierno
you
are
not
to
do
this
and
you
are
not
to
do
that
you
are
to
eat
such
and
such
things
you
are
to
be
made
to
sleep
at
such
and
such
times
she
came
in
here
about
an
hour
ago
and
took
a
long
look
at
you
before
she
she
was
not
ill
i
said
faintly
faith
i
don
t
know
why
she
was
not
he
said
she
has
done
enough
to
tire
out
an
army
but
she
seems
well
and
fairly
happy
she
had
her
joke
at
my
expense
as
she
went
through
the
and
she
reminded
me
that
we
were
to
send
a
report
by
andré
every
chagrin
depression
relief
bewilderment
all
were
struggling
within
me
where
did
she
go
i
asked
at
last
to
les
îles
he
said
you
are
to
be
brought
there
as
soon
as
you
are
strong
do
you
happen
to
know
why
she
went
i
said
now
how
the
deuce
should
i
know
he
answered
i
ve
done
everything
with
blind
servility
since
i
came
into
this
house
i
never
asked
for
any
reason
it
never
would
have
done
any
good
i
suppose
she
thought
that
you
were
well
on
the
road
to
recovery
and
she
knew
that
lindy
was
an
old
hand
and
then
the
doctor
is
to
come
why
didn
t
you
go
i
demanded
with
a
sudden
remembrance
that
he
was
staying
away
from
happiness
it
was
because
i
longed
for
another
taste
of
liberty
davy
he
laughed
you
and
i
will
have
an
time
here
together
a
deal
of
talk
and
perhaps
a
little
piquet
who
knows
my
strength
came
back
bit
by
bit
and
listening
to
his
happiness
did
much
to
ease
the
soreness
of
my
heart
while
the
light
lasted
it
was
in
the
night
watches
that
my
struggles
came
though
often
some
unwitting
speech
of
his
would
bring
back
the
pain
he
took
delight
in
telling
me
for
example
how
for
hours
at
a
time
i
had
been
in
a
fearful
delirium
the
lord
knows
what
foolishness
you
talked
davy
said
he
it
would
have
done
me
good
to
hear
you
had
you
been
in
your
right
but
you
did
hear
me
i
said
full
of
apprehensions
some
of
it
said
he
you
were
after
wilkinson
once
in
a
burrow
i
believe
and
you
swore
dreadfully
because
he
got
out
of
the
other
end
i
can
t
remember
all
the
things
you
said
oh
yes
once
you
were
talking
to
auguste
de
gré
about
money
i
repeated
in
a
sinking
voice
oh
a
lot
of
jargon
the
vicomtesse
pushed
me
out
of
the
room
and
after
that
i
was
never
allowed
to
be
there
when
you
had
those
flights
curse
the
mosquitoes
he
seized
a
fan
and
began
to
ply
it
vigorously
i
remember
you
were
giving
auguste
a
lecture
then
i
had
to
these
and
other
reminiscences
gave
me
sufficient
food
for
reflection
and
many
a
shudder
over
the
possibilities
of
my
ravings
she
had
put
him
out
no
wonder
after
a
while
i
was
carried
to
the
gallery
and
there
i
would
talk
to
the
little
doctor
about
the
yellow
fever
which
had
swept
the
city
monsieur
perrin
was
not
much
of
a
doctor
to
be
sure
and
he
had
a
heartier
dread
of
the
american
invasion
than
of
the
scourge
he
worshipped
the
vicomtesse
and
was
so
devoid
of
professional
pride
as
to
give
her
freely
all
credit
for
my
recovery
he
too
clothed
her
with
the
qualities
of
statesmanship
ha
monsieur
he
said
if
that
lady
had
been
king
of
france
do
you
think
there
would
have
been
any
states
general
any
red
bonnets
any
jacobins
or
cordeliers
parbleu
she
would
have
swept
the
vicemongers
and
traitors
out
of
the
palais
royal
itself
there
would
have
been
a
there
i
who
speak
to
you
know
every
day
nick
wrote
a
bulletin
to
be
sent
to
the
vicomtesse
and
he
took
a
fiendish
delight
in
the
composition
of
these
he
would
come
out
on
the
gallery
with
ink
and
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
try
to
enlist
my
help
he
would
insert
the
most
ridiculous
statements
as
for
instance
davy
is
worse
having
bribed
lindy
to
give
him
a
pint
of
madeira
against
my
or
davy
feigns
to
be
sinking
rapidly
because
he
wishes
to
have
you
indeed
i
was
always
in
a
torture
of
doubt
to
know
what
the
rascal
had
sent
his
company
was
most
agreeable
when
he
was
recounting
the
many
adventures
he
had
had
during
the
five
years
after
he
had
left
new
orleans
and
been
lost
to
me
these
would
fill
a
book
and
a
most
readable
book
it
would
be
if
written
in
his
own
speech
his
love
for
the
excitement
of
the
frontier
had
finally
drawn
him
back
to
the
cumberland
country
near
nashville
and
he
had
actually
gone
so
far
as
to
raise
a
house
and
till
some
of
the
land
which
he
had
won
from
darnley
it
was
perhaps
characteristic
of
him
that
he
had
named
the
place
in
honor
of
the
game
which
had
put
him
in
possession
of
it
and
it
remains
to
this
day
he
was
going
back
there
with
antoinette
so
he
said
to
build
a
brick
mansion
and
to
live
a
respectable
life
the
rest
of
his
days
there
was
one
question
which
had
been
in
my
mind
to
ask
him
concerning
the
attitude
of
monsieur
de
gré
that
gentleman
with
madame
had
hurried
back
from
pointe
coupée
at
a
message
from
the
vicomtesse
and
had
gone
first
to
les
îles
to
see
antoinette
then
he
had
come
in
spite
of
the
fever
to
his
own
house
in
new
orleans
to
see
nick
himself
what
their
talk
had
been
i
never
knew
for
the
subject
was
too
painful
to
be
dwelt
upon
and
the
conversation
had
been
marked
by
frankness
on
both
sides
monsieur
de
gré
was
a
just
man
his
love
for
his
daughter
was
his
chief
passion
and
despite
all
that
had
happened
he
liked
nick
i
believe
he
could
not
wholly
blame
the
younger
man
and
he
forgave
him
temple
poor
lady
had
died
on
that
first
night
of
my
illness
and
it
was
her
punishment
that
she
had
not
known
her
son
or
her
son
s
happiness
whatever
sins
she
had
committed
in
her
wayward
life
were
atoned
for
and
by
her
death
i
firmly
believe
that
she
redeemed
him
she
lies
now
among
the
temples
in
charleston
and
on
the
stone
which
marks
her
grave
is
cut
no
line
that
hints
of
the
story
of
these
pages
one
bright
morning
when
nick
and
i
were
playing
cards
we
heard
some
one
mounting
the
stairs
and
to
my
surprise
and
embarrassment
i
beheld
monsieur
de
gré
emerging
on
the
gallery
he
was
in
white
linen
and
wore
a
broad
hat
which
he
took
from
his
head
as
he
advanced
he
had
aged
somewhat
his
hair
was
a
little
gray
but
otherwise
he
was
the
firm
dignified
personage
i
had
admired
on
this
same
gallery
five
years
before
good
morning
gentlemen
he
said
in
english
ha
do
not
rise
sir
to
me
he
patted
nick
s
shoulder
kindly
but
not
familiarly
as
he
passed
him
and
extended
his
hand
mr
ritchie
it
gives
me
more
pleasure
than
i
can
express
to
see
you
so
much
i
am
again
thrown
on
your
hospitality
sir
i
said
flushing
with
pleasure
at
this
friendliness
for
i
admired
and
respected
the
man
greatly
and
i
fear
i
have
been
a
burden
and
trouble
to
you
and
your
he
took
my
hand
and
pressed
it
characteristically
he
did
not
answer
this
and
i
remembered
he
was
always
careful
not
to
say
anything
which
might
smack
of
insincerity
i
had
a
glimpse
of
you
some
weeks
ago
he
said
thus
making
light
of
the
risk
he
had
run
you
are
a
different
man
now
you
may
thank
your
scotch
blood
and
your
strong
his
good
habits
have
done
him
some
good
after
all
put
in
my
irrepressible
cousin
monsieur
de
gré
smiled
nick
he
said
he
pronounced
the
name
quaintly
like
antoinette
his
good
habits
have
turned
out
to
be
some
advantage
to
you
ritchie
you
have
a
faithful
friend
at
he
patted
nick
s
shoulder
again
and
he
has
promised
me
to
settle
i
have
every
inducement
sir
said
nick
monsieur
de
gré
became
grave
you
have
indeed
monsieur
he
answered
i
have
just
come
from
perrin
s
david
he
added
may
i
call
you
so
well
then
i
have
just
come
from
perrin
s
and
he
says
you
may
be
moved
to
les
îles
this
very
afternoon
why
upon
my
word
he
exclaimed
staring
at
me
you
don
t
look
pleased
one
would
think
you
were
going
to
the
ah
said
nick
slyly
i
know
he
has
tasted
freedom
monsieur
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
will
be
in
command
i
flushed
nick
could
be
very
exasperating
you
must
not
mind
him
monsieur
i
said
i
do
not
mind
him
answered
monsieur
de
gré
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
he
is
a
sad
rogue
as
for
hélène
i
shall
not
know
how
to
thank
the
vicomtesse
i
said
she
has
done
me
the
greatest
service
one
person
can
do
hélène
is
a
good
woman
answered
monsieur
de
gré
simply
she
is
more
than
that
she
is
a
wonderful
woman
i
remember
telling
you
of
her
once
i
little
thought
then
that
she
would
ever
come
to
he
turned
to
me
dr
perrin
will
be
here
this
afternoon
david
and
he
will
have
you
dressed
between
five
and
six
if
all
goes
well
we
shall
start
for
les
îles
and
in
the
meantime
gentlemen
he
added
with
a
stateliness
that
was
natural
to
him
i
have
business
which
takes
me
to
my
s
monsieur
de
beauséjour
nick
leaned
over
the
gallery
and
watched
meditatively
his
prospective
leaving
the
he
got
me
out
of
a
devilish
bad
scrape
he
said
how
was
that
i
asked
listlessly
that
fat
little
baron
the
governor
was
for
deporting
me
for
running
past
the
sentry
and
giving
him
all
the
trouble
i
did
it
seems
that
the
vicomtesse
promised
to
explain
matters
in
a
note
which
she
wrote
and
never
did
explain
she
was
here
with
you
and
a
lot
she
cared
about
anything
else
lucky
that
monsieur
de
gré
came
back
now
his
excellency
graciously
allows
me
to
stay
here
if
i
behave
myself
until
i
get
i
do
not
know
how
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
it
passed
somehow
if
i
had
had
the
strength
then
i
believe
i
should
have
fled
i
was
to
see
her
again
to
feel
her
near
me
to
hear
her
voice
during
the
weeks
that
had
gone
by
i
had
schooled
myself
in
a
sense
to
the
inevitable
i
had
not
let
my
mind
dwell
upon
my
visit
to
les
îles
and
now
i
was
face
to
face
with
the
struggle
for
which
i
felt
i
had
not
the
strength
i
had
fought
one
battle
i
knew
that
a
fiercer
battle
was
to
come
in
due
time
the
doctor
arrived
and
while
he
prepared
me
for
my
departure
the
little
man
sought
with
misplaced
kindness
to
raise
my
spirits
was
not
monsieur
going
to
the
country
to
a
paradise
monsieur
so
perrin
had
noticed
had
a
turn
for
philosophy
could
two
more
able
and
brilliant
conversationalists
be
found
than
philippe
de
gré
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
and
there
was
the
happiness
of
that
strange
but
lovable
young
man
monsieur
temple
to
contemplate
he
was
in
luck
ce
beau
garçon
for
he
was
getting
an
angel
for
his
wife
did
monsieur
know
that
mademoiselle
antoinette
was
an
angel
at
last
i
was
ready
arrayed
in
my
best
on
the
gallery
when
monsieur
de
gré
came
andré
and
another
servant
carried
me
down
into
the
court
and
there
stood
a
painted
with
the
gré
arms
on
the
panels
my
father
imported
it
david
said
monsieur
de
gré
it
has
not
been
used
for
many
years
you
are
to
be
carried
in
it
to
the
levee
and
there
i
have
a
boat
for
overwhelmed
by
this
kindness
i
could
not
find
words
to
thank
him
as
i
got
into
the
chair
my
legs
were
too
long
for
it
i
remember
i
had
a
quaint
feeling
of
unreality
as
i
sank
back
on
the
red
satin
cushions
and
was
borne
out
of
the
gate
between
the
lions
monsieur
de
gré
and
nick
walked
in
front
the
faithful
lindy
followed
and
people
paused
to
stare
at
us
as
we
passed
we
crossed
the
place
d
armes
the
royal
road
gained
the
promenade
on
the
levee
s
crown
and
a
wide
barge
was
waiting
manned
by
six
negro
oarsmen
they
lifted
me
into
its
stern
under
the
awning
the
barge
was
cast
off
the
oars
dipped
and
we
were
gliding
silently
past
the
line
of
keel
boats
on
the
swift
current
of
the
mississippi
the
spars
of
the
shipping
were
inky
black
and
the
setting
sun
had
struck
a
red
band
across
the
waters
for
a
while
the
three
of
us
sat
gazing
at
the
green
shore
each
wrapped
in
his
own
reflections
philippe
de
gré
thinking
perchance
of
the
wayward
son
he
had
lost
nick
of
the
woman
who
awaited
him
and
i
of
one
whom
fate
had
set
beyond
me
it
was
monsieur
de
gré
who
broke
the
silence
at
last
you
feel
no
ill
effects
from
your
moving
david
he
asked
with
an
anxious
glance
at
me
none
sir
i
said
the
country
air
will
do
you
good
he
said
kindly
and
madame
la
vicomtesse
will
put
him
on
a
diet
added
nick
rousing
himself
hélène
will
take
care
of
him
answered
monsieur
de
gré
he
fell
to
musing
again
madame
la
vicomtesse
has
seen
more
in
seven
years
than
most
of
us
see
in
a
lifetime
he
said
she
has
beheld
the
glory
of
france
and
the
dishonor
and
pollution
of
her
country
had
the
old
order
lasted
her
salon
would
have
been
famous
and
she
would
have
been
a
power
in
i
have
thought
that
the
vicomtesse
must
have
had
a
queer
marriage
nick
remarked
monsieur
de
gré
smiled
such
marriages
were
the
rule
amongst
our
nobility
he
said
it
was
arranged
while
hélène
was
still
in
the
convent
though
it
was
not
celebrated
until
three
years
after
she
had
been
in
the
world
there
was
a
romantic
affair
i
believe
with
a
young
gentleman
of
the
english
embassy
though
i
do
not
know
the
details
he
is
said
to
be
the
only
man
she
ever
cared
for
he
was
a
younger
son
of
an
impoverished
i
started
remembering
what
the
vicomtesse
had
said
but
monsieur
de
gré
did
not
appear
to
see
my
perturbation
be
that
as
it
may
if
hélène
suffered
she
never
gave
a
sign
of
it
the
marriage
was
celebrated
with
great
pomp
and
the
world
could
only
conjecture
what
she
thought
of
the
vicomte
it
was
deemed
on
both
sides
a
brilliant
match
he
had
inherited
vast
estates
montméry
les
saillantes
i
know
not
what
else
she
was
heiress
to
the
château
de
gré
with
its
wide
lands
to
the
château
and
lands
of
the
côte
rouge
in
normandy
to
the
hotel
gré
in
paris
monsieur
le
vicomte
was
between
forty
and
fifty
at
his
marriage
and
from
what
i
have
heard
of
him
he
had
many
of
the
virtues
and
many
of
the
faults
of
his
order
he
was
a
bachelor
which
does
not
mean
that
he
had
lacked
consolations
he
was
reserved
with
his
equals
and
distant
with
others
he
had
served
in
the
guards
and
did
not
lack
courage
he
dressed
exquisitely
was
inclined
to
the
polignac
party
took
his
ease
everywhere
had
a
knowledge
of
cards
and
courts
and
little
else
he
was
cheated
by
his
stewards
refused
to
believe
that
the
revolution
was
serious
and
would
undoubtedly
have
been
guillotined
had
the
vicomtesse
not
contrived
to
get
him
out
of
france
in
spite
of
himself
they
went
first
to
the
duke
de
ligne
at
bel
oeil
and
thence
to
coblentz
he
accepted
a
commission
in
the
austrian
service
which
is
much
to
his
credit
and
hélène
went
with
some
friends
to
england
there
my
letter
reached
her
and
rather
than
be
beholden
to
strangers
or
accept
my
money
there
she
came
to
us
that
is
her
story
in
brief
messieurs
as
for
monsieur
le
vicomte
he
admired
his
wife
as
well
he
might
respected
her
for
the
way
she
served
the
gallants
but
he
made
no
pretence
of
loving
her
one
affair
a
girl
in
the
village
of
montméry
had
lasted
hélène
was
destined
for
higher
things
than
may
be
found
in
louisiana
said
monsieur
de
gré
turning
to
nick
but
now
that
you
are
to
carry
away
my
treasure
monsieur
i
do
not
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
and
has
there
been
any
news
of
the
vicomte
of
late
it
was
nick
who
asked
the
question
after
a
little
monsieur
de
gré
looked
at
him
in
surprise
eh
mon
dieu
have
you
not
heard
he
said
c
est
vrai
you
have
been
with
david
did
not
the
vicomtesse
mention
it
but
why
should
she
monsieur
le
vicomte
died
in
vienna
he
had
lived
too
the
vicomte
is
dead
i
said
they
both
looked
at
me
indeed
i
should
not
have
recognized
my
own
voice
what
my
face
betrayed
what
my
feelings
were
i
can
not
say
my
heart
beat
no
faster
there
was
no
tumult
in
my
brain
and
yet
my
breath
caught
strangely
something
grew
within
me
which
is
beyond
the
measure
of
speech
and
so
it
was
meant
to
be
i
did
not
know
this
myself
until
hélène
returned
to
les
îles
monsieur
de
gré
was
saying
to
me
the
letter
came
to
her
the
day
after
you
were
taken
ill
it
was
from
the
baron
von
seckenbrück
at
whose
house
the
vicomte
died
she
took
it
very
calmly
for
hélène
is
not
a
woman
to
pretend
how
much
better
after
all
if
she
had
married
her
englishman
for
love
and
she
is
much
troubled
now
because
as
she
declares
she
is
dependent
upon
my
bounty
that
is
my
happiness
my
consolation
the
good
man
added
simply
and
her
father
the
marquis
was
kind
to
me
when
i
was
a
young
provincial
and
a
stranger
god
rest
his
soul
we
were
drawing
near
to
les
îles
the
rains
had
come
during
my
illness
and
in
the
level
evening
light
the
forest
of
the
shore
was
the
tender
green
of
spring
at
length
we
saw
the
white
wooden
steps
in
the
levee
at
the
landing
and
near
them
were
three
figures
waiting
we
glided
nearer
one
was
madame
de
gré
another
was
antoinette
these
i
saw
indeed
the
other
was
hélène
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
eyes
met
mine
across
the
waters
and
drew
them
then
we
were
at
the
landing
i
heard
madame
de
gré
s
voice
and
antoinette
s
in
welcome
i
listened
for
another
i
saw
nick
running
up
the
steps
in
the
impetuosity
of
his
love
he
had
seized
antoinette
s
hand
in
his
and
she
was
the
color
of
a
red
rose
creole
decorum
forbade
further
advances
andré
and
another
lifted
me
out
and
they
gathered
around
me
these
kind
people
and
devoted
friends
antoinette
calling
me
with
exquisite
shyness
by
name
madame
de
gré
giving
me
a
grave
but
gentle
welcome
and
asking
anxiously
how
i
stood
the
journey
another
took
my
hand
held
it
for
the
briefest
space
that
has
been
marked
out
of
time
and
for
that
instant
i
looked
into
her
eyes
life
flowed
back
into
me
and
strength
and
a
joy
not
to
be
fathomed
i
could
have
walked
but
they
bore
me
through
the
vista
and
the
white
gallery
at
the
end
of
it
was
like
the
sight
of
home
the
evening
air
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
the
sweetest
of
all
shrubs
and
flowers
chapter
xiv
to
unpathed
waters
undreamed
shores
monsieur
and
madame
de
gré
themselves
came
with
me
to
my
chamber
off
the
gallery
where
everything
was
prepared
for
my
arrival
with
the
most
loving
care
monsieur
de
gré
supplying
many
things
from
his
wardrobe
which
i
lacked
and
when
i
tried
to
thank
them
for
their
kindness
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
tenez
mon
ami
he
said
you
got
your
illness
by
doing
things
for
other
people
it
is
time
other
people
did
something
for
lindy
brought
me
the
daintiest
of
suppers
and
i
was
left
to
my
meditations
nick
looked
in
at
the
door
and
hinted
darkly
that
i
had
to
thank
a
certain
tyrant
for
my
abandonment
i
called
to
him
but
he
paid
no
heed
and
i
heard
him
chuckling
as
he
retreated
along
the
gallery
the
journey
the
excitement
into
which
i
had
been
plunged
by
the
news
i
had
heard
brought
on
a
languor
and
i
was
between
sleeping
and
waking
half
the
night
i
slept
to
dream
of
her
of
the
vicomte
her
husband
walking
in
his
park
or
playing
cards
amidst
a
brilliant
company
in
a
great
room
like
the
at
temple
bow
doubt
grew
and
sleep
left
me
she
was
free
now
indeed
but
was
she
any
nearer
to
me
hope
grew
again
why
had
she
left
me
in
new
orleans
she
had
received
a
letter
and
if
she
had
cared
she
would
not
have
remained
but
there
was
a
detestable
argument
to
fit
that
likewise
and
in
the
light
of
this
argument
it
was
most
natural
that
she
should
return
to
les
îles
and
who
was
i
david
ritchie
a
lawyer
of
the
little
town
of
louisville
to
aspire
to
the
love
of
such
a
creature
was
it
likely
that
hélène
vicomtesse
d
would
think
twice
of
me
the
powers
of
the
world
were
making
ready
to
crush
the
presumptuous
france
of
the
jacobins
and
the
france
of
king
and
aristocracy
would
be
restored
châteaux
and
lands
would
be
hers
again
and
she
would
go
back
again
to
that
brilliant
life
among
the
great
to
which
she
was
born
for
which
nature
had
fitted
her
last
of
all
was
the
thought
of
the
englishman
whom
i
resembled
she
would
go
back
to
him
nick
was
the
first
in
my
room
the
next
morning
he
had
risen
early
so
he
ingenuously
informed
me
because
antoinette
had
a
habit
of
getting
up
with
the
birds
and
as
i
drank
my
coffee
he
was
emphatic
in
his
denunciations
of
the
customs
of
the
country
it
is
a
wonderful
day
davy
he
cried
you
must
hurry
and
get
out
monsieur
de
gré
sends
his
compliments
and
wishes
to
know
if
you
will
pardon
his
absence
this
morning
he
is
going
to
escort
antoinette
and
me
over
to
see
some
of
my
prospective
cousins
the
he
made
a
face
and
bent
nearer
to
my
ear
i
swear
to
you
i
have
not
had
one
moment
alone
with
her
we
have
been
for
a
walk
but
madame
la
vicomtesse
must
needs
intrude
herself
upon
us
egad
i
told
her
plainly
what
i
thought
of
her
and
what
did
she
say
i
asked
trying
to
smile
she
laughed
and
said
that
i
belonged
to
a
young
nation
which
had
done
much
harm
in
the
world
to
everybody
but
themselves
faith
if
i
wasn
t
in
love
with
antoinette
i
believe
i
d
be
in
love
with
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
i
answered
the
vicomtesse
is
as
handsome
as
a
queen
this
morning
he
continued
paying
no
heed
to
this
remark
she
has
on
a
linen
dress
that
puzzles
me
it
was
made
to
walk
among
the
trees
and
flowers
it
is
as
simple
as
you
please
and
yet
it
has
a
distinction
that
makes
you
you
seem
to
have
stared
i
answered
since
when
did
you
take
such
interest
in
gowns
bless
you
it
was
antoinette
i
never
should
have
known
said
he
antoinette
had
never
before
seen
the
gown
and
she
asked
the
vicomtesse
where
she
got
the
pattern
the
vicomtesse
said
that
the
gown
had
been
made
by
léonard
a
court
dressmaker
and
it
was
of
the
fashion
the
queen
had
set
to
wear
in
the
gardens
of
the
trianon
when
simplicity
became
the
craze
antoinette
is
to
have
it
copied
so
she
which
proved
that
antoinette
was
human
after
all
and
happy
once
more
hang
it
said
nick
she
paid
more
attention
to
that
gown
than
to
me
davy
obey
the
the
is
is
not
the
vicomtesse
going
with
you
i
asked
no
i
m
sorry
for
you
he
called
back
from
the
gallery
he
had
need
to
be
for
i
fell
into
as
great
a
fright
as
ever
i
had
had
in
my
life
monsieur
de
gré
knocked
at
the
door
and
startled
me
out
of
my
wits
hearing
that
i
was
awake
he
had
come
in
person
to
make
his
excuses
for
leaving
me
that
morning
bon
dieu
he
said
looking
at
me
the
country
has
done
you
good
already
behold
a
marvel
au
revoir
i
heard
the
horses
being
brought
around
and
laughter
and
voices
how
easily
i
distinguished
hers
then
i
heard
the
on
the
soft
dirt
of
the
drive
then
silence
the
silence
of
a
summer
morning
which
is
all
myriad
sweet
sounds
then
lindy
appeared
starched
and
turbaned
marse
dave
how
you
feel
dis
mawnin
yo
pears
mighty
peart
sholy
marse
dave
yo
chair
is
sot
on
de
gallery
is
you
ready
i
ll
fotch
dat
yaller
nigger
you
needn
t
fetch
andré
i
said
i
can
lan
sakes
marse
dave
but
you
is
i
rose
and
walked
out
on
the
gallery
with
surprising
steadiness
a
great
cushioned
chair
had
been
placed
there
and
beside
it
a
table
with
books
and
another
chair
i
sat
down
lindy
looked
at
me
sharply
but
i
did
not
heed
her
and
presently
she
retired
the
day
still
in
its
early
golden
glory
seemed
big
with
prescience
above
the
saffron
haze
was
lifted
and
there
was
the
blue
sky
the
breeze
held
its
breath
the
fragrance
of
grass
and
fruit
and
flowers
of
the
shrub
that
vied
with
all
languished
on
the
air
out
of
these
things
she
came
i
knew
that
she
was
coming
but
i
saw
her
first
at
the
gallery
s
end
the
roses
she
held
red
against
the
white
linen
of
her
gown
then
i
felt
a
great
yearning
and
a
great
dread
i
have
seen
many
of
her
kind
since
and
none
reflected
so
truly
as
she
the
life
of
the
old
régime
her
dress
her
carriage
her
air
all
suggested
it
and
she
might
as
nick
said
have
been
walking
in
the
gardens
of
the
trianon
titles
i
cared
nothing
for
hers
alone
seemed
real
to
put
her
far
above
me
had
all
who
bore
them
been
as
worthy
titles
would
have
meant
much
to
mankind
she
was
coming
swiftly
i
rose
to
my
feet
before
her
i
believe
i
should
have
risen
in
death
and
then
she
was
standing
beside
me
looking
up
into
my
face
you
must
not
do
that
she
said
or
i
will
go
i
sat
down
again
she
went
to
the
door
and
called
i
following
her
with
my
eyes
lindy
came
with
a
bowl
of
water
put
it
on
the
table
said
the
vicomtesse
lindy
put
the
bowl
on
the
table
gave
us
a
glance
and
departed
silently
the
vicomtesse
began
to
arrange
the
flowers
in
the
bowl
and
i
watched
her
fascinated
by
her
movements
she
did
everything
quickly
deftly
but
this
matter
took
an
unconscionable
time
she
did
not
so
much
as
glance
at
me
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
my
presence
there
she
said
at
last
giving
them
a
final
touch
you
are
less
talkative
if
anything
than
usual
this
morning
ritchie
you
have
not
said
good
morning
you
have
not
told
me
how
you
were
you
have
not
even
thanked
me
for
the
roses
one
might
almost
believe
that
you
are
sorry
to
come
to
les
one
might
believe
anything
who
didn
t
know
madame
la
she
put
her
hand
to
the
flowers
again
it
seems
a
pity
to
pick
them
even
in
a
good
cause
she
said
she
was
so
near
me
that
i
could
have
touched
her
a
weakness
seized
me
and
speech
was
farther
away
than
ever
she
moved
she
sat
down
and
looked
at
me
and
the
kind
of
mocking
smile
came
into
her
eyes
that
i
knew
was
the
forerunner
of
raillery
there
is
a
statue
in
the
gardens
of
versailles
which
seems
always
about
to
speak
and
then
to
think
better
of
it
you
remind
me
of
that
statue
ritchie
it
is
the
statue
of
what
did
she
mean
wisdom
knows
the
limitations
of
its
own
worth
madame
i
replied
it
is
the
one
particular
in
which
i
should
have
thought
wisdom
was
lacking
she
said
you
have
a
tongue
if
you
will
deign
to
use
it
or
shall
i
read
to
you
she
added
quickly
picking
up
a
book
i
have
read
to
the
queen
when
madame
campan
was
tired
her
majesty
poor
dear
lady
did
me
the
honor
to
say
she
liked
my
you
have
done
everything
madame
i
said
i
have
read
to
a
queen
to
a
king
s
sister
but
never
yet
to
a
king
she
said
opening
the
book
and
giving
me
the
briefest
of
glances
you
are
all
kings
in
america
are
you
not
what
shall
i
read
i
would
rather
have
you
talk
to
very
well
i
will
tell
you
how
the
queen
spoke
english
no
i
will
not
do
that
she
said
a
swift
expression
of
sadness
passing
over
her
face
i
will
never
mock
her
again
she
was
a
good
sovereign
and
a
brave
woman
and
i
loved
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
i
thought
there
was
a
great
weariness
in
her
voice
when
she
spoke
again
i
have
every
reason
to
thank
god
when
i
think
of
the
terrors
i
escaped
of
the
friends
i
have
found
and
yet
i
am
an
unhappy
woman
you
are
unhappy
when
you
are
not
doing
things
for
others
madame
i
suggested
i
am
a
discontented
woman
she
said
i
always
have
been
and
i
am
unhappy
when
i
think
of
all
those
who
were
dear
to
me
and
whom
i
loved
many
are
dead
and
many
are
scattered
and
i
have
often
thought
of
your
sorrows
madame
i
said
which
reminds
me
that
i
should
not
burden
you
with
them
my
good
friend
when
you
are
recovering
do
you
know
that
you
have
been
very
near
to
death
i
know
madame
i
faltered
i
know
that
had
it
not
been
for
you
i
should
not
be
alive
i
know
that
you
risked
your
life
to
save
my
she
did
not
answer
at
once
and
when
i
looked
at
her
she
was
gazing
out
over
the
flowers
on
the
lawn
my
life
did
not
matter
she
said
let
us
not
talk
of
i
might
have
answered
but
i
dared
not
speak
for
fear
of
saying
what
was
in
my
heart
and
while
i
trembled
with
the
repression
of
it
she
was
changed
she
turned
her
face
towards
me
and
smiled
a
little
if
you
had
obeyed
me
you
would
not
have
been
so
ill
she
said
then
i
am
glad
that
i
did
not
obey
your
cousin
the
irrepressible
temple
says
i
am
a
tyrant
come
now
do
you
think
me
a
tyrant
he
has
also
said
other
things
of
what
other
things
i
blushed
at
my
own
boldness
he
said
that
if
he
were
not
in
love
with
antoinette
he
would
be
in
love
with
a
very
safe
compliment
said
the
vicomtesse
indeed
it
sounds
too
cautious
for
temple
you
must
have
tampered
with
it
ritchie
she
flashed
mr
temple
is
a
boy
he
needs
discipline
he
will
have
too
easy
a
time
with
he
is
not
the
sort
of
man
you
should
marry
i
said
and
sat
amazed
at
it
she
looked
at
me
strangely
no
he
is
not
she
answered
he
is
more
or
less
the
sort
of
man
i
have
been
thrown
with
all
my
life
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
i
know
you
will
not
misunderstand
me
for
i
am
very
fond
of
him
temple
is
honest
fearless
lovable
and
of
good
instincts
one
can
not
say
as
much
for
the
rest
of
his
type
they
go
through
life
fighting
gaming
riding
to
hounds
i
have
often
thought
that
it
was
no
wonder
our
privileges
came
to
an
end
so
many
of
us
were
steeped
in
selfishness
and
vice
were
a
burden
on
the
world
the
early
nobles
with
all
their
crimes
were
men
who
carved
their
way
of
such
were
the
lords
of
the
marches
we
toyed
with
politics
with
simplicity
we
wasted
the
land
we
played
cards
as
our
coaches
passed
through
villages
the
reckoning
came
our
punishment
was
not
given
into
the
hands
of
the
bourgeois
who
would
have
dealt
justly
but
to
the
scum
the
canaille
the
demons
of
the
earth
had
our
king
had
our
nobility
been
men
with
the
old
fire
they
would
not
have
stood
it
they
were
worn
out
with
centuries
of
catering
to
themselves
give
me
a
man
who
will
shape
his
life
and
live
it
with
all
his
strength
i
am
tired
of
sham
and
pretence
of
cynical
wit
of
mocking
at
the
real
things
of
life
of
pride
and
hypocrisy
give
me
a
man
whose
existence
means
was
she
thinking
of
the
englishman
of
whom
she
had
spoken
delicacy
forbade
my
asking
the
question
he
had
been
a
man
according
to
her
own
testimony
where
was
he
now
her
voice
had
a
ring
of
earnestness
in
it
i
had
never
heard
before
and
this
arraignment
of
her
own
life
and
of
her
old
friends
surprised
me
now
she
seemed
lost
in
a
revery
from
which
i
forebore
to
arouse
her
i
have
often
tried
to
picture
your
life
i
said
at
last
you
she
answered
turning
her
head
quickly
often
ever
since
i
first
saw
the
miniature
i
said
monsieur
de
gré
told
me
some
things
and
afterwards
i
read
le
mariage
de
figaro
and
some
novels
and
some
memoirs
of
the
old
courts
which
i
got
in
philadelphia
last
winter
i
used
to
think
of
you
as
i
rode
over
the
mountains
as
i
sat
reading
in
my
room
of
an
evening
i
used
to
picture
you
in
the
palaces
amusing
the
queen
and
making
the
cardinals
laugh
and
then
i
used
to
wonder
what
became
of
you
and
whether
i
hesitated
overwhelmed
by
a
sudden
confusion
for
she
was
gazing
at
me
fixedly
with
a
look
i
did
not
understand
you
used
to
think
of
that
she
said
i
never
thought
to
see
you
i
answered
laughter
came
into
her
eyes
and
i
knew
that
i
had
not
vexed
her
but
i
had
spoken
stupidly
and
i
reddened
i
had
a
quick
tongue
she
said
as
though
to
cover
my
confusion
i
have
it
yet
in
those
days
misfortune
had
not
curbed
it
i
had
not
learned
to
be
charitable
when
i
was
a
child
i
used
to
ride
with
my
father
to
the
hunts
at
gré
and
i
was
too
ready
to
pick
out
the
weaknesses
of
his
guests
if
one
of
the
company
had
a
trick
or
a
mannerism
i
never
failed
to
catch
it
people
used
to
ask
me
what
i
thought
of
such
and
such
a
person
and
that
was
bad
for
me
i
saw
their
failings
and
pretensions
but
i
ignored
my
own
it
was
the
same
at
abbaye
aux
bois
the
convent
where
i
was
taught
when
i
was
presented
to
her
majesty
i
saw
why
people
hated
her
they
did
not
understand
her
she
was
a
woman
with
a
large
heart
with
charity
some
did
not
suspect
this
others
forgot
it
because
they
beheld
a
brilliant
personage
with
keen
perceptions
who
would
not
submit
to
being
bored
her
majesty
made
many
enemies
at
court
of
persons
who
believed
she
was
making
fun
of
them
there
was
a
at
the
french
court
called
mademoiselle
bertin
who
became
ridiculously
pretentious
because
the
queen
allowed
the
woman
to
dress
her
hair
in
private
bertin
used
to
put
on
airs
with
the
nobility
when
they
came
to
order
gowns
and
she
was
very
rude
to
me
when
i
went
for
my
court
dress
there
was
a
ball
at
versailles
the
day
i
was
presented
and
my
father
told
me
that
her
majesty
wished
to
speak
with
me
i
was
very
much
frightened
the
queen
was
standing
with
her
back
to
the
mirror
the
duchesse
de
polignac
and
some
other
ladies
beside
her
when
my
father
brought
me
up
and
her
majesty
was
smiling
what
did
you
say
to
bertin
mademoiselle
she
asked
i
was
more
frightened
than
ever
but
the
remembrance
of
the
woman
s
impudence
got
the
better
of
me
i
told
her
that
in
dressing
your
majesty
s
hair
she
had
acquired
all
the
court
accomplishments
but
i
ll
warrant
that
bertin
was
curious
said
the
queen
she
was
your
what
is
the
accomplishment
she
lacks
the
queen
demanded
i
should
like
to
know
it
it
is
discrimination
your
majesty
i
told
the
woman
there
were
some
people
she
could
be
rude
to
with
impunity
i
was
not
one
of
she
ll
never
be
rude
to
you
again
mademoiselle
said
the
queen
i
am
sure
of
it
your
majesty
i
said
the
queen
laughed
and
bade
the
duchesse
de
polignac
invite
me
to
supper
that
evening
my
father
was
delighted
i
was
more
frightened
than
ever
but
the
party
was
small
her
majesty
was
very
gracious
and
spoke
to
me
often
and
i
saw
that
above
all
things
she
liked
to
be
amused
poor
lady
it
was
a
year
after
that
terrible
affair
of
the
necklace
and
she
wished
to
be
distracted
from
thinking
of
the
calumnies
which
were
being
heaped
upon
her
she
used
to
send
for
me
often
during
the
years
that
followed
and
i
might
have
had
a
place
at
court
near
her
person
but
my
father
was
sensible
enough
to
advise
me
not
to
accept
if
i
could
refuse
without
offending
her
majesty
the
queen
was
not
offended
she
was
good
enough
to
say
that
i
was
wise
in
my
request
she
had
indeed
abolished
most
of
the
ridiculous
etiquette
of
the
court
she
would
not
eat
in
public
she
would
not
be
followed
around
the
palace
by
ladies
in
court
gowns
she
would
not
have
her
ladies
in
the
room
when
she
was
dressing
if
she
wished
a
mirror
she
would
not
wait
for
it
to
be
passed
through
half
a
dozen
hands
and
handed
her
by
a
princess
of
the
blood
sometimes
she
used
to
summon
me
to
amuse
her
and
walk
with
me
by
the
water
in
the
beautiful
gardens
of
the
petit
trianon
i
used
to
imitate
the
people
she
disliked
i
disliked
them
too
i
have
seen
her
laugh
until
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
when
i
talked
of
monsieur
necker
as
the
dark
days
drew
nearer
i
loved
more
and
more
to
be
in
the
seclusion
of
the
country
at
montméry
at
the
gré
of
my
girlhood
i
can
see
gré
now
said
the
vicomtesse
the
thatched
houses
of
the
little
village
on
either
side
of
the
the
honest
peasants
courtesying
in
their
doorways
at
our
berline
the
brick
wall
of
the
park
the
iron
gates
beside
the
lodge
the
long
avenue
of
poplars
the
deer
feeding
in
the
beechwood
the
bridge
over
the
shining
stream
and
the
long
château
beyond
it
paris
and
the
muttering
of
the
storm
were
far
away
the
mornings
on
the
sunny
terrace
looking
across
the
valley
to
the
blue
hills
the
walks
in
the
village
grew
very
dear
to
me
we
do
not
know
the
value
of
things
ritchie
until
we
are
about
to
lose
you
did
not
go
back
to
court
i
asked
she
sighed
yes
i
went
back
i
thought
it
my
duty
i
was
at
versailles
that
terrible
summer
when
the
states
general
met
when
the
national
assembly
grew
out
of
it
when
the
bastille
was
stormed
when
the
king
was
throwing
away
his
prerogatives
like
confetti
never
did
the
gardens
of
the
trianon
seem
more
beautiful
or
more
sad
sometimes
the
queen
would
laugh
even
then
when
i
mimicked
bailly
des
moulins
mirabeau
i
was
with
her
majesty
in
the
gardens
on
that
dark
rainy
day
when
the
fishwomen
came
to
versailles
the
memory
of
that
night
will
haunt
me
as
long
as
i
live
the
wind
howled
the
rain
lashed
with
fury
against
the
windows
the
mob
tore
through
the
streets
of
the
town
sacked
the
built
great
fires
at
the
corners
before
the
day
dawned
again
the
furies
had
broken
into
the
palace
and
murdered
what
was
left
of
the
guard
you
have
heard
how
they
carried
off
the
king
and
queen
to
paris
how
they
bore
the
heads
of
the
soldiers
on
their
pikes
i
saw
it
from
a
window
and
i
shall
never
forget
her
voice
faltered
and
there
were
tears
on
her
lashes
some
quality
in
her
narration
brought
before
me
so
vividly
the
scenes
of
which
she
spoke
that
i
started
when
she
had
finished
there
was
much
more
i
would
have
known
but
i
could
not
press
her
to
speak
longer
on
a
subject
that
gave
her
pain
at
that
moment
she
seemed
more
distant
to
me
than
ever
before
she
rose
went
into
the
house
and
left
me
thinking
of
the
presumptions
of
the
hopes
i
had
dared
to
entertain
left
me
picturing
sadly
the
existence
of
which
she
had
spoken
why
had
she
told
me
of
it
perchance
she
had
thought
to
do
me
a
kindness
she
came
back
to
me
i
had
not
thought
she
would
she
sat
down
with
her
embroidery
in
her
lap
and
for
some
moments
busied
herself
with
it
in
silence
then
she
said
without
looking
up
i
do
not
know
why
i
have
tired
you
with
this
why
i
have
saddened
myself
it
is
past
and
i
was
not
tired
madame
it
is
very
difficult
to
live
in
the
present
when
the
past
has
been
so
brilliant
i
answered
so
brilliant
she
sighed
so
thoughtless
i
think
that
is
the
sharpest
i
watched
her
fingers
as
they
stitched
wondering
how
they
could
work
so
rapidly
at
last
she
said
in
a
low
voice
antoinette
and
temple
have
told
me
something
of
your
life
i
laughed
it
has
been
very
humble
i
replied
what
i
heard
was
interesting
to
me
she
said
turning
over
her
frame
will
you
not
tell
me
something
of
it
gladly
madame
if
that
is
the
case
i
answered
well
then
she
said
why
don
t
you
i
do
not
know
which
part
you
would
like
madame
shall
i
tell
you
about
colonel
clark
i
do
not
know
when
to
begin
she
dropped
her
sewing
in
her
lap
and
looked
up
at
me
quickly
i
told
you
that
you
were
a
strange
man
she
said
i
almost
lose
patience
with
you
no
don
t
tell
me
about
colonel
clark
at
least
not
until
you
come
to
him
begin
at
the
beginning
at
the
cabin
in
the
you
want
the
whole
of
it
i
exclaimed
she
picked
up
her
embroidery
again
and
bent
over
it
with
a
smile
yes
i
want
the
whole
of
so
i
began
at
the
cabin
in
the
mountains
i
can
not
say
that
i
ever
forgot
she
was
listening
but
i
lost
myself
in
the
narrative
it
presented
to
me
for
the
first
time
many
aspects
that
i
had
not
thought
of
for
instance
that
i
should
be
here
now
in
louisiana
telling
it
to
one
who
had
been
the
companion
and
friend
of
the
queen
of
france
once
in
a
while
the
vicomtesse
would
look
up
at
me
swiftly
when
i
paused
and
then
go
on
with
her
work
again
i
told
her
of
temple
bow
and
how
i
had
run
away
of
polly
ann
and
tom
of
the
wilderness
trail
and
how
i
shot
cutcheon
of
the
fight
at
crab
orchard
of
the
life
in
kentucky
of
clark
and
his
campaign
of
my
doings
since
how
i
had
found
nick
and
how
he
had
come
to
new
orleans
with
me
of
my
life
as
a
lawyer
in
louisville
of
the
conventions
i
had
been
to
the
morning
wore
on
to
midday
and
i
told
her
more
than
i
believed
it
possible
to
tell
any
one
when
at
last
i
had
finished
a
fear
grew
upon
me
that
i
had
told
her
too
much
her
fingers
still
stitched
her
head
was
bent
and
i
could
not
see
her
face
only
the
knot
of
her
hair
coiled
with
an
art
that
struck
me
suddenly
then
she
spoke
and
her
voice
was
very
low
i
love
polly
ann
she
said
i
should
like
to
know
i
wish
that
you
could
know
her
i
answered
quickening
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
at
me
with
an
expression
that
was
not
a
smile
i
could
not
say
what
it
was
or
what
it
meant
i
do
not
think
you
are
stupid
she
said
in
the
same
tone
but
i
do
not
believe
you
know
how
remarkable
your
life
has
been
i
can
scarcely
realize
that
you
have
seen
all
this
have
done
all
this
have
felt
all
this
you
are
a
lawyer
a
man
of
affairs
and
yet
you
could
guide
me
over
the
hidden
paths
of
half
a
continent
you
know
the
mountain
ranges
the
passes
the
rivers
the
fords
the
forest
trails
the
towns
and
the
men
who
made
them
she
picked
up
her
sewing
and
bent
over
it
once
more
and
yet
you
did
not
think
that
this
would
interest
perchance
it
was
a
subtle
summons
in
her
voice
i
heard
that
bade
me
open
the
of
my
heart
i
know
not
i
know
only
that
no
power
on
earth
could
have
held
me
silent
then
hélène
i
said
and
stopped
my
heart
beat
so
wildly
that
i
could
hear
it
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
dare
to
think
of
you
to
look
up
to
you
hélène
i
love
you
i
shall
love
you
till
i
die
i
love
you
with
all
the
strength
that
is
in
me
with
all
my
soul
you
know
it
and
if
you
did
not
i
could
hide
it
no
more
as
long
as
i
live
there
will
never
be
another
woman
in
the
world
for
me
i
love
you
you
will
forgive
me
because
of
the
torture
i
have
suffered
because
of
the
pain
i
shall
suffer
when
i
think
of
you
in
the
years
to
her
sewing
dropped
to
her
lap
to
the
floor
she
looked
at
me
and
the
light
which
i
saw
in
her
eyes
flooded
my
soul
with
a
joy
beyond
my
belief
i
trembled
with
a
wonder
that
benumbed
me
i
would
have
got
to
my
feet
had
she
not
come
to
me
swiftly
that
i
might
not
rise
she
stood
above
me
i
lifted
up
my
arms
she
bent
to
me
with
a
movement
that
conferred
a
priceless
thing
david
she
said
could
you
not
tell
that
i
loved
you
that
you
were
he
who
has
been
in
my
mind
for
so
many
years
and
in
my
heart
since
i
saw
you
i
could
not
tell
i
said
i
dared
not
think
it
i
i
thought
there
was
she
was
seated
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
she
drew
back
her
head
with
a
smile
trembling
on
her
lips
with
a
lustre
burning
in
her
eyes
like
a
vigil
a
vigil
for
me
he
reminded
me
of
you
she
answered
i
was
lost
in
sheer
bewildering
happiness
and
she
who
created
it
who
herself
was
that
happiness
roused
me
from
it
what
are
you
thinking
she
asked
i
was
thinking
that
a
star
has
fallen
that
i
may
have
a
jewel
beyond
other
men
i
said
and
a
star
has
risen
for
me
she
said
that
i
may
have
a
guide
beyond
other
then
it
is
you
who
have
raised
it
i
was
silent
a
moment
trying
again
to
bring
the
matter
within
my
grasp
do
you
mean
that
you
love
me
that
you
will
marry
me
that
you
will
come
back
to
kentucky
with
me
and
will
be
content
you
who
have
been
the
companion
of
a
queen
there
came
an
archness
into
her
look
that
inflamed
me
the
more
i
who
have
been
the
companion
of
a
queen
love
you
will
marry
you
will
go
back
to
kentucky
with
you
and
be
content
she
repeated
and
yet
not
i
david
but
another
woman
a
happy
woman
you
shall
be
my
refuge
my
strength
my
guide
you
will
lead
me
over
the
mountains
and
through
the
wilderness
by
the
paths
you
know
you
will
bring
me
to
polly
ann
that
i
may
thank
her
for
the
gift
of
you
above
all
other
gifts
in
the
i
was
silent
again
hélène
i
said
at
last
will
you
give
me
the
miniature
on
one
condition
she
replied
yes
i
said
yes
and
again
yes
what
is
it
that
you
will
obey
me
it
is
a
privilege
i
long
for
i
answered
you
did
not
begin
with
promise
she
said
i
released
her
hand
and
she
drew
the
ivory
from
her
gown
and
gave
it
me
i
kissed
it
i
will
go
to
monsieur
isadore
s
and
get
the
frame
i
said
when
i
give
you
permission
said
hélène
gently
i
have
written
this
story
for
her
eyes
chapter
xv
an
episode
in
the
life
of
a
man
out
of
the
blood
and
ashes
of
france
a
man
had
arisen
who
moved
real
kings
and
queens
on
his
which
was
a
large
part
of
the
world
the
man
was
napoleon
buonaparte
at
present
for
lack
of
a
better
name
first
consul
of
the
french
republic
the
man
s
eye
sweeping
the
world
for
a
new
plaything
had
rested
upon
one
which
had
excited
the
fancy
of
lesser
adventurers
of
one
john
law
for
instance
it
was
a
large
unwieldy
plaything
indeed
and
remote
it
was
nothing
less
than
that
vast
and
mysterious
country
which
lay
beyond
the
monster
yellow
river
of
the
wilderness
the
country
bordered
on
the
south
by
the
gulf
swamps
on
the
north
by
no
man
knew
what
forests
as
dark
as
those
the
romans
found
in
gaul
on
the
west
by
a
line
which
other
generations
might
be
left
to
settle
this
land
was
louisiana
a
future
king
of
france
while
an
émigré
had
been
to
louisiana
this
is
merely
an
interesting
fact
worth
noting
it
was
not
interesting
to
napoleon
napoleon
by
dint
of
certain
screws
which
he
tightened
on
his
catholic
majesty
king
charles
of
spain
in
the
treaty
of
san
ildefonso
on
the
of
october
got
his
plaything
louisiana
was
french
again
whatever
french
was
in
those
days
the
treaty
was
a
profound
secret
but
secrets
leak
out
even
the
profoundest
and
this
was
wafted
across
the
english
channel
to
the
ears
of
rufus
king
american
minister
at
london
who
wrote
of
it
to
one
thomas
jefferson
president
of
the
united
states
jefferson
was
interested
not
to
say
alarmed
robert
livingston
was
about
to
depart
on
his
mission
from
the
little
republic
of
america
to
the
great
republic
of
france
livingston
was
told
not
to
make
himself
disagreeable
but
to
protest
if
spain
was
to
give
up
the
plaything
the
youngest
child
among
the
nations
ought
to
have
it
it
lay
at
her
doors
it
was
necessary
for
her
growth
livingston
arrived
in
france
to
find
that
louisiana
was
a
mere
pawn
on
the
the
republic
he
represented
little
more
he
protested
and
the
great
talleyrand
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
was
monsieur
talking
about
a
treaty
what
treaty
a
treaty
with
spain
ceding
back
louisiana
to
france
after
forty
years
who
said
there
was
such
a
treaty
did
monsieur
take
snuff
would
monsieur
call
again
when
the
minister
was
less
busy
monsieur
did
call
again
taking
care
not
to
make
himself
disagreeable
he
was
offered
snuff
he
called
again
pleasantly
he
was
offered
snuff
he
called
again
the
great
talleyrand
laughed
he
was
always
so
happy
to
see
monsieur
when
he
talleyrand
was
not
busy
he
would
give
monsieur
a
certificate
of
importunity
he
had
quite
forgotten
what
monsieur
was
talking
about
on
former
occasions
oh
yes
a
treaty
well
suppose
there
was
such
a
treaty
what
then
what
then
livingston
the
agreeable
but
importunate
went
home
and
wrote
a
memorial
and
was
presently
assured
that
the
inaccessible
man
who
was
called
first
consul
had
read
it
with
interest
great
interest
livingston
did
not
cease
to
indulge
in
his
enjoyable
visits
to
talleyrand
not
he
but
in
the
intervals
he
sat
down
to
think
what
did
the
inaccessible
man
himself
have
in
his
mind
the
man
had
been
considering
the
race
and
in
particular
that
portion
of
it
which
inhabited
the
western
hemisphere
he
perceived
that
they
were
a
quarrelsome
people
which
possessed
the
lust
for
land
and
conquest
like
the
rest
of
their
blood
he
saw
with
astonishment
something
that
had
happened
something
that
they
had
done
unperceived
by
the
world
in
five
and
twenty
years
they
had
swept
across
a
thousand
miles
of
mountain
and
forest
wilderness
in
ever
increasing
thousands
had
beaten
the
fiercest
of
savage
tribes
before
them
stolidly
unmindful
of
their
dead
they
had
come
at
length
to
the
great
yellow
river
and
finding
it
closed
had
cried
aloud
in
their
anger
what
was
beyond
it
to
stop
them
spain
with
a
handful
of
subjects
inherited
from
the
france
of
louis
the
fifteenth
could
spain
stop
them
no
but
he
the
man
would
stop
them
he
would
raise
up
in
louisiana
as
a
monument
to
himself
a
daughter
of
france
to
curb
their
ambition
america
should
not
be
all
already
the
americans
had
compelled
spain
to
open
the
river
how
long
before
they
would
overrun
louisiana
itself
until
a
frenchman
or
a
spaniard
could
scarce
be
found
in
the
land
sadly
in
accordance
with
the
treaty
which
monsieur
talleyrand
had
known
nothing
about
his
catholic
majesty
instructed
his
intendant
at
new
orleans
to
make
ready
to
deliver
louisiana
to
the
french
commission
that
was
in
july
this
was
not
exactly
an
order
to
close
the
river
again
in
fact
his
majesty
said
nothing
about
closing
the
river
mark
the
reasoning
of
the
spanish
mind
the
intendant
closed
the
river
as
his
plain
duty
and
kentucky
and
tennessee
wayward
belligerent
infants
who
had
outgrown
their
swaddling
clothes
were
heard
from
again
the
nation
had
learned
to
listen
to
them
the
nation
was
very
angry
hamilton
and
the
federalists
and
many
others
would
have
gone
to
war
and
seized
the
floridas
jefferson
said
wait
and
see
what
his
catholic
majesty
has
to
jefferson
was
a
man
of
great
wisdom
albeit
he
had
mistaken
jacobinism
for
something
else
when
he
was
younger
and
he
knew
that
napoleon
could
not
play
chess
in
the
wind
the
wind
was
rising
livingston
was
a
patriot
able
importunate
but
getting
on
in
years
and
a
little
hard
of
hearing
importunity
without
an
army
and
a
navy
behind
it
is
not
effective
especially
when
there
is
no
wind
but
jefferson
heard
the
wind
rising
and
he
sent
monroe
to
livingston
s
aid
monroe
was
young
witty
lively
popular
with
people
he
met
he
too
heard
the
wind
rising
and
so
now
did
livingston
the
ships
containing
the
advance
guard
of
the
colonists
destined
for
the
new
louisiana
lay
in
the
roads
at
dunkirk
their
anchors
ready
to
weigh
three
thousand
men
three
thousand
horses
for
the
man
did
things
on
a
large
scale
the
anchors
were
not
weighed
his
catholic
majesty
sent
word
from
spain
to
jefferson
that
he
was
sorry
his
intendant
had
been
so
foolish
the
river
was
opened
again
the
treaty
of
amiens
was
a
poor
it
blew
down
and
the
chessmen
began
to
totter
one
george
of
england
noted
for
his
frugal
table
and
his
quarrelsome
disposition
who
had
previously
fought
with
france
began
to
call
the
man
names
the
man
called
george
names
and
sat
down
to
think
quickly
george
could
not
be
said
to
be
on
the
best
of
terms
with
his
american
relations
but
the
is
unsentimental
phlegmatic
setting
money
and
trade
and
lands
above
ideals
george
meant
to
go
to
war
again
napoleon
also
meant
to
go
to
war
again
but
george
meant
to
go
to
war
again
right
away
which
was
inconvenient
and
inconsiderate
for
napoleon
had
not
finished
his
game
of
chess
the
obvious
outcome
of
the
situation
was
that
george
with
his
navy
would
get
louisiana
or
else
help
his
relations
to
get
it
in
either
case
louisiana
would
become
this
was
the
wind
which
jefferson
had
heard
the
man
being
a
genius
who
let
go
gracefully
when
he
had
to
decided
between
two
bad
bargains
he
would
sell
louisiana
to
the
americans
as
a
favor
they
would
be
very
very
grateful
and
they
would
go
on
hating
george
moreover
he
would
have
all
the
more
money
with
which
to
fight
george
the
inaccessible
man
suddenly
became
accessible
nay
he
became
gracious
smiling
full
of
charitable
certain
dickerings
followed
by
a
bargain
passed
between
the
american
minister
and
monsieur
then
livingston
and
monroe
dined
with
the
hitherto
inaccessible
and
the
man
after
the
manner
of
continental
personages
asked
questions
frederick
the
great
has
started
this
fashion
and
many
have
imitated
it
louisiana
became
american
at
last
whether
by
destiny
or
chance
whether
by
the
wisdom
of
jefferson
or
the
necessity
of
napoleon
who
can
say
it
seems
to
me
david
ritchie
writing
many
years
after
the
closing
words
of
the
last
chapter
were
penned
that
it
was
ours
inevitably
for
i
have
seen
and
known
and
loved
the
people
with
all
their
crudities
and
faults
whose
inheritance
it
was
by
right
of
toil
and
suffering
and
blood
and
i
david
ritchie
saw
the
flags
of
three
nations
waving
over
it
in
the
space
of
two
days
and
it
came
to
pass
in
this
wise
rumors
of
these
things
which
i
have
told
above
had
filled
kentucky
from
time
to
time
and
in
november
of
there
came
across
the
mountains
the
news
that
the
senate
of
the
united
states
had
ratified
the
treaty
between
our
ministers
and
napoleon
i
will
not
mention
here
what
my
life
had
become
what
my
fortune
save
to
say
that
both
had
been
far
beyond
my
expectations
in
worldly
goods
and
honors
in
the
respect
and
esteem
of
my
i
had
been
happy
indeed
but
i
had
been
blessed
above
other
men
by
one
whose
power
it
was
to
lift
me
above
the
mean
and
sordid
things
of
this
world
many
times
in
the
pursuit
of
my
affairs
i
journeyed
over
that
country
which
i
had
known
when
it
belonged
to
the
indian
and
the
deer
and
the
elk
and
the
wolf
and
the
buffalo
often
did
she
ride
by
my
side
making
light
of
the
hardships
which
indeed
were
no
hardships
to
her
wondering
at
the
settlements
which
had
sprung
up
like
magic
in
the
wilderness
which
were
the
heralds
of
the
greatness
of
the
republic
her
country
now
so
in
the
bright
and
boisterous
march
weather
of
the
year
we
found
ourselves
riding
together
along
the
way
made
memorable
by
the
footsteps
of
clark
and
his
backwoodsmen
for
i
had
an
errand
in
louis
with
colonel
chouteau
a
subtle
change
had
come
upon
kaskaskia
with
the
new
blood
which
was
flowing
into
it
we
passed
cahokia
full
of
memories
to
the
drummer
boy
whom
she
loved
there
was
the
church
the
garrison
the
stream
and
the
little
house
where
my
colonel
and
i
had
lived
together
she
must
see
them
all
she
must
hear
the
story
from
my
lips
again
and
the
telling
of
it
to
her
gave
it
a
new
fire
and
a
new
life
at
evening
when
the
march
wind
had
torn
the
cotton
clouds
to
shreds
we
stood
on
the
mississippi
s
bank
gazing
at
the
western
shore
at
louisiana
the
low
hills
made
a
black
band
against
the
sky
and
above
the
band
hung
the
sun
a
red
ball
he
was
setting
and
man
might
look
upon
his
face
without
fear
the
sight
of
the
waters
of
that
river
stirred
me
to
think
of
many
things
what
had
god
in
store
for
the
vast
land
out
of
which
the
waters
flowed
had
he
indeed
saved
it
for
a
people
a
people
to
be
drawn
from
all
nations
from
all
classes
was
the
principle
of
the
republic
to
prevail
and
spread
and
change
the
complexion
of
the
world
or
were
the
lusts
of
greed
and
power
to
increase
until
in
the
end
they
had
swallowed
the
leaven
who
could
say
what
man
of
those
who
soberly
had
put
his
hand
to
the
paper
which
declared
the
opportunities
of
generations
to
come
could
measure
the
force
which
he
had
helped
to
set
in
motion
we
crossed
the
river
to
the
village
where
i
had
been
so
kindly
received
many
years
ago
to
louis
the
place
was
little
changed
the
wind
was
stilled
the
blue
wood
smoke
curled
lazily
from
the
wide
stone
chimneys
of
the
houses
nestling
against
the
hill
the
afterglow
was
fading
into
night
lights
twinkled
in
the
windows
followed
by
our
servants
we
climbed
the
bank
hélène
and
i
and
walked
the
quiet
streets
bordered
by
palings
the
evening
was
chill
we
passed
a
bright
cabaret
from
which
came
the
sound
of
many
voices
in
the
blacksmith
s
shop
another
group
was
gathered
and
we
saw
faces
eager
in
the
red
light
they
were
talking
of
the
cession
we
passed
that
place
where
nick
had
stopped
suzanne
in
the
cart
and
laughed
at
the
remembrance
we
came
to
monsieur
gratiot
s
for
he
had
bidden
us
to
stay
with
him
and
with
madame
he
gave
us
a
welcome
to
warm
our
hearts
after
our
journey
david
he
said
i
have
seen
many
strange
things
happen
in
my
life
but
the
strangest
of
all
is
that
clark
s
drummer
boy
should
have
married
a
vicomtesse
of
the
old
and
she
was
ever
madame
la
vicomtesse
to
our
good
friends
in
louis
for
she
was
a
woman
to
whom
a
title
came
as
by
nature
s
right
and
you
are
about
to
behold
another
strange
thing
david
monsieur
gratiot
continued
you
are
on
french
french
territory
i
exclaimed
upper
louisiana
is
french
he
answered
it
will
be
american
forever
this
morning
captain
stoddard
of
the
united
states
army
empowered
to
act
as
a
commissioner
of
the
french
republic
arrived
with
captain
lewis
and
a
guard
of
american
troops
today
at
noon
the
flag
of
spain
was
lowered
from
the
staff
at
the
headquarters
a
guard
of
honor
watches
with
the
french
tricolor
and
we
are
french
for
the
last
time
we
shall
be
i
saw
that
simple
ceremony
the
little
company
of
soldiers
was
drawn
up
before
the
low
stone
headquarters
the
villagers
with
heads
uncovered
gathered
round
about
i
saw
the
stars
and
stripes
rising
the
tricolor
setting
they
met
midway
on
the
staff
hung
together
for
a
space
and
a
salute
to
the
two
nations
echoed
among
the
hills
across
the
waters
of
the
great
river
that
rolled
impassive
by
afterword
this
book
has
been
named
the
crossing
because
i
have
tried
to
express
in
it
the
beginnings
of
that
great
movement
across
the
mountains
which
swept
resistless
over
the
continent
until
at
last
it
saw
the
pacific
itself
the
crossing
was
the
first
instinctive
reaching
out
of
an
infant
nation
which
was
one
day
to
become
a
giant
no
annals
in
the
world
s
history
are
more
wonderful
than
the
story
of
the
conquest
of
kentucky
and
tennessee
by
the
pioneers
this
name
the
crossing
is
likewise
typical
in
another
sense
the
political
faith
of
our
forefathers
of
which
the
constitution
is
the
creed
was
made
to
fit
a
more
or
less
homogeneous
body
of
people
who
proved
that
they
knew
the
meaning
of
the
word
by
liberty
our
forefathers
meant
the
duty
as
well
as
the
right
of
man
to
govern
himself
the
constitution
amply
attests
the
greatness
of
its
authors
but
it
was
a
compromise
it
was
an
attempt
to
satisfy
thirteen
colonies
each
of
which
clung
tenaciously
to
its
identity
it
suited
the
conditions
of
a
little
confederacy
along
the
seaboard
far
removed
from
the
world
s
strife
and
jealousy
it
scarcely
contemplated
that
the
harassed
millions
of
europe
would
flock
to
its
fold
and
it
did
not
foresee
that
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
its
own
citizens
would
sweep
across
the
three
thousand
miles
of
forest
and
plain
and
mountain
to
the
western
ocean
absorb
french
and
spanish
louisiana
spanish
texas
mexico
and
california
fill
this
land
with
broad
farmsteads
and
populous
cities
cover
it
with
a
network
of
railroads
would
the
constitution
made
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
little
confederacy
of
the
seaboard
stretch
over
a
continent
and
an
empire
we
are
fighting
out
that
question
but
the
crossing
was
in
daniel
boone
s
time
in
george
rogers
clark
s
would
the
constitution
stand
the
strain
and
will
it
stand
the
strain
now
that
the
once
remote
haven
of
the
oppressed
has
become
a
it
was
a
difficult
task
in
a
novel
to
gather
the
elements
necessary
to
picture
this
movement
the
territory
was
vast
the
types
bewildering
the
lonely
mountain
cabin
the
seigniorial
life
of
the
the
foothills
and
mountains
which
the
have
marked
for
their
own
to
this
day
the
wilderness
trail
the
wonderland
of
kentucky
and
the
cruel
fighting
in
the
border
forts
there
against
the
most
relentless
of
foes
george
rogers
clark
and
his
momentous
campaign
which
gave
to
the
republic
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
the
transition
period
the
coming
of
the
settler
after
the
pioneer
louisiana
louis
and
new
orleans
to
cover
this
ground
to
picture
the
passions
and
politics
of
the
time
to
bring
the
counter
influence
of
the
french
revolution
as
near
as
possible
to
reality
has
been
a
three
years
task
the
autobiography
of
david
ritchie
is
as
near
as
i
can
get
to
its
solution
and
i
have
a
great
sense
of
its
incompleteness
i
had
hoped
when
i
planned
the
series
to
bring
down
this
novel
through
the
stirring
period
which
ended
by
a
chance
when
a
steamboat
brought
supplies
to
jackson
s
army
in
new
orleans
the
beginning
of
the
era
of
steam
commerce
on
our
western
waters
this
work
will
have
to
be
reserved
for
a
future
time
i
have
tried
to
give
a
true
history
of
clark
s
campaign
as
seen
by
an
eyewitness
trammelled
as
little
as
possible
by
romance
elsewhere
as
i
look
back
through
these
pages
i
feel
as
though
the
soil
had
only
been
scraped
what
principality
in
the
world
has
the
story
to
rival
that
of
john
sevier
and
the
state
of
franklin
i
have
tried
to
tell
the
truth
as
i
went
along
general
jackson
was
a
boy
at
the
waxhaws
and
dug
his
toes
in
the
red
mud
he
was
a
man
at
jonesboro
and
tradition
says
that
he
fought
with
a
sevier
was
captured
as
narrated
monsieur
gratiot
monsieur
vigo
and
father
gibault
lost
the
money
which
they
gave
to
clark
and
their
country
monsieur
vigo
actually
travelled
in
the
state
which
davy
describes
when
he
went
down
the
river
with
him
monsieur
gratiot
and
colonel
auguste
chouteau
and
madame
chouteau
are
names
so
well
known
in
louis
that
it
is
superfluous
to
say
that
such
persons
existed
and
were
the
foremost
citizens
of
the
community
among
the
many
to
whom
my
apologies
and
thanks
are
due
is
pierre
chouteau
of
louis
whose
unremitting
labors
have

notes
welcome
to
the
project
gutenberg
edition
of
the
crossing
by
winston
churchill
we
have
used
the
original
publication
of
this
book
the
macmillan
edition
as
the
source
for
our
transcription
on
a
few
occasions
changes
were
made
to
correct
obvious
errors
differences
between
the
text
and
are
explained
here
a
few
items
that
may
be
errors
are
listed
below
but
we
did
not
correct
an
error
unless
it
was
an
obvious
one
sometimes
a
word
had
been
hyphenated
in
the
book
to
split
across
two
lines
for
even
spacing
thus
forcing
the
transcriber
to
make
a
choice
some
of
those
decisions
are
listed
below
page
changed
a
double
quote
nested
inside
of
a
double
quote
to
use
single
quotes
behold
i
became
behold
i
page
journeycakes
is
spelled
without
a
hyphen
here
but
the
of
page
and
page
had
a
hyphen
there
were
four
occurrences
of
and
and
no
other
occurrences
of
the
word
spelled
without
a
hyphen
the
inconsistency
was
retained
page
the
repeating
at
all
at
all
looks
like
a
typo
but
churchill
also
used
at
all
at
all
on
page
no
changes
were
made
page
was
hyphenated
between
two
lines
so
could
be
transcribed
as
or
grogshop
with
no
other
examples
in
the
novel
we
went
with
the
latter
no
hyphen
page
the
word
split
across
two
lines
with
a
hyphen
could
be
transcribed
as
threescore
or
two
lines
after
that
word
a
sentence
began
threescore
years
the
word
was
hyphenated
for
spacing
and
not
transcribed
with
a
hyphen
page
add
after
temple
temple
she
page
was
split
between
two
lines
for
spacing
purposes
the
decision
to
retain
the
hyphen
in
the
transcription
is
traced
to
a
prior
use
of
the
word
in
this
novel
on
page
was
spelled
with
a
hyphen
and
the
word
was
in
the
middle
of
a
line
on
page
and
page
changed
double
quotes
nested
inside
of
double
quotes
to
single
quotes
for
example
ay
ay
became
ay
ay
page
place
period
after
all
the
tribes
page
remove
comma
after
tinkle
of
a
guitar
page
was
mounsier
de
at
home
this
question
should
end
in
a
question
mark
but
the
author
put
a
period
so
did
we
page
ignored
hyphen
in
black
in
print
the
hyphen
occurred
at
the
end
of
a
line
however
the
novel
writes
forest
swamp
on
page
and
forest
swamps
on
page
and
never
uses
this
inconsistency
was
assumed
to
be
a
mistake
in
typesetting
page
fianancier
may
be
dialect
but
in
other
quotes
of
characters
it
is
spelled
see
page
page
and
page
no
change
was
made
page
the
verse
following
caroline
is
printed
to
sheet
music
in
the
book
page
the
preposition
to
is
missing
from
the
following
phrase
she
drew
the
ivory
from
her
gown
and
gave
it
gave
it
to
me
sounds
better
nevertheless
the
sentence
was
written
without
the
to
and
it
remains
as
the
author
wrote
it
in
the
some
inconsistencies
were
highlighted
above
but
there
also
were
instances
where
new
orléans
was
given
an
acute
accent
but
more
often
so
it
was
not
the
same
occurred
with
miró
another
inconsistency
was
the
author
italicizing
banquette
and
piastre
as
part
of
his
rule
of
italicizing
foreign
words
but
failing
to
do
so
all
the
time
we
retained
these
inconsistencies
in
transcribing
the
book
there
were
some
cases
where
it
was
difficult
to
distinguish
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
space
before
the
contraction
was
not
spaced
for
common
contractions
such
as
i
he
they
however
there
was
a
space
for
breed
what
and
other
uncommon
contractions
formed
with
sometimes
with
line
compression
to
justify
the
text
it
is
difficult
to
tell
whether
there
should
or
should
not
be
a
space
between
the
two
parts
of
the
uncommon
contraction
in
those
cases
where
it
was
difficult
to
tell
we
applied
the
convention
as
stated
above
two
confusing
passages
to
transcribe
are
davy
narration
on
page
and
page
and
hélène
narration
on
page
other
paragraphs
contain
quotes
embedded
within
quotes
we
changed
double
quotes
nested
inside
of
double
quotes
to
single
quotes
because
our
utilities
flag
the
second
double
quote
as
an
error
