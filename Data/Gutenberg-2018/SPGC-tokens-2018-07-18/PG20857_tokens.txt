a
thrilling
new
serial
of
interplanetary
life
and
travel
by

smith
of
skylark
of

and
skylark
three
spacehounds
of
ipc
good
many
of
us
who
are
now
certain
beyond
a
doubt
that
space
travel
will
forever
remain
in
the
realm
of
the
impossible
probably
would
if
a
rocket
that
were
shot
to
the
moon
for
instance
did
arrive
and
perhaps
return
to
give
proof
of
its
safe
arrival
on
our
satellite
accept
the
phenomenon
in
a
perfectly
blas√©
twentieth
century
manner
smith
that
phenomenal
writer
of
classic
scientific
fiction
seems
to
have
become
so
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
advent
of
interplanetary
travel
that
it
is
difficult
for
the
reader
to
feel
after
finishing
spacehounds
of
ipc
that
travel
in
the
great
spaces
is
not
already
an
established
fact
smith
as
a
professional
chemist
is
kept
fairly
busy
as
a
writer
he
is
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
perfection
for
that
reason
a
masterpiece
from
his
pen
has
become
almost
an
annual
event
we
know
you
will
like
spacehounds
even
better
than
the
skylark
illustrated
by
wesso
chapter
i
the
ipv
sets
out
for
mars
a
narrow
football
of
steel
the
interplanetary
vessel
stood
upright
in
her
berth
in
the
dock
like
an
egg
in
its
cup
a
hundred
feet
across
and
a
hundred
and
seventy
feet
deep
was
that
gigantic
bowl
its
walls
supported
by
the
structural
steel
and
concrete
of
the
dock
and
lined
with
of
hemp
and
fibre
high
into
the
air
extended
the
upper
half
of
the
ship
of
space
a
sullen
gray
expanse
of
hardened
steel
armor
curving
smoothly
upward
to
a
needle
prow
countless
hundred
of
fine
vertical
scratches
marred
every
inch
of
her
surface
and
here
and
there
the
stubborn
metal
was
grooved
and
scored
to
a
depth
of
inches
each
scratch
and
score
the
record
of
an
attempt
of
some
wandering
cosmic
body
to
argue
the
with
the
stupendous
mass
of
that
cruiser
of
the
void
a
burly
young
man
made
his
way
through
the
throng
about
the
entrance
nodded
unconcernedly
to
the
gatekeeper
and
joined
the
stream
of
passengers
flowing
through
the
triple
doors
of
the
double
and
down
a
corridor
to
the
center
of
the
vessel
however
instead
of
entering
one
of
the
elevators
which
were
whisking
the
passengers
up
to
their
staterooms
in
the
upper
half
of
the
enormous
football
he
in
some
way
caused
an
opening
to
appear
in
an
apparently
blank
steel
wall
and
stepped
through
it
into
the
control
room
hi
breck
the
burly
one
called
as
he
strode
up
to
the
of
the
chief
pilot
and
tossed
his
bag
carelessly
into
a
corner
behold
your
computer
in
the
flesh
what
all
this
howl
and
fuss
about
poor
computation
hello
steve
the
chief
pilot
smiled
as
he
shook
hands
cordially
glad
to
see
you
again
but
do
try
to
kid
the
old
man
i
simple
enough
to
believe
almost
anything
but
some
things
just
are
being
done
we
have
been
yelling
and
yelling
hard
for
trained
computers
ever
since
they
started
riding
us
about
every
one
centimeter
change
in
acceleration
but
i
know
that
you
no
more
an
computer
than
i
am
a
digger
indian
they
do
shoot
sparrows
with
guns
illustration
thanks
for
the
compliment
breck
but
i
your
computer
for
this
trip
anyway
newton
the
good
old
egg
knows
what
you
fellows
are
up
against
and
is
going
to
do
something
about
it
if
he
has
to
lick
all
the
rest
of
the
directors
to
do
it
he
knew
that
i
was
loose
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
asked
me
to
come
along
this
trip
to
see
what
i
could
see
i
to
check
the
observatory
data
they
do
know
i
aboard
take
the
peaks
and
valleys
off
your
acceleration
curve
if
possible
and
report
to
newton
just
what
i
find
out
and
what
i
think
should
be
done
about
it
how
early
am
i
while
the
newcomer
was
talking
he
had
stripped
the
covers
from
a
precise
scale
model
of
the
solar
system
and
from
a
large
and
complicated
calculating
machine
and
had
set
to
work
without
a
wasted
motion
or
instant
scaling
off
upon
the
model
the
positions
of
the
various
and
setting
up
long
and
involved
integrals
and
equations
upon
the
calculator
the
older
man
studied
the
broad
back
of
the
younger
bent
over
his
computations
and
a
tender
almost
fatherly
smile
came
over
his
careworn
face
as
he
replied
early
you
just
like
you
always
were
plus
fifteen
seconds
on
the
deadline
the
final
dope
is
due
right
now
he
plugged
the
automatic
recorder
and
speaker
into
a
circuit
marked
observatory
waited
until
a
tiny
light
above
the
plug
flashed
green
and

must
stay
further

from

you
will
hold

between

your
will
be
practically
unobstructed
but
you
will
have
to
use
the
utmost
caution
in
landing
upon
mars
because
in
order
to
avoid
a
weightless
detour
and
a
loss
of
minutes
you
must
pass
very
close
to
both

breckenridge
studied
his
triplex
chronometer
intently
then
unplugged

glanced
around

the
second
assistant
was
galvanized
into
activity
and
upon
a
screen
before
him
there
appeared
a
view
as
though
he
were
looking
directly
upward
from
the
prow
of
the
great
vessel
the
air
above
them
was
full
of
aircraft
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
and
occasionally
the
image
of
one
of
that
flying
horde
flared
into
violet
splendor
upon
the
screen
as
it
was
caught
in
the
mighty
roving

of
one
of

the

all

was
the
report
after
each
of
the
twelve
of
the
stern
had
swung
around
in
its
supporting

illuminating
every
recess
of

the

and
the

fifteen
minutes
remained
during
which
time
one

after
another
would
report
to
the
captain
of
the
liner
that
everything
in
his
charge
was
ready
for
the
stupendous
flight
all
x
steve
breckenridge
turned
to
the
computer
how
do
you
check
acceleration
and
power
with
the
observatory
not
so
good
old
bean
the
younger
man
frowned
in
thought
they
figure
like
astronomers
not
navigators
they
made
no
allowances
for
anything
not
even
the
reversal
and
i
figure
four
thousands
for
that
and
for
minor
detours
then
there
check
station
errors
errors
why
they
always
right
that
what
for
do
fool
yourself
they
got
troubles
of
their
own
the
same
as
anybody
else
in
fact
from
a
study
of
the
charts
of
the
last
few
weeks
i
pretty
sure
that
is
at
least
four
thousand
kilometers
this
side
of
where
he
thinks
he
is
that
is
ten
or
twelve
thousand
beyond
his
station
and
that
they
both
got
a
lateral
displacement
that
simply
fierce
i
going
to
check
up
and
argue
with
them
about
it
as
we
pass
then
there
another
thing
they
figure
to
only
two
places
and
got
to
have
the
third
place
almost
solid
if
we
expect
to
get
a
smooth
curve
a
hundredth
of
a
centimeter
of
acceleration
means
a
lot
on
a
long
trip
when
they
holding
us
as
close
as
they
are
doing
now
we
ride
this
trip
on
centimeters
with
our
scheduled
mass
that
means
thirty
six
points
of
four
seven
kilofranks
equilibrium
power
all
set
to
go
the
computer
stated
as
he
changed
by
fractions
of
arc
the
of
the
automatic
integrating
goniometer
you
the
doctor
but
i
glad
it
you
that
have
to
explain
to
the
observatory
and
breckenridge
set
his
exceedingly
delicate
excess
power
potentiometer
exactly
upon
the
indicated
figure
well
we
got
a
few
minutes
left
for
a
before
we
lift
her
off
what
all
this
commotion
about
dish
out
the
well
it
like
this
steve
we
pilots
are
having
one
sweet
time
we
being
growled
at
on
every
trip
the
management
squawks
if
we
thirty
seconds
plus
or
minus
at
the
terminals
and
the
passenger
department
squalls
if
we
change
acceleration
five
centimeters
total
en
route
claims
it
upsets
the
dainty
customers
and
loses
business
for
the
road
they
tightening
up
on
us
all
the
time
a
couple
of
years
ago
you
remember
it
did
make
any
difference
what
we
did
with
the
acceleration
as
long
as
we
checked
in
somewhere
near
zero
time
we
used
to
spin
dizzy
when
we
reversed
at
the
station
but
that
kind
of
stuff
does
go
any
more
we
got
to
hold
the
acceleration
constant
and
close
to
normal
got
to
hold
our
schedule
on
zero
or
ten
seconds
and
yet
we
got
to
make
any
detours
they
tell
us
to
such
as
this
kilometer
thing
they
handed
us
just
now
to
make
things
worse
we
got
to
take
orders
at
every
and
yet
get
the
blame
for
everything
that
happens
as
a
consequence
of
obeying
those
orders
of
course
i
know
as
well
as
you
do
that
it
rotten
technique
to
change
acceleration
at
every
but
we
told
over
and
over
that
we
ca
do
any
better
until
they
put
a
real
computer
on
every
ship
and
tell
the
to
report
meteorites
and
other
obstructions
to
us
and
then
to
let
us
alone
so
you
better
recommend
us
some
computers
you
getting
rotten
computation
that
a
sure
thing
and
i
blame
you
pilots
for
yelling
but
i
do
believe
that
you
got
the
right
answer
i
ca
help
but
think
that
the
astronomers
are
lying
down
on
the
job
they
are
so
sure
that
you
pilots
are
to
blame
that
it
occurred
to
them
to
check
up
on
themselves
very
carefully
however
we
know
pretty
quick
and
then
we
take
steps
i
hope
so
but
say
steve
i
worried
about
using
that
much
plus
equilibrium
power
remember
we
got
to
hit
in
absolutely
good
shape
or
plenty
heads
will
drop
i
say
they
will
i
know
just
how
the
passengers
will
howl
if
we
hold
them
weightless
for
half
an
hour
waiting
for
those
two
moons
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
i
know
just
what
the
manager
will
do
if
we
check
in
minus
minutes
wow
he
swell
up
and
bust
sure
but
worry
breck
if
we
do
check
in
all
right
anybody
can
have
my
head
that
wants
it
and
i
taking
full
responsibility
you
know
you
welcome
to
it
breckenridge
shrugged
and
turned
the
conversation
into
a
lighter
vein
speaking
of
weightlessness
it
funny
how
many
there
are
in
the
world
it
you
think
the
passengers
would
enjoy
a
little
weightlessness
occasionally
especially
the
fat
ones
but
they
do
but
say
while
i
think
of
it
how
come
you
were
here
and
loose
to
make
this
i
thought
you
were
out
with
the
other
two
of
the
big
three
solving
all
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
had
to
stay
in
this
last
trip
been
doing
some
work
on
the
ether
theory
and
other
advanced
stuff
that
i
had
to
go
to
mars
and
venus
to
get
just
got
back
last
week
as
for
solving
mysteries
laugh
while
you
can
old
hyena
you
and
a
lot
of
other
dim
bulbs
think
that
roeser
rays
are
the
last
word
that
there
nothing
left
to
discover
are
going
to
get
jarred
loose
from
your
hinges
one
of
these
days
when
i
came
in
nine
months
ago
they
were
hot
on
the
trail
of
something
big
and
i
bet
they
bring
it
in
out
upon
the
dock
an
insistent
siren
blared
a
crescendo
and
diminuendo
blast
of
sound
and
two
minutes
remained
in
every
stateroom
and
in
every
lounge
and
saloon
speakers
sounded
a
warning
for
a
short
time
while
we
are
pulling
clear
of
the
gravitational
field
of
the
earth
walking
will
be
somewhat
difficult
as
everything
on
board
will
apparently
increase
in
weight
by
about
of
its
present
amount
please
remain
seated
or
move
about
with
caution
in
about
an
hour
weight
will
gradually
return
to
normal
we
start
in
one
minute
hipe
barked
the
chief
pilot
as
a
flaring
purple
light
sprang
into
being
upon
his
board
and
the
assistants
came
to
attention
at
their
stations
seconds
four
three
two
one
lift
he
touched
a
button
and
a
set
of
plunger
switches
drove
home
releasing
into
the
enormous
driving
projectors
the
equilibrium
power
the
kilofranks
of
energy
that
exactly
counterbalanced
the
pull
of
gravity
upon
the
mass
of
the
cruiser
simultaneously
there
was
added
from
the
potentiometer
already
set
to
the
exact
figure
given
by
the
computer
the
power
which
would
not
be
changed
throughout
the
journey
if
the
ideal
acceleration
curve
were
to
be
registered
upon
the
recorders
and
the
immense
mass
of
the
cruiser
of
the
void
wafted
vertically
upward
at
a
low
and
constant
velocity
the
bellowing
shrieking
siren
had
cleared
the
air
magically
of
the
swarm
of
aircraft
in
her
path
and
quietly
calmly
majestically
the
floated
upward
breckenridge
sixty
seconds
after
the
initial
lift
actuated
the
system
of
magnetic
relays
which
would
gradually
cut
in
the
precisely
measured
starting
power
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
employ
for
minutes
for
without
the
acceleration
given
by
this
additional
power
they
would
lose
many
precious
hours
of
time
in
covering
merely
the
few
thousands
of
miles
during
which
earth
attraction
would
operate
powerfully
against
their
progress
faster
and
faster
the
great
cruiser
shot
upward
as
more
and
more
of
the
starting
power
was
released
and
heavier
and
heavier
the
passengers
felt
themselves
become
soon
the
full
calculated
power
was
on
and
the
acceleration
became
constant
weight
no
longer
increased
but
remained
constant
at
a
value
of
plus
twenty
three
and
percent
for
a
few
moments
there
had
been
uneasy
stomachs
among
the
passengers
perhaps
a
few
of
the
had
been
made
ill
but
it
was
not
much
worse
than
riding
in
a
elevator
particularly
since
there
was
no
change
from
positive
to
negative
acceleration
such
as
is
experienced
in
express
elevators
the
computer
his
calculations
complete
watched
the
pilot
with
interest
for
accustomed
as
he
was
to
traversing
the
depths
of
space
there
was
a
thrill
to
his
scientific
mind
in
the
delicacy
and
precision
of
the
work
which
breckenridge
was
doing
work
which
could
be
done
only
by
a
man
who
had
had
long
training
in
the
profession
and
who
was
possessed
of
instantaneous
nervous
reaction
and
of
the
highest
degree
of
manual
dexterity
and
control
under
his
right
and
left
hands
were
the
potentiometers
actuating
the
drives
of
the
directors
in
the
hour
and
declination
ranges
before
his
eyes
was
the
finely
marked
micrometer
screen
upon
which
the
guiding
goniometer
threw
its
of
light
powerful
optical
systems
of
prisms
and
lenses
revealed
to
his
sight
the
down
to
fractional
seconds
of
arc
it
was
the
task
of
the
chief
pilot
to
hold
the
screened
image
of
the
of
the
two
directors
in
such
position
relative
to
the
point
of
light
as
to
hold
the
mighty
vessel
precisely
upon
its
course
in
spite
of
the
complex
system
of
forces
acting
upon
it
for
almost
an
hour
breckenridge
sat
motionless
his
eyes
flashing
from
micrometer
screen
to
signal
panel
his
sensitive
fingers
moving
the
potentiometers
through
minute
arcs
because
of
what
he
saw
upon
the
screen
and
in
instantaneous
response
to
the
flashing
lights
and
tinkling
signals
of
his
board
finally
far
from
earth
the
moon
attraction
and
other
perturbing
forces
comparatively
slight
the
signals
no
longer
sounded
and
the
point
of
light
ceased
its
irregular
motion
becoming
almost
stationary
the
chief
pilot
brought
both
directly
upon
the
brilliant
point
which
for
some
time
they
had
been
approaching
more
and
more
nearly
adjusted
the
and
amplifiers
which
would
hold
them
immovably
upon
it
and
at
the
calculated
second
of
time
cut
out
the
starting
power
by
means
of
another
set
of
automatically
timed
relays
when
only
the
regular
driving
power
was
left
and
the
acceleration
had
been
checked
and
found
to
be
exactly
the
designated
value
of
centimeters
he
stood
up
and
heaved
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
well
steve
that
over
with
we
on
our
way
i
always
glad
when
this
part
of
it
is
done
it
a
ticklish
job
no
fooling
even
for
an
expert
the
mathematician
agreed
no
wonder
the
astronomers
think
you
birds
are
the
ones
who
are
gumming
up
their
dope
well
it
about
time
to
plug
in
on
where
the
fireworks
start
he
closed
the
connections
which
transferred
the
central
portion
of
the
upper
lookout
screen
to
a
small
micrometer
screen
at
breckenridge
desk
and
plugged
it
into
the
first
instantly
a
point
of
red
light
surrounded
by
a
vivid
orange
circle
appeared
upon
the
screen
low
down
and
to
the
left
of
center
and
the
timing
galvanometer
showed
a
wide
positive
deflection
hashed
again
growled
breckenridge
i
must
be
losing
my
grip
i
guess
i
put
everything
i
had
on
that
sight
and
missed
it
ten
divisions
i
think
i
turn
in
my
badge
i
cocked
our
perfect
curve
already
before
we
got
to
the
first
his
hands
moved
toward
the
controls
to
correct
their
course
and
acceleration
as
you
were
hold
everything
lay
off
those
controls
snapped
the
computer
there
something
screwy
just
as
i
thought
and
it
you
either
i
no
pilot
of
course
but
i
do
know
good
compensation
when
i
see
it
and
if
you
were
compensating
that
point
i
never
saw
it
done
besides
with
your
skill
and
my
figures
i
know
darn
well
that
we
are
off
more
than
a
tenth
of
one
division
he
cuckoo
do
call
him
let
him
start
it
and
refer
him
to
me
all
x
i
be
only
too
glad
to
pass
the
buck
but
i
still
think
steve
that
you
playing
with
dynamite
who
ever
heard
of
an
astronomer
being
wrong
you
be
surprised
grinned
the
physicist
since
this
fuss
has
just
started
nobody
has
tried
to
find
out
whether
they
were
wrong
or
not
ipv
attention
came
from
the
speaker
curtly
ipv
breckenridge
from
the
chief
pilot
you
have
been
on
my
ray
almost
a
minute
why
are
you
not
correcting
course
and
acceleration
doctor
stevens
is
computing
us
and
has
full
control
of
course
and
acceleration
replied
breckenridge
he
will
answer
you
i
am
changing
neither
course
nor
acceleration
because
you
are
not
in
position
declared
stevens
crisply
please
give
me
your
present
supposed
location
and
your
latest
precision
goniometer
bearings
on
the
sun
the
moon
mars
venus
and
your
tellurian
reference
limb
with
exact
time
of
observations
gyroscope
and
goniometer
factors
correct
at
once
or
i
shall
report
you
to
the
observatory
answered
loftily
paying
no
attention
to
the
demand
for
proof
of
position
be
sure
you
do
that
guy
and
while
you
at
it
report
that
your
station
has
taken
a
precision
bearing
in
a
month
report
that
been
muddling
along
on
radio
loop
bearings
and
that
you
do
know
where
you
are
within
seven
thousand
kilometers
and
speaking
of
reporting
i
know
already
that
a
lot
of
you
astronomical
guessers
have
only
the
faintest
possible
idea
of
where
you
really
are
or
lateral
and
if
you
do
get
yourselves
straightened
out
before
we
get
to
i
going
to
make
a
report
on
my
own
account
that
will
jar
some
of
you
birds
loose
from
your
upper
teeth
he
unplugged
with
a
vicious
jerk
and
turned
to
the
pilot
with
a
grin
guess
that
hold
him
for
a
while
wo
it
he
report
us
sure
remonstrated
breckenridge
the
older
man
was
plainly
ill
at
ease
at
this
open
defiance
of
the
supposedly
infallible
not
that
baby
returned
the
computer
confidently
i
bet
you
a
small
farm
against
a
plugged
nickel
that
right
now
he
working
his
goniometer
so
hard
that
it
pivots
are
getting
hot
he
sneak
back
into
position
as
soon
as
he
can
calculate
his
results
and
pretend
always
been
there
the
others
will
be
all
right
then
probably
by
the
time
we
get
to
them
gosh
no
you
unusually
dumb
today
breck
he
wo
tell
anybody
anything
he
does
want
to
be
the
only
goat
does
he
oh
i
see
how
could
you
dope
this
out
with
only
the
recorder
charts
because
i
know
the
kind
of
stuff
you
pilots
are
and
those
humps
are
altogether
too
big
to
be
accounted
for
by
anything
i
know
about
you
another
thing
the
next
station
i
think
is
keeping
himself
all
x
if
so
when
you
corrected
for
which
was
wrong
it
throw
you
all
off
on
which
was
right
and
so
on
a
bad
hump
at
almost
every
see
true
to
prediction
the
pilot
ray
of
came
in
almost
upon
the
exact
center
of
the
micrometer
screen
and
breckenridge
smiled
in
relief
as
he
began
really
to
enjoy
the
trip
how
do
we
check
on
chronometers
asked
when
stevens
had
been
introduced
by
my
time
you
seem
to
be
about
two
and
a
half
seconds
all
x
two
points
four
seconds
plus
we
riding
on
centimeters
to
allow
for
the
reversal
and
for
minor
detours
bye
all
this
may
have
been
coincidence
breck
but
we
find
out
pretty
quick
now
the
computer
remarked
when
the
flying
vessel
was
nearing
the
third
unless
i
all
out
of
control
we
check
in
almost
fourteen
seconds
minus
on
and
we
may
not
even
find
him
on
the
center
block
of
the
screen
when
he
plugged
in
was
on
the
block
but
was
in
the
extreme
upper
right
corner
they
checked
in
thirteen
and
seconds
minus
on
the
station
and
a
fiery
dialogue
ensued
when
the
computer
questioned
the
accuracy
of
the
location
of
the
station
and
refused
to
correct
his
course
well
breck
old
onion
that
tears
it
stevens
declared
as
he
unplugged
no
use
going
any
further
on
these
bum
reference
points
i
going
to
report
to
newton
he
rock
the
observatory
on
its
foundations
he
plugged
into
the
telegraph
room
have
you
got
a
free
wave
please
put
me
on
newton
in
the
main
office
moving
lights
flashed
and
flickered
for
an
instant
upon
the
communicator
screen
settling
down
into
a
white
glow
which
soon
resolved
itself
into
the
likeness
of
a
man
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
remote
office
of
the
interplanetary
corporation
newton
smiled
as
he
recognized
the
likeness
of
stevens
upon
his
own
screen
and
greeted
him
cordially
have
you
started
your
investigation
doctor
stevens
started
it
i
finished
it
and
stevens
tersely
reported
what
he
had
learned
concluding
so
you
see
you
do
need
special
computers
on
these
ships
any
more
than
a
hen
needs
teeth
you
got
all
the
computers
you
need
in
the
observatories
all
you
got
to
do
is
make
them
work
at
their
trade
the
piloting
was
all
x
then
absolutely
our
curve
so
far
is
exactly
flat
ever
since
we
cut
off
the
starting
power
of
course
all
the
pilots
ca
be
as
good
as
breckenridge
but
give
them
good
computation
and
good
check
points
and
you
should
get
any
humps
higher
than
about
half
a
centimeter
they
get
both
from
now
on
the
director
assured
him
thanks
if
your
work
for
the
trip
is
done
you
might
show
my
little
girl
nadia
around
the
she
never
been
out
before
and
will
be
interested
would
you
mind
glad
to
newton
i
be
a
regular
uncle
to
her
thanks
again
operator
i
speak
to
captain
king
please
pipe
down
that
guff
you
unlicked
cub
or
i
crown
you
with
a
the
chief
pilot
growled
as
soon
as
stevens
had
unplugged
you
and
who
else
retorted
the
computer
cheerfully
pipe
down
yourself
guy
if
you
were
so
darn
dumb
and
did
have
such
a
complex
you
know
that
you
the
crack
pilot
of
the
outfit
and
would
care
who
else
knew
it
stevens
carefully
covered
and
put
away
the
calculating
machine
and
other
apparatus
he
had
been
using
and
turned
again
to
the
pilot
i
did
know
newton
had
any
kids
especially
little
ones
or
i
have
got
acquainted
with
them
long
ago
of
course
i
do
know
him
very
well
since
i
never
was
around
the
office
much
but
the
old
tiger
goes
over
big
with
me
hm
think
you
enjoy
playing
nursemaid
all
the
rest
of
the
trip
breckenridge
asked
caustically
but
with
an
enigmatic
smile
think
so
i
so
replied
stevens
positively
i
always
did
like
kids
and
they
always
did
like
me
we
fall
for
each
other
like
ten
thousand
bricks
falling
down
a
well
why
a
kid
kid
and
i
team
up
just
like
grace
and
poise
what
gnawing
on
you
anyway
to
make
you
turn
cheshire
cat
all
of
a
sudden
by
the
looks
of
that
grin
say
you
had
swallowed
a
canary
of
mine
some
way
or
other
but
darned
if
i
know
that
i
lost
any
and
he
stared
at
his
friend
suspiciously
to
borrow
your
own
phrase
steve
be
surprised
and
breckenridge
though
making
no
effort
to
conceal
his
amusement
would
say
no
more
in
a
few
minutes
the
door
opened
and
through
it
there
stepped
a
grizzled
almost
hidden
behind
his
massive
form
there
was
a
girl
who
ran
up
to
breckenridge
and
seized
both
his
hands
her
eyes
sparkling
hi
breckie
you
old
darling
i
knew
that
if
we
both
kept
after
him
long
enough
dad
would
let
me
ride
with
you
sometime
is
this
stevens
was
glad
indeed
that
the
girl
enthusiastic
greeting
of
the
pilot
was
giving
him
time
to
recover
from
his
shock
for
director
newton
little
girl
nadia
was
not
precisely
what
he
had
led
himself
to
expect
little
she
might
be
particularly
when
compared
with
the
giant
frame
of
captain
king
or
with
steve
own
of
stature
and
the
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
of
rawhide
and
whalebone
that
was
his
body
but
child
she
certainly
was
not
her
thick
fair
hair
cut
in
the
square
bob
that
was
the
mode
of
the
moment
indicated
that
nature
had
intended
her
to
be
a
creamy
blonde
but
as
she
turned
to
be
introduced
to
him
stevens
received
another
surprise
for
she
was
one
of
those
rare
but
exceedingly
attractive
beings
a
natural
blonde
with
brown
eyes
and
black
eyebrows
sun
and
wind
had
tanned
her
satin
skin
to
a
smooth
and
even
shade
of
brown
and
every
movement
of
her
lithe
and
supple
body
bespoke
to
the
discerning
mind
a
physique
doctor
stevens
you
have
met
miss
newton
i
hear
the
captain
introduced
them
informally
all
the
officers
who
are
not
actually
tied
down
at
their
posts
are
anxious
to
do
the
honors
of
the
vessel
but
as
i
have
received
direct
orders
from
the
owners
i
am
turning
her
over
to
you
you
are
to
show
her
around
thanks
captain
i
wo
mutiny
a
bit
against
such
an
order
i
mighty
glad
to
know
you
miss
newton
i
heard
a
lot
about
you
doctor
dad
and
breckie
here
are
always
talking
about
the
big
three
what
you
have
done
and
what
you
are
going
to
do
i
want
to
meet
doctor
brandon
and
doctor
westfall
too
and
her
hand
met
his
in
a
firm
and
friendly
clasp
she
turned
to
the
captain
and
stevens
noticing
that
the
pilot
with
a
quizzical
expression
was
about
to
say
something
silenced
him
with
a
fierce
aside
clam
it
ape
or
i
climb
up
you
like
a
squirrel
he
hissed
and
the
grinning
breckenridge
nodded
assent
to
this
demand
for
silence
concerning
children
and
nursemaids
since
you
never
been
out
miss
newton
you
want
to
see
the
whole
works
stevens
addressed
the
girl
where
do
you
want
to
begin
shall
we
start
at
the
top
and
work
down
all
right
with
me
she
agreed
and
fell
into
step
beside
him
she
was
dressed
in
from
head
to
foot
toque
blouse
breeches
heavy
stockings
and
shoes
were
of
the
one
shade
of
smooth
lustrous
silk
and
as
they
strolled
together
down
the
the
effortless
ease
and
perfect
poise
of
her
carriage
called
aloud
to
every
fibre
of
his
own
being
we
a
lot
alike
you
and
i
do
you
know
it
he
asked
abruptly
and
unconventionally
yes
i
felt
it
too
she
replied
frankly
and
studied
him
without
affectation
it
has
just
come
to
me
what
it
is
we
both
in
fine
condition
and
in
hard
training
you
an
athlete
of
some
kind
and
sure
you
a
star
i
ought
to
recognize
you
but
i
ashamed
to
say
i
do
what
do
you
do
swim
oh
of
course
stevens
the
great
olympic
high
and
fancy
diver
i
would
have
connected
our
own
doctor
stevens
the
eminent
mathematical
physicist
with
the
king
of
the
springboard
say
ever
since
i
quit
being
afraid
of
the
water
i
had
a
yen
to
do
that
twist
of
yours
but
i
never
met
anybody
who
knew
it
well
enough
to
teach
it
to
me
and
i
almost
broken
my
back
forty
times
trying
to
learn
it
alone
i
got
you
now
too
american
and
british
womens
golf
champion
shake
and
the
two
shook
hands
vigorously
in
mutual
congratulation
tell
you
what
i
give
you
some
pointers
on
diving
and
you
can
show
me
how
to
make
a
golf
ball
behave
next
to
norman
brandon
i
got
the
most
vicious
hook
in
captivity
and
norm
ca
help
himself
you
know
and
being
a
southpaw
he
naturally
wild
he
slices
all
his
woods
and
hooks
all
his
irons
i
consistent
anyway
i
hook
everything
even
my
putts
it
a
bargain
what
do
you
shoot
pretty
dubby
usually
in
the
middle
eighties
none
of
us
play
much
being
out
in
space
most
of
the
time
you
know
sometimes
when
my
hook
is
going
particularly
well
i
go
up
into
the
nineties
we
lick
that
hook
she
promised
as
they
entered
an
elevator
and
were
borne
upward
toward
the
prow
of
the
great
interplanetary
cruiser
chapter
ii
but
does
not
arrive
all
out
we
climb
the
rest
of
the
way
on
foot
stevens
told
his
companion
as
the
elevator
stopped
at
the
uppermost
passenger
floor
they
walked
across
the
small
circular
hall
and
the
guard
on
duty
came
to
attention
and
saluted
as
they
approached
him
i
have
orders
to
pass
you
and
miss
newton
sir
do
you
know
all
the
combinations
i
know
this
good
old
tub
better
than
the
men
that
built
her
i
helped
calculate
her
stevens
replied
as
he
stepped
up
to
an
apparently
blank
wall
of
steel
and
deftly
manipulated
an
almost
invisible
dial
set
flush
with
its
surface
this
is
to
keep
the
passengers
where
they
belong
he
explained
as
a
section
of
the
wall
swung
backward
in
a
short
arc
and
slid
smoothly
aside
we
will
now
proceed
to
see
what
makes
it
tick
ladder
after
ladder
of
steel
they
climbed
and
bulkhead
after
bulkhead
opened
at
stevens
knowing
touch
at
each
floor
the
mathematician
explained
to
the
girl
the
operation
of
the
machinery
there
automatically
at
work
devices
for
heating
and
cooling
devices
for
circulating
maintaining
and
purifying
the
air
and
the
water
in
short
all
the
complex
mechanism
necessary
for
the
comfort
and
convenience
of
the
human
cargo
of
the
liner
soon
they
entered
the
conical
top
compartment
a
room
scarcely
fifteen
feet
in
diameter
tapering
sharply
upward
to
a
hollow
point
some
twenty
feet
above
them
the
true
shape
of
the
room
however
was
not
immediately
apparent
because
of
the
enormous
latticed
beams
and
girders
which
braced
the
walls
in
every
direction
the
air
glowed
with
the
violet
light
of
the
twelve
great
projectors
like
searchlights
with
lenses
which
lined
the
wall
the
floor
beneath
their
feet
was
not
a
level
steel
platform
but
seemed
to
be
composed
of
many
lenticular
sections
of
dull
blue
alloy
we
are
standing
upon
the
upper
lookout
lenses
are
we
asked
the
girl
is
that
perfectly
all
right
sure
they
so
hard
that
nothing
can
scratch
them
and
of
course
roeser
rays
go
right
through
our
bodies
or
any
ordinary
substance
like
a
bullet
through
a
hole
in
a
swiss
cheese
even
those
lenses
would
deflect
them
if
they
were
solid
fields
of
force
as
he
spoke
one
of
the
flashed
around
in
a
short
quick
arc
and
the
girl
saw
that
instead
of
the
fierce
glare
she
had
expected
it
emitted
only
a
soft
violet
light
nevertheless
she
dodged
involuntarily
and
stevens
touched
her
arm
reassuringly
all
x
miss
newton
they
as
harmless
as
mice
they
hardly
ever
have
to
swing
past
the
vertical
and
even
if
one
shines
right
through
you
can
look
it
right
in
the
eye
as
long
as
you
want
to
it
ca
hurt
you
a
bit
no
at
all
none
whatever
just
a
color
one
of
the
many
remaining
crudities
of
our
vision
a
lot
of
good
men
are
studying
this
thing
of
direct
vision
though
and
it
wo
be
long
before
we
have
a
system
that
will
really
work
i
think
it
all
perfectly
wonderful
she
breathed
just
think
of
traveling
in
comfort
through
empty
space
and
of
actually
seeing
through
seamless
steel
walls
without
even
a
sign
of
a
window
how
can
such
things
be
possible
i
have
to
go
pretty
well
back
he
warned
and
any
adequate
explanation
is
bound
to
be
fairly
deep
wading
in
spots
how
technical
can
you
stand
it
i
can
go
down
with
you
middling
deep
i
took
a
lot
of
general
science
and
physics
through
advanced
mechanics
of
course
i
did
get
into
any
such
highly
specialized
stuff
as
or
roeser
rays
but
if
you
start
drowning
me
i
yell
that
fine
you
can
get
the
idea
all
x
with
that
to
go
on
let
sit
down
here
on
this
girder
roeser
did
do
it
all
by
any
means
even
though
he
got
credit
for
it
he
merely
helped
the
martians
do
it
the
whole
thing
started
of
course
when
goddard
shot
his
first
rocket
to
the
moon
and
was
intensified
when
roeser
so
perfected
his
short
waves
that
signals
were
exchanged
with
mars
signals
that
neither
side
could
make
any
sense
out
of
goddard
pupils
and
followers
made
bigger
and
better
rockets
and
finally
got
one
that
could
land
safely
upon
mars
roeser
who
was
a
mighty
keen
bird
was
one
of
the
first
voyagers
and
he
did
come
back
he
stayed
there
living
in
a
for
three
or
four
years
and
got
a
education
martian
science
always
was
hot
you
know
but
they
were
impractical
they
were
desperately
hard
up
for
water
and
air
and
while
they
had
a
lot
of
wonderful
ideas
and
theories
they
could
overcome
the
practical
technical
difficulties
in
the
way
of
making
their
ideas
work
now
putting
other
peoples
ideas
to
work
was
roeser
long
suit
do
think
that
belittling
roeser
at
all
either
for
he
was
a
brave
and
man
was
no
mean
scientist
and
was
certainly
one
of
the
best
organizers
and
synchronizers
the
world
has
ever
known
and
since
martian
and
tellurian
science
complemented
each
other
so
that
one
filled
in
the
gaps
of
the
other
it
was
long
until
fleets
of
were
bringing
in
air
and
water
from
venus
which
had
more
of
both
than
she
needed
or
wanted
having
done
all
he
could
for
the
martians
and
having
learned
most
of
the
stuff
he
wanted
to
know
roeser
came
back
to
tellus
and
organized
interplanetary
with
scientists
and
engineers
on
all
three
planets
and
set
to
work
to
improve
the
whole
system
for
the
vessels
they
used
then
were
dangerous
regular
mankillers
in
fact
at
about
this
same
time
roeser
and
the
interplanetary
corporation
had
a
big
part
in
the
unification
of
the
world
into
one
nation
so
that
wars
could
no
longer
interfere
with
progress
with
this
introduction
i
can
get
down
to
fundamentals
molecules
are
particles
of
the
first
order
and
vibrations
of
the
first
order
include
sound
light
heat
electricity
radio
and
so
on
second
order
atoms
extremely
short
vibrations
such
as
hard
third
order
electrons
and
protons
with
their
accompanying
millikan
or
cosmic
rays
fourth
order
and
these
in
the
material
aspect
are
supposed
to
be
the
particles
of
the
fourth
order
and
in
the
energy
aspect
they
are
known
as
roeser
rays
that
is
these
rays
and
particles
seem
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
both
energy
and
matter
following
me
right
behind
you
she
assured
him
she
had
been
listening
intently
her
brown
eyes
fastened
upon
his
face
since
these
roeser
rays
or
particles
or
rays
of
the
fourth
order
seem
to
be
both
matter
and
energy
and
since
the
rays
can
be
converted
into
what
is
supposed
to
be
the
particles
they
have
been
thought
to
be
the
things
from
which
both
electrons
and
protons
were
built
therefore
everybody
except
norman
brandon
has
supposed
them
the
ultimate
units
of
creation
so
that
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
go
any
further
why
we
were
taught
that
they
the
ultimate
units
she
protested
i
know
you
were
but
we
really
do
know
anything
except
what
we
have
learned
empirically
even
about
our
driving
forces
what
is
called
the
particle
is
absolutely
unknown
since
nobody
has
been
able
to
detect
it
to
say
nothing
of
determining
its
velocity
or
other
properties
it
has
been
assumed
to
have
the
velocity
of
light
only
because
that
hypothesis
does
not
conflict
with
observational
data
going
to
give
you
the
generally
accepted
idea
since
we
have
nothing
definite
to
offer
in
its
place
but
i
warn
you
that
that
idea
is
very
probably
wrong
there
a
lot
of
deep
stuff
down
there
has
been
dug
up
yet
in
fact
brandon
thinks
that
the
product
of
conversion
what
we
think
it
is
at
all
that
the
actual
fundamental
unit
and
the
primary
mechanism
of
the
transformation
lie
somewhere
below
the
fourth
order
and
possibly
even
below
the
level
of
the
ether
but
we
been
able
to
find
a
point
of
attack
yet
that
will
let
us
get
in
anywhere
however
i
getting
ahead
of
our
subject
to
get
back
to
it
energy
can
be
converted
into
something
that
acts
like
matter
through
roeser
rays
and
that
is
the
empirical
fact
underlying
the
drive
of
our
as
well
as
that
of
almost
all
other
vehicles
on
all
three
planets
power
is
generated
by
the
great
waterfalls
of
tellus
and
venus
water
mighty
scarce
on
mars
of
course
so
most
of
our
plants
there
use
fuel
and
is
transmitted
on
light
beams
by
means
of
powerful
fields
of
force
to
the
receptors
wherever
they
may
be
the
individual
transmitting
fields
and
receptors
are
really
simply
units
each
matching
the
electrical
characteristics
of
some
particular
and
unique
beam
of
force
this
beam
is
composed
of
roeser
rays
in
their
energy
aspect
it
took
a
long
time
to
work
out
this
transmission
of
power
but
it
was
fairly
simple
after
they
got
it
he
took
out
a
voluminous
notebook
at
the
sight
of
which
nadia
smiled
a
computer
might
forget
to
dress
but
you
never
catch
one
without
a
full
magazine
pencil
and
a
lot
of
blank
paper
he
grinned
in
reply
and
went
on
writing
as
he
talked
for
any
given
frequency
and
phase
angle
you
integrate
between
limits
zero
and
divided
by
two
sine
theta
d
hold
it
i
sinking
nadia
exclaimed
i
do
integrate
at
all
unless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
as
long
as
you
stick
to
general
science
i
right
on
your
heels
but
please
lay
off
of
integrations
and
all
that
most
especially
stay
away
from
those
terrible
electrical
integrations
i
always
did
think
that
they
were
the
most
poisonous
kind
known
i
want
only
a
general
idea
that
all
that
i
can
understand
anyway
sure
i
forgot
guess
i
was
getting
in
deeper
than
is
necessary
especially
since
this
whole
thing
of
beam
transmission
is
pretty
crude
yet
and
is
bound
to
change
a
lot
before
long
there
is
so
much
loss
that
when
we
get
more
than
a
few
hundred
million
kilometers
away
from
a
we
lose
reception
entirely
but
to
get
going
again
the
receptors
receive
the
beam
and
from
them
the
power
is
sent
to
the
accumulators
where
it
is
stored
these
accumulators
are
an
outgrowth
of
the
storage
battery
the
theory
of
the
accumulator
is
lay
off
the
theory
please
the
listener
interrupted
i
understand
perfectly
without
it
energy
is
stored
in
the
accumulators
you
put
it
in
and
take
it
out
that
all
that
is
necessary
i
like
to
give
you
some
of
the
theory
but
after
all
it
add
much
to
your
understanding
of
the
working
of
things
and
it
might
mix
you
up
as
some
of
it
is
pretty
deep
stuff
then
too
it
would
take
a
lot
of
time
and
the
rest
of
your
friends
would
squawk
if
i
kept
you
here
indefinitely
from
the
accumulators
then
the
power
is
fed
to
the
converters
each
of
which
is
backed
by
a
projector
the
converters
simply
change
the
aspect
of
the
rays
from
the
energy
aspect
to
the
material
aspect
as
soon
as
this
is
done
the
particles
or
whatever
they
are
thus
formed
are
repelled
by
the
terrific
stationary
force
maintained
in
the
projector
backing
the
converter
each
particle
departs
with
a
velocity
supposed
to
be
that
of
light
and
the
recoil
upon
the
projector
drives
the
vessel
or
car
or
whatever
it
is
attached
to
still
with
me
struggling
a
little
but
my
nose
is
still
above
the
surface
these
particles
being
so
infinitesimally
small
that
they
can
not
even
be
detected
go
right
through
any
substance
without
any
effect
they
are
not
even
harmful
exactly
now
we
are
in
position
to
go
ahead
with
the
lights
detectors
and
so
on
the
energy
aspect
of
the
rays
you
can
best
understand
as
simply
a
vibration
in
the
ether
an
extremely
high
frequency
one
while
not
rigidly
scientific
that
is
close
enough
for
you
and
me
nobody
knows
what
the
stuff
really
is
and
it
can
not
be
explained
or
demonstrated
by
any
model
or
concept
in
space
its
interpretation
the
only
way
in
which
it
can
be
grasped
at
all
requires
sixteen
coordinates
in
four
dimensions
and
i
do
suppose
you
care
to
go
into
that
i
say
i
would
she
exclaimed
feelingly
well
anyway
by
the
use
of
suitable
fields
of
force
it
can
be
used
as
a
carrier
wave
most
of
this
stuff
of
the
fields
of
force
how
to
carry
the
modulation
up
and
down
through
all
the
frequency
changes
necessary
was
figured
out
by
the
martians
ages
ago
used
as
a
pure
carrier
wave
with
a
sender
and
a
receiver
at
each
end
it
is
so
bad
that
why
our
communicator
and
radio
systems
work
as
well
as
they
do
they
are
pretty
good
really
but
the
vision
system
is
something
else
again
sending
the
heterodyned
wave
through
steel
is
easy
but
breaking
it
up
so
as
to
view
an
object
and
return
the
impulses
was
an
awful
job
and
one
that
is
half
done
yet
we
see
things
after
a
fashion
and
at
a
distance
of
a
few
kilometers
by
sending
an
almost
parallel
wave
from
a
to
disintegrate
and
double
back
the
viewing
wave
that
the
way
the
lookout
plates
and
lenses
work
all
over
the
ship
from
the
in
the
control
room
to
the
plates
of
the
staterooms
and
lifeboats
and
the
of
the
promenades
but
the
whole
system
is
a
rotten
makeshift
and
just
a
minute
exclaimed
the
girl
i
and
everybody
else
have
been
thinking
that
everything
is
absolutely
perfect
and
yet
every
single
thing
you
have
talked
about
you
have
ended
up
by
describing
as
or
a
you
speak
as
though
the
entire
system
were
a
poor
thing
that
will
have
to
do
until
something
better
has
been
found
and
that
nobody
knows
anything
about
anything
how
do
you
get
that
way
by
working
with
brandon
and
westfall
those
birds
have
got
real
brains
and
they
on
the
track
of
something
that
will
in
all
probability
be
as
far
ahead
of
roeser
rays
as
our
present
system
is
ahead
of
the
science
of
the
seventeenth
century
really
she
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
tell
me
about
it
ca
be
done
he
refused
i
do
know
much
about
it
even
they
did
know
any
too
much
about
some
of
it
when
i
had
to
come
in
and
what
little
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
because
it
is
mine
but
you
working
with
them
are
you
yes
in
the
sense
that
a
small
boy
helps
his
father
build
a
house
they
the
brains
i
simply
do
some
figuring
that
they
do
want
to
waste
time
doing
nadia
having
no
belief
whatever
in
his
modest
disclaimer
but
in
secret
greatly
pleased
by
his
attitude
replied
of
course
you
could
say
anything
about
an
unfinished
project
i
should
have
asked
where
do
we
go
from
here
down
the
lining
of
the
hull
outside
the
passengers
quarters
to
the
upper
dirigible
projectors
and
he
led
the
way
down
a
series
of
steep
steel
stairways
through
bulkheads
and
partitions
of
steel
one
thing
i
forgot
to
tell
you
about
the
detectors
they
worked
on
the
same
principle
as
the
lights
and
are
just
about
as
efficient
instead
of
light
though
they
send
out
cones
of
electromagnetic
waves
which
set
up
induced
currents
in
any
conductor
encountered
beyond
our
own
shell
since
all
dangerous
meteorites
have
been
shown
to
contain
conducting
material
that
is
enough
to
locate
them
for
radio
finders
automatically
determine
the
direction
distance
and
magnitude
of
the
disturbance
and
swing
a
light
on
it
that
was
what
happened
when
that
light
swung
toward
us
back
there
in
the
prow
are
there
any
of
those
that
i
heard
discussed
so
much
lately
near
here
asked
the
girl
lots
of
here
one
right
here
and
at
the
next
landing
he
opened
a
steel
door
snapped
on
a
light
and
waved
his
hand
you
ca
see
much
of
it
from
here
but
it
a
complete
in
itself
capable
of
maintaining
a
dozen
or
fifteen
persons
during
a
cruise
in
space
why
is
it
a
good
idea
to
retain
them
accidents
are
still
possible
are
they
not
of
course
and
there
is
no
question
of
doing
away
with
them
entirely
modern
ships
however
have
only
enough
of
them
to
take
care
of
the
largest
number
of
persons
ever
to
be
carried
by
the
vessel
has
the
more
than
she
needs
i
say
she
has
and
more
of
everything
else
except
room
for
i
heard
them
talking
about
junking
her
i
think
it
a
shame
so
do
i
in
a
way
you
see
i
helped
design
her
and
her
the
which
brandon
and
westfall
are
using
as
a
floating
laboratory
but
times
change
and
the
inefficient
must
go
she
a
good
old
tub
but
she
was
built
when
everybody
was
afraid
of
space
and
we
had
to
put
every
safety
factor
into
her
that
we
could
think
of
as
a
result
she
is
four
times
as
heavy
as
she
should
be
and
that
takes
a
lot
of
extra
power
her
skin
is
too
thick
she
has
too
many
batteries
of
accumulators
too
many
too
many
bulkheads
and
too
many
and
too
much
of
everything
she
is
so
built
that
if
she
should
break
up
out
in
space
nobody
would
die
if
they
lived
through
the
shock
there
are
so
many
bulkheads
and
that
no
matter
how
many
pieces
she
broke
up
into
the
survivors
would
find
themselves
in
something
able
to
navigate
that
excessive
construction
is
no
longer
necessary
modern
ships
carry
ten
times
the
on
of
the
power
that
this
old
uses
even
though
she
only
four
years
old
she
a
relic
of
the
days
when
we
used
to
slam
through
on
the
ecliptic
route
right
through
all
the
meteoric
stuff
that
is
always
there
trusting
to
heavy
armor
to
ward
off
anything
too
small
for
the
observers
and
detectors
to
locate
now
with
the
observatories
and
out
in
space
fairly
light
armor
is
sufficient
as
we
route
ourselves
well
away
from
the
ecliptic
and
so
miss
all
the
heavy
stuff
so
badly
as
i
hate
to
see
her
go
there
the
old
tub
is
bound
for
the
a
few
more
flights
of
stairs
brought
them
to
the
upper
band
of
dirigible
projectors
which
encircled
the
hull
outside
the
passengers
quarters
some
sixty
feet
below
the
prow
they
were
heavy
affairs
mounted
upon
massive
universal
bearings
free
to
turn
in
any
direction
and
each
having
its
converter
nestling
inside
its
prodigious
field
of
force
stevens
explained
that
these
projectors
were
used
in
turning
the
vessel
and
in
dodging
meteorites
when
necessary
and
they
went
on
through
another
almost
invisible
door
into
a
hall
and
took
an
elevator
down
to
the
main
corridor
well
you
seen
it
miss
newton
stevens
said
regretfully
as
he
led
her
toward
the
captain
office
the
lower
half
is
full
of
heavy
stuff
accumulators
machinery
driving
projectors
and
such
junk
so
that
the
center
of
gravity
is
below
the
center
of
action
of
the
driving
projectors
that
makes
stable
flight
possible
it
all
more
or
less
like
what
we
just
seen
and
i
do
suppose
you
want
to
miss
the
dance
anyway
a
lot
of
people
want
to
dance
with
you
would
you
just
as
soon
show
me
through
the
lower
half
as
dance
rather
lots
so
would
i
can
dance
any
time
and
i
want
to
see
everything
let
go
down
they
went
past
battery
after
battery
of
accumulators
climbing
over
and
around
the
number
of
huge
steel
girders
and
bracers
through
mazes
of
heavily
insulated
wiring
and
conduits
past
mass
after
mass
of
automatic
machinery
which
stevens
explained
to
his
eager
listener
they
inspected
one
of
the
great
driving
projectors
which
built
rigidly
parallel
to
the
axis
of
the
ship
and
held
immovably
in
place
by
enormous
trusses
of
steel
revealed
neither
to
the
eye
nor
to
the
ear
any
sign
of
the
terrific
force
it
was
exerting
still
lower
they
went
until
the
girl
had
been
shown
everything
even
down
to
the
bottom
and
stern
braces
tired
stevens
asked
as
the
inspection
was
completed
not
very
it
been
quite
a
climb
but
i
had
a
wonderful
time
so
have
i
he
declared
positively
i
know
what
we
crawl
up
into
one
of
these
stern
lifeboats
and
make
us
a
cup
of
coffee
before
we
climb
back
with
me
ahead
of
you
nadia
accepted
the
invitation
enthusiastically
and
they
made
their
way
to
the
nearest
of
the
miniature
here
although
no
emergency
had
been
encountered
in
all
the
four
years
of
the
vessel
life
they
found
everything
in
readiness
and
the
two
soon
had
prepared
and
eaten
a
hearty
luncheon
well
i
ca
think
of
any
more
excuses
for
monopolizing
you
miss
newton
so
i
suppose
i
have
to
take
you
back
believe
me
enjoyed
this
more
than
you
can
realize
i
he
broke
off
and
listened
every
nerve
taut
what
was
that
he
exclaimed
what
was
what
i
did
hear
anything
something
screwy
somewhere
i
felt
a
vibration
and
anything
make
this
mountain
of
steel
even
quiver
must
have
given
us
one
nudge
there
another
the
girl
painfully
tense
felt
only
a
barely
perceptible
tremor
but
the
computer
knowing
far
better
than
she
the
inconceivable
strength
and
mass
of
that
enormous
structure
of
solidly
braced
hardened
steel
sprang
into
action
leaping
to
the
small
dirigible
plate
he
turned
on
the
power
and
swung
it
upward
great
suffering
snakes
he
ejaculated
then
stood
mute
for
the
plate
revealed
a
terrible
sight
the
entire
nose
of
the
gigantic
craft
had
been
sheared
off
in
two
immense
slices
as
though
clipped
off
by
a
gigantic
sword
and
even
as
they
stared
fascinated
at
the
sight
the
severed
slices
were
drifting
slowly
away
swinging
the
view
along
the
plane
of
cleavage
stevens
made
out
a
relatively
tiny
ball
of
metal
only
fifty
feet
or
so
in
diameter
at
a
distance
of
perhaps
a
mile
from
this
ball
there
shot
a
blinding
plane
of
light
and
the
fell
apart
at
the
midsection
the
lower
half
separating
clean
from
the
upper
portion
which
held
the
passengers
leaving
the
upper
half
intact
the
attacker
began
slicing
the
lower
driving
half
into
thin
sections
as
that
incandescent
plane
of
destruction
made
its
first
flashing
cut
through
the
body
of
the
accompanied
by
an
additional
pyrotechnic
display
of
severed
and
leads
stevens
and
nadia
suddenly
found
themselves
floating
weightless
in
the
air
of
the
room
still
gripping
the
controls
of
the
plate
stevens
caught
the
girl
with
one
hand
drew
her
down
beside
him
and
held
her
motionless
while
his
keen
mind
flashed
over
all
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
and
planned
his
course
of
action
they
apparently
slicing
us
pretty
evenly
and
by
the
looks
of
things
one
cut
is
coming
right
about
here
he
explained
rapidly
as
he
found
a
flashlight
and
drew
his
companion
through
the
door
and
along
a
narrow
passage
soon
he
opened
another
door
and
led
her
into
a
tiny
compartment
so
low
that
they
could
not
stand
upright
a
mere
cubicle
of
steel
carefully
closing
the
door
he
fingered
dials
upon
each
of
the
walls
of
the
cell
then
folded
himself
up
into
a
comfortable
position
instructed
nadia
to
do
the
same
and
snapped
off
the
light
please
leave
it
on
the
shaken
girl
asked
it
so
ghastly
we
better
save
it
nadia
he
advised
pressing
her
arm
reassuringly
it
the
only
light
we
got
and
we
may
need
it
worse
later
on
its
life
is
limited
you
know
later
on
do
you
think
we
need
anything
later
on
sure
of
course
they
may
get
us
nadia
but
this
little
tertiary
is
a
mighty
small
target
for
them
to
hit
and
if
they
miss
us
as
i
think
they
will
there
a
larger
room
opening
off
each
wall
of
this
one
at
least
one
of
which
will
certainly
be
left
intact
from
any
one
of
those
rooms
we
can
reach
a
of
course
it
a
little
too
much
to
expect
that
any
one
of
the
will
be
left
whole
but
they
bulkheaded
too
you
know
so
that
we
can
be
sure
of
finding
something
able
to
navigate
providing
we
can
make
our
believe
me
ace
i
sure
glad
we
aboard
the
old
right
now
with
all
her
instead
of
on
one
of
the
modern
liners
we
be
sunk
right
i
felt
sunk
enough
for
a
minute
i
feeling
better
now
though
since
you
are
taking
it
so
calmly
sure
why
not
a
man
not
dead
until
his
heart
stops
beating
you
know
our
turn
come
next
when
they
let
up
a
little
but
suppose
they
change
the
width
of
their
slices
and
hit
this
cubby
small
as
it
is
it
be
just
too
bad
he
shrugged
in
that
case
we
never
know
what
hit
us
so
it
no
good
worrying
about
it
but
say
we
might
do
something
at
that
if
they
did
hit
us
square
i
can
move
fairly
fast
and
might
be
able
to
get
a
door
open
before
the
loss
of
pressure
seals
it
we
light
the
flash
here
you
hold
it
so
that
i
can
have
both
hands
free
put
both
arms
around
me
just
under
the
arms
and
stick
to
me
like
a
porous
plaster
because
if
i
have
to
move
at
all
i
have
to
jump
like
chain
lightning
shine
the
beam
right
over
there
so
reflect
and
light
up
all
the
dials
at
once
there
hold
on
tight
here
they
come
as
he
spoke
a
jarring
shudder
shook
one
side
of
their
then
a
moment
later
the
phenomenon
was
repeated
but
with
much
less
force
upon
the
other
side
stevens
sighed
with
relief
took
the
light
and
extinguished
it
missed
us
clean
he
exulted
now
if
they
do
find
us
we
all
set
how
can
they
possibly
find
us
i
seem
to
be
always
worried
about
the
wrong
things
but
i
should
think
that
their
finding
us
would
be
the
least
of
our
troubles
do
judge
their
vision
system
by
ours
they
got
everything
apparently
however
their
apparatus
may
not
be
delicate
enough
to
spot
us
in
a
space
this
small
when
their
projectors
flash
through
it
as
they
probably
will
then
too
there
a
couple
of
other
big
items
in
our
favor
nobody
else
is
in
the
entire
lower
half
since
all
this
machinery
down
here
is
either
automatic
or
else
controlled
from
up
above
so
they
wo
be
expecting
to
see
anybody
when
they
get
down
this
far
and
we
are
at
all
conspicuous
we
both
dressed
in
gray
your
clothes
in
particular
are
almost
exactly
the
color
of
this
so
altogether
we
stand
a
good
chance
of
being
missed
what
shall
we
do
now
nothing
whatever
wish
we
could
sleep
for
a
couple
of
hours
but
of
course
there
no
hope
of
that
stretch
out
here
like
that
you
rest
folded
up
like
an
accordion
and
i
lie
down
diagonally
across
the
room
there
just
room
for
me
that
way
that
one
advantage
of
weightlessness
you
can
lie
down
standing
on
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
and
like
it
but
i
forgot
you
never
been
weightless
before
have
you
does
it
make
you
sick
not
so
much
now
except
that
i
feel
awfully
weird
inside
i
was
horribly
dizzy
and
nauseated
at
first
but
it
going
away
that
good
it
makes
lots
of
people
pretty
sick
in
fact
some
folks
get
awfully
sick
and
ca
seem
to
get
used
to
it
at
all
it
the
canals
in
the
inner
ear
that
do
most
of
it
you
know
however
if
as
well
as
that
already
you
be
a
regular
spacehound
in
half
an
hour
i
been
weightless
for
weeks
at
a
stretch
out
in
the
and
now
i
got
so
i
really
like
it
here
we
better
keep
in
touch
he
found
her
hand
and
tucked
it
under
his
arm
stabilize
our
positions
more
besides
keeping
us
from
getting
too
lonesome
here
in
the
dark
he
concluded
in
a
voice
thanks
for
saying
but
you
would
would
you
and
a
wave
of
admiration
went
through
her
for
the
real
and
chivalrous
manhood
of
the
man
with
whom
she
had
been
forced
by
circumstances
to
cast
her
lot
how
long
must
we
stay
here
as
long
as
the
air
lasts
and
i
like
to
stay
here
longer
than
that
we
do
want
to
move
around
any
more
than
we
absolutely
have
to
until
their
rays
are
off
of
us
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
long
that
will
be
also
we
better
keep
still
i
do
know
what
kind
of
an
audio
system
they
got
but
there
no
use
taking
unnecessary
chances
all
x
i
an
oyster
little
sister
and
for
many
minutes
the
two
remained
motionless
and
silent
now
and
then
nadia
twitched
and
started
at
some
vague
real
or
imaginary
sound
now
and
then
her
fingers
tightened
upon
his
biceps
and
he
pressed
her
hand
with
his
great
arm
in
reassurance
and
understanding
once
a
wall
of
their
cell
resounded
under
the
impact
of
a
fierce
blow
and
stevens
instantly
threw
his
arm
around
the
girl
twisting
himself
between
her
and
the
threatened
wall
ready
for
any
emergency
but
nothing
more
happened
the
door
remained
closed
the
cell
stayed
and
time
wore
slowly
on
all
too
soon
the
unmistakable
symptoms
of
breathing
an
unfit
atmosphere
made
themselves
apparent
and
stevens
after
testing
each
of
the
doors
drew
the
girl
into
a
larger
room
where
they
breathed
deeply
of
the
fresh
cool
air
how
did
you
know
that
this
room
was
whole
asked
nadia
we
might
have
stepped
out
into
space
might
we
no
if
this
room
had
lost
its
tightness
the
door
would
have
opened
they
wo
open
if
there
a
difference
of
one
kilogram
pressure
on
the
two
sides
that
how
i
knew
that
the
room
we
were
in
at
first
was
cut
in
two
the
door
into
that
would
move
what
comes
next
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
do
we
better
hold
a
little
council
of
war
they
may
have
gone
stevens
broke
off
as
the
structure
began
to
move
and
they
settled
down
upon
what
had
been
one
of
the
greater
and
greater
became
the
acceleration
until
their
apparent
weight
was
almost
as
much
as
it
would
have
been
upon
the
earth
at
which
point
it
became
constant
but
they
have
he
continued
the
interrupted
sentence
this
seems
to
be
a
capture
and
seizure
as
well
as
an
attack
so
we
have
to
take
the
risk
of
looking
at
them
besides
it
getting
cold
in
here
one
or
two
of
the
adjoining
cells
have
apparently
been
ruptured
and
we
radiating
our
heat
out
into
space
so
we
have
to
get
into
a
or
freeze
i
go
pick
out
the
best
one
wonder
if
i
better
take
you
with
me
or
hide
you
and
come
back
after
you
do
worry
about
that
i
coming
with
you
nadia
declared
positively
just
as
well
probably
he
assented
and
they
set
out
a
thorough
exploration
of
all
the
tight
connecting
cells
revealed
that
not
a
lifeboat
within
their
reach
remained
intact
but
that
habitable
and
navigable
portions
of
three
such
craft
were
available
selecting
the
most
completely
equipped
of
these
they
took
up
their
residence
therein
by
entering
it
and
closing
the
massive
insulating
door
stevens
disconnected
all
the
lights
save
one
and
so
shielded
that
one
before
turning
it
on
that
it
merely
lightened
the
utter
darkness
into
a
gloom
he
then
stepped
up
to
the
lookout
plate
and
with
his
hand
upon
the
control
pondered
long
the
possible
consequences
of
what
he
wished
to
do
what
harm
would
it
do
to
take
just
a
little
peek
i
do
know
that
the
dickens
of
it
maybe
none
and
then
again
maybe
a
lot
you
see
we
do
know
who
or
what
we
are
up
against
the
only
thing
we
know
is
that
they
got
us
beat
a
hundred
ways
and
got
to
act
accordingly
we
got
to
chance
it
sometime
though
if
we
can
ever
get
away
so
we
might
as
well
do
it
now
i
put
it
on
very
short
range
first
and
see
what
we
can
see
by
the
small
number
of
cells
we
got
here
i
afraid
they
split
us
up
lengthwise
too
so
that
instead
of
having
a
whole
slice
of
the
old
watermelon
to
live
in
got
only
about
a
sixth
of
one
shaped
about
like
a
piece
of
restaurant
pie
one
thing
i
can
do
though
i
turn
on
the
communicator
receiver
and
put
it
on
full
coverage
maybe
we
can
hear
something
useful
putting
a
little
power
upon
the
visiray
plate
he
moved
the
point
of
projection
a
short
distance
from
their
so
that
the
plate
showed
a
view
of
the
wreckage
the
upper
half
of
the
vessel
was
still
intact
the
lower
half
a
jumble
of
fragments
from
each
of
the
larger
pieces
a
brilliant
ray
of
tangible
force
stretched
outward
suddenly
their
receiver
sounded
behind
them
as
the
transmitter
in
the
telegraph
room
tried
to
notify
headquarters
of
their
plight
attacked
and
cut
up
being
taken
tow
rapidly
as
the
message
was
uttered
the
transmitter
died
with
a
rattle
in
the
middle
of
a
word
and
nadia
looked
at
stevens
with
foreboding
in
her
eyes
they
got
something
that
one
thing
sure
to
be
able
to
neutralize
our
communicator
beams
that
way
he
admitted
not
so
good
we
have
to
play
this
close
to
our
vests
girl
are
you
just
trying
to
cheer
me
up
or
do
you
really
think
we
have
a
chance
she
demanded
i
want
to
know
just
where
we
stand
i
coming
clean
with
you
no
kidding
if
we
can
get
away
we
be
all
x
because
i
bet
a
farm
that
by
this
time
brandon
got
everything
those
birds
have
and
maybe
more
they
beat
us
to
it
that
all
kind
of
afraid
though
that
getting
away
is
going
to
be
quite
as
simple
as
shooting
fish
down
a
well
far
ahead
of
them
a
port
opened
a
lifeboat
shot
out
at
its
full
power
and
again
their
receiver
tried
to
burst
into
sound
but
it
was
a
vain
attempt
the
sound
died
before
one
complete
word
could
be
uttered
and
the
lifeboat
its
power
completely
neutralized
by
the
rays
of
the
tiny
craft
of
the
enemy
floated
gently
back
toward
the
mass
of
its
parent
and
accompanied
it
in
its
headlong
flight
several
more
lifeboats
made
the
attempt
as
the
courageous
officers
of
the
some
of
whom
had
apparently
succeeded
in
eluding
the
vigilance
of
the
captors
launched
the
little
shells
from
various
ports
but
as
each
boat
issued
its
power
was
neutralized
and
it
found
itself
dragged
helplessly
along
in
the
grip
of
one
of
those
mysterious
brilliant
rays
of
force
at
least
one
hidden
officer
must
have
been
watching
the
fruitless
efforts
for
the
next
lifeboat
to
issue
made
no
attempt
either
to
talk
or
to
flee
but
from
it
there
flamed
out
into
space
a
concentrated
beam
of
destruction
the
terrible
ray
of
annihilation
against
which
no
known
substance
could
endure
for
a
moment
the
ray
which
had
definitely
outlawed
war
but
even
that
frightful
weapon
was
useless
it
spent
its
force
harmlessly
upon
an
impalpable
invisible
barrier
a
hundred
yards
from
its
source
and
the
bold
lifeboat
disappeared
in
one
blinding
explosion
of
incandescence
as
the
captor
showed
its
real
power
in
retaliation
stevens
jaw
leaped
from
the
screen
then
brought
himself
up
so
quickly
that
he
skated
across
the
smooth
steel
floor
shutting
off
the
lookout
plate
he
led
the
girl
across
the
room
to
a
comfortable
seat
and
sat
down
beside
her
raging
but
thoughtful
nadia
soon
recovered
why
are
you
acting
so
contrary
to
your
nature
is
it
because
of
she
demanded
a
dozen
times
i
seen
you
start
to
do
something
and
then
change
your
mind
i
be
a
load
on
you
nor
hinder
you
in
anything
you
want
to
do
i
told
your
father
i
look
after
you
and
i
going
to
do
it
he
replied
indirectly
i
would
do
it
anyway
of
course
even
if
you
are
ten
or
twelve
years
older
than
i
thought
you
were
yes
dad
never
has
realized
that
i
more
than
eight
years
old
i
see
you
were
going
out
there
and
be
slaughtered
he
flushed
but
made
no
reply
in
that
case
i
glad
i
here
that
would
have
been
silly
i
think
we
better
hold
that
council
of
war
you
mentioned
a
while
ago
do
you
i
need
a
smoke
do
you
indulge
no
thanks
i
tried
it
a
few
times
at
school
but
never
liked
it
he
searched
his
pockets
bringing
to
light
an
unopened
package
and
a
tattered
remnant
which
proved
to
contain
one
dilapidated
cigarette
he
studied
it
thoughtfully
i
smoke
this
wreck
he
decided
while
it
still
smokable
we
save
the
rest
of
them
i
afraid
it
be
a
long
time
between
smokes
well
let
confer
this
will
have
to
be
a
conference
i
do
imagine
that
any
of
my
ideas
will
prove
particularly
helpful
you
talk
and
i
listen
you
ca
tell
what
ideas
may
be
useful
chip
in
any
time
you
feel
the
urge
here
the
dope
as
i
see
it
they
highly
intelligent
creatures
and
are
in
all
probability
neither
martians
nor
venerians
if
any
of
them
had
any
such
stuff
as
that
some
of
us
would
have
known
about
it
and
besides
i
do
believe
they
would
have
used
it
in
just
that
way
mercury
is
not
habitable
at
least
for
organic
beings
and
we
have
never
seen
any
sign
of
any
other
kind
of
inhabitants
who
could
work
with
metals
and
rays
they
probably
from
jupiter
although
possibly
from
further
away
i
say
jupiter
because
i
would
think
judging
from
the
small
size
of
the
ship
that
it
may
still
be
in
the
experimental
stage
so
that
they
probably
did
come
from
any
further
away
than
jupiter
then
too
if
they
were
very
numerous
somebody
would
have
sighted
one
before
i
give
my
left
leg
and
four
fingers
for
one
good
look
at
the
inside
of
that
ship
why
did
you
take
it
then
you
never
even
looked
toward
it
after
that
one
first
glimpse
i
say
i
did
the
reason
being
that
they
may
have
automatic
detectors
and
as
i
have
suggested
before
our
system
of
vision
is
so
crude
that
its
use
could
be
detected
with
a
clothesline
or
a
basket
full
of
scrap
iron
but
to
resume
their
aim
is
to
capture
not
destroy
since
they
have
killed
anybody
except
the
one
crew
that
attacked
them
apparently
they
want
to
study
us
or
something
however
they
intend
that
any
of
us
shall
get
away
nor
even
send
out
a
word
of
what
has
happened
to
us
therefore
it
looks
as
though
our
best
bet
is
to
hide
now
and
try
to
sneak
away
on
them
after
a
while
direct
methods
work
right
you
sound
lucid
is
there
any
possibility
of
getting
back
though
if
we
got
anywhere
near
jupiter
it
so
far
away
it
a
long
stretch
from
jupiter
to
any
of
the
planets
where
we
have
all
right
particularly
now
when
mars
and
tellus
are
subtending
an
angle
of
something
more
than
ninety
degrees
at
the
sun
and
venus
is
between
the
two
while
jupiter
is
clear
across
the
sun
from
all
three
of
them
even
when
jupiter
is
in
mean
opposition
to
mars
it
is
still
some
five
hundred
and
fifty
million
kilometers
away
so
you
can
form
some
idea
as
to
how
far
it
is
from
our
nearest
planet
now
no
if
we
expect
to
get
back
under
our
own
power
we
got
to
break
away
pretty
quick
these
lifeboats
have
very
little
accumulator
capacity
and
the
receptors
are
useless
above
about
three
hundred
million
kilometers
but
it
take
us
a
long
time
to
go
that
far
wo
it
not
very
our
own
ships
using
only
the
acceleration
of
gravity
and
both
plus
and
minus
at
that
make
the
better
than
four
hundred
million
kilometers
of
the
long
route
to
mars
in
five
days
these
birds
are
using
almost
that
much
acceleration
and
i
do
see
how
they
do
it
they
must
have
a
tractor
ray
brandon
claimed
that
such
a
thing
was
theoretically
possible
but
westfall
and
i
could
see
it
we
ragged
him
about
it
a
lot
and
he
was
right
i
thought
of
course
they
drift
with
us
but
they
are
using
power
steadily
they
got
system
suppose
they
could
be
using
energy
we
were
taught
that
it
was
impossible
but
you
shattered
a
lot
of
my
knowledge
today
i
would
want
to
say
definitely
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
but
the
deeper
we
go
into
that
line
the
more
unlikely
energy
become
no
they
got
a
real
system
one
that
can
hold
a
tight
beam
together
a
lot
farther
than
anything
we
have
been
able
to
develop
that
all
well
we
given
them
quite
a
lot
of
time
to
get
over
any
suspicion
of
us
let
see
if
we
can
sneak
away
from
them
by
short
and
infrequent
applications
of
power
to
the
dirigible
projectors
of
the
stevens
slowly
shifted
the
position
of
the
fragment
which
bore
their
craft
until
it
was
well
clear
of
the
other
components
of
the
mass
of
wreckage
he
then
exerted
a
very
small
retarding
force
so
that
their
bit
would
lag
behind
the
procession
as
though
it
had
accidently
been
separated
but
the
crew
of
the
captor
was
alert
and
no
sooner
did
a
clear
space
show
itself
between
them
and
the
mass
than
a
ray
picked
them
up
and
herded
them
back
into
place
stevens
then
nudged
other
pieces
so
that
they
fell
out
only
to
see
them
also
rounded
up
hour
after
hour
he
kept
trying
doing
nothing
sufficiently
energetic
to
create
any
suspicion
but
attempting
everything
he
could
think
of
that
offered
any
chance
of
escape
from
the
clutches
of
their
captors
immovable
at
the
plate
his
hands
upon
the
controls
he
performed
every
insidious
maneuver
his
agile
brain
could
devise
but
he
could
not
succeed
in
separating
their
vehicle
from
its
fellows
finally
after
a
last
attempt
which
was
foiled
as
easily
as
were
its
predecessors
he
shut
off
his
controls
and
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
grin
i
did
think
i
could
get
away
with
it
they
keen
that
gang
but
i
had
to
keep
at
it
as
long
as
it
would
have
done
us
any
good
would
it
do
us
any
good
now
not
a
bit
we
going
so
fast
that
we
could
stop
we
out
of
even
radio
range
of
our
closest
we
have
to
put
off
any
more
attempts
until
they
slow
us
down
they
fairly
close
to
at
least
one
of
the
moons
of
jupiter
we
have
our
best
chance
so
good
in
fact
that
i
really
think
we
can
make
it
but
what
good
would
that
do
us
if
we
could
get
back
dire
foreboding
showed
in
her
glorious
eyes
lots
of
things
not
tried
yet
girl
and
we
try
them
all
first
we
get
away
second
we
try
to
get
in
touch
with
norman
brandon
how
no
known
radio
will
carry
half
that
far
no
but
i
think
that
a
radio
as
yet
unknown
may
be
able
to
and
there
is
a
bare
possibility
that
i
be
able
to
communicate
oh
wonderful
that
lifts
a
frightful
load
off
my
mind
she
breathed
but
just
a
minute
i
said
i
come
clean
with
you
and
i
will
the
odds
are
all
against
us
no
matter
what
we
do
if
that
unknown
radio
work
and
it
probably
wo
there
are
several
other
things
we
can
try
but
they
all
pretty
slim
chances
even
if
we
get
away
it
probably
be
about
the
same
thing
as
though
you
were
to
be
marooned
on
a
desert
island
without
any
tools
and
with
your
rescue
depending
upon
your
ability
to
build
a
radio
station
with
which
to
call
to
a
mainland
for
help
however
if
we
do
try
to
get
away
our
only
alternative
is
letting
them
know
we
here
and
joining
our
friends
in
captivity
and
then
what
you
know
as
much
as
i
do
imprisonment
and
restraint
certain
death
possible
return
to
earth
almost
certainly
impossible
life
as
guests
highly
improbable
i
with
you
steve
all
the
way
well
it
time
to
spring
off
we
both
been
awake
better
than
fifty
hours
personally
i
all
in
and
you
so
near
dead
that
you
a
physical
wreck
we
get
us
a
bite
of
supper
and
turn
in
an
appetizing
supper
was
prepared
from
the
abundant
stores
and
each
ate
a
heartier
meal
than
either
would
have
believed
possible
stevens
considered
his
unopened
package
of
cigarettes
then
regretfully
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
still
unopened
and
turned
to
nadia
well
little
fellow
it
time
to
shove
off
and
then
some
you
might
as
well
sleep
here
and
i
go
in
there
if
anything
scares
you
yell
old
trapper
wait
a
minute
steve
nadia
flushed
and
her
brown
eyes
and
black
eyebrows
in
comparison
with
her
hair
lent
her
face
a
quizzical
elfin
expression
that
far
belied
her
feelings
as
she
stared
straight
into
his
eyes
i
never
even
been
away
from
the
earth
before
and
with
all
this
happening
i
simply
scared
to
death
been
trying
to
hide
it
but
i
could
stand
it
alone
and
we
going
to
be
together
too
long
and
too
close
for
senseless
conventions
to
affect
us
there
two
bunks
over
there
why
do
you
sleep
in
one
of
them
he
returned
her
steadfast
gaze
for
a
moment
in
silence
all
x
with
me
nadia
he
answered
keeping
out
of
his
voice
all
signs
of
the
tenderness
he
felt
for
her
and
of
his
very
real
admiration
for
her
straightforward
conduct
in
a
terrifying
situation
you
trust
me
then
you
do
be
silly
i
know
you
i
know
you
and
i
know
brandon
and
westfall
i
know
what
you
done
and
exactly
the
kind
of
men
you
are
you
thanks
old
and
promises
were
made
and
received
in
a
clasp
from
which
nadia
right
hand
strong
as
it
was
emerged
slightly
damaged
by
the
way
what
is
your
first
name
she
asked
in
lighter
vein
nobody
not
even
dad
or
breckie
ever
seems
to
call
you
anything
but
when
they
talk
about
you
she
was
amazed
at
the
effect
of
her
innocent
question
for
stevens
flushed
to
his
hair
and
spluttered
it
he
finally
snorted
percival
van
schravendyck
stevens
would
that
tear
it
why
i
think
percival
a
real
nice
name
silence
he
hissed
in
burlesque
style
young
woman
i
have
revealed
to
you
a
secret
known
to
but
few
living
creatures
on
your
life
keep
it
inviolate
oh
very
well
if
you
insist
steve
and
she
gave
him
a
radiant
and
honest
smile
the
first
smile
he
had
seen
since
the
moment
of
the
attack
chapter
iii
castaways
upon
ganymede
upon
awakening
the
man
first
care
was
to
instruct
the
girl
in
the
operation
of
the
projectors
so
that
she
could
keep
the
edge
of
their
small
section
which
she
had
promptly
christened
the
forlorn
hope
between
them
and
the
grinding
clashing
mass
of
wreckage
and
thus
if
it
should
become
necessary
protect
the
relatively
frail
inner
portions
of
their
craft
from
damage
keep
an
eye
on
things
for
a
while
nadia
he
instructed
as
soon
as
she
could
handle
the
controls
and
do
use
any
more
power
than
is
absolutely
necessary
we
need
it
all
and
besides
they
can
probably
detect
anything
we
can
use
there
probably
enough
leakage
from
the
ruptured
accumulator
cells
to
mask
quite
a
little
emission
but
use
much
i
going
to
see
what
i
can
do
about
making
this
whole
wedge
navigable
why
not
just
launch
what
left
of
this
lifeboat
it
is
it
yes
but
it
too
small
two
or
three
of
the
big
dirigible
projectors
of
the
lower
band
are
on
the
rim
of
this
section
we
riding
i
think
if
so
and
if
enough
batteries
of
accumulators
are
left
intact
to
give
them
anywhere
nearly
full
power
we
can
get
an
acceleration
that
will
make
a
lifeboat
look
sick
those
main
dirigibles
you
know
are
able
to
swing
the
whole
mass
of
the
and
what
they
do
to
this
one
chunk
of
it
we
got
only
a
few
thousand
tons
of
mass
in
this
piece
will
be
something
pretty
also
having
the
metal
may
save
us
months
of
time
in
mining
it
he
found
the
projectors
repaired
or
cut
out
the
damaged
accumulator
cells
and
reconnected
them
through
the
controls
of
the
lifeboat
he
moved
into
the
the
airtanks
stores
and
equipment
from
all
the
other
fragments
which
by
means
of
a
he
could
reach
without
too
much
difficulty
from
the
battery
rooms
of
those
fragments
open
shelves
after
being
sliced
open
by
the
shearing
ray
he
helped
himself
to
banks
of
accumulator
cells
from
the
enormous
driving
batteries
of
the
bolting
them
down
and
connecting
them
solidly
until
almost
every
compartment
of
their
craft
was
one
mass
of
energy
days
fled
like
hours
so
furiously
busy
were
they
in
preparing
their
peculiar
vessel
for
a
cruise
of
indefinite
duration
stevens
cut
himself
short
on
sleep
and
snatched
his
meals
in
passing
and
nadia
when
not
busy
at
her
own
tasks
of
observing
housekeeping
and
doing
what
little
piloting
was
required
was
rapidly
learning
to
wield
most
effectively
the
spanner
and
pliers
of
the
mechanic
and
electrician
i
afraid
our
time
is
getting
short
steve
she
announced
after
making
an
observation
it
looks
as
though
we
getting
wherever
it
is
we
going
well
i
got
only
two
more
jobs
to
do
but
they
the
hardest
of
the
lot
it
is
jupiter
or
can
you
tell
yet
jupiter
or
one
of
its
satellites
i
think
from
the
point
where
they
reversed
their
power
here
the
observation
you
told
me
to
take
looks
like
jupiter
he
agreed
after
he
had
rapidly
checked
her
figures
we
pass
very
close
to
one
of
those
two
satellites
probably
ganymede
which
is
fine
for
our
scheme
all
four
of
the
major
satellites
have
water
and
atmosphere
but
ganymede
being
largest
is
best
for
our
purposes
we
got
a
couple
of
days
yet
just
about
time
to
finish
up
let
get
going
you
know
what
to
do
steve
i
afraid
of
it
it
too
dangerous
is
there
some
other
way
none
that
i
can
see
the
close
watch
they
keeping
on
every
bit
of
this
junk
makes
it
our
only
chance
for
a
i
pretty
sure
i
can
do
it
but
if
i
should
happen
to
get
nipped
just
use
enough
power
to
let
them
know
you
here
and
you
wo
be
any
worse
off
than
if
i
had
tried
to
pull
off
this
stunt
he
donned
a
filled
a
looped
belt
with
tools
picked
up
a
portable
and
stepped
into
the
tiny
nadia
deftly
guided
their
segment
against
one
of
the
larger
fragments
and
held
it
there
with
a
gentle
steady
pressure
while
stevens
a
light
cable
paying
out
behind
him
clambered
carefully
over
the
wreckage
brought
his
drill
into
play
and
disappeared
inside
the
huge
wedge
in
less
than
an
hour
he
returned
without
mishap
and
reported
to
the
glowing
girl
just
like
shooting
fish
down
a
well
most
of
the
accumulator
cells
were
tight
and
installing
the
relays
was
a
bad
job
at
all
believe
me
girl
there
be
junk
filling
all
the
space
between
here
and
saturn
when
we
touch
them
off
wonderful
steve
nadia
exclaimed
it
wo
be
so
bad
seeing
you
go
into
the
others
now
that
you
have
this
one
all
rigged
up
around
and
around
the
mass
of
wreckage
they
crept
and
in
each
of
the
larger
sections
stevens
connected
up
the
enormous
fixed
or
dirigible
projectors
to
whatever
accumulator
cells
were
available
through
sensitive
relays
all
of
which
he
could
close
by
means
of
one
radio
impulse
the
long
and
dangerous
task
done
he
stood
at
the
lookout
plate
studying
the
huge
disk
which
had
been
the
upper
portion
of
the
lower
half
of
the
and
frowning
in
thought
nadia
reached
over
his
shoulder
and
switched
off
the
plate
nix
on
that
second
job
big
fellow
she
declared
they
are
really
necessary
and
you
altogether
too
apt
to
be
killed
trying
to
get
them
it
too
ghastly
i
wo
stand
for
your
trying
it
so
that
ends
it
we
ought
to
have
them
really
he
protested
with
those
special
tools
cutting
torches
and
all
the
stuff
we
be
sitting
pretty
we
lose
weeks
of
time
by
not
having
them
we
just
have
to
lose
it
then
you
ca
get
any
more
than
a
baby
can
get
the
moon
so
stop
crying
about
it
she
went
over
the
familiar
argument
for
the
twentieth
time
that
stuff
up
there
is
all
grinding
together
like
cakes
of
ice
in
a
floe
the
particular
section
you
want
is
in
plain
sight
of
whoever
is
on
watch
and
those
tools
and
things
are
altogether
too
heavy
to
handle
you
a
husky
brute
i
know
but
even
you
could
begin
to
handle
them
even
if
you
had
good
going
i
could
help
you
very
much
even
if
you
let
me
try
and
the
fact
that
you
so
positively
refuse
to
let
me
come
along
shows
how
dangerous
you
know
the
attempt
is
bound
to
be
you
probably
never
even
get
up
there
alive
to
say
nothing
of
getting
back
here
no
steve
that
out
like
a
light
i
sure
wish
they
left
us
weightless
for
a
while
sometime
if
only
for
an
hour
or
two
he
mourned
but
they
did
she
retorted
practically
so
we
just
out
of
luck
to
that
extent
our
time
is
about
up
too
it
time
you
worked
us
back
to
the
tail
end
of
this
procession
or
rather
the
head
end
since
traveling
now
stevens
took
the
controls
and
slowly
worked
along
the
outer
edge
of
the
mass
down
toward
its
extremity
nadia
put
one
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
he
glanced
around
thanks
steve
we
have
a
perfectly
wonderful
chance
as
it
is
and
gone
so
far
with
our
scheme
together
that
it
would
be
a
crying
shame
not
to
be
able
to
go
through
with
it
i
hate
like
sin
to
have
to
surrender
to
them
now
and
that
all
i
could
do
if
anything
should
become
of
you
besides
her
voice
died
away
into
silence
sure
you
right
he
hastily
replied
dodging
the
implication
of
that
unfinished
sentence
i
could
figure
out
anything
that
looked
particularly
feasible
anyway
that
why
i
did
try
it
we
pass
it
up
soon
they
arrived
at
their
objective
and
maintained
a
position
well
in
the
van
but
not
sufficiently
far
ahead
of
the
rest
to
call
forth
a
restraining
ray
from
their
captors
already
strongly
affected
by
the
gravitational
pull
of
the
mass
of
the
satellite
many
of
the
smaller
portions
of
the
wreck
not
directly
held
by
the
tractors
began
to
separate
from
the
main
mass
as
each
bit
left
its
place
another
beam
leaped
out
until
it
became
apparent
that
no
more
were
available
and
stevens
strapped
the
girl
and
himself
down
before
two
lookout
plates
now
for
it
nadia
he
exclaimed
and
simultaneously
threw
on
the
power
of
his
own
projectors
and
sent
out
the
radio
impulse
which
closed
the
relays
he
had
so
carefully
set
they
were
thrown
against
the
restraining
straps
savagely
and
held
there
by
an
enormous
weight
as
the
gigantic
dirigible
projectors
shot
their
fragment
of
the
wreck
away
from
the
comparatively
slight
force
which
had
been
acting
upon
it
but
they
braced
themselves
and
strained
their
muscles
in
order
to
watch
what
was
happening
as
the
relays
in
the
various
fragments
closed
the
massed
power
of
the
accumulators
was
shorted
dead
across
the
converters
and
projectors
instead
of
being
fed
into
them
gradually
through
the
controls
of
the
pilot
with
a
result
comparable
to
that
of
the
explosion
of
an
ammunition
dump
most
of
the
masses
whose
projectors
were
fed
by
comparatively
few
accumulator
cells
darted
away
entirely
with
a
stupendous
acceleration
a
few
of
them
however
received
the
unimpeded
flow
of
complete
batteries
those
projectors
tore
loose
from
even
their
massive
supports
and
crashed
through
anything
opposing
them
like
a
huge
projectile
it
was
a
spectacle
to
stagger
the
imagination
and
stevens
grinned
as
he
turned
to
the
girl
who
was
staring
in
amazement
well
ace
i
think
they
busy
enough
now
so
that
it
be
safe
to
take
that
look
at
their
controls
and
he
flashed
the
twin
beams
of
his
lookout
light
out
beyond
the
upper
half
of
the
only
to
see
them
stop
abruptly
in
even
the
extremely
short
of
roeser
rays
could
not
go
through
the
invisible
barrier
thrown
out
by
the
tiny
but
powerful
globe
of
space
no
penetration
nadia
asked
flattened
them
out
cold
as
the
fox
once
remarked
about
the
grapes
bet
they
sour
anyway
we
have
some
stuff
of
our
own
one
of
these
days
i
sure
hope
the
fireworks
we
started
back
there
keep
those
birds
amused
until
we
get
out
of
sight
because
if
i
use
much
more
power
on
these
projectors
we
may
not
have
juice
enough
left
to
stop
with
you
using
enough
now
to
suit
me
i
so
heavy
i
can
hardly
lift
a
finger
you
better
lift
you
must
watch
what
going
on
back
there
while
i
navigate
around
this
moon
all
x
chief
they
got
their
hands
full
apparently
those
rays
are
shooting
around
all
over
the
sky
it
looks
as
though
they
were
trying
to
capture
four
or
five
things
at
once
with
each
one
good
tell
me
when
the
moon
cuts
them
off
at
the
awful
acceleration
they
were
using
which
constantly
increased
the
terrific
velocity
with
which
they
had
been
traveling
when
they
made
good
their
escape
it
was
not
long
until
they
had
placed
the
satellite
between
them
and
the
enemy
then
stevens
cut
down
and
reversed
his
power
such
was
their
speed
however
that
a
long
detour
was
necessary
in
order
to
reduce
it
to
a
safe
landing
rate
as
soon
as
this
could
be
done
stevens
headed
for
the
morning
zone
and
dropped
the
hope
rapidly
toward
the
surface
of
that
new
strange
world
details
could
not
be
distinguished
at
first
because
of
an
layer
of
cloud
but
the
rising
sun
dispelled
the
mist
and
when
they
had
descended
to
within
a
few
thousand
feet
of
the
surface
their
vision
was
unobstructed
immediately
below
them
the
terrain
was
mountainous
and
heavily
wooded
while
far
to
the
east
the
rays
of
a
small
pale
sun
glinted
upon
a
vast
body
of
water
no
signs
of
habitation
were
visible
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
now
to
pick
out
a
location
for
our
we
must
have
a
waterfall
for
power
a
good
place
to
hide
our
ship
from
observation
and
i
like
to
have
a
little
seam
of
coal
we
can
use
wood
if
we
have
to
but
i
think
we
can
find
some
coal
this
is
all
sedimentary
rock
it
looks
a
lot
like
the
country
along
the
north
fork
of
the
flathead
in
montana
there
are
a
lot
of
coal
outcrops
usually
in
such
topography
as
this
is
we
want
to
hide
in
a
hurry
though
do
we
not
particularly
i
think
if
they
had
missed
us
at
all
they
would
have
had
us
long
ago
and
with
all
the
damage
we
did
with
those
projectors
they
wo
be
surprised
at
one
piece
being
missing
i
imagine
they
lost
a
good
many
but
they
know
that
somebody
caused
all
that
disturbance
wo
they
hunt
for
us
maybe
and
maybe
not
no
telling
what
they
do
however
by
the
time
they
can
land
and
get
checked
up
and
ready
to
hunt
for
us
we
be
a
mighty
small
needle
well
hidden
in
a
good
big
haystack
for
several
hours
they
roamed
over
the
mountainous
region
at
high
velocity
seeking
the
best
possible
location
and
finally
they
found
one
that
was
almost
ideal
a
narrow
canyon
overhung
with
heavy
trees
opening
into
a
wide
deep
gorge
upon
a
level
with
its
floor
a
mighty
waterfall
cascaded
into
the
gorge
just
above
the
canyon
and
here
and
there
could
be
seen
black
outcrops
which
stevens
after
a
close
scrutiny
declared
to
be
coal
he
deftly
guided
their
cumbersome
wedge
of
steel
into
the
retreat
allowed
it
to
settle
gently
to
the
ground
and
shut
off
the
power
well
little
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
jovians
i
do
know
just
where
we
are
but
wherever
it
is
we
here
we
got
away
clean
and
as
long
as
we
do
use
any
stuff
or
anything
else
that
they
can
trace
i
think
we
as
safe
as
money
in
a
bank
i
suppose
that
i
ought
to
be
scared
to
death
steve
but
i
not
just
too
thrilled
for
words
nadia
answered
and
the
eager
sparkle
in
her
eyes
bore
out
her
words
can
we
go
out
now
how
about
air
shall
we
wear
suits
or
go
out
as
we
are
have
you
got
a
weapon
of
any
kind
hurry
up
let
do
something
pipe
down
ace
remember
that
we
do
know
any
more
about
anything
around
here
than
a
pig
does
about
sunday
and
conduct
yourself
accordingly
take
it
easy
i
surprised
at
the
gravity
here
this
is
certainly
ganymede
and
it
has
a
diameter
of
only
about
fifty
seven
hundred
kilometers
if
i
remember
correctly
damoiseau
estimated
its
mass
at
about
three
that
of
the
earth
which
would
make
its
surface
gravity
about
however
it
is
actually
almost
a
half
as
you
see
by
this
here
therefore
it
is
quite
a
little
more
massive
than
has
been
what
of
it
let
go
places
and
do
things
calm
yourself
ginger
you
got
lots
of
time
we
be
here
for
quite
a
while
i
afraid
we
ca
go
out
until
we
analyze
the
air
sure
lucky
there
as
much
as
there
is
i
not
exactly
the
foremost
chemist
but
fortunately
an
is
much
of
a
job
with
the
apparatus
we
carry
while
nadia
controlled
her
impatience
as
best
she
could
stevens
manipulated
the
bulbs
and
pipettes
of
the
gas
apparatus
pressure
centimeters
more
than
i
dared
hope
for
and
analysis
all
x
i
believe
oxygen
concentration
a
little
high
but
not
much
we
wo
have
to
wear
the
then
not
unless
i
missed
something
in
the
analysis
the
pressure
corresponds
to
our
own
at
a
height
of
about
three
thousand
meters
which
we
can
get
used
to
without
too
much
trouble
good
thing
too
i
brought
along
all
the
air
i
could
get
hold
of
but
as
i
told
you
back
there
if
we
had
to
depend
on
it
altogether
we
might
be
out
of
luck
i
going
to
pump
some
of
our
air
back
into
a
cylinder
to
equalize
our
pressure
do
want
to
waste
any
of
it
until
we
sure
the
outside
air
suits
us
without
treatment
when
the
pressure
inside
had
been
gradually
reduced
to
that
outside
and
they
had
become
accustomed
to
breathing
the
rarefied
medium
stevens
opened
the
airlock
and
the
outside
doors
and
for
some
time
cautiously
sniffed
the
atmosphere
of
the
satellite
he
could
detect
nothing
harmful
or
unusual
in
it
it
was
apparently
the
same
as
earthly
air
and
he
became
jubilant
all
x
nadia
luck
is
perched
right
on
our
banner
freedom
air
water
power
and
coal
now
as
you
suggested
we
go
places
and
do
things
suppose
it
safe
her
first
eagerness
to
explore
their
surroundings
had
abated
noticeably
you
are
armed
are
you
no
and
i
do
believe
that
there
was
a
gun
of
any
kind
aboard
the
that
kind
of
thing
went
out
quite
a
while
ago
you
know
we
take
a
look
anyway
we
got
to
find
out
about
that
coal
before
we
decide
to
settle
down
here
remember
this
stuff
and
control
your
accordingly
leaping
lightly
to
the
ground
they
saw
that
the
severed
section
of
armor
which
was
the
rim
of
their
conveyance
almost
blocked
the
entrance
to
the
narrow
canyon
which
they
had
selected
for
their
retreat
upon
one
side
that
wall
of
steel
actually
touched
the
almost
perpendicular
wall
or
rock
upon
the
other
side
there
was
left
only
a
narrow
passage
they
stepped
through
it
so
that
they
could
see
the
waterfall
and
the
gorge
and
stopped
silent
the
sun
now
fairly
high
was
in
no
sense
the
familiar
orb
of
day
but
was
a
pale
insipid
thing
only
the
diameter
of
the
sun
to
which
they
were
accustomed
and
which
could
almost
be
studied
with
the
unshielded
eye
from
their
feet
a
grassy
meadow
a
few
hundred
feet
wide
sloped
gently
down
to
the
river
from
whose
farther
bank
a
precipice
sprang
upward
for
perhaps
a
thousand
feet
merging
into
towering
hills
whose
rugged
grandeur
was
reminiscent
of
the
topography
of
the
moon
at
their
backs
the
wall
of
the
gorge
was
steep
but
not
precipitous
and
was
covered
with
shrubs
and
trees
some
of
which
leaned
out
over
the
little
canyon
completely
screening
it
and
among
whose
branches
birds
could
now
and
then
be
seen
flitting
about
in
that
direction
no
mountains
were
visible
indicating
that
upon
their
side
of
the
river
there
was
an
upland
plateau
or
bench
to
their
right
the
river
the
gorge
and
the
strip
of
meadow
extended
for
a
mile
or
more
then
curved
away
and
were
lost
to
sight
to
their
left
almost
too
close
for
comfort
was
the
stupendous
cataract
towering
above
them
to
a
height
nadia
studied
it
with
awe
which
changed
to
puzzled
wonder
what
the
matter
with
it
steve
it
looks
like
a
picture
in
slow
motion
like
the
kind
they
take
of
your
dives
or
am
i
seeing
things
no
it
really
slow
compared
to
what
we
used
to
remember
that
gravity
stuff
oh
that
right
but
it
certainly
does
look
funny
it
gives
me
the
creeps
you
get
used
to
it
pretty
quick
just
as
you
get
used
to
all
the
rest
of
the
things
having
only
half
their
earthly
weight
and
falling
only
half
as
fast
as
they
ought
to
when
you
drop
them
well
i
do
see
anything
that
looks
dangerous
yet
let
go
up
toward
the
falls
a
few
meters
and
prospect
that
outcrop
with
a
few
brisk
strokes
of
an
improvised
shovel
he
cleared
the
outcrop
of
detritus
and
broke
off
several
samples
of
the
black
substance
with
which
they
went
back
to
the
forlorn
hope
it
real
coal
stevens
announced
after
a
series
of
tests
i
seen
better
but
on
the
other
hand
there
lots
worse
it
make
good
gas
and
a
kind
of
a
coke
not
so
hot
but
it
do
now
we
better
get
organized
old
partner
for
a
long
campaign
go
ahead
and
organize
i
only
the
cheap
help
in
this
enterprise
cheap
help
you
apt
to
be
the
life
of
the
party
can
you
make
and
shoot
a
bow
and
arrow
i
say
i
can
i
belonged
to
an
archery
club
for
five
years
what
did
i
tell
you
you
a
life
saver
here
the
dope
we
got
to
save
our
own
supplies
as
much
as
possible
until
we
know
exactly
what
we
up
against
and
to
do
that
we
got
to
live
off
the
country
i
fake
up
something
to
knock
over
some
of
those
birds
and
small
game
then
we
can
make
real
and
feathered
arrows
and
i
forge
some
steel
while
you
making
yourself
a
real
bow
better
make
me
about
a
war
bow
too
a
interrupted
nadia
that
a
lot
of
bow
big
boy
think
you
can
bend
it
you
be
surprised
he
grinned
i
not
quite
like
robin
hood
been
known
to
miss
a
wand
at
a
hundred
paces
but
i
not
exactly
a
beginner
oh
of
course
i
should
have
known
by
your
language
that
you
an
archer
otherwise
you
never
have
used
such
an
word
as
i
shoot
a
bow
ordinarily
but
for
game
i
should
have
the
heaviest
one
i
can
hold
accurately
about
a
probably
all
x
and
as
soon
as
i
can
i
make
us
a
couple
of
suits
of
fairly
heavy
steel
armor
so
that
we
have
real
protection
if
we
should
need
it
you
see
we
do
know
what
we
are
apt
to
run
up
against
out
here
then
with
that
much
done
it
be
up
to
you
to
provide
since
have
to
work
tooth
and
nail
at
the
forges
you
have
to
bring
home
the
bacon
do
the
cooking
and
so
on
and
see
what
you
can
find
along
the
line
of
edible
roots
grains
fruits
and
sort
of
reverse
the
indian
idea
you
be
the
hunter
and
i
keep
the
home
fires
burning
can
do
what
it
takes
to
do
that
i
got
nadia
assured
him
her
eyes
sparkling
have
you
your
job
planned
out
as
well
and
as
fittingly
as
you
have
mine
and
then
some
we
got
just
two
methods
of
getting
away
from
here
one
is
to
get
in
touch
with
brandon
so
that
he
come
after
us
the
other
is
to
recharge
our
accumulators
and
try
to
make
it
under
our
own
power
either
course
will
need
power
and
lots
of
it
i
never
thought
of
going
back
in
the
suppose
we
could
about
as
doubtful
as
the
radio
i
think
that
i
could
build
a
pair
of
transmitter
and
receptor
units
such
as
are
necessary
for
fed
by
stationary
but
after
i
got
them
built
they
take
us
less
than
half
way
there
then
have
only
what
power
we
can
carry
and
i
hate
even
to
think
of
what
probably
would
happen
to
us
we
certainly
have
to
drift
for
months
before
we
could
get
close
enough
to
any
of
our
plants
to
radio
for
help
and
we
be
taking
awful
chances
you
see
we
have
to
take
a
very
peculiar
orbit
and
if
we
should
miss
connections
passing
the
inner
planets
what
the
sun
would
do
to
us
at
the
closest
point
and
where
what
left
of
us
would
go
on
the
would
be
just
too
bad
besides
if
we
can
get
hold
of
the
they
come
loaded
for
bear
and
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
about
the
rest
of
the
folks
out
here
oh
breathed
the
girl
would
it
be
wonderful
if
we
could
i
thought
of
course
they
all
be
her
voice
died
away
not
necessarily
there
always
a
chance
that
why
i
trying
the
first
however
either
course
will
take
lots
of
power
so
the
first
thing
i
got
to
do
is
to
build
a
power
plant
going
to
run
a
penstock
up
those
falls
and
put
in
a
turbine
driving
a
alternator
then
while
i
trying
to
build
the
i
be
charging
our
accumulators
so
that
no
time
will
be
lost
in
case
the
radio
fails
if
it
does
fail
and
remember
i
not
counting
on
its
working
of
course
i
tackle
the
transmission
and
receptor
units
before
we
start
out
to
drift
it
you
say
it
easy
steve
but
how
can
you
build
all
those
things
with
nothing
to
work
with
it
going
to
be
a
real
job
i
not
try
to
kid
you
into
thinking
be
either
easy
or
quick
here
the
way
everything
will
go
before
i
can
even
lay
the
first
length
of
the
penstock
i
got
to
have
the
pipe
to
make
which
i
got
to
have
flat
steel
to
get
which
i
have
to
cut
some
of
the
partitions
out
of
this
ship
of
ours
to
do
which
i
have
to
have
a
cutting
torch
to
make
which
i
have
to
forge
nozzles
out
of
block
metal
and
to
run
which
i
have
to
have
gas
to
get
which
have
to
mine
coal
and
build
a
to
do
which
good
heavens
steve
are
you
going
back
to
the
stone
age
i
never
thought
of
half
those
things
why
it
impossible
not
quite
guy
things
could
be
a
lot
worse
that
why
i
brought
along
the
whole
hope
instead
of
just
the
lifeboat
as
it
is
got
several
thousand
tons
of
spare
steel
and
lots
of
copper
we
got
ordinary
tools
and
a
few
light
motors
blowers
and
such
stuff
that
gives
me
a
great
big
start
i
wo
have
to
mine
the
ores
and
smelt
the
metals
as
would
have
been
necessary
otherwise
however
it
be
plenty
bad
i
have
to
start
out
in
a
pretty
crude
fashion
and
for
some
of
the
stuff
i
need
i
have
to
make
not
only
the
machine
that
makes
the
part
i
want
but
also
the
machine
that
makes
the
machine
that
makes
the
machine
that
makes
it
and
so
on
just
how
far
down
the
line
i
have
dared
to
think
you
must
be
a
regular
to
think
you
can
get
away
with
such
a
program
as
that
i
am
nothing
else
but
you
see
while
most
of
my
school
training
was
in
advanced
physics
and
mathematics
i
worked
my
way
through
by
computing
and
designing
and
i
done
a
lot
of
labor
of
various
kinds
besides
i
can
calculate
and
design
almost
anything
and
i
can
make
a
pretty
good
stab
at
translating
a
design
into
fabricated
material
i
would
wonder
if
brandon
would
stop
me
since
nobody
had
even
started
to
build
one
when
i
saw
him
last
but
i
helped
compute
it
know
the
forces
involved
as
well
as
he
did
at
that
time
and
it
so
happens
that
i
know
more
about
the
design
of
coils
and
fields
of
force
than
i
do
about
anything
else
so
i
may
be
able
to
work
it
out
eventually
it
is
going
to
be
not
knowing
how
that
will
hold
me
up
it
be
the
lack
of
something
that
i
ca
build
and
that
where
you
will
go
back
and
back
and
back
as
you
said
about
building
the
penstock
back
and
back
is
right
if
i
can
find
all
the
necessary
raw
materials
that
what
probably
going
to
put
a
lot
of
into
the
machinery
and
stevens
went
to
work
upon
a
weapon
of
offense
fashioning
a
crude
but
powerful
bow
from
a
strip
of
spring
steel
strung
with
heavy
wire
how
about
arrows
shall
i
go
see
if
i
can
hit
a
bird
with
a
rock
for
feathers
and
see
if
i
can
find
something
to
make
arrows
out
of
not
yet
anyway
i
bet
on
the
birds
i
going
to
use
pieces
of
this
light
off
the
accumulator
cells
for
arrows
they
wo
fly
true
of
course
but
with
their
mass
i
can
give
them
enough
projectile
force
to
kill
any
small
animal
they
hit
no
matter
how
they
hit
it
after
many
misses
he
finally
bagged
a
small
animal
something
like
a
rabbit
and
something
like
a
kangaroo
and
a
couple
of
plump
birds
almost
as
large
as
domestic
hens
these
they
dressed
with
considerable
distaste
and
a
noticeable
lack
of
skill
we
get
used
to
it
pretty
quick
diana
also
more
expert
he
said
when
the
task
was
done
we
now
have
raw
material
for
and
clothes
as
well
as
food
the
word
being
heavily
accented
nadia
declared
with
a
grimace
but
how
do
we
know
that
they
good
to
eat
we
have
to
eat
and
see
he
grinned
i
do
imagine
that
any
flesh
is
really
poisonous
and
we
have
to
arrive
at
the
ones
we
like
best
by
a
process
of
trial
and
error
well
here
your
job
i
get
busy
on
mine
do
go
more
than
a
few
hundred
meters
away
and
yell
if
you
get
into
a
jam
there
a
couple
of
questions
i
want
to
ask
you
what
makes
it
so
warm
here
when
the
sun
so
far
away
and
jupiter
is
supposed
to
be
radiating
any
heat
and
how
about
time
it
twelve
hours
by
my
watch
since
sunrise
this
morning
and
it
still
shining
as
for
heat
i
been
wondering
about
that
it
must
be
due
to
internal
heat
because
even
though
jupiter
may
be
warm
or
even
hot
it
certainly
is
radiating
much
since
it
has
a
temperature
of
minus
two
hundred
at
the
visible
surface
which
of
course
is
the
top
of
the
atmosphere
our
heat
here
is
probably
caused
by
radioactivity
that
the
most
modern
dope
i
believe
as
for
time
it
looks
as
though
our
days
were
something
better
than
thirty
hours
long
instead
of
of
course
keep
the
chronometer
going
on
time
since
we
probably
need
it
in
working
out
observations
but
we
might
as
well
let
our
watches
run
down
and
work
eat
and
sleep
by
the
sun
not
much
sense
in
trying
to
keep
tellurian
time
here
as
i
see
it
check
all
i
have
supper
ready
for
you
at
sunset
a
few
evenings
later
when
stevens
came
in
after
his
long
day
work
he
was
surprised
to
see
nadia
dressed
in
a
suit
of
brown
coveralls
and
moccasins
how
do
i
look
she
asked
pirouetting
gayly
neat
but
not
gaudy
he
approved
that
good
smooth
soft
and
tough
where
you
make
the
raise
i
did
know
we
had
anything
like
that
on
board
what
did
you
do
for
thread
you
look
like
a
million
dollars
you
sure
did
a
good
job
of
fitting
i
had
to
have
something
what
with
all
the
thorns
and
brush
there
was
almost
more
of
me
exposed
than
covered
and
i
was
getting
scratched
up
something
fierce
so
i
ripped
up
one
of
the
and
found
out
that
there
enough
cloth
fur
and
leather
in
one
of
them
to
make
six
ordinary
suits
and
thread
by
the
kilometer
i
was
awfully
glad
to
see
all
that
thread
i
had
an
idea
that
i
have
to
unravel
my
stockings
or
something
but
i
did
your
clothes
are
getting
pretty
tacky
too
and
you
getting
all
burned
with
those
hot
coals
and
things
i
going
to
build
you
a
suit
out
of
leather
for
your
blacksmithing
activities
fine
business
ace
then
we
can
save
what
left
of
our
civilized
clothes
for
the
return
trip
what
do
we
eat
the
eternal
question
of
the
hungry
laboring
man
i
got
a
roasted
bongo
a
fried
filamaloo
bird
and
a
boiled
warple
for
the
meat
dishes
for
vegetables
mashed
hikoderms
and
pimola
greens
neocorn
bread
translate
that
please
into
terms
of
food
translate
it
yourself
after
you
eat
it
i
changed
the
system
on
you
today
i
named
all
the
things
so
it
be
easier
to
keep
track
of
those
we
like
and
the
ones
we
do
with
appetites
by
long
hours
of
hard
labor
they
ate
heartily
then
in
the
deepening
twilight
they
sat
and
talked
in
comradely
fashion
while
stevens
smoked
one
precious
cigarette
it
was
not
long
until
nadia
had
her
work
well
in
hand
game
was
plentiful
and
the
fertile
valley
and
the
neighboring
upland
yielded
peculiar
but
savory
vegetable
foods
in
variety
and
abundance
so
that
soon
she
was
able
to
spend
some
time
with
stevens
helping
him
as
much
as
she
could
thus
she
came
to
realize
the
true
magnitude
of
the
task
he
faced
and
the
real
seriousness
of
their
position
as
stevens
had
admitted
before
the
work
was
started
he
had
known
that
he
had
set
himself
a
gigantic
task
but
he
had
not
permitted
himself
to
follow
step
by
step
the
difficulties
that
he
knew
awaited
him
now
as
the
days
stretched
into
weeks
and
on
into
months
he
was
forced
to
take
every
laborious
step
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
just
how
nearly
impossible
that
herculean
labor
was
to
prove
just
how
dependent
any
given
earthly
activity
is
upon
a
vast
number
of
others
here
he
was
alone
everything
he
needed
must
be
manufactured
by
his
own
hands
from
its
original
sources
he
had
known
that
progress
would
be
slow
and
he
had
been
prepared
for
that
but
he
had
not
pictured
even
to
himself
half
of
the
maddening
setbacks
which
occurred
time
after
time
because
of
the
crudity
of
the
tools
and
equipment
he
was
forced
to
use
all
too
often
a
machine
or
part
the
product
of
many
hours
of
grueling
labor
would
fail
because
of
the
lack
of
some
insignificant
thing
some
item
so
common
as
to
be
taken
for
granted
in
all
terrestrial
shops
but
impossible
of
fabrication
with
the
means
at
his
disposal
at
such
times
he
would
set
his
grim
jaw
a
trifle
harder
go
back
one
step
farther
toward
the
stone
age
and
begin
all
over
again
to
find
the
necessary
raw
material
or
a
possible
substitute
and
then
to
build
the
apparatus
and
machinery
necessary
to
produce
the
part
he
required
thus
the
task
progressed
and
nadia
watched
her
become
leaner
and
harder
and
more
desperate
day
by
day
unable
in
any
way
to
lighten
his
fearful
load
in
the
brief
period
of
rest
following
a
noonday
meal
stevens
lay
prone
upon
the
warm
fragrant
grass
beside
the
forlorn
hope
but
it
was
evident
to
nadia
that
he
was
not
resting
his
burned
and
blistered
hands
were
locked
savagely
behind
his
head
his
eyes
were
closed
too
tightly
and
every
tense
line
of
his
body
was
eloquent
of
a
strain
even
more
mental
than
physical
she
studied
him
for
minutes
her
fine
eyes
clouded
then
sat
down
beside
him
and
put
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
i
want
to
talk
to
you
a
minute
steve
she
said
gently
all
x
little
fellow
but
it
might
be
just
as
well
if
you
did
touch
me
you
see
i
getting
so
rabid
that
i
ca
trust
myself
that
exactly
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
a
fiery
blush
burned
through
her
deep
tan
but
her
low
clear
voice
did
not
falter
and
her
eyes
held
his
unflinchingly
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
as
i
said
before
you
are
killing
yourself
but
it
is
the
work
frightfully
hard
and
disheartening
as
it
is
that
is
doing
it
your
anxiety
for
me
and
the
uncertainty
of
everything
you
have
been
able
to
rest
because
you
have
been
raging
and
fuming
so
at
unavoidable
conditions
you
have
been
fighting
and
it
all
useless
steve
between
you
and
me
everything
would
check
out
on
zero
if
just
come
out
into
the
open
the
man
gaunt
frame
seemed
to
stiffen
even
more
rigidly
you
said
altogether
too
much
or
else
only
half
enough
nadia
you
know
of
course
that
i
loved
you
ever
since
i
got
really
to
know
you
and
that
did
take
long
you
know
that
i
love
you
and
you
know
how
i
love
you
with
the
real
love
that
a
man
can
feel
for
only
one
woman
and
only
once
in
his
life
and
you
know
exactly
what
we
up
against
now
that
tear
it
wide
open
he
finished
bitterly
no
it
does
at
all
she
replied
steadily
of
course
i
know
that
you
love
me
and
i
glory
in
it
and
since
you
do
seem
to
realize
that
i
love
you
in
exactly
the
same
way
i
tell
you
so
love
you
good
heavens
steve
i
never
dreamed
that
such
a
man
as
you
are
really
existed
but
you
fighting
too
many
things
at
once
and
killing
you
and
they
mostly
imaginary
at
that
ca
you
see
that
there
no
need
of
uncertainty
between
you
and
me
that
there
is
no
need
of
you
driving
yourself
to
desperation
on
my
account
whatever
must
be
is
all
x
with
me
steve
if
you
can
build
everything
you
need
all
well
and
good
we
be
engaged
until
then
and
our
love
will
be
open
and
sweet
if
worst
comes
to
worst
so
that
we
can
neither
communicate
with
brandon
and
westfall
nor
leave
here
under
our
own
power
even
that
is
nothing
to
kill
ourselves
about
and
yes
i
do
know
exactly
what
we
are
facing
i
have
been
prepared
for
it
ever
since
i
first
saw
what
a
perfectly
impossible
thing
you
are
attempting
you
are
trying
to
go
from
almost
the
age
of
bronze
clear
up
to
in
a
month
or
two
not
one
man
in
a
million
could
have
done
as
much
in
his
lifetime
as
you
have
done
in
the
last
few
weeks
and
i
do
not
see
how
even
you
with
what
little
you
have
to
work
with
can
possibly
build
such
things
as
transmitters
and
stations
but
what
of
it
for
the
day
that
it
becomes
clear
that
we
are
to
remain
here
indefinitely
that
day
we
will
marry
each
other
here
before
god
look
around
at
this
beautiful
country
could
there
be
a
finer
world
upon
which
to
found
a
new
race
when
we
decided
to
cut
loose
from
the
i
told
you
that
i
was
with
you
all
the
way
and
now
repeat
it
with
a
lot
more
meaning
no
matter
what
it
like
steve
no
matter
where
it
leads
to
i
with
you
the
end
of
the
here
or
upon
earth
or
anywhere
in
the
universe
i
am
yours
for
life
and
for
eternity
while
she
was
speaking
the
grim
strained
lines
upon
stevens
face
had
disappeared
and
as
she
fell
silent
he
straightened
up
and
gently
tenderly
reverently
he
took
her
lithe
body
into
his
arms
you
right
sweetheart
everything
check
out
on
zero
to
nineteen
decimals
he
was
a
man
transfigured
i
been
fighting
windmills
and
i
been
scared
sick
but
how
was
i
to
think
that
a
like
you
could
ever
love
a
mutt
like
me
you
certainly
are
the
gamest
little
partner
a
man
ever
had
you
the
world
straightest
shooter
ace
you
a
square
brick
if
there
ever
was
one
your
sheer
nerve
in
being
willing
to
go
the
whole
route
makes
me
love
you
more
than
ever
if
such
a
thing
can
be
possible
and
it
certainly
puts
a
new
face
on
the
whole
universe
for
me
however
i
do
believe
it
will
come
to
that
after
what
you
just
said
i
sure
will
lick
that
job
regardless
of
how
many
different
factories
it
takes
to
make
one
armature
i
show
that
mess
of
what
kind
of
trees
make
shingles
the
girl
still
in
his
arms
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
released
her
slowly
reluctantly
unwilling
ever
to
let
her
go
then
he
shook
himself
as
though
an
overwhelming
burden
had
been
lifted
from
his
shoulders
and
laughed
happily
see
this
cigarette
he
went
on
lightly
the
last
of
the
mohicans
i
going
to
smoke
it
in
honor
of
our
engagement
he
drew
the
fragrant
smoke
deep
into
his
lungs
and
frowned
at
her
in
mock
seriousness
this
would
be
a
nice
world
to
live
on
of
course
but
the
jobs
here
are
too
darn
steady
it
also
seems
to
be
somewhat
lacking
in
modern
conveniences
such
as
and
machine
tools
then
too
it
is
just
a
trifle
too
far
from
the
royal
and
ancient
for
you
really
to
enjoy
living
here
permanently
and
besides
i
ca
get
my
favorite
brand
of
cigarettes
around
here
therefore
after
due
deliberation
i
believe
we
take
the
place
we
go
back
to
tellus
kiss
me
just
once
more
ace
and
i
make
that
job
think
a
cyclone
has
struck
it
right
on
the
center
of
impact
like
samuel
weller
or
whoever
it
was
i
clear
full
of
wim
and
witality
the
specified
kiss
and
several
others
duly
delivered
he
strode
blithely
away
and
the
little
canyon
resounded
with
the
blows
of
his
heavy
sledge
as
he
attacked
with
renewed
spirit
the
great
forging
from
his
which
was
to
become
the
shaft
of
his
nadia
watched
him
for
a
moment
her
very
heart
in
her
eyes
then
picked
up
her
spanner
and
went
after
more
steel
breathing
a
long
and
tremulous
but
supremely
happy
sigh
chapter
iv
ganymedean
life
slow
hard
and
disheartening
as
the
work
had
been
at
first
stevens
had
never
slackened
his
pace
and
after
a
time
as
his
facilities
increased
the
exasperating
setbacks
decreased
in
number
and
severity
and
his
progress
became
faster
and
faster
large
as
the
forlorn
hope
was
space
was
soon
at
a
premium
for
their
craft
became
a
veritable
factory
housing
a
variety
of
machinery
and
equipment
unknown
in
any
single
earthly
industrial
plant
nothing
was
ornamental
everything
was
stripped
to
its
barest
fundamental
necessities
but
every
working
part
functioned
with
a
smooth
precision
to
delight
the
senses
of
any
good
mechanic
in
a
cavern
under
the
falls
was
the
great
turbine
to
be
by
the
crude
but
tight
penstock
which
clung
to
the
wall
of
the
gorge
angling
up
to
the
brink
of
that
stupendous
cataract
bedded
down
upon
solid
rock
there
was
a
alternator
capable
of
absorbing
the
entire
output
of
the
mighty
turbine
this
was
connected
to
a
set
of
converters
from
which
the
energy
would
flow
along
three
great
copper
cables
the
receptors
of
the
lifeboats
being
altogether
too
small
to
carry
the
load
to
the
now
completely
exhausted
accumulators
of
the
forlorn
hope
all
apparatus
was
shielded
and
grounded
so
that
no
stray
impulses
could
reveal
to
the
possible
detectors
of
the
jovians
the
presence
of
this
foreign
power
plant
housings
frames
spiders
all
stationary
parts
were
rough
crude
and
massive
but
bearings
shafts
armatures
all
moving
parts
were
of
a
polished
and
finished
accuracy
and
balance
that
promised
months
and
years
of
operation
everything
ready
for
the
test
stevens
took
off
his
frayed
and
torn
leather
coveralls
and
moccasins
and
climbed
nimbly
up
the
penstock
he
never
walked
down
opening
the
he
poised
sharply
upon
its
extremity
and
took
off
in
a
perfect
floating
unconcernedly
down
toward
that
boiling
maelstrom
two
hundred
feel
below
he
struck
the
water
with
a
sharp
smooth
slup
and
raced
ashore
seizing
his
suit
as
he
ran
toward
the
it
was
running
smoothly
and
knowing
that
everything
was
tight
at
the
receiving
end
he
lingered
about
the
power
plant
until
he
was
assured
that
nothing
would
go
wrong
and
that
his
home
manufactured
lubricating
oil
and
grease
would
keep
those
massive
bearings
cool
hunger
assailed
him
and
glancing
at
the
sun
he
noted
that
it
was
well
past
wow
he
exclaimed
aloud
the
boss
just
loves
to
wait
meals
burn
me
up
for
this
he
ran
lightly
toward
home
eager
to
tell
his
sweetheart
that
the
long
awaited
moment
had
arrived
that
power
was
now
flowing
into
their
accumulators
hi
diana
of
the
silver
bow
he
called
how
come
you
no
blow
the
dinner
bell
power
on
come
give
it
a
look
there
was
no
answer
to
his
hail
and
stevens
paused
in
shocked
amazement
he
knew
that
never
of
her
own
volition
would
she
be
out
so
late
nadia
was
gone
a
rapid
tour
of
inspection
quickly
confirmed
that
which
he
already
knew
only
too
well
forgotten
was
his
hunger
forgotten
the
power
plant
forgotten
everything
except
the
fact
that
his
nadia
the
buoyant
spirit
in
whom
centered
his
universe
was
lost
or
he
could
not
complete
the
thought
even
to
himself
swiftly
he
came
to
a
decision
and
threw
off
his
suit
revealing
the
body
of
a
hercules
a
body
ready
for
any
demand
he
could
put
upon
it
always
in
hard
training
months
of
grinding
physical
labor
and
of
heavy
eating
had
built
him
up
to
a
point
at
which
he
would
scarcely
have
recognized
himself
could
he
have
glanced
into
a
mirror
mighty
but
pliable
muscles
writhed
and
swelled
under
his
clear
skin
as
he
darted
here
and
there
selecting
equipment
for
what
lay
ahead
of
him
he
donned
the
heavily
armored
which
they
had
prepared
months
before
while
they
were
still
suspicious
of
possible
attack
it
was
covered
with
heavy
steel
at
every
point
and
the
lenses
of
the
helmet
already
of
unbreakable
glass
had
been
with
thick
steel
bars
tank
and
valves
supplied
air
at
normal
pressure
so
that
his
powerful
body
could
function
at
full
efficiency
not
handicapped
by
the
lighter
atmosphere
of
ganymede
the
sleeves
terminated
in
rubber
wristlets
which
left
his
hands
free
yet
sheltered
from
attack
wristlets
tight
enough
to
maintain
the
difference
in
pressure
yet
not
tight
enough
to
cut
off
the
circulation
he
took
up
his
mighty
and
the
full
quiver
of
heavy
arrows
and
pointed
with
savagely
barbed
tearing
heads
of
forged
steel
and
slipped
into
their
sheaths
the
long
and
heavy
sword
and
the
dirk
which
he
had
made
and
ground
long
since
for
he
knew
not
what
emergency
and
whose
hilts
of
steel
further
protected
his
hands
and
wrists
thus
equipped
he
had
approximately
his
normal
earthly
weight
a
fact
which
would
operate
to
his
advantage
rather
than
otherwise
in
case
of
possible
combat
with
one
last
look
around
the
forlorn
hope
whose
every
fitting
spoke
to
him
of
the
beloved
mistress
who
was
gone
he
filled
a
container
with
water
and
cooked
food
and
opened
the
door
it
wo
be
long
now
now
it
wo
be
long
nadia
caroled
happily
buckling
on
her
pack
straps
and
taking
up
bow
and
arrows
for
her
daily
hunt
i
never
thought
that
he
could
do
it
but
what
it
takes
to
do
things
he
got
lots
of
she
continued
to
improvise
the
song
as
she
left
the
hope
with
its
multitudinous
devices
whose
very
variety
was
a
delight
to
her
showing
as
it
did
the
sheer
ability
of
the
man
whose
brain
and
hands
had
almost
finished
a
task
through
the
canyon
and
up
a
trail
she
climbed
and
soon
came
out
upon
the
sparsely
timbered
bench
that
was
her
hunting
grounds
upon
this
day
however
she
was
full
of
happy
anticipation
and
her
mind
was
everywhere
except
upon
her
work
she
was
thinking
of
stevens
of
their
love
of
the
power
which
he
might
turn
on
that
very
day
and
of
the
possible
rescue
for
which
she
had
hitherto
scarcely
dared
to
hope
thus
it
was
that
she
walked
miles
beyond
her
usual
limits
without
having
loosed
an
arrow
and
she
was
surprised
when
she
glanced
up
at
the
sun
to
see
that
half
the
morning
was
gone
and
that
she
was
almost
to
the
foothills
beyond
which
rose
a
towering
range
of
mountains
snap
out
of
it
girl
she
reprimanded
herself
go
on
like
this
and
your
man
will
go
hungry
and
he
break
you
right
off
at
the
ankles
she
became
again
the
huntress
and
soon
saw
an
animal
browsing
steadily
along
the
base
of
a
hill
it
was
a
creature
much
larger
than
anything
she
had
as
yet
seen
but
it
was
meat
and
her
time
was
short
therefore
she
crept
within
range
and
loosed
an
arrow
with
the
full
power
of
her
hunting
bow
unfamiliar
as
she
was
with
the
anatomy
of
the
peculiar
creature
the
arrow
did
not
kill
the
hexaped
as
she
instantly
named
it
sped
away
and
she
leaped
after
it
she
like
her
companion
had
developed
amazingly
in
musculature
and
few
indeed
were
the
denizens
of
ganymede
who
could
equal
her
speed
upon
that
small
globe
with
its
feeble
gravitational
force
up
the
foothills
it
darted
beyond
the
hills
and
deep
into
a
valley
between
two
towering
peaks
the
chase
continued
before
nadia
third
arrow
brought
the
animal
down
bending
over
the
game
she
became
conscious
of
a
strange
but
wonderful
sweet
perfume
and
glanced
up
to
see
something
which
she
certainly
had
not
noticed
when
the
hexaped
had
fallen
it
was
an
enormous
flower
at
least
a
foot
in
diameter
and
indescribably
beautiful
in
its
crimson
and
golden
splendor
almost
level
with
her
head
the
gorgeous
blossom
waved
upon
its
heavy
stem
based
by
a
massive
cluster
of
enormous
smooth
dark
green
leaves
entranced
by
this
unexpected
and
marvelous
floral
display
nadia
breathed
deeply
of
the
inviting
fragrance
and
collapsed
senseless
upon
the
ground
thereupon
the
weird
plant
moved
over
toward
her
and
the
thick
leaves
began
to
enfold
her
knees
this
carnivorous
thing
however
did
not
like
the
heavy
cloth
of
her
suit
and
turned
to
the
hexaped
it
thrust
several
of
its
leaves
into
the
wounds
upon
the
carcass
and
fed
while
two
other
leaves
rasped
together
sending
out
a
piercing
call
in
answer
to
the
sound
the
underbrush
crackled
and
through
it
and
upon
the
scene
there
crashed
a
nightmare
the
parent
of
the
relatively
tiny
thing
whose
perfume
had
disabled
the
girl
its
huge
and
gorgeous
blossom
was
supported
by
a
long
flexible
writhing
stem
and
its
base
was
composed
of
many
and
highly
specialized
leaves
there
were
saws
and
spears
and
mighty
but
sinuous
tendrils
there
were
slender
shoots
which
seemed
to
possess
some
sense
of
perception
there
was
the
massive
tractor
base
composed
of
extensible
leaves
which
by
their
contraction
and
expansion
propelled
the
mass
along
the
ground
parent
and
child
fell
upon
the
hexaped
and
soon
bones
and
hair
were
all
that
remained
the
slender
shoots
then
wandered
about
the
unconscious
girl
in
her
strange
covering
and
as
a
couple
of
powerful
tendrils
coiled
about
her
and
raised
her
into
the
air
over
the
monstrous
base
of
the
thing
its
rudimentary
brain
could
almost
be
perceived
working
as
it
sluggishly
realized
that
now
full
fed
it
should
carry
this
other
victim
along
to
feed
its
other
offspring
when
they
should
return
to
its
side
barely
outside
the
door
of
the
forlorn
hope
stevens
whirled
about
with
a
bitter
imprecation
he
had
already
lost
time
needlessly
with
a
lookout
plate
he
could
cover
more
ground
in
ten
minutes
than
he
could
cover
afoot
in
a
week
he
flipped
on
the
power
and
shot
the
violet
beam
out
over
the
plateau
to
the
district
where
he
knew
nadia
was
wont
to
hunt
not
finding
her
there
he
swung
the
beam
in
an
ever
widening
circle
around
that
district
finally
he
saw
a
few
freshly
broken
twigs
and
scanned
the
scene
with
care
he
soon
found
the
trail
of
fresh
blood
which
marked
the
path
of
the
flight
of
the
hexaped
and
with
the
peculiar
maneuverability
of
the
device
he
was
using
it
was
not
long
until
he
was
studying
the
scene
where
the
encounter
had
taken
place
he
gasped
when
he
saw
the
bones
and
perceived
three
of
nadia
arrows
but
soon
saw
that
the
skeleton
was
not
human
and
was
reassured
casting
about
in
every
direction
he
found
nadia
bow
and
saw
a
peculiar
freshly
trampled
path
leading
from
the
kill
past
the
bow
down
the
valley
he
could
not
understand
the
spoor
but
it
was
easily
followed
and
he
shot
the
beam
along
it
at
headlong
speed
until
he
came
up
with
the
monstrous
creature
that
was
making
it
until
he
saw
what
burden
that
organism
was
carrying
he
leaped
to
the
controls
of
the
lifeboat
then
dropped
his
hand
while
the
stream
of
power
now
flowing
was
ample
to
operate
the
lookout
plates
yet
it
would
be
many
hours
before
the
accumulator
cells
would
be
in
condition
to
drive
the
craft
even
that
short
distance
it
take
over
an
hour
to
get
there
here
hoping
i
can
check
in
all
x
he
muttered
savagely
as
he
took
careful
note
of
the
location
and
direction
of
the
creature
trail
and
set
off
at
a
fast
the
carnivorous
flower
first
warning
that
all
was
not
well
was
received
when
stevens
feet
landed
squarely
upon
its
base
and
one
sweeping
cut
of
his
sword
lopped
off
the
malignant
blossom
and
severed
the
two
tendrils
that
still
held
the
unconscious
nadia
with
a
quick
heave
of
his
shoulder
he
tossed
her
lightly
backward
into
the
track
the
creature
had
made
and
tried
to
leap
away
but
the
instant
he
had
consumed
in
rescuing
the
girl
had
been
enough
for
the
thing
to
seize
him
and
he
found
himself
battling
for
his
very
life
no
infant
this
but
a
monster
well
equipped
with
mighty
weapons
of
offense
and
defense
well
it
was
for
the
struggling
man
that
he
was
encased
in
armor
steel
as
those
leaves
drove
against
him
with
crushing
force
well
it
was
for
him
that
he
had
his
own
independent
air
supply
so
that
that
deadly
perfume
eddied
ineffective
about
his
helmeted
head
hard
and
fiercely
driven
as
those
terrible
thorns
were
they
could
do
no
more
than
dent
his
heavy
armor
his
powerful
left
arm
driving
the
dirk
in
short
resistless
arcs
managed
to
keep
the
snaky
tendrils
from
coiling
about
his
right
arm
which
was
wielding
the
heavy
trenchant
sword
every
time
that
mighty
blade
descended
it
cleaved
its
length
through
snapping
spikes
and
impotently
grinding
leaves
but
more
than
once
a
flailing
tendril
coiled
about
his
neck
armor
and
held
his
helmet
immovable
as
though
in
a
vise
while
those
frightful
grinding
saws
sought
to
rip
their
way
through
the
glass
to
the
living
creature
inside
the
peculiar
metal
housing
dirk
and
saber
and
magnificent
physique
finally
triumphed
but
it
was
not
until
each
leaf
was
literally
severed
from
every
other
leaf
that
the
outlandish
organism
gave
up
the
ghost
nadia
had
been
tossed
out
into
pure
air
beyond
the
zone
of
the
stupefying
perfume
and
she
recovered
her
senses
in
time
to
see
the
finish
of
the
battle
stevens
assured
that
his
foe
was
du
turned
toward
the
spot
where
he
had
thrown
nadia
body
he
saw
that
she
was
unharmed
and
sprang
toward
her
in
relief
he
was
surprised
beyond
measure
however
to
see
her
run
away
at
a
pace
he
could
not
hope
to
equal
encumbered
as
he
was
motioning
frantically
at
him
the
while
to
keep
away
from
her
he
stopped
astounded
and
started
to
unscrew
his
helmet
whereupon
she
dashed
back
toward
him
signaling
him
emphatically
to
leave
his
armor
exactly
as
it
was
he
stood
still
and
stared
at
her
an
exasperated
question
large
upon
his
face
until
she
made
clear
to
him
that
he
was
to
follow
her
at
a
safe
distance
then
she
set
off
at
a
rapid
walk
she
led
him
back
to
where
the
hexaped
had
fallen
where
she
retrieved
her
bow
and
arrows
then
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
upon
all
sides
she
went
on
to
a
small
stream
of
water
she
made
the
dumbfounded
man
go
out
into
the
middle
of
the
creek
and
lie
down
and
roll
over
in
the
water
approaching
him
sniffing
cautiously
between
immersions
she
made
him
continue
the
bathing
until
she
could
detect
not
even
the
slightest
trace
of
the
sweet
but
noxious
fragrance
of
that
peculiarly
terrible
form
of
ganymedean
life
only
then
did
she
allow
him
to
remove
his
helmet
so
that
she
could
give
him
the
greeting
for
which
they
both
had
longed
and
tell
him
what
it
was
all
about
so
that
it
ace
he
exclaimed
still
holding
her
tightly
in
his
iron
embrace
great
balls
of
fire
i
thought
maybe
you
were
still
a
little
cuckoo
anaesthetic
perfume
huh
hot
stuff
i
say
no
wonder
you
bit
i
would
too
it
lucky
for
us
i
was
we
both
be
fee
stop
it
she
interrupted
him
sharply
forget
it
do
ever
even
think
of
it
all
x
ace
it
out
like
the
well
known
light
what
to
do
getting
darker
than
a
hat
and
we
a
long
way
from
home
do
know
whether
i
could
find
my
way
back
in
the
dark
or
not
and
just
between
you
and
me
i
not
particularly
keen
on
night
travel
in
these
parts
after
what
just
happened
are
you
anything
else
but
she
assured
him
fervently
i
lots
rather
stay
hungry
until
tomorrow
no
need
of
that
i
brought
along
enough
supper
for
both
of
us
hungry
as
a
wolf
too
now
that
i
have
time
to
think
of
it
we
eat
and
den
up
somewhere
or
climb
a
tree
those
wampuses
probably
climb
trees
there
a
nice
little
cave
back
there
about
a
hundred
meters
pretend
it
the
ritz
and
they
soon
had
a
merry
fire
blazing
in
front
of
the
retreat
there
they
ate
of
the
provisions
stevens
had
brought
then
while
the
man
rolled
up
boulders
before
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
cave
nadia
gathered
leaves
and
made
a
soft
bed
upon
its
warm
dry
floor
good
night
lover
and
the
girl
untroubled
and
secure
now
that
stevens
was
at
her
side
was
almost
instantly
asleep
but
the
man
was
not
sleepy
he
thought
of
the
power
plant
even
now
sending
its
terrific
stream
of
energy
into
his
accumulators
he
thought
of
the
ultra
radio
where
could
he
get
all
the
materials
needed
he
thought
of
his
friends
wondering
whether
or
not
they
would
receive
his
message
he
thought
of
breckenridge
and
the
other
human
beings
who
had
been
aboard
the
wondering
poignantly
as
to
their
fate
he
thought
of
newton
and
of
his
own
people
who
had
certainly
given
them
up
for
dead
long
since
but
above
all
he
thought
of
the
beautiful
companion
lying
there
asleep
at
his
mailed
feet
and
he
gazed
down
at
her
his
heart
in
his
eyes
the
firelight
shone
through
the
chinks
between
the
boulders
casting
a
flickering
ruddy
light
throughout
the
little
cavern
nadia
lay
there
her
head
pillowed
upon
one
strong
brown
little
hand
her
lips
were
red
and
sweetly
curved
her
cheek
was
smooth
and
firm
as
so
much
brown
velvet
she
was
literally
aglow
with
sheer
beauty
and
with
perfect
health
and
the
man
reflected
as
he
studied
her
hungrily
that
this
wild
life
certainly
had
agreed
with
her
she
was
becoming
more
surpassingly
beautiful
with
every
passing
day
you
little
trump
you
wonderful
lovely
square
little
brick
he
breathed
silently
and
bent
over
to
touch
her
cheek
lightly
with
his
lips
slight
as
the
caress
was
it
disturbed
her
and
even
in
her
sleep
her
subconscious
mind
sent
out
an
exploring
hand
to
touch
her
steve
and
thus
be
reassured
he
pressed
her
hand
and
she
settled
back
comfortably
with
a
long
deep
breath
and
he
stretched
his
length
beside
her
and
closed
his
eyes
firmly
resolved
not
to
waste
a
minute
of
this
wonderful
night
in
sleep
when
he
opened
them
an
instant
later
it
was
broad
daylight
the
boulders
had
been
rolled
away
the
fragrance
of
roasting
meat
permeated
the
atmosphere
and
nadia
was
making
a
deafening
clamor
beating
his
steel
breastplate
lustily
with
the
flat
of
his
huge
saber
daylight
in
the
swamp
you
sleeper
she
exclaimed
roll
out
or
roll
up
come
and
get
it
before
i
throw
it
away
i
must
have
been
kind
of
tired
he
said
sheepishly
when
he
saw
that
she
had
shot
a
bird
and
had
cooked
breakfast
for
them
both
while
he
had
been
buried
in
oblivion
peculiar
too
is
it
nadia
asked
pointedly
you
only
did
about
ten
days
work
yesterday
in
ten
minutes
swinging
this
frightful
snickersnee
of
yours
why
you
played
with
it
as
though
it
were
a
and
when
i
wanted
to
wake
you
up
with
it
i
could
hardly
lift
it
thought
you
did
want
that
subject
even
mentioned
he
tried
to
steer
the
talk
away
from
his
prowess
with
the
broadsword
that
was
yesterday
airily
besides
i
do
mind
talking
about
you
it
thinking
about
us
being
you
know
that
i
ca
stand
all
x
ace
i
get
you
right
let
eat
breakfast
over
they
started
down
the
valley
stevens
carrying
his
helmet
under
his
arm
hardly
had
they
started
however
than
nadia
keen
eyes
saw
a
movement
through
the
trees
and
she
stopped
and
pointed
stevens
looked
once
then
hand
in
hand
they
dashed
back
to
their
cave
we
pile
up
some
of
the
boulders
and
you
lie
low
he
instructed
her
as
he
screwed
on
his
helmet
she
snapped
open
his
but
what
about
you
are
you
coming
in
too
she
demanded
ca
they
surround
us
and
starve
us
out
i
safe
in
this
armor
thank
heaven
we
made
it
as
solid
as
we
did
and
i
fight
in
the
open
i
show
what
the
bear
did
to
the
buckwheat
all
right
i
guess
but
i
wish
i
had
my
armor
too
she
mourned
as
he
snapped
shut
his
plate
and
walled
her
into
the
cave
with
the
same
great
rocks
he
had
used
the
night
before
then
nadia
safe
from
attack
he
drew
his
quiver
of
into
position
over
his
shoulder
placed
one
at
the
ready
on
his
and
turned
to
face
the
horde
of
things
rushing
up
the
valley
toward
him
wild
animals
he
had
supposed
them
but
as
he
stood
firm
and
raised
his
weapon
shrill
whistles
sounded
in
the
throng
and
he
gasped
as
he
realized
that
those
frightful
creatures
must
be
intelligent
beings
for
not
only
did
they
signal
to
each
other
but
he
saw
that
they
were
armed
with
bows
and
arrows
spears
and
slings
creatures
they
were
of
a
color
with
huge
tricornigerous
heads
and
with
staring
green
phosphorescent
eyes
two
of
the
six
limbs
were
always
legs
two
always
arms
the
intermediate
two
due
to
a
jointing
of
the
almost
cylindrical
body
could
be
used
at
will
as
either
legs
or
arms
now
out
of
range
as
they
supposed
they
halted
and
gathered
about
one
who
was
apparently
their
leader
some
standing
erect
and
waving
four
hands
while
shaking
their
horns
savagely
in
stevens
direction
others
trotting
around
on
four
legs
busily
gathering
stones
of
suitable
size
for
their
vicious
slings
too
far
away
to
use
their
own
weapons
and
facing
only
one
small
creature
they
considered
their
game
already
in
the
bag
but
they
had
no
comprehension
of
earthly
muscles
nor
any
understanding
of
the
power
and
range
of
a
bow
driving
a
war
arrow
thus
while
they
were
arguing
stevens
took
the
offensive
and
a
cruelly
barbed
steel
tore
completely
through
the
body
of
their
leader
and
mortally
wounded
the
creature
next
beyond
him
though
surprised
they
were
not
to
be
frightened
off
but
with
wild
shrill
screams
rushed
to
the
attack
stevens
had
no
ammunition
to
waste
and
every
time
that
mighty
bow
twanged
a
arrow
transfixed
at
least
one
of
the
red
horde
and
a
body
through
which
had
torn
one
of
those
ghastly
was
of
very
little
use
thereafter
arrows
splintered
harmlessly
against
the
windows
of
his
helmet
and
against
the
steel
guards
protecting
his
hands
he
was
almost
deafened
by
the
din
as
the
stone
missiles
of
the
slingers
rebounded
from
his
reverberating
shell
of
steel
but
he
fired
carefully
steadily
and
powerfully
until
his
last
arrow
had
been
loosed
then
the
wicked
dirk
in
his
left
hand
and
the
long
and
heavy
saber
weaving
a
circular
path
of
brilliance
in
the
sun
he
stepped
forward
a
couple
of
paces
to
meet
the
attackers
for
a
few
moments
nothing
could
stand
before
that
fiercely
driven
blade
severed
heads
limbs
and
fragments
of
torsos
literally
filled
the
air
but
sheer
weight
of
numbers
bore
him
down
as
he
fell
he
saw
the
white
shaft
of
one
of
flash
past
his
helmet
and
bury
itself
to
the
flock
in
the
body
of
one
of
the
horde
above
him
nadia
knew
that
her
arrows
could
not
harm
her
lover
and
through
a
chink
between
two
boulders
she
was
shooting
into
the
thickest
of
the
mob
speeding
her
light
arrows
with
the
full
power
of
her
bow
though
down
the
savages
soon
discovered
that
stevens
was
not
out
in
such
close
quarters
he
could
not
use
his
sword
but
the
blade
of
the
dirk
as
it
was
and
with
two
serrated
cutting
edges
was
itself
no
mean
weapon
and
time
after
time
he
drove
it
deep
taking
life
at
every
thrust
four
more
red
monsters
threw
themselves
upon
the
prostrate
man
but
not
sufficiently
versed
in
armor
to
seek
out
its
joints
their
fierce
short
spear
thrusts
did
no
damage
presently
four
more
corpses
lay
still
and
stevens
with
his
to
them
incredible
earthly
strength
was
once
more
upon
his
feet
in
spite
of
their
utmost
efforts
to
pinion
his
mighty
limbs
and
was
again
swinging
his
devastating
weapon
half
their
force
lying
upon
the
field
wiped
out
by
a
small
but
invincible
and
apparently
invulnerable
being
the
remainder
broke
and
ran
pursued
by
stevens
to
the
point
where
the
red
monsters
had
first
halted
he
recovered
his
arrows
and
returned
to
the
cave
opening
his
as
he
came
all
x
sweetheart
he
asked
rolling
away
the
boulders
did
get
anything
through
to
you
did
they
no
they
did
even
realize
that
i
was
taking
part
in
the
battle
i
guess
did
they
hurt
you
while
they
had
you
down
i
was
scared
to
death
for
a
minute
no
the
old
armor
held
one
of
them
must
have
gnawed
on
my
ankle
some
between
the
greave
and
the
but
he
could
quite
get
through
darn
small
opening
there
too
must
have
bent
my
foot
around
to
get
in
at
all
have
to
tighten
that
joint
up
a
little
i
guess
i
bet
i
got
a
black
spot
and
blue
spot
there
the
size
of
my
hand
maybe
it
only
the
size
of
yours
though
you
wo
die
of
that
probably
heavens
steve
that
cleaver
of
yours
is
a
frightful
thing
in
action
suppose
it
safe
for
us
to
go
home
absolutely
right
now
is
the
best
chance
we
ever
have
and
something
tells
me
that
we
better
make
it
snappy
they
be
back
and
next
time
they
wo
be
so
easy
to
take
all
x
then
hold
me
steve
i
ca
stand
the
sight
of
that
alone
wade
through
it
i
going
to
faint
or
something
sure
as
you
were
he
snapped
you
are
going
to
pass
out
now
that
all
over
it
a
pretty
ghastly
mess
i
know
but
shut
your
eyes
and
i
carry
you
out
of
sight
are
we
out
of
sight
of
that
place
yet
she
demanded
after
a
time
i
have
been
for
quite
a
while
he
confessed
but
you
sitting
pretty
are
you
and
you
are
very
heavy
not
here
on
ganymede
anyway
put
me
down
she
commanded
after
that
crack
i
wo
play
with
you
any
more
at
all
i
pick
up
my
marbles
and
go
home
he
released
her
and
they
hurried
hack
toward
their
waterfall
keeping
wary
eyes
for
danger
in
any
form
animal
or
vegetable
on
the
way
back
across
the
foothills
stevens
shot
another
hexaped
and
upon
the
plateau
above
the
river
nadia
bagged
several
birds
and
small
animals
but
it
was
not
until
they
were
actually
in
their
own
little
canyon
that
their
rapid
pace
slackened
and
their
vigilance
relaxed
after
this
ace
we
hunt
together
and
we
go
back
to
wearing
armor
while
we
hunting
it
scared
me
out
of
a
year
growth
when
you
checked
up
missing
we
sure
do
steve
she
concurred
emphatically
i
not
going
to
get
more
than
a
meter
away
from
you
from
now
on
what
do
you
suppose
those
horrible
things
are
which
both
those
flowers
are
like
anything
tellus
ever
saw
so
we
have
no
basis
of
comparison
they
may
be
a
development
of
a
flycatching
plant
or
they
may
be
a
link
between
the
animal
and
the
vegetable
kingdom
however
we
do
intend
to
study
so
let
forget
those
animals
were
undoubtedly
intelligent
beings
they
probably
are
a
race
of
savages
of
this
satellite
then
the
really
civilized
races
are
probably
not
necessarily
there
may
well
be
different
types
each
struggling
toward
civilization
they
certainly
are
on
venus
and
they
once
were
on
mars
why
have
we
seen
anything
like
that
before
in
all
these
months
things
have
been
so
calm
and
peaceful
that
we
thought
we
had
the
whole
world
to
ourselves
as
far
as
danger
or
men
were
concerned
we
never
saw
them
before
because
we
never
went
where
they
lived
you
were
a
long
ways
from
your
usual
you
know
that
flower
is
probably
a
organism
living
in
the
mountains
and
never
coming
as
low
as
we
are
down
here
as
for
the
savages
whatever
they
are
they
probably
never
come
within
five
kilometers
of
the
falls
many
primitive
peoples
think
that
waterfalls
are
inhabited
by
demons
and
maybe
these
folks
are
afflicted
the
same
way
we
do
know
much
about
our
new
world
yet
do
we
we
sure
do
and
i
not
particularly
keen
on
finding
out
much
more
about
it
until
we
get
organized
for
trouble
either
well
here
we
are
just
like
getting
back
home
to
see
the
is
it
it
home
and
will
be
until
we
get
one
of
our
own
on
earth
and
after
stevens
had
read
his
meters
learning
with
satisfaction
that
the
full
current
was
still
flowing
into
the
accumulators
he
began
to
cut
up
the
meat
now
that
you
got
the
running
at
last
what
next
asked
nadia
piling
the
cuts
in
the
freezer
brandon
comes
next
but
it
got
more
angles
to
it
than
a
cubist
picture
of
a
set
of
prisms
so
many
that
i
do
know
where
to
begin
there
that
job
done
let
sit
down
and
i
talk
at
you
awhile
maybe
between
us
we
can
figure
out
where
to
start
i
got
everything
to
build
it
lined
up
except
for
the
tube
but
that
got
me
stopped
cold
you
see
fields
of
force
are
all
right
in
most
places
but
i
got
to
have
one
tube
and
it
got
to
have
the
hardest
possible
vacuum
that
means
a
super
pump
mercury
is
absolutely
the
only
thing
that
will
do
the
trick
and
the
mercury
is
one
thing
that
is
conspicuous
by
its
absence
in
these
parts
so
are
tungsten
for
filaments
tantalum
for
plates
and
platinum
for
leads
and
i
found
anything
that
i
can
use
as
a
getter
either
a
metal
you
know
to
flash
inside
the
tube
to
clean
up
the
last
traces
of
atmosphere
in
it
i
did
suppose
that
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
radio
tube
could
hold
you
up
after
the
perfectly
unbelievable
things
that
you
have
done
already
but
i
see
now
how
it
could
of
course
the
tubes
in
our
receiver
over
there
are
too
small
yes
they
are
only
receiver
and
communicator
tubes
and
i
need
a
transmitting
tube
a
at
least
i
give
my
left
leg
to
the
knee
joint
for
one
of
those
big
right
now
it
would
save
us
a
lot
of
grief
maybe
you
could
break
up
those
tubes
and
use
the
plates
and
so
on
i
thought
of
that
but
it
wo
work
there
is
half
enough
metal
in
the
lot
and
the
filaments
in
particular
are
so
tiny
that
i
possibly
work
them
over
into
a
big
one
then
too
we
have
got
many
spare
tubes
and
if
i
smash
the
ones
we
using
i
put
our
communicators
out
of
business
for
good
so
that
we
ca
yell
for
help
if
we
have
to
drift
home
and
i
still
do
get
any
mercury
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
there
no
mercury
on
this
whole
planet
not
exactly
but
i
do
mean
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
any
and
that
it
probably
darned
scarce
and
since
all
the
other
metals
i
want
worst
are
also
very
dense
and
of
high
atomic
weight
they
probably
mighty
scarce
here
too
why
because
we
on
a
satellite
and
no
matter
what
hypothesis
you
accept
for
the
origin
of
satellites
you
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
heavy
metals
are
either
absent
or
most
awfully
scarce
and
buried
deep
down
toward
the
center
there
are
lots
of
heavy
metals
in
jupiter
somewhere
but
we
probably
could
find
them
jupiter
atmosphere
is
one
mass
of
fog
and
we
could
see
since
we
have
got
an
transformer
i
could
build
one
in
time
but
it
would
take
quite
a
while
and
we
could
work
on
jupiter
anyway
because
of
its
gravity
and
probably
because
of
its
atmosphere
and
even
if
we
could
work
there
we
do
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
prospecting
for
mercury
stevens
fell
silent
brow
wrinkled
in
thought
you
mean
dear
that
we
nadia
broke
off
the
sentence
unfinished
gosh
no
there
lots
of
things
not
tried
yet
and
we
can
always
set
out
to
drift
it
i
was
thinking
only
of
building
the
tube
and
trying
to
think
say
nadia
what
do
you
know
about
comet
not
a
thing
except
that
i
remember
reading
in
the
newspapers
that
it
was
peculiar
for
something
or
other
but
what
has
cantrell
comet
got
to
do
with
the
high
cost
of
living
or
with
radio
tubes
have
you
gone
cuckoo
all
of
a
sudden
you
be
surprised
stevens
grinned
at
her
puzzled
expression
cantrell
comet
is
one
of
jupiter
comet
family
and
is
peculiar
in
being
the
most
massive
one
known
to
science
it
was
hardly
known
until
after
they
built
those
reflectors
on
the
moon
where
the
seeing
is
always
perfect
but
it
has
been
studied
a
lot
since
then
its
nucleus
is
small
but
extremely
heavy
it
seems
to
have
an
average
density
of
somewhere
around
sixteen
there
platinum
and
everything
else
that
heavy
there
girl
they
ought
to
be
there
in
such
quantity
that
even
such
a
volunteer
chemist
as
i
am
could
find
them
heavens
steve
a
look
of
alarm
flashed
over
nadia
face
then
disappeared
as
rapidly
as
it
had
come
into
being
but
of
course
comets
are
really
dangerous
sure
not
a
comet
tail
which
so
many
people
are
afraid
of
as
being
poison
gas
is
almost
a
perfect
vacuum
even
at
its
thickest
and
have
to
wear
anyway
and
speaking
of
vacuum
whoopee
we
do
need
mercury
any
more
than
a
goldfish
needs
a
when
we
get
tube
done
we
take
him
out
into
space
leaving
his
mouth
open
and
very
shortly
he
be
as
empty
as
a
flapper
skull
then
we
seal
him
up
flash
him
out
come
back
here
and
start
spilling
our
troubles
into
brandon
ear
wonderful
steve
you
do
get
an
idea
occasionally
do
you
but
how
do
we
get
out
there
where
is
this
cantrell
comet
i
do
know
exactly
there
one
rub
another
is
that
i
even
started
the
transmitter
and
receptor
units
but
we
got
some
here
on
board
that
i
can
use
so
it
wo
be
so
bad
and
our
comet
is
in
this
part
of
the
solar
system
somewhere
fairly
close
wish
we
had
an
ephemeris
a
couple
of
solar
charts
and
a
real
telescope
you
ca
do
much
without
an
ephemeris
i
should
think
it
a
good
thing
you
kept
the
chronometers
going
you
know
the
time
day
and
dates
anyway
i
have
to
do
without
some
things
that
all
and
the
man
stared
absently
at
the
steel
wall
i
remember
something
about
its
orbit
since
it
is
one
thing
that
all
vessels
have
to
steer
clear
of
think
i
can
figure
it
close
enough
so
that
we
be
able
to
find
it
in
our
little
telescope
or
even
on
our
plate
since
we
be
out
of
this
atmosphere
and
it
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
for
us
to
get
away
anyway
i
afraid
of
those
folks
on
that
whoever
they
were
and
they
must
live
around
here
somewhere
cantrell
comet
swings
about
fifty
million
kilometers
outside
jupiter
orbit
at
aphelion
close
enough
for
us
to
reach
and
yet
probably
too
far
for
them
to
find
us
easily
by
the
time
we
get
back
here
they
probably
will
have
quit
looking
for
us
if
they
look
at
all
then
too
i
expect
these
savages
to
follow
us
up
what
say
little
ace
do
we
try
it
or
do
we
stay
here
you
know
best
steve
as
i
said
before
i
with
you
from
now
on
in
whatever
you
think
best
to
do
i
know
that
you
think
it
best
to
go
out
there
therefore
so
do
i
well
he
said
finally
i
better
get
busy
then
there
a
lot
to
do
before
we
can
start
the
radio
does
come
next
after
all
the
transmitter
and
receptor
units
come
ahead
of
it
they
wo
mean
wasted
labor
in
any
event
since
we
have
to
have
them
in
case
the
radio
fails
you
better
lay
in
a
lot
of
supplies
while
i
working
on
that
stuff
but
do
go
out
of
sight
and
yell
like
fury
if
you
see
anything
we
both
better
wear
full
armor
every
time
we
go
unless
i
all
out
of
control
we
are
done
with
those
savages
yet
even
though
they
may
be
afraid
of
the
demons
of
the
falls
i
think
they
have
at
least
one
more
try
at
us
while
nadia
brought
in
meat
and
vegetables
and
stored
them
away
stevens
attacked
the
problem
of
constructing
the
pair
of
transmitter
and
receptor
units
which
would
connect
his
great
to
the
accumulators
of
their
craft
wherever
it
might
be
in
space
from
the
generators
of
the
forlorn
hope
he
selected
the
two
most
suitable
for
his
purpose
tuned
them
to
the
exact
frequency
he
required
and
around
them
built
a
complex
system
of
condensers
and
coils
day
after
day
passed
their
larder
was
full
the
receptor
was
finished
and
the
beam
transmitter
was
almost
ready
to
attach
to
the
before
the
calm
was
broken
steve
nadia
shrieked
glancing
idly
into
the
communicator
plate
she
had
been
perfunctorily
surveying
the
surrounding
territory
coming
thousands
of
them
they
all
over
the
bench
up
there
and
just
simply
pouring
down
the
hills
and
up
the
valley
wish
they
waited
a
few
hours
longer
we
have
been
gone
however
we
just
about
ready
for
them
he
commented
grimly
as
he
stared
over
her
shoulder
into
the
communicator
plate
we
make
a
lot
of
those
indians
wish
that
they
had
stayed
at
home
with
their
papooses
have
you
got
all
those
rays
and
things
fixed
up
not
as
many
as
i
like
to
have
you
see
i
do
know
the
composition
of
the
ray
since
it
is
outlawed
to
everybody
except
the
police
of
course
i
could
have
found
out
from
brandon
but
never
paid
any
attention
to
it
i
got
some
nice
though
and
a
oscillatory
that
cook
an
elephant
to
a
cinder
in
about
eight
seconds
we
keep
them
amused
no
fooling
glad
we
had
time
to
cover
our
open
sides
and
it
looks
as
though
that
meteorite
armor
we
put
over
the
projectors
may
be
mighty
useful
too
on
and
on
the
savages
came
massed
in
formations
showing
some
signs
of
rude
discipline
this
time
there
was
neither
shrieking
nor
yelling
the
weird
creatures
advanced
silently
and
methodically
here
and
there
were
massed
groups
of
hundreds
dragging
behind
them
engines
which
stevens
studied
with
interest
hm
m
catapults
he
mused
you
were
right
girl
of
my
dreams
armor
and
bows
and
arrows
would
help
us
much
right
now
they
going
to
throw
rocks
at
us
that
have
both
mass
and
momentum
with
those
things
they
can
cave
in
our
and
might
even
dent
our
roof
when
one
of
those
projectiles
hits
we
want
to
know
where
it
ai
that
all
stevens
cast
off
the
plug
connecting
the
power
plant
leads
to
his
now
almost
fully
charged
accumulators
strapped
himself
and
nadia
into
place
at
the
controls
and
waited
staring
into
the
plate
catapult
after
catapult
was
dragged
to
the
lip
of
the
little
canyon
until
six
of
them
bore
upon
the
target
the
huge
stranded
springs
of
hair
fiber
and
sinew
were
wound
up
to
the
limit
and
enormous
masses
of
rock
were
toilsomely
rolled
upon
the
platforms
each
gunner
seized
his
trip
and
as
the
leader
shrieked
his
signal
the
six
ponderous
masses
of
metalliferous
rock
heaved
into
the
air
as
one
but
they
did
not
strike
their
objective
for
as
the
signal
was
given
stevens
shot
power
into
his
projectors
the
forlorn
hope
leaped
out
of
the
canyon
and
high
into
the
air
over
the
open
meadow
just
as
the
six
great
projectiles
crashed
into
the
ground
upon
the
spot
which
an
instant
before
she
had
occupied
rudimentary
discipline
forgotten
the
horde
rushed
down
into
the
canyon
and
the
valley
in
full
clamor
of
their
barbaric
urgings
horns
and
arms
tossed
fiercely
savage
noises
rent
the
air
and
arrows
splintered
harmlessly
upon
steel
plate
as
the
mystified
and
maddened
warriors
upon
the
plain
below
gave
vent
to
their
outraged
feelings
look
nadia
a
whole
gang
of
them
are
smelling
around
that
power
plug
pretty
soon
somebody
going
to
touch
a
hot
spot
and
when
he
does
we
cut
loose
on
the
rest
of
them
the
huge
insulating
plug
housing
the
ends
of
the
three
great
cables
leading
to
the
converters
of
the
lay
innocently
upon
the
ground
its
three
yawning
holes
invitingly
open
to
savage
arms
the
chief
who
had
been
inspecting
the
walked
along
the
triplex
lead
and
joined
his
followers
at
its
terminus
pointing
with
his
horns
he
jabbered
orders
and
three
red
monsters
one
at
each
cable
bent
to
lift
the
plug
while
the
leader
himself
thrust
an
arm
into
each
of
the
three
contact
holes
there
was
a
flash
of
searing
flame
and
the
reeking
smoke
of
burning
flesh
those
three
arms
had
taken
the
terrific
voltage
of
the
converter
system
and
the
full
power
of
the
alternator
had
been
shorted
directly
to
ground
through
the
comparatively
small
resistance
of
his
body
stevens
had
poised
the
forlorn
hope
edgewise
in
so
that
the
gleaming
heavily
armored
parabolic
reflectors
of
his
projectors
mounted
upon
the
leading
edge
of
the
fortress
covered
the
scene
below
as
the
charred
corpse
of
the
savage
chieftain
dropped
to
the
ground
it
seemed
to
the
creatures
that
the
demons
of
the
falls
had
indeed
been
annoyed
beyond
endurance
by
their
intrusion
for
as
if
in
response
to
the
flash
of
fire
from
the
power
plug
that
structure
so
peculiarly
and
so
stolidly
hanging
in
the
air
came
plunging
down
toward
them
from
it
there
reached
down
twin
fans
of
death
and
destruction
one
flaming
and
almost
invisibly
incandescent
violet
which
tore
at
the
eyes
and
excruciatingly
disintegrated
brain
and
nervous
tissues
the
other
dully
glowing
an
equally
invisible
red
at
the
touch
of
which
body
temperature
soared
to
lethal
heights
and
foliage
burst
cracklingly
into
spontaneous
flame
in
their
massed
hundreds
the
savages
dropped
where
they
stood
life
rived
away
by
the
torturing
burned
away
by
the
blast
of
pure
heat
or
consumed
by
the
conflagrations
that
raged
instantly
wherever
that
fan
encountered
combustible
material
in
the
face
of
power
supernatural
they
lost
all
thought
of
attack
or
of
conquest
and
sought
only
and
madly
to
escape
weapons
were
thrown
away
the
catapults
were
abandoned
and
every
man
for
himself
the
mob
fled
in
wildest
disorder
each
striving
to
put
as
much
distance
as
possible
between
himself
and
that
place
of
dread
mystery
the
waterfall
well
i
guess
that
hold
for
a
while
stevens
dropped
their
craft
back
into
its
original
quarters
in
the
canyon
whether
they
ever
believed
before
that
this
falls
was
inhabited
by
devils
or
not
they
think
so
now
i
bet
that
it
will
be
six
hundred
jovian
years
before
any
of
them
ever
come
within
a
hundred
kilometers
of
it
again
i
glad
of
it
too
because
they
let
our
power
plant
alone
now
well
get
going
we
got
to
make
things
hum
for
a
while
why
all
the
rush
you
just
said
that
we
have
scared
them
away
for
good
the
savages
yes
but
not
those
others
we
just
turned
loose
enough
radiation
to
affect
detectors
all
over
the
system
and
it
up
to
us
to
get
this
beam
projector
set
up
get
away
from
here
and
get
our
power
shut
off
before
they
can
trace
us
snap
it
up
ace
the
transmitter
unit
was
installed
at
the
converters
the
cable
was
torn
out
and
having
broken
the
last
material
link
between
it
and
ganymede
stevens
hurled
the
forlorn
hope

nadia
could
endure

after

wedge
of

after

stevens
anxious
eyes
scanned
his

after

mounted

took
the
place
of
anxiety
as
the

remained

every
inquiring

three

ii
spacehounds
of
ipc
of
the
most
fascinating
mysteries
of
the
heavens
is
the
comet
it
goes
through
space
gets
near
enough
to
the
earth
to
be
seen
and
then
goes
off
and
disappears
in
celestial
distance
often
it
has
a
hyperbolic
orbit
which
would
make
it
impossible
to
come
back
yet
it
may
return
apparently
contradicting
the
geometry
of
conic
sections
this
only
goes
to
prove
once
more
that
it
is
risky
to
say
anything
is
impossible
even
that
our
hero
of
this
story
manages
beautifully
with
the
aid
of
cantrell
comet
to
avoid
complete
annihilation
while
stranded
in
interstellar
what
went
before
and
then
continue
the
second
what
went
before
the
interplanetary
vessel
arcturus
sets
out
for
mars
with
breckenridge
as
chief
pilot
carrying
on
board
besides
its
regular
crew
and
some
passengers
the
famous
stevens
designer
of
space
ships
and
computer
he
checks
computations
made
by
astronomers
stationed
in
floating
observatories
and
after
he
has
located
any
trouble
and
suggests
a
plan
for
minimizing
the
hazards
of
the
trip
from
the
earth
to
mars
he
reports
his
findings
and
suggestions
to
newton
chief
of
the
interplanetary
corporation
stevens
then
takes
nadia
newton
beautiful
young
daughter
on
a
specially
conducted
tour
of
the
arcturus
and
thoroughly
explains
to
her
all
of
the
works
of
the
vessel
nadia
has
herself
had
a
good
science
education
while
they
are
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
ship
nearing
the
end
of
their
tour
stevens
feels
a
barely
perceptible
movement
of
the
vessel
from
its
course
when
he
turns
on
the
visiplate
he
is
horrified
to
find
that
a
mysterious
ray
of
unparalleled
power
has
neatly
sliced
the
arcturus
in
several
places
nadia
and
stevens
are
completely
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
crew
and
passengers
of
the
ship
so
they
get
into
a
lifeboat
which
is
equipped
for
a
limited
amount
of
space
travel
despite
the
strict
and
apparently
effective
vigilance
of
the
enemy
destroyer
stevens
and
nadia
make
their
getaway
in
the
lifeboat
which
they
aptly
call
forlorn
hope
and
finally
make
a
safe
landing
on
ganymede
where
stevens
plans
to
build
a
and
a
radio
transmitter
to
enable
him
to
communicate
with
the
earth
or
with
the
ipv
sirius
which
is
used
by
westfall
and
brandon
two
of
the
world
best
scientists
as
a
floating
laboratory
with
the
very
scant
apparatus
and
material
available
stevens
sets
to
work
on
his
power
plant
just
as
they
have
it
completed
and
ready
to
start
for
cantrell
comet
where
stevens
believes
he
can
obtain
the
necessary
metal
for
his
giant
transmitting
tube
they
experience
a
close
call
with
carnivorous
plants
on
the
satellite
and
later
with
savage
inhabitants
which
precipitates
their
trip
to

of

stevens
turned
to
his
companion
with
a
grin
well
nadia
old
here
where
we
turn
spacehounds
again
hope
you
like
it
better
this
time
because
i
afraid
that
we
have
to
stay
weightless
for
quite
a
while
he
slowly
throttled
down
the
mighty
flow
of
power
and
watched
the
conflicting
emotions
play
over
face
in
her
purely
personal
battle
against
the
sickening
sensations
caused
by
the
decrease
in
their
acceleration
i
sorry
as
the
dickens
sweetheart
he
went
on
tenderly
and
the
grin
disappeared
wish
i
could
take
it
for
you
but
but
there
are
times
when
we
got
to
fight
our
own
battles
and
bury
our
own
dead
she
interrupted
gamely
cut
off
the
rest
of
that
power
i
going
to
be
sick
i
be
a
what
do
you
spacehounds
call
us
poor
dubs
who
ca
stand
weightlessness
is
it
yes
but
you
are
i
know
i
not
and
i
not
going
to
be
one
either
i
all
x
steve
it
not
so
bad
now
really
i
held
myself
together
that
time
anyway
and
i
feel
lots
better
now
have
you
found
cantrell
comet
yet
and
why
so
sure
all
of
a
sudden
that
they
ca
find
us
that
power
beam
still
connects
us
to
ganymede
does
it
maybe
they
can
trace
it
ace
he
cheered
i
tell
the
world
you
no
you
a
spacehound
right
most
at
this
stage
of
the
game
would
be
caring
a
whoop
whether
school
kept
or
not
and
here
you
taking
an
interest
in
all
kinds
of
things
already
you
do
girl
of
my
heart
no
fooling
maybe
and
maybe
you
trying
to
kid
somebody
she
returned
eyeing
him
intently
or
maybe
you
just
do
want
to
answer
those
questions
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago
illustration
the
bottom
of
a
shaft
a
section
of
the
rocky
wall
swung
aside
revealing
the
yawning
black
mouth
of
a
horizontal
tunnel
at
intervals
upon
its
roof
there
winked
into
being
almost
invisible
points
of
light
along
that
line
of
lights
the
felt
their
way
coming
finally
into
a
huge
cavern
no
that
straight
data
right
on
zero
across
the
panel
he
assured
her
and
as
for
your
questions
they
easy
no
i
have
looked
for
the
comet
yet
because
we
have
to
drift
for
a
couple
of
days
before
we
be
anywhere
near
where
i
think
it
is
no
they
ca
trace
us
because
there
is
now
nothing
to
trace
unless
they
can
detect
the
slight
power
we
are
using
in
our
lights
and
so
on
which
possibility
is
vanishingly
small
potentially
our
beam
still
exists
but
since
we
are
drawing
no
power
it
has
no
actual
present
existence
see
she
dissented
i
ca
say
that
i
can
quite
understand
how
a
beam
can
exist
potentially
and
yet
not
be
there
actually
enough
to
trace
why
a
thing
has
to
be
actual
or
not
exist
at
all
you
possibly
have
something
that
is
nothing
it
does
make
sense
but
lay
off
those
integrations
of
yours
please
as
now
armed
with
a
stevens
began
to
draw
a
diagram
upon
a
sheet
of
smooth
slate
you
know
that
your
brand
of
math
is
over
my
head
like
a
circus
tent
so
we
let
it
lie
i
take
your
word
for
it
steve
if
you
satisfied
it
all
x
with
me
i
think
i
can
straighten
you
out
a
little
by
analogy
here
a
rough
sketch
of
a
cylinder
with
shade
and
shadow
you
had
descriptive
geometry
of
course
and
so
know
that
a
shadow
being
simply
a
projection
of
a
material
object
upon
a
plane
is
a
thing
or
rather
a
concept
now
take
the
shade
which
is
of
course
this
entire
figure
here
between
the
cylinder
casting
the
shadow
and
the
plane
of
projection
you
simply
imagine
that
there
is
a
point
source
of
light
at
your
point
of
projection
it
is
really
there
the
shade
then
of
which
i
am
drawing
a
picture
has
only
a
potential
existence
you
know
exactly
where
it
is
you
can
draw
it
you
can
define
it
compute
it
and
work
with
it
but
still
it
does
exist
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
differentiate
it
from
any
other
volume
of
air
and
it
can
not
be
detected
by
any
physical
or
mechanical
means
if
however
you
place
a
light
at
the
point
of
projection
the
shade
becomes
actual
and
can
be
detected
optically
by
a
sufficient
stretch
of
the
imagination
you
might
compare
our
beam
to
that
shade
when
we
turn
our
power
on
the
beam
is
actual
it
is
a
stream
of
tangible
force
and
as
such
can
be
detected
electrically
when
our
switches
here
are
open
however
it
exists
only
potentially
there
is
no
motion
in
the
ether
nothing
whatever
to
indicate
that
a
beam
had
ever
actually
existed
there
with
me
floundering
pretty
badly
but
i
see
it
after
a
fashion
you
physicists
are
peculiar
freaks
where
we
ordinary
mortals
see
actual
solid
heavy
objects
you
see
only
empty
space
with
a
few
electrons
and
things
floating
around
in
it
and
yet
where
we
see
only
empty
space
you
can
see
things
that
may
never
exist
at
all
you
be
the
death
of
me
yet
steve
but
i
wasting
a
lot
of
time
what
do
we
do
now
we
get
busy
on
the
big
tube
you
might
warm
up
the
annealing
oven
and
melt
me
that
pot
of
glass
while
i
get
busy
on
the
filament
supports
plate
brackets
and
so
on
both
fell
to
work
with
a
will
and
hours
passed
rapidly
and
almost
silently
so
intent
was
each
upon
his
own
tasks
all
x
steve
nadia
broke
the
long
silence
the
pyrometer
on
the
red
and
the
oven
hot
and
the
man
left
his
bench
taking
up
a
long
paddle
and
an
even
longer
blowpipe
he
skimmed
the
melt
to
a
dazzlingly
bright
surface
and
deftly
formed
a
bubble
i
just
love
to
talk
at
you
when
you
got
your
mouth
full
of
a
blowpipe
nadia
eyed
him
impishly
and
tucked
her
feet
beneath
her
poised
weightless
as
she
was
i
got
you
foul
now
i
can
say
anything
i
want
to
and
you
ca
talk
back
because
your
bubble
will
lose
its
shape
if
you
do
oh
is
that
a
beauty
i
never
saw
you
blow
anything
that
big
before
and
she
fell
silent
watching
intently
slowly
there
was
being
drawn
from
the
pot
a
huge
tapering
bulb
of
hot
glistening
glass
its
at
the
molten
surface
varying
as
stevens
changed
the
rate
of
draw
or
the
volume
of
air
blown
through
the
pipe
soon
that
section
narrowed
sharply
the
waved
his
hand
and
nadia
severed
the
form
neatly
with
a
glowing
wire
just
above
the
fluid
surface
of
the
glass
remaining
in
the
pot
pendant
from
the
blowpipe
the
bulb
was
placed
over
the
where
stevens
now
begoggled
begloved
and
armed
with
a
welding
torch
proceeded
to
fuse
into
the
still
almost
plastic
glass
sundry
necks
supports
and
other
attachments
of
peculiar
pattern
finally
the
partially
assembled
tube
was
placed
in
the
annealing
oven
where
it
would
remain
at
a
high
and
constant
temperature
until
its
filaments
grids
and
plates
had
been
installed
eventually
in
that
same
oven
it
would
be
allowed
to
cool
slowly
and
uniformly
over
a
period
of
days
thus
were
performed
many
other
tasks
which
are
ordinarily
done
either
by
automatic
machinery
or
by
highly
skilled
specialists
in
labor
for
these
two
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
had
long
since
learned
how
much
specialization
may
be
represented
by
the
most
commonplace
article
whenever
they
needed
a
thing
they
did
not
have
which
happened
every
day
they
had
either
to
make
it
or
else
failing
in
that
to
go
back
and
build
something
that
would
enable
them
to
manufacture
the
required
item
such
setbacks
had
become
so
numerous
as
to
be
expected
as
part
of
the
day
work
they
no
longer
caused
exasperation
or
annoyance
for
two
days
the
two
worked
at
many
lines
and
with
many
materials
before
stevens
called
a
halt
all
x
nadia
it
time
for
us
to
stop
tinkering
and
turn
into
astronomers
we
been
out
for
fifty
hours
and
we
better
begin
looking
around
for
our
heap
of
scrap
metal
and
the
girl
at
the
communicator
plate
and
stevens
at
their
one
small
telescope
they
began
to
search
the
black
heavens
for
cantrell
comet
according
to
my
figures
it
ought
to
be
about
four
hours
right
ascension
and
something
like
plus
twenty
degrees
declination
my
figures
are
accurate
though
since
i
working
purely
from
memory
so
we
better
cover
everything
from
aldebaran
to
the
pleiades
but
the
directions
will
change
as
we
go
along
wo
they
not
unless
we
pass
it
because
we
heading
pretty
nearly
straight
at
it
i
think
i
do
see
anything
interesting
thereabouts
except
stars
will
it
have
much
tail
very
little
it
close
to
aphelion
you
know
and
a
comet
does
have
much
of
a
tail
so
far
away
from
the
sun
hope
it
got
some
of
its
tail
left
though
or
we
may
miss
it
entirely
hours
passed
during
which
the
two
observers
peered
intently
into
their
instruments
then
stevens
left
the
telescope
and
went
over
to
his
slate
looks
bad
ace
we
should
have
spotted
it
before
this
time
to
eat
too
you
better
oh
look
here
quick
nadia
interrupted
here
something
yes
it
a
comet
and
quite
close
it
got
a
little
bit
of
a
dim
tail
stevens
leaped
to
the
communicator
plate
and
blond
head
pressed
close
to
brown
the
two
wayfarers
studied
the
faint
image
of
the
wanderer
of
the
void
that
it
i
just
it
is
nadia
declared
steve
as
a
computer
you
a
blinding
flash
and
a
deafening
report
yeah
missed
it
only
about
half
a
million
kilometers
or
so
he
replied
grinning
and
i
fire
a
whole
flock
of
check
stations
for
being
four
thousand
off
however
i
could
have
done
worse
i
could
easily
have
forgotten
all
the
data
on
it
instead
of
only
half
of
it
he
applied
a
normal
negative
acceleration
and
nadia
heaved
a
profound
sigh
of
relief
as
her
weight
returned
to
her
and
her
body
again
became
manageable
by
the
ordinary
automatic
and
involuntary
muscles
guess
i
am
a
kind
of
a
at
that
steve
this
is
much
better
she
exclaimed
nobody
denies
that
weight
is
more
convenient
at
times
but
you
a
spacehound
just
the
same
you
like
it
after
a
while
he
prophesied
stevens
took
careful
observations
upon
the
celestial
body
altered
his
course
sharply
then
after
a
measured
time
interval
again
made
careful
readings
that
it
all
x
he
announced
after
completing
his
calculations
and
he
reduced
their
negative
acceleration
by
a
third
there
we
be
just
about
traveling
with
it
when
we
get
there
he
said
now
little
of
my
bosom
our
supper
been
on
minus
time
for
hours
what
say
we
shake
it
up
i
check
you
to
nineteen
decimals
and
the
two
were
soon
attacking
the
savory
ganymedean
goulash
which
nadia
had
put
in
the
cooker
many
hours
before
should
we
both
go
to
sleep
steve
or
should
one
of
us
watch
it
sleep
by
all
means
there
no
meteoric
stuff
out
here
and
we
arrive
before
ten
tomorrow
time
and
tired
out
by
the
events
of
the
long
day
man
and
maid
sought
their
beds
and
plunged
into
dreamless
slumber
while
they
slept
the
forlorn
hope
drove
on
through
the
void
at
a
terrific
but
constantly
decreasing
velocity
and
far
off
to
one
side
plunging
along
a
line
making
a
sharp
angle
with
their
own
course
there
loomed
larger
and
larger
the
masses
which
made
up
the
nucleus
of
cantrell
comet
upon
awakening
stevens
first
thought
was
for
the
comet
and
he
observed
it
carefully
before
he
aroused
nadia
who
hurried
into
the
control
room
looming
large
in
the
shortened
range
of
the
plate
their
objective
hurtled
onward
in
its
eternal
course
its
enormous
velocity
betrayed
only
by
the
rapidity
with
which
it
sped
past
the
incredibly
brilliant
background
of
infinitely
distant
stars
apparently
it
was
a
wild
jumble
of
separate
fragments
a
conglomerate
heterogeneous
aggregation
of
rough
and
jagged
masses
varying
in
size
from
grains
of
sand
up
to
enormous
chunks
which
upon
earth
would
have
weighed
millions
of
tons
pervading
the
whole
nucleus
a
slow
indefinite
movement
was
perceptible
a
vague
writhing
and
creeping
of
individual
components
working
and
slipping
past
and
around
each
other
as
they
all
rushed
forward
in
obedience
to
the
immutable
cosmic
law
of
gravitation
oh
is
that
wonderful
nadia
breathed
think
of
actually
going
to
visit
a
comet
it
sort
of
scares
me
steve
it
so
creepy
and
crawly
looking
we
awfully
close
are
we
not
so
very
we
probably
have
lots
of
time
to
eat
breakfast
but
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
maybe
i
better
camp
here
at
the
board
and
you
bring
me
over
something
to
eat
all
x
chief
and
stevens
ate
one
eye
upon
the
screen
watching
closely
the
bulk
of
the
comet
for
many
minutes
he
swung
the
in
a
wide
curve
approaching
the
mountain
of
metal
ever
and
ever
more
nearly
then
turned
to
the
girl
hold
everything
nadia
power
going
off
in
a
minute
he
shut
off
the
beam
then
noting
that
they
were
traveling
a
trifle
faster
than
the
comet
he
applied
a
small
voltage
to
one
dirigible
projector
darting
the
beam
here
and
there
he
so
corrected
their
flight
that
they
were
precisely
stationary
in
relation
to
the
comet
he
then
opened
his
switches
and
the
hurtled
on
apparently
motionless
it
was
now
a
part
of
cantrell
comet
traveling
in
a
stupendous
elongated
ellipse
about
the
master
of
our
solar
system
the
sun
there
ace
who
said
anything
about
i
was
watching
you
and
you
never
turned
a
hair
that
time
why
that
right
i
never
even
thought
about
it
i
was
so
busy
studying
that
thing
out
there
i
suppose
i
got
used
to
it
already
sure
you
one
of
us
now
i
knew
you
would
be
well
let
go
places
and
do
things
you
better
put
on
a
suit
too
so
you
can
stand
in
the
and
handle
the
line
they
donned
the
heavily
insulated
heated
suits
and
stevens
snapped
the
locking
plugs
of
the
drag
line
into
their
sockets
upon
the
helmets
hear
me
he
asked
all
x
all
x
on
the
radio
all
x
all
x
i
tested
your
tanks
and
heaters
they
all
x
but
you
have
to
test
i
know
the
ritual
by
heart
steve
it
been
in
every
show
in
the
country
for
the
last
year
but
i
did
know
you
had
to
go
through
it
every
time
you
went
halves
number
one
all
x
two
all
x
three
all
x
quit
it
he
snapped
you
are
testing
those
valves
that
is
no
joke
guy
these
suits
are
complicated
affairs
and
some
parts
are
apt
to
get
out
of
order
you
see
a
thing
to
give
you
fresh
air
at
normal
pressure
and
to
keep
you
warm
in
absolute
space
ca
be
either
simple
or
they
worked
on
them
for
years
but
pretty
crude
yet
they
tricky
and
if
one
goes
sour
on
you
out
in
space
it
just
too
bad
you
lucky
to
get
back
alive
a
lot
of
men
are
still
out
there
somewhere
because
of
the
sloppy
it
please
i
be
good
and
the
careful
checking
and
testing
of
every
vital
part
of
the
went
on
satisfied
at
last
that
the
armor
was
spaceworthy
stevens
picked
up
the
coils
of
built
of
a
fiber
which
could
retain
its
flexibility
and
strength
in
the
bitter
cold
of
outer
space
and
led
the
girl
into
the
heavens
steve
it
perfectly
stupendous
and
grinding
around
worse
than
the
wreckage
of
the
was
when
i
would
let
you
climb
up
it
why
i
thought
comets
were
and
hardly
massive
at
all
exclaimed
the
girl
this
is
little
compared
to
any
regular
planet
or
satellite
or
even
to
the
asteroids
there
only
a
few
cubic
kilometers
of
matter
there
and
as
i
said
before
it
a
decidedly
unusual
comet
you
know
the
game
i
got
it
and
believe
me
i
yank
you
back
here
a
lot
faster
than
you
can
jump
over
there
if
any
one
of
those
lumps
starts
to
fall
on
you
is
this
drag
line
long
enough
yes
i
got
a
hundred
meters
here
and
it
only
fifty
meters
over
there
to
where
i
going
so
long
and
with
a
light
thrust
of
his
feet
he
dove
head
foremost
across
the
intervening
space
a
heavy
pike
held
out
ahead
of
him
straight
as
a
bullet
he
floated
toward
his
objective
a
jagged
chunk
many
yards
in
diameter
taking
the
shock
of
his
landing
by
sliding
along
the
as
its
head
struck
the
mass
then
bracing
his
feet
against
one
lump
he
pushed
against
its
neighbor
and
under
that
steady
pressure
the
enormous
masses
moved
apart
and
kept
on
moving
grinding
among
their
fellows
over
and
around
them
stevens
sprang
always
watching
his
line
of
retreat
as
well
as
that
of
his
advance
until
his
exploring
pike
struck
a
lump
of
apparently
solid
metal
hooking
the
fragment
toward
him
he
thrust
savagely
with
his
weapon
and
was
reassured
that
object
was
not
only
metal
but
it
was
metal
so
hard
that
his
of
alloy
steel
did
not
make
an
impression
upon
its
surface
turning
on
his
helmet
light
he
swung
his
heavy
hammer
repeatedly
but
could
not
break
off
even
a
small
fragment
found
something
steve
nadia
voice
came
clearly
in
his
ears
i
say
i
have
a
hunk
of
solid
metal
about
the
size
of
an
office
desk
i
ca
break
off
any
of
it
so
i
guess
we
have
to
grab
the
whole
chunk
he
hitched
the
end
of
his
cable
around
the
nugget
made
sure
that
the
loops
would
not
slip
and
then
as
nadia
tightened
the
line
he
shoved
mightily
all
x
nadia
she
coming
pull
in
my
drag
line
as
i
said
over
there
and
i
help
you
land
her
inside
the
the
mass
of
metal
was
urged
into
the
shop
where
stevens
clamped
it
immovably
to
the
steel
floor
before
he
took
off
his
why
it
getting
covered
with
snow
and
the
whole
room
is
getting
positively
nadia
exclaimed
sure
anything
that
comes
in
from
space
is
cold
even
if
it
been
out
only
a
few
minutes
and
that
hunk
of
stuff
has
been
out
for
nobody
knows
how
many
million
years
it
did
get
much
heat
from
the
sun
except
at
perihelion
you
know
so
it
probably
somewhere
around
minus
two
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
now
i
have
to
throw
a
heater
on
it
for
half
an
hour
before
we
can
touch
it
and
since
this
is
more
or
less
new
stuff
to
you
i
caution
you
do
try
to
touch
anything
that
has
just
come
in
that
hammer
or
pike
would
freeze
your
hand
instantly
even
though
they
been
out
only
a
little
while
before
you
touch
anything
blow
on
it
like
this
see
if
your
breath
freezes
solid
on
it
like
that
do
touch
it
it
cold
under
the
of
the
heater
the
mass
of
the
metal
was
brought
to
room
temperature
and
stevens
attacked
it
with
his
machine
tools
bit
by
bit
the
stubborn
material
was
torn
from
the
lump
through
heavy
goggles
he
watched
the
incandescent
mass
in
a
refractory
crucible
in
the
heart
of
the
induction
furnace
what
do
you
think
you
got
what
you
want
i
do
know
it
was
iron
it
would
hold
a
magnet
it
royal
metal
of
some
kind
i
think
base
metals
mostly
melt
at
around
fifteen
hundred
and
that
crucible
is
still
dry
as
a
bone
at
better
than
seventeen
how
are
you
going
to
separate
out
the
tantalum
and
the
others
you
want
from
the
ones
that
you
do
want
i
afraid
that
i
not
going
to
very
well
replied
stevens
with
a
wry
grimace
what
i
do
know
about
metallurgy
would
fill
a
library
and
i
probably
the
world
worst
chemist
however
by
a
series
of
successive
liquations
i
hope
to
separate
out
fractions
that
i
can
use
platinum
melts
somewhere
around
tantalum
about
hundred
and
tungsten
not
until
up
around
or
four
hundred
and
that
by
the
way
means
lots
of
grief
of
course
each
fraction
will
probably
be
an
alloy
of
one
kind
or
another
but
i
think
maybe
i
be
able
to
make
them
do
but
may
that
whole
chunk
be
a
pure
metal
it
conceivable
but
not
probable
there
she
beginning
to
separate
at
just
below
eighteen
hundred
platinum
group
coming
out
now
i
think
platinum
rhodium
iridium
and
that
gang
you
know
while
doing
this
you
might
be
getting
those
five
coils
into
exact
resonance
if
you
want
to
sure
i
want
to
and
nadia
made
her
way
across
to
the
oscillator
and
set
to
work
after
an
hour
or
so
bent
over
her
delicate
task
she
began
to
twitch
uneasily
then
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
what
the
idea
of
staring
at
me
so
she
broke
out
suddenly
how
do
you
expect
me
to
tune
these
things
up
if
you
she
stopped
abruptly
mouth
open
in
amazement
as
she
turned
toward
stevens
he
had
not
been
looking
at
her
but
he
turned
a
surprised
face
from
his
own
task
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
excuse
me
please
steve
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
must
be
getting
jumpy
i
guess
i
wish
that
was
all
but
it
is
face
suddenly
grim
and
hard
stevens
leaped
to
the
communicator
plate
and
shot
the
beam
out
into
space
there
an
answer
but
that
is
it
you
a
instrument
yourself
ace
and
you
detected
something
i
thought
so
there
the
answer
the
guy
that
was
looking
at
you
plainly
there
was
revealed
upon
the
plate
a
small
spherical
very
like
the
one
that
had
attacked
and
destroyed
the
after
nadia
had
taken
one
glance
at
it
stevens
shut
off
the
power
and
leaped
out
into
the
shop
he
closed
all
the
bulkhead
doors
and
openings
then
closed
and
secured
the
massive
insulating
door
of
the
lifeboat
in
which
they
had
made
their
headquarters
then
after
they
had
again
put
on
the
they
had
taken
off
such
a
short
time
before
he
extinguished
all
the
lights
and
hooded
the
communicator
screen
before
he
ventured
again
to
glance
out
into
the
void
if
i
had
a
brain
in
my
head
instead
of
the
pint
of
bean
soup
i
got
up
there
we
have
worn
these
when
they
cut
up
the
and
saved
us
a
lot
of
mental
wear
and
tear
he
remarked
they
were
right
there
in
the
lockers
all
the
time
and
i
knew
it
well
we
got
away
anyway
you
could
be
expected
to
think
of
everything
at
once
we
did
have
much
time
you
know
no
but
i
should
have
thought
of
anything
as
obvious
as
that
anyway
wonder
how
they
found
us
did
they
detect
us
or
did
they
come
out
to
this
comet
after
metal
same
as
we
did
and
find
us
accidentally
however
it
all
works
out
the
same
they
apparently
out
to
get
us
i
afraid
this
is
going
to
be
a
whole
lot
like
a
rabbit
fighting
back
at
a
man
with
a
gun
but
we
sure
try
to
nibble
us
off
a
lunch
while
they
getting
a
square
meal
here
they
come
the
enemy
sphere
launched
its
flaming
plane
of
force
and
the
shuddered
in
every
plate
and
member
as
its
apex
was
severed
cleanly
under
the
impact
instantly
stevens
hurled
his
only
weapons
flaming
and
dully
glowing
the
twin
beams
lashed
out
but
their
utmost
force
was
of
slight
moment
to
the
enormous
power
driving
the
enemy
screens
two
circular
spots
of
cherry
red
in
space
were
the
only
results
of
stevens
attack
and
the
next
fierce
cut
sheared
away
the
two
projectors
and
incidentally
a
full
half
of
the
armor
of
the
leading
edge
then
we
checking
out
now
nadia
asked
quietly
as
the
man
hands
dropped
from
his
useless
controls
i
sorrier
than
i
can
say
lover
but
at
least
i
glad
that
i
can
go
out
with
you
and
her
glorious
eyes
were
shining
with
unshed
tears
maybe
but
snap
out
of
it
girl
our
hearts
are
still
beating
not
dead
yet
and
maybe
we
wo
be
perhaps
they
want
to
capture
us
alive
as
they
did
before
if
so
we
may
be
able
to
hide
out
on
them
somewhere
and
pull
off
another
escape
things
do
look
very
bright
i
know
but
we
not
checking
out
until
our
numbers
are
actually
run
up
he
hooked
a
hand
under
her
belt
as
the
shocks
came
closer
and
stood
tense
and
ready
the
lancing
plane
cut
through
one
end
of
their
control
room
and
stevens
leaped
with
his
companion
toward
the
opening
while
the
air
shrieked
outward
into
space
and
their
suits
bulged
suddenly
with
the
abrupt
increase
in
pressure
differential
while
they
were
in
midflight
the
frightful
blade
of
destruction
cleaved
its
way
through
the
control
board
and
through
the
spot
upon
which
they
had
been
standing
a
moment
before
as
they
passed
the
severed
edge
en
route
into
open
spare
stevens
seized
a
metal
brace
and
clung
there
every
nerve
taut
something
funny
here
nadia
he
said
after
a
little
in
a
low
tone
they
should
have
made
one
more
cut
to
make
us
absolutely
blind
and
helpless
as
it
is
they
clipped
off
all
our
projectors
so
we
move
but
i
think
we
got
the
whole
control
compartment
of
number
two
lifeboat
untouched
if
so
we
can
look
around
anyway
let
go
floating
without
effort
from
fragment
to
fragment
they
made
their
way
toward
the
section
of
their
cruiser
as
yet
undamaged
they
found
an
airlock
in
working
order
and
were
soon
in
the
second
lifeboat
where
stevens
hastily
turned
on
a
communicator
and
peered
out
into
space
there
they
are
there
another
stranger
out
there
too
fighting
with
her
now
that
probably
why
they
did
polish
us
off
clumsy
helmets
touching
the
two
terrestrials
stared
into
the
plate
watching
while
the
insensately
vicious
intelligences
within
the
sphere
brought
its
every
force
to
bear
upon
another
and
larger
sphere
which
was
now
so
close
as
to
be
plainly
visible
like
a
gigantic
drop
of
quicksilver
this
second
globe
appeared
its
smooth
and
surface
one
enormous
perfect
spherical
mirror
watching
tensely
they
saw
flash
out
that
frightful
plane
of
seething
energy
with
the
effects
of
which
they
were
all
too
familiar
and
saw
it
strike
full
upon
the
dazzling
ball
this
is
awful
ace
stevens
groaned
they
have
got
either
and
without
them
they
do
stand
a
chance
no
possible
substance
can
stand
up
under
that
beam
when
they
get
done
and
turn
back
to
us
we
have
to
dive
back
to
where
we
were
but
that
brilliant
mirror
was
not
as
vulnerable
as
stevens
had
supposed
the
plane
of
force
struck
and
clung
but
could
not
penetrate
it
broken
up
into
myriads
of
scintillating
crystals
of
light
intersecting
rays
and
cascading
flares
of
sparkling
energy
the
beam
was
reflected
thrown
back
hurled
away
on
all
sides
into
space
in
coruscating
blinding
torrents
and
neither
was
the
monster
globe
inoffensive
the
straining
watchers
saw
a
port
open
suddenly
emit
a
something
and
close
as
rapidly
as
it
had
opened
that
something
was
a
projectile
its
propelling
rockets
fiercely
aflame
as
smoothly
brilliant
as
its
and
seemingly
as
impervious
to
the
lethal
beams
of
the
common
foe
detected
almost
instantly
as
it
was
it
received
the
full
power
of
the
savage
attack
the
hitherto
irresistible
plane
of
force
beat
upon
it
and
heat
rays
enveloped
it
there
were
hurled
against
it
all
the
forces
known
to
the
scientific
minds
within
that
fiendishly
destructive
sphere
finally
only
a
scant
few
hundreds
of
yards
from
its
goal
the
protective
mirror
was
punctured
and
the
freight
of
high
explosive
let
go
with
a
silent
but
nevertheless
terrific
detonation
but
now
another
torpedo
was
on
its
way
and
another
and
another
boring
on
ruthlessly
toward
the
smaller
sphere
fighting
simultaneously
three
torpedos
and
the
giant
globe
the
enemy
began
dodging
darting
hither
and
thither
with
a
stupendous
acceleration
but
the
tiny
pursuers
could
not
be
shaken
off
at
every
dodge
and
turn
steering
rockets
burst
into
furious
activity
and
the
projectiles
rushed
ever
nearer
knowing
that
she
had
at
last
encountered
a
superior
force
the
sphere
turned
in
mad
flight
but
prodigious
as
was
her
acceleration
the
torpedoes
were
faster
and
all
three
of
them
struck
her
at
once
there
ensued
an
explosion
veritably
in
its
intensity
a
flash
of
incandescent
brilliance
that
seemed
to
fill
all
space
subsiding
into
a
vast
volume
of
tenuous
gas
which
feebly
glowing
flowed
about
and
attached
itself
to
cantrell
comet
and
in
the
space
where
had
been
the
enemy
sphere
there
was
nothing
a
pale
blue
rod
of
tangible
force
reached
out
from
the
great
sphere
touched
the
wreckage
of
the
and
pulled
gently
but
with
enormous
power
tractor
beams
again
exclaimed
stevens
still
at
the
plate
everybody
got
but
us
it
seems
and
we
ca
fight
a
bit
any
more
can
we
not
a
chance
bows
and
arrows
would
do
us
much
good
however
we
may
not
need
since
they
fought
that
other
crew
and
have
blown
us
up
they
are
active
enemies
of
ours
and
may
be
friendly
i
any
idea
who
or
what
they
are
since
even
our
communicator
ray
ca
get
through
that
mirror
but
it
looks
as
though
our
best
bet
is
to
act
peaceable
and
see
if
we
ca
talk
to
them
in
some
way
right
right
they
stepped
out
into
the
airlock
from
which
they
saw
that
the
great
sphere
had
halted
only
a
few
yards
from
them
and
that
an
indistinct
figure
stood
in
an
open
door
waving
to
them
an
unmistakable
invitation
to
enter
the
strange
vessel
shall
we
steve
might
as
well
they
got
us
foul
and
can
take
us
if
they
want
us
anyway
we
need
at
least
a
week
to
fix
us
up
any
kind
of
driving
power
so
we
ca
run
and
we
probably
could
get
away
from
those
folks
if
we
had
all
our
power
they
have
blown
us
up
and
they
could
have
done
it
easily
enough
besides
they
act
friendly
so
we
better
meet
them
half
way
dive
floating
toward
the
open
doorway
they
were
met
by
another
rod
of
force
brought
gently
into
the
airlock
and
supported
upright
beside
the
being
who
had
invited
them
to
visit
him
apparently
an
empty
stood
there
a
suit
of
some
partially
transparent
flexible
material
towering
fully
a
foot
over
the
head
of
the
tall
terrestrial
closer
inspection
however
revealed
that
there
was
something
inside
that
suit
a
shadowy
being
staring
at
them
with
large
black
eyes
the
door
clanged
shut
behind
them
they
heard
the
faint
hiss
of
inrushing
air
and
the
inner
door
opened
but
their
enveloping
suits
remained
stretched
almost
as
tightly
as
ever
they
felt
the
floor
lurch
beneath
their
feet
and
a
little
weight
was
granted
them
as
the
got
under
way
stevens
waved
his
arms
vigorously
at
the
stranger
pointing
backward
toward
where
he
supposed
their
own
craft
to
be
the
latter
waved
an
arm
reassuringly
pressed
a
contact
and
a
section
of
the
wall
suddenly
became
transparent
through
it
stevens
saw
with
satisfaction
that
the
was
not
being
abandoned
in
the
grip
of
powerful
tractor
beams
every
fragment
of
the
wreckage
was
following
close
behind
them
in
their
flight
through
space
stevens
and
nadia
followed
their
guide
along
a
corridor
through
several
doors
and
into
a
large
room
which
at
first
glance
seemed
empty
but
in
which
several
of
the
peculiarly
transparent
people
of
the
craft
were
lying
about
upon
cushions
they
were
undoubtedly
human
but
what
humans
tall
and
reedy
they
were
with
enormous
barrel
chests
topped
by
heads
which
though
really
large
appeared
insignificant
because
of
the
prodigious
chests
and
because
of
the
huge
flapping
ears
their
skins
were
a
strikingly
livid
pale
blue
absolutely
devoid
of
hair
and
their
lidless
eyes
without
a
sign
of
iris
were
chillingly
horrible
in
their
stark
contrast
of
enormous
glaring
black
pupil
and
ghastly
transparent
blue
eyeball
as
the
two
terrestrials
entered
the
room
the
beings
struggled
to
their
feet
and
hurried
laboriously
away
soon
one
of
them
returned
dressed
in
an
insulating
suit
and
carrying
three
sets
of
head
harnesses
connected
by
multiplex
cables
to
a
large
box
which
he
placed
upon
the
floor
he
handed
the
headsets
to
the
first
officer
who
in
turn
placed
two
of
them
at
the
feet
of
the
terrestrials
indicating
to
them
that
they
were
to
follow
his
example
in
placing
them
upon
their
heads
outside
the
helmets
they
did
so
and
even
through
the
almost
perfect
insulation
and
in
spite
of
the
powerful
heaters
of
their
suits
they
felt
a
touch
of
frightful
cold
the
stranger
turned
a
dial
and
the
two
wanderers
from
earth
were
instantly
in
full
mental
communication
with
barkovis
the
commander
of
a
of
titan
the
sixth
satellite
of
saturn
well
i
be
say
what
is
this
anyway
steve
exclaimed
involuntarily
and
nadia
smiled
as
barkovis
answered
with
a
thought
clearer
than
any
spoken
words
it
is
a
i
do
not
know
its
fundamental
mechanism
since
we
did
not
invent
it
and
since
i
have
had
little
time
to
study
it
the
apparatus
practically
as
you
see
it
here
was
discovered
but
a
short
time
ago
in
a
small
which
we
found
some
distance
outside
of
the
orbit
of
jupiter
its
source
of
power
had
been
destroyed
by
the
cold
of
outer
space
but
it
was
of
course
a
small
matter
the
crew
of
the
vessel
were
all
dead
they
were
however
of
human
stock
and
of
a
type
adapted
for
life
upon
a
satellite
i
deduce
from
your
compact
structure
your
enormous
atmospheric
pressure
and
your
to
us
unbelievably
high
body
temperature
that
you
must
be
i
suppose
that
you
are
natives
of
jupiter
not
quite
stevens
had
in
a
measure
recovered
from
his
stunned
surprise
we
are
from
tellus
the
third
planet
and
he
revealed
rapidly
the
events
leading
up
to
their
present
situation
concluding
the
people
in
the
other
sphere
were
we
believe
natives
of
jupiter
or
of
one
of
the
satellites
we
know
nothing
of
them
since
we
could
not
look
through
their
screens
you
rescued
us
from
them
do
you
not
know
them
no
our
visirays
also
were
stopped
by
their
screens
of
force
screens
entirely
foreign
to
our
science
this
is
the
first
time
that
any
vessel
from
our
saturnian
system
has
ever
succeeded
in
reaching
the
neighborhood
of
jupiter
we
came
in
peace
but
they
attacked
us
at
sight
and
we
were
obliged
to
destroy
them
now
we
must
hurry
back
to
titan
for
two
reasons
first
because
we
are
already
at
the
extreme
limit
of
our
power
range
and
jupiter
is
getting
further
and
further
away
from
saturn
second
because
our
mirrors
which
we
had
thought
perfect
reflectors
of
all
frequencies
possible
of
generation
are
not
perfect
enough
of
those
forces
came
through
the
mirrors
to
volatilize
half
our
crew
and
in
a
few
minutes
more
none
of
us
would
have
been
left
alive
why
in
some
places
our
very
atmosphere
became
almost
hot
enough
to
melt
water
if
another
of
those
vessels
should
attack
us
in
all
probability
we
should
all
be
lost
therefore
we
are
leaving
as
rapidly
as
is
possible
you
are
taking
the
pieces
of
our
ship
along
we
do
not
want
to
encumber
you
it
is
no
encumbrance
since
we
have
ample
supplies
of
power
in
fact
we
are
now
employing
the
highest
acceleration
we
titanians
can
endure
for
any
length
of
time
stevens
pondered
long
forgetting
that
his
thoughts
were
plain
as
print
to
the
titanian
commander
thank
heaven
these
strangers
had
sense
enough
to
be
friendly
all
intelligent
races
should
be
friends
for
mutual
advancement
but
it
was
a
mighty
long
stretch
to
saturn
and
this
acceleration
was
so
much
how
long
would
it
take
to
get
there
could
they
get
back
would
they
save
time
by
casting
themselves
adrift
making
the
repairs
most
urgently
needed
and
going
back
to
ganymede
under
their
own
power
but
would
they
have
enough
power
left
in
the
wreck
to
get
even
that
far
and
how
about
the
big
tube
he
was
interrupted
by
an
insistent
thought
from
barkovis
you
will
save
time
stevens
by
coming
with
us
to
titan
there
we
shall
aid
you
in
repairing
your
vessel
and
in
completing
your
transmitting
tube
in
which
we
shall
be
deeply
interested
our
power
plants
shall
supply
you
with
energy
for
your
return
journey
until
you
are
close
enough
to
jupiter
to
recover
your
own
beam
you
are
tired
i
would
suggest
that
you
rest
that
you
sleep
long
and
peacefully
you
seem
to
be
handling
the
without
any
trouble
the
pieces
are
grinding
at
all
we
better
live
there
had
we
yes
that
would
be
best
for
all
of
us
you
could
not
live
a
minute
here
without
your
suits
and
efficiently
insulated
as
those
suits
are
yet
your
incandescent
body
temperature
makes
our
rooms
unbearably
hot
so
hot
that
any
of
us
must
wear
a
while
in
the
same
room
with
you
to
avoid
being
burned
to
death
the
incandescently
hot
terrestrials
were
wafted
into
the
open
airlock
of
their
lifeboat
upon
a
wand
of
force
and
soon
had
prepared
a
long
overdue
supper
over
which
stevens
cast
his
infectious
boyish
grin
at
nadia
sweetheart
you
are
undoubtedly
a
number
and
you
have
often
remarked
that
i
you
up
nevertheless
i
think
that
we
were
both
considerably
surprised
to
discover
that
we
are
both
hot
enough
actually
to
consume
persons
unfortunate
enough
to
be
confined
in
the
same
room
with
us
you
funny
steve
like
a
crutch
she
rebuked
him
but
smiled
back
an
elusive
dimple
playing
in
one
lovely
brown
cheek
looking
right
through
anybody
is
too
ghastly
for
words
but
i
think
they
perfectly
all
x
anyway
in
spite
of
their
being
so
hideous
and
so
chapter
vi
a
frigid
civilization
hi
percival
van
schravendyck
stevens
nadia
strode
purposely
into
stevens
room
and
seized
him
by
the
shoulder
are
you
going
to
sleep
all
the
way
to
saturn
you
answered
me
when
i
pounded
on
the
partition
with
a
hammer
but
i
do
believe
that
you
woke
up
at
all
get
up
you
breakfast
will
be
all
spoiled
directly
huh
stevens
opened
one
sluggish
eye
then
as
the
full
force
of
the
insult
penetrated
his
consciousness
he
came
wide
awake
lay
off
those
names
ace
or
you
find
yourself
walking
back
home
he
threatened
all
x
by
me
she
retorted
i
might
as
well
go
home
if
you
going
to
sleep
the
time
and
she
widened
her
expressive
eyes
at
him
impishly
as
she
danced
blithely
back
into
the
control
room
as
she
went
out
she
slammed
his
door
with
a
resounding
clang
and
stevens
pried
himself
out
of
his
bunk
one
joint
at
a
time
dressed
and
made
himself
presentable
gosh
he
yawned
mightily
as
he
joined
the
girl
at
breakfast
i
know
when
i
had
such
a
gorgeous
sleep
how
do
you
get
by
on
so
little
i
do
i
sleep
a
lot
but
i
do
it
every
night
instead
of
working
for
four
days
and
nights
on
end
and
then
trying
to
make
up
all
those
four
nights
sleep
at
once
i
going
to
break
you
of
that
too
steve
if
it
the
last
thing
i
ever
do
there
might
be
certain
advantages
in
it
at
that
he
conceded
but
sometimes
you
got
to
do
work
when
it
got
to
be
done
instead
of
just
between
sleeps
however
i
try
to
do
better
certainly
it
is
a
wonderful
relief
to
get
out
of
that
mess
is
it
i
say
it
is
but
i
wish
that
those
folks
were
more
like
people
they
nice
i
think
really
but
they
so
so
well
so
ghastly
that
it
simply
gives
me
the
blue
shivers
just
to
look
at
one
of
them
they
pretty
gruesome
no
fooling
he
agreed
but
you
get
used
to
things
like
that
i
just
about
threw
a
fit
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
a
martian
and
the
venerians
are
even
worse
in
some
ways
they
so
clammy
and
but
now
i
got
real
friends
on
both
planets
one
thing
though
gives
me
the
pip
i
read
a
story
a
while
ago
the
latest
thing
of
thornton
named
slush
or
some
such
tr
cleophora
an
interstellar
romance
she
corrected
him
i
thought
it
was
wonderful
i
did
it
fundamentally
unsound
look
at
our
nearest
neighbors
who
probably
came
from
the
same
original
stock
we
did
a
tellurian
can
admire
respect
or
like
a
venerian
yes
but
for
one
of
them
wow
beauty
is
purely
relative
you
know
for
instance
i
think
that
you
are
the
most
perfectly
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
but
no
venerian
would
think
so
far
from
it
any
martian
that
had
seen
many
of
us
would
have
to
go
rest
his
eyes
after
taking
one
good
look
at
you
considering
what
love
means
it
does
stand
to
reason
that
any
tellurian
woman
could
possibly
fall
in
love
with
any
man
not
of
her
own
breed
any
writer
is
wrong
who
indulges
in
interplanetary
love
affairs
and
mad
passions
they
simply
do
exist
they
exist
against
all
human
instincts
interplanetary
in
this
solar
system
yes
but
the
dacrovos
were
just
like
us
only
nicer
that
what
gives
me
the
pip
if
our
own
cousins
of
the
same
solar
system
are
so
repulsive
to
us
how
would
we
be
affected
by
entirely
alien
forms
of
intelligence
may
be
you
right
of
course
but
you
may
be
wrong
too
she
insisted
the
universe
is
big
enough
so
that
people
like
the
dacrovos
may
possibly
exist
in
it
somewhere
may
be
the
big
three
will
discover
a
means
of
interstellar
travel
then
i
get
to
see
them
myself
perhaps
yes
and
we
do
and
you
ever
see
any
such
people
i
bet
that
the
sight
of
them
will
make
your
hair
curl
right
up
into
a
ball
too
but
about
barkovis
remember
how
diplomatic
the
thoughts
were
that
he
sent
us
he
described
our
structure
as
being
but
i
got
the
undertone
of
his
real
thoughts
as
well
did
you
yes
now
that
you
mention
it
i
did
he
really
thought
that
we
were
overpowered
warty
hairy
hideously
opaque
and
generally
repulsive
little
monstrosities
thoroughly
unpleasant
and
distasteful
but
he
was
friendly
just
the
same
heavens
steve
do
you
suppose
that
he
read
our
real
thoughts
too
sure
he
did
but
he
is
intelligent
enough
to
make
allowances
the
same
as
we
are
doing
he
is
any
more
insulted
than
we
are
he
knows
that
such
feelings
are
ingrained
and
can
not
be
changed
breakfast
over
they
experienced
a
new
sensation
for
the
first
time
in
months
they
had
nothing
to
do
used
as
they
were
to
being
surrounded
by
pressing
tasks
they
enjoyed
their
holiday
immensely
for
a
few
hours
sitting
idly
at
the
communicator
plate
they
scanned
the
sparkling
heavens
with
keen
interest
beneath
them
jupiter
was
a
brilliant
crescent
not
far
from
the
sun
in
appearance
which
latter
had
already
grown
perceptibly
smaller
and
less
bright
above
them
and
to
their
right
saturn
shone
refulgently
his
spectacular
rings
plainly
visible
all
about
them
were
the
glories
of
the
firmament
which
never
fail
to
awe
the
most
seasoned
observer
but
idleness
soon
became
irksome
to
those
two
active
spirits
and
stevens
prowled
restlessly
about
their
narrow
quarters
i
going
to
go
to
work
before
i
go
dippy
he
soon
declared
got
lots
of
power
and
we
can
rig
up
a
transmitter
unit
to
send
it
over
here
to
our
receptor
then
i
can
start
welding
the
old
together
without
waiting
until
we
get
to
titan
to
start
it
think
i
signal
barkovis
to
come
over
and
see
what
he
thinks
about
it
the
titanian
commander
approved
the
idea
and
the
transmitting
field
was
quickly
installed
nadia
insisted
that
she
too
needed
to
work
and
that
she
was
altogether
too
good
a
mechanic
to
waste
therefore
the
two
again
labored
mightily
together
day
after
day
but
the
girl
limited
rigidly
their
hours
of
work
to
those
of
the
working
day
and
evening
after
evening
barkovis
visited
with
them
for
hours
dressed
in
his
heavy
and
supported
by
a
tractor
beam
well
out
of
range
of
what
seemed
to
him
terrific
heat
radiated
by
the
bodies
of
the
terrestrials
he
floated
along
unconcernedly
while
over
the
multiplex
cable
of
the
he
conversed
with
the
man
and
woman
seated
just
inside
the
open
outer
door
of
their
the
titanian
appetite
for
information
was
insatiable
particularly
did
he
relish
everything
pertaining
to
the
earth
and
to
the
other
inner
planets
forever
barred
to
him
and
to
his
kind
in
return
stevens
and
nadia
came
gradually
to
know
the
story
of
the
humanity
of
titan
i
am
glad
beyond
measure
to
have
known
you
barkovis
mused
one
night
your
existence
proves
that
there
is
truth
in
mythology
as
some
of
us
have
always
believed
your
visit
to
titan
will
create
a
furor
in
scientific
circles
for
you
are
impossibility
incarnate
personifications
of
the
preposterous
in
you
wildest
fancy
had
become
commonplace
according
to
many
of
our
scientists
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
you
to
exist
yet
you
say
and
it
must
be
that
there
are
millions
upon
millions
of
similar
beings
think
of
it
venerians
tellurians
martians
the
satellite
dwellers
of
the
lost
and
us
so
similar
mentally
yet
physically
how
different
but
where
does
the
mythology
come
in
thought
nadia
we
have
unthinkably
ancient
legends
which
say
that
once
titan
was
extremely
hot
and
that
our
remote
ancestors
were
beings
of
fire
in
whose
veins
ran
molten
water
instead
of
blood
since
our
recorded
history
goes
back
some
tens
of
thousands
of
saturnian
years
and
since
in
that
long
period
there
has
been
no
measurable
change
in
us
few
of
us
have
believed
in
the
legends
at
all
they
have
been
thought
the
surviving
figments
of
a
barbarous
prehistoric
worship
of
the
sun
however
such
a
condition
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
known
facts
of
cosmogony
and
since
there
actually
exists
such
a
humanity
as
yours
a
humanity
whose
bodily
tissues
actually
composed
largely
of
molten
water
those
ancient
legends
must
indeed
have
been
based
upon
truth
what
an
evolution
century
after
century
of
slowly
decreasing
temperature
one
continuous
struggle
to
adapt
the
physique
to
a
constantly
changing
environment
first
they
must
have
tried
to
maintain
their
high
temperature
by
covering
and
heating
their
then
as
vegetation
died
they
must
have
bred
into
their
plants
the
ability
to
use
as
sap
purely
chemical
liquids
such
as
our
present
natural
fluids
which
also
may
have
been
partly
synthetic
then
instead
of
the
molten
water
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
they
must
have
modified
similarly
the
outer
atmosphere
must
have
made
it
more
reactive
to
compensate
for
the
lowered
temperature
at
which
metabolism
must
take
place
as
titan
grew
colder
and
colder
they
probably
dug
their
cities
deeper
and
ever
deeper
until
humanity
came
finally
to
realize
that
it
must
itself
change
completely
or
perish
utterly
then
we
may
picture
them
as
aiding
evolution
in
changing
their
body
chemistry
for
thousands
and
thousands
of
years
there
must
have
gone
on
the
gradual
adaptation
of
blood
stream
and
tissue
to
more
and
more
volatile
liquids
and
to
lower
and
still
lower
temperatures
this
must
have
continued
until
titan
arrived
at
the
condition
which
has
now
obtained
for
ages
a
condition
of
thermal
equilibrium
with
space
upon
one
hand
and
upon
the
other
the
sun
which
changes
appreciably
only
in
millions
upon
millions
of
years
in
equilibrium
at
last
with
our
bodily
and
atmospheric
temperatures
finally
constant
at
their
present
values
which
seem
as
low
to
you
as
yours
appear
high
to
us
truly
an
evolution
astounding
to
contemplate
but
how
about
power
asked
stevens
you
seem
to
have
all
you
want
and
yet
it
does
stand
to
reason
that
there
could
be
very
much
generated
upon
a
satellite
so
old
and
so
cold
you
are
right
for
ages
there
has
been
but
little
power
produced
upon
titan
many
cycles
ago
however
our
scientists
had
developed
with
which
they
explored
our
neighboring
satellites
and
even
saturn
itself
it
is
from
power
plants
upon
saturn
that
we
draw
energy
their
construction
was
difficult
in
the
extreme
since
the
pioneers
had
to
work
in
braces
because
of
the
enormous
force
of
gravity
then
too
they
had
to
be
protected
from
the
overwhelming
pressure
and
poisonous
qualities
of
the
air
and
insulated
from
a
temperature
far
above
the
melting
point
of
water
in
such
awful
heat
of
course
our
customary
building
material
water
could
not
be
employed
but
all
our
instruments
have
indicated
that
saturn
is
stevens
interrupted
its
surface
temperature
as
read
from
afar
would
be
low
conceded
barkovis
but
the
actual
surface
of
the
planet
is
extremely
hot
and
is
highly
volcanic
practically
none
of
its
heat
is
radiated
because
of
the
great
density
and
depth
of
its
atmosphere
which
extends
for
many
hundreds
of
your
kilometers
it
required
many
thousands
of
lives
and
many
years
of
time
to
build
and
install
those
automatic
power
plants
but
once
they
were
in
operation
we
were
assured
of
power
for
many
tens
of
thousands
of
years
to
come
our
system
of
power
transmission
is
more
or
less
like
yours
but
we
have
anything
like
your
range
suppose
you
be
willing
to
teach
me
the
computation
of
your
fields
yes
we
shall
be
glad
to
give
you
the
formulae
being
an
older
race
it
is
perhaps
natural
that
we
should
have
developed
certain
refinements
as
yet
unknown
to
you
but
i
am
i
perceived
detaining
you
from
your
time
of
rest
goodbye
and
barkovis
was
wafted
back
toward
his
mirrored
globe
what
do
you
make
of
this
chemical
solution
blood
of
theirs
steve
asked
nadia
watching
the
placidly
floating
form
of
the
titanian
captain
not
much
i
may
have
mentioned
before
that
there
are
one
or
two
or
perhaps
even
three
men
who
are
better
chemists
than
i
am
i
gathered
that
it
is
something
like
a
polyhydric
alcohol
and
something
like
a
substituted
hydrocarbon
and
yet
different
from
either
in
that
it
contains
flourin
in
loose
combination
i
think
it
is
something
that
our
tellurian
chemists
have
got
yet
but
they
got
so
many
organic
compounds
now
that
they
may
have
synthesized
it
at
that
you
see
titan
atmosphere
is
nearly
as
dense
as
ours
but
what
there
is
of
it
is
pure
dynamite
ours
is
a
little
oxygen
mixed
with
a
lot
of
inert
ingredients
theirs
is
oxygen
heavily
laced
with
flourin
no
fooling
however
something
pretty
violent
must
be
necessary
to
carry
on
body
reactions
at
such
a
temperature
as
theirs
probably
but
i
know
even
less
about
that
kind
of
thing
than
you
do
funny
is
it
the
way
he
thinks
when
he
means
ice
and
always
thinks
of
our
real
water
as
being
molten
reasonable
enough
when
you
think
about
it
temperature
differences
are
logarithmic
you
know
not
arithmetic
the
effective
difference
between
his
body
temperature
and
ours
is
perhaps
even
greater
than
that
between
ours
and
that
of
melted
iron
we
never
think
of
iron
as
being
a
liquid
you
know
that
right
too
well
good
night
steve
dear
little
queen
of
space
see
you
at
breakfast
and
the
became
dark
and
silent
day
after
day
the
brilliant
sphere
flew
toward
distant
saturn
with
the
wreckage
of
the
in
tow
piece
by
piece
that
wreckage
was
brought
together
and
held
in
place
by
the
titanian
tractors
and
slowly
but
steadily
under
stevens
terrific
welding
projector
the
stubborn
steel
flowed
together
once
more
to
become
a
seamless
spaceworthy
structure
and
nadia
the
electrician
followed
close
behind
the
welder
wielding
torch
pliers
and
spanner
with
practised
hand
she
repaired
or
cut
out
of
circuit
the
damaged
accumulator
cells
and
reunited
the
ends
of
each
severed
power
lead
understanding
nadia
work
thoroughly
the
titanians
were
not
particularly
interested
in
it
but
whenever
stevens
made
his
way
along
an
outside
seam
he
had
a
large
and
thrillingly
horrified
gallery
everyone
who
could
possibly
secure
permission
to
leave
the
sphere
did
so
each
upon
his
own
pencil
of
force
and
went
over
to
watch
the
welder
they
did
not
come
close
to
him
to
venture
within
fifty
feet
of
that
slow
moving
spot
of
scintillating
brilliance
even
in
a
meant
death
but
poised
around
him
in
space
they
watched
with
shuddering
incredulous
amazement
the
monstrous
human
being
in
whose
veins
ran
molten
water
instead
of
blood
whose
body
was
already
so
fiercely
hot
that
it
could
exist
unharmed
while
working
practically
without
protection
upon
metal
finally
the
welding
was
done
the
insulating
space
was
evacuated
and
held
its
vacuum
outer
and
inner
shells
were
the
two
mechanics
heaved
deep
sighs
of
relief
as
they
discarded
their
cumbersome
armor
and
began
to
repair
what
few
of
their
machine
tools
had
been
damaged
by
the
slashing
plane
of
force
which
had
so
neatly
sliced
the
into
sections
say
big
fellow
you
the
guy
that
slings
the
ink
ai
you
nadia
extinguished
her
torch
and
swaggered
up
to
stevens
hands
on
hips
her
walk
an
exaggerated
roll
write
me
out
a
long
walk
this
job
all
played
out
so
i
think
i
get
me
a
good
job
on
titan
i
said
give
me
my
time
you
big
stiff
you
did
say
nothing
growled
stevens
in
his
deepest
bass
playing
up
to
her
lead
as
he
always
did
bounce
back
cub
you
struck
a
rubber
fence
you
signed
on
for
duration
and
you
stick
see
arm
in
arm
they
went
over
to
the
nearest
communicator
plate
flipping
the
switch
stevens
turned
the
dial
and
titan
shone
upon
the
screen
so
close
that
it
no
longer
resembled
a
moon
but
was
a
world
toward
which
they
were
falling
with
an
immense
velocity
not
close
enough
to
make
out
much
detail
yet
let
take
another
look
at
saturn
and
stevens
projected
the
visiray
beam
out
toward
the
mighty
planet
it
was
now
an
enormous
full
moon
almost
five
degrees
in
apparent
diameter
its
visible
surface
an
expanse
of
what
they
knew
to
be
billowing
cloud
shining
brilliantly
white
in
the
pale
sunlight
broken
only
by
a
dark
equatorial
band
footnote
the
moon
subtends
an
angle
of
about
of
a
degree
those
rings
were
a
gorgeous
spectacle
a
little
while
ago
nadia
mourned
it
a
shame
that
titan
has
to
be
right
in
their
plane
it
think
of
living
this
close
to
one
of
the
most
wonderful
sights
in
the
solar
system
and
never
being
able
to
see
it
think
they
know
what
they
missing
steve
we
have
to
ask
barkovis
stevens
replied
he
swung
the
communicator
beam
back
toward
titan
and
nadia
shuddered
oh
it
hideous
she
exclaimed
i
thought
that
it
would
improve
as
we
got
closer
but
the
plainer
we
can
see
it
the
worse
it
gets
just
to
think
of
human
beings
even
such
ones
as
those
over
there
living
upon
such
a
horrible
moon
and
it
gives
me
the
blue
shivers
it
pretty
bleak
no
fooling
he
admitted
and
peered
through
the
eyepiece
of
the
visiray
telescope
studying
minutely
the
forbidding
surface
of
the
satellite
they
were
so
rapidly
approaching
larger
and
larger
it
loomed
a
cratered
jagged
globe
of
desolation
indescribable
of
sheer
bitter
cold
incarnate
and
palpable
of
stark
sharp
contrasts
gigantic
craters
in
whose
yawning
depths
no
spark
of
warmth
had
been
generated
for
countless
cycles
of
time
were
surrounded
by
vast
plains
eroded
to
the
dead
level
of
a
windless
sea
every
lofty
object
cast
a
sharply
outlined
shade
of
impenetrable
blackness
beside
which
the
weak
light
of
the
sun
became
a
dazzling
glare
the
ground
was
either
a
brilliant
white
or
an
intense
black
unrelieved
by
i
ca
hand
it
much
either
nadia
but
it
all
in
the
way
been
brought
up
you
know
this
is
home
to
them
and
just
to
look
at
tellus
would
give
them
the
pip
ha
here
something
you
like
even
if
it
does
look
so
cold
that
it
makes
me
feel
like
hugging
a
couple
of
heater
coils
it
barkovis
city
the
one
we
heading
for
i
think
it
close
enough
now
so
that
we
can
get
it
on
the
plate
and
he
set
the
communicator
beam
upon
the
metropolis
of
titan
why
i
do
see
a
thing
steve
where
and
what
is
it
they
were
dropping
vertically
downward
toward
the
center
of
a
vast
plain
of
white
featureless
and
desolate
and
nadia
stared
in
disappointment
you
see
directly
it
too
good
to
spoil
by
telling
you
what
to
look
for
or
wh
oh
there
it
is
she
cried
it
beautiful
steve
but
how
frightfully
utterly
cold
a
flash
of
prismatic
color
had
caught
the
girl
eye
and
one
transparent
structure
thus
revealed
to
her
sight
there
had
burst
into
view
a
city
of
crystal
low
buildings
of
hexagonal
shape
arranged
in
irregularly
variant
hexagonal
patterns
extended
mile
upon
mile
from
the
roofs
of
the
structures
lacy
spires
soared
heavenward
by
long
slim
cantilever
bridges
whose
prodigious
spans
seemed
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
gossamer
delicacy
of
their
construction
buildings
spires
and
bridges
formed
fantastic
geometrical
designs
at
which
nadia
exclaimed
in
delight
i
just
thought
of
what
that
reminds
me
of
it
snowflakes
sure
i
knew
it
was
something
familiar
snowflakes
no
two
are
ever
exactly
alike
and
yet
every
one
is
symmetrical
and
hexagonal
going
to
land
on
the
public
square
see
the
crowds
let
put
on
our
suits
and
go
out
the
lay
in
a
hexagonal
park
and
near
it
the
titanian
globe
had
also
come
to
rest
all
about
the
little
plot
towered
the
glittering
buildings
of
crystal
and
in
its
center
played
a
fountain
a
series
of
clear
and
sparkling
cascades
of
liquid
jewels
under
foot
there
spread
a
thick
soft
carpet
of
whitely
brilliant
vegetation
throngs
of
the
grotesque
citizens
of
titania
were
massed
to
greet
the
throngs
clustering
close
about
the
globular
vessel
but
maintaining
a
respectful
distance
from
the
fiercely
radiant
terrestrial
wedge
all
were
shouting
greetings
and
congratulations
shouts
which
stevens
found
as
intelligible
as
his
own
native
tongue
why
i
can
understand
every
word
they
say
steve
nadia
exclaimed
in
surprise
how
come
do
you
suppose
i
can
too
do
know
must
be
from
using
that
thought
telephone
of
theirs
so
much
i
guess
here
comes
barkovis
i
ask
him
the
titanian
commander
had
been
in
earnest
conversation
with
a
group
of
and
was
now
walking
toward
the
terrestrials
carrying
the
multiple
headsets
placing
them
upon
the
white
sward
he
backed
away
motioning
the
two
visitors
to
pick
them
up
it
may
not
be
necessary
barkovis
stevens
said
slowly
and
clearly
we
do
not
know
why
but
we
can
understand
what
your
people
are
saying
and
it
may
be
that
you
can
now
understand
us
oh
yes
i
can
understand
your
english
perfectly
a
surprising
development
but
perhaps
after
all
one
that
should
have
been
expected
from
the
very
nature
of
the
device
we
have
been
using
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
have
just
received
grave
news
which
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
help
you
immediately
as
i
promised
while
we
were
gone
one
of
our
two
upon
saturn
failed
in
consequence
titan
power
has
been
cut
to
a
minimum
since
maintaining
our
beam
at
that
great
distance
required
a
large
fraction
of
the
output
of
the
other
plant
because
of
this
lack
the
sedlor
walls
were
weakened
to
such
a
point
that
in
spite
of
the
guardian
assurances
i
think
trouble
is
inevitable
at
all
events
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
that
we
begin
repairing
the
damaged
unit
for
that
is
to
be
a
task
indeed
yes
it
will
take
time
agreed
stevens
remembering
what
the
titanian
captain
had
told
him
concerning
the
construction
of
those
plants
generators
which
had
been
in
continuous
and
automatic
operation
for
thousands
of
saturnian
years
it
will
take
more
than
time
it
will
take
lives
replied
barkovis
gravely
scores
perhaps
hundreds
of
us
will
never
again
breathe
the
clear
pure
air
of
titan
in
spite
of
all
precaution
and
all
possible
bracing
and
insulation
man
after
man
after
man
will
be
crushed
by
his
own
weight
volatilized
by
the
awful
heat
poisoned
by
the
foul
atmosphere
or
will
burst
into
unthinkable
flames
at
the
touch
of
some
flying
spark
from
the
inconceivably
hot
metals
with
which
we
shall
have
to
work
a
horrible
fate
but
we
shall
not
lack
for
volunteers
sure
not
and
of
course
you
yourself
would
go
and
i
never
thought
of
the
effect
a
spark
would
have
on
you
your
tissues
would
probably
be
wildly
inflammable
but
say
i
just
had
a
thought
just
how
hot
is
the
air
at
those
plants
and
just
what
is
the
actual
pressure
according
to
the
records
the
temperature
is
some
forty
of
your
centigrade
degrees
above
the
of
water
and
the
pressure
is
not
far
short
of
two
of
your
meters
of
mercury
i
find
it
almost
impossible
to
think
of
mercury
as
a
liquid
however
you
find
it
impossible
since
you
use
it
as
a
metal
for
wires
in
coils
and
so
on
but
plus
forty
while
pretty
warm
is
impossible
by
any
means
and
we
could
stand
double
our
air
pressure
for
quite
a
while
both
my
partner
and
i
are
pretty
fair
mechanics
and
we
got
quite
a
line
of
machine
tools
such
as
you
could
not
possibly
have
here
give
it
a
whirl
since
we
owe
you
something
already
lead
us
to
it
ace
but
wait
a
minute
we
ca
see
through
the
fog
so
could
find
the
plants
and
probably
your
wiring
diagrams
would
explode
if
i
touched
them
i
never
thought
of
your
helping
us
mused
barkovis
the
idea
of
any
living
being
existing
in
that
inferno
has
always
been
unthinkable
but
the
difficulties
you
mention
are
slight
we
have
already
built
in
our
vessel
communicators
similar
to
yours
and
radio
sets
with
these
we
can
guide
you
and
explain
the
plants
to
you
as
you
work
and
our
tractor
beams
will
be
of
assistance
to
you
in
moving
heavy
objects
even
at
such
distances
from
the
surface
as
we
titanians
shall
have
to
maintain
if
you
will
set
out
a
flask
of
your
atmosphere
we
will
analyze
it
for
the
thought
has
come
to
me
that
perhaps
being
yourselves
the
air
of
saturn
might
not
be
as
poisonous
to
you
as
it
is
to
us
that
a
thought
too
and
the
news
broadcast
it
was
not
long
until
the
two
ships
leaped
into
the
air
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
cheers
and
plaudits
of
a
watching
multitude
in
a
wide
curve
they
sped
toward
saturn
passing
so
close
to
the
enormous
rings
that
the
individual
meteoric
fragments
could
almost
be
seen
with
the
unaided
eye
they
flashed
on
and
on
slowing
down
long
before
they
approached
the
upper
surface
of
the
envelope
of
cloud
the
spherical
stopped
and
stevens
staring
into
his
useless
screen
drove
the
downward
mile
after
mile
solely
under
barkovis
direction
changing
course
and
power
from
time
to
time
as
the
titanian
voice
came
from
the
speaker
at
his
elbow
slower
and
slower
became
the
descent
until
finally
almost
upon
the
broad
flat
roof
of
the
stevens
saw
it
in
his
plate
breathing
deeply
in
relief
he
dropped
quickly
down
upon
a
flat
pavement
neutralized
his
controls
and
turned
to
nadia
well
old
we
here
at
last
now
we
go
out
and
see
what
gone
screwy
with
the
works
remember
that
gravity
is
about
double
normal
here
and
conduct
yourself
accordingly
but
it
supposed
to
be
only
about
she
objected
that
at
the
outer
surface
of
the
atmosphere
he
replied
and
atmosphere
not
like
the
thin
layer
we
got
on
tellus
they
went
into
the
airlock
and
stevens
admitted
air
until
their
suits
began
to
collapse
then
valves
cracked
he
sniffed
cautiously
finally
opening
his
helmet
wide
nadia
followed
suit
and
the
man
laughed
as
she
wrinkled
her
nose
in
disgust
as
two
faint
but
unmistakable
odors
smote
her
olfactory
nerves
i
never
cared
particularly
for
hydrogen
sulphide
and
sulphur
dioxide
either
he
assured
her
but
they
are
strong
enough
to
hurt
us
in
the
short
time
we
be
here
those
titanian
chemists
know
their
stuff
though
he
opened
the
outer
valves
slowly
then
opened
the
door
and
they
stepped
down
upon
the
smooth
solid
floor
which
stevens
examined
carefully
i
thought
so
from
his
story
solid
platinum
this
whole
plant
is
built
of
platinum
iridium
and
noble
alloys
the
only
substances
known
that
will
literally
last
forever
believe
me
ace
of
my
bosom
i
wonder
that
it
cost
them
lives
to
build
it
with
their
conditions
i
do
see
how
they
ever
got
it
built
at
all
before
them
rose
an
immense
cone
of
metal
upon
the
top
of
which
was
situated
the
power
plant
twelve
massive
pillars
supported
a
flat
roof
but
permitted
the
air
to
circulate
freely
throughout
the
one
great
room
which
housed
the
machinery
they
climbed
a
flight
of
stairs
passed
between
two
pillars
and
stared
about
them
there
was
no
noise
no
motion
there
was
nothing
that
move
twelve
enormous
masses
of
metallic
checkerwork
covered
with
wide
cooling
fins
almost
filled
the
vast
hall
from
the
center
of
each
mass
great
leads
extended
out
into
a
clear
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
there
uniting
in
to
form
one
enormous
this
bar
thicker
than
a
man
body
had
originally
curved
upward
to
the
base
of
an
immense
parabolic
structure
of
latticed
bars
now
however
it
was
broken
in
midspan
and
the
two
ends
bent
toward
the
floor
above
their
heads
a
jagged
hole
gaped
in
the
heavy
metal
of
the
roof
and
a
similar
hole
had
been
torn
in
the
floor
the
bar
had
been
broken
and
these
holes
had
been
made
by
some
heavy
body
probably
a
meteorite
falling
with
terrific
velocity
this
is
it
all
right
stevens
spoke
to
distant
barkovis
sure
there
nothing
on
this
beam
if
it
should
be
hot
and
i
should
short
circuit
or
bridge
it
with
my
body
it
would
be
just
too
bad
we
have
made
sure
that
nothing
is
connected
to
it
the
titanian
assured
him
do
you
think
you
can
do
anything
absolutely
we
got
jacks
that
bend
heavier
stuff
than
that
and
after
we
get
it
straightened
the
welding
will
be
easy
but
i
have
to
have
some
metal
shall
i
cut
a
piece
off
the
pavement
outside
that
will
not
be
necessary
you
will
find
ample
stores
of
spare
metal
piled
at
the
base
of
each
pillar
all
x
now
we
get
the
jack
nadia
and
they
went
back
to
their
vessel
finding
that
upon
saturn
their
combined
strength
was
barely
sufficient
to
drag
the
heavy
tool
along
the
floor
stand
aside
please
we
will
place
it
for
you
a
calm
voice
sounded
in
their
ears
and
a
pale
blue
tractor
beam
picked
the
massive
jack
lightly
from
the
floor
and
as
lightly
lifted
it
to
its
place
beneath
the
broken
and
held
it
there
while
stevens
piled
blocks
and
plates
of
platinum
beneath
its
base
well
here
where
i
peel
down
as
far
as
the
law
allows
this
is
going
to
be
real
work
girl
no
fooling
it
help
a
lot
if
this
outfit
were
sending
out
a
few
thousand
instead
of
standing
idle
how
would
that
help
it
a
you
know
works
by
absorbing
heat
the
cold
air
sinks
i
imagine
it
pretty
nearly
blows
a
gale
down
the
side
of
this
cone
when
it
working
and
hot
air
rushes
in
to
take
its
place
i
could
use
a
little
cool
breeze
right
now
and
stevens
stripped
to
the
waist
bent
to
the
lever
of
the
powerful
hydraulic
jack
beads
of
sweat
gathered
upon
his
broad
back
uniting
to
form
tiny
rivulets
and
the
girl
became
highly
concerned
about
him
let
me
help
you
steve
i
pretty
husky
too
you
know
sure
you
are
ace
but
this
is
a
job
for
a
not
a
maiden
of
the
upper
classes
you
can
help
though
by
breaking
out
that
welding
outfit
and
getting
it
ready
while
i
doing
this
bending
to
prepare
for
the
welding
under
the
urge
of
that
mighty
jack
the
ends
of
the
broken
rose
into
place
while
far
off
in
space
the
titanians
clustered
about
their
visiray
screens
watching
in
almost
unbelieving
amazement
the
supernatural
being
who
labored
in
that
reeking
inferno
of
heat
and
poisonous
vapor
who
labored
almost
naked
and
entirely
unprotected
refreshing
himself
from
time
to
time
with
drafts
of
molten
water
all
x
barkovis
that
high
i
guess
stevens
flipped
perspiration
from
his
hot
forehead
with
a
wet
finger
and
straightened
his
weary
back
now
you
can
put
this
jack
away
where
we
had
it
then
you
might
trundle
me
over
enough
of
that
spare
metal
to
fill
up
this
hole
and
i
put
on
my
suit
and
goggles
and
practice
welding
on
this
floor
and
the
roof
to
get
the
feel
of
the
metal
before
i
tackle
the
bar
the
hole
in
the
floor
was
filled
with
scrap
and
soon
sparks
were
flying
wildly
as
the
searing
beam
of
stevens
welding
projector
bit
viciously
into
the
stubborn
alloy
of
noble
metals
fashioning
a
smooth
solid
floor
where
the
yawning
aperture
had
been
then
lifted
with
his
tools
and
plates
to
the
roof
the
man
repaired
that
hole
also
now
i
know
enough
about
it
to
do
a
good
job
on
the
bar
he
decided
and
brick
after
brick
of
alloy
was
fused
into
the
crack
until
only
a
smoothly
rounded
bulge
betrayed
that
a
break
had
ever
existed
in
that
mighty
rod
of
metal
give
the
signal
to
draw
power
and
see
if
that
all
that
was
the
matter
stevens
instructed
as
he
relaxed
in
the
grateful
coolness
of
their
control
room
whew
that
was
a
warm
job
nadia
and
this
air
of
ours
does
smell
good
it
was
a
horrible
job
and
i
glad
it
done
she
declared
but
say
steve
that
thing
looks
as
little
like
a
as
anything
i
can
imagine
how
does
it
work
you
said
that
it
worked
on
heat
but
i
quite
see
how
but
do
draw
diagrams
and
do
integrate
no
ordinary
plant
such
as
we
use
could
run
for
centuries
without
attention
he
replied
this
is
a
highly
advanced
something
like
a
you
know
this
whole
thing
is
simply
the
hot
end
connected
to
the
cold
end
on
titan
by
a
beam
instead
of
wires
when
it
working
this
metal
must
cool
off
something
fierce
that
what
the
checkerwork
and
fins
are
for
so
that
it
can
absorb
the
maximum
amount
of
heat
from
the
current
of
hot
moist
air
i
spoke
about
it
a
sweet
system
we
have
to
rig
up
one
between
tellus
and
the
moon
or
even
between
the
equator
and
the
arctic
circle
there
be
enough
thermal
differential
to
give
us
a
million
kilofranks
we
have
got
the
all
x
signal
yet
but
it
working
look
at
it
sweat
as
it
cools
down
i
say
it
sweating
the
water
is
simply
streaming
off
it
in
their
plate
they
saw
that
moisture
was
already
beginning
to
condense
upon
the
moisture
running
down
the
fins
in
streams
and
creeping
over
the
dull
metal
floor
in
sluggish
sheets
moisture
which
turning
into
ice
in
the
colder
interior
of
the
checkerwork
again
became
fluid
at
the
inrush
of
hot
wet
saturnian
air
there
the
signal
all
x
barkovis
by
the
way
it
condensing
water
it
seems
to
be
functioning
again
perfect
came
the
titanian
enthusiastic
reply
you
two
have
done
more
in
three
short
hours
than
the
entire
force
of
titan
could
have
accomplished
in
months
you
have
earned
and
shall
receive
the
highest
as
you
were
ace
stevens
interrupted
embarrassed
this
job
was
just
like
shooting
fish
down
a
well
for
us
since
you
saved
our
lives
we
owe
you
a
lot
yet
we
coming
out
straight
up
the
shot
upward
through
mile
after
mile
of
steaming
fog
until
at
last
she
broke
through
into
the
light
clear
outer
atmosphere
stevens
located
the
titanian
and
the
two
vessels
once
more
hurtling
together
through
the
ether
toward
titan
he
turned
to
his
companion
take
the
controls
will
you
nadia
think
i
finish
up
the
tube
i
brought
along
a
piece
of
platinum
from
the
power
plant
and
something
that
i
think
is
tantalum
from
barkovis
description
of
it
with
those
and
the
fractions
we
melted
out
i
think
i
can
make
everything
need
now
that
he
had
comparatively
pure
metal
with
which
to
work
drawing
the
leads
and
filaments
was
relatively
a
simple
task
working
over
the
with
torch
and
welding
projector
he
made
short
work
of
running
the
leads
through
the
almost
plastic
glass
of
the
great
tube
and
of
sealing
them
in
place
the
plates
and
grids
presented
more
serious
problems
but
they
were
solved
and
long
before
titan
was
reached
the
tube
was
out
in
space
supported
by
a
titanian
tractor
beam
between
the
two
vessels
stevens
came
into
the
shop
holding
a
modified
mcleod
gauge
which
he
had
just
taken
from
the
interior
of
the
tube
when
it
had
come
to
equilibrium
he
read
it
carefully
and
yelled
eureka
little
fellow
she
down
to
where
i
ca
read
it
even
on
this
big
gauge
so
hard
that
it
wo
need
flashing
harder
than
any
vacuum
i
ever
got
on
tellus
even
with
a
but
how
about
occluded
and
absorbed
gas
in
the
filaments
and
so
on
when
they
heat
up
demanded
nadia
practically
all
gone
ace
i
plenty
out
there
seven
times
almost
to
fusion
there
is
enough
gas
left
in
the
whole
thing
to
make
a
deep
breath
for
a
microbe
he
took
up
his
welding
projector
and
a
beam
carried
him
back
to
the
tube
there
in
the
practically
absolute
vacuum
of
space
the
last
openings
in
the
glass
were
sealed
and
man
and
great
transmitting
tube
were
wafted
lightly
back
into
the
terrestrial
cruiser
hour
after
hour
mirrored
titanian
sphere
and
terrestrial
wedge
bored
serenely
on
through
space
and
it
was
not
until
titan
loomed
large
beneath
them
that
the
calm
was
broken
by
an
insistent
call
from
titan
to
the
sphere
barkodar
attention
barkodar
attention
screamed
from
the
speakers
and
they
heard
barkovis
acknowledge
the
call
the
sedlor
have
broken
through
and
are
marching
upon
titania
the
order
has
gone
out
for
immediate
mobilization
of
every
unit
there
that
word
again
what
are
they
anyway
steve
demanded
nadia
i
do
know
i
was
going
to
ask
him
when
he
sprung
it
on
us
first
but
he
was
pretty
busy
then
and
i
have
thought
of
it
since
something
pretty
serious
though
they
jumped
their
acceleration
almost
to
tellurian
gravity
and
none
of
them
can
live
through
much
of
that
tellurians
came
the
voice
of
barkovis
from
the
speaker
we
have
just
all
x
we
were
on
your
wave
and
heard
it
interrupted
stevens
with
you
what
are
those
sedlor
anyway
maybe
we
can
help
you
dope
out
something
perhaps
but
whatever
you
do
do
not
use
your
that
would
start
a
conflagration
raging
over
the
whole
country
and
we
shall
have
enough
to
do
without
fighting
fire
but
it
may
be
that
you
have
other
weapons
of
which
we
are
ignorant
and
i
can
use
a
little
time
in
explanation
before
we
arrive
the
sedlor
are
a
form
of
life
something
like
your
he
paused
searching
through
his
scanty
store
of
earthly
knowledge
then
went
on
doubtfully
perhaps
some
thing
like
your
insects
they
developed
a
sort
of
intelligence
and
because
of
their
fecundity
adapted
themselves
to
their
environment
as
readily
as
did
man
and
for
ages
they
threatened
man
supremacy
upon
titan
they
devoured
vegetation
crops
animals
and
mankind
after
a
campaign
however
they
were
finally
exterminated
save
in
the
neighborhood
of
one
great
volcanic
crater
which
they
so
honeycombed
that
it
is
almost
impregnable
all
around
that
district
we
have
erected
barriers
of
force
maintained
by
a
corps
of
men
known
as
of
the
sedlor
these
barriers
extend
so
far
into
the
ground
and
so
high
into
the
air
that
the
sedlor
can
neither
burrow
beneath
them
nor
fly
over
them
they
were
being
advanced
as
rapidly
as
possible
and
in
a
few
more
years
the
insects
would
have
been
destroyed
completely
but
now
they
are
again
at
large
they
have
probably
developed
an
armor
or
a
natural
resistance
greater
than
the
guardians
thought
possible
so
that
when
the
walls
were
weakened
they
came
through
in
their
millions
underground
and
undetected
they
are
now
attacking
our
nearest
city
the
one
you
know
and
which
you
have
called
titania
what
do
you
use
those
bombs
the
bombs
were
developed
principally
for
use
against
them
but
proved
worse
than
useless
for
we
found
that
when
a
sedlor
was
blown
to
pieces
each
piece
forthwith
developed
into
a
new
complete
creature
our
most
efficient
weapons
are
our
heat
rays
not
yours
remember
and
poison
gas
i
must
prepare
our
arms
would
our
actually
set
them
afire
steve
nadia
asked
as
the
plate
went
blank
i
say
it
would
i
show
you
what
heat
means
to
them
showing
you
will
be
plainer
than
any
amount
of
explanation
and
he
shot
the
visiray
beam
down
toward
the
city
of
titania
into
a
building
it
went
and
nadia
saw
a
titanian
foundry
in
full
operation
men
clad
in
asbestos
armor
were
charging
tending
and
tapping
great
electric
furnaces
and
crucibles
shrinking
back
and
turning
their
armored
heads
away
as
the
hissing
smoking
melt
crackled
into
the
molds
from
their
ladles
nadia
studied
the
foundry
for
a
moment
interested
but
unimpressed
of
course
it
hot
there
foundries
always
hot
she
argued
yes
but
you
have
got
the
idea
yet
stevens
turned
again
to
the
controls
following
the
sphere
toward
what
was
evidently
a
line
of
battle
that
stuff
that
they
are
melting
and
casting
and
that
is
so
hot
is
not
metal
but
remember
that
the
vital
fluid
of
all
life
here
animal
and
vegetable
corresponding
to
our
water
is
probably
more
inflammable
than
gasoline
if
they
ca
work
on
without
wearing
suits
of
asbestos
what
would
a
real
do
to
them
it
be
about
like
our
taking
a
dive
into
the
sun
she
exclaimed
oh
of
course
but
you
could
really
believe
a
thing
like
that
without
seeing
it
could
you
oh
steve
how
utterly
horrible
the
barkodar
had
dropped
down
into
a
line
of
sister
ships
and
had
gone
into
action
in
midair
against
a
veritable
swarm
of
foes
winged
centipedes
they
were
centipedes
fully
six
feet
long
hurling
themselves
along
the
ground
and
through
the
air
in
furious
hordes
from
the
flying
globes
emanated
pale
beams
of
force
at
the
touch
of
which
the
sedlor
disappeared
in
puffs
of
vapor
upon
the
ground
huge
tractors
and
trucks
manned
by
masked
soldiery
mounted
mighty
reflectors
projecting
the
same
lethal
beam
from
globes
and
tanks
there
sounded
a
drumming
roar
and
small
capsules
broke
in
thousands
among
the
foe
emitting
a
red
cloud
of
gas
in
which
the
centipedes
shriveled
and
died
but
for
each
one
that
was
destroyed
two
came
up
from
holes
in
the
ground
and
the
fell
back
toward
titania
back
toward
a
long
line
of
structures
which
were
sinking
into
the
ground
in
furious
haste
stevens
flashed
on
his
projector
and
swung
it
into
the
thickest
ranks
of
the
enemy
in
the
beam
many
of
the
monsters
died
but
the
terrestrial
ray
was
impotent
compared
with
the
weapons
of
the
titanians
and
stevens
snapping
off
the
beam
with
a
bitter
imprecation
shot
the
visiray
out
toward
the
bare
black
cone
of
the
extinct
volcano
and
studied
it
with
care
barkovis
i
got
a
thought
he
snapped
into
the
microphone
their
stronghold
is
in
that
mountain
and
there
millions
of
them
in
there
yet
coming
out
along
their
tunnels
they
got
all
the
vegetation
eaten
away
for
miles
so
there
nothing
much
left
there
to
spread
a
fire
if
i
go
to
work
on
that
hill
and
i
probably
melt
enough
water
to
put
out
most
of
the
fires

drop
your

may

about
at

about

the
darted
toward
the
crater
followed
closely
by
two
of
the
dazzling
globes
they
circled
the
mountain
until
stevens
found
a
favorable
point
of
attack
a
stupendous
vertical
cliff
of
mingled
rock
and
crystal
upon
the
base
of
which
he
trained
his
terrific
projector
i
going
to
draw
a
lot
of
power
he
warned
the
titanians
then
giving
this
gun
everything
she
take
he
drove
the
massive
switches
in
and
as
that
dull
red
beam
struck
the
cliff
base
there
was
made
evident
the
awful
effect
of
a
concentrated
beam
of
real
and
pure
heat
upon
such
an
utterly
frigid
world
vast
columns
of
fire
roared
aloft
helping
stevens
melting
and
destroying
the
very
ground
as
the
bodies
of
the
sedlor
in
that
gigantic
burst
into
flames
clouds
of
superheated
steam
roared
upward
condensing
into
a
hot
rain
which
descended
in
destructive
torrents
upon
the
fastnesses
of
the
centipedes
as
the
raging
beam
ate
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
base
of
the
cliff
the
mountain
itself
began
to
disintegrate
block
after
gigantic
block
breaking
off
and
crashing
down
into
the
flaming
boiling
seething
cauldron
which
was
the
apex
of
that
ravening
beam
hour
after
hour
stevens
drove
his
intolerable
weapon
into
the
great
mountain
teeming
with
sedlorean
life
and
hour
after
hour
a
group
of
titanian
spheres
stood
by
deluging
the
surrounding
plain
with
a
flood
of
heavy
fumes
through
which
the
holocaust
could
not
spread
for
lack
of
oxygen
not
until
the
mountain
was
gone
not
until
in
its
stead
there
lay
a
furiously
boiling
lake
its
flaming
surface
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
level
of
the
plain
did
stevens
open
his
power
circuits
and
point
the
deformed
prow
of
the
toward

barkovis
asked
slowly
and
thoughtfully
he
was
sitting
upon
a
crystal
bench
beside
the
fountain
talking
with
stevens
who
dressed
in
his
bulging
stood
near
an
airlock
of
the
it
seems
a
shame
that
you
should
face
again
those
unknown
monstrous
creatures
who
so
inexcusably
attacked
us
both
without
provocation
i
not
so
keen
on
it
myself
but
i
ca
see
any
other
way
out
of
it
the
terrestrial
replied
we
left
a
lot
of
our
equipment
there
you
know
and
even
if
i
should
build
duplicates
here
it
would
do
us
any
good
these
are
the
most
powerful
transmitting
tubes
known
when
we
left
tellus
but
even
their
fields
dense
as
they
are
hold
an
together
much
farther
than
about
six
astronomical
units
so
you
see
we
ca
possibly
reach
our
friends
from
here
with
this
tube
and
your
system
of
beam
transmission
wo
hold
anything
together
even
that
far
and
wo
work
on
any
wave
shorter
than
rays
we
may
run
into
some
more
of
those
little
spheres
though
and
i
do
like
the
prospect
i
wonder
if
we
could
plate
a
layer
of
that
mirror
of
yours
upon
the
and
carry
along
a
few
of
those
bombs
by
the
way
what
is
that
explosive
or
is
it
something
beyond
tellurian
chemistry
its
structure
should
be
clear
to
you
although
you
probably
could
not
prepare
it
upon
tellus
because
of
your
high
temperature
it
is
nothing
but
nitrogen
atoms
of
nitrogen
combined
to
form
one
molecule
of
what
you
would
call
wow
stevens
whistled
crystalline
pentavalent
nitrogen
no
wonder
it
violent
we
could
of
course
cover
your
vessel
with
the
mirror
but
i
am
afraid
that
it
would
prove
of
little
value
the
plates
are
so
hot
that
it
would
soon
volatilize
not
necessarily
argued
stevens
we
could
live
in
number
one
and
shut
off
the
heat
everywhere
else
the
are
insulated
from
the
structure
proper
and
the
inner
and
outer
walls
of
the
structure
are
insulated
from
each
other
with
only
the
headquarters
lifeboat
warm
the
outer
wall
could
be
held
pretty
close
to
zero
absolute
that
is
true
the
bombs
of
course
are
controlled
by
radio
and
therefore
may
be
attached
to
the
outer
wall
of
your
vessel
we
shall
be
glad
to
do
these
small
things
for
you
the
heaters
of
the
were
shut
off
and
as
soon
as
the
outer
shell
had
cooled
to
titanian
temperature
a
corps
of
mechanics
set
to
work
a
machine
very
like
a
concrete
mixer
was
rolled
up
beside
the
steel
vessel
and
into
its
capacious
maw
were
dumped
boxes
and
barrels
of
dry
ingredients
and
many
cans
of
sparkling
liquid
the
resultant
paste
was
pumped
upon
the
steel
plating
in
a
sluggish
viscid
stream
which
spread
out
into
a
thick
and
uniform
coating
beneath
the
flying
rollers
of
the
skilled
titanian
workmen
as
it
hardened
the
paste
smoothed
magically
into
the
perfect
mirror
which
covered
the
of
the
satellite
and
a
full
dozen
of
the
mirror
explosive
bombs
of
this
strange
people
were
hung
in
the
racks
already
provided
once
again
i
must
caution
you
concerning
those
torpedoes
barkovis
warned
stevens
if
you
use
them
all
very
well
but
do
not
try
to
take
even
one
of
them
into
any
region
where
it
is
very
hot
for
it
will
explode
and
demolish
your
vessel
if
you
do
not
use
them
destroy
them
before
you
descend
into
the
hot
atmosphere
of
ganymede
the
mirror
will
volatilize
harmlessly
at
the
temperature
of
melting
mercury
but
the
torpedoes
must
be
destroyed
once
more
tellurians
we
thank
you
for
what
you
have
done
and
wish
you
well
thanks
a
lot
for
help
we
still
owe
you
something
replied
stevens
if
either
of
your
go
sour
on
you
again
or
if
you
need
any
more
built
be
sure
to
let
us
know
you
can
come
close
enough
to

inner

now
on
your

to
talk
to

cold

of

himself
of

nadia
lifted

we
off

said

the

agreed
sure
everything
all
x

to

decimals
he
declared
you
could
squeeze
another
frank
into
our
accumulators
with
a
and
since
they
sending
us
all
the
power
we
want
to
draw
we
wo
need
to
touch
our
batteries
or
tap
our
own
beam
until
we
almost
to
jupiter
to
cap
the
climax
what
it
takes
to
make
big
medicine
on
those
spherical
friends
of
ours
got
we
not
sitting
on
top
of
the
world
ace
we
perched
exactly
at
the
apex
of
the
entire
universe
how
long
is
it
going
to
take
do
know
have
figured
it
yet
but
it
be
days
and
the
two
wanderers
from
earth
settled
down
to
the
routine
of
a
long
and
uneventful
journey
they
gave
saturn
and
his
spectacular
rings
a
wide
berth
and
sped
on
with
velocity
past
the
outer
satellites
on
and
on
the
good
ship
flew
into
the
depths
of
interplanetary
space
saturn
was
an
disk
beneath
them
above
them
was
jupiter
thin
crescent
growing
ever
larger
and
more
bright
and
the
monarch
of
the
solar
system
remaining
almost
stationary
day
after
day
increasing
steadily
in
apparent
diameter
and
in
brilliance
although
the
voyage
from
titan
to
ganymede
was
long
it
was
not
monotonous
for
there
was
much
work
to
be
done
in
the
designing
and
fabrication
of
the
various
units
which
were
to
comprise
the
transmitting
station
in
the
various
compartments
of
the
there
were
sundry
small
motors
blowers
coils
condensers
generators
and
other
items
which
stevens
could
use
with
little
or
no
alteration
but
for
the
most
part
he
had
to
build
everything
himself
thus
it
was
that
time
passed
quickly
so
quickly
that
jupiter
loomed
large
and
the
saturnian
beam
of
power
began
to
attenuate
almost
before
the
terrestrials
realized
that
their
journey
was
drawing
to
an
end
our
beam
falling
apart
fast
stevens
read
his
meters
carefully
then
swung
his
communicator
beam
toward
jupiter
we
are
getting
quite
enough
power
to
hold
our
acceleration
at
normal
think
i
cut
now
while
we
still
drawing
enough
to
let
the
titanians
know
we
off
their
beam
we
got
lots
of
power
of
our
own
now
and
we
getting
pretty
close
to
enemy
territory
so
they
may
locate
that
heavy
beam
have
you
found
ganymede
yet
yes
it
will
be
on
the
other
side
of
jupiter
by
the
time
we
get
there
shall
i
detour
or
put
on
a
little
more
negative
and
wait
for
it
to
come
around
to
this
side
better
wait
i
think
the
farther
away
we
stay
from
jupiter
and
the
major
satellites
the
better
all
x
it
on
suppose
we
better
start
standing
watches
in
case
some
of
them
show
up
no
use
he
dissented
i
been
afraid
to
put
out
our
electromagnetic
detectors
as
they
could
surely
trace
them
in
use
without
them
we
could
spot
an
enemy
ship
even
if
we
were
looking
right
at
it
except
by
accident
since
they
wo
be
lighted
up
and
it
awfully
hard
to
see
anything
out
here
anyway
we
probably
know
they
within
a
million
kilometers
until
they
put
a
beam
on
us
barkovis
says
that
this
mirror
will
reflect
any
beam
they
can
use
and
i
already
got
a
set
of
in
circuit
to
ring
an
alarm
at
the
first
flash
off
of
our
mirror
plating
i
like
to
get
in
the
first
licks
myself
but
i
have
been
able
to
dope
out
any
way
of
doing
it
so
you
might
as
well
sleep
in
your
own
room
as
usual
and
i
camp
here
right
under
the
panel
until
we
get
to
ganymede
there
a
couple
of
little
things
i
just
thought
of
though
that
may
help
some
and
i
going
to
do
right
now
putting

he
picked
up
a
power
drill
and
went
out
into
the
bitter
cold
of
the
outer
structure
there
he
attacked
the
inner
wall
of
their
vessel
and
the
carefully
established
vacuum
disappeared
in
a
screaming
hiss
of
air
as
the
tempered
point
bit
through
plate
after
plate
what
the
idea
steve
nadia
asked
when
he
had
the
control
room
now
you
have
all
that
pumping
to
do
over
again
protection
for
the
mirrors
he
explained
you
see
they
perfect
reflectors
there
a
little
absorption
so
that
some
stuff
comes
through
not
much
of
course
but
enough
to
kill
some
of
those
titanians
and
almost
enough
to
ruin
their
ship
got
through
in
about
ten
minutes
and
only
one
enemy
was
dealing
it
out
we
can
stand
more
than
they
could
of
course
but
the
mirror
itself
wo
stand
much
more
heat
than
it
was
absorbing
then
but
with
air
in
those
spaces
instead
of
vacuum
and
with
the
whole
mass
of
the
except
this
one
lifeboat
as
cold
as
it
is
i
figure
that
there
be
enough
conduction
and
convection
through
them
to
keep
the
outer
wall
and
the
mirror
cold
cool
enough
at
least
to
hold
the
mirror
on
for
an
hour
if
only
one
ship
tackles
us
it
wo
be
bad
but
i
figure
that
if
there
only
one
we
lucky
stevens
fears
were
only
too
well
grounded
for
during
the
evening
of
the
following
day
while
he
was
carefully
scanning
the
heavens
for
some
sign
of
enemy
craft
the
alarm
bell
over
his
head
burst
into
its
brazen
clamor
instantly
he
shot
out
the
detectors
and
and
saw
not
one
but
six
of
the
deadly
globes
almost
upon
them
at
range
one
was
already
playing
a
beam
of
force
upon
the
and
the
other
five
went
into
action
immediately
upon
feeling
the
detector
impulses
and
perceiving
that
the
weapon
of
their
sister
ship
had
encountered
an
unusual
resistance
in
the
material
of
that
peculiarly
mirrored
wedge
as
those
terrific
forces
struck
her
the
terrestrial
cruiser
became
a
vast
pyrotechnic
set
piece
a
dazzling
fountain
of
coruscant
brilliance
for
the
mirror
held
the
enemy
beams
shot
back
upon
themselves
and
rebounded
in
all
directions
in
the
same
spectacular
exhibition
of
frenzied
incandescence
which
had
marked
the
resistance
of
the
titanian
sphere
to
a
similar
attack
but
stevens
was
not
idle
in
the
instant
of
launching
his
detectors
as
fast
as
he
could
work
the
trips
four
of
the
frightful
nitrogen
bombs
of
titan
all
that
he
could
handle
at
once
shot
out
into
space
their
flaring
viciously
the
enemy
detectors
of
course
located
the
flying
torpedoes
immediately
but
contemptuous
of
material
projectiles
the
spheres
made
no
attempt
to
dodge
but
merely
lashed
out
upon
them
with
their
ravening
rays
so
close
was
the
range
that
they
had
no
time
to
avoid
the
bombs
after
discovering
that
their
beams
were
useless
against
the
unknown
protective
covering
of
those
mirrored
shells
there
were
four
practically
simultaneous
detonations
silent
but
terrific
explosions
as
the
internal
energy
of
solid
pentavalent
nitrogen
was
instantaneously
released
and
the
four
insensately
murderous
spheres
disappeared
into
jagged
fragments
of
wreckage
flying
wildly
away
from
the
centers
of
explosion
one
great
mass
of
riven
and
twisted
metal
was
blown
directly
upon
the
fifth
globe
and
nadia
stared
in
horrified
fascination
at
the
silent
crash
as
the
entire
side
of
the
ship
crumpled
inward
like
a
shell
of
cardboard
under
the
awful
impact
that
vessel
was
probably
out
of
action
but
stevens
was
taking
no
chances
as
soon
as
he
had
clamped
a
pale
blue
tractor
rod
upon
the
sixth
and
last
of
the
enemy
fleet
he
drove
a
torpedo
through
the
gaping
wall
and
into
the
interior
of
the
helpless
there
he
exploded
it
and
the
awful
charge
detonated
in
that
confined
space
literally
tore
the
globular
to
bits
we
show
these
jaspers
what
kind
of
trees
make
shingles
he
gritted
between
clenched
teeth
and
his
eyes
hard
now
as
gray
iron
fairly
emitted
sparks
as
he
launched
four
torpedoes
upon
the
sole
remaining
globe
of
the
squadron
of
the
void
i
had
a
lot
of
curiosity
to
know
just
what
kind
of
unnatural
monstrosities
can
possibly
have
such
fiendish
dispositions
as
they
got
but
beasts
men
or
devils
find
they
grabbed
something
this
time
they
ca
let
go
of
and
fierce
blasts
of
energy
ripped
from
the
exhausts
as
he
drove
his
missiles
at
their
highest
possible
acceleration
toward
the
captive
sphere
so
savagely
struggling
at
the
extremity
of
his
tractor
beam
but
that
one
remaining
vessel
was
to
prove
no
such
easy
victim
as
had
its
sister
ships
being
six
to
one
and
supposedly
invincible
the
squadron
had
been
overconfident
and
had
attacked
carelessly
with
only
its
crippling
slicing
beams
instead
of
its
more
deadly
weapons
of
total
destruction
and
so
fierce
and
hard
had
been
stevens
that
five
of
its
numbers
had
been
destroyed
before
they
realized
what
powerful
armament
was
mounted
by
that
apparently
crude
helpless
and
innocuous
wedge
the
sixth
however
was
fully
warned
and
every
resource
at
the
command
of
its
hellish
crew
was
now
being
directed
against
the
sheets
cones
and
gigantic
rods
of
force
flashed
and
crackled
space
was
filled
with
silent
devastating
tongues
of
flame
the
was
dragged
about
erratically
as
the
sphere
tried
to
dodge
those
hurtling
torpedoes
tried
to
break
away
from
the
hawser
of
energy
anchoring
her
so
solidly
to
her
opponent
but
the
linkage
held
and
closer
and
closer
stevens
drove
the
fourfold
menace
of
his
frightful
dirigible
bombs
pressor
beams
beat
upon
them
in
vain
hard
driven
as
those
pushers
were
they
could
find
no
footing
but
were
reflected
at
many
angles
by
that
untouchable
mirror
and
their
utmost
force
scarcely
impeded
the
progress
of
the
missiles
comparatively
small
as
the
projectiles
were
however
they
soon
felt
the
effects
of
the
prodigious
beams
of
heat
enveloping
them
and
torpedo
after
torpedo
exploded
harmlessly
in
space
as
their
mirrors
warmed
up
and
volatilized
but
for
each
bomb
that
was
lost
stevens
launched
another
and
each
one
came
closer
to
its
objective
than
had
its
predecessor
made
desperate
by
the
failure
of
his
every
beam
the
enemy
commander
thought
to
use
material
projectiles
himself
weapons
abandoned
long
since
by
his
race
as
antiquated
and
inefficient
but
a
few
of
which
were
still
carried
by
the
older
types
of
vessels
one
such
shell
was
found
and
launched
but
in
the
instant
of
its
launching
stevens
foremost
bomb
struck
its
mark
and
exploded
so
close
were
the
other
three
bombs
that
they
also
let
go
at
the
shock
and
the
warlike
sphere
hemmed
in
by
four
centers
of
explosions
flew
apart
literally
pulverized
its
projectile
so
barely
discharged
did
not
explode
it
was
loaded
with
material
which
could
be
detonated
only
by
the
warhead
upon
impact
or
by
a
radio
signal
it
was
however
deflected
markedly
from
its
course
by
the
force
of
the
blast
so
that
instead
of
striking
the
in
direct
central
impact
its
head
merely
touched
the
apex
of
the
wedge
that
touch
was
enough
there
was
another
appalling
concussion
another
blinding
glare
and
the
entire
front
quarter
of
the
terrestrial
vessel
had
gone
to
join
the
shattered
globes
between
the
point
of
explosion
and
the
lifeboats
there
had
been
many
channels
of
insulation
many
bulkheads
many
and
compartment
after
compartment
of
accumulator
cells
these
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
explosion
so
that
the
control
room
was
unharmed
and
stevens
swung
his
communicator
rapidly
through
the
damaged
portions
of
the
vessels
how
badly
are
we
hurt
steve
can
we
make
it
to
ganymede
nadia
was
quietly
staring
over
his
shoulder
into
the
plate
studying
with
him
the
pictures
of
destruction
there
portrayed
as
he
flashed
the
projector
from
compartment
to
compartment
we
hurt
no
fooling
but
it
might
have
been
a
lot
worse
he
replied
as
he
completed
the
survey
we
lost
about
all
of
our
accumulators
but
we
can
land
on
our
own
beam
and
landing
power
is
all
we
want
i
think
you
see
we
drifting
straight
for
where
ganymede
will
be
and
we
better
cut
out
every
bit
of
power
we
using
even
the
heaters
until
we
get
there
this
lifeboat
will
hold
heat
for
quite
a
while
and
i
rather
get
pretty
cold
than
meet
any
more
of
that
gang
i
figured
eight
hours
just
before
they
met
us
and
we
were
just
about
drifting
then
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
seven
hours
blind
but
ca
they
detect
us
anyway
they
may
have
sent
out
a
call
you
know
if
we
are
using
any
power
for
anything
their
electromagnetics
are
the
only
things
we
register
on
and
they
mighty
finders
even
if
they
should
get
that
close
to
us
they
probably
think
we
meteoric
since
we
be
dead
to
their
other
instruments
luckily
we
got
lots
of
air
so
the
chemical
purifiers
can
handle
it
without
power
i
shut
off
everything
and
we
drift
it
could
do
much
of
anything
anyway
even
our
shop
out
there
wo
hold
air
but
we
can
have
light
we
got
acetylene
emergency
lamps
you
know
and
we
do
need
to
economize
on
oxygen
perhaps
we
better
run
in
the
dark
remember
what
you
told
me
about
their
possible
visirays
and
that
you
got
only
two
bombs
left
all
x
that
would
be
better
if
i
forget
it
remind
me
to
blow
up
those
before
we
hit
the
atmosphere
of
ganymede
will
you
he
opened
all
the
power
switches
and
every
source
of
ethereal
vibrations
cut
off
the
drifted
slowly
on
now
appearing
forlorn
indeed
seven
hours
dragged
past
seven
hours
during
which
the
two
sat
tense
expecting
they
knew
not
what
talking
only
at
intervals
and
in
subdued
tones
stevens
then
snapped
on
the
communicator
beam
just
long
enough
to
take
an
observation
upon
ganymede
several
such
brief
glimpses
were
taken
then
after
a
warning
word
to
his
companion
he
sent
out
and
exploded
the
nitrogen
bombs
he
then
threw
on
the
power
and
the
vessel
leaped
toward
the
satellite
under
full
acceleration
close
to
the
atmosphere
it
slanted
downward
in
a
screaming
drive
and
soon
the
mangled
wedge
dropped
down
into
the
little
canyon
which
for
so
long
had
been
home
well
colonel
home
again
stevens
exulted
as
he
neutralized
the
controls
there
that
falls
our
power
plant
the
catapults
everything
now
unless
something
interrupts
us
again
we
run
up
our
radio
tower
and
give
brandon
the
long
yell
how
much
more
have
you
got
to
do
before
you
can
start
sending
not
an
awful
lot
everything
built
all
i
got
to
do
is
assemble
it
i
should
be
able
to
do
it
easily
in
a
week
hope
nothing
else
happens
if
i
drag
you
into
any
more
such
messes
as
those
we
just
been
getting
out
of
by
the
skin
of
our
teeth
i
begin
to
wish
that
we
had
started
out
at
first
to
drift
it
back
to
tellus
in
the
let
see
how
much
time
we
got
we
should
start
shooting
one
day
after
an
eclipse
so
that
we
have
five
days
to
send
you
see
we
do
want
to
point
our
beam
too
close
to
jupiter
or
to
any
of
the
large
satellites
because
the
enemy
might
live
there
and
might
intercept
it
we
had
an
eclipse
yesterday
so
one
week
from
today
at
sunrise
i
start
shooting
but
earth
an
evening
star
now
you
ca
see
it
in
the
morning
i
not
going
to
aim
at
tellus
i
shooting
at
brandon
and
he
never
there
for
more
than
a
week
or
two
at
a
stretch
they
prowling
around
out
in
space
somewhere
almost
all
the
time
then
how
can
you
possibly
hope
to
hit
them
it
may
be
quite
a
job
of
hunting
but
not
as
bad
as
you
might
think
they
probably
are
much
if
any
outside
the
orbit
of
mars
and
they
usually
stay
within
a
couple
of
million
kilometers
or
so
of
the
ecliptic
so
we
start
at
the
sun
and
shoot
our
beam
in
a
spiral
to
cover
that
field
we
ought
to
be
able
to
hit
them
inside
of
twelve
hours
but
if
we
do
we
widen
our
spiral
and
keep
on
trying
until
we
do
hit
them
heavens
steve
are
you
planning
on
telegraphing
steadily
for
days
at
a
time
sure
but
not
by
hand
of
course
i
have
an
automatic
sender
and
automatic
pointers
stevens
had
at
his
command
a
very
complete
he
had
an
ample
supply
of
power
and
all
that
remained
for
him
to
do
was
to
assemble
the
parts
which
he
had
built
during
the
long
journey
from
titan
to
ganymede
therefore
at
sunrise
of
the
designated
day
he
was
ready
and
with
nadia
hanging
breathless
over
his
shoulder
he
closed
the
switch
a
toothed
wheel
engaged
a
delicate
interrupter
and
a
light
sounder
began
its
strident
chatter
ganymede
point
oh
four
seven
ganymede
point
oh
four
seven
ganymede
point
oh
four
seven
endlessly
the
message
was
poured
out
into
the
ether
carried
by
a
tight
beam
of
and
driven
by
forces
sufficient
to
propel
it
well
beyond
the
opposite
limits
of
the
orbit
of
mars
what
does
it
say
i
ca
read
code
stevens
translated
the
brief
message
but
nadia
remained
unimpressed
but
it
does
say
anything
she
protested
it
is
addressed
to
anybody
it
is
signed
it
does
tell
anybody
anything
about
anything
it
all
there
ace
you
see
since
the
beam
is
moving
sidewise
very
rapidly
at
that
range
and
we
shooting
at
a
small
target
the
message
has
to
be
very
short
or
they
wo
get
it
all
while
the
beam
on
it
is
as
though
we
were
broadcasting
it
does
need
any
address
because
nobody
but
the
can
receive
it
except
possibly
the
jovians
they
know
who
sending
it
without
any
signature
it
tells
them
that
ganymede
wants
to
receive
a
message
on
the
centering
on
thousandths
is
that
enough
maybe
but
suppose
some
of
them
live
right
here
on
ganymede
be
shooting
right
through
the
ground
all
night
or
suppose
that
even
if
they
do
live
here
that
they
can
find
our
beam
some
way
or
suppose
that
brandon
has
got
his
machine
built
yet
or
suppose
that
it
turned
on
when
our
beam
passes
them
or
suppose
they
asleep
then
a
lot
of
things
might
happen
not
so
many
ace
your
first
objection
is
the
only
one
that
has
got
more
holes
in
it
than
a
sieve
so
i
take
it
first
since
our
beam
is
only
a
meter
in
diameter
here
and
does
spread
much
in
the
first
few
million
kilometers
the
chance
of
direct
reception
by
the
enemy
even
if
they
do
live
here
on
ganymede
is
infinitesimally
small
but
i
believe
that
they
live
here
at
least
they
certainly
did
land
on
this
satellite
as
you
suggest
however
it
is
conceivable
that
they
may
have
detector
screens
delicate
enough
to
locate
our
beam
at
a
distance
but
since
in
all
probability
that
means
a
distance
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
kilometers
i
think
it
highly
improbable
we
got
to
take
the
same
risk
anyway
no
matter
what
we
do
whenever
we
start
to
use
any
kind
of
driving
power
so
there
no
use
worrying
about
it
as
for
your
last
two
objections
i
know
brandon
and
i
know
westfall
brandon
will
have
receivers
built
that
will
take
in
any
wave
possible
of
propagation
and
westfall
the
cautious
old
egg
will
have
them
running
hours
a
day
with
automatic
recorders
finders
and
everything
else
that
brandon
can
invent
and
believe
me
sweetheart
that
a
lot
of
stuff
it
wonderful
the
way
you
three
men
are
replied
nadia
thoughtfully
reading
between
the
lines
of
stevens
utterance
they
knew
that
you
were
on
the
of
course
and
they
knew
that
if
you
were
alive
you
manage
in
some
way
to
get
in
touch
with
them
and
you
away
out
here
after
all
this
time
are
superbly
confident
that
they
are
expecting
a
call
from
you
that
i
think
is
one
of
the
finest
things
i
ever
heard
of
they
two
of
the
world
best
absolutely
nadia
looked
at
him
surprised
for
he
had
not
seen
anything
complimentary
to
himself
in
her
remark
wait
until
you
meet
them
they
men
nadia
real
men
and
speaking
of
meeting
them
please
try
to
keep
on
loving
me
after
you
meet
norm
brandon
will
you
do
be
a
simp
her
brown
eyes
met
his
steadily
you
did
mean
that
you
did
even
say
it
did
you
back
it
comes
sweetheart
but
knowing
myself
and
knowing
those
two
stop
it
if
norman
brandon
or
quincy
westfall
had
been
here
instead
of
you
or
both
of
them
together
we
have
been
here
from
now
on
we
would
even
have
gotten
away
from
the
jovians
now
it
your
turn
to
back
water
guy
well
maybe
a
little
if
both
of
them
were
here
they
ought
to
equal
you
in
some
things
brandon
says
himself
that
he
and
westfall
together
make
one
scientist
dad
says
he
says
so
you
do
want
to
believe
everything
you
hear
neither
of
them
will
admit
that
he
knows
anything
or
can
do
anything
that
the
way
they
are
dad
has
told
me
a
lot
about
them
how
they
always
been
together
ever
since
their
undergraduate
days
how
they
studied
together
all
over
the
world
even
after
they
been
given
all
the
degrees
loose
how
they
even
went
to
the
other
planets
to
study
to
mars
where
they
had
to
live
in
all
the
time
and
to
venus
where
they
had
to
take
treatments
every
day
to
keep
alive
how
they
learned
everything
that
everybody
else
knew
and
then
went
out
into
space
to
find
out
things
that
nobody
else
ever
dreamed
of
how
you
came
to
join
them
and
what
you
three
have
done
since
they
fine
of
course
but
they
are
she
concluded
passionately
no
thank
heaven
i
know
you
love
me
nadia
just
as
i
love
you
you
know
i
never
doubted
it
but
you
like
them
really
they
a
wonderful
team
brandon
a
big
brute
you
know
fully
five
centimeters
taller
than
i
am
and
he
weighs
close
to
a
hundred
kilograms
and
no
lard
either
he
wild
impetuous
always
jumping
at
conclusions
and
working
out
theories
that
seem
absolutely
ridiculous
but
usually
sound
even
though
impractical
westfall
the
practical
member
he
makes
norm
pipe
down
pins
him
down
to
facts
and
makes
it
possible
to
put
his
hunches
and
wild
flashes
of
genius
into
workable
form
quince
is
a
now
pipe
down
i
heard
you
rave
much
about
those
two
lots
rather
rave
about
you
and
with
more
reason
i
wish
that
sounder
would
start
sounding
our
first
message
has
gone
half
way
yet
it
takes
about
forty
minutes
for
the
impulse
to
get
to
where
i
think
they
are
so
that
even
if
they
got
the
first
one
and
answered
it
instantly
it
would
be
eighty
minutes
before
we
get
it
i
sort
of
expect
an
answer
late
tonight
but
i
wo
be
disappointed
if
it
takes
a
week
to
locate
them
i
will
declared
the
girl
and
indeed
very
little
work
was
done
that
day
by
either
of
the
castaways
slowly
the
day
wore
on
and
the
receiving
sounder
remained
silent
supper
was
eaten
as
the
sun
dropped
low
and
disappeared
but
they
felt
no
desire
to
sleep
instead
they
went
out
in
front
of
the
steel
wall
where
stevens
built
a
small
campfire
leaning
back
against
the
wall
of
their
vessel
they
fell
into
companionable
silence
which
was
suddenly
broken
by
stevens
nadia
i
just
had
a
thought
i
bet
four
dollars
i
wasted
a
lot
of
time
they
certainly
have
automatic
relays
on
tellus
to
save
me
the
trouble
of
hunting
for
them
but
like
an
idiot
i
never
thought
of
it
until
just
this
minute
in
spite
of
the
speech
i
made
you
about
them
i
going
to
change
those
directors
right
now
that
quite
a
job
is
it
no
only
a
few
minutes
do
it
in
the
morning
you
done
enough
for
one
day
maybe
you
hit
them
already
any
way
they
again
became
silent
watching
jupiter
an
enormous
moon
some
seven
degrees
in
apparent
diameter
steve
i
simply
ca
get
used
to
such
a
prodigious
moon
look
at
the
stripes
and
look
at
that
perfectly
incredible
a
gong
sounded
and
they
both
jumped
to
their
feet
and
raced
madly
into
the
the
had
come
to
life
and
the
sounder
was
chattering
insanely
someone
was
sending
with
terrific
speed
but
with
perfect
definition
and
spacing
that
brandon
fist
i
know
his
style
anywhere
stevens
shouted
as
he
seized
notebook
and
pencil
tell
me
what
it
says
quick
steve
nadia
implored
ca

stevens
snapped
his

flying
over

intercepted
and

personally
i
think
such

impossible
and
that
he
is
wilder
than
a

but
just
in
case
they
should
be
supernaturally
intelligent
stevens
stopped
abruptly
and
stared
at
the
vociferous
sounder
do
stop
to
listen
keep
on
writing
commanded
nadia
ca
replied
the
puzzled
mathematician
it
does
make
sense
it
sounds
intelligent
it
made
up
of
real
symbols
of
some
kind
or
other
but
they
do
mean
a
thing
to
me
oh
i
see
he
sending
mush
on

read
the
last
phrase
oh
sure
is
right
and
with
no
perceptible
break
the
signals
again
became
intelligible
if
they
can
translate
that
they
are
better
scholars
than
we
are
signing
off
until
hear
from
you
brandon
the
sounder
died
abruptly
into
silence
and
nadia
sobbed
convulsively
as
she
threw
herself
into
stevens
arms
the
long
strain
over
the
terrible
uncertainty
at
last
dispelled
they
were
both
incoherent
for
a
minute
nadia
glorifying
the
exploits
of
her
lover
stevens
crediting
the
girl
herself
and
his
two
with
whatever
success
had
been
achieved
a
measure
of
regained
stevens
cut
off
his
automatic
sender
changed
the
adjustments
of
his
directors
and
cut
in
his
manually
operated
sending
key
what
waves
are
you
using
anyway
asked
nadia
curiously
they
must
be
even
more
penetrating
than
roeser
rays
to
have
such
a
range
and
roeser
rays
go
right
through
a
planet
without
even
slowing
up
they
of
the
same
order
as
roeser
that
is
they
waves
of
the
fourth
order
but
they
very
much
shorter
and
hence
more
penetrating
in
fact
they
the
shortest
waves
yet
known
so
short
that
roeser
never
even
suspected
their
existence
suppose
there
a
jovian
out
there
somewhere
that
intercepts
our
beams
could
they
locate
us
from
it
maybe
and
maybe
not
we
just
have
to
take
a
chance
on
that
that
goes
right
back
to
what
we
were
talking
about
this
morning
they
might
be
anywhere
so
the
chance
of
hitting
one
is
very
small
it
is
like
hitting
the
because
we
knew
within
pretty
narrow
limits
where
to
look
for
her
and
even
at
that
we
had
to
hunt
for
her
for
half
a
day
before
we
hit
her
we
probably
safe
but
even
if
they
should
have
located
us
we
probably
be
able
to
hide
somewhere
until
the
gets
here
well
the
quicker
i
get
busy
sending
the
dope
the
sooner
they
can
get
started
tell
them
to
be
sure
and
bring
me
all
my
clothes
they
can
find
a
gallon
of
perfume
a
barrel
of
powder
and
a
carload
of
fantasie
chocolates
i
been
a
savage
so
long
that
i
want
to
wallow
in
luxury
for
a
while
i
do
that
and
i
want
some
real
cigarettes
stevens
first
sent
a
terse
but
complete
account
of
everything
that
had
happened
to
the
and
a
brief
summary
of
what
he
and
nadia
had
done
since
the
cutting
up
of
the
ipv
the
narrative
finished
he
launched
into
a
prolonged
and
detailed
scientific
discussion
of
the
enemy
and
their
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
he
dwelt
precisely
and
at
length
upon
the
functioning
of
everything
he
had
seen
though
during
the
long
months
of
their
isolation
he
had
been
too
busy
to
do
any
actual
work
upon
the
weapons
of
the
supposed
jovians
yet
his
keen
mind
had
evolved
many
mathematical
and
physical
deductions
hypotheses
and
theories
and
these
he
sent
out
to
the
concluding
there
all
the
dope
i
can
give
you
figure
it
out
and
do
come
at
all
until
you
can
come
loaded
for
bear
they
bad
medicine
call
us
occasionally
to
keep
us
informed
as
to
when
to
expect
you
but
call
too
often
we
do
want
them
locating
you
and
if
they
should
locate
us
through
your
ray
or
ours
it
would
be
just
too
bad
stevens
and
newton
nadia
had
insisted
upon
staying
up
and
had
been
brewing
pot
after
pot
of
her
substitutes
for
coffee
while
he
sat
at
the
key
and
it
was
almost
daylight
when
he
finally
shut
off
the
power
and
arose
his
right
arm
practically
paralyzed
from
the
unaccustomed
strain
of
hours
of
telegraphing
well
sweetheart
that
that
he
exclaimed
in
relief
brandon
and
westfall
are
on
the
job
nothing
to
do
now
but
wait
and
study
up
on
our
own
account
on
those
jovians
rays
this
has
been
one
long
day
for
us
though
little

suggest
that
we
sleep

about

week
chapter
viii
callisto
to
the
rescue
all
humanity
of
callisto
the
fourth
major
satellite
of
jupiter
had
for
many
years
been
waging
a
desperate
and
apparently
hopeless
defense
against
invading
hordes
of
beings
every
city
and
town
had
long
since
been
reduced
to
level
fields
of
lava
by
the
rays
of
the
invaders
every
building
and
every
trace
of
human
civilization
had
long
since
disappeared
from
the
surface
of
the
satellite
far
below
the
surface
lay
the
city
of
zbardk
the
largest
of
the
few
remaining
strongholds
of
the
human
race
at
one
portal
of
the
city
a
rocket
plane
rested
in
the
carriage
of
a
catapult
near
it
the
captain
addressed
briefly
the
six
men
normally
composing
his
crew
men
you
already
know
that
our
cruise
today
is
not
an
ordinary
patrol
we
are
to
go
to
one
there
to
destroy
a
base
of
the
hexans
we
have
perhaps
one
chance
in
ten
thousand
of
returning
therefore
i
am
taking
only
one
man
barely
enough
to
operate
the
plane
volunteers
step
one
pace
forward
the
six
stepped
forward
as
one
man
and
a
smile
came
over
the
worn
face
of
their
leader
as
he
watched
them
draw
lots
for
the
privilege
of
accompanying
him
to
probable
death
the
two
men
entered
the
body
of
the
torpedo
sealed
the
openings
and
waited
free
exits
snapped
the
captain
of
the
portal
and
twelve
observers
studied
minutely
screens
and
instrument
panels
connected
to
the
powerful
automatic
lookout
stations
beneath
the
rims
of
the
widely
separated
volcanic
craters
from
which
their
craft
could
issue
into
callisto
somber
night
no
hexan
radiation
can
be
detected
from
exit
eight
came
the
report
the
captain
of
the
portal
raised
an
arm
in
warning
threw
in
the
guides
and
the
two
passengers
were
hurled
violently
backward
deep
into
their
cushioned
seats
as
the
catapult
shot
their
plane
down
the
runway
as
the
catapult
force
was
spent
automatic
trips
upon
the
undercarriage
actuated
the
propelling
rockets
and
mile
after
mile
with
rapidly
mounting
velocity
the
plane
sped
through
the
tube
as
the
exit
was
approached
the
tunnel
described
a
long
vertical
curve
so
that
when
the
opening
into
the
shaft
of
the
crater
was
reached
and
the
undercarriage
was
automatically
detached
the
vessel
was
projected
almost
vertically
upward
such
was
its
velocity
and
so
powerful
was
the
liquid
propellant
of
its
rocket
motors
that
the
eye
could
not
follow
the
flight
of
the
warship
as
it
tore
through
the
thin
layer
of
the
atmosphere
and
hurled
itself
out
into
the
depths
of
space
did
we
get
away
asked
the
captain
hands
upon
his
controls
and
eyes
upon
his
moving
chart
of
space
i
believe
so
sir
answered
the
other
officer
at
the
screens
of
the
six
periscopic
devices
which
covered
the
full
sphere
of
vision
no
reports
from
the
rim
and
all
screens
blank
once
more
a
vessel
had
issued
from
the
jealously
secret
city
of
zbardk
without
betraying
its
existence
to
the
hated
and
feared
hexans
for
a
time
the
terrific
rocket
motors
continued
the
deafening
roar
of
their
continuous
explosions
then
the
desired
velocity
having
been
attained
they
were
cut
out
and
for
hours
the
good
ship
bzark
hurtled
on
through
the
void
at
an
enormous
but
constant
speed
toward
the
distant
world
of
one
which
it
was
destined
never
to
reach
captain
czuv
hexan
radiation
coordinates
twenty
two
fourteen
area
six
cried
the
observer
and
the
commander
swung
his
own
telescopic
finder
into
the
indicated
region
his
hands
played
over
course
and
distance
plotters
for
a
brief
minute
and
he
stared
at
his
results
in
astonishment
i
never
heard
of
a
hexan
traveling
that
way
before
he
frowned
constant
negative
acceleration
and
in
a
straight
line
he
must
think
that
we
have
been
cleared
out
of
the
ether
almost
parallel
to
us
and
not
much
faster
even
at
this
long
range
it
is
an
easy
kill
unless
he
starts
dodging
as
usual
as
he
spoke
he
snapped
a
switch
and
from
a
port
under
the
starboard
wing
there
shot
out
into
space
a
small
package
of
concentrated
destruction
a
torpedo
the
rockets
of
the
tiny
missile
were
flaming
but
that
flame
was
visible
only
from
the
rear
and
no
radio
beam
was
upon
it
czuv
had
given
it
precisely
the
direction
and
acceleration
necessary
to
make
it
meet
the
hexan
sphere
in
central
impact
provided
that
sphere
maintained
its
course
and
acceleration
unchanged
shall
i
direct
the
torpedo
in
the
case
the
hexan
shifts
asked
the
officer
i
think
not
they
can
of
course
detect
any
wave
at
almost
any
distance
and
at
the
first
sign
of
radioactivity
they
would
locate
and
destroy
the
bomb
they
also
in
all
probability
would
destroy
us
i
would
not
hesitate
to
attack
them
on
that
account
alone
but
we
must
remember
that
we
are
upon
a
more
important
mission
than
attacking
one
hexan
ship
we
are
far
out
of
range
of
their
electromagnetic
detectors
and
our
torpedo
will
have
such
a
velocity
that
they
will
have
no
time
to
protect
themselves
against
it
after
detection
unless
they
shift
in
the
next
few
seconds
they
are
lost
this
is
the
most
perfect
shot
i
ever
had
at
one
of
them
but
one
shot
is
all
i
dare
risk
we
must
not
betray
ourselves
course
lookout
and
rank
forgotten
the
little
crew
of
two
stared
into
the
narrow
field
of
vision
set
at
its
maximum
magnification
the
instruments
showed
that
the
enemy
vessel
was
staying
upon
its
original
course
very
soon
the
torpedo
came
within
range
of
the
detectors
of
the
hexans
but
as
captain
czuv
had
foretold
the
detection
was
a
fraction
of
a
second
too
late
rapidly
as
their
screens
responded
and
the
two
men
of
zbardk
uttered
together
a
short
fierce
cry
of
joy
as
a
brilliant
flash
of
light
announced
the
annihilation
of
the
hexan
vessel
but
hold
the
observer
stared
into
his
screen
upon
that
same
line
but
now
at
constant
velocity
there
is
still
a
very
faint
radiation
of
a
pattern
i
have
never
seen
before
i
think
i
believe
the
captain
was
studying
the
pattern
puzzled
it
must
be
low
frequency
electricity
which
is
never
used
so
far
as
i
know
it
may
be
some
new
engine
of
destruction
which
the
hexan
was
towing
at
such
a
distance
that
the
explosion
of
our
torpedo
did
not
destroy
it
since
there
are
no
signs
of
hexan
activity
and
since
it
will
not
take
much
fuel
we
shall
investigate
that
radiation
tail
and
rockets
burst
into
roaring
activity
and
soon
the
plane
was
cautiously
approaching
the
mass
of
wreckage
which
had
been
the
ipv
human
beings
although
of
some
foreign
species
exclaimed
the
captain
as
his
swept
through
the
undamaged
upper
portion
of
the
great
liner
and
came
to
rest
upon
captain
king
at
his
desk
although
the
upper
of
the
terrestrial
vessel
had
been
cut
away
by
the
hexan
plane
of
force
jury
lights
had
been
rigged
and
the
two
commanders
were
soon
trying
to
communicate
with
each
other
intelligible
conversation
was
of
course
impossible
but
king
soon
realized
that
the
visitors
were
not
enemies
at
their
pantomimed
suggestion
he
put
on
a
and
wafted
himself
over
to
the
airlock
of
the
callistonian
warplane
inside
the
central
compartment
the
strangers
placed
over
his
helmet
a
heavily
wired
harness
and
he
found
himself
instantly
in
full
mental
communication
with
the
callistonian
commander
for
several
minutes
they
stood
silent
exchanging
thoughts
with
a
rapidity
impossible
in
any
language
then
dressed
in
both
leaped
lightly
across
the
narrow
gap
into
the
still
open
outer
lock
of
the
terrestrial
liner
king
watched
czuv
narrowly
after
the
pressure
began
to
collapse
his
suit
but
the
stranger
made
no
sign
of
distress
he
had
been
right
in
his
assurance
that
the
extra
pressure
would
scarcely
inconvenience
him
king
tore
off
his
helmet
issued
a
brief
order
and
soon
every
speaker
in
the
announced
all
passengers
and
all
members
of
the
crew
except
lookouts
on
duty
will
assemble
immediately
in
saloon
three
to
discuss
a
possible
immediate
rescue
the
subject
being
one
of
paramount
interest
it
was
a
matter
of
minutes
until
the
full
complement
of
two
hundred
men
and
women
were
in
the
main
saloon
clinging
to
hastily
rigged
hand
lines
closely
packed
before
the
raised
platform
upon
which
were
king
and
czuv
wired
together
with
the
peculiar
callistonian
harness
to
most
of
the
passengers
familiar
with
the
humanity
of
three
planets
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
brought
no
surprise
but
many
of
them
stared
in
undisguised
amazement
at
his
childish
body
his
pale
almost
colorless
skin
his
small
weak
legs
and
arms
and
his
massive
head
ladies
and
gentlemen
captain
king
opened
the
meeting
i
introduce
to
you
captain
czuv
of
the
scout
cruiser
of
the
only
human
race
now
living
upon
the
fourth
large
satellite
of
jupiter
which
satellite
we
know
as
callisto
i
am
avoiding
their
own
names
as
much
as
possible
because
they
are
almost
unpronounceable
in
english
or
interplanetarian
this
device
that
you
see
connecting
us
is
a
callistonian
thought
transformer
by
means
of
which
any
two
intelligent
beings
can
converse
without
language
our
situation
is
peculiar
and
in
order
that
you
may
understand
fully
what
lies
ahead
of
us
the
captain
will
now
speak
to
you
through
me
that
is
what
follows
will
be
spoken
by
captain
czuv
of
the
but
he
will
be
using
my
vocal
organs
friends
from
distant
tellus
king
voice
went
on
almost
without
a
break
i
greet
you
i
am
glad
for
your
sake
as
well
as
our
own
that
your
vessel
was
able
to
destroy
the
hexan
ship
holding
you
captive
and
whose
crew
would
have
killed
you
all
as
soon
as
they
had
landed
your
vessel
and
had
read
your
minds
i
regret
bitterly
that
we
can
do
so
little
for
you
for
only
the
representatives
of
a
human
civilization
being
exterminated
by
a
race
of
highly
intelligent
monsters
can
fully
realize
how
desirable
it
is
for
all
the
various
races
of
humanity
to
assist
and
support
each
other
in
order
that
you
may
understand
the
situation
it
is
necessary
that
i
delve
at
some
length
into
ancient
history
but
we
have
ample
time
in
about
he
broke
off
realizing
that
the
two
races
had
no
thought
in
common
in
the
measure
of
time
time
of
rotation
of
great
planet
upon
axis
flashed
from
czuv
brain
and
about
five
hours
king
mind
flashed
back
it
will
be
about
five
hours
before
any
steps
can
be
taken
so
that
i
feel
justified
in
using
a
brief
period
for
explanation
in
the
evolution
of
the
various
forms
of
life
upon
callisto
two
genera
developed
intelligence
far
ahead
of
all
others
one
genus
was
the
human
as
you
and
i
the
other
the
hexan
this
creature
happily
unknown
to
you
of
the
planets
nearer
our
common
sun
is
the
product
of
an
entirely
different
evolution
it
is
a
animal
with
a
brain
equal
to
our
own
one
perhaps
in
some
ways
superior
to
our
own
they
have
nothing
in
common
with
humanity
however
they
have
few
of
our
traits
and
fewer
of
our
mental
processes
even
we
who
have
fought
them
so
long
can
scarcely
comprehend
the
chambers
of
horror
that
are
their
minds
even
were
i
able
to
paint
a
sufficiently
vivid
picture
with
words
you
of
earth
could
not
begin
to
understand
their
utter
ruthlessness
and
inhumanity
even
among
themselves
you
would
believe
that
i
was
lying
or
that
my
viewpoint
was
warped
i
can
say
only
that
i
hope
most
sincerely
that
none
of
you
will
ever
get
better
acquainted
with
them
ages
ago
then
the
human
and
the
hexan
developed
upon
all
four
of
the
major
satellites
of
the
great
planet
which
you
know
as
jupiter
and
upon
the
north
polar
region
of
jupiter
itself
by
what
means
the
two
races
came
into
being
upon
worlds
so
widely
separated
in
space
we
know
not
we
only
know
it
to
be
the
fact
human
life
however
could
not
long
endure
upon
jupiter
the
various
human
races
after
many
attempts
to
meet
conditions
of
life
there
by
variations
in
type
fell
before
the
hexans
who
although
very
small
in
size
upon
the
planet
thrived
there
amazingly
upon
the
three
outer
satellites
humanity
triumphed
and
many
hundreds
of
cycles
ago
the
hexans
of
those
satellites
were
wiped
out
save
for
an
occasional
tribe
of
savages
of
low
intelligence
who
lived
in
various
undesirable
portions
of
the
three
worlds
for
ages
then
there
was
peace
upon
callisto
here
is
the
picture
at
that
time
upon
jupiter
the
hexans
upon
io
hexans
and
humans
waging
a
ceaseless
and
relentless
war
of
mutual
extermination
upon
the
three
outer
satellites
humanity
in
undisturbed
and
unthreatened
peace
five
worlds
each
ignorant
of
life
upon
any
other
as
i
have
said
the
hexans
of
jupiter
were
and
are
diabolically
intelligent
driven
probably
by
their
desire
to
see
what
lay
beyond
their
atmosphere
of
eternal
cloud
to
the
penetration
of
which
their
eyesight
was
attuned
they
developed
the
and
effected
a
safe
landing
first
upon
the
barren
airless
moonlet
nearest
them
and
then
upon
fruitful
io
there
they
made
common
cause
with
the
hexans
against
the
humans
and
in
space
of
time
ionian
humanity
ceased
to
exist
much
traffic
and
interbreeding
followed
between
the
hexans
of
jupiter
and
those
of
io
resulting
in
time
in
a
race
intermediate
in
size
between
the
parent
stocks
and
equally
at
home
in
the
widely
variant
air
pressures
and
gravities
of
planet
and
satellite
soon
their
astronomical
instruments
revealed
the
cities
of
europa
to
their
gaze
and
as
soon
as
they
discovered
that
the
civilization
of
europa
was
human
they
destroyed
it
utterly
with
the
insatiable
blood
lust
that
is
their
heritage
in
the
meantime
the
human
civilizations
of
ganymede
and
callisto
had
also
developed
instruments
of
power
observing
the
cities
upon
the
other
satellites
many
scientists
studied
intensively
the
problem
of
space
navigation
and
finally
there
was
some
commerce
between
the
two
outer
satellites
at
favorable
times
finally
vessels
were
also
sent
to
io
and
to
europa
but
none
of
them
returned
knowing
then
what
to
expect
ganymede
and
callisto
joined
forces
and
prepared
for
war
but
our
science
so
long
attuned
to
the
arts
of
peace
had
fallen
behind
lamentably
in
the
devising
of
more
and
ever
more
deadly
instruments
of
destruction
ganymede
fell
and
in
her
fall
we
read
our
own
doom
abandoning
our
cities
we
built
anew
underground
profiting
from
lessons
learned
full
bloodily
upon
ganymede
we
resolved
to
prolong
the
existence
of
the
human
race
as
long
as
possible
the
hexans
were
and
are
masters
of
the
physical
science
they
command
the
spectrum
in
a
way
undreamed
of
their
detectors
reveal
etheric
disturbances
at
unbelievable
distances
and
they
have
at
their
beck
and
call
forces
of
staggering
magnitude
therefore
in
our
cities
is
no
electricity
save
that
which
is
wired
shielded
and
grounded
no
broadcast
radio
no
source
whatever
of
etheric
disturbances
save
light
and
our
walls
are
fields
of
force
which
we
believe
to
be
impenetrable
to
any
searching
frequency
capable
of
being
generated
now
i
am
able
to
picture
to
you
the
present
we
are
the
last
representatives
of
the
human
race
in
the
jovian
planetary
system
our
every
trace
upon
the
surface
has
been
obliterated
we
are
hiding
in
our
holes
in
the
ground
coming
out
at
night
by
stealth
so
that
our
burrows
shall
not
be
revealed
to
the
hexans
we
are
fighting
for
time
in
which
our
scientists
may
learn
the
secrets
of
power
and
fearing
each
new
day
that
the
enemy
may
have
so
perfected
their
systems
of
rays
that
they
will
be
able
to
detect
us
and
destroy
us
even
in
our
underground
and
heavily
shielded
retreats
by
means
of
forces
even
more
incomprehensible
than
those
they
are
now
employing
therefore
friends
you
see
how
little
we
are
able
to
do
for
you
we
a
race
fighting
for
our
very
existence
and
doomed
to
extinction
save
for
a
miracle
we
can
not
take
you
to
callisto
for
it
is
besieged
by
the
hexans
and
the
driving
forces
of
your
lifeboats
practically
broadcast
as
they
are
would
be
detected
and
we
should
all
be
destroyed
long
before
we
could
reach
safety
captain
king
and
i
have
pondered
long
and
have
been
able
to
see
only
one
course
of
action
we
are
drifting
at
constant
velocity
using
no
power
and
with
all
save
the
most
vitally
necessary
machinery
at
rest
thus
only
may
we
hope
to
avoid
detection
during
the
next
two
hours
our
present
course
will
take
us
very
close
to
europa
which
the
hexans
believe
to
be
like
ganymede
entirely
devoid
of
civilized
life
its
original
humanity
was
totally
destroyed
and
all
its
civilized
hexans
are
finding
shelter
from
our
torpedoes
upon
jupiter
until
we
of
callisto
shall
likewise
have
been
annihilated
the
temperature
of
europa
will
suit
you
its
atmosphere
while
less
dense
than
that
to
which
you
are
accustomed
will
adequately
support
your
life
if
we
are
not
detected
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
hours
we
can
probably
land
upon
europa
in
safety
since
its
neighborhood
is
guarded
but
loosely
in
fact
we
have
a
city
there
as
yet
unsuspected
by
the
hexans
in
which
our
scientists
will
continue
to
labor
after
callisto
civilization
shall
have
disappeared
we
think
that
it
will
be
safe
to
use
your
power
for
the
short
time
necessary
to
effect
a
landing
we
shall
land
in
a
cavern
in
a
crater
already
in
communication
with
our
city
in
that
cavern
instructed
and
aided
by
some
of
us
you
will
build
a
rocket
vessel
no
rays
can
be
used
because
of
the
hexans
in
which
you
will
be
able
to
travel
to
a
region
close
enough
to
your
earth
so
that
you
can
call
for
help
you
will
not
be
able
to
carry
enough
fuel
to
land
there
in
fact
nearly
all
the
journey
will
have
to
be
made
without
power
traveling
freely
in
a
highly
elongated
orbit
around
the
sun
but
if
you
escape
the
hexans
you
should
be
able
to
reach
home
safely
in
time
it
is
for
the
consideration
of
this
plan
that
this
meeting
has
been
called
just
one
question
breckenridge
spoke
the
hexans
are
intelligent
why
are
they
leaving
europa
and
ganymede
so
unguarded
that
human
beings
can
move
back
there
and
that
we
can
land
there
all
undetected
i
will
answer
that
question
myself
replied
king
captain
czuv
did
not
quite
do
justice
to
his
own
people
it
is
true
that
they
are
being
conquered
but
for
every
human
life
that
is
taken
a
thousand
hexans
die
and
for
every
human
ship
that
is
lost
twenty
hexan
vessels
are
annihilated
in
return
while
the
hexans
are
masters
of
rays
the
humans
are
equally
masters
of
explosives
and
of
mechanisms
they
can
hit
a
perfect
score
upon
any
target
in
free
space
whose
course
and
acceleration
can
be
determined
at
any
range
up
to
five
thousand
kilometers
and
they
have
explosives
thousands
of
times
as
powerful
as
any
known
to
us
ray
screens
are
effective
only
against
rays
and
the
hexans
can
not
destroy
anything
they
can
not
see
before
it
strikes
them
so
it
is
that
all
the
hexan
vessels
except
those
necessary
to
protect
their
own
strongholds
are
being
concentrated
against
callisto
they
can
not
spare
vessels
to
guard
uselessly
the
abandoned
satellites
because
of
the
enormously
high
gravity
of
jupiter
the
hexans
there
are
safe
from
human
attack
save
for
ineffectual
bombardment
but
io
is
being
attacked
constantly
and
it
is
probable
that
in
a
few
more
years
io
also
will
be
an
abandoned
world
some
of
you
may
have
received
the
impressions
that
the
hexans
are
to
triumph
immediately
but
such
an
idea
is
wrong
the
humans
can
and
will
hold
out
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
unless
the
enemy
perfects
a
destructive
ray
of
the
type
referred
to
even
then
i
think
that
our
human
cousins
will
hold
out
a
long
time
they
are
able
men
fighters
all
and
their
underground
cities
are
beautifully
protected
there
was
little
argument
most
of
the
auditors
could
understand
that
the
suggested
course
was
the
best
one
possible
the
remainder
were
so
stunned
by
the
unbelievable
events
of
the
attack
that
they
had
no
initiative
but
were
willing
to
follow
wherever
the
more
valiant
spirits
led
it
was
decided
that
no
attempt
should
be
made
to
salvage
any
portion
of
the
since
any
such
attempt
would
be
fraught
with
danger
and
since
the
wreckage
would
be
of
little
value
the
new
vessel
was
to
be
rocket
driven
and
was
to
be
built
of
callistonian
alloys
personal
belongings
were
moved
into
lifeboats
doors
were
closed
and
there
ensued
a
painful
period
of
waiting
and
suspense
the
stated
hour
was
reached
without
event
no
hexan
scout
had
come
close
enough
to
them
to
detect
the
radiation
of
the
vital
machinery
of
the
cut
as
it
was
to
the
irreducible
minimum
and
quite
effectively
grounded
as
it
was
by
the
enormous
mass
of
her
shielding
armor
at
a
signal
from
captain
czuv
the
pilot
of
each
lifeboat
shot
his
tiny
craft
out
into
space
and
took
his
allotted
place
in
the
formation
following
closely
behind
the
flying
toward
europa
now
so
large
in
the
field
of
vision
that
she
resembled
more
a
world
than
a
moon
captain
king
in
the
callistonian
vessel
transmitted
to
breckenridge
the
route
and
flight
data
given
him
by
the
navigator
of
the
winged
craft
the
chief
pilot
flying
point
in
turn
relayed
more
detailed
instructions
to
the
less
experienced
pilots
of
the
other
lifeboats
soon
the
surface
of
europa
lay
beneath
them
a
rugged
cratered
and
torn
topography
of
mighty
ranges
of
volcanic
mountains
most
of
the
craters
were
cold
and
lifeless
but
here
and
there
a
plume
of
smoke
and
steam
betrayed
the
presence
of
vast
quiescent
forces
straight
down
one
of
those
gigantic
lifeless
shafts
the
fleet
of
space
craft
dropped
straight
down
a
full
two
miles
before
the
landing
signal
was
given
at
the
bottom
of
the
shaft
a
section
of
the
rocky
wall
swung
aside
revealing
the
yawning
black
mouth
of
a
horizontal
tunnel
at
intervals
upon
its
roof
there
winked
into
being
almost
invisible
points
of
light
along
that
line
of
lights
the
lifeboats
felt
their
way
coming
finally
into
a
huge
cavern
against
one
sheer
metal
wall
of
which
they
parked
in
an
orderly
row
roll
was
called
and
the
terrestrials
walked
as
well
as
they
could
in
the
feeble
gravity
of
the
satellite
across
the
vast
chamber
and
into
a
conveyance
somewhat
resembling
a
railway
coach
which
darted
away
as
soon
as
the
doors
were
shut
for
hundreds
of
miles
that
strange
tunnel
extended
and
as
the
car
shot
along
door
after
door
of
natural
rock
opened
before
it
and
closed
as
soon
as
it
had
sped
through
in
spite
of
the
high
velocity
of
the
vehicle
it
required
almost
two
hours
to
complete
the
journey
finally
however
it
slowed
to
a
halt
and
the
terrestrial
visitors
disembarked
at
a
portal
of
the
europan
city
of
the
callistonians
attention
barked
captain
king
the
name
of
this
city
as
nearly
as
i
can
come
to
it
in
english
is
comes
fairly
close
to
it
and
is
easier
to
pronounce
we
must
finish
our
trip
in
small
cars
holding
ten
persons
each
we
shall
assemble
again
in
the
building
in
which
we
have
been
assigned
quarters
the
driver
of
each
car
will
lead
his
passengers
to
the
council
room
in
which
we
shall
meet
oh
what
the
use
this
is
horrible
horrible
we
might
as
well
die
a
nervous
woman
shrieked
and
fainted
such
a
feeling
is
perhaps
natural
king
went
on
after
the
woman
had
been
revived
and
quiet
had
been
restored
but
please
control
it
as
much
as
possible
we
are
alive
and
well
and
will
be
able
to
return
to
tellus
eventually
please
remember
that
these
people
are
putting
themselves
to
much
trouble
and
inconvenience
to
help
us
desperate
as
their
own
situation
is
and
conduct
yourselves
accordingly
the
rebuke
had
its
effect
and
with
no
further
protest
the
company
boarded
the
small
cars
which
shot
through
an
opening
in
the
wall
and
into
a
street
of
that
strange
subterranean
city
breckenridge
in
the
last
car
to
leave
the
portal
studied
his
surroundings
with
interest
as
his
conveyance
darted
through
the
gateway
more
or
less
a
fatalist
by
nature
and
an
adventurer
of
course
since
no
other
type
existed
among
the
older
spacehounds
of
the
ipc
he
was
intensely
interested
in
every
new
phase
of
their
experience
and
was
no
whit
dismayed
or
frightened
he
found
himself
seated
in
a
narrow
canoe
of
metal
immediately
behind
the
pilot
who
sat
at
a
small
control
panel
in
the
bow
propelled
by
electromagnetic
fields
above
a
single
rail
upon
lightly
touching
and
noiseless
wheels
the
terrestrial
pilot
saw
with
keen
appreciation
the
manner
in
which
switch
after
switch
ahead
of
them
obeyed
the
impulses
sent
ahead
from
the
speeding
car
the
streets
were
narrow
and
filled
with
monorails
pedestrians
pursued
their
courses
upon
walks
attached
to
the
walls
of
the
buildings
far
above
the
level
of
the
streets
the
walls
were
themselves
peculiar
rising
as
they
did
stark
unbroken
windowless
expanses
of
metal
merging
into
and
supporting
a
massive
roof
of
the
same
silvery
metal
walls
and
roof
alike
reflected
a
soft
yet
intense
white
light
soon
a
sliding
switch
ahead
of
them
shot
in
and
simultaneously
an
opening
appeared
in
the
blank
metal
wall
of
a
building
through
the
opening
the
flew
and
as
the
pilot
slowed
the
canoe
to
a
halt
the
door
slid
smoothly
shut
behind
them
parking
the
car
beside
a
row
of
its
fellows
the
callistonian
driver
indicated
that
the
terrestrials
were
to
follow
him
and
led
the
way
into
a
large
hall
there
the
others
from
the
were
assembled
facing
captain
king
who
was
standing
upon
a
table
fellow
travelers
king
addressed
them
our
course
of
action
has
been
decided
there
are
two
hundred
three
of
us
there
will
be
twenty
sections
of
ten
persons
each
section
being
in
charge
of
one
of
the
officers
of
the
doctor
penfield
our
surgeon
a
man
whose
intelligence
fairness
and
integrity
are
unquestioned
will
be
in
supreme
command
his
power
and
authority
will
be
absolute
limited
only
by
the
callistonian
council
he
will
work
in
harmony
with
the
engineer
who
is
to
direct
the
entire
project
of
building
the
new
vessel
each
of
you
will
be
expected
to
do
whatever
he
can
the
work
you
will
be
asked
to
do
will
be
well
within
your
powers
and
you
will
each
have
ample
leisure
for
recreation
study
and
amusement
of
all
of
which
you
will
find
unsuspected
stores
in
this
underground
community
you
will
each
be
registered
and
studied
by
physicians
surgeons
and
psychologists
and
each
of
you
will
have
prescribed
for
him
the
exact
diet
that
is
necessary
for
his
best
development
you
will
find
this
diet
somewhat
monotonous
compared
to
our
normal
fare
of
natural
products
since
it
is
wholly
synthetic
but
that
is
one
of
the
minor
drawbacks
that
must
be
endured
chief
pilot
breckenridge
and
i
will
not
be
with
you
in
some
small
and
partial
recompense
for
what
they
are
doing
for
us
all
he
and
i
are
going
with
captain
czuv
to
callisto
there
to
see
whether
or
not
we
can
aid
them
in
any
way
in
the
fight
against
the
hexans
one
last
word
doctor
penfield
rulings
will
be
the
products
of
his
own
mind
after
consultation
and
agreement
with
the
council
of
this
city
and
will
be
for
the
best
good
of
all
i
do
not
anticipate
any
refusal
to
cooperate
with
him
if
however
such
refusal
should
occur
please
remember
that
he
is
a
despot
with
absolute
power
and
that
anyone
obstructing
the
program
by
refusing
to
follow
his
suggestions
will
spend
the
rest
of
his
time
here
in
confinement
and
will
go
back
to
tellus
in
irons
if
at
all
in
case
chief
pilot
breckenridge
and
i
should
not
see
you
again
we
bid
you
goodbye
and
wish
you
a
safe
voyage
but
we
expect
to
go
back
with
you
brief
farewells
were
said
and
captain
and
pilot
accompanied
czuv
to
one
of
the
little
out
of
the
building
it
dashed
and
down
the
crowded
but
noiseless
thoroughfare
to
the
portal
signal
lights
flashed
briefly
there
and
they
did
not
stop
but
tore
on
through
the
portal
and
the
tunnel
with
increasing
speed
do
have
to
transfer
to
a
big
car
then
asked
breckenridge
no
king
made
answer
small
cars
can
travel
these
tubes
as
well
as
the
large
ones
and
on
much
less
power
in
the
city
the
wheels
touch
the
rails
lightly
not
for
support
but
to
make
contacts
through
which
traffic
signals
are
sent
and
received
in
the
tunnels
the
wheels
do
not
touch
at
all
as
signaling
is
unnecessary
the
tunnels
being
used
infrequently
and
by
but
one
vehicle
at
a
time
no
trolleys
tracks
or
wires
are
visible
you
notice
everything
is
hidden
from
any
possible
visiray
of
the
hexans
how
about
their
power
i
do
understand
it
very
well
hardly
at
all
in
fact
it
is
quite
simple
to
the
surprise
of
both
terrestrials
czuv
was
speaking
english
but
with
a
strong
and
very
peculiar
accent
slighting
all
the
vowels
and
accenting
heavily
the
consonant
sounds
the
car
no
longer
requires
my
attention
so
i
am
now
free
to
converse
you
are
surprised
at
my
knowing
your
language
you
will
speak
mine
after
a
few
more
applications
of
the
thought
exchanger
i
am
speaking
with
a
vile
accent
of
course
but
that
is
merely
because
my
vocal
organs
are
not
accustomed
to
making
vowel
sounds
our
power
is
obtained
by
the
combustion
of
gases
in
highly
efficient
turbines
it
is
transmitted
and
used
as
direct
current
our
generator
and
motors
being
so
constructed
that
they
can
produce
no
etheric
disturbances
capable
of
penetrating
the
shielding
walls
of
our
city
the
city
was
built
close
to
deposits
of
coal
oil
and
gas
of
sufficient
amount
to
support
our
life
for
thousands
of
years
for
from
these
deposits
come
power
food
clothing
and
all
the
other
necessities
and
luxuries
of
our
lives
strong
fans
draw
air
from
various
extinct
craters
force
it
through
ventilating
ducts
into
every
room
and
recess
of
the
city
and
exhaust
it
into
the
shaft
of
a
quiescent
volcano
in
whose
gaseous
outflow
any
trace
of
our
activities
is
of
course
imperceptible
for
obvious
reasons
no
rockets
or
combustion
motors
are
used
in
the
city
proper
thus
captain
czuv
explained
to
the
terrestrials
his
own
mode
of
life
and
received
from
them
in
turn
full
information
concerning
earthly
life
activity
and
science
long
they
talked
and
it
was
almost
time
to
slow
down
for
the
journey
end
when
the
callistonian
brought
the
conversation
back
to
their
immediate
concerns
my
lieutenant
and
i
were
upon
a
mission
of
some
importance
but
it
is
more
important
to
take
you
to
callisto
for
there
may
be
many
things
in
which
you
can
help
us
not
in
rays
we
know
all
the
vibrations
you
have
mentioned
and
several
others
the
enemy
however
is
supreme
in
that
field
and
until
our
scientists
have
succeeded
in
developing
such
as
are
used
by
the
hexans
it
would
be
suicidal
to
use
rays
at
all
such
screens
necessitate
the
projection
of
pure
yet
dirigible
forces
you
do
not
have
them
upon
your
planet
no
and
so
far
as
i
know
such
screens
are
also
unknown
upon
mars
and
venus
with
whose
inhabitants
we
are
friendly
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
planets
should
be
friendly
the
solar
system
should
be
linked
together
in
intercourse
for
common
advancement
but
that
is
not
to
be
the
hexans
will
eventually
triumph
here
and
a
jovian
system
peopled
by
hexans
will
have
no
intercourse
with
any
human
civilization
save
that
of
internecine
war
we
of
callisto
have
only
one
hope
or
is
it
really
a
hope
in
the
south
polar
country
of
jupiter
there
dwells
a
race
of
beings
implacably
hostile
to
the
hexans
they
seem
to
invade
the
country
of
the
hexans
frequently
even
though
they
are
apparently
repulsed
each
time
our
emissaries
to
the
south
polar
country
however
have
never
returned
those
beings
whatever
they
are
if
not
actively
inimical
certainly
are
not
friendly
toward
us
you
know
nothing
of
their
nature
nothing
since
our
electrical
instruments
are
not
sufficiently
sensitive
to
give
us
more
than
a
general
idea
of
what
is
transpiring
there
and
vision
is
practically
useless
in
that
eternal
fog
we
know
however
that
they
are
far
advanced
in
science
and
we
are
thankful
indeed
that
none
of
their
frightful
flying
fortresses
have
been
launched
against
us
they
apparently
are
not
interested
in
the
satellites
and
it
is
no
doubt
due
to
their
unintentional
assistance
that
we
have
survived
as
long
as
we
have
in
the
cavern
at
last
the
three
men
boarded
the
callistonian
and
were
shot
up
the
crater
shaft
the
voyage
to
callisto
was
uneventful
even
uninteresting
save
at
its
termination
the
coated
every
inch
as
it
was
with
a
dull
dead
black
completely
absorptive
outer
coating
entered
the
thin
layer
of
callisto
atmosphere
in
darkest
night
with
all
rockets
dead
with
not
a
light
showing
and
with
no
apparatus
of
any
kind
functioning
utterly
invisible
and
undetectable
she
dove
downward
and
not
until
she
was
well
below
the
crater
rim
did
the
forward
rockets
burst
into
furious
life
then
the
terrestrials
understood
another
reason
for
the
immense
depth
of
those
shafts
other
than
that
of
protection
from
the
detectors
of
the
enemy
all
that
distance
was
necessary
to
overcome
the
velocity
of
their
free
fall
without
employing
a
negative
acceleration
greater
than
the
frail
callistonian
bodies
could
endure
from
the
cavern
at
the
foot
of
the
shaft
a
regulation
tunnel
extended
to
the
callistonian
city
of
zbardk
portal
and
city
were
very
like
wruszk
upon
distant
europa
and
soon
the
terrestrial
captain
and
pilot
were
in
conference
with
the
council
of
callisto
months
of
earthly
time
dragged
slowly
past
months
during
which
king
and
breckenridge
studied
intensively
the
offensive
and
defensive
systems
of
callisto
without
finding
any
particular
in
which
they
could
improve
them
to
any
considerable
degree
captain
czuv
and
his
warplane
still
survived
and
it
was
while
the
callistonian
commander
was
visiting
his
terrestrial
guests
that
king
voiced
the
discontent
that
had
long
affected
both
men
we
both
tired
of
doing
nothing
czuv
we
have
been
of
little
real
benefit
and
we
have
decided
that
your
ideas
of
us
are
all
wrong
we
are
convinced
that
our
personal
horsepower
can
be
of
vastly
more
use
to
you
than
our
which
does
amount
to
much
your
whole
present
policy
is
one
of
hiding
and
sniping
i
think
that
i
know
why
but
i
want
to
be
sure
your
vessels
carry
lots
of
fuel
why
can
the
hexans
outrun
you
thus
did
king
put
his
problem
they
can
stand
enormously
higher
accelerations
than
we
can
the
very
strongest
of
us
loses
consciousness
at
an
acceleration
of
meters
per
second
per
second
no
matter
how
he
is
braced
and
that
is
only
a
little
greater
than
the
normal
gravity
of
our
enemies
upon
jupiter
their
vessels
at
highest
power
develop
an
acceleration
of
meters
and
the
hexans
themselves
can
stand
much
more
than
even
that
high
figure
replied
czuv
i
thought
so
assume
that
you
traveled
at
would
it
disable
you
permanently
or
would
you
recover
as
soon
as
it
was
lowered
we
would
recover
promptly
unless
the
exposure
had
been
unduly
prolonged
why
because
said
king
i
can
stand
an
acceleration
of
meters
for
two
hours
and
breckenridge
here
tests
fifty
two
meters
i
can
navigate
anything
and
breckenridge
can
observe
as
well
as
any
of
your
own
men
build
a
plane
to
accelerate
at
meters
and
we
will
blow
those
hexans
out
of
the
ether
you
will
have
to
revive
and
do
the
shooting
however
your
gunnery
is
entirely
beyond
us
that
is
an
idea
of
promise
and
one
that
had
not
occurred
to
any
of
us
czuv
replied
and
work
was
begun
at
once
upon
the
new
flyer
when
the
was
ready
for
its
maiden
voyage
its
crew
of
three
studied
it
as
it
lay
in
the
catapult
at
the
portal
dead
black
as
were
all
the
warplanes
its
body
was
twice
as
large
as
that
of
the
ordinary
vessel
its
wings
were
even
more
stubby
and
its
accommodations
had
been
cut
to
a
minimum
to
make
room
for
the
enormous
stores
of
fuel
necessary
to
drive
the
greatly
increased
battery
of
rocket
motors
and
for
the
extra
supply
of
torpedoes
carried
waving
to
the
group
of
soldiers
and
citizens
gathered
to
witness
the
of
the
new
dreadnought
of
space
the
three
men
entered
the
cramped
operating
compartment
strapped
themselves
into
their
seats
and
were
shot
away
as
usual
the
driving
rockets
were
cut
off
well
below
the
rim
of
the
shaft
and
the
vessel
rose
in
a
long
and
graceful
curve
invisible
in
the
night
such
was
its
initial
velocity
and
so
slight
was
the
force
of
gravity
of
the
satellite
that
they
were
many
hundreds
of
miles
from
the
exit
before
they
began
to
descend
and
breckenridge
studied
his
screens
narrowly
for
signs
of
hexan
activity
do
you
want
to
try
one
of
your
shots
when
we
find
one
of
them
the
pilot
asked
czuv
no
it
would
be
useless
between
deflection
by
and
the
dodging
of
the
enemy
vessels
our
effective
range
is
shortened
to
a
few
kilometers
and
their
beams
are
deadly
at
that
distance
no
our
best
course
is
to
follow
the
original
plan
to
lure
them
out
into
space
at
uniform
acceleration
where
we
can
destroy
them
easily
right
and
breckenridge
turned
to
king
who
was
frowning
at
his
controls
how
does
she
work
on
a
dead
stick
chief
maneuverability
about
minus
ten
at
this
speed
and
in
this
air
she
have
to
have
at
least
fifteen
hundred
kilometers
an
hour
to
be
responsive
out
here
see
anything
yet
not
yet
wait
a
minute
yes
there
one
now
on
area
five
give
us
all
the
and
you
can
without
using
power
we
want
to
edge
over
close
enough
so
that
she
ca
help
but
see
us
when
we
start
the
rockets
be
sure
and
stay
well
out
of
range
i
giving
her
all
she
take
but
she
wo
take
much
with
these
wings
she
has
the
gliding
angle
of
a
kitchen
sink
all
x
i
watching
the
range
close
wish
we
had
instruments
like
these
on
the
ipv
we
have
to
install
some
when
we
get
back
all
x
give
her
the
gun
level
and
dead
ahead
half
the
battery
of
rockets
burst
into
their
stuttering
explosive
roar
of
power
and
the

darted
away
in
headlong
flight

sees
us
and
is
after
us
turn
her
straight
up
a
searing
coruscating
finger
of
flame
leaped
toward
them
but
their
calculations
had
been
sound
the
hexan
was
harmless
at
that
extreme
range
king
under
the
pilot
direction
kept
the
plane
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
sphere
while
the
satellite
grew
smaller
and
smaller
behind
them
and
czuv
lapsed
quietly
into
unconsciousness
he
been
out
for
quite
a
while
far
enough
asked
king
all
x
now
i
guess
do
believe
they
can
see
the
flash
from
here
cut
the
rockets
died
abruptly
and
a
blast
from
the
side
ports
threw
the
plane
out
of
the
beam
and
once
out
of
it
beyond
range
of
the
electromagnetic
detectors
as
they
were
their
coating
of
absolute
black
rendered
the
craft
safe
from
observation
one
dirigible
rocket
remained
in
action
its
exhaust
hidden
from
the
enemy
by
the
body
of
the
vessel
and
captain
czuv
soon
recovered
his
senses
wonderful
gentlemen
he
exclaimed
as
he
manipulated
the
delicate
controls
of
his
gunnery
panel
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
that
a
callistonian
vessel
has
escaped
from
a
hexan
by
speed
alone
an
instantaneously
extinguished
flare
of
incandescence
marked
the
passing
of
the
hexan
sphere
into
nothingness
and
the
cruiser
shot
back
toward
callisto
in
search
of
more
prey
it
was
all
too
plentiful
and
twenty
times
the
drama
was
reenacted
before
approaching
day
made
it
necessary
for
czuv
to
take
the
controls
and
dive
the
vessel
into
the
westermost
of
zbardk
a
rousing
and
enthusiastic
welcome
awaited
them
and
joy
spread
rapidly
when
their
success
became
known
now
we
know
what
to
do
and
we
had
better
do
it
immediately
before
they
get
our
system
figured
out
and
increase
their
own
power
king
reported
to
the
council
you
might
send
a
couple
of
ships
to
europa
and
bring
back
as
many
of
the
tellurian
officers
as
want
to
come
and
can
be
spared
from
the
work
there
they
all
test
above
meters
and
they
can
learn
this
stuff
in
short
order
while
they
coming
your
engineers
can
be
building
more
ships
like
this
one
the
new
vessel
did
not
make
another
voyage
until
nine
sister
ships
were
ready
and
manned
each
with
two
terrestrial
officers
and
one
callistonian
gunner
all
ten
took
to
the
ether
at
once
and
the
hexan
fleet
melted
away
like
before
a
summer
sun
a
few
weeks
of
carnage
and
destruction
and
not
a
hexan
was
within
range
of
the
detectors
of
callisto
they
were
gone
this
is
the
first
time
in
years
that
callisto
air
has
been
free
of
the
hexans
czuv
said
thoughtfully
with
your
help
we
have
reduced
their
strength
to
a
fraction
of
what
it
was
but
they
have
not
given
up
they
will
return
with
a
higher
acceleration
than
even
you
terrestrials
powerful
as
you
are
can
stand
certainly
they
will
but
you
will
be
no
worse
off
than
you
were
before
you
can
return
to
your
own
highly
effective
tactics
we
are
infinitely
better
off
for
your
help
you
have
given
us
a
new
lease
on
life
he
broke
off
as
a
flaring
light
sprang
into
being
upon
the
portal
board
and
the
observer
of

made
his
report
there
was
a

confused
shouts
arose
from
the
but
the
original
superplane
was
at
the
top
of
the
and
accordingly
king
breckenridge
and
czuv
embarked
upon
an
expedition
more
hazardous
far
than
they
had
supposed
an
expedition
whose
every
feature
was
relayed
to
those
in
the
portal
by
the
automatic
lookouts
upon
the
rims
and
which
was
ended
before
a
single
supporting
callistonian
plane
could
be
launched
for
the
enemy
vessel
was
not
the
last
of
the
hexan
vessels
as
everyone
had
supposed
it
was
the
first
of
the
craft
arriving
long
before
its
appearance
was
expected
before
its
terrific
acceleration
and
savage
onslaught
the
superplane
might
as
well
have
been
stationary
and
unarmed
after
his
long
dive
downward
king
could
not
even
leave
the
atmosphere
the
hexan
was
upon
them
within
a
few
seconds
even
though
the
stupendous
battery
of
rockets
full
driven
had
roared
almost
instantly
into
desperate
action
bomb
after
bomb
breckenridge
hurled
with
full
radio
control
fighting
with
every
resource
at
his
command
but
in
vain
the
frightful
torpedoes
were
annihilated
in
and
nose
and
wings
were
sheared
neatly
from
the
warplane
by
a
sizzling
plane
of
force
side
rockets
and
torpedo
tubes
were
likewise
sliced
away
and
the
helpless
body
of
the
callistonian
cruiser
falling
like
a
plummet
was
caught
and
held
by
a
tractor
ray
captor
and
captive
settled
toward
the
ground
this
is
a
signal
honor
observed
captain
czuv
when
he
had
revived
it
has
been
many
many
cycles
since
they
have
taken
callistonians
captive
they
kill
us
at
every
opportunity
is
it
your
custom
to
destroy
yourselves
in
a
situation
such
as
this
it
is
not
while
we
live
there
is
hope
not
ours
unless
they
have
made
enormous
strides
in
psychological
mechanisms
they
can
not
tear
from
our
minds
any
secrets
we
really
wish
to
keep
that
is
useless
he
went
on
as
king
lifted
a
you
will
have
no
opportunity
whatever
to
use
it
and
he
was
right
a
searing
beam
of
energy
drove
them
out
of
the
vessel
then
electromagnetic
waves
burned
every
metallic
object
out
of
their
possession
burning
rays
herded
them
into
the
hexan
sphere
and
into
a
small
room
whose
door
clanged
shut
behind
them
ah
two
are
humans
of
a
strange
breed
a
snarling
voice
barked
from
the
wall
in
the
callistonian
language
our
deductions
were
accurate
as
usual
it
is
to
the
humans
of
planet
three
whose
bodies
are
a
trifle
less
puny
than
those
of
the
humanity
of
the
satellites
that
we
owe
our
recent
reverses
however
those
reverses
were
merely
temporary
humanity
no
matter
what
its
breed
shall
very
shortly
disappear
from
the
satellites
now
you
scum
of
the
solar
system
you
shall
be
permitted
to
witness
an
entrancing
spectacle
on
the
way
to
our
headquarters
where
all
your
knowledge
is
to
be
taken
from
you
before
you
die
lingeringly
and
horribly
there
is
a
strange
nearing
us
probably
searching
for
the
one
we
took
and
which
you
dogs
of
callisto
must
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
take
from
us
before
we
could
study
and
kill
its
human
cargo
watch
its
destruction
and
cringe
and
know
in
your
suffering
that
the
more
you
suffer
the
greater
shall
be
our
enjoyment
i
believe
that

at

upon

huge
football
of

grey
steel
czuv
was
amazed
to
see
the
faces
of
breckenridge
and
king
light
up
with
fierce
smiles
of
pleasure
and
anticipation
you
dissemble
well
remarked
the
callistonian
that
will
rob
them
of
much
pleasure
they
get
robbed
of
more
than
that
king
returned
this
is
too
good
to
keep
and
since
they
can
not
understand
english
i
tell
you
something
i
told
you
about
stevens
he
apparently
was
killed
as
we
thought
he
must
have
escaped
and
there
is
the
result
that

there
is
far
from
innocent

far
out

outside

since
the

have
scoured

within

of

without
finding

we
got

now
with
these

we
can

thousand

from

which
is
lots
more
than
we
ever
need
we
have
drawn
a
frank
from
a

in
a
month
and
we
had
to
cut
our
field
strength
down
to
a
whisper
to
keep
from
burning
out
our
accumulators
we
can
hunt
as
far
as

we
can
go

if
we
want

for

i
say
and
in

i
getting
so

of
sticking
around
doing

i
have
to
go

illustration
flying
fortresses
were
finally
wrenched
from
the
ground
and
hurled
impetuous
and
violent
as
brandon
had
always
been
never
before
had
he
gone
to
such
lengths
as
to
suggest
a
disruption
of
the
partnership
and
westfall
knowing
that
brandon
in
his
most
violent
moments
never
threatened
idly
thought
long
before
he
replied
you
will
not
go
alone
of
course
if
you
insist
upon
going
without
further
preparation
i
will
go
too
no
matter
how
foolish
i
think
such
a
course
to
be
we
have
power
it
is
true
but
in
all
other
respects
we
are
in
no
condition
to
meet
an
opponent
having
command
of
such
resources
as
must
certainly
be
possessed
by
those
who
attacked
the
our
detectors
are
inefficient
our
system
of
vision
is
crude
to
say
the
least
and
many
other
things
are
still
in
the
experimental
stage
we
have
not
the
slightest
idea
whom
or
what
we
may
encounter
it
is
all
too
probable
that
we
would
simply
be
throwing
away
uselessly
the
lives
of
more
good
men
it
is
also
foolish
from
a
general
viewpoint
for
as
you
already
know
we
and
our
assistants
happen
to
be
in
better
position
to
study
these
things
than
is
any
one
else
at
the
present
time
however
i
will
compromise
with
you
we
can
learn
much
in
a
month
if
you
will
really
try
instead
of
wasting
time
in
fuming
around
the
ship
and
indulging
in
these
idiotic
tantrums
if
you
will
buckle
down
and
really
study
the
problems
confronting
us
for
thirty
days
we
will
set
out
at
the
end
of
that
time
ready
or
not
all
i
hate
to
do
it
but
we
been
together
too
long
to
bust
it
up
now
and
brandon
turned
toward
his
bench
scarcely
had
he
reached
it
when
a
series
of
dots
and
dashes
roared
from
an
amplifier
both
men
leaped
for
the
receiver
which
had
so
unexpectedly
burst
into
sound
reaching
it
just
as
it
relapsed
into
silence
and
from
the
tape
of
the
recorder
they
read
the
brief
message
h
four
seven
ganymede
point
oh
four
seve
that
steve
yelled
brandon
nobody
else
could
build
an
direction
no
need
of
calculating
distance
or
direction
ganymede
is
the
third
major
satellite
of
jupiter
sure
of
course
quince
never
thought
of
that
dope
enough
point
oh
four
seven
as
stevens
had
told
nadia
the
message
was
completely
informing
to
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
and
soon
brandon
answer
was
flying
toward
the
distant
satellite
he
then
started
to
call
the
officers
of
the
interplanetary
corporation
but
was
restrained
by
his
conservative
friend
it
would
be
better
to
wait
a
while
norman
in
a
few
hours
we
will
know
what
to
tell
them
at
high
acceleration
the
drove
toward
the
plane
and
brandon
calculated
from
his
own
bearings
and
from
the
current
issue
of
the
ephemeris
the
time
at
which
stevens
reply
should
be
received
two
minutes
before
that
time
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
and
fifteen
seconds
after
it
he
snapped
come
on
perce
get
busy
shake
a
leg
oh
come
norman
give
him
a
few
minutes
leeway
at
least
said
westfall
with
amused
tolerance
even
if
your
calculations
are
that
accurate
which
of
course
they
are
he
added
hastily
at
a
stormy
glance
from
hot
black
eyes
since
we
received
that
message
direct
instead
of
through
one
of
our
relay
stations
stevens
probably
has
been
throwing
it
around
for
hours
or
perhaps
days
looking
for
us
and
the
shock
of
hearing
from
us
at
last
might
well
have
put
him
out
of
control
for
a
minute
or
two
the
carrier
wave
hissed
into
the
receiver
forestalling
brandon
fiery
reply
followed
closely
by
the
code
signals
they
had
been
expecting
as
soon
as
the
story
had
been
told
and
while
brandon
was
absorbed
in
the
scientific
addenda
of
stevens
westfall
thoughtfully
called
up
newton
nadia
father
nadia
is
alive
free
safe
well
and
happy
he
shot
out
without
preliminary
or
greeting
as
soon
as
the
now
lined
features
of
the
director
showed
upon
the
communicator
screen
and
the
careworn
countenance
smoothed
magically
into
the
keen
face
of
the
fighting
newton
of
old
as
westfall
recounted
rapidly
the
tale
of
the
castaways
they
apparently
have
not
suffered
in
any
way
he
concluded
all
that
stevens
wants
is
some
cigarettes
and
your
daughter
needs
while
somewhat
more
numerous
than
his
seem
to
be
only
clothes
powder
perfume
and
candy
therefore
we
need
not
worry
about
them
the
fate
of
the
others
is
still
unknown
but
there
seems
to
be
a
slight
possibility
that
some
of
them
may
yet
be
rescued
you
may
release
as
much
or
as
little
of
this
story
as
may
seem
desirable
stevens
is
still
sending
data
of
a
highly
technical
nature
we
shall
arrive
there
at
next
tuesday
in
due
time
the
message
from
ganymede
ended
and
brandon
with
many
pages
of
his
notebook
crammed
with
figures
and
equations
snapped
off
the
power
of
the
receiver
and
turned
to
his
bench
gone
was
the
storming
impetuous
rebel
his
body
was
ruled
solely
by
the
precise
and
insatiable
brain
of
the
research
scientist
he
great
that
kid
perce
when
i
see
him
i
going
to
kiss
him
on
both
cheeks
he
got
enough
dope
on
them
to
hang
them
higher
than
franklin
kite
and
we
nail
those
jaspers
to
the
cross
or
i
a
polyp
he
crazier
than
a
loon
in
most
of
his
hunches
but
he
filled
four
of
our
biggest
gaps
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
you
and
there
are
also
lifting
or
tractor
rays
two
things
been
trying
to
dope
out
and
that
you
been
giving
me
the
bronx
cheer
on
the
titanians
have
had
a
tractor
ray
for
ages
he
sent
me
complete
dope
on
it
and
the
jovians
have
got
them
both
we
have
them
in
three
days
and
it
ought
to
be
fairly
simple
to
dope
out
the
opposite
of
a
tractor
too
a
pusher
or
presser
beam
say
round
up
the
gang
will
you
while
i
licking
some
of
this
stuff
into
shape
for
you
to
tear
apart
where
are
venus
and
mars
um
m
tell
alcantro
and
fedanzo
to
come
over
here
pronto
give
a
special
if
necessary
pick
up
dol
kenor
and
pyraz
amonar
on
the
way
no
get
them
to
tellus
too
then
we
get
action
quicker
those
four
are
all
i
want
get
anybody
else
you
want
to
come
along
his
hands
playing
over
the
keys
of
an
enormous
calculating
machine
brandon
was
instantly
immersed
in
a
profound
problem
deaf
and
blind
to
everything
about
him
westfall
knowing
well
that
results
would
follow
brandon
characteristic
attack
sat
down
at
the
controls
of
the
communicator
he
first
called
mars
the
home
planet
of
alcantro
and
fedanzo
the
foremost
experts
of
three
planets
and
was
assured
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
those
rulers
of
rays
were
ready
and
anxious
to
follow
wherever
brandon
and
westfall
might
lead
thence
to
venus
where
dol
kenor
the
electrical
wizard
and
pyraz
amonar
the
master
of
mechanism
also
readily
agreed
to
accompany
the
expedition
he
then
called
the
of
the
interplanetary
police
requesting
a
detail
of
two
hundred
picked
men
for
the
hazardous
venture
these
most
important
calls
out
of
the
way
he
was
busy
for
over
an
hour
giving
instructions
so
that
everything
would
be
in
readiness
for
the
servicing
of
the
immense
the
following
tuesday
night
having
guarded
against
everything
his
cautious
and
mind
could
envisage
he
went
over
to
brandon
desk
and
sat
down
smoking
contemplatively
until
the
idea
had
been
roughed
out
in
mathematical
terms
here
the
rough
draft
of
the
ray
screen
quince
we
generate
a
blanket
frequency
impressed
upon
the
ultra
carrier
wave
that
old
stuff
of
course
here
the
novelty
in
equation
with
two
fields
of
force
set
up
from
data
to
it
will
be
possible
actually
to
project
a
pure
force
of
such
a
nature
that
it
will
react
to
the
blanketing
frequency
at
any
predetermined
distance
that
of
course
sets
up
a
barrier
against
any
frequency
of
the
blanketed
band
incidentally
an
extension
of
the
same
idea
will
enable
us
to
see
anywhere
we
want
to
look
calculate
a
retransmitting
field
one
thing
at
a
time
please
that
screen
may
be
possible
but
those
fields
will
never
generate
it
look
at
datum
in
which
your
assumptions
are
unsound
in
order
to
make
any
solution
at
all
possible
you
have
assumed
cosine
squared
theta
negligible
mathematically
it
is
of
course
vanishingly
small
compared
to
the
first
power
of
the
cosine
but
fields
of
that
type
must
be
and
your
neglect
of
the
square
is
indefensible
since
you
can
not
integrate
with
the
squared
term
in
place
your
whole
solution
fails
not
necessarily
we
go
back
to
and
put
in
sine
squared
theta
minus
one
equal
to
z
sub
four
that
gives
us
a
coversed
sine
in
and
then
we
integrate
thus
the
argument
raged
and
all
the
assistants
whose
work
was
not
too
pressing
gathered
around
unobtrusively
for
it
was
from
just
such
fierce
discussions
as
this
that
the
and
other
discoveries
had
come
into
being
yard
after
yard
of
calculator
paper
was
filled
with
equations
and
computations
weirdly
shaped
curves
were
drawn
with
arguments
at
every
point
arguments
hot
and
violent
from
brandon
from
westfall
cold
and
precise
backed
by
lightning
calculations
and
with
facts
and
diagrams
culled
from
the
many
abstruse
works
of
reference
which
by
this
time
literally
covered
the
bench
and
overflowed
upon
the
floor
it
was
in
this
work
that
the
strikingly
different
temperaments
and
abilities
of
the
two
scientists
were
revealed
brandon
never
stood
still
but
walked
around
jerkily
chewing
savagely
the
stem
of
an
ancient
and
reeking
pipe
gesticulating
vigorously
the
while
his
keen
and
agile
mind
was
finding
a
way
over
around
or
through
the
apparently
insuperable
obstacles
which
beset
their
path
by
means
of
mathematical
and
physical
improvisations
which
no
one
not
inspired
by
sheer
genius
could
have
evolved
westfall
seated
quietly
at
the
calculator
mercilessly
shredded
brandon
theories
to
ribbons
pointing
out
their
many
flaws
with
his
cold
incisive
reasoning
and
with
rapid
calculations
of
the
many
factors
involved
then
brandon
would
find
a
remedy
for
each
weakness
in
turn
and
when
westfall
could
no
longer
find
a
single
flaw
in
the
structure
they
would
toss
the
completed
problem
upon
a
table
and
attack
the
next
one
with
unabated
zeal
brandon
in
his
light
remark
that
the
two
made
one
real
scientist
had
far
understated
the
case
those
two
brains
each
so
powerful
and
each
so
perfectly
complementing
the
other
comprised
the
who
was
to
revolutionize
science
completely
in
a
few
short
years
to
such
good
purpose
did
they
labor
that
the
calculations
were
practically
finished
by
the
time
they
reached
the
earth
there
the
ship
was
serviced
with
a
celerity
that
spoke
volumes
for
the
importance
of
her
mission
even
the
the
dazzlingly
queen
of
the
fleet
waited
unattended
and
disregarded
on
minus
time
while
the
entire
force
of
the
interplanetary
corporation
concentrated
upon
the
old
hulk
of
the
brandon
was
surprised
when
he
saw
the
two
companies
of
police
but
characteristically
accepted
without
question
the
wisdom
of
any
decision
of
his
friend
and
cordially
greeted
crowninshield
only
a
year
or
so
older
than
himself
but
already
in
charge
of
a
division
bunch
crown
lot
of
different
outfits
volunteers
for
special
duty
from
the
whole
tellurian
force
yes
everybody
wanted
to
go
and
there
threatened
to
be
trouble
over
the
selection
so
we
picked
the
highest
ratings
from
the
whole
service
if
there
ever
was
such
a
thing
as
a
picked
force
we
shall
have
it
with
us
what
mean
you
are
going
are
you
try
to
keep
me
from
it
the
names
of
all
five
of
us
were
put
in
a
hat
and
i
was
lucky
well
you
may
come
in
handy
at
that
brandon
conceded
and
the
big
boss
himself
hi
chief
ho
brandon
ho
westfall
newton
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
ipc
shook
hands
with
the
two
scientists
your
martians
and
venerians
are
in
lounge
fifteen
i
suppose
that
you
have
a
lot
of
things
to
thrash
out
so
you
may
as
well
start
now
everything
is
being
attended
to
i
take
charge
now
you
going
along
too
asked
brandon
going
along
i
this
cruise
newton
declared
i
may
take
advice
from
you
on
some
things
and
from
crowninshield
on
others
but
i
am
in
charge
all
x
it
a
relief
at
that
and
brandon
and
westfall
went
to
join
their
in
the
designated
room
of
the
what
a
contrast
was
there
as
the
representatives
of
three
worlds
met
all
six
men
were
of
the
same
original
stock
or
of
a
similar
evolution
science
has
not
even
yet
decided
the
question
definitely
their
minds
were
very
much
alike
but
their
respective
environments
had
so
variantly
developed
their
bodily
structures
that
to
outward
seeming
they
had
but
little
in
common
through
countless
thousands
of
generations
the
martians
had
become
acclimated
to
a
planet
having
little
air
less
water
and
characterized
by
abrupt
transitions
from
searing
heat
to
bitter
cold
from
blinding
light
to
almost
impenetrable
darkness
eight
feet
tall
and
correspondingly
massive
they
could
barely
stand
against
the
gravitational
force
of
the
earth
almost
three
times
as
great
as
that
of
mars
but
the
two
martian
scientists
struggled
to
their
feet
as
the
terrestrials
entered
as
you
were
fellows
lie
down
again
and
take
it
easy
brandon
suggested
in
the
common
interplanetarian
tongue
we
be
away
from
here
very
soon
then
we
can
ease
off
we
greet
our
friends
standing
as
long
as
we
can
stand
and
towering
a
full
two
feet
above
brandon
own
alcantro
and
fedanzo
in
turn
engulfed
his
comparatively
tiny
hand
in
a
paw
and
lifted
briefly
the
inner
lids
of
eyes
for
the
martian
skin

not
like
ours
it
is
of
incredible
thickness
dry
pliable
rubbery
and
utterly
without
sensation
heavily
lined
with
fat
and
filled
throughout
its
volume
with
tiny
which
make
it
an
almost
perfect
of
heat
and
which
prevent
absolutely
the
evaporation
of
the
precious
moisture
of
the
body
for
the
same
reasons
their
huge
and
eyes
are
never
exposed
but
look
through
sealed
clear
windows
of
membrane
over
which
may
be
drawn
at
will
one
or
all
of
four
pairs
of
lids
lids

insulators

the
air
they
exhale
carries
from
their
bodies
a
minimum
of
the
heat
and
moisture
for
the
passages
of
their
nostrils
do
not
lead
directly
to
the
lungs
as
do
ours
they
are
merely
the
intakes
for
a
tortuous
system
of
tubes
comprising
a
veritable
so
that
the
air
finally
expelled
is
in
almost
perfect
equilibrium
with
the
incoming
supply

temperature
and
in
moisture
content

grayish
tan
in
color
naked
and
hairless
though
now
out
of
deference
to
terrestrial
conventions
wearing
light
robes
of
silk
indifferent
alike
to
any
extreme
of
heat
or
cold
light
or
darkness
such
were
the
two
forbidding
beings
who
arose
to
greet
their
terrestrial
friends
then
again
reclined
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
given
to
drink
westfall
made
sure
that
they
had
been
tendered
the
highest
hospitality
of
mars
we
have
drunk
full
deeply
thanks
and
it
was
not
really
necessary
for
we
drank
scarcely
three
weeks
ago
brandon
and
westfall
turned
then
and
greeted
the
two
venerians
as
different
from
the
martians
as
they
were
from
the
terrestrials
of
earthly
stature
form
and
strength
yet
each
was
encased
in
a
stretched
like
a
and
would
live
therein
or
in
the
special
venerian
rooms
of
the
vessel
as
long
as
the
journey
should
endure
for
the
atmosphere
of
venus
is
more
than
twice
as
dense
as
ours
is
practically
saturated
with
carries
an
extremely
high
concentration
of
carbon
dioxide
and
in
their
suits
and
rooms
is
held
at
a
temperature
of
one
hundred
and
ten
degrees
fahrenheit
the
lenses
of
their
helmets
were
of
heavy
composition
protecting
their
skins
and
red
eyes
from
all
actinic
rays
for
the
venerian
lives
upon
the
bottom
of
an
everlasting
sea
of
fog
and
his
thin
epidermis
utterly
without
pigmentation
burns
and
blisters
as
frightfully
at
the
least
exposure
to
actinic
light
as
does
ours
at
the
touch
of
a
iron
out
in
space
at
last
cruising
idly
with
the
acceleration
set
at
a
point
bearable
for
the
martians
westfall
called
the
meeting
to
order
and
outlined
the
situation
facing
them
brandon
then
handed
around
folios
of
papers
upon
which
the
venerians
turned
the
invisible
beams
of
the
illuminators
upon
their
helmets
thus
flooding
them
with
the
light
to
which
their
retinas
were
most
responsive
here
the
data
brandon
began
as
you
see
from

we
can
already
draw
any
amount
of

we
shall
need
from

put

his
fellow
venerian
any
more

the
foot

those
radiations
originate
we
know
not
where
probably
as
a
result
of
reactions
the
fields
of
force
of
our
hosts
merely
intercept
these
radiations
as
a
turbine
intercepts
the
water
we
merely
use
a
portion
of
their
energy
before
permitting
them
to
go
on
to
we
know
not
what
end
truly
you
have
made
a
notable
achievement
in
science
tellurian
friends
and
we
congratulate
you
upon
its
accomplishment
please
proceed
upon
the
following
sheets
are
described
the
forces
employed
by
the
jovians
as
we
shall
call
them
until
we
find
out
who
or
what
they
really
are
we
will
discuss
these
forces
later
for
each
force
we
have
already
calculated
a
screen
and
we
have
also
calculated
various
other
forces
of
our
own
with
which
we
hope
to
arm
ourselves
before
we
reach
ganymede
the
problems
facing
us
are
complex
since
there
are
some
nine
thousand
forcebands
of
the
order
in
which
we
are
working
each
differing
from
all
the
others
as
much
as
torque
differs
from
tension
or
as
much
as
red
differs
from
green
therefore
we
have
appealed
to
you
for
help
knowing
that
we
could
do
but
little
alone
alcantro
and
fedanzo
will
supervise
the
construction
of
the
generators
of
the
various
fields
from
these
calculations
dol
kenor
will
correlate
power
and
electricity
to
and
with
the
fields
westfall
and
i
will
help
work
out
the
theoretical
difficulties
as
they
arise
pyraz
amonar
who
can
devise
and
build
a
machine
to
perform
any
conceivable
mechanical
task
will
help
us
all
in
the
many
mechanical
difficulties
we
shall
certainly
encounter
discussion
of
any
point
is
now
in
order
step
by
step
and
equation
after
equation
the
calculations
and
plans
were
gone
over
until
every
detail
was
clear
in
each
mind
then
the
men
bent
to
their
tasks
behind
them
not
only
the
extraordinarily
complete
facilities
of
that
gigantic
workshop
which
was
the
but
also
the
full
power
of
the
detachment
of
police
the
very
cream
of
the
young
manhood
of
the
planet
week
after
toilsome
week
the
unremitting
labor
went
on
and
little
by
little
the
massive
cruiser
of
the
void
became
endowed
with
an
offensive
and
defensive
armament
incredible
an
armament
conceived
in
the
fertile
and
daring
brain
of
a
sheer
genius
guided
only
by
the
knowledge
that
such
things
were
already
in
existence
somewhere
reduced
to
working
theory
by
a
precise
mathematical
logician
translated
into
fields
of
force
by
the
greatest
known
experts
powered
by
the
indefatigable
efforts
of
an
electrical
wizard
made
possible
by
the
artful
mechanical
devices
of
the
greatest
inventor
that
three
worlds
had
ever
known
thus
it
was
that
they
approached
ganymede
ready
with
blanketing
screens
full
out
save
for
one
narrow
working

and
with
a
observer
at
every
plate
when
even
the
westfall
was
convinced
that
their
preparations
were
as
complete
as
they
could
be
made
with
the
limited
information
at
hand
brandon
directed
a
beam
upon
the

tapped
off
a
brief
message
stevens

newton
and
stevens
brandon
at
the
controls
scanning
his
screens
narrowly
dropped
the
vessel
down
to
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
point
of
origin
of
carrier
beam
without
incident
then
spoke
to
westfall
at
his
side
with
a
grin
nice
layout
the
kid
got
down
there
quince
it
too
bad
do
look
like
we
going
to
get
any
action
for
our
money
shame
too
what
the
use
of
wasting
it
now
that
we
got
it
all
made
we
are
not
done
yet
cautioned
westfall
and
even
as
he
spoke
an
alarm
bell
burst
into
strident
clamor
one
of
their
detector
screens
was
telling
the
world
that
it
had
encountered
a
dangerous
frequency
the
new
flared
instantly
along
the
line
automatically
laid
down
by
the
detector
and
upon
the
closely
ruled
micrometer
screen
of
brandon
desk
there
glowed
in
natural
color
the
image
of
a
globular
approaching
them
with
terrific
speed
men
all
stationed
of
course
crown
stationed
and
ready
crowninshield
phones
at
his
ears
and
microphone
at
his
lips
was
staring
intently
into
his
own
plate
kinda
think
i
do
most
of
it
from
here
but
you
ca
always
tell
if
they
get
inside
my
guard
you
all
know
what
to
do
all
x
expecting
another
such
hollow
victory
as
the
other
hexan
vessel
had
won
over
the
defenseless
the
small
stranger
flashed
nearer
and
nearer
that
huge
and
featureless
football
of
armor
steel
within
range
she
launched
her
flaming
plane
of
energy
but
this
time
that
jovian
sheet
of
force
did
not
encounter
unprotected
and
steel
upon
the
outer
flaming
white
into
incandescent
defense
the
furious
bolt
spent
itself
and
in
the
instant
of
the
launching
of
the
searing
blade
of
flame
brandon
had
gone
into
action
switch
after
switch
drove
home
and
one
after
another
those
frightful
fields
of
force
those
products
of
the
mightiest
minds
of
three
planets
were
hurled
out
against
the
tiny
jovian
sphere
driven
as
they
were
by
the
millions
upon
millions
of
horsepower
stored
in
the
accumulators
of
the
they
formed
a
coruscating
spherical
shell
of
intolerable
energy
all
around
the
enemy
vessel
but
even
their
prodigious
force
was
held
at
bay
by
the
powerful
defensive
screens
of
the
smaller
but
attack
the
jovian
could
not
every
resource
at
her
command
being
necessary
to
fend
off
the
terrific
of
her
intended
prey
and
she
turned
in
flight
small
and
agile
as
she
was
the
enormous
mass
of
the
precluded
any
possibility
of
maneuvering
with
the
jovian
but
brandon
had
no
intention
of
maneuvering
rapid
as
the
motions
of
the
stranger
were
and
frantic
as
was
her
dodging
the
terrific
forces
of
the
tractor
beams
of
the
interplanetary
vessel
held
her
in
an
unbreakable
grip
and
although
she
dragged
the
massive
hither
and
thither
she
could
not
escape
hm
m
m
mused
brandon
we
seem
to
be
getting
nowhere
fast
how
much
power
we
using
mac
and
how
much
have
we
got
coming
in
output
thousand
kilofranks
replied
macdonald
the
first
assistant
intake
thousand
not
so
good
ca
hold
out
forever
at
that
rate
shove
out
the
receptor
screens
to
the
limit
and
drive
they
figure
a
top
of
sixty
thousand
but
we
ought
to
pick
up
a
little
extra
from
that
blaze
out
there
drive
full
out
or
up
to
whichever
comes
first
ca
seem
to
crush
his
screens
so
i
guess
we
have
to
try
something
else
and
a
thoughtful
expression
came
over
his
face
as
he
slowly
extended
his
hand
toward
another
switch
with
a
questioning
glance
at
westfall
better
not
do
that
yet
norman
use
that
only
as
a
last
resort
after
everything
else
has
failed
yeah
i
scared
to
death
of
trying
it
and
it
is
necessary
yet
he
must
have
an
open
slit
somewhere
to
work
through
just
as
we
have
feel
around
for
it
a
while
is
there
any
way
of
hetrodyning
the
new
visiray
upon
the
exploring
frequency
hm
m
never
thought
of
that
it
would
be
nice
too
i
think
we
can
do
it
too
watch
quince
and
holler
if
they
start
anything
he
abandoned
his
desk
and
established
the
necessary
connections
between
the
visiray
apparatus
and
the
controls
of
his
board
there
was
a
fierce
glare
from
the
plate
as
he
closed
the
switch
and
he
leaped
back
with
his
hands
over
his
eyes
temporarily
blinded
wow
that
hot
stuff
he
exclaimed
it
works
all
x
to
the
taste
as
he
donned
his
heavy
and
resumed
his
place
after
making
certain
that
the
visiray
was
precisely
synchronized
and
phased
with
the
searching
frequency
he
built
up
the
power
of
that
beam
until
it
was
using
twenty
thousand
kilofranks
then
by
delicately
manipulating
the
variable
condensers
and
inductances
of
his
sensitive
shunting
relay
circuits
he
slowly
shifted
that
frightful
rod
of
energy
from
frequency
to
frequency
staring
into
the
brilliant
blankness
of
his
micrometer
screen
as
he
did
so
after
a
few
minutes
of
search
the
screen
darkened
somewhat
revealing
the
image
of
the
jovian
globe
brandon
instantly
shifted
into
that
one
channel
the
entire
power
of
his
attack
steadying
the
controls
to
bring
the
sphere
of
the
jovians
into
the
sharpest
possible
focus
knowing
that
he
had
found
the
open
slit
and
that
through
it
there
was
pouring
upon
the
enemy
the
full
power
of
his
terrible
weapon
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
before
the
jovians
could
detect
the
attack
and
close
the
slit
he
saw
a
portion
of
the
wall
of
their
vessel
flare
into
white
heat
and
literally
explode
outward
in
puffs
and
gouts
of
flaming
molten
metal
and
of
incandescent
gases
but
the
thrust
savage
as
it
was
had
not
been
fatal
and
the
enemy
countered
instantly
now
that
the
crushing
force
of
the
attack
was
lessened
for
a
moment
through
another
slit
there
poured
a
beam
of
energy
equal
to
the
terrestrials
own
a
beam
of
such
intense
power
that
the
outer
screen
of
the
flared
from
red
through
the
spectrum
to
and
beyond
the
violet
and
went
black
in
less
than
a
second
and
the
inner
screen
had
almost
gone
down
before
brandon
lightning
hands
could
restore
the
complete
coverage
that
so
effectively
blanketed
the
forces
of
the
enemy
well
we
back
to
the
announced
brandon
calmly
a
good
gag
they
did
have
time
to
locate
our
working
slit
if
they
had
pushed
that
stuff
through
our
open
channel
we
have
gotten
frizzled
up
some
around
the
edges
as
it
was
we
got
the
edge
on
that
exchange
take
it
from
your
uncle
dudley
quince
that
bird
knows
that
he
been
nudged
again
he
searched
the
entire
band
for
an
opening
but
could
find
none
the
enemy
had
apparently
retired
into
a
tightly
closed
shell
of
energy
the
small
vessel
no
longer
struggled
nor
even
moved
but
was
merely
resisting
passively
not
an
open
channel
not
even
one
for
him
to
work
through
he
wiggle
well
that
wo
get
him
anything
we
so
much
bigger
than
he
is
that
we
can
outlast
him
and
will
get
him
some
time
since
bound
to
run
out
of
power
before
we
do
i
do
believe
he
can
receive
anything
sealed
up
as
he
is
and
he
ca
have
accumulators
enough
more
efficient
than
ours
to
make
up
the
difference
can
he
quince
it
is
quite
possible
for
instance
although
we
have
never
heard
of
any
progress
being
made
along
such
lines
it
has
been
pointed
out
repeatedly
that
synthesis
of
a
element
of
very
high
atomic
weight
would
theoretically
yield
an
almost
perfect
accumulator
one
many
thousands
of
times
as
efficient
as
ours
in
ratio
then
too
you
realize
of
course
that
there
is
a
bare
possibility
that
energy
may
not
be
absolutely
impossible
nix
on
that
quince
i
stand
for
a
lot
but
not
for
that
last
idea
it
hard
to
say
that
anything
impossible
of
course
except
things
made
so
by
definition
or
by
being
contrary
to
observational
facts
but
the
best
work
shows
that
energy
is
just
about
as
impossible
as
anything
can
well
be
it
has
been
shown
pretty
conclusively
that
all
ordinary
matter
is
already
in
its
most
stable
state
so
that
work
must
be
done
upon
any
ordinary
atom
to
decompose
it
besides
if
he
had
either
radioactive
accumulators
or
energy
he
would
have
cut
us
up
long
ago
nope
the
answer
is
that
he
probably
yelled
for
help
and
is
trying
to
hold
out
until
it
gets
here
was
rejoinder
what
can
we
do
about
it
asked
quince
do
know
yet
i
do
know
though
that
we
are
half
as
ready
for
trouble
as
i
thought
we
were
there
a
dozen
things
i
want
to
do
that
i
ca
because
we
have
got
the
stuff
do
say
told
you
so
either
i
know
you
did
you
the
champion
thinker
of
the
century
alcantro
here
round
up
the
gang
will
you
and
figure
me
out
a
screen
and
a
set
of
meters
that
will
indicate
an
open
band
we
lose
too
much
time
feeling
around
anyhow
and
we
too
apt
to
take
one
on
the
chin
while
doing
it
also
you
ought
to
make
it
so
it
shoot
a
jolt
into
the
opening
while
you
at
it
said
brandon
we
shall
begin
at
once
and
the
massive
martian
as
he
replied
stepped
over
to
the
calculating
machine
well
quince
we
ca
do
much
to
him
this
way
he
crawled
into
a
hole
and
pulled
the
hole
in
after
him
gosh
i
wish
we
had
more
stuff
after
all
we
have
everything
whose
necessity
and
practicability
could
have
been
foreseen
in
the
light
of
our
information
we
can
of
course
go
further
you
chirped
it
but
we
ca
let
things
ride
this
way
or
we
get
our
hair
singed
we
have
to
decorate
him
with
the
grand
slam
i
guess
yes
it
seems
as
though
the
time
for
emergency
measures
has
arrived
put
everything
on
the
center
of
the
band
that
is
probably
the
best
frequency
to
use
in
a
case
of
this
kind
he
ca
control
so
we
push
him
down
close
to
the
ground
before
we
go
to
work
on
him
so
we
do
have
so
far
to
fall
if
anything
goes
screwy
with
the
works
here
hoping
nothing
gives
away
the
almost
against
the
flaming
screens
of
the
jovian
and
both
vessels
very
close
to
the
surface
of
the
satellite
brandon
tested
the
power
leads
briefly
adjusted
dials
and
coils
then
touched
the
button
which
actuated
the
relays
relays
which
in
turn
drove
home
the
gigantic
switches
that
launched
a
fearsome
and
as
yet
untried
weapon
instantly
released
the
full
seven
hundred
thousand
kilofranks
of
their
stupendous
batteries
of
accumulators
drove
into
the
middle
frequency
of
the
attacking
band
and
brandon
heart
was
in
his
mouth
as
he
stared
into
the
plate
to
see
what
would
happen
he
saw
everything
in
the
held
fast
and
under
the
impact
of
the
inconceivable
plane
of
force
the
screens
of
the
enemy
vessel
flared
instantly
into
an
even
more
intense
incandescence
and
in
that
same
fleeting
instant
went
down
and
all
defenses
vanished
as
the
metal
sphere
fell
apart
into
two
halves
as
would
an
apple
under
the
full
blow
of
a
brandon
quickly
shut
off
his
power
and
stared
in
relief
into
the
central
compartment
of
the
globular
ship
of
space
now
laid
open
and
saw
there
figures
one
or
two
of
which
were
moving
weakly
as
he
looked
one
of
these
feebly
attempted
to
raise
a
peculiar
tubular
something
toward
a
helplessly
fettered
body
even
as
brandon
snatched
away
the
threatening
weapon
with
a
beam
of
force
he
recognized
the
captive
great
cat
there
breckenridge
he
gasped
and
directed
a
lifting
beam
upon
the
bound
and
unconscious
prisoner
rapidly
but
carefully
he
was
brought
through
the
double
airlock
and
into
the
control
room
where
his
shackles
were
cut
away
and
where
he
soon
revived
under
vigorous
and
skilful
treatment
any
more
of
you
in
there
did
i
hit
any
of
you
with
that
beam
demanded
brandon
intensely
as
soon
as
breckenridge
showed
signs
of
understanding
king
in
there
somewhere
and
there
a
callistonian
human
being
that
you
must
kill
the
chief
pilot
replied
weakly
and
with
great
effort
in
every
word
do
believe
that
you
hit
anybody
direct
but
the
shock
was
pretty
bad
having
delivered
his
message
he
lay
back
exhausted
all
x
crown
give
me
a
squad
not
on
your
life
barked
the
general
this
is
my
job
and
i
do
it
myself
your
job
is
fighting
the
stay
with
it
not
in
seven
thousand
years
i
in
on
this
too
brandon
protested
but
was
decisively
overruled
by
newton
you
belong
right
here
at
this
board
since
no
one
else
can
handle
it
the
way
you
can
stay
here
he
commanded
all
right
grudgingly
assented
the
physicist
and
held
the
upright
with
her
stern
buried
a
few
feet
deep
in
the
ground
he
watched
the
wreckage
jealously
while
crowninshield
and
forty
helmeted
men
issued
from
the
service
door
in
the
lower
compartment
and
advanced
upon
the
two
halves
of
the
enemy
vessel
as
no
hostile
demonstrations
ensued
scaling
ladders
were
quickly
placed
and
with
weapons
at
the
alert
the
police
boarded
the
hemispheres
manacled
the
still
helpless
beings
visible
and
after
laying
down
a
fog
of
stupefying
gas
vanished
into
compartments
beyond
the
metal
partitions
after
a
short
time
they
reappeared
and
climbed
down
the
scaling
ladders
carrying
several
inert
forms
and
brandon
spoke
into
his
transmitter
king
all
x
crowninshield
i
think
so
not
being
in
the
control
room
he
was
not
as
badly
shocked
by
the
passage
of
the
beam
as
were
breckenridge
and
those
you
saw
the
things
in
the
other
rooms
were
about
ready
to
fight
so
we
gave
them
a
little
whiff
of
tritylamin
but
captain
king
will
be
as
good
as
ever
in
a
few
minutes
fine
business
the
police
entered
the
the
service
doors
clanged
shut
and
brandon
turned
to
westfall
while
they
coming
up
i
guess
i
pick
up
perce
and
miss
newton
we
better
get
them
aboard
and
beat
it
while
we
all
in
one
piece
but
even
before
he
could
send
out
the
exploring
beam
of
his
communicator
the
voice
of
stevens
came
from
the
receiver
hi
brandon
and
westfall
we
watched
the
whole
show
congratulations
fellows
welcome
to
ganymede
you
are
in
our
valley
we
upstream
from
you
about
three
hundred
meters
just
below
the
falls
on
the
meadow
side
all
x
brandon
acknowledged
we
saw
you
come
on
out
where
we
can
pick
you
up
we
got
to
get
away
from
here
and
get
away
fast
we
carry
off
the
pieces
of
that
ship
too
quince
we
may
be
able
to
get
a
lot
of
pointers
from
it
and
brandon
swung
mighty
tractor
beams
upon
the
severed
halves
of
the
jovian
vessel
then
extended
a
couple
of
smaller
rays
to
meet
the
two
little
figures
racing
across
the
smooth
green
meadow
toward
the
chapter
x
among
friends
at
last
the
time
for
the
landing
of
the
was
drawing
near
and
the
castaways
upon
ganymede
had
donned
their
only
suits
of
earthly
clothing
instead
of
the
makeshifts
of
canvas
and
leather
they
had
been
wearing
so
long
thorns
and
underbrush
had
pierced
and
torn
their
once
natty
outing
costumes
and
sparks
and
flying
drops
of
molten
metal
from
stevens
first
crude
forges
had
burned
in
them
many
gaping
holes
i
did
the
best
i
could
with

they
look
pretty
crumby
nadia
wrinkled
her

she
studied

staring
patches
everywhere
so
evident
both
in
her
own
apparel
of
gray
silk
and
in
the
heavy
whipcord
clothing
of
her
companion
you
did
a
great
job
considering
what
you
had
to
work
with
he
reassured
her
besides
who
cares
about
a
few
patches
i
feel
a
lot
more
civilized
in
my
own
clothes
do
you
well
yes
she
admitted
they
silk
anyway
even
if
they
look
like
much
and
i
just
reveling
in
the
feel
of
them
next
to
me
after
the
horrible
rough
scratchy
things
i
been
wearing
see
anything
yet
not
yet
stevens
had
been
scanning
the
heavens
with
a
pair
of
binoculars
that
does
mean
much
though
as
they
be
just
about
in
the
sun
and
they
be
coming
like
a
scared
dog
might
as
well
put
away
these
glasses
we
probably
wo
be
able
to
see
them
until
they
right
on
top
of
us
what
shall
we
take
with
us
do
know
nothing
probably
since
they
must
have
a
campaign
already
mapped
out
i
like
to
salvage
a
lot
of
this
junk
but
i
afraid
we
wo
be
able
to
i
going
to
take
my
bow
and
arrows
though
you
absolutely
that
one
thing
that
better
than
anything
i
ever
had
on
earth
this
bow
of
mine
is
perfect
there
they
are
three
rousing
cheers
say
but
that
old
hulk
looks
good
to
me
does
she
though
cried
nadia
vibrant
with
excitement
you
know
steve
i
hardly
dared
really
to
believe
it
until
this
very
minute
oh
look
what
that
the
had
stopped
in
midair
and
they
could
see
far
in
the
distance
the
tiny
sphere
of
the
jovians
rushing
to
the
attack
oh
how
horrible
cried
the
girl
her
voice
breaking
i
afraid
steve
you
need
be
ace
i
told
you
they
wo
go
off
as
long
as
westfall
is
on
the
job
they
ready
for
anything
or
they
would
be
here
but
just
the
same
i
wish
that
they
had
that
titanian
mirror
and
a
couple
of
those
bombs
in
a
moment
more
the
jovian
plane
of
force
was
launched
the
powerful
flared
into
sparkling
defense
and
the
battle
was
on
held
as
the
castaways
were
by
that
spectacular
duel
yet
stevens
trained
mind
warned
him
of
the
perils
of
their
position
grab
your
bow
and
we
beat
it
and
he
rapidly
led
her
away
from
the
steel
structures
to
an
open
hillside
well
away
from
any
projection
tree
or
sharp
point
of
rock
if
that
keeps
up
very
long
we
going
to
see
some
real
fireworks
and
i
do
know
whether
there
will
be
enough
left
of
our
plant
here
to
salvage
or
not
everything
is
grounded
of
course
but
i
do
believe
that
ordinary
grounds
will
amount
to
much
against
what
coming
what
you
talking
about
demanded
nadia
look
he
replied
pointing
and
as
he
spoke
a
terrific
bolt
of
lightning
launched
itself
from
the
incandescent
screen
of
the
jovian
vessel
upon
their
slender
tower
which
subsided
instantly
into
a
confused
mass
of
molten
and
twisted
metal
as
the
power
of
the
beams
was
increased
and
as
the
combatants
drew
nearer
and
nearer
the
ground
the
lightning
display
grew
ever
more
violent
well
below
the
canyon
as
the
warring
vessels
were
the
and
penstock
did
not
suffer
at
all
and
only
a
few
discharges
struck
the
discharges
which
were
carried
easily
to
ground
by
the
enormous
thickness
of
her
armor
but
every
prominent
object
for
hundreds
of
yards
below
the
was
literally
blasted
out
of
existence
radio
tower
directors
and
fittings
trees
shrubs
sharp
points
of
rock
all
were
struck
again
and
again
fused
destroyed
utterly
obliterated
by
the
inconceivable
energy
being
dissipated
by
those
impregnable
screens
of
force
even
almost
flat
upon
the
ground
as
the
spectators
were
each
individual
hair
upon
their
heads
strove
fiercely
to
stand
erect
so
heavily
charged
was
the
very
air
arm
was
blue
for
days
such
was
nadia
grip
upon
it
and
she
herself
could
scarcely
breathe
in
that
mighty
arm
constriction
but
each
was
conscious
only
of
that
incredibly
violent
struggle
of
that
duel
to
the
death
being
waged
there
before
their
eyes
with
those
frightful
weapons
hitherto
unknown
to
man
they
saw
the
triumphant
and
stevens
led
the
dancing
girl
back
into
their
dwelling
of
steel
danger
all
over
now
radio
gone
but
we
should
fret
a
lot
about
that
it
has
done
its
stuff
we
can
use
the
communicators
and
now
sweetheart
i
going
to
kiss
you
for
the
first
time
in
seven
lifetimes
locked
in
each
other
arms
they
watched
the
scene
until
stevens
thought
it
time
to
send
his
message
then
running
hand
in
hand
toward
the
huge
they
were
snatched
apart
and
drawn
up
toward
the
double
airlocks
of
the
main
entrance
pressure
gradually
brought
up
to
normal
they
were
ushered
into
the
control
room
where
nadia
glanced
around
quickly
and
almost
took
her
father
off
his
feet
by
her
tempestuous
rush
into
his
arms
oh
daddy
darling
i
just
knew
you
come
along
i
have
seen
you
for
a
million
years
she
exclaimed
rapturously
and
bill
too
wonderful
as
she
fervently
embraced
a
young
man
wearing
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
of
interplanetary
police
ouch
bill
breaking
all
my
ribs
well
you
cracked
three
of
mine
maybe
you
do
know
how
husky
you
are
but
you
got
a
squeeze
like
a
full
grown
boa
constrictor
he
held
her
off
at
arms
length
and
studied
her
with
admiration
gee
it
fine
to
see
you
again
sis
you
looking
great
too
i
think
i
bring
my
girl
out
here
to
live
you
always
were
a
knockout
but
now
you
the
loveliest
thing
i
ever
saw
he
made
his
way
through
the
group
surrounding
stevens
while
nadia
and
her
father
talked
earnestly
i
bill
newton
thanks
he
said
simply
holding
out
his
hand
which
was
taken
in
a
grip
bring
him
over
here
bill
nadia
called
before
stevens
could
find
a
reply
i
do
know
how
to
say
anything
stevens
the
officer
continued
in
embarrassment
as
the
two
men
turned
to
obey
the
summons
she
a
good
kid
and
we
think
a
lot
of
her
we
about
given
her
up
we
she
oh
rats
what
the
use
you
know
what
i
mean
you
there
stevens
like
a
clam
it
ace
stevens
interrupted
i
get
you
to
nineteen
decimals
and
you
do
half
know
just
what
a
good
kid
she
really
is
she
the
reason
we
here
we
were
down
pretty
close
to
for
a
while
she
stood
up
when
i
wilted
she
got
everything
she
clam
it
yourself
steve
do
believe
a
word
of
it
dad
and
bill
nadia
voice
dripped
scorn
why
he
di
please
newton
voice
was
somewhat
husky
as
he
silenced
the
clamor
of
the
three
young
people
all
talking
at
once
i
will
not
embarrass
you
further
by
trying
to
say
something
that
no
words
can
express
you
told
me
that
you
would
take
care
of
her
and
i
learn
that
you
have
done
so
i
did
what
i
could
but
most
of
the
credit
belongs
to
her
no
matter
what
she
says
stevens
insisted
anyway
sir
here
she
is
alive
well
and
unharmed
and
his
eyes
bore
unflinchingly
the
piercing
gaze
of
the
older
man
who
was
reassured
and
pleased
by
what
he
read
therein
one
thing
i
want
to
say
right
now
though
that
may
make
you
feel
like
canceling
the
welcome
i
loved
nadia
even
before
the
was
attacked
and
since
then
coming
to
know
her
as
i
have
the
feeling
has
lessened
any
nadia
has
already
told
me
all
about
you
two
said
her
father
and
the
welcome
stands
if
you
could
take
care
of
her
as
well
as
you
have
done
since
you
left
the
i
have
no
doubt
of
your
ability
to
take
care
of
her
for
life
we
have
been
examining
the
work
you
have
done
here
son
and
the
more
i
saw
of
it
the
more
amazed
i
became
that
you
could
have
succeeded
as
you
did
we
are
deeply
indebted
just
a
minute
there
my
call
i
wanted
in
fifteen
i
see
you
again
directly
hi
norm
stevens
further
relieved
the
surcharged
atmosphere
as
soon
as
you
and
quince
can
leave
those
controls
come
over
and
see
us
will
you
all
x
coming
up
sounded
brandon
deep
and
pleasant
bass
and
the
two
rescuers
who
had
tactfully
avoided
the
family
reunion
came
over
and
greeted
the
third
of
their
triumvirate
ho
perce
you
look
fit
brandon
ran
an
expert
hand
over
arm
and
shoulder
looks
as
if
he
might
last
a
round
or
two
he
quince
you
are
looking
fine
steve
neither
of
you
appear
any
the
worse
for
your
experiences
so
this
is
nadia
we
have
heard
of
you
miss
newton
i
believe
that
knowing
dad
she
replied
thanks
both
of
you
for
digging
us
out
i
heard
about
you
two
and
i
going
to
kiss
you
both
westfall
the
silent
and
reserved
was
taken
aback
but
brandon
met
her
more
than
all
x
nadia
payment
in
full
received
and
hereby
acknowledged
he
laughed
as
he
allowed
her
feet
to
return
to
the
floor
even
if
it
was
some
stout
lads
from
mars
and
venus
that
did
all
the
work
we
take
the
reward
especially
since
alcantro
and
fedanzo
could
feel
even
such
a
salute
as
that
one
was
and
i
ca
picture
you
kissing
a
venerian
even
if
you
could
get
to
him
whenever
you
get
lost
again
be
sure
to
let
us
know
now
that
you
got
our
address
if
i
know
perce
at
all
you
heard
of
us
you
sick
of
it
and
us
it
a
weakness
of
his
talking
too
much
why
it
no
such
th
began
nadia
but
broke
off
as
an
aide
came
up
and
saluted
smartly
pardon
me
but
general
crowninshield
requests
that
doctor
brandon
doctor
westfall
and
doctor
stevens
join
the
council
in
lounge
fifteen
as
soon
as
convenient
he
saluted
again
and
turned
away
yes
that
right
folks
we
got
to
take
a
lot
of
steps
fast
see
you
later
and
brandon
taking
each
of
the
other
two
by
an
arm
marched
them
away
toward
the
designated
assembly
room
there
already
seated
at
a
long
table
were
czuv
king
and
breckenridge
all
fully
recovered
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
newton
and
crowninshield
alcantro
and
fedanzo
the
martian
scientists
were
listening
intently
as
were
the
two
venerians
dol
kenor
and
pyraz
amonar
the
eyes
of
the
three
newcomers
however
did
not
linger
upon
the
group
at
the
table
but
were
irresistibly
drawn
to
one
corner
of
the
room
where
six
creatures
lay
in
the
heaviest
manacles
afforded
by
the
stores
of
the
interplanetary
police
not
only
were
they
manacled
but
each
was
facing
a
held
by
a
soldier
whose
expression
showed
plainly
that
he
would
rather
press
the
lethal
contact
than
not
oh
those
the
things
we
fighting
brandon
stopped
at
the
threshold
and
stared
intently
at
the
captive
hexans
goggling
green
eyes
glaring
venomously
they
were
lying
quiet
but
tense
mighty
muscles
ready
to
burst
into
berserk
activity
should
the
attention
of
a
guard
waver
for
a
single
instant
but
little
more
than
half
as
large
as
the
savage
creatures
with
whom
stevens
had
fought
in
the
mountain
glade
upon
ganymede
the
hexans
resembled
those
aborigines
only
as
civilized
men
might
resemble
gigantic
primordial
savages
of
our
own
earth
brandon
gaze
went
from
short
powerful
legs
up
a
round
red
body
to
the
enormous
freakish
double
pair
of
shoulders
with
its
peculiar
universal
jointing
from
the
double
shoulders
sprang
four
limbs
the
front
pair
of
which
were
undoubtedly
arms
terminating
in
large
but
fairly
normal
hands
the
intermediate
limbs
were
longer
than
the
legs
and
were
much
more
powerful
than
the
arms
and
ended
in
members
that
were
very
evidently
feet
and
hands
combined
what
in
a
human
being
would
be
the
back
of
the
hand
was
the
sole
of
the
foot
when
walking
upon
that
foot
the
long
and
dexterous
thumb
and
fingers
were
curled
up
out
of
the
way
and
protected
from
injury
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
from
the
monstrous
shoulders
there
rose
a
rather
long
and
very
flexible
yet
massive
and
columnar
neck
supporting
a
head
neither
human
nor
bestial
a
head
utterly
unknown
to
terrestrial
history
or
experience
the
massive
cranium
bespoke
a
highly
developed
and
intelligent
brain
as
did
the
three
large
and
expressive
peculiar
triangular
eyes
the
three
sensitive
ears
were
very
long
erect
and
sharply
pointed
each
was
set
immediately
above
an
eye
one
upon
each
side
of
the
head
and
one
in
front
each
ear
was
independently
and
instantly
movable
in
any
direction
to
catch
the
faintest
sound
the
head
like
the
body
and
limbs
was
entirely
devoid
of
hair
the
horns
so
prominent
in
the
savages
stevens
had
seen
were
in
this
highly
intelligent
race
but
vestigial
three
small
sharp
black
protuberances
only
an
inch
in
length
one
surmounting
each
ear
outlining
the
lofty
forehead
the
nose
occupied
almost
the
whole
middle
of
the
face
and
was
not
really
a
nose
it
developed
into
a
small
and
active
proboscis
the
chin
was
receding
almost
to
the
point
of
disappearance
so
that
the
mouth
with
its
multiple
rows
of
small
sharp
teeth
was
almost
hidden
under
the
face
instead
of
being
a
part
of
it
such
were
the
hexans
at
whom
the
big
three
stared
in
undisguised
amazement
attention
please
newton
called
the
meeting
to
order
we
have
learned
that
all
the
passengers
of
the
and
all
the
crew
save
three
are
alive
and
safe
for
the
time
being
most
of
them
are
upon
the
satellite
europa
however
i
understand
that
we
are
not
yet
sufficiently
well
armed
to
withstand
such
an
attack
in
force
as
will
certainly
develop
when
we
move
to
rescue
them
this
seems
to
be
a
war
of
applied
physics
doctor
brandon
as
spokesman
for
the
scientific
forces
of
the
expedition
what
are
your
suggestions
anticipating
an
attack
in
response
to
signals
probably
sent
out
by
the
enemy
replied
brandon
i
headed
directly
south
immediately
we
are
now
well
south
the
ecliptic
and
are
traveling
at
considerably
more
than
full
martian
acceleration
before
making
any
suggestions
i
should
like
to
hear
from
captain
czuv
who
is
more
familiar
than
we
are
with
the
common
enemy
are
they
apt
to
follow
us
can
they
detect
us
if
we
should
drift
at
constant
velocity
and
can
we
search
the
brains
of
the
prisoners
with
his
callistonian
if
he
should
build
one
with
our
help
if
they
are
close
enough
to
us
to
overtake
us
without
too
much
lost
time
they
will
certainly
attack
us
czuv
answered
at
a
nod
from
newton
ordinarily
they
would
pursue
us
to
the
limits
of
the
solar
system
if
necessary
but
since
they
have
suffered
reverses
of
late
and
can
not
spare
any
vessels
they
will
probably
not
pursue
us
far
yes
they
can
detect
us
even
without
the
driving
rays
since
this
vessel
uses
much
electricity
in
its
automatic
machinery
lights
and
so
on
no
our
can
not
take
thoughts
by
force
and
the
hexans
will
exchange
no
ideas
with
us
they
are
implacable
and
deadly
foes
of
all
humanity
irrespective
of
planet
or
race
mercy
is
to
them
unknown
they
neither
give
nor
take
quarter
i
can
bear
him
out
in
that
crowninshield
interposed
grimly
the
first
one
to
recover
snapped
our
ordinary
handcuffs
like
so
much
thread
and
literally
tore
four
men
to
pieces
before
the
rest
of
us
could
ray
him
will
you
need
me
longer
director
newton
i
think
not
general
captain
czuv
you
have
made
no
headway
with
them
asked
the
director
none
whatever
as
i
foretold
they
understand
me
thoroughly
since
two
of
them
speak
my
own
tongue
but
nothing
that
they
have
said
can
ever
be
repeated
here
i
knew
from
the
first
that
all
such
attempts
would
be
fruitless
but
i
have
tried
and
failed
i
suggest
what
i
suggested
at
first
put
them
to
death
here
and
now
as
they
lie
there
for
most
assuredly
they
will
in
some
way
contrive
to
take
toll
of
lives
of
your
own
humanity
if
you
allow
them
to
live
you
may
be
right
said
newton
but
neither
the
general
nor
myself
can
give
the
order
for
their
death
since
interplanetary
law
does
not
countenance
such
summary
action
however
the
guards
are
fully
warned
of
the
peril
and
will
ray
every
prisoner
at
the
first
sign
of
unruliness
general
crowninshield
you
may
remove
the
prisoners
and
deal
with
them
in
accordance
with
pandemonium
reigned
at
crowninshield
signal
for
the
guards
to
leave
the
room
with
their
captives
all
six
had
strained
furiously
at
their
bonds
and
three
of
them
had
broken
free
in
a
flash
throwing
themselves
upon
the
guards
with
unthinkable
ferocity
stevens
seeing
a
in
a
hand
of
one
of
the
prisoners
hurled
his
heavy
chair
instantly
and
with
terrific
force
the
projector
flew
into
the
air
shattered
and
useless
while
the
hexan
was
knocked
into
a
corner
by
the
momentum
of
the
massive
projectile
and
lay
there
stunned
and
broken
brandon
likewise
reacting
instantaneously
had
bent
over
and
seized
a
leg
of
the
table
bracing
his
knee
against
the
corner
with
a
mighty
lunge
of
his
powerful
body
he
wrenched
out
the
support
and
with
a
continuation
of
the
same
motion
he
brought
the
jagged
oak
head
of
his
terrible
club
down
full
upon
the
crown
of
the
second
hexan
who
had
already
torn
one
guard
apart
and
was
leaping
toward
czuv
his
hereditary
foe
in
midflight
he
was
dashed
to
the
floor
his
head
a
shapeless
pulpy
mass
and
brandon
bludgeon
again
aloft
strode
deeper
into
the
fray
for
a
brief
moment
searing
lethal
beams
probed
here
and
there
chains
clanked
and
snapped
once
more
that
ponderous
and
irresistible
oaken
mace
fell
like
the
hammer
of
thor
again
spattering
brains
and
blood
abroad
as
it
descended
then
again
came
silence
the
six
erstwhile
prisoners
lay
dead
but
they
had
taken
five
of
the
guards
with
them
literally
dismembered
hideously
torn
limb
from
limb
by
the
superhuman
incredible
physical
strength
and
utter
ferocity
of
the
hexans
by
common
consent
the
meeting
was
adjourned
to
another
room
for
the
business
in
hand
could
not
be
postponed
captain
czuv
was
right
we
tellurians
could
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
such
a
race
without
the
evidence
of
our
own
senses
newton
reopened
the
meeting
from
this
time
on
we
take
no
prisoners
doctor
brandon
you
may
resume
the
detectors
and
lookouts
will
give
ample
warning
of
any
attack
and
doctor
westfall
has
suggested
that
we
should
have
all
possible
facts
at
hand
before
we
try
to
decide
upon
a
course
of
action
we
should
like
to
hear
the
full
reports
of
captain
king
captain
czuv
chief
pilot
breckenridge
and
doctor
stevens
the
four
men
told
their
stories
tersely
and
rapidly
while
the
others
listened
in
deep
attention
as
the
last
speaker
sat
down
newton
again
turned
to
brandon
who
silently
jerked
his
head
at
westfall
knowing
his
own
inadequacy
in
such
a
situation
realizing
that
here
was
needed
westfall
cold
and
methodical
thinking
director
newton
and
gentlemen
westfall
spoke
calmly
and
precisely
we
have
much
to
do
before
we
can
meet
the
hexans
upon
equal
terms
we
have
many
new
fields
of
force
and
rays
to
develop
of
whose
nature
and
necessity
doctor
brandon
is
already
aware
then
too
we
must
recalculate
our
visirays
so
that
we
can
operate
at
greater
range
and
efficiency
we
must
also
examine
the
hexan
which
is
towing
to
do
which
it
will
be
desirable
to
drift
at
constant
velocity
for
a
time
in
it
we
may
find
instruments
or
devices
as
yet
unknown
to
us
it
also
occurs
to
me
that
since
this
is
an
interplanetary
police
problem
of
the
first
magnitude
we
should
at
once
get
in
touch
with
police
headquarters
so
that
the
peace
fleet
can
be
armed
as
we
ourselves
are
or
shall
be
armed
for
a
large
and
highly
efficient
fleet
will
be
necessary
to
do
that
which
must
be
done
it
is
of
course
a
foregone
conclusion
that
interplanetary
humanity
will
support
the
humanity
of
callisto
against
the
hexans
it
is
also
that
we
must
stay
here
and
rescue
the
tellurians
now
upon
europa
and
callisto
but
we
are
not
yet
in
position
to
decide
just
how
that
rescue
is
to
be
accomplished
four
courses
are
apparently
open
to
us
first
to
attempt
it
as
soon
as
we
shall
have
strengthened
our
armament
as
much
as
is
now
possible
that
would
invite
a
massed
attack
and
in
my
opinion
would
be
foolish
probably
suicidal
second
to
stand
by
at
a
distance
until
the
is
launched
then
to
escort
it
back
to
the
earth
third
to
aid
the
callistonians
as
much
as
possible
while
awaiting
the
completion
of
the
fourth
and
perhaps
the
most
feasible
and
quickest
it
may
be
possible
for
the
callistonian
to
bring
out
a
few
at
a
time
to
us
here
out
in
space
since
they
are
apparently
able
to
come
and
go
at
will
however
i
would
recommend
that
we
make
no
plans
for
the
rescue
as
yet
there
is
little
use
in
attempting
to
deal
with
an
situation
until
we
are
ready
to
act
forthwith
i
suggest
that
we
strengthen
our
offensive
and
defensive
armament
first
then
secure
information
as
to
the
exact
status
of
affairs
both
upon
callisto
and
upon
europa
then
ready
to
act
we
will
do
at
once
whatever
seems
called
for
by
the
situation
then
obtaining
the
program
as
outlined
seems
eminently
sensible
are
there
any
comments
or
suggestions
none
having
been
offered
director
newton
adjourned
the
meeting
and
each
man
attacked
his
particular
problem
true
to
czuv
prediction
the
hexans
did
not
deem
it
worthwhile
to
pursue
the
terrestrial
vessel
so
obviously
and
so
earnestly
fleeing
from
them
and
shortly
the
acceleration
was
cut
off
to
render
possible
a
thorough
study
of
the
two
halves
of
the
spherical
warship
of
the
enemy
scientists
donned
and
studied
every
feature
of
the
strange
vessel
while
mechanics
dismantled
and
transferred
to
the
every
device
and
instrument
of
interest
one
or
two
novel
and
useful
applications
of
rays
and
forces
were
found
their
visirays
and
communicators
in
particular
being
of
a
high
degree
of
efficiency
but
upon
the
whole
the
science
of
the
hexans
was
found
to
be
inferior
to
that
now
known
to
the
scientists
of
interplanetary
flying
laboratory
brandon
studied
the
hexan
most
carefully
and
everything
in
readiness
and
after
a
long
talk
with
westfall
he
called
a
general
conference
in
the
gentlemen
we
have
done
about
everything
we
can
do
for
the
time
being
by
combining
the
best
features
of
the
visirays
and
communicators
of
the
hexans
with
our
own
devices
we
now
have
a
really
excellent
system
of
communication
our
friends
from
mars
and
venus
have
so
altered
and
enlarged
our
that
our
offensive
and
defensive
fields
rays
and
screens
leave
little
to
be
desired
in
power
we
are
far
ahead
of
the
enemy
they
apparently
know
nothing
of
the
possibilities
of
cosmic
radiation
but
depend
upon
transmission
from
their
own
which
transmission
they
have
perfected
to
a
point
far
beyond
anything
reached
by
us
of
the
three
planets
they
do
not
use
accumulators
and
therefore
their
dissipation
is
limited
to
their
maximum
reception
which
is
about
seventy
thousand
kilofranks
since
we
can
dissipate
ten
times
that
amount
of
energy
we
could
withstand
for
a
short
time
the
simultaneous
attacks
of
ten
of
their
vessels
eleven
or
more
of
them
however
would
be
able
to
crush
our
defensive
screens
and
captain
czuv
has
seen
as
many
as
a
hundred
of
their
in
one
formation
furthermore
since
they
have
several
times
our
maximum
acceleration
they
could
concentrate
quickly
upon
any
desired
point
we
could
not
escape
them
by
flight
if
they
really
set
out
to
overtake
us
which
they
certainly
will
do
if
we
again
venture
into
their
territory
therefore
it
is
clear
that
we
can
not
subject
ourselves
to
any
attack
in
force
and
it
follows
that
we
can
not
do
much
of
anything
until
the
police
fleet
of
some
five
hundred
vessels
can
be
and
can
join
us
near
callisto
this
will
require
several
months
at
best
as
you
already
know
it
has
been
decided
that
we
should
not
return
to
any
of
the
minor
planets
as
to
do
so
might
invite
a
hexan
attack
upon
our
police
fleet
which
is
as
yet
unprepared
we
are
now
heading
for
uranus
in
the
hope
that
such
a
course
will
distract
the
attention
of
the
hexans
from
tellus
even
though
they
probably
already
know
that
we
are
tellurians
our
new
communicator
ray
will
reach
any
member
of
the
jovian
system
from
this
point
it
has
been
decided
that
it
is
safe
to
use
it
since
it
employs
an
almost
absolutely
tight
beam
of
very
small
diameter
and
since
we
know
that
that
one
hexan
vessel
at
least
had
no
apparatus
sufficiently
sensitive
to
detect
a
beam
of
that
nature
we
will
therefore
now
get
in
touch
with
the
callistonians
and
with
our
own
people
brandon
seated
himself
before
the
communicator
screen
and
while
the
others
packed
themselves
closely
around
his
stool
he
snapped
on
the
visiray
and
turned
the
dials
which
directed
that
invisible
immensely
complex
beam
through
space
the
screen
was
apparently
in
itself
a
coign
of
vantage
flying
through
space
with
the
velocity
of
light
and
the
watchers
gasped
involuntarily
and
drew
themselves
together
as
with
that
unthinkable
speed
they
flashed
down
toward
the
surface
of
callisto
so
realistic
was
the
impression
that
they
themselves
were
hurtling
through
the
void
that
they
could
scarcely
reason
themselves
into
believing
their
positive
knowledge
that
the
impending
collision
was
not
an
actual
happening
reducing
the
velocity
of
the
projection
abruptly
as
it
approached
the
satellite
brandon
flashed
it
down
into
a
crater
indicated
by
czuv
and
along
a
tunnel
to
the
city
of
zbardk
where
the
callistonian
captain
held
a
long
conversation
with
the
council
of
the
nation
frowning
in
thought
he
turned
to
newton
and
spoke
seriously
and
slowly
immediately
after
the
loss
of
our
with
the
supposed
death
of
king
breckenridge
and
myself
the
other
tellurian
officers
were
returned
to
europa
since
even
they
could
be
of
no
assistance
to
us
callistonians
in
our
struggle
against
the
new
vessels
of
the
hexans
the
present
situation
is
much
more
serious
than
i
would
have
believed
possible
the
last
vessel
going
to
visit
wruszk
our
city
upon
europa
was
caught
and
destroyed
by
the
hexans
and
for
many
weeks
no
ship
or
message
has
come
from
there
to
callisto
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
hexan
fleet
is
smaller
than
ever
before
they
are
guarding
europa
very
closely
it
is
feared
that
they
may
have
found
and
destroyed
our
city
there
an
expedition
is
even
now
about
to
set
out
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
learn
the
fate
of
our
fellows
suppose
the
rays
of
the
lifeboats
were
detected
in
landing
asked
brandon
that
might
have
given
them
a
clue
possibly
but
it
is
equally
possible
that
our
own
men
became
careless
in
the
operation
of
one
of
our
own
vessels
having
been
unmolested
so
long
they
might
have
relaxed
their
vigilance
we
may
never
know
tell
to
cancel
the
expedition
we
shoot
the
visiray
over
there
right
now
and
find
out
all
about
it
we
let
them
know
pretty
quickly
also
you
might
tell
them
that
you
got
complete
plans
and
specifications
for
all
the
weapons
that
the
hexans
have
and
a
couple
besides
and
that
the
quicker
they
shoot
a
ship
out
here
after
you
the
sooner
they
can
get
to
building
some
stuff
to
blow
those
hexans
clear
out
of
space
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
few
moments
to
drive
the
visiray
projection
to
europa
where
czuv
to
the
great
relief
of
all
found
that
the
hexans
had
not
yet
discovered
either
wruszk
or
the
terrestrial
workings
all
europan
humanity
fully
aware
of
the
hexan
investment
was
exerting
every
possible
precaution
against
discovery
by
the
enemy
this
information
was
duly
flashed
to
the
council
of
callisto
and
the
projection
was
then
hurled
across
the
intervening
reaches
of
space
and
into
the
cavern
in
which
was
being
built
the
enormous
in
which
the
terrestrial
refugees
were
to
attempt
the
long
voyage
back
to
their
own
distant
planet
it
took
some
little
time
to
convince
doctor
penfield
that
there
had
been
projected
into
the
empty
air
of
his
little
sanctum
an
absolutely
invisible
and
impalpable
structure
of
pure
force
capable
of
receiving
and
transmitting
voice
and
vision
once
convinced
of
the
reality
of
the
phenomenon
however
the
speaker
beside
brandon
communicator
screen
fairly
rattled
under
the
fervor
of
his
greeting
so
great
was
his
pleasure
at
the
arrival
of
the
expedition
of
relief
and
in
knowing
that
king
and
breckenridge
whom
they
had
of
course
given
up
for
dead
were
aboard
the
interplanetary
vessel
penfield
reported
that
the
work
upon
the
great
was
progressing
satisfactorily
although
slowly
since
it
was
so
much
larger
than
any
vessel
theretofore
constructed
by
the
callistonians
newton
in
turn
informed
the
autocrat
of
the
stranded
terrestrials
as
to
the
of
the
rescuing
party
of
course
because
of
the
hexan
blockade
you
can
not
take
us
off
until
they
have
been
wiped
out
which
will
be
several
months
at
best
the
surgeon
said
slowly
and
a
shadow
came
over
his
face
as
he
spoke
well
what
ca
be
cured
trouble
with
the
personnel
king
broke
in
sharply
personnel
yes
but
not
trouble
in
the
sense
you
mean
we
have
had
none
of
that
it
is
only
that
there
are
four
more
of
us
now
than
there
were
huh
how
come
demanded
brandon
in
astonishment
four
babies
have
been
born
to
us
here
so
far
and
several
more
are
coming
they
are
the
ones
i
worried
about
most
normal
adults
can
stand
it
here
without
any
serious
effects
but
this
thin
atmosphere
and
weak
gravity
are
certain
to
result
in
abnormal
development
of
children
however
there
may
be
another
way
out
of
it
are
you
using
normal
acceleration
or
have
you
martians
aboard
both
replied
brandon
we
are
carrying
two
inhabitants
of
mars
but
alcantro
and
fedanzo
are
not
ordinary
martians
they
have
been
in
constant
training
ever
since
we
left
tellus
and
now
they
can
stand
as
high
an
acceleration
as
a
weak
tellurian
we
riding
at
normal
good
as
you
already
know
there
has
been
no
communication
of
late
between
here
and
callisto
it
had
already
been
decided
however
that
one
more
voyage
must
be
risked
in
order
to
bring
back
material
which
is
most
urgently
needed
since
the
vessel
will
leave
here
light
and
is
large
enough
to
carry
about
thirty
passengers
on
a
short
trip
with
some
crowding
the
council
will
probably
approve
of
having
it
carry
some
of
our
passengers
out
to
the
especially
now
since
a
vessel
must
visit
you
anyway
to
get
captain
czuv
and
the
specifications
of
the
new
armament
all
these
things
can
be
done
with
one
vessel
in
one
trip
that
sounds
fine
boomed
king
it
will
give
me
a
chance
to
get
back
there
where
i
belong
too
whom
are
you
sending
out
the
seven
couples
who
either
have
babies
already
or
who
will
have
them
in
the
next
few
months
and
some
of
our
young
who
are
standing
the
gaff
any
too
well
you
wo
be
in
the
red
very
deeply
on
the
deal
either
while
two
or
three
of
the
passengers
i
am
sending
you
will
certainly
be
a
nuisance
anybody
could
use
anywhere
such
men
as
commander
sanderson
and
lieut
sanderson
interrupted
king
why
he
was
when
did
get
married
the
day
after
we
arrived
here
replied
the
surgeon
his
fiancee
was
aboard
the
and
when
they
found
out
how
long
we
would
have
to
be
here
they
very
sensibly
decided
not
to
wait
were
there
any
others
demanded
nadia
who
standing
between
stevens
and
her
father
had
been
an
interested
listener
plenty
of
them
fourteen
of
our
young
women
passengers
have
married
here
upon
europa
a
few
married
but
most
of
them
picked
out
officers
of
the
you
find
your
staff
made
up
pretty
largely
of
benedicts
now
king
we
been
here
a
year
you
know
and
time
will
tell
young
commander
sanderson
a
fine
baby
he
be
a
credit
to
the
ipc
some
day
if
we
can
get
him
aboard
the
where
he
can
get
a
good
start
we
could
give
our
babies
normal
air
pressure
here
by
building
special
rooms
but
we
can
not
give
them
the
normal
acceleration
necessary
to
develop
their
muscles
properly
well
we
better
snap
over
to
callisto
and
take
this
up
with
the
council
brandon
put
in
i
do
imagine
that
there
will
be
any
objections
so
you
might
as
well
get
your
ship
gassed
up
and
loaded
we
be
back
here
with
the
okay
in
about
a
minute
and
a
half
with
brandon
at
the
controls
and
with
czuv
at
the
communicator
plate
the
projection
flashed
toward
distant
callisto
and
the
group
melted
away
each
man
going
about
his
interrupted
task
daddy
take
us
somewhere
i
want
to
talk
to
you
nadia
spoke
to
her
father
and
the
director
led
her
and
stevens
to
his
own
room
all
x
daughter
out
with
it
and
he
bent
upon
her
a
quizzical
glance
under
which
a
fiery
blush
burned
from
her
throat
to
her
forehead
dad
i
been
thinking
a
lot
since
you
rescued
us
and
what
we
just
heard
has
given
me
the
nerve
to
say
it
steve
of
course
would
dare
suggest
such
a
thing
until
we
safely
back
on
earth
so
i
will
her
deep
brown
eyes
held
his
steadily
all
those
girls
got
married
why
some
of
them
have
babies
already
and
steve
and
i
have
waited
for
each
other
long
daddy
and
of
them
love
each
other
the
way
we
do
do
they
steve
i
do
see
how
they
could
sir
and
that
goes
straight
across
the
panel
and
he
bore
unflinchingly
the
piercing
gaze
of
the
older
man
as
his
right
arm
encircled
the
girl
and
held
her
close
well
why
not
a
sudden
smile
transformed
newton
stern
visage
there
are
three
chaplains
with
the
police
a
methodist
minister
a
catholic
priest
and
a
jewish
rabbi
also
we
have
on
board
two
captains
either
of
whom
is
authorized
to
tie
matrimonial
knots
the
means
are
not
lacking
if
you
both
sure
of
yourselves
and
all
levity
disappeared
as
he
studied
the
two
young
faces
yes
you
are
sure
he
continued
after
a
moment
just
as
her
mother
and
i
were
and
are
it
is
too
bad
that
she
can
not
be
here
with
you
but
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
we
can
return
to
tellus
and
you
have
indeed
waited
long
oh
thanks
daddy
you
just
a
perfectly
wonderful
old
darling
nadia
exclaimed
as
she
threw
her
arms
rapturously
around
his
neck
and
this
is
a
warship
at
all
you
know
perfectly
well
that
it
a
research
laboratory
and
that
as
soon
as
the
navy
gets
here
you
wo
let
it
fight
a
bit
more
because
such
scientists
ca
be
allowed
to
risk
themselves
and
also
you
forgetting
that
whole
flock
of
women
and
babies
that
are
coming
out
here
just
as
fast
as
they
can
get
themselves
ready
so
get
going
daddy
old
dear
and
let
do
things
steve
a
quaker
and
we
presbyterians
so
none
of
the
chaplains
will
do
at
all
besides
i
promised
captain
king
ages
ago
that
he
could
marry
me
so
go
get
him
and
we
do
it
now
bill
can
be
my
bridesmaid
you
give
me
away
and
steve
can
have
the
other
two
of
his
big
three
for
best
men
i
off
to
hunt
up
the
flimsiest
fussiest
white
dress
i
can
find
in
my
trunks
let
go
mr
newton
stevens
spoke
thoughtfully
as
nadia
darted
away
you
said
something
about
her
mother
i
did
want
to
say
anything
to
raise
false
hopes
while
she
was
here
but
i
got
an
idea
let
meet
in
room
instead
of
here
we
can
send
code
to
tellus
easily
enough
on
our
ultrawave
and
we
may
be
able
to
fake
up
something
on
vision
a
few
minutes
later
the
big
three
were
in
brandon
private
study
staring
intently
into
a
screen
of
ground
glass
upon
which
played
flickering
flashing
lights
while
the
physicist
manipulated
micrometer
dials
in
infinitesimal
arcs
once
more
mac
brandon
directed
pretty
nearly
had
them
that
time
we
stretching
this
projector
about
six
hundred
percent
but
we
got
to
make
this
connection
ca
you
give
me
just
a
little
more
voltage
on
those
secondaries
i
can
the
voice
of
the
first
assistant
snapped
from
the
speaker
i
overloading
now
so
badly
that
some
of
my

are
getting
hot
if
i
hold
this

much
longer

is
going
out
all

on

all
x
flashing
and
waning
the
lights
upon
the
screen
formed
fleeting
shifting
nebulous
images
of
a
relay
station
upon
distant
earth
but
the
utmost
power
of
the
transmitting
fields
could
neither
steady
the
image
nor
hold
it
back
off
mac
brandon
instructed
i
afraid
we
ca
hold

no
use
blowing
a

of

we
try
relaying
through

we
can
hold
them
there
i
think
it
will
muss
up

some
but
it
will
probably
be
better
than

was
finally
raised
and
held
and
a
corps
of
keenly
interested
engineers
there
made
short
work
of
the
linkage
soon
the
screen
glowed
with
the
picture
of
the
of

while
the
three

were
waiting
for

to
be
called
to

set
the
door
behind
them
opened
nadia
and
her
escorts
entered
the

but
stevens
eyes
saw
only
the
entrancing
vision
of
loveliness
that
was
his
bride
dressed
in
a
clinging
white
gown
of
shimmering
silk
her

a
golden
blond

came
to

you
never

unheeding

they
went
into

in
a
coalescence
as
inevitable
and
as
final
as

itself
hi
nadia
old
dear
and
daughter
from
what
i
can
see
of

came
together
from
the

nadia
tore
herself
from

embrace
to
see
upon
the
lambent
screen
the
happily
smiling
faces
of
her
mother
and
sister
mother
claire
oh
you
three
she
addressed
simultaneously
the
distant
terrestrials
and
the
scientists
at

side
while
broken
exclamations
punctuated
by
ominous
crackling
snaps
came
from
the

broke
in

you
have
to
hurry
it
up
alcantro
and

are
doing
their

every

in

red
hot
and
you

captain

opened
his

in

small

unadorned
save
for

upon

of

the
brief
but
solemn
ceremony
joining
two
young
lives
was
read
its
solemnity
only
intensified
by
its
unique
accompaniment
for
from

at
the
primary

through
the
of

and
the
upon

to
the
immense
interplanetary
transmitter

might
be
present
at

i
pronounce
you
man
and
wife
whom
god
hath
joined
let
no
man
put
asunder
the
sacred
old
ritual
ended
and
captain
king
picked
up
the
bride
in
his
great
arms
as
though
she
were
a
baby
kissed
her
vigorously
and
set
her
down
in
front
of
the
transmitter
in
the
midst
of
the
joyous
confusion
that
ensued
a
tearing
rattling
crash
came
from
the
speaker
and
the
screen
went
blank
there
lamented
macdonald
from
the
power
room
i
knew
they
blow
there
goes
my
whole
secondary
bank
eight
perfectly
good
all
shot
to
that
too
bad
but
it
could
be
helped
they
went
for
a
good
cause
interrupted
brandon
i
come
down
and
help
clean
up
the
mess
leaving
the
bridal
party
he
made
his
way
rapidly
to
the
power
room
where
he
found
macdonald
and
the
two
martians
inspecting
the
smoking
remains
of
what
had
been
the
secondary
bank
of
their
powerful
spare
parts
in
abundance
were
on
hand
and
it
was
not
long
until
the
damaged
section
was
apparently
as
good
as
new
now
to
try
her
out
brandon
announced
we
want
to
give
her
a
good
workout
but
there
no
use
trying
the
stations
any
more
altogether
too
hard
to
handle
at
this
range
czuv
said
something
about
an
unknown
race
of
monstrosities
at
the
south
pole
of
jupiter
let
try
it
on
them
for
a
while
he
flung
the
field
of
force
out
into
space
as
responsive
to
his
will
as
a
horse
and
guided
it
toward
the
southern
limb
of
that
gigantic
world
down
and
down
the
projection
plunged
through
mile
after
mile
of
reeking
steaming
fog
impenetrable
to
earthly
eyes
finally
it
came
to
rest
upon
the
surface
hundreds
of
feet
deep
in
a
lush
dank
tropical
jungle
and
brandon
plugged
into
the
venerian
room
kenor
we
got
a
lot
of
use
for
you
if
you
can
come
down
here
for
a
while
thanks
a
lot
he
turned
to
the
martians
luckily
we
got
a
couple
of
transformers
aboard
so
we
wo
have
to
build
one
you
fellows
might
break
one
out
and
shunt
it
onto
this
circuit
while
dol
kenor
is
hunting
up
something
for
us
to
look
at
hi
old
he
went
on
as
the
venerian
scientist
waddled
into
the
room
in
his
bulging
we
got
something
here
right
down
your
alley
want
to
see
what
you
can
see
ah
a
beautiful
scene
exclaimed
dol
kenor
after
one
glance
into
the
plate
it
is
indeed
a
relief
after
all
this
coldness
and
glare
to
see
such
a
soft
warm
landscape
even
though
i
have
never
expected
to
behold
quite
such
a
violent
bit
of
jungle
and
under
his
guidance
the
projection
flashed
over
hundreds
of
miles
of
territory
to
the
eyes
of
the
terrestrials
the
screen
revealed
only
a
blank
amorphous
grayness
through
which
at
times
there
shot
lines
and
masses
of
vague
and
meaningless
form
but
the
venerian
was
very
evidently
seeing
and
enjoying
many
and
diverse
scenes
there
i
think
is
what
you
wish
to
see
first
he
announced
as
he
finally
steadied
the
controls
and
brandon
cut
in
upon
the
shunting
screen
the
transformer
this
device
developed
long
before
to
render
possible
the
use
of
terrestrial
eyes
in
the
opaque
atmosphere
of
venus
stepped
up
the
long
waves
into
the
frequencies
of
light
capable
of
affecting
the
earthly
retina
instantly
the
dull
gray
blank
of
the
shunting
screen
became
transformed
into
a
clear
and
colorful
picture
of
the
great
city
of
the
jovians
of
the
south
great
cat
brandon
exclaimed
flying
fortresses
is
right
they
in
war
formation
too
or
i
a

we
got
to
watch
this
mac
all
of
it
and
watch
it
close
it
apt
to
have
a
big
bearing
on
what
have
to
do
before
they
get
done
better
we
rig
up
another
set
and
put
a
relay
of
observers
on
this
job
chapter
xi
the

vorkulia
the
city
of
the
vorkuls
was
an
immense
star
at
its
center
directly
upon
the
south
pole
of
jupiter
rose
a
tremendous
shaft
its
likewise
a
tapering
star
which
housed
the
directing
intelligence
of
the
nation
radiating
from
the
seven
cardinal
points
of
the

were
short
lanes
leading
to
open
plots
from
which
in
turn
branched
out
ways
to
other
stellate
areas
ways
reaching
after
many
such
steps
to
the
towering
inner
walls
of
the
metropolis
the
outer
walls
still
loftier
and
even
more
massive
ramparts
of
sullen
metal
formed
a
seamless
jointless
barrier
against
an
utterly
indescribable
foe
a
barrier
whose
outer
faces
radiated
constantly
a
searing
coruscating
green
emanation
metal
alone
could
not
long
have
barred
that
voracious
and
implacably
relentless
enemy
but
against
that
lethal
green
emanation
even
that
ravening
jovian
jungle
could
not
prevail
but
fell
back
impotent
writhing
and
crawling
loathesomely
palpitant
with
an
unspeakable
exuberance
of
foul
and
repellent
vigor
possible
only
to
such
meteorological
conditions
as
obtained
there
it
threw
its
most
hideously
prolific
growths
against
that
radiant
wall
in

the
short
lanes
the
ways
and
the
areas
were
paved
with
a
greenish
glass
this
pavement
was
intended
solely
to
prevent
vegetable
growth
and
carried
no
traffic
whatever
since
few
indeed
of
the
vorkuls
have
ever
been
and
all
traffic
was
in
the
air
the
principal
purpose
of
the
openings
was
to
separate
and
thus
to
render
accessible
by
air
the
mighty
buildings
which
level
upon

towered
upward
with
airships
hovering
at

anchored
to

between

forbidding

of

no

living
was
to
be
seen
in
that
space
its

was
of
solid
metal
and
immensely
thick
and
that
metal
as
well
as
that
of

was
burned
and
blackened
and

his

folded
his

coiled
comfortably
in
slack

about

at

in

a

the

tightened
as
he
reared
a
few
feet
of
his

upright
shooting
out
half
a

tentacular

to
various
switches

upon

while
throughout

hundreds
of

to

at

howling

there

the
reason
for
the
burns
and
scars
in
the
tortured
space
between
the
lofty
inner
and

of

for
these
heptagons
were
the
monstrous
flying
fortresses
which
czuv
had
occasionally
seen
from
afar
as
they
went
upon
some
unusual
errand
above
the
jovian

brandon
was
soon
to
see
in
his
visiray
screen
the
seared
and
disfigured
metal
of
the
pavement
and

was
made
so
by
the
release
of
the
furious
blasts
of
energy
necessary
to
raise
those
untold
thousands
of

of
mass
against
the
attraction

more
than

it
dashed
back
and
forth
upon
the
heavy
metal
between
the
walls
as
more
and
more
of
the
inconceivable
power
of
those
titanic
generators
was
unleashed
it
boiled
forth
in
a
devastating
flood
which
striking
the
walls
rebounded
and
leaped
vertically
far
above
even
those
mighty
ramparts
even
the
enormous
thickness
of
the
highly
conducting
metal
could
not
absorb
all
the
energy
of
that
intolerable
blast
and
immediately
beneath
the
ports
new
areas
of
disfigurement
appeared
as
those
terrific
flying
fortresses
were
finally
wrenched
from
the
ground
and
hurled
upward
high
in
the
air
another
signal
wailed
up
and
down
a
peculiar
scale
of
sound
and
the
mighty
host
of
vessels
formed
smoothly
into
symmetrical
groups
of
seven
each
group
then
moved
with
mathematical
precision
into
its
allotted
position
in
a
complex
geometrical
formation
a
gigantic
duplex
cone
in
space
the
flagship
flew
at
the
apex
of
this
stupendous
formation
behind
and
protected
by
the
full
power
of
the
other
floating
citadels
of
the
groups
of
seven
due
north
the
amazing
armada
sped
in
rigorous
alignment
flying
along
a
predetermined
meridian
due
north
at
the
end
of
his
watch
kromodeor
relinquished
his
board
to
the
officer
relieving
him
and
shot
into
the
air
propelled
by
the
straightening
of
the
powerful
coils
of
his
body
and
tail
wings
half
spread
lateral
and
vertical
ruddering
fins
outthrust
he
soared
across
the
room
toward
a
low
opening
just
before
they
struck
the
wall
upon
either
side
of
the
doorway
the
great
wings
snapped
shut
the
fins
retracted
and
the
long
and
heavy
body
struck
the
floor
of
the
passage
without
a
jar
with
a
wriggling
serpentine
motion
he
sped
like
a
vibrant
arrow
along
the
hall
and
into
a
wardroom
there
after
a
brief
glance
around
the
room
he
coiled
up
beside
a
fellow
officer
who
with
one
eye
was
negligently
reading
a
scroll
held
in
three
or
four
hands
while
with
another
eye
poised
upon
its
slender
pedicle
he
watched
a
moving
picture
upon
a
television
screen
hello
kromodeor
wixill
chief
power
officer
greeted
the
newcomer
in
the
wailing
hissing
language
of
the
vorkuls
he
tossed
the
scroll
into
the
air
where
it
instantly
rolled
into
a
tight
cylinder
and
shot
into
an
opening
in
the
wall
of
the
room
glad
to
see
you
books
and
shows
are
all
right

all

kromodeor
elevated
an
eye
and
studied
the
screen
upon
which
to
the
accompaniment
of
whistling
shrieking
sound
whirled
and
gyrated
an
interlacing
group
of
serpentine
forms
a
good
show
wixill
the
projector
officer
replied
but
nothing
to
hold
the
attention
of
men
engaged
in
what
we
are
doing
think
of
it
after
twenty
years
of
preparation
two
long
lifetimes
and
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
we
are
actually
going
to
war
i
have
thought
of
it
at
length
it
is
disgusting
compelled
to
traffic
with
an
alien
form
of
life
were
it
not
to
end
in
the
extinction
of
those
unspeakable
hexans
it
would
be
futile
to
the
point
of
silliness
i
can
not
understand
them
at
all
there
is
ample
room
upon
this
planet
for
all
of
us
our
races
combined
are
not
using
one
of
its
surface
you
would
think
that
they
would
shun
all
strangers
yet
for
ages
have
they
attacked
us
refusing
to
let
us
alone
until
finally
they
forced
us
to
prepare
means
for
their
destruction
they
seem
as
senselessly
savage
as
the
jungle
growths
and
but
for
their
very
evident
intelligence
one
would
class
them
as
such
you
would
think
that
being
intelligent
and
being
alien
to
us
they
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
us
in
any
way
peacefully
or
otherwise
however
their
intrusions
and
depredations
are
about
to
end
they
certainly
are
vorkulia
has
endured
much
too
much
but
i
am
glad
that
our
forefathers
did
not
decide
to
exterminate
them
sooner
if
they
had
we
could
not
have
been
doing
this
now
there
speaks
the
rashness
of
youth
kromodeor
it
is
a
violation
of
all
our
instincts
to
have
any
commerce
with
outsiders
as
you
will
learn
as
soon
as
you
see
one
of
them
then
too
we
will
lose
heavily
since
we
have
studied
their
armaments
so
long
and
have
subjected
every
phase
of
the
situation
to
statistical
analysis
it
is
certain
that
we
are
to
succeed
but
you
also
know
at
what
cost
of
our
force
with
a
probable
error
of
one
in
seven
replied
the
younger
vorkul
and
because
that
figure
can
not
be
improved
within
the
next
seven
years
and
because
of
the
exceptional
weakness
of
the
hexans
due
to
their
unexpectedly
great
losses
upon
callisto
we
are
attacking
at
this
time
their
spherical
vessels
are
nothing
of
course
it
is
in
the
reduction
of
the
city
that
we
will
lose
men
and
vessels
but
at
that
each
of
us
has
five
chances
in
seven
of
returning
which
is
good
enough
odds
much
better
than
we
had
in
that
last
expedition
into
the
jungle
but
by
the
mighty
seven
i
shall
make
myself
wrap
around
one
hexan
for
my
brother
sake
and
his
coils
tightened
unconsciously
hideous
repulsive
monstrosities
creatures
so
horrible
should
not
be
allowed
to
live
they
should
have
been
tossed
over
the
wall
to
the
jungle
ages
ago
kromodeor
curled
out
an
eye
as
he
spoke
and
complacently
surveyed
the
writhing
cylinder
of
sinuous
supple
power
that
was
his
own
body
better
avoid
contact
work
with
them
if
possible
cautioned
wixill
you
might
not
be
able
to
unwrap
and
to
touch
one
of
them
is
almost
unthinkable
speaking
of
wrapping
you
know
that
they
are
putting
on
the
finals
of
the
contact
work
in
the
star
this
evening
let
watch
them
they
slid
to
the
floor
and
wriggled
away
in
perfect
step
undulating
along
in
such
nice
synchronism
that
their
adjacent
sides
only
a
few
inches
apart
formed
two
waving
rigidly
parallel
lines
deep
in
the
lower
part
of
the
fortress
they
entered
a
large
assembly
room
provided
with
a
raised
platform
in
the
center
and
having
hundreds
of
short
upright
posts
in
lieu
of
chairs
most
of
which
were
already
taken
by
spectators
the
two
officers
curled
their
tails
comfortably
around
two
of
the
vacant
pillars
elevated
their
heads
to
a
convenient
level
of
sight
and
directed
each
an
eye
or
two
upon
the
stage
this
was
of
course
heptagonal
its
sides
like
those
of
the
mighty
flying
forts
themselves
were
not
straight
but
angled
inward
sufficiently
to
make
the
platform
a
star
the
edge
was
outlined
by
a
low
rail
and
bulwark
and
floor
were
padded
with
thick
layers
of
a
hard
but
smooth
and
yielding
fabric
in
this
ring
two
young
vorkuls
were
contending
for
the
championship
of
the
fleet
in
a
contest
that
seemed
to
combine
most
of
the
features
of
wrestling
boxing
and
brawling
with
no
holds
barred
four
hands
of
each
of
the
creatures
held
heavy
leather
billies
and
could
be
used
only
in
striking
with
those
weapons
the
remaining
hands
being
left
free
to
employ
as
the
owner
saw
fit
since
the
sport
was
not
intended
to
be
lethal
however
the
eyes
and
other
highly
vulnerable
parts
were
protected
by
metal
masks
and
the
wing
ribs
were
similarly
guarded
by
leathern
shields
the
guiding
fins
being
comparatively
small
and
extremely
tough
required
no
protection
we
just
in
time
kromodeor
whistled
the
main
bout
is
nicely
on
see
anyone
from
the
flagship
i
might
stake
a
couple
of
korpels
that
sintris
will
paint
the
symbol
upon
his
wing
most
of
their
men
seem
to
be
across
the
star
wixill
replied
and
both
beings
fell
silent
absorbed
in
the
struggle
going
on
in
the
ring
it
was
a
contest
well
worth
watching
wing
crashed
against
mighty
wing
and
the
lithe
hard
bodies
snapped
and
curled
this
way
and
that
almost
faster
than
the
eye
could
follow
in
quest
of
advantageous
holds
above
the
shrieking
wails
of
the
crowd
could
be
heard
the
smacks
and
thuds
of
the
eight
flying
clubs
as
they
struck
against
the
leather
shields
or
against
tough
and
scaly
hides
for
minutes
the
conflict
raged
with
no
advantage
apparent
now
the
fighters
were
flat
upon
the
floor
of
the
star
now
dozens
of
feet
in
the
air
above
it
as
one
or
the
other
sought
to
gain
a
height
from
which
to
plunge
downward
upon
his
opponent
but
both
stayed
upon
or
over
the
star
to
leave
its
boundaries
was
to
lose
disgracefully
then
high
in
air
the
visiting
warrior
thought
that
he
saw
an
opening
and
grappled
wings
crashed
in
fierce
blows
hands
gripped
and
furiously
wrenched
two
powerful
bodies
tapering
smoothly
down
to
equally
powerful
tails
corkscrewed
around
each
other
viciously
winding
up
into
something
resembling
tightly
twisted
lamp
cord
and
the
two
vorkuls
each
helpless
fell
to
the
mat
with
a
crash
fast
as
was
zerexi
the
gladiator
from
the
flagship
sintris
was
the
merest
trifle
faster
like
the
straightening
of
a
twisted
spring
of
tempered
steel
that
long
body
uncoiled
as
they
struck
the
floor
and
up
under
those
shielding
wings
an
infinitesimal
fraction
of
a
second
slow
in
interposing
that
lithe
tail
sped
two
lightning
loops
flashed
around
the
neck
of
the
visitor
and
tightened
inexorably
desperately
the
victim
fought
to
break
that
terrible
strangle
hold
but
every
maneuver
was
countered
as
soon
as
it
was
begun
beating
wings
under
whose
frightful
blows
the
very
air
quivered
were
met
and
parried
by
wings
equally
capable
hands
and
clubs
were
of
no
avail
against
that
corded
cable
of
sinew
and
sintris
his
head
retracted
between
his
wings
and
his
own
hands
reenforcing
that
impregnable
covering
over
his
head
and
neck
threw
all
his
power
into
his
tail
tightening
with
terrific
rippling
surges
that
already
throttling
band
about
the
throat
of
his
opponent
only
one
result
was
possible
soon
zerexi
lay
quiet
and
a
violet
beam
of
light
flared
from
a
torch
at
the
ringside
bathing
both
contenders
at
the
flash
the
winner
disengaged
himself
from
the
loser
and
stood
by
until
the
latter
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
paralyzed
muscles
the
two
combatants
then
touched
wing
tips
in
salute
and
flew
away
together
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
plunging
into
a
doorway
and
disappearing
as
the
two
officers
uncoiled
from
their
seats
and
wriggled
out
into
the
corridor
fine
piece
of
contact
work
said
wixill
thoughtfully
i
glad
that
sintris
won
but
i
did
not
expect
him
to
win
so
easily
zerexi
have
gone
into
a
knot
so
early
against
such
a
fast
man
oh
i
do
know
argued
kromodeor
his
big
mistake
was
in
that
second
body
check
if
he
had
blocked
the
sixth
arm
with
his
fifth
taken
out
the
fourth
and
second
with
his
third
and
then
gone
in
with
and
so
quite
like
two
early
experts
after
a
good
boxing
match
the
friends
argued
the
fine
points
of
the
contest
long
after
they
had
reached
their
quarters
day
after
day
the
vast
duplex
cone
of
vorkulian
fortresses
sped
toward
the
north
pole
of
the
great
planet
with
a
high
and
constant
velocity
day
after
day
the
complex
geometrical
figure
in
space
remained
unchanged
no
unit
deviating
measurably
from
its
precise
place
in
the
formation
over
rapacious
jungles
over
geysers
spouting
hot
water
over
sullenly
steaming
rivers
and
seas
over
boiling
lakes
of
mud
and
high
over
gigantic
volcanoes
in
uninterrupted
eruptions
of
cataclysmic
violence
the
vorkulian
phalanx
flew
straight
north
the
equatorial
regions
considerably
hotter
than
the
poles
were
traversed
with
practically
no
change
in
scenery
it
was
a
world
of
steaming
fog
of
jungle
of
hot
water
of
boiling
spurting
mud
and
of
volcanoes
not
of
such
mild
and
sporadic
volcanic
outbreaks
as
we
of
green
terra
know
but
of
gigantic
primordial
volcanoes
in
terrifyingly
continuous
performances
of
frightful
intensity
due
north
the
vorkulian
spearhead
was
hurled
before
the
rigorous
geometrical
alignment
was
altered
all
captains
attention
finally
in
a
high
latitude
the
flagship
sent
out
final
instructions
the
hexans
have
detected
us
and
our
long
range
observers
report
that
they
are
coming
to
meet
us
in
force
we
will
now
go
into
the
whirl
and
proceed
with
the
maneuvers
exactly
as
they
have
been
planned
whirl
at
the
command
each
vessel
began
to
pursue
a
tortuous
spiral
path
each
group
of
seven
circled
slowly
about
its
own
axis
as
though
each
structure
were
attached
rigidly
to
a
radius
rod
and
at
the
same
time
spiraled
around
the
line
of
advance
in
such
fashion
that
the
whole
gigantic
cone
wide
open
maw
to
the
fore
seemed
to
be
boring
its
way
through
the
air
lucky
again
kromodeor
in
the
wardroom
turned
to
wixill
as
the
two
prepared
to
take
their
respective
watches
it
looks
as
though
the
first
action
would
come
while
we
on
duty
i
got
just
one
favor
to
ask
if
you
have
to
economize
on
power
let
number
one
alone
will
you
no
fear
of
that
wixill
hissed
with
the
vorkulian
equivalent
of
a
chuckle
we
have
abundance
of
power
for
all
of
your
projector
officers
but
do
waste
any
of
it
or
i
cut
you
down
five
ratings
you
welcome
when
i
shine
old
number
one
on
any
hexan
work
one
flash
is
all
we
take
see
you
at
supper
and
leaving
his
superior
at
the
door
of
the
power
room
kromodeor
wriggled
away
to
his
station
upon
the
parallel
horizontal
bars
before
his
panel
making
sure
that
his
tail
coils
were
so
firmly
clamped
that
no
possible
lurch
or
shock
could
throw
him
out
of
position
he
set
an
eye
toward
each
of
his
sighting
screens
even
though
he
knew
that
it
would
be
long
before
those
comparatively
short
range
instruments
would
show
anything
except
friendly
vessels
then
ready
for
any
emergency
he
scanned
his
one
live
screen
the
one
upon
which
were
being
flashed
the
pictures
and
reports
secured
by
the
instruments
of
the
observers
with
the
terrific
acceleration
employed
by
the
hexan
spheres
it
was
not
long
until
the
leading
squadron
of
fighting
globes
neared
the
vorkulian
this
advance
guard
was
composed
of
the
new
vessels
their
crews
with
the
innate
and
savagery
of
their
breed
had
not
even
entertained
the
thought
of
accommodating
their
swifter
pace
to
that
of
the
main
body
of
the
fleet
these
vast
structures
were
no
more
to
be
feared
than
those
similar
ones
whose
visits
they
had
been
repulsing
for
twenty
long
jovian
years
by
the
time
the
slower
spheres
could
arrive
upon
the
scene
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
them
to
do
therefore
few
in
number
as
were
the
vessels
of
the
vanguard
they
rushed
to
the
attack
in
one
blinding
salvo
they
launched
their
supposedly
irresistible
planes
of
force
dazzling
scintillating
planes
under
whose
fierce
power
the
studying
questing
scouting
fortresses
previously
encountered
had
fled
back
southward
cut
beaten
and
crippled
these
spiraling
monsters
however
did
not
pause
or
waver
in
their
stolidly
ordered
motion
as
the
hexan
planes
of
force
flashed
out
the
dull
green
metal
walls
broke
into
a
sparkling
green
radiance
against
which
the
titanic
bolts
spent
themselves
in
vain
then
there
leaped
out
from
the
weird
brilliance
of
the
walls
of
the
fortresses
great
shafts
of
pale
green
luminescence
tractor
ray
after
gigantic
tractor
ray
which
seized
upon
the
hexan
spheres
and
drew
them
ruthlessly
into
the
yawning
open
end
of
that
gigantic
cone
then
in
each
group
of
seven
similar
great
streamers
of
energy
reached
out
from
fortress
to
fortress
until
each
group
was
welded
into
one
mighty
unit
by
such
bands
of
force
the
unit
formed
a
ray
from
each
of
its
seven
component
structures
seized
upon
a
designated
sphere
and
under
the
combined
power
of
those
seven
tractors
the
luckless
globe
was
literally
snapped
into
the
center
of
mass
of
the
vorkulian
unit
there
seven
dully
gleaming
red
pressor
rays
leaped
upon
it
backed
by
all
the
power
of
seven
gigantic
fortresses
held
rigidly
in
formation
by
the
unimaginable
mass
of
the
structures
and
by
their
prodigious
tractor
beams
under
that
awful
impact
the
screens
and
walls
of
the
hexan
spheres
were
exactly
as
effective
as
so
many
structures
of
the
most
tenuous
vapor
the
red
glare
of
the
vortex
of
those
beams
was
lightened
momentarily
by
a
flash
of
brighter
color
and
through
the
foggy
atmosphere
there
may
have
flamed
briefly
a
drop
or
two
of
metal
that
was
only
liquefied
the
red
and
green
beams
snapped
out
the
peculiar
radiance
died
from
the
metal
walls
and
the
gigantic
duplex
cone
of
the
vorkuls
bored
serenely
northward
as
little
marked
or
affected
by
the
episode
as
is
a
darting
swift
who
having
snapped
up
a
chance
insect
in
full
flight
darts
on
great
cat
far
off
in
space
brandon
turned
from
his
visiray
screen
and
wiped
his
brow
czuv
certainly
chirped
it
perce
when
he
called
those
things
flying
fortresses
but
who
what
why
and
how
we
see
any
apparatus
that
looked
capable
of
generating
or
handling
those
beams
and
of
course
when
they
got
started
their
screens
cut
us
off
at
the
pockets
wish
we
could
have
made
some
sense
out
of
their
language
like
to
know
a
few
of
their
ideas
find
out
whether
we
get
on
terms
with
them
some
way
or
other
wampuses
but
they
got
real
brains
their
are
very
evidently
full
of
bubbles
if
they
have
it
in
mind
to
take
us
on
next
old
son
it
be
just
too
bad
and
then
some
agreed
stevens
they
got
something
no
fooling
it
looks
like
the
hexans
are
going
to
get
theirs
good
and
plenty
pretty
soon
and
then
what
i
give
my
left
lung
and
four
front
teeth
for
one
long
look
at
their
controls
in
action
you
and
me
both
it
funny
the
way
those
green
stick
to
the
walls
instead
of
being
spherical
as
you
expect
should
think
they
to
radiate
from
a
center
and
so
be
spherical
brandon
cogitated
however
we
got
nothing
corkscrewy
enough
to
go
through
them
so
we
have
to
stand
by
we
stay
inside
whenever
possible
look
on
from
outside
when
we
must
but
all
the
time
picking
up
whatever
information
we
can
in
the
meantime
now
that
we
got
our
passengers
old
doctor
westfall
prescribes
something
that
he
says
is
good
for
what
ails
us
distance
lots
of
distance
straight
out
from
the
sun
and
i
would
wonder
if
we
better
take
his
prescription
the
two
terrestrial
observers
relapsed
into
silence
staring
into
their
visiray
plates
searching
throughout
the
enormous
volume
of
one
of
those
great
fortresses
in
another
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
generation
and
propagation
of
the
incredible
manifestations
of
energy
which
they
had
just
witnessed
scarcely
had
the
search
begun
however
when
the
visirays
were
again
cut
off
sharply
the
rapidly
advancing
main
fleet
of
the
hexans
had
arrived
and
the
scintillant
vorkulian
screens
were
again
in
place
true
to
hexan
nature
training
and
tradition
the
fleet
hundreds
strong
rushed
savagely
to
the
attack
above
below
and
around
the
cone
the
furious
globes
dashed
attacking
every
vorkulian
craft
viciously
with
every
resource
at
their
command
with
every
weapon
known
to
their
diabolically
destructive
race
planes
of
force
stabbed
and
slashed
concentrated
beams
of
annihilation
flared
fiercely
through
the
reeking
atmosphere
gigantic
aerial
bombs
and
torpedoes
were
hurled
with
full
radio
control
against
the
unwelcome
visitor
with
no
effect
bound
together
in
groups
of
seven
by
the
mighty
bands
of
force
the
vorkulian
units
sailed
calmly
northward
spiraling
along
with
not
the
slightest
change
in
formation
or
velocity
the
frightful
planes
and
beams
of
immeasurable
power
simply
spent
themselves
harmlessly
against
those
sparklingly
radiant
green
walls
seemingly
as
absorbent
to
energy
as
a
sponge
is
to
water
since
the
eye
could
not
detect
any
change
in
the
appearance
of
the
screens
under
even
the
fiercest
blasts
of
the
hexan
projectors
bombs
torpedoes
and
all
material
projectiles
were
equally
futile
they
exploded
harmlessly
in
the
air
far
from
their
objectives
or
disappeared
at
the
touch
of
one
of
those
dark
pressor
rays
and
swiftly
but
calmly
and
methodically
as
at
a
vorkulian
practice
drill
the
heptagons
were
destroying
the
hexan
fleet
seven
mighty
green
tractors
would
lash
out
seize
an
attacking
sphere
and
snap
it
into
the
center
of
mass
of
the
unit
of
seven
there
would
be
a
brief
flash
of
dull
red
a
still
briefer
flare
of
incandescence
and
the
impalpable
magnets
would
leap
out
to
seize
another
of
the
doomed
globes
it
was
only
a
matter
of
moments
until
not
a
hexan
vessel
remained
and
the
vorkulian
juggernaut
spiraled
onward
now
at
full
acceleration
toward
the
hexan
stronghold
dimly
visible
far
ahead
of
them
a
vast
city
built
around
jupiter
northern
pole
at
the
controls
of
his
projector
kromodeor
spun
a
dial
with
a
flexible
hand
and
spoke
wixill
i
am
being
watched
again
i
can
feel
very
plainly
that
strange
intelligence
watching
everything
i
do
have
the
tracers
located
him
no
they
have
been
able
to
synchronize
with
his
wave
yet
either
he
is
using
a
most
minute
pencil
or
what
is
more
probable
he
is
on
a
frequency
which
we
do
not
ordinarily
use
however
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
not
a
malignant
intelligence
all
of
us
have
felt
it
and
none
of
us
senses
enmity
therefore
it
is
not
a
hexan
it
may
be
one
of
those
strange
creatures
of
the
satellites
who
are
of
course
perfectly
harmless
harmless
but
unpleasant
returned
kromodeor
when
we
get
back
going
to
find
his
beam
myself
and
send
a
discharge
along
it
that
will
end
his
spying
upon
me
i
do
not
a
wailing
signal
interrupted
the
conversation
and
every
vorkul
in
the
vast
fleet
coiled
even
more
tightly
about
his
bars
for
the
real
battle
was
about
to
begin
the
city
of
the
hexans
lay
before
them
all
her
gigantic
forces
mustered
to
repel
the
first
real
invasion
of
her
long
and
warlike
history
mile
after
mile
it
extended
an
orderly
labyrinth
of
spherical
buildings
arranged
in
vast
interlocking
series
of
concentric
circles
a
city
of
such
size
that
only
a
small
part
of
it
was
visible
even
to
the
vision
of
the
vorkulians
apparently
the
city
was
unprotected
having
not
even
a
wall
outward
from
the
low
rounded
houses
of
the
city
edge
there
reached
a
wide
and
verdant
plain
which
was
separated
from
the
jungle
by
a
narrow
moat
of
shimmering
liquid
a
liquid
of
such
dire
potency
that
across
it
even
those
frightful
growths
could
neither
leap
nor
creep
but
as
the
vorkulian
phalanx
approached
now
shooting
forward
and
upward
with
maximum
acceleration
screaming
bolts
of
energy
flaming
out
for
miles
behind
each
heptagon
as
the
full
power
of
its
generators
was
unleashed
it
was
made
clear
that
the
homeland
of
the
hexans
was
far
from
unprotected
the
verdant
plain
disappeared
in
a
blast
of
radiance
revealing
a
transparent
surface
through
which
could
be
seen
masses
of
machinery
filling
level
below
level
deep
into
the
ground
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
from
the
bright
liquid
of
the
girdling
moat
there
shot
vertically
upward
a
coruscantly
refulgent
band
of
intense
yellow
luminescence
these
were
the
hexan
defences
heretofore
invulnerable
and
invincible
against
them
any
ordinary
warcraft
equipped
with
ordinary
weapons
of
offense
would
have
been
as
pitifully
impotent
as
a
naked
baby
attacking
a
battleship
but
now
those
defenses
were
being
challenged
by
no
ordinary
craft
it
had
taken
the
mightiest
intellects
of
vorkulia
two
long
lifetimes
to
evolve
the
awful
engine
of
destruction
which
was
hurling
itself
forward
and
upward
with
an
already
terrific
and
constantly
increasing
speed
onward
and
upward
flashed
the
gigantic
duplex
cone
its
entire
whirling
mass
laced
and
latticed
together
into
one
mammoth
unit
by
green
tractor
beams
and
red
pressors
these
tension
and
compression
members
of
power
made
of
the
whole
fleet
of
three
hundred
fortresses
a
single
stupendous
structure
a
structure
with
all
the
strength
and
symmetry
of
a
cantilever
truss
straight
through
that
wall
of
yellow
vibrations
the
vast
truss
drove
green
walls
flaming
blue
defiance
as
the
absorbers
overloaded
its
doubly
braced
tip
rearing
upward
into
and
beyond
the
vertical
as
it
shot
through
that
searing
yellow
wall
simultaneously
from
each
heptagon
there
flamed
downward
a
green
shaft
of
radiance
so
that
the
whole
immense
circle
of
the
mouth
was
one
solid
tractor
beam
fastening
upon
and
holding
in
an
unbreakable
grip
mile
upon
mile
of
the
hexan
earthworks
practically
irresistible
force
and
supposedly
immovable
object
every
loose
article
in
every
heptagon
had
long
since
been
stored
in
its
individual
shockproof
compartment
and
now
every
vorkul
coiled
his
entire
body
in
fierce
clasp
about
mighty
horizontal
bars
for
the
entire
kinetic
energy
of
the
untold
millions
of
tons
of
mass
comprising
the
cone
at
the
terrific
measure
of
its
highest
possible
velocity
was
to
be
hurled
upon
those
unbreakable
linkages
of
force
which
bound
the
trussed
aggregation
of
vorkulian
fortresses
to
the
deeply
buried
intrenchments
of
the
hexans
the
gigantic
composite
tractor
beam
snapped
on
and
held
inconceivably
powerful
as
that
beam
was
it
stretched
a
trifle
under
the
incomprehensible
momentum
of
those
prodigious
masses
of
metal
almost
halted
in
their
terrific
flight
but
the
was
not
quite
halted
the
calculations
of
the
vorkulian
scientists
had
been
accurate
no
possible
artificial
structure
and
but
few
natural
ones
in
practice
maneuvers
entire
mountains
had
been
lifted
and
hurled
for
miles
through
the
air
could
have
withstood
the
incredible
violence
of
that
lunging
twisting
upheaving
impact
lifted
bodily
by
that
impalpable
hawser
of
force
and
cruelly
wrenched
and
twisted
by
its
enormous
couple
of
angular
momentum
the
hexan
works
came
up
out
of
the
ground
as
a
waterpipe
comes
up
in
the
teeth
of
a
power
shovel
the
ground
trembled
and
rocked
and
boulders
fragments
of
concrete
masonry
and
masses
of
metal
flew
in
all
directions
as
that
conduit
of
diabolical
machinery
was
torn
from
its
bed
a
portion
of
that
conduit
fully
thirty
miles
in
length
was
in
the
air
a
twisted
flaming
inferno
of
wrecked
generators
exploding
ammunition
and
broken
and
leads
before
the
hexans
could
themselves
cut
it
and
thus
save
the
remainder
of
their
fortifications
with
resounding
crashes
the
structure
parted
at
the
weakened
points
the
furious
upheaval
stopped
and
the
tractor
beams
shut
off
the
shattered
smoking
erupting
mass
of
wreckage
fell
in
clashing
grinding
ruin
upon
the
city
the
enormous
duplex
cone
of
the
vorkuls
did
not
attempt
to
repeat
the
maneuver
but
divided
into
two
single
cones
one
of
which
darted
toward
each
point
of
rupture
there
upon
the
broken
and
unprotected
ends
of
the
hexan
cordon
their
points
of
attack
lay
theirs
the
task
to
eat
along
that
annular
fortress
no
matter
what
the
opposition
might
bring
to
bear
to
channel
in
its
place
a
furrow
of
devastation
until
the
two
cones
their
work
complete
should
meet
at
the
opposite
edge
of
the
city
then
what
was
left
of
the
cones
would
separate
into
individual
heptagons
which
would
so
systematically
blast
every
hexan
thing
into
nothingness
as
to
make
certain
that
never
again
would
they
resume
their
insensate
attacks
upon
the
vorkuls
having
counted
the
cost
and
being
grimly
ready
to
pay
it
the
implacable
attackers
hurled
themselves
upon
their
objectives
here
were
no
feeble
spheres
of
space
commanding
only
the
limited
energies
transmitted
to
their
small
receptors
through
the
ether
instead
there
were
all
the
offensive
and
defensive
weapons
developed
by
hundreds
of
generations
of
wielding
all
the
incalculable
power
capable
of
being
produced
by
the
massed
generators
of
a
mighty
nation
but
for
the
breach
opened
in
the
circle
by
the
irresistible
surprise
attack
they
would
have
been
invulnerable
and
hampered
as
they
were
by
the
defenseless
ends
of
what
should
have
been
an
endless
ring
the
hexans
took
heavy
toll
the
heptagons
massive
and
solidly
braced
as
they
were
and
anchored
by
tractor
rays
as
well
shuddered
and
trembled
throughout
their
mighty
frames
under
the
impact
of
fiercely
driven
pressor
beams
sullenly
radiant
green
flared
brighter
and
brighter
as
the
vorkulian
absorbers
and
dissipators
mighty
as
they
were
continued
more
and
more
to
overload
for
there
were
being
directed
against
them
beams
from
the
entire
remaining
circumference
of
the
stronghold
every
deadly
frequency
and
emanation
known
to
the
fiendish
hexan
intellect
backed
by
the
full
power
of
the
city
was
poured
out
against
the
invaders
in
sizzling
shrieking
bars
bands
and
planes
of
frenzied
incandescence
nor
was
vibratory
destruction
alone
projectiles
of
enormous
size
and
weight
were
hurled
projectiles
which
clung
and
bored
upon
impact
shells
canisters
of
gas
and
the
frightful
aerial
bombs
and
torpedoes
of
highly
scientific
war
all
were
thrown
with
lavish
hand
as
fast
as
the
projectors
could
be
served
but
thrust
for
thrust
ray
for
ray
projectile
for
massive
projectile
the
brobdingnagian
creations
of
the
vorkuls
gave
back
to
the
hexans
the
material
lining
of
the
ghastly
moat
was
the
only
substance
capable
of
resisting
the
action
of
its
contents
and
now
that
lining
destroyed
by
the
uprooting
of
the
fortress
that
corrosive
brilliantly
mobile
liquid
cascaded
down
in
to
the
trough
and
added
its
hellish
contribution
to
the
furious
scene
for
whatever
that
devouring
fluid
touched
flared
into
yellow
flame
gave
off
clouds
of
lurid
strangling
vapor
and
disappeared
but
through
yellow
haze
through
blasting
frequencies
through
clouds
of
poisonous
gas
through
rain
of
metal
and
through
storm
of
explosive
the
two
cones
ground
implacably
onward
their
every
offensive
weapon
centered
upon
the
exposed
ends
of
the
hexan
fortress
their
bombs
and
torpedoes
ripped
and
tore
into
the
structure
beneath
the
invulnerable
shield
and
exploded
demolishing
and
hurling
aside
like
straws
the
walls
projectors
hexads
and
vast
mountains
of
earth
their
terrible
rays
bored
in
softening
fusing
volatilizing
metal
connections
destroying
life
far
ahead
of
the
point
of
attack
and
drawn
along
by
the
relentlessly
creeping
composite
tractor
beam
there
progressed
around
the
circumference
of
the
hexan
city
two
veritable
saturnalia
of
destruction
uninterrupted
cataclysmic
detonations
of
sound
and
sizzling
shrieking
displays
of
pyrotechnic
incandescence
combining
to
form
a
spectacle
of
violence
incredible
but
the
heptagons
could
not
absorb
nor
radiate
indefinitely
those
torrents
of
energy
and
soon
one
greenishly
incandescent
screen
went
down
giant
shells
pierced
the
green
metal
walls
giant
beams
of
force
fused
and
consumed
them
faster
and
faster
the
huge
heptagon
became
a
shapeless
flowing
mass
its
metal
dripping
away
in
flaming
gouts
of
brilliance
then
it
disappeared
utterly
in
one
terrific
blast
as
some
probing
enemy
ray
reached
a
vital
part
the
cone
did
not
pause
nor
waver
many
of
its
component
units
would
go
down
but
it
would
go
on
and
on
and
on
until
every
hexan
trace
had
disappeared
or
until
the
last
vorkulian
heptagon
had
been
annihilated
in
one
of
the
lowermost
heptagons
one
bearing
the
full
brunt
of
the
hexan
armament
kromodeor
reared
upright
as
his
projector
controls
went
dead
beneath
his
hands
finding
his
communicator
screens
likewise
lifeless
he
slipped
to
the
floor
and
wriggled
to
the
room
of
the
chief
power
officer
where
he
found
wixill
idly
fingering
his
controls
are
we
out
asked
kromodeor
tersely
all
done
the
chief
power
officer
calmly
replied
we
have
power
left
but
we
can
not
use
it
as
they
have
crushed
our
screens
and
are
fusing
our
outer
walls
two
out
of
seven
chances
and
we
drew
one
of
them
we
are
still
working
on
the
infra
band
over
across
on
the
second
board
but
we
wo
last
long
as
he
spoke
the
mighty
fabric
lurched
under
them
and
only
their
quick
and
powerful
tails
darting
in
lightning
loops
about
the
bars
saved
them
from
being
battered
to
death
against
the
walls
as
the
heptagon
was
hurled
end
over
end
by
a
stupendous
force
with
a
splintering
crash
it
came
to
rest
upon
the
ground
i
wonder
how
that
happened
they
should
have
rayed
us
out
or
exploded
us
kromodeor
pondered
the
vorkuls
with
their
inhumanly
powerful
sinuous
bodies
were
scarcely
affected
by
the
shock
of
that
frightful
fall
they
must
have
had
a
whole
battery
of
pressors
on
us
when
our
greens
went
out
they
threw
us
across
the
city
almost
into
the
gate
we
made
first
wixill
replied
studying
the
situation
of
the
vessel
in
the
one
small
screen
still
in
action
we
are
hurt
very
badly
only
a
few
holes
that
they
are
starting
to
weld
already
when
the
absorber
and
dissipator
crews
get
them
cooled
down
enough
so
that
we
can
use
power
again
we
go
back
but
they
were
not
to
resume
their
place
in
the
attack
through
the
holes
in
the
walls
hexan
soldiery
were
leaping
in
steady
streams
fighting
with
the
utmost
savagery
of
their
bloodthirsty
natures
urged
on
by
the
desperation
born
of
the
knowledge
of
imminent
defeat
and
total
destruction
roared
flashed
and
sparkled
heavy
bars
crashed
and
thudded
against
crunching
bones
mighty
bodies
and
tails
whipped
crushingly
about
forms
which
wrenched
and
tore
with
monstrously
powerful
hands
and
claws
fiercely
and
valiantly
the
vorkuls
fought
but
they
were
outnumbered
by
hundreds
and
only
one
outcome
was
possible
kromodeor
was
one
of
the
last
to
go
down
weapons
long
since
exhausted
he
unwrapped
his
deadly
coils
from
about
a
dead
hexan
and
darted
toward
a
storeroom
only
to
be
cut
off
by
a
horde
of
enemies
throwing
himself
down
a
vertical
shaft
he
flew
toward
a
tiny
in
the
lowermost
part
of
one
of
the
great
star
points
the
hexans
in
hot
pursuit
he
wrenched
the
door
open
and
even
while
searing
planes
of
force
were
riddling
his
body
he
trained
the
frightful
weapon
he
had
sought
he
pressed
the
contact
and
bursts
of
intolerable
flame
swept
the
entire
passage
clear
of
life
weakly
he
struggled
to
go
out
into
the
aisle
but
his
muscles
refused
to
do
the
bidding
of
his
will
and
he
lay
there
twitching
feebly
in
the
power
room
of
the
heptagon
a
hexan
officer
turned
fiercely
to
another
who
was
offering
advice
vorkuls
bah
he
snarled
viciously
our
race
is
finished
die
we
must
but
we
shall
take
with
us
the
one
enemy
who
above
all
others
needs
destruction
and
he
hurled
the
captured
vorkulian
fortress
into
the
air
as
the
heptagon
lurched
upward
the
massive
door
of
a
lower
projector
locker
clanged
shut
and
kromodeor
collapsed
in
a
corner
his
consciousness
blotted
out
well
that
certainly
tears
it
that
a
i
stevens
ready
vocabulary
failed
him
and
he
turned
to
brandon
who
was
still
staring
into
the
plate
watching
the
destruction
of
the
hexan
city
they
got
something
all
right
you
got
to
hand
it
to
them
brandon
replied
and
we
thought
we
knew
something
about
forces
and
physical
phenomena
in
general
those
birds
have
forgotten
more
than
we
ever
will
know
just
one
of
those
things
could
take
the
whole
fleet
armed
as
we
are
now
any
morning
before
breakfast
just
for
exercises
we
got
to
do
something
about
it
but
what
it
okay
whatever
you
say
there
may
be
an
out
somewhere
but
i
see
it
and
stevens
gloomy
tone
matched
his
words
highly
trained
scientists
both
they
had
been
watching
that
which
transcended
all
the
science
of
the
inner
planets
and
knew
themselves
outclassed
immeasurably
only
one
thing
to
do
as
i
see
it
brandon
cogitated
that
to
keep
on
going
straight
out
the
way
we
headed
now
we
better
call
a
council
of
war
to
dope
out
a
line
of
action
chapter
xii
the
citadel
in
space
for
the
first
time
in
many
days
brandon
and
westfall
sat
at
dinner
in
the
main
dining
room
of
the
they
were
enjoying
greatly
the
unaccustomed
pleasure
of
a
leisurely
formal
meal
but
still
their
talk
concerned
the
projection
of
pure
forces
instead
of
subjects
more
appropriate
to
the
table
still
their
eyes
paid
more
attention
to
diagrams
drawn
upon
scraps
of
paper
than
to
the
diners
about
them
but
i
tell
you
quince
you
full
of
little
red
ants
clear
to
the
neck
brandon
snorted
as
westfall
waved
one
of
his
arguments
aside
you
must
have
had
help
to
get
that
far
off
no
one
man
could
possibly
be
as
wrong
as
you
are
why
those
fields
absolutely
will
hi
quincy
hi
norman
a
merry
voice
interrupted
still
fighting
as
usual
i
see
what
kind
of
knights
are
you
anyway
to
rescue
us
poor
damsels
in
distress
and
then
never
even
know
that
we
alive
a
tall
willowy
brunette
had
seen
the
two
physicists
as
she
entered
the
saloon
and
came
over
to
their
table
a
hand
outstretched
to
each
in
cordial
greeting
ho
verna
both
men
exclaimed
and
came
to
their
feet
as
they
welcomed
the
smiling
graceful
newcomer
sit
down
here
verna
we
have
hardly
started
westfall
invited
and
brandon
looked
at
the
girl
in
assumed
surprise
as
she
seated
herself
in
the
proffered
chair
well
verna
it
like
this
he
began
that
enough
she
broke
in
that
phrase
always
was
your
introduction
to
one
of
the
world
greatest
brainstorms
but
i
know
that
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
had
time
even
to
eat
like
civilized
beings
so
forgive
you
this
once
why
all
the
registering
of
amazement
norman
i
astonished
that
you
are
being
monopolized
by
some
husband
or
other
surely
the
officers
of
the
were
so
dumb
that
stand
for
your
still
being
verna
were
they
not
dumb
norman
no
far
from
it
but
i
still
working
for
my
degree
and
i
have
succeeded
in
snaring
it
yet
you
be
surprised
at
how
cagy
those
officers
got
after
a
few
of
them
had
been
captured
but
they
are
just
like
any
other
hunted
game
i
suppose
the
antelopes
that
survive
get
pretty
wild
you
know
she
concluded
plaintively
well
that
certainly
is
one
tough
break
for
a
poor
little
girl
brandon
sympathized
quince
our
little
nell
here
has
been
done
right
by
i
bashful
and
you
a
but
between
us
some
way
we
simply
got
to
take
steps
you
might
take
longer
steps
than
you
think
verna
laughed
her
regular
white
teeth
and
vivid
coloring
emphasized
by
her
olive
skin
and
her
startling
hair
black
as
brandon
own
perhaps
i
would
like
a
scientist
better
than
an
officer
anyway
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
surer
i
am
that
nadia
newton
had
the
right
idea
i
believe
that
i
catch
me
a
physicist
too
either
of
you
would
do
quite
nicely
i
think
and
she
studied
the
two
men
carefully
westfall
the
methodical
and
precise
had
never
been
able
to
defend
himself
against
verna
pickering
badinage
but
brandon
ready
tongue
took
up
the
challenge
verna
if
you
really
decided
to
get
any
living
man
he
would
stand
a
chance
in
the
world
he
declared
if
you
already
made
up
your
mind
that
i
your
meat
i
come
down
like
davy
crockett
coon
but
if
either
of
us
will
do
that
give
us
each
a
chance
to
escape
your
toils
what
say
we
play
a
game
of
to
decide
it
fine
norman
when
shall
we
play
oh
between
wednesday
and
thursday
any
week
you
say
and
the
two
fenced
on
banteringly
but
skilfully
with
westfall
an
appreciative
and
unembarrassed
listener
dinner
over
brandon
and
westfall
went
back
to
the
control
room
where
they
found
stevens
already
seated
at
one
of
the
master
screens
all
x
perce
all
x
the
observers
report
no
registrations
during
the
last
two
watches
and
the
three
fell
into
discussion
long
they
talked
studying
every
angle
of
the
situation
confronting
them
until
suddenly
a
speaker
rattled
furiously
and
an
enormous
staring
eye
filled
both
master
plates
brandon
hand
flashed
to
a
switch
but
the
image
disappeared
even
before
he
could
establish
the
ray
screen
i
on
the
upper
band
take
the
lower
he
snapped
but
projector
was
already
in
action
trained
minds
all
they
knew
that
some
intelligence
had
traced
them
and
all
realized
that
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
to
know
what
and
where
that
intelligence
was
stevens
found
the
probing
frequency
in
his
range
and
they
flashed
their
own
beam
along
it
encountering
finally
one
of
the
monstrous
vorkulian
fortresses
far
from
jupiter
and
almost
directly
between
them
and
the
planet
its
wall
screens
were
in
operation
and
no
frequency
at
their
command
could
penetrate
that
neutralizing
blanket
of
vibrations
what
kind
of
an
eye
was
that
ever
see
anything
like
it
perce
brandon
demanded
i
do
think
so
though
of
course
we
got
only
an
awfully
short
flash
of
it
it
did
look
like
the
periscopic
eyes
that
those
flying
snakes
had
looked
more
like
a
hexan
eye
do
you
think
could
very
well
be
hexan
though
in
that
kind
of
a
ship
do
think
so
either
maybe
it
a
purely
mechanical
affair
that
they
use
for
observing
anyway
old
sons
i
do
like
the
looks
of
things
at
all
quince
you
the
brains
of
this
outfit
shift
the
massive
old
intellect
into
high
and
tell
us
what
to
do
westfall
staring
into
the
eyepiece
of
the
filar
micrometer
finished
measuring
the
apparent
size
of
the
heptagon
before
he
turned
toward
stevens
and
brandon
it
is
hard
to
decide
upon
a
course
of
action
since
anything
that
we
do
may
prove
to
be
wrong
he
said
slowly
however
i
do
not
see
that
this
latest
development
can
operate
to
change
the
plan
we
have
already
adopted
that
of
running
away
straight
out
from
the
sun
we
may
have
to
increase
our
acceleration
to
the
highest
value
the
women
and
babies
can
stand
a
series
of
observations
of
our
pursuer
will
of
course
be
necessary
to
decide
that
point
it
would
be
useless
to
go
to
titan
for
they
would
be
powerless
to
help
us
we
could
not
hold
their
mirror
upon
either
the
or
their
torpedoes
against
such
forces
as
that
fortress
has
at
her
command
then
too
we
might
well
be
bringing
down
upon
them
an
enemy
who
would
destroy
much
of
their
world
before
he
could
be
stopped
both
uranus
and
neptune
are
approximately
upon
our
present
course
do
the
titanians
know
anything
of
either
of
them
steve
not
a
thing
the
computer
replied
they
ca
get
nearly
as
far
as
uranus
on
their
power
beam
it
all
they
can
do
to
make
jupiter
they
seem
to
think
though
that
one
or
more
of
the
satellites
of
uranus
or
neptune
may
be
inhabited
by
beings
similar
to
themselves
only
perhaps
even
more
so
but
considering
the
difference
between
what
we
found
on
the
jovian
satellites
and
on
titan
i
say
that
anything
might
be
out
there
on
uranus
neptune
their
satellites
or
anywhere
else
cancel
uranus
and
double
that
for
neptune
brandon
commanded
realize
how
far
away
they
are
that
right
too
agreed
stevens
before
we
got
there
with
any
acceleration
we
can
use
now
this
whole
mess
will
be
cleaned
up
one
way
or
the
other
westfall
completed
the
series
of
observations
and
calculated
his
results
then
with
a
grave
face
he
went
to
consult
the
medical
officers
the
women
children
and
the
two
martian
scientists
were
sent
to
the
and
the
acceleration
was
raised
slowly
to
twenty
meters
per
second
per
second
above
which
point
the
physicians
declared
they
should
not
go
unless
it
became
absolutely
necessary
then
the
scientists
met
again
met
without
alcantro
and
fedanzo
who
lay
helpless
upon
narrow
hospital
bunks
unable
even
to
lift
their
massive
arms
while
westfall
made
another
series
of
precise
measurements
of
the
of
space
so
earnestly
pursuing
them
brandon
stumbled
heavily
about
the
room
hands
jammed
deep
into
pockets
eyes
unseeing
emitting
clouds
of
smoke
from
his
villainously
reeking
pipe
the
venetians
lacking
brandon
physical
strength
and
by
nature
quieter
of
disposition
sat
motionless
keen
minds
hard
at
work
stevens
sat
at
the
calculating
machine
absently
setting
up
and
knocking
down
weird
and
meaningless
integrals
while
he
also
concentrated
upon
the
problem
before
them
they
are
still
gaining
but
comparatively
slowly
westfall
finally
reported
they
seem
to
be
in
that
case
we
may
be
all
x
brandon
interrupted
brandishing
his
pipe
vigorously
we
know
that
they
on
a
beam
apparently
we
the
only
ones
hereabouts
having
cosmic
power
if
we
can
keep
away
from
them
until
their
beam
attenuates
we
can
whittle
down
to
our
size
and
then
take
them
no
matter
how
much
accumulator
capacity
they
got
but
can
we
keep
away
from
them
that
long
asked
dol
kenor
pointedly
and
his
fellow
venerian
also
had
a
question
to
propound
would
it
not
be
preferable
to
lead
them
in
a
wide
circle
back
to
a
rendezvous
with
the
space
fleet
which
will
probably
be
ready
by
the
time
of
meeting
i
am
afraid
that
that
would
be
useless
westfall
frowned
in
thought
given
power
that
fortress
could
destroy
the
entire
fleet
almost
as
easily
as
she
could
wipe
out
the
alone
kenor
right
stevens
spoke
up
from
the
calculator
you
getting
too
far
ahead
of
the
situation
we
are
apt
to
keep
ahead
of
them
long
enough
to
do
much
leading
anywhere
the
titanians
can
hold
a
beam
together
from
saturn
to
jupiter
why
ca
these
several
reasons
brandon
argued
stubbornly
first
place
look
at
the
mass
of
that
thing
and
remember
that
the
heavier
the
beam
the
harder
it
is
to
hold
it
together
second
there
no
evidence
that
they
wander
around
much
in
space
if
their
beams
are
designed
principally
for
travel
upon
jupiter
why
should
they
have
any
extraordinary
range
i
say
they
ca
hold
that
beam
forever
we
got
a
good
long
lead
and
in
spite
of
their
higher
acceleration
i
think
we
be
able
to
keep
out
of
range
of
their
heavy
stuff
if
so
we
trace
a
circle
only
one
a
good
deal
bigger
than
the
one
amonar
suggested
and
meet
the
fleet
at
a
point
where
that
enemy
ship
will
be
about
out
of
power
thus
for
hours
the
scientists
argued
agreeing
upon
nothing
while
the
vorkulian
fortress
crept
ever
closer
at
the
end
of
three
days
of
the
mad
flight
the
pursuing
space
ship
was
in
plain
sight
covering
hundreds
of
divisions
of
the
micrometer
screens
but
now
the
size
of
the
images
was
increasing
with
extreme
slowness
and
the
scientists
of
the
watched
with
strained
attention
the
edges
of
those
glowing
green
pictures
finally
when
the
pictured
edges
were
about
to
cease
moving
across
the
lines
brandon
cut
down
his
own
acceleration
a
trifle
and
kept
on
decreasing
it
at
such
a
rate
that
the
heptagon
still
crept
up
foot
by
foot
hey
what
the
big
idea
stevens
demanded
coax
along
if
we
run
away
from
them
they
probably
reverse
power
and
go
back
home
wo
they
their
beam
is
falling
apart
fast
but
they
still
getting
so
much
stuff
along
it
that
we
could
do
a
thing
to
stop
them
if
they
think
that
we
losing
power
even
faster
than
they
are
though
they
keep
after
us
until
their
beam
so
thin
that
they
just
be
able
to
stop
on
it
then
they
reverse
or
else
go
onto
their
accumulators
reverse
probably
since
they
be
a
long
ways
from
home
by
that
time
we
reverse
too
and
keep
just
out
of
range
then
when
we
both
have
stopped
and
are
about
to
start
back
their
beam
will
be
at
its
minimum
and
we
go
to
work
on
foot
horse
and
marines
nobody
can
run
us
as
ragged
as
they
been
doing
and
get
away
with
it
as
long
as
i
conscious
and
stand
a
chance
in
the
world
of
hanging
one
onto
their
chins
in
retaliation
i
got
a
hunch
if
it
works
we
can
take
those
birds
alone
and
take
so
they
took
we
might
as
well
break
up
this
is
going
to
be
an
ordinary
job
of
piloting
for
a
few
days
i
think
i
going
up
and
work
with
the
martians
on
that
hunch
you
fellows
work
out
any
ideas
you
want
to
watch
close
mac
keep
kidding
along
but
do
let
them
get
close
enough
to
puncture
us
everything
worked
out
practically
as
brandon
had
foretold
and
a
few
days
later
their
acceleration
somewhat
less
than
terrestrial
gravity
he
called
another
meeting
in
the
control
room
he
came
in
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
accompanied
by
the
two
martians
and
seated
himself
at
his
complex
power
panel
now
watch
the
professor
closely
gentlemen
he
invited
he
is
going
to
cut
that
beam
but
you
ca
protested
pyraz
amonar
i
know
you
ca
ordinarily
when
a
beam
is
tight
and
solid
but
that
beam
as
loose
as
ashes
right
now
i
told
you
i
had
a
hunch
and
alcantro
and
fedanzo
worked
out
the
right
answer
for
me
if
i
can
cut
it
quince
and
if
their
screens
go
down
for
a
minute
shoot
your
visiray
into
them
and
see
what
you
can
see
all
x
how
much
power
are
you
going
to
draw
plenty
it
figures
a
little
better
than
four
hundred
thousand
kilofranks
i
draw
it
all
from
the
accumulators
so
as
not
to
disturb
you
fellows
on
the
cosmic
intake
we
do
care
if
we
do
run
the
batteries
down
some
but
i
do
want
to
hold
that
load
on
the
very
long
however
if
my
hunch
is
right
i
wo
be
on
that
beam
five
minutes
before
it
cut
from
jupiter
and
i
bet
you
four
dollars
that
you
wo
see
the
original
crew
in
that
fort
when
you
get
into
it
he
set
upper
and
lower
bands
of
dirigible
projectors
to
apply
a
powerful
sidewise
thrust
and
the
darted
off
her
course
flashing
a
minute
pencil
behind
the
huge
heptagon
brandon
manipulated
his
tuning
circuits
until
a
brilliant
spot
in
space
showed
him
that
he
was
approaching
resonance
with
the
heptagon
power
beam
micrometer
dials
were
then
engaged
and
the
delicate
tuning
continued
until
the
meters
gave
evidence
that
the
two
beams
were
precisely
synchronized
and
exactly
opposite
in
phase
four
plunger
switches
closed
that
tiny
pilot
ray
became
an
enormous
rod
of
force
and
as
those
two
gigantic
beams
met
in
exact
opposition
and
neutralized
each
other
a
solid
wall
of
blinding
brilliance
appeared
in
the
empty
ether
behind
the
vorkulian
fortress
as
that
dazzling
wall
sprang
into
being
the
sparkling
green
protection
died
from
the
walls
of
the
heptagon
go
to
it
quince
brandon
yelled
but
the
suggestion
was
entirely
superfluous
even
before
the
had
died
westfall
beam
was
trying
to
get
through
it
and
when
the
visiray
revealed
the
interior
of
the
heptagon
the
quiet
and
methodical
physicist
was
shaken
from
his
habitual
calm
why
they
are
the
winged
monsters
at
all
they
he
exclaimed
sure
they
are
brandon
did
not
even
turn
his
eyes
from
the
blazing
blankness
of
his
own
screen
that
was
my
hunch
those
snakes
went
about
things
in
a
fashion
they
did
strike
me
as
being
folks
who
would
pull
off
such
a
wild
stunt
as
trying
to
chase
us
clear
out
of
the
solar
system
but
a
gang
of
hexans
would
do
just
that
some
of
them
must
have
captured
that
ship
and
already
having
it
in
their
brains
that
we
were
back
of
what
happened
on
callisto
they
decided
to
bump
us
off
if
it
was
the
last
thing
they
ever
did
that
what
i
do
myself
if
i
were
a
hexan
now
i
tell
you
what
happening
back
at
the
home
power
plant
of
that
ship
and
going
to
happen
next
i
kicking
up
a
horrible
row
out
there
with
my
interference
and
a
lot
of
instruments
at
the
other
end
of
that
beam
must
be
cutting
up
all
kinds
of
didoes
right
now
they
check
up
on
that
ship
with
the
expedition
by
radio
and
and
when
they
find
out
that
it
clear
out
here
chop
did
get
to
see
much
did
you
no
they
must
have
switched
over
to
their
accumulators
almost
instantly
yeah
but
if
they
got
accumulator
capacity
enough
to
hold
off
our
entire
cosmic
intake
and
get
back
to
jupiter
besides
i
a
polyp
going
to
take
that
ship
fellows
and
learn
a
lot
of
stuff
we
never
dreamed
of
before
ha
there
goes
his
beam
pay
me
the
four
quince
the
dazzling
wall
of
incandescence
had
blinked
out
without
warning
and
brandon
beam
bored
on
through
space
unimpeded
he
shut
it
off
and
turned
to
his
fellows
with
a
grin
a
grin
which
disappeared
instantly
as
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
leaped
back
to
his
board
sound
the
warning
quick
perce
he
snapped
and
drove
in
switch
after
switch
cosmic
intake
gone
down
to
zero
exclaimed
macdonald
as
the
leaped
away
had
to
cut
it
they
might
shoot
a
jolt
through
that
band
just
thought
of
something
maybe
unnecessary
but
no
harm
done
if
it
necessary
all
x
we
taking
a
sweet
kissing
right
now
you
see
even
though
we
at
pretty
long
range
they
got
some
horrible
projectors
and
they
were
evidently
mad
enough
to
waste
some
power
taking
a
good
solid
flash
at
us
and
if
we
had
been
expecting
it
that
flash
would
have
been
a
bountiful
sufficiency
believe
me
great
cat
look
at
that
meter
and
i
had
to
throw
in
number
ten
shunt
the
outer
screen
is
drawing
five
hundred
and
forty
thousand
they
stared
at
the
meter
in
amazement
it
was
incredible
even
after
they
had
seen
those
heptagons
in
action
that
at
such
extreme
range
any
offensive
beam
could
be
driven
with
such
unthinkable
power
power
requiring
for
its
neutralization
almost
the
full
output
of
the
prodigious
batteries
of
accumulators
carried
by
the
yet
for
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
minutes
that
beam
drove
furiously
against
their
straining
screens
and
even
brandon
face
grew
tense
and
hard
as
that
frightful
attack
continued
at
the
end
of
minutes
however
the
pointer
of
the
meter
snapped
back
to
the
pin
and
every
man
there
breathed
an
explosive
sigh
of
relief
the
almost
unbearable
bombardment
was
over
the
screen
was
drawing
only
its
maintenance
load
wow
brandon
shouted
i
thought
for
a
minute
they
were
going
to
hang
to
us
until
we
cracked
even
if
it
meant
that
they
have
to
freeze
to
death
out
here
themselves
it
would
have
meant
that
too
do
you
think
asked
stevens
i
imagine
so
do
see
how
they
could
possibly
have
enough
power
left
to
get
back
to
jupiter
if
they
shine
that
thing
on
us
much
longer
of
course
the
more
power
they
waste
on
us
the
quicker
we
can
take
them
but
i
do
want
much
more
of
that
beam
i
tell
the
world
i
just
about
had
heart
failure
before
they
cut
off
the
massive
heptagon
was
now
drifting
back
toward
jupiter
at
constant
velocity
the
hexans
were
apparently
hoarding
jealously
their
remaining
power
for
their
wall
screens
did
not
flash
on
at
the
touch
of
the
visiray
through
unresisting
metal
the
probing
terrestrial
beams
sped
and
the
scientists
studied
minutely
every
detail
of
the
vorkulian
armament
while
the
regular
observers
began
to
make
a
detailed
photographic
survey
of
every
room
and
compartment
of
the
great
fortress
much
of
the
instrumentation
and
machinery
was
familiar
but
some
of
it
was
so
strange
that
study
was
useless
days
of
personal
inspection
and
experiment
perhaps
complete
dismantling
would
be
necessary
to
reveal
the
secrets
hidden
within
those
peculiar
mechanisms
they
trying
to
save
all
the
power
they
can
think
i
make
them
spend
some
more
brandon
remarked
and
directed
against
the
heptagon
a
heavy
destructive
beam
we
do
want
them
to
get
back
to
jupiter
until
after
we
boarded
them
and
found
out
everything
we
want
to
know
come
here
quince
what
do
you
make
of
this
both
men
stared
at
the
heptagon
frankly
puzzled
for
the
screens
of
the
strange
vessel
did
not
radiate
nor
did
the
material
of
the
walls
yield
under
the
terrible
force
of
the
beam
the
destructive
ray
simply
struck
that
dull
green
surface
and
vanished
disappeared
without
a
trace
as
a
tiny
stream
of
water
disappears
into
a
sponge
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
asked
westfall
after
a
few
thought
i
believe
that
you
are
charging
their
accumulators
at
the
rate
of
he
glanced
at
a
meter
exactly
thousand
five
hundred
kilofranks
great
cat
brandon
hand
flashed
to
a
switch
and
the
beam
expired
but
they
ca
just
simply
grab
it
and
store
it
quince
impossible
the
word
in
that
connection
coming
from
you
has
a
queer
sound
westfall
said
pointedly
and
brandon
actually
blushed
that
right
too
we
have
got
pretty
much
the
same
idea
in
our
cosmic
intake
fields
but
we
did
carry
things
half
as
far
as
they
have
done
huh
they
flashing
us
again
but
those
thin
little
beams
mean
anything
they
just
trying
to
make
us
feed
them
some
more
i
guess
but
we
got
to
hold
them
back
some
way
wonder
if
they
can
absorb
a
tractor
field
the
hexans
had
lashed
out
a
few
times
with
their
lighter
weapons
but
finding
the
unresponsive
had
soon
shut
them
off
and
were
stolidly
plunging
along
toward
jupiter
brandon
flung
out
a
tractor
rod
and
threw
the
mass
of
his
cruiser
upon
it
as
it
locked
into
those
sullen
green
walls
but
as
soon
as
the
enemy
felt
its
drag
their
screens
flared
white
and
the
massive
terrestrial
quivered
in
every
member
as
that
terrific
cable
of
force
was
snapped
they
apparently
can
not
store
up
the
energy
of
a
tractor
commented
westfall
but
you
will
observe
that
they
have
no
difficulty
in
radiating
when
they
care
to
those
two
ideas
did
pan
out
so
heavy
there
lots
of
things
not
tried
yet
though
our
next
best
bet
is
to
get
around
in
front
of
him
and
push
back
if
they
wiggle
away
from
more
than
fifty
percent
of
a
pressor
they
really
good
the
pilot
maneuvered
the
into
line
directly
between
jupiter
and
the
pentagon
and
as
the
driving
projectors
went
into
action
brandon
drove
a
mighty
pressor
field
along
their
axis
squarely
into
the
center
of
mass
of
the
vorkulian
fortress
for
a
moment
it
held
solidly
then
as
the
screens
of
the
enemy
went
into
action
it
rebounded
and
glanced
off
in
sparkling
cascading
torrents
but
the
hexans
with
all
their
twisting
and
turning
could
not
present
to
that
prodigious
beam
of
force
any
angle
sufficiently
obtuse
to
rob
it
of
half
its
power
and
the
driving
projectors
of
the
pentagon
again
burst
into
activity
as
the
mass
of
the
made
itself
felt
in
a
short
time
however
the
were
again
cut
off
apparently
more
power
was
required
to
drive
them
than
they
were
able
to
deflect
although
even
the
enormous
tonnage
of
the
terrestrial
cruiser
was
insignificant
in
comparison
with
the
veritable
mountain
of
metal
to
which
she
was
opposed
so
that
the
fiercest
thrust
of
her
driving
projectors
did
not
greatly
affect
the
monster
progress
yet
brandon
and
his
cohorts
were
well
content
it
a
long
trip
back
to
where
they
came
from
and
since
they
wanted
to
drift
all
the
way
i
think
they
be
out
of
power
before
they
get
there
brandon
summed
up
the
situation
we
are
losing
any
power
either
since
we
are
using
only
a
part
of
our
cosmic
intake
in
a
few
hours
the
struggle
had
settled
down
to
a
routine
matter
the
being
pushed
backward
steadily
against
the
full
drive
of
her
every
projector
contesting
stubbornly
every
mile
of
space
traversed
assured
that
the
regular
pilots
and
lookouts
were
fully
capable
of
handling
the
vessel
the
scientists
were
about
to
resume
their
interrupted
tasks
when
one
of
the
photographers
called
them
over
to
look
at
something
he
had
discovered
in
one
of
the
lowermost
and
smallest
compartments
of
the
heptagon
all
crowded
around
the
screens
and
saw
pictured
there
the
winged
form
of
one
of
the
original
crew
of
the
vorkulian
vessel
dead
brandon
asked
not
yet
replied
the
photographer
he
is
twitching
a
little
once
in
a
while
but
you
see
he
pretty
badly
cut
up
i
see
he
is
he
must
have
a
lot
of
vitality
to
have
lasted
this
long
may
be
he
live
through
it
yet
hold
him
on
the
plate
and
get
his
exact
measurements
he
turned
to
the
communicator
doctor
von
steiffel
can
you
come
down
to
the
control
room
a
minute
we
may
want
you
to
operate
upon
one
of
these
south
jovians
after
a
while
es
ist
der
the
great
surgeon
bearded
and
massive
stared
into
the
plate
and
in
his
surprise
started
to
speak
in
his
native
german
he
paused
his
long
powerful
fingers
tracing
the
likeness
of
the
vorkul
upon
the
plate
then
went
on
i
would
like
very
much
to
operate
but
not
understanding
our
intentions
he
would
of
course
struggle
and
when
that
body
struggles
and
he
waved
his
arms
in
a
pantomime
of
wholesale
destruction
i
thought
of
that
that
why
i
am
talking
to
you
now
instead
of
when
we
get
to
him
two
or
three
days
from
now
we
give
you
his
exact
measurements
and
a
crew
of
mechanics
will
under
your
direction
sink
holes
in
the
steel
floor
and
install
steel
bands
heavy
enough
to
hold
him
rigid
from
tailfins
to
we
hold
him
there
until
we
can
make
him
understand
that
we
friends
it
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
save
that
creature
life
if
possible
because
we
do
not
want
one
of
their
fortresses
launched
against
us
and
in
any
event
it
will
not
do
us
any
harm
to
have
a
friend
in
the
city
of
the
south
right
i
will
also
have
prepared
some
kind
of
a
in
which
he
can
be
brought
from
his
vessel
to
ours
and
the
surgeon
took
the
measurements
and
went
to
see
that
the
operating
table
and
suit
were
made
ready
for
kromodeor
the
sorely
wounded
vorkul
it
was
not
long
until
the
projectors
of
the
heptagon
went
out
and
she
lay
inert
in
space
power
completely
exhausted
knowing
that
the
screens
of
the
enemy
would
absorb
any
ordinary
ray
the
scientists
had
calculated
the
most
condensed
beam
they
could
possibly
project
a
beam
which
their
figures
showed
should
be
able
to
puncture
those
screens
by
sheer
mass
action
puncture
them
practically
instantaneously
before
the
absorbers
could
react
to
that
end
they
had
arranged
their
circuits
to
hurl
seven
hundred
thousand
kilofranks
the
entire
power
of
their
massed
accumulators
and
their
highest
possible
cosmic
intake
in
one
tiny
bar
of
superlative
density
less
than
one
meter
in
diameter
everything
ready
brandon
shot
in
prodigious
switches
that
launched
that
bolt
a
bolt
so
vehement
so
inconceivably
intense
that
it
seemed
fairly
to
blast
the
very
ether
out
of
existence
as
it
tore
its
way
along
its
carefully
predetermined
line
the
intention
was
to
destroy
all
the
control
panels
of
the
absorber
screens
parts
so
vital
that
without
them
the
great
vessel
would
be
helpless
and
yet
items
which
the
terrestrials
could
reconstruct
quite
readily
from
their
photographs
and
drawings
as
that
irresistible
bolt
touched
the
vorkulian
the
spot
of
contact
flared
instantaneously
through
the
spectrum
and
into
the
black
beyond
the
violet
as
that
screen
overloaded
locally
fast
as
it
responded
and
highly
conductive
though
it
was
it
could
not
handle
that
frightfully
concentrated
load
in
the
same
fleeting
instant
of
time
every
molecule
of
substance
in
that
beam
path
flashed
into
tenuous
vapor
no
conceivable
material
could
resist
or
impede
that
stabbing
stiletto
of
energy
and
the
main
control
panel
of
the
vorkulian
system
vanished
time
after
time
as
rapidly
as
he
could
sight
his
beam
and
operate
his
switches
brandon
drove
his

destroying

then
the
walls
unresisting
he
cut
in
the
vastly
larger
but
infinitely
less
powerful

and
with
it
systematically
riddled
the
immense
heptagon
out
through
the
gaping
holes
in
the
outer
walls

the
dense
atmosphere
of

the

their
massed
hundreds
died
the

brought
up
beside
the
heptagon
so
that
her
main
was
against
one
of
the
yawning
holes
in
the
green
metal
wall
of
the
enemy
there
she
was
anchored
by
tractor
beams
and
the
two
hundred
picked
men
of
the
police
in
full
space
equipment
prepared
to
board
the
gigantic
fortress
of
the
void
brandon
sat
tense
at
his
controls
ready
to
send
his
beam
ahead
of
the
troopers
against
any
hexans
that
might
survive
in
some
as
yet
unpunctured
compartment
general
crowninshield
sat
beside
the
physicist
at
an
auxiliary
board
phones
at
ears
and
four
visiray
plates
ranged
in
front
of
him
ready
through
light
or
darkness
to
direct
and
oversee
the
attack
no
matter
where
it
might
lead
or
how
widely
separated
the
platoons
might
become
before
the
citadel
was
taken
the
men
the
engineers
of
weightless
combat
led
the
van
protected
by
the
projectors
of
their
fellows
theirs
the
task
to
set
up
ways
of
rope
along
which
the
others
could
advance
power
drills
bit
savagely
into
metal
making
holes
to
receive
the
expanding
eyebolts
grappling
hooks
seized
fast
every
protuberance
and
corner
points
of
little
stress
were
supported
by
powerful
suction
cups
and
at
intervals
were
strung
lanterns
illuminating
brilliantly
the
line
of
march
through
compartments
and
down
corridors
they
went
bridging
the
many
gaps
in
the
metal
through
which
brandon
beams
had
blasted
their
way
guided
by
crowninshield
along
the
shortest
feasible
path
toward
the
little
projector
room
in
which
kromodeor
the
wounded
vorkul
lay
there
were
so
many
chambers
and
compartments
in
the
heptagon
that
it
had
of
course
been
impossible
to
puncture
them
all
and
in
some
of
the
tight
rooms
were
groups
of
hexans
anxious
to
do
battle
but
the
general
eye
led
his
men
and
if
such
a
room
lay
before
them
brandon
frightful
beam
entered
it
first
and
where
that
beam
entered
life
departed
but
the
hexans
were
really
intelligent
as
has
been
said
they
had
had
time
to
prepare
for
what
they
knew
awaited
them
and
they
were
rendered
utterly
desperate
by
the
knowledge
that
no
matter
what
might
happen
their
course
was
run
their
power
was
gone
and
even
if
the
present
enemy
should
be
driven
off
they
would
float
idly
in
space
until
they
died
of
cold
or
more
probably
hurtling
toward
jupiter
as
they
were
they
would
plunge
to
certain
death
upon
its
surface
as
soon
as
they
came
within
its
powerful
gravitational
field
therefore
some
fifty
of
the
creatures
who
had
had
space
experience
in
their
spherical
vessels
had
spent
the
preceding
days
in
manufacturing
space
equipment
let
the
plan
upon
detonating
magazines
of
explosives
upon
laying
mines
calculated
to
destroy
the
invaders
even
the
vessel
itself
and
all
within
it
let
them
plan
upon
any
other
such
idle
schemes
which
were
certain
to
be
foreseen
and
guarded
against
by
the
veterans
who
undoubtedly
moaned
that
and
vengeful
football
of
scarred
gray
metal
were
they
and
as
would
they
die
taking
with
them
to
their
own
inevitable
death
a
full
quota
of
the
enemy
thus
it
came
about
that
the
head
of
the
column
of
police
had
scarcely
passed
a
certain
door
when
in
the
room
behind
it
there
began
to
assemble
the
spacehounds
of
the
hexans
when
the
vanguard
had
approached
that
room
crowninshield
had
inspected
it
thoroughly
with
his
beams
he
had
found
it
punctured
and
airless
devoid
of
life
or
of
lethal
devices
and
had
passed
on
but
now
the
warriors
of
the
horde
guided
in
their
hiding
by
their
own
visirays
were
massing
there
when
the
center
of
the
column
reached
that
door
it
burst
open
there
boiled
out
into
the
corridor
into
the
very
midst
of
the
police
fifty
demoniacal
hexans
fighting
with
berserk
fury
ruled
by
but
one
impulse
to
kill
flashed
viciously
tearing
at
steel
armor
and
at
bulging
bit
and
tore
pikes
and
lances
were
driven
with
the
full
power
of
brawny
arms
here
and
there
could
be
seen
trooper
and
hexan
locked
together
in
fierce
embrace
far
from
any
six
limbs
against
four
all
ten
plied
with
abandon
in
mortal
combat
give

yelled
crowninshield
into
the
ears
of
his
men
epstein

lefevre

get
out
of
block
ten
give
us
a
chance
to
use
a
beam
as
the
police
fell
back
out
of
the
designated
section
of
the
corridor
brandon
beam
tore
through
it
filling
it
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
a
volume
of
intolerable
energy
in
that
energy
walls
doorway
and
as
well
as
most
of
the
hexans
vanished
utterly
but
the
beam
could
not
be
used
again
every
surviving
enemy
had
hurled
himself
frantically
into
the
thickest
ranks
of
the
police
and
the
battle
raged
fiercer
than
ever
it
did
not
last
long
the
ends
of
the
column
had
already
closed
in
the
police
filled
the
corridor
and
overflowed
into
the
yawning
chasm
cut
by
the
annihilating
ray
outnumbered
surrounded
upon
all
sides
above
and
below
by
the
terrestrials
the
hexans
fought
with
mad
desperation
to
the
last
man
and
to
the
last
man
died
and
even
though
in
lieu
of
their
own
highly
efficient
they
had
fought
in
weak
crude
and
hastily
improvised
which
were
pitifully
inferior
to
the
ray
resistant
heavy
steel
armor
of
the
forces
nevertheless
the
enormous
strength
and
utter
savagery
of
the
hexans
had
taken
toll
and
when
the
advance
was
resumed
it
was
with
extra
lookouts
scanning
the
entire
neighborhood
of
the
line
of
march
since
the
troops
had
entered
the
fortress
as
close
to
their
goal
as
possible
it
was
not
long
until
the
leading
platoon
reached
the
door
behind
which
kromodeor
lay
tools
and
cylinders
of
air
were
brought
up
and
the
engineers
quickly
fitted
pressure
bulkheads
across
the
corridor
there
was
a
screaming
hiss
from
the
valves
the
atmosphere
in
that
space
became
dense
and
mechanics
attacked
with
their
power
drills
the
door
of
the
projector
room
it
opened
and
four
husky
orderlies
rapidly
but
gently
encased
the
long
body
of
the
vorkul
in
the
built
especially
to
receive
it
as
that
monstrous
form
in
its
weirdly
bulging
envelope
was
guided
through
the
into
the
crowninshield
barked
orders
into
his
transmitter
and
the
police
reformed
they
would
now
systematically
scour
the
fortress
to
wipe
out
any
hexans
that
might
still
be
in
hiding
to
discover
and
destroy
any
possible
traps
or
infernal
machines
which
the
enemy
might
have
planted
for
their
undoing
assured
that
the
real
danger
to
the
was
over
and
that
his
presence
was
no
longer
necessary
brandon
turned
his
controls
over
to
an
assistant
and
went
up
to
the
venerian
rooms
where
von
steiffel
and
his
staff
were
to
operate
upon
the
vorkul
there
in
the
dense
hot
air
but
little
different
now
from
the
atmosphere
of
jupiter
kromodeor
lay
bolted
down
to
the
solid
steel
of
the
floor
by
means
of
padded
steel
straps
so
heavy
were
the
bands
that
he
could
not
possibly
break
even
one
of
them
so
closely
were
they
spaced
that
he
could
scarcely
have
moved
a
muscle
had
he
tried
but
he
did
not
try
so
near
death
was
he
that
his
mighty
muscles
did
not
even
quiver
at
the
trenchant
bite
of
the
surgeon
tools
von
steiffel
and
his
aides
meticulously
covered
with
sterile
gowns
hoods
and
gloves
worked
in
most
rigidly
aseptic
style
deftly
and
rapidly
closing
the
ghastly
wounds
inflicted
by
the
weapons
of
the
hexans
hi
brandon
the
surgeon
grunted
as
he
straightened
up
the
work
completed
i
did
not
use
much
antiseptic
on
him
because
of
possible
differences
in
blood
chemistry
and
in
ignorance
of
his
native
bacteria
i
depended
almost
wholly
upon
asepsis
and
his
natural
resistance
it
is
a
good
thing
that
we
did
not
have
to
use
an
anaesthetic
he
is
in
bad
shape
but
if
we
can
feed
him
successfully
he
may
pull
through
feed
him
i
never
thought
of
that
what
suppose
he
eats
i
have
an
idea
that
it
is
something
highly
concentrated
from
his
anatomy
i
shall
try
giving
him
sugar
milk
chocolate
something
of
the
kind
first
i
shall
try
maple
syrup
being
a
liquid
it
is
easily
administered
and
its
penetrating
odor
also
may
be
a
help
a
can
of
the
liquid
was
brought
in
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
terrestrials
the
long
delicate
antennae
of
the
vorkul
began
to
twitch
as
soon
as
the
can
was
opened
motioning
hastily
for
silence
von
steiffel
filled
a
bowl
and
placed
it
upon
the
floor
beneath
grotesque
nose
the
twitching
increased
until
finally
one
dull
glazed
eye
brightened
somewhat
and
curled
slowly
out
upon
its
slender
pedicle
toward
the
dish
his
mouth
opened
sluggishly
and
a
long
red
tongue
reached
out
but
as
his
perceptions
quickened
he
became
conscious
of
the
strangers
near
him
the
mouth
snapped
shut
the
eye
retracted
and
heaving
rippling
surges
traversed
that
powerful
body
as
he
struggled
madly
against
the
unbreakable
shackles
of
steel
binding
him
to
the
floor
the
surgeon
bent
anxiously
over
that
grotesque
but
frightened
head
soothing
polysyllabic
german
crooning
from
his
bearded
lips
here
let
try
this
i
good
on
it
stevens
suggested
bringing
up
the
callistonian
thought
exchanger
all
three
men
donned
headsets
and
sent
wave
after
wave
of
friendly
and
soothing
thoughts
toward
that
frantic
and
terrified
brain
he
got
his
brain
shut
up
like
a
clam
brandon
snorted
open
up
guy
we
are
going
to
hurt
you
we
the
best
friends
you
got
if
you
only
knew
it
himmel
und
he
iss
himself
killing
moaned
von
steiffel
one
more
chance
that
might
work
and
brandon
stepped
over
to
the
communicator
demanding
that
verna
pickering
be
brought
at
once
she
came
in
as
soon
as
the
would
permit
and
the
physicist
welcomed
her
eagerly
this
fellow
fighting
so
he
tearing
himself
to
pieces
we
ca
make
him
receive
a
thought
and
von
steiffel
afraid
to
use
an
anaesthetic
now
it
barely
possible
that
he
may
understand
hexan
i
thought
you
wasted
time
learning
any
of
it
but
maybe
you
did
see
if
you
can
make
him
understand
that
we
friends
the
girl
flinched
and
shrank
back
involuntarily
but
forced
herself
to
approach
that
awful
head
bending
over
she
repeated
over
and
over
one
harsh
barking
syllable
the
effect
of
that
word
was
magical
instantly
kromodeor
ceased
struggling
an
eye
curled
out
and
that
long
supple
tongue
flashed
down
and
into
the
syrup
not
until
the
last
sticky
trace
had
been
licked
from
the
bowl
did
his
attention
wander
from
the
food
then
the
eye
sparkling
brightly
now
was
raised
toward
the
girl
simultaneously
four
other
eyes
arose
one
directed
at
each
of
the
men
and
the
other
surveying
his
bonds
and
the
room
in
which
he
was
then
the
vorkul
spoke
but
his
whistling
hissing
manner
of
speech
so
garbled
the
barking
sounds
of
the
hexan
words
he
was
attempting
to
utter
that
verna
slight
knowledge
of
the
language
was
of
no
use
she
therefore
put
on
one
of
the
headsets
motioning
the
men
to
do
the
same
and
approached
kromodeor
with
the
other
repeating
the
hexan
word
of
friendly
import
this
time
the
vorkul
brain
was
not
sealed
against
the
visitors
and
thoughts
began
to
flow
you
used
those
things
a
lot
brandon
turned
to
stevens
in
a
quick
aside
can
you
hide
your
thoughts
sure
why
all
i
can
think
of
is
that
power
system
of
theirs
and
he
know
what
we
were
going
to
do
sure
and
i
better
be
getting
at
it
anyway
so
you
can
wipe
that
off
your
mind
with
a
clear
conscience
the
rest
of
us
will
get
everything
they
got
there
your
job
to
get
everything
you
can
out
of
this
bird
brain
all
x
all
x
why
you
did
put
yours
on
verna
exclaimed
no
i
do
think
i
have
time
if
i
get
started
talking
to
him
now
i
be
here
from
now
on
and
i
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
steve
can
talk
to
him
for
me
see
you
later
and
brandon
was
gone
he
went
directly
to
the
vorkulian
fortress
bare
now
of
hexan
life
and
devoid
of
hexan
snares
and
traps
there
he
and
his
fellows
labored
day
after
day
learning
every
secret
of
every
item
of
armament
and
equipment
aboard
the
heptagon
did
you
finish
up
today
norm
asked
stevens
one
evening
coming
to
life
fast
he
able
to
wiggle
around
a
little
now
and
is
insisting
that
we
take
off
the
one
chain
we
keep
on
him
and
let
him
use
a
plate
to
call
his
people
all
washed
up
guess
i
go
in
and
talk
to
him
you
all
say
he
such
an
egg
with
this
stuff
off
my
mind
i
can
hide
it
well
enough
by
the
way
what
does
he
eat
and
the
two
friends
set
out
for
the
venerian
rooms
anything
that
sweet
apparently
with
just
enough
milk
to
furnish
a
little
protein
wo
eat
meat
or
vegetables
at
all
von
steiffel
says
they
have
got
much
of
a
digestive
tract
and
i
know
that
they
got
any
teeth
he
already
eaten
most
all
the
syrup
we
had
on
board
all
of
the
milk
chocolate
and
a
lot
of
the
sugar
but
none
of
us
can
get
any
kind
of
a
raise
out
of
him
at
all
not
even
nadia
when
she
fed
him
a
whole
box
of
chocolates
no
i
mean
what
does
he
eat
when
he
home
it
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
syrup
made
from
the
juices
of
jungle
plants
which
they
drag
in
on
automatic
conveyors
and
process
on
automatic
machinery
but
he
a
funny
mutt
hard
to
get
some
of
his
thoughts
are
lucid
enough
but
others
we
ca
make
out
at
all
they
are
so
foreign
to
all
human
nature
that
they
simply
do
not
register
as
thoughts
at
all
one
funny
thing
he
is
the
least
bit
curious
about
anything
he
does
want
to
examine
anything
does
ask
us
any
questions
and
wo
tell
us
anything
about
anything
so
that
all
we
know
about
him
we
found
out
purely
by
accident
for
instance
they
like
games
and
sports
and
seem
to
have
families
they
also
have
love
liking
and
respect
for
others
of
their
own
race
but
they
seem
to
have
no
emotions
whatever
for
outsiders
they
utterly
inhuman
i
ca
describe
it
you
have
to
get
it
for
yourself
did
you
find
out
about
the
callistonians
who
went
to
see
them
negatively
yes
they
never
arrived
they
probably
could
see
in
the
fog
and
must
have
missed
the
city
if
they
tried
to
land
in
that
jungle
it
was
just
too
bad
that
would
account
for
everything
so
they
strictly
neutral
eh
well
i
tell
him
anyway
now
in
the
sickroom
brandon
picked
up
the
headset
and
sent
out
a
wave
of
cheery
greeting
to
his
amazement
the
mind
of
the
vorkul
was
utterly
unresponsive
to
his
thoughts
not
disdainful
not
inimical
not
appreciative
nor
friendly
simply
indifferent
to
a
degree
unknown
and
incomprehensible
to
any
human
mind
he
sent
brandon
only
one
message
which
came
clear
and
coldly
emotionless
i
do
not
want
to
talk
to
you
tell
the
hairy
doctor
that
i
am
now
strong
enough
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
communicator
screen
that
is
all
the
vorkul
mind
again
became
an
oblivious
maze
of
unintelligible
thoughts
not
deliberately
were
kromodeor
thoughts
hidden
he
was
constitutionally
unable
to
interest
himself
in
the
thoughts
or
things
of
any
alien
intelligence
well
that
for
that
a
puzzled
thoughtful
look
came
over
face
as
he
called
von
steiffel
a
queer
duck
if
there
ever
was
one
however
their
ship
will
never
bother
us
that
one
good
thing
and
i
think
we
got
about
everything
of
theirs
that
we
want
anyway
the
surgeon
after
a
careful
examination
of
his
patient
unlocked
the
heavy
collar
with
which
he
had
been
restraining
the
vorkul
and
supported
him
lightly
at
the
communicator
panel
as
surely
as
though
he
had
used
those
controls
for
years
kromodeor
shot
the
visiray
beam
out
into
space
one
hand
upon
each
of
the
several
dials
and
one
eye
upon
each
meter
it
was
a
matter
only
of
seconds
for
him
to
get
in
touch
with
vorkulia
to
the
terrestrials
the
screen
was
a
gray
and
foggy
blank
but
the
manifest
excitement
shrieking
and
whistling
from
the
speaker
in
response
to
kromodeor
signals
made
it
plain
that
his
message
was
being
received
with
enthusiasm
they
are
coming
the
vorkul
thought
and
lay
back
exhausted
just
as
well
that
they
comin
out
here
at
that
brandon
commented
we
could
begin
to
handle
that
structure
anywhere
near
jupiter
in
fact
we
would
want
to
get
very
close
ourselves
with
passengers
aboard
such
was
the
power
of
the
vorkulian
vessels
that
in
less
than
twenty
hours
another
heptagon
slowed
to
a
halt
beside
the
and
two
of
its
crew
were
wafted
aboard
they
were
ushered
into
the
venerian
room
where
they
talked
briefly
with
their
wounded
fellow
before
they
dressed
him
in
a
which
they
filled
with
air
to
their
own
pressure
then
all
three
were
lifted
lightly
into
the
air
and
without
a
word
or
a
sign
were
borne
through
the
of
the
vessel
and
into
an
opening
in
the
wall
of
the
rescuing
heptagon
a
green
tractor
beam
reached
out
seizing
the
derelict
and
both
structures
darted
away
at
such
a
pace
that
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
disappeared
in
the
black
depths
of
space
well
that
as
i
may
have
remarked
before
is
indisputably
and
conclusively
that
brandon
broke
the
surprised
almost
stunned
silence
that
followed
the
unceremonious
departure
of
the
visitors
i
do
know
whether
to
feel
relieved
at
the
knowledge
that
they
wo
bother
us
or
whether
to
get
mad
because
they
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
us

triumphant
now
that
the
hexan
threat
that
had
so
long
oppressed
the
humanity
of
the
was
lifted
that
dull
gray
football
of
armor
steel
was
filled
with
relief
and
rejoicing
as
the
pilot
laid
his
course
for
europa
lounges
and
saloons
resounded
with
noise
as
police
passengers
and
such
of
the
crew
as
were
at
liberty
made
merry
the
control
room
in
which
were
grouped
the
leaders
of
the
expedition
and
the
scientists
was
orderly
enough
but
a
noticeable
undertone
of
gladness
had
replaced
the
tense
air
it
had
known
so
long
hi
men
nadia
stevens
and
verna
pickering
arms
around
each
waists
entered
the
room
and
saluted
the
group
gaily
before
they
became
a
part
of
it
girls
tired
of
dancing
already
asked
brandon
oh
no
we
could
dance
from
now
on
verna
assured
him
but
you
see
nadia
had
seen
that
husband
of
hers
for
fifteen
minutes
and
was
getting
lonesome
being
afraid
of
all
you
men
she
wanted
me
to
come
along
for
moral
support
the
real
reason
i
came
though
and
she
narrowed
her
expressive
eyes
and
lowered
her
voice
mysteriously
is
that
you
two
physicists
are
here
i
want
to
study
my
chosen
victims
a
little
longer
before
i
decide
over
which
of
you
to
cast
the
spell
of
my
fatal
charm
but
you
ca
do
that
he
objected
vigorously
quince
and
i
are
going
to
settle
that
ourselves
some
day
by
shooting
dice
or
maybe
each
other
or
he
broke
off
listening
to
an
animated
conversation
going
on
behind
them
just
simply
outrageous
nadia
was
exclaiming
here
we
saved
his
life
and
i
fed
him
a
lot
of
my
candy
and
we
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
bringing
their
ship
back
here
almost
to
jupiter
for
them
and
then
they
simply
dashed
off
without
a
word
of
thanks
or
anything
and
he
always
acted
as
though
he
never
wanted
to
see
or
hear
of
any
of
us
again
ever
why
they
do
straight
as
norman
would
say
it
they
of
little
red
why
they
are
even
sure
not
brandon
turned
to
the
flushed
speaker
they
could
be
hardly
with
their
but
is
it
absolutely
necessary
that
all
intelligent
beings
should
possess
such
an
emotion
as
gratitude
such
a
being
without
it
does
seem
funny
to
us
but
i
ca
see
that
its
lack
necessarily
implies
anything
particularly
important
keep
still
a
minute
he
went
on
as
nadia
tried
to
interrupt
him
and
listen
to
some
real
wisdom
quince
tell
they
are
of
course
very
highly
developed
and
extremely
intelligent
but
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
intelligence
should
manifest
itself
in
ways
quite
baffling
to
us
human
beings
whose
minds
work
so
differently
they
are
however
well
peculiar
i
keep
still
nadia
burst
out
at
the
first
opportunity
i
do
want
to
talk
about
those
hideous
things
any
more
anyway
come
on
steve
let
go
up
and
dance
crowninshield
turned
to
verna
with
the
obvious
intention
of
leading
her
away
but
brandon
interposed
sorry
crown
but
this
lady
is
conducting
a
highly
important
psychological
research
so
your
purely
social
claims
will
have
to
wait
until
after
the
scientific
work
is
done
why
narrow
the
field
of
investigation
laughed
the
girl
i
rather
widen
it
myself
i
might
prefer
a
general
even
to
a
physicist
they
went
up
to
the
main
saloon
and
joined
the
m√™l√©e
there
and
after
one
dance
with
verna
all
he
could
claim
in
that
crowd
of
men
crowninshield
turned
to
brandon
you
two
seem
to
know
miss
pickering
extraordinarily
well
would
i
be
stepping
on
your
toes
if
i
give
her
a
play
clear
ether
as
far
as
we
concerned
brandon
shrugged
his
shoulders
she
been
kicking
around
under
foot
ever
since
she
was
knee
high
to
a
duck
we
gave
her
her
first
lessons
on
a
slide
rule
do
be
dumb
norman
that
woman
a
a
riot
a
regular
oh
she
all
x
as
far
as
that
goes
she
a
good
little
scout
too
not
half
as
dumb
as
she
acts
and
she
one
of
the
squarest
little
aces
that
ever
waved
a
plume
but
as
for
her
too
much
like
our
kid
sister
good
me
for
her
and
they
made
their
way
back
down
to
the
control
room
stevens
after
his
one
dance
with
nadia
had
already
returned
brandon
and
crowninshield
found
him
seated
at
the
calculating
machine
continuing
a
problem
which
already
filled
several
pages
of
his
notebook
steve
so
glad
to
see
a
calculator
and
some
paper
that
you
ca
let
them
alone
not
exactly
just
had
a
thought
a
day
or
so
ago
been
computing
the
orbit
of
the
wreckage
of
the
around
jupiter
think
we
should
salvage
it
the
upper
half
at
least
it
was
left
intact
you
know
h
m
that
would
be
nice
all
right
dope
enough
got
the
direction
solid
from
my
own
observations
the
velocity
a
pretty
rough
approximation
though
but
after
allowing
for
my
probable
error
it
figures
an
ellipse
of
low
eccentricity
between
the
orbits
of
io
and
europa
its
period
is
short
about
two
days
is
it
wonderful
to
have
a
brain
brandon
addressed
the
room
at
large
the
kid
clever
nobody
else
would
have
thought
of
it
except
maybe
westfall
let
see
your
figures
um
m
according
to
that
we
within
an
hour
of
it
right
now
he
turned
to
the
pilot
and
sketched
rapidly
get
on
this
line
here
please
and
decelerate
so
that
the
catch
up
with
us
and
pass
the
word
to
the
lookouts
stevens
and
i
will
take
the
bow
plates
that
a
good
idea
he
went
on
to
stevens
as
they
took
their
places
at
main
and
auxiliary
lot
of
plunder
in
that
ship
instruments
boats
and
equipment
worth
millions
besides
most
of
the
junk
of
the
passengers
clothes
trunks
trinkets
and
there
bucko
thanks
chief
and
they
fell
silent
watching
the
instruments
carefully
and
from
time
to
time
making
computations
from
the
readings
of
the
acceleration
and
flight
meters
there
she
is
an
alarm
bell
had
finally
sounded
the
had
flared
out
into
space
and
upon
both
screens
there
shone
out
images
of
the
closely
clustered
wreckage
of
the
but
both
men
were
more
interested
just
then
in
the
mathematics
of
the
recovery
than
in
the
vessel
itself
missed
it
eight
minutes
of
time
and
eleven
divisions
on
the
scale
reported
stevens
not
so
good
not
so
bad
either
i
seen
worse
computation
thus
lightly
was
dismissed
a
mathematical
feat
which
a
few
years
earlier
before
the
days
of
computers
would
have
been
deemed
worthy
of
publication
in
the
philosophical
magazine
director
newton
was
called
in
and
it
was
decided
that
the
many
small
fragments
of
the
vessel
were
not
worth
saving
that
its
upper
half
was
all
that
they
should
attempt
to
tow
the
enormous
distance
back
to
tellus
the
pace
of
the
was
adjusted
to
that
of
the
floating
masses
and
tractor
beams
were
clamped
upon
the
undamaged
portion
of
the
derelict
and
upon
the
two
slices
from
the
nose
of
the
craft
a
couple
of
the
larger
fragments
of
wreckage
were
also
taken
to
furnish
metal
for
the
repairs
which
would
be
necessary
acceleration
was
brought
slowly
up
to
normal
and
the
cruiser
of
the
void
with
her
heavy
burden
of
inert
metal
resumed
her
interrupted
voyage
toward
europa
the
satellite
upon
which
the
passengers
and
crew
of
the
had
been
so
long
immured
on
she
bored
through
the
ether
detector
screens
full
out
and
greenly
scintillant
vorkulian
outlining
her
football
shape
in
weird
and
ghastly
light
unafraid
now
of
any
possible
surviving
of
the
hexans
but
if
the
hexans
detected
her
they
made
no
sign
perhaps
their
fleet
had
been
destroyed
utterly
perhaps
it
had
been
impressed
upon
even
their
fierce
minds
that
those
sparkling
green
screens
were
not
to
be
molested
with
impunity
the
satellite
was
reached
without
event
and
down
into
the
crater
landing
shaft
the
two
enormous
masses
of
metal
dropped
callisto
foremost
citizens
were
on
hand
to
welcome
the
terrestrial
rescuers
and
revelry
reigned
supreme
in
that
deeply
buried
europan
community
all
humanity
celebrated
the
callistonians
rejoiced
because
they
were
now
freed
from
the
oppression
of
the
hexan
hordes
because
they
could
once
more
extend
their
civilization
over
the
jovian
satellites
and
live
again
their
normal
lives
upon
the
surface
of
those
small
worlds
the
terrestrials
were
almost
equally
enthusiastic
in
the
reunion
that
marked
the
end
of
the
long
imprisonment
of
the
refugees
as
soon
as
the
hull
of
the
had
been
warmed
sufficiently
to
permit
inspection
its
original
passengers
were
allowed
to
visit
it
briefly
to
examine
and
to
reclaim
their
belongings
of
course
some
damage
had
been
done
by
the
cold
of
interplanetary
space
but
in
general
everything
was
as
they
had
left
it
stevens
and
nadia
were
among
the
first
permitted
aboard
they
went
first
to
the
control
room
where
stevens
found
his
bag
still
lying
behind
breckenridge
desk
where
he
had
thrown
it
when
he
first
boarded
the
vessel
then
they
made
their
way
up
to
nadia
stateroom
which
they
found
in
meticulous
order
and
spotless
in
its
cleanliness
there
is
neither
dust
nor
dirt
in
space
nadia
glanced
about
the
formal
little
room
and
laughed
up
at
her
husband
funny
is
it
sweetheart
how
little
we
know
what
to
expect
just
think
how
surprised
i
would
have
been
when
i
left
this
room
if
i
had
been
told
that
i
would
have
a
husband
before
i
got
back
to
it
breckenridge
first
thought
was
for
his
precious
triplex
automatic
chronometer
which
he
found
of
course
way
off
six
and
seconds
fast
having
corrected
the
timepiece
from
that
of
the
he
immersed
himself
in
the
other
delicate
instruments
of
his
department
and
he
was
easy
to
find
from
that
time
on
overcrowded
as
the
already
was
it
was
decided
that
the
original
complement
of
the
should
occupy
their
former
quarters
aboard
her
during
the
return
trip
to
this
end
corps
of
mechanics
set
to
work
upon
the
salvaged
hulk
heavy
metal
work
was
no
novelty
to
the
callistonian
engineers
and
mechanics
and
the
also
was
well
equipped
with
machines
and
men
thus
the
prow
was
welded
armored
insulating
were
built
along
the
stern
which
was
the
plane
of
hexan
cleavage
electrical
connections
were
restored
and
lastly
a
set
of
the
great
vorkulian
generators
absorbers
and
dissipators
was
installed
with
sufficient
accumulator
capacity
for
their
operation
director
newton
studied
this
installation
in
silence
for
some
time
then
went
in
search
of
brandon
i
had
considered
the
possibility
of
being
attacked
again
between
here
and
tellus
but
there
always
the
chance
he
admitted
if
you
think
that
there
is
any
danger
we
will
crowd
them
all
into
the
it
will
not
be
at
all
comfortable
but
it
will
be
better
than
having
any
more
of
us
killed
with
that
outfit
they
be
as
safe
as
we
will
the
scientist
assured
him
they
can
stand
as
much
grief
as
we
can
we
do
the
fighting
for
the
whole
outfit
from
here
and
anything
we
meet
will
have
to
take
us
before
they
can
touch
them
so
they
had
better
ride
it
there
where
they
have
passengers
accommodations
and
be
comfortable
as
to
danger
i
do
know
what
to
expect
they
may
all
be
gone
and
they
may
not
we
going
to
expect
trouble
every
meter
of
the
way
in
though
and
be
ready
for
it
everything
ready
and
thoroughly
tested
and
stream
of
power
flowing
into
the
from
the
cosmic
receptors
of
her
sister
ship
the
passengers
and
their
new
possessions
were
moved
into
their
former
quarters
there
was
a
brief
ceremony
of
farewell
the
doors
of
the
airlocks
were
closed
the
careful
was
gone
through
and
the
driving
projectors
of
the
lifted
both
great
vessels
up
the
shaft
slowly
and
easily
and
after
them
as
long
as
they
could
be
seen
stared
the
thousands
of
callistonians
who
thronged
the
great
floor
many
of
the
spectators
were
not
strictly
speaking
callistonians
at
all
they
were
really
europans
born
and
reared
in
that
hidden
city
which
was
to
have
been
the
last
stronghold
of
callisto
civilization
in
that
throng
were
hundreds
who
had
never
before
seen
the
light
of
the
sun
nor
any
of
the
glories
of
the
firmament
hundreds
to
whom
that
brief
glimpse
was
a
foretaste
of
the
free
and
glorious
life
which
was
soon
to
be
theirs
up
and
up
mounted
that
powerful
of
space
with
her
heavy
barge
falling
smoothly
upward
at
normal
acceleration
below
her
first
europa
then
mighty
jupiter
became
moons
growing
smaller
and
smaller
in
their
stateroom
nadia
supple
waist
writhed
in
the
curve
of
stevens
arm
as
she
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
with
sparkling
eyes
well
big
fellow
how
does
it
feel
to
be
out
of
a
job
or
are
you
going
over
there
every
day
on
a
tractor
beam
to
work
as
norman
suggested
not
on
your
sweet
young
life
he
exclaimed
norm
thought
he
was
kidding
somebody
but
it
registered
zero
it
gives
me
the
pip
to
loaf
around
when
there
a
lot
of
work
to
do
but
this
is
entirely
different
nothing
driving
us
now
and
a
fellow
entitled
to
at
least
one
honeymoon
during
his
life
and
what
a
honeymoon
this
is
going
to
be
little
spacehound
of
my
heart
nothing
to
do
but
love
you
all
the
way
from
here
to
tellus
whoopee
oh
there
a
couple
of
other
things
to
do
she
reminded
him
gaily
you
got
to
smoke
a
lot
of
good
cigarettes
i
must
eat
a
lot
of
delray
chocolates
and
we
both
really
should
catch
up
on
eating
fancy
cooking
speaking
of
eating
is
that
the
second
call
for
dinner
it
and
they
went
along
the
narrow
hall
toward
the
elevator
to
these

the
long
journey
was
to
seem
all
too
short
long
though
the
voyage
was
it
was
uneventful
the
occupants
of
the
two
vessels
were
in
constant
touch
with
each
other
by
means
of
the
communicators
and
there
was
also
much
visiting
back
and
forth
in
person
stevens
and
nadia
came
often
to
the
and
were
accompanied
frequently
by
verna
pickering
who
claimed
anew
her
ancient
right
of
kicking
around
under
foot
wherever
brandon
and
westfall
might
chance
to
be
and
at
such
times
general
crowninshield
was
practically
certain
to
appear
and
upon
days
when
the
beautiful
brunette
did
not
appear
the
commandant
generally
found
it
necessary
to
inspect
in
person
something
in
the
day
after
day
passed
and
even
the
new
and
detector
screens
of
the
remained
unresponsive
and
cold
day
after
day
the
plates
before
the
doubled
lookouts
and
observers
remained
blank
power
flowed
smoothly
and
unfailingly
into
the
cosmic
receptors
and
the
products
of
conversion
were
discharged
with
equal
smoothness
and
regularity
from
the
gigantic
driving
projectors
the
tractor
beam
held
its
heavy
burden
easily
and
the
generators
functioned
perfectly
and
finally
a
planet
began
to
loom
up
in
the
stern
lookout
plates
verna

irrepressible

in
the
control
room
of
the
quarreling
adroitly
with
brandon
and
deftly
flirting
with
crowninshield
glancing
into
the
control
screen
she
saw
the
planet
in
its
end
block
then
studied
the
instruments
briefly
we
heading

declared
with
conviction
i
thought
it
looked
that
way
yesterday
but
supposed
it
must
be
only
apparent
a
trick
of
piloting
or
something
about
the
orbit
i
thought
of
course
you
were
taking
us
back
home
but
you
ca
get
to
tellus
on
any
such
course
as
this
sure
not
brandon
replied
easily
certainly
it
mars
is
that
where
the
started
out
for
whoever
said
we
were
going

tellus
of
course
if
any
of
the
passengers
want
to
go
right
back
the
ipc
will
undoubtedly
furnish
transportation
but
paste
this

your
hat

future
reference

if
they

so

and
closer
they
approached
the
red
planet
swinging
around
in
a
wide
arc
in
order
to
make
their
course
coincide
exactly
with
