chapter
i
the
long
long
road
over
the
moors
and
up
into
the
forest
who
trod
it
into
being
first
of
all
man
a
human
being
the
first
that
came
here
there
was
no
path
before
he
came
afterward
some
beast
or
other
following
the
faint
tracks
over
marsh
and
moorland
wearing
them
deeper
after
these
again
some
lapp
gained
scent
of
the
path
and
took
that
way
from
field
to
field
looking
to
his
reindeer
thus
was
made
the
road
through
the
great
almenning
the
common
tracts
without
an
owner
the
man
comes
walking
toward
the
north
he
bears
a
sack
the
first
sack
carrying
food
and
some
few
implements
a
strong
coarse
fellow
with
a
red
iron
beard
and
little
scars
on
face
and
hands
sites
of
old
wounds
were
they
gained
in
toil
or
fight
maybe
the
man
has
been
in
prison
and
is
looking
for
a
place
to
hide
or
a
philosopher
maybe
in
search
of
peace
this
or
that
he
comes
the
figure
of
a
man
in
this
great
solitude
he
trudges
on
bird
and
beast
are
silent
all
about
him
now
and
again
he
utters
a
word
or
two
speaking
to
himself
eyah
well
well
so
he
speaks
to
himself
here
and
there
where
the
moors
give
place
to
a
kindlier
spot
an
open
space
in
the
midst
of
the
forest
he
lays
down
the
sack
and
goes
exploring
after
a
while
he
returns
heaves
the
sack
to
his
shoulder
again
and
trudges
on
so
through
the
day
noting
time
by
the
sun
night
falls
and
he
throws
himself
down
on
the
heather
resting
on
one
arm
a
few
hours
rest
and
he
is
on
the
move
again
eyah
well
moving
northward
again
noting
time
by
the
sun
a
meal
of
barley
cakes
and
goats
milk
cheese
a
drink
of
water
from
the
stream
and
on
again
this
day
too
he
journeys
for
there
are
many
kindly
spots
in
the
woods
to
be
explored
what
is
he
seeking
a
place
a
patch
of
ground
an
emigrant
maybe
from
the
homestead
tracts
he
keeps
his
eyes
alert
looking
out
now
and
again
he
climbs
to
the
top
of
a
hill
looking
out
the
sun
goes
down
once
more
he
moves
along
the
western
side
of
a
valley
wooded
ground
with
leafy
trees
among
the
spruce
and
pine
and
grass
beneath
hours
of
this
and
twilight
is
falling
but
his
ear
catches
the
faint
purl
of
running
water
and
it
heartens
him
like
the
voice
of
a
living
thing
he
climbs
the
slope
and
sees
the
valley
half
in
darkness
below
beyond
the
sky
to
the
south
he
lies
down
to
rest
the
morning
shows
him
a
range
of
pasture
and
woodland
he
moves
down
and
there
is
a
green
hillside
far
below
a
glimpse
of
the
stream
and
a
hare
bounding
across
the
man
nods
his
head
as
it
were
approvingly
the
stream
is
not
so
broad
but
that
a
hare
may
cross
it
at
a
bound
a
white
grouse
sitting
close
upon
its
nest
starts
up
at
his
feet
with
an
angry
hiss
and
he
nods
again
feathered
game
and
fur
a
good
spot
this
heather
bilberry
and
cloudberry
cover
the
ground
there
are
tiny
ferns
and
the
star
flowers
of
the
here
and
there
he
stops
to
dig
with
an
iron
tool
and
finds
good
mould
or
peaty
soil
manured
with
the
rotted
wood
and
fallen
leaves
of
a
thousand
years
he
nods
to
say
that
he
has
found
himself
a
place
to
stay
and
live
ay
he
will
stay
here
and
live
two
days
he
goes
exploring
the
country
round
returning
each
evening
to
the
hillside
he
sleeps
at
night
on
a
bed
of
stacked
pine
already
he
feels
at
home
here
with
a
bed
of
pine
beneath
an
overhanging
rock
the
worst
of
his
task
had
been
to
find
the
place
this
place
but
his
now
there
was
work
to
fill
his
days
he
started
at
once
stripping
birch
bark
in
the
woods
farther
off
while
the
sap
was
still
in
the
trees
the
bark
he
pressed
and
dried
and
when
he
had
gathered
a
heavy
load
carried
it
all
the
miles
back
to
the
village
to
be
sold
for
building
then
back
to
the
hillside
with
new
sacks
of
food
and
implements
flour
and
pork
a
a
spade
out
and
back
along
the
way
he
had
come
carrying
loads
all
the
time
a
born
carrier
of
loads
a
lumbering
barge
of
a
man
in
the
forest
oh
as
if
he
loved
his
calling
tramping
long
roads
and
carrying
heavy
burdens
as
if
life
without
a
load
upon
one
shoulders
were
a
miserable
thing
no
life
for
him
one
day
he
came
up
with
more
than
the
load
he
bore
came
leading
three
goats
in
a
leash
he
was
proud
of
his
goats
as
if
they
had
been
horned
cattle
and
tended
them
kindly
then
came
the
first
stranger
passing
a
nomad
lapp
at
sight
of
the
goats
he
knew
that
this
was
a
man
who
had
come
to
stay
and
spoke
to
him
you
going
to
live
here
for
good
ay
said
the
man
what
your
name
isak
you
do
know
of
a
woman
body
anywhere
come
and
help
no
but
i
say
a
word
of
it
to
all
i
meet
ay
do
that
say
i
creatures
here
and
none
to
look
to
them
the
lapp
went
on
his
way
isak
ay
he
would
say
a
word
of
that
the
man
on
the
hillside
was
no
runaway
he
had
told
his
name
a
runaway
he
would
have
been
found
only
a
worker
and
a
hardy
one
he
set
about
cutting
winter
fodder
for
his
goats
clearing
the
ground
digging
a
field
shifting
stones
making
a
wall
of
stones
by
the
autumn
he
had
built
a
house
for
himself
a
hut
of
turf
sound
and
strong
and
warm
storms
could
not
shake
it
and
nothing
could
burn
it
down
here
was
a
home
he
could
go
inside
and
shut
the
door
and
stay
there
could
stand
outside
on
the
the
owner
of
that
house
if
any
should
pass
by
there
were
two
rooms
in
the
hut
for
himself
at
the
one
end
and
for
his
beasts
at
the
other
farthest
in
against
the
wall
of
rock
was
the
hayloft
everything
was
there
two
more
lapps
come
by
father
and
son
they
stand
resting
with
both
hands
on
their
long
staves
taking
stock
of
the
hut
and
the
clearing
noting
the
sound
of
the
up
on
the
hillside
say
the
lapps
and
here
fine
folk
come
to
live
lapps
talk
that
way
with
flattering
words
you
do
know
of
any
woman
hereabouts
to
help
says
isak
thinking
always
of
but
one
thing
woman
to
help
no
but
we
say
a
word
of
it
ay
if
you
be
so
good
that
i
a
house
and
a
bit
of
ground
here
and
goats
but
no
woman
to
help
say
that
oh
he
had
sought
about
for
a
woman
to
help
each
time
he
had
been
down
to
the
village
with
his
loads
of
bark
but
there
was
none
to
be
found
they
would
look
at
him
a
widow
or
an
old
unmarried
one
or
so
but
all
afraid
to
offer
whatever
might
be
in
their
minds
isak
could
tell
why
could
tell
why
who
would
go
as
help
to
live
with
a
man
in
the
wilds
ever
so
many
miles
away
a
whole
day
journey
to
the
nearest
neighbour
and
the
man
himself
was
no
way
charming
or
pleasant
by
his
looks
far
from
it
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
no
tenor
with
eyes
to
heaven
but
a
coarse
voice
something
like
a
beast
well
he
would
have
to
manage
alone
in
winter
he
made
great
wooden
troughs
and
sold
them
in
the
village
carrying
sacks
of
food
and
tools
back
through
the
snow
hard
days
when
he
was
tied
to
a
load
there
were
the
goats
and
none
to
look
to
them
he
could
not
be
away
for
long
and
what
did
he
do
need
made
him
wise
his
brain
was
strong
and
little
used
he
trained
it
up
to
ever
more
and
more
his
first
way
was
to
let
the
goats
loose
before
starting
off
himself
so
that
they
could
get
a
full
feed
among
the
undergrowth
in
the
woods
but
he
found
another
plan
he
took
a
bucket
a
great
vessel
and
hung
it
up
by
the
river
so
that
a
single
drop
fell
in
at
a
time
taking
fourteen
hours
to
fill
it
when
it
was
full
to
the
brim
the
weight
was
right
the
bucket
sank
and
in
doing
so
pulled
a
line
connected
with
the
hayloft
a
opened
and
three
bundles
of
fodder
came
through
the
goats
were
fed
that
was
his
way
a
bright
idea
an
inspiration
maybe
sent
from
god
the
man
had
none
to
help
him
but
himself
it
served
his
need
until
late
in
the
autumn
then
came
the
first
snow
then
rain
then
snow
again
snowing
all
the
time
and
his
machine
went
wrong
the
bucket
was
filled
from
above
opening
the
trap
too
soon
he
fixed
a
cover
over
and
all
went
well
again
for
a
time
then
came
winter
the
drop
of
water
froze
to
an
icicle
and
stopped
the
machine
for
good
the
goats
must
do
as
their
master
learn
to
do
without
hard
times
the
man
had
need
of
help
and
there
was
none
yet
still
he
found
a
way
he
worked
and
worked
at
his
home
he
made
a
window
in
the
hut
with
two
panes
of
real
glass
and
that
was
a
bright
and
wonderful
day
in
his
life
no
need
of
lighting
fires
to
see
he
could
sit
indoors
and
work
at
his
wooden
troughs
by
daylight
better
days
brighter
days
eyah
he
read
no
books
but
his
thoughts
were
often
with
god
it
was
natural
coming
of
simplicity
and
awe
the
stars
in
the
sky
the
wind
in
the
trees
the
solitude
and
the
snow
the
might
of
earth
and
over
earth
filled
him
many
times
a
day
with
a
deep
earnestness
he
was
a
sinner
and
feared
god
on
sundays
he
washed
himself
out
of
reverence
for
the
holy
day
but
worked
none
the
less
as
through
the
week
spring
came
he
worked
on
his
patch
of
ground
and
planted
potatoes
his
livestock
multiplied
the
two
had
each
had
twins
making
seven
in
all
about
the
place
he
made
a
bigger
shed
for
them
ready
for
further
increase
and
put
a
couple
of
glass
panes
in
there
too
ay
was
lighter
and
brighter
now
in
every
way
and
then
at
last
came
help
the
woman
he
needed
she
tacked
about
for
a
long
time
this
way
and
that
across
the
hillside
before
venturing
near
it
was
evening
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
come
down
and
then
she
came
a
big
girl
and
coarse
with
good
heavy
hands
and
rough
hide
brogues
on
her
feet
as
if
she
had
been
a
lapp
and
a
calfskin
bag
slung
from
her
shoulders
not
altogether
young
speaking
politely
somewhere
nearing
thirty
there
was
nothing
to
fear
but
she
gave
him
greeting
and
said
hastily
i
was
going
cross
the
hills
and
took
this
way
that
was
all
ho
said
the
man
he
could
barely
take
her
meaning
for
she
spoke
in
a
slovenly
way
also
she
kept
her
face
turned
aside
ay
said
she
is
a
long
way
to
come
ay
it
that
says
the
man
cross
the
hills
you
said
yes
and
what
for
i
my
people
there
eh
so
you
your
people
there
and
what
your
name
inger
and
what
yours
isak
isak
h
live
here
yourself
maybe
ay
here
such
as
it
is
why
is
none
so
bad
said
she
to
please
him
now
he
had
grown
something
clever
to
think
out
the
way
of
things
and
it
struck
him
then
she
come
for
that
very
business
and
no
other
had
started
out
two
days
back
just
to
come
here
maybe
she
had
heard
of
his
wanting
a
woman
to
help
go
inside
a
bit
and
rest
your
feet
said
he
they
went
into
the
hut
and
took
a
bit
of
the
food
she
had
brought
and
some
of
his
goats
milk
to
drink
then
they
made
coffee
that
she
had
brought
with
her
in
a
bladder
settled
down
comfortably
over
their
coffee
until
bedtime
and
in
the
night
he
lay
wanting
her
and
she
was
willing
she
did
not
go
away
next
morning
all
that
day
she
did
not
go
but
helped
about
the
place
milked
the
goats
and
scoured
pots
and
things
with
fine
sand
and
got
them
clean
she
did
not
go
away
at
all
inger
was
her
name
and
isak
was
his
name
and
now
it
was
another
life
for
the
solitary
man
true
this
wife
of
his
had
a
curious
slovenly
way
of
speech
and
always
turning
her
face
aside
by
reason
of
a
that
she
had
but
that
was
no
matter
save
that
her
mouth
was
disfigured
she
would
hardly
have
come
to
him
at
all
he
might
well
be
grateful
for
that
she
was
marked
with
a
and
as
to
that
he
himself
was
no
beauty
isak
with
the
iron
beard
and
rugged
body
a
grim
and
surly
figure
of
a
man
ay
as
a
man
seen
through
a
flaw
in
the
his
look
was
not
a
gentle
one
as
if
barabbas
might
break
loose
at
any
minute
it
was
a
wonder
inger
herself
did
not
run
away
she
did
not
run
away
when
he
had
been
out
and
came
home
again
there
was
inger
at
the
hut
the
two
were
one
the
woman
and
the
hut
it
was
another
mouth
for
him
to
feed
but
no
loss
in
that
he
had
more
freedom
now
and
could
go
and
stay
as
he
needed
and
there
were
matters
to
be
looked
to
away
from
home
there
was
the
river
pleasant
to
look
at
and
deep
and
swift
besides
a
river
not
to
be
despised
it
must
come
from
some
big
water
up
in
the
hills
he
got
himself
some
fishing
gear
and
went
exploring
in
the
evening
he
came
back
with
a
basket
of
trout
and
char
this
was
a
great
thing
to
inger
and
a
marvel
she
was
overwhelmed
being
no
way
used
to
fine
dishes
she
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
out
why
wherever
and
she
was
not
slow
to
see
how
he
was
pleased
at
her
surprise
and
proud
of
it
for
she
said
more
in
the
same
strain
oh
she
had
never
seen
the
like
and
how
had
he
ever
managed
to
find
such
things
inger
was
a
blessing
too
in
other
ways
no
clever
head
nor
great
in
wit
maybe
but
she
had
two
lambing
ewes
with
some
of
her
kinsfolk
and
brought
them
down
it
was
the
best
they
could
have
wished
for
at
the
hut
sheep
with
wool
and
lambs
four
new
head
to
their
stock
about
the
place
it
was
growing
getting
bigger
a
wonder
and
a
marvel
how
their
stock
was
grown
and
inger
brought
more
clothes
and
little
trifles
of
her
own
a
and
a
string
of
pretty
glass
beads
a
and
why
if
she
went
on
that
gait
the
hut
would
soon
be
filled
from
floor
to
roof
and
no
room
for
more
isak
was
astonished
in
his
turn
at
all
this
wealth
of
goods
but
being
a
silent
man
and
slow
to
speak
he
said
nothing
only
shambled
out
to
the
and
looked
at
the
weather
and
shambled
in
again
ay
he
had
been
lucky
indeed
he
felt
himself
more
and
more
in
love
or
drawn
towards
her
or
whatever
it
might
be
you
no
call
to
fetch
along
all
such
stuff
said
he
tis
more
than
needed
i
more
if
i
like
to
fetch
it
and
there
uncle
sivert
besides
you
heard
of
him
no
why
he
a
rich
man
and
district
treasurer
besides
love
makes
a
fool
of
the
wise
isak
felt
he
must
do
something
grand
himself
and
overdid
it
what
i
was
going
to
say
you
no
need
to
bother
with
hoeing
potatoes
i
do
it
myself
the
evening
when
i
come
home
and
he
took
his
ax
and
went
off
to
the
woods
she
heard
him
felling
in
the
woods
not
so
far
off
she
could
hear
from
the
crash
that
he
was
felling
big
timber
she
listened
for
a
while
and
then
went
out
to
the
potato
field
and
set
to
work
hoeing
love
makes
fools
wise
isak
came
home
in
the
evening
hauling
a
huge
trunk
by
a
rope
oh
that
simple
and
innocent
isak
he
made
all
the
noise
he
could
with
his
and
coughed
and
hemmed
all
for
her
to
come
out
and
wonder
at
him
and
sure
enough
why
you
out
of
your
senses
said
inger
when
she
came
out
is
that
work
for
a
man
he
made
no
answer
would
have
said
a
word
for
anything
to
do
a
little
more
than
was
work
for
a
man
was
nothing
to
speak
of
nothing
at
all
a
stick
of
timber
huh
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
she
asked
oh
we
see
he
answered
carelessly
as
if
scarcely
heeding
she
was
there
but
when
he
saw
that
she
had
hoed
the
potatoes
after
all
he
was
not
pleased
it
was
as
if
she
had
done
almost
as
much
as
he
and
that
was
not
to
his
liking
he
slipped
the
rope
from
the
and
went
off
with
it
once
more
what
have
you
done
yet
no
said
he
gruffly
and
he
came
back
with
another
stick
like
the
last
only
with
no
noise
nor
sign
of
being
out
of
breath
hauled
it
up
to
the
hut
like
an
ox
and
left
it
there
that
summer
he
felled
a
mass
of
timber
and
brought
it
to
the
hut
chapter
ii
inger
packed
up
some
food
one
day
in
her
calfskin
bag
i
thought
of
going
across
to
see
my
people
just
how
they
faring
ay
said
isak
i
must
have
a
bit
of
talk
with
them
about
things
isak
did
not
go
out
at
once
to
see
her
off
but
waited
quite
a
while
and
when
at
last
he
shambled
out
looking
never
the
least
bit
anxious
never
the
least
bit
miserable
and
full
of
fear
inger
was
all
but
vanished
already
through
the
fringe
of
the
forest
hem
he
cleared
his
throat
and
called
will
you
be
coming
back
maybe
he
had
not
meant
to
ask
her
that
but
coming
back
why
what
in
your
mind
of
course
i
be
coming
back
h
so
he
was
left
alone
again
eyah
well
with
his
strength
and
the
love
of
work
that
was
in
him
he
could
not
idle
in
and
out
about
the
hut
doing
nothing
he
set
to
clearing
timber
felling
straight
good
sticks
and
cutting
them
flat
on
two
sides
he
worked
at
this
all
through
the
day
then
he
milked
the
goats
and
went
to
bed
sadly
bare
and
empty
now
in
the
hut
a
heavy
silence
clung
about
the
peat
walls
and
the
earthen
floor
a
deep
and
solemn
loneliness
and
were
in
their
place
the
beads
too
were
safe
as
they
had
been
stowed
away
in
a
bag
under
the
roof
inger
had
taken
nothing
of
her
belongings
but
isak
unthinkably
simple
as
he
was
grew
afraid
of
the
dark
in
the
light
summer
nights
and
saw
shapes
and
things
stealing
past
the
window
he
got
up
before
dawn
about
two
by
the
light
and
ate
his
breakfast
a
mighty
dish
of
porridge
to
last
the
day
and
save
the
waste
of
time
in
cooking
more
in
the
evening
he
turned
up
new
ground
to
make
a
bigger
field
for
the
potatoes
three
days
he
worked
with
spade
and
ax
by
turns
inger
should
be
coming
on
the
next
be
but
reasonable
to
have
a
platter
of
fish
for
her
when
she
came
but
the
straight
road
to
the
water
lay
by
the
way
she
would
come
and
it
might
seem
so
he
went
a
longer
way
a
new
way
over
the
hills
where
he
had
never
been
before
grey
rock
and
brown
and
strewed
about
with
bits
of
heavy
stone
heavy
as
copper
or
lead
there
might
be
many
things
in
those
heavy
stones
gold
or
silver
like
as
not
he
had
no
knowledge
of
such
things
and
did
not
care
he
came
to
the
water
the
fly
was
up
and
the
fish
were
biting
well
that
night
he
brought
home
a
basket
of
fish
that
inger
would
open
her
eyes
to
see
going
back
in
the
morning
by
the
way
he
had
come
he
picked
up
a
couple
of
the
heavy
little
stones
among
the
hills
they
were
brown
with
specks
of
dark
blue
here
and
there
and
wondrous
heavy
in
the
hand
inger
had
not
come
and
did
not
come
this
was
the
fourth
day
he
milked
the
goats
as
he
had
used
to
do
when
he
lived
alone
with
them
and
had
no
other
to
help
then
he
went
up
to
a
quarry
near
by
and
carried
down
stones
great
piles
of
carefully
chosen
blocks
and
flakes
to
build
a
wall
he
was
busy
with
no
end
of
things
on
the
fifth
evening
he
turned
in
to
rest
with
a
little
fear
at
his
heart
but
there
were
the
and
and
the
string
of
beads
sadly
empty
and
bare
in
the
hut
and
never
a
sound
the
hours
were
long
and
when
at
last
he
did
hear
something
like
a
sound
of
footsteps
outside
he
told
himself
that
it
was
fancy
nothing
more
eyah
footnote
literally
lord
god
the
word
is
frequently
used
as
here
in
a
sense
of
resignation
as
it
were
a
sigh
he
murmured
desolate
in
spirit
and
isak
was
not
one
to
use
words
lightly
there
was
the
tramping
of
feet
again
outside
and
a
moment
after
something
gliding
past
the
window
something
with
horns
something
alive
he
sprang
up
over
to
the
door
and
lo
a
vision
god
or
the
devil
muttered
isak
who
did
not
use
words
lightly
he
saw
a
cow
inger
and
a
cow
vanishing
into
the
shed
if
he
had
not
stood
there
himself
and
heard
it
inger
talking
softly
to
the
cow
in
the
shed
he
would
not
have
believed
but
there
he
stood
and
all
at
once
a
black
misgiving
came
into
his
mind
a
clever
wife
ay
a
manager
of
wonders
but
after
all
no
it
was
too
much
and
that
was
the
only
word
for
it
a
and
at
a
pinch
even
the
beads
perhaps
though
they
were
over
fine
to
be
come
by
in
any
way
proper
and
natural
but
a
cow
picked
up
straying
on
the
road
maybe
or
in
a
field
it
would
be
missed
in
no
time
and
have
to
be
found
inger
stepped
out
of
the
shed
and
said
with
a
proud
little
laugh
it
only
me
i
brought
my
cow
along
h
said
isak
it
was
that
made
me
so
long
i
could
go
but
softly
with
her
over
the
hills
and
so
you
brought
a
cow
said
he
yes
said
she
all
ready
to
burst
with
greatness
and
riches
on
earth
do
you
believe
me
perhaps
isak
feared
the
worst
but
made
no
sign
and
only
said
come
inside
and
get
something
to
eat
did
you
see
her
is
she
a
pretty
cow
ay
a
fine
cow
said
isak
and
speaking
as
carelessly
as
he
could
he
asked
where
get
her
her
name
goldenhorns
what
that
wall
to
be
for
you
been
building
up
here
you
work
yourself
to
death
you
will
oh
come
and
look
at
the
cow
now
wo
you
they
went
out
to
look
and
isak
was
in
his
underclothes
but
that
was
no
matter
they
looked
and
looked
the
cow
all
over
carefully
in
every
part
and
noted
all
the
markings
head
and
shoulders
buttocks
and
thighs
where
it
was
red
and
white
and
how
it
stood
how
old
think
she
might
be
asked
isak
cautiously
think
why
she
just
exactly
a
tiny
way
on
in
her
fourth
year
i
brought
her
up
myself
and
they
all
said
it
was
the
sweetest
calf
they
ever
seen
but
will
there
be
feed
enough
here
think
isak
began
to
believe
as
he
was
only
too
willing
to
do
that
all
was
well
as
for
the
feed
why
there
be
feed
enough
never
fear
then
they
went
indoors
to
eat
and
drink
and
make
an
evening
together
they
lay
awake
talking
of
cow
of
the
great
event
and
is
she
a
dear
cow
too
her
second
on
the
way
and
her
name
goldenhorns
are
you
asleep
isak
no
and
what
do
you
think
she
knew
me
again
knew
me
at
once
and
followed
me
like
a
lamb
we
lay
up
in
the
hills
a
bit
last
night
ho
but
she
have
to
be
tied
up
through
the
summer
all
the
same
or
she
be
running
off
a
cow
a
cow
where
she
been
before
asked
isak
at
last
why
with
my
people
where
she
belonged
and
they
were
quite
sorry
to
lose
her
i
can
tell
you
and
the
little
ones
cried
when
i
took
her
away
could
she
be
making
it
all
up
and
coming
out
with
it
so
pat
no
it
was
thinkable
it
must
be
true
the
cow
was
hers
ho
they
were
getting
with
this
hut
of
theirs
this
farm
of
theirs
why
good
enough
for
any
one
ay
they
as
good
as
all
they
could
wish
for
already
oh
that
inger
he
loved
her
and
she
loved
him
again
they
were
frugal
folk
they
lived
in
primitive
wise
and
lacked
for
nothing
let
go
to
sleep
and
they
went
to
sleep
and
wakened
in
the
morning
to
another
day
with
things
to
look
at
matters
to
see
to
once
again
ay
toil
and
pleasure
ups
and
downs
the
way
of
life
as
for
instance
with
those
timber
baulks
should
he
try
to
fit
them
up
together
isak
had
kept
his
eyes
about
him
down
in
the
village
with
that
very
thing
in
mind
and
seen
how
it
was
done
he
could
build
with
timber
himself
why
not
moreover
it
was
a
call
upon
him
it
must
be
done
had
they
a
farm
with
sheep
a
farm
with
a
cow
already
goats
that
were
many
already
and
would
be
more
their
live
stock
alone
was
crowding
them
out
of
the
turf
hut
something
must
be
done
and
best
get
on
with
it
at
once
while
the
potatoes
were
still
in
flower
and
before
the
haytime
began
inger
would
have
to
lend
a
hand
here
and
there
isak
wakes
in
the
night
and
gets
up
inger
sleeping
fine
and
sound
after
her
long
tramp
and
out
he
goes
to
the
cowshed
now
it
must
not
be
thought
that
he
talked
to
cow
in
any
obsequious
and
disgustful
flattery
no
he
patted
her
decently
and
looked
her
over
once
more
in
every
part
to
see
if
there
should
by
chance
be
any
sign
any
mark
of
her
belonging
to
strange
owners
no
mark
no
sign
and
isak
steals
away
relieved
there
lies
the
timber
he
falls
to
rolling
the
baulks
then
lifting
them
setting
them
up
against
the
wall
in
a
framework
one
big
frame
for
a
parlour
and
a
smaller
one
there
must
be
a
room
to
sleep
in
it
was
heavy
work
work
and
his
mind
being
set
on
it
he
forgot
the
time
there
comes
a
smoke
from
the
of
the
hut
and
inger
steps
out
and
calls
to
breakfast
and
what
are
you
busy
with
now
asked
inger
you
early
about
says
isak
and
that
was
all
ho
that
isak
with
his
secrets
and
his
lordly
ways
but
it
pleased
him
maybe
to
have
her
asking
and
wondering
and
curious
about
his
doings
he
ate
a
bit
and
sat
for
a
while
in
the
hut
before
going
out
again
what
could
he
be
waiting
for
h
says
he
at
last
getting
up
this
wo
do
ca
sit
here
idling
today
work
to
be
done
seems
like
you
building
says
inger
what
and
he
answered
condescendingly
this
great
man
who
went
about
building
with
timber
all
by
himself
he
answered
why
you
can
see
as
much
i
take
it
yes
yes
of
course
building
why
there
no
help
for
it
as
i
can
here
you
come
bringing
a
whole
cow
to
the
farm
that
means
a
cowshed
i
suppose
poor
inger
not
so
eternally
wise
as
he
as
isak
that
lord
of
creation
and
this
was
before
she
learned
to
know
him
and
reckon
with
his
way
of
putting
things
says
inger
why
it
never
a
cowshed
you
building
surely
ho
says
he
but
you
do
mean
it
i
i
thought
you
be
building
a
house
first
think
so
says
isak
putting
up
a
face
as
if
he
never
in
life
have
thought
of
that
himself
why
yes
and
put
the
beasts
in
the
hut
isak
thought
for
a
bit
ay
maybe
be
best
so
there
says
inger
all
glad
and
triumphant
you
see
i
some
good
after
all
ay
that
true
and
what
you
say
to
a
house
with
two
rooms
in
rooms
oh
why
be
just
like
other
folks
do
you
think
we
could
they
did
isak
he
went
about
building
notching
his
baulks
and
fitting
up
his
framework
also
he
managed
a
hearth
and
fireplace
of
picked
stones
though
this
last
was
troublesome
and
isak
himself
was
not
always
pleased
with
his
work
haytime
came
and
he
was
forced
to
climb
down
from
his
building
and
go
about
the
hillsides
far
and
near
cutting
grass
and
bearing
home
the
hay
in
mighty
loads
then
one
rainy
day
he
must
go
down
to
the
village
what
you
want
in
the
village
well
i
ca
say
exactly
as
yet
he
set
off
and
stayed
away
two
days
and
came
back
with
a
a
barge
of
a
man
surging
up
through
the
forest
with
a
whole
iron
stove
on
his
back
is
more
than
a
man
can
do
said
inger
you
kill
yourself
that
gait
but
isak
pulled
down
the
stone
hearth
that
did
look
so
well
in
the
new
house
and
set
up
the
in
its
place
is
every
one
has
a
said
inger
of
all
the
wonders
how
we
getting
on
haymaking
still
isak
bringing
in
loads
and
masses
of
hay
for
woodland
grass
is
not
the
same
as
meadow
grass
more
the
pity
but
poorer
by
far
it
was
only
on
rainy
days
now
that
he
could
spare
time
for
his
building
was
a
lengthy
business
and
even
by
august
when
all
the
hay
was
in
safely
stored
under
the
shelter
of
the
rock
the
new
house
was
still
but
done
then
by
september
this
do
said
isak
you
better
run
down
to
the
village
and
get
a
man
to
help
inger
had
been
something
poorly
of
late
and
did
run
much
now
but
all
the
same
she
got
herself
ready
to
go
but
isak
had
changed
his
mind
again
had
put
on
his
lordly
manner
again
and
said
he
would
manage
by
himself
no
call
to
bother
with
other
folk
says
he
i
can
manage
it
alone
is
more
than
one
man
work
says
inger
you
wear
yourself
out
just
help
me
to
hoist
these
up
says
isak
and
that
was
all
october
came
and
inger
had
to
give
up
this
was
a
hard
blow
for
the
must
be
got
up
at
any
cost
and
the
place
covered
in
before
the
autumn
rains
there
was
not
a
day
to
be
lost
what
could
be
wrong
with
inger
not
going
to
be
ill
she
would
make
cheese
now
and
then
from
the
goats
milk
but
beyond
that
she
did
little
save
shifting
goldenhorns
a
dozen
times
a
day
where
she
grazed
bring
up
a
basket
or
a
box
she
had
said
next
time
you
down
to
the
village
what
want
that
for
asked
isak
i
just
be
wanting
it
said
inger
isak
hauled
up
the
on
a
rope
inger
guiding
them
with
one
hand
it
seemed
a
help
just
to
have
her
about
bit
by
bit
the
work
went
on
there
was
no
great
height
to
the
roof
but
the
timber
was
huge
and
heavy
for
a
little
house
the
weather
kept
fine
more
or
less
inger
got
the
potatoes
in
by
herself
and
isak
had
the
roofing
done
before
the
rain
came
on
in
earnest
the
goats
were
brought
in
of
a
night
into
the
hut
and
all
slept
there
together
they
managed
somehow
they
managed
everyway
and
did
not
grumble
isak
was
getting
ready
for
another
journey
down
to
the
village
said
inger
very
humbly
do
you
think
perhaps
you
could
bring
up
a
basket
or
a
box
i
ordered
some
glass
windows
said
isak
and
a
couple
of
painted
doors
i
have
to
fetch
them
up
said
he
in
his
lordly
way
ay
well
then
it
no
great
matter
about
the
basket
what
did
you
want
with
a
basket
what
it
for
what
it
for
oh
have
you
eyes
in
your
head
isak
went
off
deep
in
thought
two
days
later
he
came
back
with
a
window
and
a
door
for
the
parlour
and
a
door
for
the
bedroom
also
he
had
hung
round
his
neck
in
front
a
and
full
of
provisions
to
boot
you
carry
yourself
to
death
one
day
said
inger
ho
indeed
isak
was
very
far
indeed
from
being
dead
he
took
out
a
bottle
of
medicine
from
his
pocket
naphtha
it
was
and
gave
it
to
inger
with
orders
to
take
it
regularly
and
get
well
again
and
there
were
the
windows
and
the
painted
doors
that
he
could
fairly
boast
of
he
set
to
work
at
once
fitting
them
in
oh
such
little
doors
and
secondhand
at
that
but
painted
up
all
neat
and
fine
again
in
red
and
white
was
almost
as
good
as
having
pictures
on
the
walls
and
now
they
moved
into
the
new
building
and
the
animals
had
the
turf
hut
to
themselves
only
a
lambing
ewe
was
left
with
cow
lest
she
should
feel
lonely
they
had
done
well
these
builders
in
the
waste
ay
was
a
wonder
and
a
marvel
to
themselves
chapter
ii
isak
worked
on
the
land
until
the
frost
act
in
there
were
stones
and
roots
to
be
dug
up
and
cleared
away
and
the
meadow
to
be
levelled
ready
for
next
year
when
the
ground
hardened
he
left
his
field
work
and
became
a
woodman
felling
and
cutting
up
great
quantities
of
logs
what
do
you
want
with
all
these
logs
inger
would
say
oh
they
be
useful
some
way
said
isak
as
though
he
had
no
plan
but
isak
had
a
plan
never
fear
here
was
virgin
forest
a
dense
growth
right
close
up
to
the
house
a
barrier
hedging
in
his
fields
where
he
wanted
room
moreover
there
must
be
some
way
of
getting
the
logs
down
to
the
village
that
winter
there
were
folk
enough
would
be
glad
of
wood
for
firing
it
was
sound
enough
and
isak
was
in
no
doubt
he
stuck
to
his
work
in
the
forest
felling
trees
and
cutting
them
up
into
logs
inger
came
out
often
to
watch
him
at
work
he
took
no
notice
but
made
as
if
her
coming
were
no
matter
and
not
at
all
a
thing
he
wished
for
her
to
do
but
she
understood
all
the
same
that
it
pleased
him
to
have
her
there
they
had
a
strange
way
too
of
speaking
to
each
other
at
times
could
you
find
things
to
do
but
come
out
here
and
get
stark
frozen
says
isak
i
well
enough
for
me
says
inger
but
i
ca
see
there
any
living
sense
in
you
working
yourself
to
death
like
you
do
ho
you
just
pick
up
that
coat
of
mine
there
and
put
it
on
you
put
on
your
coat
likely
indeed
i
no
time
to
sit
here
now
with
goldenhorns
ready
to
calve
and
all
h
calving
you
say
as
if
you
did
know
but
what
do
you
think
now
about
that
same
calf
let
it
stay
and
be
weaned
maybe
do
as
you
think
is
none
of
my
business
with
calves
and
things
well
be
a
pity
to
eat
up
calf
seems
to
me
and
leave
us
with
but
one
cow
on
the
place
do
seem
to
me
like
you
do
that
anyway
says
isak
that
was
their
way
lonely
folk
ugly
to
look
at
and
overfull
of
growth
but
a
blessing
for
each
other
for
the
beasts
and
for
the
earth
and
goldenhorns
calved
a
great
day
in
the
wilderness
a
joy
and
a
delight
they
gave
her
and
isak
himself
saw
to
it
there
was
no
stint
of
flour
though
he
had
carried
it
all
the
way
himself
on
his
back
and
there
lay
a
pretty
calf
a
beauty
like
her
mother
and
comically
bewildered
at
the
miracle
of
coming
into
the
world
in
a
couple
of
years
she
would
be
having
calves
of
her
own
be
a
grand
fine
cow
when
she
grows
up
said
inger
and
what
are
we
to
call
her
now
i
ca
think
inger
was
childish
in
her
ways
and
no
clever
wit
for
anything
call
her
said
isak
why
silverhorns
of
course
what
else
the
first
snow
came
as
soon
as
there
was
a
passable
road
isak
set
out
for
the
village
full
of
concealment
and
mystery
as
ever
when
inger
asked
his
errand
and
sure
enough
he
came
back
this
time
with
a
new
and
unthinkable
surprise
a
horse
and
sledge
nothing
less
here
foolishness
says
inger
and
you
not
stolen
it
i
suppose
stolen
it
well
found
it
then
now
if
only
he
could
have
said
is
my
horse
our
horse
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
only
hired
it
after
all
hired
horse
and
sledge
to
cart
his
logs
isak
drove
down
with
his
loads
of
firewood
and
brought
back
food
herrings
and
flour
and
one
day
he
came
up
with
a
young
bull
on
the
sledge
bought
it
for
next
to
nothing
by
reason
they
were
getting
short
of
fodder
down
in
the
village
shaggy
and
thin
no
ways
a
beauty
but
decently
built
for
all
that
and
wanted
no
more
than
proper
feed
to
set
it
right
and
with
a
cow
they
had
already
what
you
be
bringing
up
next
said
inger
isak
brought
up
a
host
of
things
brought
up
planks
and
a
saw
he
had
got
in
exchange
for
timber
a
grindstone
a
wafer
iron
tools
all
in
exchange
for
his
logs
inger
was
bursting
with
riches
and
said
each
time
what
more
things
when
we
cattle
and
all
a
body
could
think
of
they
had
enough
to
meet
their
needs
for
no
little
time
to
come
and
were
folk
what
was
isak
to
start
on
again
next
spring
he
had
thought
it
all
out
tramping
down
beside
his
loads
of
wood
that
winter
he
would
clear
more
ground
over
the
hillside
and
level
it
off
cut
up
more
logs
to
dry
through
the
summer
and
take
down
double
loads
when
the
snow
came
fit
for
sledging
it
worked
out
beautifully
but
there
was
another
matter
isak
had
thought
of
times
out
of
number
that
goldenhorns
where
had
she
come
from
whose
had
she
been
there
was
never
a
wife
on
earth
like
inger
ho
a
wild
thing
she
was
that
let
him
do
as
he
pleased
with
her
and
was
glad
of
it
but
suppose
one
day
they
were
to
come
for
the
cow
and
take
it
away
and
worse
maybe
to
come
after
what
was
it
inger
herself
had
said
about
the
horse
you
have
stolen
it
i
suppose
or
found
it
that
was
her
first
thought
yes
that
was
what
she
had
said
who
could
say
if
she
were
to
be
trusted
what
should
he
do
he
had
thought
of
it
all
many
a
time
and
here
he
had
brought
up
a
mate
himself
for
the
cow
for
a
stolen
cow
maybe
and
there
was
the
horse
he
would
have
to
return
again
a
pity
for
a
little
friendly
beast
and
grown
fond
of
them
already
never
mind
said
inger
comfortingly
why
you
done
wonders
already
ay
but
just
now
with
the
spring
coming
on
and
i
need
of
a
horse
next
morning
he
drove
off
quietly
with
the
last
load
and
was
away
two
days
coming
back
on
foot
the
third
day
he
stopped
as
he
neared
the
house
and
stood
listening
there
was
a
curious
noise
inside
a
child
crying
eyah
well
there
it
was
but
a
terrible
strange
thing
and
inger
had
never
said
a
word
he
stepped
inside
and
there
first
thing
of
all
was
the
the
famous
that
he
had
carried
home
slung
round
his
neck
in
front
there
it
was
hung
up
by
a
string
at
each
end
from
the
ceiling
a
cradle
and
a
bedplace
for
the
child
inger
was
up
pottering
about
she
had
milked
the
cow
and
the
goats
as
it
might
have
been
just
an
ordinary
day
the
child
stopped
crying
you
through
with
it
already
said
isak
ay
i
through
with
it
now
h
it
came
the
first
evening
you
were
gone
h
i
only
to
get
my
things
off
and
hang
up
the
cradle
there
but
it
was
too
much
for
me
like
and
i
had
to
lie
down
why
did
you
tell
me
before
why
i
could
say
to
a
minute
when
it
be
is
a
boy
ho
a
boy
and
i
ca
for
the
life
of
me
think
what
we
to
call
him
said
inger
isak
peeped
at
the
little
red
face
well
shaped
it
was
and
no
and
a
growth
of
hair
all
thick
on
the
head
a
fine
little
fellow
for
his
rank
and
station
in
a
isak
felt
himself
curiously
weak
the
rugged
man
stood
there
with
a
miracle
before
him
a
thing
created
first
of
all
in
a
sacred
mist
showing
forth
now
in
life
with
a
little
face
like
an
allegory
days
and
years
and
the
miracle
would
be
a
human
being
come
and
have
your
food
said
inger
isak
is
a
woodman
felling
trees
and
sawing
logs
he
is
better
off
now
than
before
having
a
saw
he
works
away
and
mighty
piles
of
wood
grow
up
he
makes
a
street
of
them
a
town
built
up
of
stacks
and
piles
of
wood
inger
is
more
about
the
house
now
and
does
not
come
out
as
before
to
watch
him
at
his
work
isak
must
find
a
pretext
now
and
then
to
slip
off
home
for
a
moment
instead
queer
to
have
a
little
fellow
like
that
about
the
place
isak
of
course
would
never
dream
of
taking
any
notice
was
but
a
bit
of
a
thing
in
a
and
as
for
being
fond
of
it
but
when
it
cried
well
it
was
only
human
nature
to
feel
just
a
little
something
for
a
cry
like
that
a
little
tiny
cry
like
that
do
touch
him
says
inger
with
your
hands
all
messed
up
with
resin
and
all
resin
indeed
says
isak
why
i
have
had
resin
on
my
hands
since
i
built
this
house
give
me
the
boy
let
me
take
him
there
he
as
right
as
can
be
early
in
may
came
a
visitor
a
woman
came
over
the
hills
to
that
lonely
place
where
none
ever
came
she
was
of
inger
kinsfolk
though
not
near
and
they
made
her
welcome
i
thought
i
just
look
in
she
says
and
see
how
goldenhorns
gets
on
since
she
left
us
inger
looks
at
the
child
and
talks
to
it
in
a
little
pitying
voice
ah
there
none
asks
how
he
getting
on
that
but
a
little
tiny
thing
why
as
for
that
any
one
can
see
how
he
getting
on
a
fine
little
lad
and
all
and
who
have
thought
it
a
year
gone
inger
to
find
you
here
with
house
and
husband
and
child
and
all
manner
of
things
is
no
doing
of
mine
to
praise
but
there
one
sitting
there
that
took
me
as
i
was
and
no
more
and
wedded
not
wedded
yet
no
i
see
we
see
about
it
the
time
this
little
man
to
be
christened
says
inger
we
have
been
wedded
before
but
could
come
by
it
getting
down
to
a
church
and
all
what
do
you
say
isak
wedded
says
isak
why
yes
of
course
but
if
as
you
help
us
oline
says
inger
just
to
come
up
for
a
few
days
in
the
off
time
once
and
look
to
the
creatures
here
while
we
away
ay
oline
would
do
that
we
see
it
no
loss
to
you
after
why
as
to
that
she
leave
it
to
them
and
you
building
again
i
see
now
what
that
be
for
is
there
built
enough
inger
sees
her
chance
and
puts
in
here
why
you
must
ask
him
about
that
i
not
to
know
building
says
isak
oh
is
nothing
to
speak
of
a
bit
of
a
shed
maybe
if
we
should
need
it
what
that
you
were
saying
about
goldenhorns
you
like
to
see
her
they
go
across
to
the
cowshed
and
there
cow
and
calf
to
show
and
an
ox
to
boot
the
visitor
nods
her
head
looking
at
the
beasts
and
at
the
shed
all
fine
as
could
be
and
clean
as
could
be
cleaner
trust
inger
for
looking
after
creatures
every
way
says
oline
isak
puts
a
question
goldenhorns
was
at
your
place
before
ay
from
a
calf
not
my
place
though
at
my
son
but
is
all
the
same
and
we
her
mother
still
isak
had
not
heard
better
news
a
long
while
it
was
a
burden
lighter
goldenhorns
was
his
and
inger
by
honest
right
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
half
thought
of
getting
rid
of
his
trouble
in
a
sorry
way
to
kill
off
the
cow
that
autumn
scrape
the
hide
bury
the
horns
and
thus
make
away
with
all
trace
of
cow
goldenhorns
in
this
life
no
need
for
that
now
and
he
grew
mightily
proud
of
inger
all
at
once
ay
inger
says
he
she
one
to
manage
things
that
true
there
not
her
like
nor
equal
to
be
found
was
a
poor
place
here
till
i
got
a
woman
of
my
own
as
you
might
say
why
is
but
natural
so
says
oline
and
so
this
woman
from
across
the
hills
a
creature
with
her
wits
about
her
and
by
name
oline
she
stayed
with
them
a
couple
of
days
and
had
the
little
room
to
sleep
in
and
when
she
set
out
for
home
she
had
a
bundle
of
wool
that
inger
had
given
her
from
the
sheep
there
was
no
call
to
hide
that
bundle
of
wool
but
oline
took
care
that
isak
should
not
see
it
then
the
child
and
isak
and
his
wife
again
the
same
world
again
and
the
work
of
the
day
with
many
little
joys
and
big
goldenhorns
was
yielding
well
the
goats
had
dropped
their
kids
and
were
yielding
well
inger
had
a
row
of
red
and
white
cheeses
already
stored
away
to
get
ripe
it
was
her
plan
to
save
up
cheeses
till
there
were
enough
to
buy
a
loom
oh
that
inger
she
knew
how
to
weave
and
isak
built
a
shed
he
too
had
a
plan
of
his
own
no
doubt
he
set
up
a
new
wing
built
out
from
the
side
of
the
turf
hut
with
double
panelling
boards
made
a
doorway
in
it
and
a
neat
little
window
with
four
panes
laid
on
a
roof
of
outer
boards
and
made
do
with
that
till
the
ground
thawed
and
he
could
get
turf
all
that
was
useful
and
necessary
no
flooring
no
walls
but
isak
had
fixed
up
a
box
partition
as
for
a
horse
and
a
manger
it
was
nearing
the
end
of
may
the
sun
had
thawed
the
high
ground
isak
roofed
in
his
shed
with
turf
and
it
was
finished
then
one
morning
he
ate
a
meal
to
last
for
the
day
took
some
more
food
with
him
shouldered
pick
and
spade
and
went
down
to
the
village
bring
up
three
yards
of
cotton
print
if
you
can
inger
called
after
him
what
do
you
want
with
that
said
isak
isak
was
long
away
it
almost
seemed
as
if
he
had
gone
for
good
inger
looked
at
the
weather
every
day
noting
the
way
of
the
wind
as
if
she
were
expecting
a
she
went
out
at
nighttime
to
listen
even
thought
of
taking
the
child
on
her
arm
and
going
after
him
then
at
last
he
came
back
with
a
horse
and
cart
shouted
isak
as
he
drew
up
shouted
so
as
to
be
heard
and
the
horse
was
well
behaved
and
stood
as
quiet
as
could
be
nodding
at
the
turf
hut
as
if
it
knew
the
place
again
nevertheless
isak
must
call
out
hi
come
and
hold
the
horse
a
bit
ca
you
out
goes
inger
where
is
it
now
oh
isak
have
you
hired
him
again
where
have
you
been
all
this
time
is
six
days
gone
where
think
i
be
had
to
go
all
sorts
of
ways
round
to
find
a
road
for
this
cart
of
mine
hold
the
horse
a
bit
ca
you
cart
of
yours
you
do
mean
to
say
you
bought
that
cart
isak
dumb
isak
swelling
with
things
unspoken
he
lifts
out
a
plough
and
a
harrow
he
has
brought
nails
provisions
a
grindstone
a
sack
of
corn
and
how
the
child
he
asks
child
all
right
have
you
bought
that
cart
that
what
i
want
to
know
for
here
have
i
been
longing
and
longing
for
a
loom
says
she
jestingly
in
her
gladness
at
having
him
back
again
isak
dumb
once
more
for
a
long
space
busied
with
his
own
affairs
pondering
looking
round
for
a
place
to
put
all
his
goods
and
implements
it
was
hard
to
find
room
for
them
all
but
when
inger
gave
up
asking
and
began
talking
to
the
horse
instead
he
came
out
of
his
lofty
silence
at
last
ever
see
a
farm
a
horse
and
cart
and
plough
and
harrows
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
since
you
want
to
know
why
i
bought
that
horse
and
cart
and
all
that
in
it
says
he
and
inger
could
only
shake
her
head
and
murmur
well
i
never
did
see
such
a
man
isak
was
no
longer
littleness
and
humility
he
had
paid
as
it
were
like
a
gentleman
for
goldenhorns
here
you
are
he
could
say
brought
along
a
horse
we
can
call
it
quits
he
stood
there
upright
and
agile
against
his
wont
shifted
the
plough
once
more
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
with
one
hand
and
stood
it
up
against
the
wall
oh
he
could
manage
an
estate
he
took
up
the
other
things
the
harrow
the
grindstone
a
new
fork
he
had
bought
all
the
costly
agricultural
implements
treasures
of
the
new
home
a
grand
array
all
requisite
appliances
nothing
was
lacking
h
as
for
that
loom
why
we
manage
that
too
i
dare
say
as
long
as
i
my
health
and
there
your
cotton
print
they
none
but
blue
so
i
took
that
there
was
no
end
to
the
things
he
brought
a
bottomless
well
rich
in
all
manner
of
things
like
a
city
store
says
inger
i
wish
oline
could
have
seen
all
this
when
she
was
here
just
like
a
woman
sheer
senseless
vanity
as
if
that
mattered
isak
sniffed
contemptuously
though
perhaps
he
himself
would
not
have
been
displeased
if
oline
had
been
there
to
see
the
child
was
crying
go
in
and
look
after
the
boy
said
isak
i
look
to
the
horse
he
takes
out
the
horse
and
leads
it
into
the
stable
ay
here
is
isak
putting
his
horse
into
the
stable
feeds
it
and
strokes
it
and
treats
it
tenderly
and
how
much
was
owing
now
on
that
horse
and
cart
everything
the
whole
sum
a
mighty
debt
but
it
should
all
be
paid
that
summer
never
fear
he
had
stacks
of
cordwood
to
pay
with
and
some
building
bark
from
last
year
cut
not
to
speak
of
heavy
timber
there
was
time
enough
but
later
on
when
the
pride
and
glory
had
cooled
off
a
little
there
were
bitter
hours
of
fear
and
anxiety
all
depended
on
the
summer
and
the
crops
how
the
year
turned
out
the
days
now
were
occupied
in
field
work
and
more
field
work
he
cleared
new
bits
of
ground
getting
out
roots
and
stones
ploughing
manuring
harrowing
working
with
pick
and
spade
breaking
lumps
of
soil
and
crumbling
them
with
hand
and
heel
a
tiller
of
the
ground
always
laying
out
fields
like
velvet
carpets
he
waited
a
couple
of
days
longer
there
was
a
look
of
rain
about
and
then
he
sowed
his
corn
for
generations
back
into
forgotten
time
his
fathers
before
him
had
sowed
corn
solemnly
on
a
still
calm
evening
best
with
a
gentle
fall
of
warm
and
misty
rain
soon
after
the
grey
goose
flight
potatoes
were
a
new
thing
nothing
mystic
nothing
religious
women
and
children
could
plant
them
that
came
from
foreign
parts
like
coffee
fine
rich
food
but
much
like
swedes
and
mangolds
corn
was
nothing
less
than
bread
corn
or
no
corn
meant
life
or
death
isak
walked
bareheaded
in
jesu
name
a
sower
like
a
with
hands
to
look
at
but
in
his
heart
like
a
child
every
cast
was
made
with
care
in
a
spirit
of
kindly
resignation
look
the
tiny
grains
that
are
to
take
life
and
grow
shoot
up
into
ears
and
give
more
corn
again
so
it
is
throughout
all
the
earth
where
corn
is
sown
palestine
america
the
valleys
of
norway
itself
a
great
wide
world
and
here
is
isak
a
tiny
speck
in
the
midst
of
it
all
a
sower
little
showers
of
corn
flung
out
fanwise
from
his
hand
a
kindly
clouded
sky
with
a
promise
of
the
faintest
little
misty
rain
chapter
iv
it
was
the
slack
time
between
the
seasons
but
the
woman
oline
did
not
come
isak
was
free
of
the
soil
now
he
had
two
scythes
and
two
rakes
ready
for
the
haymaking
he
made
long
bottom
boards
for
the
cart
for
getting
in
the
hay
and
procured
a
couple
of
runners
and
some
suitable
wood
to
make
a
sledge
for
the
winter
many
useful
things
he
did
even
to
shelves
he
set
up
a
pair
of
shelves
inside
the
house
as
an
excellent
place
to
keep
various
things
such
as
an
almanac
he
had
bought
one
at
last
and
ladles
and
vessels
not
in
use
inger
thought
a
deal
of
those
two
shelves
inger
was
easily
pleased
she
thought
a
great
deal
of
everything
there
was
goldenhorns
for
instance
no
fear
of
her
running
away
now
with
the
calf
and
bull
to
play
with
she
ran
about
in
the
woods
all
day
long
the
goats
too
were
thriving
their
heavy
udders
almost
dragging
on
the
ground
inger
made
a
long
robe
of
blue
cotton
print
and
a
little
cap
of
the
same
stuff
as
pretty
as
could
be
and
that
was
for
the
christening
the
boy
himself
watched
her
at
work
many
a
time
a
blessed
wonder
of
a
boy
he
was
and
if
she
was
so
bent
on
calling
him
eleseus
why
isak
supposed
she
must
have
her
way
when
the
robe
was
finished
it
had
a
long
train
to
it
nigh
on
a
yard
and
a
half
of
cotton
print
and
every
inch
of
it
money
spent
but
what
of
that
the
child
was
their
what
about
those
beads
of
yours
said
isak
if
as
they
ever
to
be
used
at
all
oh
but
inger
had
thought
of
them
already
those
beads
of
hers
trust
a
mother
for
that
inger
said
nothing
and
was
very
proud
the
beads
were
none
so
many
they
would
not
make
a
necklace
for
the
boy
but
they
would
look
pretty
stitched
on
the
front
of
his
cap
and
there
they
should
be
but
oline
did
not
come
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cattle
they
could
have
gone
off
all
three
of
them
and
come
back
a
few
days
later
with
the
child
properly
christened
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
matter
of
getting
wedded
inger
might
have
gone
by
herself
if
we
put
off
the
wedding
business
for
a
bit
said
isak
but
inger
was
loth
to
put
it
off
it
would
be
ten
or
twelve
years
at
least
before
eleseus
was
old
enough
to
stay
behind
and
look
to
the
milking
while
they
went
no
isak
must
use
his
brains
to
find
a
way
the
whole
thing
had
come
about
somehow
without
their
knowing
maybe
the
wedding
business
was
just
as
important
as
the
christening
how
should
he
know
the
weather
looked
like
drought
a
thoroughly
wicked
drought
if
the
rain
did
not
come
before
long
their
crops
would
be
burnt
up
but
all
was
in
the
hand
of
god
isak
made
ready
to
go
down
to
the
village
and
find
some
one
to
come
up
all
those
miles
again
and
all
that
fuss
just
to
be
wed
and
christened
ay
outlying
folks
had
many
troubles
great
and
small
at
last
oline
did
come
and
now
they
were
wedded
and
christened
everything
decently
in
order
they
had
remembered
to
have
the
wedding
first
so
the
child
could
be
christened
as
of
a
wedded
pair
but
the
drought
kept
on
and
the
tiny
cornfields
were
parched
those
velvet
carpets
parched
and
why
was
all
in
the
hand
of
god
isak
mowed
his
bits
of
meadow
there
was
little
grass
on
them
for
all
he
had
manured
them
well
that
spring
he
mowed
and
mowed
on
the
hillsides
farther
and
farther
out
mowing
and
turning
and
carting
home
loads
of
hay
as
if
he
would
never
tire
for
he
had
a
horse
already
and
a
farm
but
by
he
had
to
cut
the
corn
for
green
fodder
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
now
all
depended
on
the
potato
crop
what
was
that
about
potatoes
were
they
just
a
thing
from
foreign
parts
like
coffee
a
luxury
an
extra
oh
the
potato
is
a
lordly
fruit
drought
or
downpour
it
grows
and
grows
all
the
same
it
laughs
at
the
weather
and
will
stand
anything
only
deal
kindly
with
it
and
it
yields
again
not
the
blood
of
a
grape
but
the
flesh
of
a
chestnut
to
be
boiled
or
roasted
used
in
every
way
a
man
may
lack
corn
to
make
bread
but
give
him
potatoes
and
he
will
not
starve
roast
them
in
the
embers
and
there
is
supper
boil
them
in
water
and
there
a
breakfast
ready
as
for
meat
it
little
is
needed
beside
potatoes
can
be
served
with
what
you
please
a
dish
of
milk
a
herring
is
enough
the
rich
eat
them
with
butter
poor
folk
manage
with
a
tiny
pinch
of
salt
isak
could
make
a
feast
of
them
on
sundays
with
a
mess
of
cream
from
goldenhorns
milk
poor
despised
potato
a
blessed
thing
but
now
things
look
black
even
for
the
potato
crop
isak
looked
at
the
sky
unnumbered
times
in
the
day
and
the
sky
was
blue
many
an
evening
it
looked
as
if
a
shower
were
coming
isak
would
go
in
and
say
like
as
not
we
be
getting
that
rain
after
all
and
a
couple
of
hours
later
all
would
be
as
hopeless
as
before
the
drought
had
lasted
seven
weeks
now
and
the
heat
was
serious
the
potatoes
stood
all
the
time
in
flower
flowering
marvellously
unnaturally
the
cornfields
looked
from
a
distance
as
if
under
snow
where
was
it
all
to
end
the
almanac
said
nothing
almanacs
nowadays
were
not
what
they
used
to
be
an
almanac
now
was
no
good
at
all
now
it
looked
like
rain
again
and
isak
went
in
to
inger
we
have
rain
this
night
god
willing
is
it
looking
that
way
ay
and
the
horse
is
shivering
a
bit
like
they
will
inger
glanced
towards
the
door
and
said
ay
you
see
come
right
enough
a
few
drops
fell
hours
passed
they
had
their
supper
and
when
isak
went
out
in
the
night
to
look
the
sky
was
blue
well
well
said
inger
anyway
give
the
last
bit
of
lichen
another
day
to
dry
said
she
to
comfort
him
all
she
could
isak
had
been
getting
lichen
as
much
as
he
could
and
had
a
fine
lot
all
of
the
best
it
was
good
fodder
and
he
treated
it
as
he
would
hay
covering
it
over
with
bark
in
the
woods
there
was
only
a
little
still
left
out
and
now
when
inger
spoke
of
it
he
answered
despairingly
as
if
it
were
all
one
i
not
take
it
in
if
it
is
dry
isak
you
do
mean
it
said
inger
and
next
day
sure
enough
he
did
not
take
it
in
he
left
it
out
and
never
touched
it
just
as
he
had
said
let
it
stay
where
it
was
there
be
no
rain
anyway
let
it
stay
where
it
was
in
god
name
he
could
take
it
in
some
time
before
christmas
if
so
be
as
the
sun
had
burnt
it
all
up
to
nothing
isak
was
deeply
and
thoroughly
offended
it
was
no
longer
a
pleasure
and
a
delight
to
sit
outside
on
the
and
look
out
over
his
lands
and
be
the
owner
of
it
all
there
was
the
potato
field
flowering
madly
and
drying
up
let
the
lichen
stay
where
it
was
what
did
he
care
that
isak
who
could
say
perhaps
he
had
a
bit
of
a
sly
little
thought
in
his
mind
for
all
his
stolid
simpleness
maybe
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
after
all
trying
to
tempt
the
blue
sky
now
at
the
change
of
the
moon
that
evening
it
looked
like
rain
once
more
you
ought
to
have
got
that
lichen
in
said
inger
what
for
said
isak
looking
all
surprised
ay
you
with
your
nonsense
but
it
might
be
rain
after
all
there
be
no
rain
this
year
you
can
see
for
yourself
but
for
all
that
it
grew
curiously
dark
in
the
night
they
could
see
through
the
glass
window
that
it
was
darker
ay
and
as
if
something
beat
against
the
panes
something
wet
whatever
it
might
be
inger
woke
up
is
rain
look
at
the
but
isak
only
sniffed
rain
not
a
bit
of
it
do
know
what
talking
about
ah
it
no
good
pretending
said
inger
isak
was
pretending
ay
that
was
it
rain
it
was
sure
enough
and
a
good
heavy
shower
but
as
soon
as
it
had
rained
enough
to
spoil
lichen
it
stopped
the
sky
was
blue
what
did
i
say
said
isak
and
hard
the
shower
made
no
difference
to
the
potato
crop
and
days
came
and
went
the
sky
was
blue
isak
set
to
work
on
his
timber
sledge
worked
hard
at
it
and
bowed
his
heart
and
planed
away
humbly
at
runners
and
shafts
eyah
ay
the
days
came
and
went
and
the
child
grew
inger
churned
and
made
cheeses
there
was
no
serious
danger
folk
that
had
their
wits
about
them
and
could
work
need
not
die
for
the
sake
of
one
bad
year
moreover
after
nine
weeks
there
came
a
regular
blessing
of
rain
rain
all
one
day
and
night
and
sixteen
hours
of
it
pouring
as
hard
as
it
could
if
it
had
come
but
two
weeks
back
isak
would
have
said
it
too
late
now
as
it
was
he
said
to
inger
you
see
that
save
some
of
the
potatoes
ay
said
inger
hopefully
it
save
the
lot
you
see
and
now
things
were
looking
better
rain
every
day
good
thorough
showers
everything
looking
green
again
as
by
a
miracle
the
potatoes
were
flowering
still
worse
than
before
and
with
big
berries
growing
out
at
the
tops
which
was
not
as
it
should
be
but
none
could
say
what
might
be
at
the
roots
isak
had
not
ventured
to
look
then
one
day
inger
went
out
and
found
over
a
score
of
little
potatoes
under
one
plant
and
they
five
weeks
more
to
grow
in
said
inger
oh
that
inger
always
trying
to
comfort
and
speak
hopefully
through
her
it
was
not
pretty
to
hear
when
she
spoke
for
a
sort
of
hissing
like
steam
from
a
leaky
valve
but
a
comfort
all
the
same
out
in
the
wilds
and
a
happy
and
cheerful
soul
she
was
at
all
times
i
wish
you
could
manage
to
make
another
bed
she
said
to
isak
one
day
ho
said
he
why
there
no
hurry
but
still
they
started
getting
in
the
potatoes
and
finished
by
michaelmas
as
the
custom
is
it
was
a
middling
year
a
good
year
once
again
it
was
seen
that
potatoes
did
care
so
much
about
the
weather
but
grew
up
all
the
same
and
could
stand
a
deal
a
middling
year
a
good
year
well
not
perhaps
if
they
worked
it
out
exactly
but
that
they
could
do
this
year
a
lapp
had
passed
that
way
one
day
and
said
how
fine
their
potatoes
were
up
there
it
was
much
worse
he
said
down
in
the
village
and
now
isak
had
a
few
weeks
more
to
work
the
ground
before
the
frost
set
in
the
cattle
were
out
grazing
where
they
pleased
it
was
good
to
work
with
them
about
and
hear
the
bells
though
it
did
take
some
of
his
time
now
and
again
there
was
the
bull
mischievous
beast
would
take
to
butting
at
the
lichen
stacks
and
as
for
the
goats
they
were
high
and
low
and
everywhere
even
to
the
roof
of
the
hut
troubles
great
and
small
one
day
isak
heard
a
sudden
shout
inger
stood
on
the
with
the
child
in
her
arms
pointing
over
to
the
bull
and
the
pretty
little
cow
silverhorns
they
were
making
love
isak
threw
down
his
pick
and
raced
over
to
the
pair
but
it
was
too
late
by
the
look
of
it
the
mischief
was
done
oh
the
little
rascal
she
all
too
young
half
a
year
too
soon
a
child
isak
got
her
into
the
hut
but
it
was
too
late
well
well
says
inger
is
none
so
bad
after
all
in
a
way
if
she
waited
we
have
had
both
of
them
bearing
at
the
same
time
oh
that
inger
not
so
bright
as
some
maybe
yet
for
all
that
she
may
well
have
known
what
she
was
about
when
she
let
the
pair
loose
together
that
morning
winter
came
inger
carding
and
spinning
isak
driving
down
with
loads
of
wood
fine
dry
wood
and
good
going
all
his
debts
paid
off
and
settled
horse
and
cart
plough
and
harrow
his
very
own
he
drove
down
with
inger
goats
milk
cheeses
and
brought
back
woollen
thread
a
loom
shuttles
and
beam
and
all
brought
back
flour
and
provisions
more
planks
and
boards
and
nails
one
day
he
brought
home
a
lamp
as
true
as
i
here
i
wo
believe
it
says
inger
but
she
had
long
had
in
her
mind
about
a
lamp
for
all
that
they
lit
it
the
same
evening
and
were
in
paradise
little
eleseus
he
thought
no
doubt
it
was
the
sun
look
how
he
stares
all
wondering
like
said
isak
and
now
inger
could
spin
of
an
evening
by
lamplight
he
brought
up
linen
for
shirts
and
new
hide
shoes
for
inger
she
had
asked
for
some
too
for
the
wool
and
he
brought
them
then
one
day
he
came
back
with
a
clock
with
what
a
clock
this
was
too
much
for
inger
she
was
overwhelmed
and
could
not
say
a
word
isak
hung
it
up
on
the
wall
and
set
it
at
a
guess
wound
it
up
and
let
it
strike
the
child
turned
its
eyes
at
the
sound
and
then
looked
at
its
mother
ay
you
may
wonder
said
inger
and
took
the
child
to
her
not
a
little
touched
herself
of
all
good
things
here
in
a
lonely
place
there
was
nothing
could
be
better
than
a
clock
to
go
all
the
dark
winter
through
and
strike
so
prettily
at
the
hours
when
the
last
load
was
carted
down
isak
turned
woodman
once
more
felling
and
stacking
building
his
streets
his
town
of
for
next
winter
he
was
getting
farther
and
farther
from
the
homestead
now
there
was
a
great
broad
stretch
of
hillside
all
ready
for
tillage
he
would
not
cut
close
any
more
but
simply
throw
the
biggest
trees
with
dry
tops
he
knew
well
enough
of
course
what
inger
had
been
thinking
of
when
she
asked
for
another
bed
best
to
hurry
up
and
get
it
ready
one
dark
evening
he
came
home
from
the
woods
and
sure
enough
inger
had
got
it
over
another
boy
and
was
lying
down
that
inger
only
that
very
morning
she
had
tried
to
get
him
to
go
down
to
the
village
again
is
time
the
horse
had
something
to
do
says
she
eating
his
head
off
all
day
i
no
time
for
nonsense
said
isak
shortly
and
went
out
now
he
understood
she
had
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
and
why
surely
was
as
well
to
have
him
about
the
house
why
ca
you
ever
tell
a
man
what
coming
said
he
you
make
a
bed
for
yourself
and
sleep
in
the
little
room
said
inger
as
for
that
it
was
not
only
a
bedstead
to
make
there
must
be
bedclothes
to
spread
they
had
but
one
skin
rug
and
there
would
be
no
getting
another
till
next
autumn
when
there
were
wethers
to
kill
and
even
then
two
skins
would
not
make
a
blanket
isak
had
a
hard
time
with
cold
at
nights
for
a
while
he
tried
burying
himself
in
the
hay
under
the
tried
to
bed
down
for
himself
with
the
cows
isak
was
homeless
well
for
him
that
it
was
may
soon
june
would
be
in
july
a
wonderful
deal
they
had
managed
out
there
in
the
wilderness
house
for
themselves
and
housing
for
the
cattle
and
ground
cleared
and
cultivated
all
in
three
years
isak
was
building
again
what
was
he
building
now
a
new
shed
a
jutting
out
from
the
house
the
whole
place
rang
with
the
noise
as
he
hammered
in
his
nails
inger
came
out
now
and
again
and
said
it
was
trying
for
the
little
ones
ay
the
little
ones
go
in
and
talk
to
them
then
sing
a
bit
eleseus
he
can
have
a
bucket
lid
to
hammer
on
himself
and
it
only
while
i
doing
these
big
nails
just
here
at
the
got
to
bear
the
whole
only
planks
after
that
nails
as
gentle
as
building
dolls
houses
small
wonder
if
isak
hammered
and
thumped
there
stood
a
barrel
of
herrings
and
the
flour
and
all
kinds
of
in
the
stable
better
than
lying
out
in
the
open
maybe
but
the
pork
tasted
of
it
already
a
shed
they
must
have
and
that
was
clear
as
for
the
little
ones
they
get
used
to
the
noise
in
no
time
eleseus
was
inclined
to
be
ailing
somehow
but
the
other
took
nourishment
sturdily
like
a
fat
cherub
and
when
he
was
crying
he
slept
a
wonder
of
a
child
isak
made
no
objection
to
his
being
called
sivert
though
he
himself
would
rather
have
preferred
jacob
inger
could
hit
on
the
right
thing
at
times
eleseus
was
named
after
the
priest
of
her
parish
and
that
was
a
fine
name
to
be
sure
but
sivert
was
called
after
his
uncle
the
district
treasurer
who
was
a
man
with
neither
wife
nor
child
to
come
after
him
they
could
do
better
than
name
the
boy
after
him
then
came
spring
and
the
new
season
work
all
was
down
in
the
earth
before
whitsun
when
there
had
been
only
eleseus
to
look
after
inger
could
never
find
time
to
help
her
husband
being
tied
to
her
now
with
two
children
in
the
house
it
was
different
she
helped
in
the
fields
and
managed
a
deal
of
odd
work
here
and
there
planting
potatoes
sowing
carrots
and
turnips
a
wife
like
that
is
none
so
easy
to
find
and
she
had
her
loom
besides
at
all
odd
minutes
she
would
slip
into
the
little
room
and
weave
a
couple
of
spools
making
stuff
for
underclothes
for
the
winter
then
when
she
had
dyed
her
wools
it
was
red
and
blue
dress
material
for
herself
and
the
little
ones
at
last
she
put
in
several
colours
and
made
a
bedspread
for
isak
all
by
herself
no
fancy
work
from
inger
loom
useful
and
necessary
things
and
sound
all
through
oh
they
were
doing
famously
these
settlers
in
the
wilds
they
had
got
on
so
far
and
if
this
year
crops
turned
out
well
they
would
be
enviable
folk
no
less
what
was
lacking
on
the
place
at
all
a
hayloft
perhaps
a
big
barn
with
a
inside
but
that
might
come
in
time
ay
it
would
come
never
fear
only
give
then
time
and
now
pretty
silverhorns
had
calved
the
sheep
had
lambs
the
goats
had
kids
the
young
stock
fairly
swarmed
about
the
place
and
what
of
the
little
household
itself
eleseus
could
walk
already
walk
by
himself
wherever
he
pleased
and
little
sivert
was
christened
inger
by
all
signs
and
tokens
making
ready
for
another
turn
she
was
not
what
you
call
niggardly
at
bearing
another
child
oh
a
mere
nothing
to
inger
though
to
be
sure
she
was
proud
enough
of
them
when
they
came
fine
little
creatures
as
any
one
could
see
was
not
all
by
a
long
way
that
the
lord
had
blessed
with
such
fine
big
children
inger
was
young
and
making
the
most
of
it
she
was
no
beauty
and
had
suffered
all
her
girlhood
by
reason
of
the
same
being
set
aside
and
looked
down
on
the
young
men
never
noticed
her
though
she
could
dance
and
work
as
well
they
found
nothing
sweet
in
her
and
turned
elsewhere
but
now
her
time
had
come
she
was
in
full
flower
and
constantly
with
child
isak
himself
her
lord
and
master
was
earnest
and
stolid
as
ever
but
he
had
got
on
well
and
was
content
how
he
had
managed
to
live
till
inger
came
was
a
mystery
feeding
no
doubt
on
potatoes
and
goats
milk
or
maybe
venturesome
dishes
without
a
name
now
he
had
all
that
a
man
could
think
of
in
his
place
in
the
world
there
came
another
drought
a
new
bad
year
the
lapp
coming
by
with
his
dog
brought
news
that
folk
in
the
village
had
cut
their
corn
already
for
fodder
is
a
poor
look
out
said
inger
when
it
comes
to
that
ay
but
they
the
herring
a
fine
haul
is
said
your
uncle
sivert
he
going
to
build
a
country
house
why
he
was
none
so
badly
off
before
that
true
and
like
to
be
the
same
with
you
for
all
it
seems
why
as
to
that
thank
god
we
enough
for
our
little
needs
what
do
they
say
at
home
about
me
up
here
wags
his
head
helplessly
there
no
end
to
the
great
things
they
say
more
than
he
can
tell
a
fellow
like
all
the
lapps
if
as
you
care
for
a
dish
of
milk
now
you
only
to
say
so
says
inger
is
more
than
worth
your
while
but
if
you
a
sup
for
the
dog
here
milk
for
and
food
for
the
dog
lifts
his
head
suddenly
at
a
kind
of
music
inside
the
house
what
that
is
only
our
clock
says
inger
it
strikes
the
hours
that
way
inger
bursting
with
pride
the
lapp
wags
his
head
again
house
and
cattle
and
all
manner
of
things
there
nothing
a
man
could
think
of
but
you
that
thing
ay
we
much
to
be
thankful
for
is
true
i
forgot
to
say
there
oline
was
asking
after
you
oline
how
is
it
with
her
she
none
so
poorly
where
will
your
husband
be
now
he
be
at
work
in
the
fields
somewhere
they
say
he
not
bought
yet
says
the
lapp
carelessly
bought
who
says
so
why
is
what
they
say
but
who
he
to
buy
from
is
common
land
ay
is
so
and
sweat
of
his
brow
to
every
spade
of
it
why
they
say
is
the
state
owns
all
the
land
inger
could
make
nothing
of
this
ay
maybe
so
was
it
oline
said
so
i
do
well
remember
says
the
lapp
and
his
shifty
eyes
looked
all
ways
around
inger
wondered
why
he
did
not
beg
for
anything
always
begged
as
do
all
the
lapps
sits
scraping
at
the
bowl
of
his
clay
pipe
and
and
lights
up
what
a
pipe
he
puffs
and
draws
at
it
till
his
wrinkled
old
face
looks
like
a
wizard
runes
no
need
to
ask
if
the
little
ones
there
are
yours
says
he
flattering
again
they
as
like
you
as
could
be
the
living
image
of
yourself
when
you
were
small
now
inger
was
a
monster
and
a
deformity
to
look
at
was
all
wrong
of
course
but
she
swelled
with
pride
for
all
that
even
a
lapp
can
gladden
a
mother
heart
if
it
was
that
your
sack
there
so
full
i
find
you
something
to
put
in
it
says
inger
nay
is
more
than
worth
your
while
inger
goes
inside
with
the
child
on
her
arm
eleseus
stays
outside
with
the
lapp
the
two
make
friends
at
once
the
child
sees
something
curious
in
the
sack
something
soft
and
fluffy
and
wants
to
pat
it
the
dog
stands
alert
barking
and
whining
inger
comes
out
with
a
parcel
of
food
she
gives
a
cry
and
drops
down
on
the
what
that
you
got
there
what
is
it
tis
nothing
only
a
hare
i
saw
it
was
the
boy
wanted
to
look
dog
ran
it
down
this
morning
and
killed
it
and
i
brought
it
along
here
your
food
said
inger
chapter
v
one
bad
year
never
comes
alone
isak
had
grown
patient
and
took
what
fell
to
his
lot
the
corn
was
parched
and
the
hay
was
poor
but
the
potatoes
looked
like
pulling
through
once
more
bad
enough
all
things
together
but
not
the
worst
isak
had
still
a
season
yield
of
cordwood
and
timber
to
sell
in
the
village
and
the
herring
fishery
had
been
rich
all
round
the
coast
so
there
was
plenty
of
money
to
buy
wood
indeed
it
almost
looked
like
a
providence
that
the
corn
harvest
had
failed
for
how
could
he
have
threshed
it
without
a
barn
and
call
it
providence
there
no
harm
in
that
sometimes
there
were
other
things
not
so
easily
put
out
of
mind
what
was
it
a
certain
lapp
had
said
to
inger
that
summer
something
about
not
having
bought
buy
what
should
he
buy
for
the
ground
was
there
the
forest
was
there
he
had
cleared
and
tilled
built
up
a
homestead
in
the
midst
of
a
natural
wilderness
winning
bread
for
himself
and
his
asking
nothing
of
any
man
but
working
and
working
alone
he
had
often
thought
himself
of
asking
the
lensmand
footnote
officer
in
charge
of
a
small
district
about
the
matter
when
he
went
down
to
the
village
but
had
always
put
it
off
the
lensmand
was
not
a
pleasant
man
to
deal
with
so
people
said
and
isak
was
not
one
to
talk
much
what
could
he
say
if
he
went
what
had
he
come
for
one
day
that
winter
the
lensmand
himself
came
driving
up
to
the
place
there
was
a
man
with
him
and
a
lot
of
papers
in
a
bag
geissler
himself
the
lensmand
no
less
he
looked
at
the
broad
open
hillside
cleared
of
timber
smooth
and
unbroken
under
the
snow
he
thought
perhaps
that
it
was
all
tilled
land
already
for
he
said
why
this
is
a
whole
big
farm
you
got
you
do
expect
to
get
all
this
for
nothing
there
it
was
isak
was
and
said
not
a
word
you
ought
to
have
come
to
me
at
first
and
bought
the
land
said
geissler
ay
the
lensmand
talked
of
valuations
of
boundaries
taxes
taxes
to
the
state
and
when
he
had
explained
the
matter
a
little
isak
began
to
see
that
there
was
something
reasonable
in
it
after
all
the
lensmand
turned
to
his
companion
teasingly
now
then
you
call
yourself
a
surveyor
what
the
extent
of
cultivated
ground
here
he
did
not
wait
for
the
other
to
reply
but
noted
down
himself
at
a
guess
then
he
asked
isak
about
the
crops
how
much
hay
how
many
bushels
of
potatoes
and
then
about
boundaries
they
could
not
go
round
the
place
marking
out
in
snow
and
in
summer
no
one
could
get
up
there
at
all
what
did
isak
think
himself
about
the
extent
of
woodland
and
pasturage
isak
had
no
idea
at
all
he
had
always
thought
of
the
place
as
being
his
own
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
lensmand
said
that
the
state
required
definite
boundaries
and
the
greater
the
extent
the
more
you
will
have
to
pay
ay
and
they
wo
give
you
all
you
think
you
can
swallow
they
let
you
have
what
reasonable
for
your
needs
ay
inger
brought
in
some
milk
for
the
visitors
they
drank
it
and
she
brought
in
some
more
the
lensmand
a
surly
fellow
he
stroked
hair
and
looked
at
something
the
child
was
playing
with
playing
with
stones
what
let
me
see
h
heavy
looks
like
some
kind
of
there
plenty
such
up
in
the
hills
said
isak
the
lensmand
came
back
to
business
south
and
west
from
here
what
you
want
most
i
suppose
shall
we
say
a
couple
of
furlongs
to
the
southward
two
furlongs
exclaimed
his
assistant
could
till
two
hundred
yards
said
his
chief
shortly
what
will
that
cost
asked
isak
ca
say
it
all
depends
but
i
put
it
as
low
as
i
can
on
my
report
it
miles
away
from
anywhere
and
difficult
to
get
at
but
two
furlongs
said
the
assistant
again
the
lensmand
entered
duly
two
furlongs
to
the
southward
and
asked
what
about
the
hills
how
much
do
you
want
that
way
i
need
all
up
as
far
as
the
water
there
a
big
water
up
there
said
isak
the
lensmand
noted
that
and
how
far
north
why
it
no
great
matter
that
way
is
but
moorland
most
and
little
timber
the
lensmand
fixed
the
northward
boundary
at
one
furlong
east
that
no
great
matter
either
is
bare
field
all
from
here
into
sweden
the
lensmand
noted
down
again
he
made
a
rapid
calculation
and
said
it
make
a
place
even
at
that
anywhere
near
the
village
of
course
it
be
worth
a
lot
of
money
nobody
could
have
bought
it
i
send
in
a
report
and
say
a
hundred
would
be
fair
what
do
you
think
he
asked
his
assistant
it
giving
it
away
said
the
other
a
hundred
said
inger
isak
you
no
call
to
take
so
big
a
place
no
o
said
isak
the
assistant
put
in
hurriedly
that
just
what
i
say
it
miles
too
big
for
you
as
it
is
what
will
you
do
with
it
cultivate
it
said
the
lensmand
he
had
been
sitting
there
writing
and
working
in
his
head
with
the
children
crying
every
now
and
then
he
did
not
want
to
have
the
whole
thing
to
do
again
as
it
was
he
would
not
be
home
till
late
that
night
perhaps
not
before
morning
he
thrust
the
papers
into
the
bag
the
matter
was
settled
put
the
horse
in
he
said
to
his
companion
and
turning
to
isak
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
ought
to
give
you
the
place
for
nothing
and
pay
you
into
the
bargain
the
way
you
worked
i
say
as
much
when
i
send
in
the
report
then
we
see
how
much
the
state
will
ask
for
the
isak
it
was
hard
to
say
how
he
felt
about
it
half
as
if
he
were
not
after
all
to
find
his
land
valued
at
a
big
price
after
the
work
he
had
done
as
for
the
hundred
he
could
manage
to
pay
that
off
no
doubt
in
course
of
time
he
made
no
further
business
about
it
he
could
go
on
working
as
he
had
done
hitherto
clearing
and
cultivating
fetching
loads
of
timber
from
the
untended
woodlands
isak
was
not
a
man
to
look
about
anxiously
for
what
might
come
he
worked
inger
thanked
the
lensmand
and
hoped
he
would
put
in
a
word
for
them
with
the
state
yes
yes
but
i
no
say
in
the
matter
myself
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
say
what
i
have
seen
and
what
i
think
how
old
is
the
youngest
there
six
months
as
near
as
can
be
boy
or
girl
boy
the
lensmand
was
no
tyrant
but
shallow
and
not
overconscientious
he
ignored
his
assistant
brede
olsen
who
by
virtue
of
his
office
should
be
an
expert
in
such
affairs
the
matter
was
settled
out
of
hand
by
guesswork
yet
for
isak
and
his
wife
it
was
a
serious
matter
enough
ay
and
for
who
should
come
after
them
maybe
for
generations
but
he
set
it
all
down
as
it
pleased
him
making
a
document
of
it
on
the
spot
withal
a
kindly
man
he
took
a
bright
coin
from
his
pocket
and
gave
it
to
little
sivert
then
he
nodded
to
the
others
and
went
out
to
the
sledge
suddenly
he
asked
what
do
you
call
the
place
call
it
yes
what
its
name
we
must
have
a
name
for
it
no
one
had
ever
thought
of
that
before
inger
and
isak
looked
at
each
other
sellanraa
said
the
lensmand
he
must
have
invented
it
out
of
his
own
head
maybe
it
was
not
a
name
at
all
but
he
only
nodded
and
said
again
sellanraa
and
drove
off
settled
again
at
a
guess
anything
would
do
the
name
the
price
the
boundaries
some
weeks
later
when
isak
was
down
in
the
village
he
heard
rumours
of
some
business
about
lensmand
geissler
there
had
been
an
inquiry
about
some
moneys
he
could
not
account
for
and
the
matter
had
been
reported
to
his
superior
well
such
things
did
happen
some
folk
were
content
to
stumble
through
life
anyhow
till
they
ran
up
against
those
that
walked
then
one
day
isak
went
down
with
a
load
of
wood
and
coming
back
who
should
drive
with
him
on
his
sledge
but
lensmand
geissler
he
stepped
out
from
the
trees
on
to
the
road
waved
his
hand
and
simply
said
take
me
along
will
you
they
drove
for
a
while
neither
speaking
once
the
passenger
took
a
flask
from
his
pocket
and
drank
offered
it
to
isak
who
declined
i
afraid
this
journey
will
upset
my
stomach
said
the
lensmand
he
began
at
once
to
talk
about
isak
deal
in
land
i
sent
off
the
report
at
once
with
a
strong
recommendation
on
my
own
account
sellanraa
a
nice
name
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
ought
to
let
you
have
the
place
for
nothing
would
do
to
say
so
of
course
if
i
had
they
only
have
taken
offence
and
put
their
own
price
on
it
i
suggested
fifty
ho
fifty
you
said
not
a
hundred
the
lensmand
puckered
his
brow
and
thought
a
moment
as
far
as
i
recollect
it
was
fifty
yes
and
where
will
you
be
going
now
asked
isak
over
to
vesterbotten
to
my
wife
people
is
none
so
easy
that
way
at
this
time
of
year
i
manage
could
you
go
with
me
a
bit
ay
you
sha
go
alone
they
came
to
the
farm
and
the
lensmand
stayed
the
night
sleeping
in
the
little
room
in
the
morning
he
brought
out
his
flask
again
and
remarked
i
sure
this
journey
going
to
upset
my
stomach
for
the
rest
he
was
much
the
same
as
last
time
kindly
decisive
but
fussy
and
little
concerned
about
his
own
affairs
possibly
it
might
not
be
so
bad
after
all
isak
ventured
to
point
out
that
the
hillside
was
not
all
under
cultivation
yet
but
only
some
small
squares
here
and
there
the
lensmand
took
the
information
in
a
curious
fashion
i
knew
that
well
enough
of
course
last
time
i
was
here
when
i
made
out
the
report
but
brede
the
fellow
who
was
with
me
he
did
see
it
brede
he
no
earthly
good
but
they
work
it
out
by
table
with
all
the
ground
as
i
entered
it
and
only
so
few
loads
of
hay
so
few
bushels
of
potatoes
they
say
at
once
that
it
must
be
poor
soil
cheap
soil
you
understand
i
did
my
best
for
you
and
you
take
my
word
for
it
that
do
the
trick
it
two
and
thirty
thousand
fellows
of
your
stamp
the
country
wants
the
lensmand
nodded
and
turned
to
inger
how
old
the
youngest
he
just
of
a
year
and
a
boy
is
he
yes
but
you
must
see
and
get
that
business
settled
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
said
he
to
isak
again
there
another
man
wants
to
purchase
now
midway
between
here
and
the
village
and
as
soon
as
he
does
this
be
worth
more
you
buy
now
get
the
place
first
and
let
the
price
go
up
after
that
way
you
be
getting
some
return
for
all
the
work
you
put
into
it
it
was
you
that
started
cultivating
here
at
all
was
all
wilderness
before
they
were
grateful
for
his
advice
and
asked
if
it
was
not
he
himself
that
would
arrange
the
matter
he
answered
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
everything
now
depended
on
the
state
i
going
across
to
vesterbotten
now
and
i
sha
be
coming
back
he
told
them
straightforwardly
he
gave
inger
an
and
that
was
overmuch
you
can
take
a
bit
of
meat
down
to
my
people
in
the
village
next
time
you
killing
said
he
my
wife
pay
you
take
a
cheese
or
so
too
any
time
you
can
the
children
like
it
isak
went
with
him
up
over
the
hills
it
was
firm
good
going
on
the
higher
ground
easier
than
below
isak
received
a
whole
in
that
manner
was
it
lensmand
geissler
left
the
place
and
he
did
not
come
back
no
great
loss
folk
said
he
being
looked
on
as
a
doubtful
personage
an
adventurer
not
that
he
had
the
knowledge
he
was
a
learned
man
and
had
studied
this
and
that
but
he
lived
too
freely
and
spent
other
people
money
it
came
out
later
that
he
had
left
the
place
after
a
sharp
reprimand
from
his
superior
amtmand
pleym
but
nothing
was
done
about
his
family
officially
and
they
went
on
living
there
a
good
while
after
his
wife
and
three
children
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
money
unaccounted
for
was
sent
from
sweden
so
that
geissler
wife
and
children
could
not
be
said
to
be
held
as
hostages
but
stayed
on
simply
because
it
pleased
them
isak
and
inger
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
geissler
dealings
with
them
not
by
a
long
way
and
there
was
no
saying
what
sort
of
man
his
successor
would
be
perhaps
they
would
have
to
go
over
the
whole
business
again
the
amtmand
footnote
governor
of
a
country
sent
one
of
his
clerks
up
to
the
village
to
be
the
new
lensmand
he
was
a
man
about
forty
son
of
a
local
magistrate
by
name
heyerdahl
he
had
lacked
the
means
to
go
to
the
university
and
enter
the
service
that
way
instead
he
had
been
constrained
to
sit
in
an
office
writing
at
a
desk
for
fifteen
years
he
was
unmarried
having
never
been
able
to
afford
a
wife
his
chief
amtmand
pleym
had
inherited
him
from
his
predecessor
and
paid
him
the
same
miserable
wage
that
had
been
given
before
heyerdahl
took
it
and
went
on
writing
at
his
desk
as
before
isak
plucked
up
his
courage
and
went
to
see
him
documents
in
the
sellanraa
case
here
they
are
just
returned
from
the
department
they
want
to
know
all
sorts
of
things
the
whole
business
is
in
a
dreadful
muddle
as
geissler
left
it
said
the
official
the
department
wishes
to
be
informed
as
to
whether
any
considerable
crop
of
marketable
berries
is
to
be
reckoned
with
on
the
estate
whether
there
is
any
heavy
timber
whether
possibly
there
may
be
ores
or
metals
of
value
an
the
hills
adjoining
mention
is
made
of
water
but
nothing
stated
as
to
any
fishery
in
the
same
this
geissler
appears
to
have
furnished
certain
information
but
he
not
to
be
trusted
and
here
have
i
to
go
through
the
whole
affair
again
after
him
i
shall
have
to
come
up
to
sellanraa
and
make
a
thorough
inspection
and
valuation
how
many
miles
is
it
up
there
the
department
of
course
requires
that
adequate
boundaries
be
drawn
yes
we
shall
have
to
beat
the
bounds
in
due
order
is
no
light
business
setting
up
boundaries
this
time
of
year
said
isak
not
till
later
on
in
the
summer
anyhow
it
have
to
be
done
the
department
ca
wait
all
through
the
summer
for
an
answer
i
come
up
myself
as
soon
as
i
can
get
away
i
shall
have
to
be
out
that
way
in
any
case
there
another
plot
of
land
a
man
inquiring
about
will
that
be
him
that
going
to
buy
up
between
me
and
the
village
ca
say
i
sure
very
likely
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
a
man
from
the
office
here
my
assistant
in
the
office
he
was
here
in
geissler
time
asked
geissler
about
it
i
understand
but
geissler
put
him
off
said
he
could
cultivate
a
hundred
yards
of
land
so
he
sent
in
an
application
to
the
amtmand
and
i
instructed
to
see
the
matter
through
more
of
geissler
muddling
lensmand
heyerdahl
came
up
to
the
farm
and
brought
with
him
his
assistant
brede
they
had
got
thoroughly
wet
crossing
the
moors
and
wetter
still
they
were
before
they
finished
tramping
the
boundary
lines
through
melting
snow
and
slush
up
and
down
the
hills
the
lensmand
set
to
work
zealously
the
first
day
but
on
the
second
he
had
had
enough
and
contented
himself
with
standing
still
for
the
most
part
pointing
and
shouting
directions
there
was
no
further
talk
about
prospecting
for
ore
in
the
adjoining
hills
and
as
for
marketable
berries
they
would
have
a
look
at
the
moors
on
the
way
back
he
said
the
department
requested
information
on
quite
a
number
of
points
there
were
tables
for
all
sorts
of
things
no
doubt
the
only
thing
that
seemed
reasonable
was
the
question
of
timber
certainly
there
was
some
heavy
timber
and
that
within
the
limits
of
proposed
holding
but
not
enough
to
reckon
with
for
sale
no
more
than
would
be
required
to
keep
up
the
place
even
if
there
had
been
timber
in
plenty
who
was
to
carry
it
all
the
many
miles
to
where
it
could
be
sold
only
isak
trundling
like
a
through
the
forest
in
carting
some
few
heavy
sticks
down
to
the
village
to
bring
back
planks
and
boards
for
his
building
geissler
the
incomprehensible
had
it
seemed
sent
in
a
report
which
was
not
easily
upset
here
was
his
successor
going
through
the
whole
thing
again
trying
to
find
mistakes
and
blatant
inaccuracies
but
all
in
vain
it
was
noticeable
that
he
consulted
his
assistant
at
every
turn
and
paid
heed
to
what
he
said
which
was
not
geissler
way
at
all
that
same
assistant
moreover
must
presumably
have
altered
his
own
opinion
since
he
was
now
a
purchaser
himself
of
lands
from
the
common
ground
held
by
the
state
what
about
the
price
asked
the
lensmand
fifty
is
the
most
they
can
fairly
ask
of
any
buyer
answered
the
expert
lensmand
heyerdahl
drew
up
his
report
in
elegant
phrasing
geissler
had
written
the
man
will
also
have
to
pay
land
tax
every
year
he
can
not
afford
to
pay
more
for
the
place
than
fifty
in
annual
instalments
over
ten
years
the
state
can
accept
his
offer
or
take
away
his
land
and
the
fruits
of
his
work
heyerdahl
wrote
he
now
humbly
begs
to
submit
this
application
to
the
department
that
he
be
allowed
to
retain
this
land
upon
which
albeit
without
right
of
possession
he
has
up
to
this
present
effected
considerable
improvements
for
a
purchase
price
of
fifty
the
amount
to
be
paid
in
annual
instalments
as
may
seem
fit
to
the
department
to
apportion
the
same
lensmand
heyerdahl
promised
isak
to
do
his
best
i
hope
to
succeed
in
procuring
you
possession
of
the
estate
he
said
chapter
vi
the
big
bull
is
to
be
sent
away
it
has
grown
to
an
enormous
beast
and
costs
too
much
to
feed
isak
is
taking
it
down
to
the
village
to
bring
up
a
suitable
yearling
in
exchange
it
was
inger
idea
and
inger
had
no
doubt
her
own
reasons
for
getting
isak
out
of
the
place
on
that
particular
day
if
you
are
going
at
all
you
better
go
today
she
said
the
bull
in
fine
condition
fetch
a
good
price
at
this
time
of
year
you
take
him
down
to
the
village
and
they
send
him
to
be
sold
in
town
townsfolk
pay
anything
for
their
meat
ay
says
isak
if
only
the
beast
does
make
trouble
on
the
way
down
isak
made
no
answer
but
he
been
out
and
about
now
this
last
week
and
getting
used
to
things
isak
was
silent
he
took
a
big
knife
hung
it
in
a
sheath
at
his
waist
and
led
out
the
bull
a
mighty
beast
it
was
and
terrible
to
look
at
swaying
at
the
buttocks
as
it
walked
a
trifle
short
in
the
leg
when
it
ran
it
crushed
down
the
undergrowth
with
its
chest
it
was
like
a
railway
engine
its
neck
was
huge
almost
to
deformity
there
was
the
strength
of
an
elephant
in
that
neck
if
only
he
does
get
mad
with
you
said
inger
isak
thought
for
a
moment
why
if
as
he
takes
it
that
way
i
just
have
to
slaughter
him
and
carry
down
the
meat
inger
sat
down
on
the
she
was
in
pain
her
face
was
aflame
she
had
kept
her
feet
till
isak
was
gone
now
he
and
the
bull
were
out
of
sight
and
she
could
give
way
to
a
groan
without
fear
little
eleseus
can
talk
a
little
already
he
asks
mama
hurt
yes
hurt
he
mimics
her
pressing
his
hands
to
his
sides
and
groaning
little
sivert
is
asleep
inger
takes
eleseus
inside
the
house
gives
him
some
things
to
play
with
on
the
floor
and
gets
into
bed
herself
her
time
was
come
she
is
perfectly
conscious
all
the
while
keeps
an
eye
on
eleseus
glances
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
to
see
the
time
never
a
cry
hardly
a
movement
the
struggle
is
in
her
vitals
a
burden
is
loosened
and
glides
from
her
almost
at
the
same
moment
she
hears
a
strange
cry
in
the
bed
a
blessed
little
voice
poor
thing
poor
little
thing
and
now
she
can
not
rest
but
lifts
herself
up
and
looks
down
what
is
it
her
face
is
grey
and
blank
in
a
moment
without
expression
or
intelligence
a
groan
is
heard
unnatural
impossible
a
choking
gasp
she
slips
back
on
the
bed
a
minute
passes
she
can
not
rest
the
little
cry
down
there
in
the
bed
grows
louder
she
raises
herself
once
more
and
sees
o
god
the
direst
of
all
no
mercy
no
hope
and
this
a
girl
isak
could
not
have
gone
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
it
was
hardly
an
hour
since
he
had
left
in
less
than
ten
minutes
inger
had
borne
her
child
and
killed
it
isak
came
back
on
the
third
day
leading
a
yearling
bull
the
beast
could
hardly
walk
it
had
been
a
long
business
getting
up
to
the
place
at
all
how
did
you
get
on
asked
inger
she
herself
was
ill
and
miserable
enough
isak
had
managed
very
well
true
the
big
bull
had
been
mad
the
last
two
miles
or
so
and
he
had
to
tie
it
up
and
fetch
help
from
the
village
then
when
he
got
back
it
had
broken
loose
and
took
a
deal
of
time
to
find
but
he
had
managed
somehow
and
had
sold
for
a
good
price
to
a
trader
in
the
village
buying
up
for
butchers
in
the
town
and
here
the
new
one
said
isak
let
the
children
come
and
look
any
addition
to
the
live
stock
was
a
great
event
inger
looked
at
the
bull
and
felt
it
over
asked
what
it
had
cost
little
sivert
was
allowed
to
sit
on
its
back
i
shall
miss
the
big
one
though
said
inger
so
glossy
and
fine
he
was
i
do
hope
they
kill
him
nicely
it
was
the
busy
season
now
and
there
was
work
enough
the
animals
were
let
loose
in
the
empty
shed
were
cases
and
bins
of
potatoes
left
to
grow
isak
sowed
more
corn
this
year
than
last
and
did
all
he
could
to
get
it
nicely
down
he
made
beds
for
carrots
and
turnips
and
inger
sowed
the
seeds
all
went
on
as
before
inger
went
about
for
some
time
with
a
bag
of
hay
under
her
dress
to
hide
any
change
in
her
figure
taking
out
a
little
from
time
to
time
and
finally
discarding
the
bag
altogether
at
last
one
day
isak
noticed
something
and
asked
in
surprise
why
how
this
has
anything
happened
i
thought
no
not
this
time
ho
why
what
was
wrong
was
meant
to
be
so
i
suppose
isak
how
long
think
take
you
to
work
over
all
this
land
of
ours
yes
but
you
mean
you
had
your
trouble
did
go
as
it
should
ay
that
was
it
yes
but
yourself
you
not
hurt
anyway
after
it
no
isak
i
been
thinking
we
ought
to
have
a
pig
isak
was
not
quick
to
change
the
subject
that
way
he
was
silent
a
little
then
at
last
he
said
ay
a
pig
i
thought
of
that
myself
each
spring
but
we
need
to
have
more
potatoes
first
and
more
of
the
small
and
a
bit
of
corn
beside
we
not
enough
to
feed
a
pig
we
see
how
this
year
turns
out
but
it
would
be
nice
to
have
a
pig
ay
days
pass
rain
comes
fields
and
meadows
are
looking
well
oh
the
year
will
turn
out
well
never
fear
little
happenings
and
big
all
in
their
turn
food
sleep
and
work
sundays
with
washing
of
faces
and
combing
of
hair
and
isak
sitting
about
in
a
new
red
shirt
of
weaving
and
sewing
then
an
event
a
happening
of
note
in
the
ordinary
round
a
sheep
roaming
with
her
lamb
gets
caught
in
a
cleft
among
the
rocks
the
others
come
home
in
the
evening
inger
at
once
sees
there
are
two
missing
and
out
goes
isak
in
search
isak
first
thought
is
to
be
thankful
it
is
sunday
so
he
is
not
called
away
from
his
work
and
losing
time
he
tramps
off
there
is
an
endless
range
of
ground
to
be
searched
and
meanwhile
the
house
is
all
anxiety
mother
hushes
the
children
with
brief
words
there
are
two
sheep
missing
and
they
must
be
good
all
share
the
feeling
what
has
happened
is
a
matter
for
the
whole
little
community
even
the
cows
know
that
something
unusual
is
going
on
and
give
tongue
in
their
own
fashion
for
inger
goes
out
every
now
and
then
calling
aloud
towards
the
woods
though
it
is
near
night
it
is
an
event
in
the
wilderness
a
general
misfortune
now
and
again
she
gives
a
hail
to
isak
but
there
is
no
answer
he
must
be
out
of
hearing
where
are
the
sheep
what
can
have
come
to
them
is
there
a
bear
abroad
or
have
the
wolves
come
down
over
the
hills
from
sweden
and
finland
neither
as
it
turns
out
isak
finds
the
ewe
stuck
fast
in
a
cleft
of
rock
with
a
broken
leg
and
lacerated
udder
it
must
have
been
there
some
time
for
despite
its
wounds
the
poor
thing
has
nibbled
the
grass
down
to
the
roots
as
far
as
it
could
reach
isak
lifts
the
sheep
and
sets
it
free
it
falls
to
grazing
at
once
the
lamb
makes
for
its
mother
and
sucks
away
a
blessed
relief
for
the
wounded
udder
to
be
emptied
now
isak
gathers
stones
and
fills
up
the
dangerous
cleft
a
wicked
place
it
shall
break
no
more
sheep
thighs
isak
wears
leather
braces
he
takes
them
off
now
and
fastens
them
round
the
sheep
middle
as
a
support
for
the
udder
then
lifting
the
animal
on
his
shoulders
he
sets
off
home
the
lamb
at
his
heels
after
that
splints
and
tar
bandages
in
a
few
days
time
the
patient
begins
twitching
the
foot
of
the
wounded
leg
it
is
the
fracture
aching
as
it
grows
together
ay
all
things
getting
well
again
until
next
time
something
happens
the
daily
round
little
matters
that
are
all
important
to
the
themselves
oh
they
are
not
trifles
after
all
but
things
of
fate
making
for
their
happiness
and
comfort
and
or
against
them
in
the
slack
time
between
the
seasons
isak
smooths
down
some
new
he
has
thrown
to
be
used
for
something
or
other
no
doubt
also
he
digs
out
a
number
of
useful
stones
and
gets
them
down
to
the
house
as
soon
as
there
are
stones
enough
he
builds
a
wall
of
them
a
year
or
so
back
inger
would
have
been
curious
wondering
what
her
man
was
after
with
all
this
now
she
seemed
for
the
most
part
busied
with
her
own
work
and
asked
no
questions
inger
is
busy
as
ever
but
she
has
taken
to
singing
which
is
something
new
and
she
is
teaching
eleseus
an
evening
prayer
this
also
is
something
new
isak
misses
her
questioning
it
was
her
curiosity
and
her
praise
of
all
he
did
that
made
him
the
contented
man
the
incomparable
man
he
was
but
now
she
goes
by
saying
nothing
or
at
most
with
a
word
or
so
that
he
is
working
himself
to
death
she
troubled
after
that
last
time
for
all
she
says
thinks
isak
to
himself
oline
comes
over
to
visit
them
once
more
if
all
had
been
as
before
she
would
have
been
welcome
but
now
it
is
different
inger
greets
her
from
the
first
with
some
be
it
what
it
may
there
is
something
that
makes
inger
look
on
her
as
an
enemy
i
half
a
thought
i
be
coming
just
at
the
right
time
again
says
oline
with
delicate
meaning
how
mean
why
for
the
third
one
to
be
christened
how
is
it
with
you
now
nay
says
inger
for
that
matter
you
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
ho
oline
falls
to
praising
the
children
so
fine
and
big
they
grown
and
isak
taking
over
more
ground
and
going
to
build
again
by
the
look
of
things
there
no
end
to
things
with
them
a
wonderful
place
and
hard
to
find
its
like
and
what
is
he
going
to
build
this
time
ask
him
yourself
says
inger
i
do
know
nay
says
oline
is
no
business
of
mine
i
just
looked
along
to
see
how
things
were
with
you
here
it
a
pleasure
and
delight
for
me
to
see
as
for
goldenhorns
i
not
ask
nor
speak
of
her
fallen
into
proper
ways
as
any
one
can
see
they
talk
for
a
while
companionably
inger
is
no
longer
harsh
the
clock
on
the
wall
strikes
with
its
sweet
little
note
oline
looks
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
never
in
all
her
humble
life
did
she
hear
such
a
thing
is
like
church
and
organ
music
says
oline
inger
feels
herself
rich
and
towards
her
poor
relation
and
says
come
into
the
next
room
and
see
my
loom
oline
stays
all
day
she
talks
to
isak
and
praises
all
his
doings
and
i
hear
you
bought
up
the
land
for
miles
on
every
side
could
you
have
got
it
for
nothing
then
there
none
as
i
can
see
would
take
it
from
you
isak
had
been
feeling
the
need
of
praise
and
is
the
better
for
it
now
feels
a
man
again
i
buying
from
the
government
says
isak
ay
government
but
they
no
call
to
be
grasping
in
a
deal
surely
what
are
you
building
now
why
i
do
know
nothing
much
anyway
ay
you
getting
on
building
and
getting
on
you
are
painted
doors
to
the
house
and
a
clock
on
the
wall
is
a
new
grand
house
building
i
suspect
you
with
your
foolish
talk
says
isak
but
he
is
pleased
all
the
same
and
says
to
inger
could
you
make
a
bit
of
a
dish
of
nice
cream
custard
for
one
that
comes
that
i
ca
says
inger
for
i
churned
all
there
was
is
no
foolish
talk
puts
in
oline
hurriedly
i
but
a
simple
woman
asking
to
know
and
if
it
not
a
new
grand
house
why
be
a
new
big
barn
i
dare
say
and
why
not
with
all
these
fields
and
meadow
lands
fine
and
full
of
growth
ay
and
full
of
milk
and
honey
as
the
bible
says
isak
asks
how
things
looking
your
way
crops
and
the
like
why
is
there
as
it
is
till
now
if
only
the
lord
do
set
fire
to
it
all
again
this
year
and
burn
up
the
lot
heaven
forgive
me
i
should
say
the
word
is
all
in
his
hand
and
almighty
power
but
we
nothing
our
parts
that
any
way
like
this
place
of
yours
to
compare
and
that
the
solemn
truth
inger
asks
after
other
relatives
her
uncle
sivert
in
particular
he
is
the
great
man
of
the
family
and
owns
rich
fisheries
is
almost
a
wonder
how
he
can
find
a
way
to
spend
all
he
has
the
women
talk
of
uncle
sivert
and
isak
and
his
doings
somehow
drop
out
of
sight
no
one
asks
any
more
about
his
building
now
so
at
last
he
says
well
if
you
want
to
know
is
a
bit
of
a
barn
with
a
i
trying
to
get
set
up
just
as
i
thought
says
oline
folk
with
real
sound
sense
in
their
heads
they
do
that
way
and
and
all
as
it
should
be
there
not
a
pot
nor
pitcher
in
the
place
you
thought
of
a
you
said
isak
is
a
child
oline
flattering
words
go
to
his
head
and
he
answers
something
foolishly
with
fine
words
as
to
that
new
house
of
mine
there
must
be
a
in
the
same
necessarily
is
my
intention
so
a
says
oline
wagging
her
head
and
where
the
sense
of
growing
corn
on
the
place
if
we
nowhere
to
thresh
it
ay
is
as
i
say
not
a
thing
as
could
be
but
you
have
it
all
there
in
your
head
inger
is
suddenly
out
of
humour
again
the
talk
between
the
other
two
somehow
displeases
her
and
she
breaks
in
cream
custard
indeed
and
where
the
cream
to
come
from
fish
it
up
in
the
river
maybe
oline
hastens
to
make
peace
inger
lord
bless
you
child
speak
of
such
a
thing
not
a
word
of
cream
nor
custard
either
an
old
creature
like
me
that
does
but
idle
about
from
house
to
neighbour
isak
sits
for
a
while
then
up
and
saying
suddenly
here
am
i
doing
nothing
middle
of
the
day
and
stones
to
fetch
and
carry
for
that
wall
of
mine
ay
a
wall
like
that
need
a
mighty
lot
of
stone
to
be
sure
stone
says
isak
tis
like
as
if
there
never
be
enough
when
isak
is
gone
the
two
womenfolk
get
on
nicely
together
for
a
while
they
sit
for
hours
talking
of
this
and
that
in
the
evening
oline
must
go
out
and
see
how
their
live
stock
has
grown
cows
a
bull
two
calves
and
a
swarm
of
sheep
and
goats
i
do
know
where
it
ever
end
says
oline
with
her
eyes
turned
heavenwards
and
oline
stays
the
night
next
morning
she
goes
off
again
once
more
she
has
a
bundle
of
something
with
her
isak
is
working
in
the
quarry
and
she
goes
another
way
round
so
that
he
shall
not
see
two
hours
later
oline
comes
back
again
steps
into
the
house
and
asks
at
once
where
is
isak
inger
is
washing
up
oline
should
have
passed
by
the
quarry
where
isak
was
at
work
and
the
children
with
him
inger
at
once
guesses
something
wrong
isak
what
want
with
him
want
with
him
why
nothing
only
i
did
see
him
to
say
silence
oline
sits
down
on
a
bench
without
being
asked
drops
down
as
if
her
legs
refuse
to
carry
her
her
manner
is
intended
to
show
that
something
serious
is
the
matter
she
is
overcome
inger
can
control
herself
no
longer
her
face
is
all
terror
and
fury
as
she
says
i
saw
what
you
sent
me
by
ay
was
a
nice
thing
to
send
why
what
that
hare
what
do
you
mean
asks
oline
in
a
strangely
gentle
voice
ah
do
deny
it
cries
inger
her
eyes
wild
i
break
your
face
in
with
this
ladle
here
see
that
struck
her
ay
she
did
so
oline
took
the
first
blow
without
falling
and
only
cried
out
mind
what
you
doing
woman
i
know
what
i
know
about
you
and
your
doings
inger
strikes
again
gets
oline
down
to
the
floor
falls
on
her
there
and
thrusts
her
knees
into
her
mean
to
murder
me
asks
oline
the
terrible
woman
with
the
was
kneeling
on
her
a
great
strong
creature
armed
with
a
huge
wooden
ladle
heavy
as
a
club
oline
was
bruised
already
and
bleeding
but
still
sullenly
refusing
to
cry
out
so
you
trying
to
murder
me
ay
kill
you
says
inger
striking
again
there
i
see
you
dead
before
i
done
with
you
she
was
certain
of
it
now
oline
knew
her
secret
nothing
mattered
now
i
spoil
your
beastly
face
beastly
face
gasps
oline
huh
look
to
your
own
with
the
lord
his
mark
on
it
oline
is
hard
and
will
not
give
in
inger
is
forced
to
give
over
the
blows
that
are
exhausting
her
own
strength
but
she
threatens
still
glares
into
the
other
eyes
and
swears
she
has
not
finished
with
her
yet
there
more
to
come
ay
more
more
wait
till
i
get
a
knife
i
show
you
she
gets
on
her
feet
again
and
moves
as
if
to
look
for
a
knife
a
table
knife
but
now
her
fury
is
past
its
worst
and
she
falls
back
on
curses
and
abuse
oline
heaves
herself
up
to
the
bench
again
her
face
all
blue
and
yellow
swollen
and
bleeding
she
wipes
the
hair
from
her
forehead
straightens
her
kerchief
and
spits
her
mouth
too
is
bruised
and
swollen
you
devil
she
says
you
been
nosing
about
in
the
woods
cries
inger
that
what
you
been
doing
you
found
that
little
bit
of
a
grave
there
better
if
you
dug
one
for
yourself
the
same
time
ay
you
wait
says
oline
her
eyes
glowing
revengefully
i
say
no
more
but
you
wait
there
be
no
fine
house
for
you
with
musical
clocks
and
all
you
ca
take
it
from
me
anyway
ay
you
wait
you
see
what
oline
can
do
and
so
they
keep
on
oline
does
not
curse
and
hardly
raises
her
voice
there
is
something
almost
gentle
in
her
cold
cruelty
but
she
is
bitterly
dangerous
where
that
bundle
i
left
it
in
the
woods
but
you
shall
have
it
back
i
not
own
your
wool
ho
you
think
i
stolen
it
maybe
ah
you
know
best
what
you
done
so
back
and
forth
again
about
the
wool
inger
offers
to
show
the
very
sheep
it
was
cut
from
oline
asks
quietly
smoothly
ay
but
who
knows
where
you
got
the
first
sheep
to
start
with
inger
names
the
place
and
people
where
her
first
sheep
were
out
to
keep
with
their
lambs
and
you
mind
and
care
and
look
to
what
saying
says
she
threateningly
guard
your
mouth
or
you
be
sorry
ha
ha
ha
laughs
oline
softly
oline
is
never
at
a
loss
never
to
be
silenced
my
mouth
eh
and
what
of
your
own
my
dear
she
points
to
inger
calling
her
a
ghastly
sight
for
god
and
man
inger
answers
furiously
and
oline
being
fat
she
calls
her
a
lump
of
blubber
a
lump
of
dog
blubber
like
you
you
sent
me
a
hare
pay
you
for
that
hare
again
says
oline
if
i
no
more
guilt
in
anything
than
i
have
about
that
hare
what
was
it
like
what
was
it
like
why
what
a
hare
always
like
like
you
the
very
image
out
with
you
get
out
shrieks
inger
was
you
sent
with
that
hare
i
have
you
punished
have
you
put
in
prison
for
that
prison
was
it
prison
you
said
oh
you
jealous
and
envious
of
all
you
see
you
hate
me
for
all
the
good
things
i
got
says
inger
again
you
lain
awake
with
envy
since
i
got
isak
and
all
that
here
heavens
woman
what
have
i
ever
done
to
you
is
it
my
fault
that
your
children
never
got
on
in
the
world
and
turned
out
badly
every
one
of
them
you
ca
bear
the
sight
of
mine
because
they
fine
and
strong
and
better
named
than
yours
is
it
my
fault
they
prettier
flesh
and
blood
than
yours
ever
were
if
there
was
one
thing
could
drive
oline
to
fury
it
was
this
she
had
been
a
mother
many
times
and
all
she
had
was
her
children
such
as
they
were
she
made
much
of
them
and
boasted
of
them
told
of
great
things
they
had
never
really
done
and
hid
their
faults
what
that
you
saying
answered
oline
oh
that
you
do
sink
in
your
grave
for
shame
my
children
they
were
a
bright
host
of
angels
compared
with
yours
you
dare
to
speak
of
my
children
seven
blessed
gifts
of
god
they
were
from
they
were
little
and
all
grown
up
now
every
one
you
dare
to
speak
what
about
lise
that
was
sent
to
prison
asks
inger
for
never
a
thing
she
was
as
innocent
as
a
flower
answers
oline
and
she
in
bergen
now
lives
in
a
town
and
wears
a
hat
but
what
about
you
what
about
nils
what
did
they
say
of
him
oh
i
not
lower
myself
but
there
one
of
yours
now
lying
buried
out
there
in
the
woods
what
did
you
do
to
it
eh
now
out
you
go
shrieks
inger
again
and
makes
a
rush
at
oline
but
oline
does
not
move
does
not
even
rise
to
her
feet
her
stolid
indifference
paralyses
inger
who
draws
back
muttering
wait
till
i
get
that
knife
do
trouble
says
oline
i
going
but
as
for
you
turning
your
own
kin
out
of
doors
nay
i
say
no
more
get
out
of
this
that
all
you
need
to
do
but
oline
is
not
gone
yet
the
two
of
them
fall
to
again
with
words
and
abuse
a
long
bout
of
it
again
and
when
the
clock
strikes
half
of
the
hour
oline
laughs
scornfully
making
inger
wilder
than
ever
at
last
both
calm
down
a
little
and
oline
makes
ready
to
go
i
a
long
road
before
me
says
she
and
it
late
enough
to
be
starting
it
would
ha
been
amiss
to
have
had
a
bite
with
me
on
the
way
inger
makes
no
answer
she
has
come
to
her
senses
again
now
and
pours
out
water
in
a
basin
for
oline
to
there
if
you
want
to
tidy
yourself
she
says
oline
too
thinks
it
as
well
to
make
herself
as
decent
as
may
be
but
can
not
see
where
the
blood
is
and
washes
the
wrong
places
inger
looks
on
for
a
while
and
then
points
with
her
finger
there
wash
there
too
over
your
eye
no
not
that
the
other
one
ca
you
see
where
i
pointing
how
can
i
see
which
one
you
pointing
at
answers
oline
and
there
more
there
by
your
mouth
are
you
afraid
of
water
it
wo
bite
you
in
the
end
inger
washes
the
patient
herself
and
throws
her
a
towel
what
i
was
going
to
say
says
oline
wiping
herself
and
quite
peaceable
now
about
isak
and
the
children
how
will
they
get
over
this
does
he
know
asks
inger
know
he
came
and
saw
it
what
did
he
say
what
could
he
say
he
was
speechless
same
as
me
silence
it
all
your
fault
wails
inger
beginning
to
cry
my
fault
i
wish
i
may
never
have
more
to
answer
for
i
ask
anyhow
be
sure
of
that
ay
do
they
talk
it
all
over
quietly
and
oline
seems
less
revengeful
now
an
able
politician
is
oline
and
quick
to
find
expedients
she
speaks
now
as
if
in
sympathy
what
a
terrible
thing
it
will
be
for
isak
and
the
children
when
it
is
found
out
yes
says
inger
crying
again
i
thought
and
thought
of
that
night
and
day
oline
thinks
she
might
be
able
to
help
and
be
a
saviour
to
them
in
distress
she
could
come
and
stay
on
the
place
to
look
after
things
while
inger
is
in
prison
inger
stops
crying
stops
suddenly
as
if
to
listen
and
take
thought
no
you
do
care
for
the
children
do
care
for
them
do
i
how
could
you
say
such
a
thing
ah
i
know
why
if
there
one
thing
in
the
world
i
do
feel
and
care
for
is
children
ay
for
your
own
says
inger
but
how
would
you
be
with
mine
and
when
i
think
how
you
sent
that
hare
for
nothing
else
but
to
ruin
me
altogether
oh
you
no
better
than
a
heap
of
wickedness
am
i
says
oline
is
it
me
you
mean
yes
is
you
i
mean
says
inger
crying
you
been
a
wicked
wretch
you
have
and
i
not
trust
you
and
you
steal
all
the
wool
too
if
you
did
come
and
all
the
cheeses
that
go
to
your
people
instead
of
mine
oh
you
wicked
creature
to
think
of
such
a
thing
answers
oline
inger
cries
and
wipes
her
eyes
saying
a
word
or
so
between
oline
does
not
try
to
force
her
if
inger
does
not
care
about
the
idea
is
all
the
same
to
her
she
can
go
and
stay
with
her
son
nils
as
she
has
always
done
but
now
that
inger
is
to
be
sent
away
to
prison
it
will
be
a
hard
time
for
isak
and
the
innocent
children
oline
could
stay
on
the
place
and
give
an
eye
to
things
you
can
think
it
over
says
oline
inger
has
lost
the
day
she
cries
and
shakes
her
head
and
looks
down
she
goes
out
as
if
walking
in
her
sleep
and
makes
up
a
parcel
of
food
for
oline
to
take
with
her
is
more
than
worth
your
while
says
oline
you
ca
go
all
that
way
without
a
bite
to
eat
says
inger
when
oline
has
gone
inger
steals
out
looks
round
and
listens
no
no
sound
from
the
quarry
she
goes
nearer
and
hears
the
children
playing
with
little
stones
isak
is
sitting
down
holding
the
crowbar
between
his
knees
and
resting
on
it
like
a
staff
there
he
sits
inger
steals
away
into
the
edge
of
the
wood
there
was
a
spot
where
she
had
set
a
little
cross
in
the
ground
the
cross
is
thrown
down
now
and
where
it
stood
the
turf
has
been
lifted
and
the
ground
turned
over
she
stoops
down
and
pats
the
earth
together
again
with
her
hands
and
there
she
sits
she
had
come
out
of
curiosity
to
see
how
far
the
little
grave
had
been
disturbed
by
oline
she
stays
there
now
because
the
cattle
have
not
yet
come
in
for
the
night
sits
there
crying
shaking
her
head
and
looking
down
chapter
vii
and
the
days
pass
a
blessed
time
for
the
soil
with
sun
and
showers
of
rain
the
crops
are
looking
well
the
haymaking
is
nearly
over
now
and
they
have
got
in
a
grand
lot
of
hay
almost
more
than
they
can
find
room
for
some
is
stowed
away
under
overhanging
rocks
in
the
stable
under
the
flooring
of
the
house
itself
the
shed
at
the
side
is
emptied
of
everything
to
make
room
for
more
hay
inger
herself
works
early
and
late
a
faithful
helper
and
support
isak
takes
advantage
of
every
fall
of
rain
to
put
in
a
spell
of
roofing
on
the
new
barn
and
get
the
south
wall
at
least
fully
done
once
that
is
ready
they
can
stuff
in
as
much
hay
as
they
please
the
work
is
going
forward
they
will
manage
never
fear
and
their
great
sorrow
and
disaster
ay
it
was
there
the
thing
was
done
and
what
it
brought
must
come
good
things
mostly
leave
no
trace
but
something
always
comes
of
evil
isak
took
the
matter
sensibly
from
the
first
he
made
no
great
words
about
it
but
asked
his
wife
simply
how
did
you
come
to
do
it
inger
made
no
answer
to
that
and
a
little
after
he
spoke
again
strangled
it
was
that
what
you
did
yes
said
inger
you
should
have
done
that
no
she
agreed
and
i
ca
make
out
how
you
ever
could
bring
yourself
to
do
it
she
was
all
the
same
as
myself
said
inger
how
mean
her
mouth
isak
thought
over
that
for
some
time
ay
well
said
he
and
nothing
more
was
said
about
it
at
the
time
the
days
went
on
peacefully
as
ever
there
was
all
the
mass
of
hay
to
be
got
in
and
a
rare
heavy
crop
all
round
so
that
by
degrees
the
thing
slipped
into
the
background
of
their
minds
but
it
hung
over
them
and
over
the
place
none
the
less
they
could
not
hope
that
oline
would
keep
the
secret
it
was
too
much
to
expect
and
even
if
oline
said
nothing
others
would
speak
dumb
witnesses
would
find
a
tongue
the
walls
of
the
house
the
trees
around
the
little
grave
in
the
wood
the
lapp
would
throw
out
hints
inger
herself
would
betray
it
sleeping
or
waking
they
were
prepared
for
the
worst
isak
took
the
matter
sensibly
what
else
was
there
to
do
he
knew
now
why
inger
had
always
taken
care
to
be
left
alone
at
every
birth
to
be
alone
with
her
fears
of
how
the
child
might
be
and
face
the
danger
with
no
one
by
three
times
she
had
done
the
same
thing
isak
shook
his
head
touched
with
pity
for
her
ill
fate
poor
inger
he
learned
of
the
coming
of
the
lapp
with
the
hare
and
acquitted
her
it
led
to
a
great
love
between
them
a
wild
love
they
drew
closer
to
each
other
in
their
peril
inger
was
full
of
a
desperate
sweetness
towards
him
and
the
great
heavy
fellow
lumbering
carrier
of
burdens
felt
a
greed
and
an
endless
desire
for
her
in
himself
and
inger
for
all
that
she
wore
hide
shoes
like
a
lapp
was
no
withered
little
creature
as
the
lapland
women
are
but
splendidly
big
it
was
summer
now
and
she
went
about
barefooted
with
her
naked
legs
showing
almost
to
the
knee
isak
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
those
bare
legs
all
through
the
summer
she
went
about
singing
bits
of
hymns
and
she
taught
eleseus
to
say
prayers
but
there
grew
up
in
her
an
unchristian
hate
of
all
lapps
and
she
spoke
plainly
enough
to
any
that
passed
some
one
might
have
sent
them
again
like
as
not
they
had
a
hare
in
their
bag
as
before
let
them
go
on
their
way
and
no
more
about
it
a
hare
what
hare
ho
you
have
heard
perhaps
what
he
did
that
time
no
well
i
do
care
who
knows
it
he
came
up
here
with
a
hare
when
i
was
with
child
dear
and
that
was
a
dreadful
thing
and
what
happened
never
you
mind
what
happened
just
get
along
with
you
that
all
here
a
bite
of
food
and
get
along
you
do
happen
to
have
an
odd
bit
of
leather
anywhere
i
could
mend
my
shoe
with
no
i
but
i
give
you
a
bit
of
stick
if
you
do
get
out
now
a
lapp
will
beg
as
humbly
as
could
be
but
say
no
to
him
and
he
turns
bad
and
threatens
a
pair
of
lapps
with
two
children
came
past
the
place
the
children
were
sent
up
to
the
house
to
beg
and
came
back
and
said
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
about
the
place
the
four
of
them
stood
there
a
while
talking
in
their
own
tongue
then
the
man
went
up
to
see
he
went
inside
and
stayed
then
his
wife
went
up
and
the
children
after
all
of
them
stood
inside
the
doorway
talking
lapp
the
man
puts
his
head
in
the
doorway
and
peeps
through
into
the
room
no
one
there
either
the
clock
strikes
the
hour
and
the
whole
family
stand
listening
in
wonder
inger
must
have
had
some
idea
there
were
strangers
about
she
comes
hurrying
down
the
hillside
and
seeing
lapps
strange
lapps
into
the
bargain
asks
them
straight
out
what
they
are
doing
there
what
do
you
want
in
here
could
you
see
there
was
no
one
at
home
h
says
the
man
get
out
with
you
says
inger
again
and
go
on
your
way
the
lapps
move
out
slowly
unwillingly
we
were
just
listening
to
that
clock
of
yours
says
the
man
is
a
wonder
to
hear
that
it
is
you
have
a
bit
of
bread
to
spare
says
his
wife
where
do
you
come
from
asks
inger
from
the
water
over
beyond
we
been
walking
all
night
and
where
are
you
going
to
now
across
the
hills
inger
makes
up
some
food
for
them
when
she
comes
out
with
it
the
woman
starts
begging
again
a
bit
of
stuff
for
a
cap
a
tuft
of
wool
a
stump
of
cheese
anything
inger
has
no
time
to
waste
isak
and
the
children
are
in
the
hayfield
be
off
with
you
now
she
says
the
woman
tries
flattery
we
saw
your
place
up
here
and
the
cattle
a
host
of
them
like
the
stars
in
the
sky
ay
a
wonder
says
the
man
you
have
a
pair
of
old
shoes
to
give
away
to
needy
folk
inger
shuts
the
door
of
the
house
and
goes
back
to
her
work
on
the
hillside
the
man
called
after
her
she
pretended
not
to
hear
and
walked
on
unheeding
but
she
heard
it
well
enough
you
do
want
to
buy
any
hares
maybe
there
was
no
mistaking
what
he
had
said
the
lapp
himself
might
have
spoken
innocently
enough
some
one
had
told
him
perhaps
or
he
might
have
meant
it
be
that
as
it
may
inger
took
it
as
a
warning
a
message
of
what
was
to
come
the
days
went
on
the
settlers
were
healthy
folk
what
was
to
come
would
come
they
went
about
their
work
and
waited
they
lived
close
to
each
other
like
beasts
of
the
forest
they
slept
and
ate
already
the
year
was
so
far
advanced
that
they
had
tried
the
new
potatoes
and
found
them
large
and
floury
the
blow
that
was
to
fall
why
did
it
not
come
it
was
late
in
august
already
soon
it
would
be
september
were
they
to
be
spared
through
the
winter
they
lived
in
a
constant
watchfulness
every
night
they
crept
close
together
in
their
cave
thankful
that
the
day
had
passed
without
event
and
so
the
time
went
on
until
one
day
in
october
when
the
lensmand
came
up
with
a
man
and
a
bag
the
law
stepped
in
through
their
doorway
the
investigation
took
some
time
inger
was
called
up
and
examined
privately
she
denied
nothing
the
grave
in
the
wood
was
opened
and
its
contents
removed
the
body
being
sent
for
examination
the
little
body
it
was
dressed
in
eleseus
christening
robe
and
a
cap
sewn
over
with
beads
isak
seemed
to
find
speech
again
ay
said
he
it
as
bad
as
well
can
be
with
us
now
i
said
before
you
ought
never
to
have
done
it
no
said
inger
how
did
you
do
it
inger
made
no
answer
that
you
could
find
it
in
your
heart
she
was
just
the
same
as
myself
to
look
at
and
so
i
took
and
twisted
her
face
round
isak
shook
his
head
slowly
and
then
she
was
dead
went
on
inger
beginning
to
cry
isak
was
silent
for
a
while
well
well
is
too
late
to
be
crying
over
it
now
said
he
she
had
brown
hair
sobbed
inger
there
at
the
back
of
her
head
and
again
no
more
was
said
time
went
on
as
before
inger
was
not
locked
up
the
law
was
merciful
lensmand
heyerdahl
asked
her
questions
just
as
he
might
have
spoken
to
any
one
and
only
said
it
a
great
pity
such
things
should
happen
at
all
inger
asked
who
had
informed
against
her
but
the
lensmand
answered
that
it
was
no
one
in
particular
many
had
spoken
of
the
matter
and
he
had
heard
of
it
from
several
quarters
had
she
not
herself
said
something
about
it
to
some
lapps
inger
ay
she
had
told
some
lapps
about
how
he
came
and
brought
a
hare
that
summer
and
gave
her
unborn
child
the
and
was
it
oline
who
had
sent
the
hare
the
lensmand
knew
nothing
about
that
but
in
any
case
he
could
not
think
of
putting
down
such
ignorant
superstition
in
his
report
but
my
mother
saw
a
hare
just
before
i
was
born
said
inger
the
barn
was
finished
a
great
big
place
it
was
with
on
both
sides
and
a
in
the
middle
the
shed
and
the
other
makeshift
places
were
emptied
now
and
all
the
hay
brought
into
the
barn
the
corn
was
reaped
dried
in
stacks
and
carted
in
inger
took
up
the
carrots
and
turnips
all
their
crops
were
in
now
and
everything
might
have
been
well
with
them
they
had
all
they
needed
isak
had
started
on
new
ground
again
before
the
frost
came
to
make
a
bigger
cornfield
isak
was
a
tiller
of
the
soil
but
in
november
inger
said
one
day
she
would
have
been
six
months
old
now
and
known
us
all
is
no
good
talking
of
that
now
said
isak
when
the
winter
came
isak
threshed
his
corn
on
the
new
and
inger
helped
him
often
with
an
arm
as
quick
to
the
work
as
his
own
while
the
children
played
in
the
haystalls
at
the
side
it
was
fine
plump
grain
early
in
the
new
year
the
roads
were
good
and
isak
started
carting
down
his
loads
of
wood
to
the
village
he
had
his
regular
customers
now
and
the
wood
fetched
a
good
price
one
day
he
and
inger
agreed
that
they
should
take
the
fine
from
goldenhorns
and
drive
it
down
to
fru
geissler
with
a
cheese
into
the
bargain
she
was
delighted
and
asked
how
much
it
cost
nothing
said
isak
the
lensmand
paid
for
it
before
heaven
bless
him
and
did
he
said
fru
geissler
touched
at
the
thought
she
sent
things
up
for
eleseus
and
sivert
in
return
cakes
and
and
toys
when
isak
came
back
and
inger
saw
the
things
she
turned
away
and
cried
what
is
it
asked
isak
nothing
answered
inger
only
she
have
been
just
a
year
now
and
able
to
see
it
all
ay
but
you
know
how
it
was
with
her
said
isak
for
comfort
sake
and
after
all
it
may
be
we
get
off
easier
than
we
thought
found
out
where
geissler
is
now
inger
looked
up
but
how
that
going
to
help
us
i
do
know
then
isak
carried
his
corn
to
the
mill
and
had
it
ground
and
brought
back
flour
then
he
turned
woodman
again
cutting
the
wood
to
be
ready
for
next
winter
his
life
was
spent
in
this
work
and
that
according
to
the
season
from
the
fields
to
the
woods
and
back
to
the
fields
again
he
had
worked
on
the
place
for
six
years
now
and
inger
five
all
might
have
been
well
if
it
were
only
allowed
to
last
but
it
was
not
inger
worked
at
her
loom
and
tended
the
animals
also
she
was
often
to
be
heard
singing
hymns
but
it
was
a
pitiful
singing
she
was
like
a
bell
without
a
tongue
as
soon
as
the
roads
were
passable
she
was
sent
for
down
to
the
village
to
be
examined
isak
had
to
stay
behind
and
being
there
all
alone
it
came
into
his
mind
to
go
across
to
sweden
and
find
out
geissler
the
former
lensmand
had
been
kind
to
them
and
might
perhaps
still
lend
a
helping
hand
some
way
to
the
folks
at
sellanraa
but
when
inger
returned
she
had
asked
about
things
herself
and
learned
something
of
what
her
sentence
was
likely
to
be
strictly
speaking
it
was
imprisonment
for
life
paragraph
i
but
after
all
she
had
stood
up
in
the
court
itself
and
simply
confessed
the
two
witnesses
from
the
village
had
looked
pityingly
at
her
and
the
judge
had
put
his
questions
kindly
but
for
all
that
she
was
no
match
for
the
bright
intellects
of
the
law
lawyers
are
great
men
to
simple
folk
they
can
quote
paragraph
this
and
section
that
they
have
learned
such
things
by
rote
ready
to
bring
out
at
any
moment
oh
they
are
great
men
indeed
and
apart
from
all
this
knowledge
they
are
not
always
devoid
of
sense
sometimes
even
not
altogether
heartless
inger
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
the
court
she
made
no
mention
of
the
hare
but
when
she
tearfully
explained
that
she
could
not
be
so
cruel
to
her
poor
deformed
child
as
to
let
it
live
the
magistrate
nodded
quietly
and
seriously
but
said
he
think
of
yourself
you
have
a
and
it
has
not
spoilt
your
life
no
thanks
be
to
god
was
all
she
said
she
could
not
tell
them
of
all
she
had
suffered
in
secret
as
a
child
as
a
young
girl
but
the
magistrate
must
have
understood
something
of
what
it
meant
he
himself
had
a
and
could
not
dance
as
to
the
sentence
he
said
i
hardly
know
really
it
should
be
imprisonment
for
life
but
i
ca
say
perhaps
we
might
get
it
commuted
second
or
third
degree
fifteen
to
twelve
years
or
twelve
to
nine
there
a
commission
sitting
to
reform
the
criminal
code
make
it
more
humane
but
the
final
decision
wo
be
ready
yet
anyhow
we
must
hope
for
the
best
said
he
inger
came
back
in
a
state
of
dull
resignation
they
had
not
found
it
necessary
to
keep
her
in
confinement
meantime
two
months
passed
then
one
evening
when
isak
came
back
from
fishing
the
lensmand
and
his
new
assistant
had
been
to
sellanraa
inger
was
cheerful
and
welcomed
her
husband
kindly
praising
his
catch
though
it
was
little
he
had
brought
home
what
i
was
going
to
say
has
any
one
been
here
he
asked
any
one
been
why
who
should
there
be
there
fresh
footmarks
outside
men
with
boots
on
why
there
been
no
one
but
the
lensmand
and
one
other
what
did
they
want
you
know
that
without
asking
did
they
come
to
fetch
you
fetch
me
no
was
only
about
the
sentence
the
lord
is
kind
is
not
so
bad
as
i
feared
ah
said
isak
eagerly
not
so
long
maybe
no
only
a
few
years
how
many
years
why
you
might
think
it
a
lot
maybe
but
i
thankful
to
god
all
the
same
inger
did
not
say
how
long
it
would
be
later
that
evening
isak
asked
when
they
would
be
coming
to
fetch
her
away
but
this
she
could
not
or
would
not
tell
she
had
grown
thoughtful
again
and
talked
of
what
was
to
come
how
they
would
manage
she
could
not
think
but
she
supposed
they
would
have
to
get
oline
to
come
and
isak
had
no
better
plan
to
offer
what
had
become
of
oline
by
the
way
she
had
not
been
up
this
year
as
she
used
to
do
was
she
going
to
stay
away
for
ever
now
that
she
had
upset
everything
for
them
the
working
season
passed
but
oline
did
not
come
did
she
expect
them
to
go
and
fetch
her
she
would
come
loitering
up
of
herself
no
doubt
the
great
lump
of
blubber
the
monster
and
at
last
one
day
she
did
extraordinary
person
it
was
as
nothing
whatever
had
occurred
to
make
between
them
she
was
even
knitting
a
pair
of
new
stockings
for
eleseus
she
said
just
came
up
to
see
how
you
were
getting
on
over
here
said
she
and
it
turned
out
that
she
had
brought
her
clothes
and
things
up
in
a
sack
and
left
in
the
woods
close
by
ready
to
stay
that
evening
inger
took
her
husband
aside
and
said
did
you
say
something
about
seeking
out
geissler
is
in
the
slack
time
now
ay
said
isak
now
that
oline
is
come
i
can
go
off
tomorrow
morning
first
thing
inger
was
grateful
and
thanked
him
and
take
your
money
with
you
she
said
all
you
have
in
the
place
why
ca
you
keep
the
money
here
no
said
she
inger
made
up
a
big
parcel
of
food
at
once
and
isak
woke
while
it
was
yet
night
and
got
ready
to
start
inger
went
out
on
the
to
see
him
off
she
did
not
cry
or
complain
but
only
said
they
may
be
coming
for
me
now
any
day
you
do
know
when
no
i
ca
say
and
i
do
suppose
it
will
be
just
yet
but
anyhow
if
only
you
could
get
hold
of
geissler
perhaps
he
might
be
able
to
say
something
what
could
geissler
do
to
help
them
now
nothing
but
isak
went
inger
oh
she
knew
no
doubt
more
than
she
had
been
willing
to
say
it
might
be
too
that
she
herself
had
sent
for
oline
when
isak
came
from
sweden
inger
was
gone
and
oline
was
there
with
the
two
children
it
was
dark
news
for
a
homecoming
isak
voice
was
louder
than
usual
as
he
asked
is
she
gone
ay
said
oline
what
day
was
it
the
day
after
you
left
and
isak
knew
now
that
inger
had
got
him
out
of
the
way
on
purpose
that
was
why
she
had
persuaded
him
to
take
the
money
with
him
oh
but
she
might
have
kept
a
little
for
herself
for
that
long
journey
but
the
children
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
little
pig
isak
had
brought
with
him
it
was
all
he
had
for
his
trouble
the
address
he
had
was
out
of
date
and
geissler
was
no
longer
in
sweden
but
had
returned
to
norway
and
was
now
in
trondhjem
as
for
the
pig
isak
had
carried
it
in
his
arms
all
the
way
feeding
it
with
milk
from
a
bottle
and
sleeping
with
it
on
his
breast
among
the
hills
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
inger
delight
when
she
saw
it
now
eleseus
and
sivert
played
with
it
and
it
was
a
joy
to
them
and
isak
watching
them
forgot
his
trouble
for
the
moment
moreover
oline
had
a
message
from
the
lensmand
the
state
had
at
last
given
its
decision
in
the
matter
of
the
land
at
sellanraa
isak
had
only
to
go
down
to
the
office
and
pay
the
amount
this
was
good
news
and
served
to
keep
him
from
the
worst
depth
of
despair
tired
and
worn
out
as
he
was
he
packed
up
some
food
in
a
bag
and
set
off
for
the
village
at
once
maybe
he
had
some
little
hope
of
seeing
inger
once
again
before
she
left
there
but
he
was
disappointed
inger
was
gone
for
eight
years
isak
felt
himself
in
a
mist
of
darkness
and
emptiness
heard
only
a
word
here
and
there
of
all
the
lensmand
said
a
pity
such
things
should
happen
hoped
it
might
be
a
lesson
to
her
reform
and
be
a
better
woman
after
and
not
kill
her
children
any
more
lensmand
heyerdahl
had
married
the
year
before
his
wife
had
no
intention
of
ever
being
a
mother
no
children
for
her
thank
you
and
she
had
none
and
now
said
the
lensmand
this
business
about
sellanraa
at
last
i
am
in
a
position
to
settle
it
definitely
the
department
is
graciously
pleased
to
approve
the
sale
of
the
land
more
or
less
according
to
the
terms
i
suggested
h
said
isak
it
has
been
a
lengthy
business
but
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
endeavours
have
not
been
altogether
fruitless
the
terms
i
proposed
have
been
agreed
to
almost
without
exception
without
exception
said
isak
and
nodded
here
are
the
you
can
have
the
transfer
registered
at
the
first
session
ay
said
isak
and
how
much
is
there
to
pay
ten
a
year
the
department
has
made
a
slight
alteration
here
ten
per
annum
instead
of
five
you
have
no
objection
to
that
i
presume
as
long
as
i
can
manage
to
pay
said
isak
and
for
ten
years
isak
looked
up
half
frightened
those
are
the
terms
the
department
insists
even
then
it
no
price
really
for
all
that
land
cleared
and
cultivated
as
it
is
now
isak
had
the
ten
for
that
year
it
was
the
money
he
had
got
for
his
loads
of
wood
and
for
the
cheeses
inger
had
laid
by
he
paid
the
amount
and
had
still
a
small
sum
left
it
a
lucky
thing
for
you
the
department
did
get
to
hear
about
your
wife
said
the
lensmand
or
they
might
have
sold
to
some
one
else
ay
said
isak
he
asked
about
inger
is
it
true
that
she
gone
away
for
eight
years
that
is
so
and
ca
be
altered
the
law
must
take
its
course
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
sentence
is
extraordinarily
light
there
one
thing
you
must
do
now
that
is
to
set
up
clear
boundaries
between
your
land
and
the
state
a
straight
direct
line
following
the
marks
i
set
up
on
the
spot
and
entered
in
my
register
at
the
time
the
timber
cleared
from
the
boundary
line
becomes
your
property
i
will
come
up
some
time
and
have
a
look
at
what
you
have
done
isak
trudged
back
to
his
home
chapter
viii
time
flies
ay
when
a
man
is
growing
old
isak
was
not
old
he
had
not
lost
his
vigour
the
years
seemed
long
to
him
he
worked
on
his
land
and
let
his
iron
beard
grow
as
it
would
now
and
again
the
monotony
of
the
wilderness
was
broken
by
the
sight
of
a
passing
lapp
or
by
something
happening
to
one
of
the
animals
on
the
place
then
all
would
be
as
before
once
there
came
a
number
of
men
at
once
they
rested
at
sellanraa
and
had
some
food
and
a
dish
of
milk
they
asked
isak
and
oline
about
the
path
across
the
hills
they
were
marking
out
the
telegraph
line
they
said
and
once
came
geissler
geissler
himself
and
no
other
there
he
came
free
and
easy
as
ever
walking
up
from
the
village
two
men
with
him
carrying
mining
tools
pick
and
spade
oh
that
geissler
unchanged
the
same
as
ever
meeting
and
greeting
as
if
nothing
had
happened
talked
to
the
children
went
into
the
house
and
came
out
again
looked
over
the
ground
opened
the
doors
of
cowshed
and
hayloft
and
looked
in
excellent
said
he
isak
have
you
still
got
those
bits
of
stone
bits
of
stone
said
isak
wondering
little
heavy
lumps
of
stone
i
saw
the
boy
playing
with
when
i
was
here
once
before
the
stones
were
out
in
the
larder
serving
as
weights
for
so
many
isak
brought
them
in
geissler
and
the
two
men
examined
them
talking
together
tapped
them
here
and
there
weighed
them
in
the
hand
copper
they
said
could
you
go
up
with
us
and
show
where
you
found
them
asked
geissler
they
all
went
up
together
it
was
not
far
to
the
place
where
isak
had
found
the
stones
but
they
stayed
up
in
the
hills
for
a
couple
of
days
looking
for
veins
of
metal
and
firing
charges
here
and
there
they
came
down
to
sellanraa
with
two
bags
filled
with
heavy
lumps
of
stone
isak
had
meanwhile
had
a
talk
with
geissler
and
told
him
everything
as
to
his
own
position
about
the
purchase
of
the
land
which
had
come
to
a
hundred
instead
of
fifty
that
a
trifle
said
geissler
easily
you
thousands
like
as
not
on
your
part
of
the
hills
ho
said
isak
but
you
better
get
those
entered
in
the
register
as
soon
as
ever
you
can
ay
then
the
state
ca
come
any
nonsense
about
it
after
you
understand
isak
understood
is
worst
about
inger
he
said
ay
said
geissler
and
remained
thoughtful
longer
than
was
usual
with
him
might
get
the
case
brought
up
again
set
out
the
whole
thing
properly
very
likely
get
the
sentence
reduced
a
bit
or
we
could
put
in
an
application
for
a
pardon
and
that
would
probably
come
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
why
if
as
that
could
be
done
but
it
would
do
to
try
for
a
pardon
at
once
have
to
wait
a
bit
what
was
i
going
to
say
you
been
taking
things
down
to
my
wife
meat
and
cheese
and
things
what
why
as
to
that
lensmand
paid
for
all
that
before
did
i
though
and
helped
us
kindly
in
many
a
way
not
a
bit
of
it
said
geissler
shortly
here
take
this
and
he
took
out
some
notes
geissler
was
not
the
man
to
take
things
for
nothing
that
was
plain
and
he
seemed
to
have
plenty
of
money
about
him
from
the
way
his
pocket
bulged
heaven
only
knew
if
he
really
had
money
or
not
but
she
writes
all
well
and
getting
on
said
isak
coming
back
to
his
one
thought
what
oh
your
wife
ay
and
since
the
girl
was
born
she
had
a
girl
child
born
while
she
was
there
a
fine
little
one
excellent
ay
and
now
they
all
as
kind
as
can
be
and
help
her
every
way
she
says
look
here
said
geissler
i
going
to
send
these
bits
of
stone
in
to
some
mining
experts
and
find
out
what
in
them
if
there
a
decent
percentage
of
copper
you
be
a
rich
man
h
said
isak
and
how
long
do
you
think
before
we
could
apply
for
a
pardon
well
not
so
very
long
perhaps
i
write
the
thing
for
you
be
back
here
again
soon
what
was
it
you
said
your
wife
has
had
a
child
since
she
left
here
yes
then
they
took
her
away
while
she
was
expecting
it
that
a
thing
they
no
right
to
do
ho
anyhow
it
one
more
reason
for
letting
her
out
earlier
ay
if
that
could
be
said
isak
gratefully
isak
knew
nothing
of
the
many
lengthy
writings
backward
and
forward
between
the
different
authorities
concerning
the
woman
who
was
expecting
a
child
the
local
authorities
had
let
her
go
free
while
the
matter
was
pending
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
they
had
no
in
the
village
where
they
could
keep
her
and
in
the
second
place
they
wished
to
be
as
lenient
as
possible
the
consequence
was
something
they
could
not
have
foreseen
later
when
they
had
sent
to
fetch
her
away
no
one
had
inquired
about
her
condition
and
she
herself
had
said
nothing
of
it
possibly
she
had
concealed
the
matter
on
purpose
in
order
to
have
a
child
with
her
during
the
years
of
imprisonment
if
she
behaved
well
she
would
no
doubt
be
allowed
to
see
it
now
and
again
or
perhaps
she
had
been
merely
indifferent
and
had
gone
off
carelessly
despite
her
state
isak
worked
and
toiled
dug
ditches
and
broke
new
ground
set
up
his
boundary
lines
between
his
land
and
the
state
and
gained
another
season
stock
of
timber
but
now
that
inger
was
no
longer
there
to
wonder
at
his
doings
he
worked
more
from
habit
than
for
any
joy
in
what
he
did
and
he
had
let
two
sessions
pass
without
having
his
registered
caring
little
about
it
at
last
that
autumn
he
had
pulled
himself
together
and
got
it
done
things
were
not
as
they
should
be
with
isak
now
quiet
and
patient
as
ever
yes
but
now
it
was
because
he
did
not
care
he
got
out
hides
because
it
had
to
be
done
goatskins
and
calfskins
steeped
them
in
the
river
laid
them
in
bark
and
tanned
them
after
a
fashion
ready
for
shoes
in
the
winter
at
the
very
first
threshing
he
set
aside
his
seed
corn
for
the
next
spring
in
order
to
have
it
done
best
to
have
things
done
and
done
with
he
was
a
methodical
man
but
it
was
a
grey
and
lonely
life
eyah
a
man
without
a
wife
again
and
all
the
rest
what
pleasure
was
there
now
in
sitting
at
home
sundays
cleanly
washed
with
a
neat
red
shirt
on
when
there
was
no
one
to
be
clean
and
neat
for
sundays
were
the
longest
days
of
all
days
when
he
was
forced
to
idleness
and
weary
thoughts
nothing
to
do
but
wander
about
over
the
place
counting
up
all
that
should
have
been
done
he
always
took
the
children
with
him
always
carried
one
on
his
arm
it
was
a
distraction
to
hear
their
chatter
and
answer
their
questions
of
everything
he
kept
old
oline
because
there
was
no
one
else
he
could
get
and
oline
was
after
all
of
use
in
a
way
carding
and
spinning
knitting
stockings
and
mittens
and
making
cheese
she
could
do
all
these
things
but
she
lacked
inger
happy
touch
and
had
no
heart
in
her
work
nothing
of
all
she
handled
was
her
own
there
was
a
thing
isak
had
bought
once
at
the
village
store
a
china
pot
with
a
dog
head
on
the
lid
it
was
a
sort
of
tobacco
box
really
and
stood
on
a
shelf
oline
took
off
the
lid
and
dropped
it
on
the
floor
inger
had
left
behind
some
cuttings
of
fuchsia
under
glass
oline
took
the
glass
off
and
putting
it
back
pressed
it
down
hard
and
maliciously
next
day
all
the
cuttings
were
dead
it
was
not
so
easy
for
isak
to
bear
with
such
things
he
looked
displeased
and
showed
it
and
as
there
was
nothing
swanlike
and
gentle
about
isak
it
may
well
be
that
he
showed
it
plainly
oline
cared
little
for
looks
as
ever
she
only
said
now
could
i
help
it
that
i
ca
say
answered
isak
but
you
might
have
left
the
things
alone
i
not
touch
her
flowers
again
said
oline
but
the
flowers
were
already
dead
again
how
could
it
be
that
the
lapps
came
up
to
sellanraa
so
frequently
of
late
for
instance
had
no
business
there
at
all
he
should
have
passed
on
his
way
twice
in
one
summer
he
came
across
the
hills
and
it
should
be
remembered
had
no
reindeer
to
look
to
but
lived
by
begging
and
quartering
himself
on
other
lapps
as
soon
as
he
came
up
to
the
place
oline
left
her
work
and
fell
to
chatting
with
him
about
people
in
the
village
and
when
he
left
his
sack
was
heavy
with
no
end
of
things
isak
put
up
with
it
for
two
years
saying
nothing
then
oline
wanted
new
shoes
again
and
he
could
be
silent
no
longer
it
was
in
the
autumn
and
oline
wore
shoes
every
day
instead
of
going
in
wooden
pattens
or
rough
hide
looks
like
being
fine
today
said
isak
h
that
was
how
he
began
ay
said
oline
those
cheeses
eleseus
went
on
isak
again
was
it
ten
you
counted
on
the
shelf
this
morning
ay
said
eleseus
well
there
but
nine
there
now
eleseus
counted
again
and
thought
for
a
moment
inside
his
little
head
then
he
said
yes
but
then
had
one
to
take
away
that
makes
ten
there
was
silence
for
quite
a
while
after
that
then
little
sivert
must
try
to
count
as
well
and
says
after
his
brother
that
makes
ten
silence
again
at
last
oline
felt
she
must
say
something
ay
i
did
give
him
a
tiny
one
that
true
i
did
think
that
could
do
any
harm
but
they
children
they
no
sooner
able
to
talk
than
they
show
what
in
them
and
who
they
take
after
more
than
i
can
think
or
guess
for
is
not
your
way
isak
that
i
do
know
the
hint
was
too
plain
to
pass
unchecked
the
children
are
well
enough
said
isak
shortly
but
i
like
to
know
what
good
has
ever
done
to
me
and
mine
what
good
ay
that
what
i
said
what
good
ay
since
i
to
give
him
cheeses
in
return
oline
has
had
time
to
think
and
has
her
answer
ready
now
well
now
i
would
have
thought
it
of
you
isak
that
i
would
was
it
me
pray
that
first
began
with
i
wish
i
may
never
move
alive
from
this
spot
if
i
ever
so
much
as
spoke
his
name
brilliant
success
for
oline
isak
has
to
give
in
as
he
has
done
many
a
time
before
but
oline
had
more
to
say
and
if
you
mean
i
to
go
here
clean
barefoot
with
the
winter
coming
on
and
all
and
never
own
the
like
of
a
pair
of
shoes
why
you
please
to
say
so
i
said
a
word
of
it
three
and
four
weeks
gone
that
i
needed
shoes
but
never
sign
of
a
shoe
to
this
day
and
here
i
am
said
isak
what
wrong
with
your
pattens
then
that
you
ca
use
them
what
wrong
with
them
repeats
oline
all
unprepared
ay
that
what
i
like
to
know
with
my
pattens
ay
well
and
me
carding
and
spinning
and
tending
cattle
and
sheep
and
all
looking
after
children
here
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
that
i
like
to
know
that
wife
of
yours
that
in
prison
for
her
deeds
did
you
let
her
go
barefoot
in
the
snow
she
wore
her
pattens
said
isak
and
for
going
to
church
and
visiting
and
the
like
why
rough
hide
was
good
enough
for
her
ay
and
all
the
finer
for
it
no
doubt
ay
that
she
was
and
when
she
did
wear
her
hide
shoes
in
summer
she
did
but
stuff
a
wisp
of
grass
in
them
and
never
no
more
but
you
you
must
wear
stockings
in
your
shoes
all
the
year
round
said
oline
as
for
that
i
wear
out
my
pattens
in
time
no
doubt
i
no
thought
there
was
any
such
haste
to
wear
out
good
pattens
all
at
once
she
spake
softly
and
gently
but
with
eyes
the
same
sly
oline
as
ever
and
as
for
inger
said
she
the
changeling
as
we
called
her
she
went
about
with
children
of
mine
and
learned
both
this
and
that
for
years
she
did
and
this
is
what
we
get
for
it
because
i
a
daughter
that
lives
in
bergen
and
wears
a
hat
i
suppose
that
what
inger
must
be
gone
away
south
for
gone
to
trondhjem
to
buy
a
hat
he
he
isak
got
up
to
leave
the
room
but
oline
had
opened
her
heart
now
unlocked
the
store
of
blackness
within
ay
she
gave
out
rays
of
darkness
did
oline
thank
heaven
none
of
her
children
had
their
faces
slit
like
a
dragon
so
to
speak
but
they
were
none
the
worse
for
that
maybe
no
was
every
one
was
so
quick
and
handy
at
getting
rid
of
the
young
they
bore
strangling
them
in
a
twinkling
mind
what
you
saying
shouted
isak
and
to
make
his
meaning
perfectly
clear
he
added
you
cursed
old
hag
but
oline
was
not
going
to
mind
what
she
was
saying
not
in
the
least
he
he
she
turned
up
her
eyes
to
heaven
and
hinted
that
a
might
be
this
or
that
but
some
folk
seemed
to
carry
it
too
far
he
he
isak
may
well
have
been
glad
to
get
safely
out
of
the
house
at
last
and
what
could
he
do
but
get
oline
the
shoes
a
tiller
of
earth
in
the
wilds
no
longer
even
something
of
a
god
that
he
could
say
to
his
servant
go
he
was
helpless
without
oline
whatever
she
did
or
said
she
had
nothing
to
fear
and
she
knew
it
the
nights
are
colder
now
with
a
full
moon
the
marshlands
harden
till
they
can
almost
bear
but
thawing
again
when
the
sun
comes
out
to
an
impassable
swamp
once
more
isak
goes
down
to
the
village
one
cold
night
to
order
shoes
for
oline
he
takes
a
couple
of
cheeses
with
him
for
fru
geissler
down
to
the
village
a
new
settler
has
appeared
a
man
no
doubt
since
he
had
called
in
folk
from
the
village
to
build
his
house
and
hired
men
to
plough
up
a
patch
of
sandy
moorland
for
potatoes
he
himself
did
little
or
nothing
the
new
man
was
brede
olsen
lensmand
assistant
a
man
to
go
to
when
the
doctor
had
to
be
fetched
or
a
pig
to
be
killed
he
was
not
yet
thirty
but
had
four
children
to
look
after
not
to
speak
of
his
wife
who
was
as
good
as
a
child
herself
oh
brede
was
not
so
well
off
perhaps
after
all
no
great
money
he
could
earn
running
hither
and
thither
on
all
odd
businesses
and
collecting
taxes
from
people
that
would
not
pay
so
now
he
was
trying
a
new
venture
on
the
soil
he
had
raised
a
loan
at
the
bank
to
start
house
in
the
wilds
breidablik
he
called
the
place
and
it
was
lensmand
heyerdahl
lady
that
had
found
that
splendid
name
isak
hurries
past
the
house
not
wasting
time
on
looking
in
but
he
can
see
through
the
window
that
all
the
children
are
up
already
early
as
it
is
isak
has
no
time
to
lose
if
he
is
to
be
back
as
far
as
this
on
the
homeward
journey
next
night
while
the
roads
are
hard
a
man
living
in
the
wilds
has
much
to
think
of
to
reckon
out
and
fit
in
as
best
can
be
it
is
not
the
busiest
time
for
him
just
now
but
he
is
anxious
about
the
children
left
all
alone
with
oline
he
thinks
as
he
walks
of
the
first
time
he
had
come
that
way
time
has
passed
the
two
last
years
had
been
long
there
had
been
much
that
was
good
at
sellanraa
and
a
deal
that
was
not
eyah
and
now
here
was
another
man
clearing
ground
in
the
wilds
isak
knew
the
place
well
it
was
one
of
the
kindlier
spots
he
had
noted
himself
on
his
way
up
but
he
had
gone
on
farther
it
was
nearer
the
village
certainly
but
the
timber
was
not
so
good
the
ground
was
less
hilly
but
a
poorer
soil
easy
to
work
on
the
surface
but
hard
to
deal
with
farther
down
that
fellow
brede
would
find
it
took
more
than
a
mere
turning
over
of
the
soil
to
made
a
field
that
would
bear
and
why
had
he
built
out
a
shed
from
the
end
of
the
hayloft
for
carts
and
implements
isak
noticed
that
a
cart
had
been
left
standing
out
in
the
yard
uncovered
in
the
open
he
got
through
his
business
with
the
shoemaker
and
fru
geissler
having
left
the
place
he
sold
his
cheeses
to
the
man
at
the
store
in
the
evening
he
starts
out
for
home
the
frost
is
getting
harder
now
and
it
is
good
firm
going
but
isak
trudges
heavily
for
all
that
who
could
say
when
geissler
would
be
back
now
that
his
wife
had
gone
maybe
he
would
not
be
coming
at
all
inger
was
far
away
and
time
was
getting
on
he
does
not
look
in
at
brede
on
the
way
back
on
the
contrary
he
goes
a
long
way
round
keeping
away
from
the
place
he
does
not
care
to
stop
and
talk
to
folk
only
trudge
on
brede
cart
is
still
out
in
the
open
does
he
mean
to
leave
it
there
well
is
his
own
affair
isak
himself
had
a
cart
of
his
own
now
and
a
shed
to
house
it
but
none
the
happier
for
that
his
home
is
but
half
a
thing
it
had
been
a
home
once
but
now
only
half
a
thing
it
is
full
day
by
the
time
he
gets
within
sight
of
his
own
place
up
on
the
hillside
and
it
cheers
him
somewhat
weary
and
exhausted
as
he
is
after
hours
on
the
road
the
house
and
buildings
there
they
stand
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimney
both
the
little
ones
are
out
and
come
down
to
meet
him
as
he
appears
he
goes
into
the
house
and
finds
a
couple
of
lapps
sitting
down
oline
starts
up
in
surprise
what
you
back
already
she
is
making
coffee
on
the
stove
coffee
isak
has
noticed
the
same
thing
before
when
or
any
of
the
other
lapps
have
been
there
oline
makes
coffee
in
inger
little
pot
for
a
long
time
after
she
does
it
while
isak
is
out
in
the
woods
or
in
the
fields
and
when
he
comes
in
unexpectedly
and
sees
it
she
says
nothing
but
he
knows
that
he
is
the
poorer
by
a
cheese
or
a
bundle
of
wool
each
time
and
it
is
to
his
credit
that
he
does
not
pick
up
oline
in
his
fingers
and
crush
her
to
pieces
for
her
meanness
altogether
isak
is
trying
hard
indeed
to
make
himself
a
better
man
better
and
better
whatever
may
be
his
idea
whether
it
be
for
the
sake
of
peace
in
the
house
or
in
some
hope
that
the
lord
may
give
him
back
his
inger
the
sooner
he
is
something
given
to
superstition
and
a
pondering
upon
things
even
his
rustic
wariness
is
innocent
in
its
way
early
that
autumn
he
found
the
turf
on
the
roof
of
the
stable
was
beginning
to
slip
down
inside
isak
chewed
at
his
beard
for
a
while
then
smiling
like
a
man
who
understands
a
jest
he
laid
some
poles
across
to
keep
it
up
not
a
bitter
word
did
he
say
and
another
thing
the
shed
where
he
kept
his
store
of
provisions
was
simply
built
on
high
stone
feet
at
the
corners
with
nothing
between
after
a
while
little
birds
began
to
find
their
way
in
through
the
big
gaps
in
the
wall
and
stayed
fluttering
about
inside
unable
to
get
out
oline
complained
that
they
picked
at
the
food
and
spoiled
the
meat
and
made
a
nasty
mess
about
the
place
isak
said
ay
is
a
pity
small
birds
should
come
in
and
not
be
able
to
get
out
again
and
in
the
thick
of
a
busy
season
he
turned
stonemason
and
filled
up
the
gaps
in
the
wall
heaven
knows
what
was
in
his
mind
that
he
took
things
so
whether
maybe
he
fancied
inger
might
be
given
back
to
him
the
sooner
for
his
gentleness
chapter
ix
the
years
pass
by
once
more
there
came
visitors
to
sellanraa
an
engineer
with
a
foreman
and
a
couple
of
workmen
marking
out
telegraph
lines
again
over
the
hills
by
the
route
they
were
taking
now
the
line
would
be
carried
a
little
above
the
house
and
a
straight
road
cut
through
the
forest
no
harm
in
that
it
would
make
the
place
less
desolate
a
glimpse
of
the
world
would
make
it
brighter
this
place
said
the
engineer
will
be
just
about
midway
between
two
lines
through
the
valleys
on
either
side
they
very
likely
ask
you
to
take
on
the
job
of
linesman
for
both
ho
said
isak
it
will
be
a
year
in
your
pocket
h
said
isak
and
what
am
i
to
do
for
that
keep
the
line
in
repair
mend
the
wires
when
necessary
clear
away
forest
growth
on
the
route
as
it
comes
up
they
set
up
a
little
machine
thing
in
the
house
here
to
hang
on
the
wall
that
tell
you
when
you
wanted
and
when
it
does
you
must
leave
whatever
doing
and
go
isak
thought
it
over
i
could
do
it
all
right
in
winter
he
said
that
no
good
it
would
have
to
be
for
the
whole
year
summer
and
winter
alike
ca
be
done
said
isak
spring
and
summer
and
autumn
i
my
work
on
the
land
and
no
time
for
other
things
the
engineer
looked
at
him
for
quite
a
while
and
then
put
an
astonishing
question
as
follows
can
you
make
more
money
that
way
make
more
money
said
isak
can
you
earn
more
money
in
a
day
by
working
on
the
land
than
you
could
by
working
for
us
why
as
to
that
i
ca
say
answered
isak
it
just
this
way
you
see
is
the
land
i
here
for
i
many
souls
and
more
beasts
to
keep
alive
and
is
the
land
that
keeps
us
is
our
living
if
you
wo
i
can
find
some
one
else
said
the
engineer
but
isak
only
seemed
rather
relieved
at
the
threat
he
did
not
like
to
disoblige
the
great
man
and
tried
to
explain
is
this
way
he
said
i
a
horse
and
five
cows
besides
the
bull
i
twenty
sheep
and
sixteen
goats
the
beasts
they
give
us
food
and
wool
and
hide
we
must
give
them
food
yes
yes
of
course
said
the
other
shortly
well
and
so
i
say
how
am
i
to
feed
them
when
i
to
run
away
all
times
in
the
busy
season
to
work
on
the
telegraph
line
say
no
more
about
it
said
the
engineer
i
get
the
man
down
below
you
brede
olsen
he
be
glad
to
take
it
he
turned
to
his
men
with
a
brief
word
now
lads
we
be
getting
on
now
oline
had
heard
from
the
way
isak
spoke
that
he
was
and
unreasonable
in
his
mind
and
she
would
make
the
most
of
it
what
was
that
you
said
isak
sixteen
goats
there
no
more
than
fifteen
said
she
isak
looked
at
her
and
oline
looked
at
him
again
straight
in
the
face
not
sixteen
goats
said
he
no
said
she
looking
helplessly
towards
the
strangers
as
if
to
say
how
unreasonable
he
was
ho
said
isak
softly
he
drew
a
tuft
of
his
beard
between
his
teeth
and
stood
chewing
it
the
engineer
and
his
men
went
on
their
way
now
if
isak
had
wanted
to
show
his
displeasure
with
oline
and
maybe
thrash
her
for
her
doings
here
was
his
chance
a
chance
to
do
that
thing
they
were
alone
in
the
house
the
children
had
gone
after
the
men
when
they
went
isak
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
oline
was
sitting
by
the
stove
isak
cleared
his
throat
once
or
twice
just
to
show
that
he
was
ready
to
say
something
if
he
pleased
but
he
said
nothing
that
was
his
strength
of
soul
what
did
he
not
know
the
number
of
his
goats
as
he
knew
the
fingers
on
his
hands
was
the
woman
mad
could
one
of
the
beasts
be
missing
when
he
knew
every
one
of
them
personally
and
talked
to
them
every
day
his
goats
that
were
sixteen
in
number
oline
must
have
traded
away
one
of
them
the
day
before
when
the
woman
from
breidablik
had
come
up
to
look
at
the
place
h
said
isak
and
this
time
words
were
on
the
very
tip
of
his
tongue
what
was
it
oline
had
done
not
exactly
murder
perhaps
but
something
not
far
from
it
he
could
speak
in
deadly
earnest
of
that
sixteenth
goat
but
he
could
not
stand
there
for
ever
in
the
middle
of
the
room
saying
nothing
h
he
said
ho
so
there
but
fifteen
goats
there
now
you
say
that
all
i
make
it
answered
oline
gently
but
you
better
count
for
yourself
and
see
now
was
his
time
he
could
do
it
now
reach
out
with
his
hands
and
alter
the
shape
of
oline
considerably
with
but
one
good
grip
he
could
do
it
he
did
not
do
it
but
said
boldly
making
for
the
door
i
say
no
more
just
now
and
he
went
out
as
if
plainly
showing
that
next
time
he
would
have
proper
words
to
say
never
fear
eleseus
he
called
out
where
was
eleseus
where
were
the
children
their
father
had
something
to
ask
them
they
were
big
fellows
now
with
their
eyes
about
them
he
found
them
under
the
floor
of
the
barn
they
had
crept
in
as
far
as
they
could
hiding
away
invisibly
but
betraying
themselves
by
an
anxious
whispering
out
they
crept
now
like
two
sinners
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
eleseus
had
found
a
stump
of
coloured
pencil
the
engineer
had
left
behind
and
started
to
run
after
him
and
give
it
back
but
the
big
men
with
their
long
strides
were
already
far
up
in
the
forest
eleseus
stopped
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
keep
the
pencil
if
only
he
could
he
hunted
out
little
sivert
so
that
they
might
at
least
be
two
to
share
the
guilt
and
the
pair
of
them
had
crept
in
under
the
floor
with
their
find
oh
that
stump
of
pencil
it
was
an
event
in
their
lives
a
wonder
they
found
shavings
and
covered
them
all
over
with
signs
the
pencil
they
discovered
made
blue
marks
with
one
end
and
red
with
the
other
and
they
took
it
in
turns
to
use
when
their
father
called
out
so
loudly
and
insistently
eleseus
whispered
they
come
back
for
the
pencil
all
their
joy
was
dashed
in
a
moment
swept
out
of
their
minds
at
a
touch
and
their
little
hearts
began
beating
and
thumping
terribly
the
brothers
crept
forth
eleseus
held
out
the
pencil
at
arm
length
here
it
was
they
had
not
broken
it
only
wished
they
had
never
seen
the
thing
no
engineer
was
to
be
seen
their
hearts
settled
to
a
quieter
beat
it
was
heavenly
to
be
rid
of
that
dreadful
tension
there
was
a
woman
here
yesterday
said
their
father
yes
the
woman
from
the
place
down
below
did
you
see
her
go
yes
had
she
a
goat
with
her
no
said
the
boys
a
goat
did
she
have
a
goat
with
her
when
she
left
no
what
goat
isak
wondered
and
wondered
in
the
evening
when
the
animals
came
home
he
counted
the
goats
once
over
there
were
sixteen
he
counted
them
once
more
counted
them
five
times
there
were
sixteen
none
missing
isak
breathed
again
but
what
did
it
all
mean
oline
miserable
creature
could
she
count
as
far
as
sixteen
he
asked
her
angrily
what
all
this
nonsense
there
sixteen
goats
are
there
sixteen
she
asked
innocently
ay
ay
well
then
a
nice
one
to
count
you
are
oline
answered
quietly
in
an
injured
tone
since
all
the
goats
are
there
why
then
thank
heaven
you
ca
say
oline
been
eating
them
up
and
well
for
her
poor
thing
oline
had
taken
him
in
completely
with
her
trickery
he
was
content
imagining
all
was
well
it
did
not
occur
to
him
for
instance
to
count
the
sheep
he
did
not
trouble
about
further
counting
of
the
stock
at
all
after
all
oline
was
not
as
bad
as
she
might
have
been
she
kept
house
for
him
after
a
fashion
and
looked
to
his
cattle
she
was
merely
a
fool
and
that
was
worst
for
herself
let
her
stay
let
her
live
she
was
not
worth
troubling
about
but
it
was
a
grey
and
joyless
thing
to
be
isak
as
life
was
now
years
had
passed
grass
had
grown
on
the
roof
of
the
house
even
the
roof
of
the
barn
which
was
some
years
younger
was
green
the
wild
mouse
native
of
the
woods
had
long
since
found
way
into
the
storehouse
tits
and
all
manner
of
little
birds
swarmed
about
the
place
there
were
more
birds
up
on
the
hillside
even
the
crows
had
come
and
most
wonderful
of
all
the
summer
before
seagulls
had
appeared
seagulls
coming
all
the
way
up
from
the
coast
to
settle
on
the
fields
there
in
the
wilderness
isak
farm
was
known
far
and
wide
to
all
wild
creatures
and
what
of
eleseus
and
little
sivert
when
they
saw
the
gulls
oh
was
some
strange
birds
from
ever
so
far
away
not
so
many
of
them
just
six
white
birds
all
exactly
alike
waddling
this
way
and
that
about
the
fields
and
pecking
at
the
grass
now
and
then
father
what
have
they
come
for
asked
the
boys
there
foul
weather
coming
out
at
sea
said
their
father
oh
a
grand
and
mysterious
thing
to
see
those
gulls
and
isak
taught
his
sons
many
other
things
good
and
useful
to
know
they
were
of
an
age
to
go
to
school
but
the
school
was
many
miles
away
down
in
the
village
out
of
reach
isak
had
himself
taught
the
boys
their
a
b
c
on
sundays
but
was
not
for
him
not
for
this
born
tiller
of
the
soil
to
give
them
any
manner
of
higher
education
the
catechism
and
bible
history
lay
quietly
on
the
shelf
with
the
cheeses
isak
apparently
thought
it
better
for
men
to
grow
up
without
from
the
way
he
dealt
with
his
boys
they
were
a
joy
and
a
blessing
to
him
the
two
many
a
time
he
thought
of
the
days
when
they
had
been
tiny
things
and
their
mother
would
not
let
him
touch
them
because
his
hands
were
sticky
with
resin
ho
resin
the
cleanest
thing
in
the
world
tar
and
goats
milk
and
marrow
for
instance
all
excellent
things
but
resin
clean
gum
from
the
fir
not
a
word
so
the
lads
grew
up
in
a
paradise
of
dirt
and
ignorance
but
they
were
nice
lads
for
all
that
when
they
were
washed
which
happened
now
and
again
little
sivert
he
was
a
splendid
fellow
though
eleseus
was
something
finer
and
deeper
how
do
the
gulls
know
about
the
weather
he
asked
they
said
his
father
but
as
for
that
they
no
more
so
than
the
flies
how
it
may
be
with
flies
i
ca
say
if
they
get
the
gout
or
feel
giddy
or
what
but
never
hit
out
at
a
fly
for
only
make
him
worse
remember
that
boys
the
horsefly
a
different
sort
he
dies
of
himself
turns
up
suddenly
one
day
in
summer
and
there
he
is
then
one
day
suddenly
he
gone
and
the
end
of
him
but
how
does
he
die
asked
eleseus
the
fat
inside
him
stiffens
and
he
lies
there
dead
every
day
they
learned
something
new
jumping
down
from
high
rocks
for
instance
to
keep
your
tongue
in
your
mouth
and
not
get
it
between
your
teeth
when
they
grew
bigger
and
wanted
to
smell
nice
for
going
to
church
the
thing
was
to
rub
oneself
with
a
little
tansy
that
grew
on
the
hillside
father
was
full
of
wisdom
he
taught
the
boys
about
stones
about
flint
how
that
the
white
stone
was
harder
than
the
grey
but
when
he
had
found
a
flint
he
must
also
make
tinder
then
he
could
strike
fire
with
it
he
taught
them
about
the
moon
how
when
you
can
grip
in
the
hollow
side
with
your
left
hand
it
is
waxing
and
grip
in
with
the
right
it
on
the
wane
remember
that
boys
now
and
again
isak
would
go
too
far
and
grow
mysterious
one
friday
he
declared
that
it
was
harder
for
a
camel
to
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
than
for
a
human
being
to
thread
the
eye
of
a
needle
another
time
telling
them
of
the
glory
of
the
angels
he
explained
that
angels
had
stars
set
in
their
heels
instead
of
good
and
simple
teaching
well
fitted
for
settlers
in
the
wilds
the
schoolmaster
in
the
village
would
have
laughed
at
it
all
but
isak
boys
found
good
use
for
it
in
their
inner
life
they
were
trained
and
taught
for
their
own
little
world
and
what
could
be
better
in
the
autumn
when
animals
were
to
be
killed
the
lads
were
greatly
curious
and
fearful
and
heavy
at
heart
for
the
ones
that
were
to
die
there
was
isak
holding
with
one
hand
and
the
other
ready
to
strike
oline
stirred
the
blood
the
old
goat
was
led
out
bearded
and
wise
the
boys
stood
peeping
round
the
corner
filthy
cold
wind
this
time
said
eleseus
and
turned
away
to
wipe
his
eyes
little
sivert
cried
more
openly
could
not
help
calling
out
oh
poor
old
goat
when
the
goat
was
killed
isak
came
up
to
them
and
gave
them
this
lesson
never
stand
around
saying
thing
and
being
pitiful
when
things
are
being
killed
it
makes
them
tough
and
harder
to
kill
remember
that
so
the
years
passed
and
now
it
was
nearing
spring
again
inger
had
written
home
to
say
she
was
well
and
was
learning
a
lot
of
things
where
she
was
her
little
girl
was
big
and
was
called
leopoldine
after
the
day
she
was
born
the
november
she
knew
all
sorts
of
things
and
was
a
genius
at
hemstitch
and
crochet
wonderful
fine
work
she
could
do
on
linen
or
canvas
the
curious
thing
about
this
letter
was
that
inger
had
written
and
spelt
it
all
herself
isak
was
not
so
learned
but
that
he
had
to
get
it
read
for
him
down
in
the
village
by
the
man
at
the
store
but
once
he
had
got
it
into
his
head
it
stayed
there
he
knew
it
off
by
heart
when
he
got
home
and
now
he
sat
down
with
great
solemnity
at
the
head
of
the
table
spread
out
the
letter
and
read
it
aloud
to
the
boys
he
was
willing
enough
that
oline
also
should
see
how
easily
he
could
read
writing
but
he
did
not
speak
so
much
as
a
word
to
her
directly
when
he
had
finished
he
said
there
now
eleseus
and
you
sivert
is
your
mother
herself
has
written
that
letter
and
learned
all
these
things
even
that
little
tiny
sister
of
yours
she
knows
more
than
all
the
rest
of
us
here
remember
that
the
boys
sat
still
wondering
in
silence
ay
is
a
grand
thing
said
oline
and
what
did
she
mean
by
that
was
she
doubting
that
inger
told
the
truth
or
had
she
her
suspicions
as
to
isak
reading
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
get
at
what
oline
really
thought
when
she
sat
there
with
her
simple
face
saying
dark
things
isak
determined
to
take
no
notice
and
when
your
mother
comes
home
boys
you
shall
learn
to
write
too
said
he
to
the
lads
oline
shifted
some
clothes
that
were
hanging
near
the
stove
to
dry
shifted
a
pot
shifted
the
clothes
again
and
busied
herself
generally
she
was
thinking
all
the
time
so
fine
and
grand
as
everything
getting
here
she
said
at
last
i
do
think
you
might
have
bought
a
paper
of
coffee
for
the
house
said
isak
it
slipped
out
oline
answered
quietly
up
to
now
i
bought
a
little
now
and
again
out
of
my
own
money
but
coffee
was
a
thing
of
dreams
and
fairy
tales
for
isak
a
rainbow
oline
was
talking
nonsense
of
course
he
was
not
angry
with
her
no
but
slow
of
thought
as
he
was
he
called
to
mind
at
last
her
bartering
with
the
lapps
and
he
said
bitterly
ay
i
buy
you
coffee
that
i
will
a
paper
of
coffee
was
it
why
not
a
pound
a
pound
of
coffee
while
you
about
it
no
need
to
talk
that
way
isak
my
brother
nils
he
gets
coffee
down
at
breidablik
too
they
coffee
ay
for
they
no
milk
not
a
drop
of
milk
on
the
place
not
that
as
it
may
be
but
you
that
know
such
a
lot
and
read
writing
as
pat
as
a
cockroach
running
you
ought
to
know
that
coffee
a
thing
should
be
in
everybody
house
you
creature
said
isak
at
that
oline
sat
down
and
was
not
to
be
silenced
as
for
that
inger
said
she
if
so
be
i
may
dare
to
say
such
a
word
say
what
you
will
is
all
one
to
me
she
be
coming
home
and
learned
everything
of
sorts
and
beads
and
feathers
in
her
hat
maybe
ay
that
may
be
ay
said
oline
and
she
can
thank
me
a
little
for
all
the
way
grown
so
fine
and
grand
you
asked
isak
it
slipped
out
oline
answered
humbly
ay
since
was
my
modest
doing
that
she
ever
went
away
isak
was
speechless
at
that
all
his
words
were
checked
he
sat
there
staring
had
he
heard
aright
oline
sat
there
looking
as
if
she
had
said
nothing
no
in
a
battle
of
words
isak
was
altogether
lost
he
swung
out
of
the
house
full
of
dark
thoughts
oline
that
beast
that
throve
in
wickedness
and
grew
fat
on
it
why
had
he
not
wrung
her
neck
the
first
year
so
he
thought
trying
to
pull
himself
together
he
could
have
done
it
he
could
he
though
no
one
better
and
then
a
ridiculous
thing
happened
isak
went
into
the
shed
and
counted
the
goats
there
they
are
with
their
kids
the
full
number
he
counts
the
cows
the
pig
fourteen
hens
two
calves
i
all
but
forgotten
the
sheep
he
says
to
himself
he
counts
the
sheep
and
pretends
to
be
all
anxiety
lest
there
should
be
any
missing
there
isak
knows
very
well
that
there
is
a
sheep
missing
he
has
known
that
a
long
time
why
should
he
let
it
appear
otherwise
it
was
this
way
oline
had
tricked
him
nicely
once
before
saying
one
of
the
goats
was
gone
though
all
the
goats
were
there
as
they
should
be
he
had
made
a
great
fuss
about
it
at
the
time
but
to
no
purpose
it
was
always
the
same
when
he
came
into
conflict
with
oline
then
in
the
autumn
at
slaughtering
time
he
had
seen
at
once
that
there
was
one
ewe
short
but
he
had
not
found
courage
to
call
her
to
account
for
it
at
the
time
and
he
had
not
found
that
courage
since
but
today
he
is
stern
isak
is
stern
oline
has
made
him
thoroughly
angry
this
time
he
counts
the
sheep
over
again
putting
his
forefinger
on
each
and
counting
aloud
oline
may
hear
it
if
she
likes
if
she
should
happen
to
be
outside
and
he
says
many
hard
things
about
oline
says
them
out
loud
how
that
she
uses
a
new
method
of
her
own
in
feeding
sheep
a
method
that
simply
makes
them
vanish
here
a
ewe
simply
vanished
she
is
a
thieving
baggage
nothing
less
and
she
may
know
it
oh
he
would
just
have
liked
oline
to
be
standing
outside
and
hear
it
and
be
thoroughly
frightened
for
once
he
strides
out
from
the
shed
goes
to
the
stable
and
counts
the
horse
from
there
he
will
go
in
will
go
into
the
house
and
speak
his
mind
he
walks
so
fast
that
his
shirt
stands
out
like
a
very
angry
shirt
behind
him
but
oline
as
like
as
not
has
noticed
something
looking
out
through
the
glass
window
she
appears
in
the
doorway
quietly
and
steadily
with
buckets
in
her
hands
on
her
way
to
the
cowshed
what
have
you
done
with
that
ewe
with
the
flat
ears
he
asks
ewe
she
asks
ay
if
she
been
here
she
have
had
two
lambs
by
now
what
have
you
done
with
them
she
always
had
two
you
done
me
out
of
three
together
do
you
understand
oline
is
altogether
overwhelmed
altogether
annihilated
by
the
accusation
she
wags
her
head
and
her
legs
seem
to
melt
away
under
her
she
might
fall
and
hurt
herself
her
head
is
busy
all
the
time
her
ready
wit
had
always
helped
her
always
served
her
well
it
must
not
fail
her
now
i
steal
goats
and
i
steal
the
sheep
she
says
quietly
and
what
do
i
do
with
them
i
should
like
to
know
i
do
eat
them
up
all
by
myself
i
suppose
you
know
best
what
you
do
with
them
ho
as
if
i
did
have
enough
and
to
spare
of
meat
and
food
and
all
with
what
you
give
me
isak
that
i
should
have
to
steal
more
but
i
say
that
anyway
i
never
needed
so
much
all
these
years
well
what
have
you
done
with
the
sheep
has
had
it
oline
has
to
set
down
the
buckets
and
fold
her
hands
may
i
never
have
more
guilt
to
answer
for
what
all
this
about
a
ewe
and
lambs
you
talking
of
is
it
the
goat
you
mean
with
the
flat
ears
you
creature
said
isak
turning
away
well
if
you
not
a
miracle
isak
i
will
say
here

all
you
could
wish
for
every
sort
and
a
heavenly
host
of
sheep
and
goats
and
all
in
your
own
shed
and
you
not
enough
how
should
i
know
what
sheep
and
what
two
lambs
you
trying
to
get
out
of
me
now
you
should
be
thanking
the
lord
for
his
mercies
from
generation
to
generation

you
should

but
this
summer
and
a
bit
of
a

lambing
season

more

times

woman
oline
isak
went
off
grumbling
like
a
bear
fool
i
was
not

murder
her
the
first
day
he
thought
calling
himself
all
manner
of
names

of
rubbish

i
was
but
it
not
too
late

just
wait

foot

rich
high
boots
with
broad
shiny
tops

gloves

wore
and
was
elegant
to
see
a

a
matter
of
fact
to
buy

into
the
little
room
nevertheless
and
closed
the
door
oline
stood
in
the
kitchen
and
could
hear
nothing
geissler
sat
down
slapped
his
knee
with
a
powerful
hand
and
there
he
was
master
of
isak
fate
you
have
sold
that
copper
tract
yet
he
asked
no
good
i
buy
it
myself
yes
i
seen
inger
and
some
other
people
too
she
be
out
before
long
if
i
not
greatly
mistaken
the
case
has
been
submitted
to
the
king
the
king
the
king
yes
i
went
in
to
have
a
talk
with
your
wife
they
managed
it
for
me
of
course
no
difficulty
about
that
and
we
had
a
long
talk
inger
how
are
you
getting
on
nicely
what
no
cause
to
complain
like
to
be
home
again
i
not
say
no
so
you
shall
before
very
long
said
i
and
i
tell
you
this
much
isak
she
a
good
girl
is
inger
no
blubbering
not
so
much
as
a
tear
but
smiling
and
laughing
they
fixed
up
that
trouble
with
her
mouth
by
the
way
operation
sewed
it
up
again
then
said
i
wo
be
here
very
long
i
promise
you
that
then
i
went
to
the
governor
he
saw
me
of
course
no
difficulty
about
that
a
woman
here
said
i
that
ought
to
be
out
of
the
place
and
back
in
her
home
inger
sellanraa
said
he
yes
she
a
good
sort
i
wish
we
could
keep
her
for
twenty
years
said
he
you
wo
said
i
been
here
too
long
already
long
says
he
you
know
what
she
in
for
know
all
about
it
says
i
lensmand
in
the
district
says
he
you
sit
down
quite
the
proper
thing
to
say
of
course
says
the
governor
then
do
what
we
can
for
her
here
and
her
little
girl
too
so
she
from
your
part
of
the
country
is
she
we
helped
her
to
get
a
of
her
own
gone
through
the
workshops
right
to
the
top
and
we
taught
her
a
deal
weaving
household
work
dyeing
cutting
out
been
here
too
long
you
say
well
i
got
my
answer
ready
for
that
all
right
but
it
could
wait
so
i
only
said
her
case
had
been
badly
muddled
and
had
to
be
taken
up
again
now
after
the
revision
of
the
criminal
code
she
probably
have
been
acquitted
altogether
and
i
told
him
about
the
hare
hare
says
the
governor
hare
says
i
the
child
was
born
with
a
says
he
smiling
see
and
you
think
they
ought
to
have
made
more
allowance
for
that
did
make
any
at
all
said
i
it
was
mentioned
i
dare
say
it
not
so
bad
after
all
enough
for
her
anyway
you
believe
a
hare
can
work
miracles
then
says
he
to
that
said
i
a
hare
can
work
miracles
or
not
a
matter
i
wo
discuss
just
now
the
question
is
what
effect
the
of
a
hare
might
have
on
a
woman
with
her
disfigurement
in
her
condition
well
he
thought
over
that
for
a
bit
says
he
at
last
maybe
anyhow
we
not
concerned
with
that
here
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
take
over
the
people
they
send
us
not
to
revise
their
sentences
and
according
to
her
sentence
inger
not
yet
finished
her
time
well
then
i
started
on
what
i
wanted
to
say
all
along
was
a
serious
oversight
made
in
bringing
her
here
to
begin
with
said
i
oversight
in
the
first
place
she
ought
never
to
have
been
sent
across
the
country
at
all
in
the
state
she
was
in
he
looks
at
me
stiffly
that
perfectly
true
says
he
it
nothing
to
do
with
us
here
you
know
in
the
second
place
said
i
ought
certainly
not
to
have
been
in
the
prison
for
full
two
months
without
any
notice
taken
of
her
condition
by
the
authorities
here
that
put
him
out
i
could
see
he
said
nothing
for
quite
a
while
you
instructed
to
act
on
her
behalf
says
he
at
last
i
am
said
i
well
then
he
started
on
about
how
pleased
they
had
been
with
her
and
telling
me
over
again
all
they
taught
her
and
done
for
her
there
taught
her
to
write
too
he
said
and
the
little
girl
had
been
put
out
to
nurse
with
decent
people
and
so
on
then
i
told
him
how
things
were
at
home
with
inger
away
two
youngsters
left
behind
and
only
a
hired
woman
to
look
after
them
and
all
the
rest
a
statement
from
her
husband
said
i
i
can
submit
whether
the
case
be
taken
up
for
thorough
revision
or
an
application
be
made
for
a
pardon
like
to
see
that
statement
says
the
governor
said
i
bring
it
along
tomorrow
in
visiting
hours
isak
sat
listening
it
was
thrilling
to
hear
a
wonderful
tale
from
foreign
parts
he
followed
geissler
mouth
with
slavish
eyes
geissler
went
on
i
went
straight
back
to
the
hotel
and
wrote
out
a
statement
did
the
whole
thing
myself
you
understand
and
signed
it
sellanraa
do
imagine
though
i
said
a
word
against
the
way
they
managed
things
in
the
prison
not
a
word
next
day
i
went
along
with
the
paper
you
sit
down
says
the
governor
the
moment
i
got
inside
the
door
he
read
through
what
i
written
nodded
here
and
there
and
at
last
he
says
good
very
good
indeed
it
hardly
do
perhaps
to
have
the
case
brought
up
again
for
revision
but
a
bit
said
i
another
document
that
i
think
will
make
it
right
had
him
there
again
you
see
he
says
all
of
a
hurry
been
thinking
over
the
matter
since
yesterday
and
i
consider
there
good
and
sufficient
grounds
to
apply
for
a
pardon
the
application
would
have
the
governor
support
i
asked
yes
i
give
it
my
best
recommendation
then
i
bowed
and
said
that
case
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
the
pardon
of
course
i
thank
you
sir
on
behalf
of
a
suffering
woman
and
a
stricken
home
then
says
he
do
think
there
should
be
any
need
of
further
declarations
from
the
district
i
mean
about
her
case
you
know
the
woman
yourself
that
should
be
quite
enough
i
knew
well
enough
of
course
why
he
wanted
the
thing
settled
quietly
as
possible
so
i
just
agreed
said
it
would
only
delay
the
proceedings
to
collect
further
material
and
there
you
are
isak
that
the
whole
story
geissler
looked
at
his
watch
and
now
let
get
to
business
can
you
go
with
me
up
to
the
ground
again
isak
was
a
stony
creature
a
stump
of
a
man
he
did
not
find
it
easy
to
change
the
subject
all
at
once
he
was
all
preoccupied
with
thoughts
and
wondering
and
began
asking
questions
of
this
and
that
he
learned
that
the
application
had
been
sent
up
to
the
king
and
might
be
decided
in
one
of
the
first
state
councils
is
all
a
miracle
said
he
then
they
went
up
into
the
hills
geissler
his
man
and
isak
and
were
out
for
some
hours
in
a
very
short
time
geissler
had
followed
the
lie
of
the
copper
vein
over
a
wide
stretch
of
land
and
marked
out
the
limits
of
the
tract
he
wanted
here
there
and
everywhere
he
was
but
no
fool
for
all
his
hasty
movements
quick
to
judge
but
sound
enough
for
all
that
when
they
came
back
to
the
farm
once
more
with
a
sack
full
of
samples
of
ore
he
got
out
writing
materials
and
sat
down
to
write
he
did
not
bury
himself
completely
in
his
writing
though
but
talked
now
and
again
well
isak
it
wo
be
such
a
big
sum
this
time
for
the
land
but
i
can
give
you
a
couple
of
hundred
anyway
on
the
spot
then
he
wrote
again
remind
me
before
i
go
i
want
to
see
that
mill
of
yours
said
he
then
he
caught
sight
of
some
blue
and
red
marks
on
the
frame
of
the
loom
and
asked
who
drew
that
now
that
was
eleseus
had
drawn
a
horse
and
a
goat
he
used
his
coloured
pencil
on
the
loom
and
woodwork
anywhere
having
no
paper
not
at
all
bad
said
geissler
and
gave
eleseus
a
coin
geissler
went
on
writing
for
a
bit
and
then
looked
up
you
be
having
other
people
taking
up
land
hereabouts
before
long
at
this
the
man
with
him
spoke
there
some
started
already
ho
and
who
might
that
be
well
first
there
the
folk
at
breidablik
as
they
call
it
man
brede
at
breidablik
him
puh
sniffed
geissler
contemptuously
then
there
one
or
two
others
besides
have
bought
doubt
if
they
any
good
any
of
them
said
geissler
and
noticing
at
the
same
moment
that
there
were
two
boys
in
the
room
he
caught
hold
of
little
sivert
and
gave
him
a
coin
a
remarkable
man
was
geissler
his
eyes
by
the
way
had
begun
to
look
soreish
there
was
a
kind
of
redness
at
the
edges
might
have
been
sleeplessness
the
same
thing
comes
at
times
from
drinking
of
strong
waters
but
he
did
not
look
dejected
at
all
and
for
all
his
talking
of
this
and
that
between
times
he
was
thinking
no
doubt
of
his
document
all
the
while
for
suddenly
he
picked
up
the
pen
and
wrote
a
piece
more
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
finished
he
turned
to
isak
well
as
i
said
it
wo
make
you
a
rich
man
all
at
once
this
deal
but
there
may
be
more
to
come
we
fix
it
up
so
that
you
get
more
later
on
anyhow
i
can
give
you
two
hundred
now
isak
understood
but
little
of
the
whole
thing
but
two
hundred
was
at
any
rate
another
miracle
and
an
unreasonable
sum
he
would
get
it
on
paper
of
course
not
paid
in
cash
but
let
that
be
isak
had
other
things
in
his
head
just
now
and
you
think
she
be
pardoned
he
asked
eh
oh
your
wife
well
if
there
been
a
telegraph
office
in
the
village
i
have
wired
to
trondhjem
and
asked
if
she
had
been
set
free
already
isak
had
heard
men
speak
of
the
telegraph
a
wonderful
thing
a
string
hung
up
on
big
poles
something
altogether
above
the
common
earth
the
mention
of
it
now
seemed
to
shake
his
faith
in
geissler
big
words
and
he
put
in
anxiously
but
suppose
the
king
says
no
said
geissler
in
that
case
i
send
in
my
supplementary
material
a
full
account
of
the
whole
affair
and
then
they
set
her
free
there
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
then
he
read
over
what
he
had
written
the
contract
for
purchase
of
the
land
two
hundred
cash
down
and
later
a
nice
high
percentage
of
receipts
from
working
or
ultimate
disposal
by
further
sale
of
the
copper
tract
sign
your
name
here
said
geissler
isak
would
have
signed
readily
enough
but
he
was
no
scholar
in
all
his
life
he
had
got
no
farther
than
cutting
initials
in
wood
but
there
was
that
hateful
creature
oline
looking
on
he
took
up
the
pen
a
beastly
thing
too
light
to
handle
anyway
turned
it
right
end
down
and
wrote
his
name
whereupon
geissler
added
something
presumably
an
explanation
and
the
man
he
had
brought
with
him
signed
as
a
witness
settled
but
oline
was
still
there
standing
immovable
it
was
indeed
but
now
she
had
turned
so
stiff
what
was
to
happen
dinner
on
the
table
oline
said
isak
possibly
with
a
tough
of
dignity
after
having
signed
his
name
in
writing
on
a
paper
such
as
we
can
offer
he
added
to
geissler
smells
good
enough
said
geissler
sound
meat
and
drink
here
isak
here
your
money
geissler
took
out
his
thick
and
fat
it
was
too
drew
from
it
two
bundles
of
notes
and
laid
them
down
count
it
over
yourself
not
a
movement
not
a
sound
isak
said
geissler
again
ay
yes
answered
isak
and
murmured
overwhelmed
is
not
that
i
asked
for
it
nor
would
after
all
you
done
ten
tens
in
that
should
be
and
twenty
fives
here
said
geissler
shortly
and
i
hope
there
be
more
than
that
by
a
long
way
for
your
share
soon
and
then
it
was
that
oline
recovered
from
her
trance
the
wonder
had
happened
after
all
she
set
the
food
on
the
table
next
morning
geissler
went
out
to
the
river
to
look
at
the
mill
it
was
small
enough
and
roughly
built
ay
a
mill
for
dwarfs
for
trollfolk
but
strong
and
useful
for
a
man
work
isak
led
his
guest
a
little
farther
up
the
river
and
showed
him
another
fall
he
had
been
working
on
a
bit
it
was
to
turn
a
saw
if
so
be
god
gave
him
health
the
only
thing
he
said
it
a
heavy
long
way
from
school
have
to
get
the
lads
to
stay
down
in
the
village
but
geissler
always
so
quick
to
find
a
way
saw
nothing
to
worry
about
here
there
are
more
people
buying
and
settling
here
now
said
he
it
wo
be
long
before
there
enough
to
start
a
school
ay
maybe
but
not
before
my
boys
are
grown
well
why
not
let
them
live
on
a
farm
down
in
the
village
you
could
drive
in
with
the
boys
and
some
food
and
bring
them
up
again
three
weeks
six
weeks
after
it
would
be
easy
enough
for
you
surely
ay
maybe
said
isak
ay
all
things
would
be
easy
enough
if
inger
came
home
house
and
land
and
food
and
grand
things
enough
and
a
big
sum
of
money
too
he
had
and
his
strength
he
was
hard
as
nails
health
and
strength
ay
full
and
unspoiled
unworn
in
every
way
the
health
and
strength
of
a
man
when
geissler
had
gone
isak
began
thinking
of
many
presumptuous
things
ay
for
had
not
geissler
that
blessing
to
them
all
said
at
parting
that
he
would
send
a
message
very
soon
would
send
a
telegram
as
soon
as
ever
he
could
you
can
call
in
at
the
post
office
in
a
fortnight
time
he
had
said
and
that
in
itself
was
a
wonderful
thing
enough
isak
set
to
work
making
a
seat
for
the
cart
a
seat
of
course
that
could
be
taken
off
when
using
the
cart
for
manure
but
to
be
put
in
again
when
any
one
wanted
to
drive
and
when
he
had
got
the
seat
made
it
looked
so
white
and
new
that
it
had
to
be
painted
darker
as
for
that
there
were
things
enough
that
had
to
be
done
the
whole
place
wanted
painting
to
begin
with
and
he
had
been
thinking
for
years
past
of
building
a
proper
barn
with
a
bridge
to
house
in
the
crop
he
had
thought
too
of
getting
that
saw
set
up
and
finished
of
fencing
in
all
his
cultivated
ground
of
building
a
boat
on
the
lake
up
in
the
hills
many
things
he
had
thought
of
doing
but
hard
as
he
worked
unreasonably
hard
what
did
it
help
against
time
time
it
was
the
time
that
was
too
short
it
was
sunday
before
he
knew
and
then
directly
after
lo
it
was
sunday
again
paint
he
would
in
any
case
that
was
decided
and
emphatic
the
buildings
stood
there
grey
and
bare
stood
there
like
houses
in
their
shirt
sleeves
there
was
time
yet
before
the
busy
season
the
spring
was
hardly
begun
yet
the
young
things
were
out
but
there
was
frost
in
the
ground
still
isak
goes
down
to
the
village
taking
with
him
a
few
score
of
eggs
for
sale
and
brings
back
paint
there
was
enough
for
one
building
for
the
barn
and
it
was
painted
red
he
fetches
up
more
paint
yellow
ochre
this
time
for
the
house
itself
ay
is
as
i
said
going
to
be
fine
and
grand
grumbles
oline
every
day
ay
oline
could
guess
no
doubt
that
her
time
at
sellanraa
would
soon
be
up
she
was
tough
and
strong
enough
to
bear
it
though
not
without
bitterness
isak
on
his
part
no
longer
sought
to
settle
up
old
scores
with
her
now
though
she
pilfered
and
put
away
things
lavishly
enough
towards
the
end
he
made
her
a
present
of
a
young
wether
after
all
she
had
been
with
him
a
long
time
and
worked
for
little
pay
and
oline
had
not
been
so
bad
with
the
children
she
was
not
stern
and
strictly
righteous
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
had
a
knack
of
dealing
with
children
listened
to
what
they
said
and
let
them
do
more
or
less
as
they
pleased
if
they
came
round
while
she
was
making
cheese
she
would
give
them
a
bit
to
taste
if
they
begged
to
be
let
off
washing
their
faces
one
sunday
she
would
let
them
off
when
isak
had
given
his
walls
a
first
coat
he
went
down
to
the
village
again
and
brought
up
all
the
paint
he
could
carry
three
coats
he
put
on
in
all
and
white
on
the
and
corners
to
come
back
now
and
look
at
his
home
there
on
the
hillside
it
was
like
looking
at
a
fairy
palace
the
wilderness
was
inhabited
and
unrecognizable
a
blessing
had
come
upon
it
life
had
arisen
there
from
a
long
dream
human
creatures
lived
there
children
played
about
the
houses
and
the
forest
stretched
away
big
and
kindly
right
up
to
the
blue
heights
but
the
last
time
isak
went
down
for
paint
the
storekeeper
gave
him
a
blue
envelope
with
a
crest
on
and
to
pay
it
was
a
telegram
which
had
been
forwarded
by
post
and
was
from
lensmand
geissler
a
blessing
on
that
man
geissler
wonderful
man
that
he
was
he
telegraphed
these
few
words
that
inger
was
free
home
soonest
possible
geissler
and
at
this
the
store
took
to
whirling
curiously
round
and
round
the
counter
and
the
people
in
the
shop
were
suddenly
far
away
isak
felt
rather
than
heard
himself
saying
and
praise
and
thanks
to
god
she
might
be
here
no
later
than
tomorrow
the
day
said
the
storekeeper
if
so
be
she
left
trondhjem
in
time
ho
said
isak
he
waited
till
the
next
day
the
carrier
came
up
with
letters
from
the
where
the
steamer
put
in
but
no
inger
then
she
wo
be
here
now
till
next
week
the
storekeeper
said
almost
as
well
after
all
that
there
was
time
to
wait
isak
has
many
things
to
do
should
he
forget
himself
altogether
and
neglect
his
land
he
sets
off
home
again
and
begins
carting
out
manure
it
is
soon
done
he
sticks
a
crowbar
into
the
earth
noting
how
the
frost
disappears
from
day
to
day
the
sun
is
big
and
strong
now
the
snow
is
gone
green
showing
everywhere
the
cattle
are
out
to
graze
isak
ploughs
one
day
and
a
few
days
later
he
is
sowing
corn
planting
potatoes
ho
the
youngsters
too
planting
potatoes
like
angels
blessed
little
hands
they
have
and
what
can
their
father
do
but
watch
then
isak
washes
out
the
cart
down
by
the
river
and
puts
the
seat
in
talks
to
the
lads
about
a
little
journey
he
must
have
a
little
journey
down
to
the
village
but
are
you
going
to
walk
not
today
i
took
into
my
head
to
go
down
with
horse
and
cart
today
ca
we
come
too
you
got
to
be
good
boys
and
stay
at
home
this
time
your
own
mother
be
coming
very
soon
and
she
learn
you
a
many
things
eleseus
is
all
for
learning
things
he
asks
father
when
you
did
that
writing
on
the
paper
what
does
it
feel
like
why
is
hardly
to
feel
at
all
just
like
a
bit
of
nothing
in
the
hand
but
does
it
slip
like
on
the
ice
what
slip
the
pen
thing
that
you
write
with
ay
there
the
pen
but
you
have
to
learn
to
steer
it
you
see
but
little
sivert
he
was
of
another
mind
and
said
nothing
about
pens
he
wanted
to
ride
in
the
cart
just
to
sit
up
on
the
seat
before
the
horse
was
put
in
and
drive
like
that
driving
ever
so
fast
in
a
cart
without
a
horse
and
it
was
all
his
doing
that
father
let
them
both
sit
up
and
ride
with
him
a
long
way
down
the
road
chapter
xi
isak
drives
on
till
he
comes
to
a
tarn
a
bit
of
a
pool
on
the
moor
and
there
he
pulls
up
a
pool
on
the
moors
black
deep
down
and
the
little
surface
of
the
water
perfectly
still
isak
knew
what
that
was
good
for
he
had
hardly
used
any
other
mirror
in
his
life
than
such
a
bit
of
water
on
the
moors
look
how
nice
and
neat
he
is
today
with
a
red
shirt
he
takes
out
a
pair
of
scissors
now
and
trims
his
beard
vain
barge
of
a
man
is
he
going
to
make
himself
handsome
all
at
once
and
cut
away
five
years
growth
of
iron
beard
he
cuts
and
cuts
away
looking
at
himself
in
his
glass
he
might
have
done
all
this
at
home
of
course
but
was
shy
of
doing
it
before
oline
it
was
quite
enough
to
stand
there
right
in
front
of
her
nose
and
put
on
a
red
shirt
he
cuts
and
cuts
away
a
certain
amount
of
beard
falls
into
his
patent
mirror
the
horse
grows
impatient
at
last
and
is
moving
on
isak
is
fain
to
be
content
with
himself
as
he
is
and
gets
up
again
and
indeed
he
feels
somehow
younger
already
devil
knows
what
it
could
be
but
somehow
slighter
of
build
isak
drives
down
to
the
village
next
day
the
mail
boat
comes
in
isak
climbs
up
on
a
rock
by
the
storekeeper
wharf
looking
out
but
still
no
inger
to
be
seen
passengers
there
were
folk
and
children
with
them
but
no
inger
he
had
kept
in
the
background
sitting
on
his
rock
but
there
was
no
need
to
stay
behind
any
longer
he
gets
down
and
goes
to
the
steamer
barrels
and
cases
trundling
ashore
people
and
mailbags
but
still
isak
lacked
what
he
had
come
for
there
was
something
there
a
woman
with
a
little
girl
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
already
but
the
woman
was
prettier
to
look
at
than
inger
though
inger
was
good
enough
what
why
but
it
was
inger
h
said
isak
and
trundled
up
to
meet
them
greetings
said
inger
and
held
out
her
hand
a
little
cold
a
little
pale
after
the
voyage
and
being
ill
on
the
way
isak
he
just
stood
there
at
last
he
said
h
is
a
fine
day
and
all
i
saw
you
down
there
all
along
said
inger
but
i
did
want
to
come
crowding
ashore
with
the
rest
so

in
the
village
today
ay
yes

and

voyage
much
better
than

did
this

your
papa
leopoldine

and
shake
hands
nicely
h
said
isak
feeling
very
strange
ay
he
was
like
a
stranger
with
them
all
at
once
said
inger
if
you
find
a
down
by
the
boat
it
be
mine
and
there
a
chest
as
well
off
goes
isak
goes
off
more
than
willingly
after
the
chest
the
men
on
board
showed
him
which
it
was
the
was
another
matter
inger
had
to
go
down
and
find
that
herself
it
was
a
handsome
box
of
curious
shape
with
a
round
cover
over
and
a
handle
to
carry
it
by
a
in
these
parts
isak
hoisted
the
chest
and
the
on
to
his
shoulders
and
turned
to
his
wife
and
child
i
have
these
up
in
no
time
and
come
back
for
her
after
come
back
for
who
asked
inger
with
a
smile
did
you
think
she
could
walk
by
herself
a
big
girl
like
that
they
walked
up
to
where
isak
had
left
the
horse
and
cart
new
horse
you
got
said
inger
and
what
that
you
got
a
cart
with
a
seat
in
tis
but
natural
said
isak
what
i
was
going
to
say
would
you
care
for
a
little
bit
of
something
to
eat
i
brought
things
all
ready
wait
till
we
get
a
bit
on
the
way
said
she
leopoldine
can
you
sit
up
by
yourself
but
her
father
wo
have
it
she
might
fall
down
under
the
wheels
you
sit
up
with
her
and
drive
yourself
so
they
drove
off
isak
walking
behind
he
looked
at
the
two
in
the
cart
as
he
walked
there
was
inger
all
strangely
dressed
and
strange
and
fine
to
look
at
with
no
now
but
only
a
tiny
scar
on
the
upper
lip
no
hissing
when
she
talked
she
spoke
all
clearly
and
that
was
the
wonder
of
it
all
a
woollen
wrap
with
a
fringe
looked
grand
on
her
dark
hair
she
turned
round
in
her
seat
on
the
cart
and
called
to
him
it
a
pity
you
did
bring
a
skin
rug
with
you
it
be
cold
i
doubt
for
the
child
towards
night
she
can
have
my
jacket
said
isak
and
when
we
get
up
in
the
woods
i
left
a
rug
there
on
the
way
oh
have
you
a
rug
up
in
the
woods
ay
i
would
bring
it
down
all
the
way
for
if
you
did
come
today
h
what
was
it
you
said
before
the
boys
are
well
and
all
ay
thank
you
kindly
they
be
big
lads
now
i
doubt
ay
that
true
they
just
been
planting
potatoes
oh
said
the
mother
smiling
and
shaking
her
head
can
they
plant
potatoes
already
why
eleseus
he
gives
a
hand
with
this
and
little
sivert
helps
with
that
said
isak
proudly
little
leopoldine
was
asking
for
something
to
eat
oh
the
pretty
little
creature
a
ladybird
up
on
a
cart
she
talked
with
a
sing
in
her
voice
with
a
strange
accent
as
she
had
learned
in
trondhjem
inger
had
to
translate
now
and
again
she
had
her
brothers
features
the
brown
eyes
and
oval
cheeks
that
all
had
got
from
their
mother
ay
they
were
their
mother
children
and
well
that
they
were
so
isak
was
something
shy
of
his
little
girl
shy
of
her
tiny
shoes
and
long
thin
woollen
stockings
and
short
frock
when
she
had
come
to
meet
her
strange
papa
she
had
curtseyed
and
offered
him
a
tiny
hand
they
got
up
into
the
woods
and
halted
for
a
rest
and
a
meal
all
round
the
horse
had
his
fodder
leopoldine
ran
about
in
the
heather
eating
as
she
went
you
not
changed
much
said
inger
looking
at
her
husband
isak
glanced
aside
and
said
no
you
think
not
but
you
grown
so
grand
and
all
ha
ha
nay
i
an
old
woman
now
said
she
jestingly
it
was
no
use
trying
to
hide
the
fact
isak
was
not
a
bit
sure
of
himself
now
he
could
find
no
but
still
kept
aloof
shy
as
if
ashamed
of
himself
how
old
could
his
wife
be
now
she
could
be
less
than
thirty
that
is
to
say
she
could
be
more
of
course
and
isak
for
all
that
he
was
eating
already
must
pull
up
a
twig
of
heather
and
fall
to
biting
that
what
are
you
eating
heather
cried
inger
laughingly
isak
threw
down
the
twig
took
a
mouthful
of
food
and
going
over
to
the
road
took
the
horse
by
its
forelegs
and
heaved
up
its
forepart
till
the
animal
stood
on
its
hindlegs
inger
looked
on
with
astonishment
what
are
you
doing
that
for
she
asked
oh
he
so
playful
said
isak
and
set
the
horse
down
again
now
what
he
done
that
for
a
sudden
impulse
to
do
just
that
thing
perhaps
he
had
done
it
to
hide
his
embarrassment
they
started
off
again
and
all
three
of
them
walked
a
bit
of
the
way
they
came
to
a
new
farm
what
that
there
asked
inger
is
brede
place
that
he
bought
brede
breidablik
he
calls
it
there
wide
moorland
but
the
poor
they
talked
of
the
new
place
as
they
passed
on
isak
noticed
that
brede
cart
was
still
left
out
in
the
open
the
child
was
growing
sleepy
now
and
isak
took
her
gently
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
they
walked
and
walked
leopoldine
was
soon
fast
asleep
and
inger
said
we
wrap
her
up
in
the
rug
and
she
can
lie
down
in
the
cart
and
sleep
as
long
as
she
likes
shake
her
all
to
pieces
said
isak
and
carries
her
on
they
cross
the
moors
and
get
into
the
woods
again
says
inger
and
the
horse
stops
she
takes
the
child
from
isak
gets
him
to
shift
the
chest
and
the
making
a
place
for
leopoldine
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
shaken
not
a
bit
of
it
isak
fixes
things
to
rights
tucks
his
little
daughter
up
in
the
rug
and
lays
his
jacket
folded
under
her
head
then
off
again
man
and
wife
gossiping
of
this
and
that
the
sun
is
up
till
late
in
the
evening
and
the
weather
warm
oline
says
inger
where
does
she
sleep
in
the
little
room
ho
and
the
boys
they
their
own
bed
in
the
big
room
there
two
beds
there
just
as
when
you
went
away
looking
at
you
now
said
inger
i
can
see
you
just
as
you
were
before
and
those
shoulders
of
yours
they
carried
some
burdens
up
along
this
way
but
they
not
grown
the
weaker
by
it
seems
h
maybe
what
i
was
going
to
say
how
it
was
like
with
you
all
the
years
there
bearable
like
oh
isak
was
soft
at
heart
now
he
asked
her
that
and
wondered
in
his
mind
and
inger
said
ay
was
nothing
to
complain
of
they
talked
more
feelingly
together
and
isak
asked
if
she
tired
of
walking
and
would
get
up
in
the
cart
a
bit
of
way
no
thanks
all
the
same
said
she
but
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
me
today
after
being
ill
on
the
boat
i
feel
hungry
all
the
time
why
did
you
want
something
then
yes
if
you
do
mind
stopping
so
long
oh
that
inger
maybe
was
not
for
herself
at
all
but
for
sake
she
would
have
him
eat
again
he
had
spoiled
his
last
meal
chewing
twigs
of
heather
and
the
evening
was
light
and
warm
and
they
had
but
a
few
miles
more
to
go
they
sat
down
to
eat
again
inger
took
a
parcel
from
her
box
and
said
i
a
few
things
i
brought
along
for
the
boys
let
go
over
there
in
the
bushes
it
warmer
there
they
went
across
to
the
bushes
and
she
showed
him
the
things
neat
braces
with
buckles
for
the
boys
to
wear
with
copies
at
the
top
of
the
page
a
pencil
for
each
a
for
each
and
there
was
an
excellent
book
for
herself
she
had
look
with
my
name
in
and
all
a
it
was
a
present
from
the
governor
by
way
of
remembrance
isak
admired
each
thing
in
silence
she
took
out
a
bundle
of
little
collars
leopoldine
they
were
and
gave
isak
a
black
neckerchief
for
himself
shiny
as
silk
is
that
for
me
said
he
yes
it
for
you
he
took
it
carefully
in
his
hands
and
stroked
it
do
you
think
it
nice
nice
why
i
could
go
round
the
world
in
such
but
isak
fingers
were
rough
they
stuck
in
the
curious
silky
stuff
now
inger
had
no
more
things
to
show
but
when
she
had
packed
them
all
up
again
she
sat
there
still
and
the
way
she
sat
he
could
see
her
legs
could
see
her
stockings
h
said
he
those
be
things
i
doubt
is
wool
was
bought
in
the
town
but
i
knitted
them
myself
ever
so
long
right
up
above
the
knee
look
a
little
while
after
she
heard
herself
whispering
oh
you
just
the
same
the
same
as
ever
and
after
that
halt
they
drove
on
again
and
inger
sat
up
holding
the
reins
i
brought
a
paper
of
coffee
too
she
said
but
you
have
any
this
evening
for
it
not
roasted
yet
is
more
than
needed
this
evening
and
all
said
he
an
hour
later
the
sun
goes
down
and
it
grows
colder
inger
gets
down
to
walk
together
they
tuck
the
rug
closer
about
leopoldine
and
smile
to
see
how
soundly
she
can
sleep
man
and
wife
talk
together
again
on
their
way
a
pleasure
it
is
to
hear
inger
voice
none
could
speak
clearer
than
inger
now
was
it
four
cows
we
had
she
asks
is
more
than
that
says
he
proudly
we
eight
eight
cows
that
is
to
say
counting
the
bull
have
you
sold
any
butter
ay
and
eggs
what
have
we
chickens
now
ay
of
course
we
have
and
a
pig
inger
is
so
astonished
at
all
this
that
she
forgets
herself
altogether
and
stops
for
a
moment
and
isak
is
proud
and
keeps
on
trying
to
overwhelm
her
completely
that
geissler
he
says
you
remember
him
he
came
up
a
little
while
back
oh
i
sold
him
a
copper
mine
ho
what
that
a
copper
mine
copper
yes
up
in
the
hills
all
along
the
north
side
of
the
water
you
you
do
mean
he
paid
you
money
for
it
ay
that
he
did
geissler
he
would
buy
things
and
not
pay
for
them
what
did
you
get
then
h
well
you
might
not
believe
it
but
it
was
two
hundred
you
got
two
hundred
shouts
inger
stopping
again
with
a
i
did
yes
and
i
paid
for
my
land
a
long
while
back
said
isak
well
you
are
a
wonder
you
are
truly
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
inger
all
surprised
and
make
her
a
rich
wife
isak
did
not
forget
to
add
that
he
had
no
debts
nor
owings
at
the
store
or
anywhere
else
and
he
had
not
only
geissler
two
hundred
untouched
but
more
than
that
a
hundred
and
sixty
more
ay
they
might
well
be
thankful
to
god
they
spoke
of
geissler
again
inger
was
able
to
tell
how
he
had
helped
to
get
her
set
free
it
had
not
been
an
easy
matter
for
him
after
all
it
seemed
he
had
been
a
long
time
getting
the
matter
through
and
had
called
on
the
governor
ever
so
many
times
geissler
had
also
written
to
some
of
the
state
councillors
or
some
other
high
authorities
but
this
he
had
done
behind
the
governor
back
and
when
the
governor
heard
of
it
he
was
furious
which
was
not
surprising
but
geissler
was
not
to
be
frightened
he
demanded
a
revision
of
the
case
new
trial
new
examination
and
everything
and
after
that
the
king
had
to
sign
geissler
had
always
been
a
good
friend
to
them
both
and
they
had
often
wondered
why
he
got
nothing
out
of
it
but
their
poor
thanks
it
was
more
than
they
could
understand
inger
had
spoken
with
him
in
trondhjem
and
could
not
make
him
out
he
does
seem
to
care
a
bit
about
any
in
the
village
but
us
she
explained
did
he
say
so
yes
he
furious
with
the
village
here
he
show
them
he
said
ho
and
they
find
out
one
day
and
be
sorry
they
lost
him
he
said
they
reached
the
fringe
of
the
wood
and
came
in
sight
of
their
home
there
were
more
buildings
there
than
before
and
all
nicely
painted
inger
hardly
knew
the
place
again
and
stopped
dead
you
you
do
say
that
our
place
all
that
she
exclaimed
little
leopoldine
woke
at
last
and
sat
up
thoroughly
rested
now
they
lifted
her
out
and
let
her
walk
are
we
there
now
she
asked
yes
is
it
a
pretty
place
there
were
small
figures
moving
over
by
the
house
it
was
eleseus
and
sivert
keeping
watch
now
they
came
running
up
inger
was
seized
with
a
sudden
cold
a
dreadful
cold
in
the
head
with
sniffing
and
coughing
even
her
eyes
were
all
red
and
watering
too
it
always
gives
one
a
dreadful
cold
on
board
ship
makes
one
eyes
wet
and
all
but
when
the
boys
came
nearer
they
stopped
running
all
of
a
sudden
and
stared
they
had
forgotten
what
their
mother
looked
like
and
little
sister
they
had
never
seen
but
father
they
did
know
him
at
all
till
he
came
quite
close
he
had
cut
off
his
heavy
beard
chapter
xii
all
is
well
now
isak
sows
his
oats
harrows
and
rolls
it
in
little
leopoldine
comes
and
wants
to
sit
on
the
roller
sit
on
a
roller
nay
she
all
too
little
and
unknowing
for
that
yet
her
brothers
know
better
no
seat
on
father
roller
but
father
thinks
it
fine
and
a
pleasure
to
see
little
leopoldine
coming
up
so
trustingly
to
him
already
he
talks
to
her
and
shows
her
how
to
walk
nicely
over
the
fields
and
not
get
her
shoes
full
of
earth
and
what
that
why
if
you
have
a
blue
frock
on
today
come
let
me
see
ay
is
blue
so
it
is
and
a
belt
round
and
all
remember
when
you
came
on
the
big
ship
and
the
engines
did
you
see
them
that
right
and
now
run
home
to
the
boys
again
they
find
you
something
to
play
with
oline
is
gone
and
inger
has
taken
up
her
old
work
once
more
in
house
and
yard
she
overdoes
it
a
little
maybe
in
cleanliness
and
order
just
by
way
of
showing
that
she
was
going
to
have
things
differently
now
and
indeed
it
was
wonderful
to
see
what
a
change
was
made
even
the
glass
windows
in
the
old
turf
hut
were
cleaned
and
the
boxes
swept
out
but
it
was
only
the
first
days
the
first
week
after
that
she
began
to
be
less
eager
about
the
work
there
was
really
no
need
to
take
all
that
trouble
about
cowsheds
and
things
she
could
make
better
use
of
her
time
now
inger
had
learned
a
deal
among
the
town
folk
and
it
would
be
a
pity
not
to
turn
it
to
account
she
took
to
her
and
loom
again
true
enough
she
was
even
quicker
and
neater
than
before
a
trifle
too
quick
especially
when
isak
was
looking
on
he
could
make
out
how
any
one
could
learn
to
use
their
fingers
that
way
the
fine
long
fingers
she
had
to
her
big
hands
but
inger
had
a
way
of
dropping
one
piece
of
work
to
take
up
another
all
in
a
moment
well
well
there
were
more
things
to
be
looked
to
now
than
before
and
maybe
she
was
not
altogether
so
patient
as
she
had
been
a
trifle
of
unrest
had
managed
to
creep
in
first
of
all
there
were
the
flowers
she
had
brought
with
her
bulbs
and
cuttings
little
lives
these
too
that
must
be
thought
of
the
glass
window
was
too
small
the
ledge
too
narrow
to
set
on
and
besides
she
had
no
isak
must
make
some
tiny
boxes
for
begonias
fuchsias
and
roses
also
one
window
was
not
enough
fancy
a
room
with
only
one
window
and
oh
by
the
way
said
inger
i
want
an
iron
you
know
there
is
one
in
the
place
i
could
use
a
flat
iron
for
pressing
when
sewing
dresses
and
things
but
you
ca
do
proper
work
without
an
iron
of
some
sort
isak
promised
to
get
the
blacksmith
down
at
the
village
to
make
a
oh
isak
was
ready
to
do
anything
do
all
that
she
asked
in
every
way
for
he
could
see
well
enough
that
inger
had
learned
a
heap
of
things
now
and
matchless
clever
she
was
grown
she
spoke
too
in
a
different
way
a
little
finer
using
elegant
words
she
never
shouted
out
to
him
now
as
she
used
to
come
and
get
your
food
but
would
say
instead
dinner
ready
if
you
please
everything
was
different
now
in
the
old
days
he
would
answer
simply
ay
or
say
nothing
at
all
and
go
on
working
for
a
bit
before
he
came
now
he
said
thanks
and
went
in
at
once
love
makes
the
wise
a
fool
now
and
then
isak
would
say
thanks
thanks
ay
all
was
different
now
maybe
a
trifle
too
fine
in
some
ways
when
isak
spoke
of
dung
and
was
rough
in
his
speech
as
peasants
are
inger
would
call
it
manure
for
the
sake
of
the
children
you
know
she
was
careful
with
the
children
and
taught
them
everything
educated
them
let
tiny
leopoldine
go
on
quickly
with
her
crochet
work
and
the
boys
with
writing
and
schooling
they
would
not
be
altogether
behindhand
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
go
to
school
in
the
village
eleseus
in
particular
was
grown
a
clever
one
but
little
sivert
was
nothing
much
if
the
truth
must
be
told
a
madcap
a
jackanapes
he
even
ventured
to
screw
a
little
at
and
had
already
hacked
off
splinters
from
table
and
chairs
with
his
new
inger
had
threatened
to
take
it
away
altogether
the
children
of
course
had
all
the
animals
about
the
place
and
eleseus
had
still
his
coloured
pencil
besides
he
used
it
very
carefully
and
rarely
lent
it
to
his
brother
but
for
all
that
the
walls
were
covered
with
blue
and
red
drawings
as
time
went
on
and
the
pencil
got
smaller
and
smaller
at
last
eleseus
was
simply
forced
to
put
sivert
on
rations
with
it
lending
him
the
pencil
on
sunday
only
for
one
drawing
sivert
was
not
pleased
with
the
arrangement
but
eleseus
was
a
fellow
who
would
stand
no
nonsense
not
so
much
as
being
the
stronger
but
he
had
longer
arms
and
could
manage
better
when
it
came
to
a
quarrel
but
that
sivert
now
and
again
he
would
come
across
a
bird
nest
in
the
woods
once
he
talked
about
a
he
had
found
and
made
a
lot
of
that
another
time
it
was
a
great
fish
as
big
as
a
man
he
had
seen
in
the
river
but
it
was
all
evidently
his
own
invention
he
was
somewhat
inclined
to
make
black
into
white
was
sivert
but
a
good
sort
for
all
that
when
the
cat
had
kittens
it
was
he
who
brought
her
milk
because
she
hissed
too
much
for
eleseus
sivert
was
never
tired
of
standing
looking
at
the
box
full
of
movement
a
nest
of
tumbling
furry
paws
the
chickens
too
he
noticed
every
day
the
cock
with
his
lordly
carriage
and
fine
feathers
the
hens
tripping
about
chattering
low
and
pecking
at
the
sand
or
screaming
out
as
if
terribly
hurt
every
time
they
had
laid
an
egg
and
there
was
the
big
wether
little
sivert
had
read
a
good
deal
to
what
he
knew
before
but
he
could
not
say
of
the
wether
that
the
beast
had
a
fine
roman
nose
begad
that
he
could
not
say
but
he
could
do
better
than
that
he
knew
the
wether
from
the
day
when
it
had
been
a
lamb
he
understood
it
and
was
one
with
it
a
kinsman
a
once
a
strange
primitive
impression
flickered
through
his
senses
it
was
a
moment
he
never
forgot
the
wether
was
grazing
quietly
in
the
field
suddenly
it
threw
up
its
head
stopped
munching
simply
stood
there
looking
out
sivert
looked
involuntarily
in
the
same
direction
no
nothing
remarkable
but
sivert
himself
felt
something
strange
within
him
is
most
as
if
he
stood
looking
into
the
garden
of
eden
he
thought
there
were
the
cows
the
children
had
each
a
couple
great
sailing
creatures
so
friendly
and
tame
that
they
let
themselves
be
caught
whenever
you
liked
let
human
children
pat
them
there
was
the
pig
white
and
particular
about
its
person
when
decently
looked
after
listening
to
every
sound
a
comical
fellow
always
eager
for
food
and
ticklish
and
fidgety
as
a
girl
and
there
was
the
there
was
always
one
old
at
sellanraa
for
as
soon
as
one
died
another
was
ready
to
take
his
place
and
was
there
ever
anything
so
solemnly
ridiculous
to
look
at
just
now
he
had
a
whole
lot
of
goats
to
look
after
but
at
times
he
would
get
sick
and
tired
of
them
all
and
lie
down
a
bearded
thoughtful
spectacle
a
veritable
father
abraham
and
then
in
a
moment
up
again
and
off
after
the
flock
he
always
left
a
trail
of
sourish
air
behind
him
the
daily
round
of
the
farm
goes
on
now
and
again
a
traveller
comes
by
on
his
way
up
to
the
hills
and
asks
and
how
all
with
ye
here
and
isak
answers
ay
thank
ye
kindly
isak
works
and
works
consulting
the
almanac
for
all
that
he
does
notes
the
changes
of
the
moon
pays
heed
to
the
signs
of
the
weather
and
works
on
he
has
beaten
out
so
much
of
a
track
down
to
the
village
that
he
can
drive
in
now
with
horse
and
cart
but
for
the
most
part
he
carries
his
load
himself
carries
loads
of
cheese
or
hides
and
bark
and
resin
and
butter
and
eggs
all
things
he
can
sell
to
bring
back
other
wares
instead
no
in
the
summer
he
does
not
often
drive
down
for
one
thing
because
the
road
down
from
breidablik
the
last
part
of
the
way
is
so
badly
kept
he
has
asked
brede
olsen
to
help
with
the
upkeep
of
the
road
and
do
his
share
brede
olsen
promises
but
does
not
hold
to
his
word
and
isak
will
not
ask
him
again
rather
carry
a
load
on
his
back
himself
and
inger
says
i
ca
understand
how
you
ever
manage
it
all
oh
but
he
could
manage
anything
he
had
a
pair
of
boots
so
unimaginably
heavy
and
thick
with
great
slabs
of
iron
on
the
soles
even
the
straps
were
fastened
with
copper
nails
it
was
a
marvel
that
one
man
could
walk
in
such
boots
at
all
on
one
of
his
journeys
down
he
came
upon
several
gangs
of
men
at
work
on
the
moors
putting
down
stone
sockets
and
fixing
telegraph
poles
some
of
them
are
from
the
village
brede
olsen
is
there
too
for
all
that
he
has
taken
up
land
of
his
own
and
ought
to
be
working
on
that
isak
wonders
that
brede
can
find
time
the
foreman
asks
if
isak
can
sell
them
telegraph
poles
isak
says
no
not
if
he
well
paid
for
them
oh
isak
was
grown
a
thought
quicker
in
his
dealings
now
he
could
say
no
if
he
sold
them
a
few
poles
to
be
sure
it
would
be
money
in
his
pockets
so
many
more
but
he
had
no
timber
to
spare
there
was
nothing
gained
by
that
the
engineer
in
charge
comes
up
himself
to
ask
but
isak
refuses
we
poles
enough
says
the
engineer
but
it
would
be
easier
to
take
them
from
your
ground
up
there
and
save
transport
i
no
timber
to
spare
myself
says
isak
i
want
to
get
up
a
bit
of
a
saw
and
do
some
cutting
there
some
more
buildings
i
need
to
have
ready
soon
here
brede
olsen
put
in
a
word
and
says
if
i
was
you
isak
sell
them
poles
for
all
his
patience
isak
gave
brede
a
look
and
said
ay
i
dare
say
you
would
well
what
asks
brede
only
that
i
not
you
said
isak
some
of
the
workmen
chuckled
a
little
at
this
ay
isak
had
reason
enough
just
then
to
put
his
neighbour
down
that
very
day
he
had
seen
three
sheep
in
the
fields
at
breidablik
and
one
of
them
he
knew
the
one
with
the
flat
ears
that
oline
had
bartered
away
he
may
keep
it
thought
isak
as
he
went
on
his
way
brede
and
his
woman
may
get
all
the
sheep
they
want
for
me
that
business
of
the
saw
was
always
in
his
thoughts
it
was
as
he
had
said
last
winter
when
the
roads
were
hard
he
had
carted
up
the
big
circular
blade
and
the
fittings
ordered
from
trondhjem
through
the
village
store
the
parts
were
lying
in
one
of
the
sheds
now
well
smeared
with
oil
to
keep
off
the
rust
he
had
brought
up
some
of
the
beams
too
for
the
framework
he
could
begin
building
when
he
pleased
but
he
put
it
off
what
could
it
be
was
he
beginning
to
grow
slack
was
he
wearing
out
he
could
not
understand
it
himself
it
would
have
been
no
surprise
to
others
perhaps
but
isak
could
not
believe
it
was
his
head
going
he
had
never
been
afraid
of
taking
up
a
piece
of
work
before
he
must
have
changed
somehow
since
the
time
when
he
had
built
his
mill
across
a
river
just
as
big
he
could
get
in
help
from
the
village
but
he
would
try
again
alone
he
would
start
in
a
day
or
so
and
inger
could
lend
him
a
hand
he
spoke
to
inger
about
it
hm
i
do
know
if
you
could
find
time
one
of
these
days
to
lend
a
hand
with
that
sawmill
inger
thought
for
a
moment
ye
s
if
i
can
manage
it
so
going
to
set
up
a
sawmill
ay
is
my
intention
so
i
worked
it
all
out
in
my
head
will
that
be
harder
than
the
mill
was
much
harder
ten
times
as
hard
why
it
all
got
to
be
as
close
and
exact
down
to
the
tiniest
line
and
the
saw
itself
exactly
midways
if
only
you
can
manage
it
said
inger
thoughtlessly
isak
was
offended
and
answered
as
to
that
we
shall
see
could
you
get
a
man
to
help
you
some
one
that
knows
the
work
no
well
then
you
wo
be
able
to
manage
it
said
she
again
isak
put
up
his
hand
to
his
hair
it
was
like
a
bear
lifting
his
paw
was
just
that
i
been
fearing
said
he
that
i
might
not
manage
it
and
that
why
i
wanted
you
that
learned
so
much
to
help
me
that
was
one
to
the
bear
but
nothing
gained
after
all
inger
tossed
her
head
and
turned
aside
unkindly
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
saw
well
then
said
isak
why
do
you
want
me
to
stand
getting
drenched
in
the
river
and
have
me
laid
up
and
who
to
do
all
the
sewing
and
look
to
the
animals
and
keep
house
and
all
the
rest
no
that
true
said
isak
oh
but
it
was
only
the
four
corner
posts
and
the
middle
ones
for
the
two
long
sides
he
wanted
help
with
that
was
all
inger
was
she
really
grown
so
different
in
her
heart
through
living
among
folk
from
the
towns
the
fact
was
that
inger
had
changed
a
good
deal
she
thought
now
less
of
their
common
good
than
of
herself
she
had
taken
loom
and
wheel
into
use
again
but
the
sewing
machine
was
more
to
her
taste
and
when
the
came
up
from
the
blacksmith
she
was
ready
to
set
up
as
a
dressmaker
she
had
a
profession
now
she
began
by
making
a
couple
of
little
frocks
for
leopoldine
isak
thought
them
pretty
and
praised
them
maybe
a
thought
too
much
inger
hinted
that
it
was
nothing
to
what
she
could
do
when
she
tried
but
they
too
short
said
isak
they
worn
that
way
in
town
said
inger
you
know
nothing
about
it
isak
saw
he
had
gone
too
far
and
to
make
up
for
it
said
something
about
getting
some
material
for
inger
herself
for
something
or
other
for
a
cloak
said
inger
ay
or
what
you
like
inger
agreed
to
have
something
for
a
cloak
and
described
the
sort
of
stuff
she
wanted
but
when
she
had
made
the
cloak
she
had
to
find
some
one
to
show
it
to
accordingly
when
the
boys
went
down
to
the
village
to
be
put
to
school
inger
herself
went
with
them
and
that
journey
might
have
seemed
a
little
thing
but
it
left
its
mark
they
came
first
of
all
to
breidablik
and
the
breidablik
woman
and
her
children
came
out
to
see
who
it
was
going
by
there
sat
inger
and
the
two
boys
driving
down
the
boys
on
their
way
to
school
nothing
less
and
inger
wearing
a
cloak
the
breidablik
woman
felt
a
sting
at
the
sight
the
cloak
she
could
have
done
without
thank
heaven
set
no
store
by
such
foolishness
but
she
had
children
of
her
own
barbro
a
great
girl
already
helge
the
next
and
kathrine
all
of
an
age
for
school
the
two
eldest
had
been
to
school
before
when
they
lived
down
in
the
village
but
after
moving
up
to
breidablik
to
an
place
up
on
the
moors
they
had
been
forced
to
give
it
up
and
let
the
children
run
heathen
again
you
be
wanting
a
bite
for
the
boys
maybe
said
the
woman
food
do
you
see
this
chest
here
it
my
travelling
trunk
that
i
brought
home
with
me
i
that
full
of
food
and
what
be
in
it
of
sorts
what
sorts
i
meat
and
pork
in
plenty
and
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
besides
ay
you
no
lack
up
at
sellanraa
said
the
other
and
her
poor
children
listened
with
eyes
and
ears
to
this
talk
of
rich
things
to
eat
and
where
will
they
be
staying
asked
the
mother
at
the
blacksmith
said
inger
ho
said
the
other
ay
mine
be
going
to
school
again
soon
they
stay
with
the
lensmand
ho
said
inger
ay
or
at
the
doctor
maybe
or
at
the
parsonage
brede
he
in
with
the
great
folks
there
of
course
inger
fumbled
with
her
cloak
and
managed
to
turn
it
so
that
a
bit
of
black
silk
fringe
appeared
to
advantage
where
did
you
get
the
cloak
asked
the
woman
one
you
had
with
you
maybe
i
made
it
myself
ay
ay
is
as
i
said
wealth
and
riches
full
and
running
over
inger
drove
on
feeling
all
set
up
and
pleased
with
herself
and
coming
into
the
village
she
may
have
been
a
trifle
overproud
in
her
bearing
lensmand
heyerdahl
lady
was
not
pleased
at
the
sight
of
that
cloak
the
sellanraa
woman
was
forgetting
her
place
forgetting
where
it
was
she
had
come
from
after
five
years
absence
but
inger
had
at
least
a
chance
of
showing
off
her
cloak
and
the
wife
and
the
blacksmith
wife
and
the
schoolmaster
wife
all
thought
of
getting
one
like
it
for
themselves
but
it
could
wait
a
bit
and
now
it
was
not
long
before
inger
began
to
have
visitors
one
or
two
women
came
across
from
the
other
side
of
the
hills
out
of
curiosity
oline
had
perhaps
chanced
to
say
something
against
her
will
to
this
one
or
that
those
who
came
now
brought
news
from
inger
own
birthplace
what
more
natural
than
that
inger
should
give
them
a
cup
of
coffee
and
let
them
look
at
her
young
girls
came
up
in
pairs
from
the
coast
from
the
village
to
ask
inger
advice
it
was
autumn
now
and
they
had
been
saving
up
for
a
new
dress
and
wanted
her
to
help
them
inger
of
course
would
know
all
about
the
latest
fashions
after
being
out
in
the
world
and
now
and
again
she
would
do
a
little
cutting
out
inger
herself
brightened
up
at
these
visits
and
was
glad
kindly
and
helpful
she
was
too
and
clever
at
the
work
besides
she
could
cut
out
material
without
a
pattern
sometimes
she
would
even
hem
a
whole
length
on
her
machine
and
all
for
nothing
and
give
the
stuff
back
to
the
girls
with
a
delightful
jest
there
now
you
can
sew
the
buttons
on
yourself
later
in
the
year
inger
was
sent
for
down
to
the
village
to
do
dressmaking
for
some
of
the
great
folks
there
inger
could
not
go
she
had
a
household
to
look
after
and
animals
besides
all
the
work
of
the
home
and
she
had
no
servant
had
no
what
servant
she
spoke
to
isak
one
day
if
only
i
had
some
one
to
help
me
i
could
put
in
more
time
sewing
isak
did
not
understand
help
yes
help
in
the
house
a
isak
must
have
been
taken
aback
at
this
he
laughed
a
little
in
his
iron
beard
and
took
it
as
a
jest
ay
we
should
have
a
said
he
housewives
in
the
towns
always
have
a
servant
said
inger
ho
said
isak
well
isak
was
not
perhaps
in
the
best
of
humour
just
then
not
exactly
gentle
and
content
no
for
he
had
started
work
on
that
sawmill
and
it
was
a
slow
and
toilsome
business
he
could
hold
the
baulks
with
one
hand
and
a
level
in
the
other
and
fix
ends
at
the
same
time
but
when
the
boys
came
back
from
school
again
it
was
easier
the
lads
were
useful
and
a
help
bless
them
sivert
especially
had
a
genius
for
knocking
in
nails
but
eleseus
was
better
at
handling
a
by
the
end
of
a
week
isak
and
the
boys
had
actually
got
the
foundation
posts
in
and
soundly
fixed
with
stretcher
pieces
as
thick
as
the
beams
themselves
it
worked
out
all
right
everything
worked
out
all
right
somehow
but
isak
was
beginning
to
feel
tired
in
the
evenings
now
whatever
it
could
be
it
was
not
only
building
a
sawmill
and
getting
that
done
there
was
everything
else
besides
the
hay
was
in
but
the
corn
was
standing
yet
soon
it
would
have
to
be
cut
and
stacked
there
were
the
potatoes
too
they
would
have
to
be
taken
up
before
long
but
the
boys
were
a
wonderful
help
he
did
not
thank
them
was
not
the
way
among
folk
of
their
sort
but
he
was
mightily
pleased
with
them
for
all
that
now
and
again
they
would
sit
down
in
the
middle
of
their
work
and
talk
together
the
father
almost
asking
his
sons
advice
as
to
what
they
should
do
next
those
were
proud
moments
for
the
lads
they
learned
also
to
think
well
before
they
spoke
lest
they
should
be
in
the
wrong
be
a
pity
not
to
have
the
saw
roofed
in
before
the
autumn
rains
said
their
father
if
only
inger
had
been
as
in
the
old
days
but
inger
was
not
so
strong
as
she
had
been
it
seemed
and
that
was
natural
enough
after
her
long
spell
within
walls
that
her
mind
too
seemed
changed
was
another
matter
strange
how
little
thought
how
little
care
she
seemed
to
take
now
shallow
and
heedless
was
this
inger
one
day
she
spoke
of
the
child
she
had
killed
and
a
fool
i
was
to
do
it
she
said
we
might
have
had
her
mouth
sewed
up
too
and
then
i
need
have
throttled
her
and
she
never
stole
off
now
to
a
tiny
grave
in
the
forest
where
once
she
had
patted
the
earth
with
her
hands
and
set
up
a
little
cross
but
inger
was
not
altogether
heartless
yet
she
cared
for
her
other
children
kept
them
clean
and
made
new
clothes
for
them
she
would
sit
up
late
at
night
mending
their
things
it
was
her
ambition
to
see
them
get
on
in
the
world
the
corn
was
stacked
and
the
potatoes
were
taken
up
then
came
the
winter
no
the
sawmill
did
not
get
roofed
in
that
autumn
but
that
could
not
be
helped
after
all
was
not
a
matter
of
life
or
death
next
summer
would
be
time
and
means
enough
chapter
xiii
the
winter
round
of
work
was
as
before
carting
wood
mending
tools
and
implements
inger
kept
house
and
did
sewing
in
her
spare
time
the
boys
were
down
in
the
village
again
for
the
long
term
at
school
for
several
winters
past
they
had
had
a
pair
of
between
them
they
managed
well
enough
that
way
as
long
as
they
were
at
home
one
waiting
while
the
other
took
his
turn
or
one
standing
on
behind
the
other
ay
they
managed
finely
with
but
one
pair
it
was
the
finest
thing
they
knew
and
they
were
innocent
and
glad
but
down
in
the
village
things
were
different
the
school
was
full
of
even
the
children
at
breidablik
it
seemed
had
each
a
pair
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
isak
had
to
make
a
new
pair
for
eleseus
sivert
keeping
the
old
pair
for
his
own
isak
did
more
he
had
the
boys
well
clad
and
gave
them
everlasting
boots
but
when
that
was
done
isak
went
to
the
storekeeper
and
asked
for
a
ring
a
ring
said
the
man
a
finger
ring
ay
i
grown
that
high
and
mighty
now
i
must
give
my
wife
a
ring
do
you
want
a
silver
one
or
gold
or
just
a
brass
ring
dipped
to
look
like
gold
let
say
a
silver
ring
the
storekeeper
thought
for
a
while
look
you
isak
he
said
if
you
want
to
do
the
proper
thing
and
give
your
wife
a
ring
she
need
be
ashamed
to
wear
you
better
make
it
a
gold
ring
what
said
isak
aloud
though
maybe
in
his
inmost
heart
he
had
been
thinking
of
a
gold
ring
all
the
time
they
talked
the
matter
over
seriously
and
agreed
about
getting
a
measurement
of
some
sort
for
the
ring
isak
was
thoughtful
and
shook
his
head
and
reckoned
it
was
a
big
thing
to
do
but
the
storekeeper
refused
to
order
anything
but
a
gold
ring
isak
went
home
again
secretly
pleased
with
his
decision
but
somewhat
anxious
for
all
that
at
the
extravagant
lengths
he
had
gone
to
all
for
being
in
love
with
his
wife
there
was
a
good
average
snowfall
that
winter
and
early
in
the
year
when
the
roads
were
passable
folk
from
the
village
began
carting
up
telegraph
poles
over
the
moors
dropping
their
loads
at
regular
intervals
they
drove
big
teams
and
came
up
past
breidablik
past
sellanraa
farm
and
met
new
teams
beyond
coming
down
with
poles
from
the
other
side
of
the
hills
the
line
was
complete
so
life
went
on
day
by
day
without
any
great
event
what
was
there
to
happen
anyway
spring
came
and
the
work
of
setting
up
the
poles
began
brede
olsen
was
there
again
with
the
gangs
though
he
should
have
been
working
on
his
own
land
at
that
season
is
a
wonder
the
time
thought
isak
isak
himself
had
barely
time
to
eat
and
sleep
it
was
a
close
thing
to
get
through
the
season
work
now
with
all
the
land
he
had
brought
under
tillage
then
between
seasons
he
got
his
sawmill
roofed
in
and
could
set
to
work
putting
up
the
machine
parts
and
look
you
was
no
marvel
of
fine
woodwork
he
had
set
up
but
strong
it
was
as
a
giant
of
the
hills
and
stood
there
to
good
use
the
saw
could
work
and
cut
as
a
sawmill
should
isak
had
kept
his
eyes
about
him
down
in
the
village
and
used
them
well
it
was
hearty
and
small
this
sawmill
he
had
built
but
he
was
pleased
with
it
he
carved
the
date
above
the
doorway
and
put
his
mark
and
that
summer
something
more
than
usual
did
come
about
after
all
at
sellanraa
the
telegraph
workers
had
now
reached
so
far
up
over
the
moors
that
the
foremost
gang
came
to
the
farm
one
evening
and
asked
to
be
lodged
for
the
night
they
were
given
shelter
in
the
big
barn
as
the
days
went
on
the
other
gangs
came
along
and
all
were
housed
at
sellanraa
the
work
went
on
ahead
passing
the
farm
but
the
men
still
came
back
to
sleep
in
the
barn
one
saturday
evening
came
the
engineer
in
charge
to
pay
the
men
at
sight
of
the
engineer
eleseus
felt
his
heart
jump
and
stole
out
of
the
house
lest
he
should
be
asked
about
that
coloured
pencil
oh
there
would
be
trouble
now
and
sivert
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
would
have
to
face
it
alone
eleseus
slipped
round
the
corner
of
the
house
like
a
pale
ghost
found
his
mother
and
begged
her
to
tell
sivert
to
come
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
sivert
took
the
matter
less
to
heart
but
then
he
was
not
the
chief
culprit
the
two
brothers
went
a
little
way
off
and
sat
down
and
eleseus
said
if
you
say
it
was
you
now
me
said
sivert
you
younger
he
would
do
anything
to
you
sivert
thought
over
it
and
saw
that
his
brother
was
in
distress
also
it
flattered
him
to
feel
that
the
other
needed
his
help
why
i
might
help
you
out
of
it
perhaps
said
he
in
a
voice
ay
if
you
would
said
eleseus
and
quite
simply
gave
his
brother
the
bit
of
pencil
that
was
left
you
can
have
it
for
keeps
he
said
they
were
going
in
again
together
but
eleseus
recollected
he
had
something
he
must
do
over
at
the
sawmill
or
rather
at
the
cornmill
something
he
must
look
to
and
it
would
take
some
time
he
would
be
finished
just
yet
sivert
went
in
alone
there
sat
the
engineer
paying
out
notes
and
silver
and
when
he
had
finished
inger
gave
him
milk
to
drink
a
jug
and
a
glass
and
he
thanked
her
then
he
talked
to
little
leopoldine
and
then
noticing
the
drawings
on
the
walls
asked
straight
out
who
had
done
that
was
it
you
he
asked
turning
to
sivert
the
man
felt
perhaps
he
owed
something
for
inger
hospitality
and
praised
the
drawings
just
to
please
her
inger
on
her
part
explained
the
matter
as
it
was
it
was
her
boys
had
made
the
drawings
both
of
them
they
had
no
paper
till
she
came
home
and
looked
to
things
so
they
had
marked
all
about
the
walls
but
she
had
the
heart
to
wash
it
off
again
why
leave
it
as
it
is
said
the
engineer
paper
did
you
say
and
he
took
out
a
heap
of
big
sheets
there
draw
away
on
that
till
i
come
round
again
and
how
are
you
off
for
pencils
sivert
stepped
forward
simply
with
the
stump
he
had
and
showed
how
small
it
was
and
behold
the
man
gave
him
a
new
coloured
pencil
not
even
sharpened
there
now
you
can
start
afresh
but
i
make
the
horses
red
if
i
were
you
and
do
the
goats
with
blue
never
seen
a
blue
horse
have
you
and
the
engineer
went
on
his
way
that
same
evening
a
man
came
up
from
the
village
with
a
basket
he
handed
out
some
bottles
to
the
workmen
and
went
off
again
but
after
he
had
gone
it
was
no
longer
so
quiet
about
the
place
some
one
played
an
accordion
the
men
talked
loudly
and
there
was
singing
and
even
dancing
at
sellanraa
one
of
the
men
asked
inger
out
to
dance
and
inger
who
would
have
thought
it
of
her
she
laughed
a
little
laugh
and
actually
danced
a
few
turns
round
after
that
some
of
the
others
asked
her
and
she
danced
not
a
little
in
the
end
inger
who
could
say
what
was
in
her
mind
here
she
was
dancing
gaily
maybe
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
sought
after
riotously
pursued
by
thirty
men
and
she
alone
the
only
one
to
choose
from
no
one
to
cut
her
out
and
those
burly
telegraph
men
how
they
lifted
her
why
not
dance
eleseus
and
sivert
were
fast
asleep
in
the
little
chamber
undisturbed
by
all
the
noise
outside
little
leopoldine
was
up
looking
on
wonderingly
at
her
mother
as
she
danced
isak
was
out
in
the
fields
all
the
time
he
had
gone
off
directly
after
supper
and
when
he
came
home
to
go
to
bed
some
one
offered
him
a
bottle
he
drank
a
little
and
sat
watching
the
dancing
with
leopoldine
on
his
lap
is
a
gay
time
you
having
said
he
kindly
to
inger
footing
it
properly
tonight
after
a
while
the
music
stopped
and
the
dance
was
over
the
workmen
got
ready
to
leave
they
were
going
down
to
the
village
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
and
would
be
there
all
next
day
coming
back
on
monday
morning
soon
all
was
quiet
again
at
sellanraa
a
couple
of
the
older
men
stayed
behind
and
turned
in
to
sleep
in
the
barn
isak
woke
up
in
the
night
inger
was
not
there
could
she
be
gone
to
see
to
the
cows
he
got
up
and
went
across
to
the
cowshed
inger
he
called
no
answer
the
cows
turned
their
heads
and
looked
at
him
all
was
still
unthinkingly
from
ancient
habit
he
counted
heads
counted
the
sheep
also
there
was
one
of
the
ewes
had
a
bad
habit
of
staying
out
at
night
and
out
it
was
now
inger
he
called
again
still
no
answer
surely
she
could
have
gone
with
them
down
to
the
village
the
summer
night
was
light
and
warm
isak
stayed
a
while
sitting
on
the
then
he
went
out
into
the
woods
to
look
for
the
ewe
and
he
found
inger
inger
and
one
other
they
sat
in
the
heather
she
twirling
his
peaked
cap
on
one
finger
both
talking
together
they
were
after
her
again
it
seemed
isak
trundled
slowly
over
towards
them
inger
turned
and
saw
him
and
bowed
forward
where
she
sat
all
the
life
went
out
of
her
she
hung
like
a
rag
h
did
you
know
that
ewe
out
again
asked
isak
but
no
you
would
know
said
he
the
young
telegraph
hand
picked
up
his
cap
and
began
sidling
away
i
be
getting
along
after
the
others
he
said
to
ye
no
one
answered
so
you
sitting
here
said
isak
going
to
stay
out
a
bit
maybe
and
he
turned
towards
home
inger
rose
to
her
knees
got
on
her
feet
and
followed
after
and
so
they
went
man
in
front
and
wife
behind
they
went
home
inger
must
have
found
time
to
think
oh
she
found
a
way
was
the
ewe
i
was
after
said
she
i
saw
it
was
out
again
then
one
of
the
men
came
up
and
helped
me
look
we
not
been
sitting
a
moment
when
you
came
where
are
you
going
now
i
seems
i
better
look
for
the
creature
myself
no
no
go
and
lie
down
if
any
one
to
go
let
me
go
and
lie
down
you
be
needing
rest
and
as
for
that
the
ewe
can
stay
out
where
she
is
be
the
first
time
and
be
eaten
up
by
some
beast
or
other
said
isak
and
went
off
inger
ran
after
him
do
do
it
not
worth
it
she
said
you
need
rest
let
me
go
isak
gave
in
but
he
would
not
hear
of
inger
going
out
to
search
by
herself
and
they
went
indoors
together
inger
turned
at
once
to
look
for
the
children
went
into
the
little
chamber
to
see
to
the
boys
as
if
she
had
been
out
on
some
perfectly
natural
errand
it
almost
seemed
indeed
as
if
she
were
trying
to
make
up
to
isak
as
if
she
expected
him
to
be
more
in
love
with
her
than
ever
that
evening
after
she
had
explained
it
all
so
neatly
but
no
isak
was
not
so
easy
to
turn
he
would
rather
have
seen
her
thoroughly
distressed
and
beside
herself
with
contrition
ay
that
would
have
been
better
what
matter
that
she
had
collapsed
for
a
moment
when
he
came
on
her
in
the
woods
the
little
moment
of
shame
what
was
the
good
of
that
when
it
all
passed
off
so
soon
he
was
far
from
gentle
too
the
next
day
and
that
a
sunday
went
off
and
looked
to
the
sawmill
looked
to
the
cornmill
looked
over
the
fields
with
the
children
or
by
himself
inger
tried
once
to
join
him
but
isak
turned
away
i
going
up
to
the
river
he
said
something
up
there
there
was
trouble
in
his
mind
like
enough
but
he
bore
it
silently
and
made
no
scene
oh
there
was
something
great
about
isak
as
it
might
be
israel
promised
and
ever
deceived
but
still
believing
by
monday
the
tension
was
less
marked
and
as
the
days
went
on
the
impression
of
that
unhappy
saturday
evening
grew
fainter
time
can
mend
a
deal
of
things
a
spit
and
a
shake
a
meal
and
a
good
rest
and
it
will
heal
the
sorriest
of
wounds
isak
trouble
was
not
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
after
all
he
was
not
certain
that
he
had
been
wronged
and
apart
from
that
he
had
other
things
to
think
of
the
harvesting
was
at
hand
and
last
not
least
the
telegraph
line
was
all
but
finished
now
in
a
little
while
they
would
be
left
in
peace
a
broad
light
road
a
king
highway
had
been
cut
through
the
dark
of
the
forest
there
were
poles
and
wires
running
right
up
over
the
hills
next
saturday
paytime
the
last
there
was
to
be
isak
managed
to
be
away
from
home
he
wished
it
so
he
went
down
into
the
village
with
cheese
and
butter
and
came
back
on
sunday
night
the
men
were
all
gone
from
the
barn
nearly
all
that
is
the
last
man
stumbled
out
of
the
yard
with
his
pack
on
his
shoulder
all
but
the
last
that
is
that
it
was
not
altogether
safe
as
yet
isak
could
see
for
there
was
a
bundle
left
on
the
floor
of
the
barn
where
the
owner
was
he
could
not
say
and
did
not
care
to
know
but
there
was
a
peaked
cap
on
top
of
the
bundle
an
offence
to
the
eye
isak
heaved
the
bundle
out
into
the
yard
flung
the
cap
out
after
it
and
closed
the
door
then
he
went
into
the
stable
and
looked
out
through
the
window
and
thought
belike
let
the
bundle
stay
there
and
let
the
cap
lie
there
is
all
one
whose
they
may
be
a
bit
of
dirt
he
is
and
not
worth
my
while
so
he
might
have
thought
but
when
the
fellow
comes
for
his
bundle
never
doubt
but
that
isak
will
be
there
to
take
him
by
the
arm
and
make
that
arm
a
trifle
blue
and
as
for
kicking
him
off
the
place
in
a
way
he
remember
why
isak
would
give
him
that
too
whereupon
isak
left
his
window
in
the
stable
and
went
back
to
the
cowshed
and
looked
out
from
there
and
could
not
rest
the
bundle
was
tied
up
with
string
the
poor
fellow
had
no
lock
to
his
bag
and
the
string
had
come
undone
isak
could
not
feel
sure
he
had
not
dealt
over
hardly
with
that
bundle
whatever
it
might
be
he
was
not
sure
he
had
acted
rightly
only
just
now
he
had
been
in
the
village
and
seen
his
new
harrow
a
harrow
he
had
ordered
oh
a
wonderful
machine
an
idol
to
worship
and
it
had
just
come
a
thing
like
that
must
carry
a
blessing
with
it
and
the
powers
above
that
guide
the
footsteps
of
men
might
be
watching
him
now
at
this
moment
to
see
if
he
deserved
a
blessing
or
not
isak
gave
much
thought
to
the
powers
above
ay
he
had
seen
god
with
his
own
eyes
one
night
in
in
the
woods
it
was
rather
a
curious
sight
isak
went
out
into
the
yard
and
stood
over
the
bundle
he
was
still
in
doubt
he
thrust
his
hat
back
and
scratched
his
head
which
gave
him
a
appearance
for
the
moment
something
lordly
and
careless
as
it
might
have
been
a
spaniard
but
then
he
must
have
thought
something
like
this
nay
here
am
i
and
far
from
being
in
any
way
splendid
or
excellent
a
very
dog
and
then
he
tied
up
the
bundle
neatly
once
more
picked
up
the
cap
and
carried
all
back
into
the
barn
again
and
that
was
done
as
he
went
out
from
the
barn
and
over
to
the
mill
away
from
the
yard
away
from
everything
there
was
no
inger
to
be
seen
in
the
window
of
the
house
nay
then
let
her
be
where
she
pleased
no
doubt
she
was
in
bed
where
else
should
she
be
but
in
the
old
days
in
those
first
innocent
years
inger
could
never
rest
but
sat
up
at
nights
waiting
for
him
when
he
had
been
down
to
the
village
it
was
different
now
different
in
every
way
as
for
instance
when
he
had
given
her
that
ring
could
anything
have
been
more
utterly
a
failure
isak
had
been
gloriously
modest
and
far
from
venturing
to
call
it
a
gold
ring
is
nothing
grand
but
you
might
put
it
on
your
finger
just
to
try
is
it
gold
she
asked
ay
but
is
none
so
thick
said
he
and
here
she
was
to
have
answered
ay
but
indeed
it
is
but
instead
she
had
said
no
is
not
very
thick
but
still
nay
is
worth
no
more
than
a
bit
of
grass
belike
said
he
at
last
and
gave
up
hope
but
inger
had
indeed
been
glad
of
the
ring
and
wore
it
on
her
right
hand
looking
fine
there
when
she
was
sewing
now
and
again
she
would
let
the
village
girls
try
it
on
and
sit
with
it
on
their
finger
for
a
bit
when
they
came
up
to
ask
of
this
or
that
foolish
isak
not
to
understand
that
she
was
proud
of
it
beyond
measure
it
was
a
profitless
business
sitting
there
alone
in
the
mill
listening
to
the
fall
the
whole
night
through
isak
had
done
no
wrong
he
had
no
cause
to
hide
himself
away
he
left
the
mill
went
up
over
the
fields
and
home
into
the
house
and
then
in
truth
it
was
a
shamefaced
isak
shamefaced
and
glad
brede
olsen
sat
there
his
neighbour
and
no
other
sat
there
drinking
coffee
ay
inger
was
up
the
two
of
them
sat
there
simply
and
quietly
talking
and
drinking
coffee
here
isak
said
inger
pleasantly
as
could
be
and
got
up
and
poured
out
a
cup
for
him
evening
said
brede
and
was
just
as
pleasant
too
isak
could
see
that
brede
had
been
spending
the
evening
with
the
telegraph
gangs
the
last
night
before
they
went
he
was
somewhat
the
worse
for
it
maybe
but
friendly
and
enough
he
boasted
a
little
as
was
his
way
had
the
time
really
to
bother
with
this
telegraphic
work
the
farm
took
all
of
a
man
day
but
he
very
well
say
no
when
the
engineer
was
so
anxious
to
have
him
and
so
it
had
come
about
too
that
brede
had
had
to
take
over
the
job
of
line
inspector
not
for
the
sake
of
the
money
of
course
he
could
earn
many
times
that
down
in
the
village
but
he
had
liked
to
refuse
and
they
given
him
a
neat
little
machine
set
up
on
the
wall
a
curious
little
thing
a
sort
of
telegraph
in
itself
ay
brede
was
a
wastrel
and
a
boaster
but
for
all
that
isak
could
bear
him
no
grudge
he
himself
was
too
relieved
at
finding
his
neighbour
in
the
house
that
evening
instead
of
a
stranger
isak
had
the
peasant
coolness
of
mind
his
few
feelings
stability
stubbornness
he
chatted
with
brede
and
nodded
at
his
shallowness
another
cup
for
brede
said
he
and
inger
poured
it
out
inger
talked
of
the
engineer
a
kindly
man
he
was
beyond
measure
had
looked
at
the
boys
drawings
and
writings
and
even
said
something
about
taking
eleseus
to
work
under
him
to
work
with
him
said
isak
ay
to
the
town
to
do
writing
and
things
be
a
clerk
in
the
office
all
for
he
was
so
pleased
with
the
boy
writing
and
drawing
ho
said
isak
well
and
what
do
you
say
he
was
going
to
have
him
confirmed
too
that
was
a
great
thing
to
my
mind
ay
a
great
thing
indeed
said
brede
and
when
the
engineer
says
he
do
a
thing
he
do
it
i
know
him
and
you
can
take
my
word
for
that
we
no
eleseus
to
spare
on
this
farm
as
i
know
of
said
isak
there
was
something
like
a
painful
silence
after
that
isak
was
not
an
easy
man
to
talk
to
but
when
the
boy
himself
wants
to
get
on
said
inger
at
last
and
has
it
in
him
too
silence
again
then
said
brede
with
a
laugh
i
wish
he
ask
for
one
of
mine
anyway
i
enough
of
them
and
to
spare
but
barbro
the
eldest
and
she
a
girl
and
a
good
girl
enough
said
inger
for
politeness
sake
ay
i
not
say
no
said
brede
barbro
well
enough
and
clever
at
this
and
that
she
going
to
help
at
the
lensmand
now
going
to
the
lensmand
well
i
had
to
let
her
go
his
wife
was
so
set
on
it
i
could
say
no
it
was
well
on
towards
morning
now
and
brede
rose
to
go
i
a
bundle
and
a
cap
i
left
in
your
barn
he
said
that
is
if
the
men
have
run
off
with
it
he
added
jestingly
chapter
xiv
and
time
went
on
yes
eleseus
was
sent
to
town
after
all
inger
managed
that
he
was
there
for
a
year
then
he
was
confirmed
and
after
that
had
a
regular
place
in
the
engineer
office
and
grew
more
and
more
clever
at
writing
and
things
to
see
the
letters
he
sent
home
sometimes
with
red
and
black
ink
like
pictures
almost
and
the
talk
of
them
the
words
he
used
now
and
again
he
asked
for
money
something
towards
his
expenses
a
watch
and
chain
for
instance
he
must
have
so
as
not
to
oversleep
himself
in
the
morning
and
be
late
at
the
office
money
for
a
pipe
and
tobacco
also
such
as
the
other
young
clerks
in
the
town
always
had
and
for
something
he
called
and
something
he
called
evening
classes
where
he
learned
drawing
and
gymnastics
and
other
matters
proper
to
his
rank
and
position
altogether
it
was
no
light
matter
to
keep
eleseus
going
in
a
berth
in
town
said
isak
is
that
money
to
keep
in
your
pocket
maybe
that
must
be
it
no
doubt
said
inger
so
as
not
to
be
altogether
without
and
it
not
much
only
a
now
and
then
ay
that
just
it
said
isak
harshly
a
now
and
a
then
but
his
harshness
was
all
because
he
missed
eleseus
himself
and
wanted
him
home
it
makes
too
many
in
the
long
run
said
he
i
ca
keep
on
like
this
you
must
write
and
tell
him
he
can
have
no
more
ho
very
well
then
said
inger
in
an
offended
tone
there
sivert
what
does
he
get
by
way
of
inger
answered
you
never
been
in
a
town
and
so
you
do
know
these
things
sivert
no
need
of
and
talking
of
money
sivert
ought
to
be
none
so
badly
off
when
his
uncle
sivert
dies
you
do
know
ay
but
i
do
know
and
this
was
right
enough
in
a
way
uncle
sivert
had
said
something
about
making
little
sivert
his
heir
uncle
sivert
had
heard
of
eleseus
and
his
grand
doings
in
town
and
the
story
did
not
please
him
he
nodded
and
bit
his
lips
and
muttered
that
a
nephew
called
up
as
his
namesake
named
after
uncle
sivert
should
not
come
to
want
but
what
was
this
fortune
uncle
sivert
was
supposed
to
possess
had
he
really
besides
his
neglected
farm
and
his
fishery
the
heap
of
money
and
means
folk
generally
thought
no
one
could
say
for
certain
and
apart
from
that
uncle
sivert
himself
was
an
obstinate
man
he
insisted
that
little
sivert
should
come
to
stay
with
him
it
was
a
point
of
honour
with
him
this
last
he
should
take
little
sivert
and
look
after
him
as
the
engineer
had
done
with
eleseus
but
how
could
it
be
done
send
little
sivert
away
from
home
it
was
out
of
the
question
he
was
all
the
help
left
to
isak
now
moreover
the
lad
himself
had
no
great
wish
to
go
and
stay
with
his
famous
uncle
he
had
tried
it
once
but
had
come
home
again
he
was
confirmed
shot
up
in
stature
and
grew
the
down
showed
on
his
cheek
his
hands
were
big
a
pair
of
willing
slaves
and
he
worked
like
a
man
isak
could
hardly
have
managed
to
get
the
new
barn
built
at
all
without
sivert
help
but
there
it
stood
now
with
and
and
all
as
big
as
they
had
at
the
parsonage
itself
true
it
was
only
a
building
covered
with
boarding
but
extra
stout
built
with
iron
clinches
at
the
corners
and
covered
with
plank
from
isak
own
sawmill
and
sivert
had
hammered
in
more
than
one
nail
at
the
work
and
lifted
the
heavy
beams
for
the
framework
till
he
was
near
fainting
sivert
got
on
well
with
his
father
and
worked
steadily
at
his
side
he
was
made
of
the
same
stuff
and
yet
he
was
not
above
such
simple
ways
as
going
up
the
hillside
for
tansy
to
rub
with
so
as
to
smell
nice
in
church
was
leopoldine
was
the
one
for
getting
fancies
in
her
head
which
was
natural
enough
she
being
a
girl
and
the
only
daughter
that
summer
if
you
please
she
had
discovered
that
she
could
not
eat
her
porridge
at
supper
without
treacle
simply
could
and
she
was
no
great
use
at
any
kind
of
work
either
inger
had
not
yet
given
up
her
idea
of
keeping
a
servant
she
brought
up
the
question
every
spring
and
every
time
isak
opposed
it
stubbornly
all
the
cutting
out
and
sewing
and
fine
weaving
she
could
do
not
to
speak
of
making
embroidered
slippers
if
she
had
but
the
time
to
herself
and
of
late
isak
had
been
something
less
firm
in
his
refusal
though
he
grumbled
still
ho
the
first
time
he
had
made
a
whole
long
speech
about
it
not
as
a
matter
of
right
and
reason
nor
yet
from
pride
but
alas
from
weakness
from
anger
at
the
idea
but
now
he
seemed
to
be
giving
way
as
if
ashamed
if
ever
i
to
have
help
in
the
house
now
the
time
said
inger
a
few
years
more
and
leopoldine
be
big
enough
to
do
this
and
that
help
said
isak
what
do
you
want
help
with
anyway
want
with
it
indeed
have
you
help
yourself
have
you
sivert
all
the
time
what
could
isak
say
to
a
meaningless
argument
like
that
he
answered
ay
well
when
you
get
a
girl
up
here
i
doubt
you
be
able
to
plough
and
sow
and
reap
and
manage
all
by
yourselves
and
then
sivert
and
i
can
go
our
ways
that
as
may
be
said
inger
but
i
just
say
this
that
i
could
get
barbro
to
come
now
she
written
home
about
it
what
barbro
said
isak
is
it
that
brede
girl
you
mean
yes
she
in
bergen
now
i
not
have
that
brede
girl
barbro
up
here
said
he
whoever
you
get
i
have
none
of
her
that
was
better
than
nothing
isak
refused
to
have
barbro
he
no
longer
said
they
would
have
no
servant
at
all
barbro
from
breidablik
was
not
the
sort
of
girl
isak
approved
of
she
was
shallow
and
unsettled
like
her
father
maybe
like
her
mother
too
a
careless
creature
no
steady
character
at
all
she
had
not
stayed
long
at
the
lensmand
only
a
year
after
her
confirmation
she
went
to
help
at
the
storekeeper
and
was
there
another
year
here
she
turned
pious
and
got
religion
and
when
the
salvation
army
came
to
the
village
she
joined
it
and
went
about
with
a
red
band
on
her
sleeve
and
carried
a
guitar
she
went
to
bergen
in
that
costume
on
the
storekeeper
boat
that
was
last
year
and
she
had
just
sent
home
a
photograph
of
herself
to
her
people
at
breidablik
isak
had
seen
it
a
strange
young
lady
with
her
hair
curled
up
and
a
long
hanging
down
over
her
breast
her
parents
were
proud
of
little
barbro
and
showed
the
photograph
about
to
all
who
came
was
grand
to
see
how
she
had
learned
town
ways
and
got
on
in
the
world
as
for
the
red
band
and
the
guitar
she
had
given
them
up
it
seemed
i
took
the
picture
along
and
showed
it
to
the
lensmand
lady
said
brede
she
did
know
her
again
is
she
going
to
stay
in
bergen
said
isak
suspiciously
why
unless
she
goes
on
to
christiania
perhaps
said
brede
there
for
her
to
do
here
she
got
a
new
place
now
as
housekeeper
for
two
young
clerks
they
no
wives
nor
womenfolk
of
their
own
and
they
pay
her
well
how
much
said
isak
she
does
say
exactly
in
the
letter
but
it
must
be
something
altogether
different
from
what
folk
pay
down
here
that
plain
why
she
gets
christmas
presents
and
presents
other
times
as
well
and
not
counted
off
her
wages
at
all
ho
said
isak
you
would
like
to
have
her
up
at
your
place
asked
brede
i
said
isak
all
taken
aback
no
of
course
he
he
it
was
only
a
way
of
speaking
barbro
well
enough
where
she
is
what
was
i
going
to
say
you
did
notice
anything
wrong
with
the
line
coming
down
the
telegraph
what
with
the
telegraph
no
no
no
there
not
much
wrong
with
it
now
since
i
took
over
and
then
i
my
own
machine
here
on
the
wall
to
give
a
warning
if
anything
happens
i
have
to
take
a
walk
up
along
the
line
one
of
these
days
and
see
how
things
are
i
too
much
to
manage
and
look
after
is
more
than
one
man
work
but
as
long
as
i
inspector
here
and
hold
an
official
position
of
course
i
ca
neglect
my
duties
if
i
had
the
telegraph
of
course
and
it
may
not
be
for
long
why
said
isak
you
thinking
of
giving
it
up
maybe
well
i
ca
say
exactly
said
brede
i
have
quite
decided
they
want
me
to
move
down
into
the
village
again
who
is
it
wants
you
asked
isak
oh
all
of
them
the
lensmand
wants
me
to
go
and
be
assistant
there
again
and
the
doctor
wants
me
to
drive
for
him
and
the
parson
wife
said
more
than
once
she
misses
me
to
lend
a
hand
if
it
was
such
a
long
way
to
go
how
was
it
with
that
strip
of
hill
isak
the
bit
you
sold
did
you
get
as
much
for
it
as
they
say
ay
is
no
lie
answered
isak
but
what
did
geissler
want
with
it
anyway
it
lies
there
still
curious
thing
year
after
year
and
nothing
done
it
was
a
curious
thing
isak
had
often
wondered
about
it
himself
he
had
spoken
to
the
lensmand
about
it
and
asked
for
geissler
address
thinking
to
write
to
him
ay
it
was
a
mystery
is
more
than
i
can
say
said
isak
brede
made
no
secret
of
his
interest
in
this
matter
of
the
sale
they
say
there
more
of
the
same
sort
up
there
he
said
besides
yours
maybe
there
more
in
it
than
we
know
is
a
pity
that
we
should
sit
here
like
dumb
beasts
and
know
nothing
of
it
all
i
thought
of
going
up
one
day
myself
to
have
a
look
but
do
you
know
anything
about
metals
and
asked
isak
why
i
know
a
bit
and
i
asked
one
or
two
others
anyhow
have
to
find
something
i
ca
live
and
keep
us
all
here
on
this
bit
of
a
farm
it
sheer
impossible
was
another
matter
with
you
got
all
that
timber
and
good
soil
below
is
naught
but
moorland
here
moorland
good
soil
enough
said
isak
shortly
i
the
same
myself
but
there
no
draining
it
said
brede
it
ca
be
done
but
it
could
be
done
coming
down
the
road
that
day
isak
noticed
other
clearings
two
of
them
were
lower
down
nearer
the
village
but
there
was
one
far
up
above
between
breidablik
and
sellanraa
ay
men
were
beginning
to
work
on
the
land
now
in
the
old
days
when
isak
first
came
up
it
had
lain
waste
all
of
it
and
these
three
new
settlers
were
folks
from
another
district
men
with
some
sense
in
their
heads
by
the
look
of
things
they
did
begin
by
borrowing
money
to
build
a
house
no
they
came
up
one
year
and
did
their
spade
work
and
went
away
again
vanished
as
if
they
were
dead
that
was
the
proper
way
ditching
first
then
plough
and
sow
axel
str√∂m
was
nearest
to
land
now
his
neighbour
a
clever
fellow
unmarried
he
came
from
helgeland
he
had
borrowed
isak
new
harrow
to
break
up
his
soil
and
not
till
the
second
year
had
he
set
up
a
hayshed
and
a
turf
hut
for
himself
and
a
couple
of
animals
he
had
called
his
place
maaneland
because
it
looked
nice
in
the
moonlight
he
had
no
womenfolk
himself
and
found
it
difficult
to
get
help
in
the
summer
lying
so
far
out
but
he
managed
things
the
right
way
no
doubt
about
that
not
as
brede
olsen
did
building
a
house
first
and
then
coming
up
with
a
big
family
and
little
ones
and
all
with
neither
soil
nor
stock
to
feed
them
what
did
brede
olsen
know
of
draining
moorland
and
breaking
new
soil
he
knew
how
to
waste
his
time
idling
did
brede
he
came
by
sellanraa
one
day
going
up
to
the
hills
simply
to
look
for
precious
metals
he
came
back
the
same
evening
had
not
found
anything
definite
he
said
but
certain
signs
and
he
nodded
he
would
come
up
again
soon
and
go
over
the
hills
thoroughly
over
towards
sweden
and
sure
enough
brede
came
up
again
he
had
taken
a
fancy
to
the
work
no
doubt
but
he
called
it
telegraph
business
this
time
must
go
up
and
look
over
the
whole
of
the
line
meanwhile
his
wife
and
children
at
home
looked
after
the
farm
or
left
it
to
look
after
itself
isak
was
sick
and
tired
of
brede
visits
and
went
out
of
the
room
when
he
came
then
inger
and
brede
would
sit
talking
heartily
together
what
could
they
have
to
talk
about
brede
often
went
down
to
the
village
and
had
always
some
news
to
tell
of
the
great
folk
there
inger
on
the
other
hand
could
always
draw
upon
her
famous
journey
to
trondhjem
and
her
stay
there
she
had
grown
talkative
in
the
years
she
had
been
away
and
was
always
ready
to
gossip
with
any
one
no
she
was
no
longer
the
same
straightforward
simple
inger
of
the
old
days
girls
and
women
came
up
continually
to
sellanraa
to
have
a
piece
of
work
cut
out
or
a
long
hem
put
through
the
machine
in
a
moment
and
inger
entertained
them
well
oline
too
came
again
could
help
it
belike
came
both
spring
and
autumn
soft
as
butter
and
thoroughly
false
just
looked
along
to
see
how
things
are
with
you
she
said
each
time
and
i
been
longing
so
for
a
sight
of
the
lads
i
that
fond
of
them
the
little
angels
they
were
ay
they
big
fellows
now
but
it
strange
i
ca
forget
the
time
when
they
were
small
and
i
had
them
in
my
care
and
here
you
building
and
building
again
and
making
a
whole
town
of
the
place
going
to
have
a
bell
to
ring
maybe
at
the
roof
of
the
barn
same
as
at
the
parsonage
once
oline
came
and
brought
another
woman
with
her
and
the
pair
of
them
and
inger
had
a
nice
day
together
the
more
inger
had
sitting
round
her
the
better
she
worked
at
her
sewing
and
cutting
out
making
a
show
of
it
waving
her
scissors
and
swinging
the
iron
it
reminded
her
of
the
place
where
she
had
learned
it
all
there
was
always
many
of
them
in
the
workrooms
there
inger
made
no
secret
of
where
she
had
got
her
knowledge
and
all
her
art
from
it
was
from
trondhjem
it
almost
appeared
as
if
she
had
not
been
in
prison
at
all
in
the
ordinary
way
but
at
school
in
an
institute
where
one
could
learn
to
sew
and
weave
and
write
and
do
dressing
and
dyeing
all
that
she
had
learned
in
trondhjem
she
spoke
of
the
place
as
of
a
home
there
were
so
many
people
she
knew
there
superintendents
and
forewomen
and
attendants
it
had
been
dull
and
empty
to
come
back
here
again
and
hard
to
find
herself
altogether
cut
off
from
the
life
and
society
she
had
been
accustomed
to
she
even
made
some
show
of
having
a
cold
could
stand
the
keen
air
there
for
years
after
her
return
she
had
been
too
poorly
to
work
out
of
doors
in
all
seasons
it
was
for
the
outside
work
she
really
ought
to
have
a
servant
ay
heaven
save
us
said
oline
and
why
should
you
have
a
servant
indeed
when
you
means
and
learning
and
a
great
fine
house
and
all
it
was
pleasant
to
meet
with
sympathy
and
inger
did
not
deny
it
she
worked
away
at
her
machine
till
the
place
shook
and
the
ring
on
her
finger
shone
there
you
can
see
for
yourself
said
oline
to
the
woman
with
her
it
true
what
i
said
inger
she
wears
a
gold
ring
on
her
finger
would
you
like
to
see
it
asked
inger
taking
it
off
oline
seemed
still
to
have
her
doubts
she
turned
it
in
her
fingers
as
a
monkey
with
a
nut
looked
at
the
mark
ay
is
as
i
say
inger
with
all
her
means
and
riches
the
other
woman
took
the
ring
with
veneration
and
smiled
humbly
you
can
put
it
on
for
a
bit
if
you
like
said
inger
do
be
afraid
it
wo
break
and
inger
was
amiable
and
kind
she
told
them
about
the
cathedral
at
trondhjem
and
began
like
this
you
have
seen
the
cathedral
at
trondhjem
maybe
no
you
have
been
there
and
it
might
have
been
her
own
cathedral
from
the
way
she
praised
it
boasted
of
it
told
them
height
and
breadth
it
was
a
marvel
seven
priests
could
stand
there
preaching
all
at
once
and
never
hear
one
another
and
then
i
suppose
you
never
seen
olaf
well
right
in
the
middle
of
the
cathedral
itself
it
is
on
one
side
and
it
a
bottomless
well
when
we
went
there
we
took
each
a
little
stone
with
us
and
dropped
it
in
but
it
never
reached
the
bottom
never
reached
the
bottom
whispered
the
two
women
shaking
their
heads
and
there
a
thousand
other
things
besides
in
that
cathedral
exclaimed
inger
delightedly
there
the
silver
chest
to
begin
with
it
holy
olaf
his
own
silver
chest
that
he
had
but
the
marble
church
that
was
a
little
church
all
of
pure
marble
the
danes
took
that
from
us
in
the
war
it
was
time
for
the
women
to
go
oline
took
inger
aside
led
her
out
into
the
larder
where
she
knew
all
the
cheeses
were
stored
and
closed
the
door
what
is
it
asked
inger
oline
whispered
he
does
dare
come
here
any
more
told
him
ho
said
inger
i
told
him
if
he
only
dared
after
what
he
done
to
you
ay
said
inger
but
he
been
here
many
a
time
since
for
all
that
and
he
can
come
if
he
likes
i
not
afraid
no
that
so
said
oline
but
i
know
what
i
know
and
if
you
like
i
lay
a
charge
against
him
ho
said
inger
no
you
no
call
to
do
that
tis
not
worth
it
but
she
was
not
ill
pleased
to
have
oline
on
her
side
it
cost
her
a
cheese
to
be
sure
but
oline
thanked
her
so
fulsomely
is
as
i
say
is
as
i
always
said
inger
she
gives
with
both
hands
nothing
grudging
nothing
sparing
about
her
no
maybe
you
not
afraid
of
but
i
forbid
him
to
come
here
all
the
same
was
the
least
i
could
do
for
you
said
inger
then
what
harm
could
it
do
if
he
did
come
anyway
he
ca
hurt
me
any
more
oline
pricked
up
her
ears
ho
you
learned
a
way
yourself
maybe
i
sha
have
any
more
children
said
inger
and
now
they
were
quits
each
holding
as
good
a
trump
as
the
other
for
oline
stood
there
knowing
all
the
time
that
the
lapp
had
died
the
day
before
why
should
inger
say
that
about
having
no
more
children
she
was
not
on
bad
terms
with
her
husband
was
no
life
between
them
far
from
it
they
had
each
their
own
little
ways
but
it
was
rarely
they
quarrelled
and
never
for
long
at
a
time
it
was
soon
made
up
and
many
a
time
inger
would
suddenly
be
just
as
she
had
been
in
the
old
days
working
hard
in
the
cowshed
or
in
the
field
as
if
she
had
had
a
relapse
into
health
again
and
at
such
times
isak
would
look
at
his
wife
with
grateful
eyes
if
he
had
been
the
sort
of
man
to
speak
his
mind
at
once
he
might
have
said
h
what
does
this
mean
heh
or
something
of
the
sort
just
to
show
he
appreciated
it
but
he
waited
too
long
and
his
praise
came
too
late
so
inger
no
doubt
found
it
not
worth
while
and
did
not
care
to
keep
it
up
she
might
have
had
children
till
past
fifty
as
it
was
she
was
perhaps
hardly
forty
now
she
had
learned
all
sorts
of
things
at
the
institution
had
she
also
learned
to
play
tricks
with
herself
she
had
come
back
so
thoroughly
trained
and
educated
after
her
long
association
with
the
other
murderesses
maybe
the
men
had
taught
her
something
too
the
gaolers
the
doctors
she
told
isak
one
day
what
one
young
medical
man
had
said
of
her
little
crime
why
should
it
be
a
criminal
offence
to
kill
children
ay
even
healthy
children
they
were
nothing
but
lumps
of
flesh
after
all
isak
asked
was
he
terribly
cruel
himself
then
him
exclaimed
inger
and
told
how
kind
he
had
been
to
her
herself
it
was
he
who
had
got
another
doctor
to
operate
on
her
mouth
and
make
a
human
being
of
her
now
there
was
only
a
scar
to
be
seen
only
a
scar
yes
and
a
fine
woman
she
was
in
her
way
tall
and
not
dark
with
rich
hair
in
summer
she
went
barefooted
mostly
and
with
her
skirt
kilted
high
inger
was
not
afraid
of
letting
her
calves
be
seen
isak
saw
them
as
who
did
not
they
did
not
quarrel
no
isak
had
no
talent
for
quarrelling
and
his
wife
had
grown
to
answer
back
a
thorough
good
quarrel
took
a
long
time
to
grow
with
isak
heavy
stub
of
a
man
as
he
was
he
found
himself
all
entangled
in
her
words
and
could
say
next
to
nothing
himself
and
besides
he
was
fond
of
her
powerfully
in
love
was
isak
and
it
was
not
often
he
had
any
need
to
answer
inger
did
not
complain
he
was
an
excellent
husband
in
many
ways
and
she
let
him
alone
what
had
she
to
complain
of
at
all
isak
was
not
a
man
to
be
despised
she
might
have
married
a
worse
worn
out
was
he
true
he
showed
signs
of
being
tired
now
at
times
but
nothing
serious
he
was
full
of
old
health
and
unwasted
strength
like
herself
and
in
this
autumn
of
their
married
life
he
fulfilled
his
part
at
least
as
affectionately
as
she
did
but
nothing
particularly
beautiful
nor
grand
about
him
no
and
here
came
her
superiority
inger
might
well
think
to
herself
at
times
how
she
had
seen
finer
men
handsome
gentlemen
with
and
handkerchiefs
and
starched
collars
to
wear
oh
those
gentlemen
of
the
town
and
so
she
kept
isak
in
his
place
treated
him
as
it
were
no
better
than
he
deserved
he
was
only
a
peasant
a
clodhopper
of
the
wilds
if
her
mouth
had
been
as
it
was
now
from
the
start
she
would
never
have
taken
him
be
sure
of
that
no
she
could
have
done
better
than
that
the
home
he
had
given
her
the
life
he
offered
her
were
poor
enough
she
might
at
least
have
married
some
one
from
her
own
village
and
lived
among
neighbours
with
a
circle
of
friends
instead
of
here
like
an
outcast
in
the
wilds
it
was
not
the
place
for
her
now
she
had
learned
to
look
differently
at
life
strange
how
one
could
come
to
look
differently
at
things
inger
found
no
pleasure
now
in
admiring
a
new
calf
she
did
not
clap
her
hands
in
surprise
when
isak
came
down
from
the
hills
with
a
big
basket
of
fish
no
she
had
lived
for
six
years
among
greater
things
and
of
late
she
had
even
ceased
to
be
heavenly
and
sweet
when
she
called
him
in
to
dinner
your
food
ready
are
you
coming
in
was
all
she
said
now
and
it
did
sound
nice
isak
wondered
a
little
at
first
it
was
a
curious
way
to
speak
a
nasty
uncaring
way
to
speak
and
he
answered
why
i
did
know
was
ready
but
when
inger
pointed
out
that
he
ought
to
have
known
or
might
have
guessed
it
anyway
by
the
sun
he
said
no
more
and
let
the
matter
drop
ah
but
once
he
got
a
hold
on
her
and
used
it
that
was
when
she
tried
to
steal
his
money
from
him
not
that
isak
was
a
miser
in
that
way
but
the
money
was
clearly
his
ho
it
was
nearly
being
ruin
and
disaster
for
her
that
time
but
even
then
it
was
not
exactly
thoroughgoing
wickedness
on
inger
part
she
wanted
the
money
for
eleseus
for
her
blessed
boy
eleseus
in
town
who
was
asking
for
his
again
was
he
to
go
there
among
all
the
fine
folk
and
with
empty
pockets
after
all
she
had
a
mother
heart
she
asked
his
father
for
the
money
first
and
finding
it
was
no
good
had
taken
it
herself
whether
isak
had
had
some
suspicion
beforehand
or
had
found
it
out
by
accident
anyhow
it
was
found
out
and
suddenly
inger
found
herself
gripped
by
both
arms
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
floor
and
thumped
down
on
to
the
floor
again
it
was
something
strange
and
terrible
a
sort
of
avalanche
isak
hands
were
not
weak
not
worn
out
now
inger
gave
a
groan
her
head
fell
back
she
shivered
and
gave
up
the
money
even
then
isak
said
little
though
inger
made
no
attempt
to
hinder
him
from
speaking
what
he
did
say
was
uttered
as
it
were
in
one
hard
breath
huttch
you
you
not
fit
to
have
in
the
place
she
hardly
knew
him
again
oh
but
it
must
have
been
bitterness
that
would
not
be
repressed
a
miserable
day
and
a
long
night
and
a
day
beyond
isak
went
out
of
the
house
and
lay
outside
for
all
that
there
was
hay
to
be
got
in
sivert
was
with
his
father
inger
had
little
leopoldine
and
the
animals
to
keep
her
company
but
lonely
she
was
for
all
that
crying
nearly
all
the
time
and
shaking
her
head
at
herself
only
once
in
all
her
life
before
had
she
felt
so
moved
and
this
day
called
it
to
mind
it
was
when
she
had
lain
in
her
bed
and
throttled
a
newborn
child
where
were
isak
and
his
son
they
had
not
been
idle
no
they
had
stolen
a
day
and
a
night
or
thereabouts
from
the
haymaking
and
had
built
a
boat
up
on
the
lake
oh
a
rough
and
vessel
enough
but
strong
and
sound
as
their
work
had
always
been
they
had
a
boat
now
and
could
go
fishing
with
nets
when
they
came
home
the
hay
was
dry
as
ever
they
had
cheated
providence
by
trusting
it
and
suffered
no
loss
they
had
gained
by
it
and
then
sivert
flung
out
an
arm
and
said
ho
mother
been
haymaking
isak
looked
down
over
the
fields
and
said
h
isak
had
noticed
already
that
some
of
the
hay
had
been
shifted
inger
ought
to
be
home
now
for
her
midday
meal
it
was
well
done
indeed
of
her
to
get
in
the
hay
after
he
had
scolded
her
the
day
before
and
said
huttch
and
it
was
no
light
hay
to
move
she
must
have
worked
hard
and
all
the
cows
and
goats
to
milk
besides
go
in
and
get
something
to
eat
he
said
to
sivert
are
you
coming
then
no
a
little
while
after
inger
came
out
and
stood
humbly
on
the
and
said
if
you
think
of
yourself
a
little
and
come
in
and
have
a
bite
to
eat
isak
grumbled
at
that
and
said
h
but
it
was
so
strange
a
thing
of
late
for
inger
to
be
humble
in
any
way
that
his
stubbornness
was
shaken
if
you
could
manage
to
set
a
couple
of
teeth
in
my
rake
i
could
get
on
again
with
the
hay
said
she
ay
she
came
to
her
husband
the
master
of
the
place
to
ask
for
something
and
was
grateful
that
he
did
not
turn
scornfully
away
you
worked
enough
said
he
raking
and
carting
and
all
no
is
not
enough
i
no
time
anyway
to
mend
rakes
now
you
can
see
there
rain
coming
soon
and
isak
went
off
to
his
work
it
was
all
meant
to
save
her
no
doubt
for
the
couple
of
minutes
it
would
have
taken
to
mend
the
rake
would
have
been
more
than
tenfold
repaid
by
letting
inger
work
on
anyhow
inger
came
out
with
her
rake
as
it
was
and
fell
to
haymaking
with
a
will
sivert
came
up
with
the
horse
and
haycart
and
all
went
at
it
sweating
at
the
work
and
the
hay
was
got
in
it
was
a
good
stroke
of
work
and
isak
fell
to
thinking
once
more
of
the
powers
above
that
guide
all
our
ways
from
stealing
a
to
getting
a
crop
of
hay
moreover
there
lay
the
boat
after
half
a
generation
of
thinking
it
over
the
boat
was
finished
it
was
there
up
on
the
lake
eyah
said
isak
chapter
xv
it
was
a
strange
evening
altogether
a
inger
had
been
running
off
the
line
for
a
long
time
now
and
one
lift
up
from
the
floor
had
set
her
in
her
place
again
neither
spoke
of
what
had
happened
isak
had
felt
ashamed
of
himself
after
all
for
the
sake
of
a
a
trifle
of
money
that
he
would
have
had
to
give
her
after
all
because
he
himself
would
gladly
have
let
the
boy
have
it
and
then
again
was
not
the
money
as
much
inger
as
his
own
there
came
a
time
when
isak
found
it
his
turn
to
be
humble
there
came
many
sorts
of
times
inger
must
have
changed
her
mind
again
it
seemed
once
more
she
was
different
gradually
forgetting
her
fine
ways
and
turning
earnest
anew
a
settler
wife
earnest
and
thoughtful
as
she
had
been
before
to
think
that
a
man
hard
grip
could
work
such
wonders
but
it
was
right
here
was
a
strong
and
healthy
woman
sensible
enough
but
spoiled
and
warped
by
long
confinement
in
an
artificial
air
and
she
had
butted
into
a
man
who
stood
firmly
on
his
feet
never
for
a
moment
had
he
left
his
natural
place
on
the
earth
on
the
soil
nothing
could
move
him
many
sorts
of
times
next
year
came
the
drought
again
killing
the
growth
off
slowly
and
wearing
down
human
courage
the
corn
stood
there
and
shrivelled
up
the
potatoes
the
wonderful
potatoes
they
did
not
shrivel
up
but
flowered
and
flowered
the
meadows
turned
grey
but
the
potatoes
flowered
the
powers
above
guided
all
things
no
doubt
but
the
meadows
were
turning
grey
then
one
day
came
geissler
geissler
came
again
at
last
it
was
good
to
find
that
he
was
not
dead
but
had
turned
up
again
and
what
had
he
come
for
now
geissler
had
no
grand
surprises
with
him
this
time
by
the
look
of
it
no
purchases
of
mining
rights
and
documents
and
geissler
was
poorly
dressed
his
hair
and
beard
turned
greyer
and
his
eyes
redder
at
the
edges
than
before
he
had
no
man
either
to
carry
his
things
but
had
his
papers
in
a
pocket
and
not
even
a
bag
said
geissler
answered
isak
and
inger
here
the
like
of
visitors
to
see
this
way
geissler
nodded
and
thanks
for
all
you
did
that
time
in
trondhjem
said
inger
all
by
herself
and
isak
nodded
at
that
and
said
ay
is
two
of
us
owe
you
thanks
for
that
but
geissler
it
was
not
his
way
to
be
all
feelings
and
sentiments
he
said
yes
i
just
going
across
to
sweden
for
all
their
trouble
of
mind
over
the
drought
sellanraa
folk
were
glad
to
see
geissler
again
they
gave
him
the
best
they
had
and
were
heartily
glad
to
do
what
they
could
for
him
after
all
he
had
done
geissler
himself
had
no
troubles
that
could
be
seen
he
grew
talkative
at
once
looked
out
over
the
fields
and
nodded
he
carried
himself
upright
as
ever
and
looked
as
if
he
had
several
hundreds
of
in
his
pockets
it
livened
them
up
and
brightened
everything
to
have
him
there
not
that
he
made
any
boisterous
fun
but
a
lively
talker
that
he
was
fine
place
sellanraa
splendid
place
he
said
and
now
others
coming
up
one
after
another
since
you
started
isak
i
counted
five
myself
are
there
any
more
seven
in
all
there
two
that
ca
be
seen
from
the
road
seven
holdings
say
fifty
souls
why
it
be
a
densely
populated
neighbourhood
before
long
and
you
a
school
already
so
i
hear
ay
we
have
there
what
did
i
say
a
school
all
to
yourselves
down
by
place
being
more
in
the
middle
fancy
brede
as
a
farmer
in
the
wilds
and
geissler
laughed
at
the
thought
ay
i
heard
all
about
you
isak
you
the
best
man
here
and
i
glad
of
it
sawmill
too
you
got
ay
such
as
it
is
but
it
serves
me
well
enough
and
i
sawed
a
bit
now
and
again
for
them
down
below
bravo
that
the
way
i
be
glad
to
hear
what
you
think
of
it
lensmand
if
so
be
care
to
look
at
that
sawmill
for
yourself
geissler
nodded
with
the
air
of
an
expert
yes
he
would
look
at
it
examine
it
thoroughly
then
he
asked
you
had
two
boys
you
what
become
of
the
other
in
town
clerk
in
an
office
h
said
geissler
but
this
one
here
looks
a
sturdy
sort
what
was
your
name
now
sivert
and
the
other
one
eleseus
and
he
in
an
engineer
office
what
he
reckon
to
learn
there
a
much
better
have
come
to
me
said
geissler
ay
said
isak
for
politeness
sake
he
felt
a
sort
of
pity
for
geissler
at
the
moment
oh
that
good
man
did
not
look
as
if
he
could
afford
to
keep
clerks
had
to
work
hard
enough
by
himself
belike
that
jacket
it
was
worn
to
fringes
at
the
wrists
wo
you
have
some
dry
hose
to
put
on
said
inger
and
brought
out
a
pair
of
her
own
they
were
from
her
best
days
fine
and
thin
with
a
border
no
thanks
said
geissler
shortly
though
he
must
have
been
wet
much
better
have
come
to
me
he
said
again
speaking
of
eleseus
i
want
him
badly
he
took
a
small
silver
tobacco
box
from
his
pocket
and
sat
playing
with
it
in
his
fingers
it
was
perhaps
the
only
thing
of
value
left
him
now
but
geissler
was
restless
changing
from
one
thing
to
another
he
slipped
the
thing
back
into
his
pocket
again
and
started
a
new
theme
but
what
that
why
the
meadow
that
all
grey
i
thought
it
was
the
shadow
the
ground
is
simply
parched
come
along
with
me
sivert
he
rose
from
the
table
suddenly
thinking
no
more
of
food
turned
in
the
doorway
to
say
thank
you
to
inger
for
the
meal
and
disappeared
sivert
following
they
went
across
to
the
river
geissler
peering
keenly
about
all
the
time
here
he
cried
and
stopped
and
then
he
explained
the
sense
of
letting
your
land
dry
up
to
nothing
when
you
a
river
there
big
enough
to
drown
it
in
a
minute
we
have
that
meadow
green
by
tomorrow
sivert
all
astonishment
said
yes
dig
down
obliquely
from
here
see
on
a
slope
the
ground
level
have
to
make
some
sort
of
a
channel
you
a
sawmill
there
i
suppose
you
can
find
some
long
planks
from
somewhere
good
run
and
fetch
a
pick
and
spade
and
start
here
i
go
back
and
mark
out
a
proper
line
he
ran
up
to
the
house
again
his
boots
squelching
for
they
were
wet
through
he
set
isak
to
work
making
pipes
a
whole
lot
of
them
to
be
laid
down
where
the
ground
could
not
well
be
cut
with
ditches
isak
tried
to
object
that
the
water
might
not
get
so
far
the
dry
ground
would
soak
it
up
before
it
reached
the
parched
fields
geissler
explained
that
it
would
take
some
time
the
earth
must
drink
a
little
first
but
then
gradually
the
water
would
go
on
field
and
meadow
green
by
this
time
tomorrow
ho
said
isak
and
fell
to
boxing
up
long
planks
as
hard
as
he
could
off
hurries
geissler
to
sivert
once
more
that
right
keep
at
it
did
i
say
he
was
a
sturdy
sort
follow
these
stakes
you
understand
where
i
marked
out
if
you
come
up
against
heavy
boulders
or
rock
then
turn
aside
and
go
round
but
keep
the
level
the
same
depth
you
see
what
i
mean
then
back
to
isak
again
that
one
finished
good
but
we
shall
want
more
half
a
dozen
perhaps
keep
at
it
isak
you
see
we
have
it
all
green
by
tomorrow
we
saved
your
crops
and
geissler
sat
down
on
the
ground
slapped
his
knees
with
both
hands
and
was
delighted
chattered
away
thought
in
flashes
of
lightning
any
pitch
any
oakum
or
anything
about
the
place
that
splendid
got
everything
these
things
leak
at
the
edges
you
see
to
begin
with
but
the
wood
swell
after
a
while
and
they
be
as
taut
as
a
bottle
oakum
and
pitch
fancy
you
having
it
too
what
built
a
boat
you
say
where
is
the
boat
up
in
the
lake
good
i
must
have
a
look
at
that
too
oh
geissler
was
all
promises
light
come
light
go
and
he
seemed
more
giving
to
fussing
about
than
before
he
worked
at
things
by
fits
and
starts
but
at
a
furious
rate
when
he
did
work
there
was
a
certain
superiority
about
him
after
all
true
he
exaggerated
a
bit
it
was
impossible
of
course
to
get
all
green
by
this
time
tomorrow
as
he
had
said
but
for
all
that
geissler
was
a
sharp
fellow
quick
to
see
and
take
a
decision
ay
a
strange
man
was
geissler
and
it
was
he
and
no
other
that
saved
the
crops
that
year
at
sellanraa
how
many
have
you
got
done
not
enough
the
more
wood
you
can
lay
the
quicker
it
flow
make
them
twenty
feet
long
or
if
you
can
any
planks
that
length
on
the
place
good
fetch
them
along
you
find
it
pay
you
at
restless
again
up
and
off
to
sivert
once
more
that
the
way
sivert
man
getting
on
finely
your
father
turning
out
culverts
like
a
poet
there
be
more
than
i
ever
thought
run
across
and
get
some
now
and
we
make
a
start
all
that
afternoon
was
one
hurrying
spell
sivert
had
never
seen
such
a
furious
piece
of
work
he
was
not
accustomed
to
see
things
done
at
that
pace
they
hardly
gave
themselves
time
to
eat
but
the
water
was
flowing
already
here
and
there
they
had
to
dig
deeper
a
culvert
had
to
be
raised
or
lowered
but
it
flowed
the
three
men
were
at
it
till
late
that
night
touching
up
their
work
and
keenly
on
the
look
out
for
any
fault
but
when
the
water
began
to
trickle
out
over
the
driest
spots
there
was
joy
and
delight
at
sellanraa
i
forgot
to
bring
my
watch
said
geissler
what
the
time
i
wonder
ay
she
be
green
by
this
time
tomorrow
said
he
sivert
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
see
how
things
were
going
and
found
his
father
out
already
on
the
same
errand
oh
but
it
was
a
thrilling
time
a
day
of
great
events
but
next
day
geissler
stayed
in
bed
till
nearly
noon
worn
out
now
that
the
fit
had
passed
he
did
not
trouble
to
go
up
and
look
at
the
boat
on
the
lake
and
but
for
what
he
had
said
the
day
before
he
would
never
have
bothered
to
look
at
the
sawmill
even
the
irrigation
works
interested
him
less
than
at
first
and
when
he
saw
that
neither
field
nor
meadow
had
turned
green
in
the
course
of
the
night
he
lost
heart
never
thinking
of
how
the
water
flowed
and
flowed
all
the
time
and
spread
out
farther
and
farther
over
the
ground
he
backed
down
a
little
and
said
now
it
may
take
time
you
wo
see
any
change
perhaps
before
tomorrow
again
but
it
be
all
right
never
fear
later
in
the
day
brede
olsen
came
lounging
in
he
had
brought
some
samples
of
rock
he
wanted
geissler
to
see
and
something
out
of
the
common
this
time
to
my
mind
said
brede
geissler
would
not
look
at
the
things
that
the
way
you
manage
a
farm
he
asked
scornfully
pottering
about
up
in
the
hills
looking
for
a
fortune
brede
apparently
did
not
fancy
being
taken
to
task
now
by
his
former
chief
he
answered
sharply
without
any
form
of
respect
treating
the
as
an
equal
if
you
think
i
care
what
you
say
you
no
more
sense
than
you
had
before
said
geissler
fooling
away
your
time
what
about
yourself
said
brede
what
about
you
i
like
to
know
you
got
a
mine
of
your
own
up
here
and
what
have
you
done
with
it
huh
lies
there
doing
nothing
ay
you
the
sort
to
have
a
mine
are
you
he
he
get
out
of
this
said
geissler
and
brede
did
not
stay
long
but
shouldered
his
load
of
samples
and
went
down
to
his
own
without
saying
geissler
sat
down
and
began
to
look
over
some
papers
with
a
thoughtful
air
he
seemed
to
have
caught
a
touch
of
the
fever
himself
and
wanted
now
to
look
over
that
business
of
the
copper
mine
the
contract
the
analyses
it
was
fine
ore
almost
pure
copper
he
must
do
something
with
it
and
not
let
everything
slide
what
i
really
came
up
for
was
to
get
the
whole
thing
settled
he
said
to
isak
i
been
thinking
of
making
a
start
here
and
that
very
soon
get
a
lot
of
men
to
work
and
run
the
thing
properly
what
do
you
think
isak
felt
sorry
for
the
man
and
would
not
say
anything
against
it
it
a
matter
that
concerns
you
as
well
you
know
there
be
a
lot
of
bother
of
course
a
lot
of
men
about
the
place
and
a
bit
rowdy
at
times
perhaps
and
blasting
up
in
the
hills
i
do
know
how
like
that
on
the
other
hand
there
be
more
life
in
the
district
where
we
begin
and
you
have
a
good
market
close
at
hand
for
farm
produce
and
that
sort
of
thing
fix
your
own
price
too
ay
said
isak
besides
your
share
in
the
mine
you
get
a
high
percentage
of
earnings
you
know
big
money
isak
said
isak
you
paid
me
fairly
already
and
more
than
enough
next
morning
geissler
left
hurrying
off
eastward
over
toward
sweden
no
thanks
he
said
shortly
when
isak
offered
to
go
with
him
it
was
almost
painful
to
see
him
start
off
in
that
poor
fashion
on
foot
and
all
alone
inger
had
put
up
a
fine
parcel
of
food
for
him
to
take
all
as
nice
as
she
could
make
it
and
made
some
wafers
specially
to
put
in
even
that
was
not
enough
she
would
have
given
him
a
can
of
cream
and
a
whole
lot
of
eggs
but
he
would
carry
them
and
inger
was
disappointed
geissler
himself
must
have
found
it
hard
to
leave
sellanraa
without
paying
as
he
generally
did
for
his
keep
so
he
pretended
that
he
had
paid
made
as
if
he
had
laid
down
a
big
note
in
payment
and
said
to
little
leopoldine
here
child
here
something
for
you
as
well
and
with
that
he
gave
her
the
silver
box
his
tobacco
box
you
can
rinse
it
out
and
use
it
to
keep
pins
and
things
in
he
said
not
the
sort
of
thing
for
a
present
really
if
i
were
at
home
i
could
have
found
her
something
else
i
a
heap
of
things
but
geissler
waterwork
remained
after
geissler
had
gone
there
it
was
working
wonders
day
and
night
week
after
week
the
fields
turned
green
the
potatoes
ceased
to
flower
the
corn
shot
up
the
settlers
from
the
holdings
farther
down
began
to
come
up
all
anxious
to
see
the
marvel
for
themselves
axel
str√∂m
the
neighbour
from
maaneland
the
man
who
had
no
wife
and
no
woman
to
help
him
but
managed
for
himself
he
came
too
he
was
in
a
good
humour
that
day
he
told
them
how
he
had
just
got
a
promise
of
a
girl
to
help
through
the
summer
and
that
was
a
weight
off
his
mind
he
did
not
say
who
the
girl
was
and
isak
did
not
ask
but
it
was
brede
girl
barbro
who
was
to
come
it
would
cost
the
price
of
a
telegram
to
bergen
to
fetch
her
but
axel
paid
the
money
though
he
was
not
one
of
your
extravagant
sort
but
rather
something
of
a
miser
it
was
the
waterwork
business
that
had
enticed
him
up
today
he
had
looked
it
over
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
was
highly
interested
there
was
no
big
river
on
his
land
but
he
had
a
bit
of
a
stream
he
had
no
planks
either
to
make
culverts
with
but
he
would
dig
his
channels
in
the
earth
it
could
be
done
up
to
now
things
were
not
absolutely
at
their
worst
on
his
land
which
lay
lower
down
the
slopes
but
if
the
drought
continued
he
too
would
have
to
irrigate
when
he
had
seen
what
he
wanted
he
took
his
leave
and
went
back
at
once
no
he
would
not
come
in
had
the
time
he
was
going
to
start
ditching
that
same
evening
and
off
he
went
this
was
something
different
from
brede
way
oh
brede
he
could
run
about
the
moorland
farms
now
telling
news
miraculous
waterworks
at
sellanraa
it
does
pay
to
work
your
soil
overmuch
he
had
said
look
at
isak
up
there
he
dug
and
dug
about
so
long
that
at
last
he
had
to
water
the
whole
ground
isak
was
patient
but
he
wished
many
a
time
that
he
could
get
rid
of
the
fellow
hanging
about
sellanraa
with
his
boastful
ways
brede
put
it
all
down
to
the
telegraph
as
long
as
he
was
a
public
official
it
was
his
duty
to
keep
the
line
in
order
but
the
telegraph
company
had
already
had
occasion
several
times
to
reprimand
him
for
neglect
and
had
again
offered
the
post
to
isak
no
it
was
not
the
telegraph
that
was
in
brede
mind
all
the
time
but
the
ore
up
in
the
hills
it
was
his
one
idea
now
a
mania
he
took
to
dropping
in
often
now
at
sellanraa
confident
that
he
had
found
the
treasure
he
would
nod
his
head
and
say
i
ca
tell
you
all
about
it
yet
but
i
do
mind
saying
i
struck
something
remarkable
this
time
wasting
hours
and
energy
all
for
nothing
and
when
he
came
back
in
the
evening
to
his
little
house
he
would
fling
down
a
little
sack
of
samples
on
the
floor
and
puff
and
blow
after
his
day
work
as
if
no
man
could
have
toiled
harder
for
his
daily
bread
he
grew
a
few
potatoes
on
sour
peaty
soil
and
cut
the
tufts
of
grass
that
grew
by
themselves
on
the
ground
about
the
house
that
was
brede
farming
he
was
never
made
for
a
farmer
and
there
could
be
but
one
end
to
it
all
his
turf
roof
was
falling
to
pieces
already
and
the
steps
to
the
kitchen
were
rotten
with
damp
a
grindstone
lay
on
the
ground
and
the
cart
was
still
left
uncovered
in
the
open
brede
was
fortunate
perhaps
in
that
such
little
matters
never
troubled
him
when
the
children
rolled
his
grindstone
about
for
play
he
was
kind
and
indulgent
and
would
even
help
them
to
roll
it
himself
an
idle
nature
never
serious
but
also
never
a
weak
irresponsible
character
but
he
managed
to
find
food
such
as
it
was
and
kept
himself
and
his
alive
from
day
to
day
managed
to
keep
them
somehow
but
it
was
not
to
be
expected
that
the
storekeeper
could
go
on
feeding
brede
and
his
family
for
ever
he
had
said
so
more
than
once
to
brede
himself
and
he
said
it
now
in
earnest
brede
admitted
he
was
right
and
promised
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
he
would
sell
his
place
and
very
likely
make
a
good
thing
out
of
it
and
pay
what
he
owed
at
the
store
oh
but
brede
would
sell
out
anyhow
even
at
a
loss
what
was
the
good
of
a
farm
for
him
he
was
for
the
village
again
the
easy
gossiping
life
there
and
the
little
shop
it
suited
him
better
than
settling
down
here
to
work
and
trying
to
forget
the
world
outside
could
he
ever
forget
the
christmas
trees
and
parties
or
the
national
feastings
on
constitution
day
or
the
bazaars
held
in
the
he
loved
to
talk
with
his
kind
to
exchange
news
and
views
but
who
was
there
to
talk
with
here
inger
up
at
sellanraa
had
seemed
to
be
one
of
his
sort
for
a
while
but
then
she
had
changed
there
was
no
getting
a
word
out
of
her
now
and
besides
she
had
been
in
prison
and
for
a
man
in
his
position
no
it
would
never
do
no
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
ever
leaving
the
village
it
was
throwing
himself
away
he
noted
with
envy
that
the
lensmand
had
got
another
assistant
and
the
doctor
another
man
to
drive
for
him
he
had
run
away
from
the
people
who
needed
him
and
now
that
he
was
no
longer
there
they
managed
without
him
but
the
men
who
had
taken
his
place
they
were
no
earthly
good
of
course
properly
speaking
he
brede
ought
to
be
fetched
back
to
the
village
in
triumph
then
there
was
barbro
why
had
he
backed
up
the
idea
of
getting
her
to
go
as
help
to
sellanraa
well
that
was
after
talking
over
things
with
his
wife
if
all
went
well
it
might
mean
a
good
future
for
the
girl
perhaps
a
future
of
a
sort
for
all
of
them
all
very
well
to
be
housekeeper
for
two
young
clerks
in
bergen
but
who
could
say
what
she
would
get
out
of
that
in
the
long
run
barbro
was
a
pretty
girl
and
liked
to
look
well
there
might
be
a
better
chance
for
her
here
after
all
for
there
were
two
sons
at
sellanraa
but
when
brede
saw
that
this
plan
would
never
come
to
anything
he
hit
on
another
after
all
there
was
no
great
catch
in
marrying
into
inger
lot
inger
who
had
been
in
prison
and
there
were
other
lads
to
be
thought
of
besides
those
two
sellanraa
boys
there
was
axel
str√∂m
for
instance
he
had
a
farm
and
a
hut
of
his
own
he
was
a
man
who
scraped
and
saved
and
little
by
little
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
bit
of
live
stock
and
but
with
no
wife
and
no
woman
to
help
him
well
i
do
mind
telling
you
if
you
take
barbro
be
all
the
help
you
need
said
brede
to
him
look
here
her
picture
you
can
see
and
after
a
week
or
so
came
barbro
axel
was
in
the
midst
of
his
haymaking
and
had
to
do
his
mowing
by
day
and
haymaking
by
night
and
all
by
himself
and
then
came
barbro
it
was
a
godsend
barbro
soon
showed
she
was
not
afraid
of
work
she
washed
clothes
and
cleaned
things
cooked
and
milked
and
helped
in
the
hayfield
helped
to
carry
in
the
hay
she
did
axel
determined
to
give
her
good
wages
and
not
lose
by
it
she
was
not
merely
a
photograph
of
a
fine
lady
here
barbro
was
straight
and
thin
spoke
somewhat
hoarsely
showed
sense
and
experience
in
various
ways
she
was
not
a
child
axel
wondered
what
made
her
so
thin
and
haggard
in
the
face
i
know
you
by
your
looks
he
said
but
you
not
like
the
photograph
that
only
the
journey
she
said
and
living
in
town
air
all
that
time
and
indeed
she
very
soon
grew
plump
and
again
take
my
word
for
it
said
barbro
it
pulls
you
down
a
bit
a
journey
like
that
and
living
in
town
like
that
she
hinted
also
at
the
temptations
of
life
in
bergen
one
had
to
be
careful
there
but
while
they
sat
talking
she
begged
him
to
take
in
a
paper
a
bergen
newspaper
so
that
she
could
read
a
bit
and
see
the
news
of
the
world
she
had
got
accustomed
to
reading
and
theatres
and
music
and
it
was
so
dull
in
a
place
like
this
axel
was
pleased
with
the
results
of
his
summer
help
and
took
in
a
paper
he
also
bore
with
the
frequent
visits
of
the
brede
family
who
were
constantly
dropping
in
at
his
place
and
eating
and
drinking
he
was
anxious
to
show
that
he
appreciated
this
of
his
and
what
could
be
nicer
and
homelier
than
when
barbro
sat
there
of
a
sunday
evening
twanging
the
strings
of
a
guitar
and
singing
a
little
with
her
hoarse
voice
axel
was
touched
by
it
all
by
the
pretty
strange
songs
by
the
mere
fact
that
some
one
really
sat
there
singing
on
his
poor
farm
true
in
the
course
of
the
summer
he
learned
to
know
other
sides
of
barbro
character
but
on
the
whole
he
was
content
she
had
her
fancies
and
could
answer
hastily
at
times
was
somewhat
to
answer
back
that
saturday
evening
for
instance
when
axel
himself
had
to
go
down
to
the
village
to
get
some
things
it
was
wrong
of
barbro
to
run
away
from
the
hut
and
the
animals
and
leave
the
place
to
itself
they
had
a
few
words
over
that
and
where
had
she
been
only
to
her
home
to
breidablik
but
still
when
axel
came
back
to
the
hut
that
night
barbro
was
not
there
he
looked
to
the
animals
got
himself
something
to
eat
and
turned
in
towards
morning
barbro
came
i
only
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
to
step
on
a
wooden
floor
again
she
said
somewhat
scornfully
and
axel
could
find
nothing
much
to
say
to
that
seeing
that
he
had
as
yet
but
a
turf
hut
with
a
floor
of
beaten
earth
he
did
say
however
that
if
it
came
to
that
he
could
get
a
few
planks
himself
and
no
doubt
but
he
have
a
house
with
a
wooden
floor
himself
in
time
barbro
seemed
penitent
at
that
she
was
not
altogether
unkindly
and
for
all
it
was
sunday
she
went
off
at
once
to
the
woods
and
gathered
fresh
juniper
twigs
to
spread
on
the
earthen
floor
and
then
seeing
she
was
so
and
behaved
so
splendidly
what
could
axel
do
but
bring
out
the
kerchief
he
had
bought
for
her
the
evening
before
though
he
had
really
thought
of
keeping
it
by
a
while
and
getting
something
respectable
out
of
her
in
return
and
there
she
was
pleased
with
it
and
tried
it
on
at
once
ay
she
turned
to
him
and
asked
if
she
did
look
nice
in
it
and
yes
indeed
she
did
and
she
might
put
on
his
old
fur
cap
if
she
liked
and
look
nice
in
that
barbro
laughed
at
this
and
tried
to
say
something
really
nice
in
return
she
said
i
far
rather
go
to
church
and
communion
in
this
kerchief
than
wear
a
hat
in
bergen
of
course
we
always
wore
hats
all
except
common
from
the
country
friends
again
as
nice
as
could
be
and
when
axel
brought
out
the
newspaper
he
had
fetched
from
the
post
office
barbro
sat
down
to
read
news
of
the
world
of
a
burglary
at
a
jeweller
shop
in
one
bergen
street
and
a
quarrel
between
two
gipsies
in
another
of
a
horrible
find
in
the
harbour
the
dead
body
of
a
newborn
child
sewed
up
in
an
old
shirt
with
the
sleeves
cut
off
i
wonder
who
can
have
done
it
said
barbro
and
she
read
the
list
of
marketing
prices
too
as
she
always
did
so
the
summer
passed
chapter
xvi
great
changes
at
sellanraa
there
was
no
knowing
the
place
again
after
what
it
had
been
at
first
sawmill
cornmill
buildings
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
the
wilderness
was
peopled
country
now
and
there
was
more
to
come
but
inger
was
perhaps
the
strangest
of
all
so
altered
she
was
and
good
and
clever
again
the
great
event
of
last
year
when
things
had
come
to
a
head
was
hardly
enough
in
itself
perhaps
to
change
her
careless
ways
there
was
backsliding
now
and
then
as
when
she
found
herself
beginning
to
talk
of
the
institute
again
and
the
cathedral
at
trondhjem
oh
innocent
things
enough
and
she
took
off
her
ring
and
let
down
that
bold
skirt
of
hers
some
inches
she
was
grown
thoughtful
there
was
more
quiet
about
the
place
and
visits
were
less
frequent
the
girls
and
women
from
the
village
came
but
rarely
now
for
inger
no
longer
cared
to
see
them
no
one
can
live
in
the
depth
of
the
wilds
and
have
time
for
such
foolishness
happiness
and
nonsense
are
two
different
things
in
the
wilds
each
season
has
its
wonders
but
always
unchangingly
there
is
that
immense
heavy
sound
of
heaven
and
earth
the
sense
of
being
surrounded
on
all
sides
the
darkness
of
the
forest
the
kindliness
of
the
trees
all
is
heavy
and
soft
no
thought
is
impossible
there
north
of
sellanraa
there
was
a
little
tarn
a
mere
puddle
no
bigger
than
an
aquarium
there
lived
some
tiny
baby
fish
that
never
grew
bigger
lived
and
died
there
and
were
no
use
at
all
no
use
on
earth
one
evening
inger
stood
there
listening
for
the
cowbells
all
was
dead
about
her
she
heard
nothing
and
then
came
a
song
from
the
tarn
a
little
little
song
hardly
there
at
all
almost
lost
it
was
the
tiny
fishes
song
they
had
this
good
fortune
at
sellanraa
that
every
spring
and
autumn
they
could
see
the
grey
geese
sailing
in
fleets
above
that
wilderness
and
hear
their
chatter
up
in
the
air
delirious
talk
it
was
and
as
if
the
world
stood
still
for
a
moment
till
the
train
of
them
had
passed
and
the
human
souls
beneath
did
they
not
feel
a
weakness
gliding
through
them
now
they
went
to
their
work
again
but
drawing
breath
first
something
had
spoken
to
them
something
from
beyond
great
marvels
were
about
them
at
all
times
in
the
winter
were
the
stars
in
winter
often
too
the
northern
lights
a
firmament
of
wings
a
conflagration
in
the
mansions
of
god
now
and
then
not
often
not
commonly
but
now
and
then
they
heard
the
thunder
it
came
mostly
in
the
autumn
and
a
dark
and
solemn
thing
it
was
for
man
and
beast
the
animals
grazing
near
home
would
bunch
together
and
stand
waiting
bowing
their
heads
what
for
waiting
for
the
end
and
man
what
of
man
standing
in
the
wilds
with
bowed
head
waiting
when
the
thunder
came
waiting
for
what
the
spring
ay
with
its
haste
and
joy
and
madcap
delight
but
the
autumn
it
called
up
a
fear
of
darkness
drove
one
to
an
evening
prayer
there
were
visions
about
and
warnings
on
the
air
folks
might
go
out
one
day
in
autumn
seeking
for
something
the
man
for
a
piece
of
timber
to
his
work
the
woman
after
cattle
that
ran
wild
now
after
mushroom
growths
they
would
come
home
with
many
secrets
in
their
mind
did
they
tread
unexpectedly
upon
an
ant
crushing
its
hind
part
fast
to
the
path
so
the
fore
part
could
not
free
itself
again
or
step
too
near
a
white
grouse
nest
putting
up
a
fluttering
hissing
mother
to
dash
against
them
even
the
big
are
not
altogether
meaningless
not
a
mere
white
emptiness
in
the
eye
the
big
mushroom
does
not
flower
it
does
not
move
but
there
is
something
overturning
in
the
look
of
it
it
is
a
monster
a
thing
like
a
lung
standing
there
alive
and
naked
a
lung
without
a
body
inger
grew
despondent
at
last
the
wilds
oppressed
her
she
turned
religious
how
could
she
help
it
no
one
can
help
it
in
the
wilds
life
there
is
not
all
earthly
toil
and
worldliness
there
is
piety
and
the
fear
of
death
and
rich
superstition
inger
maybe
felt
that
she
had
more
reason
than
others
to
fear
the
judgment
of
heaven
and
it
would
not
pass
her
by
she
knew
how
god
walked
about
in
the
evening
time
looking
out
over
all
his
wilderness
with
fabulous
eyes
ay
he
would
find
her
there
was
not
so
much
in
her
daily
life
wherein
she
could
improve
true
she
might
bury
her
gold
ring
deep
in
the
bottom
of
a
clothes
chest
and
she
could
write
to
eleseus
and
tell
him
to
be
converted
too
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
she
could
find
beyond
doing
her
work
well
and
not
sparing
herself
ay
one
thing
more
she
could
dress
in
humble
things
only
fastening
a
blue
ribbon
at
her
neck
of
sundays
false
unnecessary
poverty
but
it
was
the
expression
of
a
kind
of
philosophy
stoicism
the
blue
ribbon
was
not
new
it
had
been
cut
from
a
cap
little
leopoldine
had
grown
out
of
it
was
faded
here
and
there
and
to
tell
the
truth
a
little
dirty
inger
wore
it
now
as
a
piece
of
modest
finery
on
holy
days
ay
it
may
be
that
she
went
beyond
reason
feigning
to
be
poor
striving
falsely
to
imitate
the
wretched
who
live
in
hovels
but
even
so
would
her
desert
have
been
greater
if
that
sorry
finery
had
been
her
best
leave
her
in
peace
she
has
a
right
to
peace
she
overdid
things
finely
and
worked
harder
than
she
ought
there
were
two
men
on
the
place
but
inger
took
the
chance
when
both
were
away
at
once
and
set
to
work
herself
sawing
wood
and
where
was
the
good
of
torturing
and
mortifying
the
flesh
that
way
she
was
so
insignificant
a
creature
so
little
worth
her
powers
of
so
common
a
sort
her
death
or
life
would
not
be
noticed
in
the
land
in
the
state
only
here
in
the
wilds
here
she
was
almost
great
at
any
rate
the
greatest
and
she
may
well
have
thought
herself
worth
all
the
chastening
she
ordered
and
endured
her
husband
said
sivert
and
i
we
been
talking
about
this
we
not
going
to
have
you
sawing
wood
and
wearing
yourself
out
i
do
it
for
conscience
sake
she
answered
conscience
the
word
made
isak
thoughtful
once
more
he
was
getting
on
in
years
slow
to
think
but
weighty
when
he
did
come
to
anything
conscience
must
be
something
pretty
strong
if
it
could
turn
inger
all
upside
down
like
that
and
however
it
might
be
inger
conversion
made
a
change
in
him
also
he
caught
it
from
her
grew
tame
and
given
to
pondering
life
was
all
and
stern
that
winter
he
sought
for
loneliness
for
a
to
save
his
own
trees
he
had
bought
up
a
piece
of
the
state
forest
near
by
with
some
good
timber
over
toward
the
swedish
side
and
he
did
the
felling
now
alone
refusing
all
help
sivert
was
ordered
to
stay
at
home
and
see
that
his
mother
did
not
work
too
much
and
so
in
those
short
winter
days
isak
went
out
to
his
work
in
the
dark
and
came
home
in
the
dark
it
was
not
always
there
was
a
moon
or
any
stars
and
at
times
his
own
track
of
the
morning
would
be
covered
with
snow
by
nightfall
so
he
was
hard
put
to
it
to
find
his
way
and
one
evening
something
happened
he
was
nearing
home
in
the
fine
moonlight
he
could
see
sellanraa
there
on
the
hillside
neat
and
clear
of
the
forest
but
small
undergroundish
to
look
at
by
reason
of
the
snow
banked
high
against
the
walls
he
had
more
timber
now
and
it
was
to
be
a
grand
surprise
for
inger
and
the
children
when
they
heard
what
use
he
would
make
of
it
the
wonderful
building
he
had
in
mind
he
sat
down
in
the
snow
to
rest
a
bit
not
to
seem
worn
out
when
he
came
home
all
is
quiet
around
him
and
god
blessing
on
this
quiet
and
thoughtfulness
for
it
is
nothing
but
good
isak
is
a
man
at
work
on
a
clearing
in
the
forest
and
he
looks
out
over
the
ground
reckoning
what
is
to
be
cleared
next
turn
heaving
aside
great
stones
in
his
mind
isak
had
a
real
talent
for
that
work
there
he
knows
now
is
a
deep
bare
patch
on
his
ground
it
is
full
of
ore
there
is
always
a
metallic
film
over
every
puddle
of
water
there
and
now
he
will
dig
it
out
he
marks
out
squares
with
his
eye
making
his
plans
for
all
speculating
over
all
they
are
to
be
made
green
and
fruitful
oh
but
a
piece
of
tilled
soil
was
a
great
and
good
thing
it
was
like
right
and
order
to
his
mind
and
a
delight
beyond
he
got
up
and
felt
suddenly
confused
h
what
had
happened
now
nothing
only
that
he
had
been
sitting
down
a
bit
now
there
is
something
standing
there
before
him
a
being
a
spirit
grey
silk
no
it
was
nothing
he
felt
strange
took
one
short
uncertain
step
forward
and
walked
straight
into
a
look
a
great
look
a
pair
of
eyes
at
the
same
moment
the
aspens
close
by
began
rustling
now
any
one
knows
that
an
aspen
can
have
a
horrible
eerie
way
of
rustling
at
times
anyhow
isak
had
never
before
heard
such
an
utterly
horrible
rustling
as
this
and
he
shuddered
also
he
put
out
one
hand
in
front
of
him
and
it
was
perhaps
the
most
helpless
movement
that
hand
had
ever
made
but
what
was
this
thing
before
him
was
it
or
reality
isak
would
all
his
days
have
been
ready
to
swear
that
this
was
a
higher
power
and
once
indeed
he
had
seen
it
but
the
thing
he
saw
now
did
not
look
like
god
possibly
the
holy
ghost
if
so
what
was
it
standing
there
for
anyway
in
the
midst
of
nowhere
two
eyes
a
look
and
nothing
more
if
it
had
come
to
him
to
fetch
away
his
soul
why
so
it
would
have
to
be
it
would
happen
one
day
after
all
and
then
he
would
go
to
heaven
and
be
among
the
blest
isak
was
eager
to
see
what
would
come
next
he
was
shivering
still
a
coldness
seemed
to
radiate
from
the
figure
before
him
it
must
be
the
evil
one
and
here
isak
was
no
longer
sure
of
his
ground
so
to
speak
it
might
be
the
evil
one
but
what
did
he
want
here
what
had
he
isak
been
doing
nothing
but
sitting
still
and
tilling
the
ground
as
it
were
in
his
thoughts
there
could
surely
be
no
harm
in
that
there
was
no
other
guilt
he
could
call
to
mind
just
then
he
was
only
coming
back
from
his
work
in
the
forest
a
tired
and
hungry
woodman
going
home
to
sellanraa
he
means
no
harm
he
took
a
step
forward
again
but
it
was
only
a
little
one
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
stepped
back
again
immediately
the
vision
would
not
give
way
isak
knitted
his
brows
as
if
beginning
to
suspect
something
if
it
were
the
evil
one
why
let
it
be
the
evil
one
was
not
there
was
luther
for
instance
who
had
nearly
killed
the
fiend
himself
not
to
speak
of
many
who
had
put
him
to
flight
by
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
jesu
name
not
that
isak
meant
to
defy
the
peril
before
him
it
was
not
in
his
mind
to
sit
down
and
laugh
in
its
face
but
he
certainly
gave
up
his
first
idea
of
dying
and
the
next
world
he
took
two
steps
forward
straight
at
the
vision
crossed
himself
and
cried
out
in
jesu
name
h
at
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
he
came
as
it
were
to
himself
again
and
saw
sellanraa
over
on
the
hillside
once
more
the
two
eyes
in
the
air
had
gone
he
lost
no
time
in
getting
home
and
took
no
steps
to
challenge
the
spectre
further
but
when
he
found
himself
once
more
safely
on
his
own
he
cleared
his
throat
with
a
sense
of
power
and
security
he
walked
into
the
house
with
lofty
mien
like
a
man
ay
a
man
of
the
world
inger
started
at
the
sight
of
him
and
asked
what
made
him
so
pale
and
at
that
he
did
not
deny
having
met
the
evil
one
himself
where
she
asked
over
there
right
up
towards
our
place
inger
evinced
no
jealousy
on
her
part
she
did
not
praise
him
for
it
true
but
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
suggestive
of
a
hard
word
or
a
contemptuous
kick
inger
herself
you
see
had
grown
somewhat
lighter
of
heart
and
kindlier
of
late
whatever
the
cause
and
now
she
merely
asked
the
evil
one
himself
isak
nodded
as
far
as
he
could
see
it
was
himself
and
no
other
and
how
did
you
get
rid
of
him
i
went
for
him
in
jesu
name
said
isak
inger
wagged
her
head
altogether
overwhelmed
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
get
his
supper
on
the
table
anyhow
said
she
at
last
we
have
no
more
of
you
going
out
alone
in
the
woods
by
yourself
she
was
anxious
about
him
and
it
did
him
good
to
know
it
he
made
out
to
be
as
bold
as
ever
and
altogether
careless
whether
he
went
alone
or
in
company
but
this
was
only
to
quiet
inger
mind
not
to
frighten
her
more
than
necessary
with
the
awful
thing
that
had
happened
to
himself
it
was
his
place
to
protect
her
and
them
all
he
was
the
man
the
leader
but
inger
saw
through
it
also
and
said
oh
i
know
you
do
want
to
frighten
me
but
you
must
take
sivert
with
you
all
the
same
isak
only
sniffed
you
might
be
taken
poorly
of
a
sudden
taken
ill
out
in
the
woods
you
not
been
over
well
lately
isak
sniffed
again
ill
tired
perhaps
and
worn
out
a
bit
but
ill
no
need
for
inger
to
start
worrying
and
making
a
fool
of
him
he
was
sound
and
well
enough
ate
slept
and
worked
his
health
was
simply
terrific
it
was
incurable
once
felling
a
tree
the
thing
had
come
down
on
top
of
him
and
broken
his
ear
but
he
made
light
of
it
he
set
the
ear
in
place
again
and
kept
it
there
by
wearing
his
cap
drawn
over
it
night
and
day
and
it
grew
together
again
that
way
for
internal
complaints
he
dosed
himself
with
boiled
in
milk
to
make
him
sweat
liquorice
it
was
bought
at
the
store
an
old
and
tried
remedy
the
of
the
ancients
if
he
chanced
to
cut
his
hand
he
treated
the
wound
with
an
fluid
containing
salts
and
it
healed
up
in
a
few
days
no
doctor
was
ever
sent
for
to
sellanraa
no
isak
was
not
a
meeting
with
the
evil
one
might
happen
even
to
the
healthiest
man
and
he
felt
none
the
worse
for
his
adventure
afterwards
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
have
strengthened
him
and
as
the
winter
drew
on
and
it
was
not
such
a
dreadful
time
to
wait
till
the
spring
he
the
man
and
the
leader
began
to
feel
himself
almost
a
hero
he
understood
these
things
only
trust
to
him
and
all
would
be
well
in
case
of
need
he
could
exorcise
the
evil
one
himself
altogether
the
days
were
longer
and
lighter
now
easter
was
past
isak
had
hauled
up
all
his
timber
everything
looked
bright
human
beings
could
breathe
again
after
another
winter
gone
inger
was
again
the
first
to
brighten
up
she
had
been
more
cheerful
now
for
a
long
time
what
could
it
be
ho
was
for
a
very
simple
reason
inger
was
heavy
again
expecting
a
child
again
everything
worked
out
easily
in
her
life
no
hitch
anywhere
but
what
a
mercy
after
the
way
she
had
sinned
it
was
more
than
she
had
any
right
to
expect
ay
she
was
fortunate
fortunate
isak
himself
actually
noticed
something
one
day
and
asked
her
straight
out
looks
to
me
as
if
you
on
the
way
again
what
do
you
say
yourself
ay
lord
be
thanked
is
surely
so
she
answered
they
were
both
equally
astonished
not
that
inger
was
past
the
age
of
course
to
isak
mind
she
was
not
too
old
in
any
way
but
still
another
child
well
well
and
little
leopoldine
going
to
school
several
times
a
year
down
at
breidablik
that
left
them
with
no
little
ones
about
the
place
now
besides
which
leopoldine
herself
was
grown
up
now
some
days
passed
and
isak
resolutely
threw
away
a
whole
from
saturday
evening
till
monday
morning
on
a
trip
down
to
the
village
he
would
not
say
what
he
was
going
for
when
he
set
out
but
on
his
return
he
brought
with
him
a
girl
this
is
jensine
he
said
come
to
help
is
all
your
nonsense
said
inger
i
no
need
of
help
at
all
isak
answered
that
she
did
need
a
help
just
now
need
or
not
it
was
a
kind
and
generous
thought
of
his
inger
was
abashed
and
grateful
the
new
girl
was
a
daughter
of
the
blacksmith
and
she
was
to
stay
with
them
for
the
present
through
the
summer
anyhow
and
then
they
would
see
and
i
sent
a
telegram
said
isak
after
him
eleseus
this
fairly
startled
inger
startled
the
mother
a
telegram
did
he
mean
to
upset
her
completely
with
his
thoughtfulness
it
had
been
her
great
sorrow
of
late
that
boy
eleseus
was
away
in
town
in
the
town
she
had
written
to
him
about
god
and
likewise
explained
to
him
how
his
father
here
was
beginning
to
sink
under
the
work
and
the
place
getting
bigger
all
the
time
little
sivert
could
manage
it
all
by
himself
and
besides
he
was
to
have
money
after
his
uncle
one
day
all
this
she
had
written
and
sent
him
the
money
for
his
journey
once
for
all
but
eleseus
was
a
now
and
had
no
sort
of
longing
for
a
peasant
life
he
answered
something
about
what
was
he
to
do
anyway
if
he
did
come
home
work
on
a
farm
and
throw
away
all
the
knowledge
and
learning
he
had
gained
in
point
of
fact
that
was
how
he
put
it
i
no
desire
to
come
back
now
and
if
you
could
send
me
some
stuff
for
underclothes
it
would
save
me
getting
the
things
on
credit
so
he
wrote
and
yes
his
mother
sent
him
stuff
sent
him
remarkable
quantities
of
stuff
from
time
to
time
for
underclothes
but
when
she
was
converted
and
got
religion
the
scales
fell
from
her
eyes
and
she
understood
that
eleseus
was
selling
the
stuff
and
spending
the
money
on
other
things
his
father
saw
it
too
he
never
spoke
of
it
he
knew
that
eleseus
was
his
mother
darling
and
how
she
cried
over
him
and
shook
her
head
but
one
piece
of
finely
woven
stuff
went
after
another
the
same
way
and
he
knew
it
was
more
than
any
living
man
could
use
for
underclothes
altogether
it
came
to
this
isak
must
be
man
and
leader
again
head
of
the
house
and
step
in
and
interfere
it
had
cost
a
terrible
lot
of
money
to
be
sure
getting
the
storekeeper
to
send
a
telegram
but
in
the
first
place
a
telegram
could
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
on
the
boy
and
also
it
was
something
unusually
fine
for
isak
himself
to
come
home
and
tell
inger
he
carried
the
box
on
his
back
as
he
strode
home
but
for
all
that
he
was
proud
and
full
of
weighty
secrets
as
he
had
been
the
day
he
came
home
with
that
gold
ring
it
was
a
grand
time
after
that
for
a
long
while
inger
could
not
do
enough
in
the
way
of
showing
her
husband
how
good
and
useful
she
could
be
she
would
say
to
him
now
as
in
the
old
days
you
working
yourself
to
death
or
again
is
more
than
any
man
can
stand
or
again
now
you
not
to
work
any
more
come
in
and
have
dinner
i
made
some
wafers
for
you
and
to
please
him
she
said
i
should
just
like
to
know
now
what
you
got
in
your
mind
with
all
that
wood
and
what
you
going
to
build
now
next
why
i
ca
say
as
yet
said
isak
making
a
mystery
of
it
ay
just
as
in
the
old
days
and
after
the
child
was
born
and
it
was
a
little
girl
a
great
big
girl
and
sturdy
and
sound
after
that
isak
must
have
been
a
stone
and
a
miserable
creature
if
he
had
not
thanked
god
but
what
was
he
going
to
build
it
would
be
more
news
for
oline
to
go
gadding
about
with
a
new
building
again
at
sellanraa
a
new
wing
of
the
house
a
new
house
it
was
to
be
and
there
were
so
many
now
at
sellanraa
they
had
a
and
eleseus
he
was
coming
home
and
a
little
of
their
own
just
come
the
old
house
would
be
just
an
extra
room
now
nothing
more
and
of
course
he
had
to
tell
inger
about
it
one
day
she
was
so
curious
to
know
and
though
maybe
inger
knew
it
all
beforehand
from
sivert
they
two
were
often
whispering
together
she
was
all
surprised
as
any
one
could
be
and
let
her
arms
fall
and
said
is
all
your
nonsense
you
do
mean
it
and
isak
brimming
over
with
greatness
inside
he
answered
her
why
with
you
bringing
i
do
know
how
many
more
children
on
the
place
the
least
i
can
do
it
seems
the
two
menfolk
were
out
now
every
day
getting
stone
for
the
walls
of
the
new
house
they
worked
their
utmost
together
each
in
his
own
way
the
one
young
and
with
his
young
body
firmly
set
quick
to
see
his
way
to
mark
out
the
stones
that
would
suit
the
other
ageing
tough
with
long
arms
and
a
mighty
weight
to
bear
down
on
a
crowbar
when
they
had
managed
some
specially
difficult
feat
they
would
hold
a
and
talk
together
in
a
curious
reserved
fashion
of
their
own
brede
he
talks
of
selling
out
said
the
father
ay
said
the
son
wonder
what
he
be
asking
for
the
place
ay
i
wonder
you
not
heard
anything
no
i
heard
two
hundred
the
father
thought
for
a
while
and
said
what
think
this
be
a
good
stone
all
depends
if
we
can
get
this
shell
off
him
said
sivert
and
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
giving
the
to
his
father
and
taking
the
sledge
himself
he
grew
red
and
hot
stood
up
to
his
full
height
and
let
the
fall
rose
again
and
let
it
fall
twenty
strokes
alike
twenty
he
spared
neither
tool
nor
strength
it
was
heavy
work
his
shirt
rucked
up
from
his
trousers
at
the
waist
leaving
him
bare
in
front
he
lifted
on
his
toes
each
time
to
give
the
sledge
a
better
swing
twenty
strokes
now
let
look
cried
his
father
the
son
stops
and
asks
marked
him
any
and
they
lay
down
together
to
look
at
the
stone
look
at
the
beast
the
devil
of
a
thing
no
not
marked
any
as
yet
i
a
mind
to
try
with
the
sledge
alone
said
the
father
and
stood
up
still
harder
work
this
sheer
force
alone
the
hammer
grew
hot
the
steel
crushed
the
pen
grew
blunt
she
be
slipping
the
head
he
said
and
stopped
and
i
no
hand
at
this
any
more
he
said
oh
but
he
never
meant
it
it
was
not
his
thought
that
he
was
no
hand
at
the
work
any
more
this
father
this
barge
of
a
man
simple
full
of
patience
and
goodness
he
would
let
his
son
strike
the
last
few
blows
and
cleave
the
stone
and
there
it
lay
split
in
two
ay
you
the
trick
of
it
said
the
father
h
yes
breidablik
might
make
something
but
of
that
place
ay
should
think
so
said
the
son
only
the
land
was
fairly
ditched
and
turned
the
house
have
to
be
done
up
ay
that
of
course
place
all
done
up
mean
a
lot
of
work
at
first
but
what
i
was
going
to
say
know
if
your
mother
was
going
to
church
come
sunday
ay
she
said
something
like
it
ho
h
keep
your
eyes
open
now
and
look
out
for
a
good
big
for
the
new
house
you
have
seen
a
bit
would
do
no
said
sivert
and
they
fell
to
work
again
a
couple
of
days
later
both
agreed
they
had
enough
stone
now
for
the
walls
it
was
friday
evening
they
sat
taking
a
and
talking
together
the
while
h
what
say
said
the
father
should
we
think
it
over
maybe
about
breidablik
how
mean
asked
the
son
what
to
do
with
it
why
i
do
know
there
the
school
there
and
it
midway
down
this
tract
now
and
what
then
asked
the
son
i
do
know
what
we
do
with
it
though
it
not
worth
much
as
it
is
that
what
you
been
thinking
of
no
not
that
way
unless
eleseus
he
like
to
have
the
place
to
work
on
eleseus
well
no
i
do
know
long
pause
the
two
men
thinking
hard
the
father
begins
gathering
tools
together
packing
up
to
go
home
ay
unless
said
sivert
you
might
ask
him
what
he
says
the
father
made
an
end
of
the
matter
thus
well
there
another
day
and
we
have
found
that
yet
either
next
day
was
saturday
and
they
had
to
be
off
early
to
get
across
the
hills
with
the
child
jensine
the
was
to
go
with
them
that
was
one
godmother
the
rest
they
would
have
to
find
from
among
inger
folk
on
the
other
side
inger
looked
nice
she
had
made
herself
a
dainty
cotton
dress
with
white
at
the
neck
and
wrists
the
child
was
all
in
white
with
a
new
blue
silk
ribbon
drawn
through
the
lower
edge
of
its
dress
but
then
she
was
a
wonder
of
a
child
to
be
sure
that
could
smile
and
chatter
already
and
lay
and
listened
when
the
clock
struck
on
the
wall
her
father
had
chosen
her
name
it
was
his
right
he
was
determined
to
have
his
say
only
trust
to
him
he
had
hesitated
between
jacobine
and
rebecca
as
being
both
sort
of
related
to
isak
and
at
last
he
went
to
inger
and
asked
timidly
what
think
now
of
rebecca
why
yes
said
inger
and
when
isak
heard
that
he
grew
suddenly
independent
and
master
in
his
own
house
if
she
to
have
a
name
at
all
he
said
sharply
it
shall
be
rebecca
i
see
to
that
and
of
course
he
was
going
with
the
party
to
church
partly
to
carry
and
partly
for
propriety
sake
it
would
never
do
to
let
rebecca
go
to
be
christened
without
a
decent
following
isak
trimmed
his
beard
and
put
on
a
red
shirt
as
in
his
younger
days
it
was
in
the
worst
of
the
hot
weather
but
he
had
a
nice
new
winter
suit
that
looked
well
on
him
and
he
wore
it
but
for
all
that
isak
was
not
the
man
to
make
a
duty
of
finery
and
show
as
now
for
instance
he
put
on
a
pair
of
fabulously
heavy
boots
for
the
march
sivert
and
leopoldine
stayed
behind
to
look
after
the
place
then
they
rowed
in
a
boat
across
the
lake
and
that
was
a
deal
easier
than
before
when
they
had
had
to
walk
round
all
the
way
but
across
as
inger
unfastened
her
dress
to
nurse
the
child
isak
noticed
something
bright
hung
in
a
string
round
her
neck
whatever
it
might
be
and
in
the
church
he
noticed
that
she
wore
that
gold
ring
on
her
finger
oh
inger
it
had
been
too
much
for
her
after
all
chapter
xvii
eleseus
came
home
he
had
been
away
now
for
some
years
and
had
grown
taller
than
his
father
with
long
white
hands
and
a
little
dark
growth
on
his
upper
lip
he
did
not
give
himself
airs
but
seemed
anxious
to
appear
natural
and
kindly
his
mother
was
surprised
and
pleased
he
shared
the
small
bedroom
with
sivert
the
two
brothers
got
on
well
together
and
were
constantly
playing
tricks
on
each
other
by
way
of
amusement
but
naturally
eleseus
had
to
take
his
share
of
the
work
in
building
the
house
and
tired
and
miserable
it
made
him
all
unused
as
he
was
to
bodily
fatigue
of
any
kind
it
was
worse
still
when
sivert
had
to
go
off
and
leave
it
all
to
the
other
two
eleseus
then
was
almost
more
of
a
hindrance
than
a
help
and
where
had
sivert
gone
off
to
why
was
oline
had
come
over
the
hills
one
day
with
word
from
uncle
sivert
that
he
was
dying
and
of
course
young
sivert
had
to
go
a
nice
state
of
things
all
at
once
it
could
have
happened
worse
than
to
have
sivert
running
off
just
now
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
said
oline
i
no
time
to
go
running
errands
and
that
the
truth
but
for
all
that
i
taken
a
fancy
to
the
children
here
all
of
them
and
little
sivert
and
if
as
i
could
help
him
to
his
legacy
but
was
uncle
sivert
very
bad
then
bad
heaven
bless
us
he
falling
away
day
by
day
was
he
in
bed
then
in
bed
how
can
you
talk
so
light
and
flighty
of
death
before
nay
he
neither
hop
nor
run
again
in
this
world
will
your
uncle
sivert
all
this
seemed
to
mean
that
uncle
sivert
had
not
long
to
live
and
inger
insisted
that
little
sivert
should
set
off
at
once
but
uncle
sivert
incorrigible
old
knave
was
not
on
his
was
not
even
confined
to
bed
at
all
when
young
sivert
came
he
found
the
little
place
in
terrible
muddle
and
disorder
they
had
not
finished
the
spring
season
work
properly
yet
had
not
even
carted
out
all
the
winter
manure
but
as
for
approaching
death
there
was
no
sign
of
it
that
he
could
see
uncle
sivert
was
an
old
man
now
over
seventy
he
was
something
of
an
invalid
and
pottered
about
in
the
house
and
often
kept
his
bed
for
a
time
he
needed
help
on
the
place
in
many
ways
as
for
instance
with
the
herring
nets
that
hung
rotting
in
the
sheds
oh
but
for
all
that
he
was
by
no
means
at
his
last
gasp
he
could
still
eat
sour
fish
and
smoke
his
pipe
when
sivert
had
been
there
half
an
hour
and
seen
how
things
were
he
was
for
going
back
home
again
home
said
the
old
man
we
building
a
house
and
father
none
to
help
him
properly
ho
said
his
uncle
is
eleseus
come
home
then
ay
but
he
not
used
to
the
work
then
why
did
you
come
at
all
sivert
told
him
about
oline
and
her
message
how
she
had
said
that
uncle
sivert
was
on
the
point
of
death
point
of
death
cried
the
old
man
said
i
was
on
the
point
of
death
did
she
a
cursed
old
fool
ha
ha
ha
said
sivert
the
old
man
looked
sternly
at
him
eh
laugh
at
a
dying
man
do
you
and
you
called
after
me
and
all
but
sivert
was
too
young
to
put
on
a
graveyard
face
for
that
he
had
never
cared
much
for
his
uncle
and
now
he
wanted
to
get
back
home
again
ho
so
you
thought
so
too
said
the
old
man
again
thought
i
was
at
my
last
gasp
and
that
fetched
you
did
it
was
oline
said
so
answered
sivert
his
uncle
was
silent
for
a
while
then
spoke
again
look
you
here
if
you
mend
that
net
of
mine
and
put
it
right
i
show
you
something
h
said
sivert
what
is
it
well
never
you
mind
said
the
old
man
sullenly
and
went
to
bed
again
it
was
going
to
be
a
long
business
evidently
sivert
writhed
uncomfortably
he
went
out
and
took
a
look
round
the
place
everything
was
shamefully
neglected
and
uncared
for
it
was
hopeless
to
begin
work
here
when
he
came
in
after
a
while
his
uncle
was
sitting
up
warming
himself
at
the
stove
see
that
he
pointed
to
an
oak
chest
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
it
was
his
money
chest
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
a
lined
case
made
to
hold
bottles
such
as
visiting
justices
and
other
great
folk
used
to
carry
with
them
when
travelling
about
the
country
in
the
old
days
but
there
were
no
bottles
in
it
now
the
old
man
had
used
it
for
his
documents
and
papers
as
district
treasurer
he
kept
his
accounts
and
his
money
in
it
now
the
story
ran
that
it
was
full
of
uncounted
riches
the
village
folk
would
shake
their
heads
and
say
ah
if
only
as
much
as
lies
in
old
sivert
his
chest
uncle
sivert
took
out
a
paper
from
the
box
and
said
solemnly
you
can
read
writing
i
suppose
little
sivert
was
not
by
any
means
a
great
hand
at
that
it
is
true
but
he
made
out
so
much
as
told
him
he
was
to
inherit
all
that
his
uncle
might
leave
at
his
death
there
said
the
old
man
and
now
you
can
do
as
you
please
and
he
laid
the
paper
back
in
the
chest
sivert
was
not
greatly
impressed
after
all
the
paper
told
him
no
more
than
he
had
known
before
ever
since
he
was
a
child
he
had
heard
say
that
he
was
to
have
what
uncle
sivert
left
one
day
a
sight
of
the
treasure
would
be
another
matter
there
some
fine
things
in
that
chest
i
doubt
said
he
there
more
than
you
think
said
the
old
man
shortly
he
was
angry
and
disappointed
with
his
nephew
he
locked
up
the
box
and
went
to
bed
again
there
he
lay
delivering
jets
of
information
i
been
district
treasurer
and
warden
of
the
public
moneys
in
this
village
over
thirty
year
no
need
to
beg
and
pray
for
a
helping
hand
from
any
man
who
told
oline
i
like
to
know
that
i
was
on
my
deathbed
i
can
send
three
men
carriage
and
cart
to
fetch
a
doctor
if
i
want
one
do
try
your
games
with
me
young
man
ca
even
wait
till
i
gone
it
seems
i
shown
you
the
document
and
you
seen
it
and
it
there
in
the
chest
that
all
i
got
to
say
but
if
you
go
running
off
and
leave
me
now
you
can
just
carry
word
to
eleseus
and
tell
to
come
he
not
named
after
me
and
called
by
my
earthly
name
let
come
but
for
all
the
threatening
tone
sivert
only
thought
a
moment
and
said
ay
i
tell
eleseus
to
come
oline
was
still
at
sellanraa
when
sivert
got
back
she
had
found
time
to
pay
a
visit
lower
down
to
axel
str√∂m
and
barbro
on
their
place
and
came
back
full
of
mysteries
and
whisperings
that
girl
filling
out
a
deal
of
late
lord
knows
what
it
may
mean
but
not
a
word
that
i
said
so
and
here
sivert
back
again
no
need
to
ask
what
news
i
suppose
your
uncle
sivert
passed
away
ay
well
an
old
man
he
was
and
an
aged
one
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
what
not
dead
well
well
we
much
to
be
thankful
for
and
that
a
solemn
word
me
talking
nonsense
you
say
oh
if
i
never
more
to
answer
for
how
was
i
to
know
your
uncle
he
was
lying
there
a
sham
and
a
false
pretender
before
the
lord
not
long
to
live
that
what
i
said
and
i
hold
by
it
when
the
time
comes
before
the
throne
that
you
say
well
and
was
he
lying
there
his
very
self
in
his
bed
and
folding
his
hands
on
his
breast
and
saying
soon
be
over
there
was
no
arguing
with
oline
she
bewildered
her
adversaries
with
talk
and
cast
them
down
when
she
learned
that
uncle
sivert
had
sent
for
eleseus
she
grasped
at
that
too
and
made
her
own
advantage
of
it
there
you
are
and
see
if
i
was
talking
nonsense
here
old
sivert
calling
up
his
kinsfolk
and
longing
for
a
sight
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
ay
he
nearing
his
end
you
ca
refuse
him
eleseus
off
with
you
at
once
this
minute
and
see
your
uncle
while
there
life
in
him
i
going
that
way
too
we
go
together
oline
did
not
leave
sellanraa
without
taking
inger
aside
for
more
whisperings
of
barbro
not
a
word
i
said
but
i
could
see
the
signs
of
it
and
now
i
suppose
she
be
wife
and
all
on
the
farm
there
ay
there
some
folk
are
born
to
great
things
for
all
they
may
be
small
as
the
sands
of
the
sea
in
their
beginnings
and
have
ever
thought
it
of
that
girl
barbro
axel
yes
never
doubt
but
he
a
toiling
sort
and
getting
on
and
great
fine
lands
and
means
and
all
like
you
got
here
is
more
than
we
know
of
over
on
our
side
the
hills
as
you
know
a
true
word
inger
being
born
and
come
of
the
place
yourself
barbro
she
a
trifle
of
wool
in
a
chest
was
naught
but
winter
wool
and
i
was
asking
and
she
never
offered
me
we
said
but
and
for
all
that
i
known
her
from
she
was
a
toddling
child
all
that
time
i
was
here
at
sellanraa
by
reason
of
you
being
away
and
learning
knowledge
at
the
institute
there
rebecca
crying
said
inger
breaking
in
on
oline
but
she
gave
her
a
handful
of
wool
then
a
great
thanksgiving
speech
from
oline
ay
was
it
just
as
she
had
said
to
barbro
herself
of
inger
and
how
there
was
not
her
like
to
be
found
for
giving
to
folk
ay
she
give
till
she
was
bare
and
give
her
fingers
to
the
bone
and
never
complain
ay
go
in
and
see
to
the
sweet
angel
and
never
was
there
a
child
in
the
world
so
like
her
mother
as
rebecca
no
did
inger
remember
how
she
said
one
day
as
she
never
have
children
again
ah
now
she
could
see
no
better
give
ear
to
them
as
were
grown
old
and
had
borne
children
of
their
own
for
who
should
fathom
the
lord
his
ways
said
oline
and
with
that
she
padded
off
after
eleseus
up
through
the
forest
shrunken
with
age
grey
and
abject
and
for
ever
nosing
after
things
imperishable
going
to
old
sivert
now
to
let
him
know
how
she
oline
had
managed
to
persuade
eleseus
to
come
but
eleseus
had
needed
no
persuading
there
was
no
difficulty
there
for
look
you
eleseus
had
turned
out
better
after
all
than
begun
a
decent
lad
in
his
way
kindly
and
from
a
child
only
nothing
great
in
the
way
of
bodily
strength
it
was
not
without
reason
he
had
been
unwilling
to
come
home
this
time
he
knew
well
enough
that
his
mother
had
been
in
prison
for
he
had
never
heard
a
word
about
it
there
in
the
town
but
at
home
in
the
village
every
one
would
remember
and
it
was
not
for
nothing
he
had
been
living
with
companions
of
another
sort
he
had
grown
to
be
more
sensitive
and
finer
feeling
than
ever
before
he
knew
that
a
fork
was
really
just
as
necessary
as
a
knife
as
a
man
of
business
he
used
the
terms
of
the
new
coinage
whereas
out
in
the
wilds
men
still
counted
money
by
the
ancient
ay
he
was
not
unwilling
to
walk
across
the
hills
to
other
parts
here
at
home
he
was
constantly
forced
to
keep
down
his
own
superiority
he
tried
his
best
to
adapt
himself
to
the
others
and
he
managed
well
but
it
was
always
having
to
be
on
his
guard
as
for
instance
when
he
had
first
come
back
to
sellanraa
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
he
had
brought
with
him
his
light
spring
overcoat
though
it
was
midsummer
and
when
he
hung
it
up
on
a
nail
he
might
just
as
well
have
turned
it
so
as
to
show
the
silver
plate
inside
with
his
initials
but
he
did
and
the
same
with
his
stick
his
true
it
was
only
an
umbrella
stick
really
that
he
had
dismantled
and
taken
the
framework
off
but
here
he
had
not
used
it
as
he
did
in
town
swinging
it
about
only
carried
it
hidden
against
his
thigh
no
it
was
not
surprising
that
eleseus
went
across
the
hills
he
was
no
good
at
building
houses
he
was
good
at
writing
with
letters
a
thing
not
every
one
could
do
but
here
at
home
there
was
no
one
in
all
the
place
that
set
any
store
by
the
art
of
it
save
perhaps
his
mother
he
set
off
gaily
through
the
woods
far
ahead
of
oline
he
could
wait
for
her
farther
up
he
ran
like
a
calf
he
hurried
eleseus
had
in
a
way
stolen
off
from
the
farm
he
was
afraid
of
being
seen
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
taken
with
him
both
spring
coat
and
for
the
journey
over
on
the
other
side
there
might
be
a
chance
of
seeing
people
and
being
seen
himself
he
might
even
be
able
to
go
to
church
and
so
he
sweated
happily
under
the
weight
of
an
unnecessary
spring
coat
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
they
did
not
miss
him
at
the
building
far
from
it
isak
had
sivert
back
again
and
sivert
was
worth
a
host
of
his
brother
at
that
work
he
could
keep
at
it
from
morning
to
night
it
did
not
take
them
long
to
get
the
framework
up
it
was
only
three
walls
as
they
were
building
out
from
the
other
and
they
had
less
trouble
with
the
timber
they
could
cut
their
planks
at
the
sawmill
which
gave
them
the
outside
pieces
for
roofing
at
the
same
time
and
one
fine
day
there
was
the
house
all
finished
before
their
eyes
roofed
floored
and
with
the
windows
in
they
had
no
time
for
more
than
this
between
the
seasons
the
boarding
and
painting
would
have
to
wait
and
now
came
geissler
with
a
great
following
across
the
hills
from
sweden
and
the
men
with
him
rode
on
horseback
with
horses
and
yellow
saddles
rich
travellers
they
must
be
no
doubt
stout
heavy
men
the
horses
bowed
under
their
weight
and
among
all
these
great
personages
came
geissler
on
foot
four
gentlemen
and
geissler
made
up
the
party
and
then
there
were
a
couple
of
servants
each
leading
a
packhorse
the
riders
dismounted
outside
the
farm
and
geissler
said
isak
here
the
margrave
of
the
place
himself
isak
come
back
again
you
see
as
i
said
i
would
geissler
was
the
same
as
ever
for
all
that
he
came
on
foot
his
manner
showed
no
consciousness
of
inferiority
to
the
rest
ay
his
threadbare
coat
hung
long
and
down
over
his
shrunken
back
but
he
put
on
a
grand
enough
air
for
all
that
he
even
said
we
going
up
into
the
hills
a
bit
these
gentlemen
and
myself
it
do
them
good
to
get
their
weight
down
a
bit
the
gentlemen
themselves
were
nice
and
pleasant
enough
they
smiled
at
geissler
words
and
hoped
isak
would
excuse
their
coming
rioting
over
his
land
like
this
they
had
brought
their
own
provisions
and
did
not
propose
to
eat
him
out
of
house
and
home
but
they
would
be
glad
of
a
roof
over
their
heads
for
the
night
perhaps
he
could
put
them
up
in
the
new
building
there
when
they
had
rested
a
while
and
geissler
had
been
inside
with
inger
and
the
children
the
whole
party
went
up
into
the
hills
and
stayed
out
till
evening
now
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
the
folks
at
sellanraa
could
hear
an
unusually
heavy
report
from
the
distance
and
the
train
of
them
came
down
with
new
bags
of
samples
blue
copper
they
said
nodding
at
the
ore
they
talked
long
and
learnedly
and
consulting
a
sort
of
map
they
had
drawn
there
was
an
engineer
among
them
and
a
mining
expert
one
appeared
to
be
a
big
landowner
or
manager
of
works
they
talked
of
aerial
railways
and
cable
traction
geissler
threw
in
a
word
here
and
there
and
each
time
as
if
advising
them
they
paid
great
attention
to
what
he
said
who
owns
the
land
south
of
the
lake
one
of
them
asked
isak
the
state
answered
geissler
quickly
he
was
wide
awake
and
sharp
and
held
in
his
hand
the
document
isak
had
once
signed
with
his
mark
i
told
you
before
the
state
he
said
no
need
to
ask
again
if
you
do
believe
me
you
can
find
out
for
yourself
if
you
please
later
in
the
evening
geissler
took
isak
aside
and
said
look
here
shall
we
sell
that
copper
mine
said
isak
why
as
to
that
was
so
that
lensmand
bought
it
of
me
once
and
paid
for
it
true
said
geissler
i
bought
the
ground
but
then
there
was
a
provision
that
you
were
to
have
a
percentage
of
receipts
from
working
or
sale
are
you
willing
to
dispose
of
your
share
this
was
more
than
isak
could
understand
and
geissler
had
to
explain
isak
could
not
work
a
mine
being
a
farmer
and
a
clearer
of
forest
land
geissler
himself
could
run
a
mine
either
money
capital
ho
as
much
as
he
wanted
never
fear
but
he
had
the
time
too
many
things
to
do
always
running
about
the
country
attending
to
his
property
in
the
south
his
property
in
the
north
and
now
geissler
was
thinking
of
selling
out
to
these
swedish
gentlemen
here
they
were
relatives
of
his
wife
all
of
them
and
rich
men
do
you
see
what
i
mean
i
do
it
what
way
you
please
said
isak
a
strange
thing
this
complete
confidence
seemed
to
comfort
geissler
wonderfully
in
his
threadbareness
well
i
not
sure
it
the
best
thing
you
could
do
he
said
thoughtfully
then
suddenly
he
was
certain
and
went
on
but
if
you
give
me
a
free
hand
to
act
on
my
discretion
i
can
do
better
for
you
at
any
rate
than
you
could
by
yourself
h
began
isak
you
always
been
a
good
man
to
us
all
here
but
geissler
frowned
at
that
and
cut
him
short
all
right
then
next
morning
the
gentlemen
sat
down
to
write
it
was
a
serious
business
there
was
first
of
all
a
contract
for
forty
thousand
for
the
sale
of
the
mine
then
a
document
whereby
geissler
made
over
the
whole
of
the
money
to
his
wife
and
children
isak
and
sivert
were
called
in
to
witness
the
signatures
to
these
when
it
was
done
the
gentlemen
wanted
to
buy
over
isak
percentage
for
a
ridiculous
sum
five
hundred
geissler
put
a
stop
to
that
however
jesting
apart
he
said
isak
himself
understood
but
little
of
the
whole
affair
he
had
sold
the
place
once
and
got
his
money
but
in
any
case
he
did
not
care
much
about
it
was
not
real
money
like
sivert
on
the
other
hand
followed
the
business
with
more
understanding
there
was
something
peculiar
he
thought
about
the
tone
of
these
negotiations
it
looked
very
much
like
a
family
affair
between
the
parties
one
of
the
strangers
would
say
my
dear
geissler
you
ought
not
to
have
such
red
eyes
you
know
whereto
geissler
answered
sharply
if
evasively
no
i
ought
not
i
know
but
we
do
all
get
what
we
ought
to
in
this
world
it
looked
very
much
as
if
fru
geissler
brothers
and
kinsmen
were
trying
to
buy
off
her
husband
secure
themselves
against
his
visits
for
the
future
and
get
quit
of
a
troublesome
relation
as
to
the
mine
it
was
worth
something
in
itself
no
doubt
no
one
denied
it
but
it
lay
far
out
of
the
way
and
the
buyers
themselves
said
they
were
only
taking
it
over
in
order
to
sell
it
again
to
some
one
better
in
a
position
to
work
it
there
was
nothing
unreasonable
in
that
they
declared
too
quite
frankly
that
they
had
no
idea
what
they
would
be
able
to
get
for
it
as
it
stood
if
it
were
taken
up
and
worked
then
the
forty
thousand
might
turn
out
to
be
only
a
fraction
of
what
it
was
worth
if
it
were
allowed
to
lie
there
as
it
was
the
money
was
simply
thrown
away
but
in
any
case
they
wanted
to
have
a
clear
title
without
encumbrance
and
therefore
they
offered
isak
five
hundred
for
his
share
i
acting
on
his
behalf
said
geissler
and
i
not
going
to
sell
out
his
share
for
less
than
ten
per
cent
of
the
four
thousand
said
the
others
four
thousand
said
geissler
the
land
was
his
and
his
share
comes
to
four
thousand
it
was
mine
and
i
get
forty
thousand
kindly
turn
that
over
in
your
minds
if
you
please
yes
but
four
thousand
geissler
rose
from
his
place
and
said
that
or
no
sale
they
thought
it
over
whispered
about
it
went
out
into
the
yard
talking
as
long
as
they
could
get
the
horses
ready
they
called
to
the
servants
one
of
the
gentlemen
went
in
to
inger
and
paid
royally
for
coffee
a
few
eggs
and
their
lodging
geissler
walked
about
with
a
careless
air
but
he
was
wide
awake
all
the
same
how
did
that
irrigation
work
turn
out
last
year
he
asked
sivert
it
saved
the
whole
crop
you
cut
away
that
mound
there
since
i
was
here
last
what
ay
you
must
have
another
horse
on
the
farm
said
geissler
he
noticed
everything
one
of
the
strangers
came
up
now
then
let
get
this
matter
settled
and
have
done
with
it
he
said
they
all
went
into
the
new
building
again
and
isak
four
thousand
were
counted
out
geissler
was
given
a
paper
which
he
thrust
into
his
pocket
as
if
it
were
of
no
value
at
all
keep
that
carefully
they
told
him
and
in
a
few
days
your
wife
shall
have
the
bankbook
sent
geissler
puckered
his
forehead
and
said
shortly
very
good
but
they
were
not
finished
with
geissler
yet
not
that
he
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
for
anything
he
simply
stood
there
and
they
saw
how
he
stood
there
maybe
he
had
stipulated
beforehand
for
a
trifle
on
his
own
account
the
leader
gave
him
a
bundle
of
notes
and
geissler
simply
nodded
again
and
said
very
good
and
now
i
think
we
ought
to
drink
a
glass
with
geissler
said
the
other
they
drank
and
that
was
done
and
then
they
took
leave
of
geissler
just
at
that
moment
came
brede
olsen
walking
up
now
what
did
he
want
brede
had
doubtless
heard
the
reports
of
the
blasting
charges
the
day
before
and
understood
that
there
was
something
on
foot
in
the
way
of
mines
and
now
he
came
up
ready
to
sell
something
too
he
walked
straight
past
geissler
and
addressed
himself
to
the
gentlemen
he
had
found
some
remarkable
specimens
of
rock
hereabouts
quite
extraordinary
some
others
like
silver
he
knew
every
cranny
and
corner
in
the
hills
around
and
could
go
straight
to
every
spot
he
knew
of
long
veins
of
some
heavy
metal
whatever
it
might
be
have
you
any
samples
asked
the
mining
expert
yes
brede
had
samples
but
could
they
just
as
well
go
up
and
look
at
the
places
at
once
it
was
far
samples
oh
sacks
of
them
whole
full
no
he
had
not
brought
them
with
him
they
were
at
home
he
could
run
down
and
fetch
them
but
it
would
be
quicker
just
to
run
up
into
the
hills
and
fetch
some
more
if
they
would
only
wait
the
men
shook
their
heads
and
went
on
their
way
brede
looked
after
them
with
an
injured
air
if
he
had
felt
a
glimmer
of
hope
for
the
moment
it
was
gone
now
fate
was
against
him
nothing
ever
went
right
well
for
brede
that
he
was
not
easily
cast
down
he
looked
after
the
men
as
they
rode
away
and
said
at
last
wish
you
a
pleasant
journey
and
that
was
all
but
now
he
was
humble
again
in
his
manner
towards
geissler
his
former
chief
and
no
longer
treated
him
as
an
equal
but
used
forms
of
respect
geissler
had
taken
out
his
on
some
pretext
or
other
and
any
one
could
see
that
it
was
stuffed
full
of
notes
if
only
lensmand
could
help
me
a
bit
said
brede
go
back
home
and
work
your
land
properly
said
geissler
and
helped
him
not
a
bit
i
might
easily
have
brought
up
a
whole
of
samples
but
would
it
have
been
easier
to
go
up
and
look
at
the
place
itself
while
they
were
here
geissler
took
no
notice
of
him
and
turned
to
isak
did
you
see
what
i
did
with
that
document
it
was
a
most
important
thing
a
matter
of
several
thousand
oh
here
it
is
in
among
a
bundle
of
notes
who
were
those
people
asked
brede
just
out
for
a
ride
or
what
geissler
had
been
having
an
anxious
time
no
doubt
and
now
he
cooled
down
but
he
had
still
something
of
life
and
eagerness
in
him
enough
to
do
a
little
more
he
went
up
into
the
hills
with
sivert
and
took
a
big
sheet
of
paper
with
him
and
drew
a
map
of
the
ground
south
of
the
lake
heaven
knows
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
came
down
to
the
farm
some
hours
later
brede
was
still
there
but
geissler
took
no
notice
of
his
questions
geissler
was
tired
and
waved
him
aside
he
slept
like
a
stone
till
next
morning
early
then
he
rose
with
the
sun
and
was
himself
again
sellanraa
said
he
standing
outside
and
looking
all
round
all
that
money
said
isak
does
it
mean
i
to
have
it
all
all
said
geissler
heavens
man
ca
you
see
it
ought
to
have
been
ever
so
much
more
and
it
was
my
business
really
to
pay
you
according
to
our
contract
but
you
saw
how
things
were
it
was
the
only
way
to
manage
it
what
did
you
get
only
a
thousand
according
to
the
old
reckoning
i
been
thinking
you
need
another
horse
on
the
place
now
ay
well
i
know
of
one
that
fellow
heyerdahl
assistant
he
letting
his
place
go
to
rack
and
ruin
takes
more
interest
in
running
about
selling
folk
up
he
sold
a
deal
of
his
stock
already
and
he
be
willing
to
sell
the
horse
i
see
him
about
it
said
isak
geissler
waved
his
hand
broadly
around
and
said
margrave
landowner
that
you
house
and
stock
and
cultivated
land
they
starve
you
out
if
they
try
no
said
isak
we
all
we
could
wish
for
that
the
lord
ever
made
geissler
went
fussing
about
the
place
and
suddenly
slipped
in
to
inger
could
you
manage
a
bit
of
food
for
me
to
take
along
again
he
asked
just
a
few
wafers
no
butter
and
cheese
there
good
things
enough
in
them
already
no
do
as
i
say
i
ca
carry
more
out
again
geissler
was
restless
he
went
into
the
new
building
and
sat
down
to
write
he
had
thought
it
all
out
beforehand
and
it
did
not
take
long
now
to
get
it
down
sending
in
an
application
to
the
state
he
explained
loftily
to
isak
to
the
ministry
of
the
interior
you
understand
yes
i
no
end
of
things
to
look
after
all
at
once
when
he
had
got
his
parcel
of
food
and
had
taken
leave
he
seemed
to
remember
something
all
of
a
sudden
oh
by
the
way
i
afraid
i
owe
you
something
from
last
time
i
took
out
a
note
from
my
on
purpose
and
then
stuck
it
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
i
found
it
there
afterwards
too
many
things
to
think
about
all
at
once
he
put
something
into
inger
hand
and
off
he
went
ay
off
went
geissler
bravely
enough
to
all
seeming
nothing
downcast
nor
anyway
nearing
his
end
he
came
to
sellanraa
again
after
and
it
was
long
years
before
he
died
each
time
he
went
away
the
sellanraa
folk
missed
him
as
a
friend
isak
had
been
thinking
of
asking
him
about
breidablik
getting
his
advice
but
nothing
came
of
it
and
maybe
geissler
would
have
dissuaded
him
there
have
thought
it
a
risky
thing
to
buy
up
land
for
cultivation
and
give
it
to
eleseus
to
a
clerk
chapter
xviii
uncle
sivert
died
after
all
eleseus
spent
three
weeks
looking
after
him
and
then
the
old
man
died
eleseus
arranged
the
funeral
and
managed
things
very
well
got
hold
of
a
fuchsia
or
so
from
the
cottages
round
and
borrowed
a
flag
to
hoist
at
and
bought
some
black
stuff
from
the
store
for
lowered
blinds
isak
and
inger
were
sent
for
and
came
to
the
burial
eleseus
acted
as
host
and
served
out
refreshments
to
the
guests
ay
and
when
the
body
was
carried
out
and
they
had
sung
a
hymn
eleseus
actually
said
a
few
suitable
words
over
the
coffin
and
his
mother
was
so
proud
and
touched
that
she
had
to
use
her
handkerchief
everything
went
off
splendidly
then
on
the
way
home
with
his
father
eleseus
had
to
carry
that
spring
coat
of
his
openly
though
he
managed
to
hide
the
stick
in
one
of
the
sleeves
all
went
well
till
they
had
to
cross
the
water
in
a
boat
then
his
father
sat
down
unexpectedly
on
the
coat
and
there
was
a
crack
what
was
that
asked
isak
oh
nothing
said
eleseus
but
he
did
not
throw
the
broken
stick
away
as
soon
as
they
got
home
he
set
about
looking
for
a
bit
of
tube
or
something
to
mend
it
with
we
fix
it
all
right
said
sivert
the
incorrigible
look
here
get
a
good
stout
splint
of
wood
on
either
side
and
lash
all
fast
with
waxed
thread
i
lash
you
with
waxed
thread
said
eleseus
ha
ha
ha
well
perhaps
you
rather
tie
it
up
neatly
with
a
red
garter
ha
ha
ha
said
eleseus
himself
at
that
but
he
went
in
to
his
mother
and
got
her
to
give
him
an
old
thimble
filed
off
the
end
and
made
quite
a
fine
ferrule
oh
eleseus
was
not
so
helpless
after
all
with
his
long
white
hands
the
brothers
teased
each
other
as
much
as
ever
am
i
to
have
what
uncle
sivert
left
asked
eleseus
you
have
it
how
much
is
it
asked
sivert
ha
ha
ha
you
want
to
know
how
much
it
is
first
you
old
miser
well
you
can
have
it
anyway
said
sivert
it
between
five
and
ten
thousand
cried
sivert
he
could
help
it
now
eleseus
never
reckoned
in
but
he
did
like
to
say
no
at
the
time
so
he
just
nodded
and
left
it
at
that
till
next
day
then
he
took
up
the
matter
again
are
you
sorry
you
gave
me
all
that
yesterday
he
said
woodenhead
of
course
not
said
sivert
that
was
what
he
said
but
well
five
thousand
was
five
thousand
and
no
little
sum
if
his
brother
were
anything
but
a
lousy
indian
savage
he
ought
to
give
back
half
well
to
tell
the
truth
explained
eleseus
i
do
reckon
to
get
fat
on
that
legacy
after
all
sivert
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
ho
do
you
no
nothing
special
that
is
to
say
not
what
you
might
call
eleseus
had
some
notions
of
accounts
of
course
and
uncle
the
famous
had
been
opened
and
examined
while
he
was
there
he
had
had
to
go
through
all
the
accounts
and
make
up
a
balance
sheet
uncle
sivert
had
not
set
this
nephew
to
work
on
the
fields
or
mending
of
herring
nets
he
had
initiated
him
into
a
complex
muddle
of
figures
the
weirdest
ever
seen
if
a
man
had
paid
his
taxes
some
years
back
in
kind
with
a
goat
say
or
a
load
of
dried
cod
there
was
neither
flesh
nor
fish
to
show
for
it
now
but
old
sivert
searched
his
memory
and
said
he
paid
right
then
we
cross
him
out
said
sivert
eleseus
was
the
man
for
this
sort
of
work
he
was
bright
and
quick
and
encouraged
the
invalid
by
assuring
him
that
things
were
all
right
the
two
had
got
on
well
together
even
to
jesting
at
times
eleseus
was
a
bit
of
a
fool
perhaps
in
some
things
but
so
was
his
uncle
and
the
two
of
them
sat
there
drawing
up
elaborate
documents
in
favour
not
only
of
little
sivert
but
also
to
benefit
the
village
the
commune
which
the
old
man
had
served
for
thirty
years
oh
they
were
grand
days
i
could
have
got
a
better
man
to
help
with
all
this
than
you
eleseus
boy
said
uncle
sivert
he
sent
out
and
bought
mutton
in
the
middle
of
the
summer
fish
was
brought
up
fresh
from
the
sea
eleseus
being
ordered
to
pay
cash
from
the
chest
they
lived
well
enough
they
got
hold
of
oline
they
could
have
found
a
better
person
to
invite
to
a
feast
nor
one
more
sure
to
spread
abroad
the
news
of
uncle
sivert
greatness
to
the
end
and
the
satisfaction
was
mutual
we
must
do
something
for
oline
too
said
uncle
sivert
she
being
a
widow
and
not
well
off
there
be
enough
for
little
sivert
anyhow
eleseus
managed
it
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pen
a
mere
codicil
to
the
last
will
and
testament
and
lo
oline
was
also
a
sharer
in
the
inheritance
i
look
after
you
said
uncle
sivert
to
her
if
so
be
i
get
better
this
time
and
get
about
again
on
earth
i
take
care
you
not
left
out
oline
declared
that
she
was
speechless
but
speechless
she
was
not
she
wept
and
was
touched
to
the
heart
and
grateful
there
was
none
to
compare
with
oline
for
finding
the
immediate
connection
between
a
worldly
gift
and
being
repaid
a
thousandfold
eternally
in
the
world
to
come
no
speechless
she
was
not
but
eleseus
at
first
perhaps
he
may
have
taken
a
bright
enough
view
of
his
uncle
affairs
but
after
a
while
he
began
to
think
things
over
and
talk
as
well
he
tried
at
first
with
a
slight
hint
the
accounts
are
exactly
as
they
should
be
he
said
well
never
mind
that
said
the
old
man
there
be
enough
and
to
spare
when
i
gone
you
money
outstanding
besides
maybe
said
eleseus
in
a
bank
or
so
for
so
report
had
said
h
said
the
old
man
that
as
it
may
be
but
anyhow
with
the
fishery
the
farm
and
buildings
and
stock
red
cows
and
white
cows
and
all
do
you
worry
about
that
eleseus
my
boy
eleseus
had
no
idea
what
the
fishery
business
might
be
worth
but
he
had
seen
the
live
stock
it
consisted
of
one
cow
partly
red
and
partly
white
uncle
sivert
must
have
been
delirious
some
of
the
accounts
too
were
difficult
to
make
out
at
all
they
were
a
muddle
a
bare
jumble
of
figures
especially
from
the
date
when
the
coinage
was
changed
the
district
treasurer
had
frequently
reckoned
the
small
as
if
they
were
full
no
wonder
he
fancied
himself
rich
but
when
everything
was
reduced
to
something
like
order
eleseus
feared
there
would
not
be
much
left
over
perhaps
not
enough
to
settle
at
all
ay
sivert
might
easily
promise
him
all
that
came
to
him
from
his
uncle
the
two
brothers
jested
about
it
sivert
was
not
upset
over
the
matter
not
at
all
perhaps
indeed
it
might
have
irked
him
something
more
if
he
really
had
thrown
away
five
thousand
he
knew
well
enough
that
it
had
been
a
mere
speculation
naming
him
after
his
uncle
he
had
no
claim
to
anything
there
and
now
he
pressed
eleseus
to
take
what
there
was
it
to
be
yours
of
course
said
he
come
along
let
get
it
set
down
in
writing
i
like
to
see
you
a
rich
man
do
be
too
proud
to
take
it
ay
they
had
many
a
laugh
together
sivert
indeed
was
the
one
that
helped
most
to
keep
eleseus
at
home
it
would
have
been
much
harder
but
for
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
eleseus
was
getting
rather
spoiled
again
the
three
weeks
idling
on
the
other
side
of
the
hills
had
not
done
him
any
good
he
had
also
been
to
church
there
and
made
a
show
ay
he
had
even
met
some
girls
there
here
at
sellanraa
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort
jensine
the
was
a
mere
nothing
a
worker
and
no
more
rather
suited
to
sivert
i
a
fancy
to
see
how
that
girl
barbro
from
breidablik
turned
out
now
she
grown
up
said
eleseus
one
day
well
go
down
to
axel
str√∂m
place
and
see
said
sivert
eleseus
went
down
one
sunday
ay
he
had
been
away
gained
confidence
and
high
spirits
once
more
he
had
tasted
excitement
of
a
sort
and
he
made
things
livelier
at
axel
little
place
barbro
herself
was
by
no
means
to
be
despised
at
any
rate
she
was
the
only
one
anywhere
near
she
played
the
guitar
and
talked
readily
moreover
she
did
not
smell
of
tansy
but
of
real
scent
the
sort
you
buy
in
shops
eleseus
on
his
part
let
it
be
understood
that
he
was
only
home
for
a
holiday
and
would
soon
be
called
back
to
the
office
again
but
it
was
not
so
bad
being
at
home
after
all
in
the
old
place
and
of
course
he
had
the
little
bedroom
to
live
in
but
it
was
not
like
being
in
town
nay
that
a
true
word
said
barbro
town
very
different
from
this
axel
himself
was
altogether
out
of
it
with
these
two
he
found
it
dull
with
them
and
preferred
to
go
out
and
look
over
his
land
the
pair
of
them
were
left
to
do
as
they
liked
and
eleseus
managed
things
grandly
he
told
how
he
had
been
over
to
the
neighbouring
village
to
bury
his
uncle
and
did
not
forget
to
mention
the
speech
he
had
made
over
the
coffin
when
he
took
his
leave
he
asked
barbro
to
go
part
of
the
way
home
with
him
but
barbro
thank
you
was
not
inclined
that
way
is
that
the
way
they
do
things
where
you
been
she
asked
for
the
ladies
to
escort
the
gentlemen
home
that
was
a
nasty
hit
for
eleseus
he
turned
red
and
understood
he
had
offended
her
nevertheless
he
went
down
to
maaneland
again
next
sunday
and
this
time
he
took
his
stick
they
talked
as
before
and
axel
was
out
of
it
altogether
as
before
is
a
big
place
your
father
got
said
he
and
building
again
now
it
seems
ay
it
all
very
well
for
him
said
eleseus
anxious
to
show
off
a
little
he
can
afford
it
it
another
matter
with
poor
folk
like
ourselves
how
mean
oh
have
you
heard
there
been
some
swedish
millionaires
came
down
the
other
day
and
bought
a
mine
of
him
a
copper
mine
why
you
do
say
and
he
have
got
a
heap
of
money
for
it
then
enormous
well
i
do
want
to
boast
but
it
was
at
any
rate
ever
so
many
thousands
what
was
i
going
to
say
build
you
a
deal
of
timber
lying
about
here
yourself
when
are
you
going
to
start
barbro
put
in
her
word
here
never
now
that
was
pure
exaggeration
and
impertinence
axel
had
got
his
stones
the
autumn
before
and
carted
them
home
that
winter
now
between
seasons
he
had
got
the
foundation
walls
done
and
cellar
and
all
else
all
that
remained
was
to
build
the
timbered
part
above
he
was
hoping
to
get
part
of
it
roofed
in
this
autumn
and
had
thought
of
asking
sivert
to
lend
him
a
hand
for
a
few
days
what
did
eleseus
think
of
that
eleseus
thought
like
as
not
but
why
not
ask
me
he
said
smiling
you
said
axel
and
he
spoke
with
sudden
respect
at
the
idea
you
talents
for
other
things
than
that
i
take
it
oh
but
it
was
pleasant
to
find
oneself
appreciated
here
in
the
wilds
why
i
afraid
my
hands
are
much
good
at
that
sort
of
work
said
eleseus
delicately
let
me
look
said
barbro
and
took
his
hand
axel
dropped
out
of
the
conversation
again
and
went
out
leaving
the
two
of
them
alone
they
were
of
an
age
had
been
to
school
together
and
played
and
kissed
each
other
and
raced
about
and
now
with
a
fine
disdainful
carelessness
they
talked
of
old
times
exchanging
reminiscences
and
barbro
perhaps
was
inclined
to
show
off
a
little
before
her
companion
true
this
eleseus
was
not
like
the
really
fine
young
men
in
offices
that
wore
glasses
and
gold
watches
and
so
on
but
he
could
pass
for
a
gentleman
here
in
the
wilds
there
was
no
denying
that
and
she
took
out
her
photograph
now
and
showed
him
that
what
she
looked
like
then
all
different
now
of
course
and
barbro
sighed
why
what
the
matter
with
you
now
he
asked
do
you
think
i
changed
for
the
worse
since
then
changed
for
the
worse
indeed
well
i
do
mind
telling
you
ever
so
much
prettier
now
said
he
filled
out
all
round
for
the
worse
ho
that
a
fine
idea
but
it
a
nice
dress
do
you
think
cut
open
just
a
bit
front
and
back
and
then
i
had
that
silver
chain
you
see
there
and
it
cost
a
heap
of
money
too
it
was
a
present
from
one
of
the
young
clerks
i
was
with
then
but
i
lost
it
not
exactly
lost
it
you
know
but
i
wanted
money
to
come
home
eleseus
asked
can
i
have
the
photo
to
keep
to
keep
h
what
you
give
me
for
it
oh
eleseus
knew
well
enough
what
he
wanted
to
say
but
he
dared
not
i
have
mine
taken
when
i
go
back
to
town
he
said
instead
and
send
it
you
barbro
put
away
the
photograph
no
it
the
only
one
i
left
that
was
a
stroke
of
darkness
to
his
young
heart
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
the
picture
well
give
me
something
for
it
now
she
said
laughing
and
at
that
he
up
and
kissed
her
properly
after
that
it
was
easier
all
round
eleseus
brightened
up
and
got
on
finely
they
flirted
and
joked
and
laughed
and
were
excellent
friends
when
you
took
my
hand
just
now
it
was
like
a
bit
of
down
yours
i
mean
oh
you
be
going
back
to
town
again
and
never
come
back
here
i
be
bound
said
barbro
do
you
think
i
that
sort
said
eleseus
ah
i
dare
say
there
a
somebody
there
you
fond
of
no
there
is
between
you
and
me
i
not
engaged
at
all
said
he
oh
yes
you
are
i
know
no
solemn
fact
i
not
they
carried
on
like
this
quite
a
while
eleseus
was
plainly
in
love
i
write
to
you
said
he
may
i
yes
said
she
for
i
would
be
mean
enough
if
you
did
care
about
it
you
know
and
suddenly
he
was
jealous
and
asked
i
heard
say
promised
to
axel
here
is
it
true
axel
she
said
scornfully
and
he
brightened
up
again
i
see
him
farther
but
then
she
turned
penitent
and
added
alex
he
good
enough
for
me
though
and
he
takes
in
a
paper
all
for
me
to
read
and
gives
me
things
now
and
again
lots
of
things
i
will
say
that
oh
of
course
eleseus
agreed
he
may
be
an
excellent
fellow
in
his
way
but
that
not
everything
but
the
thought
of
axel
seemed
to
have
made
barbro
anxious
she
got
up
and
said
to
eleseus
you
have
to
go
now
i
must
see
to
the
animals
next
sunday
eleseus
went
down
a
good
deal
later
than
usual
and
carried
the
letter
himself
it
was
a
letter
a
whole
week
of
excitement
all
the
trouble
it
had
cost
him
to
write
but
here
it
was
at
last
he
had
managed
to
produce
a
letter
to
fr√∂ken
barbro
bredesen
it
is
two
or
three
times
now
i
have
had
the
inexpressible
delight
of
seeing
you
again
coming
so
late
as
he
did
now
barbro
must
at
any
rate
have
finished
seeing
to
the
animals
and
might
perhaps
have
gone
to
bed
already
that
would
matter
quite
the
reverse
indeed
but
barbro
was
up
sitting
in
the
hut
she
looked
now
as
if
she
had
suddenly
lost
all
idea
of
being
nice
to
him
and
making
love
eleseus
fancied
axel
had
perhaps
got
hold
of
her
and
warned
her
here
the
letter
i
promised
you
he
said
thank
you
said
she
and
opened
it
and
read
it
through
without
seeming
much
moved
i
wish
i
could
write
as
nice
a
hand
as
that
she
said
eleseus
was
disappointed
what
had
he
done
what
was
the
matter
with
her
and
where
was
axel
he
was
not
there
beginning
to
get
tired
of
these
foolish
sunday
visits
perhaps
and
preferred
to
stay
away
or
he
might
have
had
some
business
to
keep
him
over
when
he
went
down
to
the
village
the
day
before
anyhow
he
was
not
there
what
want
to
sit
here
in
this
stuffy
old
place
for
on
a
lovely
evening
asked
eleseus
come
out
for
a
walk
i
waiting
for
axel
she
answered
axel
ca
you
live
without
axel
then
yes
but
he
want
something
to
eat
when
he
comes
back
time
went
time
dribbled
away
they
came
no
nearer
each
other
barbro
was
as
cross
and
contrary
as
ever
he
tried
telling
her
again
of
his
visit
across
the
hills
and
did
not
forget
about
the
speech
he
had
made
was
much
i
had
to
say
but
all
the
same
it
brought
out
the
tears
from
some
of
them
did
it
said
she
and
then
one
sunday
i
went
to
church
what
news
there
news
oh
nothing
only
to
have
a
look
round
not
much
of
a
priest
as
far
as
i
know
anything
about
it
no
sort
of
manner
he
had
time
went
what
think
axel
say
if
he
found
you
here
this
evening
again
said
barbro
suddenly
there
was
a
thing
to
say
it
was
as
if
she
had
struck
him
had
she
forgotten
all
about
last
time
had
they
agreed
that
he
was
to
come
this
evening
eleseus
was
deeply
hurt
and
murmured
i
can
go
if
you
like
what
have
i
done
he
asked
then
his
lips
trembling
he
was
in
distress
in
trouble
that
was
plain
to
see
done
oh
you
have
done
anything
well
what
the
matter
with
you
anyway
this
evening
with
me
ha
ha
ha
but
come
to
think
of
it
is
no
wonder
axel
should
be
angry
i
go
then
said
eleseus
again
but
she
was
still
indifferent
not
in
the
least
afraid
caring
nothing
that
he
sat
there
struggling
with
his
feelings
fool
of
a
woman
and
now
he
began
to
grow
angry
he
hinted
his
displeasure
at
first
delicately
to
the
effect
that
she
was
a
nice
sort
indeed
and
a
credit
to
her
sex
huh
but
when
that
produced
no
effect
oh
he
would
have
done
better
to
endure
it
patiently
and
say
nothing
but
he
grew
no
better
for
that
he
said
if
i
known
you
were
going
to
be
like
this
i
never
have
come
this
evening
at
all
well
what
if
you
had
said
she
you
have
lost
a
chance
of
airing
that
cane
of
yours
that
you
so
fond
of
oh
barbro
she
had
lived
in
bergen
she
knew
how
to
jeer
at
a
man
she
had
seen
real
and
could
ask
now
what
he
wanted
to
go
swinging
a
umbrella
handle
like
that
for
but
he
let
her
go
on
i
suppose
now
you
be
wanting
that
photograph
back
you
gave
me
he
said
and
if
that
did
move
her
surely
nothing
would
for
among
folks
in
the
wilds
there
was
nothing
counted
so
mean
as
to
take
back
a
gift
that
as
it
may
be
she
answered
evasively
oh
you
shall
have
it
all
right
he
answered
bravely
i
send
it
back
at
once
never
fear
and
now
perhaps
you
give
me
back
my
letter
eleseus
rose
to
his
feet
very
well
she
gave
him
back
the
letter
but
now
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
did
so
this
servant
girl
was
touched
her
friend
was
forsaking
her
for
ever
you
no
need
to
go
she
said
i
do
care
for
what
axel
says
but
eleseus
had
the
upper
hand
now
and
must
use
it
he
thanked
her
and
said
when
a
lady
carries
on
that
way
he
said
there
nothing
else
to
be
done
he
left
the
house
quietly
and
walked
up
homeward
whistling
swinging
his
stick
and
playing
the
man
huh
a
little
while
after
came
barbro
walking
up
she
called
to
him
once
or
twice
very
well
he
stopped
so
he
did
but
was
a
wounded
lion
she
sat
down
in
the
heather
looking
penitent
she
fidgeted
with
a
sprig
and
a
little
after
he
too
softened
and
asked
for
a
kiss
the
last
time
just
to
say
he
said
no
she
would
not
be
nice
and
be
a
dear
like
you
were
last
time
he
begged
and
moved
round
her
on
all
sides
stepping
quickly
if
he
could
see
his
chance
but
she
would
not
be
a
dear
she
got
up
and
there
she
stood
and
at
that
he
simply
nodded
and
went
when
he
was
out
of
sight
axel
appeared
suddenly
from
behind
some
bushes
barbro
started
all
taken
aback
and
asked
that
where
have
you
been
up
that
way
no
i
been
down
that
way
he
answered
but
i
saw
you
two
going
up
here
ho
did
you
and
a
lot
of
good
it
did
you
i
dare
say
she
cried
suddenly
furious
she
was
certainly
not
easier
to
deal
with
now
what
are
you
poking
and
sniffing
about
after
i
like
to
know
what
it
to
do
with
you
axel
was
not
in
the
best
of
temper
himself
h
so
he
been
here
again
today
well
what
if
he
has
what
do
you
want
with
him
i
want
with
him
it
what
you
want
with
him
i
like
to
ask
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
ashamed
huh
the
least
said
about
that
if
you
ask
me
said
barbro
i
here
to
sit
in
the
house
like
a
statue
i
suppose
what
have
i
got
to
be
ashamed
of
anyway
if
you
like
to
go
and
get
some
one
else
to
look
after
the
place
i
ready
to
go
you
hold
your
tongue
all
i
got
to
say
if
it
not
too
much
to
ask
i
going
back
now
to
get
your
supper
and
make
the
coffee
and
after
that
i
can
do
as
i
please
they
came
home
with
the
quarrel
at
its
height
no
they
were
not
always
the
best
of
friends
axel
and
barbro
there
was
trouble
now
and
again
she
had
been
with
him
now
for
a
couple
of
years
and
they
had
had
words
before
mostly
when
barbro
talked
of
finding
another
place
he
wanted
her
to
stay
there
for
ever
to
settle
down
there
and
share
the
house
and
life
with
him
he
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
for
him
if
he
were
left
without
help
again
and
she
had
promised
several
times
ay
in
her
more
affectionate
moments
she
would
not
think
of
going
away
at
all
but
the
moment
they
quarrelled
about
anything
she
invariably
threatened
to
go
if
for
nothing
else
she
must
go
to
have
her
teeth
seen
to
in
town
go
go
away
axel
felt
he
must
find
a
means
to
keep
her
keep
her
a
lot
barbro
cared
for
his
trying
to
keep
her
if
she
want
to
stay
ho
so
you
want
to
go
away
again
said
he
well
and
if
i
do
you
think
well
and
why
not
if
you
think
i
afraid
because
the
coming
on
but
i
can
get
a
place
in
bergen
any
day
i
like
then
said
axel
steadily
enough
it
be
some
time
before
you
can
do
that
anyway
as
long
as
you
with
child
with
child
what
are
you
talking
about
axel
stared
was
the
girl
mad
true
he
himself
should
have
been
more
patient
now
that
he
had
the
means
of
keeping
her
he
had
grown
too
confident
and
that
was
a
mistake
there
was
no
need
to
be
sharp
with
her
and
make
her
wild
he
need
not
have
ordered
her
in
so
many
words
to
help
him
with
the
potatoes
that
spring
he
might
have
planted
them
by
himself
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
for
him
to
assert
his
authority
after
they
were
married
until
then
he
ought
to
have
had
sense
enough
to
give
way
but
it
too
bad
this
business
with
eleseus
this
clerk
who
came
swaggering
about
with
his
and
all
his
fine
talk
for
a
girl
to
carry
on
like
that
when
she
was
promised
to
another
man
and
in
her
condition
it
was
beyond
understanding
up
to
then
axel
had
had
no
rival
to
compete
with
now
it
was
different
here
a
new
paper
for
you
he
said
and
here
a
bit
of
a
thing
i
got
you
do
know
if
you
care
about
it
barbro
was
cold
they
were
sitting
there
together
drinking
scalding
hot
coffee
from
the
bowl
but
for
all
that
she
answered
icy
cold
i
suppose
that
the
gold
ring
you
been
promising
me
this
twelvemonth
and
more
this
however
was
beyond
the
mark
for
it
the
ring
after
all
but
a
gold
ring
it
was
not
and
that
he
had
never
promised
her
was
an
invention
of
her
own
silver
it
was
with
gilt
hands
clasped
real
silver
with
the
mark
on
and
all
but
ah
that
unlucky
voyage
of
hers
to
bergen
barbro
had
seen
real
engagement
rings
no
use
telling
her
that
ring
huh
you
can
keep
it
yourself
what
wrong
with
it
then
wrong
with
it
there
nothing
wrong
with
it
that
i
know
she
answered
and
got
up
to
clear
the
table
why
you
needs
make
do
with
it
for
now
he
said
maybe
manage
another
some
day
barbro
made
no
answer
a
thankless
creature
was
barbro
this
evening
a
new
silver
ring
she
might
at
least
have
thanked
him
nicely
for
it
it
must
be
that
clerk
with
the
town
ways
that
had
turned
her
head
axel
could
not
help
saying
i
like
to
know
what
that
fellow
eleseus
keeps
coming
here
for
anyway
what
does
he
want
with
you
with
me
ay
is
he
such
a
greenhorn
and
ca
see
how
is
with
you
now
has
he
eyes
in
his
head
barbro
turned
on
him
straight
at
that
oh
so
you
think
you
got
a
hold
on
me
because
of
you
find
out
you
wrong
all
ho
said
axel
ay
and
i
not
stay
here
neither
but
axel
only
smiled
a
little
at
this
not
broadly
and
laughing
in
her
face
no
for
he
did
not
mean
to
cross
her
and
then
he
spoke
soothingly
as
to
a
child
be
a
good
girl
now
barbro
is
you
and
me
you
know
and
of
course
in
the
end
barbro
gave
in
and
was
good
and
even
went
to
sleep
with
the
silver
ring
on
her
finger
it
would
all
come
right
in
time
never
fear
for
the
two
in
the
hut
yes
but
what
about
eleseus
was
worse
with
him
he
found
it
hard
to
get
over
the
shameful
way
barbro
had
treated
him
he
knew
nothing
of
hysterics
and
took
it
as
all
pure
cruelty
on
her
part
that
girl
barbro
from
breidablik
thought
a
deal
too
much
of
herself
even
though
she
been
in
bergen
he
sent
her
back
the
photograph
in
a
way
of
his
own
took
it
down
himself
one
night
and
stuck
it
through
the
door
to
her
in
the
hayloft
where
she
slept
was
not
done
in
any
rough
unmannerly
way
not
at
all
he
had
fidgeted
with
the
door
a
long
time
so
as
to
wake
her
and
when
she
rose
up
on
her
elbow
and
asked
what
the
matter
ca
you
find
your
way
in
this
evening
he
understood
the
question
was
meant
for
some
one
else
and
it
went
through
him
like
a
needle
like
a
sabre
he
walked
back
home
no
no
whistling
he
did
not
care
about
playing
the
man
any
longer
a
stab
at
the
heart
is
no
light
matter
and
was
that
the
last
of
it
one
sunday
he
went
down
just
to
look
to
peep
and
spy
with
a
sickly
and
unnatural
patience
he
lay
in
hiding
among
the
bushes
staring
over
at
the
hut
and
when
at
last
there
came
a
sign
of
life
and
movement
it
was
enough
to
make
an
end
of
him
altogether
axel
and
barbro
came
out
together
and
went
across
to
the
cowshed
they
were
loving
and
affectionate
now
ay
they
had
a
blessed
hour
they
walked
with
their
arms
round
each
other
and
he
was
going
to
help
her
with
the
animals
ho
yes
eleseus
watched
the
pair
with
a
look
as
if
he
had
lost
all
as
a
ruined
man
and
his
thought
maybe
was
like
this
there
she
goes
arm
in
arm
with
axel
str√∂m
how
she
could
ever
do
it
i
ca
think
there
was
a
time
when
she
put
her
arms
round
me
and
there
they
disappeared
into
the
shed
well
let
them
huh
was
he
to
lie
here
in
the
bushes
and
forget
himself
a
nice
thing
for
him
to
lie
there
flat
on
his
belly
and
forget
himself
who
was
she
after
all
but
he
was
the
man
he
was
huh
again
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
up
brushed
the
twigs
and
dust
from
his
clothes
and
drew
himself
up
and
stood
upright
again
his
rage
and
desperation
came
out
in
a
curious
fashion
now
he
threw
all
care
to
the
winds
and
began
singing
a
ballad
of
highly
frivolous
import
and
there
was
an
earnest
expression
on
his
face
as
he
took
care
to
sing
the
worst
parts
loudest
of
all
chapter
xix
isak
came
back
from
the
village
with
a
horse
ay
it
had
come
to
that
he
had
bought
the
horse
from
the
lensmand
assistant
the
animal
was
for
sale
as
geissler
had
said
but
it
cost
two
hundred
and
forty
that
was
sixty
the
price
of
horseflesh
had
gone
up
beyond
all
bounds
when
isak
was
a
boy
the
best
horse
could
be
bought
for
fifty
but
why
had
he
never
raised
a
horse
himself
he
had
thought
of
it
had
imagined
a
nice
little
foal
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
these
two
years
past
that
was
a
business
for
folk
who
could
spare
the
time
from
their
land
could
leave
waste
patches
lying
waste
till
they
got
a
horse
to
carry
home
the
crop
the
lensmand
assistant
had
said
i
do
care
about
paying
for
a
horse
keep
myself
i
no
more
hay
than
my
womenfolk
can
get
it
in
by
themselves
while
i
away
on
duty
the
new
horse
was
an
old
idea
of
isak
he
had
been
thinking
of
it
for
years
it
was
not
geissler
who
had
put
him
up
to
it
and
he
had
also
made
preparations
such
as
he
could
a
new
stall
a
new
rope
for
tethering
it
in
the
summer
as
for
carts
he
had
some
already
he
must
make
some
more
for
the
autumn
most
important
of
all
was
the
fodder
and
he
had
not
forgotten
that
of
course
or
why
should
he
have
thought
it
so
important
to
get
that
last
patch
broken
up
last
year
if
it
had
been
to
save
getting
rid
of
one
of
the
cows
and
yet
have
enough
keep
for
a
new
horse
it
was
sown
for
green
fodder
now
that
was
for
the
calving
cows
ay
he
had
thought
it
all
out
well
might
inger
be
astonished
again
and
clap
her
hands
just
as
in
the
old
days
isak
brought
news
from
the
village
breidablik
was
to
be
sold
there
was
a
notice
outside
the
church
the
bit
of
crop
such
as
it
was
hay
and
potatoes
to
go
with
the
rest
perhaps
the
live
stock
too
a
few
beasts
only
nothing
big
is
he
going
to
sell
up
the
home
altogether
and
leave
nothing
cried
inger
and
where
he
going
to
live
in
the
village
it
was
true
enough
brede
was
going
back
to
the
tillage
but
he
had
first
tried
to
get
axel
str√∂m
to
let
him
live
there
with
barbro
he
did
succeed
brede
would
never
dream
of
interfering
with
the
relations
between
his
daughter
and
axel
so
he
was
careful
not
to
make
himself
a
nuisance
though
to
be
sure
it
was
a
hard
with
all
the
rest
axel
was
going
to
get
his
new
house
built
that
autumn
well
then
when
he
and
barbro
moved
in
there
why
could
brede
and
his
family
have
a
hut
no
was
so
with
brede
he
did
look
at
things
like
a
farmer
and
a
settler
on
new
land
he
did
understand
that
axel
had
to
move
out
because
he
wanted
the
hut
for
his
growing
stock
the
hut
was
to
be
a
new
cowshed
and
even
when
this
was
explained
to
him
he
failed
to
see
the
point
of
view
surely
human
beings
should
come
before
animals
he
said
no
a
settler
way
was
different
animals
first
a
man
could
always
find
himself
a
shelter
for
the
winter
but
barbro
put
in
a
word
herself
now
ho
so
you
put
the
animals
first
and
us
after
is
just
as
well
i
know
it
so
axel
had
made
enemies
of
a
whole
family
because
he
had
room
to
house
them
but
he
would
not
give
way
he
was
no
fool
was
axel
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
grown
more
and
more
careful
he
knew
well
that
a
crowd
like
that
moving
in
would
give
him
so
many
more
mouths
to
fill
brede
bade
his
daughter
be
quiet
and
tried
to
make
out
that
he
himself
would
rather
move
down
to
the
village
again
could
endure
life
in
the
wilderness
he
said
was
only
for
that
reason
he
was
selling
the
place
oh
but
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
not
so
much
brede
was
selling
the
place
was
the
bank
and
the
storekeeper
were
selling
up
breidablik
though
for
the
sake
of
appearances
they
let
it
be
done
in
name
that
way
he
thought
he
was
saved
from
disgrace
and
brede
was
not
altogether
dejected
when
isak
met
him
he
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
was
still
inspector
on
the
telegraph
line
that
was
a
regular
income
anyway
and
in
time
he
would
be
able
to
work
up
to
his
old
position
in
the
place
as
the
lensmand
companion
and
this
and
that
he
was
something
affected
at
the
change
of
course
was
not
so
easy
to
say
to
a
place
where
one
had
lived
and
toiled
and
moiled
so
many
years
and
come
to
care
for
but
brede
good
man
was
never
long
cast
down
was
his
best
point
the
charm
of
him
he
had
once
in
his
life
taken
it
into
his
head
to
be
a
tiller
of
the
soil
was
an
inspiration
had
come
to
him
true
he
had
not
made
a
success
of
it
but
he
had
taken
up
other
plans
in
the
same
airy
way
and
got
on
better
and
who
could
say
perhaps
his
samples
of
ore
might
after
all
turn
out
something
wonderful
in
time
and
then
look
at
barbro
he
had
got
her
fixed
up
there
at
maaneland
and
she
not
be
leaving
axel
str√∂m
now
that
he
could
swear
was
plain
indeed
for
any
one
to
see
no
there
was
nothing
to
fear
as
long
as
he
had
his
health
and
could
work
for
himself
and
those
that
looked
to
him
said
brede
olsen
and
the
children
were
just
growing
up
and
big
enough
now
to
go
out
and
make
their
own
way
in
the
world
said
he
helge
was
gone
to
the
herring
fisheries
already
and
katrine
was
going
to
help
at
the
doctor
that
left
only
the
two
youngest
well
well
there
was
a
third
on
the
way
true
but
anyhow
isak
had
more
news
from
the
village
the
lensmand
lady
had
had
a
baby
inger
suddenly
interested
at
this
boy
or
girl
why
i
did
hear
which
said
isak
but
the
lensmand
lady
had
had
a
child
after
all
after
all
the
way
she
spoken
at
the
women
club
about
the
increasing
among
the
poor
better
give
women
the
franchise
and
let
them
have
some
say
in
their
own
affairs
she
said
and
now
she
was
caught
yes
the
parson
wife
had
said
she
had
some
say
in
lots
of
things
but
her
own
affairs
are
none
the
better
for
it
ha
ha
ha
and
that
was
a
clever
saying
that
went
the
round
of
the
village
and
there
were
many
that
understood
what
was
meant
inger
no
doubt
as
well
it
was
only
isak
who
did
not
understand
isak
understood
his
work
his
calling
he
was
a
rich
man
now
with
a
big
farm
but
the
heavy
cash
payments
that
had
come
to
him
by
a
lucky
chance
he
used
but
poorly
he
put
the
money
aside
the
land
saved
him
if
he
had
lived
down
in
the
village
maybe
the
great
world
would
have
affected
even
him
so
much
gaiety
so
many
elegant
manners
and
ways
he
would
have
been
buying
useless
trifles
and
wearing
a
red
sunday
shirt
on
weekdays
here
in
the
wilds
he
was
sheltered
from
all
immoderation
he
lived
in
clear
air
washed
himself
on
sunday
mornings
and
took
a
bath
when
he
went
up
to
the
lake
those
thousand
well
was
a
gift
from
heaven
to
be
kept
intact
what
else
should
he
do
his
ordinary
outgoings
were
more
than
covered
by
the
produce
of
his
fields
and
stock
eleseus
of
course
knew
better
he
had
advised
his
father
to
put
the
money
in
the
bank
well
perhaps
that
was
the
best
but
isak
had
put
off
doing
it
for
the
present
perhaps
it
would
never
be
done
at
all
not
that
isak
was
above
taking
advice
from
his
son
eleseus
was
no
fool
as
he
showed
later
on
now
in
the
haymaking
season
he
had
tried
his
hand
with
the
scythe
but
he
was
no
master
hand
at
that
no
he
kept
close
to
sivert
and
had
to
get
him
to
use
the
whetstone
every
time
but
eleseus
had
long
arms
and
could
pick
up
hay
in
fashion
and
he
and
sivert
and
leopoldine
and
jensine
the
they
were
all
busy
now
in
the
fields
with
the
first
lot
of
hay
that
year
eleseus
did
not
spare
himself
either
but
raked
away
till
his
hands
were
blistered
and
had
to
be
wrapped
in
rags
he
had
lost
his
appetite
for
a
week
or
so
but
worked
none
the
worse
for
it
now
something
had
come
over
the
boy
it
looked
perhaps
as
if
a
certain
unhappy
love
affair
or
something
of
the
sort
a
touch
of
sorrow
and
distress
had
done
him
a
world
of
good
and
look
you
he
had
by
now
smoked
the
last
of
the
tobacco
he
had
brought
with
him
from
town
ordinarily
that
would
have
been
enough
to
make
a
clerk
go
about
banging
doors
and
expressing
himself
emphatically
upon
many
points
but
no
eleseus
only
grew
the
steadier
for
it
firmer
and
more
upright
a
man
indeed
even
sivert
the
jester
could
not
put
him
out
of
countenance
today
the
pair
of
them
were
lying
out
on
boulders
in
the
river
to
drink
and
sivert
imprudently
offered
to
get
some
extra
fine
moss
and
dry
it
for
tobacco
unless
you
rather
smoke
it
raw
he
said
i
give
you
tobacco
said
eleseus
and
reaching
out
ducked
sivert
head
and
shoulders
in
the
water
ho
one
for
him
sivert
came
back
with
his
hair
still
dripping
looks
like
eleseus
he
turning
out
for
the
good
thought
isak
to
himself
watching
his
son
at
work
and
to
inger
he
said
h
wonder
if
eleseus
he
be
staying
home
now
for
good
and
she
just
as
queerly
cautious
again
is
more
than
i
can
say
no
i
doubt
if
he
will
ho
have
you
said
a
word
of
it
to
himself
no
well
yes
i
talked
a
bit
with
him
maybe
but
that
the
way
i
think
like
to
know
now
suppose
he
a
bit
of
land
of
his
own
how
do
you
mean
if
he
work
on
a
place
of
his
own
no
well
have
you
said
anything
said
anything
ca
you
see
for
yourself
no
i
do
see
anything
in
him
eleseus
that
way
do
sit
there
talking
ill
of
him
said
isak
impartially
all
i
can
see
is
he
doing
a
good
day
work
down
there
ay
maybe
said
inger
submissively
and
i
ca
see
what
you
got
to
find
fault
with
the
lad
cried
isak
evidently
displeased
he
does
his
work
better
and
better
every
day
and
what
can
you
ask
more
inger
murmured
ay
but
he
not
like
he
used
to
be
you
try
talking
to
him
about
waistcoats
about
waistcoats
what
mean
how
he
used
to
wear
white
waistcoats
in
summer
when
he
was
in
town
so
he
says
isak
pondered
this
a
while
it
was
beyond
him
well
ca
he
have
a
white
waistcoat
he
said
isak
was
out
of
his
depth
here
of
course
it
was
only
women
nonsense
to
his
mind
the
boy
had
a
perfect
right
to
a
white
waistcoat
if
it
pleased
him
anyhow
he
could
see
what
there
was
to
make
a
fuss
about
and
was
inclined
to
put
the
matter
aside
and
go
on
well
what
do
you
think
if
he
had
brede
bit
of
land
to
work
on
who
said
inger
him
eleseus
breidablik
nay
is
more
than
worth
your
while
the
fact
was
she
had
already
been
talking
over
that
very
plan
with
eleseus
she
had
heard
it
from
sivert
who
could
not
keep
the
secret
and
indeed
why
should
sivert
keep
the
matter
secret
when
his
father
had
surely
told
him
of
it
on
purpose
to
feel
his
way
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
used
sivert
as
a
well
but
what
had
eleseus
answered
just
as
before
as
in
his
letters
from
town
that
no
he
would
not
throw
away
all
he
had
learned
and
be
an
insignificant
nothing
again
that
was
what
he
had
said
well
and
then
his
mother
had
brought
out
all
her
good
reasons
but
eleseus
had
said
no
to
them
all
he
had
other
plans
for
his
life
young
hearts
have
their
unfathomable
depths
and
after
what
had
happened
likely
enough
he
did
not
care
about
staying
on
with
barbro
as
a
neighbour
who
could
say
he
had
put
it
loftily
enough
in
talking
to
his
mother
he
could
get
a
better
position
in
town
than
the
one
he
had
could
go
as
clerk
to
one
of
the
higher
officials
he
must
get
on
he
must
rise
in
the
world
in
a
few
years
perhaps
he
might
be
a
lensmand
or
perhaps
a
lighthouse
keeper
or
get
into
the
customs
there
were
so
many
roads
open
to
a
man
with
learning
however
it
might
be
his
mother
came
round
was
drawn
over
to
his
point
of
view
oh
she
was
so
little
sure
of
herself
yet
the
world
had
not
quite
lost
its
hold
on
her
last
winter
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
read
occasionally
a
certain
excellent
devotional
work
which
she
had
brought
from
trondhjem
from
the
institute
but
now
eleseus
might
be
a
lensmand
one
day
and
why
not
said
eleseus
what
heyerdahl
himself
but
a
former
clerk
in
the
same
department
splendid
prospects
his
mother
herself
advised
him
not
to
give
up
his
career
and
throw
himself
away
what
was
a
man
like
that
to
do
in
the
wilds
but
why
should
eleseus
then
trouble
to
work
hard
and
steadily
as
he
was
doing
now
on
his
father
land
heaven
knows
he
had
some
reason
maybe
something
of
inborn
pride
in
him
still
perhaps
he
would
not
be
outdone
by
others
and
besides
it
would
do
him
no
harm
to
be
in
his
father
good
books
the
day
he
went
away
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
a
number
of
little
debts
in
town
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
be
able
to
settle
them
at
once
improve
his
credit
a
lot
and
it
was
not
a
question
now
of
a
mere
hundred
but
something
worth
considering
eleseus
was
far
from
stupid
but
on
the
contrary
a
sly
fellow
in
his
way
he
had
seen
his
father
come
home
and
knew
well
enough
he
was
sitting
there
in
the
window
at
that
moment
looking
out
no
harm
in
putting
his
back
into
it
then
for
a
bit
working
a
little
harder
for
the
moment
it
would
hurt
no
one
and
might
do
himself
good
eleseus
was
somehow
changed
whatever
it
might
be
something
in
him
had
been
warped
and
quietly
spoiled
he
was
not
bad
but
something
blemished
had
he
lacked
a
guiding
hand
those
last
few
years
what
could
his
mother
do
to
help
him
now
only
stand
by
him
and
agree
she
could
let
herself
be
dazzled
by
her
son
bright
prospects
for
the
future
and
stand
between
him
and
his
father
to
take
his
part
she
could
do
that
but
isak
grew
impatient
at
last
over
her
opposition
to
his
mind
the
idea
about
breidablik
was
by
no
means
a
bad
one
only
that
very
day
coming
up
he
had
stopped
the
horse
almost
without
thinking
to
look
out
with
a
critical
eye
over
the
land
ay
it
could
be
made
a
fine
place
in
proper
hands
why
not
worth
while
he
asked
inger
now
i
that
much
feeling
for
eleseus
anyway
that
i
help
him
to
it
if
you
any
feeling
for
him
then
say
never
a
word
of
breidablik
again
she
answered
ho
ay
for
he
greater
thoughts
in
his
head
than
the
like
of
us
isak
too
is
hardly
sure
of
himself
here
and
it
weakens
him
but
he
is
by
no
means
pleased
at
having
shown
his
hand
and
spoken
straight
out
about
his
plan
he
is
unwilling
to
give
it
up
now
he
shall
do
as
i
say
declares
isak
suddenly
and
he
raises
his
voice
threateningly
in
case
inger
by
any
chance
should
be
hard
of
hearing
ay
you
may
look
i
say
no
mere
it
midway
up
with
a
schoolhouse
by
and
everything
what
the
greater
thoughts
he
got
beyond
that
i
like
to
know
with
a
son
like
that
i
might
starve
to
death
is
that
any
better
think
and
can
you
tell
me
why
my
own
flesh
and
blood
should
turn
and
go
contrary
to
to
my
own
flesh
and
blood
isak
stopped
he
realized
that
the
more
he
talked
the
worse
it
would
be
he
was
on
the
point
of
changing
his
clothes
getting
out
of
his
best
things
he
had
put
on
to
go
down
to
the
village
in
but
no
he
altered
his
mind
he
would
stay
as
he
was
whatever
he
meant
by
that
you
better
say
a
word
of
it
to
eleseus
he
says
then
and
inger
answers
best
if
you
say
it
yourself
he
wo
do
as
i
say
very
well
then
isak
is
head
of
the
house
so
he
should
think
now
see
if
eleseus
dares
to
murmur
but
whether
it
were
because
he
feared
defeat
isak
draws
back
now
and
says
ay
is
true
i
might
say
a
word
of
it
myself
but
by
reason
of
having
so
many
things
to
do
and
busy
with
this
and
that
i
something
else
to
think
of
well
said
inger
in
surprise
and
isak
goes
off
again
not
very
far
only
to
the
farther
fields
but
still
he
goes
off
he
is
full
of
mysteries
and
must
hide
himself
out
of
the
way
the
fact
is
this
he
had
brought
back
a
third
piece
of
news
from
the
village
today
and
that
was
something
more
than
the
rest
something
enormous
and
he
had
hidden
it
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
there
it
stands
wrapped
up
in
sacking
and
paper
he
uncovers
it
and
lo
a
huge
machine
look
red
and
blue
wonderful
to
see
with
a
heap
of
teeth
and
a
heap
of
knives
with
joints
and
arms
and
screws
and
wheels
a
no
isak
would
not
have
gone
down
today
for
the
new
horse
if
it
had
been
for
that
machine
he
stands
with
a
marvellously
keen
expression
going
over
in
his
mind
from
beginning
to
end
the
instructions
for
use
that
the
storekeeper
had
read
out
he
sets
a
spring
here
and
shifts
a
bolt
there
then
he
oils
every
hole
and
every
crevice
then
he
looks
over
the
whole
thing
once
more
isak
had
never
known
such
an
hour
in
his
life
to
pick
up
a
pen
and
write
one
mark
on
a
paper
a
document
ay
was
a
perilous
great
thing
that
no
doubt
likewise
in
the
matter
of
a
new
harrow
he
had
once
brought
up
there
were
many
curiously
twisted
parts
in
that
to
be
considered
not
to
speak
of
the
great
circular
saw
that
had
to
be
set
in
its
course
to
the
nicety
of
a
pencil
line
never
swaying
east
nor
west
lest
it
should
fly
asunder
but
this
this
of
his
was
a
crawling
nest
of
steel
springs
and
hooks
and
apparatus
and
hundreds
of
screws
inger
was
a
bookmarker
compared
with
this
isak
harnessed
himself
to
the
shafts
and
tried
the
thing
here
was
the
wonderful
moment
and
that
was
why
he
kept
out
of
sight
and
was
his
own
horse
for
what
if
the
machine
had
been
wrongly
put
together
and
did
not
do
its
work
but
went
to
pieces
with
a
crash
no
such
calamity
happened
however
the
machine
could
cut
grass
and
so
indeed
it
ought
after
isak
had
stood
there
deep
in
study
for
hours
the
sun
had
gone
down
again
he
harnesses
himself
and
tries
it
ay
the
thing
cuts
grass
and
so
indeed
it
ought
when
the
dew
began
to
fall
close
after
the
heat
of
the
day
and
the
boys
came
out
each
with
his
scythe
to
mow
in
readiness
for
next
day
isak
came
in
sight
close
to
the
house
and
said
put
away
scythes
for
tonight
get
out
the
new
horse
you
can
and
bring
him
down
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
on
that
instead
of
going
indoors
to
his
supper
as
the
others
had
done
already
he
turned
where
he
stood
and
went
back
the
way
he
had
come
want
the
cart
then
sivert
called
after
him
no
said
his
father
and
walked
on
swelling
with
mystery
full
of
pride
with
a
little
lift
and
throw
from
the
knee
at
every
step
so
emphatically
did
he
walk
so
a
brave
man
might
walk
to
death
and
destruction
carrying
no
weapon
in
his
hand
the
boys
came
up
with
the
horse
saw
the
machine
and
stopped
dead
it
was
the
first
in
the
wilds
the
first
in
the
village
red
and
blue
a
thing
of
splendour
to
man
eyes
and
the
father
head
of
them
all
called
out
oh
in
a
careless
tone
as
if
it
were
nothing
uncommon
harness
up
to
this
machine
here
and
they
drove
it
the
father
drove
brrr
said
the
thing
and
felled
the
grass
in
swathes
the
boys
walked
behind
nothing
in
their
hands
doing
no
work
smiling
the
father
stopped
and
looked
back
h
not
as
clear
as
it
might
be
he
screws
up
a
nut
here
and
there
to
bring
the
knives
closer
to
the
ground
and
tries
again
no
not
right
yet
all
uneven
the
frame
with
the
cutters
seems
to
be
hopping
a
little
father
and
sons
discuss
what
it
can
be
eleseus
has
found
the
instructions
and
is
reading
them
here
it
says
to
sit
up
on
the
seat
when
you
drive
then
it
runs
steadier
he
says
ho
says
his
father
ay
is
so
i
know
he
answers
studied
it
all
through
he
gets
up
into
the
seat
and
starts
off
again
it
goes
steadily
now
suddenly
the
machine
stops
working
the
knives
are
not
cutting
at
all
what
wrong
now
father
down
from
his
seat
no
longer
swelling
with
pride
but
bending
an
anxious
questioning
face
down
over
the
machine
father
and
sons
all
stare
at
it
something
must
be
wrong
eleseus
stands
holding
the
instructions
here
a
bolt
or
something
says
sivert
picking
up
a
thing
from
the
grass
ho
that
all
right
then
says
his
father
as
if
that
was
all
that
was
needed
to
set
everything
in
order
i
was
just
looking
for
that
bolt
but
now
they
could
not
find
the
hole
for
it
to
fit
in
where
in
the
name
of
wonder
could
the
hole
be
now
and
it
was
now
that
eleseus
could
begin
to
feel
himself
a
person
of
importance
he
was
the
man
to
make
out
a
printed
paper
of
instructions
what
would
they
do
without
him
he
pointed
unnecessarily
long
to
the
hole
and
explained
according
to
the
illustration
the
bolt
should
fit
in
there
ay
that
where
she
goes
said
his
father
was
there
i
had
it
before
and
by
way
of
regaining
lost
prestige
he
ordered
sivert
to
set
about
looking
for
more
bolts
in
the
grass
there
ought
to
be
another
he
said
looking
very
important
as
if
he
carried
the
whole
thing
in
his
head
ca
you
find
another
well
well
it
be
in
its
hole
then
all
right
father
starts
off
again
wait
a
minute
this
is
wrong
cried
eleseus
ho
eleseus
standing
there
with
the
drawing
in
his
hand
with
the
law
in
his
hand
no
getting
away
from
him
that
spring
there
goes
outside
he
says
to
his
father
ay
what
then
why
you
got
it
in
under
you
set
it
wrong
it
a
steel
spring
and
you
have
to
fix
it
outside
else
the
bolt
jars
out
again
and
stops
the
knives
you
can
see
in
the
picture
here
i
left
my
spectacles
behind
and
ca
see
it
quite
says
his
father
something
meekly
you
can
see
better
you
set
it
as
it
should
go
i
do
want
to
go
up
to
the
house
for
my
spectacles
now
all
in
order
now
and
isak
gets
up
eleseus
calls
after
him
you
must
drive
pretty
fast
it
cuts
better
that
way
it
says
so
here
isak
drives
and
drives
and
everything
goes
well
and
brrr
says
the
machine
there
is
a
broad
track
of
cut
grass
in
his
wake
neatly
in
line
ready
to
take
up
now
they
can
see
him
from
the
house
and
all
the
womenfolk
come
out
inger
carries
little
rebecca
on
her
arm
though
little
rebecca
has
learned
to
walk
by
herself
long
since
but
there
they
come
four
womenfolk
big
and
small
hurrying
with
straining
eyes
down
towards
the
miracle
flocking
down
to
see
oh
but
now
is
isak
hour
now
he
is
truly
proud
a
mighty
man
sitting
high
aloft
dressed
in
holiday
clothes
in
all
his
finery
in
jacket
and
hat
though
the
sweat
is
pouring
off
him
he
swings
round
in
four
big
angles
goes
over
a
good
bit
of
ground
swings
round
drives
cuts
grass
passes
along
by
where
the
women
are
standing
they
are
dumbfounded
it
is
all
beyond
them
and
brrr
says
the
machine
then
isak
stops
and
gets
down
longing
no
doubt
to
hear
what
these
folk
on
earth
down
there
will
say
what
they
will
find
to
say
about
it
all
he
hears
smothered
cries
they
fear
to
disturb
him
these
beings
on
earth
in
his
lordly
work
but
they
turn
to
one
another
with
awed
questionings
and
he
hears
what
they
say
and
now
that
he
may
be
a
kind
and
fatherly
lord
and
ruler
to
them
all
to
encourage
them
he
says
there
i
just
do
this
bit
and
you
can
spread
it
tomorrow
have
you
time
to
come
in
and
have
a
bite
of
food
says
inger
all
overwhelmed
nay
i
other
things
to
do
he
answers
then
he
oils
the
machine
again
gives
them
to
understand
that
he
is
occupied
with
scientific
work
drives
off
again
cutting
more
grass
and
at
long
last
the
womenfolk
go
back
home
happy
isak
happy
folk
at
sellanraa
very
soon
the
neighbours
from
below
will
be
coming
up
axel
str√∂m
is
interested
in
things
he
may
be
up
tomorrow
but
brede
from
breidablik
he
might
be
here
that
very
evening
isak
would
not
be
loth
to
show
them
his
machine
explain
it
to
them
tell
them
how
it
works
and
all
about
it
he
can
point
out
how
that
no
man
with
a
scythe
could
ever
cut
so
fine
and
clean
but
it
costs
money
of
course
oh
a
machine
like
that
is
a
terribly
costly
thing
happy
isak
but
as
he
stops
for
oil
the
third
time
there
his
spectacles
fall
from
his
pocket
and
worst
of
all
the
two
boys
saw
it
was
there
a
higher
power
behind
that
little
happening
a
warning
against
overweening
pride
he
had
put
on
those
spectacles
time
and
again
that
day
to
study
the
instructions
without
making
out
a
word
eleseus
had
to
help
him
with
that
eyah
was
a
good
thing
no
doubt
to
be
and
by
way
of
humbling
himself
isak
determines
to
give
up
his
plan
of
making
eleseus
a
tiller
of
soil
in
the
wilds
he
will
never
say
a
word
of
it
again
not
that
the
boys
made
any
great
business
about
that
matter
of
the
spectacles
far
from
it
sivert
the
jester
had
to
say
something
of
course
it
was
too
much
for
him
he
plucked
eleseus
by
the
sleeve
and
said
here
come
along
we
go
back
home
and
throw
those
scythes
on
the
fire
father
going
to
do
all
the
mowing
now
with
his
machine
and
that
was
a
jest
indeed
book
two
chapter
i
sellanraa
is
no
longer
a
desolate
spot
in
in
the
waste
human
beings
live
here
seven
of
them
counting
great
and
small
but
in
the
little
time
the
haymaking
lasted
there
came
a
stranger
or
so
folk
wanting
to
see
the
brede
olsen
was
first
of
course
but
axel
str√∂m
came
too
and
other
neighbours
from
lower
down
ay
from
right
down
in
the
village
and
from
across
the
hills
came
oline
the
imperishable
oline
this
time
too
she
brought
news
with
her
from
her
own
village
was
not
oline
way
to
come
empty
of
gossip
old
sivert
affairs
had
been
gone
into
his
accounts
reckoned
up
and
the
fortune
remaining
after
him
come
to
nothing
nothing
here
oline
pressed
her
lips
together
and
looked
from
one
to
another
well
was
there
not
a
sigh
would
not
the
roof
fall
down
eleseus
was
the
first
to
smile
let
see
you
called
after
your
uncle
sivert
are
you
he
asked
softly
and
little
sivert
answered
as
softly
again
that
so
but
i
made
you
a
present
of
all
that
might
come
to
me
after
him
and
how
much
was
it
between
five
and
ten
thousand
cried
eleseus
suddenly
mimicking
his
brother
oline
no
doubt
thought
this
jesting
oh
she
had
herself
been
cheated
of
her
due
for
all
that
she
had
managed
to
squeeze
out
something
like
real
tears
over
old
sivert
grave
eleseus
should
know
best
what
he
himself
had
written
much
to
oline
to
be
a
comfort
and
support
in
her
declining
years
and
where
was
that
support
oh
a
broken
reed
poor
oline
they
might
have
left
her
something
single
golden
gleam
in
her
life
oline
was
not
with
this
world
goods
practised
in
evil
ay
well
used
to
edging
her
way
by
tricks
and
little
meannesses
from
day
to
day
strong
only
as
a
scandalmonger
as
one
whose
tongue
was
to
be
feared
ay
so
but
nothing
could
have
made
her
worse
than
before
least
of
all
a
pittance
left
her
by
the
dead
she
had
toiled
all
her
life
had
borne
children
and
taught
them
her
own
few
arts
begged
for
them
maybe
stolen
for
them
but
always
managing
for
them
somehow
a
mother
in
her
poor
way
her
powers
were
not
less
than
those
of
other
politicians
she
acted
for
herself
and
those
belonging
to
her
set
her
speech
according
to
the
moment
and
gained
her
end
earning
a
cheese
or
a
handful
of
wool
each
time
she
also
could
live
and
die
in
commonplace
insincerity
and
readiness
of
wit
oline
maybe
old
sivert
had
for
a
moment
thought
of
her
as
young
pretty
and
but
now
she
is
old
deformed
a
picture
of
decay
she
ought
to
have
been
dead
where
is
she
to
be
buried
she
has
no
family
vault
of
her
own
nay
she
will
be
lowered
down
in
a
graveyard
to
lie
among
the
bones
of
strangers
and
unknown
ay
to
that
she
comes
at
last
oline
born
and
died
she
had
been
young
once
a
pittance
left
to
her
now
at
the
eleventh
hour
ay
a
single
golden
gleam
and
this
hands
would
have
been
folded
for
a
moment
justice
would
have
overtaken
her
with
its
late
reward
for
that
she
had
begged
for
her
children
maybe
stolen
for
them
but
always
managed
for
them
some
way
a
moment
and
the
darkness
would
reign
in
her
as
before
her
eyes
glower
her
fingers
feel
out
graspingly
how
much
she
would
say
what
no
more
she
would
say
she
would
be
right
again
a
mother
many
times
realizing
life
it
was
worthy
of
a
great
reward
but
all
went
otherwise
old
sivert
accounts
had
appeared
more
or
less
in
order
after
eleseus
had
been
through
them
but
the
farm
and
the
cow
the
fishery
and
nets
were
barely
enough
to
cover
the
deficit
and
it
was
due
in
some
measure
to
oline
that
things
had
turned
out
no
worse
so
earnest
was
she
in
trying
to
secure
a
small
remainder
for
herself
that
she
dragged
to
light
forgotten
items
that
she
as
gossip
and
newsmonger
for
years
remembered
still
or
matters
outstanding
which
others
would
have
passed
over
on
purpose
to
avoid
causing
unpleasantness
to
respectable
oh
that
oline
and
she
did
not
even
say
a
word
against
old
sivert
now
he
had
made
his
will
in
kindness
of
heart
and
there
would
have
been
a
plenty
after
him
but
that
the
two
men
sent
by
the
department
to
arrange
things
had
cheated
her
but
one
day
all
would
come
to
the
ears
of
the
almighty
said
oline
threateningly
strange
she
found
nothing
ridiculous
in
the
fact
that
she
was
mentioned
in
the
will
after
all
it
was
an
honour
of
a
sort
none
of
her
likes
were
named
there
with
her
the
sellanraa
folk
took
the
blow
with
patience
they
were
not
altogether
unprepared
true
inger
could
not
understand
it
uncle
sivert
that
had
always
been
so
rich
he
might
have
stood
forth
an
upright
man
and
a
wealthy
before
the
lamb
and
before
the
throne
said
oline
if
they
had
robbed
him
isak
was
standing
ready
to
go
out
to
his
fields
and
oline
said
pity
you
got
to
go
now
isak
then
i
sha
see
the
new
machine
after
all
you
got
a
new
machine
they
say
ay
ay
there
talk
of
it
about
and
how
it
cuts
quicker
than
a
hundred
scythes
and
what
have
you
got
isak
with
all
your
means
and
riches
priest
our
way
he
got
a
new
plough
with
two
handles
but
what
he
compared
with
you
and
i
tell
him
so
to
his
face
sivert
here
show
you
the
machine
he
better
at
working
her
than
his
father
said
isak
and
went
out
isak
went
out
there
is
an
auction
to
be
held
at
breidablik
that
noon
and
he
is
going
there
but
just
time
to
get
there
now
not
that
isak
any
longer
thinks
of
buying
the
place
but
the
auction
it
is
the
first
auction
held
there
in
the
wilds
and
it
would
be
strange
not
to
go
he
gets
down
as
far
as
maaneland
and
sees
barbro
and
would
pass
by
with
only
a
greeting
but
barbro
calls
to
him
and
asks
if
he
is
going
down
ay
said
isak
making
to
go
on
again
it
is
her
home
that
is
being
sold
and
that
is
why
he
answers
shortly
you
going
to
the
sale
she
asks
to
the
sale
well
i
was
only
going
down
a
bit
what
you
done
with
axel
axel
nay
i
do
know
he
gone
down
to
sale
doubt
he
be
seeing
his
chance
to
pick
up
something
for
nothing
like
the
rest
heavy
to
look
at
was
barbro
now
ay
and
sharp
and
the
auction
has
begun
isak
hears
the
lensmand
calling
out
and
sees
a
crowd
of
people
coming
nearer
he
does
not
know
them
all
there
are
some
from
other
villages
but
brede
is
fussing
about
in
his
best
finery
and
chattering
in
his
old
way
isak
so
doing
me
the
honour
to
come
and
see
my
auction
sale
thanks
thanks
ay
we
been
neighbours
and
friends
these
many
years
now
and
never
an
ill
word
between
us
brede
grows
pathetic
ay
is
strange
to
think
of
leaving
a
place
where
you
lived
and
toiled
and
grown
fond
of
but
what
a
man
to
do
when
it
fated
so
to
be
maybe
be
better
for
you
after
says
isak
comfortingly
why
says
brede
grasping
at
it
himself
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
it
will
i
not
regretting
it
not
a
bit
i
wo
say
i
made
a
fortune
on
the
place
here
but
that
to
come
maybe
and
the
young
ones
getting
older
and
leaving
the
nest
ay
is
true
the
wife
got
another
on
the
way
but
for
all
that
and
suddenly
brede
tells
his
news
straight
out
i
given
up
the
telegraph
business
what
asks
isak
i
given
up
that
telegraph
given
up
the
telegraph
ay
from
new
year
to
be
what
was
the
good
of
it
anyway
and
supposing
i
was
out
on
business
or
driving
for
the
lensmand
or
the
doctor
then
to
have
to
look
after
the
telegraph
first
of
all
no
there
no
sense
nor
meaning
in
it
that
way
well
enough
for
them
that
time
to
spare
but
running
over
hill
and
dale
after
a
telegraph
wire
for
next
to
nothing
wages
is
no
job
that
for
brede
and
then
besides
i
had
words
with
the
people
from
the
telegraph
office
about
it
they
been
making
a
fuss
again
the
lensmand
keeps
repeating
the
bids
for
the
farm
they
have
got
up
to
the
few
hundred
the
place
is
judged
to
be
worth
and
the
bidding
goes
slowly
now
with
but
five
or
ten
more
each
time
why
surely
is
axel
there
bidding
cries
brede
suddenly
and
hurries
eagerly
across
what
you
going
to
take
over
my
place
too
have
you
enough
to
look
after
i
bidding
for
another
man
says
axel
evasively
well
well
is
no
harm
to
me
was
that
i
meant
the
lensmand
raises
his
hammer
a
new
bid
is
made
a
whole
hundred
at
once
no
one
bids
higher
the
lensmand
repeats
the
figure
again
and
again
waits
for
a
moment
with
his
hammer
raised
and
then
strikes
whose
bid
axel
str√∂m
on
behalf
of
another
the
lensmand
notes
it
down
axel
str√∂m
as
agent
who
that
you
buying
for
asks
brede
not
that
it
any
business
of
mine
of
course
but
but
now
some
men
at
the
lensmand
table
are
putting
their
heads
together
there
is
a
representative
from
the
bank
the
storekeeper
has
sent
his
assistant
there
is
something
the
matter
the
creditors
are
not
satisfied
brede
is
called
up
and
brede
careless
and
only
nods
and
is
agreed
but
who
ever
have
thought
it
did
come
up
to
more
says
he
and
suddenly
he
raises
his
voice
and
declares
to
all
present
seeing
as
we
an
auction
holding
anyhow
and
i
troubled
the
lensmand
all
this
way
i
willing
to
sell
what
i
got
here
on
the
place
the
cart
live
stock
a
pitchfork
a
grindstone
i
no
use
for
the
things
now
we
sell
the
lot
small
bidding
now
brede
wife
careless
and
as
himself
for
all
the
fulness
of
her
in
front
has
begun
selling
coffee
at
a
table
she
finds
it
amusing
to
play
at
shop
and
smiles
and
when
brede
himself
comes
up
for
some
coffee
she
tells
him
jestingly
that
he
must
pay
for
it
like
the
rest
and
brede
actually
takes
out
his
lean
purse
and
pays
there
a
wife
for
you
he
says
to
the
others
thrifty
what
the
cart
is
not
worth
much
it
has
stood
too
long
uncovered
in
the
open
but
axel
bids
a
full
five
more
at
last
and
gets
the
cart
as
well
after
that
axel
buys
no
more
but
all
are
astonished
to
see
that
cautious
man
buying
so
much
as
he
has
then
came
the
animals
they
had
been
kept
in
their
shed
today
so
as
to
be
there
in
readiness
what
did
brede
want
with
live
stock
when
he
had
no
farm
to
keep
them
on
he
had
no
cows
he
had
started
farming
with
two
goats
and
had
now
four
besides
these
there
were
six
sheep
no
horse
isak
bought
a
certain
sheep
with
flat
ears
when
brede
children
led
it
out
from
the
shed
he
started
bidding
at
once
and
people
looked
at
him
isak
from
sellanraa
was
a
rich
man
in
a
good
position
with
no
need
of
more
sheep
than
he
had
brede
wife
stops
selling
coffee
for
a
moment
and
says
ay
you
may
buy
her
isak
she
old
is
true
but
she
two
and
three
lambs
every
blessed
year
and
that
the
truth
i
know
it
said
isak
looking
straight
at
her
i
seen
that
sheep
before
he
walks
up
with
axel
str√∂m
on
the
way
back
leading
his
sheep
on
a
string
axel
is
taciturn
seemingly
anxious
about
something
whatever
it
might
be
there
nothing
he
need
be
troubled
about
that
one
can
see
thinks
isak
his
crops
are
looking
well
most
of
his
fodder
is
housed
already
and
he
has
begun
timbering
his
house
all
as
it
should
be
with
axel
str√∂m
a
thought
slowly
but
sure
in
the
end
and
now
he
had
got
a
horse
so
you
bought
brede
place
said
isak
going
to
work
it
yourself
no
not
for
myself
i
bought
it
for
another
man
ho
what
think
was
it
too
much
i
gave
for
it
why
no
tis
good
land
for
a
man
that
work
it
as
it
should
i
bought
it
for
a
brother
of
mine
up
in
helgeland
ho
then
i
thought
perhaps
i
half
a
mind
to
change
with
him
too
change
with
him
would
you
and
perhaps
how
barbro
she
like
it
better
that
way
ay
maybe
said
isak
they
walk
on
for
a
good
way
in
silence
then
says
axel
they
been
after
me
to
take
over
that
telegraph
business
the
telegraph
h
ay
i
heard
that
brede
he
given
it
up
h
says
axel
smiling
is
not
so
much
that
way
of
it
but
brede
that
been
turned
off
ay
so
says
isak
and
trying
to
find
some
excuse
for
brede
it
takes
a
deal
of
time
to
look
after
no
doubt
they
gave
him
notice
to
the
new
year
if
he
did
do
better
h
you
do
think
it
be
worth
my
while
to
take
it
isak
thought
for
a
long
while
and
answered
ay
there
the
money
true
but
still
they
offered
me
more
how
much
double
double
why
then
i
say
you
should
think
it
over
but
they
made
the
line
a
bit
longer
now
no
i
do
know
best
to
do
there
not
so
much
timber
to
sell
here
as
you
got
on
yours
and
i
need
to
buy
more
things
for
the
work
that
i
got
now
and
buying
things
needs
money
in
and
i
not
so
much
out
of
the
land
and
stock
that
there
much
over
to
sell
seems
to
me
have
to
try
a
year
at
the
telegraph
to
begin
with
it
did
not
occur
to
either
of
them
that
brede
might
do
better
and
keep
the
post
himself
when
they
reached
maaneland
oline
was
there
already
on
her
way
down
ay
a
strange
creature
oline
crawling
about
fat
and
round
as
a
maggot
and
over
seventy
years
and
all
but
still
getting
about
she
sits
drinking
coffee
in
the
hut
but
seeing
the
men
come
up
all
must
give
way
to
that
and
she
comes
out
axel
and
welcome
back
from
the
sale
you
not
mind
me
looking
in
to
see
how
you
and
barbro
getting
on
and
you
getting
on
finely
to
see
and
building
a
new
house
and
getting
richer
and
richer
and
you
been
buying
sheep
isak
ay
said
isak
you
know
her
maybe
if
i
know
her
nay
with
these
flat
ears
you
can
see
flat
ears
how
mean
now
and
what
then
what
i
was
going
to
say
who
bought
brede
place
after
all
i
was
just
saying
to
barbro
here
who
be
your
neighbours
that
way
now
said
i
and
barbro
poor
thing
she
sits
crying
as
natural
enough
to
be
sure
but
the
almighty
that
decreed
her
a
new
home
here
at
maaneland
flat
ears
i
seen
a
deal
of
sheep
in
my
day
with
flat
ears
and
all
and
i
tell
you
isak
that
machine
of
yours
was
almost
more
than
my
old
eyes
could
see
nor
understand
and
what
she
have
cost
you
i
wo
even
ask
for
i
never
could
count
so
far
axel
if
you
seen
it
you
know
what
i
mean
was
all
as
it
might
be
elijah
and
his
chariot
of
fire
and
heaven
forgive
me
that
i
say
it
when
the
hay
was
all
in
eleseus
began
making
preparations
for
his
return
to
town
he
had
written
to
the
engineer
to
say
he
was
coming
but
received
the
extraordinary
reply
that
times
were
bad
and
they
would
have
to
economize
the
office
would
have
to
dispense
with
eleseus
services
and
the
chief
would
do
the
work
himself
the
deuce
and
all
but
after
all
what
did
a
district
surveyor
want
with
an
office
staff
when
he
had
taken
eleseus
on
as
a
youngster
he
had
done
so
no
doubt
only
to
show
himself
as
a
great
man
to
these
folks
in
the
wilds
and
if
he
had
given
him
clothes
and
board
till
his
confirmation
he
had
got
some
return
for
it
in
the
way
of
writing
work
that
was
true
now
the
boy
was
grown
up
and
that
made
all
the
difference
but
said
the
engineer
if
you
do
come
back
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
get
you
a
place
somewhere
else
though
it
may
be
a
difficult
matter
as
there
are
more
young
men
than
are
wanted
looking
out
for
the
same
thing
with
kind
regards
eleseus
would
go
back
to
town
of
course
there
could
be
no
question
about
that
was
he
to
throw
himself
away
he
wanted
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
he
said
nothing
to
those
at
home
as
to
the
altered
state
of
affairs
it
would
be
no
use
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
felt
a
little
out
of
humour
with
the
whole
thing
anyhow
he
said
nothing
the
life
at
sellanraa
was
having
its
effect
on
him
again
it
was
an
inglorious
commonplace
life
but
quiet
and
dulling
to
the
sense
a
dreamy
life
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
show
off
about
a
was
a
thing
he
had
no
use
for
his
town
life
had
wrought
a
schism
in
himself
and
made
him
finer
than
the
others
made
him
weaker
he
began
indeed
to
feel
that
he
must
be
homeless
anywhere
he
had
come
to
like
the
smell
of
tansy
again
let
that
pass
but
there
was
no
sense
at
all
in
a
peasant
lad
standing
listening
in
the
morning
to
the
girls
milking
the
cows
and
thinking
thus
they
milking
listen
now
is
almost
by
way
of
something
wonderful
to
hear
a
kind
of
song
in
nothing
but
little
streams
different
from
the
brass
bands
in
the
town
and
the
salvation
army
and
the
steamer
sirens
music
streaming
into
a
pail
it
was
not
the
way
at
sellanraa
to
show
one
feelings
overmuch
and
eleseus
dreaded
the
moment
when
he
would
have
to
say
he
was
well
equipped
now
again
his
mother
had
given
him
a
stock
of
woven
stuff
for
underclothes
and
his
father
had
commissioned
some
one
to
hand
him
money
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
money
could
isak
really
spare
such
a
thing
as
money
but
it
was
so
and
no
otherwise
inger
hinted
that
it
would
doubtless
be
the
last
time
for
was
not
eleseus
going
to
get
on
and
rise
in
the
world
by
himself
h
said
isak
there
was
an
atmosphere
of
solemnity
of
stillness
in
the
home
they
had
each
had
a
boiled
egg
at
the
last
meal
and
sivert
stood
outside
all
ready
to
go
down
with
his
brother
and
carry
his
things
it
was
for
eleseus
to
begin
he
began
with
leopoldine
well
and
good
she
said
in
return
and
managed
it
very
well
likewise
jensine
the
she
sat
carding
wool
and
answered
but
both
girls
stared
at
him
confound
them
and
all
because
he
might
perhaps
be
the
least
bit
red
about
the
eyes
he
shook
hands
with
his
mother
and
she
cried
of
course
quite
openly
never
caring
to
remember
how
he
hated
crying
goo
and
bl
bless
you
she
sobbed
out
it
was
worst
with
his
father
worst
of
all
with
him
oh
in
every
way
he
was
so
and
so
utterly
faithful
he
had
carried
the
children
in
his
arms
had
told
them
of
the
seagulls
and
other
birds
and
beasts
and
the
wonders
of
the
field
it
was
not
so
long
ago
a
few
years
father
stands
by
the
glass
window
then
suddenly
he
turns
round
grasps
his
son
hand
and
says
quickly
and
peevishly
well
there
the
new
horse
getting
loose
and
he
swings
out
of
the
door
and
hurries
away
oh
but
he
had
himself
taken
care
to
let
the
new
horse
loose
a
while
ago
and
sivert
the
rascal
knew
it
too
as
he
stood
outside
watching
his
father
and
smiling
to
himself
and
anyway
the
horse
was
only
in
the
rowens
eleseus
had
got
it
over
at
last
and
then
his
mother
must
needs
come
out
on
the
and
hiccup
again
and
say
god
bless
you
and
give
him
something
take
this
and
you
not
to
thank
him
he
says
you
not
to
and
forget
to
write
write
often
two
hundred
eleseus
looked
down
the
field
his
father
was
furiously
at
work
driving
a
into
the
ground
he
seemed
to
find
it
a
difficult
matter
for
all
that
the
ground
was
soft
enough
the
brothers
set
off
down
the
road
they
came
to
maaneland
and
there
stood
barbro
in
the
doorway
and
called
to
them
to
come
up
you
going
away
again
eleseus
nay
then
you
must
come
in
and
take
a
cup
of
coffee
at
least
they
go
into
the
hut
and
eleseus
is
no
longer
a
prey
to
the
pangs
of
love
nor
wishful
to
jump
out
of
windows
and
take
poison
nay
he
spreads
his
light
spring
overcoat
across
his
knees
taking
care
to
lay
it
so
the
silver
plate
is
to
be
seen
then
he
wipes
his
hair
with
his
handkerchief
and
observes
delicately
beautiful
day
it
simply
classic
barbro
too
is
enough
she
plays
with
a
silver
ring
on
one
hand
and
a
gold
ring
on
the
other
ay
true
enough
if
she
got
a
gold
ring
too
and
she
wears
an
apron
reaching
from
neck
to
feet
as
if
to
say
she
is
not
spoiled
as
to
her
figure
whoever
else
may
be
that
way
and
when
the
coffee
is
ready
and
her
guests
are
drinking
she
sews
a
little
to
begin
with
on
a
white
cloth
and
then
does
a
little
with
a
collar
of
some
sort
and
so
with
all
manner
of
maidenly
tasks
barbro
is
not
put
out
by
their
visit
and
all
the
better
they
can
talk
naturally
and
eleseus
can
be
all
on
the
surface
again
young
and
witty
as
he
pleases
what
have
you
done
with
axel
asks
sivert
oh
he
about
the
place
somewhere
she
answers
pulling
herself
up
and
so
we
not
be
seeing
you
this
way
any
more
i
doubt
she
asks
eleseus
it
hardly
probable
says
he
ay
is
no
place
for
one
as
is
used
to
the
town
i
only
wish
i
could
go
along
with
you
you
do
mean
that
i
know
do
mean
it
oh
i
known
what
it
is
to
live
in
town
and
what
it
like
here
and
i
been
in
a
bigger
town
than
you
for
that
matter
and
should
i
miss
it
i
did
mean
that
way
says
eleseus
hastily
after
you
being
in
bergen
itself
and
all
strange
how
impatient
she
was
after
all
i
only
know
that
if
it
was
for
having
the
papers
to
read
i
not
stay
here
another
day
says
she
but
what
about
axel
then
and
all
the
rest
was
that
i
was
thinking
as
for
axel
is
no
business
of
mine
and
what
about
yourself
i
doubt
there
be
some
one
waiting
for
you
in
town
and
at
that
eleseus
could
help
showing
off
a
little
and
closing
his
eyes
and
turning
over
the
morsel
on
his
tongue
perhaps
true
enough
there
was
some
one
waiting
for
him
in
town
oh
but
he
could
have
managed
this
ever
so
differently
snapped
at
the
chance
if
it
had
been
for
sivert
sitting
there
as
it
was
he
could
only
say
do
talk
such
nonsense
ho
said
she
and
indeed
she
was
shamefully
today
nonsense
indeed
well
what
can
you
expect
of
folk
at
maaneland
we
not
so
great
and
fine
as
you
no
oh
she
could
go
to
the
devil
what
did
eleseus
care
her
face
was
visibly
dirty
and
her
condition
plain
enough
now
even
to
his
innocent
eyes
ca
you
play
a
bit
on
the
guitar
he
asked
no
answered
barbro
shortly
what
i
was
going
to
say
sivert
could
you
come
and
help
axel
a
bit
with
the
new
house
a
day
or
so
if
you
could
begin
tomorrow
say
when
you
come
back
from
the
village
sivert
thought
for
a
moment
ay
maybe
but
i
no
clothes
i
could
run
up
and
fetch
your
working
clothes
this
evening
so
they
be
here
when
you
get
back
ay
said
sivert
if
you
could
and
barbro
unnecessarily
eager
now
oh
if
only
you
would
come
here
summer
nearly
gone
already
and
the
house
that
should
be
up
and
roofed
before
the
autumn
rains
axel
he
been
going
to
ask
you
a
many
times
before
but
he
could
somehow
oh
you
be
helping
us
no
end
i
help
as
well
as
i
can
said
sivert
and
that
was
settled
but
now
it
was
eleseus
turn
to
be
offended
he
can
see
well
enough
that
it
clever
of
barbro
and
all
that
to
look
out
and
manage
to
her
own
advantage
and
axel
too
and
get
help
for
the
building
and
save
the
house
but
the
whole
thing
is
a
little
too
plain
after
all
she
is
not
mistress
of
the
place
as
yet
and
it
not
so
long
since
he
himself
had
kissed
her
the
creature
was
there
never
an
atom
of
shame
in
her
at
all
ay
said
eleseus
then
suddenly
i
come
back
again
in
time
and
be
a
godfather
when
you
ready
she
sent
him
a
glance
and
answered
in
great
offence
godfather
indeed
and
who
talking
nonsense
now
i
like
to
know
be
time
enough
for
you
when
i
send
word
i
looking
out
for
godfathers
and
what
could
eleseus
do
then
but
laugh
foolishly
and
wish
himself
out
of
the
place
here
thanks
says
sivert
and
gets
up
from
his
seat
to
go
here
thanks
says
eleseus
also
but
he
did
not
rise
nor
bow
as
a
man
should
do
in
saying
thanks
for
a
cup
of
coffee
not
he
indeed
he
would
see
her
at
the
devil
for
a
lump
of
ugliness
let
me
look
said
barbro
oh
yes
the
young
men
i
stayed
with
in
town
they
had
silver
plates
on
their
overcoats
too
much
bigger
than
this
said
she
well
then
you
come
in
on
your
way
back
sivert
and
stay
the
night
i
get
your
clothes
all
right
and
that
was
to
barbro
the
brothers
went
on
again
eleseus
was
not
distressed
in
any
way
in
the
matter
of
barbro
she
could
go
to
the
devil
and
besides
he
had
two
big
in
his
pocket
the
brothers
took
care
not
to
touch
on
any
mournful
things
such
as
the
strange
way
father
had
said
or
how
mother
had
cried
they
went
a
long
way
round
to
avoid
being
stopped
at
breidablik
and
made
a
jest
of
that
little
ruse
but
when
they
came
down
in
sight
of
the
village
and
it
was
time
for
sivert
to
turn
homeward
again
they
both
behaved
in
somewhat
unmanly
fashion
sivert
for
instance
was
weak
enough
to
say
i
doubt
be
a
bit
lonely
maybe
when
you
gone
and
at
that
eleseus
must
fall
to
whistling
and
looking
to
his
shoes
and
finding
a
splinter
in
his
finger
and
searching
after
something
in
his
pockets
some
papers
he
said
could
make
out
oh
have
gone
ill
with
them
if
sivert
had
not
saved
things
at
the
last
touch
he
cried
suddenly
and
touched
his
brother
on
the
shoulder
and
sprang
away
it
was
better
after
that
they
shouted
a
word
of
farewell
or
so
from
a
distance
and
went
each
on
his
own
way
fate
or
chance
whatever
it
might
be
eleseus
went
back
after
all
to
the
town
to
a
post
that
was
no
longer
open
for
him
but
that
same
occasion
led
to
axel
str√∂m
getting
a
man
to
work
for
him
they
began
work
on
the
house
the
of
august
and
ten
days
later
the
place
was
roofed
in
oh
was
no
great
house
to
see
and
nothing
much
in
the
way
of
height
the
best
that
could
be
said
of
it
was
that
it
was
a
wooden
house
and
no
turf
hut
but
at
least
it
meant
that
the
animals
would
have
a
splendid
shelter
for
the
winter
in
what
had
been
a
house
for
human
beings
up
to
then
chapter
ii
on
the
of
september
barbro
was
not
to
be
found
was
not
that
she
was
altogether
lost
but
she
was
not
up
at
the
house
axel
was
doing
carpenter
work
the
best
he
could
he
was
trying
hard
to
get
a
glass
window
and
a
door
set
in
the
new
house
and
it
was
taking
all
his
time
to
do
it
but
being
long
past
noon
and
no
word
said
about
coming
in
to
dinner
he
went
in
himself
into
the
hut
no
one
there
he
got
himself
some
food
and
looked
about
while
he
was
eating
all
barbro
clothes
were
hanging
there
she
must
be
out
somewhere
that
was
all
he
went
back
to
his
work
on
the
new
building
and
kept
at
it
for
a
while
then
he
looked
in
at
the
hut
again
no
nobody
there
she
must
be
lying
down
somewhere
he
sets
out
to
find
her
barbro
he
calls
no
he
looks
all
round
the
houses
goes
across
to
some
bushes
on
the
edge
of
his
land
searches
about
a
long
while
maybe
an
hour
calls
out
no
he
comes
on
her
a
long
way
off
lying
on
the
ground
hidden
by
some
bushes
the
stream
flows
by
at
her
feet
she
is
barefoot
and
bareheaded
and
wet
all
up
the
back
as
well
you
lying
here
says
he
why
did
you
answer
i
could
she
answers
and
her
voice
so
hoarse
he
can
scarcely
hear
what
you
been
in
the
water
yes
slipped
down
oh
is
it
hurting
you
now
ay
it
over
now
is
it
over
says
he
yes
help
me
to
get
home
where
what
was
it
the
child
no
twas
dead
was
it
dead
yes
axel
is
slow
of
mind
and
slow
to
act
he
stands
there
still
where
is
it
then
he
asks
you
no
call
to
know
says
she
help
me
back
home
twas
dead
i
can
walk
if
you
hold
my
arm
a
bit
axel
carries
her
back
home
and
sets
her
in
a
chair
the
water
dripping
off
her
was
it
dead
he
asks
i
told
you
was
so
she
answers
what
have
you
done
with
it
then
want
to
smell
it
get
anything
to
eat
while
i
was
away
but
what
did
you
want
down
by
the
water
by
the
water
i
was
looking
for
juniper
twigs
juniper
twigs
what
for
for
cleaning
the
buckets
there
none
that
way
says
he
you
get
on
with
your
work
says
she
hoarsely
and
all
impatient
what
was
i
doing
by
the
water
i
wanted
twigs
for
a
broom
have
you
had
anything
to
eat
hear
eat
says
he
how
feel
now
tis
well
enough
i
doubt
i
better
fetch
the
doctor
up
you
better
try
says
she
getting
up
and
looking
about
for
dry
clothes
to
put
on
as
if
you
no
better
to
do
with
your
money
axel
goes
back
to
his
work
and
is
but
little
he
gets
done
but
makes
a
bit
of
noise
with
planing
and
hammering
so
she
can
hear
at
last
he
gets
the
window
wedged
in
and
stops
the
frame
all
round
with
moss
that
evening
barbro
seems
not
to
care
for
her
food
but
goes
about
all
the
same
busy
with
this
and
that
goes
to
the
cowshed
at
only
stepping
a
thought
more
carefully
over
the
she
went
to
bed
in
the
hayshed
as
usual
axel
went
in
twice
to
look
at
her
and
she
was
sleeping
soundly
she
had
a
good
night
next
morning
she
was
almost
as
usual
only
so
hoarse
she
could
hardly
speak
at
all
and
with
a
long
stocking
wound
round
her
throat
they
could
not
talk
together
days
passed
and
the
matter
was
no
longer
new
other
things
cropped
up
and
it
slipped
aside
the
new
house
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
left
a
while
for
the
timber
to
work
together
and
make
it
tight
and
sound
but
there
was
no
time
for
that
now
they
had
to
get
it
into
use
at
once
and
the
new
cowshed
ready
when
it
was
done
and
they
had
moved
in
they
took
up
the
potatoes
and
after
that
there
was
the
corn
to
get
in
life
was
the
same
as
ever
but
there
were
signs
enough
great
or
small
that
things
were
different
now
at
maaneland
barbro
felt
herself
no
more
at
home
there
now
than
any
other
no
more
bound
to
the
place
axel
could
see
that
his
hold
on
her
had
loosened
with
the
death
of
the
child
he
had
thought
to
himself
so
confidently
wait
till
the
child
comes
but
the
child
had
come
and
gone
and
at
last
barbro
even
took
off
the
rings
from
her
fingers
and
wore
neither
what
that
mean
he
asked
what
it
mean
she
said
tossing
her
head
but
it
could
hardly
mean
anything
else
than
faithlessness
and
desertion
on
her
part
and
he
had
found
the
little
body
by
the
stream
not
that
he
had
made
any
search
for
it
to
speak
of
he
knew
pretty
closely
where
it
must
be
but
he
had
left
the
matter
idly
as
it
was
then
chance
willed
it
so
that
he
should
not
forget
it
altogether
birds
began
to
hover
above
the
spot
shrieking
grouse
and
crows
and
then
later
on
a
pair
of
eagles
at
a
giddy
height
above
to
begin
with
only
a
single
bird
had
seen
something
buried
there
and
being
unable
to
keep
a
secret
like
a
human
being
had
shouted
it
abroad
then
axel
roused
himself
from
his
apathy
and
waited
for
an
opportunity
to
steal
out
to
the
spot
he
found
the
thing
under
a
heap
of
moss
and
twigs
kept
down
by
flat
stones
and
wrapped
in
a
cloth
in
a
piece
of
rag
with
a
feeling
of
curiosity
and
horror
he
drew
the
cloth
a
little
aside
eyes
closed
dark
hair
a
boy
and
the
legs
crossed
that
was
all
he
saw
the
cloth
had
been
wet
but
was
drying
now
the
whole
thing
looked
like
a
bundle
of
washing
he
could
not
leave
it
there
in
the
light
of
day
and
in
his
heart
perhaps
he
feared
some
ill
to
himself
or
to
the
place
he
ran
home
for
a
spade
and
dug
the
grave
deeper
but
being
so
near
the
stream
the
water
came
in
and
he
had
to
shift
it
farther
up
the
bank
as
he
worked
his
fear
lest
barbro
should
come
and
find
him
disappeared
he
grew
defiant
and
thoroughly
bitter
let
her
come
and
he
would
make
her
wrap
up
the
body
neatly
and
decently
after
her
stillborn
or
no
he
saw
well
enough
all
he
had
lost
by
the
death
of
the
child
how
he
was
faced
now
with
the
prospect
of
being
left
without
help
again
on
the
place
and
that
moreover
with
three
times
the
stock
to
care
for
he
had
had
at
first
let
her
come
he
did
not
care
but
barbro
it
might
be
she
had
some
inkling
of
what
he
was
at
anyway
she
did
not
come
and
axel
had
to
wrap
up
the
body
himself
as
best
he
could
and
move
it
to
the
new
grave
he
laid
down
the
turf
again
on
top
just
as
before
hiding
it
all
when
he
had
done
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
little
green
mound
among
the
bushes
he
found
barbro
outside
the
house
as
he
came
home
where
you
been
she
asked
the
bitterness
must
have
left
him
for
he
only
said
nowhere
where
you
been
oh
but
the
look
on
his
face
must
have
warned
her
she
said
no
more
but
went
into
the
house
he
followed
her
look
here
he
said
and
asked
her
straight
out
what
mean
by
taking
off
those
rings
barbro
maybe
found
it
best
to
give
way
a
little
she
laughed
and
answered
well
you
are
serious
today
i
ca
help
laughing
but
if
you
want
me
to
put
on
the
rings
and
wear
them
out
weekdays
why
i
will
and
she
got
out
the
rings
and
put
them
on
but
seeing
him
look
all
foolish
and
content
at
that
she
grew
bolder
is
there
anything
else
i
done
i
like
to
know
i
not
complaining
answered
he
and
you
only
to
be
as
you
were
before
all
the
time
before
when
you
first
came
that
all
i
mean
is
not
so
easy
to
be
always
together
and
always
agree
axel
went
on
when
i
bought
that
place
after
your
father
was
thinking
maybe
you
like
better
to
be
there
and
so
we
could
shift
what
think
ho
there
he
gave
himself
away
he
was
afraid
of
losing
her
and
being
left
without
help
with
none
to
look
to
the
place
and
the
animals
again
she
knew
ay
you
said
that
before
she
answered
coldly
ay
so
i
have
but
i
got
no
answer
answer
said
she
oh
i
sick
of
hearing
it
axel
might
fairly
consider
he
had
been
lenient
he
had
let
brede
and
his
family
stay
on
at
breidablik
and
for
all
that
he
had
bought
the
good
crop
with
the
place
he
had
carted
home
no
more
than
a
few
loads
of
hay
and
left
the
potatoes
to
them
it
was
all
unreasonable
of
barbro
to
be
contrary
now
but
she
paid
no
heed
to
that
and
asked
indignantly
so
you
have
us
move
down
to
breidablik
now
and
turn
out
a
whole
family
to
be
homeless
had
he
heard
aright
he
sat
for
a
moment
staring
and
gaping
cleared
his
throat
as
if
to
answer
thoroughly
but
it
came
to
nothing
he
only
asked
are
they
going
to
the
village
then
do
ask
me
said
barbro
or
perhaps
you
got
a
place
for
them
to
be
there
axel
was
still
loth
to
quarrel
with
her
but
he
could
not
help
letting
her
see
he
was
surprised
at
her
just
a
little
surprised
getting
more
and
more
cross
and
hard
said
he
though
you
do
mean
any
harm
belike
i
mean
every
word
i
say
she
answered
and
why
could
you
have
let
my
folks
come
up
here
answer
me
that
then
i
have
had
mother
to
help
me
a
bit
but
you
think
perhaps
i
so
little
to
do
no
need
of
help
there
was
some
sense
in
this
of
course
but
also
much
that
was
unreasonable
altogether
if
bredes
had
come
they
would
have
had
to
live
in
the
hut
and
axel
would
have
had
no
place
for
his
beasts
as
badly
off
as
before
what
was
the
woman
getting
at
had
she
neither
sense
nor
wit
in
her
head
look
here
said
he
you
better
have
a
to
help
now
with
the
winter
coming
on
and
less
to
do
than
ever
no
you
should
have
thought
of
that
when
i
needed
it
here
again
she
was
right
in
a
way
when
she
had
been
heavy
and
ailing
that
was
the
time
to
talk
of
help
but
then
barbro
herself
had
done
her
work
all
the
time
as
if
nothing
were
the
matter
she
had
been
quick
and
clever
as
usual
did
all
that
had
to
be
done
and
had
never
spoken
a
word
about
getting
help
well
i
ca
make
it
out
anyway
said
he
hopelessly
silence
barbro
asked
what
this
about
you
taking
over
the
telegraph
after
father
what
who
said
a
word
about
that
well
they
say
it
to
be
why
said
axel
it
may
come
to
something
i
not
say
no
ho
but
why
ask
nothing
said
barbro
only
that
you
turned
my
father
out
of
house
and
home
and
now
you
taking
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
silence
oh
but
that
was
the
end
of
axel
patience
i
tell
you
this
he
cried
you
not
worth
all
i
done
for
you
and
yours
ho
said
barbro
no
said
he
striking
his
fist
on
the
table
and
then
he
got
up
you
ca
frighten
me
so
do
think
whimpered
barbro
and
moved
over
nearer
the
wall
frighten
you
he
said
again
and
sniffed
scornfully
i
going
to
speak
out
now
in
earnest
what
about
that
child
did
you
drown
it
drown
it
ay
it
been
in
the
water
ho
so
you
seen
it
you
been
sniffing
at
it
she
was
going
to
say
but
dared
not
axel
was
not
to
be
played
with
just
then
by
his
looks
you
been
and
found
it
i
saw
it
had
been
in
the
water
ay
said
she
and
well
it
might
was
born
in
the
water
i
slipped
in
and
could
get
up
again
slipped
did
you
yes
and
the
child
came
before
i
could
get
out
h
said
he
but
you
took
the
bit
of
wrapping
with
you
before
you
went
out
was
that
in
case
you
should
happen
to
fall
in
wrapping
said
she
again
a
bit
of
white
rag
one
of
my
shirts
you
cut
half
across
ay
said
barbro
was
a
bit
of
rag
i
took
with
me
to
carry
back
juniper
twigs
in
juniper
twigs
yes
did
i
tell
you
that
was
what
i
been
for
ay
so
you
said
or
else
it
was
twigs
for
a
broom
well
no
matter
what
it
was
it
was
an
open
quarrel
between
them
this
time
but
even
that
died
away
after
a
time
and
all
was
well
again
that
is
to
say
not
well
exactly
no
but
passable
barbro
was
careful
and
more
submissive
she
knew
there
was
danger
but
that
way
life
at
maaneland
grew
even
more
forced
and
intolerable
no
frankness
no
joy
between
them
always
on
guard
it
could
not
last
long
but
as
long
as
it
lasted
at
all
axel
was
forced
to
be
content
he
had
got
this
girl
on
the
place
and
had
wanted
her
for
himself
and
had
her
tied
his
life
to
her
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
alter
all
that
barbro
knew
everything
about
the
place
where
pots
and
vessels
stood
when
cows
and
goats
were
to
bear
if
the
winter
feed
would
be
short
or
plenty
how
much
milk
was
for
cheese
and
how
much
for
food
a
stranger
would
know
nothing
of
it
all
and
even
so
a
stranger
was
perhaps
not
to
be
had
oh
but
axel
had
thought
many
a
time
of
getting
rid
of
barbro
and
taking
another
girl
to
help
she
was
a
wicked
thing
at
times
and
he
was
almost
afraid
of
her
even
when
he
had
the
misfortune
to
get
on
well
with
her
he
drew
back
at
times
in
fear
of
her
strange
cruelty
and
brutal
ways
but
she
was
pretty
to
look
at
and
could
be
sweet
at
times
and
bury
him
deep
in
her
arms
so
it
had
been
but
that
was
over
now
no
thank
you
barbro
was
not
going
to
have
all
that
miserable
business
over
again
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
change
let
get
married
at
once
then
said
axel
urging
her
at
once
said
she
nay
i
must
go
into
town
first
about
my
teeth
they
all
but
gone
as
it
is
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
go
on
as
before
and
barbro
had
no
real
wages
now
but
far
beyond
what
her
wages
would
have
been
and
every
time
she
asked
for
money
and
he
gave
it
she
thanked
him
as
for
a
gift
but
for
all
that
axel
could
not
make
out
where
the
money
went
what
could
she
want
money
for
out
in
the
wilds
was
she
hoarding
for
herself
but
what
on
earth
was
there
to
save
and
save
for
all
the
year
round
there
was
much
that
axel
could
not
make
out
had
he
given
her
a
ring
ay
a
real
gold
ring
and
they
had
got
on
well
together
too
after
that
last
gift
but
it
could
not
last
for
ever
far
from
it
and
he
could
not
go
on
buying
rings
to
give
her
in
a
word
did
she
mean
to
throw
him
over
women
were
strange
creatures
was
there
a
man
with
a
good
farm
and
a
place
of
his
own
waiting
for
her
somewhere
else
axel
could
at
times
go
so
far
as
to
strike
his
fist
on
the
table
in
his
impatience
with
women
and
their
foolish
humours
a
strange
thing
barbro
seemed
to
have
nothing
really
in
her
head
but
the
thought
of
bergen
and
town
life
well
and
good
but
if
so
why
had
she
come
back
at
all
confound
her
a
telegram
from
her
father
would
never
have
moved
her
a
step
in
itself
she
must
have
had
some
other
reason
and
now
here
she
was
eternally
discontented
from
morning
to
night
year
after
year
all
these
wooden
buckets
instead
of
proper
iron
pails
instead
of
saucepans
the
everlasting
milking
instead
of
a
little
walk
round
to
the
dairy
heavy
boots
yellow
soap
a
pillow
stuffed
with
hay
no
military
bands
no
people
living
like
this
they
had
many
little
bouts
after
the
one
big
quarrel
ho
time
and
again
they
were
at
it
you
say
no
more
about
it
if
you
wise
said
barbro
and
not
to
speak
of
what
you
done
about
father
and
all
said
axel
well
what
have
i
done
oh
you
know
well
enough
said
she
but
for
all
that
you
not
be
inspector
anyway
ho
no
that
you
wo
i
believe
it
when
i
see
it
meaning
i
not
good
enough
perhaps
oh
good
enough
and
good
enough
anyway
you
ca
read
nor
write
and
never
so
much
as
take
a
newspaper
to
look
at
as
to
that
said
he
i
can
read
and
write
all
i
any
need
for
but
as
for
you
with
all
your
gabble
and
talk
i
sick
of
it
well
then
here
that
to
begin
with
said
she
and
threw
down
the
silver
ring
on
the
table
ho
said
he
after
a
while
and
what
about
the
other
oh
if
you
want
your
rings
back
that
you
gave
me
you
can
have
them
said
she
trying
to
pull
off
the
gold
one
you
can
be
as
nasty
as
you
please
said
he
if
you
think
i
care
and
he
went
out
and
naturally
enough
soon
after
barbro
was
wearing
both
her
rings
again
in
time
too
she
ceased
to
care
at
all
for
what
he
said
about
the
death
of
the
child
she
simply
sniffed
and
tossed
her
head
not
that
she
ever
confessed
anything
but
only
said
well
and
suppose
i
had
drowned
it
you
live
here
in
the
wilds
and
what
do
you
know
of
things
elsewhere
once
when
they
were
talking
of
this
she
seemed
to
be
trying
to
get
him
to
see
he
was
taking
it
all
too
seriously
she
herself
thought
no
more
of
getting
rid
of
a
child
than
the
matter
was
worth
she
knew
two
girls
in
bergen
who
had
done
it
but
one
of
them
had
got
two
months
imprisonment
because
she
had
been
a
fool
and
had
killed
it
but
only
left
it
out
to
freeze
to
death
and
the
other
had
been
acquitted
no
said
barbro
the
law
not
so
cruel
hard
now
as
it
used
to
be
and
besides
it
not
always
it
gets
found
out
there
was
a
girl
in
bergen
at
the
hotel
who
had
killed
two
children
she
was
from
christiania
and
wore
a
hat
a
hat
with
feathers
in
they
had
given
her
three
months
for
the
second
one
but
the
first
was
never
discovered
said
barbro
axel
listened
to
all
this
and
grew
more
than
ever
afraid
of
her
he
tried
to
understand
to
make
out
things
a
little
in
the
darkness
but
she
was
right
after
all
he
took
these
things
too
seriously
in
his
way
with
all
her
vulgar
depravity
barbro
was
not
worth
a
single
earnest
thought
infanticide
meant
nothing
to
her
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
killing
of
a
child
she
thought
of
it
only
with
the
looseness
and
moral
nastiness
that
was
to
be
expected
of
a
it
was
plain
too
in
the
days
that
followed
never
an
hour
did
she
give
herself
up
to
thought
she
was
easy
and
natural
as
ever
unalterably
shallow
and
foolish
unalterably
a
i
must
go
and
have
my
teeth
seen
to
she
said
and
i
want
one
of
those
new
cloaks
there
was
a
new
kind
of
coat
that
had
been
fashionable
for
some
years
past
and
barbro
must
have
one
and
when
she
took
it
all
so
naturally
what
could
axel
do
but
give
way
and
it
was
not
always
that
he
had
any
real
suspicion
of
her
she
herself
had
never
confessed
had
indeed
denied
time
and
again
but
without
indignation
without
insistence
as
a
trifle
as
a
would
have
denied
having
broken
a
dish
whether
she
had
done
so
or
not
but
after
a
couple
of
weeks
axel
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
stopped
dead
one
day
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
saw
it
all
as
by
a
revelation
great
heaven
every
one
must
have
seen
how
it
was
with
her
heavy
with
child
and
plain
to
see
and
now
with
her
figure
as
before
but
where
was
the
child
suppose
others
came
to
look
for
it
they
would
be
asking
about
it
sooner
or
later
and
if
there
had
been
nothing
wrong
it
would
have
been
far
better
to
have
had
the
child
buried
decently
in
the
churchyard
not
there
in
the
bushes
there
on
his
land
no
only
have
made
a
fuss
said
barbro
they
have
cut
it
open
and
had
an
inquest
and
all
that
i
did
want
to
be
bothered
if
only
it
may
come
to
worse
later
on
said
he
barbro
asked
easily
what
there
to
worry
about
let
it
lie
where
it
is
ay
she
smiled
and
asked
are
you
afraid
it
come
after
you
leave
all
that
nonsense
and
say
no
more
about
it
ay
well
did
i
drown
the
child
i
told
you
it
drowned
itself
in
the
water
when
i
slipped
in
i
never
heard
such
things
as
you
get
in
your
head
and
anyway
it
would
never
be
found
out
said
she
was
found
out
all
the
same
with
inger
at
sellanraa
said
axel
barbro
thought
for
a
moment
well
i
do
care
said
she
the
law
all
different
now
and
if
you
read
the
papers
you
know
there
heaps
that
have
done
it
and
do
get
anything
to
speak
of
barbro
sets
out
to
explain
it
to
teach
him
as
it
were
getting
him
to
take
a
broad
view
of
things
it
was
not
for
nothing
she
herself
had
been
out
in
the
world
and
seen
and
heard
and
learned
so
much
now
she
could
sit
here
and
be
more
than
a
match
for
him
she
had
three
main
arguments
which
she
was
continually
advancing
in
the
first
place
she
had
not
done
it
in
the
second
it
was
not
such
a
terrible
thing
after
all
if
she
had
done
it
but
in
the
third
place
it
would
never
be
found
out
everything
gets
found
out
seems
to
me
he
objected
not
by
a
long
way
she
answered
and
whether
to
astonish
him
or
to
encourage
him
or
perhaps
from
sheer
vanity
and
as
something
to
boast
of
all
of
a
sudden
she
threw
a
bombshell
thus
i
done
something
myself
that
never
got
found
out
you
said
he
all
unbelieving
what
have
you
done
what
have
i
done
killed
something
she
had
not
meant
perhaps
to
go
so
far
but
she
had
to
go
on
now
there
he
was
staring
at
her
oh
and
it
was
not
grand
indomitable
boldness
even
it
was
mere
bravado
vulgar
showing
off
she
wanted
to
look
big
herself
and
silence
him
you
do
believe
me
she
cried
remember
that
in
the
paper
about
the
body
of
a
child
found
in
the
harbour
was
me
that
did
it
what
said
he
body
of
a
child
you
never
remember
anything
we
read
about
it
in
the
paper
you
brought
up
after
a
moment
he
burst
out
you
must
be
out
of
your
senses
but
his
confusion
seemed
to
incite
her
more
to
give
her
a
sort
of
artificial
strength
she
could
even
give
the
details
i
had
it
in
my
box
it
was
dead
then
of
course
i
did
that
as
soon
as
it
was
born
and
when
we
got
out
into
the
harbour
i
threw
it
overboard
axel
sat
dark
and
silent
but
she
went
on
it
was
a
long
time
back
now
many
years
the
time
she
had
first
come
to
maaneland
so
there
he
could
see
was
not
everything
was
found
out
not
by
a
long
way
what
would
things
be
like
if
everything
folk
did
got
out
what
about
all
the
married
people
in
the
towns
and
the
things
they
did
they
killed
their
children
before
they
were
born
there
were
doctors
who
managed
that
they
did
want
more
than
one
or
at
most
two
children
and
so
they
get
in
a
doctor
to
get
rid
of
it
before
it
come
ho
axel
need
not
think
that
was
such
a
great
affair
out
in
the
world
ho
said
axel
then
i
suppose
you
did
get
rid
of
the
last
one
too
that
way
no
i
did
she
answered
carelessly
as
could
be
for
i
dropped
it
she
said
but
even
then
she
must
go
on
again
about
it
being
nothing
so
terrible
if
she
had
she
was
plainly
accustomed
to
think
of
the
thing
as
natural
and
easy
it
did
not
affect
her
now
the
first
time
perhaps
it
might
have
been
a
little
uncomfortable
something
of
an
awkward
feeling
about
it
to
kill
the
child
but
the
second
she
could
think
of
it
now
with
a
sort
of
historic
sense
as
a
thing
that
had
been
done
and
could
be
done
axel
went
out
of
the
house
heavy
in
mind
he
was
not
so
much
concerned
over
the
fact
that
barbro
had
killed
her
first
child
that
was
nothing
to
do
with
himself
that
she
had
had
a
child
at
all
before
she
came
to
him
was
nothing
much
either
she
was
no
innocent
and
had
never
pretended
to
be
so
far
from
it
she
had
made
no
secret
of
her
knowledge
and
had
taught
him
many
things
in
the
dark
well
and
good
but
this
last
child
he
would
not
willingly
have
lost
it
a
tiny
boy
a
little
white
creature
wrapped
up
in
a
rag
if
she
were
guilty
of
that
child
death
then
she
had
injured
him
axel
broken
a
tie
that
he
prized
and
that
could
not
be
replaced
but
it
might
be
that
he
wronged
her
after
all
that
she
slipped
in
the
water
by
accident
but
then
the
wrapping
the
bit
of
shirt
she
had
taken
with
her
meantime
the
hours
passed
came
and
evening
and
when
axel
had
gone
to
bed
and
had
lain
staring
into
the
dark
long
enough
he
fell
asleep
at
last
and
slept
till
morning
and
then
came
a
new
day
and
after
that
day
other
days
barbro
was
the
same
as
ever
she
knew
so
much
of
the
world
and
could
take
lightly
many
little
trifles
that
were
terrible
and
serious
things
for
folk
in
the
wilds
it
was
well
in
a
way
she
was
clever
enough
for
both
of
them
careless
enough
for
both
and
she
did
not
go
about
like
a
terrible
creature
herself
barbro
a
monster
not
in
the
least
she
was
a
pretty
girl
with
blue
eyes
a
slightly
nose
and
at
her
work
she
was
utterly
sick
and
tired
of
the
farm
and
the
wooden
vessels
that
took
such
a
lot
of
cleaning
sick
and
tired
perhaps
of
axel
and
all
of
the
life
she
led
but
she
never
killed
any
of
the
cattle
and
axel
never
found
her
standing
over
him
with
uplifted
knife
in
the
middle
of
the
night
only
once
it
happened
that
they
came
to
talk
again
of
the
body
in
the
wood
axel
still
insisted
that
it
ought
to
have
been
buried
in
the
churchyard
in
consecrated
ground
but
she
maintained
as
before
that
her
way
was
good
enough
and
then
she
said
something
which
showed
that
she
was
reasoned
after
her
fashion
ho
was
sharp
enough
could
see
beyond
the
tip
of
her
nose
could
think
with
the
pitiful
little
brain
of
a
savage
if
it
gets
found
out
i
go
and
talk
to
the
lensmand
i
been
in
service
with
him
and
fru
heyerdahl
she
put
in
a
word
for
me
i
know
it
not
every
one
that
can
get
folk
to
help
them
like
that
and
they
get
off
all
the
same
and
then
besides
there
father
that
knows
all
the
great
folks
and
been
assistant
himself
and
all
the
rest
but
axel
only
shook
his
head
well
what
wrong
with
that
think
your
father
ever
be
able
to
do
anything
a
lot
you
know
about
it
she
cried
angrily
after
you
ruined
him
and
all
taking
his
farm
and
the
bread
out
of
his
mouth
she
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
idea
herself
that
her
father
reputation
had
suffered
of
late
and
that
she
might
lose
by
it
and
what
could
axel
say
to
that
nothing
he
was
a
man
of
peace
a
worker
chapter
iii
that
winter
axel
was
left
to
himself
again
at
maaneland
barbro
was
gone
ay
that
was
the
end
of
it
her
journey
to
town
would
not
take
long
she
said
was
not
like
going
to
bergen
but
she
was
going
to
stay
on
here
losing
one
tooth
after
another
till
she
a
mouth
like
a
calf
what
it
cost
said
axel
how
do
i
know
said
she
but
anyway
it
wo
cost
you
anything
i
earn
the
money
myself
she
had
explained
too
why
it
was
best
for
her
to
go
just
then
there
were
but
two
cows
to
milk
and
in
the
spring
there
would
be
two
more
besides
all
the
goats
with
kids
and
the
busy
season
and
work
enough
right
on
till
june
do
as
you
please
said
axel
it
was
not
going
to
cost
him
anything
not
at
all
but
she
must
have
some
money
to
start
with
just
a
little
there
was
the
journey
and
the
dentist
to
pay
and
besides
she
must
have
one
of
the
new
cloaks
and
some
other
little
things
but
of
course
if
he
did
care
to
you
had
money
enough
up
to
now
said
he
h
said
she
anyway
it
all
gone
have
you
put
by
anything
put
by
anything
you
can
look
in
my
box
it
you
like
i
never
put
by
anything
in
bergen
and
i
got
more
wages
then
i
no
money
to
give
you
said
he
he
had
but
little
faith
in
her
ever
coming
back
at
all
and
she
had
plagued
him
so
much
with
her
humours
this
way
and
that
he
had
grown
indifferent
at
last
and
though
he
gave
her
money
in
the
end
it
was
nothing
to
speak
of
but
he
took
no
notice
when
she
packed
away
an
enormous
hoard
of
food
to
take
with
her
and
he
drove
her
down
himself
with
her
box
to
the
village
to
meet
the
steamer
and
that
was
done
he
could
have
managed
alone
on
the
place
he
had
learned
to
do
so
before
but
it
was
awkward
with
the
cattle
if
ever
he
had
to
leave
home
there
was
none
to
look
to
them
the
storekeeper
in
the
village
had
urged
him
to
get
oline
to
come
for
the
winter
she
had
been
at
sellanraa
for
years
before
she
was
old
now
of
course
but
fit
and
able
to
work
and
axel
did
send
for
oline
but
she
had
not
come
and
sent
no
word
meantime
he
worked
in
the
forest
threshed
out
his
little
crop
of
corn
and
tended
his
cattle
it
was
a
quiet
and
lonely
life
now
and
again
sivert
from
sellanraa
would
drive
past
on
his
way
to
and
from
the
village
taking
down
loads
of
wood
or
hides
or
farm
produce
but
rarely
bringing
anything
up
home
there
was
little
they
needed
to
buy
now
at
sellanraa
now
and
again
too
brede
olsen
would
come
trudging
along
more
frequently
of
late
whatever
he
might
be
after
it
looked
as
if
he
were
trying
to
make
himself
indispensable
to
the
telegraph
people
in
the
little
time
that
remained
so
as
to
keep
his
job
he
never
came
in
to
see
axel
now
that
barbro
was
gone
but
went
straight
by
a
piece
of
ill
fitted
to
his
state
seeing
that
he
was
still
living
on
at
breidablik
and
had
not
moved
one
day
when
he
was
passing
without
so
much
as
a
word
of
greeting
axel
stopped
him
and
asked
when
he
had
thought
of
getting
out
of
the
place
what
about
barbro
and
the
way
she
left
you
asked
brede
in
return
and
one
word
led
to
another
you
sent
her
off
with
neither
help
nor
means
was
a
near
thing
but
she
never
got
to
bergen
at
all
ho
so
she
in
bergen
is
she
ay
got
there
at
last
so
she
writes
but
little
thanks
to
you
i
have
you
out
of
breidablik
and
that
sharp
said
axel
ay
if
you
be
so
kind
said
the
other
with
a
sneer
but
we
be
going
of
ourselves
at
the
new
year
he
said
and
went
on
his
way
so
barbro
was
gone
to
bergen
ay
was
as
axel
had
thought
he
did
not
take
it
to
heart
take
it
to
heart
no
indeed
he
was
well
rid
of
her
but
for
all
that
he
had
hoped
a
little
until
then
that
she
might
come
back
was
all
unreasonable
but
somehow
he
had
come
to
care
overmuch
for
the
girl
ay
for
that
devil
of
a
girl
she
had
her
sweet
moments
unforgettable
moments
and
it
was
on
purpose
to
hinder
her
from
running
off
to
bergen
that
he
had
given
her
so
little
money
for
the
journey
and
now
she
had
gone
there
after
all
a
few
of
her
clothes
still
hung
in
the
house
and
there
was
a
straw
hat
with
wings
on
wrapped
up
in
a
paper
in
the
loft
but
she
did
not
come
to
fetch
them
eyah
maybe
he
took
it
to
heart
a
little
only
a
little
and
as
if
to
jeer
at
him
as
a
mighty
jest
in
his
trouble
came
the
paper
he
had
ordered
for
her
every
week
and
it
would
not
stop
now
till
the
new
year
well
well
there
were
other
things
to
think
about
he
must
be
a
man
next
spring
he
would
have
to
put
up
a
shed
against
the
north
wall
of
the
house
the
timber
would
have
to
be
felled
that
winter
and
the
planks
cut
axel
had
no
timber
to
speak
of
not
growing
close
but
there
were
some
heavy
firs
scattered
about
here
and
there
on
the
outskirts
of
his
land
and
he
marked
out
those
on
the
side
toward
sellanraa
to
have
the
shortest
way
to
cart
his
timber
up
to
the
sawmill
and
so
one
morning
he
gives
the
beasts
an
extra
feed
to
last
them
till
the
evening
shuts
all
doors
behind
him
and
goes
out
felling
trees
besides
his
ax
and
a
basket
of
food
he
carried
a
rake
to
clear
the
snow
away
the
weather
was
mild
there
had
been
a
heavy
snowstorm
the
day
before
but
now
it
had
stopped
he
follows
the
telegraph
line
all
the
way
to
the
spot
then
pulls
off
his
jacket
and
falls
to
work
as
the
trees
are
felled
he
strips
off
the
branches
leaving
the
clean
trunks
and
piles
up
the
small
wood
in
heaps
brede
olsen
comes
by
on
his
way
up
trouble
on
the
line
no
doubt
after
yesterday
storm
or
maybe
brede
was
out
on
no
particular
errand
but
simply
from
pure
zeal
ho
he
was
mighty
keen
on
his
duty
of
late
was
brede
the
two
men
did
not
speak
did
not
so
much
as
lift
a
hand
in
greeting
the
weather
is
changing
again
the
wind
is
getting
up
axel
marks
it
but
goes
on
with
his
work
it
is
long
past
noon
and
he
has
not
yet
eaten
then
felling
a
big
fir
he
manages
to
get
in
the
way
of
its
fall
and
is
thrown
to
the
ground
he
hardly
knew
how
it
happened
but
there
it
was
a
big
fir
swaying
from
the
root
a
man
will
have
it
fall
one
way
the
storm
says
another
and
the
storm
it
is
that
wins
he
might
have
got
clear
after
all
but
the
lie
of
the
ground
was
hidden
by
snow
axel
made
a
false
step
lost
his
footing
and
came
down
in
a
cleft
of
rock
astride
of
a
boulder
pinned
down
by
the
weight
of
a
tree
well
and
what
then
he
might
still
have
got
clear
but
as
it
chanced
he
had
fallen
awkwardly
as
could
be
no
bones
broken
as
far
as
he
could
tell
but
twisted
somehow
and
unable
to
drag
himself
out
after
a
while
he
gets
one
hand
free
supporting
himself
on
the
other
but
the
ax
is
beyond
his
reach
he
looks
round
takes
thought
as
any
other
beast
in
a
trap
would
do
looks
round
and
takes
thought
and
tries
to
work
his
way
out
from
under
the
tree
brede
must
be
coming
by
on
his
way
down
before
long
he
thinks
to
himself
and
gives
himself
a
he
does
not
let
it
trouble
him
much
at
first
it
was
only
annoying
to
lose
time
at
his
work
there
is
no
thought
in
his
mind
of
being
in
danger
let
alone
in
peril
of
his
life
true
he
can
feel
the
hand
that
supports
him
growing
numbed
and
dead
his
foot
in
the
cleft
growing
cold
and
helpless
too
but
no
matter
brede
must
be
here
soon
brede
did
not
come
the
storm
increased
axel
felt
the
snow
driving
full
in
his
face
ho
is
coming
down
in
earnest
now
says
he
to
himself
still
never
troubling
much
about
it
all
ay
is
as
if
he
blinks
at
himself
through
the
snow
to
look
out
for
now
things
are
beginning
in
earnest
after
a
long
while
he
gives
a
single
shout
the
sound
would
hardly
carry
far
in
the
gale
but
it
would
be
upward
along
the
line
towards
brede
axel
lies
there
with
all
sorts
of
vain
and
useless
thoughts
in
his
head
if
only
he
could
reach
the
ax
and
perhaps
cut
his
way
out
if
he
could
only
get
his
hand
up
it
was
pressing
against
something
sharp
an
edge
of
stone
and
the
stone
was
eating
its
way
quietly
and
politely
into
the
back
of
his
hand
anyhow
if
only
that
infernal
stone
itself
had
not
been
there
but
no
one
has
ever
yet
heard
tell
of
such
a
touching
act
of
kindness
on
the
part
of
a
stone
getting
late
now
getting
later
the
snow
drifting
thick
axel
is
getting
snowed
up
himself
the
snow
packs
all
innocently
all
unknowing
about
his
face
melting
at
first
till
the
flesh
grows
cold
and
then
it
melts
no
longer
ay
now
is
beginning
in
earnest
he
gives
two
great
shouts
and
listens
his
ax
is
getting
snowed
up
now
he
can
see
but
a
bit
of
the
haft
over
there
is
his
basket
of
food
hung
on
a
tree
if
he
could
but
have
reached
it
and
had
a
feed
oh
huge
big
mouthfuls
and
then
he
goes
one
step
farther
in
his
demands
and
asks
yet
more
if
he
only
had
his
coat
on
it
is
getting
cold
he
gives
another
swinging
shout
and
there
is
brede
stopped
in
his
tracks
standing
still
looking
toward
the
man
as
he
calls
he
stands
there
but
for
a
moment
glancing
that
way
as
if
to
see
what
is
amiss
reach
me
the
ax
here
will
you
calls
axel
a
trifle
weakly
brede
looks
away
hurriedly
fully
aware
now
of
what
is
the
matter
he
glances
up
at
the
telegraph
wires
and
seems
to
be
whistling
what
can
he
mean
by
that
here
reach
me
the
ax
ca
you
cries
axel
louder
i
pinned
here
under
a
tree
but
brede
is
strangely
full
of
zeal
in
his
duty
now
he
keeps
on
looking
at
the
telegraph
wires
and
whistling
all
the
time
note
also
that
he
seems
to
be
whistling
gaily
as
it
were
vengefully
ho
so
you
going
to
murder
me
wo
even
reach
me
the
ax
cries
axel
and
at
that
it
seems
as
if
there
is
trouble
farther
down
the
line
which
brede
must
see
to
without
delay
he
moves
off
and
is
lost
to
sight
in
the
driving
snow
ho
well
and
good
but
after
that
well
it
would
just
serve
things
generally
right
if
axel
were
to
manage
by
himself
after
all
and
get
at
the
ax
without
help
from
any
one
he
strains
all
the
muscles
of
his
chest
to
lift
the
huge
weight
that
bears
him
down
the
tree
moves
he
can
feel
it
shake
but
all
he
gains
by
that
is
a
shower
of
snow
and
after
a
few
more
tries
he
gives
up
growing
dark
now
brede
is
gone
but
how
far
can
he
have
got
axel
shouts
again
and
lets
off
a
few
straightforward
words
into
the
bargain
leave
me
here
to
die
would
you
like
a
murderer
he
cries
have
ye
no
soul
nor
thought
of
what
to
come
and
the
worth
of
a
cow
no
less
to
lend
a
helping
hand
but
is
a
dog
you
are
and
ever
were
brede
and
leaving
a
man
to
die
ho
but
there
more
shall
know
of
this
never
fear
and
true
as
i
lying
here
and
wo
even
come
and
reach
me
that
ax
silence
axel
strains
away
at
the
tree
once
more
lifts
it
a
little
and
brings
down
a
new
shower
of
snow
gives
it
up
again
and
sighs
he
is
worn
out
now
and
getting
sleepy
there
the
cattle
at
home
they
be
standing
in
the
hut
and
bellowing
for
food
not
a
bite
nor
a
drop
since
the
morning
no
barbro
to
look
to
them
now
no
gone
run
off
and
gone
and
taken
both
her
rings
gold
and
silver
taken
them
with
her
getting
dark
now
ay
evening
night
well
well
but
there
the
cold
to
reckon
with
too
his
beard
is
freezing
soon
his
eyes
will
freeze
too
as
well
ay
if
he
had
but
his
jacket
from
the
tree
there
and
now
his
leg
surely
it
ca
be
that
but
all
the
same
one
leg
feels
dead
now
up
to
the
hip
all
in
god
hands
he
says
to
himself
seems
like
he
can
talk
all
godly
and
pious
when
he
will
getting
dark
ay
but
a
man
can
die
without
the
light
of
a
lamp
he
feels
all
soft
and
good
now
and
of
sheer
humility
he
smiles
foolishly
and
kindly
at
the
snowstorm
round
is
own
snow
an
innocent
thing
ay
he
might
even
forgive
brede
and
never
say
a
word
he
is
very
quiet
now
and
growing
ever
more
sleepy
ay
as
if
some
poison
were
numbing
him
all
over
and
there
is
too
much
whiteness
to
look
at
every
way
woods
and
lands
great
wings
white
veils
white
sails
white
white
what
can
it
be
nonsense
man
and
he
knows
well
enough
it
is
but
snow
he
is
lying
out
in
the
snow
is
no
fancy
that
he
is
lying
there
pinned
down
beneath
a
tree
he
shouts
again
at
hazard
throws
out
a
roar
there
in
the
snow
a
man
great
hairy
chest
swelling
to
a
roar
bellowing
so
it
could
be
heard
right
down
at
the
hut
again
and
again
ay
and
a
swine
and
a
monster
he
cries
after
brede
again
never
a
thought
of
how
leaving
me
to
lie
and
be
perished
and
could
even
reach
me
the
ax
that
was
all
i
asked
and
call
yourself
a
man
or
a
beast
of
the
field
ay
well
then
go
your
way
and
good
luck
to
you
if
that
your
will
and
thought
to
go
he
must
have
slept
he
is
all
stiff
and
lifeless
now
but
his
eyes
are
open
set
in
ice
but
open
he
can
not
wing
nor
blink
has
he
been
sleeping
with
open
eyes
dropped
off
for
a
second
maybe
or
for
an
hour
god
knows
but
here
oline
standing
before
him
he
can
hear
her
asking
in
jesu
name
say
if
there
life
in
you
and
asking
him
if
it
is
him
lying
there
and
if
he
lost
his
wits
or
no
always
something
of
a
jackal
about
oline
sniffing
and
scenting
out
always
on
the
spot
where
there
was
trouble
ay
she
would
nose
it
out
and
how
could
she
ever
have
managed
through
life
at
all
if
it
been
that
same
way
axel
word
had
reached
her
and
for
all
her
seventy
years
she
had
crossed
the
field
to
come
snowed
up
at
sellanraa
in
the
storm
of
the
day
before
and
then
on
again
to
maaneland
not
a
soul
on
the
place
fed
the
cattle
stood
in
the
doorway
listening
milked
the
cows
at
listening
again
what
could
it
be
and
then
a
cry
comes
down
and
she
nods
axel
maybe
or
maybe
the
devils
anyway
something
to
sniff
and
scent
and
find
to
worm
out
the
meaning
of
it
all
the
wisdom
of
the
almighty
with
the
dark
and
the
forest
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
he
would
never
harm
oline
that
was
not
worthy
to
unloose
the
latchet
of
his
shoes
and
there
she
stands
the
ax
oline
digs
down
and
down
in
the
snow
and
finds
no
ax
manage
without
then
and
she
strains
at
the
tree
to
lift
it
where
it
lies
but
with
no
more
strength
than
a
child
she
can
but
shake
the
branches
here
and
there
tries
for
the
ax
again
it
is
all
dark
but
she
digs
with
hands
and
feet
axel
can
not
move
a
hand
to
point
only
tell
where
it
lay
before
but
is
not
there
now
if
it
had
been
so
far
to
sellanraa
says
axel
then
oline
falls
to
searching
her
own
ways
and
axel
calls
to
her
that
there
no
ax
there
ay
well
says
oline
i
was
but
looking
a
bit
and
what
this
maybe
says
she
you
found
it
says
he
ay
by
the
grace
of
the
lord
almighty
answers
oline
with
words
but
there
little
pride
in
axel
now
no
more
than
he
give
in
that
he
was
wrong
after
all
and
maybe
not
all
clear
in
his
head
and
what
he
to
do
with
the
ax
now
is
there
he
can
not
stir
and
oline
has
to
cut
him
free
herself
oh
oline
has
wielded
an
ax
before
that
day
had
axed
off
many
a
load
of
firing
in
her
life
axel
can
not
walk
one
leg
is
dead
to
the
hip
and
something
wrong
with
his
back
shooting
pains
that
make
him
groan
curiously
ay
he
feels
but
a
part
of
himself
as
if
something
were
left
behind
there
under
the
tree
do
know
says
he
do
know
what
it
can
be
but
oline
knows
and
tells
him
now
with
solemn
words
ay
for
she
has
saved
a
human
creature
from
death
and
she
knows
it
is
the
almighty
has
seen
fit
to
lay
on
her
this
charge
where
he
might
have
sent
legions
of
angels
let
axel
consider
the
grace
and
infinite
wisdom
of
the
almighty
even
in
this
and
if
so
be
as
it
had
been
his
pleasure
to
send
a
worm
out
of
the
earth
instead
all
things
were
possible
to
him
ay
i
know
said
axel
but
i
ca
make
out
how
is
with
me
feels
strange
feels
strange
does
it
oh
but
only
wait
wait
just
a
little
was
but
to
move
and
stretch
the
least
bit
at
a
time
till
the
life
came
back
and
get
his
jacket
on
and
get
warm
again
but
never
in
all
her
days
would
she
forget
how
the
angel
of
the
lord
had
called
her
out
to
the
doorway
that
last
time
that
she
might
hear
a
voice
the
voice
of
one
crying
in
the
forest
ay
was
as
in
the
days
of
paradise
when
trumpets
blew
and
compassed
round
the
walls
of
jericho
ay
strange
but
while
she
talked
axel
was
taking
his
time
learning
the
use
of
his
limbs
again
getting
to
walk
they
get
along
slowly
towards
home
oline
still
playing
saviour
and
supporting
him
they
manage
somehow
a
little
farther
down
they
come
upon
brede
what
here
says
brede
hurt
yourself
let
me
help
a
bit
axel
takes
no
heed
he
had
given
a
promise
to
god
not
to
be
vengeful
not
to
tell
of
what
brede
had
done
but
beyond
that
he
was
free
and
what
was
brede
going
up
that
way
again
for
now
had
he
seen
that
oline
was
at
maaneland
and
guessed
that
she
would
hear
and
it
you
here
oline
is
it
goes
on
brede
easily
where
find
him
under
a
tree
well
now
is
a
curious
thing
says
he
i
was
up
that
way
just
now
on
duty
along
the
line
and
seems
like
i
heard
some
one
shouting
turns
round
and
listens
quick
as
a
flash
brede
the
man
to
lend
a
hand
if
there
need
and
so
was
axel
was
it
lying
under
a
tree
say
ay
says
axel
and
well
you
knew
that
saw
and
heard
as
well
but
never
helping
hand
good
lord
deliver
us
cries
oline
aghast
as
i
a
sinner
brede
explains
saw
why
yes
i
saw
you
right
enough
but
why
you
call
out
you
might
have
called
out
if
there
was
anything
wrong
i
saw
you
right
enough
ay
but
never
thought
but
you
were
lying
down
a
bit
to
rest
you
better
say
no
more
says
axel
warningly
you
know
well
enough
you
left
me
there
and
hoping
i
never
rise
again
oline
sees
her
way
now
brede
must
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
she
must
be
indispensable
nothing
can
come
between
her
and
axel
that
could
make
him
less
completely
indebted
to
herself
she
had
saved
him
she
alone
and
she
waves
brede
aside
will
not
even
let
him
carry
the
ax
or
the
basket
of
food
oh
for
the
moment
she
is
all
on
side
but
next
time
she
comes
to
brede
and
sits
talking
to
him
over
a
cup
of
coffee
she
will
be
on
his
let
me
carry
the
ax
and
things
anyway
says
brede
nay
says
oline
speaking
for
axel
he
take
them
himself
and
brede
goes
on
again
you
might
have
called
to
me
anyway
not
so
deadly
enemies
that
you
could
say
a
word
to
a
man
you
did
call
well
you
might
have
shouted
then
so
a
man
could
hear
blowing
a
gale
and
all
leastways
you
might
have
waved
a
hand
i
no
hand
to
wave
answers
axel
you
saw
how
was
with
me
shut
down
and
locked
in
all
ways
nay
that
i
swear
i
did
well
i
never
heard
here
let
me
carry
those
things
oline
puts
in
leave
him
alone
he
hurt
and
poorly
but
axel
mind
is
getting
to
work
again
now
he
has
heard
of
oline
before
and
understands
it
will
be
a
costly
thing
for
him
and
a
plague
besides
if
she
can
claim
to
have
saved
his
life
all
by
herself
better
to
share
between
them
as
far
as
may
be
and
he
lets
brede
take
the
basket
and
the
tools
ay
he
lets
it
be
understood
that
this
is
a
relief
that
it
eases
him
to
get
rid
of
it
but
oline
will
not
have
it
she
snatches
away
the
basket
she
and
no
other
will
carry
what
to
be
carried
there
sly
simplicity
at
war
on
every
side
axel
is
left
for
a
moment
without
support
and
brede
has
to
drop
the
basket
and
hold
him
though
axel
can
stand
by
himself
now
it
seems
then
they
go
on
a
bit
that
way
brede
holding
axel
arm
and
oline
carrying
the
things
carrying
carrying
full
of
bitterness
and
flashing
fire
a
miserable
part
indeed
to
carry
a
basket
instead
of
leading
a
helpless
man
what
did
brede
want
coming
that
way
at
all
devil
of
a
man
brede
says
she
what
it
they
saying
you
sold
your
place
and
all
and
who
it
wants
to
know
says
brede
boldly
why
as
to
that
i
never
thought
was
any
secret
not
to
be
known
why
did
you
come
to
the
sale
then
and
bid
with
the
rest
me
ay
is
like
you
to
make
a
jest
of
poor
folk
well
and
i
thought
was
you
had
grown
rich
and
grand
was
it
you
had
left
you
old
sivert
chest
and
all
his
money
in
he
he
he
oline
was
not
pleased
not
softened
at
being
minded
of
that
legacy
ay
old
sivert
he
a
kindly
thought
for
me
and
i
not
say
otherwise
but
once
he
was
dead
and
gone
was
little
they
left
after
him
in
worldly
goods
and
you
know
yourself
how
is
to
be
stripped
of
all
and
live
under
other
man
roof
but
old
sivert
he
in
palaces
and
mansions
now
and
the
likes
of
you
and
me
are
left
on
earth
to
be
spurned
underfoot
ho
you
and
your
talk
says
brede
scornfully
and
turns
to
axel
well
i
glad
i
came
in
time
help
you
back
home
not
going
too
fast
eh
no
talk
to
oline
stand
up
and
argue
with
oline
was
never
a
man
could
do
it
but
to
his
cost
never
in
life
would
she
give
in
and
never
her
match
for
turning
and
twisting
heaven
and
earth
to
a
medley
of
seeming
kindness
and
malice
poison
and
senseless
words
this
to
her
face
now
brede
making
as
if
was
himself
was
bringing
axel
home
what
i
was
going
to
say
she
begins
they
gentlemen
came
up
to
sellanraa
that
time
did
you
ever
get
to
show
them
all
those
sacks
of
stone
you
got
eh
brede
axel
says
brede
let
me
hoist
you
on
my
shoulders
and
i
carry
you
down
rest
of
the
way
nay
says
axel
for
all
it
good
of
you
to
ask
so
they
go
on
not
far
now
to
go
oline
must
make
the
best
of
her
time
on
the
way
better
if
you
saved
him
at
the
point
of
death
says
she
and
how
was
it
brede
you
coming
by
and
seeing
him
in
deadly
peril
and
heard
his
cry
and
never
stopped
to
help
you
hold
your
tongue
says
brede
and
it
might
have
been
easier
for
her
if
she
had
wading
deep
in
snow
and
out
of
breath
and
a
heavy
burden
and
all
but
was
not
way
to
hold
her
tongue
she
a
bit
in
reserve
a
dainty
morsel
ho
a
dangerous
thing
to
talk
of
but
she
dared
it
there
barbro
now
says
she
and
how
it
with
her
not
run
off
and
away
perhaps
ay
she
has
answers
brede
carelessly
and
left
a
place
for
you
for
the
winter
by
the
same
but
here
was
a
opening
for
oline
again
she
could
let
it
be
seen
now
what
a
personage
she
was
how
none
could
manage
long
without
oline
oline
that
had
to
be
sent
for
near
or
far
she
might
have
been
two
places
ay
three
for
that
matter
there
was
the
parsonage
they
have
been
glad
to
have
her
there
too
and
here
was
another
thing
ay
let
axel
hear
it
too
do
no
harm
offered
her
much
for
the
winter
not
to
speak
of
a
new
pair
of
shoes
and
a
sheepskin
into
the
bargain
but
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
coming
to
maaneland
coming
to
a
man
that
was
lordly
to
give
and
would
pay
her
over
and
above
what
other
folk
did
and
so
come
no
was
no
need
for
brede
to
trouble
himself
that
gait
when
her
heavenly
father
had
watched
over
her
all
those
years
and
opened
this
door
and
that
before
her
feet
and
bidden
her
in
ay
and
it
seemed
like
god
himself
had
known
what
he
was
doing
sending
her
up
to
maaneland
that
day
to
save
the
life
of
one
of
his
creatures
on
earth
axel
was
getting
wearied
again
by
now
his
legs
could
hardly
bear
him
and
seemed
like
giving
up
strange
he
had
been
getting
better
by
degrees
able
to
walk
as
the
life
and
warmth
came
back
into
his
body
but
now
he
must
lean
on
brede
for
support
it
seemed
to
begin
when
oline
started
talking
about
her
wages
and
then
when
she
was
saving
his
life
again
it
was
worse
than
ever
was
he
trying
to
lessen
her
triumph
once
more
heaven
knows
but
his
mind
seemed
to
be
working
again
as
they
neared
the
house
he
stopped
and
said
looks
like
i
never
get
there
after
all
brede
hoists
him
up
without
a
word
and
carries
him
so
they
go
on
like
that
oline
all
venom
axel
up
full
length
on
brede
back
what
i
was
going
to
say
gets
out
oline
about
barbro
was
she
far
gone
with
child
child
groans
brede
under
the
weight
oh
is
a
strange
procession
but
axel
lets
himself
be
carried
all
the
way
till
he
set
down
at
his
own
door
brede
puffs
and
blows
mightily
out
of
breath
ay
or
how
was
it
ever
born
after
all
asks
oline
axel
cuts
in
quickly
with
a
word
to
brede
i
do
know
how
i
ever
have
got
home
this
night
but
for
you
and
he
does
not
forget
oline
and
you
oline
that
was
the
first
to
find
me
i
to
thank
you
both
for
it
all
that
was
how
axel
was
saved
the
next
few
days
oline
would
talk
of
nothing
but
the
great
event
axel
was
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
her
within
bounds
oline
can
point
out
the
very
spot
where
she
was
standing
in
the
room
when
an
angel
of
the
lord
called
her
out
to
the
door
to
hear
a
cry
for
help
axel
goes
back
to
his
work
in
the
woods
and
when
he
has
felled
enough
begins
carting
it
up
to
the
sawmill
at
sellanraa
good
regular
winter
work
as
long
as
it
lasts
carting
up
rough
timber
and
bringing
back
sawn
planks
the
great
thing
is
to
hurry
and
get
through
with
it
before
the
new
year
when
the
frost
sets
in
in
earnest
and
the
saw
can
not
work
things
are
going
on
nicely
everything
as
well
as
could
be
wished
if
sivert
happens
to
come
up
from
the
village
with
an
empty
sledge
he
stops
and
takes
a
stick
of
timber
on
the
way
to
help
his
neighbour
and
the
pair
of
them
talk
over
things
together
and
each
is
glad
of
a
talk
with
the
other
what
the
news
down
village
asks
axel
why
nothing
much
says
sivert
there
a
new
man
coming
to
take
up
land
so
they
say
a
new
man
nothing
in
that
was
only
sivert
way
of
putting
it
new
men
came
now
every
year
or
so
to
take
up
land
there
were
five
new
holdings
now
below
breidablik
higher
up
things
went
more
slowly
for
all
that
the
soil
was
richer
that
way
the
one
who
had
ventured
farthest
was
isak
when
he
settled
down
at
sellanraa
he
was
the
boldest
and
the
wisest
of
them
all
later
axel
str√∂m
had
come
and
now
there
was
a
new
man
besides
the
new
man
was
to
have
a
big
patch
of
arable
land
and
forest
down
below
maaneland
there
was
land
enough
heard
what
sort
of
a
man
it
is
asked
axel
nay
said
sivert
but
he
bringing
up
houses
all
ready
made
to
fix
up
in
no
time
ho
a
rich
man
then
ay
seems
like
and
a
wife
and
three
children
with
him
and
horse
and
cattle
why
then
be
a
rich
man
enough
any
more
about
him
no
he
and
what
his
name
aron
they
say
calls
his
place
storborg
storborg
h
is
no
little
place
then
footnote
great
he
come
up
from
the
coast
had
a
fishery
there
so
they
say
h
fishery
wonder
if
he
knows
much
about
farming
says
axel
that
all
you
heard
nothing
more
no
he
paid
all
down
in
cash
for
the
that
all
i
heard
must
have
made
a
heap
of
money
with
his
fishery
they
say
and
now
he
going
to
start
here
with
a
store
ho
a
store
ay
so
they
say
h
so
he
going
to
start
a
store
this
was
the
one
really
important
piece
of
news
and
the
two
neighbours
talked
it
over
every
way
as
they
drove
up
it
was
a
big
piece
of
news
the
greatest
event
perhaps
in
all
the
history
of
the
place
ay
there
was
much
to
say
of
that
who
was
he
going
to
trade
with
this
new
man
the
eight
of
them
that
had
settled
on
the
common
lands
or
did
he
reckon
on
getting
custom
from
the
village
as
well
anyway
the
store
would
mean
a
lot
to
them
like
as
not
it
would
bring
up
more
settlers
again
the
holdings
might
rise
in
value
who
could
say
they
talked
it
over
as
if
they
would
never
tire
ay
here
were
two
men
with
their
own
interests
and
aims
as
great
to
them
as
other
men
the
settlement
was
their
world
work
seasons
crops
were
the
adventures
of
their
life
was
not
that
interest
and
excitement
enough
ho
enough
indeed
many
a
time
they
had
need
to
sleep
but
lightly
to
work
on
long
past
but
they
stood
it
they
endured
it
and
were
none
the
worse
a
matter
of
seven
hours
lying
pinned
down
beneath
a
tree
was
not
a
thing
to
spoil
them
for
life
as
long
as
their
limbs
were
whole
a
narrow
world
a
life
with
no
great
prospects
ho
indeed
what
of
this
new
storborg
a
shop
and
a
store
here
in
the
wilds
was
not
that
prospect
enough
they
talked
it
over
until
christmas
came
axel
had
got
a
letter
a
big
envelope
with
a
lion
on
it
it
was
from
the
state
he
was
to
fetch
supplies
of
wire
a
telegraph
apparatus
tools
and
implements
from
brede
olsen
and
take
over
inspection
of
the
line
from
new
year
day
chapter
iv
teams
of
horses
driving
up
over
the
moors
carting
up
houses
for
the
new
man
come
to
settle
in
the
wilds
load
after
load
for
days
on
end
dump
the
things
down
on
a
spot
that
is
to
be
called
storborg
answer
to
its
name
no
doubt
in
time
there
are
four
men
already
at
work
up
in
the
hills
getting
out
stone
for
a
wall
and
two
cellars
carting
loads
carting
new
loads
the
sides
of
the
house
are
built
and
ready
beforehand
is
only
to
fix
them
up
when
the
spring
comes
all
reckoned
out
neatly
and
accurately
in
advance
each
piece
with
its
number
marked
not
a
door
not
a
window
lacking
even
to
the
coloured
glass
for
the
verandah
and
one
day
a
cart
comes
up
with
a
whole
load
of
small
stakes
what
them
for
one
of
the
settlers
from
lower
down
can
tell
them
he
from
the
south
and
has
seen
the
life
before
is
for
a
garden
fence
says
he
so
the
new
man
is
going
to
have
a
garden
laid
out
in
the
wilds
a
big
garden
all
looked
well
never
before
had
there
been
such
carting
and
traffic
up
over
the
moors
and
there
were
many
that
earned
good
money
letting
out
their
horses
for
the
work
this
again
was
matter
for
discussion
there
was
the
prospect
of
making
money
in
the
future
the
trader
would
be
getting
his
goods
from
different
parts
inland
or
overseas
they
would
have
to
be
carted
up
from
the
sea
with
teams
of
horses
ay
it
looked
as
if
things
were
going
to
be
on
a
grander
scale
all
round
here
was
a
young
foreman
or
manager
in
charge
of
the
carting
work
a
lordly
young
spark
he
was
and
grumbled
at
not
getting
horses
enough
for
all
that
there
were
not
so
many
loads
to
come
but
there
ca
be
so
much
more
to
come
now
with
the
houses
all
up
they
said
ho
and
what
about
the
goods
he
answered
sivert
from
sellanraa
came
clattering
up
homeward
empty
as
usual
and
the
foreman
called
to
him
hi
what
are
you
coming
up
empty
for
why
did
you
bring
up
a
load
for
us
here
why
i
might
have
said
sivert
but
i
no
knowledge
of
it
he
from
sellanraa
they
two
horses
there
some
one
whispered
what
that
you
got
two
horses
says
the
foreman
bring
them
down
then
the
pair
of
them
to
help
with
the
cartage
here
we
pay
you
well
why
says
sivert
that
none
so
bad
dare
say
but
we
pressed
just
now
and
ca
spare
the
time
what
ca
spare
the
time
to
make
money
says
the
foreman
but
they
had
not
always
time
at
sellanraa
there
was
much
to
do
on
the
place
they
had
hired
men
to
help
the
first
time
such
a
thing
had
ever
been
done
at
sellanraa
two
stoneworkers
from
the
swedish
side
to
get
out
stone
for
a
new
cowshed
this
had
been
isak
great
idea
for
years
past
to
build
a
proper
cowshed
the
turf
hut
where
the
cattle
were
housed
at
present
was
too
small
and
out
of
repair
he
would
have
a
shed
with
double
walls
and
a
proper
under
it
was
to
be
done
now
but
there
were
many
other
things
to
be
done
as
well
one
thing
always
leading
to
another
the
building
work
at
any
rate
seemed
never
to
be
finished
he
had
a
sawmill
and
a
cornmill
and
a
summer
shed
for
the
cattle
it
was
but
reasonable
he
should
have
a
smithy
only
a
little
place
for
odd
jobs
as
need
arose
it
was
a
long
way
to
send
down
to
the
village
when
the
curled
at
the
edges
or
a
horseshoe
or
so
wanted
looking
to
just
enough
to
manage
with
that
was
all
and
why
should
he
altogether
there
were
many
outbuildings
little
and
big
at
sellanraa
the
place
is
growing
getting
bigger
and
bigger
a
mighty
big
place
at
last
impossible
now
to
manage
without
a
girl
to
help
and
jensine
has
to
stay
on
her
father
the
blacksmith
asks
after
her
now
and
again
if
she
is
coming
home
soon
but
he
does
not
make
a
point
of
it
being
an
man
and
maybe
with
his
own
reasons
for
letting
her
stay
and
there
is
sellanraa
farthest
out
of
all
the
settlements
growing
bigger
and
bigger
all
the
time
the
place
that
is
the
houses
and
the
ground
only
the
folk
are
the
same
the
day
is
gone
when
wandering
lapps
could
come
to
the
house
and
get
all
they
wanted
for
the
asking
they
come
but
rarely
now
seem
rather
to
go
a
long
way
round
and
keep
out
of
sight
none
are
even
seen
inside
the
house
but
wait
without
if
they
come
at
all
lapps
always
keep
to
the
outlying
spots
in
dark
places
light
and
air
distress
them
they
can
not
thrive
is
with
them
as
with
maggots
and
vermin
now
and
again
a
calf
or
a
lamb
disappears
without
a
trace
from
the
outskirts
of
sellanraa
from
the
farthest
edge
of
the
land
there
is
no
helping
that
and
sellanraa
can
bear
the
loss
and
even
if
sivert
could
shoot
he
has
no
gun
but
anyway
he
can
not
shoot
a
fellow
nothing
warlike
a
born
jester
and
anyway
i
doubt
but
there
a
law
against
shooting
lapps
says
he
ay
sellanraa
can
bear
the
loss
of
a
head
or
so
of
cattle
here
and
there
it
stands
there
great
and
strong
but
not
without
its
troubles
for
all
that
inger
is
not
altogether
pleased
with
herself
and
with
life
all
the
year
round
no
once
she
made
a
journey
to
a
place
a
long
way
off
and
it
seems
to
have
left
an
ugly
discontent
behind
it
may
disappear
for
a
time
but
always
it
returns
she
is
clever
and
as
in
her
best
days
and
a
handsome
healthy
wife
for
a
man
for
a
barge
of
a
man
but
has
she
no
memories
of
trondhjem
does
she
never
dream
ay
and
in
winter
most
of
all
full
of
life
and
spirits
at
times
and
wanting
no
end
of
things
but
a
woman
can
not
dance
by
herself
and
so
there
was
no
dancing
at
sellanraa
heavy
thoughts
and
books
of
devotion
ay
well
but
there
something
heaven
knows
in
the
other
sort
of
life
something
splendid
and
unequalled
she
has
learned
to
make
do
with
little
the
swedish
stoneworkers
are
something
at
any
rate
strange
faces
and
new
voices
about
the
place
but
they
are
quiet
elderly
men
given
to
work
rather
than
play
still
better
than
nothing
and
one
of
them
sings
beautifully
at
his
work
inger
stops
now
and
again
to
listen
hjalmar
is
his
name
and
that
is
not
all
the
trouble
at
sellanraa
there
is
eleseus
for
instance
a
disappointment
there
he
had
written
to
say
that
his
place
in
the
engineer
office
was
no
longer
open
but
he
was
going
to
get
another
all
right
only
wait
then
came
another
letter
he
was
expecting
something
to
turn
up
very
shortly
a
post
but
meantime
he
could
not
live
on
nothing
at
all
and
when
they
sent
him
a
note
from
home
he
wrote
back
to
say
it
was
just
enough
to
pay
off
some
small
debts
he
had
h
said
isak
but
we
these
stoneworker
folk
to
pay
and
a
deal
of
things
write
and
ask
if
he
would
rather
come
back
here
and
lend
a
hand
and
inger
wrote
but
eleseus
did
not
care
about
coming
home
again
no
no
sense
in
making
another
journey
all
to
no
purpose
he
would
rather
starve
well
perhaps
there
was
no
post
vacant
just
then
in
the
city
and
eleseus
perhaps
was
not
as
sharp
as
a
razor
in
pushing
his
way
heaven
knows
perhaps
he
was
over
clever
at
his
work
either
write
ay
he
could
write
well
enough
and
quick
and
maybe
but
there
might
be
something
lacking
for
all
that
and
if
so
what
was
to
become
of
him
when
he
arrived
from
home
with
his
two
hundred
the
city
was
waiting
for
him
with
old
accounts
outstanding
and
when
those
were
paid
well
he
had
to
get
a
proper
and
not
the
remains
of
an
umbrella
there
were
other
little
things
as
well
that
were
but
reasonable
a
fur
cap
for
the
winter
like
all
his
companions
wore
a
pair
of
skates
to
go
on
the
ice
with
as
others
did
a
silver
toothpick
which
was
a
thing
to
clean
one
teeth
and
play
with
daintily
when
chatting
with
friends
over
a
glass
of
this
or
that
and
as
long
as
he
had
money
he
stood
treat
as
far
as
he
was
able
at
a
festive
evening
held
to
celebrate
his
return
to
town
he
ordered
half
a
dozen
bottles
of
beer
and
had
them
opened
sparingly
one
after
another
what
twenty
for
the
waitress
said
his
friends
ten
quite
enough
does
do
to
be
stingy
said
eleseus
nothing
stingy
nor
mean
about
eleseus
no
he
come
from
a
good
home
from
a
big
place
where
his
father
the
margrave
owned
endless
tracts
of
timber
and
four
horses
and
thirty
cows
and
three
eleseus
was
no
liar
and
it
was
not
he
who
had
spread
abroad
all
the
fantastic
stories
about
the
sellanraa
estate
was
the
district
surveyor
who
had
amused
himself
talking
grandly
about
it
a
long
while
back
but
eleseus
was
not
displeased
to
find
the
stories
taken
more
or
less
for
truth
being
nothing
in
himself
it
was
just
as
well
to
be
the
son
of
somebody
that
counted
for
something
it
gave
him
credit
and
was
useful
that
way
but
it
could
not
last
for
ever
the
day
came
when
he
could
no
longer
put
off
paying
and
what
was
he
to
do
then
one
of
his
friends
came
to
his
help
got
him
into
his
business
a
general
store
where
the
peasants
bought
their
wares
better
than
nothing
it
was
a
poor
thing
for
a
grown
lad
to
start
at
a
beginner
wage
in
a
little
shop
no
short
cut
to
the
position
of
a
lensmand
still
it
gave
him
enough
to
live
on
helped
him
over
the
worst
for
the
present
oh
was
not
so
bad
after
all
eleseus
was
willing
and
here
too
and
people
liked
him
he
wrote
home
to
say
he
had
gone
into
trade
this
was
his
mother
greatest
disappointment
eleseus
serving
in
a
shop
was
not
a
whit
better
than
being
assistant
at
the
store
down
in
the
village
before
he
had
been
something
apart
something
different
from
the
rest
none
of
their
neighbours
had
gone
off
to
live
in
a
town
and
work
in
an
office
had
he
lost
sight
of
his
great
aim
and
end
inger
was
no
fool
she
knew
well
enough
that
there
was
a
difference
between
the
ordinary
and
the
uncommon
though
perhaps
she
did
not
always
think
to
reckon
with
it
isak
was
simpler
and
slower
of
thought
he
reckoned
less
and
less
with
eleseus
now
when
he
reckoned
at
all
his
eldest
son
was
gradually
slipping
out
of
range
isak
no
longer
thought
of
sellanraa
divided
between
his
two
sons
when
he
himself
should
be
gone
some
way
on
in
spring
came
engineers
and
workmen
from
sweden
going
to
build
roads
put
up
hutments
work
in
various
ways
blasting
levelling
getting
up
supplies
of
food
hiring
teams
of
horses
making
arrangements
with
owners
of
land
by
the
waterside
what
what
was
it
all
about
this
is
in
the
wilds
where
folk
never
came
but
those
who
lived
there
well
they
were
going
to
start
that
copper
mine
that
was
all
so
it
had
come
to
something
after
all
geissler
had
not
been
merely
boasting
it
was
not
the
same
big
men
that
had
come
with
him
that
time
no
the
two
of
them
had
stayed
behind
having
business
elsewhere
no
doubt
but
the
same
engineer
was
there
and
the
mining
expert
that
had
come
at
first
they
bought
up
all
the
sawn
planks
isak
could
spare
bought
food
and
drink
and
paid
for
it
well
chatted
in
kindly
fashion
and
were
pleased
with
sellanraa
aerial
railway
they
said
cable
haulage
from
the
top
of
the
fjeld
down
to
the
waterside
they
said
what
down
over
all
this
moorland
here
said
isak
being
slow
to
think
but
they
laughed
at
that
no
on
the
other
side
man
not
this
way
be
miles
to
go
no
on
the
other
side
of
the
fjeld
straight
down
to
the
sea
a
good
fall
and
no
distance
to
speak
of
run
the
ore
down
through
the
air
in
iron
tanks
oh
it
work
all
right
you
wait
and
see
but
we
have
to
cart
it
down
at
first
make
a
road
and
have
it
hauled
down
in
carts
we
shall
want
fifty
horses
you
see
we
get
on
finely
and
more
men
on
the
works
than
these
few
here
that
nothing
more
coming
up
from
the
other
side
gangs
of
men
with
huts
all
ready
to
put
up
and
stores
of
provisions
and
material
and
tools
and
things
then
we
meet
and
make
connection
with
them
on
the
top
you
see
we
make
the
thing
go
never
fear
and
ship
the
ore
to
south
america
there
millions
to
be
made
out
of
it
what
about
the
other
gentlemen
asked
isak
that
came
up
here
before
what
oh
they
sold
out
so
you
remember
them
no
they
sold
and
the
people
that
bought
them
out
have
sold
again
it
a
big
company
now
that
owns
the
mine
any
amount
of
money
behind
it
and
geissler
where
he
be
now
asks
isak
geissler
never
heard
of
him
who
he
lensmand
geissler
that
sold
you
the
place
first
of
all
oh
him
geissler
was
his
name
heaven
knows
where
he
is
now
so
you
remember
him
too
blasting
and
working
up
in
the
hills
gangs
of
men
at
work
all
through
the
summer
there
was
plenty
doing
about
the
place
inger
did
a
busy
trade
in
milk
and
farm
produce
and
it
amused
her
going
into
business
as
it
were
and
seeing
all
the
many
folk
coming
and
going
isak
tramped
about
with
his
lumbering
tread
and
worked
on
his
land
nothing
disturbed
him
sivert
and
the
two
stoneworkers
got
the
new
cowshed
up
it
was
a
fine
building
but
took
a
deal
of
time
before
it
was
finished
with
only
three
men
to
the
work
and
sivert
moreover
often
called
away
to
help
in
the
fields
the
was
useful
now
and
a
good
thing
too
to
have
three
active
women
that
could
take
a
turn
at
the
haymaking
all
going
well
there
was
life
in
the
wilds
now
and
money
growing
blossoming
everywhere
and
look
at
storborg
the
new
trader
place
there
was
a
business
on
a
proper
scale
this
aron
must
be
a
wizard
a
devil
of
a
fellow
he
had
learned
somehow
beforehand
of
the
mining
operations
to
come
and
was
on
the
spot
all
ready
with
his
shop
and
store
to
make
the
most
of
it
business
he
did
business
enough
for
a
whole
state
ay
enough
for
a
king
to
begin
with
he
sold
all
kinds
of
household
utensils
and
workmen
clothes
but
miners
earning
good
money
are
not
afraid
to
spend
it
not
content
with
buying
necessaries
only
they
would
buy
anything
and
everything
and
most
of
all
on
saturday
evenings
the
trading
station
at
storborg
was
crowded
with
folk
and
aron
raking
money
in
his
clerk
and
his
wife
were
both
called
in
to
help
behind
the
counter
and
aron
himself
serving
and
selling
as
hard
as
he
could
go
at
it
and
even
then
the
place
would
not
be
empty
till
late
at
night
and
the
owners
of
in
the
village
they
were
right
a
mighty
carting
and
hauling
of
wares
up
to
storborg
more
than
once
they
had
to
cut
off
corners
of
the
old
road
and
make
new
short
cuts
a
fine
new
road
it
was
at
last
very
different
from
first
narrow
path
up
through
the
wilds
aron
was
a
blessing
and
a
benefactor
nothing
less
with
his
store
and
his
new
road
his
name
was
not
aron
really
that
being
only
his
christian
name
properly
he
was
aronsen
and
so
he
called
himself
and
his
wife
called
him
the
same
they
were
a
family
not
to
be
looked
down
upon
and
kept
two
and
a
lad
as
for
the
land
at
storborg
it
remained
untouched
for
the
present
aronsen
had
no
time
for
working
on
the
soil
where
was
the
sense
of
digging
up
a
barren
moor
but
aronsen
had
a
garden
with
a
fence
all
round
and
currant
bushes
and
asters
and
rowans
and
planted
trees
ay
a
real
garden
there
was
a
broad
path
down
it
where
aronsen
could
walk
o
sundays
and
smoke
his
pipe
and
in
the
background
was
the
verandah
of
the
house
with
panes
of
coloured
glass
orange
and
red
and
blue
storborg
and
there
were
children
three
pretty
little
things
about
the
place
the
girl
was
to
learn
to
play
her
part
as
daughter
of
a
wealthy
trader
and
the
boys
were
to
learn
the
business
themselves
ay
three
children
with
a
future
before
them
aronsen
was
a
man
to
take
thought
for
the
future
or
he
would
not
have
come
there
at
all
he
might
have
stuck
to
his
fishery
and
like
enough
been
lucky
at
that
and
made
good
money
but
was
not
like
going
into
business
nothing
so
fine
a
thing
for
common
folk
at
best
people
did
take
off
their
hats
to
a
fisherman
aronsen
had
rowed
his
boat
before
pulling
at
the
oars
now
he
was
going
to
sail
instead
there
was
a
word
he
was
always
using
cash
down
he
used
it
all
sorts
of
ways
when
things
went
well
they
were
going
cash
down
his
children
were
to
get
on
in
the
world
and
live
more
cash
down
even
than
himself
that
was
how
he
put
it
meaning
that
they
should
have
an
easier
life
of
it
than
he
had
had
and
look
you
things
did
go
well
neighbours
took
notice
of
him
and
of
his
wife
ay
even
of
the
children
it
was
not
the
least
remarkable
thing
that
folk
took
notice
of
the
children
the
miners
came
down
from
their
work
in
the
hills
and
had
not
seen
a
child
face
for
many
days
when
they
caught
sight
of
aronsen
little
ones
playing
in
the
yard
they
would
talk
kindly
to
them
at
once
as
if
they
had
met
three
puppies
at
play
they
would
have
given
them
money
but
seeing
they
were
the
trader
children
it
would
hardly
do
so
they
played
music
for
them
on
their
instead
young
gustaf
came
down
the
wildest
of
them
all
with
his
hat
over
one
ear
and
his
lips
ever
ready
with
a
merry
word
ay
gustaf
it
was
that
came
and
played
with
them
for
long
at
a
time
the
children
knew
him
every
time
and
ran
to
meet
them
he
would
pick
them
up
and
carry
them
on
his
back
all
three
of
them
and
dance
with
them
ho
said
gustaf
and
danced
with
them
and
then
he
would
take
out
his
and
play
tunes
and
music
for
them
till
the
two
would
come
out
and
look
at
him
and
listen
with
tears
in
their
eyes
ay
a
madcap
was
gustaf
but
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
then
after
a
bit
he
would
go
into
the
shop
and
throw
his
money
about
buying
up
a
whole
knapsack
full
of
things
and
when
he
went
back
up
the
road
again
it
was
with
a
whole
little
of
his
own
and
he
would
stop
at
sellanraa
on
the
way
and
open
his
pack
and
show
them
notepaper
with
a
flower
in
the
corner
and
a
new
pipe
and
a
new
shirt
and
a
fringed
neckerchief
sweets
for
the
womenfolk
and
shiny
things
a
with
a
compass
a
oh
a
host
of
things
ay
there
were
rockets
he
had
bought
to
let
off
on
sunday
for
every
one
to
see
inger
gave
him
milk
and
he
joked
with
leopoldine
and
picked
up
little
rebecca
and
swung
her
up
in
the
air
and
how
the
building
getting
on
he
asked
the
swedes
gustaf
was
a
swede
himself
and
made
friends
with
them
too
the
building
was
getting
on
as
best
it
could
with
but
themselves
to
the
work
why
then
he
come
and
give
them
a
hand
himself
would
gustaf
though
that
was
only
said
in
jest
ay
if
you
only
would
said
inger
for
the
cowshed
ought
to
be
ready
by
the
autumn
when
the
cattle
were
brought
in
gustaf
let
off
a
rocket
and
having
let
off
one
there
was
no
sense
in
keeping
the
rest
as
well
let
them
off
too
and
so
he
did
half
a
dozen
of
them
and
the
women
and
children
stood
round
breathless
at
the
magic
of
the
magician
and
inger
had
never
seen
a
rocket
before
but
the
wild
fire
of
them
somehow
reminded
her
of
the
great
world
she
had
once
seen
what
was
a
to
this
and
when
gustaf
finished
up
by
playing
his
inger
would
have
gone
off
along
the
road
with
him
for
sheer
emotion
the
mine
is
working
now
and
the
ore
is
carted
down
by
teams
of
horses
to
the
sea
a
steamer
had
loaded
up
one
cargo
and
sailed
away
with
it
to
south
america
and
another
steamer
waits
already
for
the
next
load
ay
is
a
big
concern
all
the
settlers
have
been
up
to
look
at
the
wonderful
place
as
many
as
can
walk
brede
olsen
has
been
up
with
his
samples
of
stone
and
got
nothing
for
his
pains
seeing
that
the
mining
expert
was
gone
back
to
sweden
again
on
sundays
there
was
a
crowd
of
people
coming
up
all
the
way
from
the
village
ay
even
axel
str√∂m
who
had
no
time
to
throw
away
turned
off
from
his
proper
road
along
the
telegraph
line
to
look
at
the
place
hardly
a
soul
now
but
has
seen
the
mine
and
its
wonders
and
at
last
inger
herself
inger
from
sellanraa
puts
on
her
best
gold
ring
and
all
and
goes
up
to
the
hills
what
does
she
want
there
nothing
does
not
even
care
to
see
how
the
work
is
done
inger
has
come
to
show
herself
that
is
all
when
she
saw
the
other
women
going
up
she
felt
she
must
go
too
a
disfiguring
scar
on
her
upper
lip
and
grown
children
of
her
own
has
inger
but
she
must
go
as
the
others
did
it
irks
her
to
think
of
the
others
young
women
ay
but
she
will
try
if
she
ca
compete
with
them
all
the
same
she
has
not
begun
to
grow
stout
as
yet
but
has
still
a
good
figure
enough
tall
and
natty
enough
she
can
still
look
well
true
her
colouring
is
not
what
it
used
to
be
and
her
skin
is
not
comparable
to
a
golden
peach
but
they
should
see
for
all
that
ay
they
should
say
after
all
she
was
good
enough
they
greet
her
kindly
as
she
could
wish
the
workmen
know
her
she
has
given
them
many
a
drink
of
milk
and
they
show
her
over
the
mine
the
huts
the
stables
and
kitchens
the
cellars
and
storesheds
the
bolder
men
edge
in
close
to
her
and
take
her
lightly
by
the
arm
but
inger
does
not
feel
hurt
at
all
it
does
her
good
and
where
there
are
steps
to
go
up
or
down
she
lifts
her
skirts
high
showing
her
legs
a
trifle
but
she
manages
it
quietly
as
if
without
a
thought
ay
good
enough
think
the
men
to
themselves
oh
but
there
is
something
touching
about
her
this
woman
getting
on
in
years
plain
to
see
that
a
glance
from
one
of
these
menfolk
came
all
unexpectedly
to
her
she
was
grateful
for
it
and
returned
it
she
was
a
woman
like
other
women
and
it
thrilled
her
to
feel
so
an
honest
woman
she
had
been
but
like
enough
was
for
lack
of
opportunity
getting
on
in
years
gustaf
came
up
left
two
girls
from
the
village
and
a
comrade
just
to
come
gustaf
knew
what
he
was
at
no
doubt
he
took
inger
hand
with
more
warmth
more
pressure
than
was
needed
and
thanked
her
for
the
last
pleasant
evening
at
sellanraa
but
he
was
careful
not
to
plague
her
with
attention
well
gustaf
and
when
are
you
coming
to
help
us
with
the
building
says
inger
going
red
and
gustaf
says
he
will
come
sure
enough
before
long
his
comrades
hear
it
and
put
in
a
word
that
they
all
be
coming
down
before
long
ho
says
inger
are
you
going
to
stay
on
the
mine
then
come
winter
the
men
answer
cautiously
that
it
does
look
like
it
but
ca
be
sure
but
gustaf
is
bolder
and
laughs
and
says
looks
like
scraped
out
the
bit
of
copper
there
was
you
not
say
that
in
earnest
surely
says
inger
and
the
other
men
put
in
that
gustaf
had
better
be
careful
not
to
say
any
such
thing
but
gustaf
was
not
going
to
be
careful
he
said
a
great
deal
more
and
as
for
inger
was
strange
how
he
managed
to
win
her
for
himself
for
all
that
he
never
seemed
to
put
himself
forward
that
way
one
of
the
other
lads
played
a
concertina
but
was
not
like
another
lad
again
and
a
smart
fellow
he
was
too
tried
to
draw
attention
to
himself
by
singing
a
song
off
by
heart
to
the
music
but
that
was
nothing
either
for
all
that
he
had
a
fine
rolling
voice
and
a
little
while
after
there
was
gustaf
and
if
he
got
inger
gold
ring
on
his
little
finger
and
how
had
it
come
about
when
he
never
plagued
nor
pushed
himself
forward
oh
he
was
forward
enough
in
his
way
but
quiet
with
it
all
as
inger
herself
they
did
not
talk
of
things
and
she
let
him
play
with
her
hand
as
if
without
noticing
later
on
when
she
sat
in
one
of
the
huts
drinking
coffee
there
was
a
noise
outside
high
words
between
the
men
and
she
knew
it
was
about
herself
and
it
warmed
her
a
pleasant
thing
to
hear
for
one
no
longer
young
for
a
woman
getting
on
in
years
and
how
did
she
come
home
from
the
hills
that
sunday
evening
ho
well
enough
virtuous
as
she
had
come
no
more
and
no
less
there
was
a
crowd
of
men
to
see
her
home
the
crowd
of
them
that
would
not
turn
back
as
long
as
gustaf
was
there
would
not
leave
her
alone
with
him
not
if
they
knew
it
inger
had
never
had
such
a
gay
time
not
even
in
the
days
when
she
had
been
out
in
the
world
had
inger
lost
something
they
asked
at
last
lost
something
no
a
gold
ring
for
instance
and
at
that
gustaf
had
to
bring
it
out
he
was
one
against
all
a
whole
army
oh
was
a
good
thing
you
found
it
said
inger
and
made
haste
to
say
to
her
escort
she
drew
nearer
sellanraa
saw
the
many
roofs
of
the
buildings
it
was
her
home
that
lay
there
and
she
awoke
once
more
came
back
to
herself
like
the
clever
wife
she
was
and
took
a
short
cut
through
to
the
summer
shed
to
look
to
the
cattle
on
the
way
she
passes
by
a
place
she
knows
a
little
child
had
once
lain
buried
there
she
had
patted
down
the
earth
with
her
hands
set
up
a
tiny
cross
oh
but
it
was
long
ago
now
she
was
wondering
if
those
girls
had
finished
their
milking
in
good
time
the
work
at
the
mine
goes
on
but
there
are
whisperings
of
something
wrong
the
yield
is
not
as
good
as
it
had
promised
the
mining
expert
who
had
gone
back
home
came
out
again
with
another
expert
to
help
him
they
went
about
blasting
and
boring
and
examining
all
the
ground
what
was
wrong
the
copper
is
fine
enough
nothing
wrong
with
that
but
thin
and
no
real
depth
in
it
getting
thicker
to
the
southward
lying
deep
and
fine
just
where
the
company
holding
reached
its
limit
and
beyond
that
was
the
property
of
the
state
well
the
first
purchasers
had
perhaps
not
thought
so
much
of
the
thing
anyway
it
was
a
family
affair
some
relatives
who
had
bought
the
place
as
a
speculation
they
had
not
troubled
to
secure
the
whole
range
all
the
miles
to
the
next
valley
no
they
had
but
taken
over
a
patch
of
ground
from
isak
sellanraa
and
geissler
and
then
sold
it
again
and
what
was
to
be
done
now
the
leading
men
with
the
experts
and
the
foremen
know
well
enough
they
must
start
negotiations
with
the
state
at
once
so
they
send
a
messenger
off
at
full
speed
to
sweden
with
letters
and
plans
and
charts
and
ride
away
themselves
down
to
the
lensmand
below
to
get
the
rights
of
the
fjeld
south
of
the
water
and
here
their
difficulties
begin
the
law
stands
in
their
way
they
are
foreigners
and
can
not
be
purchasers
in
their
own
right
they
knew
all
about
that
and
had
made
arrangements
but
the
southern
side
of
the
fjeld
was
sold
already
and
that
they
did
not
know
sold
ay
long
ago
years
back
who
bought
it
then
geissler
what
geissler
oh
that
fellow
h
and
the
approved
and
registered
says
the
lensmand
was
bare
rock
no
more
and
he
got
it
for
next
to
nothing
who
is
this
fellow
geissler
that
keeps
cropping
up
where
is
he
heaven
knows
where
he
is
now
and
a
new
messenger
is
sent
off
to
sweden
they
must
find
out
all
about
this
geissler
meanwhile
they
could
not
keep
on
all
the
men
they
must
wait
and
see
so
gustaf
came
down
to
sellanraa
with
all
his
worldly
goods
on
his
back
and
here
he
was
he
said
ay
gustaf
had
given
up
his
work
at
the
mine
that
is
to
say
he
had
been
a
trifle
too
outspoken
the
sunday
before
about
the
mine
and
the
copper
in
the
mine
the
foreman
had
heard
of
it
and
the
engineer
and
gustaf
was
given
his
discharge
well
then
and
maybe
was
the
very
thing
he
wanted
there
could
be
nothing
suspicious
now
about
his
coming
to
sellanraa
they
set
him
to
work
at
once
on
the
cowshed
they
worked
and
worked
at
the
stone
walls
and
when
a
few
days
later
another
man
came
down
from
the
mine
he
was
taken
on
too
now
there
were
two
spells
and
the
work
went
apace
ay
they
would
have
it
ready
by
the
autumn
never
fear
but
now
one
after
another
of
the
miners
came
down
dismissed
and
took
the
road
to
sweden
the
trial
working
was
stopped
for
the
present
there
was
something
like
a
sigh
from
the
folk
in
the
village
at
the
news
foolish
folk
they
did
not
understand
what
a
trial
working
was
that
it
was
only
working
on
trial
but
so
it
was
there
were
dark
forebodings
and
discouragement
among
the
village
folk
money
was
scarcer
wages
were
reduced
things
were
very
quiet
at
the
trading
station
at
storborg
what
did
it
all
mean
just
when
everything
was
going
on
finely
and
aronsen
had
got
a
flagstaff
and
a
flag
and
had
bought
a
fine
white
bearskin
for
a
rug
to
have
in
the
sledge
for
the
winter
and
fine
clothes
for
all
the
family
little
matters
these
but
there
were
greater
things
happening
as
well
here
were
two
new
men
had
bought
up
land
for
clearing
in
the
wilds
high
up
between
maaneland
and
sellanraa
and
that
was
no
small
event
for
the
whole
of
that
little
outlying
community
the
two
new
settlers
had
built
their
turf
huts
and
started
clearing
ground
and
digging
they
were
folk
and
had
done
much
in
a
little
time
all
that
summer
they
had
bought
their
provisions
at
storborg
but
when
they
came
down
now
last
time
there
was
hardly
anything
to
be
had
nothing
in
stock
and
what
did
aron
want
with
heavy
stocks
of
this
and
that
now
the
work
at
the
mine
had
stopped
he
had
hardly
anything
of
any
sort
on
the
place
now
only
money
of
all
the
folk
in
the
neighbourhood
aronsen
was
perhaps
the
most
dejected
his
reckoning
was
all
upset
when
some
one
urged
him
to
cultivate
his
land
and
live
on
that
till
better
times
he
answered
cultivate
the
land
was
not
that
i
came
and
set
up
house
here
for
at
last
aronsen
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
must
go
up
to
the
mine
and
see
for
himself
how
things
were
it
was
a
sunday
when
he
got
to
sellanraa
he
wanted
isak
to
go
with
him
but
isak
had
never
yet
set
foot
on
the
mine
since
they
had
started
he
was
more
at
home
on
the
hillside
below
inger
had
to
put
in
a
word
you
might
as
well
go
with
aronsen
when
he
asks
you
she
said
and
maybe
inger
was
not
sorry
to
have
him
go
was
sunday
and
like
as
not
she
wanted
to
be
rid
of
him
for
an
hour
or
so
and
so
isak
went
along
there
were
strange
things
to
be
seen
up
there
in
the
hills
isak
did
not
recognize
the
place
at
all
now
with
its
huts
and
sheds
a
whole
town
of
them
and
carts
and
waggons
and
great
gaping
holes
in
the
ground
the
engineer
himself
showed
them
round
maybe
he
was
not
in
the
best
of
humour
just
now
that
same
engineer
but
he
had
tried
all
along
to
keep
away
the
feeling
of
gloom
that
had
fallen
upon
the
village
folk
and
the
settlers
round
and
here
was
his
chance
with
no
less
persons
than
the
margrave
of
sellanraa
and
the
great
trader
from
storborg
on
the
spot
he
explained
the
nature
of
the
ore
and
the
rocks
in
which
it
was
found
copper
iron
and
sulphur
all
were
there
together
ay
they
knew
exactly
what
there
was
in
the
rocks
up
there
even
gold
and
silver
was
there
though
not
so
much
of
it
a
mining
engineer
he
knows
a
deal
of
things
and
it
all
going
to
shut
down
now
asked
aronsen
shut
down
repeated
the
engineer
in
astonishment
a
nice
thing
that
be
for
south
america
if
we
did
no
they
were
discontinuing
their
preliminary
operations
for
a
while
only
for
a
short
time
they
had
seen
what
the
place
was
like
what
it
could
produce
then
they
could
build
their
aerial
railway
and
get
to
work
on
the
southern
side
of
the
fjeld
he
turned
to
isak
you
do
happen
to
know
where
this
geissler
got
to
no
well
no
matter
they
get
hold
of
him
all
right
and
then
start
to
work
again
shut
down
the
idea
isak
is
suddenly
lost
in
wonder
and
delight
over
a
little
machine
that
works
with
a
treadle
simply
move
your
foot
and
it
works
he
understands
it
at
once
is
a
little
smithy
to
carry
about
on
a
cart
and
take
down
and
set
up
anywhere
you
please
what
a
thing
like
that
cost
now
he
asks
that
portable
forge
oh
nothing
much
they
had
several
of
the
same
sort
it
appeared
but
nothing
to
what
they
had
down
at
the
sea
all
sorts
of
machines
and
apparatus
huge
big
things
isak
was
given
to
understand
that
mining
the
making
of
valleys
and
enormous
chasms
in
the
rock
was
not
a
business
that
could
be
done
with
your
fingernails
ha
ha
they
stroll
about
the
place
and
the
engineer
mentions
that
he
himself
will
be
going
across
to
sweden
in
a
few
days
time
but
you
be
coming
back
again
says
aronsen
why
of
course
knew
of
no
reason
why
the
government
or
the
police
should
try
to
keep
him
isak
managed
to
lead
round
to
the
portable
forge
once
more
and
stopped
looking
at
it
again
and
what
might
a
bit
of
a
machine
like
that
cost
he
asked
cost
could
say
a
deal
of
money
no
doubt
but
nothing
to
speak
of
in
mining
operations
oh
a
grand
fellow
was
the
engineer
not
in
the
best
of
humour
himself
just
then
perhaps
but
he
kept
up
appearances
and
played
up
rich
and
fine
to
the
last
did
isak
want
a
forge
well
he
might
take
that
one
the
company
would
never
trouble
about
a
little
thing
like
that
the
company
would
make
him
a
present
of
a
portable
forge
an
hour
after
aronsen
and
isak
were
on
their
way
down
again
aronsen
something
calmer
in
mind
there
was
hope
after
all
isak
trundles
down
the
hillside
with
his
precious
forge
on
his
back
ay
a
barge
of
a
man
he
could
bear
a
load
the
engineer
had
offered
to
send
a
couple
of
men
down
with
it
to
sellanraa
next
morning
but
isak
thanked
him
was
more
than
worth
his
while
he
was
thinking
of
his
own
folk
be
a
fine
surprise
for
them
to
see
him
come
walking
down
with
a
smithy
on
his
back
but
was
isak
was
surprised
after
all
a
horse
and
cart
turned
into
the
courtyard
just
as
he
reached
home
and
a
highly
remarkable
load
it
brought
the
driver
was
a
man
from
the
village
but
beside
him
walked
a
gentleman
at
whom
isak
stared
in
astonishment
it
was
geissler
chapter
v
there
were
other
things
that
might
have
given
isak
matter
for
surprise
but
he
was
no
great
hand
at
thinking
of
more
than
one
thing
at
a
time
where
inger
was
all
he
said
as
he
passed
by
the
kitchen
door
he
was
only
anxious
to
see
that
geissler
was
well
received
inger
inger
was
out
plucking
berries
had
been
out
plucking
berries
ever
since
isak
started
she
and
gustaf
the
swede
ay
getting
on
in
years
and
all
in
love
again
and
wild
with
it
autumn
and
winter
near
but
she
felt
the
warmth
in
herself
again
flowers
and
blossoming
again
come
and
show
where
there
cloudberries
said
gustaf
cranberries
said
he
and
how
could
a
woman
say
no
inger
ran
into
her
little
room
and
was
both
earnest
and
religious
for
several
minutes
but
there
was
gustaf
standing
waiting
outside
the
world
was
at
her
heels
and
all
she
did
was
to
tidy
her
hair
look
at
herself
carefully
in
the
glass
and
out
again
and
what
if
she
did
who
would
not
have
done
the
same
oh
a
woman
can
not
tell
one
man
from
another
not
always
not
often
and
they
two
go
out
plucking
berries
plucking
cloudberries
on
the
moorland
stepping
from
tuft
to
tuft
and
she
lifts
her
skirts
high
and
has
her
neat
legs
to
show
all
quiet
everywhere
the
white
grouse
have
their
young
ones
grown
already
and
do
not
fly
up
hissing
any
more
they
are
sheltered
spots
where
bushes
grow
on
the
moors
less
than
an
hour
since
they
started
and
already
they
are
sitting
down
to
rest
says
inger
oh
i
did
think
you
were
like
that
oh
she
is
all
weakness
towards
him
and
smiles
piteously
being
so
deep
in
love
ay
a
sweet
and
cruel
thing
to
be
in
love
is
both
right
and
proper
to
be
on
her
guard
ay
but
only
to
give
in
at
last
inger
is
so
deep
in
love
desperately
mercilessly
her
heart
is
full
of
kindliness
towards
him
she
only
cares
to
be
close
and
precious
to
him
ay
a
woman
getting
on
in
years
when
the
work
finished
you
be
going
off
again
says
she
no
he
was
going
well
of
course
some
time
but
not
yet
not
for
a
week
or
so
had
we
better
be
getting
home
says
she
no
they
pluck
more
berries
and
in
a
little
while
they
find
a
sheltered
place
among
the
bushes
and
inger
says
gustaf
you
mad
to
do
it
and
hours
pass
they
be
sleeping
now
belike
among
the
bushes
sleeping
wonderful
far
out
in
the
wilderness
in
the
garden
of
eden
then
suddenly
inger
sits
upright
and
listens
seems
like
i
heard
some
one
down
on
the
road
away
off
the
sun
is
setting
the
tufts
of
heather
darkening
in
shadow
as
they
walk
home
they
pass
by
many
sheltered
spots
and
gustaf
sees
them
and
inger
she
sees
them
too
no
doubt
but
all
the
time
she
feels
as
if
some
one
were
driving
ahead
of
them
oh
but
who
could
walk
all
the
way
home
with
a
wild
handsome
lad
and
be
on
her
guard
all
the
time
inger
is
too
weak
she
can
only
smile
and
say
i
never
knew
such
a
one
she
comes
home
alone
and
well
that
she
came
just
then
a
fortunate
thing
a
minute
later
had
not
been
well
at
all
isak
had
just
come
into
the
courtyard
with
his
forge
and
aronsen
and
there
is
a
horse
and
cart
just
pulled
up
says
geissler
greeting
inger
as
well
and
there
they
stand
all
looking
one
at
another
could
be
better
geissler
back
again
years
now
since
he
was
there
but
he
is
back
again
aged
a
little
greyer
a
little
but
bright
and
cheerful
as
ever
and
finely
dressed
this
time
with
a
white
waistcoat
and
gold
chain
across
a
man
beyond
understanding
had
he
an
inkling
maybe
that
something
was
going
on
up
at
the
mine
and
wanted
to
see
for
himself
well
here
he
was
very
wide
awake
to
look
at
glancing
round
at
the
place
at
the
land
turning
his
head
and
using
his
eyes
every
way
there
are
great
changes
to
note
the
margrave
had
extended
his
domains
and
geissler
nods
what
that
you
carrying
he
asks
isak
is
a
load
for
one
horse
in
itself
says
he
is
for
a
forge
explains
isak
and
a
mighty
useful
thing
to
have
on
a
bit
of
a
farm
says
he
ay
calling
sellanraa
a
bit
of
a
farm
no
more
where
did
you
get
hold
of
it
up
at
the
mine
engineer
he
gave
me
the
thing
for
a
present
he
said
the
company
engineer
says
geissler
as
if
he
had
not
understood
and
geissler
was
he
to
be
outdone
by
an
engineer
on
a
copper
mine
i
heard
you
got
a
says
he
and
i
brought
along
a
patent
raker
thing
that
handy
to
have
and
he
points
to
the
load
on
the
cart
there
it
stood
red
and
blue
a
huge
comb
a
hayrake
to
be
driven
with
horses
they
lifted
it
out
of
the
cart
and
looked
at
it
isak
harnessed
himself
to
the
thing
and
tried
it
over
the
ground
no
wonder
his
mouth
opened
wide
marvel
on
marvel
coming
to
sellanraa
they
spoke
of
the
mine
of
the
work
up
in
the
hills
they
were
asking
about
you
quite
a
lot
said
isak
who
the
engineer
and
all
the
other
gentlemen
to
get
hold
of
you
somehow
they
said
oh
but
here
isak
was
saying
overmuch
it
seemed
geissler
was
offended
no
doubt
he
turned
sharp
and
curt
and
said
well
here
if
they
want
me
next
day
came
the
two
messengers
back
from
sweden
and
with
them
a
couple
of
the
on
horseback
they
were
fine
gentlemen
and
portly
mighty
rich
folk
by
the
look
of
them
they
hardly
stopped
at
sellanraa
at
all
simply
asked
a
question
or
so
about
the
road
without
dismounting
and
rode
on
up
the
hill
geissler
they
pretended
not
to
see
though
he
stood
quite
close
the
messengers
with
their
loaded
packhorses
rested
for
an
hour
talked
to
the
men
at
work
on
the
building
learned
that
the
old
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
and
gold
chain
was
geissler
and
then
they
too
went
on
again
but
that
same
evening
one
of
them
came
riding
down
to
the
place
with
a
message
by
word
of
mouth
for
geissler
to
come
up
to
the
gentlemen
at
the
mines
i
here
if
they
want
me
was
the
answer
geissler
sent
back
geissler
was
grown
an
important
personage
it
seemed
thought
himself
a
man
of
power
of
all
the
power
in
the
world
considered
it
perhaps
beneath
his
dignity
to
be
sent
for
by
word
of
mouth
but
how
was
it
he
had
come
to
sellanraa
at
all
just
then
just
when
he
was
most
wanted
a
great
one
he
must
be
for
knowing
things
all
manner
of
things
anyway
when
the
gentlemen
up
at
the
mine
had
geissler
answer
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
they
must
bestir
themselves
and
come
all
the
way
down
to
sellanraa
again
the
engineer
and
the
two
mining
experts
came
with
them
so
many
crooked
ways
and
turnings
were
there
before
that
meeting
was
brought
about
it
looked
ill
to
start
with
ay
geissler
was
by
far
the
gentlemen
were
polite
enough
this
time
begged
him
to
excuse
their
having
sent
a
verbal
message
the
day
before
being
tired
out
after
their
journey
geissler
was
polite
in
return
and
said
he
too
was
tired
out
after
his
journey
or
he
would
have
come
well
and
then
to
get
to
business
would
geissler
sell
the
land
south
of
the
water
do
you
wish
to
purchase
on
your
own
account
may
i
ask
said
geissler
or
are
you
acting
as
agents
now
this
could
be
nothing
but
sheer
contrariness
on
geissler
part
he
could
surely
see
for
himself
that
rich
and
portly
gentlemen
of
their
stamp
would
not
be
acting
as
agents
they
went
on
to
discuss
terms
what
about
the
price
said
they
the
price
yes
said
geissler
and
sat
thinking
it
over
a
couple
of
million
said
he
indeed
said
the
gentlemen
and
smiled
but
geissler
did
not
smile
the
engineer
and
the
two
experts
had
made
a
rough
investigation
of
the
ground
made
a
few
borings
and
blastings
and
here
was
their
report
the
occurrence
of
ore
was
due
to
eruption
it
was
irregular
and
from
their
preliminary
examination
appeared
to
be
deepest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
boundary
between
the
company
land
and
geissler
decreasing
from
there
onwards
for
the
last
mile
or
so
there
was
no
ore
to
be
found
worth
working
geissler
listened
to
all
this
with
the
greatest
nonchalance
he
took
some
papers
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
them
carefully
but
the
papers
were
not
charts
nor
maps
like
as
not
they
were
things
no
way
connected
with
the
mine
at
all
you
have
gone
deep
enough
said
he
as
if
it
were
something
he
had
read
in
his
papers
the
gentlemen
admitted
that
at
once
but
the
engineer
asked
how
did
he
know
that
you
have
made
borings
yourself
i
suppose
and
geissler
smiled
as
if
he
had
bored
hundreds
of
miles
down
through
the
globe
and
covered
up
the
holes
again
after
they
kept
at
it
till
noon
talking
it
over
this
way
and
that
and
at
last
began
to
look
at
their
watches
they
had
brought
geissler
down
to
half
a
million
now
but
not
a
hair
breadth
farther
no
they
must
have
put
him
out
sorely
some
way
or
other
they
seemed
to
think
he
was
anxious
to
sell
obliged
to
sell
but
he
was
not
ho
not
a
bit
there
he
sat
as
easy
and
careless
as
themselves
and
no
mistaking
it
fifteen
say
twenty
thousand
would
be
a
decent
price
anyway
said
they
geissler
agreed
that
might
be
a
decent
price
enough
for
any
one
sorely
in
need
of
the
money
but
thousand
would
be
better
and
then
one
of
the
gentlemen
put
in
saying
it
perhaps
by
way
of
keeping
geissler
from
soaring
too
far
by
the
way
i
seen
your
wife
people
in
sweden
they
sent
their
kind
regards
thank
you
said
geissler
well
said
the
other
gentleman
seeing
geissler
was
not
to
be
won
over
that
way
a
quarter
of
a
million
it
not
gold
we
buying
but
copper
exactly
said
geissler
it
copper
and
at
that
they
lost
patience
all
of
them
and
five
were
opened
and
snapped
to
again
no
more
time
to
fool
away
now
it
was
time
for
dinner
they
did
not
ask
for
food
at
sellanraa
but
rode
back
to
the
mine
to
get
their
own
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
meeting
geissler
was
left
alone
what
would
be
in
his
mind
all
this
time
what
was
he
pondering
and
speculating
about
nothing
at
all
maybe
but
only
idle
and
careless
no
indeed
he
was
thinking
of
something
but
calm
enough
for
all
that
after
dinner
he
turned
to
isak
and
said
i
going
for
a
long
walk
over
my
land
up
there
and
i
have
liked
to
have
sivert
with
me
same
as
last
time
ay
so
you
shall
said
isak
at
once
no
he
other
things
to
do
just
now
he
shall
go
with
you
at
once
said
isak
and
called
to
sivert
to
leave
his
work
but
geissler
held
up
his
hand
and
said
shortly
no
he
walked
round
the
yard
several
times
came
back
and
talked
to
the
men
at
their
work
chatting
easily
with
them
and
going
off
and
coming
back
again
and
all
the
time
with
this
weighty
matter
on
his
mind
yet
talking
as
if
it
were
nothing
at
all
geissler
had
long
been
so
long
accustomed
to
changes
of
fortune
maybe
he
was
past
feeling
there
was
anything
at
stake
now
whatever
might
be
in
the
air
here
he
was
the
man
he
was
by
the
merest
chance
he
had
sold
the
first
little
patch
of
land
to
his
wife
relations
and
what
then
gone
off
and
bought
up
the
whole
tract
south
of
the
water
what
for
was
it
to
annoy
them
by
making
himself
their
neighbour
at
first
no
doubt
he
had
only
thought
of
taking
over
a
little
strip
of
the
land
there
just
where
the
new
village
would
have
to
be
built
if
the
workings
came
to
anything
but
in
the
end
he
had
come
to
be
owner
of
the
whole
fjeld
the
land
was
to
be
had
for
next
to
nothing
and
he
did
not
want
a
lot
of
trouble
with
boundaries
so
from
sheer
idleness
he
had
become
a
mining
king
a
lord
of
the
mountains
he
had
thought
of
a
site
for
huts
and
machine
sheds
and
it
had
become
a
kingdom
stretching
right
down
to
the
sea
in
sweden
the
first
little
patch
of
land
had
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
geissler
had
taken
care
to
keep
himself
informed
as
to
its
fate
the
first
purchasers
of
course
had
bought
foolishly
bought
without
sense
or
forethought
the
family
council
were
not
mining
experts
they
had
not
secured
enough
land
at
first
thinking
only
of
buying
out
a
certain
geissler
and
getting
rid
of
him
but
the
new
owners
were
no
less
to
be
laughed
at
mighty
men
no
doubt
who
could
afford
to
indulge
in
a
jest
and
take
up
land
for
amusement
sake
for
a
drunken
wager
or
heaven
knows
what
but
when
it
came
to
trial
workings
and
exploiting
the
land
in
earnest
then
suddenly
they
found
themselves
butting
up
against
a
wall
geissler
children
thought
geissler
maybe
in
his
lofty
mind
he
felt
his
power
now
felt
strong
enough
to
be
short
and
abrupt
with
folk
the
others
had
certainly
done
their
best
to
take
him
down
a
peg
they
imagined
they
were
dealing
with
a
man
in
need
of
money
and
threw
out
hints
of
some
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
ay
children
they
did
not
know
geissler
and
now
here
he
stood
they
came
down
no
more
that
day
from
the
fjeld
thinking
best
no
doubt
not
to
show
themselves
next
morning
they
came
down
packhorses
and
all
on
their
way
home
and
lo
geissler
was
not
there
not
there
that
put
an
end
to
any
ideas
they
might
have
had
of
settling
the
manner
in
lordly
wise
from
the
saddle
they
had
to
dismount
and
wait
and
where
was
geissler
if
you
please
nobody
could
tell
them
he
went
about
everywhere
did
geissler
took
an
interest
in
sellanraa
and
all
about
it
the
last
they
had
seen
of
him
was
up
at
the
sawmill
the
messengers
were
sent
out
to
look
for
him
but
geissler
must
have
gone
some
distance
it
seemed
for
he
gave
no
answer
when
they
shouted
the
gentlemen
looked
at
their
watches
and
were
plainly
annoyed
at
first
and
said
we
not
going
to
fool
about
here
waiting
like
this
if
geissler
wants
to
sell
he
must
be
on
the
spot
oh
but
they
changed
their
tone
in
a
little
while
showed
no
annoyance
after
a
while
but
even
began
to
find
something
amusing
in
it
all
to
jest
about
it
here
were
they
in
a
desperate
case
they
would
have
to
lie
out
there
in
the
desolate
hills
all
night
and
get
lost
and
starve
to
death
in
the
wilds
and
leave
their
bones
to
bleach
undiscovered
by
their
mourning
kin
ay
they
made
a
great
jest
of
it
all
at
last
geissler
came
had
been
looking
round
a
bit
just
come
from
the
cattle
enclosure
looks
as
if
that
be
too
small
for
you
soon
said
he
to
isak
how
many
head
have
you
got
up
there
now
altogether
ay
he
could
talk
like
that
with
those
fine
gentlemen
standing
there
watch
in
hand
curiously
red
in
the
face
was
geissler
as
if
he
had
been
drinking
puh
said
he
i
all
hot
walking
we
half
expected
you
would
be
here
when
we
came
said
one
of
the
gentlemen
i
had
no
word
of
your
wanting
to
see
me
at
all
answered
geissler
otherwise
i
might
have
been
here
on
the
spot
well
and
what
about
the
business
now
was
geissler
prepared
to
accept
a
reasonable
offer
today
it
was
every
day
he
had
a
chance
of
fifteen
or
twenty
thousand
what
unless
of
course
if
the
money
were
nothing
to
him
why
then
this
last
suggestion
was
not
to
geissler
taste
at
all
he
was
offended
a
nice
way
to
talk
well
they
would
not
have
said
it
perhaps
if
they
had
not
been
annoyed
at
first
and
geissler
no
doubt
would
hardly
have
turned
suddenly
pale
at
their
words
if
he
had
not
been
out
somewhere
by
himself
and
got
red
as
it
was
he
paled
and
answered
coldly
i
do
wish
to
make
any
suggestion
as
to
what
you
gentlemen
may
be
in
a
position
to
pay
but
i
know
what
i
am
willing
to
accept
and
what
not
i
no
use
for
more
child
prattle
about
the
mine
my
price
is
the
same
as
yesterday
a
quarter
of
a
million
yes
the
gentlemen
mounted
their
horses
look
here
said
one
we
go
this
far
and
say
thousand
you
still
inclined
to
joke
i
see
said
geissler
but
i
make
an
offer
in
sober
earnest
would
you
care
to
sell
your
bit
of
a
mine
up
there
why
said
they
somewhat
taken
aback
why
we
might
do
that
perhaps
i
ready
to
buy
it
said
geissler
oh
that
geissler
with
the
courtyard
full
of
people
now
listening
to
every
word
all
the
sellanraa
folk
and
the
stoneworkers
and
the
messengers
like
as
not
he
could
never
have
raised
the
money
nor
anything
near
it
for
such
a
deal
but
again
who
could
say
a
man
beyond
understanding
was
geissler
anyhow
his
last
words
rather
disconcerted
those
gentlemen
on
horseback
was
it
a
trick
did
he
reckon
to
make
his
own
land
seem
worth
more
by
this
manoeuvre
the
gentlemen
thought
it
over
ay
they
even
began
to
talk
softly
together
about
it
they
got
down
from
their
horses
again
then
the
engineer
put
in
a
word
he
thought
no
doubt
it
was
getting
beyond
all
bearing
and
he
seemed
to
have
some
power
some
kind
of
authority
here
and
the
yard
was
full
of
folk
all
listening
to
what
was
going
on
we
not
sell
said
he
not
asked
his
companions
no
they
whispered
together
again
and
they
mounted
their
horses
once
more
in
earnest
this
time
thousand
called
out
one
of
them
geissler
did
not
answer
but
turned
away
and
went
over
to
talk
to
the
stoneworkers
again
and
that
was
the
end
of
their
last
meeting
geissler
appeared
to
care
nothing
for
what
might
come
of
it
he
walked
about
talking
of
this
that
and
the
other
for
the
moment
he
seemed
chiefly
interested
in
the
laying
of
some
heavy
beams
across
the
shell
of
the
new
cowhouse
they
were
to
get
the
work
finished
that
week
with
a
temporary
roof
a
new
fodder
loft
was
to
be
built
up
over
later
on
isak
kept
sivert
away
from
the
building
work
now
and
left
him
idle
and
this
he
did
with
a
purpose
that
geissler
might
find
the
lad
ready
at
any
time
if
he
wanted
to
go
exploring
with
him
in
the
hills
but
isak
might
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
geissler
had
given
up
the
idea
or
perhaps
forgotten
all
about
it
what
he
did
was
to
get
inger
to
pack
him
up
some
food
and
set
off
down
the
road
he
stayed
away
till
evening
he
passed
the
two
new
clearings
that
had
been
started
below
sellanraa
and
talked
to
the
men
there
went
right
down
to
maaneland
to
see
what
axel
str√∂m
had
got
done
that
year
nothing
very
great
it
seemed
not
as
much
as
he
might
have
wished
but
he
had
put
in
some
good
work
on
the
land
geissler
took
an
interest
in
this
place
too
and
asked
him
got
a
horse
ay
well
i
a
and
a
harrow
down
south
both
new
send
them
up
if
you
like
how
asked
axel
unable
to
conceive
such
magnificence
and
thinking
vaguely
of
payment
by
instalments
i
mean
i
make
you
a
present
of
them
said
geissler
is
hard
to
believe
said
axel
but
you
have
to
help
those
two
neighbours
of
yours
up
above
breaking
new
land
ay
never
fear
for
that
said
axel
he
could
still
hardly
make
out
what
geissler
meant
by
it
all
so
you
machines
and
things
down
south
i
a
deal
of
things
to
look
after
said
geissler
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
geissler
had
no
great
deal
of
things
to
look
after
but
he
liked
to
make
it
appear
so
as
for
a
and
a
harrow
he
could
buy
them
in
any
of
the
towns
and
send
up
from
there
he
stayed
talking
a
long
while
with
axel
str√∂m
about
the
other
settlers
near
of
storborg
the
trading
station
of
axel
brother
newly
married
who
had
come
to
breidablik
and
had
started
draining
the
moors
and
getting
the
water
out
axel
complained
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
a
woman
anywhere
to
help
he
had
none
but
an
old
creature
by
name
oline
not
much
good
at
the
best
of
times
but
he
might
be
thankful
to
have
her
as
long
as
she
stayed
axel
had
been
working
day
and
night
part
of
that
summer
he
might
perhaps
have
got
a
woman
from
his
own
parts
from
helgeland
but
that
would
have
meant
paying
for
her
journey
besides
wages
a
costly
business
all
round
axel
further
told
how
he
had
taken
over
the
inspection
of
the
telegraph
line
but
rather
wished
he
had
left
it
alone
that
sort
of
thing
only
fit
for
brede
and
his
like
said
geissler
ay
that
a
true
word
axel
admitted
but
there
was
the
money
to
think
of
how
many
cows
have
you
got
four
and
a
young
bull
was
too
far
to
go
up
to
sellanraa
to
theirs
but
there
was
a
far
weightier
matter
axel
badly
wanted
to
talk
over
with
geissler
barbro
affair
had
come
to
light
somehow
and
an
investigation
was
in
progress
come
to
light
of
course
it
had
barbro
had
been
going
about
evidently
with
child
and
plain
to
see
and
she
had
left
the
place
by
herself
all
unencumbered
and
no
child
at
all
how
had
it
come
about
when
geissler
understood
what
the
matter
was
he
said
quite
shortly
come
along
with
me
and
he
led
axel
with
him
away
from
the
house
geissler
put
on
an
important
air
as
one
in
authority
they
sat
down
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
geissler
said
now
then
tell
me
all
about
it
come
to
light
of
course
it
had
how
could
it
be
helped
the
place
was
no
longer
a
desert
with
never
a
soul
for
miles
and
moreover
oline
was
there
what
had
oline
to
do
with
it
ho
and
to
make
things
worse
brede
olsen
had
made
an
enemy
of
her
himself
no
means
of
getting
round
oline
now
here
she
was
on
the
spot
and
could
worm
things
out
of
axel
a
bit
at
a
time
was
just
such
underhand
work
she
lived
for
ay
lived
by
in
some
degree
and
here
was
the
very
thing
for
her
trust
oline
for
scenting
it
out
truth
to
tell
oline
was
grown
too
old
now
to
keep
house
and
tend
cattle
at
maaneland
she
ought
to
have
given
it
up
but
how
could
she
how
could
she
leave
a
place
where
a
fine
deep
mystery
lay
simply
waiting
to
be
brought
to
light
she
managed
the
winter
work
ay
she
got
through
the
summer
too
and
it
was
a
marvel
of
strength
she
gained
from
the
mere
thought
of
being
able
one
day
to
show
up
a
daughter
of
brede
himself
the
snow
was
not
gone
from
the
fields
that
spring
before
oline
began
poking
about
she
found
the
little
green
mound
by
the
stream
and
saw
at
once
that
the
turf
had
been
laid
down
in
squares
she
had
even
had
the
luck
to
come
upon
axel
one
day
standing
by
the
little
grave
and
treading
it
down
so
axel
knew
all
about
it
and
oline
nodded
her
grey
head
ay
it
was
her
turn
now
not
but
axel
was
a
kindly
man
enough
to
live
with
but
miserly
counted
his
cheeses
and
kept
good
note
of
every
tuft
of
wool
oline
could
not
do
as
she
liked
with
things
not
by
a
long
way
and
then
that
matter
of
the
accident
last
year
when
she
had
saved
him
if
axel
had
been
the
right
sort
he
would
have
given
her
the
credit
for
it
all
and
acknowledged
his
debt
to
her
alone
but
not
a
bit
of
it
axel
still
held
to
the
division
he
had
made
on
the
spot
ay
he
would
say
if
oline
had
happened
to
come
along
he
would
have
had
to
lie
out
there
in
the
cold
all
night
but
brede
he
been
a
good
help
too
on
the
way
home
and
that
was
all
the
thanks
she
got
oline
was
full
of
indignation
surely
the
lord
almighty
must
turn
away
his
face
from
his
creatures
how
easy
it
would
have
been
for
axel
to
lead
out
a
cow
from
its
stall
and
bring
it
to
her
and
say
here
a
cow
for
you
oline
but
no
not
a
word
of
it
well
let
him
wait
wait
and
see
if
it
might
not
come
to
cost
him
more
than
the
worth
of
a
cow
in
the
end
all
through
that
summer
oline
kept
a
for
every
and
whispered
to
them
and
nodded
and
confided
things
to
them
in
secret
but
never
a
word
i
said
so
she
charged
them
every
time
oline
went
down
to
the
village
too
more
than
once
and
now
there
were
rumours
and
talk
of
things
about
the
place
ay
drifting
like
a
fog
settling
on
faces
and
getting
into
ears
even
the
children
going
to
school
at
breidablik
began
nodding
secrets
among
themselves
and
at
last
the
lensmand
had
to
take
it
up
had
to
bestir
himself
and
report
it
and
ask
for
instructions
then
he
came
up
with
a
book
to
write
in
and
an
assistant
to
help
him
came
up
to
maaneland
one
day
and
investigated
things
and
wrote
things
down
and
went
back
again
but
three
weeks
after
he
came
up
once
more
investigating
and
writing
down
again
and
this
time
he
opened
a
little
green
mound
by
the
stream
and
took
out
the
body
of
a
child
oline
was
an
invaluable
help
to
him
and
in
return
he
had
to
answer
a
host
of
questions
she
put
among
other
things
he
said
yes
it
might
perhaps
come
to
having
axel
arrested
too
at
that
oline
clasped
her
hands
in
dismay
at
all
the
wickedness
she
had
got
mixed
up
with
here
and
only
wished
she
were
out
of
the
place
far
away
from
it
all
but
the
girl
she
whispered
what
about
barbro
herself
the
girl
barbro
said
the
lensmand
she
under
arrest
now
in
bergen
the
law
must
take
its
course
said
he
and
he
took
the
little
body
and
went
back
again
to
the
village
little
wonder
then
that
axel
str√∂m
was
anxious
he
had
spoken
out
to
the
lensmand
and
denied
nothing
he
was
in
part
responsible
for
the
coming
of
the
child
at
all
and
in
addition
he
had
dug
a
grave
for
it
and
now
he
was
asking
geissler
what
he
had
better
do
next
would
he
have
to
go
in
to
the
town
to
a
new
and
worse
examination
and
be
tortured
there
geissler
was
not
the
man
he
had
been
no
and
the
long
story
had
wearied
him
he
seemed
duller
now
whatever
might
be
the
cause
he
was
not
the
bright
and
confident
soul
he
had
been
that
morning
he
looked
at
his
watch
got
up
and
said
this
want
thinking
over
i
go
into
it
thoroughly
and
let
you
know
before
i
leave
and
geissler
went
off
he
came
back
to
sellanraa
that
evening
had
a
little
supper
and
went
to
bed
slept
till
late
next
morning
slept
rested
thoroughly
he
was
tired
no
doubt
after
his
meeting
with
the
swedish
not
till
two
days
after
did
he
make
ready
to
leave
he
was
his
lordly
self
again
by
then
paid
liberally
for
his
keep
and
gave
little
rebecca
a
shining
he
made
a
speech
to
isak
and
said
it
does
matter
in
the
least
if
nothing
came
of
the
deal
this
time
it
come
all
right
later
on
for
the
present
i
going
to
stop
the
working
up
there
and
leave
it
a
bit
as
for
those
fellows
children
thought
they
would
teach
me
did
they
did
you
hear
what
they
offered
me
thousand
ay
said
isak
well
said
geissler
and
waved
his
hand
as
if
dismissing
all
impertinent
offers
of
insignificant
sums
from
his
mind
well
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
the
district
if
i
do
stop
the
working
there
a
bit
on
the
contrary
it
teach
folk
to
stick
to
their
land
but
they
feel
it
in
the
village
they
made
a
pile
of
money
there
last
summer
fine
clothes
and
fine
living
for
all
but
there
an
end
of
that
now
ay
it
might
have
been
worth
their
while
the
good
folks
down
there
to
have
kept
in
with
me
things
might
have
been
different
then
now
it
be
as
i
please
but
for
all
that
he
did
not
look
much
of
a
man
to
control
the
fate
of
villages
as
he
went
away
he
carried
a
parcel
of
food
in
his
hand
and
his
white
waistcoat
was
no
longer
altogether
clean
his
good
wife
might
have
equipped
him
for
the
journey
up
this
time
out
of
the
rest
of
the
forty
thousand
she
had
once
got
who
could
say
perhaps
she
had
anyhow
he
was
going
back
poor
enough
he
did
not
forget
to
look
in
at
axel
str√∂m
on
the
way
down
and
give
the
results
of
his
thinking
over
i
been
looking
at
it
every
way
said
he
the
matter
in
abeyance
for
the
present
so
there
nothing
to
be
done
just
yet
you
be
called
up
for
a
further
examination
and
you
have
to
say
how
things
are
words
nothing
more
geissler
had
probably
never
given
the
matter
a
thought
at
all
and
axel
agreed
dejectedly
to
all
he
said
but
at
last
geissler
flickered
up
into
a
mighty
man
again
puckered
his
brows
and
said
thoughtfully
unless
perhaps
i
could
manage
to
come
to
town
myself
and
watch
the
proceedings
ay
if
you
be
so
good
said
axel
geissler
decided
in
a
moment
i
see
if
i
can
manage
it
if
i
can
get
the
time
but
i
a
heap
of
things
to
look
after
down
south
come
if
i
can
for
now
i
send
you
those
machines
all
right
and
geissler
went
would
he
ever
come
again
chapter
vi
the
rest
of
the
workmen
came
down
from
the
mine
work
is
stopped
the
fjeld
lies
dead
again
the
building
at
sellanraa
too
is
finished
now
there
is
a
makeshift
roof
of
turf
put
on
for
the
winter
the
great
space
beneath
is
divided
into
rooms
bright
apartments
a
great
salon
in
the
middle
and
large
rooms
at
either
end
as
if
it
were
for
human
beings
here
isak
once
lived
in
a
turf
hut
together
with
a
few
goats
there
is
no
turf
hut
to
be
seen
now
at
sellanraa
loose
boxes
mangers
and
bins
are
fitted
up
the
two
stoneworkers
are
still
busy
kept
on
to
get
the
whole
thing
finished
as
soon
as
possible
but
gustaf
is
no
hand
at
woodwork
so
he
says
and
he
is
leaving
gustaf
has
been
a
splendid
lad
at
the
stonework
heaving
and
lifting
like
a
bear
and
in
the
evenings
a
joy
and
delight
to
all
playing
his
not
to
speak
of
helping
the
womenfolk
carrying
heavy
pails
to
and
from
the
river
but
he
is
going
now
no
gustaf
is
no
hand
at
woodwork
so
he
says
it
looks
almost
as
if
he
were
in
a
hurry
to
get
away
ca
it
wait
till
tomorrow
says
inger
no
it
ca
wait
he
no
more
work
to
do
here
and
besides
going
now
he
will
have
company
across
the
hills
going
over
with
the
last
gang
from
the
mines
and
who
to
help
me
with
my
buckets
now
says
inger
smiling
sadly
but
gustaf
is
never
at
a
loss
he
has
his
answer
ready
and
says
hjalmar
now
hjalmar
was
the
younger
of
the
two
stoneworkers
but
neither
of
them
was
young
as
gustaf
himself
none
like
him
in
any
way
hjalmar
huh
says
inger
contemptuously
then
suddenly
she
changes
her
tone
and
turns
to
gustaf
thinking
to
make
him
jealous
though
after
all
he
nice
to
have
on
the
place
is
hjalmar
says
she
and
so
prettily
he
sings
and
all
do
think
much
of
him
anyway
says
gustaf
he
does
not
seem
jealous
in
the
least
but
you
might
stay
one
more
night
at
least
no
gustaf
could
stay
one
more
night
he
was
going
across
with
the
others
ay
maybe
gustaf
was
getting
tired
of
the
game
by
now
was
a
fine
thing
to
snap
her
up
in
front
of
all
the
rest
and
have
her
for
his
own
the
few
weeks
he
was
there
but
he
was
going
elsewhere
now
like
as
not
to
a
sweetheart
at
home
he
had
other
things
in
view
was
he
to
stay
on
loafing
about
here
for
the
sake
of
her
he
had
reason
enough
for
bringing
the
thing
to
an
end
as
she
herself
must
know
but
she
was
grown
so
bold
so
thoughtless
of
any
consequence
she
seemed
to
care
for
nothing
no
things
had
not
held
for
so
very
long
between
them
but
long
enough
to
last
out
the
spell
of
his
work
there
inger
is
sad
and
enough
ay
so
erringly
faithful
that
she
mourns
for
him
is
hard
for
her
she
is
honestly
in
love
without
any
thought
of
vanity
or
conquest
and
not
ashamed
no
she
is
a
strong
woman
full
of
weakness
she
is
but
following
the
law
of
nature
all
about
her
it
is
the
glow
of
autumn
in
her
as
in
all
things
else
her
breast
heaves
with
feeling
as
she
packs
up
food
for
gustaf
to
take
with
him
no
thought
of
whether
she
has
the
right
of
whether
she
dare
risk
this
or
that
she
gives
herself
up
to
it
entirely
hungry
to
taste
to
enjoy
isak
might
lift
her
up
to
the
roof
and
thrust
her
to
the
floor
again
ay
what
of
that
it
would
not
make
her
feel
the
less
she
goes
out
with
the
parcel
to
gustaf
now
she
had
set
the
bucket
by
the
steps
on
purpose
in
case
he
should
care
to
go
with
her
to
the
river
just
once
more
maybe
she
would
like
to
say
something
to
give
him
some
little
thing
her
gold
ring
heaven
knows
she
was
in
a
state
to
do
anything
but
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
some
time
gustaf
thanks
her
says
and
goes
and
there
she
stands
hjalmar
she
calls
out
aloud
oh
so
much
louder
than
she
need
as
if
she
were
determined
to
be
gay
in
spite
of
all
or
crying
out
in
distress
gustaf
goes
on
his
way
all
through
that
autumn
there
was
the
usual
work
in
the
fields
all
round
right
away
down
to
the
village
potatoes
to
be
taken
up
corn
to
be
got
in
the
horned
cattle
let
loose
over
the
ground
eight
farms
there
are
now
and
all
are
busy
but
at
the
trading
station
at
storborg
there
are
no
cattle
and
no
green
lands
only
a
garden
and
there
is
no
trade
there
now
and
nothing
for
any
to
be
busy
about
there
they
have
a
new
root
crop
at
sellanraa
called
turnips
sending
up
a
colossal
growth
of
green
waving
leaves
out
of
the
earth
and
nothing
can
keep
the
cows
away
from
them
the
beasts
break
down
all
hedgework
and
storm
in
bellowing
nothing
for
it
but
to
set
leopoldine
and
little
rebecca
to
keep
guard
over
the
turnip
fields
and
little
rebecca
walks
about
with
a
big
stick
in
her
hand
and
is
a
wonder
at
driving
cows
away
her
father
is
at
work
close
by
now
and
again
he
comes
up
to
feel
her
hands
and
feet
and
ask
if
she
is
cold
leopoldine
is
big
and
grown
up
now
she
can
knit
stockings
and
mittens
for
the
winter
while
she
is
watching
the
herds
born
in
trondhjem
was
leopoldine
and
came
to
sellanraa
five
years
old
but
the
memory
of
a
great
town
with
many
people
and
of
a
long
voyage
on
a
steamer
is
slipping
away
from
her
now
growing
more
and
more
distant
she
is
a
child
of
the
wilds
and
knows
nothing
now
of
the
great
world
beyond
the
village
down
below
where
she
has
been
to
church
once
or
twice
and
where
she
was
confirmed
the
year
before
and
the
little
casual
work
of
every
day
goes
on
with
this
thing
and
that
to
be
done
beside
as
for
instance
the
road
down
below
that
is
getting
bad
one
or
two
places
the
ground
is
still
workable
and
isak
goes
down
one
day
with
sivert
ditching
and
draining
the
road
there
are
two
patches
of
bog
to
be
drained
axel
str√∂m
has
promised
to
take
part
in
the
work
seeing
that
he
has
a
horse
and
uses
the
road
himself
but
axel
had
pressing
business
in
the
town
just
then
heaven
knows
what
it
could
be
but
very
pressing
he
said
it
was
but
he
had
asked
his
brother
from
breidablik
to
work
with
them
in
his
stead
fredrik
was
this
brother
name
a
young
man
newly
married
a
fellow
who
could
make
a
jest
but
none
the
worse
for
that
sivert
and
he
are
something
alike
now
fredrik
had
looked
in
at
storborg
on
his
way
up
that
morning
aronsen
of
storborg
being
his
nearest
neighbour
and
he
is
full
of
all
the
trader
has
been
telling
him
it
began
this
way
fredrik
wanted
a
roll
of
tobacco
i
give
you
a
roll
of
tobacco
when
i
have
one
said
aronsen
what
you
no
tobacco
in
the
place
no
nor
wo
order
any
there
nobody
to
buy
it
what
think
i
make
out
of
one
roll
of
tobacco
ay
aronsen
had
been
in
a
nasty
humour
that
morning
sure
enough
felt
he
had
been
cheated
somehow
by
that
swedish
mining
concern
here
had
he
set
up
a
store
out
in
the
wilds
and
then
they
go
and
shut
down
the
work
altogether
fredrik
smiles
slyly
at
aronsen
and
makes
fun
of
him
now
he
not
so
much
as
touched
that
land
of
his
says
he
and
has
even
feed
for
his
beasts
but
must
go
and
buy
it
asked
me
if
i
any
hay
to
sell
no
i
no
hay
to
sell
mean
you
do
want
to
make
money
said
aronsen
thinks
money
everything
in
the
world
seems
like
puts
down
a
note
on
the
counter
and
says
money
well
enough
says
i
down
says
he
ay
he
just
a
little
bit
touched
that
way
so
to
speak
and
his
wife
she
goes
about
with
a
watch
and
chain
and
all
on
weekdays
lord
he
knows
what
can
be
she
so
set
on
remembering
to
the
minute
says
sivert
did
aronsen
say
anything
about
a
man
named
geissler
ay
said
something
about
he
be
wanting
to
sell
some
land
got
and
aronsen
was
wild
about
it
he
was
that
used
to
be
lensmand
and
got
turned
out
he
said
and
as
not
without
so
much
as
a
five
in
his
books
and
ought
to
be
shot
but
wait
a
bit
says
i
maybe
he
sell
after
all
says
aronsen
you
believe
it
i
a
business
man
says
he
i
know
when
one
party
puts
up
a
price
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
and
the
other
offers
thousand
there
too
big
a
difference
there
be
no
deal
ever
come
out
of
that
well
let
go
their
own
way
and
see
what
comes
of
it
says
he
only
wish
never
set
my
foot
in
this
hole
and
a
poor
thing
it
been
for
me
and
mine
then
i
asked
him
if
he
did
think
of
selling
out
himself
says
he
just
what
i
thinking
of
this
bit
of
bogland
says
he
hole
and
a
desert
i
not
making
a
single
the
whole
day
now
says
he
they
laughed
at
aronsen
and
had
no
pity
for
him
at
all
think
he
sell
out
asks
isak
well
he
did
speak
of
it
and
he
got
rid
of
the
lad
he
had
already
ay
a
curious
man
a
queer
sort
of
man
that
aronsen
is
sure
sends
away
his
lad
could
be
working
on
the
place
getting
in
winter
fuel
and
carting
hay
with
that
horse
of
his
but
keeps
on
his
storeman
chief
clerk
he
calls
him
is
true
enough
as
he
says
not
selling
so
much
as
a
all
day
for
he
no
stock
in
the
place
at
all
and
what
does
he
want
with
a
chief
clerk
then
i
doubt
it
be
just
by
way
of
looking
grand
and
making
a
show
must
have
a
man
there
to
stand
at
a
desk
and
write
up
things
in
books
ha
ha
ha
ay
looks
like
he
just
a
little
bit
touched
that
way
is
aronsen
the
three
men
worked
till
noon
ate
food
from
their
baskets
and
talked
a
while
they
had
matters
of
their
own
to
talk
over
matters
of
good
and
ill
to
folk
on
the
land
no
trifles
to
them
but
things
to
be
discussed
warily
they
are
folk
their
nerves
unworn
and
not
flying
out
where
they
should
not
it
is
the
autumn
season
now
a
silence
in
the
woods
all
round
the
hills
are
there
the
sun
is
there
and
at
evening
the
moon
and
the
stars
will
come
all
regular
and
certain
full
of
kindliness
an
embrace
men
have
time
to
rest
here
to
lie
in
the
heather
with
an
arm
for
a
pillow
fredrik
talks
of
breidablik
how
is
but
little
he
got
done
there
yet
awhile
nay
says
isak
is
none
so
little
already
i
saw
when
i
was
down
that
way
this
was
praise
from
the
oldest
among
them
the
giant
himself
and
fredrik
might
well
be
pleased
he
asks
frankly
enough
did
you
think
so
now
well
it
be
better
before
long
i
had
a
deal
of
things
to
hinder
this
year
the
house
to
do
up
being
leaky
and
like
to
fall
to
pieces
hayloft
to
take
down
and
put
up
again
and
no
sort
of
room
in
the
turf
hut
for
beasts
seeing
i
cow
and
heifer
more
than
brede
he
ever
had
in
his
time
says
fredrik
proudly
and
you
thriving
like
up
here
asks
isak
ay
i
not
say
no
and
wife
she
thriving
too
why
should
we
there
good
room
and
outlook
all
about
we
can
see
up
and
down
the
road
both
ways
and
a
neat
little
copse
by
the
house
all
pretty
to
look
at
birch
and
willow
i
plant
a
bit
more
other
side
of
the
house
when
i
time
and
it
fine
to
see
how
the
bogland
dried
only
since
last
year
ditching
is
all
a
question
now
what
grow
on
her
this
year
ay
thrive
when
we
house
and
home
and
land
and
all
is
enough
for
the
two
of
us
surely
ho
says
sivert
slyly
and
the
two
of
you
is
that
all
there
ever
to
be
why
as
to
that
says
fredrik
bravely
is
like
enough
be
more
to
come
and
as
to
thriving
well
the
wife
not
falling
off
anyway
by
the
looks
of
her
they
work
on
until
evening
drawing
up
now
and
again
to
straighten
their
backs
and
exchange
a
word
or
so
and
so
you
did
get
the
tobacco
says
sivert
no
that
true
but
was
no
loss
for
i
no
use
for
it
anyway
says
fredrik
no
use
for
tobacco
nay
was
but
for
to
drop
in
at
aronsen
like
and
hear
what
got
to
say
and
the
two
jesters
laughed
together
at
that
on
the
way
home
father
and
son
talk
little
as
was
their
way
but
isak
must
have
been
thinking
out
something
for
himself
he
says
sivert
ay
says
sivert
again
nay
was
nothing
they
walk
on
a
good
ways
and
isak
begins
again
how
he
get
on
then
with
his
trading
aronsen
when
he
nothing
to
trade
with
nay
says
sivert
but
there
not
folk
enough
here
now
for
him
to
buy
for
ho
you
think
so
why
i
suppose
is
so
ay
well
sivert
wondered
a
little
at
this
after
a
while
his
father
went
on
again
there
but
eight
places
now
in
all
but
there
might
be
more
before
long
more
well
i
do
know
sivert
wondering
more
than
ever
what
can
his
father
be
getting
at
the
pair
of
them
walk
on
a
long
way
in
silence
they
are
nearly
home
now
h
says
isak
what
you
think
aronsen
he
ask
for
that
place
of
his
now
ho
that
it
says
sivert
want
to
buy
it
do
you
he
asks
jestingly
but
suddenly
he
understands
what
it
all
means
is
eleseus
the
old
man
has
in
mind
oh
he
not
forgotten
him
after
all
but
kept
him
faithfully
in
mind
just
as
his
mother
only
in
his
own
way
nearer
earth
and
nearer
to
sellanraa
be
going
for
a
reasonable
price
i
doubt
says
sivert
and
when
sivert
says
so
much
his
father
knows
the
lad
has
read
his
thought
and
as
if
in
fear
of
having
spoken
out
too
clearly
he
falls
to
talking
of
their
a
good
thing
they
had
got
it
done
at
last
for
a
couple
of
days
after
that
sivert
and
his
mother
were
putting
their
heads
together
and
holding
councils
and
whispering
ay
they
even
wrote
a
letter
and
when
saturday
came
round
sivert
suddenly
wanted
to
go
down
to
the
village
what
you
want
to
go
down
village
again
for
now
said
his
father
in
displeasure
wearing
boots
to
rags
oh
isak
was
more
bitter
than
need
be
he
knew
well
enough
that
sivert
was
going
to
the
post
going
to
church
says
sivert
was
all
he
could
find
by
way
of
excuse
and
his
father
muttered
well
what
you
want
to
go
for
but
if
sivert
was
going
to
church
why
he
might
harness
up
and
take
little
rebecca
with
him
little
rebecca
ay
surely
she
might
have
that
bit
of
a
treat
for
once
in
her
life
after
being
so
clever
guarding
turnips
and
being
all
ways
the
pearl
and
blessing
of
them
all
ay
that
she
was
and
they
harnessed
up
and
rebecca
had
the
maid
jensine
to
look
after
her
on
the
way
and
sivert
said
never
a
word
against
that
either
while
they
are
away
it
so
happens
that
aronsen
man
his
chief
clerk
from
storborg
comes
up
the
road
what
does
this
mean
why
nothing
very
much
is
only
andresen
the
chief
clerk
from
storborg
come
up
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
this
way
his
master
having
sent
him
nothing
more
and
no
great
excitement
among
the
folk
at
sellanraa
over
that
was
not
as
in
the
old
days
when
a
stranger
was
a
rare
sight
on
their
new
land
and
inger
made
a
great
no
inger
grown
quieter
now
and
keeps
to
herself
these
days
a
strange
thing
that
book
of
devotion
a
guide
upon
the
way
an
arm
round
one
neck
no
less
when
inger
had
lost
hold
of
herself
a
little
lost
her
way
a
little
out
plucking
berries
she
found
her
way
home
again
by
the
thought
of
her
little
chamber
and
the
holy
book
ay
she
was
humble
now
and
a
godfearing
soul
she
can
remember
long
years
ago
when
she
would
say
an
evil
word
if
she
pricked
her
finger
sewing
so
she
had
learned
to
do
from
her
round
the
big
table
in
the
institute
but
now
she
pricks
her
finger
and
it
bleeds
and
she
sucks
the
blood
away
in
silence
is
no
little
victory
gained
to
change
one
nature
so
and
inger
did
more
than
that
when
all
the
workmen
were
gone
and
the
stone
building
was
finished
and
sellanraa
was
all
forsaken
and
still
then
came
a
critical
time
for
inger
she
cried
a
deal
and
suffered
much
she
blamed
none
but
herself
for
it
all
and
she
was
deeply
humbled
if
only
she
could
have
spoken
out
to
isak
and
relieved
her
mind
but
that
was
not
their
way
at
sellanraa
there
was
none
of
them
would
talk
their
feelings
and
confess
things
all
she
could
do
was
to
be
extra
careful
in
the
way
she
asked
her
husband
to
come
in
to
meals
going
right
up
to
him
to
say
it
nicely
instead
of
shouting
from
the
door
and
in
the
evenings
she
looked
over
his
clothes
and
sewed
buttons
on
ay
and
even
more
she
did
one
night
she
lifted
up
on
her
elbow
and
said
isak
what
is
it
says
isak
are
you
awake
ay
nay
was
nothing
says
inger
but
i
not
been
all
as
i
ought
what
says
isak
ay
so
much
he
said
and
rose
up
on
his
elbow
in
turn
they
lay
there
and
went
on
talking
inger
is
a
matchless
woman
after
all
and
with
a
full
heart
i
not
been
as
i
ought
towards
you
she
says
and
i
that
sorry
about
it
the
simple
words
move
him
this
barge
of
a
man
is
touched
ay
he
wants
to
comfort
her
knowing
nothing
of
what
is
the
matter
but
only
that
there
is
none
like
her
naught
to
cry
about
my
dear
says
isak
there
none
of
us
can
be
as
we
ought
nay
is
true
she
answers
gratefully
oh
isak
had
a
strong
sound
way
of
taking
things
straightened
them
out
he
did
when
they
turned
crooked
none
of
us
can
be
as
we
ought
ay
he
was
right
the
god
of
the
heart
for
all
that
he
is
a
god
he
goes
a
deal
of
crooked
ways
goes
out
adventuring
the
wild
thing
that
he
is
and
we
can
see
it
in
his
looks
one
day
rolling
in
a
bed
of
roses
and
licking
his
lips
and
remembering
things
next
day
with
a
thorn
in
his
foot
desperately
trying
to
get
it
out
die
of
it
never
a
bit
he
as
well
as
ever
a
nice
it
would
be
if
he
were
to
die
and
inger
trouble
passed
off
too
she
got
over
it
but
she
keeps
on
with
her
hours
of
devotion
and
finds
a
merciful
refuge
there
and
patient
and
good
she
is
now
every
day
knowing
isak
different
from
all
other
men
and
wanting
none
but
him
no
gay
young
spark
of
a
singer
true
in
his
looks
and
ways
but
good
enough
ay
good
enough
indeed
and
once
more
it
is
seen
that
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
contentment
therewith
are
a
precious
gain
and
now
it
was
that
the
little
chief
clerk
from
storborg
andresen
came
up
to
sellanraa
one
sunday
and
inger
was
not
in
the
least
affected
far
from
it
she
did
not
so
much
as
go
in
herself
to
give
him
a
mug
of
milk
but
sent
leopoldine
in
with
it
by
reason
that
jensine
the
maid
was
out
and
leopoldine
could
carry
a
mug
of
milk
as
well
as
need
be
and
she
gave
it
him
and
said
here
you
are
and
blushed
for
all
she
was
wearing
her
sunday
clothes
and
had
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
anyway
thanks
is
overkind
of
you
says
andresen
is
your
father
at
home
says
he
ay
he
be
about
the
place
somewhere
andresen
drank
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
a
handkerchief
and
looked
at
the
time
is
it
far
up
to
the
mines
he
asked
no
is
an
hour
walk
or
hardly
that
i
going
up
to
look
over
them
see
for
him
aronsen
i
his
chief
clerk
ho
you
know
me
yourself
no
doubt
i
aronsen
chief
clerk
been
down
buying
things
at
our
place
before
ay
and
i
remember
you
well
enough
says
andresen
you
been
down
twice
buying
things
is
more
than
could
be
thought
you
remember
that
says
leopoldine
and
had
no
more
strength
after
that
but
stood
holding
by
a
chair
but
andresen
had
strength
enough
he
went
on
and
said
remember
you
well
of
course
i
should
and
he
said
more
you
would
like
to
walk
up
to
the
mine
with
me
said
he
and
a
little
after
something
went
wrong
with
leopoldine
eyes
everything
turned
red
and
strange
about
her
and
the
floor
was
slipping
away
from
under
and
chief
clerk
andresen
was
talking
from
somewhere
ever
so
far
off
saying
could
you
spare
the
time
no
says
she
and
heaven
knows
how
she
managed
to
get
out
of
the
kitchen
again
her
mother
looked
at
her
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
nothing
said
leopoldine
nothing
no
of
course
but
now
look
you
was
leopoldine
turn
to
be
affected
to
begin
the
same
eternal
round
she
was
well
fitted
for
the
same
overgrown
and
pretty
and
newly
confirmed
an
excellent
sacrifice
she
would
make
a
bird
is
fluttering
in
her
young
breast
her
long
hands
are
like
her
mother
full
of
tenderness
full
of
sex
could
she
dance
ay
indeed
she
could
a
marvel
where
she
had
managed
to
learn
it
but
learn
it
they
did
at
sellanraa
as
well
as
elsewhere
sivert
could
dance
and
leopoldine
too
a
kind
of
dancing
peculiar
to
the
spot
growth
of
the
soil
a
dance
with
energy
and
swing
schottische
mazurka
waltz
and
polka
in
one
and
could
not
leopoldine
deck
herself
out
and
fall
in
love
and
dream
by
daylight
all
awake
ay
as
well
as
any
other
the
day
she
stood
in
church
she
was
allowed
to
borrow
her
mother
gold
ring
to
wear
no
sin
in
that
only
neat
and
nice
and
the
day
after
going
to
her
communion
she
did
not
get
the
ring
on
till
it
was
over
ay
she
might
well
show
herself
in
church
with
a
gold
ring
on
her
finger
being
the
daughter
of
a
great
man
on
the
place
the
margrave
when
andresen
came
down
from
the
mine
he
found
isak
at
sellanraa
and
they
asked
him
in
gave
him
dinner
and
a
cup
of
coffee
all
the
folk
on
the
place
were
in
there
together
now
and
took
part
in
the
conversation
andresen
explained
that
his
master
aronsen
had
sent
him
up
to
see
how
things
were
at
the
mines
if
there
was
any
sign
of
beginning
work
there
again
soon
heaven
knows
maybe
andresen
sat
there
lying
all
the
time
about
being
sent
by
his
master
he
might
just
as
well
have
hit
on
it
for
his
own
account
and
anyway
he
could
have
been
at
the
mines
at
all
in
the
little
time
he
been
away
is
none
so
easy
to
see
from
outside
if
they
going
to
start
work
again
said
isak
no
andresen
admitted
that
was
so
but
aronsen
had
sent
him
and
after
all
two
pair
of
eyes
could
see
better
than
one
but
here
inger
seemingly
could
contain
herself
no
longer
she
asked
is
it
true
what
they
saying
aronsen
is
going
to
sell
his
place
again
andresen
answers
he
thinking
of
it
and
a
man
like
him
can
surely
do
as
he
likes
seeing
all
the
means
and
riches
he
got
ho
is
he
so
rich
then
ay
says
andresen
nodding
his
head
rich
enough
and
that
a
true
word
again
inger
can
not
keep
silence
but
asks
right
out
i
wonder
now
what
he
be
asking
for
the
place
isak
puts
in
a
word
here
like
as
not
he
more
curious
to
know
than
inger
herself
but
it
must
not
seem
that
the
idea
of
buying
storborg
is
any
thought
of
his
he
makes
himself
a
stranger
to
it
and
says
now
why
what
you
want
to
know
for
inger
i
was
but
asking
says
she
and
both
of
them
look
at
andresen
waiting
and
he
answers
answers
cautiously
enough
that
as
to
the
price
he
can
say
nothing
of
that
but
he
knows
what
aronsen
says
the
place
has
cost
him
and
how
much
is
that
asks
inger
having
no
strength
to
keep
her
peace
and
be
silent
is
sixteen
hundred
says
andresen
ho
and
inger
claps
her
hands
at
once
to
hear
it
for
if
there
is
one
thing
womenfolk
have
no
sense
nor
thought
of
is
the
price
of
land
and
properties
but
anyway
sixteen
hundred
is
no
small
sum
for
folk
in
the
wilds
and
inger
has
but
one
fear
that
isak
may
be
frightened
off
the
deal
but
isak
he
sits
there
just
exactly
like
a
fjeld
and
says
only
ay
it
the
big
houses
he
put
up
ay
says
andresen
again
is
just
that
is
the
fine
big
houses
and
all
just
when
andresen
is
making
ready
to
go
leopoldine
slips
out
by
the
door
a
strange
thing
but
somehow
she
can
not
bring
herself
to
think
of
shaking
hands
with
him
so
she
has
found
a
good
place
standing
in
the
new
cowshed
looking
out
of
a
window
and
with
a
blue
silk
ribbon
round
her
neck
that
she
had
been
wearing
before
and
a
wonder
she
ever
found
time
to
put
it
on
now
there
he
goes
a
trifle
short
and
stout
spry
on
his
feet
with
a
light
full
beard
eight
or
ten
years
older
than
herself
ay
none
so
to
her
mind
and
then
the
party
came
back
from
church
late
on
sunday
night
all
had
gone
well
little
rebecca
had
slept
the
last
few
hours
of
the
way
up
and
was
lifted
from
the
cart
and
carried
indoors
without
waking
sivert
has
heard
a
deal
of
news
but
when
his
mother
asks
well
what
you
got
to
tell
he
only
says
nay
nothing
much
axel
he
got
a
and
a
harrow
what
that
says
his
father
all
interested
did
you
see
them
ay
i
saw
them
right
enough
down
on
the
quay
ho
so
that
was
what
he
must
go
in
to
town
for
says
his
father
and
sivert
sits
there
swelling
with
pride
at
knowing
better
but
says
never
a
word
his
father
might
just
as
well
believe
that
axel
pressing
business
in
the
town
had
been
to
buy
machines
his
mother
too
might
think
so
for
all
that
ho
but
there
was
neither
of
them
thought
so
in
their
hearts
they
had
heard
whispers
enough
of
what
was
the
matter
of
a
new
case
in
the
wilds
time
for
bed
says
his
father
at
last
sivert
goes
off
to
bed
swelling
with
knowledge
axel
had
been
summoned
for
examination
was
a
big
affair
the
lensmand
had
gone
with
him
so
big
indeed
that
the
lensmand
lady
who
had
just
had
another
child
had
left
the
baby
and
was
gone
in
to
town
with
her
husband
she
had
promised
to
put
in
a
word
to
the
jury
herself
gossip
and
scandal
all
abroad
in
the
village
now
and
sivert
saw
well
enough
that
a
certain
earlier
crime
of
the
same
sort
was
being
called
to
mind
again
outside
the
church
the
groups
would
stop
talking
as
he
came
up
and
had
he
not
been
the
man
he
was
perhaps
some
would
have
turned
away
from
him
good
to
be
sivert
those
days
a
man
from
a
big
place
to
begin
with
son
of
a
wealthy
landowner
and
then
beside
to
be
known
as
a
clever
fellow
a
good
worker
he
ranked
before
others
and
was
looked
up
to
for
himself
sivert
had
always
been
well
liked
among
folk
if
only
jensine
did
not
learn
too
much
before
they
got
home
that
day
and
sivert
had
his
own
affairs
to
think
of
ay
folk
in
the
wilds
can
blush
and
pale
as
well
as
other
he
had
seen
jensine
as
she
left
the
church
with
little
rebecca
she
had
seen
him
too
but
went
by
he
waited
a
bit
and
then
drove
over
to
the
smith
to
fetch
them
they
were
sitting
at
table
all
the
family
at
dinner
sivert
is
asked
to
join
them
but
has
had
his
dinner
thanks
they
knew
he
would
be
coming
they
might
have
waited
that
bit
of
a
while
for
him
so
they
would
have
done
at
sellanraa
but
not
here
it
seemed
nay
is
not
what
you
used
to
i
dare
say
says
the
wife
and
what
news
from
church
says
the
smith
for
all
he
had
been
at
church
himself
when
jensine
and
little
rebecca
were
seated
up
in
the
cart
again
says
the
smith
wife
to
her
daughter
well
jensine
be
wanting
you
home
again
soon
and
that
could
be
taken
two
ways
thought
sivert
but
he
said
nothing
if
the
speech
had
been
more
direct
more
plain
and
outspoken
he
might
perhaps
he
waits
with
puckered
brows
but
no
more
is
said
they
drive
up
homeward
and
little
rebecca
is
the
only
one
with
a
word
to
say
she
is
full
of
the
wonder
of
going
to
church
the
priest
in
his
dress
with
a
silver
cross
and
the
lights
and
the
organ
music
after
a
long
while
jensine
says
is
a
shameful
thing
about
barbro
and
all
what
did
your
mother
mean
about
you
coming
home
soon
asked
sivert
what
she
meant
ay
you
thinking
of
leaving
us
then
why
they
be
wanting
me
home
some
time
i
doubt
says
she
says
sivert
stopping
his
horse
like
me
to
drive
back
with
you
now
perhaps
jensine
looks
at
him
he
is
pale
as
death
no
says
she
and
a
little
after
she
begins
to
cry
rebecca
looks
in
surprise
from
one
to
the
other
oh
but
little
rebecca
was
a
good
one
to
have
on
a
journey
like
that
she
took
jensine
part
and
patted
her
and
made
her
smile
again
and
when
little
rebecca
looked
threateningly
at
her
brother
and
said
she
was
going
to
jump
down
and
find
a
big
stick
to
beat
him
sivert
had
to
smile
too
but
what
did
mean
now
i
like
to
know
says
jensine
sivert
answered
straight
out
at
once
i
meant
if
you
do
care
to
stay
with
us
why
we
must
manage
without
and
a
long
while
after
said
jensine
well
there
leopoldine
big
now
and
fit
and
all
to
do
my
work
seems
ay
was
a
sorrowful
journey
chapter
vii
a
man
walks
up
the
way
through
the
hills
wind
and
rain
the
autumn
downpour
has
begun
but
the
man
cares
little
for
that
he
looks
glad
at
heart
and
glad
he
is
is
axel
str√∂m
coming
back
from
the
town
and
the
court
and
all
they
have
let
him
go
free
ay
a
happy
man
first
of
all
there
a
and
a
harrow
for
him
down
at
the
quay
and
more
than
that
he
free
and
not
guilty
had
taken
no
part
in
the
killing
of
a
child
ay
so
things
can
turn
out
but
the
times
he
had
been
through
standing
there
as
a
witness
this
toiler
in
the
fields
had
known
the
hardest
days
of
his
life
was
no
gain
to
him
to
make
barbro
guilt
seem
greater
and
for
that
reason
he
was
careful
not
to
say
too
much
he
did
not
even
say
all
he
knew
every
word
had
to
be
dragged
out
of
him
and
he
answered
mostly
with
but
yes
and
no
was
it
not
enough
was
he
to
make
more
of
it
than
there
was
already
oh
but
there
were
times
when
it
looked
serious
indeed
there
were
the
men
of
law
and
dangerous
easy
enough
for
them
it
seemed
just
with
a
word
or
so
to
turn
the
whole
thing
as
they
pleased
and
have
him
sentenced
but
they
were
kindly
folk
after
all
and
did
not
try
to
bring
him
to
destruction
also
as
it
happened
there
were
powerful
influences
at
work
trying
to
save
barbro
and
it
was
all
to
his
advantage
as
well
then
what
on
earth
was
there
for
him
to
trouble
about
barbro
herself
would
hardly
try
to
make
things
look
worse
than
need
be
for
her
former
master
and
lover
he
knew
terrible
things
about
this
and
an
earlier
affair
of
the
same
sort
she
could
not
be
such
a
fool
no
barbro
was
clever
enough
she
said
a
good
word
for
axel
and
declared
that
he
had
known
nothing
of
her
having
borne
a
child
till
after
it
was
all
over
he
was
different
in
some
ways
perhaps
from
other
men
and
they
did
not
always
get
on
well
together
but
a
quiet
man
and
a
good
man
in
every
way
no
it
was
true
he
had
dug
a
new
grave
and
buried
the
body
away
there
but
that
was
long
after
and
by
reason
he
had
thought
the
first
place
was
not
dry
enough
though
indeed
it
was
and
was
only
axel
odd
way
of
thinking
what
need
then
for
axel
to
fear
at
all
when
barbro
took
all
the
blame
on
herself
that
way
and
as
for
barbro
herself
there
were
mighty
influences
at
work
fru
lensmand
heyerdahl
had
taken
up
the
case
she
went
about
to
high
and
low
never
sparing
herself
demanded
to
be
called
as
a
witness
and
made
a
speech
in
court
when
her
turn
came
she
stood
there
before
them
all
and
was
a
great
lady
indeed
she
took
up
the
question
of
infanticide
in
all
its
aspects
and
gave
the
court
a
long
harangue
on
the
subject
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
had
obtained
permission
beforehand
to
say
what
she
pleased
ay
folk
might
say
what
they
would
of
fru
lensmand
heyerdahl
but
make
a
speech
that
she
could
and
was
learned
in
politics
and
social
questions
no
doubt
about
that
was
a
marvel
where
she
found
all
her
words
now
and
again
the
presiding
justice
seemed
wishful
to
keep
her
to
the
point
but
maybe
he
had
not
the
heart
to
interrupt
and
let
her
run
on
and
at
the
end
of
it
all
she
volunteered
one
or
two
useful
items
of
information
and
made
a
startling
offer
to
the
court
leaving
out
all
legal
technicalities
what
took
place
was
this
we
women
said
fru
heyerdahl
we
are
an
unfortunate
and
oppressed
moiety
of
humanity
it
is
the
men
who
make
the
laws
and
we
women
have
not
a
word
to
say
in
the
matter
but
can
any
man
put
himself
in
the
position
of
a
woman
in
childbirth
has
he
ever
felt
the
dread
of
it
ever
known
the
terrible
pangs
ever
cried
aloud
in
the
anguish
of
that
hour
in
the
present
instance
it
is
a
who
has
borne
the
child
a
girl
unmarried
and
consequently
trying
all
through
the
critical
time
to
hide
her
condition
and
why
must
she
seek
to
hide
it
because
of
society
society
despises
the
unmarried
woman
who
bears
a
child
not
only
does
society
offer
her
no
protection
but
it
persecutes
her
pursues
her
with
contempt
and
disgrace
atrocious
no
human
creature
with
any
heart
at
all
could
help
feeling
indignant
at
such
a
state
of
things
not
only
is
the
girl
to
bring
a
child
into
the
world
a
thing
in
itself
surely
hard
enough
but
she
is
to
be
treated
as
a
criminal
for
that
very
fact
i
will
venture
to
say
that
it
was
well
for
the
unfortunate
girl
now
accused
before
the
court
that
her
child
was
born
by
accident
when
she
fell
into
the
water
and
drowned
well
for
herself
and
for
the
child
as
long
as
society
maintains
its
present
attitude
an
unmarried
mother
should
be
counted
guiltless
even
if
she
does
kill
her
child
here
a
slight
murmur
was
heard
from
the
presiding
justice
or
at
any
rate
her
punishment
should
be
merely
nominal
said
fru
heyerdahl
we
are
all
agreed
of
course
she
went
on
that
infant
life
should
be
preserved
but
is
that
to
mean
that
no
law
of
simple
humanity
is
to
apply
to
the
unfortunate
mother
think
consider
what
she
has
been
through
during
all
the
period
of
pregnancy
what
suffering
she
has
endured
in
striving
to
hide
her
condition
and
all
the
time
never
knowing
where
to
turn
for
herself
and
the
child
when
it
comes
no
man
can
imagine
it
said
she
the
child
is
at
least
killed
in
kindness
the
mother
tries
to
save
herself
and
the
child
she
loves
from
the
misery
of
its
life
the
shame
is
more
than
she
can
bear
and
so
the
plan
gradually
forms
itself
in
her
mind
to
put
the
child
out
of
the
way
the
birth
takes
place
in
secret
and
the
mother
is
for
hours
in
such
a
delirious
state
that
at
the
moment
of
killing
the
child
she
is
simply
not
responsible
for
her
actions
practically
speaking
she
has
not
herself
committed
the
act
at
all
being
out
of
her
senses
at
the
time
with
every
bone
in
her
body
aching
still
after
her
delivery
she
has
to
take
the
little
life
and
hide
away
the
body
think
what
an
effort
of
will
is
demanded
here
naturally
we
all
wish
all
children
to
live
we
are
distressed
at
the
thought
that
any
should
be
exterminated
in
such
a
way
but
it
is
the
fault
of
society
that
it
is
so
the
fault
of
a
hopeless
merciless
scandalmongering
mischievous
and
society
ever
on
the
watch
to
crush
an
unmarried
mother
by
every
means
in
its
power
but
even
after
such
treatment
at
the
hands
of
society
the
persecuted
mother
can
rise
up
again
it
often
happens
that
these
girls
after
one
false
step
of
the
sort
are
led
by
that
very
fact
to
develop
their
best
and
noblest
qualities
let
the
court
inquire
of
the
superintendents
at
refuge
homes
where
unmarried
mothers
and
their
children
are
received
if
this
is
not
the
case
and
experience
has
shown
that
it
is
just
such
girls
who
have
whom
society
has
forced
to
kill
their
own
children
that
make
the
best
nurses
surely
that
was
a
matter
for
any
and
all
to
think
seriously
about
then
there
is
another
side
of
the
question
why
is
the
man
to
go
free
the
mother
found
guilty
of
infanticide
is
thrust
into
prison
and
tortured
but
the
father
the
seducer
he
is
never
touched
yet
being
as
he
is
the
cause
of
the
child
existence
he
is
a
party
to
the
crime
his
share
in
it
indeed
is
greater
than
the
mother
had
it
not
been
for
him
there
would
have
been
no
crime
then
why
should
he
be
acquitted
because
the
laws
are
made
by
men
there
is
the
answer
the
enormity
of
such
laws
cries
of
itself
to
heaven
for
intervention
and
there
can
be
no
help
for
us
women
till
we
are
allowed
a
say
in
the
elections
and
in
the
making
of
laws
ourselves
but
said
fru
heyerdahl
if
this
is
the
terrible
fate
that
is
meted
out
to
the
guilty
or
let
us
say
the
more
clearly
guilty
unmarried
mother
who
has
killed
her
child
what
of
the
innocent
one
who
is
merely
suspected
of
the
crime
and
has
not
committed
it
what
reparation
does
society
offer
to
her
none
at
all
i
can
testify
that
i
know
the
girl
here
accused
have
known
her
since
she
was
a
child
she
has
been
in
my
service
and
her
father
is
my
husband
assistant
we
women
venture
to
think
and
feel
directly
in
opposition
to
accusations
and
persecution
we
dare
to
have
our
own
opinion
the
girl
there
has
been
arrested
deprived
of
her
liberty
on
suspicion
of
having
in
the
first
place
concealed
the
birth
of
a
child
and
further
of
having
killed
the
child
so
born
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind
that
she
is
not
guilty
of
either
the
court
will
itself
arrive
at
this
conclusion
concealment
of
birth
the
child
was
born
in
the
middle
of
the
day
true
the
mother
is
alone
at
the
time
but
who
could
have
been
with
her
in
any
case
the
place
is
far
away
in
the
wilds
the
only
living
soul
within
reach
is
a
man
how
could
she
send
for
a
man
at
such
a
moment
any
woman
will
tell
you
it
is
impossible
not
to
be
thought
of
and
then
it
is
alleged
that
she
must
have
killed
the
child
after
but
the
child
was
born
in
the
water
the
mother
falls
down
in
an
icy
stream
and
the
child
is
born
what
was
she
doing
by
the
water
she
is
a
a
slave
that
is
to
say
and
has
her
daily
work
to
do
she
is
going
to
fetch
juniper
twigs
for
cleaning
and
crossing
the
stream
she
slips
and
falls
in
and
there
she
lies
the
child
is
born
and
is
drowned
in
the
water
fru
heyerdahl
stopped
she
could
see
from
the
look
of
the
court
and
the
spectators
that
she
had
spoken
wonderfully
well
there
was
a
great
silence
in
the
place
only
barbro
sat
dabbing
her
eyes
now
and
again
for
sheer
emotion
and
fru
heyerdahl
closed
with
these
words
we
women
have
some
heart
some
feeling
i
have
left
my
own
children
in
the
care
of
strangers
to
travel
all
this
way
and
appear
as
a
witness
on
behalf
of
the
unfortunate
girl
sitting
there
men
laws
can
not
prevent
women
from
thinking
and
i
think
this
that
the
girl
there
has
been
punished
sufficiently
for
no
crime
acquit
her
let
her
go
free
and
i
will
take
charge
of
her
myself
she
will
make
the
best
nurse
i
have
ever
had
and
fru
heyerdahl
stepped
down
says
the
justice
then
but
i
think
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
best
nurses
were
those
who
killed
their
children
oh
but
the
justice
was
not
of
a
mind
to
go
against
fru
heyerdahl
not
in
the
least
he
was
as
humane
as
could
be
himself
a
man
as
gentle
as
a
priest
when
the
advocate
for
the
crown
put
a
few
questions
to
the
witness
afterwards
the
justice
sat
for
the
most
part
making
notes
on
some
papers
the
proceedings
lasted
only
till
a
little
over
noon
there
were
few
witnesses
and
the
case
was
clear
enough
axel
str√∂m
sat
hoping
for
the
best
then
suddenly
it
seemed
as
if
the
advocate
for
the
crown
and
fru
heyerdahl
were
joining
forces
to
make
things
awkward
for
him
because
he
had
buried
the
body
instead
of
notifying
the
death
he
was
somewhat
sharply
on
this
point
and
would
likely
enough
have
come
out
badly
if
he
had
not
all
at
once
caught
sight
of
geissler
sitting
in
the
court
ay
was
right
enough
geissler
was
there
this
gave
axel
courage
he
no
longer
felt
himself
alone
against
the
law
that
was
determined
to
beat
him
down
and
geissler
nodded
to
him
ay
geissler
was
come
to
town
he
had
not
asked
to
be
called
as
a
witness
but
he
was
there
he
had
also
spent
a
couple
of
days
before
the
case
came
on
in
going
into
the
matter
himself
and
noting
down
what
he
remembered
of
axel
own
account
given
him
at
maaneland
most
of
the
documents
seemed
to
geissler
somewhat
unsatisfactory
this
lensmand
heyerdahl
was
evidently
a
person
who
had
throughout
endeavoured
to
prove
complicity
on
axel
part
fool
idiot
of
a
man
what
did
he
know
of
life
in
the
wilds
when
he
could
see
that
the
child
was
just
what
axel
had
counted
on
to
keep
the
woman
his
helpmeet
on
the
place
geissler
spoke
to
the
advocate
for
the
crown
but
it
seemed
there
was
little
need
of
intervention
there
he
wanted
to
help
axel
back
to
his
farm
and
his
land
but
axel
was
in
no
need
of
help
from
the
looks
of
things
for
the
case
was
going
well
as
far
as
barbro
herself
was
concerned
and
if
she
were
acquitted
then
there
could
be
no
question
of
any
complicity
at
all
it
would
depend
on
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
when
the
few
witnesses
had
been
heard
oline
had
not
been
summoned
but
only
the
lensmand
axel
himself
the
experts
a
couple
of
girls
from
the
village
when
they
had
been
heard
it
was
time
to
adjourn
for
the
midday
break
and
geissler
went
up
to
the
advocate
for
the
crown
once
more
the
advocate
was
of
opinion
that
all
was
going
well
for
the
girl
barbro
and
so
much
the
better
fru
lensmand
heyerdahl
words
had
carried
great
weight
all
depended
now
upon
the
finding
of
the
court
are
you
at
all
interested
in
the
girl
asked
the
advocate
why
to
a
certain
extent
answered
geissler
or
rather
perhaps
in
the
man
has
she
been
in
your
service
too
no
he
never
been
in
my
service
i
was
speaking
of
the
girl
it
she
that
has
the
sympathy
of
the
court
no
she
never
been
in
my
service
at
all
the
man
h
he
does
seem
to
come
out
of
it
so
well
said
the
advocate
goes
off
and
buries
the
body
all
by
himself
in
the
wood
looks
bad
very
bad
he
wanted
to
have
it
buried
properly
i
suppose
said
geissler
it
had
been
really
buried
at
all
at
first
well
of
course
a
woman
had
the
strength
of
a
man
to
go
digging
and
in
her
state
she
must
have
been
done
up
already
altogether
said
the
advocate
i
think
we
come
to
take
a
more
humane
view
of
these
infanticide
cases
generally
of
late
if
i
were
to
judge
i
should
never
venture
to
condemn
the
girl
at
all
and
from
what
has
appeared
in
this
case
i
shall
not
venture
to
demand
a
conviction
very
pleased
to
hear
it
said
geissler
with
a
bow
the
advocate
went
on
as
a
man
as
a
private
person
i
will
even
go
further
and
say
i
would
never
condemn
a
single
unmarried
mother
for
killing
her
child
most
interesting
said
geissler
to
find
the
advocate
for
the
crown
so
entirely
in
agreement
with
what
fru
heyerdahl
said
before
the
court
oh
fru
heyerdahl
still
to
my
mind
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
she
said
after
all
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
convictions
unmarried
mothers
have
suffered
enough
beforehand
and
been
brought
so
low
in
every
human
regard
by
the
brutal
and
callous
attitude
of
the
world
the
punishment
ought
to
suffice
geissler
rose
and
said
at
last
no
doubt
but
what
about
the
children
true
said
the
advocate
it
a
sad
business
about
the
children
still
all
things
considered
perhaps
it
just
as
well
illegitimate
children
have
a
hard
time
and
turn
out
badly
as
often
as
not
geissler
felt
perhaps
some
touch
of
malice
at
the
portly
complacency
of
the
man
of
law
he
said
erasmus
was
born
out
of
wedlock
erasmus
erasmus
of
rotterdam
h
and
leonardo
the
same
leonardo
da
vinci
really
well
of
course
there
are
exceptions
otherwise
there
would
be
no
rule
but
on
the
whole
we
pass
protective
measures
for
beast
and
bird
said
geissler
seems
rather
strange
does
it
not
to
trouble
about
our
own
young
the
advocate
for
the
crown
reached
out
slowly
and
with
dignity
after
some
papers
on
the
table
as
a
hint
that
he
had
not
time
to
continue
the
discussion
yes
said
he
absently
yes
yes
no
doubt
geissler
expressed
his
thanks
for
a
most
instructive
conversation
and
took
his
leave
he
sat
down
in
the
again
to
be
there
in
good
time
he
was
not
maybe
to
feel
his
power
he
had
knowledge
of
a
certain
piece
of
wrapping
a
man
shirt
cut
across
to
carry
let
us
say
twigs
for
a
broom
of
the
body
of
a
child
floating
in
the
harbour
at
bergen
ay
he
could
make
matters
awkward
for
the
court
if
he
chose
a
word
from
him
would
be
as
effective
as
a
thousand
swords
but
geissler
had
doubtless
no
intention
of
uttering
that
word
now
unless
it
were
needed
things
were
going
splendidly
without
even
the
advocate
for
the
crown
had
declared
himself
on
the
side
of
the
accused
the
room
fills
and
the
court
is
sitting
again
an
interesting
comedy
to
watch
in
a
little
town
the
warning
gravity
of
the
advocate
for
the
crown
the
emotional
eloquence
of
the
advocate
for
the
defence
the
court
sat
listening
to
what
appeared
to
be
its
duty
in
regard
to
the
case
of
a
girl
named
barbro
and
the
death
of
her
child
for
all
that
it
was
no
light
matter
after
all
to
decide
the
advocate
for
the
crown
was
a
presentable
man
to
look
at
and
doubtless
also
a
man
of
heart
but
something
appeared
to
have
annoyed
him
recently
or
possibly
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
he
held
a
certain
office
in
the
state
and
was
bound
to
act
from
that
point
of
view
an
incomprehensible
thing
but
he
was
plainly
less
disposed
to
be
lenient
now
than
he
had
been
during
the
morning
if
the
crime
had
been
committed
he
said
it
was
a
serious
matter
and
things
would
look
black
indeed
if
they
could
with
certainty
be
declared
so
black
as
would
appear
from
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
already
heard
that
was
a
matter
for
the
court
to
decide
he
wished
to
draw
attention
to
three
points
firstly
whether
they
had
before
them
a
concealment
of
birth
whether
this
was
clear
to
the
court
he
made
some
personal
remarks
on
this
head
the
second
point
was
the
wrapping
the
piece
of
a
shirt
why
had
the
accused
taken
this
with
her
was
it
in
order
to
make
use
of
it
for
a
certain
purpose
preconceived
he
developed
this
suggestion
further
his
third
point
was
the
hurried
and
suspicious
burial
without
any
notification
of
the
death
to
either
priest
or
lensmand
here
the
man
was
the
person
chiefly
responsible
and
it
was
of
the
utmost
importance
that
the
court
should
come
to
the
right
conclusion
in
that
respect
for
it
was
obvious
that
if
the
man
were
an
accomplice
and
had
therefore
undertaken
the
burial
himself
then
his
must
have
committed
a
crime
before
he
could
be
an
accomplice
in
it
h
from
some
one
in
court
axel
str√∂m
felt
himself
again
in
danger
he
looked
up
without
meeting
a
single
glance
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
advocate
speaking
but
far
down
in
the
court
sat
geissler
again
looking
highly
supercilious
as
if
bursting
with
his
own
superiority
his
thrust
forward
his
face
turned
towards
the
ceiling
this
enormous
indifference
to
the
solemnity
of
the
court
and
that
h
uttered
loudly
and
without
concealment
cheered
axel
mightily
he
felt
himself
no
longer
alone
against
the
world
and
now
things
took
a
turn
again
for
the
better
this
advocate
for
the
crown
seemed
at
last
to
think
he
had
done
enough
had
achieved
all
that
was
possible
in
the
way
of
directing
suspicion
and
towards
the
man
and
now
he
stopped
he
did
more
he
almost
as
it
were
faced
round
and
made
no
demand
for
a
conviction
he
ended
by
saying
in
so
many
words
that
after
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
in
the
case
he
on
his
part
did
not
call
upon
the
court
to
convict
the
accused
this
was
well
enough
thought
axel
the
business
was
practically
over
then
came
the
turn
of
the
advocate
for
the
defence
a
young
man
who
had
studied
the
law
and
had
now
been
entrusted
with
this
most
satisfactory
case
his
tone
itself
showed
the
view
he
took
of
it
never
had
a
man
been
more
certain
of
defending
an
innocent
person
than
he
truth
to
tell
this
fru
heyerdahl
had
taken
the
wind
out
of
his
sails
beforehand
and
used
several
of
his
own
intended
arguments
that
morning
he
was
annoyed
at
her
having
already
exploited
the
society
theme
oh
but
he
could
have
said
some
things
about
society
himself
he
was
incensed
at
the
mistaken
leniency
of
the
presiding
justice
in
not
stopping
her
speech
it
was
a
defence
in
itself
a
brief
prepared
beforehand
and
what
was
there
left
for
him
he
began
at
the
beginning
of
the
of
the
girl
barbro
her
people
were
not
well
off
albeit
industrious
and
respectable
she
had
gone
out
to
service
at
an
early
age
first
of
all
to
the
lensmand
the
court
had
heard
that
morning
what
her
mistress
fru
heyerdahl
thought
of
her
no
one
could
wish
for
a
finer
recommendation
barbro
had
then
gone
to
bergen
here
the
advocate
laid
great
stress
on
a
most
feelingly
written
testimonial
from
two
young
business
men
in
whose
employ
barbro
had
been
while
at
bergen
evidently
in
a
position
of
trust
barbro
had
come
back
to
act
as
housekeeper
for
this
unmarried
man
in
an
outlying
district
and
here
her
trouble
began
she
found
herself
with
child
by
this
man
the
learned
counsel
for
the
prosecution
had
already
referred
in
the
most
delicate
and
considerate
manner
be
it
said
to
the
question
of
concealment
of
birth
had
barbro
attempted
to
conceal
her
condition
had
she
denied
being
with
child
the
two
witnesses
girls
from
her
own
village
had
been
of
opinion
that
she
was
in
that
condition
but
when
they
had
asked
her
she
had
not
denied
it
at
all
she
had
merely
passed
the
matter
off
what
would
a
young
girl
naturally
do
in
such
a
case
but
pass
it
off
no
one
else
had
asked
her
about
it
at
all
go
to
her
mistress
and
confess
she
had
no
mistress
she
was
mistress
on
the
place
herself
she
had
a
master
certainly
but
a
girl
could
not
be
expected
to
confide
in
a
man
upon
such
a
matter
she
bears
her
cross
herself
does
not
sing
does
not
whisper
but
is
silent
as
a
trappist
concealment
no
but
she
kept
herself
to
herself
the
child
is
born
a
sound
and
healthy
boy
had
lived
and
breathed
after
birth
but
had
been
suffocated
the
court
had
been
made
aware
of
the
circumstances
attending
this
birth
it
had
taken
place
in
the
water
the
mother
falls
into
the
stream
and
the
child
is
born
but
she
is
incapable
of
saving
the
child
she
lies
there
unable
even
to
rise
herself
till
some
time
after
no
marks
of
violence
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
body
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
had
been
intentionally
killed
it
had
been
drowned
by
misadventure
at
birth
that
was
all
the
most
natural
explanation
in
the
world
his
learned
colleague
had
made
some
mention
of
a
cloth
or
wrapping
considering
it
something
of
a
mystery
why
she
should
have
taken
half
a
shirt
with
her
that
day
the
mystery
was
clear
enough
she
had
taken
the
shirt
to
carry
stripped
juniper
in
she
might
have
taken
let
us
say
a
as
it
was
she
had
taken
this
piece
of
shirt
something
she
must
have
in
any
case
she
could
not
carry
the
stuff
back
in
her
hands
no
there
was
surely
no
ground
for
making
a
mystery
of
this
one
point
however
was
not
quite
so
clear
had
the
accused
been
treated
with
the
care
and
consideration
which
her
condition
at
the
time
demanded
had
her
master
dealt
kindly
with
her
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
if
it
were
found
so
the
girl
herself
had
under
referred
to
the
man
in
satisfactory
terms
and
this
again
was
evidence
in
itself
of
her
own
nobility
of
character
the
man
on
his
part
axel
str√∂m
had
likewise
in
his
depositions
refrained
from
any
attempt
to
add
to
the
burden
of
the
girl
or
to
blame
her
in
any
way
in
this
he
had
acted
rightly
not
to
say
wisely
seeing
that
his
own
case
depended
very
largely
upon
how
matters
went
with
her
by
laying
the
blame
on
her
he
would
if
she
were
convicted
bring
about
his
own
downfall
it
was
impossible
to
consider
the
documents
and
depositions
in
the
present
case
without
feeling
the
deepest
sympathy
for
this
young
girl
in
her
forsaken
situation
and
yet
there
was
no
need
to
appeal
to
mercy
on
her
behalf
only
to
justice
and
human
understanding
she
and
her
master
were
in
a
way
betrothed
but
a
certain
dissimilarity
of
temperament
and
interests
prevented
them
from
marrying
the
girl
could
not
entrust
her
future
to
such
a
man
it
was
not
a
pleasant
subject
but
it
might
be
well
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
wrapping
that
had
been
spoken
of
before
it
should
here
be
noted
that
the
girl
had
taken
not
one
of
her
own
undergarments
but
one
of
her
master
shirts
the
question
at
once
arose
had
the
man
himself
offered
the
material
for
the
purpose
here
one
was
at
first
inclined
to
see
a
possibility
at
any
rate
that
the
man
axel
had
had
some
part
in
the
affair
h
from
some
one
in
court
loud
and
hard
so
much
so
indeed
that
the
speaker
paused
and
all
looked
round
to
see
who
might
be
responsible
for
the
interruption
the
presiding
justice
frowned
but
went
on
the
advocate
for
the
defence
collecting
himself
again
in
this
respect
also
we
can
set
our
minds
at
rest
thanks
to
the
accused
herself
it
might
seem
well
to
her
advantage
to
divide
the
blame
here
but
she
had
not
attempted
to
do
so
she
had
entirely
and
without
reserve
absolved
axel
str√∂m
from
any
complicity
whatever
in
the
fact
of
her
having
taken
his
shirt
instead
of
something
of
her
own
on
her
way
to
the
water
that
is
on
her
way
to
the
woods
to
gather
juniper
there
was
not
the
slightest
reason
for
doubting
the
asseveration
of
the
accused
on
this
point
her
depositions
had
throughout
been
found
in
accordance
with
the
facts
and
the
same
was
evidently
the
case
in
this
had
the
shirt
been
given
her
by
the
man
this
would
have
been
to
presuppose
a
killing
of
the
child
already
planned
the
accused
truthful
as
she
was
had
not
attempted
to
charge
even
this
man
with
a
crime
that
had
never
been
committed
her
demeanour
throughout
had
been
commendably
frank
and
open
she
had
made
no
endeavour
to
throw
the
blame
on
others
there
were
frequent
instances
before
the
court
of
this
delicacy
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
accused
as
for
instance
the
fact
that
she
had
wrapped
up
the
body
of
the
child
as
well
as
she
could
and
put
it
away
decently
as
the
lensmand
had
found
it
here
the
presiding
justice
interposed
merely
as
a
matter
of
form
observing
that
it
was
grave
no
which
the
lensmand
had
found
the
grave
in
which
axel
had
buried
the
body
after
its
removal
from
the
first
true
that
is
true
i
stand
corrected
said
the
advocate
with
all
proper
respect
for
the
president
of
the
court
perfectly
true
but
axel
had
himself
stated
that
he
had
only
carried
the
body
from
one
grave
and
laid
it
in
the
other
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
a
woman
was
better
able
to
wrap
up
a
child
than
was
a
man
and
who
best
of
all
surely
a
mother
tender
hand
the
presiding
justice
nods
in
any
case
could
not
this
girl
if
she
had
been
of
another
sort
have
buried
the
child
naked
one
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
she
might
have
thrown
it
into
a
dustbin
she
might
have
left
it
out
under
a
tree
in
the
open
to
freeze
to
death
that
is
to
say
of
course
if
it
had
not
been
dead
already
she
might
have
put
it
in
the
oven
when
left
alone
and
burnt
it
up
she
might
have
taken
it
up
to
the
river
at
sellanraa
and
thrown
it
in
there
but
this
mother
did
none
of
these
things
she
wrapped
the
dead
child
neatly
in
a
cloth
and
buried
it
and
if
the
body
had
been
found
wrapped
neatly
when
the
grave
was
opened
it
must
be
a
woman
and
not
a
man
who
had
so
wrapped
it
and
now
the
advocate
for
the
defence
went
on
it
lay
with
the
court
to
determine
what
measure
of
guilt
could
properly
be
attributed
to
the
girl
barbro
in
the
matter
there
was
but
little
remaining
for
which
she
could
be
blamed
at
all
indeed
in
his
counsel
opinion
there
was
nothing
unless
the
court
found
reason
to
convict
on
the
charge
of
having
failed
to
notify
the
death
but
here
again
the
child
was
dead
and
nothing
could
alter
that
the
place
was
far
out
in
the
wilds
many
miles
from
either
priest
or
lensmand
natural
enough
surely
to
let
it
sleep
the
eternal
sleep
in
a
neat
grave
in
the
woods
and
if
it
were
a
crime
to
have
buried
it
thus
then
the
accused
was
not
more
guilty
than
the
father
of
the
child
as
it
was
the
misdemeanour
was
surely
slight
enough
to
be
overlooked
modern
practice
was
growing
more
and
more
disposed
to
lay
more
stress
on
reforming
the
criminal
than
on
punishing
the
crime
it
was
an
antiquated
system
which
sought
to
inflict
punishment
for
every
mortal
thing
it
was
the
of
the
old
testament
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
there
was
no
longer
the
spirit
of
the
law
in
modern
times
the
law
of
the
present
day
was
more
humane
seeking
to
adjust
itself
according
to
the
degree
of
criminal
intent
and
purpose
displayed
in
each
case
no
the
court
could
never
convict
this
girl
it
was
not
the
object
of
a
trial
to
secure
an
addition
to
the
number
of
criminals
but
rather
to
restore
to
society
a
good
and
useful
member
it
should
be
noted
that
the
accused
had
now
the
prospect
of
a
new
position
where
she
would
be
under
the
best
possible
supervision
fru
lensmand
heyerdahl
had
from
her
intimate
knowledge
of
the
girl
and
from
her
own
valuable
experience
as
a
mother
thrown
wide
the
doors
of
her
own
home
to
the
girl
the
court
would
bear
in
mind
the
weight
of
responsibility
attaching
to
its
decision
here
and
would
then
convict
or
acquit
the
accused
finally
he
wished
to
express
his
thanks
to
the
learned
counsel
for
the
prosecution
who
had
generously
refrained
from
demanding
a
conviction
a
pleasing
evidence
of
deep
and
humane
understanding
the
advocate
for
the
defence
sat
down
the
remainder
of
the
proceedings
did
not
take
long
the
summing
up
was
but
a
repetition
of
the
same
points
as
viewed
from
opposite
sides
a
brief
synopsis
of
the
action
of
the
play
dry
dull
and
dignified
it
had
all
been
managed
very
satisfactorily
all
round
both
the
advocates
had
pointed
out
what
the
court
should
consider
and
the
presiding
justice
found
his
task
easy
enough
lights
were
lit
a
couple
of
lamps
hanging
from
the
ceiling
a
miserable
light
it
was
the
justice
could
hardly
see
to
read
his
notes
he
mentioned
with
some
severity
the
point
that
the
death
had
not
been
duly
notified
to
the
proper
authorities
but
that
under
the
circumstances
should
be
considered
rather
the
duty
of
the
father
than
of
the
mother
owing
to
her
weakness
at
the
time
the
court
had
then
to
determine
whether
any
case
had
been
proved
with
regard
to
concealment
of
birth
and
infanticide
here
the
evidence
was
again
recapitulated
from
beginning
to
end
then
came
the
usual
injunction
as
to
being
duly
conscious
of
responsibility
which
the
court
had
heard
before
and
finally
the
not
uncommon
reminder
that
in
cases
of
doubt
the
scale
should
be
allowed
to
turn
in
favour
of
the
accused
and
now
all
was
clear
and
ready
the
judges
left
the
room
and
went
into
another
apartment
they
were
to
consider
a
paper
with
certain
questions
which
one
of
them
had
with
him
they
were
away
five
minutes
and
returned
with
a
no
to
all
the
questions
no
the
girl
barbro
had
not
killed
her
child
then
the
presiding
judge
said
a
few
more
words
and
declared
that
the
girl
barbro
was
now
free
the
emptied
the
comedy
was
over
someone
takes
axel
str√∂m
by
the
arm
it
is
geissler
h
said
he
so
you
done
with
that
now
ay
said
axel
but
they
wasted
a
lot
of
your
time
to
no
purpose
ay
said
axel
again
but
he
was
coming
to
himself
again
gradually
and
after
a
moment
he
added
none
the
less
i
glad
it
was
no
worse
no
worse
said
geissler
i
have
liked
to
see
them
try
he
spoke
with
emphasis
and
axel
fancied
geissler
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
case
himself
that
he
had
intervened
heaven
knows
if
after
all
it
had
not
been
geissler
himself
that
had
led
the
whole
proceedings
and
gained
the
result
he
wished
it
was
a
mystery
anyway
so
much
at
least
axel
understood
that
geissler
had
been
on
his
side
all
through
i
a
deal
to
thank
you
for
said
he
offering
his
hand
what
for
asked
geissler
why
for
for
all
this
geissler
turned
it
off
shortly
i
done
nothing
at
all
trouble
to
do
anything
was
worth
while
but
for
all
that
geissler
was
not
displeased
maybe
at
being
thanked
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
it
and
now
it
had
come
i
no
time
to
stand
talking
now
he
said
going
back
tomorrow
are
you
good
then
and
good
luck
to
you
and
geissler
strolled
off
across
the
street
on
the
boat
going
home
axel
encountered
the
lensmand
and
his
wife
barbro
and
the
two
girls
called
as
witnesses
well
said
fru
heyerdahl
are
you
glad
it
turned
out
so
well
axel
said
yes
he
was
glad
it
had
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
the
lensmand
himself
put
in
a
word
and
said
this
is
the
second
of
these
cases
i
had
while
i
been
here
first
with
inger
from
sellanraa
and
now
this
no
it
no
good
trying
to
countenance
that
sort
of
thing
justice
must
take
its
course
but
fru
heyerdahl
guessed
no
doubt
that
axel
was
not
over
pleased
with
her
speech
of
the
day
before
and
tried
to
smooth
it
over
to
make
up
for
it
somehow
now
you
understood
of
course
why
i
had
to
say
all
that
about
you
yesterday
h
ye
es
said
axel
you
understood
of
course
i
know
you
did
think
i
wanted
to
make
things
harder
for
you
in
any
way
i
always
thought
well
of
you
and
i
do
mind
saying
so
ay
said
axel
no
more
but
he
was
pleased
and
touched
at
her
words
yes
i
mean
it
said
fru
heyerdahl
but
i
was
obliged
to
try
and
shift
the
blame
a
little
your
way
otherwise
barbro
would
have
been
convicted
and
you
too
it
was
all
for
the
best
indeed
it
was
i
thank
you
kindly
said
axel
and
it
was
i
and
no
other
that
went
about
from
one
to
another
through
the
place
trying
to
do
what
i
could
for
you
both
and
you
saw
of
course
that
we
all
had
to
do
the
same
thing
make
out
that
you
were
partly
to
blame
so
as
to
get
you
both
off
in
the
end
ay
said
axel
surely
you
did
imagine
for
a
moment
that
i
meant
any
harm
to
you
when
i
always
thought
so
well
of
you
ay
this
was
good
to
hear
after
all
the
disgrace
of
it
axel
at
any
rate
was
so
touched
that
he
felt
he
must
do
something
give
fru
heyerdahl
something
or
other
whatever
he
could
find
a
piece
of
meat
perhaps
now
autumn
was
come
he
had
a
young
bull
fru
lensmand
heyerdahl
kept
her
word
she
took
barbro
to
live
with
her
on
board
the
steamer
too
she
looked
after
the
girl
and
saw
that
she
was
not
cold
nor
hungry
took
care
also
that
she
did
not
get
up
to
any
nonsense
with
the
mate
from
bergen
the
first
time
it
occurred
she
said
nothing
but
simply
called
barbro
to
her
but
a
little
while
after
there
was
barbro
with
him
again
her
head
on
one
side
talking
bergen
dialect
and
smiling
then
her
mistress
called
her
up
and
said
really
barbro
you
ought
not
to
be
going
on
like
that
among
the
men
now
remember
what
you
just
been
through
and
what
you
come
from
i
was
only
talking
to
him
a
minute
said
barbro
i
could
hear
he
was
from
bergen
axel
did
not
speak
to
her
he
noticed
that
she
was
pale
and
now
and
her
teeth
were
better
she
did
not
wear
either
of
his
rings
and
now
here
is
axel
tramping
up
to
his
own
place
once
more
wind
and
rain
but
he
is
glad
at
heart
a
and
a
harrow
down
at
the
quay
he
had
seen
them
oh
that
geissler
never
a
word
had
he
said
in
town
about
what
he
had
sent
ay
an
unfathomable
man
was
geissler
chapter
viii
axel
had
no
long
time
to
rest
at
home
as
it
turned
out
the
autumn
gales
led
to
fresh
trouble
and
bothersome
work
that
he
had
brought
upon
himself
the
telegraph
apparatus
on
his
wall
announced
that
the
line
was
out
of
order
oh
but
he
had
been
thinking
overmuch
of
the
money
surely
when
he
took
on
that
post
it
had
been
a
nuisance
from
the
start
brede
olsen
had
fairly
threatened
him
when
he
went
down
to
fetch
the
apparatus
and
tools
ay
had
said
to
him
in
as
many
words
you
do
seem
like
remembering
how
i
saved
your
life
last
winter
was
oline
saved
my
life
answered
axel
ho
indeed
and
did
i
carry
you
down
myself
on
my
own
poor
shoulders
anyway
you
were
clever
enough
to
buy
up
my
place
in
and
leave
me
homeless
in
the
winter
ay
brede
was
deeply
offended
he
went
on
but
you
can
take
the
telegraph
for
me
ay
all
the
rubble
of
it
for
me
i
and
mine
we
go
down
to
the
village
and
start
on
something
there
you
do
know
what
it
be
but
wait
and
see
what
about
a
hotel
place
where
folk
can
get
coffee
you
see
but
we
manage
all
right
there
my
wife
can
sell
things
to
eat
and
drink
as
well
as
another
and
i
can
go
out
on
business
and
make
a
heap
more
than
you
ever
did
but
i
do
mind
telling
you
axel
i
could
make
things
awkward
for
you
in
many
odd
ways
seeing
all
i
know
about
the
telegraph
and
things
ay
be
easy
enough
both
to
pull
down
poles
and
cut
the
line
and
all
and
then
you
to
go
running
out
after
it
midway
in
the
busy
time
that
all
i
say
to
you
axel
and
you
bear
it
in
mind
now
axel
should
have
been
down
and
brought
up
the
machines
from
the
quay
all
over
gilt
and
colouring
they
were
like
pictures
to
see
and
he
might
have
had
them
to
look
at
all
that
day
and
learn
the
manner
of
using
them
but
now
they
must
wait
was
none
so
pleasant
to
have
to
put
aside
all
manner
of
necessary
work
to
run
and
see
after
a
telegraph
line
but
was
the
money
up
on
the
top
of
the
hill
he
meets
aronsen
ay
aronsen
the
trader
standing
there
looking
and
gazing
out
into
the
storm
like
a
vision
himself
what
did
he
want
there
no
peace
in
his
mind
now
it
seems
but
he
must
go
up
the
fjeld
himself
and
look
at
the
mine
with
his
own
eyes
and
this
look
you
trader
aronsen
had
done
from
sheer
earnest
thought
of
his
own
and
his
family
future
here
he
is
face
to
face
with
bare
desolation
on
the
forsaken
hills
machines
lying
there
to
rust
carts
and
material
of
all
sorts
left
out
in
the
open
was
dismal
to
see
here
and
there
on
the
walls
of
the
huts
were
placards
notices
written
by
hand
forbidding
any
one
to
damage
or
remove
the
company
property
tools
carts
or
buildings
axel
stops
for
a
few
words
with
the
mad
trader
and
asks
if
he
has
come
out
shooting
shooting
ay
if
i
could
only
get
within
reach
of
him
him
who
then
why
him
that
ruining
me
and
all
the
rest
of
us
hereabout
him
that
wo
sell
his
bit
of
fjeld
and
let
things
get
to
work
again
and
trade
and
money
passing
same
as
before
mean
him
geissler
then
ay
is
him
i
mean
ought
to
be
shot
axel
laughs
at
this
and
says
geissler
he
was
in
town
but
a
few
days
back
you
should
have
talked
to
him
there
but
if
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
say
i
doubt
you
better
leave
him
alone
after
all
and
why
asks
aron
angrily
why
i
a
mind
he
be
overwise
and
mysterious
for
you
in
the
end
they
argued
over
this
for
a
while
and
aronsen
grew
more
excited
than
ever
at
last
axel
asked
jestingly
well
anyway
you
not
be
so
hard
on
us
all
to
run
away
and
leave
us
to
ourselves
in
the
wilds
huh
think
i
going
to
stay
fooling
about
here
in
your
bogs
and
never
so
much
as
making
the
price
of
a
pipe
cried
aron
indignantly
find
me
a
buyer
and
i
sell
out
sell
out
says
axel
the
land
good
ordinary
land
if
she
handled
as
should
be
and
what
you
got
enough
to
keep
a
man
have
i
just
said
i
not
touch
it
cried
aronsen
again
in
the
gale
i
can
do
better
than
that
axel
thought
if
that
was
so
be
easy
to
find
a
buyer
but
aronsen
laughed
scornfully
at
the
idea
there
was
nobody
there
in
the
wilds
had
money
to
buy
him
out
not
here
in
the
wilds
maybe
but
elsewhere
here
naught
but
filth
and
poverty
said
aron
bitterly
why
that
as
it
may
be
said
axel
in
some
offence
but
isak
up
at
sellanraa
he
could
buy
you
out
any
day
do
believe
it
said
aronsen
is
all
one
to
me
what
you
believe
said
axel
and
turned
to
go
aronsen
called
after
him
hi
wait
a
bit
what
that
you
say
isak
might
take
the
place
was
that
what
you
said
ay
said
axel
if
was
only
the
money
he
means
enough
to
buy
up
five
of
your
storborg
and
all
aronsen
had
gone
round
keeping
wide
of
sellanraa
on
his
way
up
taking
care
not
to
be
seen
but
going
back
he
called
in
and
had
a
talk
with
isak
but
isak
only
shook
his
head
and
said
nay
was
a
matter
never
thought
of
and
did
care
to
but
when
eleseus
came
back
home
that
christmas
isak
was
easier
to
deal
with
true
he
maintained
that
it
was
a
mad
idea
to
think
of
buying
storborg
was
nothing
had
ever
been
in
his
mind
still
if
eleseus
thought
he
could
do
anything
with
the
place
why
they
might
think
it
over
eleseus
himself
was
midways
between
as
it
were
not
exactly
eager
for
it
yet
not
altogether
indifferent
if
he
did
settle
down
here
at
home
then
his
career
in
one
way
was
at
an
end
was
not
like
being
in
a
town
that
autumn
when
a
lot
of
people
from
his
parts
had
been
up
for
in
a
certain
place
he
had
taken
care
not
to
show
himself
he
had
no
desire
to
meet
any
that
knew
him
from
that
quarter
they
belonged
to
another
world
and
was
he
now
to
go
back
to
that
same
world
himself
his
mother
was
all
for
buying
the
place
sivert
too
said
it
would
be
best
they
stuck
to
eleseus
both
of
them
and
one
day
the
three
drove
down
to
storborg
to
see
the
wonder
with
their
own
eyes
but
once
there
was
a
prospect
of
selling
aronsen
became
a
different
man
he
was
pressed
to
get
rid
of
it
not
at
all
if
he
did
go
away
the
place
could
stand
as
it
was
was
a
holding
a
cash
down
place
there
be
no
difficulty
in
selling
it
any
time
you
not
give
my
price
said
aronsen
they
went
over
the
house
and
stores
the
warehouse
and
sheds
inspected
the
miserable
remains
of
the
stock
consisting
of
a
few
boxes
of
coloured
papers
lamps
with
hanging
ornaments
all
utterly
unsaleable
to
sensible
folks
that
lived
on
their
land
there
were
a
few
cases
of
nails
and
some
cotton
print
and
that
was
all
eleseus
was
constrained
to
show
off
a
bit
and
looked
over
things
with
a
knowing
air
i
no
use
for
that
sort
of
truck
said
he
why
then
you
no
call
to
buy
it
said
aronsen
anyhow
i
offer
you
fifteen
hundred
for
the
place
as
it
stands
with
goods
live
stock
and
the
rest
said
eleseus
oh
he
was
careless
enough
his
offer
was
but
a
show
for
something
to
say
and
they
drove
back
home
no
there
was
no
deal
eleseus
had
made
a
ridiculous
offer
that
aronsen
regarded
as
an
insult
i
do
think
much
of
you
young
man
said
aronsen
ay
calling
him
young
man
considering
him
but
a
slip
of
a
lad
that
had
grown
conceited
in
the
town
and
thought
to
teach
him
aronsen
the
value
of
goods
i
not
be
called
man
by
you
if
you
please
said
eleseus
offended
in
his
turn
they
must
be
mortal
enemies
after
that
but
how
could
it
be
that
aronsen
had
all
along
been
so
independent
and
so
sure
of
not
being
forced
to
sell
there
was
a
reason
for
it
aronsen
had
a
little
hope
at
the
back
of
his
mind
after
all
a
meeting
had
been
held
in
the
village
to
consider
the
position
which
had
arisen
owing
to
geissler
refusal
to
sell
his
part
of
the
mining
tract
was
not
only
the
outlying
settlers
who
stood
to
lose
by
this
it
would
be
fatal
to
the
whole
district
why
could
not
folk
go
on
living
as
well
or
as
poorly
now
as
before
there
had
been
any
mine
at
all
well
they
could
not
and
that
was
all
about
it
they
had
grown
accustomed
to
better
food
finer
bread
clothes
and
higher
wages
general
extravagance
ay
folk
had
learned
to
reckon
with
money
more
that
was
the
matter
and
now
the
money
was
gone
again
had
slipped
away
like
a
shoal
of
herring
out
to
sea
was
dire
distress
for
them
all
and
what
was
to
be
done
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
geissler
was
taking
his
revenge
upon
the
village
because
they
had
helped
his
superior
to
get
him
dismissed
equally
clear
was
it
that
they
had
underestimated
him
at
the
time
he
had
not
simply
disappeared
and
left
by
the
simplest
means
merely
by
demanding
an
unreasonable
price
for
a
mine
he
had
succeeded
in
checking
the
entire
development
of
the
district
ay
a
strong
man
axel
str√∂m
from
maaneland
could
bear
them
out
in
this
he
was
the
one
who
had
last
met
geissler
brede
girl
barbro
had
had
a
lawsuit
in
the
town
and
come
home
acquitted
but
geissler
he
had
been
there
in
court
all
the
time
and
if
any
one
suggested
that
geissler
was
dejected
and
a
broken
man
why
he
had
only
to
look
at
the
costly
machines
that
same
geissler
had
sent
up
as
a
present
to
axel
str√∂m
this
man
it
was
then
who
held
the
fate
of
the
district
in
his
hand
they
would
have
to
come
to
some
agreement
with
him
what
price
would
geissler
ultimately
be
disposed
to
accept
for
his
mine
they
must
ascertain
in
any
case
the
swedes
had
offered
him
thousand
geissler
had
refused
but
suppose
the
village
here
the
commune
were
to
make
up
the
remainder
simply
to
get
things
going
again
if
it
were
not
an
altogether
amount
it
might
be
worth
while
both
the
trader
at
the
shore
station
and
aronsen
up
at
storborg
would
be
willing
to
contribute
privately
and
secretly
funds
devoted
to
such
a
purpose
now
would
be
repaid
in
the
long
run
the
end
of
it
was
that
two
men
were
deputed
to
call
on
geissler
and
take
up
the
matter
with
him
and
they
were
expected
back
shortly
so
it
was
then
that
aronsen
cherished
a
flicker
of
hope
and
thought
he
could
afford
to
stand
on
his
dignity
with
any
who
offered
to
buy
up
storborg
but
it
was
not
to
last
a
week
later
the
deputation
returned
home
with
a
flat
refusal
oh
they
had
done
the
worst
thing
possible
at
the
outset
in
choosing
brede
olsen
as
one
of
the
men
they
sent
they
had
taken
him
as
being
one
who
best
could
spare
the
time
they
had
found
geissler
but
he
had
only
shaken
his
head
and
laughed
go
back
home
again
he
had
said
but
geissler
had
paid
for
their
journey
back
then
the
district
was
to
be
left
to
its
fate
after
aronsen
had
raged
for
a
while
and
grown
more
and
more
desperate
he
went
up
one
day
to
sellanraa
and
closed
the
deal
ay
aronsen
did
eleseus
got
it
for
the
price
he
had
offered
land
and
house
and
sheds
live
stock
and
goods
for
fifteen
hundred
true
on
going
through
the
inventory
after
it
was
found
that
aronsen
wife
had
converted
most
of
the
cotton
print
to
her
own
use
but
trifles
of
that
sort
were
nothing
to
a
man
like
eleseus
it
do
to
be
mean
he
said
nevertheless
eleseus
was
not
exactly
delighted
with
things
as
they
had
turned
out
his
future
was
settled
now
he
was
to
bury
himself
in
the
wilds
he
must
give
up
his
great
plans
he
was
no
longer
a
young
gentleman
in
an
office
he
would
never
be
a
lensmand
not
even
live
in
a
town
at
all
to
his
father
and
those
at
home
he
made
it
appear
that
he
was
proud
at
having
secured
storborg
at
the
very
price
he
had
fixed
it
would
show
them
he
knew
what
he
was
about
but
that
small
triumph
did
not
go
very
far
he
had
also
the
satisfaction
of
taking
over
andresen
the
chief
clerk
who
was
thus
as
it
were
included
in
the
bargain
aronsen
had
no
longer
any
use
for
him
until
he
had
a
new
place
going
it
was
a
pleasant
sensation
to
be
eleseus
when
andresen
came
up
begging
to
be
allowed
to
stay
here
it
was
eleseus
who
was
master
and
head
of
the
business
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
you
can
stay
yes
he
said
i
shall
be
wanting
an
assistant
to
look
after
the
place
when
i
away
on
business
opening
up
connections
in
bergen
and
trondhjem
said
he
and
andresen
was
no
bad
man
to
have
as
it
soon
proved
he
was
a
good
worker
and
looked
after
things
well
when
eleseus
was
away
was
only
at
first
he
had
been
somewhat
inclined
to
show
and
play
the
fine
gentleman
and
that
was
the
fault
of
his
master
aronsen
it
was
different
now
in
the
spring
when
the
bogs
were
thawed
some
depth
sivert
came
down
from
sellanraa
to
storborg
to
start
a
bit
of
ditching
for
his
brother
and
lo
andresen
himself
went
out
on
the
land
digging
too
heaven
knows
what
possessed
him
to
do
it
for
was
no
work
of
his
but
that
was
the
sort
of
man
he
was
it
was
not
thawed
deep
enough
yet
and
they
could
not
get
as
far
as
they
wanted
by
a
long
way
but
it
was
something
done
at
any
rate
it
was
isak
old
idea
to
drain
the
bogs
at
storborg
and
till
the
land
there
properly
the
bit
of
a
store
was
only
to
be
an
extra
a
convenience
to
save
folk
going
all
the
way
down
to
the
village
for
a
reel
of
thread
so
sivert
and
andresen
stood
there
digging
and
talking
now
and
again
when
they
stopped
for
a
rest
andresen
had
also
somehow
or
other
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
gold
piece
a
piece
and
sivert
would
gladly
have
had
the
bright
thing
himself
but
andresen
would
not
part
with
it
kept
it
wrapped
up
in
tissue
paper
in
his
chest
sivert
proposed
a
wrestling
match
for
the
money
see
who
could
throw
the
other
but
andresen
would
not
risk
it
sivert
offered
to
stake
twenty
in
notes
against
the
gold
piece
and
do
all
the
digging
himself
into
the
bargain
if
he
won
but
andresen
took
offence
at
that
ho
said
he
and
you
like
to
go
back
home
no
doubt
and
say
i
no
good
at
working
on
the
land
at
last
they
agreed
to
set
in
notes
against
the
gold
piece
and
sivert
slipped
home
to
sellanraa
that
night
to
ask
his
father
for
the
money
a
young
man
trick
the
pretty
play
of
youth
a
night
sleep
thrown
away
to
walk
miles
up
and
miles
down
again
and
work
next
day
as
usual
was
nothing
to
a
young
man
in
his
strength
and
a
bright
gold
piece
was
worth
it
all
andresen
was
a
little
inclined
to
make
fun
of
him
over
the
deal
but
sivert
was
not
at
a
loss
he
had
only
to
let
fall
a
word
of
leopoldine
there
i
was
nearly
forgetting
leopoldine
she
asked
after
you
and
andresen
stopped
his
work
of
a
sudden
and
went
very
red
pleasant
days
for
them
both
draining
and
ditching
getting
up
long
arguments
for
fun
and
working
and
arguing
again
now
and
then
eleseus
would
come
out
and
lend
a
hand
but
he
soon
tired
eleseus
was
not
strong
either
of
body
or
will
but
a
thorough
good
fellow
for
all
that
here
that
oline
coming
along
sivert
the
jester
would
say
now
you
have
to
go
in
and
sell
her
a
paper
of
coffee
and
eleseus
was
glad
enough
to
go
selling
oline
some
trifle
or
other
meant
so
many
minutes
rest
from
throwing
heavy
clods
and
oline
poor
creature
she
might
well
be
needing
a
pinch
of
coffee
now
and
again
whether
by
chance
she
managed
to
get
the
money
from
axel
to
pay
for
it
or
bartered
a
goats
milk
cheese
in
exchange
oline
was
not
altogether
what
she
had
been
the
work
at
maaneland
was
too
hard
for
her
she
was
an
old
woman
now
and
it
was
leaving
its
mark
not
that
she
ever
confessed
to
any
weakness
or
ageing
herself
ho
she
would
have
found
plenty
to
say
if
she
had
been
dismissed
tough
and
irrepressible
was
oline
did
her
work
and
found
time
to
wander
over
to
neighbours
here
or
there
for
a
real
good
gossip
was
her
plain
right
and
there
was
little
gossiping
at
maaneland
axel
himself
was
not
given
that
way
as
for
that
barbro
case
oline
was
displeased
ay
disappointed
was
oline
both
of
them
acquitted
that
brede
girl
barbro
should
be
let
off
when
inger
sellanraa
had
got
eight
years
was
not
to
oline
taste
at
all
she
felt
an
unchristian
annoyance
at
such
favouritism
but
the
almighty
would
look
to
things
no
doubt
in
his
own
good
time
and
oline
nodded
as
if
prophesying
divine
retribution
at
a
later
date
naturally
also
oline
made
no
secret
of
her
dissatisfaction
with
the
finding
of
the
court
more
especially
when
she
happened
to
fall
out
with
her
master
axel
over
any
little
trifle
then
she
would
deliver
herself
in
the
old
way
of
much
deep
and
bitter
sarcasm
ay
is
strange
how
the
law
changed
these
days
for
all
the
wickedness
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
but
the
word
of
the
lord
my
guide
as
ever
was
and
a
blessed
refuge
for
the
meek
oh
axel
was
sick
and
tired
of
his
housekeeper
now
and
wished
her
anywhere
and
now
with
spring
coming
again
and
all
the
season
work
to
do
alone
haymaking
to
come
and
what
was
he
to
do
was
a
poor
his
brother
wife
at
breidablik
had
written
home
to
helgeland
trying
to
find
a
decent
woman
to
help
him
but
nothing
had
come
of
it
as
yet
and
in
any
case
it
would
mean
his
having
to
pay
for
the
journey
nay
was
a
mean
and
wicked
trick
of
barbro
to
make
away
with
the
bit
of
a
child
and
then
run
off
herself
a
summer
and
two
winters
now
he
had
been
forced
to
make
do
with
oline
and
no
saying
how
much
longer
it
might
be
yet
and
barbro
the
creature
did
she
care
he
had
had
a
few
words
with
her
down
in
the
village
one
day
that
winter
but
never
a
tear
had
trickled
slowly
from
her
eyes
to
freeze
on
her
cheek
what
you
done
with
rings
i
gave
you
asks
he
rings
ay
the
rings
i
have
got
them
now
ho
so
you
have
got
them
now
was
all
over
between
us
said
she
and
i
could
wear
them
after
that
is
not
the
way
to
go
on
wearing
rings
when
it
all
over
between
you
well
i
just
like
to
know
what
you
done
with
them
that
all
wanted
me
to
give
them
back
maybe
said
she
well
i
never
thought
you
have
had
me
put
you
to
that
shame
axel
thought
for
a
moment
and
said
i
could
have
made
it
up
to
you
other
ways
that
you
should
lose
by
it
i
mean
but
no
barbro
had
got
rid
of
the
rings
and
never
so
much
as
gave
him
the
chance
of
buying
back
a
gold
ring
and
a
silver
ring
at
a
reasonable
price
for
all
that
barbro
was
not
so
thoroughly
harsh
and
unlovable
that
she
was
not
she
had
a
long
apron
thing
that
fastened
over
the
shoulders
and
with
tucks
at
the
edge
and
a
strip
of
white
stuff
up
round
her
neck
ay
she
looked
well
there
were
some
said
she
found
a
lad
already
down
in
the
village
to
go
sweethearting
with
though
maybe
was
but
their
talk
after
all
fru
heyerdahl
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
her
at
any
rate
and
took
care
not
to
let
her
go
to
the
christmas
dances
ay
fru
heyerdahl
was
careful
enough
that
she
was
here
was
axel
standing
talking
to
his
former
about
a
matter
of
two
rings
and
suddenly
fru
heyerdahl
comes
right
between
them
and
says
barbro
i
thought
you
were
going
to
the
store
off
goes
barbro
and
her
mistress
turns
to
axel
and
says
have
you
come
down
with
some
meat
or
something
h
said
axel
just
that
and
touched
his
cap
now
it
was
fru
heyerdahl
that
had
praised
him
up
so
that
last
autumn
saying
he
was
a
splendid
fellow
and
she
had
always
thought
well
of
him
and
one
good
turn
was
worth
another
no
doubt
axel
knew
the
way
of
doing
things
was
an
old
story
when
simple
folk
had
dealing
with
their
betters
with
authority
and
he
had
thought
at
once
of
a
piece
of
butcher
meat
a
bull
he
had
that
might
be
useful
there
but
time
went
on
and
month
and
month
passed
by
and
autumn
was
gone
and
the
bull
was
never
killed
and
what
harm
could
it
do
after
all
if
he
kept
it
for
himself
give
it
away
and
he
would
be
so
much
poorer
and
was
a
fine
beast
anyway
h
nay
said
axel
shaking
his
head
he
no
meat
with
him
today
but
fru
heyerdahl
seemed
to
be
guessing
his
thoughts
for
she
said
i
heard
you
an
ox
or
what
ay
so
i
have
said
axel
are
you
going
to
keep
it
ay
i
be
keeping
him
yet
i
see
you
no
sheep
to
be
killed
not
now
i
have
is
this
way
i
never
had
but
what
to
be
kept
on
the
place
oh
i
see
said
fru
heyerdahl
well
that
was
all
and
she
went
on
her
way
axel
drove
up
homeward
but
he
could
not
help
thinking
somewhat
of
what
had
passed
he
rather
feared
he
had
made
a
false
step
somehow
the
lensmand
lady
had
been
an
important
witness
once
for
and
against
him
but
important
anyway
he
had
been
through
an
unpleasant
time
on
that
occasion
but
after
all
he
had
got
out
of
it
in
the
end
got
out
of
a
very
awkward
business
in
connection
with
the
body
of
a
child
found
buried
on
his
land
perhaps
after
all
he
had
better
kill
that
sheep
and
strangely
enough
this
thought
was
somehow
connected
with
barbro
if
he
came
down
bringing
sheep
for
her
mistress
it
could
hardly
fail
to
make
a
certain
impression
on
barbro
herself
but
again
the
days
went
on
and
nothing
evil
happened
for
their
going
on
next
time
he
drove
down
to
the
village
he
had
no
sheep
on
his
cart
no
still
no
sheep
but
at
the
last
moment
he
had
taken
a
lamb
a
big
lamb
though
not
a
miserable
little
one
by
any
means
and
he
delivered
it
with
these
words
is
rare
tough
meat
on
a
wether
and
no
sort
of
a
gift
to
bring
but
this
is
none
so
bad
but
fru
heyerdahl
would
not
hear
of
taking
it
as
a
gift
say
what
you
want
for
it
she
said
oh
a
fine
lady
was
not
her
way
to
take
gifts
from
folk
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
axel
got
a
good
price
for
his
lamb
he
saw
nothing
of
barbro
at
all
lensmand
lady
had
seen
him
coming
and
got
her
out
of
the
way
and
good
luck
go
with
her
barbro
that
had
cheated
him
out
of
his
help
for
a
year
and
a
half
chapter
ix
that
spring
something
unexpected
happened
something
of
importance
indeed
work
at
the
mine
was
started
again
geissler
had
sold
his
land
inconceivable
oh
but
geissler
was
an
unfathomable
mind
he
could
make
a
bargain
or
refuse
shake
his
head
for
a
no
or
nod
the
same
for
yes
could
make
the
whole
village
smile
again
conscience
had
pricked
him
maybe
he
had
no
longer
the
heart
to
see
the
district
where
he
had
been
lensmand
famishing
on
gruel
and
short
of
money
or
had
he
got
his
quarter
of
a
million
possibly
again
geissler
himself
had
at
last
begun
to
feel
the
need
of
money
and
had
been
forced
to
sell
for
what
he
could
get
or
fifty
thousand
was
not
to
be
despised
after
all
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
rumours
that
it
was
his
eldest
son
who
had
settled
the
business
on
his
father
account
be
that
as
it
might
work
was
recommenced
the
same
engineer
came
again
with
his
gangs
of
men
and
the
work
went
on
anew
the
same
work
ay
but
in
a
different
fashion
now
going
backwards
as
it
were
all
seemed
in
regular
order
the
swedish
had
brought
their
men
and
dynamite
and
money
what
could
be
wrong
anyway
even
aronsen
came
back
again
aronsen
the
trader
who
had
set
his
mind
on
buying
back
storborg
from
eleseus
no
said
eleseus
it
not
for
sale
you
sell
i
suppose
if
you
offered
enough
no
no
eleseus
was
not
going
to
sell
storborg
the
truth
was
he
had
changed
his
mind
somewhat
as
to
the
position
it
was
none
so
bad
after
all
to
be
owner
of
a
trading
station
in
the
hills
he
had
a
fine
verandah
with
coloured
glass
windows
and
a
chief
clerk
to
do
all
the
work
while
he
himself
went
about
the
country
travelling
ay
travelling
first
class
with
fine
folks
one
day
perhaps
he
might
be
able
to
go
as
far
as
america
he
often
thought
of
that
even
these
little
journeys
on
business
to
the
towns
down
in
the
south
were
something
to
live
on
for
a
long
time
after
not
that
he
let
himself
go
altogether
and
chartered
a
steamer
of
his
own
and
held
wild
orgies
on
the
way
orgies
were
not
in
his
line
a
strange
fellow
was
eleseus
he
no
longer
cared
about
girls
had
given
up
such
things
altogether
lost
all
interest
in
them
no
but
after
all
he
was
the
son
and
travelled
first
class
and
bought
up
loads
of
goods
and
each
time
he
came
back
a
little
finer
than
before
a
greater
man
the
last
time
he
even
wore
galoshes
to
keep
his
feet
dry
what
that
you
taken
to
wearing
two
pairs
of
shoes
they
said
i
been
suffering
from
chilblains
lately
says
eleseus
and
every
one
sympathized
with
eleseus
and
his
chilblains
glorious
days
a
grand
life
with
no
end
of
leisure
no
he
was
not
going
to
sell
storborg
what
go
back
to
a
little
town
and
stand
behind
the
counter
in
a
little
shop
and
no
chief
clerk
of
his
own
at
all
moreover
he
had
made
up
his
mind
now
to
develop
the
business
on
a
grand
scale
the
swedes
had
come
back
again
and
would
flood
the
place
with
money
he
would
be
a
fool
to
sell
out
now
aronsen
was
forced
to
go
back
each
time
with
a
flat
refusal
more
and
more
disgusted
at
his
own
lack
of
foresight
in
ever
having
given
up
the
place
oh
but
aronsen
might
have
saved
himself
a
deal
of
and
likewise
eleseus
with
his
plans
and
intentions
that
he
might
have
kept
in
moderation
and
more
than
all
the
village
would
have
done
well
to
be
less
confident
instead
of
going
about
smiling
and
rubbing
its
hands
like
angels
sure
of
being
blessed
no
call
for
them
to
do
so
if
they
had
but
known
for
now
came
disappointment
and
no
little
one
at
that
who
would
ever
have
thought
it
work
at
the
mine
commenced
again
true
enough
but
at
the
other
end
of
the
fjeld
eight
miles
away
on
the
southern
boundary
of
geissler
holding
far
off
in
another
district
altogether
a
district
with
which
they
were
in
no
way
concerned
and
from
there
the
work
was
to
make
its
way
gradually
northward
to
the
original
mine
isak
mine
to
be
a
blessing
to
folk
in
the
wilds
and
in
the
village
at
best
it
would
take
years
any
number
of
years
a
generation
the
news
came
like
a
dynamite
charge
of
the
heaviest
sort
with
shock
and
stopping
of
ears
the
village
folk
were
overcome
with
grief
some
blamed
geissler
was
geissler
that
devil
of
a
man
who
had
tricked
them
once
more
others
huddled
together
at
a
meeting
and
sent
out
a
new
deputation
of
trusty
men
this
time
to
the
mining
company
to
the
engineer
but
nothing
came
of
it
the
engineer
explained
that
he
was
obliged
to
start
work
from
the
south
because
that
was
nearest
the
sea
and
saved
the
need
of
an
aerial
railway
reduced
the
transport
almost
to
nil
no
the
work
must
begin
that
way
no
more
to
be
said
then
it
was
that
aronsen
at
once
rose
up
and
set
out
for
the
new
workings
the
new
promised
land
he
even
tried
to
get
andresen
to
go
with
him
what
the
sense
of
you
staying
on
here
in
the
wilds
said
he
much
better
come
with
me
but
andresen
would
not
leave
incomprehensible
but
so
it
was
there
was
something
which
held
him
to
the
spot
he
seemed
to
thrive
there
had
taken
root
it
must
be
andresen
who
had
changed
for
the
place
was
the
same
as
ever
folk
and
things
were
unaltered
the
mining
work
had
turned
away
to
other
tracts
but
folk
in
the
wilds
had
not
lost
their
heads
over
that
they
had
their
land
to
till
their
crops
their
cattle
no
great
wealth
in
money
true
but
in
all
the
necessaries
of
life
ay
absolutely
all
even
eleseus
was
not
reduced
to
misery
because
the
stream
of
gold
was
flowing
elsewhere
the
worst
of
it
was
that
in
his
first
exaltation
he
had
bought
great
stocks
of
goods
that
were
now
unsaleable
well
they
could
stay
there
for
the
time
being
it
looked
well
at
any
rate
to
have
plenty
of
wares
in
a
store
no
a
man
of
the
wilds
did
not
lose
his
head
the
air
was
not
less
healthy
now
than
before
there
were
folk
enough
to
admire
new
clothes
there
was
no
need
of
diamonds
wine
was
a
thing
he
knew
from
the
feast
at
cana
a
man
of
the
wild
was
not
put
out
by
the
thought
of
great
things
he
could
not
get
art
newspapers
luxuries
politics
and
were
worth
just
what
folk
were
willing
to
pay
for
them
no
more
growth
of
the
soil
was
something
different
a
thing
to
be
procured
at
any
cost
the
only
source
the
origin
of
all
a
dull
and
desolate
existence
nay
least
of
all
a
man
had
everything
his
powers
above
his
dreams
his
loves
his
wealth
of
superstition
sivert
walking
one
evening
by
the
river
stops
on
a
sudden
there
on
the
water
are
a
pair
of
ducks
male
and
female
they
have
sighted
him
they
are
aware
of
man
and
afraid
one
of
them
says
something
utters
a
little
sound
a
melody
in
three
tones
and
the
other
answers
with
the
same
then
they
rise
whirl
off
like
two
little
wheels
a
up
the
river
and
settle
again
then
as
before
one
speaks
and
the
other
answers
the
same
speech
as
at
first
but
mark
a
new
delight
is
set
two
octaves
sivert
stands
looking
at
the
birds
looking
past
them
far
into
a
dream
a
sound
had
floated
through
him
a
sweetness
and
left
him
standing
there
with
a
delicate
thin
recollection
of
something
wild
and
splendid
something
he
had
known
before
and
forgotten
again
he
walks
home
in
silence
says
no
word
of
it
makes
no
boast
of
it
was
not
for
worldly
speech
and
it
was
but
sivert
from
sellanraa
went
out
one
evening
young
and
ordinary
as
he
was
and
met
with
this
it
was
not
the
only
thing
he
met
with
there
were
more
adventures
beside
another
thing
which
happened
was
that
jensine
left
sellanraa
and
that
made
sivert
not
a
little
perturbed
in
his
mind
ay
it
came
to
that
jensine
would
leave
if
you
please
she
wished
it
so
oh
jensine
was
not
one
of
your
common
sort
none
could
say
that
sivert
had
once
offered
to
drive
her
back
home
at
once
and
on
that
occasion
she
had
cried
which
was
a
pity
but
afterwards
she
repented
of
that
and
made
it
clear
that
she
repented
and
gave
notice
and
would
leave
ay
a
proper
way
to
do
nothing
could
have
suited
inger
at
sellanraa
better
than
this
inger
was
beginning
to
grow
dissatisfied
with
her
maid
strange
she
had
nothing
to
say
against
her
but
the
sight
of
the
girl
annoyed
her
she
could
hardly
endure
to
have
her
about
the
place
it
all
arose
no
doubt
from
inger
state
of
mind
she
had
been
heavy
and
religious
all
that
winter
and
it
would
not
pass
off
want
to
leave
do
you
why
then
well
and
good
said
inger
it
was
a
blessing
the
fulfilment
of
nightly
prayers
two
grown
women
they
were
already
what
did
they
want
with
this
jensine
fresh
as
could
be
and
marriageable
and
all
inger
thought
with
a
certain
displeasure
of
that
same
marriageableness
thinking
maybe
how
she
had
once
been
the
same
herself
her
deep
religiousness
did
not
pass
off
she
was
not
full
of
vice
she
had
tasted
sipped
let
us
say
but
was
not
her
intent
to
persevere
in
that
way
all
through
her
old
age
not
by
any
means
inger
turned
aside
with
horror
from
the
thought
the
mine
and
all
its
workmen
were
no
longer
there
and
heaven
be
praised
virtue
was
not
only
tolerable
but
inevitable
it
was
a
necessary
thing
ay
a
necessary
good
a
special
grace
but
the
world
was
all
awry
look
now
here
was
leopoldine
little
leopoldine
a
seedling
a
slip
of
a
child
going
about
bursting
with
sinful
health
but
an
arm
round
her
waist
and
she
would
fall
helpless
oh
fie
there
were
spots
on
her
face
now
too
a
sign
in
itself
of
wild
blood
ay
her
mother
remembered
well
enough
was
the
wild
blood
would
out
inger
did
not
condemn
her
child
for
a
matter
of
spots
her
face
but
it
must
stop
she
would
have
an
end
of
it
and
what
did
that
fellow
andresen
want
coming
up
to
sellanraa
of
sundays
to
talk
fieldwork
with
isak
did
the
two
menfolk
imagine
the
child
was
blind
ay
young
folk
were
young
folk
as
they
had
ever
been
thirty
forty
years
ago
but
worse
than
ever
now
why
that
as
it
may
be
said
isak
when
they
spoke
of
the
matter
but
here
the
spring
come
and
jensine
gone
and
who
to
manage
the
summer
work
leopoldine
and
i
can
do
the
haymaking
said
inger
ay
i
rather
go
raking
night
and
day
myself
said
she
bitterly
and
on
the
point
of
crying
isak
could
not
understand
what
there
was
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
but
he
had
his
own
ideas
no
doubt
and
off
he
went
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
with
crowbar
and
pick
and
fell
to
working
at
a
stone
nay
indeed
isak
could
not
see
why
jensine
should
have
left
them
a
good
girl
and
a
worker
to
tell
the
truth
isak
was
often
at
a
loss
in
all
save
the
simplest
things
his
work
his
lawful
and
natural
doings
a
man
well
filled
out
nothing
astral
about
him
at
all
he
ate
like
a
man
and
throve
on
it
and
was
rarely
he
was
thrown
off
his
balance
in
any
way
well
here
was
this
stone
there
were
stones
more
in
plenty
but
here
was
one
to
begin
with
isak
is
looking
ahead
to
the
time
when
he
will
need
to
build
a
little
house
here
a
little
home
for
himself
and
inger
and
as
well
to
get
to
work
a
bit
on
the
site
and
clear
it
while
sivert
is
down
at
storborg
otherwise
the
boy
would
be
asking
questions
and
that
was
not
to
isak
mind
the
day
must
come
of
course
when
sivert
would
need
all
there
was
of
the
place
for
himself
the
old
folks
would
be
wanting
a
house
apart
ay
there
was
never
an
end
of
building
at
sellanraa
that
fodder
loft
above
the
cowshed
was
not
done
yet
though
the
beams
and
planks
for
it
were
there
all
ready
well
then
here
was
this
stone
nothing
so
big
to
look
at
above
ground
but
not
to
be
moved
at
a
touch
for
all
that
it
must
be
a
heavy
fellow
isak
dug
round
about
it
and
tried
his
crowbar
but
it
would
not
move
he
dug
again
and
tried
once
more
but
no
back
to
the
house
for
a
spade
then
and
clear
the
earth
away
then
digging
again
trying
again
no
a
mighty
heavy
beast
to
shift
thought
isak
patiently
enough
he
dug
away
now
for
a
steady
while
but
the
stone
seemed
reaching
ever
deeper
and
deeper
down
there
was
no
getting
a
purchase
on
it
a
nuisance
it
would
be
if
he
had
to
blast
it
after
all
the
boring
would
make
such
a
noise
and
call
up
every
one
on
the
place
he
dug
off
again
to
fetch
a
levering
pole
and
tried
that
no
he
dug
again
isak
was
beginning
to
be
annoyed
with
this
stone
he
frowned
and
looked
at
the
thing
as
if
he
had
just
come
along
to
make
a
general
inspection
of
the
stones
in
that
neighbourhood
and
found
this
one
particularly
stupid
he
criticized
it
ay
it
was
a
idiotic
stone
no
getting
hold
of
it
any
way
he
was
almost
inclined
to
say
it
was
deformed
blasting
the
thing
worth
a
charge
of
powder
and
was
he
to
give
it
up
was
he
to
consider
the
possibility
of
being
beaten
by
a
stone
he
dug
hard
work
that
it
was
but
as
to
giving
up
at
last
he
got
the
nose
of
his
lever
down
and
tried
it
the
stone
did
not
move
technically
speaking
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
his
method
but
it
did
not
work
what
was
the
matter
then
he
had
got
out
stones
before
in
his
life
was
he
getting
old
funny
thing
he
he
he
ridiculous
indeed
true
he
had
noticed
lately
that
he
was
not
so
strong
as
he
had
been
that
is
to
say
he
had
noticed
nothing
of
the
sort
never
heeded
it
was
only
imagination
and
he
goes
at
the
stone
once
more
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
oh
was
no
little
matter
when
isak
bore
down
on
a
levering
pole
with
all
his
weight
there
he
is
now
hoisting
and
hoisting
again
a
cyclop
enormous
with
a
torso
that
seems
built
in
one
to
the
knees
a
certain
pomp
and
splendour
about
him
his
equator
was
astounding
but
the
stone
did
not
move
no
help
for
it
he
must
dig
again
try
blasting
not
a
word
no
dig
again
he
was
intent
on
his
work
now
the
stone
should
come
up
it
would
be
wrong
to
say
there
was
anything
at
all
perverse
in
this
on
isak
part
it
was
the
ingrown
love
of
a
worker
on
the
soil
but
altogether
without
tenderness
it
was
a
foolish
sight
first
gathering
as
it
were
about
the
stone
from
all
sides
then
making
a
dash
at
it
then
digging
all
round
its
sides
and
fumbling
at
it
throwing
up
the
earth
with
his
bare
hands
ay
so
he
did
yet
there
was
nothing
of
a
caress
in
it
all
warmth
yes
but
the
warmth
of
zeal
alone
try
the
lever
again
he
thrust
it
down
where
there
was
best
hold
no
an
altogether
remarkable
instance
of
obstinacy
and
defiance
on
the
part
of
the
stone
but
it
seemed
to
be
giving
isak
tries
again
with
a
touch
of
hope
the
has
a
feeling
now
that
the
stone
is
no
longer
invincible
then
the
lever
slipped
throwing
him
to
the
ground
devil
said
he
ay
he
said
that
his
cap
had
got
thrust
down
over
one
ear
as
he
fell
making
him
look
like
a
robber
like
a
spaniard
he
spat
here
comes
inger
isak
come
in
and
have
your
food
now
says
she
kindly
and
pleasant
as
can
be
ay
says
he
but
will
have
her
no
nearer
and
wants
no
questions
oh
but
inger
never
dreaming
she
comes
nearer
what
in
your
mind
now
she
asks
to
soften
him
with
a
hint
of
the
way
he
thinks
out
some
new
grand
thing
almost
every
day
but
isak
is
sullen
terribly
sullen
and
stern
he
says
nay
i
know
and
inger
again
foolish
that
she
is
ugh
keeps
on
talking
and
asking
and
will
not
go
seeing
as
you
seen
it
yourself
says
he
at
last
i
getting
up
this
stone
here
ho
going
to
get
him
up
ay
and
could
i
help
a
bit
at
all
she
asks
isak
shakes
his
head
but
it
was
a
kindly
thought
anyway
that
she
would
have
helped
him
and
he
can
hardly
be
harsh
in
return
if
you
just
wait
the
least
bit
of
a
while
says
he
and
runs
home
for
the
hammers
if
he
could
only
get
the
stone
rough
a
bit
knocking
off
a
flake
or
so
in
the
right
spot
it
would
give
the
lever
a
better
hold
inger
holds
the
and
isak
strikes
strikes
strikes
ay
sure
enough
off
goes
a
flake
was
a
good
help
says
isak
and
thanks
but
do
trouble
about
food
for
me
this
bit
of
a
while
i
must
get
this
stone
up
first
but
inger
does
not
go
and
to
tell
the
truth
isak
is
pleased
enough
to
have
her
there
watching
him
at
his
work
is
a
thing
has
always
pleased
him
since
their
young
days
and
lo
he
gets
a
fine
purchase
now
on
the
lever
and
puts
his
weight
into
it
the
stone
moves
moving
says
inger
is
but
your
nonsense
says
isak
nonsense
indeed
but
it
is
got
so
far
then
and
that
was
something
the
stone
was
so
to
speak
converted
now
was
on
his
side
they
were
working
together
isak
hoists
and
heaves
with
his
lever
and
the
stone
moves
but
no
more
he
keeps
at
it
a
while
nothing
more
all
at
once
he
understands
that
it
is
not
merely
a
question
of
weight
the
dead
pull
of
his
body
no
the
fact
is
that
he
has
no
longer
his
old
strength
he
has
lost
the
tough
agility
that
makes
all
the
difference
weight
an
easy
matter
enough
to
hang
on
with
his
weight
and
break
an
pole
no
he
was
weakening
that
was
it
and
the
patient
man
is
filled
with
bitterness
at
the
thought
at
least
he
might
have
been
spared
the
shame
of
having
inger
here
to
see
it
suddenly
he
drops
the
lever
and
grasps
the
sledge
a
fury
takes
him
he
is
minded
to
go
at
it
violently
now
and
see
his
cap
still
hangs
on
one
ear
and
now
he
steps
mightily
threateningly
round
the
stone
trying
as
it
were
to
set
himself
in
the
proper
light
ho
he
will
leave
that
stone
a
ruin
and
a
wreck
of
what
it
had
been
why
not
when
a
man
is
filled
with
mortal
hatred
of
a
stone
it
is
a
mere
formality
to
crush
it
and
suppose
the
stone
resists
suppose
it
declines
to
be
crushed
why
let
it
try
and
see
which
of
the
two
survives
but
then
it
is
that
inger
speaks
up
a
little
timidly
again
seeing
no
doubt
what
is
troubling
him
what
if
we
both
hang
on
the
stick
there
and
the
thing
she
calls
a
stick
is
the
lever
nothing
else
no
cries
isak
furiously
but
after
a
moment
thought
he
says
well
well
since
you
here
though
you
might
as
well
have
gone
home
let
try
and
they
get
the
stone
up
on
edge
ay
they
manage
that
and
puh
says
isak
but
now
comes
a
revelation
a
strange
thing
to
see
the
underside
of
the
stone
is
flat
mightily
broad
finely
cut
smooth
and
even
as
a
floor
the
stone
is
but
the
half
of
a
stone
the
other
half
is
somewhere
close
by
no
doubt
isak
knows
well
enough
that
two
halves
of
the
same
stone
may
lie
in
different
places
the
frost
no
doubt
that
in
course
of
time
had
shifted
them
apart
but
he
is
all
wonder
and
delight
at
the
find
is
a
useful
stone
of
the
best
a
a
round
sum
of
money
would
not
have
filled
this
fieldworker
mind
with
such
content
a
fine
says
he
proudly
and
inger
simple
creature
why
now
how
on
earth
could
you
tell
that
beforehand
h
says
isak
think
i
go
here
digging
about
for
nothing
they
walk
home
together
isak
enjoying
new
admiration
on
false
pretences
was
something
he
had
not
deserved
but
it
tasted
but
little
different
from
the
real
thing
he
lets
it
be
understood
that
he
has
been
looking
out
for
a
suitable
for
a
long
time
and
had
found
it
at
last
after
that
of
course
there
could
be
nothing
in
the
least
suspicious
about
his
working
there
again
he
could
root
about
as
much
as
he
pleased
on
pretext
of
looking
for
the
other
half
and
when
sivert
came
home
he
could
get
him
to
help
but
if
it
had
come
to
this
that
he
could
no
longer
go
out
alone
and
heave
up
a
stone
why
things
were
sorely
changed
ay
was
a
bad
and
the
more
need
to
get
that
site
cleared
quick
as
might
be
age
was
upon
him
he
was
ripening
for
the
the
triumph
he
had
stolen
in
the
matter
of
the
faded
away
in
a
few
days
was
a
false
thing
and
not
made
to
last
isak
stooped
a
little
now
in
his
walk
had
he
not
once
been
so
much
of
a
man
that
he
grew
wakeful
and
attentive
in
a
moment
if
one
but
said
a
word
of
stone
a
word
of
digging
and
was
no
long
time
since
but
a
few
years
no
more
ay
and
in
those
days
folk
that
were
shy
of
a
bit
of
draining
work
kept
out
of
his
way
now
he
was
beginning
little
by
little
to
take
such
matters
more
calmly
eyah
all
things
were
changed
the
land
itself
was
different
now
with
broad
telegraph
roads
up
through
the
woods
that
had
not
been
there
before
and
rocks
blasted
and
sundered
up
by
the
water
as
they
had
not
been
before
and
folk
too
were
changed
they
did
not
greet
coming
and
going
as
in
the
old
days
but
nodded
only
or
maybe
not
even
that
but
then
in
the
old
days
there
had
been
no
sellanraa
but
only
a
turf
hut
while
now
there
had
been
no
margrave
in
the
old
days
ay
but
margrave
what
was
he
now
a
pitiful
thing
nothing
superhuman
but
old
and
fading
going
the
way
of
all
flesh
what
though
he
had
good
bowels
and
could
eat
well
when
it
gave
him
no
strength
was
sivert
had
the
strength
now
and
a
mercy
it
was
so
but
think
if
isak
had
had
it
too
a
sorry
thing
to
find
his
works
running
down
he
had
toiled
like
a
man
carrying
loads
enough
for
any
beast
of
burden
now
he
could
exercise
his
patience
in
resting
isak
is
heavy
at
heart
here
lies
an
old
hat
an
old
rotting
on
the
ground
carried
there
by
the
gale
maybe
or
maybe
the
lads
had
brought
it
there
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
years
ago
when
they
were
little
ones
it
lies
there
year
after
year
rotting
and
rotting
away
but
once
it
had
been
a
new
all
yellow
and
new
isak
remembers
the
day
he
came
home
with
it
from
the
store
and
inger
had
said
it
was
a
fine
hat
a
year
or
so
after
he
had
taken
it
to
a
painter
down
in
the
village
and
had
it
blacked
and
polished
and
the
brim
done
in
green
and
when
he
came
home
inger
thought
it
a
finer
hat
than
before
inger
always
thought
everything
was
fine
ay
was
a
good
life
those
days
cutting
faggots
with
inger
to
look
on
his
best
days
and
when
march
and
april
came
inger
and
he
would
be
wild
after
each
other
just
like
the
birds
and
beasts
in
the
woods
and
when
may
was
come
he
would
sow
his
corn
and
plant
potatoes
living
and
thriving
from
day
to
dawn
work
and
sleep
loving
and
dreaming
he
was
like
the
first
big
ox
and
that
was
a
wonder
to
see
big
and
bright
as
a
king
but
there
was
no
such
may
to
the
years
now
no
such
thing
isak
was
sorely
despondent
for
some
days
dark
days
they
were
he
felt
neither
wish
nor
strength
to
start
work
on
the
fodder
loft
that
could
be
left
for
sivert
to
do
some
day
the
thing
to
be
done
now
was
the
house
for
himself
the
last
house
to
build
he
could
not
long
hide
from
sivert
what
he
was
doing
he
was
clearing
the
ground
and
plain
to
see
what
for
and
one
day
he
told
there
a
good
bit
of
stone
if
we
any
use
for
stonework
said
he
and
there
another
sivert
showed
no
surprise
and
only
said
ay
stones
what
you
might
think
said
his
father
we
been
digging
round
here
now
to
find
that
other
piece
might
almost
do
to
build
here
i
do
know
ay
is
no
bad
place
to
build
said
sivert
looking
round
think
so
was
none
so
bad
maybe
to
have
a
bit
of
a
place
to
house
folk
if
any
should
come
along
ay
a
couple
of
rooms
be
as
well
you
saw
how
was
when
they
swedish
gentlemen
came
and
no
proper
place
to
house
them
but
what
you
think
a
bit
of
a
kitchen
as
well
maybe
if
was
any
cooking
to
be
done
ay
be
a
shame
to
built
with
never
a
bit
of
kitchen
says
sivert
you
think
so
isak
said
no
more
but
sivert
he
was
a
fine
lad
to
grasp
things
and
get
into
his
head
all
at
once
just
what
was
needed
in
a
place
to
put
up
swedish
gentlemen
that
chanced
to
come
along
never
so
much
as
asked
a
single
question
but
only
said
doing
it
my
way
now
put
up
a
bit
of
a
shed
on
the
north
wall
folks
coming
along
be
useful
to
have
a
shed
place
to
hang
up
wet
clothes
and
things
and
his
father
agrees
at
once
ay
the
very
thing
they
work
at
their
stones
again
in
silence
then
asks
isak
eleseus
he
not
come
home
i
suppose
and
sivert
answers
evasively
he
be
coming
home
soon
was
that
way
with
eleseus
he
was
all
for
staying
away
living
away
on
journeys
could
he
have
written
for
the
goods
but
he
must
go
round
and
buy
them
on
the
spot
got
them
so
much
cheaper
ay
maybe
but
what
about
cost
of
the
journey
he
had
his
own
way
of
thinking
it
seemed
and
then
what
did
he
want
anyway
with
more
cotton
stuff
and
coloured
ribbons
for
christening
caps
and
black
and
white
straw
hats
and
long
tobacco
pipes
no
one
ever
bought
such
things
up
in
the
hills
and
the
village
folk
they
only
came
up
to
storborg
when
no
money
eleseus
was
clever
enough
in
his
way
only
to
see
him
write
on
a
paper
or
do
sums
with
a
bit
of
chalk
ay
with
a
head
like
yours
said
folk
admiring
him
and
that
was
true
enough
but
he
was
spending
overmuch
they
village
folk
never
paid
their
owings
and
yet
even
a
fellow
like
brede
olsen
could
come
up
to
storborg
that
winter
and
get
cotton
print
and
coffee
and
molasses
and
paraffin
on
credit
isak
has
laid
out
a
deal
of
money
already
for
eleseus
and
his
store
and
his
long
journeyings
about
there
not
overmuch
left
now
out
of
the
riches
from
the
mine
and
what
then
how
think
he
getting
on
eleseus
asks
isak
suddenly
getting
on
says
sivert
to
gain
time
does
seem
to
be
doing
so
well
h
he
says
it
go
all
right
you
spoken
to
him
about
it
nay
but
andresen
he
says
so
isak
thought
over
this
and
shook
his
head
nay
i
doubt
it
going
ill
says
he
tis
a
pity
for
the
lad
and
isak
gloomier
than
ever
now
for
all
he
been
none
too
bright
before
but
then
sivert
flashes
out
a
bit
of
news
there
more
folk
coming
to
live
now
how
say
two
new
holdings
they
bought
up
close
by
us
isak
stands
still
with
his
crowbar
in
hand
this
was
news
and
good
news
the
best
that
could
be
that
makes
ten
of
us
here
says
he
and
isak
learns
exactly
where
the
new
men
have
bought
he
knows
the
country
all
round
in
his
head
and
nods
ay
they
done
well
there
wood
for
firing
in
plenty
and
some
big
timber
here
and
there
ground
slopes
down
ay
settlers
nothing
could
beat
them
anyway
here
were
new
folk
coming
to
live
the
mine
had
come
to
nothing
but
so
much
the
better
for
the
land
a
desert
a
dying
place
far
from
it
all
about
was
swarming
with
life
two
new
men
four
new
hands
to
work
fields
and
meadows
and
homes
oh
the
little
green
tracts
in
a
forest
a
hut
and
water
children
and
cattle
about
corn
waving
on
the
moorlands
where
naught
but
horsetail
grew
before
bluebells
nodding
on
the
fells
and
yellow
sunlight
blazing
in
the
ladyslipper
flowers
outside
a
house
and
human
beings
living
there
move
and
talk
and
think
and
are
there
with
heaven
and
earth
here
stands
the
first
of
them
all
the
first
man
in
the
wilds
he
came
that
way
kneedeep
in
and
heather
found
a
sunny
slope
and
settled
there
others
came
after
him
they
trod
a
path
across
the
waste
others
again
and
the
path
became
a
road
carts
drove
there
now
isak
may
be
content
may
start
with
a
little
thrill
of
pride
he
was
the
founder
of
a
district
the
pioneer
look
here
we
ca
go
wasting
time
on
this
bit
of
a
house
place
if
we
to
get
that
fodder
loft
done
this
year
says
he
with
a
new
brightness
new
spirit
as
it
were
new
courage
and
life
chapter
x
a
woman
tramping
up
along
the
road
a
steady
summer
rain
falls
wetting
her
but
she
does
not
heed
it
other
things
are
in
her
mind
anxiety
barbro
it
is
and
no
other
brede
girl
barbro
anxious
ay
not
knowing
how
the
venture
will
end
she
has
gone
from
service
at
the
lensmand
and
left
the
village
that
is
the
matter
she
keeps
away
from
all
the
farms
on
the
road
up
unwilling
to
meet
with
folk
easy
to
see
where
she
was
going
with
a
bundle
of
clothing
on
her
back
ay
going
to
maaneland
to
take
service
there
again
ten
months
she
has
been
at
the
lensmand
now
and
is
no
little
time
reckoned
out
in
days
and
nights
but
an
eternity
reckoned
in
longing
and
oppression
it
had
been
bearable
at
first
fru
heyerdahl
looking
after
her
kindly
giving
her
aprons
and
neat
things
to
wear
a
joy
to
be
sent
on
errands
to
the
store
with
such
fine
clothes
to
wear
barbro
had
been
in
the
village
as
a
child
she
knew
all
the
village
folk
from
the
days
when
she
had
played
there
gone
to
school
there
kissed
the
lads
there
and
joined
in
many
games
with
stones
and
shells
bearable
enough
for
a
month
or
so
but
then
fru
heyerdahl
had
begun
to
be
even
more
careful
about
her
and
when
the
christmas
festivities
began
she
was
strict
and
what
good
could
ever
come
of
that
it
was
bound
to
spoil
things
barbro
could
never
have
endured
it
but
that
she
had
certain
hours
of
the
night
to
herself
from
two
to
six
in
the
morning
she
was
more
or
less
safe
and
had
stolen
pleasures
not
a
few
what
about
cook
then
for
not
reporting
her
a
nice
sort
of
woman
she
must
be
oh
an
ordinary
woman
enough
as
the
world
finds
them
cook
went
out
without
leave
herself
they
took
it
in
turns
and
it
was
quite
a
long
time
before
they
were
found
out
barbro
was
by
no
means
so
depraved
that
it
showed
in
her
face
impossible
to
accuse
her
of
immorality
immorality
she
made
all
the
resistance
one
could
expect
when
young
men
asked
her
to
go
to
a
christmas
dance
she
said
no
once
said
no
twice
but
the
third
time
she
would
say
try
and
come
from
two
to
six
just
as
a
decent
woman
should
not
trying
to
make
herself
out
worse
than
she
is
and
making
a
display
of
daring
she
was
a
serving
all
her
time
and
knew
no
other
recreation
than
fooling
with
men
it
was
all
she
asked
for
fru
heyerdahl
came
and
lectured
her
lent
her
books
and
a
fool
for
her
pains
barbro
had
lived
in
bergen
and
read
the
papers
and
been
to
the
theatre
she
was
no
innocent
lamb
from
the
countryside
but
fru
heyerdahl
must
have
grown
suspicious
at
last
one
day
she
comes
up
at
three
in
the
morning
to
the
maids
room
and
calls
barbro
yes
answers
cook
it
barbro
i
want
is
she
there
open
the
door
cook
opens
the
door
and
explains
as
agreed
upon
that
barbro
had
had
to
run
home
for
a
minute
about
something
home
for
a
minute
at
this
time
of
night
fru
heyerdahl
has
a
good
deal
to
say
about
that
and
in
the
morning
there
is
a
scene
brede
is
sent
for
and
fru
heyerdahl
asks
was
barbro
at
home
with
you
last
night
at
three
brede
is
unprepared
but
answers
three
yes
yes
quite
right
we
sat
up
late
there
was
something
we
had
to
talk
about
says
brede
the
lensmand
lady
then
solemnly
declares
that
barbro
shall
go
out
no
more
at
nights
no
no
says
brede
not
as
long
as
she
in
this
house
no
no
there
you
can
see
barbro
i
told
you
so
says
her
father
you
can
go
and
see
your
parents
now
and
then
during
the
day
says
her
mistress
but
fru
heyerdahl
was
wide
awake
enough
and
her
suspicion
was
not
gone
she
waited
a
week
and
tried
at
four
in
the
morning
barbro
she
called
oh
but
this
time
was
cook
turn
out
and
barbro
was
at
home
the
maids
room
was
a
nest
of
innocence
her
mistress
had
to
hit
on
something
in
a
hurry
did
you
take
in
the
washing
last
night
yes
that
a
good
thing
it
blowing
so
hard
but
it
was
not
so
pleasant
for
fru
heyerdahl
to
get
her
husband
to
wake
her
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
go
padding
across
herself
to
the
servants
room
to
see
if
they
were
at
home
they
could
do
as
they
pleased
she
would
trouble
herself
no
more
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
sheer
barbro
might
have
stayed
the
year
out
in
her
place
that
way
but
a
few
days
ago
the
trouble
had
come
it
was
in
the
kitchen
early
one
morning
barbro
had
been
having
some
words
with
cook
and
no
light
words
either
they
raised
their
voices
forgetting
all
about
their
mistress
cook
was
a
mean
thing
and
a
cheat
she
had
sneaked
off
last
night
out
of
her
turn
because
it
was
sunday
and
what
excuse
had
she
to
give
going
to
say
to
her
favourite
sister
that
was
off
to
america
not
a
bit
of
it
cook
had
made
no
excuse
at
all
but
simply
said
that
sunday
night
was
one
had
been
owing
to
her
for
a
long
time
oh
you
not
an
atom
of
truth
nor
decency
in
your
body
said
barbro
and
there
was
the
mistress
in
the
doorway
she
had
come
out
perhaps
with
no
more
thought
than
that
the
girls
were
making
too
much
noise
but
now
she
stood
looking
very
closely
at
barbro
at
barbro
apron
over
her
breast
ay
leaning
forward
and
looking
very
closely
indeed
it
was
a
painful
moment
and
suddenly
fru
heyerdahl
screams
and
draws
back
to
the
door
what
on
earth
can
it
be
thinks
barbro
and
looks
down
at
herself
a
flea
nothing
more
barbro
can
not
help
smiling
and
being
not
unused
to
acting
under
critical
circumstances
she
flicks
off
the
flea
at
once
on
the
floor
cried
fru
heyerdahl
are
you
mad
girl
pick
it
up
at
once
barbro
begins
looking
about
for
it
and
once
more
acts
with
presence
of
mind
she
makes
as
if
she
had
caught
the
creature
and
drops
it
realistically
into
the
fire
where
did
you
get
it
asks
her
mistress
angrily
where
i
got
it
yes
that
what
i
want
to
know
but
here
barbro
makes
a
bad
mistake
at
the
store
she
ought
to
have
said
of
course
that
would
have
been
quite
enough
as
it
was
she
did
not
know
where
she
had
got
the
creature
but
had
an
idea
it
must
have
been
from
cook
cook
at
the
height
of
passion
at
once
from
me
you
please
to
keep
your
fleas
to
yourself
so
there
anyway
was
you
was
out
last
night
another
mistake
she
should
have
said
nothing
about
it
cook
has
no
longer
any
reason
for
keeping
silence
and
now
she
let
out
the
whole
thing
and
told
all
about
the
nights
barbro
had
been
out
fru
heyerdahl
mightily
indignant
she
cares
nothing
about
cook
is
barbro
she
is
after
the
girl
whose
character
she
has
answered
for
and
even
then
all
might
have
been
well
if
barbro
had
bowed
her
head
like
a
reed
and
been
cast
down
with
shame
and
promised
all
manner
of
things
for
the
future
but
no
her
mistress
is
forced
to
remind
her
of
all
she
has
done
for
her
and
at
that
if
you
please
barbro
falls
to
answering
back
ay
so
foolish
was
she
saying
impertinent
things
or
perhaps
she
was
cleverer
than
might
seem
trying
on
purpose
maybe
to
bring
the
matter
to
a
head
and
get
out
of
the
place
altogether
says
her
mistress
after
i
saved
you
from
the
clutches
of
the
law
as
for
that
answers
barbro
i
have
just
as
pleased
if
you
had
and
that
all
the
thanks
i
get
says
her
mistress
least
said
the
better
perhaps
says
barbro
i
would
have
got
more
than
a
month
or
two
anyway
and
done
with
it
fru
heyerdahl
is
speechless
for
a
moment
ay
for
a
little
while
she
stands
saying
nothing
only
opening
and
closing
her
mouth
the
first
thing
she
says
is
to
tell
the
girl
to
go
she
will
have
no
more
of
her
just
as
you
please
says
barbro
for
some
days
after
that
barbro
had
been
at
home
with
her
parents
but
she
could
not
go
on
staying
there
true
her
mother
sold
coffee
and
there
came
a
deal
of
folk
to
the
house
but
barbro
could
not
live
on
that
and
maybe
she
had
other
reasons
of
her
own
for
wanting
to
get
into
a
settled
position
again
and
so
today
she
had
taken
a
sack
of
clothes
on
her
back
and
started
up
along
the
road
over
the
moors
question
now
whether
axel
str√∂m
would
take
her
but
she
had
had
the
banns
put
up
anyway
the
sunday
before
raining
and
dirty
underfoot
but
barbro
tramps
on
evening
is
drawing
on
but
not
dark
yet
at
that
season
of
the
year
poor
barbro
she
does
not
spare
herself
but
goes
on
her
errand
like
another
she
is
bound
for
a
place
to
commence
another
struggle
there
she
has
never
spared
herself
to
tell
the
truth
never
been
of
a
lazy
sort
and
that
is
why
she
has
her
neat
figure
now
and
pretty
shape
barbro
is
quick
to
learn
things
and
often
to
her
own
undoing
what
else
could
one
expect
she
had
learned
to
save
herself
at
a
pinch
to
slip
from
one
scrape
to
another
but
keeping
all
along
some
better
qualities
a
child
death
is
nothing
to
her
but
she
can
still
give
sweets
to
a
child
alive
then
she
has
a
fine
musical
ear
can
strum
softly
and
correctly
on
a
guitar
singing
hoarsely
the
while
pleasant
and
slightly
mournful
to
hear
spared
herself
no
so
little
indeed
that
she
has
thrown
herself
away
altogether
and
felt
no
loss
now
and
again
she
cries
and
breaks
her
heart
over
this
or
that
in
her
life
but
that
is
only
natural
it
goes
with
the
songs
she
sings
is
the
poetry
and
friendly
sweetness
in
her
she
had
fooled
herself
and
many
another
with
the
same
had
she
been
able
to
bring
the
guitar
with
her
this
evening
she
could
have
strummed
a
little
for
axel
when
she
came
she
manages
so
as
to
arrive
late
in
the
evening
all
is
quiet
at
maaneland
when
she
reaches
there
see
axel
has
already
begun
haymaking
the
grass
is
cut
near
the
house
and
some
of
the
hay
already
in
and
then
she
reckons
out
that
oline
being
old
will
be
sleeping
in
the
little
room
and
axel
lying
out
in
the
hayshed
just
as
she
herself
had
done
she
goes
to
the
door
she
knows
so
well
breathless
as
a
thief
and
calls
softly
axel
what
that
asks
axel
all
at
once
nay
is
only
me
says
barbro
and
steps
in
you
could
house
me
for
the
night
she
says
axel
looks
at
her
and
is
slow
to
think
and
sits
there
in
his
underclothes
looking
at
her
so
is
you
says
he
and
you
be
going
why
depends
first
of
all
if
you
need
of
help
to
the
summer
work
says
she
axel
thinks
over
that
and
says
are
you
going
to
stay
where
you
were
then
nay
i
finished
at
the
lensmand
i
might
be
needing
help
true
enough
for
the
summer
said
axel
but
what
it
mean
anyway
you
wanting
to
come
back
nay
never
mind
me
says
barbro
putting
it
off
i
go
on
again
tomorrow
go
to
sellanraa
and
cross
the
hills
i
a
place
there
you
fixed
up
with
some
one
there
ay
i
might
be
needing
summer
help
myself
says
axel
again
barbro
is
wet
through
she
has
other
clothes
in
her
sack
and
must
change
do
mind
about
me
says
axel
and
moves
a
bit
toward
the
door
no
more
barbro
takes
off
her
wet
clothes
they
talking
the
while
and
axel
turning
his
head
pretty
often
towards
her
now
you
better
go
out
just
a
bit
says
she
out
says
he
and
indeed
was
no
weather
to
go
out
in
he
stands
there
seeing
her
more
and
more
stripped
is
hard
to
keep
his
eyes
away
and
barbro
is
so
thoughtless
she
might
well
have
put
on
dry
things
bit
by
bit
as
she
took
oft
the
wet
but
no
her
shift
is
thin
and
clings
to
her
she
unfastens
a
button
at
one
shoulder
and
turns
aside
is
nothing
new
for
her
axel
dead
silent
then
and
he
sees
how
she
makes
but
a
touch
or
two
with
her
hands
and
washes
the
last
of
her
clothes
from
her
was
splendidly
done
to
his
mind
and
there
she
stands
so
utterly
thoughtless
of
her
a
while
after
they
lay
talking
together
ay
he
had
need
of
help
for
the
summer
no
doubt
about
that
they
said
something
that
way
says
barbro
he
had
begun
his
mowing
and
haymaking
all
alone
again
barbro
could
judge
for
herself
how
awkward
it
was
for
him
ay
barbro
on
the
other
hand
it
was
barbro
herself
that
had
run
away
and
left
him
before
without
a
soul
to
help
him
he
ca
forget
that
and
taken
her
rings
with
her
into
the
bargain
and
on
top
of
all
that
shameful
as
it
was
the
paper
that
kept
on
coming
that
bergen
newspaper
it
seemed
he
would
never
get
rid
of
he
had
had
to
go
on
paying
for
it
a
whole
year
after
was
shameful
mean
of
them
says
barbro
taking
his
part
all
the
time
but
seeing
her
all
submissive
and
gentle
axel
himself
could
not
be
altogether
heartless
towards
her
he
agreed
that
barbro
might
have
some
reason
to
be
angry
with
him
in
return
for
the
way
he
had
taken
the
telegraph
business
from
her
father
but
as
for
that
said
he
your
father
can
have
the
telegraph
business
again
for
me
i
have
no
more
of
it
is
but
a
waste
of
time
ay
says
barbro
axel
thought
for
a
while
then
asked
straight
out
well
what
about
it
now
would
you
want
to
come
for
the
summer
and
no
more
nay
says
barbro
let
it
be
as
you
please
you
mean
that
and
truly
ay
just
as
you
please
and
i
be
pleased
with
the
same
you
no
call
to
doubt
about
me
any
more
h
no
is
true
and
i
ordered
about
the
banns
h
this
was
not
so
bad
axel
lay
thinking
it
over
a
long
time
if
she
meant
it
in
earnest
this
time
and
not
shameful
deceit
again
then
he
a
woman
of
his
own
and
help
for
as
long
as
might
be
i
could
get
a
woman
to
come
from
our
parts
said
he
and
written
saying
she
come
but
then
i
have
to
pay
her
fare
from
america
says
barbro
ho
she
in
america
then
ay
went
over
last
year
she
did
but
does
care
to
stay
never
mind
about
her
says
barbro
and
what
become
of
me
then
says
she
and
begins
to
be
soft
and
mournful
no
that
why
i
not
fixed
up
all
certain
with
her
and
after
that
barbro
must
have
something
to
show
in
return
she
confessed
about
how
she
could
have
taken
a
lad
in
bergen
and
he
was
a
carter
in
a
big
brewery
a
mighty
big
concern
and
a
good
position
and
he
be
sorrowing
for
me
now
i
doubt
says
barbro
and
makes
a
little
sob
but
you
know
how
is
axel
when
there
two
been
so
much
together
as
you
and
i
is
more
than
i
could
ever
forget
and
you
can
forget
me
as
much
as
you
please
what
me
says
axel
nay
no
need
to
lie
there
crying
for
that
my
girl
for
i
never
forgot
you
well
barbro
feels
a
deal
better
after
that
confession
and
says
anyway
paying
her
fare
all
the
way
from
america
when
there
no
need
she
advises
him
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
business
be
over
costly
and
there
was
no
need
barbro
seemed
resolved
to
build
up
his
happiness
herself
they
came
to
agreement
all
round
in
the
course
of
the
night
was
not
as
if
they
were
strangers
they
had
talked
over
everything
before
even
the
necessary
marriage
ceremony
was
to
take
place
before
olaf
day
and
harvest
they
had
no
need
to
hide
things
and
barbro
was
now
herself
most
eager
to
get
it
done
at
once
axel
was
not
any
put
out
at
her
eagerness
and
it
did
not
make
him
any
way
suspicious
far
from
it
he
was
flattered
and
encouraged
to
find
her
so
ay
he
was
a
worker
in
the
fields
no
doubt
a
fellow
not
used
to
looking
over
fine
at
things
nothing
delicate
beyond
measure
there
were
things
he
was
obliged
to
do
and
he
looked
to
what
was
useful
first
of
all
moreover
here
was
barbro
all
new
and
pretty
again
and
nice
to
him
almost
sweeter
than
before
like
an
apple
she
was
and
he
bit
at
it
the
banns
were
already
put
up
as
to
the
dead
child
and
the
trial
neither
said
a
word
of
that
but
they
did
speak
of
oline
of
how
they
were
to
get
rid
of
her
ay
she
must
go
said
barbro
we
nothing
to
thank
her
for
anyway
she
naught
but
and
malice
but
it
proved
no
easy
matter
to
get
oline
to
go
the
very
first
morning
when
barbro
appeared
oline
was
clear
no
doubt
as
to
her
fate
she
was
troubled
at
once
but
tried
not
to
show
it
and
brought
out
a
chair
they
had
managed
up
to
then
at
maaneland
axel
had
carried
water
and
wood
and
done
the
heaviest
work
and
oline
doing
the
rest
and
gradually
she
had
come
to
reckon
on
staying
the
rest
of
her
life
on
the
place
now
came
barbro
and
upset
it
all
if
we
only
a
grain
of
coffee
in
the
house
you
should
have
it
said
she
to
barbro
going
farther
up
maybe
no
said
barbro
ho
not
going
farther
no
why
is
no
business
of
mine
no
says
oline
going
down
again
maybe
no
nor
going
down
again
i
staying
here
for
now
staying
here
are
you
ay
staying
here
i
doubt
oline
waits
for
a
moment
using
her
old
head
full
of
policy
ay
well
says
she
save
me
then
no
doubt
and
glad
i
be
for
the
same
oho
says
barbro
in
jest
has
axel
here
been
so
hard
on
you
this
while
hard
on
me
axel
oh
there
no
call
to
turn
an
old
body
words
there
naught
but
living
on
and
waiting
for
the
blessed
end
axel
that
been
as
a
father
and
a
messenger
from
the
highest
to
me
day
and
hour
together
and
gospel
truth
the
same
but
seeing
i
none
of
my
own
folks
here
and
living
alone
and
rejected
under
a
stranger
roof
with
all
my
kin
over
across
the
hills
but
for
all
that
oline
stayed
on
they
could
not
get
rid
of
her
till
after
they
were
wed
and
oline
made
a
deal
of
reluctance
but
said
yes
at
last
and
would
stay
so
long
to
please
them
and
look
to
house
and
cattle
while
they
went
down
to
the
church
it
took
two
days
but
when
they
came
back
wedded
and
all
oline
stayed
on
as
before
she
put
off
going
one
day
she
was
feeling
poorly
she
said
the
next
it
looked
like
rain
she
made
up
to
barbro
with
smooth
words
about
the
food
oh
there
was
a
mighty
difference
in
the
food
now
at
maaneland
different
living
now
and
a
mighty
difference
in
the
coffee
now
oh
she
stopped
at
nothing
that
oline
asked
barbro
advice
on
things
she
knew
better
herself
what
you
think
now
should
i
milk
cows
as
they
stand
in
their
place
and
order
or
should
i
take
cow
bordelin
first
you
can
do
as
you
please
ay
is
as
i
always
said
exclaims
oline
you
been
out
in
the
world
and
lived
among
great
folks
and
fine
folks
and
learned
all
and
everything
is
different
with
the
likes
of
me
ay
oline
stopped
at
nothing
she
was
intriguing
all
day
long
sitting
there
telling
barbro
how
she
herself
was
friends
and
on
the
best
of
terms
with
barbro
father
with
brede
olsen
ho
many
a
pleasant
hour
they
had
together
and
a
kindly
man
and
rich
and
grand
to
boot
was
brede
and
never
a
hard
word
in
his
mouth
but
this
could
not
go
on
for
ever
neither
axel
nor
barbro
cared
to
have
oline
there
any
longer
and
barbro
had
taken
over
all
her
work
oline
made
no
complaint
but
she
flashed
dangerous
glances
at
her
young
mistress
and
changed
her
tone
ever
so
little
ay
great
folk
is
true
axel
he
was
in
town
a
while
last
you
did
meet
him
there
maybe
nay
that
true
you
were
in
bergen
that
time
but
he
went
into
town
he
did
was
all
to
buy
a
and
a
and
what
folk
at
sellanraa
now
beside
you
here
nothing
to
compare
she
was
beginning
to
shoot
out
little
pinpricks
but
even
that
did
not
help
her
now
neither
of
them
feared
her
axel
told
her
straight
out
one
day
that
she
must
go
go
says
oline
and
how
crawling
belike
no
she
would
not
go
saying
by
way
of
excuse
that
she
was
poorly
and
could
not
move
her
legs
and
to
make
things
bad
as
could
be
when
once
they
had
taken
the
work
off
her
hands
and
she
had
nothing
to
do
at
all
she
collapsed
and
was
thoroughly
she
kept
about
for
a
week
in
spite
of
it
axel
looking
furiously
at
her
but
she
stayed
on
from
sheer
malice
and
at
last
she
had
to
take
to
her
bed
and
now
she
lay
there
not
in
the
least
awaiting
her
blessed
end
but
counting
the
hours
till
she
should
be
up
and
about
again
she
asked
for
a
doctor
a
piece
of
extravagance
unheard
of
in
the
wilds
doctor
said
axel
are
you
out
of
your
senses
how
mean
then
said
oline
quite
gently
as
to
something
she
could
not
understand
ay
so
gentle
and
was
she
so
glad
to
think
she
need
not
be
a
burden
to
others
she
could
pay
for
the
doctor
herself
ho
can
you
said
axel
why
and
could
i
then
says
oline
and
anyway
you
not
have
me
lie
here
and
die
like
a
dumb
beast
in
the
face
of
the
lord
here
barbro
put
in
a
word
and
was
unwise
enough
to
say
well
what
you
got
to
complain
of
i
like
to
know
when
i
bring
you
in
your
meals
and
all
myself
as
for
coffee
i
said
better
without
it
and
meaning
well
is
that
barbro
says
oline
turning
just
her
eyes
and
no
more
to
look
for
her
ay
she
is
poorly
is
oline
and
a
pitiful
sight
with
her
eyes
screwed
round
cornerways
ay
maybe
is
as
you
say
barbro
if
a
tiny
drop
of
coffee
do
me
any
harm
a
spoonful
and
no
more
if
was
me
in
your
stead
i
be
thinking
of
other
things
than
coffee
at
this
hour
says
barbro
ay
is
as
i
say
answers
oline
was
never
your
way
to
wish
and
desire
a
end
but
rather
they
should
be
converted
and
live
what
ay
i
lying
here
and
seeing
things
is
it
with
child
you
are
now
barbro
what
that
you
say
cries
barbro
furiously
and
goes
on
again
oh
serve
you
right
if
i
took
and
heaved
you
out
on
the
for
your
wicked
tongue
and
at
that
the
invalid
was
silent
for
one
thoughtful
moment
her
mouth
trembling
as
if
trying
so
hard
to
smile
but
dare
not
i
heard
a
some
one
calling
last
night
says
she
she
out
of
her
senses
says
axel
whispering
nay
out
of
my
senses
that
i
not
like
some
one
calling
it
was
from
the
woods
or
maybe
from
the
stream
up
yonder
strange
to
hear
as
it
might
be
a
bit
of
a
child
crying
out
was
that
barbro
went
out
ay
says
axel
sick
of
your
nonsense
and
no
wonder
nonsense
you
call
it
and
out
of
my
senses
and
all
ah
but
not
so
far
as
you
like
to
think
says
oline
nay
is
not
the
will
and
decree
i
should
come
before
the
throne
and
before
the
lamb
as
yet
with
all
i
know
of
here
at
maaneland
i
be
up
and
about
again
never
fear
but
you
better
be
fetching
a
doctor
axel
quicker
that
way
what
about
that
cow
you
were
going
to
give
me
cow
what
cow
that
cow
you
promised
me
was
it
bordelin
maybe
you
talking
wild
says
axel
you
know
how
you
promised
me
a
cow
the
day
i
saved
your
life
nay
that
i
never
knew
at
that
oline
lifts
up
her
head
and
looks
at
him
grey
and
bald
she
is
a
head
standing
up
on
a
long
scraggy
neck
ugly
as
a
witch
as
an
ogress
out
of
a
story
and
axel
starts
at
the
sight
and
fumbles
with
a
hand
behind
his
back
for
the
latch
of
the
door
ho
says
oline
so
you
that
sort
ay
well
say
no
more
of
it
now
i
can
live
without
the
cow
from
this
day
forth
and
never
a
word
i
say
nor
breathe
of
it
again
but
well
that
you
shown
what
sort
and
manner
of
man
you
are
this
day
i
know
it
now
ay
and
i
know
it
another
time
but
oline
she
died
that
night
some
time
in
the
night
anyway
she
was
cold
next
morning
when
they
came
in
oline
an
aged
creature
born
and
died
no
sorrow
to
axel
nor
barbro
to
bury
her
and
be
quit
of
her
for
ever
there
was
less
to
be
on
their
guard
against
now
they
could
be
at
rest
barbro
is
having
trouble
with
her
teeth
again
save
for
that
all
is
well
but
that
everlasting
woollen
muffler
over
her
face
and
shifting
it
aside
every
time
there
a
word
to
say
was
plaguy
and
troublesome
enough
and
all
this
toothache
is
something
of
a
mystery
to
axel
he
has
noticed
certainly
that
she
chews
her
food
in
a
careful
sort
of
way
but
there
not
a
tooth
missing
in
her
head
did
you
get
new
teeth
he
asks
ay
so
i
did
and
are
they
aching
too
ah
you
with
your
nonsense
says
barbro
irritably
for
all
that
axel
has
asked
innocently
enough
and
in
her
bitterness
she
lets
out
what
is
the
matter
you
can
see
how
is
with
me
surely
how
was
with
her
axel
looks
closer
and
fancies
she
is
stouter
than
need
be
why
you
ca
be
is
surely
not
another
child
again
says
he
why
you
know
it
is
says
she
axel
stares
foolishly
at
her
slow
of
thought
as
he
is
he
sits
there
counting
for
a
bit
one
week
two
weeks
getting
on
the
third
week
nay
how
i
should
know
says
he
but
barbro
is
losing
all
patience
with
this
debate
and
bursts
out
crying
aloud
crying
like
a
deeply
injured
creature
nay
you
can
take
and
bury
me
too
in
the
ground
and
then
you
be
rid
of
me
strange
what
odd
things
a
woman
can
find
to
cry
for
axel
had
never
a
thought
of
burying
her
in
the
ground
he
is
a
fellow
looking
mainly
to
what
is
useful
a
pathway
carpeted
with
flowers
is
beyond
his
needs
then
you
not
be
fit
to
work
in
the
fields
this
summer
says
he
not
work
says
barbro
all
terrified
again
and
then
strange
what
odd
things
a
woman
can
find
to
smile
for
axel
taking
it
that
way
sent
a
flow
of
hysterical
joy
through
barbro
and
she
burst
out
work
for
two
oh
you
wait
and
see
axel
i
do
all
you
set
me
to
and
more
beyond
wear
myself
to
the
bone
i
will
and
be
thankful
if
only
you
put
up
with
me
so
more
tears
and
smiles
and
tenderness
after
that
only
the
two
of
them
in
the
wilds
none
to
disturb
them
open
doors
and
a
humming
of
flies
in
the
summer
heat
all
so
tender
and
willing
was
barbro
ay
he
might
do
as
he
pleased
with
her
and
she
was
willing
after
sunset
he
stands
harnessing
up
to
the
there
a
bit
he
can
still
get
done
ready
for
tomorrow
barbro
comes
hurrying
out
as
if
she
something
important
and
says
axel
how
ever
could
you
think
of
getting
one
home
from
america
she
could
get
here
before
winter
and
what
use
of
her
then
and
that
was
something
had
just
come
into
her
head
and
she
must
come
running
out
with
it
as
if
was
something
needful
but
was
no
way
needful
axel
had
seen
from
the
first
that
taking
barbro
would
mean
getting
help
for
all
the
year
no
swaying
and
swinging
with
axel
no
thinking
with
his
head
among
the
stars
now
he
a
woman
of
his
own
to
look
after
the
place
he
can
keep
on
the
telegraph
business
for
a
bit
is
a
deal
of
money
in
the
year
and
good
to
reckon
with
as
long
as
he
barely
enough
for
his
needs
from
the
land
and
little
to
sell
all
sound
and
working
well
all
good
reality
and
little
to
fear
from
brede
about
the
telegraph
line
seeing
he
to
brede
now
ay
things
are
looking
well
looking
grand
with
axel
now
chapter
xi
and
time
goes
on
winter
is
passed
spring
comes
again
isak
has
to
go
down
to
the
village
one
day
and
why
not
what
for
nay
i
do
know
says
he
but
he
gets
the
cart
cleaned
up
all
fine
puts
in
the
seat
and
drives
off
and
a
deal
of
victuals
and
such
put
in
too
and
why
not
was
for
eleseus
at
storborg
never
a
horse
went
out
from
sellanraa
but
there
was
something
taken
down
to
eleseus
when
isak
came
driving
down
over
the
moors
was
no
little
event
for
he
came
but
rarely
sivert
going
most
ways
in
his
stead
at
the
two
farms
nearest
down
folk
stand
at
the
door
of
the
huts
and
tell
one
another
is
isak
himself
and
what
he
be
going
down
after
today
and
coming
down
as
far
as
to
maaneland
there
barbro
at
the
glass
window
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
sees
him
and
says
is
isak
himself
he
comes
to
storborg
and
pulls
up
is
eleseus
at
home
eleseus
comes
out
ay
he
at
home
not
gone
yet
but
just
going
off
on
his
spring
tour
of
the
towns
down
south
here
some
things
your
mother
sent
down
says
his
father
know
what
it
is
but
nothing
much
i
doubt
eleseus
takes
the
things
and
thanks
him
and
asks
there
was
a
letter
i
suppose
or
anything
that
sort
ay
says
his
father
feeling
in
pockets
there
was
is
from
little
rebecca
i
think
they
said
eleseus
takes
the
letter
is
that
he
has
been
waiting
for
feels
it
all
nice
and
thick
and
says
to
his
father
well
was
lucky
you
came
in
time
though
is
two
days
before
off
yet
if
you
like
to
stay
a
bit
you
might
take
my
trunk
down
isak
gets
down
and
ties
up
his
horse
and
goes
for
a
stroll
over
the
ground
little
andresen
is
no
bad
worker
on
the
land
in
service
true
he
has
had
sivert
from
sellanraa
with
horses
but
he
has
done
a
deal
of
work
on
his
own
account
draining
bogs
and
hiring
a
man
himself
to
set
the
ditches
with
stone
no
need
of
buying
fodder
at
storborg
that
year
and
next
like
as
not
eleseus
would
be
keeping
a
horse
of
his
own
thanks
to
andresen
and
the
way
he
worked
on
the
land
after
a
bit
of
a
while
eleseus
calls
down
that
he
ready
with
his
trunk
ready
to
go
himself
too
by
the
look
of
it
in
a
fine
blue
suit
white
collar
galoshes
and
a
true
he
will
have
two
days
to
wait
for
the
boat
but
no
matter
he
may
just
as
well
stay
down
in
the
village
is
all
the
same
if
he
here
or
there
and
father
and
son
drive
off
andresen
watches
them
from
the
door
of
the
shop
and
wishes
a
pleasant
journey
isak
is
all
thought
for
his
boy
and
would
give
him
the
seat
to
himself
but
eleseus
will
have
none
of
that
and
up
by
his
side
they
come
to
breidablik
and
suddenly
eleseus
has
forgotten
something
what
is
it
asks
his
father
oh
his
umbrella
eleseus
has
forgotten
his
umbrella
but
he
explain
all
about
it
and
only
says
never
mind
drive
on
do
you
want
to
turn
back
no
drive
on
but
a
nuisance
it
was
how
on
earth
had
he
come
to
leave
it
was
all
in
a
hurry
through
his
father
being
there
waiting
well
now
he
had
better
buy
a
new
umbrella
at
trondhjem
when
he
got
there
was
no
importance
either
way
if
he
had
one
umbrella
or
two
but
for
all
that
eleseus
is
out
of
humour
with
himself
so
much
so
that
he
jumps
down
and
walks
behind
they
could
hardly
talk
much
on
the
way
down
after
that
seeing
isak
had
to
turn
round
every
time
and
speak
over
his
shoulder
says
isak
how
long
you
going
to
be
away
and
eleseus
answers
oh
say
three
weeks
perhaps
or
a
month
at
the
outside
his
father
marvels
how
folk
do
get
lost
in
the
big
towns
and
never
find
their
way
back
but
eleseus
answers
as
to
that
he
used
to
living
in
towns
and
never
got
lost
never
had
done
in
his
life
isak
thinks
it
a
shame
to
be
sitting
up
there
all
alone
and
calls
out
here
you
come
and
drive
a
bit
i
getting
tired
eleseus
wo
hear
of
his
father
getting
down
and
gets
up
beside
him
again
but
first
they
must
have
something
to
eat
out
of
pack
then
they
drive
on
again
they
come
to
the
two
holdings
farthest
down
easy
to
see
they
are
nearing
the
village
now
both
the
houses
have
white
curtains
in
the
little
window
facing
toward
the
road
and
a
stuck
up
on
top
of
the
hayloft
for
constitution
day
is
isak
himself
said
folk
on
the
two
new
farms
as
the
cart
went
by
at
last
eleseus
gives
over
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
and
his
own
precious
self
enough
to
ask
what
you
driving
down
for
today
h
says
his
father
was
nothing
much
today
but
then
after
all
eleseus
was
going
away
no
harm
perhaps
in
telling
him
is
blacksmith
girl
jensine
i
going
down
for
says
his
father
ay
he
admits
so
much
and
you
going
down
yourself
for
that
could
sivert
have
gone
says
eleseus
ay
eleseus
knew
no
better
nothing
better
than
to
think
sivert
would
go
down
to
the
smith
to
fetch
jensine
after
she
had
thought
so
much
of
herself
as
to
leave
sellanraa
no
was
all
awry
with
the
haymaking
the
year
before
inger
had
put
in
all
she
could
as
she
had
promised
leopoldine
did
her
share
too
not
to
speak
of
having
a
machine
for
a
horse
to
rake
but
the
hay
was
much
of
it
heavy
stuff
and
the
fields
were
big
sellanraa
was
a
sizeable
place
now
and
the
women
had
other
things
to
look
to
besides
making
hay
all
the
cattle
to
look
to
and
meals
to
be
got
and
all
in
proper
time
butter
and
cheese
to
make
and
clothes
to
wash
and
baking
of
bread
mother
and
daughter
working
all
they
could
isak
was
not
going
to
have
another
summer
like
that
he
decided
without
any
fuss
that
jensine
should
come
back
again
if
she
could
be
got
inger
too
had
no
longer
a
word
against
it
she
had
come
to
her
senses
again
and
said
ay
do
as
you
think
best
ay
inger
was
grown
reasonable
now
is
no
little
thing
to
come
to
one
senses
again
after
a
spell
inger
was
no
longer
full
of
heat
that
must
out
no
longer
full
of
wild
blood
to
be
kept
in
check
the
winter
had
cooled
her
nothing
beyond
the
needful
warmth
in
her
now
she
was
getting
stouter
growing
fine
and
stately
a
wonderful
woman
to
keep
from
fading
keep
from
dying
off
by
degrees
like
enough
because
she
had
bloomed
so
late
in
life
who
can
say
how
things
come
about
nothing
comes
from
a
single
cause
but
from
many
was
inger
not
in
the
best
repute
with
the
smith
wife
what
could
any
smith
wife
say
against
her
with
her
disfigurement
she
had
been
cheated
of
her
spring
and
later
had
been
set
in
artificial
air
to
lose
six
years
of
her
summer
with
life
still
in
her
what
wonder
her
autumn
gave
an
errant
growth
inger
was
better
than
blacksmiths
wives
a
little
damaged
a
little
warped
but
good
by
nature
clever
by
nature
ay
father
and
son
drive
down
they
come
to
brede
olsen
and
set
the
horse
in
a
shed
it
is
evening
now
they
go
in
themselves
brede
olsen
has
rented
the
house
an
outbuilding
it
had
been
belonging
to
the
storekeeper
but
done
up
now
with
two
and
two
bedrooms
none
so
bad
and
in
a
good
situation
the
place
is
well
frequented
by
and
folk
from
round
about
the
village
going
by
the
boat
brede
seems
to
have
been
in
luck
for
once
found
something
suited
to
him
and
he
may
thank
his
wife
for
that
was
brede
wife
had
hit
on
the
idea
of
a
and
the
day
she
sat
selling
coffee
at
the
auction
at
breidablik
was
a
pleasant
enough
thing
to
be
selling
something
to
feel
money
in
her
fingers
ready
cash
since
they
had
come
down
here
they
had
managed
nicely
selling
coffee
in
earnest
now
and
housing
a
deal
of
folk
with
nowhere
else
to
lay
their
heads
a
blessing
to
travellers
is
brede
wife
she
has
a
good
helper
of
course
in
katrine
her
daughter
a
big
girl
now
and
clever
at
waiting
though
that
is
only
for
the
time
of
course
not
long
before
little
katrine
must
have
something
better
than
waiting
on
folk
in
her
parents
house
but
for
the
present
they
are
making
money
fairly
well
and
that
is
the
main
thing
the
start
had
been
decidedly
favourable
and
might
have
been
better
if
the
storekeeper
had
not
run
short
of
cakes
and
sweet
biscuits
to
serve
with
the
coffee
here
were
all
the
folk
calling
for
cakes
with
their
coffee
biscuits
and
cakes
was
a
lesson
to
the
storekeeper
to
lay
in
a
good
supply
another
time
the
family
and
brede
himself
live
as
best
they
can
on
their
takings
a
good
many
meals
are
nothing
but
coffee
and
stale
cakes
left
over
but
it
keeps
them
alive
and
gives
the
children
a
delicate
sort
of
refined
appearance
is
not
every
one
has
cakes
with
their
coffee
say
the
village
folk
ay
bredes
are
doing
well
it
seems
they
even
manage
to
keep
a
dog
that
goes
round
begging
among
the
customers
and
gets
bits
here
and
there
and
grows
fat
on
it
a
good
fat
dog
about
the
place
is
a
mighty
fine
advertisement
for
a
it
speaks
for
good
feeding
anywhere
brede
then
is
husband
and
father
in
the
house
and
apart
from
that
position
has
got
on
variously
beside
he
had
been
once
more
installed
as
lensmand
assistant
and
deputy
and
had
a
good
deal
to
do
that
way
for
a
time
unfortunately
his
daughter
barbro
had
fallen
out
with
the
lensmand
wife
last
autumn
about
a
trifling
matter
a
mere
nothing
indeed
to
tell
the
truth
a
flea
and
brede
himself
is
somewhat
in
disfavour
there
since
but
brede
counts
it
no
great
loss
after
all
there
are
other
families
that
find
work
for
him
now
on
purpose
to
annoy
the
lensmand
he
is
frequently
called
upon
for
instance
to
drive
for
the
doctor
and
as
for
the
parsonage
gladly
send
for
brede
every
time
there
a
pig
to
be
killed
and
more
brede
says
so
himself
but
for
all
that
there
are
hard
times
now
and
again
in
brede
house
not
all
the
family
are
as
fat
and
flourishing
as
the
dog
still
heaven
be
praised
brede
is
not
a
man
to
take
things
much
to
heart
here
the
children
growing
up
day
by
day
says
he
though
for
that
matter
there
always
new
little
ones
coming
to
take
their
place
the
ones
that
are
grown
up
and
out
in
the
world
can
keep
themselves
and
send
home
a
bit
now
and
again
there
barbro
married
at
maaneland
and
helge
out
at
the
herring
fishery
they
send
home
something
in
money
or
money
worth
as
often
as
they
can
ay
even
katrine
doing
waiting
at
home
managed
strangely
enough
to
slip
a
note
into
her
father
hand
last
winter
when
things
were
looking
extra
bad
there
a
girl
for
you
said
brede
and
never
asked
her
where
she
got
the
money
or
what
for
ay
that
was
the
way
children
with
a
heart
to
think
of
their
parents
and
help
them
in
time
of
need
brede
is
not
altogether
pleased
with
his
boy
helge
in
that
respect
he
can
be
heard
at
times
standing
in
the
store
with
a
little
group
about
him
developing
his
theories
as
to
children
and
their
duty
toward
their
parents
look
you
now
my
boy
helge
if
he
smokes
tobacco
a
bit
or
takes
a
dram
now
and
then
i
nothing
against
that
all
been
young
in
our
time
but
is
not
right
of
him
to
go
sending
one
letter
home
after
another
and
nothing
but
words
and
wishes
in
is
not
right
to
set
his
mother
crying
is
the
wrong
road
for
a
lad
in
days
gone
by
things
were
different
children
were
no
sooner
grown
than
they
went
into
service
and
started
sending
home
a
little
to
help
and
quite
right
too
is
it
their
father
and
mother
had
borne
them
under
their
breast
first
of
all
and
sweating
blood
to
keep
the
life
in
them
all
their
tender
years
and
then
to
forget
it
all
it
almost
seemed
as
if
helge
had
heard
that
speech
of
his
father
for
there
came
a
letter
from
him
after
with
money
in
fifty
no
less
and
then
bredes
had
a
great
time
ay
in
their
endless
extravagance
they
bought
both
meat
and
fish
for
dinner
and
a
lamp
all
hung
about
with
lustres
to
hang
from
the
ceiling
in
the
best
room
they
managed
somehow
and
what
more
could
they
ask
bredes
they
kept
alive
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
but
without
great
fear
what
more
could
they
wish
for
here
visitors
indeed
says
brede
showing
isak
and
eleseus
into
the
room
with
the
new
lamp
and
i
never
thought
to
see
isak
you
never
going
away
yourself
and
all
nay
only
to
the
smith
for
something
is
no
more
ho
is
eleseus
then
going
off
south
again
eleseus
is
used
to
hotels
he
makes
himself
at
hojne
hangs
up
his
coat
and
stick
on
the
wall
and
calls
for
coffee
as
for
something
to
eat
his
father
has
things
in
a
basket
katrine
brings
the
coffee
pay
i
not
hear
of
it
says
brede
i
had
many
a
bite
and
sup
at
sellanraa
and
as
for
eleseus
i
in
his
books
already
do
take
it
katrine
but
eleseus
pays
all
the
same
takes
out
his
purse
and
pays
out
the
money
and
twenty
over
no
nonsense
about
him
isak
goes
across
to
the
smith
and
eleseus
stays
where
he
is
he
says
a
few
words
as
in
duty
bound
to
katrine
but
no
more
than
is
needed
he
would
rather
talk
to
her
father
no
eleseus
cares
nothing
for
women
has
been
frightened
off
by
them
once
as
it
were
and
takes
no
interest
in
them
now
like
as
not
he
never
much
inclination
that
way
to
speak
of
seeing
he
so
completely
out
of
it
all
now
a
strange
man
to
live
in
the
wilds
a
gentleman
with
thin
hands
and
the
sense
of
a
woman
for
finery
for
sticks
and
umbrellas
and
galoshes
frightened
off
and
changed
incomprehensibly
not
a
marrying
man
even
his
upper
lip
declines
to
put
forth
any
brutal
degree
of
growth
yet
it
might
be
the
lad
had
started
well
enough
come
of
good
stock
but
been
turned
thereafter
into
an
artificial
atmosphere
and
warped
transformed
had
he
worked
so
hard
in
an
office
in
a
shop
that
his
whole
originality
was
lost
thereby
ay
maybe
was
so
anyway
here
he
is
now
easy
and
passionless
a
little
weak
a
little
heedless
wandering
farther
and
farther
off
the
road
he
might
envy
every
soul
among
his
fellows
in
the
wilds
but
has
not
even
strength
for
that
katrine
is
used
to
jesting
with
her
customers
and
asks
him
teasingly
if
he
is
off
to
see
his
sweetheart
in
the
south
again
i
other
things
to
think
of
says
eleseus
i
out
on
business
opening
up
connections
no
call
to
be
so
free
with
your
betters
katrine
says
her
father
reprovingly
oh
brede
olsen
is
all
respect
towards
eleseus
mighty
respectful
for
him
to
be
and
well
he
may
is
but
wise
of
him
seeing
he
owes
money
up
at
storborg
and
here
his
creditor
before
him
and
eleseus
ho
all
this
deference
pleases
him
and
he
is
kind
and
gracious
in
return
calls
brede
my
dear
sir
in
jest
and
goes
on
that
way
he
mentions
that
he
has
forgotten
his
umbrella
just
as
we
were
passing
breidablik
i
thought
of
it
left
my
umbrella
behind
brede
asks
you
be
going
over
to
our
little
store
this
evening
belike
for
a
drink
says
eleseus
ay
maybe
if
was
only
myself
but
i
my
father
here
brede
makes
himself
pleasant
and
goes
on
gossiping
there
a
fellow
coming
in
day
after
tomorrow
that
on
his
way
to
america
been
home
mean
ay
he
from
up
in
the
village
a
bit
been
away
for
ever
so
many
years
and
home
for
the
winter
his
trunk
come
down
already
by
cart
and
a
mighty
fine
trunk
i
thought
of
going
to
america
myself
once
or
twice
says
eleseus
frankly
you
cries
brede
why
there
little
need
for
the
likes
of
you
going
that
way
surely
well
was
not
going
over
to
stay
for
ever
i
was
thinking
but
been
travelling
about
so
many
places
now
i
might
just
as
well
make
the
trip
over
there
ay
of
course
and
why
not
and
a
heap
of
money
and
means
and
all
so
they
say
in
america
here
this
fellow
i
spoke
of
before
he
paid
for
more
feasting
and
parties
than
easy
to
count
this
winter
past
and
comes
in
here
and
says
to
me
have
some
coffee
a
potful
and
all
the
cakes
you
got
like
to
see
his
trunk
they
went
out
in
the
passage
to
look
at
the
trunk
a
wonder
to
look
at
on
earth
flaming
all
sides
and
corners
with
metal
and
clasps
and
binding
and
three
flaps
to
hold
it
down
not
to
speak
of
a
lock
says
brede
as
if
he
had
tried
it
himself
they
went
back
into
the
room
but
eleseus
was
grown
thoughtful
this
american
from
up
in
the
village
had
outdone
him
he
was
nothing
beside
such
a
man
going
out
on
journeys
like
any
high
official
ay
natural
enough
that
brede
should
make
a
fuss
of
him
eleseus
ordered
more
coffee
and
tried
to
play
the
rich
man
too
ordered
cakes
with
his
coffee
and
gave
them
to
the
dog
and
all
the
time
feeling
worthless
and
dejected
what
was
his
trunk
beside
that
wonder
out
there
there
it
stood
black
canvas
with
the
corners
all
rubbed
and
worn
a
handbag
nothing
more
ho
but
wait
he
would
buy
a
trunk
when
he
got
to
the
towns
a
splendid
one
it
should
be
only
wait
is
a
pity
to
feed
the
dog
so
says
brede
and
eleseus
feels
better
at
that
and
ready
to
show
off
again
is
a
marvel
how
a
beast
can
get
so
fat
says
he
one
thought
leading
to
another
eleseus
breaks
off
his
talk
with
brede
and
goes
out
into
the
shed
to
look
at
the
horse
and
there
he
takes
out
a
letter
from
his
pocket
and
opens
it
he
had
put
it
away
at
once
never
troubling
to
look
what
money
was
in
it
he
had
had
letters
of
that
sort
from
home
before
and
always
a
deal
of
notes
inside
something
to
help
him
on
the
way
what
was
this
a
big
sheet
of
grey
paper
scrawled
all
over
little
rebecca
to
her
brother
eleseus
and
a
few
words
from
his
mother
what
else
nothing
else
no
money
at
all
his
mother
wrote
that
she
could
not
ask
his
father
for
more
money
again
now
for
there
was
none
too
much
left
of
all
they
had
got
for
the
copper
mine
that
time
the
money
had
gone
to
buy
storborg
and
pay
for
all
the
goods
after
and
eleseus
travelling
about
he
must
try
and
manage
by
himself
this
time
for
the
money
that
was
left
would
have
to
be
kept
for
his
brother
and
sisters
not
to
leave
them
all
without
and
a
pleasant
journey
and
your
loving
mother
no
money
eleseus
himself
had
not
enough
for
his
fare
he
had
cleaned
out
the
cash
box
at
storborg
and
that
was
not
much
oh
but
he
had
been
a
fool
to
send
that
money
to
the
dealers
in
bergen
on
account
no
hurry
for
that
he
might
have
let
it
stand
over
he
ought
of
course
to
have
opened
the
letter
before
starting
out
at
all
he
might
have
saved
himself
that
journey
down
to
the
village
with
his
miserable
trunk
and
all
and
here
he
was
his
father
comes
back
from
the
smith
after
settling
his
business
there
jensine
was
to
go
back
with
him
next
morning
and
jensine
look
you
had
been
nowise
contrary
and
hard
to
persuade
but
saw
at
once
they
wanted
help
at
sellanraa
for
the
summer
and
was
ready
to
come
a
proper
way
to
do
again
while
his
father
is
talking
eleseus
sits
thinking
of
his
own
affairs
he
shows
him
the
american
trunk
and
says
only
wish
i
was
where
that
come
from
and
his
father
answers
ay
was
none
so
bad
maybe
next
morning
isak
gets
ready
to
start
for
home
again
has
his
food
puts
in
the
horse
and
drives
round
by
the
smith
to
fetch
jensine
and
her
box
eleseus
stands
looking
after
them
as
they
go
then
when
they
are
lost
to
sight
in
the
woods
he
pays
his
score
at
the
again
and
something
over
you
can
leave
my
trunk
here
till
i
come
back
he
tells
katrine
and
off
he
goes
eleseus
going
where
only
one
place
to
go
he
turns
back
going
back
home
again
so
he
too
takes
the
road
up
over
the
hills
again
taking
care
to
keep
as
near
his
father
and
jensine
as
he
can
without
being
seen
walks
on
and
on
beginning
now
to
envy
every
soul
of
them
in
the
wilds
is
a
pity
about
eleseus
so
changed
he
is
and
all
is
he
doing
no
business
at
storborg
such
as
it
is
nothing
to
make
a
fortune
out
of
there
and
eleseus
is
overmuch
out
and
abroad
making
pleasant
journeys
on
business
to
open
up
connections
and
it
costs
too
much
he
does
not
travel
cheaply
does
do
to
be
mean
says
eleseus
and
gives
twenty
over
where
he
might
save
ten
the
business
can
not
support
a
man
of
his
tastes
he
must
get
subsidies
from
home
there
the
farm
at
storborg
with
potatoes
and
corn
and
hay
enough
for
the
place
itself
but
all
provisions
else
must
come
from
sellanraa
is
that
all
sivert
must
cart
up
his
brother
goods
from
the
steamer
all
for
nothing
and
is
that
all
his
mother
must
get
money
out
of
his
father
to
pay
for
his
journeys
but
is
that
all
the
worst
is
to
come
eleseus
manages
his
business
like
a
fool
it
flatters
him
to
have
folk
coming
up
from
the
village
to
buy
at
storborg
so
that
he
gives
them
credit
as
soon
as
asked
and
when
this
is
noised
abroad
there
come
still
more
of
them
to
buy
the
same
way
the
whole
thing
is
going
to
rack
and
ruin
eleseus
is
an
easy
man
and
lets
it
go
the
store
is
emptied
and
the
store
is
filled
again
all
costs
money
and
who
pays
it
his
father
at
first
his
mother
had
been
a
faithful
spokesman
for
him
every
way
eleseus
was
the
clever
head
of
the
family
they
must
help
him
on
and
give
him
a
start
then
think
how
cheaply
he
had
got
storborg
and
saying
straight
out
what
he
would
give
for
it
when
his
father
thought
it
was
going
wrong
somehow
with
the
business
and
naught
but
foolery
she
took
him
up
how
can
you
stand
there
and
say
such
things
ay
she
reproved
him
for
using
such
words
about
his
son
isak
was
forgetting
his
place
it
seemed
to
speak
so
of
eleseus
for
look
you
his
mother
had
been
out
in
the
world
herself
she
understood
how
hard
it
was
for
eleseus
to
live
in
the
wilds
being
used
to
better
things
and
accustomed
to
move
in
society
and
with
none
of
his
equals
near
he
risked
too
much
in
his
dealings
with
folk
that
were
none
of
the
soundest
but
even
so
was
not
done
with
any
evil
intent
on
his
part
of
ruining
his
parents
but
sheer
goodness
of
heart
and
noble
nature
was
his
way
to
help
those
that
were
not
so
fine
and
grand
as
himself
why
was
he
the
only
man
in
those
parts
to
use
white
handkerchiefs
that
were
always
having
to
be
washed
when
folk
came
trustingly
to
him
and
asked
for
credit
if
he
were
to
say
no
they
might
take
it
amiss
it
might
seem
as
if
he
were
not
the
noble
fellow
they
had
thought
after
all
also
he
had
a
certain
duty
towards
his
fellows
as
the
man
the
genius
among
them
all
ay
his
mother
bore
all
these
things
in
mind
but
his
father
never
understanding
it
all
in
the
least
opened
her
eyes
and
ears
one
day
and
said
look
you
here
here
all
that
is
left
of
the
money
from
that
mine
that
all
said
she
and
what
come
of
the
rest
eleseus
he
had
the
rest
and
she
clasped
her
hands
at
that
and
declared
it
was
time
eleseus
began
to
use
his
wits
poor
eleseus
all
set
on
end
and
frittered
away
better
maybe
if
he
worked
on
the
land
all
the
time
but
now
he
a
man
that
has
learned
to
write
and
use
letters
no
grip
in
him
no
depth
for
all
that
no
devil
of
a
man
not
in
love
not
ambitious
hardly
nothing
at
all
is
eleseus
not
even
a
bad
thing
of
any
great
dimensions
something
unfortunate
about
this
young
man
as
if
something
were
rotting
him
from
within
that
engineer
from
the
town
good
man
better
perhaps
if
he
had
not
discovered
the
lad
in
his
youth
and
taken
him
up
to
make
something
out
of
him
the
child
had
lost
his
roothold
and
suffered
thereby
all
that
he
turns
to
now
leads
back
to
something
wanting
in
him
something
dark
against
the
light
eleseus
goes
on
and
on
the
two
in
the
cart
ahead
pass
by
storborg
eleseus
goes
a
long
way
round
and
he
too
passes
by
what
was
he
to
do
there
at
home
at
his
trading
station
and
store
the
two
in
the
cart
get
to
sellanraa
at
nightfall
eleseus
is
close
at
their
heels
sees
sivert
come
out
in
the
yard
all
surprised
to
see
jensine
and
the
two
shake
hands
and
laugh
a
little
then
sivert
takes
the
horse
out
and
leads
it
to
stable
eleseus
ventures
forward
the
pride
of
the
family
he
ventures
up
a
little
not
walking
up
but
stealing
up
he
comes
on
sivert
in
the
stable
is
only
me
he
says
what
you
too
says
sivert
all
astonished
again
the
two
brothers
begin
talking
quietly
about
sivert
getting
his
mother
to
find
some
money
a
last
resource
the
money
for
a
journey
things
ca
go
on
this
way
eleseus
is
weary
of
it
has
been
thinking
of
it
a
long
time
now
and
he
must
go
tonight
a
long
journey
to
america
and
start
tonight
america
says
sivert
out
loud
sh
i
been
thinking
of
it
a
long
time
and
you
must
get
her
to
do
as
i
say
it
ca
go
on
like
this
and
i
been
thinking
of
going
for
ever
so
long
but
america
says
sivert
no
do
you
do
it
i
going
i
settled
that
going
back
now
to
catch
the
boat
but
you
must
have
something
to
eat
i
not
hungry
but
rest
a
bit
then
no
sivert
is
trying
to
act
for
the
best
and
hold
his
brother
back
but
eleseus
is
determined
ay
for
once
he
is
determined
sivert
himself
is
all
taken
aback
first
of
all
it
was
a
surprise
to
see
jensine
again
and
now
here
eleseus
going
to
leave
the
place
altogether
not
to
say
the
world
what
about
storborg
says
he
what
you
do
with
it
andresen
can
have
it
says
sivert
andresen
have
it
how
mean
is
he
going
to
have
leopoldine
do
know
about
that
ay
perhaps
he
is
they
talk
quietly
keep
on
talking
sivert
thinks
it
would
be
best
if
his
father
came
out
and
eleseus
could
talk
to
him
himself
but
no
no
whispers
eleseus
again
he
was
never
much
of
a
man
to
face
a
thing
like
that
but
always
must
have
a
says
sivert
well
mother
you
know
how
is
with
her
there
be
no
getting
any
way
with
her
for
crying
and
talking
on
she
must
know
no
eleseus
agrees
she
must
know
sivert
goes
off
stays
away
for
ages
and
comes
back
with
money
a
heap
of
money
here
that
all
he
has
think
it
be
enough
count
he
did
count
how
much
there
was
what
did
he
say
father
nay
he
did
say
much
now
you
must
wait
a
little
and
i
get
some
more
clothes
on
and
go
down
with
you
is
not
worth
while
you
go
and
lie
down
ho
are
you
frightened
of
the
dark
that
i
must
go
away
says
sivert
trying
a
moment
to
be
cheerful
he
is
away
a
moment
and
comes
back
dressed
and
with
his
food
basket
over
his
shoulder
as
they
go
out
there
is
their
father
standing
outside
so
you
going
all
that
way
seems
says
isak
ay
answered
eleseus
but
i
be
coming
back
again
i
not
be
keeping
you
now
there
little
time
mumbles
the
old
man
and
turns
away
good
luck
he
croaks
out
in
a
strange
voice
and
goes
off
all
hurriedly
the
two
brothers
walk
down
the
road
a
little
way
gone
they
sit
down
to
eat
eleseus
is
hungry
can
hardly
eat
enough
is
a
fine
spring
night
and
the
black
grouse
at
play
on
the
hilltops
the
homely
sound
makes
the
emigrant
lose
courage
for
a
moment
is
a
fine
night
says
he
you
better
turn
back
now
sivert
says
he
h
says
sivert
and
goes
on
with
him
they
pass
by
storborg
by
breidablik
and
the
sound
follows
them
all
the
way
from
the
hills
here
and
there
is
no
military
music
like
in
the
towns
nay
but
voices
a
proclamation
spring
has
come
then
suddenly
the
first
chirp
of
a
bird
is
heard
from
a
treetop
waking
others
and
a
calling
and
answering
on
every
side
more
than
a
song
it
is
a
hymn
of
praise
the
emigrant
feels
already
maybe
something
weak
and
helpless
in
him
he
is
going
off
to
america
and
none
could
be
more
fitted
to
go
than
he
you
turn
back
now
sivert
says
he
ay
well
says
his
brother
if
you
rather
they
sit
down
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
see
the
village
just
below
them
the
store
and
the
quay
brede
old
some
men
are
moving
about
by
the
steamer
getting
ready
well
no
time
to
stay
sitting
here
says
eleseus
getting
up
again
fancy
you
going
all
that
way
says
sivert
and
eleseus
answers
but
i
be
coming
back
again
and
i
have
a
better
sort
of
trunk
that
journey
as
they
say
sivert
thrusts
something
into
his
hand
a
bit
of
something
wrapped
in
paper
what
is
it
asks
eleseus
do
forget
to
write
often
says
sivert
and
so
he
goes
eleseus
opens
the
paper
and
looks
is
the
gold
piece
in
gold
here
do
he
calls
out
you
must
do
that
sivert
walks
on
walks
on
a
little
then
turns
round
and
sits
down
again
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
more
folk
astir
now
down
by
the
steamer
passengers
going
on
board
eleseus
going
on
board
the
boat
pushes
off
from
the
side
and
rows
away
and
eleseus
is
gone
to
america
he
never
came
back
chapter
xii
a
notable
procession
coming
up
to
sellanraa
something
laughable
to
look
at
maybe
but
more
than
that
three
men
with
enormous
burdens
with
sacks
hanging
down
from
their
shoulders
front
and
back
walking
one
behind
the
other
and
calling
to
one
another
with
jesting
words
but
heavily
laden
little
andresen
chief
clerk
is
head
of
that
procession
indeed
is
his
procession
he
has
fitted
out
himself
and
sivert
from
sellanraa
and
one
other
fredrik
str√∂m
from
breidablik
for
the
expedition
a
notable
little
man
is
andresen
his
shoulder
is
weighed
down
slantwise
on
one
side
and
his
jacket
pulled
all
awry
at
the
neck
the
way
he
goes
but
he
carries
his
burden
on
and
on
storborg
and
the
business
eleseus
had
left
well
not
bought
it
straight
out
on
the
spot
perhaps
is
more
than
andresen
could
afford
better
afford
to
wait
a
bit
and
get
the
whole
maybe
for
nothing
andresen
is
no
fool
he
has
taken
over
the
place
on
lease
for
the
meanwhile
and
manages
the
business
himself
gone
through
the
stock
in
hand
and
found
a
deal
of
unsalable
truck
in
eleseus
store
even
to
such
things
as
toothbrushes
and
embroidered
table
centres
ay
and
stuffed
birds
on
springs
that
squeaked
when
you
pressed
in
the
right
place
these
are
the
things
he
has
started
out
with
now
going
to
sell
them
to
the
miners
on
the
other
side
of
the
hills
he
knows
from
time
that
miners
with
money
in
their
pockets
will
buy
anything
on
earth
only
a
pity
he
had
to
leave
behind
six
that
eleseus
had
ordered
on
his
last
trip
to
bergen
the
caravan
turns
into
the
yard
at
sellanraa
and
sets
down
its
load
no
long
wait
here
they
drink
a
mug
of
milk
and
make
pretence
of
trying
to
sell
their
wares
on
the
spot
then
shoulder
their
burdens
and
off
again
they
are
not
out
for
pretence
off
they
go
trundling
southward
through
the
forest
they
march
till
noon
rest
for
a
meal
and
on
again
till
evening
then
they
camp
and
make
a
fire
lie
down
and
sleep
a
while
sivert
sleeps
resting
on
a
boulder
that
he
calls
an
oh
sivert
knows
what
he
is
about
here
the
sun
been
warming
that
boulder
all
day
till
it
a
good
place
to
sit
and
sleep
his
companions
are
not
so
wise
and
will
not
take
advice
they
lie
down
in
the
heather
and
wake
up
feeling
cold
and
sneezing
then
they
have
breakfast
and
start
off
again
listening
now
for
any
sound
of
blasting
about
they
are
hoping
to
come
on
the
mine
and
meet
with
folk
some
time
that
day
the
work
should
have
got
so
far
by
now
a
good
way
up
from
the
water
towards
sellanraa
but
never
a
sound
of
blasting
anywhere
they
march
till
noon
meeting
never
a
soul
but
here
and
there
they
come
upon
holes
in
the
ground
where
men
have
been
digging
for
trial
what
can
this
mean
means
no
doubt
that
the
ore
must
be
more
than
commonly
rich
at
the
farther
end
of
the
tract
they
are
getting
out
pure
heavy
copper
and
keeping
to
that
end
all
the
time
in
the
afternoon
they
come
upon
several
more
mines
but
no
miners
they
march
on
till
evening
and
already
they
can
make
out
the
sea
below
marching
through
a
wilderness
of
deserted
mines
and
never
a
sound
is
all
beyond
understanding
but
nothing
for
it
they
must
camp
and
sleep
out
again
that
night
they
talk
the
matter
over
can
the
work
have
stopped
should
they
turn
and
go
back
again
not
a
bit
of
it
says
andresen
next
morning
a
man
walks
into
their
camp
a
pale
haggard
man
who
looks
at
them
frowningly
piercingly
that
you
andresen
says
the
man
it
is
aronsen
aronsen
the
trader
he
does
not
say
no
to
a
cup
of
hot
coffee
and
something
to
eat
with
the
caravan
and
settles
down
at
once
i
saw
the
smoke
of
your
fire
and
came
up
to
see
what
it
was
says
he
i
said
to
myself
enough
they
coming
to
their
senses
and
starting
work
again
and
was
only
you
after
all
where
you
making
for
then
here
what
that
you
got
with
you
goods
goods
cries
aronsen
coming
up
here
with
goods
for
sale
who
to
buy
them
there
never
a
soul
they
left
last
saturday
gone
left
who
left
all
the
lot
not
a
soul
on
the
place
now
and
i
goods
enough
myself
anyway
a
whole
store
packed
full
i
sell
you
anything
you
like
oh
trader
aronsen
in
difficulties
again
the
mine
has
shut
down
they
ply
him
with
coffee
till
he
grows
calmer
and
asks
what
it
all
means
aronsen
shakes
his
head
despairingly
is
beyond
understanding
there
no
words
for
it
says
he
all
had
been
going
so
well
and
he
had
been
selling
goods
and
money
pouring
in
the
village
round
all
flourishing
and
using
the
finest
meal
and
a
new
schoolhouse
and
hanging
lamps
and
boots
and
all
then
suddenly
their
lordships
up
at
the
mine
take
it
into
their
heads
that
the
thing
paying
and
close
down
not
paying
but
it
paid
them
before
there
clean
copper
there
and
plain
to
see
at
every
blasting
was
rank
cheating
no
less
and
never
a
thought
of
what
it
means
to
a
man
like
me
ay
i
doubt
it
as
they
say
is
that
geissler
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
same
as
before
no
sooner
he
come
up
than
the
work
stopped
was
as
if
he
smelt
it
out
somehow
geissler
is
he
here
then
is
he
not
ought
to
be
shot
he
ought
comes
up
one
day
by
the
steamer
and
says
to
the
engineer
how
things
going
right
as
far
as
i
can
see
says
the
engineer
but
geissler
he
just
stands
there
and
asks
again
all
right
is
it
as
far
as
i
know
says
the
engineer
but
as
true
as
i
here
no
sooner
the
post
comes
up
from
that
same
boat
geissler
had
come
by
than
letter
and
telegram
both
to
the
engineer
that
the
work
was
paying
and
he
to
shut
down
at
once
the
members
of
the
expedition
look
at
one
another
but
the
leader
andresen
himself
has
not
lost
courage
yet
you
may
just
as
well
turn
back
and
go
home
again
is
advice
we
not
doing
that
says
andresen
and
packs
up
the
aronsen
stares
at
the
three
of
them
in
turn
you
mad
then
says
he
look
you
andresen
he
cares
little
now
for
what
his
master
that
was
can
say
he
master
himself
now
leader
of
an
expedition
equipped
at
his
own
expense
for
a
journey
to
distant
parts
lose
him
his
prestige
to
turn
back
now
where
he
is
well
where
will
you
go
asks
aronsen
irritably
ca
say
answers
andresen
but
he
a
notion
of
his
own
all
the
same
no
doubt
thinking
maybe
of
the
natives
and
coming
down
into
the
district
three
men
strong
with
glass
beads
and
finger
rings
we
be
getting
on
says
he
to
the
rest
now
aronsen
had
thought
like
enough
to
go
farther
up
that
morning
seeing
he
come
so
far
wanting
maybe
to
see
if
all
the
place
was
quite
deserted
if
it
could
be
true
every
man
on
the
place
was
gone
but
seeing
these
so
set
on
going
on
it
hinders
him
and
he
tells
them
again
and
again
they
mad
to
try
aronsen
is
furious
himself
marches
down
in
front
of
the
caravan
turning
round
and
shouting
at
them
barking
at
them
trying
to
keep
them
out
of
his
district
and
so
they
come
down
to
the
huts
in
the
mining
centre
a
little
town
of
huts
but
empty
and
desolate
most
of
the
tools
and
implements
are
housed
under
cover
but
poles
and
planks
broken
carts
and
cases
and
barrels
lie
all
about
in
disorder
here
and
there
a
notice
on
a
door
declares
no
admittance
there
you
are
cries
aronsen
what
did
i
say
not
a
soul
in
the
place
and
he
threatens
the
caravan
with
disaster
he
will
send
for
the
lensmand
anyway
he
going
to
follow
them
every
step
now
and
if
he
can
catch
them
at
any
unlawful
trading
is
penal
servitude
and
slavery
no
mistake
all
at
once
somebody
calls
out
for
sivert
the
place
is
not
altogether
dead
after
all
not
utterly
deserted
here
is
a
man
standing
beckoning
at
the
corner
of
a
house
sivert
trundles
over
with
his
load
and
sees
at
once
who
it
is
geissler
funny
meeting
you
here
says
geissler
his
face
is
red
and
flourishing
but
his
eyes
apparently
can
not
stand
the
glare
of
spring
he
is
wearing
smoked
glasses
he
talks
as
brilliantly
as
ever
luckiest
thing
in
the
world
says
he
save
me
going
all
the
way
up
to
sellanraa
and
i
a
deal
to
look
after
how
many
settlers
are
there
in
the
now
ten
ten
new
holdings
i
agree
i
satisfied
but
is
men
of
your
father
stamp
the
country
wants
ay
that
what
i
say
and
i
mean
it
i
reckoned
it
out
sivert
are
you
coming
on
the
caravan
is
waiting
geissler
hears
and
calls
back
sharply
no
i
come
on
after
calls
sivert
and
sets
down
his
load
the
two
men
sit
down
and
talk
geissler
is
in
the
right
mood
today
the
spirit
moves
him
and
he
talks
all
the
time
only
pausing
when
sivert
puts
in
a
word
or
so
in
answer
and
then
going
on
again
a
mighty
lucky
thing
ca
help
saying
it
everything
turned
out
just
as
i
wanted
all
the
way
up
and
now
meeting
you
here
and
saving
all
the
journey
to
sellanraa
all
well
at
home
what
all
well
and
thank
you
kindly
got
up
that
hayloft
yet
over
the
cowshed
ay
is
done
well
well
i
a
heap
of
things
to
look
to
almost
more
than
i
can
manage
look
at
where
we
sitting
now
for
instance
what
say
to
that
sivert
man
ruined
city
eh
men
gone
about
to
build
it
all
against
their
nature
and
properly
speaking
it
all
my
fault
from
the
start
that
is
to
say
i
a
humble
agent
in
the
workings
of
fate
it
all
began
when
your
father
picked
up
some
bits
of
stone
up
in
the
hills
and
gave
you
to
play
with
when
you
were
a
child
that
was
how
it
started
i
knew
well
enough
those
bits
of
stone
were
worth
exactly
as
much
as
men
would
give
for
them
no
more
well
and
good
i
set
a
price
on
them
myself
and
bought
them
then
the
stones
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
did
no
end
of
damage
time
went
on
and
now
a
few
days
ago
i
came
up
here
again
and
what
for
think
to
buy
those
stones
back
again
geissler
stops
for
a
moment
and
looks
at
sivert
then
suddenly
he
glances
at
the
sack
and
asks
what
that
you
carrying
goods
says
sivert
we
taking
them
down
to
the
village
geissler
does
not
seem
interested
in
the
answer
has
not
even
heard
it
like
as
not
he
goes
on
buy
them
back
again
yes
last
time
i
let
my
son
manage
the
deal
he
sold
them
then
young
fellow
about
your
own
age
that
all
about
him
he
the
lightning
in
the
family
i
more
a
sort
of
fog
know
the
right
thing
to
do
but
do
do
it
but
he
the
lightning
and
he
entered
the
service
of
industry
for
the
time
being
was
he
sold
for
me
last
time
i
something
and
he
not
he
only
the
lightning
quick
to
act
modern
type
but
the
lightning
by
itself
a
barren
thing
look
at
you
folk
at
sellanraa
now
looking
up
at
blue
peaks
every
day
of
your
lives
no
inventions
about
that
but
fjeld
and
rocky
peaks
rooted
deep
in
the
past
but
you
them
for
companionship
there
you
are
living
in
touch
with
heaven
and
earth
one
with
them
one
with
all
these
wide
things
no
need
of
a
sword
in
your
hands
you
go
through
life
bareheaded
barehanded
in
the
midst
of
a
great
kindliness
look
nature
there
for
you
and
yours
to
have
and
enjoy
man
and
nature
do
bombard
each
other
but
agree
they
do
compete
race
one
against
the
other
but
go
together
there
you
sellanraa
folk
in
all
this
living
there
fjeld
and
forest
moors
and
meadow
and
sky
and
stars
oh
is
not
poor
and
sparingly
counted
out
but
without
measure
listen
to
me
sivert
you
be
content
you
everything
to
live
on
everything
to
live
for
everything
to
believe
in
being
born
and
bringing
forth
you
are
the
needful
on
earth
is
not
all
that
are
so
but
you
are
so
needful
on
earth
is
you
that
maintain
life
generation
to
generation
breeding
ever
anew
and
when
you
die
the
new
stock
goes
on
that
the
meaning
of
eternal
life
what
do
you
get
out
of
it
an
existence
innocently
and
properly
set
towards
all
what
you
get
out
of
it
nothing
can
put
you
under
orders
and
lord
it
over
you
sellanraa
folk
you
peace
and
authority
and
this
great
kindliness
all
round
that
what
you
get
for
it
you
lie
at
a
mother
breast
and
suck
and
play
with
a
warm
hand
there
your
father
now
he
one
of
the
thousand
what
to
be
said
of
many
another
i
something
i
the
fog
as
it
were
here
and
there
floating
around
sometimes
coming
like
rain
on
dry
ground
but
the
others
there
my
son
the
lightning
that
nothing
in
itself
a
flash
of
barrenness
he
can
act
my
son
ay
he
the
modern
type
a
man
of
our
time
he
believes
honestly
enough
all
the
age
has
taught
him
all
the
jew
and
the
yankee
have
taught
him
i
shake
my
head
at
it
all
but
there
nothing
mythical
about
me
is
only
in
the
family
so
to
speak
that
i
like
a
fog
sit
there
shaking
my
head
tell
the
truth
i
not
the
power
of
doing
things
and
not
regretting
it
if
i
had
i
could
be
lightning
myself
now
i
a
fog
suddenly
geissler
seems
to
recollect
himself
and
asks
got
up
that
hayloft
yet
above
the
cowshed
ay
that
done
and
father
put
up
a
new
house
new
house
is
in
case
any
one
should
come
he
says
in
case
geissler
he
should
happen
to
come
along
geissler
thinks
over
this
and
takes
his
decision
well
then
better
come
yes
i
come
you
can
tell
your
father
that
but
i
a
heap
of
things
to
look
to
came
up
here
and
told
the
engineer
to
let
his
people
in
sweden
know
i
was
ready
to
buy
and
we
see
what
happened
all
the
same
to
me
no
hurry
you
ought
to
have
seen
that
engineer
here
he
been
going
about
and
keeping
it
all
up
with
men
and
horses
and
money
and
machines
and
any
amount
of
fuss
thought
it
was
all
right
knew
no
better
the
more
bits
of
stone
he
can
turn
into
money
the
better
he
thinks
he
doing
something
clever
and
deserving
bringing
money
to
the
place
to
the
country
and
everything
nearing
disaster
more
and
more
and
he
none
the
wiser
is
not
money
the
country
wants
there
more
than
enough
of
it
already
is
men
like
your
father
there
not
enough
of
ay
turning
the
means
to
an
end
in
itself
and
being
proud
of
it
they
mad
diseased
they
do
work
they
know
nothing
of
the
plough
only
the
dice
mighty
deserving
of
them
is
it
working
and
wasting
themselves
to
nothing
in
their
own
mad
way
look
at
them
staking
everything
are
they
there
but
this
much
wrong
with
it
all
they
forget
that
gambling
is
courage
is
not
even
foolhardy
courage
is
a
horror
know
what
gambling
is
is
fear
with
the
sweat
on
your
brow
what
it
is
what
wrong
with
them
is
they
wo
keep
pace
with
life
but
want
to
go
faster
race
on
tear
on
ahead
driving
themselves
into
life
itself
like
wedges
and
then
the
flanks
of
them
say
here
stop
there
something
breaking
find
a
remedy
stop
say
the
flanks
and
then
life
crushes
them
politely
but
firmly
crushes
them
and
then
they
set
to
complaining
about
life
raging
against
life
each
to
his
own
taste
some
may
have
ground
to
complain
others
not
but
none
should
rage
against
life
not
be
stern
and
strict
and
just
with
life
but
be
merciful
to
it
and
take
its
part
only
think
of
the
gamblers
life
has
to
bear
with
geissler
recollects
himself
again
and
says
well
all
that
as
it
may
be
leave
it
he
is
evidently
tired
beginning
to
breathe
in
little
gasps
going
down
says
he
ay
there
no
hurry
you
owe
me
a
long
walk
over
the
hills
sivert
man
remember
that
i
remember
it
all
i
remember
from
the
time
i
was
a
year
and
a
half
stood
leaning
down
from
the
barn
bridge
at
garmo
and
noticed
a
smell
i
can
smell
it
again
now
but
all
that
as
it
may
be
that
too
but
we
might
have
done
that
trip
over
the
hills
now
if
you
had
got
that
sack
what
in
it
goods
is
andresen
is
going
to
sell
them
well
then
i
a
man
that
knows
what
the
right
thing
to
do
but
does
do
it
says
geissler
i
the
fog
now
perhaps
i
buy
that
mine
back
again
one
of
these
days
it
not
impossible
but
if
i
do
it
would
be
to
go
about
staring
up
at
the
sky
and
saying
railway
south
america
no
leave
that
to
the
gamblers
folk
hereabout
say
i
must
be
the
devil
himself
because
i
knew
beforehand
this
was
going
to
break
up
but
there
nothing
mystical
about
me
simple
enough
the
new
copper
mines
in
montana
that
all
the
yankees
are
smarter
than
we
are
at
that
game
they
are
cutting
us
to
death
in
south
america
our
ore
here
too
poor
my
son
the
lightning
he
got
the
news
and
i
came
floating
up
here
simple
it
i
beat
those
fellows
in
sweden
by
a
few
hours
that
all
geissler
is
short
of
breath
again
he
gets
on
his
feet
and
says
if
you
going
down
let
get
along
they
go
on
down
together
geissler
dragging
behind
all
tired
out
the
caravan
has
stopped
at
the
quay
and
fredrik
str√∂m
cheerful
as
ever
is
poking
fun
at
aronsen
i
clean
out
of
tobacco
got
any
tobacco
what
i
give
you
tobacco
said
aronsen
threateningly
fredrik
laughs
and
says
comfortingly
nay
you
no
call
to
take
it
all
and
sad
aronsen
we
just
going
to
sell
these
things
here
before
your
eyes
and
then
we
be
off
home
again
get
away
and
wash
your
dirty
mouth
says
aronsen
furiously
ha
ha
ha
nay
you
no
call
to
dance
about
that
way
keep
still
and
look
like
a
picture
geissler
is
tired
tired
out
even
his
smoked
glasses
do
not
help
him
now
his
eyes
keep
closing
in
the
glare
sivert
man
says
he
all
at
once
no
i
ca
get
up
to
sellanraa
this
time
after
all
tell
your
father
i
a
heap
of
things
to
see
to
but
i
come
later
on
say
that
aronsen
spits
after
him
and
says
ought
to
be
shot
for
three
days
the
caravan
peddles
its
wares
selling
out
the
contents
of
the
sacks
and
getting
good
prices
it
was
a
brilliant
piece
of
business
the
village
folk
were
still
well
supplied
with
money
after
the
downfall
of
the
mine
and
were
excellently
in
form
in
the
way
of
spending
those
stuffed
birds
on
springs
were
the
very
thing
they
wanted
they
set
them
up
on
chests
of
drawers
in
their
parlours
and
also
bought
nice
the
very
thing
for
cutting
the
leaves
of
an
almanac
aronsen
was
furious
just
as
if
i
had
things
every
bit
as
good
in
my
store
said
he
trader
aronsen
was
in
a
sorry
way
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
with
these
pedlars
and
their
sacks
watching
them
all
the
time
but
they
went
separate
ways
about
the
village
each
for
himself
and
aronsen
almost
tore
himself
to
pieces
trying
to
follow
all
at
once
first
he
gave
up
fredrik
str√∂m
who
was
quickest
at
saying
unpleasant
things
then
sivert
because
he
never
said
a
word
but
went
on
selling
at
last
he
stuck
to
following
his
former
clerk
and
trying
to
set
folk
against
him
wherever
he
went
in
oh
but
andresen
knew
his
master
that
was
knew
him
of
old
and
how
little
he
knew
of
business
and
unlawful
trading
ho
you
mean
to
say
english
thread
not
prohibited
said
aronsen
looking
wise
i
know
it
is
answered
andresen
but
i
not
carrying
any
this
way
i
can
sell
that
elsewhere
i
have
a
reel
in
my
pack
look
for
yourself
if
you
like
that
as
it
may
be
says
aronsen
anyway
i
know
what
forbidden
and
i
shown
you
so
do
try
to
teach
me
aronsen
stood
it
for
a
whole
day
then
he
gave
up
andresen
too
and
went
home
the
pedlars
had
no
one
to
watch
them
after
that
and
then
things
began
to
go
swimmingly
it
was
in
the
day
when
womenfolk
used
to
wear
loose
plaits
in
their
hair
and
andresen
he
was
the
man
to
sell
loose
plaits
ay
at
a
pinch
he
could
sell
fair
plaits
to
dark
girls
and
be
sorry
he
nothing
lighter
no
grey
plaits
for
instance
for
that
was
the
finest
of
all
and
every
evening
the
three
young
salesmen
met
at
an
appointed
place
and
went
over
the
day
trade
each
borrowing
from
another
anything
he
sold
out
of
and
andresen
would
sit
down
often
as
not
and
take
out
a
file
and
file
away
the
german
from
a
sportsman
whistle
or
rub
out
faber
on
the
pens
and
pencils
andresen
was
a
trump
and
always
had
been
sivert
on
the
other

was
rather
a
disappointment
not
that
he
was
any
way
slack
and
failed
to
sell
his
goods
was
he
indeed
sold
most
but
he
did
not
get
enough
for
them
you
do
put
in
enough
patter
with
it
said
andresen
no
sivert
was
no
hand
at
reeling
off
a
lot
of
talk
he
was
a
fieldworker
sure
of
what
he
said
and
speaking
calmly
when
he
spoke
at
all
what
was
there
to
talk
about
here
also
sivert
was
anxious
to
be
done
with
it
and
get
back
home
there
was
work
to
do
in
the
fields
tis

jensine
calling

explained
fredrik
himself
by
the
way
had
work
on
his
own
fields
to
be
done
that
spring
and
little
time
to
waste
but
for
all
that
he
must
look
in
on
aronsen
the
last
day
and
get
up
an
argument
with
him
i
sell
him
the
empty
sacks
said
he
andresen
and
sivert
stayed
outside
while
he
went
in
they
heard
grand
inside
the
store
both
talking
at
once
and
fredrik
setting
up
a
laugh
now
and
again
then
aronsen
threw
open
the
door
and
showed
his
visitor
out
oh
but
fredrik
did
come
out
no
he
took
his
time
and
talked
a
lot
more
the
last
thing
they
heard
from
outside
was
fredrik
trying
to
sell
aronsen
a
lot

then
the
caravan
went
home
again
three
young
men
full
of
life
and
health
they
marched
and
sang
slept
a
few
hours
in
the
open
and
went
on
again
when
they
got
back
to

on
the

isak

begun
sowing
the

was
right
for
it
the
air
moist
with
the
sun
peeping
out
now
and
again
and
a
mighty
rainbow
strung
right
across
the
heavens
the
caravan
broke
up
isak
at
his
sowing
a
stump
of
a
man
a
barge
of
a
man
to
look
at
nothing
more
clad
in
homespun
wool
from
his
own
sheep
boots
from
the
hide
of
his
own
cows
and
calves
sowing
and
he
walks
religiously
bareheaded
to
that
work
his
head
is
bald
just
at
the
very
top
but
all
the
rest
of
him
shamefully
hairy
a

a

of

stands
out
from
his
face

knew
the
day
of
the

what
need
had
he
of
that
he
had
no
bills
to
be
met
on
a
certain
date
the
marks
on
his
almanac
were
to
show
the
time
when
each
of
the
cows
should
bear

he
knew
olaf

in
the
autumn
that
by
then
his
hay
must
be
in
and
he
knew
candlemas
in
spring

that
three
weeks
after

the

came
out
of
their
winter
quarters
all

must
be

there

nothing

its

footnote
december
by
worster
knut
hamsun
is
now
sixty
for
years
past
he
has
been
regarded
as
the
greatest
of
living
norwegian
writers
but
he
is
still
little
known
in
england
one
or
two
attempts
have
been
made
previously
to
introduce
hamsun
work
into
this
country
but
it
was
not
until
this
year
with
the
publication
of
of
the
that
he
achieved
any
real
success
or
became
at
all
generally
known
among
english
readers
of
the
markens
gr√∂de
is
hamsun
latest
work
its
reception
here
was
one
of
immediate
and
unstinted
appreciation
such
as
is
rarely
accorded
to
a
translated
work
by
an
alien
author
practically
unknown
even
to
the
critics
a
noticeable
feature
was
the
frankness
with
which
experienced
bookmen
laid
aside
stock
phrases
and
dealt
with
this
book
as
in
response
to
a
strong
personal
appeal
to
the
reviewer
aged
with
much
knowledge
hardened
by
much
handling
of
mediocrity
it
is
a
relief
to
meet
with
a
book
that
can
and
must
be
dealt
with
so
those
readers
are
perhaps
most
fortunate
who
come
upon
such
a
book
as
this
without
foretaste
or
preparation
to
the
mind
under
spell
of
an
aesthetic
or
emotional
appeal
the
steps
that
went
to
make
it
the
stages
whereby
the
author
passed
are
as
irrelevant
as
the
logarithms
that
went
to
build
an
aeroplane
yet
it
is
only
by
knowledge
of
such
steps
that
the
achievement
can
be
fully
understood
of
the
is
very
far
indeed
from
hamsun
earliest
beginnings
far
even
from
the
books
of
his
early
middle
period
which
made
his
name
it
is
the
life
story
of
a
man
in
the
wilds
the
genesis
and
gradual
development
of
a
homestead
the
unit
of
humanity
in
the
unfilled
uncleared
tracts
that
still
remain
in
the
norwegian
highlands
it
is
an
epic
of
earth
the
history
of
a
microcosm
its
dominant
note
is
one
of
patient
strength
and
simplicity
the
mainstay
of
its
working
is
the
tacit
stern
yet
loving
alliance
between
nature
and
the
man
who
faces
her
himself
trusting
to
himself
and
her
for
the
physical
means
of
life
and
the
spiritual
contentment
with
life
which
she
must
grant
if
he
be
worthy
modern
man
faces
nature
only
by
proxy
or
as
proxy
through
others
or
for
others
and
the
intimacy
is
lost
in
the
wilds
the
contact
is
direct
and
immediate
it
is
the
foothold
upon
earth
the
touch
of
the
soil
itself
that
gives
strength
the
story
is
epic
in
its
magnitude
in
its
calm
steady
progress
and
unhurrying
rhythm
in
its
vast
and
intimate
humanity
the
author
looks
upon
his
characters
with
a
great
sympathy
aloof
yet
kindly
as
a
god
a
more
objective
work
of
fiction
it
would
be
hard
to
find
certainly
in
what
used
to
be
called
the
neurasthenic
north
and
this
from
the
pen
of
the
man
who
wrote
and
hamsun
early
work
was
subjective
in
the
extreme
so
much
so
indeed
as
almost
to
lie
outside
the
limits
of
aesthetic
composition
as
a
boy
he
wrote
verse
under
difficulties
he
was
born
in
gudbrandsdalen
but
came
as
a
child
to
bod√∂
in
lofoten
and
worked
with
a
shoemaker
there
for
some
years
saving
up
money
for
the
publication
of
his
juvenile
efforts
he
had
little
education
to
speak
of
and
after
a
period
of
varying
casual
occupations
mostly
of
the
humblest
sort
he
came
to
christiania
with
the
object
of
studying
there
but
failed
to
make
his
way
twice
he
essayed
his
fortune
in
america
but
without
success
for
three
years
he
worked
as
a
fisherman
on
the
newfoundland
banks
his
nordland
origin
is
in
itself
significant
it
means
an
environment
of
nights
and
concentrated
summers
in
which
all
feelings
are
intensified
and
love
and
dread
and
gratitude
and
longing
are
nearer
and
deeper
than
in
milder
and
more
temperate
regions
where
elemental
opposites
are
as
it
were
reciprocally
diluted
in
at
the
age
of
thirty
hamsun
attracted
attention
by
the
publication
of
hunger
is
a
record
of
weeks
of
starvation
in
a
city
the
confession
of
a
man
whose
physical
and
mental
faculties
have
slipped
beyond
control
he
speaks
and
acts
irrationally
and
knows
it
watches
himself
at
his
mental
antics
and
takes
himself
to
task
for
the
same
and
he
asks
himself
is
it
a
sign
of
madness
it
might
seem
so
the
extraordinary
associations
the
weird
fancies
and
bizarre
impulses
that
are
here
laid
bare
give
an
air
of
convincing
verisimilitude
to
the
supposed
confessions
of
a
starving
journalist
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
hamsun
has
no
need
of
extraneous
influences
to
invest
his
characters
with
originality
starving
or
fed
they
can
be
equally
erratic
this
is
seen
in
his
next
book
here
we
have
actions
and
reactions
as
fantastic
as
in
though
the
hero
has
here
no
such
excuse
as
in
the
former
case
the
mysteries
or
mystifications
of
nagel
a
stranger
who
comes
for
no
particular
reason
apparent
to
stay
in
a
little
norwegian
town
arise
entirely
out
of
nagel
own
personality
is
one
of
the
most
exasperating
books
that
a
reader
or
a
conscientious
reviewer
could
be
given
to
deal
with
an
analysis
of
the
principal
character
is
a
most
baffling
task
one
is
tempted
to
call
him
mad
and
have
done
with
it
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
uncompromisingly
unrestrainedly
human
he
goes
about
constantly
saying
and
doing
things
that
we
ordinary
and
respectable
people
are
trained
and
accustomed
to
refrain
from
saying
or
doing
at
all
he
has
the
of
a
sensitive
child
he
is
for
ever
thinking
of
what
people
think
of
him
and
trying
to
create
an
impression
then
with
a
paradoxical
sincerity
he
confesses
that
the
motive
of
this
or
that
action
simply
to
create
an
impression
and
thereby
destroys
the
impression
sometimes
he
caps
this
by
wilfully
letting
it
appear
that
the
double
move
was
carefully
designed
to
produce
the
reverse
impression
of
the
first
until
the
person
concerned
is
utterly
bewildered
and
the
reader
likewise
appeared
in
in
the
following
year
hamsun
astonished
his
critics
with
two
books
new
ground
and
both
equally
unlike
his
previous
work
with
these
he
passes
at
a
bound
from
stories
portrait
studies
of
eccentric
characters
in
a
remote
or
restricted
environment
to
group
subjects
chosen
from
centres
of
life
and
culture
in
christiania
of
course
means
editor
deals
largely
with
political
manoeuvres
and
intrigues
the
bitter
controversial
politics
of
norway
prior
to
the
dissolution
of
the
union
with
sweden
gives
an
unflattering
picture
of
the
academic
literary
and
artistic
youth
of
the
capital
idlers
for
the
most
part
arrogant
unscrupulous
and
full
of
disdain
for
the
mere
citizens
and
merchants
whose
simple
honesty
and
kindliness
are
laughed
at
or
exploited
by
the
newly
dominant
representatives
of
culture
both
these
books
are
technically
superior
to
the
first
two
inasmuch
as
they
show
mastery
of
a
more
difficult
form
but
their
appeal
is
not
so
great
there
is
lacking
a
something
that
might
be
inspiration
personal
sympathy
some
indefinable
essential
that
the
author
himself
has
taught
us
to
expect
they
are
less
than
most
of
hamsun
work
hamsun
is
at
his
best
among
the
scenes
and
characters
he
loves
tenderness
and
sympathy
make
up
so
great
a
part
of
his
charm
that
he
is
hardly
recognizable
in
surroundings
or
society
uncongenial
to
himself
it
would
almost
seem
as
if
he
realized
something
of
this
for
in
his
next
work
he
turns
from
the
capital
to
the
nordland
coast
reverting
also
in
some
degree
to
the
subjective
keenly
sensitive
manner
of
though
now
with
more
restraint
and
concentration
is
probably
hamsun
work
it
is
a
but
of
an
extraordinary
type
and
is
moreover
important
from
the
fact
that
we
are
here
introduced
to
some
of
the
characters
and
types
that
are
destined
to
reappear
again
and
again
in
his
later
works
nagel
the
exasperating
irresponsible
of
is
at
his
maddest
in
his
behaviour
towards
the
woman
he
loves
it
is
natural
that
this
should
be
so
when
a
man
is
intoxicated
his
essential
qualities
are
emphasized
if
he
have
wit
he
will
be
witty
if
a
brutal
nature
he
will
be
a
brute
if
he
be
of
a
melancholy
temper
he
will
be
disposed
to
sit
upon
the
ground
and
tell
sad
stories
of
the
death
of
kings
we
see
this
in
the
of
the
hero
is
characterized
by
the
same
irrational
impulses
the
same
extravagant
actions
as
in
and
but
they
are
now
less
frequent
and
less
involved
the
book
as
a
whole
is
toned
down
so
to
speak
from
the
bewildering
tangle
of
unrestraint
in
the
first
two
there
is
quite
sufficient
of
the
erratic
and
unusual
in
the
character
of
glahn
the
hero
but
the
tone
is
more
subdued
the
madcap
youth
of
genius
has
realized
that
the
world
looks
frigidly
at
its
vagaries
and
the
secretly
proud
je
suis
autre
more
a
boast
than
a
confession
gives
place
to
a
wistful
apologetic
admission
of
the
difference
as
a
fault
here
already
we
have
something
of
that
resignation
which
comes
later
to
its
fulness
in
the
story
of
the
wanderer
with
the
mute
the
in
takes
the
form
of
a
conflict
it
is
one
of
those
battles
between
the
sexes
duels
of
wit
and
such
as
one
finds
in
the
plays
of
marivaux
but
hamsun
sets
his
battle
in
the
sign
of
the
heart
not
of
the
head
it
is
a
of
feeling
none
the
less
deep
for
its
erratic
utterance
moreover
the
scene
is
laid
not
in
salons
and
but
in
a
landscape
such
as
hamsun
loves
the
hills
above
a
little
fishing
village
between
the
and
the
sea
and
interwoven
with
the
story
like
an
eerie
breathing
from
the
dark
of
woods
at
dusk
and
dawn
is
the
haunting
presence
of
iselin
belle
dame
sans
otto
weininger
the
author
of
and
said
of
that
it
was
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
novel
ever
written
weininger
of
course
was
an
extremist
and
few
would
accept
his
judgment
without
reserve
it
is
doubtful
whether
any
writer
nowadays
would
venture
to
make
such
a
claim
for
any
book
at
all
is
a
book
that
offends
against
all
sorts
of
rules
as
a
literary
product
it
is
eminently
calculated
to
elicit
especially
in
england
the
olympian
this
will
never
do
to
begin
with
it
is
not
so
much
a
novel
as
a
a
form
of
art
little
cultivated
in
this
country
but
which
lends
itself
excellently
to
delicate
artistic
handling
and
the
creation
of
that
subtle
influence
which
hamsun
countrymen
call
poorly
rendered
by
the
english
atmosphere
the
epilogue
is
disproportionately
long
the
portion
written
as
by
another
hand
is
all
too
recognizably
in
the
style
of
the
rest
and
with
all
his
chivalrous
sacrifice
and
violent
end
glahn
is
at
best
a
quixotic
hero
men
as
men
would
think
him
rather
a
fool
and
women
as
women
might
flush
at
the
thought
of
a
cavalier
so
embarrassingly
unrestrained
he
is
not
to
be
idolized
as
a
cinema
star
or
the
literary
gymnastic
hero
of
a
perennial
earl
court
exhibition
set
to
music
on
the
stage
he
could
not
be
truthfully
portrayed
on
a
flamboyant
wrapper
as
at
all
seductively
masculine
in
a
word
he
is
neither
a
man
man
nor
a
woman
man
but
he
is
a
human
being
keenly
susceptible
to
influence
which
most
of
us
have
felt
in
some
degree
closely
allied
to
is
likewise
a
story
of
conflict
between
two
lovers
the
actual
plot
can
only
be
described
as
hackneyed
girl
and
boy
the
rich
man
daughter
and
the
poor
son
playmates
in
youth
then
separated
by
the
barriers
of
social
standing
few
but
the
most
hardened
of
catering
for
suburbia
would
venture
nowadays
to
handle
such
a
theme
yet
hamsun
dares
and
so
insistently
unlike
all
else
is
the
impress
of
his
personality
that
the
mechanical
structure
of
the
story
is
forgotten
it
is
interspersed
with
irrelevant
fancies
visions
and
imaginings
a
chain
of
tied
notes
heard
as
an
undertone
through
the
action
on
the
surface
the
effect
is
that
of
something
straining
towards
an
impossible
realization
a
beating
of
wings
in
the
void
a
striving
for
utterance
of
things
beyond
speech
is
the
of
hamsun
subjective
period
already
in
the
three
plays
which
appeared
during
the
years
immediately
following
he
faces
the
merciless
law
of
change
the
unrelenting
forward
which
means
leaving
loved
things
behind
kareno
student
of
life
begins
his
career
in
resolute
opposition
to
the
old
men
the
established
authorities
who
stand
for
compromise
and
resignation
for
twenty
years
he
remains
obstinately
faithful
to
his
creed
that
the
old
men
must
step
aside
or
be
thrust
aside
to
make
way
for
the
youth
that
will
be
served
what
has
age
that
youth
has
not
experience
experience
in
all
its
poor
and
withered
nakedness
and
what
use
is
their
experience
to
us
who
must
make
our
own
in
every
single
happening
of
life
in
the
sunset
of
the
trilogy
kareno
himself
deserts
the
cause
of
youth
and
allies
himself
to
the
party
in
power
and
the
final
scene
shows
him
telling
a
story
to
a
child
there
was
once
a
man
who
never
would
give
way
the
madness
of
is
excused
as
being
delirium
due
to
physical
suffering
nagel
in
is
shown
as
a
fool
an
eccentric
intolerable
in
ordinary
society
though
he
is
disconcertingly
human
paradoxically
sane
glahn
in
apologizes
for
his
uncouth
straightforwardness
by
confessing
that
he
is
more
at
home
in
the
woods
where
he
can
say
and
do
what
he
pleases
without
offence
johannes
in
is
of
humble
birth
which
counts
in
extenuation
of
his
unmannerly
frankness
in
early
years
later
he
becomes
a
poet
and
as
such
is
exempt
in
some
degree
from
the
conventional
restraint
imposed
on
those
who
aspire
to
polite
society
all
these
characters
are
made
to
serve
the
purpose
as
channels
for
poetic
utterance
that
might
otherwise
seem
irrelevant
the
extent
to
which
this
is
done
may
be
seen
from
the
way
in
which
hamsun
lets
a
character
in
one
book
enter
upon
a
theme
which
later
becomes
the
subject
of
an
independent
work
by
the
author
himself
thus
glahn
is
haunted
by
visions
of
diderik
and
iselin
johannes
writes
fragments
supposed
to
be
spoken
by
one
vendt
the
monk
five
years
after
hamsun
gives
us
the
romantic
drama
of
in
which
diderik
and
iselin
appear
throughout
these
early
works
hamsun
is
striving
to
find
expression
for
his
own
sensitive
personality
a
form
and
degree
of
expression
sufficient
to
relieve
his
own
tension
of
feeling
without
fusing
the
medium
adequate
to
his
own
needs
yet
understandable
and
tolerable
to
ordinary
human
beings
to
the
readers
of
books
the
process
in
effect
is
simply
this
hamsun
is
a
poet
with
a
poet
deep
and
unusual
feeling
and
a
poet
need
of
utterance
to
gain
a
hearing
he
chooses
figures
whom
he
can
conveniently
represent
as
fools
secretly
he
loves
them
for
they
are
himself
but
to
the
world
he
can
present
them
with
a
polite
apology
a
plea
for
kindly
indulgence
it
is
not
infrequent
in
literature
to
find
the
wisest
and
most
poignant
utterances
thus
laid
in
the
mouths
of
poor
men
clad
in
motley
some
of
the
most
daring
things
in
shakespeare
the
newest
heresies
of
the
renaissance
are
voiced
by
irresponsibles
of
all
dramatic
figures
that
of
the
fool
is
most
suited
to
the
expression
of
concentrated
feeling
there
is
an
arresting
question
in
a
play
of
recent
years
which
runs
something
like
this
do
you
think
that
the
things
people
make
fools
of
themselves
about
are
any
less
real
and
true
than
the
things
they
behave
sensibly
about
most
of
us
have
at
some
time
or
another
felt
that
uncomfortable
almost
indecently
denuding
question
which
comes
to
us
at
rare
moments
from
the
stage
where
some
great
drama
is
being
played
what
is
higher
what
is
more
real
this
or
the
life
we
live
in
that
sudden
flash
the
matters
of
today
and
tomorrow
reality
in
our
minds
appear
as
vulgar
trifles
things
of
which
we
are
ashamed
the
feeling
lasts
but
a
moment
for
a
moment
we
have
been
something
higher
than
ourselves
in
the
mere
desire
so
to
be
then
we
fall
back
to
ourselves
once
more
to
the
lower
levels
upon
which
alone
we
can
exist
and
yet
it
is
by
such
potentials
that
we
judge
the
highest
art
by
its
power
to
give
us
if
only
for
a
moment
something
of
that
which
the
divinity
of
our
aspiring
minds
finds
wanting
in
the
confines
of
reality
the
richness
of
this
quality
is
one
of
the
most
endearing
things
in
hamsun
characters
their
sensitiveness
is
a
thing
we
have
been
trained
for
to
repress
it
is
well
for
us
no
doubt
that
this
is
so
but
we
are
grateful
for
their
showing
that
such
things
as
we
are
grateful
for
kensington
gardens
who
can
not
live
where
trees
are
everywhere
the
figures
hamsun
sets
before
us
as
confessedly
unsuited
to
the
realities
of
life
his
vagabonds
his
failures
his
fools
have
power
at
times
to
make
us
question
whether
our
world
of
comfort
luxury
success
is
what
we
thought
if
it
were
not
well
lost
in
exchange
for
the
power
to
as
they
it
has
been
said
that
life
is
a
comedy
to
those
who
think
a
tragedy
to
those
who
feel
humanly
speaking
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
merits
of
hamsun
work
that
he
shows
otherwise
his
attitude
towards
life
is
throughout
one
of
feeling
yet
he
makes
of
life
no
tragedy
but
a
beautiful
story
i
will
be
young
until
i
die
says
kareno
in
the
words
are
not
so
much
a
challenge
to
fate
as
a
denial
of
fact
he
is
not
fighting
only
refusing
to
acknowledge
the
power
that
is
already
hard
upon
him
kareno
is
an
character
he
is
a
philosopher
a
man
whose
perceptions
and
activity
lie
predominantly
in
the
sphere
of
thought
not
of
feeling
his
attempt
to
carry
the
fire
of
youth
beyond
the
grave
of
youth
ends
in
disaster
an
unnecessary
due
to
his
gratuitously
attempting
the
impossible
hamsun
the
spirit
we
have
seen
striving
for
expression
through
the
figures
of
nagel
glahn
johannes
and
the
rest
is
a
creature
of
and
here
the
development
proceeds
on
altogether
different
lines
the
emotion
which
fails
to
find
adequate
outlet
even
in
such
works
as
and
might
well
seem
more
of
a
peril
than
the
quixotic
stubbornness
of
kareno
philosophy
such
a
flood
in
its
tempestuous
unrest
might
seem
to
threaten
destruction
or
at
best
the
vain
dispersal
of
its
own
power
into
chaos
but
by
some
rare
guidance
it
is
led
after
the
storm
of
into
channels
of
beneficent
fertility
in
after
an
interval
of
short
stories
letters
of
travel
and
poems
came
the
story
entitled
the
word
means
moths
it
also
stands
for
something
else
something
for
which
we
english
as
a
sensible
people
have
no
word
something
pleasantly
futile
deliciously
unprofitable
foolish
lovers
hovering
like
moths
about
a
lamp
but
there
is
more
than
this
that
is
untranslatable
in
the
title
a
title
it
suggests
an
attitude
of
gentleness
tenderness
sympathy
toward
whomsoever
it
describes
it
is
a
new
note
in
hamsun
the
opening
of
a
new
the
main
thread
of
the
story
bears
a
certain
similarity
to
that
of
and
being
a
love
affair
of
mazy
windings
a
tangled
skein
of
but
it
is
pure
comedy
throughout
rolandsen
the
telegraph
operator
in
love
with
elsie
mack
is
no
poet
he
has
not
even
any
pretensions
to
education
or
social
standing
he
is
a
cheerful
riotous
blade
who
sports
with
the
girls
of
the
village
gets
drunk
at
times
and
serenades
the
parson
wife
at
night
with
his
guitar
is
the
slightest
of
little
stories
in
itself
but
full
of
delightful
vagaries
and
the
most
winning
humour
the
story
of
with
its
continuation
is
in
like
vein
a
tenderly
humorous
portrayal
of
love
below
stairs
the
principal
characters
being
chosen
from
the
class
who
appear
as
supers
in
subjects
or
retainers
of
the
trader
mack
it
is
as
if
the
in
one
of
shakespeare
plays
had
been
taken
out
for
separate
presentment
and
the
clown
promoted
to
be
hero
in
a
play
of
his
own
the
cast
is
increased
the
lightly
drawn
in
is
now
shown
more
comprehensively
and
in
detail
making
us
gradually
acquainted
with
a
whole
little
community
a
village
world
knowing
little
of
any
world
beyond
and
forming
a
microcosm
in
itself
hamsun
has
returned
as
it
were
to
the
scene
of
his
passionate
youth
but
in
altered
guise
he
plays
no
part
himself
now
but
is
an
onlooker
a
chronicling
as
from
a
cloistered
aloofness
yet
with
kindly
wisdom
always
the
little
things
that
matter
in
the
lives
of
those
around
him
wisdom
and
kindliness
sympathy
and
humour
and
understanding
these
are
the
dominant
notes
of
the
new
phase
ends
happily
for
it
is
a
story
of
other
people
lives
so
also
with
benoni
and
rosa
at
the
last
and
so
surely
has
the
author
established
his
foothold
on
the
new
ground
that
he
can
even
bring
in
edvarda
the
iselin
figure
from
once
more
thus
linking
up
his
brave
and
lusty
comedies
of
middle
age
with
the
romantic
tragedies
of
his
youth
making
a
comprehensive
of
humanity
meantime
the
effect
upon
himself
is
seen
and
avowed
between
and
comes
the
frankly
narrative
of
a
vagabond
who
describes
himself
upon
interrogation
as
knut
pedersen
which
is
of
knut
pedersen
hamsund
and
hailing
from
nordland
which
embraces
lofoten
it
does
not
need
any
showing
of
paper
however
to
establish
the
identity
of
knut
pedersen
vagabond
with
the
author
of
the
opening
words
of
the
book
under
h√∂ststjaernen
are
enough
indian
summer
mild
and
warm
it
is
many
years
now
since
i
knew
such
peace
twenty
or
thirty
years
maybe
or
maybe
it
was
in
another
life
but
i
have
felt
it
some
time
surely
since
i
go
about
now
humming
a
little
tune
go
about
rejoicing
loving
every
straw
and
every
stone
and
feeling
as
if
they
cared
for
me
in
return
this
is
the
hamsun
of
but
hamsun
now
is
a
greater
soul
than
in
the
days
when
glahn
the
solitary
dweller
in
the
woods
picked
up
a
broken
twig
from
the
ground
and
held
it
lovingly
because
it
looked
poor
and
forsaken
or
thanked
the
hillock
of
stone
outside
his
hut
because
it
stood
there
faithfully
as
a
friend
that
waited
his
return
he
is
stronger
now
but
no
less
delicate
he
loves
not
nature
less
but
the
world
more
he
has
learned
to
love
his
knut
pedersen
vagabond
wanders
about
the
country
with
his
grindhusen
the
painter
who
can
ditch
and
delve
at
a
pinch
or
falkenberg
in
and
where
pianos
are
here
is
brave
comradeship
the
sharing
of
adventures
the
ready
wit
of
jovial
vagrants
the
book
is
a
harmless
picaresque
a
of
innocent
its
place
is
with
and
cloister
and
the
in
that
ancient
endless
order
of
tales
which
link
up
age
with
age
and
land
with
land
in
the
unaltering
unfrontiered
fellowship
of
the
road
that
kept
the
spirit
of
poetry
alive
through
the
dark
ages
the
vagabond
from
nordland
has
his
own
adventures
his
there
is
a
touch
of
sterne
about
the
book
not
the
exaggerated
of
tristram
shandy
with
blanks
and
marbled
pages
but
the
fluent
casual
sterne
of
the
yet
the
vagabond
himself
is
unobtrusive
ready
to
step
back
and
be
a
chronicler
the
moment
other
figures
enter
into
constellation
he
moves
among
youth
himself
no
longer
young
and
among
gentlefolk
as
one
making
no
claim
to
equal
rank
both
these
features
are
accentuated
further
in
the
story
of
the
wanderer
with
the
mute
it
is
a
continuation
of
and
forms
the
culmination
the
acquiescent
close
of
the
series
that
began
with
the
discords
of
tortured
loveliness
are
now
resolved
into
an
ultimate
harmony
of
comely
resignation
and
rich
content
a
wanderer
may
come
to
fifty
years
he
plays
more
softly
then
plays
with
muted
strings
this
is
the
keynote
of
the
book
the
wanderer
is
no
longer
young
it
is
for
youth
to
make
the
stories
old
men
tell
tragedy
is
reserved
for
those
of
high
estate
a
wanderer
in
corduroy
such
as
labourers
wear
here
in
the
south
can
tell
the
story
of
his
chatelaine
and
her
lovers
with
the
of
a
humbler
henry
esmond
winning
nothing
for
himself
even
at
the
last
yet
feeling
he
is
still
in
debt
hamsun
next
work
is
siste
literally
the
last
joy
the
title
as
it
stands
is
expressive
the
substantive
is
joy
but
it
is
so
qualified
by
the
preceding
last
a
word
of
overwhelming
influence
in
any
combination
that
the
total
effect
is
one
of
sadness
and
the
book
itself
is
a
masterly
presentment
of
gloom
masterly
or
most
natural
it
is
often
hard
to
say
how
much
of
hamsun
effect
is
due
to
superlative
technique
and
how
much
to
the
inspired
disregard
of
all
technique
siste
is
a
diary
of
wearisome
days
spent
for
the
most
part
among
unattractive
insignificant
people
at
a
holiday
resort
the
only
action
in
it
is
an
altogether
pitiful
love
affair
in
which
the
narrator
is
involved
to
the
slightest
possible
degree
the
writer
is
throughout
despondent
he
feels
himself
out
of
the
race
his
day
is
past
solitude
and
quiet
nature
and
his
own
foolish
feelings
these
are
the
last
joys
left
him
now
the
book
might
have
seemed
a
fitting
if
pathetic
ending
to
the
literary
career
of
the
author
of
certainly
it
holds
out
no
promise
of
further
energy
or
interest
in
life
or
work
the
closing
words
amount
to
a
personal
farewell
then
without
warning
hamsun
enters
upon
a
new
phase
of
power
av
children
of
the
age
is
an
objective
study
its
main
theme
being
the
marriage
conflict
touched
upon
in
the
wanderer
stories
and
here
developed
in
a
different
setting
and
with
fuller
individuality
hamsun
has
here
moved
up
a
step
in
the
social
scale
from
villagers
of
the
benoni
type
to
the
class
there
is
the
same
conflict
of
temperaments
that
we
have
seen
before
but
less
violent
now
the
poet
calm
of
mind
and
the
level
of
culture
from
which
his
characters
now
are
drawn
perhaps
by
instinctive
selection
make
for
restraint
still
a
romantic
at
heart
he
becomes
more
classic
in
form
av
is
also
the
story
of
segelfoss
in
its
passing
from
the
tranquil
dignity
of
a
estate
to
the
complex
and
ruthless
modernity
of
an
industrial
centre
treats
of
the
fortunes
of
the
succeeding
generation
and
the
further
development
of
segelfoss
into
a
township
by
then
with
of
the
hamsun
achieves
his
greatest
triumph
setting
aside
all
that
mattered
most
to
himself
he
turns
with
the
experience
of
a
lifetime
rich
in
conflict
to
the
things
that
matter
to
us
all
deliberately
shorn
of
all
that
makes
for
mere
effect
isak
stands
out
as
an
elemental
figure
the
symbol
of
man
at
his
best
face
to
face
with
nature
and
life
there
is
no
greater
human
character
reverently
said
in
the
bible
itself
these
then
are
the
steps
of
hamsun
progress
as
an
author
from
the
passionate
chaos
of
to
the
miltonic
monumental
calm
of
of
the
the
stages
in
themselves
are
full
of
beauty
the
wistfulness
of
and
the
kindly
humour
of
and
the
resignation
of
the
wanderer
with
the
mute
they
follow
as
the
seasons
do
each
with
a
charm
of
its
own
yet
all
deriving
from
one
source
his
muse
at
first
is
iselin
the
embodiment
of
adolescent
longing
the
dream
of
those
whom
delight
flies
because
they
give
her
chase
the
hopelessness
of
his
own
pursuit
fills
him
with
pity
for
mortals
under
the
same
spell
and
he
steps
aside
to
be
a
brave
encouraging
chorus
or
a
kindly
chronicler
of
others
lives
and
his
reward
is
the
love
of
a
greater
divinity
the
goddess
of
field
and
homestead
no
but
a
presence
of
wisdom
and
calm
the
end
