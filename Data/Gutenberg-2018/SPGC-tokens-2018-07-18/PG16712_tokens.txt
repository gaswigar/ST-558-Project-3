essays
originally
appeared
i
locke
and
the
frontiers
of
common
sense
a
good
portrait
of
locke
would
require
an
elaborate
background
his
is
not
a
figure
to
stand
statuesquely
in
a
void
the
pose
might
not
seem
grand
enough
for
bronze
or
marble
rather
he
should
be
painted
in
the
manner
of
the
dutch
masters
in
a
sunny
interior
scrupulously
furnished
with
all
the
implements
of
domestic
comfort
and
philosophic
enquiry
the
holy
bible
open
majestically
before
him
and
beside
it
that
other
revelation
the
terrestrial
globe
his
hand
might
be
pointing
to
a
microscope
set
for
examining
the
internal
constitution
of
a
beetle
but
for
the
moment
his
eye
should
be
seen
wandering
through
the
open
window
to
admire
the
blessings
of
thrift
and
liberty
manifest
in
the
people
so
worthily
busy
in
the
wrong
as
many
a
monkish
notion
might
be
that
still
troubled
their
poor
heads
from
them
his
enlarged
thoughts
would
easily
pass
to
the
stout
carved
ships
in
the
river
beyond
intrepidly
setting
sail
for
the
indies
or
for
savage
america
yes
he
too
had
travelled
and
not
only
in
thought
he
knew
how
many
strange
nations
and
false
religions
lodged
in
this
round
earth
itself
but
a
speck
in
the
universe
there
were
few
ingenious
authors
that
he
had
not
perused
or
philosophical
instruments
that
he
had
not
as
far
as
possible
examined
and
tested
and
no
man
better
than
he
could
understand
and
prize
the
recent
discoveries
of
the
incomparable
mr
newton
nevertheless
a
certain
uneasiness
in
that
spare
frame
a
certain
knitting
of
the
brows
in
that
aquiline
countenance
would
suggest
that
in
the
midst
of
their
earnest
eloquence
the
philosopher
thoughts
might
sometimes
come
to
a
stand
indeed
the
visible
scene
did
not
exhaust
the
complexity
of
his
problem
for
there
was
also
what
he
called
the
scene
of
ideas
immaterial
and
private
but
often
more
crowded
and
pressing
than
the
public
scene
locke
was
the
father
of
modern
psychology
and
the
birth
of
this
airy
monster
this
changeling
was
not
altogether
easy
or
fortunate
i
wish
my
erudition
allowed
me
to
fill
in
this
picture
as
the
subject
deserves
and
to
trace
home
the
sources
of
locke
opinions
and
their
immense
influence
unfortunately
i
can
consider
him
what
is
hardly
fair
only
as
a
pure
philosopher
for
had
locke
mind
been
more
profound
it
might
have
been
less
influential
he
was
in
sympathy
with
the
coming
age
and
was
able
to
guide
it
an
age
that
confided
in
easy
eloquent
reasoning
and
proposed
to
be
saved
in
this
world
and
the
next
with
as
little
philosophy
and
as
little
religion
as
possible
locke
played
in
the
eighteenth
century
very
much
the
part
that
fell
to
kant
in
the
nineteenth
when
quarrelled
with
no
less
than
when
embraced
his
opinions
became
a
point
of
departure
for
universal
developments
the
more
we
look
into
the
matter
the
more
we
are
impressed
by
the
patriarchal
dignity
of
mind
father
of
psychology
father
of
the
criticism
of
knowledge
father
of
theoretical
liberalism
at
least
of
the
american
political
system
of
voltaire
and
the
encyclopaedia
at
home
he
was
the
ancestor
of
that
whole
school
of
polite
moderate
opinion
which
can
unite
liberal
christianity
with
mechanical
science
and
with
psychological
idealism
he
was
invincibly
rooted
in
a
prudential
morality
in
a
rationalised
protestantism
in
respect
for
liberty
and
law
above
all
he
was
deeply
convinced
as
he
puts
it
that
the
handsome
conveniences
of
life
are
better
than
nasty
penury
locke
still
speaks
or
spoke
until
lately
through
many
a
modern
mind
when
this
mind
was
most
sincere
and
two
hundred
years
before
queen
victoria
he
was
a
victorian
in
essence
a
chief
element
in
this
modernness
of
locke
was
something
that
had
hardly
appeared
before
in
pure
philosophy
although
common
in
religion
i
mean
the
tendency
to
deny
one
own
presuppositions
not
by
accident
or
inadvertently
but
proudly
and
with
an
air
of
triumph
presuppositions
are
imposed
on
all
of
us
by
life
itself
for
instance
the
presupposition
that
life
is
to
continue
and
that
it
is
worth
living
belief
is
born
on
the
wing
and
awakes
to
many
tacit
commitments
afterwards
in
reflection
we
may
wonder
at
finding
these
presuppositions
on
our
hands
and
being
ignorant
of
the
natural
causes
which
have
imposed
them
on
the
animal
mind
we
may
be
offended
at
them
their
arbitrary
and
dogmatic
character
will
tempt
us
to
condemn
them
and
to
take
for
granted
that
the
analysis
which
undermines
them
is
justified
and
will
prove
fruitful
but
this
critical
assurance
in
its
turn
seems
to
rely
on
a
dubious
presupposition
namely
that
human
opinion
must
always
evolve
in
a
single
line
dialectically
providentially
and
irresistibly
it
is
at
least
conceivable
that
the
opposite
should
sometimes
be
the
case
some
of
the
primitive
presuppositions
of
human
reason
might
have
been
correct
and
inevitable
whilst
the
tendency
to
deny
them
might
have
sprung
from
a
plausible
misunderstanding
or
the
exaggeration
of
a
so
that
the
critical
opinion
itself
after
destroying
the
spontaneous
assumptions
on
which
it
rested
might
be
incapable
of
subsisting
in
locke
the
central
presuppositions
which
he
embraced
heartily
and
without
question
were
those
of
common
sense
he
adopted
what
he
calls
a
plain
historical
method
fit
in
his
own
words
to
be
brought
into
company
and
polite
conversation
men
barely
by
the
use
of
their
natural
faculties
might
attain
to
all
the
knowledge
possible
or
worth
having
all
children
he
writes
that
are
born
into
this
world
being
surrounded
with
bodies
that
perpetually
and
diversely
affect
them
have
a
variety
of
ideas
imprinted
on
their
minds
external
material
things
as
objects
of
sensation
and
the
operations
of
our
own
minds
as
objects
of
reflection
are
to
me
he
continues
the
only
originals
from
which
all
our
ideas
take
their
beginnings
every
act
of
sensation
he
writes
elsewhere
when
duly
considered
gives
us
an
equal
view
of
both
parts
of
nature
the
corporeal
and
the
spiritual
for
whilst
i
know
by
seeing
or
hearing
that
there
is
some
corporeal
being
without
me
the
object
of
that
sensation
i
do
more
certainly
know
that
there
is
some
spiritual
being
within
me
that
sees
and
hears
resting
on
these
clear
perceptions
the
natural
philosophy
of
locke
falls
into
two
parts
one
strictly
physical
and
scientific
the
other
critical
and
psychological
in
respect
to
the
composition
of
matter
locke
accepted
the
most
advanced
theory
of
his
day
which
happened
to
be
a
very
old
one
the
theory
of
democritus
that
the
material
universe
contains
nothing
but
a
multitude
of
solid
atoms
coursing
through
infinite
space
but
locke
added
a
religious
note
to
this
materialism
by
suggesting
that
infinite
space
in
its
sublimity
must
be
an
attribute
of
god
he
also
believed
what
few
materialists
would
venture
to
assert
that
if
we
could
thoroughly
examine
the
cosmic
mechanism
we
should
see
the
demonstrable
necessity
of
every
complication
that
ensues
even
of
the
existence
and
character
of
mind
for
it
was
no
harder
for
god
to
endow
matter
with
the
power
of
thinking
than
to
endow
it
with
the
power
of
moving
in
the
atomic
theory
we
have
a
graphic
image
asserted
to
describe
accurately
or
even
exhaustively
the
intrinsic
constitution
of
things
or
their
primary
qualities
perhaps
in
so
far
as
physical
hypotheses
must
remain
graphic
at
all
it
is
an
inevitable
theory
it
was
first
suggested
by
the
wearing
out
and
dissolution
of
all
material
objects
and
by
the
specks
of
dust
floating
in
a
sunbeam
and
it
is
confirmed
on
an
enlarged
scale
by
the
stellar
universe
as
conceived
by
modern
astronomy
when
today
we
talk
of
nuclei
and
electrons
if
we
imagine
them
at
all
we
imagine
them
as
atoms
but
it
is
all
a
picture
prophesying
what
we
might
see
through
a
sufficiently
powerful
microscope
the
important
philosophical
question
is
the
one
raised
by
the
other
half
of
natural
philosophy
by
optics
and
the
general
criticism
of
perception
how
far
if
at
all
may
we
trust
the
images
in
our
minds
to
reveal
the
nature
of
external
things
on
this
point
the
doctrine
of
locke
through
descartes
was
also
derived
from
democritus
it
was
that
all
the
sensible
qualities
of
things
except
position
shape
solidity
number
and
motion
were
only
ideas
in
us
projected
and
falsely
regarded
as
lodged
in
things
in
the
things
these
imputed
or
secondary
qualities
were
simply
powers
inherent
in
their
atomic
constitution
and
calculated
to
excite
sensations
of
that
character
in
our
bodies
this
doctrine
is
readily
established
by
locke
plain
historical
method
when
applied
to
the
study
of
rainbows
mirrors
effects
of
perspective
dreams
jaundice
madness
and
the
will
to
believe
all
of
which
go
to
convince
us
that
the
ideas
which
we
impulsively
assume
to
be
qualities
of
objects
are
always
in
their
seat
and
origin
evolved
in
our
own
heads
these
two
parts
of
locke
natural
philosophy
however
are
not
in
perfect
equilibrium
the
feelings
and
ideas
of
an
animal
must
be
equally
conditioned
by
his
organs
and
passions
and
he
can
not
be
aware
of
what
goes
on
beyond
him
except
as
it
affects
his
own
life
how
then
could
locke
or
could
democritus
suppose
that
his
ideas
of
space
and
atoms
were
less
human
less
graphic
summary
and
symbolic
than
his
sensations
of
sound
or
colour
the
language
of
science
no
less
than
that
of
sense
should
have
been
recognised
to
be
a
human
language
and
the
nature
of
anything
existent
collateral
with
ourselves
be
that
collateral
existence
material
or
mental
should
have
been
confessed
to
be
a
subject
for
faith
and
for
hypothesis
never
by
any
possibility
for
absolute
or
direct
intuition
there
is
no
occasion
to
take
alarm
at
this
doctrine
as
if
it
condemned
us
to
solitary
confinement
and
to
ignorance
of
the
world
in
which
we
live
we
see
and
know
the
world
through
our
eyes
and
our
intelligence
in
visual
and
in
intellectual
terms
how
else
should
a
world
be
seen
or
known
which
is
not
the
figment
of
a
dream
but
a
collateral
power
pressing
and
alien
in
the
cognisance
which
an
animal
may
take
of
his
surroundings
and
surely
all
animals
take
such
cognisance
the
subjective
and
moral
character
of
his
feelings
on
finding
himself
so
surrounded
does
not
destroy
their
cognitive
value
these
feelings
as
locke
says
are
signs
to
take
them
for
signs
is
the
essence
of
intelligence
animals
that
are
sensitive
physically
are
also
sensitive
morally
and
feel
the
friendliness
or
hostility
which
surrounds
them
even
pain
and
pleasure
are
no
idle
sensations
satisfied
with
their
own
presence
they
violently
summon
attention
to
the
objects
that
are
their
source
can
love
or
hate
be
felt
without
being
felt
towards
something
something
near
and
potent
yet
external
uncontrolled
and
mysterious
when
i
dodge
a
missile
or
pick
a
berry
is
it
likely
that
my
mind
should
stop
to
dwell
on
its
pure
sensations
or
ideas
without
recognising
or
pursuing
something
material
analytic
reflection
often
ignores
the
essential
energy
of
mind
which
is
originally
more
intelligent
than
sensuous
more
appetitive
and
dogmatic
than
aesthetic
but
the
feelings
and
ideas
of
an
active
animal
can
not
help
uniting
internal
moral
intensity
with
external
physical
reference
and
the
natural
conditions
of
sensibility
require
that
perceptions
should
owe
their
existence
and
quality
to
the
living
organism
with
its
moral
bias
and
that
at
the
same
time
they
should
be
addressed
to
the
external
objects
which
entice
that
organism
or
threaten
it
all
ambitions
must
be
defeated
when
they
ask
for
the
impossible
the
ambition
to
know
is
not
an
exception
and
certainly
our
perceptions
can
not
tell
us
how
the
world
would
look
if
nobody
saw
it
or
how
valuable
it
would
be
if
nobody
cared
for
it
but
our
perceptions
as
locke
again
said
are
sufficient
for
our
welfare
and
appropriate
to
our
condition
they
are
not
only
a
wonderful
entertainment
in
themselves
but
apart
from
their
sensuous
and
grammatical
quality
by
their
distribution
and
method
of
variation
they
may
inform
us
most
exactly
about
the
order
and
mechanism
of
nature
we
see
in
the
science
of
today
how
completely
the
most
accurate
knowledge
proved
to
be
accurate
by
its
application
in
the
arts
may
shed
every
pictorial
element
and
the
whole
language
of
experience
to
become
a
pure
method
of
calculation
and
control
and
by
a
pleasant
compensation
our
aesthetic
life
may
become
freer
more
more
humbly
happy
in
itself
and
without
trespassing
in
any
way
beyond
the
modesty
of
nature
we
may
consent
to
be
like
little
children
chirping
our
human
note
since
the
life
of
reason
in
us
may
well
become
science
in
its
validity
whilst
remaining
poetry
in
its
texture
i
think
then
that
by
a
slight
of
locke
pronouncements
in
natural
philosophy
they
could
be
made
inwardly
consistent
and
still
faithful
to
the
first
presuppositions
of
common
sense
although
certainly
far
more
chastened
and
sceptical
than
impulsive
opinion
is
likely
to
be
in
the
first
instance
there
were
other
presuppositions
in
the
philosophy
of
locke
besides
his
fundamental
naturalism
and
in
his
private
mind
probably
the
most
important
was
his
christian
faith
which
was
not
only
confident
and
sincere
but
prompted
him
at
times
to
high
speculation
he
had
friends
among
the
cambridge
platonists
and
he
found
in
newton
a
brilliant
example
of
scientific
rigour
capped
with
mystical
insights
yet
if
we
consider
locke
philosophical
position
in
the
abstract
his
christianity
almost
disappears
in
form
his
theology
and
ethics
were
strictly
rationalistic
yet
one
who
was
a
deist
in
philosophy
might
remain
a
christian
in
religion
there
was
no
great
harm
in
a
special
revelation
provided
it
were
simple
and
short
and
left
the
broad
field
of
truth
open
in
almost
every
direction
to
free
and
personal
investigation
a
free
man
and
a
good
man
would
certainly
never
admit
as
coming
from
god
any
doctrine
contrary
to
his
private
reason
or
political
interest
and
the
moral
precepts
actually
vouchsafed
to
us
in
the
gospels
were
most
acceptable
seeing
that
they
added
a
sublime
eloquence
to
maxims
which
sound
reason
would
have
arrived
at
in
any
case
evidently
common
sense
had
nothing
to
fear
from
religious
faith
of
this
character
but
the
matter
could
not
end
there
common
sense
is
not
more
convinced
of
anything
than
of
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
advantage
and
disaster
and
it
can
not
dispense
with
a
moral
interpretation
of
the
universe
socrates
who
spoke
initially
for
common
sense
even
thought
the
moral
interpretation
of
existence
the
whole
of
philosophy
he
would
not
have
seen
anything
comic
in
the
satire
of
molière
making
his
chorus
of
young
doctors
chant
in
unison
that
opium
causes
sleep
because
it
has
a
dormitive
virtue
the
virtues
or
moral
uses
of
things
according
to
socrates
were
the
reason
why
the
things
had
been
created
and
were
what
they
were
the
admirable
virtues
of
opium
defined
its
perfection
and
the
perfection
of
a
thing
was
the
full
manifestation
of
its
deepest
nature
doubtless
this
moral
interpretation
of
the
universe
had
been
overdone
and
it
had
been
a
capital
error
in
socrates
to
make
that
interpretation
exclusive
and
to
substitute
it
for
natural
philosophy
locke
who
was
himself
a
medical
man
knew
what
a
black
cloak
for
ignorance
and
villainy
scholastic
verbiage
might
be
in
that
profession
he
also
knew
being
an
enthusiast
for
experimental
science
that
in
order
to
control
the
movement
of
matter
which
is
to
realise
those
virtues
and
perfections
it
is
better
to
trace
the
movement
of
matter
materialistically
for
it
is
in
the
act
of
manifesting
its
own
powers
and
not
as
socrates
and
the
scholastics
fancied
by
obeying
a
foreign
magic
that
matter
sometimes
assumes
or
restores
the
forms
so
precious
in
the
healer
or
the
moralist
eyes
at
the
same
time
the
manner
in
which
the
moral
world
rests
upon
the
natural
though
divined
perhaps
by
a
few
philosophers
has
not
been
generally
understood
and
locke
whose
broad
humanity
could
not
exclude
the
moral
interpretation
of
nature
was
driven
in
the
end
to
the
view
of
socrates
he
seriously
invoked
the
scholastic
maxim
that
nothing
can
produce
that
which
it
does
not
contain
for
this
reason
the
unconscious
after
all
could
never
have
given
rise
to
consciousness
observation
and
experiment
could
not
be
allowed
to
decide
this
point
the
moral
interpretation
of
things
because
more
deeply
rooted
in
human
experience
must
envelop
the
physical
interpretation
and
must
have
the
last
word
it
was
characteristic
of
locke
simplicity
and
intensity
that
he
retained
these
insulated
sympathies
in
various
quarters
a
further
instance
of
his
was
his
fidelity
to
pure
intuition
his
respect
for
the
infallible
revelation
of
ideal
being
such
as
we
have
of
sensible
qualities
or
of
mathematical
relations
in
dreams
and
in
hallucinations
appearances
may
deceive
us
and
the
objects
we
think
we
see
may
not
exist
at
all
yet
in
suffering
an
illusion
we
must
entertain
an
idea
and
the
manifest
character
of
these
ideas
is
that
of
which
alone
locke
thinks
we
can
have
certain
knowledge
these
he
writes
are
two
very
different
things
and
carefully
to
be
distinguished
it
being
one
thing
to
perceive
and
know
the
idea
of
white
or
black
and
quite
another
to
examine
what
kind
of
particles
they
must
be
and
how
arranged
to
make
any
object
appear
white
or
black
a
man
infallibly
knows
as
soon
as
ever
he
has
them
in
his
mind
that
the
ideas
he
calls
white
and
round
are
the
very
ideas
they
are
and
that
they
are
not
other
ideas
which
he
calls
red
or
square
this
the
mind
always
perceives
at
first
sight
and
if
ever
there
happen
any
doubt
about
it
it
will
always
be
found
to
be
about
the
names
and
not
the
ideas
themselves
this
sounds
like
high
platonic
doctrine
for
a
philosopher
of
the
left
but
locke
utilitarian
temper
very
soon
reasserted
itself
in
this
subject
mathematical
ideas
were
not
only
lucid
but
true
and
he
demanded
this
truth
which
he
called
reality
of
all
ideas
worthy
of
consideration
mere
ideas
would
be
worthless
very
likely
he
forgot
in
his
philosophic
puritanism
that
fiction
and
music
might
have
an
intrinsic
charm
where
the
frontier
of
human
wisdom
should
be
drawn
in
this
direction
was
clearly
indicated
in
locke
day
by
spinoza
who
says
if
in
keeping
things
present
to
the
imagination
the
mind
were
at
the
same
time
aware
that
those
things
did
not
exist
surely
it
would
regard
this
gift
of
imagination
as
a
virtue
in
its
own
constitution
not
as
a
vice
especially
if
such
an
imaginative
faculty
depended
on
nothing
except
the
mind
own
nature
that
is
to
say
if
this
mental
faculty
of
imagination
were
free
but
locke
had
not
so
firm
a
hold
on
truth
that
he
could
afford
to
play
with
fancy
and
as
he
pushed
forward
the
claims
of
human
jurisdiction
rather
too
far
in
physics
by
assuming
the
current
science
to
be
literally
true
so
in
the
realm
of
imagination
he
retrenched
somewhat
illiberally
our
legitimate
possessions
strange
that
as
modern
philosophy
transfers
the
visible
wealth
of
nature
more
and
more
to
the
mind
the
mind
should
seem
to
lose
courage
and
to
become
ashamed
of
its
own
fertility
the
natural
man
will
not
indulge
his
imagination
unless
it
poses
for
truth
and
being
half
aware
of
this
imposition
he
is
more
troubled
at
the
thought
of
being
deceived
than
at
the
fact
of
being
mechanised
or
being
bored
and
he
would
wish
to
escape
imagination
altogether
a
good
god
he
murmurs
could
not
have
made
us
poets
against
our
will
against
his
will
however
locke
was
drawn
to
enlarge
the
subjective
sphere
the
actual
existence
of
mind
was
evident
you
had
only
to
notice
the
fact
that
you
were
thinking
conscious
mind
being
thus
known
to
exist
directly
and
independently
of
the
body
was
a
primary
constituent
of
reality
it
was
a
fact
on
its
own
account
common
sense
seemed
to
testify
to
this
not
only
when
confronted
with
the
i
think
therefore
i
am
of
descartes
but
whenever
a
thought
produced
an
action
since
mind
and
body
interacted
each
must
be
as
real
as
the
other
and
as
it
were
on
the
same
plane
of
being
locke
like
a
good
protestant
felt
the
right
of
the
conscious
inner
man
to
assert
himself
and
when
he
looked
into
his
own
mind
he
found
nothing
to
define
this
mind
except
the
ideas
which
occupied
it
the
existence
which
he
was
so
sure
of
in
himself
was
therefore
the
existence
of
his
ideas
here
by
an
insensible
shift
in
the
meaning
of
the
word
idea
a
momentous
revolution
had
taken
place
in
psychology
ideas
had
originally
meant
objective
terms
distinguished
in
qualities
concepts
propositions
but
now
ideas
began
to
mean
living
thoughts
moments
or
states
of
consciousness
they
became
atoms
of
mind
constituents
of
experience
very
much
as
material
atoms
were
conceived
to
be
constituents
of
natural
objects
sensations
became
the
only
objects
of
sensation
and
ideas
the
only
objects
of
ideas
so
that
the
material
world
was
rendered
superfluous
and
the
only
scientific
problem
was
now
to
construct
a
universe
in
terms
of
analytic
psychology
locke
himself
did
not
go
so
far
and
continued
to
assign
physical
causes
and
physical
objects
to
some
at
least
of
his
mental
units
and
indeed
sensations
and
ideas
could
not
very
well
have
other
than
physical
causes
the
existence
of
which
this
new
psychology
was
soon
to
deny
so
that
about
the
origin
of
its
data
it
was
afterwards
compelled
to
preserve
a
discreet
silence
but
as
to
their
combinations
and
reappearances
it
was
able
to
invoke
the
principle
of
association
a
thread
on
which
many
shrewd
observations
may
be
strung
but
which
also
when
pressed
appears
to
be
nothing
but
a
verbal
mask
for
organic
habits
in
matter
the
fact
is
that
there
are
two
sorts
of
unobjectionable
psychology
neither
of
which
describes
a
mechanism
of
disembodied
mental
states
such
as
the
followers
of
locke
developed
into
modern
idealism
to
the
confusion
of
common
sense
one
unobjectionable
sort
of
psychology
is
biological
and
studies
life
from
the
outside
the
other
sort
relying
on
memory
and
dramatic
imagination
reproduces
life
from
the
inside
and
is
literary
if
the
literary
psychologist
is
a
man
of
genius
by
the
clearness
and
range
of
his
memory
by
quickness
of
sympathy
and
power
of
suggestion
he
may
come
very
near
to
the
truth
of
experience
as
it
has
been
or
might
be
unrolled
in
a
human
being
the
ideas
with
which
locke
operates
are
simply
high
lights
picked
out
by
attention
in
this
nebulous
continuum
and
identified
by
names
ideas
in
the
original
ideal
sense
of
the
word
are
indeed
the
only
definite
terms
which
attention
can
discriminate
and
rest
upon
but
the
unity
of
these
units
is
specious
not
existential
if
ideas
were
not
logical
or
aesthetic
essences
but
feelings
each
knowing
itself
they
would
be
insulated
for
ever
no
spirit
could
ever
survey
recognise
or
compare
them
and
mind
would
have
disappeared
in
the
analysis
of
mind
these
considerations
might
enable
us
i
think
to
mark
the
just
frontier
of
common
sense
even
in
this
debatable
land
of
psychology
all
that
is
biological
observable
and
documentary
in
psychology
falls
within
the
lines
of
physical
science
and
offers
no
difficulty
in
principle
nor
need
literary
psychology
form
a
dangerous
salient
in
the
circuit
of
nature
the
dramatic
poet
or
dramatic
historian
necessarily
retains
the
presupposition
of
a
material
world
since
beyond
his
personal
memory
and
even
within
it
he
has
nothing
to
stimulate
and
control
his
dramatic
imagination
save
knowledge
of
the
material
circumstances
in
which
people
live
and
of
the
material
expression
in
action
or
words
which
they
give
to
their
feelings
his
moral
insight
simply
vivifies
the
scene
that
nature
and
the
sciences
of
nature
spread
out
before
him
they
tell
him
what
has
happened
and
his
heart
tells
him
what
has
been
felt
only
literature
can
describe
experience
for
the
excellent
reason
that
the
terms
of
experience
are
moral
and
literary
from
the
beginning
mind
is
incorrigibly
poetical
not
because
it
is
not
attentive
to
material
facts
and
practical
exigencies
but
because
being
intensely
attentive
to
them
it
turns
them
into
pleasures
and
pains
and
into
ideas
yet
at
every
turn
there
is
a
possibility
and
an
occasion
for
transmuting
this
poetry
into
science
because
ideas
and
emotions
being
caused
by
material
events
refer
to
these
events
and
record
their
order
all
philosophies
are
frail
in
that
they
are
products
of
the
human
mind
in
which
everything
is
essentially
reactive
spontaneous
and
volatile
but
as
in
passion
and
in
language
so
in
philosophy
there
are
certain
comparatively
steady
and
hereditary
principles
forming
a
sort
of
orthodox
reason
which
is
or
which
may
become
the
current
grammar
of
mankind
of
philosophers
who
are
orthodox
in
this
sense
only
the
earliest
or
the
most
powerful
an
aristotle
or
a
spinoza
need
to
be
remembered
in
that
they
stamp
their
language
and
temper
upon
human
reason
itself
the
rest
of
the
orthodox
are
justly
lost
in
the
crowd
and
relegated
to
the
chorus
the
frailty
of
heretical
philosophers
is
more
conspicuous
and
interesting
it
makes
up
the
of
the
mind
or
the
history
of
philosophy
locke
belongs
to
both
camps
he
was
restive
in
his
orthodoxy
and
timid
in
his
heresies
and
like
so
many
other
initiators
of
revolutions
he
would
be
dismayed
at
the
result
of
his
work
in
intention
locke
occupied
an
almost
normal
philosophic
position
rendered
precarious
not
by
what
was
traditional
in
it
like
the
categories
of
substance
and
power
but
rather
by
certain
incidental
errors
notably
by
admitting
an
experience
independent
of
bodily
life
yet
compounded
and
evolving
in
a
mechanical
fashion
but
i
do
not
find
in
him
a
prickly
nest
of
obsolete
notions
and
contradictions
from
which
fledged
at
last
we
have
flown
to
our
present
enlightenment
in
his
person
in
his
temper
in
his
allegiances
and
hopes
he
was
the
prototype
of
a
race
of
philosophers
native
and
dominant
among
people
of
english
speech
if
not
in
academic
circles
at
least
in
the
national
mind
if
we
make
allowance
for
a
greater
personal
subtlety
and
for
the
diffidence
and
perplexity
inevitable
in
the
present
moral
anarchy
of
the
world
we
may
find
this
same
lockian
eclecticism
and
prudence
in
the
late
lord
balfour
and
i
have
myself
had
the
advantage
of
being
the
pupil
of
a
gifted
successor
and
in
many
ways
emulator
of
locke
i
mean
william
james
so
great
at
bottom
does
their
spiritual
kinship
seem
to
me
to
be
that
i
can
hardly
conceive
locke
vividly
without
seeing
him
as
a
sort
of
william
james
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
who
of
you
has
not
known
some
other
spontaneous
inquisitive
unsettled
genius
no
less
preoccupied
with
the
marvellous
intelligence
of
some
brazilian
parrot
than
with
the
sad
obstinacy
of
some
bishop
of
worcester
here
is
eternal
freshness
of
conviction
and
ardour
for
reform
great
keenness
of
perception
in
spots
and
in
other
spots
lacunae
and
impulsive
judgments
distrust
of
tradition
of
words
of
constructive
argument
horror
of
vested
interests
and
of
their
smooth
defenders
a
love
of
navigating
alone
and
exploring
for
oneself
even
the
coasts
already
well
charted
by
others
here
is
romanticism
united
with
a
scientific
conscience
and
power
of
destructive
analysis
balanced
by
moral
enthusiasm
doubtless
locke
might
have
dug
his
foundations
deeper
and
integrated
his
faith
better
his
system
was
no
metaphysical
castle
no
theological
acropolis
rather
a
homely
ancestral
manor
house
built
in
several
styles
of
architecture
a
tudor
chapel
a
palladian
front
toward
the
new
geometrical
garden
a
jacobean
parlour
for
political
consultation
and
learned
disputes
and
even
since
we
are
almost
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
chinese
cabinet
full
of
curios
it
was
a
habitable
philosophy
and
not
too
inharmonious
there
was
no
greater
incongruity
in
its
parts
than
in
the
gentle
variations
of
english
weather
or
in
the
qualified
moods
and
insights
of
a
civilised
mind
impoverished
as
we
are
morally
and
humanly
we
can
no
longer
live
in
such
a
rambling
mansion
it
has
become
a
national
monument
on
the
days
when
it
is
open
we
revisit
it
with
admiration
and
those
chambers
and
garden
walks
to
us
the
clear
dogmas
and
savoury
diction
of
the
sage
omnivorous
artless
loquacious
whose
dwelling
it
was

airy

this
monsters
and
changelings
were
pointed
to
by
locke
with
a
certain
controversial
relish
they
proved
that
nature
was
not
compressed
or
compressible
within
aristotelian
genera
and
species
but
was
a
free
mechanism
subject
to
indefinite
change
mechanism
in
physics
is
favourable
to
liberty
in
politics
and
morals
each
creature
has
a
right
to
be
what
it
spontaneously
is
and
not
what
some
previous
classification
alleges
that
it
ought
to
have
been
the
protestant
and
revolutionary
independence
of
locke
mind
here
gives
us
a
foretaste
of
darwin
and
even
of
nietzsche
but
locke
was
moderate
even
in
his
radicalisms
a
human
nature
totally
fluid
would
of
itself
have
proved
anarchical
but
in
order
to
stem
that
natural
anarchy
it
was
fortunately
possible
to
invoke
the
conditions
of
prosperity
and
happiness
strictly
laid
down
by
the
creator
the
improvidence
and
naughtiness
of
nature
was
called
to
book
at
every
turn
by
the
pleasures
and
pains
divinely
appended
to
things
enjoined
and
to
things
forbidden
and
ultimately
by
hell
and
by
heaven
yet
if
rewards
and
punishments
were
attached
to
human
action
and
feeling
in
this
perfectly
external
and
arbitrary
fashion
whilst
the
feelings
and
actions
spontaneous
in
mankind
counted
for
nothing
in
the
rule
of
morals
and
of
wisdom
we
should
be
living
under
the
most
cruel
and
artificial
of
tyrannies
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
the
authority
of
such
a
code
would
be
called
in
question
and
the
reality
of
those
arbitrary
rewards
and
punishments
would
be
denied
both
for
this
world
and
for
any
other
in
a
truly
rational
morality
moral
sanctions
would
have
to
vary
with
the
variation
of
species
each
new
race
or
individual
or
mode
of
feeling
finding
its
natural
joy
in
a
new
way
of
life
the
monsters
would
not
be
monsters
except
to
rustic
prejudice
and
the
changelings
would
be
simply
experiments
in
creation
the
glee
of
locke
in
seeing
nature
elude
scholastic
conventions
would
then
lose
its
savour
since
those
staid
conventions
themselves
would
have
become
obsolete
nature
would
henceforth
present
nothing
but
pervasive
metamorphosis
irresponsible
and
endless
to
correct
the
weariness
of
such
pure
flux
we
might
indeed
invoke
the
idea
of
a
progress
or
evolution
towards
something
always
higher
and
better
but
this
idea
simply
reinstates
under
a
temporal
form
the
dominance
of
a
specific
standard
to
which
nature
is
asked
to
conform
genera
and
species
might
shift
and
glide
into
one
another
at
will
but
always
in
the
authorised
direction
if
on
the
contrary
transformation
had
no
predetermined
direction
we
should
be
driven
back
for
a

very
characteristic
was
the
tireless
polemic
which
locke
carried
on
against
descartes
the
outraged
plain
facts
had
to
be
defended
against
sweeping
and
arbitrary
theories
there
were
no
innate
ideas
or
maxims
children
were
not
born
murmuring
that
things
equal
to
the
same
thing
were
equal
to
one
another
and
an
urchin
knew
that
pain
was
caused
by
the
paternal
slipper
before
he
reflected
philosophically
that
everything
must
have
a
cause
again
extension
was
not
the
essence
of
matter
which
must
be
solid
as
well
to
be
distinguishable
from
empty
space
finally
thinking
was
not
the
essence
of
the
soul
a
man
without
dying
might
lose
consciousness
this
often
happened
or
at
least
could
not
be
prevented
from
happening
by
a
definition
framed
by
a
french
philosopher
these
protests
were
evidently
justified
by
common
sense
yet
they
missed
the
speculative
radicalism
and
depth
of
the
cartesian
doctrines
which
had
struck
the
keynotes
of
all
modern
philosophy
and
science
for
they
assumed
for
the
first
time
in
history
the
transcendental
point
of
view
no
wonder
that
locke
could
not
do
justice
to
this
great
novelty
descartes
himself
did
not
do
so
but
ignored
his
subjective
first
principles
in
the
development
of
his
system
and
it
was
not
until
adopted
by
kant
or
rather
by
fichte
that
the
transcendental
method
showed
its
true
colours
even
today
philosophers
fumble
with
it
patching
soliloquy
with
physics
and
physics
with
soliloquy
moreover
locke
misunderstandings
of
descartes
were
partly
justified
by
the
latter
verbal
concessions
to
tradition
and
authority
a
man
who
has
a
clear
head
and
like
descartes
is
rendered
by
his
aristocratic
pride
both
courteous
and
disdainful
may
readily
conform
to
usage
in
his
language
and
even
in
his
personal
sentiments
without
taking
either
too
seriously
he
is
not
struggling
to
free
his
own
mind
which
is
free
already
nor
very
hopeful
of
freeing
that
of
most
people
the
innate
ideas
were
not
explicit
thoughts
but
categories
employed
unwittingly
as
people
in
speaking
conform
to
the
grammar
of
the
vernacular
without
being
aware
that
they
do
so
as
for
extension
being
the
essence
of
matter
since
matter
existed
and
was
a
substance
it
would
always
have
been
more
than
its
essence
a
sort
of
ether
the
parts
of
which
might
move
and
might
have
different
and
calculable
dynamic
values
the
gist
of
this
definition
of
matter
was
to
clear
the
decks
for
scientific
calculation
by
removing
from
nature
the
moral
density
and
moral
magic
with
which
the
socratic
philosophy
had
encumbered
it
science
would
be
employed
in
describing
the
movements
of
bodies
leaving
it
for
the
senses
and
feelings
to
appreciate
the
that
might
be
generated
in
the
process
though
not
following
the
technique
of
descartes
the
physics
of
our
own
day
realises
his
ideal
and
traces
in
nature
a
mathematical
dynamism
perfectly
sufficient
for
exact
prevision
and
mechanical
art
similarly
in
saying
that
the
essence
of
the
soul
was
to
think
descartes
detached
consciousness
or
actual
spirit
from
the
meshes
of
all
unknown
organic
or
invented
mental
mechanisms
it
was
an
immense
clarification
and
liberation
in
its
proper
dimension
but
this
pure
consciousness
was
not
a
soul
it
was
not
the
animal
psyche
or
principle
of
organisation
life
and
passion
a
principle
which
according
to
descartes
was
material
to
have
called
such
a
material
principle
the
soul
would
have
shocked
all
christian
conceptions
but
if
descartes
had
abstained
from
giving
that
consecrated
name
to
mere
consciousness
he
need
not
have
been
wary
of
making
the
latter
intermittent
and
evanescent
as
it
naturally
is
he
was
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
the
soul
can
never
stop
thinking
by
the
desire
to
placate
orthodox
opinion
and
his
own
christian
sentiments
at
the
expense
of
attributing
to
actual
consciousness
a
substantial
independence
and
a
directive
physical
force
which
were
incongruous
with
it
a
force
and
independence
perfectly
congruous
with
the
platonic
soul
which
had
been
a
mythological
being
a
supernatural
spirit
or
daemon
or
incubus
incarnate
in
the
natural
world
and
partly
dominating
it
the
relations
of
such
a
soul
to
the
particular
body
or
bodies
which
it
might
weave
for
itself
on
earth
to
the
actions
which
it
performed
through
such
bodies
and
to
the
current
of
its
own
thoughts
then
became
questions
for
theology
or
for
a
moralistic
theory
of
the
universe
they
were
questions
remote
from
the
preoccupations
of
the
modern
mind
yet
it
was
not
possible
either
for
locke
or
for
descartes
to
clear
their
fresh
conceptions
altogether
from
those
ancient
dreams
what
views
precisely
did
locke
oppose
to
these
radical
tendencies
of
descartes
in
respect
to
the
nature
of
matter
i
have
indicated
above
the
position
of
locke
pictorially
he
accepted
an
ordinary
atomism
scientifically
the
physics
of
newton
on
the
other
two
points
locke
convictions
were
implicit
rather
than
speculative
he
resisted
the
cartesian
theories
without
much
developing
his
own
as
after
all
was
natural
in
a
critic
engaged
in
proving
that
our
natural
faculties
were
not
intended
for
speculation
all
knowledge
came
from
experience
and
no
man
could
know
the
savour
of
a
pineapple
without
having
tasted
it
yet
this
savour
according
to
locke
did
not
reside
at
first
in
the
pineapple
to
be
conveyed
on
contact
to
the
palate
and
to
the
mind
but
it
was
generated
in
the
process
of
gustation
or
perhaps
we
should
rather
say
that
it
was
generated
in
the
mind
on
occasion
of
that
process
at
least
then
in
respect
to
secondary
qualities
and
to
all
moral
values
the
terms
of
human
knowledge
were
not
drawn
from
the
objects
encountered
in
the
world
but
from
an
innate
sensibility
proper
to
the
human
body
or
mind
experience
if
this
word
meant
the
lifelong
train
of
ideas
which
made
a
man
moral
being
was
not
a
source
of
knowledge
but
was
knowledge
or
illusion
itself
produced
by
organs
endowed
with
a
special
native
sensibility
in
contact
with
varying
external
stimuli
this
conclusion
would
then
not
have
contradicted
but
exactly
expressed
the
doctrine
of
innate
categories
as
to
the
soul
which
might
exist
without
thinking
locke
still
called
it
an
immaterial
substance
not
so
immaterial
however
as
not
to
be
conveyed
bodily
with
him
in
his
coach
from
london
to
oxford
although
like
hobbes
locke
believed
in
the
power
of
the
english
language
to
clarify
the
human
intellect
he
here
ignored
the
advice
of
hobbes
to
turn
that
befuddling
latin
phrase
into
plain
english
substance
meant
body
immaterial
meant
bodiless
therefore
immaterial
substance
meant
bodiless
body
true
substance
had
not
really
meant
body
for
aristotle
or
the
schoolmen
but
who
now
knew
or
cared
what
anything
had
meant
for
them
locke
scornfully
refused
to
consider
what
a
substantial
form
may
have
signified
and
in
still
maintaining
that
he
had
a
soul
and
calling
it
a
spiritual
substance
he
was
probably
simply
protesting
that
there
was
something
living
and
watchful
within
his
breast
the
invisible
moral
agent
in
all
his
thoughts
and
actions
it
was
that
had
them
and
did
them
and
this
self
of
his
was
far
from
being
reducible
to
a
merely
logical
impersonal
subject
an
i
think
presupposed
in
all
thought
for
what
would
this
i
think
have
become
when
it
was
not
thinking
on
the
other
hand
it
mattered
very
little
what
the
of
a
thinking
being
might
be
god
might
even
have
endowed
the
body
with
the
faculty
of
thinking
and
of
generating
ideas
on
occasion
of
certain
impacts
yet
a
man
was
a
man
for
all
that
and
locke
was
satisfied
that
he
knew
at
least
well
enough
for
an
honest
englishman
what
he
was
he
was
what
he
felt
himself
to
be
and
this
inner
man
of
his
was
not
merely
the
living
self
throbbing
now
in
his
heart
it
was
all
his
moral
past
all
that
he
remembered
to
have
been
if
from
moment
to
moment
the
self
was
a
spiritual
energy
astir
within
in
retrospect
the
living
present
seemed
as
it
were
to
extend
its
tentacles
and
to
communicate
its
subjectivity
to
his
whole
personal
past
the
limits
of
his
personality
were
those
of
his
memory
and
his
experience
included
everything
that
his
living
mind
could
appropriate
and
in
a
word
was
his
idea
of
and
this
insight
opens
a
new
chapter
not
only
in
his
philosophy
but
in
the
history
of
human
mankind
was
henceforth
invited
not
to
think
of
itself
as
a
tribe
of
natural
beings
nor
of
souls
with
a
specific
nature
and
fixed
possibilities
each
man
was
a
romantic
personage
or
literary
character
he
was
simply
what
he
was
thought
to
be
and
might
become
anything

he
could

into

animal
soul
as
aristotle
says
from
beyond
the
gates
comes
and
is
called
down
by
the
exigencies
of
physical
life
an
animal
endowed
with
locomotion
can
not
merely
feast
sensuously
on
things
as
they
appear
but
must
react
upon
them
at
the
first
signal
and
in
so
doing
must
virtually
and
in
intent
envisage
them
as
they
are
in
themselves
for
it
is
by
virtue
of
their
real
constitution
and
intrinsic
energy
that
they
act
upon
us
and
suffer
change
in
turn
at
our
hands
so
that
whatsoever
form
things
may
take
to
our
senses
and
intellect
they
take
that
form
by
exerting
their
material
powers
upon
us
and
intertwining
them
in
action
with
our
own
organisms
thus
the
appearance
of
things
is
always
in
some
measure
a
true
index
to
their
reality
animals
are
inevitably
engaged
in
action
and
the
consciousness
of
action
is
knowledge
the
very
nature
of
animal
life
makes
it
possible
within
animal
consciousness
to
discount
appearance
and
to
correct
illusion
things
which
in
a
vegetative
or
aesthetic
sensibility
would
not
be
distinguishable
from
pure
experience
itself
but
when
aroused
to
attention
feeling
must
needs
rise
to
intelligence

dramatically
these

and
the
source
of

is
this
psychic
power
then
resident
in
the
body
undoubtedly
since
it
is
hereditary
and
transmitted
by
a
seed
and
continually
aroused

modified
by
material
agencies
since
this
soul

so
obscure
the
temptation
is
great
to
dramatise
its
energies

to
describe

of

which

we
should

soft
and
so
violent
which
breeds
our
sensations
and
precipitates
our
actions
we
see
today
how
the
freudian
psychology
just
because
it
is
not
satisfied
with
registering
the
routine
of
consciousness
but
endeavours
to
trace
its
hidden
mechanism
and
to
unravel
its
physical
causes
is
driven
to
use
the
most
frankly
mythological
language
the
physiological
processes
concerned
though
presupposed
are
not
on
the
scale
of
human
perception
and
not
traceable
in
detail
and
the
moral
action
though
familiar
in
snatches
has
to
be
patched
by
invented
episodes
and
largely
attributed
to
daemonic
personages
that
never
come
on
the
stage
locke
in
his
psychology
of
morals
had
at
first
followed
the
verbal
rationalism
by
which
people
attribute
motives
to
themselves
and
to
one
another
human
actions
were
explained
by
the
alleged
pursuit
of
the
greater
prospective
pleasure
and
avoidance
of
the
greater
prospective
pain
but
this
way
of
talking
though
not
so
poetical
as
freud
is
no
less
mythical
eventual
goods
and
evils
have
no
present
existence
and
no
power
they
can
not
even
be
discerned
prophetically
save
by
the
vaguest
fancy
entirely
based
on
the
present
impulses
and
obsessions
of
the
soul
no
future
good
no
future
evil
avails
to
move
us
except
as
locke
said
after
examining
the
facts
more
closely
when
a
in
the
soul
or
in
the
body
causes
us
to
turn
to
those
untried
goods
and
evils
with
a
present
and
living
interest
this
actual
uneasiness
with
the
dream
pictures
which
it
evokes
is
a
mere
symptom
of
the
direction
in
which
human
nature
in
us
is
already
moving
or
already
disposed
to
move
without
this
prior
physical
impulse
heaven
may
beckon
and
hell
may
yawn
without
causing
the
least
variation
in
conduct
as
in
religious
conversion
all
is
due
to
the
call
of
grace
so
in
ordinary
action
all
is
due
to
the
ripening
of
natural
impulses
and
powers
within
the
psyche
the
observed
by
locke
is
merely
the
consciousness
of
this
ripening
before
the
field
of
relevant
action
has
been
clearly
discerned
when
all
this
is
considered
the
ostensible
interaction
between
mind
and
body
puts
on
a
new
aspect
there
are
no
ideas
or
intentions
followed
by
material
effects
there
are
no
material
events
followed
by
a
sensation
or
idea
mental
events
are
always
elements
in
total
natural
events
containing
material

also
material

form
the
organ
the
stimulus
and
probably
also
the
object
for
those
mental

moreover
the
physical
strand
alone
is
found
to
be
continuous
and
traceable
the
conscious
strand
the
sequence
of
mental
events
flares
up
and
dies
down
daily
if
not
hourly
and
the
medley
of
its
immediate
features

juxtaposes
china
and
peru
past

in
the
most
irresponsible
confusion
on
the
other
hand
in
human
life
it
is
a
part
of
the
conscious
element

and
reasonings
that
the

an

as
it
were

posthumously
as
they
are
general
overarching
moral
inspirations

which
the

of

executes
in

rendering
our

more
precise
in

totally
transforming

we
do
roughly
what
we
meant
to
do
barring
accidents
the
reasons
lie
deep
in
our
compound
nature
being
probably
inarticulate
and
our

in
a
fragmentary
way
betrays
our
moral

whether

call
such
cohabitation

the
confusion
of
common
berkeley
and
his
followers
sometimes
maintain
that
common
sense
is
on
their
side
that
they
have
simply
analysed
the
fact
of
our
experience
of
the
material
world
and
if
there
is
any
paradox
in
their
idealism
it
is
merely
verbal
and
disappears
with
familiarity
all
the
reality
they
say
all
the
force
obduracy
and
fertility
of
nature
subsist
undiminished
after
we
discover
that
this
reality
resides
and
can
only
reside
in
the
fixed
order
of
our
experience
but
no
analysis
of
immediate
experience
will
never
disclose
any
fixed
order
in
it
the
surface
of
experience
when
not
interpreted
materialistically
is
an
inextricable
dream
berkeley
and
his
followers
when
they
look
in
this
direction
towards
nature
and
the
rationale
of
experience
and
science
are
looking
away
from
their
own
system
and
relying
instead
on
the
automatic
propensity
of
human
nature
to
routine
so
that
we
spontaneously
prepare
for
repeating
our
actions
not
our
experience
and
even
anticipate
their
occasions
a
propensity
further
biased
by
the
dominant
rhythms
of
the
psyche
so
that
we
assume
a
future
not
so
much
similar
to
the
past
as
better
when
developed
this
propensity
turns
into
trust
in
natural
or
divine
laws
but
it
is
contrary
to
common
sense
to
expect
such
laws
to
operate
apart
from
matter
and
from
the
material
continuity
of
external
occasions
this
appears
clearly
in
our
trust
in
persons
a
radical
animal
propensity
which
is
consonant
with
common
sense
when
these
persons
are
living
bodies
but
becomes
superstitious
or
at
least
highly
speculative
when
these
persons
are
disembodied
spirits
it
is
a
pity
that
the
beautiful
system
of
berkeley
should
have
appeared
in
an
unspiritual
age
when
religion
was
mundane
and
perfunctory
and
the
free
spirit
where
it
stirred
was
romantic
and
wilful
for
that
system
was
essentially
religious
it
put
the
spirit
face
to
face
with
god
everywhere
always
and
in
everything
it
turned
experience
into
a
divine
language
for
the
monition
and
expression
of
the
inner
man
such
an
instrument
in
spiritual
hands
might
have
served
to
dispel
all
natural
illusions
and
affections
and
to
disinfect
the
spirit
of
worldliness
and
egotism
but
berkeley
and
his
followers
had
no
such
thought
all
they
wished
was
to
substitute
a
social
for
a
material
world
precisely
because
a
merely
social
world
might
make
worldly
interests
loom
larger
and
might
induce
mankind
against
the
evidence
of
their
senses
and
the
still
small
voice
in
their
hearts
to
live
as
if
their
worldly
interests
were
absolute
and
must
needs
dominate
the
spirit
morally
this
system
thus
came
to
sanction
a
human
servitude
to
material
things
such
as
ancient
materialists
would
have
scorned
and
theoretically
the
system
did
not
escape
the
dogmatic
commitments
of
common
sense
against
which
it
protested
for
far
from
withdrawing
into
the
depths
of
the
private
spirit
it
professed
to
describe
universal
experience
and
the
evolution
of
all
human
ideas
this
notion
of
experience
originally
presupposed
a
natural
agent
or
subject
to
endure
that
experience
and
to
profit
by
it
by
learning
to
live
in
better
harmony
with
external
circumstances
each
agent
or
subject
of
experience
might
at
other
times
become
an
object
of
experience
also
for
they
all
formed
part
of
a
material
world
which
they
might
envisage
in
common
in
their
perceptions
now
the
criticism
which
repudiates
this
common
material
medium
like
all
criticism
or
doubt
is
secondary
and
partial
it
continues
to
operate
with
all
the
assumptions
of
common
sense
save
the
one
which
it
is
expressly
criticising
so
in
repudiating
the
material
world
this
philosophy
retains
the
notion
of
various
agents
or
subjects
gathering
experience
and
we
are
not
expected
to
doubt
that
there
are
just
as
many
streams
of
experience
without
a
world
as
there
were
people
in
the
world
when
the
world
existed
but
the
number
and
nature
of
these
experiences
have
now
become
undiscoverable
the
material
persons
having
been
removed
who
formerly
were
so
placed
as
to
gather
easily
imagined
experiences
and
to
be
able
to
communicate
them
and
the
very
notion
of
experience
has
been
emptied
of
its
meaning
when
no
external
common
world
subsists
to
impose
that
same
experience
on
everybody
it
was
not
knowledge
of
existing
experiences
that
led
common
sense
to
assume
a
material
world
but
knowledge
of
an
existing
material
world
led
it
to
assume
existing
and
regularly
reproducible
experiences
thus
the
whole
social
convention
posited
by
empirical
idealism
is
borrowed
without
leave
and
rests
on
the
belief
in
nature
for
which
it
is
substituted

the
truth
of

not

an
object
of

because
it
is
essentially
invisible
immeasurable
fugitive
and
private
and
although
it
may
be

the

imagination
can

it
may
be
guided
and
perhaps
recast
by
fresh

quite
incommensurable
ideas
yet
under
favourable
circumstances
such
suggestion

revelation
of

without

may
become

may
produce

as

fifty
years
of
british
idealism
after
fifty
years
an
old
milestone
in
the
path
of
philosophy
has
been
set
up
again
as
if
to
mark
the
distance
which
english
opinion
has
traversed
in
the
interval
it
has
passed
from
insular
dogmatism
to
universal
bewilderment
and
a
chief
agent
in
the
change
has
been
bradley
himself
with
his
scornful
and
delicate
intellect
his
wit
his
candour
his
persistence
and
the
baffling
futility
of
his
conclusions
in
this
early
book
we
see
him
coming
forth
like
a
young
david
against
every
clumsy
champion
of
utilitarianism
hedonism
positivism
or
empiricism
and
how
smooth
and
polished
were
the
little
stones
in
his
sling
how
fatally
they
would
have
lodged
in
the
forehead
of
that
composite
monster
if
only
it
had
had
a
forehead
some
of
them
might
even
have
done
murderous
execution
in
bradley
own
camp
for
instance
this
pebble
cast
playfully
at
the
metaphysical
idol
called
law
it
is
wet
on
because
of
the
law
of
raininess
but
it
is
wet
because
of
the
supplementary
law
of
sunshine
bradley
and
his
friends
achieved
a
notable
victory
in
the
academic
field
philosophic
authority
and
influence
passed
largely
into
their
hands
in
all
universities
but
it
was
not
exactly
from
these
seats
of
learning
that
naturalism
and
utilitarianism
needed
to
be
dislodged
like
the
corresponding
radicalisms
of
our
day
these
doctrines
prevailed
rather
in
certain
political
and
intellectual
circles
outside
consciously
revolutionary
and
often
and
i
am
afraid
that
the
braggart
goliaths
of
today
need
chastening
at
least
as
much
as
those
of
fifty
years
ago
in
a
country
officially
christian
and
especially
in
oxford
it
is
natural
and
fitting
that
academic
authority
should
belong
to
orthodox
tradition
theological
platonic
and
aristotelian
bradley
save
for
a
few
learned
quotations
strangely
ignored
this
orthodoxy
entrenched
behind
his
back
in
contrast
with
it
he
was
himself
a
heretic
with
first
principles
devastating
every
settled
belief
and
it
was
really
this
venerable
silent
partner
at
home
that
his
victory
superseded
at
least
in
appearance
and
for
a
season
david
did
not
slay
goliath
but
he
dethroned
saul
saul
was
indeed
already
under
a
cloud
and
all
in
david
heart
was
not
unkindness
in
that
direction
bradley
might
almost
be
called
an
unbelieving
newman
time
especially
seems
to
have
brought
his
suffering
and
refined
spirit
into
greater
sympathy
with
ancient
sanctities
originally
for
instance
venting
the
hearty
protestant
sentiment
that
only
the
christianity
of
laymen
is
sound
he
had
written
i
am
happy
to
say
that
has
no
english
equivalent
but
a
later
note
says
this
is
not
true
except
of
modern
english
only
and
in
any
case
it
wo
do
and
was
wrong
and
due
to
ignorance
however
secluded
the
religious
life
it
may
be
practical
indirectly
through
the
unity
of
the
spiritual
body
it
can
be
taken
as
vicarious
the
here
saves
the
principle
that
all
values
must
be
social
and
that
the
social
organism
is
the
sole
moral
reality
yet
how
near
this
bubble
comes
to
being
pricked
we
seem
clearly
to
feel
that
the
question
is
not
whether
spiritual
life
subserves
animal
society
but
whether
animal
society
ever
is
stirred
and
hallowed
into
spiritual
life
all
this
however
in
that
age
of
progress
was
regarded
as
obsolete
there
was
no
longer
to
be
any
spirit
except
the
spirit
of
the
times
true
the
ritualists
might
be
striving
to
revive
the
latent
energies
of
religious
devotion
with
some
dubious
help
from
aestheticism
but
against
the
rising
tide
of
mechanical
progress
and
romantic
anarchy
and
against
the
mania
for
rewriting
history
traditional
philosophy
then
seemed
helpless
and
afraid
to
defend
itself
it
is
only
now
beginning
to
recover
its
intellectual
courage
for
the
moment
speculative
radicals
saw
light
in
a
different
quarter
german
idealism
was
nothing
if
not
it
was
relatively
new
it
was
encyclopaedic
in
its
display
of
knowledge
which
it
could
manipulate
dialectically
with
dazzling
if
not
stable
results
it
was
protestant
in
temper
and
autonomous
in
principle
and
altogether
it
seemed
a
sovereign
and
providential
means
of
suddenly
turning
the
tables
on
the
threatened
naturalism
by
developing
romantic
intuition
from
within
and
packing
all
knowledge
into
one
picture
the
universe
might
be
shown
to
be
like
intuition
itself
thoroughly
spiritual
personal
and
subjective
the
fundamental
axiom
of
the
new
logic
was
that
the
only
possible
reality
was
consciousness
people
find
writes
bradley
a
subject
and
an
object
correlated
in
consciousness
to
go
out
of
that
unity
is
for
us
literally
to
go
out
of
our
minds
when
mind
is
made
only
a
part
of
the
whole
there
is
a
question
which
be
answered
if
about
any
matter
we
know
nothing
whatsoever
can
we
say
anything
about
it
can
we
even
say
that
it
is
and
if
it
is
not
in
consciousness
how
can
we
know
it
and
conversely
if
we
know
it
it
can
not
be
not
mind
bradley
challenged
his
contemporaries
to
refute
this
argument
and
not
being
able
to
do
so
many
of
them
felt
constrained
to
accept
it
perhaps
not
without
grave
misgivings
for
was
it
not
always
a
rooted
conviction
of
the
british
mind
that
knowledge
brings
material
power
and
that
any
figments
of
consciousness
in
religion
for
instance
not
bringing
material
power
are
dangerous
bewitchments
and
not
properly
knowledge
yet
it
is
no
less
characteristic
of
the
british
mind
to
yield
occasionally
up
to
a
certain
point
to
some
such
enthusiastic
fancy
provided
that
its
incompatibility
with
honest
action
may
be
denied
or
ignored
so
in
this
case
british
idealists
in
the
act
of
defining
knowledge
idealistically
as
the
presence
to
consciousness
of
its
own
phenomena
never
really
ceased
to
assume
transcendent
knowledge
of
a
world
social
and
psychological
if
not
material
and
they
continued
scrupulously
to
readjust
their
ideas
to
those
dark
facts
often
more
faithfully
than
the
avowed
positivists
or
scientific
psychologists
what
could
ethics
properly
be
to
a
philosopher
who
on
principle
might
not
trespass
beyond
the
limits
of
consciousness
only
ethical
sentiment
bradley
was
satisfied
to
appeal
to
the
moral
consciousness
of
his
day
without
seeking
to
transform
it
the
most
intentionally
eloquent
passage
in
his
book
describes
unifying
and
carrying
away
a
whole
people
that
was
the
summit
of
moral
consciousness
and
of
mystic
virtue
his
aim
even
in
ethics
was
avowedly
to
describe
that
which
exists
to
describe
moral
experience
without
proposing
a
different
form
for
it
a
man
must
be
a
man
of
his
own
time
or
nothing
to
set
up
to
be
better
than
the
world
was
the
beginning
of
immorality
and
virtue
lay
in
accepting
one
station
and
its
duties
the
moralist
should
fill
his
mind
with
a
concrete
picture
of
the
task
and
standards
of
his
age
and
nation
and
should
graft
his
own
ideals
upon
that
tree
this
need
not
prevent
moral
consciousness
from
including
a
decided
esteem
for
excellences
like
health
beauty
or
intelligence
which
are
not
ordinarily
called
virtues
by
modern
moralists
yet
they
were
undeniably
good
better
perhaps
than
any
painful
and
laborious
dutifulness
so
that
the
strictly
moral
consciousness
might
run
over
and
presently
lose
itself
in
something
higher
indeed
even
health
beauty
and
intelligence
which
seemed
at
first
so
clearly
good
might
lose
their
sharpness
on
a
wider
view
in
the
panorama
that
would
ultimately
fill
the
mind
these
goods
and
virtues
could
not
be
conceived
without
their
complementary
vices
and
evils
thus
all
moral
consciousness
and
even
all
vital
preference
might
ultimately
be
superseded
they
might
appear
to
have
belonged
to
a
partial
and
rather
low
stage
in
the
of
consciousness
with
this
dissolution
of
his
moral
judgments
always
in
prospect
why
should
bradley
or
any
idealist
have
pursued
ethical
studies
at
all
since
all
phases
of
life
were
equally
necessary
to
enrich
an
infinite
consciousness
which
must
know
both
good
and
evil
in
order
to
merge
and
to
transcend
them
he
could
hardly
nurse
any
intense
enthusiasm
for
a
different
complexion
to
be
given
to
the
lives
of
men
his
moral
passion
for
he
had
it
caustic
and
burning
clear
was
purely
intellectual
it
was
shame
that
in
england
the
moral
consciousness
should
have
been
expressed
in
systems
dialectically
so
primitive
as
those
of
the
positivists
and
utilitarians
he
acknowledged
somewhat
superciliously
that
their
hearts
were
in
the
right
place
yet
if
we
are
to
have
ethics
at
all
were
not
their
thoughts
in
the
right
place
also
they
were
concerned
not
with
analysis
of
the
moral
consciousness
but
with
the
conduct
of
affairs
and
the
reform
of
institutions
the
spectacle
of
human
wretchedness
profoundly
moved
them
their
minds
were
bent
on
transforming
society
so
that
a
man
station
and
its
duties
might
cease
to
be
what
a
decayed
feudal
organisation
and
an
inhuman
industrialism
had
made
of
them
they
revolted
against
the
miserable
condition
of
the
masses
of
mankind
and
against
the
miserable
consolations
which
official
religion
or
a
philosophy
like
bradley
offered
them
in
their
misery
the
utilitarians
were
at
least
intent
on
existence
and
on
the
course
of
events
they
wished
to
transform
institutions
to
fit
human
nature
better
and
to
educate
human
nature
by
those
new
institutions
so
that
it
might
better
realise
its
latent
capacities
these
are
matters
which
a
man
may
modify
by
his
acts
and
they
are
therefore
the
proper
concern
of
the
moralist
were
they
much
to
blame
if
they
neglected
to
define
pleasure
or
happiness
and
used
dialectically
vague
to
indicate
a
direction
of
effort
politically
quite
unmistakable
doubtless
their
political
action
like
their
philosophical
nomenclature
was
revolutionary
and
relied
too
much
on
wayward
feelings
ignorant
of
their
own
causes
revolution
no
less
than
tradition
is
but
a
casual
and
clumsy
expression
of
human
nature
in
contact
with
circumstances
yet
pain
and
pleasure
and
spontaneous
hopes
however
foolish
are
direct
expressions
of
that
contact
and
speak
for
the
soul
whereas
a
man
station
and
its
duties
are
purely
conventional
and
may
altogether
misrepresent
his
native
capacities
the
protest
of
human
nature
against
the
world
and
its
oppressions
is
the
strong
side
of
every
rebellion
it
was
the
side
of
utilitarianism
of
the
rebellion
against
irrational
morality
unfortunately
the
english
reformers
were
themselves
idealists
of
a
sort
entangled
in
the
vehicles
of
perception
and
talking
about
sensations
and
ideas
pleasures
and
pains
as
if
these
had
been
the
elements
of
human
nature
or
even
of
nature
at
large
and
only
the
most
meagre
of
verbal
systems
and
the
most
artificial
can
be
constructed
out
of
such
materials
moreover
they
spoke
much
of
pleasure
and
happiness
and
hardly
at
all
of
misery
and
pain
whereas
it
would
have
been
wiser
and
truer
to
their
real
inspiration
to
have
laid
all
the
emphasis
on
evils
to
be
abated
leaving
the
good
to
shape
itself
in
freedom
suffering
is
the
instant
and
obvious
sign
of
some
outrage
done
to
human
nature
without
this
natural
recoil
actual
or
imminent
no
morality
would
have
any
sanction
and
no
precept
could
be
imperative
what
silliness
to
command
me
to
pursue
pleasure
or
to
avoid
it
if
in
any
case
everything
would
be
well
save
for
some
shadow
of
dire
repentance
looming
in
the
distance
i
am
deeply
free
to
walk
as
i
will
the
choice
of
pleasure
for
a
principle
of
morals
was
particularly
unfortunate
in
the
british
utilitarians
it
lent
them
an
air
of
frivolity
absurdly
contrary
to
their
true
character
pleasure
might
have
been
a
fit
enough
word
in
the
mouth
of
aristippus
a
untouched
by
the
least
sense
of
responsibility
or
even
on
the
lips
of
humanists
in
the
eighteenth
century
who
however
sordid
their
lives
may
sometimes
have
been
could
still
move
in
imagination
to
the
music
of
mozart
in
the
landscape
of
watteau
or
of
fragonard
but
in
the
land
and
age
of
dickens
the
moral
ideal
was
not
so
much
pleasure
as
kindness
this
tenderer
word
not
only
expresses
better
the
motive
at
work
but
it
points
to
the
distressing
presence
of
misery
in
the
world
to
make
natural
kindness
laborious
and
earnest
and
turn
it
into
a
legislative
system
bradley
hostility
to
pleasure
was
not
fanatical
one
station
and
its
duties
might
have
their
agreeable
side
it
is
probably
good
for
you
he
tells
us
to
have
say
not
less
than
two
glasses
of
wine
after
dinner
six
on
ordinary
occasions
is
perhaps
too
many
but
as
to
three
or
four
they
are
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
if
the
voluptuary
was
condemned
it
was
for
the
commonplace
reason
which
a
hedonist
too
might
invoke
that
a
life
of
pleasure
soon
palls
and
becomes
unpleasant
objection
to
pleasure
was
merely
speculative
he
found
it
too
abstract
to
call
a
pleasure
when
actually
felt
an
abstraction
is
an
exquisite
absurdity
but
pleasure
in
its
absolute
essence
is
certainly
simple
and
indefinable
if
instead
of
enjoying
it
on
the
wing
and
as
an
earnest
of
the
soul
momentary
harmony
we
attempt
to
arrest
and
observe
it
we
find
it
strangely
dumb
we
are
not
informed
by
it
concerning
its
occasion
nor
carried
from
it
by
any
logical
implication
to
the
natural
object
in
which
it
might
be
found
a
pure
hedonist
ought
therefore
to
be
rather
relieved
if
all
images
lapsed
from
his
consciousness
and
he
could
luxuriate
in
sheer
pleasure
dark
and
overwhelming
true
such
bliss
would
be
rather
inhuman
and
of
the
sort
which
we
rashly
assign
to
the
oyster
but
why
should
a
radical
and
intrepid
philosopher
be
ashamed
of
that
the
condition
of
bradley
absolute
feeling
in
which
all
distinctions
are
transcended
and
merged
seems
to
be
something
of
that
kind
but
there
would
be
a
strange
irony
in
attributing
this
mystical
and
rapturous
ideal
to
such
ponderous
worthies
as
mill
and
spencer
whose
minds
were
nothing
if
not
anxious
perturbed
instrumental
and
full
of
respect
for
variegated
facts
and
who
were
probably
incapable
of
tasting
pure
pleasure
at
all
but
if
pleasure
in
its
pure
essence
might
really
be
the
highest
good
for
a
mystic
who
should
be
lost
in
it
it
would
be
no
guide
to
a
moralist
wishing
to
control
events
and
to
distribute
particular
pleasures
or
series
of
pleasures
as
richly
as
possible
in
the
world
for
this
purpose
he
would
need
to
understand
human
nature
and
its
variable
functions
in
which
different
persons
and
peoples
may
find
their
sincere
pleasures
and
this
knowledge
would
first
lend
to
his
general
love
of
pleasure
any
point
of
application
in
the
governance
of
life
or
in
benevolent
legislation
some
concrete
image
of
a
happy
human
world
would
take
the
place
of
the
futile
truism
that
pleasure
is
good
and
pain
evil
this
is
of
course
what
utilitarian
moralists
meant
to
do
and
actually
did
in
so
far
as
their
human
sympathies
extended
which
was
not
to
the
highest
things
but
it
was
not
what
they
said
and
bradley
had
a
clear
advantage
over
them
in
the
war
of
words
a
pleasure
is
not
a
programme
it
exists
here
and
not
there
for
me
and
for
no
one
else
once
and
never
again
when
past
it
leaves
the
will
as
empty
and
as
devoid
of
allegiance
as
if
it
had
never
existed
pleasure
is
sand
though
it
have
the
colour
of
gold
but
this
is
evidently
true
of
all
existence
each
living
moment
each
dead
man
each
cycle
of
the
universe
leaves
nothing
behind
it
but
a
void
which
perhaps
something
kindred
may
refill
a
hegel
after
identifying
himself
for
a
moment
with
the
absolute
idea
is
in
his
existence
no
less
subject
to
sleepiness
irritation
and
death
than
if
he
had
been
modestly
satisfied
with
the
joys
of
an
oyster
it
is
only
their
common
form
or
their
common
worship
that
can
give
to
the
quick
moments
of
life
any
mutual
relevance
or
sympathy
and
existence
would
not
come
at
all
within
sight
of
a
good
either
momentary
or
final
if
it
were
not
inwardly
directed
upon
realising
some
definite
essence
for
the
rest
this
essence
may
be
as
simple
as
you
will
if
the
nature
directed
upon
it
is
unified
and
simple
and
it
would
be
mere
intellectual
snobbery
to
condemn
pleasure
because
it
has
not
so
many
subdivisions
in
it
as
an
encyclopaedia
of
the
sciences
for
the
moralist
pleasure
and
pain
may
even
be
the
better
guides
because
they
express
more
directly
and
boldly
the
instinctive
direction
of
animal
life
and
thereby
mark
more
clearly
the
genuine
difference
between
good
and
evil
we
may
well
say
with
bradley
that
the
good
is
but
what
is
the
self
certainly
not
the
feeling
or
consciousness
of
the
moment
nor
the
life
of
the
world
nor
pure
spirit
the
self
that
can
systematically
distinguish
good
from
evil
is
an
animal
soul
it
grows
from
a
seed
its
potentiality
is
definite
and
its
fate
precarious
and
in
man
it
requires
society
to
rear
it
and
tradition
to
educate
it
the
good
is
accordingly
social
in
so
far
as
the
soul
demands
society
but
it
is
the
nature
of
the
individual
that
determines
the
kind
and
degree
of
sociability
that
is
good
for
him
and
draws
the
line
between
society
that
is
a
benefit
and
society
that
is
a
nuisance
to
subordinate
the
soul
fundamentally
to
society
or
the
individual
to
the
state
is
sheer
barbarism
the
greeks
sometimes
invoked
to
support
this
form
of
idolatry
were
never
guilty
of
it
on
the
contrary
their
lawgivers
were
always
reforming
and
planning
the
state
so
that
the
soul
might
be
perfect
in
it
discipline
is
a
help
to
the
spirit
but
even
social
relations
when
like
love
friendship
or
sport
they
are
spontaneous
and
good
in
themselves
retire
as
far
as
possible
from
the
pressure
of
the
world
and
build
their
paradise
apart
simple
and
hidden
in
the
wilderness
while
all
the
ultimate
hopes
and
assurances
of
the
spirit
escape
altogether
into
the
silent
society
of
nature
of
truth
of
essence
far
from
those
fatuous
worldly
conventions
which
hardly
make
up
for
their
tyranny
by
their
instability
for
the
prevalent
moral
fashion
is
always
growing
old
and
human
nature
is
always
becoming
young
again
is
the
expedient
of
those
who
having
lost
the
soul
that
is
in
them
look
for
it
in
things
external
where
there
is
no
soul
and
by
a
curious
recoil
it
is
also
the
expedient
of
those
who
seek
their
lost
soul
in
actual
consciousness
where
it
also
is
not
for
sensations
and
ideas
are
not
the
soul
but
only
passing
and
partial
products
of
its
profound
animal
life
moral
consciousness
in
particular
would
never
have
arisen
and
would
be
gratuitous
save
for
the
ferocious
bias
of
a
natural
living
creature
defending
itself
against
its
thousand
enemies
nor
would
knowledge
in
its
turn
be
knowledge
if
it
were
merely
intuition
of
essence
such
as
the
sensualist
the
poet
or
the
dialectician
may
rest
in
if
the
imagery
of
logic
or
passion
ever
comes
to
convey
it
does
so
by
virtue
of
a
concomitant
physical
adjustment
to
external
things
for
the
nerve
of
real
or
transcendent
knowledge
is
the
notice
which
one
part
of
the
world
may
take
of
another
part
and
it
is
this
momentous
cognisance
no
matter
what
intangible
feelings
may
supply
terms
for
its
prosody
that
enlarges
the
mind
to
some
practical
purpose
and
informs
it
about
the
world
consciousness
then
ceases
to
be
passive
sense
or
idle
ideation
and
becomes
belief
and
intelligence
then
the
essences
which
form
the
content
of
consciousness
may
be
vivified
and
trippingly
run
over
like
the
syllables
of
a
familiar
word
in
the
active
recognition
of
things
and
people
and
of
all
the
ominous
or
pliable
forces
of
nature
for
essences
being
eternal
and
in
themselves
can
not
come
to
consciousness
by
their
own
initiative
but
only
as
occasion
and
the
subtle
movements
of
the
soul
may
evoke
their
forms
so
that
the
fact
that
they
are
given
to
consciousness
has
a
natural
status
and
setting
in
the
material
world
and
is
part
of
the
same
natural
event
as
the
movement
of
the
soul
and
body
which
supports
that
consciousness
there
is
therefore
no
need
of
refuting
idealism
which
is
an
honest
examination
of
conscience
in
a
reflective
mind
refutations
and
proofs
depend
on
pregnant
meanings
assigned
to
terms
meanings
first
rendered
explicit
and
unambiguous
by
those
very
proofs
or
refutations
on
any
different
acceptation
of
those
terms
these
proofs
and
refutations
fall
to
the
ground
and
it
remains
a
question
for
good
sense
not
for
logic
at
all
how
far
the
terms
in
either
case
describe
anything
existent
if
by
knowledge
we
understand
intuition
of
essences
idealism
follows
but
it
follows
only
in
respect
to
essences
given
in
intuition
nothing
follows
concerning
the
seat
origin
conditions
or
symptomatic
value
of
such
intuition
nor
even
that
such
intuition
ever
actually
occurs
idealism
therefore
without
being
refuted
may
be
hemmed
in
and
humanised
by
natural
knowledge
about
it
and
about
its
place
in
human
speculation
the
most
recalcitrant
materialist
like
myself
might
see
its
plausibility
during
a
somewhat
adolescent
phase
of
consciousness
itself
he
might
accept
and
relish
as
the
natural
spiritual
resonance
of
action
and
passion
recognising
it
in
its
proud
isolation
and
specious
autonomy
like
the
mountain
republics
of
andorra
and
san
marino
german
idealism
is
a
mighty
pose
an
attitude
always
possible
to
a
and
reflective
being
but
it
is
hardly
a
system
since
it
contradicts
beliefs
which
in
action
are
inevitable
it
may
therefore
be
readily
swallowed
but
it
can
never
be
digested
neither
of
its
two
ingredients
romantic
scepticism
and
romantic
superstition
agrees
particularly
with
the
british
stomach
not
romantic
scepticism
for
in
england
an
instinctive
distrust
of
too
much
clearness
and
logic
a
difficulty
in
drawing
all
the
consequences
of
any
principle
soon
gave
to
this
most
radical
of
philosophies
a
prim
and
religious
air
its
purity
was
alloyed
with
all
sorts
of
conventions
so
much
so
that
we
find
british
hegelians
often
deeply
engaged
in
psychology
cosmology
or
religion
as
if
they
took
their
idealism
for
a
kind
of
physics
and
wished
merely
to
reinterpret
the
facts
of
nature
in
an
edifying
way
without
uprooting
them
from
their
natural
places
this
has
been
made
easier
by
giving
idealism
an
objective
turn
events
and
especially
feelings
and
ideas
will
then
be
swallowed
up
in
the
essences
which
they
display
thus
bradley
maintained
that
two
thoughts
no
matter
how
remote
from
each
other
in
time
or
space
were
identically
the
same
and
not
merely
similar
if
only
they
contemplated
the
same
idea
mind
itself
ceased
in
this
way
to
mean
a
series
of
existing
feelings
and
was
identified
with
intelligence
and
intelligence
in
its
turn
was
identified
with
the
idea
or
logos
which
might
be
the
ultimate
theme
of
intelligence
there
could
be
only
one
mind
so
conceived
since
there
could
be
only
one
total
system
in
the
universe
visible
to
omniscience
as
to
romantic
scepticism
we
may
see
by
contrast
what
it
would
be
when
left
to
itself
if
we
consider
those
lucid
italians
who
have
taken
up
their
idealism
late
and
with
open
eyes
in
croce
and
gentile
the
transcendental
attitude
is
kept
pure
for
them
there
is
really
no
universe
save
spirit
creating
its
experience
and
if
we
ask
whence
or
on
what
principle
occasions
arise
for
all
this
compulsory
fiction
we
are
reminded
that
this
question
with
any
answer
which
spirit
might
invent
for
it
belongs
not
to
philosophy
but
to
some
special
science
like
physiology
itself
of
course
only
a
particular
product
of
creative
thought
thus
the
more
impetuously
the
inquisitive
squirrel
would
rush
from
his
cage
the
faster
and
faster
he
causes
the
cage
to
whirl
about
his
ears
he
has
not
the
remotest
chance
of
reaching
his
imaginary
bait
god
nature
or
truth
for
to
seek
such
things
is
to
presuppose
them
and
to
presuppose
anything
if
spirit
be
absolute
is
to
invent
it
even
those
philosophies
of
history
which
the
idealist
may
for
some
secret
reason
be
impelled
to
construct
would
be
superstitious
according
to
his
own
principles
if
he
took
them
for
more
than
poetic
fictions
of
the
historian
so
that
in
the
study
of
history
as
in
every
other
study
all
the
diligence
and
sober
learning
which
the
philosopher
may
possess
are
since
they
presuppose
independent
events
and
material
documents
thus
perfect
idealism
turns
out
to
be
pure
literary
sport
like
lyric
poetry
in
which
no
truth
is
conveyed
save
the
miscellaneous
truths
taken
over
from
common
sense
or
the
special
sciences
and
the
gay
spirit
supposed
to
be
living
and
shining
of
its
own
sweet
will
can
find
nothing
to
live
or
shine
upon
save
the
common
natural
world
such
at
least
would
be
the
case
if
romantic
superstition
did
not
supervene
demanding
that
the
spirit
should
impose
some
arbitrary
rhythm
or
destiny
on
the
world
which
it
creates
but
this
side
of
idealism
has
been
cultivated
chiefly
by
the
intrepid
germans
some
of
them
like
spengler
and
keyserling
still
thrive
and
grow
famous
on
it
without
a
blush
the
modest
english
in
these
matters
take
shelter
under
the
wing
of
science
speculatively
extended
or
traditional
religion
prudently
rationalised
the
scope
of
the
spirit
like
its
psychological
distribution
is
conceived
realistically
it
might
almost
prove
an
euthanasia
for
british
idealism
to
lose
itself
in
the
new
metaphysics
of
nature
which
the
mathematicians
are
evolving
and
since
this
metaphysics
though
materialistic
in
effect
is
more
subtle
and
abstruse
than
popular
materialism
british
idealism
might
perhaps
be
said
to
survive
in
it
having
now
passed
victoriously
into
its
opposite
and
being
merged
in
something

iii
revolutions
in
science
since
the
beginning
of
the
twentieth
century
science
has
gained
notably
in
expertness
and
lost
notably
in
authority
we
are
bombarded
with
inventions
but
if
we
ask
the
inventors
what
they
have
learned
of
the
depths
of
nature
which
somehow
they
have
probed
with
such
astonishing
success
their
faces
remain
blank
they
may
be
chewing
gum
or
they
may
tell
us
that
if
an
aeroplane
could
only
fly
fast
enough
it
would
get
home
before
it
starts
or
they
may
urge
us
to
come
with
them
into
a
dark
room
to
hold
hands
and
to
commune
with
the
dear
departed
practically
there
may
be
no
harm
in
such
a
division
of
labour
the
inventors
doing
the
work
and
the
professors
the
talking
the
experts
may
themselves
be
inexpert
in
verbal
expression
or
content
with
stock
phrases
or
profoundly
sceptical
or
too
busy
to
think
nevertheless
skill
and
understanding
are
at
their
best
when
they
go
together
and
adorn
the
same
mind
modern
science
until
lately
had
realised
this
ideal
it
was
an
extension
of
common
perception
and
common
sense
we
could
trust
it
implicitly
as
we
do
a
map
or
a
calendar
it
was
not
true
for
us
merely
in
an
argumentative
or
visionary
sense
as
are
religion
and
philosophy
geography
went
hand
in
hand
with
travel
copernican
astronomy
with
circumnavigation
of
the
globe
and
even
the
theory
of
evolution
and
the
historical
sciences
in
the
nineteenth
century
were
continuous
with
liberal
reform
people
saw
in
the
past
as
they
then
learned
to
conceive
it
simply
an
extension
of
those
transformations
which
they
were
witnessing
in
the
present
they
could
think
they
knew
the
world
as
a
man
knows
his
native
town
or
the
contents
of
his
chest
of
drawers
nature
was
our
home
and
science
was
our
home
knowledge
for
it
is
not
intrinsic
clearness
or
coherence
that
make
ideas
persuasive
but
connection
with
action
or
with
some
voluminous
inner
response
which
is
readiness
to
act
it
is
a
sense
of
fate
a
compulsion
to
do
or
to
suffer
that
produces
the
illusion
of
perfect
knowledge
i
call
it
illusion
although
our
contact
with
things
may
be
real
and
our
sensations
and
thoughts
may
be
inevitable
and
honest
because
nevertheless
it
is
always
an
illusion
to
suppose
that
our
images
are
the
intrinsic
qualities
of
things
or
reproduce
them
exactly
the
ptolemaic
system
for
instance
was
perfectly
scientific
it
was
based
on
careful
and
prolonged
observation
and
on
just
reasoning
but
it
was
modelled
on
an
image
the
spherical
blue
dome
of
the
heavens
proper
only
to
an
observer
on
the
earth
and
not
transferable
to
a
universe
which
is
diffuse
centreless
fluid
and
perhaps
infinite
when
the
imagination
for
any
reason
comes
to
be
peopled
with
images
of
the
latter
sort
the
modern
and
especially
the
latest
astronomy
becomes
more
persuasive
for
although
i
suspect
that
even
einstein
is
an
imperfect
relativist
and
retains
euclidean
space
and
absolute
time
at
the
bottom
of
his
calculation
and
recovers
them
at
the
end
yet
the
effort
to
express
the
system
of
nature
as
it
would
appear
from
station
and
to
sensorium
seems
to
be
eminently
enlightening
theory
and
practice
in
the
latest
science
are
still
allied
otherwise
neither
of
them
would
prosper
as
it
does
but
each
has
taken
a
leap
in
its
own
direction
the
distance
between
them
has
become
greater
than
the
naked
eye
can
measure
and
each
of
them
in
itself
has
become
unintelligible
we
roll
and
fly
at
dizzy
speeds
and
hear
at
incredible
distances
at
the
same
time
we
imagine
and
calculate
to
incredible
depths
the
technique
of
science
like
that
of
industry
has
become
a
thing
in
itself
the
one
veils
its
object
which
is
nature
as
the
other
defeats
its
purpose
which
is
happiness
science
often
seems
to
be
less
the
study
of
things
than
the
study
of
science
it
is
now
more
scholastic
than
philosophy
ever
was
we
are
invited
to
conceive
organisms
within
organisms
so
minute
so
free
and
so
dynamic
that
the
heart
of
matter
seems
to
explode
into
an
endless
discharge
of
fireworks
or
a
mathematical
nightmare
realised
in
a
thousand
places
at
once
and
become
the
substance
of
the
world
what
is
even
more
remarkable
for
the
notion
of
infinite
organisation
has
been
familiar
to
the
learned
at
least
since
the
time
of
leibniz
the
theatre
of
science
is
transformed
no
less
than
the
actors
and
the
play
the
upright
walls
of
space
the
steady
tread
of
time
begin
to
fail
us
they
bend
now
so
obligingly
to
our
perspectives
that
we
no
longer
seem
to
travel
through
them
but
to
carry
them
with
us
shooting
them
out
or
weaving
them
about
us
according
to
some
native
fatality
which
is
left
unexplained
we
seem
to
have
reverted
in
some
sense
from
copernicus
to
ptolemy
except
that
the
centre
is
now
occupied
not
by
the
solid
earth
but
by
geometrical
point
chosen
for
the
origin
of
calculation
time
too
is
not
measured
by
the
sun
or
stars
but
by
clock
that
is
by
any
recurrent
rhythm
taken
as
a
standard
of
comparison
it
would
seem
that
the
existence
and
energy
of
each
chosen
centre
as
well
as
its
career
and
encounters
hang
on
the
collateral
existence
of
other
centres
of
force
among
which
it
must
wend
its
way
yet
the
only
witness
to
their
presence
and
the
only
known
property
of
their
substance
is
their
or
the
physical
light
which
they
shed
light
in
its
physical
being
is
accordingly
the
measure
of
all
things
in
this
new
philosophy
and
if
we
ask
ourselves
why
this
element
should
have
been
preferred
the
answer
is
not
far
to
seek
light
is
the
only
medium
through
which
very
remote
or
very
minute
particles
of
matter
can
be
revealed
to
science
whatever
the
nature
of
things
may
be
intrinsically
science
must
accordingly
express
the
universe
in
terms
of
light
these
reforms
have
come
from
within
they
are
triumphs
of
method
we
make
an
evident
advance
in
logic
and
in
that
parsimony
which
is
dear
to
philosophers
though
not
to
nature
if
we
refuse
to
assign
given
terms
and
relations
to
any
prior
medium
such
as
absolute
time
or
space
which
can
not
be
given
with
them
observable
spaces
and
times
like
the
facts
observed
in
them
are
given
separately
and
in
a
desultory
fashion
initially
then
there
are
as
many
spaces
and
times
as
there
are
observers
or
rather
observations
these
are
the
specious
times
and
spaces
of
dreams
of
sensuous
life
and
of
romantic
biography
each
is
centred
here
and
now
and
stretched
outwards
forward
and
back
as
far
as
imagination
has
the
strength
to
project
it
then
when
objects
and
events
have
been
posited
as
and
when
a
clock
and
a
system
of
have
been
established
for
measuring
them
a
single
mathematical
space
and
time
may
be
deployed
about
them
conceived
to
contain
all
things
and
to
supply
them
with
their
respective
places
and
dates
this
gives
us
the
cosmos
of
classical
physics
but
this
system
involves
the
uncritical
notion
of
light
and
matter
travelling
through
media
previously
existing
and
being
carried
down
like
a
boat
drifting
down
stream
by
a
flowing
time
which
has
a
pace
of
its
own
and
imposes
it
on
all
existence
in
reality
each
clock
and
each
landscape
is
and
initially
absolute
its
time
and
space
are
irrelevant
to
those
of
any
other
landscape
or
clock
unless
the
objects
or
events
revealed
there
being
posited
as
actually
coincide
with
those
revealed
also
in
another
landscape
or
dated
by
another
clock
it
is
only
by
travelling
along
its
own
path
at
its
own
rate
that
experience
or
light
can
ever
reach
a
point
lying
on
another
path
also
so
that
two
observations
and
two
measures
may
coincide
at
their
ultimate
terms
their
or
their
ends
positions
are
therefore
not
independent
of
the
journey
which
terminates
in
them
and
thereby
individuates
them
and
dates
are
not
independent
of
the
events
which
distinguish
them
the
flux
of
existence
comes
first
matter
and
light
distend
time
by
their
pulses
they
distend
space
by
their
deployments
this
if
i
understand
it
is
one
half
the
new
theory
the
other
half
is
not
less
acceptable
newton
had
described
motion
as
a
result
of
two
principles
the
first
inertia
was
supposed
to
be
inherent
in
bodies
the
second
gravity
was
incidental
to
their
yet
inherent
inertia
can
only
be
observed
relatively
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
i
am
said
to
be
moving
at
a
great
speed
or
absolutely
at
rest
if
i
am
not
jolted
or
breathless
and
if
my
felt
environment
does
not
change
inertia
or
weight
in
so
far
as
it
denotes
something
intrinsic
seems
to
be
but
another
name
for
substance
or
the
principle
of
existence
in
so
far
as
it
denotes
the
first
law
of
motion
it
seems
to
be
relative
to
an
environment
it
would
therefore
be
preferable
to
combine
inertia
and
attraction
in
a
single
formula
expressing
the
behaviour
of
bodies
towards
one
another
in
all
their
conjunctions
without
introducing
any
inherent
forces
or
absolute
measures
this
seems
to
have
been
done
by
einstein
or
at
least
impressively
suggested
and
it
has
been
found
that
the
new
calculations
correspond
to
certain
delicate
observations
more
accurately
than
the
old
this
revolution
in
science
seems
then
to
be
perfectly
legal
and
ought
to
be
welcomed
yet
only
under
one
important
moral
condition
and
with
a
paradoxical
result
the
moral
condition
is
that
the
pride
of
science
should
turn
into
humility
that
it
should
no
longer
imagine
that
it
is
laying
bare
the
intrinsic
nature
of
things
and
the
paradoxical
result
is
this
that
the
forms
of
science
are
optional
like
various
languages
or
methods
of
notation
one
may
be
more
convenient
or
subtle
than
another
according
to
the
place
senses
interests
and
scope
of
the
explorer
a
reform
in
science
may
render
the
old
theories
antiquated
like
the
habit
of
wearing
togas
or
of
going
naked
but
it
can
not
render
them
false
or
itself
true
science
when
it
is
more
than
the
gossip
of
adventure
or
of
experiment
yields
practical
assurances
couched
in
symbolic
terms
but
no
ultimate
insight
so
that
the
intellectual
vacancy
of
the
expert
which
i
was
deriding
is
a
sort
of
warrant
of
his
solidity
it
is
rather
when
the
expert
prophesies
when
he
propounds
a
new
philosophy
founded
on
his
latest
experiments
that
we
may
justly
smile
at
his
system
and
wait
for
the
next
and
the
new
science
is
full
of
is
a
great
liberator
if
perhaps
it
imposes
some
retrenchment
essentially
it
revives
courage
then
at
last
we
see
what
we
are
and
what
we
can
do
the
spirit
can
abandon
its
vain
commitments
and
false
pretensions
like
a
young
man
free
at
last
to
throw
off
his
clothes
and
run
naked
along
the
sands
intelligence
is
never
gayer
never
surer
than
when
it
is
strictly
formal
satisfied
with
the
evidence
of
its
materials
as
with
the
lights
of
jewels
and
filled
with
mounting
speculations
as
with
a
sort
of
laughter
if
all
the
arts
aspire
to
the
condition
of
music
all
the
sciences
aspire
to
the
condition
of
mathematics
their
logic
is
their
spontaneous
and
intelligible
side
and
while
they
differ
from
mathematics
and
from
one
another
in
being
directed
in
the
first
instance
upon
various
unintelligible
existing
objects
yet
as
they
advance
they
unite
because
they
are
everywhere
striving
to
discover
in
those
miscellaneous
objects
some
intelligible
order
and
method
and
as
the
emotion
of
the
pure
artist
whatever
may
be
his
materials
lies
in
finding
in
them
some
formal
harmony
or
imposing
it
upon
them
so
the
interest
of
the
scientific
mind
in
so
far
as
it
is
free
and
purely
intellectual
lies
in
tracing
their
formal
pattern
the
mathematician
can
afford
to
leave
to
his
clients
the
engineers
or
perhaps
the
popular
philosophers
the
emotion
of
belief
for
himself
he
keeps
the
lyrical
pleasure
of
metre
and
of
evolving
equations
and
it
is
a
pleasant
surprise
to
him
and
an
added
problem
if
he
finds
that
the
arts
can
use
his
calculations
or
that
the
senses
can
verify
them
much
as
if
a
composer
found
that
the
sailors
could
heave
better
when
singing
his
songs
yet
such
independence
however
glorious
inwardly
can
not
help
diminishing
the
prestige
of
the
arts
in
the
world
if
science
misled
us
before
when
it
was
full
of
clearness
and
confidence
how
shall
we
trust
it
now
that
it
is
all
mystery
and
paradox
if
classical
physics
needed
this
fundamental
revision
near
to
experience
and
fruitful
as
it
was
what
revision
will
not
romantic
physics
require
nor
is
the
future
alone
insecure
even
now
the
prophets
hardly
understand
one
another
or
perhaps
themselves
and
some
of
them
interlard
their
science
with
the
most
dubious
metaphysics
naturally
the
enemies
of
science
have
not
been
slow
to
seize
this
opportunity
the
the
the
superstitious
are
all
raising
their
voices
no
longer
in
desperate
resistance
to
science
but
hopefully
and
in
its
name
science
they
tell
us
is
no
longer
hostile
to
religion
or
to
divination
of
any
sort
indeed
divination
is
a
science
too
physics
is
no
longer
materialistic
since
space
is
now
curved
and
filled
with
an
ether
through
which
light
travels
at
kilometres
per
second
an
immaterial
rate
because
if
anything
material
ventured
to
move
at
that
forbidden
speed
it
would
be
so
flattened
that
it
would
cease
to
exist
indeed
matter
is
now
hardly
needed
at
all
its
place
has
been
taken
by
and
by
electrons
which
dart
and
whirl
with
such
miraculous
swiftness
that
occasionally
for
no
known
reason
they
can
skip
from
orbit
to
orbit
without
traversing
the
intervening
positions
an
evident
proof
of
in
them
or
if
solids
should
still
seem
to
be
material
there
are
astral
bodies
as
well
which
are
immaterial
although
physical
and
as
to
ether
and
electricity
they
are
the
very
substance
of
spirit
all
this
i
find
announced
in
newspapers
and
even
in
books
as
the
breakdown
of
scientific
materialism
and
yet
when
was
materialism
more
arrant
and
barbarous
than
in
these
announcements
something
no
doubt
has
broken
down
but
i
am
afraid
it
is
rather
the
habit
of
thinking
clearly
and
the
power
to
discern
the
difference
between
material
and
spiritual
things
the
latest
revolution
in
science
will
probably
not
be
the
last
i
do
not
know
what
internal
difficulties
contradictions
or
ominous
obscurities
may
exist
in
the
new
theories
or
what
logical
seeds
of
change
perhaps
of
radical
change
might
be
discovered
there
by
a
competent
critic
i
base
my
expectation
on
two
circumstances
somewhat
more
external
and
visible
to
the
lay
mind
one
circumstance
is
that
the
new
theories
seem
to
be
affected
and
partly
inspired
by
a
particular
philosophy
itself
utterly
insecure
this
philosophy
regards
the
point
of
view
as
controlling
or
even
creating
the
object
seen
in
other
words
it
identifies
the
object
with
the
experience
or
the
knowledge
of
it
it
is
essentially
a
subjective
psychological
protestant
philosophy
the
study
of
perspectives
which
a
severer
critic
might
call
illusions
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
enlightening
of
studies
and
for
my
own
part
i
should
be
content
to
dwell
almost
exclusively
in
that
poetic
and
moral
atmosphere
in
the
realm
of
literature
and
of
humanism
yet
i
can
not
help
seeing
that
neither
in
logic
nor
in
natural
genesis
can
perspectives
be
the
ultimate
object
of
science
since
a
plurality
of
points
of
view
somehow
comparable
must
be
assumed
in
the
beginning
as
well
as
common
principles
of
projection
and
ulterior
points
of
contact
or
coincidence
such
assumptions
which
must
persist
throughout
seem
to
presuppose
an
absolute
system
of
nature
behind
all
the
relative
systems
of
science
the
other
circumstance
which
points
to
further
revolutions
is
social
the
new
science
is
unintelligible
to
almost
all
of
us
it
can
be
tested
only
by
very
delicate
observations
and
very
difficult
reasoning
we
accept
it
on
the
authority
of
a
few
professors
who
themselves
have
accepted
it
with
a
contagious
alacrity
as
if
caught
in
a
whirlwind
it
has
sprung
up
mysteriously
and
mightily
like
mysticism
in
a
cloister
or
theology
in
a
council
a
soviet
of
learned
men
has
proclaimed
it
moreover
it
is
not
merely
a
system
among
systems
but
a
movement
among
movements
a
system
even
when
it
has
serious
rivals
may
be
maintained
for
centuries
as
religions
are
maintained
institutionally
but
a
movement
comes
to
an
end
it
is
followed
presently
by
a
period
of
assimilation
which
transforms
it
or
by
a
movement
in
some
other
direction
i
ask
myself
accordingly
whether
the
condition
of
the
world
in
the
coming
years
will
be
favourable
to
refined
and
paradoxical
science
the
extension
of
education
will
have
enabled
the
uneducated
to
pronounce
upon
everything
will
the
patronage
of
capital
and
enterprise
subsist
to
encourage
discovery
and
reward
invention
will
a
jealous
and
dogmatic
democracy
respect
the
unintelligible
insight
of
the
few
will
a
perhaps
starving
democracy
support
materially
its
soviet
of
seers
but
let
us
suppose
that
no
utilitarian
fanaticism
supervenes
and
no
intellectual
surfeit
or
discouragement
may
not
the
very
profundity
of
the
new
science
and
its
metaphysical
affinities
lead
it
to
bolder
developments
inscrutable
to
the
public
and
incompatible
with
one
another
like
the
gnostic
sects
of
declining
antiquity
then
perhaps
that
luminous
modern
thing
which
until
recently
was
called
science
in
contrast
to
all
personal
philosophies
may
cease
to
exist
altogether
being
petrified
into
routine
in
the
practitioners
and
fading
in
the
professors
into
abstruse
speculations
iv
a
long
way
round
to
nirvana
that
the
end
of
life
is
death
may
be
called
a
truism
since
the
various
kinds
of
immortality
that
might
perhaps
supervene
would
none
of
them
abolish
death
but
at
best
would
weave
life
and
death
together
into
the
texture
of
a
more
comprehensive
destiny
the
end
of
one
life
might
be
the
beginning
of
another
if
the
creator
had
composed
his
great
work
like
a
dramatic
poet
assigning
successive
lines
to
different
characters
death
would
then
be
merely
the
cue
at
the
end
of
each
speech
summoning
the
next
personage
to
break
in
and
keep
the
ball
rolling
or
perhaps
as
some
suppose
all
the
characters
are
assumed
in
turn
by
a
single
supernatural
spirit
who
amid
his
endless
improvisations
is
imagining
himself
living
for
the
moment
in
this
particular
solar
and
social
system
death
in
such
a
universal
monologue
would
be
but
a
change
of
scene
or
of
metre
while
in
the
scramble
of
a
real
comedy
it
would
be
a
change
of
actors
in
either
case
every
voice
would
be
silenced
sooner
or
later
and
death
would
end
each
particular
life
in
spite
of
all
possible
sequels
the
relapse
of
created
things
into
nothing
is
no
violent
fatality
but
something
naturally
quite
smooth
and
proper
this
has
been
set
forth
recently
in
a
novel
way
by
a
philosopher
from
whom
we
hardly
expected
such
a
lesson
namely
professor
sigmund
freud
he
has
now
broadened
his
conception
of
sexual
craving
or
into
a
general
principle
of
attraction
or
concretion
in
matter
like
the
eros
of
the
ancient
poets
hesiod
and
empedocles
the
windows
of
that
stuffy
clinic
have
been
thrown
open
that
smell
of
acrid
disinfectants
those
hysterical
shrieks
have
escaped
into
the
cold
night
the
troubles
of
the
sick
soul
we
are
given
to
understand
as
well
as
their
cure
after
all
flow
from
the
stars
i
am
glad
that
freud
has
resisted
the
tendency
to
represent
this
principle
of
love
as
the
only
principle
in
nature
unity
somehow
exercises
an
evil
spell
over
metaphysicians
it
is
admitted
that
in
real
life
it
is
not
well
for
one
to
be
alone
and
i
think
pure
unity
is
no
less
barren
and
graceless
in
metaphysics
you
must
have
plurality
to
start
with
or
trinity
or
at
least
duality
if
you
wish
to
get
anywhere
even
if
you
wish
to
get
effectively
into
the
bosom
of
the
one
abandoning
your
separate
existence
freud
like
empedocles
has
prudently
introduced
a
prior
principle
for
love
to
play
with
not
strife
however
which
is
only
an
incident
in
love
but
inertia
or
the
tendency
towards
peace
and
death
let
us
suppose
that
matter
was
originally
dead
and
perfectly
content
to
be
so
and
that
it
still
relapses
when
it
can
into
its
old
equilibrium
but
the
homogeneous
as
spencer
would
say
when
it
is
finite
is
unstable
and
matter
presumably
not
being
with
space
necessarily
forms
aggregates
which
have
an
inside
and
an
outside
the
parts
of
such
bodies
are
accordingly
differently
exposed
to
external
influences
and
differently
related
to
one
another
this
inequality
even
in
what
seems
most
quiescent
is
big
with
changes
destined
to
produce
in
time
a
wonderful
complexity
it
is
the
source
of
all
uneasiness
of
life
and
of
love
let
us
imagine
writes
freud
an
undifferentiated
vesicle
of
sensitive
substance
then
its
surface
exposed
as
it
is
to
the
outer
world
is
by
its
very
position
differentiated
and
serves
as
an
organ
for
receiving
stimuli
this
morsel
of
living
substance
floats
about
in
an
outer
world
which
is
charged
with
the
most
potent
energies
and
it
would
be
destroyed
if
it
were
not
furnished
with
protection
against
stimulation
on
the
other
hand
the
sensitive
cortical
layer
has
no
protective
barrier
against
excitations
emanating
from
within
the
most
prolific
sources
of
such
excitations
are
the
instincts
of
the
organism
the
child
never
gets
tired
of
demanding
the
repetition
of
a
game
he
wants
always
to
hear
the
same
story
instead
of
a
new
one
insists
inexorably
on
exact
repetition
and
corrects
each
deviation
which
the
narrator
lets
slip
by
mistake
according
to
this
instinct
would
be
a
tendency
in
living
organic
matter
impelling
it
towards
reinstatement
of
an
earlier
one
which
it
had
abandoned
under
the
influence
of
external
disturbing
forces
a
kind
of
organic
elasticity
or
to
put
it
another
way
the
manifestation
of
inertia
in
organic
life
if
then
all
organic
instincts
are
conservative
historically
acquired
and
directed
towards
regression
towards
reinstatement
of
something
earlier
we
are
obliged
to
place
all
the
results
of
organic
development
to
the
credit
of
external
disturbing
and
distracting
influences
the
rudimentary
creature
would
from
its
very
beginning
not
have
wanted
to
change
would
if
circumstances
had
remained
the
same
have
always
merely
repeated
the
same
course
of
existence
it
would
be
counter
to
the
conservative
nature
of
instinct
if
the
goal
of
life
were
a
state
never
hitherto
reached
it
must
be
rather
an
ancient
starting
point
which
the
living
being
left
long
ago
and
to
which
it
harks
back
again
by
all
the
circuitous
paths
of
development
goal
of
all
life
is
death
through
a
long
period
of
time
the
living
substance
may
have
had
death
within
easy
reach
until
decisive
external
influences
altered
in
such
a
way
as
to
compel
it
to
ever
greater
deviations
from
the
original
path
of
life
and
to
ever
more
complicated
and
circuitous
routes
to
the
attainment
of
the
goal
of
death
these
circuitous
ways
to
death
faithfully
retained
by
the
conservative
instincts
would
be
neither
more
nor
less
than
the
phenomena
of
life
as
we
know
it
freud
puts
forth
these
interesting
suggestions
with
much
modesty
admitting
that
they
are
vague
and
uncertain
and
what
it
is
even
more
important
to
notice
mythical
in
their
terms
but
it
seems
to
me
that
for
all
that
they
are
an
admirable
counterblast
to
prevalent
follies
when
we
hear
that
there
is
animating
the
whole
universe
an
or
general
impulse
toward
some
unknown
but
single
ideal
the
terms
used
are
no
less
uncertain
mythical
and
vague
but
the
suggestion
conveyed
is
false
false
i
mean
to
the
organic
source
of
life
and
aspiration
to
the
simple
naturalness
of
nature
whereas
the
suggestion
conveyed
by
speculations
is
true
in
what
sense
can
myths
and
metaphors
be
true
or
false
in
the
sense
that
in
terms
drawn
from
moral
predicaments
or
from
literary
psychology
they
may
report
the
general
movement
and
the
pertinent
issue
of
material
facts
and
may
inspire
us
with
a
wise
sentiment
in
their
presence
in
this
sense
i
should
say
that
greek
mythology
was
true
and
calvinist
theology
was
false
the
chief
terms
employed
in
have
always
been
metaphorical
unconscious
wishes
the
the
oedipus
complex
narcissism
the
censor
nevertheless
interesting
and
profound
vistas
may
be
opened
up
in
such
terms
into
the
tangle
of
events
in
a
man
life
and
a
fresh
start
may
be
made
with
fewer
encumbrances
and
less
morbid
inhibition
the
shortcomings
of
our
description
freud
says
would
probably
disappear
if
for
psychological
terms
we
could
substitute
physiological
or
chemical
ones
these
too
only
constitute
a
metaphorical
language
but
one
familiar
to
us
for
a
much
longer
time
and
perhaps
also
simpler
all
human
discourse
is
metaphorical
in
that
our
perceptions
and
thoughts
are
adventitious
signs
for
their
objects
as
names
are
and
by
no
means
copies
of
what
is
going
on
materially
in
the
depths
of
nature
but
just
as
the
sportsman
eye
which
yields
but
a
summary
graphic
image
can
trace
the
flight
of
a
bird
through
the
air
quite
well
enough
to
shoot
it
and
bring
it
down
so
the
myths
of
a
wise
philosopher
about
the
origin
of
life
or
of
dreams
though
expressed
symbolically
may
reveal
the
pertinent
movement
of
nature
to
us
and
may
kindle
in
us
just
sentiments
and
true
expectations
in
respect
to
our
fate
for
his
own
soul
is
the
bird
this
sportsman
is
shooting
now
i
think
these
new
myths
of
freud
about
life
like
his
old
ones
about
dreams
are
calculated
to
enlighten
and
to
chasten
us
enormously
about
ourselves
the
human
spirit
when
it
awakes
finds
itself
in
trouble
it
is
burdened
for
no
reason
it
can
assign
with
all
sorts
of
anxieties
about
food
pressures
pricks
noises
and
pains
it
is
born
as
another
wise
myth
has
it
in
original
sin
and
the
passions
and
ambitions
of
life
as
they
come
on
only
complicate
this
burden
and
make
it
heavier
without
rendering
it
less
incessant
or
gratuitous
whence
this
fatality
and
whither
does
it
lead
it
comes
from
heredity
and
it
leads
to
propagation
when
we
ask
how
heredity
could
be
started
or
transmitted
our
ignorance
of
nature
and
of
past
time
reduces
us
to
silence
or
to
wild
conjectures
something
let
us
call
it
matter
must
always
have
existed
and
some
of
its
parts
under
pressure
of
the
others
must
have
got
tied
up
into
knots
like
the
mainspring
of
a
watch
in
such
a
violent
and
unhappy
manner
that
when
the
pressure
is
relaxed
they
fly
open
as
fast
as
they
can
and
unravel
themselves
with
a
vast
sense
of
relief
hence
the
longing
to
satisfy
latent
passions
with
the
fugitive
pleasure
in
doing
so
but
the
external
agencies
that
originally
wound
up
that
mainspring
never
cease
to
operate
every
fresh
stimulus
gives
it
another
turn
until
it
snaps
or
grows
flaccid
or
is
unhinged
moreover
from
time
to
time
when
circumstances
change
these
external
agencies
may
encrust
that
primary
organ
with
minor
organs
attached
to
it
every
impression
every
adventure
leaves
a
trace
or
rather
a
seed
behind
it
it
produces
a
further
complication
in
the
structure
of
the
body
a
fresh
charge
which
tends
to
repeat
the
impressed
motion
in
season
and
out
of
season
hence
that
perpetual
docility
or
ductility
in
living
substance
which
enables
it
to
learn
tricks
to
remember
facts
and
when
the
seeds
of
past
experiences
marry
and
cross
in
the
brain
to
imagine
new
experiences
pleasing
or
horrible
every
act
initiates
a
new
habit
and
may
implant
a
new
instinct
we
see
people
even
late
in
life
carried
away
by
political
or
religious
contagions
or
developing
strange
vices
there
would
be
no
peace
in
old
age
but
rather
a
greater
and
greater
obsession
by
all
sorts
of
cares
were
it
not
that
time
in
exposing
us
to
many
adventitious
influences
weakens
or
discharges
our
primitive
passions
we
are
less
greedy
less
lusty
less
hopeful
less
generous
but
these
weakened
primitive
impulses
are
naturally
by
far
the
strongest
and
most
deeply
rooted
in
the
organism
so
that
although
an
old
man
may
be
converted
or
may
take
up
some
hobby
there
is
usually
something
thin
in
his
elderly
zeal
compared
with
the
heartiness
of
youth
nor
is
it
edifying
to
see
a
soul
in
which
the
plainer
human
passions
are
extinct
becoming
a
hotbed
of
chance
delusions
in
any
case
each
fresh
habit
taking
root
in
the
organism
forms
a
little
mainspring
or
instinct
of
its
own
like
a
parasite
so
that
an
elaborate
mechanism
is
gradually
developed
where
each
lever
and
spring
holds
the
other
down
and
all
hold
the
mainspring
down
together
allowing
it
to
unwind
itself
only
very
gradually
and
meantime
keeping
the
whole
clock
ticking
and
revolving
and
causing
the
smooth
outer
face
which
it
turns
to
the
world
so
clean
and
innocent
to
mark
the
time
of
day
amiably
for
the
but
there
is
a
terribly
complicated
labour
going
on
beneath
propelled
with
difficulty
and
balanced
precariously
with
much
secret
friction
and
failure
no
wonder
that
the
engine
often
gets
visibly
out
of
order
or
stops
short
the
marvel
is
that
it
ever
manages
to
go
at
all
nor
is
it
satisfied
with
simply
revolving
and
when
at
last
dismounted
starting
afresh
in
the
person
of
some
seed
it
has
dropped
a
portion
of
its
substance
with
all
its
concentrated
instincts
wound
up
tightly
within
it
and
eager
to
repeat
the
ancestral
experiment
all
this
growth
is
not
merely
material
and
vain
each
clock
in
revolving
strikes
the
hour
even
the
quarters
and
often
with
lovely
chimes
these
chimes
we
call
perceptions
feelings
purposes
and
dreams
and
it
is
because
we
are
taken
up
entirely
with
this
mental
music
and
perhaps
think
that
it
sounds
of
itself
and
needs
no
to
make
it
that
we
find
such
difficulty
in
conceiving
the
nature
of
our
own
clocks
and
are
compelled
to
describe
them
only
musically
that
is
in
myths
but
the
ineptitude
of
our
aesthetic
minds
to
unravel
the
nature
of
mechanism
does
not
deprive
these
minds
of
their
own
clearness
and
euphony
besides
sounding
their
various
musical
notes
they
have
the
cognitive
function
of
indicating
the
hour
and
catching
the
echoes
of
distant
events
or
of
maturing
inward
dispositions
this
information
and
emotion
added
to
incidental
pleasures
in
satisfying
our
various
passions
make
up
the
life
of
an
incarnate
spirit
they
reconcile
it
to
the
external
fatality
that
has
wound
up
the
organism
and
is
breaking
it
down
and
they
rescue
this
organism
and
all
its
works
from
the
indignity
of
being
a
vain
complication
and
a
waste
of
motion
that
the
end
of
life
should
be
death
may
sound
sad
yet
what
other
end
can
anything
have
the
end
of
an
evening
party
is
to
go
to
bed
but
its
use
is
to
gather
congenial
people
together
that
they
may
pass
the
time
pleasantly
an
invitation
to
the
dance
is
not
rendered
ironical
because
the
dance
can
not
last
for
ever
the
youngest
of
us
and
the
most
vigorously
wound
up
after
a
few
hours
has
had
enough
of
sinuous
stepping
and
prancing
the
transitoriness
of
things
is
essential
to
their
physical
being
and
not
at
all
sad
in
itself
it
becomes
sad
by
virtue
of
a
sentimental
illusion
which
makes
us
imagine
that
they
wish
to
endure
and
that
their
end
is
always
untimely
but
in
a
healthy
nature
it
is
not
so
what
is
truly
sad
is
to
have
some
impulse
frustrated
in
the
midst
of
its
career
and
robbed
of
its
chosen
object
and
what
is
painful
is
to
have
an
organ
lacerated
or
destroyed
when
it
is
still
vigorous
and
not
ready
for
its
natural
sleep
and
dissolution
we
must
not
confuse
the
itch
which
our
unsatisfied
instincts
continue
to
cause
with
the
pleasure
of
satisfying
and
dismissing
each
of
them
in
turn
could
they
all
be
satisfied
harmoniously
we
should
be
satisfied
once
for
all
and
completely
then
doing
and
dying
would
coincide
throughout
and
be
a
perfect
pleasure
this
same
insight
is
contained
in
another
wise
myth
which
has
inspired
morality
and
religion
in
india
from
time
immemorial
i
mean
the
doctrine
of
karma
we
are
born
it
says
with
a
heritage
a
character
imposed
and
a
long
task
assigned
all
due
to
the
ignorance
which
in
our
past
lives
has
led
us
into
all
sorts
of
commitments
these
obligations
we
must
pay
off
relieving
the
pure
spirit
within
us
from
its
accumulated
burdens
from
debts
and
assets
both
equally
oppressive
we
can
not
disentangle
ourselves
by
mere
frivolity
nor
by
suicide
frivolity
would
only
involve
us
more
deeply
in
the
toils
of
fate
and
suicide
would
but
truncate
our
misery
and
leave
us
for
ever
a
confessed
failure
when
life
is
understood
to
be
a
process
of
redemption
its
various
phases
are
taken
up
in
turn
without
haste
and
without
undue
attachment
their
coming
and
going
have
all
the
keenness
of
pleasure
the
holiness
of
sacrifice
and
the
beauty
of
art
the
point
is
to
have
expressed
and
discharged
all
that
was
latent
in
us
and
to
this
perfect
relief
various
temperaments
and
various
traditions
assign
different
names
calling
it
having
one
day
or
doing
one
duty
or
realising
one
ideal
or
saving
one
soul
the
task
in
any
case
is
definite
and
imposed
on
us
by
nature
whether
we
recognise
it
or
not
therefore
we
can
make
true
moral
progress
or
fall
into
real
errors
wisdom
and
genius
lie
in
discerning
this
prescribed
task
and
in
doing
it
readily
cleanly
and
without
distraction
folly
on
the
contrary
imagines
that
any
scent
is
worth
following
that
we
have
an
infinite
nature
or
no
nature
in
particular
that
life
begins
without
obligations
and
can
do
business
without
capital
and
that
the
will
is
vacuously
free
instead
of
being
a
specific
burden
and
a
tight
hereditary
knot
to
be
unravelled
some
philosophers
without
think
that
the
variations
and
further
entanglements
which
the
future
may
bring
are
the
manifestation
of
spirit
but
they
are
as
freud
has
indicated
imposed
on
living
beings
by
external
pressure
and
take
shape
in
the
realm
of
matter
it
is
only
after
the
organs
of
spirit
are
formed
mechanically
that
spirit
can
exist
and
can
distinguish
the
better
from
the
worse
in
the
fate
of
those
organs
and
therefore
in
its
own
fate
spirit
has
nothing
to
do
with
infinite
existence
infinite
existence
is
something
physical
and
ambiguous
there
is
no
scale
in
it
and
no
centre
the
depths
of
the
human
heart
are
finite
and
they
are
dark
only
to
ignorance
deep
and
dark
as
a
soul
may
be
when
you
look
down
into
it
from
outside
it
is
something
perfectly
natural
and
the
same
understanding
that
can
unearth
our
suppressed
young
passions
and
dispel
our
stubborn
bad
habits
can
show
us
where
our
true
good
lies
nature
has
marked
out
the
path
for
us
beforehand
there
are
snares
in
it
but
also
primroses
and
it
leads
to
peace
v
the
prestige
of
the
infinite
the
more
complex
the
world
becomes
and
the
more
it
rises
above
the
indeterminate
so
much
the
farther
removed
it
is
from
god
that
is
to
say
so
much
the
more
impious
it
is
julien
benda
is
not
led
to
this
startling
utterance
by
any
political
or
sentimental
grudge
it
is
not
the
late
war
nor
the
peace
of
versailles
nor
the
parlous
state
of
the
arts
nor
the
decay
of
morality
and
prosperity
that
disgusts
him
with
our
confused
world
it
is
simply
overmastering
respect
for
the
infinite
trahison
des
or
treason
of
the
levites
with
which
he
had
previously
upbraided
the
intellectuals
of
his
time
now
appears
to
consist
precisely
in
coveting
a
part
in
this
world
inheritance
and
forgetting
that
the
inheritance
of
the
levites
is
the
lord
which
being
interpreted
philosophically
means
that
a
philosopher
is
bound
to
measure
all
things
by
the
infinite
this
infinite
is
not
rhetorical
as
if
we
spoke
of
infinite
thought
or
infinite
love
it
is
nothing
but
number
benda
tells
us
seems
to
him
intelligible
time
space
volume
and
complexity
which
appears
to
the
senses
as
quality
stretch
in
a
series
of
units
positions
or
degrees
to
infinity
as
number
does
and
in
such
homogeneous
series
infinite
in
both
directions
there
will
be
no
fixed
point
of
origin
for
counting
or
surveying
the
whole
and
no
particular
predominant
scale
every
position
will
be
essentially
identical
with
every
other
every
suggested
structure
will
be
collapsible
and
reversible
and
the
position
and
relations
of
every
unit
will
be
indistinguishable
from
those
of
every
other
in
the
infinite
benda
says
the
parts
have
no
identity
each
number
in
the
scale
as
we
begin
counting
from
different
points
of
origin
bears
also
every
other
number
this
is
no
mere
mathematical
puzzle
the
thought
has
a
strange
moral
eloquence
seen
in
their
infinite
setting
which
we
may
presume
to
be
their
ultimate
environment
all
things
lose
their
central
position
and
their
dominant
emphasis
the
contrary
of
what
we
first
think
of
them
or
of
ourselves
for
instance
that
we
are
alive
while
they
are
dead
or
unborn
is
also
true
egotism
becomes
absurd
pride
and
shame
become
the
vainest
of
illusions
if
then
it
be
repugnant
to
reason
that
the
series
of
numbers
moments
positions
and
volumes
should
be
limited
and
the
human
spirit
has
a
great
affinity
to
the
infinite
all
specific
quality
and
variety
in
things
must
be
superficial
and
deeply
unreal
they
are
masks
in
the
carnival
of
phenomena
to
be
observed
without
conviction
and
secretly
dismissed
as
ironical
by
those
who
have
laid
up
their
treasure
in
the
infinite
this
mathematical
dissolution
of
particulars
is
reinforced
by
moral
considerations
which
are
more
familiar
existence
any
specific
fact
asserting
itself
in
any
particular
place
or
moment
is
inevitably
contingent
arbitrary
gratuitous
and
insecure
a
sense
of
insecurity
is
likely
to
be
the
first
wedge
by
which
repentance
penetrates
into
the
animal
heart
if
a
man
did
not
foresee
death
and
fear
it
he
might
never
come
at
all
to
the
unnatural
thought
of
renouncing
life
in
fact
he
does
not
often
remember
death
yet
his
whole
gay
world
is
secretly
afraid
of
being
found
out
of
being
foiled
in
the
systematic
bluff
by
which
it
lives
as
if
its
life
were
immortal
and
far
more
than
the
brave
young
man
fears
death
in
his
own
person
the
whole
life
of
the
world
fears
to
be
exorcised
by
and
lost
in
air
and
with
good
reason
because
whether
we
stop
to
notice
this
circumstance
or
not
every
fact
every
laborious
beloved
achievement
of
man
or
of
nature
has
come
to
exist
against
infinite
odds
in
the
dark
of
being
this
chosen
fact
was
surrounded
by
innumerable
possible
variations
or
contradictions
of
it
and
each
of
those
possibilities
happening
not
to
be
realised
here
and
now
yet
possesses
intrinsically
exactly
the
same
aptitude
or
claim
to
existence
nor
are
these
claims
and
aptitudes
merely
imaginary
and
practically
contemptible
the
flux
of
existence
is
continually
repenting
of
its
choices
and
giving
everything
actual
the
lie
by
continually
substituting
something
else
no
less
specific
and
no
less
nugatory
world
world
exists
only
by
an
unmerited
privilege
its
glory
is
offensive
to
the
spirit
like
the
of
some
obstreperous
nobody
who
happens
to
have
drawn
the
big
prize
in
a
lottery
the
world
benda
writes
inspires
me
with
a
double
sentiment
i
feel
it
to
be
full
of
grandeur
because
it
has
succeeded
in
asserting
itself
and
coming
to
exist
and
i
feel
it
to
be
pitiful
when
i
consider
how
it
hung
on
a
mere
nothing
that
this
particular
world
should
never
have
existed
and
though
this
so
accidental
world
by
its
manifold
beauties
and
excitements
may
arouse
our
romantic
enthusiasm
it
is
fundamentally
an
world
its
creation
he
adds
in
italics
something
which
reason
would
wish
had
never
taken
for
we
must
not
suppose
that
god
when
god
is
defined
as
infinite
being
can
be
the
creator
of
the
world
such
a
notion
would
hopelessly
destroy
that
coherence
in
thought
to
which
benda
aspires
the
infinite
can
not
be
selective
it
can
not
possess
a
particular
structure
such
for
instance
as
the
trinity
nor
a
particular
quality
such
as
goodness
it
can
not
exert
power
or
give
direction
nothing
can
be
responsible
for
the
world
except
the
world
itself
it
has
created
or
is
creating
itself
perpetually
by
its
own
arbitrary
act
by
a
groundless
which
may
be
called
somewhat
metaphorically
will
or
even
original
sin
the
original
sin
of
existence
particularity
selfishness
or
separation
from
god
existence
being
absolutely
contingent
and
ungrounded
is
perfectly
free
and
if
it
ties
itself
up
in
its
own
habits
or
laws
and
becomes
a
terrible
nightmare
to
itself
by
its
automatic
monotony
that
still
is
only
its
own
work
and
figuratively
speaking
its
own
fault
nothing
save
its
own
arbitrary
and
needless
pressure
keeps
it
going
in
that
round
this
fatality
is
impressive
and
popular
religion
has
symbolised
it
in
the
person
of
a
deity
far
more
often
recognised
and
worshipped
than
infinite
being
this
popular
deity
a
symbol
for
the
forces
of
nature
and
history
the
patron
of
human
welfare
and
morality
benda
calls
the
imperial
god
it
is
clear
that
these
two
gods
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
the
god
whom
marshal
de
villars
rising
in
his
stirrups
and
pointing
his
drawn
sword
heavenwards
thanks
on
the
evening
of
denain
is
one
god
quite
another
is
the
god
within
whose
bosom
the
author
of
the
in
a
corner
of
his
cell
feels
the
nothingness
of
all
human
victories
it
follows
from
this
if
we
are
coherent
that
any
return
to
god
which
ascetic
philosophy
may
bring
about
can
not
be
a
social
reform
a
transition
to
some
better
form
of
natural
existence
in
a
promised
land
a
renovated
earth
or
a
material
or
temporal
heaven
nor
can
the
error
of
creation
be
corrected
violently
by
a
second
arbitrary
act
such
as
suicide
or
the
annihilation
of
the
universe
by
some
ultimate
general
collapse
if
such
events
happen
they
still
leave
the
door
open
to
new
creations
and
fresh
errors
but
the
marvel
is
i
will
return
to
this
point
presently
that
the
world
in
the
person
of
a
human
individual
endowed
with
reason
may
perceive
the
error
of
its
ways
and
correct
it
ideally
in
the
sphere
of
estimation
and
worship
such
is
the
only
possible
salvation
reason
in
order
to
save
us
and
we
in
order
to
be
saved
must
both
subsist
we
must
both
be
incidents
in
the
existing
world
we
may
then
by
the
operation
of
reason
in
us
recover
our
allegiance
to
the
infinite
for
we
are
bone
of
its
bone
and
flesh
of
its
flesh
and
by
our
secret
sympathy
with
it
we
may
rescind
every
particular
claim
and
dismiss
silently
every
particular
form
of
being
as
something
unreal
and
unholy
an
even
more
cogent
reason
why
benda
god
can
not
have
been
the
creator
of
the
world
is
that
avowedly
this
god
has
never
existed
we
are
expressly
warned
that
if
god
is
infinite
being
he
excludes
existence
in
so
far
as
to
exist
means
to
be
distinct
in
the
sense
which
everybody
attaches
to
the
word
existence
god
as
i
conceive
him
not
of
course
in
the
mind
of
a
lover
of
the
infinite
this
fact
is
not
derogatory
to
god
but
derogatory
to
existence
the
infinite
remains
the
first
and
the
ultimate
term
in
thought
the
fundamental
dimension
common
to
all
things
however
otherwise
they
may
be
qualified
it
remains
the
eternal
background
against
which
they
all
are
defined
and
into
which
they
soon
disappear
evidently
in
this
divine
because
indestructible
and
necessary
dimension
being
is
incapable
of
making
choices
adopting
paths
of
evolution
or
exercising
power
it
knows
nothing
of
phenomena
it
is
not
their
cause
nor
their
sanction
it
is
incapable
of
love
wrath
or
any
other
passion
i
will
add
writes
benda
something
else
which
theories
of
an
impersonal
deity
have
less
often
pointed
out
since
infinity
is
incompatible
with
personal
being
god
is
incapable
of
morality
thus
mere
intuition
and
analysis
of
the
infinite
since
this
infinite
is
itself
passive
and
indifferent
may
prove
a
subtle
antidote
to
passion
to
folly
and
even
to
life
i
think
benda
succeeds
admirably
in
the
purpose
announced
in
his
title
of
rendering
his
discourse
coherent
if
once
we
accept
his
definitions
his
corollaries
follow
clearly
and
bravely
he
disengages
his
idea
of
infinity
from
other
properties
usually
assigned
to
the
deity
such
as
power
omniscience
goodness
and
tutelary
functions
in
respect
to
life
or
to
some
special
human
society
but
coherence
is
not
completeness
nor
even
a
reasonable
measure
of
descriptive
truth
and
certain
considerations
are
omitted
from
benda
view
which
are
of
such
moment
that
if
they
were
included
they
might
transform
the
whole
issue
perhaps
the
chief
of
these
omissions
is
that
of
an
organ
for
thought
benda
throughout
is
engaged
simply
in
clarifying
his
own
ideas
and
repeatedly
disclaims
any
ulterior
pretensions
he
finds
in
the
panorama
of
his
thoughts
an
idea
of
infinite
being
or
god
and
proceeds
to
study
the
relation
of
that
conception
to
all
others
it
is
a
task
of
critical
analysis
and
religious
confession
and
nothing
could
be
more
legitimate
and
to
some
of
us
more
interesting
but
whence
these
various
ideas
and
whence
the
spell
which
the
idea
of
infinite
being
in
particular
casts
over
the
meditative
mind
unless
we
can
view
these
movements
of
thought
in
their
natural
setting
and
order
of
genesis
we
shall
be
in
danger
of
turning
autobiography
into
cosmology
and
inwardness
into
folly
one
of
the
most
notable
points
in
benda
analysis
is
his
insistence
on
the
leap
involved
in
passing
from
infinite
being
to
any
particular
fact
or
system
of
facts
and
again
the
leap
involved
in
passing
when
the
converted
spirit
returns
to
god
from
specific
animal
interests
no
matter
how
generous
social
or
altruistic
these
interests
may
be
to
absolute
renunciation
and
sympathy
with
the
absolute
that
a
will
to
return
to
god
should
arise
in
the
phenomenal
world
seems
to
be
a
miracle
no
less
wonderful
though
it
be
less
wondered
at
than
that
the
world
should
arise
in
the
bosom
of
god
love
of
man
charity
humanitarianism
are
nothing
but
the
selfishness
of
the
race
by
which
each
animal
species
assures
its
specific
existence
to
surrender
one
individuality
for
the
benefit
of
a
larger
self
is
something
quite
different
from
disinterestedness
it
is
the
exact
opposite
and
certainly
if
we
regarded
infinite
being
as
a
cosmological
medium
say
empty
space
and
time
there
would
be
a
miraculous
break
an
unaccountable
new
beginning
if
that
glassy
expanse
was
suddenly
wrinkled
by
something
called
energy
but
in
fact
there
need
never
have
been
such
a
leap
or
such
a
miracle
because
there
could
never
have
been
such
a
transition
infinite
being
is
not
a
material
vacuum
in
the
bosom
of
which
a
world
might
arise
it
is
a
platonic
idea
though
plato
never
entertained
it
an
essence
and
immutable
not
in
the
same
field
of
reality
at
all
as
a
world
of
moving
and
colliding
things
such
an
essence
is
not
conceivably
the
seat
of
the
variations
that
enliven
the
world
it
is
only
in
thought
that
we
may
pass
from
infinite
being
to
an
existing
universe
and
when
we
turn
from
one
to
the
other
and
say
that
now
energy
has
emerged
from
the
bosom
of
god
we
are
turning
over
a
new
leaf
or
rather
picking
up
an
entirely
different
volume
the
natural
world
is
composed
of
objects
and
events
which
theory
may
regard
as
transformations
of
a
hypothetical
energy
an
energy
which
benda
who
when
he
comes
down
to
the
physical
world
is
a
good
materialist
conceives
to
have
condensed
and
distributed
itself
into
matter
which
in
turn
composed
organisms
and
ultimately
generated
consciousness
and
reason
but
in
whatever
manner
the
natural
world
may
have
evolved
it
is
found
and
posited
by
us
in
perception
and
action
not
like
infinite
being
defined
in
thought
this
contrast
is
ontological
and
excludes
any
derivation
of
the
one
object
from
the
other
benda
himself
tells
us
so
and
we
may
wonder
why
he
introduced
infinite
being
at
all
into
his
description
of
the
world
the
reason
doubtless
is
that
he
was
not
engaged
in
describing
the
world
except
by
the
way
but
rather
in
classifying
and
clarifying
his
ideas
in
view
of
determining
his
moral
allegiance
and
he
arranged
his
terms
whether
ideal
or
materials
in
a
single
series
because
they
were
alike
present
to
his
intuition
and
he
was
concerned
to
arrange
them
in
a
hierarchy
according
to
their
moral
dignity
not
only
is
infinite
being
an
incongruous
and
obstructive
term
to
describe
the
substance
of
the
world
which
if
it
subtends
the
changes
in
the
world
and
causes
them
must
evidently
change
with
them
but
even
mathematical
space
and
time
in
their
ideal
infinity
may
be
very
far
from
describing
truly
the
medium
and
groundwork
of
the
universe
that
is
a
question
for
investigation
and
hypothesis
not
for
intuition
but
in
the
life
of
intuition
when
that
life
takes
a
mathematical
turn
empty
space
and
time
and
their
definable
structure
may
be
important
themes
while
when
the
same
life
becomes
a
discipline
of
the
affections
we
see
by
this
latest
example
as
well
as
by
many
a
renowned
predecessor
of
benda
that
infinite
being
may
dominate
the
scene
nor
is
this
eventual
dominance
so
foreign
to
the
natural
mind
or
such
a
miraculous
conversion
as
it
might
seem
here
too
there
is
no
derivation
of
object
from
object
but
an
alternative
for
the
mind
as
benda
points
out
natural
interests
and
sympathies
may
expand
indefinitely
so
as
to
embrace
a
family
a
nation
or
the
whole
animate
universe
we
might
even
be
chiefly
occupied
with
liberal
pursuits
such
as
science
or
music
the
more
we
laboured
at
these
things
and
delighted
in
them
the
less
ready
should
we
be
for
renunciation
and
detachment
must
conversion
then
descend
upon
us
from
heaven
like
a
thunderbolt
far
from
it
we
need
not
look
for
the
principle
of
spiritual
life
in
the
distance
we
have
it
at
home
from
the
beginning
even
the
idea
of
infinite
being
though
unnamed
is
probably
familiar
perhaps
in
the
biography
of
the
human
race
or
of
each
budding
mind
the
infinite
or
indeterminate
may
have
been
the
primary
datum
on
that
homogeneous
sensuous
background
blank
at
first
but
secretly
plastic
a
spot
here
and
a
movement
there
may
gradually
have
become
discernible
until
the
whole
picture
of
nature
and
history
had
shaped
itself
as
we
see
it
a
certain
sense
of
that
primitive
datum
the
infinite
or
indeterminate
may
always
remain
as
it
were
the
outstretched
canvas
on
which
every
picture
is
painted
and
when
the
pictures
vanish
as
in
deep
sleep
the
ancient
simplicity
and
quietness
may
be
actually
recovered
in
a
conscious
union
with
brahma
so
sensuous
so
intimate
so
unsophisticated
the
return
to
god
may
be
for
the
spirit
without
excluding
the
other
avenues
intellectual
and
ascetic
by
which
this
return
may
be
effected
in
waking
life
though
then
not
so
much
in
act
as
in
intent
only
and
allegiance
i
confess
that
formerly
i
had
some
difficulty
in
sharing
the
supreme
respect
for
infinite
being
which
animates
so
many
saints
it
seemed
to
me
the
dazed
the
empty
the
deluded
side
of
spirituality
why
rest
in
an
object
which
can
be
redeemed
from
blank
negation
only
by
a
blank
intensity
but
time
has
taught
me
not
to
despise
any
form
of
vital
imagination
any
discipline
which
may
achieve
perfection
after
any
kind
intuition
is
a
broadly
based
activity
it
engages
elaborate
organs
and
sums
up
and
synthesises
accumulated
impressions
it
may
therefore
easily
pour
the
riches
of
its
ancestry
into
the
image
or
the
sentiment
which
it
evokes
poor
as
this
sentiment
or
image
might
seem
if
expressed
in
words
in
rapt
or
ecstatic
moments
the
vital
momentum
often
the
moral
escape
is
everything
and
the
achievement
apart
from
that
blessed
relief
little
or
nothing
infinite
being
may
profit
in
this
way
by
offering
a
contrast
to
infinite
annoyance
moreover
in
my
own
way
i
have
discerned
in
pure
being
the
involution
of
all
forms
as
felt
pure
being
may
be
indeterminate
but
as
conceived
reflectively
it
includes
all
determinations
so
that
when
deployed
into
the
realm
of
essence
infinite
or
indeterminate
being
truly
contains
entertainment
for
all
eternity
benda
feels
this
pregnancy
of
the
infinite
on
the
mathematical
side
but
he
hardly
notices
the
fact
proclaimed
so
gloriously
by
spinoza
that
the
infinity
of
extension
is
only
one
of
an
infinity
of
infinites
there
is
an
aesthetic
infinite
or
many
aesthetic
infinites
composed
of
all
the
forms
which
nature
or
imagination
might
exhibit
and
where
imagination
fails
there
are
infinite
remainders
of
the
unimagined
the
version
which
benda
gives
us
of
infinite
being
limited
to
the
mathematical
dimension
is
therefore
unnecessarily
cold
and
stark
his
one
infinity
is
monochrome
whereas
the
total
infinity
of
essence
in
which
an
infinity
of
outlines
is
only
one
item
is
infinitely
phenomena
therefore
fall
in
their
essential
variety
within
and
not
without
infinite
being
so
that
in
returning
to
god
we
might
take
the
whole
world
with
us
not
indeed
in
its
blind
movement
and
piecemeal
illumination
as
events
occur
but
in
an
and
panoramic
portrait
as
events
are
gathered
together
in
the
realm
of
truth
on
the
whole
i
think
benda
two
gods
are
less
unfriendly
to
one
another
than
his
aggrieved
tone
might
suggest
this
pregnant
little
book
ends
on
a
tragic
note
hitherto
human
in
the
state
or
the
family
while
serving
the
imperial
god
has
paid
some
grudging
honours
at
least
verbally
to
the
infinite
god
as
well
under
the
guise
of
liberalism
love
of
mankind
or
the
negation
of
classes
but
today
this
imperfect
homage
is
retracted
and
nothing
is
reverenced
except
that
which
gives
strength
if
anyone
preaches
human
kindness
it
is
in
order
to
establish
a
strong
community
martially
trained
like
a
to
oppose
everything
not
included
within
it
and
to
become
omnipotent
in
the
art
of
utilising
the
forces
of
nature
the
will
to
return
to
god
may
prove
to
have
been
in
the
history
of
the
phenomenal
world
a
sublime
accident
certainly
the
will
to
return
to
god
if
not
an
accident
is
an
incident
in
the
life
of
the
world
and
the
whole
world
itself
is
a
sublime
accident
in
the
sense
that
its
existence
is
contingent
groundless
and
precarious
yet
so
long
as
the
imperial
god
continues
successfully
to
keep
our
world
going
it
will
be
no
accident
but
a
natural
necessity
that
many
a
mind
should
turn
to
the
thought
of
the
infinite
with
awe
with
a
sense
of
liberation
and
even
with
joy
the
infinite
god
owes
all
his
worshippers
little
as
he
may
care
for
them
to
the
success
of
the
imperial
god
in
creating
reflective
and
speculative
minds
or
to
drop
these
mythological
expressions
which
may
become
tiresome
philosophers
owe
to
nature
and
to
the
discipline
of
moral
life
their
capacity
to
look
beyond
nature
and
beyond
morality
and
while
they
may
beyond
and
take
comfort
in
the
vision
they
can
not
beyond
as
benda
says
the
most
faithful
levite
can
return
to
the
infinite
only
in
his
thought
in
his
life
he
must
remain
a
lay
creature
yet
nature
in
forming
the
human
soul
unintentionally
unlocked
for
the
mind
the
doors
to
truth
and
to
essence
partly
by
obliging
the
soul
to
attend
to
things
which
are
outside
and
partly
by
endowing
the
soul
with
far
greater
potentialities
of
sensation
and
invention
than
daily
life
is
likely
to
call
forth
our
minds
are
therefore
naturally
dissatisfied
with
their
lot
and
speculatively
directed
upon
an
outspread
universe
in
which
our
persons
count
for
almost
nothing
these
insights
are
calculated
to
give
our
brutal
wills
some
pause
intuition
of
the
infinite
and
recourse
to
the
infinite
for
religious
inspiration
follow
of
themselves
and
can
never
be
suppressed
altogether
so
long
as
life
is
conscious
and
experience
provokes
reflection
spirit
is
certainly
not
one
of
the
forces
producing
spirit
but
neither
is
it
a
contrary
force
it
is
the
actuality
of
feeling
of
observation
of
meaning
spirit
has
no
unmannerly
quarrel
with
its
parents
its
hosts
or
even
its
gaolers
they
know
not
what
they
do
yet
spirit
belongs
intrinsically
to
another
sphere
and
can
not
help
wondering
at
the
world
and
suffering
in
it
the
man
in
whom
spirit
is
awake
will
continue
to
live
and
act
but
with
a
difference
in
so
far
as
he
has
become
pure
spirit
he
will
have
transcended
the
fear
of
death
or
defeat
for
now
his
instinctive
fear
which
will
subsist
will
be
neutralised
by
an
equally
sincere
consent
to
die
and
to
fail
he
will
live
henceforth
in
a
truer
and
more
serene
sympathy
with
nature
than
is
possible
to
rival
natural
beings
natural
beings
are
perpetually
struggling
to
live
only
and
not
to
die
so
that
their
will
is
in
hopeless
rebellion
against
the
divine
decrees
which
they
must
obey
notwithstanding
the
spiritual
man
on
the
contrary
in
so
far
as
he
has
already
passed
intellectually
into
the
eternal
world
no
longer
endures
unwillingly
the
continual
death
involved
in
living
or
the
final
death
involved
in
having
been
born
he
renounces
everything
religiously
in
the
very
act
of
attaining
it
resigning
existence
itself
as
gladly
as
he
accepts
it
or
even
more
gladly
because
the
emphasis
which
action
and
passion
lend
to
the
passing
moment
seems
to
him
arbitrary
and
violent
and
as
each
task
or
experience
is
dismissed
in
turn
he
accounts
the
end
of
it
more
blessed
than
the
beginning
