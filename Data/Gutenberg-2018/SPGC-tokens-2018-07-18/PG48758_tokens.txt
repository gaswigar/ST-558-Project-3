interest
in
american
affairs
revived
plans
for
reaching
the
mer
de
l
ouest
or
pacific
ocean
were
laid
before
the
regent
in
it
was
urged
that
the
best
hope
was
in
sending
an
expedition
across
the
continent
seeing
that
every
attempt
to
find
a
westward
passage
by
hudson
bay
had
failed
as
and
bases
of
supply
for
the
expedition
it
was
proposed
to
establish
three
posts
one
on
the
north
shore
of
lake
superior
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
kaministiguia
another
at
lac
des
cristineaux
now
called
lake
of
the
woods
and
the
third
at
lake
winnipeg
the
last
being
what
in
american
phrase
is
called
the
place
or
the
point
where
the
expedition
was
to
leave
behind
the
last
trace
of
civilization
these
posts
were
to
cost
the
crown
nothing
since
by
a
device
common
in
such
cases
those
who
built
and
maintained
them
were
to
be
paid
by
a
monopoly
of
the
in
the
adjacent
countries
it
was
admitted
however
that
the
subsequent
exploration
must
be
at
the
charge
of
the
government
and
would
require
fifty
good
men
at
three
hundred
francs
a
year
each
besides
equipment
and
supplies
all
things
considered
it
was
reckoned
that
an
overland
way
to
the
pacific
might
be
found
for
about
fifty
thousand
francs
or
ten
thousand
dollars
the
regent
approved
the
scheme
so
far
as
to
order
the
preliminary
step
to
be
taken
by
establishing
the
three
posts
and
in
this
same
year
lieutenant
la
noue
of
the
colony
troops
began
the
work
by
building
a
stockade
at
the
mouth
of
the
kaministiguia
little
more
was
done
in
furtherance
of
the
exploration
till
three
years
later
when
the
celebrated
jesuit
charlevoix
was
ordered
by
the
duke
of
orléans
to
repair
to
america
and
gain
all
possible
information
concerning
the
western
sea
and
the
way
to
it
in
the
next
year
he
went
to
the
upper
lakes
and
questioned
missionaries
officers
and
indians
the
results
were
not
satisfactory
the
missionaries
and
the
officers
had
nothing
to
tell
the
voyagers
and
indians
knew
no
more
than
they
but
invented
confused
and
contradictory
falsehoods
to
hide
their
ignorance
charlevoix
made
note
of
everything
and
reported
to
the
comte
de
toulouse
that
the
pacific
probably
formed
the
western
boundary
of
the
country
of
the
sioux
and
that
some
indians
told
him
that
they
had
been
to
its
shores
and
found
white
men
there
different
from
the
french
believing
that
these
stories
were
not
without
foundation
charlevoix
reported
two
plans
as
likely
to
lead
to
the
coveted
discovery
one
was
to
ascend
the
missouri
the
source
of
which
is
certainly
not
far
from
the
sea
as
all
the
indians
i
have
met
have
unanimously
assured
me
and
the
other
was
to
establish
a
mission
among
the
sioux
from
whom
after
thoroughly
learning
their
language
the
missionaries
could
as
he
thinks
gain
all
the
desired
information
the
regent
approved
the
plan
of
the
mission
but
the
hostile
disposition
of
the
sioux
and
the
outagamies
prevented
its
execution
for
several
years
in
the
scheme
was
revived
and
the
colonial
minister
at
versailles
ordered
the
governor
of
canada
to
send
two
missionaries
to
the
sioux
but
the
mission
required
money
and
the
king
would
not
give
it
hence
the
usual
expedient
was
adopted
a
company
was
formed
and
invested
with
a
monopoly
of
the
sioux
on
condition
of
building
a
fort
and
chapel
and
keeping
an
armed
force
to
guard
them
it
was
specially
provided
that
none
but
pious
and
virtuous
persons
were
to
be
allowed
to
join
the
company
in
order
says
the
document
to
attract
the
benediction
of
god
upon
them
and
their
the
prospects
of
the
company
were
thought
good
and
the
governor
himself
was
one
of
the
shareholders
while
the
mission
was
given
the
most
conspicuous
place
in
the
enterprise
its
objects
were
rather
secular
than
spiritual
to
attach
the
sioux
to
the
french
interest
by
the
double
ties
of
religion
and
trade
and
utilize
their
supposed
knowledge
to
reach
the
pacific
father
guignas
was
made
the
head
of
the
mission
and
boucher
de
la
perrière
the
military
chief
the
party
left

in
june
and
journeying
to

of
michilimackinac
green
bay
fox
river
and
the
wisconsin
went
up
the
great
river
to
lake
pepin
where
the
adventurous
nicolas
perrot
had
built
two
more
than
forty
years
before
even
if
his
tenements
were
still
standing
la
perrière
had
no
thought
of
occupying
them
on
the
north
or
rather
west
side
of
the
lake
his
men
found
a
point
of
land
that
seemed
fit
for
their
purpose
disembarked
cut
down
trees
and
made
a
square
stockade
enclosing
the
necessary
buildings
it
was
near
the
end
of
october
before
they
were
all
well
housed
a
large
band
of
sioux
presently
appeared
and
set
up
their
teepees
hard
by
when
the
birthday
of
the
governor
came
the
party
celebrated
it
with
a
display
of
fireworks
and
vociferous
shouts
of
le
charles
de
while
the
indians
yelped
in
fright
and
amazement
at
the
pyrotechnics
or
stood
pressing
their
hands
upon
their
mouths
in
silent
amazement
the
french
called
their
fort
fort
beauharnois
and
invited
the
aid
of
saint
michael
the
archangel
by
naming
the
mission
in
his
honor
all
went
well
till
april
when
the
water
rose
with
the
spring
floods
and
filled
fort
chapel
and
houses
to
the
depth
of
nearly
three
feet
ejecting
the
whole
party
and
forcing
them
to
encamp
on
higher
ground
till
the
deluge
subsided
worse
enemies
than
the
floods
soon
found
them
out
these
were
the
irrepressible
outagamies
who
rose
against
the
intruding
french
and
incited
the
sioux
to
join
them
there
was
no
profit
for
the
company
and
no
safety
for
its
agents
the
stockholders
became
discouraged
and
would
not
support
the
enterprise
the
fort
was
abandoned
till
in
a
new
arrangement
was
made
followed
by
another
attempt
for
a
time
a
prosperous
trade
was
carried
on
but
as
commonly
happened
in
such
cases
the
adventurers
seem
to
have
thought
more
of
utilizing
their
monopoly
than
of
fulfilling
the
terms
on
which
they
had
received
it
the
wild
sioux
of
the
plains
instead
of
being
converted
and
turned
into
frenchmen
proved
such
dangerous
neighbors
that
in
legardeur
de
who
then
commanded
the
post
found
himself
forced
to
abandon
it
the
enterprise
had
failed
in
both
its
aims
the
western
sea
was
still
a
mystery
and
the
sioux
were
not
friends
but
enemies
legardeur

that
they
should

to

profits
of

of

acres
and
on
these
modest
resources
reinforced
by
an
illicit
trade
in

he
made

to

the
dignity
of

office
his
wife
became
the

of
numerous
offspring
among
whom
was

born
in
an
active
and
hardy
youth
who
like
the
rest
of
the
poor
but
vigorous
canadian
seemed
born
for
the
forest
and
the
when
however
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
broke
out
the
young
man
crossed
the
sea
obtained
the
commission
of
lieutenant
and
was
nearly
killed
at
the
battle
of
malplaquet
where
he
was
shot
through
the
body
received
six
and
was
left
for
dead
on
the
field
he
recovered
and
returned
to
canada
when
finding
his
services
slighted
he
again
took
to
the
woods
he
had
assumed
the
designation
of
la
vérendrye
and
thenceforth
his
full
name
was
pierre
gaultier
de
varennes
de
la
vérendrye
in
he
was
in
command
of
a
small
post
on
lake
nipigon
north
of
lake
superior
here
an
indian
chief
from
the
river
kaministiguia
told
him
of
a
certain
great
lake
which
discharged
itself
by
a
river
flowing
westward
the
indian
further
declared
that
he
had
descended
this
river
till
he
reached
water
that
ebbed
and
flowed
and
terrified
by
the
strange
phenomenon
had
turned
back
though
not
till
he
had
heard
of
a
great
salt
lake
bordered
with
many
villages
other
indians
confirmed
and
improved
the
story
these
people
said
la
vérendrye
to
the
jesuit
degonnor
are
great
liars
but
now
and
then
they
tell
the
it
seemed
to
him
likely
that
their
stories
of
a
western
river
flowing
to
a
western
sea
were
not
totally
groundless
and
that
the
true
way
to
the
pacific
was
not
as
had
been
supposed
through
the
country
of
the
sioux
but
farther
northward
through
that
of
the
cristineaux
and
assiniboins
or
in
other
words
through
the
region
now
called
manitoba
in
this
view
he
was
sustained
by
his
friend
degonnor
who
had
just
returned
from
the
sioux
mission
la
vérendrye
fired
with
the
zeal
of
discovery
offered
to
search
for
the
western
sea
if
the
king
would
give
him
one
hundred
men
and
supply
canoes
arms
and
provisions
but
as
was
usual
in
such
cases
the
king
would
give
nothing
and
though
the
governor
beauharnois
did
all
in
his
power
to
promote
the
enterprise
the
burden
and
the
risk
were
left
to
the
adventurer
himself
la
vérendrye
was
authorized
to
find
a
way
to
the
pacific
at
his
own
expense
in
consideration
of
a
monopoly
of
the
in
the
regions
north
and
west
of
lake
superior
this
vast
and
remote
country
was
held
by
tribes
who
were
doubtful
friends
of
the
french
and
perpetual
enemies
of
each
other
the
risks
of
the
trade
were
as
great
as
its
possible
profits
and
to
reap
these
vast
outlays
must
first
be
made
forts
must
be
built
manned
provisioned
and
stocked
with
goods
brought
through
two
thousand
miles
of
difficult
and
perilous
wilderness
there
were
other
dangers
more
insidious
and
perhaps
greater
the
exclusive
privileges
granted
to
la
vérendrye
would
inevitably
rouse
the
intensest
jealousy
of
the
canadian
merchants
and
they
would
spare
no
effort
to
ruin
him
intrigue
and
calumny
would
be
busy
in
his
absence
if
as
was
likely
his
patron
beauharnois
should
be
recalled
the
new
governor
might
be
turned
against
him
his
privileges
might
be
suddenly
revoked
the
forts
he
had
built
passed
over
to
his
rivals
and
all
his
outlays
turned
to
their
profit
as
had
happened
to
la
salle
on
the
recall
of
his
patron
frontenac
on
the
other
hand
the
country
was
full
of
the
choicest
furs
which
the
indians
had
hitherto
carried
to
the
english
at
hudson
bay
but
which
the
proposed
would
secure
to
the
french
la
vérendrye
s
enemies
pretended
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
and
slighted
the
discovery
which
he
had
bound
himself
to
undertake
but
his
conduct
proves
that
he
was
true
to
his
engagements
and
that
ambition
to
gain
honorable
distinction
in
the
service
of
the
king
had
a
large
place
among
the
motives
that
impelled
him
as
his
own
resources
were
of
the
smallest
he
took
a
number
of
associates
on
conditions
most
unfavorable
to
himself
among
them
they
raised
money
enough
to
begin
the
enterprise
and
on
the
eighth
of
june
la
vérendrye
and
three
of
his
sons
together
with
his
nephew
la
jemeraye
the
jesuit
messager
and
a
party
of
canadians
set
out
from
montreal
it
was
late
in
august
before
they
reached
the
great
portage
of
lake
superior
which
led
across
the
height
of
land
separating
the
waters
of
that
lake
from
those
flowing
to
lake
winnipeg
the
way
was
long
and
difficult
the
men
who
had
perhaps
been
tampered
with
mutinied
and
refused
to
go
farther
some
of
them
with
much
ado
consented
at
last
to
proceed
and
under
the
lead
of
la
jemeraye
made
their
way
by
an
intricate
and
broken
chain
of
lakes
and
streams
to
rainy
lake
where
they
built
a
fort
and
called
it
fort
pierre
la
vérendrye
was
forced
to
winter
with
the
rest
of
the
party
at
the
river
kaministiguia
not
far
from
the
great
portage
here
months
were
lost
during
which
a
crew
of
useless
mutineers
had
to
be
fed
and
paid
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
june
that
he
could
get
them
again
into
motion
towards
lake
winnipeg
this
ominous
beginning
was
followed
by
a
train
of
disasters
his
associates
abandoned
him
the
merchants
on
whom
he
depended
for
supplies
would
not
send
them
and
he
found
himself
in
his
own
words
destitute
of
his
nephew
la
jemeraye
died
the
jesuit
auneau
bent
on
returning
to
michilimackinac
set
out
with
la
vérendrye
s
eldest
son
and
a
party
of
twenty
canadians
a
few
days
later
they
were
all
found
on
an
island
in

the

mortal
foes
of
that
fierce
people
offered
to
join
the
french
and
avenge
the
butchery
but
a
war
with
the

would
have
ruined
la

s
plans
of
discovery
and
exposed
to
torture
and
death
the
french
traders
in
their
country
therefore
he
restrained
himself
and
declined
the
proffered
aid
at
the
risk
of
incurring
the
contempt
of
those
who
offered
it
beauharnois
twice
appealed
to
the
court
to
give
la
vérendrye
some
little
aid
urging
that
he
was
at
the
end
of
his
resources
and
that
a
grant
of
thirty
thousand
francs
or
six
thousand
dollars
would
enable
him
to
find
a
way
to
the
pacific
all
help
was
refused
but
la
vérendrye
was
told
that
he
might
let
out
his
forts
to
other
traders
and
so
raise
means
to
pursue
the
discovery
in
he
went
for
the
third
time
to
montreal
where
instead
of
aid
he
found
a
lawsuit
in
spite
he
says
of
the
derangement
of
my
affairs
the
envy
and
jealousy
of
various
persons
impelled
them
to
write
letters
to
the
court
insinuating
that
i
thought
of
nothing
but
making
my
fortune
if
more
than
forty
thousand
livres
of
debt
which
i
have
on
my
shoulders
are
an
advantage
then
i
can
flatter
myself
that
i
am
very
rich
in
all
my
misfortunes
i
have
the
consolation
of
seeing
that
de
beauharnois
enters
into
my
views
recognizes
the
uprightness
of
my
intentions
and
does
me
justice
in
spite
of
meanwhile
under
all
his
difficulties
he
had
explored
a
vast
region
hitherto
unknown
diverted
a
great
and
lucrative
from
the
english
at
hudson
bay
and
secured
possession
of
it
by
six
fortified
posts
fort
pierre
on
rainy
lake
fort
charles
on
the
lake
of
the
woods
fort
maurepas
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
winnipeg
fort
bourbon
on
the
eastern
side
of
lake
winnipeg
fort
la
reine
on
the
assiniboin
fort
dauphin
on
lake
manitoba
besides
these
he
built
another
post
called
fort
rouge
on
the
site
of
the
city
of
winnipeg
and
some
time
after
another
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
poskoiac
or
saskatchewan
neither
of
which
however
was
long
occupied
these
various
forts
were
only
stockade
works
flanked
with
blockhouses
but
the
difficulty
of
building
and
maintaining
them
in
this
remote
wilderness
was
incalculable
he
had
inquired
on
all
sides
for
the
pacific
the
assiniboins
could
tell
him
nothing
nor
could
any
information
be
expected
from
them
since
their
relatives
and
mortal
enemies
the
sioux
barred
their
way
to
the
west
the
cristineaux
were
equally
ignorant
but
they
supplied
the
place
of
knowledge
by
invention
and
drew
maps
some
of
which
seem
to
have
been
made
with
no
other
intention
than
that
of
amusing
themselves
by
imposing
on
the
inquirer
they
also
declared
that
some
of
their
number
had
gone
down
a
river
called
white
river
or
river
of
the
west
where
they
found
a
plant
that
shed
drops
like
blood
and
saw
serpents
of
prodigious
size
they
said
further
that
on
the
lower
part
of
this
river
were
walled
towns
where
dwelt
white
men
who
had
knives
hatchets
and
cloth
but
no
firearms
both
assiniboins
and
cristineaux
declared
that
there
was
a
distant
tribe
on
the
missouri
called
mantannes
mandans
who
knew
the
way
to
the
western
sea
and
would
guide
him
to
it
lured
by
this
assurance
and
feeling
that
he
had
sufficiently
secured
his
position
to
enable
him
to
begin
his
western
exploration
la
vérendrye
left
fort
la
reine
in
october
with
twenty
men
and
pushed
up
the
river
assiniboin
till
its
rapids
and
shallows
threatened
his
bark
canoes
with
destruction
then
with
a
band
of
assiniboin
indians
who
had
joined
him
he
struck
across
the
prairie
for
the
mandans
his
indian
companions
hunting
buffalo
on
the
way
they
approached
the
first
mandan
village
on
the
afternoon
of
the
third
of
december
displaying
a
french
flag
and
firing
three
volleys
as
a
salute
the
whole
population
poured
out
to
see
the
marvellous
visitors
who
were
conducted
through
the
staring
crowd
to
the
lodge
of
the
principal
chief
a
capacious
structure
so
thronged
with
the
naked
and
greasy
savages
that
the
frenchmen
were
half
smothered
what
was
worse
they
lost
the
bag
that
held
all
their
presents
for
the
mandans
which
was
snatched
away
in
the
confusion
and
hidden
in
one
of
the
called
cellars
by
la
vérendrye
of
which
the
place
was
full
the
chief
seemed
much
discomposed
at
this
mishap
and
explained
it
by
saying
that
there
were
many
rascals
in
the
village
the
loss
was
serious
since
without
the
presents
nothing
could
be
done
nor
was
this
all
for
in
the
morning
la
vérendrye
missed
his
interpreter
and
was
told
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
an
assiniboin
girl
and
gone
off
in
pursuit
of
her
the
french
were
now
without
any
means
of
communicating
with
the
mandans
from
whom
however
before
the
disappearance
of
the
interpreter
they
had
already
received
a
variety
of
questionable
information
chiefly
touching
white
men
cased
in
iron
who
were
said
to
live
on
the
river
below
at
the
distance
of
a
whole
summer
s
journey
as
they
were
impervious
to
arrows
so
the
story
ran
it
was
necessary
to
shoot
their
horses
after
which
being
too
heavy
to
run
they
were
easily
caught
this
was
probably
suggested
by
the
armor
of
the
spaniards
who
had
more
than
once
made
incursions
as
far
as
the
lower
missouri
but
the
narrators
drew
on
their
imagination
for
various
additional
particulars
the
mandans
seem
to
have
much
declined
in
numbers
during
the
century
that
followed
this
visit
of
la
vérendrye
he
says
that
they
had
six
villages
on
or
near
the
missouri
of
which
the
one
seen
by
him
was
the
smallest
though
he
thinks
that
it
contained
a
hundred
and
thirty
houses
as
each
of
these
large
structures
held
a
number
of
families
the
population
must
have
been
considerable
yet
when
prince
maximilian
visited
the
mandans
in
he
found
only
two
villages
containing
jointly
two
hundred
and
forty
warriors
and
a
total
population
of
about
a
thousand
souls
without
having
seen
the
statements
of
la
vérendrye
he
speaks
of
the
population
as
greatly
reduced
by
wars
and
the
a
disease
which
a
few
years
later
nearly
exterminated
the
tribe
la
vérendrye
represents
the
six
villages
as
surrounded
with
ditches
and
stockades
flanked
by
a
sort
of
bastion
defences
which
he
says
had
nothing
savage
in
their
construction
in
later
times
the
fortifications
were
of
a
much
ruder
kind
though
maximilian
represents
them
as
having
pointed
salients
to
serve
as
bastions
la
vérendrye
mentions
some
peculiar
customs
of
the
mandans
which
answer
exactly
to
those
described
by
more
recent
observers
he
had
intended
to
winter
with
the
tribe
but
the
loss
of
the
presents
and
the
interpreter
made
it
useless
to
stay
and
leaving
two
men
in
the
village
to
learn
the
language
he
began
his
return
to
fort
la
reine
i
was
very
ill
he
writes
but
hoped
to
get
better
on
the
way
the
reverse
was
the
case
for
it
was
the
depth
of
winter
it
would
be
impossible
to
suffer
more
than
i
did
it
seemed
that
nothing
but
death
could
release
us
from
such
he
reached
fort
la
reine
on
the
eleventh
of
february
his
iron
constitution
seems
to
have
been
severely
shaken
but
he
had
sons
worthy
of
their
father
the
two
men
left
among
the
mandans
appeared
at
fort
la
reine
in
september
they
reported
that
they
had
been
well
treated
and
that
their
hosts
had
parted
from
them
with
regret
they
also
declared
that
at
the
end
of
spring
several
indian
tribes
all
well
supplied
with
horses
had
come
as
was
their
yearly
custom
to
the
mandan
villages
to
barter
embroidered
buffalo
hides
and
other
skins
for
corn
and
beans
that
they
had
encamped
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
lodges
on
the
farther
side
of
the
missouri
and
that
among
them
was
a
band
said
to
have
come
from
a
distant
country
towards
the
sunset
where
there
were
white
men
who
lived
in
houses
built
of
bricks
and
stones
the
two
frenchmen
crossed
over
to
the
camp
of
these
western
strangers
among
whom
they
found
a
chief
who
spoke
or
professed
to
speak
the
language
of
the
mysterious
white
men
which
to
the
two
frenchmen
was
unintelligible
fortunately
he
also
spoke
the
language
of
the
mandans
of
which
the
frenchmen
had
learned
a
little
during
their
stay
and
hence
were
able
to
gather
that
the
white
men
in
question
had
beards
and
that
they
prayed
to
the
master
of
life
in
great
houses
built
for
the
purpose
holding
books
the
leaves
of
which
were
like
husks
of
indian
corn
singing
together
and
repeating
the
chief
gave
many
other
particulars
which
seemed
to
show
that
he
had
been
in
contact
with
spaniards
probably
those
of
california
for
he
described
their
houses
as
standing
near
the
great
lake
of
which
the
water
rises
and
falls
and
is
not
fit
to
drink
he
invited
the
two
frenchmen
to
go
with
him
to
this
strange
country
saying
that
it
could
be
reached
before
winter
though
a
wide
circuit
must
be
made
to
avoid
a
fierce
and
dangerous
tribe
called
snake
indians
du
on
hearing
this
story
la
vérendrye
sent
his
eldest
son
pierre
to
pursue
the
discovery
with
two
men
ordering
him
to
hire
guides
among
the
mandans
and
make
his
way
to
the
western
sea
but
no
guides
were
to
be
found
and
in
the
next
summer
the
young
man
returned
from
his
bootless
errand
undaunted
by
this
failure
pierre
set
out
again
in
the
next
spring
with
his
younger
brother
the
chevalier
de
la
vérendrye
accompanied
only
by
two
canadians
they
left
fort
la
reine
on
the
of
april
and
following
no
doubt
the
route
of
the
assiniboin
and
mouse
river
reached
the
chief
village
of
the
mandans
in
about
three
weeks
here
they
found
themselves
the
welcome
guests
of
this
singularly
interesting
tribe
ruined
by
the
nearly
half
a
century
ago
but
preserved
to
memory
by
the
skilful
pencil
of
the
artist
charles
bodmer
and
the
brush
of
the
painter
george
catlin
both
of
whom
saw
them
at
a
time
when
they
were
little
changed
in
habits
and
manners
since
the
visit
of
the
brothers
la
vérendrye
thus
though
the
report
of
the
two
brothers
is
too
concise
and
brief
we
know
what
they
saw
when
they
entered
the
central
area
or
public
square
of
the
village
around
stood
the
mandan
lodges
looking
like
round
flattened
hillocks
of
earth
forty
or
fifty
feet
wide
on
examination
they
proved
to
be
framed
of
strong
posts
and
poles
covered
with
a
thick
matting
of
intertwined
over
which
was
laid
a
bed
of
clay
or
earth
two
or
three
feet
thick
this
heavy
roof
was
supported
by
strong
interior
posts
the
open
place
which
the
dwellings
enclosed
served
for
games
dances
and
the
ghastly
religious
or
magical
ceremonies
practised
by
the
tribe
among
the
other
structures
was
the
sacred
medicine
lodge
distinguished
by
three
or
four
tall
poles
planted
before
it
each
surmounted
by
an
effigy
looking
much
like
a
scarecrow
and
meant
as
an
offering
to
the
spirits
if
the
two
travellers
had
been
less
sparing
of
words
they
would
doubtless
have
told
us
that
as
they
entered
the
village
square
the
flattened
earthen
domes
that
surrounded
it
were
thronged
with
squaws
and
children
for
this
was
always
the
case
on
occasions
of
public
interest
and
that
they
were
forced
to
undergo
a
merciless
series
of
feasts
in
the
lodges
of
the
chiefs
here
seated
by
the
sunken
hearth
in
the
middle
under
the
large
hole
in
the
roof
that
served
both
for
window
and
chimney
they
could
study
at
their
ease
the
domestic
economy
of
their
entertainers
each
lodge
held
a
or
family
connection
whose
beds
of
raw
buffalo
hide
stretched
on
poles
were
ranged
around
the
circumference
of
the
building
while
by
each
stood
a
post
on
which
hung
shields
lances
bows
quivers
and
masks
formed
of
the
skin
of
a
buffalo
s
head
with
the
horns
attached
to
be
used
in
the
magic
buffalo
dance
every
day
had
its
sports
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
savage
existence
the
game
of
the
stick
and
the
rolling
ring
the
archery
practice
of
boys
on
the
neighboring
prairie
and
incessant
games
of
chance
while
every
evening
in
contrast
to
these
gayeties
the
long
dismal
wail
of
women
rose
from
the
adjacent
cemetery
where
the
dead
of
the
village
sewn
fast
in
buffalo
hides
lay
on
scaffolds
above
the
reach
of
wolves
illustration
parts
of
montana
and
north
dakota
showing
approximately
the
route
of
chevalier
de
la
vérendrye
in
the
mandans
did
not
know
the
way
to
the
pacific
but
they
told
the
brothers
that
they
expected
a
speedy
visit
from
a
tribe
or
band
called
horse
indians
who
could
guide
them
thither
it
is
impossible
to
identify
this
people
with
any
certainty
the
two
travellers
waited
for
them
in
vain
till
after
midsummer
and
then
as
the
season
was
too
far
advanced
for
longer
delay
they
hired
two
mandans
to
conduct
them
to
their
customary
haunts
they
set
out
on
horseback
their
scanty
baggage
and
their
stock
of
presents
being
no
doubt
carried
by
their
general
course
was
with
the
black
hills
at
a
distance
on
their
left
and
the
upper
missouri
on
their
right
the
country
was
a
rolling
prairie
well
covered
for
the
most
part
with
grass
and
watered
by
small
alkaline
streams
creeping
towards
the
missouri
with
an
opaque
whitish
current
except
along
the
watercourses
there
was
little
or
no
wood
i
noticed
says
the
chevalier
de
la
vérendrye
earths
of
different
colors
blue
green
red
or
black
white
as
chalk
or
yellowish
like
this
was
probably
in
the
bad
lands
of
the
little
missouri
where
these
colored
earths
form
a
conspicuous
feature
in
the
bare
and
barren
bluffs
carved
into
fantastic
shapes
by
the
storms
for
twenty
days
the
travellers
saw
no
human
being
so
scanty
was
the
population
of
these
plains
game
however
was
abundant

from
the
tall
reedy

of
the

by

distant

approached
with
the
curiosity
of
their
species
to
gaze
at
the
passing
horsemen
then
fled
like
the
wind
and
as
they
neared
the
broken
uplands
towards
the
yellowstone
they
saw
troops
of
elk
and
flocks
of
sometimes
for
miles
together
the
dry
plain
was
studded
thick
with
the
earthen
mounds
that
marked
the
burrows
of
the
curious
marmots
called
from
their
squeaking
bark
wolves
white
and
gray
howled
about
the
camp
at
night
and
their
cousin
the
coyote
seated
in
the
dusk
of
evening
upright
on
the
grass
with
nose
turned
to
the
sky
saluted
them
with
a
complication
of
yelpings
as
if
a
score
of
petulant
voices
were
pouring
together
from
the
throat
of
one
small
beast
on
the
eleventh
of
august
after
a
march
of
about
three
weeks
the
brothers
reached
a
hill
or
group
of
hills
apparently
west
of
the
little
missouri
and
perhaps
a
part
of
the
powder
river
range
it
was
here
that
they
hoped
to
find
the
horse
indians
but
nobody
was
to
be
seen
arming
themselves
with
patience
they
built
a
hut
made
fires
to
attract
by
the
smoke
any
indians
roaming
near
and
went
every
day
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
to
reconnoitre
at
length
on
the
fourteenth
of
september
they
descried
a
spire
of
smoke
on
the
distant
prairie
one
of
their
mandan
guides
had
left
them
and
gone
back
to
his
village
the
other
with
one
of
the
frenchmen
went
towards
the
smoke
and
found
a
camp
of
indians
whom
the
journal
calls
les
beaux
hommes
and
who
were
probably
crows
or
apsaroka
a
tribe
remarkable
for
stature
and
symmetry
who
long
claimed
that
region
as
their
own
they
treated
the
visitors
well
and
sent
for
the
other
frenchmen
to
come
to
their
lodges
where
they
were
received
with
great
rejoicing
the
remaining
mandan
however
became
frightened
for
the
beaux
hommes
were
enemies
of
his
tribe
and
he
soon
followed
his
companion
on
his
solitary
march
homeward
the
brothers
remained
days
in
the
camp
of
the
beaux
hommes
much
perplexed
for
want
of
an
interpreter
the
tribes
of
the
plains
have
in
common
a
system
of
signs
by
which
they
communicate
with
each
other
and
it
is
likely
that
the
brothers
had
learned
it
from
the
sioux
or
assiniboins
with
whom
they
had
been
in
familiar
intercourse
by
this
or
some
other
means
they
made
their
hosts
understand
that
they
wished
to
find
the
horse
indians
and
the
beaux
hommes
being
soothed
by
presents
offered
some
of
their
young
men
as
guides
they
set
out
on
the
ninth
of
october
following
a
course
in
two
days
they
met
a
band
of
indians
called
by
them
the
little
foxes
and
on
the
fifteenth
and
seventeenth
two
villages
of
another
unrecognizable
horde
named
pioya
from
la
vérendrye
s
time
to
our
own
this
name
villages
has
always
been
given
to
the
encampments
of
the
wandering
people
of
the
plains
all
these
nomadic
communities
joined
them
and
they
moved
together
southward
till
they
reached
at
last
the
lodges
of
the
horse
indians
they
found
them
in
the
extremity
of
distress
and
terror
their
camp
resounded
with
howls
and
wailings
and
not
without
cause
for
the
snakes
or
shoshones
a
formidable
people
living
farther
westward
had
lately
destroyed
most
of
their
tribe
the
snakes
were
the
terror
of
that
country
the
brothers
were
told
that
the
year
before
they
had
destroyed
seventeen
villages
killing
the
warriors
and
old
women
and
carrying
off
the
young
women
and
children
as
slaves
none
of
the
horse
indians
had
ever
seen
the
pacific
but
they
knew
a
people
called
gens
de
l
arc
or
bow
indians
who
as
they
said
had
traded
not
far
from
it
to
the
bow
indians
therefore
the
brothers
resolved
to
go
and
by
dint
of
gifts
and
promises
they
persuaded
their
hosts
to
show
them
the
way
after
marching
southwestward
for
several
days
they
saw
the
distant
prairie
covered
with
the
pointed
lodges
of
a
great
indian
camp
it
was
that
of
the
bow
indians
who
may
have
been
one
of
the
bands
of
the
western
sioux
the
predominant
race
in
this
region
few
or
none
of
them
could
ever
have
seen
a
white
man
and
we
may
imagine
their
amazement
at
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
who
followed
by
staring
crowds
were
conducted
to
the
lodge
of
the
chief
thus
far
says
la
vérendrye
we
had
been
well
received
in
all
the
villages
we
had
passed
but
this
was
nothing
compared
with
the
courteous
manners
of
the
great
chief
of
the
bow
indians
who
unlike
the
others
was
not
in
the
least
and
who
took
excellent
care
of
everything
belonging
to
the
first
inquiry
of
the
travellers
was
for
the
pacific
but
neither
the
chief
nor
his
tribesmen
knew
anything
of
it
except
what
they
had
heard
from
snake
prisoners
taken
in
war
the
frenchmen
were
surprised
at
the
extent
of
the
camp
which
consisted
of
many
separate
bands
the
chief
explained
that
they
had
been
summoned
from
far
and
near
for
a
grand
against
that
common
foe
of
all
the
snakes
in
fact
the
camp
resounded
with
and
come
with
us
said
their
host
we
are
going
towards
the
mountains
where
you
can
see
the
great
water
that
you
are
looking
at
length
the
camp
broke
up
the
squaws
took
down
the
lodges
and
the
march
began
over
prairies
dreary
and
brown
with
the
withering
touch
of
autumn
the
spectacle
was
such
as
men
still
young
have
seen
in
these
western
lands
but
which
no
man
will
see
again
the
vast
plain
swarmed
with
the
moving
multitude
the
tribes
of
the
missouri
and
the
yellowstone
had
by
this
time
abundance
of
horses
the
best
of
which
were
used
for
war
and
hunting
and
the
others
as
beasts
of
burden
these
last
were
equipped
in
a
peculiar
manner
several
of
the
long
poles
used
to
frame
the
teepees
or
lodges
were
secured
by
one
end
to
each
side
of
a
rude
saddle
while
the
other
end
trailed
on
the
ground
crossbars
lashed
to
the
poles
just
behind
the
horse
kept
them
three
or
four
feet
apart
and
formed
a
firm
support
on
which
was
laid
compactly
folded
the
covering
of
the
lodge
on
this
again
sat
a
mother
with
her
young
family
sometimes
stowed
for
safety
in
a
large
open
willow
basket
with
the
occasional
addition
of
some
domestic
pet
such
as
a
tame
raven
a
puppy
or
even
a
small
other
horses
were
laden
in
the
same
manner
with
wooden
bowls
stone
hammers
and
other
utensils
along
with
stores
of
dried
packed
in
cases
of
rawhide
whitened
and
painted
many
of
the
innumerable
dogs
whose
manners
and
appearance
strongly
suggested
their
relatives
the
wolves
to
whom
however
they
bore
a
mortal
grudge
were
equipped
in
a
similar
way
with
shorter
poles
and
lighter
loads
bands
of
naked
boys
noisy
and
restless
roamed
the
prairie
practising
their
bows
and
arrows
on
any
small
animal
they
might
find
gay
young
squaws
adorned
on
each
cheek
with
a
spot
of
ochre
or
red
clay
and
arrayed
in
tunics
of
fringed
buckskin
embroidered
with
porcupine
quills
were
mounted
on
ponies
astride
like
men
while
lean
and
tattered
hags
the
drudges
of
the
tribe
unkempt
and
hideous
scolded
the
lagging
horses
or
screeched
at
the
disorderly
dogs
with
voices
not
unlike
the
yell
of
the
great
horned
owl
most
of
the
warriors
were
on
horseback
armed
with
round
white
shields
of
feathered
lances
bows
and
quivers
filled
with
arrows
while
a
few
of
the
elders
wrapped
in
robes
of
stalked
along
in
groups
with
a
stately
air
chatting
laughing
and
exchanging
unseemly
jokes
we
continued
our
march
says
la
vérendrye
sometimes
and
now
and
then
northwest
our
numbers
constantly
increasing
by
villages
of
different
tribes
which
joined
the
variations
of
their
course
were
probably
due
to
the
difficulties
of
the
country
which
grew
more
rugged
as
they
advanced
with
broken
hills
tracts
of
dingy
green
and
bright
swift
streams
edged
with
cottonwood
and
willow
hurrying
northward
to
join
the
yellowstone
at
length
on
the
first
of
january
they
saw
what
was
probably
the
bighorn
range
of
the
rocky
mountains
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
east
of
the
yellowstone
park
a
council
of
all
the
allied
bands
was
now
called
and
the
frenchmen
were
asked
to
take
part
in
it
the
questions
discussed
were
how
to
dispose
of
the
women
and
children
and
how
to
attack
the
enemy
having
settled
their
plans
the
chiefs
begged
their
white
friends
not
to
abandon
them
and
the
younger
of
the
two
the
chevalier
consented
to
join
the
warriors
and
aid
them
with
advice
though
not
with
arms
the
tribes
of
the
western
plains
rarely
go
on
in
winter
and
this
great
expedition
must
have
been
the
result
of
unusual
exasperation
the
object
was
to
surprise
the
snakes
in
the
security
of
their
winter
camp
and
strike
a
deadly
blow
which
would
have
been
impossible
in
summer
on
the
eighth
of
january
the
whole
body
stopped
to
encamp
choosing
no
doubt
after
the
invariable
winter
custom
of
western
indians
a
place
sheltered
from
wind
and
supplied
with
water
and
fuel
here
the
squaws
and
children
were
to
remain
while
most
of
the
warriors
advanced
against
the
enemy
by
pegging
the
lower
edge
of
the
to
the
ground
and
piling
a
ridge
of
stones
and
earth
upon
it
to
keep
out
the
air
fastening
with
wooden
skewers
the
flap
of
hide
that
covered
the
entrance
and
keeping
a
constant
fire
they
could
pass
a
winter
endurable
to
indians
though
smoke
filth
vermin
bad
air
the
crowd
and
the
total
absence
of
privacy
would
make
it
a
purgatory
to
any
civilized
white
man
the
chevalier
left
his
brother
to
watch
over
the
baggage
of
the
party
which
was
stored
in
the
lodge
of
the
great
chief
while
he
himself
with
his
two
canadians
joined
the
advancing
warriors
they
were
on
horseback
marching
with
a
certain
order
and
sending
watchmen
to
reconnoitre
the
country
from
the
tops
of
the
hills
their
movements
were
so
slow
that
it
was
twelve
days
before
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountains
which
says
la
vérendrye
are
for
the
most
part
well
wooded
and
seem
very
he
longed
to
climb
their
great
peaks
fancying
that
he
might
then
see
the
pacific
and
never
dreaming
that
more
than
eight
hundred
miles
of
mountains
and
forests
still
lay
between
him
and
his
goal
through
the
whole
of
the
present
century
the
villages
of
the
snakes
were
at
a
considerable
distance
west
of
the
bighorn
range
and
some
of
them
were
even
on
the
upper
waters
of
the
pacific
slope
it
is
likely
that
they
were
so
in
in
which
case
the
would
not
have
only
reached
the
bighorn
mountains
but
have
pushed
farther
on
to
within
sight
of
the
great
wind
river
range
be
this
as
it
may
their
scouts
reached
the
chief
winter
camp
of
the
snakes
and
found
it
abandoned
with
lodges
still
standing
and
many
household
possessions
left
behind
the
enemy
had
discovered
their
approach
and
fled
instead
of
encouraging
the
allies
this
news
filled
them
with
terror
for
they
feared
that
the
snake
warriors
might
make
a
circuit
to
the
rear
and
fall
upon
the
camp
where
they
had
left
their
women
and
children
the
great
chief
spent
all
his
eloquence
in
vain
nobody
would
listen
to
him
and
with
characteristic
fickleness
they
gave
over
the
enterprise
and
retreated
in
a
panic
our
advance
was
made
in
good
order
but
not
so
our
retreat
says
the
chevalier
s
journal
everybody
fled
his
own
way
our
horses
though
good
were
very
tired
and
got
little
to
the
chevalier
was
one
day
riding
with
his
friend
the
great
chief
when
looking
behind
him
he
missed
his
two
french
attendants
hastening
back
in
alarm
he
found
them
far
in
the
rear
quietly
feeding
their
horses
under
the
shelter
of
a
clump
of
trees
he
had
scarcely
joined
them
when
he
saw
a
party
of
fifteen
hostile
indians
stealthily
creeping
forward
covered
by
their
shields
he
and
his
men
let
them
approach
and
then
gave
them
a
few
shots
on
which
they
immediately
ran
off
firearms
being
to
them
an
astounding
novelty
the
three
frenchmen
now
tried
to
rejoin
the
great
chief
and
his
band
but
the
task
was
not
easy
the
prairie
bare
of
snow
and
hard
as
flint
showed
no
trace
of
foot
or
hoof
and
it
was
by
rare
good
fortune
that
they
succeeded
on
the
second
day
not
in
overtaking
the
chief
but
in
reaching
the
camp
where
the
women
and
children
had
been
left
they
found
them
all
in
safety
the
snakes
had
not
attacked
them
and
the
panic
of
the
warriors
was
needless
it
was
the
ninth
of
february
they
were
scarcely
housed
when
a
blizzard
set
in
and
on
the
night
of
the
tenth
the
plains
were
buried
in
snow
the
great
chief
had
not
appeared
with
such
of
his
warriors
as
he
could
persuade
to
follow
him
he
had
made
a
wide
circuit
to
find
the
trail
of
the
lost
frenchmen
but
to
his
great
distress
had
completely
failed
it
was
not
till
five
days
after
the
arrival
of
the
chevalier
and
his
men
that
the
chief
reached
the
camp
more
dead
than
alive
in
the
words
of
the
journal
all
his
hardships
were
forgotten
when
he
found
his
white
friends
safe
for
he
had
given
them
up
for
lost
his
sorrow
turned
to
joy
and
he
could
not
give
us
attention
and
caresses
the
camp
broke
up
and
the
allied
bands
dispersed
the
great
chief
and
his
followers
moved
slowly
through
the
snowdrifts
towards
the
accompanied
by
the
frenchmen
thus
they
kept
on
till
the
first
of
march
when
the
two
brothers
learning
that
they
were
approaching
the
winter
village
of
a
people
called
gens
de
la
petite
cerise
or
indians
sent
one
of
their
men
with
a
guide
to
visit
them
the
man
returned
in
ten
days
bringing
a
message
from
the
indians
inviting
the
frenchmen
to
their
lodges
the
great
chief
of
the
bow
indians
who
seems
to
have
regarded
his
young
friends
with
mingled
affection
respect
and
wonder
was
grieved
at
the
thought
of
losing
them
but
took
comfort
when
they
promised
to
visit
him
again
provided
that
he
would
make
his
abode
near
a
certain
river
which
they
pointed
out
to
this
he
readily
agreed
and
then
with
mutual
regret
they
parted
the
frenchmen
repaired
to
the
village
of
the
indians
who
like
the
bow
indians
were
probably
a
band
of
sioux
hard
by
their
lodges
which
stood
near
the
missouri
the
brothers
buried
a
plate
of
lead
graven
with
the
royal
arms
and
raised
a
pile
of
stones
in
honor
of
the
governor
of
canada
they
remained
at
this
place
till
april
then
mounting
their
horses
again
followed
the
missouri
upward
to
the
village
of
the
mandans
which
they
reached
on
the
eighteenth
of
may
after
spending
a
week
here
they
joined
a
party
of
assiniboins
journeyed
with
them
towards
fort
la
reine
and
reached
it
on
the
second
of
july
to
the
great
relief
of
their
father
who
was
waiting
in
suspense
having
heard
nothing
of
them
for
more
than
a
year
years
later
when
the
vast
western
regions
then
called
louisiana
had
just
been
ceded
to
the
united
states
captains
lewis
and
clark
left
the
mandan
villages
with
men
traced
the
missouri
to
the
mountains
penetrated
the
wastes
beyond
and
made
their
way
to
the
pacific
the
first
stages
of
that
remarkable
exploration
were
anticipated
by
the
brothers
la
vérendrye
they
did
not
find
the
pacific
but
they
discovered
the
rocky
mountains
or
at
least
the
part
of
them
to
which
the
name
properly
belongs
for
the
southern
continuation
of
the
great
range
had
long
been
known
to
the
spaniards
their
bold
adventure
was
achieved
not
at
the
charge
of
a
government
but
at
their
own
cost
and
that
of
their
father
not
with
a
band
of
men
but
with
only
two
followers
the
privilege
which
was
to
have
been
their
compensation
had
proved
their
ruin
they
were
still
pursued
without
ceasing
by
the
jealousy
of
rival
traders
and
the
ire
of
disappointed
partners
here
in
canada
more
than
anywhere
else
the
chevalier
wrote
some
years
after
his
return
envy
is
the
passion
la
and
there
is
no
escaping
it
was
the
story
of
la
salle
repeated
beauharnois
however
still
stood
by
them
encouraged
and
defended
them
and
wrote
in
their
favor
to
the
colonial
minister
it
was
doubtless
through
his
efforts
that
the
elder
la
vérendrye
was
at
last
promoted
to
a
captaincy
in
the
colony
troops
beauharnois
was
succeeded
in
the
government
by
the
sagacious
and
able
galissonière
and
he
too
befriended
the
explorers
it
seems
to
me
he
wrote
to
the
minister
that
what
you
have
been
told
touching
the
sieur
de
la
vérendrye
to
the
effect
that
he
has
been
more
busy
with
his
own
interests
than
in
making
discoveries
is
totally
false
and
moreover
that
any
officers
employed
in
such
work
will
always
be
compelled
to
give
some
of
their
attention
to
trade
so
long
as
the
king
allows
them
no
other
means
of
subsistence
these
discoveries
are
very
costly
and
more
fatiguing
and
dangerous
than
open
two
years
later
the
elder
la
vérendrye
received
the
cross
of
the
order
of
louis
an
honor
much
prized
in
canada
but
which
he
did
not
long
enjoy
for
he
died
at
montreal
in
the
following
december
when
on
the
point
of
again
setting
out
for
the
west
his
intrepid
sons
survived
and
they
were
not
idle
one
of
them
the
chevalier
had
before
discovered

to

build
a
fort
there
and
thence
push
westward
in
another
search
for
the

but
a
disastrous
event
ruined
all
his
hopes
la

returned
to
france
and
the
marquis
de

succeeded
him
with
the
notorious
françois
bigot

both
were
greedy
of
money
the

to

and
the

there
was
money
to
be
got
from
the
of

made
every
preparation
and
incurred
every
expense
it
seemed
that
nothing
remained

to
reap
where
he
had
sown

find
the

he
knows
these

better
than

on

contrary
he
had
never
seen
them
it
is
difficult
not
to
believe
that
la

bigot
and
were
partners
in
a
speculation
of
which
all
three
were
to

the
profits
the
elder

not
long
before
his
death
had
sent
a
large
quantity
of
goods
to
his
the
brothers
begged
leave
to
return
thither
and
save
their
property
from
destruction
they
declared
themselves
happy
to
serve
under
the
orders
of
and
asked
for
the
use
of
only
a
single
fort
of
all
those
which
their
father
had
built
at
his
own
cost
the
answer
was
a
flat
refusal
in
short
they
were
shamefully
robbed
the

being
pushed
hard

much

all
the

acquiring
and
of
which

get

the
his
elder

writes
in
a
similar
strain
we
spent
our
youth
and
our
property
in
building
up
establishments
so
advantageous
to
canada
and
after
all
we
were
doomed
to
see
a
stranger
gather
the
fruit
we
had
taken
such
pains
to
and

complains
that
their

left
in

their

they
got
no
redress
backed
by

remained
master
of

the

sold
a
small
piece
of

their
last
remaining
property
to
appease
their
most
pressing
creditors
set
out
for
manitoba
on
the
fifth
of
june
though
he
had
lived
more
or
less
in
the
woods
for
years
and
though
la
jonquière
had
told
the
minister
that
he
knew
the
countries
to
which
he
was
bound
better
than
anybody
else
it
is
clear
from
his
own
journal
that
he
was
now
visiting
them
for
the
first
time
they
did
not
please
him
i
was
told
he
says
that
the
way
would
grow
harder
and
more
dangerous
as
we
advanced
and
i
found
in
fact
that
one
must
risk
life
and
property
every
finding
himself
and
his
men
likely
to
starve
he
sent
some
of
them
under
an
ensign
named
niverville
to
the
saskatchewan
they
could
not
reach
it
and
nearly
perished
on
the
way
i
myself
was
no
more
fortunate
says
food
was
so
scarce
that
i
sent
some
of
my
people
into
the
woods
among
the
indians
which
did
not
save
me
from
a
fast
so
rigorous
that
it
deranged
my
health
and
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
do
anything
towards
accomplishing
my
mission
even
if
i
had
had
strength
enough
the
war
that
broke
out
among
the
indians
would
have
made
it
impossible
to
niverville
after
a
winter
of
misery
tried
to
fulfil
an
order
which
he
had
received
from
his
commander
when
the
indians
guided
the
two
brothers
la
vérendrye
to
the
rocky
mountains
the
course
they
took
tended
so
far
southward
that
the
chevalier
greatly
feared
it
might
lead
to
spanish
settlements
and
he
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
next
attempt
to
find
the
pacific
should
be
made
farther
towards
the
north
had
agreed
with
him
and
had
directed
niverville
to
build
a
fort
on
the
saskatchewan
three
hundred
leagues
above
its
mouth
therefore
at
the
end
of
may
niverville
sent
ten
men
in
two
canoes
on
this
errand
and
they
ascended
the
saskatchewan
to
what
calls
the
rock
here
they
built
a
small
stockade
fort
and
called
it
fort
la
jonquière
niverville
was
to
have
followed
them
but
he
fell
ill
and
lay
helpless
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
in
such
a
condition
that
he
could
not
even
write
to
his
commander
set
out
in
person
from
fort
la
reine
for
fort
la
jonquière
over
ice
and
snow
for
it
was
late
in
november
two
frenchmen
from
niverville
met
him
on
the
way
and
reported
that
the
assiniboins
had
slaughtered
an
entire
band
of
friendly
indians
on
whom
had
relied
to
guide
him
on
hearing
this
he
gave
up
the
enterprise
and
returned
to
fort
la
reine
here
the
indians
told
him
idle
stories
about
white
men
and
a
fort
in
some
remote
place
towards
the
west
but
he
observes
nobody
could
reach
it
without
encountering
an
infinity
of
tribes
more
savage
than
it
is
possible
to
he
spent
most
of
the
winter
at
fort
la
reine
here
towards
the
end
of
february
he
had
with
him
only
five
men
having
sent
out
the
rest
in
search
of
food
suddenly
as
he
sat
in
his
chamber
he
saw
the
fort
full
of
armed
assiniboins
extremely
noisy
and
insolent
he
tried
in
vain
to
quiet
them
and
they
presently
broke
into
the
and
seized
the
arms
a
massacre
would
have
followed
had
not
who
was
far
from
wanting
courage
resorted
to
an
expedient
which
has
more
than
once
proved
effective
on
such
occasions
he
knocked
out
the
heads
of
two
barrels
of
gunpowder
snatched
a
firebrand
and
told
the
yelping
crowd
that
he
would
blow
up
them
and
himself
together
at
this
they
all
rushed
in
fright
out
of
the
gate
while
ran
after
them
and
bolted
it
fast
there
was
great
anxiety
for
the
hunters
but
they
all
came
back
in
the
evening
without
having
met
the
enemy
the
men
however
were
so
terrified
by
the
adventure
that
was
compelled
to
abandon
the
fort
after
recommending
it
to
the
care
of
another
band
of
assiniboins
who
had
professed
great
friendship
four
days
after
he
was
gone
they
burned
it
to
the
ground
he
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
farther
discovery
was
impossible
because
the
english
of
hudson
bay
had
stirred
up
the
western
tribes
to
oppose
it
therefore
he
set
out
for
the
settlements
and
reaching
quebec

the
autumn

the
journal
of
his
futile
enterprise

the

have
a
tradition
that

justify

conjecture

the
context
shows
the
latter
to
be
correct
the
enmity
between
the
sioux
and
the
snakes
lasted
to
our
own
time
when
the
writer
lived
among
the
western
sioux
one
of
their
chiefs
organized
a
against
the
snakes
and
numerous
bands
came
to
join
the
expedition
from
a
distance
in
some
cases
of
three
hundred
miles
quarrels
broke
out
among
them
and
the
scheme
was
ruined
the
above
descriptive
particulars
are
drawn
from
repeated
observation
of
similar
scenes
at
a
time
when
the
primitive
condition
of
these
tribes
was
essentially
unchanged
though
with
the
difference
that
the
concourse
of
savages
counted
by
hundreds
and
not
by
thousands
at
least
this
was
done
by
a
band
of
sioux
with
whom
the
writer
once
traversed
a
part
of
the
country
ranged
by
these
same
snakes
who
had
lately
destroyed
an
entire
sioux
village
the
bighorn
range
below
the
snow
line
is
in
the
main
well
timbered
with
pine
fir
oak
and
juniper
the
only
two
tribes
of
this
region
who
were
a
match
for
the
snakes
were
the
sioux
and
the
blackfeet
it
is
clear
that
the
bow
indians
could
not
have
been
blackfeet
as
in
that
case
after
the
broke
up
they
would
have
moved
northward
towards
their
own
country
instead
of
into
the
country
of
their
enemies
hence
i
incline
to
think
the
bow
indians
a
band
of
sioux
or
dakota
a
people
then
as
since
predominant
in
that
country
the
banks
of
the
missouri
in
the
part
which
la
vérendrye
would
have
reached
in
following

course

occupied
by
numerous

of
sioux
such
as
the

a

warlike

the
passes
of

we
have
seen
that
the
contest
between
france
and
england
in
america
divided
itself
after
the
peace
of
utrecht
into
three
parts
the
acadian
contest
the
contest
for
northern
new
england
and
last
though
greatest
the
contest
for
the
west
nothing
is
more
striking
than
the
difference
or
rather
contrast
in
the
conduct
and
methods
of
the
rival
claimants
to
this
wild
but
magnificent
domain
each
was
strong
in
its
own
qualities
and
utterly
wanting
in
the
qualities
that
marked
its
opponent
on
maps
of
british
america
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
one
sees
the
eastern
shore
from
maine
to
georgia
garnished
with
ten
or
twelve
colored
patches
very
different
in
shape
and
size
and
defined
more
or
less
distinctly
by
which
in
some
cases
are
prolonged
westward
till
they
touch
the
mississippi
or
even
cross
it
and
stretch
indefinitely
towards
the
pacific
these
patches
are
the
british
provinces
and
the
westward
prolongation
of
their
boundary
lines
represents
their
several
claims
to
vast
interior
tracts
founded
on
ancient
grants
but
not
made
good
by
occupation
or
vindicated
by
any
exertion
of
power
these
english
communities
took
little
thought
of
the
region
beyond
the
alleghanies
each
lived
a
life
of
its
own
shut
within
its
own
limits
not
dreaming
of
a
future
collective
greatness
to
which
the
possession
of
the
west
would
be
a
necessary
condition
no
conscious
community
of
aims
and
interests
held
them
together
nor
was
there
any
authority
capable
of
uniting
their
forces
and
turning
them
to
a
common
object
some
of
the
servants
of
the
crown
had
urged
the
necessity
of
joining
them
all
under
a
strong
central
government
as
the
only
means
of
making
them
loyal
subjects
and
arresting
the
encroachments
of
france
but
the
scheme
was
plainly
impracticable
each
province
remained
in
jealous
isolation
busied
with
its
own
work
growing
in
strength
in
the
capacity
of
and
the
spirit
of
independence
and
stubbornly
resisting
all
exercise
of
authority
from
without
if
the
populations
flowed
westward
it
was
in
obedience
to
natural
laws
for
the
king
did
not
aid
the
movement
the
royal
governors
had
no
authority
to
do
so
and
the
colonial
assemblies
were
too
much
engrossed
with
immediate
local
interests
the
power
of
these
colonies
was
that
of
a
rising
flood
slowly
invading
and
conquering
by
the
unconscious
force
of
its
own
growing
volume
unless
means
be
found
to
hold
it
back
by
dams
and
embankments
within
appointed
limits
in
the
french
colonies
all
was
different
here
the
representatives
of
the
crown
were
men
bred
in
an
atmosphere
of
broad
ambition
and
masterful
and
enterprise
achievement
was
demanded
of
them
they
recognized
the
greatness
of
the
prize
studied
the
strong
and
weak
points
of
their
rivals
and
with
a
cautious
forecast
and
a
daring
energy
set
themselves
to
the
task
of
defeating
them
if
the
english
colonies
were
comparatively
strong
in
numbers
their
numbers
could
not
be
brought
into
action
while
if
the
french
forces
were
small
they
were
vigorously
commanded
and
always
ready
at
a
word
it
was
union
confronting
division
energy
confronting
apathy
military
centralization
opposed
to
industrial
democracy
and
for
a
time
the
advantage
was
all
on
one
side
the
demands
of
the
french
were
sufficiently
comprehensive
they
repented
of
their
enforced
concessions
at
the
treaty
of
utrecht
and
in
spite
of
that
compact
maintained
that
with
a
few
local
and
trivial
exceptions
the
whole
north
american
continent
except
mexico
was
theirs
of
right
while
their
opponents
seemed
neither
to
understand
the
situation
nor
see
the
greatness
of
the
stakes
at
issue
in
father
bobé
priest
of
the
congregation
of
missions
drew
up
a
paper
in
which
he
sets
forth
the
claims
of
france
with
much
distinctness
beginning
with
the
declaration
that
england
has
usurped
from
france
nearly
everything
that
she
possesses
in
america
and
adding
that
the
plenipotentiaries
at
utrecht
did
not
know
what
they
were
about
when
they
made
such
concessions
to
the
enemy
that
among
other
blunders
they
gave
port
royal
to
england
when
it
belonged
to
france
who
should
insist
vigorously
on
its
being
given
back
to
her
he
maintains
that
the
voyages
of
verrazzano
and
ribaut
made
france
owner
of
the
whole
continent
from
florida
northward
that
england
was
an
interloper
in
planting
colonies
along
the
atlantic
coast
and
will
admit
as
much
if
she
is
honest
since
all
that
country
is
certainly
a
part
of
new
france
in
this
modest
assumption
of
the
point
at
issue
he
ignores
john
cabot
and
his
son
sebastian
who
discovered
north
america
more
than
years
before
the
voyage
of
verrazzano
and
more
than
sixty
years
before
that
of
ribaut
when
the
english
proceeds
father
bobé
have
restored
port
royal
to
us
which
they
are
bound
to
do
though
we
ceded
it
by
the
treaty
a
french
governor
should
be
at
once
set
over
it
with
a
commission
to
command
as
far
as
cape
cod
which
would
include
boston
we
should
also
fortify
ourselves
in
a
way
to
stop
the
english
who
have
long
tried
to
seize
on
french
america
of
which
they
know
the
importance
and
of
which
he
observes
with
much
candor
they
would
make
a
better
use
than
the
french
the
atlantic
coast
as
far
as
florida
was
usurped
from
the
french
to
whom
it
belonged
then
and
to
whom
it
belongs
england
as
he
thinks
is
bound
in
honor
to
give
back
these
countries
to
their
true
owner
and
it
is
also
the
part
of
wisdom
to
do
so
since
by
grasping
at
too
much
one
often
loses
all
but
france
out
of
her
love
of
peace
will
cede
to
england
the
countries
along
the
atlantic
from
the
kennebec
in
new
france
to
the
jordan
in
carolina
on
condition
that
england
will
restore
to
her
all
that
she
gave
up
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
when
this
is
done
france
always
generous
will
consent
to
accept
as
boundary
a
line
drawn
from
the
mouth
of
the
kennebec
passing
thence
midway
between
schenectady
and
lake
champlain
and
along
the
ridge
of
the
alleghanies
to
the
river
jordan
the
country
between
this
line
and
the
sea
to
belong
to
england
and
the
rest
of
the
continent
to
france
if
england
does
not
accept
this
generous
offer
she
is
to
be
told
that
the
king
will
give
to
the
compagnie
des
indes
law
s
mississippi
company
full
authority
to
occupy
all
the
countries
which
the
english
have
usurped
from
france
and
pursues
father
bobé
it
is
certain
that
the
fear
of
having
to
do
with
so
powerful
a
company
will
bring
the
english
to
our
the
company
that
was
thus
to
strike
the
british
heart
with
terror
was
the
same
which
all
the
tonics
and
stimulants
of
the
government
could
not
save
from
predestined
ruin
but
concludes
this
ingenious
writer
whether
england
accepts
our
offers
or
not
france
ought
not
only
to
take
a
high
tone
avec
but
also
to
fortify
diligently
and
make
good
her
right
by
force
of
arms
three
years
later
we
have
another
document
this
time
of
an
official
character
and
still
more
radical
in
its
demands
it
admits
that
port
royal
and
a
part
of
the
nova
scotian
peninsula
under
the
name
of
acadia
were
ceded
to
england
by
the
treaty
and
consents
that
she
shall
keep
them
but
requires
her
to
restore
the
part
of
new
france
that
she
has
wrongfully
seized
namely
the
whole
atlantic
coast
from
the
kennebec
to
florida
since
france
never
gave
england
this
country
which
is
hers
by
the
discovery
of
verrazzano
in
here
again
the
voyages
of
the
cabots
in
and
are
completely
ignored
it
will
be
seen
pursues
this
curious
document
that
our
kings
have
always
preserved
sovereignty
over
the
countries
between
the
thirtieth
and
the
fiftieth
degrees
of
north
latitude
a
time
will
come
when
they
will
be
in
a
position
to
assert
their
rights
and
then
it
will
be
seen
that
the
dominions
of
a
king
of
france
can
not
be
usurped
with
impunity
what
we
demand
now
is
that
the
english
make
immediate
no
doubt
the
paper
goes
on
to
say
they
will
pretend
to
have
prescriptive
rights
because
they
have
settled
the
country
and
built
towns
and
cities
in
it
but
this
plea
is
of
no
avail
because
all
that
country
is
a
part
of
new
france
and
because
england
rightfully
owns
nothing
in
america
except
what
we
the
french
gave
her
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
which
is
merely
port
royal
and
acadia
she
is
bound
in
honor
to
give
back
all
the
vast
countries
she
has
usurped
but
continues
the
paper
the
king
loves
the
english
nation
too
much
and
wishes
too
much
to
do
her
kindness
and
is
too
generous
to
exact
such
a
restitution
therefore
provided
that
england
will
give
us
back
port
royal
acadia
and
everything
else
that
france
gave
her
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
the
king
will
forego
his
rights
and
grant
to
england
the
whole
atlantic
coast
from
the
degree
of
latitude
to
the
kennebec
to
the
extent
inland
of
twenty
french
leagues
about
fifty
miles
on
condition
that
she
will
solemnly
bind
herself
never
to
overstep
these
limits
or
encroach
in
the
least
on
french
thus
through
the
beneficence
of
france
england
provided
that
she
renounced
all
pretension
to
the
rest
of
the
continent
would
become
the
rightful
owner
of
an
attenuated
strip
of
land
reaching
southward
from
the
kennebec
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
the
document
containing
this
magnanimous
proposal
was
preserved
in
the
château
louis
at
quebec
till
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
boundary
dispute
having
reached
a
crisis
and
commissioners
of
the
two
powers
having
been
appointed
to
settle
it
a
certified
copy
of
the
paper
was
sent
to
france
for
their
instruction
father
bobé
had
advised
that
france
should
not
trust
solely
to
the
justice
of
her
claims
but
should
back
right
with
might
and
build
forts
on
the
niagara
the
ohio
the
tennessee
and
the
alabama
as
well
as
at
other
commanding
points
to
shut
out
the
english
from
the
west
of
these
positions
niagara
was
the
most
important
for
the
possession
of
it
would
close
the
access
to
the
upper
lakes
and
stop
the
western
tribes
on
their
way
to
trade
at
albany
the
five
nations
and
the
governor
of
new
york
were
jealous
of
the
french
designs
which
however
were
likely
enough
to
succeed
through
the
prevailing
apathy
and
divisions
in
the
british
colonies
if
those
not
immediately
concerned
writes
a
member
of
the
new
york
council
only
stand
gazing
on
while
the
wolff
is
murthering
other
parts
of
the
flock
it
will
come
to
every
one
s
turn
at
the
warning
was
well
founded
but
it
was
not
heeded
again
it
is
the
policy
of
the
french
to
attack
one
colony
at
a
time
and
the
others
are
so
besotted
as
to
sit
for
gaining
the
consent
of
the
five
nations
to
the
building
of
a
french
fort
at
niagara
vaudreuil
trusted
chiefly
to
his
agent
among
the
senecas
the
bold
skilful
and
indefatigable
joncaire
who
was
naturalized
among
that
tribe
the
strongest
of
the
confederacy
governor
hunter
of
new
york
sent
peter
schuyler
and
philip
livingston
to
counteract
his
influence
the
five
nations
who
conscious
of
declining
power
seemed
ready
at
this
time
to
be
all
things
to
all
men
declared
that
they
would
prevent
the
french
from
building
at
niagara
which
as
they
said
would
shut
them
up
as
in
a
not
long
before
however
they
had
sent
a
deputation
to
montreal
to
say
that
the
english
made
objection
to
joncaire
s
presence
among
them
but
that
they
were
masters
of
their
land
and
hoped
that
the
french
agent
would
come
as
often
as
he
pleased
and
they
begged
that
the
new
king
of
france
would
take
them
under
his
protection
accordingly
vaudreuil
sent
them
a
present
with
a
message
to
the
effect
that
they
might
plunder
such
english
traders
as
should
come
among
them
yet
so
jealous
were
the
iroquois
of
a
french
fort
at
niagara
that
they
sent
three
seneca
chiefs
to
see
what
was
going
on
there
the
chiefs
found
a
few
frenchmen
in
a
small
blockhouse
or
loopholed
storehouse
which
they
had
just
built
near
lewiston
heights
the
three
senecas
requested
them
to
demolish
it
and
go
away
which
the
frenchmen
refused
to
do
on
which
the
senecas
asked
the
english
envoys
schuyler
and
livingston
to
induce
the
governor
of
new
york
to
destroy
the
obnoxious
building
in
short
the
five
nations
wavered
incessantly
between
their
two
european
neighbors
and
changed
their
minds
every
day
the
skill
and
perseverance
of
the
french
emissaries
so
far
prevailed
at
last
that
the
senecas
consented
to
the
building
of
a
fort
at
the
mouth
of
the
niagara
where
denonville
had
built
one
in
and
thus
that
important
pass
was
made
tolerably
secure
meanwhile
the
english
of
new
york
or
rather
burnet
their
governor
were
not
idle
burnet
was
on
ill
terms
with
his
assembly
which
grudged
him
all
help
in
serving
the
province
whose
interests
it
was
supposed
to
represent
burnet
s
plan
was
to
build
a
fortified
at
oswego
on
lake
ontario
in
the
belief
that
the
western
indians
who
greatly
preferred
english
goods
and
english
prices
would
pass
niagara
and
bring
their
furs
to
the
new
post
he
got
leave
from
the
five
nations
to
execute
his
plan
bought
canoes
hired
men
and
built
a
loopholed
house
of
stone
on
the
site
of
the
present
city
of
oswego
as
the
assembly
would
give
no
money
burnet
furnished
it
himself
and
though
the
object
was
one
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
province
he
was
never
fully
repaid
a
small
garrison
for
the
new
post
was
drawn
from
the
four
independent
companies
maintained
in
the
province
at
the
charge
of
the
crown
the
establishment
of
oswego
greatly
alarmed
and
incensed
the
french
and
a
council
of
war
at
quebec
resolved
to
send
two
thousand
men
against
it
but
vaudreuil
s
successor
the
marquis
de
beauharnois
learning
that
the
court
was
not
prepared
to
provoke
a
war
contented
himself
with
sending
a
summons
to
the
commanding
officer
to
abandon
and
demolish
the
place
within
a
fortnight
to
this
no
attention
was
given
and
as
burnet
had
foreseen
oswego
became
the
great
centre
of
indian
trade
while
niagara
in
spite
of
its
more
favorable
position
was
comparatively
slighted
by
the
western
tribes
the
chief
danger
rose
from
the
obstinate
prejudice
of
the
assembly
which
in
its
disputes
with
the
royal
governor
would
give
him
neither
men
nor
money
to
defend
the
new
post
the
canadian
authorities
who
saw
in
oswego
an
intrusion
on
their
domain
and
a
constant
injury
and
menace
could
not
attack
it
without
bringing
on
a
war
and
therefore
tried
to
persuade
the
five
nations
to
destroy
it
an
attempt
which
completely
failed
they
then

in
another
quarter
the
french
made
an
advance
far
more
threatening
to
the
english
colonies
than
oswego
was
to
their
own
they
had
already
built
a
stone
fort
at
chambly
which
covered
montreal
from
any
english
attack
by
way
of
lake
champlain
as
that
lake
was
the
great
highway
between
the
rival
colonies
the
importance
of
gaining
full
mastery
of
it
was
evident
it
was
rumored
in
canada
that
the
english
meant
to
seize
and
fortify
the
place
called
scalp
point
à
la
by
the
french
and
crown
point
by
the
english
where
the
lake
suddenly
contracts
to
the
proportions
of
a
river
so
that
a
few
cannon
would
stop
the
passage
as
early
as
the
french
made
an
attempt
to
establish
themselves
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
opposite
crown
point
but
were
deterred
by
the
opposition
of
massachusetts
this
eastern
shore
was
however
claimed
not
only
by
massachusetts
but
by
her
neighbor
new
hampshire
with
whom
she
presently
fell
into
a
dispute
about
the
ownership
and
as
a
writer
of
the
time
observes
while
they
were
quarrelling
for
the
bone
the
french
ran
away
with
at
length
in
the
french
took
post
on
the
western
side
of
the
lake
and
began
to
intrench
themselves
at
crown
point
which
was
within
the
bounds
claimed
by
new
york
but
that
province
being
then
engrossed
not
only
by
her
chronic
dispute
with
her
governor
but
by
a
quarrel
with
her
next
neighbor
new
jersey
slighted
the
danger
from
the
common
enemy
and
left
the
french
to
work
their
will
it
was
de
la
corne
lieutenant
du
roy
at
montreal
who
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
fortifying
this
place
in
order
to
anticipate
the
english
who
as
he
imagined
were
about
to
do
so
a
danger
which
was
probably
not
imminent
since
the
english
colonies
as
a
whole
could
not
and
would
not
unite
for
such
a
purpose
while
the
individual
provinces
were
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
internal
affairs
and
their
own
jealousies
and
disputes
to
make
the
attempt
la
corne
s
suggestion
found
favor
at
court
and
the
governor
of
canada
was
ordered
to
occupy
crown
point
the
sieur
de
la
fresnière
was
sent
thither
with
troops
and
workmen
and
a
fort
was
built
and
named
fort
frédéric
it
contained
a
massive
stone
tower
mounted
with
cannon
to
command
the
lake

is
here
but
a

was
established
an
advanced

a
constant
menace
to
new
york
and
new
england
both
of
which
denounced
it
as
an
outrageous
encroachment
on
british
territory
but
could
not
unite
to
rid
themselves
of
it
while
making
this
bold
push
against
their
neighbors
of
the
south
the
french
did
not
forget
the
west
and
towards
the
middle
of
the
century
they
had
occupied
points

to

and
michilimackinac
guarded
the
point
where

is
joined
by

michigan
and
superior
while
the
fort
called
la

at
the
head
of

stopped
the

to
the
mississippi
by
marquette
s
old
route
of

and
the

another

to

controlled
by

on

the

by

of

was
barred
by
a
fort
on

even
if
in
spite
of
these
obstructions
an
enemy
should
reach
the
mississippi
by
any
of
its
northern
affluents
the
cannon
of

would
prevent

from
descending

and

which
were
afterwards
rebuilt
the
one
in

the
other

were
stockades
of
no
strength

slight
as
they
were

contrived
to
make

each
of
them
was
a
station
of
the
and
the
position
of
most
of
them
had
been
determined
more
or
less
with
a
view
to
that
traffic
hence
they
had
no
slight
commercial
value
in
some
of
them
the
crown
itself
carried
on
trade
through
agents
who
usually
secured
a
lion
s
share
of
the
profits
others
were
farmed
out
to
merchants
at
a
fixed
sum
in
others
again
the
commanding
officer
was
permitted
to
trade
on
condition
of
maintaining
the
post
paying
the
soldiers
and
supporting
a
missionary
while
in
one
case
at
least
he
was
subjected
to
similar
obligations
though
not
permitted
to
trade
himself
but
only
to
sell
trading
licenses
to
merchants
these
methods
of
keeping
up
forts
and
garrisons
were
of
course
open
to
prodigious
abuses
and
roused
endless
jealousies
and
rivalries

occupied
the
valley
of

mississippi
and
joined

her
two
colonies
of

and
louisiana

the
strength
of
her
hold
on
these
regions
of
unkempt
savagery
bore
no
proportion
to
the
vastness
of
her
claims
or

news
of
the
declaration
of
war
reached
louisbourg
some
weeks
before
it
reached
boston
and
the
french
military
governor
duquesnel
thought
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
strike
an
unexpected
blow
for
the
profit
of
france
and
his
own
great
honor
one
of
the
french
inhabitants
of
louisbourg
has
left
us
a
short
sketch
of
duquesnel
whom
he
calls
capricious
of
an
uncertain
temper
inclined
to
drink
and
when
in
his
cups
neither
reasonable
or
he
adds
that
the
governor
had
offended
nearly
every
officer
in
the
garrison
and
denounces
him
as
the
chief
cause
of
our
when
duquesnel
heard
of
the
declaration
of
war
his
first
thought
was
to
strike
some
blow
before
the
english
were
warned
the
of
canseau
was
a
tempting
prize
being
a
near
and
an
inconvenient
neighbor
at
the
southern
end
of
the
strait
of
canseau
which
separates
the
acadian
peninsula
from
the
island
of
cape
breton
or
isle
royale
of
which
louisbourg
was
the
place
of
strength
nothing
was
easier
than
to
seize
canseau
which
had
no
defence
but
a
wooden
redoubt
built
by
the
fishermen
and
occupied
by
about
eighty
englishmen
thinking
no
danger
early
in
may
duquesnel
sent
captain
duvivier
against
it
with
six
hundred
or
as
the
english
say
nine
hundred
soldiers
and
sailors
escorted
by
two
small
armed
vessels
the
english
surrendered
on
condition
of
being
sent
to
boston
and
the
miserable
hamlet
with
its
wooden
citadel
was
burned
to
the
ground
thus
far
successful
the
governor
addressed
himself
to
the
capture
of
annapolis
which
meant
the
capture
of
all
acadia
duvivier
was
again
appointed
to
the
command
his
heart
was
in
the
work
for
he
was
a
descendant
of
la
tour
feudal
claimant
of
acadia
in
the
preceding
century
four
officers
and
ninety
regular
troops
were
given
him
and
from
three
to
four
hundred
micmac
and
malicite
indians
joined
him
on
the
way
the
micmacs
under
command
it
is
said
of
their
missionary
le
loutre
had
already
tried
to
surprise
the
english
fort
but
had
only
succeeded
in
killing
two
unarmed
stragglers
in
the
adjacent
garden
annapolis
from
the
neglect
and
indifference
of
the
british
ministry
was
still
in
such
a
state
of
dilapidation
that
its
sandy
ramparts
were
crumbling
into
the
ditches
and
the
cows
of
the
garrison
walked
over
them
at
their
pleasure
it
was
held
by
about
a
hundred
effective
men
under
major
mascarene
a
french
protestant
whose
family
had
been
driven
into
exile
by
the
persecutions
that
followed
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
shirley
governor
of
massachusetts
sent
him
a
small
reinforcement
of
militia
but
as
most
of
these
came
without
arms
and
as
mascarene
had
few
or
none
to
give
them
they
proved
of
doubtful
value
duvivier
and
his
followers
white
and
red
appeared
before
the
fort
in
august
made
their
camp
behind
the
ridge
of
a
hill
that
overlooked
it
and
marched
towards
the
rampart
but
being
met
by
a
discharge
of
they
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
an
immediate
assault
began
a
fusillade
under
cover
of
darkness
and
kept
the
garrison
on
the
alert
all
night
duvivier
had
looked
for
help
from
the
acadians
of
the
neighboring
village
who
were
french
in
blood
faith
and
inclination
they
would
not
join
him
openly
fearing
the
consequences
if
his
attack
should
fail
but
they
did
what
they
could
without
committing
themselves
and
made
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
besiegers
duvivier
now
returned
to
his
first
plan
of
an
assault
which
if
made
with
vigor
could
hardly
have
failed
before
attempting
it
he
sent
mascarene
a
flag
of
truce
to
tell
him
that
he
hourly
expected
two
powerful
armed
ships
from
louisbourg
besides
a
reinforcement
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
regulars
with
cannon
mortars
and
other
enginery
of
war
at
the
same
time
he
proposed
favorable
terms
of
capitulation
not
to
take
effect
till
the
french
should
have
appeared
mascarene
refused
all
terms
saying
that
when
he
saw
the
french
ships
he
would
consider
what
to
do
and
meanwhile
would
defend
himself
as
he
could
the
expected
ships
were
the
ardent
and
the
caribou
then
at
louisbourg
a
french
writer
says
that
when
duquesnel
directed
their
captains
to
hail
for
annapolis
and
aid
in
its
capture
they
refused
saying
that
they
had
no
orders
from
the
court
duvivier
protracted
the
parley
with
mascarene
and
waited
in
vain
for
the
promised
succor
at
length
the
truce
was
broken
off
and
the
garrison
who
had
profited
by
it
to
get
rest
and
sleep
greeted
the
renewal
of
hostilities
with
three
cheers
now
followed
three
weeks
of
desultory
attacks
but
there
was
no
assault
though
duvivier
had
boasted
that
he
had
the
means
of
making
a
successful
one
he
waited
for
the
ships
which
did
not
come
and
kept
the
acadians
at
work
in
making
ladders
and
at
length
instead
of
aid
from
louisbourg
two
small
vessels
appeared
from
boston
bringing
mascarene
a
reinforcement
of
fifty
indian
rangers
this
discouraged
the
besiegers
and
towards
the
end
of
september
they
suddenly
decamped
and
vanished
the
expedition
was
a
failure
writes
the
de
though
one
might
have
bet
everything
on
its
success
so
small
was
the
force
that
the
enemy
had
to
resist
this
writer
thinks
that
the
seizure
of
canseau
and
the
attack
of
annapolis
were
sources
of
dire
calamity
to
the
french
perhaps
he
says
the
english
would
have
let
us
alone
if
we
had
not
first
insulted
them
it
was
the
interest
of
the
people
of
new
england
to
live
at
peace
with
us
and
they
would
no
doubt
have
done
so
if
we
had
not
taken
it
into
our
heads
to
waken
them
from
their
security
they
expected
that
both
parties
would
merely
stand
on
the
defensive
without
taking
part
in
this
cruel
war
that
has
set
europe
in
a
whatever
might
otherwise
have
been
the
disposition
of
the
bastonnais
or
new
england
people
the
attacks
on
canseau
and
annapolis
alarmed
and
exasperated
them
and
engendered
in
some
heated
brains
a
project
of
wild
audacity
this
was
no
less
than
the
capture
of
louisbourg
reputed
the
strongest
fortress
french
or
british
in
north
america
with
the
possible
exception
of
quebec
which
owed
its
chief
strength
to
nature
and
not
to
art
louisbourg
was
a
standing
menace
to
all
the
northern
british
colonies
it
was
the
only
french
naval
station
on
the
continent
and
was
such
a
haunt
of
privateers
that
it
was
called
the
american
dunkirk
it
commanded
the
chief
entrance
of
canada
and
threatened
to
ruin
the
fisheries
which
were
nearly
as
vital
to
new
england
as
was
the
to
new
france
the
french
government
had
spent
years
in
fortifying
it
and
the
cost
of
its
powerful
defences
constructed
after
the
system
of
vauban
was
reckoned
at
thirty
million
livres
this
was
the
fortress
which
william
vaughan
of
damariscotta
advised
governor
shirley
to
attack
with
fifteen
hundred
raw
new
england
militia
vaughan
was
born
at
portsmouth
in
and
graduated
at
harvard
college
nineteen
years
later
his
father
also
a
graduate
of
harvard
was
for
a
time
of
new
hampshire
soon
after
leaving
college
the
younger
vaughan
a
youth
of
restless
and
impetuous
activity
established
a
on
the
island
of
matinicus
off
the
coast
of
maine
and
afterwards
became
the
owner
of
most
of
the
land
on
both
sides
of
the
little
river
damariscotta
where
he
built
a
or
wooden
fort
established
a
considerable
settlement
and
carried
on
an
extensive
trade
in
fish
and
timber
he
passed
for
a
man
of
ability
and
force
but
was
accused
of
a
headstrong
rashness
a
that
hesitated
at
nothing
and
a
harebrained
contempt
of
every
obstacle
in
his
way
once
having
fitted
out
a
number
of
small
vessels
at
portsmouth
for
his
fishing
at
matinicus
he
named
a
time
for
sailing
it
was
a
gusty
and
boisterous
march
day
the
sea
was
rough
and
old
sailors
told
him
that
such
craft
could
not
carry
sail
vaughan
would
not
listen
but
went
on
board
and
ordered
his
men
to
follow
one
vessel
was
wrecked
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
the
rest
after
severe
buffeting
came
safe
with
their
owner
to
matinicus
being
interested
in
the
fisheries
vaughan
was
doubly
hostile
to
louisbourg
their
worst
enemy
he
found
a
willing
listener
in
the
governor
william
shirley
shirley
was
an
english
barrister
who
had
come
to
massachusetts
in
to
practise
his
profession
and
seek
his
fortune
after
filling
various
offices
with
credit
he
was
made
governor
of
the
province
in
and
had
discharged
his
duties
with
both
tact
and
talent
he
was
able
sanguine
and
a
sincere
to
the
province
though
gnawed
by
an
insatiable
hunger
for
distinction
he
thought
himself
a
born
strategist
and
was
possessed
by
a
propensity
for
contriving
military
operations
which
finally
cost
him
dear
vaughan
who
knew
something
of
louisbourg
told
him
that
in
winter
the
were
often
banked
so
high
against
the
rampart
that
it
could
be
mounted
readily
if
the
assailants
could
but
time
their
arrival
at
the
right
moment
this
was
not
easy
as
that
rocky
and
tempestuous
coast
was
often
made
inaccessible
by
fogs
and
surf
shirley
therefore
preferred
a
plan
of
his
own
contriving
but
nothing
could
be
done
without
first
persuading
his
assembly
to
consent
on
the
ninth
of
january
the
general
court
of
massachusetts
a
convention
of
grave
city
merchants
and
solemn
rustics
from
the
country
villages
was
astonished
by
a
message
from
the
governor
to
the
effect
that
he
had
a
communication
to
make
so
critical
that
he
wished
the
whole
body
to
swear
secrecy
the
request
was
novel
but
being
then
on
good
terms
with
shirley
the
representatives
consented
and
took
the
oath
then
to
their
amazement
the
governor
invited
them
to
undertake
forthwith
the
reduction
of
louisbourg
the
idea
of
an
attack
on
that
redoubtable
fortress
was
not
new
since
the
autumn
proposals
had
been
heard
to
petition
the
british
ministry
to
make
the
attempt
under
a
promise
that
the
colonies
would
give
their
best
aid
but
that
massachusetts
should
venture
it
alone
or
with
such
doubtful
help
as
her
neighbors
might
give
at
her
own
charge
and
risk
though
already
insolvent
without
the
approval
or
consent
of
the
ministry
and
without
experienced
officers
or
trained
soldiers
was
a
startling
suggestion
to
the
legislators
of
the
general
court
they
listened
however
with
respect
to
the
governor
s
reasons
and
appointed
a
committee
of
the
two
houses
to
consider
them
the
committee
deliberated
for
several
days
and
then
made
a
report
adverse
to
the
plan
as
was
also
the
vote
of
the
court
meanwhile
in
spite
of
the
oath
the
secret
had
escaped
it
is
said
that
a
country
member
more
pious
than
discreet
prayed
so
loud
and
fervently
at
his
lodgings
for
light
to
guide
him
on
the
momentous
question
that
his
words
were
overheard
and
the
mystery
of
the
closed
doors
was
revealed
the
news
flew
through
the
town
and
soon
spread
through
all
the
province
after
his
defeat
in
the
assembly
shirley
returned
vexed
and
disappointed
to
his
house
in
roxbury
a
few
days
later
james
gibson
a
boston
merchant
says
that
he
saw
him
walking
slowly
down
king
street
with
his
head
bowed
down
as
if
in
a
deep
he
entered
my
pursues
the
merchant
and
abruptly
said
gibson
do
you
feel
like
giving
up
the
expedition
to
louisbourg
gibson
replied
that
he
wished
the
house
would
reconsider
their
vote
you
are
the
very
man
i
want
exclaimed
the
governor
they
then
drew
up
a
petition
for
reconsideration
which
gibson
signed
promising
to
get
also
the
signatures
of
merchants
not
only
of
boston
but
of
salem
marblehead
and
other
towns
along
the
coast
in
this
he
was
completely
successful
as
all
new
england
merchants
looked
on
louisbourg
as
an
the
petition
was
presented
and
the
question
came
again
before
the
assembly
there
had
been
much
intercourse
between
boston
and
louisbourg
which
had
largely
depended
on
new
england
for
provisions
the
captured
militiamen
of
canseau
who
after
some
delay
had
been
sent
to
boston
according
to
the
terms
of
surrender
had
used
their
opportunities
to
the
utmost
and
could
give
shirley
much
information
concerning
the
fortress
it
was
reported
that
the
garrison
was
mutinous
and
that
provisions
were
fallen
short
so
that
the
place
could
not
hold
out
without
supplies
from
france
these
however
could
be
cut
off
only
by
blockading
the
harbor
with
a
stronger
naval
force
than
all
the
colonies
together
could
supply
the
assembly
had
before
reached
the
reasonable
conclusion
that
the
capture
of
louisbourg
was
beyond
the
strength
of
massachusetts
and
that
the
only
course
was
to
ask
the
help
of
the
the
reports
of
mutiny
it
was
urged
could
not
be
depended
on
raw
militia
in
the
open
field
were
no
match
for
disciplined
troops
behind
ramparts
the
expense
would
be
enormous
and
the
credit
of
the
province
already
sunk
low
would
collapse
under
it
we
should
fail
and
instead
of
sympathy
get
nothing
but
ridicule
such
were
the
arguments
of
the
opposition
to
which
there
was
little
to
answer
except
that
if
massachusetts
waited
for
help
from
england
louisbourg
would
be
reinforced
and
the
golden
opportunity
lost
the
impetuous
and
irrepressible
vaughan
put
forth
all
his
energy
the
plan
was
carried
by
a
single
vote
and
even
this
result
was
said
to
be
due
to
the
accident
of
a
member
in
opposition
falling
and
breaking
a
leg
as
he
was
hastening
to
the
house
the
die
was
cast
and
now
doubt
and
hesitation
vanished
all
alike
set
themselves
to
push
on
the
work
shirley
wrote
to
all
the
colonies
as
far
south
as
pennsylvania
to
ask
for
all
excused
themselves
except
connecticut
new
hampshire
and
rhode
island
and
the
whole
burden
fell
on
the
four
new
england
colonies
these
and
massachusetts
above
all
blazed
with
pious
zeal
for
as
the
enterprise
was
directed
against
roman
catholics
it
was
supposed
in
a
peculiar
manner
to
commend
itself
to
heaven
there
were
prayers
without
ceasing
in
churches
and
families
and
all
was
ardor
energy
and
confidence
while
the
other
colonies
looked
on
with
distrust
dashed
with
derision
when
benjamin
franklin
in
philadelphia
heard
what
was
afoot
he
wrote
to
his
brother
in
boston
fortified
towns
are
hard
nuts
to
crack
and
your
teeth
are
not
accustomed
to
it
but
some
seem
to
think
that
forts
are
as
easy
taken
as
it
has
been
said
of
franklin
that
while
he
represented
some
of
the
new
england
qualities
he
had
no
part
in
that
enthusiasm
of
which
our
own
time
saw
a
crowning
example
when
the
cannon
opened
at
fort
sumter
and
which
pushes
to
its
end
without
reckoning
chances
counting
costs
or
heeding
the
scoffs
of
the
prevailing
hope
and
faith
were
it
is
true
born
largely
of
ignorance
aided
by
the
contagious
zeal
of
those
who
first
broached
the
project
for
as
usual
in
such
cases
a
few
individuals
supplied
the
initiate
force
of
the
enterprise
vaughan
the
indefatigable
rode
express
to
portsmouth
with
a
letter
from
shirley
to
benning
wentworth
governor
of
new
hampshire
that
pompous
and
personage
admired
the
massachusetts
governor
who
far
surpassed
him
in
talents
and
acquirements
and
who
at
the
same
time
knew
how
to
soothe
his
vanity
wentworth
was
ready
to
do
his
part
but
his
province
had
no
money
and
the
king
had
ordered
him
to
permit
the
issue
of
no
more
paper
currency
the
same
prohibition
had
been
laid
upon
shirley
but
he
with
sagacious
forecast
had
persuaded
his
masters
to
relent
so
far
as
to
permit
the
issue
of
in
what
were
called
bills
of
credit
to
meet
any
pressing
exigency
of
war
he
told
this
to
wentworth
and
succeeded
in
convincing
him
that
his
province
might
stretch
her
credit
like
massachusetts
in
case
of
similar
military
need
new
hampshire
was
thus
enabled
to
raise
a
regiment
of
five
hundred
men
out
of
her
scanty
population
with
the
condition
that
a
hundred
and
fifty
of
them
should
be
paid
and
fed
by
massachusetts
shirley
was
less
fortunate
in
rhode
island
the
governor
of
that
little
colony
called
massachusetts
our
avowed
enemy
always
trying
to
defame
there
was
a
grudge
between
the
neighbors
due
partly
to
notorious
by
the
massachusetts
puritans
of
roger
williams
founder
of
rhode
island
and
partly
to
one
of
those
boundary
disputes
which
often
produced
among
the
colonies
the
representatives
of
rhode
island
forgetting
past
differences
voted
to
raise
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
for
the
expedition
till
learning
that
the
project
was
neither
ordered
nor
approved
by
the
home
government
they
prudently
reconsidered
their
action
they
voted
however
that
the
colony
sloop
tartar
carrying
fourteen
cannon
and
twelve
swivels
should
be
equipped
and
manned
for
the
service
and
that
the
governor
should
be
instructed
to
find
and
commission
a
captain
and
a
lieutenant
to
command
her

five
hundred
and
sixteen
men
and
officers
on
condition
that
roger
wolcott
their
commander
should
have
the
second
rank
in
the
expedition
shirley
accordingly
commissioned
him
as
as
massachusetts
was
to
supply
above
three
thousand
men
or
more
than
three
quarters
of
the
whole
force
she
had
a
natural
right
to
name
a
it
was
not
easy
to
choose
one
the
colony
had
been
at
peace
for
twenty
years
and
except
some
grizzled
indian
fighters
of
the
last
war
and
some
survivors
of
the
carthagena
expedition
nobody
had
seen
service
few
knew
well
what
a
fortress
was
and
nobody
knew
how
to
attack
one
courage
energy
good
sense
and
popularity
were
the
best
qualities
to
be
hoped
for
in
the
leader
popularity
was
indispensable
for
the
soldiers
were
all
to
be
volunteers
and
they
would
not
enlist
under
a
commander
whom
they
did
not
like
shirley
s
choice
was
william
pepperrell
a
merchant
of
kittery
knowing
that
benning
wentworth
thought
himself
the
man
for
the
place
he
made
an
effort
to
placate
him
and
wrote
that
he
would
gladly
have
given
him
the
chief
command
but
for
his
gouty
legs
wentworth
took
fire
at
the
suggestion
forgot
his
gout
and
declared
himself
ready
to
serve
his
country
and
assume
the
burden
of
command
the
position
was
awkward
and
shirley
was
forced
to
reply
on
communicating
your
offer
to
two
or
three
gentlemen
in
whose
judgment
i
most
confide
i
found
them
clearly
of
opinion
that
any
alteration
of
the
present
command
would
be
attended
with
great
risk
both
with
respect
to
our
assembly
and

times

these
lines
at
a
window
of
this
curious
old
house
and
before
me
spreads
the
scene
familiar
to
pepperrell
from
childhood
here
the
river
piscataqua
widens
to
join
the
sea
holding
in
its
gaping
mouth
the
large
island
of
newcastle
with
attendant
groups
of
islets
and
island
rocks
battered
with
the
rack
of
ages
studded
with
dwarf
savins
or
half
clad
with
patches
of
whortleberry
bushes
sumach
and
the
shining
green
in
summer
red
with
the
touch
of
october
the
flood
tide
pours
strong
and
full
around
them
only
to
ebb
away
and
lay
bare
a
desolation
of
rocks
and
stones
buried
in
a
shock
of
brown
drenched
seaweed
broad
tracts
of
glistening
mud
black
with
and
meadows
of
with
myriads
of
minute
clinging
to
its
long
lank
tresses
beyond
all
these
lies
the
main
or
northern
channel
more
than
deep
enough
even
when
the
tide
is
out
to
float
a
on
its
farther
bank
stands
the
old
house
of
the
pepperrells
wearing
even
now
an
air
of
dingy
respectability
looking
through
its
small
quaint
one
could
see
across
the
water
the
rude
dwellings
of
fishermen
along
the
shore
of
newcastle
and
the
neglected
earthwork
called
fort
william
and
mary
that
feebly
guarded
the
river
s
mouth
in
front
the
piscataqua
curving
southward
widened
to
meet
the
atlantic
between
rocky
headlands
and
foaming
reefs
and
in
dim
distance
the
isles
of
shoals
seemed
floating
on
the
pale
gray
sea
behind
the
pepperrell
house
was
a
garden
probably
more
useful
than
ornamental
and
at
the
foot
of
it
were
the
owner
s
wharves
with
storehouses
for
naval
stores
and
imported
goods
for
the
country
trade
pepperrell
was
the
son
of
a
welshman
who
migrated
in
early
life
to
the
isles
of
shoals
and
thence
to
kittery
where
by
trade
and
the
fisheries
he
made
a
fortune
most
of
which
he
left
to
his
son
william
the
young
pepperrell
learned
what
little
was
taught
at
the
village
school
supplemented
by
a
private
tutor
whose
instructions
however
did
not
perfect
him
in
english
grammar
in
the
eyes
of
his
father
education
was
valuable
only
so
far
as
it
could
make
a
successful
trader
and
on
this
point
he
had
reason
to
be
satisfied
as
his
son
passed
for
many
years
as
the
chief
merchant
in
new
england
he
dealt
in
ships
timber
naval
stores
fish
and
miscellaneous
goods
brought
from
england
and
he
also
greatly
prospered
by
successful
land
purchases
becoming
owner
of
the
greater
part
of
the
growing
towns
of
saco
and
scarborough
when
scarcely
he
was
made
justice
of
the
peace
on
which
he
ordered
from
london
what
his
biographer
calls
a
law
library
consisting
of
a
law
dictionary
danvers
abridgment
of
the
common
law
the
complete
solicitor
and
several
other
books
in
law
as
in
war
his
best
qualities
were
good
sense
and
about
the
time
when
he
was
made
a
justice
he
was
commissioned
captain
of
militia
then
major
then
and
at
last
colonel
commanding
all
the
militia
of
maine
the
town
of
kittery
chose
him
to
represent
her
in
the
general
court
maine
being
then
a
part
of
massachusetts
finally
he
was
made
a
member
of
the
governor
s
council
a
post
which
he
held
for
years
during
eighteen
of
which
he
was
president
of
the
board
these
civil
dignities
served
him
as
educators
better
than
tutor
or
village
school
for
they
brought
him
into
close
contact
with
the
chief
men
of
the
province
and
in
the
massachusetts
of
that
time
so
different
from
our
own
the
best
education
and
breeding
were
found
in
the
official
class
at
once
a
provincial
magnate
and
the
great
man
of
a
small
rustic
village
his
manners
are
said
to
have
answered
to
both
positions
certainly
they
were
such
as
to
make
him
popular
but
whatever
he
became
as
a
man
he
learned
nothing
to
fit
him
to
command
an
army
and
lay
siege
to
louisbourg
perhaps
he
felt
this
and
thought
with
the
governor
of
rhode
island
that
the
attempt
to
reduce
that
prodigiously
strong
town
was
too
much
for
new
england
which
had
not
one
officer
of
experience
nor
even
an
moreover
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
wife
children
and
business
he
was
of
a
religious
turn
of
mind
and
partial
to
the
clergy
who
on
their
part
held
him
in
high
favor
one
of
them
the
famous
preacher
george
whitefield
was
a
guest
at
his
house
when
he
heard
that
shirley
had
appointed
him
to
command
the
expedition
against
louisbourg
whitefield
had
been
the
leading
spirit
in
the
recent
religious
fermentation
called
the
great
awakening
which
though
it
produced
bitter
quarrels
among
the
ministers
besides
other
undesirable
results
was
imagined
by
many
to
make
for
righteousness
so
thought
the
rev
thomas
prince
who
mourned
over
the
subsiding
delirium
of
his
flock
as
a
sign
of
backsliding
the
heavenly
shower
was
over
he
sadly
exclaims
from
fighting
the
devil
they
must
turn
to
fighting
the
pepperrell
always
inclined
to
the
clergy
and
now
in
great
perplexity
and
doubt
asked
his
guest
whitefield
whether
or
not
he
had
better
accept
the
command
whitefield
gave
him
cold
comfort
told
him
that
the
enterprise
was
not
very
promising
and
that
if
he
undertook
it
he
must
do
so
with
a
single
eye
prepared
for
obloquy
if
he
failed
and
envy
if
he
succeeded
henry
sherburn
commissary
of
the
new
hampshire
regiment
begged
whitefield
to
furnish
a
motto
for
the
flag
the
preacher
who
zealot
as
he
was
seemed
unwilling
to
mix
himself
with
so
madcap
a
business
hesitated
at
first
but
at
length
consented
and
suggested
the
words
desperandum
christo
which
being
adopted
gave
the
enterprise
the
air
of
a
crusade
it
had
in
fact
something
of
the
character
of
one
the
cause
was
imagined
to
be
the
cause
of
heaven
crowned
with
celestial
benediction
it
had
the
fervent
support
of
the
ministers
not
only
by
prayers
and
sermons
but
in
one
case
by
counsels
wholly
temporal
a
certain
pastor
much
esteemed
for
benevolence
proposed
to
pepperrell
who
had
at
last
accepted
the
command
a
plan
unknown
to
vauban
for
confounding
the
devices
of
the
enemy
he
advised
that
two
trustworthy
persons
should
cautiously
walk
together
along
the
front
of
the
french
ramparts
under
cover
of
night
one
of
them
carrying
a
mallet
with
which
he
was
to
hammer
the
ground
at
short
intervals
the
french
sentinels
it
seems
to
have
been
supposed
on
hearing
this
mysterious
thumping
would
be
so
bewildered
as
to
give
no
alarm
while
one
of
the
two
partners
was
thus
employed
the
other
was
to
lay
his
ear
to
the
ground
which
as
the
adviser
thought
would
return
a
hollow
sound
if
the
artful
foe
had
dug
a
mine
under
it
and
whenever
such
secret
danger
was
detected
a
mark
was
to
be
set
on
the
spot
to
warn
off
the
soldiers
equally
zealous
after
another
fashion
was
the
rev
samuel
moody
popularly
known
as
father
moody
or
parson
moody
minister
of
york
and
senior
chaplain
of
the
expedition
though
about
seventy
years
old
he
was
amazingly
tough
and
sturdy
he
still
lives
in
the
traditions
of
york
as
the
spiritual
despot
of
the
settlement
and
the
uncompromising
guardian
of
its
manners
and
doctrine
predominating
over
it
like
a
rough
little
village
pope
the
comparison
would
have
kindled
his
burning
wrath
for
he
abhorred
the
holy
father
as
an
embodied
antichrist
many
are
the
stories
told
of
him
by
the
descendants
of
those
who
lived
under
his
rod
and
sometimes
felt
its
weight
for
he
was
known
to
have
corrected
offending
parishioners
with
his
cane
when
some
one
of
his
flock
nettled
by
his
strictures
from
the
pulpit
walked
in
dudgeon
towards
the
church
door
moody
would
shout
after
him
come
back
you
graceless
sinner
come
back
or
if
any
ventured
to
the
alehouse
of
a
saturday
night
the
strenuous
pastor
would
go
in
after
them
collar
them
drag
them
out
and
send
them
home
with
rousing
admonition
few
dared
gainsay
him
by
reason
both
of
his
irritable
temper
and
of
the
insensibility
that
encased
him
like
armor
of
proof
and
while
his
pachydermatous
nature
made
him
invulnerable
as
a
rhinoceros
he
had
at
the
same
time
a
rough
and
ready
humor
that
supplied
keen
weapons
for
the
warfare
of
words
and
made
him
a
formidable
antagonist
this
commended
him
to
the
rude
borderers
who
also
relished
the
sulphurous
theology
of
their
spiritual
dictator
just
as
they
liked
the
raw
and
fiery
liquors
that
would
have
scorched
more
susceptible
stomachs
what
they
did
not
like
was
the
pitiless
length
of
his
prayers
which
sometimes
kept
them
afoot
above
two
hours
shivering
in
the
polar
cold
of
the
unheated
and
which
were
followed
by
sermons
of
equal
endurance
for
the
old
man
s
lungs
were
of
brass
and
his
nerves
of
hammered
iron
some
of
the
sufferers
ventured
to
remonstrate
but
this
only
exasperated
him
till
one
parishioner
more
worldly
wise
than
the
rest
accompanied
his
modest
petition
for
mercy
with
the
gift
of
a
barrel
of
cider
after
which
the
parson
s
ministrations
were
perceptibly
less
exhausting
than
before
he
had
an
irrepressible
conscience
and
a
highly
aggressive
sense
of
duty
which
made
him
an
intolerable
meddler
in
the
affairs
of
other
people
and
which
joined
to
an
underlying
kindness
of
heart
made
him
so
indiscreet
in
his
charities
that
his
wife
and
children
were
often
driven
to
vain
protest
against
the
excesses
of
his
almsgiving
the
old
puritan
fanaticism
was
rampant
in
him
and
when
he
sailed
for
louisbourg
he
took
with
him
an
axe
intended
as
he
said
to
hew
down
the
altars
of
antichrist
and
demolish
his
idols
shirley
s
choice
of
a
commander
was
perhaps
the
best
that
could
have
been
made
for
pepperrell
joined
to
an
unusual
popularity
as
little
military
incompetency
as
anybody
else
who
could
be
had
popularity
we
have
seen
was
indispensable
and
even
company
officers
were
appointed
with
an
eye
to
it
many
of
these
were
men
in
rustic
neighborhoods
who
had
raised
companies
in
the
hope
of
being
commissioned
to
command
them
others
were
militia
officers
recruiting
under
orders
of
the
governor

of

of
the
most
exposed

on

border
volunteers
offered
themselves
readily
everywhere
though
the
pay
was
meagre
especially
in
maine
and
massachusetts
where
in
the
new
provincial
currency
it
was

then
equal
to
fourteen

less
than
sixpence

or
more
than
a
thousand
men
are
reported
to
have
come
from
the
hardy
population
of
maine
whose
entire
fighting
force
as
shown
by
the
was
then
but
perhaps
there
was
not
one
officer
among
them
whose
experience
of
war
extended
beyond
a
drill
on
muster
day
and
the
sham
fight
that
closed
the
performance
when
it
generally
happened
that
the
rustic
warriors
were
treated
with
rum
at
the
charge
of
their
captain
to
put
them
in
good
humor
and
so
induce
them
to
obey
the
word
of
command
as
the
three
provinces
contributing
soldiers
recognized
no
common
authority
nearer
than
the
king
pepperrell
received
three
several
commissions
as
one
from
the
governor
of
massachusetts
and
the
others
from
the
governors
of
connecticut
and
new
hampshire
while
wolcott
commander
of
the
connecticut
forces
was
commissioned
as
by
both
the
governor
of
his
own
province
and
that
of
massachusetts
when
the
levies
were
complete
it
was
found
that
massachusetts
had
contributed
about

and
new

in
her
own
pay
besides

lost
faith
and
disbanded

but
afterwards
raised
them
again
though
too
late
to
take

in
the
siege
each
of
the
four
new
england
colonies
had
a
little
navy
of
its
own
consisting
of
from
one
to
three
or
four
small
armed
vessels
and
as
privateering
which
was
sometimes
a
euphemism
for
piracy
where
frenchmen
and
spaniards
were
concerned
was
a
favorite
occupation
it
was
possible
to
extemporize
an
additional
force
in
case
of
need
for
a
naval
commander
shirley
chose
captain
edward
tyng
who
had
signalized
himself
in
the
past
summer
by
capturing
a
french
privateer
of
greater
strength
than
his
own
shirley
authorized
him
to
buy
for
the
province
the
best
ship
he
could
find
equip
her
for
fighting
and
take
command
of
her
tyng
soon
found
a
brig
to
his
mind
on
the
stocks
nearly
ready
for
launching
she
was
rapidly
fitted
for
her
new
destination
converted
into
a
frigate
mounted
with
guns
and
named
the
the
rest
of
the
naval
force
consisted
of
the
ship
cæsar
of
guns
a
vessel
called
the
shirley
commanded
by
captain
rous
and
also
carrying
guns
another
of
the
kind
called
a

carrying
carriage

and
swivels
and
finally
the
sloop
of
guns
which
formed
the
navy
of
new
hampshire
it
was
said
with
apparent
reason
that
one
or
two
heavy
french
and
a
number
of
such
was
expected
in
the
spring
would
outmatch
the
whole
colonial
squadron
and
after
mastering
it
would
hold
all
the
transports
at
mercy
so
that
the
troops
on
shore
having
no
means
of
return
and
no
hope
of
succor
would
be
forced
to
surrender
or
starve
the
danger
was
real
and
serious
and
shirley
felt
the
necessity
of
help
from
a
few
british
commodore
peter
warren
was
then
with
a
small
squadron
at
antigua
shirley
sent
an
express
boat
to
him
with
a
letter
stating
the
situation
and
asking
his
aid
warren
who
had
married
an
american
woman
and
who
owned
large
tracts
of
land
on
the
mohawk
was
known
to
be
a
warm
friend
to
the
provinces
it
is
clear
that
he
would
gladly
have
complied
with
shirley
s
request
but
when
he
laid
the
question
before
a
council
of
officers
they
were
of
one
mind
that
without
orders
from
the
admiralty
he
would
not
be
justified
in
supporting
an
attempt
made
without
the
approval
of
the
king
he
therefore
saw
no
choice
but
to
decline
shirley
fearing
that
his
refusal
would
be
too
discouraging
kept
it
secret
from
all
but
pepperrell
and
general
wolcott
or
as
others
say
brigadier
waldo
he
had
written
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
in
the
preceding
autumn
that
acadia
and
the
fisheries
were
in
great
danger
and
that
were
needed
for
their
protection
on
this
the
duke
had
written
to
warren
ordering
him
to
sail
for
boston
and
concert
measures
with
shirley
for
the
annoyance
of
the
enemy
and
his
majesty
s
service
in
north
newcastle
s
letter
reached
warren
only
two
or
three
days
after
he
had
sent
back
his
refusal
of
shirley
s
request
thinking
himself
now
sufficiently
authorized
to
give
the
desired
aid
he
made
all
sail
for
boston
with
his
three
ships
the
superbe
mermaid
and
on
the
way
he
met
a
schooner
from
boston
and
learned
from
its
officers
that
the
expedition
had
already
sailed
on
which
detaining
the
master
as
a
pilot
he
changed
his
course
and
made
directly
for
canseau
the
place
of
rendezvous
of
the
expedition
and
at
the
same
time
sent
orders
by
the
schooner
that
any
king
s
ships
that
might
arrive
at
boston
should
immediately
join
him
within
seven
weeks
after
shirley
issued
his
proclamation
for
volunteers
the
preparations
were
all
made
and
the
unique
armament
was
afloat
transports
such
as
they
were
could
be
had
in
abundance
for
the
harbors
of
salem
and
marblehead
were
full
of
thrown
out
of
employment
by
the
war
these
were
hired
and
insured
by
the
province
for
the
security
of
the
owners
there
was
a
great
dearth
of
cannon
the
few
that
could
be
had
were
too
light
the
heaviest
being
of
calibre
new
york
lent
ten
to
the
expedition
but
the
adventurers
looked
to
the
french
for
their
chief
supply
a
detached
work
near
louisbourg
called
the
grand
or
royal
battery
was
known
to
be
armed
with
thirty
heavy
pieces
and
these
it
was
proposed
to
capture
and
turn
against
the
town
which
as
hutchinson
remarks
was
like
selling
the
skin
of
the
bear
before
catching
it
was
clear
that
the
expedition
must
run
for
luck
against
risks
of
all
kinds
those
whose
hopes
were
highest
based
them
on
a
belief
in
the
special
and
direct
interposition
of
providence
others
were
sanguine
through
ignorance
and
provincial
as
soon
as
the
troops
were
embarked
shirley
wrote
to
the
ministers
of
what
was
going
on
telling
them
that
accidents
apart
four
thousand
new
england
men
would
land
on
cape
breton
in
april
and
that
even
should
they
fail
to
capture
louisbourg
he
would
answer
for
it
that
they
would
lay
the
town
in
ruins
retake
canseau
do
other
good
service
to
his
majesty
and
then
come
safe
home
on
receiving
this
communication
the
government
resolved
to
aid
the
enterprise
if
there
should
yet
be
time
and
accordingly
ordered
several
to
sail
for
louisbourg
the
sarcastic
douglas
then
living
at
boston
writes
that
the
expedition
had
a
lawyer
for
contriver
a
merchant
for
general
and
farmers
fishermen
and
mechanics
for
soldiers
in
fact
it
had
something
of
the
character
of
broad
farce
to
which
shirley
himself
with
all
his
ability
and
general
good
sense
was
a
chief
contributor
he
wrote
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
that
though
the
officers
had
no
experience
and
the
men
no
discipline
he
would
take
care
to
provide
against
these
defects
meaning
that
he
would
give
exact
directions
how
to
take
louisbourg
accordingly
he
drew
up
copious
instructions
to
that
effect
these
seem
to
have
undergone
a
process
of
evolution
for
several
distinct
drafts
of
them
are
preserved
the
complete
and
final
one
is
among
the
pepperrell
papers
copied
entire
in
the
neat
commercial
hand
of
the
general
himself
it
seems
to
assume
that
providence
would
work
a
continued
miracle
and
on
every
occasion
supply
the
expedition
with
weather
precisely
suited
to
its
wants
it
is
thought
says
this
singular
document
that
louisbourg
may
be
surprised
if
they
the
french
have
no
advice
of
your
coming
to
effect
it
you
must
time
your
arrival
about
nine
of
the
clock
in
the
evening
taking
care
that
the
fleet
be
far
enough
in
the
offing
to
prevent
their
being
seen
from
the
town
in
the
he
then
goes
on
to
prescribe
how
the
troops
are
to
land
after
dark
at
a
place
called
flat
point
cove
in
four
divisions
three
of
which
are
to
march
to
the
back
of
certain
hills
a
mile
and
a
half
west
of
the
town
where
two
of
the
three
are
to
halt
and
keep
a
profound
silence
the
third
continuing
its
march
under
cover
of
the
said
hills
till
it
comes
opposite
the
grand
battery
which
it
will
attack
at
a
concerted
signal
while
one
of
the
two
divisions
behind
the
hills
assaults
the
west
gate
and
the
other
moves
up
to
support
the
attack
while
this
is
going
on
the
soldiers
of
the
fourth
division
are
to
march
with
all
speed
along
the
shore
till
they
come
to
a
certain
part
of
the
town
wall
which
they
are
to
scale
then
proceed
as
fast
as
can
be
to
the
citadel
and
secure
the
windows
of
the
governor
s
after
this
follow
page
after
page
of
complicated
details
which
must
have
stricken
the
general
with
stupefaction
the
rocks
surf
fogs
and
gales
of
that
tempestuous
coast
are
all
left
out
of
the
account
and
so
too
is
the
nature
of
the
country
which
consists
of
deep
marshes
rocky
hills
and
hollows
choked
with
evergreen
thickets
yet
a
series
of
complex
and
mutually
dependent
operations
involving
long
marches
through
this
rugged
and
pathless
region
was
to
be
accomplished
in
the
darkness
of
one
april
night
by
raw
soldiers
who
knew
nothing
of
the
country
this
rare
specimen
of
amateur
soldiering
is
redeemed
in
some
measure
by
a
postscript
in
which
the
governor
sets
free
the
hands
of
the
general
thus
notwithstanding
the
instructions
you
have
received
from
me
i
must
leave
you
to
act
upon
unforeseen
emergencies
according
to
your
best

the

the
fleet
consisting
of
about
ninety
transports
escorted
by
the
provincial
cruisers

from

by

it
goes

and
the

came
dropping
in
from

to

sorely
buffeted
but
all
safe
on
sunday
there
was
a
great
concourse
to
hear
parson

preach
an
sermon
from
the
text

exercising
som
a
hearing
the
attention
of
parson
moody
s
listeners
was
in
fact
distracted
by
shouts
of
command
and
the
awkward
drill
of
squads
of
homespun
soldiers
on
the
adjacent
pasture
captain
ammi
cutter
with
two
companies
was
ordered
to
remain
at
canseau
and
defend
it
from
farther
vicissitudes
to
which
end
a
blockhouse
was
also
built
and
mounted
with
eight
small
cannon
some
of
the
armed
vessels
had
been
set
to
cruise
off
louisbourg
which
they
did
to
good
purpose
and
presently
brought
in
six
french
prizes
with
supplies
for
the
fortress
on
the
other
hand
they
brought
the
ominous
news
that
louisbourg
and
the
adjoining
bay
were
so
blocked
with
ice
that
landing
was
impossible
this
was
a
serious
misfortune
involving
long
delay
and
perhaps
ruin
to
the
expedition
as
the
expected
might
arrive
meanwhile
from
france
indeed
they
had
already
begun
to
appear
on
thursday
the
eighteenth
heavy
cannonading
was
heard
far
out
at
sea
and
again
on
friday
the
cannon
says
pomeroy
fired
at
a
great
rate
till
about
of
the
it
was
the
provincial
cruisers
attacking
a
french
frigate
the
renommée
of
guns
as
their
united
force
was
too
much
for
her
she
kept
up
a
running
fight
outsailed
them
and
escaped
after
a
chase
of
more
than
thirty
hours
being
as
pomeroy
quaintly
observes
a
smart
she
carried
despatches
to
the
governor
of
louisbourg
and
being
unable
to
deliver
them
sailed
back
for
france
to
report
what
she
had
seen
on
monday
the
a
clear
cold
windy
day
a
large
ship
under
british
colors
sailed
into
the
harbor
and
proved
to
be
the
frigate
eltham
escort
to
the
annual
mast
fleet
from
new
england
on
orders
from
commander
warren
she
had
left
her
charge
in
waiting
and
sailed
for
canseau
to
join
the
expedition
bringing
the
unexpected
and
welcome
news
that
warren
himself
would
soon
follow
on
the
next
day
to
the
delight
of
all
he
appeared
in
the
ship
superbe
of
sixty
guns
accompanied
by
the
launceston
and
the
mermaid
of
forty
guns
each
here
was
force
enough
to
oppose
any
ships
likely
to
come
to
the
aid
of
louisbourg
and
warren
after
communicating
with
pepperrell
sailed
to
blockade
the
port
along
with
the
provincial
cruisers
which
by
order
of
shirley
were
placed
under
his
command
the
transports
lay
at
canseau
nearly
three
weeks
waiting
for
the
ice
to
break
up
the
time
was
passed
in
drilling
the
raw
soldiers
and
forming
them
into
divisions
of
four
and
six
hundred
each
according
to
the
directions
of
shirley
at
length
on
friday
the
they
heard
that
gabarus
bay
was
free
from
ice
and
on
the
morning
of
the
with
the
first
fair
wind
they
sailed
out
of
canseau
harbor
expecting
to
reach
louisbourg
at
nine
in
the
evening
as
prescribed
in
the
governor
s
receipt
for
taking
louisbourg
while
the
enemy
were
but
a
lull
in
the
wind
defeated
this
plan
and
after
sailing
all
day
they
found
themselves
becalmed
towards
night
it
was
not
till
the
next
morning
that
they
could
see
the
town
no
very
imposing
spectacle
for
the
buildings
with
a
few
exceptions
were
small
and
the
massive
ramparts
that
belted
them

eastward
by
reefs
and
shoals
that
partly
barred
the
entrance
to
the

leaving
a
navigable
passage
not
half
a
mile
wide
this
passage
was
commanded
by
a
powerful
battery
called
the
island
battery
being
upon
a
small
rocky
island
at
the
west
side
of
the
channel
and
was
also
secured
by
another
detached
work
called
the
grand
or
royal
battery
which
stood
on
the
shore
of
the
harbor
opposite
the
entrance
and
more
than
a
mile
from
the
town
thus
a
hostile
squadron
trying
to
force
its
way
in
would
receive
a
flank
fire
from
the
one
battery
and
a
front
fire
from
the
other
the
strongest
line
of
defence
of
the
fortress
was
drawn
across
the
base
of
the
tongue
of
land
from
the
harbor
on
one
side
to
the
sea
on
the
other
a
distance
of
about
twelve
hundred
yards
the
ditch
was
eighty
feet
wide
and
from
thirty
to
feet
deep
and
the
rampart
of
earth
faced
with
masonry
was
about
sixty
feet
thick
the
glacis
sloped
down
to
a
vast
marsh
which
formed
one
of
the
best
defences
of
the
place
the
fortress
without
counting
its
outworks
had
embrasures
for
one
hundred
and
cannon
but
the
number
in
position
was
much
less
and
is
variously
stated
pomeroy
says
that
at
the
end
of
the
siege
a
little
above
ninety
were
found
with
a
great
number
of
swivels
others
say
in
the
grand
and
island
batteries
there
were
sixty
heavy
pieces
more
against
this
formidable
armament
the
assailants
had
brought
cannon
and
mortars
of
much
inferior
weight
to
be
used
in
bombarding
the
fortress
should
they
chance
to
fail
of
carrying
it
by
surprise
while
the
enemy
were
apparently
they
distrusted
the
efficacy
of
their
though
it
was
far
stronger
than
shirley
had
at
first
thought
sufficient
for
they
brought
with
them
good
store
of
balls
of
pounds
to
be
used
in
french
cannon
of
that
calibre
which
they
expected
to
capture
their
own
largest
pieces
being
but
according
to
the
de
the
garrison
consisted
of
five
hundred
and
sixty
regular
troops
of
whom
several
companies
were
swiss
besides
some
thirteen
or
fourteen
hundred
militia
inhabitants
partly
of
the
town
and
partly
of
neighboring
settlements
the
regulars
were
in
bad
condition
about
the
preceding
christmas
they
had
broken
into
mutiny
being
discontented
with
their
rations
and
exasperated
with
getting
no
extra
pay
for
work
on
the
fortifications
the
affair
was
so
serious
that
though
order
was
restored
some
of
the
officers
lost
all
confidence
in
the
soldiers
and
this
distrust
proved
most
unfortunate
during
the
siege
the
governor
chevalier
duchambon
successor
of
duquesnel
who
had
died
in
the
autumn
was
not
a
man
to
grapple
with
a
crisis
being
deficient
in
decision
of
character
if
not
in
capacity
he
expected
an
attack
we
were
informed
of
the
preparations
from
the
first
says
the
de
some
indians
who
had
been
to
boston
carried
to
canada
the
news
of
what
was
going
on
there
but
it
was
not
believed
and
excited
no
alarm
it
was
not
so
at
louisbourg
where
says
the
french
writer
just
quoted
we
lost
precious
moments
in
useless
deliberations
and
resolutions
no
sooner
made
than
broken
nothing
to
the
purpose
was
done
so
that
we
were
as
much
taken
by
surprise
as
if
the
enemy
had
pounced
upon
us
it
was
about
the
of
march
when
the
garrison
first
saw
the
provincial
cruisers
hovering
off
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
they
continued
to
do
so
at
intervals
till
daybreak
of
the
thirtieth
of
april
when
the
whole
fleet
of
transports
appeared
standing
towards
flat
point
which
projects
into
gabarus
bay
three
miles
west
of
the
town
on
this
duchambon
sent
morpain
captain
of
a
privateer
or
corsair
to
oppose
the
landing
he
had
with
him
eighty
men
and
was
to
be
joined
by
forty
more
already
on
the
watch
near
the
supposed
point
of
disembarkation
at
the
same
time
cannon
were
fired
and
alarm
bells
rung
in
louisbourg
to
call
in
the
militia
of
the
neighborhood
pepperrell
managed
the
critical
work
of
landing
with
creditable
skill
the
rocks
and
the
surf
were
more
dangerous
than
the
enemy
several
boats
filled
with
men
rowed
towards
flat
point
but
on
a
signal
from
the
flagship
shirley
rowed
back
again
morpain
flattering
himself
that
his
appearance
had
frightened
them
off
being
joined
by
several
other
boats
the
united
party
a
hundred
men
in
all
pulled
for
another
called
cove
or
anse
de
la
cormorandière
two
miles
farther
up
gabarus
bay
morpain
and
his
party
ran
to
meet
them
but
the
boats
were
first
in
the
race
and
as
soon
as
the
new
england
men
got
ashore
they
rushed
upon
the
french
killed
six
of
them
captured
as
many
more
including
an
officer
named
boularderie
and
put
the
rest
to
flight
with
the
loss
on
their
own
side
of
two
men
slightly
wounded
further
resistance
to
the
landing
was
impossible
for
a
swarm
of
boats
pushed
against
the
rough
and
stony
beach
the
men
dashing
through
the
surf
till
before
night
about
two
thousand
were
on
shore
the
rest
or
about
two
thousand
more
landed
at
their
leisure
on
the
next
day
on
the
second
of
may
vaughan
led
four
hundred
men
to
the
hills
near
the
town
and
saluted
it
with
three
cheers
somewhat
to
the
discomposure
of
the
french
though
they
described
the
unwelcome
visitors
as
a
disorderly
crowd
vaughan
s
next
proceeding
pleased
them
still
less
he
marched
behind
the
hills
in
rear
of
the
grand

the
northeast
arm
of

where
there
were
extensive
magazines
of
naval
stores
these
his
men
set
on
fire
and
the
pitch
tar
and
other
combustibles
made
a
prodigious
smoke
he
was
returning
in
the
morning
with
a
small
party
of
followers
behind
the
hills
when
coming
opposite
the
grand
battery
and
observing
it
from
the
ridge
he
saw
neither
flag
on
the
flagstaff
nor
smoke
from
the
barrack
chimneys
one
of
his
party
was
a
cape
cod
indian
vaughan
bribed
him
with
a
flask
of
brandy
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
though
as
the
clerical
historian
takes
pains
to
assure
us
he
never
used
it
himself
and
the
indian
pretending
to
be
drunk
or
as
some
say
mad
staggered
towards
the
battery
to
reconnoitre
all
was
quiet
he
clambered
in
at
an
embrasure
and
found
the
place
empty
the
rest
of
the
party
followed
and
one
of
them
william

a
boy
of
eighteen
climbed
the
flagstaff
holding
in
his
teeth
his
red
coat
which
he
made
fast
at
the
top
as
a
substitute
for
the
british
flag
a
proceeding
that
drew
upon
him
a
volley
of
unsuccessful
from
the
town
batteries
vaughan
then
sent
this
hasty
note
to
pepperrell
may
it
please
your
honour
to
be
informed
that
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
courage
of
men
i
entered
the
royal
battery
about
o
clock
and
am
waiting
for
a
reinforcement
and
a
soon
after
four
boats
filled
with
men
approached
from
the
town
to
reoccupy
the
battery
no
doubt
in
order
to
save
the
munitions
and
stores
and
complete
the
destruction
of
the
cannon
vaughan
and
his
thirteen
men
standing
on
the
open
beach
under
the
fire
of
the
town
and
the
island
battery
plied
the
boats
with
musketry
and
kept
them
from
landing
till
bradstreet
appeared
with
a
reinforcement
on
which
the
french
pulled
back
to
louisbourg
the
english
supposed
that
the
french
in
the
battery
when
the
clouds
of
smoke
drifted
over
them
from
the
burning
storehouses
thought
that
they
were
to
be
attacked
in
force
and
abandoned
their
post
in
a
panic
this
was
not
the
case
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
writes
the
de
advanced
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
royal
this
was
vaughan
s
four
hundred
on
their
way
to
burn
the
storehouses
at
once
we
were
all
seized
with
fright
pursues
this
candid
writer
and
on
the
instant
it
was
proposed
to
abandon
this
magnificent
battery
which
would
have
been
our
best
defence
if
one
had
known
how
to
use
it
various
councils
were
held
in
a
tumultuous
way
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
the
reasons
for
such
a
strange
proceeding
not
one
shot
had
yet
been
fired
at
the
battery
which
the
enemy
could
not
take
except
by
making
regular
approaches
as
if
against
the
town
itself
and
by
besieging
it
so
to
speak
in
form
some
persons
remonstrated
but
in
vain
and
so
a
battery
of
thirty
cannon
which
had
cost
the
king
immense
sums
was
abandoned
before
it
was
duchambon
says
that
soon
after
the
english
landed
he
got
a
letter
from
thierry
the
captain
in
command
of
the
royal
battery
advising
that
the
cannon
should
be
spiked
and
the
works
blown
up
it
was
then
according
to
the
governor
that
the
council
was
called
and
a
unanimous
vote
passed
to
follow
thierry
s
advice
on
the
ground
that
the
defences
of
the
battery
were
in
bad
condition
and
that
the
four
hundred
men
posted
there
could
not
stand
against
three
or
four
thousand
the
engineer
verrier
opposed
the
blowing
up
of
the
works
and
they
were
therefore
left
untouched
thierry
and
his
garrison
came
off
in
boats
after
spiking
the
cannon
in
a
hasty
way
without
stopping
to
knock
off
the
trunnions
or
burn
the
carriages
they
threw
their
loose
gunpowder
into
the
well
but
left
behind
a
good
number
of
cannon
cartridges
two
hundred
and
eighty
large
bombshells
and
other
ordinance
stores
invaluable
both
to
the
enemy
and
to
themselves
brigadier
waldo
was
sent
to
occupy
the
battery
with
his
regiment
and
major
seth
pomeroy
the
gunsmith
with
twenty
was
set
at
drilling
out
the
spiked
of
the
cannon
there
were
and
two
several
were
ready
for
use
the
next
morning
and
immediately
opened
on
the
town
which
writes
a
soldier
in
his
diary
damaged
the
houses
and
made
the
women
the
enemy
says
the
de
saluted
us
with
our
own
cannon
and
made
a
terrific
fire
smashing
everything
within
the
english
occupation
of
the
grand
battery
may
be
called
the
decisive
event
of
the
siege
there
seems
no
doubt
that
the
french
could
have
averted
the
disaster
long
enough
to
make
it
of
little
help
to
the
invaders
the
of
the
battery
was
impregnable
the
rear
defences
consisted
of
a
loopholed
wall
of
masonry
with
a
ditch
ten
feet
deep
and
twelve
feet
wide
and
also
a
covered
way
and
glacis
which
general
wolcott
describes
as
unfinished
in
this
he
mistook
they
were
not
unfinished
but
had
been
partly
demolished
with
a
view
to
reconstruction
the
rear
wall
was
flanked
by
two
towers
which
says
duchambon
were
demolished
but
general
wolcott
declares
that
swivels
were
still
mounted
on
them
and
he
adds
that
two
hundred
men
might
hold
the
battery
against
five
thousand
without
the
english
landed
their
cannon
near
flat
point
and
before
they
could
be
turned
against
the
grand
battery
they
must
be
dragged
four
miles
over
hills
and
rocks
through
spongy
marshes
and
jungles
of
matted
evergreens
this
would
have
required
a
week
or
more
the
alternative
was
an
escalade
in
which
the
undisciplined
assailants
would
no
doubt
have
met
a
bloody
rebuff
thus
this
grand
battery
which
says
wolcott
is
in
fact
a
fort
might
at
least
have
been
held
long
enough
to
save
the
munitions
and
stores
and
effectually
disable
the
cannon
which
supplied
the
english
with
the
only
artillery
they
had
competent
to
the
work
before
them
the
hasty
abandonment
of
this
important
post
was
not
duchambon
s
only
blunder
but
it
was
the
worst
of
them
all
on
the
night
after
their
landing
the
new
england
men
slept
in
the
woods
wet
or
dry
with
or
without
blankets
as
the
case
might
be
and
in
the
morning
set
themselves
to
encamping
with
as
much
order
as
they
were
capable
of
a
brook
ran
down
from
the
hills
and
entered
the
sea
two
miles
or
more
from
the
town
the
ground
on
each
side
though
rough
was
high
and
dry
and
here
most
of
the
regiments
made
their
quarters
willard
s
moulton
s
and
moore
s
on
the
east
side
and
burr
s
and
pepperrell
s
on
the
west
those
on
the
east
in
some
cases
saw
fit
to
extend
themselves
towards
louisbourg
as
far
as
the
edge
of
the
intervening
marsh
but
were
soon
forced
back
to
a
safer
position
by
the
of
the
fortress
which
came
bowling
amongst
them
this
marsh
was
that
green
flat
sponge
of
mud
and
moss
that
stretched
from
this
point
to
the
glacis
of
louisbourg
there
was
great
want
of
tents
for
material
to
make
them
was
scarce
in
new
england
old
sails
were
often
used
instead
being
stretched
over
poles
perhaps
after
the
fashion
of
a
sioux
teepee
when
these
could
not
be
had
the
men
built
huts
of
sods
with
roofs
of
overlapping
like
a
thatch
for
at
that
early
season
bark
would
not
peel
from
the
trees
the
landing
of
guns
munitions
and
stores
was
a
formidable
task
consuming
many
days
and
destroying
many
boats
as
happened
again
when
amherst
landed
his
cannon
at
this
same
place
large
flat
boats
brought
from
boston
were
used
for
the
purpose
and
the
loads
were
carried
ashore
on
the
heads
of
the
men
wading
through
surf
to
the
waist
after
which
having
no
change
of
clothing
they
slept
on
the
ground
through
the
chill
and
foggy
nights
reckless
of
future
rheumatisms
a
worse
task
was
before
them
the
cannon
were
to
be
dragged
over
the
marsh
to
green
hill
a
spur
of
the
line
of
rough
heights
that
half
encircled
the
town
and
harbor
here
the
first
battery
was
to
be
planted
and
from
this
point
other
guns
were
to
be
dragged
onward
to
more
advanced
stations
a
distance
in
all
of
more
than
two
miles
thought
by
the
french
to
be
impassable
so
in
fact
it
seemed
for
at
the
first
attempt
the
wheels
of
the
cannon
sank
to
the
hubs
in
mud
and
moss
then
the
carriage
and
finally
the
piece
itself
slowly
disappeared
meserve
of
the
new
hampshire
regiment
a
by
trade
presently
overcame
the
difficulty
by
his
direction
sledges
of
timber
were
made
sixteen
feet
long
and
five
feet
wide
a
cannon
was
placed
on
each
of
these
and
it
was
then
dragged
over
the
marsh
by
a
team
of
two
hundred
men
harnessed
with
and
and
wading
to
the
knees
horses
or
oxen
would
have
foundered
in
the
mire
the
way
had
often
to
be
changed
as
the
mossy
surface
was
soon
churned
into
a
hopeless
slough
along
the
line
of
march
the
work
could
be
done
only
at
night
or
in
thick
fog
the
men
being
completely
exposed
to
the
cannon
of
the
town
thirteen
years
after
when
general
amherst
besieged
louisbourg
again
he
dragged
his
cannon
to
the
same
hill
over
the
same
marsh
but
having
at
his
command
instead
of
four
thousand
militiamen
eleven
thousand
british
regulars
with
all
appliances
and
means
to
boot
he
made
a
road
with
prodigious
labor
through
the
mire
and
protected
it
from
the
french
shot
by
an
epaulement
or
lateral
earthwork
pepperrell
writes
in
ardent
words
of
the
cheerfulness
of
his
men
under
almost
incredible
shoes
and
clothing
failed
till
many
were
in
tatters
and
many
barefooted
yet
they
toiled
on
with
unconquerable
spirit
and
within
four
days
had
planted
a
battery
of
six
guns
on
green
hill
which
was
about
a
mile
from
the
king
s
bastion
of
louisbourg
in
another
week
they
had
dragged
four
cannon
and
ten
coehorns
gravely
called
cowhorns
by
the
bucolic
pomeroy
six
or
seven
hundred
yards
farther
and
planted
them
within
easy
range
of
the
citadel
two
of
the
cannon
burst
and
were
replaced
by
four
more
and
a
large
mortar
which
burst
in
its
turn
and
shirley
was
begged
to
send
another
meanwhile
a
battery
chiefly
of
coehorns
had
been
planted
on
a
hillock
four
hundred
and
forty
yards
from
the
west
gate
where
it
greatly
annoyed
the
french
and
on
the
next
night
an
advanced
battery
was
placed
just
opposite
the
same
gate
and
scarcely
two
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
it
this
west
gate
the
principal
gate
of
louisbourg
opened
upon
the
tract
of
high
firm
ground
that
lay
on
the
left
of
the
besiegers
between
the
marsh
and
the
harbor
an
arm
of
which
here
extended
westward
beyond
the
town
into
what
was
called
the
barachois
a
salt
pond
formed
by
a
projecting
spit
of
sand
on
the
side
of
the
barachois
farthest
from
the
town
was
a
hillock
on
which
stood
the
house
of
an
named
martissan
here
on
the
twentieth
of
may
a
fifth
battery
was
planted
consisting
of
two
of
the
french
taken
in
the
grand
battery
to
which
three
others
were
afterwards
added
each
of
these
heavy
pieces
was
dragged
to
its
destination
by
a
team
of
three
hundred
men
over
rough
and
rocky
ground
swept
by
the
french
artillery
this
fifth
battery
called
the
northwest
or
titcomb
s
proved
most
destructive
to
the
fortress
all
these
operations
were
accomplished
with
the
utmost
ardor
and
energy
but
with
a
scorn
of
rule
and
precedent
that
astonished
and
bewildered
the
french
the
raw
new
england
men
went
their
own
way
laughed
at
trenches
and
zigzags
and
persisted
in
trusting
their
lives
to
the
night
and
the
fog
several
writers
say
that
the
english
engineer
bastide
tried
to
teach
them
discretion
but
this
could
hardly
be
for
bastide
whose
station
was
annapolis
did
not
reach
louisbourg
till
the
fifth
of
june
when
the
batteries
were
finished
and
the
siege
was
nearly
ended
a
recent
french
writer
makes
the
curious
assertion
that
it
was
one
of
the
ministers
or
army
chaplains
who
took
upon
him
the
vain
task
of
instruction
in
the
art
of
war
on
this
occasion
this
ignorant
and
recklessness
might
have
cost
the
besiegers
dear
if
the
french
instead
of
being
perplexed
and
startled
at
the
novelty
of
their
proceedings
had
taken
advantage
of
it
but
duchambon
and
some
of
his
officers
remembering
the
mutiny
of
the
past
winter
feared
to
make
sorties
lest
the
soldiers
might
desert
or
take
part
with
the
enemy
the
danger
of
this
appears
to
have
been
small
warren
speaks
with
wonder
in
his
letters
of
the
rarity
of
desertions
of
which
there
appear
to
have
been
but
three
during
the
siege
one
being
that
of
a
from
whom
no
information
could
be
got
a
bolder
commander
would
not
have
stood
idle
while
his
own
cannon
were
planted
by
the
enemy
to
batter
down
his
walls
and
whatever
the
risks
of
a
sortie
the
risks
of
not
making
one
were
greater
both
troops
and
militia
eagerly
demanded
it
and
i
believe
it
would
have
succeeded
writes
the
intendant
bigot
the
attempt
was
actually
made
more
than
once
in
a
way
notably
on
the
eighth
of
may
when
the
french
attacked
the
most
advanced
battery
and
were
repulsed
with
little
loss
on
either
side
the
de
says
the
enemy
did
not
attack
us
with
any
regularity
and
made
no
intrenchments
to
cover
this
last
is
not
exact
not
being
wholly
demented
they
made
intrenchments
such
as
they
were
at
least
at
the
advanced
battery
as
they
would
otherwise
have
been
swept
out
of
existence
being
under
the
concentred
fire
of
several
french
batteries
two
of
which
were
within
the
range
of

s

and

and

the
scarcity
of
good
gunners
was
one
of
the
chief
difficulties
of
the
besiegers
as
privateering
and
piracy
also
against
frenchmen
and
spaniards
was
a
favorite
pursuit
in
new
england
there
were
men
in
pepperrell
s
army
who
knew
how
to
handle
cannon
but
their
number
was
insufficient
and
the
general
sent
a
note
to
warren
begging
that
he
would
lend
him
a
few
experienced
gunners
to
teach
their
trade
to
the
raw
hands
at
the
batteries
three
or
four
were
sent
and
they
found
apt
pupils
pepperrell
placed
the
advanced
battery
in
charge
of
captain
joseph
sherburn
telling
him
to
enlist
as
many
gunners
as
he
could
on
the
next
day
sherburn
reported
that
he
had
found
six
one
of
whom
seems
to
have
been
sent
by
warren
with
these
and
a
number
of
raw
men
he
repaired
to
his
perilous
station
where
i
found
he
says
a
very
poor
intrenchment
our
best
shelter
from
the
french
fire
which
was
very
hot
was
hogsheads
filled
with

his

made
the
west
gate
their

mark
but
before
they
could
get
a
fair
sight
of
it
they
were
forced
to
shoot
down
the
or
stages
for
drying
cod
that
obstructed
the
view
some
of
their
party
were
soon
killed
captain

by
a

by

by

in
the
night
they
improved
their

and
mounted
on
them
three
more
guns
one
of
calibre
and
the
others
of
french
pieces
dragged
from
the
grand

a

quarters
round

the

could
be
loaded
only
under
a
constant

the

briskly
returned

in

mounted

sunday
morning
began
our
fire
with
as
much
fury
as
possible
and
the
french
returned
it
as
warmly
from
the
citidale
citadel
west
gate
and
north
east
battery
with
cannon
mortars
and
continual
showers
of
musket
balls
but
by
o
clock
we
had
beat
them
all
from
their
he
goes
on
to
say
that
at
noon
his
men
were
forced
to
stop
firing
from
want
of
powder
that
he
went
with
his
gunners
to
get
some
and
that
while
they
were
gone
somebody
said
to
be
vaughan
brought
a
supply
on
which
the
men
loaded
the
pounders
in
a
bungling
way
and
fired
them
one
was
dismounted
and
the
other
burst

to

some
directions

with

seeing
our

tumble
down
their
walls
and
flagg
the
following
is
the
intendant
bigot
s
account
of
the
effect
of
the
new
england
fire
the
enemy
established
their
batteries
to
such
effect
that
they
soon
destroyed
the
greater
part
of
the
town
broke
the
right
flank
of
the
king
s
bastion
ruined
the
dauphin
battery
with
its
spur
and
made
a
breach
at
the
porte
dauphine
west
gate
the
neighboring
wall
and
the
sort
of
redan
duchambon
says
in
addition
that
the
cannon
of
the
right
flank
of
the
king
s
bastion
could
not
be
served
by
reason
of
the
continual
fire
of
the
enemy
which
broke
the
embrasures
to
pieces
that
when
he
had
them
repaired
they
were
broken
to
pieces
again
and
nobody
could
keep
his
ground
behind
the
wall
of
the
quay
which
was
shot
through
and
through
and
completely
riddled
the
town
was
ploughed
with
the
streets
were
raked
from
end
to
end
nearly
all
the
houses
damaged
and
the
people
driven
for
refuge
into
the
stifling
casemates
the
results
were
creditable
to
novices
in
gunnery
the
repeated
accidents
from
the
bursting
of
cannon
were
no
doubt
largely
due
to
unskilful
loading
and
the
practice
of
to
which
the
artillerists
are
said
to
have
often
resorted
it
is
said
in
proof
of
the
orderly
conduct
of
the
men
that
not
one
of
them
was
punished
during
all
the
siege
but
this
shows
the
mild
and
conciliating
character
of
the
general
quite
as
much
as
any
peculiar
merit
of
the
soldiers
the
state
of
things
in
and
about
the
camp
was
compared
by
the
caustic
douglas
to
a
cambridge
commencement
which
academic
festival
was
then
attended
by
much
rough
frolic
and
boisterous
horseplay
among
the
disorderly
crowds
white
and
black
bond
and
free
who
swarmed
among
the
booths
on
cambridge
common
the
careful
and
scrupulous
belknap
who
knew
many
who
took
part
in
the
siege
says
those
who
were
on
the
spot
have
frequently
in
my
hearing
laughed
at
the
recital
of
their
own
irregularities
and
expressed
their
admiration
when
they
reflected
on
the
almost
miraculous
preservation
of
the
army
from
while
the
cannon
bellowed
in
the
front
frolic
and
confusion
reigned
at
the
camp
where
the
men
raced
wrestled
pitched
quoits
fired
at
marks
though
there
was
no
ammunition
to
spare
and
ran
after
the
french
which
were
carried
to
the
batteries
to
be
returned
to
those
who
sent
them
nor
were
calmer
recreations
wanting
some
of
our
men
went
a
fishing
about
miles
off
writes
lieutenant
benjamin
cleaves
in
his
diary
caught
and
on
the
same
day
our
men
went
to
catch
lobsters
caught
in
view
of
this
truant
disposition
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
besiegers
now
and
then
lost
their
scalps
at
the
hands
of
prowling
indians
who
infested
the
neighborhood
yet
through
all
these
gambols
ran
an
undertow
of
enthusiasm
born
in
brains
still
fevered
from
the
great
the
new
england
soldier
a
growth
of
sectarian
hotbeds
fancied
that
he
was
doing
the
work
of
god
the
army
was
israel
and
the
french
were
canaanitish
idolaters
calvinism
acting
through
generations
had
modified
the
transplanted
englishman
and
the
descendant
of
the
puritans
was
never
so
well
pleased
as
when
teaching
their
duty
to
other
people
whether
by
pen
voice
or
bombshells
the
ragged
artillerymen
battering
the
walls
of
papistical
louisbourg
flattered
themselves
with
the
notion
that
they
were
champions
of
gospel
truth
barefoot
and
tattered
they
toiled
on
with
indomitable
pluck
and
cheerfulness
doing
the
work
which
oxen
could
not
do
with
no
comfort
but
their
daily
dram
of
new
england
rum
as
they
plodded
through
the
marsh
and
over
rocks
dragging
the
ponderous
guns
through
fog
and
darkness
their
spirit
could
not
save
them
from
the
effects
of
excessive
fatigue
and
exposure
they
were
ravaged
with
diarrhœa
and
fever
till
fifteen
hundred
men
were
at
one
time
on
the
and
at
another
pepperrell
reported
that
of
the
four
thousand
only
about
hundred
were
fit
for
duty
nearly
all
at
last
recovered
for
the
weather
was
unusually
good
yet
the
number
fit
for
service
was
absurdly
small
pepperrell
begged
for
reinforcements
but
got
none
till
the
siege
was
ended
it
was
not
his
nature
to
rule
with
a
stiff
hand
and
this
perhaps
was
fortunate
order
and
discipline
the
sinews
of
an
army
were
out
of
the
question
and
it
remained
to
do
as
well
as
might
be
without
them
keep
men
and
officers
in
and
avoid
all
that
could
dash
their
ardor
for
this
at
least
the
was
well
fitted
his
popularity
had
helped
to
raise
the
army
and
perhaps
it
helped
now
to
make
it
efficient
his
position
was
no
bed
of
roses
worries
small
and
great
pursued
him
without
end
he
made
friends
of
his
officers
kept
a
bountiful
table
at
his
tent
and
labored
to
soothe
their
disputes
and
jealousies
and
satisfy
their
complaints
so
generous
were
his
contributions
to
the
common
cause
that
according
to
a
british
officer
who
speaks
highly
of
his
services
he
gave
to
it
in
one
form
or
another
out
of
his
own
pocket
his
reveal
a
swarm
of
petty
annoyances
which
may
have
tried
his
strength
and
patience
as
much
as
more
serious
cares
the
soldiers
complained
that
they
were
left
without
clothing
shoes
or
rum
and
when
he
implored
the
committee
of
war
to
send
them
osborne
the
chairman
replied
with
explanations
why
it
could
not
be
done
letters
came
from
wives
and
fathers
entreating
that
husbands
and
sons
who
had
gone
to
the
war
should
be
sent
back
at
the
end
of
the
siege
a
captain
humble
begs
leave
for
to
go
home
because
he
lives
in
a
very
dangerous
country
and
his
wife
and
children
are
in
a
declining
way
without
him
then
two
entire
companies
raised
on
the
frontier
offered
the
same
petition
on
similar
grounds
sometimes
pepperrell
was
beset
with
prayers
for
favors
and
promotion
sometimes
with
complaints
from
one
corps
or
another
that
an
undue
share
of
work
had
been
imposed

brought
countless
letters
of
congratulation
which
whether
lay
or
clerical
never
failed
to
remind
him
in
set
phrases
that
he
was
but
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
one
of
his
most
persistent
correspondents
was
his
nathaniel
sparhawk
a
thrifty
merchant
with
a
constant
eye
to
business
who
generally
began
his
epistles
with
a
bulletin
concerning
the
health
of
mother
pepperrell
and
rarely
ended
them
without
charging
his
with
some
commission
such
as
buying
for
him
the
cargo
of
a
french
prize
if
he
could
get
it
cheap
or
thus
if
you
would
procure
for
me
a
hogshead
of
the
best
clarett
and
a
hogshead
of
the
best
white
wine
at
a
reasonable
rate
it
would
be
very
grateful
to
after
pestering
him
with
a
few
other
commissions
he
tells
him
that
andrew
and
bettsy
children
of
pepperrell
send
their
proper
compliments

flourish

your

annoyed
by

unaccountable

of

to
duchambon
who
replied
that
he
would

two
days
after
we
find
in

record
of
the
council
the
following
startling
entry
advised
unanimously
that
the
town
of
louisbourg
be
attacked
by
storm
this
vaughan
was
a
member
of
the
board
and
perhaps
his
impetuous
rashness
had
turned
the
heads
of
his
colleagues
to
storm
the
fortress
at
that
time
would
have
been
a
desperate
attempt
for
the
and
troops
there
was
as
yet
no
breach
in
the
walls
nor
the
beginning
of
one
and
the
french
were
so
confident
in
the
strength
of
their
fortifications
that
they
boasted
that
women
alone
could
defend
them
nine
in
ten
of
the
men
had
no
bayonets
many
had
no
shoes
and
it
is
said
that
the
they
had
brought
from
boston
were
ten
feet
too
short
perhaps
it
was
unfortunate
for
the
french
that
the
army
was
more
prudent
than
its
leaders
and
another
council
being
called
on
the
same
day
it
was
advised
that
inasmuch
as
there
appears
a
great
dissatisfaction
in
many
of
the
officers
and
soldiers
at
the
designed
attack
of
the
town
by
storm
this
night
the
said
attack
be
deferred
for
the
another
plan
was
adopted
hardly
less
critical
though
it
found
favor
with
the
army
this
was
the
assault
of
the
island
battery
which
closed
the
entrance
of
the
harbor
to
the
british
squadron
and
kept
it
open
to
ships
from
france
nobody
knew
precisely
how
to
find
the
two
of
this
formidable
work
which
were
narrow
gaps
between
rocks
lashed
with
almost
constant
surf
but
vaughan
would
see
no
difficulties
and
wrote
to
pepperrell
that
if
he
would
give
him
the
command
and
leave
him
to
manage
the
attack
in
his
own
way
he
would
engage
to
send
the
french
flag
to
headquarters
within
hours
on
the
next
day
he
seems
to
have
thought
the
command
assured
to
him
and
writes
from
the
grand
battery
that
the
carpenters
are
at
work
mending
and
making
paddles
asking
at
the
same
time
for
plenty
of
pistols
and
one
hundred
with
men
who
know
how
to
use
them
the
weather
proved
bad
and
the
attempt
was
deferred
this
happened
several
times
till
warren
grew
impatient
and
offered
to
support
the
attack
with
two
hundred
sailors
at
length
on
the
the
volunteers
for
the
perilous
enterprise
mustered
at
the
grand
battery
whence
the
boats
were
to
set
out
brigadier
waldo
who
still
commanded
there
saw
them
with
concern
and
anxiety
as
they
came
dropping
in
in
small
squads
without
officers
noisy
disorderly
and
in
some
cases
more
or
less
drunk
i
doubt
he
told
the
general
whether
straggling
fellows
three
four
or
seven
out
of
a
company
ought
to
go
on
such
a
a
bright
moon
and
northern
lights
again
put
off
the
attack
the
volunteers
remained
at
the
grand
battery
waiting
for
better
luck
they
seem
to
be
impatient
for
action
writes
waldo
if
there
were
a
more
regular
appearance
it
would
give
me
greater
on
the
their
wish
for
action
was
fully
gratified
the
night
was
still
and
dark
and
the
boats
put
out
from
the
battery
towards
twelve
o
clock
with
about
three
hundred
men
on
board
these
were
to
be
joined
by
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
fifty
more
from
gorham
s
regiment
then
stationed
at
lighthouse
point
the
commander
was
not
vaughan
but
one
brooks
the
choice
of
the
men
themselves
as
were
also
his
subordinates
they
moved
slowly
the
boats
being
propelled
not
by
oars
but
by
paddles
which
if
skilfully
used
would
make
no
noise
the
wind
presently
rose
and
when
they
found
a
the
surf
was
lashing
the
rocks
with
even
more
than
usual
fury
there
was
room
for
but
three
boats
at
once
between
the
breakers
on
each
hand
they
pushed
in
and
the
men
scrambled
ashore
with
what
speed
they
might
the
island
battery
was
a
strong
work
walled
in
on
all
sides
garrisoned
by
a
hundred
and
eighty
men
and
armed
with
thirty
cannon
seven
swivels
and
two
mortars
it
was
now
a
little
after
midnight
captain
d
aillebout
the
commandant
was
on
the
watch
pacing
the
battery
platform
but
he
seems
to
have
seen
nothing
unusual
till
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
had
got
on
shore
when
they
had
the
folly
to
announce
their
presence
by
three
cheers
then
in
the
words
of
general
wolcott
the
battery
blazed
with
cannon
swivels
and
the
crowd
of
boats
dimly
visible
through
the
darkness
as
they
lay
just
off
the
landing
waiting
their
turn
to
go
in
were
at
once
the
target
for
volleys
of
and
of
which
the
men
on
shore
had
also
their
share
these
succeeded
however
in
planting
twelve
against
the
wall
it
is
said
that
some
of
them
climbed
into
the
place
and
the
improbable
story
is
told
that
brooks
their
commander
was
hauling
down
the
french
flag
when
a
swiss
grenadier
cut
him
down
with
a
cutlass
many
of
the
boats
were
shattered
or
sunk
while
those
in
the
rear
seeing
the
state
of
things
appear
to
have
sheered
off
the
affair
was
soon
reduced
to
an
exchange
of
shots
between
the
garrison
and
the
men
who
had
landed
and
who
standing
on
the
open
ground
without
the
walls
were
not
wholly
invisible
while
the
french
behind
their
ramparts
were
completely
hidden
the
fire
of
the
english
says
bigot
was
extremely
obstinate
but
without
effect
as
they
could
not
see
to
take
they
kept
it
up
till
daybreak
or
about
two
hours
and
a
half
and
then
seeing
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
french
surrendered
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
and
nineteen
including
the
wounded
three
or
more
of
whom
died
almost
immediately
by
the
most
trustworthy
accounts
the
english
loss
in
killed
drowned
and
captured
was
one
hundred
and
or
in
the
words
of
pepperrell
nearly
half
our
disorder
precipitation
and
weak
leadership
ruined
what
hopes
the
attempt
ever
had
as
this
was
the
only
french
success
during
the
siege
duchambon
makes
the
most
of
it
he
reports
that
the
battery
was
attacked
by
a
thousand
men
supported
by
eight
hundred
more
who
were
afraid
to
show
themselves
and
farther
that
there
were
boats
all
of
which
were
destroyed
or
sunk
though
he
afterwards
says
that
two
of
them
got
away
with
thirty
men
being
all
that
were
left
of
the
thousand
bigot
more
moderate
puts
the
number
of
assailants
at
five
hundred
of
whom
he
says
that
all
perished
except
the
one
hundred
and
nineteen
who
were
captured
at
daybreak
louisbourg
rang
with
shouts
of
triumph
it
was
plain
that
a
disorderly
militia
could
not
capture
the
island
battery
yet
captured
or
silenced
it
must
be
and
orders
were
given
to
plant
a
battery
against
it
at
lighthouse
point
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
harbor
s
mouth
at
the
distance
of
a
short
the
neighboring
shore
was
rocky
and
almost
inaccessible
cannon
and
mortars
were
carried
in
boats
to
the
nearest
hauled
up
a
steep
cliff
and
dragged
a
mile
and
a
quarter
to
the
chosen
spot
where
they
were
planted
under
the
orders
of
colonel
gridley
who
thirty
years
after
directed
the
earthworks
on
bunker
hill
the
new
battery
soon
opened
fire
with
deadly
effect
the
french
much
encouraged
by
their
late
success
were
plunged
again
into
despondency
by
a
disaster
which
had
happened
a
week
before
the
affair
of
the
island
battery
but
did
not
come
to
their
knowledge
till
some
time
after
on
the
nineteenth
of
may
a
fierce
cannonade
was
heard
from
the
harbor
and
a
large
french
was
seen
hotly
engaged
with
several
vessels
of
the
squadron
she
was
the
vigilant
carrying
guns
and
men
and
commanded
by
the
marquis
de
la
maisonfort
she
had
come
from
france
with
munitions
and
stores
when
on
approaching
louisbourg
she
met
one
of
the
english
cruisers
some
say
the
mermaid
of
guns
and
others
the
shirley
of
being
no
match
for
her
the
british
or
provincial
frigate
kept
up
a
running
fight
and
led
her
towards
the
english
fleet
the
vigilant
soon
found
herself
beset
by
several
other
vessels
and
after
a
gallant
resistance
and
the
loss
of
eighty
men
struck
her
colors
nothing
could
be
more
timely
for
the
new
england
army
whose
ammunition
and
provisions
had
sunk
perilously
low
the
french
prize
now
supplied
their
needs
and
drew
from
the
de
the
mournful
comment
we
were
victims
devoted
to
appease
the
wrath
of
heaven
which
turned
our
own
arms
into
weapons
for
our
nor
was
this
the
last
time
when
the
defenders
of
louisbourg
supplied
the
instruments
of
their
own
destruction
for
ten
cannon
were
presently
unearthed
at
low
tide
from
the
flats
near
the
careening
wharf
in
the
northeast
arm
of
the
harbor
where
they
had
been
hidden
by
the
french
some
time
before
most
of
them
proved
sound
and
being
mounted
at
lighthouse
point
they
were
turned
against
their
late
owners
at
the
island
battery
when
gorham
s
regiment
first
took
post
at
lighthouse
point
duchambon
thought
the
movement
so
threatening
that
he
forgot
his
former
doubts
and
ordered
a
sortie
against
it
under
the
sieur
de
beaubassin
beaubassin
landed
with
a
hundred
men
at
a
place
called
lorembec
and
advanced
to
surprise
the
english
detachment
but
was
discovered
by
an
outpost
of
forty
men
who
attacked
and
routed
his
party
being
then
joined
by
eighty
indians
beaubassin
had
several
other
skirmishes
with
english
till
pushed
by
superior
numbers
and
their
leader
severely
wounded
his
men
regained
louisbourg
by
sea
escaping
with
difficulty
from
the
of
the
squadron
the
sieur
de
la
vallière
with
a
considerable
party
of
men
tried
to
burn
pepperrell
s
storehouses
near
flat
point
cove
but
ten
or
twelve
of
his
followers
were
captured
and
nearly
all
the
rest
wounded
various
other
petty
encounters
took
place
between
english
and
roving
bands
of
french
and
indians
always
ending
according
to
pepperrell
in
the
discomfiture
of
the
latter
to
this
however
there
was
at
least
one
exception
twenty
english
were
waylaid
and
surrounded
near
petit
lorembec
by
forty
or
fifty
indians
accompanied
by
two
or
three
frenchmen
most
of
the
english
were
shot
down
several
escaped
and
the
rest
surrendered
on
promise
of
life
upon
which
the
indians
in
cold
blood
shot
or
speared
some
of
them
and
atrociously
tortured
others
this
suggested
to
warren
a
device
which
had
two
objects
to
prevent
such
outrages
in
future
and
to
make
known
to
the
french
that
the
ship
vigilant
the
mainstay
of
their
hopes
was
in
english
hands
the
treatment
of
the
captives
was
told
to
the
marquis
de
la
maisonfort
late
captain
of
the
vigilant
now
a
prisoner
on
board
the
ship
he
had
commanded
and
he
was
requested
to
lay
the
facts
before
duchambon
this
he
did
with
great
readiness
in
a
letter
containing
these
words
it
is
well
that
you
should
be
informed
that
the
captains
and
officers
of
this
squadron
treat
us
not
as
their
prisoners
but
as
their
good
friends
and
take
particular
pains
that
my
officers
and
crew
should
want
for
nothing
therefore
it
seems
to
me
just
to
treat
them
in
like
manner
and
to
punish
those
who
do
otherwise
and
offer
any
insult
to
the
prisoners
who
may
fall
into
your
captain
m
donald
of
the
marines
carried
this
letter
to
duchambon
under
a
though
familiar
with
the
french
language
he
spoke
to
the
governor
through
an
interpreter
so
that
the
french
officers
present
who
hitherto
had
only
known
that
a
large
ship
had
been
taken
expressed
to
each
other
without
reserve
their
discouragement
and
dismay
when
they
learned
that
the
prize
was
no
other
than
the
duchambon
replied
to
la
maisonfort
s
letter
that
the
indians
alone
were
answerable
for
the
cruelties
in
question
and
that
he
would
forbid
such
conduct
for
the
future
the
besiegers
were
now
threatened
by
a
new
danger
we
have
seen
that
in
the
last
summer
the
sieur
duvivier
had
attacked
annapolis
undaunted
by
he
had
gone
to
france
to
beg
for
help
to
attack
it
again
two
thousand
men
were
promised
him
and
in
anticipation
of
their
arrival
the
governor
of
canada
sent
a
body
of
french
and
indians
under
the
noted
partisan
marin
to
meet
and
with
them
marin
was
ordered
to
wait
at
les
mines
till
he
heard
of
the
arrival
of
the
troops
from
france
but
he
grew
impatient
and
resolved
to
attack
annapolis
without
them
accordingly
he
laid
siege
to
it
with
the
six
or
seven
hundred
whites
and
indians
of
his
party
aided
by
the
acadian
neutrals
mascarene
the
governor
kept
them
at
bay
till
the
of
may
when
to
his
surprise
they
all
disappeared
duchambon
had
sent
them
an
order
to
make
all
haste
to
the
aid
of
louisbourg
as
the
report
of
this
reached
the
besiegers
multiplying
marin
s
force
fourfold
they
expected
to
be
attacked
by
numbers
more
than
equal
to
those
of
their
own
effective
men
this
wrought
a
wholesome
reform
order
was
established
in
the
camp
which
was
now
fenced
with
palisades
and
watched
by
sentinels
and
another
tribulation
fell
upon
the
general
shirley
had
enjoined
it
upon
him
to
keep
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
naval
commander
and
the
injunction
was
in
accord
with
pepperrell
s
conciliating
temper
warren
was
no
less
earnest
than
he
for
the
success
of
the
enterprise
lent
him
ammunition
in
time
of
need
and
offered
every
aid
in
his
power
while
pepperrell
in
letters
to
shirley
and
newcastle
praised
his
colleague
without
stint
but
in
habits
and
character
the
two
men
differed
widely
warren
was
in
the
prime
of
life
and
the
ardor
of
youth
still
burned
in
him
he
was
impatient
at
the
slow
movement
of
the
siege
prisoners
told
him
of
a
squadron
expected
from
brest
of
which
the
vigilant
was
the
forerunner
and
he
feared
that
even
if
it
could
not
defeat
him
it
might
elude
the
blockade
and
with
the
help
of
the
continual
fogs
get
into
louisbourg
in
spite
of
him
thus
making
its
capture
impossible
therefore
he
called
a
council
of
his
captains
on
board
his
flagship
the
superbe
and
proposed
a
plan
for
taking
the
place
without
further
delay
on
the
same
day
he
laid
it
before
pepperrell
it
was
to
the
effect
that
all
the
king
s
ships
and
provincial
cruisers
should
enter
the
harbor
after
taking
on
board
sixteen
hundred
of
pepperrell
s
men
and
attack
the
town
from
the
water
side
while
what
was
left
of
the
army
should
assault
it
by
land
to
accept
the
proposal
would
have
been
to
pass
over
the
command
to
warren
only
about
hundred
of
the
new
england
men
being
fit
for
service
at
the
time
while
of
these
the
general
informs
warren
that
six
hundred
are
gone
in
quest
of
two
bodies
of
french
and
indians
who
we
are
informed
are
gathering
one
to
the
eastward
and
the
other
to
the
to
this
warren
replies
with
some
appearance
of
pique
i
am
very
sorry
that
no
one
plan
of
mine
though
approved
by
all
my
captains
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
your
approbation
or
have
any
weight
with
and
to
show
his
title
to
consideration
he
gives
an
extract
from
a
letter
written
to
him
by
shirley
in
which
that
inveterate
flatterer
hints
his
regret
that
by
reason
of
other
employments
warren
could
not
take
command
of
the
whole
expedition
which
i
doubt
not
says
the
governor
would
be
a
most
happy
event
for
his
majesty
s
pepperrell
kept
his
temper
under
this
thrust
and
wrote
to
the
commodore
with
invincible
courtesy
am
extremely
sorry
the
fogs
prevent
me
from
the
pleasure
of
waiting
on
you
on
board
your
ship
adding
that
six
hundred
men
should
be
furnished
from
the
army
and
the
transports
to
man
the
vigilant
which
was
now
the
most
powerful
ship
in
the
squadron
in
short
he
showed
every
disposition
to
meet
warren
halfway
but
the
commodore
was
beginning
to
feel
some
doubts
as
to
the
expediency
of
the
bold
action
he
had
proposed
and
informed
pepperrell
that
his
pilots
thought
it
impossible
to
go
into
the
harbor
until
the
island
battery
was
silenced
in
fact
there
was
danger
that
if
the
ships
got
in
while
that
battery
was
still
alive
and
active
they
would
never
get
out
again
but
be
kept
there
as
in
a
trap
under
the
fire
from
the
town
ramparts
gridley
s
artillery
at
lighthouse
point
had
been
doing
its
best
dropping
bombshells
with
such
precision
into
the
island
battery
that
the
french
soldiers
were
sometimes
seen
running
into
the
sea
to
escape
the
explosions
many
of
the
island
guns
were
dismounted
and
the
place
was
fast
becoming
untenable
at
the
same
time
the
english
batteries
on
the
land
side
were
pushing
their
work
of
destruction
with
relentless
industry
and
walls
and
bastions
crumbled
under
their
fire
the
french
labored
with
energy
under
cover
of
night
to
repair
the
mischief
closed
the
shattered
west
gate
with
a
wall
of
stone
and
earth
twenty
feet
thick
made
an
epaulement
to
protect
what
was
left
of
the
formidable
circular
battery
all
but
three
of
whose
sixteen
guns
had
been
dismounted
stopped
the
throat
of
the
dauphin
s
bastion
with
a
barricade
of
stone
and
built
a
cavalier
or
raised
battery
on
the
king
s
bastion
where
however
the
english
fire
soon
ruined
it
against
that
near
and
peculiarly
dangerous
neighbor
the
advanced
battery
or
as
they
called
it
the
de
they
planted
three
heavy
cannon
to
take
it
in
flank
these
says
duchambon
produced
a
marvellous
effect
dismounted
one
of
the
cannon
of
the
bastonnais
and
damaged
all
their
embrasures
which
concludes
the
governor
did
not
prevent
them
from
keeping
up
a
constant
fire
and
they
repaired
by
night
the
mischief
we
did
them
by
pepperrell
and
warren
at
length
came
to
an
understanding
as
to
a
joint
attack
by
land
and
water
the
island
battery
was
by
this
time
crippled
and
the
town
batteries
that
commanded
the
interior
of
the
harbor
were
nearly
destroyed
it
was
agreed
that
warren
whose
squadron
was
now
increased
by
recent
arrivals
to
eleven
ships
besides
the
provincial
cruisers
should
enter
the
harbor
with
the
first
fair
wind
cannonade
the
town
and
attack
it
in
boats
while
pepperrell
stormed
it
from
the
land
side
warren
was
to
hoist
a
dutch
flag
under
his
pennant
at
his
as
a
signal
that
he
was
about
to
sail
in
and
pepperrell
was
to
answer
by
three
columns
of
smoke
marching
at
the
same
time
towards
the
walls
with
drums
beating
and
colors
flying
the
french
saw
with
dismay
a
large
quantity
of
fascines
carried
to
the
foot
of
the
glacis
ready
to
fill
the
ditch
and
their
scouts
came
in
with
reports
that
more
than
a
thousand
were
lying
behind
the
ridge
of
the
nearest
hill
toil
loss
of
sleep
and
the
stifling
air
of
the
casemates
in
which
they
were
forced
to
take
refuge

could

borne
all
this
writes

the

the

of

the
absence
of
any
news
from

who
had
been
ordered
to
join

with
his
canadians
and

spread
terror
among
troops
and

the
townspeople
said
that
they
did
not
want
to
be
put
to
the
sword
and
were
not
strong
enough
to
resist
a
general
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
they
brought
a
petition
to
duchambon
begging
him
to
capitulate
on
that
day
captain
sherburn
at
the
advanced
battery
wrote
in
his

we
had
got
all
our

dined
gunners
quartered
matches
lighted
to
return
their
last
favours
when
we
heard
their
drums
beat
a
parley
and
soon
appeared
a
flag
of
truce
which
i

midway
between
our
battery
and
their
walls
conducted
the
officer
to
green

and
delivered
him
to
colonel

richmond
la
perelle
the
french
officer
delivered
a
note
from
duchambon
directed
to
both
pepperrell
and
warren
and
asking
for
a
suspension
of
arms
to
enable
him
to
draw
up
proposals
for
capitulation
warren
chanced
to
be
on
shore
when
the
note
came
and
the
two
commanders
answered
jointly
that
it
had
come
in
good
time
as
they
had
just
resolved
on
a
general
attack
and
that
they
would
give
the
governor
till
eight
o
clock
of
the
next
morning
to
make
his
proposals
they
came
in
due
time
but
were
of
such
a
nature
that
pepperrell
refused
to
listen
to
them
and
sent
back
bonaventure
the
officer
who
brought
them
with
these
were
the
terms
which
duchambon
had
rejected
on
the
seventh
of
may
with
added
conditions
as
among
others
that
no
officer
soldier
or
inhabitant
of
louisbourg
should
bear
arms
against
the
king
of
england
or
any
of
his
allies
for
the
space
of
a
year
duchambon
stipulated
as
the
condition
of
his
acceptance
that
his
troops
should
march
out
of
the
fortress
with
their
arms
and
colors
to
this
both
the
english
commanders
consented
warren
observing
to
pepperrell
the
uncertainty
of
our
affairs
that
depend
so
much
on
wind
and
weather
makes
it
necessary
not
to
stickle
at
the
articles
were
signed
on
both
sides
and
on
the
seventeenth
the
ships
sailed
peacefully
into
the
harbor
while
pepperrell
with
a
part
of
his
ragged
army
entered
the
south
gate
of
the
town
never
was
a
place
more
mal
d
mauled
with
cannon
and
shells
he
writes
to
shirley
neither
have
i
red
in
history
of
any
troops
behaving
with
greater
courage
we
gave
them
about
nine
thousand
and
six
hundred
thus
this
unique
military
performance
ended
in
complete
and
astonishing
success
according
to
english
accounts
the
french
had
lost
about
three
hundred
men
during
the
siege
but
their
real
loss
seems
to
have
been
not
much
above
a
third
of
that
number
on
the
side
of
the
besiegers
the
deaths
from
all
causes
were
only
a
hundred
and
thirty
about
thirty
of
which
were
from
disease
the
french
used
their
muskets
to
good
purpose
but
their
mortar
practice
was
bad
and
close
as
was
the
advanced
battery
to
their
walls
they
often
failed
to
hit
it
while
the
ground
on
both
sides
of
it
looked
like
a
ploughed
field
from
the
bursting
of
their
shells
their
surrender
was
largely
determined
by
want
of
ammunition
as
according
to
one
account
the
french
had
but
barrels
of
gunpowder
left
in
which
particular
the
besiegers
fared
little
better
the
new
england
men
had
been
full
of
confidence
in
the
result
of
the
proposed
assault
and
a
french
writer
says
that
the
timely
capitulation
saved
louisbourg
from
a
terrible
catastrophe
yet
and
disorderly
as
the
besiegers
were
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
quiet
ending
of
the
siege
was
not
as
fortunate
for
them
as
for
their
foes
the
discouragement
of
the
french
was
increased
by
greatly
exaggerated
ideas
of
the
force
of
the
the
de
places
the
alone
at
eight
or
nine
thousand
men
and
duchambon
reports
to
the
minister
d
argenson
that
he
was
attacked
in
all
by
thirteen
thousand
his
mortifying
position
was
a
sharp
temptation
to
exaggerate
but
his
conduct
can
only
be
explained
by
a
belief
that
the
force
of
his
enemy
was
far
greater
than
it
was
in
fact
warren
thought
that
the
proposed
assault
would
succeed
and
wrote
to
pepperrell
that
he
hoped
they
would
soon
keep
a
good
house
together
and
give
the
ladys
of
louisbourg
a
gallant
during
his
visit
to
the
camp
on
the
day
when
the
flag
of
truce
came
out
he
made
a
speech
to
the
new
england
soldiers
exhorting
them
to
behave
like
true
englishmen
at
which
they
cheered
lustily
making
a
visit
to
the
grand
battery
on
the
same
day
he
won
high
favor
with
the
regiment
stationed
there
by
the
gift
of
a
hogshead
of
rum
to
drink
his
health
whether
warren
s
gallant
ball
ever
took
place
in
louisbourg
does
not
clearly
appear
pepperrell
on
his
part
celebrated
the
victory
by
a
dinner
to
the
commodore
and
his
officers
as
the
redoubtable
parson
moody
was
the
general
s
chaplain
and
the
oldest
man
in
the
army
he
expected
to
ask
a
blessing
at
the
board
and
was
in
fact
invited
to
do
so
to
the
great
concern
of
those
who
knew
his
habitual
prolixity
and
dreaded
its
effect
on
the
guests
at
the
same
time
not
one
of
them
dared
rasp
his
irritable
temper
by
any
suggestion
of
brevity
and
hence
they
came
in
terror
to
the
feast
expecting
an
invocation
of
a
good
ended
by
open
revolt
of
the
hungry
britons
when
to
their
surprise
and
relief
moody
said
good
lord
we
have
so
much
to
thank
thee
for
that
time
will
be
too
short
and
we
must
leave
it
for
eternity
bless
our
food
and
fellowship
upon
this
joyful
occasion
for
the
sake
of
christ
our
lord
and
with
that
he
sat
down
it
is
said
that
he
had
been
seen
in
the
french
church
hewing
at
the
altar
and
images
with
the
axe
that
he
had
brought
for
that
purpose
and
perhaps
this
iconoclastic
performance
had
eased
the
high
pressure
of
his
zeal
amazing
as
their
triumph
was
pepperrell
s
soldiers
were
not
satisfied
with
the
capitulation
and
one
of
them
utters
his
disapproval
in
his
diary
thus
sabbath
day
ye
th
june
they
came
to
termes
for
us
to
enter
ye
sitty
to
morrow
and
poore
termes
they
bee
the
occasion
of
discontent
was
the
security
of
property
assured
to
the
inhabitants
by
which
means
says
that
dull
chronicler
niles
the
poor
soldiers
lost
all
their
hopes
and
just
demerit
desert
of
plunder
promised
in
the
meagreness
of
their
pay
they
thought
themselves
entitled
to
the
plunder
of
louisbourg
which
they
imagined
to
be
a
seat
of
wealth
and
luxury
nathaniel
sparhawk
pepperrell
s
thrifty
shared
this
illusion
and
begged
the
general
to
get
for
him
at
a
low
price
a
handsome
service
of
silver
plate
when
the
volunteers
exchanged
their
wet
and
dreary
camp
for
what
they
expected
to
be
the
comfortable
quarters
of
the
town
they
were
disgusted
to
see
the
houses
still
occupied
by
the
owners
and
to
find
themselves
forced
to
stand
guard
at
the
doors
to
protect

writes
one
of
the
disgusted
victors
they
were
not
and
perhaps
could
not
be
long
kept
in
order
and
when
in
accordance
with
the
capitulation
the
inhabitants
had
been
sent
on
board
vessels
for
transportation
to
france
discipline
gave
way
and
general
wolcott
records
that
while
moody
was
preaching
on
a
sunday
in
the
there
was
excessive
stealing
in
every
part
of
the
little
however
was
left
to
steal
but
if
the
army
found
but
meagre
gleanings
the
navy
reaped
a
rich
harvest
french
ships
instead
of
being
barred
out
of
the
harbor
were
now
lured
to
enter
it
the
french
flag
was
kept
flying
over
the
town
and
in
this
way
prizes
were
entrapped
to
the
estimated
value
of
a
million
sterling
half
of
which
went
to
the
crown
and
the
rest
to
the
british
officers
and
crews
the
army
getting
no
share
whatever
now
rose
the
vexed
question
of
the
relative
part
borne
by
the
colonies
and
the
crown
the
army
and
the
navy
in
the
capture
of
louisbourg
and
here
it
may
be
well
to
observe
the
impressions
of
a
french
witness
of
the
siege
it
was
an
enterprise
less
of
the
english
nation
and
its
king
than
of
the
inhabitants
of
new
england
alone
this
singular
people
have
their
own
laws
and
administration
and
their
governor
plays
the
sovereign
admiral
commodore
warren
had
no
authority
over
the
troops
sent
by
the
governor
of
boston
and
he
was
only
a
spectator
nobody
would
have
said
that
their
sea
and
land
forces
were
of
the
same
nation
and
under
the
same
prince
no
nation
but
the
english
is
capable
of
such
eccentricities
which
nevertheless
are
a
part
of
the
precious
liberty
of
which
they
show
themselves
so
the
french
writer
is
correct
when
he
says
that
the
land
and
sea
forces
were
under
separate
commands
and
it
is
equally
true
that
but
for
the
conciliating
temper
of
pepperrell
harmony
could
not
have
been
preserved
between
the
two
chiefs
but
when
he
calls
warren
a
mere
spectator
he
does
glaring
injustice
to
that
gallant
officer
whose
activity
and
that
of
his
captains
was
incessant
and
whose
services
were
invaluable
they
maintained
with
slight
lapses
an
almost
impossible
blockade
without
which
the
siege
must
have
failed
two
or
three
small
vessels
got
into
the
harbor
but
the
capture
of
the
vigilant
more
than
any
other
event
of
the
siege
discouraged
the
french
and
prepared
them
for
surrender
several
english
writers
speak
of
warren
and
the
navy
as
the
captors
of
louisbourg
and
all
new
england
writers
give
the
chief
honor
to
pepperrell
and
the
army
neither
army
nor
navy
would
have
been
successful
without
the
other
warren
and
his
officers
in
a
council
of
war
had
determined
that
so
long
as
the
island
battery
and
the
water
batteries
of
the
town
remained
in
an
efficient
state
the
ships
could
not
enter
the
harbor
and
warren
had
personally
expressed
the
same
opinion
he
did
not
mean
to
enter
till
all
the
batteries
which
had
made
the
attempt
impracticable
including
the
circular
battery
which
was
the
most
formidable
of
all
had
been
silenced
or
crippled
by
the
army
and
by
the
army
alone
the
whole
work
of
the
siege
fell
upon
the
land
forces
and
though
it
had
been
proposed
to
send
a
body
of
marines
on
shore
this
was
not
done
three
or
four
gunners
to
put
your
men
in
the
way
of
loading
cannon
was
warren
s
contribution
to
the
operations
of
the
siege
though
the
fear
of
attack
by
the
ships
jointly
with
the
land
force
no
doubt
hastened
the
surrender
beauharnois
governor
of
canada
ascribes
the
defeat
to
the
extreme
activity
with
which
the
new
england
men
pushed
their
attacks
the
de
says
that
each
of
the
two
commanders
was
eager
that
the
keys
of
the
fortress
should
be
delivered
to
him
and
not
to
his
colleague
that
before
the
surrender
warren
sent
an
officer
to
persuade
the
french
that
it
would
be
for
their
advantage
to
make
their
submission
to
him
rather
than
to
pepperrell
and
that
it
was
in
fact
so
made
wolcott
on
the
other
hand
with
the
best
means
of
learning
the
truth
says
in
his
diary
that
pepperrell
received
the
keys
at
the
south
gate
the
report
that
it
was
the
british
commodore
and
not
their
own
general
to
whom
louisbourg
surrendered
made
a
prodigious
stir
among
the
inhabitants
of
new
england
who
had
the
touchiness
common
to
small
and
ambitious
peoples
and
as
they
had
begun
the
enterprise
and
borne
most
of
its
burdens
and
dangers
they
thought
themselves
entitled
to
the
chief
credit
of
it
pepperrell
was
blamed
as
lukewarm
for
the
honor
of
his
country
because
he
did
not
demand
the
keys
and
reject
the
capitulation
if
they
were
refused
after
all
this
ebullition
it
appeared
that
the
keys
were
in
his
hands
for
when
soon
after
the
siege
shirley
came
to
louisbourg
pepperrell
formally
presented
them
to
him
in
presence
of
the
soldiers
warren
no
doubt
thought
that
he
had
a
right
to
precedence
as
being
an
officer
of
the
king
in
regular
standing
while
pepperrell
was
but
a
civilian
clothed
with
temporary
rank
by
the
appointment
of
a
provincial
governor
warren
was
an
impetuous
sailor
accustomed
to
command
and
pepperrell
was
a
merchant
accustomed
to
manage
and
persuade
the
difference
appears
in
their
correspondence
during
the
siege
warren
is
sometimes
brusque
and
almost
peremptory
pepperrell
is
forbearing
and
considerate
to
the
last
degree
he
liked
warren
and
to
the
last
continued
to
praise
him
highly
in
letters
to
shirley
and
other
provincial
governors
while
warren
on
occasion
of
shirley
s
arrival
at
louisbourg
made
a

complimentary

the

there
is

so
there
will

may
the
list
of
a
company
of
subscribers
to
go
voluntarily
upon
an
attack
against
the
island
battery
is
preserved
it
includes
a
negro
called
the

chosen
by
the

was
daniel
bacon
the
fact
that
neither
this

nor
that

the

commander
is
to
be
found
in
the
list
of
commissioned

of

see
parsons
of

suggests
the
conclusion
that
the
subscribers
were
permitted
to
choose
officers
from
their
own
ranks

accounts
of
this

have
hitherto
rested
with
but
slight
exceptions
on
english
sources
alone
the
archives

have
furnished
useful
material
to
the

narrative
notably
the
long
report
of
the
governor
duchambon
to
the

of

and
the
letter
of
the
intendant
bigot
to
the
same
personage
within
about
six
weeks
after
the
surrender
but
the
most
curious
french
evidence
respecting
the
siege
is
the

this
little
work
of
printed
pages
is
extremely
rare
i
could
study
it
only
by
having
transcript
made
from
the

in
the

as
it
was
not
in
the
british

it

the
imprint
of

is
certainly
a
mask
the
book
having
no
doubt
been
printed
in
france
it
severely
criticises
duchambon
and
makes
him
mainly
answerable

the
troops
and

of
louisbourg
were
all
embarked
for
france
and
the
town
was
at
last
in
full
possession
of
the
victors
the
among
them
and
there
were
few
who
did
not
bear
the
stamp
of
hereditary
puritanism
now
saw
a
fresh
proof
that
they
were
the
peculiar
care
of
an
approving
providence
while
they
were
in
camp
the
weather
had
been
favorable
but
they
were
scarcely
housed
when
a
cold
persistent
rain
poured
down
in
floods
that
would
have
drenched
their
flimsy
tents
and
turned
their
huts
of
turf
into
robbing
the
sick
of
every
hope
of
recovery
even
now
they
got
little
comfort
from
the
shattered
tenements
of
louisbourg
the
siege
had
left
the
town
in
so
filthy
a
condition
that
the
wells
were
infected
and
the
water
was
poisoned
the
soldiers
clamored
for
discharge
having
enlisted
to
serve
only
till
the
end
of
the
expedition
and
shirley
insisted
that
faith
must
be
kept
with
them
or
no
more
would
enlist
pepperrell
much
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
warren
sent
home
about
seven
hundred
men
some
of
whom
were
on
the
sick
list
while
the
rest
had
families
in
distress
and
danger
on
the
exposed
frontier
at
the
same
time
he
begged
hard
for
reinforcements
expecting
a
visit
from
the
french
and
a
desperate
attempt
to
recover
louisbourg
he
and
warren
governed
the
place
jointly
under
martial
law
and
they
both
passed
half
their
time
in
holding
for
disorder
reigned
among
the
disgusted
militia
and
no
less
among
the
crowd
of
hungry
speculators
who
flocked
like
vultures
to
the
conquered
town
to
buy
the
cargoes
of
captured
ships
or
seek
for
other
prey
the
massachusetts
soldiers
whose
pay
was
the
smallest
and
who
had
counted
on
being
at
their
homes
by
the
end
of
july
were
the
most
turbulent
but
all
alike
were
on
the
brink
of
mutiny
excited
by
their
ringleaders
they
one
day
marched
in
a
body
to
the
parade
and
threw
down
their
arms
but
probably
soon
picked
them
up
again
as
in
most
cases
the
guns
were
belonging
to
those
who
carried
them
pepperrell
begged
shirley
to
come
to
louisbourg
and
bring
the
mutineers
back
to
duty
accordingly
on
the
sixteenth
of
august
he
arrived
in
a
accompanied
by
shirley
and
warren
wife
of
the
commodore
the
soldiers
duly
fell
into
line
to
receive
him
as
it
was
not
his
habit
to
hide
his
own
merits
he
tells
the
duke
of
newcastle
that
nobody
but
he
could
have
quieted
the
malcontents
which
is
probably
true
as
nobody
else
had
power
to
raise
their
pay
he
made
them
a
speech
promised
them
forty
shillings
in
massachusetts
currency
a
month
instead
of
and
ended
with
ordering
for
each
man
half
a
pint
of
rum
to
drink
the
king
s
health
though
potations
so
generous
might
be
thought
to
promise
effects
not
wholly
sedative
the
mutineers
were
brought
to
reason
and
some
even
consented
to
remain
in
garrison
till
the
next
june
small
reinforcements
came
from
new
england
to
hold
the
place
till
the
arrival
of
troops
from
gibraltar
promised
by
the
ministry
the
two
regiments
raised
in
the
colonies
and
commanded
by
shirley
and
pepperrell
were
also
intended
to
form
a
part
of
the
garrison
but
difficulty
was
found
in
filling
the
ranks
because
says
shirley
some
commissions
have
been
given
to
englishmen
and
men
will
not
enlist
here
except
under
american
officers
nothing
could
be
more
dismal
than
the
condition
of
louisbourg
as
reflected
in
the
diaries
of
soldiers
and
others
who
spent
there
the
winter
that
followed
its
capture
among
these
diaries
is
that
of
the
worthy
benjamin
crafts
private
in
hale
s
essex
regiment
who
to
the
entry
of
each
day
adds
a
pious
invocation
sincere
in
its
way
no
doubt
though
hackneyed
and
sometimes
in
strange
company
thus
after
noting
down
shirley
s
gift
of
half
a
pint
of
rum
to
every
man
to
drink
the
king
s
health
he
adds
immediately
the
lord
look
upon
us
and
enable
us
to
trust
in
him
may
he
prepare
us

his
holy

the

comforted

in

a
son
of
rev
john
williams
captured
by
the
indians
at
deerfield
in
and
was
now
minister
of
long
meadow
massachusetts
he
had
joined
the
crusade
as
one
of
its
chaplains
and
passed
for
a
man
of
ability
a
point
on
which
those
who
read
his
diary
will
probably
have
doubts
the
lot
of
the
army
chaplains
was
of
the
hardest
a
pestilence
had
fallen
upon
louisbourg
and
turned
the
fortress
into
a
hospital
after
we
got
into
the
town
says
the
sarcastic
douglas
whose
pleasure
it
is
to
put
everything
in
its
worst
light
a
sordid
indolence
or
sloth
for
want
of
discipline
induced
putrid
fevers
and
dysenteries
which
at
length
in
august
became
contagious
and
the
people
died
like
rotten
from
fourteen
to
were
buried
every
day
in
the
cemetery
behind
the
town
outside
the
maurepas
gate
by
the
old
on
rochefort
point
and
the
forgotten
bones
of
above
five
hundred
new
england
men
lie
there
to
this
day
under
the
coarse
neglected
grass
the
chaplain

diary
is
little
but
a
dismal
record
of
sickness
death
sermons
funerals

there

no

great

when
he
sets
down
the
say
of

briton
apparently
a
naval
officer
that
he
had

williams
was
sorely
smitten
with
homesickness
but
he
sturdily
kept
his
post
in
spite
of
grievous
yearnings
for
family
and
flock
the
pestilence
slowly
abated
till
at
length
the
that
passed
the
maurepas
gate
counted
only
three
or
four
a
day
at
the
end
of
january
five
hundred
and
men
had
died
eleven
hundred
were
on
the
sick
list
and
about
one
thousand
fit
for
duty
the
promised
regiments
from
gibraltar
had
not
come
could
the
french
have
struck
then
louisbourg
might
have
changed
hands
again
the
gibraltar
regiments
had
arrived
so
late
upon
that
rude
coast
that
they
turned
southward
to
the
milder
shores
of
virginia
spent
the
winter
there
and
did
not
appear
at
louisbourg
till
april
they
brought
with
them
a
commission
for
warren
as
governor
of
the
fortress
he
made
a
speech
of
thanks
to
the
new
england
garrison
now
reduced
to
less
than
nineteen
hundred
men
sick
and
well
and
they
sailed
at
last
for
home
louisbourg
being
now
thought
safe
from
any
attempt
of
france
to
the
zealous
and
energetic
shirley
the
capture
of
the
fortress
was
but
a
beginning
of
greater
triumphs
scarcely
had
the
new
england
militia
sailed
from
boston
on
their
desperate
venture
when
he
wrote
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
that
should
the
expedition
succeed
all
new
england
would
be
on
fire
to
attack
canada
and
the
other
colonies
would
take
part
with
them
if
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
ministry
and
some
months
later
after
louisbourg
was
taken
he
urged
the
policy
of
striking
while
the
iron
was
hot
and
invading
canada
at
once
the
colonists
he
said
were
ready
and
it
would
be
easier
to
raise
ten
thousand
men
for
such
an
attack
than
one
thousand
to
lie
idle
in
garrison
at
louisbourg
or
anywhere
else
france
and
england
he
thinks
can
not
live
on
the
same
continent
if
we
were
rid
of
the
french
he
continues
england
would
soon
control
america
which
would
make
her
first
among
the
nations
and
he
ventures
what
now
seems
the
modest
prediction
that
in
one
or
two
centuries
the
british

would
rival
france
in

now
he
is
sure
that
they
would
raise
twenty
thousand
men
to
capture
canada
if
the
king
required
it
of
them
and
warren
would
be
an
acceptable
commander
for
the
naval
part
of
the
expedition

concludes
the
governor
i
will
take
no
step
without
orders
from
his
the
duke
of
newcastle
was
now
at
the
head
of
the
government
smollett
and
horace
walpole
have
made
his
absurdities
familiar
in
anecdotes
which
true
or
not
do
no
injustice
to
his
character
yet
he
had
talents
that
were
great
in
their
way
though
their
way
was
a
mean
one
they
were
talents
not
of
the
statesman
but
of
the
political
manager
and
their
object
was
to
win
office
and
keep
it
newcastle
whatever
his
motives
listened
to
the
counsels
of
shirley
and
directed
him
to
consult
with
warren
as
to
the
proposed
attack
on
canada
at
the
same
time
he
sent
a
circular
letter
to
the
governors
of
the
provinces
from
new
england
to
north
carolina
directing
them
should
the
invasion
be
ordered
to
call
upon
their
assemblies
for
as
many
men
as
they
would
grant
shirley
s
views
were
cordially
supported
by
warren
and
the
levies
were
made
accordingly
though
not
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the
several
colonies
for
those
south
of
new
york
felt
little
interest
in
the
plan
shirley
was
told
to
dispose
massachusetts
to
do
its
part
but
neither
he
nor
his
province
needed
prompting
taking
his
cue
from
the
roman
senator
he
exclaimed
to
his
assembly
est
and
the
assembly
responded
by
voting
to
raise
hundred
men
and
offering
a
bounty
equivalent
to
sterling
to
each
volunteer
besides
a
blanket
for
every
one
and
a

the
pennsylvania
assembly
controlled
by

noncombatants
would
give
no
soldiers
but
by
a
popular
movement
the
province
furnished
four
hundred
men
without
the
help
of
its
representatives
as
usual
in
the
english
attempts
against
canada
the
campaign
was
to
be
a
double
one
the
main
body
of
troops
composed
of
british
regulars
and
new
england
militia
was
to
sail
up
the
lawrence
and
attack
quebec
while
the
levies
of
new
york
and
the
provinces
farther
south
aided
it
was
hoped
by
the
warriors
of
the
iroquois
were
to
advance
on
montreal
by
way
of
lake
champlain
newcastle
promised
eight
battalions
of
british
troops
under
they
were
to
meet
the
new
england
men
at
louisbourg
and
all
were
then
to
sail
together
for
quebec
under
the
escort
of
a
squadron
commanded
by
warren
shirley
also
was
to
go
to
louisbourg
and
arrange
the
plan
of
the
campaign
with
the
general
and
the
admiral
thus
without
loss
of
time
the
captured
fortress
was
to
be
made
a
base
of
operations
against
its
late
owners
canada
was
wild
with
alarm
at
reports
of
english
preparation
there
were
about
fifty
english
prisoners
in
barracks
at
quebec
and
every
device
was
tried
to
get
information
from
them
but
being
chiefly
rustics
caught
on
the
frontiers
by
indian
they
had
little
news
to
give
and
often
refused
to
give
even
this
one
of
them
who
had
been
taken
long
before
and
gained
over
by
the
french
was
used
as
an
agent
to
extract
information
from
his
countrymen
and
was
called
homme
de
at
the
same
time
the
prisoners
were
freely
supplied
with
writing
materials
and
their
letters
to
their
friends
being
then
opened
it
appeared
that
they
were
all
in
expectation
of
speedy
deliverance
in
july
a
report
came
from
acadia
that
from
forty
to
fifty
thousand
men
were
to
attack
canada
and
on
the
first
of
august
a
prisoner
lately
taken
at
saratoga
declared
that
there
were
at
boston
ready
to
sail
against
quebec
and
that
thirteen
thousand
men
were
to
march
at
once
from
albany
against
montreal
if
all
these
stories
are
true
writes
the
canadian
journalist
all
the
english
on
this
continent
must
be
in
preparations
for
defence
were
pushed
with
feverish
energy
fireships
were
made
ready
at
quebec
and
at
provisions
were
gathered
and
ammunition
was
distributed
reconnoitring
parties
were
sent
to
watch
the
gulf
and
the
river
and
bands
of
canadians
and
indians
lately
sent
to
acadia
were
ordered
to
hasten
back
thanks
to
the
duke
of
newcastle
all
these
alarms
were
needless
the
massachusetts
levies
were
ready
within
six
weeks
and
shirley
eager
and
impatient
waited
in
vain
for
the
squadron
from
england
and
the
promised
eight
battalions
of
regulars
they
did
not
come
and
in
august
he
wrote
to
newcastle
that
it
would
now
be
impossible
to
reach
quebec
before
october
which
would
be
too
late
the
eight
battalions
had
been
sent
to
portsmouth
for
embarkation
ordered
on
board
the
transports
then
ordered
ashore
again
and
finally
sent
on
an
abortive
expedition
against
the
coast
of
france
there
were
those
who
thought
that
this
had
been
their
destination
from
the
first
and
that
the
proposed
attack
on
canada
was
only
a
pretence
to
deceive
the
enemy
it
was
not
till
the
next
spring
that
newcastle
tried
to
explain
the
miscarriage
to
shirley
he
wrote
that
the
troops
had
been
detained
by
till
general
and
admiral
lestock
thought
it
too
late
to
which
he
added
that
the
demands
of
the
european
war
made
the
canadian
expedition
impracticable
and
that
shirley
was
to
stand
on
the
defensive
and
attempt
no
further
conquests
as
for
the
provincial
soldiers
who
this
time
were
in
the
pay
of
the
crown
he
says
that
they
were
very
expensive
and
orders
the
governor
to
get
rid
of
them
as
cheap
as
thus
not
for
the
first
time
the
hopes
of
the
colonies
were
brought
to
nought
by
the
failure
of
the
british
ministers
to
keep
their
promises
when
in
the
autumn
of
shirley
said
that
for
the
present
canada
was
to
be
let
alone
he
bethought
him
of
a
less
decisive
conquest
and
proposed
to
employ
the
provincial
troops
for
an
attack
on
crown
point
which
formed
a
halfway
station
between
albany
and
montreal
and
was
the
constant
rendezvous
of
against
new
york
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
whose
discords
and
jealousies
had
prevented
them
from
combining
to
attack
it
the
dutch
of
albany
too
had
strong
commercial
reasons
for
not
coming
to
blows
with
the
canadians
of
late
however
massachusetts
and
new
york
had
suffered
so
much
from
this
inconvenient
neighbor
that
it
was
possible
to
unite
them
against
it
and
as
clinton
governor
of
new
york
was
scarcely
less
earnest
to
get
possession
of
crown
point
than
was
shirley
himself
a
plan
of
operations
was
soon
settled
by
the
middle
of
october
fifteen
hundred
massachusetts
troops
were
on
their
way
to
join
the
new
york
levies
and
then
advance
upon
the
obnoxious
post
even
this
modest
enterprise
was
destined
to
fail
astounding
tidings
reached
new
england
and
startled
her
like
a
from
dreams
of
conquest
it
was
reported
that
a
great
french
fleet
and
army
were
on
their
way
to
retake
louisbourg
reconquer
acadia
burn
boston
and
lay
waste
the
other
seaboard
towns
the
massachusetts
troops
marching
for
crown
point
were
recalled
and
the
country
militia
were
mustered
in
arms
in
a
few
days
the
narrow
crooked
streets
of
the
puritan
capital
were
crowded
with
more
than
eight
thousand
armed
rustics
from
the
farms
and
villages
of
middlesex
essex
norfolk
and
worcester
and
connecticut
promised
six
thousand
more
as
soon
as
the
hostile
fleet
should
appear
the
defences
of
castle
william
were
enlarged
and
strengthened
and
cannon
were
planted
on
the
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbor
hulks
were
sunk
in
the
channel
and
a
boom
was
laid
across
it
under
the
guns
of
the
castle
the
alarm
was
compared
to
that
which
filled
england
on
the
approach
of
the
spanish
armada
canada
heard
the
news
of
the
coming
armament
with
an
exultation
that
was
dashed
with
misgiving
as
weeks
and
months
passed
and
the
fleet
did
not
appear
at
length
in
september
a
vessel
put
in
to
an
acadian
harbor
with
the
report
that
she
had
met
the
ships
in
and
that
they
counted
a
hundred
and
fifty
sail
some
weeks
later
the
governor
and
intendant
of
canada
wrote
that
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
they
received
a
letter
from
chibucto
with
the
agreeable
news
that
the
duc
d
anville
and
his
fleet
had
arrived
there
about
three
weeks
before
had
they
known
more
they
would
have
rejoiced
less
that
her
great
american
fortress
should
have
been
snatched
from
her
by
a
despised
militia
was
more
than
france
could
bear
and
in
the
midst
of
a
burdensome
war
she
made
a
crowning
effort
to
retrieve
her
honor
and
pay
the
debt
with
usury
it
was
computed
that
nearly
half
the
french
navy
was
gathered
at
brest
under
command
of
the
duc
d
anville
by
one
account
his
force
consisted
of
eleven
twenty
frigates
and
transports
and
fireships
or
in
all
another
list
gives
a
total
of
of
which
ten
were
were
frigates
and
fireships
and
were
transports
these
last
carried
the
regiment
of
ponthieu
with
other
veteran
troops
to
the
number
in
all
of
three
thousand
one
hundred
and
fifty
the
fleet
was
to
be
joined
at
chibucto
now
halifax
by
four
heavy
lately
sent
to
the
west
indies
under
de
conflans
from
brest
d
anville
sailed
for
some
reason
to
rochelle
and
here
the
ships
were
kept
so
long
by
that
it
was
the
twentieth
of
june
before
they
could
put
to
sea
from
the
first
the
omens
were
sinister
the
admiral
was
beset
with
questions
as
to
the
destination
of
the
fleet
which
was
known
to
him
alone
and
when
for
the
sake
of
peace
he
told
it
to
his
officers
their
discontent
redoubled
the
bay
of
biscay
was
rough
and
boisterous
and
spars
sails
and
bowsprits
were
carried
away
after
they
had
been
a
week
at
sea
some
of
the
ships
being
dull
sailers
lagged
behind
and
the
rest
were
forced
to
shorten
sail
and
wait
for
them
in
the
longitude
of
the
azores
there
was
a
dead
calm
and
the
whole
fleet
lay
idle
for
days
then
came
a
squall
with
lightning
several
ships
were
struck
on
one
of
them
six
men
were
killed
and
on
the
ship
mars
a
box
of
musket
and
cannon
cartridges
blew
up
killed
ten
men
and
wounded
a
which
proved
to
be
sinking
was
abandoned
and
burned
then
a
pestilence
broke
out
and
in
some
of
the
ships
there
were
more
sick
than
in
health
on
the
fourteenth
of
september
they
neared
the
coast
of
nova
scotia
and
were
in
dread
of
the
dangerous
shoals
of
sable
island
the
position
of
which
they
did
not
exactly
know
they
groped
their
way
in
fogs
till
a
fearful
storm
with
thunder
and
lightning
fell
upon
them
the
journalist
of
the
voyage
a
captain
in
the
regiment
of
ponthieu
says
with
the
exaggeration
common
in
such
cases
that
the
waves
ran
as
high
as
the
masts
and
such
was
their
violence
that
a
transport
dashing
against
the
ship
amazone
immediately
went
down
with
all
on
board
the
crew
of
the
prince
d
orange
half
blinded
by
wind
and
spray
saw
the
great
ship
caribou
without
bowsprit
or
driving
towards
them
before
the
gale
and
held
their
breath
in
expectation
of
the
shock
as
she
swept
close
alongside
and
vanished
in
the
storm
the
tempest
raged
all
night
and
the
fleet
became
so
scattered
that
there
was
no
more
danger
of
collision
in
the
morning
the
journalist
could
see
but
five
sail
but
as
the
day
advanced
the
rest
began
to
reappear
and
at
three
o
clock
he
counted
from
the
deck
of
the
prince
d
the
gale
was
subsiding
but
its
effects
were
seen
in
hencoops
casks
and
chests
floating
on
the
surges
and
telling
the
fate
of
one
or
more
of
the
fleet
the
argonaut
was
rolling
helpless
without
masts
or
rudder
the
caribou
had
thrown
overboard
all
the
starboard
guns
of
her
upper
deck
and
the
s
ship
the
trident
was
in
scarcely
better
condition
on
the
they
were
wrapped
in
thick
fog
and
lay
firing
guns
ringing
bells
and
beating
drums
to
prevent
collisions
when
the
weather
cleared
they
looked
in
vain
for
the
admiral
s
ship
the
she
was
not
lost
however
but
with
two
other
ships
was
far
ahead
of
the
fleet
and
near
chibucto
though
in
great
perplexity
having
no
pilot
who
knew
the
coast
she
soon
after
had
the
good
fortune
to
capture
a
small
english
vessel
with
a
man
on
board
well
acquainted
with
chibucto
harbor
d
anville
offered
him
his
liberty
and
a
hundred
louis
if
he
would
pilot
the
ship
in
to
this
he
agreed
but
when
he
rejoined
his
they
called
him
a
traitor
to
his
country
on
which
he
retracted
his
promise
d
anville
was
sorely
perplexed
but
duperrier
captain
of
the
northumberland
less
considerate
of
the
prisoner
s
feelings
told
him
that
unless
he
kept
his
word
he
should
be
thrown
into
the
sea
with
a
pair
of
made
fast
to
his
feet
at
this
his
scruples
gave
way
and
before
night
the
northumberland
was
safe
in
chibucto
bay
d
anville
had
hoped
to
find
here
the
four
ships
of
conflans
which
were
to
have
met
him
from
the
west
indies
at
this
the
appointed
rendezvous
but
he
saw
only
a
solitary
transport
of
his
own
fleet
hills
covered
with
forests
stood
lonely
and
savage
round
what
is
now
the
harbor
of
halifax
conflans
and
his
four
ships
had
arrived
early
in
the
month
and
finding
nobody
though
it
was
nearly
three
months
since
d
anville
left
rochelle
he
cruised
among
the
fogs
for
a
while
and
then
sailed
for
france
a
few
days
before
the
admiral
s
arrival
d
anville
was
ignorant
of
the
fate
of
his
fleet
but
he
knew
that
the
two
ships
which
had
reached
chibucto
with
him
were
full
of
sick
men
that
their
provisions
were
nearly
spent
and
that
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
such
of
the
fleet
as
the
storm
might
have
spared
to
be
in
no
better
case
an
officer
of
the
expedition
describes
d
anville
as
a
man
made
to
command
and
worthy
to
be
loved
and
says
that
he
had
borne
the
disasters
of
the
voyage
with
the
utmost
fortitude
and
serenity
yet
suspense
and
distress
wrought
fatally
upon
him
and
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
of
the
he
died
of
apoplexy
by
the
best
accounts
though
it
was
whispered
among
the
crews
that
he
had
ended
his
troubles
by
poison
at
six
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
d
estournel
the
with
such
ships
as
remained
with
him
entered
the
harbor
and
learned
what
had
happened
he
saw
with
dismay
that
he
was
doomed
to
bear
the
burden
of
command
over
a
ruined
enterprise
and
a
shattered
fleet
the
long
voyage
had
consumed
the
provisions
and
in
some
of
the
ships
the
crews
were
starving
the
pestilence
grew
worse
and
men
were
dying
in
numbers
every
day
on
the
d
anville
was
buried
without
ceremony
on
a
small
island
in
the
harbor
the
officers
met
in
council
and
the
papers
of
the
dead
commander
were
examined
among
them
was
a
letter
from
the
king
in
which
he
urged
the
recapture
of
louisbourg
as
the
first
object
of
the
expedition
but
this
was
thought
impracticable
and
the
council
resolved
to
turn
against
annapolis
all
the
force
that
was
left
it
is
said
that
d
estournel
opposed
the
attempt
insisting
that
it
was
hopeless
and
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
return
to
france
the
debate
was
long
and
hot
and
the
decision
was
against
him
the
council
dissolved
and
he
was
seen
to
enter
his
cabin
in
evident
distress
and
agitation
an
unusual
sound
was
presently
heard
followed
by
groans
his
door
was
fastened
by
two
bolts
put
on
the
evening
before
by
his
order
it
was
burst
open
and
the
unfortunate
commander
was
found
lying
in
a
pool
of
blood
transfixed
with
his
own
sword
enraged
and
mortified
he
had
thrown
himself
upon
it
in
a
fit
of
desperation
the
surgeon
drew
out
the
blade
but
it
was
only
on
the
urgent
persuasion
of
two
jesuits
that
the
dying
man
would
permit
the
wound
to
be
dressed
he
then
ordered
all
the
captains
to
the
side
of
his
berth
and
said
gentlemen
i
beg
pardon
of
god
and
the
king
for
what
i
have
done
and
i
protest
to
the
king
that
my
only
object
was
to
prevent
my
enemies
from
saying
that
i
had
not
executed
his
orders
and
he
named
de
la
jonquière
to
command
in
his
place
in
fact
la
jonquière
s
rank
entitled
him
to
do
so
he
was
afterwards
well
known
as
governor
of
canada
and
was
reputed
a
brave
and
able
la
jonquière
remained
at
chibucto
till
late
in
october
messengers
were
sent
to
the
acadian
settlements
to
ask
for
provisions
of
which
there
was
desperate
need
and
as
payment
was
promised
in
good
metal
and
not
in
paper
the
acadians
brought
in
a
considerable
supply
the
men
were
encamped
on
shore
yet
the
pestilence
continued
its
ravages
two
english
prisoners
were
told
that
between
and
hundred
men
had
been
buried
by
sea
or
land
since
the
fleet
left
france
and
another
declares
that
eleven
hundred
and
burials
took
place
while
he
was
at
chibucto
the
survivors
used
the
clothing
of
the
dead
as
gifts
to
the
neighboring
indians
who
in
consequence
were
attacked
with
such
virulence
by
the
disease
that
of
the
band
at
cape
sable
three
fourths
are
said
to
have
perished
the
english
meanwhile
learned
something
of
the
condition
of
their
enemies
towards
the
end
of
september
captain
sylvanus
cobb
in
a
sloop
from
boston
boldly
entered
chibucto
harbor
took
note
of
the
ships
lying
there
and
though
pursued
ran
out
to
sea
and
carried
the
results
of
his
observations
to
louisbourg
a
more
thorough
reconnoissance
was
afterwards
made
by
a
vessel
from
louisbourg
bringing
french
prisoners
for
exchange
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
it
soon
became
evident
that
the
british
colonies
had
now
nothing
to
fear
la
jonquière
still
clung
to
the
hope
of
a
successful
stroke
at
annapolis
till
in
october
an
acadian
brought
him
the
report
that
the
garrison
of
that
place
had
received
a
reinforcement
of
twelve
hundred
men
the
reinforcement
consisted
in
reality
of
three
small
companies
of
militia
sent
from
boston
by
shirley
la
jonquière
called
a
secret
council
and
the
result
seems
to
have
been
adverse
to
any
further
attempt
the
journalist
reports
that
only
a
thousand
men
were
left
in
fighting
condition
and
that
even
of
these
some
were
dying
every
day
la
jonquière
however
would
not
yet
despair
the
troops
were
five
hospital
ships
were
devoted
to
the
sick
the
parfait
a
ship
no
longer
serviceable
was
burned
as
were
several
smaller
vessels
and
on
the
fourth
of
october
what
was
left
of
the
fleet
sailed
out
of
chibucto
harbor
and
steered
for
annapolis
piloted
by
acadians
the
flag
of
truce
from
louisbourg
was
compelled
for
a
time
to
bear
them
company
and
joseph
foster
of
beverly
an
exchanged
prisoner
on
board
of
her
deposed
that
as
the
fleet
held
its
way
he
saw
a
great
number
of
dead
persons
dropped
into
the
sea
every
day
still
pursued
the
french
a
storm
off
cape
sable
dispersed
the
ships
two
of
which
some
days
later
made
their
way
to
annapolis
basin
in
expectation
of
finding
some
of
their
companions
there
they
found
instead
the
british
ship
chester
and
the
massachusetts
frigate
shirley
anchored
before
the
fort
on
which
the
two
frenchmen
retired
as
they
had
come
and
so
ended
the
last
aggressive
movement
on
the
part
of
the
great
armament
the
journalist
reports
that
on
the
night
of
the
there
was
a
council
of
officers
on
board
the
northumberland
at
which
it
was
resolved
that
no
choice
was
left
but
to
return
to
france
with
the
ships
that
still
kept
together
on
the
fourth
of
november
there
was
another
storm
and
when
it
subsided
the
prince
d
orange
found
herself
with
but
nine
companions
all
of
which
were
transports
these
had
on
board
eleven
companies
of
soldiers
of
whom
their
senior
officer
reports
that
only
were
in
health
the
pestilence
made
such
ravages
among
the
crews
that
four
or
five
corpses
were
thrown
into
the
sea
every
day
and
there
was
fear
that
the
vessels
would
be
left
helpless
in
for
want
of
sailors
to
work
them
at
last
on
the
seventh
of
december
after
narrowly
escaping
an
english
squadron
they
reached
port
louis
in
brittany
where
several
ships
of
the
fleet
had
arrived
before
them
among
these
was
the
frigate
la
yesterday
says
the
journalist
i
supped
with
destrahoudal
who
commands
this
frigate
and
he
told
me
things
which
from
anybody
else
would
have
been
incredible
this
is
his
story
exactly
as
i
had
it
from
and
he
goes
on
to
the
following
effect
after
the
storm
of
the
fourteenth
of
september
provisions
being
almost
spent
it
was
thought
that
there
was
no
hope
for
la
palme
and
her
crew
but
in
giving
up
the
enterprise
and
making
all
sail
at
once
for
home
since
france
now
had
no
port
of
refuge
on
the
western
continent
nearer
than
quebec
rations
were
reduced
to
three
ounces
of
biscuit
and
three
of
salt
meat
a
day
and
after
a
time
half
of
this
pittance
was
cut
off
there
was
diligent
hunting
for
rats
in
the
hold
and
when
this
game
failed
the
crew
crazed
with
famine
demanded
of
their
captain
that
five
english
prisoners
who
were
on
board
should
be
butchered
to
appease
the
frenzy
of
their
hunger
the
captain
consulted
his
officers
and
they
were
of
opinion
that
if
he
did
not
give
his
consent
the
crew
would
work
their
will
without
it
the
ship
s
butcher
was
accordingly
ordered
to
bind
one
of
the
prisoners
carry
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
hold
put
him
to
death
and
distribute
his
flesh
to
the
men
in
portions
of
three
ounces
each
the
captain
walking
the
deck
in
great
agitation
all
night
found
a
pretext
for
deferring
the
deed
till
morning
when
a
watchman
sent
aloft
at
daylight
cried
a
sail
the
providential
stranger
was
a
portuguese
ship
and
as
portugal
was
neutral
in
the
war
she
let
the
frigate
approach
to
within
hailing
distance
the
portuguese
captain
soon
came
alongside
in
a
boat
accompanied
in
the
words
of
the
narrator
by
five
these
were
eagerly
welcomed
by
the
starving
crew
as
agreeable
substitutes
for
the
five
englishmen
and
being
forthwith
slaughtered
were
parcelled
out
among
the
men
who
would
not
wait
till
the
flesh
was
cooked
but
devoured
it
raw
provisions
enough
were
obtained
from
the
portuguese
to
keep
the
frigate
s
company
alive
till
they
reached
port
louis
there
are
no
sufficient
means
of
judging
how
far
the
disasters
of
d
anville
s
fleet
were
due
to
a
neglect
of
sanitary
precautions
or
to
deficient
seamanship
certain
it
is
that
there
were
many
in
new
england
who
would
have
held
it
impious
to
doubt
that
god
had
summoned
the
pestilence
and
the
storm
to
fight
the
battles
of
his
modern
israel
undaunted
by
disastrous
failure
the
french
court
equipped
another
fleet
not
equal
to
that
of
d

yet
still
formidable
and
placed
it
under

constantly
in

as
an
object
of
prime

the
recovery
of
her
lost
colony
of

this
was
one
of
the
chief
aims
of
d
anville
s
expedition
and
of
that
of

in
the
next
year
and
to
make
assurance
still
more
sure
a
large
body
of
canadians
under
de
ramesay
had
been
sent
to
acadia
to
with
d
anville
s
force
but
the
greater
part
of
them
had
been
recalled
to
aid
in
defending
quebec
against
the
expected
attack
of
the
english
they
returned
when
the
news
came
that
d
anville
was
at
chibucto
and
ramesay
with
a
part
of
his
command
advanced
upon
port
royal
or
annapolis
in
order
to
support
the
fleet
in
its
promised
attack
on
that
place
he
encamped
at
a
little
distance
from
the
english
fort
till
he
heard
of
the
disasters
that
had
ruined
the
fleet
and
then
fell
back
to
chignecto
on
the
neck
of
the
acadian
peninsula
where
he
made
his
quarters
with
a
force
which
including
micmac
malicite
and
penobscot
indians
amounted
at
one
time
to
about
sixteen
hundred
men
if
france
was
bent
on
recovering
acadia
shirley
was
no
less
resolved
to
keep
it
if
he
could
in
his
belief
it
was
the
key
of
the
british
american
colonies
and
again
and
again
he
urged
the
duke
of
newcastle
to
protect
it
but
newcastle
seems
scarcely
to
have
known
where
acadia
was
being
ignorant
of
most
things
except
the
art
of
managing
the
house
of
commons
and
careless
of
all
things
that
could
not
help
his
party
and
himself
hence
shirley
s
hyperboles
though
never
without
a
basis
of
truth
were
lost
upon
him
once
it
is
true
he
sent
three
hundred
men
to
annapolis
but
one
hundred
and
eighty
of
them
died
on
the
voyage
or
lay
helpless
in
boston
hospitals
and
the
rest
could
better
have
been
spared
some
being
recruits
from
english
jails
and
others
irish
catholics
several
of
whom
deserted
to
the
french
with
information
of
the
state
of
the
garrison
the
defence
of
acadia
was
left
to
shirley
and
his
assembly
who
in
time
of
need
sent
companies
of
militia
and
rangers
to
annapolis
and
thus
on
several
occasions
saved
it
from
returning
to
france
shirley
was
the
most
watchful
and
strenuous
defender
of
british
interests
on
the
continent
and
in
the
present
crisis
british
and
colonial
interests
were
one
he
held
that
if
acadia
were
lost
the
peace
and
safety
of
all
the
other
colonies
would
be
in
peril
and
in
spite
of
the
immense
efforts
made
by
the
french
court
to
recover
it
he
felt
that
the
chief
danger
of
the
province
was
not
from
without
but
from
within
if
a
thousand
french
troops
should
land
in
nova
scotia
he
writes
to
newcastle
all
the
people
would
rise
to
join
them
besides
all
the
so
too
thought
the
french
officials
in
america
the
governor
and
intendant
of
canada
wrote
to
the
colonial
minister
the
inhabitants
with
few
exceptions
wish
to
return
under
the
french
dominion
and
will
not
hesitate
to
take
up
arms
as
soon
as
they
see
themselves
free
to
do
so
that
is
as
soon
as
we
become
masters
of
port
royal
or
they
have
powder
and
other
munitions
of
war
and
are
backed
by
troops
for
their
protection
against
the
resentment
of
the
up
to
this
time
however
though
they
had
aided
duvivier
in
his
attack
on
annapolis
so
far
as
was
possible
without
seeming
to
do
so
they
had
not
openly
taken
arms
and
their
refusal
to
fight
for
the
besiegers
is
one
among
several
causes
to
which
mascarene
ascribes
the
success
of
his
defence
while
the
greater
part
remained
attached
to
france
some
leaned
to
the
english
who
bought
their
produce
and
paid
them
in
ready
coin
money
was
rare
with
the
acadians
who
loved
it
and
were
so
addicted
to
hoarding
it
that
the
french
authorities
were
led
to
speculate
as
to
what
might
be
the
object
of
these
careful
savings
though
the
acadians
loved
france
they
were
not
always
ready
to
sacrifice
their
interests
to
her
they
would
not
supply
ramesay
s
force
with
provisions
in
exchange
for
his
promissory
notes
but
demanded
hard
cash
this
he
had
not
to
give
and
was
near
being
compelled
to
abandon
his
position
in
consequence
at
the
same
time
in
consideration
of
specie
payment
the
inhabitants
brought
in
fuel
for
the
english
garrison
at
louisbourg
and
worked
at
repairing
the
rotten
de
of
annapolis
mascarene
commandant
at
that
place
being
of
french
descent
was
disposed
at
first
to
sympathize
with
the
acadians
and
treat
them
with
a
lenity
that
to
the
members
of
his
council
seemed
neither
fitting
nor
prudent
he
wrote
to
shirley
the
french
inhabitants
are
certainly
in
a
very
perilous
situation
those
who
pretend
to
be
their
friends
and
old
masters
having
let
loose
a
parcel
of
banditti
to
plunder
them
whilst
on
the
other
hand
they
see
themselves
threatened
with
ruin
if
they
fail
in
their
allegiance
to
the
british
this
unhappy
people
were
in
fact
between
two
fires
france
claimed
them
on
one
side
and
england
on
the
other
and
each
demanded
their
adhesion
without
regard
to
their
feelings
or
their
welfare
the
banditti
of
whom
mascarene
speaks
were
the
micmac
indians
who
were
completely
under
the
control
of
their
missionary
le
loutre
and
were
used
by
him
to
terrify
the
inhabitants
into
renouncing
their
english
allegiance
and
actively
supporting
the
french
cause
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
france
had
transferred
acadia
to
great
britain
and
the
inhabitants
had
afterwards
taken
an
oath
of
fidelity
to
king
george
thus
they
were
british
subjects
but
as
their
oath
had
been
accompanied
by
a
promise
or
at
least
a
clear
understanding
that
they
should
not
be
required
to
take
arms
against
frenchmen
or
indians
they
had
become
known
as
the
neutral
this
name
tended
to
perplex
them
and
in
their
ignorance
and
simplicity
they
hardly
knew
to
which
side
they
owed
allegiance
their
illiteracy
was
extreme
few
of
them
could
sign
their
names
and
a
contemporary
well
acquainted
with
them
declares
that
he
knew
but
a
single
acadian
who
could
read
and
write
this
was
probably
the
notary
le
blanc
whose
compositions
are
crude
and
illiterate
ignorant
of
books
and
isolated
in
a
wild
and
remote
corner
of
the
world
the
acadians
knew
nothing
of
affairs
and
were
totally
incompetent
to
meet
the
crisis
that
was
soon
to
come
upon
them
in
activity
and
enterprise
they
were
far
behind
the
canadians
who
looked
on
them
as
inferiors
their
pleasures
were
those
of
the
humblest
and
simplest
peasants
they
were
contented
with
their
lot
and
asked
only
to
be
let
alone
their
intercourse
was
unceremonious
to
such
a
point
that
they
never
addressed
each
other
or
it
is
said
even
strangers
as
they
had
the
social
equality
which
can
exist
only
in
the
humblest
conditions
of
society
and
presented
the
phenomenon
of
a
primitive
little
democracy
hatched
under
the
wing
of
an
absolute
monarchy
each
was
as
good
as
his
neighbor
they
had
no
natural
leaders
nor
any
to
advise
or
guide
them
except
the
missionary
priest
who
in
every
case
was
expected
by
his
superiors
to
influence
them
in
the
interest
of
france
and
who
in
fact
constantly
did
so
while
one
observer
represents
them
as
living
in
a
state
of
primeval
innocence
another
describes
both
men
and
women
as
extremely
foul
of
speech
from
which
he
draws
inferences
unfavorable
to
their
domestic
morals
which
nevertheless
were
commendable
as
is
usual
with
a
and
unambitious
peasantry
they
were
very
prolific
and
are
said
to
have
doubled
their
number
every
sixteen
years
in
they
counted
in
the
peninsula
of
nova
scotia
between
twelve
and
thirteen
thousand
souls
the
english
rule
had
been
of
the
lightest
so
light
that
it
could
scarcely
be
felt
and
this
was
not
surprising
since
the
only
instruments
for
enforcing
it
over
a
population
wholly
french
were
some
two
hundred
disorderly
soldiers
in
the
crumbling
little
fort
of
annapolis
and
the
province
was
left
perforce
to
take
care
of
itself
the
appearance
of
d
anville
s
fleet
caused
great
excitement
among
the
acadians
who
thought
that
they
were
about
to
pass
again
under
the
crown
of
france
fifty
of
them
went
on
board
the
french
ships
at
chibucto
to
pilot
them
to
the
attack
of
annapolis
and
to
their
dismay
found
that
no
attack
was
to
be
made
when
ramesay
with
his
canadians
and
indians
took
post
at
chignecto
and
built
a
fort
at
baye
verte
on
the
neck
of
the
peninsula
of
nova
scotia
the
english
power
in
that
part
of
the
colony
seemed
at
an
end
the
inhabitants
cut
off
all
communication
with
annapolis
and
detained
the
officers
whom
mascarene
sent
for
intelligence
from
the
first
outbreak
of
the
war
it
was
evident
that
the
french
built
their
hopes
of
recovering
acadia
largely
on
a
rising
of
the
acadians
against
the
english
rule
and
that
they
spared
no
efforts
to
excite
such
a
rising
early
in
a
violent
and
cruel
precaution
against
this
danger
was
suggested
william
shirreff
provincial
secretary
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
acadians
ought
to
be
removed
being
a
standing
menace
to
the
colony
this
is
the
first
proposal
of
such
a
nature
that
i
find
some
months
later
shirley
writes
that
on
a
false
report
of
the
capture
of
annapolis
by
the
french
the
acadians
sang
and
that
every
sign
indicates
that
there
will
be
an
attempt
in
the
spring
to
capture
annapolis
with
their
help
again
shirley
informs
newcastle
that
the
french
will
get
possession
of
acadia
unless
the
most
dangerous
of
the
inhabitants
are
removed
and
english
settlers
put
in
their
place
he
adds
that
there
are
not
two
hundred
and
twenty
soldiers
at
annapolis
to
defend
the
province
against
the
whole
body
of
acadians
and
indians
and
he
tells
the
minister
that
unless
the
expedition
against
canada
should
end
in
the
conquest
of
that
country
the
removal
of
some
of
the
acadians
will
be
a
necessity
he
means
those
of
chignecto
who
were
kept
in
a
threatening
attitude
by
the
presence
of
ramesay
and
his
canadians
and
who
as
he
thinks
had
forfeited
their
lands
by
treasonable
conduct
shirley
believes
that
families
from
new
england
might
be
induced
to
take
their
place
and
that
these
if
settled
under
suitable
regulations
would
form
a
military
frontier
to
the
province
of
nova
scotia
strong
enough
to
keep
the
canadians
out
and
hold
the
acadians
to
their
allegiance
the
duke
of
bedford
thinks
the
plan
a
good
one
but
objects
to
the
expense
commodore
knowles
then
governor
of
louisbourg
who
being
threatened
with
consumption
and
convinced
that
the
climate
was
killing
him
vented
his
feelings
in
strictures
against
everything
and
everybody
was
of
opinion
that
the
acadians
having
broken
their
neutrality
ought
to
be
expelled
at
once
and
expresses
the
amiable
hope
that
should
his
majesty
adopt
this
plan
he
will
charge
him
with
executing
it
shirley
s
energetic
nature
inclined
him
to
trenchant
measures
and
he
had
nothing
of
modern
humanitarianism
but
he
was
not
inhuman
and
he
shrank
from
the
cruelty
of
forcing
whole
communities
into
exile
while
knowles
and
others
called
for
wholesale
expatriation
he
still
held
that
it
was
possible
to
turn
the
greater
part
of
the
acadians
into
safe
subjects
of
the
british
crown
and
to
this
end
he
advised
the
planting
of
a
fortified
town
where
halifax
now
stands
and
securing
by
forts
and
garrisons
the
neck
of
the
acadian
peninsula
where
the
population
was
most
numerous
and
most
disaffected
the
garrisons
he
thought
would
not
only
impose
respect
but
would
furnish
the
acadians
with
what
they
wanted
most
ready
markets
for
their
produce
and
thus
bind
them
to
the
british
by
strong
ties
of
interest
newcastle
thought
the
plan
good
but
wrote
that
its
execution
must
be
deferred
to
a
future
day
three
years
later
it
was
partly
carried
into
effect
by
the
foundation
of
halifax
but
at
that
time
the
disaffection
of
the
acadians
had
so
increased
and
the
hope
of
regaining
the
province
for
france
had
risen
so
high
that
this
partial
and
tardy
assertion
of
british
authority
only
spurred
the
french
agents
to
redoubled
efforts
to
draw
the
inhabitants
from
the
allegiance
they
had
sworn
to
the
crown
of
england
shirley
had
also
other
plans
in
view
for
turning
the
acadians
into
good
british
subjects
he
proposed
as
a
measure
of
prime
necessity
to
exclude
french
priests
from
the
province
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
had
been
insured
to
the
inhabitants
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
and
on
this
point
the
english
authorities
had
given
no
just
cause
of
complaint
a
priest
had
occasionally
been
warned
suspended
or
removed
but
without
a
single
exception
so
far
as
appears
this
was
in
consequence
of
conduct
which
tended
to
excite
disaffection
and
which
would
have
incurred
equal
or
greater
penalties
in
the
case
of
a
layman
the
sentence
was
directed
not
against
the
priest
but
against
the
political
agitator
shirley
s
plan
of
excluding
french
priests
from
the
province
would
not
have
violated
the
provisions
of
the
treaty
provided
that
the
inhabitants
were
supplied
with
other
priests
not
french
subjects
and
therefore
not
politically
dangerous
but
though
such
a
measure
was
several
times
proposed
by
the
provincial
authorities
the
exasperating
apathy
of
the
newcastle
government
gave
no
hope
that
it
could
be
accomplished
the
influences
most
dangerous
to
british
rule
did
not
proceed
from
love
of
france
or
sympathy
of
race
but
from
the
power
of
religion
over
a
simple
and
ignorant
people
trained
in
profound
love
and
awe
of
their
church
and
its
ministers
who
were
used
by
the
representatives
of
louis
xv
as
agents
to
alienate
the
acadians
from
england
the
most
strenuous
of
these
clerical
agitators
was
abbé
le
loutre
missionary
to
the
micmacs
and
after
of
acadia
he
was
a
fiery
and
enterprising
zealot
inclined
by
temperament
to
methods
of
violence
detesting
the
english
and
restrained
neither
by
pity
nor
scruple
from
using
threats
of
damnation
and
the
micmac
tomahawk
to
frighten
the
acadians
into
doing
his
bidding
the
worst
charge
against
him
that
of
exciting
the
indians
of
his
mission
to
murder
captain
howe
an
english
officer
has
not
been
proved
but
it
would
not
have
been
brought
against
him
by
his
own
countrymen
if
his
character
and
past
conduct
had
gained
him
their
esteem
the
other
acadian
priests
were
far
from
sharing
le
loutre
s
violence
but
their
influence
was
always
directed
to
alienating
the
inhabitants
from
their
allegiance
to
king
george
hence
shirley
regarded
the
conversion
of
the
acadians
to
protestantism
as
a
political
measure
of
the
first
importance
and
proposed
the
establishment
of
schools
in
the
province
to
that
end
thus
far
his
recommendations
are
perfectly
legitimate
but
when
he
adds
that
rewards
ought
to
be
given
to
acadians
who
renounce
their
faith
few
will
venture
to
defend
him
newcastle
would
trouble
himself
with
none
of
his
schemes
and
acadia
was
left
to
drift
with
the
tide
as
before
i
shall
finish
my
troubleing
your
grace
upon
the
affairs
of
nova
scotia
with
this
letter
writes
the
persevering
shirley
and
he
proceeds
to
ask
as
a
proper
scheme
for
better
securing
the
subjection
of
the
french
inhabitants
and
indians
there
that
the
governor
and
council
at
annapolis
have
special
authority
and
direction
from
the
king
to
arrest
and
examine
such
acadians
as
shall
be
most
obnoxious
and
dangerous
to
his
majesty
s
government
and
if
found
guilty
of
treasonable
correspondence
with
the
enemy
to
dispose
of
them
and
their
estates
in
such
manner
as
his
majesty
shall
order
at
the
same
time
promising
indemnity
to
the
rest
for
past
offences
upon
their
taking
or
renewing
the
oath
of
allegiance
to
this
it
does
not
appear
that
newcastle
made
any
answer
except
to
direct
shirley
eight
or
nine
months
later
to
tell
the
acadians
that
so
long
as
they
were
peaceable
subjects
they
should
be
protected
in
property
and
religion
thus
left
to
struggle
unaided
with
a
most
difficult
problem
entirely
outside
of
his
functions
as
governor
of
massachusetts
shirley
did
what
he
could
the
most
pressing
danger
as
he
thought
rose
from
the
presence
of
ramesay
and
his
canadians
at
chignecto
for
that
officer
spared
no
pains
to
induce
the
acadians
to
join
him
in
another
attempt
against
annapolis
telling
them
that
if
they
did
not
drive
out
the
english
the
english
would
drive
them
out
he
was
now
at
mines
trying
to
raise
the
inhabitants
in
arms
for
france
shirley
thought
it
necessary
to
counteract
him
and
force
him
and
his
canadians
back
to
the
isthmus
whence
they
had
come
but
as
the
ministry
would
give
no
soldiers
he
was
compelled
to
draw
them
from
new
england
the
defence
of
acadia
was
the
business
of
the
home
government
and
not
of
the
colonies
but
as
they
were
deeply
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
endangered
province
massachusetts
gave
five
hundred
men
in
response
to
shirley
s
call
and
rhode
island
and
new
hampshire
added
between
them
as
many
more
less
than
half
of
these
levies
reached
acadia
it
was
the
stormy
season
the
rhode
island
vessels
were
wrecked
near
martha
s
vineyard
a
new
hampshire
transport
sloop
was
intercepted
by
a
french
armed
vessel
and
ran
back
to
portsmouth
four
hundred
and
seventy
men
from
massachusetts
under
colonel
arthur
noble
were
all
who
reached
annapolis
whence
they
sailed
for
mines
accompanied
by
a
few
soldiers
of
the
garrison
storms
drifting
ice
and
the
furious
tides
of
the
bay
of
fundy
made
their
progress
so
difficult
and
uncertain
that
noble
resolved
to
finish
the
journey
by
land
and
on
the
fourth
of
december
he
disembarked
near
the
place
now
called
french
cross
at
the
foot
of
the
north
mountain
a
lofty
barrier
of
rock
and
forest
extending
along
the
southern
shore
of
the
bay
of
fundy
without
a
path
and
without
guides
the
party
climbed
the
heights
and
toiled
towards
their
destination
each
man
carrying
provisions
for
fourteen
days
in
his
haversack
after
sleeping
eight
nights
without
shelter
among
the
snowdrifts
they
reached
the
acadian
village
of
grand
pré
the
chief
settlement
of
the
district
of
mines
ramesay
and
his
canadians
were
gone
on
learning
the
approach
of
an
english
force
he
had
tried
to
persuade
the
acadians
that
they
were
to
be
driven
from
their
homes
and
that
their
only
hope
was
in
joining
with
him
to
meet
force
by
force
but
they
trusted
shirley
s
recent
assurance
of
protection
and
replied
that
they
would
not
break
their
oath
of
fidelity
to
king
george
on
this
ramesay
retreated
to
his
old
station
at
chignecto
and
noble
and
his
men
occupied
grand
pré
without
opposition
the
village
consisted
of
small
low
wooden
houses
scattered
at
intervals
for
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
and
therefore
ill
fitted
for
defence
the
english
had
the
frame
of
a
blockhouse
or
as
some
say
of
two
blockhouses
ready
to
be
set
up
on
their
arrival
but
as
the
ground
was
hard
frozen
it
was
difficult
to
make
a
foundation
and
the
frames
were
therefore
stored
in
outbuildings
of
the
village
with
the
intention
of
raising
them
in
the
spring
the
vessels
which
had
brought
them
together
with
stores
ammunition
five
small
cannon
and
a
good
supply
of
had
just
arrived
at
the
and
here
with
incredible
fatuity
were
allowed
to
remain
with
most
of
their
indispensable
contents
still
on
board
the
men
meanwhile
were
quartered
in
the
acadian
houses
noble
s
position
was
critical
but
he
was
assured
that
he
could
not
be
reached
from
chignecto
in
such
a
bitter
season
and
this
he
was
too
ready
to
believe
though
he
himself
had
just
made
a
march
which
if
not
so
long
was
quite
as
arduous
yet
he
did
not
neglect
every
precaution
but
kept
out
to
range
the
surrounding
country
while
the
rest
of
his
men
took
their
ease
in
the
acadian
houses
living
on
the
provisions
of
the
villagers
for
which
payment
was
afterwards
made
some
of
the
inhabitants
who
had
openly
favored
ramesay
and
his
followers
fled
to
the
woods
in
fear
of
the
consequences
but
the
greater
part
remained
quietly
in
the
village
at
the
head
of
the
bay
of
fundy
its
waters
form
a
fork
consisting
of
chignecto
bay
on
the
one
hand
and
mines
basin
on
the
other
at
the
head
of
chignecto
bay
was
the
acadian
settlement
of
chignecto
or
beaubassin
in
the
houses
of
which
ramesay
had
quartered
his
canadians
here
the
neck
of
the
acadian
peninsula
is
at
its
narrowest
the
distance
across
to
baye
verte
where
ramesay
had
built
a
fort
being
little
more
than
twelve
miles
thus
he
controlled
the
isthmus
from
which
however
noble
hoped
to
dislodge
him
in
the
spring
in
the
afternoon
of
the
eighth
of
january
an
acadian
who
had
been
sent
to
mines
by
the
missionary
germain
came
to
beaubassin
with
the
news
that
two
hundred
and
twenty
english
were
at
grand
pré
and
that
more
were
expected
ramesay
instantly
formed
a
plan
of
extraordinary
hardihood
and
resolved
by
a
rapid
march
and
a
night
attack
to
surprise
the
his
party
was
greatly
reduced
by
disease
and
to
recruit
it
he
wrote
to
la
corne
récollet
missionary
at
miramichi
to
join
him
with
his
indians
writing
at
the
same
time
to
maillard
former
colleague
of
le
loutre
at
the
mission
of
shubenacadie
and
to
girard
priest
of
cobequid
to
muster
indians
collect
provisions

this
was

on

of

he
and
the
other
officers
led
their
men
across
the
isthmus
from
beaubassin
to
baye
verte
where
they
all
encamped
in
the
woods
and
where
they
were
joined
by
a
party
of
indians
and
some
acadians
from
beaubassin
and
isle
st
jean
provisions
ammunition
and
other
requisites
were
distributed
and
at
noon
of
the
they
broke
up
their
camp
marched
three
leagues
and
bivouacked
towards
evening
on
the
next
morning
they
marched
again
at
daybreak
there
was
sharp
cold
with
a
storm
of
snow
not
the
large
moist
lazy
flakes
that
fall
peacefully
and
harmlessly
but
those
small
crystalline
particles
that
drive
spitefully
before
the
wind
and
prick
the
cheek
like
needles
it
was
the
kind
of
called
in
canada
they
had
hoped
to
make
a
long
day
s
march
but
feet
and
faces
were
freezing
and
they
were
forced
to
stop
at
noon
under
such
shelter
as
the
thick
woods
of
pine
spruce
and
fir
could
supply
in
the
morning
they
marched
again
following
the
border
of
the
sea
their
dragging
provisions
and
baggage
over
the
broken
ice
of
creeks
and
inlets
which
they
sometimes
avoided
by
hewing
paths
through
the
forest
after
a
day
of
extreme
fatigue
they
stopped
at
the
small
bay
where
the
town
of
wallace
now
stands
beaujeu
says
while
we
were
digging
out
the
snow
to
make
our
huts
there
came
two
acadians
with
letters
from
mm
maillard
and
the
two
priests
sent
a
mixture
of
good
and
evil
news
on
one
hand
the
english
were
more
numerous
than
had
been
reported
on
the
other
they
had
not
set
up
the
blockhouses
they
had
brought
with
them
some
acadians
of
the
neighboring
settlement
joined
the
party
at
this
camp
as
also
did
a
few
indians
on
the
next
morning
january
the
adventurers
stopped
at
the
village
of
tatmagouche
where
they
were
again
joined
by
a
number
of
acadians
after
mending
their
broken
sledges
they
resumed
their
march
and
at
five
in
the
afternoon
reached
a
place
called
bacouel
at
the
beginning
of
the
portage
that
led
some
miles
across
the
country
to
cobequid
now
truro
at
the
head
of
mines
basin
here
they
were
met
by
girard
priest
of
cobequid
from
whom
coulon
exacted
a
promise
to
meet
him
again
at
that
village
in
two
days
girard
gave
the
promise
unwillingly
fearing
says
beaujeu
to
embroil
himself
with
the
english
authorities
he
reported
that
the
force
at
grand
pré
counted
at
least
four
hundred
and
fifty
or
as
some
said
more
than
five
hundred
this
startling
news
ran
through
the
camp
but
the
men
were
not
daunted
the
more
there
are
they
said
the
more
we
shall
the
party
spent
the
in
mending
their
damaged
sledges
and
in
the
afternoon
they
were
joined
by
more
acadians
and
indians
thus
reinforced
they
marched
again
and
towards
evening
reached
a
village
on
the
outskirts
of
cobequid
here
the
missionary
maillard
joined
them
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
coulon
who
relied
on
him
and
his
brother
priest
girard
to
procure
supplies
of
provisions
maillard
promised
to
go
himself
to
grand
pré
with
the
indians
of
his
mission
the
party
rested
for
a
day
and
set
out
again
on
the
first
of
february
stopped
at
maillard
s
house
in
cobequid
for
the
provisions
he
had
collected
for
them
and
then
pushed
on
towards
the
river
shubenacadie
which
runs
from
the
south
into
cobequid
bay
the
head
of
mines
basin
when
they
reached
the
river
they
found
it
impassable
from
floating
ice
which
forced
them
to
seek
a
passage
at
some
distance
above
coulon
was
resolved
however
that
at
any
risk
a
detachment
should
cross
at
once
to
stop
the
roads
to
grand
pré
and
prevent
the
english
from
being
warned
of
his
approach
for
though
the
acadians
inclined
to
the
french
and
were
eager
to
serve
them
when
the
risk
was
not
too
great
there
were
some
of
them
who
from
interest
or
fear
were
ready
to
make
favor
with
the
english
by
carrying
them
intelligence
boishébert
with
ten
canadians
put
out
from
shore
in
a
canoe
and
were
near
perishing
among
the
drifting
ice
but
they
gained
the
farther
shore
at
last
and
guarded
every
path
to
grand
pré
the
main
body
filed
on
up
the
east
bank
of
the
shubenacadie
where
the
forests
were
choked
with
snow
and
encumbered
with
fallen
trees
over
which
the
sledges
were
to
be
dragged
to
their
great
detriment
on
this
day
the
third
they
made
five
leagues
on
the
next
only
two
which
brought
them
within
half
a
league
of
le
loutre
s
micmac
mission
not
far
from
this
place
the
river
was
easily
passable
on
the
ice
and
they
continued
their
march
westward
across
the
country
to
the
river
kennetcook
by
ways
so
difficult
that
their
indian
guide
lost
the
path
and
for
a
time
led
them
astray
on
the
seventh
boishébert
and
his
party
rejoined
them
and
brought
a
reinforcement
of
sixteen
indians
whom
the
acadians
had
furnished
with
arms
provisions
were
failing
till
on
the
eighth
as
they
approached
the
village
of
pisiquid
now
windsor
the
acadians
with
great
zeal
brought
them
a
supply
they
told
them
too
that
the
english
at
grand
pré
were
perfectly
secure
suspecting
no
danger
on
the
ninth
in
spite
of
a
cold
dry
storm
of
snow
they
reached
the
west
branch
of
the
river
avon
it
was
but
seven
french
leagues
to
grand
pré
which
they
hoped
to
reach
before
night
but
fatigue
compelled
them
to
rest
till
the
tenth
at
noon
of
that
day
the
storm
still
continuing
they
marched
again
though
they
could
hardly
see
their
way
for
the
driving
snow
they
soon
came
to
a
small
stream
along
the
frozen
surface
of
which
they
drew
up
in
order
and
by
command
of
coulon
beaujeu
divided
them
all
into
ten
parties
for
simultaneous
attacks
on
as
many
houses
occupied
by
the
english
then
marching
slowly
lest
they
should
arrive
too
soon
they
reached
the
river
gaspereau
which
enters
mines
basin
at
grand
pré
they
were
now
but
half
a
league
from
their
destination
here
they
stopped
an
hour
in
the
storm
shivering
and
half
frozen
waiting
for
nightfall
when
it
grew
dark
they
moved
again
and
soon
came
to
a
number
of
houses
on
the
each
of
the
ten
parties
took
possession
of
one
of
these
making
great
fires
to
warm
themselves
and
dry
their
guns
it
chanced
that
in
the
house
where
coulon
and
his
band
sought
shelter
a
was
going
on
the
guests
were
much
startled
at
this
sudden
irruption
of
armed
men
but
to
the
canadians
and
their
chief
the
festival
was
a
stroke
of
amazing
good
luck
for
most
of
the
guests
were
inhabitants
of
grand
pré
who
knew
perfectly
the
houses
occupied
by
the
english
and
could
tell
with
precision
where
the
officers
were
quartered
this
was
a
point
of
extreme
importance
the
english
were
distributed
among
houses
scattered
as
before
mentioned
for
the
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
the
assailants
were
too
few
to
attack
all
these
houses
at
once
but
if
those
where
the
chief
officers
lodged
could
be
surprised
and
captured
with
their
inmates
the
rest
could
make
little
resistance
hence
it
was
that
coulon
had
divided
his
followers
into
ten
parties
each
with
one
or
more
chosen
officers
these
officers
were
now
called
together
at
the
house
of
the
interrupted
festivity
and
the
late
guests
having
given
full
information
as
to
the
position
of
the
english
quarters
and
the
military
quality
of
their
inmates
a
special
object
of
attack
was
assigned
to
the
officer
of
each
party
with
acadian
guides
to
conduct
him
to
it
the
principal
party
consisting
of
fifty
or
as
another
account
says
of
men
was
led
by
coulon
himself
with
beaujeu
desligneris
mercier
léry
and
lusignan
as
his
officers
this
party
was
to
attack
a
stone
house
near
the
middle
of
the
village
where
the
main
guard
was
stationed
a
building
somewhat
larger
than
the
rest
and
the
only
one
at
all
suited
for
defence
the
second
party
of
forty
men
commanded
by
la
corne
with
rigauville
lagny
and
villemont
was
to
attack
a
neighboring
house
the
quarters
of
colonel
noble
his
brother
ensign
noble
and
several
other
officers
the
remaining
parties
of
men
each
according
to
beaujeu
or
according
to
la
corne
were
to
make
a
dash
as
nearly
as
possible
at
the
same
time
at
other
houses
which
it
was
thought
most
important
to
secure
all
had
acadian
guides
whose
services
in
that
capacity
were
invaluable
though
beaujeu
complains
that
they
were
of
no
use
in
the
attack
he
says
that
the
united
force
was
about
three
hundred
men
while
the
english
captain
goldthwait
puts
it
including
acadians
and
indians
at
from
five
to
six
hundred
that
of
the
english
was
a
little
above
five
hundred
in
all
every
arrangement
being
made
and
his
part
assigned
to
each
officer
the
whole
body
was
drawn
up
in
the
storm
and
the
chaplain
pronounced
a
general
absolution
then
each
of
the
ten
parties
guided
by
one
or
more
acadians
took
the
path
for
its
destination
every
man
on
with
the
lock
of
his
gun
well
sheltered
under
his
capote
the
largest
party
under
coulon
was
as
we
have
seen
to
attack
the
stone
house
in
the
middle
of
the
village
but
their
guide
went
astray
and
about
three
in
the
morning
they
approached
a
small
wooden
house
not
far
from
their
true
object
a
guard
was
posted
here
as
at
all
the
english
quarters
the
night
was
dark
and
the
snow
was
still
falling
as
it
had
done
without
ceasing
for
the
past
thirty
hours
the
english
sentinel
descried
through
the
darkness
and
the
storm
what
seemed
the
shadows
of
an
advancing
crowd
of
men
he
cried
who
goes
there
and
then
shouted
to
arms
a
door
was
flung
open
and
the
guard
appeared
in
the
entrance
but
at
that
moment
the
moving
shadows
vanished
from
before
the
eyes
of
the
sentinel
the
french
one
and
all
had
thrown
themselves
flat
in
the
soft
light
snow
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
or
heard
the
english
thought
it
a
false
alarm
and
the
house
was
quiet
again
then
coulon
and
his
men
rose
and
dashed
forward
again
in
a
loud
and
startled
voice
the
sentinel
shouted
to
arms
a
great
light
as
of
a
blazing
fire
shone
through
the
open
doorway
and
men
were
seen
within
in
hurried
movement
coulon
who
was
in
the
front
said
to
beaujeu
who
was
close
at
his
side
that
the
house
was
not
the
one
they
were
to
attack
beaujeu
replied
that
it
was
no
time
to
change
and
coulon
dashed
forward
again
beaujeu
aimed
at
the
sentinel
and
shot
him
dead
there
was
the
flash
and
report
of
muskets
from
the
house
and
coulon
dropped
in
the
snow
severely
wounded
the
young
cadet
lusignan
was
hit
in
the
shoulder
but
he
still
pushed
on
when
a
second
shot
shattered
his
thigh
friends
cried
the
gallant
youth
as
he
fell
by
the
side
of
his
commander
don
t
let
two
dead
men
discourage
the
canadians
powdered
from
head
to
foot
with
snow
burst
into
the
house
within
ten
minutes
all
resistance
was
overpowered
of
englishmen
were
killed
and
three
made
prisoners
meanwhile
la
corne
with
his
party
of
forty
men
had
attacked
the
house
where
were
quartered
colonel
noble
and
his
brother
with
captain
howe
and
several
other
officers
noble
had
lately
transferred
the
main
guard
to
the
stone
house
but
had
not
yet
removed
thither
himself
and
the
guard
in
the
house
which
he
occupied
was
small
the
french
burst
the
door
with
axes
and
rushed
in
colonel
noble
startled
from
sleep
sprang
from
his
bed
receiving
two
in
the
body
as
he
did
so
he
seems
to
have
had
pistols
for
he
returned
the
fire
several
times
his
servant
who
was
in
the
house
testified
that
the
french
called
to
the
colonel
through
a
window
and
promised
him
quarter
if
he
would
surrender
but
that
he
refused
on
which
they
fired
again
and
a
bullet
striking
his
forehead
killed
him
instantly
his
brother
ensign
noble
was
also
shot
down
fighting
in
his
shirt
lieutenants
pickering
and
lechmere
lay
in
bed
dangerously
ill
and
were
killed
there
lieutenant
jones
after
as
the
narrator
says
ridding
himself
of
some
of
the
enemy
tried
to
break
through
the
rest
and
escape
but
was
run
through
the
heart
with
a
bayonet
captain
howe
was
severely
wounded
and
made
prisoner
coulon
and
lusignan
disabled
by
their
wounds
were
carried
back
to
the
houses
on
the
gaspereau
where
the
french
surgeon
had
remained
coulon
s
party
now
commanded
by
beaujeu
having
met
and
joined
the
smaller
party
under
lotbinière
proceeded
to
the
aid
of
others
who
might
need
their
help
for
while
they
heard
a
great
noise
of
musketry
from
far
and
near
and
could
discern
bodies
of
men
in
motion
here
and
there
they
could
not
see
whether
these
were
friends
or
foes
or
discern
which
side
fortune
favored
they
presently
met
the
party
of
marin
composed
of
indians
who
had
just
been
repulsed
with
loss
from
the
house
which
they
had
attacked
by
this
time
there
was
a
gleam
of
daylight
and
as
they
plodded
wearily
over
the
snowdrifts
they
no
longer
groped
in
darkness
the
two
parties
of
colombière
and
boishébert
soon
joined
them
with
the
agreeable
news
that
each
had
captured
a
house
and
the
united
force
now
proceeded
to
make
a
successful
attack
on
two
buildings
where
the
english
had
stored
the
frames
of
their
blockhouses
here
the
assailants
captured
ten
prisoners
it
was
now
broad
day
but
they
could
not
see
through
the
falling
snow
whether
the
enterprise
as
a
whole
had
prospered
or
failed
therefore
beaujeu
sent
marin
to
find
la
corne
who
in
the
absence
of
coulon
held
the
chief
command
marin
was
gone
two
hours
at
length
he
returned
and
reported
that
the
english
in
the
houses
which
had
not
been
attacked
together
with
such
others
as
had
not
been
killed
or
captured
had
drawn
together
at
the
stone
house
in
the
middle
of
the
village
that
la
corne
was
blockading
them
there
and
that
he
ordered
beaujeu
and
his
party
to
join
him
at
once
when
beaujeu
reached
the
place
he
found
la
corne
posted
at
the
house
where
noble
had
been
killed
and
which
was
within
easy
of
the
stone
house
occupied
by
the
english
against
whom
a
spattering
fire
was
kept
up
by
the
french
from
the
cover
of
neighboring
buildings
those
in
the
stone
house
returned
the
fire
but
no
great
harm
was
done
on
either
side
till
the
english
now
commanded
by
captain
goldthwait
attempted
to
recapture
the
house
where
la
corne
and
his
party
were
posted
two
companies
made
a
sally
but
they
had
among
them
only
eighteen
pairs
of
the
rest
having
been
left
on
board
the
two
vessels
which
had
brought
the
stores
of
the
detachment
from
annapolis
and
which
now
lay
moored
hard
by
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
at
or
near
the
mouth
of
the
gaspereau
hence
the
sallying
party
floundered
helpless
among
the
drifts
plunging
so
deep
in
the
dry
snow
that
they
could
not
use
their
guns
and
could
scarcely
move
while
bullets
showered
upon
them
from
la
corne
s
men
in
the
house
and
others
hovering
about
them
on
the
attempt
was
hopeless
and
after
some
loss
the
two
companies
fell
back
the
firing
continued
as
before
till
noon
or
according
to
beaujeu
till
three
in
the
afternoon
when
a
french
officer
carrying
a
flag
of
truce
came
out
of
la
corne
s
house
the
occasion
of
the
overture
was
this
captain
howe
who
as
before
mentioned
had
been
badly
wounded
at
the
capture
of
this
house
was
still
there
a
prisoner
without
surgical
aid
the
french
surgeon
being
at
the
houses
on
the
gaspereau
in
charge
of
coulon
and
other
wounded
men
though
says
beaujeu
m
howe
was
a
firm
man
he
begged
the
chevalier
la
corne
not
to
let
him
bleed
to
death
for
want
of
aid
but
permit
him
to
send
for
an
english
to
this
la
corne
after
consulting
with
his
officers
consented
and
marin
went
to
the
english
with
a
white
flag
and
a
note
from
howe
explaining
the
situation
the
surgeon
was
sent
and
howe
s
wound
was
dressed
marin
remaining
as
a
hostage
a
suspension
of
arms
took
place
till
the
surgeon
s
return
after
which
it
was
prolonged
till
nine
o
clock
of
the
next
morning
at
the
instance
according
to
french
accounts
of
the
english
and
according
to
english
accounts
of
the
french
in
either
case
the
truce
was
welcome
to
both
sides
the
english
who
were
in
the
stone
house
to
the
number
of
nearly
three
hundred
and
fifty
crowded
to
suffocation
had
five
small
cannon
two
of
which
were
and
three
were
swivels
but
these
were
probably
not
in
position
as
it
does
not
appear
that
any
use
was
made
of
them
there
was
no
ammunition
except
what
the
men
had
in
their
and
the
main
stock
having
been
left
with
other
necessaries
on
board
the
schooner
and
sloop
now
in
the
hands
of
the
french
it
was
found
on
examination
that
they
had
ammunition
for
eight
shots
each
and
provisions
for
one
day
water
was
only
to
be
had
by
bringing
it
from
a
neighboring
brook
as
there
were
for
only
about
one
man
in
twenty
sorties
were
out
of
the
question
and
the
house
was
commanded
by
high
ground
on
three
sides
though
their
number
was
still
considerable
their
position
was
growing
desperate
thus
it
happened
that
when
the
truce
expired
goldthwait
the
english
commander
with
another
officer
who
seems
to
have
been
captain
preble
came
with
a
white
flag
to
the
house
where
la
corne
was
posted
and
proposed
terms
of
capitulation
howe
who
spoke
french
acting
as
interpreter
la
corne
made
proposals
on
his
side
and
as
neither
party
was
anxious
to
continue
the
fray
they
soon
came
to
an
understanding
it
was
agreed
that
within
hours
the
english
should
march
for
annapolis
with
the
honors
of
war
that
the
prisoners
taken
by
the
french
should
remain
in
their
hands
that
the
indians
who
had
been
the
only
plunderers
should
keep
the
plunder
they
had
taken
that
the
english
sick
and
wounded
should
be
left
till
their
recovery
at
the
neighboring
settlement
of
protected
by
a
french
guard
and
that
the
english
engaged
in
the
affair
at
grand
pré
should
not
bear
arms
during
the
next
six
months
within
the
district
about
the
head
of
the
bay
of
fundy
including
chignecto
grand
pré
and
the
neighboring
settlements
captain
howe
was
released
on
parole
with
the
condition
that
he
should
send
back
in
exchange
one
lacroix
a
french
prisoner
at
boston
which
says
la
corne
he
faithfully
thus
ended
one
of
the
most
gallant
exploits
in
annals
as
respects
the
losses
on
each
side
the
french
and
english
accounts
are
irreconcilable
nor
are
the
statements
of
either
party
consistent
with
themselves
mascarene
reports
to
shirley
that
seventy
english
were
killed
and
above
sixty
captured
though
he
afterwards
reduces
these
numbers
having
as
he
says
received
farther
information
on
the
french
side
he
says
that
four
officers
and
about
forty
men
were
killed
and
that
many
wounded
were
carried
off
in
carts
during
the
fight
beaujeu
on
the
other
hand
sets
the
english
loss
at
one
hundred
and
thirty
killed
fifteen
wounded
and
fifty
captured
and
the
french
loss
at
seven
killed
and
fifteen
wounded
as
for
the
numbers
engaged
the
statements
are
scarcely
less
divergent
it
seems
clear
however
that
when
coulon
began
his
march
from
baye
verte
his
party
consisted
of
about
three
hundred
canadians
and
indians
without
reckoning
some
acadians
who
had
joined
him
from
beaubassin
and
isle
jean
others
joined
him
on
the
way
to
grand
pré
counting
a
hundred
and
fifty
according
to
shirley
which
appears
to
be
much
too
large
an
estimate
the
english
by
their
own
showing
numbered
five
hundred
or
five
hundred
and
of
eleven
houses
attacked
ten
were
surprised
and
carried
with
the
help
of
the
darkness
and
storm
and
the
skilful
management
of
the
assailants
no
sooner
was
the
capitulation
signed
says
beaujeu
than
we
became
in
appearance
the
best
of
la
corne
directed
military
honors
to
be
rendered
to
the
remains
of
the
brothers
noble
and
in
all
points
the
canadians
both
officers
and
men
treated
the
english
with
kindness
and
courtesy
the
english
commandant
again
says
beaujeu
invited
us
all
to
dine
with
him
and
his
officers
so
that
we
might
have
the
pleasure
of
making
acquaintance
over
a
bowl
of
the
repast
being
served
after
such
a
fashion
as
circumstances
permitted
victors
and
vanquished
sat
down
together
when
says
beaujeu
we
received
on
the
part
of
our
hosts
many
compliments
on
our
polite
manners
and
our
skill
in
making
and
the
compliments
were
well
deserved
at
eight
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
of
february
the
english
filed
out
of
the
stone
house
and
with
arms
shouldered
drums
beating
and
colors
flying
marched
between
two
ranks
of
the
french
and
took
the
road
for
annapolis
the
english
sick
and
wounded
were
sent
to
the
settlement
of
where
protected
by
a
french
guard
and
attended
by
an
english
surgeon
they
were
to
remain
till
able
to
reach
the
british
fort
la
corne
called
a
council
of
war
and
in
view
of
the
scarcity
of
food
and
other
reasons
it
was
resolved
to
return
to
beaubassin
many
of
the
french
had
fallen
ill
some
of
the
sick
and
wounded
were
left
at
grand
pré
others
at
cobequid
and
the
acadians
were
required
to
supply
means
of
carrying
the
rest
coulon
s
party
left
grand
pré
on
the
of
february
and
on
the
eighth
of
march
reached
beaubassin
ramesay
did
not
fail
to
use
the
success
at
grand
pré
to
influence
the
minds
of
the
acadians
he
sent
a
circular
letter
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
various
districts
and
especially
to
those
of
mines
in
which
he
told
them
that
their
country
had
been
reconquered
by
the
arms
of
the
king
of
france
to
whom
he
commanded
them
to
be
faithful
subjects
holding
no
intercourse
with
the
english
under
any
pretence
whatever
on
pain
of
the
severest
punishment
if
he
concludes
we
have
withdrawn
our
soldiers
from
among
you
it
is
for
reasons
known
to
us
alone
and
with
a
view
to
your
unfortunately
for
the
effect
of
this
message
shirley
had
no
sooner
heard
of
the
disaster
at
grand
pré
than
he
sent
a
body
of
massachusetts
soldiers
to
reoccupy
the
place
this
they
did
in
april
the
acadians
thus
found
themselves
as
usual
between
two
dangers
and
unable
to
see
which
horn
of
the
dilemma
was
the
worse
they
tried
to
avoid
both
by
conciliating
french
and
english
alike
and
assuring
each
of
their
devoted
attachment
they
sent
a
pathetic
letter
to
ramesay
telling
him
that
their
hearts
were
always
french
and
begging
him
at
the
same
time
to
remember
that
they
were
a
poor
helpless
people
burdened
with
large
families
and
in
danger
of
expulsion
and
ruin
if
they
offended
their
masters
the
english
they
wrote
at
the
same
time
to
mascarene
at
annapolis
sending
him
to
explain
the
situation
a
copy
of
ramesay
s
threatening
letter
to
them
begging
him
to
consider
that
they
could
not
without
danger
dispense
with
answering
it
at
the
same
time
they
protested
their
entire
fidelity
to
king
george
ramesay
not
satisfied
with
the
results
of
his
first
letter
wrote
again
to
the
acadians
ordering
them
in
the
name
of
the
of
new
france
to
take
up
arms
against
the
english
and
enclosing
for
their
instruction
an
extract
from
a
letter
of
the
french
governor
these
says
ramesay
are
his
words
we
consider
ourself
as
master
of
beaubassin
and
mines
since
we
have
driven
off
the
english
therefore
there
is
no
difficulty
in
forcing
the
acadians
to
take
arms
for
us
to
which
end
we
declare
to
them
that
they
are
discharged
from
the
oath
that
they
formerly
took
to
the
english
by
which
they
are
bound
no
longer
as
has
been
decided
by
the
authorities
of
canada
and
monseigneur
our
in
view
of
the
above
continues
ramesay
we
order
all
the
inhabitants
of
memeramcook
to
come
to
this
place
beaubassin
as
soon
as
they
see
the
lighted
or
discover
the
approach
of
the
enemy
and
this
on
pain
of
death
confiscation
of
all
their
goods
burning
of
their
houses
and
the
punishment
due
to
rebels
against
the
the
position
of
the
acadians
was
deplorable
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
france
had
transferred
them
to
the
british
crown
yet
french
officers
denounced
them
as
rebels
and
threatened
them
with
death
if
they
did
not
fight
at
their
bidding
against
england
and
english
officers
threatened
them
with
expulsion
from
the
country
if
they
broke
their
oath
of
allegiance
to
king
george
it
was
the
duty
of
the
british
ministry
to
occupy
the
province
with
a
force
sufficient
to
protect
the
inhabitants
against
french
terrorism
and
leave
no
doubt
that
the
king
of
england
was
master
of
acadia
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
this
alone
could
have
averted
the
danger
of
acadian
revolt
and
the
harsh
measures
to
which
it
afterwards
gave
rise
the
ministry
sent
no
aid
but
left
to
shirley
and
massachusetts
the
task
of
keeping
the
province
for
king
george
shirley
and
massachusetts
did
what
they
could
but
they
could
not
do
all
that
the
emergency
demanded
shirley

spoke
his
mind

the

whose
favor
he
was
dependent

thinks

inexpedient

believes
that

the
best
plan
of
all
in

is
that
of
treating

as
subjects
confining
their
punishment
to
the
most
guilty
and
dangerous
among
em

keeping

passed
for

at
that
day
here
a
vital
question
was
what
would
be
the
attitude
of
the
five
nations
of
the
iroquois
towards
the
rival
european
colonies
their
neighbors
the
treaty
of
utrecht
called
them
british
subjects
what
the
word
subjects
meant
they
themselves
hardly
knew
the
english
told
them
that
it
meant
children
the
french
that
it
meant
dogs
and
slaves
events
had
tamed
the
fierce
confederates
and
now
though
like
all
savages
unstable
as
children
they
leaned
in
their
soberer
moments
to
a
position
of
neutrality
between
their
european
neighbors
watching
with
jealous
eyes
against
the
encroachments
of
both
the
french
would
gladly
have
enlisted
them
and
their
tomahawks
in
the
war
but
seeing
little
hope
of
this
were
generally
content
if
they
could
prevent
them
from
siding
with
the
english
who
on
their
part
regarded
them
as
their
indians
and
were
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
active
alliance
when
shirley
s
plan
for
the
invasion
of
canada
was
afoot
clinton
governor
of
new
york
with
much
ado
succeeded
in
convening
the
deputies
of
the
confederacy
at
albany
and
by
dint
of
speeches
and
presents
induced
them
to
sing
the
and
take
up
the
hatchet
for
england
the
iroquois
were
disgusted
when
the
scheme
came
to
nought
their
warlike
ardor
cooled
and
they
conceived
a
low
opinion
of
english
prowess
the
condition
of
new
york
as
respects
military
efficiency
was
deplorable
she
was
divided
against
herself
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
party
passion
was
stronger
than
the
demands
of
war
the
province
was
in
the
midst
of
one
of
those
disputes
with
the
representative
of
the
crown
which
in
one
degree
or
another
crippled
or
paralyzed
the
military
activity
of
nearly
all
the
british
colonies
twenty
years
or
more
earlier
when
massachusetts
was
at
blows
with
the
indians
on
her
borders
she
suffered
from
the
same
disorders
but
her
governor
and
assembly
were
of
one
mind
as
to
urging
on
the
war
and
quarrelled
only
on
the
questions
in
what
way
and
under
what
command
it
should
be
waged
but
in
new
york
there
was
a
strong
party
that
opposed
the
war
being
interested
in
the
contraband
trade
long
carried
on
with
canada
clinton
the
governor
had
too
an
enemy
in
the
person
of
the
chief
justice
james
de
lancey
with
whom
he
had
had
an
dispute
ending
in
a
threat
on
the
part
of
de
lancey
that
he
would
make
the
governor
s
seat
uncomfortable
to
marked
abilities
better
education
and
more
knowledge
of
the
world
than
was
often
found
in
the
provinces
ready
wit
and
conspicuous
social
position
the
chief
justice
joined
a
restless
ambition
and
the
arts
of
a
demagogue
he
made
good
his
threat
headed
the
opposition
to
the
governor
and
proved
his
most
formidable
antagonist
if
either
clinton
or
shirley
had
had
the
independent
authority
of
a
canadian
governor
the
conduct
of
the
war
would
have
been
widely
different
clinton
was
hampered
at
every
turn
the
assembly
held
him
at
advantage
for
it
was
they
and
not
the
king
who
paid
his
salary
and
they
could
withhold
or
retrench
it
when
he
displeased
them
the
people
sympathized
with
their
representatives
and
backed
them
in
opposition
at
least
when
not
under
the
stress
of
imminent
danger
a
body
of
provincials
in
the
pay
of
the
king
had
been
mustered
at
albany
for
the
proposed
canada
expedition
and
after
that
plan
was
abandoned
clinton
wished
to
use
them
for
protecting
the
northern
frontier
and
capturing
that
standing
menace
to
the
province
crown
point
the
assembly
bent
on
crossing
him
at
any
price
refused
to
provide
for
transporting
supplies
farther
than
albany
as
the
furnishing
of
provisions
and
transportation
depended
on
that
body
they
could
stop
the
movement
of
troops
and
defeat
the
governor
s
military
plans
at
their
pleasure
in
vain
he
told
them
if
you
deny
me
the
necessary
supplies
all
my
endeavors
must
become
fruitless
i
must
wash
my
own
hands
and
leave
at
your
doors
the
blood
of
the
innocent
he
urged
upon
them
the
necessity
of
building
forts
on
the
two
between
the
hudson
and
lakes
george
and
champlain
thus
blocking
the
path
of
from
canada
they
would
do
nothing
insisting
that
the
neighboring
colonies
to
whom
the
forts
would
also
be
useful
ought
to
help
in
building
them
and
when
it
was
found
that
these
colonies
were
ready
to
do
their
part
the
assembly
still
refused
passionate
opposition
to
the
royal
governor
seemed
to
blind
them
to
the
interests
of
the
province
nor
was
the
fault
all
on
their
side
for
the
governor
though
he
generally
showed
more
and
moderation
than
could
have
been
expected
sometimes
lost
temper
and
betrayed
scorn
for
his
opponents
many
of
whom
were
but
the
instruments
of
leaders
urged
by
personal
animosities
and
small
but
intense
ambitions
they
accused
him
of
treating
them
with
contempt
and
of
embezzling
public
money
while
he
retorted
by
charging
them
with
encroaching
on
the
royal
prerogative
and
treating
the
representative
of
the
king
with
indecency
under
such
conditions
an
efficient
conduct
of
the
war
was
out
of
the
question
once
when
the
frontier
was
seriously
threatened
clinton
as
called
out
the
militia
to
defend
it
but
they
refused
to
obey
on
the
ground
that
no
act
of
the
assembly
required
them
to
do
so
clinton
sent
home
bitter
complaints
to
newcastle
and
the
lords
of
trade
they
the
assembly
are
selfish
jealous
of
the
power
of
the
crown
and
of
such
levelling
principles
that
they
are
constantly
attacking
its
prerogative
i
find
that
neither
dissolutions
nor
fair
means
can
produce
from
them
such
effects
as
will
tend
to
a
publick
good
or
their
own
preservation
they
will
neither
act
for
themselves
nor
assist
their
neighbors
few
but
hirelings
have
a
seat
in
the
assembly
who
protract
time
for
the
sake
of
their
wages
at
a
great
expence
to
the
province
without
contributing
anything
material
for
its
welfare
credit
or
and
he
declares
that
unless
parliament
takes
them
in
hand
he
can
do
nothing
for
the
service
of
the
king
or
the
good
of
the
province
for
they
want
to
usurp
the
whole
administration
both
civil
and
military
at
saratoga
there
was
a
small
settlement
of
dutch
farmers
with
a
stockade
fort
for
their
protection
this
was
the
farthest
outpost
of
the
colony
and
the
only
defence
of
albany
in
the
direction
of
canada
it
was
occupied
by
a
sergeant
a
corporal
and
ten
soldiers
who
testified
before
a
court
of
inquiry
that
it
was
in
such
condition
that
in
rainy
weather
neither
they
nor
their
ammunition
could
be
kept
dry
as
neither
the
assembly
nor
the
merchants
of
albany
would
make
it
tenable
the
garrison
was
withdrawn
before
winter
by
order
of
the
governor
scarcely
was
this
done
when
five
hundred
french
and
indians
under
the
partisan
marin
surprised
the
settlement
in
the
night
of
the
of
november
burned
fort
houses
mills
and
stables
killed
thirty
persons
and
carried
off
about
a
hundred
prisoners
albany
was
left
uncovered
and
the
assembly
voted
in
provincial
currency
to
rebuild
the
ruined
fort
a
feeble
palisade
work
was
accordingly
set
up
but
it
was
neglected
like
its
predecessor
colonel
peter
schuyler
was
stationed
there
with
his
regiment
in
but
was
forced
to
abandon
his
post
for
want
of
supplies
clinton
then
directed
colonel
roberts
commanding
at
albany
to
examine
the
fort
and
if
he
found
it
indefensible
to
burn
it
which
he
did
much
to
the
astonishment
of
a
french
who
visited
the
place
soon
after
and
found
nothing
but
ashes
the
burning
of
saratoga
first
by
the
french
and
then
by
its
own
masters
made
a
deep
impression
on
the
five
nations
and
a
few
years
later
they
taunted
their
white
neighbors
with
these
shortcomings
in
no
measured
terms
you
burned
your
own
fort
at
seraghtoga
and
ran
away
from
it
which
was
a
shame
and
a
scandal
to
uninitiated
as
they
were
in
party
politics
and
faction
quarrels
they
could
see
nothing
in
this
and
other
military
lapses
but
proof
of
a
want
of
martial
spirit
if
not
of
cowardice
hence
the
difficulty
of
gaining
their
active
alliance
against
the
french
was
redoubled
fortunately
for
the
province
the
adverse
influence
was
in
some
measure
counteracted
by
the
character
and
conduct
of
one
man
up
to
this
time
the
french
had
far
surpassed
the
rival
nation
in
the
possession
of
men
ready
and
able
to
deal
with
the
indians
and
mould
them
to
their
will
eminent
among
such
was
joncaire
french
emissary
among
the
senecas
in
western
new
york
who
with
admirable
skill
held
back
that
powerful
member
of
the
iroquois
league
from
siding
with
the
english
but
now
among
the
mohawks
of
eastern
new
york
joncaire
found
his
match
in
the
person
of
william
johnson
a
vigorous
and
intelligent
young
irishman
nephew
of
admiral
warren
and
his
agent
in
the
management
of
his
estates
on
the
mohawk
johnson
soon
became
intimate
with
his
indian
neighbors
spoke
their
language
joined
in
their
games
and
dances
sometimes
borrowed
their
dress
and
their
paint
and
whooped
yelped
and
stamped
like
one
of
themselves
a
white
man
thus
playing
the
indian
usually
gains
nothing
in
the
esteem
of
those
he
imitates
but
as
before
in
the
case
of
the
redoubtable
count
frontenac
johnson
s
adoption
of
their
ways
increased
their
liking
for
him
and
did
not
diminish
their
respect
the
mohawks
adopted
him
into
their
tribe
and
made
him
a
warchief
clinton
saw
his
value
and
as
the
albany
commissioners
hitherto
charged
with
indian
affairs
had
proved
wholly
inefficient
he
transferred
their
functions
to
johnson
whence
arose
more
heartburnings
the
favor
of
the
governor
cost
the
new
functionary
the
support
of
the
assembly
who
refused
the
indispensable
presents
to
the
indians
and
thus
vastly
increased
the
difficulty
of
his
task
yet
the
five
nations
promised
to
take
up
the
hatchet
against
the
french
and
their
orator
said
in
a
conference
at
albany
should
any
french
priests
now
dare
to
come
among
us
we
know
no
use
for
them
but
to
roast
johnson
s
present
difficulties
however
sprang
more
from
dutch
and
english
traders
than
from
french
priests
and
he
begs
that
an
act
may
be
passed
against
the
selling
of
liquor
to
the
indians
as
it
is
impossible
to
do
anything
with
them
while
there
is
such
a
plenty
to
be
had
all
round
the
neighborhood
being
forever
and
he
complains
especially
of
one
clement
who
sells
liquor
within
twenty
yards
of
johnson
s
house
and
immediately
gets
from
the
indians
all
the
bounty
money
they
receive
for
scalps
which
leaves
them
as
poor
as
ratts
and
therefore
refractory
and
unmanageable
johnson
says
further
there
is
another
grand
villain
george
clock
who
lives
by
conajoharie
castle
and
robs
the
indians
of
all
their
cloaths
the
chiefs
complained
upon
which
i
wrote
him
twice
to
give
over
that
custom
of
selling
liquor
to
the
indians
the
answer
was
he
gave
the
bearer
i
might
hang
indian
affairs
it
will
be
seen
were
no
better
regulated
then
than
now
meanwhile
the
french
indians
were
ravaging
the
frontiers
and
burning
farmhouses
to
within
sight
of
albany
the
assembly
offered
rewards
for
the
scalps
of
the
marauders
but
were
slow
in
sending
money
to
pay
them
to
the
great
discontent
of
the
mohawks
who
however
at
johnson
s
instigation
sent
out
various
two
of
which
accompanied
by
a
few
whites
made
raids
as
far
as
the
island
of
montreal
and
somewhat
checked
the
incursions
of
the
mission
indians
by
giving
them
work
near
home
the
check
was
but
momentary
heathen
indians
from
the
west
joined
the
canadian
converts
and
the
frontiers
of
new
york
and
new
england
from
the
mohawk
to
beyond
the
kennebec
were
stung
through
all
their
length
by
innumerable
nocturnal
surprises
and
petty
attacks
the
details
of
this
murderous
though
ineffective
partisan
war
would
fill
volumes
if
they
were
worth
recording
one
or
two
examples
will
show
the
nature
of
all
in
the
valley
of
the
little
river
ashuelot
a
new
hampshire
affluent
of
the
connecticut
was
a
rude
which
later
years
transformed
into
a
town
noted
in
rural
new
england
for
kindly
hospitality
culture
without
pretence
and
without
conventionality
in
the
place
was
in
all
the
rawness
and
ugliness
of
a
backwoods
hamlet
the
rough
fields
lately
won
from
the
virgin
forest
showed
here
and
there
among
the
stumps
a
few
roofed
with
slabs
of
pine
spruce
or
hemlock
near
by
was
a
wooden
fort
made
no
doubt
after
the
common
frontier
pattern
of
a
stockade
fence
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
enclosing
cabins
to
shelter
the
settlers
in
case
of
alarm
and
furnished
at
the
corners
with
what
were
called
flankers
which
were
boxes
of
thick
plank
large
enough
to
hold
two
or
more
men
raised
above
the
ground
on
posts
and
pierced
with
loopholes
so
that
each
face
of
the
stockade
could
be
swept
by
a
flank
fire
one
corner
of
this
fort
at
ashuelot
was
however
guarded
by
a
solid
blockhouse
or
as
it
was
commonly
called
a
on
the
of
april
a
band
of
sixty
or
by
another
account
a
hundred
indians
approached
the
settlement
before
daybreak
and
hid
in
the
neighboring
thickets
to
cut
off
the
men
in
the
fort
as
they
came
out
to
their
morning
work
one
of
the
men
ephraim
dorman
chanced
to
go
out
earlier
than
the
rest
the
indians
did
not
fire
on
him
but
not
to
give
an
alarm
tried
to
capture
or
kill
him
without
noise
several
of
them
suddenly
showed
themselves
on
which
he
threw
down
his
gun
in
pretended
submission
one
of
them
came
up
to
him
with
hatchet
raised
but
the
nimble
and
sturdy
borderer
suddenly
struck
him
with
his
fist
a
blow
in
the
head
that
knocked
him
flat
then
snatched
up
his
own
gun
and
as
some
say
the
blanket
of
the
savage
also
sprang
off
reached
the
fort
unhurt
and
gave
the
alarm
some
of
the
families
of
the
place
were
living
in
the
fort
but
the
bolder
or
more
careless
still
remained
in
their
farmhouses
and
if
nothing
were
done
for
their
relief
their
fate
was
sealed
therefore
the
men
sallied
in
a
body
and
a
sharp
fight
ensued
giving
the
frightened
settlers
time
to
take
refuge
within
the
stockade
it
was
not
too
soon
for
the
work
of
havoc
had
already
begun
six
houses
and
a
barn
were
on
fire
and
cattle
had
been
killed
the
indians
fought
fiercely
killed
john
bullard
and
captured
nathan
blake
but
at
last
retreated
and
after
they
were
gone
the
charred
remains
of
several
of
them
were
found
among
the
ruins
of
one
of
the
burned
cabins
where
they
had
probably
been
thrown
to
prevent
their
being
scalped
before
dorman
had
given
the
alarm
an
old
woman
mckenney
went
from
the
fort
to
milk
her
cow
in
a
neighboring
barn
as
she
was
returning
with
her
full
a
naked
indian
was
seen
to
spring
from
a
clump
of
bushes
plunge
a
long
knife
into
her
back
and
dart
away
without
stopping
to
take
the
gray
scalp
of
his
victim
she
tried
feebly
to
reach
the
fort
but
from
age
corpulence
and
a
mortal
wound
she
moved
but
slowly
and
when
a
few
steps
from
the
gate
fell
and
died
ten
days
after
a
party
of
indians
hid
themselves
at
night
by
this
same
fort
and
sent
one
of
their
number
to
gain
admission
under
pretence
of
friendship
intending
no
doubt
to
rush
in
when
the
gate
should
be
opened
but
the
man
on
guard
detected
the
trick
and
instead
of
opening
the
gate
fired
through
it
mortally
wounding
the
indian
on
which
his
confederates
made
off
again
at
the
same
place
deacon
josiah
foster
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fort
ventured
out
on
a
july
morning
to
drive
his
cows
to
pasture
a
gunshot
was
heard
and
the
men
who
went
out
to
learn
the
cause
found
the
deacon
lying
in
the
dead
and
scalped
an
ambushed
indian
had
killed
him
and
vanished
such
petty
attacks
were
without
number
there
is
a
french
paper
called
a
record
of
military
movements
which
gives
a
list
of
sent
from
montreal
against
the
english
border
between
the
of
march
and
the
of
june
in
the
same
year
they
number
distinct
bands
nearly
all
composed
of
mission
indians
living
in
or
near
the
settled
parts
of
canada
abenakis
iroquois
of
the
lake
of
two
mountains
and
of
sault
louis
caughnawaga
algonquins
of
the
ottawa
and
others
in
parties
rarely
of
more
than
thirty
and
often
of
no
more
than
six
yet
enough
for
waylaying
travellers
or
killing
women
in
kitchens
or
and
solitary
laborers
in
the
fields
this
record
is
accompanied
by
a
list
of
wild
western
indians
who
came
down
to
montreal
in
the
summer
of
to
share
in
these
military
no
part
of
the
country
suffered
more
than
the
western
borders
of
massachusetts
and
new
hampshire
and
here
were
seen
too
plainly
the
evils
of
the
prevailing
want
of
concert
among
the
british
colonies
massachusetts
claimed
extensive
tracts
north
of
her
present
northern
boundary
and
in
the
belief
that
her
claim
would
hold
good
had
built
a
small
wooden
fort
called
fort
dummer
on
the
connecticut
for
the
protection
of
settlers
new
hampshire
disputed
the
title
and
the
question
being
referred
to
the
crown
was
decided
in
her
favor
on
this
massachusetts
withdrew
the
garrison
of
fort
dummer
and
left
new
hampshire
to
defend
her
own
this
the
assembly
of
that
province
refused
to
do
on
the
ground
that
the
fort
was
fifty
miles
from
any
settlement
made
by
new
hampshire
people
and
was
therefore
useless
to
them
though
of
great
value
to
massachusetts
as
a
cover
to
northfield
and
other
of
her
settlements
lower
down
the
connecticut
to
protect
which
was
no
business
of
new
hampshire
but
some
years
before
in
three
brothers
samuel
david
and
stephen
farnsworth
natives
of
groton
massachusetts
had
begun
a
new
settlement
on
the
connecticut
about
miles
north
of
the
massachusetts
line
and
on
ground
which
was
soon
to
be
assigned
to
new
hampshire
they
were
followed
by
five
or
six
others
they
acted
on
the
belief
that
their
settlement
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
massachusetts
and
that
she
could
and
would
protect
them
the
place
was
one
of
extreme
exposure
not
only
from
its
isolation
far
from
help
but
because
it
was
on
the
banks
of
a
wild
and
lonely
river
the
customary
highway
of
on
their
descent
from
canada
number
four
for
so
the
new
settlement
was
called
because
it
was
the
fourth
in
a
range
of
townships
recently
marked
out
along
the
connecticut
but
with
one
or
two
exceptions
wholly
unoccupied
as
yet
was
a
rude
little
outpost
of
civilization
buried
in
forests
that
spread
unbroken
to
the
banks
of
the
lawrence
while
its
nearest
english
neighbor
was
nearly
thirty
miles
away
as
may
be
supposed
it
grew
slowly
and
in
it
had
but
nine
or
ten
families
in
the
preceding
year
when
war
seemed
imminent
and
it
was
clear
that
neither
massachusetts
nor
new
hampshire
would
lend
a
helping
hand
the
settlers
of
number
four
seeing
that
their
only
resource
was
in
themselves
called
a
meeting
to
consider
the
situation
and
determine
what
should
be
done
the
meeting
was
held
at
the
house
or
of
john
spafford
and
being
duly
called
to
order
the
following
resolutions
were
adopted
that
a
fort
be
built
at
the
charge
of
the
proprietors
of
the
said
township
of
number
four
that
john
hastings
john
spafford
and
john
avery
be
a
committee
to
direct
the
building
that
each
carpenter
be
allowed
nine
shillings
old
tenor
a
day
each
laborer
seven
shillings
and
each
pair
of
oxen
three
shillings
and
sixpence
that
the
proprietors
of
the
township
be
taxed
in
the
sum
of
three
hundred
pounds
old
tenor
for
building
the
fort
that
john
spafford
phineas
stevens
and
john
hastings
be
assessors
to
assess
the
same
and
samuel
farnsworth
collector
to
collect
it
and
to
the
end
that
their
fort
should
be
a
good
and
creditable
one
they
are
said
to
have
engaged
the
services
of
john
stoddard
accounted
the
foremost
man
of
western
massachusetts
superintendent
of
defence
colonel
of
militia
judge
of
probate
chief
justice
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
a
reputed
authority
in
the
construction
of
backwoods
fortifications
and
the
admired
owner
of
the
only
gold
watch
in
northampton
timber
was
abundant
and
could
be
had
for
the
asking
for
the
frontiersman
usually
regarded
a
tree
less
as
a
valuable
possession
than
as
a
natural
enemy
to
be
got
rid
of
by
fair
means
or
foul
the
only
cost
was
the
labor
the
fort
rose
rapidly
it
was
a
square
enclosing
about
three
quarters
of
an
acre
each
side
measuring
a
hundred
and
eighty
feet
the
wall
was
not
of
palisades
as
was
more
usual
but
of
squared
logs
laid
one
upon
another
and
interlocked
at
the
corners
after
the
fashion
of
a
within
were
several
houses
which
had
been
built
close
together
for
mutual
protection
before
the
fort
was
begun
and
which
belonged
to
stevens
spafford
and
other
settlers
apparently
they
were
small
for
they
were
valued
at
only
from
eight
to
pounds
each
in
old
tenor
currency
wofully
attenuated
by
depreciation
and
these
sums
being
paid
to
the
owners
out
of
the
three
hundred
pounds
collected
for
building
the
fort
the
cabins
became
public
property
either
they
were
built
in
a
straight
line
or
they
were
moved
to
form
one
for
when
the
fort
was
finished
they
all
backed
against
the
outer
wall
so
that
their
low
roofs
served
to
fire
from
the
usual
flankers
completed
the
work
and
the
settlers
of
number
four
were
so
well
pleased
with
it
that
they
proudly
declared
their
fort
a
better
one
than
fort
dummer
its
nearest
neighbor
which
had
been
built
by
public
authority
at
the
charge
of
the
province
but
a
fort
must
have
a
garrison
and
the
ten
or
twelve
men
of
number
four
would
hardly
be
a
sufficient
one
sooner
or
later
an
attack
was
certain
for
the
place
was
a
backwoods
castle
dangerous
lying
in
the
path
of
from
canada
whether
coming
down
the
connecticut
from
lake
memphremagog
or
up
otter
creek
from
lake
champlain
then
over
the
mountains
to
black
river
and
so
down
that
stream
which
would
bring
them
directly
to
number
four
new
hampshire
would
do
nothing
for
them
and
their
only
hope
was
in
massachusetts
of
which
most
of
them
were
natives
and
which
had
good
reasons
for
helping
them
to
hold
their
ground
as
a
cover
to
its
own
settlements
below
the
governor
and
assembly
of
massachusetts
did
in
fact
send
small
parties
of
armed
men
from
time
to
time
to
defend
the
endangered
outpost
and
the
succor
was
timely
for
though
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
number
four
was
left
in
peace
yet
from
the
nineteenth
of
april
to
the
nineteenth
of
june
it
was
attacked
by
indians
five
times
with
some
loss
of
scalps
and
more
of
cattle
horses
and
hogs
on
the
last
occasion
there
was
a
hot
fight
in
the
woods
ending
in
the
retreat
of
the
indians
said
to
have
numbered
a
hundred
and
fifty
into
a
swamp
leaving
behind
them
guns
blankets
hatchets
spears
and
other
things
valued
at
forty
pounds
old
tenor
which
says
the
chronicle
was
reckoned
a
great
booty
for
such
beggarly
but
massachusetts
grew
tired
of
defending
lands
that
had
been
adjudged
to
new
hampshire
and
as
the
season
drew
towards
an
end
number
four
was
left
again
to
its
own
keeping
the
settlers
saw
no
choice
but
to
abandon
a
place
which
they
were
too
few
to
defend
and
accordingly
withdrew
to
the
older
settlements
after
burying
such
of
their
effects
as
would
bear
it
and
leaving
others
to
their
fate
six
men
a
dog
and
a
cat
remained
to
keep
the
fort
towards
midwinter
the
human
part
of
the
garrison
also
withdrew
and
the
two
uncongenial
quadrupeds
were
left
alone
when
the
authorities
of
massachusetts
saw
that
a
place
so
useful
to
bear
the
brunt
of
attack
was
left
to
certain
destruction
they
repented
of
their
late
withdrawal
and
sent
captain
phineas
stevens
with
thirty
men
to
reoccupy
it
stevens
a
native
of
sudbury
massachusetts
one
of
the
earliest
settlers
of
number
four
and
one
of
its
chief
proprietors
was
a
bold
intelligent
and
determined
man
well
fitted
for
the
work
before
him
he
and
his
band
reached
the
fort
on
the
of
march
and
their
arrival
gave
peculiar
pleasure
to
its
tenants
the
dog
and
cat
the
former
of
whom
met
them
with
lively
demonstrations
of
joy
the
pair
had
apparently
lived
in
harmony
and
found
means
of
subsistence
as
they
are
reported
to
have
been
in
tolerable
condition
stevens
had
brought
with
him
a
number
of
other
dogs
animals
found
useful
for
detecting
the
presence
of
indians
and
tracking
them
to
their
a
week
or
more
after
the
arrival
of
the
party
these
canine
allies
showed
great
uneasiness
and
barked
without
ceasing
on
which
stevens
ordered
a
strict
watch
to
be
kept
and
great
precaution
to
be
used
in
opening
the
gate
of
the
fort
it
was
time
for
the
surrounding
forest
concealed
what
the
new
england
chroniclers
call
an
army
commanded
by
general
debeline
it
scarcely
need
be
said
that
canada
had
no
general
debeline
and
that
no
such
name
is
to
be
found
in
canadian
annals
the
army
was
a
large
of
both
french
and
indians
and
a
french
record
shows
that
its
commander
was
boucher
de
niverville
ensign
in
the
colony
troops
the
behavior
of
the
dogs
was
as
yet
the
only
sign
of
danger
when
about
nine
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
seventh
of
april
one
of
stevens
s
men
took
it
upon
him
to
go
out
and
find
what
was
amiss
accompanied
by
two
or
three
of
the
dogs
he
advanced
gun
in
hand
into
the
clearing
peering
at
every
stump
lest
an
indian
should
lurk
behind
it
when
about
twenty
rods
from
the
gate
he
saw
a
large
log
or
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
not
far
before
him
and
approached
it
cautiously
setting
on
the
dogs
or
as
stevens
whimsically
phrases
it
saying
to
them
they
ran
forward
barking
on
which
several
heads
appeared
above
the
log
and
several
guns
were
fired
at
him
he
was
slightly
wounded
but
escaped
to
the
fort
then
all
around
the
air
rang
with
and
a
storm
of
bullets
flew
from
the
tangle
of
bushes
that
edged
the
clearing
and
rapped
spitefully
but
harmlessly
against
the
wooden
wall
at
a
little
distance
on
the
windward
side
was
a
to
which
with
adjacent
fences
the
assailants
presently
set
fire
in
the
hope
that
as
the
wind
was
strong
the
flames
would
catch
the
fort
when
stevens
saw
what
they
were
doing
he
set
himself
to
thwart
them
and
while
some
of
his
men
kept
them
at
bay
with
their
guns
the
rest
fell
to
work
digging
a
number
of
short
trenches
under
the
wall
on
the
side
towards
the
fire
as
each
trench
was
six
or
seven
feet
deep
a
man
could
stand
in
it
outside
the
wall
sheltered
from
bullets
and
dash
buckets
of
water
passed
to
him
from
within
against
the
scorching
timbers
eleven
such
trenches
were
dug
and
eleven
men
were
stationed
in
them
so
that
the
whole
exposed
front
of
the
wall
was
kept
wet
thus
though
clouds
of
smoke
drifted
over
the
fort
and
burning
cinders
showered
upon
it
no
harm
was
done
and
the
enemy
was
forced
to
other
devices
they
found
a
wagon
which
they
protected
from
water
and
bullets
by
a
shield
of
planks
for
there
was
a
hard
by
and
loaded
it
with
dry
fagots
thinking
to
set
them
on
fire
and
push
the
blazing
machine
against
a
dry
part
of
the
fort
wall
but
the
task
proved
too
dangerous
for
says
stevens
instead
of
performing
what
they
threatened
and
seemed
to
be
immediately
going
to
undertake
they
called
to
us
and
desired
a
cessation
of
arms
till
sunrise
the
next
morning
which
was
granted
at
which
time
they
said
they
would
come
to
a
in
fact
the
french
commander
with
about
sixty
of
his
men
came
in
the
morning
with
a
flag
of
truce
which
he
stuck
in
the
ground
at
a
from
the
fort
and
in
the
words
of
stevens
said
if
we
would
send
three
men
to
him
he
would
send
as
many
to
stevens
agreed
to
this
on
which
two
frenchmen
and
an
indian
came
to
the
fort
and
three
soldiers
went
out
in
return
the
two
frenchmen
demanded
on
the
part
of
their
commander
that
the
garrison
should
surrender
under
a
promise
of
life
and
be
carried
prisoners
to
quebec
and
they
farther
required
that
stevens
should
give
his
answer
to
the
french
officer
in
person
wisely
or
unwisely
stevens
went
out
at
the
gate
and
was
at
once
joined
by
niverville
attended
no
doubt
by
an
interpreter
upon
meeting
the
monsieur
says
the
english
captain
he
did
not
wait
for
me
to
give
him
an
answer
but
said
in
a
manner
sufficiently
peremptory
that
he
had
seven
hundred
men
with
him
and
that
if
his
terms
were
refused
he
would
storm
the
fort
run
over
it
burn
it
to
the
ground
and
if
resistance
were
offered
put
all
in
it
to
the
sword
adding
that
he
would
have
it
or
die
and
that
stevens
might
fight
or
not
as
he
pleased
for
it
was
all
one
to
him
his
terms
being
refused
he
said
as
stevens
reports
well
go
back
to
your
fort
and
see
if
your
men
dare
fight
any
more
and
give
me
an
answer
quickly
for
my
men
want
to
be
stevens
now
acted
as
if
he
had
been
the
moderator
of
a
i
went
into
the
fort
and
called
the
men
together
and
informed
them
what
the
general
said
and
then
put
it
to
vote
whether
they
would
fight
or
resign
and
they
voted
to
a
man
to
stand
it
out
and
also
declared
that
they
would
fight
as
long
as
they
had
answer
was
made
accordingly
but
niverville
s
promise
to
storm
the
fort
and
run
over
it
was
not
kept
stevens
says
that
his
enemies
had
not
the
courage
to
do
this
or
even
to
bring
up
their
fortification
meaning
their
with
its
shield
of
planks
in
fact
an
open
assault
upon
a
fortified
place
was
a
thing
unknown
in
this
border
warfare
whether
waged
by
indians
alone
or
by
french
and
indians
together
the
assailants
only
raised
the
again
and
fired
as
before
from
behind
stumps
logs
and
bushes
this
amusement
they
kept
up
from
two
o
clock
till
night
when
they
grew
bolder
approached
nearer
and
shot
flights
of
into
the
fort
which
water
being
abundant
were
harmless
as
their
bullets
at
daylight
they
gave
over
this
exercise
called
out
good
morning
to
the
garrison
and
asked
for
a
suspension
of
arms
for
two
hours
this
being
agreed
to
another
flag
of
truce
presently
appeared
carried
by
two
indians
who
planted
it
in
the
ground
within
a
stone
s
throw
of
the
fort
and
asked
that
two
men
should
be
sent
out
to
confer
with
them
this
was
done
and
the
men
soon
came
back
with
a
proposal
that
stevens
should
sell
provisions
to
his
besiegers
under
a
promise
on
their
part
that
they
would
give
him
no
farther
trouble
he
answered
that
he
would
not
sell
them
provisions
for
money
but
would
exchange
them
for
prisoners
and
give
five
bushels
of
indian
corn
for
every
hostage
placed
in
his
hands
as
security
for
the
release
of
an
english
captive
in
canada
to
this
their
only
answer
was
firing
a
few
shots
against
the
fort
after
which
they
all
disappeared
and
were
seen
no
more
the
garrison
had
scarcely
eaten
or
slept
for
three
days
i
believe
men
were
never
known
to
hold
out
with
better
resolution
writes
stevens
and
though
there
were
some
thousands
of
guns
shot
at
us
we
had
but
two
men
slightly
wounded
john
brown
and
joseph
niverville
and
his
party
disappointed
and
hungry
now
made
a
tour
among
the
scattered
farms
and
hamlets
of
the
country
below
which
incapable
of
resisting
such
an
inroad
were
abandoned
at
their
approach
thus
they
took
an
easy
revenge
for
their
rebuff
at
number
four
and
in
a
march
of
thirty
or
forty
leagues
burned
five
small
deserted
forts
or
stockaded
houses
three
several
fine
barns
about
one
hundred
dwellings
mostly
of
two
stories
furnished
even
to
chests
of
drawers
and
killed
five
to
six
hundred
sheep
and
hogs
and
about
thirty
horned
cattle
this
devastation
is
well
worth
a
few
prisoners
or
it
is
curious
to
find
such
exploits
mentioned
with
complacency
as
evidence
of
prowess
the
successful
defence
of
the
most
exposed
place
on
the
frontier
was
welcome
news
throughout
new
england
and
commodore
charles
knowles
who
was
then
at
boston
sent
stevens
a
sword
in
recognition
of
his
conduct
the
settlers
of
number
four
who
soon
returned
to
their
backwoods
home
were
so
well
pleased
with
this
compliment
to
one
of
their
fellows
that
they
gave
to
the
settlement
the
baptismal
name
of
the
commodore

the

had
pushed
westward

the
beautiful
region
of
mountains
and
valleys
that
now
forms
berkshire

housatonic
and
an

had
been
attempted
at

now
pittsfield
on
the
extreme
western
limits
of
the
province
the
position
of
these
new
settlements
was
critical
for
the
enemy
could
reach
them
with
little
difficulty
by
way
of
lake
champlain
and
wood
creek
the
massachusetts
government
was
not
unmindful
of
them
and
when
war
again
broke
out
three
wooden
forts
were
built
for
their
protection
forming
a
line
of
defence
westward
from
northfield
on
the
northern
frontier
of
the
province
one
of
these
forts
was
in
the
present
town
of
heath
and
was
called
fort
shirley
another
named
fort
pelham
was
in
the
present
town
of
rowe
while
the
third
fort
massachusetts
was
farther
westward
in
what
is
now
the
town
of
adams
then
known
as
east
hoosac
two
hundred
men
from
the
militia
were
taken
into
pay
to
hold
these
posts
and
patrol
the
intervening
forests
other
defensive
works
were
made
here
and
there
sometimes
by
the
votes
of
town
meetings
and
sometimes
by
individuals
at
their
own
cost
these
works
consisted
of
a
fence
of
palisades
enclosing
a
farmhouse
or
sometimes
of
a
blockhouse
of
timber
or
heavy
planks
thus
at
northfield
deacon
ebenezer
alexander
a
veteran
of
sixty
who
had
served
at
louisbourg
built
a
mount
or
blockhouse
on
the
knoll
behind
his
house
and
carried
a
stockade
from
it
to
enclose
the
dwelling
shed
and
barn
the
whole
at
the
cost
of
pounds
one
shilling
and
sixpence
in
massachusetts
currency
which
the
town
repaid
him
his
fortifications
being
of
public
utility
as
a
place
of
refuge
for
families
in
case
of
attack
northfield
was
a
place
notoriously
dangerous
and
military
methods
were
in
vogue
there
in
season
and
out
of
season
thus
by
a
vote
of
the
town
the
people
were
called
to
the
sunday
sermon
by
beat
of
drum
and
eleazer
holton
was
elected
to
sound
the
call
in
consideration
of
one
pound
and
ten
shillings
a
year
the
drum
being
hired
of
ensign
field
its
fortunate
possessor
for
the
farther
sum
of
three
shillings
this
was
in
the
earlier
days
of
northfield
in
the
sunday
was
stopped
and
the
worshippers
were
summoned
by
the
less
obstreperous
method
of
hanging
out
a
flagg
for
the
faithful
discharge
of
which
function
daniel
wright
received
in
one
pound
and
five
shillings
the
various
fortifications
public
and
private
were
garrisoned
sometimes
by
the
owner
and
his
neighbors
sometimes
by
men
in
pay
of
the
provincial
assembly
as
was
to
be
expected
from
a
legislative
body
undertaking
warlike
operations
the
work
of
defence
was
but
indifferently
conducted
john
stoddard
the
village
magnate
of
northampton
was
charged
among
the
rest
of
his
multifarious
employments
with
the
locating
and
construction
of
forts
captain
ephraim
williams
was
assigned
to
the
general
command
on
the
western
frontier
with
headquarters
at
fort
shirley
and
afterwards
at
fort
massachusetts
and
major

rev
benjamin
doolittle
minister
apothecary
physician
and
surgeon
of
the
village
for
he
had
studied
medicine
no
less
than
theology
his
parishioners
thought
that
his
cure
of
bodies
encroached
on
his
cure
of
souls
and
requested
him
to
confine
his
attention
to
his
spiritual
charge
to
which
he
replied
that
he
could
not
afford
it
his
salary
as
minister
being
pounds
in
irredeemable
massachusetts
paper
while
his
medical
and
surgical
practice
brought
him
full
four
hundred
a
year
he
offered
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
his
flock
if
they
would
add
that
amount
to
his
salary
which
they
were
not
prepared
to
do
and
the
minister
continued
his
heterogeneous
labors
as
before
as
the
position
of
his
house
on
the
village
street
seems
to
have
been
regarded
as
strategic
the
town
voted
to
fortify
it
with
a
blockhouse
and
a
stockade
for
the
benefit
both
of
the
occupant
and
of
all
the
villagers
this
was
accordingly
done
at
the
cost
of
eighteen
pounds
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
for
the
blockhouse
and
a
farther
charge
for
the
stockade
and
thenceforth
doolittle
could
write
his
sermons
and
mix
his
doses
in
peace
to
his
other
callings
he
added
that
of
historiographer
when
after
a
ministry
of
years
the
thrifty
pastor
was
busied
one
day
with
hammer
and
nails
in
mending
the
fence
of
his
yard
he
suddenly
dropped
dead
from
a
stroke
of
to
the
grief
of
all
northfield
and
his
papers
being
searched
a
record
was
found
in
his
handwriting
of
the
inroads
of
the
enemy
that
had
happened
in
his
time
on
or
near
the
massachusetts
border
being
rightly
thought
worthy
of
publication
it
was
printed
at
boston
in
a
dingy
pamphlet
now
extremely
rare
and
much
prized
by
antiquarians
appended
to
it
are
the
remarks
of
the
author
on
the
conduct
of
the
war
he
complains
that
plans
are
changed
so
often
that
none
of
them
take
effect
that
terms
of
enlistment
are
so
short
that
the
commissary
can
hardly
serve
out
provisions
to
the
men
before
their
time
is
expired
that
neither
bread
meat
shoes
nor
blankets
are
kept
on
hand
for
an
emergency
so
that
the
enemy
escape
while
the
soldiers
are
getting
ready
to
pursue
them
that
the
pay
of
a
drafted
man
is
so
small
that
twice
as
much
would
not
hire
a
laborer
to
take
care
of
his
farm
in
his
absence
and
that
untried
and
unfit
persons
are
commissioned
as
officers
in
all
of
which
strictures
there
is
no
doubt
much
truth
doolittle
s
rueful
narrative
treats
mainly
of
miscellaneous
murders
and
scalpings
interesting
only
to
the
sufferers
and
their
friends
but
he
also
chronicles
briefly
a
formidable
inroad
that
still
holds
a
place
in
new
england
history
it
may
be
remembered
that
shirley
had
devised
a
plan
for
capturing
fort
frédéric
or
crown
point
built
by
the
french
at
the
narrows
of
lake
champlain
and
commanding
ready
access
for
to
new
york
and
new
england
the
approach
of
d
anville
s
fleet
had
defeated
the
plan
but
rumors
of
it
had
reached
canada
and
excited
great
alarm
large
bodies
of
men
were
ordered
to
lake
champlain
to
protect
the
threatened
fort
the
two
brothers
de
muy
were
already
on
the
lake
with
a
numerous
party
of
canadians
and
indians
both
christian
and
heathen
and
rigaud
de
vaudreuil
of
three
rivers
was
ordered
to
follow
with
a
still
larger
force
repel
any
english
attack
or
if
none
should
be
made
take
the
offensive
and
strike
a
blow
at
the
english
frontier
on
the
third
of
august
rigaud
left
montreal
with
a
fleet
of
canoes
carrying
what
he
calls
his
army
and
on
the
twelfth
he
encamped
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
at
the
mouth
of
otter
creek
there
was
rain
thunder
and
a
violent
wind
all
night
but
the
storm
ceased
at
daybreak
and
embarking
again
they
soon
saw
the
octagonal
stone
tower
of
fort
frédéric
the
party
set
up
their
tents
and
wigwams
near
the
fort
and
on
the
morning
of
the
sixteenth
the
elder
de
muy
arrived
with
a
reinforcement
of
sixty
frenchmen
and
a
band
of
indians
they
had
just
returned
from
an
incursion
towards
albany
and
reported
that
all
was
quiet
in
those
parts
and
that
fort
frédéric
was
in
no
danger
now
to
their
great
satisfaction
rigaud
and
his
band
saw
themselves
free
to
take
the
offensive
the
question
was
where
to
strike
the
indians
held
council
after
council
made
speech
after
speech
and
agreed
on
nothing
rigaud
gave
them
a
and
told
them
that
he
meant
to
attack
corlaer
that
is
schenectady
at
which
they
seemed
well
pleased
and
sang
all
night
in
the
morning
they
changed
their
minds
and
begged
him
to
call
the
whole
army
to
a
council
for
debating
the
question
it
appeared
that
some
of
them
especially
the
iroquois
converts
of
caughnawaga
disapproved
of
attacking
schenectady
because
some
of
their
mohawk
relatives
were
always
making
visits
there
and
might
be
inadvertently
killed
by
the
wild
western
indians
of
rigaud
s
party
now
all
was
doubt
again
for
as
indians
are
unstable
as
water
it
was
no
easy
task
to
hold
them
to
any
plan
of
action
the
abenakis
proposed
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
they
knew
the
new
england
border
well
for
many
of
them
had
lived
upon
it
before
the
war
on
terms
of
friendly
intercourse
with
the
settlers
they
now
drew
upon
the
floor
of
the
a
rough
map
of
the
country
on
which
was
seen
a
certain
river
and
on
its
upper
waters
a
fort
which
they
recommended
as
a
proper
object
of
attack
the
river
was
that
eastern
tributary
of
the
hudson
which
the
french
called
the
kaskékouké
the
dutch
the
schaticook
and
the
english
the
hoosac
the
fort
was
fort
massachusetts
the
most
westerly
of
the
three
posts
lately
built
to
guard
the
frontier
my
father
said
the
abenaki
spokesman
to
rigaud
it
will
be
easy
to
take
this
fort
and
make
great
havoc
on
the
lands
of
the
english
deign
to
listen
to
your
children
and
follow
our
one
cadenaret
an
abenaki
chief
had
been
killed
near
fort
massachusetts
in
the
last
spring
and
his
tribesmen
were
keen
to
revenge
him
seeing
his
indians
pleased
with
the
proposal
to
march
for
the
hoosac
rigaud
gladly
accepted
it
on
which
whoops
yelps
and
filled
the
air
hardly
however
was
the
party
on
its
way
when
the
indians
changed
their
minds
again
and
wanted
to
attack
saratoga
but
rigaud
told
them
that
they
had
made
their
choice
and
must
abide
by
it
to
which
they
assented
and
gave
him
no
farther
trouble
on
the
twentieth
of
august
they
all
embarked
and
paddled
southward
passed
the
lonely
promontory
where
fort
ticonderoga
was
afterwards
built
and
held
their

canal

nine
summers
later
passed
the
flotilla
of
baron
dieskau
bound
to
defeat
and
ruin
by
the
shores
of

george
rigaud
stopped
at
a
place
known
as
east
bay
at
the
mouth
of
a
stream
that
joins
wood
creek
just
north
of
the
present
town
of
whitehall
here
he
left
the
younger
de
muy
with
thirty
men
to
guard
the
canoes
the
rest
of
the
party
guided
by
a
brother
of
the
slain
cadenaret
filed
southward
on
foot
along
the
base
of
skene
mountain
that
overlooks
whitehall
they
counted
about
seven
hundred
men
of
whom
five
hundred
were
french
and
a
little
above
two
hundred
were
indians
some
other
french
reports
put
the
whole
number
at
eleven
hundred
or
even
twelve
hundred
while
several
english
accounts
make
it
eight
hundred
or
nine
hundred
the
frenchmen
of
the
party
included
both
regulars
and
canadians
with
six
regular
officers
and
ten
cadets
eighteen
militia
officers
two
chaplains
one
for
the
whites
and
one
for
the
indians
and
a
surgeon
after
a
march
of
four
days
they
encamped
on
the
by
a
stream
which
ran
into
the
hudson
and
was
no
doubt
the
batten
kill
known
to
the
french
as
rivière
de
being
nearly
opposite
saratoga
where
there
was
then
a
garrison
they
changed
their
course
on
the
from
south
to
southeast
the
better
to
avoid
which
might
discover
their
trail
and
defeat
their
plan
of
surprise
early
on
the
next
day
they
reached
the
hoosac
far
above
its
mouth
and
now
their
march
was
easier
for
says
rigaud
we
got
out
of
the
woods
and
followed
a
large
road
that
led
up
the
in
fact
there
seem
to
have
been
two
roads
one
on
each
side
of
the
hoosac
for
the
french
were
formed
into
two
brigades
one
of
which
under
the
sieur
de
la
valterie
filed
along
the
right
bank
of
the
stream
and
the
other
under
the
sieur
de
sabrevois
along
the
left
while
the
indians
marched
on
the
front
flanks
and
rear
they
passed
deserted
houses
and
farms
belonging
to
dutch
settlers
from
the
hudson
for
the
hoosac
in
this
part
of
its
course
was
in
the
province
of
new
york
they
did
not
stop
to
burn
barns
and
houses
but
they
killed
poultry
hogs
a
cow
and
a
horse
to
supply
themselves
with
meat
before
night
they
had
passed
the
new
york
line
and
they
made
their
camp
in
or
near
the
valley
where
williamstown
and
williams
college
now
stand
here
they
were
joined
by
the
sieurs
beaubassin
and
la
force
who
had
gone
forward
with
eight
indians
to
reconnoitre
beaubassin
had
watched
fort
massachusetts
from
a
distance
and
had
seen
a
man
go
up
into
the
but
could
discover
no
other
sign
of
alarm
apparently
the
fugitive
dutch
farmers
had
not
taken
pains
to
warn
the
english
garrison
of
the
coming
danger
for
there
was
a
coolness
between
the
neighbors
before
breaking
up
camp
in
the
morning
rigaud
called
the
indian
chiefs
together
and
said
to
them
my
children
the
time
is
near
when
we
must
get
other
meat
than
fresh
pork
and
we
will
all
eat
it
meat
in
indian
parlance
meant
prisoners
and
as
these
were
valuable
by
reason
of
the
ransoms
paid
for
them
and
as
the
indians
had
suspected
that
the
french
meant
to
keep
them
all
they
were
well
pleased
with
this
figurative
assurance
of
rigaud
that
they
should
have
their
share
the
chaplain
said
mass
and
the
party
marched
in
a
brisk
rain
up
the
williamstown
valley
till
after
advancing
about
ten
miles
they
encamped
again
fort
massachusetts
was
only
three
or
four
miles
distant
rigaud
held
a
talk
with
the
abenaki
chiefs
who
had
acted
as
guides
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
party
should
stop
in
the
woods
near
the
fort
make
to
burst
the
gates
and
other
things
needful
for
a
grand
assault
to
take
place
before
daylight
but
their
plan
came
to
nought
through
the
impetuosity
of
the
young
indians
and
canadians
who
were
so
excited
at
the
first
glimpse
of
the
of
the
fort
that
they
dashed
forward
as
rigaud
says
like
hence
one
might
fairly
expect
to
see
the
fort
assaulted
at
once
but
by
the
maxims
of
forest
war
this
would
have
been
reprehensible
rashness
and
nothing
of
the
kind
was
attempted
the
assailants
spread
to
right
and
left
squatted
behind
stumps
and
opened
a
distant
and
harmless
fire
accompanied
with
unearthly
yells
and
howlings
fort
massachusetts
was
a
wooden
enclosure
formed
like
the
fort
at
number
four
of
beams
laid
one
upon
another
and
interlocked
at
the
angles
this
wooden
wall
seems
to
have
rested
not
immediately
upon
the
ground
but
upon
a
foundation
of
stone
designated
by
norton
the
chaplain
as
the
underpinning
a
name
usually
given
in
new
england
to
foundations
of
the
kind
at
the
northwest
corner
was
a
blockhouse
crowned
with
the
the
sight
of
which
had
prematurely
kindled
the
martial
fire
of
the
canadians
and
indians
this
wooden
structure
at
the
apex
of
the
blockhouse
served
as
a
lookout
and
also
supplied
means
of
throwing
water
to
extinguish
shot
upon
the
roof
there
were
other
buildings
in
the
enclosure
especially
a
large
on
the
south
side
which
seems
to
have
overlooked
the
outer
wall
and
was
no
doubt
for
musketry
on
the
east
side
there
was
a
well
furnished
probably
with
one
of
those
long
universal
in
primitive
new
england
the
garrison
when
complete
consisted
of
men
under
captain
ephraim
williams
who
has
left
his
name
to
williamstown
and
williams
college
of
the
latter
of
which
he
was
the
founder
he
was
born
at
newton
near
boston
was
a
man
vigorous
in
body
and
mind
better
acquainted
with
the
world
than
most
of
his
countrymen
having
followed
the
seas
in
his
youth
and
visited
england
spain
and
holland
frank
and
agreeable
in
manners
well
fitted
for
such
a
command
and
respected
and
loved
by
his
men
when
the
proposed
invasion
of
canada
was
preparing
he
and
some
of
his
men
went
to
take
part
in
it
and
had
not
yet
returned
the
fort
was
left
in
charge
of
a
sergeant
john
hawks
of
deerfield
with
men
too
few
for
the
extent
of
the
works
and
a
supply
of
ammunition
nearly
exhausted
canada
being
then
put
on
the
defensive
the
frontier
forts
were
thought
safe
for
a
time
on
the
saturday
before
rigaud
s
arrival
hawks
had
sent
thomas
williams
the
surgeon
brother
of
the
absent
captain
to
deerfield
with
a
detachment
of
fourteen
men
to
get
a
supply
of
powder
and
lead
this
detachment
reduced
the
entire
force
including
hawks
himself
and
norton
the
chaplain
to
men
half
of
whom
were
disabled
with
dysentery
from
which
few
of
the
rest
were
wholly
free
there
were
also
in
the
fort
three
women
and
five
children
the
site
of
fort
massachusetts
is
now
a
meadow
by
the
banks
of
the
hoosac
then
it
was
a
rough
clearing
encumbered
with
the
stumps
and
refuse
of
the
primeval
forest
whose
living
hosts
stood
grimly
around
it
and
spread
untouched
by
the
axe
up
the
sides
of
the
neighboring
saddleback
mountain
the
position
of
the
fort
was
bad
being
commanded
by
high
ground
from
which
as
the
chaplain
tells
us
the
enemy
could
shoot
over
the
north
side
into
the
middle
of
the
parade
for
which
serious
defect
john
stoddard
of
northampton
legist
capitalist
colonel
of
militia
and
superintendent
of
defence
was
probably
answerable
these
frontier
forts
were
however
often
placed
on
low
ground
with
a
view
to
an
abundant
supply
of
water
fire
being
the
most
dreaded
enemy
in
indian
warfare
sergeant
hawks
the
provisional
commander
was
according
to
tradition
a
tall
man
with
sunburnt
features
erect
spare
very
sinewy
and
strong
and
of
a
bold
and
resolute
temper
he
had
need
to
be
so
for
counting
every
man
in
the
fort
lay
and
clerical
sick
and
well
he
was
beset
by
more
than
thirty
times
his
own
number
or
counting
only
his
effective
men
by
more
than
sixty
times
and
this
at
the
lowest
report
of
the
attacking
force
as
there
was
nothing
but
a
log
fence
between
him
and
his
enemy
it
was
clear
that
they
could
hew
or
burn
a
way
through
it
or
climb
over
it
with
no
surprising
effort
of
valor
rigaud
as
we
have
seen
had
planned
a
general
assault
under
cover
of
night
but
had
been
thwarted
by
the
precipitancy
of
the
young
indians
and
canadians
these
now
showed
no
inclination
to
depart
from
the
cautious
maxims
of
forest
warfare
they
made
a
terrific
noise
but
when
they
came
within
gunshot
of
the
fort
it
was
by
darting
from
stump
to
stump
with
a
quick
zigzag
movement
that
made
them
more
difficult
to
hit
than
birds
on
the
wing
the
best
moment
for
a
shot
was
when
they
reached
a
stump
and
stopped
for
an
instant
to
duck
and
hide
behind
it
by
seizing
this
fleeting
opportunity
hawks
himself
put
a
bullet
into
the
breast
of
an
abenaki
chief
from
francis
which
ended
his
days
says
the
chaplain
in
view
of
the
nimbleness
of
the
assailants
a
charge
of
buckshot
was
found
more
to
the
purpose
than
a
bullet
besides
the
slain
abenaki
rigaud
reports
sixteen
indians
and
frenchman
wounded
which
under
the
circumstances
was
good
execution
for
ten
farmers
and
a
minister
for
chaplain
norton
loaded
and
fired
with
the
rest
rigaud
himself
was
one
of
the
wounded
having
been
hit
in
the
arm
and
sent
to
the
rear
as
he
stood
giving
orders
on
the
rocky
hill
about
forty
rods
from
the
fort
probably
it
was
a
chance
shot
since
though
rifles
were
invented
long
before
they
were
not
yet
in
general
use
and
the
yeoman
garrison
were
armed
with
nothing
but
their
own
not
to
be
trusted
at
long
range
the
supply
of
ammunition
had
sunk
so
low
that
hawks
was
forced
to
give
the
discouraging
order
not
to
fire
except
when
necessary
to
keep
the
enemy
in
check
or
when
the
chance
of
hitting
him
should
be
unusually
good
such
of
the
sick
men
as
were
strong
enough
aided
the
defence
by
casting
bullets
and
buckshot
the
outrageous
noise
lasted
till
towards
nine
in
the
evening
when
the
assailants
greeted
the
fort
with
a
general
and
repeated
it
three
or
four
times
then
a
line
of
sentinels
was
placed
around
it
to
prevent
messengers
from
carrying
the
alarm
to
albany
or
deerfield
the
evening
was
dark
and
cloudy
the
lights
of
a
camp
could
be
seen
by
the
river
towards
the
southeast
and
those
of
another
near
the
swamp
towards
the
west
there
was
a
sound
of
axes
as
if
the
enemy
were
making
for
a
night
assault
but
it
was
found
that
they
were
cutting
fagots
to
burn
the
wall
hawks
ordered
every
tub
and
bucket
to
be
filled
with
water
in
preparation
for
the
crisis
two
men
john
aldrich
and
jonathan
bridgman
had
been
wounded
thus
farther
reducing
the
strength
of
the
defenders
the
chaplain
says
of
those
that
were
in
health
some
were
ordered
to
keep
the
watch
and
some
lay
down
and
endeavored
to
get
some
rest
lying
down
in
our
clothes
with
our
arms
by
us
we
got
little
or
no
rest
the
enemy
frequently
raised
us
by
their
hideous
outcries
as
though
they
were
about
to
attack
us
the
latter
part
of
the
night
i
kept
the
rigaud
spent
the
night
in
preparing
for
a
decisive
attack
being
resolved
to
open
trenches
two
hours
before
sunrise
and
push
them
to
the
foot
of
the
palisade
so
as
to
place
fagots
against
it
set
them
on
fire
and
deliver
the
fort
a
prey
to
the
fury
of
the
it
began
to
rain
and
he
determined
to
wait
till
morning
that
the
commander
of
seven
hundred
french
and
indians
should
resort
to
such
elaborate
devices
to
subdue
a
sergeant
seven
and
a
minister
for
this
was
now
the
effective
strength
of
the
besieged
was
no
small
compliment
to
the
spirit
of
the
defence
the
firing
was
renewed
in
the
morning
but
there
was
no
attempt
to
open
trenches
by
daylight
two
men
were
sent
up
into
the
and
about
eleven
o
clock
one
of
them
thomas
knowlton
was
shot
through
the
head
the
number
of
effectives
was
thus
reduced
to
eight
including
the
chaplain
up
to
this
time
the
french
and
english
witnesses
are
in
tolerable
accord
but
now
there
is
conflict
of
evidence
rigaud
says
that
when
he
was
about
to
carry
his
plan
of
attack
into
execution
he
saw
a
white
flag
hung
out
and
sent
the
elder
de
muy
with
montigny
and
d
auteuil
to
hear
what
the
english
commandant
whose
humble
rank
he
nowhere
mentions
had
to
say
on
the
other
hand
norton
the
chaplain
says
that
about
noon
the
french
desired
to
parley
and
that
we
agreed
to
he
says
farther
that
the
sergeant
with
himself
and
one
or
two
others
met
rigaud
outside
the
gate
and
that
the
french
commander
promised
good
quarter
to
the
besieged
if
they
would
surrender
with
the
alternative
of
an
assault
if
they
would
not
this
account
is
sustained
by
hawks
who
says
that
at
twelve
o
clock
an
indian
came
forward
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
that
he
hawks
with
two
or
three
others
went
to
meet
rigaud
who
then
offered
honorable
terms
of
capitulation
the
sergeant
promised
an
answer
within
two
hours
and
going
back
to
the
fort
with
his
companions
examined
their
means
of
defence
he
found
that
they
had
left
but
three
or
four
pounds
of
gunpowder
and
about
as
much
lead
hawks
called
a
council
of
his
effective
men
norton
prayed
for
divine
aid
and
guidance
and
then
they
fell
to
considering
the
situation
had
we
all
been
in
health
or
had
there
been
only
those
eight
of
us
that
were
in
health
i
believe
every
man
would
willingly
have
stood
it
out
to
the
last
for
my
part
i
should
writes
the
manful
chaplain
but
besides
the
sick
and
wounded
there
were
three
women
and
five
children
who
if
the
fort
were
taken
by
assault
would
no
doubt
be
butchered
by
the
indians
but
who
might
be
saved
by
a
capitulation
hawks
therefore
resolved
to
make
the
best
terms
he
could
he
had
defended
his
post
against
prodigious
odds
for
hours
rigaud
promised
that
all
in
the
fort
should
be
treated
with
humanity
as
prisoners
of
war
and
exchanged
at
the
first
opportunity
he
also
promised
that
none
of
them
should
be
given
to
the
indians
though
he
had
lately
assured
his
savage
allies
that
they
should
have
their
share
of
the
prisoners
at
three
o
clock
the
principal
french
officers
were
admitted
into
the
fort
and
the
french
flag
was
raised
over
it
the
indians
and
canadians
were
excluded
on
which
some
of
the
indians
pulled
out
several
of
the
stones
that
formed
the
foundation
of
the
wall
crawled
through
opened
the
gate
and
let
in
the
whole
crew
they
raised
a
yell
when
they
saw
the
blood
of
thomas
knowlton
trickling
from
the
where
he
had
been
shot
then
rushed
up
to
where
the
corpse
lay
brought
it
down
scalped
it
and
cut
off
the
head
and
arms
the
fort
was
then
plundered
set
on
fire
and
burned
to
the
ground
the
prisoners
were
led
to
the
french
camp
and
here
the
chaplain
was
presently
accosted
by
one
doty
rigaud
s
interpreter
who
begged
him
to
persuade
some
of
the
prisoners
to
go
with
the
indians
norton
replied
that
it
had
been
agreed
that
they
should
all
remain
with
the
french
and
that
to
give
up
any
of
them
to
the
indians
would
be
a
breach
of
the
capitulation
doty
then
appealed
to
the
men
themselves
who
all
insisted
on
being
left
with
the
french
according
to
the
terms
stipulated
some
of
them
however
were
given
to
the
indians
who
after
rigaud
s
promise
to
them
could
have
been
pacified
in
no
other
way
his
fault
was
in
making
a
stipulation
that
he
could
not
keep
hawks
and
norton
with
all
the
women
and
children
remained
in
the
french
camp
hearing
that
men
were
expected
from
deerfield
to
take
the
places
of
the
sick
rigaud
sent
sixty
indians
to
cut
them
off
they
lay
in
wait
for
the
english
reinforcement
which
consisted
of
nineteen
men
gave
them
a
close
fire
shot
down
fifteen
of
them
and
captured
the
rest
this
or
another
party
of
rigaud
s
indians
pushed
as
far
as
deerfield
and
tried
to
waylay
the
farmers
as
they
went
to
their
work
on
a
monday
morning
the
indians
hid
in
a
growth
of
along
the
edge
of
a
meadow
where
men
were
making
hay
accompanied
by
some
children
one
ebenezer
hawks
shooting
partridges
came
so
near
the
ambushed
warriors
that
they
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
killing
and
scalping
him
this
alarmed
the
haymakers
and
the
children
who
ran
for
their
lives
towards
a
mill
on
a
brook
that
entered
deerfield
river
fiercely
pursued
by
about
fifty
indians
who
caught
and
scalped
a
boy
named
amsden
three
men
allen
sadler
and
gillet
got
under
the
bank
of
the
river
and
fired
on
the
pursuers
allen
and
gillet
were
soon
killed
but
sadler
escaped
unhurt
to
an
island
three
children
of
allen
eunice
samuel
and
caleb
were
also
chased
by
the
indians
who
knocked
down
eunice
with
a
tomahawk
but
were
in
too
much
haste
to
stop
and
scalp
her
and
she
lived
to
a
good
old
age
her
brother
samuel
was
caught
and
dragged
off
but
caleb
ran
into
a
field
of
tall
maize
and
escaped
the
firing
was
heard
in
the
village
and
a
few
armed
men
under
lieutenant
clesson
hastened
to
the
rescue
but
when
they
reached
the
spot
the
indians
were
gone
carrying
the
boy
samuel
allen
with
them
and
leaving
two
of
their
own
number
dead
clesson
with
such
men
as
he
had
followed
their
trail
up
deerfield
river
but
could
not
overtake
the
savages
meanwhile
the
prisoners
at
fort
massachusetts
spent
the
first
night
well
guarded
in
the
french
and
indian
camps
in
the
morning
norton
accompanied
by
a
frenchman
and
several
indians
was
permitted
to
nail
to
one
of
the
charred
posts
of
the
fort
a
note
to
tell
what
had
happened
to
him
and
his
companions
the
victors
then
marched
back
as
they
had
come
along
the
hoosac
road
they
moved
slowly
encumbered
as
they
were
by
the
sick
and
wounded
rigaud
gave
the
indians
presents
to
induce
them
to
treat
their
prisoners
with
humanity
norton
was
in
charge
of
de
muy
and
after
walking
four
miles
sat
down
with
him
to
rest
in
williamstown
valley
there
was
a
yell
from
the
indians
in
the
rear
i
trembled
writes
norton
thinking
they
had
murdered
some
of
our
people
but
was
filled
with
admiration
when
i
saw
all
our
prisoners
come
up
with
us
and
john
aldrich
carried
on
the
back
of
his
indian
aldrich
had
been
shot
in
the
foot
and
could
not
walk
we
set
out
again
and
had
gone
but
a
little
way
before
we
came
up
with
josiah
reed
was
extremely
ill
and
could
go
no
farther
norton
thought
that
the
indians
would
kill
him
instead
of
which
one
of
them
carried
him
on
his
back
they
were
said
to
have
killed
him
soon
after
but
there
is
good
reason
to
think
that
he
died
of
disease
i
saw
john
perry
s
wife
pursues
the
chaplain
she
complained
that
she
was
almost
ready
to
give
the
indians
threatened
her
but
hawks
spoke
in
her
behalf
to
rigaud
who
remonstrated
with
them
and
they
afterwards
treated
her
well
the
wife
of
another
soldier
john
smead
was
near
her
time
and
had
lingered
behind
the
french
showed
her
great
kindness
some
of
them
made
a
seat
for
her
to
sit
upon
and
brought
her
to
the
camp
where
about
ten
o
clock
she
was
graciously
delivered
of
a
daughter
and
was
remarkably
well
friday
this
morning
i
baptized
john
smead
s
child
he
called
its
name
the
french
made
a
litter
of
poles
spread
over
it
a
and
a
on
which
they
placed
the
mother
and
child
and
so
carried
them
forward
three
days
after
there
was
a
heavy
rain
and
the
mother
was
completely
drenched
but
suffered
no
harm
though
miriam
the
wife
of
moses
scott
hereby
catched
a
grievous
john
perry
was
relieved
of
his
pack
so
that
he
might
help
his
wife
and
carry
her
when
her
strength
failed
several
horses
were
found
at
the
farms
along
the
way
and
the
sick
benjamin
simons
and
the
wounded
john
aldrich
were
allowed
to
use
two
of
them
rarely
indeed
in
these
dismal
were
prisoners
treated
so
humanely
and
the
credit
seems
chiefly
due
to
the
efforts
of
rigaud
and
his
officers
the
hardships
of
the
march
were
shared
by
the
victors
some
of
whom
were
sorely
wounded
and
four
indians
died
within
a
few
days
i
divided
my
army
between
the
two
sides
of
the
kaskékouké
hoosac
says
rigaud
and
ordered
them
to
do
what
i
had
not
permitted
to
be
done
before
we
reached
fort
massachusetts
every
house
was
set
on
fire
and
numbers
of
domestic
animals
of
all
sorts
were
killed
french
and
indians
vied
with
each
other
in
pillage
and
i
made
them
enter
the
valleys
of
all
the
little
streams
that
flow
into
the
kaskékouké
and
lay
waste
everything
there
wherever
we
went
we
made
the
same
havoc
laid
waste
both
sides
of
the
river
through
twelve
leagues
of
fertile
country
burned
houses
barns
stables
and
even
a
in
all
above
two
hundred
establishments
killed
all
the
cattle
and
ruined
all
the
crops
such
monseigneur
was
the
damage
i
did
our
enemies
during
the
eight
or
nine
days
i
was
in
their
as
the
dutch
settlers
had
escaped
there
was
no
resistance
the
french
and
their
allies
left
the
hoosac
at
the
point
where
they
had
reached
it
and
retraced
their
steps
northward
through
the
forest
where
there
was
an
old
indian
trail
recrossing
the
batten
kill
or
river
of
saratoga
and
some
branches
of
wood
creek
they
reached
the
place
where
they
had
left
their
canoes
and
found
them
safe
rigaud
says
i
gave
leave
to
the
indians
at
their
request
to
continue
their
fighting
and
ravaging
in
small
parties
towards
albany
schenectady
deerfield
saratoga
or
wherever
they
pleased
and
i
even
gave
them
a
few
officers
and
cadets
to
lead
these
small
ventures
were
more
or
less
successful
and
produced
in
due
time
a
good
return
of
scalps
the
main
body
now
afloat
again
sailed
and
paddled
northward
till
they
reached
crown
point
rigaud
rejoiced
at
finding
a
haven
of
refuge
for
his
wounded
arm
was
greatly
inflamed
and
it
was
time
i
should
reach
a
place
of
he
and
his
men
encamped
by
the
fort
and
remained
there
for
some
time
an
epidemic
apparently
like
that
at
fort
massachusetts
had
broken
out
among
them
and
great
numbers
were
seriously
norton
was
lodged
in
a
french
house
on
the
east
side
of
the
lake
at
what
is
now
called
chimney
point
and
one
day
his
guardian
de
muy
either
thinking
to
impress
him
with
the
strength
of
the
place
or
with
an
amusing
confidence
in
the
minister
s
incapacity
for
making
inconvenient
military
observations
invited
him
to
visit
the
fort
he
accepted
the
invitation
crossed
over
with
the
courteous
officer
and
reports
the
ramparts
to
have
been
twenty
feet
thick
about
twenty
feet
high
and
mounted
with
above
twenty
cannon
the
octagonal
tower
which
overlooked
the
ramparts
and
answered
in
some
sort
to

and
armed
with
nine
or
ten
cannon
besides
a
great
number
of

kind
of
much
like
a
swivel
in
due
time
the
prisoners
reached
montreal
whence
they
were
sent
to
quebec
and
in
the
course
of
the
next
year
those
who
remained
alive
were
exchanged

news
came
that
the
chief
contending
powers
in
europe
had
come
to
terms
of
agreement
and
in
the
next
october
the
peace

was
signed
both
nations
were
tired
of
the
weary
and
barren
conflict
with
its
enormous
cost
and
its
vast
entail
of
debt
it
was
agreed
that
conquests
should
be
mutually
restored
the
chief
conquest
of
england
was
louisbourg
with
the
island
of
cape
breton
won
for
her
by
the
farmers
and
fishermen
of
new

when
the
preliminaries
of

were
under

louis
xv
had
demanded
the
restitution
of
the
lost
fortress
and
george
ii
is
said
to
have
replied
that
it
was
not
his
to
give
having
been
captured
by
the
people
of
boston
but
his
sense
of
justice
was
forced
to
yield
to
diplomatic
necessity
for
louisbourg
was
the
indispensable
price
of
peace
to
the
indignation
of
the
northern
provinces
it
was
restored
to
its
former
owners
the
british
ministers

presenté
en
par
bobé
prêtre
de
la
congregation
de
la
mission
à
archives
nationales
printed
l
année
dernier
je
presenté
un
memoire
concernant
les
prétensions
reciproques
de
la
grande
bretagne
et
de
la
france
par
raport
aux
colonies
des
deux
nations
dans
l
amerique
et
au
reglement
des
limites
des
dites
colonies
je
ne
repete
pas
ce
que
j
ay
dit
dans
ce
memoire
je
prie
seulement
que
l
on
pese
bien
tout
ce
que
j
y
dis
pour
aneantir
les
prétensions
des
anglois
et
pour
les
convaincre
s
ils
veullent
être
de
bonne
foy
qu
elles
sont
des
plus
mal
fondées
trés
exorbitantes
et
mêmes
injustes
qu
ayant
usurpé
sur
la
france
presque
tout
ce
qu
ils
possedent
en
amerique
ils
deveroient
luy
rendre
au
lieu
de
luy
demander
et
qu
ils
deveroient
estimer
comme
un
tres
grand
avantage
pour
eux
la
compensation
que
j
y
propose
pour
finir
cette
affaire
laqu
elle
sans
cette
compensation
renaitra
toujours
jusqu
a
ce
qu
enfin
la
france
soit
rentrée
en
paisible
possession
de
tout
ce
qui
luy
appartient
légitimement
et
dont
on
ne
l
a
depoüilleé
que
par
la
force
et
la
malheureuse
conjoncture
des
tems
qui
sans
doute
tôt
ou
tard
luy
seront
plus
favorables
il
est
surprenant
que
les
anglois
entendus
comme
ils
sont
par
raport
à
leurs
interests
ne
fassent
pas
attention
qu
il
leurs
est
infiniment
plus
avantageux
de
s
assurer
par
un
traité
raisonnable
la
tranquille
et
perpetuelle
possession
des
payis
ou
ils
etoient
établis
avant
la
paix
d
utrecht
que
de
vouloir
profiter
des
conjonctures
pour
oster
aux
françois
des
payis
qu
ils
ne
cederont
jamais
de
bon
coeur
et
dont
ils
se
rempareront
quand
ils
trouveront
l
occasion
favorable
pour
cela
se
persuadant
qu
il
leur
sera
alors
permis
de
reprendre
par
force
ce
que
par
force
on
leurs
à
pris
et
ce
qu
ils
ont
été
obligé
de
ceder
a
utrecht
et
meme
de
reprendre
au
moins
une
partie
des
payis
que
l
angleterre
à
usurpez
sur
la
france
qui
ne
les
à
jamais
cedez
par
aucun
traité
que
je
scache
jean
verazan
par
ordre
de
françois
er
fit
la
decouverte
de
tous
les
payis
et
costes
qui
sont
entre
le
et
le
degre
de
latitude
et
y
fit
deux
voyages
dont
le
dernier
fut
en
et
par
ordre
et
au
nom
du
dit
roy
francois
er
il
prit
possession
de
toute
cette
coste
et
de
tous
ces
payis
bien
long
tems
avant
que
les
anglois
y
eussent
eté
l
an
les
françois
s
établirent
dans
la
caroline
champlain
à
la
fin
de
la
relation
de
ses
voyages
fait
un
chapitre
exprez
dans
lequel
il
prouve
que
la
france
a
pris
possession
de
toutes
les
costes
et
payis
depuis
la
floride
inclusivement
jusqu
au
fleuve
laurent
avant
tout
autre
prince
chrêtien
que
nos
roys
ont
eu
dez
le
commancement
des
decouvertes
des
lieutenans
generaux
dans
ces
payis
et
costes
que
les
françois
les
ont
habitez
avant
les
anglois
que
les
prétensions
des
anglois
sont
mal
fondées
la
lecture
de
ce
chapitre
fait
voir
que
champlain
prouve
invinciblement
tous
ces
chefs
et
de
maniere
que
les
anglois
n
ont
rien
de
bon
à
y
repondre
de
sorte
que
s
ils
veullent
être
de
bonne
foy
ils
doivent
convenir
que
tous
ces
payis
appartiennent
légitimement
à
la
france
qu
ils
s
en
sont
emparez
et
qu
ils
les
retiennent
contre
toute
justice
il
est
a
remarquer
que
quoyque
par
le
traité
de
germain
l
angleterre
dut
restituer
tout
ce
qu
elle
avoit
occupé
dans
la
nouvelle
france
et
par
consequent
toute
la
coste
depuis
baston
jusqu
a
la
virginie
inclusivement
car
alors
les
anglois
ne
s
etoient
pas
encore
emparez
de
la
caroline
laqu
elle
coste
est
certainement
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
les
anglois
ne
l
ont
pas
cependant
restituée
et
la
gardent
encore
a
present
contre
la
teneur
du
traité
de
germain
quoy
que
la
france
ne
l
ait
point
cedée
a
l
angleterre
ni
par
le
dit
traité
ni
par
aucun
autre
que
je
scache
cecy
merite
la
plus
serieuse
attention
de
la
france
et
qu
elle
fasse
entendre
serieusement
aux
anglois
que
par
le
traité
de
germain
ils
se
sont
obligez
de
luy
rendre
toutte
cette
coste
qui
incontestablement
est
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
comme
je
l
ay
prouvé
cy
devant
et
encore
plus
au
long
dans
mon
memoire
et
comme
le
prouvent
verazan
champlain
denis
et
toutes
les
plus
ancienes
cartes
de
l
amerique
septentrionale
or
le
commun
consentement
de
toute
l
europe
est
de
depeindre
la
nouvelle
france
s
étendant
au
moins
au
et
degrez
de
latitude
ainsy
qu
il
appert
par
les
imprimées
en
espagne
italie
hollande
flandres
allemagne
et
angleterre
même
sinon
depuis
que
les
anglois
se
sont
emparez
des
costes
de
la
nouvelle
france
ou
est
l
acadie
etechemains
l
almouchicois
et
la
grande
riviere
de
l
aurens
ou
ils
ont
imposé
a
leur
fantaisie
des
noms
de
nouvelle
angleterre
ecosse
et
autres
mais
il
est
mal
aisé
de
pouvoir
effacer
une
chose
qui
est
connué
de
toute
la
chretienteé
d
ou
je
conclus
quavant
l
usurpation
faite
par
les
anglois
toute
cette
coste
jusqu
au
degre
s
appelloit
nouvelle
france
laquelle
comprenoit
outre
plusieurs
autres
provinces
l
etechemains
l
almouchicois
et
l
acadie
les
anglois
doivent
remettre
à
la
france
le
port
royal
et
la
france
doit
insister
vigoureusement
sur
cette
restitution
et
ordonner
aux
françois
de
port
royal
des
mines
et
de
beaubassin
et
autres
lieux
de
reconaitre
sa
majesté
tres
chretiene
pour
leur
souverain
et
leur
deffendre
d
obeir
a
aucun
autre
de
plus
commander
a
tous
ces
lieux
et
payis
et
a
toute
la
partie
septentrionale
de
la
peninsule
ainsi
qu
aux
payis
des
almouchicois
et
des
etechemains
de
reconaitre
le
gouverneur
de
l
isle
royale
pour
leur
gouverneur
il
est
même
apropos
de
comprendre
dans
le
brevet
de
gouverneur
de
l
isle
royale
tous
ces
payis
jusqu
au
cap
cod
que
la
france
ne
doit
point
souffrir
que
les
anglois
s
etablissent
dans
les
payis
qu
elle
n
a
pas
cedez
qu
elle
doit
incessament
s
en
remettre
en
possession
y
envoyer
quantite
d
habitans
et
s
y
fortifier
de
maniere
qu
on
puisse
arrêter
les
anglois
que
depuis
long
tems
tachent
de
s
emparer
de
l
amerique
francoise
dont
ils
conaissent
l
importance
et
dont
ils
feroient
un
meilleur
usage
que
celuy
que
les
françois
en
font
si
les
anglois
disent
que
les
payis
qui
sont
entre
les
rivieres
de
quinibequi
et
de
te
croix
font
partie
de
la
nouvelle
angleterre
je
leurs
repons
qu
ils
scavent
bien
le
contraire
que
ces
payis
ont
toujours
fait
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
que
les
francois
les
ont
toujours
possedez
et
habitez
que
de
castin
gentilhomme
francois
a
toujours
eu
et
a
encore
son
habitation
entre
la
riviere
de
quinibequi
et
celle
de
pentagoet
que
même
depuis
les
usurpations
des
anglois
et
leurs
etablissements
dans
leur
prétenduë
nouvelle
angleterre
les
francois
ont
toujours
prétendu
que
la
nouvelle
france
s
etend
qusqu
au
cap
cod
et
qu
il
en
est
fait
mention
dans
toutes
les
patentes
de
gouverneurs
francois
que
de
l
aveu
même
des
anglois
la
nouvelle
angleterre
a
une
tres
petite
etenduë
du
costé
de
l
est
il
est
facile
de
le
prouver
par
eux
mêmes
j
ay
lu
une
description
de
la
nouvelle
angleterre
et
des
autres
colonies
angloises
composée
par
un
anglois
traduite
en
francois
imprimée
à
paris
en
par
loüis
billaine
voicy
les
propres
termes
de
cet
autheur
anglois
la
nouvelle
angleterre
est
au
septentrion
de
marylande
au
raport
du
capitaine
smith
elle
a
prez
de
lieuës
de
coste
de
mer
ainsi
selon
les
anglois
qui
sont
de
bonne
foy
la
nouvelle
angleterre
qui
n
a
que
prez
de
lieuës
de
coste
de
mer
ne
scauroit
s
etendre
jusqu
e
á
la
riviere
de
quinebequi
c
est
tout
au
plus
si
elle
s
etend
jusqu
a
deux
ou
trois
lieuës
à
l
est
de
baston
il
semble
même
que
les
anglois
ont
basti
baston
et
en
ont
fait
une
ville
considerable
à
l
extremeté
de
leur
pretenduë
nouvelle
angleterre
pour
être
a
portée
et
en
etat
de
s
emparer
sur
les
francois
de
tout
ce
qui
est
à
l
est
de
baston
pour
être
en
etat
d
empecher
les
francois
de
s
etablir
sur
toute
cette
coste
jusqu
à
la
karoline
inclusivement
laquelle
coste
etant
de
notorieté
publique
de
la
nouvelle
france
à
eté
usurpez
sur
la
france
a
qui
elle
appartenoit
alors
et
luy
appartient
encore
ne
l
ayant
jamais
cedeé
c
est
ce
que
je
vais
prouver
apres
avoir
invinciblement
convaincu
les
anglois
que
tout
ce
qui
est
a
l
est
de
quinibequi
a
toujours
appartenu
et
appartient
encore
a
la
france
excepté
l
acadie
selon
ses
ancienes
limites
qu
elle
a
cedée
par
force
a
l
angleterre
par
la
paix
d
utrecht
il
faut
que
presentement
je
prouve
que
toute
la
coste
depuis
la
riviere
quinibequi
jusqu
à
la
caroline
inclusivement
appartient
par
toutes
sortes
de
droits
à
la
france
sur
qui
les
anglois
l
ont
usurpée
voicy
une
partie
de
mes
preuves
les
françois
ont
decouvert
tous
ces
payis
avant
les
anglois
et
en
ont
pris
possession
avant
eux
les
roys
de
france
ont
nommé
ces
payis
caroline
et
nouvelle
france
avant
que
les
anglois
leurs
eussent
donné
des
noms
à
leur
mode
pour
faire
oublier
les
noms
que
les
francois
leurs
avoient
imposez
et
que
ces
payis
appartenoient
à
la
france
les
roys
de
france
ont
donné
des
lettres
patentes
à
leurs
sujets
pour
posseder
et
habiter
ces
payis
avant
que
jacques
et
charles
roys
d
angleterre
en
eussent
donne
à
leurs
sujets
pour
convaincre
les
anglois
de
ces
veritées
il
faut
lire
avec
attention
ce
qu
en
ont
ecrit
jean
verazan
champlain
laet
denis
les
traitez
faits
entre
la
france
et
l
angleterre
et
le
memoire
que
j
ay
presenté
l
anneé
dernier
on
y
trouvera
tant
de
choses
lesquelles
il
seroit
trop
long
de
copier
icy
qui
prouvent
que
ces
payis
ont
toujours
appartenu
de
droit
a
la
france
et
que
les
anglois
s
en
sont
emparez
par
force
que
la
france
ne
les
a
jamais
cedez
à
l
angleterre
par
aucun
traité
que
je
scache
et
partant
que
la
france
conserve
toujours
son
droit
sur
tous
ces
payis
et
qu
elle
a
droit
de
les
redemander
à
l
angleterre
comme
elle
les
redemande
présentement
ou
bien
un
equivalent
l
equivalent
que
la
france
demande
et
dont
elle
veut
bien
se
contenter
c
est
la
restitution
de
tout
ce
qu
elle
a
cedéé
par
force
à
l
angleterre
par
le
traité
d
utrecht
il
est
de
l
honeur
et
de
l
interest
de
l
angleterre
d
accorder
à
la
france
cette
equivalent
parceque
n
y
ayant
point
d
honeur
à
profiter
des
malheurs
d
un
roy
pour
luy
faire
ceder
par
force
les
payis
qui
luy
appartiennent
il
est
de
l
honeur
de
l
angleterre
de
rendre
a
la
france
ce
qu
elle
a
eté
contrainte
de
luy
ceder
et
qu
elle
ne
possede
qu
a
ce
mauvais
tiltre
il
est
aussi
contre
la
justice
et
l
honeur
de
l
angleterre
de
posseder
sans
aucun
tiltre
et
contre
toute
justice
les
payis
qui
sont
depuis
la
riviere
de
quinibequi
jusqu
à
la
caroline
inclusivement
il
n
est
pas
moins
de
l
honeur
et
de
l
interest
de
l
angleterre
de
profiter
du
moyen
que
la
france
veut
bien
luy
presenter
pour
sassurer
a
perpetuite
toute
cette
coste
et
pour
la
posseder
par
la
cession
que
la
france
en
fera
et
de
tous
ses
droits
sur
ces
payis
moyennant
l
equivalent
proposé
parceque
l
angleterre
doit
craindre
que
la
france
dont
elle
ne
doit
mepriser
ni
le
ressentiment
ni
la
puissance
ne
trouve
une
conjoncture
favorable
pour
faire
valoir
ses
pretensions
et
ses
droits
et
pour
rentrer
en
possession
de
tout
ce
que
l
angleterre
luy
a
usurpée
et
de
tout
ce
qu
elle
l
a
obligé
par
force
de
luy
ceder
quand
on
veut
trop
avoir
souvent
on
n
a
rien
et
meme
on
perd
ce
que
l
on
avoit
il
est
donc
de
la
sagesse
et
de
l
interest
de
l
angleterre
de
ne
pas
pousser
trop
loin
ses
demandes
et
de
convenir
avec
la
france
de
sorte
qu
elle
puisse
posseder
avec
justice
et
tranquillement
des
payis
que
la
france
aura
toujours
droit
de
reprendre
jusqu
a
ce
qu
elle
en
ait
fait
une
cession
libre
et
volontaire
et
qu
il
paroisse
que
l
angleterre
en
faveur
de
cette
cession
luy
ait
donné
un
equivalent
la
france
s
offre
donc
pour
vivre
en
paix
avec
l
angleterre
de
luy
ceder
tous
ses
droits
sur
toute
la
coste
qui
est
entre
la
riviere
de
quinibequi
dans
la
nouvelle
france
jusqu
a
la
riviere
jourdain
dans
la
caroline
de
sorte
que
ces
deux
rivieres
servent
de
limites
aux
francois
et
aux
anglois
la
france
demande
pour
equivalent
de
la
cession
de
tant
de
payis
si
grands
si
beaux
et
si
a
sa
biensceance
que
l
angleterre
luy
rende
et
restituë
tout
ce
qu
elle
luy
à
cedé
par
le
traité
dutrecht
si
la
france
ne
peut
pas
engager
l
angleterre
à
convenir
de
cet
equivalent
elle
pouroit
mais
ce
ne
doit
être
qu
a
l
extremité
ceder
encore
à
l
angleterre
la
caroline
francoise
c
est
a
dire
ce
qui
est
au
sud
de
la
riviere
jourdain
ou
bien
ce
qui
est
entre
la
riviere
quinibequi
et
celle
de
pentagoet
ou
bien
leur
offrir
une
somme
d
argent
il
semble
que
l
angleterre
doive
estimer
comme
un
grand
avantage
pour
elle
que
la
france
veuille
bien
convenir
de
cet
equivalent
qui
assure
aux
anglois
et
leur
rend
legitime
la
possession
de
cette
grande
etenduë
de
costes
qu
ils
ont
usurpez
sur
la
france
qui
ne
les
a
jamais
cedez
qui
ne
les
cedera
jamais
et
sur
lesqu
elles
elle
conservera
toujours
ses
legitimes
droit
et
pretensions
jusqu
a
ce
qu
elle
les
ait
cédeés
a
l
angleterre
moyennant
un
equivalent
raisonnable
tel
qu
est
la
restitution
de
tout
ce
que
la
france
luy
a
cedé
par
force
a
utrecht
limites
suposeé
l
acceptation
de
cet
equivalent
par
l
une
et
l
autre
nation
la
france
toujours
genereuse
consentira
pour
vivre
en
paix
avec
les
anglois
qu
une
ligne
tirée
depuis
l
embouchure
de
la
riviere
de
quinibequi
ou
bien
depuis
l
embouchure
de
la
riviere
de

qui
ira
tout
droit
passer
á
egale
distance
entre
corlard
et
les
lacs
de
champlain
et
du
saint
sacrement
et
joindre
la
ligne
par
laqu
elle
le
sieur
de
l
isle
geographe
termine
les
terres
angloises
jusqu
a
la
riviere
jourdain
ou
bien
jusqu
à
la
caroline
la
france
consentira
que
cette
ligne
serve
de
borne
et
limites
aux
terres
des
deux
nations
de
sorte
que
tous
les
payis
et
terres
qui
sont

appartiendront
à
l
angleterre
et
que
tout
ce
qui
sera
au
dela
de
cette
ligne
appartiendra
a
la
france
dans
le
fond
il
est
avantageux
a
la

de
faire
incessament
regler
les
limites

pour
empecher

anglois
d
empieter
toujours
de

sous
pretexte
de
limites
non
regleés
que
parcequ
il
est
assuré
que
si
le
droit
de
la
france
est
bien
soutenu
le
réglement
lui
sera
avantageux
aussi
bien
que
l
equivalent
que
j
ay
proposé
mais
il
pouroit
arriver
que
les
anglois
qui
ont
demandé
le
reglement
des
limites
voyant
qu
il
ne
doit
pas
leur
etre
favorable
s
il
est
fait
selon
la
justice
pourroient
bien
eux
mêmes
l
eloigner
afin
de
pouvoir
toujours
empieter
sur
les
francois
sous
pretexte
de
limites
non
regleés
et
de
se
mettre
toujours
en
possession
des
payis
appartenans
à
la
france
en
ce
cas
et
aussi
au
cas
que
les
anglois
ne
veullent
pas
restituer
a
la
france
leur
nouvelle
angleterre
et
autres
payis
jusqu
a
la
caroline
inclusivement
qu
ils
luy
out
usurpez
ou
bien
leur
rendre
l
acadie
pour
l
equivalent
dont
j
ay
parlé
il
faut
que
la
france
mette
incessament
quantité
d
habitans
dans
le
payis
qui
est
entre
la
riviere
de
quinibequi
et
celle
de
te
croix
lequel
payis
qui
selon
les
anglois
n
est
point
en
litige
ni
partie
de
la
pretenduë
nouvelle
ecosse
même
selon
l
etenduë
imaginaire
que
luy
á
donnée
leur
roy
jacques
qui
ne
la
fait
commancer
qu
a
la
riviere
te
croix
et
celle
de
quinibequi
n
ayant
jamais
eté
cedé
ni
par
le
traite
d
utrecht
ni
par
aucun
autre
que
je
scache
et
ce
payis
ayant
toujours
appartenu
a
la
france
et
eté
par
elle
possedez
et
habité
de
castin
gentilhomme
francois
ayant
son
habitation
entre
la
riviere
de
pentagoet
et
celle
de
quinibequi
comme
je
l
ay
deja
dit
on
peut
même
faire
entendre
a
l
angleterre
que
le
roy
donnera
ce
payis
a
la
compagnie
des
indes
qui
scaura
bien
le
deffendre
et
le
faire
valoir
que
le
roy
donnera
aussi
a
la
compagnie
des
indes
la
caroline
francoise
comme
depandance
et
province
de
la
loüisiane
a
condition
qu
elle
y
mettera
des
habitans
et
y
fera
bâtir
de
bons
forts
et
une
bonne
citadelle
pour
soutenir
et
deffendre
ce
beau
payis
contre
les
anglois
il
est
certain
que
si
le
roy
fait
entendre
serieusement
qu
il
est
resolu
de
donner
à
la
compagnie
des
indes
non
seulement
la
caroline
francoise
et
le
payis
qui
est
entre
les
rivieres
de
quinibequi
et
de
te
croix
mais
aussi
de
luy
ceder
et
abandonner
tous
ses
droits
sur
tous
les
payis
que
les
anglois
ont
usurpez
sur
la
france
il
est
certain
dis
je
que
les
anglois
crainte
d
avoir
affaire
avec
une
compagnie
si
puissante
se
resoudront
au
reglement
des
limites
tel
que
je
l
ay
proposé
et
à
rendre
a
la
france
toute
la
nouvelle
ecosse
ou
acadie
selon
ses
ancienes
limites
enfin
tout
ce
que
la
france
leur
à
cedez
a
utrecht
moyennant
une
somme
d
argent
ou
bien
l
equivalent
que
j
ay
aussi
proposé
je
finis
ce
memoire
en
priant
de
faire
une
tres
serieuse
attention
aux
exorbitantes
prétensions
des
anglois
et
a
tout
ce
qu
ils
ont
fait
et
font
encore
pour
se
rendre
maitres
de
la
pesche
la
moluë
et
de
l
amerique
francoise
en
effet
il
est
tres
important
que
quand
on
traitera
du
reglement
des
limites
la
france
attaque
les
anglois
au
lieu
d
etre
sur
la
defensive
c
est
a
dire
qu
elle
doit
demander
aux
anglois
tout
ce
qu
ils
ont
usurpez
sur
elle
et
le
demander
vigoureusement
c
est
peut
être
le
meilleur
moyen
de
les
mettre
a
la
raison
il
est
même
apropos
qu
elle
les
presse
de
finir
cette
affaire
dont
sans
doute
la
conclusion
luy
sera
avantageuse
si
on
luy
rend
ii
demandes
de
la
france
du
ministère
des
affaires
pour
tous
les
raisons
deduites
cy
devant
la
france
demande
a
langleterre
qu
elle
laisse
jouir
tranquillement
la
france
de
tous
les
pays
qui
sont
a
l
est
de
la
riviere
quinibequi
ou
de
celle
de
georges
excepté
de
la
seulle
ville
de
port
royal
avec
sa
banlieüe
et
de
l
accadie
selon
ses
anciennes
limites
c
est
a
dire
la
partie
meridionale
de
la
peninsule
depuis
le
cap
fourchu
jusqua
camseau
exclusivement
que
la
france
a
cedée
par
la
traite
d
utrecht
tout
le
reste
qui
est
a
l
est
de
quinibequi
appartenant
a
la
france
en
tout
souveraineté
depuis
l
an
laquélle
ne
la
jamais
cedé
ny
par
le
traitté
d
utrecht
ny
par
aucun
autre
traitté
que
les
anglois
laissent
vivre
tranquillement
sous
la
domination
du
roy
les
nations
sauvages
qui
sont
dans
les
payis
a
l
est
de
quinibequi
et
qu
ils
ninquietent
point
les
missionnaires
qui
demeureront
chés
les
nations
ny
les
françois
qui
iront
chés
elles
que
les
anglois
restituent
a
la
france
ce
qu
ils
ont
occupé
a
l
est
de
quinibequi
et
qu
ils
ne
trouvent
pas
mauvais
que
les
françois
prennent
detruisent
ou
gardent
les
forts
postes
et
habitations
que
les
anglois
ont
etablis
ou
etabliront
dans
tous
les
pays
a
l
est
de
quinibiqui
ou
de
la
rivierre
georges
car
quand
même
il
ne
seroist
pas
sure
que
ces
paÿs
appartiennent
a
la
france
il
suffit
qu
ils
sont
contesté
pour
rendre
injuste
et
violente
l
occupation
qu
en
feroient
les
anglois
avant
que
la
contestation
fut
finie
que
les
anglois
restituent
tout
ce
qu
ils
occupent
dans
la
nouvelle
france
depuis
le
degré
jusqua
quinibequi
ou
jusqua
la
rivierre
georges
comme
elle
y
est
obligeé
par
le
traitté
de
germain
en
laye
en
la
france
ne
luy
ayant
jamais
cedé
par
aucun
traitté
aucune
partie
de
toute
la
nouvelle
france
sinon
la
ville
de
port
royal
avec
sa
banlieüe
et
lacadie
selon
ses
anciennes
limittes
si
les
anglois
disent
que
la
france
ne
s
est
point
opposeé
aux
occupations
qu
ils
ont
fait
dans
la
nouvelle
france
je
leur
repons
que
la
france
sy
est
toujours
opposeé
et
qu
elle
s
est
toujours
maintenuë
dans
la
souveraineté
de
toute
la
nouvelle
france
soit
en
donnant
tout
ses
paÿs
enconcession
soit
en
y
envoyant
des
gouverneurs
généraux
soit
en
nommant
vice
roys
de
la
nouvelle
france
les
plus
grands
seigneurs
du
roÿaume
tels
ont
esté
le
comte
de
soissons
le
prince
de
condé
de
montmorency
le
duc
de
vantadour
le
cardinal
de
richelieu
etc
qui
des
les
premiers
tems
ont
este
successivement
viceroys
de
la
nouvelle
france
et
terres
circonvoisines
par
la
lecture
de
leurs
patentes
on
verra
que
nos
roys
se
sont
toujours
conservé
la
souveraineté
des
pays
qui
sont
entre
le
et
le
degré
et
qu
ils
nont
jamais
consenty
que
les
anglois
y
fissent
aucun
etablissement
et
que
y
en
ont
fait
çá
esté
malgré
la
france
que
avoit
trop
d
affaires
en
europe
pour
pouvoir
les
empecher
se
reservant
toujours
ses
droits
et
la
volonté
de
les
faire
valoir
quand
elle
en
trouveroit
une
occasion
favorable
ce
qui
pourroit
bien
arriver
un
jour
alors
on
verroit
que
l
on
ne
s
empare
pas
impunement
et
par
violence
des
domaines
d
un
roy
de
france
et
qu
il
est
assés
puissant
pour
se
remettre
en
pocession
tost
ou
tard
de
ce
qu
on
a
usurpé
sur
luy
c
est
a
quoy
les
anglois
deveroient
faire
attention
et
ce
qui
devroit
les
obliger
de
ne
pas
mepriser
ny
maltraitter
la
france
comme
ils
font
la
france
s
est
encore
opposeé
aux
usurpations
des
anglois
les
ayant
obligé
par
le
traitté
de
germain
en
de
restituer
a
la
france
tout
ce
qu
ils
avoient
jusqual
ors
occupe
dans
la
nouvelle
france
ils
nont
pas
cependant
encore
fait
cette
restitution
mais
on
leur
demande
présentement
qu
ils
la
fassent
incessammant
n
etant
pas
juste
qu
ils
retiennent
plus
longtems
ce
qui
ne
leur
appartient
pas
et
qu
ils
ont
promis
solennellement
de
restituer
a
la
france
mais
disent
les
anglois
nous
sommes
etablis
dans
la
nouvelle
france
depuis
la
caroline
inclusivement
jusqua
quinibequi
depuis
jusqua
presant
nous
y
avons
mis
quantiteé
d
habitans
et
bastis
plusieurs
grandes
villes
navons
nous
pas
prescrit
contre
la
france
par
une
sy
longue
reponse
non
parce
que
la
france
sy
est
toujours
opposeé
par
les
lettres
pattentes
qu
elle
a
donneés
aux
concésionnaires
generaux
aux
lieutenants
generaux
et
aux
viceroys
de
la
nouvelle
france
non
parce
que
la
france
obligea
en
par
le
traitté
de
germain
langleterre
de
luy
restituer
tous
les
lieux
occupés
dans
la
nouvelle
france
par
les
anglois
et
que
le
traitté
de
breda
en
celuy
de
neutralité
en
et
celuy
d
utrecht
en
ne
disent
rien
d
ou
on
puisse
inferer
que
la
france
ait
cedé
a
langleterre
aucune
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
sinon
la
province
de
la
cadie
selon
ses
anciennes
limittes
et
la
seule
ville
de
port
royal
avec
ses
dépendances
ou
banlieüe
je
dis
encore
que
cette
longue
possession
des
anglois
ces
villes
baties
et
ce
grand
nombre
d
habitans
mis
par
eux
dans
ces
pays
nanéantissent
point
le
droit
de
la
france
pour
les
redemander
il
y
avoit
environ
ans
que
les
françois
avoient
abandonné
les
postes
qu
ils
avoient
alors
sur
la
coste
du
bresil
les
portuguais
sy
etablirent
aussitost
y
mirent
quantité
d
habitans
et
y
batirent
de
grandes
villes
ils
ne
croyoient
pas
cependant
que
pour
cela
la
france
fut
dechüe
de
ses
droits
de
proprieté
et
de
souveraineté
sur
ces
pays
abandonnés
par
elle
depuis
ans
puisqua
utrecht
en
le
roy
de
portugal
demanda
au
roy
qu
il
luy
abandonnat
ses
droits
sur
ces
pays
ce
qui
le
roy
fit
en
consideration
du
portugal
les
anglois
possedoient
depuis
longues
anneés
la
jamaique
y
avoient
quantité
d
habitans
de
forts
et
de
riches
villes
persuadés
cependant
que
les
droits
de
l
espagne
subsisteroient
tant
quelle
ny
auroit
pas
renoncé
en
leur
faveur
ils
demanderent
a
utrecht
cette
renonciation
au
roy
d
espagne
et
il
la
leur
accorda
si
les
anglois
avoient
demandé
a
la
france
une
cession
de
tous
ces
droits
sur
les
pays
occupés
par
eux
dans
la
nouvelle
france
il
y
a
apparance
que
le
roy
leur
auroit
fait
cession
a
des
conditions
raisonnables
ils
nont
pas
demandés
cette
cession
ou
sy
ils
lont
demandeé
elle
ne
leur
a
pas
esté
accordeé
les
droits
de
la
france
subsistent
donc
toujours
et
elle
pretend
presentement
que
les
anglois
qui
en
usent
sy
mal
avec
elle
luy
restituënt
tout
ce
quelle
a
usurpé
dans
la
nouvelle
france
depuis
le
jusquau
mais
disent
les
anglois
commant
pouvoir
restituer
un
sy
vaste
pays
ou
nous
avons
une
infinité
d
habitans
et
un
trés
grand
nombre
de
belles
et
riches
villes
une
telle
restitution
n
est
pas
response
javouë
qu
il
est
bien
difficile
de
sy
resoudre
même
aux
personnes
qui
font
profession
d
aimer
l
equité
et
la
justice
mais
le
roy
aime
trop
la
nation
angloise
a
trop
de
consideration
pour
elle
desire
trop
luy
faire
plaisir
et
est
trop
généreux
pour
exiger
d
elle
une
telle
restitution
voulant
luy
donner
un
exemple
de
la
moderation
dont
il
souhaite
que
langleterre
use
a
son
egard
il
se
désistera
volontiers
de
tous
ces
droits
et
consentira
que
toute
la
coste
jusqua
lieuës
dans
l
enfoncement
des
terres
depuis
le
degré
jusqua
la
rivierre
de
quinibequi
demeure
en
toute
proprieté
et
souveraineté
a
perpetuité
a
langleterre
a
condition
quelle
sobligera
par
un
traitté
solennel
et
décisif
de
ne
jamais
passer
ces
limites
que
la
france
ne
sera
jamais
inquieté
par
langleterre
dans
la
jouissance
en
proprieté
et
souveraineté
de
ce
qui
est
au
dela
de
ces
lieuës
dans
lenfoncement
des
terres
et
de
tous
les
pays
qui
sont
a
l
est
de
la
rivierre
de
quinibequi
qui
de
ce
costé
la
servira
de
limites
aux
deux
nations
et
que
langleterre
rendra
a
la
france
le
port
royal
et
la
cadie
avec
leurs
dependances
enfin
tout
ce
que
la
france
luy
a
cedé
par
le
traité
d
utrecht
sans
en
rien
excepter
cet
offre
du
roy
doit
estre
agreable
a
langleterre
et
luy
faire
plaisir
parceque
sy
elle
l
accepte
elle
possedera
a
juste
titre
cette
grande
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
qu
elle
possedera
toujours
injustement
sy
elle
naccepte
pas
un
offre
sy
raisonnable
que
luy
fait
le
roy
qui
sans
cette
acceptation
ne
renoncera
jamais
a
ses
droits
de
souveraineté
sur
une
sy
grande
et
sy
belle
partie
de
la
nouvelle
france
droits
que
les
anglois
doivent
craindre
qu
il
ne
fasse
valoir
tost
ou
tard
car
si
puissante
que
soit
langleterre
ils
ne
doivent
pas
croire
que
la
france
ne
luy
cede
rien
en
puissance
ny
en
quoy
que
ce
soit
et
qu
on
ne
la
meprise
et
maltraitte
pas
impunement
sy
les
anglois
ont
quelques
autres
titres
et
quelques
autres
raysons
a
alleguer
en
leur
faveur
sy
on
me
veut
faire
l
honneur
de
me
les
communiquer
je
moffre
d
y
repondre
d
une
maniere
a
les
obliger
d
avouër
qu
ils
ont
tort
sils
sont
de
bonne
foy
et
si
ils
aiment
la
justice
et
la
paix
addition
on
vient
de
me
faire
voire
une
carte
de
la
nouvelle
france
presenté
au
roy
par
les
anglois
sur
la
quelle
est
tracé
par
une
ligne
tout
ce
qu
ils
pretendent
en
vertu
du
traitté
d
utrecht
ils
y
etendent
sy
loin
leurs
pretentions
dans
les
terres
qu
il
y
a
tout
lieu
de
croire
que
cette
ligne
na
pas
eté
traceé
ny
cette
carte
presenteé
par
ordre
et
au
scû
du
sage
et
judicieux
ministre
dangleterre
mais
par
quelqu
un
que
donne
a
penser
qu
il
veut
broüiller
l
angleterre
avec
la
france
ce
qui
donne
encore
plus
de
lieu
a
avoir
de
luy
cette
penseé
c
est
que

le
mauvais
succès
dont
cette
entreprise
a

suivie
est
envisagé
avec
raison
comme
la

de

les
anglois
ne

auroient
point
inquietés
si
nous
n

été
les
premiers
à
les
insulter
notre
qualité
d
aggresseurs
nous
a
été
funeste
je
l
ai
oüi
conter
à
plus
d
un
ennemi
je
n
y
vois
que
trop
d
apparence
les
habitans
de
la
nouvelle
angleterre
étoient
interressés
à
vivre
en
paix
avec
nous
ils
l
eussent
sans
doute
fait
si
nous
ne
nous
étions
point
avisés
mal
à
propos
de
les
tirer
de
cette
sécurité
où
ils
etoient
à
notre
égard
ils
comptoient
que
de
part
d
autre
on
ne
prendroit
aucun
parti
dans
cette
cruelle
guerre
qui
a
mis
l
europe
en
feu
et
que
nous
nous
tiendrions
comme
eux
sur
la
seule
défensive
la
prudence
le
dictoit
mais
elle
n
est
pas
toujours
la
régle
des
actions
des
hommes
nous
l
avons
plus
éprouvé
que
qui
que
ce
soit
l
expédition
de
l
acadie
manquée
quoiqu
il
y
eût
tout
à
parier
qu
il
reuissiroit
par
le
peu
de
forces
que
les
ennemis
avoient
pour
nous
résister
leur
fit
faire
de
serieuses
réflexions
sur
notre
crainte
ou
notre
faiblesse
selon
tous
les
apparences
ils
en
conclurent
qu
ils
devoient
profiter
d
une
aussi
favorable
circonstance
puisque
ils
travaillerent
avec
ardeur
à
l
armement
qui
leur
était
necessaire
ils
ne
firent
pas
comme
nous
ils
se
prêterent
un
secours
mutuel
on
arma
dans
tous
leurs
ports
depuis
l
acadie
jusqu
au
bas
de
la
côte

dépêcha
en
angleterre
on
envoya
dit
on
jusqu

afin
d
en
tirer
tous
les
secours
qu
il
seroit
possible
cette
entreprise
fut
concertée
avec
prudence
et
l
on
travailla
tout
l
hiver
pour
être
prêt
au
premier
beau
tems
les
préparatifs
n
en
pouvaient
être
si
secrets
qu
il
n
en
transpirât
quelque
chose
nous
en
avions
été
informés
dès
les
premiers
instans
assez
à
tems
pour
en
pouvoir
donner
avis
à
la
cour
nous
eumes
tout
l
hiver
à
nous
c
était
plus
qu
il
n
en
falloit
pour
nous
mettre
en
état
de
défense
mais
la
terreur
s
étoit
emparée
des
esprits
on
tenait
des
conseils
dont
le
résultat
n
avoit
rien
que
de
bizarre
et
de
puérile
cependant
le
tems
s
écoulait
nous
perdions
de
précieux
momens
en
déliberations
inutiles
en
résolutions
presque
aussitôt
détruites
que
prises
quelques
ouvrages
demandoient
qu
on
les
parachevât
il
en
falloit
renforcer
augmenter
quelques
autres
pourvoir
à
des
postes
visiter
tous
ceux
de
l
isle
voir
où
la
descente
étoit
plus
facile
faire
le
denombrement
des
personnes
en
état
de
porter
les
armes
assigner
à
chacun
son
poste
enfin
se
donner
tous
les
soins
et
les
mouvemens
ordinaires
en
pareil
cas
rien
de
tout
cela
ne
se
faisoit
de
sorte
que
nous
avons
été
surpris
comme
si
l
ennemi
fût
venu
fondre
sur
nous
à
l
improviste
nous
aurions
eu
même
assez
de
tems
pour
nous
precautionner
mieux
qu
on
ne
l
a
fait
depuis
le
jour
où
nous
vimes
paroître
les
premiers
navires
qui
nous
ont
bloqués
car
ils
n
y
sont
venues
que
les
uns
après
les
autres
ainsi
que
je
le
dirai
dans
la
suite
la
négligence
la
déraison
avoient
conjuré
la
perte
de
notre
malheureuse
isle
ce
fut
le
quatorze
mars
que
nous
vimes
les
premiers
navires
ennemis
ils
n
étoient
encore
que
deux
nous
les
primes
d
abord
pour
des
vaisseaux
françois
mais
nous
fumes
bien
tôt
détrompés
par
leur
manœuvre
le
nombre
en
augmentoit
de
jour
à
autre
il
en
arriva
jusqu
à
la
fin
de
mai
ils
croiserent
sans
rien
tenter
le
général
étoit
devant
notre
isle
où
ils
arrivoient
de
tous
côtez
car
on
avoit
armé
à
l
acadie
plaisance
baston
dans
toute
l
amerique
anglaise
les
secours
d
europe
ne
vinrent
qu
en
juin
c
étoit
moins
une
entreprise
formée
par
la
nation
ou
par
le
roi
que
par
les
seuls
habitans
de
la
nouvelle
angleterre
ces
peuples
singuliers
ont
des
lois
une
police
qui
leur
sont
particulières
leur
gouverneur
tranche
du
souverain
cela
est
si
vrai
que
il
y
eût
guerre
déclarée
entre
les
deux
couronnes
il
nous
la
déclara
lui
de
son
chef
en
son
nom
comme
s
il
avoit
fallu
qu
il
eût
autorisé
son
maître
sa
declaration
portoit
qu
il
nous
déclaroit
la
guerre
pour
lui
pour
tous
ses
amis
alliés
il
entendoit
parler
apparemment
des
sauvages
qui
leur
sont
soumis
qu
on
appelle
que
l
on
distingue
des
sauvages
qui
obéissent
à
la
france
on
verra
que
l
amiral
n
avoit
rien
à
commander
aux
troupes
envoyées
par
le
gouverneur
de
baston
que
cet
amiral
n
a
été
que
spectateur
quoique
ce
soit
à
lui
que
nous
nous
soyons
rendus
il
nous
en
avoit
fait
solliciter
ce
qui
marque
bien
l
independance
qu
il
y
avoit
entre
l
armée
de
terre
celle
de
mer
que
l
on
nous
a
toujours
distinguées
comme
si
elles
eussent
été
de
differentes
nations
quelle
monarchie
s
est
jamais
gouvernée
de
la
sorte
la
plus
grande
partie
des
bâtimens
de
transport
étant
arrivés
dans
le
commencement
de
mai
nous
les
apperçûmes
le
onze
en
ordre
de
bataille
au
nombre
de
seize
venant
du
côté
de
canceaux
dirigeant
leur
route
vers
la
pointe
plate
de
la
baye
de
nous
ne
doutames
plus
qu
ils
n
y
fissent
leur
descente
c
est
alors
qu
on
vit
la
nécessité
des
precautions
que
nous
aurions
dû
prendre
on
y
envoya
à
la
hâte
un
détachement
de
cent
hommes
tirés
de
la
garnison
des
milices
sous
le
commandement
du
sieur
capitaine
de
port
mais
que
pouvait
un
aussi
faible
corps
contre
la
multitude
que
les
ennemis
debarquoient
cela
n
aboutit
qu
à
faire
tuer
une
partie
des
nôtres
le
sieur
trouva
déjà
près
de
deux
milles
hommes
débarqués
il
en
tua
se
retira
l
ennemi
s
empare
de
toute
la
campagne
un
détachement
s
avance
jusques
auprès
de
la
batterie
royale
pour
le
coup
la
frayeur
nous
saisit
tous
on
parla
dès
l
instant
d
abandonner
cette
magnifique
batterie
qui
auroit
été
notre
plus
grande
défense
si
l
on
eût
sçu
en
faire
usage
on
tint
tumultuairement
divers
conseils
il
seroit
bien
difficile
de
dire
les
raisons
qui
portoient
à
un
aussi
étrange
procédé
si
ce
n
est
une
terreur
panique
que
ne
nous
a
plus
quitté
de
tout
le
siège
il
n
y
avoit
pas
eu
encore
un
seul
coup
de
fusil
tiré
sur
cette
batterie
que
les
ennemis
ne
pouvoient
prendre
qu
en
faisant
leurs
approches
comme
pour
la
ville
l
assiégeant
pour
ainsi
dire
dans
les
régles
on
en
a
dit
sourdement
une
raison
sur
laquelle
je
ne
suis
point
en
état
de
décider
je
l
ai
pourtant
entendu
assurer
par
une
personne
qui
était
dans
la
batterie
mais
mon
poste
étant
en
ville
il
y
avoit
que
je
n
étois
allé
à
la
batterie
royale
c
est
que
ce
qui
détermina
à
un
abandon
si
criminel
est
qu
il
y
avoit
deux
brêches
qui
n
avoient
point
été
réparées
si
cela
est
le
crime
est
encore
plus
grand
parce
que
nous
avions
eu
plus
de
loisir
qu
il
n
en
falloit
pour
mettre
ordre
à
tout
quoiqu
il
en
soit
la
résolution
fut
prise
de
renoncer
à
ce
puissant
boulevard
malgré
les
représentations
de
quelques
gens
sages
qui
gémissoient
de
voir
commettre
une
si
lourde
faute
ils
ne
purent
se
faire
écouter
inutilement
que
ce
seroit
témoigner
notre
foiblesse
aux
ennemis
qui
ne
manqueroient
point
de
profiter
d
une
aussi
grande
étourderie
qui
tourneroient
cette
même
batterie
contre
nous
que
pour
faire
bonne
contenance
ne
point
réchauffer
le
courage
à
l
ennemi
en
lui
donnant
dès
le
premier
jour
une
si
grande
espérance
de
réussir
il
falloit
se
maintenir
dans
ce
poste
important
le
plus
que
l
on
pourroit
qu
il
étoit
évident
qu
on
s
y
conserveroit
plus
de
quinze
jours
que
ce
délai
pouvoit
être
employé
à
retirer
tous
les
canons
dans
la
ville
on
répondit
que
le
conseil
l
avoit
résolu
autrement
ainsi
donc
par
ordre
du
conseil
on
abandonna
le
sans
avoir
essuyé
le
moindre
feu
une
batterie
de
trente
pièces
de
canon
qui
avoit
couté
au
roi
des
sommes
immenses
cet
abandon
se
fit
avec
tant
de
précipitation
qu
on
ne
se
donna
pas
le
temps
d
encloüer
les
canons
de
la
manière
que
cela
se
pratique
aussi
les
ennemis
s
en
dès
le
lendemain
cependant
on
se
flatoit
du
contraire
je
fus
sur
le
point
de
gager
qu
ils
ne
tarderoient
guères
á
nous
en
battre
on
étoit
si
peu
à
soi
qu
avant
de
se
retirer
de
la
batterie
le
feu
prit
à
un
baril
de
poudre
qui
pensa
faire
sauter
plusieurs
personnes
brûla
la
robe
d
un
religieux
récolet
ce
n
étoit
pas
de
ce
moment
que
l
imprudence
caracterisoit
nos
actions
il
y
avoit
qu
elle
s
étoit
refugiée
parmi
nous
ce
que
j
avois
prévu
arriva
dès
le
quatorze
les
ennemis
nous
saluèrent
avec
nos
propres
canons
dont
ils
firent
un
feu
épouvantable
nous
leur
répondimes
de
dessus
les
murs
mais
nous
ne
pouvions
leur
rendre
le
mal
qu
ils
nous
faisoient
rasant
nos
maisons
foudroyant
tout
ce
qui
étoit
à
leur
portée
tandis
que
les
anglois
nous
chauffoient
de
la
batterie
royale
ils
établissoient
une
de
mortiers
sur
la
hauteur
de
rabasse
proche
le
barachois
du
côté
de
l
ouest
qui
tirerent
le
seize
jour
où
a
commencé
le
bombardement
ils
avoient
des
mortiers
dans
toutes
les
batteries
qu
ils
éleverent
les
bombes
nous
ont
beaucoup
incommodé
les
ennemis
paroissoient
avoir
envie
de
pousser
vigoureusement
le
siège
ils
établirent
une
batterie
auprès
de
la
plaine
de
qui
commença
à
tirer
le
travaillerent
encore
à
une
autre
pour
battre
directement
la
porte
dauphine
entre
les
maisons
du
nommé
roche
canonier
ils
ne
s
en
tinrent
point
à
ces
batteries
quoiqu
elles
nous
battissent
en
brêche
mais
ils
en
dresserent
de
nouvelles
pour
soutenir
les
premières
la
plaine
marécageuse
du
bord
de
la
mer
à
la
pointe
blanche
les
incommodoit
fort
empêchoit
qu
ils
ne
poussassent
leurs
travaux
comme
ils
l
auroient
souhaité
pour
y
rémédier
ils
pratiquerent
divers
boyaux
afin
de
couper
cette
plaine
étant
venus
à
bout
de
la
dessécher
ils
y
firent
deux
batteries
qui
ne
tirerent
que
quelques
jours
après
il
y
en
avoit
une
au
dessus
de
l
habitation
de
composée
de
sept
pièces
de
canon
prises
en
partie
de
la
batterie
royale
de
la
pointe
plate
ou
s
etait
fait
le
débarquement
on
la
destinoit
à
miner
le
bastion
dauphin
ces
deux
dernières
batteries
ont
presque
rasé
la
porte
dauphine
le
nous
vîmes
paroître
un
navire
avec
pavillon
français
qui
cherchoit
à
donner
dans
le
port
il
fut
reconnu
pour
être
effectivement
de
notre
nation
afin
de
favoriser
son
entrée
nous
fimes
un
feu
continuel
sur
la
batterie
royale
les
anglais
ne
pouvant
resister
à
la
vivacité
de
notre
feu
qui
ne
discontinuoit
point
ne
purent
empêcher
ce
navire
d
entrer
qu
il
leur
eut
été
facile
sans
cela
de
couler
à
fond
ce
petit
refraichissement
nous
fit
plaisir
c
étoit
un
navire
basque
il
nous
en
étoit
venu
un
autre
dans
le
courant
d
avril
nous
n
eumes
pas
le
même
bonheur
pour
un
navire
de
granville
qui
se
présenta
aussi
pour
entrer
quelques
jours
après
mais
qui
ayant
été
poursuivi
fut
contraient
de
s
echouer
se
battit
celui
qui
le
commandoit
nomme
étoit
un
brave
homme
lequel
ne
se
rendit
qu
à
la
dernière
extrêmité
après
avoir
été
accablé
par
le
nombre
il
avoit
transporté
tous
les
canons
d
un
même
côté
en
fit
un
feu
si
terrible
que
les
ennemis
n
eurent
pas
bon
marché
de
lui
il
fallut
armer
presque
toutes
leurs
chaloupes
pour
le
prendre
nous
avons
sçu
de
ce
capitaine
qu
il
avoit
rencontré
que
c
étoit
de
ce
malheureux
vaisseau
qu
il
avoit
apris
que
l
isle
royale
étoit
bloquée
cette
circonstance
importe
au
récit
que
je
vais
faire
vous
êtes
persuadés
en
france
que
la
prise
de
ce
vaisseau
de
guerre
a
occasionné
la
notre
cela
est
vraie
en
quelque
sorte
mais
nous
eussions
pu
nous
soutenir
sans
lui
si
nous
n
avions
pas
entassé
fautes
sur
fautes
ainsi
que
vous
avez
dû
vous
en
aperçevoir
jusqu
à
présent
il
est
vrai
que
graces
à
nos
imprudences
lors
que
ce
puissant
secours
nous
arrivoit
nous
commencions
à
être
sans
espérance
s
il
fût
entré
comme
il
le
pouvoit
nous
serions
encore
dans
nos
biens
les
anglais
eussent
été
forcés
de
se
retirer
parut
le
ou
le
de
mai
à
environ
une
lieue
et
demie
de
distance
de
le
vent
était
pour
lors
par
conséquent
bon
pour
entrer
il
laissoit
la
flotte
anglaise
à
deux
lieues
demi
sous
le
vent
rien
ne
pouvoit
donc
l
empêcher
d
entrer
c
est
par
la
plus
grande
de
toutes
les
fatalités
qu
il
est
devenu
la
proye
de
nos
vainqueurs
témoins
de
sa
manœuvre
il
n
étoit
personne
de
nous
qui
ne
donnât
des
malédictions
à
une
manœuvre
si
mal
concertée
si
imprudente
le
vaisseau
commandé
par
la
au
lieu
de
suivre
sa
route
ou
d
envoyer
sa
chaloupe
à
terre
pour
prendre
langue
ainsi
que
le
requéroit
la
prudence
s
amusa
à
poursuivre
un
corsaire
monté
en
senault
qu
il
rencontra
malheureusement
sous
la
terre
ce
corsaire
que
commandoit
un
nommé
rous
manœuvre
d
une
autre
manière
que
le
vaisseau
français
il
se
battit
toujours
en
retraite
forçant
de
voiles
et
attirant
son
ennemi
vers
l
escadre
angloise
ce
qui
lui
réussit
car
le
vigilant
se
trouva
tellement
engagé
qu
il
ne
lui
fut
plus
possible
de
se
sauver
quand
on
eut
vu
le
danger
deux
frégates
l
attaquerent
d
abord
de
la
maisonfort
leur
répondit
par
un
feu
très
vif
qui
en
mit
une
hors
de
combat
elle
fut
démâtée
de
son
grand
mât
désemparée
de
toutes
les
manœuvres
et
contrainte
de
se
retirer
mais
il
vint
cinq
autres
frégates
qui
chaufferent
le
vigilant
de
toutes
parts
le
combat
que
nous
voyons
à
découvert
dura
depuis
cinq
heures
du
soir
jusqu
à
dix
enfin
il
fallut
céder
à
la
force
se
rendre
les
ennemis
ont
beaucoup
perdu
dans
ce
combat
le
commandant
français
eut
hommes
tués
ou
blessés
le
vaisseau
n
a
été
que
fort
peu
endommagé
on
doit
dire
à
la
gloire
de
de
la
maisonfort
qu
il
a
fait
preuve
d
une
extrême
valeur
dans
ce
combat
mais
il
auroit
mieux
valu
qu
il
eût
suivi
sa
destination
c
étoit
tout
ce
que
les
intérêts
du
roi
exigeoient
le
ministre
ne
l
envoyoit
pas
pour
donner
la
chasse
à
aucun
vaisseau
ennemi
chargé
de
munitions
de
guerre
de
bouche
son
vaisseau
étoit
uniquement
destiné
à
ravitailler
notre
malheureuse
place
qui
n
auroit
jamais
été
en
effet
emportée
si
nous
eussions
pû
recevoir
un
si
grand
secours
mais
nous
étions
des
victimes
dévouées
à
la
colère
du
ciel
qui
a
voulu
faire
servir
contre
nous
jusqu
à
nos
propres
forces
nous
avons
sçu
des
anglais
depuis
notre
reddition
qu
ils
commençoient
à
manquer
de
munitions
de
guerre
que
la
poudre
étoit
encore
plus
rare
dans
leur
armée
que
parmi
nous
ils
avoient
même
tenu
quelques
conseils
pour
lever
le
siége
la
poudre
trouvée
dans
le
vigilant
fit
bientôt
évanouir
cette
idée
nous
nous
apperçumes
que
leur
feu
avoit
depuis
beaucoup
augmenté
je
sçai
que
le
commandant
de
cet
infortuné
vaisseau
dira
pour
se
justifier
qu
il
étoit
important
pour
lui
d
enlever
le
corsaire
afin
de
se
régler
sur
les
nouvelles
qu
il
en
auroit
appris
mais
cela
ne
l
excuse
point
il
sçavoit
que
louisbourg
étoit
bloqué
c
en
étoit
assez
qu
besoin
d
en
sçavoir
davantage
s
il
craignoit
que
les
anglais
n
eussent
été
maîtres
de
la
place
il
étoit
aisé
de
s
en
instruire
en
envoyant
son
canot
ou
sa
chaloupe
sacrifiant
quelques
hommes
pour
sa
sûreté
la
batterie
royale
ne
devoit
point
l
inquiéter
nous
en
aurions
agi
comme
avec
le
navire
basque
dont
nous
facilitâmes
l
entrée
par
un
feu
excessif
la
perte
d
un
secours
si
considerable
ralentit
le
courage
de
ceux
qui
avoient
le
plus
conservé
de
fermeté
il
n
étoit
pas
difficile
de
juger
que
nous
serions
contraints
d
implorer
la
clémence
des
anglais
plusieurs
personnes
furent
d
avis
qu
il
falloit
demander
à
capituler
nous
avons
cependant
tenu
un
mois
c
est
plus
qu
on
n
auroit
pu
exiger
dans
l
abbatement
où
venoit
de
nous
jetter
un
si
triste
spectacle
l
ennemi
s
occupa
à
nous
canoner
à
nous
bombarder
toute
le
reste
du
mois
sans
faire
des
progrès
bien
sensibles
qui
lui
pussent
donner
de
l
espoir
comme
il
ne
nous
attaquoit
point
dans
les
formes
qu
il
n
avoit
pratiqué
aucuns
retranchemens
pour
se
couvrir
il
n
osoit
s
aprocher
de
trop
près
tous
nos
coups
portoient
au
lieu
que
la
plûpart
des
siens
étoient
perdus
aussi
ne
que
lorsque
nous
le
jugions
nécessaire
il
tiroit
lui
plus
de
cinq
à
six
cens
coups
de
canon
par
jour
contre
nous
vingt
à
la
vérité
le
peu
de
poudre
que
nous
avions
obligeoit
à
n
en
user
que
sobrement
la
mousqueterie
étoit
peu
d
usage
j
ai
oublié
de
dire
que
dès
les
premiers
jours
du
siége
les
ennemis
nous
avoient
fait
sommer
de
nous
rendre
mais
nous
répondîmes
selon
ce
que
le
devoir
nous
prescrivoit
l
officier
deputé
pour
nous
en
faire
la
proposition
voyant
que
nous
rejettions
ses
offres
proposa
de
faire
sortir
les
dames
avec
assurance
qu
elles
ne
seroient
point
insultées
et
qu
on
les
feroit
garder
dans
les
maisons
qui
subsistoient
encore
en
petit
nombre
car
l
ennemi
en
débarquant
avoit
presque
tout
brûlé
ou
détruit
dans
la
campagne
nous
remerçiâmes
cet
officier
parceque
nos
femmes
nos
enfans
étoient
sûrement
dans
les
logemens
que
nous
leur
avions
faits
on
avoit
mis
sur
les
casemates
de
longues
piéces
de
bois
placées
en
biais
qui
en
amortissant
le
coup
de
la
bombe
la
rejettent
empêchent
l
effet
de
son
poids
c
est
là
dessous
que
nous
les
avions
enterrés
au
commencement
de
juin
les
assiégeans
parurent
reprendre
une
nouvelle
vigueur
n
étant
pas
contens
du
peu
de
succès
qu
ils
avoient
eu
ils
s
attacherent
à
d
autres
entreprises
voulurent
essayer
de
nous
attaquer
par
le
côté
de
la
mer
pour
réussir
ils
tenterent
de
nous
surprendre
la
batterie
de
l
entrée
un
détachement
d
environ
cinq
cens
hommes
s
y
étant
transporté
pendant
la
nuit
du
six
au
sept
fut
taillé
en
pièces
par
le
sieur
capitaine
de
compagnie
qui
y
commandoit
qui
tira
sur
eux
à
mitraille
plus
de
trois
cens
resterent
sur
la
place
il
n
y
eut
de
sauvés
que
ceux
qui
demandoient
quartier
les
blessés
furent
transférés
dans
nos
hôpitaux
nous
fîmes
en
cette
occasion
cent
prisonniers
n
eûmes
que
trois
hommes
de
tués
ou
blessés
mais
nous
perdîmes
un
canonier
qui
fut
fort
regretté
pour
sur
croit
d
infortune
il
arrive
aux
anglois
le
une
escadre
de
six
vaisseaux
de
guerre
venant
de
londres
ces
vaisseaux
croiserent
devant
la
ville
avec
les
frégattes
sans
tirer
un
seul
coup
mais
nous
avons
sçu
depuis
que
si
nous
eussions
tarder
à
capituler
tous
les
vaisseaux
se
seroient
embossés
et
nous
auroient
fait
essuyer
le
feu
le
plus
vif
leurs
dispositions
n
ont
point
été
ignorée
je
rapporterai
l
ordre
qu
ils
dévoient
tenir
les
ennemis
ne
s
étoient
encore
point
avisés
de
tirer
à
boulets
rouges
ils
le
firent
le
le
avec
un
succès
qui
auroit
eté
plus
grand
sans
le
prompt
secours
qui
y
fut
apporté
le
feu
prit
à
trois
ou
quatre
maisons
mais
on
l
eut
bientôt
éteint
la
promptitude
en
ces
sortes
d
occasions
est
la
seul
ressource
que
l
on
puisse
avoir
l
arrivée
de
l
escadre
étoit
sans
doute
l
objet
de
ce
nouveau
salut
de
la
part
de
l
armée
de
terre
son
général
qui
vouloit
avoir
l
honneur
de
notre
conquête
étant
bien
aisé
de
nous
forcer
à
nous
soumettre
avant
que
l
escadre
se
fût
mise
en
devoir
de
nous
y
contraindre
l
amiral
de
son
côté
songeoit
à
se
procurer
l
honneur
de
nous
reduire
un
officier
vint
pour
cet
effet
le
nous
proposer
de
sa
part
que
si
nous
avions
à
nous
rendre
il
seroit
plus
convenable
de
le
faire
à
lui
qui
auroit
des
égards
que
nous
ne
trouverions
peut
être
pas
dans
le
commandant
de
terre
tout
cela
marquoit
peu
d
intelligence
entre
les
deux
généraux
verifie
assés
la
remarque
que
j
ai
faite
on
n
eût
jamais
dit
en
effet
que
ces
troupes
fussent
de
la
même
nation
sous
l
obéissance
du
même
prince
les
anglais
sont
les
seuls
peuples
capables
de
ces
bizarreries
qui
font
cependant
partie
de
cette
précieuse
liberté
dont
ils
se
montrent
si
jaloux
nous
répondîmes
à
l
officier
par
qui
l
amiral
warren
nous
avoit
fait
donner
cet
avis
que
nous
n
avions
point
de
réponse
à
lui
faire
que
quand
nous
en
serions
à
cette
extrémité
nous
verrions
le
parti
qu
il
conviendroit
d
embrasser
cette
fanfaronade
eût
fait
rire
quiconque
auroit
été
témoin
de
notre
embarras
en
particulier
il
ne
pouvoit
être
plus
grand
cet
officier
dût
s
en
apperçevoir
malgré
la
bonne
contenance
que
nous
affections
il
est
difficile
que
le
visage
ne
décéle
les
mouvements
du
cœur
les
conseils
étoient
plus
frequens
que
jamais
mais
non
plus
salutaires
on
s
assembloit
sans
trop
sçavoir
pourquoi
aussi
ne
que
résoudre
j
ai
souvent
ri
de
ces
assemblées
où
il
ne
se
passoit
rien
que
de
ridicule
qui
n
annonçat
le
trouble
l
indécision
le
soin
de
notre
défense
n
étoit
plus
ce
qui
occupoit
si
les
anglois
eussent
sçu
profiter
de
notre
épouvante
il
y
auroit
eu
longtems
qu
ils
nous
auroient
emportés
l
épée
en
main
mais
il
faut
convenir
à
leur
louange
qu
ils
avoient
autant
de
peur
que
nous
cela
m
a
plusieurs
fois
rappellé
la
fable
du
liévre
des
grenouilles
le
but
de
nos
frequens
conseils
étoit
de
dresser
des
articles
de
capitulation
on
y
employa
jusqu
au
vingt
sept
que
le
sieur
lopinot
officier
sortit
pour
les
porter
au
commandant
de
terre
l
on
se
flatoit
de
les
lui
faire
mieux
goûter
qu
à
l
amiral
mais
ils
étoient
si
extraordinaires
que
malgré
l
envie
que
ce
général
avoit
de
nous
voir
rendre
à
lui
il
se
donna
à
peine
la
patience
de
les
écouter
je
me
souviens
que
nous
demandions
par
un
article
cinq
piéces
de
canon
deux
mortiers
de
fonte
de
pareilles
propositions
ne
quadroient
guéres
avec
notre
situation
afin
de
réussir
d
un
côté
ou
d
autre
on
envoya
proposer
les
mêmes
conditions
à
l
amiral
cette
négociation
avoit
été
confiée
au
sieur
capitaine
de
compagnie
qui
s
intrigua
beaucoup
auprès
de
warren
qui
quoique
la
plûpart
de
nos
articles
fussent
rejettez
en
obtint
pourtant
d
assés
honorables
on
arrêta
donc
la
capitulation
telle
que
les
nouvelles
publiques
l
ont
raportée
elle
nous
fut
annoncée
par
deux
coups
de
canon
tirés
à
bord
de
l
amiral
ainsi
qu
on
en
avoit
donné
l
ordre
au
sieur
a
cette
nouvelle
nous
reprimes
un
peu
de
tranquillité
car
nous
avions
sujet
d
apprehender
le
sort
le
plus
triste
nous
craignons
à
tout
moment
que
les
ennemis
sortant
de
leur
aveuglement
ne
se
présentassent
pour
nous
enlever
d
assaut
tout
les
y
convioit
il
y
avoit
deux
bréches
de
la
longueur
d
environ
cinquante
pieds
chacune
l
une
à
la
porte
dauphine
l
autre
à
l
eperon
qui
est
ils
nous
ont
dit
depuis
que
la
resolution
en
avoit
été
prise
l
exécution
renvoyée
au
lendemain
les
navires
devoient
les
favoriser
s
embosser
de
la
maniere
suivante
quatre
vaisseaux
quatre
frégattes
étoient
destinés
pour
le
bastion
dauphin
un
egal
nombre
de
vaisseaux
de
frégattes
parmi
lesquels
étoit
le
vigilant
devoit
attaquer
la
piéce
de
la
grave
trois
autres
vaisseaux
autant
de
frégattes
avoient
ordre
de
s
attacher
à
l
isle
de
l
entree
nous
n
eussions
jamais
pû
repondre
au
feu
de
tous
ces
vaisseaux
défendre
en
même
tems
nos
brêches
de
façon
qu
il
auroit
fallu
succomber
quelques
efforts
que
nous
eussions
pû
faire
nous
voir
réduits
à
recourir
à
la
clémence
d
un
vainqueur
de
la
générosité
duquel
il
y
avoit
à
se
défier
l
armée
de
terre
n
étoit
composée
que
de
gens
ramassés
sans
subordination
ni
discipline
qui
nous
auroit
fait
éprouver
tout
ce
que
l
insolence
la
rage
ont
de
plus
furieux
la
capitulation
n
a
point
empêché
qu
ils
ne
nous
ayent
bien
fait
du
mal
c
est
donc
par
une
protection
visible
de
la
providence
que
nous
avons
prévenu
une
journée
qui
nous
auroit
été
si
funeste
ce
qui
nous
y
a
le
plus
déterminé
est
le
peu
de
poudre
qui
nous
restoit
je
puis
assurer
que
nous
n
en
avions
pas
pour
faire
trois
décharges
c
est
ici
le
point
critique
sur
lequel
on
cherche
le
plus
à
en
imposer
au
public
mal
instruit
on
voudroit
lui
persuader
qu
il
nous
en
restoit
encore
vingt
milliers
fausseté
insigne
je
n
ai
aucune
interêt
à
déguiser
la
vérité
on
doit
d
autant
plus
m
en
croire
que
je
ne
prétends
pas
justifier
entierement
nos
officiers
s
ils
n
ont
pas
capitulé
trop
tôt
ils
avoient
commis
assez
d
autres
fautes
pour
ne
les
pas
laver
du
blâme
qu
ils
ont
encouru
il
est
constant
que
nous
n
avions
plus
que
barils
de
poudre
à
cent
livres
chacun
voilà
ce
qui
est
veritable
non
pas
tout
ce
qu
on
raconte
de
contraire
nous
n
en
trouvions
même
d
abord
que
mais
les
recherches
qu
on
fit
nous
en
procurerent
deux
autres
cachés
apparemment
par
les
canoniers
qu
on
sçait
être
partout
accoutumés
à
ce
ii
lettre
de
monsieur
du
chambon
au
ministre
à
rochefort
le
septembre
de
la
monseigneur
j
ai
l
honneur
de
vous
rendre
compte
de
l
attaque
et
reddition
de
louisbourg
ainsy
que
vous
me
l
avez
ordonné
par
votre
lettre
du
de
ce
mois
nous
eûmes
connaissance
d
un
battiment
le
quatorze
mars
dernier
parmy
les
glaces
qui
étaient
détachées
du
golfe
ce
battiment
parut
à
ou
lieues
devant
le
port
et
drivait
vers
la
partie
du
et
il
nous
disparut
l
le
du
nous
vîmes
encore
en
dehors
les
glaces
un
senaux
qui
couroit
le
long
de
la
banquise
qui
était
etendue
depuis
escartary
jusques
au
st
esprit
plusieurs
chasseurs
et
soldats
hivernant
dans
le
bois
m
informèrent
qu
ils
avaient
vu
les
uns
deux
battiments
qui
avoient
viré
de
bord
à
menadou
et
d
autres
qu
ils
avoient
entendu
du
canon
du
côté
du
st
esprit
ce
qui
fit
que
j
ordonnai
aux
habitans
des
ports
de
l
isle
qui
étaient
à
portée
de
la
ville
de
se
renger
aux
signaux
qui
leur
seroient
faits
je
fis
en
outre
rassembler
les
habitans
de
la
ville
et
port
de
louisbourg
je
formai
de
ceux
de
la
ville
quatre
compagnies
et
je
donnai
ordre
à
ceux
du
port
de
se
renger
à
la
batterie
royale
et
à
celle
de
l
isle
de
l
entrée
au
signaux
que
je
leur
fit
donner
le
avril
nous
aperçûmes
à
l
éclaircy
de
la
brume
et
parmi
les
glaces
vers
la
pointe
blanche
quatre
battimens
le
premier
ayant
tiré
quelques
coups
de
canon
l
islot
lui
répondit
d
un
coup
et
le
battiment
l
ayant
rendu
sur
le
champ
cela
nous
confirma
dans
l
idée
que
c
étoient
des
françois
qui
cherchoient
à
forcer
les
glaces
pour
entrer
dans
le
port
d
ailleurs
ils
profitoient
des
éclaircis
pour
s
y
enfourner
vers
le
port
et
cela
nous
assuroit
pour
ainsi
dire
que
ce
n
étoit
pas
des
corsaires
mais
bien
des
françois
etant
dans
le
doute
si
c
étoit
des
basttiments
françois
ou
anglois
j
envoyai
ordre
à
monsieur
benoit
officier
commandant
au
port
toulouse
de
dettacher
quelqu
un
de
confiance
à
canceau
pour
apprendre
s
il
y
avoit
des
basttiments
et
si
on
y
travailloit
ou
s
il
y
avoit
apparance
de
quelque
entreprise
sur
l
isle
royale
monsieur
benoit
dettacha
le
nommé
jacob
coste
habitant
avec
un
soldat
de
la
garnison
et
un
sauvage
pour
faire
quelques
prisonniers
au
dit
lieu
ces
trois
envoyés
mirent
pied
à
terre
à
la
grande
terre
du
costé
de
canceau
ils
eurent
le
bonheur
de
faire
quatre
prisonniers
anglois
et
revenant
avec
eux
les
prisonniers
se
rendirent
maitres
de
nos
trois
françois
un
soir
qu
ils
étaient
endormis
et
nous
n
avons
pu
apprendre
aucune
nouvelle
ni
des
envoyés
ni
de
l
ennemy
je
fus
informé
le
par
deux
hommes
venus
par
terre
du
port
de
toulouse
qu
on
entendait
tirer
du
canon
à
canceau
et
qu
ils
travailloient
au
rétablissement
de
cette
isle
et
un
troisième
arrivé
le
soir
m
assura
avoir
été
témoin
d
un
grand
combat
sur
le
navire
qu
il
avoit
vu
venir
du
large
trois
vaisseaux
sur
quatre
qui
étoient
pour
lors
à
cette
coste
et
que
le
feu
ayant
commencé
après
la
jonction
de
ces
bastimens
il
avoit
duré
bien
avant
dans
la
nuit
ce
qui
nous
engageoit
à
nous
flatter
que
nous
avions
des
vaisseaux
sur
la
coste
le
du
nous
vîmes
sept
vaisseaux
parmy
les
glaces
dont
il
y
avoit
quatre
vaisseaux
deux
corvettes
et
un
brigantin
et
ils
se
sont
tenus
ce
jour
vers
les
isles
à
dion
sans
pavillon
ni
flamme
ces
battiments
continuèrent
à
se
faire
voir
pendant
quelques
jours
depuis
la
pointe
blanche
jusques
à
port
de
noue
sous
pavillon
blanc
et
les
glaces
s
étant
écartées
de
la
coste
nous
apperçûmes
le
mai
un
navire
qui
faisait
route
pour
le
port
il
y
entra
heureusement
ce
navire
venoit
de
st
jean
de
luz
commandé
par
le
sieur
janson
dufoure
il
nous
apprit
qu
il
avoit
été
poursuivi
la
veille
par
trois
vaisseaux
qu
une
frégatte
de
canons
l
avoit
joint
et
qu

un
combat
de
trois
volées
de

de

à
la
pointe
du
jour
nous
eûmes
connaissance
de
tous
les

dans
la
partie
du

qui
nous
occasionna
une
alerte
les

leur
étoient
destinés
ainsi
que
les
habitans
de
la
ville
et
du
port
le
même
jour
ces
vaisseaux
prirent
à
notre
vue
deux
caboteurs
frettés
par
le
roy

qui
venoient
du
port
de
toulouse
chargés
de
bois
de
corde
pour
le
chauffage
des

et
des

ils
prirent
aussy
une
chaloupe
qui
venoit
des

madame
chargée
de
gibier
comme
nous
doutions
toujours
si
ces
vaisseaux

françois
jusqu
à
ce
jour
les
glaces
empêchant
l
entrée
du
port
depuis
qu
ils
avoient
paru
ensemble
j
avois
eu
la
précaution
d
arrêter
conjointement
avec
monsieur
bigot
deux
battiments
pour
les
faire
partir
en
cas
de
nécessité
pour
la
france
pour
porter
les
nouvelles
à
sa
grandeur
de
la
situation
où
se
trouvoit
la

et
sitôt
que
nous
fûmes
confirmés
par
le
prise
de

caboteurs
que
c

des

anglois
et
qu
il
y
en
avoit
d
autres
à
canceau
au
rapport
des
équipages
qui
s
étoient
sauvés
nous
fîmes
partir
à
la
faveur
de
la
brume
et
de
la
nuit
obscure
du
mai
capitaine
subtil
avec
nos
lettres
pour
monseigneur
pour
lui
apprendre
l
état
de
la
colonie
avec
les
circonstances
de
vaisseaux
qui
bloquèrent
le
port
quand
à
l
autre
bâtiment
qui
avoit
été
fretté
nous
avons
été
obligé
de
la
faire
couler
après
la
descente
faite
par
l
ennemy
étant
impossible
de
la
faire
sortir
les
vaisseaux
ennemis
qui
étoient
au

se
servant
de

qu
ils
avoient
prise
chargée
de
gibier
pour
descendre
et
mettre
pied
à
terre
à
gabarrus
à
notre
vue
je
fis
partir
le
un
détachement
de
soldats
sous
le
commandement
du
sieur
de
lavallière
pour
aller
par
terre
à
gabarrus
et
un
autre
de
hommes
d
habitans
sous
le
commandement
du
sieur
daccarrette
dans
un
charroye
pour
s
emparer
de
cette

mais
ces
deux
détachements
ne
purent
joindre
cette
chaloupe
celui
de

y
resta
deux
jours
et
ne
rentra
en

que
le
onze
du
soir
et
celui

rentra
le
au

parurent
du

derrière
les

à
dion
les
vents
étant
de
la
partie
de
ces
battiments
s
approchoient
à
vue
d
œil
je
ne
doute
pas
que
ce
ne
fussent
des
bastiments
de
transport
je
fis
tirer
les
signaux
qui
avoient
été
ordonnés
plusieurs
habitans

pu
s

rendre
et
entr

la
campagne
étant
investie
de
l

et
même
plusieurs
ont
été
faits
prisonniers
voulant
se
rendre
en

je
fis
aussy
commander
un
détachement
pour
s
opposer
à
la
descente
de
l
ennemy
et
ce
détachement
au
nombre
de
hommes
et

le
surplus

partit
sous
le
commandement
de
monsieur
morpain
et
du

mesilac
il
se
transporta
de
la
pointe
blanche
â
l
endroit
où
l
ennemy
avoit
commencé
à
faire
sa
descente
il
le
fit
rembarquer
dans
les
voitures
mais
pendant
le
temps
qu
il
étoit
en
cet
endroit
à
repousser
l
ennemy
fit
faire
une
autre
descente
plus
considérable
de
troupes
de
débarquement
à
l
anse
de
la
cormorandière
entre
la
et
gabarrus
il
s
y
transporta
avec
ses

avoit
mis
pied
à
terre
et
s
étoit
emparé
des
lieux
les
plus
propres
qu
il
jugea
pour
sa
défense
cela
n
empêcha
pas
ce
détachement
d
aller
l
attaquer
mais
l
ennemy
étant
beaucoup
plus
supérieur
en
nombre
il
fut
contraint
de
se
retirer
dans
le
bois
nous
avons
eu
à
cette
occasion
ou
soldats
tués
ou
faits
prisonniers
ainsy
que
ou
habitans
ou
particuliers
du

desquels
fut
monsieur

l
ennemy
ayant
avancé
dans

se
fit
voir
en
grand
nombre
mais
sans
ordre
à
la
portée
du
canon
de
la
pointe
dauphine
et
du
bastion
du

les
montagnes

couvertes
de
monde
à
deux
heures
les
canons

barbette
tirèrent
sur
plusieurs
pelotons
qui
paroissoient
défiler
du

baye
nous
nous
aperçûmes
aussy
qu
ils
défiloient
en
quantité
le
long
du
bois
vers
la
batterie
royale
je
fis
fermer
les
portes
et
je
fis
pourvoir
sur

champ
à
la
sûreté
de
la
ville
et
placer
environ
hommes
qui

y
sont
trouvés
pour

sur
le
soir
monsieur
thiery
capitaine
de
compagnie
qui
commandoit
à
la
batterie
royale
m
écrivit
une
lettre
par
laquelle
il
me
marquoit
le
mauvois
état
de
son
poste
que
cela
pourroit
donner
de
grande
facilités
à
l
ennemy
s
il
s
en
emparoit
qu
il
croyoit
pour
le
bien
du
service
qu
il
seroit
à
propos
de
travailler
à
le
faire
sauter
après
avoir
encloué
les
canons
je
fis
à
cette
occasion
assembler
le
conseil
de
guerre
monsieur
verrier
ingénieur
en
chef
ayant
aussi
été
appelé
fit
son
rapport
que
cette
batterie
avoit
ses
épaulements
du
costé
de
la
terre
démolis
dès
l
année
dernière
que
les
chemins
couverts

de
trois
à
quatre
mille
homme
avec
hommes
qu
il
y
avoit
dedans
pour
la
défense
sur
ce
rapport
le
conseil
de
guerre
décida
unanimement
qu
il
convenoit
pour
la
sûreté
de
la
ville
manquant
de
monde
pour
la
défendre
de
l
abandonner
après
en
avoir
encloué
les
canons
et
enlevé
le
plus
de
munitions
de
guerre
et
de
bouche
qu
on
pourroit
je
ne
dois
pas
oublier
de
vous
informer
que
le
même
conseil
de
guerre
vouloit
faire
sauter
cette
batterie
mais
que
monsieur
verrier
s
y
étant
opposé
fortement
on
la
laissa
subsister
j
envoyai
l
ordre
en
conséquence
à
monsieur
thiery
pour
abandonner
la
dite

après
qu
il
auroit
encloué
les
canons
et

l
exception
de
tous
les
boulets
de
canon
et
bombes
qui
y
sont
restés
n
ayant
pas
pu
les
emporter
ayant
jugé
nécessaire
conjointement
avec
monsieur
bigot
de
faire
couler
tous
les
bastiments
qui
étoient
armés
dans
le
port
pour
empêcher
l
ennemy
de
s
en
emparer

commandai
le
le
sieur
verger

la
même
opération
au
fond
de
la
baye
et
retirer
l
huile
de
la
tour
de
la
lanterne
ce
qu
ils
exécutèrent
le
je
fis
sortir
toutes
les
compagnies
de
milice
avec
des
haches
et
des
engins
pour
démolir
les
maisons
qui
étoient
à
la

barruchois
et
pour
enlever

le
chauffage
de
la
garnison

en
ayant
pas
et
pour
faire
brûler
toutes
celles
qu
on
ne
pourroit
pas
démolir
afin
d
empêcher
l
ennemy
de
s
y
loger
je
fis
soutenir
ces
travailleurs
par
soldats
françois
et
suisses
commandé
par
monsieur
deganne
capitaine
et
rasser
officier
suisse
comme
ils
finissaient
et
qu
ils
étoient
au
moment
de
se
retirer
en
ville
il
parut
au
barruchois
et
dans
les
vallons
des
hauteurs
plusieurs
pelotons
de
l
armée
ennemie
il
y
eût
même
quelques
coups
de
fusils
de
tirés
par
ceux
qui
étoient
les
plus
près
nous
n
eûmes
personne
de
tué
ni
de
blessé
et
nos
gens
virent
tomber
deux
hommes
de
l
ennemy
l
ennemy
s
est
emparé
de
la
batterie
royale
le
et
le
lendemain
il
tira
sur
la
ville
plusieurs
coups
de
canon
de
deux
qu
il
avoit
désencloué
le
même
jour
l
ennemy
commença
aussi
à
nous
tirer
plusieurs
bombes
de
pouches
pesant
et
de
pouces
d
une
batterie
de
quatre
mortiers
qu
ils
avoient
estably
sur
la
hauteur
derrière
les
plaines
le
bastion
du
roy
cette
batterie
de
mortiers
n
a
pas
cessé
de
tirer
de
distance
en
distance
ainsi
que
douze
mortiers
à
grenades
royales
que
l
ennemy
y
avoit
placés
et
deux
autres
canons
qu
ils
ont
désencloués
à
la
batterie
royale
mais
ce
feu
n
a
fait
aucun
progrès
jusqu
au
et
n
a
tué
ni
blessé
personne
le
je
fis
partir
un
exprès
en
chaloupe
pour
porter
une
lettre
à
monsieur
marin
officier
de
canada
qui
commandoit
un
détachement
de
canadiens
et
des
sauvages
à
l
acadie
avec
ordre
de
partir
pour
se
rendre
en
toute
diligence
à
louisbourg
avec
son
détachement
c
étoit
une
course
de
à
jours
au
plus
s
il
avoit
été
aux
mines
ainsi
que
l
on
m
avoit
assuré
mais
ce
détachement
étoit
parti
pour
le
port
royal
lorsque
l
exprès
y
arriva
cet
exprès
fut
obligé
d
y
aller
il
lui
remit
la
lettre
dont
il
étoit
chargé
il
tint
conseil
plusieurs
de
son
party
ne
voulurent
pas
le
suivre
mais
lui
s
étant
mis
en
chemin
avec
ceux
de
bonne
volonté
qui
voulurent
le
suivre
il
eût
toutes
les
peines
imaginables
à
ce
qu
on
m
a
assuré
de
trouver
des
voitures
dans
toute
l
acadie
propres
pour
son
transport
ils
s
y
embarquèrent
environ
à
dans
un
bateau
de
tonneaux
et
dans
environ
une
centaine
de
canots
comme
ils
étoient
dans
la
baie
à
doubler
une
pointe
ils
furent
attaqués
par
un
bateau
corsaire
de
canons
et
autant
de
pierriers
cet
officier
soutint
l
attaque
avec
vigueur
et
dans
le
temps
qu
il
étoit
au
moment
d
aborder
le
corsaire
pour
l
enlever
un
autre
corsaire
de
la
même
force
vint
au
secours
de
son
camarade
ce
qui
obligea
le
dit
sieur
marin
d
abandonner
la
partie
et
de
faire
côte
cette
rencontre
lui
a
fait
perdre
plusieurs
jours
et
il
n
a
pu
se
rendre
sur
les
terres
de
l
isle
royale
qu
au
commencement
de
juillet
après
que
louisbourg
a
été
rendu
si
ce
détachement
s
étoit
rendu
quinze
ou
vingt
jours
avant
la
reddition
de
la
ville
je
suis
plus
que
persuadé
que
l
ennemy
auroit
été
contraint
de
lever
le
siège
de
terre
par
la
terreur
qu
il
avoit
de
ce
détachement
qu
il
pensoit
être
au
nombre
de
plus
de
je
dois
aussi
informer
sa
grandeur
que
ce
détachement
a
tué
et
pris
comme
il
se
retiroit
du
passage
de
fronsac
pour
aller
à
l
acadie
après
notre
départ
treize
hommes
d
un
corsaire
anglois
qui
étoit
à
leur
passage
pour
les
empêcher
de
passer
ces
hommes
ayant
été
avec
leurs
canots
pour
faire
de
l
eau
ils
sont
tombés
entre
les
mains
de
ceux
de
ce
détachement
le
messieurs
les
généraux
anglois
me
sommèrent
de
rendre
la
ville
forteresses
et
terres
en
dépendant
avec
l
artillerie
les
armes
et
les
munitions
de
guerre
qui
en
dépendent
sous
l
obéissance
de
la
grande
bretagne
en
conséquence
de
quoy
promettoient
de
traiter
humainement
tous
les
sujets
du
roy
mon
maître
qui
y
étoient
dedans
que
leurs
biens
leur
seroient
assurés
et
qu
ils
auraient
la
liberté
de
se
transporter
avec
leurs
effets
dans
quelque
partie
de
la
domination
du
roy
de
france
en
europe
qu
ils
jugeroit
à
propos
je
répondis
sur
le
champ
à
cette
sommation
que
le
roy
mon
maître
m
ayant
confié
la
défense
de
la
place
je
ne
pouvois
qu
après
la
plus
rigoureuse
attaque
écouter
une
semblable
proposition
et
que
je
n
avois
d
autre
réponse
à
faire
à
cette
demande
que
par
les
bouches
des
canons
l
ennemy
commença
à
établir
le
une
batterie
de
sept
pièces
de
canon
dans
les
plaines
et
derrière
un
petit
étang
la
face
du
bastion
du
roy
laquelle
batterie
n
a
pas
cessé
de
tirer
des
boulets
de
et
depuis
ce
jour
jusqu
à
la
reddition
de
la
place
sur
le
casernes
le
mur
du
bastion
du
roy
et
sur
la
ville
cette
batterie
étoit
monseigneur
la
plus
dangereuse
de
l
ennemy
pour
détruire
le
monde
tous
les
boulets
enfiloient
toutes
les
rues
jusqu
à
la
porte
maurepas
et
au
mur
crénelé
personne
ne
pouvoit
rester
dans
la
ville
soit
dans
les
maisons
ou
dans
les
rues
aussy
pour
éteindre
le
feu
de
l
ennemy
je
fis
établir
deux
pièces
de
canon
de
sur
le
cavalier
du
dit
bastion
du
roy
on
fit
pour
cet
effet
deux
coffres
en
planches
qu
on
remplit
de
fascines
et
de
terres
qui
formoient
deux
embrasures
par
le
moyen
desquelles
les
canonniers
et
ceux
qui
servirent
ces
canons
étoient
à
l
abry
du
feu
de
l
ennemy
je
fis
aussy
percer
en
même
temps
deux
embrasures
au
mur
du
parapet
de
la
face
droite
du
dit
bastion
on
y
mit
deux
autre
canons
de
ces
quatre
canons
ont
été
si
bien
servis
que
le
feu
de
l
ennemy
de
la
dite
batterie
de
la
plaine
a
été
éteint
puisqu
ils
ne
tiroient
lors
de
la
reddition
de
la
place
qu
un
canon
et
qu
ils
ont
eu
les
autres
démontés
à
la
dite
batterie
ainsy
que
ceux
de
nos
gens
qui
ont
été
voir
cette
batterie
après
la
reddition
de
la
place
m
en
ont
rendu
compte
le
matin
du
je
fis
assembler
messieurs
les
capitaines
des
compagnies
pour
prendre
un
party
s
il
convenoit
de
faire
des
sorties
sur
l
ennemy
il
fut
résolu
que
la
ville
étoit
entièrement
dénuée
de
monde
qu
il
étoit
préjudiciable
d
en
faire
qu
à
peine
on
pourroit
garder
les
remparts
avec
les
hommes
qu
il
y
avoit
dans
la
ville
y
compris
les
deux
cent
de
la
batterie
royale
je
fis
masquer
la
porte
dauphine
en
pierre
de
taille
fascines
et
terre
de
l
épaisseur
d
environ
pieds
ainsi
que
les
deux
corps
de
garde
qui
sont
joints
sans
cet
ouvrage
l
ennemy
auroit
pu
entrer
en
ville
dés
le
lendemain
qu
il
auroit
tiré
de
la
batterie
de
francœur
cette
porte
n

pas
plus
forte
que
celle
d
une
porte
cochère
les
murs
de
la
dite
porte
et
des
corps
de
garde
n
avoient
que
trois
pieds
ou
environ
d
épaisseur
la
dite
porte
n

pas
non
plus
flanquée
et
n
avoit
pour
toute
défense
que
quelques
créneaux
aux
corps
de
garde
desquels
on
ne
pouvoit
plus

depuis
environ
dix
ans
que
parmy

il

plusieurs
en

informé
les

établir
une

voudroient
entrer
sur
un
avis
aussy
important
et
l
ennemy
ayant
aboré
pavillon
à
la
tour
de

je
fis
faire
un
détachement
de
cinq
cent
jeunes
gens
du
pays
et
autres
de
la
milice
et
des
flibustiers
sous
les
ordres
du
sieur
de

pour
aller
voir
si
cela
étoit
vrai
tâcher
de
suprendre
l
ennemy
ou
empêcher
de
faire
leurs
travaux
en
cet
endroit
ce
dêtachement
partit
en
trois
chaloupes
le
may
avec
chacun
douze
jours
de
vivres
et
les
munitions
de
guerre
nécessaires
qui
leur
furent
fournies
des
magasins
du

il
mit
pied
à
terre
au
grand
lorembec
le
lendemain
faisant
son
approche
à
la
tour
il
fut
découvert
par
l
ennemy
qui
étoit
au
nombre
d
environ
ils
se
tirèrent
quelques
volées
de
mousqueterye
et
se
séparèrent
ce
détachement
ne
voyant
pas
son
avantage
et
plusieurs
ayant
lâché
le
pied
il
fut
contraint
de
se
retirer
dans
le
bois
pour
brûler
s
il
lui
étoit
possible
les
magasins
qu
il
y
avoit
on
l
avoit
assuré
que
cela
étoit
aisé
que
l
ennemy
dormoit
avec
sécurité
en
cet
endroit
koller
qui
étoit
second
du
dit
sieur
de
beaubassin
venant
de
pierre
par
terre
quelques
jours
auparavant
avait
été
dans
une
des
barraques
du
dit
camp
et
avoit
emporté
une
chaudière
sans
être
découvert
ce
détachement
étoit
à
un
demi
quart
de
lieue
à
l
habitation
du
dit
koller
il
avoit
envoyé
des
découvreurs
en
attendant
la
nuit
mais
ils
eurent
le
malheur
dêtre
découverts
par
une
douzaine
d
anglois
qui
se
trouvèrent
aux
environs
ce
qui
fit
que
l
ennemy
détacha
un
party
considérable
qui
fut
pour
les
attaquer
le
sieur
de
beaubassin
fut
encore
obligé
de
se
retirer
après
quelques
coups
tirés
de
part
et
d
autre
l
ennemy
depuis
lors
cherchoit
partout
ce
détachement
et
plusieurs
de
ayant
été
obligés
de
jeter
leurs
vivres
pour
se
sauver
ils
étoient
sans
vivres
pour
passer
leur
douze
jours
et
plusieurs
qui
étoient
des
havres
voisins
l
avoient
abandonné
et
s
étoient
retirés
chez
eux
il
se
trouvoit
par
conséquent
sans
vivres
et
trop
faibles
pour
résister
à
l
ennemy
il
fut
donc
obligé
d
aller
au
petit
lorembec
pour
prendre
des
chaloupes
afin
de
rentrer
dans
la
ville
il
se
trouva
en
ce
havre
environ
sauvages
de
la
colonie
qui
avoient
détruit
il
y
avoit
deux
ou
trois
jours
à
anglois
qu
ils
avoient
trouvés
qui
pillaient
ce
havre
comme
ils
étaient
à
même
d
embarquer
dans
les
chaloupes
il
leur
tomba
un
détachement
de
à
anglois
les
sauvages
se
joignèrent
à
ce
détachement
et
ces
deux
corps
faisaient
environ
hommes
qui
tinrent
pied
ferme
à
l
ennemy
le
feu
commença
de
part
et
d
autre
vers
les
deux
heures
et
dura
pendant
plus
de
quatre
les
anglois
avoient
même
été
repoussés
deux
fois
et
ils
auroient
été
défaits
si
dès
le
commencement
de
l
action
n
avoient
pas
envoyé
avertir
de
leurs
gens
qui
étoient
à
la
batterie
royale
et
à
la
tour
et
s
il
ne
leur
étoit
pas
venu
à
l
entrée
de
la
nuit
un
party
considérable
qui
commença
à
vouloir
l
entourer
notre
détachement
voyant
qu
il
n
y
avoit
pas
moyen
de
résister
et
manquant
de
munitions
plusieurs
ayant
tiré
jusqu
à
leur
dernier
coup
il
se
retira
dans
les
bois
l
ennemy
supérieur
comme
il
étoit
les
poursuivit
une
partie
de
la
nuit
notre
détachement
fut
contraint
de
se
retirer
à
miré
et
de
passer
la
rivière
nous
avons
eu
en
cette
occasion
deux
hommes
de
tués
et
environ
de
blessés
ou
prisonniers
monsieur
de
beaubassin
fut
du
nombre
des
blessés
il
reçut
une
balle
au
gras
de
la
jambre
et
après
une
heure
et
demie
de
combat
ne
pouvant
résister
à
sa
blessure
il
se
retira
le
sieur
koller
continua
le
combat
jusqu
à
la
fin
le
dit
sieur
de
beaubassin
s
étant
rendu
en
ville
quelques
jours
après
sixième
dans
une
pirogue
m
informa
de
ce
qui
s
étoit
passé
à
l
occasion
de
son
détachement
que
le
surplus
étoit
réfugié
à
miré
où
il
l
avait
laissé
sous
la
conduite
de
koller
qu
il
lui
manquoit
des
vivres
et
des
munitions
de
guerre
ainsy
qu
aux
sauvages
sur
ce
rapport
je
fis
partir
une
chaloupe
avec
quarts
de
farine
et
autres
vivres
et
des
munitions
tant
pour
ce
détachement
celui
de
monsieur
marin
que
j
attendois
tous
les
jours
que
pour
les
sauvages
on
trouva
koller
avec
ses
gens
monsieur
marin

étoit
pas
et
les
sauvages
s
étoient
retirés
à
leur
village
koller
rentra
en
ville
le
juin
en
chaloupe
avec
ceux
de
son
détachement
et
les
quelques
autres
qu
il
trouva
à
miré
il
eût
bien
de
la
peine
â
passer
la
nuit
parmy
bâtiments
de
l
ennemy
qui
croisoient
depuis
gabarrus
jusqu
à
escatary
nous
avons
appris
depuis
la
reddition
de
la
place
par
des
personnes
de
probité
que
l
ennemy
avoit
eu
au
moins
homme
de
tués
et
de
blessés
au
choc
du
petit
lorembec
les
canons
de
la
porte
dauphin
et
ceux
du
flanc
droit
du
bastion
du
roy
ne
joignant
pas
bien
la
batterie
que
l
ennemy
avoit
fait
sur
les
hauteurs
de
francœur
à
la
porte
dauphine
on
perça
trois
embrâsures
à
la
courtine
de
la
grave
pour
battre
à
revers
la
batterie
de
l
ennemy
de
la
hauteur
de
francœur
ces
trois
embrâsures
où
on
avoit
placé
du
canon
de
furent
ouvertes
les
mai
et
firent
un
effet
merveilleux
le
premier
jour
on
leur
démonta
un
de
leurs
canons
et
leurs
embrâsures
furent
toutes
labourées
cela
n
empêcha
pas
le
feu
continuel
de
l
ennemy
et
quant
à
la
batterie
ce
que
nous
défaisions
le
jour
ils
le
refaisoit
la
nuit
le
même
jour
sur
les
trois
heurs
nous
eûmes
connoissance
d
un
gros
vaisseau
qui
donnoit
chasse
à
un
senau
et
ensuite
qui
se
battoit
avec
le

tems
trois

vers
le
cap
noir
et
la
pointe
blanche
courrurent
dessus
le
gros
vaisseau
après
s
être
battu
longtems
prit
la
chasse
sans
doute
quand
il
eut
connoissance
des
trois
qui
courroient
sur
lui
et
nous
avons
entendu
tirer
du
canon
jusque
vers
les
à
heures
du
soir
nous
avons
appris
depuis
que
ce
vaisseau
étoit
le
j
ordonnai
qu
on
tirât
de
la
poudrière
du
bastion
dauphin
les
poudres

et
les
fis
transporter
sous
la
poterne
de
la
courtine
qui
est
entre

et
celui
de

coupé
par

battoit
le
flanc

beaucoup
de
progrès
et
entr

fis
commencer
à
faire
percer
le
mur
de

de
deux
embrasures
pour
y
mettre
deux
canons

mis
en

fut
servi
autant
qu

pouvoit
désirer
sur
celui
de
l

l
ennemy
a
aussi
étably
une
batterie
de
cinq
canons
sur

apprenoit
sa
prise
le
mai
et
qu
il
avoit
tout
lieu
d
être
satisfait
du
traitement
qu
on
lui
faisoit
ainsy
qu
à
ses
officiers
et

et
de

sévèrement

je
répondis
à
celle
de
monsieur
warren
qu
il
n
y
avoit
point
de
françois
parmy
les
sauvages
qui
avoient
usé
ainsi
qu
il
disoit
de
cruauté
comme
de
fait
il
n
y
en
avoit
pas
qu
il
devoit
être
persuadé
que
je
négligeray
rien
pour
arrêter
le
cours
des
cruautés
des
sauvages
autant
qu
il
me
seroit
possible
de
communiquer
avec
eux
etc
a
celle
de
monsieur
de
la
maisonfort
que
je
ferai
défendre
aux
sauvages
lorsque
je
pourrai
avoir
communication
avec
eux
d
en
user
mieux
par
la
suite
qu
il
n
y
avoit
aucun
des
françois
avec
eux
lorsqu
ils
ont
usé
de
cruautés
et
l
officier
porteur
de
ces
lettres
partit
sur
le
champ
le
la
batterie
que
les
ennemis
ont
établie
à
la
tour
de
la
lanterne
de
canons
et
un
mortier
a
commencé
à
tirer
sur
celle
de
l
isle
de
l
entrée
avec
des
boulets
de
et
un
mortier
de
pouces
pesant
et
le
feu
de
la
dite
batterie
n
a
pas
cessé
de
tirer
jusqu
à
la
reddition
de
la
place
malgré
le
feu
continuel
de
celle
de

les
batteries
de
l

faisant
un
progrès
considérable
malgré
notre
feu
des

du

du

de
la
pièce
de
la
grave
et
de
la
mousqueterie
à
la
brèche
de
la
porte
dauphine
et
aux
corps
de
garde
joignants
j
ordonnai
à
monsieur
verrier
ingénieur
de
faire
un
retranchement
dans
le
bastion
dauphin
pour
défendre
l
assaut
que
l
ennemy
pourrait
donner
par
la
brèche
cet
ouvrage
qui
prenoit
depuis
le
quay
jusqu
au
parapet
de
la
face
du
bastion
dauphin
fut
mis
en
état
le
après
bien
des
travaux
de
nuit
il
se
fit
le
même
jour
une
jonction
de
vaisseaux
dont
deux
de
un
de
et
l
autre
de
canons
avec
ceux
qui
bloquoient
le
port
ces
vaisseaux
sitôt
qu
ils
eurent
tiré
les
signaux
de
reconnaissance
s
assemblèrent
et
après
s
être
parlés
ils
furent
vers
la
baye
de
gabarrus
le
lendemain
les
vaisseaux
ennemis
au
nombre
de
mouillèrent
en
ligne
vers
la
pointe
blanche
à
environ
lieues
du
port
de
louisbourg
l
ennemy
fit
faire
en
même
temps
et
le
lendemain
trois
piles
de
bois
pour
des
signaux
sur
les
hauteurs
qui
sont
à
l
ouest
du
port
de
louisbourg
je
ne
puis
pas
m
empêcher
d
informer
sa
grandeur
et
de
lui
dire
avec
vérité
que
toutes
les
batteries
de
l
ennemy
soit
de
mortier
ou
de
canon
n
ont
pas
cessé
de
tirer
depuis
les
jours
qu
ils
les
ont
établis
de
même
que
la
mousqueterie
sans
discontinuer
de
la
batterie
de
francœur
que
toutes
les
maisons
de
la
ville
ont
toutes
été
écrasées
criblées
et
mises
hors
d
état
d
être
logées
que
le
flanc
du
bastion
du
roy
a
été
tout
démoli
ainsy
que
les
embrasures
en
bois
qu
on
y
avoit
remplacées
qu
ils
ont
fait
brèche
à
la
porte
dauphine
le
corps
de
garde
joignant
et
qu
il
étoit
praticable
au
moyen
des
fascines
qu
ils
avoient
transporté
pendant
deux
jours
à
la
batterie
de
francœur
que
l
eperon
joignant
le
corps
de
garde
de
l
officier
de
la
porte
dauphine
étoit
tout
demantelé
ainsi
que
les
embrasures
du
quai
malgré
le
feu
continuel
de
tous
les
canons
mortiers
et
mousqueterie
que
nous
tirions
de
la
ville
et
qui
étoient
servis
avec
toute
la
vigueur
et
l
activité
qu
on
pouvoit
espérer
en
pareille
occasion
la
preuve
en
est
assez
évidente
monseigneur
puisque
de
milliers
de
poudre
que
nous
avions
au
commencement
du
siège
il
nous
n
en
restoit
le
juin
que
barils
en
ville
laquelle
quantité
m
étoit
absolument
nécessaire
pour
pouvoir
capituler
nous
avons
aussi
tiré
toutes
les
bombes
de
pouces
que
nous
avions
et
presque
toutes
celles
de
pouces
je
dois
rendre
justice
à
tous
les
officiers
de
la
garnison
aux
soldats
et
aux
habitans
qui
ont
défendu
la
place
ils
ont
tous
en
général
supporté
la
fatigue
de
ce
siège
avec
une
intrépidité
sans
égale
pendant
les
jours
qu
il
a
duré
passant
toutes
les
nuits
au
chemin
couvert
de
la
porte
dauphine
depuis
que
l
ennemy
avoit
commencé
à
battre
en
brèche
cet
endroit
à
soutenir
les
travaillants
qui
ôtoient
les
décombres
sur
les
remparts
aux
portes
qui
leur
étoient
destinées
sans
se
reposer
aucune
nuit
et
pour
le
jour
n
ayant
pas
un
seul
endroit
pour
sommeiller
sans
courir
risque
d
être
emporté
par
les
canons
de
l
ennemy
qui
commandoient
toute
la
ville
aussy
tout
le
monde
étoit
fatigué
de
travail
et
d
insomnie
et
de
que
nous
étions
au
commencement
du
siège
ont
été
tués
blessés
hors
d
état
de
rendre
service
plusieurs
étoient
tombés
malades
par
la
fatigue
aussy
les
remparts
qui
n
étoient
au
commencement
du
siège
garnis
que
de
à
pieds
se
trouvoient
presque
tous
dégarnis
le
de
juin
lorsque
les
habitans
de
la
ville
me
présentèrent
leur
requête
tendant
à
ce
que
les
forces
de
l
ennemy
soit
de
terre
et
de
mer
augmentant
tous
les
jours
sans
qu
ils
nous
parvint
aucun
secours
ni
apparence
d
en
avoir
d
assez
fort
pour
forcer
l
ennemy
il
me
plût
capituler
avec
les
généraux
afin
de
leur
conserver
le
peu
qu
il
leur
restoit
cette
requête
monseigneur
me
toucha
jusqu
au
plus
vif
de
mon
âme
d
un
côté
je
voyois
une
place
telle
que
louisbourg
et
qui
a
coûte
bien
des
sommes
au
roi
au
moment
d
être
enlevée
par
la
force
de
l
ennemy
qui
avoit
une
brèche
assez
practicable
pour
cela
et
des
vaisseaux
en
ligne
qui
s
installoient
depuis
deux
jours
d
autre
côté
il
me
paroissoit
un
nombre
d
habitans
tous
chargés
de
familles
au
moment
de
périr
perdre
par
conséquent
le
fruit
de
leurs
travaux
depuis
le
commencement
de
l
etablissement
de
la
colonie
dans
une
conjoncture
aussy
délicate
je
fis
rendre
compte
à
monsieur
verrier
ingénieur
en
chef
de
l
état
des
fortifications
de
la
place
et
à
monsieur
de
ste
marie
capitaine
chargé
de
l
artillerie
de
celui
des
munitions
de
guerre
l
un
et
l
autre
me
firent
leur
rapport
je
fis
tenir
conseil
de
guerre
qui
décida
unanimement
que
vu
les
forces
de
l
ennemy
et
l
état
de
la
place
il
convenoit
de
capituler
j
écrivis
une
lettre
à
le
sortie
du
conseil
à
messieurs
les
généraux
anglois
je
leur
demanday
une
suspension
d
armes
pour
le
temps
qu
il
me
seroit
convenable
pour
leur
faire
des
articles
de
capitulation
aux
conditions
desquelles
je
leur
remettrois
la
place
monsieur
de
laperelle
fils
qui
étoit
porteur
de
cette
lettre
me
rapporta
le
même
soir
leur
réponse
par
laquelle
ils
me
donnoient
le
temps
jusques
au
lendemain
à
huit
heures
du
matin
et
que
si
pendant
ce
temps
je
me
déterminois
à
me
rendre
prisonnier
de
guerre
je
pouvois
compter
que
je
serois
traité
avec
toute
la
générosité
possible
je
ne
m
attendois
pas
à
une
telle
réponse
aussy
le
lendemain
je
leur
envoyai
par
monsieur
de
bonnaventure
les
articles
de
capitulation
avec
une
seconde
lettre
par
laquelle
je
leur
mandai
que
les
conditions
faites
la
veille
étoient
trop
dures
que
je
ne
pouvois
les
accepter
et
que
c
étoit
à
ceux
que
je
faisois
par
mes
propositions
que
je
consentirois
à
leur
remettre
la
place
messieurs
les
généraux
ne
voulurent
pas
répondre
par
apostille
à
ces
propositions
mais
ils
me
renvoyèrent
leur
réponse
séparée
par
le
dit
sieur
de
bonnaventure
cette
réponse
m
accordoit
partie
des
articles
que
j
avois
demandés
mais
ceux
qui
m
étoient
le
plus
sensible
et
glorieux
qui
étoient
ceux
de
sortir
de
la
place
avec
les
honneurs
de
la
guerre
avec
arme
et
bagage
tambour
battant
et
drapeaux
déployés
ne
s
y
trouvoient
pas
insérés
aussy
je
leur
écrivis
sur
le
champ
deux
lettres
l
une
au
chef
d
escadre
et
l
autre
au
général
de
terre
que
je
ne
pouvois
consentir
à
laisser
sortir
les
troupes
de
la
place
sans
ces
articles
qui
étoient
des
honneurs
dûs
à
des
troupes
qui
avoient
fait
leur
devoir
que
cela
accordé
je
consentois
aux
articles
messieurs
les
généraux
m
écrivirent
en
réponse
qu
ils
accordoient
cet
article
et
monsieur
warren
augmenta
des
conditions
pour
la
reddition
de
l
isle
et
de
la
place
les
ratifications
ont
été
signées
de
part
et
d
autre
mais
messieurs
les
généraux
anglois
bien
loin
d
avoir
exécuté
de
leur
part
la
dite
capitulation
ainsy
que
j
ai
fait
du
mien
en
tout
son
contenu
ils
ont
manqué
en
plusieurs
articles
au
premier
article
il
est
dit
que
tous
les
effets
mobiliers
de
tous
les
sujets
du
roy
de
france
qui
étoient
dans
louisbourg
leur
seroient
laissés
et
qu
ils
auroient
la
liberté
de
les
emporter
avec
eux
dans
tels
ports
d
europe
de
la
domination
de
leur
roy
qu
ils
jugeront
à
propos
tous
les
battiments
qui
étoient
dans
le
port
appartenant
aux
particuliers
faisaient
partie
de
leurs
effets
mobiliers
cependant
les
anglois
s
en
sont
emparés
et
les
ont
garde
pour
eux
tous
les
particuliers
généralement
quelconques
qui
ont
passé
en
france
n
ont
pu
emporter
aucune
armoire
chaise
fauteuil
table
bureau
chenets
et
autres
meubles
de
cette
nature
ny
même
aucune
grosse
marchandise
messieurs
les
généraux
n
ayant
point
fourni
des
battiments
pour
cela
nécessaires
ils
n
ont
pas
été
pillés
mais
à
bien
examiner
la
chose
ne
pouvant
pas
emporter
le
peu
de
meubles
qu
ils
avoient
faute
de
battiments
ils
ont
éte
obligés
de
les
laisser
ce
qu
ils
ont
laissé
à
louisbourg
est
tout
comme
si
on
leur
avait
pillé
à
moins
que
sa
grandeur
ne
fasse
faire
raison
par
la
cour
d
angleterre
ils
ont
encore
manqué
à
cet
article
pendant
le
temps
que
j
étois
à
la
colonie
ils
ont
fait
partir
à
mon
insu
matelots
et
particuliers
pour
baston
ils
étoient
embarqués
ainsi
que
les
troupes
sur
des
vaisseaux
de
guerre
jusqu
à
leur
embarquement
pour
la
france
mais
un
matin
le
vaisseau
dans
lequel
ils
étoient
eut
ordre
de
partir
pour
baston
et
fit
voile
j
en
fus
informé
j
en
portai
ma
plainte
mais
cela
n
aboutit
à
autre
chose
sinon
qu
ils
n
avoient
pu
faire
autrement
faute
de
vivres
et
de
battiment
et
qu
on
les
feroit
repasser
de
baston
en
france
ces
matelots
n
ont
pas
été
les
seuls
j
ai
été
informé
que
depuis
mon
départ
ils
ont
agi
de
même
à
l
égard
des
familles
qui
n
avoient
pu
être
placées
sur
les
bâtiments
de
transport
qu
ils
avoient
destiné
pour
la
france
si
les
généraux
anglois
avoient
voulu
les
bâtiments
qui
ont
transporté
ces
familles
à
boston
les
auroient
transportées
pour
france
ils
avoient
des
vivres
en
magazin
beaucoup
plus
que
pour
la
traversée
mais
ils
n
ont
agi
ainsi
qu
afin
de
disperser
la
colonie
le
article
regarde
les
battiments
qui
étoient
dans
le
port
et
ceux
qu
ils
devoient
fournir
en
cas
que
les
premiers
ne
fussent
pas
suffisants
pour
faire
le
transport
j
ay
fait
mes
remarques
à
ceci
au
précédent
article
c
est
un
des
plus
considérables
par
rapport
à
la
valeur
des
choses
y
ayant
quantité
de
battiments
dans
le
port
qui
étoient
coulés
ou
échoués
et
dont
l
ennemy
ne
pouvoit
en
faire
sortir
aucun
du
port
ny
faire
aucun
usage
tant
que
nos
batteries
auroient
existé
au
surplus
si
plusieurs
particuliers
de
la
ville
n
avoient
pas
acheté
des
battiments
les
anglois
auroient
profité
de
tous
les
effets
qu
ils
y
ont
chargés
ainsi
qu
ils
ont
fait
de
ceux
qui
n
avoient
pas
le
moyen
d
en
acheter
ces
familles
auroient
été
contraintes
ainsi
que
celles
qui
se
sont
embarquées
en
payant
de
gros
frets
de
passer
à
boston
a
l
égard
du
dernier
article
des
armes
tous
les
habitans
avoient
les
leurs
et
les
ont
remises
en
dépôt
sitôt
la
reddition
de
la
place
ces
armes
étoient
partie
de
leurs
effets
les
ennemis
n
ont
pas
voulu
les
rendre
je
m
en
suis
plaint
ils
m
ont
fait
réponse
lorsqu
ils
ont
envoyé
les
matelots
qu
ils
leur
enverroient
leurs
armes
les
autres
habitans
sont
dans
le
même
cas
je
crois
devoir
vous
informer
monseigneur
qu
ils
se
sont
aussy
emparés
de
tous
les
effets
et
ustensils
de
l
hôpital
et
des
magasins

fait
ses
representations

eu
aucun
fruit

vous
rendra
compte

charger

surrendred
to
monsieur
he
goes
on
to
say
that
a
report
was
spread
there
that
monsieur
duvivier
was
arriv
d
at
canada
with
rigging
for
two
men
of
war
and
the
renommée
a
french
thirty
gun
ship
with
two
prizes
at
quebec
and
all
the
nova
scotia
priests
were
gone
to
canada
for
instructions
and
give
out
that
there
are
canadeans
at
chignecto
waiting
ready
for
another
attempt
against
his
majesty
s
garrison
to
which
i
would
beg
leave
to
subjoin
that
it
seems
to
me
far
from
being
improbable
that
the
french
will
attempt
the
reduction
of
nova
scotia
early
in
the
spring
by
gaining
which
they
will
have
a
fine
provision
country
to
assemble
or
fighting
men
and
all
the
tribes
of
indians
ready
to
join
in
an
attempt
against
louisbourg
at
a
few
days
warning
as
i
observ
d
to
your
grace
in
a
late
letter
but
if
they
should
not
attempt
louisbourg
they
would
irresistably
break
up
all
the
eastern
settlements
of
this
province
and
i
doubt
not
the
whole
province
of
new
hampshire
it
self
which
would
make
em
masters
of
all
mast
country
and
naval
stores
and
of
a
rich
soil
for
corn
as
well
as
cattle
and
this
would
also
enable
em
to
make
deep
impressions
on
all
the
western
frontier
of
this
province
new
york
and
connecticut
and
how
far
they
might
penetrate
is
not
certain
but
so
far
at
least
as
might
make
it
very
difficult
to
dislodge
em
and
give
em
such
an
hold
of
the
continent
as
to
make
em
think
in
time
of
pushing
with
the
assistance
of
the
indians
for
the
mastery
of
it
which
is
richly
worth
contending
for
with
all
their
might
as
it
would
in
their
hands
lay
the
surest
foundation
for
an
universal
monarchy
by
sea
and
land
that
ever
a
people
had
this
train
of
consequences
from
the
enemies
being
masters
of
nova
scotia
may
seem
remote
my
lord
but
they
are
not
impossible
and
it
may
be
very
difficult
for
the
french
to
regain
louisbourg
at
least
without
being
masters
of
nova
scotia
and
that
seems
under
the
present
circumstances
of
the
garrison
where
no
recruits
are
yet
arriv
d
from
england
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
surrounding
it
are
enemies
in
their
hearts
no
difficult
acquisition
and
to
be
made
with
a
small
train
of
artillery
in
three
weeks
at
farthest
i
would
submit
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
whether
the
garrison
should
not
be
reinforc
d
as
soon
as
may
be
and
the
inhabitants
should
not
be
forthwith
put
upon
a
good
foot
of
subjection
and
fidelity
thus
in
obedience
to
your
grace
s
direction
i
have
troubled
you
with
my
whole
sentiments
concerning
the
province
of
nova
scotia
which
as
i
can
t
think
it
probable
that
the
french
will
sleep
the
next
year
after
the
blow
we
have
given
em
at
louisbourg
which
if
they
don
t
recover
it
soon
by
retaking
cape
breton
or
getting
nova
scotia
will
prove
their
death
wound
in
north
america
seems
to
be
most
likely
to
be
attack
d
by
em
of
any
place
in
these
parts
and
i
hope
your
grace
will
excuse
my
repetition
of
the
danger
of
it
i
am
with
the
most
dutiful
regards
my
lord
duke
your
grace
s
most
and
most
devoted
servant
w
shirley
to
newcastle
my
lord
duke
since
my
last
to
your
grace
i
have
received
the
inclos
d
packett
from
mascarene
containing
a
representation
of
the
state
of
nova
scotia
from
himself
and
his
majesty
s
council
of
that
province
with
a
copy
of
a
letter
from
him
to
me
showing
the
reasons
of
his
late
conduct
towards
the
french
inhabitants
your
grace
will
perceive
that
this
representation
is
drawn
up
in
stronger
terms
against
the
inhabitants
than
mine
i
could
wish
the
gentlemen
had
been
more
explicit
in
what
they
would
recommend
as
the
most
adviseable
method
of
securing
his
majesty
s
government
within
the
province
and
against
the
french
inhabitants
but
as
that
is
not
done
except
in
short
hints
and
little
to
whom
both
mascarene
and
secretary
shirreff
referr
me
for
a
larger
account
of
the
sentiments
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
garrison
concerning
these
matters
offers
his
service
to
go
with
my
dispatches
to
england
and
return
directly
with
any
orders
his
majesty
may
be
pleased
to
give
thereupon
i
have
sent
him
to
wait
upon
your
grace
and
it
is
possible
that
when
he
is
upon
the
spot
ready
to
answer
any
questions
it
may
be
of
service
having
before
troubled
your
grace
so
largely
upon
this
head
i
will
beg
leave
to
referr
to
my
former
letters
little
mr
agent
kilby
and
bollan
which
two
last
can
i
believe
give
considerable
light
on
the
affair
and
shall
only
add
that
the
spring
before
last
the
garrison
was
very
narrowly
saved
from
the
enemy
by
the
arrival
of
the
new
england
auxiliaries
and
the
last
spring
by
the
expedition
against
cape
breton
that
the
preservation
of
it
this
spring
will
be
of
the
utmost
importance
to
his
majesty
s
service
in
america
and
that
nothing
will
more
effectually
secure
that
than
putting
the
inhabitants
upon
a
proper
foot
of
subjection
in
the
most
speedy
manner
to
prevent
their
revolt
which
can
not
be
done
without
his
majesty
s
special
directions
for
that
purpose
for
the
procuring
of
which
i
find
mascarene
and
his
whole
council
have
a
dependance
upon
me
the
language
of
their
several
letters
being
that
they
themselves
to
my
and
will
take
no
step
without
my
advice
or
approbation
which
has
been
the
case
for
above
these
last
two
years
and
i
mention
to
your
grace
in
excuse
for
my
being
so
importunate
in
the
affairs
of
another
government
which
the
gentlemen
of
the
garrison
lay
me
under
a
necessity
of
being
and
i
am
further
urg
d
to
this
by
the
late
accounts
ch
mascarene
and
the
other
gentlemen
have
sent
me
of
the
appearance
of
four
hundred
indians
well
cloathed
arm
d
and
supply
d
with
stores
from
canada
near
johns
river
seventeen
french
officers
being
seen
among
em
and
another
body
of
french
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
province
and
reports
that
duvivier
in
the
parfaite
man
of
warr
and
another
ship
of
force
were
at
qubec
with
stores
and
another
was
seen
to
put
into
johns
island
that
the
priests
who
went
to
canada
for
instructions
are
returned
with
supplies
and
large
promises
to
the
indians
before
well
dispos
d
and
upon
the
point
of
putting
themselves
under
our
protection
on
the
taking
of
louisbourg
and
encouragements
for
the
inhabitants
to
depend
upon
a
powerfull
force
against
the
fort
at
annapolis
royal
this
spring
these
alarms
indeed
have
been
something
allay
d
by
letters
from
the
deputies
of
minas
and
other
districts
to
mascarene
which
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
great
dependance
upon
but
it
seems
plain
upon
the
whole
that
the
french
are
making
the
utmost
efforts
to
retain
the
indians
of
those
parts
in
their
interest
and
gaining
over
the
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
so
that
the
taking
of
speedy
measures
for
securing
these
last
and
gaining
over
the
former
which
will
depend
upon
that
as
the
preservation
of
nova
scotia
does
upon
both
is
a
matter
of
the
highest
consequence
upon
this
occasion
it
seems
necessary
for
me
to
apprise
your
grace
that
mascarene
and
his
council
have
not
so
good
an
harmony
subsisting
between
them
as
could
be
wish
d
and
that
all
the
officers
have
of
late
differ
d
in
sentiments
with
him
particularly
upon
the
behaviour
of
the
french
inhabitants
concerning
whom
he
indeed
has
himself
alter
d
his
opinion
in
some
measure
but
i
think
there
may
be
still
danger
of
too
much
tenderness
towards
em
on
his
part
and
perhaps
rigour
on
theirs
in
carrying
any
orders
of
his
majesty
s
into
execution
so
that
by
their
jarring
the
execution
of
the
orders
may
possibly
be
obstructed
if
they
are
left
to
themselves
wherefore
if
their
chief
governour
s
age
and
health
and
other
circumstances
would
have
permitted
him
to
have
been
upon
the
spott
and
assisted
in
this
service
it
would
i
believe
have
been
for
the
advantage
of
it
for
him
to
have
made
em
a
short
visit
at
least
this
year
and
if
it
could
have
been
repeated
for
the
two
or
three
proceeding
years
it
would
have
been
still
more
so
shirley
to
newcastle
may
i
think
it
my
indispensable
duty
to
suggest
again
to
your
grace
my
fears
that
the
enemy
will
soon
find
an
opportunity
of
snatching
accadie
by
some
sudden
stroke
from
his
majesty
s
government
unless
the
danger
is
remov
d
out
of
the
heart
of
it
there
by
a
removal
of
the
most
dangerous
of
the
french
inhabitants
from
thence
transplanting
english
families
there
in
their
room
which
i
think
very
practicable
from
hence
having
lately
found
means
of
transplanting
upwards
i
believe
of
an
hundred
families
from
the
province
to
louisbourg
towards
the
settlement
of
it
which
yet
i
dont
esteem
of
such
importance
to
be
immediately
done
as
the
settlement
of
nova
scotia
with
faithful
subjects
in
the
meanwhile
till
this
can
be
happily
effected
the
indians
in
those
parts
secur
d
in
the
english
interest
i
have
propos
d
to
warren
that
a
detachment
of
men
should
be
sent
from
louisbourg
to
reinforce
the
garrison
at
annapolis
royal
since
the
late
miscarriage
of
out
of
of
the
recruits
designed
for
annapolis
in
their
passage
from
england
to
the
garrison
there
of
the
remainder
of
em
which
came
in
here
i
with
difficulty
have
got
recovered
in
his
majesty
s
castle
william
at
the
hospital
in
boston
sent
a
month
ago
to
annapolis
where
i
hear
they
are
safely
arriv
d
and
twenty
more
who
are
in
a
fair
way
of
being
serviceable
i
shall
send
from
the
hospital
within
three
days
but
the
garrison
will
still
be
weak
as
mascarene
has
dismiss
d
most
of
the
new
england
auxiliaries
and
they
have
not
i
am
informed
effective
private
men
left
besides
their
artificers
workmen
i
have
also
recommended
to
warren
the
frequent
sending
of
a
ship
of
war
to
look
into
the
bason
of
annapolis
make
the
garrison
there
a
short
visit
in
order
to
prevent
a
surprise
by
his
opinion
in
concurrence
with
sir
pepperrell
s
mascarene
s
my
own
a
sloop
has
been
hir
d
employ
d
for
about
these
last
four
months
to
attend
upon
that
garrison
carry
intelligence
between
annapolis
royal
louisbourg
boston
concerning
the
state
of
it
the
enemy
s
motions
which
we
conceiv
d
necessary
to
be
done
for
its
security
and
hope
your
grace
will
not
disapprove
of
what
frontenac
observed
some
years
ago
to
pontchartrain
concerning
the
french
king
s
recovering
of
accadie
making
himself
absolute
master
of
the
great
bank
of
newfoundland
as
in
the
inclos
d
extract
of
his
letter
seems
so
seasonable
to
be
consider
d
at
this
time
that
i
would
beg
leave
to
observe
to
your
grace
upon
it
that
his
ty
s
holding
the
possession
of
annapolis
royal
newfoundland
already
conceded
to
his
crown
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
with
his
late
acquisition
of
cape
breton
will
put
the
whole
cod
fishery
more
in
his
power
than
frontenac
s
scheme
could
have
put
it
into
the
french
kings
and
that
besides
what
frontenac
calls
a
commerce
more
advantageous
than
the
conquest
of
the
indies
and
computes
the
returns
of
at
twenty
millions
i
suppose
french
livres
per
annum
it
would
furnish
his
majesty
with
as
good
a
nursery
of
seamen
for
the
royal
navy
as
the
colliery
in
england
does
not
to
mention
the
great
consumption
of
british
manufactures
which
must
be
occasioned
in
carrying
the
fishery
on
that
the
holding
of
annapolis
royal
in
particular
will
be
establishing
to
his
majesty
the
mastery
of
the
northern
part
of
this
continent
against
the
french
secure
to
him
inexhaustible
nurseries
of
masts
yards
bowsprits
other
stores
for
his
navy
timber
for
ship
building
within
his
northern
colonies
independent
of
any
foreign
state
to
be
purchased
with
british
manufactures
transported
in
british
vessels
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
colonies
would
in
time
make
such
an
addition
of
subjects
to
the
crown
of
great
britain
as
would
make
their
number
superior
to
that
of
any
prince
s
upon
the
continent
of
europe
and
in
the
meanwhile
the
vent
of
woolen
other
british
manufactures
all
kinds
of
european
commodities
imported
into
the
colonies
from
great
britain
must
increase
in
proportion
to
the
increase
of
their
inhabitants
by
all
which
means
the
main
sources
of
wealth
a
larger
extent
of
power
by
sea
land
than
any
state
in
christendom
at
present
enjoys

capable
of
being
secur

ty

but
which
will
in
the
end
otherwise
be
in
all
human
probability
the
lot
of
the
french
dominions
and
i
would
in
particular
observe
to
your
grace
the
most
practicable
step
the
enemy
can
attempt
making
towards
their
obtaining
that
seems
clearly
to
be
their

consequences

so
strong
an
hold

w
shirley
to
newcastle
may
i
would
beg
leave
to
observe
to
your
grace
the
danger
to
his
majesty
s
garrison
arises
chiefly
from
within
the
heart
of
the
government
itself
the
inhabitants
neighboring
indians
whose
numbers
are
sufficient
of
themselves
with
a
small
assistance
from
canada
the
help
of
a
proper
train
of
artillery
slipt
up
the
bay
in
small
vessells
ch
would
give
em
great
encouragement
to
take
up
arms
the
garrison
to
reduce
it
however
while
the
attempt
against
canada
is
depending
that
will
certainly
go
far
towards
holding
the
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
in
suspense
till
the
success
of
it
is
known
i
hope
by
next
spring
they
may
either
be
put
upon
a
better
foot
of
subjection
or
the
most
dangerous
among
em
removed
shirley
to
newcastle
june
i
may
assure
your
grace
one
of
the
principal
motives
i
had
to
desire
i
might
succeed
general
phillips
in
his
command
was
the
hopes
i
have
of
it
s
putting
it
in
my
power
to
promote
his
majesty
s
service
in
his
province

nova
scotia
by
securing
the
fidelity
allegiance
of
the
inhabitants
there
to
his
majesty
s
government
in
the
best
manner
and
thereby
preventing
the
french
from
making
themselves
masters
of
it
the
acquisition
of
ch
to
them
with
the
help
of
the
indians
would
likewise
endanger
the
loss
of
the
province
of
new
hampshire

mast
country
to
his

enable

an
inevitable
tendency
to
make
themselves
masters
of
the

to

the
continual
danger
ch
their

at
the

time
expose
cape

the
considerations

induc
d
me
to
take
the
liberty
of
submitting
it
to
your

whether
it
might
not

for
his

service
that
before
the
six

time
i
am
not
certain
whether
a
sufficient
strength
might
not
be
spar
d
from
the
garrison
at
louisbourg
a
short
time
for
this
purpose
ch
if
it
could
would
make
the
assistance
of
any
other
troops
needless
and
i
would
particularly
submit
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
whether
in
case
of
any
disappoinment
in
the
present
attempt
for
the
reduction
of
canada
the
immediate
removal
of
some
at
least
of
the
french
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
securing
the
province
in
the
best
manner
would
not
be
adviseable
and
even
necessary
if
your
grace
should
think
this
deserves
so
much
of
your
attention
there
will
be
time
enough
for
transmitting
his
majesty
s
commands
to
me
upon
it
before
the
present
expedition
is
over
i
am
with
the
most
dutifull
regard
my
lord
duke
your
grace
s
most
devoted
most
obedient
servant
w
shirley
to
newcastle
july
i
must
acknowledge
i
should
rather
apprehend
the
french
fleet
if
it
is
design
d
for
north
america
is
order
d
to
canada
or
else
to
annapolis
royal
where
the
enemy
may
depend
that
upon
the
apperance
of
such
an
armament
the
french
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
to
the
amount
of
between
fighting
men
and
a
considerable
number
of
indians
some
canadeans
would
immediately
join
em
and
they
would
have
a
most
convenient
country
to
rendezvous
in
within
a
very
few
days
sail
of
chappeaurouge
bay
at
cape
breton
and
be
not
far
from
canada
than
that
they
should
attempt
to
enter
louisbourg
harbour
with
their
ships
and
i
am
the
more
inclin
d
to
this
opinion
from
the
accounts
i
have
receiv
d
lately
from
mascarene
and
the
officers
of
the
garrison
at
annapolis
royal
which
inform
me
that
the
french
inhabitants
at
menis
schiegneto
in
nova
scotia
have
cut
off
all
communication
with
the
garrison
for
these
last
five
weeks
and
have
stop
d
the
messengers
sent
from
thence
by
mascarene
for
intelligence
being
in
expectation
of
an
armament
from
france
and
indeed
it
seems
probable
that
this
will
for
ever
be
the
case
and
that
the
province
of
nova
scotia
will
never
be
out
of
danger
whilst
the
french
inhabitants
are
suffer
d
to
remain
in
nova
scotia
upon
their
present
foot
of
shirley
to
newcastle
i
shall
finish
my
troubleing
your
grace
upon
the
affairs
of
nova
scotia
with
this
letter
after
having
once
more
submitted
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
as
a
proper
scheme
for
better
securing
the
subjection
of
the
french
inhabitants
and
indians
there
that
the
governour
council
or
such
other
person
or
persons
as
his
majesty
shall
think
fitt
to
join
with
em
should
have
a
special
authority
and
directions
from
his

forthwith
to
apprehend

a
convenient
number
of
such
of
the
inhabitants

be
by

judg

to
be
most
obnoxious
dangerous
to
his

government
upon
finding
em
guilty
of
holding
any
treasonable
correspondence

c
to
dispose

taking

two

sir
having
been
inform

that
the
french

of

entertain
some
jealousy
of
a
design
in
the
english
government
to
remove
them
with
their
families
from
their

transport
them
to

i

that
you

to
signify
to
em
that
it
is
probable
if
his

had
declar
d
such
intention
i
might
have
heard
of
the

but
that
i
am
perfectly
unaquainted
with
any
such
design
and
am
perswaded
there
is
no
just
ground
for
this
jealousy
and
be
pleas

to
assure
em
that
i
shall
use
my
best
endeavours
by
a

protection

such
of

as
shall
behave
dutifully
refuse

i

not

that
all
such
of
em
will
be
protected
by
his

in
the
possession

and
i
desire
you
would
also
be
pleas
d
to
inform

that
it
is
expected
from
his
tys
french
subjects
in
that
province
who
have
for
so
long
time
enjoyed
the
same
privileges
with
his
natural
born
subjects
there
have
been
under
a
much
easier
government
than
any
of
the
french
king
s
subjects
are
in
the
neighbouring
province
of
canada
other
parts
of
the
french
king

that
their

as
well
as
their

gratitude
should
bind
them
to
a
strict
fidelity
obedience
to
his

his
government
but
on
the
contrary
if
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
said
province
shall
join
with
the
enemy
especially
those
that
have
been
sent
from
canada
to
seduce
them
from
their
duty
to
his
majesty
attachment
to
the
english
interest
they
must
expect
to
be
treated
in
the

manner

his

would
be
under
the
like
provocations
i
am
with
great
regard
sir
your
most
obedient
humble
servant
w
shirley
to
newcastle
boston
september
my
lord
duke
i
express
d
some
hopes
in
my
last
but
one
to
your
grace
that
i
should
not
be
oblig
d
to
add
to
my
former
accounts
of
the
imminent
danger
his
majesty
s
province
of
nova
scotia
was
in
of
being
surpriz
d
by
the
enemy
but
find
my
self
under
a
necessity
of
doing
it
from
the
advices
which
i
have
since
receiv
d
from
mascarene
and
the
intelligence
contain
d
in
three
declarations
upon
oath
copies
of
all
which
are
inclos
d
upon
the
receipt
of
mascarene
s
letter
the
contents
of
which
are
confirm
d
to
me
by
other
authentick
accounts
it
appear
d
to
me
that
there
was
no
room
to
doubt
but
that
a
considerable
body
of
french
and
indians
from
canada
was
assembled
in
nova
scotia
with
expectations
of
a
reinforcement
from
france
and
if
they
fail
d
of
that
this
year
a
design
of
at
least
wintering
in
minas
or
some
other
part
of
the
country
by
which
means
they
would
have
an
opportunity
of
fortifying
themselves
in
it
transporting
their
great
artillery
which
there
was
then
the
utmost
reason
to
believe
they
had
landed
either
at
bay
verte
or
chebucto
harbour
to
annapolis
and
work
upon
the
french
inhabitants
already
ripe
for
a
revolt
to
join
em
in
attacking
his
majesty
s
garrison
there
so
early
in
the
spring
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
if
not
impracticable
to
relieve
it
by
any
succours
either
from
louisbourg
or
the
colonies
on
the
continent
whereupon
i
immediately
sent
mascarene
an
assurance
that
i
would
send
him
as
soon
as
possible
of
the
new
levies
from
this
province
of
em
which
seems
to
be
as
many
as
the
garrison
can
hold
at
present
besides
the
troops
already
there
for
the
reinforcement
of
it
and
of
em
to
be
employ
d
in
two
sloops
up
the
bay
in
the
manner
mascarene
proposes
in
his
letter
to
me
and
that
i
would
do
the
utmost
in
my
power
to
make
the
number
up
soon
afterwards
in
order
to
dislodge
the
enemy
prevent
em
from
wintering
in
the
province
and
in
the
mean
time
upon
my
advising
with
rear
admiral
warren
who
is
still
here
he
immediately
sent
his
majesty
s
ship
chester
a
gun
ship
to
annapolis
royal
for
the
further
countenance
protection
of
the
garrison
there
some
days
after
this
i
receiv
d
information
that
a
fleet
of
upwards
of
sail

about

of

which
lies
upon
the

of

nova

about
leagues
to
the
eastward
of
boston
and
about
leagues
westward
of
louisbourg
about
distant
from
annapolis
royal
according
to
champions
inclos
d
deposition
which
was
confirm
d
by
another
of
the
same
tenour
made
by
one
thornton
sent
me
from
piscataqua
upon
which
i
dispatched
an
arm
d
brigantine
with
orders
to
look
into
chibucto
harbour
if
the
master
should
discover
any
thing
to
proceed
directly
to

give
vice

townsend
knowles
intelligence
of
it
to
send
me
advice
of
it

by
some
fishing

taken
up
at

but
the
brigantine
return
d
in
less
than
hours
with
one
stanwood
a

on

fell
in
with

th

of

it
standing
a

for
chibucto
about
leagues
to
the
of
it
was
chas
d
by
one
of
em
according
to
the
inclos
d
deposition
which
series
of
intelligence
as
no
vessel
has
arriv
d
here
yet
from
this
fleet
which
must
in
all
probability
have
happen
d
had
it
come
from
england
compar
d
with
the
accounts
in
the
english
news
papers
of
the
brest
fleet
s
sailing
the
intelligence
gain
d
from
a
french
prize
lately
taken
by
one
of
townsend
s
squadron
near
the
mouth
of
lawrence
that
she
came
out
with
the
brest
squadron
sail
d
in
company
with
it
eight
days
the
account
we
had
of
two
large
french
ships
being
seen
to
go
into
chibucto
harbour
about
two
months
ago
the
behavior
of
the
french
in
nova
scotia
their
declar
d
expectations
of
a
large
french
armament
about
this
time
seems
to
make
it
very
probable
that
these
ships
may
be
part
of
the
brest
squadron
that
they
have
an
immediate
design
upon
nova
scotia
at
hereupon
i
sent
an
express
boat
to
louisbourg
to
apprize
admiral
townsend
knowles
of
it
another
to
annapolis
royal
to
give
mascarene
advice
of
it
to
let
him
know
that
i
was
embarking
men
for
the
reinforcement
of
the
garrison
under
his
command
which
is
done
part
of
em
sail
d
with
a
promise
of
farther
succours
and
to
apprize
him
that
from
the
publick
accounts
in
the
english
prints
we
had
reason
to
depend
upon
the
speedy
arrival
of
general
clair
with
the
british
troops
under
his
command
a
squadron
of
his
majesty
s
ships
with
em
at
louisbourg
and
as
i
have
reason
to
think
that
an
apprehension
generally
prevails
among
the
french
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
that
they
shall
all
of
em
soon
be
remov
d
from
their
settlements
there
without
distinction
which
may
have
a
bad
influence
upon
em
in
favour
of
the
enemy
at
this
critical
time
i
have
wrote
mascarene
a
letter
a
copy
of
which
i
inclose
to
your
grace
which
is
translated
into
french
printed
in
order
to
be
dispers
d
among
the
french
inhabitants
if
mascarene
to
whose
discretion
i
have
submitted
it
either
to
make
use
of
or
suppress
the
printed
copies
shall
be
of
opinion
that
the
publication
of
it
among
em
may
be
for
his
majesty
s
service
if
the
fleet
discover
d
on
the
cape
sable
coast
should
be
part
of
that
from
brest
doubtless
their
visit
to
nova
scotia
has
been
encourag
d
by
the
general
disposition
of
the
inhabitants
the
strength
they
will
add
to
em
for
the
reduction
of
that
province
afterwards
for
an
attempt
upon
louisbourg
if
they
should
think
it
adviseable
to
make
one
as
also
for
the
defence
of
canada
should
they
succeed
in
an
immediate
attempt
upon
nova
scotia
which
i
should
not
be
surpriz
d
at
general
clair
with
the
squadron
expected
from
england
should
arrive
in
time
for
that
purpose
i
should
propose
attempting
the
immediate
recovery
of
it
out
of
the
enemy
s
hands
this
year
for
their
holding
that
province
till
they
can
fortify
it
and
farther
strengthen
themselves
there
must
be
attended
with
very
bad
consequences
to
his
majesty
s
service
worse
than
may
be
immediately
apprehended
create
no
inconsiderable
perplexities
at
least
it
seems
a
clear
point
to
me
that
if
the
french
should
hold
the
possession
of
nova
scotia
in
addition
to
canada
the
fate
of
affairs
in
his
majesty
s
northern
colonies
will
be
suddenly
alter
d
in
a
surprizing
manner
it
will
then
soon
be
discern
d
that
the
mastery
of
the
northern
parts
of
this
continent
together
with
the
sources
of
wealth
power
depending
upon
it
will
be
in
a
very
fair
way
of
being
finally
transfer
d
to
the
enemy
upwards
of
two
months
ago
upon
receiving
intelligence
of
the
appearance
of
two
large
french
ships
being
seen
to
go
into
chibucto
harbour
warren
i
sent
townsend
notice
of
it
but
as
we
had
not
learn
d
whether
any
vessell
had
been
sent
from
louisbourg
to
look
into
that
harbour
i
sent
an
arm
d
brigantine
to
make
discoveries
there
which
was
hinder
d
from
proceeding
thither
as
is
before
mention
d
i
have
now
sent
a
schooner
thither
with
a
person
who
has
undertaken
to
go
into
it
in
a
whale
boat
high
enough
to
make
an
exact
discovery
of
the
enemy
s
strength
if
any
of
their
ships
are
there
to
carry
the
account
to
louisbourg
but
it
seems
possible
if
any
of
em
have
been
there
that
after
landing
some
troops
and
stores
at
chibucto
getting
what
intelligence
they
can
from
the
nova
scotians
their
ships
may
be
gone
to
canada
for
which
place
we
have
been
inform
d
that
sixteen
french
vessels
some
of
em
ships
of
war
had
some
time
ago
pass
d
up
the
river
of
st
laurence
since
that
six
other
vessels
with
stores
so
that
it
is
very
probable
that
quebec
is
much
better
prepar
d
to
receive
a
visit
from
his
majesty
s
land
sea
forces
now
than
it
was
a
little
time
shirley
to
newcastle
it
is
agreed
by
all
the
prisoners
that
the
french
have
not
fortify
d
at
chebucto
nor
sent
any
troops
from
thence
by
land
to
join
the
canadeans
as
also
that
destonnel
the
chief
d
escadre
commandant
upon
the
death
of
the
duke
d
anville
who
was
of
opinion
to
return
to
france
after
the
admiral
s
death
without
attempting
any
thing
upon

from

s
declaration
how
ready
a
disposition
the
nova

show
d
to
afford
ts

that
they

to
the

their

join

they
should
send
for
the
reduction
of
his
ty

from
the
number
of

the
french
had
with
em
that
their
scheme
was
to
hold
fortify
annapolis
for
ch
purpose
it
seems
to
be
that
the
brass
cannon
were
brought
rather
than
for
raising
batteries
against
the

that
from
the
number
of
their
small

they

to

as

as

by

the
apprehensions

prevail
among
the
nova
scotians
that
they
are
at
present
rather
neutrals
than
subjects
to
the
crown
of
great
britain
and
i
think
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
now
but
that
the
principal
part
of
the
french
scheme
was
the
reduction
of
nova
scotia
in
the
first
place
upon
the
whole
the
sickly

of

fell

precipitate
departure
from

with
their
detaining
the

of

english
prisoners
till
they
were
got
leagues
from

dismissing

with
a
notion
that
their

was
going
up
the

of
fundy
to
annapolis
instead
of
carrying
em
up
there
with
em
to
prevent
that

being

it
seem
probable
that
the

nothing

be

importunate
with

the

perswasion
of
the
very
great
importance
of

to

of
the

bad

from

will
perceive
what
pains
the

among

take
to
prevent
my
letter
lately
dispers
d
among
em
in
order
to
setle
the
minds
of
the
inhabitants
a
copy
of
which
i
have
before
sent
your

from
having
its
proper
influence
how
the
nova
scotians
are
alarm
d
at
the
rumour
of
a
design
to
remove
em
from
their
settlements
and
it
appears
to
me
by
what
i
farther
learn
from
captain
fotheringham
to
whom
mascarene
refers
me
in
his
letter
that
unless
something
vigorous
as
that
letter
intimates
is
done
by
the
middle
of
april
at
farthest
the
greatest
part
of
the
province
at
least
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
canadeans
and
it
will
be
too
late
then
to
attempt
to
reclaim
the
inhabitants
for
the
securing
nova
scotia
from
its
present
dangers
i
would
further
humbly
propose
it
as
my
opinion
to
be
consider
d
by
your
grace
that
if
his
majesty
should
be
pleas
d
as
soon
as
possibly
might
be
after
the
receipt
of
this
to
cause
it
to
be
signified
to
the
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
that
the
assurances
lately
given
em
by
me
of
his
royal
protection
to
such
of
em
as
should
behave
dutifully
and
avoid
all
traiterous
correspondence
with
the
enemy
at
this
juncture
or
to
that
effect
were
approv
d
of
by
him
and
should
be
made
good
to
em
it
would
have
a
great
tendency
to
remove
their
present
apprehensions
of
being
sent
off
with
their
families
from
their
settlements
in
nova
scotia
which
seems
to
distress
perplex
em
effectually
to
prevent
em
from
being
drawn
over
to
take
up
arms
against
his
majesty
unless
it
should
be
some
of
the
most
obnoxious
of
em
which
if
his
majesty
would
be
pleas
d
to
send
over
at
the
same
time
his
special
directions
to
apprehend
and
proceed
against
such
a
proceeding
against
the
delinquents
and
gracious
declaration
towards
the
others
would
i
dare
say
have
a
proper
effect
for
securing
the
general
fidelity
of
the
inhabitants
at
least
so
far
as
to
keep
em
from
joining
with
the
enemy
and
least
the
succours
now
sent
to
annapolis
should
not
be
a
sufficient
force
to
dislodge
the
enemy
this
winter
i
would
farther
humbly
propose
it
for
your
graces
consideration
that
his
majesty
s
orders
should
be
forthwith
sent
to
myself
and
the
other
three
governments
of
new
england
that
in
case
the
canadeans
should
not
be
withdrawn
out
of
nova
scotia
they
should
immediately
cause
the
soldiers
rais
d
in
their
respective
colonies
provinces
for
his
majesty
s
service
in
the
expedition
against
canada
to
be
transported
to
annapolis
royal
as
their
place
of
rendezvous
istead
of
louisbourg
to
be
employed
in
driving
the
canadeans
out
of
nova
scotia
and
be
farther
subjected
to
such
orders
as
his
majesty
shall
be
pleas
d
to
signify
in
those
directions
and
if
this
order
was
to
extend
to
the
governour
of
new
york
it
might
not
be
an
unnecessary
caution
i
am
apprehensive
if
such
orders
are
not
sent
that
the
attention
of
the
several
ts
to
the
reduction
of
crown
point
might
very
much
interfere
with
the
preservation
of
nova
scotia
which
is
of
infinitely
more
consequence
these
are
the
things
which
occur
to
me
at
present
which
i
would
submit
to
your
grace
s
consideration
as
what
seems
to
require
more
immediate
dispatch
as
to
the
danger
of
the
french
fleet
s
early
return
from
the
west
indies
to
nova
scotia
and
what
strength
of
ships
may
be
necessary
to
protect
that
province
cape
breton
and
the
other
colonies
against
that
fleet
or
any
other
french
armament
which
may
be
sent
from
europe
in
the
spring
to
visit
these
parts
i
leave
to
admiral
warren
who
now
goes
to
england
in
the
chester
and
with
whom
pursuant
to
the
directions
of
your
grace
s
two
letters
to
me
in
march
april
last
i
have
acted
in
concert
upon
all
such
occasions
as
requir
d
my
consulting
him
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
and
harmony
having
had
the
pleasure
to
find
my
own
sentiments
agreable
to
his
in
all
matters
of
consequence
and
a
most
hearty
disposition
in
him
for
his
majesty
s
service
and
to
whom
i
have
often
talk
d
over
the
affairs
of
nova
scotia
i
will
avoid
repeating
what
i
have
particularly
mention
d
to
your
grace
in
late
letters
concerning
fortifying
of
chebucto
harbour
and
building
a
blockhouse
or
small
fort
for
men
at
menis
with
a
trading
house
there
for
the
indians
and
a
blockhouse
only
at
canso
for
men
instead
of
new
building
and
enlarging
that
at
annapolis
royal
and
erecting
a
larger
fortification
at
canso
which
in
my
humble
opinion
would
greatly
strengthen
that
province
and
together
with
the
introducing
of
french
protestant
ministers
and
english
schools
some
small
encouragement
by
privileges
to
such
as
should
conform
to
the
prtestant
religion
or
send
their
children
to
the
english
schools
and
presents
to
the
indians
with
supplies
of
all
necessaries
for
em
at
the
most
reasonable
rates
in
exchange
for
their
furrs
the
disallowance
of
the
publick
exercise
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
at
least
after
a
short
term
of
years
forbidding
romish
priests
under
severe
penalties
to
come
into
the
country
either
among
the
inhabitants
or
indians
and
if
it
might
be
consistent
with
his
majesty
s
pleasure
a
civil
government
to
be
in
due
time
introduc
d
among
the
inhabitants
these
things
i
say
my
lord
together
with
making
examples
of
the
most
obnoxious
among
the
inhabitants
and
his
majesty
s
extending
his
clemency
and
the
continuance
of
his
protection
to
the
rest
upon
taking
the
proper
oath
of
allegiance
seem
to
me
to
have
the
most
promising
aspect
for
making
good
subjects
of
the
present
generation
of
inhabitants
at
least
better
than
they
are
now
and
good
protestants
of
the
next
generation
of
em
especially
if
there
was
to
be
a
mixture
of
english
or
other
protestants
introduc
d
among
em
which
the
invitation
of
a
civil
government
to
be
set
up
among
em
would
bid
fair
for
doing
and
the
trading
house
would
create
in
the
indians
a
firm
dependance
upon
and
attachment
to
his
majesty
s
government
especially
if
a
proper
protestant
missionary
or
two
was
supported
to
live
among
em
at
their
head
quarters
as
is
the
method
of
the
french
priests
by
ch
means
they
gain
so
great
an
ascendency
over
them
just
as
i
had
finished
the
last
paragraph
a
letter
from
governor
knowles
to
admiral
warren
myself
dated
the
th
instant
was
deliver
d
to
me
in
which
he
informs
me
that
he
has
given
his
opinion
in
his
letters
to
your
grace
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
drive
the
i
suppose
he
means
out
of
accadie
nova
scotia
in
the
spring
and
that
he
hopes
he
shall
have
orders
to
assist
in
doing
it
if
admiral
warren
does
not
go
upon
the
expedition
to
quebeck
which
he
apprehends
is
rendred
more
difficult
than
it
was
by
such
a
number
of
ships
being
got
safe
up
to
quebeck
this
year
as
no
doubt
they
have
carried
all
manner
of
warlike
and
in
his
letter
to
me
of
the
th
of
october
he
says
if
his
majesty
should
be
pleas
d
to
transport
the
rebels
who
are
objects
of
his
mercy
encourage
other
highland
families
to
come
over
he
thinks
the
colony
of
nova
scotia
would
soon
be
repeopled
which
it
is
possible
he
may
have
also
propos
d
to
your
grace
as
in
his
opinion
the
best
method
for
peopling
that
colony
after
the
present
french
inhabitants
are
drove
off
as
the
sentiments
which
i
have
taken
the
liberty
to
offer
to
your
grace
upon
this
subject
happen
to
be
something
different
from
knowles
s
i
think
it
may
not
only
be
proper
but
my
duty
to
mention
the
reasons
of
my
preferring
the
scheme
for
attempting
to
make
the
present
french
inhabitants
good
subjects
to
his
majesty
and
keeping
em
in
the
country
to
that
of
driving
em
off
introducing
some
of
the
rebels
and
other
highlanders
in
their
room
it
seems
very
difficult
to
drive
all
the
inhabitants
of
accadie
out
of
so
large
a
province
as
that
is
and
which
consists
chiefly
of
woods
it
is
most
probable
that
many
of
the
hardiest
men
would
retire
for
some
time
at
least
with
their
cattle
into
the
woods
form
parties
with
the
indians
and
the
remainder
would
doubtless
retreat
with
their
families
to
canada
those
who
are
acquainted
with
the
indian
manner
of
life
making
war
know
that
one
hundred
of
em
under
cover
of
the
woods
can
confine
a
very
large
frontier
within
their
garrisons
even
tho
they
have
companies
continually
scouting
between
one
garrison
and
another
this
is
at
present
the
case
of
this
province
the
other
colonies
of
new
england
new
york
tho
the
people
there
are
us
d
to
the
woods
the
skulking
of
the
indians
behind
the
bushes
in
ditches
with
their
other
wiles
have
large
numbers
of
the
militia
constantly
upon
guard
for
their
protection
their
cattle
is
continually
destroy
d
if
any
of
em
venture
out
into
their
fields
they
are
frequently
kill
d
scalp
d
and
sometimes
not
only
single
families
or
garrisons
are
surpriz
d
and
cut
off
as
has
happen
d
lately
in
this
province
but
even
whole
villages
as
was
the
case
of
sarahtoga
in
new
york
a
few
months
ago
so
that
those
of
the
french
inhabitants
who
should
mix
with
the
indians
in
the
woods
would
have
it
in
their
power
to
put
his
majesty
s
garrison
under
such
circumstances
as
that
it
could
not
possibly
subsist
longer
in
the
country
than
they
could
do
it
without
fresh
provisions
wood
other
materials
supplies
from
thence
from
all
which
they
would
be
wholly
cut
off
when
the
inhabitants
were
drove
away
and
as
to
such
of
the
inhabitants
who
should
go
with
their
families
to
canada
it
must
be
expected
that
a
very
large
body
of
the
men
would
return
arm
d
next
spring
with
some
canadeans
to
join
the
indians
from
all
which
it
seems
justly
to
be
apprehended
that
an
attempt
to
drive
all
the
french
inhabitants
from
their
settlements
should
it
succeed
would
in
effect
be
driving
or
men
to
take
up
arms
against
his
majesty
s
government
there
every
year
during
the
war
make
the
reclaiming
of
the
indians
of
nova
scotia
impracticable
render
it
impossible
for
his
majesty
s
garrison
there
to
subsist
long
in
the
country
in
time
of
war
even
with
the
indians
only
besides
the
addition
of
about
fighting
men
with
their
families
to
canada
which
would
greatly
strengthen
the
french
upon
this
continent
and
would
entail
upon
the
posterity
of
those
who
are
thus
expell
d
for
several
generations
at
least
a
desire
of
recovering
their
former
possessions
in
nova
scotia
seems
to
be
no
inconsiderable
matter
but
what
next
to
the
loss
of
the
country
itself
should
be
avoided
on
the
part
of
his
majesty
is
i
dare
say
an
event
which
the
french
next
to
their
acquisition
of
this
colony
would
desire
it
is
indeed
now
to
be
wish
d
that
general
nicholson
had
upon
the
first
reduction
of
the
colony
to
the
obedience
to
the
crown
of
great
britain
remov
d
the
french
inhabitants
when
they
were
but
a
few
out
of
the
country
as
was
done
at
louisbourg
and
that
during
the
interval
of
peace
the
colony
had
been
planted
with
protestant
subjects
but
after
their
having
remain
d
so
long
in
the
country
upon
the
foot
of
british
subjects
under
the
sanction
of
the
treaty
of
utrecht
and
making
improvements
on
their
lands
for
one
or
two
generations
and
being
grown
up
into
such
a
number
of
families
to
drive
em
all
off
their
settlements
without
farther
inquiry
seems
to
be
liable
to
many
objections
among
others
it
may
be
doubted
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
these
inhabitants
it
would
clearly
appear
to
be
a
just
usage
of
em
it
is
true
that
the
notion
of
their
neutrality
which
seems
to
have
been
entertain
d
for
some
time
by
the
english
as
well
as
themselves
is
and
does
not
comport
with
the
terms
of
their
allegiance
to
his
majesty
to
which
such
of
em
as
chose
to
remain
in
the
province
are
bound
by
the
treaty
of
utrecht
whereby
the
french
king
yielded
up
the
inhabitants
as
well
as
the
soil
of
accadie
and
together
with
their
persons
transferred
their
allegiance
to
the
crown
of
great
britain
but
if
it
is
consider
d
that
this
notion
was
founded
upon
an
act
of
the
late
governour
armstrong
then
the
residing
commander
in
chief
of
the
province
whereby
he
took
upon
himself
to
grant
em
by
a
writing
under
his
hand
an
exemption
from
bearing
arms
upon
any
account
whatever
on
their
consenting
to
take
an
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
present
majesty
which
whether
it
was
done
by
him
with
or
without
authority
appear
d
at
least
to
them
to
be
authentick
it
may
perhaps
be
deem
d
too
rigorous
a
punishment
for
their
behavior
grounded
on
such
a
mistake
to
involve
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
in
the
loss
of
their
estates
and
the
expulsion
of
their
families
out
of
the
country
it
is
not
improbable
but
that
there
may
be
many
among
em
who
would
even
prefer
his
majesty
s
to
a
french
one
have
done
nothing
to
deserve
such
a
forfeiture
some
allowances
may
likewise
be
made
for
their
bad
situation
between
the
canadeans
indians
english
the
ravages
of
all
which
they
have
felt
by
turns
in
the
course
of
the
war
during
which
they
seem
to
have
been
continually
plac
d
between
two
fires
the
force
and
menaces
of
the
canadeans
indians
plundering
em
of
whatever
they
wanted
deterring
em
in
the
strongest
manner
from
having
any
communication
with
his
majesty
s
garrison
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ts
of
the
garrison
for
their
withholding
their
intelligence
supplies
on
the
other
tho
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
in
a
condition
to
protect
em
from
the
enemy
wherefore
it
seems
a
matter
worthy
of
your
grace
s
consideration
whether
under
such
doubtful
circumstances
the
driving
all
the
french
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
off
their
settlements
and
thereby
very
greatly
strengthening
the
enemy
upon
this
continent
not
only
against
the
garrison
in
present
but
finally
against
all
the
british
colonies
there
and
depopulating
one
of
his
majesty
s
provinces
for
some
time
how
long
may
be
uncertain
is
more
eligible
than
treating
em
as
subjects
confining
their
to
the
most
guilty
dangerous
among
em
keeping
the
rest
in
the
country
and
endeavouring
to
make
them
their
posterity
useful
members
of
society
under
his
majesty
s
government
i
can
t
omit
likewise
observing
to
your
grace
that
it
would
be
exceeding
difficult
to
fill
up
the
chasm
which
driving
off
the
inhabitants
would
make
in
the
country
during
the
rupture
with
france
it
would
certainly
be
impracticable
and
i
doubt
whether
it
would
not
be
so
when
peace
shall
be
made
with
france
if
the
indians
should
continue
at
war
with
us
for
what
number
of
families
can
be
propos
d
to
begin
a
in
the
country
after
the
expulsion
of
the
french
inhabitants
with
safety
against
the
indians
which
would
be
continually
expos
d
to
be
destroyed
by
em
whilst
they
were
carrying
on
their
settlements
they
must
expect
no
protection
against
the
indians
from
within
the
garrison
out
of
the
reach
of
their
great
guns
the
company
of
rangers
which
live
without
the
walls
of
the
fort
would
afford
more
of
that
than
a
thousand
garrison
soldiers
would
do
whereas
if
the
stock
of
french
inhabitants
was
continued
in
the
country
an
accommodation
with
the
indians
would
be
more
easily
brought
about
and
preserv
d
they
would
be
a
cover
for
any
number
of
families
that
might
be
introduc
d
among
em
whilst
they
were
carrying
on
settlements
secure
to
the
garrison
its
necessary
supplies
of
fresh
provisions
fuel
materials
for
repairing
the
works
stores
of
sorts
that
the
country
affords
as
to
repeopling
the
province
with
some
of
the
late
rebels
and
other
highland
families
it
seems
much
to
be
doubted
whether
it
might
not
be
too
hazardous
to
fill
that
colony
ch
should
be
the
barrier
of
all
his
majesty
s
colonies
upon
this
continent
with
a
set
of
poor
ignorant
deluded
wretches
just
come
out
of
a
most
unnatural
rebellion
that
from
their
neighbourhood
to
canada
would
be
continually
expos
d
to
the
artifices
and
attempts
of
french
romish
priests
upon
em
who
it
is
reasonable
to
think
would
not
fail
to
instill
the
same
notions
into
em
in
america
which
seduc
d
em
from
their
allegiance
in
great
britain
with
a
promise
of
more
effectual
support
protection
from
the
french
here
than
they
had
in
the
highlands
indeed
my
lord
this
seems
to
be
a
dangerous
experiment
and
what
might
produce
the
worst
of
consequences
i
beg
leave
to
submit
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
whether
the
most
staunch
protestants
families
the
most
zealously
affected
to
his
majesty
s
government
a
number
at
least
of
such
should
not
rather
if
possible
be
transplanted
there
as
soon
as
may
be
i
could
wish
four
or
five
hundred
of
em
could
be
induc
d
to
go
from
some
part
of
new
england
i
think
from
the
experience
i
had
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
province
at
least
upon
the
late
alarm
given
by
the
french
fleet
i
might
safely
venture
to
be
answerable
to
his
majesty
that
if
i
had
suggested
in
my
late
orders
for
assembling
a
body
of
em
under
arms
in
boston
from
all
parts
of
this
province
to
oppose
any
attempt
of
the
enemy
that
there
was
a
design
of
landing
a
son
of
the
pretender
s
here
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
have
kept
any
one
man
who
was
capable
of
marching
hither
from
appearing
under
arms
with
the
most
determin
d
resolution
of
hazarding
his
life
to
the
utmost
in
defence
of
his
majesty
s
and
as
the
late
appearances
of
a
fondness
for
removing
from
hence
to
cape
breton
seem
to
be
quite
vanished
at
present
i
should
not
be
without
hopes
of
some
families
removing
from
these
parts
to
nova
scotia
upon
due
encouragement
protestants
likewise
from
among
the
swiss
cantons
other
northern
parts
in
germany
who
are
generally
bred
up
in
the
exercise
of
arms
and
make
sober
and
industrious
settlers
might
be
safely
trusted
in
accadie
great
numbers
of
em
yearly
flock
into
pensilvania
whereby
the
inhabitants
of
that
province
are
almost
incredibly
increas
d
within
these
twenty
years
and
from
the
behavior
of
the
irish
coming
out
of
the
northern
parts
of
ireland
hither
a
number
of
which
is
setled
in
the
eastern
parts
of
this
province
i
should
think
they
too
might
be
safely
trusted
in
nova
scotia
and
it
is
certain
that
these
poor
unhappy
highlanders
i
mean
such
of
em
as
may
be
design
d
to
be
transported
into
the
plantations
would
be
more
safely
dispos
d
of
among
the
four
ts
of
new
england
or
in
new
york
the
jerseys
where
they
would
not
be
in
danger
either
of
corrupting
the
inhabitants
or
being
again
seduc
d
themselves
but
might
make
useful
subjects
to
his
majesty
i
hope
my
lord
i
shall
be
excus
d
if
i
have
gone
beyond
my
line
in
submitting
these
observations
to
your
grace
at
a
time
when
the
fate
of
one
of
his
majesty
s
northern
colonies
the
most
important
of
em
all
to
the
crown
in
many
respects
as
i
apprehend
and
which
will
be
in
the
hands
of
the
french
the
key
to
all
the
other
british
colonies
upon
this
continent
even
to
cape
breton
and
in
his

possession
the
barrier
of

seems
to
come

boston
new

february
my
lord
duke
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
now
to
acquaint
your
grace
with
the
advices
i
receiv
d
last
night
by
express
from
nova
scotia
giving
me
an
account
that
the
detachment
of
troops
under
the
command
of
colonel
noble
which
i
inform
d
your
grace
in
my
last
of
the
instant
had
taken
possession
of
minas
and
had
kept
it
near
two
months
was
for
want
of
a
proper
security
for
the
men
and
intelligence
from
the
inhabitants
surpriz
d
on
the
of
january
last
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
by
between
canadeans
indians
in
which
noble
with
four
officers
more
and
about
men
were
killed
and
three
officers
and
about
men
were
wounded
and
taken
prisoners
before
it
was
light
enough
for
our
people
to
get
together
they
however
obliged
the
enemy
upwards
of
of
whom
were
kill
d
and
about
wounded
to
allow
em
an
honourable
capitulation
a
copy
of
which
i
inclose
to
your
grace
together
with
the
account
given
of
this
affair
by
the
officer
who
was
commandant
of
the
detachment
at
the
time
of
the
capitulation
extracts
from
governour
mascarene
s
letter
to
me
upon
this
subject
from
whence
i
choose
your
grace
should
receive
the
in
the
same
light
it
has
been
conveyed
to
me
in
and
which
upon
the
best
inquiry
i
can
make
seems
to
be
a
just
one
i
also
inclose
to
your
grace
an
extract
from
noble
s
letter
to
me
dated
two
days
before
his
death
giving
me
an
account
of
the
situation
of
affairs
then
at
minas
from
whence
your
grace
will
perceive
that
even
then
he
was
in
expectation
of
being
join
d
by
the
rhode
island
forces
the
company
from
this
province
which
had
the
misfortune
to
be
shipreck
d
and
that
had
they
arriv
d
at
annapolis
and
the
new
hampshire
companies
had
not
return
d
home
without
acting
the
enemy
would
in
all
probability
have
been
drove
out
of
nova
scotia
and
every
good
purpose
which
i
had
propos
d
been
answer
d
before
this
time
as
it
is
i
shall
use
my
best
endeavours
forthwith
to
fit
out
a
sufficient
force
by
sea
to
destroy
ramsay
s
vessels
at
schiegnecto
and
recover
our
own
by
spring
to
send
mascarene
such
a
reinforcement
of
troops
as
may
still
drive
the
enemy
out
of
nova
scotia
by
the
same
time
and
prevent
any
bad
consequences
from
the
late
accident
there
which
seems
necessary
to
be
done
if
possible
and
i
shall
hope
to
succeed
in
if
the
neighbouring
governments
of
new
england
will
assist
in
which
i
shall
urge
em
to
do
i
likewise
inclose
the
answer
of
the
inhabitants
of
minas
to
the
french
letter
which
i
some
time
ago
inform
d
your
grace
i
sent
mascarene
last
fall
and
a
paragraph
out
of
one
of
his
letters
to
me
upon
the
same
matter
whereby
your
grace
will
perceive
that
that
letter
seems
to
have
had
an
happy
effect
upon
the
inhabitants
at
a
most
critical
conjuncture
the
late
secresy
of
the
inhabitants
of
minas
with
regard
to
the
enemys
motions
and
the
very
certain
intelligence
which
the
enemy
gain
d
of
the
particular
quarters
of
the
english
officers
notwithstanding
their
supplying
the
king
s
troops
with
provisions
and
the
curtesy
of
their
behavior
to
em
before
this
surprize
and
their
professions
of
being
sorry
for
it
afterwards
seems
to
shew
the
necessity
of
his
majesty
s
keeping
a
strong
blockhouse
there
with
a
garrison
of
men
and
the
constant
ill
behavior
of
the
inhabitants
of
schiegnecto
seems
to
make
another
blockhouse
with
a
like
garrison
there
equally
necessary
as
i
at
first
propos
d
to
your
grace
from
louisbourg
and
these
two
with
a
fort
and
garrison
at
chebucto
of
men
at
least
and
the
continuance
of
a
garrison
of
at
annapolis
royal
as
it
is
at
present
with
a
strong
blockhouse
at
canso
garrison
d
with
men
would
through
the
constant
correspondence
that
might
be
kept
up
between
the
several
garrisons
be
an
effectual
security
to
the
province
against
the
enemy
and
oblige
the
inhabitants
in
a
little
time
to
contribute
towards
the
protection
expence
of
the
government
and
for
ever
frustrate
any
hopes
the
french
could
entertain
of
making
themselves
masters
of
it
by
their
constant
endeavours
to
seduce
the
inhabitants
from
their
allegiance
all
which
would
make
nova
scotia
really
his
majesty
s
which
it
seems
scarcely
to
have
been
yet
and
i
would
submit
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
whether
a
company
of
rangers
consisting
of
indians
or
rather
two
companies
consisting
of
each
one
to
be
posted
at
the
blockhouse
at
minas
and
the
other
in
schiegnecto
would
not
be
of
the
greatest
service
in
scouting
thro
every
part
of
the
province
and
in
the
woods
upon
all
emergencies
for
which
the
regular
troops
are
by
no
means
fit
and
particularly
in
preventing
the
french
from
introducing
men
from
canada
into
the
province
by
the
bay
vert
i
think
the
great
service
which
colonel
gorham
s
company
of
rangers
has
been
of
to
the
garrison
at
annapolis
royal
is
a
demonstration
of
the
usefulness
of
such
a
corps
besides
that
it
may
be
a
means
of
bringing
indians
out
of
the
french
interest
into
his
majesty
s
service
and
go
far
towards
reclaiming
em
in
general
especially
if
as
i
have
before
propos
d
for
your
grace
s
consideration
two
trading
or
truck
houses
were
to
be
maintain
d
one
at
minas
and
the
other
at
chiegnecto
for
supplying
the
indians
with
all
necessaries
in
exchange
for
furrs
and
proper
presents
were
made
to
em
in
the
manner
which
the
french
use
to
keep
em
in
their
interest
and
if
your
grace
would
allow
me
the
freedom
to
offer
my
sentiments
concerning
what
appears
to
me
to
be
farther
necessary
for
putting
this
important
province
of
nova
scotia
i
think
i
may
justly
call
it
the
most
important
to
the
crown
of
any
upon
this
continent
in
security
i
sho
d
propose
one
of
his
majesty
s
arm
d
sloops
or
snows
with
a
tender
to
be
constantly
employ
d
in
the
bay
of
fundy
for
visiting
all
parts
of
it
upon
every
occasion
as
well
as
the
several
harbours
on
the
cape
sable
coast
and
one
of
his
majesty
s
frigates
to
be
employ
d
for
the
protection
of
the
fishery
at
canso
as
was
always
usual
in
time
of
peace
which
together
with
a
tender
would
also
be
of
great
service
in
duly
attending
the
bay
verte
upon
every
occasion
and
likewise
visiting
the
coast
of
accadie
or
cape
sables
besides
protecting
the
fishery
since
writing
the
last
paragraph
i
have
heard
of
some
other
particular
circumstances
which
make
it
very
suspicious
that
several
of
the
inhabitants
at
least
of
minas
knew
of
the
enemy
s
motions
i
find
that
it
is
the
general
opinion
of
the
officers
that
they
did

the
most
dutiful

since
finishing

joint
letter

have

from
one
of
the
english
prisoners
just
arriv

from

in
exchange
for
one
of
the
french
prisoners
sent
by
me
from
boston
and
who
was
carry
d
captive
from
minas
where
he
was
taken
by
the
enemy
in
the
late
surprize
that
when
the
canadeans
went
from
minas
to
schiegnecto
they
march
d
out
of
the
grand
prè

were
reduc

schiegnecto
by
several
of
their

s
leaving
em
at
every
great
village
in
minas
thro
which
they
pass
d
which
makes
it
evident
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
that
district
had
join
d
the
canadeans
in
their
late
attack
upon
the
english
at
grand
prè
and
may
serve
farther
to
shew
your

the
imminent
danger
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
minas
s
still
joining
the
enemy
unless
speedy
measures
are
taken
for
driving
the
canadeans
out
of
the
country
and
securing
the
fidelity
of
the
inhabitants
in
some
better
manner
than
it
is
at
present
and
how
opportunely
the
forces
sent
last
winter
from
hence

annapolis

the
assurances

took

of
sending

behav

s
protection
in
their

arriv
d
there
for
saving
the
whole
district
of
minas
from
an
open
revolt
this
fluctuating
state
of
the
inhabitants
of
accadie
seems
my
lord
naturally
to
arise
from
their
finding
a
want
of
due
protection
from
his
majesty
s
government
and
their
apprehensions
that
the
french
will
soon
be
masters
of
the
province
which
their
repeated
attempts
every
year
for
the
reduction
of
his

at

royal
and
the
appearance
of
the
late
duke
d
anville
s
squadron
from
france
upon
their
coast
with
that
view
strongly
impress
upon
em
as
does
also
the
residence
of
the
enemy
in
the
province
and
the
sollicitations
of
their
own
priests
and
to
this
i
believe
may
be
added
some
jealousy
which
the
enemy
and
priests
are
for
ever
instilling
into
em
that
the
english
want
only
a
safe
opportunity
of
driving
all
the
french
inhabitants
off
their
settlements
which
tho
mascarene
assures
me
that
his
communicating
to
em
my
printed
letter
promising
em
his
majesty
s
protection
had
so
far
allay
d
as
together
with
the
arrival
of
the
late
detachment
of
soldiers
sent
from
hence
in
the
winter
for
the
defence
protection
of
the
province
to
disappoint
de
ramsay
s
attempt
upon
the
inhabitants
of
minas
for
bringing
em
to
an
open
revolt
and
to
make
him
retire
from
minas
to
schiegnecto
yet
as
the
hopes
my
letter
may
have
made
em
entertain
have
not
been
yet
confirm
d
by
assurances
of
his
majesty
s
royal
protection
directly
from
england
i
cant
but
think
there
is
a
most
apparant
danger
of
nova
scotia
s
being
soon
lost
if
the
expedition
against
canada
should
not
proceed
this
year
nor
any
measures
be
taken
or
particular
orders
be
sent
by
his
majesty
for
securing
the
province
against
the
enemy
strengthening
his
government
among
the
inhabitants
for
i
perceive
that
the
general
assembly
of
this
province
from
whence
only
the
succours
support
which
his
majesty
s
garrison
at
annapolis
royal
has
hitherto
received
for
the
protection
defence
of
nova
scotia
have
been
sent
are
tir
d
of
having
em
drawn
wholly
from
their
own
people
and
despair
of
its
being
effectual
without
his
majesty
s
more
immediate
interposition
for
the
protection
of
that
province
and
i
look
upon
it
as
a
very
happy
incident
that
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
send
mascarene
the
support
i
did
the
last
winter
and
beginning
of
the
spring
out
of
the
levies
rais
d
for
the
expedition
against
canada
which
i
insisted
upon
doing
as
they
were
in
his
majesty
s
pay
tho
rais
d
for
another
service
but
should
not
have
been
able
to
do
it
i
believe
had
it
depended
wholly
upon
the
consent
of
the
assembly
tho
generally
well
dispos
d
for
his
majesty
s
newcastle
to
shirley
may
as
you
and
warren
have
represented
that
an
opinion
prevailed
amongst
the
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
that
it
was
intended
to
remove
them
from
their
settlements
and
habitations
in
that
province
and
as
that
report
may
probably
have
been
artfully
spread
amongst
them
in
order
to
induce
them
to
withdraw
themselves
from
their
allegiance
to
his
majesty
and
to
take
part
with
the
enemy
his
majesty
thinks
it
necessary
that
proper
measures
should
be
taken
to
remove
any
such
suggestions
and
for
that
purpose
it
is
the
king
s
pleasure
that
you
should
declare
in
some
publick
and
authentick
manner
to
his
majesty
s
subjects
inhabitants
of
that
province
that
there
is
not
the
least
foundation
for
any
apprehension
of
that
nature
but
that
on
the
contrary
it
is
his
majesty
s
resolution
to
protect
and
maintain
all
such
of
them
as
shall
continue
in
their
duty
and
allegiance
to
his
majesty
in
the
quiet
peaceable
possession
of
their
respective
habitations
and
settlements
and
that
they
shall
continue
to
enjoy
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
his
majesty
did
propose
to
have
signed
a
proclamation
to
the
purport
above
mentioned
and
to
have
transmitted
it
to
you
to
have
been
published
in
nova
scotia
but
as
the
advices
that
have
been
received
here
of
a
body
of
the
new
england
troops
which
were
advanced
to
menis
having
been
surprised
by
a
party
of
the
french
canadeans
and
their
indians
and
having
been
either
cut
off
or
taken
prisoners
and
the
great
probability
there
is
that
this
misfortune
could
not
have
happened
to
that
body
of
troops
without
the
assistance
or
at
least
connivance
of
the
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
make
it
very
difficult
to
fix
the
terms
of
the
intended
proclamation
his
majesty
thinks
it
more
advisable
to
leave
it
to
you
to
make
such
a
declaration
in
his
name
as
you
shall
be
of
opinion
the
present
circumstances
of
the
province
may
shirley
to
newcastle
june
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
my
letters
which
i
have
lately
transmitted
to
your
grace
except
that
de
ramsay
is
still
at
chiegnecto
with
his
party
in
expectation
of
a
reinforcement
from
canada
and
the
arrival
of
an
armament
from
france
and
that
he
has
not
thought
fit
to
venture
again
to
manis
but
insists
in
his
messages
to
the
inhabitants
there
that
they
should
look
upon
themselves
as
subjects
to
the
french
king
since
the
new
england
troops
were
oblig
d
to
retire
out
of
their
district
by
capitulation
but
that
this
has
had
no
effect
upon
the
inhabitants
the
reinforcement
which
i
sent
there
afterwards
having
taken
repossession
of
manis
and
hoisted
the
king
s
flagg
there
and
the
deputies
of
manis
having
thereupon
renew
d
their
oaths
of
fidelity
to
his
majesty
at
annapolis
royal
i
continue
the
last
reinforcement
at
the
garrison
still
for
the
security
of
that
and
manis
but
it
is
not
strong
enough
to
drive
the
french
from
schiegnecto
it
being
suspected
that
the
inhabitants
of
that
district
who
were
ever
refractory
to
his
majesty
s
government
would
not
scruple
to
join
the
enemy
in
case
of
an
attack
upon
em
and
i
could
not
think
it
adviseable
for
me
to
send
all
the
forces
which
i
had
rais
d
for
the
expedition
against
canada
within
this
government
upon
another
service
as
i
must
have
done
to
have
been
strong
enough
to
force
the
enemy
out
of
schiegnecto
after
the
action
at
minas
when
i
was
in
daily
expectation
of
receiving
his
majesty
s
commands
concerning
the
prosecution
of
the
intended
expedition
and
besides
the
assembly
which
has
been
at
a
great
expence
for
the
raising
of
the
men
for
the
service
of
the
expedition
only
strongly
insisted
upon
my
reserving
of
em
to
go
against
crown
point
as
your
grace
will
perceive
by
the
inclos
d
copy
of
their
answer
to
my
message
however
the
several
reinforcements
which
i
did
send
to
annapolis
have
preserv
d
the
garrison
and
province
from
falling
into
the
enemys
hands
the
last
year
and
not
only
made
the
enemy
quit
manis
but
still
confine
em
to
schiegnecto
and
had
the
rhode
island
new
hampshire
troops
join
d
the
massachusetts
forces
at
manis
as
was
propos
d
and
both
those
governments
promis
d
me
they
should
and
one
of
the
massachusetts
companies
had
not
been
lost
in
their
passage
we
should
have
been
strong
enough
i
am
perswaded
to
have
drove
the
enemy
the
last
winter
quite
out
of
the
province
of
nova
scotia
as
it
is
i
doubt
not
if
no
armament
arrives
from
france
we
shall
be
able
to
keep
em
out
of
annapolis
and
manis
till
i
receive
his
majesty
s
commands
which
i
am
in
daily
expectation
of
and
will
i
hope
enable
me
to
take
effectual
measures
for
getting
rid
of
the
enemy
and
securing
the
province
against
their
attempts
for
the
shirley
to
newcastle
boston
june
my
lord
duke
since
my
last
to
your
grace
i
have
accounts
from
nova
scotia
that
the
french
have
rais
d
a
battery
of
nine
guns
on
the
back
of
schiegnecto
to
oppose
the
landing
of
forces
from
bay
verte
that
they
were
also
building
a
fort
had
landed
cannon
mortars
there
which
they
were
now
hawling
by
land
and
may
use
either
for
fortifying
that
district
or
transport
from
thence
to
annapolis
royal
for
the
reduction
of
his
majesty
s
garrison
there
has
been
likewise
further
accounts
from
thence
that
the
inhabitants
were
in
expectation
of
men
from
canada
which
together
with
the
indians
people
of
schiegnecto
some
of
manis
it
is
said
would
make
up
de
ramsay
s
party
who
were
then
to
proceed
against
annapolis
and
that
three
large
french
ships
of
force
had
been
seen
in
bay
verte
two
from
canada
one
from
france
and
landed
troops
stores
these
accounts
gain
credit
the
more
easily
as
it
seems
not
to
be
doubted
but
that
the
french
have
the
reduction
of
nova
scotia
extremely
at
heart
and
will
be
continually
making
some
attempt
or
other
against
it
whilst
the
warr
lasts
and
i
am
sorry
to
find
by
a
message
lately
sent
me
from
the
assembly
desiring
i
would
recall
the
soldiers
i
last
sent
to
annapolis
that
they
seem
out
of
heart
about
the
effectual
preservation
of
it
from
the
enemy
should
the
french
gain
it
by
any
sudden
stroke
i
am
perswaded
they
would
be
so
strong
there
by
the
addition
of
all
the
inhabitants
to
their
other
forces
as
well
as
the
numbers
they
would
draw
from
canada
by
immediate
fortifications
of
it
that
it
would
require
a
very
considerable
armament
number
of
troops
to
recover
it
from
em
which
makes
me
think
it
my
indispensable
duty
to
trouble
your
grace
with
so
frequent
a
repetition
of
my
apprehensions
concerning
it
the
enemy
may
indeed
be
now
look
d
upon
as
masters
of
scheignecto
which
place
it
is
evident
they
are
busy
in
fortifying
would
have
been
so
likewise
of
manis
by
this
time
had
they
not
been
oblig
d
to
withdraw
their
troops
from
thence
last
fall
by
the
arrival
of
the
detachments
i
sent
shirley
to
newcastle
july
i
shall
now
take
the
liberty
to
submit
to
your
grace
s
consideration
the
most
practicable
scheme
that
occurs
to
me
at
present
for
effectually
driving
keeping
the
canadeans
out
of
nova
scotia
if
knowles
when
the
season
is
too
far
advanc
d
for
the
french
to
make
an
attempt
from
france
against
louisbourg
should
detach
men
out
of
that
garrison
to
be
join
d
by
from
new
england
at
annapolis
royal
and
from
thence
to
proceed
to
schiegnecto
that
force
would
i
apprehend
drive
the
enemy
off
and
easily
make
us
masters
of
all
the
inhabitants
of
that
district
who
seem
to
have
ever
been
so
deeply
engaged
on
the
side
of
the
enemy
as
to
make
em
forfeit
all
pretence
of
right
to
hold
their
possessions
and
if
the
new
england
men
were
to
share
among
em
that
district
upon
condition
of
their
setling
there
with
their
families
in
such
a
defensible
manner
as
they
should
be
directed
to
do
and
the
french
inhabitants
of
that
district
were
to
be
transplanted
into
new
england
and
distributed
among
the
four
governments
there
that
i
apprehend
might
be
a
settlement
of
the
district
of
schiegnecto
strong
enough
to
keep
the
canadeans
out
and
to
defend
themselves
against
the
indians
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
other
districts
of
nova
scotia
menis
annapolis
being
thus
lock
d
up
between
the
settlement
in
schiegnecto
at
one
end
and
his
majesty
s
garrison
at
the
other
and
aw
d
by
the
removal
of
the
french
inhabitants
of
schiegnecto
from
off
their
lands
would
be
constantly
held
to
their
good
behaviour
and
by
intermarriages
the
spreading
of
the
english
settlement
from
schiegnecto
the
whole
province
or
at
least
the
greatest
part
of
it
might
in
two
or
three
generations
become
english
protestants
i
would
add
that
such
an
exchange
of
the
present
inhabitants
of
schiegnecto
for
new
england
men
would
make
up
to
the
four
colonies
of
new
england
the
loss
of
the
families
propos
d
to
be
remov
d
from
thence
to
nova
scotia
upon
this
occasion
hinder
canada
s
being
strengthened
by
the
expulsion
of
the
french
from
their
possessions
prevent
the
english
settlement
at
schiegnecto
from
being
harrass
d
by
their
continual
attempts
to
recover
their
former
lands
and
the
encouragement
given
to
the
new
england
men
by
the
propos
d
distribution
of
the
lands
among
em
would
besides
make
the
raising
of
men
for
this
service
much
more
practicable
less
expensive
to
the
crown
upon
the
whole
my
lord
if
the
war
continues
unless
some
measures
are
very
suddenly
taken
for
the
better
security
of
nova
scotia
there
seems
to
be
great
danger
that
that
province
will
not
long
remain

to

the
general
inclination
which
the
french
inhabitants
of
nova
scotia
have
to
the
french
interest
proceeds
from
their
ties
of
consanguinity
to
the
french
of
canada
but
more
especially
from
those
of
their
religion
which
last
seems
to
put
em
greatly
under
the
influence
of
their
priests
who
continually
receive
their
directions
from
the
bishop
of
quebeck
are
the
instruments
by
which
the
governour
of
canada
makes
all
his
attempts
for
the
reduction
of
the
province
to
the
french
crown
keeps
the
indians
of
nova
scotia
commonly
called
the
cape
sable
indians
in
their
dependence
upon
him
particular
instances
of
which
may
be
given
in
the
first
body
of
french
indians
which
attack
d
the
king
s
garrison
soon
after
the
declaration
of
the
present
war
s
being
headed
by
a
priest
of

the
correspondence
between

and
nova
scotia
assembling
cape
sable
indians
influencing
such
of
the
inhabitants
as
had
joined
with
or
assisted
the
enemy
has
been
manag
d
by
another
priest
of
that
province
other
instances
of
this
kind
might
be
given
as
particularly
the
attempt
to
bring
the
inhabitants
into
revolt
soon
after
the
late
surprize
at
menis
by
endeavouring
to
influence
em
with
the
authority
of
the
bishop
of
quebeck
pronouncing
em
to
be
free
from
their
oath
of
allegiance
to
his
majesty
but
i
shall
content
myself
with
observing
to
your
grace
only
one
piece
of
policy
made
use
of
by
the
french
priests
in
nova
scotia
for
preserving
the
whole
body
of
the
people
intirely
french
and
roman
catholick
s
forbidding
all
intermarriages
with
the
english
under
pain
of
excommunication
of
which
i
am
informed
there
has
been
one
or
two
late
instances
in
actual
excommunication
upon
this
occasion
which
has
had
so
general
an
effect
as
to
prevent
the
settlement
of
any
one
english
family
within
the
province
from
the
first
reduction
of
it
to
the
present
time
tho
some
have
attempted
to
setle
in
the
country
to
keep
out
between
the
french
his
majesty
s
english
subjects
as
that
i
never
heard
of
any
one
instance
besides
the
before
mentioned
ones
and
i
would
humbly
submit
it
to
your
grace
s
consideration
if
the
free
exercise
of
the
roman
catholick
religion
and
an
unlimited
toleration
of
roman
priests
in
nova
scotia
should
continue
to
have
the
same
effect
in
that
colony
for
the
next
succeeding
forty
years
as
it
has
had
within
these
last
forty
the
inhabitants
there
are
suffer
d
to
remain
a
distinct
body
of
french
in
the
neighbourhood
of
canada
with
the
ties
of
consanguinity
religion
between
the
canadeans
still
growing

as

there

controuling
the
pernicious
power
of

over
the

the

of

province
which
may
possibly
be
cut
off

pleas
d
to

terms
of

declaration
which
he
has
commanded
me
to

in

to

whereby
it
became
my
duty
to
avoid
every
thing
in

which
appear
d
to
me
to
have
a
tendency
to
disserve

within
