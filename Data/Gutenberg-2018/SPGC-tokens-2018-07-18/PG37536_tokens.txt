introduction
the
russian
nation
is
a
new
and
wonderful
phenomenon
in
the
history
of
mankind
the
character
of
the
people
differs
to
such
a
degree
from
that
of
the
other
europeans
that
their
neighbours
find
it
impossible
to
diagnose
them
this
affirmation
by
dostoïeffsky
the
prophetic
journalist
offers
a
key
to
the
treatment
in
his
novels
of
the
troubles
and
aspirations
of
his
race
he
wrote
with
a
sacramental
fervour
whether
he
was
writing
as
a
personal
agent
or
an
impersonal
novelist
or
journalist
hence
his
rage
with
the
calmer
men
more
gracious
interpreters
of
the
modern
sclav
who
like
ivan
tourguenieff
were
able
to
see
russia
on
a
line
with
the
western
nations
or
to
consider
her
maternal
throes
from
the
disengaged
safe
retreat
of
an
exile
in
paris
not
so
was
to
be
given
her
new
literature
in
the
eyes
of
dostoïeffsky
strained
with
watching
often
red
with
tears
and
anger
those
other
nations
he
said
proudly
looking
for
the
symptoms
of
the
in
his
own
those
other
nations
of
europe
may
maintain
that
they
have
at
heart
a
common
aim
and
a
common
ideal
in
fact
they
are
divided
among
themselves
by
a
thousand
interests
territorial
or
other
each
pulls
his
own
way
with
determination
it
would
seem
that
every
individual
nation
aspires
to
the
discovery
of
the
universal
ideal
for
humanity
and
is
bent
on
attaining
that
ideal
by
force
of
its
own
unaided
strength
hence
he
argued
each
european
nation
is
an
enemy
to
its
own
welfare
and
that
of
the
world
in
general
to
this
very
disassociation
he
attributed
without
quite
understanding
the
rest
of
us
our
not
understanding
the
russian
people
and
our
taxing
them
with
a
lack
of
personality
we
failed
to
perceive
their
rare
synthetic
power
that
faculty
of
the
russian
mind
to
read
the
aspirations
of
the
whole
of
human
kind
among
his
own
folk
he
avowed
we
would
find
none
of
the
imperviousness
the
intolerance
of
the
average
european
the
russian
adapts
himself
with
ease
to
the
play
of
contemporary
thought
and
has
no
difficulty
in
assimilating
any
new
idea
he
sees
where
it
will
help
his
and
where
it
fails
to
be
of
value
he
divines
the
process
by
which
ideas
even
the
most
divergent
the
most
hostile
to
one
another
may
meet
and
blend
possibly
recognising
this
dostoïeffsky
was
the
more
concerned
not
to
be
too
far
depolarised
or
say
in
his
own
works
of
fiction
but
in
truth
he
had
no
need
to
fear
any
weakening
of
his
natural
fibre
and
racial
proclivities
or
of
the
authentic
utterance
wrung
out
of
him
by
the
hard
and
cruel
thongs
of
experience
we
see
the
rigorous
sincerity
of
his
record
again
in
the
sheer
autobiography
contained
in
the
present
work
house
of
the
it
was
in
the
fatal
winter
of
when
he
was
with
many
others
mostly
very
young
men
like
himself
sentenced
to
death
for
his
liberal
political
propaganda
a
sentence
which
was
at
the
last
moment
commuted
to
imprisonment
in
the
siberian
prisons
out
of
that
terror
which
turned
youth
grey
was
distilled
the
terrible
reality
of
house
of
the
if
one
would
truly
fathom
how
deep
that
reality
is
and
what
its
phenomenon
in
literature
amounts
to
one
should
turn
again
to
that
favourite
idyllic
book
of
youth
by
my
countrywoman
mme
cottin
or
the
exiles
of
and
compare
for
example
the
typical
scene
of
sleep
in
the
wooden
chapel
in
the
snow
where
she
ought
to
have
been
frozen
to
death
but
fared
very
comfortably
with
the
siberian
actuality
of
dostoïeffsky
but
he
was
no
idyllist
though
he
could
be
tender
as
mme
cottin
herself
what
he
felt
about
these
things
you
can
tell
from
his
stories
if
a
more
explicit
statement
in
the
theoretic
side
be
asked
of
him
take
this
plain
avowal
from
his
confession
books
of
there
is
no
denying
that
the
people
are
morally
ill
with
a
grave
although
not
a
mortal
malady
one
to
which
it
is
difficult
to
assign
a
name
may
we
call
it
unsatisfied
thirst
for
truth
the
people
are
seeking
eagerly
and
untiringly
for
truth
and
for
the
ways
that
lead
to
it
but
hitherto
they
have
failed
in
their
search
after
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
this
great
longing
for
truth
appeared
among
the
people
for
truth
perfect
and
entire
and
with
it
the
resurrection
of
civic
life
there
was
a
clamouring
for
a
gospel
new
ideas
and
feelings
became
manifest
and
a
great
hope
rose
up
among
the
people
believing
that
these
great
changes
were
precursors
of
a
state
of
things
which
never
came
to
pass
there
is
the
accent
of
his
hope
and
his
despair
let
it
prove
to
you
the
conviction
with
which
he
wrote
these
tragic
pages
one
that
is
affecting
at
this
moment
the
destiny
of
russia
and
the
spirit
of
us
who
watch
her

ten
years
a
convict
in
the
midst
of
the
steppes
of
the
mountains
of
the
impenetrable
forests
of
the
desert
regions
of
siberia
one
meets
from
time
to
time
with
little
towns
of
a
thousand
or
two
inhabitants
built
entirely
of
wood
very
ugly
with
two
churches
one
in
the
centre
of
the
town
the
other
in
the
cemetery
in
a
word
towns
which
bear
much
more
resemblance
to
a
village
in
the
suburbs
of
moscow
than
to
a
town
properly
so
called
in
most
cases
they
are
abundantly
provided
with
assessors
and
other
inferior
officials
if
it
is
cold
in
siberia
the
great
advantages
of
the
government
service
compensate
for
it
the
inhabitants
are
simple
people
without
liberal
ideas
their
manners
are
antique
solid
and
unchanged
by
time
the
officials
who
form
and
with
reason
the
nobility
in
siberia
either
belong
to
the
country
siberians
or
they
have
arrived
there
from
russia
the
latter
come
straight
from
the
capitals
tempted
by
the
high
pay
the
extra
allowance
for
travelling
expenses
and
by
hopes
not
less
seductive
for
the
future
those
who
know
how
to
resolve
the
problem
of
life
remain
almost
always
in
siberia
the
abundant
and
fruit
which
they
gather
there
recompenses
them
amply
for
what
they
lose
as
for
the
others
persons
who
are
unable
to
deal
with
the
problem
they
are
soon
bored
in
siberia
and
ask
themselves
with
regret
why
they
committed
the
folly
of
coming
they
impatiently
kill
the
three
years
which
they
are
obliged
by
rule
to
remain
and
as
soon
as
their
time
is
up
they
beg
to
be
sent
back
and
return
to
their
original
quarters
running
down
siberia
and
ridiculing
it
they
are
wrong
for
it
is
a
happy
country
not
only
as
regards
the
government
service
but
also
from
many
other
points
of
view
the
climate
is
excellent
the
merchants
are
rich
and
hospitable
the
europeans
in
easy
circumstances
are
numerous
as
for
the
young
girls
they
are
like
roses
and
their
morality
is
irreproachable
game
is
to
be
found
in
the
streets
and
throws
itself
upon
the
sportsman
gun
people
drink
champagne
in
prodigious
quantities
the
caviare
is
astonishingly
good
and
most
abundant
in
a
word
it
is
a
blessed
land
out
of
which
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
able
to
make
profit
and
much
profit
is
really
made
it
is
in
one
of
these
little
towns
gay
and
perfectly
satisfied
with
themselves
the
population
of
which
has
left
upon
me
the
most
agreeable
impression
that
i
met
an
exile
alexander
petrovitch
goriantchikoff
formerly
a
landed
proprietor
in
russia
he
had
been
condemned
to
hard
labour
of
the
second
class
for
assassinating
his
wife
after
undergoing
his
punishment
ten
years
of
hard
labour
he
lived
quietly
and
unnoticed
as
a
colonist
in
the
little
town
of
k
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
inscribed
in
one
of
the
surrounding
districts
but
he
resided
at
k
where
he
managed
to
get
a
living
by
giving
lessons
to
children
in
the
towns
of
siberia
one
often
meets
with
exiles
who
are
occupied
with
instruction
they
are
not
looked
down
upon
for
they
teach
the
french
language
so
necessary
in
life
and
of
which
without
them
one
would
not
in
the
distant
parts
of
siberia
have
the
least
idea
i
saw
alexander
petrovitch
the
first
time
at
the
house
of
an
official
ivan
ivanitch
gvosdikof
a
venerable
old
man
very
hospitable
and
the
father
of
five
daughters
of
whom
the
greatest
hopes
were
entertained
four
times
a
week
alexander
petrovitch
gave
them
lessons
at
the
rate
of
thirty
kopecks
silver
a
lesson
his
external
appearance
interested
me
he
was
excessively
pale
and
thin
still
young
about
years
of
age
short
and
weak
always
very
neatly
dressed
in
the
european
style
when
you
spoke
to
him
he
looked
at
you
in
a
very
attentive
manner
listening
to
your
words
with
strict
politeness
and
with
a
reflective
air
as
though
you
had
placed
before
him
a
problem
or
wished
to
extract
from
him
a
secret
he
replied
clearly
and
shortly
but
in
doing
so
weighed
each
word
so
that
one
felt
ill
at
ease
without
knowing
why
and
was
glad
when
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
i
put
some
questions
to
ivan
gvosdikof
in
regard
to
him
he
told
me
that
goriantchikoff
was
of
irreproachable
morals
otherwise
gvosdikof
would
not
have
entrusted
him
with
the
education
of
his
children
but
that
he
was
a
terrible
misanthrope
who
kept
apart
from
all
society
that
he
was
very
learned
a
great
reader
and
that
he
spoke
but
little
and
never
entered
freely
into
a
conversation
certain
persons
told
him
that
he
was
mad
but
that
was
not
looked
upon
as
a
very
serious
defect
accordingly
the
most
important
persons
in
the
town
were
ready
to
treat
alexander
petrovitch
with
respect
for
he
could
be
useful
to
them
in
writing
petitions
it
was
believed
that
he
was
well
connected
in
russia
perhaps
among
his
relations
there
were
some
who
were
highly
placed
but
it
was
known
that
since
his
exile
he
had
broken
off
all
relations
with
them
in
a
word
he
injured
himself
every
one
knew
his
story
and
was
aware
that
he
had
killed
his
wife
through
jealousy
less
than
a
year
after
his
marriage
and
that
he
had
given
himself
up
to
justice
which
had
made
his
punishment
much
less
severe
such
crimes
are
always
looked
upon
as
misfortunes
which
must
be
treated
with
pity
nevertheless
this
original
kept
himself
obstinately
apart
and
never
showed
himself
except
to
give
lessons
in
the
first
instance
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
then
without
knowing
why
i
found
myself
interested
by
him
he
was
rather
enigmatic
to
talk
with
him
was
quite
impossible
certainly
he
replied
to
all
my
questions
he
seemed
to
make
it
a
duty
to
do
so
but
when
once
he
had
answered
i
was
afraid
to
interrogate
him
any
longer
after
such
conversations
one
could
observe
on
his
countenance
signs
of
suffering
and
exhaustion
i
remember
that
one
fine
summer
evening
i
went
out
with
him
from
the
house
of
ivan
gvosdikof
it
suddenly
occurred
to
me
to
invite
him
to
come
in
with
me
and
smoke
a
cigarette
i
can
scarcely
describe
the
fright
which
showed
itself
in
his
countenance
he
became
confused
muttered
incoherent
words
and
suddenly
after
looking
at
me
with
an
angry
air
took
to
flight
in
an
opposite
direction
i
was
very
much
astonished
afterwards
when
he
met
me
he
seemed
to
experience
on
seeing
me
a
sort
of
terror
but
i
did
not
lose
courage
there
was
something
in
him
which
attracted
me
a
month
afterwards
i
went
to
see
petrovitch
without
any
pretext
it
is
evident
that
in
doing
so
i
behaved
foolishly
and
without
the
least
delicacy
he
lived
at
one
of
the
extreme
points
of
the
town
with
an
old
woman
whose
daughter
was
in
a
consumption
the
latter
had
a
little
child
about
ten
years
old
very
pretty
and
very
lively
when
i
went
in
alexander
petrovitch
was
seated
by
her
side
and
was
teaching
her
to
read
when
he
saw
me
he
became
confused
as
if
i
had
detected
him
in
a
crime
losing
all
he
suddenly
stood
up
and
looked
at
me
with
awe
and
astonishment
then
we
both
of
us
sat
down
he
followed
attentively
all
my
looks
as
if
i
had
suspected
him
of
some
mysterious
intention
i
understood
he
was
horribly
mistrustful
he
looked
at
me
as
a
sort
of
spy
and
he
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
saying
are
you
not
soon
going
away
i
spoke
to
him
of
our
little
town
of
the
news
of
the
day
but
he
was
silent
or
smiled
with
an
air
of
displeasure
i
could
see
that
he
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
all
that
was
taking
place
in
the
town
and
that
he
was
in
no
way
curious
to
know
i
spoke
to
him
afterwards
of
the
country
generally
and
of
its
men
he
listened
to
me
still
in
silence
fixing
his
eyes
upon
me
in
such
a
strange
way
that
i
became
ashamed
of
what
i
was
doing
i
was
very
nearly
offending
him
by
offering
him
some
books
and
newspapers
which
i
had
just
received
by
post
he
cast
a
greedy
look
upon
them
he
then
seemed
to
alter
his
mind
and
declined
my
offer
giving
his
want
of
leisure
as
a
pretext
at
last
i
wished
him
and
i
felt
a
weight
fall
from
my
shoulders
as
i
left
the
house
i
regretted
to
have
harassed
a
man
whose
tastes
kept
him
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
but
the
fault
had
been
committed
i
had
remarked
that
he
possessed
very
few
books
it
was
not
true
then
that
he
read
so
much
nevertheless
on
two
occasions
when
i
drove
past
i
saw
a
light
in
his
lodging
what
could
make
him
sit
up
so
late
was
he
writing
and
if
that
were
so
what
was
he
writing
i
was
absent
from
our
town
for
about
three
months
when
i
returned
home
in
the
winter
i
learned
that
petrovitch
was
dead
and
that
he
had
not
even
sent
for
a
doctor
he
was
even
now
already
forgotten
and
his
lodging
was
unoccupied
i
at
once
made
the
acquaintance
of
his
landlady
in
the
hope
of
learning
from
her
what
her
lodger
had
been
writing
for
twenty
kopecks
she
brought
me
a
basket
full
of
papers
left
by
the
defunct
and
confessed
to
me
that
she
had
already
employed
four
sheets
in
lighting
her
fire
she
was
a
morose
and
taciturn
old
woman
i
could
not
get
from
her
anything
that
was
interesting
she
could
tell
me
nothing
about
her
lodger
she
gave
me
to
understand
all
the
same
that
he
scarcely
ever
worked
and
that
he
remained
for
months
together
without
opening
a
book
or
touching
a
pen
on
the
other
hand
he
walked
all
night
up
and
down
his
room
given
up
to
his
reflections
sometimes
indeed
he
spoke
aloud
he
was
very
fond
of
her
little
grandchild
katia
above
all
when
he
knew
her
name
on
her
the
day
of
catherine
he
always
had
a
requiem
said
in
the
church
for
some
one
soul
he
detested
receiving
visits
and
never
went
out
except
to
give
lessons
even
his
landlady
he
looked
upon
with
an
unfriendly
eye
when
once
a
week
she
came
into
his
room
to
put
it
in
order
during
the
three
years
he
had
passed
with
her
he
had
scarcely
ever
spoken
to
her
i
asked
katia
if
she
remembered
him
she
looked
at
me
in
silence
and
turned
weeping
to
the
wall
this
man
then
was
loved
by
some
one
i
took
away
the
papers
and
passed
the
day
in
examining
them
they
were
for
the
most
part
of
no
importance
merely
exercises
at
last
i
came
to
a
rather
thick
packet
the
sheets
of
which
were
covered
with
delicate
handwriting
which
abruptly
ceased
it
had
perhaps
been
forgotten
by
the
writer
it
was
the
narrative
incoherent
and
fragmentary
of
the
ten
years
alexander
petrovitch
had
passed
in
hard
labour
this
narrative
was
interrupted
here
and
there
either
by
anecdotes
or
by
strange
terrible
recollections
thrown
in
convulsively
as
if
torn
from
the
writer
i
read
some
of
these
fragments
again
and
again
and
i
began
to
doubt
whether
they
had
not
been
written
in
moments
of
madness
but
these
memories
of
the
convict
prison
recollections
of
the
as
he
himself
called
them
somewhere
in
his
manuscript
seemed
to
me
not
without
interest
they
revealed
quite
a
new
world
unknown
till
then
and
in
the
strangeness
of
his
facts
together
with
his
singular
remarks
on
this
fallen
people
there
was
enough
to
tempt
me
to
go
on
i
may
perhaps
be
wrong
but
i
will
publish
some
chapters
from
this
narrative
and
the
public
shall
judge
for
itself
chapter
ii
the
our
prison
was
at
the
end
of
the
citadel
behind
the
ramparts
looking
through
the
crevices
between
the
palisade
in
the
hope
of
seeing
something
one
sees
nothing
but
a
little
corner
of
the
sky
and
a
high
earthwork
covered
with
the
long
grass
of
the
steppe
night
and
day
sentries
walk
to
and
fro
upon
it
then
one
perceives
from
the
first
that
whole
years
will
pass
during
which
one
will
see
by
the
same
crevices
between
the
palisades
upon
the
same
earthwork
always
the
same
sentinels
and
the
same
little
corner
of
the
sky
not
just
above
the
prison
but
far
and
far
away
represent
to
yourself
a
two
hundred
feet
long
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
broad
enclosed
by
an
irregular
hexagonal
palisade
formed
of
stakes
thrust
deep
into
the
earth
so
much
for
the
external
surroundings
of
the
prison
on
one
side
of
the
palisade
is
a
great
gate
solid
and
always
shut
watched
perpetually
by
the
sentinels
and
never
opened
except
when
the
convicts
go
out
to
work
beyond
this
there
are
light
and
liberty
the
life
of
free
people
beyond
the
palisade
one
thought
of
the
marvellous
world
fantastic
as
a
fairy
tale
it
was
not
the
same
on
our
side
here
there
was
no
resemblance
to
anything
habits
customs
laws
were
all
precisely
fixed
it
was
the
house
of
living
death
it
is
this
corner
that
i
undertake
to
describe
on
penetrating
into
the
enclosure
one
sees
a
few
buildings
on
each
side
of
a
vast
court
are
stretched
forth
two
wooden
constructions
made
of
trunks
of
trees
and
only
one
storey
high
these
are
barracks
here
the
prisoners
are
confined
divided
into
several
classes
at
the
end
of
the
enclosure
may
be
seen
a
house
which
serves
as
a
kitchen
divided
into
two
compartments
behind
it
is
another
building
which
serves
at
once
as
cellar
loft
and
barn
the
centre
of
the
enclosure
completely
barren
is
a
large
open
space
here
the
prisoners
are
drawn
up
in
ranks
three
times
a
day
they
are
identified
and
must
answer
to
their
names
morning
noon
and
evening
besides
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
day
if
the
soldiers
on
guard
are
suspicious
and
clever
at
counting
all
around
between
the
palisades
and
the
buildings
there
remains
a
sufficiently
large
space
where
some
of
the
prisoners
who
are
misanthropes
or
of
a
sombre
turn
of
mind
like
to
walk
about
when
they
are
not
at
work
there
they
go
turning
over
their
favourite
thoughts
shielded
from
all
observation
when
i
met
them
during
those
walks
of
theirs
i
took
pleasure
in
observing
their
sad
countenances
and
in
guessing
their
thoughts
the
favourite
occupation
of
one
of
the
convicts
during
the
moments
of
liberty
left
to
him
from
his
hard
labour
was
to
count
the
palisades
there
were
fifteen
hundred
of
them
he
had
counted
them
all
and
knew
them
nearly
by
heart
every
one
of
them
represented
to
him
a
day
of
confinement
but
counting
them
daily
in
this
manner
he
knew
exactly
the
number
of
days
that
he
had
still
to
pass
in
the
prison
he
was
sincerely
happy
when
he
had
finished
one
side
of
the
hexagon
yet
he
had
to
wait
for
his
liberation
many
long
years
but
one
learns
patience
in
a
prison
one
day
i
saw
a
prisoner
who
had
undergone
his
punishment
take
leave
of
his
comrades
he
had
had
twenty
years
hard
labour
more
than
one
convict
remembered
seeing
him
arrive
quite
young
careless
thinking
neither
of
his
crime
nor
of
his
punishment
he
was
now
an
old
man
with
gray
hairs
with
a
sad
and
morose
countenance
he
walked
in
silence
through
our
six
barracks
when
he
entered
each
of
them
he
prayed
before
the
holy
image
made
a
deep
bow
to
his
former
companions
and
begged
them
not
to
keep
a
bad
recollection
of
him
i
also
remember
one
evening
a
prisoner
who
had
been
formerly
a
siberian
peasant
so
called
six
years
before
he
had
had
news
of
his
wife
remarrying
which
had
caused
him
great
pain
that
very
evening
she
had
come
to
the
prison
and
had
asked
for
him
in
order
to
make
him
a
present
they
talked
together
for
two
minutes
wept
together
and
then
separated
never
to
meet
again
i
saw
the
expression
of
this
prisoner
countenance
when
he
the
barracks
there
indeed
one
learns
to
support
everything
when
darkness
set
in
we
had
to
the
barrack
where
we
were
shut
up
for
all
the
night
it
was
always
painful
for
me
to
leave
the
for
the
barrack
think
of
a
long
low
stifling
room
scarcely
lighted
by
tallow
candles
and
full
of
heavy
and
disgusting
odours
i
can
not
now
understand
how
i
lived
there
for
ten
entire
years
my
camp
bedstead
was
made
of
three
boards
this
was
the
only
place
in
the
room
that
belonged
to
me
in
one
single
room
we
herded
together
more
than
thirty
men
it
was
above
all
no
wonder
that
we
were
shut
up
early
four
hours
at
least
passed
before
every
one
was
asleep
and
until
then
there
was
a
tumult
and
uproar
of
laughter
oaths
rattling
of
chains
a
poisonous
vapour
of
thick
smoke
a
confusion
of
shaved
heads
stigmatised
foreheads
and
ragged
clothes
disgustingly
filthy
yes
man
is
a
pliable
animal
he
must
be
so
defined
a
being
who
gets
accustomed
to
everything
that
would
be
perhaps
the
best
definition
that
could
be
given
of
him
there
were
altogether
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
us
in
the
same
prison
this
number
was
almost
invariably
the
same
whenever
some
of
them
had
undergone
their
punishment
other
criminals
arrived
and
a
few
of
them
died
among
them
there
were
all
sorts
of
people
i
believe
that
each
region
of
russia
had
furnished
its
representatives
there
were
foreigners
there
and
even
mountaineers
from
the
caucasus
all
these
people
were
divided
into
different
classes
according
to
the
importance
of
the
crime
and
consequently
the
duration
of
the
punishment
for
the
crime
whatever
it
might
be
was
there
represented
the
population
of
the
prison
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
men
condemned
to
hard
labour
of
the
civil
class
strongly
condemned
as
the
prisoners
used
to
say
they
were
criminals
deprived
of
all
civil
rights
men
rejected
by
society
vomited
forth
by
it
and
whose
faces
were
marked
by
the
iron
to
testify
eternally
to
their
disgrace
they
were
incarcerated
for
different
periods
of
time
varying
from
eight
to
ten
years
at
the
expiration
of
their
punishment
they
were
sent
to
the
siberian
districts
in
the
character
of
colonists
as
to
the
criminals
of
the
military
section
they
were
not
deprived
of
their
civil
rights
as
is
generally
the
case
in
russian
disciplinary
companies
but
were
punished
for
a
relatively
short
period
as
soon
as
they
had
undergone
their
punishment
they
had
to
return
to
the
place
whence
they
had
come
and
became
soldiers
in
the
battalions
of
the
siberian
line
many
of
them
came
back
to
us
afterwards
for
serious
crimes
this
time
not
for
a
small
number
of
years
but
for
twenty
at
least
they
then
formed
part
of
the
section
called
for
perpetuity
nevertheless
the
perpetuals
were
not
deprived
of
their
right
there
was
another
section
sufficiently
numerous
composed
of
the
worst
malefactors
nearly
all
veterans
in
crime
and
which
was
called
the
special
section
there
were
sent
convicts
from
all
the
russias
they
looked
upon
one
another
with
reason
as
imprisoned
for
ever
for
the
term
of
their
confinement
had
not
been
indicated
the
law
required
them
to
receive
double
and
treble
tasks
they
remained
in
prison
until
work
of
the
most
painful
character
had
to
be
undertaken
in
siberia
you
are
only
here
for
a
fixed
time
they
said
to
the
other
convicts
we
on
the
contrary
are
here
for
all
our
life
i
have
heard
that
this
section
has
since
been
abolished
at
the
same
time
civil
convicts
are
kept
apart
in
order
that
the
military
convicts
may
be
organised
by
themselves
into
a
homogeneous
disciplinary
company
the
administration
too
has
naturally
been
changed
consequently
what
i
describe
are
the
customs
and
practices
of
another
time
and
of
things
which
have
since
been
abolished
yes
it
was
a
long
time
ago
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
all
a
dream
i
remember
entering
the
convict
prison
one
december
evening
as
night
was
falling
the
convicts
were
returning
from
work
the
was
about
to
be
made
an
under
officer
with
large
moustaches
opened
to
me
the
gate
of
this
strange
house
where
i
was
to
remain
so
many
years
to
endure
so
many
emotions
and
of
which
i
could
not
form
even
an
approximate
idea
if
i
had
not
gone
through
them
thus
for
example
could
i
ever
have
imagined
the
poignant
and
terrible
suffering
of
never
being
alone
even
for
one
minute
during
ten
years
working
under
escort
in
the
barracks
together
with
two
hundred
companions
never
alone
never
however
i
was
obliged
to
get
accustomed
to
it
among
them
there
were
murderers
by
imprudence
and
murderers
by
profession
simple
thieves
masters
in
the
art
of
finding
money
in
the
pockets
of
the
or
of
wiping
off
no
matter
what
from
the
table
it
would
have
been
difficult
however
to
say
why
and
how
certain
prisoners
found
themselves
among
the
convicts
each
of
them
had
his
history
confused
and
heavy
painful
as
the
morning
after
a
debauch
the
convicts
as
a
rule
spoke
very
little
of
their
past
life
which
they
did
not
like
to
think
of
they
endeavoured
even
to
dismiss
it
from
their
memory
amongst
my
companions
of
the
chain
i
have
known
murderers
who
were
so
gay
and
so
free
from
care
that
one
might
have
made
a
bet
that
their
conscience
never
made
them
the
least
reproach
but
there
were
also
men
of
sombre
countenance
who
remained
almost
always
silent
it
was
very
rarely
any
one
told
his
history
this
sort
of
thing
was
not
the
fashion
let
us
say
at
once
that
it
was
not
received
sometimes
however
from
time
to
time
for
the
sake
of
change
a
prisoner
used
to
tell
his
life
to
another
prisoner
who
would
listen
coldly
to
the
narrative
no
one
to
tell
the
truth
could
have
said
anything
to
astonish
his
neighbour
we
are
not
ignoramuses
they
would
sometimes
say
with
singular
pride
i
remember
one
day
a
ruffian
who
had
got
drunk
it
was
sometimes
possible
for
the
convicts
to
get
drink
relating
how
he
had
killed
and
cut
up
a
child
of
five
he
had
first
tempted
the
child
with
a
plaything
and
then
taking
it
to
a
loft
had
cut
it
up
to
pieces
the
entire
barrack
which
generally
speaking
laughed
at
his
jokes
uttered
one
unanimous
cry
the
ruffian
was
obliged
to
be
silent
but
if
the
convicts
had
interrupted
him
it
was
not
by
any
means
because
his
recital
had
caused
their
indignation
but
because
it
was
not
allowed
to
speak
of
such
things
i
must
here
observe
that
the
convicts
possessed
a
certain
degree
of
instruction
half
of
them
if
not
more
knew
how
to
read
and
write
where
in
russia
in
no
matter
what
population
could
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
be
found
able
to
read
and
write
later
on
i
have
heard
people
say
and
conclude
on
the
strength
of
these
abuses
that
education
demoralises
the
people
this
is
a
mistake
education
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
moral
deterioration
it
must
be
admitted
nevertheless
that
it
develops
a
resolute
spirit
among
the
people
but
this
is
far
from
being
a
defect
each
section
had
a
different
costume
the
uniform
of
one
was
a
cloth
vest
half
brown
and
half
gray
and
trousers
with
one
leg
brown
the
other
gray
one
day
while
we
were
at
work
a
little
girl
who
sold
scones
of
white
bread
came
towards
the
convicts
she
looked
at
them
for
a
time
and
then
burst
into
a
laugh
oh
how
ugly
they
are
she
cried
they
have
not
even
enough
gray
cloth
or
brown
cloth
to
make
their
clothes
every
convict
wore
a
vest
made
of
gray
cloth
except
the
sleeves
which
were
brown
their
heads
too
were
shaved
in
different
styles
the
crown
was
bared
sometimes
longitudinally
sometimes
latitudinally
from
the
nape
of
the
neck
to
the
forehead
or
from
one
ear
to
another
this
strange
family
had
a
general
likeness
so
pronounced
that
it
could
be
recognised
at
a
glance
even
the
most
striking
personalities
those
who
dominated
involuntarily
the
other
convicts
could
not
help
taking
the
general
tone
of
the
house
of
the
convicts
with
the
exception
of
a
few
who
enjoyed
childish
gaiety
and
who
by
that
alone
drew
upon
themselves
general
contempt
all
the
convicts
were
morose
envious
frightfully
vain
presumptuous
susceptible
and
excessively
ceremonious
to
be
astonished
at
nothing
was
in
their
eyes
the
first
and
indispensable
quality
accordingly
their
first
aim
was
to
bear
themselves
with
dignity
but
often
the
most
composed
demeanour
gave
way
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
with
the
basest
humility
some
however
possessed
genuine
strength
these
were
naturally
all
sincere
but
strangely
enough
they
were
for
the
most
part
excessively
and
morbidly
vain
vanity
was
always
their
salient
quality
the
majority
of
the
prisoners
were
depraved
and
perverted
so
that
calumnies
and
scandal
rained
amongst
them
like
hail
our
life
was
a
constant
hell
a
perpetual
damnation
but
no
one
would
have
dared
to
raise
a
voice
against
the
internal
regulations
of
the
prison
or
against
established
usages
accordingly
willingly
or
unwillingly
they
had
to
be
submitted
to
certain
indomitable
characters
yielded
with
difficulty
but
they
yielded
all
the
same
prisoners
who
when
at
liberty
had
gone
beyond
all
measure
who
urged
by
their
vanity
had
committed
frightful
crimes
unconsciously
as
if
in
a
delirium
and
had
been
the
terror
of
entire
towns
were
put
down
in
a
very
short
time
by
the
system
of
our
prison
the
new
man
when
he
began
to
reconnoitre
soon
found
that
he
could
astonish
no
one
and
insensibly
he
submitted
took
the
general
tone
and
assumed
a
sort
of
personal
dignity
which
almost
every
convict
maintained
just
as
if
the
denomination
of
convict
had
been
a
title
of
honour
not
the
least
sign
of
shame
or
of
repentance
but
a
kind
of
external
submission
which
seemed
to
have
been
reasoned
out
as
the
line
of
conduct
to
be
pursued
we
are
lost
men
they
said
to
themselves
we
were
unable
to
live
in
liberty
we
must
now
go
to
green
street
you
would
not
obey
your
father
and
mother
you
will
now
obey
thongs
of
leather
the
man
who
would
not
sow
must
now
break
stones
these
things
were
said
and
repeated
in
the
way
of
morality
as
sentences
and
proverbs
but
without
any
one
taking
them
seriously
they
were
but
words
in
the
air
there
was
not
one
man
among
them
who
admitted
his
iniquity
let
a
stranger
not
a
convict
endeavour
to
reproach
him
with
his
crime
and
the
insults
directed
against
him
would
be
endless
and
how
refined
are
convicts
in
the
matter
of
insults
they
insult
delicately
like
artists
insult
with
the
most
delicate
science
they
endeavour
not
so
much
to
offend
by
the
expression
as
by
the
meaning
the
spirit
of
an
envenomed
phrase
their
incessant
quarrels
developed
greatly
this
special
art
as
they
only
worked
under
the
threat
of
an
immense
stick
they
were
idle
and
depraved
those
who
were
not
already
corrupt
when
they
arrived
at
the
convict
establishment
became
perverted
very
soon
brought
together
in
spite
of
themselves
they
were
perfect
strangers
to
one
another
the
devil
has
worn
out
three
pairs
of
sandals
before
he
got
us
together
they
would
say
intrigues
calumnies
scandal
of
all
kinds
envy
and
hatred
reigned
above
everything
else
in
this
life
of
sloth
no
ordinary
spiteful
tongue
could
make
head
against
these
murderers
with
insults
constantly
in
their
mouths
as
i
said
before
there
were
found
among
them
men
of
open
character
resolute
intrepid
accustomed
to
these
were
held
involuntarily
in
esteem
although
they
were
very
jealous
of
their
reputation
they
endeavoured
to
annoy
no
one
and
never
insulted
one
another
without
a
motive
their
conduct
was
on
all
points
full
of
dignity
they
were
rational
and
almost
always
obedient
not
by
principle
or
from
any
respect
for
duty
but
as
if
in
virtue
of
a
mutual
convention
between
themselves
and
the
administration
a
convention
of
which
the
advantages
were
plain
enough
the
officials
moreover
behaved
prudently
towards
them
i
remember
that
one
prisoner
of
the
resolute
and
intrepid
class
known
to
possess
the
instincts
of
a
wild
beast
was
summoned
one
day
to
be
whipped
it
was
during
the
summer
no
work
was
being
done
the
adjutant
the
direct
and
immediate
chief
of
the
convict
prison
was
in
the
by
the
side
of
the
principal
entrance
ready
to
assist
at
the
punishment
this
major
was
a
fatal
being
for
the
prisoners
whom
he
had
brought
to
such
a
state
that
they
trembled
before
him
severe
to
the
point
of
insanity
he
threw
himself
upon
them
to
use
their
expression
but
it
was
above
all
that
his
look
as
penetrating
as
that
of
a
lynx
was
feared
it
was
impossible
to
conceal
anything
from
him
he
saw
so
to
say
without
looking
on
entering
the
prison
he
knew
at
once
what
was
being
done
accordingly
the
convicts
one
and
all
called
him
the
man
with
the
eight
eyes
his
system
was
bad
for
it
had
the
effect
of
irritating
men
who
were
already
irascible
but
for
the
commandant
a
and
reasonable
man
who
moderated
the
savage
onslaughts
of
the
major
the
latter
would
have
caused
sad
misfortunes
by
his
bad
administration
i
do
not
understand
how
he
managed
to
retire
from
the
service
safe
and
sound
it
is
true
that
he
left
after
being
called
before
a
the
prisoner
turned
pale
when
he
was
called
generally
speaking
he
lay
down
courageously
and
without
uttering
a
word
to
receive
the
terrible
rods
after
which
he
got
up
and
shook
himself
he
bore
the
misfortune
calmly
philosophically
it
is
true
though
he
was
never
punished
carelessly
nor
without
all
sorts
of
precautions
but
this
time
he
considered
himself
innocent
he
turned
pale
and
as
he
walked
quietly
towards
the
escort
of
soldiers
he
managed
to
conceal
in
his
sleeve
a
shoemaker
awl
the
prisoners
were
severely
forbidden
to
carry
sharp
instruments
about
them
examinations
were
frequently
minutely
and
unexpectedly
made
and
all
infractions
of
the
rule
were
severely
punished
but
as
it
is
difficult
to
take
away
from
the
criminal
what
he
is
determined
to
conceal
and
as
moreover
sharp
instruments
are
necessarily
used
in
the
prison
they
were
never
destroyed
if
the
official
succeeded
in
taking
them
away
from
the
convicts
the
latter
procured
new
ones
very
soon
on
the
occasion
in
question
all
the
convicts
had
now
thrown
themselves
against
the
palisade
with
palpitating
hearts
to
look
through
the
crevices
it
was
known
that
this
time
petroff
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
flogged
that
the
end
of
the
major
had
come
but
at
the
critical
moment
the
latter
got
into
his
carriage
and
went
away
leaving
the
direction
of
the
punishment
to
a
subaltern
god
has
saved
him
said
the
convicts
as
for
petroff
he
underwent
his
punishment
quietly
once
the
major
had
gone
his
anger
fell
the
prisoner
is
submissive
and
obedient
to
a
certain
point
but
there
is
a
limit
which
must
not
be
crossed
nothing
is
more
curious
than
these
strange
outbursts
of
disobedience
and
rage
often
a
man
who
has
supported
for
many
years
the
most
cruel
punishment
will
revolt
for
a
trifle
for
nothing
at
all
he
might
pass
for
a
madman
that
in
fact
is
what
is
said
of
him
i
have
already
said
that
during
many
years
i
never
remarked
the
least
sign
of
repentance
not
even
the
slightest
uneasiness
with
regard
to
the
crime
committed
and
that
most
of
the
convicts
considered
neither
honour
nor
conscience
holding
that
they
had
a
right
to
act
as
they
thought
fit
certainly
vanity
evil
examples
deceitfulness
and
false
shame
were
responsible
for
much
on
the
other
hand
who
can
claim
to
have
sounded
the
depths
of
these
hearts
given
over
to
perdition
and
to
have
found
them
closed
to
all
light
it
would
seem
all
the
same
that
during
so
many
years
i
ought
to
have
been
able
to
notice
some
indication
even
the
most
fugitive
of
some
regret
some
moral
suffering
i
positively
saw
nothing
of
the
kind
with
opinions
one
can
not
judge
of
crime
its
philosophy
is
a
little
more
complicated
than
people
think
it
is
acknowledged
that
neither
convict
prisons
nor
the
hulks
nor
any
system
of
hard
labour
ever
cured
a
criminal
these
forms
of
chastisement
only
punish
him
and
reassure
society
against
the
offences
he
might
commit
confinement
regulation
and
excessive
work
have
no
effect
but
to
develop
with
these
men
profound
hatred
a
thirst
for
forbidden
enjoyment
and
frightful
recalcitrations
on
the
other
hand
i
am
convinced
that
the
celebrated
cellular
system
gives
results
which
are
specious
and
deceitful
it
deprives
a
criminal
of
his
force
of
his
energy
enervates
his
soul
by
weakening
and
frightening
it
and
at
last
exhibits
a
dried
up
mummy
as
a
model
of
repentance
and
amendment
the
criminal
who
has
revolted
against
society
hates
it
and
considers
himself
in
the
right
society
was
wrong
not
he
has
he
not
moreover
undergone
his
punishment
accordingly
he
is
absolved
acquitted
in
his
own
eyes
in
spite
of
different
opinions
every
one
will
acknowledge
that
there
are
crimes
which
everywhere
always
under
no
matter
what
legislation
are
beyond
discussion
crimes
and
should
be
regarded
as
such
as
long
as
man
is
man
it
is
only
at
the
convict
prison
that
i
have
heard
related
with
a
childish
unrestrained
laugh
the
strangest
most
atrocious
offences
i
shall
never
forget
a
certain
parricide
formerly
a
nobleman
and
a
public
functionary
he
had
given
great
grief
to
his
father
a
true
prodigal
son
the
old
man
endeavoured
in
vain
to
restrain
him
by
remonstrance
on
the
fatal
slope
down
which
he
was
sliding
as
he
was
loaded
with
debts
and
his
father
was
suspected
of
having
besides
an
estate
a
sum
of
ready
money
he
killed
him
in
order
to
enter
more
quickly
into
his
inheritance
this
crime
was
not
discovered
until
a
month
afterwards
during
all
this
time
the
murderer
who
meanwhile
had
informed
the
police
of
his
father
disappearance
continued
his
debauches
at
last
during
his
absence
the
police
discovered
the
old
man
corpse
in
a
drain
the
gray
head
was
severed
from
the
trunk
but
replaced
in
its
original
position
the
body
was
entirely
dressed
beneath
as
if
by
derision
the
assassin
had
placed
a
cushion
the
young
man
confessed
nothing
he
was
degraded
deprived
of
his
nobiliary
privileges
and
condemned
to
twenty
years
hard
labour
as
long
as
i
knew
him
i
always
found
him
to
be
careless
of
his
position
he
was
the
most
inconsiderate
man
that
i
ever
met
although
he
was
far
from
being
a
fool
i
never
observed
in
him
any
great
tendency
to
cruelty
the
other
convicts
despised
him
not
on
account
of
his
crime
of
which
there
was
never
any
question
but
because
he
was
without
dignity
he
sometimes
spoke
of
his
father
one
day
for
instance
boasting
of
the
hereditary
good
health
of
his
family
he
said
my
father
for
example
until
his
death
was
never
animal
insensibility
carried
to
such
a
point
is
most
remarkable
it
is
indeed
phenomenal
there
must
have
been
in
this
case
an
organic
defect
in
the
man
some
physical
and
moral
monstrosity
unknown
hitherto
to
science
and
not
simply
crime
i
naturally
did
not
believe
in
so
atrocious
a
crime
but
people
of
the
same
town
as
himself
who
knew
all
the
details
of
his
history
related
it
to
me
the
facts
were
so
clear
that
it
would
have
been
madness
not
to
accept
them
the
prisoners
once
heard
him
cry
out
during
his
sleep
hold
him
hold
him
cut
his
head
off
his
head
his
head
nearly
all
the
convicts
dreamed
aloud
or
were
delirious
in
their
sleep
insults
words
of
slang
knives
hatchets
seemed
constantly
present
in
their
dreams
we
are
crushed
they
would
say
we
are
without
entrails
that
is
why
we
shriek
in
the
night
hard
labour
in
our
fortress
was
not
an
occupation
but
an
obligation
the
prisoners
accomplished
their
task
they
worked
the
number
of
hours
fixed
by
the
law
and
then
returned
to
the
prison
they
hated
their
liberty
if
the
convict
did
not
do
some
work
on
his
own
account
voluntarily
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
support
his
confinement
how
could
these
persons
all
strongly
constituted
who
had
lived
sumptuously
and
desired
so
to
live
again
who
had
been
brought
together
against
their
will
after
society
had
cast
them
up
how
could
they
live
in
a
normal
and
natural
manner
man
can
not
exist
without
work
without
legal
natural
property
depart
from
these
conditions
and
he
becomes
perverted
and
changed
into
a
wild
beast
accordingly
every
convict
through
natural
requirements
and
by
the
instinct
of
had
a
trade
an
occupation
of
some
kind
the
long
days
of
summer
were
taken
up
almost
entirely
by
our
hard
labour
the
night
was
so
short
that
we
had
only
just
time
to
sleep
it
was
not
the
same
in
winter
according
to
the
regulations
the
prisoners
had
to
be
shut
up
in
the
barracks
at
nightfall
what
was
to
be
done
during
these
long
sad
evenings
but
work
consequently
each
barrack
though
locked
and
bolted
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
large
workshop
the
work
was
not
it
is
true
strictly
forbidden
but
it
was
forbidden
to
have
tools
without
which
work
is
evidently
impossible
but
we
laboured
in
secret
and
the
administration
seemed
to
shut
its
eyes
many
prisoners
arrived
without
knowing
how
to
make
use
of
their
ten
fingers
but
they
learnt
a
trade
from
some
of
their
companions
and
became
excellent
workmen
we
had
among
us
cobblers
bootmakers
tailors
masons
locksmiths
and
gilders
a
jew
named
esau
boumstein
was
at
the
same
time
a
jeweller
and
a
usurer
every
one
worked
and
thus
gained
a
few
pence
for
many
orders
came
from
the
town
money
is
a
tangible
resonant
liberty
inestimable
for
a
man
entirely
deprived
of
true
liberty
if
he
feels
some
money
in
his
pocket
he
consoles
himself
a
little
even
though
he
can
not
spend
it
but
one
can
always
and
everywhere
spend
money
the
more
so
as
forbidden
fruit
is
doubly
sweet
one
can
often
buy
spirits
in
the
convict
prison
although
pipes
are
severely
forbidden
every
one
smokes
money
and
tobacco
save
the
convicts
from
the
scurvy
as
work
saves
them
from
crime
for
without
work
they
would
mutually
have
destroyed
one
another
like
spiders
shut
up
in
a
close
bottle
work
and
money
were
all
the
same
forbidden
often
during
the
night
severe
examinations
were
made
during
which
everything
that
was
not
legally
authorised
was
confiscated
however
successfully
the
little
hoards
had
been
concealed
they
were
sometimes
discovered
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
were
not
kept
very
long
they
were
exchanged
as
soon
as
possible
for
drink
which
explains
how
it
happened
that
spirits
penetrated
into
the
convict
prison
the
delinquent
was
not
only
deprived
of
his
hoard
but
was
also
cruelly
flogged
a
short
time
after
each
examination
the
convicts
procured
again
the
objects
which
had
been
confiscated
and
everything
went
on
as
before
the
administration
knew
it
and
although
the
condition
of
the
convicts
was
a
good
deal
like
that
of
the
inhabitants
of
vesuvius
they
never
murmured
at
the
punishment
inflicted
for
these
peccadilloes
those
who
had
no
manual
skill
did
business
somehow
or
other
the
modes
of
buying
and
selling
were
original
enough
things
changed
hands
which
no
one
expected
a
convict
would
ever
have
thought
of
selling
or
buying
or
even
of
regarding
as
of
any
value
whatever
the
least
rag
had
its
value
and
might
be
turned
to
account
in
consequence
however
of
the
poverty
of
the
convicts
money
acquired
in
their
eyes
a
superior
value
to
that
really
belonging
to
it
long
and
painful
tasks
sometimes
of
a
very
complicated
kind
brought
back
a
few
kopecks
several
of
the
prisoners
lent
by
the
week
and
did
good
business
that
way
the
prisoner
who
was
ruined
and
insolvent
carried
to
the
usurer
the
few
things
belonging
to
him
and
pledged
them
for
some
halfpence
which
were
lent
to
him
at
a
fabulous
rate
of
interest
if
he
did
not
redeem
them
at
the
fixed
time
the
usurer
sold
them
pitilessly
by
auction
and
without
the
least
delay
usury
flourished
so
well
in
our
convict
prison
that
money
was
lent
even
on
things
belonging
to
the
government
linen
boots
things
that
were
wanted
at
every
moment
when
the
lender
accepted
such
pledges
the
affair
took
an
unexpected
turn
the
proprietor
went
immediately
after
he
had
received
his
money
and
told
the
under
officer
chief
superintendent
of
the
convict
prison
that
objects
belonging
to
the
state
were
being
concealed
on
which
everything
was
taken
away
from
the
usurer
without
even
the
formality
of
a
report
to
the
superior
administration
but
never
was
there
any
quarrel
and
that
is
very
curious
indeed
between
the
usurer
and
the
owner
the
first
gave
up
in
silence
with
a
morose
air
the
things
demanded
from
him
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
the
request
sometimes
perhaps
he
confessed
to
himself
that
in
the
place
of
the
borrower
he
would
not
have
acted
differently
accordingly
if
he
was
insulted
after
this
restitution
it
was
less
from
hatred
than
simply
as
a
matter
of
conscience
the
convicts
robbed
one
another
without
shame
each
prisoner
had
his
little
box
fitted
with
a
padlock
in
which
he
kept
the
things
entrusted
to
him
by
the
administration
although
these
boxes
were
authorised
that
did
not
prevent
them
from
being
broken
into
the
reader
can
easily
imagine
what
clever
thieves
were
found
among
us
a
prisoner
who
was
sincerely
devoted
to
me
i
say
it
without
boasting
stole
my
bible
from
me
the
only
book
allowed
in
the
convict
prison
he
told
me
of
it
the
same
day
not
from
repentance
but
because
he
pitied
me
when
he
saw
me
looking
for
it
everywhere
we
had
among
our
companions
of
the
chain
several
convicts
called
innkeepers
who
sold
spirits
and
became
comparatively
rich
by
doing
so
i
shall
speak
of
this
further
on
for
the
liquor
traffic
deserves
special
study
a
great
number
of
prisoners
had
been
deported
for
smuggling
which
explains
how
it
was
that
drink
was
brought
secretly
into
the
convict
prison
under
so
severe
a
surveillance
as
ours
was
in
passing
it
may
be
remarked
that
smuggling
is
an
offence
apart
would
it
be
believed
that
money
the
solid
profit
from
the
affair
possesses
often
only
secondary
importance
for
the
smuggler
it
is
all
the
same
an
authentic
fact
he
works
by
vocation
in
his
style
he
is
a
poet
he
risks
all
he
possesses
exposes
himself
to
terrible
dangers
intrigues
invents
gets
out
of
a
scrape
and
brings
everything
to
a
happy
end
by
a
sort
of
inspiration
this
passion
is
as
violent
as
that
of
play
i
knew
a
prisoner
of
colossal
stature
who
was
the
mildest
the
most
peaceable
and
most
manageable
man
it
was
possible
to
see
we
often
asked
one
another
how
he
had
been
deported
he
had
such
a
calm
sociable
character
that
during
the
whole
time
that
he
passed
at
the
convict
prison
he
never
quarrelled
with
any
one
born
in
western
russia
where
he
lived
on
the
frontier
he
had
been
sent
to
hard
labour
for
smuggling
naturally
then
he
could
not
resist
his
desire
to
smuggle
spirits
into
the
prison
how
many
times
was
he
not
punished
for
it
and
heaven
knows
how
much
he
feared
the
rods
this
dangerous
trade
brought
him
in
but
slender
profits
it
was
the
speculator
who
got
rich
at
his
expense
each
time
he
was
punished
he
wept
like
an
old
woman
and
swore
by
all
that
was
holy
that
he
would
never
be
caught
at
such
things
again
he
kept
his
vow
for
an
entire
month
but
he
ended
by
yielding
once
more
to
his
passion
thanks
to
these
amateurs
of
smuggling
spirits
were
always
to
be
had
in
the
convict
prison
another
source
of
income
which
without
enriching
the
prisoners
was
constantly
and
beneficently
turned
to
account
was
the
upper
classes
of
our
russian
society
do
not
know
to
what
an
extent
merchants
shopkeepers
and
our
people
generally
commiserate
the
unfortunate
alms
were
always
forthcoming
and
consisted
generally
of
little
white
loaves
sometimes
of
money
but
very
rarely
without
alms
the
existence
of
the
convicts
and
above
all
that
of
the
accused
who
are
badly
fed
would
be
too
painful
these
alms
are
shared
equally
between
all
the
prisoners
if
the
gifts
are
not
sufficient
the
little
loaves
are
divided
into
halves
and
sometimes
into
six
pieces
so
that
each
convict
may
have
his
share
i
remember
the
first
alms
a
small
piece
of
money
that
i
received
a
short
time
after
my
arrival
one
morning
as
i
was
coming
back
from
work
with
a
soldier
escort
i
met
a
mother
and
her
daughter
a
child
of
ten
as
beautiful
as
an
angel
i
had
already
seen
them
once
before
the
mother
was
the
widow
of
a
poor
soldier
who
while
still
young
had
been
sentenced
by
a
and
had
died
in
the
infirmary
of
the
convict
prison
while
i
was
there
they
wept
hot
tears
when
they
came
to
bid
him
on
seeing
me
the
little
girl
blushed
and
murmured
a
few
words
into
her
mother
ear
who
stopped
and
took
from
a
basket
a
kopeck
which
she
gave
to
the
little
girl
the
little
girl
ran
after
me
here
poor
man
she
said
take
this
in
the
name
of
christ
i
took
the
money
which
she
slipped
into
my
hand
the
little
girl
returned
joyfully
to
her
mother
i
preserved
that
kopeck
a
considerable
time

chapter
iii
first
impressions
during
the
first
weeks
and
naturally
the
early
part
of
my
imprisonment
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
imagination
the
following
years
on
the
other
hand
are
all
mixed
up
together
and
leave
but
a
confused
recollection
certain
epochs
of
this
life
are
even
effaced
from
my
memory
i
have
kept
one
general
impression
of
it
always
the
same
painful
monotonous
stifling
what
i
saw
in
experience
during
the
first
days
of
my
imprisonment
seems
to
me
as
if
it
had
all
taken
place
yesterday
such
was
sure
to
be
the
case
i
remember
perfectly
that
in
the
first
place
this
life
astonished
me
by
the
very
fact
that
it
offered
nothing
particular
nothing
extraordinary
or
to
express
myself
better
nothing
unexpected
it
was
not
until
later
on
when
i
had
lived
some
time
in
the
convict
prison
that
i
understood
all
that
was
exceptional
and
unforeseen
in
such
a
life
i
was
astonished
at
the
discovery
i
will
avow
that
this
astonishment
remained
with
me
throughout
my
term
of
punishment
i
could
not
decidedly
reconcile
myself
to
this
existence
first
of
all
i
experienced
an
invincible
repugnance
on
arriving
but
oddly
enough
the
life
seemed
to
me
less
painful
than
i
had
imagined
on
the
journey
indeed
prisoners
though
embarrassed
by
their
irons
went
to
and
fro
in
the
prison
freely
enough
they
insulted
one
another
sang
worked
smoked
pipes
and
drank
spirits
there
were
not
many
drinkers
all
the
same
there
were
also
regular
card
parties
during
the
night
the
labour
did
not
seem
to
me
very
trying
i
fancied
that
it
could
not
be
the
real
hard
labour
i
did
not
understand
till
long
afterwards
why
this
labour
was
really
hard
and
excessive
it
was
less
by
reason
of
its
difficulty
than
because
it
was
forced
imposed
obligatory
and
it
was
only
done
through
fear
of
the
stick
the
peasant
works
certainly
harder
than
the
convict
for
during
the
summer
he
works
night
and
day
but
it
is
in
his
own
interest
that
he
fatigues
himself
his
aim
is
reasonable
so
that
he
suffers
less
than
the
convict
who
performs
hard
labour
from
which
he
derives
no
profit
it
once
came
into
my
head
that
if
it
were
desired
to
reduce
a
man
to
nothing
to
punish
him
atrociously
to
crush
him
in
such
a
manner
that
the
most
hardened
murderer
would
tremble
before
such
a
punishment
and
take
fright
beforehand
it
would
be
necessary
to
give
to
his
work
a
character
of
complete
uselessness
even
to
absurdity
hard
labour
as
it
is
now
carried
on
presents
no
interest
to
the
convict
but
it
has
its
utility
the
convict
makes
bricks
digs
the
earth
builds
and
all
his
occupations
have
a
meaning
and
an
end
sometimes
even
the
prisoner
takes
an
interest
in
what
he
is
doing
he
then
wishes
to
work
more
skilfully
more
advantageously
but
let
him
be
constrained
to
pour
water
from
one
vessel
into
another
or
to
transport
a
quantity
of
earth
from
one
place
to
another
in
order
to
perform
the
contrary
operation
immediately
afterwards
then
i
am
persuaded
that
at
the
end
of
a
few
days
the
prisoner
would
strangle
himself
or
commit
a
thousand
crimes
punishable
with
death
rather
than
live
in
such
an
abject
condition
and
endure
such
torments
it
is
evident
that
such
punishment
would
be
rather
a
torture
an
atrocious
vengeance
than
a
correction
it
would
be
absurd
for
it
would
have
no
natural
end
i
did
not
however
arrive
until
the
winter
in
the
month
of
december
and
the
labour
was
then
unimportant
in
our
fortress
i
had
no
idea
of
the
summer
labour
five
times
as
fatiguing
the
prisoners
during
the
winter
season
broke
up
on
the
irtitch
some
old
boats
belonging
to
the
government
found
occupation
in
the
workshops
took
away
the
snow
blown
by
hurricanes
against
the
buildings
or
burned
and
pounded
alabaster
as
the
day
was
very
short
the
work
ceased
at
an
early
hour
and
every
one
returned
to
the
convict
prison
where
there
was
scarcely
anything
to
do
except
the
supplementary
work
which
the
convicts
did
for
themselves
scarcely
a
third
of
the
convicts
worked
seriously
the
others
idled
their
time
and
wandered
about
without
aim
in
the
barracks
scheming
and
insulting
one
another
those
who
had
a
little
money
got
drunk
on
spirits
or
lost
what
they
had
saved
at
gambling
and
all
this
from
idleness
weariness
and
want
of
something
to
do
i
learned
moreover
to
know
one
suffering
which
is
perhaps
the
sharpest
the
most
painful
that
can
be
experienced
in
a
house
of
detention
apart
from
laws
and
liberty
i
mean
forced
cohabitation
cohabitation
is
more
or
less
forced
everywhere
and
always
but
nowhere
is
it
so
horrible
as
in
a
prison
there
are
men
there
with
whom
no
one
would
consent
to
live
i
am
certain
that
every
convict
unconsciously
perhaps
has
suffered
from
this
the
food
of
the
prisoners
seemed
to
me
passable
some
declared
even
that
it
was
incomparably
better
than
in
any
russian
prison
i
can
not
certify
to
this
for
i
was
never
in
prison
anywhere
else
many
of
us
besides
were
allowed
to
procure
whatever
nourishment
we
wanted
as
fresh
meat
cost
only
three
kopecks
a
pound
those
who
always
had
money
allowed
themselves
the
luxury
of
eating
it
the
majority
of
the
prisoners
were
contented
with
the
regular
ration
when
they
praised
the
diet
of
the
convict
prison
they
were
thinking
only
of
the
bread
which
was
distributed
at
the
rate
of
so
much
per
room
and
not
individually
or
by
weight
this
last
condition
would
have
frightened
the
convicts
for
a
third
of
them
at
least
would
have
constantly
suffered
from
hunger
while
with
the
system
in
vogue
every
one
was
satisfied
our
bread
was
particularly
nice
and
was
even
renowned
in
the
town
its
good
quality
was
attributed
to
the
excellent
construction
of
the
prison
ovens
as
for
our
it
was
cooked
and
thickened
with
flour
it
had
not
an
appetising
appearance
on
working
days
it
was
clear
and
thin
but
what
particularly
disgusted
me
was
the
way
it
was
served
the
prisoners
however
paid
no
attention
to
that
during
the
three
days
that
followed
my
arrival
i
did
not
go
to
work
some
respite
was
always
given
to
prisoners
just
arrived
in
order
to
allow
them
to
recover
from
their
fatigue
the
second
day
i
had
to
go
out
of
the
convict
prison
in
order
to
be
ironed
my
chain
was
not
of
the
regulation
pattern
it
was
composed
of
rings
which
gave
forth
a
clear
sound
so
i
heard
other
convicts
say
i
had
to
wear
them
externally
over
my
clothes
whereas
my
companions
had
chains
formed
not
of
rings
but
of
four
links
as
thick
as
the
finger
and
fastened
together
by
three
links
which
were
worn
beneath
the
trousers
to
the
central
ring
was
fastened
a
strip
of
leather
tied
in
its
turn
to
a
girdle
fastened
over
the
shirt
i
can
see
again
the
first
morning
that
i
passed
in
the
convict
prison
the
drum
sounded
in
the
orderly
room
near
the
principal
entrance
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
under
officer
opened
the
barracks
the
convicts
woke
up
one
after
another
and
rose
trembling
with
cold
from
their
plank
bedsteads
by
the
dull
light
of
a
tallow
candle
nearly
all
of
them
were
morose
they
yawned
and
stretched
themselves
their
foreheads
marked
by
the
iron
were
contracted
some
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
others
began
to
talk
nonsense
the
cold
air
from
outside
rushed
in
as
soon
as
the
door
was
opened
then
the
prisoners
hurried
round
the
pails
full
of
water
one
after
another
and
took
water
in
their
mouths
and
letting
it
out
into
their
hands
washed
their
faces
those
pails
had
been
brought
in
the
night
before
by
a
prisoner
specially
appointed
according
to
the
rules
to
clean
the
barracks
the
convicts
chose
him
themselves
he
did
not
work
with
the
others
for
it
was
his
business
to
examine
the
camp
bedsteads
and
the
floors
to
fetch
and
carry
water
this
water
served
in
the
morning
for
the
prisoners
ablutions
and
the
rest
during
the
day
for
ordinary
drinking
that
very
morning
there
were
disputes
on
the
subject
of
one
of
the
pitchers
what
are
you
doing
there
with
your
marked
forehead
grumbled
one
of
the
prisoners
tall
dry
and
sallow
he
attracted
attention
by
the
strange
protuberances
with
which
his
skull
was
covered
he
pushed
against
another
convict
round
and
small
with
a
lively
rubicund
countenance
just
wait
what
are
you
crying
out
about
you
know
that
a
fine
must
be
paid
when
the
others
are
kept
waiting
off
with
you
what
a
monument
my
brethren
a
little
calf
he
went
on
muttering
see
the
white
bread
of
the
prison
has
fattened
him
for
what
do
you
take
yourself
a
fine
bird
indeed
you
are
about
right
what
bird
do
you
mean
you
do
require
to
be
told
how
so
find
out
they
devoured
one
another
with
their
eyes
the
little
man
waiting
for
a
reply
with
clenched
fists
was
apparently
ready
to
fight
i
thought
that
an
encounter
would
take
place
it
was
all
quite
new
to
me
accordingly
i
watched
the
scene
with
curiosity
later
on
i
learnt
that
such
quarrels
were
very
innocent
that
they
served
for
entertainment
like
an
amusing
comedy
it
scarcely
ever
ended
in
blows
this
characteristic
plainly
informed
me
of
the
manners
of
the
prisoners
the
tall
prisoner
remained
calm
and
majestic
he
felt
that
some
answer
was
expected
from
him
if
he
was
not
to
be
dishonoured
covered
with
ridicule
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
show
that
he
was
a
wonderful
bird
a
personage
accordingly
he
cast
a
side
look
on
his
adversary
endeavouring
with
inexpressible
contempt
to
irritate
him
by
looking
at
him
over
his
shoulders
up
and
down
as
he
would
have
done
with
an
insect
at
last
the
little
fat
man
was
so
irritated
that
he
would
have
thrown
himself
upon
his
adversary
had
not
his
companions
surrounded
the
combatants
to
prevent
a
serious
quarrel
from
taking
place
fight
with
your
fists
not
with
your
tongues
cried
a
spectator
from
a
corner
of
the
room
no
hold
them
answered
another
they
are
going
to
fight
we
are
fine
fellows
one
against
seven
is
our
style
fine
fighting
men
one
was
here
for
having
sneaked
a
pound
of
bread
the
other
is
a
he
was
whipped
by
the
executioner
for
stealing
a
pot
of
curdled
milk
from
an
old
woman
enough
keep
quiet
cried
a
retired
soldier
whose
business
it
was
to
keep
order
in
the
barrack
and
who
slept
in
a
corner
of
the
room
on
a
bedstead
of
his
own
water

for
our
little
brother
who
has
just
woke
up
your
brother
am
i
your
brother
did
we
ever
drink
a
roublesworth
of
spirits
together
muttered
the
old
soldier
as
he
passed
his
arms
through
the
sleeves
of
his
the
roll
was
about
to
be
called
for
it
was
already
late
the
prisoners
were
hurrying
towards
the
kitchen
they
had
to
put
on
their
pelisses
and
were
to
receive
in
their
caps
the
bread
which
one
of
the
cooks
one
of
the
bakers
that
is
to
say
was
distributing
among
them
these
cooks
like
those
who
did
the
household
work
were
chosen
by
the
prisoners
themselves
there
were
two
for
the
kitchen
making
four
in
all
for
the
convict
prison
they
had
at
their
disposal
the
only
authorised
in
the
prison
which
was
used
for
cutting
up
the
bread
and
meat
the
prisoners
arranged
themselves
in
groups
around
the
tables
as
best
they
could
in
caps
and
pelisses
with
leather
girdles
round
their
waists
all
ready
to
begin
work
some
of
the
convicts
had
kvas
before
them
in
which
they
steeped
pieces
of
bread
the
noise
was
insupportable
many
of
the
convicts
however
were
talking
together
in
corners
with
a
steady
tranquil
air
and
good
appetite
father
antonitch
said
a
young
prisoner
sitting
down
by
the
side
of
an
old
man
who
had
lost
his
teeth
if
you
are
not
joking
well
said
the
latter
without
raising
his
eyes
and
endeavouring
to
masticate
a
piece
of
bread
with
his
toothless
gums
i
declare
i
fancied
you
were
dead
antonitch
die
first
i
will
follow
you
i
sat
down
beside
them
on
my
right
two
convicts
were
conversing
with
an
attempt
at
dignity
i
am
not
likely
to
be
robbed
said
one
of
them
i
am
more
afraid
of
stealing
myself
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
to
rob
me
the
devil
i
should
pay
the
man
out
but
what
would
you
do
you
are
only
a
convict
we
have
no
other
name
you
will
see
that
she
will
rob
you
the
wretch
without
even
saying
you
the
money
i
gave
her
was
wasted
just
fancy
she
was
here
a
few
days
ago
where
were
we
to
go
shall
i
ask
permission
to
go
into
the
house
of
theodore
the
executioner
he
has
still
his
house
in
the
suburb
the
one
he
bought
from
that
solomon
you
know
that
scurvy
jew
who
hung
himself
not
long
since
yes
i
know
him
the
one
who
sold
liquor
here
three
years
ago
and
who
was
called
grichka
the
shop
i
know
brag
you
do
know
in
the
first
place
it
is
another
drinking
shop
what
do
you
mean
another
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
will
bring
you
as
many
witnesses
as
you
like
oh
you
will
bring
them
will
you
who
are
you
do
you
know
to
whom
you
are
speaking
yes
indeed
i
have
often
thrashed
you
though
i
do
boast
of
it
do
not
give
yourself
airs
then
you
have
thrashed
me
the
man
who
will
thrash
me
is
not
yet
born
and
the
man
who
did
thrash
me
is
six
feet
beneath
the
ground
rascal
of
bender
may
the
siberian
leprosy
devour
you
with
ulcers
may
a
chopper
cleave
your
dog
of
a
head
insults
were
falling
about
like
rain
come
now
they
are
going
to
fight
when
men
have
not
been
able
to
conduct
themselves
properly
they
should
keep
silent
they
are
too
glad
to
come
and
eat
the
government
bread
the
rascals
they
were
soon
separated
let
them
fight
with
the
tongue
as
much
as
they
wish
that
is
permitted
it
is
a
diversion
at
the
service
of
every
one
but
no
blows
it
is
indeed
only
in
extraordinary
cases
that
blows
were
exchanged
if
a
fight
took
place
information
was
given
to
the
major
who
ordered
an
inquiry
or
directed
one
himself
and
then
woe
to
the
convicts
accordingly
they
set
their
faces
against
anything
like
a
serious
quarrel
besides
they
insulted
one
another
chiefly
to
pass
the
time
as
an
oratorical
exercise
they
get
excited
the
quarrel
takes
a
furious
ferocious
character
they
seem
about
to
slaughter
one
another
nothing
of
the
kind
takes
place
as
soon
as
their
anger
has
reached
a
certain
pitch
they
separate
that
astonished
me
much
and
if
i
relate
some
of
the
conversations
between
the
convicts
i
do
so
with
a
purpose
could
i
have
imagined
that
people
could
have
insulted
one
another
for
pleasure
that
they
could
find
enjoyment
in
it
we
must
not
forget
the
gratification
of
vanity
a
dialectician
who
knows
how
to
insult
artistically
is
respected
a
little
more
and
he
would
be
applauded
like
an
actor
already
the
night
before
i
noticed
some
glances
in
my
direction
on
the
other
hand
several
convicts
hung
around
me
as
if
they
had
suspected
that
i
had
brought
money
with
me
they
endeavoured
to
get
into
my
good
graces
by
teaching
me
how
to
carry
my
irons
without
being
incommoded
they
also
gave
me
of
course
in
return
for
money
a
box
with
a
lock
in
order
to
keep
safe
the
things
which
had
been
entrusted
to
me
by
the
administration
and
the
few
shirts
that
i
had
been
allowed
to
bring
with
me
to
the
convict
prison
not
later
than
next
morning
these
same
prisoners
stole
my
box
and
drank
the
money
which
they
had
taken
out
of
it
one
of
them
became
afterwards
a
great
friend
of
mine
though
he
robbed
me
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
itself
he
was
all
the
same
vexed
at
what
he
had
done
he
committed
these
thefts
almost
unconsciously
as
if
in
the
way
of
a
duty
consequently
i
bore
him
no
grudge
these
convicts
let
me
know
that
one
could
have
tea
and
that
i
should
do
well
to
get
myself
a
teapot
they
found
me
one
which
i
hired
for
a
certain
time
they
also
recommended
me
a
cook
who
for
thirty
kopecks
a
month
would
arrange
the
dishes
i
might
desire
if
it
was
my
intention
to
buy
provisions
and
take
my
meals
apart
of
course
they
borrowed
money
from
me
the
day
of
my
arrival
they
asked
me
for
some
at
three
different
times
the
noblemen
degraded
from
their
position
here
incarcerated
in
the
convict
prison
were
badly
looked
upon
by
their
fellow
prisoners
although
they
had
lost
all
their
rights
like
the
other
convicts
they
were
not
looked
upon
as
comrades
in
this
instinctive
repugnance
there
was
a
sort
of
reason
to
them
we
were
always
gentlemen
although
they
often
laughed
at
our
fall
ah
it
all
over
now
mossieu
carriage
formerly
crushed
the
at
moscow
now
mossieu
picks
hemp
they
knew
our
sufferings
though
we
hid
them
as
much
as
possible
it
was
above
all
when
we
were
all
working
together
that
we
had
most
to
endure
for
our
strength
was
not
so
great
as
theirs
and
we
were
really
not
of
much
assistance
to
them
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
gain
the
confidence
of
the
common
people
above
all
such
people
as
these
there
were
only
a
few
of
us
who
were
of
noble
birth
in
the
whole
prison
first
there
were
five
poles
of
whom
further
on
i
shall
speak
in
detail
they
were
detested
by
the
convicts
more
perhaps
than
the
russian
nobles
the
poles
i
speak
only
of
the
political
convicts
always
behaved
to
them
with
a
constrained
and
offensive
politeness
scarcely
ever
speaking
to
them
and
making
no
endeavour
to
conceal
the
disgust
which
they
experienced
in
such
company
the
convicts
understood
all
this
and
paid
them
back
in
their
own
coin
two
years
passed
before
i
could
gain
the
of
my
companions
but
the
greater
part
of
them
were
attached
to
me
and
declared
that
i
was
a
good
fellow
there
were
altogether
counting
myself
five
russian
nobles
in
the
convict
prison
i
had
heard
of
one
of
them
even
before
my
arrival
as
a
vile
and
base
creature
horribly
corrupt
doing
the
work
of
spy
and
informer
accordingly
from
the
very
first
day
i
refused
to
enter
into
relations
with
this
man
the
second
was
the
parricide
of
whom
i
have
spoken
in
these
memoirs
the
third
was
akimitch
i
have
scarcely
ever
seen
such
an
original
and
i
have
still
a
lively
recollection
of
him
tall
thin
and
terribly
ignorant
he
was
as
argumentative
and
as
particular
about
details
as
a
german
the
convicts
laughed
at
him
but
they
feared
him
on
account
of
his
susceptible
excitable
and
quarrelsome
disposition
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
was
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
with
them
he
insulted
them
and
beat
them
phenomenally
just
it
was
sufficient
for
him
that
there
was
injustice
to
interfere
in
an
affair
which
did
not
concern
him
he
was
moreover
exceedingly
simple
when
he
quarrelled
with
the
convicts
he
reproached
them
with
being
thieves
and
exhorted
them
in
all
sincerity
to
steal
no
more
he
had
served
as
a
in
the
caucasus
i
made
friends
with
him
the
first
day
and
he
related
to
me
his
affair
he
had
begun
as
a
cadet
in
a
line
regiment
after
waiting
some
time
to
be
appointed
to
his
commission
as
he
at
last
received
it
and
was
sent
into
the
mountains
to
command
a
small
fort
a
small
tributary
prince
in
the
neighbourhood
set
fire
to
the
fort
and
made
a
night
attack
which
had
no
success
akimitch
was
very
cunning
and
pretended
not
to
know
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
attack
which
he
attributed
to
some
insurgents
wandering
about
the
mountains
after
a
month
he
invited
the
prince
in
a
friendly
way
to
come
and
see
him
the
prince
arrived
on
horseback
without
suspecting
anything
akimitch
drew
up
his
garrison
in
line
of
battle
and
exposed
to
the
soldiers
the
treason
and
villainy
of
his
visitor
he
reproached
him
with
his
conduct
proved
to
him
that
to
set
fire
to
the
fort
was
a
shameful
crime
explained
to
him
minutely
the
duties
of
a
tributary
prince
and
then
by
way
of
peroration
to
his
harangue
had
him
shot
he
at
once
informed
his
superior
officers
of
this
execution
with
all
the
details
necessary
thereupon
akimitch
was
brought
to
trial
he
appeared
before
a
and
was
condemned
to
death
but
his
sentence
was
commuted
and
he
was
sent
to
siberia
as
a
convict
of
the
second
class
condemned
that
is
to
say
to
twelve
years
hard
labour
and
imprisonment
in
a
fortress
he
admitted
willingly
that
he
had
acted
illegally
and
that
the
prince
ought
to
have
been
tried
in
a
civil
court
and
not
by
a
nevertheless
he
could
not
understand
that
his
action
was
a
crime
he
had
burned
my
fort
what
was
i
to
do
was
i
to
thank
him
for
it
he
answered
to
my
objections
although
the
convicts
laughed
at
akimitch
and
pretended
that
he
was
a
little
mad
they
esteemed
him
all
the
same
by
reason
of
his
cleverness
and
his
precision
he
knew
all
possible
trades
and
could
do
whatever
you
wished
he
was
cobbler
bootmaker
painter
carver
gilder
and
locksmith
he
had
acquired
these
talents
at
the
convict
prison
for
it
was
sufficient
for
him
to
see
an
object
in
order
to
imitate
it
he
sold
in
the
town
or
caused
to
be
sold
baskets
lanterns
and
toys
thanks
to
his
work
he
had
always
some
money
which
he
employed
in
buying
shirts
pillows
and
so
on
he
had
himself
made
a
mattress
and
as
he
slept
in
the
same
room
as
myself
he
was
very
useful
to
me
at
the
beginning
of
my
imprisonment
before
leaving
prison
to
go
to
work
the
convicts
were
drawn
up
in
two
ranks
before
the
surrounded
by
an
escort
of
soldiers
with
loaded
muskets
an
officer
of
engineers
then
arrived
with
the
superintendent
of
the
works
and
a
few
soldiers
who
watched
the
operations
the
superintendent
counted
the
convicts
and
sent
them
in
bands
to
the
places
where
they
were
to
be
occupied
i
went
with
some
other
prisoners
to
the
workshop
of
the
engineers
a
low
brick
house
built
in
the
midst
of
a
large
full
of
materials
there
was
a
forge
there
and
carpenters
locksmiths
and
workshops
akimitch
was
assigned
to
the
last
he
boiled
the
oil
for
the
varnish
mixed
the
colours
and
painted
tables
and
other
pieces
of
furniture
in
imitation
walnut
while
i
was
waiting
to
have
additional
irons
put
on
i
communicated
to
him
my
first
impressions
yes
he
said
they
do
not
like
nobles
above
all
those
who
have
been
condemned
for
political
offences
and
they
take
a
pleasure
in
wounding
their
feelings
is
it
not
intelligible
we
do
not
belong
to
them
we
do
not
suit
them
they
have
all
been
serfs
or
soldiers
tell
me
what
sympathy
can
they
have
for
us
the
life
here
is
hard
but
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
that
of
the
disciplinary
companies
in
russia
there
it
is
hell
the
men
who
have
been
in
them
praise
our
convict
prison
it
is
paradise
compared
to
their
purgatory
not
that
the
work
is
harder
it
is
said
that
with
the
convicts
of
the
first
class
the
administration
it
is
not
exclusively
military
as
it
is
here
acts
quite
differently
from
what
it
does
towards
us
they
have
their
little
houses
there
i
have
been
told
for
i
have
not
seen
for
myself
they
wear
no
uniform
their
heads
are
not
shaved
though
in
my
opinion
uniforms
and
shaved
heads
are
not
bad
things
it
is
neater
and
also
it
is
more
agreeable
to
the
eye
only
these
men
do
not
like
it
oh
what
a
babel
this
place
is
soldiers
circassians
old
believers
peasants
who
have
left
their
wives
and
families
jews
gypsies
people
come
from
heaven
knows
where
and
all
this
variety
of
men
are
to
live
quietly
together
side
by
side
eat
from
the
same
dish
and
sleep
on
the
same
planks
not
a
moment
liberty
no
enjoyment
except
in
secret
they
must
hide
their
money
in
their
boots
and
then
always
the
convict
prison
at
every
moment
perpetually
convict
prison
involuntarily
wild
ideas
come
to
one
as
i
already
knew
all
this
i
was
above
all
anxious
to
question
akimitch
in
regard
to
our
major
he
concealed
nothing
and
the
impression
which
his
story
left
upon
me
was
far
from
being
an
agreeable
one
i
had
to
live
for
two
years
under
the
authority
of
this
officer
all
that
akimitch
had
told
me
about
him
was
strictly
true
he
was
a
spiteful
man
terrible
above
all
things
because
he
possessed
almost
absolute
power
over
two
hundred
human
beings
he
looked
upon
the
prisoners
as
his
personal
enemies
first
and
very
serious
fault
his
rare
capacities
and
perhaps
even
his
good
qualities
were
perverted
by
his
intemperance
and
his
spitefulness
he
sometimes
fell
like
a
bombshell
into
the
barracks
in
the
middle
of
the
night
if
he
noticed
a
prisoner
asleep
on
his
back
or
his
left
side
he
awoke
him
and
said
to
him
you
must
sleep
as
i
ordered
the
convicts
detested
him
and
feared
him
like
the
plague
his
repulsive
crimson
countenance
made
every
one
tremble
we
all
knew
that
the
major
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
his
servant
fedka
and
that
he
had
nearly
gone
mad
when
his
dog
treasure
fell
ill
he
preferred
this
dog
to
every
other
living
creature
when
fedka
told
him
that
a
convict
who
had
picked
up
some
veterinary
knowledge
made
wonderful
cures
he
sent
for
him
directly
and
said
to
him
i
entrust
my
dog
to
your
care
if
you
cure
i
will
reward
you
royally
the
man
a
very
intelligent
siberian
peasant
was
indeed
a
good
veterinary
surgeon
but
he
was
above
all
a
cunning
peasant
he
used
to
tell
his
comrades
long
after
the
affair
had
taken
place
the
story
of
his
visit
to
the
major
i
looked
at
he
was
lying
down
on
a
sofa
with
his
head
on
a
white
cushion
i
saw
at
once
that
he
had
inflammation
and
that
he
wanted
bleeding
i
think
i
could
have
cured
him
but
i
said
to
myself
will
happen
if
the
dog
dies
it
will
be
my
fault
your
noble
highness
i
said
to
him
have
called
me
too
late
if
i
had
seen
your
dog
yesterday
or
the
day
before
he
would
now
be
restored
to
health
but
at
the
present
moment
i
can
do
nothing
he
will
die
and
died
i
was
told
one
day
that
a
convict
had
tried
to
kill
the
major
this
prisoner
had
for
several
years
been
noticed
for
his
submissive
attitude
and
also
his
silence
he
was
regarded
even
as
a
madman
as
he
possessed
some
instruction
he
passed
his
nights
reading
the
bible
when
everybody
was
asleep
he
rose
climbed
up
on
to
the
stove
lit
a
church
taper
opened
his
gospel
and
began
to
read
he
did
this
for
an
entire
year
one
fine
day
he
left
the
ranks
and
declared
that
he
would
not
go
to
work
he
was
reported
to
the
major
who
flew
into
a
rage
and
hurried
to
the
barracks
the
convict
rushed
forward
and
hurled
at
him
a
brick
which
he
had
procured
beforehand
but
it
missed
him
the
prisoner
was
seized
tried
and
whipped
it
was
a
matter
of
a
few
moments
carried
to
the
hospital
and
died
there
three
days
afterwards
he
declared
during
his
last
moments
that
he
hated
no
one
but
that
he
had
wished
to
suffer
he
belonged
to
no
sect
of
fanatics
afterwards
when
people
spoke
of
him
in
the
barracks
it
was
always
with
respect
at
last
they
put
new
irons
on
me
while
they
were
being
soldered
a
number
of
young
women
selling
little
white
loaves
came
into
the
forge
one
after
another
they
were
for
the
most
part
quite
little
girls
who
came
to
sell
the
loaves
that
their
mothers
had
baked
as
they
got
older
they
still
continued
to
hang
about
us
but
they
no
longer
brought
bread
there
were
always
some
of
them
about
there
were
also
married
women
each
roll
cost
two
kopecks
nearly
all
the
prisoners
used
to
have
them
i
noticed
a
prisoner
who
worked
as
a
carpenter
he
was
already
getting
gray
but
he
had
a
ruddy
smiling
complexion
he
was
joking
with
the
vendors
of
rolls
before
they
arrived
he
had
tied
a
red
handkerchief
round
his
neck
a
fat
woman
much
marked
with
the
put
down
her
basket
on
the
carpenter
table
they
began
to
talk
why
did
you
not
come
yesterday
said
the
convict
with
a
smile
i
did
come
but
you
had
gone
replied
the
woman
boldly
yes
they
made
us
go
away
otherwise
we
should
have
met
the
day
before
yesterday
they
all
came
to
see
me
who
came
why
mariashka
khavroshka
tchekunda
dougrochva
the
woman
of
four
kopecks
what
i
said
to
akimitch
is
it
possible
that
yes
it
happens
sometimes
he
replied
lowering
his
eyes
for
he
was
a
very
proper
man
yes
it
happened
sometimes
but
rarely
and
with
unheard
of
difficulties
the
convicts
preferred
to
spend
their
money
in
drink
it
was
very
difficult
to
meet
these
women
it
was
necessary
to
come
to
an
agreement
about
the
place
and
the
time
to
arrange
a
meeting
to
find
solitude
and
what
was
most
difficult
of
all
to
avoid
the
escorts
almost
an
impossibility
and
to
spend
relatively
prodigious
sums
i
have
sometimes
however
witnessed
love
scenes
one
day
three
of
us
were
heating
a
on
the
banks
of
the
irtitch
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
were
fellows
two
blowers
they
were
soon
appeared
where
were
you
staying
so
long
said
a
prisoner
to
them
who
had
evidently
been
expecting
them
was
it
at
the
zvierkoffs
that
you
were
detained
at
the
zvierkoffs
it
will
be
fine
weather
and
the
fowls
will
have
teeth
when
i
go
to
see
them
replied
one
of
the
women
she
was
the
dirtiest
woman
imaginable
she
was
called
tchekunda
and
had
arrived
in
company
with
her
friend
the
four
kopecks
who
was
beneath
all
description
it
a
long
time
since
we
have
seen
anything
of
you
says
the
gallant
to
her
of
the
four
kopecks
you
seem
to
have
grown
thinner
perhaps
formerly
i
was
and
plump
whereas
now
one
might
fancy
i
had
swallowed
eels
and
you
still
run
after
the
soldiers
is
that
so
all
calumny
on
the
part
of
wicked
people
and
after
all
if
i
was
to
be
flogged
to
death
for
it
i
like
soldiers
never
mind
your
soldiers
we
the
people
to
love
we
have
money
imagine
this
gallant
with
his
shaved
crown
with
fetters
on
his
ankles
dressed
in
a
coat
of
two
colours
and
watched
by
an
escort
as
i
was
now
returning
to
the
prison
my
irons
had
been
put
on
i
wished
akimitch
and
went
away
escorted
by
a
soldier
those
who
do
task
work
return
first
and
when
i
got
back
to
the
barracks
a
good
number
of
convicts
were
already
there
as
the
kitchen
could
not
have
held
the
whole
at
once
we
did
not
all
dine
together
those
who
came
in
first
were
first
served
i
tasted
the
cabbage
soup
but
not
being
used
to
it
could
not
eat
it
and
i
prepared
myself
some
tea
i
sat
down
at
one
end
of
the
table
with
a
convict
of
noble
birth
like
myself
the
prisoners
were
going
in
and
out
there
was
no
want
of
room
for
there
were
not
many
of
them
five
of
them
sat
down
apart
from
the
large
table
the
cook
gave
them
each
two
ladles
full
of
soup
and
brought
them
a
plate
of
fried
fish
these
men
were
having
a
holiday
they
looked
at
us
in
a
friendly
manner
one
of
the
poles
came
in
and
took
his
seat
by
our
side
i
was
not
with
you
but
i
know
that
you
are
having
a
feast
exclaimed
a
tall
convict
who
now
came
in
he
was
a
man
of
about
fifty
years
thin
and
muscular
his
face
indicated
cunning
and
at
the
same
time
liveliness
his
lower
lip
fleshy
and
pendant
gave
him
a
soft
expression
well
have
you
slept
well
why
do
you
say
how
do
you
do
well
now
my
friends
of
kursk
he
said
sitting
down
by
the
side
of
the
feasters
good
appetite
here
a
new
guest
for
you
we
are
not
from
the
province
of
kursk
then
my
friends
from
tambof
let
me
say
we
are
not
from
tambof
either
you
have
nothing
to
claim
from
us
if
you
want
to
enjoy
yourself
go
to
some
rich
peasant
i
have
maria
ikotishna
from
ikot
hiccough
in
my
belly
otherwise
i
should
die
of
hunger
but
where
is
your
peasant
to
be
found
good
heavens
we
mean
gazin
go
to
him
gazin
is
on
the
drink
he
devouring
his
capital
he
has
at
least
twenty
roubles
says
another
convict
it
is
profitable
to
keep
a
drinking
shop
you
wo
have
me
then
i
must
eat
the
government
food
will
you
have
some
tea
if
so
ask
these
noblemen
for
some
where
do
you
see
any
noblemen
they
noblemen
no
longer
they
not
a
bit
better
than
us
said
in
a
sombre
voice
a
convict
who
was
seated
in
the
corner
who
hitherto
had
not
risked
a
word
i
should
like
a
cup
of
tea
but
i
am
ashamed
to
ask
for
it
i
have
said
the
convict
with
the
heavy
lip
looking
at
me
with
a
air
i
will
give
you
some
if
you
like
i
said
will
you
have
some
what
do
you
mean
will
i
have
some
who
would
not
have
some
he
said
coming
towards
the
table
only
think
when
he
was
free
he
ate
nothing
but
cabbage
soup
and
black
bread
but
now
he
is
in
prison
he
must
have
tea
like
a
perfect
gentleman
continued
the
convict
with
the
sombre
air
does
no
one
here
drink
tea
i
asked
him
but
he
did
not
think
me
worthy
of
a
reply
white
rolls
white
rolls
who
buy
a
young
prisoner
was
carrying
in
a
net
a
load
of
calachi
scones
which
he
proposed
to
sell
in
the
prison
for
every
ten
that
he
sold
the
baker
gave
him
one
for
his
trouble
it
was
precisely
on
this
tenth
scone
that
he
counted
for
his
dinner
white
rolls
white
rolls
he
cried
as
he
entered
the
kitchen
white
moscow
rolls
all
hot
i
would
eat
the
whole
of
them
but
i
want
money
lots
of
money
come
lads
there
is
only
one
left
for
any
of
you
who
has
had
a
mother
this
appeal
to
filial
love
made
every
one
laugh
and
several
of
his
white
rolls
were
purchased
well
he
said
gazin
has
drunk
in
such
a
style
it
is
quite
a
sin
he
has
chosen
a
nice
moment
too
if
the
man
with
the
eight
eyes
should
arrive
we
shall
hide
him
is
he
very
drunk
yes
and
too
unmanageable
there
will
be
some
fighting
then
whom
are
they
speaking
of
i
said
to
the
pole
my
neighbour
of
gazin
he
is
a
prisoner
who
sells
spirits
when
he
has
gained
a
little
money
by
his
trade
he
drinks
it
to
the
last
kopeck
a
cruel
malicious
animal
when
he
has
been
drinking
when
sober
he
is
quiet
enough
but
when
he
is
in
drink
he
shows
himself
in
his
true
character
he
attacks
people
with
the
knife
until
it
is
taken
from
him
how
do
they
manage
that
ten
men
throw
themselves
upon
him
and
beat
him
like
a
sack
without
mercy
until
he
loses
consciousness
when
he
is
half
dead
with
the
beating
they
lay
him
down
on
his
plank
bedstead
and
cover
him
over
with
his
pelisse
but
they
might
kill
him
any
one
else
would
die
of
it
but
not
he
he
is
excessively
robust
he
is
the
strongest
of
all
the
convicts
his
constitution
is
so
solid
that
the
day
after
one
of
these
punishments
he
gets
up
perfectly
sound
tell
me
please
i
continued
speaking
to
the
pole
why
these
people
keep
their
food
to
themselves
and
at
the
same
time
seem
to
envy
me
my
tea
your
tea
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
they
are
envious
of
you
are
you
not
a
gentleman
you
in
no
way
resemble
them
they
would
be
glad
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
you
in
order
to
humiliate
you
you
do
know
what
annoyances
you
will
have
to
undergo
it
is
martyrdom
for
men
like
us
to
be
here
our
life
is
doubly
painful
and
great
strength
of
character
can
alone
accustom
one
to
it
you
will
be
vexed
and
tormented
in
all
sorts
of
ways
on
account
of
your
food
and
your
tea
although
the
number
of
men
who
buy
their
own
food
and
drink
tea
daily
is
large
enough
they
have
a
right
to
do
so
you
have
not
he
got
up
and
left
the
table
a
few
minutes
later
his
predictions
were
already
being
fulfilled
chapter
iv
first
impressions
hardly
had
cki
the
pole
to
whom
i
had
been
speaking
gone
out
when
gazin
completely
drunk
threw
himself
all
in
a
heap
into
the
kitchen
to
see
a
convict
drunk
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
every
one
was
about
to
be
sent
out
to
work
given
the
severity
of
the
major
who
at
any
moment
might
come
to
the
barracks
the
watchfulness
of
the
under
officer
who
never
left
the
prison
the
presence
of
the
old
soldiers
and
the
sentinels
all
this
quite
upset
the
ideas
i
had
formed
of
our
prison
and
a
long
time
passed
before
i
was
able
to
understand
and
explain
to
myself
the
effects
which
in
the
first
instance
were
enigmatic
indeed
i
have
already
said
that
all
the
convicts
had
a
private
occupation
and
that
this
occupation
was
for
them
a
natural
and
imperious
one
they
are
passionately
fond
of
money
and
think
more
of
it
than
of
anything
else
almost
as
much
as
of
liberty
the
convict
is
if
he
can
ring
a
few
kopecks
in
his
pocket
on
the
contrary
he
is
sad
restless
and
despondent
if
he
has
no
money
he
is
ready
then
to
commit
no
matter
what
crime
in
order
to
get
some
nevertheless
in
spite
of
the
importance
it
possesses
for
the
convicts
money
does
not
remain
long
in
their
pockets
it
is
difficult
to
keep
it
sometimes
it
is
confiscated
sometimes
stolen
when
the
major
in
a
sudden
perquisition
discovered
a
small
sum
amassed
with
great
trouble
he
confiscated
it
it
may
be
that
he
laid
it
out
in
improving
the
food
of
the
prisoners
for
all
the
money
taken
from
them
went
into
his
hands
but
generally
speaking
it
was
stolen
a
means
of
preserving
it
was
however
discovered
an
old
man
from
starodoub
one
of
the
old
believers
took
upon
himself
to
conceal
the
convicts
savings
i
can
not
resist
my
desire
to
say
some
words
about
this
man
although
it
takes
me
away
from
my
story
he
was
about
sixty
years
old
thin
and
getting
very
gray
he
excited
my
curiosity
the
first
time
i
saw
him
for
he
was
not
like
any
of
the
others
his
look
was
so
tranquil
and
mild
and
i
always
saw
with
pleasure
his
clear
and
limpid
eyes
surrounded
by
a
number
of
little
wrinkles
i
often
talked
with
him
and
rarely
have
i
met
with
so
kind
so
benevolent
a
being
he
had
been
consigned
to
hard
labour
for
a
serious
crime
a
certain
number
of
the
old
believers
at
starodoub
had
been
converted
to
the
orthodox
religion
the
government
had
done
everything
to
encourage
them
and
at
the
same
time
to
convert
the
other
dissenters
the
old
man
and
some
other
fanatics
had
resolved
to
defend
the
faith
when
the
orthodox
church
was
being
constructed
in
their
town
they
set
fire
to
the
building
this
offence
had
brought
upon
its
author
the
sentence
of
deportation
this
shopkeeper
he
was
in
trade
had
left
a
wife
and
family
whom
he
loved
and
had
gone
off
courageously
into
exile
believing
in
his
blindness
that
he
was
suffering
for
the
faith
when
one
had
lived
some
time
by
the
side
of
this
kind
old
man
one
could
not
help
asking
the
question
how
could
he
have
rebelled
i
spoke
to
him
several
times
about
his
faith
he
gave
up
none
of
his
convictions
but
in
his
answers
i
never
noticed
the
slightest
hatred
and
yet
he
had
destroyed
a
church
and
was
far
from
denying
it
in
his
view
the
offence
he
had
committed
and
his
martyrdom
were
things
to
be
proud
of
there
were
other
old
believers
among
the
convicts
siberians
for
the
most
part
men
of
intelligence
and
as
cunning
as
all
peasants
dialecticians
in
their
way
they
followed
blindly
their
law
and
delighted
in
discussing
it
but
they
had
great
faults
they
were
haughty
proud
and
very
intolerant
the
old
man
in
no
way
resembled
them
with
full
more
belief
in
religious
exposition
than
others
of
the
same
faith
he
avoided
all
controversy
as
he
was
of
a
gay
and
expansive
disposition
he
often
laughed
not
with
the
coarse
cynical
laugh
of
the
other
convicts
but
with
a
laugh
of
clearness
and
simplicity
in
which
there
was
something
of
the
child
and
which
harmonised
perfectly
with
his
gray
head
i
may
perhaps
be
in
error
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
man
may
be
known
by
his
laugh
alone
if
the
laugh
of
a
man
you
are
acquainted
with
inspires
you
with
sympathy
be
assured
that
he
is
an
honest
man
the
old
man
had
acquired
the
respect
of
all
the
prisoners
without
exception
but
he
was
not
proud
of
it
the
convicts
called
him
grandfather
and
he
took
no
offence
i
then
understood
what
an
influence
he
must
have
exercised
on
his
in
spite
of
the
firmness
with
which
he
supported
his
prison
life
one
felt
that
he
was
tormented
by
a
profound
incurable
melancholy
i
slept
in
the
same
barrack
with
him
one
night
towards
three
in
the
morning
i
woke
up
i
heard
a
slow
stifling
sob
the
old
man
was
sitting
upon
the
stove
the
same
place
where
the
convict
who
had
wished
to
kill
the
major
was
in
the
habit
of
praying
and
was
reading
from
his
manuscript
as
he
wept
i
heard
him
repeating
lord
do
not
forsake
me
master
strengthen
me
my
poor
little
children
my
dear
little
children
we
shall
never
see
one
another
again
i
can
not
say
how
much
this
moved
me
we
used
to
give
our
money
then
to
this
old
man
heaven
knows
how
the
idea
got
abroad
in
our
barrack
that
he
could
not
be
robbed
it
was
well
known
that
he
hid
somewhere
the
savings
deposited
with
him
but
no
one
had
been
able
to
discover
his
secret
he
revealed
it
to
us
to
the
poles
and
myself
one
of
the
stakes
of
the
palisade
bore
a
branch
which
apparently
belonged
to
it
but
it
could
be
taken
away
and
then
replaced
in
the
stake
when
the
branch
was
removed
a
hole
could
be
seen
this
was
the
in
question
i
now
resume
the
thread
of
my
narrative
why
does
not
the
convict
save
up
his
money
not
only
is
it
difficult
for
him
to
keep
it
but
the
prison
life
moreover
is
so
sad
that
the
convict
by
his
very
nature
thirsts
for
freedom
of
action
by
his
position
in
society
he
is
so
irregular
a
being
that
the
idea
of
swallowing
up
his
capital
in
orgies
of
intoxicating
himself
with
revelry
seems
to
him
quite
natural
if
only
he
can
procure
himself
one
moment
forgetfulness
it
was
strange
to
see
certain
individuals
bent
over
their
labour
only
with
the
object
of
spending
in
one
day
all
their
gains
even
to
the
last
kopeck
then
they
would
go
to
work
again
until
a
new
debauch
looked
forward
to
months
beforehand
certain
convicts
were
fond
of
new
clothes
more
or
less
singular
in
style
such
as
fancy
trousers
and
waistcoats
but
it
was
above
all
for
the
coloured
shirts
that
the
convicts
had
a
pronounced
taste
also
for
belts
with
metal
clasps
on
holidays
the
dandies
of
the
prison
put
on
their
sunday
best
they
were
worth
seeing
as
they
strutted
about
their
part
of
the
barracks
the
pleasure
of
feeling
themselves
well
dressed
amounted
with
them
to
childishness
indeed
in
many
things
convicts
are
only
children
their
fine
clothes
disappeared
very
soon
often
the
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
they
had
been
bought
their
owners
pledged
them
or
sold
them
again
for
a
trifle
the
feasts
were
generally
held
at
fixed
times
they
coincided
with
religious
festivals
or
with
the
name
day
of
the
drunken
convict
on
getting
up
in
the
morning
he
would
place
a
wax
taper
before
the
holy
image
then
he
said
his
prayer
dressed
and
ordered
his
dinner
he
had
bought
beforehand
meat
fish
and
little
patties
then
he
gorged
like
an
ox
almost
always
alone
it
was
very
rare
to
see
a
convict
invite
another
convict
to
share
his
repast
at
dinner
the
vodka
was
produced
the
convict
would
suck
it
up
like
the
sole
of
a
boot
and
then
walk
through
the
barracks
swaggering
and
tottering
it
was
his
desire
to
show
all
his
companions
that
he
was
drunk
that
he
was
carrying
on
and
thus
obtain
their
particular
esteem
the
russian
people
feel
always
a
certain
sympathy
for
a
drunken
man
among
us
it
amounted
really
to
esteem
in
the
convict
prison
intoxication
was
a
sort
of
aristocratic
distinction
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
in
spirits
the
convict
ordered
a
musician
we
had
among
us
a
little
fellow
a
deserter
from
the
army
very
ugly
but
who
was
the
happy
possessor
of
a
violin
on
which
he
could
play
as
he
had
no
trade
he
was
always
ready
to
follow
the
festive
convict
from
barrack
to
barrack
grinding
him
out
dance
tunes
with
all
his
strength
his
countenance
often
expressed
the
fatigue
and
disgust
which
his
music
always
the
same
caused
him
but
when
the
prisoner
called
out
to
him
go
on
playing
are
you
not
paid
for
it
he
attacked
his
violin
more
violently
than
ever
these
drunkards
felt
sure
that
they
would
be
taken
care
of
and
in
case
of
the
major
arriving
would
be
concealed
from
his
watchful
eyes
this
service
we
rendered
in
the
most
disinterested
spirit
on
their
side
the
under
officer
and
the
old
soldiers
who
remained
in
the
prison
to
keep
order
were
perfectly
reassured
the
drunkard
would
cause
no
disturbance
at
the
least
scare
of
revolt
or
riot
he
would
have
been
quieted
and
then
bound
accordingly
the
inferior
officers
closed
their
eyes
they
knew
that
if
vodka
was
forbidden
all
would
go
wrong
how
was
this
vodka
procured
it
was
bought
in
the
convict
prison
itself
from
the
as
they
were
called
who
followed
this
trade
a
very
lucrative
one
although
the
tipplers
were
not
very
numerous
for
revelry
was
expensive
especially
when
it
is
considered
how
hardly
money
was
earned
the
drink
business
was
begun
continued
and
ended
in
rather
an
original
manner
the
prisoner
who
knew
no
trade
would
not
work
and
who
nevertheless
desired
to
get
speedily
rich
made
up
his
mind
when
he
possessed
a
little
money
to
buy
and
sell
vodka
the
enterprise
was
risky
it
required
great
daring
for
the
speculator
hazarded
his
skin
as
well
as
liquor
but
the
hesitated
before
no
obstacles
at
the
outset
he
brought
the
vodka
himself
to
the
prison
and
got
rid
of
it
on
the
most
advantageous
terms
he
repeated
this
operation
a
second
and
a
third
time
if
he
had
not
been
discovered
by
the
officials
he
now
possessed
a
sum
which
enabled
him
to
extend
his
business
he
became
a
capitalist
with
agents
and
assistants
he
risked
much
less
and
gained
much
more
then
his
assistants
incurred
risk
in
place
of
him
prisons
are
always
abundantly
inhabited
by
ruined
men
without
the
habit
of
work
but
endowed
with
skill
and
daring
their
only
capital
is
their
back
they
often
decide
to
put
it
into
circulation
and
propose
to
the
to
introduce
vodka
into
the
barracks
there
is
always
in
the
town
a
soldier
a
shopkeeper
or
some
loose
woman
who
for
a
stipulated
sum
rather
a
small
one
buys
vodka
with
the
money
hides
it
in
a
place
known
to
the
near
the
workshop
where
he
is
employed
the
person
who
supplies
the
vodka
tastes
the
precious
liquid
almost
always
as
he
is
carrying
it
to
the
and
replaces
relentlessly
what
he
has
drunk
by
pure
water
the
purchaser
may
take
it
or
leave
it
but
he
can
not
give
himself
airs
he
thinks
himself
very
lucky
that
his
money
has
not
been
stolen
from
him
and
that
he
has
received
some
kind
of
vodka
in
exchange
the
man
who
is
to
take
it
into
the
prison
to
whom
the
has
indicated
the
goes
to
the
supplier
with
intestines
which
after
being
washed
have
been
filled
with
water
and
which
thus
preserves
their
softness
and
suppleness
when
the
intestines
have
been
filled
with
vodka
the
smuggler
rolls
them
round
his
body
now
all
the
cunning
the
adroitness
of
this
daring
convict
is
shown
the
man
honour
is
at
stake
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
take
in
the
escort
and
the
man
on
guard
and
he
will
take
them
in
if
the
carrier
is
artful
the
soldier
of
the
escort
sometimes
a
recruit
does
not
notice
anything
particular
for
the
prisoner
has
studied
him
thoroughly
besides
which
he
has
artfully
combined
the
hour
and
the
place
of
meeting
if
the
convict
a
bricklayer
for
example
climbs
up
on
the
wall
that
he
is
building
the
escort
will
certainly
not
climb
up
after
him
to
watch
his
movements
who
then
will
see
what
he
is
about
on
getting
near
the
prison
he
gets
ready
a
piece
of
fifteen
or
twenty
kopecks
and
waits
at
the
gate
for
the
corporal
on
guard
the
corporal
examines
feels
and
searches
each
convict
on
his
return
to
the
barracks
and
then
opens
the
gate
to
him
the
carrier
of
the
vodka
hopes
that
he
will
be
ashamed
to
examine
him
too
much
in
detail
but
if
the
corporal
is
a
cunning
fellow
that
is
just
what
he
will
do
and
in
that
case
he
finds
the
contraband
vodka
the
convict
has
now
only
one
chance
of
salvation
he
slips
into
the
hand
of
the
under
officer
the
piece
of
money
he
holds
in
readiness
and
often
thanks
to
this
manoeuvre
the
vodka
arrives
safely
in
the
hands
of
the
but
sometimes
the
trick
does
not
succeed
and
it
is
then
that
the
sole
capital
of
the
smuggler
enters
really
into
circulation
a
report
is
made
to
the
major
who
sentences
the
unhappy
culprit
to
a
thorough
flogging
as
for
the
vodka
it
is
confiscated
the
smuggler
undergoes
his
punishment
without
betraying
the
speculator
not
because
such
a
denunciation
would
disgrace
him
but
because
it
would
bring
him
nothing
he
would
be
flogged
all
the
same
the
only
consolation
he
could
have
would
be
that
the
would
share
his
punishment
but
as
he
needs
him
he
does
not
denounce
him
although
having
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
he
will
receive
no
payment
from
him
denunciation
however
flourishes
in
the
convict
prison
far
from
hating
spies
or
keeping
apart
from
them
the
prisoners
often
make
friends
of
them
if
any
one
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
prove
to
the
convicts
all
the
baseness
of
mutual
denunciation
no
one
in
the
prison
would
have
understood
the
former
nobleman
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
that
cowardly
and
violent
creature
with
whom
i
had
already
broken
off
all
relations
immediately
after
my
arrival
in
the
fortress
was
the
friend
of
fedka
the
major
he
used
to
tell
him
everything
that
took
place
in
the
convict
prison
and
this
was
naturally
carried
back
to
the
servant
master
every
one
knew
it
but
no
one
had
the
idea
of
showing
any
against
the
man
or
of
reproaching
him
with
his
conduct
when
the
vodka
arrived
without
accident
at
the
prison
the
speculator
paid
the
smuggler
and
made
up
his
accounts
his
merchandise
had
already
cost
him
sufficiently
dear
and
that
the
profit
might
be
greater
he
diluted
it
by
adding
fifty
per
cent
of
pure
water
he
was
ready
and
had
only
to
wait
for
customers
the
first
holiday
perhaps
even
on
a
a
convict
would
turn
up
he
had
been
working
like
a
negro
for
many
months
in
order
to
save
up
kopeck
by
kopeck
a
small
sum
which
he
was
resolved
to
spend
all
at
once
these
days
of
rejoicing
had
been
looked
forward
to
long
beforehand
he
had
dreamt
of
them
during
the
endless
winter
nights
during
his
hardest
labour
and
the
perspective
had
supported
him
under
his
severest
trials
the
dawn
of
this
day
so
impatiently
awaited
has
just
appeared
he
has
some
money
in
his
pocket
it
has
been
neither
stolen
from
him
nor
confiscated
he
is
free
to
spend
it
accordingly
he
takes
his
savings
to
the
who
to
begin
with
gives
vodka
which
is
almost
pure
it
has
been
only
twice
baptized
but
gradually
as
the
bottle
gets
more
and
more
empty
he
fills
it
up
with
water
accordingly
the
convict
pays
for
his
vodka
five
or
six
times
as
much
as
he
would
in
a
tavern
it
may
be
imagined
how
many
glasses
and
above
all
what
sums
of
money
are
required
before
the
convict
is
drunk
however
as
he
has
lost
the
habit
of
drinking
the
little
alcohol
which
remains
in
the
liquid
intoxicates
him
rapidly
enough
he
goes
on
drinking
until
there
is
nothing
left
he
pledges
or
sells
all
his
new
clothes
for
the
is
at
the
same
time
a
pawnbroker
as
his
personal
garments
are
not
very
numerous
he
next
pledges
the
clothes
supplied
to
him
by
the
government
when
the
drink
has
made
away
with
his
last
shirt
his
last
rag
he
lies
down
and
wakes
up
the
next
morning
with
a
bad
headache
in
vain
he
begs
the
to
give
him
credit
for
a
drop
of
vodka
in
order
to
remove
his
depression
he
experiences
a
direct
refusal
that
very
day
he
sets
to
work
again
for
several
months
together
he
will
weary
himself
out
while
looking
forward
to
such
a
debauch
as
the
one
which
has
now
disappeared
in
the
past
little
by
little
he
regains
courage
while
waiting
for
such
another
day
still
far
off
but
which
ultimately
will
arrive
as
for
the
if
he
has
gained
a
large
sum
some
dozen
of
roubles
he
procures
some
more
vodka
but
this
time
he
does
not
baptize
it
because
he
intends
it
for
himself
enough
of
trade
it
is
time
for
him
to
amuse
himself
accordingly
he
eats
drinks
pays
for
a
little
music
his
means
allow
him
to
grease
the
palm
of
the
inferior
officers
in
the
convict
prison
this
festival
lasts
sometimes
for
several
days
when
his
stock
of
vodka
is
exhausted
he
goes
and
drinks
with
the
other
who
are
waiting
for
him
he
then
drinks
up
his
last
kopeck
however
careful
the
convicts
may
be
in
watching
over
their
companions
in
debauchery
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
major
or
the
officer
on
guard
notices
what
is
going
on
the
drunkard
is
then
dragged
to
the
his
money
is
confiscated
if
he
has
any
left
and
he
is
flogged
the
convict
shakes
himself
like
a
beaten
dog
returns
to
barracks
and
after
a
few
days
resumes
his
trade
as
it
sometimes
happens
that
among
the
convicts
there
are
admirers
of
the
fair
sex
for
a
sufficiently
large
sum
of
money
they
succeed
accompanied
by
a
soldier
whom
they
have
corrupted
in
getting
secretly
out
of
the
fortress
into
a
suburb
instead
of
going
to
work
there
in
an
apparently
quiet
house
a
banquet
is
held
at
which
large
sums
of
money
are
spent
the
convicts
money
is
not
to
be
despised
accordingly
the
soldiers
will
sometimes
arrange
these
temporary
escapes
beforehand
sure
as
they
are
of
being
generously
recompensed
generally
speaking
these
soldiers
are
themselves
candidates
for
the
convict
prison
the
escapades
are
scarcely
ever
discovered
i
must
add
that
they
are
very
rare
for
they
are
very
expensive
and
the
admirers
of
the
fair
sex
are
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
other
less
costly
means
at
the
beginning
of
my
stay
a
young
convict
with
very
regular
features
excited
my
curiosity
his
name
was
sirotkin
he
was
in
many
respects
an
enigmatic
being
his
face
had
struck
me
he
was
not
more
than
years
of
age
and
he
belonged
to
the
special
section
that
is
to
say
he
was
condemned
to
hard
labour
in
perpetuity
he
accordingly
was
to
be
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
most
dangerous
of
military
criminals
mild
and
tranquil
he
spoke
little
and
rarely
laughed
his
blue
eyes
his
clear
complexion
his
fair
hair
gave
him
a
soft
expression
which
even
his
shaven
crown
did
not
destroy
although
he
had
no
trade
he
managed
to
get
himself
money
from
time
to
time
he
was
remarkably
lazy
and
always
dressed
like
a
sloven
but
if
any
one
was
generous
enough
to
present
him
with
a
red
shirt
he
was
beside
himself
with
joy
at
having
a
new
garment
and
he
exhibited
it
everywhere
sirotkin
neither
drank
nor
played
and
he
scarcely
ever
quarrelled
with
the
other
convicts
he
walked
about
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
peacefully
and
with
a
pensive
air
what
he
was
thinking
of
i
can
not
say
when
any
one
called
to
him
to
ask
him
a
question
he
replied
with
deference
precisely
without
chattering
like
the
others
he
had
in
his
eyes
the
expression
of
a
child
of
ten
when
he
had
money
he
bought
nothing
of
what
the
others
looked
upon
as
indispensable
his
vest
might
be
torn
he
did
not
get
it
mended
any
more
than
he
bought
himself
new
boots
what
particularly
pleased
him
were
the
little
white
rolls
and
gingerbread
which
he
would
eat
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
child
of
seven
when
he
was
not
at
work
he
wandered
about
the
barracks
when
every
one
else
was
occupied
he
remained
with
his
arms
by
his
sides
if
any
one
joked
with
him
or
laughed
at
him
which
happened
often
enough
he
turned
on
his
heel
without
speaking
and
went
elsewhere
if
the
pleasantry
was
too
strong
he
blushed
i
often
asked
myself
for
what
crime
he
could
have
been
condemned
to
hard
labour
one
day
when
i
was
ill
and
lying
in
the
hospital
sirotkin
was
also
there
stretched
out
on
a
bedstead
not
far
from
me
i
entered
into
conversation
with
him
he
became
animated
and
told
me
freely
how
he
had
been
taken
for
a
soldier
how
his
mother
had
followed
him
in
tears
and
what
treatment
he
had
endured
in
military
service
he
added
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
accustom
himself
to
this
life
every
one
was
severe
and
angry
with
him
about
nothing
his
officers
were
always
against
him
but
why
did
they
send
you
here
and
into
the
special
section
above
all
ah
sirotkin
yes
alexander
petrovitch
although
i
was
only
one
year
with
the
battalion
i
was
sent
here
for
killing
my
captain
gregory
petrovitch
i
heard
about
that
but
i
did
not
believe
it
how
was
it
that
you
killed
him
all
that
was
told
you
was
true
my
life
was
insupportable
but
the
other
recruits
supported
it
well
enough
it
is
very
hard
at
the
beginning
but
men
get
accustomed
to
it
and
end
by
becoming
excellent
soldiers
your
mother
must
have
pampered
you
and
spoiled
you
i
am
sure
that
she
fed
you
with
gingerbread
and
with
sweet
milk
until
you
were
eighteen
my
mother
it
is
true
was
very
fond
of
me
when
i
left
her
she
took
to
her
bed
and
remained
there
how
painful
to
me
everything
in
my
military
life
was
after
that
all
went
wrong
i
was
perpetually
being
punished
and
why
i
obeyed
every
one
i
was
exact
careful
i
did
not
drink
i
borrowed
from
no
one
it
all
up
with
a
man
when
he
begins
to
borrow
and
yet
every
one
around
me
was
harsh
and
cruel
i
sometimes
hid
myself
in
a
corner
and
did
nothing
but
sob
one
day
or
rather
one
night
i
was
on
guard
it
was
autumn
there
was
a
strong
wind
and
it
was
so
dark
that
you
could
not
see
a
speck
and
i
was
sad
so
sad
i
took
the
bayonet
from
the
end
of
my
musket
and
placed
it
by
my
side
then
i
put
the
barrel
to
my
breast
and
with
my
big
toe
i
had
taken
my
boot
off
pressed
the
trigger
it
missed
fire
i
looked
at
my
musket
and
loaded
it
with
a
charge
of
fresh
powder
then
i
broke
off
the
corner
of
my
flint
and
once
more
i
placed
the
muzzle
against
my
breast
again
there
was
a
misfire
what
was
i
to
do
i
said
to
myself
i
put
my
boot
on
i
fastened
my
bayonet
to
the
barrel
and
walked
up
and
down
with
my
musket
on
my
shoulder
let
them
do
what
they
like
i
said
to
myself
but
i
will
not
be
a
soldier
any
longer
afterwards
the
captain
arrived
making
his
rounds
he
came
straight
upon
me
that
the
way
you
carry
yourself
when
you
are
on
guard
i
seized
my
musket
and
stuck
the
bayonet
into
his
body
then
i
had
to
walk
versts
that
is
how
i
came
to
be
in
the
special
section
he
was
telling
no
falsehood
yet
i
did
not
understand
how
they
could
have
sent
him
there
such
crimes
deserve
a
much
less
severe
punishment
sirotkin
was
the
only
one
of
the
convicts
who
was
really
handsome
as
for
his
companions
of
the
special
section
to
the
number
of
fifteen
they
were
frightful
to
behold
with
their
hideous
disgusting
physiognomies
gray
heads
were
plentiful
among
them
i
shall
speak
of
these
men
further
on
sirotkin
was
often
on
good
terms
with
gazin
the
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
this
gazin
was
a
terrible
being
the
impression
that
he
produced
on
every
one
was
confusing
or
appalling
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
more
ferocious
a
more
monstrous
creature
could
not
exist
yet
i
have
seen
at
tobolsk
kameneff
the
brigand
celebrated
for
his
crimes
later
i
saw
sokoloff
the
escaped
convict
formerly
a
deserter
who
was
a
ferocious
creature
but
neither
of
them
inspired
me
with
so
much
disgust
as
gazin
i
often
fancied
that
i
had
before
my
eyes
an
enormous
gigantic
spider
of
the
size
of
a
man
he
was
a
tartar
and
there
was
no
convict
so
strong
as
he
was
it
was
less
by
his
great
height
and
his
herculean
construction
than
by
his
enormous
and
deformed
head
that
he
inspired
terror
the
strangest
reports
were
current
about
him
some
said
that
he
had
been
a
soldier
others
that
he
had
escaped
from
nertchinsk
and
that
he
had
been
exiled
several
times
to
siberia
but
had
always
succeeded
in
getting
away
landing
at
last
in
our
convict
prison
he
belonged
there
to
the
special
section
it
appeared
that
he
had
taken
a
pleasure
in
killing
little
children
when
he
had
attracted
them
to
some
deserted
place
then
he
frightened
them
tortured
them
and
after
having
fully
enjoyed
the
terror
and
the
convulsions
of
the
poor
little
things
he
killed
them
resolutely
and
with
delight
these
horrors
had
perhaps
been
imagined
by
reason
of
the
painful
impression
that
the
monster
produced
upon
us
but
they
seemed
probable
and
harmonised
with
his
physiognomy
nevertheless
when
gazin
was
not
drunk
he
conducted
himself
well
enough
he
was
always
quiet
never
quarrelled
avoided
all
disputes
as
if
from
contempt
for
his
companions
just
as
though
he
had
entertained
a
high
opinion
of
himself
he
spoke
very
little
all
his
movements
were
measured
calm
resolute
his
look
was
not
without
intelligence
but
its
expression
was
cruel
and
derisive
like
his
smile
of
all
the
convicts
who
sold
vodka
he
was
the
richest
twice
a
year
he
got
completely
drunk
and
it
was
then
that
all
his
brutal
ferocity
exhibited
itself
little
by
little
he
got
excited
and
began
to
tease
the
prisoners
with
venomous
satire
prepared
long
beforehand
finally
when
he
was
quite
drunk
he
had
attacks
of
furious
rage
and
seizing
a
knife
would
rush
upon
his
companions
the
convicts
who
knew
his
herculean
vigour
avoided
him
and
protected
themselves
against
him
for
he
would
throw
himself
on
the
first
person
he
met
a
means
of
disarming
him
had
been
discovered
some
dozen
prisoners
would
rush
suddenly
upon
gazin
and
give
him
violent
blows
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
in
the
belly
and
generally
beneath
the
region
of
the
heart
until
he
lost
consciousness
any
one
else
would
have
died
under
such
treatment
but
gazin
soon
got
well
when
he
had
been
well
beaten
they
would
wrap
him
up
in
his
pelisse
and
throw
him
upon
his
plank
bedstead
leaving
him
to
digest
his
drink
the
next
day
he
woke
up
almost
well
and
went
to
his
work
silent
and
sombre
every
time
that
gazin
got
drunk
all
the
prisoners
knew
how
his
day
would
finish
he
knew
also
but
he
drank
all
the
same
several
years
passed
in
this
way
then
it
was
noticed
that
gazin
had
lost
his
energy
and
that
he
was
beginning
to
get
weak
he
did
nothing
but
groan
complaining
of
all
kinds
of
illnesses
his
visits
to
the
hospital
became
more
and
more
frequent
he
is
giving
in
said
the
prisoners
at
one
time
gazin
had
gone
into
the
kitchen
followed
by
the
little
fellow
who
scraped
the
violin
and
whom
the
convicts
in
their
festivities
used
to
hire
to
play
to
them
he
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
silently
examining
his
companions
one
after
another
no
one
breathed
a
word
when
he
saw
me
with
my
companions
he
looked
at
us
in
his
malicious
jeering
style
and
smiled
horribly
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
satisfied
with
a
good
joke
that
he
had
just
thought
of
he
approached
our
table
tottering
might
i
ask
he
said
where
you
get
the
money
which
allows
you
to
drink
tea
i
exchanged
a
look
with
my
neighbour
i
understood
that
the
best
thing
for
us
was
to
be
silent
and
not
to
answer
the
least
contradiction
would
have
put
gazin
in
a
passion
you
must
have
money
he
continued
you
must
have
a
good
deal
of
money
to
drink
tea
but
tell
me
are
you
sent
to
hard
labour
to
drink
tea
i
say
did
you
come
here
for
that
purpose
please
answer
i
should
like
to
know
seeing
that
we
were
resolved
on
silence
and
that
we
had
determined
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
he
ran
towards
us
livid
and
trembling
with
rage
at
two
steps
distance
he
saw
a
heavy
box
which
served
to
hold
the
bread
given
for
the
dinner
and
supper
of
the
convicts
its
contents
were
sufficient
for
the
meal
of
half
the
prisoners
at
this
moment
it
was
empty
he
seized
it
with
both
hands
and
brandished
it
above
our
heads
although
murder
or
attempted
was
an
inexhaustible
source
of
trouble
for
the
convicts
examinations
and
inquiries
without
end
would
be
the
natural
consequence
and
though
quarrels
were
generally
cut
short
when
they
did
not
lead
to
such
serious
results
yet
every
one
remained
silent
and
waited
not
one
word
in
our
favour
not
one
cry
against
gazin
the
hatred
of
all
the
prisoners
for
all
who
were
of
gentle
birth
was
so
great
that
every
one
of
them
was
evidently
pleased
to
see
that
we
were
in
danger
but
a
fortunate
incident
terminated
this
scene
which
must
have
become
tragic
gazin
was
about
to
let
fly
the
enormous
box
which
he
was
turning
and
twisting
above
his
head
when
a
convict
ran
in
from
the
barracks
and
cried
out
gazin
they
have
stolen
your
vodka
the
horrible
brigand
let
fall
the
box
with
a
frightful
oath
and
ran
out
of
the
kitchen
well
god
has
saved
them
said
the
prisoners
among
themselves
repeating
the
words
several
times
i
never
knew
whether
his
vodka
had
been
stolen
or
whether
it
was
only
a
stratagem
invented
to
save
us
that
same
evening
before
the
closing
of
the
barracks
when
it
was
already
dark
i
walked
to
the
side
of
the
palisade
a
heavy
feeling
of
sadness
weighed
upon
my
soul
during
all
the
time
that
i
passed
in
the
convict
prison
i
never
felt
myself
so
miserable
as
on
that
evening
though
the
first
day
is
always
the
hardest
whether
at
hard
labour
or
in
the
prison
one
thought
in
particular
had
left
me
no
respite
since
my
deportation
a
question
insoluble
then
and
insoluble
now
i
reflected
on
the
inequality
of
the
punishments
inflicted
for
the
same
crimes
often
indeed
one
crime
can
not
be
compared
even
approximately
to
another
two
murderers
kill
a
man
under
circumstances
which
in
each
case
are
minutely
examined
and
weighed
they
each
receive
the
same
punishment
and
yet
by
what
an
abyss
are
their
two
actions
separated
one
has
committed
a
murder
for
a
trifle
for
an
onion
he
has
killed
on
the
a
peasant
who
was
passing
and
found
on
him
an
onion
and
nothing
else
well
i
was
sent
to
hard
labour
for
a
peasant
who
had
nothing
but
an
onion
fool
that
you
are
an
onion
is
worth
a
kopeck
if
you
had
killed
a
hundred
peasants
you
would
have
had
a
hundred
kopecks
or
one
rouble
the
above
is
a
prison
joke
another
criminal
has
killed
a
debauchee
who
was
oppressing
or
dishonouring
his
wife
his
sister
or
his
daughter
a
third
a
vagabond
half
dead
with
hunger
pursued
by
a
whole
band
of
police
was
defending
his
liberty
his
life
he
is
to
be
regarded
as
on
an
equality
with
the
brigand
who
assassinates
children
for
his
amusement
for
the
pleasure
of
feeling
their
warm
blood
flow
over
his
hands
of
seeing
them
shudder
in
a
last
palpitation
beneath
the
knife
which
tears
their
flesh
they
will
all
alike
be
sent
to
hard
labour
though
the
sentence
will
perhaps
not
be
for
the
same
number
of
years
but
the
variations
in
the
punishment
are
not
very
numerous
whereas
different
kinds
of
crimes
may
be
reckoned
by
thousands
as
many
characters
so
many
crimes
let
us
admit
that
it
is
impossible
to
get
rid
of
this
first
inequality
in
punishment
that
the
problem
is
insoluble
and
that
in
connection
with
penal
matters
it
is
the
squaring
of
the
circle
let
all
that
be
admitted
but
even
if
this
inequality
can
not
be
avoided
there
is
another
thing
to
be
thought
of
the
consequences
of
the
punishment
here
is
a
man
who
is
wasting
away
like
a
candle
there
is
another
one
on
the
contrary
who
had
no
idea
before
going
into
exile
that
there
could
be
such
a
gay
such
an
idle
life
where
he
would
find
a
circle
of
such
agreeable
friends
individuals
of
this
latter
class
are
to
be
found
in
the
convict
prison
now
take
a
man
of
heart
of
cultivated
mind
and
of
delicate
conscience
what
he
feels
kills
him
more
certainly
than
the
material
punishment
the
judgment
which
he
himself
pronounces
on
his
crime
is
more
pitiless
than
that
of
the
most
severe
tribunal
the
most
draconian
law
he
lives
by
the
side
of
another
convict
who
has
not
once
reflected
on
the
murder
he
is
expiating
during
the
whole
time
of
his
sojourn
in
the
convict
prison
he
perhaps
even
considers
himself
innocent
are
there
not
also
poor
devils
who
commit
crimes
in
order
to
be
sent
to
hard
labour
and
thus
to
escape
the
liberty
which
is
much
more
painful
than
confinement
a
man
life
is
miserable
he
has
never
perhaps
been
able
to
satisfy
his
hunger
he
is
worked
to
death
in
order
to
enrich
his
master
in
the
convict
prison
his
work
will
be
less
severe
less
crushing
he
will
eat
as
much
as
he
wants
better
than
he
could
ever
have
hoped
to
eat
had
he
remained
free
on
holidays
he
will
have
meat
and
fine
people
will
give
him
alms
and
his
evening
work
will
bring
him
in
some
money
and
the
society
one
meets
with
in
the
convict
prison
is
that
to
be
counted
for
nothing
the
convicts
are
clever
people
who
are
up
to
everything
the
new
arrival
can
scarcely
conceal
the
admiration
he
feels
for
his
companions
in
labour
he
has
seen
nothing
like
it
before
and
he
will
consider
himself
in
the
best
company
possible
is
it
possible
that
men
so
differently
situated
can
feel
in
an
equal
degree
the
punishment
inflicted
but
why
think
about
questions
that
are
insoluble
the
drum
beats
let
us
go
back
to
barracks
chapter
first
impressions
we
were
between
walls
once
more
the
doors
of
the
barracks
were
locked
each
with
a
particular
padlock
and
the
prisoners
remained
shut
up
till
the
next
morning
the
verification
was
made
by
a
officer
accompanied
by
two
soldiers
when
by
chance
an
officer
was
present
the
convicts
were
drawn
up
in
the
but
generally
speaking
they
were
identified
in
the
buildings
as
the
soldiers
often
made
mistakes
they
went
out
and
came
back
in
order
to
count
us
again
and
again
until
their
reckoning
was
satisfactory
then
the
barracks
were
closed
each
one
contained
about
thirty
prisoners
and
we
were
very
closely
packed
in
our
camp
bedsteads
as
it
was
too
soon
to
go
to
sleep
the
convicts
occupied
themselves
with
work
besides
the
old
soldier
of
whom
i
have
spoken
who
slept
in
our
dormitory
and
represented
there
the
administration
of
the
prison
there
was
in
our
barrack
another
old
soldier
wearing
a
medal
as
rewarded
for
good
conduct
it
happened
often
enough
however
that
the
men
themselves
committed
offences
for
which
they
were
sentenced
to
be
whipped
they
then
lost
their
rank
and
were
immediately
replaced
by
comrades
whose
conduct
was
considered
satisfactory
our
man
was
no
other
than
akim
akimitch
to
my
great
astonishment
he
was
very
rough
with
the
prisoners
but
they
only
replied
by
jokes
the
other
old
soldier
more
prudent
interfered
with
no
one
and
if
he
opened
his
mouth
it
was
only
as
a
matter
of
form
as
an
affair
of
duty
for
the
most
part
he
remained
silent
seated
on
his
little
bedstead
occupied
in
mending
his
own
boots
that
day
i
could
not
help
making
to
myself
an
observation
the
accuracy
of
which
became
afterwards
apparent
that
all
those
who
are
not
convicts
and
who
have
to
deal
with
them
whoever
they
may
be
beginning
with
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
and
the
sentinels
look
upon
the
convicts
in
a
false
and
exaggerated
light
expecting
that
for
a
yes
or
a
no
these
men
will
throw
themselves
upon
them
knife
in
hand
the
prisoners
perfectly
conscious
of
the
fear
they
inspire
show
a
certain
arrogance
accordingly
the
best
prison
director
is
the
one
who
experiences
no
emotion
in
their
presence
in
spite
of
the
airs
they
give
themselves
the
convicts
prefer
that
confidence
should
be
placed
in
them
by
such
means
indeed
they
may
be
conciliated
i
have
more
than
once
had
occasion
to
notice
their
astonishment
at
an
official
entering
their
prison
without
an
escort
and
certainly
their
astonishment
was
not
unflattering
a
visitor
who
is
intrepid
imposes
respect
if
anything
unfortunate
happens
it
will
not
be
in
his
presence
the
terror
inspired
by
the
convicts
is
general
and
yet
i
saw
no
foundation
for
it
is
it
the
appearance
of
the
prisoner
his
look
that
causes
a
certain
repugnance
is
it
not
rather
the
feeling
that
invades
you
directly
you
enter
the
prison
that
in
spite
of
all
efforts
all
precautions
it
is
impossible
to
turn
a
living
man
into
a
corpse
to
stifle
his
feelings
his
thirst
for
vengeance
and
for
life
his
passions
and
his
imperious
desire
to
satisfy
them
however
that
may
be
i
declare
that
there
is
no
reason
for
fearing
the
convicts
a
man
does
not
throw
himself
so
quickly
nor
so
easily
upon
his
knife
in
hand
few
accidents
happen
sometimes
they
are
so
rare
that
the
danger
may
be
looked
upon
as
i
speak
it
must
be
understood
only
of
prisoners
already
condemned
who
are
undergoing
their
punishment
and
some
of
whom
are
almost
happy
to
find
themselves
in
the
convict
prison
so
attractive
under
all
circumstances
is
a
new
form
of
life
these
latter
live
quiet
and
contented
as
for
the
turbulent
ones
the
convicts
themselves
keep
them
in
restraint
and
their
arrogance
never
goes
too
far
the
prisoner
audacious
and
reckless
as
he
may
be
is
afraid
of
every
official
connected
with
the
prison
it
is
by
no
means
the
same
with
the
accused
whose
fate
has
not
been
decided
such
a
one
is
quite
capable
of
attacking
no
matter
whom
without
any
motive
of
hatred
and
solely
because
he
is
to
be
whipped
the
next
day
if
indeed
he
commits
a
fresh
crime
his
offence
becomes
complicated
punishment
is
delayed
and
he
gains
time
the
act
of
aggression
is
explained
it
has
a
cause
an
object
the
convict
wishes
at
all
hazards
to
change
his
fate
and
that
as
soon
as
possible
in
connection
with
this
i
myself
have
witnessed
a
physiological
fact
of
the
strangest
kind
in
the
section
of
military
convicts
was
an
old
soldier
who
had
been
condemned
to
two
years
hard
labour
a
great
boaster
and
at
the
same
time
a
coward
generally
speaking
the
russian
soldier
does
not
boast
he
has
no
time
for
doing
so
even
had
he
the
inclination
when
such
a
one
appears
among
a
multitude
of
others
he
is
always
a
coward
and
a
rogue
dutoff
that
was
the
name
of
the
prisoner
of
whom
i
am
speaking
underwent
his
punishment
and
then
went
back
to
the
same
battalion
in
the
line
but
like
all
who
are
sent
to
the
convict
prison
to
be
corrected
he
had
been
thoroughly
corrupted
a
return
horse
in
the
convict
prison
after
two
or
three
weeks
liberty
not
for
a
comparatively
short
time
but
for
fifteen
or
twenty
years
so
it
happened
in
the
case
of
dutoff
three
weeks
after
he
had
been
set
at
liberty
he
robbed
one
of
his
comrades
and
was
moreover
mutinous
he
was
taken
before
a
and
sentenced
to
a
severe
form
of
corporal
punishment
horribly
frightened
like
the
coward
that
he
was
at
the
prospect
of
punishment
he
threw
himself
knife
in
hand
on
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
as
he
entered
his
dungeon
on
the
eve
of
the
day
that
he
was
to
run
the
gauntlet
through
the
men
of
his
company
he
quite
understood
that
he
was
aggravating
his
offence
and
that
the
duration
of
his
punishment
would
be
increased
but
all
he
wanted
was
to
postpone
for
some
days
or
at
least
for
some
hours
a
terrible
moment
he
was
such
a
coward
that
he
did
not
even
wound
the
officer
whom
he
had
attacked
he
had
indeed
only
committed
this
assault
in
order
to
add
a
new
crime
to
the
last
already
against
him
and
thus
defer
the
sentence
the
moment
preceding
the
punishment
is
terrible
for
the
man
condemned
to
the
rods
i
have
seen
many
of
them
on
the
eve
of
the
fatal
day
i
generally
met
with
them
in
the
hospital
when
i
was
ill
which
happened
often
enough
in
russia
the
people
who
show
most
compassion
for
the
convicts
are
certainly
the
doctors
who
never
make
between
the
prisoners
the
distinctions
observed
by
other
persons
brought
into
direct
relations
with
them
in
this
respect
the
common
people
can
alone
be
compared
with
the
doctors
for
they
never
reproach
a
criminal
with
the
crime
that
he
has
committed
whatever
it
may
be
they
forgive
him
in
consideration
of
the
sentence
passed
upon
him
is
it
not
known
that
the
common
people
throughout
russia
call
crime
a
misfortune
and
the
criminal
an
unfortunate
this
definition
is
expressive
profound
and
moreover
unconscious
instinctive
to
the
doctor
the
convicts
have
naturally
recourse
above
all
when
they
are
to
undergo
corporal
punishment
the
prisoner
who
has
been
before
a
knows
pretty
well
at
what
moment
his
sentence
will
be
executed
to
escape
it
he
gets
himself
sent
to
the
hospital
in
order
to
postpone
for
some
days
the
terrible
moment
when
he
is
declared
restored
to
health
he
knows
that
the
day
after
he
leaves
the
hospital
this
moment
will
arrive
accordingly
on
quitting
the
hospital
the
convict
is
always
in
a
state
of
agitation
some
of
them
may
endeavour
from
vanity
to
conceal
their
anxiety
but
no
one
is
taken
in
by
that
every
one
understands
the
cruelty
of
such
a
moment
and
is
silent
from
humane
motives
i
knew
one
young
convict
an
sentenced
for
murder
who
was
to
receive
the
maximum
of
rods
the
eve
of
the
day
on
which
he
was
to
be
flogged
he
had
resolved
to
drink
a
bottle
of
vodka
in
which
he
had
infused
a
quantity
of
snuff
the
prisoner
condemned
to
the
rods
always
drinks
before
the
critical
moment
arrives
a
certain
amount
of
spirits
which
he
has
procured
long
beforehand
and
often
at
a
fabulous
price
he
would
deprive
himself
of
the
necessaries
of
life
for
six
months
rather
than
not
be
in
a
position
to
swallow
half
a
pint
of
vodka
before
the
flogging
the
convicts
are
convinced
that
a
drunken
man
suffers
less
from
the
sticks
or
whip
than
one
who
is
in
cold
blood
i
will
return
to
my
narrative
the
poor
devil
felt
ill
a
few
moments
after
he
had
swallowed
his
bottle
of
vodka
he
vomited
blood
and
was
carried
in
a
state
of
unconsciousness
to
the
hospital
his
lungs
were
so
much
injured
by
this
accident
that
phthisis
declared
itself
and
carried
off
the
soldier
in
a
few
months
the
doctors
who
had
attended
him
never
knew
the
origin
of
his
illness
if
examples
of
cowardice
are
not
rare
among
the
prisoners
it
must
be
added
that
there
are
some
whose
intrepidity
is
quite
astounding
i
remember
many
instances
of
courage
pushed
to
the
extreme
the
arrival
in
the
hospital
of
a
terrible
bandit
remains
fixed
in
my
memory
one
fine
summer
day
the
report
was
spread
in
the
infirmary
that
the
famous
prisoner
orloff
was
to
be
flogged
the
same
evening
and
that
he
would
be
brought
afterwards
to
the
hospital
the
prisoners
who
were
already
there
said
that
the
punishment
would
be
a
cruel
one
and
every
one
including
myself
i
must
admit
was
awaiting
with
curiosity
the
arrival
of
this
brigand
about
whom
the
most
things
were
told
he
was
a
malefactor
of
a
rare
kind
capable
of
assassinating
in
cold
blood
old
men
and
children
he
possessed
an
indomitable
force
of
will
and
was
fully
conscious
of
his
power
as
he
had
been
guilty
of
several
crimes
they
had
condemned
him
to
be
flogged
through
the
ranks
he
was
brought
or
rather
carried
in
towards
evening
the
place
was
already
dark
candles
were
lighted
orloff
was
excessively
pale
almost
unconscious
with
his
thick
curly
hair
of
dull
black
without
the
least
brilliancy
his
back
was
skinned
and
swollen
blue
and
stained
with
blood
the
prisoners
nursed
him
throughout
the
night
they
changed
his
poultices
placed
him
on
his
side
prepared
for
him
the
lotion
ordered
by
the
doctor
in
a
word
showed
as
much
solicitude
for
him
as
for
a
relation
or
benefactor
next
day
he
had
fully
recovered
his
faculties
and
took
one
or
two
turns
round
the
room
i
was
much
astonished
for
he
was
broken
down
and
powerless
when
he
was
brought
in
he
had
received
half
the
number
of
blows
ordered
by
the
sentence
the
doctor
had
stopped
the
punishment
convinced
that
if
it
were
continued
orloff
death
would
inevitably
ensue
this
criminal
was
of
a
feeble
constitution
weakened
by
long
imprisonment
whoever
has
seen
prisoners
after
having
been
flogged
will
remember
their
thin
features
and
their
feverish
looks
orloff
soon
recovered
his
powerful
energy
which
enabled
him
to
get
over
his
physical
weakness
he
was
no
ordinary
man
from
curiosity
i
made
his
acquaintance
and
was
able
to
study
him
at
leisure
for
an
entire
week
never
in
my
life
did
i
meet
a
man
whose
will
was
more
firm
or
inflexible
i
had
seen
at
tobolsk
a
celebrity
of
the
same
kind
a
former
chief
of
brigands
this
man
was
a
veritable
wild
beast
by
being
near
him
without
even
knowing
him
it
was
impossible
not
to
recognise
in
him
a
dangerous
creature
what
above
all
frightened
me
was
his
stupidity
matter
in
this
man
had
taken
such
an
ascendant
over
mind
that
one
could
see
at
a
glance
that
he
cared
for
nothing
in
the
world
but
the
brutal
satisfaction
of
his
physical
wants
i
was
certain
however
that
kareneff
that
was
his
name
would
have
fainted
on
being
condemned
to
such
rigorous
corporal
punishment
as
orloff
had
undergone
and
that
he
would
have
murdered
the
first
man
near
him
without
blinking
orloff
on
the
contrary
was
a
brilliant
example
of
the
victory
of
spirit
over
matter
he
had
a
perfect
command
over
himself
he
despised
punishment
and
feared
nothing
in
the
world
his
dominant
characteristic
was
boundless
energy
a
thirst
for
vengeance
and
an
immovable
will
when
he
had
some
object
to
attain
i
was
not
astonished
at
his
haughty
air
he
looked
down
upon
all
around
him
from
the
height
of
his
grandeur
not
that
he
took
the
trouble
to
pose
his
pride
was
an
innate
quality
i
do
think
that
anything
had
the
least
influence
over
him
he
looked
upon
everything
with
the
calmest
eye
as
if
nothing
in
the
world
could
astonish
him
he
knew
well
that
the
other
prisoners
respected
him
but
he
never
took
advantage
of
it
to
give
himself
airs
nevertheless
vanity
and
conceit
are
defects
from
which
scarcely
any
convict
is
exempt
he
was
intelligent
and
strangely
frank
in
talking
too
much
about
himself
he
replied
to
all
the
questions
i
put
to
him
and
confessed
to
me
that
he
was
waiting
impatiently
for
his
return
to
health
in
order
to
take
the
remainder
of
the
punishment
he
was
to
undergo
now
he
said
to
me
with
a
wink
it
is
all
over
i
shall
have
the
remainder
and
shall
be
sent
to
nertchinsk
with
a
convoy
of
prisoners
i
shall
profit
by
it
to
escape
i
shall
get
away
beyond
doubt
if
only
my
back
would
heal
a
little
quicker
for
five
days
he
was
burning
with
impatience
to
be
in
a
condition
for
leaving
the
hospital
at
times
he
was
gay
and
in
the
best
of
humours
i
profited
by
these
rare
occasions
to
question
him
about
his
adventures
then
he
would
contract
his
eyebrows
a
little
but
he
always
answered
my
questions
in
a
straightforward
manner
when
he
understood
that
i
was
endeavouring
to
see
through
him
and
to
discover
in
him
some
trace
of
repentance
he
looked
at
me
with
a
haughty
and
contemptuous
air
as
if
i
were
a
foolish
little
boy
to
whom
he
did
too
much
honour
by
conversing
with
him
i
detected
in
his
countenance
a
sort
of
compassion
for
me
after
a
moment
pause
he
laughed
out
loud
but
without
the
least
irony
i
fancy
he
must
more
than
once
have
laughed
in
the
same
manner
when
my
words
returned
to
his
memory
at
last
he
wrote
down
his
name
as
cured
although
his
back
was
not
yet
entirely
healed
as
i
also
was
almost
well
we
left
the
infirmary
together
and
returned
to
the
convict
prison
while
he
was
shut
up
in
the
where
he
had
been
imprisoned
before
when
he
left
me
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
which
in
his
eyes
was
a
great
mark
of
confidence
i
fancy
he
did
so
because
at
that
moment
he
was
in
a
good
humour
but
in
reality
he
must
have
despised
me
for
i
was
a
feeble
being
contemptible
in
all
respects
and
guilty
above
all
of
resignation
the
next
day
he
underwent
the
second
half
of
his
punishment
when
the
gates
of
the
barracks
had
been
closed
it
assumed
in
less
than
no
time
quite
another
aspect
that
of
a
private
house
of
quite
a
home
then
only
did
i
see
my
convict
comrades
at
their
ease
during
the
day
the
under
officers
or
some
of
the
other
authorities
might
suddenly
arrive
so
that
the
prisoners
were
then
always
on
the
they
were
only
half
at
their
ease
as
soon
however
as
the
bolts
had
been
pushed
and
the
gates
padlocked
every
one
sat
down
in
his
place
and
began
to
work
the
barrack
was
lighted
up
in
an
unexpected
manner
each
convict
had
his
candle
and
his
wooden
candlestick
some
of
them
stitched
boots
others
sewed
different
kinds
of
garments
the
air
already
mephitic
became
more
and
more
impure
some
of
the
prisoners
huddled
together
in
a
corner
played
at
cards
on
a
piece
of
carpet
in
each
barrack
there
was
a
prisoner
who
possessed
a
small
piece
of
carpet
a
candle
and
a
pack
of
horribly
greasy
cards
the
owner
of
the
cards
received
from
the
players
fifteen
kopecks
about
sixpence
a
night
they
generally
played
at
the
three
leaves
gorka
that
is
to
say
a
game
of
chance
each
player
placed
before
him
a
pile
of
copper
money
all
that
he
possessed
and
did
not
get
up
until
he
had
lost
it
or
had
broken
the
bank
playing
was
continued
until
late
at
night
sometimes
the
dawn
found
the
gamblers
still
at
their
game
often
indeed
it
did
not
cease
until
a
few
minutes
before
the
opening
of
the
gates
in
our
room
as
in
all
the
others
there
were
beggars
ruined
by
drink
and
play
or
rather
beggars
innate
i
say
innate
and
maintain
my
expression
indeed
in
our
country
and
in
all
classes
there
are
and
always
will
be
strange
people
whose
destiny
it
is
to
remain
always
beggars
they
are
poor
devils
all
their
lives
quite
broken
down
they
remain
under
the
domination
or
guardianship
of
some
one
generally
a
prodigal
or
a
man
who
has
suddenly
made
his
fortune
all
initiative
is
for
them
an
insupportable
burden
they
only
exist
on
condition
of
undertaking
nothing
for
themselves
and
by
serving
always
living
under
the
will
of
another
they
are
destined
to
act
by
and
through
others
under
no
circumstances
even
of
the
most
unexpected
kind
can
they
get
rich
they
are
always
beggars
i
have
met
these
persons
in
all
classes
of
society
in
all
coteries
in
all
associations
including
the
literary
world
as
soon
as
a
party
was
made
up
one
of
these
beggars
quite
indispensable
to
the
game
was
summoned
he
received
five
kopecks
for
a
whole
night
employment
and
what
employment
it
was
his
duty
was
to
keep
guard
in
the
vestibule
with
thirty
degrees
réaumur
of
frost
in
total
darkness
for
six
or
seven
hours
the
man
on
watch
had
to
listen
for
the
slightest
noise
for
the
major
or
one
of
the
other
officers
of
the
guard
would
sometimes
make
a
round
rather
late
in
the
night
they
arrived
secretly
and
sometimes
discovered
the
players
and
the
watchers
in
the
act
thanks
to
the
light
of
the
candles
which
could
be
seen
from
the
when
the
key
was
heard
grinding
in
the
padlock
which
closed
the
gate
it
was
too
late
to
put
the
lights
out
and
lie
down
on
the
plank
bedsteads
such
surprises
were
however
rare
five
kopecks
was
a
ridiculous
payment
even
in
our
convict
prison
and
the
exigency
and
hardness
of
the
gamblers
astonished
me
in
this
as
in
many
cases
you
are
paid
you
must
do
what
you
are
told
this
was
the
argument
and
it
admitted
of
no
reply
to
have
paid
a
few
kopecks
to
any
one
gave
the
right
to
turn
him
to
the
best
possible
account
and
even
to
claim
his
gratitude
more
than
once
it
happened
to
me
to
see
the
convicts
spend
their
money
extravagantly
throwing
it
away
on
all
sides
and
at
the
same
time
cheat
the
man
employed
to
watch
i
have
seen
this
in
several
barracks
on
many
occasions
i
have
already
said
that
with
the
exception
of
the
gamblers
every
one
worked
five
only
of
the
convicts
remained
completely
idle
and
went
to
bed
on
the
first
opportunity
my
sleeping
place
was
near
the
door
next
to
me
was
akim
akimitch
and
when
we
were
lying
down
our
heads
touched
he
used
to
work
until
ten
or
eleven
at
making
by
pasting
together
pieces
of
paper
multicolour
lanterns
which
some
one
living
in
the
town
had
ordered
from
him
and
for
which
he
used
to
be
well
paid
he
excelled
in
this
kind
of
work
and
did
it
methodically
and
regularly
when
he
had
finished
he
put
away
carefully
his
tools
unfolded
his
mattress
said
his
prayers
and
went
to
sleep
with
the
sleep
of
the
just
he
carried
his
love
of
order
even
to
pedantry
and
must
have
thought
himself
in
his
inner
heart
a
man
of
brains
as
is
generally
the
case
with
narrow
mediocre
persons
i
did
not
like
him
the
first
day
although
he
gave
me
much
to
think
of
i
was
astonished
that
such
a
man
could
be
found
in
a
convict
prison
i
shall
speak
of
akimitch
further
on
in
the
course
of
this
book
but
i
must
now
continue
to
describe
the
persons
with
whom
i
was
to
live
a
number
of
years
those
who
surrounded
me
were
to
be
my
companions
every
minute
and
it
will
be
understood
that
i
looked
upon
them
with
anxious
curiosity
on
my
left
slept
a
band
of
mountaineers
from
the
caucasus
nearly
all
exiled
for
brigandage
but
condemned
to
different
punishments
there
were
two
lesghians
a
circassian
and
three
tartars
from
daghestan
the
circassian
was
a
morose
and
sombre
person
he
scarcely
ever
spoke
and
looked
at
you
sideways
with
a
sly
sulky
expression
one
of
the
lesghians
an
old
man
with
an
aquiline
nose
tall
and
thin
seemed
to
be
a
true
brigand
but
the
other
lesghian
nourra
by
name
made
a
most
favourable
impression
upon
me
of
middle
height
still
young
built
like
a
hercules
with
fair
hair
and
violet
eyes
he
had
a
slightly
turned
up
nose
while
his
features
were
somewhat
of
a
finnish
cast
like
all
horsemen
he
walked
with
his
toes
in
his
body
was
striped
with
scars
ploughed
by
bayonet
wounds
and
bullets
although
he
belonged
to
the
conquered
part
of
the
caucasus
he
had
joined
the
rebels
with
whom
he
used
to
make
continual
incursions
into
our
territory
every
one
liked
him
in
the
prison
by
reason
of
his
gaiety
and
affability
he
worked
without
murmuring
always
calm
and
peaceful
thieving
cheating
and
drunkenness
filled
him
with
disgust
or
put
him
in
a
rage
not
that
he
wished
to
quarrel
with
any
one
he
simply
turned
away
with
indignation
during
his
confinement
he
committed
no
breach
of
the
rules
fervently
pious
he
said
his
prayers
religiously
every
evening
observed
all
the
mohammedan
fasts
like
a
true
fanatic
and
passed
whole
nights
in
prayer
every
one
liked
him
and
looked
upon
him
as
a
thoroughly
honest
man
nourra
is
a
lion
said
the
convicts
and
the
name
of
lion
stuck
to
him
he
was
quite
convinced
that
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
sentence
he
would
be
sent
to
the
caucasus
indeed
he
only
lived
by
this
hope
and
i
believe
he
would
have
died
had
he
been
deprived
of
it
i
noticed
it
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
how
was
it
possible
not
to
distinguish
this
calm
honest
face
in
the
midst
of
so
many
sombre
sardonic
repulsive
countenances
before
i
had
been
in
the
prison
he
passed
by
my
side
and
touched
me
gently
on
the
shoulder
smiling
at
the
same
time
with
an
innocent
air
i
did
not
at
first
understand
what
he
meant
for
he
spoke
russian
very
badly
but
soon
afterwards
he
passed
again
and
with
a
friendly
smile
again
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
for
three
days
running
he
repeated
this
strange
proceeding
as
i
soon
found
out
he
wanted
to
show
me
that
he
pitied
me
and
that
he
felt
how
painful
the
first
moment
of
imprisonment
must
be
he
wanted
to
testify
his
sympathy
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
to
assure
me
of
his
kind
and
innocent
nourra
of
the
three
tartars
from
daghestan
all
brothers
the
two
eldest
were
men
while
the
youngest
ali
was
not
more
than
and
looked
younger
he
slept
by
my
side
and
when
i
observed
his
frank
intelligent
countenance
thoroughly
natural
i
was
at
once
attracted
to
him
and
thanked
my
fate
that
i
had
him
for
a
neighbour
in
place
of
some
other
prisoner
his
whole
soul
could
be
read
in
his
beaming
countenance
his
confident
smile
had
a
certain
childish
simplicity
his
large
black
eyes
expressed
such
friendliness
such
tender
feeling
that
i
always
took
a
pleasure
in
looking
at
him
it
was
a
relief
to
me
in
moments
of
sadness
and
anguish
one
day
his
eldest
brother
he
had
five
of
whom
two
were
working
in
the
mines
of
siberia
had
ordered
him
to
take
his
yataghan
to
get
on
horseback
and
follow
him
the
respect
of
the
mountaineers
for
their
elders
is
so
great
that
young
ali
did
not
dare
to
ask
the
object
of
the
expedition
he
probably
knew
nothing
about
it
nor
did
his
brothers
consider
it
necessary
to
tell
him
they
were
going
to
plunder
the
caravan
of
a
rich
armenian
merchant
and
they
succeeded
in
their
enterprise
they
assassinated
the
merchant
and
stole
his
goods
unhappily
for
them
their
act
of
brigandage
was
discovered
they
were
tried
flogged
and
then
sent
to
hard
labour
in
siberia
the
court
admitted
no
extenuating
circumstances
except
in
the
case
of
ali
he
was
condemned
to
the
minimum
punishment
four
years
confinement
these
brothers
loved
him
their
affection
being
paternal
rather
than
fraternal
he
was
the
only
consolation
of
their
exile
dull
and
sad
as
a
rule
they
had
always
a
smile
for
him
when
they
spoke
to
him
which
they
rarely
did
for
they
looked
upon
him
as
a
child
to
whom
it
would
be
useless
to
speak
seriously
their
forbidding
countenances
lightened
up
i
fancied
they
always
spoke
to
him
in
a
jocular
tone
as
to
an
infant
when
he
replied
the
brothers
exchanged
glances
and
smiled
he
would
not
have
dared
to
speak
to
them
first
by
reason
of
his
respect
for
them
how
this
young
man
preserved
his
tender
heart
his
native
honesty
his
frank
cordiality
without
getting
perverted
and
corrupted
during
his
period
of
hard
labour
is
quite
inexplicable
in
spite
of
his
gentleness
he
had
a
strong
stoical
nature
as
i
afterwards
saw
chaste
as
a
young
girl
everything
that
was
foul
cynical
shameful
or
unjust
filled
his
fine
black
eyes
with
indignation
and
made
them
finer
than
ever
without
being
a
coward
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
he
avoided
quarrels
and
insults
and
preserved
all
his
dignity
with
whom
indeed
was
he
to
quarrel
every
one
loved
him
caressed
him
at
first
he
was
only
polite
to
me
but
little
by
little
we
got
into
the
habit
of
talking
together
in
the
evening
and
in
a
few
months
he
had
learnt
to
speak
russian
perfectly
whereas
his
brothers
never
gained
a
correct
knowledge
of
the
language
he
was
intelligent
and
at
the
same
time
modest
and
full
of
delicate
feeling
ali
was
an
exceptional
being
and
i
always
think
of
my
meeting
him
as
one
of
the
lucky
things
in
my
life
there
are
some
natures
so
spontaneously
good
and
endowed
by
god
with
such
great
qualities
that
the
idea
of
their
getting
perverted
seems
absurd
one
is
always
at
ease
about
them
accordingly
i
had
never
any
fears
about
ali
where
is
he
now
one
day
a
considerable
time
after
my
arrival
at
the
convict
prison
i
was
stretched
out
on
my
agitated
by
painful
thoughts
ali
always
industrious
was
not
working
at
this
moment
his
time
for
going
to
bed
had
not
arrived
the
brothers
were
celebrating
some
mussulman
festival
and
were
not
working
ali
was
lying
down
with
his
head
between
his
hands
in
a
state
of
reverie
suddenly
he
said
to
me
well
you
are
very
sad
i
looked
at
him
with
curiosity
such
a
remark
from
ali
always
so
delicate
so
full
of
tact
seemed
strange
but
i
looked
at
him
more
attentively
and
saw
so
much
grief
so
much
repressed
suffering
in
his
countenance
of
suffering
caused
no
doubt
by
sudden
recollections
that
i
understood
in
what
pain
he
must
be
and
said
so
to
him
he
uttered
a
deep
sigh
and
smiled
with
a
melancholy
air
i
always
liked
his
graceful
agreeable
smile
when
he
laughed
he
showed
two
rows
of
teeth
which
the
first
beauty
in
the
world
would
have
envied
him
you
were
probably
thinking
ali
how
this
festival
is
celebrated
in
daghestan
ah
you
were
happy
there
yes
he
replied
with
enthusiasm
and
his
eyes
sparkled
how
did
you
know
i
was
thinking
of
such
things
how
was
i
not
to
know
you
were
much
better
off
than
you
are
here
why
do
you
say
that
what
beautiful
flowers
there
are
in
your
country
is
it
not
so
it
is
a
true
paradise
be
silent
please
he
was
much
agitated
listen
ali
had
you
a
sister
yes
why
do
you
ask
me
she
must
have
been
very
beautiful
if
she
is
like
you
oh
there
is
no
comparison
to
make
between
us
in
all
daghestan
no
such
beautiful
girl
is
to
be
seen
my
sister
is
indeed
charming
i
am
sure
that
you
have
never
seen
any
one
like
her
my
mother
also
is
very
handsome
and
your
mother
was
fond
of
you
what
are
you
saying
certainly
she
was
i
am
sure
that
she
has
died
of
grief
she
was
so
fond
of
me
i
was
her
favourite
child
yes
she
loved
me
more
than
my
sister
more
than
all
the
others
this
very
night
she
has
appeared
to
me
in
a
dream
she
shed
tears
for
me
he
was
silent
and
throughout
the
rest
of
the
night
did
not
open
his
mouth
but
from
this
very
moment
he
sought
my
company
and
my
conversation
although
very
respectful
he
never
allowed
himself
to
address
me
first
on
the
other
hand
he
was
happy
when
i
entered
into
conversation
with
him
he
spoke
often
of
the
caucasus
and
of
his
past
life
his
brothers
did
not
forbid
him
to
converse
with
me
i
think
even
that
they
encouraged
him
to
do
so
when
they
saw
that
i
had
formed
an
attachment
to
him
they
became
more
affable
towards
me
ali
often
helped
me
in
my
work
in
the
barrack
he
did
whatever
he
thought
would
be
agreeable
to
me
and
would
save
me
trouble
in
his
attentions
to
me
there
was
neither
servility
nor
the
hope
of
any
advantage
but
only
a
warm
cordial
feeling
which
he
did
not
try
to
hide
he
had
an
extraordinary
aptitude
for
the
mechanical
arts
he
had
learnt
to
sew
very
tolerably
and
to
mend
boots
he
even
understood
a
little
carpentering
everything
in
short
that
could
be
learnt
at
the
convict
prison
his
brothers
were
proud
of
him
listen
ali
i
said
to
him
one
day
why
do
you
learn
to
read
and
write
the
russian
language
it
might
be
very
useful
to
you
here
in
siberia
i
should
like
to
do
so
but
who
would
teach
me
there
are
plenty
of
people
here
who
can
read
and
write
i
myself
will
teach
you
if
you
like
oh
do
teach
me
i
beg
of
you
said
ali
raising
himself
up
in
bed
he
joined
his
hands
and
looked
at
me
with
a
suppliant
air
we
went
to
work
the
very
next
evening
i
had
with
me
a
russian
translation
of
the
new
testament
the
only
book
that
was
not
forbidden
in
the
prison
with
this
book
alone
without
an
alphabet
ali
learnt
to
read
in
a
few
weeks
and
after
a
few
months
he
could
read
perfectly
he
brought
to
his
studies
extraordinary
zeal
and
warmth
one
day
we
were
reading
together
the
sermon
on
the
mount
i
noticed
that
he
read
certain
passages
with
much
feeling
and
i
asked
him
if
he
was
pleased
with
what
he
read
he
glanced
at
me
and
his
face
suddenly
lighted
up
yes
yes
jesus
is
a
holy
prophet
he
speaks
the
language
of
god
how
beautiful
it
is
but
tell
me
what
it
is
that
particularly
pleases
you
the
passage
in
which
it
is
said
those
that
hate
you
ah
how
divinely
he
speaks
he
turned
towards
his
brothers
who
were
listening
to
our
conversation
and
said
to
them
with
warmth
a
few
words
they
talked
together
seriously
for
some
time
giving
their
approval
of
what
their
young
brother
had
said
by
a
nodding
of
the
head
then
with
a
grave
kindly
smile
quite
a
mussulman
smile
i
liked
the
gravity
of
this
smile
they
assured
me
that
isu
jesus
was
a
great
prophet
he
had
done
great
miracles
he
had
created
a
bird
with
a
little
clay
on
which
he
breathed
the
breath
of
life
and
the
bird
had
then
flown
away
that
they
said
was
written
in
their
books
they
were
convinced
that
they
would
please
me
much
by
praising
jesus
as
for
ali
he
was
happy
to
see
that
his
brothers
approved
of
our
friendship
and
that
they
were
giving
me
what
he
thought
would
be
grateful
words
the
success
i
had
with
my
pupil
in
teaching
him
to
write
was
really
extraordinary
ali
had
bought
paper
at
his
own
expense
for
he
would
not
allow
me
to
purchase
any
also
pens
and
ink
and
in
less
than
two
months
he
had
learnt
to
write
his
brothers
were
astonished
at
such
rapid
progress
their
satisfaction
and
their
pride
were
without
bounds
they
did
not
know
how
to
show
me
enough
gratitude
at
the
workshop
if
we
happened
to
be
together
there
were
disputes
as
to
which
of
them
should
help
me
i
do
not
speak
of
ali
he
felt
for
me
more
affection
than
even
for
his
brothers
i
shall
never
forget
the
day
on
which
he
was
liberated
he
went
with
me
outside
the
barracks
threw
himself
on
my
neck
and
sobbed
he
had
never
embraced
me
before
and
had
never
before
wept
in
my
presence
you
have
done
so
much
for
me
he
said
neither
my
father
nor
my
mother
have
ever
been
kinder
you
have
made
a
man
of
me
god
will
bless
you
i
shall
never
forget
you
never
where
is
he
now
where
is
my
good
kind
dear
ali
besides
the
circassians
we
had
a
certain
number
of
poles
who
formed
a
separate
group
they
had
scarcely
any
relations
with
the
other
convicts
i
have
already
said
that
thanks
to
their
hatred
for
the
russian
prisoners
they
were
detested
by
every
one
they
were
of
a
restless
morbid
disposition
there
were
six
of
them
some
of
them
men
of
education
of
whom
i
shall
speak
in
detail
further
on
it
was
from
them
that
during
the
last
days
of
my
imprisonment
i
obtained
a
few
books
the
first
work
i
read
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
i
shall
speak
further
on
of
these
sensations
which
i
look
upon
as
very
curious
though
it
will
be
difficult
to
understand
them
of
this
i
am
certain
for
there
are
certain
things
as
to
which
one
can
not
judge
without
having
experienced
them
oneself
it
will
be
enough
for
me
to
say
that
intellectual
privations
are
more
difficult
to
support
than
the
most
frightful
physical
tortures
a
common
man
sent
to
hard
labour
finds
himself
in
kindred
society
perhaps
even
in
a
more
interesting
society
than
he
has
been
accustomed
to
he
loses
his
native
place
his
family
but
his
ordinary
surroundings
are
much
the
same
as
before
a
man
of
education
condemned
by
law
to
the
same
punishment
as
the
common
man
suffers
incomparably
more
he
must
stifle
all
his
needs
all
his
habits
he
must
descend
into
a
lower
sphere
must
breathe
another
air
he
is
like
a
fish
thrown
upon
the
sand
the
punishment
that
he
undergoes
equal
for
all
criminals
according
to
the
law
is
ten
times
more
severe
and
more
painful
for
him
than
for
the
common
man
this
is
an
incontestable
truth
even
if
one
thinks
only
of
the
material
habits
that
have
to
be
sacrificed
i
was
saying
that
the
poles
formed
a
group
by
themselves
they
lived
together
and
of
all
the
convicts
in
the
prison
they
cared
only
for
a
jew
and
for
no
other
reason
than
because
he
amused
them
our
jew
was
generally
liked
although
every
one
laughed
at
him
we
only
had
one
and
even
now
i
can
not
think
of
him
without
laughing
whenever
i
looked
at
him
i
thought
of
the
jew
jankel
whom
gogol
describes
in
his
tarass
boulba
and
who
when
undressed
and
ready
to
go
to
bed
with
his
jewess
in
a
sort
of
cupboard
resembled
a
fowl
but
isaiah
fomitch
bumstein
and
a
plucked
fowl
were
as
like
one
another
as
two
drops
of
water
he
was
already
of
a
certain
age
about
fifty
small
feeble
cunning
and
at
the
same
time
very
stupid
bold
and
boastful
though
a
horrible
coward
his
face
was
covered
with
wrinkles
his
forehead
and
cheeks
were
scarred
from
the
burning
he
had
received
in
the
pillory
i
never
understood
how
he
had
been
able
to
support
the
sixty
strokes
he
received
he
had
been
sentenced
for
murder
he
carried
on
his
person
a
medical
prescription
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
other
jews
immediately
after
his
exposure
in
the
pillory
thanks
to
the
ointment
prescribed
the
scars
were
to
disappear
in
less
than
a
fortnight
he
had
been
afraid
to
use
it
he
was
waiting
for
the
expiration
of
his
twenty
years
after
which
he
would
become
a
colonist
in
order
to
utilise
his
famous
remedy
otherwise
i
shall
not
be
able
to
get
married
he
would
say
and
i
must
absolutely
marry
we
were
great
friends
his
was
inexhaustible
the
life
of
the
convict
prison
did
not
seem
to
disagree
with
him
a
goldsmith
by
trade
he
received
more
orders
than
he
could
execute
for
there
was
no
jeweller
shop
in
our
town
he
thus
escaped
his
hard
labour
as
a
matter
of
course
he
lent
money
on
pledges
to
the
convicts
who
paid
him
heavy
interest
he
arrived
at
the
prison
before
i
did
one
of
the
poles
related
to
me
his
triumphal
entry
it
is
quite
a
history
which
i
shall
relate
further
on
for
i
shall
often
have
to
speak
of
isaiah
fomitch
bumstein
as
for
the
other
prisoners
there
were
first
of
all
four
old
believers
among
whom
was
the
old
man
from
starodoub
two
or
three
little
russians
very
morose
persons
and
a
young
convict
with
delicate
features
and
a
nose
about
years
of
age
who
had
already
committed
eight
murders
besides
a
band
of
coiners
one
of
whom
was
the
buffoon
of
our
barracks
and
finally
some
sombre
convicts
shorn
and
disfigured
always
silent
and
full
of
envy
they
looked
askance
at
all
who
came
near
them
and
must
have
continued
to
do
so
during
a
long
course
of
years
i
saw
all
this
superficially
on
the
first
night
of
my
arrival
in
the
midst
of
thick
smoke
in
a
mephitic
atmosphere
amid
obscene
oaths
accompanied
by
the
rattling
of
chains
by
insults
and
cynical
laughter
i
stretched
myself
out
on
the
bare
planks
my
head
resting
on
my
coat
rolled
up
to
do
duty
in
lieu
of
a
pillow
not
yet
supplied
to
me
then
i
covered
myself
with
my
sheepskin
but
thanks
to
the
painful
impression
of
this
evening
i
was
unable
for
some
time
to
get
to
sleep
my
new
life
was
only
just
beginning
the
future
reserved
for
me
many
things
which
i
had
not
foreseen
and
of
which
i
had
never
the
least
idea
chapter
vi
the
first
month
three
days
after
my
arrival
i
was
ordered
to
go
to
work
the
impression
left
upon
me
to
this
day
is
still
very
clear
although
there
was
nothing
very
striking
in
it
unless
one
considers
that
my
position
was
in
itself
extraordinary
the
first
sensations
count
for
a
good
deal
and
i
as
yet
looked
upon
everything
with
curiosity
my
first
three
days
were
certainly
the
most
painful
of
all
my
terms
of
imprisonment
my
wandering
is
at
an
end
i
said
to
myself
every
moment
i
am
now
in
the
convict
prison
my
for
many
years
here
is
where
i
am
to
live
i
come
here
full
of
grief
who
knows
that
when
i
leave
it
i
shall
not
do
so
with
regret
i
said
this
to
myself
as
one
touches
a
wound
the
better
to
feel
its
pain
the
idea
that
i
might
regret
my
stay
was
terrible
to
me
already
i
felt
to
what
an
intolerable
degree
man
is
a
creature
of
habit
but
this
was
a
matter
of
the
future
the
present
meanwhile
was
terrible
enough
the
wild
curiosity
with
which
my
convict
companions
examined
me
their
harshness
towards
a
former
nobleman
now
entering
into
their
corporation
a
harshness
which
sometimes
took
the
form
of
hatred
all
this
tormented
me
to
such
a
degree
that
i
felt
obliged
of
my
own
accord
to
go
to
work
in
order
to
measure
at
one
stroke
the
whole
extent
of
my
misfortune
that
i
might
at
once
begin
to
live
like
the
others
and
fall
with
them
into
the
same
abyss
but
convicts
differ
and
i
had
not
yet
disentangled
from
the
general
hostility
the
sympathy
here
and
there
manifested
towards
me
after
a
time
the
affability
and
shown
to
me
by
certain
convicts
gave
me
a
little
courage
and
restored
my
spirits
most
friendly
among
them
was
akim
akimitch
i
soon
noticed
some
kind
faces
in
the
dark
and
hateful
crowd
bad
people
are
to
be
found
everywhere
but
even
among
the
worst
there
may
be
something
good
i
began
to
think
by
way
of
consolation
who
knows
these
persons
are
perhaps
not
worse
than
others
who
are
free
while
making
these
reflections
i
felt
some
doubts
and
nevertheless
how
much
i
was
in
the
right
the
convict
suchiloff
for
example
a
man
whose
acquaintance
i
did
not
make
until
long
afterwards
although
he
was
near
me
during
nearly
the
whole
period
of
my
confinement
whenever
i
speak
of
the
convicts
who
are
not
worse
than
other
men
my
thoughts
turn
involuntarily
to
him
he
acted
as
my
servant
together
with
another
prisoner
named
osip
whom
akim
akimitch
had
recommended
to
me
immediately
after
my
arrival
for
thirty
kopecks
a
month
this
man
agreed
to
cook
me
a
separate
dinner
in
case
i
should
not
be
able
to
put
up
with
the
ordinary
prison
fare
and
should
be
able
to
pay
for
my
own
food
osip
was
one
of
the
four
cooks
chosen
by
the
prisoners
in
our
two
kitchens
i
may
observe
that
they
were
at
liberty
to
refuse
these
duties
and
give
them
up
whenever
they
might
think
fit
the
cooks
were
men
from
whom
hard
labour
was
not
expected
they
had
to
bake
bread
and
prepare
the
cabbage
soup
they
were
called
not
from
contempt
for
the
men
chosen
were
always
the
most
intelligent
but
merely
in
fun
the
name
given
to
them
did
not
annoy
them
for
many
years
past
osip
had
been
constantly
selected
as
he
never
refused
the
duty
except
when
he
was
out
of
sorts
or
when
he
saw
an
opportunity
of
getting
spirits
into
the
barracks
although
he
had
been
sent
to
the
convict
prison
as
a
smuggler
he
was
remarkably
honest
and
i
have
spoken
of
him
before
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
dreadful
coward
and
feared
the
rod
above
all
things
of
a
peaceful
patient
disposition
affable
with
everybody
he
never
got
into
quarrels
but
he
could
never
resist
the
temptation
of
bringing
spirits
in
notwithstanding
his
cowardice
and
simply
from
his
love
of
smuggling
like
all
the
other
cooks
he
dealt
in
spirits
but
on
a
much
less
extensive
scale
than
gazin
because
he
was
afraid
of
running
the
same
risks
i
always
lived
on
good
terms
with
osip
to
have
a
separate
table
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
very
rich
it
cost
me
only
one
rouble
a
month
apart
from
the
bread
which
was
given
to
us
sometimes
when
i
was
very
hungry
i
made
up
my
mind
to
eat
the
cabbage
soup
in
spite
of
the
disgust
with
which
it
generally
filled
me
after
a
time
this
disgust
entirely
disappeared
i
generally
bought
one
pound
of
meat
a
day
which
cost
me
two
kopecks
kopecks
pence
the
old
soldiers
who
watched
over
the
internal
discipline
of
the
barracks
were
ready
to
go
every
day
to
the
market
to
make
purchases
for
the
convicts
for
this
they
received
no
pay
except
from
time
to
time
a
trifling
present
they
did
it
for
the
sake
of
their
peace
their
life
in
the
convict
prison
would
have
been
a
perpetual
torment
had
they
refused
they
used
to
bring
in
tobacco
tea
meat
everything
in
short
that
was
desired
always
excepting
spirits
for
many
years
osip
prepared
for
me
every
day
a
piece
of
roast
meat
how
he
managed
to
get
it
cooked
was
a
secret
what
was
strangest
in
the
matter
was
that
during
all
this
time
i
scarcely
exchanged
two
words
with
him
i
tried
many
times
to
make
him
talk
but
he
was
incapable
of
keeping
up
a
conversation
he
would
only
smile
and
answer
my
questions
by
yes
or
no
he
was
a
hercules
but
he
had
no
more
intelligence
than
a
child
of
seven
suchiloff
was
also
one
of
those
who
helped
me
i
had
never
asked
him
to
do
so
he
attached
himself
to
me
on
his
own
account
and
i
scarcely
remember
when
he
began
to
do
so
his
principal
duty
consisted
in
washing
my
linen
for
this
purpose
there
was
a
basin
in
the
middle
of
the
round
which
the
convicts
washed
their
clothes
in
prison
buckets
suchiloff
had
found
means
for
rendering
me
a
number
of
little
services
he
boiled
my
ran
right
and
left
to
perform
various
commissions
for
me
got
me
all
kinds
of
things
mended
my
clothes
and
greased
my
boots
four
times
a
month
he
did
all
this
in
a
zealous
manner
with
a
air
as
if
he
felt
all
the
weight
of
the
duties
he
was
performing
he
seemed
quite
to
have
joined
his
fate
to
mine
and
occupied
himself
with
all
my
affairs
he
never
said
you
have
so
many
shirts
or
your
waistcoat
is
torn
but
we
have
so
many
shirts
and
our
waistcoat
is
torn
i
had
somehow
inspired
him
with
admiration
and
i
really
believe
that
i
had
become
his
sole
care
in
life
as
he
knew
no
trade
whatever
his
only
source
of
income
was
from
me
and
it
must
be
understood
that
i
paid
him
very
little
but
he
was
always
pleased
whatever
he
might
receive
he
would
have
been
without
means
had
he
not
been
a
servant
of
mine
and
he
gave
me
the
preference
because
i
was
more
affable
than
the
others
and
above
all
more
equitable
in
money
matters
he
was
one
of
those
beings
who
never
get
rich
and
never
know
how
to
manage
their
affairs
one
of
those
in
the
prison
who
were
hired
by
the
gamblers
to
watch
all
night
in
the
listening
for
the
least
noise
that
might
announce
the
arrival
of
the
major
if
there
was
a
night
visit
they
received
nothing
indeed
their
back
paid
for
their
want
of
attention
one
thing
which
marks
this
kind
of
men
is
their
entire
absence
of
individuality
which
they
seem
entirely
to
have
lost
suchiloff
was
a
poor
meek
fellow
all
the
courage
seemed
to
have
been
beaten
out
of
him
although
he
had
in
reality
been
born
meek
for
nothing
in
the
world
would
he
have
raised
his
hand
against
any
one
in
the
prison
i
always
pitied
him
without
knowing
why
i
could
not
look
at
him
without
feeling
the
deepest
compassion
for
him
if
asked
to
explain
this
i
should
find
it
impossible
to
do
so
i
could
never
get
him
to
talk
and
he
never
became
animated
except
when
to
put
an
end
to
all
attempts
at
conversation
i
gave
him
something
to
do
or
told
him
to
go
somewhere
for
me
i
soon
found
that
he
loved
to
be
ordered
about
neither
tall
nor
short
neither
ugly
nor
handsome
neither
stupid
nor
intelligent
neither
old
nor
young
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
in
any
definite
manner
this
man
except
that
his
face
was
slightly
pitted
with
the
and
that
he
had
fair
hair
he
belonged
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
to
the
same
company
as
sirotkin
the
prisoners
sometimes
laughed
at
him
because
he
had
exchanged
during
the
march
to
siberia
he
had
exchanged
for
a
red
shirt
and
a
silver
rouble
it
was
thought
comical
that
he
should
have
sold
himself
for
such
a
small
sum
to
take
the
name
of
another
prisoner
in
place
of
his
own
and
consequently
to
accept
the
other
sentence
strange
as
it
may
appear
it
was
nevertheless
true
this
custom
which
had
become
traditional
and
still
existed
at
the
time
i
was
sent
to
siberia
i
at
first
refused
to
believe
but
found
afterwards
that
it
really
existed
this
is
how
the
exchange
was
effected
a
company
of
prisoners
started
for
siberia
among
them
there
are
exiles
of
all
kinds
some
condemned
to
hard
labour
others
to
labour
in
the
mines
others
to
simple
colonisation
on
the
way
out
no
matter
at
what
stage
of
the
journey
in
the
government
of
perm
for
instance
a
prisoner
wishes
to
exchange
with
another
man
who
we
will
say
he
is
named
mikhailoff
has
been
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
a
capital
offence
and
does
not
like
the
prospect
of
passing
long
years
without
his
liberty
he
knows
in
his
cunning
what
to
do
he
looks
among
his
comrades
for
some
simple
fellow
whose
punishment
is
less
severe
who
has
been
condemned
to
a
few
years
in
the
mines
or
to
hard
labour
or
has
perhaps
been
simply
exiled
at
last
he
finds
such
a
man
as
suchiloff
a
former
serf
sentenced
only
to
become
a
colonist
the
man
has
made
fifteen
hundred
versts
about
one
thousand
miles
without
a
kopeck
for
the
good
reason
that
a
suchiloff
is
always
without
money
fatigued
exhausted
he
can
get
nothing
to
eat
beyond
the
fixed
rations
nothing
to
wear
in
addition
to
the
convict
uniform
mikhailoff
gets
into
conversation
with
suchiloff
they
suit
one
another
and
they
strike
up
a
friendship
at
last
at
some
station
mikhailoff
makes
his
comrade
drunk
then
he
will
ask
him
if
he
will
exchange
my
name
is
mikhailoff
he
says
to
him
condemned
to
what
is
called
hard
labour
but
which
in
my
own
case
will
be
nothing
of
the
kind
as
i
am
to
enter
a
particular
special
section
i
am
classed
with
the
men
but
in
my
special
division
the
labour
is
not
so
severe
before
the
special
section
was
abolished
many
persons
in
the
official
world
even
at
petersburg
were
unaware
even
of
its
existence
it
was
in
such
a
retired
corner
of
one
of
the
most
distant
regions
of
siberia
that
it
was
difficult
to
know
anything
about
it
it
was
insignificant
moreover
from
the
number
of
persons
belonging
to
it
in
my
time
they
numbered
altogether
only
seventy
i
have
since
met
men
who
have
served
in
siberia
and
know
the
country
well
and
yet
have
never
heard
of
the
special
section
in
the
rules
and
regulations
there
are
only
six
lines
about
this
institution
attached
to
the
convict
prison
of
is
a
special
section
reserved
for
the
most
dangerous
criminals
while
the
severest
labours
are
being
prepared
for
them
the
prisoners
themselves
knew
nothing
of
this
special
section
did
it
exist
temporarily
or
constantly
neither
suchiloff
nor
any
of
the
prisoners
being
sent
out
not
mikhailoff
himself
could
guess
the
significance
of
those
two
words
mikhailoff
however
had
his
suspicion
as
to
the
true
character
of
this
section
he
formed
his
opinion
from
the
gravity
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
made
to
march
three
or
four
thousand
versts
on
foot
it
was
certain
that
he
was
not
being
sent
to
a
place
where
he
would
be
at
his
ease
suchiloff
was
to
be
a
colonist
what
could
mikhailoff
desire
better
than
that
wo
you
change
he
asks
suchiloff
is
a
little
drunk
he
is
a
man
full
of
gratitude
to
the
comrade
who
entertains
him
and
dare
not
refuse
he
has
heard
moreover
from
other
prisoners
that
these
exchanges
are
made
and
understands
therefore
that
there
is
nothing
extraordinary
in
the
proposition
made
to
him
an
agreement
is
come
to
the
cunning
mikhailoff
profiting
by
simplicity
buys
his
name
for
a
red
shirt
and
a
silver
rouble
which
are
given
before
witnesses
the
next
day
suchiloff
is
sober
but
more
liquor
is
given
to
him
then
he
drinks
up
his
own
rouble
and
after
a
while
the
red
shirt
has
the
same
fate
if
you
do
like
the
bargain
we
made
give
me
back
my
money
says
mikhailoff
but
where
is
suchiloff
to
get
a
rouble
if
he
does
not
give
it
back
the
artel
the
association
in
this
case
of
convicts
will
force
him
to
keep
his
promise
the
prisoners
are
very
sensitive
on
such
points
he
must
keep
his
promise
the
artel
requires
it
and
in
case
of
disobedience
woe
to
the
offender
he
will
be
killed
or
at
least
seriously
intimidated
if
indeed
the
artel
once
showed
mercy
to
the
men
who
had
broken
their
word
there
would
be
an
end
to
its
existence
if
the
given
word
can
be
recalled
and
the
bargain
put
an
end
to
after
the
stipulated
sum
has
been
paid
who
would
be
bound
by
such
an
agreement
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
for
the
artel
accordingly
the
prisoners
are
very
severe
on
the
point
suchiloff
then
finds
that
it
is
impossible
to
go
back
that
nothing
can
save
him
and
he
accordingly
agrees
to
all
that
is
demanded
of
him
the
bargain
is
then
made
known
to
all
the
convoy
and
if
denunciations
are
feared
the
men
looked
upon
as
suspicious
are
entertained
what
moreover
does
it
matter
to
the
others
whether
mikhailoff
or
suchiloff
goes
to
the
devil
they
have
had
gratuitous
drinks
they
have
been
feasted
for
nothing
and
the
secret
is
kept
by
all
at
the
next
station
the
names
are
called
when
mikhailoff
turn
arrives
suchiloff
answers
present
mikhailoff
replies
present
for
suchiloff
and
the
journey
is
continued
the
matter
is
not
now
even
talked
about
at
tobolsk
the
prisoners
are
told
off
mikhailoff
will
become
a
colonist
while
suchiloff
is
sent
to
the
special
section
under
a
double
escort
it
would
be
useless
now
to
cry
out
to
protest
for
what
proof
could
be
given
how
many
years
would
it
take
to
decide
the
affair
what
benefit
would
the
complainant
derive
where
moreover
are
the
witnesses
they
would
deny
everything
even
if
they
could
be
found
that
is
how
suchiloff
for
a
silver
rouble
and
a
red
shirt
came
to
be
sent
to
the
special
section
the
prisoners
laughed
at
him
not
because
he
had
exchanged
though
in
general
they
despised
those
who
had
been
foolish
enough
to
exchange
a
work
that
was
easy
for
a
work
that
was
hard
but
simply
because
he
had
received
nothing
for
the
bargain
except
a
red
shirt
and
a
rouble
certainly
a
ridiculous
compensation
generally
speaking
the
exchanges
are
made
for
relatively
large
sums
several
notes
sometimes
change
hands
but
suchiloff
was
so
characterless
so
insignificant
so
null
that
he
could
scarcely
even
be
laughed
at
we
lived
a
considerable
time
together
he
and
i
i
had
got
accustomed
to
him
and
he
had
formed
an
attachment
for
me
one
day
however
i
can
never
forgive
myself
for
what
i
did
he
had
not
executed
my
orders
and
when
he
came
to
ask
me
for
his
money
i
had
the
cruelty
to
say
to
him
you
do
forget
to
ask
for
your
money
but
you
do
do
what
you
are
told
suchiloff
remained
silent
and
hastened
to
do
as
he
was
ordered
but
he
suddenly
became
very
sad
two
days
passed
i
could
not
believe
that
what
i
had
said
to
him
could
affect
him
so
much
i
knew
that
a
person
named
vassilieff
was
claiming
from
him
in
a
morose
manner
payment
of
a
small
debt
suchiloff
was
probably
short
of
money
and
did
not
dare
to
ask
me
for
any
suchiloff
you
wish
i
think
to
ask
me
for
some
money
to
pay
vassilieff
take
this
i
was
seated
on
my
suchiloff
remained
standing
up
before
me
much
astonished
that
i
myself
should
propose
to
give
him
money
and
that
i
remembered
his
difficult
position
the
more
so
as
latterly
he
had
asked
me
several
times
for
money
in
advance
and
could
scarcely
hope
that
i
should
give
him
any
more
he
looked
at
the
paper
i
held
out
to
him
then
looked
at
me
turned
sharply
on
his
heel
and
went
out
i
was
as
astonished
as
i
could
be
i
went
out
after
him
and
found
him
at
the
back
of
the
barracks
he
was
standing
up
with
his
face
against
the
palisade
and
his
arms
resting
on
the
stakes
what
is
the
matter
suchiloff
i
asked
him
he
made
no
reply
and
to
my
stupefaction
i
saw
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
you
think
alexander
petrovitch
he
said
in
a
trembling
voice
in
endeavouring
not
to
look
at
me
that
i
care
only
for
your
money
but
i
he
turned
away
from
me
and
struck
the
palisade
with
his
forehead
and
began
to
sob
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
convict
prison
that
i
had
seen
a
man
weep
i
had
much
trouble
in
consoling
him
and
he
afterwards
served
me
if
possible
with
more
zeal
than
ever
he
watched
for
my
orders
but
by
almost
imperceptible
indications
i
could
see
that
his
heart
would
never
forgive
me
for
my
reproach
meanwhile
other
men
laughed
at
him
and
teased
him
whenever
the
opportunity
presented
itself
and
even
insulted
him
without
his
losing
his
temper
on
the
contrary
he
still
remained
on
good
terms
with
them
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
know
a
man
even
after
having
lived
long
years
with
him
the
convict
prison
had
not
at
first
for
me
the
significance
it
was
afterwards
to
assume
i
was
at
first
in
spite
of
my
attention
unable
to
understand
many
facts
which
were
staring
me
in
the
face
i
was
naturally
first
struck
by
the
most
salient
points
but
i
saw
them
from
a
false
point
of
view
and
the
only
impression
they
made
upon
me
was
one
of
unmitigated
sadness
what
contributed
above
all
to
this
result
was
my
meeting
with
a
f
the
convict
who
had
come
to
the
prison
before
me
and
who
had
astonished
me
in
such
a
painful
manner
during
the
first
few
days
the
effect
of
his
baseness
was
to
aggravate
my
moral
suffering
already
sufficiently
cruel
he
offered
the
most
repulsive
example
of
the
kind
of
degradation
and
baseness
to
which
a
man
may
fall
when
all
feeling
of
honour
has
perished
within
him
this
young
man
of
noble
birth
i
have
spoken
of
him
before
used
to
repeat
to
the
major
all
that
was
done
in
the
barracks
and
in
doing
so
through
the
fedka
here
is
the
man
history
arrived
at
petersburg
before
he
had
finished
his
studies
after
a
quarrel
with
his
parents
whom
his
life
of
debauchery
had
terrified
he
had
not
shrunk
for
the
sake
of
money
from
doing
the
work
of
an
informer
he
did
not
hesitate
to
sell
the
blood
of
ten
men
in
order
to
satisfy
his
insatiable
thirst
for
the
grossest
and
most
licentious
pleasures
at
last
he
became
so
completely
perverted
in
the
petersburg
taverns
and
houses
of
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
take
part
in
an
affair
which
he
knew
to
be
conceived
in
madness
for
he
was
not
without
intelligence
he
was
condemned
to
exile
and
ten
years
hard
labour
in
siberia
one
might
have
thought
that
such
a
frightful
blow
would
have
shocked
him
that
it
would
have
caused
some
reaction
and
brought
about
a
crisis
but
he
accepted
his
new
fate
without
the
least
confusion
it
did
not
frighten
him
all
that
he
feared
in
it
was
the
necessity
of
working
and
of
giving
up
for
ever
his
habits
of
debauchery
the
name
of
convict
had
no
effect
but
to
prepare
him
for
new
acts
of
baseness
and
more
hideous
villainies
than
any
he
had
previously
perpetrated
i
am
now
a
convict
and
can
crawl
at
ease
without
shame
that
was
the
light
in
which
he
looked
upon
his
new
position
i
think
of
this
disgusting
creature
as
of
some
monstrous
phenomenon
during
the
many
years
i
have
lived
in
the
midst
of
murderers
debauchees
and
proved
rascals
never
in
my
life
did
i
meet
a
case
of
such
complete
moral
abasement
determined
corruption
and
shameless
baseness
among
us
there
was
a
parricide
of
noble
birth
i
have
already
spoken
of
him
but
i
could
see
by
several
signs
that
he
was
much
better
and
more
humane
than
a
during
the
whole
time
of
my
punishment
he
was
never
anything
more
in
my
eyes
than
a
piece
of
flesh
furnished
with
teeth
and
a
stomach
greedy
for
the
most
offensive
and
ferocious
animal
enjoyments
for
the
satisfaction
of
which
he
was
ready
to
assassinate
anyone
i
do
not
exaggerate
in
the
least
i
recognised
in
a
f
one
of
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
animality
restrained
by
no
principles
no
rule
how
much
i
was
disgusted
by
his
eternal
smile
he
was
a
monster
a
moral
quasimodo
he
was
at
the
same
time
intelligent
cunning
had
received
some
education
and
possessed
a
certain
capacity
fire
plague
famine
no
matter
what
scourge
is
preferable
to
the
presence
of
such
a
man
in
human
society
i
have
already
said
that
in
the
convict
prison
espionage
and
denunciation
flourished
as
the
natural
product
of
degradation
without
the
convicts
thinking
much
of
it
on
the
contrary
they
maintained
friendly
relations
with
a
they
were
more
affable
with
him
than
with
any
one
else
the
kindly
attitude
towards
him
of
our
drunken
friend
the
major
gave
him
a
certain
importance
and
even
a
certain
worth
in
the
eyes
of
the
convicts
later
on
this
cowardly
wretch
ran
away
with
another
convict
and
the
soldier
in
charge
of
them
but
of
this
i
shall
speak
in
proper
time
and
place
at
first
he
hung
about
me
thinking
i
did
not
know
his
history
i
repeat
that
he
poisoned
the
first
days
of
my
imprisonment
so
as
to
drive
me
nearly
to
despair
i
was
terrified
by
the
mass
of
baseness
and
cowardice
in
the
midst
of
which
i
had
been
thrown
i
imagined
that
every
one
else
was
as
foul
and
cowardly
as
he
but
i
made
a
mistake
in
supposing
that
every
one
resembled
a
during
the
first
three
days
i
did
nothing
but
wander
about
the
convict
prison
when
i
did
not
remain
stretched
out
on
my
i
entrusted
to
a
prisoner
of
whom
i
was
sure
the
piece
of
linen
which
had
been
delivered
to
me
by
the
administration
in
order
that
he
might
make
me
some
shirts
always
on
the
advice
of
akim
akimitch
i
got
myself
a
folding
mattress
it
was
in
felt
covered
with
linen
as
thin
as
a
pancake
and
very
hard
to
any
one
who
was
not
accustomed
to
it
akim
akimitch
promised
to
get
me
all
the
most
essential
things
and
with
his
own
hands
made
me
a
blanket
out
of
a
piece
of
old
cloth
cut
and
sewn
together
from
all
the
old
trousers
and
waistcoats
which
i
had
bought
from
various
prisoners
the
clothes
delivered
to
them
when
they
have
been
worn
the
regulation
time
become
the
property
of
the
prisoners
they
at
once
sell
them
for
however
much
worn
an
article
of
clothing
may
be
it
always
possesses
a
certain
value
i
was
very
much
astonished
by
all
this
above
all
at
the
outset
during
my
first
relations
with
this
world
i
became
as
low
as
my
companions
as
much
a
convict
as
they
their
customs
their
habits
their
ideas
influenced
me
thoroughly
and
externally
became
my
own
without
affecting
my
inner
self
i
was
astonished
and
confused
as
though
i
had
never
heard
or
suspected
anything
of
the
kind
before
and
yet
i
knew
what
to
expect
or
at
least
what
had
been
told
me
the
thing
itself
however
produced
on
me
a
different
impression
from
the
mere
description
of
it
how
could
i
suppose
for
instance
that
old
rags
possessed
still
some
value
and
nevertheless
my
blanket
was
made
up
entirely
of
tatters
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
the
cloth
out
of
which
the
clothes
of
the
convicts
were
made
it
was
like
the
thick
gray
cloth
manufactured
for
the
soldiers
but
as
soon
as
it
had
been
worn
some
little
time
it
showed
the
threads
and
tore
with
abominable
ease
the
uniform
ought
to
have
lasted
for
a
whole
year
but
it
never
went
so
long
as
that
the
prisoner
labours
carries
heavy
burdens
and
the
cloth
naturally
wears
out
and
gets
into
holes
very
quickly
our
sheepskins
were
intended
to
be
worn
for
three
years
during
the
whole
of
that
time
they
served
as
outer
garments
blankets
and
pillows
but
they
were
very
solid
nevertheless
at
the
end
of
the
third
year
it
was
not
rare
to
see
them
mended
with
ordinary
linen
although
they
were
now
very
much
worn
it
was
always
possible
to
sell
them
at
the
rate
of
forty
kopecks
a
piece
the
best
preserved
ones
even
at
the
price
of
sixty
kopecks
which
was
a
great
sum
for
the
convict
prison
money
as
i
have
before
said
has
a
sovereign
value
in
such
a
place
it
is
certain
that
a
prisoner
who
has
some
pecuniary
resources
suffers
ten
times
less
than
the
one
who
has
nothing
when
the
government
supplies
all
the
wants
of
the
convict
what
need
can
he
have
for
money
reasoned
our
chief
nevertheless
i
repeat
that
if
the
prisoners
had
been
deprived
of
the
opportunity
of
possessing
something
of
their
own
they
would
have
lost
their
reason
or
would
have
died
like
flies
they
would
have
committed
crimes
some
from
wearisomeness
or
grief
the
others
in
order
to
get
sooner
punished
and
according
to
their
expression
have
a
change
if
the
convict
who
has
gained
some
kopecks
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
who
has
embarked
in
perilous
undertakings
in
order
to
conquer
them
if
he
spends
this
money
recklessly
with
childish
stupidity
that
does
not
the
least
in
the
world
prove
that
he
does
not
know
its
value
as
might
at
first
sight
be
thought
the
convict
is
greedy
for
money
to
the
point
of
losing
his
reason
and
if
he
throws
it
away
he
does
so
in
order
to
procure
what
he
places
far
above
money
liberty
or
at
least
a
semblance
of
liberty
convicts
are
great
dreamers
i
will
speak
of
that
further
on
with
more
detail
at
present
i
will
confine
myself
to
saying
that
i
have
heard
men
who
had
been
condemned
to
twenty
years
hard
labour
say
with
a
quiet
air
when
i
have
finished
my
time
if
god
wishes
then
the
very
words
hard
labour
or
forced
labour
indicate
that
the
man
has
lost
his
freedom
and
when
this
man
spends
his
money
he
is
carrying
out
his
own
will
in
spite
of
the
branding
and
the
chains
in
spite
of
the
palisade
which
hides
from
his
eyes
the
free
world
and
encloses
him
in
a
cage
like
a
wild
beast
he
can
get
himself
spirits
and
other
delights
sometimes
even
not
always
corrupt
his
immediate
superintendents
the
old
soldiers
and
officers
and
get
them
to
close
their
eyes
to
his
infractions
of
discipline
within
the
prison
he
can
moreover
what
he
adores
swagger
that
is
to
say
impress
his
companions
and
persuade
himself
for
a
time
that
he
enjoys
more
liberty
than
he
really
possesses
the
poor
devil
wishes
in
a
word
to
convince
himself
of
what
he
knows
to
be
impossible
this
is
why
the
prisoners
take
such
pleasure
in
boasting
and
exaggerating
in
burlesque
fashion
their
own
unhappy
personality
finally
they
run
some
risk
when
they
give
themselves
up
to
this
boasting
in
which
again
they
find
a
semblance
of
life
and
liberty
the
only
thing
they
care
for
would
not
a
millionaire
with
a
rope
round
his
neck
give
all
his
millions
for
one
breath
of
air
a
prisoner
has
lived
quietly
for
several
years
in
succession
his
conduct
has
been
so
exemplary
that
he
has
been
rewarded
by
special
exemptions
suddenly
to
the
great
astonishment
of
his
chiefs
this
man
becomes
mutinous
plays
the
very
devil
and
does
not
recoil
from
a
capital
crime
such
as
assassination
violation
etc
every
one
is
astounded
at
the
cause
of
this
unexpected
explosion
on
the
part
of
a
man
thought
incapable
of
such
a
thing
it
is
the
convulsive
manifestation
of
his
personality
an
instinctive
melancholia
an
uncontrollable
desire
for
all
of
which
obscures
his
reason
it
is
a
sort
of
epileptic
attack
a
spasm
a
man
buried
alive
who
suddenly
wakes
up
must
strike
in
a
similar
manner
against
the
lid
of
his
coffin
he
tries
to
rise
up
to
push
it
from
him
although
his
reason
must
convince
him
of
the
uselessness
of
his
efforts
reason
however
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
convulsion
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
almost
every
voluntary
manifestation
on
the
part
of
a
convict
is
looked
upon
as
a
crime
accordingly
it
is
a
perfect
matter
of
indifference
to
them
whether
this
manifestation
be
important
or
insignificant
debauch
for
debauch
danger
for
danger
it
is
just
as
well
to
go
to
the
end
even
as
far
as
a
murder
the
only
difficulty
is
the
first
step
little
by
little
the
man
becomes
excited
intoxicated
and
can
no
longer
contain
himself
for
that
reason
it
would
be
better
not
to
drive
him
to
extremities
everybody
would
be
much
better
for
it
but
how
can
this
be
managed
chapter
vii
the
first
month
when
i
entered
the
convict
prison
i
possessed
a
small
sum
of
money
but
i
carried
very
little
of
it
about
with
me
lest
it
should
be
confiscated
i
had
gummed
some
banknotes
into
the
binding
of
my
new
testament
the
only
book
authorised
in
the
convict
prison
this
new
testament
had
been
given
to
me
at
tobolsk
by
a
person
who
had
been
exiled
some
dozens
of
years
and
who
had
got
accustomed
to
see
in
other
unfortunates
a
brother
there
are
in
siberia
people
who
pass
their
lives
in
giving
brotherly
assistance
to
the
unfortunates
they
feel
the
same
sympathy
for
them
that
they
would
have
for
their
own
children
their
compassion
is
something
sacred
and
quite
disinterested
i
can
not
help
here
relating
in
some
words
a
meeting
which
i
had
at
this
time
in
the
town
where
we
were
then
imprisoned
lived
a
widow
nastasia
ivanovna
naturally
none
of
us
were
in
direct
relations
with
this
woman
she
had
made
it
the
object
of
her
life
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
all
the
exiles
but
above
all
of
us
convicts
had
there
been
some
misfortune
in
her
family
had
some
person
dear
to
her
undergone
a
punishment
similar
to
ours
i
do
not
know
in
any
case
she
did
for
us
whatever
she
could
it
is
true
she
could
do
very
little
for
she
was
very
poor
but
we
felt
when
we
were
shut
up
in
the
convict
prison
that
outside
we
had
a
devoted
friend
she
often
brought
us
news
which
we
were
very
glad
to
hear
for
nothing
of
the
kind
reached
us
when
i
left
the
prison
to
be
taken
to
another
town
i
had
the
opportunity
of
calling
upon
her
and
making
her
acquaintance
she
lived
in
one
of
the
suburbs
at
the
house
of
a
near
relation
nastasia
ivanovna
was
neither
old
nor
young
neither
pretty
nor
ugly
it
was
difficult
impossible
even
to
know
whether
she
was
intelligent
and
but
in
her
actions
could
be
seen
infinite
compassion
an
irresistible
desire
to
please
to
solace
to
be
in
some
way
agreeable
all
this
could
be
read
in
the
sweetness
of
her
smile
i
passed
an
entire
evening
at
her
house
with
other
companions
of
my
imprisonment
she
looked
us
straight
in
the
face
laughed
when
we
laughed
did
everything
we
asked
her
in
conversation
was
always
of
our
opinion
and
did
her
best
in
every
way
to
entertain
us
she
gave
us
tea
and
various
little
delicacies
if
she
had
been
rich
we
felt
sure
she
would
have
been
pleased
if
only
to
be
able
to
entertain
us
better
and
offer
for
us
some
solid
consolation
when
we
wished
her
she
gave
us
each
a
present
of
a
cardboard
as
a
souvenir
she
had
made
them
herself
heaven
knows
how
with
coloured
paper
the
paper
with
which
are
covered
all
round
this
cardboard
she
had
gummed
by
way
of
ornamentation
a
thin
edge
of
gilt
paper
as
you
smoke
these
will
perhaps
be
of
use
to
you
she
said
as
if
excusing
herself
for
making
such
a
present
there
are
people
who
say
as
i
have
read
and
heard
that
a
great
love
for
one
neighbour
is
only
a
form
of
selfishness
what
selfishness
could
there
be
in
this
that
i
could
never
understand
although
i
had
not
much
money
when
i
entered
the
convict
prison
i
could
not
nevertheless
feel
seriously
annoyed
with
convicts
who
immediately
on
my
arrival
after
having
deceived
me
once
came
to
borrow
of
me
a
second
a
third
time
and
even
oftener
but
i
admitted
frankly
that
what
did
annoy
me
was
the
thought
that
all
these
people
with
their
smiling
knavery
must
take
me
for
a
fool
and
laugh
at
me
just
because
i
lent
the
money
for
the
fifth
time
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
that
i
was
the
dupe
of
their
tricks
and
their
deceit
if
on
the
contrary
i
had
refused
them
and
sent
them
away
i
am
certain
that
they
would
have
had
much
more
respect
for
me
still
though
it
vexed
me
very
much
i
could
not
refuse
them
i
was
rather
anxious
during
the
first
days
to
know
what
footing
i
should
hold
in
the
convict
prison
and
what
rule
of
conduct
i
should
follow
with
my
companions
i
felt
and
perfectly
understood
that
the
place
being
in
every
way
new
to
me
i
was
walking
in
darkness
and
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
live
for
ten
years
in
darkness
i
decided
to
act
frankly
according
to
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
and
my
personal
feeling
but
i
also
knew
that
this
decision
might
be
very
well
in
theory
and
that
i
should
in
practice
be
governed
by
unforeseen
events
accordingly
in
addition
to
all
the
petty
annoyances
caused
to
me
by
my
confinement
in
the
convict
prison
one
terrible
anguish
laid
hold
of
me
and
tormented
me
more
and
more
the
i
said
to
myself
when
night
fell
and
i
looked
from
the
threshold
of
our
barracks
at
the
prisoners
just
returned
from
their
labours
and
walking
about
in
the
from
the
kitchen
to
the
barracks
and
as
i
examined
their
movements
and
their
physiognomies
i
endeavoured
to
guess
what
sort
of
men
they
were
and
what
their
disposition
might
be
they
lounged
about
in
front
of
me
some
with
lowered
brows
others
full
of
gaiety
one
of
these
expressions
was
seen
on
every
face
exchanged
insults
or
talked
on
indifferent
matters
sometimes
too
they
wandered
about
in
solitude
occupied
apparently
with
their
own
reflections
some
of
them
with
a
pathetic
look
others
with
a
conceited
air
of
superiority
yes
here
even
here
their
cap
balanced
on
the
side
of
their
head
their
sheepskin
coat
picturesquely
over
the
shoulder
insolence
in
their
eyes
and
mockery
on
their
lips
here
is
the
world
to
which
i
am
condemned
in
which
in
spite
of
myself
i
must
somehow
live
i
said
to
myself
i
endeavoured
to
question
akim
akimitch
with
whom
i
liked
to
take
my
tea
in
order
not
to
be
alone
for
i
wanted
to
know
something
about
the
different
convicts
in
parenthesis
i
must
say
that
the
tea
at
the
beginning
of
my
imprisonment
was
almost
my
only
food
akim
akimitch
never
refused
to
take
tea
with
me
and
he
himself
heated
our
tin
made
in
the
convict
prison
and
let
out
to
me
by
m
akim
akimitch
generally
drank
a
glass
of
tea
he
had
glasses
of
his
own
calmly
and
silently
then
thanked
me
when
he
had
finished
and
at
once
went
to
work
on
my
blanket
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
tell
me
what
i
wanted
to
know
and
did
not
even
understand
my
desire
to
know
the
dispositions
of
the
people
surrounding
me
he
listened
to
me
with
a
cunning
smile
which
i
have
still
before
my
eyes
no
i
thought
i
must
find
out
for
myself
it
is
useless
to
interrogate
others
the
fourth
day
the
convicts
were
drawn
up
in
two
ranks
early
in
the
morning
in
the
before
the
close
to
the
prison
gates
before
and
behind
them
were
soldiers
with
loaded
muskets
and
fixed
bayonets
the
soldier
has
the
right
to
fire
on
the
convict
if
he
tries
to
escape
but
on
the
other
hand
he
is
answerable
for
his
shot
if
there
was
no
absolute
necessity
for
him
to
fire
the
same
thing
applies
to
revolts
but
who
would
think
of
openly
taking
to
flight
the
engineer
officer
arrived
accompanied
by
the
conductor
and
by
some
officers
of
the
line
together
with
sappers
and
soldiers
told
off
to
superintend
the
labours
of
the
convicts
the
roll
was
called
then
the
convicts
who
were
going
to
the
workshop
started
first
these
men
worked
inside
the
prison
and
made
clothes
for
all
the
inmates
the
other
exiles
went
into
the
outer
workshops
until
at
last
arrived
the
turn
of
the
prisoners
destined
for
field
labour
i
was
of
this
number
there
were
altogether
twenty
of
us
behind
the
fortress
on
the
frozen
river
were
two
barges
belonging
to
the
government
which
were
not
worth
anything
but
which
had
to
be
taken
to
pieces
in
order
that
the
wood
might
not
be
lost
the
wood
was
in
itself
all
but
valueless
for
firewood
can
be
bought
in
the
town
at
a
nominal
price
the
whole
country
is
covered
with
forests
this
work
was
given
to
us
in
order
that
we
might
not
remain
with
our
arms
crossed
this
was
understood
on
both
sides
accordingly
we
went
to
it
apathetically
though
just
the
contrary
happened
when
work
had
to
be
done
which
would
be
profitable
or
when
a
fixed
task
was
assigned
to
us
in
this
latter
case
although
prisoners
were
to
derive
no
profit
from
their
work
they
tried
to
get
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
and
took
a
pride
in
doing
it
quickly
when
such
work
as
i
am
speaking
of
had
to
be
done
as
a
matter
of
form
rather
than
because
it
was
necessary
task
work
could
not
be
asked
for
we
had
to
go
on
until
the
beating
of
the
drum
at
eleven
called
back
the
convicts
the
day
was
warm
and
foggy
the
snow
was
on
the
point
of
melting
our
entire
band
walked
towards
the
bank
behind
the
fortress
shaking
lightly
their
chains
hid
beneath
their
garments
the
sound
came
forth
clear
and
ringing
two
or
three
convicts
went
to
get
their
tools
from
the
dépôt
i
walked
on
with
the
others
i
had
become
a
little
animated
for
i
wanted
to
see
and
know
in
what
this
field
labour
consisted
to
what
sort
of
work
i
was
condemned
and
how
i
should
do
it
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
remember
the
smallest
particulars
we
met
as
we
were
walking
along
a
townsman
with
a
long
beard
who
stopped
and
slipped
his
hand
into
his
pocket
a
prisoner
left
our
party
took
off
his
cap
and
received
alms
to
the
extent
of
five
kopecks
then
came
back
hurriedly
towards
us
the
townsman
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
went
his
way
the
five
kopecks
were
spent
the
same
morning
in
buying
cakes
of
white
bread
which
were
shared
equally
among
us
in
my
squad
some
were
gloomy
and
taciturn
others
indifferent
and
indolent
there
were
some
who
talked
in
an
idle
manner
one
of
these
men
was
extremely
gay
heaven
knows
why
he
sang
and
danced
as
we
went
along
shaking
and
ringing
his
chains
at
each
step
this
fat
and
corpulent
convict
was
the
very
one
who
on
the
very
day
of
my
arrival
during
the
general
washing
had
a
quarrel
with
one
of
his
companions
about
the
water
and
had
ventured
to
compare
him
to
some
sort
of
bird
his
name
was
scuratoff
he
finished
by
shouting
out
a
lively
song
of
which
i
remember
the
burden
they
married
me
without
my
consent
when
i
was
at
the
mill
nothing
was
wanting
but
a
balalaika
the
russian
banjo
his
extraordinary
was
justly
reproved
by
several
of
the
prisoners
who
were
offended
by
it
listen
to
his
hallooing
said
one
of
the
convicts
though
it
become
him
the
wolf
has
but
one
song
this
tuliak
inhabitant
of
tula
is
stealing
it
from
him
said
another
who
could
be
recognised
by
his
accent
as
a
little
russian
of
course
i
am
from
tula
replied
scuratoff
but
we
do
stuff
ourselves
to
bursting
as
you
do
in
your
pultava
liar
what
did
you
eat
yourself
bark
shoes
and
cabbage
soup
you
talk
as
if
the
devil
fed
you
on
sweet
almonds
broke
in
a
third
i
admit
my
friend
that
i
am
an
effeminate
man
said
scuratoff
with
a
gentle
sigh
as
though
he
were
really
reproaching
himself
for
his
effeminacy
from
my
most
tender
infancy
i
was
brought
up
in
luxury
fed
on
plums
and
delicate
cakes
my
brothers
even
now
have
a
large
business
at
moscow
they
are
wholesale
dealers
in
the
wind
that
blows
immensely
rich
men
as
you
may
imagine
and
what
did
you
sell
i
was
very
successful
and
when
i
received
my
first
two
hundred
roubles
impossible
interrupted
one
of
the
prisoners
struck
with
amazement
at
hearing
of
so
large
a
sum
no
my
good
fellow
not
two
hundred
roubles
two
hundred
blows
of
the
stick
luka
i
say
luka
some
have
the
right
to
call
me
luka
but
for
you
i
am
luka
kouzmitch
replied
rather
a
small
feeble
convict
with
a
pointed
nose
the
devil
take
you
you
are
really
not
worth
speaking
to
yet
i
wanted
to
be
civil
to
you
but
to
continue
my
story
this
is
how
it
happened
that
i
did
not
remain
any
longer
at
moscow
i
received
my
fifteen
last
strokes
and
was
then
sent
off
and
was
at
but
what
were
you
sent
for
asked
a
convict
who
had
been
listening
attentively
do
ask
stupid
questions
i
was
explaining
to
you
how
it
was
i
did
not
make
my
fortune
at
moscow
and
yet
how
anxious
i
was
to
be
rich
you
could
scarcely
imagine
how
much
many
of
the
prisoners
began
to
laugh
scuratoff
was
one
of
those
lively
persons
full
of
animal
spirits
who
take
a
pleasure
in
amusing
their
graver
companions
and
who
as
a
matter
of
course
received
no
reward
except
insults
he
belonged
to
a
type
of
men
to
whose
characteristics
i
shall
perhaps
have
to
return
and
what
a
fellow
he
is
now
observed
luka
kouzmitch
his
clothes
alone
must
be
worth
a
hundred
roubles
scuratoff
had
the
oldest
and
greasiest
sheepskin
that
could
be
seen
it
was
mended
in
many
different
places
with
pieces
that
scarcely
hung
together
he
looked
at
luka
attentively
from
head
to
foot
it
is
my
head
friend
he
said
my
head
that
is
worth
money
when
i
took
farewell
of
moscow
i
was
half
consoled
because
my
head
was
to
make
the
journey
on
my
shoulders
farewell
moscow
i
shall
never
forget
your
free
air
nor
the
tremendous
flogging
i
got
as
for
my
sheepskin
you
are
not
obliged
to
look
at
it
you
would
like
me
perhaps
to
look
at
your
head
if
it
was
really
his
own
natural
property
but
it
was
given
him
in
charity
cried
luka
kouzmitch
it
was
a
gift
made
to
him
at
tumen
when
the
convoy
was
passing
through
the
town
scuratoff
had
you
a
workshop
what
workshop
could
he
have
he
was
only
a
cobbler
said
one
of
the
convicts
it
is
true
said
scuratoff
without
noticing
the
caustic
tone
of
the
speaker
i
tried
to
mend
boots
but
i
never
got
beyond
a
single
pair
and
were
you
paid
for
them
well
i
found
a
fellow
who
certainly
neither
feared
god
nor
honoured
either
his
father
or
his
mother
and
as
a
punishment
providence
made
him
buy
the
work
of
my
hands
the
men
around
scuratoff
burst
into
a
laugh
i
also
worked
once
at
the
convict
prison
continued
scuratoff
with
imperturbable
coolness
i
did
up
the
boots
of
stepan
fedoritch
the
lieutenant
and
was
he
satisfied
no
my
dear
fellows
indeed
he
was
not
he
blackguarded
me
enough
to
last
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
he
also
pushed
me
from
behind
with
his
knee
what
a
rage
he
was
in
ah
my
life
has
deceived
me
i
see
no
fun
in
the
convict
prison
whatever
he
began
to
sing
again
akolina
husband
is
in
the
there
he
waits
again
he
sang
and
again
he
danced
and
leaped
most
unbecoming
murmured
the
little
russian
who
was
walking
by
my
side
frivolous
man
said
another
in
a
serious
decided
tone
i
could
not
make
out
why
they
insulted
scuratoff
nor
why
they
despised
those
convicts
who
were
as
they
seemed
to
do
i
attributed
the
anger
of
the
little
russian
and
the
others
to
a
feeling
of
personal
hostility
but
in
this
i
was
wrong
they
were
vexed
that
scuratoff
had
not
that
air
of
false
dignity
with
which
the
whole
of
the
convict
prison
was
impregnated
they
did
not
however
get
annoyed
with
all
the
jokers
nor
treat
them
all
like
scuratoff
some
of
them
were
men
who
would
stand
no
nonsense
and
forgive
no
one
voluntarily
or
involuntarily
it
was
necessary
to
treat
them
with
respect
there
was
in
our
band
a
convict
of
this
very
kind
a
lively
fellow
whom
i
did
not
see
in
his
true
light
until
later
on
he
was
a
tall
young
fellow
with
pleasant
manners
and
not
without
good
looks
there
was
at
the
same
time
a
very
comic
expression
on
his
face
he
was
called
the
sapper
because
he
had
served
in
the
engineers
he
belonged
to
the
special
section
but
all
the
convicts
were
not
so
particular
as
the
little
russian
who
could
not
bear
to
see
people
gay
we
had
in
our
prison
several
men
who
aimed
at
a
certain
either
in
virtue
of
skill
at
their
work
of
their
general
ingenuity
of
their
character
or
their
wit
many
of
them
were
intelligent
and
energetic
and
reached
the
point
they
were
aiming
at
that
is
to
say
and
moral
influence
over
their
companions
they
often
hated
one
another
and
they
excited
general
envy
they
looked
upon
other
convicts
with
a
dignified
air
that
was
full
of
condescension
and
they
never
quarrelled
without
a
cause
favourably
looked
upon
by
the
administration
they
in
some
measure
directed
the
work
and
none
of
them
would
have
lowered
himself
so
far
as
to
quarrel
with
a
man
about
his
songs
all
these
men
were
very
polite
to
me
during
the
whole
time
of
my
imprisonment
but
not
at
all
communicative
at
last
we
reached
the
bank
a
little
lower
down
was
the
old
hulk
which
we
were
to
break
up
stuck
fast
in
the
ice
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
was
the
blue
steppe
and
the
sad
horizon
i
expected
to
see
every
one
go
to
work
at
once
nothing
of
the
kind
some
of
the
convicts
sat
down
negligently
on
wooden
beams
that
were
lying
near
the
shore
and
nearly
all
took
from
their
pockets
pouches
containing
native
tobacco
which
was
sold
in
leaf
at
the
market
at
the
rate
of
three
kopecks
a
pound
and
short
wooden
pipes
they
lighted
them
while
the
soldiers
formed
a
circle
around
them
and
began
to
watch
us
with
a
tired
look
who
the
devil
had
the
idea
of
sinking
this
barque
asked
one
of
the
convicts
in
a
loud
voice
without
speaking
to
any
one
in
particular
were
they
very
anxious
then
to
have
it
broken
up
the
people
were
not
afraid
to
give
us
work
said
another
where
are
all
those
peasants
going
to
work
said
the
first
after
a
short
silence
he
had
not
even
heard
his
companion
answer
he
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
distance
where
a
troop
of
peasants
were
marching
in
file
across
the
virgin
snow
all
the
convicts
turned
negligently
towards
this
side
and
began
from
mere
idleness
to
laugh
at
the
peasants
as
they
approached
them
one
of
them
the
last
of
the
line
walked
very
comically
with
his
arms
apart
and
his
head
on
one
side
he
wore
a
tall
pointed
cap
his
shadow
threw
itself
in
clear
lines
on
the
white
snow
look
how
our
brother
petrovitch
is
dressed
said
one
of
my
companions
imitating
the
pronunciation
of
the
peasants
of
the
locality
one
amusing
thing
the
convicts
looked
down
on
peasants
although
they
were
for
the
most
part
peasants
by
origin
the
last
one
too
above
all
looks
as
if
he
were
planting
radishes
he
is
an
important
personage
he
has
lots
of
money
said
a
third
they
all
began
to
laugh
without
however
seeming
genuinely
amused
during
this
time
a
woman
selling
cakes
came
up
she
was
a
brisk
lively
person
and
it
was
with
her
that
the
five
kopecks
given
by
the
townsman
were
spent
the
young
fellow
who
sold
white
bread
in
the
convict
prison
took
two
dozen
of
her
cakes
and
had
a
long
discussion
with
the
woman
in
order
to
get
a
reduction
in
price
she
would
not
however
agree
to
his
terms
at
last
the
officer
appointed
to
superintend
the
work
came
up
with
a
cane
in
his
hand
what
are
you
sitting
down
for
begin
at
once
give
us
our
tasks
ivan
matveitch
said
one
of
the
foremen
among
us
as
he
slowly
got
up
what
more
do
you
want
take
out
the
barque
that
is
your
task
then
ultimately
the
convicts
got
up
and
went
to
the
river
but
very
slowly
different
directors
appeared
directors
at
least
in
words
the
barque
was
not
to
be
broken
up
anyhow
the
latitudinal
and
longitudinal
beams
were
to
be
preserved
and
this
was
not
an
easy
thing
to
manage
draw
this
beam
out
that
is
the
first
thing
to
do
cried
a
convict
who
was
neither
a
director
nor
a
foreman
but
a
simple
workman
this
man
very
quiet
and
a
little
stupid
had
not
previously
spoken
he
now
bent
down
took
hold
of
a
heavy
beam
with
both
hands
and
waited
for
some
one
to
help
him
no
one
however
seemed
inclined
to
do
so
not
you
indeed
you
will
never
manage
it
not
even
your
grandfather
the
bear
could
do
it
muttered
some
one
between
his
teeth
well
my
friend
are
we
to
begin
as
for
me
i
can
do
nothing
alone
said
with
a
morose
air
the
man
who
had
put
himself
forward
and
who
now
quitting
the
beam
held
himself
upright
unless
you
are
going
to
do
all
the
work
by
yourself
what
are
you
in
such
a
hurry
about
i
was
only
speaking
said
the
poor
fellow
excusing
himself
for
his
forwardness
must
you
have
blankets
to
keep
yourselves
warm
or
are
you
to
be
heated
for
the
winter
cried
a
officer
to
the
twenty
men
who
seemed
to
loathe
to
begin
work
go
on
at
once
it
is
never
any
use
being
in
a
hurry
ivan
matveitch
but
you
are
doing
nothing
at
all
savelieff
what
are
you
casting
your
eyes
about
for
are
they
for
sale
by
chance
come
go
on
what
can
i
do
alone
set
us
tasks
ivan
matveitch
i
told
you
before
that
i
had
no
task
to
give
you
attack
the
barque
and
when
you
have
finished
we
will
go
back
to
the
house
come
begin
the
prisoners
began
work
but
with
no
and
very
indolently
the
irritation
of
the
chief
at
seeing
these
vigorous
men
remain
so
idle
was
intelligible
enough
while
the
first
rivet
was
being
removed
it
suddenly
snapped
it
broke
to
pieces
said
the
convict
in
it
was
impossible
then
they
suggested
to
work
in
such
a
manner
what
was
to
be
done
a
long
discussion
took
place
between
the
prisoners
and
little
by
little
they
came
to
insults
nor
did
this
seem
likely
to
be
the
end
of
it
the
under
officer
cried
out
again
as
he
agitated
his
stick
but
the
second
rivet
snapped
like
the
first
it
was
then
agreed
that
hatchets
were
of
no
use
and
that
other
tools
must
be
procured
accordingly
two
prisoners
were
sent
under
escort
to
the
fortress
to
get
the
proper
instruments
waiting
their
return
the
other
convicts
sat
down
on
the
bank
as
calmly
as
possible
pulled
out
their
pipes
and
began
again
to
smoke
finally
the
under
officer
spat
with
contempt
well
he
exclaimed
the
work
you
are
doing
will
not
kill
you
oh
what
people
what
people
he
grumbled
with
an
air
he
then
made
a
gesture
and
went
away
to
the
fortress
brandishing
his
cane
after
an
hour
the
conductor
arrived
he
listened
quietly
to
what
the
convicts
had
to
say
declared
that
the
task
he
gave
them
was
to
get
off
four
rivets
unbroken
and
to
demolish
a
good
part
of
the
barque
as
soon
as
this
was
done
the
prisoners
could
go
back
to
the
house
the
task
was
a
considerable
one
but
good
heavens
how
the
convicts
now
went
to
work
where
now
was
their
idleness
their
want
of
skill
the
hatchets
soon
began
to
dance
and
soon
the
rivets
were
sprung
those
who
had
no
hatchets
made
use
of
thick
sticks
to
push
beneath
the
rivets
and
thus
in
due
time
and
in
artistic
fashion
they
got
them
out
the
convicts
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
intelligent
in
their
conversation
no
more
insults
were
heard
every
one
knew
perfectly
what
to
say
to
do
to
advise
just
before
the
beating
of
the
drum
the
appointed
task
was
executed
and
the
prisoners
returned
to
the
convict
prison
fatigued
but
pleased
to
have
gained
from
the
working
time
fixed
by
the
regulations
as
regards
myself
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
wherever
i
stood
to
help
the
workers
i
was
never
in
my
place
they
always
drove
me
away
and
generally
insulted
me
any
one
of
the
ragged
lot
any
miserable
workman
who
would
not
have
dared
to
say
a
syllable
to
the
other
convicts
all
more
intelligent
and
skilful
than
he
assumed
the
right
of
swearing
at
me
if
i
went
near
him
under
pretext
that
i
interfered
with
him
in
his
work
at
last
one
of
the
best
of
them
said
to
me
frankly
but
coarsely
what
do
you
want
here
be
off
with
you
why
do
you
come
when
no
one
calls
you
that
is
it
added
another
you
would
do
better
to
take
a
pitcher
said
a
third
and
carry
water
to
the
house
that
is
being
built
or
go
to
the
tobacco
factory
you
are
no
good
here
i
was
obliged
to
keep
apart
to
remain
idle
while
others
were
working
seemed
a
shame
but
when
i
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
barque
i
was
insulted
anew
what
men
we
have
to
work
was
the
cry
what
can
be
done
with
fellows
of
this
kind
all
this
was
said
spitefully
they
were
pleased
to
have
the
opportunity
of
laughing
at
a
gentleman
it
will
now
be
understood
that
my
first
thought
on
entering
the
convict
prison
was
to
ask
myself
how
i
should
ever
get
on
with
such
people
i
foresaw
that
such
incidents
would
often
be
repeated
but
i
resolved
not
to
change
my
conduct
in
any
way
whatever
might
be
the
result
i
had
decided
to
live
simply
and
intelligently
without
manifesting
the
least
desire
to
approach
my
companions
but
also
without
repelling
them
if
they
themselves
desired
to
approach
me
in
no
way
to
fear
their
threats
or
their
hatred
and
to
pretend
as
much
as
possible
not
to
be
affected
by
them
such
was
my
plan
i
saw
from
the
first
that
they
would
despise
me
if
i
adopted
any
other
course
when
i
returned
in
the
evening
to
the
convict
prison
having
finished
my
afternoon
work
fatigued
and
harassed
a
deep
sadness
took
possession
of
me
how
many
thousands
of
days
have
i
to
pass
like
this
one
always
the
same
thought
i
walked
about
alone
and
meditated
as
night
fell
when
suddenly
near
the
palisade
behind
the
barracks
i
saw
my
friend
bull
who
ran
towards
me
bull
was
the
dog
of
the
prison
for
the
prison
has
its
dog
as
companies
of
infantry
batteries
of
artillery
and
squadrons
of
cavalry
have
theirs
he
had
been
there
for
a
long
time
belonged
to
no
one
looked
upon
every
one
as
his
master
and
lived
on
the
remains
from
the
kitchen
he
was
a
black
dog
spotted
with
white
not
very
old
with
intelligent
eyes
and
a
bushy
tail
no
one
caressed
him
or
paid
the
least
attention
to
him
as
soon
as
i
arrived
i
made
friends
with
him
by
giving
him
a
piece
of
bread
when
i
patted
him
on
the
back
he
remained
motionless
looked
at
me
with
a
pleased
expression
and
gently
wagged
his
tail
that
evening
not
having
seen
me
the
whole
day
me
the
first
person
who
in
so
many
years
had
thought
of
caressing
him
he
ran
towards
me
leaping
and
barking
it
had
such
an
effect
on
me
that
i
could
not
help
embracing
him
i
placed
his
head
against
my
body
he
placed
his
paws
on
my
shoulders
and
looked
me
in
the
face
here
is
a
friend
sent
to
me
by
destiny
i
said
to
myself
and
during
the
first
weeks
so
full
of
pain
every
time
that
i
came
back
from
work
i
hastened
before
doing
anything
else
to
go
to
the
back
of
the
barracks
with
bull
who
leaped
with
joy
before
me
i
took
his
head
in
my
hands
and
kissed
it
at
the
same
time
a
troubled
bitter
feeling
pressed
my
heart
i
well
remember
thinking
and
taking
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
this
was
my
one
my
only
friend
in
the
world
my
faithful
dog

chapter

new
acquaintances
petroff
time
went
on
and
little
by
little
i
accustomed
myself
to
my
new
life
the
scenes
i
had
daily
before
me
no
longer
afflicted
me
so
much
in
a
word
the
convict
prison
its
inhabitants
and
its
manners
left
me
indifferent
to
get
reconciled
to
this
life
was
impossible
but
i
had
to
accept
it
as
an
inevitable
fact
i
had
driven
entirely
away
from
me
all
the
anxiety
by
which
i
had
at
first
been
troubled
i
no
longer
wandered
through
the
convict
prison
like
a
lost
soul
and
no
longer
allowed
myself
to
be
subjugated
by
my
anxiety
the
wild
curiosity
of
the
convicts
had
had
its
edge
taken
off
and
i
was
no
longer
looked
upon
with
that
affectation
or
insolence
previously
displayed
they
had
become
indifferent
to
me
and
i
was
very
glad
of
it
i
began
to
feel
at
home
in
the
barracks
i
knew
where
to
go
and
sleep
at
night
gradually
i
became
accustomed
to
things
the
very
idea
of
which
would
formerly
have
been
repugnant
to
me
i
went
every
week
regularly
to
have
my
head
shaved
we
were
called
every
saturday
one
after
another
to
the
the
regimental
barbers
lathered
our
skulls
with
cold
water
and
soap
and
scraped
us
afterwards
with
their
razors
merely
the
thought
of
this
torture
gives
me
a
shudder
i
soon
found
a
remedy
for
it
akim
akimitch
pointed
it
out
to
me
a
prisoner
in
the
military
section
who
for
one
kopeck
shaved
those
who
paid
for
it
with
his
own
razor
this
was
his
trade
many
of
the
prisoners
were
his
customers
merely
to
avoid
the
military
barbers
yet
these
were
not
men
of
weak
nerves
our
barber
was
called
the
major
why
i
can
not
say
as
far
as
i
know
he
possessed
no
points
of
resemblance
with
any
major
as
i
write
these
lines
i
see
clearly
before
me
the
major
and
his
thin
face
he
was
a
tall
fellow
silent
rather
stupid
absorbed
entirely
by
his
business
he
was
never
to
be
seen
without
a
strop
in
his
hand
on
which
day
and
night
he
sharpened
a
razor
which
was
always
in
admirable
condition
he
had
certainly
made
this
work
the
supreme
object
of
his
life
he
was
really
happy
when
his
razor
was
quite
sharp
and
his
services
were
in
request
his
soap
was
always
warm
and
he
had
a
very
light
hand
a
hand
of
velvet
he
was
proud
of
his
skill
and
used
to
take
with
a
careless
air
the
kopeck
he
received
one
might
have
thought
that
he
worked
from
love
of
his
art
and
not
in
order
to
gain
money
a
f
was
soundly
corrected
by
our
real
major
one
day
because
he
had
the
misfortune
to
say
the
major
when
he
was
speaking
of
the
barber
who
shaved
him
the
real
major
was
in
a
violent
rage
blackguard
he
cried
do
you
know
what
a
major
is
and
according
to
his
habit
he
shook
a
f
violently
the
idea
of
calling
a
scoundrel
of
a
convict
a
in
my
presence
from
the
first
day
of
my
imprisonment
i
began
to
dream
of
my
liberation
my
favourite
occupation
was
to
count
thousands
and
thousands
of
times
in
a
thousand
different
manners
the
number
of
days
that
i
should
have
to
pass
in
prison
i
thought
of
that
only
and
every
one
deprived
of
his
liberty
for
a
fixed
time
does
the
same
of
that
i
am
certain
i
can
not
say
that
all
the
convicts
had
the
same
degree
of
hopefulness
but
their
sanguine
character
often
astonished
me
the
hopefulness
of
a
prisoner
differs
essentially
from
that
of
a
free
man
the
latter
may
desire
an
amelioration
in
his
position
or
a
realisation
of
some
enterprise
which
he
has
undertaken
but
meanwhile
he
lives
he
acts
he
is
swept
away
in
the
whirlwind
of
real
life
nothing
of
the
kind
takes
place
in
the
case
of
the
convict
for
life
he
lives
also
in
a
way
but
not
being
condemned
to
a
fixed
number
of
years
he
takes
a
vaguer
view
of
his
situation
than
the
one
who
is
imprisoned
for
a
definite
term
the
man
condemned
for
a
comparatively
short
period
feels
that
he
is
not
at
home
he
looks
upon
himself
so
to
say
as
on
a
visit
he
regards
the
twenty
years
of
his
punishment
as
two
years
at
most
he
is
sure
that
at
fifty
when
he
has
finished
his
sentence
he
will
be
as
young
and
as
lively
as
at
we
have
time
before
us
he
thinks
and
he
strives
obstinately
to
dispel
discouraging
thoughts
even
a
man
sentenced
for
life
thinks
that
some
day
an
order
may
arrive
from
petersburg
transport
such
a
one
to
the
mines
at
nertchinsk
and
fix
a
term
for
his
detention
it
would
be
famous
first
because
it
takes
six
months
to
get
to
nertchinsk
and
the
life
on
the
road
is
a
hundred
times
preferable
to
the
convict
prison
he
would
finish
his
time
at
nertchinsk
and
then
more
than
one
old
man
speculates
in
this
way
at
tobolsk
i
have
seen
men
fastened
to
the
wall
by
a
chain
about
two
yards
long
by
their
side
they
have
their
bed
they
are
thus
chained
for
some
terrible
crime
committed
after
their
transportation
to
siberia
they
are
kept
chained
up
for
five
ten
years
they
are
nearly
all
brigands
and
i
only
saw
one
of
them
who
looked
like
a
man
of
good
breeding
he
had
been
in
some
branch
of
the
civil
service
and
spoke
in
a
soft
lisping
way
his
smile
was
sweet
but
sickly
he
showed
us
his
chain
and
pointed
out
to
us
the
most
convenient
way
of
lying
down
he
must
have
been
a
nice
person
all
these
poor
wretches
are
perfectly
they
all
seem
satisfied
and
yet
their
desire
to
finish
their
period
of
chains
devours
them
why
it
will
be
asked
because
then
they
will
leave
their
low
damp
stifling
cells
for
the
of
the
convict
prison
that
is
all
these
last
places
of
confinement
they
will
never
leave
they
know
that
those
who
have
once
been
chained
up
will
never
be
liberated
and
they
will
die
in
irons
they
know
all
this
and
yet
they
are
very
anxious
to
be
no
longer
chained
up
without
this
hope
could
they
remain
five
or
six
years
fastened
to
a
wall
and
not
die
or
go
mad
i
soon
understood
that
work
alone
could
save
me
by
fortifying
my
health
and
my
body
whereas
incessant
restlessness
of
mind
nervous
irritation
and
the
close
air
of
the
barracks
would
ruin
them
completely
i
should
go
out
vigorous
and
full
of
elasticity
i
did
not
deceive
myself
work
and
movement
were
very
useful
to
me
i
saw
one
of
my
comrades
to
my
terror
melt
away
like
a
piece
of
wax
and
yet
when
he
was
with
me
in
the
convict
prison
he
was
young
handsome
and
vigorous
when
he
left
his
health
was
ruined
and
his
legs
could
no
longer
support
him
his
chest
too
was
oppressed
by
asthma
no
i
said
to
myself
as
i
gazed
upon
him
i
wish
to
live
and
i
will
live
my
love
for
work
exposed
me
in
the
first
place
to
the
contempt
and
bitter
laughter
of
my
comrades
but
i
paid
no
attention
to
them
and
went
away
with
a
light
heart
wherever
i
was
sent
sometimes
for
instance
to
break
and
pound
alabaster
this
work
the
first
that
was
given
to
me
is
easy
the
engineers
did
their
utmost
to
lighten
the
of
all
the
gentlemen
this
was
not
indulgence
but
simple
justice
would
it
not
have
been
strange
to
require
the
same
work
from
a
labourer
as
from
a
man
whose
strength
was
less
by
half
and
who
had
never
worked
with
his
hands
but
we
were
not
spoilt
in
this
way
for
ever
and
we
were
only
spared
in
secret
for
we
were
severely
watched
as
real
severe
work
was
by
no
means
rare
it
often
happened
that
the
task
given
to
us
was
beyond
the
strength
of
the
gentlemen
who
thus
suffered
twice
as
much
as
their
comrades
generally
three
or
four
men
were
sent
to
pound
the
alabaster
and
nearly
always
old
men
or
feeble
ones
were
chosen
we
were
of
the
latter
class
a
man
skilled
in
this
particular
kind
of
work
was
sent
with
us
for
several
years
it
was
always
the
same
man
almazoff
by
name
he
was
severe
already
in
years
sunburnt
and
very
thin
by
no
means
communicative
moreover
and
difficult
to
get
on
with
he
despised
us
profoundly
but
he
was
of
such
a
reserved
disposition
that
he
never
broke
it
sufficient
to
call
us
names
the
shed
in
which
we
calcined
the
alabaster
was
built
on
a
sloping
and
deserted
bank
of
the
river
in
winter
on
a
foggy
day
the
view
was
sad
both
on
the
river
and
on
the
opposite
shore
even
to
a
great
distance
there
was
something
heartrending
in
this
dull
naked
landscape
but
it
was
still
sadder
when
a
brilliant
sun
shone
above
the
boundless
white
plain
how
one
would
have
liked
to
fly
away
beyond
this
steppe
which
began
on
the
opposite
shore
and
stretched
out
for
fifteen
hundred
versts
to
the
south
like
an
immense
almazoff
went
to
work
silently
with
a
disagreeable
air
we
were
ashamed
not
to
be
able
to
help
him
more
effectually
but
he
managed
to
do
his
work
without
our
assistance
and
seemed
to
wish
to
make
us
understand
that
we
were
acting
unjustly
towards
him
and
that
we
ought
to
repent
our
uselessness
our
work
consisted
in
heating
the
oven
in
order
to
calcine
the
alabaster
that
we
had
got
together
in
a
heap
the
day
following
when
the
alabaster
was
entirely
calcined
we
turned
it
out
each
one
filled
a
box
of
alabaster
which
he
afterwards
crushed
this
work
was
not
disagreeable
the
fragile
alabaster
soon
became
a
white
brilliant
dust
we
brandished
our
heavy
hammers
and
dealt
such
formidable
blows
that
we
admired
our
own
strength
when
we
were
tired
we
felt
lighter
our
cheeks
were
red
the
blood
circulated
more
rapidly
in
our
veins
almazoff
would
then
look
at
us
in
a
condescending
manner
as
he
would
have
looked
at
little
children
he
smoked
his
pipe
with
an
indulgent
air
unable
however
to
prevent
himself
from
grumbling
when
he
opened
his
mouth
he
was
never
otherwise
and
he
was
the
same
with
every
one
at
bottom
i
believe
he
was
a
kind
man
they
gave
me
another
kind
of
labour
which
consisted
in
working
the
turning
wheel
this
wheel
was
high
and
heavy
and
great
efforts
were
necessary
to
make
it
go
round
above
all
when
the
workmen
from
the
workshop
of
the
engineers
used
to
make
the
balustrade
of
a
staircase
or
the
foot
of
a
large
table
which
required
almost
the
whole
trunk
no
one
man
could
have
done
the
work
alone
to
two
convicts
b
formerly
gentleman
and
myself
this
work
was
given
nearly
always
for
several
years
whenever
there
was
anything
to
turn
b
was
weak
even
still
young
and
somewhat
sympathetic
he
had
been
sent
to
prison
a
year
before
me
with
two
companions
who
were
also
of
noble
birth
one
of
them
an
old
man
used
to
pray
day
and
night
the
prisoners
respected
him
greatly
for
it
he
died
in
prison
the
other
one
was
quite
a
young
man
strong
and
courageous
he
had
carried
his
companion
b
for
several
hundred
versts
seeing
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
he
had
fallen
down
from
fatigue
their
friendship
for
one
another
was
something
to
see
b
was
a
perfectly
man
of
noble
and
generous
disposition
but
spoiled
and
irritated
by
illness
we
used
to
turn
the
wheel
well
together
and
the
work
interested
us
as
for
me
i
found
the
exercise
most
salutary
i
was
very
too
fond
of
shovelling
away
the
snow
which
we
generally
did
after
the
hurricanes
so
frequent
in
the
winter
when
the
hurricane
had
been
raging
for
an
entire
day
more
than
one
house
would
be
buried
up
to
the
windows
even
if
it
was
not
covered
over
entirely
the
hurricane
ceased
the
sun
reappeared
and
we
were
ordered
to
disengage
the
houses
barricaded
as
they
were
by
heaps
of
snow
we
were
sent
in
large
bands
sometimes
the
whole
of
the
convicts
together
each
of
us
received
a
shovel
and
had
an
appointed
task
to
do
which
it
sometimes
seemed
impossible
to
get
through
but
we
all
went
to
work
with
a
the
light
snow
had
not
yet
congealed
and
was
frozen
only
on
the
surface
we
removed
it
in
enormous
shovelfuls
which
were
dispersed
around
us
in
the
air
the
was
as
brilliant
as
diamonds
the
shovel
sank
easily
into
the
white
glittering
mass
the
convicts
did
this
work
almost
always
with
gaiety
the
cold
winter
air
and
the
exercise
animated
them
every
one
felt
himself
in
better
spirits
laughter
and
jokes
were
heard
snowballs
were
exchanged
which
after
a
time
excited
the
indignation
of
the
convicts
who
liked
neither
laughter
nor
gaiety
accordingly
these
scenes
finished
almost
always
in
showers
of
insults
little
by
little
the
circle
of
my
acquaintances
increased
although
i
never
thought
of
making
new
ones
i
was
always
restless
morose
and
mistrustful
acquaintances
however
were
made
involuntarily
the
first
who
came
to
visit
me
was
the
convict
petroff
i
say
visit
and
i
retain
the
word
for
he
lived
in
the
special
division
which
was
at
the
farthest
end
of
the
barracks
from
mine
it
seemed
as
if
no
relations
could
exist
between
him
and
me
for
we
had
nothing
in
common
nevertheless
during
the
first
period
of
my
stay
petroff
thought
it
his
duty
to
come
towards
me
nearly
every
day
or
at
least
to
stop
me
when
after
work
i
went
for
a
stroll
at
the
back
of
the
barracks
as
far
as
possible
from
observation
his
persistence
was
disagreeable
to
me
but
he
managed
so
well
that
his
visits
became
at
last
a
pleasing
diversion
although
he
was
by
no
means
of
a
communicative
disposition
he
was
short
strongly
built
agile
and
skilful
he
had
rather
an
agreeable
voice
and
high
a
bold
look
and
white
regular
teeth
he
had
always
a
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
mouth
between
the
lower
lip
and
the
gums
many
of
the
convicts
had
the
habit
of
chewing
he
seemed
to
me
younger
than
he
really
was
for
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
thirty
and
he
was
really
forty
he
spoke
to
me
without
any
ceremony
and
behaved
to
me
on
a
footing
of
equality
with
civility
and
attention
if
for
instance
he
saw
that
i
wished
to
be
alone
he
would
talk
to
me
for
about
two
minutes
and
then
go
away
he
thanked
me
moreover
each
time
for
my
kindness
in
conversing
with
him
which
he
never
did
to
any
one
else
i
must
add
that
his
relations
underwent
no
change
not
only
during
the
first
period
of
my
story
but
for
several
years
and
that
they
never
became
more
intimate
although
he
was
really
my
friend
i
never
could
say
exactly
what
he
looked
for
in
my
society
nor
why
he
came
every
day
to
see
me
he
robbed
me
sometimes
but
almost
involuntarily
he
never
came
to
me
to
borrow
money
so
that
what
attracted
him
was
not
personal
interest
it
seemed
to
me
i
know
not
why
that
this
man
did
not
live
in
the
same
prison
with
me
but
in
another
house
in
the
town
far
away
it
appeared
as
though
he
had
come
to
the
convict
prison
by
chance
in
order
to
pick
up
news
to
inquire
for
me
in
short
to
see
how
i
was
getting
on
he
was
always
in
a
hurry
as
though
he
had
left
some
one
for
a
moment
who
was
waiting
for
him
or
as
if
he
had
given
up
for
a
time
some
matter
of
business
and
yet
he
never
hurried
himself
his
look
was
strongly
fixed
with
a
slight
air
of
levity
and
irony
he
had
a
habit
of
looking
into
the
distance
above
the
objects
near
him
as
though
he
were
endeavouring
to
distinguish
something
behind
the
person
to
whom
he
was
talking
he
always
seemed
i
sometimes
asked
myself
where
he
went
when
he
left
me
where
could
petroff
be
so
anxiously
expected
he
would
simply
go
with
a
light
step
to
one
of
the
barracks
or
to
the
kitchen
and
sit
down
to
hear
the
conversation
he
listened
attentively
and
joined
in
with
animation
after
which
he
would
suddenly
become
silent
but
whether
he
spoke
or
kept
silent
one
could
always
see
on
his
countenance
that
he
had
business
somewhere
else
and
that
some
one
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
town
not
very
far
away
the
most
astonishing
thing
was
that
he
never
had
any
business
apart
of
course
from
the
hard
labour
assigned
to
him
he
knew
no
trade
and
had
scarcely
ever
any
money
but
that
did
not
seem
to
grieve
him
why
did
he
speak
to
me
his
conversation
was
as
strange
as
he
himself
was
singular
when
he
noticed
that
i
was
walking
alone
at
the
back
of
the
barracks
he
made
a
stand
and
turned
towards
me
he
walked
very
fast
and
when
i
turned
he
was
suddenly
on
his
heel
he
approached
me
walking
but
so
quickly
that
he
seemed
to
be
going
at
a
run
i
am
not
disturbing
you
no
i
wish
to
ask
you
something
about
napoleon
i
wanted
to
ask
you
if
he
is
not
a
relation
of
the
one
who
came
to
us
in
the
year
petroff
was
a
soldier
son
and
knew
how
to
read
and
write
of
course
he
is
people
say
he
is
president
what
president
and
of
what
his
questions
were
always
rapid
and
abrupt
as
though
he
wished
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
what
he
asked
i
explained
to
him
of
what
napoleon
was
president
and
i
added
that
perhaps
he
would
become
emperor
how
will
that
be
i
explained
it
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
petroff
listened
with
attention
he
understood
perfectly
all
i
told
him
and
added
as
he
leant
his
ear
towards
me
hem
ah
i
wished
to
ask
you
alexander
petrovitch
if
there
are
really
monkeys
who
have
hands
instead
of
feet
and
are
as
tall
as
a
man
yes
what
are
they
like
i
described
them
to
him
and
told
him
what
i
knew
on
the
subject
and
where
do
they
live
in
warm
climates
there
are
some
to
be
found
in
the
island
of
sumatra
is
that
in
america
i
have
heard
that
people
there
walk
with
their
heads
downwards
no
no
you
are
thinking
of
the
antipodes
i
explained
to
him
as
well
as
i
could
what
america
was
and
what
the
antipodes
he
listened
to
me
as
attentively
as
if
the
question
of
the
antipodes
had
alone
caused
him
to
approach
me
ah
ah
i
read
last
year
the
story
of
the
countess
de
la
vallière
arevieff
had
bought
this
book
from
the
adjutant
is
it
true
or
is
it
an
invention
the
work
is
by
dumas
it
is
an
invention
no
doubt
ah
indeed
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
and
petroff
disappeared
the
above
may
be
taken
as
a
specimen
of
our
ordinary
conversation
i
made
inquiries
about
him
m
thought
he
had
better
speak
to
me
on
the
subject
when
he
learnt
what
an
acquaintance
i
had
made
he
told
me
that
many
convicts
had
excited
his
horror
on
their
arrival
but
not
one
of
them
not
even
gazin
had
produced
upon
him
such
a
frightful
impression
as
this
petroff
he
is
the
most
resolute
most
to
be
feared
of
all
the
convicts
said
m
he
is
capable
of
anything
nothing
stops
him
if
he
has
a
caprice
he
will
assassinate
you
if
the
fancy
takes
him
without
hesitation
and
without
the
least
remorse
i
often
think
he
is
not
in
his
right
senses
this
declaration
interested
me
extremely
but
m
was
never
able
to
tell
me
why
he
had
such
an
opinion
of
petroff
strangely
enough
for
many
years
together
i
saw
this
man
and
talked
with
him
nearly
every
day
he
was
always
my
sincere
friend
though
i
could
not
at
the
time
tell
why
and
during
the
whole
time
he
lived
very
quietly
and
did
nothing
extreme
i
am
moreover
convinced
that
m
was
right
and
that
he
was
perhaps
a
most
intrepid
man
and
the
most
difficult
to
restrain
in
the
whole
prison
and
why
so
i
can
scarcely
explain
this
petroff
was
that
very
convict
who
when
he
was
called
up
to
receive
his
punishment
had
wished
to
kill
the
major
i
have
told
you
the
latter
was
saved
by
a
miracle
that
he
had
gone
away
one
minute
before
the
punishment
was
inflicted
once
when
he
was
still
a
soldier
before
his
arrival
at
the
convict
prison
his
colonel
had
struck
him
on
parade
probably
he
had
often
been
beaten
before
but
that
day
he
was
not
in
a
humour
to
bear
an
insult
in
open
day
before
the
battalion
drawn
up
in
line
he
killed
his
colonel
i
do
know
all
the
details
of
the
story
for
he
never
told
it
to
me
himself
it
must
be
understood
that
these
explosions
only
took
place
when
the
nature
within
him
spoke
too
loudly
and
these
occasions
were
rare
as
a
rule
he
was
serious
and
even
quiet
his
strong
ardent
passions
were
not
burnt
out
but
smouldering
like
burning
coals
beneath
ashes
i
never
noticed
that
he
was
vain
or
given
to
bragging
like
so
many
other
convicts
he
hardly
ever
quarrelled
but
he
was
on
friendly
relations
with
scarcely
any
one
except
perhaps
sirotkin
and
then
only
when
he
had
need
of
him
i
saw
him
however
one
day
seriously
irritated
some
one
had
offended
him
by
refusing
him
something
he
wanted
he
was
disputing
on
the
point
with
a
tall
convict
as
vigorous
as
an
athlete
named
vassili
antonoff
known
for
his
nagging
spiteful
disposition
the
man
however
who
belonged
to
the
class
of
civil
convicts
was
far
from
being
a
coward
they
shouted
at
one
another
for
some
time
and
i
thought
the
quarrel
would
finish
like
so
many
others
of
the
same
kind
by
simple
interchange
of
abuse
the
affair
took
an
unexpected
turn
petroff
only
suddenly
turned
pale
his
lips
trembled
and
turned
blue
his
respiration
became
difficult
he
got
up
and
slowly
very
slowly
and
with
imperceptible
steps
he
liked
to
walk
about
with
his
feet
naked
approached
antonoff
at
once
the
noise
of
shouting
gave
place
to
a
silence
a
fly
passing
through
the
air
might
have
been
heard
every
one
anxiously
awaited
the
event
antonoff
pointed
to
his
adversary
his
face
was
no
longer
human
i
was
unable
to
endure
the
scene
and
i
left
the
prison
i
was
certain
that
before
i
got
to
the
staircase
i
should
hear
the
shrieks
of
a
man
who
was
being
murdered
but
nothing
of
the
kind
took
place
before
petroff
had
succeeded
in
getting
up
to
antonoff
the
latter
threw
him
the
object
which
had
caused
the
quarrel
a
miserable
rag
a
piece
of
lining
of
course
afterwards
antonoff
did
not
fail
to
call
petroff
names
merely
as
a
matter
of
conscience
and
from
a
feeling
of
what
was
right
in
order
to
show
that
he
had
not
been
too
much
afraid
but
petroff
paid
no
attention
to
his
insults
he
did
not
even
answer
him
everything
had
ended
to
his
advantage
and
the
insults
scarcely
affected
him
he
was
glad
to
have
got
his
piece
of
rag
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
strolling
about
the
barracks
quite
unoccupied
looking
for
some
group
whose
conversation
might
possibly
gratify
his
curiosity
everything
seemed
to
interest
him
and
yet
he
remained
apparently
indifferent
to
all
he
heard
he
might
have
been
compared
to
a
workman
a
vigorous
workman
whom
the
work
fears
but
who
for
the
moment
has
nothing
to
do
and
condescends
meanwhile
to
put
out
his
strength
in
playing
with
his
children
i
did
not
understand
why
he
remained
in
prison
why
he
did
not
escape
he
would
not
have
hesitated
to
get
away
if
he
had
really
desired
to
do
so
reason
has
no
power
on
people
like
petroff
unless
they
are
spurred
on
by
will
when
they
desire
something
there
are
no
obstacles
in
their
way
i
am
certain
that
he
would
have
been
clever
enough
to
escape
that
he
would
have
deceived
every
one
that
he
would
have
remained
for
a
time
without
eating
hid
in
a
forest
or
in
the
bulrushes
of
the
river
but
the
idea
had
evidently
not
occurred
to
him
i
never
noticed
in
him
much
judgment
or
good
sense
people
like
him
are
born
with
one
idea
which
without
being
aware
of
it
pursues
them
all
their
life
they
wander
until
they
meet
with
some
object
which
apparently
excites
their
desire
and
then
they
do
not
mind
risking
their
head
i
was
sometimes
astonished
that
a
man
who
had
assassinated
his
colonel
for
having
been
struck
would
lie
down
without
opposition
beneath
the
rods
for
he
was
always
flogged
when
he
was
detected
introducing
spirits
into
the
prison
like
all
those
who
had
no
settled
occupation
he
smuggled
in
spirits
then
if
caught
he
would
allow
himself
to
be
whipped
as
though
he
consented
to
the
punishment
and
confessed
himself
in
the
wrong
otherwise
they
would
have
killed
him
rather
than
make
him
lie
down
more
than
once
i
was
astonished
to
see
that
he
was
robbing
me
in
spite
of
his
affection
for
me
but
he
did
so
from
time
to
time
thus
he
stole
my
bible
which
i
had
asked
him
to
carry
to
its
place
he
had
only
a
few
steps
to
go
but
on
his
way
he
met
with
a
purchaser
to
whom
he
sold
the
book
at
once
spending
the
money
he
had
received
on
vodka
probably
he
felt
that
day
a
violent
desire
for
drink
and
when
he
desired
something
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
have
it
a
man
like
petroff
will
assassinate
any
one
for
kopecks
simply
to
get
himself
a
pint
of
vodka
on
any
other
occasion
he
will
disdain
hundreds
and
thousands
of
roubles
he
told
me
the
same
evening
of
the
theft
he
had
committed
but
without
showing
the
least
sign
of
repentance
or
confusion
in
a
perfectly
indifferent
tone
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
an
ordinary
incident
i
endeavoured
to
reprove
him
as
he
deserved
for
i
regretted
the
loss
of
my
bible
he
listened
to
me
without
hesitation
very
calmly
he
agreed
that
the
bible
was
a
very
useful
book
and
sincerely
regretted
that
i
had
it
no
longer
but
he
was
not
for
one
moment
sorry
though
he
had
stolen
it
he
looked
at
me
with
such
assurance
that
i
gave
up
scolding
him
he
bore
my
reproaches
because
he
thought
i
could
not
do
otherwise
than
i
was
doing
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
be
punished
for
such
an
action
and
consequently
thought
i
ought
to
abuse
him
for
my
own
satisfaction
and
to
console
myself
for
my
loss
but
in
his
inner
heart
he
considered
that
it
was
all
nonsense
to
which
a
serious
man
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
descend
i
believe
even
that
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
child
an
infant
who
does
not
yet
understand
the
simplest
things
in
the
world
if
i
spoke
to
him
of
anything
except
books
and
matters
of
knowledge
he
would
answer
me
but
only
from
politeness
and
in
laconic
phrases
i
wondered
what
made
him
question
me
so
much
on
the
subject
of
books
i
looked
at
him
carefully
during
our
conversation
to
assure
myself
that
he
was
not
laughing
at
me
but
no
he
listened
seriously
and
with
an
attention
which
was
genuine
though
not
always
maintained
this
latter
circumstance
irritated
me
sometimes
the
questions
he
put
to
me
were
clear
and
precise
and
he
always
seemed
prepared
for
the
answer
he
had
made
up
his
mind
once
for
all
that
it
was
no
use
speaking
to
me
as
to
other
matters
and
that
apart
from
books
i
understood
nothing
i
am
certain
that
he
was
attached
to
me
and
much
that
fact
astonished
me
but
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
child
or
as
an
imperfect
man
he
felt
for
me
that
sort
of
compassion
which
every
stronger
being
feels
for
a
weaker
he
took
me
for
i
do
not
know
what
he
took
me
for
although
this
compassion
did
not
prevent
him
from
robbing
me
i
am
sure
that
in
doing
so
he
pitied
me
what
a
strange
person
he
must
have
said
to
himself
as
he
lay
hands
on
my
property
he
does
not
even
know
how
to
take
care
of
what
he
possesses
that
i
think
is
why
he
liked
me
one
day
he
said
to
me
as
if
involuntarily
you
are
too
you
are
so
simple
so
simple
that
one
can
not
help
pitying
you
do
not
be
offended
at
what
i
was
saying
to
you
alexander
petrovitch
he
added
a
minute
afterwards
it
is
not
people
like
petroff
will
sometimes
in
times
of
trouble
and
excitement
manifest
themselves
in
a
forcible
manner
then
they
find
the
kind
of
activity
which
suits
them
they
are
not
men
of
words
they
could
not
be
instigators
and
chiefs
of
insurrections
but
they
are
the
men
who
execute
and
act
they
act
simply
without
any
fuss
and
run
just
to
throw
themselves
against
an
obstacle
with
bared
breast
neither
thinking
nor
fearing
every
one
follows
them
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
where
they
generally
leave
their
life
i
do
not
think
petroff
can
have
ended
well
he
was
marked
for
a
violent
end
and
if
he
is
not
yet
dead
that
only
means
that
the
opportunity
has
not
yet
presented
itself
who
knows
however
he
will
perhaps
die
of
extreme
old
age
quite
quietly
after
having
wandered
through
life
here
and
there
without
an
object
but
i
believe
m
was
right
and
that
petroff
was
the
most
determined
man
in
the
whole
convict
prison
chapter
ix
men
of
determination
luka
it
is
difficult
to
speak
of
these
men
of
determination
in
the
convict
prison
as
elsewhere
they
are
rare
they
can
be
known
by
the
fear
they
inspire
people
beware
of
them
an
irresistible
feeling
urged
me
first
of
all
to
turn
away
from
them
but
i
afterwards
changed
my
point
of
view
even
in
regard
to
the
most
frightful
murderers
there
are
men
who
have
never
killed
any
one
and
who
nevertheless
are
more
atrocious
than
those
who
have
assassinated
six
persons
it
is
impossible
to
form
an
idea
of
certain
crimes
of
so
strange
a
nature
are
they
a
type
of
murderers
that
one
often
meets
with
is
the
following
a
man
lives
calmly
and
peacefully
his
fate
is
a
hard
one
but
he
puts
up
with
it
he
is
a
peasant
attached
to
the
soil
a
domestic
serf
a
shopkeeper
or
a
soldier
suddenly
he
finds
something
give
way
within
him
what
he
has
hitherto
suffered
he
can
bear
no
longer
and
he
plunges
his
knife
into
the
breast
of
his
oppressor
or
his
enemy
he
then
goes
beyond
all
measure
he
has
killed
his
oppressor
his
enemy
that
can
be
understood
there
was
cause
for
that
crime
but
afterwards
he
does
not
assassinate
his
enemies
alone
but
the
first
person
he
happens
to
meet
he
kills
for
the
pleasure
of
killing
for
an
abusive
word
for
a
look
to
make
an
equal
number
or
only
because
some
one
is
standing
in
his
way
he
behaves
like
a
drunken
man
a
man
in
a
delirium
when
once
he
has
passed
the
fatal
line
he
is
himself
astonished
to
find
that
nothing
sacred
exists
for
him
he
breaks
through
all
laws
defies
all
powers
and
gives
himself
boundless
license
he
enjoys
the
agitation
of
his
own
heart
and
the
terror
that
he
inspires
he
knows
all
the
same
that
a
frightful
punishment
awaits
him
his
sensations
are
probably
like
those
of
a
man
who
looking
down
from
a
high
tower
on
to
the
abyss
yawning
at
his
feet
would
be
happy
to
throw
himself
head
first
into
it
in
order
to
bring
everything
to
an
end
that
is
what
happens
with
even
the
most
quiet
the
most
commonplace
individuals
there
are
some
even
who
give
themselves
airs
in
this
extremity
the
more
they
were
quiet
before
the
more
they
now
swagger
and
seek
to
inspire
fear
the
desperate
men
enjoy
the
horror
they
cause
they
take
pleasure
in
the
disgust
they
excite
they
perform
acts
of
madness
from
despair
and
care
nothing
how
it
must
all
end
or
seem
impatient
that
it
should
end
as
soon
as
possible
the
most
curious
thing
is
that
their
excitement
their
exaltation
will
last
until
the
pillory
after
that
the
thread
is
cut
the
moment
is
fatal
and
the
man
becomes
suddenly
calm
or
rather
he
becomes
extinct
a
thing
without
feeling
in
the
pillory
all
his
strength
fails
him
and
he
begs
pardon
of
the
people
once
at
the
convict
prison
he
is
quite
different
no
one
would
ever
imagine
that
this
chicken
had
killed
five
or
six
men
there
are
some
men
whom
the
convict
prison
does
not
easily
subdue
they
preserve
a
certain
swagger
a
spirit
of
bravado
i
say
i
am
not
what
you
take
me
for
i
have
sent
six
fellows
out
of
the
world
you
will
hear
them
boast
but
sooner
or
later
they
have
all
to
submit
from
time
to
time
the
murderer
will
amuse
himself
by
recalling
his
audacity
his
lawlessness
when
he
was
in
a
state
of
despair
he
likes
at
these
moments
to
have
some
silly
fellow
before
whom
he
can
brag
and
to
whom
he
will
relate
his
heroic
deeds
by
pretending
not
to
have
the
least
wish
to
astonish
him
that
is
the
sort
of
man
i
am
he
says
and
with
what
a
refinement
of
prudent
conceit
he
watches
him
while
he
is
delivering
his
narrative
in
his
accent
in
every
word
this
can
be
perceived
where
did
he
acquire
this
particular
kind
of
artfulness
during
the
long
evening
of
one
of
the
first
days
of
my
confinement
i
was
listening
to
one
of
these
conversations
thanks
to
my
inexperience
i
took
the
narrator
for
the
malefactor
a
man
with
an
iron
character
a
man
to
whom
petroff
was
nothing
the
narrator
luka
kouzmitch
had
knocked
over
a
major
for
no
other
reason
but
that
it
pleased
him
to
do
so
this
luka
kouzmitch
was
the
smallest
and
thinnest
man
in
all
the
barracks
he
was
from
the
south
he
had
been
a
serf
one
of
those
not
attached
to
the
soil
but
who
serve
their
masters
as
domestics
there
was
something
cutting
and
haughty
in
his
demeanour
he
was
a
little
bird
but
had
a
beak
and
nails
the
convicts
sum
up
a
man
instinctively
they
thought
nothing
of
this
one
he
was
too
susceptible
and
too
full
of
conceit
that
evening
he
was
stitching
a
shirt
seated
on
his
close
to
him
was
a
stupid
but
and
obliging
fellow
a
sort
of
colossus
kobylin
by
name
luka
often
quarrelled
with
him
in
a
neighbourly
way
and
treated
him
with
a
haughtiness
which
thanks
to
his
kobylin
did
not
notice
in
the
least
he
was
knitting
a
stocking
and
listening
to
luka
with
an
indifferent
air
luka
spoke
in
a
loud
voice
and
very
distinctly
he
wished
every
one
to
hear
him
though
he
was
apparently
speaking
only
to
kobylin
i
was
sent
away
said
luka
sticking
his
needle
in
the
shirt
as
a
brigand
how
long
ago
asked
kobylin
when
the
peas
are
ripe
it
will
be
just
a
year
well
we
got
to
k
v
and
i
was
put
into
the
convict
prison
around
me
there
were
a
dozen
men
from
little
russia
solid
robust
fellows
like
oxen
and
how
quiet
the
food
was
bad
the
major
of
the
prison
did
what
he
liked
one
day
passed
then
another
and
i
soon
saw
that
all
these
fellows
were
cowards
are
afraid
of
such
an
idiot
i
said
to
them
and
talk
to
him
yourself
and
they
burst
out
laughing
like
brutes
that
they
were
i
held
my
tongue
there
was
one
fellow
so
droll
so
droll
added
the
narrator
now
leaving
kobylin
to
address
all
who
chose
to
listen
this
droll
fellow
was
telling
them
how
he
had
been
tried
what
he
had
said
and
how
he
had
wept
with
hot
tears
was
a
dog
of
a
clerk
there
he
said
did
nothing
but
write
and
take
down
every
word
i
said
i
told
him
i
wished
him
at
the
devil
and
he
actually
wrote
that
down
he
troubled
me
so
that
i
quite
lost
my
head
give
me
some
thread
vasili
the
house
thread
is
bad
rotten
there
is
some
from
the
tailor
shop
replied
vasili
handing
it
over
to
him
well
but
about
this
major
said
kobylin
who
had
been
quite
forgotten
luka
was
only
waiting
for
that
he
did
not
go
on
at
once
with
his
story
as
though
kobylin
were
not
worth
such
a
mark
of
attention
he
threaded
his
needle
quietly
bent
his
legs
lazily
beneath
him
and
at
last
continued
as
follows
i
excited
the
fellows
to
such
an
extent
that
they
all
called
out
against
the
major
that
same
morning
i
had
borrowed
the
prison
slang
for
knife
from
my
neighbour
and
had
hid
it
so
as
to
be
ready
for
anything
when
the
major
arrived
he
was
as
furious
as
a
madman
now
you
little
russians
i
whispered
to
them
is
not
the
time
for
fear
but
dear
me
all
their
courage
had
slipped
down
to
the
soles
of
their
feet
they
trembled
the
major
came
in
he
was
quite
drunk
is
this
how
do
you
dare
i
am
your
tzar
your
god
he
cried
when
he
said
that
he
was
the
tzar
and
god
i
went
up
to
him
with
my
knife
in
my
sleeve
i
said
to
him
high
nobility
and
i
got
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
can
not
be
your
high
nobility
can
not
be
our
tzar
and
our
god
you
are
the
man
it
is
you
cried
the
major
are
the
leader
of
them
i
answered
and
i
got
still
nearer
to
him
your
high
nobility
as
every
one
knows
and
as
you
yourself
know
the
god
present
everywhere
is
alone
in
heaven
and
we
have
only
one
tzar
placed
above
every
one
else
by
god
himself
he
is
our
monarch
your
high
nobility
and
your
high
nobility
you
are
as
yet
only
major
and
you
are
our
chief
only
by
the
grace
of
the
tzar
and
by
your
merits
how
how
stammered
the
major
he
could
not
speak
so
astounded
was
he
this
is
how
i
answered
and
i
threw
myself
upon
him
and
thrust
my
knife
into
his
belly
up
to
the
hilt
it
had
been
done
very
quickly
the
major
tottered
turned
and
fell
i
had
thrown
my
life
away
you
fellows
i
cried
is
for
you
to
pick
him
up
i
will
here
make
a
digression
from
my
narrative
the
expression
i
am
the
tzar
i
am
god
and
other
similar
ones
were
once
unfortunately
too
often
employed
in
the
good
old
times
by
many
commanders
i
must
admit
that
their
number
has
seriously
diminished
and
perhaps
even
the
last
has
already
disappeared
let
me
observe
that
those
who
spoke
in
this
way
were
above
all
men
promoted
from
the
ranks
the
grade
of
officer
had
turned
their
brain
upside
down
after
having
laboured
long
years
beneath
the
knapsack
they
suddenly
found
themselves
officers
commanders
and
nobles
above
all
thanks
to
their
not
being
accustomed
to
it
and
to
the
first
excitement
caused
by
their
promotion
they
contracted
an
exaggerated
idea
of
their
power
and
importance
relatively
to
their
subordinates
before
their
superiors
such
men
are
revoltingly
servile
the
most
fawning
of
them
will
even
say
to
their
superiors
that
they
have
been
common
soldiers
and
that
they
do
not
forget
their
place
but
towards
their
inferiors
they
are
despots
without
mercy
nothing
irritates
the
convicts
so
much
as
such
abuses
these
overweening
opinions
of
their
own
greatness
this
exaggerated
idea
of
their
immunity
causes
hatred
in
the
hearts
of
the
most
submissive
men
and
drives
the
most
patient
to
excesses
fortunately
all
this
dates
from
a
time
that
is
almost
forgotten
and
even
then
the
superior
authorities
used
to
deal
very
severely
with
abuses
of
power
i
know
more
than
one
example
of
it
what
exasperates
the
convicts
above
all
is
disdain
or
repugnance
manifested
by
any
one
in
dealing
with
them
those
who
think
that
it
is
only
necessary
to
feed
and
clothe
the
prisoner
and
to
act
towards
him
in
all
things
according
to
the
law
are
much
mistaken
however
much
debased
he
may
be
a
man
exacts
instinctively
respect
for
his
character
as
a
man
every
prisoner
knows
perfectly
that
he
is
a
convict
and
a
reprobate
and
knows
the
distance
which
separates
him
from
his
superiors
but
neither
the
branding
irons
nor
chains
will
make
him
forget
that
he
is
a
man
he
must
therefore
be
treated
with
humanity
humane
treatment
may
raise
up
one
in
whom
the
divine
image
has
long
been
obscured
it
is
with
the
unfortunate
above
all
that
humane
conduct
is
necessary
it
is
their
salvation
their
only
joy
i
have
met
with
some
chiefs
of
a
kind
and
noble
character
and
i
have
seen
what
a
beneficent
influence
they
exercised
over
the
poor
humiliated
men
entrusted
to
their
care
a
few
affable
words
have
a
wonderful
moral
effect
upon
the
prisoners
they
render
them
as
happy
as
children
and
make
them
sincerely
grateful
towards
their
chiefs
one
other
remark
they
do
not
like
their
chiefs
to
be
familiar
and
too
much
with
them
they
wish
to
respect
them
and
familiarity
would
prevent
this
the
prisoners
will
feel
proud
for
instance
if
their
chief
has
a
number
of
decorations
if
he
has
good
manners
if
he
is
by
a
powerful
superior
if
he
is
severe
but
at
the
same
time
just
and
possesses
a
consciousness
of
dignity
the
convicts
prefer
such
a
man
to
all
others
he
knows
what
he
is
worth
and
does
not
insult
others
everything
then
is
for
the
best
you
got
well
skinned
for
that
i
suppose
asked
kobylin
as
for
being
skinned
indeed
there
is
no
denying
it
ali
give
me
the
scissors
but
what
next
are
we
not
going
to
play
at
cards
the
cards
we
drank
up
long
ago
remarked
vassili
if
we
had
not
sold
them
to
get
drink
they
would
be
here
now
if
ifs
fetch
a
hundred
roubles
a
piece
on
the
moscow
market
well
luka
what
did
you
get
for
sticking
him
asked
kobylin
it
brought
me
five
hundred
strokes
my
friend
it
did
indeed
they
did
all
but
kill
me
said
luka
once
more
addressing
the
assembly
and
without
heeding
his
neighbour
kobylin
when
they
gave
me
those
five
hundred
strokes
i
was
treated
with
great
ceremony
i
had
never
before
been
flogged
what
a
mass
of
people
came
to
see
me
the
whole
town
had
assembled
to
see
the
brigand
the
murderer
receive
his
punishment
how
stupid
the
populace
is
i
can
not
tell
you
to
what
extent
timoshka
the
executioner
undressed
me
and
laid
me
down
and
cried
out
out
i
am
going
to
grill
you
i
waited
for
the
first
stroke
i
wanted
to
cry
out
but
could
not
it
was
no
use
opening
my
mouth
my
voice
had
gone
when
he
gave
me
the
second
stroke
you
need
not
believe
me
unless
you
please
i
did
not
hear
when
they
counted
two
i
returned
to
myself
and
heard
them
count
seventeen
four
times
they
took
me
down
from
the
board
to
let
me
breathe
for
and
to
souse
me
with
cold
water
i
stared
at
them
with
my
eyes
starting
from
my
head
and
said
to
myself
shall
die
here
but
you
did
not
die
remarked
kobylin
innocently
luka
looked
at
him
with
disdain
and
every
one
burst
out
laughing
what
an
idiot
is
he
wrong
in
the
upper
storey
said
luka
as
if
he
regretted
that
he
had
condescended
to
speak
to
such
an
idiot
he
is
a
little
mad
said
vassili
on
his
side
although
luka
had
killed
six
persons
no
one
was
ever
afraid
of
him
in
the
prison
he
wished
however
to
be
looked
upon
as
a
terrible
person
chapter

fomitch
the
bath
baklouchin
but
the
christmas
holidays
were
approaching
and
the
convicts
looked
forward
to
them
with
solemnity
from
their
mere
appearance
it
was
easy
to
see
that
something
extraordinary
was
about
to
arrive
four
days
before
the
holidays
they
were
to
be
taken
to
the
bath
every
one
was
pleased
and
was
making
preparations
we
were
to
go
there
after
dinner
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
work
in
the
afternoon
and
of
all
the
convicts
the
one
who
was
most
pleased
and
showed
the
greatest
activity
was
a
certain
isaiah
fomitch
bumstein
a
jew
of
whom
i
spoke
in
my
fifth
chapter
he
liked
to
remain
stewing
in
the
bath
until
he
became
unconscious
whenever
i
think
of
the
prisoner
bath
which
is
a
thing
not
to
be
forgotten
the
first
thought
that
presents
itself
to
my
memory
is
of
that
very
glorious
and
eternally
to
be
remembered
isaiah
fomitch
bumstein
my
prison
companion
good
lord
what
a
strange
man
he
was
i
have
already
said
a
few
words
about
his
face
he
was
fifty
years
of
age
his
face
wrinkled
with
frightful
scars
on
his
cheeks
and
on
his
forehead
and
the
thin
weak
body
of
a
fowl
his
face
expressed
perpetual
confidence
in
himself
and
i
may
almost
say
perfect
happiness
i
do
not
think
he
was
at
all
sorry
to
be
condemned
to
hard
labour
he
was
a
jeweller
by
trade
and
as
there
was
no
other
in
the
town
he
had
always
plenty
of
work
to
do
and
was
more
or
less
well
paid
he
wanted
nothing
and
lived
so
to
say
sumptuously
without
spending
all
that
he
gained
for
he
saved
money
and
lent
it
out
to
the
other
convicts
at
interest
he
possessed
a
a
mattress
a
and
a
blanket
the
jews
of
the
town
did
not
refuse
him
their
patronage
every
saturday
he
went
under
escort
to
the
synagogue
which
was
authorised
by
the
law
and
he
lived
like
a
fighting
cock
nevertheless
he
looked
forward
to
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
imprisonment
in
order
to
get
married
he
was
the
most
comic
mixture
of
simplicity
stupidity
cunning
timidity
and
bashfulness
but
the
strangest
thing
was
that
the
convicts
never
laughed
or
seriously
mocked
him
they
only
teased
him
for
amusement
isaiah
fomitch
was
a
subject
of
distraction
and
amusement
for
every
one
we
have
only
one
isaiah
fomitch
we
will
take
care
of
him
the
convicts
seemed
to
say
and
as
if
he
understood
this
he
was
proud
of
his
own
importance
from
the
account
given
to
me
it
appeared
he
had
entered
the
convict
prison
in
the
most
laughable
manner
it
took
place
before
my
arrival
suddenly
one
evening
a
report
was
spread
in
the
convict
prison
that
a
jew
had
been
brought
there
who
at
that
moment
was
being
shaved
in
the
and
that
he
was
immediately
afterwards
to
be
taken
to
the
barracks
as
there
was
not
a
single
jew
in
the
prison
the
convicts
looked
forward
to
his
entry
with
impatience
and
surrounded
him
as
soon
as
he
passed
the
great
gates
the
officer
on
service
took
him
to
the
civil
prison
and
pointed
out
the
place
where
his
plank
bedstead
was
to
be
isaiah
fomitch
held
in
his
hand
a
bag
containing
the
things
given
to
him
and
some
other
things
of
his
own
he
put
down
his
bag
took
his
place
at
the
plank
bedstead
and
sat
down
there
with
his
legs
crossed
without
daring
to
raise
his
eyes
people
were
laughing
all
round
him
the
convicts
ridiculed
him
by
reason
of
his
jewish
origin
suddenly
a
young
convict
left
the
others
and
came
up
to
him
carrying
in
his
hand
an
old
pair
of
summer
trousers
dirty
torn
and
mended
with
old
rags
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
isaiah
fomitch
and
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
well
my
dear
fellow
said
he
i
have
been
waiting
for
the
last
six
years
look
up
and
tell
me
how
much
you
will
give
for
this
article
holding
up
his
rags
before
him
isaiah
fomitch
was
so
dumbfounded
that
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
mocking
crowd
with
mutilated
and
frightful
countenances
now
grouped
around
him
and
did
not
speak
a
single
word
so
frightened
was
he
when
he
saw
who
was
speaking
to
him
he
shuddered
and
began
to
examine
the
rags
carefully
every
one
waited
to
hear
his
first
words
well
can
not
you
give
me
a
silver
rouble
for
it
it
is
certainly
worth
that
said
the
vendor
smiling
and
looking
towards
isaiah
fomitch
with
a
wink
a
silver
rouble
no
but
i
will
give
you
seven
kopecks
these
were
the
first
words
pronounced
by
isaiah
fomitch
in
the
convict
prison
a
loud
laugh
was
heard
from
all
sides
seven
kopecks
well
give
them
to
me
you
are
lucky
you
are
indeed
look
take
care
of
the
pledge
you
answer
for
it
with
your
head
with
three
kopecks
for
interest
that
will
make
ten
kopecks
you
will
owe
me
said
the
jew
at
the
same
time
slipping
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
get
out
the
sum
agreed
upon
three
kopecks
interest
for
a
year
no
not
for
a
year
for
a
month
you
are
a
terrible
screw
what
is
your
name
isaiah
fomitch
well
isaiah
fomitch
you
ought
to
get
on
the
jew
examined
once
more
the
rags
on
which
he
had
lent
seven
kopecks
folded
them
up
and
put
them
carefully
away
in
his
bag
the
convicts
continued
to
laugh
at
him
in
reality
every
one
laughed
at
him
but
although
every
prisoner
owed
him
money
no
one
insulted
him
and
when
he
saw
that
every
one
was
well
disposed
towards
him
he
gave
himself
haughty
airs
but
so
comic
that
they
were
at
once
forgiven
luka
who
had
known
many
jews
when
he
was
at
liberty
often
teased
him
less
from
malice
than
for
amusement
as
one
plays
with
a
dog
or
a
parrot
isaiah
fomitch
knew
this
and
did
not
take
offence
you
will
see
jew
how
i
will
flog
you
if
you
give
me
one
blow
i
will
return
you
ten
replied
isaiah
fomitch
valiantly
scurvy
jew
as
scurvy
as
you
like
i
have
in
any
case
plenty
of
money
bravo
isaiah
fomitch
we
must
take
care
of
you
you
are
the
only
jew
we
have
but
they
will
send
you
to
siberia
all
the
same
i
am
already
in
siberia
they
will
send
you
farther
on
is
not
the
lord
god
there
of
course
he
is
everywhere
well
then
with
the
lord
god
and
money
one
has
all
that
is
necessary
what
a
fellow
he
is
cries
every
one
around
him
the
jew
sees
that
he
is
being
laughed
at
but
does
not
lose
courage
he
gives
himself
airs
the
flattery
addressed
to
him
causes
him
much
pleasure
and
with
a
high
squealing
falsetto
which
is
heard
throughout
the
barracks
he
begins
to
sing
la
la
la
la
to
an
idiotic
and
ridiculous
tune
the
only
song
he
was
heard
to
sing
during
his
stay
at
the
convict
prison
when
he
made
my
acquaintance
he
assured
me
solemnly
that
it
was
the
song
and
the
very
air
that
was
sung
by
jews
small
and
great
when
they
crossed
the
red
sea
and
that
every
israelite
was
ordered
to
sing
it
after
a
victory
gained
over
an
enemy
the
eve
of
each
saturday
the
convicts
came
from
the
other
barracks
to
ours
expressly
to
see
isaiah
fomitch
celebrating
his
sabbath
he
was
so
vain
so
innocently
conceited
that
this
general
curiosity
flattered
him
immensely
he
covered
the
table
in
his
little
corner
with
a
pedantic
air
of
importance
opened
a
book
lighted
two
candles
muttered
some
mysterious
words
and
clothed
himself
in
a
kind
of
chasuble
striped
and
with
sleeves
which
he
preserved
carefully
at
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
he
fastened
to
his
hands
leather
bracelets
and
finally
attached
to
his
forehead
by
means
of
a
ribbon
a
little
box
which
made
it
seem
as
if
a
horn
were
starting
from
his
head
he
then
began
to
pray
he
read
in
a
drawling
voice
cried
out
spat
and
threw
himself
about
with
wild
and
comic
gestures
all
this
was
prescribed
by
the
ceremonies
of
his
religion
there
was
nothing
laughable
or
strange
in
it
except
the
airs
which
isaiah
fomitch
gave
himself
before
us
in
performing
his
ceremonies
then
he
suddenly
covered
his
head
with
both
hands
and
began
to
read
with
many
sobs
his
tears
increased
and
in
his
grief
he
almost
lay
down
upon
the
book
his
head
with
the
ark
upon
it
howling
as
he
did
so
but
suddenly
in
the
midst
of
his
despondent
sobs
he
burst
into
a
laugh
and
recited
with
a
nasal
twang
a
hymn
of
triumph
as
if
he
were
overcome
by
an
excess
of
happiness
impossible
to
understand
it
the
convicts
would
sometimes
say
to
one
another
one
day
i
asked
isaiah
fomitch
what
these
sobs
signified
and
why
he
passed
so
suddenly
from
despair
to
triumphant
happiness
isaiah
fomitch
was
very
pleased
when
i
asked
him
these
questions
he
explained
to
me
directly
that
the
sobs
and
tears
were
provoked
by
the
loss
of
jerusalem
and
that
the
law
ordered
the
pious
jew
to
groan
and
strike
his
breast
but
at
the
moment
of
his
most
acute
grief
he
was
suddenly
to
remember
that
a
prophecy
had
foretold
the
return
of
the
jews
to
jerusalem
and
he
was
then
to
manifest
overflowing
joy
to
sing
to
laugh
and
to
recite
his
prayers
with
an
expression
of
happiness
in
his
voice
and
on
his
countenance
this
sudden
passage
from
one
phase
of
feeling
to
another
delighted
isaiah
fomitch
and
he
explained
to
me
this
ingenious
prescription
of
his
faith
with
the
greatest
satisfaction
one
evening
in
the
midst
of
his
prayers
the
major
entered
followed
by
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
an
escort
of
soldiers
all
the
prisoners
got
immediately
into
line
before
their
isaiah
fomitch
alone
continued
to
shriek
and
gesticulate
he
knew
that
his
worship
was
authorised
and
that
no
one
could
interrupt
him
so
that
in
howling
in
the
presence
of
the
major
he
ran
no
risk
it
pleased
him
to
throw
himself
about
beneath
the
eyes
of
the
chief
the
major
approached
within
a
few
steps
isaiah
fomitch
turned
his
back
to
the
table
and
just
in
front
of
the
officer
began
to
sing
his
hymn
of
triumph
gesticulating
and
drawling
out
certain
syllables
when
he
came
to
the
part
where
he
had
to
assume
an
expression
of
extreme
happiness
he
did
so
by
blinking
with
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
laughing
and
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
major
the
latter
was
at
first
much
astonished
then
he
burst
into
a
laugh
called
out
idiot
and
went
away
while
the
jew
still
continued
to
shriek
an
hour
later
when
he
had
finished
i
asked
him
what
he
would
have
done
if
the
major
had
been
wicked
enough
and
foolish
enough
to
lose
his
temper
what
major
what
major
did
you
not
see
him
he
was
only
two
steps
from
you
and
was
looking
at
you
all
the
time
but
isaiah
fomitch
assured
me
as
seriously
as
possible
that
he
had
not
seen
the
major
for
while
he
was
saying
his
prayers
he
was
in
such
a
state
of
ecstasy
that
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
anything
that
was
taking
place
around
him
i
can
see
isaiah
fomitch
wandering
about
on
saturday
throughout
the
prison
endeavouring
to
do
nothing
as
the
law
prescribes
to
every
jew
what
improbable
anecdotes
he
told
me
every
time
he
returned
from
the
synagogue
he
always
brought
me
some
news
of
petersburg
and
the
most
absurd
rumours
imaginable
from
his
fellow
jews
of
the
town
who
themselves
had
received
them
at
first
hand
but
i
have
already
spoken
too
much
of
isaiah
fomitch
in
the
whole
town
there
were
only
two
public
baths
the
first
kept
by
a
jew
was
divided
into
compartments
for
which
one
paid
fifty
kopecks
it
was
frequented
by
the
aristocracy
of
the
town
the
other
bath
old
dirty
and
close
was
destined
for
the
people
it
was
there
that
the
convicts
were
taken
the
air
was
cold
and
clear
the
prisoners
were
delighted
to
get
out
of
the
fortress
and
have
a
walk
through
the
town
during
the
walk
their
laughter
and
jokes
never
ceased
a
platoon
of
soldiers
with
muskets
loaded
accompanied
us
it
was
quite
a
sight
for
the
when
we
had
reached
our
destination
the
bath
was
so
small
that
it
did
not
permit
us
all
to
enter
at
once
we
were
divided
into
two
bands
one
of
which
waited
in
the
cold
room
while
the
other
one
bathed
in
the
hot
one
even
then
so
narrow
was
the
room
that
it
was
difficult
for
us
to
understand
how
half
of
the
convicts
could
stand
together
in
it
petroff
kept
close
to
me
he
remained
by
my
side
without
my
having
begged
him
to
do
so
and
offered
to
rub
me
down
baklouchin
a
convict
of
the
special
section
offered
me
at
the
same
time
his
services
i
recollect
this
prisoner
who
was
called
the
sapper
as
the
gayest
and
most
agreeable
of
all
my
companions
we
had
become
intimate
friends
petroff
helped
me
to
undress
because
i
was
generally
a
long
time
getting
my
things
off
not
being
yet
accustomed
to
the
operation
and
it
was
almost
as
cold
in
the
as
outside
the
doors
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
convict
who
is
still
a
novice
to
get
his
things
off
for
he
must
know
how
to
undo
the
leather
straps
which
fasten
on
the
chains
these
leather
straps
are
buckled
over
the
shirt
just
beneath
the
ring
which
encloses
the
leg
one
pair
of
straps
costs
sixty
kopecks
and
each
convict
is
obliged
to
get
himself
a
pair
for
it
would
be
impossible
to
walk
without
their
assistance
the
ring
does
not
enclose
the
leg
too
tightly
one
can
pass
the
finger
between
the
iron
and
the
flesh
but
the
ring
rubs
against
the
calf
so
that
in
a
single
day
the
convict
who
walks
without
leather
straps
gets
his
skin
broken
to
take
off
the
straps
presents
no
difficulty
it
is
not
the
same
with
the
clothes
to
get
the
trousers
off
is
in
itself
a
prodigious
operation
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
shirt
whenever
it
has
to
be
changed
the
first
who
gave
us
lessons
in
this
art
was
koreneff
a
former
chief
of
brigands
condemned
to
be
chained
up
for
five
years
the
convicts
are
very
skilful
at
the
work
and
do
it
readily
i
gave
a
few
kopecks
to
petroff
to
buy
soap
and
a
bunch
of
the
twigs
with
which
one
rubs
oneself
in
the
bath
bits
of
soap
were
given
to
the
convicts
but
they
were
not
larger
than
pieces
of
two
kopecks
the
soap
was
sold
in
the
as
well
as
mead
cakes
of
white
flour
and
boiling
water
for
each
convict
received
but
one
pailful
according
to
the
agreement
made
between
the
proprietor
of
the
bath
and
the
administration
of
the
prison
the
convicts
who
wished
to
make
themselves
thoroughly
clean
could
for
two
kopecks
buy
another
pailful
which
the
proprietor
handed
to
them
through
a
window
pierced
in
the
wall
for
that
purpose
as
soon
as
i
was
undressed
petroff
took
me
by
the
arm
and
observed
to
me
that
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
walk
with
my
chains
drag
them
up
on
to
your
calves
he
said
to
me
holding
me
by
the
arms
at
the
same
time
as
if
i
were
an
old
man
i
was
ashamed
at
his
care
and
assured
him
that
i
could
walk
well
enough
by
myself
but
he
did
not
believe
me
he
paid
me
the
same
attention
that
one
gives
to
an
awkward
child
petroff
was
not
a
servant
in
any
sense
of
the
word
if
i
had
offended
him
he
would
have
known
how
to
deal
with
me
i
had
promised
him
nothing
for
his
assistance
nor
had
he
asked
me
for
anything
what
inspired
him
with
so
much
solicitude
for
me
represent
to
yourself
a
room
of
twelve
feet
long
by
as
many
broad
in
which
a
hundred
men
are
all
crowded
together
or
at
least
eighty
for
we
were
in
all
two
hundred
divided
into
two
sections
the
steam
blinded
us
the
sweat
the
dirt
the
want
of
space
were
such
that
we
did
not
know
where
to
put
a
foot
down
i
was
frightened
and
wished
to
go
out
petroff
hastened
to
reassure
me
with
great
trouble
we
succeeded
in
raising
ourselves
on
to
the
benches
by
passing
over
the
heads
of
the
convicts
whom
we
begged
to
bend
down
in
order
to
let
us
pass
but
all
the
benches
were
already
occupied
petroff
informed
me
that
i
must
buy
a
place
and
at
once
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
convict
who
was
near
the
window
for
a
kopeck
this
man
consented
to
cede
me
his
place
after
receiving
the
money
which
petroff
held
tight
in
his
hand
and
which
he
had
prudently
provided
himself
with
beforehand
the
man
crept
just
beneath
me
into
a
dark
and
dirty
corner
there
was
there
at
least
half
an
inch
of
filth
even
the
places
above
the
benches
were
occupied
the
convicts
swarmed
everywhere
as
for
the
floor
there
was
not
a
place
as
big
as
the
palm
of
the
hand
which
was
not
occupied
by
the
convicts
they
sent
the
water
in
spouts
out
of
their
pails
those
who
were
standing
up
washed
themselves
pail
in
hand
and
the
dirty
water
ran
all
down
their
body
to
fall
on
the
shaved
heads
of
those
who
were
sitting
down
on
the
upper
bench
and
the
steps
which
led
to
it
were
heaped
together
other
convicts
who
washed
themselves
more
thoroughly
but
these
were
in
small
number
the
populace
does
not
care
to
wash
with
soap
and
water
it
prefers
stewing
in
a
horrible
manner
and
then
inundating
itself
with
cold
water
that
is
how
the
common
people
take
their
bath
on
the
floor
could
be
seen
fifty
bundles
of
rods
rising
and
falling
at
the
same
time
the
holders
were
whipping
themselves
into
a
state
of
intoxication
the
steam
became
thicker
and
thicker
every
minute
so
that
what
one
now
felt
was
not
a
warm
but
a
burning
sensation
as
from
boiling
pitch
the
convicts
shouted
and
howled
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
hundred
chains
shaking
on
the
floor
those
who
wished
to
pass
from
one
place
to
another
got
their
chains
mixed
up
with
those
of
their
neighbours
and
knocked
against
the
heads
of
the
men
who
were
lower
down
than
they
then
there
were
volleys
of
oaths
as
those
who
fell
dragged
down
the
ones
whose
chains
had
become
entangled
in
theirs
they
were
all
in
a
state
of
intoxication
of
wild
exultation
cries
and
shrieks
were
heard
on
all
sides
there
was
much
crowding
and
crushing
at
the
window
of
the
through
which
the
hot
water
was
delivered
and
much
of
it
got
spilt
over
the
heads
of
those
who
were
seated
on
the
floor
before
it
arrived
at
its
destination
we
seemed
to
be
fully
at
liberty
and
yet
from
time
to
time
behind
the
window
of
the
or
through
the
open
door
could
be
seen
the
moustached
face
of
a
soldier
with
his
musket
at
his
feet
watching
that
no
serious
disorder
took
place
the
shaved
heads
of
the
convicts
and
their
red
bodies
which
the
steam
made
the
colour
of
blood
seemed
more
monstrous
than
ever
on
their
backs
made
scarlet
by
the
steam
stood
out
in
striking
relief
the
scars
left
by
the
whips
and
the
rods
made
long
before
but
so
thoroughly
that
the
flesh
seemed
to
have
been
quite
recently
torn
strange
scars
a
shudder
passed
through
me
at
the
mere
sight
of
them
again
the
volume
of
steam
increased
and
the
was
now
covered
with
a
thick
burning
cloud
covering
agitation
and
cries
from
this
cloud
stood
out
torn
backs
shaved
heads
and
to
complete
the
picture
isaiah
fomitch
howling
with
joy
on
the
highest
of
the
benches
he
was
saturating
himself
with
steam
any
other
man
would
have
fainted
away
but
no
temperature
is
too
high
for
him
he
engages
the
services
of
a
rubber
for
a
kopeck
but
after
a
few
moments
the
latter
is
unable
to
continue
throws
away
his
bunch
of
twigs
and
runs
to
inundate
himself
with
cold
water
isaiah
fomitch
does
not
lose
courage
he
runs
to
hire
a
second
rubber
then
a
third
on
these
occasions
he
thinks
nothing
of
expense
and
changes
his
rubber
four
or
five
times
he
stews
well
the
gallant
isaiah
fomitch
cry
the
convicts
from
below
the
jew
feels
that
he
goes
beyond
all
the
others
he
has
beaten
them
he
triumphs
with
his
hoarse
falsetto
voice
and
sings
out
his
favourite
air
which
rises
above
the
general
hubbub
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
ever
we
met
in
hell
we
should
be
reminded
of
the
place
where
we
then
were
i
could
not
resist
a
wish
to
communicate
this
idea
to
petroff
he
looked
all
round
him
but
made
no
answer
i
wished
to
buy
a
place
for
him
on
the
bench
by
my
side
but
he
sat
down
at
my
feet
and
declared
that
he
felt
quite
at
his
ease
baklouchin
meanwhile
bought
us
some
hot
water
which
he
would
bring
to
us
as
soon
as
we
wanted
it
petroff
offered
to
clean
me
from
head
to
foot
and
he
begged
me
to
go
through
the
preliminary
stewing
process
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
it
at
last
he
rubbed
me
all
over
with
soap
i
wished
to
make
him
understand
that
i
could
wash
myself
but
it
was
no
use
contradicting
him
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
him
when
he
had
done
with
me
he
took
me
back
to
the
holding
me
up
and
telling
me
at
each
step
to
take
care
as
if
i
had
been
made
of
porcelain
he
helped
me
to
put
on
my
clothes
and
when
he
had
finished
his
kindly
work
he
rushed
back
to
the
bath
to
have
a
thorough
stewing
when
we
got
back
to
the
barracks
i
offered
him
a
glass
of
tea
which
he
did
not
refuse
he
drank
it
and
thanked
me
i
wished
to
go
to
the
expense
of
a
glass
of
vodka
in
his
honour
and
i
succeeded
in
getting
it
on
the
spot
petroff
was
exceedingly
pleased
he
swallowed
his
vodka
with
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
declared
that
i
had
restored
him
to
life
and
then
suddenly
rushed
to
the
kitchen
as
if
the
people
who
were
talking
there
could
not
decide
anything
important
without
him
now
another
man
came
up
for
a
talk
this
was
baklouchin
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
and
whom
i
had
also
invited
to
take
tea
i
never
knew
a
man
of
a
more
agreeable
disposition
than
baklouchin
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
never
forgave
a
wrong
and
that
he
often
got
into
quarrels
he
could
not
above
all
endure
people
interfering
with
his
affairs
he
knew
in
a
word
how
to
take
care
of
himself
but
his
quarrels
never
lasted
long
and
i
believe
that
all
the
convicts
liked
him
wherever
he
went
he
was
well
received
even
in
the
town
he
was
looked
upon
as
the
most
amusing
man
in
the
world
he
was
a
man
of
lofty
stature
thirty
years
old
with
a
frank
determined
countenance
and
rather
with
his
tuft
of
hair
on
his
chin
he
possessed
the
art
of
changing
his
face
in
such
a
comic
manner
by
imitating
the
first
person
he
happened
to
see
that
the
people
around
him
were
constantly
in
a
roar
he
was
a
professed
joker
but
he
never
allowed
himself
to
be
slighted
by
those
who
did
not
enjoy
his
fun
accordingly
no
one
spoke
disparagingly
of
him
he
was
full
of
life
and
fire
he
made
my
acquaintance
at
the
very
beginning
of
my
imprisonment
and
related
to
me
his
military
career
when
he
was
a
sapper
in
the
engineers
where
he
had
been
placed
as
a
favour
by
people
of
influence
he
put
a
number
of
questions
to
me
about
petersburg
he
even
read
books
when
he
came
to
take
tea
with
me
he
amused
the
whole
company
by
relating
how
roughly
lieutenant
k
had
that
morning
handled
the
major
he
told
me
moreover
with
a
satisfied
air
as
he
took
his
seat
by
my
side
that
we
should
probably
have
a
theatrical
representation
in
the
prison
the
convicts
proposed
to
get
up
a
play
during
the
christmas
holidays
the
necessary
actors
were
found
and
little
by
little
the
scenery
was
prepared
some
persons
in
the
town
had
promised
to
lend
women
clothes
for
the
performance
some
hopes
were
even
entertained
of
obtaining
through
the
medium
of
an
officer
servant
a
uniform
with
epaulettes
provided
only
the
major
did
not
take
it
into
his
head
to
forbid
the
performance
as
he
had
done
the
previous
year
he
was
at
that
time
in
through
having
lost
at
cards
and
he
had
been
annoyed
at
something
that
had
taken
place
in
the
prison
accordingly
in
a
fit
of
he
had
forbidden
the
performance
it
was
possible
however
that
this
year
he
would
not
prevent
it
baklouchin
was
in
a
state
of
exultation
it
could
be
seen
that
he
would
be
one
of
the
principal
supporters
of
the
meditated
theatre
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
present
at
the
performance
the
ingenuous
joy
which
baklouchin
manifested
in
speaking
of
the
undertaking
was
quite
touching
from
whispering
we
gradually
got
to
talk
of
the
matter
quite
openly
he
told
me
among
other
things
that
he
had
not
served
at
petersburg
alone
he
had
been
sent
to
r
with
the
rank
of
officer
in
a
garrison
battalion
from
there
they
sent
me
on
here
added
baklouchin
and
why
i
asked
him
why
you
would
never
guess
alexander
petrovitch
because
i
was
in
love
come
now
a
man
is
not
exiled
for
that
i
said
with
a
laugh
i
should
have
added
continued
baklouchin
that
it
made
me
kill
a
german
with
a
was
it
worth
while
to
send
me
to
hard
labour
for
killing
a
german
only
think
how
did
it
happen
tell
me
the
story
it
must
be
a
strange
one
an
amusing
story
indeed
alexander
petrovitch
so
much
the
better
tell
me
you
wish
me
to
do
so
well
then
listen
and
he
told
me
the
story
of
his
murder
it
was
not
amusing
but
it
was
indeed
strange
this
is
how
it
happened
began
baklouchin
i
had
been
sent
to
riga
a
fine
handsome
city
which
has
only
one
fault
there
are
too
many
germans
there
i
was
still
a
young
man
and
i
had
a
good
character
with
my
officers
i
wore
my
cap
cocked
on
the
side
of
my
head
and
passed
my
time
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
i
made
love
to
the
german
girls
one
of
them
named
luisa
pleased
me
very
much
she
and
her
aunt
were
of
fine
linen
the
old
woman
was
a
true
caricature
but
she
had
money
first
of
all
i
merely
passed
under
the
young
girl
windows
but
i
soon
made
her
acquaintance
luisa
spoke
russian
well
enough
though
with
a
slight
accent
she
was
charming
i
never
saw
any
one
like
her
i
was
most
pressing
in
my
advances
but
she
only
replied
that
she
would
preserve
her
innocence
that
as
a
wife
she
might
prove
worthy
of
me
she
was
an
affectionate
smiling
girl
and
wonderfully
neat
in
fact
i
assure
you
i
never
saw
any
one
like
her
she
herself
had
suggested
that
i
should
marry
her
and
how
was
i
not
to
marry
her
suddenly
luisa
did
not
come
to
her
appointment
this
happened
once
then
twice
then
a
third
time
i
sent
her
a
letter
but
she
did
not
reply
is
to
be
done
i
said
to
myself
if
she
had
been
deceiving
me
she
could
easily
have
taken
me
in
she
could
have
answered
my
letter
and
come
all
the
same
to
the
appointment
but
she
was
incapable
of
falsehood
she
had
simply
broken
off
with
me
is
a
trick
of
the
aunt
i
said
to
myself
i
was
afraid
to
go
to
her
house
even
though
she
was
aware
of
our
engagement
we
acted
as
if
she
were
ignorant
of
it
i
wrote
a
fine
letter
in
which
i
said
to
luisa
you
do
come
i
will
come
to
your
aunt
for
you
she
was
afraid
and
came
then
she
began
to
weep
and
told
me
that
a
german
named
schultz
a
distant
relation
of
theirs
a
clockmaker
by
trade
and
of
a
certain
age
but
rich
had
shown
a
wish
to
marry
her
in
order
to
make
her
happy
as
he
said
and
that
he
himself
might
not
remain
without
a
wife
in
his
old
age
he
had
loved
her
a
long
time
so
she
told
me
and
had
been
nourishing
this
idea
for
years
but
he
had
kept
it
a
secret
and
had
never
ventured
to
speak
out
see
sasha
she
said
to
me
it
is
a
question
of
my
happiness
for
he
is
rich
and
would
you
prevent
my
happiness
i
looked
her
in
the
face
she
wept
embraced
me
clasped
me
in
her
arms
she
is
quite
right
i
said
to
myself
good
is
there
in
marrying
a
soldier
even
a
officer
come
farewell
luisa
god
protect
you
i
have
no
right
to
prevent
your
happiness
what
sort
of
a
man
is
he
is
he
he
is
old
and
he
has
such
a
long
nose
she
here
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
i
left
her
was
my
destiny
i
said
to
myself
the
next
day
i
passed
by
schultz
shop
she
had
told
me
where
he
lived
i
looked
through
the
window
and
saw
a
german
who
was
arranging
a
watch
years
of
age
an
aquiline
nose
swollen
eyes
a
with
a
very
high
collar
i
spat
with
contempt
as
i
looked
at
him
at
that
moment
i
was
ready
to
break
the
shop
windows
but
is
the
use
of
it
i
said
to
myself
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
it
is
over
all
over
i
got
back
to
the
barracks
as
the
night
was
falling
and
stretched
myself
out
on
my
bed
and
will
you
believe
it
alexander
petrovitch
began
to
sob
yes
to
sob
one
day
passed
then
a
second
then
a
third
i
saw
luisa
no
more
i
had
learned
however
from
an
old
woman
she
was
also
a
washerwoman
and
the
girl
i
loved
used
sometimes
to
visit
her
that
this
german
knew
of
our
relations
and
that
for
that
reason
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
marry
her
as
soon
as
possible
otherwise
he
would
have
waited
two
years
longer
he
had
made
luisa
swear
that
she
would
see
me
no
more
it
appeared
that
on
account
of
me
he
had
refused
to
loosen
his
and
kept
luisa
and
her
aunt
very
close
perhaps
he
would
yet
change
his
idea
for
he
was
not
very
resolute
the
old
woman
told
me
that
he
had
invited
them
to
take
coffee
with
him
the
next
day
a
sunday
and
that
another
relation
a
former
shopkeeper
now
very
poor
and
an
assistant
in
some
liquor
store
would
also
come
when
i
found
that
the
business
was
to
be
settled
on
sunday
i
was
so
furious
that
i
could
not
recover
my
cold
blood
and
the
following
day
i
did
nothing
but
reflect
i
believe
i
could
have
devoured
that
german
on
sunday
morning
i
had
not
come
to
any
decision
as
soon
as
the
service
was
over
i
ran
out
got
into
my
and
went
to
the
house
of
this
german
i
thought
i
should
find
them
all
there
why
i
went
to
the
german
and
what
i
meant
to
say
to
him
i
did
not
know
myself
i
slipped
a
pistol
into
my
pocket
to
be
ready
for
everything
a
little
pistol
which
was
not
worth
a
curse
with
an
lock
a
thing
i
had
used
when
i
was
a
boy
and
which
was
really
fit
for
nothing
i
loaded
it
however
because
i
thought
they
would
try
to
kick
me
out
and
that
the
german
would
insult
me
in
which
case
i
would
pull
out
my
pistol
to
frighten
them
all
i
arrived
there
was
no
one
on
the
staircase
they
were
all
in
the
no
servant
the
one
girl
who
waited
upon
them
was
absent
i
crossed
the
shop
and
saw
that
the
door
was
closed
an
old
door
fastened
from
the
inside
my
heart
beat
i
stopped
and
listened
they
were
speaking
german
i
broke
open
the
door
with
a
kick
i
looked
round
the
table
was
laid
there
was
a
large
on
it
with
a
spirit
lamp
underneath
and
a
plate
of
biscuits
on
a
tray
there
was
a
small
decanter
of
brandy
herrings
sausages
and
a
bottle
of
some
wine
luisa
and
her
aunt
both
in
their
sunday
best
were
seated
on
a
sofa
opposite
them
the
german
was
exhibiting
himself
on
a
chair
got
up
like
a
bridegroom
and
in
his
coat
with
the
high
collar
and
with
his
hair
carefully
combed
on
the
other
side
there
was
another
german
old
fat
and
gray
he
was
taking
no
part
in
the
conversation
when
i
entered
luisa
turned
very
pale
the
aunt
sprang
up
with
a
bound
and
sat
down
again
the
german
became
angry
what
a
rage
he
was
in
he
got
up
and
walking
towards
me
said
do
you
want
i
should
have
lost
my
if
anger
had
not
supported
me
do
i
want
is
this
the
way
to
receive
a
guest
why
do
you
not
offer
him
something
to
drink
i
have
come
to
pay
you
a
visit
the
german
reflected
a
moment
and
then
said
down
i
sat
down
is
some
vodka
help
yourself
i
beg
let
it
be
good
i
cried
getting
more
and
more
into
a
rage
is
good
i
was
enraged
to
see
him
looking
at
me
from
top
to
toe
the
most
frightful
part
of
it
was
that
luisa
was
looking
on
i
took
a
drink
and
said
to
him
here
german
what
business
have
you
to
speak
rudely
to
me
let
us
be
better
acquainted
i
have
come
to
see
you
as
friends
can
not
be
your
friend
he
replied
are
a
private
soldier
then
i
lost
all
you
german
you
you
know
how
much
you
are
in
my
power
look
here
do
you
wish
me
to
break
your
head
with
this
pistol
i
drew
out
my
pistol
got
up
and
struck
him
on
the
forehead
the
women
were
more
dead
than
alive
they
were
afraid
to
breathe
the
eldest
of
the
two
men
quite
white
was
trembling
like
a
leaf
the
german
seemed
much
astonished
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
am
not
afraid
of
you
he
said
i
beg
of
you
as
a
man
to
put
an
end
to
this
pleasantry
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
are
afraid
you
dare
not
move
while
this
pistol
is
presented
at
you
dare
not
do
such
a
thing
he
cried
why
should
i
not
dare
you
would
be
severely
punished
may
the
devil
take
that
idiot
of
a
german
if
he
had
not
urged
me
on
he
would
have
been
alive
now
you
think
i
dare
not
dare
not
you
think
would
not
dare
i
i
fired
the
pistol
and
down
he
sank
on
his
chair
the
others
uttered
shrieks
i
put
back
my
pistol
in
my
pocket
and
when
i
returned
to
the
fortress
threw
it
among
some
weeds
near
the
principal
entrance
inside
the
barracks
i
laid
on
my
bed
and
said
to
myself
shall
be
taken
away
soon
one
hour
passed
then
another
but
i
was
not
arrested
towards
evening
i
felt
so
sad
i
went
out
at
all
hazards
to
see
luisa
i
passed
before
the
house
of
the
clockmaker
there
were
a
number
of
people
there
including
the
police
i
ran
on
to
the
old
woman
and
said
luisa
i
had
only
a
moment
to
wait
she
came
immediately
and
threw
herself
on
my
neck
in
tears
is
my
fault
she
said
should
not
have
listened
to
my
aunt
she
then
told
me
that
her
aunt
immediately
after
the
scene
had
gone
back
home
she
was
in
such
a
fright
that
she
fell
and
did
not
speak
a
word
she
had
uttered
nothing
on
the
contrary
she
ordered
her
niece
to
be
as
silent
as
herself
one
has
seen
her
since
said
luisa
the
clockmaker
had
previously
sent
his
servant
away
for
he
was
afraid
of
her
she
was
jealous
and
would
have
scratched
his
eyes
out
had
she
known
that
he
wished
to
get
married
there
were
no
workmen
in
the
house
he
had
sent
them
all
away
he
had
himself
prepared
the
coffee
and
collation
as
for
the
relation
who
had
scarcely
spoken
a
word
all
his
life
he
took
his
hat
and
without
opening
his
mouth
went
away
is
quite
sure
to
be
silent
added
luisa
so
indeed
he
was
for
two
weeks
no
one
arrested
me
nor
suspected
me
the
least
in
the
world
you
need
not
believe
me
unless
you
choose
alexander
petrovitch
these
two
weeks
were
the
happiest
in
my
life
i
saw
luisa
every
day
and
how
much
she
had
become
attached
to
me
she
said
to
me
through
her
tears
you
are
exiled
i
will
go
with
you
i
will
leave
everything
to
follow
you
i
thought
of
making
away
with
myself
so
much
had
she
moved
me
but
after
two
weeks
i
was
arrested
the
old
man
and
the
aunt
had
agreed
to
denounce
me
but
i
interrupted
baklouchin
for
that
they
would
only
have
given
you
from
ten
to
twelve
years
hard
labour
and
in
the
civil
section
yet
you
are
in
the
special
section
how
does
that
happen
that
is
another
affair
said
baklouchin
when
i
was
taken
before
the
council
of
war
the
captain
appointed
to
conduct
the
case
began
by
insulting
me
and
calling
me
names
before
the
tribunal
i
could
not
stand
it
and
shouted
out
to
him
do
you
insult
me
do
you
see
you
scoundrel
that
you
are
only
looking
at
yourself
in
the
glass
this
brought
a
new
charge
against
me
i
was
tried
a
second
time
and
for
the
two
things
was
condemned
to
four
thousand
strokes
and
to
the
special
section
when
i
was
taken
out
to
receive
my
punishment
in
the
the
captain
was
at
the
same
time
sent
away
he
had
been
degraded
from
his
rank
and
was
despatched
to
the
caucasus
as
a
private
soldier
alexander
petrovitch
do
fail
to
come
to
our
performance
chapter
xi
the
christmas
holidays
the
holidays
were
approaching
on
the
eve
of
the
great
day
the
convicts
scarcely
ever
went
to
work
those
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
sewing
workshops
and
a
few
others
went
to
work
as
usual
but
they
went
back
almost
immediately
to
the
convict
prison
separately
or
in
parties
after
dinner
no
one
worked
from
the
early
morning
the
greater
part
of
the
convicts
were
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
and
not
with
those
of
the
administration
some
were
making
arrangements
for
bringing
in
spirits
while
others
were
seeking
permission
to
see
their
friends
or
to
collect
small
accounts
due
to
them
for
the
work
they
had
already
executed
baklouchin
and
the
convicts
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
performance
were
endeavouring
to
persuade
some
of
their
acquaintances
nearly
all
officers
servants
to
procure
for
them
the
necessary
costumes
some
of
them
came
and
went
with
a
air
solely
because
others
were
really
occupied
they
had
no
money
to
receive
and
yet
seemed
to
expect
a
payment
every
one
in
short
seemed
to
be
looking
for
a
change
of
some
kind
towards
evening
the
old
soldiers
who
executed
the
convicts
commissions
brought
them
all
kinds
of
victuals
meat
and
geese
many
prisoners
even
the
most
simple
and
most
economical
after
saving
up
their
kopecks
throughout
the
year
thought
they
ought
to
spend
some
of
them
that
day
so
as
to
celebrate
christmas
eve
in
a
worthy
manner
the
day
afterwards
was
for
the
convicts
a
still
greater
festival
one
to
which
they
had
a
right
as
it
was
recognised
by
law
the
prisoners
could
not
be
sent
to
work
that
day
there
were
not
three
days
like
it
in
all
the
year
and
moreover
what
recollections
must
have
been
agitating
the
souls
of
those
reprobates
at
the
approach
of
such
a
solemn
day
the
common
people
from
their
childhood
kept
the
great
festival
in
their
memory
they
must
have
remembered
with
anguish
and
torments
these
days
which
work
being
laid
aside
are
passed
in
the
bosom
of
the
family
the
respect
of
the
convicts
for
that
day
had
something
imposing
about
it
the
drunkards
were
not
at
all
numerous
nearly
every
one
was
serious
and
so
to
say
preoccupied
though
they
had
for
the
most
part
nothing
to
do
even
those
who
feasted
most
preserved
a
serious
air
laughter
seemed
to
be
forbidden
a
sort
of
intolerant
susceptibility
reigned
throughout
the
prison
and
if
any
one
interfered
with
the
general
repose
even
involuntarily
he
was
soon
put
in
his
proper
place
with
cries
and
oaths
he
was
condemned
as
though
he
had
been
wanting
in
respect
to
the
festival
itself
this
disposition
of
the
convicts
was
remarkable
and
even
touching
besides
the
innate
veneration
they
have
for
this
great
day
they
foresee
that
in
observing
the
festival
they
are
in
communion
with
the
rest
of
the
world
that
they
are
not
altogether
reprobates
lost
and
cast
off
by
society
the
usual
rejoicings
took
place
in
the
convict
prison
as
well
as
outside
they
felt
all
that
i
saw
it
and
understood
it
myself
akim
akimitch
had
made
great
preparations
for
the
festival
he
had
no
family
recollections
being
an
orphan
born
in
a
strange
house
and
put
into
the
army
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
could
never
have
experienced
any
great
joys
having
always
lived
regularly
and
uniformly
in
the
fear
of
infringing
the
rules
imposed
upon
him
nor
was
he
very
religious
for
his
acquired
formality
had
stifled
in
him
all
human
feeling
all
passions
and
likings
good
or
bad
he
accordingly
prepared
to
keep
christmas
without
exciting
himself
about
it
he
was
saddened
by
no
painful
useless
recollection
he
did
everything
with
the
punctuality
imposed
upon
him
in
the
execution
of
his
duties
and
in
order
once
for
all
to
get
through
the
ceremony
in
a
becoming
manner
moreover
he
did
not
care
to
reflect
upon
the
importance
of
the
day
had
never
troubled
his
brain
about
it
even
while
he
was
executing
his
prescribed
duties
with
religious
minuteness
if
he
had
been
ordered
the
day
following
to
do
contrary
to
what
he
had
done
the
evening
before
he
would
have
done
it
with
equal
submission
once
in
life
once
and
once
only
he
had
wished
to
act
by
his
own
impulse
and
he
had
been
sent
to
hard
labour
for
it
this
lesson
had
not
been
lost
upon
him
although
it
was
written
that
he
was
never
to
understand
his
fault
he
had
yet
become
impressed
with
this
salutary
moral
principle
never
to
reason
in
any
matter
because
his
mind
was
not
equal
to
the
task
of
judging
blindly
devoted
to
ceremonies
he
looked
with
respect
at
the
which
he
had
stuffed
with
and
which
he
had
roasted
himself
for
he
had
some
culinary
skill
just
as
if
it
had
not
been
an
ordinary
which
could
have
been
bought
and
roasted
at
any
time
but
a
particular
kind
of
animal
born
specially
for
christmas
day
perhaps
he
had
been
accustomed
from
his
tender
infancy
to
see
that
day
a
on
the
table
and
he
may
have
concluded
that
a
was
indispensable
for
the
proper
celebration
of
the
festival
i
am
certain
that
if
by
he
had
not
eaten
this
particular
kind
of
meat
on
that
day
he
would
have
been
troubled
with
remorse
all
his
life
for
not
having
done
his
duty
until
christmas
morning
he
wore
his
old
vest
and
his
old
trousers
which
had
long
been
threadbare
i
then
learned
that
he
kept
carefully
in
his
box
his
new
clothes
which
had
been
given
to
him
four
months
before
and
that
he
had
not
put
them
on
once
in
order
that
he
might
wear
them
for
the
first
time
on
christmas
day
he
did
so
the
evening
before
he
took
his
new
clothes
out
of
his
trunk
unfolded
examined
them
cleaned
them
blew
on
them
to
remove
the
dust
and
when
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
perfect
probably
tried
them
on
the
dress
became
him
perfectly
all
the
different
garments
suited
one
another
the
waistcoat
buttoned
up
to
the
neck
the
collar
straight
and
stiff
like
cardboard
kept
his
chin
in
its
proper
place
there
was
a
military
cut
about
the
dress
and
akim
akimitch
as
he
wore
it
smiled
with
satisfaction
turning
himself
round
and
round
not
without
swagger
before
a
little
mirror
adorned
with
a
gilt
border
one
of
the
alone
seemed
out
of
place
akim
akimitch
remarked
it
and
at
once
set
it
right
he
tried
on
the
vest
again
and
found
it
irreproachable
then
he
folded
up
his
things
as
before
and
with
a
satisfied
mind
locked
them
up
in
his
box
until
the
next
day
his
skull
was
sufficiently
shaved
but
after
careful
examination
akim
akimitch
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
not
in
good
condition
his
hair
had
imperceptibly
sprung
up
he
accordingly
went
immediately
to
the
major
to
be
properly
shaved
according
to
the
rules
in
reality
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
looking
at
him
next
day
but
he
was
acting
conscientiously
in
order
to
fulfil
all
his
duties
this
care
lest
the
smallest
button
the
least
thread
of
an
epaulette
the
slightest
string
of
a
tassel
should
go
wrong
was
engraved
in
his
mind
as
an
imperious
duty
and
in
his
heart
as
the
image
of
the
most
perfect
order
that
could
possibly
be
attained
as
one
of
the
old
hands
in
the
barracks
he
saw
that
hay
was
brought
and
strewed
about
on
the
floor
the
same
thing
was
done
in
the
other
barracks
i
do
not
know
why
but
hay
was
always
strewed
on
the
ground
at
christmas
time
as
soon
as
akim
akimitch
had
finished
his
work
he
said
his
prayers
stretched
himself
on
his
bed
and
went
to
sleep
with
the
sleep
of
a
child
in
order
to
wake
up
as
early
as
possible
the
next
day
the
other
convicts
did
the
same
it
must
be
added
that
all
of
them
went
to
bed
but
sooner
than
usual
they
gave
up
their
ordinary
evening
work
that
day
as
for
playing
cards
no
one
would
have
dared
even
to
speak
of
such
a
thing
every
one
was
anxiously
expecting
the
next
morning
at
last
this
morning
arrived
at
an
early
hour
even
before
it
was
light
the
drum
was
sounded
and
the
under
officer
whose
duty
it
was
to
count
the
convicts
wished
them
a
happy
christmas
the
prisoners
answered
him
in
an
affable
and
amiable
tone
by
expressing
a
like
wish
akim
akimitch
and
many
others
who
had
their
geese
and
their
went
to
the
kitchen
after
saying
their
prayers
in
a
hurried
manner
to
see
where
their
victuals
were
and
how
they
were
being
cooked
through
the
little
windows
of
our
barracks
half
hidden
by
the
snow
and
the
ice
could
be
seen
flaring
in
the
darkness
the
bright
fire
of
the
two
kitchens
where
six
stoves
had
been
lighted
in
the
where
it
was
still
dark
the
convicts
each
with
a
half
pelisse
round
his
shoulders
or
perhaps
fully
dressed
were
hurrying
towards
the
kitchen
some
of
them
meanwhile
a
very
small
number
had
already
visited
the
they
were
the
impatient
ones
but
they
behaved
becomingly
possibly
much
better
than
on
ordinary
days
neither
quarrels
nor
insults
were
heard
every
one
understood
that
it
was
a
great
day
a
great
festival
the
convicts
went
even
to
visit
the
other
barracks
in
order
to
wish
the
inmates
a
happy
christmas
that
day
a
sort
of
friendship
seemed
to
exist
between
them
all
i
will
remark
in
passing
that
the
convicts
have
scarcely
ever
any
intimate
friendships
it
was
very
rare
to
see
a
man
on
confidential
terms
with
any
other
man
as
in
the
outer
world
we
were
generally
harsh
and
abrupt
in
our
mutual
relations
with
some
rare
exceptions
this
was
the
general
tone
adopted
and
maintained
i
went
out
of
the
barracks
like
the
others
it
was
beginning
to
get
late
the
stars
were
paling
a
light
icy
mist
was
rising
from
the
earth
and
spirals
of
smoke
were
ascending
in
curls
from
the
chimneys
several
convicts
whom
i
met
wished
me
with
affability
a
happy
christmas
i
thanked
them
and
returned
their
wishes
some
of
them
had
never
spoken
to
me
before
near
the
kitchen
a
convict
from
the
military
barracks
with
his
sheepskin
on
his
shoulder
came
up
to
me
recognising
me
he
called
out
from
the
middle
of
the
alexander
petrovitch
he
ran
towards
me
i
waited
for
him
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
a
round
face
and
soft
eyes
and
not
at
all
communicative
as
a
rule
he
had
not
spoken
to
me
since
my
arrival
and
seemed
never
to
have
noticed
me
i
did
not
know
on
my
side
what
his
name
was
when
he
came
up
he
remained
planted
before
me
smiling
with
a
vacuous
smile
but
with
a
happy
expression
of
countenance
what
do
you
want
i
asked
not
without
astonishment
he
remained
standing
before
me
still
smiling
and
staring
but
without
replying
to
my
question
why
it
is
christmas
day
he
muttered
he
understood
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
and
now
hastened
into
the
kitchen
i
must
add
that
after
this
we
scarcely
ever
met
and
that
we
never
spoke
to
one
another
again
round
the
flaming
stoves
of
the
kitchen
the
convicts
were
rubbing
and
pushing
against
one
another
every
one
was
watching
his
own
property
the
cooks
were
preparing
the
dinner
which
was
to
take
place
a
little
earlier
than
usual
no
one
began
to
eat
before
the
time
though
a
good
many
wished
to
do
so
but
it
was
necessary
to
be
before
the
others
we
were
waiting
for
the
priest
and
the
fast
preceding
christmas
would
not
be
at
an
end
until
his
arrival
it
was
not
yet
perfectly
light
when
the
corporal
was
already
heard
shouting
out
from
behind
the
principal
gate
of
the
prison
the
kitchen
the
kitchen
these
calls
were
repeated
without
interruption
for
about
two
hours
the
cooks
were
wanted
in
order
to
receive
gifts
brought
from
all
parts
of
the
town
in
enormous
numbers
loaves
of
white
bread
scones
rusks
pancakes
and
pastry
of
various
kinds
i
do
not
think
there
was
a
in
the
whole
town
who
did
not
send
something
to
the
unfortunates
amongst
these
gifts
there
were
some
magnificent
ones
including
a
good
many
cakes
of
the
finest
flour
there
were
also
some
very
poor
ones
such
as
rolls
worth
two
kopecks
a
piece
and
a
couple
of
brown
rolls
covered
lightly
over
with
sour
cream
these
were
the
offerings
of
the
poor
to
the
poor
on
which
a
last
kopeck
had
often
been
spent
all
these
gifts
were
accepted
with
equal
gratitude
without
reference
to
the
value
or
the
giver
the
convicts
on
receiving
the
offerings
took
off
their
caps
and
thanked
the
donors
with
low
bows
wishing
them
a
happy
christmas
and
then
carried
the
things
to
the
kitchen
when
a
number
of
loaves
and
cakes
had
been
collected
the
elders
of
each
barrack
were
called
and
it
was
for
them
to
divide
the
whole
in
equal
portions
among
all
the
sections
the
division
excited
neither
protest
nor
annoyance
it
was
made
honestly
equitably
akim
akimitch
helped
by
another
prisoner
divided
between
the
convicts
of
our
barracks
the
share
assigned
to
us
and
gave
to
each
of
us
what
came
to
him
every
one
was
satisfied
no
objection
was
made
by
any
one
there
was
not
the
least
manifestation
of
envy
and
it
occurred
to
no
one
to
deceive
another
when
akim
akimitch
had
finished
at
the
kitchen
he
proceeded
religiously
to
dress
himself
and
did
so
with
a
solemn
air
he
buttoned
up
his
waistcoat
button
by
button
in
the
most
punctilious
manner
then
when
he
had
got
his
new
clothes
on
he
went
to
pray
which
occupied
him
a
considerable
time
numbers
of
convicts
fulfilled
their
religious
duties
but
these
were
for
the
most
part
old
men
the
young
men
scarcely
ever
prayed
the
most
they
did
was
to
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
when
they
rose
from
table
and
that
happened
only
on
festival
days
akim
akimitch
came
up
to
me
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
prayer
to
express
to
me
the
usual
good
wishes
i
invited
him
to
have
some
tea
and
he
returned
my
politeness
by
offering
me
some
of
his
after
some
time
petroff
came
up
to
address
to
me
the
usual
compliments
i
think
he
had
been
already
drinking
and
although
he
seemed
to
have
much
to
say
he
scarcely
spoke
he
stood
up
before
me
for
some
seconds
and
then
went
back
to
the
kitchen
the
priest
was
now
expected
in
the
military
section
of
the
barracks
this
section
was
not
constructed
like
the
others
the
were
arranged
all
along
the
wall
and
not
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
in
all
the
others
so
that
it
was
the
only
one
in
which
the
middle
was
not
obstructed
it
had
been
probably
arranged
in
this
manner
so
that
in
case
of
necessity
it
might
be
easier
to
assemble
the
convicts
a
small
table
had
been
prepared
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
a
holy
image
placed
upon
it
before
which
burned
a
little
lamp
at
last
the
priest
arrived
with
the
cross
and
holy
water
he
prayed
and
chanted
before
the
image
and
then
turned
towards
the
convicts
who
one
after
the
other
came
and
kissed
the
cross
the
priest
then
walked
through
all
the
barracks
sprinkling
them
with
holy
water
when
he
got
to
the
kitchen
he
praised
the
bread
of
the
convict
prison
which
had
quite
a
reputation
in
town
the
convicts
at
once
expressed
a
desire
to
send
him
two
loaves
of
new
bread
still
hot
which
an
old
soldier
was
ordered
to
take
to
his
house
forthwith
the
convicts
walked
back
after
the
cross
with
the
same
respect
as
they
had
received
it
almost
immediately
afterwards
the
major
and
the
commandant
arrived
the
commandant
was
liked
and
even
respected
he
made
the
tour
of
the
barracks
in
company
with
the
major
wished
the
convicts
a
happy
christmas
went
into
the
kitchen
and
tasted
the
cabbage
soup
it
was
excellent
that
day
each
convict
was
entitled
to
nearly
a
pound
of
meat
besides
which
there
was
in
it
and
certainly
the
butter
had
not
been
spared
the
major
saw
the
commandant
to
the
door
and
then
ordered
the
convicts
to
begin
dinner
each
endeavoured
not
to
be
under
the
major
eyes
they
did
not
like
his
spiteful
inquisitorial
look
from
behind
his
spectacles
as
he
wandered
from
right
to
left
seeking
apparently
some
disorder
to
repress
some
crime
to
punish
we
dined
akim
akimitch
was
admirably
roasted
i
could
never
understand
how
five
minutes
after
the
major
left
there
was
a
mass
of
drunken
prisoners
whereas
as
long
as
he
remained
every
one
was
perfectly
calm
red
radiant
faces
were
now
numerous
and
the
balalaiki
russian
banjoes
soon
appeared
then
came
the
little
pole
playing
his
violin
a
convivial
prisoner
having
engaged
him
for
the
whole
day
to
play
lively
the
conversation
became
more
animated
and
more
noisy
but
the
dinner
ended
without
great
disorders
every
one
had
had
enough
some
of
the
old
men
convicts
went
immediately
to
bed
so
did
akim
akimitch
who
probably
thought
it
was
a
duty
to
go
to
sleep
after
dinner
on
festival
days
the
old
believer
from
starodoub
after
having
slumbered
a
little
climbed
up
on
to
the
top
of
the
stove
opened
his
book
and
prayed
the
entire
day
until
late
in
the
evening
without
interruption
the
spectacle
of
so
shameless
an
orgie
was
painful
to
him
he
said
all
the
circassians
left
the
table
they
looked
with
curiosity
but
with
a
touch
of
disgust
at
this
drunken
society
i
met
nourra
aman
aman
he
said
with
a
burst
of
honest
indignation
and
shaking
his
head
what
an
offence
to
allah
isaiah
fomitch
lighted
with
an
arrogant
and
obstinate
air
a
candle
in
his
favourite
corner
and
went
to
work
in
order
to
show
that
in
his
eyes
this
was
no
holiday
here
and
there
card
parties
were
arranged
the
convicts
did
not
fear
the
old
soldiers
but
men
were
placed
on
the
in
case
the
under
officer
should
suddenly
come
in
he
made
a
point
however
of
seeing
nothing
the
officer
of
the
guard
made
altogether
three
rounds
the
prisoners
if
they
were
drunk
hid
themselves
at
once
the
cards
disappeared
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
fancy
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
notice
any
contraventions
of
an
unimportant
kind
drunkenness
was
not
an
offence
that
day
little
by
little
every
one
became
more
or
less
gay
then
there
were
some
quarrels
the
greater
number
of
the
prisoners
however
remained
calm
amusing
themselves
with
the
spectacle
of
those
who
were
intoxicated
some
of
these
drank
without
limit
gazin
was
triumphant
he
walked
about
with
a
air
by
the
side
of
his
camp
bedstead
beneath
which
he
had
concealed
his
spirits
previously
buried
beneath
the
snow
behind
the
barracks
in
a
secret
place
he
smiled
knowingly
when
he
saw
customers
arrive
in
crowds
he
was
perfectly
calm
he
had
drunk
nothing
at
all
for
it
was
his
intention
to
regale
himself
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
after
he
had
emptied
the
pockets
of
the
other
prisoners
throughout
the
barracks
the
drunkenness
was
becoming
infernal
singing
was
heard
and
the
songs
were
giving
way
to
tears
some
of
the
prisoners
walked
about
in
bands
sheepskin
on
shoulder
striking
with
a
haughty
air
the
strings
of
their
balalaiki
a
chorus
of
from
eight
to
ten
men
had
been
formed
in
the
special
section
the
singing
here
was
excellent
with
its
accompaniments
of
balalaiki
and
guitars
songs
of
a
truly
popular
kind
were
rare
i
remember
one
which
was
admirably
sung
yesterday
i
a
young
girl
went
to
the
feast
a
variation
was
introduced
previously
unknown
to
me
at
the
end
of
the
song
these
lines
were
added
at
my
house
the
house
of
a
young
girl
everything
is
in
order
i
have
washed
the
spoons
i
have
turned
out
the
i
have
wiped
down
the
panels
of
the
door
i
have
cooked
the
patties
what
they
chiefly
sang
were
prison
songs
one
of
them
called
as
it
happened
was
very
humorous
it
related
how
a
man
amused
himself
and
lived
like
a
prince
until
he
was
sent
to
the
convict
prison
where
he
fared
very
differently
another
song
only
too
popular
set
forth
how
the
hero
of
it
had
formerly
possessed
capital
but
had
now
nothing
but
captivity
here
is
a
true
convict
song
the
day
breaks
in
the
heavens
we
are
waked
up
by
the
drum
the
old
man
opens
the
door
the
warder
comes
and
calls
us
no
one
sees
us
behind
the
prison
walls
nor
how
we
live
in
this
place
but
god
the
heavenly
creator
is
with
us
he
will
not
let
us
perish
another
still
more
melancholy
but
with
a
superb
melody
was
sung
to
tame
and
incorrect
words
i
can
remember
a
few
of
the
verses
my
eyes
no
more
will
see
the
land
where
i
was
born
to
suffer
torments
undeserved
will
be
my
punishment
the
owl
will
shriek
upon
the
roof
and
raise
the
echoes
of
the
forest
my
heart
is
broken
down
with
grief
no
never
more
shall
i
return
this
song
is
often
sung
not
as
a
chorus
but
always
as
a
solo
when
the
work
is
over
a
prisoner
goes
out
of
the
barracks
sits
down
on
the
threshold
meditates
with
his
chin
resting
on
his
hand
and
then
drawls
out
his
song
in
a
high
falsetto
one
listens
to
him
and
the
effect
is
some
of
our
convicts
had
beautiful
voices
meanwhile
it
was
getting
dusk
wearisomeness
and
general
depression
were
making
themselves
felt
through
the
drunkenness
and
the
debauchery
the
prisoner
who
an
hour
beforehand
was
holding
his
sides
with
laughter
now
sobbed
in
a
corner
exceedingly
drunk
others
were
fighting
or
wandering
in
a
tottering
manner
through
the
barracks
pale
very
pale
and
seeking
whom
to
quarrel
with
these
poor
people
had
wished
to
pass
the
great
festival
in
the
most
joyous
manner
but
gracious
heaven
how
painful
the
day
was
for
all
of
them
they
had
passed
it
in
the
vague
hope
of
a
happiness
that
was
not
to
be
realised
petroff
came
up
to
me
twice
as
he
had
drunk
very
little
he
was
calm
but
until
the
last
moment
he
expected
something
which
he
made
sure
would
happen
something
extraordinary
and
highly
diverting
although
he
said
nothing
about
it
this
could
be
seen
from
his
looks
he
ran
from
barrack
to
barrack
without
fatigue
nothing
however
happened
nothing
except
general
intoxication
idiotic
insults
from
drunkards
and
general
giddiness
of
heated
heads
sirotkin
wandered
about
also
dressed
in
a
red
shirt
going
from
barrack
to
barrack
and
as
usual
he
also
was
on
the
watch
for
something
to
happen
the
spectacle
became
insupportably
repulsive
indeed
nauseating
there
were
some
laughable
things
but
i
was
too
sad
to
be
amused
by
them
i
felt
a
deep
pity
for
all
these
men
and
felt
strangled
stifled
in
the
midst
of
them
here
two
convicts
were
disputing
as
to
which
should
treat
the
other
the
dispute
lasts
a
long
time
they
have
almost
come
to
blows
one
of
them
has
for
a
long
time
past
had
a
grudge
against
the
other
he
complains
stammering
as
he
does
so
and
tries
to
prove
to
his
companion
that
he
acted
unjustly
when
a
year
before
he
sold
a
pelisse
and
concealed
the
money
there
was
more
than
this
too
the
complainant
is
a
tall
young
fellow
with
good
muscular
development
quiet
by
no
means
stupid
but
who
when
he
is
drunk
wishes
to
make
friends
with
every
one
and
to
pour
out
his
grief
into
their
bosom
he
insults
his
adversary
with
the
intention
of
becoming
reconciled
to
him
later
on
the
other
man
a
big
massive
person
with
a
round
face
as
cunning
as
a
fox
had
perhaps
drunk
more
than
his
companion
but
appeared
only
slightly
intoxicated
this
convict
has
character
and
passes
for
a
rich
man
he
has
probably
no
interest
in
irritating
his
companion
and
he
accordingly
leads
him
to
one
of
the
the
expansive
friend
declares
that
his
companion
owes
him
money
and
that
he
is
bound
to
stand
him
a
drink
if
he
has
any
pretensions
to
be
considered
an
honest
man
the
not
without
some
respect
for
his
customer
and
with
a
touch
of
contempt
for
the
expansive
friend
for
he
was
drinking
at
the
expense
of
another
man
took
a
glass
and
filled
it
with
vodka
no
stepka
you
must
pay
because
you
owe
me
money
i
wo
tire
my
tongue
talking
to
you
any
longer
replied
stepka
no
stepka
you
lie
continues
his
friend
taking
up
a
glass
offered
to
him
by
the
you
owe
me
money
and
you
must
be
without
conscience
you
have
not
a
thing
about
you
that
you
have
not
borrowed
and
i
do
believe
your
very
eyes
are
your
own

a
word
stepka

are
a
blackguard
what

whining
about

spilling

vodka

are
being
treated
why
do
you

the
to
the
expansive
friend

can
not
wait
here
until
i
will
drink

be
frightened
what
are
you
crying
out
about
my
best
wishes
for
the
day
my
best
wishes
for
the
day
stepan
doroveitch
replies
the
latter
politely
as
he
bows
glass
in
hand
towards
stepka
whom
the
moment
before
he
had
called
a
blackguard
good
health
to
you
and
may
you
live
a
hundred
years
in
addition
to
what
you
have
lived
already
he
drinks
gives
a
grunt
of
satisfaction
and
wipes
his
mouth
what
quantities
of
brandy
i
have
drunk
he
says
gravely
speaking
to
every
one
without
addressing
any
one
in
particular
but
i
have
finished
now
thank
me
stepka
doroveitch
there
is
nothing
to
thank
you
for
ah

wo
thank
me
then
i
will

every
one

treated

shall
have
something
to
tell

last
loses
patience

and
pay
attention

divide
the
world
in
two

one
half
i
the
other
then
i
shall
have
peace

not

hands

blackguard
convict
and
the
insults
exchanged
were
worse
than
they
had
been
before
the
visit
to
the
two
friends
are
seated
separately
on
two
one
is
tall
vigorous
fleshy
with
a
red
face
a
regular
butcher
he
is
on
the
point
of
weeping
for
he
has
been
much
moved
the
other
is
tall
thin
conceited
with
an
immense
nose
which
always
seems
to
have
a
cold
and
little
blue
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
he
is
a
clever
man
and
was
formerly
a
secretary
he
treats
his
friend
with
a
little
disdain
which
the
latter
can
not
stand
they
have
been
drinking
together
all
day
you
have
taken
a
liberty
with
me
cries
the
stout
one
as
with
his
left
hand
he
shakes
the
head
of
his
companion
to
take
a
liberty
signifies
in
convict
language
to
strike
this
convict
formerly
a
officer
envies
in
secret
the
elegance
of
his
neighbour
and
endeavours
to
make
up
for
his
material
grossness
by
refined
conversation
i
tell
you
you
are
wrong
says
the
secretary
in
a
dogmatic
tone
with
his
eyes
obstinately
fixed
on
the
ground
and
without
looking
at
his
companion
you
struck
me
do
you
hear
continues
the
other
still
shaking
his
dear
friend
you
are
the
only
man
in
the
world
i
care
for
but
you
shall
not
take
a
liberty
with
me
confess
my
dear
fellow
replies
the
secretary
that
all
this
is
the
result
of
too
much
drink
the
corpulent
friend
falls
back
with
a
stagger
looks
stupidly
with
his
drunken
eyes
at
the
secretary
and
suddenly
with
all
his
might
sends
his
fist
into
the
secretary
thin
face
thus
terminates
the
friendship
the
dear
friend
disappears
beneath
the
unconscious
one
of
my
acquaintances
enters
the
barracks
he
is
a
convict
of
the
special
section
very
and
gay
far
from
stupid
and
jocular
without
malice
he
is
the
man
who
on
my
arrival
at
the
convict
prison
was
looking
out
for
a
rich
peasant
who
spoke
so
much
of
his
and
ended
by
drinking
my
tea
he
was
forty
years
old
had
enormous
lips
and
a
fat
fleshy
red
nose
he
held
a
balalaika
and
struck
negligently
its
strings
he
was
followed
by
a
little
convict
with
a
large
head
whom
i
knew
very
little
and
to
whom
no
one
paid
any
attention
now
that
he
was
drunk
he
had
attached
himself
to
vermaloff
and
followed
him
like
his
shadow
at
the
same
time
gesticulating
and
striking
with
his
fist
the
wall
and
the
he
was
almost
in
tears
vermaloff
did
not
notice
him
any
more
than
if
he
had
not
existed
the
most
curious
point
was
that
these
two
men
in
no
way
resembled
one
another
neither
by
their
occupations
nor
by
their
disposition
they
belonged
to
different
sections
and
lived
in
separate
barracks
the
little
convict
was
named
bulkin
vermaloff
smiled
when
he
saw
me
seated
by
the
stove
he
stopped
at
some
distance
from
me
reflected
for
a
moment
tottered
and
then
came
towards
me
with
an
affected
swagger
then
he
swept
the
strings
of
his
instrument
and
sung
or
recited
tapping
at
the
same
time
with
his
boot
on
the
ground
the
following
chant
my
darling
with
her
full
fair
face
sings
like
a
nightingale
in
her
satin
dress
with
its
brilliant
trimming
she
is
very
fair
this
song
excited
bulkin
in
an
extraordinary
manner
he
agitated
his
arms
and
shrieked
out
to
every
one
he
lies
my
friends
he
lies
like
a
quack
doctor
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
truth
in
what
he
sings
my
respects
to
the
venerable
alexander
petrovitch
said
vermaloff
looking
at
me
with
a
knowing
smile
i
fancied
even
he
wished
to
embrace
me
he
was
drunk
as
for
the
expression
my
respects
to
the
venerable
it
is
employed
by
the
common
people
throughout
siberia
even
when
addressed
to
a
young
man
of
twenty
to
call
a
man
old
is
a
sign
of
respect
and
may
amount
even
to
flattery
well
vermaloff
how
are
you
i
replied
so
so
nothing
to
boast
of
those
who
really
enjoy
the
holiday
have
been
drinking
since
early
morning
vermaloff
did
not
speak
very
distinctly
he
lies
he
lies
again
said
bulkin
striking
the
with
a
sort
of
despair
one
might
have
sworn
that
vermaloff
had
given
his
word
of
honour
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
him
that
was
really
the
most
comic
thing
about
it
for
bulkin
had
not
quitted
him
for
one
moment
since
the
morning
always
with
him
he
quarrelled
with
vermaloff
about
every
word
wringing
his
hands
and
striking
with
his
fists
against
the
wall
and
the
camp
bedsteads
till
he
made
them
bleed
he
suffered
visibly
from
his
conviction
that
vermaloff
lied
like
a
quack
doctor
if
bulkin
had
had
hair
on
his
head
he
would
certainly
have
torn
it
in
his
grief
in
his
profound
mortification
one
might
have
thought
that
he
had
made
himself
responsible
for
vermaloff
actions
and
that
all
vermaloff
faults
troubled
his
conscience
the
amusing
part
of
it
was
that
vermaloff
continued
he
lies
he
lies
he
lies
cried
bulkin
what
can
it
matter
to
you
replied
the
convicts
with
a
laugh
i
must
tell
you
alexander
petrovitch
that
i
was
very
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
the
young
girls
were
very
fond
of
me
said
vermaloff
suddenly
he
lies
he
lies
again
interrupted
bulkin
with
a
groan
the
convicts
burst
into
a
laugh
and
well
i
got
myself
up
to
please
them
i
had
a
red
shirt
and
broad
trousers
of
cotton
velvet
i
was
happy
in
those
days
i
got
up
when
i
liked
did
whatever
i
pleased
in
fact
he
lies
declared
bulkin
i
inherited
from
my
father
a
stone
house
two
storeys
high
within
two
years
i
made
away
with
the
two
storeys
nothing
remained
to
me
but
the
street
door
well
what
of
that
money
comes
and
goes
like
a
bird
he
lies
declared
bulkin
more
resolutely
than
before
then
when
i
had
spent
all
i
sent
a
letter
to
my
relations
that
they
might
send
me
some
money
they
said
that
i
had
set
their
will
at
naught
that
i
was
disrespectful
it
is
now
seven
years
since
i
sent
off
my
letter
and
any
answer
i
asked
with
a
smile
no
he
replied
also
laughing
and
almost
putting
his
nose
in
my
face
he
then
informed
me
that
he
had
a
sweetheart
you
a
sweetheart
onufriel
said
to
me
the
other
day
young
woman
is
marked
with
and
as
ugly
as
you
like
but
she
has
plenty
of
dresses
while
yours
though
she
may
be
pretty
is
a
beggar
is
that
true
certainly
she
is
a
beggar
he
answered
he
burst
into
a
laugh
and
the
others
laughed
with
him
every
one
indeed
knew
that
he
had
a
with
a
beggar
woman
to
whom
he
gave
ten
kopecks
every
six
months
well
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
said
to
him
wishing
at
last
to
get
rid
of
him
he
remained
silent
and
then
looking
at
me
in
the
most
insinuating
manner
said
could
not
you
let
me
have
enough
money
to
buy
i
have
drunk
nothing
but
tea
the
whole
day
he
added
as
he
took
from
me
the
money
i
offered
him
and
tea
affects
me
in
such
a
manner
that
i
am
afraid
of
becoming
asthmatic
it
gives
me
the
wind
when
he
took
the
money
i
offered
him
the
despair
of
bulkin
went
beyond
all
bounds
he
gesticulated
like
a
man
possessed
good
people
all
he
cried
the
man
lies
everything
he
says
everything
is
a
lie
what
can
it
matter
to
you
cried
the
convicts
astonished
at
his
goings
on
you
are
possessed
i
will
not
allow
him
to
lie
continued
bulkin
rolling
his
eyes
and
striking
his
fist
with
energy
on
the
boards
he
shall
not
lie
every
one
laughed
vermaloff
bowed
to
me
after
receiving
the
money
and
hastened
with
many
grimaces
to
go
to
the
then
only
he
noticed
bulkin
come
he
said
to
him
as
if
the
latter
were
indispensable
for
the
execution
of
some
design
idiot
he
added
with
contempt
as
bulkin
passed
before
him
but
enough
about
this
tumultuous
scene
which
at
last
came
to
an
end
the
convicts
went
to
sleep
heavily
on
their
they
spoke
and
raged
during
their
sleep
more
than
on
the
other
nights
here
and
there
they
still
continued
to
play
at
cards
the
festival
looked
forward
to
with
such
impatience
was
now
over
and
the
daily
work
the
hard
labour
will
begin
again
chapter
xii
the
performance
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
of
the
holidays
took
place
our
first
theatrical
performance
there
had
been
much
trouble
about
organising
it
but
those
who
were
to
act
had
taken
everything
upon
themselves
and
the
other
convicts
knew
nothing
about
the
representation
except
that
it
was
to
take
place
we
did
not
even
know
what
was
to
be
played
the
actors
while
they
were
at
work
were
always
thinking
how
they
could
get
together
the
greatest
number
of
costumes
whenever
i
met
baklouchin
he
snapped
his
fingers
with
satisfaction
but
told
me
nothing
i
think
the
major
was
in
a
good
humour
but
we
did
not
know
for
certain
whether
he
knew
what
was
going
on
or
not
whether
he
had
authorised
it
or
whether
he
had
determined
to
shut
his
eyes
and
be
silent
after
assuring
himself
that
everything
would
take
place
quietly
he
had
heard
i
fancy
of
the
meditated
representation
and
said
nothing
about
it
lest
he
should
spoil
everything
the
soldiers
would
be
disorderly
or
would
get
drunk
unless
they
had
something
to
divert
them
thus
i
think
the
major
must
have
reasoned
for
it
will
be
only
natural
to
do
so
i
may
add
that
if
the
convicts
had
not
got
up
a
performance
during
the
holidays
or
done
something
of
the
kind
the
administration
would
have
been
obliged
to
organise
some
sort
of
amusement
but
as
our
major
was
distinguished
by
ideas
directly
opposed
to
those
of
other
people
i
take
a
great
responsibility
on
myself
in
saying
that
he
knew
of
our
project
and
authorised
it
a
man
like
him
must
always
be
crushing
and
stifling
some
one
taking
something
away
depriving
some
one
of
a
right
in
a
word
for
establishing
order
of
this
character
he
was
known
throughout
the
town
it
mattered
nothing
to
him
that
his
exactions
made
the
men
rebellious
for
such
offences
there
were
suitable
punishments
there
are
some
people
who
reason
in
this
way
and
with
these
rascals
of
convicts
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
treat
them
very
severely
deal
with
them
strictly
according
to
law
these
incapable
executants
of
the
law
did
not
in
the
least
understand
that
to
apply
the
law
without
understanding
its
spirit
is
to
provoke
resistance
they
are
quite
astonished
that
in
addition
to
the
execution
of
the
law
good
sense
and
a
sound
head
should
be
expected
from
them
the
last
condition
would
appear
to
them
quite
superfluous
to
require
such
a
thing
is
vexatious
intolerant
however
this
may
be
the
made
no
objection
to
the
performance
and
that
was
all
the
convicts
wanted
i
may
say
in
all
truth
that
if
throughout
the
holidays
there
were
no
disorders
in
the
convict
prison
no
sanguinary
quarrels
no
robberies
that
must
be
attributed
to
the
convicts
being
permitted
to
organise
their
performance
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
how
they
got
out
of
the
way
of
those
of
their
companions
who
had
drunk
too
much
and
how
they
prevented
quarrels
on
the
ground
that
the
representation
would
be
forbidden
the
officer
made
the
prisoners
give
their
word
of
honour
that
they
would
behave
well
and
that
all
would
go
off
quietly
they
gave
it
with
pleasure
and
kept
their
promise
religiously
they
were
much
flattered
at
finding
their
word
of
honour
accepted
let
me
add
that
the
representation
cost
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
the
authorities
who
were
not
called
upon
to
spend
a
farthing
the
theatre
could
be
put
up
and
taken
down
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
in
case
an
order
stopping
the
performance
suddenly
arrived
the
scenery
could
have
been
put
away
in
a
second
the
costumes
were
concealed
in
the
convicts
boxes
but
first
of
all
let
me
say
how
our
theatre
was
constructed
what
were
the
costumes
and
what
the
bill
that
is
to
say
the
pieces
that
were
to
be
played
to
tell
the
truth
there
was
no
written
playbill
not
at
least
for
the
first
representation
it
was
ready
only
for
the
second
and
third
baklouchin
composed
it
for
the
officers
and
other
distinguished
visitors
who
might
deign
to
honour
the
performance
with
their
presence
including
the
officer
of
the
guard
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
an
engineer
officer
it
was
in
honour
of
these
that
the
playbill
was
written
out
it
was
supposed
that
the
reputation
of
our
theatre
would
extend
to
the
fortress
and
even
to
the
town
especially
as
there
was
no
theatre
at
n
a
few
amateur
performances
but
nothing
more
the
convicts
delighted
in
the
smallest
success
and
boasted
of
it
like
children
who
knows
they
said
to
one
another
when
our
chiefs
hear
of
it
they
will
perhaps
come
and
see
then
they
will
know
what
convicts
are
worth
for
this
is
not
a
performance
given
by
soldiers
but
a
genuine
piece
played
by
genuine
actors
nothing
like
it
could
be
seen
anywhere
in
the
town
general
abrosimoff
had
a
representation
at
his
house
and
it
is
said
he
will
have
another
well
they
may
beat
us
in
the
matter
of
costumes
but
as
for
the
dialogue
that
is
a
very
different
thing
the
governor
himself
will
perhaps
hear
of
it
and
who
knows
he
may
come
himself
they
had
no
theatre
in
the
town
in
a
word
the
imagination
of
the
convicts
above
all
after
their
first
success
went
so
far
as
to
make
them
think
that
rewards
would
be
distributed
to
them
and
that
their
period
of
hard
labour
would
be
shortened
a
moment
afterwards
they
were
the
first
to
laugh
at
this
fancy
in
a
word
they
were
children
true
children
when
they
were
forty
years
of
age
i
knew
in
a
general
way
the
subjects
of
the
pieces
that
were
to
be
represented
although
there
was
no
bill
the
title
of
the
first
was
and
miroshka
baklouchin
boasted
to
me
at
least
a
week
before
the
performance
that
the
part
of
philatka
which
he
had
assigned
to
himself
would
be
played
in
such
a
manner
that
nothing
like
it
had
ever
been
seen
even
on
the
petersburg
stage
he
walked
about
in
the
barracks
puffed
up
with
boundless
importance
if
now
and
then
he
declaimed
a
speech
from
his
part
in
the
theatrical
style
every
one
burst
out
laughing
whether
the
speech
was
amusing
or
not
they
laughed
because
he
had
forgotten
himself
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
convicts
as
a
body
were
and
full
of
dignity
the
only
ones
who
got
enthusiastic
at
baklouchin
tirades
were
the
young
ones
who
had
no
false
shame
or
those
who
were
much
looked
up
to
and
whose
authority
was
so
firmly
established
that
they
were
not
afraid
to
commit
themselves
the
others
listened
silently
without
blaming
or
contradicting
but
they
did
their
best
to
show
that
the
performance
left
them
indifferent
it
was
not
until
the
very
last
moment
the
very
day
of
the
representation
that
every
one
manifested
genuine
interest
in
what
our
companions
had
undertaken
what
was
the
general
question
would
the
major
say
would
the
performance
succeed
as
well
as
the
one
given
two
years
before
etc
baklouchin
assured
me
that
all
the
actors
would
be
quite
at
home
on
the
stage
and
that
there
would
even
be
a
curtain
sirotkin
was
to
play
a
woman
part
you
will
see
how
well
i
look
in
women
clothes
he
said
the
lady
bountiful
was
to
have
a
dress
with
skirts
and
trimmings
besides
a
parasol
while
her
husband
the
lord
of
the
manor
was
to
wear
an
officer
uniform
with
epaulettes
and
a
cane
in
his
hand
the
second
piece
that
was
to
be
played
was
entitled
the
the
title
puzzled
me
much
but
it
was
useless
to
ask
any
questions
about
it
i
could
only
learn
that
the
piece
was
not
printed
it
was
a
manuscript
copy
obtained
from
a
retired
officer
in
the
town
who
had
doubtless
formerly
participated
in
its
representation
on
some
military
stage
we
have
indeed
in
the
distant
towns
and
governments
a
number
of
pieces
of
this
kind
which
i
believe
are
perfectly
unknown
and
have
never
been
printed
but
which
appear
to
have
grown
up
of
themselves
in
connection
with
the
popular
theatre
in
certain
zones
of
russia
i
have
spoken
of
the
popular
theatre
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
our
investigators
of
popular
literature
would
take
the
trouble
to
make
careful
researches
as
to
this
popular
theatre
which
exists
and
which
perhaps
is
not
so
insignificant
as
may
be
thought
i
can
not
think
that
everything
i
saw
on
the
stage
of
our
convict
prison
was
the
work
of
our
convicts
it
must
have
sprung
from
old
traditions
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
and
preserved
among
the
soldiers
the
workmen
in
industrial
towns
and
even
the
shopkeepers
in
some
poor
places
these
traditions
have
been
preserved
in
some
villages
and
some
government
towns
by
the
servants
of
the
large
landed
proprietors
i
even
believe
that
copies
of
many
old
pieces
have
been
multiplied
by
these
servants
of
the
nobility
the
old
muscovite
proprietors
and
nobles
had
their
own
theatres
in
which
their
servants
used
to
play
thence
comes
our
popular
theatre
the
originals
of
which
are
beyond
discussion
as
for
the
in
spite
of
my
lively
curiosity
i
could
learn
nothing
about
it
except
that
demons
appeared
on
the
stage
and
carried
kedril
away
to
hell
what
did
the
name
of
kedril
signify
why
was
he
called
kedril
and
not
cyril
was
the
name
russian
or
foreign
i
could
not
resolve
this
question
it
was
announced
that
the
representation
would
terminate
with
a
musical
pantomime
all
this
promised
to
be
very
curious
the
actors
were
fifteen
in
number
all
vivacious
men
they
were
very
energetic
got
up
a
number
of
rehearsals
which
sometimes
took
place
behind
the
barracks
kept
away
from
the
others
and
gave
themselves
mysterious
airs
they
evidently
wished
to
surprise
us
with
something
extraordinary
and
unexpected
on
work
days
the
barracks
were
shut
very
early
as
night
approached
but
an
exception
was
made
during
the
christmas
holidays
when
the
padlocks
were
not
put
to
the
gates
until
the
evening
retreat
nine
this
favour
had
been
granted
specially
in
view
of
the
play
during
the
whole
duration
of
the
holidays
a
deputation
was
sent
every
evening
to
the
officer
of
the
guard
very
humbly
to
permit
the
representation
and
not
to
shut
at
the
usual
hour
it
was
added
that
there
had
been
previous
representations
and
that
nothing
disorderly
had
occurred
at
any
of
them
the
officer
of
the
guard
must
have
reasoned
as
follows
there
was
no
disorder
no
infraction
of
discipline
at
the
previous
performance
and
the
moment
they
give
their
word
that
performance
shall
take
place
in
the
same
manner
they
mean
to
be
their
own
police
the
most
rigorous
police
of
all
moreover
he
knew
well
that
if
he
took
it
upon
himself
to
forbid
the
representation
these
fellows
who
knows
and
with
convicts
would
have
committed
some
offence
which
would
have
placed
the
officer
of
the
guard
in
a
very
difficult
position
one
final
reason
insured
his
consent
to
mount
guard
is
horribly
tiresome
and
if
he
authorised
the
performance
he
would
see
the
play
acted
not
by
soldiers
but
by
convicts
a
curious
set
of
people
it
would
certainly
be
interesting
and
he
had
a
right
to
be
present
at
it
in
case
the
superior
officer
arrived
and
asked
for
the
officer
of
the
guard
he
would
be
told
that
the
latter
had
gone
to
count
the
convicts
and
close
the
barracks
an
answer
which
could
easily
be
made
and
which
could
not
be
disproved
that
is
why
our
superintendents
authorised
the
performance
and
throughout
the
holidays
the
barracks
were
kept
open
each
evening
until
the
retreat
the
convicts
had
known
beforehand
that
they
would
meet
with
no
opposition
from
the
officer
of
the
guard
they
were
quite
quiet
about
him
towards
six
petroff
came
to
look
for
me
and
we
went
together
to
the
theatre
nearly
all
the
prisoners
of
our
barracks
were
there
with
the
exception
of
the
old
believer
from
tchernigoff
and
the
poles
the
latter
did
not
decide
to
be
present
until
the
last
day
of
the
representation
the
of
january
after
they
had
been
assured
that
everything
would
be
managed
in
a
becoming
manner
the
haughtiness
of
the
poles
irritated
our
convicts
accordingly
they
were
received
on
the
of
january
with
formal
politeness
and
conducted
to
the
best
places
as
for
the
circassians
and
isaiah
fomitch
the
play
was
for
them
a
genuine
delight
isaiah
fomitch
gave
three
kopecks
each
time
except
the
last
when
he
placed
ten
kopecks
on
the
plate
and
how
happy
he
looked
the
actors
had
decided
that
each
spectator
should
give
what
he
thought
fit
the
receipts
were
to
cover
the
expenses
and
anything
beyond
was
to
go
to
the
actors
petroff
assured
me
that
i
should
be
allowed
to
have
one
of
the
best
places
however
full
the
theatre
might
be
first
because
being
richer
than
the
others
there
was
a
probability
of
my
giving
more
and
secondly
because
i
knew
more
about
acting
than
any
one
else
what
he
had
foreseen
took
place
but
let
me
first
describe
the
theatre
the
barrack
of
the
military
section
which
had
been
turned
into
the
theatre
was
fifteen
feet
long
from
the
one
entered
first
an
and
afterwards
the
barrack
itself
the
building
was
arranged
as
i
have
already
mentioned
in
a
particular
manner
the
beds
being
placed
against
the
wall
so
as
to
leave
an
open
space
in
the
middle
one
half
of
the
barrack
was
reserved
for
the
spectators
while
the
other
which
communicated
with
the
second
building
formed
the
stage
what
astonished
me
directly
i
entered
was
the
curtain
which
was
about
ten
feet
long
and
divided
the
barrack
into
two
it
was
indeed
a
marvel
for
it
was
painted
in
oil
and
represented
trees
tunnels
ponds
and
stars
it
was
made
of
pieces
of
linen
old
and
new
given
by
the
convicts
shirts
the
bandages
which
our
peasants
wrap
round
their
feet
in
lieu
of
socks
all
sewn
together
well
or
ill
and
forming
together
an
immense
sheet
where
there
was
not
enough
linen
it
had
been
replaced
by
writing
paper
taken
sheet
by
sheet
from
the
various
office
bureaus
our
painters
among
whom
we
had
our
bruloff
had
painted
it
all
over
and
the
effect
was
very
remarkable
this
luxurious
curtain
delighted
the
convicts
even
the
most
sombre
and
most
morose
these
however
like
the
others
as
soon
as
the
play
began
showed
themselves
mere
children
they
were
all
pleased
and
satisfied
with
a
certain
satisfaction
of
vanity
the
theatre
was
lighted
with
candle
ends
two
benches
which
had
been
brought
from
the
kitchen
were
placed
before
the
curtain
together
with
three
or
four
large
chairs
borrowed
from
the
officers
room
these
chairs
were
for
the
officers
should
they
think
fit
to
honour
the
performance
as
for
the
benches
they
were
for
the
officers
engineers
clerks
directors
of
the
works
and
all
the
immediate
superiors
of
the
convicts
who
had
not
officer
rank
and
who
had
come
perhaps
to
take
a
look
at
the
representation
in
fact
there
was
no
lack
of
visitors
according
to
the
days
they
came
in
greater
or
smaller
numbers
while
for
the
last
representation
there
was
not
a
single
place
unoccupied
on
the
benches
at
the
back
the
convicts
stood
crowded
together
standing
up
out
of
respect
to
the
visitors
and
dressed
in
their
vests
or
in
their
short
pelisses
in
spite
of
the
suffocating
heat
as
might
have
been
expected
the
place
was
too
small
so
all
the
prisoners
stood
up
heaped
together
above
all
in
the
last
rows
the
were
all
occupied
and
there
were
some
amateurs
who
disputed
constantly
behind
the
stage
in
the
other
barrack
and
who
viewed
the
performance
from
the
back
i
was
asked
to
go
forward
and
petroff
with
me
close
to
the
benches
whence
a
good
view
could
be
obtained
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
good
judge
a
connoisseur
who
had
seen
many
other
theatres
the
convicts
remarked
that
baklouchin
had
often
consulted
me
and
that
he
had
shown
deference
to
my
advice
consequently
they
thought
that
i
ought
to
be
treated
with
honour
and
to
have
one
of
the
best
places
these
men
are
vain
and
frivolous
but
only
on
the
surface
they
laughed
at
me
when
i
was
at
work
because
i
was
a
poor
workman
almazoff
had
a
right
to
despise
us
gentlemen
and
to
boast
of
his
superior
skill
in
pounding
the
alabaster
his
laughter
and
raillery
were
directed
against
our
origin
for
we
belonged
by
birth
to
the
caste
of
his
former
masters
of
whom
he
could
not
preserve
a
good
recollection
but
here
at
the
theatre
these
same
men
made
way
for
me
for
they
knew
that
about
this
matter
i
knew
more
than
they
did
those
even
who
were
not
at
all
well
disposed
towards
me
were
glad
to
hear
me
praise
the
performance
and
gave
way
to
me
without
the
least
servility
i
judged
now
by
my
impressions
of
that
time
i
understood
that
in
this
new
view
of
theirs
there
was
no
lowering
of
themselves
rather
a
sentiment
of
their
own
dignity
the
most
striking
characteristic
of
our
people
is
its
conscientiousness
and
its
love
of
justice
no
false
vanity
no
sly
ambition
to
reach
the
first
rank
without
being
entitled
to
do
so
such
faults
are
foreign
to
our
people
take
it
from
its
rough
shell
and
you
will
perceive
if
you
study
it
without
prejudice
attentively
and
close
at
hand
qualities
which
you
would
never
have
suspected
our
sages
have
very
little
to
teach
our
people
i
will
even
say
more
they
might
take
lessons
from
it
petroff
had
told
me
innocently
on
taking
me
into
the
theatre
that
they
would
pass
me
to
the
front
because
they
expected
more
money
from
me
there
were
no
fixed
prices
for
the
places
each
one
gave
what
he
liked
and
what
he
could
nearly
every
one
placed
a
piece
of
money
in
the
plate
when
it
was
handed
round
even
if
they
had
passed
me
forward
in
the
hope
that
i
should
give
more
than
others
was
there
not
in
that
a
certain
feeling
of
personal
dignity
you
are
richer
than
i
am
go
to
the
first
row
we
are
all
equal
here
it
is
true
but
you
pay
more
and
the
actors
prefer
a
spectator
like
you
occupy
the
first
place
then
for
we
are
not
here
with
money
and
must
arrange
ourselves
anyhow
what
noble
pride
in
this
mode
of
action
in
final
analysis
not
love
of
money
but
there
was
little
esteem
for
money
among
us
i
do
not
remember
that
one
of
us
ever
lowered
himself
to
obtain
money
some
men
used
to
make
up
to
me
but
from
love
of
cunning
and
of
fun
rather
than
in
the
hope
of
obtaining
any
benefit
i
do
not
know
whether
i
explain
myself
clearly
i
am
in
any
case
forgetting
the
performance
let
me
return
to
it
before
the
rise
of
the
curtain
the
room
presented
a
strange
and
animated
look
in
the
first
place
the
crowd
pressed
crushed
jammed
together
on
all
sides
but
impatient
full
of
expectation
every
face
glowing
with
delight
in
the
last
ranks
was
the
grovelling
confused
mass
of
convicts
many
of
them
had
brought
with
them
logs
of
wood
which
they
placed
against
the
wall
on
which
they
climbed
up
in
this
fatiguing
position
they
paused
to
rest
themselves
by
placing
both
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
their
companions
who
seemed
quite
at
ease
others
stood
on
their
toes
with
their
heels
against
the
stove
and
thus
remained
throughout
the
representation
supported
by
those
around
them
massed
against
the
was
another
compact
crowd
for
here
were
some
of
the
best
places
of
all
five
convicts
had
hoisted
themselves
up
to
the
top
of
the
stove
whence
they
had
a
commanding
view
these
fortunate
ones
were
extremely
happy
elsewhere
swarmed
the
late
arrivals
unable
to
find
good
places
every
one
conducted
himself
in
a
becoming
manner
without
making
any
noise
each
one
wished
to
show
advantageously
before
the
distinguished
persons
who
were
visiting
us
simple
and
natural
was
the
expression
of
these
red
faces
damp
with
perspiration
as
the
rise
of
the
curtain
was
eagerly
expected
what
a
strange
look
of
infinite
delight
of
unmixed
pleasure
was
painted
on
these
scarred
faces
these
branded
foreheads
so
dark
and
menacing
at
ordinary
times
they
were
all
without
their
caps
and
as
i
looked
back
at
them
from
my
place
it
seemed
to
me
that
their
heads
were
entirely
shaved
suddenly
the
signal
is
given
and
the
orchestra
begins
to
play
this
orchestra
deserves
a
special
mention
it
consisted
of
eight
musicians
two
violins
one
of
which
was
the
property
of
a
convict
while
the
other
had
been
borrowed
from
outside
three
balalaiki
made
by
the
convicts
themselves
two
guitars
and
a
tambourine
the
violins
sighed
and
shrieked
and
the
guitars
were
worthless
but
the
balalaiki
were
remarkably
good
and
the
agile
fingering
of
the
artists
would
have
done
honour
to
the
cleverest
executant
they
played
scarcely
anything
but
dance
tunes
at
the
most
exciting
passages
they
struck
with
their
fingers
on
the
body
of
their
instruments
the
tone
the
execution
of
the
motive
were
always
original
and
distinctive
one
of
the
guitarists
knew
his
instrument
thoroughly
it
was
the
gentleman
who
had
killed
his
father
as
for
the
tambourinist
he
really
did
wonders
now
he
whirled
round
the
disk
balanced
on
one
of
his
fingers
now
he
rubbed
the
parchment
with
his
thumb
and
brought
from
it
a
countless
multitude
of
notes
now
dull
now
brilliant
at
last
two
harmonigers
join
the
orchestra
i
had
no
idea
until
then
of
all
that
could
be
done
with
these
popular
and
vulgar
instruments
i
was
astonished
the
harmony
but
above
all
the
expression
the
very
conception
of
the
motive
were
admirably
rendered
i
then
understood
perfectly
and
for
the
first
time
the
remarkable
boldness
the
striking
abandonment
which
are
expressed
in
our
popular
dance
tunes
and
our
village
songs
at
last
the
curtain
rose
every
one
made
a
movement
those
who
were
at
the
back
raised
themselves
upon
the
point
of
their
feet
some
one
fell
down
from
his
log
at
once
there
were
looks
that
enjoined
silence
the
performance
now
began
i
was
seated
not
far
from
ali
who
was
in
the
midst
of
the
group
formed
by
his
brothers
and
the
other
circassians
they
had
a
passionate
love
of
the
theatre
and
did
not
miss
one
of
our
evenings
i
have
remarked
that
all
the
mohammedans
circassians
and
so
on
are
fond
of
all
kinds
of
representations
near
them
was
isaiah
fomitch
quite
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
as
soon
as
the
curtain
rose
he
was
all
ears
and
eyes
his
countenance
expressed
an
expectation
of
something
marvellous
i
should
have
been
grieved
had
he
been
disappointed
the
charming
face
of
ali
shone
with
a
childish
joy
so
pure
that
i
was
quite
happy
to
behold
it
involuntarily
whenever
a
general
laugh
echoed
an
amusing
remark
i
turned
towards
him
to
see
his
countenance
he
did
not
notice
it
he
had
something
else
to
do
near
him
placed
on
the
left
was
a
convict
already
old
sombre
discontented
and
always
grumbling
he
also
had
noticed
ali
and
i
saw
him
cast
furtive
glances
more
than
once
towards
him
so
charming
was
the
young
circassian
the
prisoners
always
called
him
ali
simeonitch
without
my
knowing
why
in
the
first
piece
and
baklouchin
in
the
part
of
philatka
was
really
marvellous
he
played
his
rôle
to
perfection
it
could
be
seen
that
he
had
weighed
each
speech
each
movement
he
managed
to
give
to
each
word
each
gesture
a
meaning
which
responded
perfectly
to
the
character
of
the
personage
apart
from
the
conscientious
study
he
had
made
of
the
character
he
was
gay
simple
natural
irresistible
if
you
had
seen
baklouchin
you
would
certainly
have
said
that
he
was
a
genuine
actor
an
actor
by
vocation
and
of
great
talent
i
have
seen
philatka
several
times
at
the
petersburg
and
moscow
theatres
and
i
declare
that
none
of
our
celebrated
actors
was
equal
to
baklouchin
in
this
part
they
were
peasants
from
no
matter
what
country
and
not
true
russian
moujiks
moreover
their
desire
to
be
was
too
apparent
baklouchin
was
animated
by
emulation
for
it
was
known
that
the
convict
potsiakin
was
to
play
the
part
of
kedril
in
the
second
piece
and
it
was
assumed
i
do
not
know
why
that
the
latter
would
show
more
talent
than
baklouchin
the
latter
was
as
vexed
by
this
preference
as
a
child
how
many
times
did
he
not
come
to
me
during
the
last
days
to
tell
me
all
he
felt
two
hours
before
the
representation
he
was
attacked
by
fever
when
the
audience
burst
out
laughing
and
called
out
bravo
baklouchin
what
a
fellow
you
are
his
figure
shone
with
joy
and
true
inspiration
could
be
read
in
his
eyes
the
scene
of
the
kisses
between
kiroshka
and
philatka
in
which
the
latter
calls
out
to
the
daughter
wife
your
mouth
and
then
wipes
his
own
was
wonderfully
comic
every
one
burst
out
laughing
what
interested
me
was
the
spectators
they
were
all
at
their
ease
and
gave
themselves
up
frankly
to
their
mirth
cries
of
approbation
became
more
and
more
numerous
a
convict
nudged
his
companion
with
his
elbow
and
hastily
communicated
his
impressions
without
even
troubling
himself
to
know
who
was
by
his
side
when
a
comic
song
began
one
man
might
be
seen
agitating
his
arms
violently
as
if
to
engage
his
companions
to
laugh
after
which
he
turned
suddenly
towards
the
stage
a
third
smacked
his
tongue
against
his
palate
and
could
not
keep
quiet
a
moment
but
as
there
was
not
room
for
him
to
change
his
position
he
hopped
first
on
one
leg
then
on
the
other
towards
the
end
of
the
piece
the
general
gaiety
attained
its
climax
i
exaggerate
nothing
imagine
the
convict
prison
chains
captivity
long
years
of
confinement
of
of
monotonous
life
falling
away
drop
by
drop
like
rain
on
an
autumn
day
imagine
all
this
despair
in
presence
of
permission
given
to
the
convicts
to
amuse
themselves
to
breathe
freely
for
an
hour
to
forget
their
nightmare
and
to
organise
a
play
and
what
a
play
one
that
excited
the
envy
and
admiration
of
our
town
fancy
those
convicts
people
said
everything
interested
them
take
the
costumes
for
instance
it
seemed
very
strange
but
then
to
see
nietsvitaeff
or
baklouchin
in
a
different
costume
from
the
one
they
had
worn
for
so
many
years
he
is
a
convict
a
genuine
convict
whose
chains
ring
when
he
walks
and
there
he
is
out
on
the
stage
with
a
and
a
round
hat
and
a
cloak
like
any
ordinary
civilian
he
has
put
on
hair
moustaches
he
takes
a
red
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
shakes
it
like
a
real
nobleman
what
enthusiasm
is
created
the
good
landlord
arrives
in
an
uniform
a
very
old
one
it
is
true
but
with
epaulettes
and
a
cocked
hat
the
effect
produced
was
indescribable
there
had
been
two
candidates
for
this
costume
and
will
it
be
believed
they
had
quarrelled
like
two
little
schoolboys
as
to
which
of
them
should
play
the
part
both
wanted
to
appear
in
military
uniform
with
epaulettes
the
other
actors
separated
them
and
by
a
majority
of
voices
the
part
was
entrusted
to
nietsvitaeff
not
because
he
was
more
suited
to
it
than
the
other
and
that
he
bore
a
greater
resemblance
to
a
nobleman
but
only
because
he
had
assured
them
all
that
he
would
have
a
cane
and
that
he
would
twirl
it
and
rap
it
out
grand
like
a
true
nobleman
a
dandy
of
the
latest
fashion
which
was
more
than
vanka
and
ospiety
could
do
seeing
they
have
never
known
any
noblemen
in
fact
when
nietsvitaeff
went
to
the
stage
with
his
wife
he
did
nothing
but
draw
circles
on
the
floor
with
his
light
bamboo
cane
evidently
thinking
that
this
was
the
sign
of
the
best
breeding
of
supreme
elegance
probably
in
his
childhood
when
he
was
still
a
barefooted
child
he
had
been
attracted
by
the
skill
of
some
proprietor
in
twirling
his
cane
and
this
impression
had
remained
in
his
memory
although
thirty
years
afterwards
nietsvitaeff
was
so
occupied
with
his
process
that
he
saw
no
one
he
gave
the
replies
in
his
dialogue
without
even
raising
his
eyes
the
most
important
thing
for
him
was
the
end
of
his
cane
and
the
circles
he
drew
with
it
the
lady
bountiful
was
also
very
remarkable
she
came
on
in
an
old
muslin
dress
which
looked
like
a
rag
her
arms
and
neck
were
bare
she
had
a
little
calico
cap
on
her
head
with
strings
under
her
chin
an
umbrella
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
fan
of
coloured
paper
with
which
she
constantly
fanned
herself
this
great
lady
was
welcomed
with
a
wild
laugh
she
herself
too
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
and
burst
out
more
than
once
the
part
was
filled
by
the
convict
ivanoff
as
for
sirotkin
in
his
girl
dress
he
looked
exceedingly
well
the
couplets
were
all
well
sung
in
a
word
the
piece
was
played
to
the
satisfaction
of
every
one
not
the
least
hostile
criticism
was
passed
who
indeed
was
there
to
criticise
the
air
sieni
moi
sieni
was
played
again
by
way
of
overture
and
the
curtain
again
went
up
the
was
now
to
be
played
kedril
is
a
sort
of
don
juan
this
comparison
may
justly
be
made
for
the
master
and
the
servant
are
both
carried
away
by
devils
at
the
end
of
the
piece
and
the
piece
as
the
convicts
had
it
was
played
quite
correctly
but
the
beginning
and
the
end
must
have
been
lost
for
it
had
neither
head
nor
tail
the
scene
is
laid
in
an
inn
somewhere
in
russia
the
innkeeper
introduces
into
a
room
a
nobleman
wearing
a
cloak
and
a
battered
round
hat
the
valet
kedril
follows
his
master
he
carries
a
valise
and
a
fowl
rolled
up
in
blue
paper
he
wears
a
short
pelisse
and
a
footman
cap
it
is
this
fellow
who
is
the
glutton
the
convict
potsiakin
the
rival
of
baklouchin
played
this
part
while
the
part
of
the
nobleman
was
filled
by
ivanoff
the
same
who
played
the
great
lady
in
the
first
piece
the
innkeeper
nietsvitaeff
warns
the
nobleman
that
the
room
is
haunted
by
demons
and
goes
away
the
nobleman
is
interested
and
preoccupied
he
murmurs
aloud
that
he
has
known
that
for
a
long
time
and
orders
kedril
to
unpack
his
things
and
to
get
supper
ready
kedril
is
a
glutton
and
a
coward
when
he
hears
of
devils
he
turns
pale
and
trembles
like
a
leaf
he
would
like
to
run
away
but
is
afraid
of
his
master
besides
he
is
hungry
he
is
voluptuous
he
is
sensual
stupid
though
cunning
in
his
way
and
as
before
said
a
poltroon
he
cheats
his
master
every
moment
though
he
fears
him
like
fire
this
type
of
servant
is
a
remarkable
one
in
which
may
be
recognised
the
principal
features
of
the
character
of
leporello
but
indistinct
and
confused
the
part
was
played
in
really
superior
style
by
potsiakin
whose
talent
was
beyond
discussion
surpassing
as
it
did
in
my
opinion
that
of
baklouchin
himself
but
when
the
next
day
i
spoke
to
baklouchin
i
concealed
my
impression
from
him
knowing
that
it
would
give
him
bitter
pain
as
for
the
convict
who
played
the
part
of
the
nobleman
it
was
not
bad
everything
he
said
was
without
meaning
incomparable
to
anything
i
had
ever
heard
before
but
his
enunciation
was
pure
and
his
gestures
becoming
while
kedril
occupies
himself
with
the
valise
his
master
walks
up
and
down
and
announces
that
from
that
day
forth
he
means
to
lead
a
quiet
life
kedril
listens
makes
grimaces
and
amuses
the
spectators
by
his
reflections
aside
he
has
no
pity
for
his
master
but
he
has
heard
of
devils
would
like
to
know
what
they
are
like
and
thereupon
questions
him
the
nobleman
replies
that
some
time
ago
being
in
danger
of
death
he
asked
succour
from
hell
then
the
devils
aided
and
delivered
him
but
the
term
of
his
liberty
has
expired
and
if
the
devils
come
that
evening
it
will
be
to
exact
his
soul
as
has
been
agreed
in
their
compact
kedril
begins
to
tremble
in
earnest
but
his
master
does
not
lose
courage
and
orders
him
to
prepare
the
supper
hearing
of
victuals
kedril
revives
taking
out
a
bottle
of
wine
he
taps
it
on
his
own
account
the
audience
expands
with
laughter
but
the
door
grates
on
its
hinges
the
winds
shakes
the
shutters
kedril
trembles
and
hastily
almost
without
knowing
what
he
is
doing
puts
into
his
mouth
an
enormous
piece
of
fowl
which
he
is
unable
to
swallow
there
is
another
gust
of
wind
is
it
ready
cries
the
master
still
walking
backwards
and
forwards
in
his
room
directly
sir
i
am
preparing
it
says
kedril
who
sits
down
and
taking
care
that
his
master
does
not
see
him
begins
to
eat
the
supper
himself
the
audience
is
evidently
charmed
with
the
cunning
of
the
servant
who
so
cleverly
makes
game
of
the
nobleman
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
poseikin
the
representative
of
the
part
deserved
high
praise
he
pronounced
admirably
the
words
directly
sir
i
am
preparing
it
kedril
eats
gradually
and
at
each
mouthful
trembles
lest
his
master
shall
see
him
every
time
that
the
nobleman
turns
round
kedril
hides
under
the
table
holding
the
fowl
in
his
hand
when
he
has
appeased
his
hunger
he
begins
to
think
of
his
master
kedril
will
it
soon
be
ready
cries
the
nobleman
it
is
ready
now
replies
kedril
boldly
when
all
at
once
he
perceives
that
there
is
scarcely
anything
left
nothing
remains
but
one
leg
the
master
still
sombre
and
notices
nothing
and
takes
his
seat
while
kedril
places
himself
behind
him
with
a
napkin
on
his
arm
every
word
every
gesture
every
grimace
from
the
servant
as
he
turns
towards
the
audience
to
laugh
at
his
master
expense
excites
the
greatest
mirth
among
the
convicts
just
at
the
moment
when
the
young
nobleman
begins
to
eat
the
devils
arrive
they
resemble
nothing
human
or
terrestrial
the
opens
and
the
phantom
appears
dressed
entirely
in
white
with
a
lighted
lantern
in
lieu
of
a
head
and
with
a
scythe
in
its
hand
why
the
white
dress
scythe
and
lantern
no
one
could
tell
me
and
the
matter
did
not
trouble
the
convicts
they
were
sure
that
this
was
the
way
it
ought
to
be
done
the
master
comes
forward
courageously
to
meet
the
apparitions
and
calls
out
to
them
that
he
is
ready
and
that
they
can
take
him
but
kedril
as
timid
as
a
hare
hides
under
the
table
not
forgetting
in
spite
of
his
fright
to
take
a
bottle
with
him
the
devils
disappear
kedril
comes
out
of
his
and
the
master
begins
to
eat
his
fowl
three
devils
enter
the
room
and
seize
him
to
take
him
to
hell
save
me
kedril
he
cries
but
kedril
has
something
else
to
think
of
he
has
now
with
him
in
his
not
only
the
bottle
but
also
the
plate
of
fowl
and
the
bread
he
is
now
alone
the
demons
are
far
away
and
his
master
also
kedril
gets
from
under
the
table
looks
all
round
and
suddenly
his
face
beams
with
joy
he
winks
like
the
rogue
he
is
sits
down
in
his
master
place
and
whispers
to
the
audience
i
have
now
no
master
but
myself
every
one
laughs
at
seeing
him
masterless
and
he
says
always
in
an
and
with
a
confidential
air
the
devils
have
carried
him
off
the
enthusiasm
of
the
spectators
is
now
without
limits
the
last
phrase
was
uttered
with
such
roguery
with
such
a
triumphant
grimace
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
applaud
but
kedril
happiness
does
not
last
long
hardly
has
he
taken
up
the
bottle
of
wine
and
poured
himself
out
a
large
glass
which
he
carries
to
his
lips
than
the
devils
return
slip
behind
and
seize
him
kedril
howls
like
one
possessed
but
he
dare
not
turn
round
he
wishes
to
defend
himself
but
can
not
for
in
his
hands
he
holds
the
bottle
and
the
glass
from
which
he
will
not
separate
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
his
mouth
gaping
with
horror
he
remains
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
audience
with
a
comic
expression
of
cowardice
that
might
have
been
painted
at
last
he
is
dragged
carried
away
his
arms
and
legs
are
agitated
in
every
direction
but
he
still
sticks
to
his
bottle
he
also
shrieks
and
his
cries
are
still
heard
when
he
has
been
carried
from
the
stage
the
curtain
falls
amid
general
laughter
and
every
one
is
delighted
the
orchestra
now
attacks
the
famous
dance
tune
kamarinskaia
first
it
is
played
softly
pianissimo
but
little
by
little
the
motive
is
developed
and
played
more
lightly
the
time
is
quickened
and
the
wood
as
well
as
the
strings
of
the
balalaiki
is
made
to
sound
the
musicians
enter
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
dance
glinka
who
has
arranged
the
kamarinskaia
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
and
with
harmonies
of
his
own
devising
for
full
orchestra
should
have
heard
it
as
it
was
executed
in
our
convict
prison
the
pantomimic
musical
accompaniment
is
begun
and
throughout
the
kamarinskaia
is
played
the
stage
represents
the
interior
of
a
hut
a
miller
and
his
wife
are
sitting
down
one
mending
clothes
the
other
spinning
flax
sirotkin
plays
the
part
of
the
wife
and
nietsvitaeff
that
of
the
husband
our
scenery
was
very
poor
in
this
piece
as
in
the
preceding
ones
imagination
had
to
supply
what
was
wanting
in
reality
instead
of
a
wall
at
the
back
of
the
stage
there
was
a
carpet
or
a
blanket
on
the
right
shabby
screens
while
on
the
left
where
the
stage
was
not
closed
the
could
be
seen
but
the
spectators
were
not
exacting
and
were
willing
to
imagine
all
that
was
wanting
it
was
an
easy
task
for
them
all
convicts
are
great
dreamers
directly
they
are
told
this
is
a
garden
it
is
for
them
a
garden
informed
that
this
is
a
hut
they
accept
the
definition
without
difficulty
to
them
it
is
a
hut
sirotkin
was
charming
in
a
dress
the
miller
finishes
his
work
takes
his
cap
and
his
whip
goes
up
to
his
wife
and
gives
her
to
understand
by
signs
that
if
during
his
absence
she
makes
the
mistake
of
receiving
any
one
she
will
have
to
deal
with
him
and
he
shows
her
his
whip
the
wife
listens
and
nods
affirmatively
her
head
the
whip
is
evidently
known
to
her
the
hussey
has
often
deserved
it
the
husband
goes
out
hardly
has
he
turned
upon
his
heel
than
his
wife
shakes
her
fist
at
him
there
is
a
knock
the
door
opens
and
in
comes
a
neighbour
miller
also
by
trade
he
wears
a
beard
is
in
a
kuftan
and
he
brings
as
a
present
a
red
handkerchief
the
woman
smiles
another
knock
is
heard
at
the
door
where
shall
she
hide
him
she
conceals
him
under
the
table
and
takes
up
her
distaff
again
another
admirer
now
presents
himself
a
farrier
in
the
uniform
of
a
officer
until
now
the
pantomime
had
gone
on
capitally
the
gestures
of
the
actors
being
irreproachable
it
was
astounding
to
see
these
improvised
players
going
through
their
parts
in
so
correct
a
manner
and
involuntarily
one
said
to
oneself
what
a
deal
of
talent
is
lost
in
our
russia
left
without
use
in
our
prisons
and
places
of
exile
the
convict
who
played
the
part
of
the
farrier
had
doubtless
taken
part
in
a
performance
at
some
provincial
theatre
or
had
played
with
amateurs
it
seemed
to
me
in
any
case
that
our
actors
knew
nothing
of
acting
as
an
art
and
bore
themselves
in
the
meanest
manner
when
it
was
his
turn
to
appear
he
came
on
like
one
of
the
classical
heroes
of
the
old
repertory
taking
a
long
stride
with
one
foot
before
he
raised
the
other
from
the
ground
throwing
back
his
head
on
the
upper
part
of
his
body
and
casting
proud
looks
around
him
if
such
a
gait
was
ridiculous
on
the
part
of
classical
heroes
still
more
so
was
it
when
the
actor
was
representing
a
comic
character
but
the
audience
thought
it
quite
natural
and
accepted
the
actor
triumphant
walk
as
a
necessary
fact
without
criticising
it
a
moment
after
the
entry
of
the
second
admirer
there
is
another
knock
at
the
door
the
wife
loses
her
head
where
is
the
farrier
to
be
concealed
in
her
big
box
it
fortunately
is
open
the
farrier
disappears
within
it
and
the
lid
falls
upon
him
the
new
arrival
is
a
brahmin
in
full
costume
his
entry
is
hailed
by
the
spectators
with
a
formidable
laugh
this
brahmin
is
represented
by
the
convict
cutchin
who
plays
the
part
perfectly
thanks
in
a
great
measure
to
a
suitable
physiognomy
he
explains
in
the
pantomime
his
love
of
the
miller
wife
raises
his
hands
to
heaven
and
then
clasps
them
on
his
breast
there
is
now
another
knock
at
the
door
a
vigorous
one
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
about
it
it
is
the
master
of
the
house
the
miller
wife
loses
her
head
the
brahmin
runs
wildly
on
all
sides
begging
to
be
concealed
she
helps
him
to
slip
behind
the
cupboard
and
begins
to
spin
and
goes
on
spinning
without
thinking
of
opening
the
door
in
her
fright
she
gets
the
thread
twisted
drops
the
spindle
and
in
her
agitation
makes
the
gesture
of
turning
it
when
it
is
lying
on
the
ground
sirotkin
represented
perfectly
this
state
of
alarm
then
the
miller
kicks
open
the
door
and
approaches
his
wife
whip
in
hand
he
has
seen
everything
for
he
was
spying
outside
and
he
indicates
by
signs
to
his
wife
that
she
has
three
lovers
concealed
in
the
house
then
he
searches
them
out
first
he
finds
the
neighbour
whom
he
drives
out
with
his
fist
the
frightened
farrier
tries
to
escape
he
raises
with
his
head
the
cover
of
the
chest
and
is
at
once
seen
the
miller
thrashes
him
with
his
whip
and
for
once
this
gallant
does
not
march
in
the
classical
style
the
only
one
now
remaining
is
the
brahmin
whom
the
husband
seeks
for
some
time
without
finding
him
at
last
he
discovers
him
in
his
corner
behind
the
cupboard
bows
to
him
politely
and
then
draws
him
by
his
beard
into
the
middle
of
the
stage
the
brahmin
tries
to
defend
himself
and
cries
out
accursed
accursed
the
only
words
pronounced
throughout
the
pantomime
but
the
husband
will
not
listen
to
him
and
after
settling
accounts
with
him
turns
to
his
wife
seeing
that
her
turn
has
come
she
throws
away
both
wheel
and
spindle
and
runs
out
causing
an
earthen
pot
to
fall
as
she
shakes
the
room
in
her
fright
the
convicts
burst
into
a
laugh
and
ali
without
looking
at
me
takes
my
hand
and
calls
out
see
see
the
brahmin
he
can
not
hold
himself
upright
so
overpowering
is
his
laugh
the
curtain
falls
and
another
song
begins
there
were
two
or
three
more
all
broadly
humorous
and
very
droll
the
convicts
had
not
composed
them
themselves
but
they
had
contributed
something
to
them
every
actor
improvised
to
such
purpose
that
the
part
was
a
different
one
each
evening
the
pantomime
ended
with
a
ballet
in
which
there
was
a
burial
the
brahmin
went
through
various
incantations
over
the
corpse
and
with
effect
the
dead
man
returns
to
life
and
in
their
joy
all
present
begin
to
dance
the
brahmin
dances
in
brahminical
style
with
the
dead
man
this
was
the
final
scene
the
convicts
now
separated
happy
delighted
and
full
of
praise
for
the
actors
and
gratitude
towards
the
officers
there
was
not
the
least
quarrel
and
they
all
went
to
bed
with
peaceful
hearts
to
sleep
with
a
sleep
by
no
means
familiar
to
them
this
is
no
fantasy
of
my
imagination
but
the
truth
the
very
truth
these
unhappy
men
had
been
permitted
to
live
for
some
moments
in
their
own
way
to
amuse
themselves
in
a
human
manner
to
escape
for
a
brief
hour
from
their
sad
position
as
convicts
and
a
moral
change
was
effected
at
least
for
a
time
the
night
is
already
quite
dark
something
makes
me
shudder
and
i
awake
the
old
believer
is
still
on
the
top
of
the
high
porcelain
stove
praying
and
he
will
continue
to
pray
until
dawn
ali
is
sleeping
peacefully
by
my
side
i
remember
that
when
he
went
to
bed
he
was
still
laughing
and
talking
about
the
theatre
with
his
brothers
little
by
little
i
began
to
remember
everything
the
preceding
day
the
christmas
holidays
and
the
whole
month
i
raised
my
head
in
fright
and
looked
at
my
companions
who
were
sleeping
by
the
trembling
light
of
the
candle
provided
by
the
authorities
i
look
at
their
unhappy
countenances
their
miserable
beds
i
view
this
nakedness
the
wretchedness
and
then
convince
myself
that
it
is
not
a
frightful
night
there
but
a
simple
reality
yes
it
is
a
reality
i
hear
a
groan
some
one
has
moved
his
arm
and
made
his
chains
rattle
another
one
is
agitated
in
his
dreams
and
speaks
aloud
while
the
old
grandfather
is
praying
for
the
orthodox
christians
i
listened
to
his
prayer
uttered
with
regularity
in
soft
rather
drawling
tones
lord
jesus
christ
have
mercy
upon
us
well
i
am
not
here
for
ever
but
only
for
a
few
years
i
said
to
myself
and
i
again
laid
my
head
down
on
my
pillow
part
ii
chapter
i
the
hospital
shortly
after
the
christmas
holidays
i
felt
ill
and
had
to
go
to
our
military
hospital
which
stood
apart
at
about
half
a
verst
of
a
mile
from
the
fortress
it
was
a
building
very
long
and
painted
yellow
every
summer
a
great
quantity
of
ochre
was
expended
in
brightening
it
up
in
the
immense
stood
buildings
including
those
where
the
chief
physicians
lived
while
the
principal
building
contained
only
wards
intended
for
the
patients
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
but
as
only
two
were
reserved
for
the
convicts
these
latter
were
nearly
always
full
above
all
in
summer
so
that
it
was
often
necessary
to
bring
the
beds
closer
together
these
wards
were
occupied
by
unfortunates
of
all
kinds
first
by
our
own
then
by
military
prisoners
previously
incarcerated
in
the
there
were
others
again
who
had
not
yet
been
tried
or
who
were
passing
through
in
this
hospital
too
were
invalids
from
the
disciplinary
company
a
melancholy
institution
for
bringing
together
soldiers
of
bad
conduct
with
a
view
to
their
correction
at
the
end
of
a
year
or
two
they
come
back
the
most
rascals
that
the
earth
can
endure
when
a
convict
felt
that
he
was
ill
he
told
the
officer
who
wrote
the
man
name
down
on
a
card
which
he
then
gave
to
him
and
sent
him
to
the
hospital
under
the
escort
of
a
soldier
on
his
arrival
he
was
examined
by
a
doctor
who
authorised
the
convict
to
remain
at
the
hospital
if
he
was
really
my
name
was
duly
written
down
and
towards
one
when
all
my
companions
had
started
for
their
afternoon
work
i
went
to
the
hospital
every
prisoner
took
with
him
such
money
and
bread
as
he
could
for
food
was
not
to
be
expected
the
first
day
a
little
pipe
and
pouch
containing
tobacco
with
flint
steel
and
the
convicts
concealed
these
objects
in
their
boots
on
entering
the
hospital
i
experienced
a
feeling
of
curiosity
for
a
new
aspect
of
life
was
now
presented
the
day
was
hot
cloudy
sad
one
of
those
days
when
places
like
a
hospital
assume
a
particularly
disagreeable
and
repulsive
look
myself
and
the
soldier
escorting
me
went
into
the
entrance
room
where
there
were
two
copper
baths
there
were
two
convicts
waiting
there
with
their
warders
an
assistant
surgeon
came
in
looked
at
us
with
a
careless
and
patronising
air
and
went
away
still
more
carelessly
to
announce
our
arrival
to
the
physician
on
duty
soon
the
physician
arrived
he
examined
me
treating
me
in
a
very
affable
manner
and
gave
me
a
paper
on
which
my
name
was
inscribed
the
ordinary
physician
of
the
wards
reserved
for
the
convicts
was
to
make
the
diagnosis
of
my
illness
to
prescribe
the
fitting
remedies
together
with
the
necessary
diet
i
had
already
heard
the
convicts
say
that
their
doctors
could
not
be
too
much
praised
they
are
fathers
to
us
they
would
say
i
took
my
clothes
off
to
put
on
another
costume
our
clothes
and
linen
were
taken
away
and
we
were
given
hospital
linen
instead
to
which
were
added
long
stockings
slippers
cotton
nightcaps
and
a
of
a
very
thick
brown
cloth
which
was
lined
not
with
linen
but
with
filth
the
was
indeed
very
filthy
but
i
soon
understood
its
utility
we
were
afterwards
taken
to
the
convict
wards
which
were
at
the
head
of
a
long
corridor
very
high
and
very
clean
the
external
cleanliness
was
quite
satisfactory
everything
that
could
be
seen
shone
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
after
the
dirtiness
of
the
convict
prison
the
two
prisoners
whom
i
had
found
in
the
entrance
hall
went
to
the
left
of
the
corridor
while
i
entered
a
room
before
the
padlocked
door
walked
a
sentinel
musket
on
shoulder
and
not
far
off
was
the
soldier
who
was
to
replace
him
the
sergeant
of
the
hospital
guard
ordered
him
to
let
me
pass
and
suddenly
i
found
myself
in
the
middle
of
a
long
narrow
room
with
beds
to
the
number
of
arranged
against
the
walls
three
or
four
of
them
were
still
unoccupied
these
wooden
beds
were
painted
green
and
as
is
notoriously
the
case
with
all
hospital
beds
in
russia
were
doubtless
inhabited
by
bugs
i
went
into
a
corner
by
the
side
of
the
windows
there
were
very
few
prisoners
dangerously
ill
and
confined
to
their
beds
the
inmates
of
the
hospital
were
for
the
most
part
convalescents
or
men
who
were
slightly
indisposed
my
new
companions
were
stretched
out
on
their
couches
or
walking
about
up
and
down
between
the
rows
of
beds
there
was
just
space
enough
for
them
to
come
and
go
the
atmosphere
of
the
ward
was
stifling
with
the
odour
peculiar
to
hospitals
it
was
composed
of
various
emanations
each
more
disagreeable
than
the
other
and
of
the
smell
of
drugs
though
the
stove
was
kept
well
heated
all
day
long
my
bed
was
covered
with
a
counterpane
which
i
took
off
the
bed
itself
consisted
of
a
cloth
blanket
lined
with
linen
and
coarse
sheets
of
more
than
doubtful
cleanliness
by
the
side
of
the
bed
was
a
little
table
with
a
pitcher
and
a
pewter
mug
together
with
a
diminutive
napkin
which
had
been
given
to
me
the
table
could
moreover
hold
a
for
those
patients
who
were
rich
enough
to
drink
tea
these
men
of
means
however
were
not
very
numerous
the
pipes
and
the
tobacco
pouches
for
all
the
patients
smoked
even
the
consumptive
ones
could
be
concealed
beneath
the
mattress
the
doctors
and
the
other
officials
scarcely
ever
made
searches
and
when
they
surprised
a
patient
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
they
pretended
not
to
see
the
patients
however
were
very
prudent
and
smoked
always
at
the
back
of
the
stove
they
never
smoked
in
their
beds
except
at
night
when
no
rounds
were
made
by
the
officers
commanding
the
hospital
until
then
i
had
not
been
in
any
hospital
in
the
character
of
patient
so
that
everything
was
quite
new
to
me
i
noticed
that
my
entry
had
mystified
some
of
the
prisoners
they
had
heard
of
me
and
all
the
inmates
now
looked
upon
me
with
that
slight
shade
of
superiority
which
recognised
members
of
no
matter
what
society
show
to
one
newly
admitted
among
them
on
my
right
was
lying
down
a
man
committed
for
trial
an
and
the
illegitimate
son
of
a
retired
captain
accused
of
having
made
false
money
he
had
been
in
the
hospital
nearly
a
year
he
was
not
in
the
least
ill
but
he
assured
the
doctors
that
he
had
an
aneurism
and
he
so
thoroughly
convinced
them
that
he
escaped
both
the
hard
labour
and
the
corporal
punishment
to
which
he
had
been
sentenced
he
was
sent
a
year
later
to
t
k
where
he
was
attached
to
an
asylum
he
was
a
vigorous
young
fellow
of
cunning
a
rogue
and
something
of
a
lawyer
he
was
intelligent
had
easy
manners
but
was
very
presumptuous
and
suffered
from
morbid
convinced
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
a
bit
more
honest
or
more
just
than
himself
he
did
not
consider
himself
at
all
guilty
and
never
kept
this
assurance
to
himself
this
personage
was
the
first
to
address
me
and
he
questioned
me
with
much
curiosity
he
initiated
me
into
the
ways
of
the
hospital
and
of
course
began
by
telling
me
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
captain
he
was
very
anxious
that
i
should
take
him
for
a
noble
or
at
least
for
some
one
connected
with
the
nobility
soon
afterwards
an
invalid
from
the
disciplinary
company
came
and
told
me
that
he
knew
a
great
many
nobles
who
had
been
exiled
and
to
convince
me
he
repeated
to
me
their
christian
names
and
their
patronymics
it
was
only
necessary
to
see
the
face
of
this
soldier
to
understand
that
he
was
lying
abominably
he
was
named
tchekounoff
and
came
to
pay
court
to
me
because
he
suspected
me
of
having
money
when
he
saw
a
packet
of
tea
and
sugar
he
at
once
offered
me
his
services
to
make
the
water
boil
and
to
get
me
a
k
had
promised
to
send
me
my
own
by
one
of
the
prisoners
who
worked
in
the
hospital
but
tchekounoff
arranged
to
get
me
one
forthwith
he
got
me
a
tin
vessel
in
which
he
made
the
water
boil
and
in
a
word
he
showed
such
extraordinary
zeal
that
it
drew
down
upon
him
bitter
laughter
from
one
of
the
patients
a
consumptive
man
whose
bed
was
just
opposite
mine
usteantseff
by
name
this
was
the
soldier
condemned
to
the
rods
who
from
fear
had
swallowed
a
bottle
of
vodka
in
which
he
had
infused
tobacco
this
bringing
on
lung
disease
i
have
spoken
of
him
above
he
had
remained
silent
until
now
stretched
out
on
his
bed
and
breathing
with
difficulty
he
looked
at
me
all
the
time
with
a
very
serious
air
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
tchekounoff
whose
civility
irritated
him
his
extraordinary
gravity
rendered
his
indignation
comic
at
last
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
look
at
this
fellow
he
has
found
his
master
he
said
stammering
out
the
words
with
a
voice
strangled
by
weakness
for
he
had
now
not
long
to
live
tchekounoff
much
annoyed
turned
round
who
is
the
fellow
he
asked
looking
at
usteantseff
with
contempt
why
you
are
a
flunkey
replied
usteantseff
as
confidently
as
if
he
had
possessed
the
right
of
calling
tchekounoff
to
order
i
a
fellow
yes
you
are
a
flunkey
a
true
flunkey
listen
my
good
friends
he
wo
believe
me
he
is
quite
astonished
the
brave
fellow
what
can
that
matter
to
you
you
see
when
they
do
know
how
to
make
use
of
their
hands
that
they
are
not
accustomed
to
be
without
servants
why
should
i
not
serve
him
buffoon
with
a
hairy
snout
who
has
a
hairy
snout
you
i
have
a
hairy
snout
yes
certainly
you
have
you
are
a
nice
fellow
you
are
if
i
have
a
hairy
snout
you
have
a
face
like
a
crow
egg
hairy
snout
the
merciful
lord
has
settled
your
account
you
would
do
much
better
to
keep
quiet
and
die
why
i
would
rather
prostrate
myself
before
a
boot
than
before
a
slipper
my
father
never
prostrated
himself
and
never
made
me
do
so
he
would
have
continued
but
an
attack
of
coughing
convulsed
him
for
some
minutes
he
spat
blood
and
a
cold
sweat
broke
out
on
his
low
forehead
if
his
cough
had
not
prevented
him
from
speaking
he
would
have
continued
to
declaim
one
could
see
that
from
his
look
but
in
his
powerlessness
he
could
only
move
his
hand
the
result
of
which
was
that
tchekounoff
spoke
no
more
about
the
matter
i
quite
understood
that
the
consumptive
patient
hated
me
much
more
than
tchekounoff
no
one
would
have
thought
of
being
angry
with
him
or
of
looking
down
upon
him
by
reason
of
the
services
he
was
rendering
me
and
the
few
kopecks
that
he
tried
to
get
from
me
every
one
understood
that
he
did
it
all
in
order
to
get
himself
a
little
money
the
russian
people
are
not
at
all
susceptible
on
such
points
and
know
perfectly
well
how
to
take
them
i
had
displeased
usteantseff
as
my
tea
had
also
displeased
him
what
irritated
him
was
that
in
spite
of
all
i
was
a
gentleman
even
with
my
chains
that
i
could
not
do
without
a
servant
though
i
neither
asked
for
nor
desired
one
in
reality
i
tried
to
do
everything
for
myself
in
order
not
to
appear
a
effeminate
person
and
not
to
play
the
part
which
excited
so
much
envy
i
even
felt
a
little
pride
on
this
point
but
in
spite
of
every
thing
i
do
not
know
why
i
was
always
surrounded
by
officious
complaisant
people
who
attached
themselves
to
me
of
their
own
free
will
and
who
ended
by
governing
me
it
was
i
rather
who
was
their
servant
so
that
whether
i
liked
it
or
not
i
was
made
to
appear
to
every
one
a
noble
who
could
not
do
without
the
services
of
others
and
who
gave
himself
airs
this
exasperated
me
usteantseff
was
consumptive
and
therefore
irascible
the
other
patients
only
showed
me
indifference
tinged
with
a
shade
of
contempt
they
were
occupied
with
a
circumstance
which
now
presents
itself
to
my
memory
i
learned
as
i
listened
to
their
conversation
that
there
was
to
be
brought
into
the
hospital
that
evening
a
convict
who
at
that
moment
was
receiving
the
rods
the
prisoners
were
looking
forward
to
this
new
arrival
with
some
curiosity
they
said
however
that
his
punishment
was
but
slight
only
five
hundred
strokes
i
looked
round
the
greater
number
of
genuine
patients
were
as
far
as
i
could
observe
affected
by
scurvy
and
diseases
of
the
eyes
both
peculiar
to
this
country
the
others
suffered
from
fever
lung
disease
and
other
illnesses
the
different
illnesses
were
not
separated
all
the
patients
were
together
in
the
same
room
i
have
spoken
of
genuine
patients
for
certain
convicts
had
come
in
merely
to
get
a
little
rest
the
doctors
admitted
them
from
pure
compassion
above
all
if
there
were
any
vacant
beds
life
in
the
and
in
the
prison
was
so
hard
compared
with
that
of
the
hospital
that
many
persons
preferred
to
remain
lying
down
in
spite
of
the
stifling
atmosphere
and
the
rules
against
leaving
the
room
there
were
even
men
who
took
pleasure
in
this
kind
of
life
they
belonged
nearly
all
to
the
disciplinary
company
i
examined
my
new
companions
with
curiosity
one
of
them
puzzled
me
very
much
he
was
consumptive
and
was
dying
his
bed
was
a
little
further
on
than
that
of
usteantseff
and
was
nearly
beside
mine
he
was
named
mikhailoff
i
had
seen
him
in
the
convict
prison
two
weeks
before
when
he
was
already
seriously
ill
he
ought
to
have
been
under
treatment
long
before
but
he
bore
up
against
his
malady
with
surprising
courage
he
did
not
go
to
the
hospital
until
about
the
christmas
holidays
to
die
three
weeks
afterwards
of
galloping
consumption
he
seemed
to
have
burned
out
like
a
candle
what
astonished
me
most
was
the
terrible
change
in
his
countenance
i
had
noticed
him
the
very
first
day
of
my
imprisonment
by
his
side
was
lying
a
soldier
of
the
disciplinary
company
an
old
man
with
a
bad
expression
on
his
face
whose
general
appearance
was
disgusting
but
i
am
not
going
to
enumerate
all
the
patients
i
just
remember
this
old
man
simply
because
he
made
an
impression
on
me
and
initiated
me
at
once
into
certain
peculiarities
of
the
ward
he
had
a
severe
cold
in
the
head
which
made
him
sneeze
at
every
moment
even
during
his
sleep
as
if
firing
salutes
five
or
six
times
running
while
each
time
he
called
out
my
god
what
torture
seated
on
his
bed
he
stuffed
his
nose
eagerly
with
snuff
which
he
took
from
a
paper
bag
in
order
to
sneeze
more
strongly
and
with
greater
regularity
he
sneezed
into
a
checked
cotton
which
belonged
to
him
and
which
had
lost
its
colour
through
perpetual
washing
his
little
nose
then
became
wrinkled
in
a
most
peculiar
manner
with
a
multitude
of
wrinkles
and
his
open
mouth
exhibited
broken
teeth
decayed
and
black
and
red
gums
moist
with
saliva
when
he
sneezed
into
his
handkerchief
he
unfolded
it
and
wiped
it
on
the
lining
of
his
his
proceedings
disgusted
me
so
much
that
involuntarily
i
examined
the
i
had
just
put
on
myself
it
exhaled
a
most
offensive
odour
which
contact
with
my
body
helped
to
bring
out
it
smelt
of
plasters
and
medicaments
of
all
kinds
it
seemed
as
though
it
had
been
worn
by
patients
from
time
immemorial
the
lining
had
perhaps
been
washed
once
but
i
would
not
swear
to
it
certainly
at
the
time
i
put
it
on
it
was
saturated
with
lotions
and
stained
by
contact
with
poultices
and
plasters
of
all
imaginable
kinds
the
men
condemned
to
the
rods
having
undergone
their
punishment
were
brought
straight
to
the
hospital
their
backs
still
bleeding
as
compresses
and
as
poultices
were
placed
on
their
wounds
the
they
wore
over
their
wet
shirt
received
and
retained
the
droppings
during
all
the
time
of
my
hard
labour
i
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
which
often
happened
i
always
put
on
with
mistrust
and
abhorrence
the
that
was
delivered
to
me
as
soon
as
tchekounoff
had
given
me
my
tea
i
will
say
in
parenthesis
that
the
water
brought
in
in
the
morning
and
not
renewed
throughout
the
day
was
soon
corrupted
soon
poisoned
by
the
fetid
air
the
door
opened
and
the
soldier
who
had
just
received
the
rods
was
brought
in
under
a
double
escort
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
man
who
had
just
been
whipped
later
on
many
were
brought
in
and
whenever
this
happened
it
caused
great
distress
to
the
patients
these
unfortunate
men
were
received
with
grave
composure
but
the
nature
of
the
reception
depended
nearly
always
on
the
enormity
of
the
crime
committed
and
consequently
the
number
of
strokes
administered
the
criminals
most
cruelly
whipped
and
who
were
celebrated
as
brigands
of
the
first
order
enjoyed
more
respect
and
attention
than
a
simple
deserter
a
recruit
like
the
one
who
had
just
been
brought
in
but
in
neither
case
was
any
particular
sympathy
manifested
nor
were
any
annoying
remarks
made
the
unhappy
man
was
attended
to
in
silence
above
all
if
he
was
incapable
of
attending
to
himself
the
knew
that
they
were
entrusting
their
patients
to
skilful
and
experienced
hands
the
usual
treatment
consisted
in
applying
very
often
to
the
back
of
the
man
who
had
been
whipped
a
shirt
or
a
piece
of
linen
steeped
in
cold
water
it
was
also
necessary
to
withdraw
skilfully
from
the
wounds
the
twigs
left
by
the
rods
which
had
been
broken
on
the
criminal
back
this
last
operation
was
particularly
painful
to
the
patients
the
extraordinary
stoicism
with
which
they
supported
their
sufferings
astonished
me
greatly
i
have
seen
many
convicts
who
had
been
whipped
and
cruelly
i
can
tell
you
well
i
do
not
remember
one
of
them
uttering
a
groan
only
after
such
an
experience
the
countenance
becomes
pale
decomposed
the
eyes
glitter
the
look
wanders
and
the
lips
tremble
so
that
the
patient
sometimes
bites
them
till
they
bleed
the
soldier
who
had
just
come
in
was
years
of
age
he
had
a
good
muscular
development
and
was
rather
a
fine
man
tall
with
a
bronzed
skin
his
back
uncovered
down
to
the
waist
had
been
seriously
beaten
and
his
body
now
trembled
with
fever
beneath
the
damp
sheet
with
which
his
back
was
covered
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
he
did
nothing
but
walk
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
room
i
looked
at
his
face
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
nothing
his
eyes
had
a
strange
expression
at
once
wild
and
timid
they
seemed
to
fix
themselves
with
difficulty
on
the
various
objects
i
fancied
i
saw
him
looking
attentively
at
my
hot
tea
the
steam
was
rising
from
the
full
cup
and
the
poor
devil
was
shivering
and
clattering
his
teeth
i
invited
him
to
have
some
he
turned
towards
me
without
saying
a
word
and
taking
up
the
cup
swallowed
the
tea
at
one
gulp
without
putting
sugar
in
it
he
tried
not
to
look
at
me
and
when
he
had
finished
he
put
the
cup
back
in
silence
without
making
a
sign
and
then
began
to
walk
up
and
down
as
before
he
was
in
too
much
pain
to
think
of
speaking
to
me
or
thanking
me
as
for
the
other
prisoners
they
abstained
from
questioning
him
when
once
they
had
applied
compresses
they
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
thinking
probably
it
would
be
better
to
leave
him
alone
and
not
to
worry
him
by
their
questions
and
compassion
the
soldier
seemed
quite
satisfied
with
this
view
meanwhile
night
came
on
and
the
lamp
was
lighted
some
of
the
patients
possessed
candlesticks
of
their
own
but
these
were
not
numerous
in
the
evening
the
doctor
came
round
after
which
a
officer
on
guard
counted
the
patients
and
closed
the
room
the
prisoners
could
not
speak
in
too
high
terms
of
their
doctors
they
looked
upon
them
truly
as
fathers
and
respected
them
these
doctors
had
always
something
pleasant
to
say
a
kind
word
even
for
reprobates
who
appreciated
it
all
the
more
because
they
knew
it
was
said
in
all
sincerity
yes
these
kind
words
were
really
sincere
for
no
one
would
have
thought
of
blaming
the
doctors
had
they
shown
themselves
cross
and
inhuman
they
were
kind
purely
from
humanity
they
understood
perfectly
that
a
convict
who
is
sick
has
as
much
right
to
breathe
pure
air
as
any
other
person
even
though
the
latter
might
be
a
great
personage
the
convalescents
there
had
a
right
to
walk
freely
through
the
corridors
to
take
exercise
and
to
breathe
air
less
pestilential
than
that
of
our
infirmary
which
was
close
and
saturated
with
deleterious
emanations
in
our
ward
when
once
the
doors
had
been
closed
in
the
evening
they
had
to
remain
closed
throughout
the
night
and
under
no
pretext
was
one
of
the
inmates
allowed
to
go
out
for
many
years
an
inexplicable
fact
troubled
me
like
an
insoluble
problem
i
must
speak
of
it
before
going
on
with
my
description
i
am
thinking
of
the
chains
which
every
convict
is
obliged
to
wear
however
ill
he
may
be
even
consumptives
have
died
beneath
my
eyes
with
their
legs
loaded
with
irons
everybody
was
accustomed
to
it
and
regarded
it
as
an
inevitable
fact
i
do
not
think
any
one
even
the
doctors
would
have
thought
of
demanding
the
removal
of
the
irons
from
convicts
who
were
seriously
ill
not
even
from
the
consumptive
ones
the
chains
it
is
true
were
not
exceedingly
heavy
they
did
not
in
general
weigh
more
than
eight
or
ten
pounds
which
is
a
supportable
burden
for
a
man
in
good
health
i
have
been
told
however
that
after
some
years
the
legs
of
the
convicts
dry
up
and
waste
away
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
true
i
am
inclined
to
think
it
is
the
weight
however
light
it
may
be
say
not
more
than
ten
pounds
if
it
is
fixed
to
the
leg
for
ever
increases
the
general
weight
in
an
abnormal
manner
and
at
the
end
of
a
certain
time
must
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
its
development
for
a
convict
in
good
health
this
is
nothing
but
the
same
can
not
be
said
of
one
who
is
sick
for
the
convicts
who
were
seriously
ill
for
the
consumptive
ones
whose
arms
and
legs
dry
up
of
themselves
this
last
straw
is
insupportable
even
if
the
medical
authorities
claimed
alleviation
for
the
consumptive
patients
alone
it
would
be
an
immense
benefit
i
assure
you
i
shall
be
told
convicts
are
malefactors
unworthy
of
compassion
but
ought
increased
severity
to
be
shown
towards
him
on
whom
the
finger
of
god
already
weighs
no
one
will
believe
that
the
object
of
this
aggravation
is
to
reform
the
criminal
the
consumptive
prisoners
are
exempted
from
corporal
punishment
by
the
tribunal
there
must
be
some
mysterious
important
reason
for
all
this
but
what
it
is
it
is
impossible
to
understand
no
one
believes
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
a
consumptive
man
will
run
away
who
can
think
of
such
a
thing
especially
if
the
illness
has
reached
a
certain
degree
of
intensity
it
is
impossible
to
deceive
the
doctors
and
make
them
mistake
a
convict
in
good
health
for
one
who
is
in
a
consumption
for
this
malady
is
one
that
can
be
recognised
at
the
first
glance
moreover
can
the
irons
prevent
the
convict
not
in
good
health
from
escaping
not
in
the
least
the
irons
are
a
degradation
and
shame
a
physical
and
moral
burden
but
they
would
not
hinder
any
one
attempting
to
escape
the
most
awkward
and
least
intelligent
convict
can
saw
through
them
or
break
the
rivets
by
hammering
at
them
with
a
stone
chains
then
are
a
useless
precaution
and
if
the
convicts
wear
them
as
a
punishment
should
not
this
punishment
be
spared
to
dying
men
as
i
write
these
lines
a
face
stands
out
from
my
memory
that
of
a
dying
man
a
man
who
died
in
consumption
this
same
mikhailoff
whose
bed
was
nearly
opposite
me
and
who
expired
i
think
four
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
hospital
when
i
spoke
above
of
the
consumptive
patients
i
was
only
reproducing
involuntarily
the
sensations
and
ideas
which
occurred
to
me
on
the
occasion
of
this
death
i
knew
mikhailoff
very
little
he
was
a
young
man
of
at
most
not
very
tall
thin
and
with
a
fine
face
he
belonged
to
the
special
section
and
was
remarkable
for
his
strange
but
soft
and
sad
taciturnity
he
seemed
to
have
dried
up
in
the
convict
prison
to
use
an
expression
employed
by
the
convicts
who
had
a
good
recollection
of
him
i
remember
he
had
very
fine
eyes
i
really
can
not
tell
why
i
think
of
that
he
died
at
three
in
the
afternoon
on
a
clear
dry
day
the
sun
was
darting
its
brilliant
rays
obliquely
through
the
greenish
frozen
panes
of
our
room
a
torrent
of
light
inundated
the
unhappy
patient
who
had
lost
all
consciousness
and
was
several
hours
dying
from
the
early
morning
his
sight
became
confused
he
was
unable
to
recognise
those
who
approached
him
the
convicts
would
gladly
have
done
anything
to
relieve
him
for
they
saw
he
was
in
great
suffering
his
respiration
was
painful
deep
and
irregular
his
breast
rose
and
fell
violently
as
though
he
were
in
want
of
air
he
cast
his
blanket
and
his
clothes
far
from
him
then
he
began
to
tear
up
his
shirt
which
seemed
to
him
a
terrible
burden
it
was
taken
off
then
it
was
frightful
to
see
this
immensely
long
body
with
fleshless
arms
and
legs
with
beating
breast
and
ribs
which
were
as
clearly
marked
as
those
of
a
skeleton
there
was
nothing
now
on
this
skeleton
but
a
cross
and
the
irons
from
which
his
legs
might
easily
have
freed
themselves
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
his
death
everything
was
silent
in
our
ward
and
the
inmates
spoke
only
in
whispers
the
convicts
walked
on
the
tips
of
their
toes
from
time
to
time
they
exchanged
remarks
on
other
subjects
and
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
the
dying
man
the
rattling
in
his
throat
grew
more
and
more
painful
at
last
with
a
trembling
hand
he
felt
the
cross
on
his
breast
and
endeavoured
to
tear
it
off
it
was
also
weighing
upon
him
suffocating
him
it
was
taken
off
ten
minutes
afterwards
he
died
some
one
then
knocked
at
the
door
in
order
to
give
notice
to
the
sentinel
the
warder
entered
looked
at
the
dead
man
with
a
vacant
air
and
went
away
to
get
the
the
was
a
good
fellow
enough
but
a
little
too
much
occupied
with
his
personal
appearance
otherwise
very
agreeable
he
soon
arrived
went
up
to
the
corpse
with
long
strides
which
made
a
noise
in
the
silent
ward
and
felt
the
dead
man
pulse
with
an
unconcerned
air
which
seemed
to
have
been
put
on
for
the
occasion
he
then
made
a
vague
gesture
with
his
hand
and
went
out
information
was
given
at
the
for
the
criminal
was
an
important
one
he
belonged
to
the
special
section
and
in
order
to
register
his
death
it
was
necessary
to
go
through
some
formalities
while
we
were
waiting
for
the
hospital
guard
to
come
one
of
the
prisoners
said
in
a
whisper
the
eyes
of
the
defunct
might
as
well
be
closed
another
one
profited
by
this
remark
and
approaching
mikhailoff
in
silence
closed
his
eyes
then
perceiving
on
the
pillow
the
cross
which
had
been
taken
from
his
neck
he
took
it
and
looked
at
it
put
it
down
and
crossed
himself
the
face
of
the
dead
man
was
becoming
ossified
a
ray
of
white
light
was
playing
on
the
surface
and
illuminated
two
rows
of
white
good
teeth
which
sparkled
between
his
thin
lips
glued
to
the
gums
by
the
mouth
the
officer
on
guard
arrived
at
last
musket
on
shoulder
helmet
on
head
accompanied
by
two
soldiers
he
approached
the
corpse
slackening
his
pace
with
an
air
of
uncertainty
then
he
examined
with
a
side
glance
the
silent
prisoners
who
looked
at
him
with
a
sombre
expression
at
one
step
from
the
dead
man
he
stopped
short
as
if
suddenly
nailed
to
the
spot
the
naked
body
loaded
with
irons
had
impressed
him
he
undid
his
removed
his
helmet
which
was
not
at
all
necessary
for
him
to
do
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
he
had
a
gray
head
the
head
of
a
soldier
who
had
seen
much
service
i
remember
that
by
his
side
stood
tchekounoff
an
old
man
who
was
also
gray
he
looked
all
the
time
at
the
officer
and
followed
all
his
movements
with
strange
attention
they
glanced
across
and
i
saw
that
tchekounoff
also
trembled
he
bit
and
closed
his
teeth
and
said
to
the
officer
as
if
involuntarily
at
the
same
time
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
dead
man
he
had
a
mother
too
these
words
went
to
my
heart
why
had
he
said
them
and
how
did
this
idea
occur
to
him
the
corpse
was
raised
with
the
mattress
the
straw
creaked
the
chains
dragged
along
the
ground
with
a
sharp
ring
they
were
taken
up
and
the
body
was
carried
out
suddenly
all
spoke
once
more
in
a
loud
voice
the
officer
in
the
corridor
could
well
be
heard
crying
out
to
some
one
to
go
for
the
blacksmith
it
was
necessary
to
take
the
dead
man
irons
off
but
i
have
digressed
from
my
subject
chapter
ii
the
hospital
the
doctors
used
to
visit
the
wards
in
the
morning
towards
eleven
they
appeared
all
together
forming
a
procession
which
was
headed
by
the
chief
physician
an
hour
and
a
half
before
the
ordinary
physician
had
made
his
round
he
was
a
quiet
young
man
always
affable
and
kind
much
liked
by
the
prisoners
and
thoroughly
versed
in
his
art
they
only
found
one
fault
with
him
that
he
was
too
soft
he
was
in
fact
by
no
means
communicative
he
seemed
confused
in
our
presence
blushed
sometimes
and
changed
the
quantity
of
food
at
the
first
representation
of
the
patient
i
think
he
would
have
consented
to
give
them
any
medicine
they
desired
in
other
respects
an
excellent
young
man
a
doctor
in
russia
often
enjoys
the
affection
and
respect
of
the
people
and
with
reason
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
see
i
know
that
my
words
would
seem
a
paradox
above
all
when
the
mistrust
of
this
same
people
for
foreign
drugs
and
foreign
doctors
is
taken
into
account
in
fact
they
prefer
even
when
suffering
from
a
serious
illness
to
address
themselves
year
after
year
to
a
witch
or
employ
old
women
remedies
which
however
ought
not
to
be
despised
rather
than
consult
a
doctor
or
go
into
the
hospital
in
truth
these
prejudices
may
be
above
all
attributed
to
causes
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
medicine
namely
the
mistrust
of
the
people
for
anything
which
bears
an
official
and
administrative
character
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
that
the
common
people
are
frightened
and
prejudiced
in
regard
to
the
hospitals
by
the
stories
often
absurd
of
fantastic
horrors
said
to
take
place
within
them
perhaps
however
these
stories
have
a
basis
of
truth
but
what
repels
them
above
all
is
the
germanism
of
the
hospitals
the
idea
that
during
their
illness
they
will
be
attended
to
by
foreigners
the
severity
of
the
diet
the
heartlessness
of
the
surgeons
and
doctors
the
dissection
and
autopsy
of
the
bodies
etc
the
common
people
reflect
moreover
that
they
will
be
attended
by
nobles
for
in
their
view
the
doctors
belong
to
the
nobility
once
they
have
made
acquaintance
with
them
there
are
exceptions
no
doubt
but
they
are
rare
their
fears
vanish
this
success
must
be
attributed
to
our
doctors
especially
the
young
ones
who
for
the
most
part
know
how
to
gain
the
respect
and
affection
of
the
people
i
speak
now
of
what
i
myself
have
seen
and
experienced
in
many
cases
and
in
different
parts
and
i
think
matters
are
the
same
everywhere
in
some
distant
localities
the
doctors
receive
presents
make
profit
out
of
their
hospitals
and
neglect
the
patients
sometimes
they
forget
even
their
art
this
happens
no
doubt
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
majority
inspired
as
it
is
by
that
spirit
that
generous
tendency
which
is
regenerating
the
medical
art
as
for
the
apostates
the
wolves
in
the
they
may
excuse
themselves
and
cast
the
blame
on
the
circumstances
amid
which
they
live
but
they
are
absurd
inexcusable
especially
if
they
are
no
longer
humane
it
is
precisely
the
humanity
affability
and
brotherly
compassion
of
the
doctor
which
prove
most
efficacious
remedies
for
the
patients
it
is
time
to
stop
these
apathetic
lamentations
on
the
circumstances
surrounding
us
there
may
be
truth
in
the
lament
but
a
cunning
rogue
who
knows
how
to
take
care
of
himself
never
fails
to
blame
the
circumstances
around
him
when
he
wishes
his
faults
to
be
forgiven
above
all
if
he
writes
or
speaks
with
eloquence
i
have
again
departed
from
my
subject
i
wish
only
to
say
that
the
common
people
mistrust
and
dislike
officialism
and
the
government
doctors
rather
than
the
doctors
themselves
but
on
personal
acquaintance
many
prejudices
disappear
our
doctor
generally
stopped
before
the
bed
of
each
patient
questioned
him
seriously
and
attentively
then
prescribed
the
remedies
potions
etc
he
sometimes
noticed
that
the
pretended
invalid
was
not
ill
at
all
he
had
come
to
take
rest
after
his
hard
work
and
to
sleep
on
a
mattress
in
a
warm
room
far
preferable
to
the
naked
planks
in
a
damp
among
a
mass
of
pale
men
waiting
for
their
trial
in
russia
the
prisoners
in
the
house
of
detention
are
almost
always
broken
down
which
shows
that
their
moral
and
material
condition
is
worse
even
than
those
of
the
convicts
in
cases
of
feigned
sickness
our
doctor
would
describe
the
patient
as
suffering
from
and
sometimes
allowed
him
to
remain
a
week
in
the
hospital
every
one
laughed
at
this
for
it
was
known
to
be
a
formula
agreed
upon
between
the
doctor
and
the
patient
to
indicate
no
malady
at
all
often
the
robust
invalid
who
abused
the
doctor
compassion
remained
in
the
hospital
until
he
was
turned
out
by
force
our
doctor
was
worth
seeing
then
confused
by
the
prisoner
obstinacy
he
did
not
like
to
tell
him
plainly
that
he
was
cured
and
offer
him
his
leaving
ticket
although
he
had
the
right
to
send
him
away
without
the
least
explanation
on
writing
the
words
first
he
would
hint
to
him
that
it
was
time
to
go
and
then
would
beg
him
to
leave
you
must
go
you
know
you
are
cured
now
and
we
have
no
place
for
you
we
are
very
much
cramped
here
etc
at
last
ashamed
to
remain
any
longer
the
patient
would
consent
to
go
the
although
compassionate
and
just
the
patients
were
much
attached
to
him
was
incomparably
more
severe
and
more
decided
than
our
ordinary
physician
in
certain
cases
he
showed
merciless
severity
which
only
gained
for
him
the
respect
of
the
convicts
he
always
came
into
the
room
accompanied
by
all
the
doctors
of
the
hospital
when
his
assistants
visited
all
the
beds
and
diagnosed
on
each
particular
case
he
stopped
longest
at
the
beds
of
those
who
were
seriously
ill
and
had
an
encouraging
word
for
them
he
never
sent
back
the
convicts
who
arrived
with
but
if
one
of
them
was
determined
to
remain
in
the
hospital
he
certified
that
the
man
was
cured
come
he
would
say
you
have
had
your
rest
now
go
you
must
not
take
liberties
those
who
insisted
upon
remaining
were
above
all
the
convicts
who
were
worn
out
by
field
labour
performed
during
the
great
summer
heat
or
prisoners
who
had
been
sentenced
to
be
whipped
i
remember
that
they
were
obliged
to
be
particularly
severe
merely
in
order
to
get
rid
of
one
of
them
he
had
come
to
be
cured
of
some
disease
of
the
eyes
which
were
red
all
over
he
complained
of
suffering
a
sharp
pain
in
the
eyelids
he
was
incurable
plasters
blisters
leeches
nothing
did
him
any
good
and
the
diseased
organ
remained
in
the
same
condition
then
it
occurred
to
the
doctors
that
the
illness
was
feigned
for
the
inflammation
neither
became
worse
nor
better
and
they
soon
understood
that
a
comedy
was
being
played
although
the
patient
would
not
admit
it
he
was
a
fine
young
fellow
not
though
he
produced
a
disagreeable
impression
upon
all
his
companions
he
was
suspicious
sombre
full
of
dissimulation
and
never
looked
any
one
straight
in
the
face
he
also
kept
himself
apart
as
if
he
mistrusted
us
all
i
remember
that
many
persons
were
afraid
that
he
would
do
some
one
harm
when
he
was
a
soldier
he
had
committed
some
small
theft
he
had
been
arrested
and
condemned
to
receive
a
thousand
strokes
and
afterwards
to
pass
into
a
disciplinary
company
to
put
off
the
moment
of
punishment
the
prisoners
as
i
have
already
said
will
do
incredible
things
on
the
eve
of
the
fatal
day
they
will
stick
a
knife
into
one
of
their
chiefs
or
into
a
comrade
in
order
that
they
may
be
tried
again
for
this
new
offence
which
will
delay
their
punishment
for
a
month
or
two
it
matters
little
to
them
that
their
punishment
be
doubled
or
tripled
if
they
can
escape
this
time
what
they
desire
is
to
put
off
temporarily
the
terrible
minute
at
whatever
cost
so
utterly
does
their
heart
fail
them
many
of
the
patients
thought
the
man
with
the
sore
eyes
ought
to
be
watched
lest
in
his
despair
he
should
assassinate
some
one
during
the
night
but
no
precaution
was
taken
not
even
by
those
who
slept
next
to
him
it
was
remarked
however
that
he
rubbed
his
eyes
with
plaster
from
the
wall
and
with
something
else
besides
in
order
that
they
might
appear
red
when
the
doctor
came
round
at
last
the
threatened
to
cure
him
of
a
seton
when
the
malady
resists
all
ordinary
treatment
the
doctors
determine
to
try
some
heroic
however
painful
remedy
but
the
poor
devil
did
not
wish
to
get
well
he
was
either
too
obstinate
or
too
cowardly
for
however
painful
the
proposed
operation
may
be
it
can
not
be
compared
to
the
punishment
of
the
rods
the
operation
consists
in
seizing
the
patient
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
taking
up
the
skin
drawing
it
back
as
much
as
possible
and
making
in
it
a
double
incision
through
which
is
passed
a
skein
of
cotton
about
as
thick
as
the
finger
every
day
at
a
fixed
hour
this
skein
is
pulled
backwards
and
forwards
in
order
that
the
wound
may
continually
suppurate
and
may
not
heal
the
poor
devil
endured
this
torture
which
caused
him
horrible
suffering
for
several
days
at
last
he
consented
to
quit
the
hospital
in
less
than
a
day
his
eyes
became
quite
well
and
as
soon
as
his
neck
was
healed
he
was
sent
to
the
which
he
left
next
day
to
receive
the
first
thousand
strokes
painful
is
the
minute
which
precedes
such
a
punishment
so
painful
that
perhaps
i
am
wrong
in
taxing
with
cowardice
those
convicts
who
fear
it
it
must
be
terrible
for
the
convicts
to
risk
a
double
or
triple
punishment
merely
to
postpone
it
i
have
spoken
however
of
convicts
who
have
thus
wished
to
quit
the
hospital
before
the
wounds
caused
by
the
first
part
of
the
flogging
were
healed
in
order
to
receive
the
last
part
and
make
an
end
of
it
for
life
in
a
is
certainly
worse
than
in
a
convict
prison
the
habit
of
receiving
floggings
helps
in
some
cases
to
give
intrepidity
and
decision
to
convicts
those
who
have
been
often
flogged
are
hardened
both
in
body
and
mind
and
have
at
last
looked
upon
such
a
punishment
as
merely
a
disagreeable
incident
no
longer
to
be
feared
one
of
our
convicts
of
the
special
section
was
a
converted
tartar
who
was
named
alexander
or
alexandrina
as
they
called
him
in
fun
at
the
convict
prison
who
told
me
how
he
had
received
strokes
he
never
spoke
of
this
punishment
except
with
amusement
and
laughter
but
he
swore
very
seriously
that
if
he
had
not
been
brought
up
in
his
horde
from
his
most
tender
infancy
on
whipping
and
flogging
and
as
the
scars
which
covered
his
back
and
which
refused
to
disappear
were
there
to
testify
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
support
those
strokes
he
blessed
the
education
of
sticks
that
he
had
received
i
was
beaten
for
the
least
thing
alexander
petrovitch
he
said
one
evening
when
we
were
sitting
down
before
the
fire
i
was
beaten
without
reason
for
fifteen
years
as
long
as
i
can
ever
remember
and
several
times
a
day
any
one
who
liked
beat
me
so
that
at
last
it
made
no
impression
upon
me
i
do
not
know
how
it
was
he
became
a
soldier
for
perhaps
he
lied
and
had
always
been
a
deserter
and
vagabond
but
i
remember
his
telling
me
one
day
of
the
fright
he
was
seized
with
when
he
was
condemned
to
receive
strokes
for
having
killed
one
of
his
officers
i
know
that
they
will
punish
me
severely
he
said
to
himself
that
accustomed
as
i
am
to
be
whipped
i
shall
perhaps
die
on
the
spot
the
devil
strokes
is
not
a
trifle
and
then
all
my
officers
were
in
a
fearful
temper
with
me
on
account
of
this
affair
i
knew
well
that
it
would
not
be
i
even
believed
that
i
should
die
under
the
rods
i
determined
to
get
baptized
i
said
to
myself
that
perhaps
they
would
not
then
flog
me
at
any
rate
it
was
worth
trying
my
comrades
had
told
me
that
it
would
be
of
no
good
but
i
said
to
myself
knows
perhaps
they
will
pardon
me
they
will
have
more
compassion
on
a
christian
than
on
a
mohammedan
they
baptized
me
and
give
me
the
name
of
alexander
but
in
spite
of
that
i
had
to
take
my
flogging
they
did
not
let
me
off
a
single
stroke
i
was
however
very
savage
a
bit
i
said
to
myself
i
will
take
you
all
in
and
would
you
believe
it
alexander
i
did
take
them
all
in
i
knew
how
to
look
like
a
dead
man
not
that
i
appeared
altogether
without
life
but
i
looked
as
if
i
were
on
the
point
of
breathing
my
last
they
led
me
in
front
of
the
battalion
to
receive
my
first
thousand
my
skin
was
burning
i
began
to
howl
they
gave
me
my
second
thousand
and
i
said
to
myself
all
over
now
i
had
lost
my
head
my
legs
seemed
broken
so
i
fell
to
the
ground
with
the
eyes
of
a
dead
man
my
face
blue
my
mouth
full
of
froth
i
no
longer
breathed
when
the
doctor
came
he
said
i
was
on
the
point
of
death
i
was
carried
to
the
hospital
and
at
once
returned
to
life
twice
again
they
flogged
me
what
a
rage
they
were
in
i
took
them
all
in
on
each
occasion
i
received
my
third
thousand
and
died
again
on
my
word
when
they
gave
me
the
last
thousand
each
stroke
ought
to
have
counted
for
three
it
was
like
a
knife
in
my
heart
oh
how
they
did
beat
me
they
were
so
severe
with
me
oh
that
cursed
fourth
thousand
it
was
well
worth
three
firsts
put
together
if
i
had
pretended
to
be
dead
when
i
had
still
to
receive
i
think
they
would
have
finished
me
but
they
did
not
get
the
better
of
me
i
had
them
again
and
again
for
they
always
thought
it
was
all
over
with
me
and
how
could
they
have
thought
otherwise
the
doctor
was
sure
of
it
but
as
for
the
which
i
had
still
to
receive
they
might
have
struck
as
hard
as
they
liked
they
were
worth
i
only
laughed
at
them
why
because
when
i
was
a
youngster
i
had
grown
up
under
the
whip
well
i
am
well
and
alive
now
but
i
have
been
beaten
in
the
course
of
my
life
he
repeated
with
a
passive
air
as
he
brought
his
story
to
an
end
as
he
did
so
he
seemed
to
recollect
and
count
anew
the
blows
he
had
received
after
a
brief
silence
he
said
i
can
not
count
them
nor
can
any
one
else
there
are
not
figures
enough
he
looked
at
me
and
burst
into
a
laugh
so
simple
and
natural
that
i
could
not
help
smiling
in
return
do
you
know
alexander
petrovitch
when
i
dream
at
night
i
always
dream
that
i
am
being
flogged
i
dream
of
nothing
else
he
in
fact
talked
in
his
sleep
and
woke
up
the
other
prisoners
what
are
you
yelling
about
you
demon
they
would
say
to
him
this
strong
robust
fellow
short
in
stature
about
years
of
age
active
lived
on
good
terms
with
every
one
though
he
was
very
fond
of
taking
what
did
not
belong
to
him
and
afterwards
got
beaten
for
it
but
each
of
our
convicts
who
stole
got
beaten
for
their
thefts
i
will
add
to
these
remarks
that
i
was
always
surprised
at
the
extraordinary
the
absence
of
rancour
with
which
these
unhappy
men
spoke
of
their
punishment
and
of
the
chiefs
superintending
it
in
these
stories
which
often
gave
me
palpitation
of
the
heart
not
a
shadow
of
hatred
or
rancour
could
be
detected
they
laughed
at
what
they
had
suffered
like
children
it
was
not
the
same
however
with
m
tçki
when
he
told
me
of
his
punishment
as
he
was
not
a
noble
he
had
been
sentenced
to
be
flogged
he
had
never
spoken
to
me
of
it
and
when
i
asked
him
if
it
were
true
he
replied
affirmatively
in
two
brief
words
but
with
evident
suffering
and
without
looking
at
me
he
at
the
same
time
turned
red
and
when
he
raised
his
eyes
i
saw
flames
burning
in
them
while
his
lips
trembled
with
indignation
i
felt
that
he
would
not
forget
that
he
could
never
forget
this
page
of
his
history
our
companions
generally
on
the
other
hand
though
theirs
might
have
been
exceptions
looked
upon
their
adventures
with
quite
another
eye
it
is
impossible
i
sometimes
thought
that
they
can
be
conscious
of
their
guilt
and
not
acknowledge
the
justice
of
their
punishment
above
all
when
their
offences
were
against
their
companions
and
not
against
some
chief
the
greater
part
of
them
did
not
acknowledge
their
guilt
i
have
already
said
that
i
never
observed
in
them
the
least
remorse
even
when
the
crime
had
been
committed
against
people
of
their
own
station
as
for
the
crimes
committed
against
a
chief
they
did
not
even
speak
of
them
it
seems
to
me
that
for
those
cases
they
had
special
views
of
their
own
they
looked
upon
them
as
accidents
caused
by
destiny
by
fatality
into
which
they
had
fallen
unconsciously
as
the
result
of
some
extraordinary
impulse
the
convict
always
justifies
the
crimes
he
has
committed
against
his
chief
he
does
not
trouble
himself
about
the
matter
but
he
admits
that
the
chief
can
not
share
his
view
and
consequently
that
he
must
naturally
be
punished
and
then
he
will
be
quits
with
him
the
struggle
between
the
administration
and
the
prisoner
is
of
the
severest
character
on
both
sides
what
in
a
great
measure
justifies
the
criminal
in
his
own
eyes
is
his
conviction
that
the
people
among
whom
he
has
been
born
and
has
lived
will
acquit
him
he
is
certain
that
the
common
people
will
not
look
upon
him
as
a
lost
man
unless
indeed
his
crime
has
bean
committed
against
persons
of
his
own
class
against
his
brethren
he
is
quite
calm
about
that
supported
by
his
conscience
he
will
not
lose
his
moral
tranquillity
and
that
is
the
principal
thing
he
feels
himself
on
firm
ground
and
has
no
particular
hatred
for
the
knout
when
once
it
has
been
administered
to
him
he
knows
that
it
was
inevitable
and
consoles
himself
by
thinking
that
he
was
neither
the
first
nor
the
last
to
receive
it
does
the
soldier
detest
the
turk
whom
he
fights
not
in
the
least
yet
he
sabres
him
hacks
him
to
pieces
kills
him
it
must
not
be
thought
moreover
that
all
of
these
stories
were
told
with
indifference
and
in
cold
blood
when
the
name
of
jerebiatnikof
was
mentioned
it
was
always
with
indignation
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
this
officer
during
my
first
stay
in
the
hospital
only
by
the
convicts
stories
it
must
be
understood
i
afterwards
saw
him
one
day
when
he
was
commanding
the
guard
at
the
convict
prison
he
was
about
thirty
years
old
very
stout
and
very
strong
with
red
cheeks
hanging
down
on
each
side
white
teeth
and
a
formidable
laugh
one
could
see
in
a
moment
that
he
was
in
no
way
given
to
reflection
he
took
the
greatest
pleasure
in
whipping
and
flogging
when
he
had
to
superintend
the
punishment
i
must
hasten
to
say
that
the
other
officers
looked
upon
jerebiatnikof
as
a
monster
and
the
convicts
did
the
same
this
was
in
the
good
old
time
which
is
not
very
very
far
off
but
in
which
it
is
already
difficult
to
believe
executioners
delighted
in
their
office
but
generally
speaking
the
strokes
were
administered
without
enthusiasm
this
lieutenant
was
an
exception
and
he
took
a
real
pleasure
and
delight
in
punishment
he
had
a
passion
for
it
and
liked
it
for
its
own
sake
he
looked
to
this
art
for
unnatural
delights
in
order
to
tickle
and
excite
his
base
soul
a
prisoner
is
conducted
to
the
place
of
punishment
jerebiatnikof
is
the
officer
superintending
the
execution
arranging
a
long
line
of
soldiers
armed
with
heavy
rods
he
walks
along
the
front
with
a
satisfied
air
and
encourages
each
one
to
do
his
duty
conscientiously
or
otherwise
the
soldiers
know
before
what
otherwise
means
the
criminal
is
brought
out
if
he
does
not
yet
know
jerebiatnikof
if
he
is
not
in
the
secret
of
the
mystery
the
lieutenant
plays
him
the
following
trick
one
of
the
inventions
of
jerebiatnikof
very
ingenious
in
this
style
of
thing
the
prisoner
whose
back
has
been
bared
and
whom
the
officers
have
fastened
to
the
butt
end
of
a
musket
in
order
to
drag
him
afterwards
through
the
whole
length
of
the
green
street
he
begs
the
officer
in
charge
with
a
plaintive
and
tearful
voice
not
to
have
him
struck
too
hard
not
to
double
the
punishment
by
any
undue
severity
your
nobility
cries
the
unhappy
wretch
have
pity
on
me
treat
me
fraternally
so
that
i
may
pray
god
throughout
my
life
for
you
do
not
destroy
me
show
mercy
jerebiatnikof
had
waited
for
this
he
now
suspended
the
execution
and
engaged
the
prisoner
in
conversation
speaking
to
him
in
a
sentimental
compassionate
tone
but
my
good
fellow
he
would
say
what
am
i
to
do
it
is
the
law
that
punishes
you
it
is
the
law
your
nobility
you
can
make
it
everything
have
pity
upon
me
do
you
really
think
that
i
have
no
pity
on
you
do
you
think
it
is
any
pleasure
to
me
to
see
you
whipped
i
am
a
man
am
i
not
answer
me
am
i
not
a
man
certainly
your
nobility
we
know
that
the
officers
are
our
fathers
and
we
their
children
be
to
me
a
venerable
father
the
prisoner
would
cry
seeing
some
possibility
of
escaping
punishment
then
my
friend
judge
for
yourself
you
have
a
brain
to
think
with
you
know
i
am
human
i
ought
to
take
compassion
on
you
sinner
though
you
be
your
nobility
says
the
absolute
truth
yes
i
ought
to
be
merciful
to
you
however
guilty
you
may
be
but
it
is
not
i
who
punish
you
it
is
the
law
i
serve
god
and
my
country
and
consequently
i
commit
a
grave
sin
if
i
mitigate
the
punishment
fixed
by
the
law
only
think
of
that
your
nobility
well
what
am
i
to
do
only
think
i
know
that
i
am
doing
wrong
but
it
shall
be
as
you
wish
i
will
have
mercy
upon
you
you
shall
be
punished
lightly
but
if
i
really
do
this
on
one
occasion
if
i
show
mercy
if
i
punish
you
lightly
you
will
think
that
at
another
time
i
shall
be
merciful
and
you
will
recommence
your
follies
what
do
you
say
to
that
your
nobility
preserve
me
before
the
throne
of
the
heavenly
creator
i
no
no
you
swear
that
you
will
behave
yourself
may
the
lord
cause
me
to
die
this
moment
and
in
the
next
world
do
not
swear
in
that
way
it
is
a
sin
i
shall
believe
you
if
you
will
give
me
your
word
your
nobility
well
listen
i
will
have
mercy
on
you
on
account
of
your
tears
your
orphan
tears
for
you
are
an
orphan
are
you
not
orphan
on
both
sides
your
nobility
i
am
alone
in
the
world
well
on
account
of
your
orphan
tears
i
have
pity
on
you
he
added
in
a
voice
so
full
of
emotion
that
the
prisoner
could
not
sufficiently
thank
god
for
having
sent
him
so
good
an
officer
the
procession
went
out
the
drum
rolled
the
soldiers
brandished
their
arms
flog
him
jerebiatnikof
would
roar
from
the
bottom
of
his
lungs
flog
him
burn
him
skin
him
alive
harder
harder
give
it
harder
to
this
orphan
give
it
him
the
rogue
the
soldiers
lay
on
the
strokes
with
all
their
might
on
the
back
of
the
unhappy
wretch
whose
eyes
dart
fire
and
who
howls
while
jerebiatnikof
runs
after
him
in
front
of
the
line
holding
his
sides
with
laughter
he
puffs
and
blows
so
that
he
can
scarcely
hold
himself
upright
he
is
happy
he
thinks
it
droll
from
time
to
time
his
formidable
resonant
laugh
is
heard
as
he
keeps
on
repeating
flog
him
thrash
him
this
brigand
this
orphan
he
had
composed
variation
on
this
motive
the
prisoner
has
been
brought
to
undergo
his
punishment
he
begs
the
lieutenant
to
have
pity
on
him
this
time
jerebiatnikof
does
not
play
the
hypocrite
he
is
frank
with
the
prisoner
look
my
dear
fellow
i
will
punish
you
as
you
deserve
but
i
can
show
you
one
act
of
mercy
i
will
not
attach
you
to
the
butt
end
of
the
musket
you
shall
go
along
in
a
new
style
you
have
only
to
run
as
hard
as
you
can
along
the
front
each
rod
will
strike
you
as
a
matter
of
course
but
it
will
be
over
sooner
what
do
you
say
to
that
will
you
try
the
prisoner
who
has
listened
full
of
mistrust
and
doubt
says
to
himself
perhaps
this
way
will
not
be
so
bad
as
the
other
if
i
run
with
all
my
might
it
will
not
last
quite
so
long
and
perhaps
all
the
rods
will
not
touch
me
well
your
nobility
i
consent
i
also
consent
come
mind
your
business
cries
the
lieutenant
to
the
soldiers
he
knew
beforehand
that
not
one
rod
would
spare
the
back
of
the
unfortunate
wretch
the
soldier
who
failed
to
hit
him
would
know
what
to
expect
the
convict
tries
to
run
along
the
green
street
but
he
does
not
go
beyond
fifteen
men
before
the
rods
rain
upon
his
poor
spine
like
hail
so
that
the
unfortunate
man
shrieks
out
and
falls
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
a
bullet
no
your
nobility
i
prefer
to
be
flogged
in
the
ordinary
way
he
says
managing
to
get
up
pale
and
frightened
while
jerebiatnikof
who
knew
beforehand
how
this
affair
would
end
held
his
sides
and
burst
into
a
laugh
but
i
can
not
relate
all
the
diversions
invented
by
him
and
all
that
was
told
about
him
my
companions
also
spoke
of
a
lieutenant
smekaloff
who
fulfilled
the
functions
of
commandant
before
the
arrival
of
our
present
major
they
spoke
of
jerebiatnikof
with
indifference
without
hatred
but
also
without
exalting
his
high
achievements
they
did
not
praise
him
they
simply
despised
him
whilst
at
the
name
of
smekaloff
the
whole
prison
burst
into
a
chorus
of
laudation
the
lieutenant
was
by
no
means
fond
of
administering
the
rods
there
was
nothing
in
him
of
disposition
how
did
it
happen
that
the
convicts
remembered
his
punishments
severe
as
they
were
with
sweet
satisfaction
how
did
he
manage
to
please
them
how
did
he
gain
the
popularity
he
certainly
enjoyed
our
companions
like
russian
people
in
general
were
ready
to
forget
their
tortures
if
a
kind
word
was
said
to
them
i
speak
of
the
effect
itself
without
analysing
or
examining
it
it
is
not
difficult
then
to
gain
the
affections
of
such
a
people
and
become
popular
lieutenant
smekaloff
had
gained
such
popularity
and
when
the
punishments
he
had
directed
were
spoken
of
they
were
always
mentioned
with
a
certain
sympathy
he
was
as
kind
as
a
father
the
convicts
would
sometimes
say
as
with
a
sigh
they
compared
him
with
their
present
chief
the
major
who
had
replaced
him
he
was
a
man
and
kind
in
a
manner
there
are
chiefs
who
are
naturally
kind
and
merciful
but
who
are
not
at
all
liked
and
are
laughed
at
whereas
smekaloff
had
so
managed
that
all
the
prisoners
had
a
special
regard
for
him
this
was
due
to
innate
qualities
which
those
who
possess
them
do
not
understand
strange
thing
there
are
men
who
are
far
from
being
kind
and
who
have
yet
the
talent
of
making
themselves
popular
they
do
not
despise
the
people
who
are
beneath
their
rule
that
i
think
is
the
cause
of
this
popularity
they
do
not
give
themselves
lordly
airs
they
have
no
feeling
of
caste
they
have
a
certain
odour
of
the
people
they
are
men
of
birth
and
the
people
at
once
sniff
it
they
will
do
anything
for
such
men
they
will
gladly
change
the
mildest
and
most
humane
man
for
a
very
severe
chief
if
the
latter
possesses
this
sort
of
odour
and
especially
if
the
man
is
also
genial
in
his
way
oh
then
he
is
beyond
price
lieutenant
smekaloff
as
i
have
said
ordered
sometimes
very
severe
punishments
but
he
seemed
to
inflict
them
in
such
a
way
that
the
prisoners
felt
no
rancour
against
him
on
the
contrary
they
recalled
his
whipping
affairs
with
laughter
he
did
not
punish
frequently
for
he
had
no
artistic
imagination
he
had
invented
only
one
practical
joke
a
single
one
which
amused
him
for
nearly
a
year
in
our
convict
prison
this
joke
was
dear
to
him
probably
because
it
was
his
only
one
and
it
was
not
without
humour
smekaloff
assisted
himself
at
the
executions
joking
all
the
time
and
laughing
at
the
prisoner
as
he
questioned
him
about
the
most
things
such
for
instance
as
his
private
affairs
he
did
this
without
any
bad
motive
and
simply
because
he
really
wished
to
know
something
about
the
man
affairs
a
chair
was
brought
to
him
together
with
the
rods
which
were
to
be
used
for
chastising
the
prisoner
the
lieutenant
sat
down
and
lighted
his
long
pipe
the
prisoner
implored
him
no
comrade
lie
down
what
is
the
matter
with
you
the
convict
stretched
himself
on
the
ground
with
a
sigh
can
you
read
fluently
of
course
your
nobility
i
am
baptized
and
i
was
taught
to
read
when
i
was
a
child
then
read
this
the
convict
knows
beforehand
what
he
is
to
read
and
knows
how
the
reading
will
end
because
this
joke
has
been
repeated
more
than
thirty
times
but
smekaloff
knows
also
that
the
convict
is
not
his
dupe
any
more
than
the
soldier
who
now
holds
the
rods
suspended
over
the
back
of
the
unhappy
victim
the
convict
begins
to
read
the
soldiers
armed
with
the
rods
await
motionless
smekaloff
ceases
even
to
smoke
raises
his
hand
and
waits
for
a
word
fixed
upon
beforehand
at
the
word
which
from
some
double
meaning
might
be
interpreted
as
the
order
to
start
the
lieutenant
raises
his
hand
and
the
flogging
begins
the
officer
bursts
into
a
laugh
and
the
soldiers
around
him
also
laugh
the
man
who
is
whipping
laughs
and
the
man
who
is
being
whipped
also
chapter
iii
the
hospital
i
have
spoken
here
of
punishments
and
of
those
who
have
administered
them
because
i
got
a
very
clear
idea
on
the
subject
during
my
stay
in
the
hospital
until
then
i
knew
of
them
only
by
general
report
in
our
room
were
confined
all
the
prisoners
from
the
battalion
who
were
to
receive
the
spitzruten
rods
as
well
as
those
from
the
military
establishment
in
our
town
and
in
the
district
surrounding
it
during
my
first
few
days
i
looked
at
all
that
surrounded
me
with
such
greedy
eyes
that
these
strange
manners
these
men
who
had
just
been
flogged
or
were
about
to
be
flogged
left
upon
me
a
terrible
impression
i
was
agitated
frightened
as
i
listened
to
the
conversation
or
narratives
of
the
other
prisoners
on
this
subject
i
put
to
myself
questions
which
i
endeavoured
in
vain
to
solve
i
wished
to
know
all
the
degrees
of
the
sentences
the
punishments
and
their
shades
and
to
learn
the
opinion
of
the
convicts
themselves
i
tried
to
represent
to
myself
the
psychological
condition
of
the
men
flogged
it
rarely
happened
as
i
have
already
said
that
the
prisoner
approached
the
fatal
moment
in
cold
blood
even
if
he
had
been
beaten
several
times
before
the
condemned
man
experiences
a
fear
which
is
very
terrible
but
purely
physical
an
unconscious
fear
which
upsets
his
moral
nature
during
my
several
years
stay
in
the
convict
prison
i
was
able
to
study
at
leisure
the
prisoners
who
wished
to
leave
the
hospital
where
they
had
remained
some
time
to
have
their
damaged
backs
cured
before
receiving
the
second
half
of
their
punishment
this
interruption
in
the
punishment
is
always
called
for
by
the
doctor
who
assists
at
the
execution
if
the
number
of
strokes
to
be
received
is
too
great
for
them
to
be
administered
all
at
once
it
is
divided
according
to
advice
given
by
the
doctor
on
the
spot
it
is
for
him
to
see
if
the
prisoner
is
in
a
condition
to
undergo
the
whole
of
his
punishment
or
if
his
life
is
in
danger
five
hundred
one
thousand
and
even
one
thousand
five
hundred
strokes
with
the
stick
are
administered
at
once
but
if
it
is
two
or
three
thousand
the
punishment
is
divided
into
two
or
three
doses
those
whose
back
had
been
cured
after
the
first
administration
and
who
are
to
undergo
a
second
were
sad
sombre
and
silent
the
day
they
went
out
and
the
evening
before
they
were
almost
in
a
state
of
torpor
they
engaged
in
no
conversation
and
remained
perfectly
silent
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
prisoners
avoid
addressing
those
who
are
about
to
be
punished
and
above
all
never
make
any
allusion
to
the
subject
neither
in
consolation
nor
in
superfluous
words
no
attention
whatever
is
paid
to
them
which
is
certainly
the
best
thing
for
the
prisoner
there
are
exceptions
however
the
convict
orloff
of
whom
i
have
already
spoken
was
sorry
that
his
back
did
not
get
more
quickly
cured
for
he
was
anxious
to
get
his
in
order
that
he
might
take
the
rest
of
his
flogging
and
then
be
assigned
to
a
convoy
of
prisoners
when
he
meant
to
escape
during
the
journey
he
had
a
passionate
ardent
nature
and
with
only
that
object
in
view
a
cunning
rascal
he
seemed
very
pleased
when
he
first
came
but
he
was
in
a
state
of
abnormal
excitement
though
he
endeavoured
to
conceal
it
he
had
been
afraid
of
being
left
on
the
ground
and
dying
before
half
of
his
punishment
had
been
undergone
he
had
heard
steps
taken
in
his
case
by
the
authorities
when
he
was
still
being
tried
and
he
thought
he
could
not
survive
the
punishment
but
when
he
had
received
his
first
dose
he
recovered
his
courage
when
he
came
to
the
hospital
i
had
never
seen
such
wounds
as
his
but
he
was
in
the
best
spirits
he
now
hoped
to
be
able
to
live
the
stories
which
had
reached
him
were
untrue
or
the
execution
would
not
have
been
interrupted
he
now
began
to
think
of
a
long
siberian
journey
possibly
of
escaping
to
liberty
fields
and
forests
two
days
after
he
had
left
the
hospital
he
came
back
to
die
on
the
very
couch
which
he
had
occupied
during
my
stay
there
he
had
been
unable
to
support
the
second
half
of
his
punishment
but
i
have
already
spoken
of
this
man
all
the
prisoners
without
exception
even
the
most
pusillanimous
even
those
who
were
beforehand
tormented
night
and
day
supported
it
courageously
when
it
came
i
scarcely
ever
heard
groans
during
the
night
following
the
execution
our
people
as
a
rule
knew
how
to
endure
pain
i
questioned
my
companion
often
in
reference
to
this
pain
that
i
might
know
to
what
kind
of
suffering
it
might
be
compared
it
was
no
idle
curiosity
which
urged
me
i
repeat
that
i
was
moved
and
frightened
but
it
was
in
vain
i
could
get
no
satisfactory
reply
it
burns
like
fire
was
the
general
answer
they
all
said
the
same
thing
first
i
tried
to
question
m
tski
it
burns
like
fire
like
hell
it
seems
as
if
one
back
were
in
a
furnace
i
made
one
day
a
strange
observation
which
may
or
may
not
have
been
well
founded
although
the
opinion
of
the
convicts
themselves
confirms
my
views
namely
that
the
rods
are
the
most
terrible
punishment
in
use
among
us
at
first
it
seems
absurd
impossible
yet
five
hundred
strokes
of
the
rods
four
hundred
even
are
enough
to
kill
a
man
beyond
five
hundred
death
is
almost
certain
the
most
robust
man
will
be
unable
to
support
a
thousand
rods
whereas
five
hundred
sticks
are
endured
without
much
inconvenience
and
without
the
least
risk
in
the
world
of
losing
life
a
man
of
ordinary
build
supports
a
thousand
sticks
without
danger
even
two
thousand
sticks
will
not
kill
a
man
of
ordinary
strength
and
constitution
all
the
convicts
declared
that
rods
were
worse
than
sticks
or
ramrods
rods
hurt
more
and
torture
more
they
said
they
must
torture
more
than
sticks
that
is
certain
that
is
evident
for
they
irritate
much
more
forcibly
the
nervous
system
which
they
excite
beyond
measure
i
do
not
know
whether
any
person
still
exists
but
such
did
a
short
time
ago
to
whom
the
whipping
of
a
victim
procured
a
delight
which
recalls
the
marquis
de
sade
and
the
marchioness
brinvilliers
i
think
this
delight
must
consist
in
the
sinking
of
the
heart
and
that
these
nobles
must
have
experienced
pain
and
delight
at
the
same
time
there
are
people
who
like
tigers
are
greedy
for
blood
those
who
have
possessed
unlimited
power
over
the
flesh
blood
and
soul
of
their
of
their
brethren
according
to
the
law
of
christ
those
who
have
possessed
this
power
and
who
have
been
able
to
degrade
with
a
supreme
degradation
another
being
made
in
the
image
of
god
these
men
are
incapable
of
resisting
their
desires
and
their
thirst
for
sensations
tyranny
is
a
habit
capable
of
being
developed
and
at
last
becomes
a
disease
i
declare
that
the
best
man
in
the
world
can
become
hardened
and
brutified
to
such
a
point
that
nothing
will
distinguish
him
from
a
wild
beast
blood
and
power
intoxicate
they
aid
the
development
of
callousness
and
debauchery
the
mind
then
becomes
capable
of
the
most
abnormal
cruelty
in
the
form
of
pleasure
the
man
and
the
citizen
disappear
for
ever
in
the
tyrant
and
then
a
return
to
human
dignity
repentance
moral
resurrection
becomes
almost
impossible
that
the
possibility
of
such
license
has
a
contagious
effect
on
the
whole
of
society
there
is
no
doubt
a
society
which
looks
upon
such
things
with
an
indifferent
eye
is
already
infected
to
the
marrow
in
a
word
the
right
granted
to
a
man
to
inflict
corporal
punishment
on
his
is
one
of
the
of
our
society
it
is
the
means
of
annihilating
all
civic
spirit
such
a
right
contains
in
germ
the
elements
of
inevitable
imminent
decomposition
society
despises
an
executioner
by
trade
but
not
a
lordly
executioner
every
manufacturer
every
master
of
works
must
feel
an
irritating
pleasure
when
he
reflects
that
the
workman
he
has
beneath
his
orders
is
dependent
upon
him
with
the
whole
of
his
family
a
generation
does
not
i
am
sure
extirpate
so
quickly
what
is
hereditary
in
it
a
man
can
not
renounce
what
is
in
his
blood
what
has
been
transmitted
to
him
with
his
mother
milk
these
revolutions
are
not
accomplished
so
quickly
it
is
not
enough
to
confess
one
fault
that
is
very
little
very
little
indeed
it
must
be
rooted
out
and
that
is
not
done
so
quickly
i
have
spoken
of
the
executioners
the
instincts
of
an
executioner
are
in
germ
in
nearly
every
one
of
our
contemporaries
but
the
animal
instincts
of
the
man
have
not
developed
themselves
in
a
uniform
manner
when
they
stifle
all
other
faculties
the
man
becomes
a
hideous
monster
there
are
two
kinds
of
executioners
those
who
of
their
own
will
are
executioners
and
those
who
are
executioners
by
duty
by
reason
of
office
he
who
by
his
own
will
is
an
executioner
is
in
all
respects
below
the
salaried
executioner
whom
however
the
people
look
upon
with
repugnance
and
who
inspires
them
with
disgust
with
instinctive
mystical
fear
whence
comes
this
almost
superstitious
horror
for
the
latter
when
one
is
only
indifferent
and
indulgent
to
the
former
i
know
strange
examples
of
honourable
men
kind
esteemed
by
all
their
friends
who
found
it
necessary
that
a
culprit
should
be
whipped
until
he
would
implore
and
beg
for
mercy
it
seemed
to
them
a
natural
thing
a
thing
recognised
as
indispensable
if
the
victim
did
not
choose
to
cry
out
his
executioner
whom
in
other
respects
i
should
consider
a
good
man
looked
upon
it
as
a
personal
offence
he
meant
in
the
first
instance
to
inflict
only
a
light
punishment
but
directly
he
failed
to
hear
the
habitual
supplications
your
nobility
have
mercy
be
a
father
to
me
let
me
thank
god
all
my
life
he
became
furious
and
ordered
that
fifty
more
blows
should
be
administered
hoping
thus
at
last
to
obtain
the
necessary
cries
and
supplications
and
at
last
they
came
impossible
he
is
too
insolent
cried
the
man
in
question
very
seriously
as
for
the
executioner
by
office
he
is
a
convict
who
has
been
chosen
for
this
function
he
passes
an
apprenticeship
with
an
old
hand
and
as
soon
as
he
knows
his
trade
remains
in
the
convict
prison
where
he
lives
by
himself
he
has
a
room
which
he
shares
with
no
one
sometimes
indeed
he
has
a
separate
establishment
but
he
is
always
under
guard
a
man
is
not
a
machine
although
he
whips
by
virtue
of
his
office
he
sometimes
becomes
furious
and
beats
with
a
certain
pleasure
notwithstanding
he
has
no
hatred
for
his
victim
a
desire
to
show
his
skill
in
the
art
of
whipping
may
sharpen
his
vanity
he
works
as
an
artist
he
knows
well
that
he
is
a
reprobate
and
that
he
excites
everywhere
superstitious
dread
it
is
impossible
that
this
should
exercise
no
influence
upon
him
and
not
irritate
his
brutal
instincts
even
little
children
say
that
this
man
has
neither
father
nor
mother
strange
thing
all
the
executioners
i
have
known
were
intelligent
men
possessing
a
certain
degree
of
conceit
this
conceit
became
developed
in
them
through
the
contempt
which
they
everywhere
met
with
and
was
strengthened
perhaps
by
the
consciousness
of
the
fear
with
which
they
inspired
their
victims
and
of
the
power
over
unfortunate
wretches
the
theatrical
paraphernalia
surrounding
them
developed
perhaps
in
them
a
certain
arrogance
i
had
for
some
time
an
opportunity
of
meeting
and
observing
at
close
quarters
an
ordinary
executioner
he
was
a
man
about
forty
muscular
dry
with
an
agreeable
intelligent
face
surrounded
by
long
curly
hair
his
manners
were
quiet
and
grave
his
general
demeanour
becoming
he
replied
clearly
and
sensibly
to
all
questions
put
to
him
but
with
a
sort
of
condescension
as
if
he
were
in
some
way
my
superior
the
officers
of
the
guard
spoke
to
him
with
a
certain
respect
which
he
fully
appreciated
for
which
reason
in
presence
of
his
chiefs
he
became
polite
and
more
dignified
than
ever
he
never
departed
from
the
most
refined
politeness
i
am
sure
that
when
i
was
speaking
to
him
he
felt
incomparably
superior
to
the
man
who
was
addressing
him
i
could
read
that
in
his
countenance
sometimes
he
was
sent
under
escort
in
summer
when
it
was
very
hot
to
kill
the
dogs
of
the
town
with
a
long
very
thin
spear
these
wandering
dogs
increased
in
numbers
with
such
prodigious
rapidity
and
became
so
dangerous
during
the
dog
days
that
by
the
decision
of
the
authorities
the
executioner
was
ordered
to
destroy
them
this
degrading
duty
did
not
in
any
way
humiliate
him
it
should
have
been
seen
with
what
gravity
he
walked
through
the
streets
of
the
town
accompanied
by
a
soldier
escorting
him
how
with
a
single
glance
he
frightened
the
women
and
children
and
how
from
the
height
of
his
grandeur
he
looked
down
upon
the
generally
executioners
live
at
their
ease
they
have
money
to
travel
comfortably
and
drink
vodka
they
derive
most
of
their
income
from
presents
which
the
prisoners
condemned
to
be
flogged
slip
into
their
hands
before
the
execution
when
they
have
to
do
with
convicts
who
are
rich
they
then
fix
a
sum
to
be
paid
in
proportion
to
the
means
of
the
victim
they
will
exact
thirty
roubles
sometimes
more
the
executioner
has
no
right
to
spare
his
victim
and
he
does
so
at
the
risk
of
his
own
back
but
for
a
suitable
present
he
agrees
not
to
strike
too
hard
people
almost
always
give
what
he
asks
should
they
in
any
case
refuse
he
would
strike
like
a
savage
and
it
is
in
his
power
to
do
so
he
sometimes
exacts
a
heavy
sum
from
a
man
who
is
very
poor
then
all
the
relations
of
the
victim
are
put
in
movement
they
bargain
try
and
beat
him
down
supplicate
him
but
it
will
not
be
well
if
they
do
not
succeed
in
satisfying
him
in
such
a
case
the
superstitious
fear
inspired
by
the
executioner
stands
them
in
good
part
i
had
been
told
the
most
wonderful
things
that
at
one
blow
the
executioner
can
kill
his
man
is
this
your
experience
i
asked
perhaps
so
who
knows
their
tone
seemed
to
decide
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
about
it
they
also
told
me
that
he
can
strike
a
criminal
in
such
a
way
that
he
will
not
feel
the
least
pain
and
without
leaving
a
scar
even
when
the
executioner
receives
a
present
not
to
whip
too
severely
he
gives
the
first
blow
with
all
his
strength
it
is
the
custom
then
he
administers
the
other
blows
with
less
severity
above
all
if
he
has
been
well
paid
i
do
not
know
why
this
is
done
is
it
to
prepare
the
victim
for
the
succeeding
blows
which
will
appear
less
painful
after
the
first
cruel
one
or
do
they
want
to
frighten
the
criminal
so
that
he
may
know
with
whom
he
has
to
deal
or
do
they
simply
wish
to
display
their
vigour
from
vanity
in
any
case
the
executioner
is
slightly
excited
before
the
execution
and
he
is
conscious
of
his
strength
and
of
his
power
he
is
acting
at
the
time
the
public
admires
him
and
is
filled
with
terror
accordingly
it
is
not
without
satisfaction
that
he
cries
out
to
his
victim
look
out
you
are
going
to
have
it
customary
and
fatal
words
which
precede
the
first
blow
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
a
human
being
degraded
to
such
a
point
the
first
day
of
my
stay
at
the
hospital
i
listened
attentively
to
the
stories
of
the
convicts
which
broke
the
monotony
of
the
long
days
in
the
morning
the
doctor
visit
was
the
first
diversion
then
came
dinner
which
it
will
be
believed
was
the
most
important
affair
of
our
daily
life
the
portions
were
different
according
to
the
nature
of
the
illness
some
of
the
prisoners
received
nothing
but
broth
with
groats
in
it
others
nothing
but
gruel
others
a
kind
of
semolina
which
was
much
liked
the
convicts
ended
by
becoming
effeminate
and
fastidious
the
convalescents
received
a
piece
of
boiled
beef
the
best
food
which
was
reserved
for
the
scorbutic
patients
consisted
of
roast
beef
with
onions
horseradish
and
sometimes
a
small
glass
of
spirits
the
bread
was
according
to
the
illness
black
or
brown
the
precision
preserved
in
distributing
the
rations
would
make
the
patients
laugh
there
were
some
who
took
absolutely
nothing
the
portions
were
exchanged
in
such
a
way
that
the
food
intended
for
one
patient
was
eaten
by
another
those
who
were
being
kept
on
low
diet
who
received
only
small
rations
bought
those
of
the
scorbutic
patients
others
would
give
any
price
for
meat
there
were
some
who
ate
two
entire
portions
it
cost
them
a
good
deal
for
they
were
generally
sold
at
five
kopecks
each
if
one
had
no
meat
to
sell
in
our
room
the
warder
was
sent
to
another
section
and
if
he
could
not
find
any
there
he
was
asked
to
get
some
from
the
military
infirmary
the
free
infirmary
as
we
called
it
there
were
always
patients
ready
to
sell
their
rations
poverty
was
general
and
those
who
possessed
a
few
kopecks
used
to
send
out
to
buy
cakes
and
white
bread
or
other
delicacies
at
the
market
warders
executed
these
commissions
in
a
disinterested
manner
the
most
painful
moment
was
that
which
followed
the
dinner
some
went
to
sleep
if
they
had
no
other
way
of
passing
their
time
others
either
wrangled
or
told
stories
in
a
loud
voice
when
no
new
patients
were
brought
in
everything
became
very
dull
the
arrival
of
a
new
patient
caused
always
a
certain
excitement
above
all
if
no
one
knew
anything
about
him
he
was
questioned
about
his
past
life
the
most
interesting
ones
were
the
birds
of
passage
they
had
always
something
to
tell
of
course
they
never
spoke
of
their
own
little
faults
if
the
prisoner
did
not
enter
upon
this
subject
himself
no
one
questioned
him
about
it
the
only
thing
he
was
asked
was
what
quarter
he
came
from
who
were
with
him
on
the
road
what
state
the
road
was
in
where
he
was
being
taken
to
etc
stimulated
by
the
stories
of
the
new
comers
our
comrades
in
their
turn
began
to
tell
what
they
had
seen
and
done
what
was
most
talked
about
was
the
convoys
those
in
command
of
them
the
men
who
carried
the
sentences
into
execution
about
this
time
too
towards
evening
the
convicts
who
had
been
scourged
came
up
they
always
made
a
rather
strong
impression
as
i
have
said
but
it
was
not
every
day
that
any
of
these
were
brought
to
us
and
everybody
was
bored
to
extinction
when
nothing
happened
to
give
a
fillip
to
the
general
relaxed
and
indolent
state
of
feeling
it
seemed
then
as
though
the
sick
themselves
were
exasperated
at
the
very
sight
of
those
near
them
sometimes
they
squabbled
violently
our
convicts
were
in
high
glee
when
a
madman
was
taken
off
for
medical
examination
sometimes
those
who
were
sentenced
to
be
scourged
feigned
insanity
that
they
might
get
off
the
trick
was
found
out
or
it
would
sometimes
be
that
they
voluntarily
gave
up
the
pretence
prisoners
who
during
two
or
three
days
had
done
all
sorts
of
wild
things
suddenly
became
steady
and
sensible
people
quieted
down
and
with
a
gloomy
smile
asked
to
be
taken
out
of
the
hospital
neither
the
other
convicts
nor
the
doctors
said
a
word
of
remonstrance
to
them
about
the
deceit
or
brought
up
the
subject
of
their
mad
pranks
their
names
were
put
down
on
a
list
without
a
word
being
said
and
they
were
simply
taken
elsewhere
after
the
lapse
of
some
days
they
came
back
to
us
with
their
backs
all
wounds
and
blood
on
the
other
hand
the
arrival
of
a
genuine
lunatic
was
a
miserable
thing
to
see
all
through
the
place
those
of
the
mentally
unsound
who
were
gay
lively
who
uttered
cries
danced
sang
were
greeted
at
first
with
enthusiasm
by
the
convicts
here
fun
said
they
as
they
looked
on
the
grins
and
contortions
of
the
unfortunates
but
the
sight
was
horribly
painful
and
sad
i
have
never
been
able
to
look
upon
the
mad
calmly
or
with
indifference
there
was
one
who
was
kept
three
weeks
in
our
room
we
would
have
hidden
ourselves
had
there
been
any
place
to
do
it
when
things
were
at
the
worst
they
brought
in
another
this
one
affected
me
very
powerfully
in
the
first
year
or
to
be
more
exact
during
the
first
month
of
my
exile
i
went
to
work
with
a
gang
of
kiln
men
to
the
tileries
situate
at
two
versts
from
our
prison
we
were
set
to
repairing
the
kiln
in
which
the
bricks
were
baked
in
summer
that
morning
in
which
m
tski
and
made
me
acquainted
with
the
officer
superintendent
of
the
works
this
was
a
pole
already
well
on
in
life
sixty
years
old
at
least
of
high
stature
lean
of
decent
and
even
somewhat
imposing
exterior
he
had
been
a
long
time
in
service
in
siberia
and
although
he
belonged
to
the
lower
orders
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
in
the
rising
of
m
tski
and
loved
and
esteemed
him
he
was
always
reading
the
vulgate
i
spoke
to
him
his
talk
was
agreeable
and
intelligent
he
told
a
story
in
a
most
interesting
way
he
was
straightforward
and
of
excellent
temper
for
two
years
i
never
saw
him
again
all
i
heard
was
that
he
had
become
a
case
and
that
they
were
inquiring
into
it
and
then
one
fine
day
they
brought
him
into
our
room
he
had
gone
quite
mad
he
came
in
yelling
uttering
shouts
of
laughter
and
began
to
dance
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
indecent
gestures
which
recalled
the
dance
known
as
kamarinskaïa
the
convicts
were
wild
with
enthusiasm
but
for
my
part
account
for
it
as
you
will
i
felt
utterly
miserable
three
days
after
we
were
all
of
us
upset
with
it
he
got
into
violent
disputes
with
everybody
fought
groaned
sang
in
the
dead
of
the
night
his
aberrations
were
so
inordinate
and
disgusting
as
to
bring
our
very
stomachs
up
he
feared
nobody
they
put
the
on
him
but
we
were
no
whit
better
off
for
it
for
he
went
on
quarreling
and
fighting
all
round
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
the
room
put
up
an
unanimous
entreaty
to
the
head
doctor
that
he
might
be
removed
to
the
other
apartment
reserved
for
the
convicts
but
after
two
days
at
the
request
of
the
sick
people
in
that
other
room
they
brought
him
back
to
our
infirmary
as
we
had
two
madmen
there
at
once
both
rooms
kept
sending
them
back
and
forward
and
ended
by
taking
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
lunatics
turn
and
turn
about
everybody
breathed
more
freely
when
they
took
them
away
from
us
a
good
way
off
somewhere
or
other
there
was
another
lunatic
whom
i
remember
a
very
remarkable
creature
they
had
brought
in
during
the
summer
a
man
under
sentence
who
looked
like
a
solid
and
vigorous
fellow
enough
of
about
years
his
face
was
sombre
and
sad
pitted
with
with
little
red
and
swollen
eyes
he
sat
down
by
my
side
he
was
extremely
quiet
spoke
to
nobody
and
seemed
utterly
absorbed
in
his
own
deep
reflections
night
fell
then
he
addressed
me
and
without
a
word
of
preface
told
me
in
a
hurried
and
excited
way
as
if
it
were
a
mighty
secret
he
were
confiding
that
he
was
to
have
two
thousand
strokes
with
the
rod
but
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
as
the
daughter
of
colonel
g
was
taking
steps
on
his
behalf
i
looked
at
him
with
surprise
and
observed
that
as
i
saw
the
affair
the
daughter
of
a
colonel
could
be
of
little
use
in
such
a
case
i
had
not
yet
guessed
what
sort
of
person
i
had
to
do
with
for
they
had
brought
him
to
the
hospital
as
a
bodily
sick
person
not
mentally
i
then
asked
him
what
illness
he
was
suffering
from
he
answered
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
that
he
had
been
sent
among
us
for
something
or
other
but
that
he
was
in
good
health
and
that
the
colonel
daughter
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
two
weeks
before
she
had
passed
in
a
carriage
before
the
where
he
was
looking
through
the
barred
window
and
she
had
gone
head
over
ears
in
love
at
the
mere
sight
of
him
after
that
important
moment
she
had
come
three
times
to
the
on
different
pretexts
the
first
time
with
her
father
ostensibly
to
visit
her
brother
who
was
the
officer
on
service
the
second
with
her
mother
to
distribute
alms
to
the
prisoners
as
she
passed
in
front
of
him
she
had
muttered
that
she
loved
him
and
would
get
him
out
of
prison
he
told
me
all
this
nonsense
with
minute
and
exact
details
all
of
it
pure
figment
of
his
poor
disordered
head
he
believed
devoutly
and
implicitly
that
his
punishment
would
be
graciously
remitted
he
spoke
very
calmly
and
with
all
assurance
of
the
passionate
love
he
had
inspired
in
this
young
lady
this
odd
and
romantic
delusion
about
the
love
of
quite
a
young
girl
of
good
breeding
for
a
man
nearly
fifty
years
and
afflicted
with
a
face
so
disfigured
and
gloomy
simply
showed
the
fearful
effect
produced
by
the
fear
of
the
punishment
he
was
to
have
upon
the
poor
timid
creature
it
may
be
that
he
had
really
seen
some
one
through
the
bars
of
the
window
and
the
insanity
germinating
under
excess
of
fear
had
found
shape
and
form
in
the
delusion
in
question
this
unfortunate
soldier
who
it
may
be
warranted
had
never
given
a
thought
to
young
ladies
had
got
this
romance
into
his
diseased
fancy
and
clung
convulsively
to
this
wild
hope
i
heard
him
in
silence
and
then
told
the
story
to
the
other
convicts
when
these
questioned
him
in
their
natural
curiosity
he
preserved
a
chastely
discreet
silence
next
day
the
doctor
examined
him
as
the
madman
averred
that
he
was
not
ill
he
was
put
down
on
the
list
as
qualified
to
be
sent
out
we
learned
that
the
physician
had
scribbled
on
the
page
when
it
was
quite
too
late
to
give
him
warning
besides
we
were
ourselves
not
by
any
means
sure
what
was
really
the
matter
with
the
man
the
error
was
with
the
authorities
who
had
sent
him
to
us
without
specifying
for
what
reason
it
was
thought
necessary
to
have
him
come
into
the
hospital
which
was
unpardonable
negligence
however
two
days
later
the
unhappy
creature
was
taken
out
to
be
scourged
we
understood
that
he
was
dumbfounded
by
finding
contrary
to
his
fixed
expectation
that
he
really
was
to
have
the
punishment
to
the
last
moment
he
thought
he
would
be
pardoned
and
when
conducted
to
the
front
of
the
battalion
he
began
to
cry
for
help
as
there
was
no
room
or
now
in
our
apartment
they
sent
him
to
the
infirmary
i
heard
that
for
eight
entire
days
he
did
not
utter
a
single
word
and
remained
in
stupid
and
mental
confusion
when
his
back
was
cured
they
took
him
off
i
never
heard
a
single
further
word
about
him
as
to
the
treatment
of
the
sick
and
the
remedies
prescribed
those
who
were
but
slightly
indisposed
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
the
directions
of
the
doctors
and
never
took
their
medicines
while
speaking
generally
those
really
ill
were
very
careful
in
following
the
doctor
orders
they
took
their
mixtures
and
powders
they
took
all
the
possible
care
they
could
of
themselves
but
they
preferred
external
to
internal
remedies
leeches
cataplasms
in
all
which
things
the
populace
has
so
blind
a
confidence
were
held
in
high
honour
in
our
hospital
inflictions
of
that
sort
were
regarded
with
satisfaction
there
was
one
thing
quite
strange
and
to
me
interesting
fellows
who
stood
without
a
murmur
the
frightful
tortures
caused
by
the
rods
and
scourges
howled
and
grinned
and
moaned
for
the
least
little
ailment
whether
it
was
all
pretence
or
not
i
really
can
not
say
we
had
cuppings
of
a
quite
peculiar
kind
the
machine
with
which
instantaneous
incisions
in
the
skin
are
produced
was
all
out
of
order
so
they
had
to
use
the
lancet
for
a
cupping
twelve
incisions
are
necessary
with
a
machine
these
are
not
painful
at
all
for
it
makes
them
instantaneously
with
the
lancet
it
is
a
different
affair
altogether
that
cuts
slowly
and
makes
the
patient
suffer
if
you
have
to
make
ten
openings
there
will
be
about
one
hundred
and
twenty
pricks
and
these
very
painful
i
had
to
undergo
it
myself
besides
the
pain
itself
it
caused
great
nervous
irritation
but
the
suffering
was
not
so
great
that
one
could
not
contain
himself
from
groaning
if
he
tried
it
was
laughable
to
see
great
hulking
fellows
wriggling
and
howling
one
could
help
comparing
them
to
some
men
firm
and
calm
enough
in
really
serious
circumstances
but
all
or
caprice
in
the
bosom
of
their
families
for
nothing
at
all
if
dinner
is
late
or
the
like
then
they
scold
and
swear
everything
puts
them
out
they
go
wrong
with
everybody
the
more
comfortable
they
really
are
the
more
troublesome
are
they
to
other
people
characters
of
this
sort
common
enough
among
the
lower
orders
were
but
too
numerous
in
our
prison
by
reason
of
our
company
being
forced
on
one
another
sometimes
the
prisoners
chaffed
or
insulted
the
i
speak
of
and
then
they
would
leave
off
complaining
directly
as
if
they
only
wanted
to
be
insulted
to
make
them
hold
their
tongues
oustiantsef
was
no
friend
of
grimacings
of
this
kind
and
never
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
bringing
that
sort
of
delinquent
to
his
bearings
besides
he
was
fond
of
scolding
it
was
a
sort
of
necessity
with
him
engendered
by
illness
and
also
his
stupidity
he
would
first
fix
his
gaze
upon
you
for
some
time
and
then
treat
you
to
a
long
speech
of
threatening
and
warning
and
a
tone
of
calm
and
impartial
conviction
it
looked
as
though
he
thought
his
function
in
this
world
was
to
watch
over
order
and
morality
in
general
he
must
poke
his
nose
into
everything
the
prisoners
with
a
laugh
used
to
say
for
they
pitied
and
did
what
they
could
to
avoid
conflicts
with
him
has
he
chattered
enough
three
waggons
would
be
too
much
to
carry
away
all
his
talk
why
need
you
put
your
oar
in
one
is
not
going
to
put
himself
about
for
a
mere
idiot
what
there
to
cry
out
about
at
a
mere
touch
of
a
lancet
what
harm
in
the
world
do
you
fancy
is
going
to
do
you
no
comrades
a
prisoner
strikes
in
the
cuppings
are
a
mere
nothing
i
know
the
taste
of
them
but
the
most
horrid
thing
is
when
they
pull
your
ears
for
a
long
time
together
that
just
shuts
you
up
all
the
prisoners
burst
out
laughing
have
you
had
them
pulled
by
jove
yes
i
should
think
he
had
that
why
they
stick
upright
like
this
convict
chapkin
by
name
really
had
long
and
quite
erect
ears
he
had
long
led
a
vagabond
life
was
still
quite
young
intelligent
and
quiet
and
used
to
talk
with
a
dry
sort
of
humour
with
much
seriousness
on
the
surface
which
made
his
stories
very
comical
how
in
the
world
was
i
to
know
you
had
had
your
ears
pulled
and
lengthened
brainless
idiot
began
oustiantsef
once
more
wrathfully
addressing
chapkin
who
however
vouchsafed
no
attention
to
his
companion
obliging
apostrophe
well
who
did
pull
your
ears
for
you
some
one
asked
why
the
police
superintendent
by
jove
comrades
our
offence
was
wandering
about
without
fixed
place
of
abode
we
had
just
got
into
k
i
and
another
tramp
eptinie
he
had
no
family
name
that
fellow
on
the
way
we
had
fixed
ourselves
up
a
little
in
the
hamlet
of
tolmina
yes
there
is
a
hamlet
that
got
just
that
name
tolmina
well
we
get
to
the
town
and
are
just
looking
about
us
a
little
to
see
if
there
a
good
stroke
of
to
do
after
which
we
mean
to
flit
you
know
out
in
the
open
country
you
as
free
as
air
but
it
not
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
town
first
thing
we
go
into
a
as
we
open
the
door
we
give
a
sharp
look
all
round
there
a
sunburnt
fellow
in
a
german
coat
all
out
at
elbows
walks
right
up
to
us
one
thing
and
another
comes
up
when
he
says
to
us
excuse
me
for
asking
if
you
have
any
papers
passport
with
you
we
have
have
we
either
i
have
two
comrades
besides
these
with
me
who
are
in
the
service
of
general
cuckoo
forest
tramps
who
hear
the
birds
sing
we
have
been
seeing
life
a
bit
and
just
now
have
a
penny
to
bless
ourselves
with
may
i
take
the
liberty
of
requesting
you
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
order
a
quart
of
brandy
the
greatest
pleasure
that
what
we
say
to
him
so
we
drink
together
then
they
tell
us
of
a
place
where
there
a
real
good
stroke
of
business
to
be
done
a
house
at
the
end
of
the
town
belonging
to
a
wealthy
merchant
fellow
lots
of
good
things
there
so
we
make
up
our
minds
to
try
the
job
during
the
night
five
of
us
and
the
very
moment
we
are
going
at
it
they
pounce
on
us
take
us
to
the
and
then
before
the
head
of
the
police
he
says
shall
examine
them
myself
out
he
goes
with
his
pipe
and
they
bring
in
for
him
a
cup
of
tea
a
sturdy
fellow
it
was
with
whiskers
besides
us
five
there
were
three
other
tramps
just
brought
in
you
know
comrades
that
nothing
in
this
world
more
funny
than
a
tramp
because
he
always
forgets
everything
he
done
you
may
thump
his
head
till
you
tired
with
a
cudgel
all
the
same
you
get
but
one
answer
that
he
has
forgotten
all
about
everything
the
police
superintendent
then
turns
to
me
and
asks
me
squarely
may
you
be
i
answer
just
like
all
the
rest
of
them
forgotten
all
about
it
your
worship
you
wait
i
a
word
or
two
more
to
say
to
you
i
know
your
phiz
then
he
gives
me
a
good
long
stare
but
i
had
seen
him
anywhere
before
that
a
fact
then
he
asks
another
of
them
are
you
your
worship
call
you
that
your
worship
and
good
you
and
you
to
a
third
your
worship
what
your
name
your
name
i
called
your
worship
gave
you
that
name
hound
worthy
people
your
worship
there
are
lots
of
worthy
people
about
nobody
knows
that
better
than
your
worship
who
may
these
worthy
people
be
lord
it
has
slipped
my
memory
your
worship

be
so
kind
and
gracious
as
to
overlook
it

of
them
these
worthy
people
mother

of
them

worship

must
have
had
relations

father

mother

you
remember
them
suppose
i
must
have
had
your
worship
but
i
forgotten
about
my
memory
is
so
bad
now
i
come
to
think
about
it
i
sure
i
had
some
your
worship
where
have
you
been
living
till
now
the
woods
your
worship
in
the
woods
in
the
woods
too
saw
any
winter
your
worship
along
with
you
and
you
what
your
name
your
worship
yours
your
worship
you
your
worship
not
a
soul
of
you
remembers
anything
that
ever
happened
to
you
a
mother
son
of
us
anything
whatever
he
could
help
it
he
laughed
out
loud
all
the
rest
began
to
laugh
at
seeing
him
laugh
but
the
thing
does
not
always
go
off
like
that
sometimes
they
lay
about
them
these
police
with
their
fists
till
you
get
every
tooth
in
your
jaw
smashed
devilish
big
and
strong
these
fellows
i
can
tell
you
them
off
to
the
said
he
see
to
them
in
a
bit
as
for
you
stop
here
that
me
you
go
and
sit
down
there
where
he
pointed
to
there
was
paper
a
pen
and
ink
so
thinks
i
he
up
to
now
down
he
says
again
the
pen
and
write
and
then
he
goes
and
clutches
at
my
ear
and
gives
it
a
good
pull
i
looked
at
him
in
the
sort
of
way
the
devil
may
look
at
a
priest
ca
write
your
worship
write
mercy
on
me
your
worship
your
best
write
write
and
all
the
while
he
keeps
pulling
my
ear
pulling
and
twisting
pals
i
rather
have
had
three
hundred
strokes
of
the
cat
i
tell
you
it
was
hell
write
that
was
all
he
said
had
the
fellow
gone
mad
what
the
mischief
was
it
bless
us
no
a
little
while
before
a
secretary
had
done
a
stroke
of
business
at
tobolsk
he
had
robbed
the
local
treasury
and
gone
off
with
the
money
he
had
very
big
ears
just
as
i
have
they
had
sent
the
fact
all
over
the
country
i
answered
to
that
description
that
why
he
tormented
me
with
his
write
he
wanted
to
find
out
if
i
could
write
and
to
see
my
hand
regular
sharp
chap
that
did
it
hurt
lord
do
say
a
word
about
it
i
beg
everybody
burst
out
laughing
you
did
write
the
deuce
was
there
to
write
i
set
my
pen
going
over
the
paper
and
did
it
to
such
good
account
that
he
left
off
torturing
me
he
just
gave
me
a
dozen
thumps
regulation
allowance
and
then
let
me
go
about
my
business
to
prison
that
is
you
really
know
how
to
write
course
i
did
what
d
mean
used
to
very
well
forgotten
the
whole
blessed
thing
though
ever
since
they
began
to
use
pens
for
it
thanks
to
the
gossip
talk
of
the
convicts
who
filled
the
hospital
time
was
somewhat
quickened
for
us
but
still
almighty
god
how
wearied
and
bored
we
were
long
long
were
the
days
suffocating
in
their
monotony
one
absolutely
the
same
as
another
if
only
i
had
had
a
single
book
for
all
that
i
went
often
to
the
infirmary
especially
in
the
early
days
of
my
banishment
either
because
i
was
ill
or
because
i
needed
rest
just
to
get
out
of
the
worse
parts
of
the
prison
in
those
life
was
indeed
made
a
burden
to
us
worse
even
than
in
the
hospital
especially
as
regards
the
effect
upon
moral
sentiment
and
good
feeling
we
of
the
nobility
were
the
objects
of
envious
dislike
quarrels
picked
with
us
all
the
time
something
done
every
moment
to
put
us
in
the
wrong
looks
filled
with
menacing
hatred
unceasingly
directed
on
us
here
in
the
one
lived
on
a
sort
of
footing
of
equality
there
was
something
of
comradeship
the
most
melancholy
moment
of
the
hours
was
evening
when
night
set
in
we
went
to
bed
very
early
a
smoky
lamp
just
gave
us
one
point
of
light
at
the
very
end
of
the
room
near
the
door
in
our
corner
we
were
almost
in
complete
darkness
the
air
was
pestilential
stifling
some
of
the
sick
people
could
not
get
to
sleep
would
rise
up
and
remain
sitting
for
an
hour
together
on
their
beds
with
their
heads
bent
as
though
they
were
in
deep
reflection
these
i
would
look
at
steadily
trying
to
guess
what
they
might
be
thinking
of
thus
i
tried
to
kill
time
then
i
became
lost
in
my
own
reveries
the
past
came
up
to
me
again
showing
itself
to
my
imagination
in
large
powerful
outlines
filled
with
high
lights
and
massive
shadows
details
that
at
any
other
time
would
have
remained
in
oblivion
presented
themselves
in
vivid
force
making
on
me
an
impression
impossible
under
any
other
circumstances
then
i
would
begin
to
muse
dreamily
on
the
future
when
shall
i
leave
this
place
of
restraint
this
dreadful
prison
whither
betake
myself
what
will
then
befall
me
shall
i
return
to
the
place
of
my
birth
so
i
brood
and
brood
until
hope
lives
once
again
in
my
soul
another
time
i
would
begin
to
count
one
two
three
to
see
if
sleep
could
be
won
that
way
i
would
set
sometimes
as
far
as
three
thousand
and
was
as
wakeful
as
ever
then
somebody
would
turn
in
his
bed
then
there
oustiantsef
coughing
that
cough
of
the
consumptive
and
then
he
would
groan
feebly
and
stammer
my
god
sinned
i
sinned
how
frightful
it
was
that
voice
of
the
sick
man
that
broken
dying
voice
in
the
midst
of
that
silence
so
dead
and
complete
in
a
corner
there
are
some
sick
people
not
yet
asleep
talking
in
a
low
voice
stretched
on
their
pallets
one
of
them
is
telling
the
story
of
his
life
all
about
things
infinitely
far
off
things
that
have
fled
for
ever
he
is
talking
of
his
trampings
through
the
world
of
his
children
his
wife
the
old
ways
of
his
life
and
the
very
accent
of
the
voice
tells
you
that
all
those
things
are
for
ever
over
for
him
that
he
is
as
a
limb
cut
off
from
the
world
of
men
cut
off
thrown
aside
there
is
another
listening
intently
to
what
he
is
saying
a
weak
feeble
sort
of
muttering
and
murmuring
comes
to
one
ear
from
in
the
dreary
room
a
sound
as
of
water
flowing
somewhere
i
remember
that
one
time
during
a
winter
night
that
seemed
as
if
it
would
never
end
i
heard
a
story
which
at
first
seemed
as
if
it
were
the
stammerings
of
a
creature
in
nightmare
or
the
delirium
of
fever
here
it
is
footnote
what
i
relate
about
corporal
punishment
took
place
during
my
time
now
as
i
am
told
everything
is
changed
and
is
changing
still
chapter
iv
the
husband
of
akoulka
it
was
late
at
night
about
eleven
i
had
been
sleeping
some
time
and
woke
up
with
a
start
the
wan
and
weak
light
of
the
distant
lamp
barely
lit
the
room
nearly
everybody
was
fast
asleep
even
oustiantsef
in
the
quiet
of
the
night
i
heard
his
difficult
breathing
and
the
rattlings
in
his
throat
with
every
respiration
in
the
sounded
the
heavy
and
distant
footsteps
of
the
patrol
as
the
men
came
up
the
butt
of
a
gun
struck
the
floor
with
its
low
and
heavy
sound
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
the
corporal
counted
the
sick
stepping
softly
about
the
place
after
a
minute
or
so
he
closed
the
door
again
leaving
a
fresh
sentinel
there
the
patrol
went
off
silence
reigned
again
it
was
only
then
that
i
observed
two
prisoners
not
far
from
me
who
were
not
sleeping
and
who
seemed
to
be
holding
a
muttered
conversation
sometimes
in
fact
it
would
happen
that
a
couple
of
sick
people
whose
beds
adjoined
and
who
had
not
exchanged
a
word
for
weeks
would
all
of
a
sudden
break
out
into
conversation
with
one
another
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
one
of
them
would
tell
the
other
his
history
probably
they
had
been
speaking
for
some
considerable
time
i
did
not
hear
the
beginning
of
it
and
could
not
at
first
seize
upon
their
words
but
little
by
little
i
got
familiar
with
the
muttered
sounds
and
understood
all
that
was
going
on
i
had
not
the
least
desire
for
sleep
on
me
so
what
could
i
do
but
listen
one
of
them
was
telling
his
story
with
some
warmth
on
his
bed
with
his
head
lifted
and
stretched
towards
his
companion
he
was
plainly
excited
to
no
little
degree
the
necessity
of
speech
was
on
him
the
man
listening
was
sitting
up
on
his
pallet
with
a
gloomy
and
indifferent
air
his
legs
stretched
out
flat
on
the
mattress
and
now
and
again
murmured
some
words
in
reply
more
out
of
politeness
than
interest
and
kept
stuffing
his
nose
with
snuff
from
a
horn
box
this
was
the
soldier
techérévin
one
of
the
company
of
discipline
a
morose
pedant
an
idiot
full
of
while
the
narrator
was
chichkof
about
thirty
years
old
this
was
a
civilian
convict
whom
up
to
that
time
i
had
not
at
all
observed
and
during
the
whole
time
i
was
at
the
prison
i
never
could
get
up
the
smallest
interest
in
him
for
he
was
a
conceited
heady
fellow
sometimes
he
would
hold
his
tongue
for
weeks
together
and
look
sulky
and
brutal
enough
for
anything
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
would
strike
into
anything
that
was
going
on
behave
insufferably
go
into
a
white
heat
about
nothing
at
all
and
tell
you
long
stories
with
nothing
in
them
whatever
about
one
barrack
or
another
blowing
abuse
on
all
the
world
and
acting
like
a
man
beside
himself
then
some
one
would
give
him
a
hiding
and
he
would
have
another
fit
of
silence
he
was
a
mean
and
cowardly
fellow
and
the
object
of
general
contempt
his
stature
was
low
he
had
little
flesh
on
him
he
had
wandering
eyes
though
they
sometimes
got
mixed
and
seemed
filled
with
a
stupid
sort
of
thinking
when
he
told
you
anything
he
worked
himself
into
a
fever
gesticulated
wildly
suddenly
broke
off
and
went
to
another
subject
lost
himself
in
fresh
details
and
at
last
forgot
altogether
what
he
was
talking
about
he
often
got
into
squabbles
this
chichkof
and
when
he
poured
insult
on
his
adversary
he
spoke
with
a
sentimental
whine
and
was
affected
nearly
to
tears
he
was
not
a
bad
hand
at
playing
the
and
had
a
weakness
for
it
on
fête
days
he
would
show
you
his
dancing
powers
when
others
set
him
at
it
and
he
danced
by
no
means
badly
you
could
easily
enough
make
him
do
what
you
wanted
not
that
he
was
of
a
complying
turn
but
he
liked
to
please
and
to
get
intimate
with
fellows
for
some
considerable
time
i
could
understand
the
story
chichkoff
was
telling
that
night
i
mean
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
he
were
constantly
rambling
from
the
point
to
talk
of
something
else
perhaps
he
had
observed
that
tchérévine
was
paying
little
attention
to
the
narrative
but
i
fancy
that
he
was
minded
to
overlook
this
indifference
so
as
not
to
take
offence
when
he
went
out
on
business
he
continued
every
one
saluted
him
politely
paid
him
every
respect
a
fellow
with
money
that
you
say
that
he
was
in
some
trade
or
other
yes
trade
indeed
the
trading
class
in
my
country
is
wretchedly
just
the
women
go
to
the
river
and
fetch
water
from
ever
such
a
distance
to
water
their
gardens
they
wear
themselves
to
the
very
bone
and
for
all
that
when
winter
comes
they
have
got
enough
to
make
a
mere
cabbage
soup
i
tell
you
starvation
but
that
fellow
had
a
good
lump
of
land
which
his
labourers
cultivated
he
had
three
then
he
had
hives
and
sold
his
honey
he
was
a
too
a
much
respected
man
in
our
parts
he
was
very
old
and
quite
gray
his
seventy
years
lay
heavy
on
his
old
bones
when
he
came
to
the
with
his
pelisse
everybody
saluted
him
daddy
aukoudim
trophimtych
he
return
are
you
getting
along
he
never
looked
down
on
any
one
keep
you
aukoudim
trophimtych
goes
business
with
you
is
as
good
as
tallow
white
with
me
and
how
yours
daddy
just
got
enough
of
a
livelihood
to
pay
the
price
of
sin
always
sweating
over
our
bit
of
land
preserve
you
aukoudim
trophimtych
he
never
looked
down
on
anybody
all
his
advice
was
always
worth
having
every
one
of
his
words
was
worth
a
rouble
a
great
reader
he
was
quite
a
man
of
learning
but
he
stuck
to
religious
books
he
would
call
his
old
wife
and
say
to
her
woman
take
well
in
what
i
say
then
he
would
explain
things
his
old
marie
stépanovna
was
not
exactly
an
old
woman
if
you
please
it
was
his
second
wife
he
had
married
her
to
have
children
his
first
wife
had
not
brought
him
any
he
had
two
boys
still
quite
young
for
the
second
of
them
was
born
when
his
father
was
close
on
sixty
akoulka
his
daughter
was
eighteen
years
old
she
was
the
eldest
your
wife
is
it
so
wait
a
bit

philka
marosof

to
kick
up
a
row

difference

i

aukoudim

him
back
his
money
all
he
had
of
his
you
see
he
and
philka
father

both
put

he
said
to
philka
i
a
lost
man
or

biggest
cheat
i
know
you
try
to
screw

fortune

farthings
and
pick

all
the
dirt
about

are
piling
up
here

same

said
aukoudim
shaking
with
passion
philka
told
us
all
this
later
not
only
not
marry
your
daughter
but
i
take
good
care
that
nobody
marries
her
not
even
mikita
grigoritch
for
she
a
disreputable
girl
we
had
a
fine
time
together
she
and
i
all
last
autumn
i
want
her
at
any
price
all
the
money
in
the
world
would
make
me
take
her
then
the
fellow
went
and
had
high
jinks
for
a
while
all
the
town
was
as
one
man
in
sending
up
a
cry
against
him
he
got
a
lot
of
other
fellows
round
him
for
he
had
a
heap
of
money
three
months
he
had
of
it
such
recklessness
as
you
never
heard
of
every
penny
went
want
to
see
the
end
of
this
money
i
sell
the
house
everything
then
i
or
go
on
the
tramp
he
was
drunk
from
morning
to
evening
and
went
about
with
a
carriage
and
pair
the
girls
liked
him
well
i
tell
you
for
he
played
the
guitar
very
nicely
then
it
is
true
that
he
had
been
too
well
with
this
akoulka
wait
wait
ca
you
i
had
just
buried
my
father
my
mother
lived
by
baking
gingerbread
we
got
our
livelihood
by
working
for
aukoudim
barely
enough
to
eat
a
precious
hard
life
it
was
we
had
a
bit
of
land
the
other
side
of
the
woods
and
grew
corn
there
but
when
my
father
died
i
went
on
a
spree
i
made
my
mother
give
me
money
but
i
had
to
give
her
a
good
hiding
first
you
were
very
wrong
to
beat
her
a
great
sin
that
sometimes
i
was
drunk
the
whole
blessed
day
we
had
a
house
that
was
just
tumbling
to
pieces
with
dry
rot
still
it
was
our
own
we
were
as
near
famished
as
could
be
for
weeks
together
we
had
nothing
but
rags
to
chew
mother
nearly
killed
me
with
one
stupid
trick
or
another
but
i
did
care
a
curse
philka
marosof
and
i
were
always
together
day
and
night

guitar
to
me
he
say
i
lie
in
bed
the
while
i
throw
money
to
you
for
i
the
richest
chap
in
the
world
the
fellow
could
not
speak
without
lying
there
was
only
one
thing
he
would
touch
a
thing
if
it
had
been
stolen
no
thief
i
an
honest
man
let
go
and
daub
akoulka
door
with
pitch
for
i
have
her
marry
mikita
grigoritch
i
stick
to
that
the
old
man
had
long
meant
to
give
his
daughter
to
this
mikita
grigoritch
he
was
a
man
well
on
in
life
in
trade
too
and
wore
spectacles
when
he
heard
the
story
of
akoulka
bad
conduct
he
said
to
the
old
father
would
be
a
terrible
disgrace
for
me
aukoudim
trophimtych
on
the
whole
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
marry
it
to
late
so
we
went
and
daubed
akoulka
door
all
over
with
pitch
when

that
her
folks
beat
her
so
that
they
nearly
killed
her

while
the
old
man
said
we
were
in
the
days
of
the
patriarchs
i
have
hacked
her
to
pieces
on
a
block
but
now
everything
is
rottenness
and
corruption
in
this
world
sometimes
the
neighbours
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
heard
akoulka
screams
she
was
whipped
from
morning
to
evening
and
philka
would
cry
out
in
the
before
everybody
akoulka
a
jolly
girl
to
get
drunk
with
i
given
it
those
people
between
the
eyes
they
wo
forget
me
in
a
hurry
well
one
day
i
met
akoulka

was
going
for
water
with
her
bucket

girl
who
knows
how
to
please
fellows
who

you
get
your
money
for
your
finery
that
just
what
i
said
to
her
she
opened
her
eyes
as
wide
as
you
please
no
more
flesh
on
her
than
on
a
log
of
wood
she
had
only
just
given
me
a
look
but
her
mother
thought
she
was
larking
with
me
and
cried
from
her
hussy
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
with
that
fellow
and
from
that
moment
they
began
to
beat
her
again
sometimes
they
hided
her
for
an
hour
together
the
mother
said
give
her
the
whip
because
she
my
daughter

was
then
as
bad
as
they
said
now

my
story

hundred
roubles
with

marriage
ceremony

in
fear
of
her
life
from

the
spot
and

believe
it
unless
you
please
but
i
was
drunk
right
up
to
the
then
philka
marosof
kept
threatening
me
all
the
time

every
bone
in
your
body
a
nice
fellow

to
be
engaged
and
to
akoulka
if

and
a
liar
that
what
i
said
to
him
but
he
insulted
me
so
in
the
street
before
everybody
that
i
ran
to
and
said
wo

her
unless
i
have
fifty
roubles
down
this
moment
and
they
really
did
give
her
to
you
in
marriage
me
why
not
i
should
like
to
know
we
were
respectable
people
enough
father
had
been
ruined
by
a
fire
a
little
before
he
died
he
had
been
a
richer
man
than
aukoudim
trophimtych
fellow
without
a
shirt
to
his
back
like
you
ought
to
be
only
too
happy
to
marry
my
daughter
that
what
old
aukoudim
said
you
think
of
your
door
and
the
pitch
that
went
on
it
i
said
to
him
and
nonsense
said
he
no
proof
whatever
that
the
girl
gone
wrong
yourself
there
the
door
and
you
can
go
about
your
business
but
give
back
the
money
you
had
then
philka
marosof
and
i
settled
it
together
to
send
mitri
bykoff
to
father
aukoudim
to
tell
him
that
we
insult
him
to
his
face
before
everybody
well
i
had
my
skin
as
full
as
it
could
hold
right
up
to
the
i
was
sober
till
i
got
into
the
church
when
they
took
us
home
after
church
the
girl
uncle
mitrophone
stépanytch
said
is
a
nice
business
but
it
over
and
done
now
old
aukoudim
was
sitting
there
crying
the
tears
rolled
down
on
his
gray
beard
comrade
i
tell
you
what
i
had
done
i
had
put
a
whip
into
my
pocket
before
we
went
to
church
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
it
out
of
her
with
that
so
that
all
the
world
might
know
how
i
been
swindled
into
the
marriage
and
not
think
me
a
bigger
fool
than
i
am
i
see
and
you
wanted
her
to
know
what
was
in
store
for
her
ah
was
quiet
nunky
quiet
among
our
people
i
tell
you
how
it
is
directly
after
the
marriage
ceremony
they
take
the
couple
to
a
room
apart
and
the
others
remain
drinking
till
they
return
so
i
left
alone
with
akoulka
she
was
pale
not
a
bit
of
colour
on
her
cheeks
frightened
out
of
her
wits
she
had
fine
hair
supple
and
bright
as
flax
and
great
big
eyes
she
scarcely
ever
was
known
to
speak
you
might
have
thought
she
was
dumb
an
odd
creature
akoulka
if
ever
there
was
one
well
you
can
just
imagine
the
scene
my
whip
was
ready
on
the
bed
well
she
was
as
pure
a
girl
as
ever
was
not
a
word
of
it
all
was
true
impossible
true
i
swear
as
good
a
girl
as
any
good
family
might
wish
then
brother
why
why
why
had
she
had
to
undergo
all
that
torture
why
had
philka
marosof
slandered
her
so
yes
why
indeed
well
i
got
down
from
the
bed
and
went
on
my
knees
before
her
and
put
my
hands
together
as
if
i
were
praying
and
just
said
to
her
mother
pet
akoulka
koudimovna
forgive
me
for
having
been
such
an
idiot
as
to
believe
all
that
slander
forgive
me
i
a
hound
she
was
seated
on
the
bed
and
gazed
at
me
fixedly
she
put
her
two
hands
on
my
shoulders
and
began
to
laugh
but
the
tears
were
running
all
down
her
cheeks
she
sobbed
and
laughed
all
at
once
then
i
went
out
and
said
to
the
people
in
the
other
room
philka
marosof
look
to
himself
if
i
come
across
him
he
wo
be
long
for
this
world
the
old
people
were
beside
themselves
with
delight
akoulka
mother
was
ready
to
throw
herself
at
her
daughter
feet
and
sobbed
then
the
old
man
said
we
had
known
really
how
it
was
my
dearest
child
we
would
have
given
you
a
husband
of
that
sort
you
ought
to
have
seen
how
we
were
dressed
the
first
sunday
after
our
marriage
when
we
left
church

got
a
long
coat
of
fine
cloth
a
fur
cap
with
plush
breeches

had
a
pelisse
of
hareskin
quite
new
and
a
silk
kerchief
on
her
head

as
fine
as
the
other
everybody
admired
us
i
must
say
i
looked
well
and
pet
akoulka

to
boast
but
one
ought
to
sing
small

the
dozen

a
doubt
about
it

the
day
after
my
marriage

ran
off
from
my
guests

about
the
streets
crying
that
scoundrel
of
a
philka
marosof
just
let
him
come
near
me
the
hound
that
all
i
went
all
over

as
drunk
as
a
man
could
be
and
stand
they
went
after
me
and
caught
me
close
to
vlassof
place

three
men
to
get
me

about
it
so
off
i
went
to
the
house
and
cried
out
to
them
married
me
when
i
was
drunk
akoulka
mother
tried
to
fasten
herself
on
me
but
i
cried

do
know
about
anything
but
money
you
bring
me
akoulka
and
did
i
beat
her
i
tell
you
i
beat
her
for
two
hours
running
till
i
rolled
on
the
floor
myself
with
fatigue
she
could
leave
her
bed
for
three
weeks
it
a
dead
sure
thing
said
tchérévine
phlegmatically
if
you
beat
them
they
did
you
find
her
with
her
lover
no
to
tell
the
truth
i
never
actually
caught
her
said
chichkoff
after
a
pause
speaking
with
effort
but
i
was
hurt
a
good
deal
hurt
for
every
one
made
fun
of
me
the
cause
of
it
all
was
philka
wife
is
just
made
for
everybody
to
look
at
said
he
one
day
he
invited
us
to
see
him
and
then
he
went
at
it
just
look
what
a
good
little
wife
he
has
is
she
tender
fine
nicely
brought
up
affectionate
full
of
kindness
for
all
the
world
i
say
my
lad
have
you
forgotten
how
we
daubed
their
door
with
pitch
i
was
full
at
that
moment
drunk
as
may
be
then
he
seized
me
by
the
hair
and
had
me
down
upon
the
ground
before
i
knew
where
i
was
along
dance
are
you
akoulka
husband
i
hold
your
hair
for
you
and
you
shall
dance
it
will
be
good
fun
said
i
to
him
bring
some
jolly
fellows
to
your
house
said
he
i
whip
your
akoulka
before
your
very
eyes
just
as
long
as
i
please
would
you
believe
it
for
a
whole
month
i
dare
go
out
of
the
house
i
was
so
afraid
come
to
us
and
drag
my
wife
through
the
dirt
and
how
i
did
beat
her
for
it
what
was
the
use
of
beating
her
you
can
tie
a
woman
hands
but
not
her
tongue
you
ought
to
give
them
a
hiding
too
often
beat
a
bit
then
scold
well
then
fondle
that
what
a
woman
is
made
for
chichkoff
remained
quite
silent
for
a
few
moments
i
was
very
much
hurt
he
went
on
i
began
it
again
just
as
before
i
beat
her
from
morning
till
night
for
nothing
because
she
did
get
up
from
her
seat
the
way
i
liked
because
she
did
walk
to
suit
me
when
i
was
hiding
her
time
hung
heavy
on
my
hands
sometimes
she
sat
by
the
window
crying
silently
it
hurt
my
feelings
sometimes
to
see
her
cry
but
i
beat
her
all
the
same
sometimes
her
mother
abused
me
for
it
a
scoundrel
a
say
a
word
or
i
kill
you
you
made
me
marry
her
when
i
was
drunk
you
swindled
me
old
aukoudim
wanted
at
first
to
have
his
finger
in
the
pie
said
he
to
me
one
day
here
you
not
such
a
tremendous
fellow
that
one
put
you
down
but
he
did
get
far
on
that
track
marie
stépanovna
had
become
as
sweet
as
milk
one
day
she
came
to
me
crying
her
eyes
out
and
said
heart
is
almost
broken
ivan
semionytch
what
i
going
to
ask
of
you
is
a
little
thing
for
you
but
it
is
a
good
deal
to
me
let
her
go
let
her
leave
you
daddy
ivan
then
she
throws
herself
at
my
feet
give
up
being
so
angry
wicked
people
slander
her
you
know
quite
well
she
was
good
when
you
married
her
then
she
threw
herself
at
my
feet
again
and
cried
but
i
was
as
hard
as
nails
wo
hear
a
word
you
have
to
say
what
i
choose
to
do
i
do
to
you
or
anybody
for
crazed
with
it
all
as
to
philka
marosof
he
my
best
and
dearest
friend
you
begun
to
play
your
pranks
together
again
you
and
he
no
by
jove
he
was
out
of
the
way
by
this
time
he
was
killing
himself
with
drink
nothing
less
he
had
spent
all
he
had
on
drink
and
had
for
a
soldier
as
substitute
for
a
citizen
body
in
the
town
in
our
parts
when
a
lad
makes
up
his
mind
to
be
substitute
for
another
he
is
master
of
that
house
and
everybody
there
till
he
called
to
the
ranks
he
gets
the
sum
agreed
on
the
day
he
goes
off
but
up
to
then
he
lives
in
the
house
of
the
man
who
buys
him
sometimes
six
whole
months
and
there
is
a
horror
in
the
whole
world
those
fellows
are
not
guilty
of
it
enough
to
make
folks
take
the
holy
images
out
of
the
house
from
the
moment
he
consents
to
be
substitute
for
the
son
of
the
family
then
he
considers
himself
their
patron
and
benefactor
and
makes
them
dance
as
he
pipes
or
else
he
goes
off
the
bargain
so
philka
marosof
played
the
very
mischief
at
the
home
of
this
townsman
he
slept
with
the
daughter
pulled
the
master
of
the
house
by
the
beard
after
dinner
did
anything
that
came
into
his
head
they
had
to
heat
the
bath
for
him
every
day
and
what
more
give
him
brandy
fumes
with
the
steam
of
the
bath
and
he
would
have
the
women
lead
him
by
the
arms
to
the
bath
room
when
he
came
back
to
the
man
house
after
a
revel
elsewhere
he
would
stop
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
cry
out
wo
go
in
by
the
door
pull
down
the
fence
and
they
actually
to
pull
down
the
fence
though
there
was
the
door
right
at
it
to
let
him
in
that
all
came
to
an
end
though
the
day
they
took
him
to
the
regiment
that
day
he
was
sobered
sufficiently
the
crowd
gathered
all
through
the
street
taking
off
philka
marosof
he
made
a
salute
on
all
sides
right
and
left
just
at
that
moment
akoulka
was
returning
from
the
directly
philka
saw
her
he
cried
out
to
her
and
down
he
jumped
from
the
cart
and
threw
himself
down
at
her
feet
soul
my
sweet
little
strawberry
i
loved
you
two
years
long
now
they
taking
me
off
to
the
regiment
with
the
band
playing
forgive
me
good
honest
girl
of
a
good
honest
father
for
i
nothing
but
a
hound
and
all
you
gone
through
is
my
fault
then
he
flings
himself
down
before
her
a
second
time
at
first
akoulka
was
exceedingly
frightened
but
she
made
him
a
great
bow
which
nearly
bent
her
double
me
too
my
good
lad
but
i
am
really
not
at
all
angry
with
you
as
she
went
into
the
house
i
was
at
her
heels
did
you
say
to
him
you
you
now
you
may
believe
it
or
not
as
you
like
but
she
looked
at
me
as
bold
as
you
please
and
answered
love
him
better
than
anything
or
anybody
in
this
world
say
that
day
i
did
utter
one
single
word
only
towards
evening
i
said
to
her
i
going
to
kill
you
now
i
did
close
an
eye
the
whole
night
i
went
into
the
little
room
leading
to
ours
and
drank
kwass
at
daybreak
i
went
into
the
house
again
get
ready
and
come
into
the
fields
i
had
arranged
to
go
there
before
my
wife
knew
it
are
right

she
quite
time
to
begin
reaping
heard
that
our
labourer
is
ill
and
does
work

bit
i
put
to
the
cart
without
saying
a
word
as
you
go
out
of
the
town
there
a
forest
fifteen
versts
in
length
at
the
end
of
it
is
our
field
when
we
had
gone
about
three
versts
through
the
wood
i
stopped
the
horse
get
up
akoulka
your
end
is
come
she
looked
at
me
all
in
a
fright
and
got
up
without
a
word
tormented
me
enough
say
your
prayers
i
seized
her
by
the
hair
she
had
long
thick
tresses
i
rolled
them
round
my
arm
i
held
her
between
my
knees
took
out
my
knife
threw
her
head
back
and
cut
her
throat
she
screamed
the
blood
spurted
out
then
i
threw
away
my
knife
i
pressed
her
with
all
my
might
in
my
arms
i
put
her
on
the
ground
and
embraced
her
yelling
with
all
my
might
she
screamed
i
yelled
she
struggled
and
struggled
the
blood
her
blood
splashed
my
face
my
hands
it
was
stronger
than
i
was
stronger
then
i
took
fright
i
left
her
left
my
horse
and
began
to
run
ran
back
to
the
house
i
went
in
the
back
way
and
hid
myself
in
the
old
ramshackle
which
we
never
used
now
i
lay
myself
down
under
the
seat
and
remained
hid
till
the
dead
of
the
night
and
akoulka
she
got
up
to
come
back
to
the
house
they
found
her
later
a
hundred
steps
from
the
place
so
you
had
finished
her
no
chichkoff
stopped
a
while
yes
said
tchérévine
there
a
vein
if
you
do
cut
it
at
the
first
the
man
will
go
on
struggling
the
blood
may
flow
fast
enough
but
he
wo
die
but
she
was
dead
all
the
same
they
found
her
in
the
evening
and
she
was
cold
they
told
the
police
and
hunted
me
up
they
found
me
in
the
night
in
the
old
bath
and
there
you
have
it
i
been
four
years
here
already
added
he
after
a
pause
yes
if
you
do
beat
you
make
no
way
at
all
said
tchérévine
sententiously
taking
out
his
once
more
he
took
his
pinches
very
slowly
with
long
pauses
for
all
that
my
lad
you
behaved
like
a
fool
why
i
myself
i
came
upon
my
wife
with
a
lover
i
made
her
come
into
the
shed
and
then
i
doubled
up
a
halter
and
said
to
her
whom
did
you
swear
to
be
faithful
to
whom
did
you
swear
it
in
church
tell
me
that
and
then
i
gave
it
her
with
my
halter
beat
her
and
beat
her
for
an
hour
and
a
half
till
at
last
she
was
quite
spent
and
cried
out
wash
your
feet
and
drink
the
water
afterwards
her
name
was
crodotia
footnotes
daubing
the
door
of
a
house
where
a
young
girl
lives
is
done
to
show
that
she
is
dishonoured
a
mark
of
respect
paid
in
russia
formerly
now
disused
chapter
the
summer
season
april
is
come
holy
week
is
not
far
off
we
set
about
our
summer
tasks
the
sun
becomes
hotter
and
more
brilliant
every
day
the
atmosphere
has
the
spring
in
it
and
acts
upon
our
nervous
system
powerfully
the
convict
in
his
chains
feels
the
trembling
influence
of
the
lovely
days
like
any
other
creature
they
rouse
desires
in
him
inexpressible
longings
for
his
home
and
many
other
things
i
think
that
he
misses
his
liberty
yearns
for
freedom
more
when
the
day
is
filled
with
sunlight
than
during
the
rainy
and
melancholy
days
of
autumn
and
winter
you
may
observe
this
positively
among
convicts
if
they
feel
a
little
joy
on
a
beautiful
clear
day
they
have
a
reaction
into
greater
impatience
and
irritability
i
noticed
that
in
spring
there
was
much
more
squabbling
in
our
prison
there
was
more
noise
the
yelling
was
greater
there
were
more
fights
during
the
working
hours
we
would
see
a
man
sometimes
fixed
in
a
meditative
gaze
which
seemed
lost
in
the
blue
distance
somewhere
the
other
side
of
the
irtych
where
stretched
the
boundless
plain
with
its
flight
of
hundreds
of
versts
the
free
kirghiz
steppe
sighs
came
to
one
ear
sighs
breathed
from
the
depths
of
the
chest
it
might
seem
that
the
air
of
those
wide
and
free
regions
haunted
by
their
thought
forced
the
convicts
to
draw
deep
respirations
and
was
a
sort
of
solace
to
their
crushed
and
fettered
souls
ah
cries
at
last
the
poor
prisoner
all
at
once
with
a
long
sighing
cry
then
he
seizes
his
pick
furiously
or
picks
up
the
bricks
which
he
has
to
carry
from
one
place
to
another
but
after
a
brief
minute
he
seems
to
forget
the
passing
impression
and
begins
laughing
or
insulting
people
near
so
fitful
is
his
humour
then
he
attacks
the
work
he
has
to
do
with
unusual
fire
labours
with
might
and
main
as
if
trying
to
stifle
by
fatigue
the
grief
that
has
him
by
the
throat
you
see
they
are
fellows
of
unimpaired
vigour
all
in
the
very
flower
of
life
with
all
their
physical
and
other
strength
about
them
how
heavy
the
irons
are
during
this
season
all
this
is
not
sentimentality
it
is
the
report
of
rigorous
observation
during
the
hot
season
under
a
fiery
sun
when
all
one
being
all
one
soul
is
vividly
conscious
of
and
intimately
feels
the
unspeakably
strong
resurrection
of
nature
going
on
everywhere
it
is
more
difficult
to
support
the
confinement
the
perpetual
surveillance
the
tyranny
of
a
will
other
than
one
own
besides
this
it
is
in
spring
with
the
first
song
of
the
lark
that
throughout
all
siberia
and
russia
men
set
out
on
the
tramp
creatures
if
they
can
break
their
prison
and
escape
into
the
woods
after
the
stifling
ditch
where
they
work
after
the
boats
the
irons
the
rods
and
whips
they
go
vagabondizing
where
they
please
wherever
they
can
make
it
out
best
they
eat
and
drink
what
they
can
get
is
all
the
time
with
them
and
by
night
they
sleep
undisturbed
in
the
woods
or
in
a
field
without
a
care
without
the
agony
of
knowing
themselves
in
prison
as
if
they
were
god
own
birds
their
is
said
to
the
stars
and
the
eye
that
watches
them
is
the
eye
of
god
not
altogether
a
rosy
life
by
any
means
sometimes
hunger
and
fatigue
are
heavy
on
them
in
the
service
of
general
cuckoo
often
enough
the
wanderers
have
not
a
morsel
of
bread
to
keep
their
teeth
going
for
days
and
days
they
have
to
hide
from
everybody
run
to
earth
like
marmots
sometimes
they
are
driven
to
robbery
pillage
nay
even
murder
send
a
man
there
and
he
becomes
a
child
and
just
throws
himself
on
all
he
sees
that
is
what
people
say
of
those
transported
to
siberia
this
saying
may
be
applied
even
more
fitly
to
the
tramps
they
are
almost
all
brigands
and
thieves
by
necessity
rather
than
inclination
many
of
them
are
hardened
to
the
life
irreclaimable
there
are
convicts
who
go
off
after
having
served
their
time
even
after
they
have
been
put
on
some
land
as
their
own
they
ought
to
be
happy
in
their
new
state
with
their
daily
bread
assured
them
well
it
is
not
so
an
irresistible
impulse
sends
them
wandering
off
this
life
in
the
woods
wretched
and
fearful
as
it
is
but
still
free
and
adventurous
has
a
mysterious
seduction
for
those
who
have
experienced
it
among
these
fugitives
you
may
find
to
your
surprise
people
of
good
habit
of
mind
peaceable
temper
who
had
shown
every
promise
of
becoming
settled
creatures
good
tillers
of
the
land
a
convict
will
marry
have
children
live
for
five
years
in
the
same
place
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
will
disappear
one
fine
morning
abandoning
wife
and
children
to
the
stupefaction
of
his
family
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
one
day
i
was
shown
at
the
convict
establishment
one
of
these
deserters
of
the
family
hearthstone
he
had
committed
no
crime
at
least
he
was
under
suspicion
of
none
but
all
through
his
life
he
had
been
a
deserter
a
deserter
from
every
post
he
had
been
to
the
southern
frontier
of
the
empire
the
other
side
of
the
danube
in
the
kirghiz
steppe
in
eastern
siberia
the
caucasus
in
a
word
everywhere
who
knows
under
other
conditions
this
man
might
have
been
a
robinson
crusoe
with
the
passion
of
travel
so
on
him
these
details
i
have
from
other
convicts
for
he
did
not
like
talk
and
never
opened
his
mouth
except
when
absolutely
necessary
he
was
a
peasant
of
quite
small
size
of
some
fifty
years
very
quiet
in
demeanour
with
a
face
so
still
as
to
seem
quite
without
any
sort
of
meaning
impassive
almost
to
idiotcy
his
delight
was
to
sit
for
hours
in
the
sun
humming
a
sort
of
song
between
his
teeth
so
softly
that
five
steps
off
he
was
inaudible
his
features
were
so
to
speak
petrified
he
ate
little
principally
black
bread
he
never
bought
white
bread
or
spirits
my
belief
is
he
never
had
had
any
money
and
that
he
could
have
counted
it
if
he
had
he
was
indifferent
to
everything
sometimes
he
fed
the
prison
dogs
with
his
own
hand
a
thing
no
one
else
was
known
to
do
speaking
generally
russians
do
like
giving
dogs
things
to
eat
from
the
hand
people
said
that
he
had
been
married
twice
even
and
that
he
had
children
somewhere
why
he
had
been
sent
as
a
convict
i
have
not
the
least
idea
we
fellows
were
always
fancying
that
he
would
escape
but
his
hour
did
not
come
or
perhaps
had
come
and
gone
anyhow
he
went
through
with
his
punishment
without
resistance
he
seemed
an
element
quite
foreign
to
the
medium
wherein
he
had
his
being
an
alien
creature
still
there
was
nothing
in
this
deep
surface
calm
which
could
be
trusted
yet
after
all
what
good
would
it
have
been
to
him
to
escape
from
the
place
compared
with
life
at
the
convict
prison
the
vagabond
age
of
the
forests
is
as
the
joys
of
paradise
the
tramp
lot
is
wretched
enough
but
at
least
free
so
it
is
that
every
prisoner
all
over
the
soil
of
russia
becomes
restless
with
the
first
rays
of
the
smiling
spring
comparatively
few
form
any
settled
plan
for
flight
they
fear
the
hindrances
in
the
way
and
the
punishment
that
may
ensue
only
one
in
a
hundred
not
more
make
up
his
mind
to
it
but
how
to
do
it
is
a
thought
that
never
ceases
to
haunt
the
minds
of
the
others
filled
as
they
are
with
this
longing
anything
that
looks
like
giving
a
chance
of
success
is
a
comfort
to
them
then
they
set
about
comparing
the
facts
with
cases
of
successful
escape
i
speak
only
of
prisoners
after
and
under
sentence
for
prisoners
not
yet
tried
and
condemned
are
much
more
ready
to
try
at
an
escape
and
those
who
have
been
sentenced
rarely
get
away
unless
they
attempt
it
in
early
days
when
they
have
spent
two
or
three
years
of
their
time
they
put
them
to
a
sort
of
in
their
minds
and
conclude
that
it
is
better
to
finish
with
the
law
and
be
put
on
land
as
a
free
man
rather
than
forfeit
that
time
if
they
fail
in
escaping
which
is
always
a
possibility
certainly
not
more
than
one
convict
in
ten
succeeds
in
his
those
who
do
are
nearly
always
men
sentenced
to
an
extremely
long
punishment
or
for
life
fifteen
twenty
years
seem
like
an
eternity
to
them
then
there
is
the
branding
which
is
a
great
difficulty
in
the
way
of
complete
escape
your
is
a
technical
expression
when
a
convict
is
caught
trying
to
escape
he
is
subjected
to
formal
interrogatory
and
will
say
he
wanted
to
his
this
somewhat
literary
formula
exactly
represents
the
act
in
question
no
escaped
prisoner
ever
hopes
to
become
a
perfectly
free
man
for
he
knows
that
it
is
nearly
impossible
what
he
looks
for
is
to
be
sent
to
some
other
convict
establishment
or
to
be
put
on
the
land
or
to
be
tried
again
for
some
offence
committed
when
on
the
tramp
in
a
word
to
be
sent
anywhere
else
it
matters
not
where
so
that
he
get
out
of
his
present
prison
which
has
become
insufferable
to
him
all
these
fugitives
unless
they
find
some
unexpected
shelter
for
the
winter
unless
they
meet
some
one
interested
in
concealing
them
or
if
last
resort
they
can
not
procure
and
sometimes
a
murder
does
it
the
legal
document
which
enables
them
to
go
about
unmolested
everywhere
all
these
fugitives
present
themselves
in
crowds
during
the
autumn
in
the
towns
and
at
the
prisons
they
confess
themselves
to
be
escaped
tramps
pass
the
winter
in
jail
and
live
in
the
secret
hope
of
getting
away
the
following
summer
on
me
as
well
as
others
the
spring
exercised
its
influence
well
do
i
remember
the
avidity
with
which
my
gaze
fed
upon
the
horizon
through
the
gaps
in
the
palisades
long
long
did
i
stand
with
my
head
glued
to
the
pickets
obstinately
and
insatiably
gazing
on
the
grass
greening
in
the
ditch
surrounding
the
fortress
and
at
the
blue
of
the
distant
sky
as
it
grew
denser
and
denser
my
anguish
my
melancholy
were
heavier
on
me
as
each
day
wore
away
the
jail
became
odious
detestable
hatred
for
me
as
a
man
of
the
nobility
filled
the
hearts
of
the
convicts
during
these
first
years
and
this
feeling
of
theirs
simply
poisoned
my
life
for
me
often
did
i
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
hospital
when
there
was
no
need
of
it
merely
to
be
out
of
the
punishment
part
of
the
place
to
feel
myself
out
of
the
range
of
this
unrelenting
and
implacable
hostility
you
nobles
have
beaks
of
iron
and
you
tore
us
to
pieces
with
your
beaks
when
we
were
serfs
is
what
the
convicts
used
to
say
to
us
how
i
envied
the
people
of
the
lower
class
who
came
into
the
place
as
prisoners
it
was
different
with
them
they
were
in
comradeship
with
all
there
from
the
very
first
moment
so
was
it
that
in
the
spring
freedom
showing
herself
as
a
sort
of
phantom
of
the
season
the
joy
diffused
throughout
all
nature
translated
themselves
within
my
soul
into
a
more
than
doubled
melancholy
and
nervous
irritability
as
the
sixth
week
of
lent
came
i
had
to
go
through
my
religious
exercises
for
the
convicts
were
divided
by
the
into
seven
sections
answering
to
the
weeks
in
lent
and
these
had
to
attend
to
their
devotions
according
to
this
roster
each
section
was
composed
of
about
thirty
men
this
week
was
a
great
solace
to
me
we
went
two
or
three
times
a
day
to
the
church
which
was
close
to
the
prison
i
had
not
been
in
church
for
a
long
time
the
lenten
services
familiar
to
me
from
early
childhood
in
my
father
house
the
solemn
prayers
the
prostrations
all
stirred
in
me
the
fibres
of
the
memory
of
things
long
long
past
and
woke
my
earliest
impressions
to
fresh
life
well
do
i
remember
how
happy
i
was
when
at
morn
we
went
into
god
house
treading
the
ground
which
had
frozen
in
the
night
under
the
escort
of
soldiers
with
loaded
guns
the
escort
remained
outside
the
church
once
within
we
were
massed
close
to
the
door
so
that
we
could
scarcely
hear
anything
except
the
deep
voice
of
the
ministering
deacon
now
and
again
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
chasuble
or
the
bare
head
of
the
priest
then
it
came
into
my
mind
how
when
a
child
i
used
to
look
at
the
common
people
who
formed
a
compact
mass
at
the
door
and
how
they
would
step
back
in
a
servile
way
before
some
important
epauletted
fellow
or
some
nobleman
with
a
big
paunch
some
lady
splendidly
dressed
and
of
high
devotion
who
in
a
hurry
to
get
at
the
front
benches
and
ready
for
a
row
if
there
was
any
difficulty
as
to
their
being
honoured
with
the
best
of
places
as
it
seemed
to
me
then
it
was
only
near
the
church
door
not
far
from
the
entry
that
prayer
was
put
up
with
genuine
fervour
and
humility
only
there
that
when
people
did
prostrate
themselves
on
the
floor
it
was
done
with
real
abasement
of
self
and
full
sense
of
unworthiness
and
now
i
myself
was
in
that
place
of
the
common
people
no
not
in
their
place
for
we
who
were
there
were
in
chains
and
degradation
everybody
kept
himself
at
a
distance
from
us
we
were
feared
and
alms
were
put
in
our
hands
as
if
we
were
beggars
i
remember
that
all
this
gave
me
the
strange
sensation
of
a
refined
and
subtle
pleasure
let
it
even
be
so
such
was
my
thought
the
convicts
prayed
with
deep
fervour
every
one
of
them
had
with
him
his
poor
farthing
for
a
little
candle
or
for
their
collection
for
the
church
expenses
i
too
i
am
a
man
each
one
of
them
perhaps
said
as
he
made
his
offering
before
god
we
are
all
equal
after
the
six
mass
we
went
up
to
communion
when
the
priest
in
hand
recited
the
words
have
mercy
on
me
as
thou
hadst
on
the
thief
whom
thou
didst
save
nearly
all
the
convicts
prostrated
themselves
and
their
chains
clanked
i
think
they
took
these
words
literally
as
applied
to
themselves
and
not
as
being
in
scripture
holy
week
came
the
authorities
presented
each
of
us
with
an
easter
egg
and
a
small
piece
of
wheaten
bread
the
townspeople
loaded
us
with
benevolences
as
at
christmas
there
was
the
priest
visitation
with
the
cross
inspecting
visit
of
the
heads
of
departments
larded
cabbage
general
enlargement
of
soul
and
unlimited
lounging
the
only
difference
being
that
one
could
now
walk
about
in
the
and
warm
oneself
in
the
sun
everything
seemed
filled
with
more
light
larger
than
in
the
winter
but
also
more
fraught
with
sadness
the
long
endless
summer
days
seemed
peculiarly
unbearable
on
church
holidays
work
days
were
at
least
shortened
to
our
sense
by
the
fatigue
of
work
our
summer
labours
were
much
more
trying
than
the
winter
tasks
our
business
was
principally
that
of
carrying
out
engineering
works
the
convicts
were
set
to
building
digging
bricklaying
or
repairing
government
buildings
locksmith
work
or
carpentering
or
painting
others
went
into
the
and
that
was
looked
upon
by
us
as
the
hardest
of
all
we
had
laid
on
us
the
were
situated
about
four
versts
from
the
fortress
through
all
the
summer
they
sent
there
every
morning
at
six
a
gang
of
fifty
convicts
for
this
gang
they
used
to
pick
out
workmen
who
had
learned
no
trade
in
particular
the
convicts
took
with
them
their
bread
for
the
day
the
distance
was
too
great
for
them
to
come
back
eight
useless
versts
for
dinner
with
the
others
so
they
had
a
meal
when
they
returned
in
the
evening
work
was
assigned
to
each
for
the
day
but
there
was
so
much
of
it
that
it
was
all
a
man
could
do
nay
more
to
get
to
the
end
of
it
first
we
had
to
dig
and
carry
the
clay
moisten
it
and
mould
it
in
the
ditch
and
then
make
a
goodly
quantity
of
bricks
two
hundred
or
so
sometimes
fifty
more
than
that
i
was
only
twice
sent
to
the
the
convicts
sent
to
this
labour
came
back
in
the
evening
dead
tired
and
every
one
of
them
complained
of
the
others
that
he
had
had
the
worst
of
the
work
put
on
him
i
believe
that
reproaches
of
this
kind
were
a
pleasure
a
consolation
to
them
some
of
them
however
liked
the
work
because
they
got
away
from
the
town
and
to
the
banks
of
the
irtych
into
open
agreeable
country
with
the
sky
overhead
the
surroundings
were
more
agreeable
than
those
frightful
government
buildings
they
were
allowed
to
smoke
there
in
all
freedom
and
to
remain
lying
down
for
or
so
which
was
a
great
pleasure
as
for
me
i
was
sent
to
one
of
the
shops
or
else
to
pound
up
alabaster
or
to
carry
bricks
which
last
job
i
had
for
two
months
together
i
had
to
take
my
tale
of
bricks
from
the
banks
of
the
irtych
to
a
distance
of
about
yards
and
to
pass
the
ditch
of
the
fortress
before
getting
to
the
barrack
which
they
were
putting
up
this
work
suited
me
well
enough
although
the
cord
with
which
i
carried
my
bricks
sawed
my
shoulders
what
particularly
pleased
me
was
that
my
strength
increased
sensibly
at
the
outset
i
could
not
carry
more
than
eight
bricks
at
once
each
of
them
weighed
about
twelve
pounds
i
got
to
be
able
to
carry
twelve
or
even
fifteen
which
delighted
me
much
you
wanted
physical
as
well
as
moral
strength
to
be
able
to
bear
all
the
discomforts
of
that
accursed
life
there
was
this
too
i
wanted
when
i
left
the
place
really
to
live
not
to
be
i
took
pleasure
in
carrying
my
bricks
then
it
was
not
merely
that
this
labour
strengthened
my
body
but
because
it
took
me
always
to
the
banks
of
the
irtych
i
speak
often
of
this
spot
it
was
the
only
one
where
we
saw
god
world
a
pure
and
bright
horizon
the
free
desert
steppes
whose
bareness
always
produced
a
strange
impression
on
me
all
the
other
workyards
were
in
the
fortress
itself
or
in
its
neighbourhood
and
the
fortress
from
the
earliest
days
i
was
there
was
the
object
of
my
hatred
and
above
all
its
appurtenant
buildings
the
house
of
the
major
commandant
seemed
to
me
a
repulsive
accursed
place
i
never
could
pass
it
without
casting
upon
it
a
look
of
detestation
while
at
the
i
could
forget
my
miserable
self
as
i
sent
my
gaze
over
the
immense
desert
space
just
as
a
prisoner
may
when
he
looks
at
the
world
of
freedom
through
the
barred
casement
of
his
dungeon
everything
in
that
place
was
dear
and
gracious
to
my
eyes
the
sun
shining
in
the
infinite
blue
of
heaven
the
distant
song
of
the
kirghiz
that
came
from
the
opposite
bank
sometimes
i
would
fix
my
sight
for
a
long
while
upon
the
poor
smoky
cabin
of
some
i
would
study
the
bluish
smoke
as
it
curled
in
the
air
the
kirghiz
woman
busy
with
her
two
sheep
the
things
i
saw
were
wild
savage
but
they
were
free
i
would
follow
the
flight
of
a
bird
threading
its
way
in
the
pure
transparent
air
now
it
skims
the
water
now
disappears
in
the
azure
sky
now
suddenly
comes
to
view
again
a
mere
point
in
space
even
the
poor
wee
floweret
fading
in
a
cleft
of
the
bank
which
would
show
itself
when
spring
began
fixed
my
attention
and
would
draw
my
tears
the
melancholy
of
this
first
year
of
convict
life
and
hard
labour
was
unendurable
too
much
for
my
strength
the
anguish
of
it
was
so
great
i
could
not
notice
my
immediate
surroundings
at
all
i
merely
shut
my
eyes
and
would
not
see
among
the
creatures
with
spoiled
lives
with
whom
i
had
to
live
i
did
not
yet
note
those
who
were
capable
of
thinking
and
feeling
in
spite
of
their
external
repulsiveness
there
came
not
to
my
ears
or
if
there
did
i
knew
it
not
one
word
of
kindliness
in
the
midst
of
the
rain
of
poisonous
talk
that
came
down
all
the
time
still
one
such
utterance
there
was
simple
straightforward
of
pure
motive
and
it
came
from
the
heart
of
a
man
who
had
suffered
and
endured
more
than
myself
but
it
is
useless
to
enlarge
on
this
the
great
fatigue
i
underwent
was
a
source
of
satisfaction
it
gave
me
hope
of
sound
sleep
during
the
summer
sleep
was
torment
more
intolerable
than
the
closeness
and
infection
winter
brought
with
it
some
of
the
nights
were
certainly
very
beautiful
the
sun
which
had
not
ceased
to
inundate
the
all
the
day
hid
itself
at
last
the
air
freshened
and
the
night
the
night
of
the
steppe
became
comparatively
cold
the
convicts
until
shut
up
in
their
barracks
walked
about
in
groups
especially
on
the
kitchen
side
for
that
was
the
place
where
questions
of
general
interest
were
by
preference
discussed
and
comments
were
made
upon
the
rumours
from
without
often
absurd
indeed
but
always
keenly
exciting
to
these
men
cut
off
from
the
world
for
example
we
suddenly
learn
that
our
major
had
been
roughly
dismissed
from
his
post
convicts
are
as
credulous
as
children
they
know
the
news
to
be
false
or
most
unlikely
and
that
the
fellow
who
brings
it
is
a
past
master
in
the
art
of
lying
kvassoff
for
all
that
they
clutch
at
the
nonsensical
story
go
into
high
delight
over
it
are
much
consoled
and
at
last
quite
ashamed
to
have
been
duped
by
a
kvassoff
i
should
like
to
know
who
show
the
door
cries
one
convict
do
you
fear
he
a
fellow
who
knows
how
to
stick
on
but
says
another
he
has
his
superiors
over
him
this
one
is
a
warm
controversialist
and
has
seen
the
world
wolves
do
feed
on
one
another
says
a
third
gloomily
half
to
himself
one
is
an
old
fellow
growing
gray
and
he
always
takes
his
sour
cabbage
soup
into
a
corner
and
eats
it
there
do
you
think
his
superiors
will
take
advice
whether
they
shall
show
him
the
door
or
not
adds
a
fourth
who
does
seem
to
care
about
it
at
all
giving
a
stroke
to
his
balalaïka
well
why
not
replies
the
second
angrily
if
you
asked
answer
what
in
your
mind
but
no
with
us
fellows
it
all
mere
cry
and
when
you
ought
to
go
at
things
with
a
will
everybody
sneaks
out
that
says
the
one
playing
with
the
balalaïka
hard
labour
and
prison
are
just
the
things
to
cause
it
was
like
that
the
other
day
says
the
second
one
without
hearing
the
remark
made
to
him
there
was
a
little
wheat
left
sweepings
a
mere
nothing
there
was
some
idea
of
turning
the
refuse
into
money
well
look
here
they
took
it
to
him
and
he
confiscated
it
all
economy
you
see
was
that
and
was
it
right
yes
or
no
but
whom
can
you
complain
to
to
whom
why
the
who
coming
what
it
true
pals
a
is
coming
soon
said
a
youthful
convict
who
had
got
some
sort
of
knowledge
had
read
the
duchesse
de
la
vallière
or
some
book
of
that
sort
and
who
had
been
quartermaster
in
a
regiment
a
bit
of
a
wag
whom
as
a
man
of
information
the
convicts
held
in
a
sort
of
respect
without
paying
the
least
attention
to
the
exciting
debate
he
goes
straight
to
the
cook
and
asks
him
for
some
liver
our
cooks
often
deal
in
victuals
of
that
kind
they
used
to
buy
a
whole
liver
cut
it
in
pieces
and
sell
it
to
the
other
convicts
two
kopecks
worth
or
four
asks
cook
a
cut
i
eat
the
others
shall
look
on
and
long
says
this
convict
yes
pals
a
general
a
real
general
is
coming
from
petersburg
to
all
siberia
it
so
heard
it
at
the
place
this
news
produces
an
extraordinary
effect
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
ask
each
other
who
this
general
can
be
what
his
title
whether
his
grade
is
higher
than
that
of
the
generals
of
our
town
the
convicts
delight
in
discussing
ranks
and
degrees
in
finding
out
who
at
the
head
of
things
who
can
make
the
other
officials
crook
their
backs
and
to
whom
he
crooks
his
own
so
they
get
up
an
argument
and
quarrel
about
their
generals
and
rude
words
fly
about
all
in
honour
of
these
high
officers
fights
too
sometimes
what
interest
can
possibly
have
in
it
when
one
hears
convicts
speaking
of
generals
and
high
officials
one
gets
a
measure
of
their
intelligence
as
they
were
while
still
in
the
world
before
the
prison
days
it
can
not
be
concealed
that
among
our
people
even
in
much
higher
circles
talk
about
generals
and
high
officials
is
looked
upon
as
the
most
serious
and
refined
conversation
well
you
see
they
sent
our
major
to
the
right
about
ye
observes
kvassoff
a
little
rubicund
choleric
fellow
the
same
who
had
announced
the
supersession
of
the
major
we
just
grease
their
palm
for
them
this
in
staccato
tones
from
the
morose
old
fellow
in
the
corner
who
had
finished
his
sour
cabbage
soup
i
should
think
he
would
grease
their
palms
by
jove
says
another
he
has
stolen
money
enough
the
brigand
and
only
think
he
was
only
a
regimental
major
before
he
came
here
he
feathered
his
nest
why
a
little
while
ago
he
was
engaged
to
the
head
priest
daughter
but
he
did
get
married
they
turned
him
off
and
that
shows
poor
a
pretty
sort
of
fellow
to
get
engaged
he
got
nothing
but
the
coat
on
his
back
last
year
easter
time
he
lost
all
he
had
at
cards
fedka
told
me
so
well
well
pals
i
been
married
myself
but
it
a
bad
thing
for
a
poor
devil
taking
a
wife
is
soon
done
but
the
fun
of
it
is
more
like
an
inch
than
a
mile
observes
skouratoff
who
had
just
joined
in
the
general
talk
do
you
fancy
we
going
to
amuse
ourselves
by
discussing
says
the
in
a
superior
manner
kvassoff
i
tell
you
a
big
idiot
if
you
fancy
that
the
major
can
grease
the
palm
of
an
you
got
things
finely
muddled
d
fancy
they
send
a
man
from
petersburg
just
to
inspect
your
major
you
a
precious
dolt
my
lad
take
it
from
me
that
it
is
so
and
you
fancy
because
he
a
general
he
does
take
what
offered
said
some
one
in
the
crowd
in
a
sceptical
tone
i
should
think
he
did
indeed
and
plenty
of
it
whenever
he
can
a
dead
sure
thing
that
gets
bigger
and
more
and
worse
the
higher
the
rank
a
general
has
his
palm
greased
says
kvassoff
sententiously
did
ever
give
them
money
as
you
so
sure
of
it
asks
baklouchin
suddenly
striking
in
in
a
tone
of
contempt
come
now
did
you
ever
see
a
general
in
all
your
life
yes
liar
liar
yourself
well
boys
as
he
seen
a
general
let
him
say
come
quick
about
it
i
know
all
every
man
jack
i
seen
general
zibert
says
kvassoff
in
tones
far
from
sure
zibert
there
no
general
of
that
name
that
the
general
perhaps
who
was
looking
at
your
back
when
they
gave
you
the
cat
this
zibert
was
perhaps
a
but
you
were
in
such
a
fright
just
then
you
took
him
for
a
general
no
just
hear
me
cries
skouratoff
for
i
got
a
wife
there
was
really
a
general
of
that
name
a
german
but
a
russian
subject
he
confessed
to
the
pope
every
year
all
about
his
peccadilloes
with
gay
women
and
drank
water
like
a
duck
at
least
forty
glasses
of
moskva
water
one
after
the
other
that
was
the
way
he
got
cured
of
some
disease
i
had
it
from
his
valet
i
say
and
the
carp
did
swim
in
his
belly
this
from
the
convict
with
the
balalaïka
be
quiet
fellows
ca
you
one
talking
seriously
and
there
they
are
beginning
their
nonsense
again
who
the
that
coming
this
was
put
by
a
convict
who
always
seemed
full
of
business
martinof
an
old
man
who
had
been
in
the
hussars
set
of
lying
fellows
said
one
of
the
doubters
lord
knows
where
they
get
it
all
from
it
all
empty
talk
it
nothing
of
the
sort
observes
koulikoff
majestically
silent
hitherto
in
dogmatic
tones
the
man
coming
is
big
and
fat
about
fifty
years
with
regular
features
and
proud
contemptuous
manners
on
which
he
prides
himself
koulikoff
is
a
tsigan
a
sort
of
veterinary
surgeon
makes
money
by
treating
horses
in
town
and
sells
wine
in
our
prison
he
no
fool
plenty
of
brain
memory
well
stocked
lets
his
words
fall
as
carefully
as
if
every
one
of
was
worth
a
rouble
it
true
he
went
on
very
calmly
i
heard
of
it
only
last
week
a
general
with
bigger
epaulettes
than
most
and
he
going
to
inspect
all
siberia
they
grease
his
palm
well
for
him
that
sure
enough
but
not
our
major
with
his
eight
eyes
in
his
head
he
wo
dare
to
creep
in
about
for
you
see
pals
there
are
generals
and
generals
as
there
are
fagots
and
fagots
it
just
this
and
you
may
take
it
from
me
our
major
will
remain
where
he
is
fellows
with
no
tongue
we
no
right
to
speak
and
as
to
our
chiefs
here
they
not
going
to
say
a
word
against
him
the
will
come
into
our
jail
give
a
look
round
and
go
off
at
once
he
say
it
was
all
right
yes
but
the
major
in
a
fright
he
been
drunk
since
morning
and
this
evening
he
had
two
of
things
taken
away
fedka
says
so
you
may
scrub
a
nigger
he
never
be
white
is
it
the
first
time
you
seen
him
drunk
hey
no
it
will
be
a
devil
of
a
shame
if
the
general
does
nothing
to
him
said
the
convicts
who
began
to
get
highly
excited
the
news
of
the
arrival
of
the
inspector
went
through
the
prison
the
prisoners
went
everywhere
about
the
retailing
the
important
fact
some
held
their
tongues
and
kept
cool
trying
to
look
important
some
were
really
indifferent
to
it
some
of
the
convicts
sat
down
on
the
steps
of
the
doors
to
play
the
balalaïka
while
some
went
on
with
their
gossip
some
groups
were
singing
in
a
drawling
voice
but
the
whole
was
upset
and
excited
generally
about
nine
they
counted
us
and
quartered
us
in
our
barracks
which
were
closed
for
the
night
a
short
summer
night
it
was
so
we
were
roused
up
at
five
in
the
morning
yet
nobody
had
managed
to
sleep
before
eleven
for
up
to
that
hour
there
was
conversation
and
all
sort
of
movement
was
going
on
sometimes
too
games
of
cards
were
made
up
as
in
winter
the
heat
was
intolerable
stifling
true
the
open
window
let
in
some
of
the
cool
night
air
but
the
convicts
kept
tossing
themselves
on
their
wooden
beds
as
if
delirious
fleas
countless
there
were
enough
of
them
in
winter
but
when
spring
came
they
multiplied
in
proportions
so
formidable
that
i
believe
it
before
i
had
to
endure
them
and
as
the
summer
went
on
the
worse
it
was
with
them
i
found
out
that
one
get
used
to
fleas
but
for
all
that
the
torment
of
them
is
so
great
that
it
throws
you
into
a
fever
even
when
you
get
slumber
you
quite
feel
it
is
not
sleep
you
are
half
delirious
and
know
it
at
last
towards
morning
when
the
enemy
is
tired
and
you
are
deliciously
asleep
in
the
freshness
of
the
early
hours
suddenly
sounds
the
pitiless
morning
how
you
curse
as
you
hear
them
those
sharp
quick
strokes
you
cower
in
your
and
then
you
ca
help
it
comes
the
thought
that
it
will
be
so
the
day
after
for
many
many
years
till
you
are
set
at
liberty
when
it
come
this
freedom
freedom
where
it
in
this
world
is
it
hiding
you
to
get
up
they
are
walking
about
you
in
all
directions
the
usual
noisy
row
begins
the
convicts
dress
and
hurry
to
their
work
it
true
you
have
an
hour
you
can
spend
in
sleep
at
noon
what
we
had
been
told
about
the
inspector
was
really
true
the
reports
were
more
confirmed
every
day
and
at
last
it
became
certain
that
a
general
high
in
office
was
coming
from
petersburg
to
inspect
all
siberia
that
he
was
already
at
tobolsk
every
day
we
learned
something
fresh
about
it
these
rumours
came
from
the
town
they
told
us
that
there
was
alarm
in
all
quarters
and
that
everybody
was
making
preparations
to
show
himself
in
as
favourable
a
light
as
might
be
the
authorities
were
organising
receptions
balls
fêtes
of
every
kind
gangs
of
convicts
were
sent
to
level
the
ways
in
the
fortress
smooth
away
hummocks
in
the
ground
paint
the
palings
and
other
to
plaster
do
up
and
generally
repair
everything
that
was
conspicuous
our
prisoners
perfectly
well
understood
the
object
of
this
labour
and
their
discussions
became
all
the
more
animated
and
excited
their
imaginations
passed
all
bounds
they
even
set
about
formulating
some
demands
to
be
set
before
the
general
on
his
arrival
but
that
did
not
prevent
their
going
on
with
their
quarrels
and
violent
speeches
our
major
was
on
hot
coals
he
came
continually
to
visit
the
jail
shouted
and
threw
himself
angrily
on
the
fellows
more
than
usual
sent
them
to
the
and
punishment
for
a
mere
nothing
and
watched
very
severely
over
the
cleanliness
and
good
order
of
the
barracks
just
then
there
occurred
a
little
event
which
did
not
at
all
painfully
affect
this
officer
as
one
might
have
expected
but
on
the
contrary
caused
him
a
lively
satisfaction
one
of
the
convicts
struck
another
with
an
awl
right
in
the
chest
in
a
place
quite
near
the
heart
the
delinquent
name
was
lomof
the
name
the
victim
was
known
by
in
the
jail
was
gavrilka
he
was
one
of
those
seasoned
tramps
i
spoken
about
earlier
whether
he
had
any
other
name
i
do
know
i
never
heard
any
attributed
to
him
except
that
one
gavrilka
lomof
had
been
a
peasant
comfortably
off
in
the
government
of
t
and
district
of
k
there
were
five
of
them
living
together
two
brothers
lomof
and
three
sons
they
were
quite
rich
peasants
the
talk
throughout
the
district
was
that
they
had
more
than
roubles
in
paper
money
they
worked
at
currying
and
tanning
but
their
chief
business
was
usury
harbouring
tramps
and
receiving
stolen
goods
all
sorts
of
petty
irregular
doings
half
the
peasants
of
their
district
owed
them
money
and
so
were
in
their
clutches
they
passed
for
being
intelligent
and
full
of
cunning
and
gave
themselves
very
great
airs
a
great
personage
of
their
province
had
stopped
on
his
way
once
at
the
father
lomof
house
and
this
official
had
taken
a
fancy
to
him
because
of
his
hardy
and
unscrupulous
talk
then
they
took
it
in
their
heads
they
might
do
exactly
as
they
pleased
and
mixed
themselves
up
more
and
more
with
illegal
doings
everybody
had
a
grievance
against
them
and
would
like
to
have
seen
them
a
hundred
feet
under
the
ground
but
they
got
bolder
and
bolder
every
day
they
were
not
afraid
of
the
local
police
or
the
district
tribunals
at
last
fortune
betrayed
them
their
ruin
came
not
out
of
their
secret
crimes
but
from
an
accusation
which
was
all
calumny
and
falsehood
ten
versts
from
their
hamlet
they
had
a
farm
where
six
kirghiz
labourers
long
since
brought
down
by
them
to
be
no
better
than
slaves
used
to
pass
the
autumn
one
fine
day
these
kirghiz
were
found
murdered
an
inquiry
was
set
on
foot
that
lasted
long
thanks
to
which
no
end
of
atrocious
things
were
brought
to
light
the
lomofs
were
accused
of
having
assassinated
their
workmen
they
had
themselves
told
their
story
to
the
convicts
all
the
jail
knew
it
perfectly
they
were
suspected
of
owing
a
great
deal
of
money
to
the
kirghiz
and
as
they
were
full
of
greed
and
avarice
in
spite
of
their
large
fortunes
it
was
believed
they
had
paid
the
debt
by
taking
the
lives
of
the
poor
fellows
while
the
inquiry
and
trial
went
on
their
property
melted
away
utterly
the
father
died
the
sons
were
transported
one
of
these
with
the
uncle
was
condemned
to
fifteen
years
of
hard
labour
now
they
were
perfectly
innocent
of
the
crime
imputed
to
them
one
fine
day
gavrilka
a
rascal
known
as
a
tramp
but
of
very
gay
and
lively
turn
avowed
himself
the
author
of
the
crime
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
know
whether
he
actually
made
this
avowal
himself
but
what
is
sure
is
that
the
convicts
held
him
to
be
the
murderer
of
the
kirghiz
this
gavrilka
while
still
tramping
about
had
been
mixed
up
in
some
way
with
the
lomofs
his
confinement
in
one
jail
was
for
quite
a
short
sentence
for
desertion
from
the
army
and
tramping
he
had
cut
the
throats
of
the
kirghiz
three
other
marauding
fellows
had
been
in
it
with
him
in
the
hope
of
setting
themselves
up
a
bit
with
the
plunder
of
the
farm
the
lomofs
were
no
favourites
with
us
i
really
do
know
why
one
of
them
the
nephew
was
a
sturdy
fellow
intelligent
and
sociable
but
his
uncle
the
one
that
struck
gavrilka
with
the
awl
was
a
choleric
stupid
rustic
always
quarrelling
with
the
convicts
who
knocked
him
about
like
plaster
all
the
jail
liked
gavrilka
for
his
gaiety
and
the
lomofs
got
to
know
like
the
rest
that
he
was
the
man
who
committed
the
crime
they
were
condemned
for
but
they
never
got
into
any
quarrel
with
him
gavrilka
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
them
the
row
with
uncle
lomof
began
about
some
disgusting
girl
they
had
quarrelled
over
gavrilka
had
boasted
of
the
favour
she
had
shown
him
the
peasant
mad
with
jealousy
ended
by
driving
an
awl
into
his
chest
although
the
lomofs
had
been
ruined
by
their
trial
and
sentence
they
passed
in
the
jail
for
being
very
rich
they
had
money
a
samovar
and
drank
tea
our
major
knew
all
about
it
and
hated
the
two
lomofs
sparing
them
no
vexation
the
victims
of
his
hate
explained
it
by
a
desire
to
have
them
grease
his
palm
well
but
they
could
not
or
would
not
bring
themselves
to
do
it
if
uncle
lomof
had
struck
his
awl
one
hair
breadth
further
in
gavrilka
breast
he
would
certainly
have
killed
him
as
it
was
the
wound
did
not
much
signify
the
affair
was
reported
to
the
major
i
think
i
see
him
now
as
he
came
up
out
of
breath
but
with
visible
satisfaction
he
addressed
gavrilka
in
an
affable
fatherly
way
tell
me
lad
can
you
walk
to
the
hospital
or
must
they
carry
you
there
no
i
think
it
will
be
better
to
have
a
horse
let
them
put
a
horse
to
this
moment
he
cried
out
to
the
with
a
gasp
but
i
do
feel
it
at
all
your
worship
he
only
given
me
a
bit
of
a
prick
your
worship
you
do
know
my
dear
fellow
you
do
know
you
see
a
nasty
place
he
struck
you
in
all
depends
upon
the
place
he
has
given
it
you
just
below
the
heart
the
scoundrel
wait
wait
he
howled
to
lomof
i
got
you
tight
take
him
to
the
he
kept
his
promise
lomof
was
tried
and
though
the
wound
was
slight
there
was
plainly
malice
aforethought
his
sentence
of
hard
labour
was
extended
for
several
years
and
they
gave
him
a
thousand
strokes
with
the
rod
the
major
was
delighted
the
inspector
arrived
at
last
the
day
after
he
reached
the
town
he
came
to
the
convict
establishment
to
make
his
inspection
it
was
a
regular
for
some
days
everything
had
been
brilliantly
clean
washed
with
great
precision
the
convicts
were
all
just
shaven
their
linen
quite
white
and
without
a
stain
according
to
the
regulations
they
wore
in
summer
waistcoats
and
pantaloons
of
canvas
every
one
had
a
round
black
piece
sown
in
at
the
back
eight
centimetres
in
diameter
for
a
whole
hour
the
prisoners
had
been
drilled
as
to
what
they
should
answer
the
very
words
to
be
used
particularly
if
the
high
functionary
should
take
any
notice
of
them
there
had
been
even
regular
rehearsals
the
major
seemed
to
have
lost
his
head
an
hour
before
the
coming
in
of
the
inspector
all
the
convicts
were
at
their
posts
as
stiff
as
statues
with
their
little
fingers
on
the
seams
of
their
pantaloons
at
last
just
about
one
the
inspector
made
his
entry
he
was
a
general
with
a
most
bearing
so
much
so
that
the
mere
sight
of
it
must
have
sent
a
tremor
into
the
hearts
of
all
the
officials
of
west
siberia
he
came
in
with
a
stern
and
majestic
air
followed
by
a
crowd
of
generals
and
colonels
doing
service
in
our
town
there
was
a
civilian
too
of
high
stature
and
regular
features
in
and
shoes
this
personage
bore
himself
very
independently
and
airily
and
the
general
addressed
him
every
moment
with
exquisite
politeness
this
civilian
also
had
come
from
petersburg
all
the
convicts
were
terribly
curious
as
to
who
he
could
be
such
an
important
general
showing
him
such
deference
we
learned
who
he
was
and
what
his
office
later
but
he
was
a
good
deal
talked
about
before
we
knew
our
major
all
spick
and
span
with
collar
made
no
too
favourable
impression
upon
the
general
the
eyes
and
fiery
rubicund
complexion
plainly
told
their
own
story
out
of
respect
for
his
superior
he
had
taken
off
his
spectacles
and
stood
some
way
off
as
straight
as
a
dart
in
feverish
expectation
that
something
would
be
asked
of
him
that
he
might
run
and
carry
out
his
excellency
wishes
but
no
particular
need
of
his
services
seemed
to
be
felt
the
general
went
all
through
the
barracks
without
saying
a
word
threw
a
glance
into
the
kitchen
where
he
tasted
the
sour
cabbage
soup
they
pointed
me
out
to
him
telling
him
that
i
was
an
who
had
done
this
that
and
the
other
ah
answered
the
general
and
how
does
he
conduct
himself
satisfactorily
for
the
time
being
your
excellency
satisfactorily
the
general
nodded
and
left
the
jail
in
a
couple
of
minutes
more
the
convicts
were
dazzled
and
disappointed
and
did
not
know
what
to
be
at
as
to
laying
complaints
against
the
major
that
was
quite
over
could
not
be
thought
of
he
had
no
doubt
been
quite
well
assured
as
to
this
beforehand
chapter
vi
the
animals
at
the
convict
establishment
gniedko
a
bay
horse
was
bought
a
little
while
afterwards
and
the
event
furnished
a
much
more
agreeable
and
interesting
diversion
to
the
convicts
than
the
visit
of
the
high
personage
i
have
been
talking
about
we
required
a
horse
at
the
jail
for
carrying
water
refuse
matter
etc
he
was
given
to
a
convict
to
take
care
of
and
use
this
man
drove
him
under
escort
of
course
our
horse
had
plenty
to
do
morning
and
night
it
was
a
worthy
sort
of
beast
but
a
good
deal
worn
and
had
been
in
service
for
a
long
time
already
one
fine
morning
the
eve
of
peter
day
gniedko
our
bay
who
was
dragging
a
barrel
of
water
fell
all
of
a
heap
and
gave
up
the
ghost
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
much
regretted
so
all
the
convicts
gathered
round
him
to
discuss
his
death
those
who
had
served
in
the
cavalry
the
tsigans
the
veterinary
fellows
and
others
showed
a
profound
knowledge
of
horses
in
general
and
fiercely
argued
the
question
but
all
that
did
not
bring
our
bay
horse
to
life
again
there
he
was
stretched
out
and
dead
with
his
belly
all
swollen
every
one
thought
it
incumbent
on
him
to
feel
about
the
poor
thing
with
his
hands
finally
the
major
was
informed
of
what
providence
had
done
in
the
horse
case
and
it
was
decided
that
another
should
be
bought
at
once
peter
day
quite
early
after
mass
all
the
convicts
being
together
horses
that
were
on
sale
were
brought
in
it
was
left
to
the
prisoners
to
choose
an
animal
for
there
were
some
thorough
experts
among
them
and
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
take
in
men
with
whom
had
been
a
speciality
tsigans
lesghians
professional
townsmen
came
in
to
deal
the
convicts
were
exceedingly
eager
about
the
matter
as
each
fresh
horse
was
brought
up
and
were
as
amused
as
children
about
it
all
it
seemed
to
tickle
their
fancy
very
much
that
they
had
to
buy
a
horse
like
free
men
just
as
if
it
was
for
themselves
and
the
money
was
to
come
out
of
their
own
pockets
three
horses
were
brought
and
taken
away
before
purchase
the
fourth
was
settled
on
the
seemed
astonished
and
a
little
awed
at
the
soldiers
of
the
escort
who
watched
the
business
two
hundred
men
clean
shaven
branded
as
they
were
with
chains
on
their
feet
were
well
calculated
to
inspire
respect
all
the
more
as
they
were
in
their
own
place
at
home
so
to
speak
in
their
own
convict
den
where
nobody
was
ever
allowed
to
come
our
fellows
seemed
to
be
up
to
no
end
of
tricks
for
finding
out
the
real
value
of
a
horse
brought
up
they
carefully
examined
it
handled
it
with
the
most
serious
demeanour
went
on
as
if
the
welfare
of
the
establishment
was
bound
up
with
the
purchase
of
this
beast
the
circassians
took
the
liberty
of
jumping
upon
his
back
their
eyes
shone
wildly
they
chatted
rapidly
in
their
incomprehensible
dialect
showed
their
white
teeth
dilating
the
nostrils
of
their
hooked
noses
there
were
some
russians
who
paid
the
most
lively
attention
to
their
discussion
and
seemed
ready
to
jump
down
their
throats
they
did
not
understand
a
word
but
it
was
plain
they
did
what
they
could
to
gather
from
the
expression
of
the
eyes
of
the
fellows
whether
the
horse
was
good
or
not
but
what
could
it
matter
to
a
convict
especially
to
some
of
them
who
were
creatures
altogether
down
and
done
for
who
never
ventured
to
utter
a
single
word
to
the
others
what
it
matter
to
such
as
these
whether
one
horse
or
another
was
bought
yet
it
seemed
as
if
it
did
the
circassians
appeared
to
be
most
relied
on
for
their
opinion
and
besides
these
a
foremost
place
in
the
discussion
was
given
to
the
tsigans
and
those
who
had
formerly
been
there
was
a
regular
sort
of
duel
between
two
convicts
the
tsigan
koulikoff
who
had
been
a
and
stealer
and
another
who
had
been
a
professional
veterinary
a
tricky
siberian
peasant
who
had
been
at
the
establishment
and
at
hard
labour
for
some
time
and
who
had
succeeded
in
getting
all
koulikoff
practice
in
the
town
i
ought
to
mention
that
the
veterinary
practitioners
at
the
prison
though
without
diploma
were
very
much
sought
after
and
that
not
only
the
townspeople
and
tradespeople
but
high
officials
in
the
city
took
their
advice
when
their
horses
fell
ill
rather
than
that
of
several
regularly
diplomatised
veterinaries
who
were
at
the
place
till
jolkin
came
the
siberian
peasant
koulikoff
had
had
plenty
of
clients
from
whom
he
had
had
fees
in
good
hard
cash
he
was
looked
on
as
quite
at
the
head
of
his
business
he
was
a
tsigan
all
over
in
his
doings
liar
and
cheat
and
not
at
all
the
master
of
his
art
he
boasted
of
being
the
income
he
made
had
raised
him
to
be
a
sort
of
aristocrat
among
our
convicts
he
was
listened
to
and
obeyed
but
he
spoke
little
and
expressed
an
opinion
only
in
great
emergencies
he
blew
his
own
trumpet
loudly
but
he
really
was
a
fellow
of
great
energy
he
was
of
ripe
age
and
of
quite
marked
intelligence
when
he
spoke
to
us
of
the
nobility
he
did
so
with
exquisite
politeness
and
perfect
dignity
i
am
sure
that
if
he
had
been
suitably
dressed
and
introduced
into
a
club
at
the
capital
with
the
title
of
count
he
would
have
lived
up
to
it
played
whist
talked
to
admiration
like
a
man
used
to
command
and
one
who
knew
when
to
hold
his
tongue
i
am
sure
that
the
whole
evening
would
have
passed
without
any
one
guessing
that
the
count
was
nothing
but
a
vagabond
he
had
very
probably
had
a
very
large
and
varied
experience
in
life
as
to
his
past
it
was
quite
unknown
to
us
they
kept
him
among
the
convicts
who
formed
a
special
section
reserved
from
the
others
but
no
sooner
had
jolkin
come
he
was
a
simple
peasant
one
of
the
old
believers
but
just
as
tricky
as
it
was
possible
for
a
moujik
to
be
the
veterinary
glory
of
koulikoff
paled
sensibly
in
less
than
two
months
the
siberian
had
got
from
him
all
his
town
practice
for
he
cured
in
a
very
short
time
horses
koulikoff
had
declared
incurable
and
which
had
been
given
up
by
the
regular
veterinaries
this
peasant
had
been
condemned
and
sent
to
hard
labour
for
coining
it
is
an
odd
thing
he
should
ever
have
been
tempted
to
go
into
that
line
of
business
he
told
us
all
about
it
himself
and
joked
about
their
wanting
three
coins
of
genuine
gold
to
make
one
false
koulikoff
was
not
a
little
put
out
at
this
peasant
success
while
his
own
glory
so
rapidly
declined
there
was
he
who
had
had
a
mistress
in
the
suburbs
who
used
to
wear
a
plush
jacket
and
and
here
he
was
now
obliged
to
turn
so
everybody
looked
out
for
a
regular
row
when
the
new
horse
was
bought
the
thing
was
very
interesting
each
of
them
had
his
partisans
the
more
eager
among
them
got
to
angry
words
about
it
on
the
spot
the
cunning
face
of
jolkin
was
all
wrinkled
into
a
sarcastic
smile
but
it
turned
out
quite
differently
from
what
was
expected
koulikoff
had
not
the
least
desire
for
argument
or
dispute
he
managed
cunningly
without
that
at
first
he
gave
way
on
every
point
and
listened
deferentially
to
his
rival
criticisms
then
he
caught
him
up
sharply
on
some
remark
or
other
and
pointed
out
to
him
modestly
but
firmly
that
he
was
all
wrong
in
a
word
jolkin
was
utterly
discomfited
in
a
surprisingly
clever
way
so
koulikoff
side
was
quite
well
pleased
i
say
boys
it
no
use
talking
you
ca
trip
up
he
knows
what
he
is
about
said
some
jolkin
knows
more
about
the
matter
than
he
does
said
others
not
offensively
however
both
sides
were
ready
to
make
concessions
then
he
got
a
lighter
hand
besides
having
more
in
his
head
i
tell
you
that
when
it
comes
to
stock
horses
or
anything
else
koulikoff
need
duck
under
to
anybody
nor
need
jolkin
i
tell
you
there
nobody
like
koulikoff
the
new
horse
was
selected
and
bought
it
was
a
capital
gelding
young
vigorous
and
handsome
an
irreproachable
beast
altogether
the
bargaining
began
the
owner
asked
thirty
roubles
the
convicts
give
more
than
the
higgling
went
on
long
and
hotly
at
length
the
convicts
began
laughing
does
the
money
come
out
of
your
own
purse
said
some
what
the
good
of
all
this
do
you
want
to
save
for
the
government
cashbox
cried
others
but
it
money
that
belongs
to
us
all
pals
said
one
us
all
it
plain
enough
that
you
need
trouble
to
grow
idiots
they
come
up
of
themselves
without
it
at
last
the
business
was
settled
at
roubles
the
major
was
informed
the
purchase
sanctioned
bread
and
salt
were
brought
at
once
and
the
new
boarder
led
in
triumph
into
the
jail
there
was
not
one
of
the
convicts
i
think
that
did
not
pat
his
neck
or
caress
his
head
the
day
we
got
him
he
was
at
once
put
to
fetching
water
all
the
convicts
gazed
on
him
curiously
as
he
pulled
at
his
barrel
our
waterman
the
convict
roman
kept
his
eyes
on
the
beast
with
a
stupid
sort
of
satisfaction
he
was
formerly
a
peasant
about
fifty
years
of
age
serious
and
silent
like
all
the
russian
coachmen
whose
behaviour
would
really
seem
to
acquire
some
extra
gravity
by
reason
of
their
being
always
with
horses
roman
was
a
quiet
creature
affable
all
round
said
little
took
snuff
from
a
box
he
had
taken
care
of
the
horses
at
the
jail
for
some
time
before
that
the
one
just
bought
was
the
third
given
into
his
charge
since
he
came
to
the
place
the
coachman
office
fell
as
a
matter
of
course
to
roman
nobody
would
have
dreamed
of
contesting
his
right
to
it
when
the
bay
horse
dropped
and
died
nobody
dreamed
of
accusing
roman
of
imprudence
not
even
the
major
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
was
all
as
to
roman
he
knew
his
business
that
bay
horse
had
become
the
pet
of
the
jail
at
once
the
convicts
were
not
particularly
tender
fellows
but
they
could
not
help
coming
to
pet
him
often
sometimes
when
roman
returning
from
the
river
shut
the
great
gate
which
the
had
opened
gniedko
would
stand
quite
still
waiting
for
his
driver
and
turning
to
him
as
for
orders
get
along
you
know
the
way
roman
would
cry
to
him
then
gniedko
would
go
off
peaceably
to
the
kitchen
and
stop
there
and
the
cooks
and
other
servants
of
the
place
would
fill
their
buckets
with
water
which
gniedko
seemed
to
know
all
about
gniedko
you
a
trump
he
brought
his
himself
he
a
delight
to
see
they
would
cry
to
him
that
true
he
only
a
beast
but
he
knows
all
that
said
to
him
no
end
of
a
horse
is
our
gniedko
then
the
horse
shook
his
head
and
snorted
just
as
if
he
really
understood
all
about
his
being
praised
then
some
one
would
bring
him
bread
and
salt
and
when
he
had
finished
with
them
he
would
shake
his
head
again
as
if
to
say
i
know
you
i
know
you
i
a
good
horse
and
you
a
good
fellow
i
was
quite
fond
of
regaling
gniedko
with
bread
it
was
quite
a
pleasure
to
me
to
look
at
his
nice
mouth
and
to
feel
his
warm
moist
lips
licking
up
the
crumbs
from
the
palm
of
my
hand
our
convicts
were
fond
of
live
things
and
if
they
had
been
allowed
would
have
filled
the
barracks
with
birds
and
domestic
animals
what
could
possibly
have
been
better
than
attending
to
such
creatures
for
raising
and
softening
the
wild
temper
of
the
prisoners
but
it
was
not
permitted
it
was
not
in
the
regulations
and
truth
to
say
there
was
no
room
there
for
many
creatures
however
in
my
time
some
animals
had
established
themselves
in
the
jail
besides
gniedko
we
had
some
dogs
geese
a
vaska
and
an
eagle
which
remained
only
a
short
time
i
think
i
have
said
before
that
dog
was
called
bull
and
that
he
and
i
had
struck
up
a
friendship
but
as
the
lower
orders
regard
dogs
as
impure
animals
undeserving
of
attention
nobody
minded
him
he
lived
in
the
jail
itself
slept
in
the
ate
the
leavings
of
the
kitchen
and
had
no
hold
whatever
on
the
sympathy
of
the
convicts
all
of
whom
he
knew
however
and
regarded
as
masters
and
owners
when
the
men
assigned
to
work
came
back
to
the
jail
at
the
cry
of
corporal
he
used
to
run
to
the
great
gate
and
gaily
welcome
the
gang
wagging
his
tail
and
looking
into
every
man
eyes
as
though
he
expected
a
caress
but
for
several
years
his
little
ways
were
as
useless
as
they
were
engaging
nobody
but
myself
did
caress
him
so
i
was
the
one
he
preferred
to
all
others
somehow
i
do
know
in
what
way
we
got
another
dog
snow
he
was
called
as
to
the
third
koultiapka
i
brought
him
myself
to
the
place
when
he
was
but
a
pup
our
snow
was
a
strange
creature
a
telega
had
gone
over
him
and
driven
in
his
spine
so
that
it
made
a
curve
inside
him
when
you
saw
him
running
at
a
distance
he
looked
like
born
with
a
ligament
he
was
very
mangy
too
with
bleary
eyes
and
his
tail
was
hairless
and
always
hanging
between
his
legs
victim
of
as
he
was
he
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
be
always
as
impassive
as
possible
so
he
never
barked
at
anybody
for
he
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
getting
into
some
fresh
trouble
he
was
nearly
always
lurking
at
the
back
of
the
buildings
and
if
anybody
came
near
he
rolled
on
his
back
at
once
as
though
he
meant
to
say
do
what
you
like
with
me
i
not
the
least
idea
of
resisting
you
and
every
convict
when
the
dog
upset
himself
like
that
would
give
him
a
passing
obligatory
kick
with
ouh
the
dirty
brute
but
snow
dared
not
so
much
as
give
a
groan
and
if
he
was
too
much
hurt
would
only
utter
a
little
dull
strangled
yelp
he
threw
himself
down
just
the
same
way
before
bull
or
any
other
dog
when
he
came
to
try
his
luck
at
the
kitchen
and
he
would
stretch
himself
out
flat
if
a
mastiff
or
any
other
big
dog
came
barking
at
him
dogs
like
submission
and
humility
in
other
dogs
so
the
angry
brute
quieted
down
at
once
and
stopped
short
reflectively
before
the
poor
humble
beast
and
then
sniffed
him
curiously
all
over
i
wonder
what
poor
snow
trembling
with
fright
used
to
think
at
such
moments
is
this
brigand
of
a
fellow
going
to
bite
me
no
doubt
something
like
that
when
he
had
sniffed
enough
at
him
the
big
brute
left
him
at
once
having
probably
discovered
nothing
in
particular
snow
used
then
to
jump
to
his
feet
and
join
a
lot
of
fellows
like
him
who
were
running
down
some
yutchka
or
other
snow
knew
quite
well
that
no
yutchka
would
ever
condescend
to
the
like
of
him
that
she
was
too
proud
for
that
but
it
was
some
consolation
to
him
in
his
troubles
to
limp
after
her
as
to
decent
behaviour
he
had
but
a
very
vague
notion
of
any
such
thing
being
totally
without
any
hope
in
his
future
his
highest
aim
was
to
get
a
bellyful
of
victuals
and
he
was
cynical
enough
in
showing
that
it
was
so
once
i
tried
to
caress
him
this
was
such
an
unexpected
and
new
thing
to
him
that
he
plumped
down
on
the
ground
quite
helplessly
and
quivered
and
whined
in
his
delight
as
i
was
really
sorry
for
him
i
used
to
caress
him
often
so
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
began
to
whine
in
a
plaintive
tearful
way
he
came
to
his
end
at
the
back
of
the
jail
in
the
ditch
some
dogs
tore
him
to
pieces
koultiapka
was
quite
a
different
style
of
dog
i
do
know
why
i
brought
him
in
from
one
of
the
workshops
where
he
was
just
born
but
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
feed
him
and
see
him
grow
big
bull
took
koultiapka
under
his
protection
and
slept
with
him
when
the
young
dog
began
to
grow
up
bull
was
remarkably
complaisant
with
him
he
allowed
the
pup
to
bite
his
ears
and
pull
his
skin
with
his
teeth
he
played
with
him
as
mature
dogs
are
in
the
habit
of
doing
with
the
youngsters
it
was
a
strange
thing
but
koultiapka
never
grew
in
height
at
all
only
in
length
and
breadth
his
hide
was
fluffy
and
one
of
his
ears
hung
down
while
the
other
was
always
cocked
up
he
was
like
all
young
dogs
ardent
and
enthusiastic
yelping
with
pleasure
when
he
saw
his
master
and
jumping
up
to
lick
his
face
precisely
as
if
he
said
as
long
as
he
sees
how
delighted
i
am
i
do
care
let
etiquette
go
to
the
devil
wherever
i
was
at
my
call
koultiapka
out
he
came
from
some
corner
dashing
towards
me
with
noisy
satisfaction
making
a
ball
of
himself
and
rolling
over
and
over
i
was
exceedingly
fond
of
the
little
wretch
and
i
used
to
fancy
that
destiny
had
reserved
for
him
nothing
but
joy
and
pleasure
in
this
world
of
ours
but
one
fine
day
the
convict
neustroief
who
made
women
shoes
and
prepared
skins
cast
his
eye
on
him
something
had
evidently
struck
him
for
he
called
koultiapka
felt
his
skin
and
turned
him
over
on
the
ground
in
a
friendly
way
the
unsuspicious
dog
barked
with
pleasure
but
next
day
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
i
hunted
for
him
for
some
time
but
in
vain
at
last
after
two
weeks
all
was
explained
koultiapka
natural
cloak
had
been
too
much
for
neustroief
who
had
flayed
him
to
make
up
with
the
skin
some
boots
of
velvet
ordered
by
the
young
wife
of
some
official
he
showed
them
me
when
they
were
done
their
inside
lining
was
magnificent
all
koultiapka
poor
fellow
a
good
many
convicts
worked
at
tanning
and
often
brought
with
them
to
the
jail
dogs
with
a
nice
skin
which
soon
were
seen
no
more
they
stole
them
or
bought
them
i
remember
one
day
i
saw
a
couple
of
convicts
behind
the
kitchens
laying
their
heads
together
one
of
them
held
in
a
leash
a
very
fine
black
dog
of
particularly
good
breed
a
scamp
of
a
footman
had
stolen
it
from
his
master
and
sold
it
to
our
shoemakers
for
thirty
kopecks
they
were
going
to
hang
it
that
was
their
way
of
disposing
of
them
then
they
took
the
skin
off
and
threw
the
body
into
a
ditch
used
for
which
was
in
the
most
distant
corner
of
the
court
and
which
stank
most
horribly
during
the
summer
heats
for
it
was
rarely
seen
to
i
think
the
poor
beast
understood
the
fate
in
store
for
him
it
looked
at
us
one
after
another
in
a
distressed
scrutinising
way
at
intervals
it
gave
a
timid
little
wag
with
its
bushy
tail
between
its
legs
as
though
trying
to
reach
our
hearts
by
showing
us
every
confidence
i
hastened
away
from
the
convicts
who
finished
their
vile
work
without
hindrance
as
to
the
geese
of
the
establishment
they
had
established
themselves
there
quite
fortuitously
who
took
care
of
them
to
whom
did
they
belong
i
really
do
know
but
they
were
a
huge
delight
to
our
convicts
and
acquired
a
certain
fame
throughout
the
town
they
had
been
hatched
in
the
convict
establishment
somewhere
and
their
was
the
kitchen
whence
they
emerged
in
gangs
of
their
own
when
the
gangs
of
convicts
went
out
to
their
work
but
as
soon
as
the
drum
beat
and
the
prisoners
massed
themselves
at
the
great
gate
out
ran
the
geese
after
them
cackling
and
flapping
their
wings
then
they
jumped
one
after
the
other
over
the
elevated
threshold
of
the
gateway
while
the
convicts
were
at
their
work
the
geese
pecked
about
at
a
little
distance
from
them
as
soon
as
they
had
done
and
set
out
for
the
jail
again
the
geese
joined
the
procession
and
people
who
passed
by
would
cry
out
i
say
there
are
the
prisoners
with
their
friends
the
geese
how
did
you
teach
them
to
follow
you
some
one
would
ask
here
some
money
for
your
geese
another
said
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
in
spite
of
their
devotion
to
the
convicts
they
had
their
necks
twisted
to
make
a
feast
at
the
end
of
the
lent
of
some
year
i
forget
which
nobody
would
ever
have
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
our
goat
vaska
unless
something
particular
had
happened
as
it
did
i
do
know
how
it
got
into
our
prison
or
who
had
brought
it
it
was
a
white
kid
and
very
pretty
after
some
days
it
had
won
all
hearts
it
was
diverting
and
winning
as
some
excuse
was
needed
for
keeping
it
in
the
jail
it
was
given
out
that
it
was
quite
necessary
to
have
a
goat
in
the
stables
but
he
did
live
there
but
in
the
kitchen
principally
and
after
a
while
he
roamed
about
all
over
the
place
the
creature
was
full
of
grace
and
as
playful
as
could
be
jumped
on
the
tables
wrestled
with
the
convicts
came
when
it
was
called
and
was
always
full
of
spirits
and
fun
one
evening
the
lesghian
babaï
who
was
seated
on
the
stone
steps
at
the
doors
of
the
barracks
among
a
crowd
of
other
convicts
took
it
into
his
head
to
have
a
wrestling
bout
with
vaska
whose
horns
were
pretty
long
they
butted
their
foreheads
against
one
another
that
was
the
way
the
convicts
amused
themselves
with
him
when
all
of
a
sudden
vaska
jumped
on
the
highest
step
lifted
himself
up
on
his
hind
legs
drew
his
to
him
and
managed
to
strike
the
lesghian
on
the
back
of
the
neck
with
all
his
might
and
with
such
effect
that
babaï
went
headlong
down
the
steps
to
the
great
delight
of
all
who
were
by
as
well
as
of
babaï
himself
in
a
word
we
all
adored
our
vaska
when
he
attained
the
age
of
puberty
a
general
and
serious
consultation
was
held
as
the
result
of
which
he
was
subjected
to
an
operation
which
one
of
the
prison
veterinaries
executed
in
a
masterly
manner
well
said
the
prisoners
he
wo
have
any
about
him
that
one
comfort
vaska
then
began
to
lay
on
fat
in
the
most
surprising
way
i
must
say
that
we
fed
him
quite
unconscionably
he
became
a
most
beautiful
fellow
with
magnificent
horns
corpulent
beyond
anything
sometimes
as
he
walked
he
rolled
over
on
the
ground
heavily
out
of
sheer
fatness
he
went
with
us
out
to
work
too
which
was
very
diverting
to
the
convicts
and
all
others
who
saw
and
everybody
got
to
know
vaska
the
jailbird
when
they
worked
at
the
river
bank
the
prisoners
used
to
cut
willow
branches
and
other
foliage
and
gather
flowers
in
the
ditches
to
ornament
vaska
they
used
to
twine
the
branches
and
flowers
round
his
horns
and
decorate
his
body
with
garlands
vaska
then
came
back
at
the
head
of
the
gang
in
a
splendid
state
of
ornamentation
and
we
all
came
after
in
high
pride
at
seeing
him
such
a
beauty
this
love
for
our
goat
went
so
far
that
prisoners
raised
the
question
not
a
very
wise
one
whether
vaska
ought
not
to
have
his
horns
gilded
it
was
a
vain
idea
nothing
came
of
it
i
asked
akim
akimitch
the
best
gilder
in
the
jail
whether
you
really
could
gild
a
goat
horns
he
examined
vaska
quite
closely
thought
a
bit
and
then
said
that
it
could
be
done
but
that
it
would
not
last
and
would
be
quite
useless
so
nothing
came
of
it
vaska
would
have
lived
for
many
years
more
and
no
doubt
have
died
of
asthma
at
last
if
one
day
as
he
returned
from
work
at
the
head
of
the
convicts
his
path
had
not
been
crossed
by
the
major
who
was
seated
in
his
carriage
vaska
was
in
particularly
gorgeous
array
halt
yelled
the
major
whose
goat
is
that
they
told
him
what
a
goat
in
the
prison
and
that
without
my
leave
the
received
orders
to
kill
the
goat
without
a
delay
flay
him
and
sell
his
skin
and
put
the
proceeds
to
the
prisoners
account
as
to
the
meat
he
ordered
it
to
be
cooked
with
the
convicts
cabbage
soup
the
occurrence
was
much
discussed
the
goat
was
much
mourned
but
nobody
dared
to
disobey
the
major
vaska
was
put
to
death
close
to
the
ditch
i
spoke
of
just
now
one
of
the
convicts
bought
the
carcase
paying
a
rouble
and
fifty
kopecks
with
this
money
white
bread
was
bought
for
everybody
the
man
who
had
bought
the
goat
sold
him
at
retail
in
a
roasted
state
the
meat
was
delicious
we
had
also
during
some
time
in
our
prison
a
steppe
eagle
a
quite
small
species
a
convict
brought
it
in
wounded
everybody
came
flocking
around
it
it
could
not
fly
its
right
wing
being
quite
powerless
one
of
its
legs
was
badly
hurt
it
gazed
on
the
curious
crowd
wrathfully
and
opened
its
crooked
beak
as
if
prepared
to
sell
its
life
dearly
when
we
had
looked
at
him
long
enough
and
the
crowd
dispersed
the
lamed
bird
went
off
hopping
on
one
paw
and
flapping
his
wing
and
hid
himself
in
the
most
distant
part
of
the
place
he
could
find
there
he
huddled
himself
in
a
corner
against
the
palings
during
the
three
months
that
he
remained
in
our
he
never
came
out
of
his
corner
at
first
we
went
to
look
at
him
pretty
often
and
sometimes
they
set
bull
at
him
who
threw
himself
forward
with
fury
but
was
frightened
to
go
too
near
which
mightily
amused
the
convicts
a
wild
chap
that
he
wo
stand
any
nonsense
but
bull
after
a
while
got
over
his
fright
and
began
to
worry
him
when
he
was
roused
to
it
the
dog
would
catch
hold
of
the
bird
bad
wing
and
the
creature
defended
itself
with
beak
and
claws
and
then
got
up
closer
into
his
corner
with
a
proud
savage
sort
of
demeanour
like
a
wounded
king
fixing
his
eyes
steadily
on
the
fellows
looking
at
his
misery
they
tired
of
the
sport
after
a
while
and
the
eagle
seemed
quite
forgotten
but
there
was
some
one
who
every
day
put
close
to
him
a
bit
of
fresh
meat
and
a
vessel
with
some
water
at
first
and
for
several
days
the
eagle
would
eat
nothing
at
last
he
made
up
his
mind
to
take
what
was
left
for
him
but
he
never
could
be
got
to
take
anything
from
the
hand
or
in
public
sometimes
i
succeeded
in
watching
his
proceedings
at
some
distance
when
he
saw
nobody
and
thought
he
was
alone
he
ventured
upon
leaving
his
corner
and
limping
along
the
palisade
for
a
dozen
steps
or
so
then
went
back
and
so
forwards
and
backwards
precisely
as
if
he
were
taking
exercise
for
his
health
under
medical
orders
as
soon
as
ever
he
caught
sight
of
me
he
made
for
his
corner
as
quickly
as
he
possibly
could
limping
and
hopping
then
he
threw
his
head
back
opened
his
mouth
ruffled
himself
and
seemed
to
make
ready
for
fight
in
vain
i
tried
to
caress
him
he
bit
and
struggled
as
soon
as
he
was
touched
not
once
did
he
take
the
meat
i
offered
him
and
all
the
time
i
remained
by
him
he
kept
his
wicked
piercing
eye
upon
me
lonely
and
revengeful
he
waited
for
death
defying
refusing
to
be
reconciled
with
everything
and
everybody
at
last
the
convicts
remembered
him
after
two
months
of
complete
forgetfulness
and
then
they
showed
a
sympathy
i
did
not
expect
of
them
it
was
unanimously
agreed
to
carry
him
out
let
him
die
but
let
him
die
in
freedom
said
the
prisoners
sure
enough
a
free
and
independent
bird
like
that
will
never
get
used
to
the
prison
added
others
he
not
like
us
said
some
one
oh
well
he
a
bird
and
we
human
beings
the
eagle
pals
is
the
king
of
the
woods
began
skouratof
but
that
day
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him
one
afternoon
when
the
drum
beat
for
beginning
work
they
took
the
eagle
tied
his
beak
for
he
struck
a
desperate
attitude
and
took
him
out
of
the
prison
on
to
the
ramparts
the
twelve
convicts
of
the
gang
were
extremely
anxious
to
know
where
he
would
go
to
it
was
a
strange
thing
they
all
seemed
as
happy
as
though
they
had
themselves
got
their
freedom
oh
the
wretched
brute
one
wants
to
do
him
a
kindness
and
he
tears
your
hand
for
you
by
way
of
thanks
said
the
man
who
held
him
looking
almost
lovingly
at
the
spiteful
bird
let
him
fly
off
mikitka
it
does
suit
being
a
prisoner
give
him
his
freedom
his
jolly
freedom
they
threw
him
from
the
ramparts
on
to
the
steppe
it
was
just
at
the
end
of
autumn
a
gray
cold
day
the
wind
whistled
on
the
bare
steppe
and
went
groaning
through
the
yellow
grass
the
eagle
made
off
directly
flapping
his
wounded
wing
as
if
in
a
hurry
to
quit
us
and
get
himself
a
shelter
from
our
piercing
eyes
the
convicts
watched
him
intently
as
he
went
along
with
his
head
just
above
the
grass
do
you
see
him
hey
said
one
very
pensively
he
does
look
round
said
another
he
has
looked
behind
once
did
you
happen
to
fancy
he
come
back
to
thank
us
said
a
third
sure
enough
he
free
he
feels
it
it
yes
freedom
you
wo
see
him
any
more
pals
what
are
you
about
sticking
there
march
march
cried
the
escort
and
all
went
slowly
to
their
work
chapter
vii
grievances
at
the
outset
of
this
chapter
the
editor
of
the
recollections
of
the
late
alexander
petrovitch
goriantchikoff
thinks
it
his
duty
to
communicate
what
follows
to
his
readers
in
the
first
chapter
of
the
of
the
house
of
the
dead
something
was
said
about
a
parricide
of
noble
birth
who
was
put
forward
as
an
instance
of
the
insensibility
with
which
the
convicts
speak
of
the
crimes
they
have
committed
it
was
also
stated
that
he
refused
altogether
to
confess
to
the
authorities
and
the
court
but
that
thanks
to
the
statements
of
persons
who
knew
all
the
details
of
his
case
and
history
his
guilt
was
put
beyond
all
doubt
these
persons
had
informed
the
author
of
the
that
the
criminal
had
been
of
dissolute
life
and
overwhelmed
with
debts
and
that
he
had
murdered
his
father
to
come
into
the
property
besides
the
whole
town
where
this
parricide
was
imprisoned
told
his
story
in
precisely
the
same
way
a
fact
of
which
the
editor
of
these
has
fully
satisfied
himself
it
was
further
stated
that
this
murderer
even
when
in
the
jail
was
of
quite
a
joyous
and
cheerful
frame
of
mind
a
sort
of
inconsiderate
person
although
intelligent
and
that
the
author
of
the
had
never
observed
any
particular
signs
of
cruelty
about
him
to
which
he
added
i
for
my
part
never
could
bring
myself
to
believe
him
guilty
some
time
ago
the
editor
of
the
of
the
house
of
the
dead
had
intelligence
from
siberia
of
the
discovery
of
the
innocence
of
this
and
that
he
had
undergone
ten
years
of
the
imprisonment
with
hard
labour
for
nothing
this
was
recognised
and
avowed
by
the
authorities
the
real
criminals
had
been
discovered
and
had
confessed
and
the
unfortunate
man
in
question
set
at
liberty
all
this
stands
upon
unimpeachable
and
authoritative
grounds
to
say
more
would
be
useless
the
tragical
facts
speak
too
clearly
for
themselves
all
words
are
weak
in
such
a
case
where
a
life
has
been
ruined
by
such
an
accusation
such
mistakes
as
these
are
among
the
dreadful
possibilities
of
life
and
such
possibilities
impart
a
keener
and
more
vivid
interest
to
the
recollections
of
the
house
of
the
dead
which
dreadful
place
we
see
may
contain
innocent
as
well
as
guilty
men
to
continue
i
have
said
that
i
became
at
last
in
some
sense
accustomed
if
not
reconciled
to
the
conditions
of
convict
life
but
it
was
a
long
and
dreadful
time
before
i
was
it
took
me
nearly
a
year
to
get
used
to
the
prison
and
i
shall
always
regard
this
year
as
the
most
dreadful
of
my
life
it
is
graven
deep
in
my
memory
down
to
the
very
least
details
i
think
that
i
could
minutely
recall
the
events
and
feelings
of
each
successive
hour
in
it
i
have
said
that
the
other
prisoners
too
found
it
as
difficult
as
i
did
to
get
used
to
the
life
they
had
to
lead
during
the
whole
of
this
first
year
i
used
to
ask
myself
whether
they
were
really
as
calm
as
they
seemed
to
be
questions
of
this
kind
pressed
themselves
upon
me
as
i
have
mentioned
before
all
the
convicts
felt
themselves
in
an
alien
element
to
which
they
could
not
reconcile
themselves
the
sense
of
home
was
an
impossibility
they
felt
as
if
they
were
staying
as
a
stage
upon
a
journey
in
an
evil
sort
of
inn
these
men
exiles
for
and
from
life
seemed
either
in
a
perpetual
smouldering
agitation
or
else
in
deep
depression
but
there
was
not
one
who
had
not
his
ordinary
ideas
of
one
thing
or
another
this
restlessness
which
if
it
did
not
come
to
the
surface
was
still
unmistakable
those
vague
hopes
of
the
poor
creatures
which
existed
in
spite
of
themselves
hopes
so
that
they
were
more
like
the
promptings
of
incipient
insanity
than
aught
else
all
this
stamped
the
place
with
a
character
an
originality
peculiarly
its
own
one
could
not
but
feel
when
one
went
there
that
there
was
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
in
the
whole
world
there
everybody
went
about
in
a
sort
of
waking
dream
nor
was
there
anything
to
relieve
or
qualify
the
impressions
the
place
made
on
the
system
of
every
man
so
that
all
seemed
to
suffer
from
a
sort
of
hyperæsthetic
neurosis
and
this
dreaming
of
impossibilities
gave
to
the
majority
of
the
convicts
a
sombre
and
morose
aspect
for
which
the
word
morbid
is
not
strong
enough
nearly
all
were
taciturn
and
irascible
preferring
to
keep
to
themselves
the
hopes
they
secretly
and
vainly
cherished
the
result
was
that
anything
like
ingenuousness
or
frank
statement
was
the
object
of
general
contempt
precisely
because
these
wild
hopings
were
impossible
and
despite
themselves
were
felt
to
be
so
confessed
to
their
more
lucid
selves
to
be
so
they
kept
them
jealously
concealed
in
the
most
secret
recesses
of
their
souls
while
to
renounce
them
was
beyond
their
powers
of
it
may
be
they
were
ashamed
of
their
imagination
god
knows
the
russian
character
is
in
its
normal
conditions
so
positive
and
sober
in
its
way
of
looking
at
life
so
pitiless
in
criticism
of
its
own
weaknesses
perhaps
it
was
this
inward
misery
of
which
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
impatience
and
intolerance
the
convicts
showed
among
themselves
and
of
the
cruel
biting
things
they
said
to
each
other
if
one
of
them
more
naïve
or
impartial
than
the
rest
put
into
words
what
every
one
of
them
had
in
his
mind
painted
his
castles
in
the
air
told
his
dreams
of
liberty
or
plans
of
escape
they
shut
him
up
with
brutal
promptitude
and
made
the
poor
fellow
life
a
burden
to
him
with
their
sarcasms
and
jests
and
i
think
those
did
it
most
unscrupulously
who
had
perhaps
themselves
gone
furthest
in
cherishing
futile
hopes
and
indulging
in
senseless
expectations
i
have
said
more
than
once
that
those
among
them
who
were
marked
by
simplicity
and
candour
were
looked
on
rather
as
being
stupid
and
idiotic
there
was
nothing
but
contempt
for
them
the
convicts
were
so
soured
and
in
the
wrong
sense
sensitive
that
they
positively
hated
anything
like
amiability
or
unselfishness
i
should
be
disposed
to
classify
them
all
broadly
as
either
good
or
bad
men
morose
or
cheerful
putting
by
themselves
as
a
sort
of
separate
creatures
the
ingenious
fellows
who
could
not
hold
their
tongues
but
the
were
in
far
the
greatest
majority
some
of
these
were
talkative
but
these
were
usually
of
slanderous
and
envious
disposition
always
poking
their
noses
into
other
business
though
they
took
good
care
not
to
let
anybody
have
a
glimpse
of
the
secret
thoughts
of
their
souls
that
would
have
been
against
the
fashions
and
conventions
of
this
strange
little
world
as
to
the
fellows
who
were
really
good
very
few
indeed
were
they
these
were
always
very
quiet
and
peaceable
and
buried
their
hopes
if
they
had
any
in
strict
silence
but
more
of
real
faith
went
with
their
hopes
than
was
the
case
with
the
among
the
convicts
stay
there
was
one
category
further
among
our
convicts
which
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
the
men
who
had
lost
all
hope
who
were
despairing
and
desperate
like
the
old
man
of
starodoub
but
these
were
very
few
indeed
the
old
man
of
starodoub
this
was
a
very
subdued
quiet
old
man
but
there
were
some
indications
of
what
went
on
in
him
which
he
could
not
help
giving
and
from
which
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
his
inward
life
was
one
of
intolerable
horror
still
he
had
to
fall
back
upon
for
help
and
consolation
prayer
and
the
notion
that
he
was
a
martyr
the
convict
who
was
always
reading
the
bible
of
whom
i
spoke
earlier
the
one
that
went
mad
and
threw
himself
brick
in
hand
upon
the
major
was
also
probably
one
of
those
whom
hope
had
altogether
abandoned
and
as
it
is
perfectly
impossible
to
go
on
living
without
hope
of
some
sort
he
threw
away
his
life
as
a
sort
of
voluntary
sacrifice
he
declared
that
he
attacked
the
major
though
he
had
no
grievance
in
particular
all
he
wanted
was
to
have
some
torments
inflicted
on
himself
now
what
sort
of
psychological
operation
had
been
going
on
in
man
soul
no
man
lives
can
live
without
having
object
in
view
and
making
efforts
to
attain
that
object
but
when
object
there
is
none
and
hope
is
entirely
fled
anguish
often
turns
a
man
into
a
monster
the
object
all
had
in
view
was
liberty
and
getting
out
of
our
place
of
confinement
and
hard
labour
so
i
try
to
place
our
convicts
in
classes
and
categories
but
it
can
not
well
be
done
reality
is
a
thing
of
infinite
diversity
and
defies
the
most
ingenious
deductions
and
definitions
of
abstract
thought
nay
abhors
the
clear
and
precise
classifications
we
so
delight
in
reality
tends
to
infinite
subdivision
of
things
and
truth
is
a
matter
of
infinite
shadings
and
differentiations
every
one
of
us
who
were
there
had
his
own
peculiar
interior
strictly
personal
life
which
lay
altogether
outside
of
the
world
of
regulations
and
our
official
superintendence
but
as
i
have
said
before
i
could
not
penetrate
the
depths
of
this
interior
life
in
the
early
part
of
my
prison
career
for
everything
that
met
my
eyes
or
challenged
my
attention
in
any
way
filled
me
with
a
sadness
for
which
there
are
no
words
sometimes
i
felt
nothing
short
of
hatred
for
poor
creatures
whose
martyrdom
was
at
least
as
great
as
mine
in
those
first
days
i
envied
them
because
they
were
among
persons
of
their
own
sort
and
understood
one
another
so
i
thought
but
the
truth
was
that
their
enforced
companionship
the
comradeship
where
the
word
of
command
went
with
the
whip
or
the
rod
was
as
much
an
object
of
aversion
to
them
as
it
was
to
myself
and
every
one
of
them
tried
to
keep
himself
as
much
to
himself
as
possible
this
envious
hatred
of
them
which
came
to
me
in
moments
of
irritation
was
not
without
its
reasonable
cause
for
those
who
tell
you
so
confidently
that
a
cultivated
man
of
the
higher
class
does
not
suffer
as
a
mere
peasant
does
are
utterly
in
the
wrong
that
is
a
thing
i
have
often
heard
said
and
read
too
in
the
abstract
the
notion
seems
correct
and
it
is
founded
in
generous
sentiment
for
all
convicts
are
human
beings
alike
but
in
reality
it
is
different
in
the
real
living
facts
of
the
problem
there
come
in
a
quantity
of
practical
complications
and
only
experience
can
pronounce
upon
these
experience
which
i
have
had
i
do
not
mean
to
lay
it
down
peremptorily
that
the
nobleman
and
the
man
of
culture
feel
more
acutely
sensitively
deeply
because
of
their
more
highly
developed
conditions
of
being
on
the
other
hand
it
is
impossible
to
bring
all
souls
to
one
common
level
or
standard
neither
the
grade
of
education
nor
any
other
thing
furnishes
a
standard
according
to
which
punishment
can
be
meted
out
it
is
a
great
satisfaction
to
me
to
be
able
to
say
that
among
these
dreadful
sufferers
in
a
state
of
things
so
barbarous
and
abject
i
found
abundant
proof
that
the
elements
of
moral
development
were
not
wanting
in
our
convict
establishment
there
were
men
whom
i
was
familiar
with
for
several
years
and
whom
i
looked
upon
as
wild
beasts
and
abhorred
as
such
well
all
of
a
sudden
when
i
least
expected
it
these
very
men
would
exhibit
such
an
abundance
of
feeling
of
the
best
kind
so
keen
a
comprehension
of
the
sufferings
of
others
seen
in
the
light
of
the
consciousness
of
their
own
that
one
might
almost
fancy
scales
had
fallen
from
their
eyes
so
sudden
was
it
as
to
cause
stupefaction
one
could
scarcely
believe
one
eyes
or
ears
sometimes
it
was
just
the
other
way
educated
men
well
brought
up
would
occasionally
display
a
savage
cynical
brutality
which
nearly
turned
one
stomach
conduct
of
a
kind
impossible
to
excuse
or
justify
however
much
you
might
be
charitably
inclined
to
do
so
i
lay
no
stress
on
the
entire
change
in
the
habits
of
life
the
food
as
to
which
there
come
in
points
where
the
man
of
the
higher
classes
suffers
so
much
more
keenly
than
the
peasant
or
working
man
who
often
goes
hungry
when
free
while
he
always
has
his
in
prison
we
will
leave
all
that
out
let
it
be
admitted
that
for
a
man
with
some
force
of
character
these
external
things
are
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
privations
of
a
quite
different
kind
for
all
that
such
total
change
of
material
conditions
and
habits
is
neither
an
easy
nor
a
slight
thing
but
in
the
convict
there
are
elements
of
horror
before
which
all
other
horrors
pale
even
the
mud
and
filth
everywhere
about
the
scantiness
and
uncleanness
of
the
food
the
irons
on
your
limbs
the
suffocating
sense
of
being
always
held
tight
as
in
a
vice
the
capital
the
most
important
point
of
all
is
that
after
a
couple
of
hours
or
so
every
to
a
convict
establishment
who
is
of
the
lower
class
shakes
down
into
equality
with
the
rest
he
is
among
them
he
has
his
freedom
of
this
city
of
the
enslaved
this
community
of
convicted
scoundrels
in
which
one
man
is
superficially
like
every
other
man
he
understands
and
is
understood
he
is
looked
upon
by
everybody
as
of
now
all
this
is
so
in
the
case
of
the
nobleman
however
kindly
intelligent
a
man
of
the
higher
class
may
be
every
soul
there
will
hate
and
despise
him
during
long
years
they
will
neither
understand
nor
believe
in
him
not
one
whit
he
will
be
neither
friend
nor
comrade
in
their
eyes
if
he
can
get
them
to
stop
insulting
him
it
will
be
as
much
as
he
can
do
but
he
will
be
alien
to
them
from
the
first
to
the
last
he
will
have
to
feel
the
grief
of
a
ceaseless
hopeless
causeless
solitude
and
sequestration
sometimes
it
is
the
case
that
sheer
on
the
part
of
the
prisoners
has
nothing
to
do
with
bringing
about
this
state
of
things
it
simply
can
not
be
helped
the
nobleman
is
not
one
of
the
gang
and
there
the
whole
secret
there
is
nothing
more
horrible
than
to
live
out
of
the
social
sphere
to
which
you
properly
belong
the
peasant
transported
from
taganrog
to
petropavlosk
finds
there
russian
peasants
like
himself
between
him
and
them
there
can
be
mutual
intelligence
in
an
hour
they
will
be
friends
and
live
comfortably
together
in
the
same
izba
or
the
same
barrack
with
the
nobleman
it
is
wholly
otherwise
a
bottomless
abyss
separates
him
from
the
lower
classes
deep
and
impassable
is
only
seen
when
a
nobleman
forfeits
his
position
and
becomes
as
one
of
the
populace
himself
you
may
be
your
whole
life
in
daily
relations
with
the
peasant
forty
years
you
may
do
business
with
him
regularly
as
the
day
comes
let
us
suppose
it
so
at
all
events
by
the
calls
of
official
position
or
administrative
duty
you
may
be
his
benefactor
all
but
a
father
to
him
well
you
never
know
what
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
man
mind
or
heart
you
may
think
you
know
something
about
him
but
it
is
all
optical
illusion
nothing
more
my
readers
will
charge
me
with
exaggeration
but
i
am
convinced
i
am
quite
right
i
do
go
on
theory
or
in
this
in
my
case
the
realities
of
life
have
given
me
only
too
ample
time
and
opportunity
for
reviewing
and
correcting
my
theoretic
convictions
which
as
to
this
are
now
fixed
perhaps
everybody
will
some
day
learn
how
well
founded
i
am
in
what
i
say
about
this
all
this
was
theory
when
i
first
went
into
the
convict
establishment
but
events
and
things
observed
soon
came
to
confirm
me
in
such
views
and
what
i
experienced
so
affected
my
system
as
to
undermine
its
health
during
the
first
summer
i
wandered
about
the
place
so
far
as
i
was
free
to
move
a
solitary
friendless
man
my
moral
situation
was
such
that
i
could
not
distinguish
those
among
the
convicts
who
in
the
sequel
managed
to
care
for
me
a
little
in
spite
of
the
distance
that
always
remained
between
us
there
there
men
of
my
own
position
like
myself
but
their
companionship
was
repugnant
to
me
here
is
one
of
the
incidents
which
obliged
me
to
see
at
the
outset
how
solitary
a
creature
i
was
and
all
the
strangeness
of
my
position
at
the
place
one
day
in
august
a
fine
warm
day
about
one
in
the
afternoon
a
time
when
as
a
rule
everybody
took
a
nap
before
resuming
work
the
convicts
rose
as
one
man
and
massed
themselves
in
the
i
had
not
the
slightest
idea
up
to
that
moment
that
anything
was
going
on
so
deeply
had
i
been
sunk
in
my
own
thoughts
that
i
saw
nearly
nothing
of
what
was
happening
about
me
of
any
kind
but
it
seems
that
the
convicts
had
been
in
a
smouldering
sort
of
unusual
agitation
for
three
days
perhaps
it
had
begun
sooner
so
i
thought
later
when
i
remembered
stray
remarks
bits
of
talk
that
had
come
to
my
ears
the
palpable
increase
of
among
the
prisoners
their
unusual
irritability
for
some
time
past
i
had
attributed
it
all
to
the
trying
summer
work
the
insufferably
long
days
to
their
dreamings
about
the
woods
and
freedom
which
the
season
brought
up
to
the
nights
too
short
for
rest
it
may
be
that
all
these
things
came
together
to
form
a
mass
of
discontent
that
only
wanted
a
tolerably
good
reason
for
exploding
it
was
found
in
the
food
for
several
days
the
convicts
had
not
concealed
their
dissatisfaction
with
it
in
open
talk
in
their
barracks
and
they
showed
it
plainly
when
assembled
for
dinner
or
supper
one
of
the
cooks
had
been
changed
but
after
a
couple
of
days
the
new
comer
was
sent
to
the
and
the
old
one
brought
back
the
restlessness
and
were
general
mischief
was
brewing
here
are
we
slaving
to
death
and
they
give
us
nothing
but
filth
to
eat
grumbled
one
in
the
kitchen
if
you
do
like
it
why
do
you
order
jellies
and
said
another
sour
cabbage
soup
why
that
i
delight
in
it
there
nothing
more
juicy
exclaimed
a
third
well
if
they
gave
you
nothing
but
beef
beef
beef
for
ever
and
ever
would
you
like
yes
yes
they
ought
to
give
us
meat
said
a
fourth
one
almost
killed
at
the
workshops
and
by
heaven
when
one
has
got
through
with
work
there
one
hungry
hungry
and
you
do
get
anything
to
satisfy
your
hunger
it
true
the
victuals
are
simply
damnable
he
fills
his
pockets
do
you
fear
it
is
your
business
whose
business
is
it
my
belly
my
own
if
we
were
all
to
make
a
row
about
it
together
you
soon
see
yes
have
we
been
beaten
enough
for
complaining
dolt
that
you
are
true
enough
what
done
in
a
hurry
is
never
well
done
and
how
would
you
set
about
making
a
raid
over
it
tell
me
that
i
tell
you
by
god
if
everybody
will
go
i
go
too
for
i
just
dying
of
hunger
it
all
very
well
for
those
who
eat
at
a
better
table
apart
to
keep
quiet
but
those
who
eat
the
regulation
food
there
a
fellow
with
eyes
that
do
their
work
bursting
with
envy
is
do
his
eyes
glisten
when
he
sees
something
that
does
belong
to
him
well
pals
why
do
we
make
up
our
minds
have
we
gone
through
enough
they
flay
us
the
brigands
let
go
at
them
what
the
good
i
tell
you
ye
must
chew
what
they
give
you
and
stuff
your
mouth
full
of
it
look
at
the
fellow
he
wants
people
to
chew
his
food
for
him
we
in
prison
and
have
got
to
stand
it
yes
that
it
we
in
prison
that
it
always
the
people
die
of
hunger
and
the
government
fills
its
belly
that
true
our
has
got
finely
fat
over
it
he
bought
a
pair
of
gray
horses
he
do
like
his
glass
at
all
that
fellow
said
a
convict
ironically
he
had
a
bout
at
cards
a
little
while
ago
with
the
vet
for
two
hours
he
played
without
a
in
his
pocket
fedka
told
me
so
that
why
we
get
cabbage
soup
that
fit
for
nothing
you
all
idiots
it
does
matter
matters
i
tell
you
if
we
all
join
in
complaining
we
shall
see
what
he
has
to
say
for
himself
let
make
up
our
minds
for
himself
you
get
his
fist
on
your
pate
that
just
all
i
tell
you
they
have
him
up
and
try
him
all
the
prisoners
were
in
great
agitation
the
truth
is
the
food
was
execrable
the
general
anguish
suffering
and
suspense
seemed
to
be
coming
to
a
head
convicts
are
by
disposition
or
as
such
quarrelsome
and
rebellious
but
a
general
revolt
is
rare
for
they
can
never
agree
upon
it
we
all
of
us
felt
that
since
there
was
as
a
rule
more
violent
talk
than
doing
this
time
however
the
agitation
did
not
fall
to
the
ground
the
men
gathered
in
groups
in
their
barracks
talking
things
over
in
a
violent
way
and
going
over
all
the
particulars
of
the
major
misdoings
and
trying
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
them
in
all
affairs
of
that
sort
there
are
ringleaders
and
firebrands
the
ringleaders
on
such
occasions
are
generally
rather
remarkable
fellows
not
only
in
convict
establishments
but
among
all
large
organisations
of
workmen
military
detachments
etc
they
are
always
people
of
a
peculiar
type
enthusiastic
men
who
have
a
thirst
for
justice
very
naïve
simple
and
strong
convinced
that
their
desires
are
fully
capable
of
realisation
they
have
as
much
sense
as
other
people
some
are
of
high
intelligence
but
they
are
too
full
of
warmth
and
zeal
to
measure
their
acts
when
you
come
across
people
who
really
do
know
how
to
direct
the
masses
and
get
what
they
want
you
find
a
quite
different
sort
of
popular
leaders
and
one
excessively
rare
among
us
russians
the
more
usual
type
of
leader
the
one
i
first
alluded
to
does
certainly
in
some
sense
accomplish
their
object
so
far
as
bringing
about
a
rising
is
concerned
but
it
all
ends
in
filling
up
the
prisons
and
convict
establishments
thanks
to
their
impetuosity
they
always
come
off
but
it
is
this
impetuosity
that
gives
them
their
influences
over
the
masses
their
ardent
honest
indignation
does
its
work
and
draws
in
the
more
irresolute
their
blind
confidence
of
success
seduces
even
the
most
hardened
sceptics
although
this
confidence
is
generally
based
on
such
uncertain
childish
reasons
that
it
is
wonderful
how
people
can
put
faith
in
them
the
secret
of
their
influence
is
that
they
put
themselves
at
the
head
and
ahead
without
flinching
they
dash
forward
heads
down
often
without
the
least
knowledge
worth
the
name
of
what
they
are
about
and
have
nothing
about
them
of
the
jesuitical
practical
faculty
by
dint
of
which
a
vile
and
worthless
man
often
hits
his
mark
and
comes
uppermost
and
will
sometimes
come
all
white
out
of
a
tub
of
ink
they
dash
their
skulls
against
stone
walls
under
ordinary
circumstances
these
people
are
bilious
irascible
intolerant
contemptuous
often
very
warm
which
really
after
all
is
part
of
the
secret
of
their
strength
the
deplorable
thing
is
that
they
never
go
at
what
is
the
essential
the
vital
part
of
their
task
they
always
go
off
at
once
into
details
instead
of
going
straight
to
their
mark
and
this
is
their
ruin
but
they
and
the
mob
understand
one
another
that
makes
them
formidable
i
must
say
a
few
words
about
this
word
grievance
some
of
the
convicts
had
been
transported
in
connection
with
a
grievance
these
were
the
most
excited
among
them
notably
a
certain
martinoff
who
had
formerly
served
in
the
hussars
an
eager
restless
and
choleric
but
a
worthy
and
truthful
fellow
another
vassili
antonoff
could
work
himself
up
into
anger
coolly
and
collectedly
he
had
a
generally
impudent
expression
and
a
sarcastic
smile
but
he
too
was
honest
and
a
man
of
his
word
and
of
no
little
education
i
enumerate
there
were
plenty
of
them
petroff
went
about
in
a
hurried
way
from
one
group
to
another
he
spoke
few
words
but
he
was
quite
as
highly
excited
as
any
one
there
for
he
was
the
first
to
spring
out
of
the
barrack
when
the
others
massed
themselves
in
the
our
sergeant
who
acted
as
came
up
very
soon
in
quite
a
fright
the
convicts
got
into
rank
and
politely
begged
him
to
tell
the
major
that
they
wanted
to
speak
with
him
and
put
him
a
few
questions
behind
the
sergeant
came
all
the
invalids
who
ranked
themselves
in
face
of
the
convicts
what
they
asked
the
sergeant
to
do
frightened
the
man
out
of
his
wits
almost
but
he
dared
not
refuse
to
go
and
report
to
the
major
for
if
the
convicts
mutinied
god
only
knows
what
might
happen
all
the
men
set
over
us
showed
themselves
great
poltroons
in
handling
the
prisoners
then
even
if
nothing
further
worse
happened
if
the
convicts
thought
better
of
it
and
dispersed
the
was
still
in
duty
bound
to
inform
the
authorities
of
what
had
been
going
on
pale
and
trembling
with
fright
he
went
headlong
to
the
major
without
even
an
effort
to
bring
the
convicts
to
reason
he
saw
that
they
were
not
minded
to
put
up
with
any
of
his
talk
no
doubt
without
the
least
idea
of
what
was
going
on
i
went
into
rank
myself
it
was
only
later
that
i
heard
the
earlier
details
of
the
story
i
thought
that
the
was
to
be
called
but
i
did
not
see
the
soldiers
who
verify
the
lists
so
i
was
surprised
and
began
to
look
about
me
a
little
the
men
faces
were
working
with
emotion
and
some
were
ghostly
pale
they
were
sternly
silent
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
what
they
should
say
to
the
major
i
observed
that
many
of
the
convicts
seemed
to
wonder
at
seeing
me
among
them
but
they
turned
their
glances
away
from
me
no
doubt
they
thought
it
strange
that
i
should
come
into
the
ranks
with
them
and
join
in
their
remonstrances
and
could
not
quite
believe
it
then
they
turned
round
to
me
again
in
a
questioning
sort
of
way
what
are
you
doing
here
said
vassili
antonoff
in
a
loud
rude
voice
he
happened
to
be
close
to
me
and
a
little
way
from
the
rest
the
man
had
always
hitherto
been
scrupulously
polite
to
me
i
looked
at
him
in
perplexity
trying
to
understand
what
he
meant
by
it
i
began
to
see
that
something
extraordinary
was
up
in
our
prison
yes
indeed
what
are
you
about
here
go
off
into
the
barrack
said
a
young
fellow
a
whom
i
did
not
know
till
then
and
who
was
a
good
quiet
lad
this
is
none
of
business
have
we
not
fallen
into
rank
i
answered
are
we
going
to
be
mustered
why
come
too
cried
one
of
them
said
another
added
a
third
with
inexpressible
contempt
for
me
in
his
tone
this
new
nickname
caused
a
general
burst
of
laughter
these
fellows
are
in
clover
everywhere
we
are
in
prison
with
hard
labour
i
rather
fancy
they
get
and
like
great
lords
as
they
are
do
you
get
your
victuals
by
yourself
what
are
you
doing
here
your
place
is
not
here
said
koulikoff
to
me
brusquely
taking
me
by
the
hand
and
leading
me
out
of
the
ranks
he
was
himself
very
pale
his
dark
eyes
sparkled
with
fire
he
had
bitten
his
under
lip
till
the
blood
came
he
was
one
of
those
who
expected
the
major
without
losing
i
liked
to
look
at
koulikoff
when
he
was
in
trying
circumstances
like
these
then
he
showed
himself
just
what
he
was
in
his
strong
points
and
weak
he
attitudinised
but
he
knew
how
to
act
too
i
think
he
would
have
gone
to
his
death
with
a
certain
affected
elegance
while
everybody
was
insulting
me
in
words
and
tones
his
politeness
was
greater
than
ever
but
he
spoke
in
a
firm
and
resolved
tone
which
admitted
of
no
reply
we
are
here
on
business
of
our
own
alexander
petrovitch
and
got
to
keep
out
of
it
go
where
you
like
and
wait
till
it
over
here
your
people
are
in
the
kitchens
go
there
they
in
hot
quarters
down
there
i
did
in
fact
see
our
poles
at
the
open
window
of
the
kitchen
in
company
with
a
good
many
other
convicts
i
did
not
well
know
what
to
be
at
but
went
there
followed
by
laughter
insulting
remarks
and
that
sort
of
muttered
growling
which
is
the
prison
substitute
for
the
hissings
and
of
the
world
of
freedom
he
does
like
it
at
all
chu
chu
chu
seize
him
i
had
never
been
so
bitterly
insulted
since
i
was
in
the
place
it
was
a
very
painful
moment
but
just
what
was
to
be
expected
in
the
excessive
excitement
the
men
were
labouring
under
in
the
i
met
t
vski
a
young
nobleman
of
not
much
information
but
of
firm
generous
character
the
convicts
excepted
him
from
the
hatred
they
felt
for
the
convicts
of
noble
birth
they
were
almost
fond
of
him
every
one
of
his
gestures
denoted
the
brave
and
energetic
man
what
are
you
about
goriantchikoff
he
cried
to
me
come
here
come
here
but
what
is
all
about
they
are
going
to
make
a
formal
complaint
do
you
know
it
it
do
them
a
bit
of
good
who
pay
any
attention
to
convicts
they
try
to
find
out
the
ringleaders
and
if
we
are
among
them
they
lay
it
all
on
us
just
remember
what
we
have
been
transported
for
they
only
get
a
whipping
but
we
shall
be
put
regularly
to
trial
the
major
detests
us
all
and
will
be
only
too
happy
to
ruin
us
all
his
sins
will
fall
on
our
shoulders
the
convicts
would
tie
us
hands
and
feet
and
sell
us
directly
added
m
tski
when
we
got
into
the
kitchen
they
never
have
mercy
on
added
t
vski
besides
the
nobles
there
were
in
the
kitchen
about
thirty
other
prisoners
who
did
not
want
to
join
in
the
general
complaints
some
because
they
were
afraid
others
because
of
their
conviction
that
the
whole
proceeding
would
prove
quite
useless
akim
akimitch
who
was
a
decided
opponent
of
everything
that
savoured
of
complaint
or
that
could
interfere
with
discipline
and
the
usual
routine
waited
with
great
phlegm
to
see
the
end
of
the
business
about
which
he
did
not
care
a
jot
he
was
perfectly
convinced
that
the
authorities
would
put
it
all
down
immediately
isaiah
fomitch
nose
drooped
visibly
as
he
listened
in
a
sort
of
frightened
curiosity
to
what
we
said
about
the
affair
he
was
much
disturbed
with
the
polish
nobles
were
some
inferior
persons
of
the
same
nation
as
well
as
some
russians
timid
dull
silent
fellows
who
had
not
dared
to
join
the
rest
and
who
waited
in
a
melancholy
way
to
see
what
the
issue
would
be
there
were
also
some
morose
discontented
convicts
who
remained
in
the
kitchen
not
because
they
were
afraid
but
that
they
thought
this
an
absurdity
which
could
not
succeed
it
seemed
to
me
that
these
were
not
a
little
disturbed
and
their
faces
were
quite
unsteady
they
saw
clearly
that
they
were
in
the
right
and
that
the
issue
of
the
movement
would
be
what
they
had
foretold
but
they
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
they
were
traitors
who
had
sold
their
comrades
to
the
major
jolkin
the
siberian
peasant
sent
to
hard
labour
for
coining
the
man
who
got
town
practice
from
him
was
there
also
as
well
as
the
old
man
of
starodoub
none
of
the
cooks
had
left
their
post
perhaps
because
they
looked
upon
themselves
as
belonging
specially
to
the
authorities
of
the
place
whom
it
would
be
unbecoming
therefore
to
join
in
opposing
for
all
that
said
i
to
m
tski
except
these
fellows
all
the
convicts
are
in
it
and
no
doubt
i
said
it
in
a
way
that
showed
misgivings
i
wonder
what
in
the
world
have
to
do
with
it
growled
b
we
should
have
risked
a
good
deal
more
than
they
had
we
gone
with
them
and
why
hais
ces
why
do
you
think
that
they
bring
themselves
up
to
the
scratch
after
all
i
ca
see
what
they
want
putting
their
heads
in
the
lion
mouth
the
fools
it
all
come
to
nothing
said
some
one
an
obstinate
old
fellow
almazoff
who
was
with
us
too
agreed
heartily
in
this
some
fifty
of
them
will
get
a
good
beating
and
that
all
the
good
they
all
get
out
of
it
here
the
major
cried
one
everybody
ran
to
the
windows
the
major
had
come
up
spectacles
and
all
looking
as
wicked
as
might
be
towering
with
passion
red
as
a
he
came
on
without
a
word
and
in
a
determined
manner
right
up
to
the
line
of
the
convicts
in
conjunctures
of
this
sort
he
showed
uncommon
pluck
and
presence
of
mind
but
it
ought
not
to
be
overlooked
that
he
was
nearly
always
over
just
then
his
greasy
cap
with
its
yellow
border
and
his
tarnished
silver
epaulettes
gave
him
a
mephistophelic
look
in
my
excited
fancy
behind
him
came
the
quartermaster
diatloff
who
was
quite
a
personage
in
the
establishment
for
he
was
really
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
authorities
did
he
was
an
exceedingly
capable
and
cunning
fellow
and
wielded
great
influence
with
the
major
he
was
not
by
any
means
a
bad
sort
of
man
and
the
convicts
were
in
a
general
way
not
towards
him
our
sergeant
followed
him
with
three
or
four
soldiers
no
more
he
had
already
had
a
tremendous
wigging
and
there
was
plenty
more
of
the
same
to
come
if
he
knew
it
the
convicts
who
had
remained
uncovered
cap
in
hand
from
the
moment
they
sent
for
the
major
stiffened
themselves
every
man
shifting
his
weight
to
the
other
leg
then
they
remained
motionless
and
waited
for
the
first
word
or
the
first
shout
rather
to
come
from
him
they
had
not
long
to
wait
before
he
had
got
more
than
one
word
out
the
major
began
to
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
we
saw
him
from
the
windows
running
all
along
the
line
of
convicts
dashing
at
them
here
and
there
with
angry
questions
as
we
were
a
pretty
good
distance
off
we
could
not
hear
what
he
said
or
their
replies
we
only
heard
his
shouts
or
rather
what
seemed
shouting
groaning
and
grunting
beautifully
mingled
scoundrels
mutineers
to
the
cat
with
ye
whips
and
sticks
the
ringleaders
one
of
the
ringleaders
throwing
himself
on
one
of
them
we
did
not
hear
the
answer
but
a
minute
after
we
saw
this
convict
leave
the
ranks
and
make
for
the
another
followed
then
a
third
i
have
you
up
every
man
of
you
i
who
in
the
kitchen
there
he
bawled
as
he
saw
us
at
the
open
windows
here
with
all
of
you
drive
all
out
every
man
diatloff
the
quartermaster
came
towards
the
kitchens
when
we
had
told
him
that
were
not
complaining
of
any
grievance
he
returned
and
reported
to
the
major
at
once
ah
those
fellows
are
not
in
it
said
he
lowering
his
tone
a
bit
and
much
pleased
never
mind
bring
them
along
here
we
left
the
kitchen
i
could
not
help
feeling
humiliation
all
of
us
went
along
with
our
heads
down
ah
prokofief
jolkin
too
and
you
almazof
here
come
here
all
the
lump
of
you
cried
the
major
to
us
with
a
gasp
but
he
was
somewhat
softened
his
tone
was
even
obliging
m
tski
you
here
too
take
down
the
names
diatloff
take
down
all
the
names
the
grumblers
in
one
list
and
the
contented
ones
in
another
all
without
exception
give
me
the
list
i
have
you
all
before
the
committee
of
superintendence
i
brigands
this
word
told
we
nothing
to
complain
of
cried
one
of
the
malcontents
in
a
sort
of
voice
ah
you
nothing
to
complain
of
that
let
all
those
who
have
nothing
to
complain
of
step
out
of
the
ranks
all
of
us
all
of
us
came
from
some
others
ah
the
food
is
all
right
then
you
been
put
up
to
it
ringleaders
mutineers
eh
so
much
the
worse
for
them
but
what
do
you
mean
by
that
came
from
a
voice
in
the
crowd
where
is
the
fellow
that
said
that
roared
the
major
throwing
himself
to
where
the
voice
came
from
it
was
you
rastorgouïef
you
to
the
with
you
rastorgouïef
a
young
chubby
fellow
of
high
stature
left
the
ranks
and
went
with
slow
steps
to
the
it
was
not
he
who
had
said
it
but
as
he
was
called
out
he
did
not
venture
to
contradict
you
fellows
are
too
fat
that
what
makes
you
unruly
shouted
the
major
you
wait
you
hulking
rascal
in
three
days
you
wait
have
it
out
with
you
all
let
all
those
who
have
nothing
to
complain
of
come
out
of
the
ranks
i
say
we
not
complaining
of
anything
your
worship
said
some
of
the
convicts
with
a
sombre
air
the
rest
preserved
an
obstinate
silence
but
the
major
wanted
nothing
further
it
was
his
interest
to
stop
the
thing
with
as
little
friction
as
might
be
ah
i
see
has
anything
to
complain
of
said
he
i
knew
it
i
saw
it
all
it
ringleaders
there
are
ringleaders
by
god
he
went
on
speaking
to
diatloff
we
must
lay
our
hands
on
them
every
man
of
them
and
now
now
it
time
to
go
to
your
work
drummer
there
drummer
a
roll
he
told
them
off
himself
in
small
detachments
the
convicts
dispersed
sadly
and
silently
only
too
glad
to
get
out
of
his
sight
immediately
after
the
gangs
went
off
the
major
betook
himself
to
the
where
he
began
to
make
his
dispositions
as
to
the
ringleaders
but
he
did
not
push
matters
far
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
wanted
to
be
done
with
the
whole
business
as
soon
as
possible
one
of
the
men
charged
told
us
later
that
he
had
begged
for
forgiveness
and
that
the
officer
had
let
him
go
immediately
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
our
major
did
not
feel
firm
in
the
saddle
he
had
had
a
fright
i
fancy
for
a
mutiny
is
always
a
ticklish
thing
and
although
this
complaint
of
the
convicts
about
the
food
did
not
amount
really
to
mutiny
only
the
major
had
been
reported
to
about
it
and
the
governor
himself
yet
it
was
an
uncomfortable
and
dangerous
affair
what
gave
him
most
anxiety
was
that
the
prisoners
had
been
unanimous
in
their
movement
so
their
discontent
had
to
be
got
over
somehow
at
any
price
the
ringleaders
were
soon
set
free
next
day
the
food
was
passable
but
this
improvement
did
not
last
long
on
the
days
ensuing
the
disturbance
the
major
went
about
the
prison
much
more
than
usual
and
always
found
something
irregular
to
be
stopped
and
punished
our
sergeant
came
and
went
in
a
puzzled
dazed
sort
of
way
as
if
he
could
not
get
over
his
stupefaction
at
what
had
happened
as
to
the
convicts
it
took
long
for
them
to
quiet
down
again
but
their
agitation
seemed
to
wear
quite
a
different
character
they
were
restless
and
perplexed
some
went
about
with
their
heads
down
without
saying
a
word
others
discussed
the
event
in
a
grumbling
helpless
kind
of
way
a
good
many
said
biting
things
about
their
own
proceedings
as
though
they
were
quite
out
of
conceit
with
themselves
i
say
pal
take
and
eat
said
one
where
the
mouse
that
was
so
ready
to
bell
the
cat
let
think
ourselves
lucky
that
he
did
not
have
us
all
well
beaten
it
would
be
a
good
deal
better
if
you
thought
more
and
chattered
less
what
do
mean
by
lecturing
me
are
you
schoolmaster
here
i
like
to
know
oh
you
want
putting
to
the
who
are
you
i
like
to
know
i
a
man
what
are
you
a
man
you
you
i
say
shut
up
do
what
the
good
of
all
this
row
was
the
cry
from
all
sides
on
the
evening
of
the
day
the
mutiny
took
place
i
met
petroff
behind
the
barracks
after
the
day
work
he
was
looking
for
me
as
he
came
near
me
i
heard
him
exclaim
something
which
i
did
understand
in
a
muttering
sort
of
way
then
he
said
no
more
and
walked
by
my
side
in
a
listless
mechanical
fashion
i
say
petroff
your
fellows
are
not
vexed
with
us
are
they
who
vexed
he
asked
as
if
coming
to
himself
the
convicts
with
us
with
us
nobles
why
should
they
be
vexed
well
because
we
did
not
back
them
up
oh
why
should
you
have
kicked
up
a
dust
he
answered
as
if
trying
to
enter
into
my
meaning
you
have
a
table
to
yourselves
you
fellows
oh
well
there
are
some
of
you
not
nobles
who
do
eat
the
regulation
food
and
who
went
in
with
you
we
ought
to
back
you
up
we
in
the
same
place
we
ought
to
be
comrades
oh
i
are
you
our
comrades
he
asked
with
unfeigned
astonishment
i
looked
at
him
it
was
clear
that
he
had
not
the
least
comprehension
of
my
meaning
but
i
on
the
other
hand
entered
only
too
thoroughly
into
his
i
saw
now
quite
thoroughly
something
of
which
i
had
before
only
a
confused
idea
what
i
had
before
guessed
at
was
now
sad
certainty
it
was
forced
on
my
perceptions
that
any
sort
of
real
fellowship
between
the
convicts
and
myself
could
never
be
not
even
were
i
to
remain
in
the
place
as
long
as
life
should
last
i
was
a
convict
of
the
special
section
a
creature
for
ever
apart
the
expression
of
petroff
when
he
said
are
we
comrades
how
can
that
be
remains
and
will
always
remain
before
my
eyes
there
was
a
look
of
such
frank
naïve
surprise
in
it
such
ingenuous
astonishment
that
i
could
not
help
asking
myself
if
there
was
not
some
lurking
irony
in
the
man
just
a
little
spiteful
mockery
not
at
all
it
was
simply
meant
i
was
not
their
comrade
and
could
not
be
that
was
all
go
you
to
the
right
we
go
to
the
left
your
business
is
yours
ours
is
ours
i
really
fancied
that
after
the
mutiny
they
would
attack
us
mercilessly
so
far
as
they
dared
and
could
and
that
our
life
would
become
a
hell
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
we
did
not
hear
the
slightest
reproach
there
was
not
even
an
unpleasant
allusion
to
what
had
happened
it
was
all
simply
passed
over
they
went
on
teasing
us
as
before
when
opportunity
served
no
more
nobody
seemed
to
bear
malice
against
those
who
would
not
join
in
but
remained
in
the
kitchens
or
against
those
who
were
the
first
to
cry
out
that
they
had
nothing
to
complain
of
it
was
all
passed
over
without
a
word
to
my
exceeding
astonishment
footnotes
an
insulting
phrase
which
is
untranslatable

in
the
original

my
companions
as
will
be
understood
those
to
whom
i
was
most
drawn
were
people
of
my
own
sort
that
is
those
of
noble
birth
especially
in
the
early
days
but
of
the
three
in
the
place
who
were
russians
i
knew
and
spoke
to
but
one
akim
akimitch
the
other
two
were
the
spy
a
n
and
the
supposed
parricide
even
with
akim
i
never
exchanged
a
word
except
when
in
extremity
in
moments
when
the
melancholy
on
me
was
simply
unendurable
and
when
i
thought
i
really
never
should
have
the
chance
of
getting
close
to
any
other
human
being
again
in
the
last
chapter
i
have
tried
to
show
that
the
convicts
were
of
different
types
and
tried
to
classify
them
but
when
i
think
of
akim
akimitch
i
do
know
how
to
place
him
he
was
quite
so
far
as
i
could
observe
in
that
establishment
there
may
be
elsewhere
men
like
him
to
whom
it
seemed
as
absolutely
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
he
was
a
free
man
or
in
jail
at
hard
labour
at
that
place
he
stood
alone
in
this
curious
impartiality
of
temperament
he
had
settled
down
in
the
jail
as
if
he
was
going
to
pass
his
whole
life
and
did
mind
it
at
all
all
his
belongings
mattress
cushions
utensils
were
so
ordered
as
to
give
the
impression
that
he
was
living
in
a
furnished
house
of
his
own
there
was
nothing
provisional
temporary
about
him
or
his
words
or
his
habits
he
had
a
good
many
years
still
to
spend
in
punishment
but
i
much
doubt
whether
he
ever
gave
a
thought
to
the
time
when
he
would
get
out
he
was
entirely
reconciled
to
his
condition
not
because
he
had
made
any
effort
to
be
so
but
simply
out
of
natural
submissiveness
but
as
far
as
his
comfort
went
it
came
to
the
same
thing
he
was
not
at
all
a
bad
fellow
and
in
the
early
days
his
advice
and
help
were
quite
useful
to
me
but
sometimes
i
ca
help
saying
it
his
peculiarities
deepened
my
natural
melancholy
until
it
became
almost
intolerable
anguish
when
i
became
desperate
with
silence
and
solitude
of
soul
i
would
get
into
talk
with
him
i
wanted
to
hear
and
reply
to
words
falling
from
a
living
soul
and
the
more
filled
with
gall
and
hatred
with
all
our
surroundings
they
had
been
the
more
would
they
have
been
in
sympathy
with
my
wretched
mood
but
he
would
just
barely
talk
quietly
go
on
sizing
his
lanterns
and
then
begin
to
tell
me
some
story
as
to
how
he
had
been
at
a
review
of
troops
in
that
their
general
of
division
was
that
the
manoeuvring
had
been
very
pretty
that
there
had
been
a
change
in
the
skirmisher
system
of
signalling
and
the
like
all
of
it
in
level
imperturbable
tones
like
water
falling
drop
by
drop
he
did
not
put
any
life
into
them
even
when
he
told
me
of
a
sharp
affair
in
which
he
had
been
in
the
caucasus
for
which
his
sword
had
got
the
decoration
of
the
riband
of
anne
the
only
difference
was
that
his
voice
became
a
little
more
measured
and
grave
he
lowered
his
tones
when
he
pronounced
the
name
anne
as
though
he
were
telling
a
great
secret
and
then
for
three
minutes
at
least
did
not
utter
a
word
but
only
looked
solemn
during
all
that
first
year
i
had
strange
passages
of
feeling
in
which
i
hated
akim
akimitch
with
a
bitter
hatred
i
am
sure
i
can
not
say
why
moments
when
i
would
despairingly
curse
the
fate
which
made
him
my
next
neighbour
on
my
so
close
indeed
that
our
heads
nearly
touched
an
hour
afterwards
i
bitterly
reproached
myself
for
such
extravagance
it
was
however
only
during
my
first
year
of
confinement
that
these
violent
feelings
overpowered
me
as
time
went
on
i
got
used
to
akim
akimitch
singular
character
and
was
ashamed
of
my
former
explosions
i
do
remember
that
he
and
i
ever
got
into
anything
like
an
open
quarrel
besides
the
three
russian
nobles
of
whom
i
have
spoken
there
were
eight
others
there
during
my
time
with
some
of
whom
i
came
to
be
on
a
footing
of
intimate
friendship
even
the
best
of
them
were
morbid
in
mind
exclusive
and
intolerant
to
the
very
last
degree
with
two
of
them
i
was
obliged
to
discontinue
all
spoken
intercourse
there
were
only
three
who
had
any
education
b
ski
m
tski
and
the
old
man
j
ski
who
had
formerly
been
a
professor
of
mathematics
an
excellent
fellow
highly
eccentric
and
of
very
narrow
mental
horizon
in
spite
of
his
learning
m
tski
and
b
ski
were
of
a
mould
quite
different
from
his
between
m
tski
and
myself
there
was
an
excellent
understanding
from
the
first
he
and
i
never
once
got
into
any
sort
of
dispute
i
respected
him
highly
but
could
never
become
sincerely
attached
to
him
though
i
tried
to
he
was
sour
embittered
and
mistrustful
with
much
this
was
quite
antipathetic
to
me
the
man
had
a
closed
soul
closed
to
everybody
and
he
made
you
feel
it
i
felt
it
so
strongly
that
perhaps
i
was
wrong
about
it
after
all
his
character
i
must
say
was
stamped
with
both
nobleness
and
strength
his
inveterate
scepticism
made
him
very
prudent
in
his
relations
with
everybody
about
him
and
in
conducting
these
he
gave
proof
of
remarkable
tact
and
skill
sceptic
as
he
was
there
was
another
and
a
reverse
side
in
his
nature
for
in
some
things
he
was
a
profound
and
unalterable
believer
with
faith
and
hope
unshakable
in
spite
of
his
tact
in
dealing
with
men
he
got
into
open
hostilities
with
b
ski
and
his
friend
t
ski
the
first
of
these
b
ski
was
a
man
of
infirm
health
of
consumptive
tendency
irascible
and
of
a
weak
nervous
system
but
a
good
and
generous
man
his
nervous
irritability
went
so
far
that
he
was
as
capricious
as
a
child
a
temperament
of
that
kind
was
too
much
for
me
there
so
i
soon
saw
as
little
of
b
ski
as
i
could
possibly
help
though
i
never
ceased
to
like
him
much
it
was
just
the
other
way
so
far
as
m
tski
was
concerned
with
him
i
always
was
on
easy
terms
though
i
did
not
like
him
at
all
when
i
edged
away
from
b
ski
i
had
to
break
also
more
or
less
with
t
ski
of
whom
i
spoke
in
the
last
chapter
which
i
much
regretted
for
though
of
little
education
he
had
an
excellent
heart
a
worthy
very
spiritual
man
he
loved
and
respected
b
ski
so
much
that
those
who
broke
with
that
friend
of
his
he
regarded
as
his
personal
enemies
he
quarrelled
with
m
tski
on
account
of
b
ski
and
they
kept
up
the
difference
a
long
while
all
these
people
were
as
bilious
as
they
could
be
humoursome
mistrustful
the
victims
of
a
moral
and
physical
supersensitiveness
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
their
position
was
trying
indeed
much
more
so
than
ours
they
were
all
exiled
transported
for
ten
or
twelve
years
and
what
made
their
sojourn
in
the
prison
most
distressing
to
them
was
their
rooted
ingrained
prejudice
especially
their
unfortunate
way
of
regarding
the
convicts
which
they
could
not
get
over
in
their
eyes
the
unhappy
fellows
were
mere
wild
beasts
without
a
single
recognisable
human
quality
everything
in
their
previous
career
and
their
present
circumstances
combined
to
produce
this
unhappy
feeling
in
them
their
life
at
the
jail
was
perpetual
torment
to
them
they
were
kindly
and
conversible
with
the
circassians
with
the
tartars
with
isaiah
fomitch
but
for
the
other
prisoners
they
had
nothing
but
contempt
and
aversion
the
only
one
they
had
any
real
respect
for
was
the
aged
old
believer
for
all
this
during
all
the
time
i
spent
at
the
convict
establishment
i
never
knew
a
single
prisoner
to
reproach
them
with
either
their
birth
or
religious
opinions
or
convictions
as
is
so
usual
with
our
common
people
in
their
relations
with
people
of
different
condition
especially
if
these
happen
to
be
foreigners
the
fact
is
they
can
not
take
the
foreigner
seriously
to
the
russian
common
people
he
seems
a
merely
grotesque
comical
creature
our
convicts
had
and
showed
much
more
respect
for
the
polish
nobles
than
for
us
russians
but
i
do
think
the
poles
cared
about
the
matter
or
took
any
notice
of
the
difference
i
spoke
just
now
of
t
ski
and
have
something
more
to
say
of
him
when
he
had
with
his
friend
to
leave
the
first
place
assigned
to
them
as
residence
in
their
banishment
to
come
to
our
fortress
he
carried
his
friend
b
nearly
the
whole
way
b
was
of
quite
a
weak
frame
and
in
bad
health
and
became
exhausted
before
half
of
the
first
march
was
accomplished
they
had
first
been
banished
to
y
gorsk
where
they
lived
in
tolerable
comfort
life
was
much
less
hard
there
than
in
our
fortress
but
in
consequence
of
a
correspondence
with
the
exiles
in
one
of
the
other
towns
a
quite
innocent
exchange
of
letters
it
was
thought
necessary
to
remove
them
to
our
jail
to
be
under
the
more
direct
surveillance
of
the
government
until
they
came
m
tski
had
been
quite
alone
and
dreadful
must
have
been
his
sufferings
in
that
first
year
of
his
banishment
j
ski
was
the
old
man
always
deep
in
prayer
of
whom
i
spoke
a
little
earlier
all
the
political
convicts
were
quite
young
men
while
j
ski
was
at
least
fifty
years
old
he
was
a
worthy
gentlemanlike
person
if
eccentric
t
ski
and
b
ski
detested
him
and
never
spoke
to
him
they
insisted
upon
it
that
he
was
too
obstinate
and
troublesome
to
put
up
with
and
i
was
obliged
to
admit
it
was
so
i
believe
that
at
a
convict
establishment
as
in
every
place
where
people
have
to
be
together
whether
they
like
it
or
not
people
are
more
ready
to
quarrel
with
and
detest
one
another
than
under
other
circumstances
many
causes
contributed
to
the
squabbles
that
were
unfortunately
always
going
on
j
ski
was
really
disagreeable
and
not
one
of
those
about
him
was
on
good
terms
with
him
he
and
i
did
not
come
to
a
rupture
but
we
were
never
on
a
really
friendly
footing
i
fancy
that
he
was
a
strong
mathematician
one
day
he
explained
to
me
in
his
jargon
a
system
of
astronomy
of
his
own
i
have
been
told
that
he
had
written
a
work
upon
the
subject
which
the
learned
world
had
received
with
derision
i
fancy
his
reasonings
on
some
things
had
got
twisted
he
used
to
be
on
his
knees
praying
for
a
whole
day
sometimes
which
made
the
convicts
respect
him
exceedingly
during
the
remnant
of
life
he
had
to
pass
there
he
died
under
my
eyes
at
the
jail
after
a
very
trying
illness
he
had
won
the
consideration
of
the
prisoners
from
the
first
moment
of
his
coming
in
on
account
of
what
had
happened
with
the
major
and
him
when
they
were
brought
afoot
from
y
gorsk
to
our
fortress
they
were
not
shaved
on
the
road
at
all
their
hair
and
beards
had
grown
to
great
lengths
when
they
were
brought
before
the
major
that
worthy
foamed
like
a
madman
he
was
wild
with
indignation
at
such
infraction
of
discipline
though
it
was
none
of
their
fault
my
god
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
he
roared
they
are
vagabonds
brigands
j
ski
knew
very
little
russian
and
fancied
that
he
was
asking
them
if
they
were
brigands
or
vagabonds
so
he
answered
we
are
political
prisoners
not
rogues
and
vagabonds
you
mean
impudence
clod
howled
the
major
to
the
with
him
a
hundred
strokes
of
the
rod
at
once
this
instant
i
say
they
gave
the
old
man
the
punishment
he
lay
flat
on
the
ground
under
the
strokes
without
the
slightest
resistance
kept
his
hand
in
his
teeth
and
bore
it
all
without
a
murmur
and
without
moving
a
muscle
b
ski
and
t
ski
arrived
at
the
jail
as
this
was
all
going
on
and
m
ski
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
principal
gate
knowing
that
they
were
just
coming
in
he
threw
himself
on
their
neck
although
he
had
never
seen
them
before
utterly
disgusted
at
the
way
the
major
had
received
them
they
told
m
ski
all
about
the
cruel
business
that
had
just
occurred
m
ski
told
me
later
that
he
was
quite
beside
himself
with
rage
when
he
heard
it
i
could
not
contain
myself
for
passion
he
said
i
shook
as
though
with
ague
i
waited
for
j
ski
at
the
great
gate
for
he
would
come
straight
that
way
from
the
after
his
punishment
the
gate
was
opened
and
there
i
saw
pass
before
me
j
ski
his
lips
all
white
and
trembling
his
face
pale
as
death
he
did
not
look
at
a
single
person
and
passed
through
the
groups
of
convicts
assembled
in
the
they
knew
a
noble
had
just
been
subjected
to
punishment
went
into
the
barrack
went
straight
to
his
place
and
without
a
word
dropped
down
on
his
knees
for
prayer
the
prisoners
were
surprised
and
even
affected
when
i
saw
this
old
man
with
white
hairs
who
had
left
behind
him
at
home
a
wife
and
children
kneeling
and
praying
after
that
scandalous
treatment
i
rushed
away
from
the
barrack
and
for
a
couple
of
hours
felt
as
if
i
had
gone
stark
staring
raving
mad
or
blind
drunk
from
that
first
moment
the
convicts
were
full
of
deference
and
consideration
for
j
ski
what
particularly
pleased
them
was
that
he
did
not
utter
a
cry
when
undergoing
the
punishment
but
one
must
be
fair
and
tell
the
truth
about
this
sort
of
thing
this
sad
story
is
not
an
instance
of
what
frequently
occurs
in
the
treatment
by
the
authorities
of
transported
noblemen
russian
or
polish
and
this
isolated
case
affords
no
basis
for
passing
judgment
upon
that
treatment
my
anecdote
merely
shows
that
you
may
light
upon
a
bad
man
anywhere
and
everywhere
and
if
it
happen
that
such
a
one
is
in
absolute
command
of
a
jail
and
if
he
happen
to
have
a
grudge
against
one
of
the
prisoners
the
lot
of
such
a
one
will
be
indeed
very
far
from
enviable
but
the
administrative
chiefs
who
regulate
and
supervise
convict
labour
in
siberia
and
from
whom
subordinates
take
their
tone
as
well
as
their
orders
are
careful
to
exercise
a
discriminating
treatment
in
the
case
of
persons
of
noble
birth
and
in
some
cases
grant
them
special
indulgences
as
compared
with
the
lot
of
convicts
of
lower
condition
there
are
obvious
reasons
for
this
these
heads
of
departments
are
nobles
themselves
they
know
that
men
of
that
class
must
not
be
driven
to
extremity
cases
have
been
known
where
nobles
have
refused
to
submit
to
corporal
punishment
and
flung
themselves
desperately
on
their
tormentors
with
very
grave
and
serious
consequences
indeed
moreover
and
this
i
think
is
the
leading
cause
of
the
good
treatment
some
time
ago
years
at
least
there
were
transported
to
siberia
quite
a
crowd
of
noblemen
these
were
of
such
correct
and
irreproachable
demeanour
and
held
themselves
so
high
that
the
heads
of
departments
fell
into
the
way
which
they
never
afterwards
left
of
regarding
criminals
of
noble
birth
and
ordinary
convicts
in
quite
a
different
manner
and
men
in
lower
place
took
their
cue
from
them
many
of
these
no
doubt
were
little
pleased
with
that
disposition
in
their
superiors
such
persons
were
pleased
enough
when
they
could
do
exactly
as
they
liked
in
the
matter
but
this
did
not
often
happen
they
were
kept
well
within
bounds
i
have
reason
to
be
satisfied
of
this
and
i
will
say
why
i
was
put
in
the
second
category
a
classification
of
those
condemned
to
hard
labour
which
was
primarily
and
principally
composed
of
convicts
who
had
been
serfs
under
military
superintendence
now
this
second
category
or
class
was
much
harder
than
the
first
of
the
mines
or
the
third
manufacturing
work
it
was
harder
not
only
for
the
nobles
but
for
the
other
convicts
too
because
the
governing
and
administrative
methods
and
in
it
were
wholly
military
and
were
pretty
much
the
same
in
type
as
those
of
the
convict
establishments
in
russia
the
men
in
official
position
were
severer
the
general
treatment
more
rigorous
than
in
the
two
other
classes
the
men
were
never
out
of
irons
an
escort
of
soldiers
was
always
present
you
were
always
or
nearly
so
within
stone
walls
and
things
were
quite
different
in
the
other
classes
at
least
so
the
convicts
said
and
there
were
those
among
them
who
had
every
reason
to
know
they
would
all
have
gladly
gone
off
to
the
mines
which
the
law
classified
as
the
worst
and
last
punishment
it
was
their
constant
dream
and
desire
to
do
so
all
those
who
had
been
in
the
russian
convict
establishments
spoke
with
horror
of
them
and
declared
that
there
was
no
hell
like
them
that
siberia
was
a
paradise
compared
with
confinement
in
the
fortresses
in
russia
if
then
it
is
the
case
that
we
nobles
were
treated
with
special
consideration
in
the
establishment
i
was
confined
in
which
was
under
direct
control
of
the
and
administered
entirely
on
military
principles
there
must
have
been
some
greater
kindliness
in
the
treatment
of
the
convicts
of
the
first
and
third
category
or
class
i
think
i
can
speak
with
some
authority
about
what
went
on
throughout
siberia
in
these
respects
and
i
based
my
views
as
to
this
upon
all
that
i
heard
from
convicts
of
these
classes
we
in
our
prison
were
under
much
more
rigorous
surveillance
than
was
elsewhere
practised
we
were
favoured
with
no
sort
of
exemptions
from
the
ordinary
rules
as
regards
work
and
confinement
and
the
wearing
of
chains
we
could
not
do
anything
for
ourselves
to
get
immunity
from
the
rules
for
i
at
least
knew
quite
well
that
the
good
old
time
which
was
quite
of
there
had
been
so
much
intriguing
to
undermine
the
credit
of
officials
that
the
authorities
were
greatly
afraid
of
informers
and
that
as
things
stood
to
show
indulgence
to
a
convict
was
regarded
as
a
crime
everybody
therefore
authorities
and
convicts
alike
was
in
fear
of
what
might
happen
we
of
the
nobles
were
thus
quite
down
to
the
level
of
the
other
convicts
the
only
point
we
were
favoured
in
was
in
regard
to
corporal
punishment
but
i
think
that
we
should
have
had
even
that
inflicted
on
us
had
we
done
anything
for
which
it
was
prescribed
for
equality
as
to
punishment
was
strictly
enjoined
or
practised
what
i
mean
is
that
we
were
not
wantonly
causelessly
mishandled
like
the
other
prisoners
when
the
governor
got
to
know
of
the
punishment
inflicted
on
j
ski
he
was
seriously
angry
with
the
major
and
ordered
him
to
be
more
careful
for
the
future
the
thing
got
very
generally
known
we
learned
also
that
the
who
had
great
confidence
in
our
major
and
who
liked
him
because
of
his
exact
observance
of
legal
bounds
and
thought
highly
of
his
qualities
in
the
service
gave
him
a
sharp
scolding
and
our
major
took
the
lesson
to
heart
i
have
no
doubt
it
was
this
prevented
his
having
m
ski
beaten
which
he
would
much
have
liked
to
do
being
much
influenced
by
the
slanderous
things
a
f
said
about
m
but
the
major
could
never
get
a
fair
pretext
for
doing
so
however
much
he
persecuted
and
set
spies
upon
his
proposed
victim
so
he
had
to
deny
himself
that
pleasure
the
j
ski
affair
became
known
all
through
the
town
and
public
opinion
condemned
the
major
some
persons
reproached
him
openly
for
what
he
had
done
and
some
even
insulted
him
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
man
crossed
my
path
may
as
well
be
mentioned
we
had
alarming
things
reported
to
us
to
me
and
another
nobleman
under
sentence
about
the
abominable
character
of
this
man
while
we
were
still
at
tobolsk
men
who
had
been
sentenced
a
long
while
back
to
years
of
the
misery
nobles
as
we
were
and
who
had
visited
us
so
kindly
during
our
provisional
sojourn
in
the
first
prison
had
warned
us
what
sort
of
man
we
were
to
be
under
they
had
also
promised
to
do
all
they
could
for
us
with
their
friends
to
see
that
he
hurt
us
as
little
as
possible
and
in
fact
they
did
write
to
the
three
daughters
of
the
who
i
believe
interceded
on
our
behalf
with
their
father
but
what
could
he
do
no
more
of
course
than
tell
the
major
to
be
fair
in
applying
the
rules
and
regulations
to
our
case
it
was
about
three
in
the
afternoon
that
my
companion
and
myself
arrived
in
the
town
our
escort
took
us
at
once
to
our
tyrant
we
remained
waiting
for
him
in
the
while
they
went
to
find
the
at
the
prison
as
soon
as
the
latter
had
come
in
walked
the
major
we
saw
an
inflamed
scarlet
face
that
boded
no
good
and
affected
us
quite
painfully
he
seemed
like
a
sort
of
spider
about
to
throw
itself
on
a
poor
fly
wriggling
in
its
web
what
your
name
man
said
he
to
my
companion
he
spoke
with
a
harsh
jerky
voice
as
if
he
wanted
to
overawe
us
my
friend
gave
his
name
and
you
said
he
turning
to
me
and
glaring
at
me
behind
his
spectacles
i
gave
mine
sergeant
take
to
the
prison
and
let
be
shaved
at
the
hair
off
half
their
skulls
and
let
be
put
in
irons
why
what
sort
of
cloaks
have
you
got
there
said
he
brutally
when
he
saw
the
gray
cloaks
with
yellow
sewn
at
the
back
which
they
had
given
to
us
at
tobolsk
why
that
a
new
uniform
begad
a
new
uniform
they
always
getting
up
something
or
other
that
a
petersburg
trick
he
said
as
he
inspected
us
one
after
the
other
got
anything
with
them
he
said
abruptly
to
the
gendarme
who
escorted
us
they
got
their
own
clothes
your
worship
replied
he
and
the
man
carried
arms
just
as
if
on
parade
not
without
a
nervous
tremor
everybody
knew
the
fellow
and
was
afraid
of
him
take
their
clothes
away
from
them
they
ca
keep
anything
but
their
linen
their
white
things
take
away
all
their
coloured
things
if
they
got
any
and
sell
them
off
at
the
next
sale
and
put
the
money
to
the
prison
account
a
convict
has
no
property
said
he
looking
severely
at
us
hark
ye
behave
prettily
do
let
me
have
any
complaining
if
i
do
the
smallest
offence
and
to
the
sticks
you
go
this
way
of
receiving
me
so
different
from
anything
i
had
ever
known
made
me
nearly
ill
that
night
it
was
a
frightful
thing
to
happen
at
the
very
moment
of
entering
the
infernal
place
but
i
have
already
told
that
part
of
my
story
thus
we
had
no
sort
of
exemption
or
immunity
from
any
of
the
miseries
inflicted
there
no
lightening
of
our
labours
when
with
the
other
convicts
but
friends
tried
to
help
us
by
getting
us
sent
for
three
months
b
ski
and
me
to
the
bureau
of
the
engineers
to
do
copying
work
this
was
done
quietly
and
as
much
as
possible
kept
from
being
talked
about
or
observed
this
piece
of
kindness
was
done
for
us
by
the
head
engineers
during
the
short
time
that
g
kof
was
governor
at
our
prison
this
gentleman
had
command
there
only
for
six
short
months
for
he
soon
went
back
to
russia
he
really
seemed
to
us
all
like
an
angel
of
goodness
sent
from
heaven
and
the
feeling
for
him
among
the
convicts
was
of
the
strongest
kind
it
was
not
mere
love
it
was
something
like
adoration
i
can
not
help
saying
so
how
he
did
it
i
do
know
but
their
hearts
went
out
to
him
from
the
moment
they
first
set
eyes
on
him
he
more
like
a
father
than
anything
else
the
prisoners
kept
continually
saying
during
all
the
time
he
was
there
at
the
head
of
the
engineering
department
he
was
a
brilliant
joyous
fellow
he
was
of
low
stature
with
a
bold
confident
expression
and
he
was
all
gracious
kindness
to
the
convicts
for
whom
he
really
did
seem
to
entertain
a
fatherly
sort
of
affection
how
was
it
he
was
so
fond
of
them
it
is
hard
to
say
but
he
seemed
never
to
be
able
to
pass
a
prisoner
without
a
bit
of
pleasant
talk
and
a
little
laughing
and
joking
together
there
was
nothing
that
smacked
of
authority
in
his
pleasantries
nothing
that
reminded
them
of
his
position
over
them
he
behaved
just
as
if
he
was
one
of
themselves
in
spite
of
this
kind
condescension
i
do
remember
any
one
of
the
convicts
ever
failing
in
respect
to
him
or
taking
the
slightest
liberty
quite
the
other
way
the
convict
face
would
light
up
in
a
wonderful
sudden
way
when
he
met
the
governor
it
was
odd
to
see
how
the
face
smiled
all
over
and
the
hand
went
to
the
cap
when
the
governor
was
seen
in
the
distance
making
for
the
poor
man
a
word
from
him
was
regarded
as
a
signal
honour
there
are
some
people
like
that
who
know
how
to
win
all
hearts
g
kof
had
a
bold
jaunty
air
walked
with
long
strides
holding
himself
very
straight
a
regular
eagle
the
convicts
used
to
call
him
he
could
not
do
much
to
lighten
their
lot
materially
for
his
office
was
that
of
superintending
the
engineering
work
which
had
to
be
done
in
ways
and
quantities
settled
absolutely
and
unalterably
by
the
regulations
but
if
he
happened
to
come
across
a
gang
of
convicts
who
had
actually
got
through
their
work
he
allowed
them
to
go
back
to
quarters
before
beat
of
drum
without
waiting
for
the
regulation
moment
the
prisoners
loved
him
for
the
confidence
he
showed
in
them
and
because
of
his
aversion
for
all
mean
trifling
interferences
with
them
which
are
so
irritating
when
prison
superiors
are
addicted
to
that
sort
of
thing
i
am
absolutely
certain
that
if
he
had
lost
a
thousand
roubles
in
notes
there
was
not
a
thief
in
the
prison
however
hardened
who
would
not
have
brought
them
to
him
if
the
man
lit
on
them
i
am
sure
of
it
how
the
prisoners
all
felt
for
him
and
with
him
when
they
learned
that
he
was
at
daggers
drawn
with
our
detested
major
that
came
about
a
month
after
his
arrival
their
delight
knew
no
bounds
the
major
had
formerly
served
with
him
in
the
same
detachment
so
when
they
met
after
a
long
separation
they
were
at
first
boon
companions
but
the
intimacy
could
not
and
did
not
last
they
came
to
blows
figuratively
and
g
kof
became
the
major
sworn
enemy
some
would
have
it
that
it
was
than
figuratively
that
they
came
to
actual
fisticuffs
a
likely
thing
enough
as
far
as
the
major
was
concerned
for
the
man
had
no
objection
to
a
scrimmage
when
the
convicts
heard
of
the
quarrel
they
really
could
not
contain
their
delight
old
and
the
commandant
get
on
finely
together
an
eagle
but
the
other
a
those
who
believed
in
the
fight
were
mighty
curious
to
know
which
of
the
two
had
had
the
worst
of
it
and
got
a
good
drubbing
if
it
had
been
proved
there
had
been
no
fighting
our
convicts
i
think
would
have
been
bitterly
disappointed
the
commandant
gave
him
fits
you
may
bet
your
life
on
it
said
they
he
a
little
but
as
bold
as
a
lion
the
other
one
got
into
a
blue
funk
and
hid
under
the
bed
from
him
but
g
kof
went
away
only
too
soon
and
keenly
was
he
regretted
in
the
prison
our
engineers
were
all
most
excellent
fellows
we
had
three
or
four
fresh
batches
of
them
while
i
was
there
our
eagles
never
remain
very
long
with
us
said
the
prisoners
especially
when
they
are
good
and
kind
fellows
it
was
this
g
kof
who
sent
b
ski
and
myself
to
work
in
his
bureau
for
he
was
partial
to
exiled
nobles
when
he
left
our
condition
was
still
fairly
endurable
for
there
was
another
engineer
there
who
showed
us
much
sympathy
and
friendship
we
copied
reports
for
some
time
and
our
handwriting
was
getting
to
be
very
good
when
an
order
came
from
the
authorities
that
we
were
to
be
sent
back
to
hard
labour
as
before
some
spiteful
person
had
been
at
work
at
bottom
we
were
rather
pleased
for
we
were
quite
tired
of
copying
for
two
whole
years
i
worked
in
company
with
b
ski
all
the
time
in
the
shops
and
many
a
gossip
did
we
have
about
our
hopes
for
the
future
and
our
notions
and
convictions
good
b
ski
had
a
very
odd
mind
which
worked
in
a
strange
exceptional
way
there
are
some
people
of
great
intelligence
who
indulge
in
paradox
unconscionably
but
when
they
have
undergone
great
and
constant
sufferings
for
their
ideas
and
made
great
sacrifices
for
them
you
ca
drive
their
notions
out
of
their
heads
and
it
is
cruel
to
try
it
when
you
objected
something
to
b
propositions
he
was
really
hurt
and
gave
you
a
violent
answer
he
was
perhaps
more
in
the
right
than
i
was
as
to
some
things
wherein
we
differed
but
we
were
obliged
to
give
one
another
up
very
much
to
my
regret
for
we
had
many
thoughts
in
common
as
years
went
on
m
tski
became
more
and
more
sombre
and
melancholy
he
became
a
prey
to
despair
during
the
earliest
part
of
my
imprisonment
he
was
communicative
enough
and
let
us
see
what
was
going
on
in
him
when
i
arrived
at
the
prison
he
had
just
finished
his
second
year
at
first
he
took
a
lively
interest
in
the
news
i
brought
for
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
outer
world
he
put
questions
to
me
listened
eagerly
showed
emotion
but
bit
by
bit
his
reserve
grew
on
him
and
there
was
no
getting
at
his
thoughts
the
glowing
coals
were
all
covered
up
with
ashes
yet
it
was
plain
that
his
temper
grew
sourer
and
sourer
hais
ces
he
would
say
speaking
of
convicts
i
had
got
to
know
something
of
i
never
could
make
him
see
any
good
in
them
he
really
did
not
seem
to
fully
enter
into
the
meaning
of
anything
i
said
on
their
behalf
though
he
would
sometimes
seem
to
agree
in
a
listless
sort
of
way
next
day
it
was
just
as
before
hais
ces
we
used
often
to
speak
french
with
him
so
one
of
the
overseers
of
the
works
the
soldier
dranichnikof
used
always
to
call
us
god
knows
why
m
tski
never
seemed
to
shake
off
his
usual
apathy
except
when
he
spoke
of
his
mother
she
is
old
and
infirm
he
said
she
loves
me
better
than
anything
in
the
world
and
i
do
even
know
if
she
still
living
if
she
learns
that
i
been
whipped
m
tski
was
not
a
noble
and
had
been
whipped
before
he
was
transported
when
the
recollection
of
this
came
up
in
his
mind
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
could
not
look
anybody
in
the
face
in
the
latest
days
of
his
imprisonment
he
used
to
walk
to
and
fro
quite
alone
for
the
most
part
one
day
at
noon
he
was
summoned
to
the
governor
who
received
him
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
well
m
tski
what
were
your
dreams
last
night
asked
the
governor
said
m
tski
to
me
later
when
he
said
that
to
me
a
shudder
ran
through
me
i
felt
struck
at
the
heart
his
answer
was
i
dreamed
that
i
had
a
letter
from
my
mother
better
than
that
better
replied
the
governor
you
are
free
your
mother
has
petitioned
the
emperor
and
he
has
granted
her
prayer
here
here
her
letter
and
the
order
for
your
dismissal
you
are
to
leave
the
jail
without
delay
he
came
to
us
pale
scarcely
able
to
believe
in
his
good
fortune
we
congratulated
him
he
pressed
our
hands
with
his
own
which
were
quite
cold
and
trembled
violently
many
of
the
convicts
wished
him
joy
they
were
really
glad
to
see
his
happiness
he
settled
in
siberia
establishing
himself
in
our
town
where
a
little
after
that
they
gave
him
a
place
he
used
often
to
come
to
the
jail
to
bring
us
news
and
tell
us
all
that
was
going
on
as
often
as
he
could
talk
with
us
it
was
political
news
that
interested
him
chiefly
besides
the
four
poles
the
political
convicts
of
whom
i
spoke
just
now
there
were
two
others
of
that
nation
who
were
sentenced
for
very
short
periods
they
had
not
much
education
but
were
good
simple
straightforward
fellows
there
was
another
a
tchoukooski
quite
a
colourless
person
one
more
i
must
mention
b
in
a
man
well
on
in
years
who
impressed
us
all
very
unfavourably
indeed
i
do
know
what
he
had
been
sentenced
for
although
he
used
to
tell
us
some
story
or
other
about
it
pretty
frequently
he
was
a
person
of
a
vulgar
mean
type
with
the
coarse
manner
of
an
enriched
shopkeeper
he
was
quite
without
education
and
seemed
to
take
interest
in
nothing
except
what
concerned
his
trade
which
was
that
of
a
painter
a
sort
of
he
was
he
showed
a
good
deal
of
talent
in
his
work
and
the
authorities
of
the
prison
soon
came
to
know
about
his
abilities
so
he
got
employment
all
through
the
town
in
decorating
walls
and
ceilings
in
two
years
he
beautified
the
rooms
of
nearly
all
the
prison
officials
who
remunerated
him
handsomely
so
he
lived
pretty
comfortably
he
was
sent
to
work
with
three
other
prisoners
two
of
whom
learned
the
business
thoroughly
one
of
these
t
jwoski
painted
nearly
as
well
as
b
in
himself
our
major
who
had
rooms
in
one
of
the
government
buildings
sent
for
b
in
and
gave
him
a
commission
to
decorate
the
walls
and
ceilings
there
which
he
did
so
effectively
that
the
suite
of
rooms
of
the
were
quite
put
out
of
countenance
by
those
of
the
major
the
house
itself
was
a
ramshackle
old
place
while
the
interior
thanks
to
b
in
was
as
gay
as
a
palace
our
worthy
major
was
hugely
delighted
went
about
rubbing
his
hands
and
told
everybody
that
he
should
look
out
for
a
wife
at
once
a
fellow
remain
single
when
he
lives
in
a
place
like
that
he
was
quite
serious
about
it
the
major
satisfaction
with
b
in
and
his
assistants
went
on
increasing
they
occupied
a
month
in
the
work
at
the
major
house
during
those
memorable
days
the
major
seemed
to
get
into
a
different
frame
of
mind
about
us
and
began
to
be
quite
kind
to
us
political
prisoners
one
day
he
sent
for
j
ski
j
ski
said
he
i
done
you
wrong
i
had
you
beaten
for
nothing
i
very
sorry
do
you
understand
i
very
sorry
i
major
j
ski
answered
that
he
understood
perfectly
do
you
understand
i
who
am
set
over
you
i
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
your
pardon
you
can
hardly
realise
it
i
suppose
what
are
you
to
me
fellow
a
worm
less
than
a
crawling
worm
you
a
convict
while
i
by
god
grace
am
a
major
major
you
understand
j
ski
answered
that
he
quite
well
understood
it
all
well
i
want
to
be
friends
with
you
but
can
you
appreciate
what
doing
can
you
feel
the
greatness
of
soul
i
showing
feel
and
appreciate
it
just
think
of
it
i
i
the
major
etc
etc
j
ski
told
me
of
this
scene
there
was
then
some
human
feeling
left
in
this
drunken
unruly
and
tormenting
brute
allowing
for
the
notions
of
things
and
feeble
faculties
one
can
not
deny
that
this
was
a
generous
proceeding
on
his
part
perhaps
he
was
a
little
less
drunk
than
usual
perhaps
more
who
can
tell
the
major
glorious
idea
of
marrying
came
to
nothing
the
rooms
got
all
their
bravery
but
the
wife
was
not
forthcoming
instead
of
going
to
the
altar
in
that
agreeable
way
he
was
pulled
up
before
the
authorities
and
sent
to
trial
he
received
orders
to
send
in
his
resignation
some
of
his
old
sins
had
found
him
out
it
seems
things
done
when
he
had
been
superintendent
of
police
in
our
town
this
crushing
blow
came
down
upon
him
without
notice
quite
suddenly
all
the
convicts
were
greatly
rejoiced
when
they
heard
the
great
news
it
was
high
day
and
holiday
all
through
the
jail
the
story
went
abroad
that
the
major
sobbed
and
cried
and
howled
like
an
old
woman
but
he
was
helpless
in
the
matter
he
was
obliged
to
leave
his
place
sell
his
two
gray
horses
and
everything
he
had
in
the
world
and
he
fell
into
complete
destitution
we
came
across
him
occasionally
afterwards
in
civilian
threadbare
clothes
and
wearing
a
cap
with
a
cockade
he
glanced
at
us
convicts
as
spitefully
and
maliciously
as
you
please
but
without
his
uniform
all
the
man
glory
was
gone
while
placed
over
us
he
gave
himself
the
airs
of
a
being
higher
than
human
who
had
got
into
coat
and
breeches
now
it
was
all
over
he
looked
like
the
lackey
he
was
and
a
disgraced
lackey
to
boot
with
fellows
of
this
sort
the
uniform
is
the
only
saving
grace
that
gone
all
gone
footnotes
the
decembrists

in

original

our
major
was
not
the
only
officer
who
spoke
of
himself
in
that
lofty
way
a

officers
did

same

who
had
risen
from
the
ranks
chiefly
chapter
ix
the
escape
a
little
while
after
the
major
resigned
our
prison
was
subjected
to
a
thorough
reorganization
the
hard
labour
hitherto
inflicted
and
the
other
regulations
were
abolished
and
the
place
put
upon
the
footing
of
the
military
convict
establishments
of
russia
as
a
result
of
this
prisoners
of
the
second
category
were
no
longer
sent
there
this
class
was
for
the
future
to
be
composed
of
prisoners
who
were
regarded
as
still
on
the
military
footing
that
is
to
say
men
who
in
spite
of
sentence
did
not
forfeit
for
ever
their
civic
they
were
soldiers
still
but
had
undergone
corporal
punishment
they
were
sentenced
for
comparatively
short
periods
six
years
at
most
when
they
had
served
their
time
or
in
case
of
pardon
they
went
into
the
ranks
again
as
before
men
guilty
of
a
second
offence
were
sentenced
to
twenty
years
of
imprisonment
up
to
the
time
i
speak
of
we
had
a
section
of
among
us
but
only
because
they
did
not
know
where
else
to
dispose
of
them
now
the
place
was
to
be
occupied
by
soldiers
exclusively
as
to
the
civilian
convicts
who
were
stripped
of
all
civic
rights
branded
cropped
and
shaven
these
were
to
remain
in
the
fortress
to
finish
their
time
but
as
no
fresh
prisoners
of
this
class
were
to
come
in
and
those
there
would
get
their
discharge
successively
at
the
end
of
ten
years
there
would
be
no
civilian
convicts
left
in
the
place
according
to
the
arrangements
the
line
of
division
between
the
classes
of
prisoners
there
was
maintained
from
time
to
time
there
came
in
other
military
criminals
of
high
position
sent
to
our
place
for
security
before
being
forwarded
to
eastern
siberia
for
the
more
aggravated
penalties
that
awaited
them
there
there
was
no
change
in
our
general
way
of
life
the
work
we
had
to
do
and
the
discipline
observed
were
the
same
as
before
but
the
administrative
system
was
entirely
altered
and
made
more
complex
an
officer
commandant
of
companies
was
assigned
to
be
at
the
head
of
the
prison
he
had
under
his
orders
four
subaltern
officers
who
mounted
guard
by
turns
the
invalids
were
superseded
by
twelve
officers
and
an
arsenal
superintendent
the
convicts
were
divided
into
sections
of
ten
and
corporals
chosen
among
them
the
power
of
these
over
the
others
was
as
may
be
supposed
nominal
as
might
be
expected
akim
akimitch
got
this
promotion
all
these
new
arrangements
were
confided
to
the
governor
to
carry
out
who
remained
in
superior
command
over
the
whole
establishment
the
changes
did
not
go
further
than
this
at
first
the
convicts
were
not
a
little
excited
by
this
movement
and
discussed
their
new
guardians
a
good
deal
among
themselves
trying
to
make
out
what
sort
of
fellows
they
were
but
when
they
saw
that
everything
went
on
pretty
much
as
usual
they
quieted
down
and
things
resumed
their
ordinary
course
we
had
got
rid
of
the
major
and
that
was
something
everybody
took
fresh
breath
and
fresh
courage
the
fear
that
was
in
all
hearts
grew
less
we
had
some
assurance
that
in
case
of
need
we
could
go
to
our
superiors
and
lodge
our
complaint
and
that
a
man
could
not
be
punished
without
cause
and
would
not
unless
by
mistake
brandy
was
brought
in
as
before
although
we
had
subaltern
officers
now
where
invalids
were
before
these
subalterns
were
all
worthy
careful
men
who
knew
their
place
and
business
there
were
some
among
them
who
had
the
idea
that
they
might
give
themselves
grand
airs
and
treat
us
like
common
soldiers
but
they
soon
gave
it
up
and
behaved
like
the
others
those
who
did
not
seem
to
be
well
able
to
get
into
their
heads
what
the
ways
of
our
prison
really
were
had
sharp
lessons
about
it
from
the
convicts
themselves
which
led
to
some
lively
scenes
one
was
confronted
with
brandy
which
was
of
course
too
much
for
him
when
he
was
sober
again
we
had
a
little
explanation
with
him
we
pointed
out
that
he
had
been
drinking
with
the
prisoners
and
that
accordingly
etc
etc
he
became
quite
tractable
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
subalterns
closed
their
eyes
to
the
brandy
business
they
went
to
market
for
us
just
as
the
invalids
used
to
and
brought
the
prisoners
white
bread
meat
anything
that
could
be
got
in
without
too
much
risk
so
i
never
could
understand
why
they
had
gone
to
the
trouble
of
turning
the
place
into
a
military
prison
the
change
was
made
two
years
before
i
left
the
place
i
had
two
years
to
bear
of
it
still
i
see
little
use
in
recording
all
i
saw
and
went
through
later
at
the
convict
establishment
day
by
day
if
i
were
to
tell
it
all
all
the
daily
and
hourly
occurrences
i
might
write
twice
or
thrice
as
many
chapters
as
this
book
ought
to
contain
but
i
should
simply
tire
the
reader
and
myself
substantially
all
that
i
might
write
has
been
already
embodied
in
the
narrative
as
it
stands
so
far
and
the
reader
has
had
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
tolerable
idea
of
what
the
life
of
a
convict
of
the
second
class
really
was
my
wish
has
been
to
portray
the
state
of
things
at
the
establishment
and
as
it
affected
myself
accurately
and
yet
forcibly
whether
i
have
done
so
others
must
judge
i
can
not
pronounce
upon
my
own
work
but
i
think
i
may
well
draw
it
to
a
close
as
i
move
among
these
recollections
of
a
dreadful
past
the
old
suffering
comes
up
again
and
all
but
strangles
me
besides
i
can
not
be
sure
of
my
memory
as
to
all
i
saw
in
these
last
years
for
the
faculty
seems
blunted
as
regards
the
later
compared
with
the
earlier
period
of
my
imprisonment
there
is
a
good
deal
i
am
sure
i
have
quite
forgotten
but
i
remember
only
too
well
how
very
very
slow
these
last
two
years
were
how
very
sad
how
the
days
seemed
as
if
they
never
would
come
to
evening
something
like
water
falling
drop
by
drop
i
remember
too
that
i
was
filled
with
a
mighty
longing
for
my
resurrection
from
that
grave
which
gave
me
strength
to
bear
up
to
wait
and
to
hope
and
so
i
got
to
be
hardened
and
enduring
i
lived
on
expectation
i
counted
every
passing
day
if
there
were
a
thousand
more
of
them
to
pass
at
the
prison
i
found
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
one
of
them
was
gone
and
only
nine
hundred
and
to
come
i
remember
too
that
though
i
had
round
me
a
hundred
persons
in
like
case
i
felt
myself
more
and
more
solitary
and
though
the
solitude
was
awful
i
came
to
love
it
isolated
thus
among
the
i
went
over
all
my
earlier
life
analysing
its
events
and
thoughts
minutely
i
passed
my
former
doings
in
review
and
sometimes
was
pitiless
in
condemnation
of
myself
sometimes
i
went
so
far
as
to
be
grateful
to
fate
for
the
privilege
of
such
loneliness
for
only
that
could
have
caused
me
so
severely
to
scrutinise
my
past
so
searchingly
to
examine
its
inner
and
outer
life
what
strong
and
strange
new
germs
of
hope
came
in
those
memorable
hours
up
in
my
soul
i
weighed
and
decided
all
sorts
of
issues
i
entered
into
a
compact
with
myself
to
avoid
the
errors
of
former
years
and
the
rocks
on
which
i
had
been
wrecked
i
laid
down
a
programme
for
my
future
and
vowed
that
i
would
stick
to
it
i
had
a
sort
of
blind
and
complete
conviction
that
once
away
from
that
place
i
should
be
able
to
carry
out
everything
i
made
my
mind
up
to
i
looked
for
my
freedom
with
transports
of
eager
desire
i
wanted
to
try
my
strength
in
a
renewed
struggle
with
life
sometimes
i
was
clutched
as
by
fangs
by
an
impatience
which
rose
to
fever
heat
it
is
painful
to
go
back
to
these
things
most
painful
nobody
i
know
can
care
much
about
it
at
all
except
myself
but
i
write
because
i
think
people
will
understand
and
because
there
are
those
who
have
been
those
who
yet
will
be
like
myself
condemned
imprisoned
cut
off
from
life
in
the
flower
of
their
age
and
in
the
full
possession
of
all
their
strength
but
all
this
is
useless
let
me
end
my
memoirs
with
a
narrative
of
something
interesting
for
i
must
not
close
them
too
abruptly
what
shall
it
be
well
it
may
occur
to
some
to
ask
whether
it
was
quite
impossible
to
escape
from
the
jail
and
if
during
the
time
i
spent
there
no
attempt
of
the
kind
was
made
i
have
already
said
that
a
prisoner
who
has
got
through
two
or
three
years
thinks
a
good
deal
of
it
and
as
a
rule
concludes
that
it
is
best
to
finish
his
time
without
running
more
risks
so
that
he
may
get
his
settlement
on
the
land
or
otherwise
when
set
at
liberty
but
those
who
reckon
in
this
way
are
convicts
sentenced
for
comparatively
short
times
those
who
have
many
years
to
serve
are
always
ready
to
run
some
chances
for
all
that
the
attempts
at
escape
were
quite
infrequent
whether
that
was
attributable
to
the
want
of
spirit
in
the
convicts
the
severity
of
the
military
discipline
enforced
or
after
all
to
the
situation
of
the
town
little
favourable
to
escapes
for
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
open
steppe
i
really
can
not
say
all
these
motives
no
doubt
contributed
to
give
pause
it
was
difficult
enough
to
get
out
of
the
prison
at
all
in
my
time
two
convicts
tried
it
they
were
criminals
of
importance
when
our
major
had
been
got
rid
of
a
v
the
spy
was
quite
alone
with
nobody
to
back
him
up
he
was
still
quite
young
but
his
character
grew
in
force
with
every
year
he
was
a
bold
fellow
of
considerable
intelligence
i
think
if
they
had
set
him
at
liberty
he
would
have
gone
on
spying
and
getting
money
in
every
sort
of
shameful
way
but
i
do
think
he
would
have
let
himself
be
caught
again
he
would
have
turned
his
experiences
as
a
convict
to
far
too
much
good
for
that
one
trick
he
practised
was
that
of
forging
passports
at
least
so
i
heard
from
some
of
the
convicts
i
think
this
fellow
was
ready
to
risk
everything
for
a
change
in
his
position
circumstances
gave
me
the
opportunity
of
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
man
disposition
and
seeing
how
ugly
it
was
he
was
simply
revolting
in
his
cold
deep
wickedness
and
my
disgust
with
him
was
more
than
i
could
get
over
i
do
believe
that
if
he
wanted
a
drink
of
brandy
and
could
only
have
got
it
by
killing
some
one
he
would
not
have
hesitated
one
moment
if
it
was
pretty
certain
the
crime
would
not
come
out
he
had
learned
there
in
that
jail
to
look
on
everything
in
the
coolest
calculating
way
it
was
on
him
that
the
choice
of
koulikoff
of
the
special
section
fell
as
we
are
to
see
i
have
spoken
before
of
koulikoff
he
was
no
longer
young
but
full
of
ardour
life
and
vigour
and
endowed
with
extraordinary
faculties
he
felt
his
strength
and
wanted
still
to
have
a
life
of
his
own
there
are
some
men
who
long
to
live
in
a
rich
abounding
life
even
when
old
age
has
got
hold
of
them
i
should
have
been
a
good
deal
surprised
if
koulikoff
had
tried
to
escape
but
he
did
which
of
the
two
koulikoff
and
a
v
had
the
greater
influence
over
the
other
i
really
can
not
say
they
were
a
goodly
couple
and
suited
each
other
to
a
hair
so
they
soon
became
as
thick
as
possible
i
fancy
that
koulikoff
reckoned
on
a
v
to
forge
a
passport
for
him
besides
the
latter
was
of
the
noble
class
belonged
to
good
society
a
circumstance
out
of
which
a
good
deal
could
be
made
if
they
managed
to
get
back
into
russia
heaven
only
knows
what
compacts
they
made
or
what
plans
and
hopes
they
formed
if
they
got
as
far
as
russia
they
would
at
all
events
leave
behind
them
siberia
and
vagabondage
koulikoff
was
a
versatile
man
capable
of
playing
many
a
part
on
the
stage
of
life
and
had
plenty
of
ability
to
go
upon
whatever
direction
his
efforts
took
to
such
persons
the
jail
is
strangulation
and
suffocation
so
the
two
set
about
plotting
their
escape
but
to
get
away
without
a
soldier
to
act
as
escort
was
impossible
so
a
soldier
had
to
be
won
in
one
of
the
battalions
stationed
at
our
fortress
was
a
pole
of
middle
life
an
energetic
fellow
worthy
of
a
better
fate
serious
courageous
when
he
arrived
first
in
siberia
quite
young
he
had
deserted
for
he
could
not
stand
his
sufferings
from
nostalgia
he
was
captured
and
whipped
during
two
years
he
formed
part
of
the
disciplinary
companies
to
which
offenders
are
sent
then
he
rejoined
his
battalion
and
showing
himself
zealous
in
the
service
had
been
rewarded
by
promotion
to
the
rank
of
corporal
he
had
a
good
deal
of
and
spoke
like
a
man
who
had
no
small
conceit
of
himself
i
took
particular
notice
of
the
man
sometimes
when
he
was
among
the
soldiers
who
had
charge
of
us
for
the
poles
had
spoken
to
me
about
him
and
i
got
the
idea
that
his
longing
for
his
native
country
had
taken
the
form
of
a
chill
fixed
deadly
hatred
for
those
who
kept
him
away
from
it
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
stick
at
nothing
and
koulikoff
showed
that
his
scent
was
good
when
he
pitched
on
this
man
to
be
an
accomplice
in
his
flight
this
corporal
name
was
kohler
koulikoff
and
he
settled
their
plans
and
fixed
the
day
it
was
the
month
of
june
the
hottest
of
the
year
the
climate
of
our
town
and
neighbourhood
was
pretty
equable
especially
in
summer
which
is
a
very
good
thing
for
tramps
and
vagabonds
to
make
off
far
after
leaving
the
fortress
was
quite
out
of
the
question
it
being
situated
on
rising
ground
and
in
uncovered
country
for
though
surrounded
by
woods
these
are
a
considerable
distance
away
a
disguise
was
indispensable
and
to
procure
it
they
must
manage
to
get
into
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
koulikoff
had
taken
care
some
time
before
to
prepare
a
den
of
some
sort
i
do
know
whether
his
worthy
friends
in
that
part
of
the
town
were
in
the
secret
it
may
be
presumed
they
were
though
there
is
no
evidence
that
year
however
a
young
woman
who
led
a
gay
life
and
was
very
pretty
settled
down
in
a
nook
of
that
same
part
of
the
city
near
the
county
this
young
person
attracted
a
good
deal
of
notice
and
her
career
promised
to
be
something
quite
remarkable
her
nickname
was
fire
and
flame
i
think
that
she
and
the
fugitives
concerted
the
plans
of
escape
together
for
koulikoff
had
lavished
a
good
deal
of
attention
and
money
on
her
for
more
than
a
year
when
the
gangs
were
formed
each
morning
the
two
fellows
koulikoff
and
a
v
managed
to
get
themselves
sent
out
with
the
convict
chilkin
whose
trade
was
that
of
and
plasterer
to
do
up
the
empty
barracks
when
the
soldiers
went
into
camp
a
v
and
koulikoff
were
to
help
in
carrying
the
necessary
materials
kohler
got
himself
put
into
the
escort
on
the
occasion
as
the
rules
required
three
soldiers
to
act
as
escort
for
two
prisoners
they
gave
him
a
young
recruit
whom
he
was
doing
corporal
duty
upon
drilling
and
training
him
our
fugitives
must
have
exercised
a
great
deal
of
influence
over
kohler
to
deceive
him
to
cast
his
lot
in
with
them
serious
intelligent
and
reflective
man
as
he
was
with
so
few
more
years
of
service
to
pass
in
the
army
they
arrived
at
the
barracks
about
six
in
the
morning
there
was
nobody
with
them
after
having
worked
about
an
hour
koulikoff
and
a
v
told
chilkin
that
they
were
going
to
the
workshop
to
see
some
one
and
fetch
a
tool
they
wanted
they
had
to
go
carefully
to
work
with
chilkin
and
speak
in
as
natural
a
tone
as
they
could
the
man
was
from
moscow
by
trade
a
sharp
and
cunning
not
talkative
fragile
in
appearance
with
little
flesh
on
his
bones
he
was
the
sort
of
person
who
might
have
been
expected
to
pass
his
life
in
honest
working
dress
in
some
moscow
shop
yet
here
he
was
in
the
special
section
after
many
wanderings
and
transfers
among
the
most
formidable
military
criminals
so
fate
had
ordered
what
had
he
done
to
deserve
such
severe
punishment
i
had
not
the
least
idea
he
never
showed
the
least
resentment
or
sour
feeling
and
went
on
in
a
quiet
inoffensive
way
now
and
then
he
got
as
drunk
as
a
lord
but
apart
from
that
his
conduct
was
perfectly
good
of
course
he
was
not
in
the
secret
so
he
had
to
be
thrown
off
the
scent
koulikoff
told
him
with
a
wink
that
they
were
going
to
get
some
brandy
which
had
been
hidden
the
day
before
in
the
workshop
which
suited
chilkin
book
perfectly
he
had
not
the
least
notion
of
what
was
up
and
remained
alone
with
the
young
recruit
while
koulikoff
a
v
and
kohler
betook
themselves
to
the
suburbs
of
the
town
passed
the
men
did
not
come
back
chilkin
began
to
think
and
the
truth
dawned
upon
him
he
remembered
that
koulikoff
had
not
seemed
at
all
like
himself
that
he
had
seen
him
whispering
and
winking
to
a
v
he
was
sure
of
that
and
the
whole
thing
seemed
suspicious
to
him
kohler
behaviour
had
struck
him
too
when
he
went
off
with
the
two
convicts
the
corporal
had
given
the
recruit
orders
what
he
was
to
do
in
his
absence
which
he
had
never
known
him
do
before
the
more
chilkin
thought
over
the
matter
the
less
he
liked
it
time
went
on
the
convicts
did
not
return
his
anxiety
was
great
for
he
saw
that
the
authorities
would
suspect
him
of
connivance
with
the
fugitives
so
that
his
own
skin
was
in
danger
if
he
made
any
delay
in
giving
information
of
what
had
occurred
suspicion
of
himself
would
grow
into
conviction
that
he
knew
what
the
men
intended
when
they
left
him
and
he
would
be
dealt
with
as
their
accomplice
there
was
no
time
to
lose
it
came
into
his
mind
then
that
koulikoff
and
a
v
had
become
markedly
intimate
for
some
time
and
that
they
had
been
often
seen
laying
their
heads
together
behind
the
barracks
by
themselves
he
remembered
too
that
he
had
more
than
once
fancied
that
they
were
up
to
something
together
he
looked
attentively
at
the
soldier
with
him
as
escort
the
fellow
was
yawning
leaning
on
his
gun
and
scratching
his
nose
in
the
most
innocent
manner
imaginable
so
chilkin
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
speak
of
his
anxieties
to
this
man
he
told
him
simply
to
come
with
him
to
the
engineers
workshops
his
object
was
to
ask
if
anybody
there
had
seen
his
companions
but
nobody
there
had
so
chilkin
suspicions
grew
stronger
and
stronger
if
only
he
could
think
that
they
had
gone
to
get
drunk
and
have
a
spree
in
the
outskirts
of
the
town
as
koulikoff
often
did
no
thought
chilkin
that
was
so
they
would
have
told
him
for
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
mystery
of
that
chilkin
left
his
work
and
went
straight
back
to
the
jail
it
was
about
nine
when
he
reached
the
to
whom
he
mentioned
his
suspicions
that
officer
was
frightened
and
at
first
could
not
believe
there
was
anything
in
it
all
chilkin
had
in
fact
expressed
no
more
than
a
vague
misgiving
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
the
ran
to
the
major
who
in
his
turn
ran
to
the
governor
in
a
all
necessary
measures
were
taken
the
was
communicated
with
as
the
convicts
in
question
were
persons
of
importance
it
might
be
expected
that
the
matter
would
be
seriously
viewed
at
petersburg
a
v
was
classed
among
political
prisoners
by
a
somewhat
random
official
proceeding
it
would
seem
koulikoff
was
a
convict
of
the
special
section
that
is
to
say
as
a
criminal
of
the
blackest
dye
and
what
was
worse
was
an
it
was
then
brought
to
notice
that
according
to
the
regulations
each
convict
of
the
special
section
ought
to
have
two
soldiers
assigned
as
escort
when
he
went
to
work
the
regulations
had
not
been
observed
as
to
this
so
that
everybody
was
exposed
to
serious
trouble
expresses
were
sent
off
to
all
the
district
offices
of
the
municipality
and
all
the
little
neighbouring
towns
to
warn
the
authorities
of
the
escape
of
the
two
convicts
and
a
full
description
furnished
of
their
persons
cossacks
were
sent
out
to
hunt
them
up
letters
sent
to
the
authorities
of
all
adjoining
governmental
districts
and
everybody
was
frightened
to
death
the
excitement
was
quite
as
great
all
through
the
prison
as
the
convicts
returned
from
work
they
heard
the
tremendous
news
which
spread
rapidly
from
man
to
man
all
received
it
with
deep
though
secret
satisfaction
their
emotion
was
as
natural
as
it
was
great
the
affair
broke
the
monotony
of
their
lives
and
gave
them
something
to
think
of
but
above
all
it
was
an
escape
and
as
such
something
to
sympathise
with
deeply
and
stirred
fibres
in
the
poor
fellows
which
had
long
been
without
any
exciting
stimulus
something
like
hope
and
a
disposition
to
confront
their
fate
set
their
hearts
beating
for
the
incident
seemed
to
show
that
their
hard
lot
was
not
hopelessly
unchangeable
well
you
see
they
got
off
in
spite
of
them
why
should
we
the
thought
came
into
every
man
mind
and
made
him
stiffen
his
back
and
look
at
his
neighbours
in
a
defiant
sort
of
way
all
the
convicts
seemed
to
grow
an
inch
taller
on
the
strength
of
it
and
to
look
down
a
bit
upon
the
the
heads
of
the
place
soon
came
running
up
as
you
may
imagine
the
governor
now
arrived
in
person
we
fellows
looked
at
them
all
with
some
assurance
with
a
touch
of
contempt
and
with
a
very
set
expression
of
face
as
though
to
say
well
you
there
we
can
get
out
of
your
clutches
when
we
a
mind
to
all
the
men
were
quite
sure
there
would
be
a
general
searching
of
everything
and
everybody
so
everything
that
was
at
all
contraband
was
carefully
hidden
for
the
authorities
would
want
to
show
that
precious
wisdom
of
theirs
which
may
be
reckoned
on
after
the
event
the
expectation
was
verified
there
was
a
mighty
turning
of
everything
upside
down
and
a
general
rummage
with
the
discovery
of
exactly
nothing
as
they
might
have
known
when
the
time
came
for
going
out
to
work
after
dinner
the
usual
escorts
were
doubled
when
night
came
the
officers
and
on
service
came
pouncing
on
us
at
every
moment
to
see
if
we
were
off
our
guard
and
if
anything
could
be
got
out
of
us
the
lists
were
gone
over
once
more
than
the
usual
number
of
times
which
extra
mustering
only
gave
more
trouble
for
nothing
we
were
hunted
out
of
the
that
our
names
might
be
gone
through
again
then
when
in
barrack
they
reckoned
us
up
another
time
as
if
they
never
could
be
done
with
the
exercise
the
convicts
were
not
at
all
disturbed
by
all
this
bustling
absurdity
they
put
on
a
very
unconcerned
demeanour
and
as
is
always
the
case
in
such
a
conjuncture
behaved
in
the
prettiest
manner
all
that
evening
and
night
we
wo
give
them
any
handle
anyhow
was
the
general
feeling
the
question
with
the
authorities
was
whether
some
among
us
were
not
in
complicity
with
those
who
had
got
away
so
a
careful
watch
was
kept
over
our
doings
and
a
careful
ear
for
our
conversations
but
nothing
came
of
it
not
such
fools
those
fellows
as
to
leave
anybody
behind
who
was
in
the
secret
when
you
go
at
that
sort
of
thing
you
lie
low
and
play
low
koulikoff
and
a
v
know
enough
to
have
covered
up
their
tracks
done
the
trick
in
style
keeping
things
to
themselves
they
mizzled
the
rascals
clever
chaps
those
they
could
get
through
shut
doors
the
glory
of
koulikoff
and
a
v
had
grown
a
hundred
cubits
higher
than
it
was
everybody
was
proud
of
them
their
exploit
it
was
felt
would
be
handed
down
to
the
most
distant
posterity
and
outlive
the
jail
itself
rattling
fellows
those
said
one
ca
get
away
from
here
eh
their
notion
is
it
just
look
at
those
chaps
yes
said
a
third
looking
very
superior
but
who
it
that
has
got
away
fellows
ca
hold
a
candle
to
them
at
any
other
time
the
man
to
whom
anything
of
that
sort
was
said
would
have
replied
angrily
enough
and
defended
himself
now
the
observation
was
met
with
modest
silence
true
enough
was
said
everybody
not
a
koulikoff
or
an
a
v
got
to
show
what
you
made
of
before
you
a
right
to
speak
i
say
pals
after
all
why
do
we
remain
in
the
place
struck
in
a
prisoner
seated
by
the
kitchen
window
he
spoke
drawlingly
but
the
man
you
could
see
enjoyed
it
all
he
slowly
rubbed
his
cheek
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
why
do
we
stop
it
no
life
at
all
we
been
buried
though
we
alive
and
kicking
now
it
so
oh
curse
it
you
ca
get
out
of
prison
as
easy
as
shaking
off
an
old
boot
i
tell
you
it
sticks
to
your
calves
what
the
good
of
pulling
a
long
face
over
it
but
look
here
there
is
koulikoff
now
began
one
of
the
most
eager
a
mere
lad
koulikoff
exclaimed
another
looking
askance
at
the
young
fellow
koulikoff
they
do
turn
out
koulikoffs
by
the
dozen
and
a
v
pals
there
a
lad
for
you
aye
aye
he
get
koulikoff
just
where
he
wants
him
as
often
as
he
wants
him
he
up
to
everything
he
is
i
wonder
how
far
they
got
that
what
want
to
know
said
one
then
the
talk
went
off
into
details
had
they
got
far
from
the
town
what
direction
did
they
go
off
in
gave
them
the
best
chance
then
they
discussed
distances
and
as
there
were
convicts
who
knew
the
neighbourhood
well
these
were
attentively
listened
to
next
they
talked
over
the
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
villages
of
whom
they
seemed
to
think
as
badly
as
possible
there
was
nobody
in
the
neighbourhood
the
convicts
believed
who
would
hesitate
at
all
as
to
the
course
to
be
pursued
nothing
would
induce
them
to
help
the
runaways
quite
the
other
way
these
people
would
hunt
them
down
if
you
only
knew
what
bad
fellows
these
peasants
are
rascally
brutes
peasants
indeed
worthless
scamps
these
siberians
are
as
bad
as
bad
can
be
they
think
nothing
of
killing
a
man
oh
well
our
fellows
yes
that
it
they
may
come
off
second
best
our
fellows
are
as
plucky
as
plucky
can
be
well
if
we
live
long
enough
we
shall
hear
something
about
them
soon
well
now
what
do
you
do
you
think
they
really
will
get
clean
away
i
am
sure
as
i
live
that
they
never
be
caught
said
one
of
the
most
excited
giving
the
table
a
great
blow
with
his
fist
hm
that
as
things
turn
out
i
tell
you
what
friends
said
skouratof
if
i
once
got
out
stake
my
life
they
never
get
me
again
everybody
burst
out
laughing
they
would
hardly
condescend
to
listen
to
him
but
skouratof
was
not
to
be
put
down
i
tell
you
i
stake
my
life
on
it
with
great
energy
why
i
made
my
mind
up
to
long
ago
i
find
means
of
going
through
a
rather
than
let
them
lay
hands
on
me
oh
do
you
fear
when
your
belly
got
empty
you
just
go
creeping
to
a
peasant
and
ask
him
for
a
morsel
of
something
fresh
laughter
i
ask
him
for
victuals
you
a
liar
hold
your
jaw
ca
you
we
know
what
you
were
sent
here
for
you
and
your
uncle
vacia
killed
some
peasant
for
bewitching
your
cattle
more
laughter
the
more
serious
among
them
seemed
very
angry
and
indignant
you
a
liar
cried
skouratof
it
mikitka
who
told
you
that
i
was
in
that
at
all
it
was
uncle
vacia
do
you
mix
my
name
up
in
it
i
a
moscow
man
and
i
been
on
the
tramp
ever
since
i
was
a
very
small
thing
look
here
when
the
priest
taught
me
to
read
the
liturgy
he
used
to
pinch
my
ears
and
say
this
after
me
have
pity
on
me
lord
out
of
thy
great
goodness
and
he
used
to
make
me
say
with
him
taken
me
up
and
brought
me
to
the
out
of
thy
great
goodness
and
the
like
i
tell
you
that
went
on
when
i
was
quite
a
little
fellow
all
laughed
heartily
again
that
was
what
skouratof
wanted
he
liked
playing
clown
soon
the
talk
became
serious
again
especially
among
the
older
men
and
those
who
knew
a
good
deal
about
escapes
those
among
the
younger
convicts
who
could
keep
themselves
quiet
enough
to
listen
seemed
highly
delighted
a
great
crowd
was
assembled
in
and
about
the
kitchen
there
were
none
of
the
warders
about
so
everybody
could
give
vent
to
his
feelings
in
talk
or
otherwise
one
man
i
noticed
who
was
particularly
enjoying
himself
a
tartar
a
little
fellow
with
high
and
a
remarkably
droll
face
his
name
was
mametka
he
could
scarcely
speak
russian
at
all
but
it
was
odd
to
see
the
way
he
craned
his
neck
forward
into
the
crowd
and
the
childish
delight
he
showed
well
mametka
my
lad
ouk
iakchi
said
mametka
as
well
as
he
could
shaking
his
grotesque
head
they
never
catch
them
eh
iok
and
mametka
waggled
his
head
and
threw
his
arms
about
you
a
liar
then
and
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
hey
that
it
that
it
answered
poor
mametka
all
right
good
it
is
skouratof
gave
him
a
thump
on
the
head
which
sent
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
and
went
out
in
high
glee
and
mametka
was
quite
chapfallen
for
a
week
or
so
a
very
tight
hand
was
kept
on
everybody
in
the
jail
and
the
whole
neighbourhood
was
repeatedly
and
carefully
searched
how
they
managed
it
i
can
not
tell
but
the
prisoners
always
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
measures
taken
by
the
authorities
for
recovering
the
runaways
for
some
days
according
to
all
we
heard
things
went
very
favourably
for
them
no
traces
whatever
of
them
could
be
found
our
convicts
made
very
light
of
all
the
authorities
were
about
and
were
quite
at
their
ease
about
their
friends
and
kept
saying
that
nothing
would
ever
be
found
out
about
them
all
the
peasants
round
about
were
roused
we
were
told
and
watching
all
the
likely
places
woods
ravines
etc
stuff
and
nonsense
said
our
fellows
who
had
a
grin
on
their
faces
most
of
the
time
they
hidden
at
somebody
place
who
a
friend
that
certain
they
not
the
fellows
to
chance
things
they
made
all
sure
the
general
idea
was
in
fact
that
they
were
still
concealed
in
the
suburbs
of
the
town
in
a
cellar
waiting
till
the
hue
and
cry
was
over
and
for
their
hair
to
grow
that
they
would
remain
there
perhaps
six
months
at
least
and
then
quietly
go
off
all
the
prisoners
were
in
the
most
fanciful
and
romantic
state
of
mind
about
the
things
suddenly
eight
days
after
the
escape
a
rumour
spread
that
the
authorities
were
on
their
track
this
rumour
was
at
first
treated
with
contempt
but
towards
evening
there
seemed
to
be
more
in
it
the
convicts
became
much
excited
next
morning
it
was
said
in
the
town
that
the
runaways
had
been
caught
and
were
being
brought
back
after
dinner
there
were
further
details
the
story
was
that
they
had
been
seized
at
a
hamlet
seventy
versts
away
from
the
town
at
last
we
had
fully
confirmed
tidings
the
positively
asserted
immediately
after
an
interview
with
the
major
that
they
would
be
brought
into
the
that
very
night
they
were
taken
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
it
is
difficult
to
convey
an
adequate
idea
of
the
way
the
convicts
were
affected
by
the
news
at
first
their
rage
was
great
then
they
were
deeply
dejected
then
they
began
to
be
bitter
and
sarcastic
pouring
all
their
scorn
not
on
the
authorities
but
on
the
runaways
who
had
been
such
fools
as
to
get
caught
a
few
began
this
then
nearly
all
joined
except
a
small
number
of
the
more
serious
thoughtful
ones
who
held
their
tongues
and
seemed
to
regard
the
thoughtless
fellows
with
great
contempt
poor
koulikoff
and
a
v
were
now
just
as
heartily
abused
as
they
had
been
glorified
before
the
men
seemed
to
take
a
delight
in
running
them
down
as
though
in
being
caught
they
had
done
something
wantonly
offensive
to
their
mates
it
was
said
with
high
contempt
that
the
fellows
had
probably
got
hungry
and
could
stand
it
and
had
gone
into
a
village
to
ask
bread
of
the
peasants
which
according
to
tramp
etiquette
it
appears
is
to
come
down
very
low
in
the
world
indeed
in
this
supposition
the
men
turned
out
to
be
quite
mistaken
for
what
had
happened
was
that
the
tracks
of
the
runaways
out
of
the
town
were
discovered
and
followed
up
they
were
ascertained
to
have
got
into
a
wood
which
was
surrounded
so
that
the
fugitives
had
no
recourse
but
to
give
themselves
up
they
were
brought
in
that
night
tied
hands
and
feet
under
armed
escort
all
the
convicts
ran
hastily
to
the
palisades
to
see
what
would
be
done
with
them
but
they
saw
nothing
except
the
carriages
of
the
governor
and
the
major
which
were
waiting
in
front
of
the
the
fugitives
were
ironed
and
locked
up
separately
their
punishment
being
adjourned
till
the
next
day
the
prisoners
began
all
to
sympathise
with
the
unhappy
fellows
when
they
heard
how
they
had
been
taken
and
learned
that
they
could
not
help
themselves
and
the
anxiety
about
the
issue
was
keen
they
get
a
thousand
at
least
a
thousand
is
it
i
tell
you
they
have
it
till
the
life
is
beaten
out
of
them
a
v
may
get
off
with
a
thousand
but
the
other
kill
why
he
in
the
section
they
were
wrong
a
v
was
sentenced
to
five
hundred
strokes
his
previous
good
conduct
told
in
his
favour
and
this
was
his
first
prison
offence
koulikoff
i
believe
had
fifteen
hundred
the
punishment
upon
the
whole
was
mild
rather
than
severe
the
two
men
showed
good
sense
and
feeling
for
they
gave
nobody
name
as
having
helped
them
and
positively
declared
that
they
had
made
straight
for
the
woods
without
going
into
anybody
house
i
was
very
sorry
for
koulikoff
to
say
nothing
of
the
heavy
beating
he
got
he
had
thrown
away
all
his
chances
of
having
his
lot
as
a
prisoner
lightened
later
he
was
sent
to
another
convict
establishment
a
v
did
not
get
all
he
was
sentenced
to
the
physicians
interfered
and
he
was
let
off
but
as
soon
as
he
was
safe
in
the
hospital
he
began
blowing
his
trumpet
again
and
said
he
would
stick
at
nothing
now
and
that
they
should
soon
see
what
he
would
do
koulikoff
was
not
changed
a
bit
as
decorous
as
ever
and
gave
himself
just
the
same
airs
as
ever
manner
or
words
to
show
that
he
had
had
such
an
adventure
but
the
convicts
looked
on
him
quite
differently
he
seemed
to
have
come
down
a
good
deal
in
their
estimation
and
now
to
be
on
their
own
level
every
way
instead
of
being
a
superior
creature
so
it
was
that
poor
koulikoff
star
paled
success
is
everything
in
this
world
footnote
the
expression
of
the
original
is
untranslatable
literally
you
killed
a
this
phrase
means
murder
of
a
peasant
male
or
female
supposed
to
bewitch
cattle
we
had
in
our
jail
a
murderer
who
had
done
this
dostoïeffsky
note
chapter
x
freedom
this
incident
occurred
during
my
last
year
of
imprisonment
my
recollection
of
what
occurred
this
last
year
is
as
keen
as
of
the
events
of
the
first
years
but
i
have
gone
into
detail
enough
in
spite
of
my
impatience
to
be
out
this
year
was
the
least
trying
of
all
the
years
i
spent
there
i
had
now
many
friends
and
acquaintances
among
the
convicts
who
had
by
this
time
made
up
their
minds
very
much
in
my
favour
many
of
them
indeed
had
come
to
feel
a
sincere
and
genuine
affection
for
me
the
soldier
who
was
assigned
to
accompany
my
friend
and
myself
simultaneously
discharged
out
of
the
prison
very
nearly
cried
when
the
time
for
leaving
came
and
when
we
were
at
last
in
full
freedom
staying
in
the
rooms
of
the
government
building
placed
at
our
disposal
for
the
month
we
still
spent
in
the
town
this
man
came
nearly
every
day
to
see
us
but
there
were
some
men
whom
i
could
never
soften
or
win
any
regard
from
god
knows
why
and
who
showed
just
the
same
hard
aversion
for
me
at
the
last
as
at
the
first
something
we
could
not
get
over
stood
between
us
i
had
more
indulgences
during
the
last
year
i
found
among
the
military
functionaries
of
our
town
old
acquaintances
and
even
some
old
schoolfellows
and
the
renewal
of
these
relations
helped
me
thanks
to
them
i
got
permission
to
have
some
money
to
write
to
my
family
and
even
to
have
some
books
for
some
years
i
had
not
had
a
single
volume
and
words
would
fail
to
tell
the
strange
deep
emotion
and
excitement
which
the
first
book
i
read
at
the
jail
caused
me
i
began
to
devour
it
at
night
when
the
doors
were
closed
and
read
it
till
the
break
of
day
it
was
a
number
of
a
review
and
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
messenger
from
the
other
world
as
i
read
my
life
before
the
prison
days
seemed
to
rise
up
before
me
in
sharp
definition
as
of
some
existence
independent
of
my
own
which
another
soul
had
had
then
i
tried
to
get
some
clear
idea
of
my
relation
to
current
events
and
things
whether
my
arrears
of
knowledge
and
experience
were
too
great
to
make
up
whether
the
men
and
women
out
of
doors
had
lived
and
gone
through
many
things
and
great
during
the
time
i
was
away
from
them
and
great
was
my
desire
to
thoroughly
understand
what
was
going
on
that
i
could
know
something
about
it
all
at
last
all
the
words
i
read
were
as
palpable
things
which
i
wanted
rather
to
feel
sensibly
than
get
mere
meaning
out
of
i
tried
to
see
more
in
the
text
than
be
there
i
imagined
some
mysterious
meanings
that
be
in
them
and
tried
at
every
page
to
see
allusions
to
the
past
with
which
my
mind
was
familiar
whether
they
were
there
or
not
at
every
turn
of
the
leaf
i
sought
for
traces
of
what
had
deeply
moved
people
before
the
days
of
my
bondage
and
deep
was
my
dejection
when
it
was
forced
on
my
mind
that
a
new
state
of
things
had
arisen
a
new
life
among
my
kind
which
was
alien
to
my
knowledge
and
my
sentiments
i
felt
as
if
i
was
a
straggler
left
behind
and
lost
in
the
onward
march
of
mankind
yes
there
were
indeed
arrears
if
the
word
is
not
too
weak
for
the
truth
is
that
another
generation
had
come
up
and
i
knew
it
not
and
it
knew
not
me
at
the
foot
of
one
article
i
saw
the
name
of
one
who
had
been
dear
to
me
with
what
avidity
i
flung
myself
on
paper
but
the
other
names
were
nearly
all
new
to
me
new
workers
had
come
upon
the
scene
and
i
was
eager
to
know
their
doings
and
themselves
it
made
me
feel
nearly
desperate
to
have
so
few
books
and
to
know
how
hard
it
would
be
to
get
more
at
an
earlier
date
in
the
old
major
time
it
was
a
dangerous
thing
indeed
to
bring
books
into
the
jail
if
one
was
found
when
the
whole
place
was
searched
as
was
regularly
done
great
was
the
disturbance
and
no
efforts
were
spared
to
find
out
how
they
got
in
and
who
had
helped
in
the
offence
i
did
not
want
to
be
subjected
to
insulting
scrutiny
and
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
useless
i
to
live
without
books
and
did
shut
up
in
myself
tormenting
myself
with
many
a
question
and
problem
on
which
i
had
no
means
of
throwing
any
light
but
i
can
tell
it
all
it
was
in
winter
that
i
came
in
so
in
winter
i
was
to
leave
on
the
oh
with
what
impatience
did
i
look
forward
to
the
winter
how
gladly
did
i
see
the
summer
die
out
the
leaves
turn
yellow
on
the
trees
the
grass
turn
dry
over
the
wide
steppe
summer
is
gone
at
last
the
winds
of
autumn
howl
and
groan
the
first
snow
falls
in
whirling
flakes
the
winter
so
long
for
is
come
come
at
last
oh
how
the
heart
beats
with
the
thought
that
freedom
was
really
at
last
at
last
close
at
hand
yet
it
was
strange
as
the
time
of
times
the
day
of
days
grew
nearer
and
nearer
so
did
my
soul
grow
quieter
and
quieter
i
was
annoyed
at
myself
reproached
myself
even
with
being
cold
indifferent
many
of
the
convicts
as
i
met
them
in
the
when
the
day
work
was
done
used
to
get
out
and
talk
with
me
to
wish
me
joy
ah
little
father
alexander
petrovitch
you
soon
be
out
now
and
here
you
leave
us
poor
devils
behind
well
mertynof
have
you
long
to
wait
still
i
asked
the
man
who
spoke
i
oh
good
lord
i
seven
years
of
it
yet
to
weary
through
then
the
man
sighed
with
a
wandering
look
as
if
he
was
gazing
into
those
intolerable
days
to
come
yes
many
of
my
companions
congratulated
me
in
a
way
that
showed
they
really
felt
what
they
said
i
saw
too
that
there
was
more
disposition
to
meet
me
as
man
to
man
they
drew
nearer
to
me
as
i
was
to
leave
them
the
halo
of
freedom
began
to
surround
me
and
caring
for
that
they
cared
more
for
me
it
was
in
this
spirit
they
bade
me
farewell
k
schniski
a
young
polish
noble
a
sweet
and
amiable
person
was
very
fond
about
this
time
of
walking
in
the
with
me
the
stifling
nights
in
the
barracks
did
him
much
harm
so
he
tried
his
best
to
keep
his
health
by
getting
all
the
exercise
and
fresh
air
he
could
i
am
looking
forward
impatiently
to
the
day
when
will
be
set
free
he
said
with
a
smile
one
day
for
when
you
go
i
shall
that
i
have
just
one
year
more
of
it
to
undergo
need
i
say
what
i
can
yet
not
help
saying
that
freedom
in
idea
always
seemed
to
us
who
were
there
something
free
than
it
ever
can
be
in
reality
that
was
because
our
fancy
was
always
dwelling
upon
it
prisoners
always
exaggerate
when
they
think
of
freedom
and
look
on
a
free
man
we
did
certainly
the
poorest
servant
of
one
of
the
officers
there
seemed
a
sort
of
king
to
us
everything
we
could
imagine
in
a
free
man
compared
with
ourselves
at
least
he
had
no
irons
on
his
limbs
his
head
was
not
shaven
he
could
go
where
and
when
he
liked
with
no
soldiers
to
watch
and
escort
him
the
day
before
i
was
set
free
as
night
fell
i
went
the
last
all
through
and
all
round
the
prison
how
many
a
thousand
times
had
i
made
the
circuit
of
those
palisades
during
those
ten
years
there
at
the
rear
of
the
barracks
had
i
gone
to
and
fro
during
the
whole
of
that
first
year
a
solitary
despairing
man
i
remember
how
i
used
to
reckon
up
the
days
i
had
still
to
pass
there
thousands
thousands
god
how
long
ago
it
seemed
there
the
corner
where
the
poor
prisoned
eagle
wasted
away
petroff
used
often
to
come
to
me
at
that
place
it
seemed
as
if
the
man
would
never
leave
my
side
now
he
would
place
himself
by
my
side
and
walk
along
without
ever
saying
a
word
as
though
he
knew
all
my
thoughts
as
well
as
myself
and
there
was
always
a
strange
inexplicable
sort
of
wondering
look
on
the
man
face
how
many
a
mental
farewell
did
i
take
of
the
black
squared
beams
in
our
barracks
ah
me
how
much
joyless
youth
how
much
strength
for
which
use
there
was
none
was
buried
lost
in
those
walls
youth
and
strength
of
which
the
world
might
surely
have
made
use
for
i
must
speak
my
thoughts
as
to
this
the
hapless
fellows
there
were
perhaps
the
strongest
and
in
one
way
or
another
the
most
gifted
of
our
people
there
was
all
that
strength
of
body
and
of
mind
lost
hopelessly
lost
whose
fault
is
that
yes
whose
fault
that
the
next
day
at
an
early
hour
before
the
men
were
mustered
for
work
i
went
through
all
the
barracks
to
bid
the
men
a
last
farewell
many
a
vigorous
horny
hand
was
held
out
to
me
with
right
some
grasped
and
shook
my
hand
as
though
all
their
hearts
went
with
the
act
but
these
were
the
more
generous
souls
most
of
the
poor
fellows
seemed
so
much
to
feel
that
for
them
i
was
already
a
man
changed
by
what
was
coming
that
they
could
feel
scarce
anything
else
they
knew
that
i
had
friends
in
the
town
that
i
was
going
away
at
once
to
that
i
should
sit
at
their
table
as
their
equal
this
the
poor
fellows
felt
and
although
they
did
their
best
as
they
took
my
hand
that
hand
could
not
be
the
hand
of
an
equal
no
i
too
was
a
gentleman
now
some
turned
their
backs
on
me
and
made
no
reply
to
my
parting
words
i
think
too
that
i
saw
looks
of
aversion
on
some
faces
the
drum
beat
all
the
convicts
went
to
their
work
and
i
was
left
to
myself
souchiloff
had
got
up
before
everybody
that
morning
and
now
set
himself
tremblingly
to
the
task
of
getting
ready
for
me
a
last
cup
of
tea
poor
souchiloff
how
he
cried
when
i
gave
him
my
clothes
my
shirts
my
and
some
money
that
that
he
said
and
he
bit
his
trembling
lips
it
that
i
am
going
to
lose
you
alexander
petrovitch
what
i
do
without
you
there
was
akim
akimitch
too
him
also
i
bade
farewell
your
turn
to
go
will
come
soon
i
pray
said
i
ah
no
i
shall
remain
here
long
long
very
long
yet
he
just
managed
to
say
as
he
pressed
my
hand
i
threw
myself
on
his
neck
we
kissed
ten
minutes
after
the
convicts
had
gone
out
my
companion
and
myself
left
the
jail
we
went
to
the
blacksmith
shop
where
our
irons
were
struck
off
we
had
no
armed
escort
we
went
there
attended
by
a
single
it
was
convicts
who
struck
off
our
irons
in
the
engineers
workshop
i
let
them
do
it
for
my
friend
first
then
went
to
the
anvil
myself
the
smiths
made
me
turn
round
seized
my
leg
and
stretched
it
on
the
anvil
then
they
went
about
the
business
methodically
as
though
they
wanted
to
make
a
very
neat
job
of
it
indeed
the
rivet
man
turn
the
rivet
first
i
heard
the
master
smith
say
there
so
so
now
a
stroke
of
the
hammer
the
irons
fell
i
lifted
them
up
some
strange
impulse
made
me
long
to
have
them
in
my
hands
for
one
last
time
i
could
realise
that
only
a
moment
before
they
had
been
on
my
limbs
said
the
convicts
in
their
broken
voices
but
they
seemed
pleased
as
they
said
it
yes
farewell
liberty
new
life
resurrection
from
the
dead
unspeakable
moment
the
end
