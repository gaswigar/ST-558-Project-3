we
spent
part
of
an
afternoon
and
a
night
at
sea
and
reached
bluff
in
new
zealand
early
in
the
morning
bluff
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
middle
island
and
is
away
down
south
nearly
degrees
below
the
equator
it
lies
as
far
south
of
the
line
as
quebec
lies
north
of
it
and
the
climates
of
the
two
should
be
alike
but
for
some
reason
or
other
it
has
not
been
so
arranged
quebec
is
hot
in
the
summer
and
cold
in
the
winter
but
bluff
climate
is
less
intense
the
cold
weather
is
not
very
cold
the
hot
weather
is
not
very
hot
and
the
difference
between
the
hottest
month
and
the
coldest
is

in

the
rabbit
plague
began
at
bluff
the
man
who
introduced
the
rabbit
there
was
banqueted
and
lauded
but
they
would
hang
him
now
if
they
could
get
him
in
england
the
natural
enemy
of
the
rabbit
is
detested
and
persecuted
in
the
bluff
region
the
natural
enemy
of
the
rabbit
is
honored
and
his
person
is
sacred
the
rabbit
natural
enemy
in
england
is
the
poacher
in
bluff
its
natural
enemy
is
the
stoat
the
weasel
the
ferret
the
cat
and
the
mongoose
in
england
any
person
below
the
heir
who
is
caught
with
a
rabbit
in
his
possession
must
satisfactorily
explain
how
it
got
there
or
he
will
suffer
fine
and
imprisonment
together
with
extinction
of
his
peerage
in
bluff
the
cat
found
with
a
rabbit
in
its
possession
does
not
have
to
explain
everybody
looks
the
other
way
the
person
caught
noticing
would
suffer
fine
and
imprisonment
with
extinction
of
peerage
this
is
a
sure
way
to
undermine
the
moral
fabric
of
a
cat
thirty
years
from
now
there
will
not
be
a
moral
cat
in
new
zealand
some
think
there
is
none
there
now
in
england
the
poacher
is
watched
tracked
hunted
he
dare
not
show
his
face
in
bluff
the
cat
the
weasel
the
stoat
and
the
mongoose
go
up
and
down
whither
they
will
unmolested
by
a
law
of
the
legislature
posted
where
all
may
read
it
is
decreed
that
any
person
found
in
possession
of
one
of
these
creatures
dead
must
satisfactorily
explain
the
circumstances
or
pay
a
fine
of
not
less
than
nor
more
than
the
revenue
from
this
source
is
not
large
persons
who
want
to
pay
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
dead
cat
are
getting
rarer
and
rarer
every
day
this
is
bad
for
the
revenue
was
to
go
to
the
endowment
of
a
university
all
governments
are
more
or
less
in
england
they
fine
the
poacher
whereas
he
ought
to
be
banished
to
new
zealand
new
zealand
would
pay
his
way
and
give
him
wages
it
was
from
bluff
that
we
ought
to
have
cut
across
to
the
west
coast
and
visited
the
new
zealand
switzerland
a
land
of
superb
scenery
made
up
of
snowy
grandeurs
anal
mighty
glaciers
and
beautiful
lakes
and
over
there
also
are
the
wonderful
rivals
of
the
norwegian
and
alaskan
fiords
and
for
neighbor
a
waterfall
of
feet
but
we
were
obliged
to
postpone
the
trip
to
some
later
and
indefinite
time
november
a
lovely
summer
morning
brilliant
blue
sky
a
few
miles
out
from
invercargill
passed
through
vast
level
green
expanses
snowed
over
with
sheep
fine
to
see
the
green
deep
and
very
vivid
sometimes
at
other
times
less
so
but
delicate
and
lovely

at
a
journalist
can
not
lie
to
the
residence
of
hockin
he
has
a
fine
collection
of
books
relating
to
new
zealand
and
his
house
is
a
museum
of
maori
art
and
antiquities
he
has
pictures
and
prints
in
color
of
many
native
chiefs
of
the
past
some
of
them
of
note
in
history
there
is
nothing
of
the
savage
in
the
faces
nothing
could
be
finer
than
these
men
features
nothing
more
intellectual
than
these
faces
nothing
more
masculine
nothing
nobler
than
their
aspect
the
aboriginals
of
australia
and
tasmania
looked
the
savage
but
these
chiefs
looked
like
roman
patricians
the
tattooing
in
these
portraits
ought
to
suggest
the
savage
of
course
but
it
does
not
the
designs
are
so
flowing
and
graceful
and
beautiful
that
they
are
a
most
satisfactory
decoration
it
takes
but
fifteen
minutes
to
get
reconciled
to
the
tattooing
and
but
fifteen
more
to
perceive
that
it
is
just
the
thing
after
that
the
undecorated
european
face
is
unpleasant
and
ignoble
hockiu
gave
us
a
ghastly
curiosity
a
lignified
caterpillar
with
a
plant
growing
out
of
the
back
of
its
neck
a
plant
with
a
slender
stem
inches
high
it
happened
not
by
accident
but
by
design
design
this
caterpillar
was
in
the
act
of
loyally
carrying
out
a
law
inflicted
upon
him
by
nature
a
law
purposely
inflicted
upon
him
to
get
him
into
trouble
a
law
which
was
a
trap
in
pursuance
of
this
law
he
made
the
proper
preparations
for
turning
himself
into
a
that
is
to
say
he
dug
a
little
trench
a
little
grave
and
then
stretched
himself
out
in
it
on
his
stomach
and
partially
buried
himself
then
nature
was
ready
for
him
she
blew
the
spores
of
a
peculiar
fungus
through
the
air
with
a
purpose
some
of
them
fell
into
a
crease
in
the
back
of
the
caterpillar
neck
and
began
to
sprout
and
grow
for
there
was
soil
there
he
had
not
washed
his
neck
the
roots
forced
themselves
down
into
the
worm
person
and
rearward
along
through
its
body
sucking
up
the
creature
juices
for
sap
the
worm
slowly
died
and
turned
to
wood
and
here
he
was
now
a
wooden
caterpillar
with
every
detail
of
his
former
physique
delicately
and
exactly
preserved
and
perpetuated
and
with
that
stem
standing
up
out
of
him
for
his
monument
monument
commemorative
of
his
own
loyalty
and
of
nature
unfair
return
for
it
nature
is
always
acting
like
that
said
of
course
that
the
caterpillar
was
not
conscious
and
did
suffer
she
should
have
known
better
no
caterpillar
can
deceive
nature
if
this
one
could
suffer
nature
would
have
known
it
and
would
have
hunted
up
another
caterpillar
not
that
she
would
have
let
this
one
go
merely
because
it
was
defective
no
she
would
have
waited
and
let
him
turn
into
a
and
then
fried
him
in
the
candle
nature
cakes
a
fish
eyes
over
with
parasites
so
that
it
sha
be
able
to
avoid
its
enemies
or
find
its
food
she
sends
parasites
into
a
system
which
clog
up
its
prongs
and
swell
them
and
make
them
so
uncomfortable
that
the
poor
creature
delivers
itself
from
the
prong
to
ease
its
misery
and
presently
it
has
to
part
with
another
prong
for
the
sake
of
comfort
and
finally
with
a
third
if
it
the
prongs
the
parasite
returns
and
the
same
thing
is
repeated
and
finally
when
the
ability
to
reproduce
prongs
is
lost
through
age
that
poor
old
ca
get
around
any
more
and
so
it
dies
of
starvation
in
australia
is
prevalent
a
horrible
disease
due
to
an
unperfected
tapeworm
unperfected
that
is
what
they
call
it
i
do
not
know
why
for
it
transacts
business
just
as
well
as
if
it
were
finished
and
frescoed
and
gilded
and
all
that
november
to

just
opened
fine
think
of
a

like
this
having
two
such
collections
as
this
and
a

it
is
so
all
over
australasia
if
it
were
a
monarchy
one
might
understand
it
i
mean
an
absolute
monarchy
where
it
is
necessary
to
vote
money
but
take
it
then
art
flourishes
but
these
colonies
are
republics
republics
with
a
wide
suffrage
voters
of
both
sexes
this
one
of
new
zealand
in
republics
neither
the
government
nor
the
rich
private
citizen
is
much
given
to
propagating
art
all
over
australasia
pictures
by
famous
european
artists
are
bought
for
the
public

by

november
on

this
goes
twenty
and
miles
an
hour
schedule
time
but
it
is
fast
enough
the
outlook
upon
sea
and
land
is
so
interesting
and
the
cars
so
comfortable
they
are
not
english
and
not
american
they
are
the

combination
of
the
two
a
narrow
and
railed
porch
along
the

where
a

can
walk
up
and
down
a
lavatory
in
each

this
is
progress
this
is
spirit
in
new

these
fast
expresses
run
twice
a
week
it
is
well
to
know
this
if
you
want
to
be
a
bird
and
fly
through
the
country
at
a
gait
otherwise
you
may
start
on
one
of
the
five
wrong
days
and
then
you
will
get
a
train
that
ca
overtake
its
own
shadow
by
contrast
these
pleasant
cars
call
to
mind
the
cars
at
maryborough
australia
and
the
passengers
talk
about
the
and
the
hotel
somewhere
on
the
road
to
maryborough
i
changed
for
a
while
to
a
there
were
two
gentlemen
there
both
riding
backward
one
at
each
end
of
the
compartment
they
were
acquaintances
of
each
other
i
sat
down
facing
the
one
that
sat
at
the
starboard
window
he
had
a
good
face
and
a
friendly
look
and
i
judged
from
his
dress
that
he
was
a
dissenting
minister
he
was
along
toward
fifty
of
his
own
motion
he
struck
a
match
and
shaded
it
with
his
hand
for
me
to
light
my
cigar
i
take
the
rest
from
my
diary
in
order
to
start
conversation
i
asked
him
something
about
maryborough
he
said
in
a
most
pleasant
even
musical
voice
but
with
quiet
and
cultured
decision
it
a
charming
town
with
a
hell
of
a
hotel
i
was
astonished
it
seemed
so
odd
to
hear
a
minister
swear
out
loud
he
went
placidly
on
it
the
worst
hotel
in
australia
well
one
may
go
further
and
say
in
australasia
bad
beds
no
none
at
all
just
the
pillows
too
yes
the
pillows
too
just
sand
and
not
a
good
quality
of
sand
it
packs
too
hard
and
has
never
been
screened
there
is
too
much
gravel
in
it
it
is
like
sleeping
on
nuts
is
there
any
good
sand
plenty
of
it
there
is
as
good
in
this
region
as
the
world
can
furnish
aerated
sand
and
loose
but
they
wo
buy
it
they
want
something
that
will
pack
solid
and
petrify
how
are
the
rooms
eight
feet
square
and
a
sheet
of
iced
to
step
on
in
the
morning
when
you
get
out
of
the
as
to
lights
lamp
a
good
one
no
it
the
kind
that
sheds
a
gloom
i
like
a
lamp
that
burns
all
night
this
one
wo
you
must
blow
it
out
early
that
is
bad
one
might
want
it
again
in
the
night
ca
find
it
in
the
dark
there
no
trouble
you
can
find
it
by
the
stench
wardrobe
two
nails
on
the
door
to
hang
seven
suits
of
clothes
on
if
you
got
them
bells
there
are
any
what
do
you
do
when
you
want
service
shout
but
it
wo
fetch
anybody
suppose
you
want
the
chambermaid
to
empty
the
slopjar
there
is
any
the
hotels
do
keep
them
that
is
outside
of
sydney
and
melbourne
yes
i
knew
that
i
was
only
talking
it
the
oddest
thing
in
australia
another
thing
i
got
to
get
up
in
the
dark
in
the
morning
to
take
the
train
now
if
the
boots
there
is
any
well
the
porter
there
is
any
but
who
will
call
me
nobody
you
call
yourself
and
you
light
yourself
too
there
not
be
a
light
burning
in
the
halls
or
anywhere
and
if
you
do
carry
a
light
you
break
your
neck
but
who
will
help
me
down
with
my
baggage
nobody
however
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
in
maryborough
there
an
american
who
has
lived
there
half
a
lifetime
a
fine
man
and
prosperous
and
popular
he
will
be
on
the
lookout
for
you
you
wo
have
any
trouble
sleep
in
peace
he
will
rout
you
out
and
you
will
make
your
train
where
is
your
manager
i
left
him
at
ballarat
studying
the
language
and
besides
he
had
to
go
to
melbourne
and
get
us
ready
for
new
zealand
i
not
tried
to
pilot
myself
before
and
it
does
look
easy
easy
you
selected
the
very
most
difficult
piece
of
railroad
in
australia
for
your
experiment
there
are
twelve
miles
of
this
road
which
no
man
without
good
executive
ability
can
ever
hope
tell
me
have
you
good
executive
ability
executive
ability
i
well
i
think
so
but
that
settles
it
the
tone
of
oh
you
would
ever
make
it
in
the
world
however
that
american
will
point
you
right
and
you
go
you
got
tickets
yes
round
trip
all
the
way
to
sydney
ah
there
it
is
you
see
you
are
going
in
the
by
castlemaine
twelve
miles
instead
of
the
by
ballarat
in
order
to
save
two
hours
of
fooling
along
the
road
now
then
do
interrupt
let
me
have
the
floor
you
going
to
save
the
government
a
deal
of
hauling
but
that
nothing
your
ticket
is
by
ballarat
and
it
good
over
that
twelve
miles
and
so
but
why
should
the
government
care
which
way
i
go
goodness
knows
ask
of
the
winds
that
far
away
with
fragments
strewed
the
sea
as
the
boy
that
stood
on
the
burning
deck
used
to
say
the
government
chooses
to
do
its
railway
business
in
its
own
way
and
it
does
know
as
much
about
it
as
the
french
in
the
beginning
they
tried
idiots
then
they
imported
the
french
which
was
going
backwards
you
see
now
it
runs
the
roads
itself
which
is
going
backwards
again
you
see
why
do
you
know
in
order
to
curry
favor
with
the
voters
the
government
puts
down
a
road
wherever
anybody
wants
it
anybody
that
owns
two
sheep
and
a
dog
and
by
consequence
we
got
in
the
colony
of
victoria
railway
stations
and
the
business
done
at
eighty
of
them
does
foot
up
twenty
shillings
a
week
five
dollars
oh
come
it
true
it
the
absolute
truth
why
there
are
three
or
four
men
on
wages
at
every
station
i
know
it
and
the
does
pay
for
the
to
sanctify
their
coffee
with
it
just
as
i
say
and
accommodating
why
if
you
shake
a
rag
the
train
will
stop
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
to
pick
you
up
all
that
kind
of
politics
costs
you
see
and
then
besides
any
town
that
has
a
good
many
votes
and
wants
a
fine
station
gets
it
do
you
overlook
that
maryborough
station
if
you
take
an
interest
in
governmental
curiosities
why
you
can
put
the
whole
population
of
maryborough
into
it
and
give
them
a
sofa
apiece
and
have
room
for
more
you
have
fifteen
stations
in
america
that
are
as
big
and
you
probably
have
five
that
are
half
as
fine
why
perfectly
elegant
and
the
clock
everybody
will
show
you
the
clock
there
is
a
station
in
europe
that
got
such
a
clock
it
strike
and
that
one
mercy
it
has
any
bell
and
as
you
have
cause
to
remember
if
you
keep
your
reason
all
australia
is
simply
bedamned
with
bells
on
every
night
and
day
they
jingle
a
tiresome
chime
of
half
a
dozen
notes
all
the
clocks
in
town
at
once
all
the
clocks
in
australasia
at
once
and
all
the
very
same
notes
first

upward

then
the
clock
say
at
midnight
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
clang
and
by
that
time
you
hello
what
all
this
excitement
about
a
runaway
scared
by
the
train
why
you
think
this
train
could
scare
anything
well
when
they
build
eighty
stations
at
a
loss
and
a
lot
of
and
clocks
like
maryborough
at
another
loss
the
government
has
got
to
economize
somewhere
has
it
very
well
look
at
the
rolling
stock
that
where
they
save
the
money
why
that
train
from
maryborough
will
consist
of
eighteen
and
two
cheap
poor
shabby
slovenly
no
drinking
water
no
sanitary
arrangements
every
imaginable
inconvenience
and
slow
oh
the
gait
of
cold
molasses
no
no
springs
and
they
jolt
your
head
off
every
time
they
start
or
stop
that
where
they
make
their
little
economies
you
see
they
spend
tons
of
money
to
house
you
palatially
while
you
wait
fifteen
minutes
for
a
train
then
degrade
you
to
six
hours
to
get
the
foolish
outlay
back
what
a
rational
man
really
needs
is
discomfort
while
he
waiting
then
his
journey
in
a
nice
train
would
be
a
grateful
change
but
no
that
would
be
common
sense
and
out
of
place
in
a
government
and
then
besides
they
save
in
that
other
little
detail
you
know
repudiate
their
own
tickets
and
collect
a
poor
little
illegitimate
extra
shilling
out
of
you
for
that
twelve
miles
and
well
in
any
case
wait
there
more
leave
that
american
out
of
the
account
and
see
what
would
happen
there
nobody
on
hand
to
examine
your
ticket
when
you
arrive
but
the
conductor
will
come
and
examine
it
when
the
train
is
ready
to
start
it
is
too
late
to
buy
your
extra
ticket
now
the
train
ca
wait
and
wo
you
must
climb
out
but
ca
i
pay
the
conductor
no
he
is
not
authorized
to
receive
the
money
and
he
wo
you
must
climb
out
there
no
other
way
i
tell
you
the
railway
management
is
about
the
only
thoroughly
european
thing
here
continentally
european
i
mean
not
english
it
the
continental
business
in
perfection
down
fine
oh
yes
even
to
the
of
weighing
baggage
the
train
slowed
up
at
his
place
as
he
stepped
out
he
said
yes
you
like
maryborough
plenty
of
intelligence
there
it
a
charming
place
with
a
hell
of
a
hotel
then
he
was
gone
i
turned
to
the
other
gentleman
is
your
friend
in
the
ministry
no
studying
for
it
chapter
xxxii
the
man
with
a
new
idea
is
a
crank
until
the
idea
succeeds
wilson
new
calendar
it
was
junior
england
all
the
way
to
christchurch
in
fact
just
a
garden
and
christchurch
is
an
english
town
with
an
annex
and
a
winding
english
brook
just
like
the
avon
and
named
the
avon
but
from
a
man
not
from
shakespeare
river
its
grassy
banks
are
bordered
by
the
stateliest
and
most
impressive
weeping
willows
to
be
found
in
the
world
i
suppose
they
continue
the
line
of
a
great
ancestor
they
were
grown
from
sprouts
of
the
willow
that
sheltered
napoleon
grave
in
helena
it
is
a
settled
old
community
with
all
the
serenities
the
graces
the
conveniences
and
the
comforts
of
the
ideal
if
it
had
an
established
church
and
social
inequality
it
would
be
england
over
again
with
hardly
a
lack
in
the
museum
we
saw
many
curious
and
interesting
things
among
others
a
fine
native
house
of
the
olden
time
with
all
the
details
true
to
the
facts
and
the
showy
colors
right
and
in
their
proper
places
all
the
details
the
fine
mats
and
rugs
and
things
the
elaborate
and
wonderful
wood
carvings
wonderful
surely
considering
who
did
them
wonderful
in
design
and
particularly
in
execution
for
they
were
done
with
admirable
sharpness
and
exactness
and
yet
with
no
better
tools
than
flint
and
jade
and
shell
could
furnish
and
the
were
there
ancestor
above
ancestor
with
tongues
protruded
and
hands
clasped
comfortably
over
bellies
containing
other
people
ancestors
grotesque
and
ugly
devils
every
one
but
lovingly
carved
and
ably
and
the
stuffed
natives
were
present
in
their
proper
places
and
looking
as
natural
as
life
and
the
housekeeping
utensils
were
there
too
and
close
at
hand
the
carved
and
finely
ornamented
war
canoe
and
we
saw
little
jade
gods
to
hang
around
the
neck
not
everybody
but
sacred
to
the
necks
of
natives
of
rank
also
jade
weapons
and
many
kinds
of
jade
trinkets
all
made
out
of
that
excessively
hard
stone
without
the
help
of
any
tool
of
iron
and
some
of
these
things
had
small
round
holes
bored
through
them
nobody
knows
how
it
was
done
a
mystery
a
lost
art
i
think
it
was
said
that
if
you
want
such
a
hole
bored
in
a
piece
of
jade
now
you
must
send
it
to
london
or
amsterdam
where
the
lapidaries
are
also
we
saw
a
complete
skeleton
of
the
giant
moa
it
stood
ten
feet
high
and
must
have
been
a
sight
to
look
at
when
it
was
a
living
bird
it
was
a
kicker
like
the
ostrich
in
fight
it
did
not
use
its
beak
but
its
foot
it
must
have
been
a
convincing
kind
of
kick
if
a
person
had
his
back
to
the
bird
and
did
not
see
who
it
was
that
did
it
he
would
think
he
had
been
kicked
by
a
there
must
have
been
a
sufficiency
of
moas
in
the
old
forgotten
days
when
his
breed
walked
the
earth
his
bones
are
found
in
vast
masses
all
crammed
together
in
huge
graves
they
are
not
in
caves
but
in
the
ground
nobody
knows
how
they
happened
to
get
concentrated
there
mind
they
are
bones
not
fossils
this
means
that
the
moa
has
not
been
extinct
very
long
still
this
is
the
only
new
zealand
creature
which
has
no
mention
in
that
otherwise
comprehensive
literature
the
native
legends
this
is
a
significant
detail
and
is
good
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
moa
has
been
extinct
years
since
the
maori
has
himself
by
tradition
been
in
new
zealand
since
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
he
came
from
an
unknown
land
the
first
maori
did
then
sailed
back
in
his
canoe
and
brought
his
tribe
and
they
removed
the
aboriginal
peoples
into
the
sea
and
into
the
ground
and
took
the
land
that
is
the
tradition
that
that
first
maori
could
come
is
understandable
for
anybody
can
come
to
a
place
when
he
is
trying
to
but
how
that
discoverer
found
his
way
back
home
again
without
a
compass
is
his
secret
and
he
died
with
it
in
him
his
language
indicates
that
he
came
from
polynesia
he
told
where
he
came
from
but
he
could
spell
well
so
one
ca
find
the
place
on
the
map
because
people
who
could
spell
better
than
he
could
spelt
the
resemblance
all
out
of
it
when
they
made
the
map
however
it
is
better
to
have
a
map
that
is
spelt
right
than
one
that
has
information
in
it
in
new
zealand
women
have
the
right
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature
but
they
can
not
be
members
themselves
the
law
extending
the
suffrage
to
them
event
into
effect
in
the
population
of
christchurch
census
of
was
the
first
election
under
the
law
was
held
in
november
of
that
year
number
of
men
who
voted
number
of
women
who
voted
these
figures
ought
to
convince
us
that
women
are
not
as
indifferent
about
politics
as
some
people
would
have
us
believe
in
new
zealand
as
a
whole
the
estimated
adult
female
population
was
of
these
qualified
and
registered
their
names
on
the
rolls
per
cent
of
the
whole
of
these
went
to
the
polls
and
voted
per
cent
do
men
ever
turn
out
better
than
that
in
america
or
elsewhere
here
is
a
remark
to
the
other
credit
too
i
take
it
from
the
official
report
a
feature
of
the
election
was
the
orderliness
and
sobriety
of
the
people
women
were
in
no
way
molested
at
home
a
standing
argument
against
woman
suffrage
has
always
been
that
women
could
not
go
to
the
polls
without
being
insulted
the
arguments
against
woman
suffrage
have
always
taken
the
easy
form
of
prophecy
the
prophets
have
been
prophesying
ever
since
the
woman
rights
movement
began
in
and
in
years
they
have
never
scored
a
hit
men
ought
to
begin
to
feel
a
sort
of
respect
for
their
mothers
and
wives
and
sisters
by
this
time
the
women
deserve
a
change
of
attitude
like
that
for
they
have
wrought
well
in
years
they
have
swept
an
imposingly
large
number
of
unfair
laws
from
the
statute
books
of
america
in
that
brief
time
these
serfs
have
set
themselves
free
essentially
men
could
not
have
done
so
much
for
themselves
in
that
time
without
bloodshed
at
least
they
never
have
and
that
is
argument
that
they
did
know
how
the
women
have
accomplished
a
peaceful
revolution
and
a
very
beneficent
one
and
yet
that
has
not
convinced
the
average
man
that
they
are
intelligent
and
have
courage
and
energy
and
perseverance
and
fortitude
it
takes
much
to
convince
the
average
man
of
anything
and
perhaps
nothing
can
ever
make
him
realize
that
he
is
the
average
woman
inferior
yet
in
several
important
details
the
evidences
seems
to
show
that
that
is
what
he
is
man
has
ruled
the
human
race
from
the
beginning
but
he
should
remember
that
up
to
the
middle
of
the
present
century
it
was
a
dull
world
and
ignorant
and
stupid
but
it
is
not
such
a
dull
world
now
and
is
growing
less
and
less
dull
all
the
time
this
is
woman
opportunity
she
has
had
none
before
i
wonder
where
man
will
be
in
another
years
in
the
new
zealand
law
occurs
this
the
word
person
wherever
it
occurs
throughout
the
act
includes
woman
that
is
promotion
you
see
by
that
enlargement
of
the
word
the
matron
with
the
garnered
wisdom
and
experience
of
fifty
years
becomes
at
one
jump
the
political
equal
of
her
callow
kid
of
the
white
population
of
the
colony
is
the
maori
population
is
the
whites
elect
seventy
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
maoris
four
the
maori
women
vote
for
their
four
members
november
after
four
pleasant
days
in
christchurch
we
are
to
leave
at
midnight
kinsey
gave
me
an
ornithorhynchus
and
i
am
taming
it
sunday
sailed
last
night
in
the
flora
from
lyttelton
so
we
did
i
remember
it
yet
the
people
who
sailed
in
the
flora
that
night
may
forget
some
other
things
if
they
live
a
good
while
but
they
will
not
live
long
enough
to
forget
that
the
flora
is
about
the
equivalent
of
a
but
when
the
union
company
find
it
inconvenient
to
keep
a
contract
and
lucrative
to
break
it
they
smuggle
her
into
passenger
service
and
keep
the
change
they
give
no
notice
of
their
projected
depredation
you
innocently
buy
tickets
for
the
advertised
passenger
boat
and
when
you
get
down
to
lyttelton
at
midnight
you
find
that
they
have
substituted
the
scow
they
have
plenty
of
good
boats
but
no
competition
and
that
is
the
trouble
it
is
too
late
now
to
make
other
arrangements
if
you
have
engagements
ahead
it
is
a
powerful
company
it
has
a
monopoly
and
everybody
is
afraid
of
it
including
the
government
representative
who
stands
at
the
end
of
the
to
tally
the
passengers
and
see
that
no
boat
receives
a
greater
number
than
the
law
allows
her
to
carry
this
representative
saw
the
scow
receive
a
number
which
was
far
in
excess
of
its
privilege
and
winked
a
politic
wink
and
said
nothing
the
passengers
bore
with
meekness
the
cheat
which
had
been
put
upon
them
and
made
no
complaint
it
was
like
being
at
home
in
america
where
abused
passengers
act
in
just
the
same
way
a
few
days
before
the
union
company
had
discharged
a
captain
for
getting
a
boat
into
danger
and
had
advertised
this
act
as
evidence
of
its
vigilance
in
looking
after
the
safety
of
the
passengers
for
thugging
a
captain
costs
the
company
nothing
but
when
opportunity
offered
to
send
this
dangerously
overcrowded
tub
to
sea
and
save
a
little
trouble
and
a
tidy
penny
by
it
it
forgot
to
worry
about
the
safety
the
first
officer
told
me
that
the
flora
was
privileged
to
carry
passengers
she
must
have
had
all
of
on
board
all
the
cabins
were
full
all
the
in
the
main
stable
were
full
the
spaces
at
the
heads
of
companionways
were
full
every
inch
of
floor
and
table
in
the
was
packed
with
sleeping
men
and
remained
so
until
the
place
was
required
for
breakfast
all
the
chairs
and
benches
on
the
hurricane
deck
were
occupied
and
still
there
were
people
who
had
to
walk
about
all
night
if
the
flora
had
gone
down
that
night
half
of
the
people
on
board
would
have
been
wholly
without
means
of
escape
the
owners
of
that
boat
were
not
technically
guilty
of
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
but
they
were
morally
guilty
of
it
i
had
a
in
the
main
stable
a
cavern
fitted
up
with
a
long
double
file
of
bunks
the
files
separated
by
a
calico
partition
twenty
men
and
boys
on
one
side
of
it
twenty
women
and
girls
on
the
other
the
place
was
as
dark
as
the
soul
of
the
union
company
and
smelt
like
a
kennel
when
the
vessel
got
out
into
the
heavy
seas
and
began
to
pitch
and
wallow
the
cavern
prisoners
became
immediately
seasick
and
then
the
peculiar
results
that
ensued
laid
all
my
previous
experiences
of
the
kind
well
away
in
the
shade
and
the
wails
the
groans
the
cries
the
shrieks
the
strange
ejaculations
it
was
wonderful
the
women
and
children
and
some
of
the
men
and
boys
spent
the
night
in
that
place
for
they
were
too
ill
to
leave
it
but
the
rest
of
us
got
up
by
and
by
and
finished
the
night
on
the
that
boat
was
the
foulest
i
was
ever
in
and
the
smell
of
the
breakfast
saloon
when
we
threaded
our
way
among
the
layers
of
steaming
passengers
stretched
upon
its
floor
and
its
tables
was
incomparable
for
efficiency
a
good
many
of
us
got
ashore
at
the
first
to
seek
another
ship
after
a
wait
of
three
hours
we
got
good
rooms
in
the
mahinapua
a
wee
little
of
a
boat
only
tons
burthen
clean
and
comfortable
good
service
good
beds
good
table
and
no
crowding
the
seas
danced
her
about
like
a
duck
but
she
was
safe
and
capable
next
morning
early
she
went
through
the
french
pass
a
narrow
gateway
of
rock
between
bold
headlands
so
narrow
in
fact
that
it
seemed
no
wider
than
a
street
the
current
tore
through
there
like
a
and
the
boat
darted
through
like
a
telegram
the
passage
was
made
in
half
a
minute
then
we
were
in
a
wide
place
where
noble
vast
eddies
swept
grandly
round
and
round
in
shoal
water
and
i
wondered
what
they
would
do
with
the
little
boat
they
did
as
they
pleased
with
her
they
picked
her
up
and
flung
her
around
like
nothing
and
landed
her
gently
on
the
solid
smooth
bottom
of
sand
so
gently
indeed
that
we
barely
felt
her
touch
it
barely
felt
her
quiver
when
she
came
to
a
standstill
the
water
was
as
clear
as
glass
the
sand
on
the
bottom
was
vividly
distinct
and
the
fishes
seemed
to
be
swimming
about
in
nothing
fishing
lines
were
brought
out
but
before
we
could
bait
the
hooks
the
boat
was
off

away
again
chapter
xxxiii
let
us
be
grateful
to
adam
our
benefactor
he
cut
us
out
of
the
blessing
of
idleness
and
won
for
us
the
curse
of
labor
wilson
new
calendar
we
soon
reached
the
town
of
nelson
and
spent
the
most
of
the
day
there
visiting
acquaintances
and
driving
with
them
about
the
garden
the
whole
region
is
a
garden
excepting
the
scene
of
the
maungatapu
murders
of
thirty
years
ago
that
is
a
wild
place
wild
and
lonely
an
ideal
place
for
a
murder
it
is
at
the
base
of
a
vast
rugged
densely
timbered
mountain
in
the
deep
twilight
of
that
forest
solitude
four
desperate
rascals
burgess
sullivan
levy
and
kelley
ambushed
themselves
beside
the
to
murder
and
rob
four
travelers
kempthorne
mathieu
dudley
and
de
pontius
the
latter
a
new
yorker
a
harmless
old
laboring
man
came
wandering
along
and
as
his
presence
was
an
embarrassment
they
choked
him
hid
him
and
then
resumed
their
watch
for
the
four
they
had
to
wait
a
while
but
eventually
everything
turned
out
as
they
desired
that
dark
episode
is
the
one
large
event
in
the
history
of
nelson
the
fame
of
it
traveled
far
burgess
made
a
confession
it
is
a
remarkable
paper
for
brevity
succinctness
and
concentration
it
is
perhaps
without
its
peer
in
the
literature
of
murder
there
are
no
waste
words
in
it
there
is
no
obtrusion
of
matter
not
pertinent
to
the
occasion
nor
any
departure
from
the
dispassionate
tone
proper
to
a
formal
business
statement
for
that
is
what
it
is
a
business
statement
of
a
murder
by
the
chief
engineer
of
it
or
superintendent
or
foreman
or
whatever
one
may
prefer
to
call
him
we
were
getting
impatient
when
we
saw
four
men
and
a
coming
i
left
my
cover
and
had
a
look
at
the
men
for
levy
had
told
me
that
mathieu
was
a
small
man
and
wore
a
large
beard
and
that
it
was
a
chestnut
horse
i
said
they
come
they
were
then
a
good
distance
away
i
took
the
caps
off
my
gun
and
put
fresh
ones
on
i
said
keep
where
you
are
i
put
them
up
and
you
give
me
your
gun
while
you
tie
them
it
was
arranged
as
i
have
described
the
men
came
they
arrived
within
about
fifteen
yards
when
i
stepped
up
and
said
bail
up
that
means
all
of
them
to
get
together
i
made
them
fall
back
on
the
upper
side
of
the
road
with
their
faces
up
the
range
and
sullivan
brought
me
his
gun
and
then
tied
their
hands
behind
them
the
horse
was
very
quiet
all
the
time
he
did
not
move
when
they
were
all
tied
sullivan
took
the
horse
up
the
hill
and
put
him
in
the
bush
he
cut
the
rope
and
let
the
swags
a
swag
is
a
kit
a
pack
small
baggage
fall
on
the
ground
and
then
came
to
me
we
then
marched
the
men
down
the
incline
to
the
creek
the
water
at
this
time
barely
running
up
this
creek
we
took
the
men
we
went
i
daresay
five
or
six
hundred
yards
up
it
which
took
us
nearly
to
accomplish
then
we
turned
to
the
right
up
the
range
we
went
i
daresay
one
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
the
creek
and
there
we
sat
down
with
the
men
i
said
to
sullivan
down
your
gun
and
search
these
men
which
he
did
i
asked
them
their
several
names
they
told
me
i
asked
them
if
they
were
expected
at
nelson
they
said
if
such
their
lives
would
have
been
spared
in
money
we
took
odd
i
said
this
all
you
have
you
had
better
tell
me
sullivan
said
is
a
bag
of
gold
i
said
on
that
is
there
any
gold
when
kempthorne
said
my
gold
is
in
the
portmanteau
and
i
trust
you
will
not
take
it
all
i
said
must
take
you
away
one
at
a
time
because
the
range
is
steep
just
here
and
then
we
will
let
you
go
they
said
right
most
cheerfully
we
tied
their
feet
and
took
dudley
with
us
we
went
about
sixty
yards
with
him
this
was
through
a
scrub
it
was
arranged
the
night
previously
that
it
would
be
best
to
choke
them
in
case
the
report
of
the
arms
might
be
heard
from
the
road
and
if
they
were
missed
they
never
would
be
found
so
we
tied
a
handkerchief
over
his
eyes
when
sullivan
took
the
sash
off
his
waist
put
it
round
his
neck
and
so
strangled
him
sullivan
after
i
had
killed
the
old
laboring
man
found
fault
with
the
way
he
was
choked
he
said
next
we
do
i
show
you
my
way
i
said
have
never
done
such
a
thing
before
i
have
shot
a
man
but
never
choked
one
we
returned
to
the
others
when
kempthorne
said
noise
was
that
i
said
it
was
caused
by
breaking
through
the
scrub
this
was
taking
too
much
time
so
it
was
agreed
to
shoot
them
with
that
i
said
take
you
no
further
but
separate
you
and
then
loose
one
of
you
and
he
can
relieve
the
others
so
with
that
sullivan
took
de
pontius
to
the
left
of
where
kempthorne
was
sitting
i
took
mathieu
to
the
right
i
tied
a
strap
round
his
legs
and
shot
him
with
a
revolver
he
yelled
i
ran
from
him
with
my
gun
in
my
hand
i
sighted
kempthorne
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
i
presented
the
gun
and
shot
him
behind
the
right
ear
his
life
blood
welled
from
him
and
he
died
instantaneously
sullivan
had
shot
de
pontius
in
the
meantime
and
then
came
to
me
i
said
to
mathieu
indicating
the
spot
where
he
lay
he
shortly
returned
and
said
had
to
chiv
that
fellow
he
was
not
dead
a
cant
word
meaning
that
he
had
to
stab
him
returning
to
the
road
we
passed
where
de
pontius
lay
and
was
dead
sullivan
said
is
the
digger
the
others
were
all
storekeepers
this
is
the
digger
let
cover
him
up
for
should
the
others
be
found
they
think
he
done
it
and
sloped
meaning
he
had
gone
so
with
that
we
threw
all
the
stones
on
him
and
then
left
him
this
bloody
work
took
nearly
an
hour
and
a
half
from
the
time
we
stopped
the
men
anyone
who
reads
that
confession
will
think
that
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
destitute
of
emotions
destitute
of
feeling
that
is
partly
true
as
regarded
others
he
was
plainly
without
feeling
utterly
cold
and
pitiless
but
as
regarded
himself
the
case
was
different
while
he
cared
nothing
for
the
future
of
the
murdered
men
he
cared
a
great
deal
for
his
own
it
makes
one
flesh
creep
to
read
the
introduction
to
his
confession
the
judge
on
the
bench
characterized
it
as
scandalously
blasphemous
and
it
certainly
reads
so
but
burgess
meant
no
blasphemy
he
was
merely
a
brute
and
whatever
he
said
or
wrote
was
sure
to
expose
the
fact
his
redemption
was
a
very
real
thing
to
him
and
he
was
as
jubilantly
happy
on
the
gallows
as
ever
was
christian
martyr
at
the
stake
we
dwellers
in
this
world
are
strangely
made
and
mysteriously
circumstanced
we
have
to
suppose
that
the
murdered
men
are
lost
and
that
burgess
is
saved
but
we
can
not
suppress
our
natural
regrets
written
in
my
dungeon
drear
this
of
august
in
the
year
of
grace
to
god
be
ascribed
all
power
and
glory
in
subduing
the
rebellious
spirit
of
a
most
guilty
wretch
who
has
been
brought
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
faithful
follower
of
christ
to
see
his
wretched
and
guilty
state
inasmuch
as
hitherto
he
has
led
an
awful
and
wretched
life
and
through
the
assurance
of
this
faithful
soldier
of
christ
he
has
been
led
and
also
believes
that
christ
will
yet
receive
and
cleanse
him
from
all
his
and
bloody
sins
i
lie
under
the
imputation
which
says
now
and
let
us
reason
together
saith
the
lord
though
your
sins
be
as
scarlet
they
shall
be
as
white
as
snow
though
they
be
red
like
crimson
they
shall
be
as
wool
on
this
promise
i
rely
we
sailed
in
the
afternoon
late
spent
a
few
hours
at
new
plymouth
then
sailed
again
and
reached
auckland
the
next
day
november
and
remained
in
that
fine
city
several
days
its
situation
is
commanding
and
the
is
superb
there
are
charming
drives
all
about
and
by
courtesy
of
friends
we
had
opportunity
to
enjoy
them
from
the
grassy
of
mount
eden
one
eye
ranges
over
a
grand
sweep
and
variety
of
scenery
forests
clothed
in
luxuriant
foliage
rolling
green
fields
conflagrations
of
flowers
receding
and
dimming
stretches
of
green
plain
broken
by
lofty
and
symmetrical
old
craters
then
the
blue
bays
twinkling
and
sparkling
away
into
the
dreamy
distances
where
the
mountains
loom
spiritual
in
their
veils
of
haze
it
is
from
auckland
that
one
goes
to
rotorua
the
region
of
the
renowned
hot
lakes
and
geysers
one
of
the
chief
wonders
of
new
zealand
but
i
was
not
well
enough
to
make
the
trip
the
government
has
a
sanitorium
there
and
everything
is
comfortable
for
the
tourist
and
the
invalid
the
government
official
physician
is
almost
in
his
estimates
of
the
efficacy
of
the
baths
when
he
is
talking
about
rheumatism
gout
paralysis
and
such
things
but
when
he
is
talking
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
waters
in
eradicating
the
he
seems
to
have
no
reserves
the
baths
will
cure
the
no
matter
how
chronic
it
is
and
cure
it
so
effectually
that
even
the
desire
to
drink
intoxicants
will
come
no
more
there
should
be
a
rush
from
europe
and
america
to
that
place
and
when
the
victims
of
alcoholism
find
out
what
they
can
get
by
going
there
the
rush
will
begin
the
district
of
new
zealand
comprises
an
area
of
upwards
of
acres
or
close
on
square
miles
rotorua
is
the
favorite
place
it
is
the
center
of
a
rich
field
of
lake
and
mountain
scenery
from
rotorua
as
a
base
the
makes
excursions
the
crowd
of
sick
people
is
great
and
growing
rotorua
is
the
carlsbad
of
australasia
it
is
from
auckland
that
the
kauri
gum
is
shipped
for
a
long
time
now
about
tons
of
it
have
been
brought
into
the
town
per
year
it
is
worth
about
per
ton
unassorted
assorted
the
finest
grades
are
worth
about
it
goes
to
america
chiefly
it
is
in
lumps
and
is
hard
and
smooth
and
looks
like
amber
the
like
new
amber
and
the
dark
brown
like
rich
old
amber
and
it
has
the
pleasant
feel
of
amber
too
some
of
the
samples
were
a
tolerably
fair
counterfeit
of
uncut
south
african
diamonds
they
were
so
perfectly
smooth
and
polished
and
transparent
it
is
manufactured
into
varnish
a
varnish
which
answers
for
copal
varnish
and
is
cheaper
the
gum
is
dug
up
out
of
the
ground
it
has
been
there
for
ages
it
is
the
sap
of
the
kauri
tree
campbell
of
auckland
told
me
he
sent
a
cargo
of
it
to
england
fifty
years
ago
but
nothing
came
of
the
venture
nobody
knew
what
to
do
with
it
so
it
was
sold

let
us
not

at

wilson
new
calendar
november
we
reached
gisborne
and
anchored
in
a
big
bay
there
was
a
heavy
sea
on
so
we
remained
on
board
we
were
a
mile
from
shore
a
little
put
out
from
the
land
she
was
an
object
of
thrilling
interest
she
would
climb
to
the
summit
of
a
billow
reel
drunkenly
there
a
moment
dim
and
gray
in
the
driving
storm
of
spindrift
then
make
a
plunge
like
a
diver
and
remain
out
of
sight
until
one
had
given
her
up
then
up
she
would
dart
again
on
a
steep
slant
toward
the
sky
shedding
niagaras
of
water
from
her
forecastle
and
this
she
kept
up
all
the
way
out
to
us
she
brought
passengers
in
her
stomach
men
and
women
mainly
a
traveling
dramatic
company
in
sight
on
deck
were
the
crew
in
yellow
waterproof
canvas
suits
and
boots
to
the
thigh
the
deck
was
never
quiet
for
a
moment
and
seldom
nearer
level
than
a
ladder
and
noble
were
the
seas
which
leapt
aboard
and
went
flooding
aft
we
rove
a
long
line
to
the
hung
a
most
primitive
basketchair
to
it
and
swung
it
out
into
the
spacious
air
of
heaven
and
there
it
swayed
waiting
for
its
chance
then
down
it
shot
skillfully
aimed
and
was
grabbed
by
the
two
men
on
the
forecastle
a
young
fellow
belonging
to
our
crew
was
in
the
chair
to
be
a
protection
to
the
at
once
a
couple
of
ladies
appeared
from
below
took
seats
in
his
lap
we
hoisted
them
into
the
sky
waited
a
moment
till
the
roll
of
the
ship
brought
them
in
overhead
then
we
lowered
suddenly
away
and
seized
the
chair
as
it
struck
the
deck
we
took
the
aboard
and
delivered
into
the
tug
among
them
several
aged
ladies
and
one
blind
one
and
all
without
accident
it
was
a
fine
piece
of
work
ours
is
a
nice
ship
roomy
comfortable
and
satisfactory
now
and
then
we
step
on
a
rat
in
a
hotel
but
we
have
had
no
rats
on
shipboard
lately
unless
perhaps
in
the
flora
we
had
more
serious
things
to
think
of
there
and
did
not
notice
i
have
noticed
that
it
is
only
in
ships
and
hotels
which
still
employ
the
odious
chinese
gong
that
you
find
rats
the
reason
would
seem
to
be
that
as
a
rat
can
not
tell
the
time
of
day
by
a
clock
he
wo
stay
where
he
can
not
find
out
when
dinner
is
ready
november
the
doctor
tells
me
of
several
old
drunkards
one
spiritless
loafer
and
several
moral
wrecks
who
have
been
reclaimed
by
the
salvation
army
and
have
remained
staunch
people
and
hard
workers
these
two
years
wherever
one
goes
these
testimonials
to
the
army
efficiency
are
forthcoming
this
morning
we
had
one
of
those
whizzing
green
ballarat
flies
in
the
room
with
his
stunning
noise
the
swiftest
creature
in
the
world
except
the
it
is
a
stupendous
force
that
is
stored
up
in
that
little
body
if
we
had
it
in
a
ship
in
the
same
proportion
we
could
spin
from
liverpool
to
new
york
in
the
space
of
an
hour
the
time
it
takes
to
eat
luncheon
the
new
zealand
express
train
is
called
the
ballarat
fly
bad
teeth
in
the
colonies
a
citizen
told
me
they
do
have
teeth
filled
but
pull
them
out
and
put
in
false
ones
and
that
now
and
then
one
sees
a
young
lady
with
a
full
set
she
is
fortunate
i
wish
i
had
been
born
with
false
teeth
and
a
false
liver
and
false

december
monday
left
napier
in
the
ballarat
fly
the
one
that
goes
twice
a
week
from
napier
to
hastings
twelve
miles
time
minutes
not
so
far
short
of
thirteen
miles
an
hour
a
perfect
summer
day
cool
breeze
brilliant
sky
rich
vegetation
two
or
three
times
during
the
afternoon
we
saw
wonderfully
dense
and
beautiful
forests
tumultuously
piled
skyward
on
the
broken
highlands
not
the
customary
slant
of
a
hillside
where
the
trees
are
all
the
same
height
the
noblest
of
these
trees
were
of
the
kauri
breed
we
were
told
the
timber
that
is
now
furnishing
the
for
europe
and
is
the
best
of
all
wood
for
that
purpose
sometimes
these
towering
upheavals
of
forestry
were
festooned
and
garlanded
with
and
sometimes
the
masses
of
undergrowth
were
cocooned
in
another
sort
of
vine
of
a
delicate
cobwebby
texture
they
call
it
the
supplejack
i
think
tree
ferns
everywhere
a
stem
fifteen
feet
high
with
a
graceful
chalice
of
sprouting
from
its
top
a
lovely
forest
ornament
and
there
was
a
reed
with
a
flowing
suit
of
what
looked
like
yellow
hair
hanging
from
its
upper
end
i
do
not
know
its
name
but
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
this
is
it
a
romantic
gorge
with
a
brook
flowing
in
its
bottom
approaching
palmerston
north
waitukurau
twenty
minutes
for
luncheon
with
me
sat
my
wife
and
daughter
and
my
manager
carlyle
smythe
i
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
could
see
the
wall
the
others
had
their
backs
to
it
on
that
wall
at
a
good
distance
away
were
a
couple
of
framed
pictures
i
could
not
see
them
clearly
but
from
the
groupings
of
the
figures
i
fancied
that
they
represented
the
killing
of
napoleon
iii
son
by
the
zulus
in
south
africa
i
broke
into
the
conversation
which
was
about
poetry
and
cabbage
and
art
and
said
to
my
wife
do
you
remember
when
the
news
came
to
paris
of
the
killing
of
the
prince
those
were
the
very
words
i
had
in
my
mind
yes
but
what
prince
napoleon
lulu
what
made
you
think
of
that
i
do
know
there
was
no
collusion
she
had
not
seen
the
pictures
and
they
had
not
been
mentioned
she
ought
to
have
thought
of
some
recent
news
that
came
to
paris
for
we
were
but
seven
months
from
there
and
had
been
living
there
a
couple
of
years
when
we
started
on
this
trip
but
instead
of
that
she
thought
of
an
incident
of
our
brief
sojourn
in
paris
of
sixteen
years
before
here
was
a
clear
case
of
mental
telegraphy
of
of
my
mind
telegraphing
a
thought
into
hers
how
do
i
know
because
i
telegraphed
an
error
for
it
turned
out
that
the
pictures
did
not
represent
the
killing
of
lulu
at
all
nor
anything
connected
with
lulu
she
had
to
get
the
error
from
my
head
it
existed
nowhere
else

december
a
pleasant
trip
yesterday
per
ballarat
fly
four
hours
i
do
not
know
the
distance
but
it
must
have
been
well
along
toward
fifty
miles
the
fly
could
have
spun
it
out
to
eight
hours
and
not
discommoded
me
for
where
there
is
comfort
and
no
need
for
hurry
speed
is
of
no
value
at
least
to
me
and
nothing
that
goes
on
wheels
can
be
more
comfortable
more
satisfactory
than
the
new
zealand
trains
outside
of
america
there
are
no
cars
that
are
so
rationally
devised
when
you
add
the
constant
presence
of
charming
scenery
and
the
nearly
constant
absence
of
dust
well
if
one
is
not
content
then
he
ought
to
get
out
and
walk
that
would
change
his
spirit
perhaps
i
think
so
at
the
end
of
an
hour
you
would
find
him
waiting
humbly
beside
the
track
and
glad
to
be
taken
aboard
again
much
horseback
riding
in
and
around
this
town
many
comely
girls
in
cool
and
pretty
summer
gowns
much
salvation
army
lots
of
maoris
the
faces
and
bodies
of
some
of
the
old
ones
very
tastefully
frescoed
maori
council
house
over
the
strong
carpeted
from
end
to
end
with
matting
and
decorated
with
elaborate
wood
carvings
artistically
executed
the
maoris
were
very
polite
i
was
assured
by
a
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
that
the
native
race
is
not
decreasing
but
actually
increasing
slightly
it
is
another
evidence
that
they
are
a
superior
breed
of
savages
i
do
not
call
to
mind
any
savage
race
that
built
such
good
houses
or
such
strong
and
ingenious
and
scientific
fortresses
or
gave
so
much
attention
to
agriculture
or
had
military
arts
and
devices
which
so
nearly
approached
the
white
man
these
taken
together
with
their
high
abilities
in
and
their
tastes
and
capacities
in
the
ornamental
arts
modify
their
savagery
to
a
or
at
least
to
a
it
is
a
compliment
to
them
that
the
british
did
not
exterminate
them
as
they
did
the
australians
and
the
tasmanians
but
were
content
with
subduing
them
and
showed
no
desire
to
go
further
and
it
is
another
compliment
to
them
that
the
british
did
not
take
the
whole
of
their
choicest
lands
but
left
them
a
considerable
part
and
then
went
further
and
protected
them
from
the
rapacities
of
landsharks
a
protection
which
the
new
zealand
government
still
extends
to
them
and
it
is
still
another
compliment
to
the
maoris
that
the
government
allows
native
representation
in
both
the
legislature
and
the
cabinet
and
gives
both
sexes
the
vote
and
in
doing
these
things
the
government
also
compliments
itself
it
has
not
been
the
custom
of
the
world
for
conquerors
to
act
in
this
large
spirit
toward
the
conquered
the
highest
class
white
men
who
lived
among
the
maoris
in
the
earliest
time
had
a
high
opinion
of
them
and
a
strong
affection
for
them
among
the
whites
of
this
sort
was
the
author
of
old
new
zealand
and
campbell
of
auckland
was
another
campbell
was
a
close
friend
of
several
chiefs
and
has
many
pleasant
things
to
say
of
their
fidelity
their
magnanimity
and
their
generosity
also
of
their
quaint
notions
about
the
white
man
queer
civilization
and
their
equally
quaint
comments
upon
it
one
of
them
thought
the
missionary
had
got
everything
wrong
end
first
and
upside
down
why
he
wants
us
to
stop
worshiping
and
supplicating
the
evil
gods
and
go
to
worshiping
and
supplicating
the
good
one
there
is
no
sense
in
that
a
good
god
is
not
going
to
do
us
any
harm
the
maoris
had
the
tabu
and
had
it
on
a
polynesian
scale
of
comprehensiveness
and
elaboration
some
of
its
features
could
have
been
importations
from
india
and
judea
neither
the
maori
nor
the
hindoo
of
common
degree
could
cook
by
a
fire
that
a
person
of
higher
caste
had
used
nor
could
the
high
maori
or
high
hindoo
employ
fire
that
had
served
a
man
of
low
grade
if
a
maori
or
hindoo
drank
from
a
vessel
belonging
to
a
man
the
vessel
was
defiled
and
had
to
be
destroyed
there
were
other
resemblances
between
maori
tabu
and
hindoo
yesterday
a
lunatic
burst
into
my
quarters
and
warned
me
that
the
jesuits
were
going
to
cook
poison
me
in
my
food
or
kill
me
on
the
stage
at
night
he
said
a
mysterious
sign
was
visible
upon
my
posters
and
meant
my
death
he
said
he
saved
rev
haweis
life
by
warning
him
that
there
were
three
men
on
his
platform
who
would
kill
him
if
he
took
his
eyes
off
them
for
a
moment
during
his
lecture
the
same
men
were
in
my
audience
last
night
but
they
saw
that
he
was
there
will
they
be
there
again
he
hesitated
then
said
no
he
thought
they
would
rather
take
a
rest
and
chance
the
poison
this
lunatic
has
no
delicacy
but
he
was
not
uninteresting
he
told
me
a
lot
of
things
he
said
he
had
saved
so
many
lecturers
in
twenty
years
that
they
put
him
in
the
asylum
i
think
he
has
less
refinement
than
any
lunatic
i
have
met
december
a
couple
of
curious
here
at
wanganui
one
is
in
honor
of
white
men
who
fell
in
defence
of
law
and
order
against
fanaticism
and
barbarism
fanaticism
we
americans
are
english
in
blood
english
in
speech
english
in
religion
english
in
the
essentials
of
our
governmental
system
english
in
the
essentials
of
our
civilization
and
so
let
us
hope
for
the
honor
of
the
blend
for
the
honor
of
the
blood
for
the
honor
of
the
race
that
that
word
got
there
through
lack
of
heedfulness
and
will
not
be
suffered
to
remain
if
you
carve
it
at
thermopylae
or
where
winkelried
died
or
upon
bunker
hill
monument
and
read
it
again
who
fell
in
defence
of
law
and
order
against
fanaticism
you
will
perceive
what
the
word
means
and
how
mischosen
it
is
patriotism
is
patriotism
calling
it
fanaticism
can
not
degrade
it
nothing
can
degrade
it
even
though
it
be
a
political
mistake
and
a
thousand
times
a
political
mistake
that
does
not
affect
it
it
is
honorable
always
honorable
always
noble
and
privileged
to
hold
its
head
up
and
look
the
nations
in
the
face
it
is
right
to
praise
these
brave
white
men
who
fell
in
the
maori
war
they
deserve
it
but
the
presence
of
that
word
detracts
from
the
dignity
of
their
cause
and
their
deeds
and
makes
them
appear
to
have
spilt
their
blood
in
a
conflict
with
ignoble
men
men
not
worthy
of
that
costly
sacrifice
but
the
men
were
worthy
it
was
no
shame
to
fight
them
they
fought
for
their
homes
they
fought
for
their
country
they
bravely
fought
and
bravely
fell
and
it
would
take
nothing
from
the
honor
of
the
brave
englishmen
who
lie
under
the
monument
but
add
to
it
to
say
that
they
died
in
defense
of
english
laws
and
english
homes
against
men
worthy
of
the
sacrifice
the
maori
patriots
the
other
monument
can
not
be
rectified
except
with
dynamite
it
is
a
mistake
all
through
and
a
strangely
thoughtless
one
it
is
a
monument
erected
by
white
men
to
maoris
who
fell
fighting
with
the
whites
and
against
their
own
people
in
the
maori
war
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
brave
men
who
fell
on
the
of
may
etc
on
one
side
are
the
names
of
about
twenty
maoris
it
is
not
a
fancy
of
mine
the
monument
exists
i
saw
it
it
is
an
to
the
rising
generation
it
invites
to
treachery
disloyalty
unpatriotism
its
lesson
in
frank
terms
is
desert
your
flag
slay
your
people
burn
their
homes
shame
your
nationality
we
honor
such
december
wellington
ten
hours
from
wanganui
by
the
fly
december
it
is
a
fine
city
and
nobly
situated
a
busy
place
and
full
of
life
and
movement
have
spent
the
three
days
partly
in
walking
about
partly
in
enjoying
social
privileges
and
largely
in
idling
around
the
magnificent
garden
at
hutt
a
little
distance
away
around
the
shore
i
suppose
we
shall
not
see
such
another
one
soon
we
are
packing
for
the
to
australia
our
stay
in
new
zealand
has
been
too
brief
still
we
are
not
unthankful
for
the
glimpse
which
we
have
had
of
it
the
sturdy
maoris
made
the
settlement
of
the
country
by
the
whites
rather
difficult
not
at
first
but
later
at
first
they
welcomed
the
whites
and
were
eager
to
trade
with
them
particularly
for
muskets
for
their
pastime
was
internecine
war
and
they
greatly
preferred
the
white
weapons
to
their
own
war
was
their
pastime
i
use
the
word
advisedly
they
often
met
and
slaughtered
each
other
just
for
a
lark
and
when
there
was
no
quarrel
the
author
of
old
new
zealand
mentions
a
case
where
a
victorious
army
could
have
followed
up
its
advantage
and
exterminated
the
opposing
army
but
declined
to
do
it
explaining
naively
that
if
we
did
that
there
could
be
any
more
fighting
in
another
battle
one
army
sent
word
that
it
was
out
of
ammunition
and
would
be
obliged
to
stop
unless
the
opposing
army
would
send
some
it
was
sent
and
the
fight
went
on
in
the
early
days
things
went
well
enough
the
natives
sold
land
without
clearly
understanding
the
terms
of
exchange
and
the
whites
bought
it
without
being
much
disturbed
about
the
native
confusion
of
mind
but
by
and
by
the
maori
began
to
comprehend
that
he
was
being
wronged
then
there
was
trouble
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
swallow
a
wrong
and
go
aside
and
cry
about
it
he
had
the
tasmanian
spirit
and
endurance
and
a
notable
share
of
military
science
besides
and
so
he
rose
against
the
oppressor
did
this
gallant
fanatic
and
started
a
war
that
was
not
brought
to
a
definite
end
until
more
than
a
generation
had
sped

at

poetry
i
have
been
reading
the

of

again
and
i
find
in
them
the
same
grace
and
melody
that
attracted
me
when
they
were
first
published
twenty
years
ago
and
have
held
me
in
happy
bonds
ever
since
the
sentimental
song
book
has
long
been
out
of
print
and
has
been
forgotten
by
the

not
by

carry
it
with

it
and

deathless

indeed
it
has
the
same
deep
charm
for
me
that
the
vicar
of
wakefield
has
and
i
find
in
it
the
same
subtle
touch
the
touch
that
makes
an
intentionally
humorous
episode
pathetic
and
an
intentionally
pathetic
one
funny
in
her
time
moore
was
called
the
sweet
singer
of
michigan
and
was
best
known
by
that
name
i
have
read
her
book
through
twice
today
with
the
purpose
of
determining
which
of
her
pieces
has
most
merit
and
i
am
persuaded
that
for
wide
grasp
and
sustained
power
william

may
claim
first
place
william

the

come
all
good
people
far
and

oh
come
and
see
what
you
can
hear
it
of
a
young
man
true
and
brave
that
is
now
sleeping
in
his
grave
now
william
upson
was
his
name
if
it
not
that
it
all
the
same
he
did
enlist
in
a
cruel
strife
and
it
caused
him
to
lose
his
life
he
was
perry
upson
eldest
son
his
father
loved
his
noble
son
this
son
was
nineteen
years
of
age
when
first
in
the
rebellion
he
engaged
his
father
said
that
he
might
go
but
his
dear
mother
she
said
no
oh
stay
at
home
dear
billy
she
said
but
she
could
not
turn
his
head
he
went
to
nashville
in
tennessee
there
his
kind
friends
he
could
not
see
he
died
among
strangers
so
far
away
they
did
not
know
where
his
body
lay
he
was
taken
sick
and
lived
four
weeks
and
oh
how
his
parents
weep
but
now
they
must
in
sorrow
mourn
for
billy
has
gone
to
his
heavenly
home
oh
if
his
mother
could
have
seen
her
son
for
she
loved
him
her
darling
son
if
she
could
heard
his
dying
prayer
it
would
ease
her
heart
till
she
met
him
there
how
it
would
relieve
his
mother
heart
to
see
her
son
from
this
world
depart
and
hear
his
noble
words
of
love
as
he
left
this

heart

laid

for
now
she
knows
that
his

she

many
tears
although
she

not
that
it

his

it

his
noble
face
december
reached
sydney
december
in
the
train
fellow
of
with
four
valises
a
slim
creature
with
teeth
which
made
his
mouth
look
like
a
neglected
churchyard
he
had
solidified
hair
solidified
with
pomatum
it
was
all
one
shell
he
smoked
the
most
extraordinary
cigarettes
made
of
some
kind
of
manure
apparently
these
and
his
hair
made
him
smell
like
the
very
nation
he
had
a
vest
on
which
exposed
a
deal
of
frayed
and
broken
and
unclean
shirtfront
showy
studs
of
imitation
gold
they
had
made
black
disks
on
the
linen
oversized
sleeve
buttons
of
imitation
gold
the
copper
base
showing
through
ponderous
of
imitation
gold
i
judge
that
he
could
tell
the
time
by
it
for
he
asked
smythe
what
time
it
was
once
he
wore
a
coat
which
had
been
gay
when
it
was
young
of
a
light
tint
and
marvelously
soiled
yellow
mustache
with
a
dashing
upward
whirl
at
the
ends
foxy
shoes
imitation
patent
leather
he
was
a
novelty
an
imitation
dude
he
would
have
been
a
real
one
if
he
could
have
afforded
it
but
he
was
satisfied
with
himself
you
could
see
it
in
his
expression
and
in
all
his
attitudes
and
movements
he
was
living
in
a
dude
dreamland
where
all
his
squalid
shams
were
genuine
and
himself
a
sincerity
it
disarmed
criticism
it
mollified
spite
to
see
him
so
enjoy
his
imitation
languors
and
arts
and
airs
and
his
studied
daintinesses
of
gesture
and
misbegotten
refinements
it
was
plain
to
me
that
he
was
imagining
himself
the
prince
of
wales
and
was
doing
everything
the
way
he
thought
the
prince
would
do
it
for
bringing
his
four
valises
aboard
and
stowing
them
in
the
nettings
he
gave
his
porter
four
cents
and
lightly
apologized
for
the
smallness
of
the
gratuity
just
with
the
condescendingest
little
royal
air
in
the
world
he
stretched
himself
out
on
the
front
seat
and
rested
his
on
the
middle
arm
and
stuck
his
feet
out
of
the
window
and
began
to
pose
as
the
prince
and
work
his
dreams
and
languors
for
exhibition
and
he
would
indolently
watch
the
blue
films
curling
up
from
his
cigarette
and
inhale
the
stench
and
look
so
grateful
and
would
flip
the
ash
away
with
the
daintiest
gesture
unintentionally
displaying
his
brass
ring
in
the
most
intentional
way
why
it
was
as
good
as
being
in
marlborough
house
itself
to
see
him
do
it
so
like
there
was
other
scenery
in
the
trip
that
of
the
hawksbury
river
in
the
national
park
region
fine
extraordinarily
fine
with
spacious
views
of
stream
and
lake
imposingly
framed
in
woody
hills
and
every
now
and
then
the
noblest
groupings
of
mountains
and
the
most
enchanting
rearrangements
of
the
water
effects
further
along
green
flats
thinly
covered
with
gum
forests
with
here
and
there
the
huts
and
cabins
of
small

engaged
in

among

i

ever

there
are
in
the
list
i
did
not
need
them
all
but
i
have
knocked
down
of
them
which
is
a
good
bag
it
seems
to
me
for
a
person
not
in
the
business
perhaps
a
poet
laureate
could
do
better
but
a
poet
laureate
gets
wages
and
that
is
different
when
i
write
poetry
i
do
not
get
any
wages
often
i
lose

by
it
the
best
word
in
that
list
and
the
most
musical

gurgly
is

but
are
said
to
go
into
hopeless

when
there
is

they
are
from
bombay
and
the
coast
thereabouts
left
some
of
the
trunks
in
sydney
to
be
shipped
to
south
africa
by
a
vessel
advertised
to
sail
three
months
hence
the
proverb
says
separate
not
yourself
from

this
is
a
stately

luxuriously
appointed

has
spacious

surpassingly
comfortable

three
big
cats
very
friendly
loafers
they
wander
all
over
the

the
white
one
follows
the
chief
steward
around
like
a
dog
there
is
also
a
basket
of
kittens
one
of
these
cats
goes
ashore
in
port
in
england
australia
and
india
to
see
how
his
various
families
are
getting
along
and
is
seen
no
more
till
the
ship
is
ready
to
sail
no
one
knows
how
he
finds
out
the
sailing
date
but
no
doubt
he
comes
down
to
the
dock
every
day
and
takes
a
look
and
when
he
sees
baggage
and
passengers
flocking
in
recognizes
that
it
is
time
to
get
aboard
this
is
what
the
sailors
believe
the
chief
engineer
has
been
in
the
china
and
india
trade
thirty
three
years
and
has
had
but
three
christmases
at
home
in
that
time
conversational
items
at
dinner
mocha
sold
all
over
the
world
it
is
not
true
in
fact
very
few
foreigners
except
the
emperor
of
russia
have
ever
seen
a
grain
of
it
or
ever
will
while
they
live
another
man
said
there
is
no
sale
in
australia
for
australian
wine
but
it
goes
to
france
and
comes
back
with
a
french
label
on
it
and
then
they
buy
it
i
have
heard
that
the
most
of
the
claret
in
new
york
is
made
in
california
and
i
remember
what
professor
told
me
once
about
veuve
cliquot
if
that
was
the
wine
and
i
think
it
was
he
was
the
guest
of
a
great
wine
merchant
whose
town
was
quite
near
that
vineyard
and
this
merchant
asked
him
if
very
much
was
drunk
in
america
oh
yes
said
a
great
abundance
of
it
is
it
easy
to
be
had
oh
yes
easy
as
water
all
first
and
hotels
have
it
what
do
you
pay
for
it
it
depends
on
the
style
of
the
hotel
from
fifteen
to
francs
a
bottle
oh
fortunate
country
why
it
worth
francs
right
here
on
the
ground
no
yes
do
you
mean
that
we
are
drinking
a
bogus
over
there
yes
and
there
was
never
a
bottle
of
the
genuine
in
america
since
columbus
time
that
wine
all
comes
from
a
little
bit
of
a
patch
of
ground
which
is
big
enough
to
raise
many
bottles
and
all
of
it
that
is
produced
goes
every
year
to
one
person
the
emperor
of
russia
he
takes
the
whole
crop
in
advance
be
it
big
or
little

up
the

we
were
in
a
small
deep
puddle
with
a
narrow
channel
leading
out
of
it
minutely
buoyed
to
the
sea
i
stayed
on
deck
to
see
how
we
were
going
to
manage
it
with
such
a
big
ship
and
such
a
strong
wind
on
the

giant

a
brilliant
crowd
of
lascars
standing
by
for

our
stern
was
pointing
straight
at
the
head
of
the
channel
so
we
must
turn
entirely
around
in
the
puddle
and
the
wind
blowing
as
described
it
was
done
and
beautifully
it
was
done
by
help
of
a
jib
we
stirred
up
much
mud
but
did
not
touch
the
bottom
we
turned
right
around
in

news
comes
that
within
this
week
siam
has
acknowledged
herself
to
be
in
effect
a
french
province
it
seems
plain
that
all
savage
and
countries
are
going
to
be
grabbed
a
vulture
on
board
bald
red
head
featherless
red
places
here
and
there
on
his
body
intense
great
black
eyes
set
in
featherless
rims
of
inflamed
flesh
dissipated
look
a
businesslike
style
a
selfish
conscienceless
murderous
aspect
the
very
look
of
a
professional
assassin
and
yet
a
bird
which
does
no
murder
what
was
the
use
of
getting
him
up
in
that
tragic
style
for
so
innocent
a
trade
as
his
for
this
one
is
the
sort
that
wars
upon
the
living
his
diet
is
offal
and
the
more
out
of
date
it
is
the
better
he
likes
it
nature
should
give
him
a
suit
of
rusty
black
then
he
would
be
all
right
for
he
would
look
like
an
undertaker
and
would
harmonize
with
his
business
whereas
the
way
he
is
now
he
is
horribly
out
of
true
january
at
this
morning
we
passed
cape
leeuwin
lioness
and
ceased
from
our
long
course
along
the
southern
shore
of
australia
turning
this
extreme
southwestern
corner
we
now
take
a
long
straight
slant
nearly
without
a
break
for
ceylon
as
we
speed
northward
it
will
grow
hotter
very
fast
but
it
is
chilly
now
the
vulture
is
from
the
public
menagerie
at
adelaide
a
great
and
interesting
collection
it
was
there
that
we
saw
the
baby
tiger
solemnly
spreading
its
mouth
and
trying
to
roar
like
its
majestic
mother
it
swaggered
scowling
back
and
forth
on
its
short
legs
just
as
it
had
seen
her
do
on
her
long
ones
and
now
and
then
snarling
viciously
exposing
its
teeth
with
a
threatening
lift
of
its
upper
lip
and
bristling
moustache
and
when
it
thought
it
was
impressing
the
visitors
it
would
spread
its
mouth
wide
and
do
that
screechy
cry
which
it
meant
for
a
roar
but
which
did
not
deceive
it
took
itself
quite
seriously
and
was
lovably
comical
and
there
was
a
hyena
an
ugly
creature
as
ugly
as
the
was
pretty
it
repeatedly
arched
its
back
and
delivered
itself
of
such
a
human
cry
a
startling
resemblance
a
cry
which
was
just
that
of
a
grown
person
badly
hurt
in
the
dark
one
would
assuredly
go
to
its
assistance
and
be
disappointed
many
friends
of
australasian
federation
on
board
they
feel
sure
that
the
good
day
is
not
far
off
now
but
there
seems
to
be
a
party
that
would
go
further
have
australasia
cut
loose
from
the
british
empire
and
set
up
housekeeping
on
her
own
hook
it
seems
an
unwise
idea
they

to
me
that

a
good

of
being
alike
australasia
governs
herself
wholly
there
is
no
interference
and
her
commerce
and
manufactures
are
not
oppressed
in
any
way
if
our
case
had
been
the
same
we
should
not
have
gone
out

we
did
january
unspeakably
hot
the
equator
is
arriving
again
we
are
within
eight
degrees
of
it
ceylon
present
dear
me
it
is
beautiful
and
most
sumptuously
tropical
as
to
character
of
foliage
and
opulence
of
it

though

spicy

an
eloquent
line
an
incomparable
line
it
says
little
but
conveys
whole
libraries
of
sentiment
and
oriental
charm
and
mystery
and
tropic
deliciousness
a
line
that
quivers
and
tingles
with
a
thousand
unexpressed
and
inexpressible
things
things
that
haunt
one
and
find
no
articulate

colombo
the
capital
an
oriental
town
most
manifestly
and
fascinating
in
this
palatial
ship
the
passengers
dress
for
dinner
the
toilettes
make
a
fine
display
of
color
and
this
is
in
keeping
with
the
elegance
of
the
vessel
furnishings
and
the
flooding
brilliancies
of
the
electric
light
on
the
stormy
atlantic
one
never
sees
a
man
in
evening
dress
except
at
the
rarest
intervals
and
then
there
is
only
one
not
two
and
he
shows
up
but
once
on
the
voyage
the
night
before
the
ship
makes
port
the
night
when
they
have
the
concert
and
do
the
amateur
wailings
and
recitations
he
is
the
tenor
as
a
rule
there
has
been
a
deal
of
on
board
it
seems
a
queer
game
for
a
ship
but
they
enclose
the
promenade
deck
with
nettings
and
keep
the
ball
from
flying
overboard
and
the
sport
goes
very
well

is

winning
young

combed

knotted
at
the

from

quite
unmasculine
it
was
an
embarrassment
to
undress
before
him
we
drove
to
the
market
using
the
japanese
jinriksha
our
first
acquaintanceship
with
it
it
is
a
light
cart
with
a
native
to
draw
it
he
makes
good
speed
for
but
it
is
hard
work
for
him
he
is
too
slight
for
it
after
the
there
is
no
more
pleasure
for
you
your
attention
is
all
on
the
man
just
as
it
would
be
on
a
tired
horse
and
necessarily
your
sympathy
is
there
too
there
a
plenty
of
these
and
the
tariff
is
incredibly
cheap
i
was
in
cairo
years
ago
that
was
oriental
but
there
was
a
lack
when
you
are
in
florida
or
new
orleans
you
are
in
the
south
that
is
granted
but
you
are
not
in
the
south
you
are
in
a
modified
south
a
tempered
south
cairo
was
a
tempered
orient
an
orient
with
an
indefinite
something
wanting
that
feeling
was
not
present
in
ceylon
ceylon
was
oriental
in
the
last
measure
of
completeness
utterly
oriental
also
utterly
tropical
and
indeed
to
one
unreasoning
spiritual
sense
the
two
things
belong
together
all
the
requisites
were
present
the
costumes
were
right
the
black
and
brown
exposures
unconscious
of
immodesty
were
right
the
juggler
was
there
with
his
basket
his
snakes
his
mongoose
and
his
arrangements
for
growing
a
tree
from
seed
to
foliage
and
ripe
fruitage
before
one
eyes
in
sight
were
plants
and
flowers
familiar
to
one
on
books
but
in
no
other
way
celebrated
desirable
strange
but
in
production
restricted
to
the
hot
belt
of
the
equator
and
out
a
little
way
in
the
country
were
the
proper
deadly
snakes
and
fierce
beasts
of
prey
and
the
wild
elephant
and
the
monkey
and
there
was
that
swoon
in
the
air
which
one
associates
with
the
tropics
and
that
smother
of
heat
heavy
with
odors
of
unknown
flowers
and
that
sudden
invasion
of
purple
gloom
fissured
with
lightnings
then
the
tumult
of
crashing
thunder
and
the
downpour
and
presently
all
sunny
and
smiling
again
all
these
things
were
there
the
conditions
were
complete
nothing
was
lacking
and
away
off
in
the
deeps
of
the
jungle
and
in
the
remotenesses
of
the
mountains
were
the
ruined
cities
and
mouldering
temples
mysterious
relics
of
the
pomps
of
a
forgotten
time
and
a
vanished
race
and
this
was
as
it
should
be
also
for
nothing
is
quite
satisfyingly
oriental
that
lacks
the
somber
and
impressive
qualities
of
mystery
and
antiquity
the
drive
through
the
town
and
out
to
the
galle
face
by
the
seashore
what
a
dream
it
was
of
tropical
splendors
of
bloom
and
blossom
and
oriental
conflagrations
of
costume
the
walking
groups
of
men
women
boys
girls
babies
each
individual
was
a
flame
each
group
a
house
afire
for
color
and
such
stunning
colors
such
intensely
vivid
colors
such
rich
and
exquisite
minglings
and
fusings
of
rainbows
and
lightnings
and
all
harmonious
all
in
perfect
taste
never
a
discordant
note
never
a
color
on
any
person
swearing
at
another
color
on
him
or
failing
to
harmonize
faultlessly
with
the
colors
of
any
group
the
wearer
might
join
the
stuffs
were
soft
delicate
clinging
and
as
a
rule
each
piece
a
solid
color
a
splendid
green
a
splendid
blue
a
splendid
yellow
a
splendid
purple
a
splendid
ruby
deep
and
rich
with
smouldering
fires
they
swept
continuously
by
in
crowds
and
legions
and
multitudes
glowing
flashing
burning
radiant
and
every
five
seconds
came
a
burst
of
blinding
red
that
made
a
body
catch
his
breath
and
filled
his
heart
with
joy
and
then
the
unimaginable
grace
of
those
costumes
sometimes
a
woman
whole
dress
was
but
a
scarf
wound
about
her
person
and
her
head
sometimes
a
man
was
but
a
turban
and
a
careless
rag
or
two
in
both
cases
generous
areas
of
polished
dark
skin
showing
but
always
the
arrangement
compelled
the
homage
of
the
eye
and
made
the
heart
sing
for
gladness
i
can
see
it
to
this
day
that
radiant
panorama
that
wilderness
of
rich
color
that
incomparable
of
harmonious
tints
and
lithe
forms
and
beautiful
brown
faces
and
gracious
and
graceful
gestures
and
attitudes
and
movements
free
unstudied
barren
of
stiffness
and
restraint
and
just
then
into
this
dream
of
fairyland
and
paradise
a
grating
dissonance
was
injected
out
of
a
missionary
school
came
marching
two
and
two
sixteen
prim
and
pious
little
christian
black
girls
europeanly
clothed
dressed
to
the
last
detail
as
they
would
have
been
dressed
on
a
summer
sunday
in
an
english
or
american
village
those
clothes
oh
they
were
unspeakably
ugly
ugly
barbarous
destitute
of
taste
destitute
of
grace
repulsive
as
a
shroud
i
looked
at
my
womenfolk
clothes
just
duplicates
of
the
outrages
disguising
those
poor
little
abused
creatures
and
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
with
them
then
i
looked
at
my
own
clothes
and
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
the
street
with
myself
however
we
must
put
up
with
our
clothes
as
they
are
they
have
their
reason
for
existing
they
are
on
us
to
expose
us
to
advertise
what
we
wear
them
to
conceal
they
are
a
sign
a
sign
of
insincerity
a
sign
of
suppressed
vanity
a
pretense
that
we
despise
gorgeous
colors
and
the
graces
of
harmony
and
form
and
we
put
them
on
to
propagate
that
lie
and
back
it
up
but
we
do
not
deceive
our
neighbor
and
when
we
step
into
ceylon
we
realize
that
we
have
not
even
deceived
ourselves
we
do
love
brilliant
colors
and
graceful
costumes
and
at
home
we
will
turn
out
in
a
storm
to
see
them
when
the
procession
goes
by
and
envy
the
wearers
we
go
to
the
theater
to
look
at
them
and
grieve
that
we
ca
be
clothed
like
that
we
go
to
the
king
ball
when
we
get
a
chance
and
are
glad
of
a
sight
of
the
splendid
uniforms
and
the
glittering
orders
when
we
are
granted
permission
to
attend
an
imperial
we
shut
ourselves
up
in
private
and
parade
around
in
the
theatrical
by
the
hour
and
admire
ourselves
in
the
glass
and
are
utterly
happy
and
every
member
of
every
governor
staff
in
democratic
america
does
the
same
with
his
grand
new
uniform
and
if
he
is
not
watched
he
will
get
himself
photographed
in
it
too
when
i
see
the
lord
mayor
footman
i
am
dissatisfied
with
my
lot
yes
our
clothes
are
a
lie
and
have
been
nothing
short
of
that
these
hundred
years
they
are
insincere
they
are
the
ugly
and
appropriate
outward
exposure
of
an
inward
sham
and
a
moral
decay
the
last
little
brown
boy
i
chanced
to
notice
in
the
crowds
and
swarms
of
colombo
had
nothing
on
but
a
twine
string
around
his
waist
but
in
my
memory
the
frank
honesty
of
his
costume
still
stands
out
in
pleasant
contrast
with
the
odious
flummery
in
which
the
little
dowdies
were
masquerading

running
up

closing
up
on

to
arrive
this
evening
january
bombay
a
bewitching
place
a
bewildering
place
an
enchanting
place
the
arabian
nights
come
again
it
is
a
vast
city
contains
about
a
million
inhabitants
natives
they
are
with
a
slight
sprinkling
of
white
people
not
enough
to
have
the
slightest
modifying
effect
upon
the
massed
dark
complexion
of
the
public
it
is
winter
here
yet
the
weather
is
the
divine
weather
of
june
and
the
foliage
is
the
fresh
and
heavenly
foliage
of
june
there
is
a
rank
of
noble
great
shade
trees
across
the
way
from
the
hotel
and
under
them
sit
groups
of
picturesque
natives
of
both
sexes
and
the
juggler
in
his
turban
is
there
with
his
snakes
and
his
magic
and
all
day
long
the
cabs
and
the
multitudinous
varieties
of
costumes
flock
by
it
does
not
seem
as
if
one
could
ever
get
tired
of
watching
this
moving
show
this
shining
and
shifting
spectacle
in
the
great
bazar
the
pack
and
jam
of
natives
was
marvelous
the
sea
of
turbans
and
draperies
an
inspiring
sight
and
the
quaint
and
showy
indian
architecture
was
just
the
right
setting
for
it
toward
sunset
another
show
this
is
the
drive
around
the
to

point
where
lord
sandhurst
the
governor
of
the
bombay
presidency
lives
parsee
palaces
all
along
the
first
part
of
the
drive
and
past
them
all
the
world
is
driving
the
private
carriages
of
wealthy
englishmen
and
natives
of
rank
are
manned
by
a
driver
and
three
footmen
in
stunning
oriental
liveries
two
of
these
turbaned
statues
standing
up
behind
as
fine
as
monuments
sometimes
even
the
public
carriages
have
this
superabundant
crew
slightly
modified
one
to
drive
one
to
sit
by
and
see
it
done
and
one
to
stand
up
behind
and
yell
yell
when
there
is
anybody
in
the
way
and
for
practice
when
there
is
it
all
helps
to
keep
up
the
liveliness
and
augment
the
general
sense
of
swiftness
and
energy
and
confusion
and
in
the
region

there
are

the
other
the
passing
and

and

is

his

a
deep
dark
brown
his

his
rounded

knobbing
it

if
it
had

under

the
woman
is
a
slender
and
shapely
creature
as
erect
as
a
and
she
has
but
one
thing
on
a
piece
of
stuff
which
is
wound
about
her
head
and
her
body
down
nearly
to
her
knees
and
which
clings
like
her
own
skin
her
legs
and
feet
are
bare
and
so
are
her
arms
except
for
her
fanciful
bunches
of
loose
silver
rings
on
her
ankles
and
on
her
arms
she
has
jewelry
bunched
on
the
side
of
her
nose
also
and
showy
clusterings
on
her
toes
when
she
undresses
for
bed
she
takes
off
her
jewelry
i
suppose
if
she
took
off
anything
more
she
would
catch
cold
as
a
rule
she
has
a
large
shiney
brass
water
jar
of
graceful
shape
on
her
head
and
one
of
her
naked
arms
curves
up
and
the
hand
holds
it
there
she
is
so
straight
so
erect
and
she
steps
with
such
style
and
such
easy
grace
and
dignity
and
her
curved
arm
and
her
brazen
jar
are
such
a
help
to
the
picture
indeed

did
not

for

it
began
at

straight
away
the
lobbies
and
halls
were
full
of
turbaned
and
and
embroidered
cap
and
barefooted
and
dark
natives
some
of
them
rushing
about
others
at
rest
squatting
or
sitting
on

of
them
chattering
with
energy
others

standing
behind
his

and
dressed
for
a
part
in
the
arabian
nights
our
rooms
were
high
up
on
the
front
a
white
man
he
was
a
burly
german
went
up
with
us
and
brought
three
natives
along
to
see
to
arranging
things
about
fourteen
others
followed
in
procession
with
the
each
carried
an
article
and
only
one
a
bag
in
some
cases
in
other
cases
less
one
strong
native
carried
my
overcoat
another
a
parasol
another
a
box
of
cigars
another
a

and
the
last
man
in
the
procession
had
no
load
but
a
fan
it
was
all
done
with
earnestness
and
sincerity
there
was
not
a
smile
in
the
procession
from
the
head
of
it
to
the
tail
of
it
each
man
waited
patiently
tranquilly
in
no
sort
of
hurry
till
one
of
us
found
time
to
give
him
a
copper
then
he
bent
his
head
reverently
touched
his
forehead
with
his
fingers
and
went
his
way
they
seemed
a
soft
and
gentle
race
and
there
was
something
both
winning
and
touching
about
their
demeanor
there
was
a
vast
glazed
door
which
opened
upon
the
balcony
it
needed
closing
or
cleaning
or
something
and
a
native
got
down
on
his
knees
and
went
to
work
at
it
he
seemed
to
be
doing
it
well
enough
but
perhaps
he
was
for
the
burly
german
put
on
a
look
that
betrayed
dissatisfaction
then
without
explaining
what
was
wrong
gave
the
native
a
brisk
cuff
on
the
jaw
and
then
told
him
where
the
defect
was
it
seemed
such
a
shame
to
do
that
before
us
all
the
native
took
it
with
meekness
saying
nothing
and
not
showing
in
his
face
or
manner
any
resentment
i
had
not
seen
the
like
of
this
for
fifty
years
it
carried
me
back
to
my
boyhood
and
flashed
upon
me
the
forgotten
fact
that
this
was
the
usual
way
of
explaining
one
desires
to
a
slave
i
was
able
to
remember
that
the
method
seemed
right
and
natural
to
me
in
those
days
i
being
born
to
it
and
unaware
that
elsewhere
there
were
other
methods
but
i
was
also
able
to
remember
that
those
unresented
cuffings
made
me
sorry
for
the
victim
and
ashamed
for
the
punisher
my
father
was
a
refined
and
kindly
gentleman
very
grave
rather
austere
of
rigid
probity
a
sternly
just
and
upright
man
albeit
he
attended
no
church
and
never
spoke
of
religious
matters
and
had
no
part
nor
lot
in
the
pious
joys
of
his
presbyterian
family
nor
ever
seemed
to
suffer
from
this
deprivation
he
laid
his
hand
upon
me
in
punishment
only
twice
in
his
life
and
then
not
heavily
once
for
telling
him
a
lie
which
surprised
me
and
showed
me
how
unsuspicious
he
was
for
that
was
not
my
maiden
effort
he
punished
me
those
two
times
only
and
never
any
other
member
of
the
family
at
all
yet
every
now
and
then
he
cuffed
our
harmless
slave
boy
lewis
for
trifling
little
blunders
and
awkwardnesses
my
father
had
passed
his
life
among
the
slaves
from
his
cradle
up
and
his
cuffings
proceeded
from
the
custom
of
the
time
not
from
his
nature
when
i
was
ten
years
old
i
saw
a
man
fling
a
lump
of
at
a
slaveman
in
anger
for
merely
doing
something
awkwardly
as
if
that
were
a
crime
it
bounded
from
the
skull
and
the
man
fell
and
never
spoke
again
he
was
dead
in
an
hour
i
knew
the
man
had
a
right
to
kill
his
slave
if
he
wanted
to
and
yet
it
seemed
a
pitiful
thing
and
somehow
wrong
though
why
wrong
i
was
not
deep
enough
to
explain
if
i
had
been
asked
to
do
it
nobody
in
the
village
approved
of
that
murder
but
of
course
no
one
said
much
about
it
it
is
curious
the
power
of
thought
for
just
one
second
all
that
goes
to
make
the
me
in
me
was
in
a
missourian
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
vividly
seeing
again
these
forgotten
pictures
of
fifty
years
ago
and
wholly
unconscious
of
all
things
but
just
those
and
in
the
next
second
i
was
back
in
bombay
and
that
kneeling
native
smitten
cheek
was
not
done
tingling
yet
back
to
boyhood
fifty
years
back
to
age
again
another
fifty
and
a
flight
equal
to
the
circumference
of
the
in
two
seconds
by
the
watch
some
natives
i
do
remember
how
many
went
into
my
bedroom
now
and
put
things
to
rights
and
arranged
the
and
i
went
to
bed
to
nurse
my
cough
it
was
about
nine
in
the
evening
what
a
state
of
things
for
three
hours
the
yelling
and
shouting
of
natives
in
the
hall
continued
along
with
the
velvety
patter
of
their
swift
bare
feet
what
a
racket
it
was
they
were
yelling
orders
and
messages
down
three
flights
why
in
the
matter
of
noise
it
amounted
to
a
riot
an
insurrection
a
revolution
and
then
there
were
other
noises
mixed
up
with
these
and
at
intervals
tremendously
accenting
them
roofs
falling
in
i
judged
windows
smashing
persons
being
murdered
crows
squawking
and
deriding
and
cursing
canaries
screeching
monkeys
jabbering
macaws
blaspheming
and
every
now
and
then
fiendish
bursts
of
laughter
and
explosions
of
dynamite
by
midnight
i
had
suffered
all
the
different
kinds
of
shocks
there
are
and
knew
that
i
could
never
more
be
disturbed
by
them
either
isolated
or
in
combination
then
came
peace
stillness
deep
and
solemn
and
lasted
till
five
then
it
all
broke
loose
again
and
who
it
the
bird
of
birds
the
indian
crow
i
came
to
know
him
well
by
and
by
and
be
infatuated
with
him
i
suppose
he
is
the
hardest
lot
that
wears
feathers
yes
and
the
cheerfulest
and
the
best
satisfied
with
himself
he
never
arrived
at
what
he
is
by
any
careless
process
or
any
sudden
one
he
is
a
work
of
art
and
art
is
long
he
is
the
product
of
immemorial
ages
and
of
deep
calculation
one
ca
make
a
bird
like
that
in
a
day
he
has
been
reincarnated
more
times
than
shiva
and
he
has
kept
a
sample
of
each
incarnation
and
fused
it
into
his
constitution
in
the
course
of
his
evolutionary
promotions
his
sublime
march
toward
ultimate
perfection
he
has
been
a
gambler
a
low
comedian
a
dissolute
priest
a
fussy
woman
a
blackguard
a
scoffer
a
liar
a
thief
a
spy
an
informer
a
trading
politician
a
swindler
a
professional
hypocrite
a
patriot
for
cash
a
reformer
a
lecturer
a
lawyer
a
conspirator
a
rebel
a
royalist
a
democrat
a
practicer
and
propagator
of
irreverence
a
meddler
an
intruder
a
busybody
an
infidel
and
a
wallower
in
sin
for
the
mere
love
of
it
the
strange
result
the
incredible
result
of
this
patient
accumulation
of
all
damnable
traits
is
that
be
does
not
know
what
care
is
he
does
not
know
what
sorrow
is
he
does
not
know
what
remorse
is
his
life
is
one
long
thundering
ecstasy
of
happiness
and
he
will
go
to
his
death
untroubled
knowing
that
he
will
soon
turn
up
again
as
an
author
or
something
and
be
even
more
intolerably
capable
and
comfortable
than
ever
he
was
before
in
his
straddling
wide
and
his
springy
series
of
hops
and
his
impudent
air
and
his
cunning
way
of
canting
his
head
to
one
side
upon
occasion
he
reminds
one
of
the
american
blackbird
but
the
sharp
resemblances
stop
there
he
is
much
bigger
than
the
blackbird
and
he
lacks
the
blackbird
trim
and
slender
and
beautiful
build
and
shapely
beak
and
of
course
his
sober
garb
of
gray
and
rusty
black
is
a
poor
and
humble
thing
compared
with
the
splendid
lustre
of
the
blackbird
metallic
sables
and
shifting
and
flashing
bronze
glories
the
blackbird
is
a
perfect
gentleman
in
deportment
and
attire
and
is
not
noisy
i
believe
except
when
holding
religious
services
and
political
conventions
in
a
tree
but
this
indian
sham
quaker
is
just
a
rowdy
and
is
always
noisy
when
awake
always
chaffing
scolding
scoffing
laughing
ripping
and
cursing
and
carrying
on
about
something
or
other
i
never
saw
such
a
bird
for
delivering
opinions
nothing
escapes
him
he
notices
everything
that
happens
and
brings
out
his
opinion
about
it
particularly
if
it
is
a
matter
that
is
none
of
his
business
and
it
is
never
a
mild
opinion
but
always
violent
violent
and
profane
the
presence
of
ladies
does
not
affect
him
his
opinions
are
not
the
outcome
of
reflection
for
he
never
thinks
about
anything
but
heaves
out
the
opinion
that
is
on
top
in
his
mind
and
which
is
often
an
opinion
about
some
quite
different
thing
and
does
not
fit
the
case
but
that
is
his
way
his
main
idea
is
to
get
out
an
opinion
and
if
he
stopped
to
think
he
would
lose
chances
i
suppose
he
has
no
enemies
among
men
the
whites
and
mohammedans
never
seemed
to
molest
him
and
the
hindoos
because
of
their
religion
never
take
the
life
of
any
creature
but
spare
even
the
snakes
and
tigers
and
fleas
and
rats
if
i
sat
on
one
end
of
the
balcony
the
crows
would
gather
on
the
railing
at
the
other
end
and
talk
about
me
and
edge
closer
little
by
little
till
i
could
almost
reach
them
and
they
would
sit
there
in
the
most
unabashed
way
and
talk
about
my
clothes
and
my
hair
and
my
complexion
and
probable
character
and
vocation
and
politics
and
how
i
came
to
be
in
india
and
what
i
had
been
doing
and
how
many
days
i
had
got
for
it
and
how
i
had
happened
to
go
unhanged
so
long
and
when
would
it
probably
come
off
and
might
there
be
more
of
my
sort
where
i
came
from
and
when
would
they
be
hanged
and
so
on
and
so
on
until
i
could
not
longer
endure
the
embarrassment
of
it
then
i
would
shoo
them
away
and
they
would
circle
around
in
the
air
a
little
while
laughing
and
deriding
and
mocking
and
presently
settle
on
the
rail
and
do
it
all
over
again
they
were
very
sociable
when
there
was
anything
to
eat
oppressively
so
with
a
little
encouragement
they
would
come
in
and
light
on
the
table
and
help
me
eat
my
breakfast
and
once
when
i
was
in
the
other
room
and
they
found
themselves
alone
they
carried
off
everything
they
could
lift
and
they
were
particular
to
choose
things
which
they
could
make
no
use
of
after
they
got
them
in
india
their
number
is
beyond
estimate
and
their
noise
is
in
proportion
i
suppose
they
cost
the
country
more
than
the
government
does
yet
that
is
not
a
light
matter
still
they
pay
their
company
pays
it
would
sadden
the
land
to
take
their
cheerful
voice
out
of
it
