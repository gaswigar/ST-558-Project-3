my
fair
neighbour
mashi
i
the
maternal
aunt
is
addressed
as
mashi
to
sleep
jotin
it
is
getting
late
mind
if
it
is
i
have
not
many
days
left
i
was
thinking
that
mani
should
go
to
her
father
i
forget
where
he
is
now
yes
sitarampur
send
her
there
she
should
not
remain
any
longer
near
a
sick
man
she
herself
is
not
strong
listen
to
him
how
can
she
bear
to
leave
you
in
this
state
she
know
what
the
doctors
she
can
see
for
herself
the
other
day
she
cried
her
eyes
out
at
the
merest
hint
of
having
to
go
to
her
father
house
we
must
explain
that
in
this
statement
there
was
a
slight
distortion
of
truth
to
say
the
least
of
it
the
actual
talk
with
mani
was
as
follows
suppose
my
child
you
have
got
some
news
from
your
father
i
thought
i
saw
your
cousin
anath
here
next
friday
will
be
my
little
sister
ceremony
so
i
thinking
the
ceremony
takes
place
when
a
child
is
first
given
rice
usually
it
receives
its
name
on
that
day
right
my
dear
send
her
a
gold
necklace
it
will
please
your
mother
thinking
of
going
myself
i
never
seen
my
little
sister
and
i
want
to
ever
so
much
do
you
mean
you
surely
do
think
of
leaving
jotin
alone
have
you
heard
what
the
doctor
says
about
him
he
said
that
just
now
there
no
special
cause
for
if
he
did
you
can
see
his
state
is
the
first
girl
after
three
brothers
and
she
a
great
i
have
heard
that
it
going
to
be
a
grand
affair
if
i
do
go
mother
will
be
very
yes
i
do
understand
your
mother
but
i
know
very
well
that
your
father
will
be
angry
enough
if
you
leave
jotin
just
now
have
to
write
a
line
to
him
saying
that
there
is
no
special
cause
for
anxiety
and
that
even
if
i
go
there
will
be
no
right
there
it
will
certainly
be
no
great
loss
if
you
do
go
but
remember
if
i
write
to
your
father
i
tell
him
plainly
what
is
in
my
mind
you
need
write
i
shall
ask
my
husband
and
he
will
surely
here
child
i
borne
a
good
deal
from
you
but
if
you
do
that
i
wo
stand
it
for
a
moment
your
father
knows
you
too
well
for
you
to
deceive
him
when
mashi
had
left
her
mani
lay
down
on
her
bed
in
a
bad
temper
her
neighbour
and
friend
came
and
asked
what
was
the
matter
here
what
a
shame
it
is
here
my
only
sister
coming
and
they
do
want
to
let
me
go
to
it
surely
you
never
thinking
of
going
are
you
with
your
husband
so
ill
do
do
anything
for
him
and
i
could
if
i
tried
it
so
deadly
dull
in
this
house
that
i
tell
you
frankly
i
ca
bear
it
are
a
strange
woman
i
ca
pretend
as
you
people
do
and
look
glum
lest
any
one
should
think
ill
of
me
tell
me
your
plan
must
go
nobody
can
prevent
me
what
an
imperious
young
woman
you
are
ii
hearing
that
mani
had
wept
at
the
mere
thought
of
going
to
her
house
jotin
was
so
excited
that
he
sat
up
in
bed
pulling
his
pillow
towards
him
he
leaned
back
and
said
open
this
window
a
little
and
take
that
lamp
away
the
still
night
stood
silently
at
the
window
like
a
pilgrim
of
eternity
and
the
stars
gazed
in
witnesses
through
untold
ages
of
countless
jotin
saw
his
mani
face
traced
on
the
background
of
the
dark
night
and
saw
those
two
big
dark
eyes
brimming
over
with
tears
as
it
were
for
all
eternity
mashi
felt
relieved
when
she
saw
him
so
quiet
thinking
he
was
asleep
suddenly
he
started
up
and
said
you
all
thought
that
mani
was
too
frivolous
ever
to
be
happy
in
our
house
but
you
see
now
i
see
now
my
baba
i
was
mistaken
but
trial
tests
a
person
baba
literally
means
father
but
is
often
used
by
elders
as
a
term
of
endearment
in
the
same
way
is
used
try
to
sleep
dear
me
think
a
little
let
me
talk
do
be
vexed
mashi
well
when
i
used
to
think
i
could
not
win
mani
heart
i
bore
it
silently
but
you
dear
i
wo
allow
you
to
say
that
i
also
bore
it
minds
you
know
are
not
clods
of
earth
which
you
can
possess
by
merely
picking
up
i
felt
that
mani
did
not
know
her
own
mind
and
that
one
day
at
some
great
shock
jotin
you
are
right
i
never
took
much
notice
of
her
waywardness
mashi
remained
silent
suppressing
a
sigh
not
once
but
often
she
had
seen
jotin
spending
the
night
on
the
verandah
wet
with
the
splashing
rain
yet
not
caring
to
go
into
his
bedroom
many
a
day
he
lay
with
a
throbbing
head
longing
she
knew
that
mani
would
come
and
soothe
his
brow
while
mani
was
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
theatre
yet
when
mashi
went
to
fan
him
he
sent
her
away
petulantly
she
alone
knew
what
pain
lay
hidden
in
that
distress
again
and
again
she
had
wanted
to
say
to
jotin
pay
so
much
attention
to
that
silly
child
my
dear
let
her
learn
to
want
to
cry
for
things
but
these
things
can
not
be
said
and
are
apt
to
be
misunderstood
jotin
had
in
his
heart
a
shrine
set
up
to
the
goddess
woman
and
there
mani
had
her
throne
it
was
hard
for
him
to
imagine
that
his
own
fate
was
to
be
denied
his
share
of
the
wine
of
love
poured
out
by
that
divinity
therefore
the
worship
went
on
the
sacrifice
was
offered
and
the
hope
of
a
boon
never
ceased
mashi
imagined
once
more
that
jotin
was
sleeping
when
he
cried
out
suddenly
know
you
thought
that
i
was
not
happy
with
mani
and
therefore
you
were
angry
with
her
but
mashi
happiness
is
like
those
stars
they
do
cover
all
the
darkness
there
are
gaps
between
we
make
mistakes
in
life
and
we
misunderstand
and
yet
there
remain
gaps
through
which
truth
shines
i
do
not
know
whence
comes
this
gladness
that
fills
my
heart
mashi
began
gently
to
soothe
jotin
brow
her
tears
unseen
in
the
dark
was
thinking
mashi
she
so
young
what
will
she
do
when
i
am
jotin
she
old
enough
i
too
was
young
when
i
lost
the
idol
of
my
life
only
to
find
him
in
my
heart
for
ever
was
that
any
loss
do
you
think
besides
is
happiness
absolutely
necessary
it
seems
as
if
just
when
mani
heart
shows
signs
of
awakening
i
have
to
you
worry
about
that
jotin
is
it
enough
if
her
heart
awakes
suddenly
jotin
recollected
the
words
of
a
village
minstrel
song
which
he
had
heard
long
before
o
my
heart
you
woke
not
when
the
man
of
my
heart
came
to
my
door
at
the
sound
of
his
departing
steps
you
woke
up
oh
you
woke
up
in
the
dark
what
is
the
time
now
nine
early
as
that
why
i
thought
it
must
be
at
least
two
or
three
my
midnight
you
know
begins
at
sundown
but
why
did
you
want
me
to
sleep
then
you
know
how
late
last
night
you
kept
awake
talking
so
you
must
get
to
sleep
early
mani
asleep
no
she
busy
making
some
soup
for
you
do
mean
to
say
so
mashi
does
she
why
she
prepares
all
your
food
the
busy
little
woman
thought
perhaps
mani
could
not
does
take
long
for
a
woman
to
learn
such
things
with
the
need
it
comes
of
itself
fish
soup
that
i
had
in
the
morning
had
such
a
delicate
flavour
i
thought
you
had
made
it
me
no
surely
you
do
think
mani
would
let
me
do
anything
for
you
why
she
does
all
your
washing
herself
she
knows
you
bear
anything
dirty
about
you
if
only
you
could
see
your
how
spick
and
span
she
keeps
it
if
i
were
to
let
her
haunt
your
she
would
wear
herself
out
but
that
what
she
really
wants
to
do
mani
health
then
doctors
think
she
should
not
be
allowed
to
visit
the
too
often
she
too
mashi
how
do
you
prevent
her
from
coming
she
obeys
me
implicitly
but
still
i
have
constantly
to
be
giving
her
news
of
you
the
stars
glistened
in
the
sky
like
jotin
bowed
his
head
in
gratitude
to
his
life
that
was
about
to
depart
and
when
death
stretched
out
his
right
hand
towards
him
through
the
darkness
he
took
it
in
perfect
trust
jotin
sighed
and
with
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
said
if
mani
is
still
awake
then
could
i
if
only
for
a
well
i
go
and
call
her
wo
keep
her
long
only
for
five
minutes
i
have
something
particular
to
tell
her
mashi
sighing
went
out
to
call
mani
meanwhile
jotin
pulse
began
to
beat
fast
he
knew
too
well
that
he
had
never
been
able
to
have
an
intimate
talk
with
mani
the
two
instruments
were
tuned
differently
and
it
was
not
easy
to
play
them
in
unison
again
and
again
jotin
had
felt
pangs
of
jealousy
on
hearing
mani
chattering
and
laughing
merrily
with
her
girl
companions
jotin
blamed
only
himself
why
could
he
talk
irrelevant
trifles
as
they
did
not
that
he
could
not
for
with
his
men
friends
he
often
chatted
on
all
sorts
of
trivialities
but
the
small
talk
that
suits
men
is
not
suitable
for
women
you
can
hold
a
philosophical
discourse
in
monologue
ignoring
your
inattentive
audience
altogether
but
small
talk
requires
the
of
at
least
two
the
bagpipes
can
be
played
singly
but
there
must
be
a
pair
of
cymbals
how
often
in
the
evenings
had
jotin
when
sitting
on
the
open
verandah
with
mani
made
some
strained
attempts
at
conversation
only
to
feel
the
thread
snap
and
the
very
silence
of
the
evening
felt
ashamed
jotin
was
certain
that
mani
longed
to
get
away
he
had
even
wished
earnestly
that
a
third
person
would
come
for
talking
is
easy
with
three
when
it
is
hard
for
two
he
began
to
think
what
he
should
say
when
mani
came
but
such
manufactured
talk
would
not
satisfy
him
jotin
felt
afraid
that
this
five
minutes
of
would
be
wasted
yet
for
him
there
were
but
few
moments
left
for
intimate
talk
iii
this
child
you
not
going
anywhere
are
you
course
i
going
to
sitarampur
do
you
mean
who
is
going
to
take
you

child
some
other
day
the
compartment
has
already
been
reserved
does
that
matter
that
loss
can
easily
be
borne
go
early
in
the
morning
i
do
hold
by
your
inauspicious
days
what
harm
if
i
do
go
wants
to
have
a
talk
with
you
right
there
still
some
time
i
just
go
and
see
him
you
must
say
that
you
are
going
well
i
wo
tell
him
but
i
sha
be
able
to
stay
long
is
my
sister
and
i
must
go
my
child
i
beg
you
to
listen
to
me
this
once
quiet
your
mind
for
a
while
and
sit
by
him
do
let
him
see
your
hurry
can
i
do
the
train
wo
wait
for
me
anath
will
be
back
in
ten
minutes
i
can
sit
by
him
till
then
that
wo
do
i
shall
never
let
you
go
to
him
in
that
frame
of
mind
oh
you
wretch
the
man
you
are
torturing
is
soon
to
leave
this
world
but
i
warn
you
you
will
remember
this
day
till
the
end
of
your
days
that
there
is
a
god
that
there
is
a
god
you
will
some
day
understand
you
must
curse
me
like
that
my
darling
boy
my
darling
why
do
you
go
on
living
longer
there
is
no
end
to
this
sin
yet
i
can
not
check
it
mashi
after
delaying
a
little
returned
to
the
hoping
by
that
time
jotin
would
be
asleep
but
jotin
moved
in
his
bed
when
she
entered
mashi
exclaimed
look
what
she
has
done
happened
has
mani
come
why
have
you
been
so
long
mashi
found
her
weeping
bitterly
because
she
had
allowed
the
milk
for
your
soup
to
get
burnt
i
tried
to
console
her
saying
why
more
milk
to
be
had
but
that
she
could
be
so
careless
about
the
preparation
of
soup
made
her
wild
with
great
trouble
i
managed
to
pacify
her
and
put
her
to
bed
so
i
have
brought
her
let
her
sleep
it
off
though
jotin
was
pained
when
mani
did
come
yet
he
felt
a
certain
amount
of
relief
he
had
half
feared
that
mani
bodily
presence
would
do
violence
to
his
heart
image
of
her
such
things
had
happened
before
in
his
life
and
the
gladness
of
the
idea
that
mani
was
miserable
at
burning
milk
filled
his
heart
to
overflowing
is
it
baba
feel
quite
certain
that
my
days
are
drawing
to
a
close
but
i
have
no
regrets
do
grieve
for
me
dear
i
wo
grieve
i
do
believe
that
only
life
is
good
and
not
death
i
tell
you
truly
that
death
seems
sweet
jotin
gazing
at
the
dark
sky
felt
that
it
was
mani
herself
who
was
coming
to
him
in
death
guise
she
had
immortal
youth
and
the
stars
were
flowers
of
blessing
showered
upon
her
dark
tresses
by
the
hand
of
the
it
seemed
as
if
once
more
he
had
his
first
sight
of
his
bride
under
the
veil
of
darkness
the
immense
night
became
filled
with
the
loving
gaze
of
mani
dark
eyes
mani
the
bride
of
this
house
the
little
girl
became
transformed
into
a
her
throne
on
the
altar
of
the
stars
at
the
confluence
of
life
and
death
jotin
said
to
himself
with
clasped
hands
last
the
veil
is
raised
the
covering
is
rent
in
this
deep
darkness
ah
beautiful
one
how
often
have
you
wrung
my
heart
but
no
longer
shall
you
forsake
me
the
bride
and
the
bridegroom
see
each
other
face
for
the
first
time
at
the
marriage
ceremony
under
a
veil
thrown
over
their
heads
iv
suffering
mashi
but
nothing
like
you
imagine
it
seems
to
me
as
if
my
pain
were
gradually
separating
itself
from
my
life
like
a
laden
boat
it
was
so
long
being
towed
behind
but
the
rope
has
snapped
and
now
it
floats
away
with
all
my
burdens
still
i
can
see
it
but
it
is
no
longer
mine
but
mashi
i
not
seen
mani
even
once
for
the
last
two
days
let
me
give
you
another
pillow
almost
seems
to
me
mashi
that
mani
also
has
left
me
like
that
laden
boat
of
sorrow
which
drifts
away
sip
some
pomegranate
juice
dear
your
throat
must
be
getting
dry
wrote
my
will
yesterday
did
i
show
it
to
you
i
ca
recollect
no
need
to
show
it
to
me
jotin
mother
died
i
had
nothing
of
my
own
you
fed
me
and
brought
me
up
therefore
i
was
saying
child
i
had
only
this
house
and
a
little
property
you
earned
the
rest
this
house
nothing
why
you
added
to
it
so
much
that
it
difficult
to
find
out
where
my
house
was
sure
mani
love
for
you
is
really
yes
i
know
that
jotin
now
you
try
to
sleep
i
have
bequeathed
all
my
property
to
mani
it
is
practically
yours
mashi
she
will
never
disobey
you
are
you
worrying
so
much
about
that
dear
i
have
i
owe
to
you
when
you
see
my
will
do
think
for
a
moment
that
do
you
mean
jotin
do
you
think
i
shall
mind
for
a
moment
because
you
give
to
mani
what
belongs
to
you
surely
i
not
so
mean
as
that
you
also
will
have
here
jotin
i
shall
get
angry
with
you
you
want
to
console
me
with
money
mashi
how
i
wish
i
could
give
you
something
better
than
money
you
have
done
jotin
more
than
enough
have
i
had
you
to
fill
my
lonely
house
i
must
have
won
that
great
in
many
previous
births
you
have
given
me
so
much
that
now
if
my
destiny
due
is
exhausted
i
shall
not
complain
yes
yes
give
away
everything
in
mani
name
your
house
your
money
your
carriage
and
your
land
such
burdens
are
too
heavy
for
me
course
i
know
you
have
lost
your
taste
for
the
enjoyments
of
life
but
mani
is
so
young
that
you
must
say
that
if
you
want
to
leave
her
your
property
it
is
all
right
but
as
for
enjoyment
harm
if
she
does
enjoy
herself
mashi
no
it
will
be
impossible
her
throat
will
become
parched
and
it
will
be
dust
and
ashes
to
her
jotin
remained
silent
he
could
not
decide
whether
it
was
true
or
not
and
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
regret
or
otherwise
that
the
world
would
become
distasteful
to
mani
for
want
of
him
the
stars
seemed
to
whisper
in
his
heart
it
is
true
we
have
been
watching
for
thousands
of
years
and
know
that
all
these
great
preparations
for
enjoyment
are
but
vanity
jotin
sighed
and
said
can
not
leave
behind
us
what
is
really
worth
giving
no
trifle
you
are
giving
dearest
i
only
pray
she
may
have
the
power
to
know
the
value
of
what
is
given
her
me
a
little
more
of
that
pomegranate
juice
mashi
i
thirsty
did
mani
come
to
me
yesterday
i
wonder
she
came
but
you
were
asleep
she
sat
by
your
head
fanning
you
for
a
long
time
and
then
went
away
to
get
your
clothes
washed
wonderful
i
believe
i
was
dreaming
that
very
moment
that
mani
was
trying
to
enter
my
room
the
door
was
slightly
open
and
she
was
pushing
against
it
but
it
would
open
but
mashi
you
going
too
far
you
ought
to
let
her
see
that
i
am
dying
otherwise
my
death
will
be
a
terrible
shock
to
her
let
me
put
this
shawl
over
your
feet
they
are
getting
cold
mashi
i
ca
bear
anything
over
me
like
that
you
know
jotin
mani
made
this
shawl
for
you
when
she
ought
to
have
been
asleep
she
was
busy
at
it
it
was
finished
only
yesterday
jotin
took
the
shawl
and
touched
it
tenderly
with
his
hands
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
softness
of
the
wool
was
mani
own
her
loving
thoughts
had
been
woven
night
after
night
with
its
threads
it
was
not
made
merely
of
wool
but
also
of
her
touch
therefore
when
mashi
drew
that
shawl
over
his
feet
it
seemed
as
if
night
after
night
mani
had
been
caressing
his
tired
limbs
mashi
i
thought
mani
did
know
how
to
knit
at
any
rate
she
never
liked
it
does
take
long
to
learn
a
thing
of
course
i
had
to
teach
her
then
there
are
a
good
many
mistakes
in
it
there
be
mistakes
we
not
going
to
send
it
to
the
paris
exhibition
it
will
keep
my
feet
warm
in
spite
of
its
mistakes
jotin
mind
began
to
picture
mani
at
her
task
blundering
and
struggling
and
yet
patiently
going
on
night
after
night
how
sweetly
pathetic
it
was
and
again
he
went
over
the
shawl
with
his
caressing
fingers
is
the
doctor
downstairs
he
will
stay
here
tell
him
it
is
useless
for
him
to
give
me
a
sleeping
draught
it
does
bring
me
real
rest
and
only
adds
to
my
pain
let
me
remain
properly
awake
do
you
know
mashi
that
my
wedding
took
place
on
the
night
of
the
full
moon
in
the
month
of
will
be
that
day
and
the
stars
of
that
very
night
will
be
shining
in
the
sky
mani
perhaps
has
forgotten
i
want
to
remind
her
of
it
just
call
her
to
me
for
a
minute
or
two
why
do
you
keep
silent
i
suppose
the
doctor
has
told
you
i
am
so
weak
that
any
excitement
will
but
i
tell
you
truly
mashi
if
i
can
have
only
a
few
minutes
talk
with
her
there
will
be
no
need
for
any
sleeping
draughts
mashi
do
cry
like
that
i
am
quite
well
my
heart
is
full
as
it
has
never
been
in
my
life
before
that
why
i
want
to
see
mani
no
no
mashi
i
ca
bear
to
see
you
crying
you
have
been
so
quiet
all
these
last
days
why
are
you
so
troubled
jotin
i
thought
that
i
had
exhausted
all
my
tears
but
i
find
there
are
plenty
left
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
mani
i
remind
her
of
our
wedding
night
so
that
she
may
going
dear
shombhu
will
wait
at
the
door
if
you
want
anything
call
him
mashi
went
to
mani
bedroom
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
crying
come
come
once
you
heartless
wretch
keep
his
last
request
who
has
given
you
his
all
do
kill
him
who
is
already
dying
jotin
hearing
the
sound
of
footsteps
started
up
saying
am
shombhu
did
you
call
me
your
mistress
to
come
whom
mistress
has
not
yet
returned
from
where
sitarampur
did
she
go
days
ago
for
a
moment
jotin
felt
numb
all
over
and
his
head
began
to
swim
he
slipped
down
from
the
pillows
on
which
he
was
reclining
and
kicked
off
the
woollen
shawl
that
was
over
his
feet
when
mashi
came
back
after
a
long
time
jotin
did
not
mention
name
and
mashi
thought
he
had
forgotten
all
about
her
suddenly
jotin
cried
out
did
i
tell
you
about
the
dream
i
had
the
other
night
dream
in
which
mani
was
pushing
the
door
and
the
door
would
open
more
than
an
inch
she
stood
outside
unable
to
enter
now
i
know
that
mani
has
to
stand
outside
my
door
till
the
last
mashi
kept
silent
she
realised
that
the
heaven
she
had
been
building
for
jotin
out
of
falsehood
had
toppled
down
at
last
if
sorrow
comes
it
is
best
to
acknowledge
when
god
strikes
we
can
not
avoid
the
blow
the
love
i
have
got
from
you
will
last
through
all
my
births
i
have
filled
this
life
with
it
to
carry
it
with
me
in
the
next
birth
i
am
sure
you
will
be
born
as
my
daughter
and
i
shall
tend
you
with
all
my
love
are
you
saying
jotin
do
you
mean
to
say
i
shall
be
born
again
as
a
woman
why
ca
you
pray
that
i
should
come
to
your
arms
as
a
son
no
not
a
son
you
will
come
to
my
house
in
that
wonderful
beauty
which
you
had
when
you
were
young
i
can
even
imagine
how
i
shall
dress
you
talk
so
much
jotin
but
try
to
sleep
shall
name
you
lakshmi
that
is
an
name
jotin
but
you
are
my
mashi
come
to
my
house
again
with
those
beautiful
manners
ca
wish
that
i
should
come
and
burden
your
home
with
the
misfortune
of
a
you
think
me
weak
and
are
wanting
to
save
me
all
trouble
child
i
am
a
woman
so
i
have
my
weakness
therefore
i
have
tried
all
my
life
to
save
you
from
all
sorts
of
trouble
only
to
fail
i
have
not
had
time
in
this
life
to
apply
the
lessons
i
have
learnt
but
they
will
keep
for
my
next
birth
i
shall
show
then
what
a
man
is
able
to
do
i
have
learnt
how
false
it
is
always
to
be
looking
after
oneself
you
may
say
darling
you
have
never
grasped
anything
for
yourself
but
given
everything
to
others
i
can
boast
of
one
thing
at
any
rate
i
have
never
been
a
tyrant
in
my
happiness
or
tried
to
enforce
my
claims
by
violence
because
lies
could
not
content
me
i
have
had
to
wait
long
perhaps
truth
will
be
kind
to
me
at
who
is
that
mashi
who
is
that
there
no
one
there
jotin
just
go
and
see

the
other
room

quite
clear
to
me
that
jotin
it
nothing
so

quiet

when
the
doctor

am
not
afraid
to
die

with
his
physic

another
nuisance

doctor

your
hand
on
her
head
and
bless
her
do
cry
like
that
mani
there
will
be
time
enough
for
that
keep
quiet
now
for
a
little
the
skeleton
in
the
room
next
to
the
one
in
which
we
boys
used
to
sleep
there
hung
a
human
skeleton
in
the
night
it
would
rattle
in
the
breeze
which
played
about
its
bones
in
the
day
these
bones
were
rattled
by
us
we
were
taking
lessons
in
osteology
from
a
student
in
the
campbell
medical
school
for
our
guardians
were
determined
to
make
us
masters
of
all
the
sciences
how
far
they
succeeded
we
need
not
tell
those
who
know
us
and
it
is
better
hidden
from
those
who
do
not
many
years
have
passed
since
then
in
the
meantime
the
skeleton
has
vanished
from
the
room
and
the
science
of
osteology
from
our
brains
leaving
no
trace
behind
the
other
day
our
house
was
crowded
with
guests
and
i
had
to
pass
the
night
in
the
same
old
room
in
these
now
unfamiliar
surroundings
sleep
refused
to
come
and
as
i
tossed
from
side
to
side
i
heard
all
the
hours
of
the
night
chimed
one
after
another
by
the
church
clock
near
by
at
length
the
lamp
in
the
corner
of
the
room
after
some
minutes
of
choking
and
spluttering
went
out
altogether
one
or
two
bereavements
had
recently
happened
in
the
family
so
the
going
out
of
the
lamp
naturally
led
me
to
thoughts
of
death
in
the
great
arena
of
nature
i
thought
the
light
of
a
lamp
losing
itself
in
eternal
darkness
and
the
going
out
of
the
light
of
our
little
human
lives
by
day
or
by
night
were
much
the
same
thing
my
train
of
thought
recalled
to
my
mind
the
skeleton
while
i
was
trying
to
imagine
what
the
body
which
had
clothed
it
could
have
been
like
it
suddenly
seemed
to
me
that
something
was
walking
round
and
round
my
bed
groping
along
the
walls
of
the
room
i
could
hear
its
rapid
breathing
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
searching
for
something
which
it
could
not
find
and
pacing
round
the
room
with
steps
i
felt
quite
sure
that
this
was
a
mere
fancy
of
my
sleepless
excited
brain
and
that
the
throbbing
of
the
veins
in
my
temples
was
really
the
sound
which
seemed
like
running
footsteps
nevertheless
a
cold
shiver
ran
all
over
me
to
help
to
get
rid
of
this
hallucination
i
called
out
aloud
is
there
the
footsteps
seemed
to
stop
at
my
bedside
and
the
reply
came
is
i
have
come
to
look
for
that
skeleton
of
mine
it
seemed
absurd
to
show
any
fear
before
the
creature
of
my
own
imagination
so
clutching
my
pillow
a
little
more
tightly
i
said
in
a
casual
sort
of
way
nice
business
for
this
time
of
night
of
what
use
will
that
skeleton
be
to
you
now
the
reply
seemed
to
come
almost
from
my
itself
a
question
in
that
skeleton
were
the
bones
that
encircled
my
heart
the
youthful
charm
of
my
years
bloomed
about
it
should
i
not
desire
to
see
it
once
more
course
said
i
perfectly
reasonable
desire
well
go
on
with
your
search
while
i
try
to
get
a
little
sleep
said
the
voice
i
fancy
you
are
lonely
all
right
i
sit
down
a
while
and
we
will
have
a
little
chat
years
ago
i
used
to
sit
by
men
and
talk
to
them
but
during
the
last
years
i
have
only
moaned
in
the
wind
in
the
of
the
dead
i
would
talk
once
more
with
a
man
as
in
the
old
times
i
felt
that
some
one
sat
down
just
near
my
curtain
resigning
myself
to
the
situation
i
replied
with
as
much
cordiality
as
i
could
summon
will
be
very
nice
indeed
let
us
talk
of
something
cheerful
funniest
thing
i
can
think
of
is
my
own
let
me
tell
you
that
the
church
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
two
i
was
in
the
land
of
the
living
and
young
i
feared
one
thing
like
death
itself
and
that
was
my
husband
my
feelings
can
be
likened
only
to
those
of
a
fish
caught
with
a
hook
for
it
was
as
if
a
stranger
had
snatched
me
away
with
the
sharpest
of
hooks
from
the
peaceful
calm
of
my
childhood
home
and
from
him
i
had
no
means
of
escape
my
husband
died
two
months
after
my
marriage
and
my
friends
and
relations
moaned
pathetically
on
my
behalf
my
husband
father
after
scrutinising
my
face
with
great
care
said
to
my
do
you
not
see
she
has
the
evil
eye
well
are
you
listening
i
hope
you
are
enjoying
the
story
much
indeed
said
i
beginning
is
extremely
humorous
me
proceed
then
i
came
back
to
my
father
house
in
great
glee
people
tried
to
conceal
it
from
me
but
i
knew
well
that
i
was
endowed
with
a
rare
and
radiant
beauty
what
is
your
opinion
likely
i
murmured
you
must
remember
that
i
never
saw
you
not
seen
me
what
about
that
skeleton
of
mine
ha
ha
ha
never
mind
i
was
only
joking
how
can
i
ever
make
you
believe
that
those
two
cavernous
hollows
contained
the
brightest
of
dark
languishing
eyes
and
that
the
smile
which
was
revealed
by
those
ruby
lips
had
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
grinning
teeth
which
you
used
to
see
the
mere
attempt
to
convey
to
you
some
idea
of
the
grace
the
charm
the
soft
firm
dimpled
curves
which
in
the
fulness
of
youth
were
growing
and
blossoming
over
those
dry
old
bones
makes
me
smile
it
also
makes
me
angry
the
most
eminent
doctors
of
my
time
could
not
have
dreamed
of
the
bones
of
that
body
of
mine
as
materials
for
teaching
osteology
do
you
know
one
young
doctor
that
i
knew
of
actually
compared
me
to
a
golden
blossom
it
meant
that
to
him
the
rest
of
humankind
was
fit
only
to
illustrate
the
science
of
physiology
that
i
was
a
flower
of
beauty
does
any
one
think
of
the
skeleton
of
a
flower
i
walked
i
felt
that
like
a
diamond
scattering
splendour
my
every
movement
set
waves
of
beauty
radiating
on
every
side
i
used
to
spend
hours
gazing
on
my
hands
hands
which
could
gracefully
have
reined
the
liveliest
of
male
creatures
that
stark
and
staring
old
skeleton
of
mine
has
borne
to
you
against
me
while
i
was
unable
to
refute
the
shameless
libel
that
is
why
of
all
men
i
hate
you
most
i
feel
i
would
like
once
for
all
to
banish
sleep
from
your
eyes
with
a
vision
of
that
warm
rosy
loveliness
of
mine
to
sweep
out
with
it
all
the
wretched
osteological
stuff
of
which
your
brain
is
full
could
have
sworn
by
your
body
cried
i
you
had
it
still
that
no
vestige
of
osteology
has
remained
in
my
head
and
that
the
only
thing
that
it
is
now
full
of
is
a
radiant
vision
of
perfect
loveliness
glowing
against
the
black
background
of
night
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
had
no
went
on
the
voice
only
brother
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
marry
in
the
zenana
i
was
alone
alone
i
used
to
sit
in
the
garden
under
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
dream
that
the
whole
world
was
in
love
with
me
that
the
stars
with
sleepless
gaze
were
drinking
in
my
beauty
that
the
wind
was
languishing
in
sighs
as
on
some
pretext
or
other
it
brushed
past
me
and
that
the
lawn
on
which
my
feet
rested
had
it
been
conscious
would
have
lost
consciousness
again
at
their
touch
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
the
young
men
in
the
world
were
as
blades
of
grass
at
my
feet
and
my
heart
i
know
not
why
used
to
grow
sad
my
brother
friend
shekhar
had
passed
out
of
the
medical
college
he
became
our
family
doctor
i
had
already
often
seen
him
from
behind
a
curtain
my
brother
was
a
strange
man
and
did
not
care
to
look
on
the
world
with
open
eyes
it
was
not
empty
enough
for
his
taste
so
he
gradually
moved
away
from
it
until
he
was
quite
lost
in
an
obscure
corner
shekhar
was
his
one
friend
so
he
was
the
only
young
man
i
could
ever
get
to
see
and
when
i
held
my
evening
court
in
my
garden
then
the
host
of
imaginary
young
men
whom
i
had
at
my
feet
were
each
one
a
are
you
listening
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
sighed
as
i
replied
was
wishing
i
was
shekhar
a
bit
hear
the
whole
story
first
one
day
in
the
rains
i
was
feverish
the
doctor
came
to
see
me
that
was
our
first
meeting
i
was
reclining
opposite
the
window
so
that
the
blush
of
the
evening
sky
might
temper
the
pallor
of
my
complexion
when
the
doctor
coming
in
looked
up
into
my
face
i
put
myself
into
his
place
and
gazed
at
myself
in
imagination
i
saw
in
the
glorious
evening
light
that
delicate
wan
face
laid
like
a
drooping
flower
against
the
soft
white
pillow
with
the
unrestrained
curls
playing
over
the
forehead
and
the
bashfully
lowered
eyelids
casting
a
pathetic
shade
over
the
whole
countenance
doctor
in
a
tone
bashfully
low
asked
my
brother
might
i
feel
her
pulse
put
out
a
tired
wrist
from
beneath
the
coverlet
ah
thought
i
as
i
looked
on
it
if
only
there
had
been
a
sapphire
bracelet
i
have
never
before
seen
a
doctor
so
awkward
about
feeling
a
patient
pulse
his
fingers
trembled
as
they
felt
my
wrist
he
measured
the
heat
of
my
fever
i
gauged
the
pulse
of
his
do
you
believe
me
widows
are
supposed
to
dress
in
white
only
without
ornaments
or
jewellery
easily
said
i
human
tells
its
tale
i
had
been
taken
ill
and
restored
to
health
several
times
i
found
that
the
number
of
the
courtiers
who
attended
my
imaginary
evening
reception
began
to
dwindle
till
they
were
reduced
to
only
one
and
at
last
in
my
little
world
there
remained
only
one
doctor
and
one
patient
these
evenings
i
used
to
dress
myself
secretly
in
a
twine
about
the
braided
knot
into
which
i
did
my
hair
a
garland
of
white
jasmine
blossoms
and
with
a
little
mirror
in
my
hand
betake
myself
to
my
usual
seat
under
the
trees
see
note
on
are
you
perhaps
thinking
that
the
sight
of
one
own
beauty
would
soon
grow
wearisome
ah
no
for
i
did
not
see
myself
with
my
own
eyes
i
was
then
one
and
also
two
i
used
to
see
myself
as
though
i
were
the
doctor
i
gazed
i
was
charmed
i
fell
madly
in
love
but
in
spite
of
all
the
caresses
i
lavished
on
myself
a
sigh
would
wander
about
my
heart
moaning
like
the
evening
breeze
from
that
time
i
was
never
alone
when
i
walked
i
watched
with
downcast
eyes
the
play
of
my
dainty
little
toes
on
the
earth
and
wondered
what
the
doctor
would
have
felt
had
he
been
there
to
see
at
the
sky
would
be
filled
with
the
glare
of
the
sun
without
a
sound
save
now
and
then
the
distant
cry
of
a
passing
kite
outside
our
the
hawker
would
pass
with
his
musical
cry
of
bangles
for
sale
crystal
bangles
and
i
spreading
a
sheet
on
the
lawn
would
lie
on
it
with
my
head
on
my
arm
with
studied
carelessness
the
other
arm
would
rest
lightly
on
the
soft
sheet
and
i
would
imagine
to
myself
that
some
one
had
caught
sight
of
the
wonderful
pose
of
my
hand
that
some
one
had
clasped
it
in
both
of
his
and
imprinted
a
kiss
on
its
rosy
palm
and
was
slowly
walking
what
if
i
ended
the
story
here
how
would
it
do
half
a
bad
ending
i
replied
thoughtfully
would
no
doubt
remain
a
little
incomplete
but
i
could
easily
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
putting
in
the
finishing
touches
that
would
make
the
story
too
serious
where
would
the
laugh
come
in
where
would
be
the
skeleton
with
its
grinning
teeth
let
me
go
on
as
soon
as
the
doctor
had
got
a
little
practice
he
took
a
room
on
the
of
our
house
for
a
i
used
then
sometimes
to
ask
him
jokingly
about
medicines
and
poisons
and
how
much
of
this
drug
or
that
would
kill
a
man
the
subject
was
congenial
and
he
would
wax
eloquent
these
talks
familiarised
me
with
the
idea
of
death
and
so
love
and
death
were
the
only
two
things
that
filled
my
little
world
my
story
is
now
nearly
ended
there
is
not
much
left
much
of
the
night
is
left
either
i
muttered
a
time
i
noticed
that
the
doctor
had
grown
strangely
and
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
something
which
he
was
trying
to
keep
from
me
one
day
he
came
in
somewhat
smartly
dressed
and
borrowed
my
brother
carriage
for
the
evening
curiosity
became
too
much
for
me
and
i
went
up
to
my
brother
for
information
after
some
talk
beside
the
point
i
at
last
asked
him
by
the
way
dada
where
is
the
doctor
going
this
evening
in
your
carriage
elder
brother
brother
briefly
replied
to
his
death
oh
do
tell
me
i
importuned
where
is
he
really
going
to
be
married
he
said
a
little
more
explicitly
oh
indeed
said
i
as
i
laughed
long
and
loudly
gradually
learnt
that
the
bride
was
an
heiress
who
would
bring
the
doctor
a
large
sum
of
money
but
why
did
he
insult
me
by
hiding
all
this
from
me
had
i
ever
begged
and
prayed
him
not
to
marry
because
it
would
break
my
heart
men
are
not
to
be
trusted
i
have
known
only
one
man
in
all
my
life
and
in
a
moment
i
made
this
discovery
the
doctor
came
in
after
his
work
and
was
ready
to
start
i
said
to
him
rippling
with
laughter
the
while
well
doctor
so
you
are
to
be
married
gaiety
not
only
made
the
doctor
lose
countenance
it
thoroughly
irritated
him
how
is
it
i
went
on
that
there
is
no
illumination
no
band
of
music
a
sigh
he
replied
is
marriage
then
such
a
joyful
occasion
burst
out
into
renewed
laughter
no
no
said
i
this
will
never
do
who
ever
heard
of
a
wedding
without
lights
and
music
bothered
my
brother
about
it
so
much
that
he
at
once
ordered
all
the
trappings
of
a
gay
wedding
the
time
i
kept
on
gaily
talking
of
the
bride
of
what
would
happen
of
what
i
would
do
when
the
bride
came
home
and
doctor
i
asked
will
you
still
go
on
feeling
pulses
ha
ha
ha
though
the
inner
workings
of
people
especially
men
minds
are
not
visible
still
i
can
take
my
oath
that
these
words
were
piercing
the
doctor
bosom
like
deadly
darts
marriage
was
to
be
celebrated
late
at
night
before
starting
the
doctor
and
my
brother
were
having
a
glass
of
wine
together
on
the
terrace
as
was
their
daily
habit
the
moon
had
just
risen
went
up
smiling
and
said
have
you
forgotten
your
wedding
doctor
it
is
time
to
start
must
here
tell
you
one
little
thing
i
had
meanwhile
gone
down
to
the
dispensary
and
got
a
little
powder
which
at
a
convenient
opportunity
i
had
dropped
unobserved
into
the
doctor
glass
doctor
draining
his
glass
at
a
gulp
in
a
voice
thick
with
emotion
and
with
a
look
that
pierced
me
to
the
heart
said
then
i
must
go
music
struck
up
i
went
into
my
room
and
dressed
myself
in
my
of
silk
and
gold
i
took
out
my
jewellery
and
ornaments
from
the
safe
and
put
them
all
on
i
put
the
red
mark
of
wifehood
on
the
parting
in
my
hair
and
then
under
the
tree
in
the
garden
i
prepared
my
bed
was
a
beautiful
night
the
gentle
south
wind
was
kissing
away
the
weariness
of
the
world
the
scent
of
jasmine
and
filled
the
garden
with
rejoicing
the
sound
of
the
music
began
to
grow
fainter
and
fainter
the
light
of
the
moon
to
get
dimmer
and
dimmer
the
world
with
its
lifelong
associations
of
home
and
kin
to
fade
away
from
my
perceptions
like
some
illusion
then
i
closed
my
eyes
and
smiled
fancied
that
when
people
came
and
found
me
they
would
see
that
smile
of
mine
lingering
on
my
lips
like
a
trace
of
wine
that
when
i
thus
slowly
entered
my
eternal
i
should
carry
with
me
this
smile
illuminating
my
face
but
alas
for
the
alas
for
the
of
silk
and
gold
when
i
woke
at
the
sound
of
a
rattling
within
me
i
found
three
urchins
learning
osteology
from
my
skeleton
where
in
my
bosom
my
joys
and
griefs
used
to
throb
and
the
petals
of
youth
to
open
one
by
one
there
the
master
with
his
pointer
was
busy
naming
my
bones
and
as
to
that
last
smile
which
i
had
so
carefully
rehearsed
did
you
see
any
sign
of
that
well
how
did
you
like
the
story
has
been
delightful
said
i
at
this
point
the
first
crow
began
to
caw
you
there
i
asked
there
was
no
reply
the
morning
light
entered
the
room
the
auspicious
vision
kantichandra
was
young
yet
after
his
wife
death
he
sought
no
second
partner
and
gave
his
mind
to
the
hunting
of
beasts
and
birds
his
body
was
long
and
slender
hard
and
agile
his
sight
keen
his
aim
unerring
he
dressed
like
a
countryman
and
took
with
him
hira
singh
the
wrestler
chakkanlal
khan
saheb
the
musician
mian
saheb
and
many
others
he
had
no
lack
of
idle
followers
in
the
month
of
kanti
had
gone
out
shooting
near
the
swamp
of
nydighi
with
a
few
sporting
companions
they
were
in
boats
and
an
army
of
servants
in
boats
also
filled
the
the
village
women
found
it
impossible
to
bathe
or
to
draw
water
all
day
long
land
and
water
trembled
to
the
firing
of
the
guns
and
every
evening
musicians
killed
the
chance
of
sleep
one
morning
as
kanti
was
seated
in
his
boat
cleaning
a
favourite
gun
he
suddenly
started
at
what
he
thought
was
the
cry
of
wild
duck
looking
up
he
saw
a
village
maiden
coming
to
the
water
edge
with
two
white
ducklings
clasped
to
her
breast
the
little
stream
was
almost
stagnant
many
weeds
choked
the
current
the
girl
put
the
birds
into
the
water
and
watched
them
anxiously
evidently
the
presence
of
the
sportsmen
was
the
cause
of
her
care
and
not
the
wildness
of
the
ducks
the
girl
beauty
had
a
rare
freshness
as
if
she
had
just
come
from
vishwakarma
workshop
it
was
difficult
to
guess
her
age
her
figure
was
almost
a
woman
but
her
face
was
so
childish
that
clearly
the
world
had
left
no
impression
there
she
seemed
not
to
know
herself
that
she
had
reached
the
threshold
of
youth
the
divine
craftsman
in
hindu
mythology
kanti
stopped
for
a
while
he
was
fascinated
he
had
not
expected
to
see
such
a
face
in
such
a
spot
and
yet
its
beauty
suited
its
surroundings
better
than
it
would
have
suited
a
palace
a
bud
is
lovelier
on
the
bough
than
in
a
golden
vase
that
day
the
blossoming
reeds
glittered
in
the
autumn
dew
and
morning
sun
and
the
fresh
simple
face
set
in
the
midst
was
like
a
picture
of
festival
to
kanti
enchanted
mind
kalidos
has
forgotten
to
sing
how
herself
sometimes
has
come
to
the
young
ganges
with
just
such
ducklings
in
her
breast
as
he
gazed
the
maiden
started
in
terror
and
hurriedly
took
back
the
ducks
into
her
bosom
with
a
cry
of
pain
in
another
moment
she
had
left
the
and
disappeared
into
the
bamboo
thicket
hard
by
looking
round
kanti
saw
one
of
his
men
pointing
an
unloaded
gun
at
the
ducks
he
at
once
went
up
to
him
wrenched
away
his
gun
and
bestowed
on
his
cheek
a
prodigious
slap
the
astonished
humourist
finished
his
joke
on
the
floor
kanti
went
on
cleaning
his
gun
but
curiosity
drove
kanti
to
the
thicket
wherein
he
had
seen
the
girl
disappear
pushing
his
way
through
he
found
himself
in
the
yard
of
a
householder
on
one
side
was
a
row
of
conical
thatched
barns
on
the
other
a
clean
at
the
end
of
which
grew
a
bush
under
the
bush
was
seated
the
girl
he
had
seen
that
morning
sobbing
over
a
wounded
dove
into
whose
yellow
beak
she
was
trying
to
wring
a
little
water
from
the
moist
corner
of
her
garment
a
grey
cat
its
on
her
knee
was
looking
eagerly
at
the
bird
and
every
now
and
then
when
it
got
too
forward
she
kept
it
in
its
place
by
a
warning
tap
on
the
nose
this
little
picture
set
in
the
peaceful
surroundings
of
the
householder
yard
instantly
impressed
itself
on
kanti
sensitive
heart
the
checkered
light
and
shade
flickering
beneath
the
delicate
foliage
of
the
played
on
the
girl
lap
not
far
off
a
cow
was
chewing
the
cud
and
lazily
keeping
off
the
flies
with
slow
movements
of
its
head
and
tail
the
north
wind
whispered
softly
in
the
rustling
bamboo
thickets
and
she
who
at
dawn
on
the
had
looked
like
the
forest
queen
now
in
the
silence
of
noon
showed
the
eager
pity
of
the
divine
housewife
kanti
coming
in
upon
her
with
his
gun
had
a
sense
of
intrusion
he
felt
like
a
thief
caught
he
longed
to
explain
that
it
was
not
he
who
had
hurt
the
dove
as
he
wondered
how
he
should
begin
there
came
a
call
of
from
the
house
the
girl
jumped
up
came
the
voice
again
she
took
up
her
dove
and
ran
within
thought
kanti
an
appropriate
name
means
nectar
ambrosia
kanti
returned
to
the
boat
handed
his
gun
to
his
men
and
went
over
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
he
found
a
brahmin
with
a
peaceful
face
seated
on
a
bench
outside
and
reading
a
devotional
book
kanti
saw
in
his
kindly
thoughtful
face
something
of
the
tenderness
which
shone
in
the
face
of
the
maiden
kanti
saluted
him
and
said
i
ask
for
some
water
sir
i
am
very
thirsty
the
elder
man
welcomed
him
with
eager
hospitality
and
offering
him
a
seat
on
the
bench
went
inside
and
fetched
with
his
own
hands
a
little
brass
plate
of
sugar
wafers
and
a
vessel
full
of
water
after
kanti
had
eaten
and
drunk
the
brahmin
begged
him
to
introduce
himself
kanti
gave
his
own
name
his
father
name
and
the
address
of
his
home
and
then
said
in
the
usual
way
i
can
be
of
any
service
sir
i
shall
deem
myself
fortunate
require
no
service
my
son
said
nabin
banerji
have
only
one
care
at
present
is
that
sir
said
kanti
is
my
daughter
sudha
who
is
growing
up
kanti
smiled
as
he
thought
of
her
babyish
face
for
whom
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
find
a
worthy
bridegroom
if
i
could
only
see
her
well
married
all
my
debt
to
this
world
would
be
paid
but
there
is
no
suitable
bridegroom
here
and
i
can
not
leave
my
charge
of
gopinath
here
to
search
for
a
husband
elsewhere
you
would
see
me
in
my
boat
sir
we
would
have
a
talk
about
the
marriage
of
your
daughter
so
saying
kanti
repeated
his
salute
and
went
back
he
then
sent
some
of
his
men
into
the
village
to
inquire
and
in
answer
heard
nothing
but
praise
of
the
beauty
and
virtues
of
the
brahmin
daughter
when
next
day
the
old
man
came
to
the
boat
on
his
promised
visit
kanti
bent
low
in
salutation
and
begged
the
hand
of
his
daughter
for
himself
the
brahmin
was
so
much
overcome
by
this
piece
of
good
fortune
for
kanti
not
only
belonged
to
a
brahmin
family
but
was
also
a
landed
proprietor
of
wealth
and
position
that
at
first
he
could
hardly
utter
a
word
in
reply
he
thought
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
and
at
length
mechanically
repeated
desire
to
marry
my
daughter
you
will
deign
to
give
her
to
me
said
kanti
mean
sudha
he
asked
again
was
the
reply
will
you
not
first
see
and
speak
to
her
kanti
pretending
he
had
not
seen
her
already
said
that
we
shall
do
at
the
moment
of
the
auspicious
vision
after
betrothal
the
prospective
bride
and
bridegroom
are
not
supposed
to
see
each
other
again
till
that
part
of
the
wedding
ceremony
which
is
called
auspicious
in
a
voice
husky
with
emotion
the
old
man
said
sudha
is
indeed
a
good
girl
well
skilled
in
all
the
household
arts
as
you
are
so
generously
taking
her
on
trust
may
she
never
cause
you
a
regret
this
is
my
blessing
the
mansion
of
the
mazumdars
had
been
borrowed
for
the
wedding
ceremony
which
was
fixed
for
next
as
kanti
did
not
wish
to
delay
in
due
time
the
bridegroom
arrived
on
his
elephant
with
drums
and
music
and
with
a
torchlight
procession
and
the
ceremony
began
when
the
bridal
couple
were
covered
with
the
scarlet
screen
for
the
rite
of
the
auspicious
vision
kanti
looked
up
at
his
bride
in
that
bashful
downcast
face
crowned
with
the
wedding
coronet
and
bedecked
with
sandal
paste
he
could
scarcely
recognise
the
village
maiden
of
his
fancy
and
in
the
fulness
of
his
emotion
a
mist
seemed
to
becloud
his
eyes
at
the
gathering
of
women
in
the
bridal
chamber
after
the
wedding
ceremony
was
over
an
old
village
dame
insisted
that
kanti
himself
should
take
off
his
wife
bridal
veil
as
he
did
so
he
started
back
it
was
not
the
same
girl
something
rose
from
within
his
breast
and
pierced
into
his
brain
the
light
of
the
lamps
seemed
to
grow
dim
and
darkness
to
tarnish
the
face
of
the
bride
herself
at
first
he
felt
angry
with
his
the
old
scoundrel
had
shown
him
one
girl
and
married
him
to
another
but
on
calmer
reflection
he
remembered
that
the
old
man
had
not
shown
him
any
daughter
at
all
that
it
was
all
his
own
fault
he
thought
it
best
not
to
show
his
arrant
folly
to
the
world
and
took
his
place
again
with
apparent
calmness
he
could
swallow
the
powder
he
could
not
get
rid
of
its
taste
he
could
not
bear
the
of
the
festive
throng
he
was
in
a
blaze
of
anger
with
himself
as
well
as
with
everybody
else
suddenly
he
felt
the
bride
seated
by
his
side
give
a
little
start
and
a
suppressed
scream
a
leveret
scampering
into
the
room
had
brushed
across
her
feet
close
upon
it
followed
the
girl
he
had
seen
before
she
caught
up
the
leveret
into
her
arms
and
began
to
caress
it
with
an
affectionate
murmuring
the
mad
girl
cried
the
women
as
they
made
signs
to
her
to
leave
the
room
she
heeded
them
not
however
but
came
and
unconcernedly
sat
in
front
of
the
wedded
pair
looking
into
their
faces
with
a
childish
curiosity
when
a
maidservant
came
and
took
her
by
the
arm
to
lead
her
away
kanti
hurriedly
interposed
saying
her
be
is
your
name
he
then
went
on
to
ask
her
the
girl
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
but
gave
no
reply
all
the
women
in
the
room
began
to
titter
kanti
put
another
question
those
ducklings
of
yours
grown
up
the
girl
stared
at
him
as
unconcernedly
as
before
the
bewildered
kanti
screwed
up
courage
for
another
effort
and
asked
tenderly
after
the
wounded
dove
but
with
no
avail
the
increasing
laughter
in
the
room
betokened
an
amusing
joke
at
last
kanti
learned
that
the
girl
was
deaf
and
dumb
the
companion
of
all
the
animals
and
birds
of
the
locality
it
was
but
by
chance
that
she
rose
the
other
day
when
the
name
of
sudha
was
called
kanti
now
received
a
second
shock
a
black
screen
lifted
from
before
his
eyes
with
a
sigh
of
intense
relief
as
of
escape
from
calamity
he
looked
once
more
into
the
face
of
his
bride
then
came
the
true
auspicious
vision
the
light
from
his
heart
and
from
the
smokeless
lamps
fell
on
her
gracious
face
and
he
saw
it
in
its
true
radiance
knowing
that
nabin
blessing
would
find
fulfilment
the
supreme
night
i
used
to
go
to
the
same
dame
school
with
surabala
and
play
at
marriage
with
her
when
i
paid
visits
to
her
house
her
mother
would
pet
me
and
setting
us
side
by
side
would
say
to
herself
a
lovely
pair
i
was
a
child
then
but
i
could
understand
her
meaning
well
enough
the
idea
became
rooted
in
my
mind
that
i
had
a
special
right
to
surabala
above
that
of
people
in
general
so
it
happened
that
in
the
pride
of
ownership
at
times
i
punished
and
tormented
her
and
she
too
fagged
for
me
and
bore
all
my
punishments
without
complaint
the
village
was
wont
to
praise
her
beauty
but
in
the
eyes
of
a
young
barbarian
like
me
that
beauty
had
no
glory
i
knew
only
that
surabala
had
been
born
in
her
father
house
solely
to
bear
my
yoke
and
that
therefore
she
was
the
particular
object
of
my
neglect
my
father
was
the
of
the
chaudhuris
a
family
of
it
was
his
plan
as
soon
as
i
had
learnt
to
write
a
good
hand
to
train
me
in
the
work
of
estate
management
and
secure
a
rent
collectorship
for
me
somewhere
but
in
my
heart
i
disliked
the
proposal
nilratan
of
our
village
had
run
away
to
calcutta
had
learnt
english
there
and
finally
became
the
of
the
district
magistrate
was
my
life
ideal
i
was
secretly
determined
to
be
the
head
clerk
of
the
judge
court
even
if
i
could
not
become
the
magistrate
superintendent
of
bailiffs
i
saw
that
my
father
always
treated
these
court
officers
with
the
greatest
respect
i
knew
from
my
childhood
that
they
had
to
be
propitiated
with
gifts
of
fish
vegetables
and
even
money
for
this
reason
i
had
given
a
seat
of
high
honour
in
my
heart
to
the
court
underlings
even
to
the
bailiffs
these
are
the
gods
worshipped
in
our
bengal
a
modern
miniature
edition
of
the
millions
of
deities
of
the
hindu
pantheon
for
gaining
material
success
people
have
more
genuine
faith
in
than
in
the
good
ganesh
the
giver
of
success
hence
the
people
now
offer
to
these
officers
everything
that
was
formerly
ganesh
due
fired
by
the
example
of
nilratan
i
too
seized
a
suitable
opportunity
and
ran
away
to
calcutta
there
i
first
put
up
in
the
house
of
a
village
acquaintance
and
afterwards
got
some
funds
from
my
father
for
my
education
thus
i
carried
on
my
studies
regularly
in
addition
i
joined
political
and
benevolent
societies
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
it
was
urgently
necessary
for
me
to
give
my
life
suddenly
for
my
country
but
i
knew
not
how
such
a
hard
task
could
be
carried
out
also
no
one
showed
me
the
way
but
nevertheless
my
enthusiasm
did
not
abate
at
all
we
country
lads
had
not
learnt
to
sneer
at
everything
like
the
precocious
boys
of
calcutta
and
hence
our
faith
was
very
strong
the
of
our
associations
delivered
speeches
and
we
went
begging
for
subscriptions
from
door
to
door
in
the
hot
blaze
of
noon
without
breaking
our
fast
or
we
stood
by
the
roadside
distributing
or
arranged
the
chairs
and
benches
in
the
and
if
anybody
whispered
a
word
against
our
leader
we
got
ready
to
fight
him
for
these
things
the
city
boys
used
to
laugh
at
us
as
provincials
i
had
come
to
calcutta
to
be
a
or
a
head
clerk
but
i
was
preparing
to
become
a
mazzini
or
a
garibaldi
at
this
time
surabala
father
and
my
father
laid
their
heads
together
to
unite
us
in
marriage
i
had
come
to
calcutta
at
the
age
of
fifteen
surabala
was
eight
years
old
then
i
was
now
eighteen
and
in
my
father
opinion
i
was
almost
past
the
age
of
marriage
but
it
was
my
secret
vow
to
remain
unmarried
all
my
life
and
to
die
for
my
country
so
i
told
my
father
that
i
would
not
marry
before
i
had
finished
my
education
in
two
or
three
months
i
learnt
that
surabala
had
been
married
to
a
pleader
named
ram
lochan
i
was
then
busy
collecting
subscriptions
for
raising
fallen
india
and
this
news
did
not
seem
worth
my
thought
i
had
matriculated
and
was
about
to
appear
at
the
intermediate
examination
when
my
father
died
i
was
not
alone
in
the
world
but
had
to
maintain
my
mother
and
two
sisters
i
had
therefore
to
leave
college
and
look
out
for
employment
after
a
good
deal
of
exertion
i
secured
the
post
of
second
master
in
the
matriculation
school
of
a
small
town
in
the
noakhali
district
i
thought
here
is
just
the
work
for
me
by
my
advice
and
inspiration
i
shall
train
up
every
one
of
my
pupils
as
a
general
for
future
india
i
began
to
work
and
then
found
that
the
impending
examination
was
a
more
pressing
affair
than
the
future
of
india
the
headmaster
got
angry
whenever
i
talked
of
anything
outside
grammar
or
algebra
and
in
a
few
months
my
enthusiasm
too
flagged
i
am
no
genius
in
the
quiet
of
the
home
i
may
form
vast
plans
but
when
i
enter
the
field
of
work
i
have
to
bear
the
yoke
of
the
plough
on
my
neck
like
the
indian
bullock
get
my
tail
twisted
by
my
master
break
clods
all
day
patiently
and
with
bowed
head
and
then
at
sunset
have
to
be
satisfied
if
i
can
get
any
cud
to
chew
such
a
creature
has
not
the
spirit
to
prance
and
caper
one
of
the
teachers
lived
in
the
to
guard
against
fires
as
i
was
a
bachelor
this
work
was
thrown
on
me
i
lodged
in
a
thatched
shed
close
to
the
large
cottage
in
which
the
school
sat
the
stood
at
some
distance
from
the
inhabited
portion
of
the
town
and
beside
a
big
tank
around
it
were
and
trees
and
very
near
to
the
school
building
two
large
ancient
trees
grew
close
together
and
cast
a
cool
shade
around
one
thing
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
and
indeed
i
had
not
so
long
considered
it
worth
mentioning
the
local
government
pleader
ram
lochan
ray
lived
near
our
school
i
also
knew
that
his
wife
my
early
playmate
surabala
lived
with
him
i
got
acquainted
with
ram
lochan
babu
i
can
not
say
whether
he
knew
that
i
had
known
surabala
in
childhood
i
did
not
think
fit
to
mention
the
fact
at
my
first
introduction
to
him
indeed
i
did
not
clearly
remember
that
surabala
had
been
ever
linked
with
my
life
in
any
way
one
holiday
i
paid
a
visit
to
ram
lochan
babu
the
subject
of
our
conversation
has
gone
out
of
my
mind
probably
it
was
the
unhappy
condition
of
india
not
that
he
was
very
much
concerned
or
over
the
matter
but
the
subject
was
such
that
one
could
freely
pour
forth
one
sentimental
sorrow
over
it
for
an
hour
or
two
while
puffing
at
one
while
thus
engaged
i
heard
in
a
the
softest
possible
jingle
of
bracelets
crackle
of
dress
and
footfall
and
i
felt
certain
that
two
curious
eyes
were
watching
me
through
a
small
opening
of
the
window
all
at
once
there
flashed
upon
my
memory
a
pair
of
eyes
a
pair
of
large
eyes
beaming
with
trust
simplicity
and
girlhood
love
black
pupils
thick
dark
eyelashes
a
calm
fixed
gaze
suddenly
some
unseen
force
squeezed
my
heart
in
an
iron
grip
and
it
throbbed
with
intense
pain
i
returned
to
my
house
but
the
pain
clung
to
me
whether
i
read
wrote
or
did
any
other
work
i
could
not
shake
that
weight
off
my
heart
a
heavy
load
seemed
to
be
always
swinging
from
my
in
the
evening
calming
myself
a
little
i
began
to
reflect
ails
me
from
within
came
the
question
is
surabala
now
i
replied
gave
her
up
of
my
free
will
surely
i
did
not
expect
her
to
wait
for
me
for
ever
but
something
kept
saying
you
could
have
got
her
merely
for
the
asking
you
have
not
the
right
to
look
at
her
even
once
do
what
you
will
that
surabala
of
your
boyhood
may
come
very
close
to
you
you
may
hear
the
jingle
of
her
bracelets
you
may
breathe
the
air
embalmed
by
the
essence
of
her
hair
but
there
will
always
be
a
wall
between
you
two
i
answered
it
so
what
is
surabala
to
me
my
heart
rejoined
surabala
is
nobody
to
you
but
what
might
she
not
have
been
to
you
ah
that
true
might
she
not
have
been
to
me
dearest
to
me
of
all
things
closer
to
me
than
the
world
besides
the
sharer
of
all
my
life
joys
and
sorrows
she
might
have
been
and
now
she
is
so
distant
so
much
of
a
stranger
that
to
look
on
her
is
forbidden
to
talk
with
her
is
improper
and
to
think
of
her
is
a
sin
while
this
ram
lochan
coming
suddenly
from
nowhere
has
muttered
a
few
set
religious
texts
and
in
one
swoop
has
carried
off
surabala
from
the
rest
of
mankind
i
have
not
come
to
preach
a
new
ethical
code
or
to
revolutionise
society
i
have
no
wish
to
tear
asunder
domestic
ties
i
am
only
expressing
the
exact
working
of
my
mind
though
it
may
not
be
reasonable
i
could
not
by
any
means
banish
from
my
mind
the
sense
that
surabala
reigning
there
within
shelter
of
ram
lochan
home
was
mine
far
more
than
his
the
thought
was
i
admit
unreasonable
and
improper
but
it
was
not
unnatural
thereafter
i
could
not
set
my
mind
to
any
kind
of
work
at
noon
when
the
boys
in
my
class
hummed
when
nature
outside
simmered
in
the
sun
when
the
sweet
scent
of
the
blossoms
entered
the
room
on
the
tepid
breeze
i
then
wished
i
know
not
what
i
wished
for
but
this
i
can
say
that
i
did
not
wish
to
pass
all
my
life
in
correcting
the
grammar
exercises
of
those
future
hopes
of
india
when
school
was
over
i
could
not
bear
to
live
in
my
large
lonely
house
and
yet
if
any
one
paid
me
a
visit
it
bored
me
in
the
gloaming
as
i
sat
by
the
tank
and
listened
to
the
meaningless
breeze
sighing
through
the
and
palms
i
used
to
muse
that
human
society
is
a
web
of
mistakes
nobody
has
the
sense
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
and
when
the
chance
is
gone
we
break
our
hearts
over
vain
longings
i
could
have
married
surabala
and
lived
happily
but
i
must
be
a
garibaldi
and
i
ended
by
becoming
the
second
master
of
a
village
school
and
pleader
ram
lochan
ray
who
had
no
special
call
to
be
surabala
husband
to
whom
before
his
marriage
surabala
was
no
wise
different
from
a
hundred
other
maidens
has
very
quietly
married
her
and
is
earning
lots
of
money
as
government
pleader
when
his
dinner
is
badly
cooked
he
scolds
surabala
and
when
he
is
in
good
humour
he
gives
her
a
bangle
he
is
sleek
and
fat
tidily
dressed
free
from
every
kind
of
worry
never
passes
his
evenings
by
the
tank
gazing
at
the
stars
and
sighing
ram
lochan
was
called
away
from
our
town
for
a
few
days
by
a
big
case
elsewhere
surabala
in
her
house
was
as
lonely
as
i
was
in
my
school
building
i
remember
it
was
a
monday
the
sky
was
overcast
with
clouds
from
the
morning
it
began
to
drizzle
at
ten
at
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
our
headmaster
closed
the
school
early
all
day
the
black
detached
clouds
began
to
run
about
in
the
sky
as
if
making
ready
for
some
grand
display
next
day
towards
afternoon
the
rain
descended
in
torrents
accompanied
by
storm
as
the
night
advanced
the
fury
of
wind
and
water
increased
at
first
the
wind
was
easterly
gradually
it
veered
and
blew
towards
the
south
and
it
was
idle
to
try
to
sleep
on
such
a
night
i
remembered
that
in
this
terrible
weather
surabala
was
alone
in
her
house
our
school
was
much
more
strongly
built
than
her
bungalow
often
and
often
did
i
plan
to
invite
her
to
the
while
i
meant
to
pass
the
night
alone
by
the
tank
but
i
could
not
summon
up
courage
for
it
when
it
was
one
in
the
morning
the
roar
of
the
tidal
wave
was
suddenly
heard
the
sea
was
rushing
on
us
i
left
my
room
and
ran
towards
surabala
house
in
the
way
stood
one
embankment
of
our
tank
and
as
i
was
wading
to
it
the
flood
already
reached
my
knees
when
i
mounted
the
bank
a
second
wave
broke
on
it
the
highest
part
of
the
bank
was
more
than
seventeen
feet
above
the
plain
as
i
climbed
up
the
bank
another
person
reached
it
from
the
opposite
side
who
she
was
every
fibre
of
my
body
knew
at
once
and
my
whole
soul
was
thrilled
with
the
consciousness
i
had
no
doubt
that
she
too
had
recognised
me
on
an
island
some
three
yards
in
area
stood
we
two
all
else
was
covered
with
water
it
was
a
time
of
cataclysm
the
stars
had
been
blotted
out
of
the
sky
all
the
lights
of
the
earth
had
been
darkened
there
would
have
been
no
harm
if
we
had
held
converse
but
we
could
not
bring
ourselves
to
utter
a
word
neither
of
us
made
even
a
formal
inquiry
after
the
other
health
only
we
stood
gazing
at
the
darkness
at
our
feet
swirled
the
dense
black
wild
roaring
torrent
of
death
surabala
has
come
to
side
leaving
the
whole
world
she
has
none
besides
in
our
childhood
this
surabala
had
come
from
some
dark
primeval
realm
of
mystery
from
a
life
in
another
orb
and
stood
by
my
side
on
this
luminous
peopled
earth
and
after
a
wide
span
of
time
she
has
left
that
earth
so
full
of
light
and
human
beings
to
stand
alone
by
side
amidst
this
terrible
desolate
gloom
of
nature
the
stream
of
birth
had
flung
that
tender
bud
before
me
and
the
flood
of
death
had
wafted
the
same
flower
now
in
full
bloom
to
and
to
none
else
one
more
wave
and
we
shall
be
swept
away
from
this
extreme
point
of
the
earth
torn
from
the
stalks
on
which
we
now
sit
apart
and
made
one
in
death
may
that
wave
never
come
may
surabala
live
long
and
happily
girt
round
by
husband
and
children
household
and
kinsfolk
this
one
night
standing
on
the
brink
of
nature
destruction
i
have
tasted
eternal
bliss
the
night
wore
out
the
tempest
ceased
the
flood
abated
without
a
word
spoken
surabala
went
back
to
her
house
and
i
too
returned
to
my
shed
without
having
uttered
a
word
i
reflected
true
i
have
become
no
or
head
clerk
nor
a
garibaldi
i
am
only
the
second
master
of
a
beggarly
school
but
one
night
had
for
its
brief
space
beamed
upon
my
whole
life
course
that
one
night
out
of
all
the
days
and
nights
of
my
allotted
span
has
been
the
supreme
glory
of
my
humble
existence
raja
and
rani
bipin
kisore
was
born
a
golden
spoon
in
his
mouth
hence
he
knew
how
to
squander
money
twice
as
well
as
how
to
earn
it
the
natural
result
was
that
he
could
not
live
long
in
the
house
where
he
was
born
he
was
a
delicate
young
man
of
comely
appearance
an
adept
in
music
a
fool
in
business
and
unfit
for
life
handicap
he
rolled
along
road
like
the
wheel
of
jagannath
car
he
could
not
long
command
his
wonted
style
of
magnificent
living
luckily
however
raja
chittaranjan
having
got
back
his
property
from
the
court
of
wards
was
intent
upon
organising
an
amateur
theatre
party
captivated
by
the
prepossessing
looks
of
bipin
kisore
and
his
musical
endowments
the
raja
gladly
him
of
his
crew
chittaranjan
was
a
he
was
not
given
to
any
excesses
though
the
son
of
a
rich
man
he
used
to
dine
and
sleep
at
appointed
hours
and
even
at
appointed
places
and
he
suddenly
became
enamoured
of
bipin
like
one
unto
drink
often
did
meals
cool
and
nights
grow
old
while
he
listened
to
bipin
and
discussed
with
him
the
merits
of
operatic
compositions
the
dewan
remarked
that
the
only
blemish
in
the
otherwise
perfect
character
of
his
master
was
his
inordinate
fondness
for
bipin
kisore
rani
basanta
kumari
raved
at
her
husband
and
said
that
he
was
wasting
himself
on
a
luckless
baboon
the
sooner
she
could
do
away
with
him
the
easier
she
would
feel
the
raja
was
much
pleased
in
his
heart
at
this
seeming
jealousy
of
his
youthful
wife
he
smiled
and
thought
that
know
only
one
man
upon
the
earth
him
whom
they
love
and
never
think
of
other
men
deserts
that
there
may
be
many
whose
merits
deserve
regard
is
not
recorded
in
the
scriptures
of
women
the
only
good
man
and
the
only
object
of
a
woman
favours
is
he
who
has
blabbered
into
her
ears
the
matrimonial
incantations
a
little
moment
behind
the
usual
hour
of
her
husband
meals
is
a
world
of
anxiety
to
her
but
she
never
cares
a
brass
button
if
her
husband
dependents
have
a
mouthful
or
not
this
inconsiderate
partiality
of
the
softer
sex
might
be
cavilled
at
but
to
chittaranjan
it
did
not
seem
unpleasant
thus
he
would
often
indulge
in
hyperbolic
laudations
of
bipin
in
his
presence
just
to
provoke
a
display
of
her
delightful
fulminations
but
what
was
sport
to
the
couple
was
death
to
poor
bipin
the
servants
of
the
house
as
is
their
wont
took
their
cue
from
the
rani
apathetic
and
wilful
neglect
of
the
wretched
and
grew
more
apathetic
and
wilful
still
they
contrived
to
forget
to
look
after
his
comforts
to
bipin
infinite
chagrin
and
untold
sufferings
once
the
rani
rebuked
the
servant
puté
and
said
are
always
shirking
work
what
do
you
do
all
through
the
day
madam
the
whole
day
is
taken
up
in
serving
bipin
babu
under
the
orders
stammered
the
poor
valet
the
rani
retorted
bipin
babu
is
a
great
nawab
eh
this
was
enough
for
puté
he
took
the
hint
from
the
very
next
day
he
left
bipin
babu
orts
as
they
were
and
at
times
forgot
to
cover
the
food
for
him
with
unpractised
hands
bipin
often
scoured
his
own
dishes
and
not
unfrequently
went
without
meals
but
it
was
not
in
him
to
whine
and
report
to
the
raja
it
was
not
in
him
to
lower
himself
by
petty
squabblings
with
menials
he
did
not
mind
it
he
took
everything
in
good
part
and
thus
while
the
raja
favours
grew
the
rani
disfavour
intensified
and
at
last
knew
no
bounds
now
the
opera
of
was
ready
after
due
rehearsal
the
stage
was
fitted
up
in
the
palace
the
raja
acted
the
part
of
and
bipin
that
of
oh
how
sweetly
he
sang
how
beautiful
he
looked
the
audience
applauded
in
transports
of
joy
the
play
over
the
raja
came
to
the
rani
and
asked
her
how
she
liked
it
the
rani
replied
bipin
acted
the
part
of
arjuna
gloriously
he
does
look
like
the
scion
of
a
noble
family
his
voice
is
rare
the
raja
said
jocosely
how
do
i
look
am
i
not
fair
have
i
not
a
sweet
voice
yours
is
different
case
added
the
rani
and
again
fell
to
dilating
on
the
histrionic
abilities
of
bipin
kisore
the
tables
were
now
turned
he
who
used
to
praise
now
began
to
deprecate
the
raja
who
was
never
weary
of
indulging
in
panegyrics
of
bipin
before
his
consort
now
suddenly
fell
reflecting
that
after
all
unthinking
people
made
too
much
of
bipin
actual
merits
what
was
extraordinary
about
his
appearance
or
voice
a
short
while
before
he
himself
was
one
of
those
unthinking
men
but
in
a
sudden
and
mysterious
way
he
developed
symptoms
of
thoughtfulness
from
the
day
following
every
good
arrangement
was
made
for
meals
the
rani
told
the
raja
is
undoubtedly
wrong
to
lodge
bipin
babu
with
the
petty
officers
of
the
raj
in
the
kachari
for
all
he
now
is
he
was
once
a
man
of
means
the
raja
ejaculated
curtly
and
turned
the
subject
the
rani
proposed
that
there
might
be
another
performance
on
the
occasion
of
the
ceremony
of
the
weanling
the
raja
heard
and
heard
her
not
generally
anglicised
as
offices
and
courts
once
on
being
reprimanded
by
the
raja
for
not
properly
laying
his
cloth
the
servant
puté
replied
can
i
do
according
to
the
rani
behests
i
have
to
look
after
bipin
babu
and
wait
on
him
the
livelong
day
this
angered
the
raja
and
he
exclaimed
highly
nettled
bipin
babu
is
a
veritable
nawab
i
see
ca
he
cleanse
his
own
dishes
himself
the
servant
as
before
took
his
cue
and
bipin
lapsed
back
into
his
former
wretchedness
the
rani
liked
bipin
songs
they
were
sweet
there
was
no
gainsaying
it
when
her
husband
sat
with
bipin
to
the
wonted
discourses
of
sweet
music
of
an
evening
she
would
listen
from
behind
the
screen
in
an
adjoining
room
not
long
afterwards
the
raja
began
again
his
old
habit
of
dining
and
sleeping
at
regular
hours
the
music
came
to
an
end
bipin
evening
services
were
no
more
needed
raja
chittaranjan
used
to
look
after
his
affairs
at
noon
one
day
he
came
earlier
to
the
zenana
and
found
his
consort
reading
something
on
his
asking
her
what
she
read
the
rani
was
a
little
taken
aback
but
promptly
replied
am
conning
over
a
few
songs
from
bipin
babu
we
have
not
had
any
music
since
you
tired
abruptly
of
your
musical
hobby
poor
woman
it
was
she
who
had
herself
made
no
end
of
efforts
to
eradicate
the
hobby
from
her
husband
mind
on
the
morrow
the
raja
dismissed
bipin
without
a
thought
as
to
how
and
where
the
poor
fellow
would
get
a
morsel
henceforth
nor
was
this
the
only
matter
of
regret
to
bipin
he
had
been
bound
to
the
raja
by
the
dearest
and
most
sincere
tie
of
attachment
he
served
him
more
for
affection
than
for
pay
he
was
fonder
of
his
friend
than
of
the
wages
he
received
even
after
deep
cogitation
bipin
could
not
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
raja
sudden
estrangement
fate
all
is
fate
bipin
said
to
himself
and
then
silently
and
bravely
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
picked
up
his
old
guitar
put
it
up
in
the
case
paid
the
last
two
coins
in
his
pocket
as
a
farewell
to
puté
and
walked
out
into
the
wide
wide
world
where
he
had
not
a
soul
to
call
his
friend
the
trust
property
i
brindaban
kundu
came
to
his
father
in
a
rage
and
said
am
off
this
moment
wretch
sneered
the
father
jaganath
kundu
you
have
paid
me
back
all
that
i
have
spent
on
your
food
and
clothing
it
will
be
time
enough
to
give
yourself
these
airs
such
food
and
clothing
as
was
customary
in
jaganath
household
could
not
have
cost
very
much
our
of
old
managed
to
feed
and
clothe
themselves
on
an
incredibly
small
outlay
jaganath
behaviour
showed
that
his
ideal
in
these
respects
was
equally
high
that
he
could
not
fully
live
up
to
it
was
due
partly
to
the
bad
influence
of
the
degenerate
society
around
him
and
partly
to
certain
unreasonable
demands
of
nature
in
her
attempt
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
so
long
as
brindaban
was
single
things
went
smoothly
enough
but
after
his
marriage
he
began
to
depart
from
the
high
and
rarefied
standard
cherished
by
his
sire
it
was
clear
that
the
son
ideas
of
comfort
were
moving
away
from
the
spiritual
to
the
material
and
imitating
the
ways
of
the
world
he
was
unwilling
to
put
up
with
the
discomforts
of
heat
and
cold
thirst
and
hunger
his
minimum
of
food
and
clothing
rose
apace
frequent
were
the
quarrels
between
the
father
and
the
son
at
last
brindaban
wife
became
seriously
ill
and
a
was
called
in
but
when
the
doctor
prescribed
a
costly
medicine
for
his
patient
jaganath
took
it
as
a
proof
of
sheer
incompetence
and
turned
him
out
immediately
at
first
brindaban
besought
his
father
to
allow
the
treatment
to
continue
then
he
quarrelled
with
him
about
it
but
to
no
purpose
when
his
wife
died
he
abused
his
father
and
called
him
a
murderer
country
doctor
unqualified
by
any
medical
training
said
the
father
people
die
even
after
swallowing
all
kinds
of
drugs
if
costly
medicines
could
save
life
how
is
it
that
kings
and
emperors
are
not
immortal
you
do
expect
your
wife
to
die
with
more
pomp
and
ceremony
than
did
your
mother
and
your
grandmother
before
her
do
you
brindaban
might
really
have
derived
a
great
consolation
from
these
words
had
he
not
been
overwhelmed
with
grief
and
incapable
of
proper
thinking
neither
his
mother
nor
his
grandmother
had
taken
any
medicine
before
making
their
exit
from
this
world
and
this
was
the
custom
of
the
family
but
alas
the
younger
generation
was
unwilling
to
die
according
to
ancient
custom
the
english
had
newly
come
to
the
country
at
the
time
we
speak
of
even
in
those
remote
days
the
good
old
folks
were
horrified
at
the
unorthodox
ways
of
the
new
generation
and
sat
speechless
trying
to
draw
comfort
from
their
be
that
as
it
may
the
modern
brindaban
said
to
his
old
fogy
of
a
father
am
off
the
father
instantly
agreed
and
wished
publicly
that
should
he
ever
give
his
son
one
single
pice
in
future
the
gods
might
reckon
his
act
as
shedding
the
holy
blood
of
cows
brindaban
in
his
turn
similarly
wished
that
should
he
ever
accept
anything
from
his
father
his
act
might
be
held
as
bad
as
matricide
the
people
of
the
village
looked
upon
this
small
revolution
as
a
great
relief
after
a
long
period
of
monotony
and
when
jaganath
disinherited
his
only
son
every
one
did
his
best
to
console
him
all
were
unanimous
in
the
opinion
that
to
quarrel
with
a
father
for
the
sake
of
a
wife
was
possible
only
in
these
degenerate
days
and
the
reason
they
gave
was
sound
too
your
wife
dies
they
said
can
find
a
second
one
without
delay
but
when
your
father
dies
you
ca
get
another
to
replace
him
for
love
or
money
their
logic
no
doubt
was
perfect
but
we
suspect
that
the
utter
hopelessness
of
getting
another
father
did
not
trouble
the
misguided
son
very
much
on
the
contrary
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
mercy
nor
did
separation
from
brindaban
weigh
heavily
on
the
mind
of
his
father
in
the
first
place
his
absence
from
home
reduced
the
household
expenses
then
again
the
father
was
freed
from
a
great
anxiety
the
fear
of
being
poisoned
by
his
son
and
heir
had
always
haunted
him
when
he
ate
his
scanty
fare
he
could
never
banish
the
thought
of
poison
from
his
mind
this
fear
had
abated
somewhat
after
the
death
of
his
and
now
that
the
son
was
gone
it
disappeared
altogether
but
there
was
one
tender
spot
in
the
old
man
heart
brindaban
had
taken
away
with
him
his
son
gokul
chandra
now
the
expense
of
keeping
the
child
was
comparatively
small
and
so
affection
for
him
was
without
a
drawback
still
when
brindaban
took
him
away
his
grief
sincere
as
it
was
was
mingled
at
first
with
calculation
as
to
how
much
he
would
save
a
month
by
the
absence
of
the
two
how
much
the
sum
would
come
to
in
the
year
and
what
would
be
the
capital
to
bring
it
in
as
interest
but
the
empty
house
without
gokul
chandra
in
it
to
make
mischief
became
more
and
more
difficult
for
the
old
man
to
live
in
there
was
no
one
now
to
play
tricks
upon
him
when
he
was
engaged
in
his
no
one
to
snatch
away
his
food
and
eat
it
no
one
to
run
away
with
his
inkpot
when
he
was
writing
up
his
accounts
his
daily
routine
of
life
now
uninterrupted
became
an
intolerable
burden
to
him
he
bethought
him
that
this
unworried
peace
was
endurable
only
in
the
world
to
come
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
holes
made
in
his
quilt
by
his
grandchild
and
the
sketches
executed
by
the
same
artist
on
his
his
heart
was
heavy
with
grief
once
upon
a
time
he
had
reproached
the
boy
bitterly
because
he
had
torn
his
into
pieces
within
the
short
space
of
two
years
now
tears
stood
in
jaganath
eyes
as
he
gazed
upon
the
dirty
remnants
lying
in
the
bedroom
he
carefully
put
them
away
in
his
safe
and
registered
a
vow
that
should
gokul
ever
come
back
again
he
should
not
be
reprimanded
even
if
he
destroyed
one
a
year
a
ceremonial
worship
but
gokul
did
not
return
and
poor
jaganath
aged
rapidly
his
empty
home
seemed
emptier
every
day
no
longer
could
the
old
man
stay
peacefully
at
home
even
in
the
middle
of
the
day
when
all
respectable
folks
in
the
village
enjoyed
their
siesta
jaganath
might
be
seen
roaming
over
the
village
in
hand
the
boys
at
sight
of
him
would
give
up
their
play
and
retiring
in
a
body
to
a
safe
distance
chant
verses
composed
by
a
local
poet
praising
the
old
gentleman
economical
habits
no
one
ventured
to
say
his
real
name
lest
he
should
have
to
go
without
his
meal
that
day
and
so
people
gave
him
names
after
their
own
fancy
elderly
people
called
him
jaganash
but
the
reason
why
the
younger
generation
preferred
to
call
him
a
vampire
was
hard
to
guess
it
may
be
that
the
bloodless
skin
of
the
old
man
had
some
physical
resemblance
to
the
vampire
it
is
a
superstition
current
in
bengal
that
if
a
man
pronounces
the
name
of
a
very
miserly
individual
he
has
to
go
without
his
meal
that
day
jaganath
is
the
lord
of
festivity
and
would
mean
the
despoiler
of
it
ii
one
afternoon
when
jaganath
was
rambling
as
usual
through
the
village
lanes
shaded
by
mango
topes
he
saw
a
boy
apparently
a
stranger
assuming
the
captaincy
of
the
village
boys
and
explaining
to
them
the
scheme
of
some
new
prank
won
by
the
force
of
his
character
and
the
startling
novelty
of
his
ideas
the
boys
had
all
sworn
allegiance
to
him
unlike
the
others
he
did
not
run
away
from
the
old
man
as
he
approached
but
came
quite
close
to
him
and
began
to
shake
his
own
the
result
was
that
a
live
lizard
sprang
out
of
it
on
to
the
old
man
body
ran
down
his
back
and
off
towards
the
jungle
sudden
fright
made
the
poor
man
shiver
from
head
to
foot
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
other
boys
who
shouted
with
glee
before
jaganath
had
gone
far
cursing
and
swearing
the
on
his
shoulder
suddenly
disappeared
and
the
next
moment
it
was
seen
on
the
head
of
the
new
boy
transformed
into
a
turban
the
novel
attentions
of
this
manikin
came
as
a
great
relief
to
jaganath
it
was
long
since
any
boy
had
taken
such
freedom
with
him
after
a
good
deal
of
coaxing
and
many
fair
promises
he
at
last
persuaded
the
boy
to
come
to
him
and
this
was
the
conversation
which
followed
your
name
my
boy
pal
your
home
tell
your
father
tell
wo
you
i
have
run
away
from
home
made
you
do
it
father
wanted
to
send
me
to
school
it
occurred
to
jaganath
that
it
would
be
useless
extravagance
to
send
such
a
boy
to
school
and
his
father
must
have
been
an
unpractical
fool
not
to
have
thought
so
well
said
jaganath
would
you
like
to
come
and
stay
with
me
mind
said
the
boy
and
forthwith
he
installed
himself
in
jaganath
house
he
felt
as
little
hesitation
as
though
it
were
the
shadow
of
a
tree
by
the
wayside
and
not
only
that
he
began
to
proclaim
his
wishes
as
regards
his
food
and
clothing
with
such
coolness
that
you
would
have
thought
he
had
paid
his
reckoning
in
full
beforehand
and
when
anything
went
wrong
he
did
not
scruple
to
quarrel
with
the
old
man
it
had
been
easy
enough
for
jaganath
to
get
the
better
of
his
own
child
but
now
where
another
man
child
was
concerned
he
had
to
acknowledge
defeat
iii
the
people
of
the
village
marvelled
when
nitai
pal
was
unexpectedly
made
so
much
of
by
jaganath
they
felt
sure
that
the
old
man
end
was
near
and
the
prospect
of
his
bequeathing
all
his
property
to
this
unknown
brat
made
their
hearts
sore
furious
with
envy
they
determined
to
do
the
boy
an
injury
but
the
old
man
took
care
of
him
as
though
he
was
a
rib
in
his
breast
at
times
the
boy
threatened
that
he
would
go
away
and
the
old
man
used
to
say
to
him
temptingly
will
leave
you
all
the
property
i
possess
young
as
he
was
the
boy
fully
understood
the
grandeur
of
this
promise
the
village
people
then
began
to
make
inquiries
after
the
father
of
the
boy
their
hearts
melted
with
compassion
for
the
agonised
parents
and
they
declared
that
the
son
must
be
a
rascal
to
cause
them
so
much
suffering
they
heaped
abuses
on
his
head
but
the
heat
with
which
they
did
it
betrayed
envy
rather
than
a
sense
of
justice
one
day
the
old
man
learned
from
a
wayfarer
that
one
damodar
pal
was
seeking
his
lost
son
and
was
even
now
coming
towards
the
village
nitai
when
he
heard
this
became
very
restless
and
was
ready
to
run
away
leaving
his
future
wealth
to
take
care
of
itself
jaganath
reassured
him
saying
mean
to
hide
you
where
nobody
can
find
you
not
even
the
village
people
themselves
this
whetted
the
curiosity
of
the
boy
and
he
said
where
do
show
me
will
know
if
i
show
you
now
wait
till
it
is
night
said
jaganath
the
hope
of
discovering
the
mysterious
delighted
nitai
he
planned
to
himself
how
as
soon
as
his
father
had
gone
away
without
him
he
would
have
a
bet
with
his
comrades
and
play
nobody
would
be
able
to
find
him
would
it
be
fun
his
father
too
would
ransack
the
whole
village
and
not
find
him
that
would
be
rare
fun
also
at
noon
jaganath
shut
the
boy
up
in
his
house
and
disappeared
for
some
time
when
he
came
home
again
nitai
worried
him
with
questions
no
sooner
was
it
dark
than
nitai
said
shall
we
go
now
is
night
yet
replied
jaganath
a
little
while
later
the
boy
exclaimed
is
night
now
grandfather
come
let
go
village
people
have
gone
to
bed
yet
whispered
jaganath
nitai
waited
but
a
moment
and
said
have
gone
to
bed
now
grandfather
i
am
sure
they
have
let
start
now
the
night
advanced
sleep
began
to
weigh
heavily
on
the
eyelids
of
the
poor
boy
and
it
was
a
hard
struggle
for
him
to
keep
awake
at
midnight
jaganath
caught
hold
of
the
boy
arm
and
left
the
house
groping
through
the
dark
lanes
of
the
sleeping
village
not
a
sound
disturbed
the
stillness
except
the
occasional
howl
of
a
dog
when
all
the
other
dogs
far
and
near
would
join
in
chorus
or
perhaps
the
flapping
of
a
scared
by
the
sound
of
human
footsteps
at
that
unusual
hour
nitai
trembled
with
fear
and
held
jaganath
fast
by
the
arm
across
many
a
field
they
went
and
at
last
came
to
a
jungle
where
stood
a
dilapidated
temple
without
a
god
in
it
here
exclaimed
nitai
in
a
tone
of
disappointment
it
was
nothing
like
what
he
had
imagined
there
was
not
much
mystery
about
it
often
since
running
away
from
home
he
had
passed
nights
in
deserted
temples
like
this
it
was
not
a
bad
place
for
playing
still
it
was
quite
possible
that
his
comrades
might
track
him
there
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
inside
jaganath
removed
a
slab
of
stone
and
an
underground
room
with
a
lamp
burning
in
it
was
revealed
to
the
astonished
eyes
of
the
boy
fear
and
curiosity
assailed
his
little
heart
jaganath
descended
by
a
ladder
and
nitai
followed
him
looking
around
the
boy
saw
that
there
were
brass
on
all
sides
of
him
in
the
middle
lay
spread
an
and
in
front
of
it
were
arranged
vermilion
sandal
paste
flowers
and
other
articles
of
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
the
boy
dipped
his
hand
into
some
of
the
and
drew
out
their
contents
they
were
rupees
and
gold
a
holding
about
three
gallons
of
water
a
prayer
carpet
jaganath
addressing
the
boy
said
told
you
nitai
that
i
would
give
you
all
my
money
i
have
not
got
much
these
are
all
that
i
possess
these
i
will
make
over
to
you
the
boy
jumped
with
delight
he
exclaimed
wo
take
back
a
rupee
will
you
i
do
said
the
old
man
in
solemn
tones
my
hand
be
attacked
with
leprosy
but
there
is
one
condition
if
ever
my
grandson
gokul
chandra
or
his
son
or
his
grandson
or
his
or
any
of
his
progeny
should
happen
to
pass
this
way
then
you
must
make
over
to
him
or
to
them
every
rupee
and
every
here
the
boy
thought
that
the
old
man
was
raving
well
he
replied
sit
on
this
said
jaganath
for
will
be
done
to
you
why
said
the
boy
taken
aback
is
the
rule
the
boy
squatted
on
the
as
he
was
told
jaganath
smeared
his
forehead
with
sandal
paste
put
a
mark
of
vermilion
between
his
eyebrows
flung
a
garland
of
flowers
round
his
neck
and
began
to
recite
incantations
to
sit
there
like
a
god
and
hear
recited
made
poor
nitai
feel
very
uneasy
he
whispered
but
jaganath
did
not
reply
and
went
on
muttering
his
incantations
finally
with
great
difficulty
he
dragged
each
before
the
boy
and
made
him
repeat
the
following
vow
after
him
do
solemnly
promise
that
i
will
make
over
all
this
treasure
to
gokul
chandra
kundu
the
son
of
brindaban
kundu
the
grandson
of
jaganath
kundu
or
to
the
son
or
to
the
grandson
or
to
the
of
the
said
gokul
chandra
kundu
or
to
any
other
progeny
of
his
who
may
be
the
rightful
heir
the
boy
repeated
this
over
and
over
again
until
he
felt
stupefied
and
his
tongue
began
to
grow
stiff
in
his
mouth
when
the
ceremony
was
over
the
air
of
the
cave
was
laden
with
the
smoke
of
the
earthen
lamp
and
the
of
the
two
the
boy
felt
that
the
roof
of
his
mouth
had
become
dry
as
dust
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
burning
he
was
nearly
suffocated
the
lamp
became
dimmer
and
dimmer
and
then
went
out
altogether
in
the
total
darkness
that
followed
nitai
could
hear
the
old
man
climbing
up
the
ladder
where
are
you
going
to
said
he
greatly
distressed
am
going
now
replied
jaganath
remain
here
no
one
will
be
able
to
find
you
remember
the
name
gokul
chandra
the
son
of
brindaban
and
the
grandson
of
jaganath
he
then
withdrew
the
ladder
in
a
stifled
agonised
voice
the
boy
implored
want
to
go
back
to
father
jaganath
replaced
the
slab
he
then
knelt
down
and
placed
his
ear
on
the
stone
nitai
voice
was
heard
once
more
and
then
came
a
sound
of
some
heavy
object
falling
with
a
bump
and
then
everything
was
still
having
thus
placed
his
wealth
in
the
hands
of
a
jaganath
began
to
cover
up
the
stone
with
earth
then
he
piled
broken
bricks
and
loose
mortar
over
it
on
the
top
of
all
he
planted
turfs
of
grass
and
jungle
weeds
the
night
was
almost
spent
but
he
could
not
tear
himself
away
from
the
spot
now
and
again
he
placed
his
ear
to
the
ground
and
tried
to
listen
it
seemed
to
him
that
from
far
far
below
from
the
abysmal
depth
of
the
earth
interior
came
a
wailing
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
was
flooded
with
that
one
sound
that
the
sleeping
humanity
of
all
the
world
was
awake
and
was
sitting
on
its
beds
trying
to
listen
or
is
a
supernatural
being
described
in
sanskrit
mythology
and
poetry
in
bengal
has
come
to
mean
a
ghostly
custodian
of
treasure
under
such
circumstances
as
in
this
story
the
old
man
in
his
frenzy
kept
on
heaping
earth
higher
and
higher
he
wanted
somehow
to
stifle
that
sound
but
still
he
fancied
he
could
hear
he
struck
the
spot
with
all
his
might
and
said
quiet
people
might
hear
you
but
still
he
imagined
he
heard
the
sun
lighted
up
the
eastern
horizon
jaganath
then
left
the
temple
and
came
into
the
open
fields
there
too
somebody
called
out
startled
at
the
sound
he
turned
back
and
saw
his
son
at
his
heels
said
brindaban
hear
my
boy
is
hiding
himself
in
your
house
i
must
have
him
back
with
eyes
dilated
and
distorted
mouth
the
old
man
leaned
forward
and
exclaimed
boy
my
boy
gokul
he
is
nitai
pal
now
and
i
myself
go
by
the
name
of
damodar
pal
your
has
spread
so
widely
in
the
neighbourhood
that
we
were
obliged
to
cover
up
our
origin
lest
people
should
have
refused
to
pronounce
our
names
slowly
the
old
man
lifted
both
his
arms
above
his
head
his
fingers
began
to
twitch
convulsively
as
though
he
was
trying
to
catch
hold
of
some
imaginary
object
in
the
air
he
then
fell
on
the
ground
when
he
came
to
his
senses
again
he
dragged
his
son
towards
the
ruined
temple
when
they
were
both
inside
it
he
said
you
hear
any
wailing
sound
i
do
said
brindaban
listen
very
carefully
do
you
hear
anybody
calling
out
father
this
seemed
to
relieve
him
greatly
from
that
day
forward
he
used
to
go
about
asking
people
you
hear
any
wailing
sound
they
laughed
at
the
raving
dotard
about
four
years
later
jaganath
lay
on
his
when
the
light
of
this
world
was
gradually
fading
away
from
his
eyes
and
his
breathing
became
more
and
more
difficult
he
suddenly
sat
up
in
a
state
of
delirium
throwing
both
his
hands
in
the
air
he
seemed
to
grope
about
for
something
muttering
who
has
removed
my
ladder
unable
to
find
the
ladder
to
climb
out
of
his
terrible
dungeon
where
there
was
no
light
to
see
and
no
air
to
breathe
he
fell
on
his
bed
once
more
and
disappeared
into
that
region
where
no
one
has
ever
been
found
out
in
the
world
eternal
game
of
the
incidents
described
in
this
story
now
happily
a
thing
of
the
past
were
by
no
means
rare
in
bengal
at
one
time
our
author
however
slightly
departs
from
the
current
accounts
such
criminally
superstitious
practices
were
resorted
to
by
miserly
persons
under
the
idea
that
they
themselves
would
the
treasure
in
a
future
state
of
existence
you
see
me
in
a
future
birth
passing
this
way
you
must
make
over
all
this
treasure
to
me
guard
it
till
then
and
stir
not
was
the
usual
promise
exacted
from
the
victim
before
he
became
many
were
the
stories
we
heard
in
childhood
of
people
becoming
suddenly
rich
by
coming
across
ghostly
custodians
of
wealth
belonging
to
them
in
a
past
birth
the
riddle
solved
i
krishna
gopal
sircar
zemindar
of
jhikrakota
made
over
his
estates
to
his
eldest
son
and
retired
to
kasi
as
befits
a
good
hindu
to
spend
the
evening
of
his
life
in
religious
devotion
all
the
poor
and
the
destitute
of
the
neighbourhood
were
in
tears
at
the
parting
every
one
declared
that
such
piety
and
benevolence
were
rare
in
these
degenerate
days
his
son
bipin
bihari
was
a
young
man
well
educated
after
the
modern
fashion
and
had
taken
the
degree
of
bachelor
of
arts
he
sported
a
pair
of
spectacles
wore
a
beard
and
seldom
mixed
with
others
his
private
life
was
unsullied
he
did
not
smoke
and
never
touched
cards
he
was
a
man
of
stern
disposition
though
he
looked
soft
and
pliable
this
trait
of
his
character
soon
came
home
to
his
tenantry
in
diverse
ways
unlike
his
father
he
would
on
no
account
allow
the
remission
of
one
single
pice
out
of
the
rents
justly
due
to
him
in
no
circumstances
would
he
grant
any
tenant
one
single
day
grace
in
paying
up
on
taking
over
the
management
of
the
property
bipin
bihari
discovered
that
his
father
had
allowed
a
large
number
of
brahmins
to
hold
land
entirely
and
a
larger
number
at
rents
much
below
the
prevailing
rates
his
father
was
incapable
of
resisting
the
importunate
solicitation
of
others
such
was
the
weakness
of
his
character
bipin
bihari
said
this
could
never
be
he
could
not
abandon
the
income
of
half
his
property
and
he
reasoned
with
himself
thus
the
persons
who
were
in
actual
enjoyment
of
the
concessions
and
getting
fat
at
his
expense
were
a
lot
of
worthless
people
and
wholly
undeserving
of
charity
charity
bestowed
on
such
objects
only
encouraged
idleness
living
nowadays
had
become
much
costlier
than
in
the
days
of
his
ancestors
wants
had
increased
apace
for
a
gentleman
to
keep
up
his
position
had
become
four
times
as
expensive
as
in
days
past
so
he
could
not
afford
to
scatter
gifts
right
and
left
as
his
father
had
done
on
the
contrary
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
call
back
as
many
of
them
as
he
possibly
could
so
bipin
bihari
lost
no
time
in
carrying
into
effect
what
he
conceived
to
be
his
duty
he
was
a
man
of
strict
principles
what
had
gone
out
of
his
grasp
returned
to
him
little
by
little
only
a
very
small
portion
of
his
father
grants
did
he
allow
to
remain
undisturbed
and
he
took
good
care
to
arrange
that
even
those
should
not
be
deemed
permanent
the
wails
of
the
tenants
reached
krishna
gopal
at
benares
through
the
post
some
even
made
a
journey
to
that
place
to
represent
their
grievances
to
him
in
person
krishna
gopal
wrote
to
his
son
intimating
his
displeasure
bipin
bihari
replied
pointing
out
that
the
times
had
changed
in
former
days
he
said
the
was
compensated
for
the
gifts
he
made
by
the
many
customary
presents
he
received
from
his
tenantry
recent
statutes
had
made
all
such
impositions
illegal
the
had
now
to
rest
content
with
just
the
stipulated
rent
and
nothing
more
he
continued
keep
a
strict
watch
over
the
payment
of
our
just
dues
what
will
be
left
to
us
since
the
tenants
wo
give
us
anything
extra
now
how
can
we
allow
them
concessions
our
relations
must
henceforth
be
strictly
commercial
we
shall
be
ruined
if
we
go
on
making
gifts
and
endowments
and
the
preservation
of
our
property
and
the
keeping
up
of
our
position
will
be
rendered
very
difficult
krishna
gopal
became
uneasy
at
finding
that
times
should
have
changed
so
much
well
he
murmured
to
himself
younger
generation
knows
best
i
suppose
our
methods
do
now
if
i
interfere
my
son
might
refuse
to
manage
the
property
and
insist
on
my
going
back
no
thank
you
i
would
rather
not
i
prefer
to
devote
the
few
days
that
are
left
me
to
the
service
of
my
god
ii
so
things
went
on
bipin
bihari
put
his
affairs
in
order
after
much
litigation
in
the
courts
and
by
less
constitutional
methods
outside
most
of
the
tenants
submitted
to
his
will
out
of
fear
only
a
fellow
called
asimuddin
son
of
mirza
bibi
remained
refractory
bipin
displeasure
was
keenest
against
this
man
he
could
quite
understand
his
father
having
granted
lands
to
brahmins
but
why
this
mohammedan
should
be
holding
so
much
land
some
free
and
some
at
rents
lower
than
the
prevailing
rates
was
a
riddle
to
him
and
what
was
he
the
son
of
a
low
mohammedan
widow
giving
himself
airs
and
defying
the
whole
world
simply
because
he
had
learnt
to
read
and
write
a
little
at
the
village
school
to
bipin
it
was
intolerable
he
made
inquiries
of
his
clerks
about
asimuddin
holdings
all
that
they
could
tell
him
was
that
babu
krishna
gopal
himself
had
made
these
grants
to
the
family
many
years
back
but
they
had
no
idea
as
to
what
his
motive
might
have
been
they
imagined
however
that
perhaps
the
widow
won
the
compassion
of
the
by
representing
to
him
her
woe
and
misery
to
bipin
these
favours
seemed
to
be
utterly
undeserved
he
had
not
seen
the
pitiable
condition
of
these
people
in
days
gone
by
their
comparative
ease
at
the
present
day
and
their
arrogance
drove
him
to
the
conclusion
that
they
had
impudently
swindled
his
father
out
of
a
part
of
his
lawful
income
asimuddin
was
a
sort
of
a
fellow
too
he
vowed
that
he
would
lay
down
his
life
sooner
than
give
up
an
inch
of
his
land
then
came
open
hostilities
the
poor
old
widow
tried
her
best
to
pacify
her
son
is
no
good
fighting
with
the
she
would
often
say
to
him
kindness
has
kept
us
alive
so
long
let
us
depend
upon
him
still
though
he
may
curtail
his
favours
surrender
to
him
part
of
the
lands
as
he
desires
mother
protested
asimuddin
do
you
know
of
these
matters
pray
one
by
one
asimuddin
lost
the
cases
instituted
against
him
the
more
he
lost
the
more
his
obstinacy
increased
for
the
sake
of
his
all
he
staked
all
that
was
his
one
afternoon
mirza
bibi
collected
some
fruits
and
vegetables
from
her
little
garden
and
unknown
to
her
son
went
and
sought
an
interview
with
bipin
babu
she
looked
at
him
with
a
tenderness
maternal
in
its
intensity
and
spoke
allah
bless
you
my
son
do
not
destroy
asim
it
would
be
right
of
you
to
your
charge
i
commit
him
take
him
as
though
he
were
one
whom
it
is
your
duty
to
support
as
though
he
were
a
younger
brother
of
yours
vast
is
your
wealth
do
grudge
him
a
small
particle
of
it
my
son
this
assumption
of
familiarity
on
the
part
of
the
garrulous
old
woman
annoyed
bipin
not
a
little
do
you
know
of
these
things
my
good
woman
he
condescended
to
say
you
have
any
representations
to
make
send
your
son
to
me
being
assured
for
the
second
time
that
she
knew
nothing
about
these
affairs
mirza
bibi
returned
home
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
apron
all
the
way
and
offering
her
silent
prayers
to
allah
iii
the
litigation
dragged
its
weary
length
from
the
criminal
to
the
civil
courts
and
thence
to
the
high
court
where
at
last
asimuddin
met
with
a
partial
success
eighteen
months
passed
in
this
way
but
he
was
a
ruined
man
now
plunged
in
debts
up
to
his
very
ears
his
creditors
took
this
opportunity
to
execute
the
decrees
they
had
obtained
against
him
a
date
was
fixed
for
putting
up
to
auction
every
stick
and
stone
that
he
had
left
it
was
monday
the
village
market
had
assembled
by
the
side
of
a
tiny
river
now
swollen
by
the
rains
buying
and
selling
were
going
on
partly
on
the
bank
and
partly
in
the
boats
moored
there
the
hubbub
was
great
among
the
commodities
for
sale
preponderated
it
being
the
month
of
fish
were
seen
in
large
quantities
also
the
sky
was
cloudy
many
of
the
apprehending
a
downpour
had
stretched
a
piece
of
cloth
overhead
across
bamboo
poles
put
up
for
the
purpose
asimuddin
had
come
too
but
he
had
not
a
copper
with
him
no
shopkeepers
allowed
him
credit
nowadays
he
therefore
had
brought
a
brass
and
a
with
him
these
he
would
pawn
and
then
buy
what
he
needed
plate
knife
towards
evening
bipin
babu
was
out
for
a
walk
attended
by
two
or
three
retainers
armed
with
attracted
by
the
noise
he
directed
his
steps
towards
the
market
on
his
arrival
he
stopped
awhile
before
the
stall
of
dwari
the
oilman
and
made
kindly
inquiries
about
his
business
all
on
a
sudden
asimuddin
raised
his
and
ran
towards
bipin
babu
roaring
like
a
tiger
the
market
people
caught
hold
of
him
and
quickly
disarmed
him
he
was
forthwith
given
in
custody
to
the
police
business
in
the
market
then
went
on
as
usual
stick
we
can
not
say
that
bipin
babu
was
not
inwardly
pleased
at
this
incident
it
is
intolerable
that
the
creature
we
are
hunting
down
should
turn
and
show
fight
bipin
chuckled
have
got
him
at
last
the
ladies
of
bipin
babu
house
when
they
heard
the
news
exclaimed
with
horror
the
ruffian
what
a
mercy
they
seized
him
in
time
they
found
consolation
in
the
prospect
of
the
man
being
punished
as
he
richly
deserved
in
another
part
of
the
village
the
same
evening
the
widow
humble
cottage
devoid
of
bread
and
bereft
of
her
son
became
darker
than
death
others
dismissed
the
incident
of
the
afternoon
from
their
minds
sat
down
to
their
meals
retired
to
bed
and
went
to
sleep
but
to
the
widow
the
event
loomed
larger
than
anything
else
in
this
wide
world
but
alas
who
was
there
to
combat
it
only
a
bundle
of
wearied
bones
and
a
helpless
mother
heart
trembling
with
fear
iv
three
days
have
passed
in
the
meanwhile
the
case
would
come
up
for
trial
before
a
deputy
magistrate
bipin
babu
would
have
to
be
examined
as
a
witness
never
before
this
did
a
of
jhikrakota
appear
in
the
but
bipin
did
not
mind
the
next
day
at
the
appointed
hour
bipin
babu
arrived
at
the
court
in
a
palanquin
in
great
state
he
wore
a
turban
on
his
head
and
a
dangled
on
his
breast
the
deputy
magistrate
invited
him
to
a
seat
on
the
daïs
beside
his
own
the
was
crowded
to
suffocation
so
great
a
sensation
had
not
been
witnessed
in
this
court
for
many
years
when
the
time
for
the
case
to
be
called
drew
near
a
came
and
whispered
something
in
bipin
babu
ear
he
got
up
very
agitated
and
walked
out
begging
the
deputy
magistrate
to
excuse
him
for
a
few
minutes
outside
he
saw
his
old
father
a
little
way
off
standing
under
a
tree
barefooted
and
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
a
string
of
beads
was
in
his
hand
his
slender
form
shone
with
a
gentle
lustre
and
tranquil
compassion
seemed
to
radiate
from
his
forehead
a
garment
with
the
name
of
krishna
printed
over
it
bipin
hampered
by
his
trousers
and
his
flowing
touched
his
father
feet
with
his
forehead
as
he
did
this
his
turban
came
off
and
kissed
his
nose
and
his
watch
popping
out
of
his
pocket
swung
to
and
fro
in
the
air
bipin
hurriedly
straightened
his
turban
and
begged
his
father
to
come
to
his
house
close
by
thank
you
krishna
gopal
replied
will
tell
you
here
what
i
have
got
to
say
a
curious
crowd
had
gathered
by
this
time
bipin
attendants
pushed
them
back
then
krishna
gopal
said
must
do
what
you
can
to
get
asim
acquitted
and
restore
him
the
lands
that
you
have
taken
away
from
him
it
for
this
father
said
bipin
very
much
surprised
you
have
come
all
the
way
from
benares
would
you
tell
me
why
you
have
made
these
people
the
objects
of
your
special
favour
would
you
gain
by
knowing
it
my
boy
but
bipin
persisted
is
only
this
father
he
went
on
have
revoked
many
a
grant
because
i
thought
the
tenants
were
not
deserving
there
were
many
brahmins
among
them
but
of
them
you
never
said
a
word
why
are
you
so
keen
about
these
mohammedans
now
after
all
that
has
happened
if
i
drop
this
case
against
asim
and
give
him
back
his
lands
what
shall
i
say
to
people
krishna
gopal
kept
silence
for
some
moments
then
passing
the
beads
through
his
shaky
fingers
with
rapidity
he
spoke
with
a
tremulous
voice
it
be
necessary
to
explain
your
conduct
to
people
you
may
tell
them
that
asimuddin
is
my
son
and
your
brother
exclaimed
bipin
in
painful
surprise
a
womb
so
my
son
was
the
calm
reply
bipin
stood
there
for
some
time
in
mute
astonishment
then
he
found
words
to
say
home
father
we
will
talk
about
it
afterwards
my
son
replied
the
old
man
once
relinquished
the
world
to
serve
my
god
i
can
not
go
home
again
i
return
hence
now
i
leave
you
to
do
what
your
sense
of
duty
may
suggest
he
then
blessed
his
son
and
checking
his
tears
with
difficulty
walked
off
with
tottering
steps
bipin
was
dumbfounded
not
knowing
what
to
say
nor
what
to
do
such
was
the
piety
of
the
older
generation
he
said
to
himself
he
reflected
with
pride
how
much
better
he
was
than
his
father
in
point
of
education
and
morality
this
was
the
result
he
concluded
of
not
having
a
principle
to
guide
one
actions
returning
to
the
court
he
saw
asimuddin
outside
between
two
constables
awaiting
his
trial
he
looked
emaciated
and
worn
out
his
lips
were
pale
and
dry
and
his
eyes
unnaturally
bright
a
dirty
piece
of
cloth
worn
to
shreds
covered
him
my
brother
bipin
shuddered
at
the
thought
the
deputy
magistrate
and
bipin
were
friends
and
the
case
ended
in
a
fiasco
in
a
few
days
asimuddin
was
restored
to
his
former
condition
why
all
this
happened
he
could
not
understand
the
village
people
were
greatly
surprised
also
however
the
news
of
krishna
gopal
arrival
just
before
the
trial
soon
got
abroad
people
began
to
exchange
meaning
glances
the
pleaders
in
their
shrewdness
guessed
the
whole
affair
one
of
them
ram
taran
babu
was
beholden
to
krishna
gopal
for
his
education
and
his
start
in
life
somehow
or
other
he
had
always
suspected
that
the
virtue
and
piety
of
his
benefactor
were
shams
now
he
was
fully
convinced
that
if
a
searching
inquiry
were
made
all
men
might
be
found
out
them
tell
their
beads
as
much
as
they
like
he
thought
with
glee
in
this
world
is
just
as
bad
as
myself
the
only
difference
between
a
good
and
a
bad
man
is
that
the
good
practise
dissimulation
while
the
bad
do
the
revelation
that
krishna
gopal
piety
benevolence
and
magnanimity
were
nothing
but
a
cloak
of
hypocrisy
settled
a
difficulty
that
had
oppressed
ram
taran
babu
for
many
years
by
what
process
of
reasoning
we
do
not
know
the
burden
of
gratitude
was
greatly
lifted
off
his
mind
it
was
a
vast
relief
to
him
the
elder
sister
i
having
described
at
length
the
misdeeds
of
an
unfortunate
wicked
tyrannical
husband
tara
the
woman
neighbour
in
the
village
very
shortly
declared
her
verdict
be
to
such
a
mouth
at
this
joygopal
babu
wife
felt
much
hurt
it
did
not
become
womankind
to
wish
in
any
circumstances
whatever
a
worse
species
of
fire
than
that
of
a
cigar
in
a
husband
mouth
when
therefore
she
mildly
disapproved
the
verdict
tara
cried
with
redoubled
vehemence
better
to
be
a
widow
seven
births
over
than
the
wife
of
such
a
husband
and
saying
this
she
broke
up
the
meeting
and
left
sasi
said
within
herself
ca
imagine
any
offence
in
a
husband
that
could
so
harden
the
heart
against
him
even
as
she
turned
the
matter
over
in
her
mind
all
the
tenderness
of
her
loving
soul
gushed
forth
towards
her
own
husband
now
abroad
throwing
herself
with
outstretched
arms
on
that
part
of
the
bed
whereon
her
husband
was
wont
to
lie
she
kissed
the
empty
pillow
caught
the
smell
of
her
head
and
shutting
the
door
brought
out
from
a
wooden
box
an
old
and
almost
faded
photograph
with
some
letters
in
his
handwriting
and
sat
gazing
upon
them
thus
she
passed
the
hushed
noontide
alone
in
her
room
musing
of
old
memories
and
shedding
tears
of
sadness
it
was
no
new
yoke
this
between
sasikala
and
joygopal
they
had
been
married
at
an
early
age
and
had
children
their
long
companionship
had
made
the
days
go
by
in
an
easy
commonplace
sort
of
way
on
neither
side
had
there
been
any
symptoms
of
excessive
passion
they
had
lived
together
nearly
sixteen
years
without
a
break
when
her
husband
was
suddenly
called
away
from
home
on
business
and
then
a
great
impulse
of
love
awoke
in
sasi
soul
as
separation
strained
the
tie
love
knot
grew
tighter
and
the
passion
whose
existence
sasi
had
not
felt
now
made
her
throb
with
pain
so
it
happened
that
after
so
many
long
years
and
at
such
an
age
and
being
the
mother
of
children
sasi
on
this
spring
noon
in
her
lonely
chamber
lying
on
the
bed
of
separation
began
to
dream
the
sweet
dream
of
a
bride
in
her
budding
youth
that
love
of
which
hitherto
she
had
been
unconscious
suddenly
aroused
her
with
its
murmuring
music
she
wandered
a
long
way
up
the
stream
and
saw
many
a
golden
mansion
and
many
a
grove
on
either
bank
but
no
foothold
could
she
find
now
amid
the
vanished
hopes
of
happiness
she
began
to
say
to
herself
that
when
next
she
met
her
husband
life
should
not
be
insipid
nor
should
the
spring
come
in
vain
how
very
often
in
idle
disputation
or
some
petty
quarrel
had
she
teased
her
husband
with
all
the
singleness
of
a
penitent
heart
she
vowed
that
she
would
never
show
impatience
again
never
oppose
her
husband
wishes
bear
all
his
commands
and
with
a
tender
heart
submit
to
whatever
he
wished
of
good
or
ill
for
the
husband
was
the
husband
was
the
dearest
object
of
love
the
husband
was
divine
sasikala
was
the
only
and
daughter
of
her
parents
for
this
reason
though
he
had
only
a
small
property
of
his
own
joygopal
had
no
anxieties
about
the
future
his
had
enough
to
support
them
in
a
village
with
royal
state
and
then
in
his
old
age
a
son
was
born
untimely
to
father
to
tell
the
truth
sasi
was
very
sore
in
her
mind
at
this
improper
and
unjust
action
of
her
parents
nor
was
joygopal
particularly
pleased
the
parents
love
centred
in
this
son
of
their
advanced
years
and
when
the
newly
arrived
diminutive
sleepy
seized
with
his
two
weak
tiny
fists
all
the
hopes
and
expectations
of
joygopal
joygopal
found
a
place
in
a
in
assam
his
friends
urged
him
to
look
for
employment
but
whether
out
of
a
general
feeling
of
resentment
or
knowing
the
chances
of
rapid
rise
in
a
joygopal
would
not
pay
heed
to
anybody
he
sent
his
wife
and
children
to
his
and
left
for
assam
it
was
the
first
separation
between
husband
and
wife
in
their
married
life
this
incident
made
sasikala
very
angry
with
her
baby
brother
the
soreness
which
may
not
pass
the
lips
is
felt
the
more
keenly
within
when
the
little
fellow
sucked
and
slept
at
his
ease
his
big
sister
found
a
hundred
reasons
such
as
the
rice
is
cold
the
boys
are
too
late
for
school
to
worry
herself
and
others
day
and
night
with
her
petulant
humours
but
in
a
short
time
the
child
mother
died
before
her
death
she
committed
her
infant
son
to
her
daughter
care
then
did
the
motherless
child
easily
conquer
his
sister
heart
with
loud
whoops
he
would
fling
himself
upon
her
and
with
right
try
to
get
her
mouth
nose
eyes
within
his
own
tiny
mouth
he
would
seize
her
hair
within
his
little
fists
and
refuse
to
give
it
up
awaking
before
the
dawn
he
would
roll
over
to
her
side
and
thrill
her
with
his
soft
touch
and
babble
like
a
noisy
brook
later
on
he
would
call
her
and
and
in
hours
of
work
and
rest
by
doing
forbidden
things
eating
forbidden
food
going
to
forbidden
places
would
set
up
a
regular
tyranny
over
her
then
sasi
could
resist
no
longer
she
surrendered
herself
completely
to
this
wayward
little
tyrant
since
the
child
had
no
mother
his
influence
over
her
became
the
greater
ii
the
child
was
named
nilmani
when
he
was
two
years
old
his
father
fell
seriously
a
letter
reached
joygopal
asking
him
to
come
as
quickly
as
possible
when
after
much
trouble
he
got
leave
and
arrived
kaliprasanna
last
hour
had
come
before
he
died
kaliprasanna
entrusted
joygopal
with
the
charge
of
his
son
and
left
a
quarter
of
his
estate
to
his
daughter
so
joygopal
gave
up
his
appointment
and
came
home
to
look
after
his
property
after
a
long
time
husband
and
wife
met
again
when
a
material
body
breaks
it
may
be
put
together
again
but
when
two
human
beings
are
divided
after
a
long
separation
they
never
at
the
same
place
and
to
the
same
time
for
the
mind
is
a
living
thing
and
moment
by
moment
it
grows
and
changes
in
sasi
reunion
stirred
a
new
emotion
the
numbness
of
habit
in
their
old
marriage
was
entirely
removed
by
the
longing
born
of
separation
and
she
seemed
to
win
her
husband
much
more
closely
than
before
had
she
not
vowed
in
her
mind
that
whatever
days
might
come
and
how
long
soever
they
might
be
she
would
never
let
the
brightness
of
this
glowing
love
for
her
husband
be
dimmed
of
this
reunion
however
joygopal
felt
differently
when
they
were
constantly
together
before
he
had
been
bound
to
his
wife
by
his
interests
and
idiosyncrasies
his
wife
was
then
a
living
truth
in
his
life
and
there
would
have
been
a
great
rent
in
the
web
of
his
daily
habit
if
she
were
left
out
consequently
joygopal
found
himself
in
deep
waters
at
first
when
he
went
abroad
but
in
time
this
breach
in
habit
was
patched
up
by
a
new
habit
and
this
was
not
all
formerly
his
days
went
by
in
the
most
indolent
and
careless
fashion
for
the
last
two
years
the
stimulus
of
bettering
his
condition
had
stirred
so
powerfully
in
his
breast
that
he
had
nothing
else
in
his
thoughts
as
compared
with
the
intensity
of
this
new
passion
his
old
life
seemed
like
an
unsubstantial
shadow
the
greatest
changes
in
a
woman
nature
are
wrought
by
love
in
a
man
by
ambition
joygopal
when
he
returned
after
two
years
found
his
wife
not
quite
the
same
as
of
old
to
her
life
his
infant
had
added
a
new
breadth
this
part
of
her
life
was
wholly
unfamiliar
to
him
here
he
had
no
communion
with
his
wife
his
wife
tried
hard
to
share
her
love
for
the
child
with
him
but
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
succeeded
sasi
would
come
with
the
child
in
her
arms
and
hold
him
before
her
husband
with
a
smiling
face
nilmani
would
clasp
sasi
neck
and
hide
his
face
on
her
shoulder
and
admit
no
obligation
of
kindred
sasi
wished
that
her
little
brother
might
show
joygopal
all
the
arts
he
had
learnt
to
capture
a
man
mind
but
joygopal
was
not
very
keen
about
it
how
could
the
child
show
any
enthusiasm
joygopal
could
not
at
all
understand
what
there
was
in
the
dusky
child
that
so
much
love
should
be
wasted
on
him
women
quickly
understand
the
ways
of
love
sasi
at
once
understood
that
joygopal
did
not
care
for
nilmani
henceforth
she
used
to
screen
her
brother
with
the
greatest
care
to
keep
him
away
from
the
unloving
repelling
look
of
her
husband
thus
the
child
came
to
be
the
treasure
of
her
secret
care
the
object
of
her
isolated
love
joygopal
was
greatly
annoyed
when
nilmani
cried
so
sasi
would
quickly
press
the
child
to
her
breast
and
with
her
whole
heart
and
soul
try
to
soothe
him
and
when
nilmani
cry
happened
to
disturb
sleep
at
night
and
joygopal
with
an
expression
of
displeasure
and
in
a
tortured
spirit
growled
at
the
child
sasi
felt
humbled
and
fluttered
like
a
guilty
thing
then
she
would
take
up
the
child
in
her
lap
retire
to
a
distance
and
in
a
voice
of
pleading
love
with
such
endearments
as
gold
my
treasure
my
jewel
lull
him
to
sleep
children
will
fall
out
for
a
hundred
things
formerly
in
such
cases
sasi
would
punish
her
children
and
side
with
her
brother
for
he
was
motherless
now
the
law
changed
with
the
judge
nilmani
had
often
to
bear
heavy
punishment
without
fault
and
without
inquiry
this
wrong
went
like
a
dagger
to
sasi
heart
so
she
would
take
her
punished
brother
into
her
room
and
with
sweets
and
toys
and
by
caressing
and
kissing
him
solace
as
much
as
she
could
his
stricken
heart
thus
the
more
sasi
loved
nilmani
the
more
joygopal
was
annoyed
with
him
on
the
other
hand
the
more
joygopal
showed
his
contempt
for
nilmani
the
more
would
sasi
bathe
the
child
with
the
nectar
of
her
love
and
when
the
fellow
joygopal
behaved
harshly
to
his
wife
sasi
would
minister
to
him
silently
meekly
and
with
but
inwardly
they
hurt
each
other
moment
by
moment
about
nilmani
the
hidden
clash
of
a
silent
conflict
like
this
is
far
harder
to
bear
than
an
open
quarrel
iii
nilmani
head
was
the
largest
part
of
him
it
seemed
as
if
the
creator
had
blown
through
a
slender
stick
a
big
bubble
at
its
top
the
doctors
feared
sometimes
that
the
child
might
be
as
frail
and
as
quickly
evanescent
as
a
bubble
for
a
long
time
he
could
neither
speak
nor
walk
looking
at
his
sad
grave
face
you
might
think
that
his
parents
had
unburdened
all
the
sad
weight
of
their
advanced
years
upon
the
head
of
this
little
child
with
his
sister
care
and
nursing
nilmani
passed
the
period
of
danger
and
arrived
at
his
sixth
year
in
the
month
of
kartik
on
the
day
sasi
had
dressed
nilmani
up
as
a
little
babu
in
coat
and
and
and
was
giving
him
the
mark
when
her
outspoken
neighbour
tara
came
in
and
for
one
reason
or
another
began
a
quarrel
lit
the
mark
a
beautiful
and
touching
ceremony
in
which
a
hindu
sister
makes
a
mark
of
sandalwood
paste
on
the
forehead
of
her
brother
and
utters
a
formula
the
barrier
in
doorway
figurative
for
wishing
long
life
on
these
occasions
the
sisters
entertain
their
brothers
and
make
them
presents
of
clothes
etc
no
use
cried
she
the
brother
mark
with
so
much
show
and
ruining
the
brother
in
secret
at
this
sasi
was
thunderstruck
with
astonishment
rage
and
pain
tara
repeated
the
rumour
that
sasi
and
her
husband
had
conspired
together
to
put
the
minor
nilmani
property
up
for
sale
for
arrears
of
rent
and
to
purchase
it
in
the
name
of
her
husband
cousin
when
sasi
heard
this
she
uttered
a
curse
that
those
who
could
spread
such
a
foul
lie
might
be
stricken
with
leprosy
in
the
mouth
and
then
she
went
weeping
to
her
husband
and
told
him
of
the
gossip
joygopal
said
can
be
trusted
in
these
days
upen
is
my
aunt
son
and
i
felt
quite
safe
in
leaving
him
in
charge
of
the
property
he
could
not
have
allowed
the
hasilpur
to
fall
into
arrears
and
purchase
it
himself
in
secret
if
i
had
had
the
least
inkling
about
it
you
sue
then
asked
sasi
in
astonishment
one
cousin
said
joygopal
it
would
be
useless
a
simple
waste
of
money
it
was
sasi
supreme
duty
to
trust
her
husband
word
but
sasi
could
not
at
last
her
happy
home
the
domesticity
of
her
love
seemed
hateful
to
her
that
home
life
which
had
once
seemed
her
supreme
refuge
was
nothing
more
than
a
cruel
snare
of
which
had
surrounded
them
brother
and
sister
on
all
sides
she
was
a
woman
and
she
knew
not
how
she
could
save
the
helpless
nilmani
the
more
she
thought
the
more
her
heart
filled
with
terror
loathing
and
an
infinite
love
for
her
imperilled
little
brother
she
thought
that
if
she
only
knew
how
she
would
appear
before
the
nay
write
to
the
maharani
herself
to
save
her
property
the
maharani
would
surely
not
allow
nilmani
of
hasilpur
with
an
income
of
seven
hundred
and
rupees
a
year
to
be
sold
the
viceroy
land
when
sasi
was
thus
thinking
of
bringing
her
husband
cousin
to
book
by
appealing
to
the
maharani
herself
nilmani
was
suddenly
seized
with
fever
and
convulsions
joygopal
called
in
the
village
doctor
when
sasi
asked
for
a
better
doctor
joygopal
said
matilal
is
a
bad
sort
sasi
fell
at
his
feet
and
charged
him
with
an
oath
on
her
own
head
whereupon
joygopal
said
i
shall
send
for
the
doctor
from
town
sasi
lay
with
nilmani
in
her
lap
nor
would
nilmani
let
her
out
of
his
sight
for
a
minute
he
clung
to
her
lest
by
some
pretence
she
should
escape
even
while
he
slept
he
would
not
loosen
his
hold
of
her
dress
thus
the
whole
day
passed
and
joygopal
came
after
nightfall
to
say
that
the
doctor
was
not
at
home
he
had
gone
to
see
a
patient
at
a
distance
he
added
that
he
himself
had
to
leave
that
very
day
on
account
of
a
lawsuit
and
that
he
had
told
matilal
who
would
regularly
call
to
see
the
patient
at
night
nilmani
wandered
in
his
sleep
as
soon
as
the
morning
dawned
sasi
without
the
least
scruple
took
a
boat
with
her
sick
brother
and
went
straight
to
the
doctor
house
the
doctor
was
at
home
he
had
not
left
the
town
he
quickly
found
lodgings
for
her
and
having
installed
her
under
the
care
of
an
elderly
widow
undertook
the
treatment
of
the
boy
the
next
day
joygopal
arrived
blazing
with
fury
he
ordered
his
wife
to
return
home
with
him
at
once
if
you
cut
me
to
pieces
i
wo
return
replied
his
wife
all
want
to
kill
my
nilmani
who
has
no
father
no
mother
none
other
than
me
but
i
will
save
him
you
remain
here
and
do
come
back
to
my
house
cried
joygopal
indignantly
sasi
at
length
fired
up
house
why
is
my
brother
right
we
see
said
joygopal
the
neighbours
made
a
great
stir
over
this
incident
you
want
to
quarrel
with
your
husband
said
tara
so
at
home
what
is
the
good
of
leaving
your
house
after
all
joygopal
is
your
husband
by
spending
all
the
money
she
had
with
her
and
selling
her
ornaments
sasi
saved
her
brother
from
the
jaws
of
death
then
she
heard
that
the
big
property
which
they
had
in
dwarigram
where
their
stood
the
income
of
which
was
more
than
rs
a
year
had
been
transferred
by
joygopal
into
his
own
name
with
the
help
of
the
jemindar
and
now
the
whole
property
belonged
to
them
not
to
her
brother
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
illness
nilmani
would
cry
plaintively
us
go
home
sister
his
heart
was
pining
for
his
nephews
and
nieces
his
companions
so
he
repeatedly
said
us
go
home
sister
to
that
old
house
of
ours
at
this
sasi
wept
where
was
their
home
but
it
was
no
good
crying
her
brother
had
no
one
else
besides
herself
in
the
world
sasi
thought
of
this
wiped
her
tears
and
entering
the
zenana
of
the
deputy
magistrate
tarini
babu
appealed
to
his
wife
the
deputy
magistrate
knew
joygopal
that
a
woman
should
forsake
her
home
and
engage
in
a
dispute
with
her
husband
regarding
matters
of
property
greatly
incensed
him
against
sasi
however
tarini
babu
kept
sasi
diverted
and
instantly
wrote
to
joygopal
joygopal
put
his
wife
and
into
a
boat
by
force
and
brought
them
home
husband
and
wife
after
a
second
separation
met
again
for
the
second
time
the
decree
of
prajapati
the
hindu
god
of
marriage
having
got
back
his
old
companions
after
a
long
absence
nilmani
was
perfectly
happy
seeing
his
unsuspecting
joy
sasi
felt
as
if
her
heart
would
break
iv
the
magistrate
was
touring
in
the
mofussil
during
the
cold
weather
and
pitched
his
tent
within
the
village
to
shoot
the
saheb
met
nilmani
on
the
village
the
other
boys
gave
him
a
wide
berth
varying
chanakya
couplet
a
little
and
adding
the
saheb
to
the
list
of
clawed
the
toothed
and
the
horned
beasts
but
nilmani
in
imperturbable
curiosity
serenely
gazed
at
the
saheb
the
saheb
was
amused
and
came
up
and
asked
in
bengali
read
at
the
the
boy
silently
nodded
do
you
read
asked
the
saheb
a
literary
word
for
books
the
colloquial
will
be
as
nilmani
did
not
understand
the
word
he
silently
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
magistrate
face
nilmani
told
his
sister
the
story
of
his
meeting
the
magistrate
with
great
enthusiasm
at
noon
joygopal
dressed
in
trousers
and
went
to
pay
his
salams
to
the
saheb
a
crowd
of
suitors
and
constables
stood
about
him
fearing
the
heat
the
saheb
had
seated
himself
at
a
outside
the
tent
in
the
open
shade
and
placing
joygopal
in
a
chair
questioned
him
about
the
state
of
the
village
having
taken
the
seat
of
honour
in
open
view
of
the
community
joygopal
swelled
inwardly
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
if
any
of
the
chakrabartis
or
nandis
came
and
saw
him
there
a
is
a
long
coat
turban
servants
at
this
moment
a
woman
closely
veiled
and
accompanied
by
nilmani
came
straight
up
to
the
magistrate
she
said
into
your
hands
i
resign
my
helpless
brother
save
him
the
saheb
seeing
the
solemn
boy
whose
acquaintance
he
had
already
made
and
thinking
that
the
woman
must
be
of
a
respectable
family
at
once
stood
up
and
said
enter
the
tent
the
woman
said
i
have
to
say
i
will
say
here
joygopal
writhed
and
turned
pale
the
curious
villagers
thought
it
capital
fun
and
pressed
closer
but
the
moment
the
saheb
lifted
his
cane
they
scampered
off
holding
her
brother
by
the
hand
sasi
narrated
the
history
of
the
orphan
from
the
beginning
as
joygopal
tried
to
interrupt
now
and
then
the
magistrate
thundered
with
a
flushed
face
and
with
the
tip
of
his
cane
motioned
to
joygopal
to
leave
the
chair
and
stand
up
joygopal
inwardly
raging
against
sasi
stood
speechless
nilmani
nestled
up
close
to
his
sister
and
listened
when
sasi
had
finished
her
story
the
magistrate
put
a
few
questions
to
joygopal
and
on
hearing
his
answers
kept
silence
for
a
long
while
and
then
addressed
sasi
thus
good
woman
though
this
matter
may
not
come
up
before
me
still
rest
assured
i
will
do
all
that
is
needful
about
it
you
can
return
home
with
your
brother
without
the
least
misgiving
sasi
said
so
long
as
he
does
not
get
back
his
own
home
i
dare
not
take
him
there
unless
you
keep
nilmani
with
you
none
else
will
be
able
to
save
him
what
would
you
do
queried
the
saheb
will
retire
to
my
husband
house
said
sasi
is
nothing
to
fear
for
me
the
saheb
smiled
a
little
and
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
agreed
to
take
charge
of
this
lean
dusty
grave
sedate
gentle
bengali
boy
whose
neck
was
ringed
with
amulets
when
sasi
was
about
to
take
her
leave
the
boy
clutched
her
dress
be
frightened
come
said
the
saheb
with
tears
streaming
behind
her
veil
sasi
said
go
my
brother
my
darling
brother
you
will
meet
your
sister
again
saying
this
she
embraced
him
and
stroked
his
head
and
back
and
releasing
her
dress
hastily
withdrew
and
just
then
the
saheb
put
his
left
arm
round
him
the
child
wailed
out
oh
my
sister
sasi
turned
round
at
once
and
with
outstretched
arm
made
a
sign
of
speechless
solace
and
with
a
bursting
heart
withdrew
again
in
that
old
house
husband
and
wife
met
the
decree
of
prajapati
but
this
union
did
not
last
long
for
soon
after
the
villagers
learnt
one
morning
that
sasi
had
died
of
cholera
in
the
night
and
had
been
instantly
cremated
none
uttered
a
word
about
it
only
neighbour
tara
would
sometimes
be
on
the
point
of
bursting
out
but
people
would
shut
up
her
mouth
saying
at
parting
sasi
gave
her
word
to
her
brother
they
would
meet
again
where
that
word
was
kept
none
can
tell
subha
when
the
girl
was
given
the
name
of
subhashini
who
could
have
guessed
that
she
would
prove
dumb
her
two
elder
sisters
were
sukeshini
and
suhasini
and
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
her
father
named
his
youngest
girl
subhashini
she
was
called
subha
for
short
sweetly
speaking
sweetly
smiling
her
two
elder
sisters
had
been
married
with
the
usual
cost
and
difficulty
and
now
the
youngest
daughter
lay
like
a
silent
weight
upon
the
heart
of
her
parents
all
the
world
seemed
to
think
that
because
she
did
not
speak
therefore
she
did
not
feel
it
discussed
her
future
and
its
own
anxiety
freely
in
her
presence
she
had
understood
from
her
earliest
childhood
that
god
had
sent
her
like
a
curse
to
her
father
house
so
she
withdrew
herself
from
ordinary
people
and
tried
to
live
apart
if
only
they
would
all
forget
her
she
felt
she
could
endure
it
but
who
can
forget
pain
night
and
day
her
parents
minds
were
aching
on
her
account
especially
her
mother
looked
upon
her
as
a
deformity
in
herself
to
a
mother
a
daughter
is
a
more
closely
intimate
part
of
herself
than
a
son
can
be
and
a
fault
in
her
is
a
source
of
personal
shame
banikantha
father
loved
her
rather
better
than
his
other
daughters
her
mother
regarded
her
with
aversion
as
a
stain
upon
her
own
body
if
subha
lacked
speech
she
did
not
lack
a
pair
of
large
dark
eyes
shaded
with
long
lashes
and
her
lips
trembled
like
a
leaf
in
response
to
any
thought
that
rose
in
her
mind
when
we
express
our
thought
in
words
the
medium
is
not
found
easily
there
must
be
a
process
of
translation
which
is
often
inexact
and
then
we
fall
into
error
but
black
eyes
need
no
translating
the
mind
itself
throws
a
shadow
upon
them
in
them
thought
opens
or
shuts
shines
forth
or
goes
out
in
darkness
hangs
steadfast
like
the
setting
moon
or
like
the
swift
and
restless
lightning
illumines
all
quarters
of
the
sky
they
who
from
birth
have
had
no
other
speech
than
the
trembling
of
their
lips
learn
a
language
of
the
eyes
endless
in
expression
deep
as
the
sea
clear
as
the
heavens
wherein
play
dawn
and
sunset
light
and
shadow
the
dumb
have
a
lonely
grandeur
like
nature
own
wherefore
the
other
children
almost
dreaded
subha
and
never
played
with
her
she
was
silent
and
companionless
as
noontide
the
hamlet
where
she
lived
was
chandipur
its
river
small
for
a
river
of
bengal
kept
to
its
narrow
bounds
like
a
daughter
of
the
middle
class
this
busy
streak
of
water
never
overflowed
its
banks
but
went
about
its
duties
as
though
it
were
a
member
of
every
family
in
the
villages
beside
it
on
either
side
were
houses
and
banks
shaded
with
trees
so
stepping
from
her
queenly
throne
the
became
a
garden
deity
of
each
home
and
forgetful
of
herself
performed
her
task
of
endless
benediction
with
swift
and
cheerful
foot
banikantha
house
looked
upon
the
stream
every
hut
and
stack
in
the
place
could
be
seen
by
the
passing
boatmen
i
know
not
if
amid
these
signs
of
worldly
wealth
any
one
noticed
the
little
girl
who
when
her
work
was
done
stole
away
to
the
waterside
and
sat
there
but
here
nature
fulfilled
her
want
of
speech
and
spoke
for
her
the
murmur
of
the
brook
the
voice
of
the
village
folk
the
songs
of
the
boatmen
the
crying
of
the
birds
and
rustle
of
trees
mingled
and
were
one
with
the
trembling
of
her
heart
they
became
one
vast
wave
of
sound
which
beat
upon
her
restless
soul
this
murmur
and
movement
of
nature
were
the
dumb
girl
language
that
speech
of
the
dark
eyes
which
the
long
lashes
shaded
was
the
language
of
the
world
about
her
from
the
trees
where
the
cicalas
chirped
to
the
quiet
stars
there
was
nothing
but
signs
and
gestures
weeping
and
sighing
and
in
the
deep
when
the
boatmen
and
fisherfolk
had
gone
to
their
dinner
when
the
villagers
slept
and
birds
were
still
when
the
were
idle
when
the
great
busy
world
paused
in
its
toil
and
became
suddenly
a
lonely
awful
giant
then
beneath
the
vast
impressive
heavens
there
were
only
dumb
nature
and
a
dumb
girl
sitting
very
silent
one
under
the
spreading
sunlight
the
other
where
a
small
tree
cast
its
shadow
but
subha
was
not
altogether
without
friends
in
the
stall
were
two
cows
sarbbashi
and
panguli
they
had
never
heard
their
names
from
her
lips
but
they
knew
her
footfall
though
she
had
no
words
she
murmured
lovingly
and
they
understood
her
gentle
murmuring
better
than
all
speech
when
she
fondled
them
or
scolded
or
coaxed
them
they
understood
her
better
than
men
could
do
subha
would
come
to
the
shed
and
throw
her
arms
round
sarbbashi
neck
she
would
rub
her
cheek
against
her
friend
and
panguli
would
turn
her
great
kind
eyes
and
lick
her
face
the
girl
paid
them
three
regular
visits
every
day
and
others
that
were
irregular
whenever
she
heard
any
words
that
hurt
her
she
would
come
to
these
dumb
friends
out
of
due
time
it
was
as
though
they
guessed
her
anguish
of
spirit
from
her
quiet
look
of
sadness
coming
close
to
her
they
would
rub
their
horns
softly
against
her
arms
and
in
dumb
puzzled
fashion
try
to
comfort
her
besides
these
two
there
were
goats
and
a
kitten
but
subha
had
not
the
same
equality
of
friendship
with
them
though
they
showed
the
same
attachment
every
time
it
got
a
chance
night
or
day
the
kitten
would
jump
into
her
lap
and
settle
down
to
slumber
and
show
its
appreciation
of
an
aid
to
sleep
as
subha
drew
her
soft
fingers
over
its
neck
and
back
subha
had
a
comrade
also
among
the
higher
animals
and
it
is
hard
to
say
what
were
the
girl
relations
with
him
for
he
could
speak
and
his
gift
of
speech
left
them
without
any
common
language
he
was
the
youngest
boy
of
the
gosains
pratap
by
name
an
idle
fellow
after
long
effort
his
parents
had
abandoned
the
hope
that
he
would
ever
make
his
living
now
losels
have
this
advantage
that
though
their
own
folk
disapprove
of
them
they
are
generally
popular
with
every
one
else
having
no
work
to
chain
them
they
become
public
property
just
as
every
town
needs
an
open
space
where
all
may
breathe
so
a
village
needs
two
or
three
gentlemen
of
leisure
who
can
give
time
to
all
so
that
if
we
are
lazy
and
want
a
companion
one
is
to
hand
pratap
chief
ambition
was
to
catch
fish
he
managed
to
waste
a
lot
of
time
this
way
and
might
be
seen
almost
any
afternoon
so
employed
it
was
thus
most
often
that
he
met
subha
whatever
he
was
about
he
liked
a
companion
and
when
one
is
catching
fish
a
silent
companion
is
best
of
all
pratap
respected
subha
for
her
taciturnity
and
as
every
one
called
her
subha
he
showed
his
affection
by
calling
her
su
subha
used
to
sit
beneath
a
tamarind
and
pratap
a
little
distance
off
would
cast
his
line
pratap
took
with
him
a
small
allowance
of
betel
and
subha
prepared
it
for
him
and
i
think
that
sitting
and
gazing
a
long
while
she
desired
ardently
to
bring
some
great
help
to
pratap
to
be
of
real
aid
to
prove
by
any
means
that
she
was
not
a
useless
burden
to
the
world
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
then
she
turned
to
the
creator
in
prayer
for
some
rare
power
that
by
an
astonishing
miracle
she
might
startle
pratap
into
exclaiming
i
never
dreamt
our
su
could
have
done
this
only
think
if
subha
had
been
a
water
nymph
she
might
have
risen
slowly
from
the
river
bringing
the
gem
of
a
snake
crown
to
the
then
pratap
leaving
his
paltry
fishing
might
dive
into
the
lower
world
and
see
there
on
a
golden
bed
in
a
palace
of
silver
whom
else
but
dumb
little
su
banikantha
child
yes
our
su
the
only
daughter
of
the
king
of
that
shining
city
of
jewels
but
that
might
not
be
it
was
impossible
not
that
anything
is
really
impossible
but
su
had
been
born
not
into
the
royal
house
of
patalpur
but
into
banikantha
family
and
she
knew
no
means
of
astonishing
the
gosains
boy
the
lower
world
gradually
she
grew
up
gradually
she
began
to
find
herself
a
new
inexpressible
consciousness
like
a
tide
from
the
central
places
of
the
sea
when
the
moon
is
full
swept
through
her
she
saw
herself
questioned
herself
but
no
answer
came
that
she
could
understand
once
upon
a
time
late
on
a
night
of
full
moon
she
slowly
opened
her
door
and
peeped
out
timidly
nature
herself
at
full
moon
like
lonely
subha
was
looking
down
on
the
sleeping
earth
her
strong
young
life
beat
within
her
joy
and
sadness
filled
her
being
to
its
brim
she
reached
the
limits
even
of
her
own
illimitable
loneliness
nay
passed
beyond
them
her
heart
was
heavy
and
she
could
not
speak
at
the
skirts
of
this
silent
troubled
mother
there
stood
a
silent
troubled
girl
the
thought
of
her
marriage
filled
her
parents
with
an
anxious
care
people
blamed
them
and
even
talked
of
making
them
outcasts
banikantha
was
well
off
they
had
twice
daily
and
consequently
he
did
not
lack
enemies
then
the
women
interfered
and
bani
went
away
for
a
few
days
presently
he
returned
and
said
must
go
to
calcutta
they
got
ready
to
go
to
this
strange
country
subha
heart
was
heavy
with
tears
like
a
dawn
with
a
vague
fear
that
had
been
gathering
for
days
she
dogged
her
father
and
mother
like
a
dumb
animal
with
her
large
eyes
wide
open
she
scanned
their
faces
as
though
she
wished
to
learn
something
but
not
a
word
did
they
vouchsafe
one
afternoon
in
the
midst
of
all
this
as
pratap
was
fishing
he
laughed
then
su
they
have
caught
your
bridegroom
and
you
are
going
to
be
married
mind
you
do
forget
me
altogether
then
he
turned
his
mind
again
to
his
fish
as
a
stricken
doe
looks
in
the
hunter
face
asking
in
silent
agony
have
i
done
to
you
so
subha
looked
at
pratap
that
day
she
sat
no
longer
beneath
her
tree
banikantha
having
finished
his
nap
was
smoking
in
his
bedroom
when
subha
dropped
down
at
his
feet
and
burst
out
weeping
as
she
gazed
towards
him
banikantha
tried
to
comfort
her
and
his
cheek
grew
wet
with
tears
it
was
settled
that
on
the
morrow
they
should
go
to
calcutta
subha
went
to
the
to
bid
farewell
to
her
childhood
comrades
she
fed
them
with
her
hand
she
clasped
their
necks
she
looked
into
their
faces
and
tears
fell
fast
from
the
eyes
which
spoke
for
her
that
night
was
the
tenth
of
the
moon
subha
left
her
room
and
flung
herself
down
on
her
grassy
couch
beside
her
dear
river
it
was
as
if
she
threw
her
arms
about
earth
her
strong
silent
mother
and
tried
to
say
not
let
me
leave
you
mother
put
your
arms
about
me
as
i
have
put
mine
about
you
and
hold
me
fast
one
day
in
a
house
in
calcutta
subha
mother
dressed
her
up
with
great
care
she
imprisoned
her
hair
knotting
it
up
in
laces
she
hung
her
about
with
ornaments
and
did
her
best
to
kill
her
natural
beauty
subha
eyes
filled
with
tears
her
mother
fearing
they
would
grow
swollen
with
weeping
scolded
her
harshly
but
the
tears
disregarded
the
scolding
the
bridegroom
came
with
a
friend
to
inspect
the
bride
her
parents
were
dizzy
with
anxiety
and
fear
when
they
saw
the
god
arrive
to
select
the
beast
for
his
sacrifice
behind
the
stage
the
mother
called
her
instructions
aloud
and
increased
her
daughter
weeping
twofold
before
she
sent
her
into
the
presence
the
great
man
after
scanning
her
a
long
time
observed
so
bad
he
took
special
note
of
her
tears
and
thought
she
must
have
a
tender
heart
he
put
it
to
her
credit
in
the
account
arguing
that
the
heart
which
was
distressed
at
leaving
her
parents
would
presently
prove
a
useful
possession
like
the
oyster
pearls
the
child
tears
only
increased
her
value
and
he
made
no
other
comment
the
almanac
was
consulted
and
the
marriage
took
place
on
an
auspicious
day
having
delivered
over
their
dumb
girl
into
another
hands
subha
parents
returned
home
thank
god
their
caste
in
this
and
their
safety
in
the
next
world
were
assured
the
bridegroom
work
lay
in
the
west
and
shortly
after
the
marriage
he
took
his
wife
thither
in
less
than
ten
days
every
one
knew
that
the
bride
was
dumb
at
least
if
any
one
did
not
it
was
not
her
fault
for
she
deceived
no
one
her
eyes
told
them
everything
though
no
one
understood
her
she
looked
on
every
hand
she
found
no
speech
she
missed
the
faces
familiar
from
birth
of
those
who
had
understood
a
dumb
girl
language
in
her
silent
heart
there
sounded
an
endless
voiceless
weeping
which
only
the
searcher
of
hearts
could
hear
using
both
eyes
and
ears
time
her
lord
made
another
careful
examination
using
his
ears
this
time
as
well
as
his
eyes
and
married
a
second
wife
who
could
speak
the
postmaster
the
postmaster
first
took
up
his
duties
in
the
village
of
ulapur
though
the
village
was
a
small
one
there
was
an
indigo
factory
near
by
and
the
proprietor
an
englishman
had
managed
to
get
a
post
office
established
our
postmaster
belonged
to
calcutta
he
felt
like
a
fish
out
of
water
in
this
remote
village
his
office
and
were
in
a
dark
thatched
shed
not
far
from
a
green
slimy
pond
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
a
dense
growth
the
men
employed
in
the
indigo
factory
had
no
leisure
moreover
they
were
hardly
desirable
companions
for
decent
folk
nor
is
a
calcutta
boy
an
adept
in
the
art
of
associating
with
others
among
strangers
he
appears
either
proud
or
ill
at
ease
at
any
rate
the
postmaster
had
but
little
company
nor
had
he
much
to
do
at
times
he
tried
his
hand
at
writing
a
verse
or
two
that
the
movement
of
the
leaves
and
the
clouds
of
the
sky
were
enough
to
fill
life
with
joy
such
were
the
sentiments
to
which
he
sought
to
give
expression
but
god
knows
that
the
poor
fellow
would
have
felt
it
as
the
gift
of
a
new
life
if
some
genie
of
the
had
in
one
night
swept
away
the
trees
leaves
and
all
and
replaced
them
with
a
macadamised
road
hiding
the
clouds
from
view
with
rows
of
tall
houses
the
postmaster
salary
was
small
he
had
to
cook
his
own
meals
which
he
used
to
share
with
ratan
an
orphan
girl
of
the
village
who
did
odd
jobs
for
him
when
in
the
evening
the
smoke
began
to
curl
up
from
the
village
and
the
cicalas
chirped
in
every
bush
when
the
faquirs
of
the
baül
sect
sang
their
shrill
songs
in
their
daily
when
any
poet
who
had
attempted
to
watch
the
movement
of
the
leaves
in
the
dense
bamboo
thickets
would
have
felt
a
ghostly
shiver
run
down
his
back
the
postmaster
would
light
his
little
lamp
and
call
out
smoky
fires
are
lit
in
the
to
drive
off
mosquitoes
ratan
would
sit
outside
waiting
for
this
call
and
instead
of
coming
in
at
once
would
reply
you
call
me
sir
are
you
doing
the
postmaster
would
ask
must
be
going
to
light
the
kitchen
fire
would
be
the
answer
and
the
postmaster
would
say
let
the
kitchen
fire
be
for
awhile
light
me
my
pipe
first
at
last
ratan
would
enter
with
cheeks
vigorously
blowing
into
a
flame
a
live
coal
to
light
the
tobacco
this
would
give
the
postmaster
an
opportunity
of
conversing
ratan
perhaps
he
would
begin
you
remember
anything
of
your
mother
that
was
a
fertile
subject
ratan
partly
remembered
and
partly
did
her
father
had
been
fonder
of
her
than
her
mother
him
she
recollected
more
vividly
he
used
to
come
home
in
the
evening
after
his
work
and
one
or
two
evenings
stood
out
more
clearly
than
others
like
pictures
in
her
memory
ratan
would
squat
on
the
floor
near
the
feet
as
memories
crowded
in
upon
her
she
called
to
mind
a
little
brother
that
she
had
and
how
on
some
bygone
cloudy
day
she
had
played
at
fishing
with
him
on
the
edge
of
the
pond
with
a
twig
for
a
such
little
incidents
would
drive
out
greater
events
from
her
mind
thus
as
they
talked
it
would
often
get
very
late
and
the
postmaster
would
feel
too
lazy
to
do
any
cooking
at
all
ratan
would
then
hastily
light
the
fire
and
toast
some
unleavened
bread
which
with
the
cold
remnants
of
the
morning
meal
was
enough
for
their
supper
on
some
evenings
seated
at
his
desk
in
the
corner
of
the
big
empty
shed
the
postmaster
too
would
call
up
memories
of
his
own
home
of
his
mother
and
his
sister
of
those
for
whom
in
his
exile
his
heart
was
sad
memories
which
were
always
haunting
him
but
which
he
could
not
talk
about
with
the
men
of
the
factory
though
he
found
himself
naturally
recalling
them
aloud
in
the
presence
of
the
simple
little
girl
and
so
it
came
about
that
the
girl
would
allude
to
his
people
as
mother
brother
and
sister
as
if
she
had
known
them
all
her
life
in
fact
she
had
a
complete
picture
of
each
one
of
them
painted
in
her
little
heart
family
servants
call
the
master
and
mistress
father
and
mother
and
the
children
elder
brothers
and
sisters
one
noon
during
a
break
in
the
rains
there
was
a
cool
soft
breeze
blowing
the
smell
of
the
damp
grass
and
leaves
in
the
hot
sun
felt
like
the
warm
breathing
of
the
tired
earth
on
one
body
a
persistent
bird
went
on
all
the
afternoon
repeating
the
burden
of
its
one
complaint
in
nature
audience
chamber
the
postmaster
had
nothing
to
do
the
shimmer
of
the
freshly
washed
leaves
and
the
remnants
of
the
retreating
were
sights
to
see
and
the
postmaster
was
watching
them
and
thinking
to
himself
if
only
some
kindred
soul
were
near
just
one
loving
human
being
whom
i
could
hold
near
my
heart
this
was
exactly
he
went
on
to
think
what
that
bird
was
trying
to
say
and
it
was
the
same
feeling
which
the
murmuring
leaves
were
striving
to
express
but
no
one
knows
or
would
believe
that
such
an
idea
might
also
take
possession
of
an
village
postmaster
in
the
deep
silent
interval
of
his
work
the
postmaster
sighed
and
called
out
ratan
was
then
sprawling
beneath
the
busily
engaged
in
eating
unripe
guavas
at
the
voice
of
her
master
she
ran
up
breathlessly
saying
you
calling
me
dada
was
thinking
said
the
postmaster
teaching
you
to
read
and
then
for
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
he
taught
her
the
alphabet
dada
elder
brother
thus
in
a
very
short
time
ratan
had
got
as
far
as
the
double
consonants
it
seemed
as
though
the
showers
of
the
season
would
never
end
canals
ditches
and
hollows
were
all
overflowing
with
water
day
and
night
the
patter
of
rain
was
heard
and
the
croaking
of
frogs
the
village
roads
became
impassable
and
marketing
had
to
be
done
in
punts
one
heavily
clouded
morning
the
postmaster
little
pupil
had
been
long
waiting
outside
the
door
for
her
call
but
not
hearing
it
as
usual
she
took
up
her
book
and
slowly
entered
the
room
she
found
her
master
stretched
out
on
his
pallet
and
thinking
he
was
resting
she
was
about
to
retire
on
when
she
suddenly
heard
her
name
she
turned
at
once
and
asked
you
sleeping
dada
the
postmaster
in
a
plaintive
voice
said
am
not
well
feel
my
head
is
it
very
hot
in
the
loneliness
of
his
exile
and
in
the
gloom
of
the
rains
his
ailing
body
needed
a
little
tender
nursing
he
longed
to
remember
the
touch
on
the
forehead
of
soft
hands
with
tinkling
bracelets
to
imagine
the
presence
of
loving
womanhood
the
nearness
of
mother
and
sister
and
the
exile
was
not
disappointed
ratan
ceased
to
be
a
little
girl
she
at
once
stepped
into
the
post
of
mother
called
in
the
village
doctor
gave
the
patient
his
pills
at
the
proper
intervals
sat
up
all
night
by
his
pillow
cooked
his
gruel
for
him
and
every
now
and
then
asked
you
feeling
a
little
better
dada
it
was
some
time
before
the
postmaster
with
weakened
body
was
able
to
leave
his
more
of
this
said
he
with
decision
must
get
a
transfer
he
at
once
wrote
off
to
calcutta
an
application
for
a
transfer
on
the
ground
of
the
unhealthiness
of
the
place
relieved
from
her
duties
as
nurse
ratan
again
took
up
her
old
place
outside
the
door
but
she
no
longer
heard
the
same
old
call
she
would
sometimes
peep
inside
furtively
to
find
the
postmaster
sitting
on
his
chair
or
stretched
on
his
pallet
and
staring
into
the
air
while
ratan
was
awaiting
her
call
the
postmaster
was
awaiting
a
reply
to
his
application
the
girl
read
her
old
lessons
over
and
over
again
her
great
fear
was
lest
when
the
call
came
she
might
be
found
wanting
in
the
double
consonants
at
last
after
a
week
the
call
did
come
one
evening
with
an
overflowing
heart
ratan
rushed
into
the
room
with
her
you
calling
me
dada
the
postmaster
said
am
going
away
ratan
are
you
going
dada
am
going
home
will
you
come
back
am
not
coming
back
ratan
asked
no
other
question
the
postmaster
of
his
own
accord
went
on
to
tell
her
that
his
application
for
a
transfer
had
been
rejected
so
he
had
resigned
his
post
and
was
going
home
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
another
word
the
lamp
went
on
dimly
burning
and
from
a
leak
in
one
corner
of
the
thatch
water
dripped
steadily
into
an
earthen
vessel
on
the
floor
beneath
it
after
a
while
ratan
rose
and
went
off
to
the
kitchen
to
prepare
the
meal
but
she
was
not
so
quick
about
it
as
on
other
days
many
new
things
to
think
of
had
entered
her
little
brain
when
the
postmaster
had
finished
his
supper
the
girl
suddenly
asked
him
will
you
take
me
to
your
home
the
postmaster
laughed
an
idea
said
he
but
he
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
explain
to
the
girl
wherein
lay
the
absurdity
that
whole
night
in
her
waking
and
in
her
dreams
the
laughing
reply
haunted
her
an
idea
on
getting
up
in
the
morning
the
postmaster
found
his
bath
ready
he
had
stuck
to
his
calcutta
habit
of
bathing
in
water
drawn
and
kept
in
pitchers
instead
of
taking
a
plunge
in
the
river
as
was
the
custom
of
the
village
for
some
reason
or
other
the
girl
could
not
ask
him
about
the
time
of
his
departure
so
she
had
fetched
the
water
from
the
river
long
before
sunrise
that
it
should
be
ready
as
early
as
he
might
want
it
after
the
bath
came
a
call
for
ratan
she
entered
noiselessly
and
looked
silently
into
her
master
face
for
orders
the
master
said
need
not
be
anxious
about
my
going
away
ratan
i
shall
tell
my
successor
to
look
after
you
these
words
were
kindly
meant
no
doubt
but
inscrutable
are
the
ways
of
a
woman
heart
ratan
had
borne
many
a
scolding
from
her
master
without
complaint
but
these
kind
words
she
could
not
bear
she
burst
out
weeping
and
said
no
you
need
not
tell
anybody
anything
at
all
about
me
i
want
to
stay
on
here
the
postmaster
was
dumbfounded
he
had
never
seen
ratan
like
this
before
the
new
incumbent
duly
arrived
and
the
postmaster
having
given
over
charge
prepared
to
depart
just
before
starting
he
called
ratan
and
said
is
something
for
you
i
hope
it
will
keep
you
for
some
little
time
he
brought
out
from
his
pocket
the
whole
of
his
month
salary
retaining
only
a
trifle
for
his
travelling
expenses
then
ratan
fell
at
his
feet
and
cried
dada
i
pray
you
give
me
anything
do
in
any
way
trouble
about
me
and
then
she
ran
away
out
of
sight
the
postmaster
heaved
a
sigh
took
up
his
carpet
bag
put
his
umbrella
over
his
shoulder
and
accompanied
by
a
man
carrying
his
tin
trunk
he
slowly
made
for
the
boat
when
he
got
in
and
the
boat
was
under
way
and
the
river
like
a
stream
of
tears
welling
up
from
the
earth
swirled
and
sobbed
at
her
bows
then
he
felt
a
sort
of
pain
at
heart
the
face
of
a
village
girl
seemed
to
represent
for
him
the
great
unspoken
pervading
grief
of
mother
earth
herself
at
one
time
he
had
an
impulse
to
go
back
and
bring
away
along
with
him
that
lonesome
waif
forsaken
of
the
world
but
the
wind
had
just
filled
the
sails
the
boat
had
got
well
into
the
middle
of
the
turbulent
current
and
already
the
village
was
left
behind
and
its
outlying
came
in
sight
so
the
traveller
borne
on
the
breast
of
the
river
consoled
himself
with
philosophical
reflections
on
the
numberless
meetings
and
partings
going
on
in
the
world
on
death
the
great
parting
from
which
none
returns
but
ratan
had
no
philosophy
she
was
wandering
about
the
post
office
in
a
flood
of
tears
it
may
be
that
she
had
still
a
lurking
hope
in
some
corner
of
her
heart
that
her
dada
would
return
and
that
is
why
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
alas
for
the
foolish
human
heart
the
river
stairs
if
you
wish
to
hear
of
days
gone
by
sit
on
this
step
of
mine
and
lend
your
ears
to
the
murmur
of
the
rippling
water
the
month
of
september
was
about
to
begin
the
river
was
in
full
flood
only
four
of
my
steps
peeped
above
the
surface
the
water
had
crept
up
to
the
parts
of
the
bank
where
the
plant
grew
dense
beneath
the
branches
of
the
mango
grove
at
that
bend
of
the
river
three
old
towered
above
the
water
around
them
the
moored
to
the
trunks
of
the
trees
on
the
bank
rocked
on
the
heaving
at
dawn
the
path
of
tall
grasses
on
the
sandbank
had
caught
the
newly
risen
sun
they
had
just
begun
to
flower
and
were
not
yet
in
full
bloom
the
little
boats
puffed
out
their
tiny
sails
on
the
sunlit
river
the
brahmin
priest
had
come
to
bathe
with
his
ritual
vessels
the
women
arrived
in
twos
and
threes
to
draw
water
i
knew
this
was
the
time
of
kusum
coming
to
the
but
that
morning
i
missed
her
bhuban
and
swarno
mourned
at
the
they
said
that
their
friend
had
been
led
away
to
her
husband
house
which
was
a
place
far
away
from
the
river
with
strange
people
strange
houses
and
strange
roads
in
time
she
almost
faded
out
of
my
mind
a
year
passed
the
women
at
the
now
rarely
talked
of
kusum
but
one
evening
i
was
startled
by
the
touch
of
the
long
familiar
feet
ah
yes
but
those
feet
were
now
without
anklets
they
had
lost
their
old
music
kusum
had
become
a
widow
they
said
that
her
husband
had
worked
in
some
place
and
that
she
had
met
him
only
once
or
twice
a
letter
brought
her
the
news
of
his
death
a
widow
at
eight
years
old
she
had
rubbed
out
the
wife
red
mark
from
her
forehead
stripped
off
her
bangles
and
come
back
to
her
old
home
by
the
ganges
but
she
found
few
of
her
old
playmates
there
of
them
bhuban
swarno
and
amala
were
married
and
gone
away
only
sarat
remained
and
she
too
they
said
would
be
wed
in
december
next
as
the
ganges
rapidly
grows
to
fulness
with
the
coming
of
the
rains
even
so
did
kusum
day
by
day
grow
to
the
fulness
of
beauty
and
youth
but
her
robe
her
pensive
face
and
quiet
manners
drew
a
veil
over
her
youth
and
hid
it
from
men
eyes
as
in
a
mist
ten
years
slipped
away
and
none
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
kusum
had
grown
up
one
morning
such
as
this
at
the
end
of
a
september
a
tall
young
sanyasi
coming
i
know
not
whence
took
shelter
in
the
shiva
temple
in
front
of
me
his
arrival
was
noised
abroad
in
the
village
the
women
left
their
pitchers
behind
and
crowded
into
the
temple
to
bow
to
the
holy
man
the
crowd
increased
day
by
day
the
sanyasi
fame
rapidly
spread
among
the
womenkind
one
day
he
would
recite
the
another
day
he
would
expound
the
or
hold
forth
upon
a
holy
book
in
the
temple
some
sought
him
for
counsel
some
for
spells
some
for
medicines
so
months
passed
away
in
april
at
the
time
of
the
solar
eclipse
vast
crowds
came
here
to
bathe
in
the
ganges
a
fair
was
held
under
the
tree
many
of
the
pilgrims
went
to
visit
the
sanyasi
and
among
them
were
a
party
of
women
from
the
village
where
kusum
had
been
married
it
was
morning
the
sanyasi
was
counting
his
beads
on
my
steps
when
all
of
a
sudden
one
of
the
women
pilgrims
nudged
another
and
said
he
is
our
kusum
husband
another
parted
her
veil
a
little
in
the
middle
with
two
fingers
and
cried
out
dear
me
so
it
is
he
is
the
younger
son
of
the
chattergu
family
of
our
village
said
a
third
who
made
little
parade
of
her
veil
he
has
got
exactly
the
same
brow
nose
and
eyes
yet
another
woman
without
turning
to
the
sanyasi
stirred
the
water
with
her
pitcher
and
sighed
that
young
man
is
no
more
he
will
not
come
back
bad
luck
to
kusum
but
objected
one
had
not
such
a
big
beard
and
another
was
not
so
thin
or
was
most
probably
not
so
tall
that
settled
the
question
for
the
time
and
the
matter
spread
no
further
one
evening
as
the
full
moon
arose
kusum
came
and
sat
upon
my
last
step
above
the
water
and
cast
her
shadow
upon
me
there
was
no
other
at
the
just
then
the
crickets
were
chirping
about
me
the
din
of
brass
gongs
and
bells
had
ceased
in
the
temple
the
last
wave
of
sound
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
it
merged
like
the
shade
of
a
sound
in
the
dim
groves
of
the
farther
bank
on
the
dark
water
of
the
ganges
lay
a
line
of
glistening
moonlight
on
the
bank
above
in
bush
and
hedge
under
the
porch
of
the
temple
in
the
base
of
ruined
houses
by
the
side
of
the
tank
in
the
palm
grove
gathered
shadows
of
fantastic
shape
the
bats
swung
from
the
boughs
near
the
houses
the
loud
clamour
of
the
jackals
rose
and
sank
into
silence
slowly
the
sanyasi
came
out
of
the
temple
descending
a
few
steps
of
the
he
saw
a
woman
sitting
alone
and
was
about
to
go
back
when
suddenly
kusum
raised
her
head
and
looked
behind
her
the
veil
slipped
away
from
her
the
moonlight
fell
upon
her
face
as
she
looked
up
the
owl
flew
away
hooting
over
their
heads
starting
at
the
sound
kusum
came
to
herself
and
put
the
veil
back
on
her
head
then
she
bowed
low
at
the
sanyasi
feet
he
gave
her
blessing
and
asked
are
you
she
replied
am
called
kusum
no
other
word
was
spoken
that
night
kusum
went
slowly
back
to
her
house
which
was
hard
by
but
the
sanyasi
remained
sitting
on
my
steps
for
long
hours
that
night
at
last
when
the
moon
passed
from
the
east
to
the
west
and
the
sanyasi
shadow
shifting
from
behind
fell
in
front
of
him
he
rose
up
and
entered
the
temple
henceforth
i
saw
kusum
come
daily
to
bow
at
his
feet
when
he
expounded
the
holy
books
she
stood
in
a
corner
listening
to
him
after
finishing
his
morning
service
he
used
to
call
her
to
himself
and
speak
on
religion
she
could
not
have
understood
it
all
but
listening
attentively
in
silence
she
tried
to
understand
it
as
he
directed
her
so
she
acted
implicitly
she
daily
served
at
the
temple
ever
alert
in
the
god
worship
gathering
flowers
for
the
and
drawing
water
from
the
ganges
to
wash
the
temple
floor
the
winter
was
drawing
to
its
close
we
had
cold
winds
but
now
and
then
in
the
evening
the
warm
spring
breeze
would
blow
unexpectedly
from
the
south
the
sky
would
lose
its
chilly
aspect
pipes
would
sound
and
music
be
heard
in
the
village
after
a
long
silence
the
boatmen
would
set
their
boats
drifting
down
the
current
stop
rowing
and
begin
to
sing
the
songs
of
krishna
this
was
the
season
just
then
i
began
to
miss
kusum
for
some
time
she
had
given
up
visiting
the
temple
the
or
the
sanyasi
what
happened
next
i
do
not
know
but
after
a
while
the
two
met
together
on
my
steps
one
evening
with
downcast
looks
kusum
asked
did
you
send
for
me
why
do
i
not
see
you
why
have
you
grown
neglectful
of
late
in
serving
the
gods
she
kept
silent
me
your
thoughts
without
reserve
half
averting
her
face
she
replied
am
a
sinner
master
and
hence
i
have
failed
in
the
worship
the
sanyasi
said
i
know
there
is
unrest
in
your
heart
she
gave
a
slight
start
and
drawing
the
end
of
her
sári
over
her
face
she
sat
down
on
the
step
at
the
sanyasi
feet
and
wept
he
moved
a
little
away
and
said
me
what
you
have
in
your
heart
and
i
shall
show
you
the
way
to
peace
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
unshaken
faith
stopping
now
and
then
for
words
you
bid
me
i
must
speak
out
but
then
i
can
not
explain
it
clearly
you
master
must
have
guessed
it
all
i
adored
one
as
a
god
i
worshipped
him
and
the
bliss
of
that
devotion
filled
my
heart
to
fulness
but
one
night
i
dreamt
that
the
lord
of
my
heart
was
sitting
in
a
garden
somewhere
clasping
my
right
hand
in
his
left
and
whispering
to
me
of
love
the
whole
scene
did
not
appear
to
me
at
all
strange
the
dream
vanished
but
its
hold
on
me
remained
next
day
when
i
beheld
him
he
appeared
in
another
light
than
before
that
continued
to
haunt
my
mind
i
fled
far
from
him
in
fear
and
the
picture
clung
to
me
thenceforth
my
heart
has
known
no
peace
all
has
grown
dark
within
me
while
she
was
wiping
her
tears
and
telling
this
tale
i
felt
that
the
sanyasi
was
firmly
pressing
my
stone
surface
with
his
right
foot
her
speech
done
the
sanyasi
said
must
tell
me
whom
you
saw
in
your
dream
with
folded
hands
she
entreated
can
not
he
insisted
must
tell
me
who
he
was
wringing
her
hands
she
asked
i
tell
it
he
replied
you
must
then
crying
are
he
master
she
fell
on
her
face
on
my
stony
bosom
and
sobbed
when
she
came
to
herself
and
sat
up
the
sanyasi
said
slowly
am
leaving
this
place
that
you
may
not
see
me
again
know
that
i
am
a
sanyasi
not
belonging
to
this
world
must
forget
me
kusum
replied
in
a
low
voice
will
be
so
master
the
sanyasi
said
take
my
leave
without
a
word
more
kusum
bowed
to
him
and
placed
the
dust
of
his
feet
on
her
head
he
left
the
place
the
moon
set
the
night
grew
dark
i
heard
a
splash
in
the
water
the
wind
raved
in
the
darkness
as
if
it
wanted
to
blow
out
all
the
stars
of
the
sky
the
castaway
towards
evening
the
storm
was
at
its
height
from
the
terrific
downpour
of
rain
the
crash
of
thunder
and
the
repeated
flashes
of
lightning
you
might
think
that
a
battle
of
the
gods
and
demons
was
raging
in
the
skies
black
clouds
waved
like
the
flags
of
doom
the
ganges
was
lashed
into
a
fury
and
the
trees
of
the
gardens
on
either
bank
swayed
from
side
to
side
with
sighs
and
groans
in
a
closed
room
of
one
of
the
riverside
houses
at
chandernagore
a
husband
and
his
wife
were
seated
on
a
bed
spread
on
the
floor
intently
discussing
an
earthen
lamp
burned
beside
them
the
husband
sharat
was
saying
wish
you
would
stay
on
a
few
days
more
you
would
then
be
able
to
return
home
quite
strong
again
the
wife
kiran
was
saying
have
quite
recovered
already
it
will
not
can
not
possibly
do
me
any
harm
to
go
home
now
every
married
person
will
at
once
understand
that
the
conversation
was
not
quite
so
brief
as
i
have
reported
it
the
matter
was
not
difficult
but
the
arguments
for
and
against
did
not
advance
it
towards
a
solution
like
a
rudderless
boat
the
discussion
kept
turning
round
and
round
the
same
point
and
at
last
it
threatened
to
be
overwhelmed
in
a
flood
of
tears
sharat
said
doctor
thinks
you
should
stop
here
a
few
days
longer
kiran
replied
doctor
knows
everything
said
sharat
know
that
just
now
all
sorts
of
illness
are
abroad
you
would
do
well
to
stop
here
a
month
or
two
more
at
this
moment
i
suppose
every
one
in
this
place
is
perfectly
well
what
had
happened
was
this
kiran
was
a
universal
favourite
with
her
family
and
neighbours
so
that
when
she
fell
seriously
ill
they
were
all
anxious
the
village
wiseacres
thought
it
shameless
for
her
husband
to
make
so
much
fuss
about
a
mere
wife
and
even
to
suggest
a
change
of
air
and
asked
if
sharat
supposed
that
no
woman
had
ever
been
ill
before
or
whether
he
had
found
out
that
the
folk
of
the
place
to
which
he
meant
to
take
her
were
immortal
did
he
imagine
that
the
writ
of
fate
did
not
run
there
but
sharat
and
his
mother
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
them
thinking
that
the
little
life
of
their
darling
was
of
greater
importance
than
the
united
wisdom
of
a
village
people
are
wont
to
reason
thus
when
danger
threatens
their
loved
ones
so
sharat
went
to
chandernagore
and
kiran
recovered
though
she
was
still
very
weak
there
was
a
pinched
look
on
her
face
which
filled
the
beholder
with
pity
and
made
his
heart
tremble
as
he
thought
how
narrowly
she
had
escaped
death
kiran
was
fond
of
society
and
amusement
the
loneliness
of
her
riverside
villa
did
not
suit
her
at
all
there
was
nothing
to
do
there
were
no
interesting
neighbours
and
she
hated
to
be
busy
all
day
with
medicine
and
dieting
there
was
no
fun
in
measuring
doses
and
making
fomentations
such
was
the
subject
discussed
in
their
closed
room
on
this
stormy
evening
so
long
as
kiran
deigned
to
argue
there
was
a
chance
of
a
fair
fight
when
she
ceased
to
reply
and
with
a
toss
of
her
head
disconsolately
looked
the
other
way
the
poor
man
was
disarmed
he
was
on
the
point
of
surrendering
unconditionally
when
a
servant
shouted
a
message
through
the
shut
door
sharat
got
up
and
opening
the
door
learnt
that
a
boat
had
been
upset
in
the
storm
and
that
one
of
the
occupants
a
young
brahmin
boy
had
succeeded
in
swimming
ashore
in
their
garden
kiran
was
at
once
her
own
sweet
self
and
set
to
work
to
get
out
some
dry
clothes
for
the
boy
she
then
warmed
a
cup
of
milk
and
invited
him
to
her
room
the
boy
had
long
curly
hair
big
expressive
eyes
and
no
sign
yet
of
hair
on
the
face
kiran
after
getting
him
to
drink
some
milk
asked
him
all
about
himself
he
told
her
that
his
name
was
nilkanta
and
that
he
belonged
to
a
theatrical
troupe
they
were
coming
to
play
in
a
neighbouring
villa
when
the
boat
had
suddenly
foundered
in
the
storm
he
had
no
idea
what
had
become
of
his
companions
he
was
a
good
swimmer
and
had
just
managed
to
reach
the
shore
the
boy
stayed
with
them
his
narrow
escape
from
a
terrible
death
made
kiran
take
a
warm
interest
in
him
sharat
thought
the
appearance
at
this
moment
rather
a
good
thing
as
his
wife
would
now
have
something
to
amuse
her
and
might
be
persuaded
to
stay
on
for
some
time
longer
her
too
was
pleased
at
the
prospect
of
profiting
their
brahmin
guest
by
her
kindness
and
nilkanta
himself
was
delighted
at
his
double
escape
from
his
master
and
from
the
other
world
as
well
as
at
finding
a
home
in
this
wealthy
family
but
in
a
short
while
sharat
and
his
mother
changed
their
opinion
and
longed
for
his
departure
the
boy
found
a
secret
pleasure
in
smoking
sharat
hookas
he
would
calmly
go
off
in
pouring
rain
with
best
silk
umbrella
for
a
stroll
through
the
village
and
make
friends
with
all
whom
he
met
moreover
he
had
got
hold
of
a
mongrel
village
dog
which
he
petted
so
recklessly
that
it
came
indoors
with
muddy
paws
and
left
tokens
of
its
visit
on
sharat
spotless
bed
then
he
gathered
about
him
a
devoted
band
of
boys
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
and
the
result
was
that
not
a
solitary
mango
in
the
neighbourhood
had
a
chance
of
ripening
that
season
there
is
no
doubt
that
kiran
had
a
hand
in
spoiling
the
boy
sharat
often
warned
her
about
it
but
she
would
not
listen
to
him
she
made
a
dandy
of
him
with
sharat
clothes
and
gave
him
new
ones
too
and
because
she
felt
drawn
towards
him
and
also
had
a
curiosity
to
know
more
about
him
she
was
constantly
calling
him
to
her
own
room
after
her
bath
and
meal
kiran
would
be
seated
on
the
bedstead
with
her
box
by
her
side
and
while
her
maid
combed
and
dried
her
hair
nilkanta
would
stand
in
front
and
recite
pieces
out
of
his
repertory
with
appropriate
gesture
and
song
his
waving
wildly
thus
the
long
afternoon
hours
passed
merrily
away
kiran
would
often
try
to
persuade
sharat
to
sit
with
her
as
one
of
the
audience
but
sharat
who
had
taken
a
cordial
dislike
to
the
boy
refused
nor
could
nilkanta
do
his
part
half
so
well
when
sharat
was
there
his
mother
would
sometimes
be
lured
by
the
hope
of
hearing
sacred
names
in
the
recitation
but
love
of
her
sleep
speedily
overcame
devotion
and
she
lay
lapped
in
dreams
the
boy
often
got
his
ears
boxed
and
pulled
by
sharat
but
as
this
was
nothing
to
what
he
had
been
used
to
as
a
member
of
the
troupe
he
did
not
mind
it
in
the
least
in
his
short
experience
of
the
world
he
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
as
the
earth
consisted
of
land
and
water
so
human
life
was
made
up
of
eatings
and
beatings
and
that
the
beatings
largely
predominated
it
was
hard
to
tell
nilkanta
age
if
it
was
about
fourteen
or
fifteen
then
his
face
was
too
old
for
his
years
if
seventeen
or
eighteen
then
it
was
too
young
he
was
either
a
man
too
early
or
a
boy
too
late
the
fact
was
that
joining
the
theatrical
band
when
very
young
he
had
played
the
parts
of
radhika
damaynti
sita
and
bidya
companion
a
thoughtful
providence
so
arranged
things
that
he
grew
to
the
exact
stature
that
his
manager
required
and
then
growth
ceased
since
every
one
saw
how
small
he
was
and
he
himself
felt
small
he
did
not
receive
due
respect
for
his
years
these
causes
natural
and
artificial
combined
to
make
him
sometimes
seem
immature
for
seventeen
years
and
at
other
times
a
lad
of
fourteen
but
far
too
knowing
for
seventeen
and
as
no
sign
of
hair
appeared
on
his
face
the
confusion
became
greater
either
because
he
smoked
or
because
he
used
language
beyond
his
years
his
lips
puckered
into
lines
that
showed
him
to
be
old
and
hard
but
innocence
and
youth
shone
in
his
large
eyes
i
fancy
that
his
heart
remained
young
but
the
hot
glare
of
publicity
had
been
a
that
ripened
untimely
his
outward
aspect
in
the
quiet
shelter
of
sharat
house
and
garden
at
chandernagore
nature
had
leisure
to
work
her
way
unimpeded
he
had
lingered
in
a
kind
of
unnatural
youth
but
now
he
silently
and
swiftly
overpassed
that
stage
his
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
came
to
adequate
revelation
no
one
observed
the
change
and
its
first
sign
was
this
that
when
kiran
treated
him
like
a
boy
he
felt
ashamed
when
the
gay
kiran
one
day
proposed
that
he
should
play
the
part
of
lady
companion
the
idea
of
woman
dress
hurt
him
though
he
could
not
say
why
so
now
when
she
called
for
him
to
act
over
again
his
old
characters
he
disappeared
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
even
now
not
much
more
than
a
in
a
strolling
company
he
even
made
up
his
mind
to
pick
up
a
little
education
from
sharat
factor
but
because
nilkanta
was
the
pet
of
his
master
wife
the
factor
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
him
also
his
restless
training
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
keep
his
mind
long
engaged
presently
the
alphabet
did
a
misty
dance
before
his
eyes
he
would
sit
long
enough
with
an
open
book
on
his
lap
leaning
against
a
bush
beside
the
ganges
the
waves
sighed
below
boats
floated
past
birds
flitted
and
twittered
restlessly
above
what
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
as
he
looked
down
on
that
book
he
alone
knew
if
indeed
he
did
know
he
never
advanced
from
one
word
to
another
but
the
glorious
thought
that
he
was
actually
reading
a
book
filled
his
soul
with
exultation
whenever
a
boat
went
by
he
lifted
his
book
and
pretended
to
be
reading
hard
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
but
his
energy
dropped
as
soon
as
the
audience
was
gone
formerly
he
sang
his
songs
automatically
but
now
their
tunes
stirred
in
his
mind
their
words
were
of
little
import
and
full
of
trifling
alliteration
even
the
little
meaning
they
had
was
beyond
his
comprehension
yet
when
he
sang
bird
ah
wherefore
stirred
to
wrong
our
royal
lady
goose
ah
say
why
wilt
thou
slay
her
in
forest
shady
then
he
felt
as
if
transported
to
another
world
and
to
far
other
folk
this
familiar
earth
and
his
own
poor
life
became
music
and
he
was
transformed
that
tale
of
goose
and
king
daughter
flung
upon
the
mirror
of
his
mind
a
picture
of
surpassing
beauty
it
is
impossible
to
say
what
he
imagined
he
himself
was
but
the
destitute
little
slave
of
the
theatrical
troupe
faded
from
his
memory
once
in
the
egg
and
again
once
out
of
the
egg
see
note
on
damaynti
when
with
evening
the
child
of
want
lies
down
dirty
and
hungry
in
his
squalid
home
and
hears
of
prince
and
princess
and
fabled
gold
then
in
the
dark
hovel
with
its
dim
flickering
candle
his
mind
springs
free
from
her
bonds
of
poverty
and
misery
and
walks
in
fresh
beauty
and
glowing
raiment
strong
beyond
all
fear
of
hindrance
through
that
fairy
realm
where
all
is
possible
even
so
this
drudge
of
wandering
players
fashioned
himself
and
his
world
anew
as
he
moved
in
spirit
amid
his
songs
the
lapping
water
rustling
leaves
and
calling
birds
the
goddess
who
had
given
shelter
to
him
the
helpless
the
godforsaken
her
gracious
lovely
face
her
exquisite
arms
with
their
shining
bangles
her
rosy
feet
as
soft
as
all
these
by
some
magic
became
one
with
the
music
of
his
song
when
the
singing
ended
the
mirage
faded
and
nilkanta
of
the
stage
appeared
again
with
his
wild
fresh
from
the
complaints
of
his
neighbour
the
owner
of
the
despoiled
sharat
would
come
and
box
his
ears
and
cuff
him
the
boy
nilkanta
the
misleader
of
adoring
youths
went
forth
once
more
to
make
ever
new
mischief
by
land
and
water
and
in
the
branches
that
are
above
the
earth
shortly
after
the
advent
of
nilkanta
sharat
younger
brother
satish
came
to
spend
his
college
vacation
with
them
kiran
was
hugely
pleased
at
finding
a
fresh
occupation
she
and
satish
were
of
the
same
age
and
the
time
passed
pleasantly
in
games
and
quarrels
and
and
laughter
and
even
tears
suddenly
she
would
clasp
him
over
the
eyes
from
behind
with
hands
she
would
write
on
his
back
and
sometimes
bolt
the
door
on
him
from
outside
amidst
peals
of
laughter
satish
in
his
turn
did
not
take
things
lying
down
he
would
take
her
keys
and
rings
he
would
put
pepper
among
her
betel
he
would
tie
her
to
the
bed
when
she
was
not
looking
meanwhile
heaven
only
knows
what
possessed
poor
nilkanta
he
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
bitterness
which
he
must
avenge
on
somebody
or
something
he
thrashed
his
devoted
for
no
fault
and
sent
them
away
crying
he
would
kick
his
pet
mongrel
till
it
made
the
skies
resound
with
its
whinings
when
he
went
out
for
a
walk
he
would
litter
his
path
with
twigs
and
leaves
beaten
from
the
roadside
shrubs
with
his
cane
kiran
liked
to
see
people
enjoying
good
fare
nilkanta
had
an
immense
capacity
for
eating
and
never
refused
a
good
thing
however
often
it
was
offered
so
kiran
liked
to
send
for
him
to
have
his
meals
in
her
presence
and
ply
him
with
delicacies
happy
in
the
bliss
of
seeing
this
brahmin
boy
eat
to
satiety
after
satish
arrival
she
had
much
less
spare
time
on
her
hands
and
was
seldom
present
when
nilkanta
meals
were
served
before
her
absence
made
no
difference
to
the
boy
appetite
and
he
would
not
rise
till
he
had
drained
his
cup
of
milk
and
rinsed
it
thoroughly
with
water
a
habit
which
was
relic
from
his
days
of
poverty
when
milk
was
too
rare
a
luxury
to
allow
of
even
its
stains
in
the
cup
being
wasted
but
now
if
kiran
was
not
present
to
ask
him
to
try
this
and
that
he
was
miserable
and
nothing
tasted
right
he
would
get
up
without
eating
much
and
say
to
the
in
a
choking
voice
am
not
hungry
he
thought
in
imagination
that
the
news
of
his
repeated
refusal
am
not
hungry
would
reach
kiran
he
pictured
her
concern
and
hoped
that
she
would
send
for
him
and
press
him
to
eat
but
nothing
of
the
sort
happened
kiran
never
knew
and
never
sent
for
him
and
the
maid
finished
whatever
he
left
he
would
then
put
out
the
lamp
in
his
room
and
throw
himself
on
his
bed
in
the
darkness
burying
his
head
in
the
pillow
in
a
paroxysm
of
sobs
what
was
his
grievance
against
whom
and
from
whom
did
he
expect
redress
at
last
when
none
else
came
mother
sleep
soothed
with
her
soft
caresses
the
wounded
heart
of
the
motherless
lad
nilkanta
came
to
the
unshakable
conviction
that
satish
was
poisoning
kiran
mind
against
him
if
kiran
was
and
had
not
her
usual
smile
he
would
jump
to
the
conclusion
that
some
trick
of
satish
had
made
her
angry
with
him
he
took
to
praying
to
the
gods
with
all
the
fervour
of
his
hate
to
make
him
at
the
next
rebirth
satish
and
satish
him
he
had
an
idea
that
a
brahmin
wrath
could
never
be
in
vain
and
the
more
he
tried
to
consume
satish
with
the
fire
of
his
curses
the
more
did
his
own
heart
burn
within
him
and
upstairs
he
would
hear
satish
laughing
and
joking
with
his
nilkanta
never
dared
openly
to
show
his
enmity
to
satish
but
he
would
contrive
a
hundred
petty
ways
of
causing
him
annoyance
when
satish
went
for
a
swim
in
the
river
and
left
his
soap
on
the
steps
of
the
on
coming
back
for
it
he
would
find
that
it
had
disappeared
once
he
found
his
favourite
striped
tunic
floating
past
him
on
the
water
and
thought
it
had
been
blown
away
by
the
wind
one
day
kiran
desiring
to
entertain
satish
sent
for
nilkanta
to
recite
as
usual
but
he
stood
there
in
gloomy
silence
quite
surprised
kiran
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
but
he
remained
silent
and
when
again
pressed
by
her
to
repeat
some
particular
favourite
piece
of
hers
he
answered
do
remember
and
walked
away
at
last
the
time
came
for
their
return
home
everybody
was
busy
packing
up
satish
was
going
with
them
but
to
nilkanta
nobody
said
a
word
the
question
whether
he
was
to
go
or
not
seemed
not
to
have
occurred
to
anybody
the
question
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
been
raised
by
kiran
who
had
proposed
to
take
him
along
with
them
but
her
husband
and
his
mother
and
brother
had
all
objected
so
strenuously
that
she
let
the
matter
drop
a
couple
of
days
before
they
were
to
start
she
sent
for
the
boy
and
with
kind
words
advised
him
to
go
back
to
his
own
home
so
many
days
had
he
felt
neglected
that
this
touch
of
kindness
was
too
much
for
him
he
burst
into
tears
kiran
eyes
were
also
brimming
over
she
was
filled
with
remorse
at
the
thought
that
she
had
created
a
tie
of
affection
which
could
not
be
permanent
but
satish
was
much
annoyed
at
the
blubbering
of
this
overgrown
boy
does
the
fool
stand
there
howling
instead
of
speaking
said
he
when
kiran
scolded
him
for
an
unfeeling
creature
he
replied
mine
you
do
not
understand
you
are
too
good
and
trustful
this
fellow
turns
up
from
the
lord
knows
where
and
is
treated
like
a
king
naturally
the
tiger
has
no
wish
to
become
a
mouse
again
and
he
has
evidently
discovered
that
there
is
nothing
like
a
tear
or
two
to
soften
your
heart
a
reference
to
a
of
a
saint
who
turned
a
pet
mouse
into
a
tiger
nilkanta
hurriedly
left
the
spot
he
felt
he
would
like
to
be
a
knife
to
cut
satish
to
pieces
a
needle
to
pierce
him
through
and
through
a
fire
to
burn
him
to
ashes
but
satish
was
not
even
scarred
it
was
only
his
own
heart
that
bled
and
bled
satish
had
brought
with
him
from
calcutta
a
grand
inkstand
the
inkpot
was
set
in
a
boat
drawn
by
a
goose
supporting
a
penholder
it
was
a
great
favourite
of
his
and
he
cleaned
it
carefully
every
day
with
an
old
silk
handkerchief
kiran
would
laugh
and
tapping
the
silver
bird
beak
would
say
bird
ah
wherefore
stirred
to
wrong
our
royal
lady
and
the
usual
war
of
words
would
break
out
between
her
and
her
the
day
before
they
were
to
start
the
inkstand
was
missing
and
could
nowhere
be
found
kiran
smiled
and
said
your
goose
has
flown
off
to
look
for
your
damaynti
to
find
satish
a
wife
but
satish
was
in
a
great
rage
he
was
certain
that
nilkanta
had
stolen
it
for
several
people
said
they
had
seen
him
prowling
about
the
room
the
night
before
he
had
the
accused
brought
before
him
kiran
also
was
there
have
stolen
my
inkstand
you
thief
he
blurted
out
it
back
at
once
nilkanta
had
always
taken
punishment
from
sharat
deserved
or
undeserved
with
perfect
equanimity
but
when
he
was
called
a
thief
in
kiran
presence
his
eyes
blazed
with
a
fierce
anger
his
breast
swelled
and
his
throat
choked
if
satish
had
said
another
word
he
would
have
flown
at
him
like
a
wild
cat
and
used
his
nails
like
claws
kiran
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
scene
and
taking
the
boy
into
another
room
said
in
her
sweet
kind
way
if
you
really
have
taken
that
inkstand
give
it
to
me
quietly
and
i
shall
see
that
no
one
says
another
word
to
you
about
it
big
tears
coursed
down
the
boy
cheeks
till
at
last
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
wept
bitterly
kiran
came
back
from
the
room
and
said
am
sure
nilkanta
has
not
taken
the
inkstand
sharat
and
satish
were
equally
positive
that
no
other
than
nilkanta
could
have
done
it
but
kiran
said
determinedly
sharat
wanted
to
the
boy
but
his
wife
refused
to
allow
it
then
satish
suggested
that
his
room
and
box
should
be
searched
and
kiran
said
you
dare
do
such
a
thing
i
will
never
never
forgive
you
you
shall
not
spy
on
the
poor
innocent
boy
and
as
she
spoke
her
wonderful
eyes
filled
with
tears
that
settled
the
matter
and
effectually
prevented
any
further
molestation
of
nilkanta
kiran
heart
overflowed
with
pity
at
this
attempted
outrage
on
a
homeless
lad
she
got
two
new
suits
of
clothes
and
a
pair
of
shoes
and
with
these
and
a
banknote
in
her
hand
she
quietly
went
into
room
in
the
evening
she
intended
to
put
these
parting
presents
into
his
box
as
a
surprise
the
box
itself
had
been
her
gift
from
her
bunch
of
keys
she
selected
one
that
fitted
and
noiselessly
opened
the
box
it
was
so
jumbled
up
with
odds
and
ends
that
the
new
clothes
would
not
go
in
so
she
thought
she
had
better
take
everything
out
and
pack
the
box
for
him
at
first
knives
tops
reels
bamboo
twigs
polished
shells
for
peeling
green
mangoes
bottoms
of
broken
tumblers
and
such
like
things
dear
to
a
boy
heart
were
discovered
then
there
came
a
layer
of
linen
clean
and
otherwise
and
from
under
the
linen
there
emerged
the
missing
inkstand
goose
and
all
kiran
with
flushed
face
sat
down
helplessly
with
the
inkstand
in
her
hand
puzzled
and
wondering
in
the
meantime
nilkanta
had
come
into
the
room
from
behind
without
kiran
knowing
it
he
had
seen
the
whole
thing
and
thought
that
kiran
had
come
like
a
thief
to
catch
him
in
his
thieving
and
that
his
deed
was
out
how
could
he
ever
hope
to
convince
her
that
he
was
not
a
thief
and
that
only
revenge
had
prompted
him
to
take
the
inkstand
which
he
meant
to
throw
into
the
river
at
the
first
chance
in
a
weak
moment
he
had
put
it
in
his
box
instead
was
not
a
thief
his
heart
cried
out
a
thief
then
what
was
he
what
could
he
say
he
had
stolen
and
yet
he
was
not
a
thief
he
could
never
explain
to
kiran
how
grievously
wrong
she
was
in
taking
him
for
a
thief
how
could
he
bear
the
thought
that
she
had
tried
to
spy
on
him
at
last
kiran
with
a
deep
sigh
replaced
the
inkstand
in
the
box
and
as
if
she
were
the
thief
herself
covered
it
up
with
the
linen
and
the
trinkets
as
they
were
before
and
at
the
top
she
placed
the
presents
together
with
the
banknote
which
she
had
brought
for
him
the
next
day
the
boy
was
nowhere
to
be
found
the
villagers
had
not
seen
him
the
police
could
discover
no
trace
of
him
said
sharat
as
a
matter
of
curiosity
let
us
have
a
look
at
his
box
but
kiran
was
obstinate
in
her
refusal
to
allow
that
to
be
done
she
had
the
box
brought
up
to
her
own
room
and
taking
out
the
inkstand
alone
threw
it
into
the
river
the
whole
family
went
home
in
a
day
the
garden
became
desolate
and
only
that
starving
mongrel
of
nilkanta
remained
prowling
along
the
whining
and
whining
as
if
its
heart
would
break
saved
gouri
was
the
beautiful
delicately
nurtured
child
of
an
old
and
wealthy
family
her
husband
paresh
had
recently
by
his
own
efforts
improved
his
straitened
circumstances
so
long
as
he
was
poor
parents
had
kept
their
daughter
at
home
unwilling
to
surrender
her
to
privation
so
she
was
no
longer
young
when
at
last
she
went
to
her
husband
house
and
paresh
never
felt
quite
that
she
belonged
to
him
he
was
an
advocate
in
a
small
western
town
and
had
no
close
kinsman
with
him
all
his
thought
was
about
his
wife
so
much
so
that
sometimes
he
would
come
home
before
the
rising
of
the
court
at
first
gouri
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
why
he
came
back
suddenly
sometimes
too
he
would
dismiss
one
of
the
servants
without
reason
none
of
them
ever
suited
him
long
especially
if
gouri
desired
to
keep
any
particular
servant
because
he
was
useful
that
man
was
sure
to
be
got
rid
of
forthwith
the
gouri
greatly
resented
this
but
her
resentment
only
made
her
husband
behaviour
still
stranger
at
last
when
paresh
unable
to
contain
himself
any
longer
began
in
secret
to
the
maid
about
her
the
whole
thing
reached
his
wife
ears
she
was
a
woman
of
few
words
but
her
pride
raged
within
like
a
wounded
lioness
at
these
insults
and
this
mad
suspicion
swept
like
a
destroyer
sword
between
them
paresh
as
soon
as
he
saw
that
his
wife
understood
his
motive
felt
no
more
delicacy
about
taxing
gouri
to
her
face
and
the
more
his
wife
treated
it
with
silent
contempt
the
more
did
the
fire
of
his
jealousy
consume
him
deprived
of
wedded
happiness
the
childless
gouri
betook
herself
to
the
consolations
of
religion
she
sent
for
paramananda
swami
the
young
preacher
of
the
hard
by
and
formally
acknowledging
him
as
her
spiritual
preceptor
asked
him
to
expound
the
to
her
all
the
wasted
love
and
affection
of
her
woman
heart
was
poured
out
in
reverence
at
the
feet
of
her
guru
no
one
had
any
doubts
about
the
purity
of
paramananda
character
all
worshipped
him
and
because
paresh
did
not
dare
to
hint
at
any
suspicion
against
him
his
jealousy
ate
its
way
into
his
heart
like
a
hidden
cancer
one
day
some
trifling
circumstance
made
the
poison
overflow
paresh
reviled
paramananda
to
his
wife
as
a
hypocrite
and
said
you
swear
that
you
are
not
in
love
with
this
crane
that
plays
the
ascetic
gouri
sprang
up
like
a
snake
that
has
been
trodden
on
and
maddened
by
his
suspicion
said
with
bitter
irony
what
if
i
am
at
this
paresh
forthwith
went
off
to
the
and
locked
the
door
on
her
in
a
white
heat
of
passion
at
this
last
outrage
gouri
got
the
door
open
somehow
and
left
the
house
paramananda
was
poring
over
the
scriptures
in
his
lonely
room
in
the
silence
of
noon
all
at
once
like
a
flash
of
lightning
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
gouri
broke
in
upon
his
reading
here
questioned
her
guru
in
surprise
me
o
my
lord
guru
said
she
the
insults
of
my
home
life
and
allow
me
to
dedicate
myself
to
the
service
of
your
feet
with
a
stern
rebuke
paramananda
sent
gouri
back
home
but
i
wonder
whether
he
ever
again
took
up
the
snapped
thread
of
his
reading
paresh
finding
the
door
open
on
his
return
home
asked
has
been
here
one
his
wife
replied
have
been
to
the
house
of
my
guru
asked
paresh
pale
and
red
by
turns
i
wanted
to
from
that
day
paresh
had
a
guard
kept
over
the
house
and
behaved
so
absurdly
that
the
tale
of
his
jealousy
was
told
all
over
the
town
the
news
of
the
shameful
insults
that
were
daily
heaped
on
his
disciple
disturbed
the
religious
meditations
of
paramananda
he
felt
he
ought
to
leave
the
place
at
once
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
forsake
the
tortured
woman
who
can
say
how
the
poor
ascetic
got
through
those
terrible
days
and
nights
at
last
one
day
the
imprisoned
gouri
got
a
letter
child
it
ran
is
true
that
many
holy
women
have
left
the
world
to
devote
themselves
to
god
should
it
happen
that
the
trials
of
this
world
are
driving
your
thoughts
away
from
god
i
will
with
god
help
rescue
his
handmaid
for
the
holy
service
of
his
feet
if
you
desire
you
may
meet
me
by
the
tank
in
your
garden
at
two
afternoon
gouri
hid
the
letter
in
the
loops
of
her
hair
at
noon
next
day
when
she
was
undoing
her
hair
before
her
bath
she
found
that
the
letter
was
not
there
could
it
have
fallen
on
to
the
bed
and
got
into
her
husband
hands
she
wondered
at
first
she
felt
a
kind
of
fierce
pleasure
in
thinking
that
it
would
enrage
him
and
then
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
this
letter
worn
as
a
halo
of
deliverance
on
her
head
might
be
defiled
by
the
touch
of
insolent
hands
with
swift
steps
she
hurried
to
her
husband
room
he
lay
groaning
on
the
floor
with
eyes
rolled
back
and
foaming
mouth
she
detached
the
letter
from
his
clenched
fist
and
sent
quickly
for
a
doctor
the
doctor
said
it
was
a
case
of
apoplexy
the
patient
had
died
before
his
arrival
that
very
day
as
it
happened
paresh
had
an
important
appointment
away
from
home
paramananda
had
found
this
out
and
accordingly
had
made
his
appointment
with
gouri
to
such
a
depth
had
he
fallen
when
the
widowed
gouri
caught
sight
from
the
window
of
her
guru
stealing
like
a
thief
to
the
side
of
the
pool
she
lowered
her
eyes
as
at
a
lightning
flash
and
in
that
flash
she
saw
clearly
what
a
fall
his
had
been
the
guru
called
am
coming
she
replied
when
paresh
friends
heard
of
his
death
and
came
to
assist
in
the
last
rites
they
found
the
dead
body
of
gouri
lying
beside
that
of
her
husband
she
had
poisoned
herself
all
were
lost
in
admiration
of
the
wifely
loyalty
she
had
shown
in
her
a
loyalty
rare
indeed
in
these
degenerate
days
my
fair
neighbour
my
feelings
towards
the
young
widow
who
lived
in
the
next
house
to
mine
were
feelings
of
worship
at
least
that
is
what
i
told
to
my
friends
and
myself
even
my
nearest
intimate
nabin
knew
nothing
of
the
real
state
of
my
mind
and
i
had
a
sort
of
pride
that
i
could
keep
my
passion
pure
by
thus
concealing
it
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
my
heart
she
was
like
a
untimely
fallen
to
earth
too
radiant
and
holy
for
the
she
had
been
dedicated
to
heaven
but
passion
is
like
the
mountain
stream
and
refuses
to
be
enclosed
in
the
place
of
its
birth
it
must
seek
an
outlet
that
is
why
i
tried
to
give
expression
to
my
emotions
in
poems
but
my
unwilling
pen
refused
to
desecrate
the
object
of
my
worship
it
happened
curiously
that
just
at
this
time
my
friend
nabin
was
afflicted
with
a
madness
of
verse
it
came
upon
him
like
an
earthquake
it
was
the
poor
fellow
first
attack
and
he
was
equally
unprepared
for
rhyme
and
rhythm
nevertheless
he
could
not
refrain
for
he
succumbed
to
the
fascination
as
a
widower
to
his
second
wife
so
nabin
sought
help
from
me
the
subject
of
his
poems
was
the
old
old
one
which
is
ever
new
his
poems
were
all
addressed
to
the
beloved
one
i
slapped
his
back
in
jest
and
asked
him
old
chap
who
is
she
nabin
laughed
as
he
replied
i
have
not
yet
discovered
i
confess
that
i
found
considerable
comfort
in
bringing
help
to
my
friend
like
a
hen
brooding
on
a
duck
egg
i
lavished
all
the
warmth
of
my
passion
on
nabin
effusions
so
vigorously
did
i
revise
and
improve
his
crude
productions
that
the
larger
part
of
each
poem
became
my
own
then
nabin
would
say
in
surprise
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
say
but
could
not
how
on
earth
do
you
manage
to
get
hold
of
all
these
fine
sentiments
i
would
reply
come
from
my
imagination
for
as
you
know
truth
is
silent
and
it
is
imagination
only
which
waxes
eloquent
reality
represses
the
flow
of
feeling
like
a
rock
imagination
cuts
out
a
path
for
itself
and
the
poor
puzzled
nabin
would
say
i
see
yes
of
course
and
then
after
some
thought
would
murmur
again
yes
you
are
right
as
i
have
already
said
in
my
own
love
there
was
a
feeling
of
reverential
delicacy
which
prevented
me
from
putting
it
into
words
but
with
nabin
as
a
screen
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
the
flow
of
my
pen
and
a
true
warmth
of
feeling
gushed
out
into
these
vicarious
poems
nabin
in
his
lucid
moments
would
say
these
are
yours
let
me
publish
them
over
your
name
i
would
reply
are
yours
my
dear
fellow
i
have
only
added
a
touch
or
two
here
and
there
and
nabin
gradually
came
to
believe
it
i
will
not
deny
that
with
a
feeling
akin
to
that
of
the
astronomer
gazing
into
the
starry
heavens
i
did
sometimes
turn
my
eyes
towards
the
window
of
the
house
next
door
it
is
also
true
that
now
and
again
my
furtive
glances
would
be
rewarded
with
a
vision
and
the
least
glimpse
of
the
pure
light
of
that
countenance
would
at
once
still
and
clarify
all
that
was
turbulent
and
unworthy
in
my
emotions
but
one
day
i
was
startled
could
i
believe
my
eyes
it
was
a
hot
summer
afternoon
one
of
the
fierce
and
fitful
was
threatening
black
clouds
were
massed
in
the
corner
of
the
sky
and
against
the
strange
and
fearful
light
of
that
background
my
fair
neighbour
stood
gazing
out
into
empty
space
and
what
a
world
of
forlorn
longing
did
i
discover
in
the
look
of
those
lustrous
black
eyes
was
there
then
perchance
still
some
living
volcano
within
the
serene
radiance
of
that
moon
of
mine
alas
that
look
of
limitless
yearning
which
was
winging
its
way
through
the
clouds
like
an
eager
bird
surely
sought
not
heaven
but
the
nest
of
some
human
heart
at
the
sight
of
the
unutterable
passion
of
that
look
i
could
hardly
contain
myself
i
was
no
longer
satisfied
with
correcting
crude
poems
my
whole
being
longed
to
express
itself
in
some
worthy
action
at
last
i
thought
i
would
devote
myself
to
making
popular
in
my
country
i
was
prepared
not
only
to
speak
and
write
on
the
subject
but
also
to
spend
money
on
its
cause
nabin
began
to
argue
with
me
widowhood
said
he
in
it
a
sense
of
immense
purity
and
peace
a
calm
beauty
like
that
of
the
silent
places
of
the
dead
shimmering
in
the
wan
light
of
the
eleventh
moon
would
not
the
mere
possibility
of
remarriage
destroy
its
divine
beauty
the
eleventh
day
of
the
moon
is
a
day
of
fasting
and
penance
now
this
sort
of
sentimentality
always
makes
me
furious
in
time
of
famine
if
a
man
speaks
scornfully
of
food
and
advises
a
starving
man
at
point
of
death
to
glut
his
hunger
on
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
the
song
of
birds
what
are
we
to
think
of
him
i
said
with
some
heat
here
nabin
to
the
artist
a
ruin
may
be
a
beautiful
object
but
houses
are
built
not
only
for
the
contemplation
of
artists
but
that
people
may
live
therein
so
they
have
to
be
kept
in
repair
in
spite
of
artistic
susceptibilities
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
idealise
widowhood
from
your
safe
distance
but
you
should
remember
that
within
widowhood
there
is
a
sensitive
human
heart
throbbing
with
pain
and
desire
i
had
an
impression
that
the
conversion
of
nabin
would
be
a
difficult
matter
so
perhaps
i
was
more
impassioned
than
i
need
have
been
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
find
at
the
conclusion
of
my
little
speech
that
nabin
after
a
single
thoughtful
sigh
completely
agreed
with
me
the
even
more
convincing
peroration
which
i
felt
i
might
have
delivered
was
not
needed
after
about
a
week
nabin
came
to
me
and
said
that
if
i
would
help
him
he
was
prepared
to
lead
the
way
by
marrying
a
widow
himself
i
was
overjoyed
i
embraced
him
effusively
and
promised
him
any
money
that
might
be
required
for
the
purpose
then
nabin
told
me
his
story
i
learned
that
nabin
loved
one
was
not
an
imaginary
being
it
appeared
that
nabin
too
had
for
some
time
adored
a
widow
from
a
distance
but
had
not
spoken
of
his
feelings
to
any
living
soul
then
the
magazines
in
which
nabin
poems
or
rather
poems
used
to
appear
had
reached
the
fair
one
hands
and
the
poems
had
not
been
ineffective
not
that
nabin
had
deliberately
intended
as
he
was
careful
to
explain
to
conduct
in
that
way
in
fact
said
he
he
had
no
idea
that
the
widow
knew
how
to
read
he
used
to
post
the
magazine
without
disclosing
the
sender
name
addressed
to
the
brother
it
was
only
a
sort
of
fancy
of
his
a
concession
to
his
hopeless
passion
it
was
flinging
garlands
before
a
deity
it
is
not
the
worshipper
affair
whether
the
god
knows
or
not
whether
he
accepts
or
ignores
the
offering
and
nabin
particularly
wanted
me
to
understand
that
he
had
no
definite
end
in
view
when
on
diverse
pretexts
he
sought
and
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
widow
brother
any
near
relation
of
the
loved
one
needs
must
have
a
special
interest
for
the
lover
then
followed
a
long
story
about
how
an
illness
of
the
brother
at
last
brought
them
together
the
presence
of
the
poet
himself
naturally
led
to
much
discussion
of
the
poems
nor
was
the
discussion
necessarily
restricted
to
the
subject
out
of
which
it
arose
after
his
recent
defeat
in
argument
at
my
hands
nabin
had
mustered
up
courage
to
propose
marriage
to
the
widow
at
first
he
could
not
gain
her
consent
but
when
he
had
made
full
use
of
my
eloquent
words
supplemented
by
a
tear
or
two
of
his
own
the
fair
one
capitulated
unconditionally
some
money
was
now
wanted
by
her
guardian
to
make
arrangements
it
at
once
said
i
nabin
went
on
know
it
will
be
some
months
before
i
can
appease
my
father
sufficiently
for
him
to
continue
my
allowance
how
are
we
to
live
in
the
meantime
i
wrote
out
the
necessary
cheque
without
a
word
and
then
i
said
tell
me
who
she
is
you
need
not
look
on
me
as
a
possible
rival
for
i
swear
i
will
not
write
poems
to
her
and
even
if
i
do
i
will
not
send
them
to
her
brother
but
to
you
be
absurd
said
nabin
have
not
kept
back
her
name
because
i
feared
your
rivalry
the
fact
is
she
was
very
much
perturbed
at
taking
this
unusual
step
and
had
asked
me
not
to
talk
about
the
matter
to
my
friends
but
it
no
longer
matters
now
that
everything
has
been
satisfactorily
settled
she
lives
at
no
the
house
next
to
yours
if
my
heart
had
been
an
iron
boiler
it
would
have
burst
she
has
no
objection
to
remarriage
i
simply
asked
at
the
present
moment
replied
nabin
with
a
smile
was
it
the
poems
alone
which
wrought
the
magic
change
my
poems
were
not
so
bad
you
know
said
nabin
they
i
swore
mentally
but
at
whom
was
i
to
swear
at
him
at
myself
at
providence
all
the
same
i
swore
the
end
