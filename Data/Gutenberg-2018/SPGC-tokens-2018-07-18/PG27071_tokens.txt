preface
miss
mayor
story
is
of
a
delicate
quality
not
common
here
though
occurring
at
intervals
and
always
sure
of
a
choice
if
not
very
large
audience
among
those
who
like
in
art
the
refined
movement
and
the
gentle
line
her
subject
like
her
method
is
one
not
commonly
chosen
by
women
writers
it
is
simply
the
life
of
an
unmarried
idle
woman
of
the
last
generation
a
life
to
some
eyes
of
wasted
leisure
and
deep
futility
but
common
enough
and
getting
from
its
permitted
commonness
a
justification
from
life
who
is
wasteful
but
roughly
just
miss
mayor
tells
this
story
with
singular
skill
more
by
contrast
than
by
drama
bringing
her
chief
character
into
relief
against
her
world
as
it
passes
in
swift
procession
her
tale
is
in
a
form
becoming
common
among
our
best
writers
it
is
compressed
into
a
space
about
a
third
as
long
as
the
ordinary
novel
yet
form
and
manner
are
so
closely
suited
that
all
is
told
and
nothing
seems
slightly
done
or
worked
with
too
rapid
a
hand
much
that
is
tiresome
in
the
modern
novel
the
pages
of
analysis
and
of
comment
the
long
descriptions
and
the
nervous
pathology
are
omitted
by
miss
mayor
method
which
is
all
for
the
swift
movement
and
against
the
temptations
to
delay
which
obstruct
those
whose
eyes
are
not
upon
life
she
condenses
her
opportunities
for
psychology
and
platitude
into
a
couple
of
shrewd
lines
and
goes
on
with
her
story
keeping
her
freshness
and
the
reader
interest
unabated
the
method
is
to
draw
the
central
figure
rapidly
past
a
succession
of
bright
lights
keeping
the
lights
various
and
of
many
colours
and
allowing
none
of
them
to
shine
too
long
this
comparatively
passive
creative
method
suits
the
subject
for
her
heroine
has
the
fate
to
be
born
in
a
land
where
myriads
of
women
of
her
station
go
passively
like
poultry
along
all
the
tramways
of
their
parishes
life
is
something
that
happens
to
them
it
is
their
duty
to
keep
to
the
tracks
and
having
enough
to
eat
and
enough
to
put
on
therewith
to
be
content
or
if
not
content
sour
but
in
any
case
to
seek
no
further
over
the
parochial
bounds
her
heroine
born
into
such
a
tradition
continues
in
it
partly
by
the
pressure
of
custom
and
family
habit
both
always
very
powerful
and
often
deadly
in
this
country
and
partly
from
a
want
of
illumination
in
herself
her
instructors
and
in
the
life
about
her
the
latter
want
is
the
fatal
defect
in
her
it
is
the
national
defect
the
everlasting
prison
remediless
into
which
so
many
thousands
of
our
idle
are
yearly
thrown
it
is
from
this
that
she
really
suffers
it
is
to
this
that
she
succumbs
while
the
ivy
of
her
disposition
grows
over
and
smothers
whatever
light
may
be
in
her
like
water
in
revolving
muddily
over
the
choked
outlet
her
life
revolves
over
the
evil
in
it
without
resolution
or
escape
her
brain
like
so
many
of
the
brains
in
civilization
is
but
slightly
drawn
upon
or
exercised
she
is
not
so
much
wasted
as
not
used
having
by
fortune
and
tradition
nothing
to
do
she
remains
passive
till
events
and
time
make
her
incapable
of
doing
while
the
world
glitters
past
in
its
various
activity
throwing
her
incapacity
into
ever
stronger
relief
till
her
time
is
over
and
the
general
muddle
is
given
a
kind
of
sacredness
even
of
beauty
by
ceasing
she
has
done
nothing
but
live
and
been
nothing
but
alive
both
to
such
passive
purpose
that
the
ceasing
is
pitiful
and
it
is
by
pushing
on
to
this
end
instead
of
shirking
it
and
by
marking
the
last
tragical
fact
which
puts
a
dignity
upon
even
the
meanest
being
that
miss
mayor
raises
her
story
above
the
plane
of
social
criticism
and
keeps
it
sincere
a
lesser
writer
would
have
been
content
with
less
and
having
imagined
her
central
figure
would
have
continued
to
stick
pins
into
it
till
the
result
would
have
been
no
living
figure
but
a
record
of
personal
judgments
perhaps
even
as
sometimes
happens
of
personal
pettiness
a
witch
waxen
figure
plentifully
pricked
before
the
consuming
flame
miss
mayor
keeps
on
the
side
of
justice
with
the
real
creators
to
whom
there
is
nothing
simple
and
no
one
unmixed
and
in
this
way
gets
beauty
and
through
beauty
the
only
reality
worth
having
in
a
land
like
england
where
there
is
great
wealth
little
education
and
little
general
thought
people
like
miss
mayor
heroine
are
common
we
have
all
met
not
one
or
two
but
dozens
of
her
we
know
her
emptiness
her
tenacity
her
futility
savagery
and
want
of
light
all
circles
contain
some
examples
of
her
all
people
some
of
her
shortcomings
and
judgment
of
her
even
the
isolation
of
her
in
portraiture
is
dangerous
since
the
world
does
not
consist
of
her
and
life
needs
her
in
life
as
in
art
those
who
condemn
are
those
who
do
not
understand
and
it
is
always
a
sign
of
a
writer
power
that
he
or
she
keeps
from
direct
praise
or
blame
of
imagined
character
miss
mayor
arrives
at
an
understanding
of
her
heroine
character
by
looking
at
her
through
a
multitude
of
different
eyes
not
as
though
she
were
her
creator
but
as
if
she
were
her
world
looking
on
and
happening
infinitely
active
and
various
coming
into
infinite
contrast
not
without
tragedy
but
also
never
without
fun
the
world
is
of
course
the
comparatively
passive
feminine
world
but
few
modern
books
if
any
have
treated
of
that
world
so
happily
with
such
complete
acceptance
unbiassed
and
unprejudiced
yet
with
such
selective
tact
and
variety
of
gaiety
she
comes
to
the
complete
understanding
of
henrietta
by
illuminating
all
the
facets
in
her
character
and
all
the
threads
of
her
destiny
and
this
is
an
unusual
achievement
made
all
the
more
remarkable
by
a
brightness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
give
delightful
life
to
a
multitude
of
incidents
which
are
in
themselves
new
to
fiction
her
touch
upon
all
her
world
is
both
swift
and
unerring
but
the
great
charm
of
her
work
is
its
brightness
and
unexpectedness
it
lights
up
so
many
little
unsuspected
corners
in
a
world
that
is
too
plentifully
curtained
john
masefield
the
third
miss
symons
chapter
i
henrietta
was
the
third
daughter
and
fifth
child
of
and
symons
so
that
enthusiasm
for
babies
had
declined
in
both
parents
by
the
time
she
arrived
still
in
her
first
few
months
she
was
bound
to
be
important
and
take
up
a
great
deal
of
time
when
she
was
two
another
boy
was
born
and
she
lost
the
honourable
position
of
youngest
at
five
her
life
attained
its
zenith
she
became
a
very
pretty
charming
little
girl
as
her
two
elder
sisters
had
done
before
her
it
was
not
merely
that
she
was
pretty
but
she
suddenly
assumed
an
air
of
graciousness
and
dignity
which
captivated
everyone
some
very
little
girls
do
acquire
this
air
what
its
source
is
no
one
knows
in
this
case
certainly
not
and
symons
who
were
particularly
clumsy
etta
as
she
was
called
was
often
summoned
from
the
nursery
when
visitors
came
so
were
minna
and
louie
her
elder
sisters
but
all
the
ladies
wanted
to
talk
to
etta
minna
and
louie
had
by
this
time
at
nine
and
eleven
advanced
to
the
ugly
uninteresting
stage
and
they
owed
henrietta
a
grudge
because
she
had
annexed
the
petting
that
used
to
fall
to
them
they
had
their
revenge
in
whispering
interminable
secrets
to
one
another
of
which
etta
could
hear
stray
sentences
ellen
says
she
knows
arthur
was
very
naughty
because
but
we
wo
tell
etta
she
was
very
susceptible
to
notice
and
the
petting
was
not
good
for
her
when
she
was
eight
her
zenith
was
past
and
her
plain
stage
began
her
charm
departed
never
to
return
and
she
slipped
back
into
insignificance
at
eight
she
could
no
longer
be
considered
a
baby
to
play
with
and
a
good
deal
of
was
deemed
necessary
to
counteract
the
previous
spoiling
in
henrietta
youth
sixty
years
ago
was
administered
unsparingly
she
did
not
understand
why
she
was
more
scolded
than
the
others
and
decided
that
it
was
because
ellen
and
miss
weston
and
her
mother
had
a
spite
against
her
symons
was
not
fond
of
children
and
throughout
childhood
she
was
delicate
so
that
henrietta
saw
very
little
of
her
her
chief
recollections
of
her
mother
were
of
scoldings
in
the
when
she
had
done
anything
specially
naughty
if
she
had
been
one
of
two
or
one
of
three
in
a
family
she
would
have
been
more
precious
but
as
one
of
four
daughters
another
girl
was
born
when
she
was
eight
she
was
not
much
wanted
symons
was
a
solicitor
in
a
country
town
and
the
problem
of
providing
for
his
seven
darkened
the
years
of
childhood
for
the
whole
symons
family
the
children
felt
that
their
parents
found
them
something
of
a
burden
and
in
those
days
there
was
no
cult
of
childhood
to
soften
the
hard
reality
the
two
older
boys
had
a
partnership
together
into
which
they
occasionally
admitted
minna
and
louie
minna
and
louie
had
beside
their
secrets
a
friend
named
rosa
harold
the
youngest
boy
did
not
want
any
person
only
toy
engines
he
and
etta
should
have
been
companions
but
he
said
she
cried
and
told
tales
though
she
told
no
more
tales
than
he
did
a
large
family
should
be
such
a
specially
happy
community
but
it
sometimes
occurs
that
there
is
a
girl
or
boy
who
is
nothing
but
a
middle
one
fitting
in
nowhere
so
it
was
with
henrietta
till
the
youngest
child
was
born
unfortunately
she
had
an
almost
morbid
longing
unusual
in
a
child
to
be
loved
and
of
importance
now
she
would
have
given
anything
to
have
heard
minna
and
louie
secrets
not
for
the
sake
of
the
secrets
but
as
a
sign
that
she
was
thought
worthy
of
confidence
she
ran
errands
continually
but
she
broke
the
head
off
arthur
carnation
as
she
was
bringing
it
from
his
bedroom
to
the
garden
and
she
let
out
william
secret
which
he
had
told
her
in
an
unusual
fit
of
affability
in
order
that
she
might
curry
favour
with
minna
this
infuriated
william
and
did
not
conciliate
minna
she
grew
fast
and
was
a
little
delicate
it
made
her
irritable
but
her
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
all
growing
with
great
regularity
could
not
be
expected
to
understand
delicacy
she
always
said
she
was
sorry
after
she
had
been
cross
but
they
who
did
not
have
tempers
could
not
see
that
that
made
things
any
better
in
her
loneliness
she
made
for
herself
like
many
other
forlorn
children
a
phantom
friend
it
was
a
little
girl
two
years
older
than
she
was
for
henrietta
preferred
to
look
up
and
be
herself
in
an
inferior
position
for
this
reason
she
did
not
much
care
for
dolls
where
she
was
decidedly
the
superior
she
called
her
friend
amy
amy
slept
with
her
helped
her
with
her
lessons
told
her
secrets
perpetually
and
grumbled
about
the
other
children
one
day
they
all
had
a
game
at
hide
and
seek
the
lot
fell
on
her
and
william
now
fourteen
to
hide
they
ensconced
themselves
in
a
dark
spot
in
a
little
grove
at
the
end
of
the
garden
the
others
could
not
find
them
and
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
talk
william
was
a
kind
boy
and
rather
a
chatterbox
ready
to
expand
to
any
listener
even
a
sister
of
nine
henrietta
never
knew
how
it
was
that
she
told
him
about
amy
it
had
always
been
her
firm
resolve
that
this
was
to
be
her
own
dead
secret
never
revealed
but
the
unusual
warmth
of
the
interview
went
to
her
head
it
was
in
a
kind
of
intoxication
of
happiness
that
she
poured
out
her
confidence
the
shrubbery
was
so
dark
that
william
face
could
not
be
seen
but
he
began
fidgeting
and
soon
broke
in
i
say
what
hours
the
others
are
it
must
be
let
go
and
find
them
it
was
kind
of
william
to
snub
her
confidence
so
gently
but
the
disappointment
was
cruel
she
had
been
lifted
up
to
such
a
height
of
happiness
when
ellen
brushed
her
hair
at
night
she
noticed
her
dismal
looks
and
being
really
concerned
at
henrietta
want
of
control
she
said
bracingly
that
little
girls
must
never
be
when
the
lamp
was
put
out
henrietta
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
and
she
looked
back
on
that
evening
as
the
most
miserable
of
her
childhood
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
the
last
child
was
born
the
baby
girl
they
had
all
been
sent
away
and
henrietta
who
had
gone
by
herself
to
an
aunt
came
back
later
than
the
others
they
had
seen
the
new
arrival
and
had
got
over
their
very
moderate
excitement
ellen
asked
henrietta
if
she
would
like
to
have
a
peep
at
her
little
sister
when
henrietta
saw
it
she
determined
that
it
should
be
her
own
baby
oh
you
little
darling
you
darling
darling
baby
she
murmured
over
and
over
again
now
you
are
happy
are
you
miss
etta
said
ellen
she
had
always
felt
sorry
for
henrietta
out
in
the
cold
the
baby
very
much
improved
etta
circumstances
ellen
allowed
her
to
help
and
she
had
something
to
care
for
so
she
had
less
occasion
for
interviews
with
her
phantom
friend
as
she
grew
older
the
baby
evelyn
requited
her
affection
with
a
gratifying
preference
but
she
was
very
and
would
like
everybody
and
not
make
a
party
against
minna
and
louie
as
henrietta
desired
she
came
to
the
pretty
age
and
was
prettier
and
more
charming
than
any
of
them
when
the
pretty
age
ought
to
have
passed
she
remained
as
attractive
as
ever
and
continued
to
enjoy
a
universal
popularity
this
was
disappointing
to
henrietta
she
would
have
preferred
them
to
be
pariahs
together
still
it
was
always
etta
that
evelyn
liked
best
when
evelyn
was
four
and
henrietta
thirteen
evelyn
was
given
a
canary
it
never
became
interesting
for
it
would
not
eat
off
her
finger
but
she
cared
for
it
as
much
as
a
child
of
four
can
be
considered
to
care
for
anything
the
canary
died
and
was
buried
when
evelyn
had
a
cold
and
was
in
bed
and
henrietta
went
by
herself
into
the
town
contrary
to
rules
and
spent
all
her
savings
at
a
little
low
getting
a
mangey
canary
she
brought
it
back
and
put
it
into
the
cage
and
when
evelyn
convalescent
came
into
the
nursery
she
attempted
to
palm
off
the
new
canary
as
evelyn
original
bird
this
strange
behaviour
brought
her
to
great
disgrace
her
only
explanation
was
i
did
want
evelyn
to
know
that
dickie
was
dead
i
think
death
is
so
dreadful
and
i
want
her
to
know
anything
dreadful
symons
and
the
governess
thought
this
most
inexplicable
etta
is
a
very
difficult
child
said
symons
she
always
has
been
so
unlike
the
others
and
now
this
dreadful
untruth
i
always
feel
an
untruth
is
very
different
from
anything
else
going
into
that
horrid
dirty
little
shop
you
must
watch
her
most
carefully
miss
weston
and
let
me
know
if
there
is
any
further
deceit
i
never
had
noticed
anything
before
symons
but
i
will
be
particularly
careful
and
miss
weston
took
the
most
elaborate
precautions
that
there
should
be
no
cheating
at
lessons
which
henrietta
resented
keenly
having
like
the
majority
of
girls
an
extreme
horror
of
cheating
chapter
ii
soon
after
the
incident
of
the
canary
the
three
older
girls
went
to
school
when
her
first
was
passed
henrietta
enjoyed
the
life
it
was
strict
but
home
had
been
strict
and
there
was
much
more
variety
here
she
was
clever
and
took
eager
delight
in
her
lessons

stupid
miss
weston
had
found
her
beyond
her
she
would
have
liked
school
even
more
if
her
temper
had
been
under
better
control
but
at
thirteen
she
had
settled
down
to
bad
temper
as
a
habit
she
did
not
exactly
put
her
feelings
into
thoughts
but
there
was
an
impression
in
her
mind
that
as
she
had
been
out
of
it
so
much
of
her
life
she
should
be
allowed
to
be
as
a
consolation
this
brought
her
into
constant
conflicts
which
made
no
one
so
unhappy
as
herself
she
had
two
great
interests
at
school
miranda
hardcastle
and
miss
arundel
miranda
was
the
kind
of
girl
whom
everybody
is
always
going
to
adore
very
pretty
very
amusing
and
with
much
cordiality
of
manner
henrietta
fell
a
victim
at
once
and
miranda
who
drank
in
all
adoration
gave
henrietta
some
friendship
in
return
henrietta
fagged
for
her
did
as
many
of
her
lessons
as
she
could
applauded
all
her
remarks
amply
rewarded
by
miranda
welcoming
smile
and
her
i
been
simply
pining
for
you
my
child
come
and
hear
me
my
french
at
once
like
a
seraphim
this
happy
state
of
things
continued
until
unfortunately
temper
over
which
she
had
kept
an
anxious
guard
in
miranda
presence
showed
signs
of
activity
the
first
time
this
occurred
miranda
opened
her
large
eyes
very
wide
and
said
what
come
over
my
young
friend
has
it
got
the
hydrophobia
i
shall
try
and
cure
it
by
kindness
and
give
it
some
chocolate
henrietta
clouds
dispersed
but
she
was
not
always
so
easily
restored
to
and
miranda
with
the
whole
school
at
her
feet
was
not
going
to
stand
bad
temper
the
fault
on
the
whole
least
easily
forgiven
by
girls
henrietta
had
a
heartrending
scene
with
her
at
fifteen
she
liked
heartrending
scenes
miranda
was
too
fond
of
popularity
to
give
henrietta
up
entirely
so
the
two
remained
friendly
but
they
were
no
longer
intimate
miss
arundel
was
the
sister
and
undertook
all
the
serious
teaching
that
was
not
in
the
hands
of
masters
she
did
not
have
many
outward
attractions
of
face
and
form
but
schoolgirls
will
know
that
that
is
not
of
much
importance
she
was
adored
possibly
because
she
had
a
bad
temper
bad
temper
is
an
asset
in
a
teacher
which
was
liable
to
burst
forth
unexpectedly
then
she
was
clever
and
enthusiastic
and
gave
good
lessons
she
marked
out
henrietta
and
it
came
round
that
she
had
said
etta
symons
is
an
interesting
girl
she
has
possibilities
i
wonder
how
she
will
turn
out
it
came
round
also
that
miss
arundel
had
said
i
only
wish
she
had
more
control
and
tenacity
of
purpose
but
this
sentence
henrietta
put
out
of
her
head
the
first
sentence
she
thought
of
for
hours
on
end
and
set
to
work
to
be
more
interesting
than
ever
in
fact
for
some
days
she
was
so
affected
and
exasperating
that
miss
arundel
could
hardly
contain
herself
still
even
miss
arundel
sarcasm
was
endurable
anything
was
endurable
after
that
gratifying
remark
when
miranda
ceased
to
be
her
special
friend
she
transferred
her
whole
heart
and
soul
to
miss
arundel
she
waylaid
her
with
flowers
hung
about
in
the
passage
on
the
chance
of
seeing
her
walk
by
and
waited
on
her
as
much
as
she
dared
some
teachers
apparently
enjoy
girl
adorations
and
even
take
pains
to
secure
them
miss
arundel
had
had
enough
of
them
to
find
them
disagreeable
she
therefore
gave
out
in
the
presence
of
two
or
three
of
henrietta
circle
that
she
thought
it
was
a
pity
etta
symons
wasted
so
much
of
her
on
buttonholes
which
gave
very
little
pleasure
to
anyone
certainly
not
to
her
who
particularly
disliked
strong
scents
she
thought
the
money
could
be
much
better
expended
jessie
winsley
repeated
this
speech
to
henrietta
little
thinking
what
anguish
it
would
cause
henrietta
had
very
little
pride
very
little
proper
pride
some
people
might
have
said
she
did
not
at
all
mind
giving
a
great
deal
more
than
she
got
but
this
speech
which
was
not
after
all
so
very
malignant
drove
her
to
despair
she
went
to
miranda
who
hugged
her
and
said
old
cat
barbaric
old
cat
never
think
of
her
again
she
is
worth
it
try
dear
little
stanley
he
a
pet
men
are
much
nicer
stanley
was
the
but
after
all
one
must
have
a
little
encouragement
to
start
an
adoration
and
as
henrietta
never
could
draw
she
got
none
from
stanley
besides
she
was
constant
so
instead
she
brooded
over
miss
arundel
she
had
not
been
so
unhappy
when
she
had
her
miranda
and
her
arundel
now
she
had
lost
them
both
miss
arundel
with
her
cool
unaffectionate
interest
had
of
course
never
been
had
at
all
but
henrietta
had
imagined
that
when
miss
arundel
said
yes
quite
right
that
a
good
answer
it
was
a
kind
of
beginning
of
friendship
she
henrietta
small
and
insignificant
was
singled
out
for
miss
arundel
friendship
that
was
what
she
thought
she
did
not
realize
that
it
was
possible
to
care
merely
for
intellectual
development
when
she
was
prepared
for
confirmation
there
were
serious
talks
about
her
character
the
vicar
whose
classes
she
attended
was
mostly
concerned
with
doctrines
and
marston
with
what
one
might
call
a
list
of
ideal
vices
and
temptations
which
pupils
must
guard
themselves
against
miss
arundel
talked
to
her
about
her
untidy
exercise
books
her
unpunctuality
her
loud
voice
in
the
corridor
and
her
round
shoulders
and
explained
very
properly
that
inattention
in
these
comparatively
small
matters
showed
a
general
want
of
she
did
not
speak
about
bad
temper
for
henrietta
was
much
too
frightened
of
her
to
show
any
signs
of
temper
in
her
proximity
miss
arundel
did
not
give
her
an
opportunity
of
unburdening
herself
of
the
problem
that
weighed
on
her
mind
not
that
she
would
have
taken
the
opportunity
if
it
had
occurred
not
after
that
speech
about
the
buttonholes
this
was
the
problem
why
was
it
that
people
did
not
love
her
she
to
whom
love
was
so
much
that
if
she
did
not
have
it
nothing
else
in
the
world
was
worth
having
there
had
been
evelyn
it
is
true
but
now
evelyn
did
lessons
with
a
little
friend
of
her
own
age
and
she
and
the
friend
were
all
in
all
and
did
not
want
henrietta
in
the
holidays
henrietta
reflected
that
she
was
not
uglier
or
stupider
or
duller
than
anyone
else
there
was
a
large
set
at
school
who
were
ugly
stupid
and
dull
and
they
were
devoted
to
one
another
though
they
none
of
them
cared
about
her
why
had
god
sent
her
into
the
world
if
she
was
not
wanted
she
found
the
problem
insoluble
but
a
certain
amount
of
light
was
thrown
on
it
by
one
of
the
girls
she
had
been
snarling
with
two
or
three
of
her
classmates
over
the
afternoon
preparation
and
had
flounced
off
in
a
rage
by
herself
she
felt
a
touch
on
her
arm
and
turning
round
saw
emily
mence
a
rather
uncouth
clever
girl
whom
she
hardly
knew
i
just
came
to
say
why
you
such
an
idiot
me
yes
why
do
you
lose
your
temper
like
that
all
the
girls
are
laughing
at
you
they
always
do
when
you
get
cross
then
i
think
it
horrid
of
them
well
you
ca
be
surprised
of
course
people
wo
stand
you
if
you
so
cross
wo
they
said
henrietta
and
the
one
thing
i
want
in
the
world
is
to
be
liked
do
you
really
fancy
wanting
these
girls
to
like
you
they
such
silly
little
things
i
should
mind
that
if
only
they
liked
me
like
you
said
emily
do
you
remember
you
said
charles
deserved
to
have
his
head
cut
off
because
he
was
so
stupid
and
all
the
others
gushed
over
him
did
i
i
do
like
the
other
girls
to
laugh
at
you
that
why
i
thought
i
would
tell
you
they
walked
up
and
down
the
path
and
talked
about
charles
i
here
there
seemed
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
but
it
was
nipped
in
the
bud
for
emily
left
unexpectedly
at
the
end
of
the
term
henrietta
received
no
further
overtures
from
any
of
the
girls
emily
words
had
made
an
impression
however
and
for
six
weeks
henrietta
took
a
great
deal
of
pains
with
her
temper
for
this
concession
on
her
part
she
expected
providence
to
give
her
an
immediate
and
abundant
measure
of
popularity
it
did
not
the
symons
family
had
not
the
quality
a
capricious
quality
which
withholds
itself
from
those
who
have
the
greatest
desire
and
even
apparently
the
best
right
to
possess
it
the
girls
were
kind
kinder
on
the
whole
than
the
world
and
they
were
perfectly
willing
to
give
her
their
left
arms
round
the
garden
but
their
right
would
be
occupied
by
their
real
friends
to
whom
they
would
be
telling
their
experiences
and
henrietta
would
only
come
in
for
a
was
it
sickening
etta
now
and
then
she
was
disappointed
and
she
relaxed
her
efforts
she
had
missed
the
excitement
of
saying
disagreeable
things
the
day
had
become
chilly
without
them
by
the
middle
of
the
term
she
was
as
disagreeable
as
ever
she
very
rarely
received
good
advice
in
her
life
and
now
that
she
had
got
it
she
made
no
use
of
it
if
she
had
it
might
have
changed
the
whole
of
her
future
but
from
henceforth
on
birthdays
new
year
eves
and
other
anniversaries
when
she
took
stock
of
herself
and
her
character
she
ignored
her
temper
and
would
not
count
it
as
a
factor
that
could
be
modified
there
were
others
as
lonely
as
herself
at
school
there
are
always
many
lonely
in
a
community
but
she
did
not
realize
this
and
felt
herself
exceptional
she
imagined
that
she
was
overwhelmed
with
misery
at
this
time
but
really
the
life
was
so
busy
and
she
was
so
fond
of
the
lessons
and
did
them
so
well
that
she
was
not
to
be
pitied
as
much
as
she
thought
it
was
clear
she
was
to
be
lonely
at
school
and
lonely
at
home
where
was
she
to
find
relief
there
was
a
supply
of
innocuous
for
the
perusal
of
marston
pupils
on
saturday
innocuous
that
is
to
say
but
for
the
fact
that
they
gave
a
completely
erroneous
view
of
life
and
from
them
henrietta
discovered
that
heroines
after
the
sixteenth
birthday
are
likely
to
be
pestered
with
adorers
the
heroines
it
is
true
were
exquisitely
beautiful
which
henrietta
knew
she
was
not
but
from
a
study
of
jane
eyre
and
villette
in
the
holidays
charlotte
brontë
was
forbidden
at
school
owing
to
her
excess
of
passion
henrietta
realized
that
the
plain
may
be
adored
too
so
she
had
a
modest
hope
that
when
the
magic
season
of
young
ladyhood
arrived
a
prince
charming
would
come
and
fall
in
love
with
her
this
hope
filled
more
and
more
of
her
thoughts
and
all
her
last
term
when
other
girls
were
crying
at
the
thought
of
leaving
she
was
counting
the
days
to
her
departure
chapter
iii
henrietta
was
eighteen
when
she
left
school
minna
and
louie
had
gone
two
or
three
years
before
and
by
the
time
henrietta
came
home
minna
was
engaged
to
be
married
there
was
nothing
particular
about
minna
she
was
capable
and
and
rather
and
could
dress
well
on
a
little
money
she
was
not
much
of
a
talker
but
what
she
said
was
to
the
point
on
these
qualifications
she
married
a
barrister
with
most
satisfactory
prospects
they
were
both
extremely
fond
of
one
another
in
a
quiet
way
and
fond
they
remained
she
was
disposed
of
satisfactorily
louie
was
prettier
and
more
lively
she
was
having
a
gay
career
of
flirtations
when
henrietta
joined
her
she
did
not
at
all
want
a
younger
sister
particularly
a
sister
with
a
pretty
complexion
three
years
of
parties
had
begun
to
tell
on
her
own
which
was
of
special
delicacy
she
and
henrietta
had
never
grown
to
like
one
another
and
now
there
went
on
a
sort
of
silent
war
an
unnecessary
war
on
louie
side
for
she
had
a
much
greater
gift
with
partners
than
henrietta
and
her
captives
were
not
annexed
but
for
her
complexion
there
was
nothing
very
taking
in
henrietta
whoever
travels
in
the
tube
must
have
seen
many
women
with
hair
brown
eyes
and
eyebrows
their
features
are
neither
good
nor
bad
their
whole
aspect
is
uninteresting
they
have
no
winning
dimples
no
speaking
lines
about
the
mouth
all
that
one
can
notice
is
a
disappointed
somewhat
peevish
look
in
the
eyes
such
was
henrietta
the
fact
that
she
had
not
been
much
wanted
or
appreciated
hitherto
began
to
show
now
she
was
eighteen
she
was
either
shy
and
silent
or
talked
with
too
much
positiveness
for
fear
she
should
not
be
listened
to
so
that
though
she
was
not
a
failure
at
dances
and
managed
to
find
plenty
of
partners
there
were
none
of
the
interesting
episodes
that
were
continually
occurring
on
louie
evenings
and
for
a
year
or
two
her
hopes
were
not
realized
the
prince
charming
she
was
waiting
for
came
not
sometimes
louie
was
away
on
visits
and
henrietta
went
to
dances
without
her
at
one
of
these
as
usual
a
strange
young
man
was
introduced
there
was
nothing
special
about
him
they
had
the
usual
talk
of
first
dances
then
he
asked
for
a
second
then
for
a
third
he
was
introduced
to
her
mother
she
asked
him
to
call
he
came
he
talked
mostly
to
her
mother
but
it
was
clear
that
it
was
henrietta
he
came
to
see
another
dance
another
call
and
meetings
at
friends
houses
and
wherever
she
was
he
wanted
to
be
beside
her
it
was
an
exquisitely
happy
month
he
was
a
commonplace
young
man
but
what
did
that
matter
there
was
nothing
in
henrietta
to
attract
anyone
very
superior
and
perhaps
she
loved
him
all
the
more
because
he
was
not
soaring
high
above
her
like
all
her
previous
divinities
but
walking
side
by
side
with
her
yes
she
loved
him
by
the
time
he
had
asked
her
for
the
third
dance
she
loved
him
she
did
not
think
much
of
his
proposing
of
their
marrying
just
that
someone
cared
for
her
at
first
she
could
not
believe
it
but
by
the
end
of
the
month
the
signs
clearly
resembled
those
of
young
men
flowers
a
note
about
a
book
he
had
lent
her
a
note
about
a
mistake
he
had
made
in
his
last
note
she
was
sure
he
must
care
for
her
the
other
girls
at
the
dances
noticed
his
devotion
and
asked
henrietta
when
it
was
to
be
announced
she
laughed
off
their
questions
but
they
gave
her
a
thrill
of
delight
all
must
be
well
and
if
they
had
married
all
would
have
been
well
there
might
have
been
jars
and
rubs
with
henrietta
jealous
disposition
there
probably
would
have
been
but
they
would
have
been
as
happy
as
the
majority
of
married
couples
she
would
have
been
happier
for
to
many
people
even
to
some
women
it
is
not
as
it
was
to
her
the
condition
of
existence
to
love
and
be
loved
at
the
end
of
the
month
louie
came
home
henrietta
had
dreaded
her
return
she
had
no
confidence
in
herself
when
louie
was
by
louie
made
her
cold
and
awkward
she
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
her
not
to
come
into
the
room
when
he
called
but
she
was
too
shy
there
had
never
been
any
intimacy
between
the
sisters
symons
however
spoke
to
louie
a
very
nice
young
fellow
with
perfectly
good
connections
not
making
much
yet
but
sufficient
for
a
start
it
would
do
very
well
louie
would
not
have
considered
herself
more
heartless
than
other
people
but
she
was
a
coquette
and
she
did
not
want
henrietta
to
be
settled
before
her
the
next
time
the
young
man
came
he
found
in
the
not
merely
a
very
much
prettier
miss
symons
that
in
itself
was
not
of
much
consequence
but
a
miss
symons
who
was
well
aware
of
her
advantages
and
knew
moreover
from
successful
practice
exactly
how
to
rouse
a
desire
for
pursuit
in
the
ordinary
young
man
henrietta
saw
at
once
though
she
fought
hard
that
she
had
no
chance
are
you
going
to
the
humphreys
he
said
to
louie
if
henrietta
crinoline
will
leave
any
room
in
the
carriage
answered
louie
i
shall
try
to
get
a
little
corner
perhaps
under
the
seat
or
one
could
always
run
behind
i
crushed
see
what
did
i
crush
a
little
piece
of
flounce
one
terrible
evening
did
i
henrietta
and
i
was
never
allowed
to
hear
the
last
of
it
she
smiled
a
special
smile
only
given
to
the
most
favoured
of
her
partners
the
young
man
thought
how
pretty
this
sisterly
teasing
was
on
the
part
of
the
lovely
miss
symons
henrietta
saw
it
in
another
light
my
crinolines
are
not
larger
than
yours
you
know
they
are
not
methinks
the
lady
doth
protest
too
much
do
you
mr
dockerell
and
you
always
take
the
best
seat
in
the
carriage
so
it
is
nonsense
to
say
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
loud
her
voice
was
please
let
us
change
the
conversation
said
louie
gently
it
ca
be
at
all
interesting
for
dockerell
i
am
ready
to
own
anything
you
like
that
you
do
wear
crinolines
at
all
if
that
will
please
you
if
there
is
any
difficulty
could
not
my
mother
take
one
of
you
night
it
was
louie
he
looked
at
she
is
staying
with
me
for
a
week
could
we
call
for
you
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
oh
thank
you
began
henrietta
really
said
louie
you
make
me
quite
ashamed
of
my
poor
little
joke
i
do
think
we
have
come
quite
to
such
a
state
of
things
that
two
sisters
ca
sit
in
the
same
carriage
i
hear
you
are
a
most
alarmingly
good
archer
dockerell
and
i
want
to
ask
you
to
advise
me
about
my
bow
if
you
will
be
so
kind
to
be
asked
advice
of
course
completed
the
conquest
dockerell
had
not
been
so
much
in
love
with
etta
as
with
marrying
it
took
him
a
very
short
time
to
change
but
when
he
had
made
his
offer
and
louie
had
discovered
that
he
was
too
dull
a
young
man
for
her
he
did
not
transfer
his
affections
back
to
henrietta
she
would
gladly
have
taken
him
if
he
had
he
left
the
neighbourhood
and
not
long
after
married
someone
else
in
this
grievous
trouble
henrietta
did
not
know
where
to
turn
for
comfort
symons
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
much
more
a
wife
than
a
mother
she
could
enter
into
all
symons
feelings
quite
remarkably
even
his
most
masculine
feelings
but
her
daughters
who
on
the
whole
were
very
ordinary
young
women
she
did
not
understand
perhaps
henrietta
was
not
altogether
ordinary
but
after
all
it
is
not
exceptional
to
want
to
be
loved
nor
did
symons
care
particularly
for
her
daughters
she
liked
her
sons
much
better
she
would
perhaps
have
been
happier
without
daughters
and
she
liked
henrietta
the
least
connecting
her
still
with
those
disagreeable
childish
interviews
when
henrietta
had
been
brought
down
black
and
sulky
to
be
scolded
henrietta
was
now
passing
through
what
is
not
an
extraordinary
experience
in
a
woman
life
she
had
loved
and
been
loved
and
then
had
been
disappointed
her
mother
in
her
distress
was
no
more
comfort
than
i
was
going
to
say
the
servants
but
she
was
much
less
for
ellen
now
symons
maid
gave
poor
henrietta
some
of
the
sympathy
for
which
she
hungered
evelyn
was
away
her
parents
had
consented
to
her
being
educated
with
the
little
friend
abroad
and
if
she
had
been
at
home
she
was
only
fourteen
too
young
to
be
of
much
use
however
henrietta
poured
out
her
bitterness
to
her
in
a
long
letter
and
evelyn
wrote
back
full
of
loving
sentiment
and
sentimentality
henrietta
wrote
also
to
miranda
and
had
a
sympathetic
letter
in
answer
most
sympathetic
considering
that
miranda
had
just
consummated
a
triumphant
engagement
to
the
son
of
an
earl
symons
could
not
help
thinking
that
henrietta
had
stupidly
muddled
her
affairs
and
wasted
the
good
chance
which
had
been
contrived
for
her
this
was
the
view
she
presented
to
her
husband
so
that
though
they
tried
not
to
show
it
in
their
manner
they
both
felt
a
little
aggrieved
it
was
to
william
that
she
turned
though
she
remembered
clearly
the
disappointing
interview
of
her
childhood
william
now
a
solicitor
in
london
came
home
for
a
few
days
holiday
the
sunday
of
his
visit
was
wet
when
and
symons
were
both
asleep
in
the
he
and
henrietta
sat
in
the
former
and
kept
up
friendly
about
the
neighbourhood
there
was
something
so
solid
and
comfortable
about
his
face
that
she
felt
she
must
tell
him
she
wanted
to
lean
on
someone
she
had
not
she
never
had
any
satisfaction
any
pride
in
battling
for
herself
yet
she
knew
that
william
face
was
deceptive
it
would
be
much
better
not
to
speak
she
determined
therefore
that
she
would
say
very
little
and
speak
as
coolly
as
she
could
she
began
but
before
she
could
stop
herself
the
whole
story
was
out
and
much
more
than
the
story
unbridled
abuse
of
louie
who
was
william
favourite
sister
she
only
stopped
at
last
because
her
sobs
made
it
impossible
to
speak
it
does
seem
unlucky
said
william
very
unlucky
i
should
talk
it
over
with
mother
mother
thinks
it
was
my
own
fault
i
know
she
does
well
um
write
to
minna
yes
you
might
write
to
minna
minna
is
only
interested
in
the
baby
she
hardly
ever
writes
besides
she
never
cared
about
me
at
all
she
would
be
glad
oh
well
i
should
think
it
was
worth
while
taking
it
to
heart
just
go
out
to
plenty
of
dances
and
be
jolly
you
must
mope
if
you
can
get
aunt
mercer
to
give
you
a
bed
i
take
you
to
the
play
that
will
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
it
very
kind
of
you
william
oh
that
all
right
well
going
to
the
window
it
no
good
staying
in
all
the
afternoon
it
makes
one
so
hipped
i
shall
take
a
turn
and
look
in
on
beardsley
on
my
way
back
tell
mother
not
to
wait
supper
for
me
she
knew
she
had
better
have
said
nothing
he
hated
the
recesses
of
the
heart
being
revealed
particularly
those
special
recesses
of
a
heart
he
had
thought
her
unmaidenly
but
he
was
sorry
for
her
he
took
her
to
the
play
a
rousing
farce
for
he
was
one
of
those
who
naively
consider
that
two
hours
of
laughing
can
compensate
for
months
of
misery
and
even
be
a
remedy
he
gave
her
a
brooch
also
and
said
to
his
mother
i
think
etta
gets
low
by
herself
now
minna
is
married
and
louie
is
away
why
should
she
go
for
some
visits
it
may
seem
strange
that
henrietta
should
have
spread
broadcast
a
grief
which
most
people
would
keep
hidden
in
their
own
hearts
but
it
is
one
of
the
saddest
things
about
lonely
people
that
having
no
proper
confidant
they
tell
to
all
and
sundry
what
ought
never
to
be
told
to
more
than
one
when
however
the
overmastering
desire
for
sympathy
had
passed
words
can
not
express
her
regret
that
she
had
spoken
for
years
and
years
afterwards
it
would
suddenly
come
upon
her
i
told
him
and
he
despised
me
and
she
would
beat
her
foot
on
the
floor
with
all
her
might
in
a
useless
transport
of
remorse
both
louie
and
henrietta
had
felt
it
was
wiser
not
to
see
too
much
of
one
another
after
dockerell
proposal
louie
had
gone
away
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
and
when
she
came
back
henrietta
went
for
a
long
visit
to
minna
with
two
babies
the
youngest
very
delicate
minna
was
completely
absorbed
she
was
emphatically
willard
now
not
minna
symons
symons
had
told
her
something
of
henrietta
circumstances
and
minna
considered
that
the
best
balm
would
be
her
babies
so
they
might
have
been
for
people
with
a
natural
admiration
for
babies
but
this
henrietta
had
not
got
if
minna
children
had
been
neglected
she
would
have
loved
them
dearly
but
when
they
were
surrounded
by
the
jealous
care
of
mother
nurse
nursemaid
and
if
any
space
was
left
for
him
father
there
was
nothing
for
her
but
to
look
on
as
an
outsider
it
was
during
this
visit
that
she
heard
of
the
young
man
engagement
she
did
not
realize
till
she
heard
how
tightly
she
had
been
clinging
to
the
hope
that
he
might
come
back
close
following
on
that
came
the
news
that
louie
was
engaged
to
a
most
amiable
and
agreeable
colonel
this
made
her
more
bitter
if
it
was
possible
to
be
more
bitter
against
louie
than
before
louie
was
not
merely
let
off
for
what
she
did
but
was
to
have
every
happiness
given
to
her
why
the
old
problem
of
her
confirmation
year
pressed
itself
on
her
only
now
she
felt
less
mournful
and
more
acrid
her
troubles
made
her
peevish
and
disagreeable
as
was
apparent
from
minna
kindly
admonition
i
think
said
she
as
they
sat
sewing
one
morning
that
i
really
ought
to
warn
you
not
to
talk
quite
so
loud
and
so
positively
i
like
saying
anything
but
of
course
i
am
older
than
you
and
that
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
spoils
a
girl
chances
men
do
like
it
and
your
temper
even
arthur
noticed
it
and
he
is
not
at
all
an
observant
man
i
daresay
you
hardly
realize
the
importance
of
a
good
temper
etta
but
in
my
opinion
it
makes
more
difference
in
life
than
anything
else
henrietta
came
back
three
days
before
louie
wedding
louie
repented
the
injury
she
had
done
and
on
the
last
night
she
came
into
room
and
apologized
you
know
etty
i
am
very
sorry
very
very
sorry
of
course
i
had
no
idea
how
you
felt
about
him
he
was
the
sort
of
man
one
could
take
very
seriously
at
least
that
was
what
i
thought
anyhow
i
would
worry
about
it
any
more
for
you
know
i
think
he
can
not
have
been
very
seriously
touched
or
he
would
have
made
some
effort
to
see
you
again
surely
after
his
little
episode
with
me
louie
felt
more
than
her
words
conveyed
but
she
could
not
demean
herself
to
show
too
much
perhaps
you
did
mean
it
unkindly
said
henrietta
i
shall
try
to
believe
you
but
you
wrecked
my
life
etta
is
so
exaggerated
and
hysterical
said
louie
afterwards
talking
things
over
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
henrietta
spoke
only
the
sober
truth
chapter
iv
after
louie
wedding
henrietta
went
to
stay
with
an
aunt
her
eldest
sister
almost
a
generation
older
than
he
was
she
lived
in
a
little
white
house
in
the
country
with
a
green
verandah
and
french
windows
she
was
a
kind
nice
old
lady
not
well
off
a
humble
to
the
whole
village
children
continually
came
to
eat
her
mulberries
girls
were
found
places
sick
people
were
sent
jelly
and
there
was
always
a
great
deal
of
sewing
and
knitting
for
poor
friends
she
did
her
best
to
make
the
visit
pass
cheerfully
she
had
some
little
scheme
of
pleasure
for
each
day
and
so
many
people
came
and
went
that
though
not
exciting
the
life
could
not
possibly
be
called
dull
henrietta
did
not
know
whether
symons
had
mentioned
her
trouble
to
her
aunt
she
hoped
not
now
that
the
first
shock
was
over
she
had
become
sensitive
on
the
subject
and
did
not
wish
to
speak
about
it
from
a
little
speech
her
aunt
made
it
is
possible
that
symons
had
said
something
one
day
as
they
sat
talking
comfortably
and
confidentially
over
the
fire
the
conversation
turned
on
her
aunt
past
days
she
had
been
left
motherless
the
eldest
of
a
large
family
when
she
was
nineteen
or
twenty
it
was
evidently
her
duty
to
devote
herself
to
the
younger
ones
and
when
a
man
presented
himself
whom
she
loved
and
by
whom
she
was
loved
she
felt
that
she
could
not
be
spared
from
home
henrietta
saw
that
she
was
bracing
herself
to
say
something
at
last
out
it
came
you
know
my
dear
i
think
in
spite
of
i
mean
that
there
are
many
things
besides
though
when
one
has
hoped
still
life
can
be
very
happy
very
peaceful
without
why
there
is
this
garden
and
there
are
those
three
darling
little
children
next
door
henrietta
knew
that
this
unanalysable
sentence
was
meant
to
comfort
her
she
felt
grateful
but
she
was
not
comforted
her
aunt
life
was
the
sweetest
and
happiest
possible
for
old
age
but
could
she
at
twenty
settle
down
to
devising
treats
for
other
people
children
or
sewing
garments
for
the
poor
it
made
her
feel
sick
and
dismal
to
think
of
it
besides
their
circumstances
were
not
similar
her
aunt
fortified
by
the
spirit
of
had
resigned
what
she
loved
but
she
had
the
reward
of
being
the
most
necessary
member
of
her
circle
henrietta
had
had
no
scope
for
for
she
had
never
had
anything
to
give
up
in
fact
she
envied
her
aunt
for
she
realized
now
that
dockerell
could
never
have
cared
for
her
and
far
from
being
the
most
necessary
member
of
her
family
her
difficulty
was
to
squeeze
into
a
place
at
all
the
visit
came
to
an
end
she
went
home
and
regular
life
began
again
since
one
ordinary
young
man
had
been
attracted
to
her
when
she
was
twenty
there
seemed
no
reason
why
other
ordinary
men
should
not
continue
to
be
attracted
as
he
had
been
in
love
with
marrying
rather
than
with
her
so
she
had
been
in
love
with
being
loved
rather
than
with
him
she
would
have
accepted
almost
any
pleasant
young
man
provided
he
had
had
the
supreme
merit
of
caring
for
her
but
the
inscrutable
fate
which
rules
these
matters
decreed
that
it
was
not
to
be
no
other
suitor
presented
himself
for
one
thing
she
went
to
fewer
parties
now
after
louie
marriage
symons
who
had
worked
hard
in
the
good
cause
of
finding
husbands
began
to
flag
henrietta
was
not
so
gratifying
to
take
out
as
louie
had
been
particularly
as
her
complexion
went
off
early
and
without
her
complexion
she
had
nothing
to
fall
back
on
so
symons
gave
herself
up
to
the
luxury
of
bad
health
and
said
she
could
not
stand
late
hours
when
henrietta
did
go
out
her
experience
made
her
feel
that
she
was
unlikely
to
please
and
though
no
one
can
define
what
produces
attractiveness
it
is
safe
to
say
that
one
of
the
most
necessary
elements
is
to
believe
oneself
attractive
symons
had
not
hitherto
taken
great
interest
in
his
daughters
but
when
minna
and
louie
were
married
he
became
fonder
of
them
he
was
one
of
those
men
whose
good
opinion
of
a
woman
is
much
strengthened
if
confirmed
by
another
man
his
daughters
husbands
had
confirmed
his
opinion
in
the
most
satisfactory
way
by
marrying
them
whereas
his
good
opinion
of
henrietta
far
from
being
confirmed
had
been
rather
weakened
minna
and
louie
virtues
husbands
and
houses
were
often
extolled
now
and
there
was
nothing
to
extol
in
her
henrietta
felt
this
continually
her
parents
did
not
speak
to
her
of
her
misfortunes
she
was
left
alone
which
is
perhaps
what
most
girls
would
have
liked
best
not
so
henrietta
the
three
years
after
louie
marriage
were
the
most
miserable
of
henrietta
life
if
she
did
not
go
out
to
parties
what
was
she
to
do
the
housekeeping
the
housekeeping
as
in
many
cases
was
not
nearly
enough
to
provide
her
mother
with
occupation
it
certainly
could
not
be
divided
into
occupation
for
two
nursing
her
mother
her
mother
much
preferred
that
ellen
on
whom
she
had
become
very
dependent
should
do
what
was
necessary
and
for
companionship
she
had
all
she
wanted
in
her
husband
he
was
away
for
several
hours
in
the
day
however
and
during
his
absence
henrietta
did
drive
out
with
her
mother
read
to
her
and
sit
with
her
and
as
they
were
so
much
together
and
shared
the
small
events
of
the
country
town
they
were
to
a
certain
extent
drawn
together
but
symons
always
treated
henrietta
haut
en
and
snubbed
her
when
she
thought
necessary
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
of
ten
so
that
henrietta
was
constrained
and
a
little
timid
with
her
there
was
the
suggestion
of
a
feeling
that
symons
was
to
be
pitied
for
having
henrietta
still
on
her
hands
if
henrietta
had
refused
to
be
snubbed
there
would
have
been
none
of
that
suggestion
evelyn
was
still
away
at
school
there
were
a
certain
number
of
girls
of
henrietta
age
whom
she
saw
from
time
to
time
but
as
her
mother
did
not
wish
to
be
disturbed
by
entertaining
they
were
not
asked
to
the
house
and
therefore
did
not
ask
henrietta
to
theirs
besides
she
was
sensitive
thinking
truly
that
they
were
discussing
her
misfortune
and
did
not
want
to
see
them
in
addition
to
the
poignancy
of
disappointment
of
present
dulness
and
aimlessness
henrietta
realized
forcibly
though
perhaps
not
forcibly
enough
for
the
truth
that
the
years
between
eighteen
and
thirty
were
her
marrying
years
which
slowly
as
they
passed
from
the
point
of
view
of
her
happiness
went
only
too
fast
when
she
considered
that
once
gone
they
could
never
come
back
and
that
as
they
fled
they
took
her
chances
with
them
fifty
years
ago
the
large
majority
of
the
girls
of
her
class
married
early
and
the
years
of
home
life
after
school
were
arranged
on
the
supposition
that
they
were
a
short
period
of
preparation
for
marriage
it
did
not
matter
to
minna
and
louie
that
they
had
no
interests
to
fill
their
days
that
their
life
had
been
nothing
but
parties
and
intervals
of
waiting
for
parties
because
it
had
only
lasted
four
or
five
years
it
had
done
what
it
was
intended
to
do
it
had
settled
them
very
comfortably
with
husbands
but
with
henrietta
the
condition
which
was
meant
to
be
temporary
seemed
spreading
itself
out
to
be
permanent
and
with
the
parties
taken
away
she
was
hard
put
to
it
to
fill
up
her
days
she
longed
inexpressibly
for
school
for
its
restrictions
its
monotony
and
variety
and
to
think
that
when
she
had
the
luck
to
be
there
she
had
counted
the
days
to
being
a
young
lady
when
she
remembered
how
she
had
almost
wept
at
miss
arundel
description
of
joan
of
arc
her
mouth
watered
for
lessons
as
for
miss
arundel
herself
she
hungered
and
thirsted
after
her
at
last
she
had
a
happy
thought
she
decided
that
she
would
read
italian
read
dante
miss
arundel
had
taught
her
italian
and
she
would
write
to
miss
arundel
and
ask
her
to
recommend
a
good
translation
she
remembered
that
miss
arundel
and
marston
had
occasionally
had
favourite
old
pupils
to
stay
with
them
she
imagined
how
one
letter
might
lead
to
another
and
how
at
last
miss
arundel
might
invite
her
to
stay
too
she
wrote
her
letter
with
great
care
and
great
delight
constantly
changing
her
words
for
none
seemed
good
enough
for
miss
arundel
and
making
a
fair
copy
as
if
it
were
an
exercise
to
be
sent
up
for
correction
miss
arundel
received
the
letter
read
it
through
came
to
the
signature
and
could
not
for
the
life
of
her
remember
who
henrietta
symons
was
so
many
girls
had
passed
through
her
hands
and
she
lived
in
the
present
rather
than
the
past
a
teacher
was
ill
she
was
very
busy
the
letter
slipped
her
memory
one
evening
it
came
into
her
head
and
she
asked
her
sister
by
the
by
who
was
henrietta
symons
i
recollect
the
name
perfectly
said
marston
let
me
see
yes
now
i
know
there
were
three
of
them
one
was
minnie
i
believe
and
i
think
etta
had
a
bad
headache
at
the
picnic
it
was
a
blazing
day
that
year
the
hottest
i
ever
remember
and
i
had
to
come
back
early
with
her
of
course
i
remember
now
said
miss
arundel
a
girl
with
very
marked
eyebrows
and
she
wrote
back
a
postcard
tr
of
carey
ward
and
linsell
m
arundel
the
postcard
made
henrietta
inclined
to
back
out
of
dante
but
by
this
time
she
had
arranged
to
read
with
a
neighbour
carrie
bostock
so
she
had
to
make
a
start
they
did
start
but
as
they
neither
understood
the
italian
nor
the
translation
nor
the
notes
they
found
continual
excuses
for
not
reading
till
carrie
boldly
suggested
i
promessi
sposi
which
went
much
better
they
did
not
read
for
long
however
for
carrie
became
engaged
it
seemed
to
henrietta
that
everybody
she
knew
was
becoming
engaged
and
carrie
considered
her
engagement
an
occupation
which
gave
her
no
time
for
anything
else
certainly
no
time
for
italian
henrietta
found
she
did
not
read
by
herself
the
two
years
away
from
school
made
it
difficult
to
start
perhaps
it
may
seem
strange
that
a
girl
who
had
been
so
eager
at
school
should
not
care
to
work
by
herself
at
home
but
when
there
are
no
competitors
and
no
miss
arundel
work
loses
much
of
its
zest
for
everyone
except
the
real
student
who
is
rarely
to
be
found
among
men
still
more
rarely
among
women
and
the
last
thing
henrietta
would
ever
be
was
unusual
clever
interesting
schoolgirls
are
not
at
all
uncommon
though
not
so
general
as
clever
interesting
children
but
there
are
few
who
remain
clever
and
interesting
when
they
grow
up
uninspiring
surroundings
and
contact
with
life
or
mere
accumulation
of
years
take
something
away
or
perhaps
it
simply
is
that
when
they
are
grown
up
they
are
judged
by
a
more
severe
standard
miss
arundel
had
been
disappointed
again
and
again
but
she
would
not
have
been
surprised
that
henrietta
let
everything
go
for
she
had
always
observed
in
her
an
unfortunate
strain
of
weakness
besides
being
weak
henrietta
was
always
affected
by
the
people
she
was
with
and
the
atmosphere
of
home
life
was
not
encouraging
to
study
reading
italian
my
dear
her
mother
would
say
oh
ca
you
find
anything
better
to
do
than
that
surely
there
must
be
some
mending
while
her
father
advised
her
through
her
mother
not
to
become
too
clever
it
was
a
great
pity
for
a
girl
to
get
too
clever
after
all
there
seemed
no
earthly
reason
why
she
should
read
italian
it
gave
no
pleasure
to
herself
or
to
anyone
else
so
she
spent
most
of
the
long
leisure
hours
sitting
by
the
window
and
thinking
she
often
said
to
herself
the
verse
of
a
poem
then
just
published
by
christina
rossetti
she
had
seen
it
on
a
visit
copied
it
out
and
learned
it
downstairs
i
laugh
and
sport
and
jest
with
all
but
in
my
solitary
room
above
i
turn
my
face
in
silence
to
the
wall
my
heart
is
breaking
for
a
little
love
it
did
not
quite
apply
to
henrietta
for
she
was
not
sporting
and
jesting
downstairs
with
anyone
but
that
verse
was
the
greatest
comfort
to
her
of
those
dreary
years
the
writer
have
been
through
it
all
she
thought
she
knows
what
it
is
not
to
be
alone
to
have
someone
though
an
unknown
one
who
could
share
it
lightened
her
burden
when
she
was
in
a
mood
that
it
should
be
lightened
she
made
up
verses
too
and
wrote
them
in
a
pretty
album
she
bought
for
the
purpose
they
relieved
her
heart
a
little
at
any
rate
it
was
a
distraction
to
think
of
the
rhymes
she
would
have
shown
them
to
carrie
if
she
had
had
the
slightest
encouragement
but
as
carrie
gave
no
encouragement
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
while
nature
her
lavish
hand
and
fairest
flowers
displayed
was
his
to
taste
of
sunny
joys
was
mine
to
sit
in
shade
oh
talk
not
to
me
of
a
lasting
devotion
it
shrivels
it
ceases
it
fades
and
it
dies
in
the
heart
of
a
man
is
a
fleeting
emotion
alas
in
a
woman
eternal
it
lies
a
poet
would
have
said
that
anyone
capable
of
writing
that
was
incapable
of
feeling
but
he
would
have
been
wrong
sometimes
henrietta
used
to
have
a
phantom
lover
like
the
phantom
friend
of
her
childhood
but
now
had
she
more
or
less
imagination
as
a
child
she
could
not
bear
it
she
imagined
the
phantom
and
then
she
wanted
him
so
intensely
that
she
had
to
forget
him
the
aspect
of
certain
days
would
be
connected
with
some
peculiarly
mournful
moments
she
wondered
which
was
the
most
depressing
the
dark
setting
in
at
four
and
leaving
her
seven
hours
of
fancy
work
for
it
disturbed
her
mother
if
she
went
to
bed
before
eleven
or
the
summer
sun
that
would
not
go
down
if
only
some
kind
stroke
of
misfortune
had
taken
away
all
money
disagreeable
poverty
would
have
been
a
great
comfort
to
her
she
would
have
been
forced
to
make
an
effort
not
to
brood
and
concentrate
herself
on
her
misery
but
symons
on
the
contrary
continued
to
get
richer
and
throughout
her
fairly
long
dull
life
henrietta
was
always
cursed
with
her
tidy
little
income
but
interminable
as
the
time
seemed
it
passed
it
passed
so
that
reading
her
old
journal
with
the
record
of
her
happy
month
she
found
that
it
had
all
happened
five
years
ago
and
was
beginning
to
be
forgotten
she
felt
as
if
it
had
not
happened
to
her
but
to
some
ordinary
girl
who
had
ordinary
prosperity
at
the
same
time
her
lot
did
not
seem
so
bitter
as
it
had
done
she
had
become
used
to
it
though
she
herself
hardly
realized
it
and
certainly
could
not
have
said
when
the
change
had
come
she
was
not
now
particularly
unhappy
it
was
an
alleviation
that
her
mother
was
more
of
an
invalid
so
that
some
of
the
responsibilities
of
the
household
devolved
on
her
and
her
mother
leaned
on
her
a
little
she
was
certainly
not
the
prop
of
the
house
or
the
lodestar
to
which
they
all
turned
for
guidance
none
of
the
satisfactory
things
women
are
called
in
poetry
but
she
was
not
such
an
as
she
had
been
chapter
v
and
now
the
even
course
of
henrietta
life
was
interrupted
evelyn
returned
home
she
and
her
friend
were
both
grown
up
into
young
ladies
many
letters
had
passed
between
the
sisters
but
it
was
so
long
since
they
had
seen
one
another
that
each
felt
a
little
shy
at
the
meeting
evelyn
was
very
lovely
made
to
please
and
be
pleased
a
regular
heroine
universally
courted
though
always
courted
she
was
never
spoilt
and
was
a
most
affectionate
sister
and
daughter
but
the
old
particular
bond
which
had
attached
her
and
henrietta
no
longer
existed
she
was
equally
affectionate
to
minna
and
louie
still
her
coming
made
a
great
difference
to
henrietta
there
was
a
person
of
her
own
generation
and
way
of
thinking
to
converse
with
they
could
have
jokes
together
and
evelyn
was
still
full
of
schoolgirl
enthusiasm
she
had
numberless
schemes
of
occupation
duets
french
readings
and
splashwork
and
when
she
went
away
on
visits
there
were
her
letters
much
more
intimate
than
those
of
a
year
or
two
earlier
full
of
allusions
to
their
new
occupations
and
teasing
of
a
kind
complimentary
sort
which
was
new
and
very
delightful
to
henrietta
they
were
arranging
flowers
in
the
one
afternoon
roses
which
had
been
brought
to
evelyn
by
an
admirer
they
dropped
some
on
the
floor
both
stooped
to
pick
them
up
and
they
knocked
their
heads
together
evelyn
got
up
laughing
but
felt
her
hand
suddenly
snatched
and
kissed
with
a
long
eager
kiss
she
turned
round
startled
what
is
it
she
said
i
could
help
it
said
henrietta
half
hysterically
if
you
knew
what
it
is
to
me
to
have
you
back
i
ca
tell
you
is
it
dear
said
evelyn
i
so
glad
and
she
smoothed
forehead
with
a
pretty
gesture
full
of
sweetness
but
with
a
touch
of
condescension
in
it
she
had
listened
already
to
so
many
passionate
declarations
about
herself
one
that
very
afternoon
that
she
was
not
so
much
impressed
by
henrietta
as
most
younger
sisters
would
have
been
still
she
could
not
help
contrasting
herself
in
her
triumphant
youth
with
henrietta
disregarded
by
everyone
and
snubbed
and
symons
never
snubbed
evelyn
and
she
thought
for
a
moment
oh
i
thankful
i
not
her
but
she
put
the
thought
away
as
unkind
and
supposed
vaguely
that
henrietta
was
so
good
she
did
not
mind
now
that
evelyn
was
come
back
symons
roused
herself
from
her
invalidism
to
provide
amusements
for
her
so
little
was
possible
at
home
that
almost
at
once
a
round
of
gay
visits
was
arranged
minna
was
less
engrossed
now
that
the
babies
were
older
and
took
her
out
to
parties
and
louie
had
all
the
officers
of
her
husband
regiment
at
command
these
same
attractions
had
been
offered
to
henrietta
louie
had
been
most
sincerely
anxious
to
atone
for
the
past
and
had
invited
her
again
and
again
but
henrietta
had
always
refused
for
though
the
original
wound
was
healed
she
still
cherished
resentment
against
louie
evelyn
was
a
career
of
triumph
her
letters
and
louie
and
were
full
of
officers
and
parties
this
roused
henrietta
old
discontent
why
was
evelyn
to
have
everything
and
she
nothing
she
promptly
answered
herself
because
evelyn
is
so
sweet
and
beautiful
she
deserves
everything
she
can
get
but
the
question
refused
to
be
snubbed
and
asked
itself
again
she
hated
herself
for
envying
and
continued
to
envy
evelyn
came
home
from
her
visits
very
much
excited
and
interested
about
herself
but
still
not
unmindful
of
henrietta
let
me
come
in
to
your
room
etty
and
tell
you
everything
i
had
a
perfect
time
with
louie
she
was
a
dear
she
was
always
saying
who
shall
we
have
to
dinner
you
must
settle
so
i
just
gave
the
word
and
whoever
i
wanted
was
produced
louie
wishes
you
would
go
too
do
go
you
would
have
such
fun
she
gave
me
a
note
for
you
my
dear
etta
the
note
ran
the
is
having
a
dance
on
the
i
wish
you
would
come
and
stay
with
us
for
it
come
and
bring
evelyn
i
particularly
want
to
have
her
for
it
there
is
a
special
reason
everyone
is
enchanted
with
the
dear
little
thing
i
shall
be
disappointed
if
you
do
come
too
it
all
happened
such
years
ago
surely
we
may
forget
it
and
edward
is
always
asking
me
why
i
do
not
have
you
and
it
seems
so
absurd
when
i
have
no
proper
reason
to
give
i
shall
really
think
it
too
bad
of
you
if
you
do
come
your
n
carrington
henrietta
thinking
over
the
matter
found
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
go
at
she
felt
herself
rather
older
than
this
generation
at
and
thought
it
ridiculous
that
she
should
be
going
to
a
dance
but
once
she
was
there
louie
made
her
feel
so
much
at
home
she
found
her
remarks
were
so
warmly
welcomed
and
her
few
hesitating
sallies
so
much
enjoyed
that
she
began
to
think
that
after
all
she
was
not
completely
on
the
shelf
do
go
etta
stay
here
there
the
steeplechase
on
friday
i
want
you
to
see
that
no
thank
you
louie
said
henrietta
i
ca
leave
mother
longer
it
been
very
delightful
more
delightful
than
you
can
realize
perhaps
you
so
much
accustomed
to
it
but
i
must
get
back
now
that
really
is
nonsense
etta
mother
has
ellen
and
she
has
father
and
she
is
pretty
well
for
her
you
said
so
yourself
but
henrietta
persisted
in
her
refusal
for
she
had
all
the
strong
though
sometimes
unthinking
sense
of
duty
of
her
generation
well
if
you
will
go
you
must
but
now
you
have
begun
coming
come
often
write
a
line
whenever
you
like
and
propose
yourself
as
they
said
louie
whispered
have
you
forgiven
me
etty
yes
said
henrietta
that
all
past
and
gone
for
a
matter
of
fact
said
louie
he
is
not
very
happy
with
her
they
do
get
on
the
moffats
know
him
and
moffatt
told
me
oh
i
am
sorry
said
henrietta
but
she
was
not
displeased
evelyn
stayed
behind
and
louie
talked
henrietta
over
with
her
poor
ever
since
her
marriage
henrietta
had
been
poor
to
louie
poor
etta
really
is
and
when
she
gets
animated
she
unattractive
if
i
could
have
her
here
often
i
believe
i
could
do
something
for
her
when
evelyn
came
home
a
week
or
so
later
she
had
an
announcement
to
make
she
had
become
engaged
to
an
officer
a
friend
of
the
carringtons
who
had
been
staying
in
the
house
he
was
delightful
the
engagement
was
everything
that
was
to
be
desired
and
evelyn
was
radiant
henrietta
knew
that
such
an
announcement
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
but
she
had
so
longed
for
a
few
years
happy
intercourse
together
she
tried
to
think
only
of
evelyn
but
she
could
not
keep
back
all
that
was
in
her
mind
think
of
me
left
all
alone
it
was
so
dreary
and
when
you
came
you
made
everything
different
now
it
will
go
back
to
what
it
was
before
no
no
etty
darling
you
will
come
and
stay
with
us
for
months
and
months
no
i
sha
when
you
have
got
him
you
wo
want
me
yes
i
shall
i
shall
want
you
all
the
more
i
love
you
more
than
ever
done
in
my
life
my
darling
sister
we
always
been
special
we
two
have
we
ever
since
i
can
remember
henrietta
was
a
little
comforted
and
did
not
realize
that
though
evelyn
tenderness
was
absolutely
sincere
it
came
from
the
strange
expansion
of
the
heart
which
accompanies
true
love
and
was
not
habitual
the
marriage
took
place
almost
at
once
for
the
captain
regiment
was
ordered
on
foreign
service
and
evelyn
went
away
to
regions
where
it
was
not
possible
for
henrietta
to
visit
her
but
if
she
had
lived
in
england
henrietta
would
not
have
felt
herself
at
liberty
to
go
away
for
long
after
she
got
home
she
felt
glad
she
had
not
extended
her
visit
to
the
carringtons
for
symons
was
not
so
well
and
she
died
shortly
afterwards
and
henrietta
reigned
in
her
stead
chapter
vi
the
household
changed
now
two
new
elements
were
introduced
william
came
from
london
to
be
a
partner
in
his
father
firm
and
lived
at
home
and
harold
who
had
been
employed
by
an
engineer
in
the
north
found
work
in
the
neighbourhood
and
came
back
too
so
that
life
became
at
once
much
fuller
of
interest
and
importance
than
it
had
been
for
years
as
the
only
lady
of
the
house
she
was
bound
to
be
considered
to
make
decisions
to
have
much
authority
in
her
own
hands
and
at
she
greatly
appreciated
authority
if
she
was
not
to
have
love
she
would
at
any
rate
have
position
and
the
servants
found
her
an
exacting
mistress
symons
though
she
had
given
over
certain
duties
to
henrietta
had
kept
herself
head
of
the
house
to
the
time
of
her
death
she
had
a
way
with
servants
they
always
liked
her
and
stayed
with
her
but
latterly
she
had
let
things
slide
and
when
henrietta
took
her
place
she
found
much
to
criticize
most
of
the
servants
left
but
some
stayed
and
agreed
with
ellen
that
it
was
just
miss
henrietta
way
she
was
funny
sometimes
however
they
got
used
to
her
and
things
jogged
along
pretty
quietly
when
ellen
left
to
be
married
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
to
make
allowances
for
her
she
had
much
more
difficulty
and
symons
was
occasionally
disturbed
in
his
comfortable
library
by
an
indignant
apparition
which
declared
amid
gulps
that
it
had
no
wish
whatever
to
make
complaints
but
really
miss
henrietta
symons
thought
this
very
hard
ca
you
manage
to
make
them
decently
contented
we
never
used
to
have
this
sort
of
thing
he
would
say
henrietta
would
defend
herself
by
and
on
the
whole
felt
the
incident
was
creditable
to
her
as
showing
that
she
was
a
power
and
a
rather
dreaded
power
in
the
house
the
men
thought
also
that
they
were
under
a
needlessly
harsh
yoke
henrietta
grumbled
when
they
were
late
for
meals
or
creased
the
chintzes
or
let
the
dog
in
with
muddy
paws
from
a
combination
of
kindness
weakness
and
letting
things
slide
they
made
no
complaints
symons
always
remembered
and
felt
sorry
for
the
episode
which
henrietta
herself
had
almost
forgotten
and
he
was
determined
to
make
up
to
her
by
letting
her
be
as
unpleasant
as
she
liked
at
home
if
only
they
had
spoken
strongly
while
there
was
yet
time
they
did
not
realize
it
is
difficult
for
those
in
the
same
house
to
realize
where
things
were
tending
henrietta
temper
became
less
violent
there
are
fewer
occasions
for
losing
a
temper
when
one
is
grown
up
but
she
took
to
nagging
like
a
duck
to
water
but
if
they
made
no
complaints
the
men
left
her
to
herself
symons
spent
many
hours
at
his
club
and
her
brothers
entertained
their
friends
in
the
she
was
vaguely
disappointed
she
had
an
idea
gleaned
from
novels
and
magazines
that
as
the
home
daughter
to
a
widowed
father
the
home
sister
to
two
brothers
she
would
be
consulted
leant
on
confided
in
symons
missed
his
wife
at
every
turn
but
he
never
felt
henrietta
could
take
her
place
her
nagging
shut
up
his
heart
against
her
he
thought
it
silly
rather
unfairly
perhaps
for
she
inherited
the
habit
from
her
mother
and
he
had
never
thought
nagging
silly
as
to
william
and
harold
they
had
come
to
the
ages
of
and
without
any
wish
for
confidence
and
why
should
they
wish
to
confide
in
henrietta
she
was
not
wise
and
she
was
not
sympathetic
the
mere
fact
that
they
lived
in
the
same
house
with
her
caused
no
automatic
opening
of
the
heart
well
on
in
middle
life
william
became
engaged
and
suddenly
poured
out
everything
to
his
love
but
for
the
present
he
and
harold
were
content
to
go
through
life
never
saying
anything
about
themselves
to
anybody
in
fact
they
hardly
ever
thought
of
henrietta
she
would
have
been
astonished
if
she
had
known
what
an
infinitesimal
difference
she
made
in
their
lives
as
mistress
of
the
house
henrietta
was
promoted
to
the
circle
of
the
married
ladies
and
the
happiest
hours
of
her
life
were
spent
in
visits
she
and
they
interchanged
when
they
talked
about
servants
arrangements
prices
and
health
they
were
not
intimate
friends
perhaps
the
women
of
fifty
years
ago
did
not
have
the
faculty
of
staunch
and
close
possessed
by
our
generation
and
now
henrietta
did
not
very
much
want
to
make
friends
she
would
have
thought
intimacy
a
little
schoolgirlish
a
little
beneath
a
lady
dignity
her
parents
had
been
a
very
ordinary
couple
in
a
country
town
they
and
the
society
they
frequented
were
uncultivated
and
uninterested
in
everything
that
was
going
on
in
the
world
outside
the
men
of
course
were
occupied
with
their
professions
and
almost
all
the
ladies
had
large
growing
families
which
gave
full
scope
for
their
energies
henrietta
had
not
their
duties
and
was
better
off
than
the
majority
of
them
but
she
did
not
find
time
hang
heavy
on
her
hands
long
ere
this
she
had
learnt
the
art
of
getting
through
the
day
with
the
minimum
of
employment
now
of
course
her
various
duties
gave
her
a
certain
amount
to
do
but
not
enough
to
occupy
her
mind
profitably
she
often
said
i
am
so
busy
i
really
have
a
moment
to
spare
and
quite
sincerely
declined
the
charge
of
a
district
because
she
had
no
time
if
any
visitors
were
coming
to
stay
she
spoke
of
the
preparations
and
the
work
they
entailed
as
if
all
was
performed
by
her
single
pair
of
hands
what
with
louie
and
edward
coming
and
harold
going
to
the
tyrol
on
wednesday
i
can
not
think
how
i
shall
manage
but
i
suppose
with
a
resigned
smile
i
shall
get
through
somehow
she
was
persuaded
into
visiting
a
small
hospital
once
a
fortnight
for
an
hour
and
the
day
and
hour
were
much
dreaded
by
her
entourage
so
vastly
did
they
loom
on
the
horizon
and
so
submissively
must
every
other
event
wait
on
their
convenience
minna
and
louie
often
came
on
visits
with
their
children
the
three
sisters
got
on
much
better
than
formerly
though
minna
and
louie
were
both
too
much
absorbed
in
their
own
interests
to
give
henrietta
a
large
place
in
their
thoughts
minna
husband
failed
early
in
health
before
he
had
had
time
to
fulfil
his
promising
early
prospects
while
colonel
when
he
retired
from
the
army
occupied
his
leisure
in
speculation
and
greatly
diminished
that
attractive
fortune
of
his
all
three
sisters
had
a
certain
amount
of
money
left
to
them
by
their
mother
but
in
spite
of
this
minna
and
louie
were
now
both
comparatively
speaking
poor
while
henrietta
with
no
one
dependent
on
her
and
a
large
allowance
from
her
father
was
comfortably
off
louie
and
minna
quite
gave
up
talking
of
poor
henrietta
and
really
henrietta
has
done
very
well
for
herself
was
a
remark
frequently
exchanged
henrietta
had
always
been
generous
and
her
sisters
soon
came
to
expect
as
a
right
that
she
should
rescue
them
in
times
of
domestic
need
pay
for
a
nephew
schooling
send
a
delicate
niece
to
the
sea
and
give
very
substantial
presents
at
birthdays
and
christmas
their
point
of
view
seemed
to
be
that
if
anyone
had
been
so
lucky
as
to
keep
out
of
the
bothers
of
marriage
the
least
she
could
do
was
to
help
her
unfortunate
sisters
still
they
disliked
being
beholden
to
henrietta
and
half
intentionally
set
their
children
against
her
to
relieve
their
feelings
the
children
were
not
bad
children
but
henrietta
found
their
visits
burdensome
she
was
becoming
a
little
set
and
unwilling
to
be
disturbed
and
she
said
the
children
were
spoilt
minna
and
louie
had
determined
they
would
not
be
the
strict
parents
of
the
elder
generation
whereas
henrietta
who
remembered
all
the
snubbing
of
her
youth
wanted
to
have
her
turn
of
giving
snubs
and
this
did
not
make
her
popular
she
never
grew
very
fond
of
these
children
but
kept
her
affection
for
something
else
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
heart
with
such
peculiar
longing
for
love
was
to
be
satisfied
with
a
life
in
which
feeling
played
so
little
part
she
had
put
aside
the
desire
for
a
lover
now
she
was
not
one
of
the
women
whom
nothing
will
satisfy
but
marriage
on
the
whole
she
did
not
care
very
much
for
men
she
wanted
what
she
had
always
wanted
something
to
love
and
something
to
love
her
and
she
had
good
reason
to
hope
that
at
last
that
wish
might
be
realized
for
it
was
agreed
between
her
and
evelyn
that
if
there
were
any
children
she
was
to
bring
them
up
while
evelyn
was
abroad
round
this
hope
she
built
many
happy
schemes
henrietta
had
seen
very
little
of
evelyn
all
this
time
the
regiment
went
from
one
foreign
station
to
another
but
very
affectionate
letters
passed
between
the
two
for
some
years
no
children
were
born
then
came
a
little
girl
she
is
to
be
called
etta
said
evelyn
letter
and
you
know
she
is
your
baby
as
well
as
ours
do
you
remember
what
you
did
for
me
in
old
days
i
think
of
how
you
will
do
the
same
for
baby
and
i
could
not
bear
for
anyone
else
to
do
it
but
you
the
baby
died
in
the
first
year
then
came
a
little
boy
who
lived
an
even
shorter
time
then
another
little
girl
the
parents
and
henrietta
hardly
dared
to
hope
this
time
but
the
perilous
first
year
passed
then
although
she
was
always
very
delicate
a
second
third
and
fourth
then
when
the
plans
were
maturing
for
her
coming
home
she
died
too
it
seems
sometimes
as
if
death
can
not
leave
a
certain
family
alone
but
comes
back
to
it
again
and
again
evelyn
is
her
husband
wrote
and
if
she
stays
in
this
horrible
india
i
believe
i
shall
lose
her
too
i
am
going
to
exchange
if
i
can
to
a
home
regiment
or
i
shall
leave
the
army
i
do
not
care
what
we
do
as
long
as
i
get
her
away
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
keeps
thinking
of
how
you
will
feel
it
i
believe
a
good
cry
with
you
is
the
one
thing
that
might
comfort
her
henrietta
took
this
letter
to
her
father
and
implored
him
to
let
her
go
out
to
india
at
once
but
this
symons
though
kind
and
sympathetic
and
truly
sorry
for
evelyn
could
not
bring
himself
to
allow
he
was
getting
to
the
age
when
he
shrank
from
violent
upheavals
herbert
said
they
were
leaving
india
by
the
time
she
arrived
they
would
probably
be
gone
and
then
what
a
wild
goose
chase
it
would
be
then
of
course
she
could
not
go
alone
and
who
was
to
go
with
her
her
brothers
could
not
spare
the
time
and
he
did
not
feel
up
to
going
and
she
must
have
a
man
with
her
edward
no
certainly
not
since
his
speculations
edward
was
in
bad
odour
no
it
would
be
much
better
to
write
a
kind
letter
he
would
write
too
and
drop
this
really
foolish
scheme
which
would
among
other
things
be
very
costly
more
costly
than
he
felt
prepared
to
face
just
then
she
said
she
would
go
alone
then
you
would
go
entirely
without
my
sanction
it
is
a
perfectly
impossible
thing
for
a
young
lady
to
contemplate
you
have
never
even
been
on
the
continent
and
you
think
of
travelling
to
india
unattended
she
had
never
acted
in
opposition
to
her
parents
though
she
had
often
been
domineering
to
her
father
in
small
matters
when
he
had
not
resisted
she
was
always
weak
she
could
only
fight
when
the
other
side
would
not
fight
back
she
said
oh
father
i
must
go
and
when
he
said
nonsense
i
could
think
of
it
she
collapsed
partly
from
cowardice
partly
from
duty
though
her
father
was
not
in
the
least
either
and
with
a
little
serious
resistance
would
have
been
made
to
yield
she
felt
bitterly
the
reproach
in
evelyn
letter
if
only
you
could
have
come
she
did
not
feel
as
wildly
wretched
as
fifteen
years
ago
because
now
in
middle
age
what
she
passed
through
at
the
moment
was
not
of
the
same
desperate
importance
but
then
she
had
a
small
corner
of
hope
hidden
away
that
perhaps
something
might
happen
whereas
now
she
realized
clearly
that
the
prospect
which
had
given
her
her
chief
interest
and
delight
was
destroyed
for
ever
the
trouble
told
on
her
she
caught
a
chill
which
developed
into
pneumonia
she
was
dangerously
ill
for
some
weeks
and
when
she
was
better
she
was
long
in
getting
up
her
strength
because
she
had
no
wish
to
get
well
minna
and
louie
thought
it
odd
that
henrietta
should
fret
so
much
about
evelyn
children
whom
she
had
never
seen
she
has
always
seemed
to
make
so
much
more
fuss
over
them
than
over
her
own
nephews
and
nieces
in
england
of
course
it
was
natural
that
dear
evelyn
herself
should
be
distracted
but
for
henrietta
it
almost
seemed
a
little
exaggerated
when
she
was
well
enough
to
travel
the
doctor
recommended
the
south
of
france
for
the
winter
and
she
went
away
with
a
married
friend
the
carrie
bostock
of
the
italian
readings
it
was
all
very
pleasant
and
entertaining
to
henrietta
who
had
never
been
abroad
never
even
away
from
her
own
family
in
the
riviera
she
could
to
a
certain
extent
drown
thought
but
she
counted
the
days
with
consternation
as
each
one
in
its
flight
brought
her
nearer
to
taking
up
life
again
at
home
one
afternoon
she
received
a
letter
from
her
father
my
dear
henrietta
it
ran
i
do
not
know
if
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
that
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
mrs
waters
we
have
not
known
one
another
very
long
but
i
must
say
i
very
soon
felt
that
she
would
be
one
who
could
take
your
dear
mother
place
i
think
it
is
very
possible
that
you
may
have
observed
whither
matters
were
tending
i
feel
certain
that
we
shall
all
be
very
happy
together
and
i
hope
you
will
write
her
a
warm
letter
of
welcome
to
our
family
she
will
i
am
sure
be
both
mother
and
sister
to
you
etc
the
news
was
staggering
to
henrietta
she
had
been
so
engrossed
in
her
own
trouble
that
she
had
observed
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
mrs
waters
a
widow
who
had
lately
settled
in
the
neighbourhood
had
been
several
times
to
their
house
and
had
entertained
them
at
hers
but
that
she
should
be
anything
more
than
a
friendly
acquaintance
had
never
entered
henrietta
head
she
was
to
be
ousted
her
mother
was
to
be
ousted
and
she
was
to
give
a
warm
welcome
to
the
interloper
her
forgotten
temper
burst
forth
she
wrote
a
violent
letter
to
her
father
hurling
at
him
all
the
ridiculous
exaggerated
things
that
most
people
feel
at
the
beginning
of
a
rage
but
which
few
are
so
mad
as
to
commit
to
paper
she
refused
altogether
to
write
to
mrs
waters
she
also
relieved
herself
by
contradicting
everything
carrie
said
thus
giving
her
a
good
excuse
for
those
long
talks
to
a
third
party
which
frequently
take
place
when
friends
have
been
abroad
together
beginning
i
really
had
no
idea
she
after
she
had
written
the
letter
as
usual
she
was
very
much
ashamed
she
wrote
again
unsaying
all
she
had
said
but
her
father
had
been
too
much
wounded
to
reply
she
came
back
just
a
little
before
the
wedding
to
see
him
in
quite
a
new
light
a
lover
for
he
at
and
mrs
waters
at
had
fallen
in
love
when
henrietta
saw
more
of
her
stepmother
to
be
she
had
in
honesty
to
own
that
she
liked
her
she
was
not
only
very
attractive
but
she
was
so
thoroughly
nice
and
kind
so
intent
on
making
people
happy
so
entirely
without
airs
of
patronage
and
henrietta
could
see
how
everybody
warmed
under
her
smile
henrietta
had
settled
that
she
would
not
live
at
home
after
the
marriage
neither
she
nor
her
father
could
forget
the
letter
it
was
better
that
they
should
part
she
had
again
asked
his
forgiveness
but
neither
felt
at
ease
with
the
other
she
stayed
for
a
few
weeks
after
and
symons
came
back
from
the
honeymoon
and
saw
almost
with
consternation
how
the
spirit
of
the
house
changed
it
became
peaceful
cordial
harmonious
it
would
not
have
been
known
for
the
same
house
the
whole
household
liked
symons
even
her
own
dog
deserted
henrietta
it
was
not
that
she
was
ousted
from
her
place
it
was
that
symons
created
a
place
which
never
had
been
hers
she
had
had
no
idea
in
all
these
twelve
years
how
little
she
had
made
herself
liked
she
had
had
her
chance
her
one
great
chance
in
life
and
she
had
missed
it
when
she
went
away
there
were
kind
good
wishes
for
her
prosperity
interest
in
her
plans
many
hopes
that
she
would
visit
them
but
no
regret
with
a
clearness
and
honesty
of
sight
she
unfortunately
possessed
she
realized
that
no
regret
what
was
the
use
of
twelve
years
in
which
she
had
sincerely
tried
to
do
her
best
if
she
had
not
built
up
some
little
memorial
of
affection
it
was
the
old
complaint
of
all
her
life
i
am
not
wanted
the
anguish
she
had
shared
with
evelyn
and
her
husband
had
been
much
sharper
but
in
the
midst
of
it
there
had
been
consolation
in
the
exquisite
union
they
had
felt
with
the
children
and
with
one
another
here
there
was
nothing
to
cheer
her
there
is
not
much
consolation
when
one
fails
where
it
seems
quite
easy
for
others
to
succeed
now
that
it
became
evident
that
she
would
be
so
little
missed
she
was
in
haste
to
get
the
parting
over
and
be
gone
but
her
unadventurous
spirit
shrank
from
going
out
in
the
world
to
manage
by
itself
she
was
very
doubtful
what
she
should
do
she
would
not
have
been
welcomed
by
minna
or
louie
even
if
she
had
wished
to
live
with
them
her
second
brother
was
in
some
inaccessible
foreign
place
evelyn
and
herbert
were
also
far
out
of
reach
he
had
exchanged
into
a
regiment
which
was
quartered
at
halifax
in
canada
but
the
distance
however
great
might
have
been
faced
if
she
had
not
had
a
miserable
quarrel
with
herbert
it
began
with
some
misunderstanding
about
the
tombstone
on
the
youngest
little
grave
to
which
henrietta
had
wished
to
contribute
she
had
written
to
evelyn
from
the
riviera
in
all
the
soreness
of
nerves
and
grief
from
which
the
sublimity
has
gone
the
very
fact
that
they
had
been
drawn
so
close
to
one
another
made
her
specially
irritable
to
evelyn
after
one
or
two
of
her
letters
an
answer
came
from
herbert
evelyn
is
very
ill
from
all
she
has
been
through
and
the
doctor
says
it
is
most
important
that
she
should
be
kept
from
every
sort
of
worry
she
was
so
much
distressed
at
your
last
letter
and
answering
you
took
so
much
out
of
her
that
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
keeping
this
one
from
her
you
have
no
right
to
write
to
her
in
this
way
and
i
must
ask
you
to
drop
all
correspondence
for
the
present
if
your
letters
are
to
be
in
the
same
strain
henrietta
declared
that
he
was
trying
to
come
between
her
and
her
sister
and
that
if
that
was
the
case
she
should
never
trouble
them
again
she
did
not
write
at
all
for
several
weeks
then
she
felt
remorseful
but
herbert
could
not
forgive
her
he
wrote
coldly
that
evelyn
was
still
so
unhinged
as
to
be
incapable
of
receiving
letters
without
undue
excitement
chapter
vii
even
now
when
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
choice
and
liberty
a
woman
who
is
thrown
on
her
own
resources
at
with
no
previous
training
and
no
obvious
claims
and
duties
does
not
find
it
very
easy
to
know
how
to
dispose
of
herself
but
a
generation
ago
the
problem
was
far
more
difficult
henrietta
was
well
off
for
a
single
woman
but
she
was
incapable
and
not
easy
to
get
on
with
she
would
have
thought
it
derogatory
to
do
any
form
of
teaching
teaching
the
natural
refuge
of
a
workless
woman
three
or
four
courses
presented
themselves
first
philanthropy
she
was
not
really
more
philanthropic
than
she
had
been
at
twenty
when
her
aunt
had
described
to
her
the
happiness
of
living
for
others
but
she
felt
at
nearly
forty
that
charitable
work
was
a
reasonable
way
of
filling
up
her
time
on
the
whole
the
most
reasonable
she
never
had
had
much
to
do
with
poor
people
symons
had
helped
the
charwoman
and
the
gardener
and
the
driver
from
the
when
they
were
in
special
difficulties
and
henrietta
had
continued
to
do
so
and
had
had
her
hour
at
the
hospital
that
was
all
there
were
the
servants
of
course
but
with
the
exception
of
ellen
she
looked
on
servants
more
as
machines
made
for
her
convenience
liable
to
get
out
of
order
unless
they
were
constantly
watched
entirely
without
enthusiasm
and
with
a
dreary
fighting
against
her
lot
she
made
inquiries
among
her
acquaintances
as
to
where
she
might
find
charitable
work
at
length
somebody
knew
somebody
who
knew
somebody
who
was
working
in
london
under
a
clergyman
after
further
inquiries
it
was
found
that
the
somebody
was
a
lady
who
would
be
very
glad
if
henrietta
would
come
and
live
with
her
while
she
saw
how
she
liked
the
work
the
clergyman
the
lady
and
all
the
other
workers
were
earnest
enthusiastic
and
full
of
common
sense
henrietta
was
not
one
of
these
things
she
was
also
very
inaccurate
unpunctual
and
forgetful
and
if
her
failings
were
pointed
out
to
her
in
the
gentlest
way
she
took
offence
not
because
she
was
conceited
but
because
at
her
age
she
was
beyond
having
things
pointed
out
she
stayed
at
the
work
six
months
and
during
that
time
she
was
always
offended
with
somebody
and
sometimes
with
everybody
the
work
was
conducted
more
on
charity
organization
lines
than
was
usual
in
those
days
money
was
not
given
without
due
consideration
and
consultation
this
was
difficult
and
required
more
thinking
than
henrietta
cared
for
so
she
saved
herself
trouble
by
bestowing
five
shillings
whenever
she
wanted
feeling
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
that
if
she
could
not
be
liked
for
herself
she
would
buy
liking
rather
than
not
be
liked
at
all
the
five
shillings
however
did
not
buy
either
gratitude
or
affection
she
had
always
had
a
grudging
way
with
people
of
a
different
class
from
herself
and
a
conviction
in
spite
of
indiscriminate
alms
that
she
was
being
taken
in
this
infringement
of
the
rules
drove
the
vicar
to
exasperation
his
whole
heart
was
in
his
work
and
henrietta
disloyalty
hindered
him
at
every
turn
ca
she
be
asked
to
give
up
meddling
in
the
parish
he
said
to
his
wife
no
dear
you
know
she
ca
and
she
is
very
generous
even
if
she
is
tiresome
she
has
often
been
very
helpful
to
you
you
ought
to
be
grateful
i
not
grateful
he
said
striding
about
the
room
and
then
she
is
so
petty
always
these
absurd
squabbles
she
has
got
a
spark
of
love
for
god
or
man
that
at
the
root
of
it
all
we
do
want
a
person
of
that
sort
here
if
she
cared
about
the
people
even
if
she
did
pauperize
them
i
might
think
her
a
fool
but
i
could
respect
her
but
you
know
she
does
care
for
a
soul
but
herself
i
do
think
it
is
that
but
she
in
great
trouble
i
sure
she
is
when
you
were
preaching
about
sorrow
last
sunday
i
saw
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
were
they
he
said
i
sorry
but
look
here
dear
i
do
think
this
sort
of
work
ought
to
be
used
as
a
soothing
syrup
or
as
a
for
loafers
who
do
know
what
else
to
do
if
people
are
doing
it
because
they
think
it
the
greatest
privilege
in
the
world
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
i
ca
see
that
they
do
much
good
i
think
you
too
hard
on
her
am
i
i
expect
i
am
i
know
i
fagged
to
death
she
gives
wilkins
pounds
on
the
sly
which
the
old
lady
been
transforming
into
gin
and
then
when
i
explain
the
circumstances
and
implore
her
to
leave
well
alone
she
talks
my
head
off
with
a
torrent
of
incoherent
statements
which
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
point
it
certainly
was
true
that
henrietta
did
not
do
much
good
and
no
one
was
more
aware
of
this
than
herself
she
stood
outside
the
community
and
looked
in
at
them
like
a
hungry
beggar
at
a
feast
how
she
envied
their
happiness
but
she
did
not
feel
that
she
was
or
ever
could
be
a
partaker
with
them
as
months
passed
on
she
drew
no
nearer
to
them
they
were
all
so
busy
so
strong
in
their
union
with
one
another
they
did
not
seem
to
have
time
to
stretch
out
a
friendly
hand
to
one
who
was
at
least
as
much
in
need
of
it
as
wilkins
the
lady
she
lived
with
found
her
trying
a
very
trying
person
was
the
phrase
that
went
the
round
about
her
always
criticizing
small
arrangements
about
the
meals
and
the
housekeeping
for
henrietta
could
not
at
first
reconcile
herself
to
having
no
authority
to
exert
and
this
jangling
was
not
a
good
preparation
for
sisterly
sympathy
towards
her
the
vicar
wife
might
have
become
friends
with
her
but
during
the
six
months
henrietta
was
in
the
parish
wharton
was
ill
and
hardly
able
to
see
anyone
besides
she
was
shy
and
the
only
time
that
henrietta
came
to
tea
they
never
succeeded
in
getting
beyond
a
comparison
of
foreign
hotels
henrietta
would
have
liked
to
confide
her
troubles
but
as
she
grew
older
she
had
become
a
great
deal
more
reserved
and
also
these
troubles
she
was
ashamed
to
speak
of
to
think
that
she
had
made
her
own
sister
ill
and
miserable
as
she
was
more
ill
and
more
miserable
she
could
not
forgive
herself
she
was
even
harder
on
herself
than
herbert
had
been
as
wharton
had
said
it
was
useless
engaging
in
this
arduous
work
when
her
heart
was
elsewhere
when
her
six
months
of
trial
came
to
an
end
it
was
clear
that
the
only
thing
for
her
was
to
go
no
one
could
pretend
they
were
sorry
and
as
everyone
imagined
she
was
glad
there
seemed
no
reason
to
disguise
their
feelings
they
would
have
been
surprised
if
they
had
known
her
thoughts
as
she
sat
at
the
evening
service
on
her
last
sunday
whatever
i
do
i
fail
what
is
the
use
of
my
living
why
was
i
born
she
said
to
wharton
in
her
farewell
interview
i
know
i
have
been
very
stupid
at
learning
what
was
to
be
done
and
i
have
not
been
willing
to
take
advice
now
i
look
back
i
see
the
mistakes
i
have
made
and
i
have
done
harm
instead
of
good
i
want
to
give
you
she
named
a
large
sum
considering
the
size
of
her
income
to
spend
as
you
think
right
i
hope
that
may
help
to
make
amends
i
am
very
sorry
he
heard
a
quiver
in
her
voice
and
the
dislike
and
irritation
he
had
felt
all
the
six
months
faded
away
this
is
much
too
generous
of
you
he
stammered
it
is
my
fault
all
my
fault
i
have
been
so
irritable
i
have
made
allowances
my
wife
tells
me
of
it
constantly
i
wish
you
would
forgive
me
and
give
us
another
chance
stay
six
months
longer
his
awkwardness
and
distress
almost
disarmed
her
but
she
had
felt
his
snubs
and
at
nearly
forty
she
was
not
going
to
be
encouraged
like
a
child
so
that
though
for
many
reasons
she
longed
to
stay
she
answered
thank
you
it
was
a
purely
temporary
arrangement
i
have
other
plans
as
she
walked
home
she
wondered
what
the
other
plans
were
when
in
doubt
go
abroad
she
went
abroad
again
for
three
months
her
companion
was
picked
up
from
nowhere
in
particular
an
odd
woman
like
herself
they
went
to
italy
neither
of
them
cared
in
the
smallest
degree
for
sculpture
architecture
painting
archæology
poetry
history
politics
scenery
languages
or
foreigners
these
last
henrietta
regarded
as
inferior
regard
natives
referring
to
them
always
as
those
wretches
like
most
women
she
loved
certain
aspects
in
her
garden
at
home
which
were
connected
with
incidents
in
her
life
there
was
a
path
bordered
by
roses
along
which
they
had
walked
when
evelyn
announced
her
engagement
and
a
special
old
reminded
her
of
the
night
her
mother
died
but
to
go
and
admire
what
baedeker
called
a
magnificent
was
no
sort
of
pleasure
to
her
however
she
and
miss
gurney
had
one
unending
amusement
which
italy
is
peculiarly
able
to
supply
they
could
make
short
visits
to
different
towns
and
fit
sights
into
their
days
as
one
fits
pieces
into
a
puzzle
henrietta
found
this
sport
most
satisfying
chapter
viii
just
as
they
were
getting
tired
of
tables
dinners
there
came
to
their
hotel
an
enthusiast
for
learning
it
was
before
the
days
of
women
colleges
they
were
established
but
frequented
only
by
pioneers
in
whose
ranks
no
henriettas
are
to
be
found
but
courses
of
lectures
were
so
ordinary
that
not
even
the
most
timid
could
look
askance
at
them
as
philanthropy
had
failed
and
no
one
could
pretend
that
art
could
be
a
resource
for
henrietta
her
career
of
sketches
and
two
had
been
phenomenally
short
invaluable
as
it
has
proved
itself
for
many
englishwomen
suffering
from
her
complaint
everything
pointed
to
study
as
the
next
solution
on
the
list
study
henrietta
had
not
read
a
book
which
required
any
mental
exertion
since
her
dozen
chapters
of
i
promessi
sposi
fifteen
years
ago
still
the
lectures
sounded
pleasant
to
her
they
were
a
novelty
they
were
she
could
not
think
of
anything
else
they
were
a
novelty
must
be
their
claim
to
distinction
she
and
the
travelling
friend
found
a
near
the
london
and
the
lodgings
both
looked
dismal
after
the
brightness
of
abroad
but
they
were
excited
at
the
prospect
of
establishing
themselves
on
their
own
account
it
was
enterprising
but
not
too
enterprising
henrietta
found
a
band
of
enthusiasts
at
the
lecture
it
seemed
her
fate
to
run
up
against
enthusiasm
she
could
not
share
young
ladies
ladies
even
old
ladies
all
listening
spellbound
at
least
if
not
absolutely
spellbound
spellbound
compared
to
henrietta
to
an
elderly
gentleman
discoursing
on
aristotle
for
most
of
them
aristotle
and
the
satisfaction
of
using
their
minds
were
sufficient
but
a
little
knot
of
women
in
the
front
with
hair
inclined
to
be
short
and
eyes
bursting
with
intelligence
used
learning
as
a
symbol
of
emancipation
lectures
were
their
vote
now
they
would
be
in
prison
henrietta
listened
for
five
minutes
then
suddenly
her
thoughts
darted
to
her
portmanteau
she
had
lost
the
key
at
dieppe
they
went
on
to
the
incivility
at
the
the
incivility
of
the
waiter
at
bâle
the
incivility
of
the
gardener
at
her
old
home
the
geranium
bed
in
the
garden
would
her
stepmother
attend
to
it
her
father
was
his
eyesight
really
failing
she
came
back
with
a
jump
to
find
that
the
lecture
had
moved
on
several
pages
she
listened
with
fair
success
for
another
five
minutes
then
her
mind
wandered
to
her
landlady
at
the
lodgings
was
she
perfectly
honest
did
her
expression
inspire
confidence
there
was
that
pearl
brooch
louie
had
given
her
it
was
louie
birthday
she
must
write
and
hear
also
how
tom
was
getting
on
in
this
his
second
term
at
school
she
must
send
him
a
hamper
she
had
settled
the
contents
of
the
hamper
when
she
found
that
someone
was
speaking
to
her
the
lecturer
was
asking
whether
she
felt
she
would
care
to
write
a
paper
he
hoped
as
many
ladies
as
possible
would
make
an
attempt
at
the
papers
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
and
interest
to
him
to
look
through
them
etc
on
the
way
back
she
found
miss
gurney
entranced
with
everything
she
seemed
to
have
picked
up
a
great
deal
more
than
henrietta
they
went
at
once
to
a
library
and
a
bookshop
to
get
what
they
had
been
advised
to
read
and
miss
gurney
bought
reams
of
paper
she
was
hard
at
work
the
whole
evening
henrietta
had
one
of
the
books
open
before
her
but
she
found
the
same
difficulty
in
concentrating
herself
that
she
had
done
at
the
lecture
miss
gurney
was
rapidly
filling
an
exercise
book
with
an
abstract
and
was
keeping
up
a
conversation
as
well
ah
was
the
piece
i
could
quite
understand
this
morning
yes
i
see
now
it
is
quite
clear
look
miss
symons
oh
i
shall
learn
greek
i
certainly
shall
as
he
said
it
will
make
it
twenty
times
more
interesting
what
were
they
all
so
excited
about
henrietta
had
never
cared
about
abstract
questions
and
she
could
not
see
that
there
was
any
object
in
discovering
what
the
ancient
greeks
thought
about
them
more
than
two
thousand
years
ago
the
evening
before
she
and
miss
gurney
had
had
an
interesting
conversation
on
the
weekly
averages
of
then
she
felt
comfortable
and
on
the
solid
earth
why
then
was
she
attending
lectures
on
aristotle
well
because
miss
gurney
had
a
friend
whose
cousin
had
married
the
lecturer
professor
amery
and
in
the
difficult
problem
of
choosing
a
subject
when
there
was
nothing
she
really
cared
to
know
about
this
was
as
good
a
reason
as
any
other
then
henrietta
remembered
how
she
and
emily
mence
years
ago
at
school
had
argued
the
whole
of
saturday
afternoon
about
mary
queen
of
scots
and
had
not
been
on
speaking
terms
the
following
day
because
emily
had
called
mary
frivolous
had
she
ever
really
been
that
queer
little
girl
still
she
was
anxious
to
give
the
lecturer
a
chance
most
anxious
for
she
had
already
had
to
suffer
from
minna
and
louie
sympathy
that
the
parish
work
was
a
failure
she
read
three
chapters
and
fell
asleep
in
the
middle
of
the
fourth
and
went
to
bed
half
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
next
morning
she
could
not
remember
a
word
of
what
she
had
read
but
for
two
dates
and
one
sentence
which
remained
in
her
head
even
now
in
the
latter
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
spite
of
an
unparalleled
advance
in
our
knowledge
of
the
natural
sciences
the
world
has
not
yet
produced
a
mind
which
can
equal
that
of
aristotle
in
its
astounding
versatility
and
profundity
of
learning
she
determined
to
persevere
but
was
it
her
subconscious
self
which
discovered
a
vast
arrear
of
letters
which
it
was
incumbent
on
her
to
answer
before
she
thought
of
anything
else
after
the
lecture
there
was
a
class
at
which
everyone
talked
even
the
dear
old
lady
next
to
henrietta
was
asking
a
quavering
question
yes
a
little
delicate
old
lady
had
energy
to
keep
the
current
of
the
lecture
in
her
head
she
said
that
aristotle
problem
whether
it
was
possible
for
slaves
to
have
ordinary
virtues
made
her
think
of
the
difference
in
the
christian
teaching
of
paul
epistles
had
any
of
the
other
greek
philosophers
been
more
humane
in
their
views
on
slavery
then
another
voice
struck
in
and
compared
the
ancient
idea
of
slavery
with
the
slave
code
of
the
united
states
the
voice
was
rather
strident
but
not
unpleasant
it
had
a
great
deal
to
say
and
for
some
minutes
seemed
likely
to
take
the
lecture
altogether
from
the
mouth
of
the
lecturer
henrietta
looked
in
its
direction
and
saw
a
small
elderly
lady
the
voice
and
the
face
both
set
her
thinking
and
by
the
end
of
the
lecture
she
was
certain
that
the
elderly
lady
was
miss
arundel
she
spoke
and
when
miss
arundel
had
recollected
who
she
was
it
took
a
little
time
henrietta
received
a
most
cordial
invitation
to
tea
miss
arundel
lived
with
a
niece
in
a
couple
of
rooms
quite
close
to
henrietta
marston
was
dead
and
miss
arundel
had
retired
from
the
school
with
just
enough
to
live
in
decent
comfort
so
now
after
teaching
all
my
life
i
am
giving
myself
the
treat
of
learning
and
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
am
enjoying
it
miss
symons
ada
and
i
both
like
professor
amery
so
much
and
she
prosed
on
about
the
lecture
and
the
books
she
was
reading
and
did
not
much
care
to
talk
over
the
old
times
which
were
still
very
dear
to
henrietta
it
amazed
henrietta
to
think
that
she
had
once
blushed
and
trembled
at
the
look
of
this
fussy
garrulous
little
governess
she
might
be
something
of
a
bore
but
there
was
no
question
of
her
happiness
her
interest
in
life
she
had
been
getting
up
at
six
the
last
three
mornings
that
she
might
finish
a
book
a
large
book
in
two
volumes
with
close
print
that
had
to
be
returned
to
the
library
henrietta
could
imagine
nothing
in
the
world
for
which
she
would
get
up
at
six
then
her
thoughts
went
like
lightning
to
the
morning
when
the
telegram
had
come
telling
of
little
madeline
death
the
wound
she
had
thought
healed
burst
out
afresh
for
a
few
seconds
she
felt
as
if
she
could
hardly
breathe
get
up
at
six
of
course
she
would
have
forfeited
her
sleep
with
joy
night
after
night
in
the
midst
of
envy
she
felt
something
like
contempt
for
miss
arundel
as
a
child
running
after
shadows
on
her
way
home
she
compared
her
past
with
miss
arundel
miss
arundel
could
look
back
on
busy
successful
happy
years
her
room
was
filled
with
tributes
from
old
pupils
they
were
continually
writing
to
her
and
coming
to
see
her
that
henrietta
knew
she
did
not
know
how
often
they
had
thanked
her
and
told
her
what
they
owed
her
then
she
envied
miss
arundel
powers
of
mind
after
forty
years
of
unceasing
and
exhausting
work
she
seemed
as
fresh
as
a
schoolgirl
and
far
more
capable
of
learning
while
henrietta
after
twenty
years
of
rest
had
not
merely
lost
all
the
qualities
she
had
had
as
a
child
but
had
gained
none
from
age
and
experience
to
take
their
place
the
realization
of
this
fact
startled
and
humiliated
her
if
her
powers
had
already
declined
at
forty
what
was
to
happen
in
the
twenty
years
of
life
that
she
might
reasonably
count
upon
as
still
before
her
she
thought
of
miss
arundel
words
etta
symons
is
a
girl
with
possibilities
i
shall
be
interested
to
see
how
she
will
turn
out
miss
arundel
had
long
forgotten
them
and
now
looked
on
henrietta
simply
as
a
of
the
lectures
but
she
said
to
her
niece
after
henrietta
had
been
to
tea
what
a
very
person
miss
symons
is
i
should
like
to
shake
her
henrietta
tried
her
hardest
to
work
at
the
lectures
to
recover
if
possible
what
she
had
lost
but
it
was
no
use
a
person
of
more
character
and
determination
might
have
succeeded
in
spite
of
the
long
years
of
mental
so
might
a
person
more
ready
to
take
advice
but
at
forty
as
i
have
said
she
felt
she
was
beyond
advice
so
she
would
not
notice
miss
gurney
hints
she
chose
to
despise
her
numberings
and
brackets
though
she
was
of
them
and
however
contemptible
these
aids
may
be
to
a
real
student
they
were
evidently
the
one
hope
for
henrietta
foggy
mind
she
began
a
paper
on
the
sly
and
with
much
sweat
of
brow
the
following
sentence
emerged
there
are
a
number
of
celebrated
writers
in
ancient
greece
and
among
the
number
we
may
notice
aristotle
who
wrote
a
number
of
celebrated
books
among
which
two
called
the
and
are
very
celebrated
he
also
wrote
many
other
works
but
none
are
so
celebrated
as
the
two
above
mentioned
she
had
not
written
a
paper
for
years
and
she
felt
as
helpless
as
if
she
were
trying
to
express
herself
in
french
her
essays
had
been
well
thought
of
at
school
as
she
was
floundering
along
up
came
miss
gurney
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
oh
miss
symons
i
should
have
a
margin
if
i
were
you
i
know
professor
amery
likes
a
margin
for
the
corrections
he
said
so
himself
oh
and
you
do
mind
my
saying
so
but
aristotle
did
not
write
a
republic
shall
i
just
scratch
that
out
that
was
plato
and
i
should
have
a
new
paragraph
there
and
i
always
find
i
do
know
if
you
will
that
it
makes
it
easier
to
underline
some
of
the
words
i
am
not
at
all
certain
that
i
am
going
to
write
a
paper
said
henrietta
i
just
wrote
a
few
notes
down
to
amuse
myself
oh
i
so
sorry
dear
well
if
you
should
think
of
doing
the
paper
you
must
read
this
article
it
such
a
help
it
really
puts
all
one
wants
to
say
oh
no
i
should
care
to
read
that
at
all
oh
do
let
me
put
it
here
and
then
you
can
look
at
it
no
thank
you
miss
gurney
went
out
and
henrietta
sat
at
her
paper
for
two
hours
and
a
half
it
was
so
bad
so
unintelligible
that
she
actually
cried
over
it
and
when
she
heard
miss
gurney
step
she
carried
it
off
to
her
bedroom
and
locked
the
door
miss
gurney
was
after
her
in
an
instant
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
paper
dear
can
i
be
of
any
help
she
did
finish
it
at
last
and
gave
it
to
amery
she
knew
it
was
bad
but
she
was
too
ignorant
to
know
quite
how
bad
professor
amery
with
the
extreme
courtesy
of
elderly
gentlemen
wrote
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
points
which
i
have
not
made
quite
clear
would
you
care
to
talk
them
over
with
me
after
the
class
but
this
offer
was
so
alarming
that
henrietta
cut
her
lectures
for
two
weeks
there
would
have
been
more
chance
for
her
if
only
she
could
have
become
in
the
least
interested
she
tried
the
french
revolution
next
term
for
a
change
but
liked
it
no
better
than
aristotle
intellectual
life
was
dead
and
buried
in
her
long
ago
what
would
have
really
suited
her
best
in
the
present
circumstances
would
have
been
shorthand
and
but
at
that
time
no
such
occupation
was
open
to
her
she
would
perhaps
have
jogged
on
indefinitely
at
the
lectures
if
miss
gurney
whose
great
interest
was
novelty
and
change
and
whose
abstracts
of
learned
books
had
lately
become
much
less
voluminous
had
not
jumped
at
a
suggestion
to
take
a
delicate
niece
abroad
and
proposed
that
henrietta
should
come
too
so
henrietta
consented
and
with
little
regret
they
gave
up
the
lodgings
and
said
to
learning
chapter
ix
henrietta
paid
her
father
a
visit
before
they
started
abroad
the
promise
of
the
first
days
was
amply
fulfilled
the
whole
house
was
happy
and
henrietta
was
touched
by
the
warmth
of
her
welcome
after
the
squalor
of
lodgings
home
was
pleasant
and
her
father
invitation
was
cordial
henrietta
why
do
you
stay
with
us
mildred
with
a
fond
look
at
his
wife
never
will
allow
your
room
to
be
used
it
always
ready
waiting
for
you
it
was
a
temptation
to
henrietta
but
she
refused
partly
from
pride
from
a
feeling
that
she
ought
not
to
disturb
the
present
comfort
but
also
because
it
was
getting
a
principle
with
her
as
apparently
with
many
englishwoman
that
she
must
always
be
going
abroad
yet
she
knew
that
miss
gurney
did
not
particularly
want
to
have
her
and
had
invited
her
more
from
laziness
than
from
anything
else
they
went
abroad
it
was
to
the
italian
lakes
and
a
life
of
sitting
in
the
sun
walking
up
and
down
promenades
short
drives
and
making
and
unmaking
of
desultory
friendships
began
they
grumbled
a
good
deal
to
third
parties
but
still
they
were
happy
enough
according
to
their
low
standard
of
happiness
as
they
were
abroad
for
an
indefinite
period
there
was
none
of
the
feeling
of
rush
which
they
had
enjoyed
so
much
before
but
sometimes
they
played
the
italian
game
and
had
days
called
coffee
train
arrive
at
destination
go
to
croce
for
coffee
visit
churches
of
santa
maria
and
san
giovanni
and
museum
luncheon
drive
to
roman
remains
back
to
croce
for
tea
separate
for
shopping
and
meet
at
station
for
train
back
for
special
kept
for
them
in
the
à
henrietta
would
settle
it
all
with
baedeker
and
the
railway
guide
the
night
before
and
if
she
had
felt
apprehension
at
her
failing
powers
in
history
her
grasp
of
this
kind
of
day
could
not
have
been
bettered
everything
was
seen
and
everything
was
timed
and
the
only
person
who
might
have
something
to
complain
of
was
the
delicate
niece
who
went
through
her
treat
too
exhausted
to
open
her
mouth
counting
the
hours
when
she
might
go
to
her
bed
in
peace
at
last
miss
gurney
and
the
niece
decided
to
return
to
england
henrietta
found
some
americans
who
wanted
to
stay
at
montreux
and
they
asked
her
to
join
them
after
montreux
came
chamounix
and
in
the
autumn
miss
gurney
niece
came
out
again
and
she
and
henrietta
stayed
at
como
and
then
at
mentone
till
april
then
came
switzerland
again
then
henrietta
went
to
england
for
a
round
of
visits
and
by
the
end
of
them
she
was
longing
to
be
back
abroad
she
said
that
england
was
depressing
and
gave
her
rheumatism
and
that
she
in
the
best
of
health
and
prime
of
life
could
not
face
an
english
winter
the
fact
was
she
did
not
care
for
the
sharing
of
other
people
lives
which
is
expected
from
a
visitor
and
her
long
sojourn
in
hotels
with
no
one
but
herself
to
consider
had
made
her
less
easy
to
live
with
so
without
exactly
knowing
how
she
drifted
into
spending
almost
all
her
time
abroad
every
other
year
she
came
back
for
visits
in
the
summer
but
in
the
spring
autumn
and
winter
she
wandered
from
one
cheap
to
another
in
italy
france
germany
belgium
or
switzerland
if
she
had
led
a
life
as
keeper
of
her
father
house
she
now
learnt
the
art
of
getting
through
a
day
in
which
she
did
absolutely
nothing
when
she
became
accustomed
to
it
the
very
smallest
service
required
of
her
was
regarded
as
a
cross
sometimes
a
relation
would
commission
her
to
buy
something
abroad
and
then
the
à
would
resound
with
wails
because
she
must
go
round
the
corner
select
an
article
and
give
orders
to
the
shopman
to
despatch
it
to
england
the
friends
who
asked
her
to
engage
rooms
for
them
at
an
hotel
had
cause
to
rue
their
request
they
never
heard
the
end
of
it
many
lonely
women
receive
great
solace
from
their
church
and
give
solace
in
return
where
would
the
church
and
the
poor
be
without
them
but
henrietta
was
never
long
enough
in
her
caravanserais
to
become
attached
to
the
services
of
the
chaplains
in
the
à
and
she
soon
gave
up
churchgoing
at
first
she
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
inventing
reasons
to
keep
her
conscience
quiet
such
as
that
it
had
rained
in
the
night
and
therefore
might
rain
again
or
that
she
did
not
approve
of
chanting
amen
but
later
she
did
not
see
why
there
should
be
a
reason
and
left
her
conscious
to
its
remorse
bad
health
is
another
resource
for
unoccupied
women
and
it
certainly
occurred
to
her
as
an
occupation
but
she
realized
that
it
and
roving
can
not
be
combined
and
of
the
two
she
preferred
roving
her
chief
pastime
was
to
skim
through
novels
any
novels
that
could
be
found
costume
novels
of
english
history
by
preference
this
was
how
her
bent
for
learning
satisfied
itself
she
never
remembered
the
author
or
title
or
anything
of
what
she
read
but
at
the
same
time
she
was
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
she
must
always
have
something
new
and
would
constantly
accuse
her
friends
or
the
library
of
deceiving
her
with
books
she
had
read
before
if
you
ca
remember
what
does
it
matter
her
dreadfully
reasonable
nieces
would
exclaim
not
realizing
that
her
sole
interest
in
the
novels
was
the
collector
interest
of
seeing
how
many
new
ones
she
could
find
a
second
pastime
was
her
patience
that
bond
which
knits
together
our
occidental
civilization
she
was
always
learning
new
patiences
and
always
mixing
them
up
with
one
another
this
was
another
source
of
annoyance
to
efficient
nieces
but
that
is
not
demon
aunt
etta
they
would
explain
playing
patience
severely
from
a
sense
of
duty
she
cheated
so
persistently
that
there
was
no
room
for
skill
i
conceive
why
you
play
they
said
crossly
but
the
reason
was
perfectly
clear
it
stared
one
in
the
face
during
the
patience
the
clock
had
moved
from
ten
minutes
past
eight
to
minutes
to
ten
henrietta
also
killed
time
now
and
then
with
sights
not
churches
or
old
pictures
of
course
she
never
went
near
masterpieces
now
she
had
ample
leisure
for
seeing
them
but
easter
services
royal
birthday
processions
or
battles
of
flowers
as
she
seldom
broke
her
routine
of
idleness
these
occasions
excited
her
not
with
pleasurable
anticipation
but
with
a
nervous
fluster
that
she
might
somehow
miss
something
and
the
concierge
the
porter
madame
and
the
would
all
be
flying
about
the
hotel
half
an
hour
before
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
start
sent
on
some
perfectly
useless
errand
connected
with
her
outing
if
it
rained
if
something
went
wrong
how
she
grumbled
and
when
she
did
see
her
show
it
gave
her
very
little
pleasure
she
had
not
in
the
least
a
child
mind
she
was
not
pleased
by
small
events
yet
she
grasped
desperately
after
them
with
an
absurd
hazy
idea
that
she
was
defrauded
of
her
rights
if
she
did
not
see
them
another
interest
was
an
enormous
collection
of
photographs
of
places
which
she
had
not
cared
for
at
the
time
and
could
not
in
the
least
remember
another
her
of
pensions
and
hotels
to
which
she
was
always
adding
new
volumes
above
all
grumbling
favourite
subjects
were
her
kettle
and
her
methylated
spirits
whether
the
hotel
would
allow
her
to
take
up
milk
and
sugar
from
breakfast
whether
the
chambermaid
abstracted
the
biscuits
she
brought
from
dessert
overnight
everyone
who
came
in
contact
with
miss
symons
found
they
were
made
to
listen
to
an
endless
story
of
a
certain
elise
who
had
stolen
the
biscuits
and
substituted
other
ones
that
were
quite
four
days
old
and
of
elise
brazen
behaviour
when
charged
with
the
offence
her
standard
of
comfort
at
a
hotel
was
so
impossible
that
she
became
an
object
of
terror
and
dislike
to
the
waiters
and
chambermaids
she
was
punctual
in
payment
but
very
grasping
and
wrung
many
concessions
from
the
hotels
by
a
persistence
which
no
men
and
few
women
would
have
had
the
courage
to
display
she
was
always
seeking
the
ideal
hotel
and
for
this
reason
she
was
always
wandering
and
never
was
long
enough
in
one
place
to
strike
any
roots
and
create
a
feeling
of
home
this
life
corroded
her
character
she
became
more
and
nagging
always
up
in
arms
scenting
out
liberties
and
thinking
she
was
taken
advantage
of
she
was
not
a
character
which
does
well
by
itself
and
under
a
domineering
manner
she
concealed
her
weakness
vacillation
and
timidity
she
was
divorced
from
every
duty
every
responsibility
every
natural
tie
with
no
outlet
for
her
interest
or
her
sympathy
it
seems
inconceivable
that
she
should
willingly
have
led
such
an
existence
she
was
however
much
more
satisfied
with
herself
and
with
things
in
general
than
she
had
formerly
been
she
did
not
have
stormy
repentances
or
outbursts
against
her
lot
she
no
longer
desired
what
was
unattainable
if
she
did
not
have
a
particularly
high
standard
of
happiness
or
of
character
neither
in
her
opinion
had
the
rest
of
the
world
not
that
she
thought
much
of
these
things
and
had
caused
her
much
misery
in
early
life
and
she
shrank
from
opening
all
those
wounds
again
she
faced
facts
as
little
as
she
could
she
lived
from
day
to
day
and
her
inner
self
was
really
very
much
what
her
outer
self
seemed
absorbed
in
the
very
small
round
of
events
which
concerned
her
the
days
passed
the
months
passed
the
years
passed
she
saw
them
go
unregretted
and
when
they
were
gone
she
did
not
remember
them
nothing
had
happened
in
them
bad
or
good
to
mark
their
course
what
a
piece
of
work
is
a
man
how
noble
in
reason
how
infinite
in
faculty
in
form
in
moving
how
express
and
admirable
in
action
how
like
an
angel
in
apprehension
how
like
a
god
the
beauty
of
the
world
the
paragon
of
animals
chapter
x
it
has
been
shown
that
henrietta
had
not
much
power
of
attracting
affection
to
herself
and
she
had
long
ceased
to
desire
it
she
was
now
brought
into
contact
with
numbers
of
different
people
and
as
travelling
acquaintances
she
liked
them
but
when
they
parted
she
did
not
want
to
see
them
again
there
was
however
an
exception
to
this
rule
henrietta
found
many
companions
in
misfortune
expatriated
either
from
health
pleasure
or
poverty
an
intelligent
foreigner
has
inquired
whether
there
are
any
single
elderly
ladies
left
in
england
so
innumerable
are
the
hosts
abroad
some
like
her
had
worn
their
personalities
so
thin
that
it
seemed
likely
they
would
eventually
become
shadows
with
no
character
left
others
were
nice
and
cheerful
and
made
little
encampments
in
the
wilderness
so
that
the
unfortunates
might
gather
round
them
and
almost
feel
they
had
got
a
home
it
was
in
the
room
of
a
nice
one
that
henrietta
met
a
colonel
there
are
fewer
occupationless
englishmen
abroad
but
there
is
a
fair
supply
officers
consumptives
and
mysterious
creatures
who
have
no
good
reason
for
being
there
they
were
a
strange
medley
for
henrietta
to
associate
with
people
whom
in
her
palmy
days
as
mistress
of
her
father
house
she
would
have
thought
unspeakable
she
had
none
of
this
generation
tolerance
and
love
of
new
sensations
to
attract
her
to
unsatisfactory
people
she
only
really
liked
conventional
respectability
this
colonel
was
not
respectable
he
was
not
a
colonel
in
the
english
army
and
never
would
say
much
about
himself
he
was
very
pleasant
and
polite
and
henrietta
as
she
walked
back
to
table
felt
she
had
spent
a
livelier
afternoon
than
usual
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
and
looking
back
six
weeks
later
she
was
astonished
to
find
how
often
they
had
met
shortly
after
the
lady
in
whose
room
henrietta
had
first
seen
him
asked
her
to
tea
she
did
not
seem
quite
so
as
usual
and
at
last
began
you
know
miss
symons
my
cousin
colonel
hilton
is
rather
a
peculiar
man
i
known
him
all
my
life
and
i
do
think
there
is
any
harm
in
him
but
money
is
his
difficulty
he
ought
to
be
well
off
but
it
always
seems
to
slip
through
his
fingers
henrietta
realized
that
this
was
a
warning
at
the
end
of
the
season
he
proposed
and
she
accepted
him
she
knew
he
proposed
for
her
money
and
she
knew
that
besides
being
mercenary
he
was
a
poor
creature
in
every
way
most
people
could
not
have
borne
long
with
his
society
but
she
unaccustomed
to
companionship
felt
that
he
sufficed
her
she
did
not
think
much
of
the
future
when
she
did
she
realized
that
it
was
hardly
possible
they
could
marry
but
meanwhile
it
was
something
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
own
how
much
to
have
someone
call
her
dear
once
he
attained
to
dearest
but
he
was
evidently
frightened
at
his
temerity
and
did
not
repeat
the
experiment
she
announced
the
engagement
and
a
letter
from
minna
came
flying
to
the
riviera
saying
that
all
sorts
of
terrible
things
were
known
about
the
colonel
and
imploring
henrietta
to
desist
she
did
not
desist
but
very
soon
the
colonel
did
having
discovered
that
her
fortune
was
not
so
large
as
he
had
been
given
to
suppose
there
was
a
solid
something
it
is
true
but
for
henrietta
quite
and
decidedly
cross
she
imagined
she
was
never
cross
with
him
he
felt
he
must
have
a
very
considerable
something
he
wrote
a
letter
breaking
off
the
engagement
and
left
the
riviera
abruptly
having
made
a
good
thing
out
of
his
season
henrietta
had
lent
him
said
given
others
said
over
three
hundred
pounds
and
now
we
shall
have
a
terrible
piece
of
work
said
minna
to
louie
you
know
what
henrietta
always
is
what
she
was
about
that
other
affair
with
a
man
years
ago
and
again
when
evelyn
little
girl
died
she
gets
so
excited
and
overwrought
but
henrietta
quite
upset
their
expectations
this
which
most
people
might
have
thought
the
most
serious
misfortune
which
had
befallen
her
affected
her
very
little
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
saying
well
when
all
said
and
done
i
had
my
offer
like
everyone
else
she
was
grateful
for
the
dears
too
she
did
not
realize
that
there
had
been
absolutely
nothing
behind
them
she
answered
the
colonel
speedy
application
for
more
money
and
continued
to
send
him
supplies
from
time
to
time
evelyn
and
herbert
had
returned
to
england
and
had
settled
on
the
south
coast
two
boys
had
been
born
in
canada
and
had
grown
and
prospered
henrietta
stayed
with
evelyn
for
a
fortnight
whenever
she
was
back
in
england
but
somehow
the
visits
were
not
the
pleasure
they
should
have
been
evelyn
was
still
delicate
and
herbert
had
begged
henrietta
when
she
saw
her
to
make
no
allusion
to
their
loss
evelyn
was
delighted
at
showing
her
boys
and
henrietta
was
pleased
for
her
that
she
should
have
them
but
to
her
they
did
not
in
the
least
take
the
place
of
the
dead
they
were
not
hers
she
was
almost
indignant
with
evelyn
for
caring
for
them
so
much
and
accused
her
in
her
heart
of
forgetfulness
this
made
her
irritable
which
herbert
resented
and
then
evelyn
was
nervous
because
herbert
and
henrietta
did
not
get
on
well
together
evelyn
letters
to
her
were
very
affectionate
the
only
real
pleasure
in
any
reasonable
sense
of
the
word
in
henrietta
life
sometimes
evelyn
and
her
husband
and
boys
came
out
to
stay
with
henrietta
the
visits
were
not
occasions
of
much
happiness
and
a
certain
day
remained
for
years
as
a
mild
nightmare
in
evelyn
memory
they
were
all
in
milan
one
spring
when
the
patron
of
the
hotel
announced
that
his
lady
cousin
who
lived
at
some
little
country
town
had
heard
from
her
friend
a
priest
in
that
same
little
town
that
on
tuesday
there
was
to
be
a
special
festa
in
connection
with
a
local
saint
would
the
english
ladies
and
gentlemen
care
to
go
the
patron
himself
had
the
contempt
of
an
enlightened
man
for
saints
and
festas
but
he
knew
the
curious
attraction
which
such
childishness
possesses
for
the
english
tourist
all
was
arranged
the
railway
company
had
never
intended
that
the
little
town
should
be
reached
from
milan
but
with
an
early
start
and
much
changing
of
trains
it
was
possible
to
accomplish
the
journey
in
two
hours
and
a
half
they
arrived
there
was
no
surprise
among
the
hotel
omnibuses
at
their
appearance
for
the
italians
have
found
that
the
english
will
turn
up
everywhere
but
they
were
certainly
the
only
representatives
of
their
nation
they
reached
the
church
where
the
festa
was
to
take
place
it
was
sleeping
peacefully
brooded
over
by
a
delicious
sweet
smell
of
dirt
and
stale
incense
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
but
as
the
party
marched
indignantly
up
and
down
the
aisles
another
smell
comes
to
join
the
incense
garlic
a
merry
little
priest
appears
it
is
the
friend
of
the
lady
cousin
he
knew
no
english
but
yis
yis
they
little
italian
but
the
essentials
for
travel
troppo
bello
antiquo
at
the
word
festa
he
shook
his
head
very
sadly
and
he
said
domani
so
many
times
that
with
the
help
of
henrietta
little
they
found
it
must
mean
they
had
come
the
wrong
day
he
was
very
much
distressed
about
it
to
make
up
if
possible
for
the
disappointment
he
showed
them
all
over
the
church
and
sacristy
he
did
not
miss
one
memorial
tablet
not
one
disappearing
fresco
and
knowing
the
taste
of
the
english
he
said
as
each
new
item
was
displayed
molto
antiquo
he
was
so
much
attracted
by
evelyn
charming
beauty
and
her
sweet
english
voice
that
when
santa
barbara
was
exhausted
he
could
not
resist
showing
them
what
he
cared
for
much
more
his
own
little
mission
church
with
its
brilliant
images
and
artificial
wreaths
the
boys
fifteen
and
seventeen
had
had
enough
of
churches
after
two
days
at
milan
and
evelyn
could
hear
from
conscientious
stumping
tread
that
he
was
examining
the
church
because
a
soldier
must
always
do
his
duty
at
length
it
was
over
they
came
out
into
the
sunshine
and
the
big
town
clock
struck
a
quarter
to
eleven
their
train
home
left
at
the
two
churches
had
only
used
up
an
hour
and
a
quarter
now
dearest
said
herbert
firmly
i
dare
say
you
and
etta
will
like
a
little
rest
suppose
i
and
the
boys
get
a
walk
in
the
country
and
do
wait
lunch
for
us
you
know
i
dare
say
we
can
get
something
at
one
of
those
little
wine
places
one
sees
about
they
managed
to
construct
a
sentence
for
the
priest
who
was
standing
nodding
by
them
are
there
any
pretty
walks
in
the
neighbourhood
smiling
genially
he
pointed
to
an
answer
which
the
translated
the
landscape
presents
a
grandiose
panorama
evelyn
gave
the
priest
a
contribution
to
his
mission
church
he
was
overwhelmed
with
surprise
and
pleasure
at
this
good
action
on
the
part
of
a
heretic
it
added
to
his
pleasure
that
she
was
such
a
beautiful
heretic
and
when
as
they
said
evelyn
wished
that
they
might
meet
again
he
replied
with
his
face
all
over
smiles
i
hope
perhaps
in
paradise
he
could
not
speak
with
absolute
certainty
something
in
the
way
he
said
it
brought
tears
to
evelyn
eyes
and
henrietta
who
was
looking
on
and
listening
thought
with
a
little
envy
that
none
of
the
many
priests
or
pastors
few
even
of
the
laity
she
had
encountered
in
her
wanderings
had
ever
hoped
to
meet
again
either
in
heaven
or
on
earth
after
many
affectionate
bows
he
said
the
sisters
were
scarcely
half
an
hour
buying
picture
postcards
there
had
been
nothing
else
to
do
so
they
had
bought
more
picture
postcards
than
it
seemed
possible
could
be
bought
when
rain
came
on
not
gentle
english
rain
but
the
fierce
cataracts
of
italy
let
loose
for
the
rest
of
the
day
back
came
herbert
and
the
boys
who
had
somehow
missed
the
grandiose
panorama
it
had
in
fact
been
created
entirely
out
of
politeness
by
the
priest
after
lunch
which
they
prolonged
to
its
farthest
limit
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
the
salon
a
small
room
with
its
window
darkened
by
the
verandah
outside
madame
brought
in
yesterday
and
they
found
an
illustrated
catalogue
of
hotels
in
dresden
oh
that
three
hours
and
a
half
the
boys
and
herbert
would
have
been
content
to
sit
with
their
shoulders
hutched
up
staring
at
their
boots
going
every
quarter
of
an
hour
to
the
to
see
if
it
were
raining
as
hard
there
as
it
was
out
of
the
salon
window
and
evelyn
only
wanted
to
be
left
in
silence
with
her
headache
but
henrietta
would
tease
the
boys
whatever
they
did
do
or
whatever
they
did
not
do
seemed
an
occasion
for
criticism
evelyn
to
divert
attention
burst
into
long
reminiscences
of
the
days
at
willstead
henrietta
combated
each
statement
with
a
kind
of
sneer
as
though
whatever
evelyn
said
was
bound
to
be
worthless
evelyn
saw
herbert
who
always
treated
her
as
if
she
were
a
wonderful
queen
casting
black
looks
at
henrietta
at
last
his
anger
came
out
i
do
know
why
it
seems
impossible
for
you
to
talk
to
evelyn
with
ordinary
civility
henrietta
my
dearest
boy
said
evelyn
going
and
patting
herbert
shoulder
etty
and
i
do
care
about
ordinary
civility
we
love
having
our
little
spars
together
sisters
do
bother
to
be
as
polite
as
men
are
to
one
another
life
would
be
much
too
much
of
a
burden
she
gave
henrietta
hand
a
squeeze
as
she
went
back
to
her
seat
but
after
this
henrietta
would
hardly
talk
at
all
and
the
reminiscences
became
a
monologue
from
evelyn
at
last
at
long
last
the
train
came
and
henrietta
forgot
her
disappointment
in
sleep
the
happy
day
she
had
looked
forward
to
and
planned
and
paid
for
was
over
louie
and
her
colonel
did
not
thrive
better
as
the
years
went
on
money
never
seemed
able
to
stay
with
them
henrietta
helped
them
long
after
everyone
else
had
become
tired
of
them
she
did
not
expect
gratitude
nor
did
she
get
it
in
spite
of
her
dependence
louie
managed
to
convey
the
impression
of
henrietta
inferiority
and
the
children
spoke
of
her
as
a
butt
oh
it
aunt
etta
year
it
really
is
rather
a
fag
to
think
we
shall
have
her
for
three
weeks
ethel
it
your
turn
to
take
her
in
tow
i
had
her
all
last
time
poor
etta
said
minna
she
is
such
an
interminable
talker
it
does
worry
arthur
so
she
means
very
well
we
all
know
that
minna
children
were
very
much
of
the
twentieth
century
and
were
not
going
to
bear
with
a
dull
old
maid
merely
because
she
was
their
aunt
and
had
been
kind
to
them
as
one
of
them
expressed
it
never
put
yourself
out
for
a
relation
however
distant
that
an
axiom
little
as
the
younger
generation
thought
of
her
she
thought
something
of
them
and
the
second
week
in
december
when
she
chose
her
christmas
presents
for
all
her
nieces
and
nephews
was
the
pleasantest
week
in
the
year
to
her
chapter
xi
henrietta
had
been
fourteen
years
abroad
when
she
came
to
pay
her
biennial
visit
to
evelyn
who
do
you
think
has
come
to
live
here
henrietta
said
evelyn
as
they
sat
talking
the
first
evening
ellen
ellen
yes
our
dear
old
ellen
plumtree
she
a
widow
now
her
eldest
son
is
working
here
and
she
is
living
with
him
and
his
wife
i
went
to
see
her
last
week
and
she
was
so
delighted
to
talk
over
old
times
and
when
she
heard
you
were
coming
she
was
so
excited
you
were
always
her
favourite
a
few
days
afterwards
they
went
to
find
ellen
a
very
hale
old
lady
in
spite
of
having
brought
up
a
large
family
of
her
own
she
had
the
clearest
remembrance
of
apparently
every
incident
of
the
childhood
of
you
two
young
ladies
so
she
still
called
them
as
though
she
had
never
had
any
other
interest
in
life
oh
and
miss
etta
she
said
what
a
sight
you
did
think
of
miss
evie
i
never
knew
a
child
take
so
to
anyone
before
quite
a
little
mother
i
often
used
to
say
to
sarah
do
you
remember
sarah
she
died
only
last
year
she
suffered
dreadful
with
her
heart
do
you
remember
how
you
always
would
go
to
put
your
hand
into
the
water
before
i
gave
miss
evie
her
bath
because
you
wanted
to
be
sure
it
was
too
hot
every
evening
you
did
it
and
one
day
you
were
out
late
and
miss
evie
was
in
bed
before
you
came
in
and
you
cried
because
you
been
able
to
do
it
neither
sister
found
it
easy
to
speak
but
ellen
wanted
very
little
encouragement
sometimes
as
a
great
treat
when
you
was
a
little
older
miss
evie
i
let
you
sleep
in
miss
etty
bed
and
she
used
to
lay
and
cuddle
you
so
pretty
and
the
canary
miss
etta
do
you
remember
that
when
miss
evie
dickie
died
you
went
all
the
way
to
willstead
by
yourself
and
bought
a
new
canary
so
that
she
might
never
know
her
dickie
died
your
mamma
was
very
angry
with
you
i
remember
but
there
was
nothing
you
would
do
for
miss
evie
the
sisters
walked
back
in
silence
their
hearts
were
too
full
for
speech
there
was
no
time
for
private
conversation
till
night
when
evelyn
came
into
henrietta
room
and
flung
her
arms
round
her
darling
darling
etta
she
said
i
could
hardly
bear
it
when
ellen
was
talking
to
think
of
all
that
you
were
to
me
all
that
you
did
for
me
and
that
i
should
have
forgotten
it
oh
how
is
it
that
we
got
apart
i
do
know
said
henrietta
i
do
think
there
is
anything
much
to
like
in
me
no
one
does
care
for
me
i
think
if
no
one
likes
one
one
does
deserve
to
be
liked
oh
nothing
in
this
life
goes
by
deserts
people
love
you
and
they
quite
right
you
ought
to
be
loved
you
did
care
for
me
once
though
herbert
wrote
you
know
when
we
lost
good
cry
with
you
will
be
more
comfort
to
evelyn
than
anything
else
even
then
in
the
middle
of
it
all
it
made
me
happy
oh
etta
what
you
were
to
me
then
henrietta
took
evelyn
hand
and
squeezed
it
convulsively
when
she
could
speak
she
said
evelyn
do
you
ever
think
of
our
children
think
of
them
of
course
i
do
do
you
etta
i
used
to
but
i
tried
not
to
it
was
too
bitter
the
children
were
what
i
lived
for
and
i
do
think
of
them
often
now
it
past
and
gone
oh
i
could
live
if
i
did
i
do
think
it
is
bitter
now
these
dear
boys
they
not
quite
the
same
to
me
as
the
ones
that
were
taken
i
thought
you
forgotten
them
i
thought
you
had
etta
and
i
could
help
feeling
it
herbert
asked
me
never
to
speak
about
them
to
you
dear
herbert
he
is
so
good
i
ca
tell
you
how
good
he
is
to
me
but
he
never
will
mention
them
first
of
all
i
was
so
ill
i
could
stand
talking
of
them
but
now
i
can
and
i
do
long
for
it
he
does
forget
them
i
know
but
i
think
men
live
more
in
the
present
than
we
do
and
he
has
his
work
which
absorbs
him
very
much
and
it
is
quite
the
same
for
a
man
and
then
they
were
so
delicate
particularly
madeline
that
i
was
wrapped
up
in
them
all
their
lives
and
they
were
so
small
he
could
see
much
of
them
do
you
feel
that
you
could
tell
me
about
them
yes
i
should
like
to
they
talked
far
into
the
night
herbert
was
away
so
that
there
was
no
one
to
stop
them
and
when
at
last
the
dawn
drove
them
to
bed
evelyn
said
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
good
you
done
me
i
seem
to
have
been
living
for
this
for
fifteen
years
they
neither
of
them
slept
at
all
that
night
both
were
full
of
remorse
but
henrietta
was
the
bitterest
the
life
which
had
seemed
to
do
quite
well
enough
all
these
years
suddenly
appeared
to
her
as
it
was
she
contrasted
her
present
self
with
the
little
girl
ellen
had
known
like
jane
eyre
she
drew
her
own
picture
faithfully
without
softening
one
defect
she
omitted
no
hard
line
smoothed
away
no
displeasing
irregularity
she
had
squabbled
that
very
afternoon
if
it
is
possible
to
squabble
when
only
one
party
does
the
squabbling
all
the
way
down
to
ellen
about
various
quite
unimportant
dates
in
william
life
the
incident
was
almost
as
much
a
part
of
her
day
routine
as
eating
her
breakfast
now
it
seemed
to
her
a
manifestation
of
the
degradation
into
which
she
had
fallen
the
power
and
vividness
of
her
memory
magnified
ten
times
by
the
mysterious
agency
of
midnight
brought
back
the
words
of
advice
of
emily
mence
of
minna
and
of
her
aunt
just
as
if
they
had
been
spoken
last
week
she
had
entirely
forgotten
them
for
years
now
they
kept
rushing
through
her
head
hour
after
hour
before
breakfast
evelyn
came
into
her
room
her
eyes
shining
with
agitation
and
looking
so
flushed
that
henrietta
saw
what
need
there
had
been
for
herbert
caution
etty
she
said
i
been
thinking
all
night
i
ca
bear
your
living
in
this
horrible
way
no
home
away
by
yourself
so
that
we
see
nothing
of
you
come
and
live
here
live
with
us
we
sha
interfere
with
you
you
shall
come
and
go
as
you
like
or
live
in
the
village
there
is
a
dear
little
house
just
made
for
you
only
come
and
be
near
us
henrietta
was
sorely
tempted
it
was
a
great
sacrifice
to
say
no
but
she
knew
that
herbert
only
tolerated
her
for
evelyn
sake
and
that
the
boys
rather
spoilt
and
found
her
a
nuisance
she
knew
also
that
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
be
pleasant
and
if
she
came
it
would
not
be
for
evelyn
happiness
so
she
refused
and
even
in
her
fervour
of
love
for
henrietta
evelyn
could
not
help
realizing
it
was
best
that
she
should
at
the
same
time
that
talk
was
a
in
henrietta
life
she
never
felt
after
it
that
she
was
completely
unwanted
although
she
would
not
live
with
evelyn
she
thought
she
might
justifiably
come
and
be
much
nearer
her
and
she
gave
up
the
roving
life
and
returned
to
england
it
had
in
fact
satisfied
her
only
because
she
had
felt
so
that
she
became
insignificant
even
to
herself
where
should
she
live
she
knew
that
every
place
where
she
had
relations
would
not
do
but
this
only
ruled
out
four
of
the
towns
of
the
united
kingdom
it
must
be
a
town
on
that
point
she
was
clear
as
she
cared
for
none
of
the
special
advantages
of
a
town
its
more
lively
society
its
greater
opportunities
for
entertainment
and
intellectual
interests
she
was
particularly
insistent
that
she
could
not
do
without
them
what
she
wanted
was
a
house
with
room
for
herself
two
maids
and
a
couple
of
visitors
such
a
house
is
to
be
found
in
tens
and
hundreds
everywhere
she
went
round
and
round
england
in
a
fruitless
search
as
a
the
whole
arrangement
of
her
life
had
been
taken
out
of
her
hands
even
her
clothes
had
been
settled
for
her
by
one
of
those
octopus
london
firms
which
like
to
reduce
their
customers
to
dummies
and
her
transit
from
hotel
to
hotel
and
from
english
visits
back
to
hotels
had
become
a
mere
automatic
process
she
had
not
made
a
decision
for
so
many
years
that
though
her
nieces
and
nephews
were
witty
over
her
vacillation
and
declared
that
she
enjoyed
being
a
nuisance
it
was
a
fact
that
she
was
trying
her
best
to
be
sensible
and
competent
she
with
no
no
protector
must
determine
which
was
most
important
gravel
soil
or
southern
aspect
she
felt
as
she
had
felt
years
ago
when
she
wrote
her
paper
for
professor
amery
only
ten
times
more
bewildered
almost
delirious
of
course
her
nieces
constantly
talked
her
over
shaking
their
heads
and
saying
if
only
aunt
etta
would
let
us
but
however
weak
she
was
she
was
firm
in
this
she
would
be
helped
the
outward
sign
of
her
bewilderment
was
extreme
crossness
particularly
to
evelyn
who
was
allowed
to
accompany
her
in
her
search
and
to
hear
her
remarks
without
making
any
suggestions
i
will
thank
you
to
let
me
decide
about
my
own
house
by
myself
they
had
examined
nine
houses
that
day
and
were
both
almost
weeping
with
exhaustion
evelyn
could
not
help
feeling
exasperated
but
when
etta
stumbled
the
moment
after
from
sheer
nervousness
and
evelyn
caught
hold
of
her
hand
she
realized
from
its
hot
trembling
grasp
how
hard
it
is
to
come
back
to
life
again
henrietta
would
probably
never
have
found
the
right
spot
if
a
timely
attack
of
rheumatism
had
not
persuaded
her
to
fix
on
bath
when
she
had
settled
into
her
house
at
last
she
hated
it
she
dismissed
five
servants
in
two
months
she
was
so
dull
no
one
called
bath
was
so
cold
if
only
she
could
let
her
house
and
go
abroad
for
the
winter
happily
no
suitable
tenant
appeared
and
gradually
bath
grew
into
a
habit
and
she
became
resigned
but
it
was
long
very
long
before
she
would
own
that
she
liked
it
chapter
xii
and
now
a
happier
and
more
useful
course
of
life
began
henrietta
had
just
enough
rheumatism
to
take
a
course
of
waters
sometimes
she
found
a
doctor
who
had
a
great
for
elderly
ladies
he
knew
when
to
bully
them
when
to
flatter
them
and
when
to
neglect
them
he
and
the
waters
made
a
centre
round
which
the
rest
of
her
interests
might
group
themselves
church
she
found
a
vicar
with
nothing
of
enthusiasm
and
loftiness
of
aim
but
with
a
greater
realization
of
people
capacities
he
too
had
made
a
study
of
elderly
ladies
who
are
always
such
an
important
branch
of
congregations
he
could
see
that
what
miss
symons
was
in
his
touchy
incompetent
and
snappish
she
would
be
in
any
work
she
did
in
the
parish
but
he
was
also
made
to
see
her
extreme
generosity
of
which
she
herself
was
entirely
unconscious
he
liked
and
was
touched
by
her
humility
oh
no
trouble
about
asking
me
vaughan
nobody
will
want
to
talk
to
a
dull
person
like
me
get
some
nice
young
men
for
the
girls
if
you
can
no
i
ca
have
that
pretty
miss
allan
helping
at
my
stall
i
can
get
along
very
well
by
myself
i
shall
bring
annie
we
can
manage
together
the
poor
people
of
course
did
not
like
her
for
as
she
grew
older
she
was
more
convinced
than
ever
that
the
lower
orders
must
be
constantly
reproved
but
poor
people
are
very
magnanimous
and
they
were
sure
of
a
good
many
presents
she
was
also
for
ever
bickering
with
her
servants
but
poor
old
lady
as
they
said
she
getting
on
now
it
makes
her
worry
and
she
found
in
annie
one
who
knew
how
to
give
at
least
as
good
as
she
got
horror
of
being
defrauded
by
servants
and
tradespeople
was
a
great
resource
and
though
she
continually
deplored
the
pleasure
of
life
abroad
these
years
of
muddling
in
and
out
of
her
house
her
garden
and
her
shops
were
probably
the
happiest
in
her
life
a
certain
conversation
contributed
not
a
little
to
this
new
happiness
she
was
at
a
for
once
she
had
been
admitted
into
the
circle
of
she
became
much
absorbed
in
them
and
she
and
a
neighbour
were
tracing
an
attack
of
influenza
from
its
source
to
its
decline
when
henrietta
hostess
came
up
to
her
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
manson
said
she
manson
is
a
cousin
of
that
dockerell
you
told
me
you
knew
miss
symons
there
had
been
no
sentiment
in
henrietta
telling
she
had
quoted
dockerell
as
an
authority
on
portugal
laurels
ah
my
cousin
dockerell
said
manson
you
knew
him
did
you
he
dead
poor
man
had
you
heard
he
died
last
year
and
once
started
upon
dockerell
she
rambled
away
with
his
history
being
one
without
much
feeling
who
could
say
everything
to
anybody
poor
fred
his
marriage
was
such
a
mistake
she
was
older
than
him
and
a
mass
of
nerves
she
caught
him
i
always
said
it
was
that
anybody
on
earth
could
have
caught
him
it
was
at
worthing
those
seaside
places
in
the
summer
are
very
dangerous
my
mother
used
to
say
must
be
thankful
it
is
worse
no
he
was
happy
there
was
a
story
that
he
really
liked
somebody
else
a
miss
simon
her
name
was
simon
or
something
like
that
where
did
she
come
from
oh
yes
willstead
he
had
some
work
there
at
one
time
beautiful
dark
miss
simon
at
least
she
was
beautiful
that
was
our
joke
there
was
a
pretty
sister
but
she
was
fair
my
sister
always
insisted
he
was
pining
after
her
but
that
was
like
fred
we
used
to
be
and
declare
it
was
indigestion
dockerell
death
was
not
very
much
to
henrietta
he
had
passed
so
entirely
out
of
her
life
but
a
dark
miss
simon
living
at
willstead
not
beautiful
she
thought
much
of
that
she
could
not
but
believe
it
must
be
herself
so
perhaps
after
all
he
did
care
she
said
to
herself
as
she
sat
over
the
fire
that
evening
she
had
reached
the
age
when
she
liked
a
good
deal
of
twilight
thinking
undisturbed
by
the
gas
but
the
news
had
come
so
late
if
only
she
had
known
before
those
months
and
years
of
unhappiness
rose
before
her
granted
that
providence
had
decreed
they
were
not
to
marry
and
looking
back
she
did
not
feel
as
if
she
wished
they
had
married
it
was
all
so
far
behind
her
she
thought
that
she
might
have
been
given
the
happiness
of
a
farewell
letter
from
him
telling
her
that
she
really
was
first
in
his
heart
i
should
never
have
seen
him
or
heard
from
him
again
of
course
i
should
not
have
wanted
it
but
it
would
have
been
so
comfortable
to
have
known
she
fell
into
her
childhood
habit
of
daydreams
if
one
can
have
daydreams
of
the
past
and
sat
such
a
long
time
absorbed
that
annie
came
in
at
last
with
her
matchbox
do
you
want
the
gas
lit
you
never
rang
i
was
gettin
quite
fidgettin
about
you
your
heart
not
very
strong
henrietta
was
composing
his
last
letter
each
moment
making
it
more
and
more
tender
she
came
back
with
a
start
to
ordinary
life
and
the
magazine
article
on
beauties
of
george
ii
court
which
lay
open
before
her
she
dismissed
her
picture
of
what
might
have
been
with
of
course
it
was
impossible
it
ridiculous
wondering
about
it
how
can
one
be
so
foolish
at
nearly
sixty
but
she
did
wonder
and
there
is
no
doubt
she
was
very
much
pleased
and
after
all
the
good
news
was
false
he
had
never
thought
of
her
again
she
confided
the
little
incident
to
evelyn
evelyn
adoring
her
husband
and
adored
by
him
had
been
so
much
accustomed
to
men
admiration
that
she
did
not
attach
great
value
to
it
she
had
seen
long
ago
her
old
lovers
pairing
happily
with
somebody
else
that
side
of
life
had
been
over
for
herself
many
years
since
her
interest
now
was
in
her
possible
marriages
and
it
was
a
little
painful
to
her
that
henrietta
should
be
so
much
excited
about
what
had
never
after
all
been
more
than
a
potential
love
affair
to
tell
the
truth
she
thought
it
a
trifle
petty
and
not
worthy
the
dignity
of
one
on
the
verge
of
old
age
she
wanted
to
be
sympathetic
and
she
was
too
kind
to
say
anything
that
would
wound
but
henrietta
could
see
that
evelyn
did
not
enter
into
her
feelings
louie
children
were
now
started
in
life
and
the
sons
were
getting
on
so
well
that
even
henrietta
owned
they
might
be
expected
to
take
the
burden
of
their
parents
upon
themselves
she
had
her
nieces
and
nephews
to
stay
minna
and
louie
also
came
to
take
the
waters
one
or
two
of
the
nieces
were
of
course
collecting
furniture
and
used
bath
as
a
centre
for
expeditions
to
the
little
country
towns
the
visits
were
very
pleasant
if
they
did
not
last
more
than
two
nights
after
two
nights
there
would
be
a
danger
of
friction
and
sometimes
friction
itself
her
nieces
and
nephews
were
all
what
she
called
modern
the
harshest
word
but
one
she
knew
a
certain
nephew
and
niece
alas
were
more
than
modern
they
were
the
harshest
word
of
all
the
nephew
had
too
profound
a
contempt
for
old
ladies
to
talk
about
anything
more
controversial
than
the
local
train
service
but
even
that
he
discovered
was
a
topic
beyond
henrietta
capacity
for
it
turned
out
after
she
had
appeared
to
be
talking
very
sensibly
about
the
afternoon
trains
that
she
was
referring
to
one
marked
with
an
a
thursday
excursion
which
destroyed
all
the
point
of
her
remarks
her
nephew
explained
this
to
her
but
she
would
stick
to
her
train
and
declare
that
the
was
a
misprint
a
misprint
in
bradshaw
what
a
mind
he
had
not
realized
that
even
an
aunt
could
be
so
childish
of
course
she
knew
she
was
wrong
but
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
that
she
was
right
because
she
was
so
much
disappointed
she
had
wanted
to
make
a
good
impression
on
her
nephew
even
if
he
were
a
radical
she
thought
men
superior
to
women
though
throughout
her
life
her
affection
and
veneration
had
been
given
to
women
miranda
miss
arundel
evelyn
she
had
an
innocent
conviction
that
men
knew
more
about
everything
except
perhaps
the
youngest
babies
and
she
was
anxious
for
masculine
good
opinion
alas
to
contradict
her
nephew
several
times
running
was
not
the
way
to
win
him
over
he
felt
that
contradiction
amply
justified
him
in
wrapping
himself
up
in
his
paper
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
vouchsafing
um
and
ah
occasionally
after
imploring
pressure
from
his
aunt
he
left
first
thing
next
morning
then
his
radical
sister
came
she
inspected
something
under
government
and
with
a
burning
faith
in
womanhood
hoped
against
hope
that
with
time
her
aunt
must
be
converted
to
think
the
right
things
with
a
mere
niece
henrietta
felt
at
liberty
and
very
competent
to
correct
but
she
little
knew
with
whom
she
was
reckoning
servants
belong
to
a
trade
union
annie
and
emma
the
cook
join
a
union
how
perfectly
ridiculous
but
why
ridiculous
aunt
etta
because
it
is
no
but
do
tell
me
aunt
etta
i
know
there
must
be
some
solid
reason
and
i
should
be
so
much
interested
to
hear
it
you
should
have
seen
annie
hat
last
sunday
enormous
pink
roses
in
it
yes
answered
her
niece
catching
her
aunt
out
very
easily
but
as
far
as
that
goes
some
ladies
have
enormous
pink
roses
yes
indeed
why
when
i
was
young
we
should
never
and
you
do
object
to
their
joining
trade
unions
yes
i
do
but
after
all
what
is
that
teachers
society
that
hilda
belongs
to
hilda
was
another
niece
but
a
trade
union
and
you
went
on
their
excursion
hilda
told
me
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
a
favourite
refuge
with
old
ladies
when
they
are
getting
the
worst
of
a
discussion
of
course
if
hilda
so
i
mean
annie
wearing
garish
hats
is
not
really
a
reason
against
her
joining
a
trade
union
you
see
my
point
do
you
i
particularly
dislike
being
interrupted
i
had
finished
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
beg
your
pardon
aunt
etta
i
am
so
sorry
what
was
it
you
were
going
to
say
henrietta
could
not
remember
and
branched
off
to
something
else
wearing
all
this
jewellery
in
the
day
is
so
common
that
girl
at
the
post
office
had
two
brooches
and
a
locket
and
she
kept
me
waiting
so
long
she
always
does
yes
but
i
think
we
must
leave
them
to
judge
what
they
like
to
wear
it
is
not
our
business
really
is
it
but
i
did
just
want
to
speak
to
you
about
this
servants
union
aunt
etta
i
wonder
if
i
might
give
annie
a
little
pamphlet
i
have
written
about
it
of
course
we
do
want
them
to
be
always
striking
or
anything
of
that
sort
the
aim
of
my
society
is
simply
to
try
and
rouse
servants
to
a
sense
of
what
it
is
missing
this
great
power
of
organization
and
solidarity
which
they
ought
to
have
i
think
annie
looks
such
a
nice
intelligent
girl
who
would
be
sure
to
have
an
influence
with
her
friends
no
she
most
tiresome
and
inconsiderate
she
go
out
this
evening
just
when
you
were
coming
because
she
wanted
to
take
her
mother
to
the
hospital
so
that
i
had
to
have
spring
and
it
is
all
very
well
for
annie
to
say
i
wonder
if
i
might
read
you
a
little
piece
out
of
my
pamphlet
aunt
etta
just
to
make
a
few
points
clear
you
see
i
want
to
get
you
in
favour
of
our
union
so
much
because
we
feel
that
mistresses
ought
to
be
with
the
servants
helping
them
to
help
themselves
and
then
we
shall
get
a
really
influential
body
of
public
opinion
which
will
do
valuable
work
in
improving
servants
conditions
henrietta
writhed
and
struggled
and
went
off
on
frivolous
pretexts
but
she
could
not
escape
the
pamphlet
which
was
extremely
able
so
was
the
author
extremely
able
but
for
a
complete
ignorance
of
human
nature
henrietta
heard
all
about
socialism
land
taxes
and
adult
suffrage
too
and
the
more
cross
she
became
the
more
kindly
and
patiently
agatha
shouted
greeting
any
specially
absurd
ebullition
with
imperturbable
pleasantness
and
how
interesting
i
am
anxious
to
get
exactly
at
your
point
of
view
that
niece
was
not
invited
again
henrietta
often
thought
with
affection
and
gratitude
of
the
little
old
aunt
who
had
died
many
years
back
but
as
she
would
have
been
the
first
to
own
her
old
age
was
not
nearly
so
successful
her
house
was
not
a
centre
for
everybody
she
had
some
elderly
ladies
with
whom
she
exchanged
visits
but
young
people
disliked
her
and
children
were
afraid
of
her
ever
since
she
settled
in
england
she
had
made
earnest
attempts
to
curb
her
temper
but
the
companion
of
a
lifetime
is
not
easily
shaken
off
at
and
more
often
than
not
she
was
quite
unaware
of
crossness
from
which
all
around
were
suffering
severely
on
the
very
rare
occasions
that
she
did
realize
it
she
went
back
to
the
self
she
had
been
as
a
child
descended
from
the
pedestal
of
her
age
and
generation
and
said
she
was
sorry
one
day
she
and
annie
had
a
long
serious
battle
the
question
in
the
first
instance
was
whether
annie
had
chipped
off
the
nose
of
the
china
on
the
mantelpiece
a
relic
of
the
old
house
at
willstead
henrietta
always
had
a
tender
feeling
for
relics
the
arguments
marshalled
by
annie
were
against
henrietta
but
arguments
never
had
much
weight
with
her
besides
the
battle
passed
on
from
the
definite
point
of
the
nose
to
vague
but
bitter
attacks
on
character
henrietta
always
had
in
her
mind
an
ideal
servant
who
accepted
scolding
not
merely
with
meekness
but
with
gratitude
and
was
fond
of
quoting
her
to
the
exasperation
of
the
real
servants
after
half
an
hour
annie
began
to
cry
noisily
so
that
henrietta
words
were
drowned
the
interview
came
to
an
end
annie
went
downstairs
and
told
cook
but
she
wasted
few
tears
or
thoughts
on
the
matter
and
almost
at
once
they
were
laughing
cheerfully
over
their
young
men
as
they
sat
at
needlework
henrietta
did
think
fidgeting
about
the
room
while
she
thought
taking
things
out
of
their
places
and
putting
them
where
they
ought
not
to
be
in
a
fuss
of
discomfort
at
last
she
rang
the
bell
the
lamp
please
annie
the
lamp
said
annie
but
you
do
want
it
for
half
an
hour
yet
do
you
it
such
a
beautiful
evening
it
was
impossible
ever
to
quell
annie
the
lamp
please
repeated
henrietta
and
i
should
like
to
i
think
you
ought
to
i
feel
that
in
a
what
i
want
you
to
realize
is
that
you
should
keep
a
great
watch
over
your
temper
when
one
comes
to
my
age
one
sees
that
there
is
and
you
should
not
put
it
off
till
too
late
as
people
sometimes
as
i
have
done
annie
sharp
ears
heard
the
last
little
murmur
henrietta
rather
hoped
they
would
not
though
it
was
for
the
sake
of
the
murmur
that
she
had
rung
the
bell
annie
said
yes
very
pleasantly
and
yielded
about
the
lamp
she
told
cook
afterwards
with
some
amusement
she
funny
i
always
said
that
but
she
added
i
known
some
i
should
say
was
funnier
this
opinion
may
be
worth
recording
as
it
was
one
of
the
highest
tributes
to
her
character
henrietta
ever
received
on
the
whole
during
those
latter
years
she
improved
and
in
the
general
reformation
of
her
character
she
raised
the
standard
of
her
reading
she
confined
herself
in
the
mornings
and
afternoon
to
mildly
scandalous
memoirs
of
frenchwomen
and
biographies
of
church
dignitaries
keeping
her
costume
novels
for
the
evening
she
often
saw
evelyn
and
they
talked
of
the
past
but
they
never
regained
the
almost
heavenly
intimacy
of
that
night
they
seldom
met
without
some
disagreeableness
from
henrietta
and
she
did
not
like
the
boys
there
was
nothing
of
evelyn
in
them
while
they
for
their
part
could
not
imagine
why
their
mother
cared
for
their
aunt
henrietta
it
was
a
continual
struggle
for
evelyn
not
to
be
impatient
with
her
much
as
she
longed
to
she
could
not
keep
on
the
high
plane
of
devotion
which
had
brought
such
happiness
to
both
chapter
xiii
henrietta
died
when
she
was
her
father
and
stepmother
were
long
dead
also
her
second
brother
whom
none
of
the
family
had
seen
for
years
when
her
relations
were
sent
for
it
was
very
cold
weather
in
january
and
louie
and
minna
did
not
obey
the
summons
they
deplored
it
continually
afterwards
and
explained
to
one
another
how
appalling
the
wind
had
been
and
what
care
they
had
to
take
for
their
children
sake
and
how
henrietta
had
frightened
them
so
much
the
year
before
by
sending
for
them
when
there
was
no
need
that
they
naturally
could
not
be
expected
to
realize
that
this
time
it
really
was
important
william
came
looking
more
benevolent
than
ever
with
his
very
becoming
white
hair
henrietta
said
that
she
thought
it
was
the
last
time
she
should
see
him
but
he
assured
her
it
was
just
the
cold
which
had
pulled
her
down
a
little
and
she
would
be
all
right
again
as
soon
as
the
wind
changed
it
wretched
knocks
everybody
up
he
looked
so
hearty
and
mundane
that
it
almost
seemed
when
he
was
in
the
room
as
if
there
could
not
be
such
a
thing
as
death
they
talked
about
the
drought
last
summer
and
william
son
who
was
a
planter
in
ceylon
and
the
noise
of
the
in
london
until
william
said
he
must
go
for
his
train
he
was
allowing
a
quarter
of
an
hour
too
much
time
for
he
was
able
to
stay
and
talk
a
little
while
with
the
doctor
who
called
when
he
was
there
there
is
any
chance
you
say
no
i
am
afraid
not
miss
symons
heart
has
been
delicate
for
some
years
it
gives
her
very
little
strength
to
stand
against
this
attack
um
i
was
afraid
so
said
william
and
he
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
house
and
buy
a
the
inspector
niece
came
down
uninvited
very
energetic
and
very
kind
in
using
the
last
few
days
of
her
holidays
in
nursing
a
disagreeable
reactionary
relation
she
dominated
the
nurse
who
was
much
meeker
than
nurses
usually
are
and
quite
quelled
her
poor
aunt
too
weak
to
protest
even
at
attacks
on
the
monarchy
but
henrietta
was
much
happier
when
the
niece
holidays
came
to
an
end
and
she
was
left
to
die
quietly
and
dully
with
the
nurse
evelyn
was
away
in
egypt
with
herbert
for
her
health
and
by
a
most
unfortunate
accident
she
did
not
get
the
first
telegram
announcing
henrietta
dangerous
illness
poor
henrietta
asked
constantly
if
there
was
nothing
from
her
and
as
she
got
weaker
and
a
little
wandering
she
kept
on
crying
like
a
child
i
want
evelyn
they
cabled
again
and
when
the
answer
came
starting
home
at
once
it
was
too
late
and
henrietta
was
not
sufficiently
herself
to
understand
it
as
soon
as
evelyn
got
home
she
went
to
bath
the
little
house
was
still
as
it
was
but
for
some
legacies
which
a
careful
nephew
had
already
abstracted
but
the
place
of
the
dead
seemed
to
have
been
filled
even
more
quickly
than
usual
annie
as
she
said
had
only
waited
till
the
pore
old
lady
was
taken
to
marry
comfortably
with
a
saddler
and
the
parlourmaid
was
already
established
in
a
very
smart
town
situation
there
was
an
unknown
caretaker
to
look
after
the
house
which
was
to
let
evelyn
saw
the
doctor
and
the
clergyman
who
both
spoke
kindly
of
miss
symons
we
shall
miss
your
sister
very
much
said
vaughan
she
was
always
doing
kind
things
and
he
did
miss
her
to
a
certain
extent
but
there
is
a
ceaseless
supply
of
generous
touchy
incapable
old
ladies
in
england
and
he
could
not
be
expected
to
miss
her
very
much
evelyn
went
to
see
the
nurse
and
could
hear
from
her
more
of
what
she
wanted
the
nurse
was
a
kind
sweet
girl
the
centre
of
an
affectionate
family
and
engaged
to
a
devoted
young
clerk
oh
ferrers
if
only
you
could
have
come
back
in
time
she
said
sobbing
or
if
you
could
have
written
she
want
you
so
every
time
there
was
a
ring
it
was
that
from
her
and
i
heard
her
say
to
herself
thought
she
would
be
to
come
i
simply
had
to
go
out
in
the
passage
i
could
keep
back
my
tears
and
of
course
one
must
always
be
bright
before
a
patient
it
is
so
bad
for
them
if
one
is
some
nieces
and
nephews
came
and
one
of
them
stayed
several
days
and
two
brothers
i
think
and
there
were
several
members
of
the
family
there
for
the
funeral
and
she
had
some
simply
lovely
wreaths
and
the
church
was
nice
and
full
numbers
of
her
poor
people
were
there
brought
there
as
surely
the
kind
nurse
knew
not
from
love
of
henrietta
but
from
love
of
funerals
but
when
your
wire
did
come
i
cried
for
joy
though
we
could
make
her
take
it
in
poor
dear
still
it
seemed
as
if
someone
really
cared
for
her
oh
she
looked
so
lovely
and
peaceful
at
the
end
all
the
trouble
gone
this
was
a
comforting
deception
which
the
nurse
thought
it
justifiable
to
practise
on
relations
for
in
fact
death
had
not
changed
henrietta
there
had
been
no
transfiguration
to
beauty
and
nobility
she
looked
what
she
had
been
in
life
insignificant
feeble
and
unhappy
miss
symons
asked
me
to
give
you
this
box
said
the
nurse
she
made
me
promise
i
would
give
it
you
over
and
over
again
evelyn
found
it
was
an
inlaid
sandalwood
box
which
she
had
sent
from
india
as
a
present
from
the
first
baby
in
it
she
found
herbert
letter
announcing
the
death
of
little
madeline
hers
and
the
other
two
photographs
and
a
sheet
of
notepaper
tied
with
blue
ribbon
on
it
was
written
i
ca
tell
you
how
much
good
you
have
done
me
i
seem
to
have
been
living
for
this
for
fifteen
years
evelyn
september
as
she
read
it
evelyn
remembered
what
she
had
long
forgotten
that
this
was
what
she
had
once
said
to
henrietta
when
she
walked
to
the
hotel
it
was
a
bright
sunny
afternoon
and
snow
was
on
the
ground
she
went
to
her
room
to
take
off
her
things
but
she
stood
instead
at
the
window
too
intent
on
what
she
had
heard
to
be
capable
of
anything
her
heart
was
almost
bursting
to
think
that
henrietta
should
have
treasured
all
these
years
the
little
love
she
had
given
her
crumbs
which
she
had
as
it
were
left
over
from
her
husband
and
boys
love
not
even
for
henrietta
own
sake
but
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
children
she
with
all
the
riches
of
love
poured
on
her
and
henrietta
with
so
little
i
was
cold
selfish
i
think
of
her
i
forgot
her
i
criticized
her
it
was
all
my
fault
but
even
at
this
moment
of
exaltation
evelyn
realized
that
it
was
not
her
fault
but
henrietta
own
that
it
was
because
she
was
so
unlovable
that
she
was
so
little
loved
but
if
she
had
had
the
chance
she
would
have
been
unlovable
she
was
capable
of
greater
love
than
any
of
us
and
she
never
had
the
chance
if
there
is
any
justice
and
mercy
in
the
world
how
can
they
allow
a
poor
weak
human
creature
to
have
so
few
opportunities
such
hard
temptations
and
when
it
yields
to
temptation
to
suffer
so
cruelly
and
now
i
am
to
go
back
and
be
happy
with
herbert
and
the
boys
and
to
feel
quite
truly
that
i
did
everything
i
could
ca
bear
she
was
so
much
filled
with
her
thoughts
that
she
had
not
observed
the
flight
of
time
she
looked
up
and
was
suddenly
aware
that
the
night
had
come
and
that
the
sky
was
shining
with
innumerable
stars
at
the
same
moment
she
felt
inextricably
mingled
with
the
stars
a
rush
of
the
most
exquisite
sensation
emotion
replenishment
she
had
ever
known
she
felt
through
every
fibre
of
her
being
that
it
was
all
perfectly
well
with
henrietta
and
that
the
bitterness
aimlessness
and
emptiness
of
her
life
was
made
up
to
her
this
conviction
was
a
thousand
times
more
real
to
her
than
the
room
in
which
she
was
standing
more
real
than
the
stars
more
real
than
herself
tears
of
delight
came
raining
down
her
cheeks
and
she
found
that
she
was
saying
over
and
over
again
darling
i
am
so
glad
poor
childish
words
but
no
more
inadequate
than
the
noblest
in
the
language
to
express
her
unspeakable
comfort
beyond
all
utterance
even
beyond
thought
how
often
she
said
these
words
or
how
long
this
bliss
lasted
she
could
not
tell
a
strange
remembrance
of
it
stayed
with
her
for
some
days
she
told
her
husband
and
he
said
i
am
very
glad
of
anything
that
can
be
a
comfort
to
you
dearest
but
he
looked
at
her
anxiously
and
thought
it
was
a
sign
that
she
was
to
be
ill
again
however
she
continued
well
and
strong
she
told
no
one
else
but
from
henceforth
she
was
perfectly
happy
about
henrietta
