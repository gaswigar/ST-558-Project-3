the

outlet

u
five
outlets
of
a
great
sorrow
has
come
into
the
heart
of
god
let
it
be
told
only
in
hushed
voice
one
of
his
worlds
is
hush
your
voice
yet
more
is
that
prodigal
world
let
your
voice
soften
down
still
more
have
to
the
prodigal
part
of
the
story
but
in
softest
tones
yet
he
has
won
some
of
us
back
with
his
strong
tender
love
and
now
let
the
voice
ring
out
with
great
gladness
we
won
ones
may
be
the
pathway
back
to
god
for
the
others
that
is
his
earnest
desire
that
should
be
our
dominant
ambition
for
that
purpose
he
has
endowed
us
with
peculiar
power
there
is
one
inlet
of
power
in
the
life
anybody
life
any
kind
of
power
just
one
inlet
the
holy
spirit
he
is
power
he
is
in
every
one
who
opens
his
door
to
god
he
eagerly
enters
every
open
door
he
comes
in
by
our
invitation
and
consent
his
presence
within
is
the
vital
thing
but
with
many
of
us
while
he
is
in
he
is
not
in
control
in
as
guest
not
as
host
that
is
to
say
he
is
hindered
in
his
natural
movements
tied
up
so
that
he
can
not
do
what
he
would
and
so
we
are
not
conscious
or
only
partially
conscious
of
his
presence
and
others
are
still
less
so
but
to
yield
to
his
mastery
to
cultivate
his
friendship
to
give
him
full
swing
that
will
result
in
what
is
called
power
one
inlet
of
power
the
holy
spirit
in
control
there
are
five
outlets
of
power
five
avenues
through
which
this
one
within
shows
himself
and
reveals
his
power
first
through
the
life
what
we
are
just
simply
what
we
are
if
we
be
right
the
power
of
god
will
be
constantly
flowing
out
though
we
be
not
conscious
of
it
it
throws
the
keenest
kind
of
emphasis
on
a
man
being
right
in
his
life
there
will
be
an
eager
desire
to
serve
yet
we
may
constantly
do
more
in
what
we
are
than
in
what
we
do
we
may
serve
better
in
the
lives
we
live
than
in
the
best
service
we
ever
give
the
memory
of
that
should
bring
rest
to
your
spirit
when
a
bit
tired
and
may
be
disheartened
because
tired
second
through
the
lips
what
we
say
it
may
be
said
stammeringly
and
falteringly
but
if
said
your
best
with
the
desire
to
please
the
master
it
will
be
i
have
heard
a
man
talk
and
he
stuttered
and
blushed
and
got
his
grammar
badly
tangled
but
my
heart
burned
as
i
listened
and
i
have
heard
a
man
talk
with
smooth
speech
and
it
rolled
off
me
as
easily
as
it
rolled
out
of
him
do
your
best
and
leave
the
rest
if
we
are
in
touch
with
god
his
fire
burns
whether
the
tongue
stammer
or
has
good
control
of
its
powers
third
through
our
service
what
we
do
it
may
be
done
bunglingly
and
blunderingly
your
best
may
not
be
the
best
but
if
it
be
your
best
it
will
bring
a
harvest
fourth
through
our
money
what
we
do
not
keep
but
loosen
out
for
god
money
comes
the
nearest
to
omnipotence
of
anything
we
handle
and
fifth
through
our
prayer
what
we
claim
in
jesus
name
and
by
all
odds
the
greatest
of
these
is
the
outlet
through
prayer
the
power
of
a
life
touches
just
one
spot
but
the
touch
is
tremendous
what
is
there
we
think
to
be
compared
with
a
pure
unselfish
gently
strong
life
yet
its
power
is
limited
to
one
spot
where
it
is
being
lived
power
through
the
lips
depends
wholly
upon
the
life
back
of
the
lips
words
that
come
brokenly
are
often
made
burning
and
eloquent
by
the
life
behind
them
and
words
that
are
smooth
and
easy
often
have
all
their
meaning
sapped
by
the
life
back
of
them
power
through
service
may
be
great
and
may
be
touching
many
spots
yet
it
is
always
less
than
that
of
a
life
power
through
money
depends
wholly
upon
the
motive
back
of
the
money
begrudged
money
stained
money
soils
the
treasury
that
which
comes
nearest
to
omnipotence
also
comes
nearest
to
impotence
but
the
power
loosened
out
through
prayer
is
as
tremendous
at
the
least
to
say
no
more
just
now
is
as
tremendous
as
the
power
of
a
true
fragrant
life
and
mark
you
may
touch
not
one
spot
but
wherever
in
the
whole
round
world
you
may
choose
to
turn
it
the
greatest
thing
any
one
can
do
for
god
and
for
man
is
to
pray
it
is
not
the
only
thing
but
it
is
the
chief
thing
a
correct
balancing
of
the
possible
powers
one
may
exert
puts
it
first
for
if
a
man
is
to
pray
right
he
must
first
right
in
his
motives
and
life
and
if
a
man
right
and
put
the
practice
of
praying
in
its
right
place
then
his
serving
and
giving
and
speaking
will
be
fairly
fragrant
with
the
presence
of
god
the
great
people
of
the
earth
are
the
people
who
pray
i
do
not
mean
those
who
talk
about
prayer
nor
those
who
say
they
believe
in
prayer
nor
yet
those
who
can
explain
about
prayer
but
i
mean
these
people
who
time
and
they
have
not
time
it
must
be
taken
from
something
else
this
something
else
is
important
very
important
and
pressing
than
prayer
there
are
people
that
put
prayer
first
and
group
the
other
items
in
life
schedule
around
and
after
prayer
these
are
the
people
who
are
doing
the
most
for
god
in
winning
souls
in
solving
problems
in
awakening
churches
in
supplying
both
men
and
money
for
mission
posts
in
keeping
fresh
and
strong
these
lives
far
off
in
sacrificial
service
on
the
foreign
field
where
the
thickest
fighting
is
going
on
in
keeping
the
old
earth
sweet
awhile
longer
it
is
wholly
a
secret
service
we
do
not
know
who
these
people
are
though
sometimes
shrewd
guesses
may
be
made
i
often
think
that
sometimes
we
pass
some
woman
quietly
slipping
out
of
church
gown
been
turned
two
or
three
times
bonnet
fixed
over
more
than
once
hands
that
have
not
known
much
of
the
softening
of
gloves
and
we
hardly
giver
her
a
passing
thought
and
do
not
know
nor
guess
that
perhaps
is
the
one
who
is
doing
far
more
for
her
church
and
for
the
world
and
for
god
than
a
hundred
who
would
claim
more
attention
and
thought
she
truly
prays
as
the
spirit
of
god
inspires
and
guides
let
me
put
it
this
way
god
will
do
as
a
result
of
the
praying
of
the
humblest
one
here
what
otherwise
he
not
do
yes
i
can
make
it
stronger
than
that
and
i
must
make
it
stronger
for
the
book
does
listen
god
will
do
in
answer
to
the
prayer
of
the
weakest
one
here
what
otherwise
he
not
do
oh
someone
thinks
you
are
getting
that
too
strong
now
well
you
listen
to
jesus
own
words
in
that
last
long
quiet
talk
he
had
with
the
eleven
men
between
the
upper
room
and
the
john
preserves
much
of
that
talk
for
us
listen
ye
did
not
choose
me
but
i
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
ye
should
go
and
bear
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
abide
that
listen
a
part
of
the
purpose
why
we
have
been
chosen
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
give
it
you
mark
that
word
may
not
shall
this
time
but
shall
throws
the
matter
over
on
god
his
purpose
may
throws
it
over
upon
us
our
cooperation
that
is
to
say
our
praying
makes
it
possible
for
god
to
do
what
otherwise
he
could
not
do
and
if
you
think
into
it
a
bit
this
fits
in
with
the
true
conception
of
prayer
in
its
simplest
analysis
prayer
all
prayer
has
must
have
two
parts
first
a
god
to
give
yes
you
say
certainly
a
god
wealthy
willing
all
of
that
and
just
as
certainly
there
must
be
a
second
factor
man
to
man
willingness
is
god
channel
to
the
earth
god
never
crowds
nor
coerces
everything
god
does
for
man
and
through
man
he
does
with
man
consent
always
with
due
reverence
but
very
plainly
let
it
be
said
that
god
can
do
nothing
for
the
man
with
shut
hand
and
shut
life
there
must
be
an
open
hand
and
heart
and
life
which
god
can
give
what
he
longs
to
an
open
life
an
open
hand
open
upward
is
the
pipe
line
of
communication
between
the
heart
of
god
and
this
poor
befooled
old
world
our
prayer
is
god
opportunity
to
get
into
the
world
that
would
shut
him
out
u
in
touch
with
a
prayer
opens
a
whole
planet
to
a
man
activities
i
can
as
really
be
touching
hearts
for
god
in
far
away
india
or
china
through
prayer
as
though
i
were
there
not
in
as
many
ways
as
though
there
but
as
truly
understand
me
i
think
the
highest
possible
of
service
is
in
those
far
off
lands
there
the
need
is
greatest
the
darkness
densest
and
the
pleading
call
most
eloquently
pathetic
and
if
one
go
there
happy
man
if
one
be
to
go
to
the
honoured
place
of
service
he
may
then
use
all
five
outlets
direct
in
the
spot
where
he
is
yet
this
is
only
one
spot
but
his
relationship
is
as
wide
as
his
and
his
sympathies
should
be
a
man
may
be
in
africa
but
if
his
heart
be
in
touch
with
jesus
it
will
be
burning
for
prayer
puts
us
into
direct
dynamic
touch
with
a
world
a
man
may
go
aside
and
shut
his
door
and
as
really
spend
a
in
india
i
am
thinking
of
my
words
as
i
say
them
it
seems
so
much
to
say
and
yet
it
is
true
as
really
spend
a
half
hour
of
his
life
in
india
for
god
as
though
he
were
there
in
person
that
true
if
it
be
true
surely
you
and
i
must
get
more
for
this
secret
service
without
any
doubt
he
may
turn
his
key
and
be
for
a
bit
of
time
as
potentially
in
china
by
the
power
of
prayer
as
though
there
in
actual
bodily
form
i
say
present
of
course
not
consciously
present
but
in
the
exerted
upon
he
may
be
truly
present
at
the
objective
point
of
his
prayer
he
may
give
a
new
meaning
to
the
printed
page
being
read
by
some
native
down
in
africa
he
may
give
a
new
tongue
of
flame
to
the
preacher
or
teacher
he
may
make
it
easier
for
men
to
accept
the
story
of
jesus
and
then
to
yield
themselves
to
jesus
yonder
men
swept
and
swayed
by
evil
spirits
and
by
prejudices
for
generations
make
it
easier
for
them
to
accept
the
story
and
if
need
be
to
cut
with
loved
ones
and
step
out
and
up
into
a
new
life
some
earnest
heart
enters
an
objection
here
perhaps
you
are
thinking
that
if
you
were
there
you
could
influence
men
by
your
personal
contact
by
the
living
voice
so
you
could
and
there
must
be
the
personal
touch
would
that
there
were
many
times
more
going
for
that
blessed
personal
touch
but
this
is
the
thing
to
mark
keenly
both
for
those
who
may
go
and
for
those
who
must
stay
no
matter
where
you
are
you
do
more
through
your
praying
than
through
your
personality
if
you
were
in
india
you
could
your
personality
to
your
that
would
be
a
great
thing
to
do
but
whether
there
or
here
you
must
first
win
the
victory
every
step
every
life
every
foot
of
the
way
in
secret
in
the
and
then
add
the
mighty
touch
of
your
personality
in
service
you
can
do
than
pray
you
have
prayed
but
you
can
do
more
than
pray
you
have
prayed
and
just
there
is
where
we
have
all
seemed
to
make
a
slip
at
times
and
many
of
us
are
yet
making
it
a
bad
slip
we
think
we
can
do
more
where
we
are
through
our
service
then
prayer
to
give
power
to
service
with
the
blackest
underscoring
of
emphasis
let
it
be
said
no
we
can
do
no
thing
of
real
power
until
we
have
done
the
prayer
thing
here
is
a
man
by
my
side
i
can
talk
to
him
i
can
bring
my
personality
to
bear
upon
him
that
i
may
win
him
but
before
i
can
influence
his
will
a
jot
for
god
i
must
first
have
won
the
victory
in
the
secret
place
intercession
is
winning
the
victory
over
the
chief
and
service
is
taking
the
field
after
the
chief
is
driven
off
such
service
is
limited
by
the
limitation
of
personality
to
one
place
this
called
prayer
puts
a
man
into
direct
dynamic
touch
with
a
planet
there
are
some
of
our
friends
who
think
themselves
of
the
practical
sort
who
say
the
great
thing
is
work
prayer
is
good
and
right
but
the
great
need
is
to
be
doing
something
practical
the
truth
is
that
when
one
understands
about
prayer
and
puts
prayer
in
its
right
place
in
his
life
he
finds
a
new
motive
power
burning
in
his
bones
to
be
and
further
he
finds
that
it
is
the
doing
that
grows
out
of
praying
that
is
mightiest
in
touching
human
hearts
and
he
finds
further
yet
with
a
great
joy
that
he
may
be
something
for
an
entire
world
his
service
becomes
as
broad
as
his
master
thought
u
intercession
is
it
helps
greatly
to
remember
that
intercession
is
service
the
chief
service
of
a
life
on
god
plan
it
is
unlike
all
other
forms
of
service
and
superior
to
them
in
this
that
it
has
fewer
limitations
in
all
other
service
we
are
constantly
limited
by
space
bodily
strength
equipment
material
obstacles
difficulties
involved
in
the
peculiar
differences
of
personality
prayer
knows
no
such
limitations
it
ignores
space
it
may
be
free
of
expenditure
of
bodily
strength
where
rightly
practiced
and
powers
are
under
proper
control
it
goes
directly
by
the
telegraphy
of
spirit
into
men
hearts
quietly
passes
through
walls
and
past
locks
unhindered
and
comes
into
most
direct
touch
with
the
inner
heart
and
will
to
be
affected
in
service
as
ordinarily
understood
one
is
limited
to
the
space
where
his
body
is
the
distance
his
voice
can
reach
the
length
of
time
he
can
keep
going
before
he
must
quit
to
eat
or
rest
or
sleep
he
is
limited
by
walls
and
locks
by
the
prejudices
of
men
minds
and
by
those
peculiar
differences
of
temperament
which
must
be
studied
in
laying
siege
to
hearts
the
whole
circle
of
endeavour
in
winning
men
includes
such
an
infinite
variety
there
is
speaking
the
truth
to
a
number
of
persons
and
to
one
at
a
time
the
doing
of
needed
kindly
acts
of
helpfulness
supplying
food
and
the
like
there
is
teaching
the
almost
omnipotent
ministry
of
money
the
constant
contact
with
a
pure
unselfish
life
letter
writing
ink
in
endless
variety
all
these
are
in
god
plan
for
winning
men
but
the
intensely
fascinating
fact
to
mark
is
this
that
the
real
victory
in
all
of
this
service
is
won
in
secret
beforehand
by
prayer
and
these
other
indispensable
things
are
the
moving
upon
the
works
of
the
enemy
and
claiming
the
victory
already
won
and
when
these
things
are
put
in
their
proper
order
prayer
first
and
the
other
things
second
i
say
not
omitted
not
slurred
over
done
with
all
the
earnestness
and
power
of
brain
and
hand
and
heart
possible
but
done
the
victory
has
been
won
in
secret
against
the
real
foe
and
done
the
winner
is
still
claiming
the
victory
already
assured
then
will
come
far
greater
achievements
in
this
outer
open
service
then
we
go
into
this
service
with
that
fine
spirit
of
expectancy
that
sweeps
the
field
at
the
start
and
steadily
sticks
on
the
stubbornly
contested
spots
until
the
whipped
foe
turns
tail
and
goes
prayer
is
striking
the
winning
blow
at
the
concealed
enemy
service
is
gathering
up
the
results
of
that
blow
among
the
men
we
see
and
touch
great
patience
and
tact
and
persistence
are
needed
in
the
service
because
each
man
must
be
influenced
in
his
own
will
but
the
shrewd
strategy
that
wins
puts
the
keen
stiff
secret
fighting
first
u
the
spirit
electricity
is
a
strange
element
it
is
catalogued
in
the
study
of
physics
it
is
supposed
to
be
properly
classed
among
the
forces
of
nature
yet
it
seems
to
have
many
properties
of
the
spirit
world
those
who
know
most
of
it
say
they
know
least
of
what
it
is
some
of
the
laws
of
its
being
have
been
learned
and
so
its
marvellous
power
harnessed
for
use
but
in
much
ignorance
of
what
it
is
it
seems
almost
to
belong
somewhere
in
between
the
physical
and
spirit
realms
it
furnishes
many
similes
of
graphic
helpfulness
in
understanding
more
nearly
much
truth
of
the
spirit
life
in
the
where
the
electricity
is
being
wooed
into
harnessing
or
generated
as
the
experts
say
is
found
a
switchboard
or
with
a
number
of
boards
here
in
a
large
city
plant
a
man
may
go
and
turn
a
switch
that
is
move
a
little
handle
a
very
short
distance
it
is
a
very
simple
act
easily
performed
involving
almost
no
strength
but
that
act
has
loosened
the
power
in
the
house
back
of
the
switchboard
out
along
the
wires
and
perhaps
lighted
a
whole
section
of
the
city
he
goes
in
again
at
another
hour
and
turns
set
of
switches
and
and
sets
in
motion
maybe
scores
of
cars
carrying
swiftly
hundreds
of
passengers
again
he
goes
in
and
moves
the
little
handles
and
sets
in
motion
the
wheels
in
some
factory
employing
hundreds
of
operatives
it
is
a
secret
service
usually
as
far
as
any
observers
are
concerned
it
is
a
very
quiet
matter
of
fact
service
but
the
power
influenced
is
unmeasured
and
immeasurable
and
no
one
seemingly
thus
far
can
explain
the
mysterious
but
tremendous
agent
involved
does
the
fluid
it
a
fluid
or
what
pass
the
wire
or
the
wire
the
experts
say
they
do
not
know
but
the
laws
which
it
obeys
are
known
and
as
men
comply
with
them
its
almost
omnipotence
is
manifested
just
such
a
in
the
spirit
realm
is
one
every
one
who
will
may
have
such
a
spirit
in
his
life
there
he
may
go
and
in
compliance
with
the
laws
of
the
power
used
loosen
out
the
gracious
persuasive
irresistible
power
of
god
he
wills
now
in
japan
now
in
china
among
the
hungry
human
hearts
of
india
plains
and
mountains
again
in
africa
which
is
full
as
near
to
where
jesus
sits
as
is
england
or
america
and
now
into
the
house
across
the
alley
from
your
home
and
down
in
the
slum
district
and
now
into
your
preacher
heart
for
next
sunday
work
and
now
again
unto
the
hearts
of
those
you
will
be
meeting
in
the
settlement
house
or
the
mission
school
children
are
not
allowed
at
the
electrical
switchboard
nor
any
unskilled
hand
for
misuse
means
possibility
of
great
damage
to
property
and
life
and
the
spirit
switchboard
does
not
yield
to
the
unskilled
touch
though
sometimes
there
seems
to
be
much
tampering
by
those
with
crude
fingers
and
with
selfish
desire
to
turn
this
current
to
personal
advantage
merely
it
takes
skill
here
yet
such
is
our
winsome
god
wondrous
plan
that
skill
may
come
to
any
one
who
is
willing
simply
that
who
is
willing
and
it
comes
too
strange
too
as
with
the
electrical
counterpart
the
thing
is
beyond
full
or
satisfying
explanation
how
does
it
come
to
pass
that
a
man
turns
a
few
handles
and
miles
away
great
wheels
begin
to
revolve
and
enormous
power
is
manifested
will
some
one
kindly
explain
yet
we
know
it
is
so
and
men
govern
their
actions
by
that
knowledge
how
does
it
come
to
pass
that
a
woman
in
iowa
prays
for
the
conversion
of
her
skeptical
husband
and
he
down
in
the
thick
of
the
most
absorbing
congress
washington
has
known
since
the
civil
war
and
in
full
ignorance
of
her
purpose
becomes
conscious
and
repeatedly
conscious
of
the
presence
and
power
of
the
god
in
whose
existence
he
does
not
believe
and
months
afterwards
with
his
keen
legally
trained
mind
finds
the
calendar
to
fit
together
the
beginning
of
her
praying
with
the
beginning
of
his
unwelcome
consciousness
will
some
one
kindly
explain
ah
who
can
adequately
yet
the
facts
easy
ascertainable
are
there
and
evidenced
in
the
complete
change
in
the
life
and
calling
of
the
man
how
comes
it
to
pass
that
a
woman
in
missouri
praying
for
a
friend
of
keen
intellectual
skeptically
in
glasgow
who
can
skillfully
measure
and
parry
argument
yet
finds
afterwards
that
the
time
of
her
praying
is
the
time
of
his
at
first
decidedly
unwelcome
but
finally
radical
change
of
convictions
yet
groups
of
thoughtful
men
and
women
know
these
two
instances
to
be
even
so
though
unable
to
explain
how
and
as
the
mysterious
electrical
power
is
being
used
by
obedience
to
its
laws
even
so
is
the
power
of
prayer
being
used
by
many
who
understand
simply
enough
of
its
laws
to
obey
and
to
bring
the
stupendous
results
u
the
broad
inner
this
suggests
at
once
that
the
rightly
rounded
christian
life
has
two
sides
the
and
the
side
to
most
of
us
the
outer
side
seems
the
greater
the
living
the
serving
the
giving
the
doing
the
absorption
in
life
work
the
contact
with
men
with
the
great
majority
the
sheer
struggle
for
existence
these
take
the
greater
thought
and
time
of
us
all
they
seem
to
be
the
great
business
of
life
even
to
those
of
us
who
thoroughly
believe
in
the
inner
life
but
when
the
real
eyes
open
the
inner
eyes
that
see
the
unseen
the
change
of
perspective
is
first
ludicrous
then
terrific
then
pathetic
ludicrous
because
of
the
change
of
proportions
terrific
because
of
the
issues
at
stake
pathetic
because
of
strong
men
that
see
not
and
push
on
spending
splendid
strength
whittling
sticks
the
outer
side
is
narrow
in
its
limits
it
has
to
do
with
food
and
clothing
bricks
and
lumber
time
and
the
passing
hour
the
culture
of
the
mind
the
joys
of
social
contact
the
smoothing
of
the
way
for
the
suffering
and
it
needs
not
to
be
said
that
these
are
right
they
belong
in
the
picture
they
are
its
physical
background
the
inner
side
all
of
and
stretches
infinitely
beyond
its
limits
are
broad
broad
as
the
home
of
man
with
its
enswathing
atmosphere
added
it
touches
the
inner
spirit
it
moves
in
upon
the
motives
the
loves
the
heart
it
moves
out
upon
the
myriad
and
forces
that
swarm
ceaselessly
about
the
earth
staining
and
sliming
men
souls
and
lives
it
moves
up
to
the
arm
of
god
in
cooperation
with
his
great
for
a
world
shall
we
follow
for
a
day
one
who
has
gotten
the
true
perspective
here
is
the
outer
side
a
humble
home
a
narrow
circle
tending
the
baby
patching
sewing
cooking
calling
measuring
dry
goods
chopping
a
typewriter
checking
up
a
ledger
feeding
the
swift
machinery
endless
stitching
gripping
a
locomotive
lever
pushing
the
plow
tending
the
stock
doing
the
chores
tiresome
examination
papers
and
all
the
rest
of
the
endless
endless
doing
day
by
day
of
the
commonplace
treadmill
things
that
must
be
done
that
fill
out
the
day
of
the
great
majority
of
human
lives
this
one
whom
we
are
following
unseen
is
doing
quietly
cheerily
his
daily
round
with
a
bit
of
sunshine
in
his
face
a
light
in
his
eye
and
lightness
in
his
step
and
the
commonplace
place
becomes
uncommon
by
reason
of
the
presence
of
this
man
with
the
uncommon
spirit
he
is
working
for
god
no
better
he
is
working
with
god
he
has
an
unseen
friend
at
his
side
that
changes
all
the
common
drudgery
ceases
to
be
common
and
ceases
to
be
drudgery
because
it
is
done
for
such
an
uncommon
master
that
is
the
outer
the
narrow
side
of
this
life
not
narrow
in
itself
but
in
its
proportion
to
the
whole
now
hold
your
breath
and
look
for
here
is
the
inner
side
where
the
larger
work
of
life
is
being
done
here
is
the
quiet
bit
of
time
alone
with
god
with
the
book
the
door
is
shut
as
the
master
said
now
it
is
the
morning
hour
with
a
bit
of
made
light
for
the
sun
is
busy
yet
farther
east
now
it
is
the
evening
hour
with
the
sun
speeding
towards
western
service
and
the
bed
invitingly
near
there
is
a
looking
up
into
face
then
keen
but
reverent
reading
and
then
a
simple
intelligent
pleading
with
its
many
variations
of
this
thy
will
be
done
in
the
victor
name
god
himself
is
here
in
this
inner
room
the
angels
are
here
this
room
opens
out
into
and
is
in
direct
touch
with
a
spirit
space
as
wide
as
the
earth
the
horizon
of
this
room
is
as
broad
as
the
globe
god
presence
with
this
man
makes
it
so
a
half
hour
is
spent
in
china
for
its
missionaries
its
native
christians
its
millions
the
printed
page
the
personal
contact
the
telling
of
the
story
the
school
the
dispensary
the
hospital
and
in
through
the
petitions
runs
this
golden
thread
victory
in
jesus
name
victory
in
jesus
name
thy
will
be
being
done
the
other
will
undone
victory
in
jesus
name
tomorrow
bit
of
time
is
largely
spent
in
india
perhaps
and
so
this
man
with
the
narrow
outer
horizon
and
the
broad
inner
horizon
pushes
his
through
japan
india
ceylon
persia
arabia
turkey
africa
europe
papal
lands
the
south
american
states
the
home
land
its
cities
frontiers
slums
the
home
town
the
home
church
the
man
across
the
alley
in
and
out
out
and
in
the
tide
of
prayer
sweeps
quietly
resistlessly
day
by
day
this
is
the
true
christian
life
this
man
is
winning
souls
and
refreshing
lives
in
these
lands
and
in
places
as
truly
as
though
he
were
in
each
place
this
is
the
master
plan
the
true
follower
of
jesus
has
as
broad
a
horizon
as
his
master
jesus
thought
in
continents
and
seas
his
follower
prays
in
continents
and
seas
this
man
does
not
know
what
is
being
accomplished
yes
he
know
too
he
knows
by
the
inference
of
faith
this
room
where
we
are
meeting
and
talking
together
might
be
shut
up
so
completely
that
no
light
comes
in
a
single
crack
breaking
somewhere
lets
in
a
thin
line
of
light
but
that
line
of
light
shining
in
the
darkness
tells
of
a
whole
sun
of
light
flooding
the
outer
world
there
comes
to
this
man
occasional
yes
frequent
evidences
of
changes
being
wrought
yet
he
knows
that
these
are
but
the
thin
line
of
glory
light
which
speaks
of
the
fuller
shining
and
with
a
spirit
touched
with
glad
awe
that
he
can
and
may
help
god
and
a
heart
full
alike
of
peace
and
of
yearning
and
a
life
fragrant
with
an
unseen
presence
he
goes
steadily
on
his
way
towards
the
dawning
of
the
day
prayer
the
deciding
factor
in
a
spirit
conflict
u
a
prehistoric
in
its
simplest
meaning
prayer
has
to
do
with
a
conflict
rightly
understood
it
is
the
deciding
factor
in
a
spirit
conflict
the
scene
of
the
conflict
is
the
earth
the
purpose
of
the
conflict
is
to
decide
the
control
of
the
earth
and
its
inhabitants
the
conflict
runs
back
into
the
misty
ages
of
the
creation
time
the
rightful
prince
of
the
earth
is
jesus
the
king
son
there
is
a
pretender
prince
who
was
once
rightful
prince
he
was
guilty
of
a
breach
of
trust
but
like
king
saul
after
his
rejection
and
david
anointing
in
his
place
he
has
been
and
is
trying
his
best
by
dint
of
force
to
hold
the
realm
and
oust
the
rightful
ruler
the
rightful
prince
is
seeking
by
utterly
different
means
namely
by
persuasion
to
win
the
world
back
to
its
first
allegiance
he
had
a
fierce
with
the
pretender
and
after
a
series
of
victories
won
the
great
victory
of
the
resurrection
morning
there
is
one
peculiarity
of
this
conflict
making
it
different
from
all
others
namely
a
decided
victory
and
the
utter
vanquishing
of
the
leading
general
has
not
stopped
the
war
and
the
reason
is
remarkable
the
victor
has
a
deep
to
win
not
merely
against
the
enemy
but
men
hearts
by
their
free
and
so
with
marvellous
wisdom
and
courage
the
conflict
is
left
open
for
men
sake
it
is
a
spirit
conflict
the
earth
is
swung
in
a
spirit
atmosphere
there
are
unnumbered
thousands
of
spirit
beings
good
and
evil
tramping
the
earth
surface
and
filling
its
atmosphere
they
are
splendidly
organized
into
two
compact
organizations
man
is
a
spirit
being
an
embodied
spirit
being
he
has
a
body
and
a
mind
he
is
a
spirit
his
real
conflicts
are
of
the
spirit
sort
in
the
spirit
realm
with
other
spirit
beings
satan
is
a
spirit
being
an
unembodied
spirit
being
that
is
unembodied
save
as
in
much
cunning
with
deep
dark
purpose
he
secures
embodiment
in
human
beings
the
only
sort
of
power
that
influences
in
the
spirit
realm
is
power
by
which
is
not
meant
but
that
sort
of
power
either
bad
or
good
which
is
not
of
a
physical
sort
that
higher
infinitely
higher
and
greater
power
than
the
mere
physical
moral
power
is
the
opposite
of
violent
or
physical
power
god
does
not
use
force
violent
physical
force
there
are
some
exceptions
to
this
statement
there
have
been
righteous
wars
righteous
on
one
side
turning
to
the
bible
record
in
emergencies
in
extreme
instances
god
has
ordered
war
measures
the
nations
that
israel
was
told
to
remove
by
the
death
of
war
would
have
inevitably
worn
themselves
out
through
their
physical
excesses
and
disobedience
of
the
laws
of
life
but
a
wide
view
of
the
race
revealed
an
emergency
which
demanded
a
speedier
movement
and
as
an
exception
for
the
sake
of
his
plan
for
the
ultimate
saving
of
a
race
and
a
world
god
gave
an
extermination
order
the
emergency
makes
the
exception
there
is
one
circumstance
under
which
the
taking
of
human
life
is
right
namely
when
it
can
be
clearly
established
that
god
the
giver
and
sovereign
of
life
has
so
directed
but
the
rule
clearly
is
that
god
does
not
use
force
but
note
sharply
in
contrast
with
this
that
physical
force
is
one
of
satan
chief
weapons
but
mark
there
two
intensely
interesting
facts
first
he
can
use
it
only
as
he
secures
man
as
his
ally
and
uses
it
through
him
and
second
in
using
it
he
has
with
great
subtlety
sought
to
shift
the
sphere
of
action
he
knows
that
in
the
sphere
of
spirit
force
pure
and
simple
he
is
at
a
disadvantage
indeed
worse
yet
he
is
defeated
for
there
is
a
moral
force
on
the
other
side
greater
than
any
at
his
command
the
forces
of
purity
and
righteousness
he
simply
withstand
jesus
is
the
personification
of
purity
and
righteousness
it
was
on
this
moral
ground
in
this
spirit
sphere
that
he
won
the
great
victory
he
ran
a
terrific
gauntlet
of
tests
subtle
and
fierce
through
those
human
years
and
came
out
victor
with
his
purity
and
righteousness
unstained
u
prayer
is
projecting
one
spirit
now
prayer
is
a
spirit
force
it
has
to
do
wholly
with
spirit
beings
and
forces
it
is
an
insistent
claiming
by
a
man
an
embodied
spirit
being
down
on
the
contested
earth
that
the
power
of
jesus
victory
over
the
great
chieftain
shall
extend
to
particular
lives
now
under
his
control
the
prayer
takes
on
the
characteristic
of
the
man
praying
he
is
a
spirit
being
it
becomes
a
spirit
force
it
is
a
projecting
into
the
spirit
realm
of
his
spirit
personality
being
a
spirit
force
it
has
certain
qualities
or
characteristics
of
unembodied
spirit
beings
an
unembodied
spirit
being
is
not
limited
by
space
as
we
embodied
folk
are
it
can
go
as
swiftly
as
we
can
think
if
i
want
to
go
to
london
it
will
take
at
least
a
week
time
to
get
my
body
through
the
intervening
space
but
i
can
think
myself
into
london
more
quickly
than
i
can
say
the
words
and
be
walking
down
the
strand
now
a
spirit
being
can
go
as
quickly
as
i
can
think
further
spirit
beings
are
not
limited
by
material
obstructions
such
as
the
walls
of
this
building
when
i
came
in
here
i
came
in
by
this
door
you
all
came
in
by
these
doors
we
were
obliged
to
come
in
either
by
doors
or
windows
but
the
spirit
beings
who
are
here
listening
to
us
and
deeply
concerned
with
our
discussion
did
not
bother
with
the
doors
they
came
in
through
the
walls
or
the
roof
if
they
were
above
us
or
through
the
floor
here
if
they
happened
to
be
below
this
level
prayer
has
these
qualities
of
spirit
beings
of
not
being
limited
by
space
or
by
material
obstacles
prayer
is
really
projecting
my
spirit
that
is
my
real
personality
to
the
spot
concerned
and
doing
business
there
with
other
spirit
beings
for
example
there
is
a
man
in
a
city
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
for
whom
i
pray
daily
it
makes
my
praying
for
him
very
tangible
and
definite
to
recall
that
every
time
i
pray
my
prayer
is
a
spirit
force
instantly
traversing
the
space
in
between
him
and
me
and
going
without
hindrance
through
the
walls
of
the
house
where
he
is
and
influencing
the
spirit
beings
surrounding
him
and
so
influencing
his
own
will
when
it
became
clear
to
me
some
few
years
ago
that
my
master
would
not
have
me
go
yet
to
those
parts
of
the
earth
where
the
need
is
greatest
a
deep
tinge
of
disappointment
came
over
me
then
as
i
realized
the
wisdom
of
his
sovereignty
in
service
it
came
to
me
anew
that
i
could
exert
a
positive
influence
in
those
lands
for
him
by
prayer
as
many
others
have
done
i
marked
out
a
daily
schedule
of
prayer
there
are
certain
ones
for
whom
i
pray
by
name
at
certain
intervals
and
it
gives
great
simplicity
to
my
faith
and
great
gladness
to
my
heart
to
remember
that
every
time
such
prayer
is
breathed
out
my
spirit
personality
is
being
projected
yonder
and
in
effect
i
am
standing
in
shanghai
and
calcutta
and
tokyo
in
turn
and
pleading
the
power
of
jesus
victory
over
the
evil
one
there
and
on
behalf
of
those
faithful
ones
standing
there
for
god
it
is
a
fiercely
contested
conflict
satan
is
a
trained
strategist
and
an
obstinate
fighter
he
refuses
to
acknowledge
defeat
until
he
must
it
is
the
fight
of
his
life
strange
as
it
must
seem
and
perhaps
absurd
he
apparently
hopes
to
succeed
if
we
knew
all
it
might
seem
less
strange
and
absurd
because
of
the
factors
on
his
side
there
is
surely
much
down
in
the
world
of
the
sort
which
we
can
fully
appreciate
to
give
colour
to
his
expectations
prayer
is
insisting
upon
jesus
victory
and
the
retreat
of
the
enemy
on
each
particular
spot
and
heart
and
problem
concerned
the
enemy
yields
only
what
he
must
he
yields
only
what
is
taken
therefore
the
ground
must
be
taken
step
by
step
prayer
must
be
definite
he
yields
only
when
he
must
therefore
the
prayer
must
be
persistent
he
continually
renews
his
attacks
therefore
the
ground
taken
must
be
against
him
in
the
victor
name
this
helps
to
understand
why
prayer
must
be
persisted
in
after
we
have
full
assurance
of
the
result
and
even
after
some
immediate
results
have
come
or
after
the
general
results
have
commenced
coming
u
giving
god
a
fresh
the
victor
best
ally
in
this
conflict
is
the
man
who
while
he
remains
down
on
the
puts
his
life
in
full
touch
with
his
and
then
incessantly
insistently
believingly
claims
in
jesus
he
is
the
one
foe
among
men
whom
satan
can
not
withstand
he
is
projecting
an
irresistible
spirit
force
into
the
spirit
realm
satan
is
obliged
to
yield
we
are
so
accustomed
through
long
record
to
seeing
victories
won
through
force
physical
force
alone
that
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
realize
that
moral
force
defeats
as
the
other
never
can
witness
the
demons
in
the
gospels
and
in
modern
days
in
china
clearly
against
their
own
set
purpose
notwithstanding
intensest
struggle
on
their
part
obliged
to
admit
defeat
and
even
to
ask
favours
of
their
conqueror
the
records
of
personal
christian
service
give
fascinating
instances
of
fierce
opposition
utterly
subdued
and
individuals
transformed
through
such
influence
had
we
eyes
to
see
spirit
beings
and
spirit
conflicts
we
would
constantly
see
the
enemy
defeat
in
numberless
instances
through
the
persistent
praying
of
some
one
allied
to
jesus
in
the
spirit
of
his
life
every
time
such
a
man
prays
it
is
a
waving
of
the
flag
of
jesus
christ
above
satan
head
in
the
spirit
world
every
such
man
who
freely
gives
himself
over
to
god
and
gives
himself
up
to
prayer
is
giving
god
a
new
spot
in
the
contested
territory
on
which
to
erect
his
banner
of
victory
the
japanese
struggled
for
weeks
to
get
a
footing
on
the
port
arthur
peninsula
even
after
the
naval
victories
had
practically
rendered
russia
helpless
on
the
seas
it
was
an
unusual
spectacle
to
witness
such
difficulty
in
getting
a
landing
after
such
victories
but
with
the
bulldog
tenacity
that
has
marked
her
fighting
japan
fought
for
a
footing
nothing
could
be
done
till
a
footing
was
gotten
prayer
is
man
giving
god
a
footing
on
the
contested
territory
of
this
earth
the
man
in
full
touch
of
purpose
with
god
praying
insistently
praying
that
man
is
god
footing
on
the
enemy
soil
the
man
wholly
given
over
to
god
gives
him
a
new
on
the
from
which
to
work
out
and
the
holy
spirit
within
that
man
on
the
new
spot
will
insist
on
the
enemy
retreat
in
jesus
the
victor
name
that
is
prayer
shall
we
not
every
one
of
us
increase
god
footing
down
upon
his
prodigal
earth
the
earth
the
in
prayer
u
prayer
a
war
this
world
is
god
prodigal
son
the
heart
of
god
bleeds
over
his
prodigal
it
has
been
gone
so
long
and
the
home
circle
is
broken
he
has
spent
all
the
wealth
of
his
thought
on
a
plan
for
winning
the
prodigal
back
home
angels
and
men
have
marvelled
over
that
plan
its
sweep
its
detail
its
strength
and
wisdom
its
tenderness
he
needs
man
for
his
plan
he
will
man
that
is
true
he
will
man
in
service
that
is
true
but
these
only
touch
the
edge
of
the
truth
the
pathway
from
god
to
a
human
heart
is
through
a
human
heart
when
he
came
to
the
great
strategic
move
in
his
plan
he
himself
came
down
as
a
man
and
made
that
move
needs
man
for
his
the
greatest
agency
put
into
man
hands
is
prayer
to
understand
that
at
all
fully
one
needs
to
define
prayer
and
to
define
prayer
adequately
one
must
use
the
language
of
war
peace
language
is
not
equal
to
the
situation
the
earth
is
in
a
state
of
war
it
is
being
hotly
besieged
and
so
one
must
use
war
talk
to
grasp
the
facts
with
which
prayer
is
concerned
from
god
side
is
communication
between
himself
and
his
allies
in
the
enemy
prayer
is
not
persuading
god
it
does
not
influence
god
purpose
it
is
not
winning
him
over
to
our
side
never
that
he
is
far
more
eager
for
what
we
are
rightly
eager
for
than
we
ever
are
what
there
is
of
wrong
and
sin
and
suffering
that
pains
you
pains
him
far
more
he
knows
more
about
it
he
is
more
keenly
sensitive
to
it
than
the
most
sensitive
one
of
us
whatever
of
heart
yearning
there
may
be
that
moves
you
to
prayer
is
from
him
god
takes
the
initiative
in
all
prayer
it
starts
with
him
true
prayer
moves
in
a
circle
it
begins
in
the
heart
of
god
sweeps
down
into
a
human
heart
upon
the
earth
so
intersecting
the
circle
of
the
earth
which
is
the
of
prayer
and
then
it
goes
back
again
to
its
starting
point
having
accomplished
its
purpose
on
the
downward
swing
u
three
forms
of
prayer
is
the
word
commonly
used
for
all
intercourse
with
god
but
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
that
word
covers
and
includes
three
forms
of
intercourse
all
prayer
grows
up
through
and
ever
continues
in
three
stages
the
first
form
of
prayer
is
that
is
simply
being
on
good
terms
with
god
it
involves
the
blood
of
the
cross
as
the
basis
of
our
getting
and
being
on
good
terms
it
involves
my
coming
to
god
through
jesus
communion
is
fellowship
with
god
not
request
for
some
particular
thing
not
asking
but
simply
enjoying
himself
loving
him
thinking
about
him
how
beautiful
and
intelligent
and
strong
and
loving
and
lovable
he
is
talking
to
him
without
words
that
is
the
truest
worship
thinking
how
worthy
he
is
of
all
the
best
we
can
possibly
bring
to
him
and
infinitely
more
it
has
to
do
wholly
with
god
and
a
man
being
on
good
terms
with
each
other
of
necessity
it
includes
confession
on
my
part
and
forgiveness
upon
god
part
for
only
so
can
we
come
into
the
relation
of
fellowship
adoration
worship
belong
to
this
first
phase
of
prayer
communion
is
the
basis
of
all
prayer
it
is
the
essential
breath
of
the
true
christian
life
it
concerns
just
two
god
and
myself
yourself
its
influence
is
directly
subjective
affects
the
second
form
of
prayer
is
and
i
am
using
that
word
now
in
the
narrower
meaning
of
asking
something
for
one
self
petition
is
definite
request
of
god
for
something
i
need
a
man
whole
life
is
utterly
dependent
upon
the
giving
hand
of
god
everything
we
need
comes
from
him
our
friendships
ability
to
make
money
health
strength
in
temptation
and
in
sorrow
guidance
in
difficult
circumstances
and
in
all
of
life
movements
help
of
all
sorts
financial
bodily
mental
spiritual
all
come
from
god
and
necessitate
a
constant
touch
with
him
there
needs
to
be
a
constant
stream
of
petition
going
up
many
times
wordless
prayer
and
there
will
be
a
constant
return
stream
of
answer
and
supply
coming
down
the
door
between
god
and
one
own
self
must
be
kept
ever
open
the
knob
to
be
turned
is
on
our
side
he
opened
his
side
long
ago
and
propped
it
open
and
threw
the
knob
away
the
whole
life
hinges
upon
this
continual
intercourse
with
our
wondrous
god
this
is
the
second
stage
or
form
of
prayer
it
concerns
just
two
god
and
the
man
dealing
with
god
it
is
subjective
in
its
influence
reach
is
the
third
form
of
prayer
is
true
prayer
never
stops
with
petition
for
one
self
it
reaches
out
for
others
the
very
word
intercession
implies
a
reaching
out
for
some
one
else
it
is
standing
as
a
a
mutual
friend
between
god
and
some
one
who
is
either
out
of
touch
with
him
or
is
needing
special
help
intercession
is
the
climax
of
prayer
it
is
the
outward
drive
of
prayer
it
is
the
effective
end
of
prayer
communion
and
petition
are
upward
and
downward
intercession
rests
upon
these
two
as
its
foundation
communion
and
petition
store
the
life
with
the
power
of
god
intercession
lets
it
out
on
behalf
of
others
the
first
two
are
necessarily
for
self
this
third
is
for
others
they
ally
a
man
fully
with
god
it
makes
use
of
that
alliance
for
others
intercession
is
the
plant
whose
roots
and
strength
lie
back
and
down
in
the
other
two
forms
is
the
form
of
prayer
that
helps
god
in
his
great
for
winning
a
planet
back
to
its
true
sphere
it
will
help
through
these
talks
to
keep
this
simple
analysis
of
prayer
in
mind
for
much
that
will
be
said
will
deal
chiefly
with
this
third
form
intercession
the
outward
movement
of
prayer
u
the
climax
of
to
god
man
is
first
an
objective
point
and
then
without
ceasing
to
be
that
he
further
becomes
a
distributing
centre
god
ever
thinks
of
a
man
doubly
first
for
his
own
self
and
then
for
his
possible
use
in
reaching
others
communion
and
petition
fix
and
continue
one
relation
to
god
and
so
prepare
for
the
great
outreaching
form
of
prayer
intercession
prayer
must
begin
in
the
first
two
but
reaches
its
climax
in
the
third
communion
and
petition
are
of
necessity
intercession
is
in
its
reach
and
all
true
rounded
prayer
will
ever
have
all
three
elements
in
it
there
must
be
the
touch
with
god
one
constant
needs
make
constant
petition
but
the
heart
of
the
true
follower
has
caught
the
warm
contagion
of
the
heart
of
god
and
reaches
out
hungrily
for
the
world
intercession
is
the
climax
of
prayer
much
is
said
of
the
subjective
and
objective
value
of
prayer
its
influence
upon
one
self
and
its
possible
influence
upon
persons
and
events
quite
outside
of
one
self
of
necessity
the
first
two
sorts
of
prayer
here
named
are
subjective
they
have
to
do
wholly
with
one
self
of
equal
necessity
intercessory
prayer
is
objective
it
has
to
do
wholly
with
others
there
is
even
here
a
reflex
influence
in
the
first
two
directly
subjective
here
incidentally
reflex
contact
with
god
while
dealing
with
him
for
another
of
necessity
influences
me
but
that
is
the
mere
fringe
of
the
garment
the
main
driving
purpose
is
outward
just
now
in
certain
circles
it
seems
quite
the
thing
to
lay
great
stress
upon
the
subjective
value
of
prayer
and
to
whittle
down
small
or
deny
entirely
its
value
in
influencing
others
some
who
have
the
popular
ear
are
quite
free
with
tongue
and
pen
in
this
direction
from
both
without
and
within
distinctly
christian
circles
their
voices
come
one
wonders
if
these
friends
lay
the
greater
emphasis
on
the
subjective
value
of
prayer
so
as
to
get
a
good
deep
breath
for
their
hard
drive
at
the
other
yet
the
greater
probability
is
that
they
honestly
believe
as
they
say
but
have
failed
to
grasp
the
full
perspective
of
the
picture
in
listening
to
such
statements
one
remembers
with
vivid
distinctness
that
the
scriptural
always
is
this
that
things
quite
outside
of
one
self
that
in
the
natural
order
of
prevailing
circumstances
would
not
occur
are
made
to
occur
through
prayer
jesus
constantly
so
the
commonsense
view
of
successful
prayer
is
that
some
actual
result
is
secured
through
its
agency
it
is
an
utter
begging
of
the
question
to
advance
such
a
theory
as
a
sufficient
explanation
of
prayer
for
prayer
in
its
simplest
conception
supposes
something
changed
that
is
not
otherwise
reachable
both
from
the
scriptural
and
from
a
rugged
philosophical
standpoint
the
objective
is
the
real
driving
point
of
all
full
prayer
the
subjective
is
in
order
to
the
objective
as
the
final
outward
climactic
reach
of
god
great
for
a
world
u
six
facts
underlying
it
will
help
greatly
to
step
back
and
up
a
bit
for
a
fresh
look
at
certain
facts
that
underlie
prayer
everything
depends
on
a
right
point
of
view
there
may
be
many
from
which
to
study
any
subject
but
of
necessity
any
one
must
take
in
all
the
essential
facts
concerned
if
not
the
impression
formed
will
be
wrong
and
a
man
will
be
misled
in
his
actions
in
these
talks
i
make
no
attempt
to
prove
the
bible
statements
nor
to
suggest
a
common
law
for
their
interpretation
that
would
be
a
matter
for
quite
a
separate
series
of
talks
it
clears
the
ground
to
assume
certain
things
i
am
assuming
the
accuracy
of
these
scriptural
statements
and
i
am
glad
to
say
i
have
no
difficulty
in
doing
so
now
there
are
certain
facts
constantly
stated
and
assumed
in
this
old
book
they
are
clearly
stated
in
its
history
they
are
woven
into
its
songs
and
they
underlie
all
these
prophetic
writings
from
genesis
clear
to
the
end
of
john
patmos
visions
possibly
they
have
been
so
familiar
and
taken
for
granted
so
long
as
to
have
grown
unfamiliar
the
very
old
may
need
stating
as
though
very
new
here
is
a
chain
of
six
facts
first
the
earth
is
the
lord
and
the
fullness
thereof
his
by
creation
and
by
sovereign
rule
the
lord
sat
as
king
at
the
flood
second
god
gave
the
dominion
of
the
earth
to
man
the
kingship
of
its
life
the
control
and
mastery
of
its
forces
third
man
who
held
the
dominion
of
the
earth
in
trust
from
god
transferred
his
dominion
to
somebody
else
by
an
act
which
was
a
double
act
he
was
deceived
into
doing
that
act
it
was
an
act
of
disobedience
and
of
obedience
disobedience
to
god
and
obedience
to
another
one
a
prince
who
was
seeking
to
get
the
dominion
of
the
earth
into
his
own
hands
that
act
of
the
first
man
did
this
the
disobedience
broke
with
god
and
transferred
the
allegiance
from
god
the
obedience
to
the
other
one
transferred
the
allegiance
and
through
that
the
dominion
to
this
other
one
the
fourth
fact
is
this
the
dominion
or
kingship
of
this
earth
so
far
as
given
to
man
is
now
not
god
for
he
gave
it
to
man
and
it
is
not
man
for
he
has
transferred
it
to
another
it
is
in
the
control
of
that
magnificent
prince
whose
changed
character
supplies
his
name
satan
the
hater
the
enemy
jesus
repeatedly
speaks
of
the
prince
that
is
the
ruling
one
of
this
world
john
speaks
in
his
of
a
time
coming
when
the
kingdom
not
kingdoms
as
in
the
old
version
of
the
world
is
become
the
kingdom
of
our
lord
and
of
his
christ
by
clear
inference
previous
to
that
time
it
is
somebody
else
kingdom
than
his
the
kingship
or
rulership
of
the
earth
which
was
given
to
man
is
now
satan
the
fifth
fact
god
was
eager
to
swing
the
world
back
to
its
original
sway
for
his
own
sake
for
man
sake
for
the
earth
sake
you
see
we
do
not
know
god
world
as
it
came
from
his
hand
it
is
a
rarely
beautiful
world
even
yet
the
stars
above
the
plant
life
the
waters
the
exquisite
colouring
and
blending
the
combinations
of
all
these
an
exquisitely
beautiful
world
even
yet
but
it
is
not
the
world
it
was
nor
that
some
coming
day
it
will
be
it
has
been
sadly
scarred
and
changed
under
its
present
ruler
probably
eve
would
not
recognize
in
the
present
world
her
early
as
it
came
fresh
from
the
hand
of
its
maker
god
was
eager
to
swing
the
old
world
back
to
its
original
control
but
to
do
so
he
must
get
a
man
one
of
the
original
trustee
class
through
whom
he
might
swing
it
back
to
its
first
allegiance
it
was
given
to
man
it
was
swung
away
by
man
it
must
be
swung
back
by
man
and
so
a
man
came
and
while
jesus
was
perfectly
and
utterly
human
we
spell
that
word
man
with
a
capital
m
because
he
was
a
man
quite
distinct
from
all
men
because
he
was
more
truly
human
than
all
other
men
he
is
quite
apart
from
other
men
this
man
was
to
head
a
movement
for
swinging
the
world
back
to
its
first
allegiance
the
sixth
fact
is
this
these
two
god
man
and
the
had
a
combat
the
most
terrific
combat
ever
waged
or
witnessed
from
the
cruel
malicious
cradle
attack
until
calvary
morning
and
two
days
longer
it
ran
through
those
years
it
continued
with
a
terrificness
and
intensity
unknown
before
or
since
the
of
subtlety
and
force
did
his
best
and
his
worst
through
those
nazareth
years
then
into
the
wilderness
and
gethsemane
and
calvary
and
that
day
at
three
and
for
a
bit
longer
the
evil
one
thought
he
had
won
and
there
was
great
glee
up
in
the
headquarters
of
the
prince
of
this
world
they
thought
the
victory
was
theirs
when
god
man
lay
in
the
grave
under
the
bars
of
death
within
the
immediate
control
of
the
lord
of
death
but
the
third
morning
came
and
the
bars
of
death
were
snapped
like
cotton
thread
rose
a
for
it
was
not
possible
that
such
as
could
be
held
by
death
lord
and
then
satan
knew
that
he
was
defeated
jesus
god
man
the
king
rightful
prince
had
gotten
the
victory
but
please
mark
very
carefully
four
on
satan
side
first
he
refuses
to
acknowledge
his
defeat
second
he
refuses
to
surrender
his
dominion
until
he
must
he
yields
only
what
he
must
and
when
he
must
third
he
is
supported
in
his
ambitions
by
man
he
has
man
consent
to
his
control
the
majority
of
men
on
the
earth
and
in
every
day
have
assented
to
his
control
he
has
control
only
through
man
consent
satan
get
into
a
man
heart
without
his
consent
and
god
not
and
fourth
he
hopes
yet
to
make
his
possession
of
the
earth
permanent
u
the
victor
great
now
hold
your
breath
and
note
on
the
side
of
the
this
unparalleled
and
unimitated
action
he
has
left
the
conflict
open
and
the
defeated
chief
on
the
field
that
he
may
win
not
simply
against
the
chief
but
through
that
victory
may
win
the
whole
prodigal
race
back
to
his
father
home
circle
again
but
the
great
pitched
battle
is
yet
to
come
i
would
better
say
pitched
battle
for
the
greatest
one
is
past
jesus
rides
into
the
future
fight
a
victor
satan
will
fight
his
last
fight
under
the
shadow
and
sting
of
a
defeat
satan
is
apparently
trying
hard
to
get
a
jesus
that
is
to
say
jesus
was
god
man
sent
down
to
swing
the
world
back
satan
is
trying
his
best
to
get
one
of
the
original
trustee
class
to
whom
the
dominion
of
the
earth
was
intrusted
a
man
who
will
stand
for
him
even
as
jesus
stood
for
god
indeed
a
man
who
will
personify
himself
even
as
jesus
was
the
personification
of
god
the
express
image
of
his
person
when
he
shall
succeed
in
that
the
last
desperate
crisis
will
come
prayer
is
this
a
one
of
the
original
trustee
class
who
received
the
earth
in
trust
from
god
and
who
gave
its
control
over
to
satan
a
man
the
the
poor
old
contested
earth
a
man
on
the
earth
his
life
in
full
touch
with
the
victor
and
sheer
out
of
touch
with
the
insistently
claiming
that
satan
shall
yield
before
step
by
step
life
after
jesus
is
the
victor
satan
knows
it
and
fears
him
he
must
yield
before
his
advance
and
he
must
yield
before
this
man
who
stands
for
jesus
down
on
the
earth
and
he
yield
reluctantly
angrily
as
slowly
as
may
be
stubbornly
contesting
every
inch
of
ground
his
clutches
will
loosen
and
he
will
go
before
this
jesus
said
the
prince
of
the
world
cometh
and
he
hath
nothing
in
me
when
you
and
i
say
as
we
may
say
very
humbly
depending
on
his
grace
very
determinedly
in
the
resolution
of
our
own
imperial
will
though
the
prince
of
this
world
come
he
shall
have
nothing
in
me
no
coaling
station
however
small
on
the
shores
of
my
life
then
we
shall
be
in
position
where
satan
must
yield
as
we
claim
victory
in
the
victor
name
does
prayer
influence
god
u
how
god
some
one
may
object
to
all
this
that
the
statements
of
god
word
do
not
agree
with
this
point
of
view
at
random
memory
brings
up
a
few
very
familiar
passages
frequently
quoted
call
unto
me
and
i
will
answer
thee
and
will
shew
thee
great
things
and
difficult
that
thou
knowest
not
and
call
upon
me
in
the
day
of
trouble
i
will
deliver
thee
and
thou
shalt
glorify
me
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
here
it
seems
as
we
have
for
generations
been
accustomed
to
think
that
our
asking
is
the
thing
that
influences
god
to
do
and
further
that
many
times
persistent
continued
asking
is
necessary
to
induce
god
to
do
and
the
usual
explanation
for
this
need
of
persistence
is
that
god
is
testing
our
faith
and
seeking
to
make
certain
changes
in
us
before
granting
our
requests
this
explanation
is
without
doubt
quite
true
yet
the
thing
to
mark
is
that
it
explains
in
part
and
when
the
whole
circle
of
truth
is
brought
into
view
this
explanation
is
found
to
cover
only
a
small
part
of
the
whole
we
seem
to
learn
best
about
god
by
analogies
the
analogy
never
brings
all
there
is
to
be
learned
yet
it
seems
to
be
the
nearest
we
can
get
from
what
we
know
of
ourselves
we
come
to
know
him
will
you
notice
how
men
give
among
those
who
give
to
benevolent
enterprises
there
are
three
sorts
of
givers
with
variations
in
each
there
is
the
man
who
gives
because
he
is
influenced
by
others
if
the
right
man
or
committee
of
men
call
and
deftly
present
their
pleas
playing
skillfully
upon
what
may
appeal
to
him
his
position
his
egotism
the
possible
advantage
to
accrue
what
men
whom
he
wants
to
be
classed
with
are
doing
and
so
on
through
the
wide
range
that
such
men
are
familiar
with
if
they
persist
by
and
by
he
gives
at
first
he
seems
reluctant
but
finally
gives
with
more
or
less
grace
that
is
one
sort
of
giver
there
is
a
second
sort
the
man
of
truly
benevolent
heart
who
is
desirous
of
giving
that
he
may
be
of
help
to
other
men
he
listens
attentively
when
pleas
come
to
him
and
waits
only
long
enough
to
satisfy
himself
of
the
worth
of
the
cause
and
the
proper
sort
of
amount
to
give
and
then
gives
there
is
a
third
sort
the
rarest
sort
this
second
man
a
stage
farther
on
who
the
he
looks
about
him
makes
inquiries
and
thinks
over
the
great
need
in
every
direction
of
his
fellow
men
he
decides
where
his
money
may
best
be
used
to
help
and
then
himself
offers
to
give
but
his
gift
may
be
abused
by
some
who
would
get
his
money
if
they
could
and
use
it
injudiciously
or
otherwise
than
he
intends
so
he
makes
certain
conditions
which
must
be
met
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
establish
sympathetic
relations
in
some
particular
with
those
whom
he
would
help
an
englishman
heart
is
strongly
moved
to
get
the
story
of
jesus
to
the
inland
millions
of
chinese
he
requests
the
mission
to
control
the
expenditure
of
almost
a
million
dollars
of
his
money
in
such
a
way
as
best
to
secure
the
object
in
his
heart
an
american
gives
a
large
sum
to
the
young
men
christian
association
of
his
home
city
to
be
expended
as
directed
his
thought
is
not
to
build
up
this
particular
organization
but
to
benefit
large
numbers
of
the
young
men
of
his
town
who
will
meet
certain
conditions
which
he
thinks
to
be
for
their
good
he
has
learned
to
trust
this
organization
and
so
it
becomes
his
trustee
another
man
feels
that
if
the
people
of
new
york
city
can
be
given
good
reading
they
can
thereby
best
be
helped
in
life
and
so
he
volunteers
money
for
a
number
of
libraries
throughout
that
city
and
thousands
who
yearn
to
increase
their
knowledge
come
into
sympathy
with
him
in
that
one
point
through
his
gift
in
all
such
cases
the
giver
thought
is
to
accomplish
certain
results
in
those
whose
purpose
in
certain
directions
is
sympathetic
with
his
own
any
human
illustration
of
god
must
seem
crude
yet
of
these
three
sorts
of
givers
there
is
one
and
only
one
that
begins
to
suggest
how
god
gives
it
may
seem
like
a
very
sweeping
statement
to
make
yet
i
am
more
and
more
disposed
to
believe
it
true
that
have
unthinkingly
thought
of
god
answering
prayer
as
the
first
of
these
three
men
give
many
others
have
had
in
mind
some
such
thought
as
the
second
suggests
yet
to
state
the
case
even
thus
definitely
is
to
make
it
plain
that
neither
of
these
ways
in
any
manner
illustrate
god
giving
the
third
comes
the
nearest
to
picturing
the
god
who
hears
and
answers
prayer
our
god
has
a
great
heart
yearning
after
his
poor
prodigal
world
and
after
each
one
in
it
he
longs
to
have
the
effects
of
sin
removed
and
the
original
image
restored
he
takes
the
initiative
yet
everything
that
is
done
for
man
must
of
necessity
be
through
man
will
by
his
free
and
glad
consent
the
obstacles
in
the
way
are
not
numberless
nor
insurmountable
but
they
are
many
and
they
are
stubborn
there
is
a
keen
cunning
who
is
a
in
the
fine
art
of
handling
men
there
are
wills
warped
and
weakened
consciences
blurred
minds
the
opposite
of
keen
sensibilities
whose
edge
has
been
dulled
beyond
ordinary
hope
of
being
ever
made
keen
again
sin
has
not
only
stained
the
life
but
warped
the
judgment
sapped
the
will
and
blurred
the
mental
vision
and
god
has
a
hard
time
just
because
every
change
must
of
necessity
be
through
that
sapped
and
warped
will
yet
the
difficulty
though
great
is
never
complex
but
very
simple
and
so
the
statement
of
his
purpose
is
ever
exquisitely
simple
listen
again
call
unto
me
and
i
will
answer
thee
and
shew
thee
great
things
and
difficult
which
thou
knowest
not
if
a
man
call
he
has
already
turned
his
face
towards
god
his
will
has
acted
and
acted
doubly
away
from
the
opposite
and
god
a
simple
step
but
a
tremendous
one
the
calling
is
the
point
of
sympathetic
contact
with
god
where
their
purposes
become
the
same
the
caller
is
beset
by
difficulties
and
longs
for
freedom
the
god
who
speaks
to
him
saw
the
difficulties
long
ago
and
eagerly
longed
to
remove
them
now
they
have
come
to
agreement
and
through
this
willing
will
god
eagerly
works
out
his
purpose
u
a
very
old
this
leads
to
a
very
old
question
does
prayer
influence
god
no
question
has
been
discussed
more
or
more
earnestly
skeptical
men
of
fine
scientific
training
have
with
great
positiveness
said
no
and
christian
men
of
scholarly
training
and
strong
faith
have
with
equal
positiveness
said
yes
strange
to
say
both
have
been
right
not
right
in
all
their
statements
nor
right
in
all
their
beliefs
nor
right
in
all
their
processes
of
thinking
but
right
in
their
ultimate
conclusions
as
represented
by
these
short
words
no
and
yes
prayer
does
not
influence
god
prayer
surely
does
influence
god
it
does
not
influence
his
purpose
it
does
influence
his
action
everything
that
ever
has
been
prayed
for
of
course
i
mean
every
right
thing
god
has
already
purposed
to
do
but
he
does
nothing
without
our
consent
he
has
been
hindered
in
his
purposes
by
our
lack
of
willingness
when
we
learn
his
purposes
and
make
them
our
prayers
we
are
giving
him
the
opportunity
to
act
it
is
a
double
opportunity
manward
and
satanward
we
are
willing
our
willingness
checkmates
satan
opposition
it
opens
the
path
to
god
and
rids
it
of
the
obstacles
and
so
the
road
is
cleared
for
the
free
action
already
planned
the
further
question
of
nature
laws
being
sometimes
set
aside
is
wholly
a
secondary
matter
nature
laws
are
merely
god
habit
of
action
in
handling
secondary
forces
they
involve
no
purpose
of
god
his
purposes
are
regarding
moral
issues
that
the
sun
shall
stay
a
bit
longer
than
usual
over
a
certain
part
of
the
earth
is
a
mere
detail
with
god
it
does
not
affect
his
power
for
the
whole
affair
is
under
his
finger
it
does
not
affect
his
purpose
for
that
as
concerning
far
more
serious
matters
the
emergencies
of
earth
wrought
by
sin
necessitate
just
such
incidents
that
the
great
purpose
of
god
for
man
shall
be
accomplished
emergencies
change
all
habits
of
action
divine
and
human
they
are
the
real
test
of
power
if
a
man
throw
down
the
bundle
he
is
carrying
and
make
a
quick
wild
dash
out
into
the
middle
of
the
street
dropping
his
hat
on
the
way
and
grasp
convulsively
for
something
on
the
ground
when
no
cause
appears
for
such
action
we
would
quickly
conclude
that
the
proper
place
for
him
is
an
asylum
but
if
a
little
toddling
child
is
almost
under
the
horse
hoofs
or
the
trolley
car
no
one
thinks
of
criticising
but
instead
admires
his
courage
and
quick
action
and
breathlessly
watches
for
the
result
emergencies
call
for
special
action
they
should
control
actions
where
they
exist
emergencies
explain
action
and
explain
satisfactorily
what
nothing
else
could
explain
world
is
in
a
great
emergency
through
only
as
that
tremendous
fact
grips
us
shall
we
be
men
of
prayer
and
men
of
action
up
to
the
limit
of
the
need
and
to
the
limit
of
the
possibilities
only
as
that
intense
fact
is
kept
in
mind
shall
we
begin
to
understand
god
actions
in
history
and
in
our
personal
experiences
the
greatest
event
of
earth
the
cross
was
an
emergency
action
the
fact
that
prayer
does
not
make
any
change
in
god
thought
or
purpose
reveals
his
marvellous
love
in
a
very
tender
way
suppose
i
want
something
very
much
and
as
well
as
want
and
i
go
to
god
and
ask
for
it
and
suppose
he
is
reluctant
about
giving
had
not
thought
about
giving
me
that
thing
and
rather
hesitates
but
i
am
insistent
and
plead
and
persist
and
by
and
by
god
is
impressed
with
my
earnestness
and
sees
that
i
really
need
the
thing
and
answers
my
prayer
and
gives
me
what
i
ask
is
not
that
a
loving
god
so
to
listen
and
yield
to
my
plea
surely
how
many
times
just
such
an
instance
has
taken
place
between
a
child
and
his
father
or
mother
and
the
child
thinks
to
himself
how
loving
father
is
he
has
given
me
the
thing
i
asked
for
but
suppose
god
is
thinking
about
me
all
the
time
and
planning
with
for
me
and
longing
to
give
me
much
that
he
has
yet
in
his
wisdom
he
does
not
give
because
i
do
not
know
my
own
need
and
have
not
opened
my
hand
to
receive
yes
and
further
yet
likely
as
not
not
knowing
my
need
i
might
abuse
or
misuse
or
fail
to
use
something
given
before
i
had
felt
the
need
of
it
and
now
i
come
to
see
and
feel
that
need
and
come
and
ask
and
he
delighted
with
the
change
in
me
eagerly
gives
tell
me
is
not
that
a
very
much
more
loving
god
than
the
other
conception
suggests
the
truth
is
is
god
jesus
says
your
father
knoweth
what
things
ye
have
need
of
ye
and
he
is
a
father
and
with
god
the
word
father
means
mother
too
then
what
he
we
need
he
has
to
give
the
great
question
for
me
then
in
praying
for
some
personal
thing
is
this
do
know
what
knows
i
need
am
i
thinking
about
what
he
is
thinking
about
for
me
and
then
remember
that
god
is
so
much
more
in
his
loving
planning
than
the
wisest
most
loving
father
we
know
does
a
mother
think
into
her
needs
the
food
and
clothing
and
the
extras
too
the
luxuries
that
is
god
only
he
is
more
loving
and
wiser
than
the
best
of
us
i
have
sometimes
thought
this
that
if
god
were
to
say
to
me
i
want
to
give
you
something
as
a
special
an
extra
because
i
love
you
what
would
you
like
to
have
do
you
know
i
have
thought
i
would
say
dear
god
choose
choose
what
choose
he
is
thinking
about
me
he
knows
what
i
am
thinking
of
and
what
i
would
most
enjoy
and
he
is
such
a
that
he
would
choose
something
just
a
bit
finer
than
i
would
think
i
might
be
thinking
of
a
dollar
but
likely
as
not
he
is
thinking
of
a
double
eagle
i
am
thinking
of
blackberries
big
juicy
blackberries
but
really
i
do
not
know
what
blackberries
are
beside
the
sort
he
knows
and
would
choose
for
me
that
is
our
god
prayer
does
not
and
can
not
change
the
purpose
of
such
a
god
for
every
right
and
good
thing
we
might
ask
for
he
has
already
planned
to
give
us
but
prayer
does
change
the
action
of
god
because
he
can
not
give
against
our
wills
and
our
willingness
as
expressed
by
our
asking
gives
him
the
opportunity
to
do
as
he
has
already
planned
u
the
greatest
there
is
a
greatest
prayer
greatest
that
can
be
offered
it
is
the
substratum
of
every
true
prayer
it
is
the
undercurrent
in
the
stream
of
all
prayer
jesus
himself
gives
it
to
us
in
the
only
form
of
prayer
he
left
for
our
use
it
is
small
in
size
but
mighty
in
power
four
words
thy
will
be
done
let
us
draw
up
our
chairs
and
it
over
mentally
that
its
strength
and
fragrance
may
come
up
into
our
nostrils
and
fill
our
very
beings
that
is
god
on
one
side
he
is
wise
with
all
of
the
intellectual
strength
and
keenness
and
poised
judgment
that
that
word
among
men
brings
to
us
on
another
side
he
is
strong
with
all
that
that
word
can
imply
of
might
and
power
irresistible
on
still
another
side
he
is
good
pure
holy
with
the
finest
thought
those
words
ever
suggest
to
us
in
those
whom
we
know
best
or
in
our
dreams
and
visions
then
on
a
side
remaining
the
tender
personal
side
he
is
loving
no
that
is
quite
inadequate
he
is
its
personification
is
he
now
remember
that
we
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
those
words
our
best
definition
and
thought
of
them
even
in
our
dreams
when
we
let
ourselves
out
but
hang
around
the
outskirts
the
heart
of
them
we
do
not
know
those
words
mean
infinitely
more
than
we
think
their
meaning
is
a
projection
along
the
lines
of
our
thought
of
them
but
measurelessly
beyond
our
highest
reach
and
then
this
god
wise
strong
good
and
love
kin
to
we
belong
to
him
we
are
his
flock
he
doth
us
feed
and
for
his
sheep
he
doth
us
take
we
are
his
children
by
creation
and
by
a
new
creation
in
jesus
christ
he
is
ours
by
his
own
act
that
is
the
thy
a
god
wise
strong
pure
who
is
love
and
who
is
a
and
is
god
thy
god
will
is
his
desires
his
purposes
that
which
he
wishes
to
occur
and
that
to
which
he
gives
his
strength
that
it
may
occur
the
earth
is
his
creation
men
are
his
children
judging
from
wise
loving
parents
among
men
he
has
given
himself
to
thinking
and
studying
and
planning
for
all
men
and
every
man
and
for
the
earth
his
plan
is
the
most
wise
pure
loving
plan
that
can
be
thought
of
it
takes
in
the
whole
sweep
of
our
lives
and
every
detail
of
them
nothing
escapes
the
of
our
god
what
be
so
vigilant
and
keen
as
love
hate
the
exact
reverse
comes
the
nearest
it
is
ever
the
extremes
that
meet
but
hate
can
not
come
up
to
love
for
keen
watchfulness
at
every
turn
health
strength
home
loved
ones
friendships
money
guidance
protecting
care
the
necessities
the
extras
that
love
ever
thinks
of
service
all
these
are
included
in
god
loving
thought
for
us
that
is
his
will
it
is
modified
by
the
degree
of
our
consent
and
further
modified
by
the
circumstances
of
our
lives
life
has
become
a
badly
tangled
skein
of
threads
god
with
infinite
patience
and
skill
is
at
work
untangling
and
bringing
the
best
possible
out
of
the
tangle
what
is
absolutely
best
is
rarely
relatively
best
that
which
is
best
in
itself
is
usually
not
best
under
certain
circumstances
with
human
lives
in
the
balance
god
has
fathomless
skill
and
measureless
patience
and
a
love
utterly
beyond
both
he
is
ever
working
out
the
best
thing
possible
under
every
circumstance
he
could
oftentimes
do
more
and
do
it
in
much
less
time
if
our
human
wills
were
more
pliant
to
his
he
can
be
trusted
and
of
course
means
in
the
darkest
where
you
can
not
see
and
trust
means
trust
it
does
not
mean
test
where
you
trust
you
do
not
test
where
you
test
you
do
not
trust
making
this
our
prayer
means
trusting
god
that
is
god
and
that
his
will
and
that
the
meaning
of
our
offering
this
prayer
thy
will
a
man
will
is
the
man
in
action
within
the
limits
of
his
power
god
will
for
man
is
himself
in
action
within
the
limits
of
our
cooperation
is
a
verb
an
in
the
passive
voice
it
takes
some
form
of
the
verb
to
be
to
express
the
passive
voice
of
any
it
takes
the
intensest
activity
of
will
to
put
this
passive
voice
into
human
action
the
greatest
strength
is
revealed
in
intelligent
yielding
here
the
prayer
is
expressing
the
utter
willingness
of
a
man
that
god
will
shall
be
done
in
him
and
through
him
a
man
never
his
will
unless
indeed
he
lose
his
manhood
but
here
he
makes
that
will
as
strong
as
it
can
be
made
as
a
bit
of
steel
better
like
the
strong
oak
strong
enough
to
sway
and
bend
in
the
wind
then
he
uses
all
its
strength
in
becoming
passive
to
a
higher
will
and
that
too
when
the
purpose
of
that
higher
will
is
not
clear
to
his
own
limited
knowledge
and
understanding
thy
will
be
that
is
be
accomplished
be
brought
to
pass
the
word
stands
for
the
action
in
its
perfected
finished
state
thy
will
be
fully
accomplished
in
its
whole
sweep
and
in
all
its
items
it
speaks
not
only
the
earnest
desire
of
the
heart
praying
but
the
set
purpose
that
everything
in
the
life
is
held
subject
to
the
doing
of
this
purpose
of
god
it
means
that
surrender
of
purpose
that
has
utterly
changed
the
lives
of
the
strongest
men
in
order
that
the
purpose
of
god
might
be
dominant
it
cut
off
from
a
great
throne
earth
greatest
jurist
the
hebrew
lawgiver
and
led
him
instead
to
be
allied
to
a
race
of
slaves
it
led
that
intellectual
giant
jeremiah
from
an
easy
enjoyable
leadership
to
espouse
a
despised
cause
and
so
be
himself
despised
it
led
paul
from
the
leadership
of
his
generation
in
a
great
nation
to
untold
suffering
and
to
a
block
and
an
ax
it
led
jesus
the
very
son
of
god
away
from
a
kingship
to
a
cross
in
every
generation
it
has
radically
changed
lives
and
thy
will
be
done
is
the
great
dominant
that
has
been
the
pathway
of
god
in
all
his
great
doings
among
men
that
will
is
being
done
everywhere
else
in
god
great
world
of
worlds
save
on
the
earth
and
that
portion
of
the
spirit
world
allied
to
this
earth
everywhere
else
there
is
the
perfect
music
of
harmony
with
will
here
only
is
heard
the
harsh
discordant
note
with
this
prayer
go
two
clauses
that
really
particularize
and
explain
it
they
are
included
in
it
and
are
added
to
make
more
clear
the
full
intent
the
first
of
these
clauses
gives
the
sweep
of
his
will
in
its
broadest
outlines
the
second
touches
the
opposition
to
that
will
both
for
our
individual
lives
and
for
the
race
and
the
earth
the
first
clause
is
this
thy
kingdom
come
in
both
of
these
short
sentences
thy
will
be
done
thy
kingdom
come
the
emphatic
word
is
thy
that
word
is
set
in
sharpest
possible
contrast
here
there
is
another
kingdom
now
on
the
earth
there
is
another
will
being
done
this
other
kingdom
must
go
if
god
kingdom
is
to
come
these
kingdoms
are
antagonistic
at
every
point
of
contact
they
are
rivals
for
the
same
allegiance
and
the
same
territory
they
can
not
exist
together
charles
ii
and
cromwell
can
not
remain
in
london
together
thy
kingdom
come
of
necessity
includes
this
the
other
kingdom
go
thy
kingdom
come
means
likewise
thy
king
come
for
in
the
nature
of
things
there
can
not
be
a
kingdom
without
a
king
that
means
again
by
the
same
inference
the
other
prince
go
the
one
who
makes
pretensions
to
being
rightful
heir
to
the
throne
thy
will
be
done
includes
by
the
same
inference
this
the
other
will
be
undone
this
is
the
first
great
explanatory
clause
to
be
connected
with
this
greatest
prayer
thy
kingdom
come
it
gives
the
sweep
of
god
will
in
its
broadest
outlines
the
second
clause
included
in
the
prayer
and
added
to
make
clear
the
swing
of
action
is
this
deliver
us
from
the
evil
one
these
two
sentences
thy
will
be
done
and
deliver
us
from
the
evil
one
are
naturally
connected
each
statement
includes
the
other
to
have
god
will
fully
done
in
us
means
emancipation
from
every
influence
of
the
evil
one
either
direct
or
indirect
or
by
hereditary
taint
to
be
delivered
from
the
evil
one
means
that
every
thought
and
plan
of
god
for
our
lives
shall
be
fully
carried
out
there
are
the
two
great
wills
at
work
in
the
world
ever
clashing
in
the
action
of
history
and
in
our
individual
lives
in
many
of
us
aye
in
all
of
us
though
in
greatly
varying
degree
these
two
wills
constantly
clash
man
is
the
real
the
pitch
of
the
battle
is
in
his
will
god
will
not
do
his
will
in
a
man
without
the
man
will
consenting
and
satan
can
not
at
the
root
the
one
thing
that
works
against
god
will
is
the
evil
one
will
and
on
the
other
hand
the
one
thing
that
effectively
thwarts
satan
plans
is
a
man
wholly
given
up
to
god
will
the
greatest
prayer
then
fully
expressed
sweeps
first
the
whole
field
of
action
then
touches
the
heart
of
the
action
and
then
attacks
the
opposition
it
is
this
thy
kingdom
come
thy
will
be
done
deliver
us
from
the
evil
one
every
true
prayer
ever
offered
comes
under
this
simple
comprehensive
prayer
it
may
be
offered
it
offered
with
an
infinite
variety
of
detail
it
is
greatest
because
of
its
sweep
it
includes
all
other
petitions
for
god
will
includes
everything
for
which
prayer
is
rightly
offered
it
is
greatest
in
its
intensity
it
hits
the
very
of
opposition
to
god
ii
hindrances
to
prayer
why
the
results
fail
why
the
results
are
delayed
the
great
outside
hindrance
or
the
relation
of
prayer
to
satan
why
the
results
fail
u
breaking
with
god
answers
prayer
prayer
is
god
and
man
joining
hands
to
secure
some
high
end
he
joins
with
us
through
the
communication
of
prayer
in
accomplishing
certain
great
results
this
is
the
main
drive
of
prayer
our
asking
and
expecting
and
god
doing
jointly
bring
to
pass
things
that
otherwise
would
not
come
to
pass
prayer
changes
things
this
is
the
great
fact
of
prayer
yet
a
great
many
prayers
are
not
answered
or
to
put
it
more
accurately
a
great
many
prayers
fail
utterly
of
accomplishing
any
results
probably
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
of
prayers
go
up
and
bring
nothing
down
this
is
certainly
true
let
us
say
it
just
as
bluntly
and
plainly
as
it
can
be
said
as
a
result
many
persons
are
saying
well
prayer
is
not
what
you
claim
for
it
we
prayed
and
no
answer
came
nothing
was
changed
from
all
sorts
of
circles
and
in
all
sorts
of
language
comes
this
statement
scholarly
men
who
write
with
wisdom
words
and
thoughtless
people
whose
thinking
never
even
pricks
the
skin
of
the
subject
and
all
sorts
of
people
in
between
group
themselves
together
here
and
they
are
right
quite
right
the
bother
is
that
what
they
say
is
not
all
there
is
to
be
said
there
is
yet
more
to
be
said
that
is
right
too
and
that
changes
the
final
conclusion
radically
partial
truth
is
a
very
mean
sort
of
lie
the
prayer
plan
like
many
another
has
been
much
disturbed
and
often
broken
and
one
who
would
be
a
partner
with
god
up
to
the
limit
of
his
power
must
understand
the
things
that
hinder
the
prayer
plan
there
are
three
sorts
of
hindrances
to
prayer
first
of
all
there
are
things
in
us
that
off
with
god
the
source
of
the
changing
power
then
there
are
certain
things
in
us
that
or
the
results
that
interfere
with
the
full
swing
of
the
prayer
plan
of
operations
and
then
there
is
a
great
hindrance
to
be
reckoned
upon
we
want
to
talk
together
of
the
first
of
these
namely
the
hindrances
that
off
between
god
and
his
human
partner
here
again
there
is
a
division
into
three
there
are
three
things
directly
spoken
of
in
the
book
of
god
that
hinder
prayer
one
of
these
is
a
familiar
thing
what
a
pity
that
repugnant
things
may
become
so
familiar
as
no
longer
to
repel
it
is
this
hinders
prayer
in
first
chapter
god
himself
speaking
says
when
you
stretch
out
your
hands
the
way
they
prayed
standing
with
outstretched
hands
i
will
shut
my
eyes
when
you
make
many
prayers
i
will
shut
my
ears
why
what
the
difficulty
these
outstretched
hands
are
they
are
actually
holding
their
hands
up
into
god
face
and
he
is
compelled
to
look
at
the
thing
most
hateful
to
him
in
the
chapter
of
this
same
book
god
himself
is
talking
again
listen
behold
the
hand
is
not
shortened
ear
is
not
heavy
there
is
no
trouble
on
the
side
god
is
all
right
but
listen
with
both
your
ears
your
your
your
your
your
your
the
slime
of
sin
is
oozing
over
everything
turn
back
to
that
psalm
if
i
regard
iniquity
in
my
heart
the
lord
will
not
hear
me
how
much
more
if
the
sin
of
the
heart
get
into
the
hands
or
the
life
and
the
fact
to
put
down
plainly
in
blackest
ink
once
for
all
is
this
hinders
there
is
nothing
surprising
about
this
that
we
can
think
the
reverse
is
the
surprising
thing
prayer
is
transacting
business
with
god
sin
is
with
suppose
i
had
a
private
wire
from
my
apartments
here
to
my
home
in
cleveland
and
some
one
should
go
outside
and
drag
the
wire
down
until
it
touches
the
ground
a
good
square
touch
with
the
ground
the
electricians
would
call
it
grounded
could
i
telegraph
over
that
wire
almost
any
child
knows
i
could
not
suppose
some
one
the
wire
a
good
clean
cut
the
two
ends
are
apart
not
a
mile
not
a
yard
but
distinctly
apart
could
i
telegraph
on
that
wire
of
course
not
yet
i
might
sit
in
my
room
and
tick
away
by
the
hour
wholly
absorbed
and
use
most
beautiful
persuasive
language
what
is
the
good
the
wire
cut
all
my
fine
pleading
goes
into
the
ground
or
the
air
now
cuts
the
wire
it
runs
the
message
into
the
ground
well
some
one
will
object
now
you
cutting
us
all
out
are
you
not
are
we
not
all
conscious
of
a
sinful
something
inside
here
that
has
to
be
fought
and
held
under
all
the
while
it
certainly
seems
to
be
true
that
the
nearer
a
man
gets
to
god
the
more
keenly
conscious
he
is
of
a
sinful
tendency
within
even
while
having
continual
victory
but
plainly
enough
what
the
book
means
here
is
this
if
i
am
holding
something
in
my
life
that
the
master
does
not
like
if
i
am
failing
to
obey
when
his
voice
has
spoken
that
to
me
is
sin
it
may
be
wrong
in
itself
it
may
be
wrong
in
itself
it
may
not
be
wrong
for
another
sometimes
it
is
not
the
thing
involved
but
the
one
involved
that
makes
the
issue
if
that
faithful
quiet
inner
voice
has
spoken
and
i
know
what
the
master
would
prefer
and
i
fail
to
keep
in
line
that
to
me
is
sin
then
prayer
is
useless
sheer
waste
of
breath
aye
worse
it
is
deceptive
for
i
am
apt
to
say
or
think
well
i
am
not
as
good
as
you
or
you
but
then
i
am
not
so
bad
and
the
truth
is
because
i
have
broken
with
god
the
praying
saying
words
in
that
form
is
utterly
worthless
you
see
is
slapping
god
in
the
it
may
be
polished
cultured
sin
sin
seems
capable
of
taking
quite
a
high
polish
or
it
may
be
the
common
gutter
stuff
a
man
is
not
concerned
about
the
grain
of
a
club
that
strikes
him
a
blow
how
can
he
and
i
talk
together
if
i
have
done
that
and
stick
to
it
not
even
apologized
and
of
what
good
is
an
apology
if
the
offense
is
being
repeated
and
if
we
can
not
talk
together
of
course
working
together
is
out
of
the
question
and
prayer
is
working
together
with
god
prayer
is
with
in
his
plan
for
a
world
shall
we
not
put
out
the
thing
that
is
wrong
or
put
in
the
thing
the
master
wants
in
for
sake
aye
for
sake
poor
befooled
men
sake
who
are
being
kept
out
and
away
because
god
can
not
get
at
them
through
us
shall
we
bow
and
ask
forgiveness
for
our
sin
and
petty
stubbornness
that
has
been
thwarting
the
master
and
yet
even
while
we
ask
forgiveness
there
are
lives
out
yonder
warped
and
dwarfed
and
worse
because
of
the
hindrance
in
us
yes
and
remaining
so
as
we
slip
out
of
this
meeting
may
the
fact
send
us
out
to
walk
very
softly
these
coming
days
u
a
coaling
station
for
satan
there
is
a
second
thing
that
is
plainly
spoken
of
that
hinders
prayer
james
speaks
of
it
in
his
letter
ye
have
not
because
ye
not
that
explains
many
parched
up
lives
and
churches
and
unsolved
problems
no
pipe
lines
run
up
to
tap
the
reservoir
and
give
god
an
opening
into
the
troubled
territory
then
he
pushes
on
to
say
ye
ask
receive
ah
there
just
the
rub
it
is
evidently
an
old
story
this
thing
of
not
receiving
why
because
ye
ask
amiss
to
spend
it
your
that
is
to
say
selfish
praying
asking
for
something
just
because
i
want
it
want
it
for
myself
here
is
a
mother
praying
for
her
boy
he
is
just
growing
up
towards
young
manhood
not
a
christian
boy
yet
but
a
good
boy
she
is
thinking
i
want
boy
to
be
an
honour
to
me
he
bears
my
name
my
blood
is
in
his
veins
i
do
want
my
boy
to
be
a
prodigal
i
want
him
to
be
a
fine
man
an
honour
to
the
family
and
if
he
is
a
true
christian
he
likely
will
be
wish
he
were
a
and
so
she
prays
and
prays
repeatedly
and
fervently
god
might
touch
her
boy
heart
and
say
i
want
you
out
here
in
india
to
help
win
my
prodigal
world
back
she
did
not
mean
that
boy
in
far
far
off
oh
no
not
that
yes
what
wanted
that
was
the
whole
thought
selfishness
the
stream
turning
in
to
a
dead
sea
within
her
own
narrow
circle
no
thought
of
sympathy
with
god
in
his
eager
outreach
for
his
poor
world
the
prayer
itself
in
its
object
is
perfectly
proper
and
rightly
offered
and
answered
times
without
number
but
the
wholly
uglily
selfish
and
the
selfishness
itself
becomes
a
foothold
for
satan
and
so
the
purpose
of
the
prayer
is
thwarted
here
is
a
wife
praying
that
her
husband
might
become
a
christian
perhaps
her
thought
is
i
wish
john
a
christian
it
would
be
so
good
it
really
seems
the
proper
thing
he
would
go
to
church
with
me
and
sit
in
the
pew
sunday
morning
i
like
that
perhaps
she
thinks
he
would
be
careful
about
swearing
he
would
quit
drinking
and
be
nicer
and
gentler
at
home
maybe
she
thinks
he
would
ask
a
blessing
at
the
meals
that
would
be
so
nice
maybe
she
thinks
we
would
have
family
prayers
that
does
not
occur
to
her
these
days
this
is
what
i
say
her
thought
does
not
go
beyond
some
such
range
of
course
would
say
it
is
selfish
she
is
thinking
of
herself
not
of
the
loving
grieved
god
against
whom
her
husband
is
in
rebellion
not
of
the
real
significance
to
the
man
god
might
touch
her
husband
heart
and
then
say
i
want
you
to
help
me
win
my
poor
world
back
and
the
change
would
mean
a
reduced
income
and
a
different
social
position
she
had
not
meant
yes
what
wanted
for
herself
here
is
a
minister
praying
for
a
revival
in
his
church
maybe
he
is
thinking
no
not
exactly
thinking
it
is
just
half
thinking
itself
out
in
his
i
wish
we
had
a
good
revival
in
our
church
increased
membership
larger
attendance
easier
finances
may
be
an
extra
hundred
or
two
in
my
own
pocket
increased
prestige
in
the
denomination
a
better
call
or
appointment
i
wish
we
might
have
a
revival
now
no
true
minister
ever
talked
that
way
even
to
himself
or
deliberately
thought
it
to
do
so
would
be
to
see
the
mean
contemptibility
of
it
but
you
know
how
sly
we
all
are
in
our
underneath
thoughts
this
is
what
i
say
that
be
the
sort
of
thing
underneath
a
man
praying
of
course
the
motive
is
utterly
selfish
a
bit
of
the
same
thing
that
brought
satan
his
change
of
name
and
character
please
notice
that
the
reason
for
the
prayer
not
being
answered
here
is
not
an
arbitrary
reluctance
upon
god
part
to
do
a
desirable
thing
he
never
fails
to
work
whenever
he
has
a
half
chance
as
far
as
it
is
possible
to
work
even
through
men
of
faulty
conceptions
and
mixed
motives
the
reason
lies
much
deeper
it
is
this
selfishness
gives
satan
a
footing
it
gives
a
coaling
station
for
his
fleet
on
the
shore
of
your
life
and
of
course
he
does
his
best
to
prevent
the
prayer
or
when
he
can
not
wholly
prevent
to
spoil
the
results
as
far
as
he
can
prayer
may
properly
be
offered
be
properly
offered
for
many
wholly
personal
things
for
physical
strength
healing
in
sickness
about
dearly
loved
ones
money
needed
indeed
regarding
things
that
may
not
be
necessary
but
only
desirable
and
enjoyable
for
ours
is
a
loving
god
who
would
have
his
dear
ones
enjoy
to
the
full
their
lives
down
here
but
the
determines
the
propriety
of
such
requests
where
the
whole
purpose
of
one
life
is
these
things
may
be
asked
for
freely
as
his
gracious
spirit
within
guides
and
there
need
be
no
bondage
of
morbid
introspection
no
continual
internal
rakings
knows
if
the
purpose
of
the
heart
is
to
please
u
the
shortest
way
to
a
third
thing
spoken
of
as
hindering
prayer
is
an
unforgiving
spirit
you
have
noticed
that
jesus
speaks
much
about
prayer
and
also
speaks
much
about
forgiveness
but
have
you
noticed
how
over
and
over
again
he
these
two
prayer
forgiveness
i
used
to
wonder
why
i
do
not
so
much
now
nearly
everywhere
evidence
keeps
slipping
in
of
the
sore
spots
one
may
try
to
keep
his
lips
closed
on
certain
subjects
but
it
seems
about
impossible
to
keep
the
ears
entirely
shut
and
continually
the
evidence
keeps
sifting
in
revealing
the
thin
skin
raw
flesh
wounds
never
healed
over
and
some
jaggedly
open
almost
everywhere
one
goes
jesus
continual
references
reveal
how
strikingly
alike
is
the
oriental
and
the
occidental
the
first
and
the
twentieth
centuries
run
through
matthew
alone
a
moment
here
in
the
fifth
chapter
if
thou
are
coming
to
the
altar
that
is
approaching
god
what
we
call
prayer
and
rememberest
that
thy
brother
hath
aught
that
side
of
it
leave
there
thy
gift
and
go
thy
way
be
reconciled
and
so
on
here
comes
a
man
with
a
lamb
to
offer
he
approaches
solemnly
reverently
towards
the
altar
of
god
but
as
he
is
coming
there
flashes
across
his
mind
the
face
of
with
whom
he
has
had
difficulty
and
instantly
he
can
feel
his
grip
tightening
on
the
offering
and
his
teeth
shutting
closer
at
the
quick
memory
jesus
says
if
that
be
so
lay
your
lamb
right
down
what
go
abruptly
away
why
how
the
folks
around
the
temple
will
talk
lay
the
lamb
right
down
and
go
thy
way
the
shortest
way
to
god
for
that
man
is
not
the
way
to
the
altar
but
around
by
that
man
house
be
reconciled
keep
your
perspective
straight
follow
the
right
order
be
reconciled
not
come
and
offer
thy
gift
in
the
sixth
chapter
he
gives
the
form
of
prayer
which
we
commonly
call
the
lord
prayer
it
contains
seven
petitions
at
the
close
he
stops
to
emphasize
just
one
of
the
seven
you
remember
which
one
the
one
about
forgiveness
in
the
eighteenth
chapter
jesus
is
talking
alone
with
the
disciples
about
prayer
peter
seems
to
remember
the
previous
remarks
about
forgiveness
in
connection
with
prayer
and
he
asks
a
question
it
is
never
difficult
to
think
of
peter
asking
a
question
or
making
a
few
remarks
he
says
master
how
many
times
i
forgive
a
man
times
apparently
peter
thinks
he
is
growing
in
grace
he
can
actually
now
of
forgiving
a
man
seven
times
in
succession
but
the
master
in
effect
says
peter
you
have
caught
the
idea
forgiveness
is
not
a
question
of
mathematics
not
a
matter
of
on
somebody
not
seven
times
but
times
and
eyes
bulge
open
with
an
incredulous
stare
four
hundred
and
ninety
times
one
man
straightway
apparently
the
master
is
thinking
that
he
will
lose
count
or
get
tired
of
counting
and
conclude
that
forgiveness
is
preferable
or
else
by
practice
in
the
spirit
of
forgiveness
thing
he
meant
then
as
he
was
so
fond
of
doing
jesus
told
a
story
to
illustrate
his
meaning
a
man
owed
his
lord
a
great
debt
twelve
millions
of
dollars
that
is
to
say
practically
an
amount
by
comparison
with
money
in
the
western
world
it
would
be
about
twelve
billions
and
he
went
to
him
and
asked
for
time
he
said
i
short
just
now
but
i
mean
to
pay
i
do
mean
to
shirk
be
easy
with
me
and
i
pay
up
the
whole
sum
in
time
and
his
lord
generously
forgave
him
the
whole
debt
that
is
jesus
picture
of
god
as
he
knows
him
who
knows
him
best
then
this
forgiven
man
went
out
and
found
a
fellow
servant
who
owed
him
how
much
do
you
think
have
you
ever
thought
that
jesus
had
a
keen
sense
of
the
ludicrous
surely
it
shows
here
he
owed
him
about
sixteen
dollars
and
or
and
you
can
almost
feel
the
clutch
of
this
fingers
on
the
other
throat
as
he
sternly
demands
pay
me
that
thou
owest
and
his
fellow
earnestly
replies
please
be
easy
with
me
i
mean
to
pay
i
rather
short
just
now
but
i
not
trying
to
shirk
be
easy
with
me
is
it
possible
the
words
do
not
sound
familiar
but
he
would
not
but
put
him
in
the
jail
the
last
place
to
pay
a
debt
that
is
picture
of
man
as
he
knows
him
who
knows
him
best
and
in
effect
he
says
what
we
have
been
forgiven
by
god
is
as
an
unpayable
amount
and
what
are
not
willing
to
forgive
is
like
sixteen
dollars
and
a
fraction
by
contrast
what
little
puny
folks
some
of
us
are
in
our
thinking
and
feeling
oh
well
some
one
says
you
do
not
know
how
hard
it
is
to
forgive
you
think
not
i
know
this
much
that
some
persons
and
some
things
you
forgive
of
yourself
but
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
know
this
too
that
if
one
allows
the
spirit
of
jesus
to
sway
the
heart
he
will
make
you
love
persons
you
like
no
natural
affinity
or
drawing
together
through
disposition
but
a
real
yearning
love
in
the
heart
jesus
love
when
allowed
to
come
in
as
freely
as
he
means
fills
your
heart
with
pity
for
the
man
who
has
wounded
you
an
infinite
tender
pity
that
he
has
sunk
so
low
as
to
be
capable
of
such
actions
but
the
fact
to
put
down
in
the
sharpest
contrast
of
white
and
black
is
that
we
must
forgive
freely
frankly
generously
as
if
we
are
to
be
in
prayer
touch
with
god
and
the
reason
is
not
far
to
find
a
double
reason
godward
and
satanward
if
prayer
be
partnership
in
the
highest
sense
then
the
same
spirit
must
animate
both
partners
the
human
and
the
divine
if
the
largest
results
are
to
come
and
since
unforgiveness
roots
itself
down
in
hate
satan
has
room
for
both
feet
in
such
a
heart
with
all
the
leeway
in
action
of
such
purchase
that
word
what
a
group
of
relatives
it
has
near
and
far
jealousy
envy
bitterness
the
cutting
word
the
polished
shaft
of
sarcasm
with
the
poisoned
tip
the
green
eye
the
acid
saliva
what
kinsfolk
these
u
search
sin
selfishness
an
unforgiving
spirit
what
searchlights
these
words
are
many
a
splendid
life
is
an
utter
cipher
in
the
spirit
atmosphere
because
of
some
such
hindrance
and
god
great
for
his
prodigal
world
is
being
held
back
and
lives
being
lost
even
where
ultimately
souls
shall
be
saved
because
of
the
lack
of
human
prayer
partners
may
we
not
well
pray
search
me
oh
god
and
know
my
heart
and
help
me
know
it
try
me
and
know
my
innermost
undermost
thoughts
and
purposes
and
ambitions
and
help
me
know
them
and
see
what
way
there
be
in
me
that
is
a
grief
to
thee
and
then
lead
me
and
here
the
prayer
may
be
a
purpose
as
well
as
a
prayer
lead
me
out
of
that
way
unto
way
way
everlasting
for
jesus
sake
aye
for
men
sake
too
why
the
results
are
delayed
u
god
pathway
to
human
god
touches
men
through
men
the
spirit
path
to
a
human
heart
is
through
another
human
heart
with
reverence
be
it
said
yet
with
blunt
plainness
that
in
his
plan
for
winning
men
to
their
true
allegiance
god
is
limited
by
the
human
limitations
that
may
seem
to
mean
more
than
it
really
does
for
our
thought
of
the
human
is
of
the
scarred
warped
shrivelled
humanity
that
we
know
and
great
changes
come
when
god
spirit
controls
but
the
fact
is
there
however
limited
our
understanding
of
it
god
needs
man
for
his
plan
that
is
the
fact
that
stands
out
strong
in
thinking
about
prayer
god
greatest
agency
man
greatest
agency
for
defeating
the
enemy
and
winning
men
back
is
intercession
god
is
counting
mightily
upon
that
and
he
can
count
most
mightily
upon
the
man
that
faithfully
practices
that
the
results
he
longs
for
are
being
held
back
and
made
smaller
because
so
many
of
us
have
not
learned
how
to
pray
simply
and
skilfully
we
need
training
and
god
understands
that
he
himself
will
train
but
we
must
be
willing
actively
willing
and
just
there
the
great
bother
comes
in
a
strong
will
perfectly
yielded
to
god
will
or
perfectly
willing
to
be
yielded
is
his
mightiest
ally
in
redeeming
the
world
answers
to
prayer
are
delayed
or
denied
out
of
kindness
that
more
may
be
given
that
a
far
larger
purpose
may
be
served
but
deeper
down
by
far
than
that
is
this
purposes
are
being
delayed
because
of
our
unwillingness
to
learn
how
to
pray
our
slowness
i
almost
said
our
stupidity
in
learning
it
is
a
small
matter
that
my
prayer
be
answered
or
unanswered
not
small
to
me
everything
perhaps
to
me
but
small
in
proportion
it
is
a
tremendous
thing
that
for
a
world
is
being
held
back
through
my
lack
the
thought
that
prayer
is
from
god
chiefly
that
is
so
small
pitiably
small
and
yet
so
common
the
true
conception
understands
that
prayer
is
partnership
with
god
in
his
purposes
and
includes
the
all
things
beside
as
an
important
detail
of
the
whole
the
real
reason
for
the
delay
or
failure
lies
simply
in
the
difference
between
god
and
ours
in
our
asking
either
we
have
not
reached
the
that
asks
best
we
have
not
reached
the
that
is
willing
to
sacrifice
a
good
thing
for
a
better
or
the
best
the
unselfishness
that
is
willing
to
sacrifice
the
smaller
personal
desire
for
the
larger
thing
that
affects
the
lives
of
many
we
learn
best
by
pictures
and
by
stories
which
are
pen
or
word
pictures
this
was
jesus
favourite
method
of
teaching
there
are
in
the
bible
four
great
striking
instances
of
delayed
or
qualified
answers
to
prayer
there
are
some
others
but
these
stand
out
sharply
and
perhaps
include
the
main
teachings
of
all
probably
all
the
instances
of
hindered
prayer
with
which
we
are
familiar
will
come
under
one
of
these
that
is
to
say
where
there
are
good
connections
upward
as
suggested
in
our
last
talk
excepting
those
that
come
under
the
talk
succeeding
this
namely
the
great
outside
hindrance
these
four
are
moses
request
to
enter
canaan
hannah
prayer
for
a
son
paul
thorn
and
jesus
prayer
in
gethsemane
let
us
look
a
bit
at
these
in
turn
u
for
the
sake
of
a
first
is
the
incident
of
moses
ungranted
petition
moses
was
the
leader
of
his
people
he
is
one
of
the
giants
of
the
human
race
from
whatever
standpoint
considered
his
codes
are
the
basis
of
all
english
and
american
jurisprudence
from
his
own
account
of
his
career
the
secret
of
all
his
power
as
a
maker
of
laws
the
organizer
of
a
strangely
marvellous
nation
a
military
general
and
strategist
the
secret
of
all
was
in
his
direct
communication
with
god
he
was
peculiarly
a
man
of
prayer
everything
was
referred
to
god
and
he
declared
that
everything
laws
organization
worship
plans
came
to
him
from
god
in
national
emergencies
where
moral
catastrophe
was
threatened
he
petitioned
god
and
the
plans
were
changed
in
accordance
with
his
request
he
makes
personal
requests
and
they
are
granted
he
was
peculiarly
a
man
who
dealt
directly
with
god
about
every
sort
of
thing
national
and
personal
simple
and
complex
the
record
commonly
credited
to
him
puts
prayer
as
the
simple
profound
explanation
of
his
stupendous
career
and
achievements
he
prayed
god
worked
along
the
line
of
his
prayer
the
great
things
recorded
are
the
result
that
is
the
simple
inferential
summary
now
there
is
one
exception
to
all
this
in
moses
life
it
stands
out
the
more
strikingly
that
it
is
an
exception
the
one
exception
of
a
very
long
line
moses
asked
repeatedly
for
one
thing
it
was
not
given
him
god
is
not
capricious
nor
arbitrary
there
must
be
a
reason
and
it
is
fairly
luminous
with
light
here
are
the
facts
these
freed
men
of
egypt
are
a
hard
lot
to
lead
and
to
live
with
slow
sensuous
petty
ignorant
narrow
impulsive
strangers
to
critical
exasperating
what
an
undertaking
god
had
to
make
a
nation
nation
of
history
about
which
centred
his
deep
reaching
love
ambition
for
redeeming
a
world
out
of
such
stuff
only
paralleled
by
the
church
being
built
upon
such
men
as
these
galilean
peasants
what
victories
these
what
a
god
to
do
such
things
only
a
god
could
do
either
and
both
what
immense
patience
it
required
to
shape
this
people
what
patience
god
has
moses
had
learned
much
of
patience
in
the
desert
sands
with
his
sheep
for
he
had
learned
much
of
god
but
the
finishing
touches
were
supplied
by
the
grindstone
of
friction
with
the
fickle
temper
of
this
mob
of
here
are
the
immediate
circumstances
they
lacked
water
they
grew
very
thirsty
it
was
a
serious
matter
in
those
desert
sands
with
human
lives
and
young
children
and
the
stock
no
it
was
not
serious
really
a
very
small
matter
for
was
and
the
enterprise
was
of
his
starting
it
was
his
affair
all
this
strange
journey
and
they
knew
him
quite
well
enough
in
their
brief
experience
to
be
expecting
something
fully
equal
to
all
needs
with
a
margin
thrown
in
there
was
that
series
of
stupendous
things
before
leaving
egypt
there
was
the
red
sea
and
fresh
food
daily
delivered
at
every
man
tent
door
and
game
juicy
birds
brought
down
within
arms
reach
yes
and
surely
this
alone
were
enough
there
was
living
cool
water
gushing
abundantly
gladly
out
of
the
very
heart
of
a
flinty
rock
if
such
a
thing
can
be
said
to
have
a
heart
oh
yes
it
was
a
very
small
matter
to
be
lacking
anything
with
such
a
lavish
god
along
they
their
noses
were
keener
than
their
memories
they
had
better
stomachs
than
hearts
the
odorous
onions
of
egypt
made
more
lasting
impressions
than
this
tender
patient
planning
god
yet
here
even
their
stomachs
forgot
those
waters
these
people
must
be
kinsfolk
of
ours
they
seem
to
have
some
of
the
same
family
traits
listen
they
begin
to
complain
to
criticise
god
patiently
says
nothing
but
provides
for
their
needs
but
moses
has
not
yet
reached
the
high
level
that
later
experiences
brought
him
he
is
standing
to
them
for
god
yet
he
is
very
angrily
with
hot
word
he
the
rock
once
smiting
was
god
plan
then
the
quiet
word
ever
after
how
many
a
time
has
the
once
smitten
rock
been
smitten
again
in
our
impatience
waters
just
like
god
they
were
cared
for
though
he
had
been
disobeyed
and
dishonoured
and
there
are
the
crowds
eagerly
drinking
with
faces
down
and
up
yonder
in
the
shadow
standeth
god
deeply
grieved
at
the
false
picture
this
immature
people
had
gotten
of
him
that
day
through
moses
moses
hot
tongue
and
flashing
eye
made
a
deep
moral
scar
upon
their
minds
that
it
would
take
years
to
remove
something
must
be
done
for
the
people
sake
moses
disobeyed
god
he
dishonoured
god
yet
the
waters
came
for
needed
and
god
is
ever
but
they
must
be
taught
the
need
of
obedience
the
evil
of
disobedience
taught
it
so
they
never
could
forget
moses
was
a
leader
leaders
may
not
do
as
common
men
and
leaders
may
not
be
dealt
with
as
followers
they
stand
too
high
in
the
air
they
affect
too
many
lives
so
god
said
to
moses
you
will
not
go
into
canaan
you
may
lead
them
clear
up
to
the
line
you
may
even
see
over
but
you
may
not
go
in
that
hurt
moses
deep
down
it
hurt
god
deeper
down
in
a
heart
more
sensitive
to
hurt
than
was
moses
without
doubt
it
was
said
with
for
sake
but
was
plainly
irrevocably
for
sakes
moses
petition
was
for
a
reversal
of
this
decision
once
and
again
he
asked
he
wanted
to
see
that
wondrous
land
of
choosing
he
felt
the
sting
too
the
edge
of
the
knife
of
discipline
cut
keenly
and
the
blood
spurted
but
god
said
do
not
speak
to
me
again
of
this
the
decision
was
not
to
be
changed
for
moses
sake
only
he
would
gladly
have
changed
judging
by
his
previous
conduct
for
the
sake
of
the
nation
aye
for
the
sake
of
the
prodigal
world
to
be
won
back
through
this
nation
the
petition
might
not
be
granted
that
ungranted
petition
taught
those
millions
the
lesson
of
obedience
of
reverence
as
no
command
or
smoking
mount
or
drowning
egyptians
had
done
it
became
common
talk
in
every
tent
by
every
of
the
tented
nation
moses
disobeyed
he
failed
to
reverence
god
he
can
not
enter
canaan
with
hushed
tones
and
awed
hearts
and
moved
strangely
moved
faces
it
passed
from
lip
to
lip
some
of
the
women
and
children
wept
they
all
loved
moses
they
revered
him
how
gladly
they
would
have
had
him
go
over
the
truth
obedience
disobedience
kept
burning
in
through
the
years
in
after
years
many
a
hebrew
mother
told
her
baby
eager
for
a
story
of
moses
their
great
leader
his
appearance
eyes
long
beard
majestic
mien
yet
infinite
tenderness
and
gentleness
the
softness
of
strength
his
presence
with
god
in
the
mount
the
shining
face
and
the
baby
would
listen
so
quietly
and
then
the
eyes
would
grow
so
big
and
the
hush
of
spirit
come
as
the
mother
would
repeat
softly
but
he
could
not
come
over
into
the
land
of
promise
because
did
not
obey
and
strong
fathers
reminded
their
growing
sons
and
so
it
was
woven
into
the
warp
and
woof
of
the
nation
reverent
obedience
to
and
one
can
well
understand
moses
looking
down
from
above
with
grateful
heart
that
he
had
been
denied
for
sakes
the
unselfishness
and
wisdom
of
later
years
would
not
have
made
the
prayer
prayer
of
a
man
was
denied
that
a
nation
might
be
taught
u
that
more
might
be
given
and
now
let
us
look
a
bit
at
the
second
of
these
the
portrait
of
hannah
the
hebrew
woman
first
the
broader
lines
for
perspective
this
peculiar
hebrew
nation
had
two
deep
dips
down
morally
between
egypt
and
babylon
between
the
first
making
and
the
final
breaking
the
national
tide
ebbed
very
low
twice
before
it
finally
ran
out
in
the
euphrates
valley
elijah
stemmed
the
tide
the
second
time
and
saved
the
day
for
a
later
night
the
hannah
story
belongs
in
the
first
of
these
the
first
bad
sag
the
first
deep
gap
the
giant
lawgiver
is
long
gone
his
successor
only
a
less
giant
than
himself
is
gone
too
and
all
that
generation
and
more
the
giants
gave
way
to
leaders
now
they
are
gone
also
the
mountain
peaks
have
been
lost
in
the
foothills
and
these
have
yielded
to
dunes
and
levels
mostly
levels
dead
levels
these
mountains
must
have
had
long
legs
the
foothills
are
so
far
away
and
are
running
all
to
toes
now
the
toes
have
disappeared
it
is
a
leaderless
people
for
the
true
leader
as
originally
planned
has
been
first
ignored
then
forgot
the
people
have
no
ideals
they
grub
in
the
earth
content
there
is
a
deep
current
of
good
but
it
needs
leadership
to
bring
it
to
the
surface
a
leaderless
people
this
is
the
niche
of
the
hannah
story
the
nation
was
rapidly
drifting
down
to
the
moral
level
of
the
lowest
at
shiloh
the
formal
worship
was
kept
up
but
the
very
priests
were
tainted
with
the
worst
impurity
a
sort
of
sleepy
slovenly
anarchy
prevailed
every
man
did
that
which
was
right
in
his
own
eyes
with
every
indication
of
a
gutter
standard
there
was
none
in
the
land
possessing
power
of
restraint
that
might
put
them
to
shame
in
anything
no
government
no
dominant
spirit
indeed
the
actual
conditions
of
sodom
and
her
sister
cities
of
the
plain
existed
among
the
people
this
is
the
setting
of
the
simple
graphic
incident
of
hannah
one
must
get
the
picture
clearly
in
mind
to
understand
the
story
up
in
the
hill
country
of
ephraim
there
lived
a
religious
man
a
farmer
raising
stock
and
grain
and
fruit
too
likely
he
was
earnest
but
not
of
the
sort
to
rise
above
the
habit
of
his
time
his
farm
was
not
far
from
shiloh
the
national
place
of
worship
and
he
made
yearly
trips
there
with
the
family
but
the
curse
of
lamech
was
over
his
home
he
had
two
wives
hannah
was
the
loved
one
no
man
ever
yet
gave
his
heart
to
two
women
she
was
a
thoughtful
woman
with
a
deep
earnest
spirit
but
she
had
a
disappointment
which
grew
in
intensity
as
it
continued
the
desire
of
her
heart
had
been
withheld
she
was
childless
though
the
thing
is
not
mentioned
the
whole
inference
is
that
she
prayed
earnestly
and
persistently
but
to
her
surprise
and
deep
disappointment
the
desired
answer
came
not
to
make
it
worse
her
rival
what
a
word
for
the
other
one
in
the
home
with
her
her
rival
provoked
her
sore
to
make
her
fret
and
that
thing
year
after
year
that
teasing
nagging
picking
of
a
small
nature
was
her
constant
prod
what
an
atmosphere
for
a
home
is
it
any
wonder
that
she
was
in
bitterness
of
soul
and
wept
sore
her
husband
tenderly
tries
to
comfort
her
but
her
inner
spirit
remains
chafed
to
the
quick
and
all
this
goes
on
for
years
the
yearning
the
praying
the
failure
of
answer
the
biting
bitter
atmosphere
for
and
she
wonders
why
why
was
it
step
back
and
up
a
bit
and
get
the
broader
view
which
the
narrow
limits
of
her
surroundings
and
shall
i
say
too
though
not
critically
of
her
spirit
shut
out
from
her
eyes
here
is
what
she
saw
her
fondest
hope
unrealized
long
praying
unanswered
a
constant
ferment
at
home
here
is
what
she
wanted
that
is
her
horizon
beyond
that
her
thought
does
not
rise
here
is
what
god
saw
a
nation
no
much
worse
nation
in
which
centred
his
great
for
winning
his
prodigal
world
going
to
pieces
the
messenger
to
the
prodigal
was
being
slyly
subtly
seduced
by
the
prodigal
the
was
being
itself
lost
the
plan
so
long
and
patiently
fostered
for
saving
a
world
was
threatened
with
utter
disaster
here
is
what
he
wanted
but
there
were
no
leaders
and
worse
yet
there
were
no
men
out
of
whom
leaders
might
be
made
no
men
of
and
worse
yet
were
no
of
the
sort
to
train
and
shape
a
man
for
leadership
that
is
the
lowest
level
to
which
a
people
ever
gets
aye
ever
get
god
had
to
get
a
woman
before
he
could
get
a
man
hannah
had
in
her
the
making
of
the
woman
he
needed
god
honoured
her
by
choosing
her
but
she
must
be
changed
before
she
could
be
used
and
so
there
came
those
years
of
pruning
and
sifting
and
discipline
shall
we
spell
that
word
discipline
with
a
final
g
instead
of
e
discipling
so
the
love
of
it
may
be
plainer
to
our
and
out
of
those
years
and
experiences
there
came
a
new
woman
a
woman
with
vision
broadened
with
spirit
mellowed
with
strength
seasoned
with
will
so
sinewy
supple
as
to
yield
to
a
higher
will
to
sacrifice
the
dearest
for
the
purpose
willing
that
he
who
was
her
dearest
treasure
should
be
the
nation
then
followed
months
of
prayer
while
the
man
was
coming
samuel
was
born
no
farther
back
yet
was
conceived
in
the
atmosphere
of
prayer
and
devotion
to
god
the
prenatal
influences
for
those
months
gave
the
sort
of
man
god
wanted
and
a
nation
nation
the
was
saved
this
man
became
a
living
answer
to
prayer
the
romantic
story
of
the
little
boy
up
in
the
shiloh
tabernacle
quickly
spread
over
the
nation
his
very
name
samuel
god
hears
sifted
into
people
ears
the
facts
of
a
god
and
of
the
power
of
prayer
the
very
sight
of
the
boy
and
of
the
man
clear
to
the
end
kept
deepening
the
brain
impression
through
eyeballs
that
god
answers
prayer
and
the
seeds
of
that
in
god
that
leadership
brought
about
were
sown
by
the
unusual
story
of
his
birth
answer
was
delayed
that
more
might
be
given
and
and
exultant
song
of
praise
reveals
the
fineness
to
which
the
texture
of
her
nature
had
been
spun
and
it
tells
too
how
grateful
she
was
for
a
god
who
in
great
patience
and
of
strong
deliberate
purpose
delayed
the
answer
to
her
prayer
u
the
best
light
for
studying
a
the
third
great
picture
in
this
group
is
that
of
paul
and
his
thorn
talks
about
the
certainty
of
prayer
being
answered
are
very
apt
to
bring
this
question
what
about
paul
thorn
sometimes
asked
by
earnest
hearts
puzzled
with
a
look
in
the
eye
almost
exultant
as
though
of
gladness
for
that
thorn
because
it
seems
to
help
out
a
theory
these
pictures
are
put
into
the
gallery
for
our
help
let
us
pull
up
our
chairs
in
front
of
this
one
and
see
what
points
we
may
get
to
help
our
hearts
first
a
look
at
paul
himself
the
best
light
on
this
thorn
is
through
the
man
the
man
explains
the
thorn
we
have
a
halo
about
paul
head
and
rightly
too
what
a
splendid
man
of
god
he
was
god
chosen
one
for
a
peculiar
ministry
one
of
the
twelve
could
be
used
to
open
the
door
to
the
great
outside
world
but
god
had
to
go
aside
from
this
circle
and
get
a
man
of
different
training
for
this
wider
sphere
cradled
and
schooled
in
a
jewish
atmosphere
he
never
lost
the
jew
standpoint
yet
the
training
of
his
home
surroundings
in
that
outside
world
the
contact
with
greek
culture
his
natural
mental
cast
fitted
him
peculiarly
for
his
appointed
task
to
the
great
outside
majority
his
keen
reasoning
powers
his
vivid
imagination
his
will
his
burning
devotion
his
unmovable
purpose
his
tender
attachment
to
his
lord
what
a
man
well
might
the
master
want
to
win
such
a
man
for
service
sake
but
paul
had
some
weak
traits
let
us
say
it
very
softly
remembering
as
we
instinctively
will
that
where
we
think
of
one
in
him
there
come
crowding
to
memory
door
many
more
in
one
self
a
man
weak
point
is
usually
the
extreme
opposite
swing
of
the
pendulum
on
his
strong
point
paul
had
a
tremendous
will
he
was
a
giant
a
hercules
in
his
will
those
tireless
journeys
with
their
terrific
experiences
all
spell
out
large
and
black
but
gently
now
he
went
to
extremes
here
was
it
due
to
his
overtired
nerves
likely
enough
he
was
obstinate
stubborn
set
in
his
way
head
down
jaw
locked
driving
hard
say
it
all
for
we
are
speaking
of
dear
old
saintly
paul
but
to
help
it
for
it
is
true
god
had
a
hard
time
holding
paul
to
plans
paul
had
some
of
his
own
we
can
all
easily
understand
that
take
a
side
glance
or
two
as
he
is
pushing
eagerly
splendidly
on
turn
to
that
sixteenth
chapter
of
acts
and
listen
having
been
forbidden
of
the
holy
spirit
to
speak
the
word
in
the
province
of
asia
coupled
with
the
fact
of
sickness
being
allowed
to
overtake
him
in
galatia
where
the
forbidding
message
came
and
again
this
they
assayed
to
go
into
bithynia
and
the
spirit
of
jesus
suffered
them
not
tell
me
is
this
the
way
the
spirit
of
god
leads
that
i
should
go
driving
ahead
until
he
must
pull
me
up
with
a
sharp
turn
and
twist
me
around
it
is
the
way
he
is
obliged
to
do
many
times
no
doubt
with
most
of
us
but
his
chosen
way
his
own
way
surely
not
rather
this
the
keeping
close
and
quiet
and
listening
for
the
next
step
rather
the
i
go
not
up
yet
unto
this
feast
of
jesus
and
then
in
a
few
days
going
up
evidently
when
the
clear
intimation
came
these
words
assayed
to
go
forbidden
suffered
not
what
flashlights
they
let
into
this
strong
man
character
but
there
is
much
stronger
evidence
yet
paul
had
an
ambition
to
preach
to
the
it
burned
in
his
bones
from
the
early
hours
of
his
new
life
the
substratum
of
seemed
ever
in
his
thoughts
and
dreams
if
could
just
get
to
those
jerusalem
jews
he
knew
them
he
had
trained
with
them
he
was
a
leader
among
the
younger
set
when
they
burned
against
these
christians
he
burned
just
a
bit
hotter
they
knew
him
they
trusted
him
to
drive
the
opposite
wedge
if
only
could
have
a
chance
down
there
he
felt
that
the
tide
might
be
turned
but
from
that
critical
hour
on
the
damascene
road
had
been
sounded
in
his
ears
and
he
obeyed
of
course
he
obeyed
with
all
his
ardent
heart
those
if
he
might
go
to
jerusalem
yet
very
early
the
master
had
proscribed
the
jerusalem
service
for
paul
he
made
it
a
matter
of
a
special
vision
in
the
holy
temple
kindly
explaining
why
they
will
not
receive
of
testimony
concerning
me
would
that
not
seem
quite
sufficient
surely
yet
this
astonishing
thing
occurs
paul
attempts
to
argue
with
the
master
he
should
be
allowed
to
go
this
is
going
to
great
lengths
a
subordinate
arguing
with
his
commanding
general
after
the
orders
have
been
issued
the
master
closes
the
vision
with
a
peremptory
word
of
command
i
will
send
thee
from
jerusalem
where
you
long
to
be
to
the
gentiles
that
is
a
picture
of
this
man
it
reveals
the
weak
side
in
this
giant
of
strength
and
of
love
and
is
the
man
god
has
to
use
in
his
plan
he
is
without
doubt
the
best
man
available
and
in
his
splendour
he
stands
head
and
shoulders
above
his
generation
and
many
generations
yet
with
much
reverence
god
has
a
hard
time
getting
paul
to
work
always
along
the
line
of
plans
that
is
the
man
now
for
the
thorn
something
came
into
paul
life
that
was
a
constant
irritation
he
calls
it
a
thorn
what
a
graphic
word
a
sharp
point
prodding
into
his
flesh
ever
prodding
sticking
sticking
in
asleep
awake
stitching
tent
canvas
preaching
writing
that
thing
ever
cutting
its
point
into
his
sensitive
flesh
ugh
it
did
not
disturb
him
so
much
at
first
because
was
to
go
to
he
went
to
god
and
said
take
this
away
but
it
stayed
and
stuck
a
second
time
the
prayer
a
bit
more
urgent
the
thing
sticks
so
the
time
test
is
the
hardest
test
of
all
still
no
change
then
praying
the
third
time
with
what
earnestness
one
can
well
imagine
now
note
three
things
first
was
an
god
answered
though
he
did
not
grant
the
petition
he
answered
the
man
he
did
not
ignore
him
nor
his
request
then
god
told
paul
frankly
that
it
was
not
best
to
take
the
thorn
away
it
was
in
the
lonely
vigil
of
a
sleepless
night
likely
as
not
that
the
wondrous
drew
near
to
paul
inaudibly
to
outer
ear
but
very
plainly
to
his
inner
ear
he
spoke
in
tones
modulated
into
tender
softness
as
of
dearest
friend
talking
with
dear
friend
paul
the
voice
said
i
know
about
that
thorn
and
how
it
hurts
it
hurts
me
too
for
sake
i
would
quickly
so
quickly
remove
it
but
paul
and
the
voice
becomes
still
softer
it
is
a
bit
better
for
sake
that
it
remain
the
plan
in
my
heart
for
thousands
yes
unnumbered
thousands
paul
can
so
best
be
worked
out
that
was
the
first
part
of
what
he
said
and
paul
lies
thinking
with
a
deep
tinge
of
awe
over
his
spirit
then
after
a
bit
in
yet
quieter
voice
he
went
on
to
say
i
will
be
so
close
to
your
side
you
shall
have
such
revelations
of
my
glory
that
the
pain
will
be
clear
overlapped
paul
the
glory
shall
outstrip
the
eating
thorn
point
i
can
see
old
paul
one
night
in
his
own
hired
house
in
rome
it
is
late
after
a
busy
day
the
auditors
have
all
gone
he
is
sitting
on
an
old
bench
slowing
down
before
seeking
sleep
one
arm
is
around
luke
dear
faithful
doctor
luke
and
the
other
around
young
timothy
not
quite
so
young
now
and
with
eyes
that
glisten
and
utterance
tremulous
with
emotion
he
is
just
saying
and
dear
old
friends
do
you
know
i
would
not
have
missed
this
thorn
for
the
wondrous
glory
and
his
heart
gets
into
his
voice
there
is
a
touch
of
the
hoarseness
of
deep
emotion
and
a
quavering
of
tone
so
he
waits
a
moment
the
wondrous
of
that
came
with
it
and
so
out
of
the
experience
came
a
double
blessing
there
was
a
much
fuller
working
of
god
plan
for
his
poor
befooled
world
and
there
was
an
unspeakable
nearness
of
intimacy
with
his
lord
for
paul
man
was
answered
and
the
petition
denied
that
the
larger
plan
of
service
might
be
carried
u
shaping
a
prayer
on
the
anvil
of
the
the
last
of
these
pictures
is
like
raphael
sistine
madonna
in
the
dresden
gallery
it
is
in
a
room
by
itself
one
enters
with
a
holy
hush
over
his
spirit
and
with
awe
in
his
eyes
looks
at
in
there
is
the
kidron
brook
the
gentle
rise
of
ground
the
grove
of
gnarled
knotty
old
olive
trees
the
moon
above
is
at
the
full
its
brightness
makes
these
shadowed
recesses
the
darker
blackly
dark
here
is
a
group
of
men
lying
on
the
ground
apparently
asleep
over
yonder
deeper
in
among
the
trees
a
smaller
group
reclines
motionless
they
too
sleep
and
look
farther
in
yet
is
that
lone
figure
all
alone
nevermore
alone
save
once
on
the
morrow
there
is
a
foreshadowing
of
this
gethsemane
experience
in
the
requested
interview
of
the
greeks
just
a
few
intense
days
before
in
the
vision
which
the
greeks
unconsciously
brought
the
agony
of
the
olive
grove
began
the
climax
is
among
these
trees
how
sympathetic
those
inky
black
shadows
it
takes
bright
light
to
make
black
shadows
yet
they
were
not
black
enough
intense
men
can
get
so
absorbed
in
the
shadows
as
to
forget
the
light
this
great
jesus
son
of
god
god
the
son
the
son
of
man
god
a
man
no
draughtsman
pencil
ever
drew
the
line
between
his
divinity
and
humanity
nor
ever
shall
for
the
union
of
divine
and
human
is
itself
divine
and
therefore
clear
beyond
human
ken
here
his
humanity
stands
out
pathetically
luminously
stands
out
let
us
speak
of
it
very
softly
and
think
with
the
touch
of
awe
deepening
for
this
is
holiest
ground
the
battle
of
the
morrow
is
being
fought
out
here
calvary
is
in
gethsemane
the
victory
of
the
hill
is
won
in
the
grove
it
is
sheer
impossible
for
man
with
sin
grained
into
his
fibre
through
centuries
to
understand
the
horror
with
which
a
sinless
one
thinks
of
actual
contact
with
sin
as
jesus
enters
the
grove
that
night
it
comes
in
upon
his
spirit
with
terrific
intensity
that
he
is
actually
coming
into
contact
with
a
meaning
quite
beyond
us
coming
into
contact
with
sin
in
some
way
all
too
deep
for
definition
he
is
to
be
made
sin
the
language
used
to
describe
his
emotions
is
so
strong
that
no
adequate
english
words
seem
available
for
its
full
expression
an
indescribable
horror
a
chill
of
terror
a
frenzy
of
fright
seizes
him
the
poisonous
miasma
of
sin
seems
to
be
filling
his
nostrils
and
to
be
stifling
him
and
yonder
alone
among
the
trees
the
agony
is
upon
him
the
extreme
grips
him
may
there
not
yet
possibly
be
some
other
way
rather
than
this
a
bit
of
that
prayer
comes
to
us
in
tones
strangely
altered
by
deepest
emotion
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
there
is
still
a
clinging
to
a
possibility
some
possibility
other
than
that
of
this
nightmare
vision
the
writer
of
the
hebrews
lets
in
light
here
the
strain
of
spirit
almost
snaps
the
and
a
parenthetical
prayer
for
strength
goes
up
and
the
angels
come
with
sympathetic
strengthening
with
what
awe
must
they
have
ministered
even
after
that
some
of
the
red
life
slips
out
there
under
the
trees
by
and
by
a
calmer
mood
asserts
itself
and
out
of
the
darkness
a
second
petition
comes
it
tells
of
the
turning
and
the
victory
full
and
complete
changed
this
this
cup
may
not
since
only
thus
thy
great
plan
for
a
world
be
wrought
out
slowly
but
very
distinctly
the
words
come
will
be
changed
prayer
was
wrought
out
upon
his
knees
with
greatest
reverence
and
a
hush
in
our
voices
let
us
say
that
there
alone
with
the
father
came
the
clearer
understanding
of
the
father
actual
will
under
these
circumstances
into
the
woods
my
master
went
clean
forspent
forspent
into
the
woods
my
master
came
forspent
with
love
and
shame
but
the
olives
they
were
not
blind
to
him
the
little
gray
leaves
were
kind
to
him
the
had
a
mind
to
him
when
into
the
woods
he
came
out
of
the
woods
my
master
went
and
he
was
well
content
out
of
the
woods
my
master
came
content
with
death
and
shame
when
death
and
shame
would
woo
him
last
from
under
the
trees
they
drew
him
last
was
on
a
tree
they
slew
him
last
when
out
of
the
woods
he
came
true
prayer
is
wrought
out
upon
the
knees
alone
with
god
with
deepest
reverence
and
in
awed
tones
let
it
be
said
that
was
true
of
in
the
days
of
his
humanity
how
infinitely
more
of
us
shall
we
not
plan
to
meet
god
alone
habitually
with
the
door
shut
and
the
book
open
and
the
will
pliant
so
we
may
be
trained
for
this
holy
partnership
of
prayer
then
will
come
the
clearer
vision
the
broader
purpose
the
truer
wisdom
the
real
unselfishness
the
simplicity
of
claiming
and
expecting
the
delights
of
fellowship
in
service
with
him
then
too
will
come
great
victories
for
god
in
his
world
although
we
shall
not
begin
to
know
by
direct
knowledge
a
tithe
of
the
story
until
the
night
be
gone
and
the
dawning
break
and
the
shadows
that
now
stain
the
earth
shall
be
chased
away
by
the
brightness
of
his
presence
the
great
outside
hindrance
u
the
traitor
there
remains
yet
a
word
to
be
said
about
hindrances
it
is
a
most
important
word
indeed
the
climactic
word
what
has
been
said
is
simply
clearing
the
way
for
what
is
yet
to
be
said
a
very
strange
phase
of
prayer
must
be
considered
here
strange
only
because
not
familiar
yet
though
strange
it
contains
the
whole
heart
of
the
question
here
lies
the
fight
of
the
fight
one
marvels
that
so
little
is
said
of
it
for
if
there
were
clear
understanding
here
and
then
faithful
practicing
there
would
be
mightier
defeats
and
victories
defeats
for
the
foe
victories
for
our
rightful
prince
jesus
the
intense
fact
is
this
has
the
power
to
hold
the
answer
back
for
awhile
to
delay
the
result
for
a
he
has
not
the
power
to
hold
it
back
finally
some
one
understands
and
prays
with
quiet
steady
persistence
the
real
pitch
of
prayer
therefore
is
satanward
our
generation
has
pretty
much
left
this
individual
satan
out
it
is
partly
excusable
perhaps
the
conceptions
of
satan
and
his
hosts
and
surroundings
made
classical
by
such
as
dante
and
milton
and
doré
have
done
much
to
befog
the
air
almost
universally
they
have
been
taken
literally
whether
so
meant
or
not
one
familiar
with
characteristics
can
easily
imagine
his
cunning
finger
in
that
he
is
willing
even
to
be
caricatured
or
to
be
left
out
of
reckoning
if
so
he
may
tighten
his
grip
these
suggestions
of
horns
and
hoofs
of
forked
tail
and
all
the
rest
of
it
seek
to
give
material
form
to
this
being
they
are
grotesque
to
an
extreme
and
therefore
caricatures
a
caricature
so
disproportions
and
exaggerates
as
to
make
hideous
or
ridiculous
in
our
day
when
every
foundation
of
knowledge
is
being
examined
there
has
been
a
natural
but
unthinking
turning
away
from
the
very
being
of
satan
through
these
representations
of
him
yet
where
there
is
a
caricature
there
must
be
a
true
to
revolt
from
the
true
hidden
by
a
caricature
in
revolting
from
the
caricature
is
easy
but
is
certainly
bad
it
is
always
bad
to
have
the
truth
hid
from
our
eyes
it
is
refreshing
and
fascinating
to
turn
from
these
classical
caricatures
to
the
scriptural
conception
of
satan
in
this
book
he
is
a
being
of
great
beauty
of
person
of
great
dignity
of
position
even
yet
endowed
with
most
remarkable
intellectual
powers
a
prince
at
the
head
of
a
most
remarkable
compact
organization
which
he
has
wielded
with
phenomenal
skill
and
success
in
furthering
his
ambitious
purposes
and
he
is
not
chained
yet
i
remember
a
conversation
with
a
young
clergyman
one
monday
morning
in
the
of
a
young
christian
association
it
was
in
a
certain
mining
town
in
the
southwest
which
is
as
full
of
evil
resorts
as
such
places
usually
are
the
day
before
sunday
had
been
one
of
special
services
and
we
had
both
been
busy
and
were
a
bit
weary
we
were
slowing
down
and
chatting
leisurely
i
remarked
to
my
friend
what
a
glad
day
it
will
be
when
the
millennium
comes
he
quickly
replied
i
think
this
is
the
millennium
but
i
said
i
thought
satan
was
to
be
chained
during
that
time
does
it
say
something
of
that
sort
in
the
book
yes
he
replied
it
does
but
i
think
he
is
chained
now
and
i
could
not
resist
the
answer
that
came
blurting
its
way
out
well
if
he
is
chained
he
must
have
a
fairly
long
chain
it
seems
to
permit
much
freedom
of
action
from
all
that
can
be
gathered
regarding
this
mighty
prince
he
is
not
chained
yet
we
would
do
well
to
learn
more
about
him
the
old
military
maxim
study
the
enemy
should
be
followed
more
closely
here
it
is
striking
that
the
oldest
of
the
bible
books
and
the
latest
job
and
revelation
the
first
word
and
the
last
give
such
definite
information
concerning
him
these
coupled
with
the
gospel
records
supply
most
of
the
information
available
though
not
all
those
three
and
a
half
years
of
jesus
public
work
is
the
period
of
greatest
satanic
and
demoniac
activity
of
which
any
record
has
been
made
jesus
own
allusions
to
him
are
frequent
and
in
unmistakable
language
there
are
four
particular
passages
to
which
i
want
to
turn
your
attention
now
let
it
not
be
supposed
however
that
this
phase
of
prayer
rests
upon
a
few
isolated
passages
such
a
serious
truth
does
not
hinge
upon
selected
proof
texts
it
is
woven
into
the
very
texture
of
this
book
throughout
there
are
two
facts
that
run
through
the
bible
from
one
end
to
the
other
they
are
like
two
threads
ever
crossing
in
the
warp
and
woof
of
a
finely
woven
fabric
anywhere
you
run
your
shears
into
the
web
of
this
book
you
will
find
these
two
threads
they
run
crosswise
and
are
woven
inextricably
in
one
is
a
black
thread
inky
black
the
other
is
a
bright
thread
like
a
bit
of
glory
light
streaming
across
these
two
threads
everywhere
the
one
is
this
the
black
thread
there
is
an
enemy
turn
where
you
will
from
genesis
to
revelation
always
an
enemy
he
is
keen
he
is
subtle
he
is
malicious
he
is
cruel
he
is
obstinate
he
is
a
master
the
second
thread
is
this
the
leaders
for
god
have
always
been
men
of
prayer
above
everything
else
they
are
men
of
power
in
other
ways
preachers
men
of
action
with
power
to
sway
others
but
above
all
else
men
of
prayer
they
give
prayer
first
place
there
is
one
striking
exception
to
this
namely
king
saul
and
most
significantly
a
study
of
this
exception
throws
a
brilliant
lime
light
upon
the
career
of
satan
king
sauls
seems
to
furnish
the
one
great
human
illustration
in
scripture
of
heaven
renegade
fallen
prince
these
special
paragraphs
to
be
quoted
are
like
the
pattern
in
the
cloth
where
the
colours
of
the
yarn
come
into
more
definite
shape
the
gospels
form
the
central
pattern
of
the
whole
where
the
colours
pile
up
into
sharpest
contrast
u
praying
is
but
let
us
turn
to
the
book
at
once
for
we
only
what
it
tells
the
rest
is
surmise
the
only
authoritative
statements
about
satan
seem
to
be
these
here
turn
first
to
the
new
testament
the
old
testament
is
the
book
of
illustrations
the
new
of
explanations
of
teaching
in
the
old
teaching
is
largely
by
kindergarten
methods
the
best
methods
for
the
world
was
in
its
child
stage
in
the
new
the
teaching
is
by
precept
there
is
precept
teaching
in
the
old
very
much
there
is
picture
teaching
in
the
new
the
gospels
full
of
it
but
picture
teaching
acted
teaching
is
the
characteristic
of
the
old
and
precept
teaching
of
the
new
there
is
a
wonderfully
vivid
picture
in
the
old
testament
of
this
thing
we
are
discussing
but
first
let
us
get
the
teaching
counterpart
in
the
new
and
then
look
at
the
picture
turn
to
ephesians
ephesians
is
a
prayer
epistle
that
is
a
very
significant
fact
to
mark
of
paul
thirteen
letters
ephesians
is
peculiarly
the
prayer
letter
paul
is
clearly
in
a
prayer
mood
he
is
on
his
knees
here
he
has
much
to
say
to
these
people
whom
he
has
won
to
christ
but
it
comes
in
the
parenthesis
of
his
prayer
the
connecting
phrase
running
through
is
for
this
cause
i
pray
i
bow
my
knees
halfway
through
this
rare
old
man
mind
runs
out
to
the
condition
of
these
churches
and
he
puts
in
the
always
needed
practical
injunctions
about
their
daily
lives
then
the
prayer
mood
reasserts
itself
and
the
epistle
finds
its
climax
in
a
remarkable
paragraph
on
prayer
from
praying
the
man
goes
urging
them
to
pray
we
must
keep
the
book
open
here
as
we
talk
chapter
six
verses
ten
to
twenty
inclusive
the
main
drive
of
all
their
living
and
warfare
seems
very
clear
to
this
scarred
veteran
that
ye
may
be
able
to
withstand
the
wiles
of
the
devil
this
man
seems
to
have
had
no
difficulty
in
believing
in
a
personal
devil
probably
he
had
had
too
many
close
encounters
for
that
to
paul
satan
is
a
cunning
strategist
requiring
every
bit
of
available
resource
to
combat
this
paragraph
states
two
things
who
the
real
foe
is
against
whom
the
fight
is
directed
and
then
with
climactic
intensity
it
pitches
on
the
main
thing
that
routs
him
who
is
the
real
foe
listen
for
our
wrestling
is
not
against
flesh
and
blood
not
against
men
never
that
something
far
subtler
but
against
the
principalities
a
word
for
a
compact
organization
of
individuals
against
powers
not
only
organized
but
highly
endowed
intellectually
against
the
of
this
darkness
they
are
of
princely
kin
not
common
folk
against
the
hosts
of
wicked
spirits
in
the
heavenlies
spirit
beings
in
vast
numbers
having
their
headquarters
somewhere
above
the
earth
is
the
foe
large
numbers
of
highly
endowed
spirit
beings
compactly
organized
who
are
the
sovereigns
of
the
present
realm
or
age
of
moral
darkness
having
their
of
activity
somewhere
above
the
earth
and
below
the
throne
of
god
but
concerned
with
human
beings
upon
the
earth
in
chapter
two
of
the
epistle
the
head
or
ruler
of
this
organization
is
referred
to
the
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
that
is
the
real
foe
then
in
one
of
his
strong
piled
up
climactic
sentences
paul
tells
how
the
fight
is
to
be
won
this
sentence
runs
unbroken
through
verses
fourteen
to
twenty
inclusive
there
are
six
preliminary
clauses
in
it
leading
up
to
its
main
statement
these
clauses
name
the
pieces
of
armour
used
by
a
roman
soldier
in
the
action
of
battle
the
loins
girt
the
breastplate
on
the
feet
shod
the
shield
the
helmet
the
sword
and
so
on
a
roman
soldier
reading
this
or
hearing
paul
preach
it
would
expect
him
to
finish
the
sentence
by
saying
all
your
fighting
strength
that
would
be
the
proper
conclusion
rhetorically
of
this
sentence
but
when
paul
reaches
the
climax
with
his
usual
intensity
he
drops
the
rhetorical
figure
and
puts
in
the
thing
with
which
in
our
case
the
fighting
is
done
with
all
prayer
in
place
of
the
expected
word
fighting
is
the
word
praying
the
thing
with
which
the
fighting
is
done
is
put
in
place
of
the
word
itself
our
fighting
is
praying
praying
is
fighting
that
is
to
say
this
old
says
we
are
in
the
thick
of
a
fight
there
is
a
war
on
how
shall
we
best
fight
first
get
into
good
shape
to
pray
and
then
with
all
your
praying
strength
and
skill
that
word
is
the
climax
of
this
long
sentence
and
of
this
whole
epistle
this
is
the
sort
of
action
that
turns
the
enemy
flank
and
reveals
his
heels
he
simply
stand
before
persistent
now
mark
the
keenness
of
paul
description
of
the
man
who
does
most
effective
work
in
praying
there
are
six
qualifications
under
the
figure
of
the
six
pieces
of
armour
a
clear
understanding
of
truth
a
clean
obedient
life
earnest
service
a
strongly
simple
trust
in
god
clear
assurance
of
one
own
salvation
and
relation
to
god
and
a
good
grip
of
the
truth
for
others
these
things
prepare
a
man
for
the
real
conflict
of
prayer
a
back
these
hosts
of
the
traitor
such
a
man
praying
is
invincible
in
his
chief
jesus
the
equipment
is
simple
and
in
its
beginnings
comes
quickly
to
the
willing
earnest
heart
look
a
bit
at
how
the
strong
climax
of
this
long
sentence
runs
it
is
fairly
bristling
with
points
all
of
them
like
bayonet
points
just
such
as
a
general
engaged
in
a
would
give
to
his
men
with
all
prayer
and
supplication
there
is
praying
that
is
main
at
all
seasons
night
and
day
hot
and
cold
wet
and
dry
in
the
spirit
as
by
the
chief
and
watching
thereunto
vigilance
watching
is
ever
a
fighting
word
watch
the
enemy
watch
your
own
forces
with
all
perseverance
cheery
dogged
persistence
bulldog
tenacity
and
supplication
for
all
the
saints
sweep
of
the
keep
in
touch
with
the
whole
army
and
on
my
behalf
the
human
leader
rally
around
immediate
this
is
the
foe
to
be
fought
and
this
the
sort
of
fighting
that
defeats
this
foe
u
a
double
wrestling
now
turn
back
to
the
illustration
section
of
our
book
for
a
remarkably
graphic
illustration
of
these
words
it
is
in
the
old
prophecy
of
daniel
tenth
chapter
the
story
is
this
daniel
is
an
old
man
now
he
is
an
exile
he
has
not
seen
the
green
hills
of
his
fatherland
since
boyhood
in
this
level
babylon
he
is
homesick
for
the
dear
old
palestinian
hills
and
he
is
heartsick
over
the
plight
of
his
people
he
has
been
studying
jeremiah
prophecies
and
finds
there
the
promise
plainly
made
that
after
seventy
years
these
exiled
hebrews
are
to
be
allowed
to
return
go
back
again
the
thought
of
it
quickens
his
he
does
some
quick
counting
the
time
will
soon
be
up
so
daniel
plans
a
bit
of
time
for
special
prayer
a
sort
of
siege
prayer
remember
who
he
is
this
daniel
he
is
the
chief
executive
of
the
land
he
controls
under
the
king
the
affairs
of
the
world
empire
of
his
time
he
is
a
giant
of
strength
and
ability
this
man
but
he
plans
his
work
so
as
to
go
away
for
a
time
taking
a
few
kindred
spirits
who
understand
prayer
he
goes
off
into
the
woods
down
by
the
great
tigris
river
they
spend
a
day
in
fasting
and
meditation
and
prayer
not
utter
fasting
but
scant
eating
of
plain
food
i
suppose
they
pray
awhile
maybe
separately
then
together
then
read
a
bit
from
the
jeremiah
parchment
think
and
talk
it
over
and
then
pray
some
more
and
so
they
spend
a
whole
day
reading
meditating
praying
they
are
expecting
an
answer
these
intercessors
were
strong
in
expectancy
but
there
is
no
answer
a
second
day
a
third
a
fourth
a
week
still
no
answer
reaches
them
they
go
quietly
on
without
hesitation
two
weeks
how
long
it
must
have
seemed
think
of
fourteen
days
spent
waiting
for
something
with
your
heart
on
tenter
hooks
there
is
no
answer
god
might
have
been
dead
to
adapt
the
words
of
catharine
luther
so
far
as
any
answer
reaching
them
is
concerned
but
you
can
not
befool
daniel
in
that
way
he
is
an
old
hand
at
prayer
apparently
he
has
no
thought
of
quitting
he
goes
quietly
steadily
on
twenty
days
pass
with
no
change
still
they
persist
then
the
day
comes
and
there
is
an
answer
it
comes
in
a
vision
whose
glory
is
beyond
human
strength
to
bear
by
and
by
when
they
can
talk
his
visitor
and
he
this
is
what
daniel
hears
daniel
the
first
day
you
began
to
pray
your
prayer
was
heard
and
i
was
sent
with
the
answer
and
even
daniel
eyes
open
big
the
day
three
weeks
ago
yes
three
weeks
ago
i
left
the
presence
of
god
with
the
answer
to
your
prayer
but
listen
here
is
the
strange
part
the
prince
of
the
kingdom
of
persia
withstood
me
resisted
me
one
and
twenty
days
but
michael
your
prince
came
to
help
me
and
i
was
free
to
come
to
you
with
the
answer
to
your
prayer
please
notice
four
things
that
i
think
any
one
reading
this
chapter
will
readily
admit
this
being
talking
with
daniel
is
plainly
a
spirit
being
he
is
opposed
by
some
one
this
opponent
plainly
must
be
a
spirit
being
too
to
be
resisting
a
spirit
being
daniel
messenger
is
from
god
that
is
clear
then
the
opponent
must
be
from
the
opposite
camp
and
here
comes
in
the
thing
strange
unexpected
the
evil
spirit
being
the
power
to
detain
hold
back
god
for
three
full
weeks
by
reckoning
of
time
then
reenforcements
come
as
we
would
say
the
evil
messenger
purpose
is
defeated
and
god
messenger
is
free
to
come
as
originally
planned
there
is
a
double
scene
being
enacted
a
scene
you
can
see
and
a
scene
you
can
not
see
an
unseen
wrestling
match
in
the
upper
spirit
realm
and
two
embodied
spirit
beings
down
on
their
faces
by
the
river
and
both
concerned
over
the
same
thing
that
is
the
daniel
story
what
an
acted
out
illustration
it
is
of
words
it
is
a
picture
glowing
with
the
action
of
real
life
it
is
a
double
picture
every
prayer
action
is
in
doubles
a
lower
human
level
an
upper
spirit
level
many
see
only
the
seen
and
lose
heart
while
we
look
at
the
things
that
are
seen
let
us
gaze
intently
at
the
things
unseen
for
the
seen
things
are
secondary
but
the
unseen
are
chief
and
the
action
of
life
is
being
decided
there
here
is
the
lower
the
seen
a
group
of
men
led
by
a
man
of
executive
force
enough
to
control
an
empire
prone
on
their
faces
with
minds
clear
quiet
alert
persistently
ceaselessly
day
by
day
here
is
the
upper
the
unseen
a
wrestling
keen
stubborn
skilled
going
on
between
two
spirit
princes
in
the
spirit
realm
and
by
paul
explanation
the
two
are
vitally
connected
daniel
and
his
companions
are
wrestlers
too
active
participants
in
that
fight
and
really
deciding
the
issue
for
they
are
on
the
ground
being
contested
these
men
are
indeed
praying
with
all
prayer
and
supplication
at
all
times
in
the
spirit
and
watching
thereunto
with
all
perseverance
and
supplication
and
length
victory
u
prayer
concerns
now
a
bit
of
a
look
at
the
central
figure
of
the
pattern
jesus
lets
in
a
flood
of
light
on
satan
relation
to
prayer
in
one
of
his
prayer
parables
there
are
two
parables
dealing
distinctively
with
prayer
the
friend
at
midnight
and
the
unjust
judge
the
second
of
these
deals
directly
with
this
satan
phase
of
prayer
it
is
luke
through
whom
we
learn
most
of
jesus
own
praying
who
preserves
for
us
this
remarkable
prayer
picture
it
comes
along
towards
the
end
the
swing
has
been
made
from
plain
talking
to
the
less
direct
of
teaching
the
issue
with
the
national
leaders
has
reached
its
acutest
stage
the
culmination
of
their
hatred
short
of
the
cross
found
vent
in
charging
him
with
being
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
satan
he
felt
their
charge
keenly
and
answered
it
directly
and
fully
his
parable
of
the
strong
man
being
bound
before
his
house
can
be
rifled
comes
in
here
had
no
question
as
to
what
that
meant
that
is
the
setting
of
this
prayer
parable
the
setting
is
a
partial
interpretation
let
us
look
at
this
parable
rather
closely
for
it
is
full
of
help
for
those
who
would
become
skilled
in
helping
god
win
his
world
back
home
again
jesus
seems
so
eager
that
they
shall
not
miss
the
meaning
here
that
he
departs
from
his
usual
habit
and
says
plainly
what
this
parable
is
meant
to
teach
that
men
ought
always
to
pray
and
not
to
faint
the
great
essential
he
says
is
the
great
essential
in
prayer
is
the
temptation
in
prayer
is
that
one
may
lose
heart
and
give
up
or
give
in
tells
how
keen
the
contest
is
there
are
three
persons
in
the
parable
a
judge
a
widow
and
an
adversary
the
judge
is
utterly
selfish
unjust
godless
and
reckless
of
anybody
opinion
the
worst
sort
of
man
indeed
the
last
sort
of
man
to
be
a
judge
inferentially
he
knows
that
the
right
of
the
case
before
him
is
with
the
widow
the
widow
well
she
is
a
can
more
be
said
to
make
the
thing
vivid
and
pathetic
a
very
picture
of
friendlessness
and
helplessness
is
a
widow
a
woman
needs
a
friend
this
woman
has
lost
her
nearest
dearest
friend
her
protector
she
is
alone
there
is
an
adversary
an
opponent
at
law
who
has
unrighteously
or
illegally
gotten
an
advantage
over
the
widow
and
is
ruthlessly
pushing
her
to
the
wall
she
is
seeking
to
get
the
judge
to
join
with
her
against
her
adversary
her
urgent
oft
repeated
request
is
avenge
me
of
mine
adversary
that
is
jesus
pictorial
illustration
of
persistent
prayer
let
us
look
into
it
a
little
further
adversary
is
a
common
word
in
scripture
for
satan
he
is
the
accuser
the
hater
the
enemy
the
adversary
its
meaning
technically
is
an
opponent
in
a
suit
at
law
it
is
the
same
word
as
used
later
by
peter
your
adversary
the
devil
as
a
roaring
lion
goeth
about
seeking
whom
he
may
devour
the
word
avenge
used
four
times
really
means
do
me
justice
it
suggests
that
the
widow
has
the
facts
on
her
side
to
win
a
clear
case
and
that
the
adversary
has
been
his
case
through
by
sheer
force
there
is
a
strange
feature
to
this
parable
which
must
have
a
meaning
utterly
godless
unscrupulous
man
is
put
in
to
represent
god
this
is
startling
in
any
other
than
jesus
it
would
seem
an
overstepping
of
the
bounds
but
there
is
keenness
of
a
rare
sort
here
such
a
man
is
chosen
for
judge
to
bring
out
most
sharply
this
the
sort
of
thing
required
to
win
this
judge
is
certainly
not
required
the
widow
must
persist
and
plead
because
of
the
sort
of
man
she
has
to
deal
with
but
god
is
utterly
different
in
character
therefore
while
persistence
is
urged
in
prayer
plainly
it
is
not
for
the
reason
that
required
the
widow
to
persist
and
if
that
reason
be
cut
out
it
leaves
only
one
other
namely
that
represented
by
the
adversary
having
purposely
put
such
a
man
in
the
parable
for
god
jesus
takes
pains
to
speak
of
the
real
character
of
god
and
he
is
over
them
is
god
that
word
and
its
equivalent
on
jesus
lips
suggests
at
once
the
strong
side
of
love
namely
gentle
fine
patience
it
has
bothered
the
scholars
in
this
phrase
to
know
with
whom
or
over
what
the
is
exercised
over
them
is
the
doubtful
phrase
over
these
praying
ones
in
dealing
righteously
with
some
stubborn
adversary
which
the
next
sentence
has
a
word
set
in
sharpest
contrast
with
this
one
namely
speedily
yet
speedily
here
are
gleams
of
bright
light
on
a
dark
subject
with
apparently
more
light
obscured
than
is
allowed
to
shine
through
jesus
always
spoke
thoughtfully
he
chooses
his
words
remembering
the
adversary
against
whom
the
persistence
is
directed
the
whole
story
seems
to
suggest
this
that
there
is
great
conflict
in
the
upper
spirit
world
concerning
it
our
patient
god
is
he
is
a
just
and
righteous
god
these
beings
in
the
conflict
are
all
his
creatures
he
is
just
in
his
dealings
with
the
devil
and
this
splendid
host
of
evil
spirits
even
as
with
all
his
creation
he
is
that
no
unfairness
shall
be
done
in
his
dealings
with
these
creatures
of
his
yet
at
the
same
time
he
is
doing
his
best
to
bring
the
conflict
to
a
speedy
end
for
the
sake
of
his
loyal
loved
ones
and
that
right
may
prevail
the
upshot
of
the
parable
is
very
plain
it
contains
for
us
two
tremendous
intense
truths
first
is
this
concerns
not
two
but
three
god
to
whom
we
pray
the
man
on
the
contested
earth
who
prays
and
the
evil
one
against
whom
we
pray
and
the
purpose
of
the
prayer
is
not
to
persuade
or
influence
god
but
to
join
forces
with
him
against
the
enemy
not
towards
god
but
with
god
against
satan
that
is
the
main
thing
to
keep
in
mind
in
prayer
the
real
pitch
is
not
godward
but
satanward
the
second
intense
truth
is
this
the
winning
quality
in
prayer
is
the
final
test
is
here
this
is
the
last
ditch
many
who
fight
well
up
to
this
point
lose
their
grip
here
and
so
lose
all
many
who
are
well
equipped
for
prayer
fail
here
and
doubtless
fail
because
they
have
not
rightly
understood
with
clear
ringing
tones
the
voice
sounds
in
our
ears
again
always
to
pray
not
to
faint
u
a
stubborn
foe
that
is
the
parable
teaching
now
a
look
at
a
plain
out
word
from
the
master
lips
it
is
in
the
story
of
the
demonized
boy
the
distressed
father
and
the
defeated
disciples
at
the
foot
of
the
transfiguration
mountain
extremes
meet
here
surely
the
mountain
peak
is
in
sharpest
contrast
with
the
valley
the
demon
seems
to
be
of
the
superlative
degree
his
treatment
of
the
possessed
boy
is
malicious
to
an
extreme
his
purpose
is
to
destroy
him
yet
there
is
a
limit
to
his
power
for
what
he
would
do
he
has
not
yet
been
able
to
do
he
shows
extreme
tenacity
he
fought
bitterly
against
being
disembodied
again
can
it
be
that
embodiment
eases
in
some
way
the
torture
of
existence
for
these
prodigal
spirits
and
so
far
he
fought
well
and
with
success
the
disciples
had
tried
to
cast
him
out
they
were
expected
to
they
expected
to
they
had
before
they
failed
dismally
amid
the
sneering
and
jeering
of
the
crowd
and
the
increasing
distress
of
the
poor
father
then
jesus
came
was
some
of
the
transfiguring
glory
still
lingering
in
that
great
face
it
would
seem
so
the
crowd
was
amazed
when
they
saw
him
and
saluted
him
his
presence
changed
all
the
demon
angrily
left
doing
his
worst
to
wreck
the
house
he
had
to
vacate
the
boy
is
restored
and
the
crowd
astonished
at
the
power
of
god
then
these
disciples
did
a
very
keen
thing
they
made
some
bad
blunders
but
this
is
not
one
of
them
they
sought
a
private
talk
with
jesus
no
shrewder
thing
was
ever
done
when
you
fail
quit
your
service
and
get
away
for
a
private
interview
with
jesus
with
eyes
big
and
voices
dejected
the
question
wrung
itself
out
of
their
sinking
hearts
why
could
not
cast
it
out
matthew
and
mark
together
supply
the
full
answer
probably
first
came
this
because
of
your
little
faith
they
had
quailed
in
their
hearts
before
the
power
of
this
malicious
demon
and
the
demon
knew
it
they
were
more
impressed
with
the
power
of
the
demon
than
with
the
power
of
god
and
the
demon
saw
it
they
had
not
prayed
victoriously
against
the
demon
the
master
says
faith
only
as
big
as
a
mustard
seed
you
can
not
measure
the
strength
of
the
mustard
seed
by
its
size
will
say
to
this
mountain
mark
keenly
the
direction
of
the
faith
is
towards
the
obstacle
its
force
is
against
the
enemy
it
was
the
demon
who
was
most
directly
influenced
by
jesus
faith
then
comes
the
second
part
of
the
reply
this
kind
can
come
out
by
nothing
but
by
prayer
some
demons
may
be
cast
out
by
the
faith
that
comes
of
our
regular
with
god
this
extreme
sort
takes
special
prayer
this
kind
of
a
demon
goes
out
by
prayer
it
can
be
put
out
by
nothing
less
the
real
victory
must
be
in
the
secret
place
the
exercise
of
faith
in
the
open
battle
is
then
a
mere
pressing
of
the
victory
already
won
these
men
had
the
language
of
jesus
on
their
lips
but
they
had
not
gotten
the
victory
first
off
somewhere
alone
this
demon
is
determined
not
to
go
he
fights
stubbornly
and
strongly
he
succeeds
then
this
of
came
the
quiet
word
of
command
is
spoken
the
demon
must
go
these
disciples
were
strikingly
like
some
of
us
they
had
not
where
the
real
victory
is
won
they
had
used
the
word
of
command
to
the
demon
doubtless
coupling
jesus
name
with
it
but
there
was
not
the
secret
touch
with
god
that
gives
victory
their
eyes
showed
their
fear
of
the
demon
prayer
real
prayer
intelligent
prayer
it
is
this
that
routs
demons
for
it
routs
their
chief
david
killed
the
lion
and
bear
in
the
secret
forests
before
he
faced
the
giant
in
the
open
these
disciples
were
facing
the
giant
in
the
open
without
the
discipline
in
secret
this
kind
can
be
compelled
to
come
out
by
nothing
but
by
prayer
means
this
this
kind
comes
out
and
must
come
out
before
the
man
who
prays
this
thing
which
jesus
calls
prayer
casts
out
demons
would
that
we
knew
better
by
experience
what
he
meant
by
prayer
it
exerts
a
positive
influence
upon
the
hosts
of
evil
spirits
they
fear
it
they
fear
the
man
who
becomes
skilled
in
its
use
there
are
yet
many
other
passages
in
this
bible
fully
as
explicit
as
these
and
which
give
on
the
very
surface
just
such
plain
teaching
as
these
the
very
language
of
scripture
throughout
is
full
of
this
truth
but
these
four
great
instances
are
quite
sufficient
to
make
the
present
point
clear
and
plain
this
great
renegade
prince
is
an
actual
active
factor
in
the
lives
of
men
he
believes
in
the
potency
of
prayer
he
fears
it
he
can
hinder
its
results
for
a
while
he
does
his
best
to
hinder
it
and
to
hinder
as
long
as
possible
overcomes
it
defeats
his
plans
and
himself
he
can
not
successfully
stand
before
it
he
trembles
when
some
man
of
simple
faith
in
god
prays
prayer
is
insistence
upon
god
will
being
done
it
needs
for
its
practice
a
man
in
sympathetic
touch
with
god
its
basis
is
victory
it
overcomes
the
opposing
will
of
the
great
iii
how
to
pray
the
how
of
relationship
the
how
of
method
the
listening
side
of
prayer
something
about
god
will
in
connection
with
prayer
may
we
pray
with
assurance
for
the
conversion
of
our
loved
ones
the
how
of
relationship
u
god
if
i
had
an
ambition
to
be
the
ambassador
of
this
country
to
our
there
would
be
two
essential
things
involved
the
first
and
great
essential
would
be
to
receive
the
appointment
i
would
need
to
come
into
certain
relation
with
our
president
to
possess
certain
qualifications
considered
essential
by
him
and
to
secure
from
his
hand
the
appointment
and
the
official
credentials
of
my
appointment
that
would
establish
my
relationship
to
the
foreign
court
as
the
representative
of
my
own
country
and
my
right
to
transact
business
in
her
name
but
having
gotten
that
far
i
might
go
over
there
and
make
bad
mistakes
i
might
get
our
diplomatic
relations
tangled
up
requiring
many
explanations
and
maybe
apologies
and
leaving
unpleasant
memories
for
a
long
time
to
come
such
incidents
have
not
been
infrequent
nations
are
very
sensitive
governmental
affairs
must
be
handled
with
great
nicety
there
would
be
a
second
thing
which
if
i
were
a
wise
enough
man
to
be
an
ambassador
i
would
likely
do
i
would
go
to
see
john
hay
and
joseph
choate
and
have
as
many
interviews
with
them
as
possible
and
learn
all
i
possibly
could
from
them
of
london
official
life
court
etiquette
personages
to
be
dealt
with
things
to
do
and
things
to
avoid
how
to
be
a
successful
diplomat
and
further
the
good
feeling
between
the
two
governments
and
win
friends
for
our
country
among
the
sturdy
britons
would
be
my
one
absorbing
thought
and
having
gotten
all
i
could
in
that
way
i
would
be
constantly
on
the
alert
with
all
the
mental
keenness
i
could
command
to
practice
being
a
successful
ambassador
the
first
of
these
would
make
me
technically
an
ambassador
the
second
would
tend
towards
giving
me
some
skill
as
an
ambassador
now
there
are
the
same
two
how
in
praying
first
the
relationship
must
be
established
before
any
business
can
be
transacted
then
skill
must
be
acquired
in
the
transacting
of
the
business
on
hand
just
now
we
want
to
talk
about
the
first
of
these
the
how
of
relationship
in
prayer
the
basis
of
prayer
is
right
relationship
with
god
prayer
is
representing
god
in
the
spirit
realm
of
this
world
it
is
insisting
upon
his
rights
down
in
this
sphere
of
action
it
is
standing
for
him
with
full
powers
from
him
clearly
the
only
basis
of
such
relationship
to
god
is
we
have
been
outlawed
by
sin
we
were
in
touch
with
god
we
broke
with
him
the
break
could
not
be
repaired
by
us
jesus
came
he
was
god
man
he
touches
both
we
get
back
through
him
and
only
so
the
blood
of
the
cross
is
the
basis
of
all
prayer
through
it
the
relationship
is
established
that
underlies
all
prayer
only
as
i
come
to
god
through
jesus
to
get
the
sin
score
straightened
and
only
as
i
keep
in
sympathy
with
jesus
in
the
purpose
of
my
life
can
i
practice
prayer
u
six
sweeping
jesus
own
words
make
this
very
clear
there
are
two
groups
of
teachings
on
prayer
in
those
three
and
a
half
years
as
given
by
the
gospel
records
the
first
of
these
groups
is
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
which
jesus
preached
about
through
the
second
year
of
his
ministry
the
second
group
comes
sheer
at
the
end
all
of
it
is
in
the
last
six
months
and
most
of
it
in
the
last
ten
days
and
much
of
that
on
the
very
eve
of
that
last
tragic
day
it
is
after
the
sharp
rupture
with
the
leaders
that
this
second
series
of
statements
is
made
the
most
positive
and
most
sweeping
utterances
on
prayer
are
here
of
jesus
eight
promises
regarding
prayer
six
are
here
i
want
to
ask
you
please
to
notice
these
six
promises
or
statements
and
then
to
notice
their
relation
to
our
topic
of
in
matthew
is
the
first
of
these
again
i
say
unto
you
that
if
two
of
you
shall
agree
on
earth
as
touching
anything
that
they
shall
ask
it
shall
be
done
for
them
of
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
notice
the
place
of
prayer
on
earth
and
the
sweep
anything
and
the
positiveness
it
shall
be
done
then
the
reason
why
is
given
for
where
two
or
three
are
gathered
together
in
my
name
there
am
i
in
the
midst
of
them
that
is
to
say
if
there
are
two
persons
praying
there
are
three
if
three
meet
to
pray
there
are
four
praying
there
is
always
one
more
than
you
can
see
and
if
you
might
perhaps
be
saying
to
yourself
in
a
bit
of
dejection
he
not
hear
me
i
so
sinful
so
weak
you
would
be
wrong
in
thinking
and
saying
so
but
then
we
do
think
and
say
things
that
are
not
right
you
might
be
thinking
that
you
could
at
once
fall
back
upon
this
the
father
always
hears
jesus
and
wherever
earnest
hearts
pray
jesus
is
there
taking
their
prayer
and
making
it
his
prayer
the
second
of
these
mark
jesus
answering
saith
unto
them
have
faith
in
god
with
the
emphasis
under
the
word
god
the
chief
factor
in
prayer
is
god
verily
i
say
unto
you
whosoever
shall
say
unto
this
mountain
be
thou
taken
up
and
cast
into
the
sea
choosing
do
you
see
the
unlikeliest
thing
that
might
occur
such
a
thing
did
not
take
place
we
never
hear
of
jesus
moving
an
actual
mountain
the
need
for
such
action
does
not
seem
to
have
arisen
but
he
chooses
the
thing
most
difficult
for
his
illustration
can
you
imagine
a
mountain
moving
off
into
the
sea
the
jungfrau
or
blanc
or
rainier
if
you
know
mountains
down
in
your
country
you
can
not
imagine
it
actually
and
shall
not
doubt
in
his
heart
that
is
jesus
definition
of
but
shall
believe
that
what
he
saith
cometh
to
pass
he
shall
have
it
therefore
i
say
unto
you
all
things
whatsoever
ye
pray
and
ask
for
believe
that
ye
receive
them
and
ye
shall
have
them
how
utterly
sweeping
this
last
statement
and
to
make
it
more
positive
it
is
preceded
by
the
emphatic
therefore
i
say
unto
you
both
whatsoever
and
whosoever
are
here
anything
and
anybody
we
always
feel
instinctively
as
though
these
statements
need
careful
guarding
a
few
fences
put
up
around
them
wait
a
bit
and
we
shall
see
what
the
master
own
fence
is
the
last
four
of
the
six
are
in
john
gospel
in
that
last
long
quiet
talk
on
the
night
in
which
he
was
betrayed
john
preserves
much
of
that
for
us
in
chapters
thirteen
to
seventeen
here
in
john
and
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
in
my
name
that
will
i
do
that
the
father
may
be
glorified
in
the
son
if
ye
shall
ask
anything
in
my
name
that
will
i
do
the
repetition
is
to
emphasize
the
unlimited
sweep
of
what
may
be
asked
john
if
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
words
abide
in
you
that
word
abide
is
a
strong
word
it
does
not
mean
to
leave
your
cards
nor
to
hire
a
night
lodging
nor
to
pitch
a
tent
or
run
up
a
miner
shanty
or
a
lumberman
shack
it
means
moving
in
to
ask
whatsoever
ye
will
the
old
version
says
ye
shall
ask
but
here
the
revised
is
more
accurate
ask
please
ask
i
ask
you
to
ask
there
is
nothing
said
directly
about
god
will
there
is
something
said
about
our
and
it
shall
be
done
unto
you
or
a
little
more
literally
i
will
bring
it
to
pass
for
you
i
remember
the
remark
quoted
to
me
by
a
friend
one
day
his
church
membership
is
in
the
methodist
church
of
the
north
but
his
service
crosses
church
lines
both
in
this
country
and
abroad
he
was
talking
with
one
of
the
bishops
of
that
church
whose
heart
was
in
the
foreign
mission
field
the
bishop
was
eager
to
have
this
friend
serve
as
missionary
secretary
of
his
church
but
he
knew
as
everybody
knows
how
difficult
appointments
oftentimes
are
in
all
large
bodies
he
was
earnestly
discussing
the
matter
with
my
friend
and
made
this
remark
if
you
will
allow
the
use
of
your
name
for
this
appointment
will
lay
myself
to
have
it
made
now
if
you
will
kindly
not
think
there
is
any
lack
of
reverence
in
my
saying
so
and
there
is
surely
none
in
my
thought
that
is
the
practical
meaning
of
jesus
words
here
if
you
abide
in
me
and
my
words
sway
you
you
please
ask
what
it
is
your
will
to
ask
and
softly
reverently
now
i
will
lay
myself
out
to
bring
that
thing
to
pass
for
you
that
is
the
force
of
his
words
here
this
same
chapter
sixteenth
verse
ye
did
not
choose
me
but
i
chose
you
and
appointed
you
that
ye
should
go
and
bear
fruit
and
that
your
fruit
should
abide
that
whatsoever
ye
shall
ask
of
the
father
in
my
name
he
may
give
it
you
god
had
our
prayer
partnership
with
himself
in
his
mind
in
choosing
us
and
the
last
of
these
john
second
clause
verily
verily
i
say
unto
you
if
ye
shall
ask
anything
of
the
father
he
will
give
it
you
in
my
name
hitherto
have
ye
asked
nothing
in
my
name
ask
and
ye
shall
receive
that
your
joy
may
be
fulfilled
these
statements
are
the
most
sweeping
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
scriptures
regarding
prayer
there
is
no
limitation
as
to
who
shall
ask
nor
the
kind
of
thing
to
be
asked
for
there
are
three
limitations
imposed
the
prayer
is
to
be
the
person
praying
is
to
be
in
fullest
sympathy
with
him
and
this
person
is
to
have
faith
u
words
with
a
freshly
honed
now
please
group
these
six
sweeping
statements
in
your
mind
and
hold
them
together
there
then
notice
carefully
this
fact
these
words
are
not
spoken
to
the
crowds
they
are
spoken
to
the
small
inner
group
of
twelve
disciples
jesus
talks
one
way
to
the
multitude
he
oftentimes
talks
differently
to
these
men
who
have
separated
themselves
from
the
crowd
and
come
into
the
inner
circle
and
notice
further
that
before
jesus
spoke
these
words
to
this
group
of
men
he
had
said
something
else
first
something
very
radical
so
radical
that
it
led
to
a
sharp
passage
between
himself
and
peter
to
whom
he
speaks
very
sternly
this
something
else
fixes
unmistakably
their
relation
to
himself
remember
that
the
sharp
break
with
the
national
leaders
has
come
jesus
is
charged
with
satanic
collusion
the
death
plot
is
determined
upon
the
breach
with
the
leaders
is
past
the
healing
point
and
now
the
master
is
frequently
slipping
away
from
the
crowd
with
these
twelve
men
and
seeking
to
teach
and
train
them
that
is
the
setting
of
these
great
promises
it
must
be
kept
continually
in
mind
before
the
master
gave
himself
away
to
these
men
in
these
promises
he
said
this
something
else
it
is
this
i
quote
matthew
account
if
any
man
would
come
after
me
let
him
deny
himself
and
take
up
his
cross
daily
luke
addition
and
follow
me
words
should
be
written
crosswise
over
those
six
prayer
jesus
never
spoke
a
keener
word
those
six
promises
are
not
meant
for
all
let
it
be
said
very
plainly
they
are
meant
only
for
those
who
will
square
their
lives
by
these
words
i
may
not
go
fully
into
the
significance
of
these
words
here
they
have
been
gone
into
at
some
length
in
a
previous
set
of
talks
as
suggesting
the
price
of
power
to
him
whose
heart
burns
for
power
in
prayer
i
urge
a
careful
review
of
that
talk
in
this
new
setting
of
it
if
any
man
would
come
after
me
means
a
purpose
the
jaw
locked
the
tendrils
of
the
purpose
going
down
around
and
under
the
gray
granite
of
a
man
will
and
tying
themselves
there
and
knotting
the
ties
sailor
knots
that
you
can
not
undo
come
after
me
means
all
the
power
of
jesus
life
and
has
the
other
side
too
it
means
the
wilderness
the
intense
temptation
it
may
mean
the
obscure
village
of
nazareth
for
you
it
may
mean
that
first
judean
year
for
you
lack
of
appreciation
it
may
mean
for
you
that
last
six
months
the
desertion
of
those
hitherto
friendly
it
will
mean
without
doubt
a
gethsemane
everybody
who
comes
along
after
jesus
has
a
gethsemane
in
his
life
it
will
never
mean
as
much
to
you
as
it
meant
to
him
that
is
true
but
then
it
will
mean
everything
to
you
and
it
will
mean
too
having
a
calvary
in
your
life
in
a
very
real
sense
though
different
from
what
that
meant
to
him
this
sentence
through
gives
the
process
whereby
the
man
with
sin
grained
into
the
fibre
of
his
will
may
come
into
such
relationship
with
god
as
to
claim
without
any
reservation
these
great
prayer
promises
and
if
that
sound
hard
and
severe
to
you
let
me
quickly
say
that
it
is
an
easy
way
for
the
man
who
is
the
presence
of
jesus
in
the
life
overlaps
every
cutting
thing
if
a
man
will
go
through
matthew
and
habitually
live
there
he
may
ask
what
he
wills
to
ask
and
that
thing
will
come
to
pass
the
reason
without
question
why
many
people
do
not
have
power
in
prayer
is
simply
because
they
are
unwilling
i
am
just
talking
very
plainly
they
are
unwilling
to
bare
their
breasts
to
the
knife
in
these
words
of
jesus
and
on
the
other
side
if
a
man
will
quietly
resolutely
follow
the
master
leading
nothing
extreme
nothing
fanatical
or
morbid
just
a
quiet
going
where
that
inner
voice
plainly
leads
day
by
day
he
will
be
startled
to
find
what
an
utterly
new
meaning
prayer
will
come
to
have
for
him
u
the
controlling
vital
relationship
is
always
expressed
by
purpose
the
wise
ambassador
has
an
absorbing
purpose
to
further
the
interests
of
his
government
jesus
said
and
it
at
once
reveals
his
relationship
to
god
i
do
always
those
things
that
are
well
pleasing
to
him
the
relationship
that
underlies
prayer
has
an
absorbing
purpose
its
controlling
purpose
is
to
please
jesus
that
sentence
may
sound
simple
enough
but
do
you
know
there
is
no
sentence
i
might
utter
that
has
a
keener
a
more
freshly
honed
to
it
than
that
that
the
purpose
which
my
action
in
every
matter
be
this
to
please
him
if
you
have
not
done
so
take
it
for
a
day
a
week
and
use
it
as
a
touch
stone
regarding
thought
word
and
action
take
it
into
matters
personal
home
business
social
fraternal
it
does
not
mean
to
ask
is
this
right
is
this
wrong
not
that
not
the
driving
of
a
keen
line
between
wrong
and
right
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
can
be
proven
to
be
not
wrong
but
that
are
not
best
that
are
not
his
preference
it
will
send
a
business
man
running
his
eye
along
the
shelves
and
counter
of
his
store
the
controlling
purpose
to
please
jesus
i
guess
maybe
that
stuff
there
ought
to
come
out
oh
it
is
not
wrong
i
can
prove
that
my
christian
handle
it
here
and
over
the
country
but
please
a
good
clean
sixty
per
cent
profit
too
cash
money
but
please
and
the
stuff
must
go
down
and
out
it
would
set
some
woman
to
thinking
about
the
next
time
the
young
people
are
to
gather
in
her
home
for
a
delightful
social
evening
with
her
own
daughters
she
will
think
about
some
forms
of
pastime
that
are
found
everywhere
they
are
not
wrong
that
has
been
conclusively
proven
but
please
and
these
will
go
out
and
then
it
will
set
her
to
work
with
all
her
and
exquisite
tact
to
planning
an
evening
yet
more
delightful
it
will
make
one
think
of
his
personal
habits
his
business
methods
and
social
intercourse
the
organizations
he
belongs
to
with
the
quiet
question
cutting
it
into
each
and
if
some
one
listening
may
ask
why
put
the
condition
of
prayer
so
strongly
as
that
i
will
remind
you
of
this
the
true
basis
of
prayer
is
sympathy
oneness
of
purpose
prayer
is
not
extracting
favours
from
a
reluctant
god
it
is
not
passing
a
check
in
a
bank
window
for
money
that
is
mandatory
the
roots
of
prayer
lie
down
in
oneness
of
purpose
god
up
yonder
his
by
his
side
and
a
man
down
here
in
sympathetic
that
god
can
think
his
thoughts
over
in
this
mind
and
have
his
desires
repeated
upon
the
earth
as
this
man
prayer
u
the
threefold
cord
of
jesus
think
for
a
moment
into
jesus
human
life
down
here
his
marvellous
activities
for
those
few
years
over
which
the
world
has
never
ceased
to
wonder
then
his
underneath
of
which
only
occasional
glimpses
are
gotten
then
grouping
around
about
that
sentence
of
his
i
do
always
the
things
that
are
pleasing
to
him
in
gospel
pick
out
the
emphatic
negatives
on
jesus
lips
the
not
not
my
will
not
my
works
not
my
words
jesus
came
to
do
somebody
else
will
the
controlling
purpose
of
his
life
was
to
please
his
father
that
was
the
secret
of
the
power
of
his
earthly
career
right
relationship
to
god
a
secret
intimate
marvellous
power
over
men
and
with
men
those
are
the
strands
in
the
threefold
cord
of
his
life
there
is
a
very
striking
turn
of
a
word
in
the
second
chapter
of
gospel
down
almost
at
its
close
the
old
version
says
that
many
believed
on
his
name
beholding
his
signs
which
he
did
but
jesus
did
not
commit
himself
unto
them
because
he
knew
them
so
well
the
word
believed
and
the
word
commit
are
the
same
word
underneath
our
english
the
sentence
might
run
many
him
beholding
what
he
did
but
he
did
not
them
for
he
knew
them
i
have
no
doubt
most
or
all
of
us
here
trust
him
let
me
ask
you
very
softly
now
can
he
trust
you
while
we
might
all
shrink
from
saying
yes
to
that
there
is
a
very
real
sense
in
which
we
may
say
yes
namely
in
the
purpose
of
the
life
every
life
is
controlled
by
some
purpose
what
is
yours
to
please
him
if
so
he
knows
it
it
is
a
great
comfort
to
remember
that
god
judges
a
man
not
by
his
achievements
but
by
his
purposes
not
by
what
i
am
actually
but
by
what
i
would
be
in
the
yearning
of
my
inmost
heart
the
dominant
purpose
of
my
life
god
will
fairly
flood
your
life
with
all
the
power
he
can
trust
you
to
use
wholly
for
him
commercial
practice
furnishes
a
simple
but
striking
illustration
here
a
man
is
employed
by
a
business
house
as
a
clerk
his
ability
and
honesty
come
to
be
tested
in
many
ways
constantly
he
is
promoted
gradually
his
responsibilities
increased
as
he
proves
himself
thoroughly
reliable
he
is
trusted
more
and
more
until
by
and
by
as
need
arises
he
becomes
the
firm
confidential
clerk
he
knows
its
secrets
he
is
trusted
with
the
combination
to
the
inner
box
in
the
vault
because
it
has
been
proven
by
actual
test
that
he
will
use
everything
only
for
the
best
interests
of
his
house
and
not
selfishly
here
where
we
are
dealing
the
whole
thing
moves
up
to
an
infinitely
higher
level
but
the
principle
does
not
change
if
i
will
come
into
the
relationship
implied
in
these
words
it
shall
be
the
one
controlling
desire
and
purpose
of
my
life
to
do
the
things
that
please
him
then
i
may
ask
for
what
i
will
and
it
shall
be
done
that
is
how
to
pray
the
how
of
relationship
the
man
who
will
live
in
matthew
and
follow
jesus
as
he
leads
simply
that
no
fanaticism
no
morbidism
no
extremism
just
simply
follow
as
he
leads
day
by
day
then
those
six
promises
of
jesus
with
their
wonderful
sweep
their
limitless
sweep
are
his
to
use
as
he
will
the
how
of
method
u
touching
the
hidden
one
of
the
most
remarkable
illustrations
in
recent
times
of
the
power
of
prayer
may
be
found
in
the
experience
of
moody
it
explains
his
unparalleled
career
of
soul
winning
one
marvels
that
more
has
not
been
said
of
it
its
stimulus
to
faith
is
great
i
suppose
the
man
most
concerned
did
not
speak
of
it
much
because
of
his
fine
modesty
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
referred
to
it
more
frequently
as
though
impelled
to
the
last
time
i
heard
moody
was
in
his
own
church
in
chicago
it
was
i
think
in
the
fall
of
the
last
year
of
his
life
one
morning
in
the
old
church
made
famous
by
his
early
work
in
a
quiet
conversational
way
he
told
the
story
it
was
back
in
the
early
seventies
when
chicago
had
been
laid
in
ashes
this
building
was
not
yet
up
far
enough
to
do
much
in
he
said
so
i
thought
i
would
slip
across
the
water
and
learn
what
i
could
from
preachers
there
so
as
to
do
better
work
here
i
had
gone
over
to
london
and
was
running
around
after
men
there
then
he
told
of
going
one
evening
to
hear
spurgeon
in
the
metropolitan
tabernacle
and
understanding
that
he
was
to
speak
a
second
time
that
evening
to
dedicate
a
chapel
moody
had
slipped
out
of
the
building
and
had
run
along
the
street
after
spurgeon
carriage
a
mile
or
so
so
as
to
hear
him
the
second
time
then
he
smiled
and
said
quietly
i
was
running
around
after
men
like
that
he
had
not
been
speaking
anywhere
he
said
but
listening
to
others
one
day
saturday
at
noon
he
had
gone
into
the
meeting
in
exeter
hall
on
the
strand
felt
impelled
to
speak
a
little
when
the
meeting
was
thrown
open
and
did
so
at
the
close
among
others
who
greeted
him
one
man
a
minister
asked
him
to
come
and
preach
for
him
the
next
day
morning
and
night
and
he
said
he
would
moody
said
i
went
to
the
morning
service
and
found
a
large
church
full
of
people
and
when
the
time
came
i
began
to
speak
to
them
but
it
seemed
the
hardest
talking
ever
i
did
there
was
no
response
in
their
faces
they
seemed
as
though
carved
out
of
stone
or
ice
and
i
was
having
a
hard
time
and
wished
i
was
there
and
wished
i
had
promised
to
speak
again
at
night
but
i
had
promised
and
so
i
went
at
night
it
was
the
same
thing
house
full
people
outwardly
respectful
but
no
interest
no
response
and
i
was
having
a
hard
time
again
when
about
through
my
talk
there
came
a
change
it
seemed
as
though
the
windows
of
heaven
had
opened
and
a
bit
of
breath
blew
down
the
atmosphere
of
the
building
seemed
to
change
the
people
faces
changed
it
impressed
me
so
that
when
i
finished
speaking
i
gave
the
invitation
for
those
who
wanted
to
be
christians
to
rise
i
thought
there
might
be
a
few
and
to
my
immense
surprise
the
people
got
up
in
groups
i
turned
to
the
minister
and
said
does
this
mean
he
said
know
i
sure
well
moody
said
they
misunderstood
me
explain
what
i
meant
so
he
announced
an
in
the
room
below
explaining
who
were
invited
only
those
who
wanted
to
be
christians
and
putting
pretty
clearly
what
he
understood
that
to
mean
and
dismissed
the
service
they
went
to
the
lower
room
and
the
people
came
crowding
jamming
in
below
filling
all
available
space
seats
aisles
and
standing
room
moody
talked
again
a
few
minutes
and
then
asked
those
who
would
be
christians
to
rise
this
time
he
knew
he
had
made
his
meaning
clear
they
got
up
in
clumps
in
groups
by
fifties
moody
said
i
turned
and
said
to
the
minister
this
mean
he
said
sure
i
know
then
the
minister
said
to
moody
what
i
do
with
these
people
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
them
this
is
something
new
and
he
said
well
i
announce
a
meeting
for
night
and
tuesday
night
and
see
what
comes
of
it
i
going
across
the
channel
to
dublin
and
he
went
but
he
had
barely
stepped
off
the
boat
when
a
cablegram
was
handed
him
from
the
minister
saying
come
back
at
once
church
packed
so
he
went
back
and
stayed
ten
days
and
the
result
of
that
ten
days
as
i
recall
moody
words
was
that
four
hundred
were
added
to
that
church
and
that
every
church
near
by
felt
the
impulse
of
those
ten
days
then
moody
dropped
his
head
as
though
thinking
back
and
said
i
had
no
plans
beyond
this
church
i
supposed
my
life
work
was
here
but
the
result
with
me
was
that
i
was
given
a
roving
commission
and
have
been
working
under
it
ever
since
now
what
was
the
explanation
of
that
marvellous
sunday
and
days
following
it
was
not
moody
doing
though
he
was
a
leader
whom
god
could
and
did
mightily
use
it
was
not
the
minister
doing
for
he
was
as
greatly
surprised
as
the
leader
there
was
some
secret
hidden
beneath
the
surface
of
those
ten
days
with
his
usual
keenness
moody
set
himself
to
ferret
it
out
by
and
by
this
incident
came
to
him
a
member
of
the
church
a
woman
had
been
taken
sick
some
time
before
then
she
grew
worse
then
the
physician
told
her
that
she
would
not
recover
that
is
she
would
not
die
at
once
so
far
as
he
could
judge
but
she
would
be
shut
in
her
home
for
years
and
she
lay
there
trying
to
think
what
that
meant
to
be
shut
in
for
years
and
she
thought
of
her
life
and
said
how
little
i
done
for
god
practically
nothing
and
now
what
can
i
do
shut
in
here
on
my
back
and
she
said
i
can
pray
may
i
put
this
word
in
here
as
a
parenthesis
in
the
story
that
god
oftentimes
allows
us
to
be
shut
in
he
does
not
shut
us
in
he
does
not
need
to
simply
take
his
hand
off
partly
there
is
enough
disobedience
to
his
law
of
our
bodies
all
the
time
to
shut
us
aside
no
trouble
on
that
side
of
the
problem
pain
to
against
his
own
first
will
for
us
he
allows
us
to
be
shut
in
because
only
so
he
get
our
attention
from
other
things
to
what
he
wants
done
get
us
to
see
things
and
think
things
his
way
i
am
compelled
to
think
it
is
so
she
said
i
pray
and
she
was
led
to
pray
for
her
church
her
sister
also
a
member
of
the
church
lived
with
her
and
was
her
link
with
the
outer
world
sundays
after
church
service
the
sick
woman
would
ask
any
special
interest
in
church
no
was
the
constant
reply
wednesday
nights
after
any
special
interest
in
the
service
there
must
have
been
no
nothing
new
same
old
deacons
made
the
same
old
prayers
but
one
sunday
noon
the
sister
came
in
from
service
and
asked
who
do
you
think
preached
i
do
know
who
why
a
stranger
from
america
a
man
called
moody
i
think
was
the
name
and
the
sick
face
turned
a
bit
whiter
and
her
eye
looked
half
scared
and
her
lip
trembled
a
bit
and
she
quietly
said
i
know
what
that
means
something
coming
to
the
old
church
do
bring
me
any
dinner
i
must
spend
this
afternoon
in
prayer
and
so
she
did
and
that
night
in
the
service
that
startling
change
came
then
to
moody
himself
as
he
sought
her
out
in
her
sick
room
she
told
how
nearly
two
years
before
there
came
into
her
hands
a
copy
of
a
paper
published
in
chicago
called
the
that
contained
a
talk
by
moody
in
one
of
the
chicago
meetings
farwell
hall
meetings
i
think
all
she
knew
was
that
talk
that
made
her
heart
burn
and
there
was
the
name
and
she
was
led
to
pray
that
god
would
send
that
man
into
their
church
in
london
as
simple
a
prayer
as
that
and
the
months
went
by
and
a
year
and
over
still
she
prayed
nobody
knew
of
it
but
herself
and
god
no
change
seemed
to
come
still
she
prayed
and
of
course
her
prayer
wrought
its
purpose
every
prayer
does
and
that
is
the
touchstone
of
true
prayer
and
the
spirit
of
god
moved
that
man
of
god
over
to
the
seaboard
and
across
the
water
and
into
london
and
into
their
church
then
a
bit
of
special
a
sort
of
last
charge
up
the
steep
hill
and
that
night
the
victory
came
do
you
not
believe
i
believe
without
a
doubt
that
some
day
when
the
night
is
gone
and
the
morning
light
comes
up
and
we
know
as
we
are
known
that
we
shall
find
that
the
largest
single
factor
in
that
ten
days
work
and
in
the
changing
of
tens
of
thousands
of
lives
under
moody
leadership
is
that
woman
in
her
praying
not
the
only
factor
mind
you
moody
a
man
of
rare
leadership
and
consecration
and
hundreds
of
faithful
ministers
and
others
rallying
to
his
support
but
behind
and
beneath
moody
and
the
others
and
to
be
reckoned
with
as
first
this
woman
praying
yet
i
do
not
know
her
name
i
know
moody
name
i
could
name
scores
of
faithful
men
associated
with
him
in
his
campaigns
but
the
name
of
this
one
in
whom
humanly
is
the
secret
of
it
all
i
do
not
know
ah
it
is
a
secret
service
we
do
not
know
who
the
great
ones
are
they
tell
me
she
is
living
yet
in
the
north
end
of
london
and
still
praying
shall
we
pray
shall
we
not
pray
if
something
else
must
slip
out
something
important
shall
we
not
see
to
it
that
intercession
has
first
place
u
making
god
purpose
our
with
that
thought
in
mind
let
me
this
evening
suggest
a
bit
of
how
to
pray
as
simple
a
subject
as
that
how
to
pray
the
how
of
method
the
first
thing
in
prayer
is
to
find
god
purpose
the
trend
the
swing
of
it
the
second
thing
to
make
that
purpose
our
prayer
we
want
to
find
out
what
god
is
thinking
and
then
to
claim
that
that
shall
be
done
god
is
seated
up
yonder
on
the
throne
jesus
christ
is
sitting
by
his
side
glorified
everywhere
in
the
universe
god
will
is
being
done
except
in
this
corner
called
the
earth
and
its
atmosphere
and
that
bit
of
the
heavens
above
it
where
satan
headquarters
are
it
has
been
done
down
here
by
one
person
jesus
he
came
here
to
this
prodigal
planet
and
did
god
will
perfectly
he
went
away
and
he
has
sought
and
seeks
to
have
men
down
upon
the
earth
so
fully
in
touch
with
himself
that
he
may
do
in
them
and
through
them
just
what
he
will
that
he
may
reproduce
himself
in
these
men
and
have
god
will
done
again
down
on
the
earth
now
prayer
is
this
finding
out
god
purpose
for
our
lives
and
for
the
earth
and
insisting
that
that
shall
be
done
here
the
great
thing
then
is
to
find
out
and
insist
upon
god
will
and
the
how
of
method
in
prayer
is
concerned
with
that
many
a
time
i
have
met
with
a
group
of
persons
for
prayer
various
special
matters
for
prayer
are
brought
up
here
is
this
man
needing
prayer
and
this
particular
matter
and
this
one
and
this
then
we
kneel
and
pray
and
i
have
many
a
time
thought
not
critically
in
a
bad
sense
as
i
have
listened
to
their
prayers
as
though
this
is
the
prayer
i
must
offer
blessed
holy
spirit
thou
knowest
this
man
and
what
the
lacking
thing
is
in
him
there
is
trouble
there
thou
knowest
this
sick
woman
and
what
the
difficulty
is
there
this
problem
and
what
the
hindrance
is
in
it
blessed
spirit
pray
in
me
the
prayer
thou
art
praying
for
this
man
and
this
thing
and
this
one
the
prayer
thou
art
praying
i
pray
that
in
jesus
name
thy
will
be
done
here
under
these
circumstances
sometimes
i
feel
clear
as
to
the
particular
prayer
to
offer
but
many
a
time
i
am
puzzled
to
know
i
put
this
fact
with
this
but
i
may
not
know
the
facts
i
know
this
man
who
evidently
needs
praying
for
a
christian
man
perhaps
his
mental
characteristics
his
conceptions
of
things
the
kind
of
a
will
he
has
but
there
may
be
some
fact
in
there
that
i
do
not
know
that
seriously
affects
the
whole
difficulty
and
i
am
compelled
to
fall
back
on
this
i
do
know
how
to
pray
as
i
ought
but
the
spirit
within
me
will
make
intercession
for
this
man
as
i
allow
him
to
have
free
swing
in
me
as
the
medium
of
his
prayer
and
he
who
is
listening
above
as
he
hears
his
will
for
this
man
being
repeated
down
on
the
will
recognize
his
own
purpose
of
course
and
so
that
thing
will
be
working
out
because
of
jesus
victory
over
the
evil
one
but
i
may
become
so
sensitive
to
the
spirit
thoughts
and
presence
that
i
shall
know
more
keenly
and
quickly
what
to
pray
for
in
so
far
as
i
do
i
become
a
more
skillful
partner
of
his
on
the
earth
in
getting
god
will
done
u
the
trysting
there
are
six
suggestions
here
on
how
to
pray
first
we
need
for
prayer
unhurried
time
daily
time
time
enough
to
forget
about
how
much
time
it
is
i
do
not
mean
now
rising
in
the
morning
at
the
very
last
moment
and
dressing
it
may
be
hurriedly
and
then
kneeling
a
few
moments
so
as
to
feel
easier
in
mind
not
that
i
do
not
mean
the
last
thing
at
night
when
you
are
jaded
and
fagged
and
almost
between
the
sheets
and
then
remember
and
look
up
a
verse
and
kneel
a
few
moments
not
that
that
is
good
so
far
as
it
goes
i
am
not
criticising
that
better
sweeten
and
sandwich
the
day
with
all
of
that
sort
you
can
get
in
but
just
now
i
mean
this
when
the
mind
is
fresh
and
keen
and
the
spirit
sensitive
to
thoughtfully
pray
we
have
time
life
is
so
crowded
it
must
be
taken
from
something
else
something
important
but
still
less
important
than
this
sacrifice
is
the
continual
law
of
life
the
important
thing
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
more
important
one
needs
to
cultivate
a
mature
judgment
or
his
strength
will
be
frizzled
away
in
the
less
important
details
and
the
greater
thing
go
undone
or
be
done
poorly
with
the
of
strength
if
we
would
become
skilled
intercessors
and
know
how
to
pray
simply
enough
we
must
take
quiet
time
daily
to
get
off
alone
the
second
suggestion
we
need
a
for
prayer
oh
you
can
pray
anywhere
on
the
street
in
the
store
travelling
measuring
dry
goods
hands
in
dishwater
where
not
but
you
are
not
likely
to
unless
you
have
been
off
in
some
quiet
place
shut
in
alone
with
god
the
master
said
enter
into
thine
inner
chamber
and
having
shut
thy
door
that
door
is
important
it
shuts
out
and
it
shuts
in
pray
to
thy
father
who
is
in
secret
god
is
here
in
this
spot
one
must
get
alone
to
find
out
that
he
never
is
alone
the
more
alone
we
are
as
far
as
men
are
concerned
the
least
alone
we
are
so
far
a
god
is
concerned
the
quiet
place
and
time
are
needful
to
train
the
ears
for
keen
hearing
a
mother
will
hear
the
faintest
cry
of
her
babe
just
awaking
it
is
perhaps
the
tiniest
bit
of
a
sound
comes
nobody
else
hears
but
quick
as
a
flash
the
mother
hands
are
held
quiet
the
head
alert
then
she
is
off
her
ears
are
trained
beyond
anybody
else
training
we
need
trained
ears
a
quiet
place
shuts
out
the
outer
sounds
and
gives
the
inner
ear
a
chance
to
learn
other
sounds
a
man
was
standing
in
a
telephone
booth
trying
to
talk
but
could
not
make
out
the
message
he
kept
saying
i
ca
hear
i
ca
hear
the
other
man
by
and
by
said
sharply
if
you
shut
that
door
you
can
hear
door
was
shut
and
he
could
hear
not
only
the
man
voice
but
the
street
and
store
noises
too
some
folks
have
gotten
their
hearing
badly
confused
because
their
doors
have
not
been
shut
enough
man
voice
and
god
voice
get
mixed
in
their
ears
they
can
not
tell
between
them
the
bother
is
partly
with
the
door
if
you
shut
that
door
you
can
hear
the
third
suggestion
needs
much
emphasis
the
book
of
god
its
place
in
prayer
is
not
talking
to
god
simply
it
is
listening
first
then
talking
prayer
needs
three
organs
of
the
head
an
ear
a
tongue
and
an
eye
first
an
ear
to
hear
what
god
says
then
a
tongue
to
speak
then
an
eye
to
look
out
for
the
result
bible
study
is
the
listening
side
of
prayer
the
purpose
of
god
comes
in
through
the
ear
passes
through
the
heart
taking
on
the
tinge
of
your
personality
and
goes
out
at
the
tongue
as
prayer
it
is
pathetic
what
a
time
god
has
getting
a
hearing
down
here
he
is
ever
speaking
but
even
where
there
may
be
some
inclination
to
hear
the
sounds
of
earth
are
choking
in
our
ears
the
sound
of
his
voice
god
speaks
in
his
word
the
most
we
know
of
god
comes
to
us
here
this
book
is
god
in
print
it
was
inspired
and
it
inspired
god
himself
speaks
in
this
book
that
puts
it
in
a
list
by
itself
quite
apart
from
all
others
studying
it
keenly
intelligently
reverently
will
reveal
god
great
will
what
he
says
will
utterly
change
what
you
will
say
u
our
prayer
the
fourth
suggestion
is
this
the
spirit
teach
you
how
to
the
more
you
pray
the
more
you
will
find
yourself
saying
to
yourself
i
know
how
to
pray
well
god
understands
that
paul
knew
that
out
of
his
own
experience
before
he
wrote
it
down
and
god
has
a
plan
to
cover
our
need
there
there
is
one
who
is
a
master
intercessor
he
understands
praying
perfectly
he
is
the
spirit
of
prayer
god
has
sent
him
down
to
live
inside
you
and
me
partly
for
this
to
teach
us
the
fine
art
of
prayer
the
suggestion
is
this
let
him
teach
you
when
you
go
alone
in
the
quiet
time
and
place
with
the
book
quietly
pray
blessed
teach
me
how
to
pray
and
he
will
do
not
be
nervous
or
agitated
wondering
if
you
will
understand
study
to
be
quiet
mind
quiet
body
quiet
be
still
and
listen
remember
version
of
david
words
be
silent
to
god
and
let
him
mould
thee
you
will
find
your
praying
changing
you
will
talk
more
simply
like
a
man
transacting
business
or
a
child
asking
though
of
course
with
a
reverence
and
a
deepness
of
feeling
not
in
those
things
you
will
quit
asking
for
some
things
some
of
the
old
forms
of
prayer
will
drop
from
your
lips
likely
enough
you
will
use
fewer
words
maybe
but
they
will
be
spoken
with
a
quiet
absolute
faith
that
this
thing
you
are
asking
is
being
worked
out
this
thing
of
the
spirit
must
come
first
in
one
praying
and
remain
to
the
last
and
continue
all
along
as
the
leading
dominant
factor
he
is
a
spirit
of
prayer
peculiarly
the
highest
law
of
the
christian
life
is
obedience
to
the
leading
of
the
holy
spirit
there
needs
to
be
a
cultivated
judgment
in
reading
his
leading
and
not
mistaking
our
haphazard
thoughts
as
his
voice
he
should
be
allowed
to
teach
us
how
to
pray
and
more
to
dominate
our
praying
the
whole
range
and
intensity
of
the
spirit
conflict
is
under
his
eye
he
is
god
general
on
the
field
of
action
there
come
crises
in
the
battle
when
the
turn
of
the
tide
wavers
he
knows
when
a
bit
of
special
praying
is
needed
to
turn
the
tide
and
bring
victory
so
there
needs
to
be
special
seasons
of
persistent
prayer
a
continuing
until
victory
is
assured
obey
his
promptings
sometimes
there
comes
an
impulse
to
pray
or
to
ask
another
to
pray
and
we
think
why
i
have
just
been
praying
he
does
pray
about
this
anyway
it
is
not
necessary
to
pray
again
i
do
not
just
like
to
suggest
it
better
obey
the
impulse
quietly
with
fewest
words
of
explanation
to
the
other
one
concerned
or
no
words
beyond
simply
the
request
let
him
this
wondrous
holy
spirit
teach
you
how
to
pray
it
will
take
time
you
may
be
a
bit
set
in
your
way
but
if
you
will
just
yield
and
patiently
wait
he
will
teach
what
to
pray
suggest
definite
things
and
often
the
very
language
of
prayer
you
will
notice
that
the
chief
purpose
of
these
four
suggestions
is
to
learn
god
will
the
quiet
place
the
quiet
time
the
book
the
spirit
this
is
the
schoolroom
as
andrew
murray
would
finely
put
it
here
we
learn
his
will
learning
that
makes
one
eager
to
have
it
done
and
breathes
anew
the
longing
prayer
that
it
may
be
done
there
is
a
fine
word
much
used
in
the
psalms
and
in
isaiah
for
this
sort
of
thing
over
and
over
again
that
is
the
word
used
for
that
contact
with
god
which
reveals
to
us
his
will
and
imparts
to
us
anew
his
desires
it
is
a
word
full
of
richest
and
deepest
meaning
waiting
is
not
an
occasional
nor
a
hurried
thing
it
means
that
is
holding
on
that
is
holding
back
that
is
holding
the
face
up
to
see
that
is
holding
one
self
in
readiness
to
go
or
do
it
means
that
is
holding
quiet
and
still
so
as
to
hear
u
the
power
of
a
the
fifth
suggestion
has
already
been
referred
to
but
should
be
repeated
here
prayer
must
be
jesus
the
relationship
of
prayer
is
through
jesus
and
the
prayer
itself
must
be
offered
in
his
name
because
the
whole
strength
of
the
case
lies
in
jesus
i
recall
distinctly
a
certain
section
of
this
country
where
i
was
for
awhile
and
very
rarely
did
i
hear
jesus
name
used
in
prayer
i
heard
men
that
i
knew
must
be
good
men
praying
in
church
in
and
elsewhere
with
no
mention
of
jesus
let
us
distinctly
bear
in
mind
that
we
have
no
standing
with
god
except
through
jesus
if
the
keenest
lawyer
of
london
who
knew
more
of
american
law
and
of
illinois
statute
and
of
chicago
ordinance
suppose
such
a
case
were
to
come
here
could
he
plead
a
case
in
your
you
know
he
could
not
he
would
have
no
legal
standing
here
now
you
and
i
have
no
standing
at
yonder
bar
we
are
disbarred
through
sin
only
as
we
come
through
one
who
has
recognized
standing
there
can
we
come
but
turn
that
fact
around
as
we
do
come
in
jesus
name
it
is
the
same
as
though
jesus
prayed
it
is
the
same
as
though
let
me
be
saying
it
very
softly
so
it
may
seem
very
reverent
as
though
jesus
put
his
arm
in
yours
and
took
you
up
to
the
father
and
said
father
here
is
a
friend
of
mine
we
on
good
terms
please
give
him
anything
he
asks
for
my
sake
and
the
father
would
quickly
bend
over
and
graciously
say
what
you
have
you
may
have
anything
you
ask
when
my
son
asks
for
it
that
is
the
practical
effect
of
asking
in
jesus
name
but
i
am
very
very
clear
of
this
and
i
keep
swinging
back
to
it
that
in
the
ultimate
analysis
the
force
of
using
jesus
name
is
that
he
is
the
victor
over
the
traitor
prince
prayer
is
repeating
the
victor
name
into
the
ears
of
satan
and
insisting
upon
his
retreat
as
one
prays
persistently
in
jesus
name
the
evil
one
must
go
reluctantly
angrily
he
must
loosen
his
clutches
and
go
back
u
the
birthplace
of
the
sixth
suggestion
is
a
familiar
one
and
yet
one
much
misunderstood
prayer
must
be
but
please
note
that
faith
here
is
not
believing
that
god
but
that
he
it
is
kneeling
and
making
the
prayer
and
then
saying
father
i
thank
thee
for
this
that
it
will
be
so
i
thank
thee
then
rising
and
going
about
your
duties
saying
that
thing
is
settled
going
again
and
again
and
repeating
the
prayer
with
the
thanks
and
then
saying
as
you
go
off
that
matter
is
assured
not
going
repeatedly
to
persuade
god
but
because
prayer
is
the
deciding
factor
in
a
spirit
conflict
and
each
prayer
is
like
a
fresh
blow
between
the
eyes
of
the
enemy
a
fresh
broadside
from
your
fleet
upon
the
fort
well
some
one
will
say
now
you
are
getting
that
keyed
up
rather
high
can
we
all
have
faith
like
that
can
a
man
himself
believe
there
should
be
no
unnatural
mechanical
insisting
that
you
do
believe
some
earnest
people
make
a
mistake
there
and
we
will
not
all
have
faith
like
that
that
is
quite
true
and
i
can
easily
tell
you
why
the
faith
that
believes
that
god
do
what
you
ask
is
not
born
in
a
hurry
it
is
not
born
in
the
dust
of
the
street
and
the
noise
of
the
crowd
but
i
can
tell
where
that
faith
will
have
a
birthplace
and
keep
growing
stronger
in
every
heart
that
takes
quiet
time
off
habitually
with
god
and
listens
to
his
voice
in
his
word
into
that
heart
will
come
a
simple
strong
faith
that
the
thing
it
is
led
to
ask
shall
be
accomplished
that
faith
has
four
simple
characteristics
it
is
it
finds
out
what
god
will
is
faith
is
never
contrary
to
reason
sometimes
it
is
a
bit
higher
up
the
reasoning
process
has
not
yet
reached
up
to
it
second
it
is
it
fits
its
life
into
god
will
there
is
apt
to
be
a
stiff
rub
here
all
the
time
then
it
is
it
looks
out
for
the
result
it
bows
down
upon
the
earth
but
sends
a
man
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
sea
and
then
it
is
it
hangs
on
it
says
go
again
seven
times
seventy
times
seven
it
reasons
that
having
learned
god
will
and
knowing
that
he
does
not
change
the
delay
must
be
caused
by
the
third
person
the
enemy
and
that
stubborn
persistence
in
the
victor
name
routs
him
and
leaves
a
clear
field
the
listening
side
of
prayer
u
a
trained
in
prayer
the
ear
is
an
organ
of
first
importance
it
is
of
equal
importance
with
the
tongue
but
must
be
named
first
for
the
ear
leads
the
way
to
the
tongue
the
child
hears
a
word
before
it
speaks
it
through
the
ear
comes
the
use
of
the
tongue
where
the
faculties
are
normal
the
tongue
is
trained
only
through
the
ear
this
is
nature
method
the
mind
is
moulded
largely
through
the
ear
and
eye
it
reveals
itself
and
asserts
itself
largely
through
the
tongue
what
the
ear
lets
in
the
mind
works
over
and
the
tongue
gives
out
this
is
the
order
in
isaiah
fiftieth
chapter
in
those
words
prophetic
of
jesus
the
lord
god
hath
given
me
the
tongue
of
them
that
are
taught
he
wakeneth
my
ear
to
hear
as
they
that
are
taught
here
the
taught
tongue
came
through
the
awakened
ear
one
reason
why
so
many
of
us
do
not
have
taught
tongues
is
because
we
give
god
so
little
chance
at
our
ears
it
is
a
striking
fact
that
the
men
who
have
been
mightiest
in
prayer
have
known
god
well
they
have
seemed
peculiarly
sensitive
to
him
and
to
be
overawed
with
the
sense
of
his
love
and
his
greatness
there
are
three
of
the
old
testament
characters
who
are
particularly
mentioned
as
being
mighty
in
prayer
jeremiah
tells
that
when
god
spoke
to
him
about
the
deep
perversity
of
that
nation
he
exclaimed
though
moses
and
samuel
stood
before
me
my
heart
could
not
be
towards
this
people
when
james
wants
an
illustration
of
a
man
of
prayer
for
the
scattered
jews
he
speaks
of
elijah
and
of
one
particular
crisis
in
his
life
the
praying
on
these
three
men
are
israel
great
men
in
the
great
crises
of
its
history
moses
was
the
maker
and
moulder
of
the
nation
samuel
was
the
patient
teacher
who
introduced
a
new
order
of
things
in
the
national
life
elijah
was
the
rugged
leader
when
the
national
worship
of
jehovah
was
about
to
be
officially
overthrown
these
three
men
the
maker
the
teacher
the
emergency
leader
are
singled
out
in
the
record
as
peculiarly
men
of
prayer
now
regarding
these
men
it
is
most
interesting
to
observe
what
they
were
to
god
voice
their
ears
were
trained
early
and
trained
long
until
great
acuteness
and
sensitiveness
to
god
voice
was
the
result
special
pains
seem
to
have
been
taken
with
the
first
man
the
greatest
giant
and
history
greatest
jurist
there
were
two
distinct
stages
in
the
training
of
his
ears
first
there
were
the
forty
years
of
solitude
in
the
desert
sands
alone
with
the
sheep
and
the
stars
and
god
his
ears
were
being
trained
by
silence
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
egypt
busy
life
were
being
taken
out
of
his
ears
how
silent
are
god
voices
how
few
men
are
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
endure
silence
for
in
silence
god
is
speaking
to
the
inner
ear
let
us
then
labour
for
an
inward
stillness
an
inward
stillness
and
an
inward
healing
that
perfect
silence
where
the
lips
and
heart
are
still
and
we
no
longer
entertain
our
own
imperfect
thoughts
and
vain
opinions
but
god
alone
speaks
in
us
and
we
wait
in
singleness
of
heart
that
we
may
know
his
will
and
in
the
silence
of
our
spirits
that
we
may
do
his
will
and
do
that
only
a
gentleman
was
asked
by
an
artist
friend
of
some
note
to
come
to
his
home
and
see
a
painting
just
finished
he
went
at
the
time
appointed
was
shown
by
the
attendant
into
a
room
which
was
quite
dark
and
left
there
he
was
much
surprised
but
quietly
waited
developments
after
perhaps
fifteen
minutes
his
friend
came
into
the
room
with
a
cordial
greeting
and
took
him
up
to
the
studio
to
see
the
painting
which
was
greatly
admired
before
he
left
the
artist
said
laughingly
i
suppose
you
thought
it
queer
to
be
left
in
that
dark
room
so
long
yes
the
visitor
said
i
did
well
his
friend
replied
i
knew
that
if
you
came
into
my
studio
with
the
glare
of
the
street
in
your
eyes
you
could
not
appreciate
the
fine
colouring
of
the
picture
so
i
left
you
in
the
dark
room
till
the
glare
had
worn
out
of
your
eyes
the
first
stage
of
moses
was
wearing
the
noise
of
egypt
out
of
his
ears
so
he
could
hear
the
quiet
fine
tones
of
god
voice
he
who
would
become
skilled
in
prayer
must
take
a
silence
course
in
the
university
of
arabia
then
came
the
second
stage
forty
years
were
followed
by
forty
days
twice
over
of
listening
to
god
speaking
voice
up
in
the
mount
such
an
as
that
made
a
skilled
famous
intercessor
samuel
had
an
earlier
course
than
moses
while
yet
a
child
before
his
ears
had
been
dulled
by
earth
sounds
they
were
tuned
to
the
hearing
of
voice
the
child
heart
and
ear
naturally
open
upward
they
hear
easily
and
believe
readily
the
roadway
of
the
ear
has
not
been
beaten
down
hard
by
much
travel
god
rains
and
dews
have
made
it
soft
and
impressionable
this
child
ear
was
quickly
trained
to
recognize
god
voice
and
the
tented
hebrew
nation
soon
came
to
know
that
there
was
a
man
in
their
midst
to
whom
god
was
talking
o
to
keep
the
heart
and
inner
ear
of
a
child
as
mature
years
come
of
the
third
of
these
famous
intercessors
little
is
known
except
of
the
few
striking
events
in
which
he
figured
of
these
the
scene
that
finds
its
climax
in
the
opening
on
carmel
top
of
the
occupies
by
far
the
greater
space
and
it
is
notable
that
the
beginning
of
that
long
eighteenth
chapter
of
first
kings
which
tells
of
the
carmel
conflict
begins
with
a
message
to
elijah
from
god
the
word
of
the
lord
came
to
elijah
i
will
send
rain
upon
the
earth
that
was
the
foundation
of
that
persistent
praying
and
sevenfold
watching
on
the
mountaintop
first
the
ear
heard
then
the
voice
persistently
claimed
and
the
eye
expectantly
looked
first
the
voice
of
god
then
the
voice
of
man
that
is
the
true
order
tremendous
results
always
follow
that
combination
u
through
the
book
to
with
us
the
training
is
of
the
ear
and
its
first
training
after
the
early
childhood
stage
is
passed
must
usually
be
through
the
eye
what
god
has
spoken
to
others
has
been
written
down
for
us
we
hear
through
our
eyes
the
eye
opens
the
way
to
the
inner
ear
god
spoke
in
his
word
he
is
still
speaking
in
it
and
through
it
the
whole
thought
here
is
to
get
know
he
reveals
himself
in
the
word
that
comes
from
his
own
lips
and
through
his
messengers
lips
he
reveals
himself
in
his
dealings
with
men
every
incident
and
experience
of
these
pages
is
a
mirror
held
up
to
god
face
in
them
we
may
come
to
see
him
this
is
studying
the
bible
not
for
the
bible
sake
but
for
the
purpose
of
knowing
god
the
object
aimed
at
is
not
the
book
but
the
god
revealed
in
the
book
a
man
may
go
to
college
and
take
lectures
on
the
english
bible
and
increase
his
knowledge
and
enrich
his
vocabulary
and
go
away
with
utterly
erroneous
ideas
of
god
he
may
go
to
a
law
school
and
study
the
codes
of
the
first
great
jurist
and
get
a
clear
understanding
and
firm
grasp
of
the
mosaic
enactments
as
he
must
do
to
lay
the
foundation
of
legal
training
yet
he
may
remain
ignorant
of
god
he
may
even
go
to
a
bible
school
and
be
able
to
analyze
and
synthesize
give
outlines
of
books
and
contents
of
chapters
and
much
else
of
that
invaluable
and
indispensable
sort
of
knowledge
and
yet
fail
to
understand
god
and
his
marvellous
it
is
not
the
book
with
which
we
are
concerned
here
but
the
god
through
the
book
not
to
learn
truth
but
through
truth
to
know
him
who
is
himself
the
truth
there
is
a
fascinating
bit
of
story
told
of
one
of
david
mighty
men
one
day
there
was
a
sudden
attack
upon
the
camp
by
the
philistines
when
the
fighting
men
were
all
away
this
man
alone
was
there
the
philistines
were
the
traditional
enemy
the
very
word
philistines
was
one
to
strike
terror
to
the
hebrew
heart
but
this
man
was
reckoned
one
of
the
first
three
of
david
mighty
men
because
of
his
conduct
that
day
he
quietly
quickly
gripped
his
sword
and
fought
the
enemy
up
and
down
left
and
right
hip
and
thigh
he
smote
with
such
terrific
earnestness
and
drive
that
the
enemy
turned
and
fled
and
we
are
told
that
the
muscles
of
his
hand
became
so
rigid
around
the
handle
of
his
sword
that
he
could
not
tell
by
the
feeling
where
his
hand
stopped
and
the
sword
began
man
and
sword
were
one
that
day
in
the
action
of
service
against
the
enemy
when
we
so
absorb
this
book
and
the
spirit
of
him
who
is
its
life
that
people
can
not
tell
the
line
of
division
between
the
man
and
the
god
within
the
man
then
shall
we
have
mightiest
power
as
god
intercessors
in
defeating
the
foe
god
and
man
will
be
as
one
in
the
action
of
service
against
the
enemy
u
a
spirit
illumined
i
want
to
make
some
simple
suggestions
for
studying
this
book
so
as
to
get
to
god
through
it
there
will
be
the
emphasis
of
doubling
back
on
tracks
here
for
some
of
the
things
that
should
be
said
have
already
been
said
with
a
different
setting
first
there
must
be
the
element
one
must
get
at
least
a
half
hour
daily
when
the
mind
is
fresh
a
tired
mind
does
not
readily
this
should
be
persisted
in
until
there
is
a
habitual
spending
of
at
least
that
much
time
daily
over
the
book
with
a
spirit
at
leisure
from
all
else
so
it
can
take
in
then
the
time
should
be
given
to
book
if
other
books
are
consulted
and
read
as
they
will
be
let
that
be
the
reading
of
this
book
let
god
talk
to
you
direct
rather
than
through
somebody
else
give
him
first
chance
at
your
ears
this
book
in
the
central
place
of
your
table
the
others
grouped
about
it
first
time
given
to
it
a
third
suggestion
brings
out
the
circle
of
this
work
we
learn
how
to
pray
by
reading
prayerfully
this
book
does
not
reveal
its
sweets
and
strength
to
the
keen
mind
merely
but
to
the
spirit
enlightened
mind
all
the
mental
keenness
possible
the
bright
light
of
the
spirit
that
is
the
open
sesame
i
have
sometimes
sought
the
meaning
of
some
passage
from
a
keen
scholar
who
could
explain
the
orientalisms
the
fine
philological
distinctions
the
most
accurate
translations
and
all
of
that
who
yet
did
not
seem
to
know
the
simple
spiritual
meaning
of
the
words
being
discussed
and
i
have
asked
the
same
question
of
some
old
saint
of
god
who
did
not
know
hebrew
from
a
tracks
but
who
seemed
to
sense
at
once
the
deep
spiritual
truth
taught
the
more
knowledge
the
keener
the
mind
the
better
illumined
by
the
spirit
that
inspired
these
writings
there
is
a
fourth
word
to
put
in
here
we
must
read
thoughtfulness
is
in
danger
of
being
a
lost
art
newspapers
are
so
numerous
and
literature
so
abundant
that
we
are
becoming
a
bright
but
a
people
often
the
stream
is
very
wide
but
has
no
depth
fight
shallowness
insist
on
reading
thoughtfully
a
very
suggestive
word
in
the
bible
for
this
is
run
through
and
pick
out
this
word
with
its
variations
the
word
underneath
that
english
word
means
to
mutter
as
though
a
man
were
repeating
something
over
and
over
again
as
he
turned
it
over
in
his
mind
we
have
another
word
with
the
same
meaning
not
much
used
now
ruminate
we
call
the
cow
a
ruminant
because
she
chews
the
cud
she
will
spend
hours
chewing
the
cud
and
then
give
us
the
rich
milk
and
cream
and
butter
which
she
has
extracted
from
her
food
that
is
the
word
here
ruminate
chew
the
cud
if
you
would
get
the
richest
cream
and
butter
here
and
it
is
remarkable
how
much
chewing
this
book
of
god
will
stand
in
comparison
with
other
books
you
chew
a
while
on
tennyson
or
browning
or
longfellow
and
i
am
not
belittling
these
noble
writings
i
have
my
own
favourite
among
these
men
but
they
do
not
yield
the
richest
and
yet
richer
cream
found
here
this
book
of
god
has
stood
more
of
that
sort
of
thing
than
any
other
yet
it
is
the
freshest
book
to
be
found
you
read
a
passage
over
the
two
hundredth
time
and
some
new
fine
bit
of
meaning
comes
that
you
had
not
suspected
to
be
there
there
is
a
fifth
suggestion
that
is
easier
to
make
than
to
follow
as
the
truth
appeals
to
your
conscience
it
change
your
habit
and
light
obeyed
increased
light
light
resisted
bringeth
night
who
shall
give
us
power
to
choose
if
the
love
of
light
we
lose
jesus
gives
the
law
of
knowledge
in
his
famous
words
if
any
man
willeth
to
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
teaching
if
we
do
what
we
know
to
do
we
will
know
more
if
we
know
to
do
and
hesitate
and
hold
back
and
do
not
obey
the
inner
eye
will
surely
go
blind
and
the
sense
of
right
be
dulled
and
lost
obedience
to
truth
is
the
eye
of
the
mind
u
wide
then
one
needs
to
have
a
of
reading
a
consecutive
plan
gathers
up
the
fragments
of
time
into
a
strong
whole
get
a
good
plan
and
stick
to
it
better
a
fairly
good
plan
faithfully
followed
than
the
best
plan
if
used
brokenly
or
only
occasionally
probably
all
the
numerous
methods
of
study
may
be
grouped
under
three
general
heads
wide
reading
topical
study
and
textual
we
all
do
some
textual
study
in
a
more
or
less
small
way
digging
into
a
sentence
or
verse
to
get
at
its
true
and
deep
meaning
we
all
do
some
topical
study
probably
gathering
up
statements
on
some
one
subject
studying
a
character
the
more
pretentious
name
is
biblical
theology
finding
and
arranging
all
that
is
taught
in
the
whole
range
of
the
bible
on
any
one
theme
but
i
want
especially
to
urge
as
being
the
basis
of
all
study
it
is
the
simple
the
natural
the
scientific
method
it
is
adapted
to
all
classes
of
persons
i
used
to
suppose
it
was
suited
best
to
college
students
and
such
but
i
was
mistaken
it
is
method
of
all
for
all
it
underlies
all
methods
of
getting
a
grasp
of
this
wonderful
book
and
so
coming
to
as
full
and
rounded
an
understanding
of
god
as
is
possible
to
men
down
here
by
wide
reading
is
meant
a
reading
regardless
of
verse
chapter
or
book
divisions
reading
it
as
a
story
as
you
would
read
any
book
the
siege
of
pekin
the
story
of
an
untold
love
to
find
out
the
story
told
and
be
able
to
tell
to
another
there
will
be
a
reverence
of
spirit
with
this
book
that
no
other
inspires
but
with
the
same
intellectual
method
of
running
through
to
see
what
is
here
no
book
is
so
fascinating
as
the
bible
when
read
this
way
the
revised
version
is
greatly
to
be
preferred
here
simply
because
it
is
a
version
it
is
printed
more
like
other
books
some
day
its
printed
form
will
be
yet
more
modernized
and
so
made
easier
to
read
to
illustrate
begin
at
the
first
of
genesis
and
read
rapidly
through
the
do
not
try
to
understand
all
you
will
not
never
mind
that
now
just
push
on
do
not
try
to
remember
all
do
not
think
about
that
let
stick
to
you
what
will
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
much
will
you
may
read
ten
or
twelve
pages
in
your
first
half
hour
next
time
start
in
where
you
left
off
you
may
get
through
genesis
in
three
or
four
times
or
less
or
more
depending
on
your
mood
and
how
fast
your
habit
of
reading
may
be
you
will
find
a
whole
bible
in
genesis
a
wonderfully
fascinating
book
this
genesis
for
love
stories
plotting
swift
action
beautiful
language
it
more
than
matches
the
popular
novel
but
do
not
stop
at
the
close
of
genesis
push
on
into
exodus
the
connection
is
immediate
it
is
the
same
book
and
so
on
into
leviticus
now
do
not
try
to
understand
leviticus
the
first
time
you
will
not
the
hundredth
time
perhaps
but
you
can
easily
group
its
contents
these
chapters
tell
of
the
offerings
these
of
the
law
of
offerings
here
is
an
incident
put
in
here
sanitary
regulations
get
the
drift
of
the
book
and
in
it
all
be
getting
the
picture
of
god
is
the
one
and
so
on
through
a
second
stage
of
this
wide
reading
is
fitting
together
the
parts
you
know
the
arrangement
of
our
bible
is
not
chronological
wholly
but
topical
the
western
mind
is
almost
a
slave
to
chronological
order
but
the
oriental
was
not
so
disturbed
for
example
open
your
bible
to
the
close
of
esther
and
again
at
the
close
of
malachi
this
from
genesis
to
esther
we
all
know
is
the
historical
section
and
this
second
section
the
poetical
and
prophetical
section
there
is
some
history
in
the
prophecy
and
some
prophecy
and
poetry
in
the
historical
part
but
in
the
main
this
first
is
historical
and
this
second
poetry
and
prophecy
these
two
parts
belong
together
this
first
section
was
not
written
and
then
this
second
the
second
belongs
in
between
the
leaves
of
the
first
it
was
taken
out
and
put
by
itself
because
the
arrangement
of
the
whole
book
is
topical
rather
than
chronological
now
the
second
stage
of
wide
reading
is
this
fit
these
parts
together
fit
the
poetry
and
the
prophecy
into
the
history
do
it
on
your
own
account
as
though
it
had
never
been
done
it
has
been
done
much
better
than
you
will
do
it
and
you
will
make
some
mistakes
you
can
check
those
up
afterwards
by
some
of
the
scholarly
books
and
you
can
not
tell
where
some
parts
belong
but
meanwhile
the
thing
to
note
is
this
you
are
absorbing
the
book
it
is
becoming
a
part
of
you
bone
of
your
bone
and
flesh
of
your
flesh
mentally
and
spiritually
you
are
drinking
in
its
spirit
in
huge
draughts
there
is
coming
a
new
vision
of
god
which
will
transform
radically
the
reverent
student
in
it
all
seek
to
acquire
historical
that
is
put
yourself
back
and
see
what
this
thing
or
this
meant
to
these
men
as
it
was
first
spoken
under
these
immediate
circumstances
and
so
push
on
into
the
new
testament
do
not
try
so
much
to
fit
the
four
gospels
into
one
connected
story
dovetailing
all
the
parts
but
try
rather
to
get
a
clear
grasp
of
jesus
movements
those
few
years
as
told
by
these
four
men
fit
paul
letters
into
the
book
of
acts
the
best
you
can
the
best
book
to
help
in
checking
up
here
is
conybeare
and
life
and
letters
of
st
paul
that
may
well
be
one
of
the
books
in
your
collection
you
see
at
once
that
this
is
a
method
not
for
a
month
nor
for
a
year
but
for
years
the
topical
and
textual
study
grow
naturally
out
of
it
and
meanwhile
you
are
getting
an
intelligent
grasp
of
this
wondrous
classic
you
are
absorbing
the
finest
literature
in
the
english
tongue
and
infinitely
better
yet
you
are
breathing
into
your
very
being
a
new
deep
broad
tender
conception
of
u
a
mirror
held
up
to
god
it
is
simply
fascinating
too
to
find
what
light
floods
these
pages
as
they
are
read
back
in
their
historical
setting
so
far
as
that
is
possible
for
example
turn
to
the
third
psalm
fifth
verse
i
laid
me
down
and
slept
i
awaked
for
the
lord
sustaineth
me
i
was
brought
up
in
an
church
where
that
was
sung
i
knew
it
by
heart
as
a
boy
i
supposed
it
meant
that
had
come
and
david
was
sleepy
he
had
his
devotions
and
went
to
bed
and
had
a
good
sleep
that
was
all
it
had
suggested
to
me
but
on
my
first
swing
through
of
the
wide
reading
my
eye
was
caught
as
doubtless
yours
has
often
been
by
the
inscription
at
the
beginning
of
the
psalm
a
psalm
of
david
he
fled
from
absalom
his
quickly
i
turned
back
to
second
samuel
to
find
that
story
and
i
got
this
picture
david
an
old
man
hurrying
one
day
barefooted
out
of
his
palace
and
his
capital
city
with
a
few
faithful
friends
fleeing
for
his
life
because
absalom
his
favourite
son
was
coming
with
the
strength
of
the
national
army
to
take
the
kingdom
and
his
own
father
life
and
that
night
as
the
king
lay
down
to
try
to
catch
some
sleep
it
was
upon
the
bare
earth
with
only
heaven
blue
dome
for
a
roof
and
as
he
lay
he
could
almost
hear
the
steady
tramp
tramp
of
the
army
over
the
hills
seeking
his
throne
and
his
life
let
me
ask
you
honestly
now
do
you
think
you
would
have
slept
much
that
night
i
fear
i
would
have
been
tempted
sorely
to
lie
awake
thinking
here
i
am
an
old
man
driven
from
my
kingdom
and
my
home
by
my
own
boy
that
i
have
loved
better
than
my
own
life
do
you
think
would
have
slept
much
tell
me
but
david
speaking
of
that
night
afterwards
wrote
this
down
i
laid
me
down
and
i
the
thought
is
i
awaked
for
the
lord
sustaineth
me
and
i
thought
as
first
that
came
to
me
i
never
will
have
insomnia
again
i
trust
and
so
you
see
a
lesson
of
trust
in
god
came
in
my
wide
reading
out
of
the
historical
setting
that
greatly
refreshed
and
strengthened
and
that
i
have
never
forgotten
what
a
god
to
give
sleep
under
such
circumstances
a
fine
illustration
of
this
same
thing
is
found
in
the
new
testament
in
paul
letter
to
the
philippians
at
one
end
of
that
epistle
is
this
scene
paul
lying
in
the
inner
damp
cell
of
a
prison
its
small
creeping
denizens
familiarly
examining
this
newcomer
in
the
darkness
of
midnight
his
back
bleeding
from
the
stripes
his
bones
aching
and
his
feet
fast
in
the
stocks
that
is
one
half
of
the
historical
setting
of
this
book
and
here
is
the
other
half
paul
a
prisoner
in
rome
if
he
tries
to
ease
his
body
by
changing
his
position
swinging
one
limb
over
the
other
a
chain
dangling
at
his
ankle
reminds
him
of
the
soldier
by
his
side
as
he
picks
up
a
quill
to
put
a
last
loving
word
out
of
his
tender
heart
for
these
old
friends
a
chain
pulls
at
his
wrist
that
is
philippians
the
prison
epistle
resounding
with
clanking
chain
what
is
the
keyword
of
the
book
occurring
oftener
than
any
other
patience
surely
that
would
be
appropriate
still
more
fitting
would
that
seem
but
no
the
keyword
stands
in
sharpest
contrast
to
these
surroundings
paul
used
clouds
to
make
the
sun
shining
more
beautiful
joy
rejoice
rejoicing
is
the
music
singing
all
the
way
through
these
four
chapters
what
a
wondrous
master
this
jesus
so
to
inspire
his
friend
doing
his
will
every
incident
and
occurrence
of
these
pages
becomes
a
mirror
held
up
to
god
face
that
we
may
see
how
wondrous
he
is
upon
thy
word
i
rest
each
pilgrim
day
this
golden
staff
is
best
for
all
the
way
what
jesus
christ
hath
spoken
can
not
be
broken
upon
thy
word
i
rest
so
strong
so
sure
so
full
of
comfort
blest
so
sweet
so
pure
the
charter
of
salvation
faith
broad
foundation
upon
thy
word
i
stand
that
can
not
die
christ
seals
it
in
my
hand
he
can
not
lie
thy
word
that
faileth
never
abiding
ever
something
about
god
will
in
connection
with
prayer
u
he
came
to
his
the
purpose
of
prayer
is
to
get
god
will
done
what
a
stranger
god
is
in
his
own
world
nobody
is
so
much
slandered
as
he
he
comes
to
his
own
and
they
keep
him
standing
outside
the
door
like
a
pilgrim
of
the
night
staff
in
hand
while
they
peer
suspiciously
at
him
through
the
crack
of
the
hinges
some
of
us
shrink
back
from
making
a
full
surrender
of
life
to
god
and
if
the
real
reason
were
known
it
would
be
found
to
be
that
we
are
of
god
we
fear
he
will
put
something
bitter
in
the
cup
or
some
rough
thing
in
the
road
and
without
doubt
the
reason
we
are
afraid
of
god
is
because
we
do
not
god
the
great
prayer
of
jesus
heart
that
night
with
the
eleven
was
that
they
may
thee
the
only
true
god
and
jesus
christ
whom
thou
didst
send
to
understand
god
will
we
must
understand
something
of
his
character
himself
there
are
five
common
words
i
want
to
bring
you
to
suggest
something
of
who
god
is
they
are
familiar
words
in
constant
use
the
first
is
the
word
father
stands
for
strength
loving
strength
a
father
plans
and
provides
for
and
protects
his
loved
ones
all
fathers
are
not
good
how
man
can
extract
the
meaning
out
of
a
fine
word
and
use
the
word
without
its
meaning
if
you
will
think
of
the
finest
father
ever
you
knew
that
anybody
ever
had
think
of
him
now
then
remember
this
god
is
a
father
only
he
is
so
much
finer
a
father
than
the
finest
father
you
ever
knew
of
and
his
will
for
your
i
am
not
talking
about
heaven
and
our
souls
just
now
that
is
in
it
too
his
will
for
your
life
down
here
these
days
is
a
father
will
for
the
one
most
dearly
loved
the
second
word
is
a
finer
word
because
woman
is
finer
than
man
and
was
made
and
meant
to
be
this
second
word
is
finer
than
the
first
i
mean
the
word
if
father
stands
for
strength
mother
stands
for
love
great
patient
tender
enduring
love
what
would
she
not
do
for
her
loved
one
why
not
unlikely
she
went
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
that
that
life
might
come
and
did
it
gladly
with
the
shining
out
of
her
eyes
yes
and
would
do
it
again
that
the
life
may
remain
if
need
be
that
is
a
mother
you
think
of
the
finest
mother
ever
you
knew
and
the
suggestion
brings
the
most
hallowed
memories
to
my
own
heart
then
remember
this
god
is
a
mother
only
he
is
so
much
finer
a
mother
than
the
finest
mother
you
ever
knew
the
references
in
scripture
to
god
as
a
mother
are
numerous
under
his
wings
is
a
mother
figure
the
gathers
her
brood
up
under
her
wings
to
feel
the
heat
of
her
body
and
for
protection
the
word
mother
is
not
used
for
god
in
the
bible
i
think
it
is
because
with
god
father
includes
mother
it
takes
more
of
the
human
to
tell
the
story
than
of
the
divine
with
god
all
the
strength
of
the
father
and
all
the
fine
love
of
the
mother
are
combined
in
that
word
father
and
his
will
for
us
is
a
mother
will
a
wise
loving
mother
will
for
the
darling
of
her
heart
the
third
word
is
i
do
not
mean
to
use
it
in
the
cheaper
meaning
there
is
a
certain
kindliness
of
speech
in
which
all
acquaintances
are
called
friends
tupper
says
we
call
all
men
friends
who
are
not
known
to
be
enemies
but
i
mean
to
use
the
word
in
its
finer
meaning
here
a
friend
is
one
who
loves
you
for
your
sake
only
and
steadfastly
loves
without
regard
to
any
return
even
a
the
english
have
a
saying
that
you
may
fill
a
church
with
your
acquaintances
and
not
fill
the
pulpit
seats
with
your
friends
if
you
may
have
in
your
life
one
or
two
real
friends
you
are
very
wealthy
if
you
will
think
for
a
moment
of
the
very
best
friend
you
ever
knew
anybody
to
have
then
remember
this
god
is
a
friend
only
he
is
ever
so
much
better
a
friend
than
the
best
friend
you
ever
knew
of
and
the
plan
he
has
thought
out
for
your
life
is
such
a
one
as
that
word
would
suggest
the
fourth
word
i
almost
hesitate
to
use
yet
i
am
sure
i
need
not
here
the
hesitancy
is
because
the
word
and
its
relationship
are
spoken
of
lightly
frivolously
so
much
even
in
good
circles
i
mean
that
rare
fine
word
where
two
have
met
and
acquaintance
has
deepened
into
friendship
and
that
in
turn
into
the
holiest
emotion
the
highest
friendship
what
would
he
not
do
for
her
she
becomes
the
new
human
centre
of
his
life
in
a
good
sense
he
worships
the
ground
she
treads
upon
and
she
she
will
leave
wealth
for
poverty
if
only
so
she
may
be
with
him
in
the
coming
days
she
will
leave
home
and
friends
and
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
if
his
service
calls
him
there
you
think
of
the
finest
lover
man
or
woman
you
ever
knew
anybody
to
have
then
remember
this
and
let
me
say
it
in
soft
reverent
tones
god
is
a
lover
shall
i
say
in
yet
more
reverent
voice
a
only
he
is
so
much
finer
a
lover
than
the
finest
lover
you
ever
knew
of
and
his
will
his
plan
for
your
life
and
mine
it
hushes
my
heart
to
say
it
is
a
lover
plan
for
his
only
loved
one
the
fifth
word
is
this
fourth
word
a
degree
finer
spun
a
stage
farther
on
and
higher
up
the
word
this
is
the
word
on
the
man
side
for
the
most
hallowed
relationship
of
earth
this
is
the
lover
relationship
in
its
perfection
stage
with
men
husband
is
not
always
a
finer
word
than
lover
the
more
the
pity
how
man
does
cheapen
plan
of
things
leaves
out
the
kernel
and
keeps
only
an
empty
shell
sometimes
in
god
thought
a
husband
is
a
lover
he
is
all
that
the
finest
lover
is
and
more
more
tender
more
eager
more
thoughtful
two
lives
are
joined
and
begin
living
one
life
two
wills
yet
one
two
persons
yet
one
purpose
duality
in
unity
will
you
call
to
mind
for
a
moment
the
best
husband
you
ever
knew
any
woman
to
have
then
remember
this
that
god
is
a
husband
only
he
is
an
infinitely
more
thoughtful
husband
than
any
you
ever
knew
and
his
will
for
your
life
is
a
will
for
his
life
friend
and
companion
now
please
do
not
take
one
of
these
words
and
say
i
like
that
and
another
and
say
that
conception
of
god
appeals
to
me
and
another
how
we
do
whittle
god
down
to
our
narrow
conceptions
you
must
take
all
five
words
and
think
the
finest
meaning
into
each
and
then
put
them
all
together
to
get
a
close
up
idea
of
god
he
is
all
that
you
see
god
is
so
much
that
it
takes
a
number
of
earth
relationships
put
together
to
get
a
good
suggestion
of
what
he
is
he
is
a
father
a
mother
a
friend
a
lover
a
husband
i
have
not
brought
book
and
chapter
and
verse
but
you
know
i
could
spend
a
long
time
with
you
reading
over
the
numerous
passages
giving
these
conceptions
of
god
and
god
will
for
us
is
the
plan
of
such
a
god
as
that
it
includes
the
body
health
and
strength
the
family
and
home
matters
money
and
business
matters
friendships
including
the
choice
of
life
chief
friend
it
includes
service
what
service
and
where
and
constant
guidance
it
includes
the
whole
life
and
the
world
of
lives
all
this
he
has
thought
into
lovingly
carefully
does
a
wise
mother
think
of
her
child
needs
into
the
details
the
necessities
and
the
loving
extras
that
is
god
u
the
one
purpose
of
now
the
whole
thought
in
prayer
is
to
get
the
will
of
a
god
like
that
done
in
our
lives
and
upon
this
old
earth
the
greatest
prayer
any
one
can
offer
is
thy
will
be
done
it
will
be
offered
in
a
thousand
different
forms
with
a
thousand
details
as
needs
arise
daily
but
every
true
prayer
comes
under
those
four
words
there
is
not
a
good
desirable
thing
that
you
have
thought
of
that
he
has
not
thought
of
first
and
probably
with
an
added
touch
not
in
your
thought
not
to
grit
your
teeth
and
lock
your
jaw
and
pray
for
grace
to
say
thy
will
be
it
is
bitter
but
i
must
be
resigned
that
is
a
christian
grace
thy
will
be
not
that
please
do
not
slander
god
like
that
there
is
a
superficial
idea
among
men
that
charges
god
with
many
misfortunes
and
ills
for
which
he
is
not
at
all
responsible
he
is
continually
doing
the
very
best
that
can
be
done
under
the
circumstances
for
the
best
results
he
has
a
bad
mixture
of
stubborn
warped
human
wills
to
deal
with
with
infinite
patience
and
skill
and
diplomacy
and
success
too
he
is
ever
working
at
the
tangled
skein
of
human
life
through
the
human
will
it
may
help
us
here
to
remember
that
god
has
a
first
and
a
second
will
for
us
a
first
choice
and
a
second
he
always
prefers
that
his
first
will
shall
be
accomplished
in
us
but
where
we
will
not
be
wooed
up
to
that
height
he
comes
down
to
the
highest
level
we
will
come
up
to
and
works
with
us
there
for
instance
god
first
choice
for
israel
was
that
he
himself
should
be
their
king
there
was
to
be
no
human
visible
king
as
with
the
surrounding
nations
he
was
to
be
their
king
they
were
to
be
peculiar
in
this
but
to
samuel
sorrow
and
yet
more
to
god
they
insisted
upon
a
king
and
so
god
gave
them
a
king
and
david
the
great
was
a
man
after
god
own
heart
and
the
saviour
came
of
the
davidic
line
god
did
his
best
upon
the
level
they
chose
and
a
great
best
it
was
yet
the
human
king
and
line
of
kings
was
not
god
first
will
but
a
second
will
yielded
to
because
the
first
would
not
be
accepted
god
is
ever
doing
the
best
for
human
lives
that
can
be
done
through
the
human
will
his
first
will
for
our
bodies
without
doubt
is
that
there
should
be
a
strong
healthy
body
for
each
of
us
but
there
is
a
far
higher
thing
being
aimed
at
in
us
than
that
and
with
keen
pain
to
his
own
heart
he
oft
times
permits
bodily
weakness
and
suffering
because
in
the
conditions
of
our
wills
only
so
can
these
higher
and
highest
things
be
gotten
at
and
where
the
human
will
comes
into
intelligent
touch
with
himself
and
the
higher
can
so
be
reached
with
great
gladness
and
eagerness
the
bodily
difficulty
is
removed
by
him
there
are
two
things
at
least
that
modify
god
first
will
for
us
first
of
all
the
degree
of
our
intelligent
willingness
that
he
shall
have
his
full
sway
and
second
the
circumstances
of
one
life
each
of
us
is
the
centre
of
a
circle
of
people
an
ever
changing
circle
if
we
be
in
touch
with
him
god
is
speaking
through
each
of
us
to
his
circle
our
experiences
with
god
his
dealings
with
us
under
the
varying
circumstances
are
a
part
of
his
message
to
that
circle
god
is
trying
to
win
men
it
takes
marvellous
diplomacy
on
his
part
and
god
is
a
wondrous
tactician
but
very
reverently
he
is
a
needy
god
he
needs
us
to
help
him
each
in
his
circle
we
must
be
perfectly
willing
to
have
his
will
done
and
more
we
must
trust
him
to
know
what
is
best
to
do
in
us
and
with
us
in
the
circle
of
our
circumstances
god
is
a
great
economist
he
wastes
no
forces
every
bit
is
being
conserved
towards
the
great
end
in
view
there
may
be
a
false
submission
to
his
supposed
will
in
some
affliction
a
not
reaching
out
after
that
he
has
for
us
and
at
the
other
swing
of
the
pendulum
there
may
be
a
sort
of
for
some
desirable
thing
because
a
friend
tells
us
we
should
claim
it
by
logical
praying
i
mean
the
studying
of
a
statement
of
god
word
and
possibly
some
explanation
of
it
and
hearing
or
knowing
how
somebody
else
has
claimed
a
certain
thing
through
that
statement
and
then
concluding
that
therefore
we
should
so
claim
the
trouble
with
that
is
that
it
stops
too
soon
praying
in
the
spirit
as
opposed
to
logical
praying
is
doing
this
logical
thinking
quietly
taking
all
to
god
to
learn
what
his
will
is
for
under
your
circumstances
and
in
the
circle
of
people
whom
he
touches
through
you
u
the
spirit
prayer
there
is
a
remarkable
passage
in
paul
roman
letter
about
prayer
and
god
will
and
in
like
manner
the
spirit
also
helpeth
our
infirmity
for
we
know
not
how
to
pray
as
we
ought
but
the
spirit
himself
maketh
intercession
for
us
with
groanings
which
can
not
be
uttered
and
he
that
searcheth
the
hearts
knoweth
what
is
the
mind
of
the
spirit
that
he
maketh
intercession
for
the
saints
according
to
the
will
of
god
please
notice
these
words
connect
back
with
the
verses
ending
with
verse
seventeen
verses
eighteen
to
are
a
parenthesis
as
the
spirit
within
breathes
out
the
father
cry
of
a
child
which
is
the
so
he
helps
us
in
praying
it
is
our
infirmity
that
we
do
not
know
how
to
pray
we
there
is
willingness
and
eagerness
too
no
bother
there
but
a
lack
of
knowledge
we
do
know
how
but
the
spirit
knows
how
he
is
the
he
knows
god
will
perfectly
he
knows
what
best
to
be
praying
under
all
circumstances
and
he
is
within
you
and
me
he
is
there
as
a
he
prompts
us
to
pray
he
calls
us
away
to
the
quiet
room
to
our
knees
he
inclines
to
prayer
wherever
we
are
he
is
thinking
thoughts
that
find
no
response
in
us
they
can
not
be
expressed
in
our
lips
for
they
are
not
in
our
thinking
he
prays
with
an
intensity
quite
beyond
the
possibility
of
language
to
express
and
the
god
listening
above
knows
fully
what
this
praying
spirit
is
thinking
within
me
and
wordlessly
praying
for
they
are
one
he
recognizes
his
own
purposes
and
plans
being
repeated
in
this
man
down
on
the
earth
by
his
own
spirit
and
the
great
truth
is
that
the
spirit
within
us
prays
god
will
he
teaches
us
god
will
he
teaches
us
how
to
pray
god
will
and
he
himself
prays
god
will
in
us
and
further
that
he
seeks
to
pray
will
that
is
to
pray
for
the
thing
god
has
planned
in
us
before
we
have
yet
reached
up
to
where
we
know
ourselves
what
that
will
is
we
should
be
ambitious
to
cultivate
a
healthy
sensitiveness
to
this
indwelling
spirit
and
when
there
comes
that
quick
inner
wooing
away
to
pray
let
us
faithfully
obey
even
though
we
be
not
clear
what
the
particular
petition
is
to
be
let
us
remain
in
prayer
while
he
uses
us
as
the
medium
of
his
praying
oftentimes
the
best
prayer
to
offer
about
some
friend
or
some
particular
thing
after
perhaps
stating
the
case
the
best
we
can
is
this
holy
spirit
be
praying
in
me
the
thing
the
father
wants
done
father
what
the
spirit
within
me
is
praying
that
is
my
prayer
in
jesus
name
thy
will
what
thou
art
wishing
and
thinking
may
that
be
fully
done
here
u
how
to
find
god
we
should
make
a
study
of
god
will
we
ought
to
seek
to
become
skilled
in
knowing
his
will
the
more
we
know
him
the
better
shall
we
be
able
to
read
intelligently
his
will
it
may
be
said
that
god
has
two
wills
for
each
of
us
or
better
there
are
two
parts
to
his
will
there
is
his
will
of
grace
and
his
will
of
government
his
will
of
grace
is
plainly
revealed
in
his
word
it
is
that
we
shall
be
saved
and
made
holy
and
pure
and
by
and
by
glorified
in
his
own
presence
his
will
of
government
is
his
particular
plan
for
my
life
god
has
every
life
planned
the
highest
possible
ambition
for
a
life
is
to
reach
god
plan
he
reveals
that
to
us
bit
by
bit
as
we
need
to
know
if
the
life
is
to
be
one
of
special
service
he
will
make
that
plain
what
service
and
where
and
when
then
each
next
step
he
will
make
plain
learning
his
will
here
hinges
upon
three
things
simple
enough
but
essential
i
must
keep
with
him
so
he
has
an
open
ear
to
talk
into
i
must
to
do
his
will
it
is
the
third
thing
needs
special
emphasis
many
who
are
right
on
the
first
two
stumble
here
and
sometimes
measure
their
length
on
the
ground
word
must
be
allowed
to
discipline
my
judgment
as
to
himself
and
his
many
of
us
stumble
on
number
one
and
on
number
two
and
very
many
willing
earnest
men
sprawl
badly
when
it
comes
to
number
three
the
bother
with
these
is
the
lack
of
a
disciplined
judgment
about
god
and
his
will
if
we
would
prayerfully
the
book
there
would
come
a
better
poised
judgment
we
need
to
get
a
broad
sweep
of
god
thought
to
breathe
him
in
as
he
reveals
himself
in
this
book
the
meek
man
that
is
the
man
willing
to
yield
his
will
to
a
higher
will
will
he
guide
in
his
judgment
that
is
in
his
mental
processes
this
is
john
standpoint
in
that
famous
passage
in
his
first
epistle
and
this
is
the
boldness
that
we
have
towards
him
that
if
we
ask
anything
according
to
his
will
he
heareth
us
and
if
we
know
that
he
heareth
us
whatsoever
we
ask
we
know
that
we
have
the
petitions
that
we
have
asked
of
him
these
words
dovetail
with
great
nicety
into
those
already
quoted
from
paul
in
the
eighth
of
romans
the
whole
supposition
here
is
that
we
have
learned
his
will
about
the
particular
matter
in
hand
having
gotten
that
footing
we
go
to
prayer
with
great
boldness
for
if
he
wants
a
thing
and
i
want
it
and
we
join
that
combination
can
not
be
broken
may
we
pray
with
assurance
for
the
conversion
of
our
loved
ones
u
god
door
into
a
the
heart
of
god
hungers
to
redeem
the
world
for
that
he
gave
his
own
only
son
though
the
treatment
he
received
tore
that
father
heart
to
the
bleeding
for
that
he
sent
the
holy
spirit
to
do
in
men
what
the
son
had
done
for
them
for
that
he
placed
in
human
hands
the
mightiest
of
all
forces
prayer
that
so
we
might
become
partners
with
him
for
that
too
he
set
man
in
the
relationships
of
kinship
and
friendship
he
wins
men
through
men
man
is
the
goal
and
he
is
also
the
road
to
the
goal
man
is
the
object
aimed
at
and
he
is
the
medium
of
approach
whether
the
advance
be
by
god
or
by
satan
god
will
not
enter
a
heart
without
his
consent
and
satan
god
would
reach
men
through
men
and
satan
must
and
so
god
has
set
us
in
the
strongest
relation
that
binds
men
the
relation
of
love
that
he
may
touch
one
through
another
kinship
is
a
relation
peculiar
to
man
and
to
the
earth
i
have
at
times
been
asked
by
some
earnest
sensitive
persons
if
it
is
not
selfish
to
be
especially
concerned
for
one
own
over
whom
the
heart
yearns
much
and
the
prayer
offered
is
more
tender
and
intense
and
more
frequent
well
if
do
not
pray
for
them
who
will
who
pray
for
them
with
such
believing
persistent
fervour
as
you
god
has
set
us
in
the
relationship
of
personal
affection
and
of
kinship
for
just
such
a
purpose
he
binds
us
together
with
the
ties
of
love
that
we
may
be
concerned
for
each
other
if
there
be
but
one
in
a
home
in
touch
with
god
that
one
becomes
god
door
into
the
whole
family
contact
means
opportunity
and
that
in
turn
means
responsibility
the
closer
the
contact
the
greater
the
opportunity
and
the
greater
too
the
responsibility
unselfishness
does
not
mean
to
exclude
one
self
and
one
own
it
means
right
proportions
in
our
perspective
humility
is
not
whipping
one
self
it
is
forgetting
one
self
in
the
thought
of
others
yet
even
that
may
be
carried
to
a
bad
extreme
not
only
is
it
not
selfish
so
to
pray
it
is
a
part
of
god
plan
that
we
should
so
pray
i
am
most
responsible
for
the
one
to
whom
i
am
most
closely
related
u
a
free
agent
one
of
the
questions
that
is
more
often
asked
in
this
connection
than
any
other
perhaps
is
this
may
we
pray
with
assurance
for
the
conversion
of
our
loved
ones
no
question
sets
more
hearts
in
an
audience
to
beating
faster
than
does
that
i
remember
speaking
in
the
boston
noonday
meeting
in
the
old
broomfield
street
church
on
this
subject
one
week
perhaps
i
was
speaking
rather
positively
and
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
one
day
a
keen
cultured
christian
woman
whom
i
knew
came
up
for
a
word
she
said
i
do
not
think
we
can
pray
like
that
and
i
said
why
not
she
paused
a
moment
and
her
agitation
revealed
in
eye
and
lip
told
me
how
deeply
her
thoughts
were
stirred
then
she
said
quietly
i
have
a
brother
he
is
not
a
christian
the
theatre
the
wine
the
club
the
cards
that
is
his
life
and
he
laughs
at
me
i
would
rather
than
anything
else
that
my
brother
were
a
christian
but
she
said
and
here
both
her
keenness
and
the
training
of
her
early
teaching
came
in
i
do
not
think
i
can
pray
positively
for
his
conversion
for
he
is
a
free
agent
is
he
not
and
god
will
not
save
a
man
against
his
will
i
want
to
say
to
you
what
i
said
to
her
man
a
free
agent
to
use
the
old
phrase
so
far
as
god
is
concerned
utterly
wholly
free
he
is
the
most
enslaved
agent
on
the
earth
so
far
as
sin
and
selfishness
and
prejudice
are
concerned
the
purpose
of
our
praying
is
not
to
force
or
coerce
his
will
never
that
it
is
to
his
will
of
the
warping
influences
that
now
twist
it
awry
it
is
to
get
the
dust
out
of
his
eyes
so
his
sight
shall
be
clear
and
once
he
is
free
able
to
see
aright
to
balance
things
without
prejudice
the
whole
probability
is
in
favour
of
his
using
his
will
to
choose
the
only
right
i
want
to
suggest
to
you
the
ideal
prayer
for
such
a
one
it
is
an
adaptation
of
jesus
own
words
it
may
be
pleaded
with
much
variety
of
detail
it
is
this
deliver
him
from
the
evil
one
and
work
in
him
for
him
by
thy
power
to
thy
glory
in
jesus
the
victor
name
and
there
are
three
special
passages
upon
which
to
base
this
prayer
first
timothy
second
chapter
fourth
verse
american
version
god
our
saviour
who
would
have
all
men
to
be
saved
that
is
god
will
for
your
loved
one
second
peter
third
chapter
ninth
verse
not
wishing
or
willing
that
any
should
perish
but
that
all
should
come
to
repentance
that
is
god
will
or
desire
for
the
one
you
are
thinking
of
now
the
third
passage
is
on
our
side
who
do
the
praying
it
tells
who
may
offer
this
prayer
with
assurance
john
fifteenth
chapter
seventh
verse
if
ye
abide
in
me
and
my
words
abide
in
you
you
ask
what
it
is
your
will
to
ask
and
i
will
bring
it
to
pass
for
you
there
is
a
statement
of
paul
in
second
timothy
that
graphically
pictures
this
the
lord
servant
must
not
strive
not
argue
nor
combat
but
be
gentle
towards
all
apt
to
teach
ready
and
skilled
in
explaining
helping
in
meekness
correcting
or
instructing
them
that
oppose
themselves
if
peradventure
god
may
give
them
repentance
unto
the
knowledge
of
the
truth
and
may
recover
themselves
out
of
the
snare
of
the
having
been
taken
captive
by
him
unto
his
will
that
word
deliver
in
this
prayer
as
used
by
jesus
the
word
under
our
english
has
a
picturesque
meaning
it
means
here
is
a
man
taken
captive
and
in
chains
but
he
has
become
infatuated
with
his
captor
and
is
befooled
regarding
his
condition
our
prayer
is
rescue
him
from
the
evil
one
and
because
jesus
is
victor
over
the
captor
the
rescue
will
take
place
without
any
doubt
we
may
assure
the
conversion
of
these
laid
upon
our
hearts
by
such
praying
the
prayer
in
jesus
name
drives
the
enemy
off
the
of
the
man
will
and
leaves
him
free
to
choose
aright
there
is
one
exception
to
be
noted
a
very
very
rare
exception
there
may
be
instances
where
such
a
prayer
may
not
be
offered
where
the
spirit
of
prayer
is
withdrawn
but
such
are
very
rare
and
extreme
and
the
conviction
regarding
that
will
be
unmistakable
beyond
asking
any
questions
and
i
can
not
resist
the
conviction
i
greatly
dislike
to
say
this
i
would
much
rather
not
if
i
regarded
either
my
own
feelings
or
yours
but
i
can
not
resist
the
conviction
listen
very
quietly
so
i
may
speak
in
quietest
tones
that
there
are
people
in
that
lower
lost
world
who
are
there
because
some
one
failed
to
put
his
life
in
touch
with
god
and
pray
u
the
place
where
god
is
having
said
that
much
let
me
go
on
to
say
this
further
and
please
let
me
say
it
all
in
softest
sobbing
voice
there
is
a
hell
there
must
be
a
hell
you
may
leave
this
bible
sheer
out
of
your
reckoning
in
the
matter
still
there
must
be
a
place
for
which
that
word
of
ugliest
associations
is
the
word
to
use
there
must
be
a
hell
that
is
the
name
for
the
place
where
god
is
not
for
the
place
where
they
will
gather
together
who
insist
on
leaving
god
out
god
out
there
can
be
no
worse
hell
than
that
god
away
man
held
back
by
no
restraints
i
am
very
clear
it
is
what
men
have
pictured
it
to
be
it
is
not
what
my
childish
fancy
saw
and
shrank
from
terrified
and
please
let
us
be
very
careful
that
we
never
consign
anybody
there
in
our
thinking
or
speaking
about
them
when
that
life
whose
future
might
be
questioned
has
gone
the
most
we
can
say
is
that
we
leave
it
with
a
god
infinitely
just
and
the
personification
of
love
there
has
been
in
some
quarters
an
unthinking
consigning
of
persons
to
a
lost
world
and
there
has
been
in
our
day
a
clean
swing
of
the
pendulum
to
the
other
extreme
both
drifts
are
to
be
dreaded
let
us
deal
very
tenderly
here
yet
with
a
right
plainness
in
our
tenderness
we
are
to
warn
men
faithfully
we
know
the
book
plain
teaching
that
these
who
prefer
to
leave
god
out
shall
go
away
the
going
is
of
their
own
accord
and
choice
regarding
particular
ones
we
do
not
know
and
are
best
silent
the
grave
is
closing
let
us
deal
with
the
living
one
day
at
the
close
of
the
morning
hour
at
a
bible
conference
in
the
alleghany
mountains
a
young
woman
came
up
for
a
moment
conversation
she
spoke
about
a
friend
not
a
professing
christian
for
whom
she
had
prayed
much
and
who
had
died
unexpectedly
he
had
passed
away
during
unconsciousness
with
no
opportunity
for
exchange
of
words
she
was
much
agitated
as
the
facts
were
recited
and
then
said
as
she
finished
he
is
lost
and
in
hell
and
i
can
never
pray
again
we
talked
quietly
awhile
and
i
gathered
the
following
facts
he
was
of
a
christian
family
perfectly
familiar
with
the
bible
was
a
thoughtful
man
of
outwardly
correct
life
in
the
main
had
talked
about
these
matters
with
others
but
had
never
either
in
conversation
or
more
openly
confessed
personal
faith
in
christ
he
was
not
in
good
health
then
came
the
sudden
end
one
other
fact
came
out
she
had
prayed
for
his
conversion
for
a
long
time
she
was
herself
an
earnest
christian
woman
solicitous
for
others
there
were
four
facts
to
go
upon
regarding
him
he
knew
the
way
to
god
he
was
thoughtful
he
had
never
openly
accepted
some
one
had
prayed
can
one
anything
certainly
about
that
man
condition
there
are
two
sorts
of
knowledge
direct
and
inferential
i
know
there
is
such
a
city
as
london
for
i
have
walked
its
streets
that
is
direct
knowledge
i
know
there
is
such
a
city
as
petersburg
because
though
i
have
never
been
there
yet
through
my
reading
pictures
i
have
seen
and
friends
who
have
been
there
i
am
clear
of
its
existence
to
the
point
of
that
is
inferential
knowledge
now
regarding
this
man
after
he
slipped
from
the
grasp
of
his
friends
i
have
no
direct
knowledge
but
i
have
very
positive
inferential
knowledge
based
upon
these
four
facts
three
of
the
facts
namely
the
first
second
and
fourth
were
favourable
to
the
end
desired
the
third
swings
neither
way
the
great
dominant
fact
in
the
case
is
the
fourth
and
a
great
and
dominating
fact
it
is
in
judging
some
one
in
touch
with
god
had
been
persistently
believingly
praying
up
to
the
time
of
the
quick
end
that
fact
with
the
others
gives
strong
inferential
knowledge
regarding
the
man
it
is
sufficient
to
comfort
a
heart
and
give
one
renewed
faith
in
praying
for
others
u
saving
the
we
can
not
know
a
man
mental
processes
this
is
surely
true
that
if
in
the
very
last
of
an
eye
a
man
look
up
towards
god
longingly
that
look
is
the
turning
of
the
will
to
god
and
that
is
quite
enough
god
is
eagerly
watching
with
hungry
eyes
for
the
quick
turn
of
a
human
eye
up
to
himself
doubtless
many
a
man
has
so
turned
in
the
last
moment
of
his
life
when
we
were
not
conscious
of
his
consciousness
nor
aware
of
the
movements
of
his
outwardly
unconscious
one
may
be
unconscious
of
outer
things
and
yet
be
keenly
conscious
towards
god
at
another
of
these
summer
gatherings
this
incident
came
to
me
a
man
seemingly
of
mature
mind
and
judgment
told
me
of
a
friend
of
his
that
was
as
close
as
i
got
to
the
friend
himself
this
friend
was
not
a
professing
christian
was
thrown
from
a
boat
sank
twice
and
perhaps
three
times
and
then
was
rescued
and
after
some
difficulty
resuscitated
he
told
afterwards
how
swiftly
his
thoughts
came
as
they
are
said
to
do
to
one
in
such
circumstances
he
thought
surely
he
was
drowning
was
quiet
in
his
mind
thought
of
god
and
how
he
had
not
been
trusting
him
and
in
his
thought
he
prayed
for
forgiveness
he
lived
afterwards
a
consistent
christian
life
this
illustrates
simply
the
possibilities
open
to
one
in
his
keen
inner
mental
processes
here
is
surely
enough
knowledge
to
comfort
many
a
bereft
heart
and
enough
too
to
make
us
pray
persistently
and
believingly
for
loved
ones
because
of
prayer
uncalculated
and
incalculable
power
be
sure
the
is
in
the
case
of
friend
in
yet
let
us
be
wary
very
wary
of
letting
this
influence
us
one
bit
farther
that
man
is
nothing
less
than
a
fool
who
presumes
upon
such
statements
to
resist
god
gracious
pleadings
for
his
life
and
on
our
side
we
must
not
fail
to
warn
men
lovingly
tenderly
yet
with
plainness
of
the
tremendous
danger
of
delay
in
coming
to
god
a
man
may
be
so
stupefied
at
the
close
as
to
shut
out
of
his
range
what
has
been
suggested
here
and
further
even
if
a
man
soul
be
saved
he
is
responsible
to
god
for
his
life
we
want
men
to
for
jesus
and
win
others
to
him
and
further
yet
reward
preferment
honour
in
god
kingdom
depends
upon
faithfulness
to
him
down
here
who
would
be
saved
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
the
great
fact
to
have
burned
in
deep
is
that
we
may
assure
the
coming
to
god
of
our
loved
ones
with
their
lives
as
well
as
for
their
souls
if
we
will
but
press
the
battle
u
giving
god
a
clear
road
for
out
in
one
of
the
states
i
ran
across
an
illustration
of
prayer
in
real
life
that
caught
me
at
once
and
has
greatly
helped
me
in
understanding
prayer
fact
is
more
fascinating
than
fiction
if
one
could
know
what
is
going
on
around
him
how
surprised
and
startled
he
would
be
if
we
could
get
the
facts
in
any
one
incident
and
get
them
colourlessly
and
have
the
judgment
to
sift
and
analyze
accurately
what
fascinating
instances
of
the
power
of
prayer
would
be
disclosed
there
is
a
double
side
to
this
story
the
side
of
the
man
who
was
changed
and
the
side
of
the
woman
who
prayed
he
is
a
new
englander
by
birth
and
breeding
now
living
in
this
western
state
almost
a
giant
physically
keen
mentally
a
lawyer
and
a
natural
leader
he
had
the
conviction
as
a
boy
that
if
he
became
a
christian
he
was
to
preach
but
he
grew
up
a
skeptic
read
up
and
lectured
on
skeptical
subjects
he
was
the
representative
of
a
district
of
his
western
home
state
in
congress
in
his
fourth
term
or
so
i
think
at
this
time
the
experience
i
am
telling
came
during
that
congress
when
the
controversy
was
up
the
intensest
congress
washington
has
known
since
the
civil
war
it
was
not
a
time
specially
suited
to
meditation
about
god
in
the
halls
of
congress
and
further
he
said
to
me
that
somehow
he
knew
all
the
other
skeptics
who
were
in
the
lower
house
and
they
drifted
together
a
good
bit
and
strengthened
each
other
by
their
talk
one
day
as
he
was
in
his
seat
in
the
lower
house
in
the
midst
of
the
business
of
the
hour
there
came
to
him
a
conviction
that
god
the
god
in
whom
he
did
not
believe
whose
existence
he
could
keenly
disprove
god
was
right
there
above
his
head
thinking
about
him
and
displeased
at
the
way
he
was
behaving
towards
him
and
he
said
to
himself
this
is
ridiculous
absurd
i
been
working
too
hard
confined
too
closely
my
mind
is
getting
morbid
i
go
out
and
get
some
fresh
air
and
shake
myself
and
so
he
did
but
the
conviction
only
deepened
and
intensified
day
by
day
it
grew
and
that
went
on
for
weeks
into
the
fourth
month
as
i
recall
his
words
then
he
planned
to
return
home
to
attend
to
some
business
matters
and
to
attend
to
some
preliminaries
for
securing
the
nomination
for
the
governorship
of
his
state
and
as
i
understand
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
securing
the
nomination
so
far
as
one
can
judge
of
such
matters
and
his
party
is
the
dominant
party
in
the
state
a
nomination
for
governor
by
his
party
has
usually
been
followed
by
election
he
reached
his
home
and
had
hardly
gotten
there
before
he
found
that
his
wife
and
two
others
had
entered
into
a
holy
compact
of
prayer
for
his
conversion
and
had
been
so
praying
for
some
months
instantly
he
thought
of
his
peculiar
unwelcome
washington
experience
and
became
intensely
interested
but
not
wishing
them
to
know
of
his
interest
he
asked
carelessly
when
this
thing
began
his
wife
told
him
the
day
he
did
some
quick
mental
figuring
and
he
said
to
me
i
knew
almost
instantly
that
the
day
she
named
fitted
into
the
calendar
with
the
coming
of
that
conviction
or
impression
about
god
presence
he
was
greatly
startled
he
wanted
to
be
thoroughly
honest
in
all
his
thinking
and
he
said
he
knew
that
if
a
single
fact
of
that
sort
could
be
established
of
prayer
producing
such
results
it
carried
the
whole
christian
scheme
of
belief
with
it
and
he
did
some
stiff
fighting
within
had
he
been
wrong
all
those
years
he
sifted
the
matter
back
and
forth
as
a
lawyer
would
the
evidence
in
any
case
and
he
said
to
me
as
an
honest
man
i
was
compelled
to
admit
the
facts
and
i
believe
i
might
have
been
led
to
christ
that
very
night
a
few
nights
later
he
knelt
at
the
altar
in
the
methodist
in
his
home
town
and
surrendered
his
strong
will
to
god
then
the
early
conviction
of
his
boyhood
days
came
back
he
was
to
preach
the
gospel
and
like
saul
of
old
he
utterly
changed
his
life
and
has
been
preaching
the
gospel
with
power
ever
since
then
i
was
intensely
fascinated
in
getting
the
other
side
the
of
the
story
his
wife
had
been
a
christian
for
years
since
before
their
marriage
but
in
some
meetings
in
the
home
church
she
was
led
into
a
new
a
full
surrender
to
jesus
christ
as
master
and
had
experienced
a
new
consciousness
of
the
holy
spirit
presence
and
power
almost
at
once
came
a
new
intense
desire
for
her
husband
conversion
the
compact
of
three
was
agreed
upon
of
daily
prayer
for
him
until
the
change
came
as
she
prayed
that
night
after
retiring
to
her
sleeping
apartment
she
was
in
great
distress
of
mind
in
thinking
and
praying
for
him
she
could
get
no
rest
from
this
intense
distress
at
length
she
rose
and
knelt
by
the
bedside
to
pray
as
she
was
praying
and
distressed
a
voice
an
exquisitely
quiet
inner
voice
said
will
you
abide
the
consequences
she
was
startled
such
a
thing
was
wholly
new
to
her
she
did
not
know
what
it
meant
and
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
went
on
praying
again
came
the
same
quietly
spoken
words
to
her
ear
will
you
abide
the
consequences
and
again
the
half
frightened
feeling
she
slipped
back
to
bed
to
sleep
but
sleep
did
not
come
and
back
again
to
her
knees
and
again
the
patient
quiet
voice
this
time
with
an
earnestness
bearing
the
impress
of
her
agony
she
said
lord
i
will
abide
any
consequence
that
may
come
if
only
my
husband
may
be
brought
to
thee
and
at
once
the
distress
slipped
away
and
a
new
sweet
peace
filled
her
being
and
sleep
quickly
came
and
while
she
prayed
on
for
weeks
and
months
patiently
persistently
day
by
day
the
distress
was
gone
the
sweet
peace
remained
in
the
assurance
that
the
result
was
surely
coming
and
so
it
was
coming
all
those
days
down
in
the
thick
air
of
washington
lower
house
and
so
it
did
come
what
the
consequence
to
her
she
was
a
congressman
wife
she
would
likely
have
been
so
far
as
such
matters
may
be
judged
the
wife
of
the
governor
of
her
state
the
first
lady
socially
of
the
state
she
is
a
methodist
minister
wife
changing
her
home
every
few
years
a
very
different
position
in
many
ways
no
woman
will
be
indifferent
to
the
social
difference
involved
yet
rarely
have
i
met
a
woman
with
more
of
that
fine
beauty
which
the
peace
of
god
brings
in
her
glad
face
and
in
her
winsome
smile
do
you
see
the
simple
philosophy
of
that
experience
her
surrender
gave
god
a
clear
channel
into
that
man
will
when
the
roadway
was
cleared
her
prayer
was
a
traversing
instantly
the
hundreds
of
intervening
miles
and
affecting
the
of
his
presence
shall
we
not
put
our
wills
fully
in
touch
with
god
and
sheer
out
of
sympathy
with
the
other
one
and
persistently
plead
and
claim
for
each
loved
one
deliver
him
from
the
evil
one
and
work
in
him
thy
will
to
thy
glory
by
thy
power
in
the
victor
name
and
then
add
amen
so
it
be
not
so
it
be
a
wish
but
so
it
be
an
expression
of
confidence
in
jesus
power
these
lives
shall
be
won
and
these
souls
iv
jesus
habits
of
prayer
a
pen
sketch
dissolving
views
deepening
shadows
under
the
olive
trees
a
composite
picture
jesus
habits
of
prayer
u
a
pen
when
god
would
win
back
his
prodigal
world
he
sent
down
a
man
that
man
while
more
than
man
insisted
upon
being
truly
a
man
he
touched
human
life
at
every
point
no
man
seems
to
have
understood
prayer
and
to
have
prayed
as
did
he
how
can
we
better
conclude
these
quiet
talks
on
prayer
than
by
gathering
about
his
person
and
studying
his
habits
of
prayer
a
habit
is
an
act
repeated
so
often
as
to
be
done
involuntarily
that
is
without
a
new
decision
of
the
mind
each
time
it
is
done
jesus
prayed
he
loved
to
pray
sometimes
praying
was
his
way
of
resting
he
prayed
so
much
and
so
often
that
it
became
a
part
of
his
life
it
became
to
him
like
breathing
involuntary
there
is
no
thing
we
need
so
much
as
to
learn
how
to
pray
there
are
two
ways
of
receiving
instruction
one
by
being
told
the
other
by
watching
some
one
else
the
latter
is
the
simpler
and
the
surer
way
how
better
can
we
learn
how
to
pray
than
by
watching
how
jesus
prayed
and
then
trying
to
imitate
him
not
just
now
studying
what
he
about
prayer
invaluable
as
that
is
and
so
closely
interwoven
with
the
other
nor
yet
how
he
received
the
requests
of
men
when
on
earth
full
of
inspiring
suggestion
as
that
is
of
his
attitude
towards
our
prayers
but
how
he
himself
prayed
when
down
here
surrounded
by
our
same
circumstances
and
temptations
there
are
two
sections
of
the
bible
to
which
we
at
once
turn
for
light
the
gospels
and
the
psalms
in
the
gospels
is
given
chiefly
the
side
of
his
and
in
certain
of
the
psalms
glimpses
of
the
side
are
unmistakably
revealed
turning
now
to
the
gospels
we
find
the
picture
of
the
praying
jesus
like
an
etching
a
sketch
in
black
and
white
the
fewest
possible
strokes
of
the
pen
a
scratch
here
a
line
there
frequently
a
single
word
added
by
one
writer
to
the
narrative
of
the
others
which
gradually
bring
to
view
the
outline
of
a
lone
figure
with
upturned
face
of
the
fifteen
mentions
of
his
praying
found
in
the
four
gospels
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
while
matthew
gives
three
and
mark
and
john
each
four
it
is
luke
paul
companion
and
friend
who
in
eleven
such
allusions
supplies
most
of
the
picture
does
this
not
contain
a
strong
hint
of
the
explanation
of
that
other
etching
plainly
traceable
in
the
epistles
which
reveals
paul
own
marvellous
matthew
immersed
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
writes
to
the
jews
of
their
promised
davidic
king
mark
with
rapid
pen
relates
the
ceaseless
activity
of
this
wonderful
servant
of
the
father
john
with
imprisoned
body
but
rare
liberty
of
vision
from
the
revealed
on
patmos
depicts
the
son
of
god
coming
on
an
errand
from
the
father
into
the
world
and
again
leaving
the
world
and
going
back
home
unto
the
father
but
luke
emphasizes
the
jesus
a
with
reverence
let
me
use
a
word
in
its
meaning
a
that
is
one
of
ourselves
and
the
holy
spirit
makes
it
very
plain
throughout
luke
narrative
that
the
christ
jesus
prayed
to
pray
to
pray
oh
when
shall
we
men
down
here
sent
into
the
world
as
he
was
sent
into
the
world
with
the
same
mission
the
same
field
the
same
satan
to
combat
the
same
holy
spirit
to
empower
find
out
that
power
lies
in
keeping
closest
connection
with
the
sender
and
completest
insulation
from
the
world
u
dissolving
let
me
rapidily
sketch
those
fifteen
mentions
of
the
gospel
writers
attempting
to
keep
their
chronological
order
first
is
by
luke
in
chapter
three
the
first
three
gospels
all
tell
of
jesus
double
baptism
but
it
is
luke
who
adds
and
praying
it
was
while
waiting
in
prayer
that
he
received
the
gift
of
the
holy
spirit
he
not
begin
his
public
mission
without
that
anointing
it
had
been
promised
in
the
prophetic
writings
and
now
standing
in
the
jordan
he
waits
and
prays
until
the
blue
above
is
burst
through
by
the
gleams
of
from
the
and
the
spirit
wings
down
and
abides
upon
him
brings
prayer
power
the
time
of
prayer
is
the
time
of
power
the
place
of
prayer
is
the
place
of
power
prayer
is
tightening
the
connections
with
the
divine
dynamo
so
that
the
power
may
flow
freely
without
loss
or
interruption
second
is
made
by
mark
in
chapter
one
luke
in
chapter
four
hints
at
it
when
it
was
day
he
came
out
and
went
into
a
desert
place
but
mark
tells
us
plainly
in
the
morning
a
great
while
before
the
day
or
a
little
more
literally
early
while
it
was
yet
very
dark
he
arose
and
went
out
into
the
desert
or
solitary
place
and
there
prayed
the
day
before
a
sabbath
day
spent
in
his
adopted
capernaum
had
been
a
very
busy
day
for
him
teaching
in
the
synagogue
service
the
interruption
by
a
man
the
casting
out
amid
a
painful
scene
afterwards
the
healing
of
peter
and
then
at
the
great
crowd
of
diseased
and
demonized
thronging
the
narrow
street
until
far
into
the
night
while
he
passing
amongst
them
by
personal
touch
healed
and
restored
every
one
it
was
a
long
and
exhausting
day
work
one
of
us
spending
as
busy
a
sabbath
would
probably
feel
that
the
next
morning
needed
an
extra
hour
sleep
if
possible
one
must
rest
surely
but
this
man
jesus
seemed
to
have
another
way
of
resting
in
addition
to
sleep
probably
he
occupied
the
in
home
the
house
was
likely
astir
at
the
usual
hour
and
by
and
by
breakfast
was
ready
but
the
master
had
not
appeared
yet
so
they
waited
a
bit
after
a
while
the
maid
slips
to
his
room
door
and
taps
lightly
but
there
no
answer
again
a
little
bolder
knock
then
pushing
the
door
ajar
she
finds
the
room
unoccupied
where
the
master
ah
peter
says
i
think
i
know
i
have
noticed
before
this
that
he
has
a
way
of
slipping
off
early
in
the
morning
to
some
quiet
place
where
he
can
be
alone
and
a
little
knot
of
disciples
with
peter
in
the
lead
starts
out
on
a
search
for
him
for
already
a
crowd
is
gathering
at
the
door
and
filling
the
street
again
hungry
for
more
and
they
tracked
him
down
here
and
there
on
the
hillsides
among
clumps
of
trees
until
suddenly
they
come
upon
him
quietly
praying
with
a
wondrous
calm
in
his
great
eyes
listen
to
peter
as
he
eagerly
blurts
out
master
there
a
big
crowd
down
there
all
asking
for
you
but
the
master
quiet
decisive
tones
reply
let
us
go
into
the
next
towns
that
i
may
preach
there
also
for
to
this
end
came
i
forth
much
easier
to
go
back
and
deal
again
with
the
old
crowd
of
yesterday
harder
to
meet
the
new
crowds
with
their
new
skepticism
but
there
no
doubt
about
what
be
done
prayer
wonderfully
clears
the
vision
steadies
the
nerves
defines
duty
stiffens
the
purpose
sweetens
and
strengthens
the
spirit
the
busier
the
day
for
him
the
more
surely
must
the
morning
appointment
be
kept
and
even
an
earlier
start
made
apparently
the
more
virtue
went
forth
from
him
the
more
certainly
must
he
spend
time
and
even
time
alone
with
him
who
is
the
source
of
power
third
is
in
luke
chapter
five
not
a
great
while
after
the
scene
just
described
possibly
while
on
the
trip
suggested
by
his
answer
to
peter
in
some
one
of
the
numerous
galilean
villages
moved
with
the
compassion
that
ever
burned
his
heart
he
had
healed
a
badly
diseased
leper
who
disregarding
his
express
command
so
widely
published
the
fact
of
his
remarkable
healing
that
great
crowds
blocked
jesus
way
in
the
village
and
compelled
him
to
go
out
to
the
country
district
where
the
crowds
which
the
village
could
not
hold
now
throng
about
him
now
note
what
the
master
does
the
authorized
version
says
he
withdrew
into
the
wilderness
and
prayed
a
more
nearly
literal
reading
would
be
he
was
retiring
in
the
deserts
and
praying
suggesting
not
a
single
act
but
rather
habit
of
running
through
several
days
or
even
weeks
that
is
being
compelled
by
the
greatness
of
the
crowds
to
go
into
the
deserts
or
country
districts
and
being
constantly
thronged
there
by
the
people
he
had
to
get
alone
and
yet
more
need
and
so
while
he
patiently
continues
his
work
among
them
he
studiously
seeks
opportunity
to
retire
at
intervals
from
the
crowds
to
pray
how
much
his
life
was
like
ours
pressed
by
duties
by
opportunities
for
service
by
the
great
need
around
us
we
are
strongly
tempted
to
give
less
time
to
the
inner
chamber
with
door
shut
surely
this
work
must
be
done
we
think
though
it
does
crowd
and
flurry
our
prayer
time
some
the
master
practice
here
says
with
intense
emphasis
not
work
first
and
prayer
to
bless
it
but
the
place
given
to
prayer
and
then
the
service
growing
out
of
such
prayer
will
be
charged
with
unmeasured
power
the
greater
the
outer
pressure
on
his
the
more
jealously
he
guarded
against
either
a
shortening
of
its
time
or
a
flurrying
of
its
spirit
the
tighter
the
tension
the
more
time
must
there
be
for
unhurried
prayer
fourth
is
found
in
luke
chapter
six
it
came
to
pass
in
these
days
that
he
went
out
into
the
mountains
to
pray
and
he
continued
all
night
in
prayer
to
god
the
time
is
probably
about
the
middle
of
the
second
year
of
his
public
ministry
he
had
been
having
very
exasperating
experiences
with
the
national
leaders
from
judea
who
dogged
his
steps
criticising
and
nagging
at
every
turn
sowing
seeds
of
skepticism
among
his
galileans
it
was
also
the
day
he
selected
the
twelve
men
who
were
to
be
the
leaders
after
his
departure
and
preached
the
mountain
sermon
luke
does
not
say
that
he
to
spend
the
entire
night
in
prayer
wearied
in
spirit
by
the
ceaseless
petty
picking
and
satanic
hatred
of
his
enemies
thinking
of
the
serious
work
of
the
morrow
there
was
just
one
thing
for
him
to
do
he
knew
where
to
find
rest
and
sweet
fellowship
and
a
calming
presence
and
wise
counsel
turning
his
face
northward
he
sought
the
solitude
of
the
mountain
not
far
off
for
quiet
meditation
and
prayer
and
as
he
prayed
and
listened
and
talked
without
words
daylight
gradually
grew
into
twilight
and
that
yielded
imperceptibly
to
the
brilliant
oriental
stars
spraying
down
their
lustrous
and
still
he
prayed
while
the
darkness
below
and
the
blue
above
deepened
and
the
stilling
calm
of
god
wrapped
all
nature
around
and
hushed
his
heart
into
a
deeper
peace
in
the
fascination
of
the
father
loving
presence
he
was
utterly
lost
to
the
flight
of
time
but
prayed
on
and
on
until
by
and
by
the
earth
had
once
more
completed
its
daily
turn
the
gray
streaks
of
dawnlight
crept
up
the
east
and
the
face
of
palestine
fragrant
with
the
deep
dews
of
an
eastern
night
was
kissed
by
a
sun
of
a
new
day
and
then
when
it
was
day
how
quietly
the
narrative
goes
on
he
called
the
disciples
and
from
them
twelve
and
a
great
multitude
of
disciples
and
of
the
people
came
and
he
all
and
he
opened
his
mouth
and
them
power
came
forth
from
him
is
it
any
wonder
after
such
a
night
if
all
our
exasperations
and
embarrassments
were
followed
and
all
our
decisions
and
utterances
preceded
by
unhurried
prayer
what
power
would
come
forth
from
us
too
because
as
he
is
even
so
are
we
in
this
world
fifth
is
made
by
matthew
chapter
fourteen
and
mark
chapter
six
john
hinting
at
it
in
chapter
six
of
his
gospel
it
was
about
the
time
of
the
third
passover
the
beginning
of
his
last
year
of
service
both
he
and
the
disciples
had
been
kept
exceedingly
busy
with
the
great
throng
coming
and
going
incessantly
the
startling
news
had
just
come
of
the
tragic
death
of
his
forerunner
there
was
need
of
bodily
rest
as
well
as
of
quiet
to
think
over
the
rapidly
culminating
opposition
so
taking
boat
they
headed
towards
the
eastern
shore
of
the
lake
but
the
eager
crowds
watched
the
direction
taken
and
spreading
the
news
literally
ran
around
the
head
of
the
lake
and
them
and
when
he
stepped
from
the
boat
for
the
rest
there
was
an
immense
company
numbering
thousands
waiting
for
him
did
some
feeling
of
impatience
break
out
among
the
disciples
that
they
could
not
be
allowed
a
little
leisure
very
likely
for
they
were
so
much
like
us
but
was
moved
with
compassion
and
wearied
though
he
was
patiently
spent
the
entire
day
in
teaching
and
then
at
eventime
when
the
disciples
proposed
sending
them
away
for
food
he
with
a
handful
of
loaves
and
fishes
satisfied
the
bodily
cravings
of
as
many
as
five
thousand
there
is
nothing
that
has
so
appealed
to
the
masses
in
all
countries
and
all
centuries
as
ability
to
furnish
plenty
to
eat
literally
tens
of
thousands
of
the
human
race
fall
asleep
every
night
hungry
so
here
at
once
it
is
proposed
by
a
great
popular
uprising
under
the
leadership
of
this
wonderful
man
as
king
to
throw
off
the
oppressive
roman
yoke
certainly
if
only
his
consent
could
be
had
it
would
be
immensely
successful
they
thought
does
this
not
rank
with
satan
suggestion
in
the
wilderness
and
with
the
later
possibility
coming
through
the
visit
of
the
greek
deputation
of
establishing
the
kingdom
without
suffering
it
was
a
temptation
even
though
it
found
no
response
within
him
with
the
power
of
his
presence
so
markedly
felt
at
times
he
quieted
the
movement
constrained
the
disciples
to
go
by
boat
before
him
to
the
other
side
while
he
dismissed
the
throng
and
after
he
had
leave
of
what
gentle
courtesy
and
tenderness
mingled
with
his
irrevocable
decision
he
went
up
in
the
mountain
and
in
until
the
morning
watch
a
second
night
spent
in
prayer
bodily
weary
his
spirit
startled
by
an
event
which
vividly
foreshadowed
his
own
approaching
violent
death
and
now
this
vigorous
renewal
of
his
old
temptation
again
he
had
recourse
to
his
one
unfailing
habit
of
getting
off
alone
time
alone
pray
time
to
pray
was
his
one
invariable
offset
to
all
difficulties
all
temptations
and
all
needs
how
much
more
there
must
have
been
in
prayer
as
he
understood
and
practiced
it
than
many
of
his
disciples
know
u
deepening
we
shall
perhaps
understand
better
some
of
the
remaining
prayer
incidents
if
we
remember
that
jesus
is
now
in
the
last
year
of
his
ministry
the
acute
state
of
his
experiences
with
the
national
leaders
preceding
the
final
break
the
awful
shadow
of
the
cross
grows
deeper
and
darker
across
his
path
the
hatred
of
the
opposition
leader
gets
constantly
intenser
the
conditions
of
discipleship
are
more
sharply
put
the
inability
of
the
crowds
of
the
disciples
and
others
to
understand
him
grows
more
marked
many
followers
go
back
he
seeks
to
get
more
time
for
intercourse
with
the
twelve
he
makes
frequent
trips
to
distant
points
on
the
border
of
the
outside
world
the
coming
scenes
and
experiences
scene
on
the
little
hillock
outside
the
jerusalem
wall
seem
never
absent
from
his
thoughts
sixth
is
made
by
luke
chapter
nine
they
are
up
north
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
roman
city
of
cæsarea
philippi
and
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
praying
alone
the
disciples
were
with
him
alone
so
far
as
the
multitudes
are
concerned
but
seeming
to
be
drawing
these
twelve
nearer
to
his
inner
life
some
of
these
later
incidents
seem
to
suggest
that
he
was
trying
to
woo
them
into
something
of
the
same
love
for
the
fascination
of
secret
prayer
that
he
had
how
much
they
would
need
to
pray
in
the
coming
years
when
he
was
gone
possibly
too
he
yearned
for
a
closer
fellowship
with
them
he
loved
human
fellowship
as
peter
and
james
and
john
and
mary
and
martha
and
many
other
gentle
women
well
knew
and
there
is
no
fellowship
among
men
to
be
compared
with
fellowship
there
is
a
place
where
where
holds
fellowship
with
a
place
than
all
beside
more
sweet
it
is
the
seventh
is
in
this
same
ninth
chapter
of
luke
and
records
a
third
night
of
prayer
matthew
and
mark
also
tell
of
the
transfiguration
scene
but
it
is
luke
who
explains
that
he
went
up
into
the
mountain
and
that
it
was
he
was
that
the
fashion
of
his
countenance
was
altered
without
stopping
to
study
the
purpose
of
this
marvellous
manifestation
of
his
divine
glory
to
the
chosen
three
at
a
time
when
desertion
and
hatred
were
so
marked
it
is
enough
now
to
note
the
significant
fact
that
it
was
while
was
that
the
wondrous
change
came
while
praying
and
by
his
side
stood
one
who
centuries
before
on
the
earth
had
spent
so
much
time
alone
with
god
that
the
of
that
presence
transfigured
face
though
he
was
unconscious
of
it
a
shining
face
caused
by
contact
with
god
shall
not
we
to
whom
the
master
has
said
follow
me
get
alone
with
him
and
his
blessed
word
so
habitually
with
open
or
uncovered
face
that
is
with
eyesight
unhindered
by
prejudice
or
that
mirroring
the
glory
of
his
face
we
shall
more
and
more
come
to
bear
his
very
likeness
upon
our
faces
and
the
face
shines
bright
with
a
glow
of
light
from
his
presence
sent
whom
she
loves
to
meet
yes
the
face
beams
bright
with
an
inner
light
as
by
day
so
by
night
in
shade
as
in
shine
with
a
beauty
fine
that
she
wist
not
of
from
some
source
within
and
above
still
the
face
shines
bright
with
the
from
the
mountain
height
where
the
resplendent
sight
of
his
face
fills
her
view
and
illumines
in
turn
first
the
few
then
the
wide
race
eighth
is
in
the
tenth
chapter
of
luke
he
had
organized
a
band
of
men
sending
them
out
in
two
into
the
places
he
expected
to
visit
they
had
returned
with
a
joyful
report
of
the
power
attending
their
work
and
standing
in
their
midst
his
own
heart
overflowing
with
joy
he
looked
up
and
as
though
the
father
face
was
visible
spake
out
to
him
the
gladness
of
his
heart
he
seemed
to
be
always
conscious
of
his
father
presence
and
the
most
natural
thing
was
to
speak
to
him
they
were
always
within
speaking
distance
of
each
other
and
always
on
speaking
terms
ninth
is
in
the
eleventh
chapter
of
luke
very
similar
to
the
sixth
mention
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
praying
in
a
certain
place
that
when
he
ceased
one
of
his
disciples
said
unto
him
teach
us
to
pray
without
doubt
these
disciples
were
praying
men
he
had
already
talked
to
them
a
great
deal
about
prayer
but
as
they
noticed
how
large
a
place
prayer
had
in
his
life
and
some
of
the
marvellous
results
the
fact
came
home
to
them
with
great
force
that
there
must
be
some
fascination
some
power
some
secret
in
prayer
of
which
were
this
man
was
a
master
in
the
fine
art
of
prayer
really
did
not
know
how
to
pray
they
thought
how
their
request
must
have
delighted
him
at
last
they
were
being
aroused
concerning
great
secret
of
power
may
it
be
that
this
simple
recital
of
his
habits
of
prayer
may
move
every
one
of
us
to
get
alone
with
him
and
make
the
same
earnest
request
for
the
first
step
in
to
pray
is
to
pray
lord
teach
me
to
pray
and
who
teach
like
him
tenth
is
found
in
john
chapter
eleven
and
is
the
second
of
the
four
instances
of
ejaculatory
prayer
a
large
company
is
gathered
outside
the
village
of
bethany
around
a
tomb
in
which
four
days
before
the
body
of
a
young
man
had
been
laid
away
there
is
mary
still
weeping
and
martha
always
keenly
alive
to
the
proprieties
trying
to
be
more
composed
and
their
personal
friends
and
the
villagers
and
the
company
of
acquaintances
and
others
from
jerusalem
at
his
word
after
some
hesitation
the
stone
at
the
mouth
of
the
tomb
is
rolled
aside
and
jesus
lifted
up
his
eyes
and
said
father
i
thank
thee
that
thou
heardest
me
and
i
knew
that
thou
hearest
me
always
but
because
of
the
multitude
that
standeth
around
i
said
it
that
they
may
believe
that
thou
didst
send
me
clearly
before
coming
to
the
tomb
he
had
been
praying
in
secret
about
the
raising
of
lazarus
and
what
followed
was
in
answer
to
his
prayer
how
plain
it
becomes
that
all
the
marvellous
power
displayed
in
his
brief
earthly
career
through
what
inseparable
intimacy
between
his
life
of
activity
at
which
the
multitude
then
and
ever
since
has
marvelled
and
his
hidden
of
which
only
these
passing
glimpses
are
obtained
surely
the
greatest
power
entrusted
to
man
is
but
how
many
of
us
are
untrue
to
the
trust
while
this
strangely
omnipotent
power
put
into
our
hands
lies
so
largely
unused
note
also
the
certainty
of
his
faith
in
the
hearer
of
prayer
i
thank
thee
that
thou
heardest
me
there
was
nothing
that
could
be
to
warrant
such
faith
there
lay
the
dead
body
but
he
trusted
as
him
who
is
faith
is
blind
except
upward
it
is
blind
to
impossibilities
and
deaf
to
doubt
it
listens
only
to
god
and
sees
only
his
power
and
acts
accordingly
faith
is
not
believing
that
he
but
that
he
but
such
faith
comes
only
of
close
continuous
contact
with
god
its
birthplace
is
in
the
secret
closet
and
time
and
the
open
word
and
an
awakened
ear
and
a
reverent
quiet
heart
are
necessary
to
its
growth
eleventh
is
found
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
john
two
or
three
days
before
the
fated
friday
some
greek
visitors
to
the
jewish
feast
of
passover
sought
an
interview
with
him
the
request
seemed
to
bring
to
his
mind
a
vision
of
the
great
outside
world
after
which
his
heart
yearned
coming
to
him
so
hungry
for
what
only
he
could
give
and
instantly
athwart
that
vision
like
an
shadow
came
the
other
vision
never
absent
now
from
his
waking
thoughts
the
so
awfully
near
shrinking
in
horror
from
the
second
vision
yet
knowing
that
only
through
its
realization
could
be
realized
the
first
seemingly
forgetful
for
the
moment
of
the
as
though
soliloquizing
he
speaks
now
is
my
soul
troubled
and
what
shall
i
say
shall
i
say
father
me
from
this
hour
but
for
this
cause
came
i
unto
this
hour
is
what
i
will
say
and
the
intense
conflict
of
soul
merges
into
the
complete
victory
of
a
wholly
surrendered
will
glorify
thy
quick
as
the
prayer
was
uttered
came
the
audible
voice
out
of
heaven
answering
i
have
both
glorified
it
and
will
glorify
it
again
how
near
heaven
must
be
how
quickly
the
father
hears
he
must
be
bending
over
intently
listening
eager
to
catch
even
faintly
whispered
prayer
their
ears
full
of
unaccustomed
to
listening
to
a
heavenly
voice
could
hear
nothing
intelligible
he
had
a
isaiah
revised
a
passage
plainly
prophetic
of
him
suggests
how
it
was
that
he
could
understand
this
voice
so
easily
and
quickly
he
wakeneth
morning
by
morning
he
wakeneth
mine
ear
to
hear
as
they
that
are
taught
a
taught
ear
is
as
necessary
to
prayer
as
a
taught
tongue
and
the
daily
morning
appointment
with
god
seems
essential
to
both
u
under
the
olive
twelfth
is
made
by
luke
chapter
it
is
thursday
night
of
passion
week
in
the
large
upper
room
in
jerusalem
where
he
is
celebrating
the
old
passover
feast
and
initiating
the
new
memorial
feast
but
even
that
hallowed
hour
is
disturbed
by
the
disciples
disputes
with
the
great
patience
of
great
love
he
gives
them
the
wonderful
example
of
humility
of
which
john
thirteen
tells
speaking
gently
of
what
it
meant
and
then
turning
to
peter
and
using
his
old
name
he
says
simon
simon
behold
satan
asked
to
have
you
that
he
might
sift
you
as
wheat
but
i
made
supplication
for
thee
that
thy
faith
fail
not
had
been
praying
for
peter
by
name
that
was
one
of
his
praying
for
others
and
he
has
not
broken
off
that
blessed
habit
yet
he
is
able
to
save
to
the
uttermost
them
that
draw
near
to
god
through
him
he
ever
liveth
to
make
intercession
for
his
occupation
now
seated
at
his
father
right
hand
in
glory
is
for
each
of
who
trust
him
by
name
why
not
thirteenth
is
the
familiar
one
in
john
chapter
seventeen
and
can
not
be
studied
within
these
narrow
limits
but
merely
fitted
into
us
order
the
twelfth
chapter
contains
his
last
words
to
the
world
in
the
thirteenth
and
through
to
the
close
of
this
seventeenth
he
is
alone
with
his
disciples
if
this
prayer
is
read
carefully
in
the
revised
version
it
will
be
seen
that
its
standpoint
is
that
of
one
who
thinks
of
his
work
down
in
the
world
as
already
done
though
the
chief
scene
is
yet
to
come
and
the
world
left
behind
and
now
he
is
about
his
presence
to
be
in
glory
there
it
is
really
therefore
a
sort
of
specimen
of
the
praying
for
us
in
which
he
is
engaged
and
so
is
commonly
called
the
intercessory
or
prayer
for
thirty
years
he
lived
a
perfect
life
for
three
and
a
half
years
he
was
a
prophet
speaking
to
men
for
god
for
nineteen
centuries
he
has
been
high
priest
speaking
to
god
for
men
when
he
returns
it
will
be
as
king
to
reign
over
men
for
god
fourteenth
brings
us
within
the
sadly
sacred
precincts
of
gethsemane
garden
one
of
his
favourite
where
he
frequently
went
while
in
jerusalem
the
record
is
found
in
matthew
mark
fourteen
and
luke
let
us
approach
with
hearts
hushed
and
heads
bared
and
bowed
for
this
is
indeed
hallowed
ground
it
is
a
little
later
on
that
same
thursday
night
into
which
so
much
has
already
been
pressed
and
so
much
more
is
yet
to
come
after
the
talk
in
the
upper
room
and
the
simple
wondrous
prayer
he
leads
the
little
band
out
of
the
city
gate
on
the
east
across
the
swift
muddy
kidron
into
the
inclosed
grove
of
olive
trees
beyond
there
would
be
no
sleep
for
him
that
night
within
an
hour
or
two
the
roman
soldiers
and
the
jewish
mob
led
by
the
traitor
will
be
there
searching
for
him
and
he
meant
to
spend
the
intervening
time
in
with
the
longing
for
sympathy
so
marked
during
these
latter
months
he
takes
peter
and
james
and
john
and
goes
farther
into
the
grove
but
now
some
invisible
power
tears
him
away
and
plunges
him
alone
still
farther
into
the
moonlit
recesses
of
the
garden
and
there
a
strange
awful
struggle
of
soul
ensues
it
seems
like
a
renewal
of
the
same
conflict
he
experienced
in
john
twelve
when
the
greeks
came
but
immeasurably
intenser
he
who
in
himself
knew
no
sin
was
now
beginning
to
realize
in
his
spirit
what
within
a
few
hours
he
realized
that
he
was
in
very
deed
to
be
made
sin
for
us
and
the
awful
realization
comes
in
upon
him
with
such
terrific
intensity
that
it
seems
as
though
his
physical
frame
can
not
endure
the
strain
of
mental
agony
the
experience
of
the
next
day
produced
such
mental
agony
that
his
physical
strength
gave
way
for
he
died
not
of
his
physical
suffering
excruciating
as
that
was
but
literally
of
a
broken
heart
its
walls
burst
asunder
by
the
strain
of
soul
it
is
not
possible
for
a
sinning
soul
to
appreciate
with
what
nightmare
dread
and
horror
the
sinless
soul
of
jesus
must
have
approached
the
coming
contact
with
the
sin
of
a
world
with
bated
breath
and
reverent
gaze
one
follows
that
lonely
figure
among
the
trees
now
kneeling
now
falling
upon
his
face
lying
prostrate
he
prayed
that
it
were
possible
the
hour
might
pass
away
from
him
one
snatch
of
that
prayer
reaches
our
ears
abba
father
all
things
are
possible
unto
thee
it
be
possible
let
this
cup
pass
away
from
me
nevertheless
not
as
i
will
but
as
thou
wilt
how
long
he
remained
so
in
prayer
we
do
not
know
but
so
great
was
the
tension
of
spirit
that
a
messenger
from
heaven
appeared
and
strengthened
him
even
after
that
being
in
an
agony
he
prayed
more
earnestly
literally
more
stretched
out
more
strainedly
and
his
sweat
became
as
it
were
great
clots
of
blood
falling
down
upon
the
ground
when
at
length
he
arises
from
that
season
of
conflict
and
prayer
the
victory
seems
to
be
won
and
something
of
the
calm
reasserts
itself
he
goes
to
the
sleeping
disciples
and
mindful
of
their
coming
temptation
admonishes
them
to
pray
then
returns
to
the
lonely
solitude
again
for
more
prayer
but
the
change
in
the
form
of
prayer
tells
of
the
triumph
of
soul
o
my
father
if
this
cup
pass
away
except
i
drink
it
thy
will
be
done
the
victory
is
complete
the
crisis
is
past
he
yields
himself
to
that
dreaded
experience
through
which
alone
the
father
loving
plan
for
a
dying
world
can
be
accomplished
again
he
returns
to
the
poor
weak
disciples
and
back
again
for
another
bit
of
strengthening
communion
and
then
the
flickering
glare
of
torches
in
the
distance
tells
him
that
the
hour
is
come
with
steady
step
and
a
marvellous
peace
lighting
his
face
he
goes
out
to
meet
his
enemies
he
overcame
in
this
greatest
crisis
of
his
life
fifteenth
is
the
final
one
of
the
seven
sentences
which
he
spake
upon
the
cross
three
were
prayers
luke
tells
us
that
while
the
soldiers
were
driving
the
nails
through
his
hands
and
feet
and
lifting
the
cross
into
place
he
thinking
even
then
not
of
self
but
of
others
said
father
forgive
them
they
know
not
what
they
do
it
was
as
the
time
of
the
daily
evening
sacrifice
drew
on
near
the
close
of
that
strange
darkness
which
overcast
all
nature
after
a
silence
of
three
hours
that
he
loudly
sobbed
out
the
piercing
cry
my
god
my
god
why
didst
thou
forsake
me
a
little
later
the
triumphant
shout
proclaimed
his
work
done
and
then
the
very
last
word
was
a
prayer
quietly
breathed
out
as
he
yielded
up
his
life
father
into
thy
hands
i
commend
my
spirit
and
so
his
expiring
breath
was
vocalized
into
prayer
u
a
composite
it
may
be
helpful
to
make
the
following
summary
of
these
allusions
times
of
his
regular
habit
seems
plainly
to
have
been
to
devote
the
early
morning
hour
to
communion
with
his
father
and
to
depend
upon
that
for
constant
guidance
and
instruction
this
is
suggested
especially
by
mark
and
also
by
isaiah
coupled
with
john
and
in
addition
to
this
regular
appointment
he
sought
other
opportunities
for
secret
prayer
as
special
need
arose
late
at
night
after
others
had
retired
three
times
he
remained
in
prayer
all
the
night
and
at
irregular
intervals
between
times
note
that
it
was
usually
a
time
when
the
noises
of
earth
were
hushed
he
spent
special
time
in
prayer
important
events
and
also
see
mentions
and
places
of
he
who
said
enter
into
thine
inner
chamber
and
when
thou
hast
shut
the
door
pray
to
thy
father
in
secret
himself
had
no
fixed
inner
chamber
during
his
public
career
to
make
easier
the
habitual
retirement
for
prayer
homeless
for
the
three
and
a
half
years
of
ceaseless
travelling
his
place
of
prayer
was
a
desert
place
the
deserts
the
mountains
a
solitary
place
he
loved
nature
the
hilltop
back
of
nazareth
village
the
slopes
of
olivet
the
hillsides
overlooking
the
galilean
lake
were
his
favourite
places
note
that
it
was
always
a
place
shut
away
from
the
discordant
sounds
of
earth
constant
spirit
of
he
was
never
out
of
the
spirit
of
prayer
he
could
be
alone
in
a
dense
crowd
it
has
been
said
that
there
are
sorts
of
solitude
namely
of
time
as
early
morning
or
late
at
night
solitude
of
place
as
a
hilltop
or
forest
or
a
secluded
room
and
solitude
of
spirit
as
when
one
surrounded
by
a
crowd
may
watch
them
unmoved
or
to
be
lost
to
all
around
in
his
own
inner
thought
jesus
used
all
three
sorts
of
solitude
for
talking
with
his
father
see
mentions
and
prayed
in
the
great
crises
of
his
five
such
are
mentioned
before
the
awful
battle
royal
with
satan
in
the
quarantanian
wilderness
at
the
outset
before
choosing
the
twelve
leaders
of
the
new
movement
at
the
time
of
the
galilean
uprising
before
the
final
departure
from
galilee
for
judea
and
jerusalem
and
in
gethsemane
the
greatest
crisis
of
all
see
mentions
and
he
prayed
for
others
by
name
and
still
does
see
mention
prayed
with
a
habit
that
might
well
be
more
widely
copied
a
few
minutes
spent
in
quiet
prayer
by
friends
or
before
parting
wonderfully
sweetens
the
spirit
and
cements
friendships
and
makes
difficulties
less
difficult
and
hard
problems
easier
of
solution

mentions
and
greatest
blessings
of
his
life
came
during
six
incidents
are
noted
while
praying
the
holy
spirit
came
upon
him
he
was
transfigured
three
times
a
heavenly
voice
of
approval
came
and
in
his
hour
of
sorest
distress
in
the
garden
a
heavenly
messenger
came
to
strengthen
him
see
mentions
and
how
much
prayer
meant
to
jesus
it
was
not
only
his
but
his
resort
in
however
slight
or
serious
when
perplexed
he
when
hard
pressed
by
work
he
when
hungry
for
fellowship
he
found
it
in
he
chose
his
associates
and
received
his
messages
his
if
tempted
he
if
criticised
he
if
fatigued
in
body
or
wearied
in
spirit
he
had
recourse
to
his
one
unfailing
habit
of
brought
him
at
the
beginning
and
the
flow
unbroken
and
undiminished
there
was
no
emergency
no
difficulty
no
necessity
no
temptation
that
would
not
yield
to
prayer
as
he
practiced
it
shall
not
we
who
have
been
tracing
these
steps
in
his
prayer
life
go
back
over
them
again
and
again
until
we
breathe
in
his
very
spirit
of
prayer
and
shall
we
not
too
ask
him
daily
to
teach
us
how
to
pray
and
then
plan
to
get
alone
with
him
regularly
that
he
may
have
opportunity
to
teach
us
and
we
the
opportunity
to
practice
his
teaching
