we
were
both
of
us
not
a
little
stiff
as
the
result
of
sleeping
out
in
the
open
all
that
night
for
even
in
grand
canary
the
and
the
comparative
chill
of
darkness
are
not
to
be
trifled
with
for
myself
on
these
occasions
i
like
a
bit
of
a
run
as
an
early
refresher
but
here
on
this
rough
ground
in
the
middle
of
the
island
there
were
not
three
yards
of
level
to
be
found
and
so
as
coppinger
proceeded
to
go
through
some
sort
of
exercises
with
a
couple
of
lumps
of
bristly
lava
i
followed
his
example
coppinger
has
done
a
good
deal
of
roughing
it
in
his
time
but
being
a
doctor
of
medicine
amongst
other
things
he
takes
out
a
new
degree
of
some
sort
on
an
average
every
other
year
he
is
great
on
health
theories
and
practises
them
like
a
religion
there
had
been
rain
two
days
before
and
as
there
was
still
a
bit
of
stream
trickling
along
at
the
bottom
of
the
barranca
we
went
down
there
and
had
a
wash
and
brushed
our
teeth
greatest
luxury
imaginable
a
toothbrush
on
this
sort
of
expedition
now
said
coppinger
when
we
had
emptied
our
pockets
there
s
precious
little
grub
left
and
it
s
none
the
better
for
being
carried
in
a
local
spanish
yours
is
mostly
tobacco
it
ll
get
worse
if
we
leave
it
we
ve
a
lot
more
bad
scrambling
ahead
of
that
was
obvious
so
we
sat
down
beside
the
stream
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
barranca
and
ate
up
all
of
what
was
left
it
was
a
tramp
to
the
fonda
at
santa
brigida
where
we
had
set
down
our
traps
and
as
coppinger
wanted
to
take
a
lot
more
photographs
and
measurements
before
we
left
this
particular
group
of
caves
it
was
likely
we
should
be
pretty
sharp
set
before
we
got
our
next
meal
and
our
next
taste
of
the
patron
s
splendid
old
country
wine
my
faith
if
only
they
knew
down
in
the
english
hotels
in
las
palmas
what
magnificent
wines
one
could
get
with
diplomacy
up
in
some
of
the
mountain
villages
the
old
vintage
would
become
a
thing
of
the
past
in
a
week
now
to
tell
the
truth
the
two
mummies
he
had
gathered
already
quite
satisfied
my
small
ambition
the
goatskins
in
which
they
were
sewn
up
were
as
brittle
as
paper
and
the
poor
old
things
themselves
gave
out
dust
like
a
puffball
whenever
they
were
touched
but
you
know
what
coppinger
is
he
thought
he
d
come
upon
traces
of
an
old
guanche
university
or
sacred
college
or
something
of
that
kind
like
the
one
there
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
island
and
he
wouldn
t
be
satisfied
till
he
d
ransacked
every
cave
in
the
whole
face
of
the
cliff
he
d
plenty
of
stuff
left
for
the
flashlight
thing
and
more
films
in
his
kodak
and
said
we
might
as
well
get
through
with
the
job
then
as
make
a
return
journey
all
on
purpose
so
he
took
the
crowbar
and
i
shouldered
the
rope
and
away
we
went
up
to
the
ridge
of
the
cliff
where
we
had
got
such
a
baking
from
the
sun
the
day
before
of
course
these
caves
were
not
easy
to
come
at
or
else
they
would
have
been
raided
years
before
coppinger
who
on
principle
makes
out
he
knows
all
about
these
things
says
that
in
the
old
guanche
days
they
had
ladders
of
goatskin
rope
which
they
could
pull
up
when
they
were
at
home
and
so
keep
out
undesirable
callers
and
as
no
other
plan
occurs
to
me
perhaps
he
may
be
right
anyway
the
mouths
of
the
caves
were
in
a
more
or
less
level
row
thirty
feet
below
the
ridge
of
the
cliff
and
fifty
feet
above
the
bottom
and
spanish
curiosity
doesn
t
go
in
much
where
it
can
not
walk
now
laddering
such
caves
from
below
would
have
been
cumbersome
but
a
light
knotted
rope
is
easily
carried
and
though
it
would
have
been
hard
to
climb
up
this
our
plan
was
to
descend
on
each
cave
mouth
from
above
and
then
slip
down
to
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
and
start
again
ab
initio
for
the
next
coppinger
is
plucky
enough
and
he
has
a
good
head
on
a
height
but
there
is
no
getting
over
the
fact
that
he
is
portly
and
nearer
fifty
than
so
you
can
see
he
must
have
been
pretty
keen
of
course
i
went
first
each
time
and
got
into
the
cave
mouth
and
did
what
i
could
to
help
him
in
but
when
you
have
to
walk
down
a
vertical
cliff
face
with
only
a
thin
bootlace
of
a
rope
for
support
it
is
not
much
real
help
the
man
below
can
give
except
offer
you
his
best
wishes
i
wanted
to
save
him
as
much
as
i
could
and
as
the
first
three
caves
i
climbed
to
were
small
and
empty
seeming
to
be
merely
i
asked
him
to
take
them
for
granted
and
save
himself
the
rest
but
he
insisted
on
clambering
down
to
each
one
in
person
and
as
he
decided
that
one
of
my
granaries
was
a
prison
and
another
a
factory
and
another
a
schoolroom
for
young
priests
he
naturally
said
he
hadn
t
much
reliance
on
my
judgment
and
would
have
to
go
through
the
whole
lot
himself
you
know
what
these
archaeologists
are
for
imagination
but
as
the
day
went
on
and
the
sun
rose
higher
coppinger
began
clearly
to
have
had
enough
of
it
though
he
was
very
game
and
insisted
on
going
on
much
longer
than
was
safe
i
must
say
i
didn
t
like
it
you
see
the
drop
was
seldom
less
than
eighty
feet
from
the
top
of
the
cliffs
however
at
last
he
was
forced
to
give
it
up
i
suggested
marching
off
to
santa
brigida
forthwith
but
he
wouldn
t
do
that
there
were
three
more
to
be
looked
into
and
if
i
wouldn
t
do
them
for
him
he
would
have
to
make
another
effort
to
get
there
himself
he
tried
to
make
out
he
was
conferring
a
very
great
favour
on
me
by
offering
to
take
a
report
solely
from
my
untrained
observation
but
i
flatly
refused
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
i
was
pretty
tired
also
i
was
soaked
with
perspiration
from
the
heat
my
head
ached
from
the
violence
of
the
sun
and
my
hands
were
cut
raw
with
the
rope
coppinger
might
be
tired
but
he
was
still
enthusiastic
he
tried
to
make
me
enthusiastic
also
look
here
he
said
there
s
no
knowing
what
you
may
find
up
there
and
if
you
do
lay
hands
on
anything
remember
it
s
your
own
i
shall
have
no
claim
very
kind
of
you
but
i
ve
got
no
use
for
any
more
mummies
done
up
in
goatskin
bah
that
s
not
a
burial
cave
up
there
don
t
you
know
the
difference
yet
in
the
openings
now
be
a
good
fellow
it
doesn
t
follow
that
because
we
have
drawn
all
the
rest
blank
you
won
t
stumble
across
a
good
find
for
yourself
up
oh
very
well
i
said
as
he
seemed
so
set
on
it
and
away
i
stumbled
over
the
fallen
rocks
and
along
the
ledge
and
then
scrambled
up
by
that
fissure
in
the
cliff
which
saved
us
the
round
which
we
had
had
to
take
at
first
i
wrenched
out
the
crowbar
and
jammed
it
down
in
a
new
place
and
then
away
i
went
over
the
side
with
hands
smarting
worse
at
every
new
grip
of
the
rope
it
was
an
awkward
job
swinging
into
the
cave
mouth
because
the
rock
above
overhung
or
else
what
came
to
the
same
thing
it
had
broken
away
below
but
i
managed
it
somehow
although
i
landed
with
an
awkward
thump
on
my
back
and
at
the
same
time
i
didn
t
let
go
the
rope
it
wouldn
t
do
to
have
lost
the
rope
then
coppinger
couldn
t
have
flicked
it
into
me
from
where
he
was
below
now
from
the
first
glance
i
could
see
that
this
cave
was
of
different
structure
to
the
others
they
were
for
the
most
part
mere
dens
rounded
out
anyhow
this
had
been
faced
up
with
cutting
tools
so
that
all
the
angles
were
clean
and
the
sides
smooth
and
flat
the
walls
inclined
inwards
to
the
roof
reminding
me
of
an
architecture
i
had
seen
before
but
could
not
recollect
where
and
moreover
there
were
several
rooms
connected
up
with
passages
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
other
which
coppinger
wanted
me
to
explore
were
merely
the
windows
or
the
doorways
of
two
of
these
other
rooms
of
inscriptions
or
markings
on
the
walls
there
was
not
a
trace
though
i
looked
carefully
and
except
for
bats
the
place
was
entirely
bare
i
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
it
through
coppinger
always
thinks
one
is
slurring
over
work
if
it
is
got
through
too
quickly
and
then
i
went
to
the
entrance
where
the
rope
was
and
leaned
out
and
shouted
down
my
news
he
turned
up
a
very
anxious
face
have
you
searched
it
thoroughly
he
bawled
back
of
course
i
have
what
do
you
think
i
ve
been
doing
all
this
time
no
don
t
come
down
yet
wait
a
minute
i
say
old
man
do
wait
a
minute
i
m
making
fast
the
kodak
and
the
flashlight
apparatus
on
the
end
of
the
rope
pull
them
up
and
just
make
me
half
a
dozen
exposures
there
s
a
good
oh
all
right
i
said
and
hauled
the
things
up
and
got
them
inside
the
photographs
would
be
absolutely
dull
and
uninteresting
but
that
wouldn
t
matter
to
coppinger
he
rather
preferred
them
that
way
one
has
to
be
careful
about
halation
in
photographing
these
dark
interiors
but
there
was
a
sort
of
ledge
like
a
seat
by
the
side
of
each
doorway
and
so
i
lodged
the
camera
on
that
to
get
a
steady
stand
and
snapped
off
the
flashlight
from
behind
and
above
i
got
pictures
of
four
of
the
chambers
this
way
and
then
came
to
one
where
the
ledge
was
higher
and
wider
i
put
down
the
camera
wedged
it
level
with
scraps
of
stone
and
then
sat
down
myself
to
recharge
the
flashlight
machine
but
the
moment
my
weight
got
on
that
ledge
there
was
a
sharp
crackle
and
down
i
went
half
a
dozen
inches
of
course
i
was
up
again
pretty
sharply
and
snapped
up
the
kodak
just
as
it
was
going
to
slide
off
to
the
ground
i
will
confess
too
i
was
feeling
pleased
here
at
any
rate
was
a
guanche
cupboard
of
sorts
and
as
they
had
taken
the
trouble
to
hermetically
seal
it
with
cement
the
odds
were
that
it
had
something
inside
worth
hiding
at
first
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
a
lot
of
dust
and
rubble
so
i
lit
a
bit
of
candle
and
cleared
this
away
presently
however
i
began
to
find
that
i
was
shelling
out
something
that
was
not
cement
it
chipped
away
in
regular
layers
and
when
i
took
it
to
the
daylight
i
found
that
each
layer
was
made
up
of
two
parts
one
side
was
shiny
stuff
that
looked
like
talc
and
on
this
was
smeared
a
coating
of
dark
material
that
might
have
been
wax
the
surface
was
worked
over
with
some
kind
of
pattern
now
i
do
not
profess
to
any
knowledge
on
these
matters
and
as
a
consequence
took
what
coppinger
had
told
me
about
guanche
habits
and
acquirements
as
more
or
less
true
for
instance
he
had
repeatedly
impressed
upon
me
that
this
old
people
could
not
write
and
having
this
in
my
memory
i
did
not
guess
that
the
patterns
scribed
through
the
wax
were
letters
in
some
obsolete
character
which
if
left
to
myself
probably
i
should
have
done
but
still
at
the
same
time
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
stuff
was
worth
looting
and
so
set
to
work
quarrying
it
out
with
the
heel
of
my
boot
and
a
the
sheets
were
all
more
or
less
stuck
together
and
so
i
did
not
go
in
for
separating
them
farther
they
fitted
exactly
to
the
cavity
in
which
they
were
stored
but
by
smashing
down
its
front
i
was
able
to
get
at
the
foot
of
them
and
then
i
hacked
away
through
the
bottom
layers
with
the
knife
till
i
got
the
bulk
out
in
one
solid
piece
it
measured
some
twenty
inches
by
fifteen
by
fifteen
but
it
was
not
so
heavy
as
it
looked
and
when
i
had
taken
the
remaining
photographs
i
lowered
it
down
to
coppinger
on
the
end
of
the
rope
there
was
nothing
more
to
do
in
the
caves
then
so
i
went
down
myself
next
the
lump
of
sheets
was
on
the
ground
and
coppinger
was
on
all
fours
beside
it
he
was
pretty
nearly
mad
with
excitement
what
is
it
i
asked
him
i
don
t
know
yet
but
it
is
the
most
valuable
find
ever
made
in
the
canary
islands
and
it
s
yours
you
unappreciative
beggar
at
least
what
there
is
left
of
it
oh
man
man
you
ve
smashed
up
the
beginning
and
you
ve
smashed
up
the
end
of
some
history
that
is
probably
priceless
it
s
my
own
fault
i
ought
to
have
known
better
than
set
an
untrained
man
to
do
important
exploring
i
should
say
it
s
your
fault
if
anything
s
gone
wrong
you
said
there
was
no
such
thing
as
writing
known
to
these
ancient
canarios
and
i
took
your
word
for
it
for
anything
i
knew
the
stuff
might
have
been
something
to
it
isn
t
guanche
work
at
all
said
he
testily
you
ought
to
have
known
that
from
the
talc
great
heavens
man
have
you
no
eyes
haven
t
you
seen
the
general
formation
of
the
island
don
t
you
know
there
s
no
talc
here
i
m
no
geologist
is
this
imported
literature
then
of
course
it
s
egyptian
that
s
obvious
at
a
glance
though
how
it
s
got
here
i
can
t
tell
yet
it
isn
t
stuff
you
can
read
off
like
a
newspaper
the
character
s
a
variant
on
any
of
those
that
have
been
discovered
so
far
and
as
for
this
waxy
stuff
spread
over
the
talc
it
s
unique
it
s
some
sort
of
a
mineral
i
think
perhaps
asphalt
it
doesn
t
scratch
up
like
animal
wax
i
ll
analyse
that
later
why
they
once
invented
it
and
then
let
such
a
splendid
notion
drop
out
of
use
is
just
a
marvel
i
could
stay
gloating
over
this
all
well
i
said
if
it
s
all
the
same
for
you
i
d
rather
gloat
over
a
meal
it
s
a
good
ten
miles
hard
going
to
the
fonda
and
i
m
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
already
look
here
do
you
know
it
is
four
o
clock
already
it
takes
longer
than
you
think
climbing
down
to
each
of
these
caves
and
then
getting
up
again
for
the
coppinger
spread
his
coat
on
the
ground
and
wrapped
the
lump
of
sheets
with
tender
care
but
would
not
allow
it
to
be
tied
with
a
rope
for
fear
of
breaking
more
of
the
edges
he
insisted
on
carrying
it
himself
too
and
did
so
for
the
larger
part
of
the
way
to
santa
brigida
and
it
was
only
when
he
was
within
an
ace
of
dropping
himself
with
sheer
tiredness
that
he
condescended
to
let
me
take
my
turn
he
was
tolerably
ungracious
about
it
too
i
suppose
you
may
as
well
carry
the
stuff
he
snapped
seeing
that
after
all
it
s
your
personally
when
we
got
to
the
fonda
i
had
as
good
a
dinner
as
was
procurable
and
a
bottle
of
that
old
canary
wine
and
turned
into
bed
after
a
final
pipe
coppinger
dined
also
but
i
have
reason
to
believe
he
did
not
sleep
much
at
any
rate
i
found
him
still
poring
over
the
find
next
morning
and
looking
very
but
brimming
with
enthusiasm
do
you
know
he
said
that
you
ve
blundered
upon
the
most
valuable
historical
manuscript
that
the
modern
world
has
ever
yet
seen
of
course
with
your
clumsy
way
of
getting
it
out
you
ve
done
an
infinity
of
damage
for
instance
those
top
sheets
you
shelled
away
and
spoiled
contained
probably
an
absolutely
unique
account
of
the
ancient
civilisation
of
where
s
that
anyway
in
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
it
s
all
ruins
but
once
it
was
a
very
prosperous
colony
of
the
never
heard
of
them
oh
yes
i
have
though
they
were
the
people
herodotus
wrote
about
didn
t
he
but
i
thought
they
were
they
were
very
real
and
so
was
atlantis
the
continent
where
they
lived
which
lay
just
north
of
the
canaries
what
s
that
crocodile
sort
of
thing
with
wings
drawn
in
the
margin
some
sort
of
beast
that
lived
in
those
bygone
days
the
pages
are
full
of
them
that
s
a
and
that
s
some
sort
of
colossal
bat
thank
goodness
he
had
the
sense
to
illustrate
fully
the
man
who
wrote
this
or
we
should
never
have
been
able
to
reconstruct
the
tale
or
at
any
rate
we
could
not
have
understood
half
of
it
whole
species
have
died
out
since
this
was
written
just
as
a
whole
continent
has
been
swept
away
and
three
civilisations
quenched
the
worst
of
it
is
it
was
written
by
a
man
who
somewhat
naturally
writes
a
very
bad
fist
i
ve
hammered
at
it
all
the
night
through
and
have
only
managed
to
make
out
a
few
sentences
here
and
there
he
rubbed
his
hands
appreciatively
it
will
take
me
a
year
s
hard
work
to
translate
this
every
man
to
his
taste
i
m
afraid
my
interest
in
the
thing
wouldn
t
last
as
long
as
that
but
how
did
it
get
there
did
your
ancient
egyptian
come
to
grand
canary
for
the
good
of
his
lungs
and
write
it
because
he
felt
dull
up
in
that
cave
i
made
a
mistake
there
the
author
was
not
an
egyptian
it
was
the
similarity
of
the
inscribed
character
which
misled
me
the
book
was
written
by
one
deucalion
who
seems
to
have
been
a
priest
or
general
or
perhaps
both
and
he
was
an
atlantean
how
it
got
there
i
don
t
know
yet
probably
that
was
told
in
the
last
few
pages
which
a
certain
vandal
smashed
up
with
his
pocketknife
in
getting
them
away
from
the
place
where
they
were
that
s
right
abuse
me
deucalion
you
say
there
was
a
deucalion
in
the
greek
mythology
he
was
one
of
the
two
who
escaped
from
the
flood
their
noah
in
the
swamping
of
the
continent
of
atlantis
might
very
well
correspond
to
the
is
there
a
pyrrha
then
she
was
deucalion
s
i
haven
t
come
across
her
yet
but
there
s
a
phorenice
who
may
be
the
same
she
seems
to
have
been
the
reigning
empress
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
at
i
looked
with
interest
at
illustrations
in
the
margin
they
were
quite
understandable
although
the
perspective
was
all
wrong
weird
beasts
they
seem
to
have
had
knocking
about
the
country
in
those
days
whacking
big
size
too
if
one
may
judge
by
jove
that
ll
be
a
trying
to
puff
down
a
mammoth
i
shouldn
t
care
to
have
lived
in
those
probably
they
had
some
way
of
fighting
the
creatures
however
that
will
show
itself
as
i
get
along
with
the
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
but
i
haven
t
been
to
bed
are
you
going
out
i
shall
drive
back
to
las
palmas
i
promised
a
man
to
have
a
round
at
golf
this
very
well
see
you
at
dinner
i
hope
they
ve
sent
back
my
dress
shirts
from
the
o
lord
i
am
i
left
him
going
up
to
bed
and
went
outside
and
ordered
a
carriage
to
take
me
down
and
there
i
may
say
we
parted
for
a
considerable
time
a
cable
was
waiting
for
me
in
the
hotel
at
las
palmas
to
go
home
for
business
forthwith
and
there
was
a
liverpool
boat
in
the
harbour
which
i
just
managed
to
catch
as
she
was
steaming
out
it
was
a
close
thing
and
the
boatmen
made
a
small
fortune
out
of
my
hurry
now
coppinger
was
only
an
hotel
acquaintance
and
as
i
was
up
to
the
eyes
in
work
when
i
got
back
to
england
i
m
afraid
i
didn
t
think
very
much
more
about
him
at
the
time
one
doesn
t
with
people
one
just
meets
casually
abroad
like
that
and
it
must
have
been
at
least
a
year
later
that
i
saw
by
a
paragraph
in
one
of
the
papers
that
he
had
given
the
lump
of
sheets
to
the
british
museum
and
that
the
estimated
worth
of
them
was
ten
thousand
pounds
at
the
lowest
valuation
well
this
was
a
bit
of
revelation
and
as
he
had
so
repeatedly
impressed
on
me
that
the
things
were
mine
by
right
of
discovery
i
wrote
rather
a
pointed
note
to
him
mentioning
that
he
seemed
to
have
been
making
rather
free
with
my
property
promptly
came
back
a
stilted
letter
beginning
doctor
coppinger
regrets
and
so
on
and
with
it
the
english
translation
of
the
mss
he
quite
admitted
my
claim
and
trusted
that
the
profits
of
publication
would
be
a
sufficient
reimbursement
for
any
damage
now
i
had
no
idea
that
he
would
take
me
unpleasantly
like
this
and
wrote
back
a
pretty
warm
reply
to
that
effect
but
the
only
answer
i
got
to
this
was
through
a
firm
of
solicitors
who
stated
that
all
further
communications
with
coppinger
must
be
made
through
them
i
will
say
here
publicly
that
i
regret
the
line
he
has
taken
over
the
matter
but
as
the
affair
has
gone
so
far
i
am
disposed
to
follow
out
his
proposition
accordingly
the
old
history
is
here
printed
the
credit
and
the
responsibility
of
the
translation
rests
with
coppinger
and
whatever
revenue
accrues
from
readers
goes
to
the
finder
of
the
original
sheets
myself
if
there
is
a
further
alteration
in
this
arrangement
it
will
be
announced
publicly
at
a
later
date
but
at
present
this
appears
to
be
most
unlikely
my
recall
the
public
official
reception
was
over
the
sentence
had
been
read
the
name
of
phorenice
the
empress
adored
and
the
new
viceroy
installed
with
all
that
vast
and
ponderous
ceremonial
which
had
gained
its
pomp
and
majesty
from
the
ages
formally
i
had
delivered
up
the
reins
of
my
government
formally
tatho
had
seated
himself
on
the
and
had
put
over
his
neck
the
chain
of
gems
which
symbolised
the
supreme
office
and
then
whilst
the
drums
and
the
trumpets
made
their
proclamation
of
clamour
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
for
his
first
state
progress
round
that
gilded
council
chamber
as
viceroy
of
the
province
of
yucatan
with
folded
arms
and
bended
head
i
followed
him
between
the
glittering
lines
of
soldiers
and
the
brilliant
throng
of
courtiers
and
chiefs
and
statesmen
the
quivered
to
the
cries
of
long
live
tatho
flourish
the
empress
which
came
forth
as
in
duty
bound
and
the
new
ruler
acknowledged
the
welcome
with
stately
inclinations
of
the
head
in
turn
he
went
to
the
three
lesser
thrones
of
the
lesser
governors
in
the
east
the
north
and
the
south
and
received
homage
from
each
as
the
ritual
was
and
i
the
man
whom
his
coming
had
deposed
followed
with
the
prescribed
meekness
in
his
train
it
was
a
hard
task
but
we
who
hold
the
higher
offices
learn
to
carry
before
the
people
a
passionless
face
once
twenty
years
before
these
same
fine
obeisances
had
been
made
to
me
now
the
gods
had
seen
fit
to
make
fortune
change
but
as
i
walked
bent
and
humbly
on
behind
the
heels
of
tatho
though
etiquette
forbade
noisy
salutations
to
myself
it
could
not
inhibit
kindly
glances
and
these
came
from
every
soldier
every
courtier
and
every
chief
who
stood
there
in
that
gilded
hall
and
they
fell
upon
me
very
gratefully
it
is
not
often
the
fallen
meet
such
tender
looks
the
form
goes
handed
down
from
immemorial
custom
that
on
these
great
ceremonial
days
of
changing
a
ruler
those
of
the
people
being
present
may
bring
forward
petitions
and
requests
may
make
accusations
against
their
retiring
head
with
sure
immunity
from
his
vengeance
or
may
state
their
own
private
theories
for
the
better
government
of
the
state
in
the
future
i
think
it
may
be
pardoned
to
my
vanity
if
i
record
that
not
a
voice
was
raised
against
me
or
against
any
of
the
items
of
my
twenty
years
of
rule
nor
did
any
speak
out
for
alterations
in
the
future
yes
even
though
we
made
the
circuit
for
the
three
prescribed
times
all
present
showed
their
approval
in
generous
silence
then
one
behind
the
other
the
new
viceroy
and
the
old
we
marched
with
formal
step
over
golden
tiles
of
that
council
hall
beneath
the
pyramid
and
the
great
officers
of
state
left
their
stations
and
joined
in
our
train
and
at
the
farther
wall
we
came
to
the
door
of
those
private
chambers
which
an
hour
ago
had
been
mine
own
ah
well
i
had
no
home
now
in
any
of
those
wondrous
cities
of
yucatan
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
bitterness
though
in
sooth
i
should
have
been
thankful
enough
to
return
to
the
continent
of
atlantis
with
my
head
still
in
its
proper
station
tatho
gave
his
formal
summons
of
open
ye
to
the
viceroy
which
the
ritual
commands
and
the
slaves
within
sent
the
massive
stone
valves
of
the
door
gaping
wide
tatho
entered
i
at
his
heels
the
others
halted
sending
valedictions
from
the
threshold
and
the
valves
of
the
door
clanged
on
the
lock
behind
us
we
passed
on
to
the
chamber
beyond
and
then
when
for
the
first
time
we
were
alone
together
and
the
forced
etiquette
of
courts
was
behind
us
the
new
viceroy
turned
with
meekly
folded
arms
and
bowed
low
before
me
deucalion
he
said
believe
me
that
i
have
not
sought
this
office
it
was
thrust
upon
me
had
i
not
accepted
my
head
would
have
paid
forfeit
and
another
man
your
enemy
would
have
been
sent
out
as
viceroy
in
your
place
the
empress
does
not
permit
that
her
will
shall
ever
be
my
friend
i
made
answer
my
brother
in
all
but
blood
there
is
no
man
living
in
all
atlantis
or
her
territories
to
whom
i
had
liefer
hand
over
my
government
for
twenty
years
now
have
i
ruled
this
country
of
yucatan
and
mexico
beyond
first
under
the
old
king
and
then
as
minister
to
this
new
empress
i
know
my
colony
like
a
book
i
am
intimate
with
all
her
wonderful
cities
with
their
palaces
their
pyramids
and
their
people
i
have
hunted
the
beasts
and
the
savages
in
the
forests
i
have
built
roads
and
made
the
rivers
so
that
they
will
carry
shipping
i
have
fostered
the
arts
and
crafts
like
a
merchant
i
have
discoursed
three
times
each
day
the
cult
of
the
gods
with
mine
own
lips
through
evil
years
and
through
good
have
i
ruled
here
striving
only
for
the
prosperity
of
the
land
and
the
strengthening
of
atlantis
and
i
have
grown
to
love
the
peoples
like
a
father
to
you
i
bequeath
them
tatho
with
tender
supplications
for
their
it
is
not
i
that
can
carry
on
deucalion
s
work
with
deucalion
s
power
but
rest
content
my
friend
that
i
shall
do
my
humble
best
to
follow
exactly
on
in
your
footsteps
believe
me
i
came
out
to
this
government
with
a
thousand
regrets
but
i
would
have
died
sooner
than
take
your
place
had
i
known
how
vigorously
the
supplanting
would
trouble
we
are
alone
here
i
said
away
from
the
formalities
of
formal
assemblies
and
a
man
may
give
vent
to
his
natural
self
without
fear
of
tarnishing
a
ceremony
your
coming
was
something
of
the
suddenest
till
an
hour
ago
when
you
demanded
audience
i
had
thought
to
rule
on
longer
and
even
now
i
do
not
know
for
what
cause
i
am
the
proclamation
said
we
relieve
our
deucalion
of
his
present
service
because
we
have
great
need
of
his
powers
at
home
in
our
kingdom
of
a
mere
tatho
looked
uneasily
round
the
hangings
of
the
chamber
and
drew
me
with
him
to
its
centre
and
lowered
his
voice
i
do
not
think
so
he
whispered
i
believe
she
has
need
of
you
there
are
troublous
times
on
hand
and
phorenice
wants
the
ablest
men
in
the
kingdom
ready
to
her
you
may
speak
openly
i
said
and
without
fear
of
eavesdroppers
we
are
in
the
heart
of
the
pyramid
here
built
in
every
way
by
a
man
s
length
of
solid
stone
myself
i
oversaw
the
laying
of
every
course
and
besides
here
in
yucatan
we
have
not
the
niceties
of
your
old
world
diplomacy
and
do
not
listen
because
we
count
it
shame
to
do
tatho
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
acted
only
according
to
mine
education
at
home
a
loose
tongue
makes
a
loose
head
and
there
are
those
whose
trade
it
is
to
carry
tales
still
what
i
say
is
this
the
throne
shakes
and
phorenice
sees
the
need
of
sturdy
props
so
she
has
sent
this
but
why
come
to
me
it
is
twenty
years
since
i
sailed
to
this
colony
and
from
that
day
i
have
not
returned
to
atlantis
once
i
know
little
of
the
old
country
s
politics
what
small
parcel
of
news
drifts
out
to
us
across
the
ocean
reads
with
slender
interest
here
yucatan
is
another
world
my
dear
tatho
as
you
in
the
course
of
your
government
will
learn
with
new
interests
new
people
new
everything
to
us
here
atlantis
is
only
a
figment
a
shadow
far
away
across
the
waters
it
is
for
this
new
world
of
yucatan
that
i
have
striven
through
all
these
if
deucalion
has
small
time
to
spare
from
his
government
for
brooding
over
his
fatherland
atlantis
at
least
has
found
leisure
to
admire
the
deeds
of
her
brilliant
son
why
sir
over
yonder
at
home
your
name
carries
magic
with
it
when
you
and
i
were
lads
together
it
was
the
custom
in
the
colleges
to
teach
that
the
men
of
the
past
were
the
greatest
this
world
has
ever
seen
but
this
teaching
is
changed
it
is
deucalion
who
is
held
up
as
the
model
and
example
mothers
name
their
sons
deucalion
as
the
most
valuable
they
can
make
deucalion
is
a
household
word
indeed
there
is
only
one
name
that
is
near
to
it
in
you
trouble
me
i
said
frowning
i
have
tried
to
do
my
duty
for
its
own
sake
and
for
the
country
s
sake
not
for
the
pattings
and
fondlings
of
the
vulgar
and
besides
if
there
are
names
to
be
in
every
one
s
mouth
they
should
be
the
names
of
the
tatho
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
gods
they
occupy
us
very
little
these
latter
years
with
our
modern
science
we
have
grown
past
the
tether
of
the
older
gods
and
no
new
one
has
appeared
no
my
lord
deucalion
if
it
were
merely
the
gods
who
were
your
competitors
on
men
s
lips
your
name
would
be
a
thousand
times
the
better
of
mere
human
names
i
said
the
name
of
this
new
empress
should
come
first
in
atlantis
our
lord
the
old
king
being
now
she
certainly
would
have
it
so
replied
tatho
and
there
was
something
in
his
tone
which
made
me
see
that
more
was
meant
behind
the
words
i
drew
him
to
one
of
the
marble
seats
and
bent
myself
familiarly
towards
him
i
am
speaking
i
said
not
to
the
new
viceroy
of
yucatan
but
to
my
old
friend
tatho
a
member
of
the
priests
clan
like
myself
with
whom
i
worked
side
by
side
in
a
score
of
the
smaller
home
governments
in
hamlets
in
villages
in
smaller
towns
in
greater
towns
as
we
gained
experience
in
war
and
knowledge
in
the
art
of
ruling
people
and
so
tediously
won
our
promotion
i
am
speaking
in
tatho
s
private
abode
that
was
mine
own
not
two
hours
since
and
i
would
have
an
answer
with
that
plainness
which
we
always
then
used
to
one
the
new
viceroy
sighed
whimsically
i
almost
forget
how
to
speak
in
plain
words
now
he
said
we
have
grown
so
polished
in
these
latter
days
that
mere
bald
truth
would
be
hissed
as
indelicate
but
for
the
memory
of
those
early
years
when
we
expended
as
much
law
and
thought
over
the
ownership
of
a
as
we
should
now
over
the
fate
of
a
rebellious
city
i
will
try
and
speak
plain
to
you
even
now
deucalion
tell
me
old
friend
what
is
it
what
of
this
new
empress
he
frowned
i
might
have
guessed
your
subject
he
said
then
speak
upon
it
tell
me
of
all
the
changes
that
have
been
made
what
has
this
phorenice
done
to
make
her
throne
unstable
in
atlantis
tatho
frowned
still
if
i
did
not
know
you
to
be
as
honest
as
our
lord
the
sun
your
questions
would
carry
mischief
with
them
phorenice
has
a
short
way
with
those
who
are
daring
enough
to
discuss
her
policies
for
other
purpose
than
politely
to
praise
you
can
leave
me
ignorant
if
you
wish
i
said
with
a
touch
of
chill
this
tatho
seemed
to
be
different
from
the
tatho
i
had
known
at
home
tatho
my
workmate
tatho
who
had
read
with
me
in
the
college
of
priests
who
had
run
with
me
in
many
a
furious
charge
who
had
laboured
with
me
so
heavily
that
the
peoples
under
us
might
prosper
but
he
was
quick
enough
to
see
my
change
of
tone
you
force
me
back
to
my
old
self
he
said
with
a
half
smile
though
it
is
hard
enough
to
forget
the
caution
one
has
learned
during
the
last
twenty
years
even
when
speaking
with
you
still
whatever
may
have
happened
to
the
rest
of
us
it
is
clear
to
see
that
you
at
least
have
not
changed
and
old
friend
i
am
ready
to
trust
you
with
my
life
if
you
ask
it
in
fact
you
do
ask
me
that
very
thing
when
you
tell
me
to
speak
all
i
know
of
i
nodded
this
was
more
like
the
old
times
when
there
was
full
confidence
between
us
the
gods
will
it
now
that
i
return
to
atlantis
i
said
and
what
happens
after
that
the
gods
alone
know
but
it
would
be
of
service
to
me
if
i
could
land
on
her
shores
with
some
knowledge
of
this
phorenice
for
at
present
i
am
as
ignorant
concerning
her
as
some
savage
from
europe
or
what
would
you
have
me
tell
tell
all
i
know
only
that
she
a
woman
reigns
whereby
the
ancient
law
of
the
land
a
man
should
rule
that
she
is
not
even
of
the
priestly
clan
from
which
the
law
says
all
rulers
must
be
drawn
and
that
from
what
you
say
she
has
caused
the
throne
to
totter
the
throne
was
as
firm
as
the
everlasting
hills
in
the
old
king
s
day
history
has
moved
with
pace
since
then
and
phorenice
has
spurred
it
you
know
her
origin
i
know
only
the
exact
little
i
have
told
she
was
a
swineherd
s
daughter
from
the
mountains
though
this
is
never
even
whispered
now
as
she
has
declared
herself
to
be
a
daughter
of
the
gods
with
a
miraculous
birth
and
upbringing
as
she
has
decreed
it
a
sacrilege
to
question
this
parentage
and
has
ordered
to
be
burnt
all
those
that
seem
to
recollect
her
more
earthly
origin
the
fable
passes
current
for
truth
you
see
the
faith
i
put
in
you
deucalion
by
telling
you
what
you
wish
to
there
has
always
been
trust
between
i
know
but
this
habit
of
suspicion
is
hard
to
cast
off
even
with
you
however
let
me
put
your
good
faith
between
me
and
the
torture
further
zaemon
you
remember
was
governor
of
the
swineherd
s
province
and
zaemon
s
wife
saw
phorenice
and
took
her
away
to
adopt
and
bring
up
as
her
own
it
is
said
that
the
swineherd
and
his
woman
objected
perhaps
they
did
anyway
i
know
they
died
and
phorenice
was
taught
the
arts
and
graces
and
brought
up
as
a
daughter
of
the
priestly
but
still
she
was
an
adopted
daughter
only
i
objected
the
omission
of
the
adopted
was
her
will
at
an
early
age
said
tatho
dryly
and
she
learnt
early
to
have
her
wishes
carried
into
fact
it
was
notorious
that
before
she
had
grown
to
fifteen
years
she
ruled
not
only
the
women
of
the
household
but
zaemon
also
and
the
province
that
was
beyond
zaemon
was
learned
i
said
and
a
devout
follower
of
the
gods
and
searcher
into
the
higher
mysteries
but
as
a
ruler
he
was
always
a
flabby
i
do
not
say
that
opportunities
have
not
come
usefully
in
phorenice
s
way
but
she
has
genius
as
well
for
her
to
have
raised
herself
at
all
from
what
she
was
was
remarkable
not
one
woman
out
of
a
thousand
placed
as
she
was
would
have
grown
to
be
aught
higher
than
a
mere
wife
of
some
sturdy
countryman
who
was
sufficiently
simple
to
care
nothing
for
pedigree
but
look
at
phorenice
it
was
her
whim
to
take
exercise
as
a
and
practise
with
all
the
utensils
of
war
and
then
before
any
one
quite
knows
how
or
why
it
happened
a
rebellion
had
broken
out
in
the
province
and
here
was
she
a
slip
of
a
girl
leading
zaemon
s
zaemon
when
i
knew
him
was
a
mere
derision
in
the
hear
me
on
phorenice
put
down
the
rebellion
in
masterly
fashion
and
gave
the
conquered
a
choice
between
sword
and
service
they
fell
into
her
ranks
at
once
and
were
faithful
to
her
from
that
moment
i
tell
you
deucalion
there
is
a
marvellous
fascination
about
the
her
present
historian
seems
to
have
felt
of
course
i
have
every
one
who
sees
her
comes
under
her
spell
and
frankly
i
am
in
love
with
her
also
and
look
upon
my
coming
here
as
detestable
exile
every
one
near
to
phorenice
high
and
low
loves
her
just
the
same
even
though
they
know
it
may
be
her
whim
to
send
them
to
execution
next
perhaps
i
let
my
scorn
of
this
appear
you
feel
contempt
for
our
weakness
you
were
always
a
strong
man
at
any
rate
you
see
me
still
unmarried
i
have
found
no
time
to
palter
with
the
fripperies
of
ah
but
these
colonists
here
are
crude
and
unfascinating
wait
till
you
see
the
ladies
of
the
court
my
it
comes
to
my
mind
i
said
dryly
that
i
lived
in
atlantis
before
i
came
out
here
and
at
that
time
i
used
to
see
as
much
of
court
life
as
most
men
yet
then
also
i
felt
no
inducement
to
tatho
chuckled
atlantis
has
changed
so
that
you
would
hardly
know
the
country
a
new
era
has
come
over
everything
especially
over
the
other
sex
well
do
i
remember
the
women
of
the
old
king
s
time
how
monstrous
uncomely
they
were
how
little
they
knew
how
to
walk
or
carry
themselves
how
painfully
barbaric
was
their
notion
of
dress
i
dare
swear
that
your
ladies
here
in
yucatan
are
not
so
provincial
as
ours
were
then
but
you
should
see
them
now
at
home
they
are
delicious
and
above
all
in
charm
is
the
empress
oh
deucalion
you
shall
see
phorenice
in
all
her
glorious
beauty
and
her
magnificence
one
of
these
fine
days
soon
and
believe
me
you
will
go
down
on
your
knees
and
i
may
see
and
because
you
say
so
i
may
alter
my
life
s
ways
the
gods
make
all
things
possible
but
for
the
present
i
remain
as
i
am
celibate
and
not
wishful
to
be
otherwise
and
so
in
the
meantime
i
would
hear
the
continuance
of
your
it
is
one
long
story
of
success
she
deposed
zaemon
from
his
government
in
name
as
well
as
in
fact
and
the
news
was
spread
and
the
priestly
clan
rose
in
its
wrath
the
two
neighbouring
governors
were
bidden
join
forces
take
her
captive
and
bring
her
for
execution
poor
men
they
tried
to
obey
their
orders
they
attacked
her
surely
enough
but
in
battle
she
could
laugh
at
them
she
killed
both
and
made
some
slaughter
amongst
their
troops
and
to
those
that
remained
alive
and
became
her
prisoners
she
made
her
usual
offer
the
sword
or
service
naturally
they
were
not
long
over
making
their
choice
to
these
common
people
one
ruler
is
much
the
same
as
another
and
so
again
her
army
was
reinforced
three
times
were
bodies
of
soldiery
sent
against
her
and
three
times
was
she
victorious
the
last
was
a
final
effort
before
it
had
been
customary
to
despise
this
adventuress
who
had
sprung
up
so
suddenly
but
then
the
priests
began
to
realise
their
peril
to
see
that
the
throne
itself
was
in
danger
and
to
know
that
if
she
were
to
be
crushed
they
would
have
to
put
forth
their
utmost
every
man
who
could
carry
arms
was
pressed
into
the
service
every
known
art
of
war
was
ordered
to
be
put
into
employment
it
was
the
largest
army
and
the
best
equipped
army
that
atlantis
then
had
ever
raised
and
the
priestly
clan
saw
fit
to
put
in
supreme
command
their
general
you
i
cried
even
myself
deucalion
and
mark
you
i
fought
my
utmost
i
was
not
her
creature
then
and
when
i
set
out
because
they
wanted
to
spur
me
to
the
uttermost
the
high
council
of
the
priests
pointed
out
my
prospects
the
king
we
had
known
so
long
was
ailing
and
wearily
old
he
was
so
wrapped
up
in
the
study
of
the
mysteries
and
the
joy
of
closely
knowing
them
that
earthly
matters
had
grown
nauseous
to
him
and
at
any
time
he
might
decide
to
die
the
priestly
clan
uses
its
own
discretion
in
the
election
of
a
new
king
but
it
takes
note
of
popular
sentiment
and
a
general
who
at
the
critical
time
could
come
home
victorious
from
a
great
campaign
which
moreover
would
release
a
harassed
people
from
the
constant
application
of
arms
would
be
the
idol
of
the
moment
these
things
were
pointed
out
to
me
solemnly
and
in
the
full
what
they
promised
you
the
throne
even
that
so
you
see
i
set
out
with
a
high
stake
before
me
phorenice
i
had
never
seen
and
i
swore
to
take
her
alive
and
give
her
to
be
the
sport
of
my
soldiery
i
had
a
fine
confidence
in
my
own
strategy
then
deucalion
but
the
old
gods
in
whom
i
trusted
then
remained
old
taught
me
no
new
thing
i
drilled
and
exercised
my
army
according
to
the
forms
you
and
i
learnt
together
old
comrade
and
in
many
a
tough
fight
found
to
serve
well
i
armed
them
with
the
choicest
weapons
we
knew
of
then
with
sling
and
mace
with
bow
and
spear
with
axe
and
knife
with
sword
and
the
throwing
fire
their
bodies
i
covered
with
metal
plates
even
their
bellies
i
cared
for
with
droves
of
cattle
driven
in
the
rear
of
the
fighting
troops
but
when
the
encounter
came
they
might
have
been
men
of
straw
for
all
the
harm
they
did
out
of
her
own
brain
phorenice
had
made
that
cast
a
dart
which
would
kill
beyond
two
bowshots
and
the
fashion
in
which
she
handled
her
troops
dazzled
me
they
threatened
us
on
one
flank
they
harassed
us
on
the
other
it
was
not
war
as
we
had
been
accustomed
to
it
was
a
newer
and
more
deadly
game
and
i
had
to
watch
my
splendid
army
eaten
away
as
waves
eat
a
sandhill
never
once
did
i
get
a
chance
of
forcing
close
action
these
new
tactics
that
had
come
from
phorenice
s
invention
were
beyond
my
art
to
meet
or
understand
we
were
eight
to
her
one
and
our
numbers
only
made
us
so
much
the
more
easy
for
slaughter
a
panic
came
and
those
who
could
fled
myself
i
had
no
wish
to
go
back
and
earn
the
axe
that
waits
for
the
unsuccessful
general
i
tried
to
die
there
fighting
where
i
stood
but
death
would
not
come
it
was
a
fine
melee
deucalion
that
last
and
so
she
took
you
i
stood
with
three
others
back
to
back
with
a
ring
of
dead
round
us
and
a
ring
of
the
enemy
hemming
us
in
we
taunted
them
to
come
on
but
at
courtesies
we
had
shown
we
could
hold
our
own
and
so
they
were
calling
for
with
which
they
could
strike
us
down
in
safety
from
a
distance
then
up
came
phorenice
what
is
this
says
she
we
seek
to
kill
lord
tatho
who
led
against
you
say
they
so
that
is
tatho
says
she
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
indeed
and
a
pretty
fighter
seemingly
after
the
old
manner
doubtless
he
is
one
who
would
acquire
the
newer
method
see
now
tatho
says
she
it
is
my
custom
to
offer
those
i
vanquish
either
the
sword
which
believe
me
was
never
nearer
your
neck
than
now
or
service
under
my
banner
will
you
make
a
choice
woman
i
said
fairest
that
ever
i
saw
finest
general
the
world
has
ever
borne
you
tempt
me
sorely
by
your
qualities
but
there
is
a
tradition
in
our
clan
that
we
should
be
true
to
the
salt
we
eat
i
am
the
king
s
man
still
and
so
i
can
take
no
service
from
the
king
is
dead
says
she
a
runner
has
just
brought
the
tidings
meaning
them
to
have
fallen
into
your
hands
and
i
am
the
who
made
you
empress
i
asked
the
same
most
capable
hand
that
has
given
me
this
battle
says
she
it
is
a
capable
hand
as
you
have
seen
it
can
be
a
kind
hand
also
as
you
may
learn
if
you
choose
with
the
king
dead
tatho
is
a
masterless
man
now
is
tatho
in
want
of
a
mistress
such
a
glorious
mistress
as
you
i
said
and
from
that
moment
deucalion
i
have
been
her
slave
oh
you
may
frown
you
may
get
up
from
this
seat
and
walk
away
if
you
will
but
i
ask
you
this
keep
back
your
worst
judgment
of
me
old
friend
till
after
you
have
seen
phorenice
herself
in
the
warm
and
lovely
flesh
then
your
own
ears
and
your
own
senses
will
be
my
advocates
to
win
me
back
your
old
back
to
atlantis
the
words
of
tatho
were
no
sleeping
draught
for
me
that
night
i
began
to
think
that
i
had
made
somewhat
a
mistake
in
wrapping
myself
up
so
entirely
in
my
government
of
yucatan
and
not
contriving
to
keep
more
in
touch
with
events
that
were
passing
at
home
in
atlantis
for
many
years
past
it
had
been
easy
to
see
that
the
mariner
folk
who
did
traffic
across
the
seas
spoke
with
restraint
and
that
only
what
news
the
empress
pleased
was
allowed
to
ooze
out
beyond
her
borders
but
as
i
say
i
was
fully
occupied
with
my
work
in
the
colony
and
had
no
curiosity
to
pull
away
a
veil
intentionally
placed
besides
it
has
always
been
against
my
principles
to
put
to
the
torture
men
who
had
received
orders
for
silence
from
their
superiors
merely
that
they
shall
break
these
orders
for
my
private
convenience
however
the
iron
discipline
of
our
priestly
clan
left
me
no
choice
of
procedure
as
was
customary
i
had
been
deprived
of
my
office
at
a
moment
s
notice
from
that
time
on
all
papers
and
authority
belonged
to
my
successor
and
although
by
courtesy
i
might
be
permitted
to
remain
as
a
guest
in
the
pyramid
that
had
so
recently
been
mine
to
see
another
sunrise
it
was
clearly
enjoined
that
i
must
leave
the
territory
then
at
the
topmost
of
my
speed
and
hasten
to
report
in
atlantis
tatho
to
give
him
credit
was
anxious
to
further
my
interests
to
the
utmost
in
his
power
he
was
by
my
side
again
before
the
dawn
putting
all
his
resources
at
my
disposal
i
had
little
enough
to
ask
him
a
ship
to
take
me
home
i
said
and
i
shall
be
your
the
request
seemed
to
surprise
him
that
you
may
certainly
have
if
you
wish
it
but
my
ships
are
foul
with
the
long
passage
and
are
in
need
of
a
careen
if
you
take
them
you
will
make
a
slow
voyage
of
it
to
atlantis
why
do
you
not
take
your
own
navy
the
ships
are
in
harbour
now
for
i
saw
them
there
when
we
came
in
brave
ships
they
are
but
not
mine
that
navy
belongs
to
well
deucalion
you
are
yucatan
or
rather
you
were
yesterday
and
have
been
these
twenty
i
saw
what
he
meant
and
the
idea
did
not
please
me
i
answered
stiffly
enough
that
the
ships
were
owned
by
private
merchants
or
belonged
to
the
state
and
i
could
not
claim
so
much
as
a
galley
tatho
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
you
know
your
own
policies
best
he
said
though
to
me
it
seems
but
risky
for
a
man
who
has
attained
to
a
position
like
yours
and
mine
not
to
have
provided
himself
with
a
stout
navy
of
his
own
one
never
knows
when
a
recall
may
be
sent
and
through
lack
of
these
precautions
a
life
s
earnings
may
very
well
be
lost
in
a
dozen
i
have
no
fear
for
mine
i
said
coldly
of
course
not
because
you
know
me
to
be
your
friend
but
had
another
man
been
appointed
to
this
you
might
have
been
sadly
shorn
deucalion
it
is
not
many
fellows
who
can
resist
a
snug
hoard
ready
and
waiting
in
the
very
coffers
they
have
come
to
my
lord
tatho
i
said
it
is
clear
to
me
that
you
and
i
have
grown
to
be
of
different
tastes
all
of
the
hoard
that
i
have
made
for
myself
in
this
colony
few
men
would
covet
i
have
the
poor
clothes
you
see
me
in
this
moment
and
a
box
of
drugs
such
as
i
have
found
useful
to
the
stomach
i
possess
also
three
slaves
two
of
them
scribes
and
the
third
a
sturdy
savage
from
europe
who
cooks
my
victual
and
fills
for
me
the
bath
for
my
maintenance
during
my
years
of
service
here
i
have
bled
the
state
of
a
soldier
s
ration
and
nothing
beyond
and
if
in
my
name
any
man
has
mulcted
a
creature
in
yucatan
of
so
much
as
an
ounce
of
bronze
i
request
you
as
a
last
service
to
have
that
man
hanged
for
me
as
a
liar
and
a
tatho
looked
at
me
curiously
i
do
not
know
whether
i
admire
you
most
or
whether
i
pity
i
do
not
know
whether
to
be
astonished
or
to
despise
we
had
heard
of
much
of
your
uprightness
over
yonder
in
atlantis
of
your
sternness
and
your
justice
but
i
swear
by
the
old
gods
that
no
soul
guessed
you
carried
your
fancy
so
far
as
this
why
man
money
is
power
with
money
and
the
resources
money
can
buy
nothing
could
stop
a
fellow
like
you
whilst
without
it
you
may
be
tripped
up
and
trodden
down
irrevocably
at
the
first
puny
the
gods
will
choose
my
possibly
but
for
mine
i
prefer
to
nourish
it
myself
i
tell
you
with
frankness
that
i
have
not
come
here
to
follow
in
the
pattern
you
have
made
for
a
i
shall
govern
yucatan
wisely
and
well
to
the
best
of
my
ability
but
i
shall
govern
it
also
for
the
good
of
tatho
the
viceroy
i
have
brought
with
me
here
my
navy
of
eight
ships
and
a
personal
bodyguard
there
is
my
wife
also
and
her
women
and
her
slaves
all
these
must
be
provided
for
and
why
indeed
should
it
be
otherwise
if
a
people
is
to
be
governed
it
should
be
their
privilege
to
pay
handsomely
for
their
we
shall
not
agree
on
this
you
have
the
power
now
and
can
employ
it
as
you
choose
if
i
thought
it
would
be
of
any
use
i
should
like
to
supplicate
you
most
humbly
to
deal
with
lenience
when
you
come
to
tax
these
people
who
are
under
you
they
have
grown
very
dear
to
i
have
disgusted
you
with
me
and
i
am
grieved
for
it
but
even
to
retain
your
good
opinion
deucalion
which
i
value
more
than
that
of
any
man
living
i
can
not
do
here
as
you
have
done
it
would
be
impossible
even
if
i
wished
it
you
must
not
judge
all
other
men
by
your
own
strong
standard
a
tatho
is
by
no
means
a
colossus
like
a
deucalion
and
besides
i
have
a
wife
and
children
and
they
must
be
provided
for
even
if
i
neglect
ah
there
i
said
it
does
seem
that
i
possess
the
advantage
i
have
no
wife
to
clog
he
caught
up
my
word
quickly
it
seems
to
me
you
have
nothing
that
makes
life
worth
living
you
have
neither
wife
children
riches
cooks
retinue
dresses
nor
anything
else
in
proportion
to
your
station
you
will
pardon
my
saying
it
old
comrade
but
you
are
plaguey
ignorant
about
some
matters
for
example
you
do
not
know
how
to
dine
during
every
day
of
a
very
weary
voyage
i
have
promised
myself
when
sitting
before
the
meagre
sea
victual
that
presently
the
abstinence
would
be
more
than
repaid
by
deucalion
s
welcoming
feast
oh
i
tell
you
that
feast
was
one
of
the
vividest
things
that
ever
came
before
my
eyes
and
then
when
we
get
to
the
actuality
what
was
it
why
a
country
farmer
every
day
sits
down
to
more
delicate
fare
you
told
me
how
it
was
prepared
well
your
savage
from
europe
may
be
lusty
and
perchance
is
faithful
but
he
is
a
cook
gods
i
have
lived
better
on
a
campaign
i
know
this
is
a
colony
here
without
any
of
the
home
refinements
but
if
in
the
days
to
come
the
deer
of
the
forest
the
fish
of
the
stream
and
the
other
resources
of
the
place
are
not
put
to
better
use
than
heretofore
i
shall
see
it
my
duty
as
ruler
to
fry
some
of
the
kitchen
staff
alive
in
grease
so
as
to
encourage
better
cookery
gods
deucalion
have
you
forgotten
what
it
is
to
have
a
palate
and
have
you
no
esteem
for
your
own
dignity
man
look
at
your
clothes
you
are
garbed
like
a
herdsman
and
you
have
not
a
gaud
or
a
jewel
to
brighten
i
eat
i
said
coldly
when
my
hunger
bids
me
and
i
carry
this
one
robe
upon
my
person
till
it
is
worn
out
and
needs
replacement
the
grossness
of
excessive
banqueting
and
the
effeminacy
of
many
clothes
are
attainments
that
never
met
my
fancy
but
i
think
we
have
talked
here
over
long
and
there
seems
little
chance
of
our
finding
agreement
you
have
changed
tatho
with
the
years
and
perhaps
i
have
changed
also
these
alterations
creep
imperceptibly
into
one
s
being
as
time
advances
let
us
part
now
and
forgetting
these
present
differences
remember
only
our
friendship
of
twenty
years
agone
that
for
me
at
any
rate
has
always
had
a
pleasant
savour
when
called
up
into
the
tatho
bowed
his
head
so
be
it
he
said
and
i
would
still
charge
myself
upon
your
bounty
for
that
ship
dawn
can
not
be
far
off
now
and
it
is
not
decent
that
the
man
who
has
ruled
here
so
long
should
walk
in
daylight
through
the
streets
on
the
morning
after
his
so
be
it
said
tatho
you
shall
have
my
poor
navy
i
could
have
wished
that
you
had
asked
me
something
not
the
navy
tatho
one
small
ship
believe
me
more
is
now
there
said
tatho
i
shall
act
the
tyrant
i
am
viceroy
here
now
and
will
have
my
way
in
this
you
may
go
naked
of
all
possessions
that
i
can
not
help
but
depart
for
atlantis
unattended
that
you
shall
and
so
in
fine
as
the
choice
was
set
beyond
me
it
was
in
the
bear
tatho
s
own
private
ship
with
all
the
rest
of
his
navy
sailing
in
escort
that
i
did
finally
make
my
transit
but
the
start
was
not
immediate
the
vessels
lay
moored
against
the
stone
quays
of
the
inner
harbour
gutted
of
their
stores
and
with
crews
exhausted
and
it
would
have
been
suicide
to
have
forced
them
out
then
and
there
to
again
take
the
seas
so
the
courtesies
were
fulfilled
by
the
craft
whereon
i
abode
hauling
out
into
the
entrance
basin
and
anchoring
there
in
the
swells
of
the
fairway
and
forthwith
she
and
her
consorts
took
in
wood
and
water
cured
meat
and
fish
ashore
and
refitted
in
all
needful
ways
with
all
speed
attainable
for
myself
there
came
then
as
the
first
time
during
twenty
busy
years
a
breathing
space
from
work
i
had
no
further
connection
with
the
country
of
my
labours
indeed
officially
i
had
left
it
already
into
the
working
of
the
ship
it
was
contrary
to
rule
that
i
should
make
any
inspection
or
interest
since
all
sea
matters
were
the
exclusive
property
of
the
mariners
guild
secured
to
them
by
royal
patent
and
most
jealously
guarded
so
there
remained
to
me
in
my
day
hours
to
gaze
if
i
would
upon
the
quays
the
harbours
the
palaces
and
the
pyramids
of
the
splendid
city
before
me
which
i
had
seen
grow
stone
by
stone
from
its
foundations
or
to
roam
my
eye
over
the
pastures
and
the
grain
lands
beyond
the
walls
and
to
look
longingly
at
the
dense
forests
behind
from
which
field
by
field
we
had
so
tediously
ripped
our
territory
would
tatho
continue
the
work
so
healthily
begun
i
trusted
so
even
in
spite
of
his
selfish
words
and
at
all
hours
during
the
radiance
of
our
lord
the
sun
or
under
the
stars
of
night
i
was
free
to
pursue
that
study
of
the
higher
mysteries
on
which
we
of
the
priests
clan
are
trained
to
set
our
minds
without
aid
of
book
or
instrument
of
image
or
temple
the
refitting
of
the
navy
was
gone
about
with
speed
never
it
is
said
had
ships
been
reprovisioned
and
caulked
and
remanned
with
greater
speed
for
the
voyage
indeed
it
was
barely
over
a
month
from
the
day
that
they
brought
up
in
the
harbour
they
put
out
beyond
the
walls
and
began
their
voyage
eastward
over
the
hills
and
dale
of
the
ocean
from
europe
for
this
long
passage
of
sea
are
not
taken
now
owing
to
the
difficulty
in
provisioning
them
for
modern
humanity
forbids
the
practice
of
letting
them
eat
one
another
according
to
the
home
custom
of
their
continent
sails
alone
are
but
an
indifferent
stand
by
but
modern
science
has
shown
how
to
extract
force
from
the
sun
when
he
is
free
from
cloud
and
this
in
a
manner
kept
secret
by
mariners
is
made
to
draw
at
the
forepart
of
the
vessel
and
eject
it
with
such
force
at
the
stern
that
she
is
appreciably
driven
forward
even
with
the
wind
adverse
in
another
matter
also
has
navigation
vastly
improved
it
is
not
necessary
now
as
formerly
to
trust
wholly
to
a
starry
night
when
beyond
sight
of
land
to
find
direction
a
little
image
has
been
made
and
is
stood
balanced
in
the
forepart
of
every
vessel
with
an
arm
outstretched
pointing
constantly
to
the
direction
where
the
southern
cross
lies
in
the
heavens
so
by
setting
an
angle
can
a
just
course
be
correctly
steered
other
instruments
have
they
also
for
finding
a
true
position
on
the
ocean
wastes
for
the
newer
mariner
when
he
is
at
sea
puts
little
trust
in
the
gods
and
confides
mightily
in
his
own
thews
and
wits
still
it
is
amusing
to
see
these
tarry
fellows
even
in
this
modern
day
take
their
last
farewell
of
the
harbour
town
the
ship
is
stowed
and
all
ready
for
sea
and
they
wash
and
put
on
all
their
bravery
of
attire
ashore
they
go
their
faces
long
with
piety
and
seek
some
obscure
temple
whose
god
has
little
flavour
with
shore
folk
and
here
they
make
sacrifice
with
clamour
and
lavish
outlay
and
finally
there
follows
a
feast
in
honour
of
the
god
and
they
arrive
back
on
board
and
put
to
sea
for
the
most
part
drunken
and
all
heavy
and
with
gluttony
and
their
other
excesses
the
voyage
was
very
different
to
my
previous
there
was
no
creeping
timorously
along
in
touch
with
the
coasts
we
stood
straight
across
the
open
gulf
in
the
direction
of
home
came
up
with
the
band
of
the
carib
islands
and
worked
confidently
through
them
as
though
they
had
been
signposts
to
mark
the
sea
highway
and
stopped
only
twice
to
replenish
with
wood
water
and
fruit
these
commodities
too
the
savages
brought
us
freely
so
great
was
their
subjection
and
in
neither
place
did
we
have
even
the
semblance
of
a
fight
it
was
a
great
certificate
of
the
growing
power
of
atlantis
and
her
finest
colony
then
boldly
on
we
went
across
the
vast
ocean
beyond
with
never
a
sacrifice
to
implore
the
gods
that
they
should
help
our
direction
one
might
feel
censure
towards
these
rugged
mariners
for
their
impiety
but
one
could
not
help
an
admiration
for
their
lusty
skill
and
confidence
the
dangers
of
the
desolate
sea
are
dealt
out
as
the
gods
will
and
man
can
only
take
them
as
they
come
storms
we
encountered
and
the
mariners
fought
them
with
stubborn
endurance
twice
a
blazing
stone
from
heaven
hissed
into
the
sea
beside
us
though
without
injuring
any
of
our
ships
and
as
was
unavoidable
the
great
beasts
of
the
sea
hunted
us
with
their
accustomed
savagery
but
only
once
did
we
suffer
material
loss
from
these
last
and
that
was
when
three
of
the
greater
sea
lizards
attacked
the
bear
the
ship
whereon
i
travelled
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
hour
of
their
onset
was
during
the
blazing
midday
heat
and
the
sun
being
at
the
full
of
his
power
our
machines
were
getting
full
force
from
him
the
vessel
was
travelling
forward
faster
than
a
man
on
dry
land
could
walk
but
for
the
power
escape
she
might
as
well
have
been
standing
still
when
the
beasts
sighted
her
there
were
three
of
them
as
i
have
said
and
we
saw
them
come
up
over
the
curve
of
the
horizon
beating
the
sea
into
foam
with
their
flappers
and
waving
their
great
necks
like
masts
as
they
swam
our
navy
was
spread
out
in
a
long
line
of
ships
and
in
olden
days
each
of
the
beasts
would
have
selected
a
separate
prey
and
proceeded
for
it
but
like
man
these
beasts
have
learned
the
necessities
of
warfare
and
they
hunt
in
pack
now
and
do
not
separate
their
forces
it
was
plain
they
were
making
for
our
ship
and
tob
the
captain
would
have
had
me
go
into
the
and
there
be
secure
from
their
marauding
he
was
responsible
to
the
lord
tatho
he
said
for
my
safe
conduct
it
was
certain
that
the
beasts
would
contrive
to
seize
some
of
the
ship
s
company
before
they
were
satiated
and
if
the
hap
came
to
the
lord
deucalion
he
the
captain
would
have
to
give
himself
voluntarily
to
the
beasts
then
to
escape
a
very
painful
death
at
tatho
s
hands
later
on
however
my
mind
was
set
a
man
can
never
have
too
much
experience
in
fighting
enemies
whether
human
or
bestial
and
the
attack
of
these
creatures
was
new
to
me
and
i
was
fain
to
learn
its
method
so
i
gave
the
captain
a
letter
to
tatho
saying
how
the
matter
lay
and
for
which
it
may
be
mentioned
the
rude
fellow
seemed
little
enough
grateful
and
stayed
in
my
chair
under
the
awning
the
beasts
surged
up
to
us
with
champing
jaws
and
all
the
shipmen
stood
armed
on
their
defence
they
came
up
alongside
two
females
the
smaller
on
the
flank
of
the
ship
the
giant
male
by
himself
on
the
other
their
great
heads
swooped
about
as
high
as
the
yards
that
held
the
sails
and
the
reek
from
them
gave
one
physical
sickness
the
shipmen
faced
the
monsters
with
a
sturdy
courage
arrows
were
useless
against
the
smooth
hides
even
the
throwing
fire
could
not
so
much
as
singe
them
nothing
but
twenty
axe
blows
delivered
on
an
attacking
head
together
could
beat
it
back
and
even
these
succeeded
only
through
sheer
weight
of
metal
and
did
not
make
so
much
as
the
scratch
of
a
wound
during
all
time
beasts
have
disputed
with
man
the
mastery
of
the
earth
and
it
is
only
in
atlantis
and
egypt
and
yucatan
that
man
has
dared
to
hold
his
own
and
fight
them
with
a
mind
made
strong
by
many
previous
victories
in
europe
and
the
greater
beasts
hold
full
dominion
and
man
admits
his
puny
number
and
force
and
lives
in
earth
crannies
and
the
higher
as
a
fugitive
confessed
and
upon
the
great
oceans
the
beasts
are
lords
unchecked
still
here
upon
this
desolate
sea
although
the
giant
lizards
were
new
to
me
it
was
a
pleasure
to
pit
my
knowledge
of
war
against
their
brute
strength
and
courage
ever
since
the
first
men
did
their
business
upon
the
great
waters
they
fulfilled
their
instincts
in
fighting
the
beasts
with
desperation
hiding
in
a
hold
was
useless
for
if
this
enemy
could
not
find
men
above
decks
to
glut
them
they
would
break
a
ship
with
their
paddles
and
so
all
would
be
slain
and
so
it
was
recognised
that
the
fight
should
go
forward
as
desperately
as
might
be
and
that
it
could
only
end
when
the
beasts
had
got
their
prey
and
had
gone
away
satisfied
it
was
in
a
conflict
after
this
fashion
then
that
i
found
myself
and
felt
the
joy
once
more
to
have
my
thews
in
action
but
after
my
axe
had
got
in
some
dozen
lusty
blows
which
for
all
the
harm
they
did
might
have
been
delivered
against
some
city
wall
or
indeed
against
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
itself
i
sought
about
me
till
i
found
a
lance
and
with
that
made
very
different
play
the
eyes
of
these
lizards
are
small
and
set
deep
in
a
bony
socket
but
i
judged
them
to
be
vulnerable
and
it
was
upon
the
eyes
of
the
beast
that
i
made
my
attack
the
decks
were
slippery
with
the
horrid
slime
of
them
the
crew
surged
about
in
their
battling
and
moreover
constantly
offered
themselves
as
a
rampart
before
me
by
reason
of
tob
the
captain
s
threats
but
i
gave
a
few
shrewd
progues
with
the
lance
to
show
that
i
did
not
choose
my
will
to
be
overridden
and
presently
was
given
room
for
manoeuvre
deliberately
i
placed
myself
in
the
sight
of
one
of
the
lizards
and
offered
my
body
to
its
attack
the
challenge
was
accepted
it
swooped
like
a
dropping
stone
and
i
swerved
and
drove
in
the
lance
at
its
oozy
eye
i
thanked
the
gods
then
that
i
had
been
trained
with
the
lance
till
certain
aim
was
a
matter
of
instinct
with
me
the
blade
went
true
to
its
mark
and
stuck
there
and
the
shaft
broke
in
my
hand
the
beast
drew
off
blinded
and
bellowing
and
beating
the
sea
with
its
paddles
in
a
great
cataract
of
foam
i
saw
it
bend
its
great
long
neck
and
rub
its
head
with
the
spear
still
fixed
against
its
back
thereby
enduring
new
agonies
but
without
dislodging
the
weapon
and
then
presently
finding
this
of
no
avail
it
set
off
for
the
place
from
which
it
came
with
extraordinary
quickness
and
rapidly
grew
smaller
against
the
horizon
the
male
and
the
other
female
lizard
had
also
left
us
but
not
in
similar
plight
tob
the
captain
seeing
my
resolve
to
take
hazards
deliberately
thrust
a
shipman
into
the
jaws
of
each
of
the
others
so
that
they
might
be
sated
and
get
them
gone
it
was
clear
that
tob
dreaded
very
much
for
his
own
skin
if
i
came
by
harm
and
i
thought
with
a
warming
heart
of
the
threats
that
tatho
must
have
used
in
his
kind
anxiety
for
my
safety
it
is
pleasant
when
one
s
old
friends
do
not
omit
to
pay
these
little
attentions
a
rival
navy
now
when
we
came
up
with
the
coasts
of
atlantis
though
tob
with
the
aid
of
his
modern
instruments
had
made
his
landfall
with
most
marvellous
skill
and
nearness
there
still
remained
some
ten
days
more
journey
in
which
we
had
to
retrace
our
course
till
we
came
to
that
arm
of
the
sea
up
which
lies
the
great
city
of
atlantis
the
capital
the
sight
of
the
land
and
the
breath
of
earth
and
herbage
which
came
off
from
it
with
the
breezes
were
i
believe
under
the
gods
the
means
of
saving
the
lives
of
all
of
us
for
as
is
necessary
with
long
voyages
many
of
our
ships
companies
had
died
and
still
more
were
sick
with
scurvy
through
the
unnatural
tossing
or
as
some
have
it
through
the
salt
unnatural
food
inseparable
from
shipboard
but
these
last
the
sight
and
the
smells
of
land
heartened
up
in
extraordinary
fashion
and
from
being
helpless
logs
unable
to
move
even
under
blows
of
the
scourge
they
became
active
again
able
to
help
in
the
shipwork
and
lusty
when
the
time
came
to
fight
for
their
lives
and
their
vessels
from
the
moment
that
i
was
deposed
in
yucatan
despite
tatho
s
assurances
there
had
been
doubts
in
my
mind
as
to
what
nature
would
be
my
reception
in
atlantis
but
i
had
faced
this
event
of
the
future
without
concern
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
the
empress
phorenice
might
be
supreme
on
earth
she
might
cause
my
head
to
be
lopped
from
its
proper
shoulders
the
moment
i
set
foot
ashore
but
my
lord
the
sun
was
above
phorenice
and
if
my
head
fell
it
would
be
because
he
saw
best
that
it
should
be
so
on
which
account
therefore
i
had
not
troubled
myself
about
the
matter
during
the
voyage
but
had
followed
out
my
calm
study
of
the
higher
mysteries
with
an
unloaded
mind
but
when
our
navy
had
retraced
sufficiently
the
course
that
had
been
overrun
and
came
up
with
the
two
vast
headlands
which
marked
the
entrance
to
the
inland
waters
there
a
bare
two
days
from
the
atlantis
capital
we
met
with
another
navy
which
was
beyond
doubt
waiting
to
give
us
a
reception
the
ships
were
riding
at
anchor
in
a
bay
which
lent
them
shelter
but
they
had
scouts
on
the
high
land
above
who
cried
the
alarm
of
our
approach
and
when
we
rounded
the
headland
they
were
standing
out
to
dispute
our
passage
of
us
there
were
now
but
five
ships
the
rest
having
been
lost
in
storms
or
fallen
behind
because
all
their
crews
were
dead
from
the
scurvy
and
of
the
strangers
there
were
three
fine
ships
and
three
galleys
of
many
oars
apiece
they
were
clean
and
bright
and
black
our
ships
were
and
and
had
bottoms
that
were
foul
with
trailing
ocean
weed
our
ships
hung
out
the
colours
and
signs
of
tatho
and
deucalion
openly
and
without
shame
so
that
all
who
looked
might
know
their
origin
and
errand
but
the
other
navy
came
on
without
banner
or
antient
as
though
they
were
some
low
creatures
feeling
shame
for
their
birth
clear
it
seemed
also
that
they
would
not
let
us
pass
without
a
fight
and
in
this
there
was
nothing
uncommon
for
no
law
carries
out
over
the
seas
and
a
brother
in
one
ship
feels
quite
free
to
harry
his
brother
in
another
vessel
if
he
meets
him
out
of
earshot
of
the
beach
more
especially
if
that
other
brother
be
coming
home
laden
from
foray
or
trading
tour
so
tob
with
system
and
method
got
our
vessel
into
fighting
trim
and
the
other
four
captains
did
the
like
with
theirs
and
drew
close
in
to
us
to
form
a
compact
squadron
they
had
no
wish
to
smell
slavery
now
that
the
voyage
had
come
so
near
to
its
end
our
lord
the
sun
shone
brilliantly
giving
full
speed
to
the
machines
as
though
he
was
fully
willing
for
the
affair
to
proceed
and
the
two
navies
approached
one
another
with
quickness
the
three
galleys
holding
back
to
stay
in
line
with
their
consorts
but
when
some
bare
hundred
separated
us
the
other
navy
halted
and
one
of
the
galleys
drawing
ahead
flew
green
branches
from
her
masts
seeking
for
a
parley
the
course
was
unusual
but
we
in
our
state
were
no
navy
to
invite
a
fight
unnecessarily
so
in
hoarse
word
was
passed
and
we
too
halted
and
tob
hoisted
a
withered
stick
which
had
to
do
duty
for
greenery
to
show
that
we
were
ready
for
talk
and
would
respect
the
person
of
an
ambassador
the
galley
drew
on
swung
round
and
backed
till
its
stern
rasped
on
our
shield
rail
and
one
of
her
people
clambered
up
and
jumped
down
upon
our
decks
he
was
a
dandily
fellow
young
and
lusty
and
all
healthy
from
the
land
and
land
victual
and
he
looked
round
him
with
a
sneer
at
our
and
with
a
fine
then
seeing
tob
he
nodded
as
one
meets
an
acquaintance
old
he
said
your
woman
waits
for
you
up
by
the
in
atlantis
yonder
with
four
youngsters
at
her
heels
i
saw
her
not
half
a
month
you
didn
t
come
out
here
to
tell
me
home
news
said
tob
that
i
ll
be
sworn
i
ve
drunk
enough
pots
with
you
dason
to
know
your
pleasantries
i
wanted
to
point
out
to
you
that
your
home
is
still
there
with
your
wife
and
children
ready
to
welcome
i
am
not
a
man
that
ever
forgets
it
said
tob
grimly
and
because
i
ve
got
them
always
at
the
back
of
my
mind
i
ve
sailed
this
ship
over
the
top
of
more
than
one
pirate
when
if
i
d
been
a
single
man
i
might
have
been
e
en
content
to
take
the
hap
of
oh
i
know
you
re
a
desperate
enough
fellow
said
dason
and
i
m
free
to
confess
that
if
it
does
come
to
blows
we
are
like
to
lose
a
few
men
before
we
get
you
and
your
cripples
here
and
your
crazy
ships
comfortably
sunk
our
navy
has
its
orders
to
carry
out
and
the
cause
of
my
embassage
is
this
we
wish
to
see
if
you
will
act
the
sensible
part
and
give
us
what
we
want
and
so
be
permitted
to
go
on
your
way
home
with
a
skin
that
is
unslit
and
dry
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
bird
here
for
a
plucking
said
tob
with
a
heavy
laugh
we
took
no
treasure
or
merchandise
on
board
in
yucatan
we
stayed
in
harbour
long
enough
to
cure
our
sea
victual
and
fill
with
food
and
water
and
no
longer
we
sail
back
as
we
sailed
out
barren
ships
you
will
not
believe
me
of
course
i
would
not
have
believed
you
had
our
places
been
changed
but
you
may
go
into
the
holds
and
search
if
you
choose
you
will
find
there
nothing
but
a
few
poor
sailormen
half
in
pieces
with
the
scurvy
no
you
can
steal
nothing
here
but
blows
dason
and
we
will
give
you
those
with
but
little
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
state
your
cargo
at
such
slender
value
said
the
envoy
for
it
is
the
cargo
i
must
take
back
with
me
on
the
galley
if
you
are
to
earn
your
safe
conduct
to
tob
knit
his
brows
you
had
better
speak
more
plain
he
said
i
am
a
common
sailor
and
do
not
understand
fancy
it
is
clear
to
see
said
dason
that
you
have
been
set
to
bring
deucalion
back
to
atlantis
as
a
prop
for
phorenice
well
we
others
find
phorenice
hard
enough
to
fight
against
without
further
reinforcements
and
so
we
want
deucalion
in
our
own
custody
to
deal
with
after
our
own
and
if
i
do
the
miser
and
deny
you
this
piece
of
my
freight
the
spruce
envoy
looked
round
at
the
splintered
ship
and
the
battered
navy
beside
her
why
then
tob
we
shall
send
you
all
to
the
fishes
in
very
short
time
and
instead
of
deucalion
standing
before
the
gods
alone
he
will
go
down
with
a
fine
ragged
company
limping
at
his
i
doubt
it
said
tob
but
we
shall
see
as
for
letting
you
have
my
lord
deucalion
that
is
out
of
the
question
for
see
here
dason
in
the
first
place
if
i
went
to
atlantis
without
deucalion
my
other
lord
tatho
would
come
back
one
of
these
days
and
in
his
hands
i
should
die
by
the
slowest
of
slow
inches
in
the
second
i
have
seen
my
lord
deucalion
kill
a
great
sea
lizard
and
he
showed
himself
such
a
proper
man
that
day
that
i
would
not
give
him
up
against
his
will
even
to
tatho
himself
and
in
the
third
place
you
owe
me
for
your
share
in
our
last
ashore
and
i
ll
see
you
with
the
nether
gods
before
i
give
you
aught
till
you
ve
settled
that
well
tob
i
hope
you
ll
drown
easy
as
for
that
wife
of
yours
i
ve
always
had
a
fancy
for
her
myself
and
i
shall
know
how
to
find
a
use
for
the
i
ll
draw
your
neck
for
that
you
son
of
a
european
said
tob
and
if
you
do
not
clear
off
this
deck
i
ll
draw
it
here
go
he
cried
you
father
of
monkey
children
get
away
and
let
me
fight
you
fairly
or
by
my
honour
i
ll
stamp
the
inwards
out
of
you
and
make
your
silly
crew
wear
them
as
upon
which
dason
went
to
his
galley
promptly
tob
set
going
the
machine
on
our
own
bear
and
bawled
his
orders
right
and
left
to
the
other
ships
the
crew
might
be
weak
with
scurvy
but
they
were
quick
to
obey
instantly
the
five
vessels
were
all
started
and
because
our
lord
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
got
soon
to
the
full
of
their
pace
the
whole
of
our
small
navy
converged
singling
out
one
ship
of
their
opponents
and
she
not
being
ready
for
so
swift
an
attack
got
flurried
and
endeavoured
to
turn
and
run
for
room
instead
of
trying
to
meet
us
bows
on
as
a
consequence
the
whole
of
our
five
ships
hit
her
together
on
the
broadside
tearing
her
planking
with
their
underwater
beaks
and
sinking
her
before
we
had
backed
clear
from
the
engage
but
if
we
thus
brought
the
enemy
s
number
down
to
five
and
so
equal
to
our
own
the
advantage
did
not
remain
with
us
for
long
the
three
nimble
galleys
formed
into
line
their
boatswains
whips
cracked
as
the
slaves
bent
to
their
oars
and
presently
one
of
our
own
ships
was
gored
and
sunk
the
men
on
her
being
killed
in
the
water
without
hope
of
rescue
and
then
commenced
a
melee
that
would
have
warmed
the
heart
of
the
greatest
warrior
alive
the
ships
and
the
galleys
were
forced
together
and
lay
savagely
grinding
one
another
upon
the
swells
as
though
they
had
been
sentient
animals
the
men
on
board
them
shot
their
arrows
slashed
with
axes
thrust
and
hacked
with
swords
and
hurled
the
throwing
fire
but
in
every
way
the
fight
converged
upon
the
it
was
on
her
that
the
enemy
spent
the
fiercest
of
their
spite
it
was
to
the
bear
that
the
other
crews
of
tatho
s
navy
rallied
as
their
own
vessels
caught
fire
or
were
sunk
or
taken
battle
is
an
old
acquaintance
with
us
of
the
priestly
clan
and
for
those
of
us
who
have
had
to
carve
out
territories
for
the
new
colonies
it
comes
with
enough
frequency
to
cloy
even
the
most
chivalrous
appetite
so
i
can
speak
here
as
a
man
of
experience
up
till
that
time
for
half
a
i
had
heard
men
shout
deucalion
as
a
battlecry
and
in
my
day
had
seen
some
lusty
encounters
but
this
surprised
even
me
in
its
savage
fierceness
the
bleak
unstable
element
which
surrounded
us
the
swaying
decks
on
which
we
fought
the
throwing
fire
which
burnt
flesh
and
wood
alike
with
its
horrid
flame
the
great
gluttonous
birds
that
hovered
in
the
sky
overhead
the
fish
that
swarmed
up
from
the
seas
around
gnawing
and
quarrelling
over
those
that
fell
into
the
waters
all
went
to
make
up
a
circumstance
fit
to
daunt
the
bravest
ever
gathered
for
an
army
but
these
tarry
shipmen
faced
it
all
with
an
indomitable
courage
and
never
a
cry
of
quailing
life
on
the
seas
is
so
hard
and
from
the
beasts
that
haunt
the
great
waters
so
full
of
savage
dangers
that
death
has
lost
half
his
terrors
to
them
through
sheer
familiarity
they
were
fellows
who
from
pure
lust
for
a
fray
would
fight
to
a
finish
amongst
themselves
in
the
taverns
ashore
and
so
here
in
this
desperate
the
passion
for
killing
burned
in
them
as
a
fire
stone
from
heaven
rages
in
a
forest
and
they
took
even
their
laughing
on
our
side
the
was
tob
and
the
name
of
this
obscure
seemed
to
carry
a
confidence
with
it
for
our
own
crews
that
many
a
commander
might
have
envied
the
enemy
had
a
dozen
rallying
cries
and
these
confused
them
but
as
their
other
one
by
one
were
killed
and
dason
remained
active
with
mischief
dason
became
the
shout
which
was
thrown
back
at
us
in
response
to
our
tob
however
i
will
not
load
my
page
with
farther
long
account
of
this
obscure
whose
only
glory
was
its
ferocity
one
by
one
all
the
ships
of
either
side
were
sunk
or
lay
with
all
their
people
killed
till
finally
only
dason
s
galley
and
our
own
bear
were
left
for
the
moment
we
were
being
mastered
we
had
a
score
of
men
remaining
out
of
all
those
that
manned
the
navy
when
it
sailed
from
yucatan
and
the
enemy
had
boarded
us
and
made
the
decks
of
the
bear
the
field
of
battle
but
they
had
been
over
busy
with
the
throwing
fire
and
presently
as
we
raged
at
one
another
the
smoke
and
the
flame
from
the
sturdy
vessel
herself
let
us
very
plainly
know
that
she
was
past
salvation
but
tob
was
nothing
daunted
they
may
stay
here
and
fry
if
they
choose
he
shouted
with
his
great
boisterous
laugh
but
for
ourselves
the
galley
is
good
enough
now
keep
a
guard
on
deucalion
and
come
with
me
shipmates
tob
our
fellows
shouted
in
their
ecstasy
of
fighting
madness
and
i
too
could
not
forbear
sending
out
a
tob
for
my
it
was
a
change
for
me
not
to
be
leader
but
it
was
a
luxury
for
once
to
fight
in
the
wake
of
this
tob
despite
his
uncouthness
of
mien
and
plan
there
was
no
stopping
this
new
rush
though
progress
still
was
slow
tob
with
his
bloody
axe
cut
the
road
in
front
and
we
others
with
the
lust
of
battle
filling
us
to
the
chin
raged
like
furies
in
his
wake
gods
but
it
was
a
fight
ten
of
us
won
to
the
galley
with
the
flames
and
the
smoke
from
the
poor
bear
spurting
at
our
heels
we
turned
and
stabbed
madly
at
all
who
tried
to
follow
and
hacked
through
the
grapples
that
held
the
vessels
to
their
embrace
the
spurned
the
bear
away
the
slaves
chained
to
the
s
benches
had
interest
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
and
looked
on
the
contest
with
dull
concern
save
when
some
stray
missile
found
a
billet
amongst
them
but
a
handful
of
the
fighting
men
had
scrambled
desperately
on
board
the
galley
after
us
preferring
any
fate
to
a
fiery
death
on
the
bear
and
these
had
to
be
dealt
with
promptly
three
with
their
fighting
fury
still
in
them
had
most
wastefully
to
be
killed
out
of
mischief
s
way
five
who
had
pitched
their
weapons
into
the
sea
were
chained
to
oar
looms
in
place
of
slaves
who
were
dead
and
there
remained
only
dason
to
have
a
fate
apportioned
the
fight
had
cooled
out
of
him
and
he
had
thrown
his
arms
to
the
sea
and
stood
sullenly
ready
for
what
might
befall
and
to
him
tob
went
up
with
an
exulting
face
ho
dason
cried
he
you
made
a
lot
of
talk
an
hour
ago
about
that
woman
of
mine
who
lives
with
her
brats
on
the
in
atlantis
yonder
now
i
ll
give
you
a
pleasant
choice
either
i
ll
take
you
along
home
and
tell
her
what
you
said
before
the
whole
ship
s
company
that
are
for
the
most
part
dead
now
poor
souls
and
i
ll
leave
her
to
perform
on
your
carcase
as
she
sees
fit
by
way
of
payment
or
as
the
other
choice
i
ll
deal
with
you
here
now
i
thank
you
for
the
chance
said
dason
and
knelt
and
offered
his
neck
to
the
axe
so
tob
cut
off
his
head
sticking
it
on
the
galley
s
beak
as
an
advertisement
of
what
had
been
done
the
body
he
threw
over
the
side
and
one
of
the
great
birds
that
hovered
near
picked
it
up
and
flew
away
with
it
to
its
nest
amongst
the
crags
and
so
we
were
free
to
get
a
meal
of
the
fruits
and
the
fresh
meats
which
the
galley
offered
whilst
the
sent
the
galley
rushing
onwards
towards
the
capital
there
was
a
in
the
and
i
filled
a
horn
and
poured
some
out
at
tob
s
feet
in
salutation
my
man
i
said
you
have
shown
me
a
thanks
said
he
and
i
know
you
are
a
judge
twas
pretty
whilst
it
lasted
and
seeing
that
my
lads
were
for
the
most
i
will
say
they
fought
with
credit
i
have
lost
my
lord
tatho
s
navy
but
i
think
phorenice
will
see
me
righted
there
if
those
that
are
against
her
took
so
much
trouble
to
kill
my
lord
deucalion
before
he
could
come
to
her
aid
i
can
fancy
she
will
not
be
niggard
in
her
joy
when
i
put
deucalion
safe
if
somewhat
dented
and
on
the
the
gods
know
i
said
for
it
is
never
my
custom
to
discuss
policies
with
my
inferiors
even
though
etiquette
be
for
the
moment
loosened
as
ours
was
then
by
the
thrill
of
battle
the
gods
will
decide
what
is
best
for
you
tob
even
as
they
have
decided
that
it
is
best
that
i
should
go
on
to
the
sailor
held
a
horn
filled
from
the
in
his
hand
and
i
think
was
minded
to
pour
a
libation
at
my
feet
even
as
i
had
done
at
his
but
he
changed
his
mind
and
emptied
it
down
his
throat
instead
it
is
thirsty
work
this
fighting
he
said
and
that
drink
comes
very
i
put
my
hand
on
his
arm
tob
i
said
whether
i
step
into
power
again
or
whether
i
go
to
the
block
is
another
matter
which
the
gods
alone
know
but
hear
me
tell
you
now
that
if
a
chance
is
given
me
of
showing
my
gratitude
i
shall
not
forget
the
way
you
have
served
me
in
this
voyage
and
the
way
you
have
fought
this
tob
filled
another
brimming
horn
from
the
and
splashed
it
at
my
feet
that
s
good
enough
surety
for
me
he
said
that
my
woman
and
brats
never
want
from
this
day
onward
the
lord
deucalion
for
the
block
indeed
the
welcome
of
phorenice
now
i
can
say
it
with
all
truth
that
till
the
rival
navy
met
us
in
the
mouth
of
the
gulf
i
had
thought
little
enough
of
my
importance
as
a
recruit
for
the
empress
but
the
laying
in
wait
for
us
of
those
ships
and
the
wild
ferocity
with
which
they
fought
so
that
i
might
fall
into
their
hands
were
omens
which
the
blindest
could
not
fail
to
read
it
was
clear
that
i
was
expected
to
play
a
lusty
part
in
the
fortunes
of
the
nation
but
if
our
coming
had
been
watched
for
by
enemies
it
seemed
that
phorenice
also
had
her
scouts
and
these
saw
us
from
the
mountains
and
carried
news
to
the
capital
the
arm
of
the
sea
at
the
head
of
which
the
vast
city
of
atlantis
stands
varies
greatly
in
width
in
places
where
the
mountains
have
and
sent
their
liquid
contents
down
to
form
hard
stone
below
the
channel
has
barely
a
river
s
wideness
and
then
beyond
for
the
next
s
sail
it
will
widen
out
into
a
lake
with
the
sides
barely
visible
moreover
its
course
is
winding
and
so
a
runner
who
knows
his
way
across
the
flats
and
the
swamps
and
between
the
smoking
hills
which
lie
along
the
shore
and
did
not
get
overcome
by
or
water
or
wandering
beasts
could
carry
news
overland
from
seacoast
to
capital
far
speedier
than
even
the
most
shrewdly
whipped
of
galleys
could
ferry
it
along
the
water
of
course
there
were
heavy
risks
that
a
lone
traveller
would
not
make
a
safe
passage
by
this
land
route
if
he
were
bidden
to
sacrifice
all
precautions
to
speed
but
phorenice
was
no
niggard
with
her
couriers
she
sent
a
corps
of
twenty
to
the
headland
that
overlooks
the
to
the
straits
they
started
with
the
news
each
on
his
own
route
and
it
says
much
for
their
speed
and
cleverness
that
no
fewer
than
seven
of
these
agile
fellows
came
through
scathless
with
their
tidings
and
of
the
others
it
was
said
that
quite
three
were
known
to
have
survived
still
about
this
we
had
no
means
of
knowing
at
the
time
and
pushed
on
in
fancy
that
our
coming
was
quite
unheralded
the
slaves
on
the
galley
s
were
for
the
most
part
savages
from
europe
and
the
smell
of
them
was
so
offensive
that
the
voyage
lost
all
its
pleasures
and
as
moreover
the
wind
carried
with
it
an
infinite
abundance
of
small
grit
from
some
erupting
fire
mountain
we
were
anxious
to
linger
as
little
as
possible
besides
if
i
may
confess
to
such
a
thing
without
being
unduly
degraded
although
by
my
priestly
training
i
had
been
taught
stoicism
and
knew
that
all
the
future
was
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
i
was
frailly
human
still
to
have
a
very
vast
curiosity
as
to
what
would
be
the
form
of
my
own
reception
at
atlantis
i
could
imagine
myself
taken
a
formal
prisoner
on
landing
and
set
on
a
formal
trial
to
answer
for
my
cure
of
the
colony
of
yucatan
i
could
imagine
myself
stepping
ashore
unknown
and
unnoticed
and
after
a
due
lapse
being
sent
for
by
the
empress
to
take
up
new
duties
but
the
manner
of
my
real
welcome
was
a
thing
i
did
not
even
guess
at
we
came
in
sight
of
the
peak
of
the
sacred
mountain
with
its
glare
of
eternal
fires
which
stand
behind
the
city
one
morning
with
the
day
s
break
and
the
whips
of
the
boatswains
cracked
more
vehemently
so
that
those
offensive
slaves
should
give
the
galley
a
final
spurt
the
wind
was
adverse
and
no
sail
could
be
spread
but
under
oars
alone
we
made
a
pretty
pace
and
the
sides
of
the
sacred
mountain
grew
longer
and
presently
the
peaks
of
the
pyramids
in
the
city
the
towers
of
the
higher
buildings
began
to
show
themselves
as
though
they
floated
upon
the
gleaming
water
it
was
twenty
years
since
i
had
seen
atlantis
last
and
my
heart
glowed
with
the
thought
of
treading
again
upon
her
the
splendid
city
grew
out
of
the
sea
as
we
approached
and
to
every
throb
of
the
oars
the
shores
leaped
nearer
i
saw
the
temple
where
i
had
been
admitted
first
to
manhood
i
saw
the
pyramid
in
whose
heart
i
had
been
initiated
to
the
small
mysteries
and
then
as
the
lesser
objects
became
discernible
i
made
out
the
house
where
a
father
and
a
mother
had
reared
me
and
my
eyes
became
dim
as
the
memories
rose
we
drew
up
outside
the
white
walls
of
the
harbour
as
the
law
was
and
the
slaves
panted
and
sobbed
in
quietude
over
the
for
vessels
thus
stationed
there
is
generally
a
sufficiency
of
waiting
for
a
is
apt
to
be
so
uncertain
of
his
own
dignity
that
he
must
e
en
keep
folks
waiting
to
prove
it
to
them
but
here
for
us
it
might
have
been
that
the
s
boat
was
waiting
the
signal
was
sounded
from
the
two
castles
at
the
harbour
s
entrance
the
chain
which
hung
between
them
was
dropped
and
a
boat
shot
out
from
behind
the
walls
as
fast
as
oars
could
drive
her
she
raced
up
alongside
and
the
questions
were
put
that
should
be
dason
s
galley
it
was
said
tob
oh
i
saw
dason
s
head
on
your
beak
said
the
you
were
tatho
s
captain
and
am
still
tatho
s
fleet
was
sent
by
dason
and
his
friends
to
the
and
so
we
took
this
stinking
galley
to
finish
the
voyage
in
seeing
that
it
was
the
only
craft
left
the
was
roving
his
eye
over
the
group
of
us
who
stood
on
the
i
fear
me
captain
that
you
ll
have
but
a
dangerous
reception
i
do
not
see
my
lord
deucalion
or
does
he
come
with
some
other
navy
gods
captain
if
you
have
let
him
get
killed
whilst
under
your
charge
the
empress
will
have
the
skin
torn
slowly
off
you
what
with
phorenice
and
tatho
both
so
curious
for
his
welfare
said
tob
my
lord
deucalion
seems
but
a
dangerous
passenger
but
i
shall
save
my
hide
this
he
jerked
at
me
with
his
thumb
he
s
there
to
put
in
a
word
for
me
the
stared
for
a
moment
as
if
unbelieving
and
then
as
though
satisfied
made
obeisance
like
a
fellow
well
used
to
ceremonial
i
trust
my
lord
in
his
infinite
strength
will
pardon
my
sin
in
not
knowing
him
by
his
nobleness
before
but
truth
to
tell
i
had
looked
to
see
my
lord
more
suitably
pish
i
said
if
i
choose
to
dress
simply
i
can
not
object
to
being
mistaken
for
a
simple
man
it
is
not
my
pleasure
to
advertise
my
quality
by
the
gauds
on
my
garb
if
you
think
amends
are
due
to
me
i
pray
of
your
charity
that
this
inquisition
may
the
fellow
was
all
bows
and
obsequiousness
i
am
the
humblest
of
my
lord
s
servants
he
said
it
will
be
my
exceeding
honour
to
pilot
my
lord
s
galley
into
the
berth
appointed
in
the
boat
shot
ahead
and
our
swung
into
stroke
again
tob
watched
me
with
a
dry
smile
as
he
stood
directing
the
men
at
the
helms
well
i
said
humouring
his
whim
what
is
it
i
m
thinking
said
tob
that
my
lord
deucalion
will
remember
me
only
as
a
very
rude
fellow
when
he
steps
ashore
amongst
all
this
fine
you
don
t
think
said
i
anything
of
the
then
i
must
prove
my
refinement
said
tob
and
not
he
picked
up
my
hand
in
his
huge
hard
fist
and
pressed
it
by
the
gods
deucalion
you
may
be
a
great
prince
but
i
ve
only
known
you
as
a
man
you
re
the
finest
fighter
of
beasts
and
men
that
walks
this
world
and
i
love
you
for
it
that
of
yours
on
the
lizard
is
a
thing
the
singers
in
the
taverns
shall
make
chaunts
we
drew
rapidly
into
the
harbour
the
soldiers
in
the
entrance
castle
blowing
their
trumpets
in
welcome
as
we
passed
between
them
the
captain
of
the
port
had
run
up
my
banner
to
the
masthead
of
his
boat
having
been
provided
with
one
apparently
for
this
purpose
of
announcement
and
from
the
quays
across
the
vast
basin
of
the
harbour
there
presently
came
to
us
the
noises
of
musicians
and
the
pale
glow
of
welcoming
fires
dancing
under
the
sunlight
i
was
almost
awed
to
think
that
an
empress
of
atlantis
had
come
to
such
straits
as
to
feel
an
interest
like
this
in
any
mere
returning
subject
it
was
clear
that
nothing
was
to
be
done
by
halves
the
s
boat
led
and
we
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
our
galley
was
run
up
alongside
the
royal
quay
and
moored
to
its
posts
and
rings
of
gold
all
of
which
are
sacred
to
the
reigning
house
if
dason
could
only
have
foreseen
this
honour
said
tob
with
grisly
jest
i
m
sure
he
d
have
laid
in
a
silken
warp
to
make
fast
on
the
bollards
instead
of
mere
plebeian
hemp
i
m
sure
there
d
be
a
frown
on
dason
s
head
this
minute
if
the
sun
hadn
t
scorched
it
stiff
my
lord
deucalion
will
you
pick
your
way
with
niceness
over
this
common
ship
and
tread
on
the
genteel
carpet
they
ve
spread
for
you
on
the
quay
yonder
the
heard
tob
s
rude
banter
and
looked
up
with
a
face
of
horror
and
i
remembered
with
a
small
sigh
that
colonial
freedom
would
have
no
place
here
in
atlantis
once
more
i
must
prepare
myself
for
all
the
dignity
of
rank
and
make
ready
to
tread
the
formalities
of
vast
and
gorgeous
ceremonial
but
be
these
things
how
they
may
a
man
must
preserve
his
individuality
also
and
though
i
consented
to
enter
a
pavilion
of
crimson
cloth
specially
erected
to
shelter
me
till
the
empress
should
deign
to
arrive
there
my
complaisance
ended
again
the
matter
of
clothes
was
harped
upon
the
three
gorgeously
caparisoned
chamberlains
who
had
inducted
me
to
the
shelter
laid
before
me
changes
of
raiment
bedecked
with
every
imaginable
kind
of
frippery
and
would
have
me
transform
myself
into
a
popinjay
in
fashion
like
their
own
curtly
enough
i
refused
to
alter
my
garb
and
when
one
of
them
stammeringly
referred
to
the
empress
s
tastes
i
asked
him
with
plainness
if
he
had
got
any
definite
commands
on
this
paltry
matter
from
her
mightiness
of
course
he
had
to
confess
that
there
were
none
upon
which
i
retorted
that
phorenice
had
commanded
deucalion
the
man
to
attend
before
her
and
had
sent
no
word
of
her
pleasure
as
to
his
outer
casing
this
dress
i
said
suits
my
temper
well
it
shields
my
poor
body
from
the
heat
and
the
wind
and
moreover
it
is
clean
it
seems
to
me
sirs
i
added
that
your
interfering
savours
somewhat
of
an
with
one
accord
the
chamberlains
drew
their
swords
and
pushed
the
hilts
towards
me
it
would
be
a
favour
said
their
spokesman
if
the
great
lord
deucalion
would
take
his
vengeance
now
instead
of
delivering
us
to
the
tormentors
poof
i
said
the
matter
is
forgotten
you
make
too
much
of
a
nevertheless
their
action
gave
me
some
enlightenment
they
were
perfectly
in
earnest
in
offering
me
the
swords
and
i
recognised
that
this
was
a
different
atlantis
that
i
had
come
home
to
where
a
man
had
dread
of
the
torture
for
a
mere
difference
concerning
the
cut
of
a
coat
there
was
a
bath
in
the
pavilion
and
in
that
i
regaled
myself
gladly
though
there
was
some
paltry
scent
added
to
the
water
that
took
away
half
its
refreshing
power
and
then
i
set
myself
to
wait
with
all
outward
composure
and
placidity
the
chamberlains
were
too
to
break
into
my
calm
and
i
did
not
condescend
to
small
talk
so
there
we
remained
the
four
of
us
i
sitting
they
standing
with
our
lord
the
sun
smiting
heavily
on
the
scarlet
roof
of
the
pavilion
whilst
the
music
blared
and
the
welcoming
fires
dispersed
their
odours
from
the
great
paved
square
without
which
faced
upon
the
quay
it
has
been
said
that
the
great
should
always
collect
dignity
by
keeping
those
of
lesser
degree
waiting
their
pleasure
though
for
myself
i
must
say
i
have
always
thought
the
stratagem
paltry
and
beneath
me
phorenice
also
seemed
of
this
opinion
for
as
she
herself
told
me
later
at
the
moment
that
tob
s
galley
was
reported
as
having
its
flank
against
the
marble
of
the
royal
quay
at
that
precise
moment
did
she
start
out
from
the
palace
the
gorgeous
procession
was
already
marshalled
bedecked
and
waiting
only
for
its
chiefest
ornament
and
as
soon
as
she
had
mounted
to
her
steed
trumpets
gave
the
order
and
the
advance
began
sitting
in
the
doorway
of
the
pavilion
i
saw
the
soldiery
who
formed
the
head
of
this
vast
concourse
emerge
from
the
great
broad
street
where
it
left
the
houses
they
marched
straight
across
to
give
me
the
salute
and
then
ranged
themselves
on
the
farther
side
of
the
square
then
came
the
mariners
guild
then
more
soldiers
all
making
obeisance
in
their
turn
and
passing
on
to
make
room
for
others
following
were
the
merchants
the
tanners
the
and
all
the
other
acknowledged
guilds
deliberately
attired
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
might
make
a
pageant
and
whilst
most
walked
on
foot
there
were
some
who
proudly
rode
on
beasts
which
they
had
tamed
into
rendering
them
this
menial
service
but
presently
came
the
two
wonders
of
all
that
dazzling
spectacle
from
out
of
the
eclipse
of
the
houses
there
swung
into
the
open
no
less
a
beast
than
a
huge
bull
mammoth
the
sight
had
sufficient
surprise
in
it
almost
to
make
me
start
many
a
time
during
my
life
had
i
led
hunts
to
kill
the
mammoth
when
a
herd
of
them
had
raided
some
village
or
cornland
under
my
charge
i
had
seen
the
huge
brutes
in
the
wild
ground
shaggy
horrid
monstrous
more
fierce
than
even
the
or
the
most
dangerous
beast
of
all
that
fight
with
man
for
dominion
of
the
earth
save
only
for
a
few
of
the
greater
lizards
and
here
was
this
creature
a
giant
even
amongst
mammoths
yet
tame
as
any
slave
and
bearing
upon
its
back
a
great
of
gold
stamped
with
the
outstretched
hand
and
bedecked
with
silver
snakes
its
murderous
tusks
were
gilded
its
hairy
neck
was
garlanded
with
flowers
and
it
trod
on
in
the
procession
as
though
assisting
at
such
pageantry
was
the
beginning
and
end
of
its
existence
its
tameness
seemed
a
fitting
symbol
of
the
masterful
strength
of
this
new
ruler
of
atlantis
simultaneously
with
the
mammoth
there
came
into
sight
that
other
and
greater
wonder
the
mammoth
s
mistress
the
empress
phorenice
the
beast
took
my
eye
at
the
first
from
its
very
uncouth
hugeness
from
its
show
of
savage
power
restrained
but
the
lady
who
sat
in
the
golden
on
its
lofty
back
quickly
drew
away
my
gaze
and
held
it
immovable
from
then
onwards
with
an
infinite
attraction
i
stood
to
my
feet
when
the
people
first
shouted
at
phorenice
s
approach
and
remained
in
the
porchway
of
my
scarlet
pavilion
till
her
vast
steed
had
halted
in
the
centre
of
the
square
and
then
i
advanced
across
the
pavement
towards
her
on
your
knees
my
lord
said
one
of
the
chamberlains
behind
me
in
a
scared
whisper
at
least
with
bent
head
urged
another
but
i
had
my
own
notions
of
what
is
due
to
one
s
own
in
these
matters
and
i
marched
across
the
bare
open
space
with
head
erect
giving
the
empress
gaze
for
gaze
she
was
clearly
summing
me
up
i
was
frankly
doing
the
like
by
her
gods
but
those
few
short
seconds
made
me
see
a
woman
such
as
i
never
imagined
could
have
lived
i
know
i
have
placed
it
on
record
earlier
in
this
writing
that
during
all
the
days
of
a
long
official
life
women
have
had
no
influence
over
me
but
i
have
been
quick
to
see
that
they
often
had
a
strong
swaying
power
over
the
policies
of
others
and
as
a
consequence
i
have
made
it
my
business
to
study
them
even
as
i
have
studied
men
but
this
woman
who
sat
under
the
sacred
snakes
in
her
golden
on
the
mammoth
s
back
fairly
baffled
me
of
her
thoughts
i
could
read
no
single
syllable
i
could
see
a
body
slight
supple
and
beautifully
moulded
in
figure
rather
small
her
face
was
a
most
perfect
book
of
cleverness
yet
she
was
fair
too
beyond
belief
with
hair
of
a
lovely
ruddiness
cut
short
in
the
new
fashion
and
bunching
on
her
shoulders
and
eyes
gods
who
could
plumb
the
depths
of
phorenice
s
eyes
or
find
in
mere
tint
a
trace
of
their
colour
it
was
plain
also
that
she
in
her
turn
was
searching
me
down
to
my
very
soul
and
it
seemed
that
her
scrutiny
was
not
without
its
satisfaction
she
moved
her
head
in
little
nods
as
i
drew
near
and
when
i
did
the
requisite
obeisance
permitted
to
my
rank
she
bade
me
in
a
voice
loud
and
clear
enough
for
all
at
hand
to
hear
never
to
put
forehead
on
the
ground
again
on
her
behalf
so
long
as
she
ruled
in
atlantis
for
others
she
said
it
is
fitting
that
they
should
do
so
once
twice
or
several
times
according
to
their
rank
and
station
for
i
am
empress
and
they
are
all
so
far
beneath
me
but
you
are
deucalion
my
lord
and
though
till
i
knew
you
only
from
pictures
drawn
with
tongues
i
have
seen
you
now
and
have
judged
for
myself
and
so
i
make
this
decree
deucalion
is
above
all
other
men
in
atlantis
and
if
there
is
one
who
does
not
render
him
obedience
that
man
is
enemy
also
of
phorenice
and
shall
feel
her
she
made
a
sign
and
a
stair
was
brought
and
then
she
called
to
me
and
i
mounted
and
sat
beside
her
in
the
golden
under
the
canopy
of
royal
snakes
the
girl
who
stood
behind
in
attendance
fanned
us
both
with
perfumed
feathers
and
at
a
word
from
phorenice
the
mammoth
was
turned
bearing
us
back
towards
the
royal
pyramid
by
the
way
through
which
it
had
come
at
the
same
time
also
all
the
other
machinery
of
splendour
was
put
in
motion
the
soldiers
and
the
gaudily
bedecked
civil
traders
fell
into
procession
before
and
behind
and
i
noted
that
a
body
of
troops
heavily
armed
marched
on
each
of
the
mammoth
s
flanks
phorenice
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
you
piqued
me
she
said
at
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
with
so
much
you
looked
at
my
steed
before
you
looked
at
me
a
woman
finds
it
hard
to
forgive
a
slight
like
i
envied
you
the
greatest
of
your
conquests
and
do
still
i
have
fought
mammoths
myself
and
at
times
have
killed
but
i
never
dared
even
to
think
of
taking
one
alive
and
bringing
it
into
you
speak
boldly
she
said
still
smiling
and
yet
you
can
turn
a
pretty
compliment
faugh
deucalion
the
way
these
people
fawn
on
me
gives
me
a
nausea
i
am
not
of
the
same
clay
as
they
are
i
know
but
just
because
i
am
the
daughter
of
gods
they
must
needs
feed
me
on
the
pap
of
so
tatho
was
right
and
the
swineherd
was
forgotten
well
if
she
chose
to
keep
up
the
fiction
she
had
made
it
was
not
my
part
to
contradict
her
rightly
or
wrongly
i
was
her
servant
i
have
been
pining
this
long
enough
for
a
stronger
meat
than
they
can
give
she
went
on
and
at
last
i
have
sent
for
you
i
have
been
at
some
pains
to
procure
my
of
you
deucalion
and
though
you
do
not
know
me
yet
i
may
say
i
knew
you
with
all
thoroughness
even
before
we
met
i
can
admire
a
man
with
a
mind
great
enough
to
forego
the
silly
gauds
of
clothes
or
the
excesses
of
feasts
or
the
pamperings
of
she
looked
down
at
her
own
silks
and
her
glittering
jewels
we
women
like
to
carry
colours
upon
our
persons
but
that
is
a
different
matter
and
so
i
sent
for
you
here
to
be
my
minister
and
bear
with
me
the
burden
of
there
should
be
better
men
in
broad
there
are
not
my
lord
and
i
who
know
them
all
by
heart
tell
you
so
they
are
all
enamoured
of
my
poor
person
they
weary
me
with
their
empty
phrases
and
their
importunities
and
though
they
are
always
brimming
with
their
cries
of
service
their
own
advancement
and
the
filling
of
their
own
treasuries
ever
comes
first
with
them
so
i
have
sent
for
you
deucalion
the
one
strong
man
in
all
the
world
you
at
least
will
not
sigh
to
be
my
lover
i
saw
her
watching
for
my
answer
from
the
corner
of
her
eyes
the
empress
i
said
is
my
mistress
and
i
will
be
an
honest
minister
to
her
with
phorenice
the
woman
it
is
likely
that
i
shall
have
little
enough
to
do
besides
i
am
not
the
sort
that
sports
with
this
toy
they
call
and
yet
you
are
a
personable
man
enough
she
said
rather
thoughtfully
but
that
still
further
proves
your
strength
deucalion
you
at
least
will
not
lose
your
head
through
weak
infatuation
for
my
poor
looks
and
she
turned
to
the
girl
who
stood
behind
ylga
fan
not
so
our
talk
broke
off
then
for
the
moment
and
i
had
time
to
look
about
me
we
were
passing
through
the
chief
street
in
the
fairest
the
most
wonderful
city
this
world
has
ever
seen
i
had
left
it
a
score
of
years
before
and
was
curious
to
note
its
increase
in
public
buildings
the
city
had
certainly
made
growth
there
were
new
temples
new
pyramids
new
palaces
and
statuary
everywhere
its
greatness
and
magnificence
impressed
me
more
strongly
even
than
usual
returning
to
it
as
i
did
from
such
a
distance
of
time
and
space
for
though
the
many
cities
of
yucatan
might
each
of
them
be
princely
this
great
capital
was
a
place
not
to
be
compared
with
any
of
them
it
was
imperial
and
gorgeous
beyond
descriptive
words
yet
most
of
all
was
i
struck
by
the
poverty
and
squalor
which
stood
in
such
close
touch
with
all
this
magnificence
in
the
throngs
that
lined
the
streets
there
were
gaunt
bodies
and
hungry
faces
everywhere
here
and
there
stood
one
a
man
or
a
woman
as
naked
as
a
savage
in
europe
and
yet
dull
to
shame
even
the
trader
with
trumpery
gauds
on
his
coat
aping
the
prevailing
fashion
for
display
had
a
scared
uneasy
look
to
his
face
as
though
he
had
forgotten
the
mere
name
of
safety
and
hid
a
frantic
heart
with
his
tawdry
outward
vauntings
of
prosperity
phorenice
read
the
direction
of
my
looks
the
season
she
said
has
been
unhealthy
of
recent
months
these
lower
people
will
not
build
fine
houses
to
adorn
my
city
and
because
they
choose
to
live
on
in
their
squalid
unsightly
kennels
there
have
been
calentures
and
other
sicknesses
amongst
them
which
make
them
disinclined
for
work
and
then
too
for
the
moment
earning
is
not
easy
indeed
you
may
say
trade
is
nearly
stopped
this
last
since
the
rebels
have
been
hammering
so
lustily
at
my
city
i
was
fairly
startled
out
of
my
decorum
rebels
i
cried
who
are
hammering
at
the
gates
of
atlantis
is
the
city
in
a
state
of
siege
of
their
condescension
said
phorenice
lightly
they
are
giving
us
holiday
and
so
happily
my
welcome
to
you
comes
undisturbed
if
they
were
fighting
your
ears
would
have
told
you
of
it
to
give
them
their
due
they
are
noisy
enough
in
all
their
efforts
my
spies
say
they
are
making
ready
new
engines
for
use
against
the
walls
which
you
may
sally
out
and
break
if
it
gives
you
amusement
but
for
deucalion
i
have
you
and
you
have
me
and
there
is
peace
round
us
and
some
prettiness
of
display
if
you
ask
for
more
i
will
give
it
i
did
not
know
of
this
rebellion
i
said
but
as
your
majesty
has
made
me
your
minister
it
is
well
that
i
should
know
all
about
its
scope
at
once
this
is
a
matter
we
should
be
serious
and
do
you
think
i
can
not
take
it
seriously
also
she
retorted
ylga
she
said
to
the
girl
that
stood
behind
set
loose
my
dress
at
the
and
when
the
attendant
had
unlinked
the
jewelled
clasp
as
it
seemed
to
me
with
a
very
ill
grace
she
herself
stripped
down
the
fabric
baring
the
pure
skin
beneath
and
showing
me
just
below
the
curve
of
the
left
breast
a
bandage
of
bloodstained
linen
there
is
a
guarantee
of
my
seriousness
yesterday
at
any
rate
she
said
looking
at
me
sidelong
the
arrow
struck
on
a
rib
and
that
saved
me
if
it
had
struck
between
deucalion
would
have
been
standing
beside
my
funeral
pyre
instead
of
riding
on
this
pretty
steed
of
mine
which
he
admires
so
much
your
eye
seems
to
feast
itself
most
on
the
mammoth
deucalion
ah
poor
me
i
am
not
one
of
your
shaggy
creatures
and
so
it
seems
i
shall
never
be
able
to
catch
your
regard
ylga
she
said
to
the
girl
behind
you
may
link
my
dress
up
again
with
its
clasp
my
lord
deucalion
has
seen
wounds
before
and
there
is
nothing
else
here
to
interest
zaemon
s
curse
it
appeared
that
for
the
present
at
any
rate
i
was
to
have
my
residence
in
the
royal
pyramid
the
glittering
cavalcade
drew
up
in
the
great
paved
square
which
lies
before
the
building
and
massed
itself
in
groups
the
mammoth
was
halted
before
the
doorway
and
when
a
stair
had
been
brought
the
trumpets
sounded
and
we
three
who
had
ridden
in
the
golden
under
the
canopy
of
snakes
descended
to
the
ground
it
was
plain
that
we
were
going
from
beneath
the
open
sky
to
the
apartments
which
lay
inside
the
vast
stone
mazes
of
the
pyramid
and
without
thinking
the
instinct
of
custom
and
reverence
that
had
become
part
of
my
nature
caused
me
to
turn
to
where
the
towering
rocks
of
the
sacred
mountain
frowned
above
the
city
and
make
the
usual
obeisance
and
offer
up
in
silence
the
prescribed
prayer
i
say
i
did
this
thing
unthinking
and
as
a
matter
of
common
custom
but
when
i
rose
to
my
feet
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
a
titter
of
laughter
from
somewhere
in
that
fancifully
bedecked
crowd
of
onlookers
i
glanced
in
the
direction
of
the
scoffers
frowningly
enough
and
then
i
turned
to
phorenice
to
demand
their
prompt
punishment
for
the
disrespect
but
here
was
a
strange
thing
i
had
looked
to
see
her
in
the
act
and
article
of
rising
from
an
obeisance
but
there
she
was
standing
erect
and
had
clearly
never
touched
her
forehead
to
the
ground
moreover
she
was
regarding
me
with
a
queer
look
which
i
could
not
fathom
but
whatever
was
in
her
mind
she
had
no
plan
to
bawl
about
it
then
before
the
people
collected
in
the
square
she
said
to
me
come
and
turning
to
the
doorway
cried
for
entrance
giving
the
secret
word
appointed
for
the
day
the
ponderous
stone
blocks
which
barred
the
porch
swung
back
on
their
hinges
and
with
stately
tread
she
passed
out
of
the
hot
sunshine
into
the
cool
gloom
beyond
with
the
following
decorously
at
her
heels
with
a
heaviness
beginning
to
grow
at
my
heart
i
too
went
inside
the
pyramid
and
the
stone
doors
with
a
sullen
thud
closed
behind
us
we
did
not
go
far
just
then
phorenice
halted
in
the
hall
of
waiting
how
well
i
remembered
the
place
with
the
pictures
of
kings
on
its
red
walls
and
the
burning
fountain
of
which
blazed
from
a
jet
of
bronze
in
the
middle
of
the
flooring
and
gave
it
light
the
old
king
that
was
gone
had
come
this
far
of
his
complaisance
when
he
bade
me
farewell
as
i
set
out
twenty
years
before
for
my
in
yucatan
but
the
air
of
the
hall
was
different
to
what
it
had
been
in
those
old
days
then
it
was
pure
and
sweet
now
it
was
heavy
with
some
scent
and
i
found
it
languid
and
oppressive
my
minister
said
the
empress
i
acquit
you
of
intentional
insult
but
i
think
the
colonial
air
has
made
you
a
very
simple
man
such
an
obeisance
as
you
showed
to
that
mountain
not
a
minute
since
has
not
been
made
since
i
was
sent
to
reign
over
this
your
majesty
i
said
i
am
a
member
of
the
priests
clan
and
was
brought
up
in
their
tenets
i
have
been
taught
before
entering
a
house
to
thank
the
gods
and
more
especially
our
lord
the
sun
for
the
good
air
that
he
and
they
have
provided
it
has
been
my
fate
more
than
once
to
be
chased
by
streams
of
fire
and
stinking
air
amongst
the
mountains
during
one
of
their
sudden
boils
and
so
i
can
say
the
prescribed
prayer
upon
this
matter
straight
from
my
circumstances
have
changed
since
you
left
atlantis
said
phorenice
and
when
thanks
are
given
now
they
are
not
thrown
at
those
old
i
saw
her
meaning
and
almost
started
at
the
impiety
of
it
if
this
was
to
be
the
new
rule
of
things
i
would
have
no
hand
in
it
fate
might
deal
with
me
as
it
chose
to
serve
truly
a
reigning
monarch
that
i
was
prepared
for
but
to
palter
with
sacrilege
and
accept
a
swineherd
s
daughter
as
a
god
who
should
receive
prayers
and
obeisances
revolted
my
manhood
so
i
invited
a
crisis
phorenice
i
said
i
have
been
a
priest
from
my
childhood
up
revering
the
gods
and
growing
intimate
with
their
mysteries
till
i
find
for
myself
that
those
old
things
are
false
i
must
stand
by
that
allegiance
and
if
there
is
a
cost
for
this
faithfulness
i
must
pay
she
looked
at
me
with
a
slow
smile
you
are
a
strong
man
deucalion
she
said
i
bowed
i
have
heard
others
as
stubborn
she
said
but
they
were
she
shook
out
the
ruddy
bunches
of
her
hair
and
stood
so
that
the
light
of
the
burning
might
fall
on
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
form
i
have
found
it
as
easy
to
convert
the
stubborn
as
to
burn
them
indeed
there
has
been
little
talk
of
burning
they
have
all
rushed
to
conversion
whether
i
would
or
no
but
it
seems
that
my
poor
looks
and
tongue
are
wanting
in
charm
phorenice
is
empress
i
said
stolidly
and
i
am
her
servant
if
she
gives
me
leave
i
will
clear
away
this
rabble
which
clamours
outside
the
walls
i
must
begin
to
prove
my
i
am
told
you
are
a
pretty
fighter
said
she
well
i
hold
some
small
skill
in
arms
myself
and
have
a
conceit
that
i
am
something
of
a
judge
we
will
take
a
taste
of
battle
together
but
i
must
carry
through
the
honourable
reception
i
have
planned
for
you
deucalion
the
feast
will
be
set
ready
soon
and
you
will
wish
to
make
ready
for
the
feast
there
are
chambers
here
selected
for
your
use
and
stored
with
what
is
needful
ylga
will
show
you
their
we
waited
the
and
i
till
phorenice
had
passed
out
of
the
glow
of
the
and
had
left
the
hall
of
waiting
through
a
doorway
amongst
the
shadows
of
its
farther
angle
and
then
the
girl
taking
a
lamp
and
leading
we
also
threaded
our
way
through
the
narrow
mazes
of
the
pyramid
everywhere
the
air
was
full
of
perfumes
and
everywhere
the
passages
turned
and
twisted
and
doubled
through
the
solid
stone
of
the
pyramid
so
that
strangers
might
have
spent
hours
yes
or
days
in
search
before
they
came
to
the
chamber
they
desired
there
was
a
fine
cunningness
about
those
forgotten
builders
who
set
up
this
royal
pyramid
they
had
no
mind
that
kings
should
fall
by
the
hand
of
vulgar
assassins
who
might
come
in
suddenly
from
outside
and
it
is
said
also
that
the
king
of
the
time
to
make
doubly
sure
killed
all
that
had
built
the
pyramid
or
seen
even
the
lay
of
its
inner
stones
but
the
led
the
way
with
the
lamp
swinging
in
her
hand
as
one
accustomed
to
the
mazes
here
she
doubled
there
she
turned
and
here
she
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
blank
wall
to
push
a
stone
which
swung
to
let
us
pass
and
once
she
pressed
at
the
corner
of
a
flagstone
on
the
floor
which
reared
up
to
the
thrust
of
her
foot
and
showed
us
a
stair
steep
and
narrow
that
we
descended
coming
to
the
foot
of
an
inclined
way
which
led
us
upward
again
and
so
by
degrees
we
came
unto
the
chamber
which
had
been
given
for
my
use
there
is
raiment
in
all
these
chests
which
stand
by
the
walls
said
the
girl
and
jewels
and
gauds
in
that
bronze
coffer
they
are
phorenice
s
first
presents
she
bid
me
say
and
but
a
small
earnest
of
what
is
to
come
my
lord
deucalion
can
drop
his
simplicity
now
and
fig
himself
out
in
finery
to
suit
the
girl
i
said
sharply
be
more
decorous
with
your
tongue
and
spare
me
such
small
if
my
lord
deucalion
thinks
this
a
rudeness
he
can
give
a
word
to
phorenice
and
i
shall
be
whipped
if
he
asks
it
i
can
be
stripped
and
scourged
before
him
the
empress
will
do
much
for
deucalion
just
girl
i
said
you
are
nearer
to
that
whipping
than
you
think
i
have
got
a
name
she
retorted
looking
at
me
sullenly
from
under
her
black
brows
they
call
me
ylga
you
might
have
heard
that
as
we
rode
here
on
the
mammoth
had
you
not
been
so
wrapped
up
in
i
gazed
at
her
curiously
you
have
never
seen
me
before
i
said
and
the
first
words
you
utter
are
those
that
might
well
bring
trouble
to
yourself
there
is
some
object
in
all
she
went
and
pushed
to
the
massive
stone
that
swung
in
the
doorway
of
the
chamber
then
she
put
her
little
jewelled
fingers
on
my
garment
and
drew
me
carefully
away
from
the
airshaft
into
the
farther
corner
i
am
the
daughter
of
zaemon
she
said
whom
you
you
bring
me
some
message
from
him
how
could
i
he
lives
in
the
priests
dwellings
on
the
mountain
you
did
obeisance
to
i
have
not
put
eyes
on
him
these
two
years
but
when
i
saw
you
first
step
out
from
that
red
pavilion
they
had
pitched
at
the
harbour
side
i
i
felt
a
pity
for
you
deucalion
i
remembered
you
were
my
father
s
zaemon
s
friend
and
i
knew
what
phorenice
had
in
store
she
has
been
plotting
it
all
these
two
i
can
not
hear
words
against
the
and
yet
what
she
stamped
her
sandal
upon
the
stone
of
the
floor
you
must
be
a
very
blind
man
deucalion
or
a
very
daring
one
but
i
shall
not
interfere
further
at
least
not
now
still
i
shall
watch
and
if
at
any
time
you
seem
to
want
a
friend
i
will
try
and
serve
i
thank
you
for
your
you
seem
to
take
it
lightly
enough
why
sir
even
now
i
do
not
believe
you
know
my
power
any
more
than
you
guess
my
motive
you
may
be
first
man
in
this
kingdom
but
let
me
tell
you
i
rank
as
second
lady
and
remember
women
stand
high
in
atlantis
now
believe
me
my
friendship
is
a
commodity
that
has
been
sought
with
frequence
and
and
as
i
say
i
am
grateful
for
it
you
seem
to
think
little
enough
of
my
gratitude
ylga
but
credit
me
i
never
have
bestowed
it
on
a
woman
before
and
so
you
should
treasure
it
for
its
well
she
said
my
lord
there
is
an
education
before
she
left
me
then
showing
me
how
to
call
slaves
when
i
wished
for
their
help
and
for
a
full
minute
i
stood
wondering
at
the
words
i
had
spoken
to
her
who
was
the
daughter
of
zaemon
that
she
should
induce
me
to
change
the
habit
of
a
lifetime
the
slaves
came
at
my
bidding
and
showed
themselves
anxious
to
deck
me
with
a
thousand
foolishnesses
in
the
matter
of
robes
and
gauds
and
what
seemed
to
be
the
modern
fashion
of
their
class
holding
out
the
virtues
of
a
score
of
perfumes
and
unguents
their
manner
irritated
me
clean
i
was
already
and
shaved
my
hair
was
trim
and
my
robe
was
unsoiled
and
considering
these
pressing
attentions
of
theirs
something
of
an
impertinence
i
set
them
to
beat
one
another
as
a
punishment
promising
that
if
they
did
not
do
it
with
thoroughness
i
would
hand
them
on
to
the
brander
to
be
marked
with
stripes
which
would
endure
it
is
strange
but
a
common
menial
can
often
surpass
even
a
rebellious
general
in
power
of
ruffling
one
i
had
seen
many
strange
sights
that
day
and
undergone
many
new
sensations
but
of
all
the
things
which
came
to
my
notice
phorenice
s
manner
of
summoning
the
guests
to
her
feast
surprised
me
most
nay
it
did
more
it
shocked
me
profoundly
and
i
can
not
say
whether
amazement
at
her
profanity
or
wonder
at
her
power
was
for
the
moment
strongest
in
my
breast
i
sat
in
my
chamber
awaiting
the
summons
when
gradually
growing
out
of
nothing
a
sound
fell
upon
my
ear
which
increased
in
volume
with
infinitely
small
graduations
till
at
last
it
became
a
clanging
din
which
hurt
the
ear
with
its
fierceness
and
then
i
guessed
what
was
coming
the
whole
massive
fabric
of
the
pyramid
trembled
and
groaned
and
shook
as
though
it
had
been
merely
a
child
s
wooden
toy
brushed
about
by
a
strong
man
s
sandal
it
was
the
portent
served
out
yearly
by
the
chiefs
of
the
priests
clan
on
the
sacred
mountain
when
they
bade
all
the
world
take
count
of
their
sins
it
was
the
sacred
reminder
that
from
roaring
raging
fire
and
from
the
agony
of
monstrous
man
had
been
born
and
that
by
these
same
agencies
he
would
eventually
be
swallowed
up
he
and
the
sins
within
his
breast
and
here
the
empress
was
prostituting
its
solemnities
into
a
mere
call
to
gluttony
and
sign
for
ribald
laughter
and
sensuous
display
but
how
had
she
acquired
the
authority
to
do
this
thing
who
was
she
that
she
should
tamper
with
those
dimly
understood
powers
the
forces
that
dwell
within
the
liquid
heart
of
our
mother
earth
had
there
been
treachery
had
some
member
of
the
priests
clan
forgotten
his
sacred
vows
and
babbled
to
this
woman
matters
concerning
the
holy
mysteries
or
had
phorenice
discovered
a
key
to
these
mysteries
with
her
own
agile
brain
if
that
last
was
the
case
i
could
continue
to
serve
her
with
silent
conscience
though
she
might
be
none
of
my
making
at
least
she
was
empress
and
it
was
my
duty
to
give
her
obedience
but
if
she
had
suborned
some
weaker
member
of
the
clan
on
the
sacred
mount
that
would
be
a
different
matter
for
be
it
remembered
that
it
was
one
of
the
elements
of
our
constitution
to
preserve
our
secrets
and
mysteries
inviolate
and
to
pursue
with
undying
hatred
both
the
man
who
had
dared
to
betray
them
and
the
unhappy
recipient
of
his
confidence
it
was
with
very
undecided
feelings
then
that
i
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
and
bade
the
slaves
lead
me
through
the
windings
of
the
pyramid
to
the
great
the
scene
there
was
dazzling
the
majestic
chamber
with
its
marvellous
carvings
was
filled
with
a
company
decked
out
with
all
the
gauds
and
colours
that
fancy
could
conceive
little
recked
they
of
the
solemn
portent
which
had
summoned
them
to
the
meal
of
the
death
and
misery
that
stalked
openly
through
the
city
wards
without
of
the
rebels
which
lay
in
leaguer
beyond
the
walls
of
the
neglected
gods
and
their
clan
of
priests
on
the
sacred
mountain
they
were
all
gluttonous
for
the
passions
of
the
moment
it
was
their
fashion
and
conceit
to
look
at
nothing
beyond
flaming
jets
of
lit
the
great
hall
to
the
brightness
of
midday
and
when
i
stepped
out
upon
the
pavement
trumpets
blared
so
that
all
might
know
of
my
coming
but
there
was
no
roar
of
welcome
deucalion
they
lisped
with
mincing
voices
bowing
themselves
ridiculously
to
the
ground
so
that
all
their
ornaments
and
silks
might
jangle
and
swish
indeed
when
phorenice
herself
appeared
and
all
sent
up
their
cries
and
made
lawful
obeisance
there
was
the
same
artificiality
in
the
welcome
they
meant
well
enough
it
is
true
but
this
was
the
new
fashion
heartiness
had
come
to
be
accounted
a
barbarism
by
this
new
culture
a
pair
of
posturing
smirking
chamberlains
took
me
in
charge
and
ushered
me
with
their
flimsy
golden
wands
to
the
dais
at
the
farther
end
it
appeared
that
i
was
to
sit
on
phorenice
s
divan
and
eat
my
meat
out
of
her
dish
there
is
no
stint
to
the
honour
the
empress
puts
upon
me
i
said
as
i
knelt
down
and
took
my
seat
she
gave
me
one
of
her
queer
sidelong
looks
deucalion
may
have
more
beside
if
he
asks
for
it
prettily
he
may
have
what
all
the
other
men
in
the
known
world
have
sighed
for
and
what
none
of
them
will
ever
get
but
i
have
given
enough
of
my
own
accord
he
must
ask
me
warmly
for
those
further
i
ask
i
said
first
that
i
may
sweep
the
boundaries
clear
of
this
rabble
which
is
clamouring
against
the
city
pah
she
said
and
frowned
have
you
appetite
only
for
the
sterner
pleasures
of
life
my
good
deucalion
they
must
have
been
rustic
folk
in
that
colony
of
yours
well
you
shall
give
me
news
now
of
the
toothsomeness
of
this
dishes
and
goblets
were
placed
before
us
and
we
began
to
eat
though
i
had
little
enough
appetite
for
victual
so
broken
and
so
highly
spiced
but
if
this
finicking
cookery
and
these
luscious
wines
did
not
appeal
to
me
the
other
diners
in
that
gorgeous
hall
appreciated
it
all
to
the
full
they
sat
about
in
groups
on
the
pavement
beneath
the
like
a
tangle
of
rainbows
for
colour
and
according
to
the
new
custom
they
went
into
raptures
and
ecstasies
over
their
enjoyment
women
and
men
both
they
lingered
over
each
titillation
of
the
palate
as
though
it
were
a
caress
of
the
gods
phorenice
with
her
quick
bright
eyes
looked
on
and
occasionally
flung
one
or
another
a
few
words
between
her
talk
with
me
and
now
and
again
called
some
favoured
creature
up
to
receive
a
scrap
of
viand
from
the
royal
dish
this
the
honoured
one
would
eat
with
extravagant
gesture
or
as
happened
twice
would
put
it
away
in
the
folds
of
his
clothes
as
a
treasure
too
dear
to
be
profaned
by
human
lips
to
me
this
flattery
appeared
gross
and
disgustful
but
phorenice
through
use
perhaps
seemed
to
take
it
as
merely
her
due
there
was
one
had
to
suppose
a
weakness
in
her
somewhere
though
truly
to
the
outward
seeing
none
was
apparent
her
face
was
strong
enough
and
it
was
subtle
also
and
moreover
it
was
wondrous
comely
all
the
courtiers
in
the
raved
about
phorenice
s
face
and
the
other
beauties
of
her
body
and
limbs
and
though
not
given
to
appreciation
in
these
matters
i
could
not
but
see
that
here
at
least
they
had
a
groundwork
for
their
admiration
for
surely
the
gods
have
never
favoured
mortal
woman
more
highly
yet
lovely
though
she
might
be
for
myself
i
preferred
to
look
upon
ylga
the
girl
who
because
of
her
rank
was
privileged
to
sit
on
the
divan
behind
us
as
immediate
attendant
there
was
an
honesty
in
ylga
s
face
which
phorenice
s
lacked
they
did
not
eat
to
nutrify
their
bodies
these
feasters
in
the
of
the
royal
pyramid
but
they
all
ate
to
cloy
themselves
and
they
strutted
forth
new
usages
with
every
platter
and
bowl
that
the
slaves
brought
to
me
some
of
their
manners
were
closely
touching
on
disrespect
at
the
halfway
of
the
meal
a
gorgeous
popinjay
he
was
a
governor
of
an
driven
into
the
capital
by
a
rebellion
in
his
own
lands
this
gorgeous
fop
i
say
walked
up
between
the
groups
of
feasters
with
flushed
face
and
unsteady
gait
and
did
obeisance
before
the
divan
most
astounding
empress
cried
he
fairest
among
the
goddesses
queen
regnant
of
my
adoring
heart
hail
phorenice
with
a
smile
stretched
him
out
her
cup
i
looked
to
see
him
pour
respectful
libation
but
no
such
thing
he
set
the
drink
to
his
lips
and
drained
it
to
the
final
drop
may
all
your
troubles
he
cried
pass
from
you
as
easily
and
leave
as
pleasant
a
the
empress
turned
to
me
with
one
of
her
quick
looks
you
do
not
like
this
new
habit
to
which
i
replied
bluntly
enough
that
to
pour
out
liquor
at
a
person
s
feet
had
grown
through
custom
to
be
a
mark
of
respect
but
that
drinking
it
seemed
to
me
mere
which
might
be
practised
anywhere
you
still
keep
to
the
old
austere
teachings
she
said
our
newer
code
bids
us
enjoy
life
first
and
order
other
things
so
as
not
to
meddle
with
our
more
immediate
and
so
the
feast
went
on
the
guests
practising
their
gluttonies
and
their
absurdities
and
the
guards
standing
to
their
arms
round
the
circuit
of
the
walls
as
motionless
and
as
stern
as
the
statues
carven
in
the
white
stone
beyond
them
but
a
term
was
put
to
the
orgy
with
something
of
suddenness
there
was
a
stir
at
the
farther
doorway
of
the
and
a
clash
as
two
of
the
guards
joined
their
spears
across
the
entrance
but
the
man
they
tried
to
stop
or
perhaps
it
was
to
pin
passed
them
unharmed
and
walked
up
over
the
pavement
between
the
lights
and
the
groups
of
feasters
all
looked
round
at
him
a
few
threw
him
ribald
words
but
none
ventured
to
stop
his
progress
a
few
women
chiefly
i
could
see
shuddered
as
he
passed
them
by
as
though
a
wintry
chill
had
come
over
them
and
in
the
end
he
walked
up
and
stood
in
front
of
phorenice
s
divan
and
gazed
fixedly
on
her
but
without
making
obeisance
he
was
a
frail
old
man
with
white
hair
tumbling
on
his
shoulders
and
ragged
white
beard
the
mud
of
wayfaring
hung
in
clots
on
his
feet
and
legs
his
wizened
body
was
bare
save
for
a
single
cloth
wound
about
his
shoulders
and
his
loins
and
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
wand
with
the
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
glowing
at
its
tip
that
wand
went
to
show
his
caste
but
in
no
other
way
could
i
recognize
him
i
took
him
for
one
of
those
ascetics
of
the
priests
clan
who
had
forsworn
the
steady
nurtured
life
of
the
sacred
mountain
and
who
lived
out
in
the
dangerous
lands
amongst
the
burning
hills
where
there
is
daily
peril
from
falling
rocks
from
fire
streams
from
evil
vapours
from
sudden
fissuring
of
the
ground
and
from
other
movements
of
those
unstable
territories
and
from
the
greater
lizards
and
other
monstrous
beasts
which
haunt
them
these
keep
constant
in
the
memory
the
might
of
the
holy
gods
and
the
insecurity
of
this
frail
earth
on
which
we
have
our
and
so
the
sojourners
there
become
chastened
in
the
spirit
and
gain
power
over
mysteries
which
even
the
most
studious
and
learned
of
other
men
can
never
hope
to
attain
a
silence
filled
the
room
when
the
old
man
came
to
his
halt
and
phorenice
was
the
first
to
break
it
those
two
guards
she
said
in
her
clear
carrying
voice
who
held
the
door
are
not
equal
to
their
work
i
can
not
have
imperfect
servants
remove
the
soldiers
next
in
the
rank
lifted
their
spears
and
drove
them
home
and
the
two
fellows
who
had
admitted
the
old
man
fell
to
the
ground
one
shrieked
once
the
other
gave
no
sound
they
were
clever
thrusts
both
the
old
man
found
his
voice
thin
and
high
and
broken
another
crime
added
to
your
tally
phorenice
not
half
your
army
could
have
hindered
my
entrance
had
i
wished
to
come
and
let
me
tell
you
that
i
am
here
to
bring
you
your
last
warning
the
gods
have
shown
you
much
favour
they
gave
you
merit
by
which
you
could
rise
above
your
fellows
till
at
last
only
the
throne
stood
above
you
it
was
seen
good
by
those
on
the
sacred
mountain
to
let
you
have
this
last
ambition
and
sit
on
this
throne
that
has
as
long
and
honourably
been
filled
by
the
ancient
kings
of
the
empress
sat
back
on
the
divan
smiling
i
seemed
to
get
these
things
as
i
chose
and
in
spite
of
your
friends
teeth
i
may
owe
to
you
old
man
a
small
parcel
of
thanks
though
that
i
offered
to
repay
but
for
my
lords
the
priests
their
permission
was
of
small
enough
value
when
it
came
i
would
have
you
remember
that
i
was
as
firm
on
the
throne
of
atlantis
as
this
pyramid
stands
upon
its
base
when
your
priests
came
up
to
give
their
tottering
the
old
man
waved
aside
her
interruption
hear
me
out
he
said
i
am
here
with
no
trivial
message
there
is
nothing
paltry
about
the
threat
i
can
throw
at
you
phorenice
with
your
your
handling
of
troops
and
your
other
fiendish
clevernesses
you
may
not
be
easy
to
overthrow
by
mere
human
means
though
forsooth
these
poor
rebels
who
yap
against
your
city
walls
have
contrived
to
hold
their
ground
for
long
enough
now
it
may
be
that
you
are
becoming
enervated
i
do
not
know
it
may
be
that
you
are
too
wrapped
up
in
your
feastings
your
dressings
your
pomps
and
your
debaucheries
to
find
leisure
to
turn
to
the
art
of
war
it
may
be
that
the
man
s
spirit
has
gone
out
from
your
arm
and
brain
and
you
are
a
woman
once
more
weak
and
again
i
do
not
know
but
this
must
happen
you
must
undo
the
evil
you
have
done
you
must
give
bread
to
the
people
who
are
starving
even
if
you
take
it
from
these
gluttons
in
this
hall
you
must
restore
atlantis
to
the
state
in
which
it
was
entrusted
to
you
or
else
you
must
be
removed
it
can
not
be
permitted
that
the
country
should
sink
back
into
the
lawlessness
and
barbarism
from
which
its
ancient
kings
have
digged
it
you
hear
phorenice
now
give
me
true
speak
him
fair
oh
for
the
sake
of
your
fortune
speak
him
fair
came
ylga
s
voice
in
a
hurried
whisper
from
behind
us
but
the
empress
took
no
notice
of
it
she
leaned
forward
on
the
cushions
of
the
divan
with
a
knit
brow
do
you
dare
to
threaten
me
old
man
knowing
what
i
am
i
know
your
origin
he
said
gravely
as
well
as
you
know
it
yourself
as
for
my
daring
that
is
a
small
matter
he
need
be
but
a
timid
man
who
dares
to
say
words
that
the
high
gods
put
on
his
i
shall
rule
this
kingdom
as
i
choose
i
shall
brook
interference
from
no
creature
on
this
earth
or
beneath
it
or
in
the
sky
above
the
gods
have
chosen
me
to
be
their
regent
in
atlantis
and
they
do
not
depose
me
through
such
creatures
as
you
go
away
old
man
and
play
the
fanatic
in
another
court
it
is
well
that
i
have
an
ancient
kindliness
for
you
or
you
would
not
leave
this
place
now
indeed
you
are
lost
i
heard
ylga
murmur
from
behind
and
the
old
man
in
front
of
us
did
not
move
a
step
instead
he
lifted
up
the
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
and
launched
his
curse
your
blasphemy
gives
the
reply
i
asked
for
hear
me
now
make
declaration
of
war
on
behalf
of
those
against
whom
you
have
thrown
your
insults
you
shall
be
overthrown
and
sent
to
the
nether
gods
at
whatever
cost
the
land
shall
be
purged
of
you
and
yours
and
all
the
evil
that
has
been
done
to
it
whilst
you
have
sullied
the
throne
of
its
ancient
kings
you
will
not
amend
neither
will
you
yield
tamely
you
vaunt
that
you
sit
as
firm
on
your
throne
as
this
pyramid
reposes
on
its
base
see
how
little
you
know
of
what
the
future
carries
i
say
to
you
that
whilst
you
are
yet
empress
you
shall
see
this
royal
pyramid
which
you
have
polluted
with
your
debaucheries
torn
tier
from
tier
and
stone
from
stone
and
scattered
as
feathers
spread
before
a
you
may
wreck
the
pyramid
said
phorenice
contemptuously
i
myself
have
some
knowledge
of
the
earth
forces
as
i
have
shown
this
night
but
though
you
crumble
every
stone
above
us
now
and
grind
it
into
grit
and
dust
i
shall
still
be
empress
what
force
can
you
crazy
priests
bring
against
me
that
i
can
not
throw
back
and
destroy
we
have
a
weapon
that
was
forged
in
no
mortal
smithy
shrilled
the
old
man
whereof
the
key
is
now
lodged
in
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
but
that
weapon
can
be
used
only
as
a
last
resource
the
nature
of
it
even
is
too
awful
to
be
told
in
words
our
other
powers
will
be
launched
against
you
first
and
for
this
poor
country
s
sake
i
pray
that
they
may
cause
you
to
wince
yet
rest
assured
phorenice
that
we
shall
not
step
aside
once
we
have
put
a
hand
to
this
matter
we
shall
carry
it
through
even
though
the
cost
be
a
universal
burning
and
destruction
for
know
this
daughter
of
the
swineherd
it
is
agreed
amongst
the
most
high
gods
that
you
are
too
full
of
sin
to
continue
speak
him
fairly
ylga
urged
from
behind
he
has
a
power
at
which
you
can
not
even
the
empress
made
to
rise
but
ylga
clung
to
her
skirt
for
the
sake
of
your
fame
she
urged
for
the
sake
of
your
life
do
not
defy
but
phorenice
struck
her
fiercely
aside
and
faced
the
old
man
in
a
tumult
of
passion
you
dare
call
me
a
blasphemer
who
blaspheme
yourself
you
dare
cast
slurs
upon
my
birth
who
am
come
direct
from
the
most
high
heaven
old
man
your
craziness
protects
you
in
part
but
not
in
all
you
shall
be
whipped
do
you
hear
me
i
say
whipped
the
lean
flesh
shall
be
scourged
from
your
scraggy
bones
and
you
shall
totter
away
from
this
place
as
a
red
and
bleeding
example
for
those
who
would
dare
traduce
their
empress
here
some
of
you
i
say
take
that
man
and
let
him
be
whipped
where
he
her
cry
went
out
clearly
enough
but
not
a
soul
amongst
those
glittering
feasters
stirred
in
his
place
not
a
soldier
amongst
the
guards
stepped
from
his
rank
the
place
was
hung
in
a
terrible
silence
it
seemed
as
though
no
one
within
the
hall
dared
so
much
as
to
draw
a
breath
all
felt
that
the
very
air
was
big
with
fate
phorenice
with
her
head
crouched
forward
looked
from
one
group
to
another
her
face
was
working
have
i
no
true
servants
she
asked
amongst
all
you
pretty
still
no
one
moved
they
stood
or
sat
or
crouched
like
people
fascinated
for
myself
with
the
first
words
he
had
uttered
i
had
recognized
the
old
man
by
his
voice
it
was
zaemon
the
weak
governor
who
had
given
the
empress
her
first
step
towards
power
that
earnest
searcher
into
the
mysteries
who
knew
more
of
their
powers
and
more
about
the
hidden
forces
than
any
other
dweller
on
the
sacred
mountain
even
at
that
time
when
i
left
for
my
colony
and
now
during
his
strange
hermit
life
how
much
more
might
he
not
have
learned
i
was
torn
by
warring
duties
i
owed
much
to
the
priests
clan
by
reason
of
my
oath
and
membership
it
seemed
i
owed
no
less
to
phorenice
and
again
was
zaemon
the
truly
accredited
envoy
of
the
high
council
of
the
priests
of
the
sacred
mountain
and
was
the
empress
of
a
truth
deposed
by
the
high
gods
above
or
was
she
still
empress
and
still
the
commander
of
my
duty
i
could
not
tell
and
so
i
sat
in
my
seat
awaiting
what
the
event
would
sow
phorenice
s
fury
was
growing
do
i
stand
alone
here
she
cried
have
i
pampered
you
creatures
out
of
all
touch
with
gratitude
it
seems
that
at
last
i
want
a
new
chief
to
my
guards
ho
who
will
be
chief
of
the
guards
of
the
empress
there
was
a
shifting
of
eyes
a
hesitation
then
a
great
burly
form
strode
up
from
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
and
a
perceptible
shudder
went
up
from
all
the
others
as
they
watched
him
so
tarca
you
prefer
to
take
the
risks
and
remain
chief
of
the
guard
yourself
she
said
with
an
angry
scoff
truly
there
did
not
seem
to
be
many
thrusting
forward
to
strip
you
of
the
office
i
shall
have
a
fine
sorting
up
of
places
in
payment
for
this
night
s
work
but
for
the
present
tarca
do
your
the
man
came
up
obviously
timorous
he
was
a
solidly
made
fellow
but
not
altogether
unmartial
and
though
but
little
of
his
cheek
showed
above
his
decorated
beard
i
could
see
that
he
paled
as
he
came
near
to
the
priest
my
lord
he
said
quietly
i
must
ask
you
to
come
with
stand
aside
said
the
old
man
thrusting
out
the
symbol
in
front
of
him
i
could
see
his
eyes
gather
on
the
soldier
and
his
brows
knit
with
a
strain
of
will
tarca
saw
this
too
and
i
thought
he
would
have
fallen
but
with
an
effort
he
kept
his
manhood
and
doggedly
repeated
his
summons
i
must
obey
the
command
of
my
mistress
and
i
would
have
you
remember
my
lord
that
i
am
but
a
servant
you
must
come
with
me
to
the
i
warn
you
cried
the
old
man
stand
from
out
of
my
path
you
it
must
have
been
with
the
courage
of
desperation
that
the
soldier
dared
to
use
force
but
the
hand
he
stretched
out
dropped
limply
back
to
his
side
the
moment
it
touched
the
old
man
s
bare
shoulder
as
though
it
had
been
struck
by
some
shock
he
seemed
almost
to
have
expected
some
such
repulse
yet
when
he
picked
up
that
hand
with
the
other
and
looked
at
it
and
saw
its
whiteness
he
let
out
of
him
a
yell
like
a
wounded
beast
oh
gods
he
cried
not
that
spare
me
but
zaemon
was
glowering
at
him
still
a
twitching
seized
the
man
s
face
and
he
put
up
his
sound
hand
to
it
and
plucked
at
his
beard
which
was
curled
and
plaited
after
the
new
fashion
of
the
day
a
woman
standing
near
screamed
as
the
half
of
the
beard
came
off
in
his
fingers
beneath
was
silver
whiteness
over
half
his
face
zaemon
had
smitten
him
with
a
sudden
leprosy
that
was
past
cure
yet
the
punishment
was
not
ended
even
then
other
twitchings
took
him
on
other
parts
of
the
body
and
he
tore
off
his
armour
and
his
foppish
clothes
and
always
where
the
bare
flesh
showed
there
had
the
horrid
plague
written
its
white
mark
and
in
the
end
being
able
to
endure
no
more
the
man
fell
to
the
pavement
and
lay
there
writhing
zaemon
said
no
further
word
he
lifted
the
symbol
before
him
set
his
eyes
on
the
farther
door
of
the
and
walked
for
it
directly
all
those
in
his
path
shrinking
away
from
him
with
open
shudders
and
through
the
valves
of
the
door
he
passed
out
of
our
sight
still
wordless
still
unchecked
i
glanced
up
at
phorenice
the
loveliness
of
her
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
it
was
the
first
great
reverse
this
she
had
met
with
in
all
her
life
and
the
shock
of
it
and
the
vision
of
what
might
follow
after
dazed
her
alas
if
she
could
only
have
guessed
at
a
tenth
of
the
terrors
which
the
future
had
in
its
womb
atlantis
might
have
been
saved
even
then
the
biters
of
the
city
walls
here
then
was
the
manner
of
my
reception
back
in
the
capital
of
atlantis
and
some
first
glimpse
at
her
new
policies
i
freely
confess
to
my
own
inaction
and
limpness
but
it
was
all
deliberate
the
old
ties
of
duty
seemed
lost
or
at
least
merged
in
one
another
beforetime
to
serve
the
king
was
to
serve
the
clan
of
the
priests
from
which
he
had
been
chosen
and
whose
head
he
constituted
but
phorenice
was
and
appeared
to
be
a
rule
unto
herself
if
zaemon
was
to
be
trusted
he
was
the
mouthpiece
of
the
priests
and
their
clan
had
set
her
at
defiance
and
how
was
a
mere
honest
man
to
choose
on
the
instant
between
the
two
but
cold
argument
told
me
that
governments
were
set
up
for
the
good
of
the
country
at
large
and
i
said
to
myself
that
there
would
be
my
choice
i
must
find
out
which
rule
promised
best
of
atlantis
and
do
my
poor
best
to
prop
it
into
full
power
and
here
at
once
there
opened
up
another
path
in
the
maze
i
had
heard
some
considerable
talk
of
rebels
of
another
faction
of
atlanteans
who
whatever
their
faults
might
be
were
at
any
rate
strong
enough
to
beleaguer
the
capital
and
before
coming
to
any
final
decision
it
would
be
as
well
to
take
their
claims
in
balance
with
the
rest
so
on
the
night
of
that
very
same
day
on
which
i
had
just
my
foot
on
the
old
country
s
shores
i
set
out
to
glean
for
myself
tidings
on
the
matter
no
one
inside
the
royal
pyramid
gainsaid
me
the
banquet
had
ended
abruptly
with
the
terrible
scene
that
i
have
set
down
above
on
these
tablets
for
with
tarca
writhing
on
the
floor
and
thrusting
out
the
gruesome
scars
of
his
leprosy
even
the
most
gluttonous
had
little
enough
appetite
for
further
gorging
phorenice
glowered
on
the
feasters
for
a
while
longer
in
silent
fury
but
saying
no
further
word
and
then
her
eyes
turned
on
me
though
softened
somewhat
you
may
be
an
honest
man
deucalion
she
said
at
length
but
you
are
a
monstrous
cold
one
i
wonder
when
you
will
thaw
and
here
she
smiled
i
think
it
will
be
soon
but
for
now
i
bid
you
farewell
in
the
morning
we
will
take
this
country
by
the
shoulders
and
see
it
in
some
new
she
left
the
then
ylga
following
and
taking
precedence
of
my
rank
i
went
out
next
whilst
all
others
stood
and
made
salutation
but
i
halted
by
tarca
first
and
put
my
hand
on
his
unclean
flesh
you
are
an
unfortunate
man
i
said
but
i
can
admire
a
brave
soldier
if
relief
can
be
gained
for
your
plague
i
will
use
interest
to
procure
it
for
the
man
s
thanks
came
in
a
mumble
from
his
wrecked
mouth
and
some
of
those
near
shuddered
in
affected
disgust
i
turned
on
them
with
a
black
brow
your
charity
my
lords
seems
of
as
small
account
as
your
courage
you
affected
a
fine
disbelief
of
zaemon
s
sayings
and
a
simpering
contempt
for
his
priesthood
but
when
it
comes
to
laying
a
hand
on
him
you
show
a
discretion
which
in
the
old
days
we
should
have
called
by
an
ugly
name
i
had
rather
be
tarca
with
all
his
uncleanness
than
any
of
you
now
as
you
with
which
i
waited
coldly
till
they
gave
me
my
due
salutation
and
then
walked
out
of
the
without
offering
a
soul
another
glance
i
took
my
way
to
the
grand
gate
of
the
pyramid
called
for
the
officer
of
the
guard
and
demanded
exit
the
man
was
obsequious
enough
but
he
opened
with
some
demur
my
lord
s
attendants
have
not
yet
come
up
i
have
my
lord
knows
the
state
of
the
streets
i
did
twenty
years
back
i
shall
be
able
to
pick
my
my
lord
must
remember
that
the
city
is
beleaguered
the
fellow
persisted
the
people
are
hungry
they
prowl
in
bands
after
nightfall
and
i
make
no
question
that
my
lord
would
conquer
in
a
fight
against
whatever
odds
but
quite
right
i
covet
no
street
scuffle
lend
me
i
pray
you
a
sufficiency
of
men
you
will
know
best
what
are
needed
for
me
i
am
accustomed
to
a
city
with
quiet
a
score
of
sturdy
fellows
were
detailed
off
for
my
escort
and
with
them
in
a
double
file
on
either
hand
i
marched
out
from
the
close
perfumed
air
of
the
pyramid
into
the
cool
moonlight
of
the
city
it
was
my
purpose
to
make
a
tour
of
the
walls
and
to
find
out
somewhat
of
the
disposition
of
these
rebels
but
the
gods
saw
fit
to
give
me
another
education
first
the
city
as
i
saw
it
during
that
night
walk
was
no
longer
the
old
capital
that
i
had
known
the
just
accretion
of
the
ages
the
due
admixture
of
comfort
and
splendour
the
splendour
was
there
vastly
increased
whole
wards
had
been
swept
away
to
make
space
for
new
palaces
and
new
pyramids
of
the
wealthy
and
i
could
not
but
have
an
admiration
for
the
skill
and
the
brain
which
made
possible
such
splendid
monuments
and
indeed
gazing
at
them
there
under
the
silver
of
the
moonlight
i
could
almost
understand
the
emotions
of
the
europeans
and
other
barbarous
savages
which
cause
them
to
worship
all
such
great
buildings
as
gods
since
they
deem
them
too
wonderful
and
majestic
to
be
set
up
by
human
hands
unaided
still
if
it
was
easy
to
admire
it
was
simple
also
to
see
plain
advertisement
of
the
cost
at
which
these
great
works
had
been
reared
from
each
grant
of
ground
where
one
of
these
stately
piles
earned
silver
under
the
moon
a
hundred
families
had
been
evicted
and
left
to
harbour
as
they
pleased
in
the
open
and
as
a
consequence
now
every
niche
had
its
quota
of
sleepers
and
every
shadow
its
squad
of
fierce
wild
creatures
ready
to
rush
out
and
rob
or
slay
all
wayfarers
of
less
force
than
their
own
myself
i
am
no
pamperer
of
the
common
people
i
say
that
if
a
man
be
left
to
hunger
and
shiver
he
will
work
to
gain
him
food
and
raiment
and
if
not
why
then
he
can
die
and
the
state
is
well
rid
of
a
worthless
fellow
but
here
beside
us
as
we
marched
through
many
wards
were
marks
of
blind
oppression
starved
dead
bodies
with
the
bones
starting
through
the
lean
skin
sprawled
in
the
gutter
and
indeed
it
was
plain
that
save
for
the
favoured
few
the
people
of
the
great
capital
were
under
a
most
heavy
oppression
but
at
this
though
i
might
regret
it
abominably
i
could
make
no
strong
complaint
by
the
ancient
law
of
the
land
all
the
people
great
and
small
were
the
servants
of
the
king
to
be
put
without
question
to
what
purposes
he
chose
and
phorenice
stood
in
the
place
of
the
king
so
i
tried
to
think
no
treason
but
with
a
sigh
passed
on
keeping
my
eyes
above
the
miseries
and
the
squalors
of
the
roadway
and
sending
out
my
thoughts
to
the
stars
which
hung
in
the
purple
night
above
and
to
the
high
gods
which
dwelt
amongst
them
seeking
if
it
might
be
for
guidance
for
my
future
policies
and
so
in
time
the
windings
of
the
streets
brought
us
to
the
walls
and
coursing
beside
these
and
giving
fitting
answer
to
the
sentries
who
beat
their
drums
as
we
passed
we
came
in
time
to
that
great
gate
which
was
a
charge
to
the
captain
of
the
garrison
here
it
was
plain
there
was
some
special
commotion
a
noise
of
laughter
went
up
into
the
still
night
air
and
with
it
now
and
again
the
snarl
and
roar
of
a
great
beast
and
now
and
again
the
shriek
of
a
hurt
man
but
whatever
might
be
afoot
it
was
not
a
scene
to
come
upon
suddenly
the
entrance
gates
of
our
great
capital
were
designed
by
their
ancient
builders
to
be
no
less
strong
than
the
walls
themselves
four
pairs
of
valves
were
there
each
a
monstrous
block
of
stone
two
square
and
a
thick
and
the
wall
was
doubled
to
receive
them
enclosing
an
open
circus
between
its
two
parts
the
four
gates
themselves
were
set
one
at
the
inner
one
at
the
outer
side
of
each
of
these
walls
and
a
hidden
machinery
so
connected
them
that
of
each
set
one
could
not
open
till
the
other
was
closed
and
as
for
forcing
them
without
war
engines
one
might
as
foolishly
try
to
push
down
the
royal
pyramid
with
the
bare
hand
my
escort
made
outcry
with
the
horn
which
hung
from
the
wall
inviting
such
a
summons
and
a
warder
came
to
an
and
did
inspection
of
our
persons
and
business
his
survey
was
according
to
the
ancient
form
of
words
which
is
long
and
this
was
made
still
more
tedious
by
the
noise
from
within
which
ever
and
again
drowned
all
speech
between
us
entirely
but
at
last
the
formalities
had
been
duly
complied
with
and
he
shot
back
the
massive
bars
and
bolts
of
stone
and
threw
ajar
one
monstrous
stone
valve
of
the
door
into
the
chamber
within
a
chamber
made
from
the
thickness
of
the
wall
between
the
two
doors
i
and
my
fellows
crowded
and
then
the
warder
with
his
machines
pulled
to
the
valve
which
had
been
opened
and
came
to
me
again
through
the
press
of
my
escort
bowing
low
to
the
ground
i
have
no
vail
to
give
you
i
said
abruptly
get
on
with
your
duty
open
me
that
other
with
respect
my
lord
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
first
announce
my
lord
s
presence
there
is
a
baiting
going
forward
in
the
circus
and
the
tigers
are
as
yet
mere
savages
and
no
respecters
of
the
what
the
tigers
if
my
lord
will
permit
them
the
name
they
are
baiting
a
batch
of
prisoners
with
the
two
great
beasts
which
the
empress
whose
name
be
adored
has
sent
here
to
aid
us
keep
the
gate
but
if
my
lord
will
there
are
the
ward
rooms
leading
off
this
passage
and
the
galleries
which
run
out
from
them
commanding
the
circus
and
from
there
my
lord
can
see
the
sport
now
the
mere
lust
for
killing
excites
only
disgust
in
me
but
i
suspected
the
orders
of
the
empress
in
this
matter
and
had
a
curiosity
to
see
her
scheme
so
i
stepped
into
the
warder
s
lodge
and
on
into
the
galleries
which
commanded
the
circus
with
their
the
old
builders
of
the
place
had
intended
these
for
a
second
line
of
defence
for
supposing
the
outer
doors
all
forced
an
enemy
could
be
speedily
shot
down
in
the
circus
without
being
able
to
give
a
blow
in
return
and
so
would
only
march
into
a
but
as
a
on
a
spectacle
they
were
no
less
useful
the
circus
was
bright
lit
by
the
moonlight
and
the
air
which
came
in
to
me
from
it
was
acrid
with
the
reek
of
blood
there
was
no
sport
in
what
was
going
forward
as
i
said
it
was
mere
killing
and
the
sight
disgusted
me
i
am
no
prude
about
this
matter
give
a
prisoner
his
weapons
put
him
in
a
pit
with
beasts
of
reasonable
strength
and
let
him
fight
to
a
finish
if
you
choose
and
i
can
look
on
there
and
applaud
the
strokes
the
war
prisoner
being
a
prisoner
has
earned
death
by
natural
law
and
prefers
to
get
his
last
stroke
in
hot
blood
than
to
be
knocked
down
by
the
headsman
s
axe
and
it
is
any
brave
man
s
luxury
either
to
help
or
watch
a
lusty
fight
but
this
baiting
in
the
circus
between
the
gates
was
no
fair
battle
like
that
to
begin
with
the
beasts
were
no
fair
antagonists
for
single
men
in
fact
twenty
men
armed
might
well
have
fled
from
them
when
the
warder
said
tigers
i
supposed
he
meant
the
great
cats
of
the
woods
but
here
in
the
circus
i
saw
a
pair
of
the
most
terrific
of
all
the
land
beasts
the
great
tigers
of
the
caves
huge
monsters
of
such
ponderous
strength
that
in
hunger
they
will
oftentimes
drag
down
a
mammoth
if
they
can
find
him
away
from
his
herd
how
they
had
been
brought
captive
i
could
not
tell
hunter
of
beasts
though
i
had
been
for
all
my
days
i
take
no
shame
in
saying
that
i
always
approached
the
slaying
of
a
with
stratagem
and
infinite
caution
to
entrap
it
alive
and
bring
it
to
a
city
on
a
chain
was
beyond
my
most
daring
schemes
and
i
have
been
accredited
with
more
new
things
than
one
but
here
it
was
in
fact
and
i
saw
in
these
captive
beasts
a
new
certificate
for
phorenice
s
genius
the
purpose
of
these
two
was
plain
whilst
they
were
in
the
circus
and
loose
no
living
being
could
cross
from
one
gate
to
the
other
they
were
a
new
and
sturdy
addition
to
the
defences
of
the
capital
a
collar
of
bronze
was
round
the
throat
of
each
and
on
the
collar
was
a
massive
chain
which
led
to
the
wall
where
it
could
be
payed
out
or
hauled
in
by
means
of
a
windlass
in
one
of
the
hidden
galleries
so
that
at
ordinary
moments
the
two
huge
beasts
could
be
tethered
one
close
to
either
end
of
the
circus
as
the
litter
of
bones
and
other
messes
showed
leaving
free
between
the
two
sets
of
doors
but
when
i
stood
there
by
the
looking
down
into
the
moonlight
of
the
circus
these
chains
were
slackened
though
men
stood
by
the
windlass
of
each
and
the
great
striped
brutes
were
prowling
about
the
circus
with
the
links
clanking
and
chinking
in
their
wake
lying
stark
on
the
pavement
were
the
bodies
of
some
eight
men
dead
and
uneaten
and
though
the
stopped
their
prowlings
now
and
again
to
nuzzle
these
and
beat
them
about
with
playful
they
made
no
pretence
at
commencing
a
meal
it
was
clear
that
this
cruel
sport
had
grown
common
to
them
and
they
knew
there
were
other
victims
yet
to
be
added
to
the
tally
presently
sure
enough
as
i
watched
a
valve
of
the
farther
gate
swung
back
an
arm
s
length
and
a
prisoner
furiously
resisting
was
thrust
out
into
the
circus
he
fell
on
his
face
and
after
one
look
around
him
he
lay
resolutely
still
with
eyes
on
the
ground
passively
awaiting
his
fate
the
ponderous
stone
of
the
gate
clapped
to
in
its
place
the
turned
in
their
prowlings
and
a
chatter
of
wagers
ran
to
and
fro
amongst
the
watchers
behind
the
it
seemed
there
were
niceties
of
cruelty
in
this
wretched
game
there
was
a
sharp
clank
as
the
windlasses
were
manned
and
the
tethering
chains
were
drawn
in
by
perhaps
a
score
of
links
one
of
the
crouched
lashed
its
tail
and
launched
forth
on
a
terrific
spring
the
chain
tautened
the
massive
links
sang
to
the
strain
and
the
great
beast
gave
a
roar
which
shook
the
walls
it
had
missed
the
prone
man
by
a
hand
s
breadth
and
the
watchers
behind
the
shrieked
forth
their
delight
the
other
tiger
sprang
also
and
missed
and
again
there
were
shouts
of
pleasure
which
mingled
with
the
bellowing
voices
of
the
beasts
the
man
lay
motionless
in
his
form
one
more
cowardly
or
one
more
brave
might
have
run
from
death
or
faced
it
but
this
poor
prisoner
chose
the
middle
course
he
permitted
death
to
come
to
him
and
had
enough
of
doggedness
to
wait
for
it
without
stir
the
great
were
used
it
appeared
to
this
disgusting
sport
there
were
no
more
wild
springs
no
more
stubbings
at
the
end
of
the
massive
chains
they
lay
down
on
the
pavement
and
presently
began
to
purr
rolling
on
to
their
sides
and
rubbing
themselves
luxuriously
the
prisoner
still
lay
motionless
in
his
form
by
slow
degrees
the
monstrous
brutes
each
drew
to
the
end
of
its
chain
and
began
to
reach
at
the
man
with
forepaw
the
male
could
not
touch
him
the
female
could
just
reach
him
with
the
far
tip
of
a
claw
and
i
saw
a
red
scratch
start
up
in
the
bare
skin
of
his
side
at
every
stroke
but
still
the
prisoner
would
not
stir
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
must
slack
out
more
links
of
one
of
the
tigers
chains
or
let
the
vile
play
linger
into
mere
tediousness
but
i
had
more
to
learn
yet
the
male
tiger
either
taught
by
his
own
devilishness
or
by
those
brutes
that
were
his
keepers
had
still
another
ruse
in
store
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
turned
round
backing
against
the
chain
a
yell
of
applause
from
the
hidden
men
behind
the
told
that
they
knew
what
was
in
store
and
then
the
monstrous
beast
stretched
to
the
utmost
of
its
vast
length
kicked
sharply
with
one
hind
paw
i
heard
the
crunch
of
the
prisoner
s
ribs
as
the
pads
struck
him
and
at
that
same
moment
the
poor
wretch
s
body
was
spurned
away
by
the
blow
as
one
might
throw
a
fruit
with
the
hand
but
it
did
not
travel
far
it
was
clear
that
the
knew
this
manoeuvre
of
her
mate
s
she
caught
the
man
on
his
bound
nuzzling
over
him
for
a
minute
and
then
tossing
him
high
into
the
air
and
leaping
up
to
the
full
of
her
splendid
height
after
him
those
other
onlookers
thought
it
magnificent
their
gleeful
shouts
said
as
much
but
for
me
my
gorge
rose
at
the
sight
once
the
tigers
had
reached
him
the
man
had
been
killed
it
is
true
without
any
unnecessary
lingering
even
a
light
blow
from
those
terrific
paws
would
slay
the
strongest
man
living
but
to
see
the
two
toying
with
the
poor
body
was
an
insult
to
the
pride
of
our
race
however
i
was
not
there
to
preach
the
superiority
of
man
to
the
beasts
and
the
indecency
and
degradation
of
permitting
man
to
be
unduly
insulted
i
had
come
to
learn
for
myself
the
new
balance
of
things
in
the
kingdom
of
atlantis
and
so
i
stood
at
my
place
behind
the
with
a
still
face
and
presently
another
scene
in
this
ghastly
play
was
enacted
the
tired
of
their
sport
and
first
one
and
then
the
other
fell
once
more
to
prowling
over
the
littered
pavements
with
the
heavy
chains
scraping
and
chinking
in
their
wake
they
made
no
beginning
to
feast
on
the
bodies
provided
for
them
that
would
be
for
afterwards
in
the
present
the
fascination
of
slaughter
was
big
in
them
and
they
had
thought
that
it
would
be
indulged
further
it
seemed
that
they
knew
their
entertainers
again
the
windlass
clanked
and
the
tethering
chains
drew
the
great
beasts
clear
of
the
doorway
and
again
a
valve
of
the
farther
door
swung
ajar
and
another
prisoner
was
thrust
struggling
into
the
circus
a
sickness
seized
me
when
i
saw
that
this
was
a
woman
but
still
in
view
of
the
object
i
had
in
hand
i
made
no
interruption
it
was
not
that
i
had
never
seen
women
sent
to
death
before
a
general
who
has
done
his
fighting
must
in
his
day
have
killed
women
equally
with
men
yes
and
seen
them
earn
their
by
lusty
battling
yet
there
seemed
something
so
wanton
in
this
cruel
helpless
sacrifice
of
a
woman
prisoner
that
i
had
a
struggle
with
myself
to
avoid
interference
still
it
is
ever
the
case
that
the
individual
must
be
sacrificed
to
a
policy
and
so
as
i
say
i
watched
on
outwardly
cold
and
impassive
i
watched
too
i
confess
it
freely
with
a
quickening
heart
here
was
no
sullen
submissive
victim
like
the
last
she
may
have
been
more
cowardly
as
some
women
are
she
may
have
been
braver
as
many
women
have
shown
themselves
but
at
any
rate
it
was
clear
that
she
was
going
to
make
a
struggle
for
her
life
and
to
do
vicious
damage
it
might
be
before
she
yielded
it
up
the
watchers
behind
the
recognized
this
their
wagers
and
the
hum
of
their
appreciation
swept
loudly
round
the
ring
of
the
circus
they
stripped
their
prisoners
before
they
thrust
them
out
to
this
death
of
all
the
clothes
they
might
carry
for
clothes
have
a
value
and
so
the
woman
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
she
clapped
her
back
to
the
great
stone
door
by
which
she
had
entered
and
faced
fate
with
glowing
eye
gods
there
have
been
times
in
early
years
when
i
could
have
plucked
out
sword
and
jumped
down
and
fought
for
her
there
for
the
sheer
delight
of
such
a
battle
but
now
policy
restrained
me
the
individual
might
want
a
helping
hand
but
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
clear
that
atlantis
wanted
a
minister
also
and
before
these
great
needs
the
lesser
ones
perforce
must
perish
still
be
it
noted
that
if
i
did
not
jump
down
no
other
man
there
that
night
had
sufficient
manhood
remaining
to
venture
the
opportunity
my
heart
glowed
as
i
watched
her
she
picked
a
bone
from
the
litter
on
the
pavement
and
beat
off
its
head
by
blows
against
the
wall
then
with
her
teeth
she
fashioned
the
point
to
still
further
sharpness
i
could
see
her
teeth
glisten
white
in
the
moonrays
as
she
bit
with
them
the
huge
which
stood
as
high
as
her
head
as
they
walked
came
nearer
to
her
in
their
prowlings
yet
obviously
neglected
her
this
was
part
of
their
accustomed
scheme
of
torment
and
the
woman
knew
it
well
there
was
something
intolerable
in
their
noiseless
ceaseless
paddings
over
the
pavement
i
could
see
the
prisoner
s
breast
heave
as
she
watched
them
a
terror
such
as
that
would
have
made
many
a
victim
sick
and
helpless
but
this
one
was
bolder
than
i
had
thought
she
did
not
wait
for
a
spring
she
made
the
first
attack
herself
when
the
made
its
stroll
towards
her
and
was
in
the
act
of
turning
she
flung
herself
into
a
sudden
leap
striking
viciously
at
its
eye
with
her
sharpened
bone
a
roar
from
the
onlookers
acknowledged
the
stroke
the
s
eye
remained
undarkened
but
the
puny
weapon
had
dealt
it
a
smart
flesh
wound
and
with
a
great
bellow
of
surprise
and
pain
it
scampered
away
to
gain
space
for
a
rush
and
a
spring
but
the
woman
did
not
await
its
charge
with
a
shrill
scream
she
sped
forward
running
at
the
full
of
her
speed
across
the
moonlight
directly
towards
that
shadowed
part
of
the
encircling
wall
within
whose
thickness
i
had
my
gazing
place
and
then
throwing
every
tendon
of
her
body
into
the
spring
made
the
greatest
leap
that
surely
any
human
being
ever
accomplished
even
when
spurred
on
by
the
utmost
of
terror
and
desperation
in
an
after
day
i
measured
it
and
though
of
a
certainty
she
must
have
added
much
to
the
tally
by
the
sheer
force
of
her
run
which
drove
her
clinging
up
the
rough
surface
of
the
wall
it
is
a
sure
thing
that
in
that
splendid
leap
her
feet
must
have
dangled
a
and
a
half
above
the
pavement
i
say
it
was
prodigious
but
then
the
spur
was
more
than
the
ordinary
and
the
woman
herself
was
far
out
of
the
common
both
in
thews
and
intelligence
and
the
end
of
the
leap
left
her
with
five
fingers
lodged
in
the
sill
of
the
from
which
i
watched
even
then
she
must
have
slipped
back
if
she
had
been
left
to
herself
for
the
sill
sloped
and
the
stone
was
finely
smooth
but
i
shot
out
my
hand
and
gripped
hers
by
the
wrist
and
instantly
she
clambered
up
with
both
knees
on
the
sills
and
her
fingers
twined
round
to
grip
my
wrist
in
her
turn
and
now
you
will
suppose
she
gushed
out
prayers
and
promises
thinking
only
of
safety
and
enlargement
there
was
nothing
of
this
with
savage
panting
wordlessness
she
took
fresh
grip
on
the
sharpened
bone
with
her
spare
hand
and
lunged
with
it
desperately
through
the
with
the
hand
that
clutched
mine
she
drew
me
towards
her
so
as
to
give
the
blows
the
surer
chance
and
so
unprepared
was
i
for
such
an
attack
and
with
such
fierce
suddenness
did
she
deliver
it
that
the
first
blow
was
near
giving
me
my
quietus
but
i
grappled
with
the
poor
frantic
creature
as
gently
as
might
be
the
stone
of
the
wall
separating
us
always
and
stripped
her
of
her
weapon
and
held
her
firmly
captive
till
she
might
calm
herself
that
was
an
ungrateful
blow
i
said
but
for
my
hand
you
d
have
slipped
and
be
the
sport
of
a
tiger
s
paw
this
oh
i
must
kill
some
one
she
panted
before
i
am
killed
there
will
be
time
enough
to
think
upon
that
some
other
day
but
for
now
you
are
far
enough
off
meeting
further
you
are
lying
to
me
you
will
throw
me
to
the
beasts
as
soon
as
i
loose
my
grip
i
know
your
kind
you
will
not
be
robbed
of
your
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
prove
myself
to
you
said
i
and
called
out
for
the
warder
who
had
tended
the
doors
below
bid
those
tigers
be
tethered
on
a
shorter
chain
i
ordered
and
then
go
yourself
outside
into
the
circus
and
help
this
lady
delicately
to
the
the
word
was
passed
and
these
things
were
done
and
i
too
came
out
into
the
circus
and
joined
the
woman
who
stood
waiting
under
the
moonlight
but
the
others
who
had
seen
these
doings
were
by
no
means
suited
at
the
change
of
plan
one
of
the
great
stone
valves
of
the
farther
door
opened
hurriedly
and
a
man
strode
out
armed
and
flushed
by
all
the
gods
he
shouted
who
comes
between
me
and
my
pastime
i
stepped
quietly
to
the
advance
i
fear
sir
i
said
that
you
must
launch
your
anger
against
me
by
accident
i
gave
that
woman
sanctuary
and
i
had
not
heart
to
toss
her
back
to
your
his
fingers
began
to
snap
against
his
hilt
you
have
come
to
the
wrong
market
here
with
your
qualms
i
am
captain
here
and
my
word
carries
subject
only
to
phorenice
s
nod
do
you
hear
that
do
you
know
too
that
i
can
have
you
tossed
to
those
striped
of
mine
for
meddling
in
here
without
an
invitation
he
looked
at
me
sharp
enough
but
saw
plainly
that
i
was
a
stranger
but
perhaps
you
carry
a
name
my
man
which
warrants
your
impertinence
deucalion
is
my
poor
name
i
said
but
i
can
not
expect
you
will
know
it
i
am
but
newly
landed
here
sir
and
when
i
left
atlantis
some
score
of
years
back
a
very
different
man
to
you
held
guard
over
these
he
had
his
forehead
on
my
feet
by
this
time
i
had
it
from
the
empress
this
night
that
she
will
make
a
new
sorting
of
this
kingdom
s
dignities
perhaps
there
is
some
recommendation
you
would
wish
me
to
lay
before
her
in
return
for
your
courtesies
my
lord
said
the
man
if
you
wish
it
i
can
have
a
turn
with
those
myself
now
and
you
can
look
on
from
behind
the
walls
and
see
them
tear
why
tell
me
what
is
no
news
i
wish
to
remind
my
lord
of
his
power
i
wish
to
beg
of
his
you
showed
your
power
to
these
poor
prisoners
but
from
what
remains
here
to
be
seen
few
of
them
have
tasted
much
of
your
the
orders
were
said
the
captain
of
the
gate
as
though
he
thought
a
word
might
be
said
here
for
his
defence
the
orders
were
my
lord
that
the
tigers
should
be
kept
fierce
and
accustomed
to
then
if
you
have
obeyed
orders
let
me
be
the
last
to
chide
you
but
it
is
my
pleasure
that
this
woman
be
respited
and
i
wish
now
to
question
the
man
got
to
his
feet
again
with
obvious
relief
though
still
bowing
low
then
if
my
lord
will
honour
me
by
sitting
in
my
room
that
overlooks
the
outer
gate
the
favour
will
never
be
show
the
way
i
said
and
took
the
woman
by
the
fingers
leading
her
gently
at
the
two
ends
of
the
circus
the
tigers
prowled
about
on
short
chains
growling
and
muttering
we
passed
through
the
door
into
the
thickness
of
the
outer
wall
and
the
captain
of
the
gate
led
us
into
his
private
chamber
a
snug
enough
box
overlooking
the
plain
beyond
the
city
he
lit
a
torch
from
his
lamp
and
thrust
it
into
a
bracket
on
the
wall
and
bowing
deeply
and
walking
backwards
left
us
alone
closing
the
door
in
place
behind
him
he
was
an
industrious
fellow
this
captain
to
judge
from
the
spoil
with
which
his
chamber
was
packed
there
could
have
come
very
few
traders
in
through
that
gate
below
without
his
levying
a
private
tribute
and
so
judging
that
most
of
his
goods
had
been
unlawfully
come
by
i
had
little
qualm
at
making
a
selection
it
was
not
decent
that
the
woman
being
an
atlantean
should
go
bereft
of
the
dignity
of
clothes
as
though
she
were
a
mere
savage
from
europe
and
so
i
sought
about
amongst
the
captain
s
spoil
for
garments
that
would
be
befitting
but
as
i
busied
myself
in
this
search
for
raiment
rummaging
amongst
the
heaps
and
bales
with
a
hand
and
eye
little
skilled
in
such
business
i
heard
a
sound
behind
which
caused
me
to
turn
my
head
and
there
was
the
woman
with
a
dagger
she
had
picked
from
the
floor
in
the
act
of
drawing
it
from
the
sheath
she
caught
my
eye
and
drew
the
weapon
clear
but
seeing
that
i
made
no
advance
towards
her
or
move
to
protect
myself
waited
where
she
was
and
presently
was
took
with
a
shuddering
your
designs
seem
somewhat
of
a
riddle
i
said
at
first
you
wished
to
kill
me
from
motives
which
you
explained
and
which
i
quite
understood
it
lay
in
my
power
next
to
confer
some
small
benefit
upon
you
in
consequence
of
which
you
are
here
and
not
shall
we
say
yonder
in
the
circus
why
you
should
desire
now
to
kill
the
only
man
here
who
can
set
you
completely
free
and
beyond
these
walls
is
a
thing
it
would
gratify
me
much
to
learn
i
say
nothing
of
the
trifle
of
ingratitude
gratitude
and
ingratitude
are
of
little
weight
here
there
is
some
far
greater
in
your
she
pressed
a
hand
hard
against
her
breasts
you
are
deucalion
she
gasped
i
heard
you
say
i
am
deucalion
so
far
i
have
known
no
reason
to
feel
shame
for
my
and
i
come
of
those
she
cried
with
a
rising
voice
who
bite
against
this
city
because
they
have
found
their
fate
too
intolerable
with
the
land
as
it
is
ordered
now
we
heard
of
your
coming
from
yucatan
it
was
we
who
sent
the
fleet
to
take
you
at
the
entrance
to
the
your
fleet
gave
us
a
pretty
oh
i
know
i
know
we
had
our
watchers
on
the
high
land
who
brought
us
the
tidings
we
had
an
omen
even
before
that
where
we
lay
with
our
army
before
the
walls
here
we
saw
great
birds
carrying
off
the
slain
to
the
mountains
but
where
the
fleet
failed
i
saw
a
chance
where
i
a
woman
might
where
you
might
succeed
i
sat
me
down
on
a
pile
of
the
captain
s
stuffs
it
seemed
as
if
here
at
last
that
i
should
find
a
solution
for
many
things
you
carry
a
name
i
asked
they
call
me
ah
i
said
and
signed
to
her
to
take
the
clothes
that
i
had
sought
out
she
was
curiously
like
so
both
my
eyes
and
hearing
said
to
ylga
the
of
phorenice
but
as
she
had
told
me
of
no
parentage
i
asked
for
none
then
still
her
talk
alone
let
me
know
that
she
was
bred
of
none
of
the
common
people
and
i
made
up
my
mind
towards
definite
understanding
nais
i
said
you
wish
to
kill
me
at
the
same
time
i
have
no
doubt
you
wish
to
live
on
yourself
if
only
to
get
credit
from
your
people
for
what
you
have
done
so
here
i
will
make
a
contract
with
you
prove
to
me
that
my
death
is
for
atlantis
good
and
i
swear
by
our
lord
the
sun
to
go
out
with
you
beyond
the
walls
where
you
can
stab
me
and
then
get
you
gone
or
the
i
will
not
be
your
i
do
not
ask
you
for
service
or
else
i
wished
to
say
i
shall
live
so
long
as
the
high
gods
wish
and
do
my
poor
best
for
this
country
and
for
you
i
shall
set
you
free
to
do
your
best
also
so
now
i
pray
you
the
biters
of
the
walls
further
account
you
will
set
me
free
she
said
regarding
me
from
under
her
brows
without
any
further
exactions
or
treaty
i
will
set
you
free
exactly
on
those
terms
i
answered
unless
indeed
we
here
decide
that
it
is
better
for
atlantis
that
i
should
die
in
which
case
the
freedom
will
be
of
your
own
my
lord
plays
a
bold
tut
tut
i
said
but
i
shall
not
hesitate
to
take
the
full
of
my
bond
unless
my
theories
are
most
clearly
disproved
to
tut
i
said
you
women
how
you
can
play
out
the
time
needlessly
show
me
sufficient
cause
and
you
shall
kill
me
where
and
how
you
please
come
begin
the
you
are
a
at
least
i
have
not
paraded
my
tyrannies
in
atlantis
these
twenty
years
why
nais
i
did
but
land
you
will
not
deny
you
came
back
from
yucatan
for
a
i
came
back
because
i
was
sent
for
the
empress
gives
no
reasons
for
her
recalls
she
states
her
will
and
we
who
serve
her
obey
without
pah
i
know
that
old
if
you
discredit
my
poor
honesty
at
the
outset
like
this
i
fear
we
shall
not
get
far
with
our
my
lord
must
be
indeed
simple
said
this
strange
woman
scornfully
if
he
is
ignorant
of
what
all
atlantis
then
simple
you
must
write
me
down
over
yonder
in
yucatan
we
were
too
well
wrapped
up
in
our
own
parochial
needs
and
policies
to
have
leisure
to
ponder
much
over
the
slim
news
which
drifted
out
to
us
from
atlantis
and
in
truth
little
enough
came
by
example
phorenice
whose
office
be
adored
is
a
great
personage
here
at
home
but
over
there
in
the
colony
we
barely
knew
so
much
as
her
name
here
since
i
have
been
ashore
i
have
seen
many
new
wonders
i
have
been
carried
by
a
riding
mammoth
i
have
sat
at
a
banquet
but
in
what
new
policies
there
are
afoot
i
have
yet
to
be
then
if
truly
you
do
not
know
it
let
me
repeat
to
you
the
common
tale
phorenice
has
tired
of
her
unmated
stay
there
i
will
hear
no
word
against
the
pah
my
lord
your
scruples
are
most
decorous
but
i
did
no
more
than
repeat
what
the
empress
had
made
public
by
proclamation
she
is
minded
to
take
to
herself
a
husband
and
nothing
short
of
the
best
is
good
enough
for
phorenice
one
after
another
has
been
put
up
in
turn
as
favourite
and
been
found
wanting
oh
i
tell
you
we
here
in
atlantis
have
watched
her
courtship
with
jumping
hearts
first
it
was
this
one
here
then
it
was
that
one
there
now
it
was
this
general
just
returned
from
a
victory
and
a
day
later
he
had
been
packed
back
to
his
camp
to
give
place
to
some
dashing
governor
who
had
squeezed
increased
revenues
from
his
province
but
every
ship
that
came
from
the
west
said
that
there
was
a
stronger
man
than
any
of
these
in
yucatan
and
at
last
the
empress
changed
the
wording
of
her
vow
i
ll
have
deucalion
for
my
husband
said
she
and
then
we
will
see
who
can
stand
against
my
the
empress
whose
name
be
adored
can
do
as
she
pleases
in
such
matters
i
said
guardedly
but
that
is
beside
the
argument
i
am
here
to
know
how
it
would
be
better
for
atlantis
that
i
should
die
you
know
you
are
the
strongest
man
in
the
it
pleases
you
to
say
and
phorenice
is
the
strongest
that
is
beyond
why
then
if
the
empress
takes
you
in
marriage
we
shall
be
under
a
double
tyranny
and
her
rule
alone
is
more
cruelly
heavy
than
we
can
bear
i
pass
no
criticism
on
phorenice
s
rule
i
have
not
seen
it
but
i
crave
your
mercy
nais
on
the
newcomer
into
this
kingdom
i
am
strong
say
you
and
therefore
i
am
a
tyrant
say
you
now
to
me
this
sequence
is
who
should
a
strong
man
use
strength
for
if
not
for
himself
and
if
for
himself
why
that
spells
tyranny
you
will
get
all
your
heart
s
desires
my
lord
and
you
will
forget
that
many
a
thousand
of
the
common
people
will
have
to
pay
for
and
this
is
all
your
accusation
it
seems
to
be
black
enough
i
am
one
that
has
a
compassion
for
my
my
lord
and
because
of
that
compassion
you
see
me
what
i
am
there
was
a
time
not
long
passed
when
i
slept
as
soft
and
ate
as
dainty
as
any
in
i
smiled
your
speech
told
me
that
much
from
the
then
i
would
i
had
cast
the
speech
off
too
if
that
is
also
a
livery
of
the
tyrant
s
class
but
i
tell
you
i
saw
all
the
oppression
myself
from
the
oppressor
s
side
i
was
high
in
phorenice
s
favour
that
too
is
easy
of
credence
ylga
is
the
to
the
empress
now
and
second
lady
in
the
kingdom
and
those
who
have
seen
ylga
could
make
an
easy
guess
at
the
parentage
of
we
were
the
daughters
of
one
birth
but
i
do
not
count
with
either
zaemon
or
ylga
now
ylga
is
the
creature
of
phorenice
and
phorenice
would
have
all
the
people
of
atlantis
slaves
and
in
chains
so
that
she
might
crush
them
the
easier
and
as
for
zaemon
he
is
no
friend
of
phorenice
s
he
fights
with
brain
and
soul
to
drag
the
old
authority
to
those
on
the
sacred
mountain
and
that
if
it
come
down
on
us
again
would
only
be
the
exchange
of
one
form
of
slavery
for
it
seems
to
me
you
bite
at
all
in
fact
she
said
simply
i
do
i
have
seen
too
much
of
and
so
you
think
a
rule
of
would
be
best
for
the
country
you
have
put
it
plainly
in
words
for
me
that
is
my
creed
that
is
the
creed
of
all
those
yonder
who
sit
in
the
camp
and
besiege
this
city
and
we
number
on
our
side
now
all
in
atlantis
save
those
in
the
city
and
a
handful
on
the
priests
i
shook
my
head
a
creed
of
desperation
if
you
like
nais
but
believe
me
a
silly
creed
since
man
was
born
out
of
the
quakings
and
the
fevers
of
this
earth
and
picked
his
way
amongst
the
he
has
been
dependent
always
on
his
and
where
two
are
congregated
together
one
must
be
chief
and
order
how
matters
are
to
be
governed
at
least
i
speak
of
men
who
have
a
wish
to
be
higher
than
the
beasts
have
you
ever
set
foot
in
europe
i
have
years
back
i
sailed
there
gathering
slaves
what
did
i
see
a
country
without
rule
or
order
tyrants
they
were
to
be
sure
but
they
were
the
beasts
the
men
and
the
women
were
the
rudest
savages
knowing
nothing
of
the
arts
dressing
in
skins
and
uncleanness
harbouring
in
caves
and
the
the
beasts
roamed
about
where
they
would
and
hunted
them
still
they
fought
you
for
their
liberty
never
once
they
knew
how
disastrous
was
their
masterless
freedom
even
to
their
dull
savage
brains
it
was
a
sure
thing
that
no
slavery
could
be
worse
and
to
that
state
you
and
your
friends
and
your
theories
will
reduce
atlantis
if
you
get
the
upper
hand
but
then
to
argue
in
a
circle
you
will
never
get
it
for
to
conquer
you
must
set
up
leaders
and
once
you
have
set
them
up
you
will
never
pull
them
down
aye
she
said
with
a
sigh
there
is
truth
in
that
the
torch
had
filled
the
captain
s
room
with
a
resinous
smoke
but
the
flame
was
growing
pale
dawn
was
coming
in
greyly
through
a
slender
and
with
it
ever
and
again
the
glow
from
some
mountain
out
of
sight
which
was
shooting
forth
spasmodic
bursts
of
fire
with
it
also
were
mutterings
of
distant
falling
rocks
and
sullen
tremblings
which
had
endured
all
the
night
through
and
i
judged
that
earth
was
in
one
of
her
quaking
moods
and
would
probably
during
the
forthcoming
day
offer
us
some
chastening
discomforts
on
this
account
perhaps
my
senses
were
stilled
to
certain
evidences
which
would
otherwise
have
given
me
a
suspicion
and
also
there
is
no
denying
that
my
general
wakefulness
was
sapped
by
another
matter
this
woman
nais
interested
me
vastly
out
of
the
common
the
mere
presence
of
her
seemed
to
warm
the
organs
of
my
interior
and
whilst
she
was
there
all
my
thoughts
and
senses
were
present
in
the
room
of
the
captain
of
the
gate
in
which
we
sat
but
of
a
sudden
the
floor
of
the
chamber
rocked
and
fell
away
beneath
me
and
in
a
tumult
of
dust
and
litter
and
bales
of
the
captain
s
plunder
i
fell
down
still
seated
on
the
flagstone
into
a
pit
which
had
been
digged
beneath
it
with
the
violence
of
the
descent
and
the
flutter
of
all
these
articles
about
my
head
i
was
in
no
condition
for
immediate
action
and
whilst
i
was
still
by
the
shock
and
long
before
i
could
get
my
eyes
into
service
again
i
had
been
seized
and
bound
and
with
a
noose
of
hide
voices
were
raised
that
i
should
be
despatched
at
once
out
of
the
way
but
one
in
authority
cried
out
that
killing
me
at
leisure
and
as
a
prisoner
promised
more
genteel
sport
and
so
i
was
thrust
down
on
the
floor
whilst
a
whole
army
of
men
trod
in
over
me
to
the
attack
what
had
happened
was
clear
to
me
now
though
i
was
powerless
to
do
anything
in
hindrance
the
rebels
with
more
craft
than
any
one
had
credited
to
them
had
driven
a
galley
from
their
camp
under
the
ground
intending
so
to
make
an
entrance
into
the
heart
of
the
city
in
their
clumsy
ignorance
and
having
no
one
of
sufficient
talent
in
mensuration
they
had
bungled
sadly
both
in
direction
and
length
and
so
had
ended
their
burrow
under
this
chamber
of
the
captain
of
the
gate
the
great
flagstone
in
its
fall
had
it
appeared
crushed
four
of
them
to
death
but
these
were
little
noticed
or
lamented
life
was
to
them
a
bauble
of
the
slenderest
price
and
a
horde
of
others
pressed
through
the
opening
lusting
for
the
fight
and
recking
nothing
of
their
risks
and
perils
by
the
foul
air
of
the
galley
and
trodden
on
by
this
great
procession
of
feet
it
was
little
enough
i
could
do
to
help
my
immediate
self
much
less
the
more
distant
city
but
when
the
chief
mass
of
the
attackers
had
passed
through
and
there
came
only
here
and
there
one
eager
to
take
his
share
at
storming
the
gate
a
couple
of
fellows
plucked
me
up
out
of
the
mud
on
the
floor
and
began
dragging
me
down
through
the
stinking
darkness
of
the
galley
towards
the
pit
that
gave
it
entrance
twenty
times
we
were
jostled
by
others
hastening
to
the
attack
either
from
hunger
for
fight
or
from
appetite
for
what
they
could
steal
but
we
came
to
the
open
at
last
and
though
i
was
i
contrived
to
do
obeisance
and
say
aloud
the
prescribed
prayer
to
the
most
high
gods
in
gratitude
for
the
fresh
sweet
air
which
they
had
provided
our
lord
the
sun
was
on
the
verge
of
rising
for
his
day
and
all
things
were
plainly
shown
before
me
were
the
monstrous
walls
of
the
capital
with
the
heads
of
its
pyramids
and
higher
buildings
showing
above
them
and
on
the
walls
the
sentries
walked
calmly
their
appointed
paces
or
took
shelter
against
arrows
in
the
casemates
provided
for
them
the
din
of
fighting
within
the
gate
rose
high
into
the
air
and
the
heavy
roaring
of
the
told
that
they
too
were
taking
their
share
of
the
melee
but
the
massive
stonework
of
the
walls
hid
all
the
actual
engagement
from
our
view
and
which
party
was
getting
the
upper
hand
we
could
not
even
guess
but
the
sounds
told
how
tight
a
fight
was
being
hammered
out
in
those
narrow
boundaries
and
my
veins
tingled
to
be
once
more
back
at
the
old
trade
and
to
be
doing
my
share
but
there
was
no
chivalry
about
the
fellows
who
held
me
by
my
bonds
they
thrust
me
into
a
small
temple
near
by
which
once
had
been
a
fane
in
much
favour
with
travellers
who
wished
to
show
gratitude
for
the
safe
journey
to
the
capital
but
which
now
was
robbed
and
ruined
and
they
swung
to
the
stone
entrance
gate
and
barred
it
leaving
me
to
commune
with
myself
presently
they
told
me
i
should
be
put
to
death
by
torments
well
this
seemed
to
be
the
new
custom
of
atlantis
and
i
should
have
to
endure
it
as
best
i
could
the
high
gods
it
appeared
had
no
further
use
for
my
services
in
atlantis
and
i
was
not
in
the
mood
then
to
bite
very
much
at
their
decision
what
i
had
seen
of
the
country
since
my
return
had
not
enamoured
me
very
much
with
its
new
conditions
the
little
temple
in
which
i
was
gaoled
had
been
robbed
and
despoiled
of
all
its
furnishments
but
the
where
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
the
rays
of
our
lord
the
sun
had
fallen
upon
the
image
of
the
god
before
this
had
been
taken
away
gave
me
vantage
places
from
which
i
could
see
over
the
camp
of
these
rebel
besiegers
and
a
dreary
prospect
it
was
the
people
seemed
to
have
shucked
off
the
culture
of
centuries
in
as
many
months
and
to
have
gone
back
for
the
most
part
to
sheer
brutishness
the
majority
harboured
on
the
bare
ground
few
owned
shelter
and
these
were
merely
bowers
of
mud
and
branches
they
fought
and
quarrelled
amongst
themselves
for
food
eating
their
meat
raw
and
their
grain
when
they
had
it
unground
many
who
passed
my
vision
i
saw
were
even
gnawing
the
soft
inside
of
tree
bark
the
dead
lay
where
they
fell
the
sick
and
the
wounded
found
no
hand
to
tend
them
great
birds
hovered
about
the
camp
or
skulked
about
heavy
with
gorging
amongst
the
hovels
and
no
one
had
public
spirit
enough
to
give
them
battle
the
stink
of
the
place
rose
up
to
heaven
as
a
foul
incense
inviting
a
pestilence
there
was
no
order
no
trace
of
strong
command
anywhere
with
three
hundred
troops
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
have
sent
those
poor
desperate
hordes
flying
in
panic
to
the
forest
however
there
was
no
very
lengthy
space
of
time
granted
me
for
thinking
out
the
policy
of
this
matter
to
any
great
depth
the
attack
on
the
gate
had
been
delivered
with
suddenness
the
repulse
was
not
slow
of
what
desperate
fighting
took
place
in
the
galleries
and
in
the
circus
between
the
two
sets
of
gates
the
detail
will
never
be
told
in
full
at
the
first
alarm
the
great
were
set
loose
and
these
raged
impartially
against
keeper
and
foe
of
those
that
went
in
through
the
tunnel
not
one
in
ten
returned
and
there
were
few
of
these
but
what
carried
a
bloody
wound
some
with
the
ruling
passion
still
strong
in
them
bore
back
plunder
one
trailed
along
with
him
the
head
of
the
captain
of
the
gate
and
amongst
them
they
dragged
out
two
of
the
warders
who
were
wounded
and
whom
revenge
had
urged
them
to
take
as
prisoners
over
these
two
last
a
hubbub
now
arose
that
seemed
likely
to
boil
over
into
blows
every
voice
shouted
out
for
them
what
he
thought
the
most
repulsive
fate
some
were
for
burning
some
for
skinning
some
for
impaling
some
for
other
things
my
flesh
crept
as
i
heard
their
ravenous
yells
those
that
had
been
to
the
trouble
of
making
them
captive
were
still
breathless
from
the
fight
and
were
readily
thrust
aside
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
poor
wretches
would
be
hustled
into
death
before
any
definite
fate
was
agreed
upon
which
all
would
pass
as
sufficiently
terrific
never
had
i
seen
such
a
disorderly
tumult
never
such
a
leaderless
mob
but
as
always
has
happened
and
always
will
the
stronger
men
by
dint
of
louder
voices
and
more
vigorous
shoulders
got
their
plans
agreed
to
at
last
and
the
others
perforce
had
to
give
way
a
band
of
them
set
off
running
and
presently
returned
at
snails
pace
dragging
with
them
with
many
squeals
from
ungreased
wheels
one
of
those
huge
war
engines
with
which
besiegers
are
wont
to
throw
great
stones
and
other
missiles
into
the
cities
they
sit
down
against
they
ran
it
up
just
beyond
bowshot
of
the
walls
and
clamped
it
firmly
down
with
stakes
and
ropes
to
the
earth
then
setting
their
lean
arms
to
the
windlasses
they
drew
back
the
great
tree
which
formed
the
spring
till
its
tethering
place
reached
the
ground
and
in
the
cradle
at
its
head
they
placed
one
of
the
prisoners
bound
helplessly
so
that
he
could
not
throw
himself
over
the
side
then
the
rude
savage
mob
stood
back
and
one
who
had
appointed
himself
engineer
knocked
back
the
catch
that
held
the
great
spring
in
place
with
a
whir
and
a
twang
the
elastic
wood
flung
upwards
and
the
bound
man
was
shot
away
from
its
tip
with
the
speed
of
a
lightning
flash
he
sang
through
the
air
spinning
over
and
over
with
inconceivable
rapidity
and
the
great
crowd
of
rebels
held
their
breath
in
silence
as
they
watched
he
passed
high
above
the
city
wall
a
tiny
mannikin
in
the
distance
now
and
then
the
trajectory
of
his
flight
began
to
lower
the
spike
of
a
pyramid
lay
in
the
path
of
his
terrific
flight
and
he
struck
it
with
a
thud
whose
sound
floated
out
to
us
afterwards
and
then
he
toppled
down
out
of
our
sight
leaving
a
red
stain
on
the
whiteness
of
the
stone
as
he
fell
with
a
roar
the
crowd
acknowledged
the
success
of
their
device
and
bellowed
out
insults
to
phorenice
and
insults
to
the
gods
a
poor
frantic
crowd
they
showed
themselves
and
then
with
ravening
shouts
they
fell
upon
the
other
captive
warder
binding
him
also
into
a
compact
helpless
missile
and
meanwhile
getting
the
engine
in
gear
again
for
another
shot
but
for
my
part
i
saw
nothing
of
this
disgusting
scene
i
heard
the
bolt
grate
stealthily
against
the
door
of
the
little
temple
in
which
i
was
imprisoned
and
was
minded
to
give
these
brutish
rebels
somewhat
of
a
surprise
i
had
rid
myself
of
my
bonds
handily
enough
i
had
rubbed
my
limbs
to
that
perfect
suppleness
which
is
always
desirable
before
a
fight
and
i
had
planned
to
rush
out
so
soon
as
the
door
was
swung
and
kill
those
that
came
first
with
fist
blows
on
the
brow
and
chin
they
had
not
suspected
my
name
it
was
clear
for
my
stature
and
garb
were
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
but
if
my
bodily
strength
and
fighting
power
had
been
sufficient
to
raise
me
to
a
like
that
of
yucatan
and
let
me
endure
alive
in
that
government
throughout
twenty
years
why
it
was
likely
that
this
rabble
of
savages
would
see
something
that
was
new
and
admirable
in
the
practice
of
arms
before
the
crude
weight
of
their
numbers
could
drag
me
down
nay
i
did
not
even
despair
of
winning
free
altogether
i
must
find
me
a
weapon
from
those
that
came
up
to
battle
with
which
i
could
write
worthy
signatures
and
i
must
attempt
no
standing
fights
gods
but
what
a
glow
the
prospect
did
send
through
me
as
i
stood
there
waiting
a
vainer
man
writing
history
might
have
said
that
always
before
everything
else
he
held
in
mind
the
greater
interests
before
the
less
but
for
me
i
prefer
to
be
honest
and
own
myself
human
in
my
glee
at
that
forthcoming
fight
which
promised
to
be
the
greatest
and
most
furious
i
had
known
in
all
a
long
life
of
battling
i
will
confess
that
atlantis
and
her
differing
policies
were
clean
forgot
i
should
go
out
an
unknown
man
from
the
little
cell
of
a
temple
i
should
do
my
work
and
then
whether
i
took
freedom
with
me
or
whether
i
came
down
at
last
myself
on
a
pile
of
slain
these
people
would
guess
without
being
told
the
name
that
here
was
deucalion
gods
what
a
fight
we
would
have
made
but
the
door
did
not
open
wide
to
give
me
space
for
my
first
rush
it
creaked
gratingly
outwards
on
its
pivots
and
a
slim
hand
and
a
white
arm
slipped
inside
beckoning
me
to
quietude
here
was
some
woman
the
door
creaked
wider
and
she
came
inside
nais
i
said
silence
or
they
will
hear
you
and
remember
at
present
those
who
brought
you
here
are
killed
and
unless
by
chance
some
one
blunders
into
this
robbed
shrine
you
will
not
be
then
if
that
is
so
let
me
go
out
and
walk
amongst
these
people
as
one
of
she
shook
her
head
but
nais
i
am
not
known
here
i
am
merely
a
man
in
very
plain
and
robe
i
should
be
in
no
ways
a
smile
twitched
her
face
my
lord
she
said
wears
no
beard
and
his
is
the
only
clean
chin
in
the
i
joined
in
her
laugh
a
pest
on
my
want
of
foppishness
then
but
i
am
forgetting
somewhat
it
comes
to
my
mind
that
we
still
have
unfinished
that
small
discussion
of
ours
concerning
the
length
of
my
poor
life
have
you
decided
to
cut
it
off
from
risk
of
further
mischief
or
do
you
propose
to
give
me
further
span
she
turned
to
me
with
a
look
of
sharp
distress
my
lord
she
said
i
would
have
you
forget
that
silly
talk
of
mine
this
last
two
hours
i
thought
you
were
dead
in
real
and
you
were
not
relieved
i
felt
that
the
only
man
was
gone
out
of
the
world
i
mean
my
lord
the
only
man
who
can
save
your
words
give
me
a
confidence
then
you
would
have
me
go
back
and
become
husband
to
phorenice
if
there
is
no
other
i
warn
you
i
shall
do
that
if
she
still
so
desires
it
and
if
it
seems
to
me
that
that
course
will
be
best
this
is
no
hour
for
private
likings
or
i
know
it
she
said
i
feel
it
i
have
no
heart
now
save
only
for
atlantis
i
have
schooled
myself
once
more
to
and
at
present
i
am
in
this
lone
little
box
of
a
temple
a
minute
ago
before
you
came
i
had
promised
myself
a
pretty
enough
fight
to
signalise
my
changing
of
there
must
be
nothing
of
that
i
will
not
have
these
poor
people
slaughtered
unnecessarily
nor
do
i
wish
to
see
my
lord
exposed
to
a
hopeless
risk
this
poor
place
such
as
it
is
has
been
given
to
me
as
an
abode
and
if
my
lord
can
remain
decorously
till
nightfall
in
a
maiden
s
chamber
he
may
at
least
be
sure
of
quietude
i
am
a
person
she
added
simply
that
in
this
camp
has
some
respect
when
darkness
comes
i
will
take
my
lord
down
to
the
sea
and
a
boat
and
so
he
may
come
with
ease
to
the
harbour
and
the
the
preacher
from
the
mountains
it
was
long
enough
since
i
had
found
leisure
for
a
parcel
of
sleep
and
so
during
the
larger
part
of
that
day
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
slumbered
soundly
nais
watching
me
night
fell
and
still
we
remained
within
the
privacy
of
the
temple
it
was
our
plan
that
i
should
stay
there
till
the
camp
slept
and
so
i
should
have
more
chance
of
reaching
the
sea
without
disturbance
the
night
came
down
wet
with
a
drizzle
of
rain
and
through
the
slits
in
the
temple
walls
we
could
see
the
many
fires
in
the
camp
well
cared
for
the
men
and
women
in
skins
and
rags
toasting
before
them
with
steam
rising
as
the
heat
fought
with
their
wetness
folk
seated
in
discomfort
like
this
are
proverbially
alert
and
cruel
in
the
temper
and
nais
frowned
as
she
looked
on
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
a
fine
night
she
said
and
i
would
have
sent
my
lord
back
to
the
city
without
a
soul
here
being
the
wiser
but
in
this
chill
people
sleep
sourly
we
must
wait
till
the
hour
drugs
them
and
so
we
waited
sitting
there
together
on
that
pavement
so
long
unkissed
by
worshippers
and
it
was
little
enough
we
said
aloud
but
there
can
be
good
companionship
without
sentences
of
talk
but
as
the
hours
drew
on
the
night
began
to
grow
less
quiet
from
the
distance
some
one
began
to
blow
on
a
horn
or
a
shell
sending
forth
a
harsh
raucous
note
incessantly
the
sound
came
nearer
as
we
could
tell
from
its
growing
loudness
and
the
voices
of
those
by
the
fires
made
themselves
heard
railing
at
the
blower
for
his
disturbance
and
presently
it
became
stationary
and
standing
up
we
could
see
through
the
slits
in
the
walls
the
people
of
the
camp
rousing
up
from
their
uneasy
rest
and
clustering
together
round
one
who
stood
and
talked
to
them
from
the
pedestal
of
a
war
engine
what
he
was
declaiming
upon
we
could
not
hear
and
our
curiosity
on
the
matter
was
not
keen
given
that
all
who
did
not
sleep
went
to
weary
themselves
with
this
fellow
as
nais
whispered
it
would
be
simple
for
me
to
make
an
exit
in
the
opposite
direction
but
here
we
were
reckoning
without
the
inevitable
busybody
a
dozen
pairs
of
feet
splashing
through
the
wet
came
up
to
the
side
of
the
little
temple
and
cried
loudly
that
nais
should
join
the
audience
she
had
eloquence
of
tongue
it
appeared
and
they
feared
lest
this
speaker
who
had
taken
his
stand
on
the
war
engine
should
make
schisms
amongst
their
ranks
unless
some
skilled
person
stood
up
also
to
refute
his
arguments
here
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
be
elbowed
into
my
skirmish
by
the
most
unexpected
of
chances
but
nais
was
firmly
minded
that
there
should
be
no
fight
if
courage
on
her
part
could
turn
it
come
out
with
me
she
whispered
and
keep
distant
from
the
light
of
the
but
how
explain
my
being
here
there
is
no
reason
to
explain
anything
she
said
bitterly
they
will
take
you
for
my
lover
there
is
nothing
remarkable
in
that
it
is
the
mode
here
but
oh
why
did
not
the
gods
make
you
wear
a
beard
and
curl
it
even
as
other
men
then
you
could
have
been
gone
and
safe
these
two
a
smooth
chin
pleases
me
so
it
does
me
i
heard
her
murmur
as
she
leaned
her
weight
on
the
stone
which
hung
in
the
doorway
and
pushed
it
ajar
your
the
ragged
men
outside
there
were
women
with
them
also
did
not
wait
to
watch
me
very
closely
a
coarse
jest
or
two
flew
which
i
could
have
found
good
heart
to
have
repaid
with
a
and
they
stepped
off
into
the
darkness
just
turning
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
we
followed
on
all
sides
others
were
pressing
in
the
same
direction
black
shadows
against
the
night
the
rain
spat
noisily
on
the
camp
fires
as
we
passed
them
and
from
behind
us
came
up
others
there
were
no
sleepers
in
the
camp
now
all
were
pressing
on
to
hear
this
preacher
who
stood
on
the
pedestal
of
the
war
engine
and
if
we
had
tried
to
swerve
from
the
straight
course
we
should
have
been
marked
at
once
so
we
held
on
through
the
darkness
and
presently
came
within
earshot
still
it
was
little
enough
of
the
preacher
s
words
we
could
make
out
at
first
who
are
your
chiefs
came
the
question
at
the
end
of
a
fervid
harangue
and
immediately
all
further
rational
talk
was
drowned
in
uproar
we
have
no
chiefs
the
people
shouted
we
are
done
with
chiefs
we
are
all
equal
here
take
away
your
silly
magic
you
may
kill
us
with
magic
if
you
choose
but
rule
us
you
shall
not
nor
shall
the
other
priests
rule
nor
phorenice
nor
anybody
we
are
done
with
the
press
had
brought
us
closer
and
closer
to
the
man
who
stood
on
the
war
engine
we
saw
him
to
be
old
with
white
hair
that
tumbled
on
his
shoulders
and
a
long
white
beard
untrimmed
and
uncurled
save
for
a
wisp
of
rag
about
the
loins
his
body
was
unclothed
and
glistened
in
the
wet
but
in
his
hand
he
held
that
which
marked
his
caste
with
it
he
pointed
his
sentences
and
at
times
he
whirled
it
about
bathing
his
wet
naked
body
in
a
halo
of
light
it
was
a
wand
whose
tip
burned
with
an
unconsuming
fire
which
glowed
and
twinkled
and
blazed
like
some
star
sent
down
by
the
gods
from
their
own
place
in
the
high
heaven
it
was
the
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
a
credential
no
one
could
forge
and
one
on
which
no
civilised
man
would
cast
a
doubt
indeed
the
ragged
frantic
crew
did
not
question
for
one
moment
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
clan
of
priests
the
clan
which
from
time
out
of
numbering
had
given
rulers
for
the
land
and
even
in
their
loudest
clamours
they
freely
acknowledged
his
powers
you
may
kill
us
with
your
magic
if
you
choose
they
screamed
at
him
but
stubbornly
they
refused
to
come
back
to
their
old
allegiance
we
have
suffered
too
many
things
these
later
years
they
cried
we
are
done
with
rulers
now
for
but
for
myself
i
saw
the
old
man
with
a
different
emotion
here
was
zaemon
that
was
father
to
nais
zaemon
that
had
seen
me
yesterday
seated
on
the
divan
at
phorenice
s
elbow
and
who
could
denounce
me
as
deucalion
if
so
he
chose
these
rebels
had
expended
a
navy
in
their
wish
to
kill
me
four
days
earlier
and
if
they
knew
of
my
nearness
even
though
nais
were
my
advocate
her
cold
reasoning
would
have
had
little
chance
of
an
audience
now
the
high
gods
who
keep
the
tether
of
our
lives
hide
their
secrets
well
but
i
did
not
think
it
impious
to
be
sure
that
mine
was
very
near
the
cutting
then
the
beautiful
woman
saw
this
too
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
twine
her
fingers
in
mine
and
press
them
as
a
farewell
and
i
pressed
hers
in
return
for
i
was
sorry
enough
not
to
see
her
more
still
i
could
not
help
letting
my
thoughts
travel
with
a
grim
gloating
over
the
fine
mound
of
dead
i
should
build
before
these
ragged
unskilled
rebels
pulled
me
down
and
it
was
inevitable
this
should
be
so
for
of
all
the
emotions
that
can
ferment
in
the
human
heart
the
joy
of
strife
is
keenest
and
none
but
an
old
fighter
face
to
face
with
what
must
necessarily
be
his
final
battle
can
tell
how
deep
this
lust
is
embroidered
into
the
very
foundations
of
his
being
but
for
the
time
zaemon
did
not
see
me
being
too
much
wrapped
in
his
outcry
and
so
i
was
free
to
listen
to
the
burning
words
which
he
spread
around
him
and
to
determine
their
effect
on
the
hearers
the
theme
he
preached
was
no
new
one
he
told
that
ever
since
the
beginning
of
history
the
gods
had
set
apart
one
clan
of
the
people
to
rule
over
the
rest
and
be
their
priests
and
until
the
coming
of
phorenice
these
had
done
their
duties
with
exactitude
and
justice
they
had
fought
invaders
carried
war
against
the
beasts
and
studied
so
that
they
were
able
to
foretell
earthquakes
and
eruptions
and
could
spread
warnings
that
the
people
might
be
able
to
escape
their
devastations
they
are
no
their
aim
was
always
to
further
the
interest
of
atlantis
and
so
do
honour
to
the
kingdom
on
which
the
high
gods
had
set
their
special
favour
under
the
priestly
clan
atlantis
had
reached
the
pinnacle
of
human
prosperity
and
happiness
but
cried
the
old
man
waving
the
symbol
till
his
wet
body
glistened
in
a
halo
of
light
the
people
grew
fat
and
careless
with
their
easy
life
they
began
to
have
a
conceit
that
their
good
fortune
was
earned
by
their
own
puny
brains
and
thews
and
was
no
gift
from
the
gods
above
and
presently
the
cult
of
these
gods
became
neglected
and
their
temples
were
barren
of
gifts
and
worshippers
followed
a
punishment
the
gods
in
their
inscrutable
way
decreed
that
a
wife
of
one
of
the
priests
that
was
a
governor
of
no
inconsiderable
province
should
see
a
woman
child
by
the
wayside
and
take
it
for
adoption
that
child
the
gods
in
their
infinite
wisdom
fashioned
into
a
scourge
for
atlantis
and
you
who
have
felt
the
weight
of
phorenice
s
hand
know
with
what
completeness
the
high
gods
can
fashion
their
instruments
yet
even
as
they
set
up
so
can
they
throw
down
and
those
that
shall
debase
phorenice
are
even
now
appointed
the
old
rule
is
to
be
but
not
till
you
who
have
sinned
are
sufficiently
chastened
to
cry
to
it
for
he
waved
the
mysterious
glowing
symbol
before
him
see
he
cried
in
his
high
old
quavering
voice
you
know
the
unspeakable
power
of
which
that
is
the
sign
and
for
which
i
am
the
mouthpiece
it
is
for
you
to
make
decision
now
are
the
gods
to
throw
down
this
woman
who
has
scorned
them
and
so
cruelly
trodden
on
you
or
are
you
to
be
still
further
purged
of
your
pride
before
you
are
ripe
for
deliverance
the
old
priest
broke
off
with
a
gesture
and
his
ragged
white
beard
sank
on
to
his
chest
promptly
a
young
man
skin
clad
and
carrying
his
weapon
elbowed
up
through
the
press
of
listeners
and
jumped
on
to
the
platform
beside
him
hear
me
brethren
he
bellowed
in
his
strong
young
voice
we
are
done
with
tyrants
death
may
come
and
we
all
of
us
here
have
shown
how
little
we
fear
it
but
own
rulers
again
we
will
not
and
that
is
our
final
say
my
lord
he
said
turning
to
the
old
man
with
a
brave
face
i
know
it
is
in
your
power
to
kill
me
by
magic
if
you
choose
but
i
have
said
my
say
and
can
stand
the
cost
if
needs
i
can
kill
you
but
i
will
not
said
zaemon
you
have
said
your
silliness
now
go
you
to
the
ground
we
have
free
speech
here
i
will
not
go
till
i
aye
but
you
will
said
the
old
man
and
turned
on
him
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
brows
there
was
no
blow
passed
even
the
symbol
which
glowed
like
a
star
against
the
night
was
not
so
much
as
lifted
in
warning
but
the
young
man
tried
to
retort
and
finding
himself
smitten
with
a
sudden
dumbness
turned
with
a
spasm
of
fear
and
jumped
back
whence
he
had
come
the
crowd
of
them
thrilled
expectantly
and
when
no
further
portent
was
given
they
began
to
shout
that
a
miracle
should
be
shown
them
and
then
perchance
they
would
be
persuaded
back
to
the
old
allegiance
the
old
man
stooped
and
glowered
at
them
in
fury
you
dogs
he
cried
you
dogs
do
you
ask
that
i
should
degrade
the
powers
of
the
higher
mysteries
by
dancing
them
out
before
you
as
though
they
were
a
mummers
show
do
you
tickle
yourselves
that
you
are
to
be
tempted
back
to
your
allegiance
it
is
for
you
to
woo
the
gods
who
are
so
offended
come
in
humility
and
i
take
it
upon
myself
to
declare
that
you
will
receive
fitting
pardon
and
relief
remain
stubborn
and
the
scourge
phorenice
may
torment
you
into
annihilation
before
she
in
turn
is
made
to
answer
for
the
evil
she
has
put
upon
the
land
there
is
the
choice
for
you
to
pick
the
turmoil
of
voices
rose
again
into
the
wetness
of
the
night
and
weapons
were
upraised
menacingly
it
was
clear
that
the
party
for
independence
had
by
far
the
greater
weight
both
in
numbers
and
lustiness
and
those
who
might
from
sheer
weariness
of
strife
have
been
willing
for
surrender
withheld
their
word
through
terror
of
the
consequence
it
was
a
fine
comment
on
the
freedom
of
speech
about
which
these
unruly
fools
had
made
their
boast
and
with
a
sly
malice
i
could
not
help
whispering
a
word
on
this
to
nais
as
she
stood
at
my
elbow
but
nais
clutched
at
my
hand
and
implored
me
for
caution
oh
be
silent
my
lord
she
whispered
back
or
they
will
tear
you
in
pieces
they
are
on
fire
for
mischief
yet
a
few
hours
back
you
were
for
killing
me
yourself
i
could
not
help
reminding
her
she
turned
on
me
with
a
hot
look
a
woman
can
change
her
mind
my
lord
but
it
becomes
you
little
to
remind
her
of
her
a
man
in
the
press
beside
me
wrenched
round
with
an
effort
and
stared
at
me
searchingly
through
the
darkness
oh
he
said
a
shaved
chin
who
are
you
friend
that
you
should
cut
a
beard
instead
of
curling
it
i
can
see
no
wound
on
your
i
answered
him
civilly
enough
that
with
freedom
for
a
watchword
the
fashion
of
my
chin
was
a
matter
of
mere
private
concern
but
as
that
did
not
satisfy
him
and
as
he
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
quarrelsome
fellows
that
are
the
bane
of
every
community
i
took
him
suddenly
by
the
throat
and
the
shoulder
and
bent
his
neck
with
the
old
quick
turn
till
i
heard
it
crack
and
had
unhanded
him
before
any
of
his
neighbours
had
seen
what
had
befallen
the
fierce
press
of
the
crowd
held
him
from
slipping
to
the
ground
and
so
he
stood
on
there
where
he
was
with
his
head
nodded
forward
as
though
he
had
fallen
asleep
through
heaviness
or
had
fainted
through
the
crushing
of
his
fellows
i
had
no
desire
to
begin
that
last
fight
of
mine
in
a
place
like
this
where
there
was
no
room
to
swing
a
weapon
nor
chance
to
clear
a
battle
ring
but
all
this
time
the
lean
preacher
from
the
mountains
was
sending
forth
his
angry
anathemas
and
still
holding
the
strained
attention
of
the
people
and
next
he
set
forth
before
them
the
cult
of
the
gods
in
the
ancient
form
as
is
prescribed
and
they
with
old
habit
coming
back
to
them
made
response
in
the
words
and
in
the
places
where
the
old
ritual
enjoins
it
was
weird
enough
sight
that
service
of
adoration
forced
upon
these
wild
people
after
so
long
a
period
of
irreligion
they
warmed
to
the
old
words
as
the
high
shrill
voice
of
the
priest
cried
them
forth
and
as
they
listened
and
as
they
realised
how
intimate
was
the
care
of
the
gods
for
the
travails
and
sorrows
of
their
daily
lives
so
much
warmer
grew
their
responses
who
stilled
the
burning
of
the
mountains
and
made
cool
places
on
the
earth
for
us
to
live
praise
to
the
most
high
gods
who
gave
us
mastery
over
the
lesser
beasts
and
skill
of
ten
times
to
prevail
praise
to
the
most
high
gods
who
gave
us
mastery
over
the
lesser
beasts
and
skill
of
ten
times
to
prevail
praise
to
the
most
high
gods
it
thrilled
one
to
hear
their
earnestness
it
sorrowed
one
to
know
that
they
would
yet
be
obdurate
and
not
return
to
their
old
allegiance
for
this
is
the
way
with
these
common
people
they
will
work
up
an
enthusiasm
one
minute
and
an
hour
later
it
will
have
fled
away
and
left
them
cold
and
empty
but
zaemon
made
no
further
calls
upon
their
loyalty
he
finished
the
prescribed
form
of
sentences
and
stepped
down
off
the
platform
of
the
war
engine
with
the
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
thrust
out
resolutely
before
him
to
all
ordinary
seeming
the
crowd
had
been
packed
so
that
no
further
compression
was
possible
but
before
the
advance
of
the
symbol
the
people
crushed
back
leaving
a
wide
lane
for
his
passage
and
here
came
the
turning
point
of
my
life
at
first
like
i
take
it
every
one
else
in
that
crowd
i
imagined
that
the
old
man
having
finished
his
mission
was
making
a
way
to
return
to
the
place
from
which
he
had
come
but
he
held
steadily
to
one
direction
and
as
that
was
towards
myself
it
naturally
came
to
my
mind
that
having
dealt
with
greater
things
he
would
now
settle
with
the
less
or
in
plainer
words
that
having
put
his
policy
before
the
swarming
people
he
would
now
smite
down
the
man
he
had
seen
but
yesterday
seated
as
phorenice
s
minister
well
i
should
lose
that
final
fight
i
had
promised
myself
and
that
mound
of
slain
for
my
funeral
bed
it
was
clear
that
zaemon
was
the
mouthpiece
of
the
priests
clan
duly
appointed
and
i
also
was
a
priest
if
the
word
had
been
given
on
the
sacred
mountain
to
those
who
sat
before
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
that
atlantis
would
prosper
more
with
deucalion
sent
to
the
gods
i
was
ready
to
bow
to
the
sentence
with
submissiveness
that
i
had
regret
for
this
mode
of
cutting
off
i
will
not
deny
no
man
who
has
practised
the
game
of
arms
could
abandon
the
promise
of
such
a
gorgeous
final
battle
without
a
qualm
of
longing
but
i
had
been
trained
enough
to
show
none
of
these
emotions
on
my
face
and
when
the
old
man
came
up
to
me
i
stood
my
ground
and
gave
him
the
salutation
prescribed
between
our
ranks
which
he
returned
to
me
with
circumstance
and
accuracy
the
crowd
fell
back
being
driven
away
by
the
ineffable
force
of
the
symbol
leaving
us
alone
in
the
middle
of
a
ring
even
nais
though
she
was
a
priest
s
daughter
was
ignorant
of
the
mysteries
and
could
not
withstand
its
force
and
so
we
two
men
stood
there
alone
together
with
the
glow
of
the
symbol
bathing
us
and
lighting
up
the
sea
of
ravenous
faces
that
watched
the
people
were
quick
to
put
their
natural
explanation
on
the
scene
a
spy
they
began
to
roar
out
a
spy
zaemon
salutes
him
as
a
priest
zaemon
faced
round
on
them
with
a
queer
look
on
his
grim
old
face
aye
he
said
this
is
a
priest
if
i
give
you
his
name
you
might
have
further
interest
this
is
the
lord
the
word
was
picked
up
and
yelled
amongst
them
with
a
thousand
emotions
but
at
least
they
were
loyal
to
their
policy
they
had
decided
that
deucalion
was
their
enemy
they
had
already
expended
a
navy
for
his
destruction
and
now
that
he
was
ringed
in
by
their
masses
they
lusted
to
tear
him
into
rags
with
their
fingers
but
rave
and
rave
though
they
might
against
me
the
glare
from
the
symbol
drove
them
shuddering
back
as
though
it
had
been
a
and
zaemon
was
not
the
man
to
hand
me
over
to
their
fury
until
he
had
delivered
formal
sentence
as
the
emissary
of
our
clan
on
the
sacred
mount
so
the
end
was
not
to
be
yet
the
old
man
faced
me
and
spoke
in
the
sacred
tongue
which
the
common
people
do
not
know
my
brother
he
said
which
have
you
come
to
serve
deucalion
or
atlantis
words
are
a
poor
thing
to
answer
a
question
like
that
you
will
know
all
of
my
record
according
to
the
law
of
the
priests
each
ship
from
yucatan
will
have
carried
home
its
sworn
report
to
lay
at
the
feet
of
their
council
and
before
i
went
to
that
what
i
did
was
written
plain
here
on
the
face
of
we
know
your
doings
in
the
past
brother
and
they
have
found
approval
you
have
governed
well
and
you
have
lived
austerely
you
set
up
atlantis
for
a
mistress
and
served
her
well
but
then
you
have
had
no
phorenice
to
tempt
you
into
change
and
you
can
send
me
where
i
shall
see
her
no
more
if
you
think
me
yes
and
lose
your
usefulness
no
brother
you
are
the
last
hope
which
this
poor
land
has
remaining
all
other
human
means
that
have
been
tried
against
phorenice
have
failed
you
have
returned
from
overseas
for
the
final
duel
you
are
the
strongest
man
we
have
and
you
are
our
final
champion
if
you
fail
then
only
those
terrible
powers
which
are
locked
within
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
remains
to
us
and
though
it
is
not
lawful
to
speak
even
in
this
hidden
tongue
of
their
scope
you
at
least
have
full
assurance
of
their
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
it
seems
that
you
would
save
time
and
pains
if
you
threw
me
to
these
wolves
of
rebels
and
let
them
end
me
here
and
the
old
man
frowned
on
me
angrily
i
am
bidding
you
do
your
duty
what
reason
have
you
for
wishing
to
evade
it
i
have
in
my
memory
the
words
you
spoke
in
the
pyramid
when
you
came
in
amongst
the
banqueters
phorenice
was
your
cry
whilst
you
are
yet
empress
you
shall
see
this
royal
pyramid
which
you
have
polluted
with
your
debaucheries
torn
tier
from
tier
and
stone
from
stone
and
scattered
as
feathers
before
a
it
seems
that
you
foresee
my
the
old
man
shuddered
i
can
not
tell
what
she
may
force
us
to
do
i
spoke
then
only
what
it
was
revealed
to
me
must
happen
perhaps
when
matters
have
reached
that
pass
she
will
repent
and
submit
but
in
the
meanwhile
before
we
use
the
more
desperate
weapons
of
the
gods
it
is
fitting
that
we
should
expend
all
human
power
remaining
to
us
and
so
you
must
go
my
brother
and
play
your
part
to
the
it
is
an
order
so
i
you
shall
be
at
phorenice
s
side
again
by
the
next
dawn
she
has
sent
for
you
from
yucatan
as
a
husband
and
as
one
who
so
she
thinks
poor
human
conqueror
has
the
weight
of
arm
necessary
to
prolong
her
tyrannies
you
are
a
priest
brother
and
you
are
a
man
of
convincing
tongue
it
will
be
your
part
to
make
her
stubborn
mind
see
the
invincible
power
that
can
be
loosed
against
her
to
point
out
to
her
the
utter
hopelessness
of
prevailing
against
if
it
is
ordered
i
will
do
these
things
but
there
is
little
enough
chance
of
success
i
have
seen
phorenice
and
can
gauge
her
will
there
will
be
no
turning
her
once
she
has
made
a
decision
others
have
tried
you
have
tried
yourself
all
have
words
that
were
wasted
on
a
maiden
may
go
home
to
a
wife
you
have
been
brought
here
to
be
her
husband
well
take
your
the
order
came
to
me
with
a
pang
i
had
given
little
enough
heed
to
women
through
all
of
a
busy
life
though
when
i
landed
the
taking
of
phorenice
to
wife
would
not
have
been
very
repugnant
to
me
if
policy
had
demanded
it
but
the
matters
of
the
last
two
days
had
put
things
in
a
different
shape
i
had
seen
two
other
women
who
had
strangely
attracted
me
and
one
of
these
had
stirred
within
me
a
tumult
such
as
i
had
never
felt
before
amongst
my
economies
to
lead
phorenice
in
marriage
would
mean
a
severance
from
this
other
woman
eternally
and
i
ached
as
i
thought
of
it
but
though
these
thoughts
floated
through
my
system
and
gave
me
harsh
wrenches
of
pain
i
did
not
thrust
my
puny
likings
before
the
command
of
the
council
of
the
priests
i
bowed
before
zaemon
and
put
his
hand
to
my
forehead
it
is
an
order
i
said
if
our
lord
the
sun
gives
me
life
i
will
then
let
us
begone
from
this
place
said
zaemon
and
took
me
by
the
arm
and
waved
a
way
for
us
with
the
symbol
no
further
word
did
i
have
with
nais
fearing
to
embroil
her
with
these
rebels
who
clustered
round
but
i
caught
one
hot
glance
from
her
eyes
and
that
had
to
suffice
for
farewell
the
dense
ranks
of
the
crowd
opened
and
we
walked
away
between
them
scathless
fiercely
though
they
lusted
for
my
life
brimming
with
hate
though
they
made
their
cries
no
man
dared
to
rush
in
and
raise
a
hand
against
me
neither
did
they
follow
when
we
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
and
the
ranks
thinned
they
had
a
mind
many
of
them
to
surge
along
in
our
wake
but
zaemon
whirled
the
symbol
back
before
their
faces
with
a
blaze
of
lurid
light
and
they
fell
to
their
knees
grovelling
and
pressed
on
us
no
more
the
rain
still
fell
and
in
the
light
of
the
camp
fires
as
we
passed
them
the
wet
gleamed
on
the
old
man
s
wasted
body
and
far
before
us
through
the
darkness
loomed
the
vast
bulk
of
the
sacred
mountain
with
the
ring
of
eternal
fires
encincturing
its
crest
i
sighed
as
i
thought
of
the
old
peaceful
days
i
had
spent
in
its
temple
and
groves
but
there
was
to
be
no
more
of
that
studious
leisure
now
there
was
work
to
be
done
work
for
atlantis
which
did
not
brook
delay
and
so
when
we
had
progressed
far
out
into
the
waste
and
there
was
none
near
to
view
save
only
the
most
high
gods
we
found
the
place
where
the
passage
was
whose
entrance
is
known
only
to
the
seven
amongst
the
priests
and
there
we
parted
zaemon
to
his
hermitage
in
the
dangerous
lands
and
i
by
this
secret
way
back
into
the
capital
phorenice
goddess
now
the
passage
though
its
entrance
had
been
cunningly
hidden
by
man
s
artifice
was
one
of
those
veins
in
which
the
fiery
blood
of
our
mother
the
earth
had
aforetime
coursed
long
years
had
passed
since
it
carried
lava
streams
but
the
air
in
it
was
still
warm
and
sulphurous
and
there
was
no
inducement
to
linger
in
transit
i
lit
me
a
lamp
which
i
found
in
an
appointed
niche
and
walked
briskly
along
my
ways
coughing
and
wishing
heartily
i
had
some
of
those
simples
which
ease
a
throat
that
has
a
tendency
to
catarrh
but
alas
all
that
packet
of
drugs
which
were
my
sole
spoil
from
the
of
yucatan
were
lost
in
the
with
dason
s
navy
and
since
landing
in
atlantis
there
had
been
little
enough
time
to
think
for
the
refinements
of
medicine
the
network
of
branched
prodigiously
and
if
any
but
one
of
us
seven
priests
had
found
a
way
into
its
recesses
by
chance
he
would
have
perished
hopelessly
in
the
windings
or
have
fallen
into
one
of
those
pits
which
lead
to
the
boil
below
but
i
carried
the
chart
of
the
true
course
clearly
in
my
head
remembering
it
from
that
old
initiation
of
twenty
years
back
when
as
an
appointed
viceroy
i
was
raised
to
the
highest
degree
but
one
known
to
our
clan
and
was
given
its
secrets
and
working
implements
the
way
was
long
the
floor
was
monstrous
uneven
and
the
air
as
i
have
said
bad
and
i
knew
that
day
would
be
far
advanced
before
the
signs
told
me
that
i
had
passed
beneath
the
walls
and
was
well
within
the
precincts
of
the
city
and
here
the
vow
of
the
seven
hampered
my
progress
for
it
is
ordained
that
under
no
circumstances
whatever
the
stress
shall
egress
be
made
from
this
passage
before
mortal
eye
one
branch
after
another
did
i
try
but
always
found
loiterers
near
the
exits
i
had
hoped
to
make
my
emergence
by
that
path
which
came
inside
the
royal
pyramid
but
there
was
no
chance
of
coming
up
unobserved
here
the
place
was
humming
like
a
hive
and
so
too
with
each
of
the
five
next
outlets
that
i
visited
the
city
was
agog
with
some
strange
excitement
but
i
came
at
last
to
a
temple
of
one
of
the
lesser
gods
and
stood
behind
the
image
for
a
while
making
observation
the
place
was
empty
nay
from
the
dust
which
robed
all
the
floors
and
the
seats
of
the
worshippers
it
had
been
empty
long
enough
so
i
moved
all
that
was
needful
stepped
out
and
closed
all
entry
behind
me
a
broom
lay
unnoticed
on
one
of
the
pews
and
with
this
i
soon
disguised
all
route
of
footmark
and
took
my
way
to
the
temple
door
it
was
shut
and
priest
though
i
was
the
secret
of
its
opening
was
beyond
me
here
was
a
pretty
pass
no
one
but
the
attendant
priests
of
the
temple
could
move
the
mechanism
which
closed
and
opened
the
massive
stone
which
filled
the
doorway
and
if
all
had
gone
out
to
attend
this
spectacle
whatever
it
might
be
that
was
stirring
the
city
why
there
i
should
be
no
nearer
enlargement
than
before
there
was
no
sound
of
life
within
the
temple
precincts
there
were
evidences
of
decay
and
disuse
spread
broadcast
on
every
hand
but
according
to
the
ancient
law
there
should
be
eternally
one
at
least
on
watch
in
the
priests
dwellings
so
down
the
passages
which
led
to
them
i
made
my
way
it
would
have
surprised
me
little
to
have
found
even
these
deserted
that
the
old
order
was
changed
i
knew
but
i
was
only
then
beginning
to
realise
the
ruthlessness
with
which
it
had
been
swept
away
and
how
much
it
had
given
place
to
the
new
however
there
can
be
some
faithful
men
remaining
even
in
an
age
of
general
apostasy
and
on
making
my
way
to
the
door
of
the
dwelling
which
lay
in
the
roof
of
the
temple
i
gave
the
call
and
presently
it
was
opened
to
me
the
man
who
stood
before
me
peering
dully
through
the
gloom
had
at
least
remained
constant
to
his
vows
and
i
made
the
salutation
before
him
with
a
feeling
of
respect
his
name
was
ro
and
i
remembered
him
well
we
had
passed
through
the
sacred
college
together
and
always
he
had
been
known
as
the
dullard
he
had
capacity
for
learning
little
of
the
cult
of
the
gods
less
of
the
arts
of
ruling
less
still
of
the
handling
of
arms
and
he
had
been
appointed
to
some
lowly
office
in
this
obscure
temple
and
had
risen
to
being
its
second
priest
and
one
of
its
two
custodians
merely
through
the
desertion
of
all
his
colleagues
but
it
was
not
pleasant
to
think
that
a
fool
should
remain
true
where
cleverer
men
abandoned
the
old
beliefs
ro
did
before
me
the
greater
obeisance
he
wore
his
beard
curled
in
the
prevailing
fashion
but
it
was
badly
done
his
clothing
was
and
unbrushed
he
always
had
been
a
slovenly
fellow
the
temple
door
is
shut
he
said
and
i
only
have
the
secret
of
its
opening
my
lord
comes
here
therefore
by
the
secret
way
and
as
one
of
the
seven
i
am
my
lord
s
then
i
ask
this
small
service
of
you
tell
me
what
stirs
the
city
that
impious
phorenice
has
declared
herself
goddess
and
declares
that
she
will
light
the
sacrifice
with
her
own
divine
fire
she
will
do
it
too
she
does
everything
but
i
wish
the
flames
may
burn
her
when
she
calls
them
down
this
new
empress
is
the
bane
of
our
clan
deucalion
these
latter
days
the
people
neglect
us
they
bring
no
offerings
and
now
since
these
rebels
have
been
hammering
at
the
walls
i
might
have
gone
hungry
if
i
had
not
some
small
store
of
my
own
oh
i
tell
you
the
cult
of
the
true
gods
is
oozed
quite
out
of
the
my
brother
it
comes
to
my
mind
that
the
priests
of
our
clan
have
been
limp
in
their
service
to
let
these
things
come
to
i
suppose
we
have
done
our
best
at
least
we
did
as
we
were
taught
but
if
the
people
will
not
come
to
hear
your
exhortations
and
neglect
to
adore
the
god
what
hold
have
you
over
their
religion
but
i
tell
you
deucalion
that
the
high
gods
try
our
own
faith
hard
come
into
the
dwelling
here
look
there
on
my
i
saw
the
shape
of
a
man
untidily
swathed
in
reddened
bandages
this
is
all
that
is
left
of
the
poor
priest
that
was
my
immediate
superior
in
this
cure
it
was
his
turn
yesterday
to
celebrate
the
weekly
sacrifice
to
our
lord
the
sun
with
the
circle
of
his
great
stones
faugh
deucalion
you
should
have
seen
how
he
was
mangled
when
they
brought
him
back
to
me
did
the
people
rise
on
him
has
it
come
to
that
the
people
stayed
passive
said
ro
bitterly
what
few
of
them
had
interest
to
attend
but
our
lord
the
sun
saw
fit
to
try
his
minister
somewhat
harshly
the
wood
was
laid
the
sacrifice
was
disposed
upon
it
according
to
the
prescribed
rites
the
procession
had
been
formed
round
the
altar
and
the
drums
and
the
trumpets
were
speaking
forth
to
let
all
men
know
that
presently
the
smoke
of
their
prayer
would
be
wafted
up
towards
those
that
sit
in
the
great
places
in
the
heavens
but
then
above
the
noise
of
the
ceremonial
there
came
the
rushing
sound
of
wings
and
from
out
of
the
sky
there
flew
one
of
those
great
featherless
birds
of
a
bigness
such
as
seldom
before
has
been
an
arrow
shot
in
the
eye
or
a
spear
receives
them
oh
all
men
know
what
they
were
taught
as
children
deucalion
but
these
priests
were
unarmed
according
to
the
rubric
which
ordains
that
they
shall
intrust
themselves
completely
to
the
guardianship
of
the
high
gods
during
the
hours
of
sacrifice
the
great
bird
swooped
down
settling
on
the
wood
pyre
and
attacked
the
sacrifice
with
beak
and
talon
my
poor
superior
here
still
strong
in
his
faith
called
loudly
on
our
lord
the
sun
to
lend
power
to
his
arm
and
sprang
up
on
the
altar
with
naught
but
his
teeth
and
his
bare
arms
for
weapons
it
may
be
that
he
expected
a
miracle
he
has
not
spoke
since
poor
soul
in
explanation
but
all
he
met
were
blows
from
leathery
wings
and
rakings
from
talons
which
went
near
to
disembowelling
him
the
bird
brushed
him
away
as
easily
as
we
could
sweep
aside
a
fly
and
there
he
lay
bleeding
on
the
pavement
beside
the
altar
whilst
the
sacrifice
was
torn
and
eaten
in
the
presence
of
all
the
people
and
then
when
the
bird
was
glutted
it
flew
away
again
to
the
and
the
people
gave
no
help
they
cried
out
that
the
thing
was
a
portent
that
our
lord
the
sun
was
a
god
no
longer
if
he
had
not
power
or
thought
to
guard
his
own
sacrifice
and
some
cried
that
there
was
no
god
remaining
now
and
others
would
have
it
that
there
was
a
new
god
come
to
weigh
on
the
country
which
had
chosen
to
take
the
form
of
a
common
bird
but
a
few
began
to
shout
that
phorenice
stood
for
all
the
gods
now
in
atlantis
and
that
cry
was
taken
up
till
the
stones
of
the
great
circle
rang
with
it
some
may
have
made
proclamations
because
they
were
convinced
many
because
the
cry
was
new
and
pleased
them
but
i
am
sure
there
were
not
a
few
who
joined
in
because
it
was
dangerous
to
leave
such
an
outburst
unwelcomed
the
empress
can
be
hard
enough
to
those
who
neglect
to
give
her
the
empress
is
empress
i
said
formally
and
her
name
carries
respect
it
is
not
for
us
to
question
her
i
am
a
priest
said
ro
and
i
speak
as
i
have
been
taught
and
defend
the
faith
as
i
have
been
commanded
whether
there
is
a
faith
any
longer
i
am
beginning
to
doubt
but
anyway
it
yields
a
poor
enough
livelihood
nowadays
there
have
been
no
offerings
at
this
temple
this
five
months
past
and
if
i
had
not
a
few
jars
of
corn
put
by
i
might
have
starved
for
anything
the
pious
of
this
city
cared
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
affair
of
that
sacrifice
is
likely
to
put
new
enthusiasm
into
our
cold
when
did
it
happen
twenty
hours
ago
phorenice
conducts
the
sacrifice
herself
that
has
caused
the
stir
you
spoke
about
the
city
is
in
the
throes
of
getting
ready
one
of
her
then
i
must
ask
you
to
open
the
temple
doors
and
give
me
passage
i
must
go
and
see
this
thing
for
it
is
not
for
me
to
offer
advice
to
one
of
the
seven
said
ro
doubtfully
it
is
but
they
say
that
the
empress
is
not
overpleased
at
your
absence
he
mumbled
i
should
not
like
harm
to
come
in
your
way
deucalion
he
said
aloud
the
future
is
in
the
hands
of
the
most
high
gods
ro
and
i
at
least
believe
that
they
will
deal
out
our
fates
to
each
of
us
as
they
in
their
infinite
wisdom
see
best
though
you
seem
to
have
lost
your
faith
and
now
i
must
be
your
debtor
for
a
passage
out
through
the
doors
plagues
man
it
is
no
use
your
holding
out
your
hand
to
me
i
do
not
own
a
coin
in
all
the
he
mumbled
something
about
force
of
habit
as
he
led
the
way
down
towards
the
door
and
i
responded
tartly
enough
about
the
unpleasantness
of
his
begging
customs
if
it
were
not
for
your
sort
and
your
customs
the
priests
clan
would
not
be
facing
this
crisis
one
must
live
he
grumbled
as
he
pressed
his
levers
and
the
massive
stone
in
the
doorway
swung
ajar
if
you
had
been
a
more
capable
man
i
might
have
seen
the
necessity
said
i
and
passed
into
the
open
and
left
him
i
could
never
bring
myself
to
like
ro
a
motley
crowd
filled
the
street
which
ran
past
the
front
of
this
obscure
temple
and
all
were
hurrying
one
way
with
what
i
had
been
told
it
did
not
take
much
art
to
guess
that
the
great
stone
circle
of
our
lord
the
sun
was
their
mark
and
it
grieved
me
to
think
of
how
many
venerable
centuries
that
great
fane
had
upreared
before
the
weather
and
the
earth
tremors
without
such
profanation
as
it
would
witness
and
also
the
thought
occurred
to
me
was
our
great
lord
above
drawing
this
woman
on
to
her
destruction
would
he
take
some
vast
and
final
act
of
vengeance
when
she
consummated
her
final
sacrilege
but
the
crowd
pressed
on
thrilled
and
excited
and
thinking
little
as
is
a
crowd
s
wont
on
the
deeper
matters
which
lay
beneath
the
bare
spectacle
from
one
quarter
of
the
city
walls
the
din
of
an
attack
from
the
besiegers
made
itself
clearly
heard
from
over
the
house
and
the
temples
and
the
palaces
intervening
but
no
one
heeded
it
they
had
grown
callous
these
townsfolk
to
the
battering
of
rams
and
the
flight
of
and
the
other
emotions
of
a
bombardment
their
nerves
their
hunger
their
desperation
were
strung
to
such
a
pitch
that
little
short
of
an
actual
storm
could
stir
them
into
new
excitement
over
the
siege
all
were
weaponed
the
naked
carried
arms
in
the
hopes
of
meeting
some
one
whom
they
could
overcome
and
rob
those
that
had
a
possession
walked
ready
to
do
a
battle
for
its
ownership
there
was
no
security
no
trust
the
lesson
of
civilisation
had
dropped
away
from
these
common
people
as
mud
is
washed
from
the
feet
by
rain
and
in
their
new
habits
and
their
thoughts
they
had
gone
back
to
the
grade
from
which
savages
like
those
of
europe
have
never
yet
emerged
it
was
a
grim
commentary
on
the
success
of
phorenice
s
rule
the
crowd
merged
me
into
their
ranks
without
question
and
with
them
i
pressed
forward
down
the
winding
streets
once
so
clean
and
trim
now
so
foul
and
men
and
women
had
died
of
hunger
in
these
streets
these
latter
years
and
rotted
where
they
lay
and
we
trod
their
bones
underfoot
as
we
walked
yet
rising
out
of
this
squalor
and
this
misery
were
great
pyramids
and
palaces
the
like
of
which
for
splendour
and
magnificence
had
never
been
seen
before
it
was
a
jarring
admixture
in
time
we
came
to
the
open
space
in
the
centre
of
the
city
which
even
phorenice
had
not
dared
to
encroach
upon
with
her
ambitious
building
schemes
and
stood
on
the
secular
ground
which
surrounds
the
most
ancient
the
most
grand
and
the
breast
of
all
this
world
s
temples
since
the
beginning
of
time
when
man
first
emerged
amongst
the
beasts
our
lord
the
sun
has
always
been
his
chiefest
god
and
legend
says
that
he
raised
this
circle
of
stones
himself
to
be
a
place
where
votaries
should
offer
him
worship
it
is
the
fashion
amongst
us
moderns
not
to
take
these
old
tales
in
a
too
literal
sense
but
for
myself
this
one
satisfies
me
by
our
wits
we
can
lift
blocks
weighing
six
hundred
men
and
set
them
as
the
capstones
of
our
pyramids
but
to
uprear
the
stones
of
that
great
circle
would
be
beyond
all
our
art
and
much
more
would
it
be
impossible
to
transport
them
from
their
distant
quarries
across
the
rugged
mountains
there
were
of
the
stones
alternating
with
spaces
and
set
in
an
accurate
circle
and
across
the
tops
of
them
other
stones
were
set
equally
huge
the
stones
were
undressed
and
rugged
but
the
huge
massiveness
of
them
impressed
the
eye
more
than
all
the
temples
and
daintily
tooled
pyramids
of
our
wondrous
city
and
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
was
that
still
greater
stone
which
formed
the
altar
and
round
which
was
carved
in
the
rude
chiselling
of
the
ancients
the
snake
and
the
outstretched
hand
the
crowd
which
bore
me
on
came
to
a
standstill
before
the
circle
of
stones
to
trespass
beyond
this
is
death
for
the
common
people
and
for
myself
although
i
had
the
right
of
entrance
i
chose
to
stay
where
i
was
for
the
present
unnoticed
amongst
the
mob
and
wait
upon
events
for
long
enough
we
stood
there
our
lord
the
sun
burning
high
and
fiercely
from
the
clear
blue
sky
above
our
heads
the
din
of
the
rebels
attack
upon
the
walls
came
to
us
clearly
even
above
the
gabble
of
the
multitude
but
no
one
gave
attention
to
it
excitement
about
what
was
to
befall
in
the
circle
mastered
every
other
emotion
i
learned
afterways
that
so
pressing
was
the
rebels
attack
and
so
destructive
the
battering
of
their
new
war
engines
that
phorenice
had
gone
off
to
the
walls
first
to
lend
awhile
her
brilliant
skill
for
its
repulse
and
to
put
heart
into
the
defenders
but
as
it
was
the
day
had
burned
out
to
its
middle
and
scorched
us
intolerably
before
the
noise
of
the
drums
and
horns
gave
advertisement
that
the
pageant
had
formed
in
procession
and
of
those
who
waited
in
the
crowd
many
had
fainted
with
exhaustion
and
the
heat
and
not
a
few
had
died
but
life
was
cheap
in
the
city
of
atlantis
now
and
no
one
heeded
the
fallen
nearer
and
nearer
drew
the
drums
and
the
braying
of
the
other
music
and
presently
the
head
of
a
glittering
procession
began
to
arrive
and
dispose
itself
in
the
space
which
had
been
set
apart
many
a
thousand
poor
starving
wretches
sighed
when
they
saw
the
wanton
splendour
of
it
but
these
lords
and
these
courtiers
of
this
new
atlantis
had
no
concern
beyond
their
own
bellies
and
their
own
backs
except
for
their
one
alien
regard
their
simpering
affection
for
phorenice
i
think
though
their
loyalty
for
the
empress
was
real
enough
and
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
since
everything
they
had
came
from
her
lavish
hands
indeed
the
woman
had
a
charm
that
can
not
be
denied
for
when
she
appeared
riding
in
the
golden
castle
where
i
also
had
ridden
on
the
back
of
her
monstrous
shaggy
mammoth
the
starved
sullen
faces
of
the
crowd
brightened
as
though
a
meal
and
sudden
prosperity
had
been
bestowed
upon
them
and
without
a
word
of
command
without
a
trace
of
compulsion
they
burst
into
spontaneous
shouts
of
welcome
she
acknowledged
it
with
a
smile
of
thanks
her
cheeks
were
a
little
flushed
her
movements
quick
her
manner
as
all
well
might
be
seeing
the
horrible
sacrilege
she
had
in
mind
but
she
was
undeniably
lovely
yes
more
adorably
beautiful
than
ever
with
her
present
thrill
of
excitement
and
when
the
stair
was
brought
and
she
walked
down
from
the
mammoth
s
back
to
the
ground
those
near
fell
to
their
knees
and
gave
her
worship
out
of
sheer
fascination
for
her
beauty
and
charm
ylga
the
alone
of
all
that
vast
multitude
round
the
sun
temple
contained
herself
with
her
formal
paces
and
duties
she
looked
pained
and
troubled
it
was
plain
to
see
even
from
the
distance
where
i
stood
that
she
carried
a
heavy
heart
under
the
jewels
of
her
robe
it
was
fitting
too
that
this
should
be
so
though
she
had
been
long
enough
divorced
from
his
care
and
fostered
by
the
empress
ylga
was
a
daughter
of
zaemon
and
he
was
the
chiefest
of
our
lord
the
sun
s
ministers
here
on
earth
she
could
not
forget
her
upbringing
now
at
this
supreme
moment
when
the
highest
of
the
old
gods
was
to
be
formally
defied
and
perhaps
also
having
a
kindness
for
phorenice
she
was
not
a
little
dreadful
of
the
consequences
but
the
empress
had
no
eye
for
one
sad
look
amongst
all
that
sea
of
glowing
faces
boldly
and
proudly
she
strode
out
into
the
circle
as
though
she
had
been
the
duly
appointed
priest
for
the
sacrifice
and
after
her
came
a
knot
of
men
dressed
as
priests
and
bearing
the
victim
some
of
these
were
creatures
of
her
own
and
it
was
easy
to
forgive
mere
ignorant
laymen
won
over
by
the
glamour
of
phorenice
s
presence
but
some
to
their
shame
were
men
born
in
the
priests
clan
and
brought
up
in
the
groves
and
colleges
of
the
sacred
mountain
and
for
their
apostasy
there
could
be
no
palliation
the
wood
had
already
been
stacked
on
the
in
the
due
form
required
by
the
ancient
symbolism
and
the
empress
stood
aside
whilst
those
who
followed
did
what
was
needful
as
they
opened
out
i
saw
that
the
victim
was
one
of
the
small
horses
that
roam
the
plains
a
most
acceptable
sacrifice
they
bound
its
feet
with
metal
gyves
and
put
it
on
the
pyre
where
for
a
while
it
lay
neighing
then
they
stepped
aside
and
left
it
living
here
was
an
innovation
the
false
priests
went
back
to
the
farther
side
of
the
circle
and
phorenice
stood
alone
before
the
altar
she
lifted
up
her
voice
sweet
tuneful
and
carrying
and
though
the
din
of
the
siege
still
came
from
over
the
city
no
ear
there
lost
a
word
of
what
was
spoken
she
raised
her
glance
aloft
and
all
other
eyes
followed
it
the
heaven
was
clear
as
the
deep
sea
a
gorgeous
blue
but
as
the
words
came
from
her
so
a
small
mist
was
born
in
the
sky
wheeling
and
circling
like
a
ball
although
the
day
was
windless
and
rapidly
growing
darker
and
more
compact
so
dense
had
it
become
that
presently
it
threw
a
shadow
on
part
of
the
sacred
circle
and
soothed
it
into
twilight
though
all
without
where
the
people
stood
was
still
garish
day
and
in
the
ball
of
mist
were
little
quick
stabs
and
splashes
of
noiseless
flame
she
spoke
not
in
the
priests
sacred
tongue
though
such
was
her
wicked
cleverness
that
she
may
very
well
have
learned
it
but
in
the
common
speech
of
the
people
so
that
all
who
heard
might
understand
and
she
told
of
her
wondrous
birth
as
she
chose
to
name
it
and
of
the
direct
aid
of
the
most
high
gods
which
had
enabled
her
to
work
so
many
marvels
and
in
the
end
she
lifted
both
of
her
fair
white
arms
towards
the
blackness
above
and
with
her
lovely
face
set
with
the
strain
of
will
she
uttered
her
final
cry
o
my
high
father
the
sun
i
pray
you
now
to
acknowledge
me
as
your
very
daughter
give
this
people
a
sign
that
i
am
indeed
a
child
of
the
gods
and
no
frail
mortal
here
is
sacrifice
unlit
where
mortal
priests
with
their
puny
fires
had
weekly
since
the
foundation
of
this
land
sent
savoury
smoke
towards
the
sky
i
pray
you
send
down
the
heavenly
fire
to
burn
this
beast
here
offered
in
token
that
though
you
still
rule
on
high
you
have
given
me
atlantis
to
be
my
kingdom
and
the
people
of
the
earth
to
be
my
she
broke
off
and
strained
towards
the
sky
her
face
was
contorted
her
limbs
shook
o
mighty
father
she
cried
who
hast
made
me
a
god
and
an
equal
hear
me
hear
me
out
of
the
black
cloud
overhead
there
came
a
blinding
flash
of
light
which
spat
downwards
on
to
the
altar
the
horse
gave
one
shrill
neigh
and
one
convulsion
and
fell
back
dead
flames
crackled
out
from
the
wood
pile
and
the
air
became
rich
with
the
smell
of
burning
flesh
and
lo
in
another
moment
the
cloud
above
had
melted
into
nothingness
and
the
flames
burnt
pale
and
the
smoke
went
up
in
a
thin
blue
spiral
towards
the
deeper
blueness
of
the
sky
phorenice
the
empress
stood
there
before
the
great
stone
and
before
the
snake
and
the
outstretched
hand
of
life
which
were
inscribed
upon
it
flushed
exultant
and
once
more
radiantly
lovely
and
the
knot
of
priests
within
the
circle
and
the
great
mob
of
people
without
fell
to
the
ground
adoring
phorenice
goddess
they
cried
phorenice
goddess
of
all
atlantis
but
for
myself
i
did
not
kneel
i
would
have
no
part
in
this
apostasy
so
i
stood
there
awaiting
fate
a
wooing
a
murmur
quickly
sprang
up
round
me
which
grew
into
shouts
kneel
one
whispered
kneel
sir
or
you
will
be
and
another
cried
kneel
you
without
beard
and
do
obeisance
to
the
only
goddess
or
by
the
old
gods
i
will
make
myself
her
priest
and
butcher
you
and
so
the
shouts
arose
into
a
roar
but
presently
the
word
deucalion
began
to
be
bandied
about
and
there
came
a
moderation
in
the
zeal
of
these
enthusiasts
deucalion
the
man
who
had
left
atlantis
twenty
years
before
to
rule
yucatan
they
might
know
little
enough
about
but
deucalion
who
rode
not
many
days
back
beside
the
empress
in
the
golden
castle
beneath
the
canopy
of
snakes
was
a
person
they
remembered
and
when
they
weighed
up
his
possible
ability
for
vengeance
the
shouts
died
away
from
them
limply
so
when
the
silence
had
grown
again
and
phorenice
turned
and
saw
me
standing
alone
amongst
all
the
prostrate
worshippers
i
stepped
out
from
the
crowd
and
passed
between
two
of
the
great
stones
and
went
across
the
circle
to
where
she
stood
beside
the
altar
i
did
not
prostrate
myself
at
the
prescribed
distance
i
made
the
salutation
which
she
herself
had
ordered
when
she
made
me
her
chief
minister
and
then
hailed
her
with
formal
decorum
as
empress
deucalion
man
of
ice
she
retorted
i
still
adhere
to
the
old
gods
i
was
not
referring
to
that
said
she
and
looked
at
me
with
a
sidelong
smile
but
here
ylga
came
up
to
us
with
a
face
that
was
white
and
a
hand
that
shook
and
made
supplication
for
my
life
if
he
will
not
leave
the
old
gods
yet
she
pleaded
surely
you
will
pardon
him
he
is
a
strong
man
and
does
not
become
a
convert
easily
you
may
change
him
later
but
think
phorenice
he
is
deucalion
and
if
you
slay
him
here
for
this
one
thing
there
is
no
other
man
within
all
the
marches
of
atlantis
who
would
so
worthily
serve
the
empress
took
the
words
from
her
you
slut
she
cried
out
i
have
you
near
me
to
appoint
my
wardrobe
and
carry
my
fan
and
do
you
dare
to
put
a
meddling
finger
on
my
policies
back
with
you
outside
this
circle
or
i
ll
have
you
whipped
ay
and
i
ll
do
more
i
ll
serve
you
as
zaemon
served
my
captain
tarca
shall
i
point
a
finger
at
you
and
smite
your
pretty
skin
with
a
sudden
leprosy
the
girl
bowed
her
shoulders
and
went
away
cowed
and
phorenice
turned
to
me
my
lord
she
said
i
am
like
a
young
bird
in
the
nest
that
has
suddenly
found
its
wings
wings
have
so
many
uses
that
i
am
curious
to
try
them
may
each
new
flight
they
take
be
for
the
good
of
oh
she
said
with
an
i
know
what
you
have
most
at
heart
but
we
will
go
back
to
the
pyramid
and
talk
this
out
at
more
leisure
i
pray
you
now
my
lord
conduct
me
back
to
my
riding
it
appeared
then
that
i
was
to
be
condoned
for
not
offering
her
worship
and
so
putting
public
question
on
her
deification
it
appeared
also
that
ylga
s
interference
was
looked
upon
as
untimely
and
though
i
could
not
understand
the
exact
reasons
for
either
of
these
things
i
accepted
them
as
they
were
seeing
that
they
forwarded
the
scheme
that
zaemon
had
bidden
me
carry
out
so
when
the
empress
lent
me
her
fingers
warm
delicate
fingers
they
were
though
so
skilful
to
grasp
the
weapons
of
war
i
took
them
gravely
and
led
her
out
of
the
great
circle
which
she
had
polluted
with
her
trickeries
i
had
expected
to
see
our
lord
the
sun
take
vengeance
on
the
profanation
whilst
it
was
still
in
act
but
none
had
come
and
i
knew
that
he
would
choose
his
own
good
time
for
retribution
and
appoint
what
instrument
he
thought
best
without
my
raising
a
puny
arm
to
guard
his
mighty
honour
so
i
led
this
lovely
sinful
woman
back
to
the
huge
red
mammoth
which
stood
there
tamely
in
waiting
and
the
smell
of
the
sacrifice
came
after
us
as
we
walked
she
mounted
the
stair
to
the
golden
castle
on
the
shaggy
beast
s
back
and
bade
me
mount
also
and
take
seat
beside
her
but
the
place
of
the
behind
was
empty
and
what
we
said
as
we
rode
back
through
the
streets
there
was
none
to
overhear
she
was
eager
to
know
what
had
befallen
me
after
the
attack
on
the
gate
and
i
told
her
the
tale
laying
stress
on
the
worthiness
of
nais
and
uttering
an
opinion
that
with
care
the
girl
might
be
won
back
to
allegiance
again
only
the
commands
that
zaemon
laid
upon
me
when
he
and
i
spoke
together
in
the
sacred
tongue
did
i
withhold
as
it
is
not
lawful
to
repeat
these
matters
save
only
in
the
high
council
of
the
priests
itself
as
they
sit
before
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
you
seem
to
have
an
unusual
kindliness
for
this
rebel
nais
said
phorenice
she
showed
herself
to
me
as
more
clever
and
thoughtful
than
the
common
ay
she
answered
with
a
sigh
that
i
think
was
real
enough
in
its
way
an
empress
loses
much
that
meaner
woman
gets
as
her
common
in
what
particular
she
misses
the
honest
wooing
of
her
if
you
set
up
for
a
goddess
i
said
pah
i
wish
to
be
no
goddess
to
you
deucalion
that
was
for
the
common
people
it
gives
me
more
power
with
them
it
helps
my
schemes
all
you
seven
higher
priests
know
that
trick
of
calling
down
the
fire
and
it
pleased
me
to
filch
it
can
you
not
be
generous
and
admit
that
a
woman
may
be
as
clever
in
finding
out
these
natural
laws
as
your
musty
elder
priests
remains
that
you
are
nor
empress
either
just
think
that
there
is
a
woman
seated
beside
you
on
this
cushion
deucalion
and
look
upon
her
and
say
what
words
come
first
to
your
lips
have
done
with
ceremonies
and
have
done
with
statecraft
do
you
wish
to
wait
on
as
you
are
till
all
your
manhood
withers
it
is
well
not
to
hurry
unduly
in
these
matters
i
am
with
you
there
yet
who
but
a
fool
watches
a
fruit
grow
ripe
and
then
leaves
it
till
it
is
past
its
prime
i
looked
on
her
glorious
beauty
but
as
i
live
it
left
me
cold
but
i
remembered
the
command
that
had
been
laid
upon
me
and
forced
a
smile
i
may
have
been
fastidious
i
said
but
i
do
not
regret
waiting
this
nor
i
but
i
have
played
my
life
as
a
maid
time
enough
i
am
a
woman
ripe
and
and
the
day
has
come
when
i
should
be
more
than
what
i
have
i
let
my
hand
clench
on
hers
take
me
to
husband
then
and
i
will
be
a
good
man
to
you
but
as
i
am
bidden
speak
to
phorenice
the
woman
now
and
not
to
the
empress
i
offer
fair
warning
that
i
will
be
no
she
looked
at
me
sidelong
i
have
been
master
so
long
that
i
think
it
will
come
as
enjoyment
to
be
mastered
sometimes
no
deucalion
i
promise
that
you
shall
be
no
puppet
indeed
it
would
take
a
lusty
lung
to
do
the
piping
if
you
were
to
dance
against
your
then
as
man
and
wife
we
will
live
together
in
the
royal
pyramid
and
we
will
rule
this
country
with
all
the
wit
that
it
has
pleased
the
high
gods
to
bestow
on
us
these
miserable
differences
shall
be
swept
aside
the
rebels
shall
go
back
to
their
homes
and
hunt
and
fight
the
beasts
in
the
provinces
and
the
priests
clan
shall
be
pacified
phorenice
you
and
i
will
throw
ourselves
brain
and
soul
into
the
government
and
we
will
make
atlantis
rise
as
a
nation
that
shall
once
more
surpass
all
the
world
for
peace
and
petulantly
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
mine
oh
your
conditions
and
your
atlantis
you
carry
a
crudeness
in
these
colonial
manners
of
yours
deucalion
that
palls
on
one
after
the
first
blunt
flavour
has
worn
away
am
i
to
do
all
the
wooing
is
there
no
thrill
of
love
under
all
your
ice
in
truth
i
do
not
know
what
love
may
be
i
have
had
little
enough
speech
with
women
all
these
busy
we
were
a
pair
then
when
you
landed
though
i
have
heard
sighs
and
protestations
from
every
man
that
carries
a
beard
in
all
atlantis
some
of
them
tickled
my
fancy
for
the
day
but
none
of
them
have
moved
me
deeper
no
i
also
have
not
learned
what
this
love
may
be
from
my
own
personal
feelings
but
sir
i
think
that
you
will
teach
me
soon
if
you
go
on
with
your
from
what
i
have
seen
love
is
for
the
poor
and
the
weak
and
for
those
of
flighty
then
i
would
that
another
woman
were
empress
and
that
i
were
some
creature
of
the
gutter
that
a
strong
man
could
pick
up
by
force
and
carry
away
to
his
home
for
sheer
passion
ah
how
i
could
revel
in
it
how
i
could
respond
if
he
caught
my
whim
she
laughed
but
i
should
lead
him
a
sad
life
of
it
if
my
liking
were
not
so
strong
as
we
are
as
we
are
made
and
we
can
not
change
our
inwards
which
move
she
looked
at
me
with
a
sullen
glance
if
i
do
not
change
yours
my
deucalion
there
will
be
more
trouble
brewed
for
this
poor
atlantis
that
you
set
such
store
upon
there
will
be
ill
doings
in
this
coming
household
of
ours
if
my
love
grows
for
you
and
yours
remains
still
i
believe
she
would
have
had
me
fondle
her
there
in
the
golden
castle
on
the
mammoth
s
shabby
back
before
the
city
streets
packed
with
curious
people
she
had
little
enough
appetite
for
privacy
at
any
time
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
do
it
the
gods
know
i
was
earnest
enough
about
my
task
and
they
know
also
how
it
repelled
me
but
i
was
a
true
priest
that
day
and
i
had
put
away
all
personal
liking
to
carry
out
the
commands
which
the
council
had
laid
upon
me
if
i
had
known
how
to
set
about
it
i
would
have
fallen
in
with
her
mood
but
where
any
of
those
shallow
bedizened
triflers
about
the
court
would
have
been
glibly
in
his
element
i
stuck
for
lack
of
a
dozen
words
there
was
no
help
for
it
but
to
leave
all
save
what
i
actually
felt
unsaid
diplomacy
i
was
trained
in
and
on
most
matters
i
had
a
glib
enough
tongue
but
to
palter
with
women
was
a
lightness
i
had
always
neglected
and
if
i
had
invented
pretty
speeches
out
of
my
clumsy
inexperience
phorenice
would
have
seen
through
the
fraud
on
the
instant
she
had
been
nurtured
during
these
years
of
her
rule
on
a
pap
of
these
silly
protestations
and
could
weigh
their
value
with
an
expert
s
exactness
nor
was
it
a
case
where
honest
confession
would
have
served
my
purpose
better
if
i
had
put
my
position
to
her
in
plain
words
it
would
have
made
relations
worse
and
so
perforce
i
had
to
hold
my
tongue
and
submit
to
be
considered
a
clown
i
had
always
heard
she
said
that
you
colonists
in
yucatan
were
far
ahead
of
those
in
egypt
in
all
the
arts
and
graces
but
you
sir
do
small
credit
to
your
why
i
have
had
gentry
from
the
nile
come
here
and
you
might
almost
think
they
had
never
left
their
native
they
must
have
made
great
strides
this
last
twenty
years
then
when
last
i
was
sent
to
egypt
to
report
the
blacks
were
clearly
masters
of
the
land
and
our
people
lived
there
only
on
sufferance
their
pyramids
were
puny
and
their
cities
nothing
more
than
oh
she
said
mockingly
they
are
mere
exiles
still
but
they
remember
their
manners
my
poor
face
seemed
to
please
them
at
least
they
all
went
into
raptures
over
it
and
for
ten
pleasant
words
one
of
them
cut
off
his
own
right
hand
we
made
the
bargain
my
egyptian
gallant
and
i
and
the
hand
lies
dried
on
some
shelf
in
my
apartment
as
a
pleasant
but
here
by
a
lucky
chance
for
me
an
incident
occurred
which
saved
me
from
further
baiting
the
rebels
outside
the
walls
were
conducting
their
day
s
attack
with
vigour
and
some
intelligence
more
than
once
during
our
procession
the
lighter
missiles
from
their
war
engines
had
sung
up
through
the
air
and
split
against
a
building
and
thrown
splinters
which
wounded
those
who
thronged
the
streets
still
there
had
been
nothing
to
ruffle
the
nerves
of
any
one
at
all
used
to
the
haps
of
warfare
or
in
any
way
to
hinder
our
courtship
but
presently
it
seems
they
stopped
hurling
stones
from
their
war
engines
and
took
to
loading
them
with
carcases
of
wood
lined
with
the
throwing
fire
now
against
stone
buildings
these
did
little
harm
save
only
that
they
scorched
horribly
any
poor
wretch
that
was
within
splash
of
them
when
they
burst
but
when
they
fell
upon
the
rude
wooden
booths
and
rush
shelters
of
the
poorer
folk
they
set
them
ablaze
instantly
there
was
no
putting
out
these
fires
these
things
also
would
have
given
to
either
phorenice
or
myself
little
enough
of
concern
as
they
are
the
trivial
and
common
incidents
of
every
siege
but
the
mammoth
on
which
we
rode
had
not
been
so
properly
schooled
when
the
first
blue
whiff
of
smoke
came
to
us
down
the
windings
of
the
street
the
huge
red
beast
hoisted
its
trunk
and
began
to
sway
its
head
uneasily
when
the
smoke
drifts
grew
more
dense
and
here
and
there
a
tongue
of
flame
showed
pale
beneath
the
sunshine
it
stopped
abruptly
and
began
to
trumpet
the
guards
who
led
it
tugged
manfully
at
the
chains
which
hung
from
the
jagged
metal
collar
round
its
neck
so
that
the
spikes
ran
deep
into
its
flesh
and
reminded
it
keenly
of
its
bondage
but
the
beast
s
terror
at
the
fire
which
was
native
to
its
constitution
mastered
all
its
habits
of
obedience
from
time
unknown
men
have
hunted
the
mammoth
in
the
savage
ground
and
the
mammoth
has
hunted
men
and
the
men
have
always
used
fire
as
a
shield
and
mammoths
have
learned
to
dread
fire
as
the
most
dangerous
of
all
enemies
phorenice
s
brow
began
to
darken
as
the
great
beast
grew
more
restive
and
she
shook
her
red
curls
viciously
some
one
shall
lose
a
head
for
this
blundering
said
she
i
ordered
to
have
this
beast
trained
to
stand
indifferent
to
drums
shouting
arrows
stones
and
fire
and
the
trainers
assured
me
that
all
was
done
and
brought
i
slipped
my
girdle
here
i
said
quick
let
me
lower
you
to
the
she
turned
on
me
with
a
gleam
are
you
afraid
for
my
neck
then
deucalion
i
have
no
mind
to
be
bereaved
before
i
have
tasted
my
wedded
pish
there
is
little
enough
of
danger
i
will
stay
and
ride
it
out
i
am
not
one
of
your
nervous
women
sir
but
go
you
if
you
there
is
little
enough
chance
of
that
blood
flowed
from
the
mammoth
s
neck
where
the
spikes
of
the
collar
tore
it
and
with
each
drop
so
did
the
tameness
seem
to
ooze
out
from
it
also
with
wild
squeals
and
trumpetings
it
turned
and
charged
viciously
down
the
way
it
had
come
scattering
like
straws
the
spearmen
who
tried
to
stop
it
and
mowing
a
great
swath
through
the
crowd
with
its
monstrous
progress
many
must
have
been
trodden
under
foot
many
killed
by
its
murderous
trunk
but
only
their
cries
came
to
us
the
golden
castle
with
its
canopy
of
royal
snakes
was
swayed
and
tossed
so
that
we
two
occupants
had
much
ado
not
to
be
shot
off
like
stones
from
a
catapult
but
i
took
a
brace
with
my
feet
against
the
front
and
one
arm
around
a
pillar
and
clapped
the
spare
arm
round
phorenice
so
as
to
offer
myself
to
her
as
a
cushion
she
lay
there
contentedly
enough
with
her
lovely
face
just
beneath
my
chin
and
the
faint
scent
of
her
hair
coming
in
to
me
with
every
breath
i
took
and
the
mammoth
charged
madly
on
through
the
narrow
streets
we
had
outstripped
the
taint
of
smoke
and
the
original
cause
of
fear
but
the
beast
seemed
to
have
forgotten
everything
in
its
mad
panic
it
held
furiously
on
with
enormous
strides
carrying
its
trunk
aloft
and
deafening
us
with
its
screams
and
trumpetings
we
left
behind
us
quickly
all
those
who
had
trod
in
that
glittering
pageant
and
we
were
carried
helplessly
on
through
the
wards
of
the
city
the
beast
was
utterly
beyond
all
control
so
great
was
its
pace
that
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
try
and
cling
on
to
the
castle
up
there
we
were
beyond
its
reach
to
have
leapt
off
even
if
we
had
avoided
having
brains
dashed
out
or
limbs
smashed
by
the
fall
would
have
been
to
put
ourselves
at
once
at
a
frightful
disadvantage
the
mammoth
would
have
scented
us
immediately
and
turned
as
is
the
custom
of
these
beasts
and
we
should
have
been
trampled
into
a
pulp
in
a
dozen
seconds
the
thought
came
to
me
that
here
was
the
high
god
s
answer
to
phorenice
s
sacrilege
the
mammoth
was
appointed
to
carry
out
their
vengeance
by
dashing
her
to
pieces
and
i
their
priest
was
to
be
human
witness
that
justice
had
been
done
but
no
direct
revelation
had
been
given
me
on
this
matter
and
so
i
took
no
initiative
but
hung
on
to
the
swaying
castle
and
held
the
empress
against
bruises
in
my
arms
there
was
no
guiding
the
brute
in
its
insanity
of
madness
it
doubled
many
times
upon
its
course
the
windings
of
the
streets
confusing
it
but
by
degrees
we
left
the
large
palaces
and
pyramids
behind
and
got
amongst
the
quarters
of
artisans
where
weavers
and
smiths
gaped
at
us
from
their
doors
as
we
thundered
past
and
then
we
came
upon
the
merchants
quarters
where
men
live
over
their
storehouses
that
do
traffic
with
the
people
over
seas
and
then
down
an
open
space
there
glittered
before
us
a
mirror
of
water
now
here
thought
i
this
mad
beast
will
come
to
sudden
stop
and
as
like
as
not
will
swerve
round
sharply
and
charge
back
again
towards
the
heart
of
the
and
i
braced
myself
to
withstand
the
shock
and
took
fresh
grip
upon
the
woman
who
lay
against
my
breast
but
with
louder
screams
and
wilder
trumpetings
the
mammoth
held
straight
on
and
presently
came
to
the
harbour
s
edge
and
sent
the
spray
sparkling
in
sheets
amongst
the
sunshine
as
it
went
with
its
clumsy
gait
into
the
water
but
at
this
point
the
pace
was
very
quickly
slackened
the
great
sewers
which
science
devised
for
the
health
of
the
city
in
the
old
king
s
time
vomit
their
drainings
into
this
part
of
the
harbour
and
the
solid
matter
which
they
carry
is
quickly
deposited
as
an
impalpable
sludge
into
this
the
huge
beast
began
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
before
it
could
halt
in
its
rush
and
when
with
frightened
bellowings
it
had
come
to
a
stop
it
was
bogged
irretrievably
madly
it
struggled
wildly
it
screamed
and
trumpeted
the
and
the
slime
were
churned
into
one
stinking
compost
and
the
golden
castle
in
which
we
clung
lurched
so
wildly
that
we
were
torn
from
it
and
shot
far
away
into
the
water
still
there
of
course
we
were
safe
and
i
was
pleased
enough
to
be
rid
of
the
bumpings
phorenice
laughed
as
she
swam
you
handle
yourself
like
a
sore
man
deucalion
i
owe
you
something
for
lending
me
the
cushion
of
your
body
by
my
face
there
s
more
of
the
gallant
about
you
when
it
comes
to
the
test
than
one
would
guess
to
hear
you
talk
how
did
you
like
the
ride
sir
i
warrant
it
came
to
you
as
a
new
i
d
liefer
have
pish
man
you
ll
never
be
a
courtier
you
should
have
sworn
that
with
me
in
your
arms
you
could
have
wished
the
bumping
had
gone
on
for
ever
ho
the
boat
there
hold
your
arrows
deucalion
hail
me
those
fools
in
that
boat
tell
them
that
if
they
hurt
so
much
as
a
hair
of
my
mammoth
i
ll
kill
them
all
by
torture
he
ll
exhaust
himself
directly
and
when
his
flurry
s
done
we
ll
leave
him
where
he
is
to
consider
his
evil
ways
for
a
day
or
so
and
then
haul
him
out
with
windlasses
and
tame
him
afresh
pho
i
could
not
feel
myself
to
be
phorenice
if
i
had
no
fine
red
shaggy
mammoth
to
take
me
out
for
my
the
boat
was
a
galley
which
was
churning
up
from
the
farther
side
of
the
harbour
as
hard
as
whips
could
make
oars
drive
her
but
at
the
sound
of
my
shouts
the
soldiers
on
her
foredeck
stopped
their
arrowshots
and
the
steersman
swerved
her
off
on
a
new
course
to
pick
us
up
till
then
we
had
been
swimming
leisurely
across
an
angle
of
the
harbour
so
as
to
avoid
landing
where
the
sewers
outpoured
but
we
stopped
now
treading
the
water
and
were
helped
over
the
side
by
most
respectful
hands
the
galley
belonged
to
the
captain
of
the
port
a
mincing
figure
of
a
mariner
whose
highest
appetite
in
life
was
to
lick
the
feet
of
the
great
and
he
began
to
fawn
and
prostrate
himself
at
once
and
to
wish
that
his
eyes
had
been
blinded
before
he
saw
the
empress
in
such
deadly
peril
the
peril
may
pass
said
she
it
s
nothing
mortal
that
will
ever
kill
me
but
i
have
spoiled
my
pretty
clothes
and
shed
a
jewel
or
two
and
that
s
annoying
enough
as
you
say
good
the
silly
fellow
repeated
a
wish
that
he
might
be
blinded
before
the
empress
was
ever
put
to
such
discomfort
again
but
it
seemed
she
could
be
cloyed
with
flattery
if
you
are
tired
of
your
eyes
said
she
let
me
tell
you
that
you
have
gone
the
way
to
have
them
plucked
out
from
their
sockets
kill
my
mammoth
would
you
because
he
has
shown
himself
a
trifle
frolicsome
you
and
your
sort
want
more
education
my
man
i
shall
have
to
teach
you
that
and
such
small
creatures
are
very
easy
to
come
by
and
very
small
value
when
got
but
that
my
mammoth
is
mine
mine
do
you
understand
the
property
of
goddess
phorenice
and
as
such
is
the
abased
himself
before
her
i
am
an
ignorant
fellow
said
he
and
heaven
was
robbed
of
its
brightest
ornament
when
phorenice
came
down
to
atlantis
but
if
reparation
is
permitted
me
i
have
two
prisoners
in
the
cabin
of
the
boat
here
who
shall
be
sacrificed
to
the
mammoth
forthwith
doubtless
it
would
please
him
to
make
sport
with
them
and
spill
out
the
last
lees
of
his
rage
upon
their
prisoners
you
ve
got
have
you
how
taken
under
cover
of
last
night
they
were
trying
to
pass
in
between
the
two
forts
which
guard
the
harbour
mouth
but
their
boat
fouled
the
chain
and
by
the
light
of
the
torches
the
sentries
spied
them
they
were
caught
with
ropes
and
put
in
a
dungeon
there
is
an
order
not
to
abuse
prisoners
before
they
have
been
brought
before
a
judgment
it
was
my
order
did
these
prisoners
offer
to
buy
their
lives
with
news
the
man
has
not
spoken
indeed
i
think
he
got
his
in
being
taken
the
woman
fought
like
a
cat
also
so
they
said
in
the
fort
but
she
was
caught
without
hurt
she
says
she
has
got
nothing
that
would
be
of
use
to
tell
she
says
she
has
tired
of
living
like
a
savage
outside
the
city
and
moreover
that
inside
there
is
a
man
for
whose
nearness
she
craves
most
tut
said
phorenice
is
this
a
romance
we
have
swum
to
you
see
what
affectionate
creatures
we
women
are
the
galley
was
brought
up
against
the
royal
quay
and
made
fast
to
its
golden
rings
i
handed
the
empress
ashore
but
she
turned
again
and
faced
the
boat
her
garments
still
yielding
up
a
slender
drip
of
produce
your
woman
prisoner
master
captain
and
let
us
see
whether
she
is
a
runaway
wife
or
a
lovesick
girl
mad
after
her
sweetheart
then
i
will
deliver
judgment
on
her
and
as
like
as
not
will
surprise
you
all
with
my
clemency
i
am
in
a
mood
for
tender
romance
the
went
into
the
little
hutch
of
a
cabin
with
a
white
face
it
was
plain
that
phorenice
s
pleasantries
scared
him
the
man
appears
to
be
dead
your
majesty
i
see
that
his
wounds
bring
out
the
woman
you
fool
i
asked
for
her
keep
your
carrion
where
it
i
saw
the
fellow
stoop
for
his
knife
to
cut
a
lashing
and
presently
who
should
he
bring
out
to
the
daylight
but
the
girl
i
had
saved
from
the
in
the
circus
and
who
had
so
strangely
drawn
me
to
her
during
the
hours
that
we
had
spent
afterwards
in
companionship
it
was
clear
too
that
the
empress
recognised
her
also
indeed
she
made
no
secret
about
the
matter
addressing
her
by
name
and
mockingly
making
inquiries
about
the
menage
of
the
rebels
and
the
success
of
the
prisoner
s
amours
this
good
tells
me
that
you
made
a
most
valiant
attempt
to
return
nais
and
for
an
excuse
you
told
that
it
was
your
love
for
some
man
in
the
city
here
which
drew
you
come
now
we
are
willing
to
overlook
much
of
your
faults
if
you
will
give
us
a
reasonable
chance
point
me
out
your
man
and
if
he
is
a
proper
fellow
i
will
see
that
he
weds
you
honestly
yes
and
i
will
do
more
for
you
nais
since
this
day
brings
me
to
a
husband
seeing
that
all
your
estate
is
confiscate
as
a
penalty
for
your
late
rebellion
i
will
charge
myself
with
your
dowry
and
give
it
back
to
you
so
come
name
me
the
the
girl
looked
at
her
with
a
sullen
brow
i
spoke
a
lie
she
said
there
is
no
i
tried
myself
to
give
her
advocacy
the
lady
doubtless
spoke
what
came
to
her
lips
when
a
woman
is
in
the
grip
of
a
rude
soldiery
any
excuse
which
can
save
her
for
the
moment
must
serve
for
myself
i
should
think
it
like
enough
that
she
would
confess
to
having
come
back
to
her
old
allegiance
if
she
were
sir
said
the
empress
keep
your
peace
any
interest
you
may
show
in
this
matter
will
go
far
to
offend
me
you
have
spoken
of
nais
in
your
narrative
before
and
although
your
tongue
was
shrewd
and
you
did
not
say
much
i
am
a
woman
and
i
could
read
between
the
lines
now
regard
my
rebel
i
have
no
wish
to
be
unduly
hard
upon
you
though
once
you
were
my
and
so
your
running
away
to
these
malcontents
who
beat
their
heads
against
my
city
walls
is
all
the
more
naughty
but
you
must
meet
me
halfway
you
must
give
an
excuse
for
leniency
point
me
out
the
man
you
would
wed
and
he
shall
be
your
husband
there
is
no
then
name
me
one
at
random
why
my
pretty
nais
not
ten
months
ago
there
were
a
score
who
would
have
leaped
at
the
chance
of
having
you
for
a
wife
drop
your
coyness
girl
and
name
me
one
of
those
i
warrant
you
that
i
will
be
your
ambassadress
and
will
put
the
matter
to
him
with
such
delicacy
that
he
will
not
make
you
blush
by
the
prisoner
moistened
her
lips
i
am
a
maiden
and
i
have
a
maiden
s
modesty
i
will
die
as
you
choose
but
i
will
not
do
this
well
i
am
a
maiden
too
and
though
because
i
am
empress
also
questions
of
state
have
to
stand
before
questions
of
my
private
modesty
i
can
have
a
sympathy
for
yours
although
in
truth
it
did
not
obtrude
unduly
when
you
were
my
nais
no
come
to
think
of
it
you
liked
a
tender
glance
and
a
pretty
phrase
as
well
as
any
when
you
were
you
have
grown
wild
and
shy
amongst
these
savage
rebels
but
i
will
not
punish
you
for
that
let
me
call
your
favourites
to
memory
now
there
was
tarca
of
course
but
tarca
had
a
difference
with
that
father
of
yours
and
wears
a
leprosy
on
half
his
face
instead
of
that
beard
he
used
to
trim
so
finely
and
then
there
is
tatho
but
tatho
is
away
overseas
eron
too
you
liked
once
but
he
lost
an
arm
in
fighting
t
other
day
and
i
would
not
marry
you
to
less
than
a
whole
man
ah
by
my
face
i
have
it
the
dainty
exquisite
rota
he
is
the
husband
how
well
i
remember
the
way
he
used
to
dress
in
a
change
of
garb
each
day
to
catch
your
proud
fancy
girl
well
you
shall
have
rota
he
shall
lead
you
to
wife
before
this
hour
again
the
prisoner
moistened
her
lips
i
will
not
have
rota
and
spare
me
the
others
i
know
why
you
mock
me
then
there
are
three
of
us
here
who
share
one
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
gods
who
ever
saw
the
like
of
phorenice
s
eyes
and
who
ever
saw
them
lit
with
such
fire
as
burned
within
them
then
my
lord
you
are
marrying
me
for
policy
i
am
marrying
you
for
policy
and
for
another
reason
which
has
grown
stronger
of
late
and
which
you
may
guess
at
do
you
wish
still
to
carry
out
the
match
i
looked
once
at
nais
and
then
i
looked
steadily
back
to
phorenice
the
command
given
by
the
mouth
of
zaemon
from
the
high
council
of
the
sacred
mountain
had
to
outweigh
all
else
and
i
answered
that
such
was
my
desire
then
said
she
glowering
at
me
with
her
eyes
you
shall
build
me
up
the
pretty
body
of
nais
beneath
a
throne
of
granite
as
a
wedding
gift
and
you
shall
do
it
too
with
your
own
proper
hands
my
deucalion
whilst
i
watch
your
and
to
nais
she
turned
with
a
cruel
smile
you
lied
to
me
my
girl
and
you
spoke
truth
to
the
soldiers
in
the
harbour
forts
there
is
a
man
here
in
the
city
you
came
after
and
he
is
the
one
man
you
may
not
have
because
you
know
me
well
and
my
methods
very
thoroughly
your
love
for
him
must
be
very
deep
or
you
would
not
have
come
and
so
being
here
you
shall
be
put
beyond
mischief
s
reach
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
see
luxury
in
fostering
rivals
you
came
for
attention
at
the
hands
of
deucalion
by
my
face
you
shall
have
it
i
will
watch
myself
whilst
he
builds
you
up
an
affair
with
the
barbarous
fishers
so
this
mighty
empress
chose
to
be
jealous
of
a
mere
woman
prisoner
now
my
mind
has
been
trained
to
work
with
a
soldierly
quickness
in
these
moments
of
stress
and
i
decided
on
my
proper
course
on
the
instant
the
words
had
left
her
lips
i
was
sacrificing
myself
for
atlantis
by
order
of
the
high
council
of
the
priests
and
if
needful
nais
must
be
sacrificed
also
although
in
the
same
flash
a
scheme
came
to
me
for
saving
her
so
i
bowed
gravely
before
the
empress
and
said
i
in
this
and
in
all
other
things
where
a
mere
human
hand
is
potent
i
will
carry
out
your
wishes
and
she
on
her
part
patted
my
arm
and
fresh
waves
of
feeling
welled
up
from
the
depths
of
her
wondrous
eyes
surely
the
gods
won
for
her
half
her
schemes
and
half
her
battles
when
they
gave
phorenice
her
shape
and
her
voice
and
the
matters
which
lay
within
the
outlines
of
her
face
by
this
time
the
merchants
and
the
other
dwellers
adjacent
to
this
part
of
the
harbour
where
the
royal
quay
stands
had
come
down
offering
changes
of
raiment
and
houses
to
retire
into
phorenice
was
all
graciousness
and
though
it
was
little
enough
i
cared
for
mere
wetness
of
my
coat
still
that
part
of
the
harbour
into
which
we
had
been
thrown
by
the
mammoth
was
not
over
savoury
and
i
was
glad
enough
to
follow
her
example
for
myself
i
said
no
further
word
to
nais
and
refrained
even
from
giving
her
a
glance
of
farewell
but
a
small
sop
like
this
was
no
meal
for
phorenice
and
she
gave
the
strict
orders
for
the
guarding
of
his
prisoner
before
she
left
him
at
the
house
into
which
i
was
ushered
they
gave
me
a
bath
and
i
eased
my
host
of
the
plainest
garment
in
his
store
and
he
was
pleased
enough
at
getting
off
so
cheaply
but
i
had
an
hour
to
spend
outside
on
the
pavement
listening
to
the
distant
din
of
bombardment
before
phorenice
came
out
to
me
again
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
some
grim
amusement
at
the
face
of
the
merchant
who
followed
the
fellow
was
clearly
ruined
he
had
a
store
of
jewels
and
gauds
of
the
most
costly
kind
which
were
only
in
fraction
his
own
seeing
that
he
had
bought
them
as
the
custom
is
in
partnership
with
other
merchants
these
had
pleased
phorenice
s
eye
and
so
she
had
taken
all
and
disposed
them
on
her
person
are
they
not
pretty
said
she
showing
them
to
me
see
how
they
flash
under
the
sun
i
am
quite
glad
now
deucalion
that
the
mammoth
gave
us
that
furious
ride
and
that
spill
since
it
has
brought
me
such
a
bonny
present
you
may
tell
the
fellow
here
that
some
day
when
he
has
earned
some
more
i
will
come
and
be
his
guest
again
ah
they
have
brought
us
litters
i
see
well
send
one
away
and
do
you
share
mine
with
me
sir
we
must
play
at
being
lovers
even
if
love
is
a
matter
which
will
come
to
us
both
with
more
certainty
no
do
not
order
more
bearers
my
own
slaves
will
carry
us
handily
enough
i
am
glad
you
are
not
one
of
your
gross
overfed
men
deucalion
i
am
small
and
slim
myself
and
i
do
not
want
to
be
husbanded
by
a
man
who
will
overshadow
back
to
the
royal
pyramid
i
asked
no
nor
to
the
walls
i
neither
wish
to
fight
nor
to
sit
as
empress
sir
as
i
have
told
you
before
it
is
my
whim
to
be
phorenice
the
maiden
for
a
few
hours
and
if
some
one
i
wot
of
would
woo
me
now
as
other
maidens
are
wooed
i
should
esteem
it
a
luxury
bid
the
slaves
carry
us
round
the
harbour
s
rim
and
give
word
to
these
starers
that
if
they
follow
i
will
call
down
fire
upon
them
as
i
did
upon
the
now
i
had
seen
something
of
the
unruliness
of
the
streets
myself
and
i
had
gathered
a
hint
also
from
the
officer
at
the
gate
of
the
royal
pyramid
that
night
of
phorenice
s
welcoming
banquet
but
as
whatever
there
was
in
the
matter
must
be
common
knowledge
to
the
empress
i
did
not
bring
it
to
her
memory
then
so
i
dismissed
the
guard
which
had
come
up
and
drove
away
with
a
few
sharp
words
the
throng
of
gaping
sightseers
who
always
silly
creatures
must
needs
come
to
stare
at
their
betters
and
then
i
sat
in
the
litter
in
the
place
where
i
was
invited
and
the
bearers
put
their
heads
to
the
pole
they
swung
away
with
us
along
the
wide
pavement
which
runs
between
the
houses
of
the
merchants
and
the
mariner
folk
and
the
dimpling
waters
of
the
harbour
and
i
thought
somewhat
sadly
of
the
few
ships
that
floated
on
that
splendid
basin
now
and
of
the
few
evidences
of
business
that
showed
themselves
on
the
quays
time
was
when
the
ships
were
berthed
so
close
that
many
had
to
wait
in
the
estuary
outside
the
walls
and
memorials
had
been
sent
to
the
king
that
the
port
should
be
doubled
in
size
to
hold
the
glut
of
trade
and
that
too
in
the
old
days
of
oar
and
sail
when
machines
drawing
power
from
our
lord
the
sun
were
but
rarely
used
to
help
a
vessel
speedily
along
her
course
the
egypt
voyage
and
a
return
was
a
matter
of
a
year
then
as
against
a
brace
of
months
now
and
of
three
ships
that
set
out
one
at
least
could
be
reckoned
upon
succumbing
to
the
dangers
of
the
wide
waters
and
the
terrible
beasts
that
haunt
them
but
in
those
old
days
trade
roared
with
lusty
life
and
was
ever
growing
wider
and
more
heavy
your
merchant
then
was
a
portly
man
and
gave
generously
to
the
gods
but
now
all
the
world
seemed
to
be
in
arms
and
moreover
trade
was
vulgar
your
merchant
if
he
was
a
man
of
substance
forgot
his
merchandise
swore
that
chaffering
was
more
indelicate
than
blasphemy
and
curled
his
beard
after
the
new
fashion
and
became
a
courtier
where
his
father
had
spent
anxious
days
with
cargo
tally
and
the
son
wasted
hours
in
directing
sewing
men
as
they
adorned
a
coat
and
nights
in
vapouring
at
a
banquet
of
the
smaller
merchants
who
had
no
substance
laid
by
taxes
and
the
constant
bickerings
of
war
had
wellnigh
ground
them
into
starvation
besides
with
the
country
in
constant
uproar
there
were
few
markets
left
for
most
merchandise
nor
was
there
aught
made
now
which
could
be
carried
abroad
if
your
weaver
is
pressed
as
a
man
he
does
not
make
cloth
and
if
your
farmer
is
playing
at
rebellion
he
does
not
buy
slaves
to
till
his
fields
indeed
they
told
me
that
a
month
before
my
return
as
fine
a
cargo
of
slaves
had
been
brought
into
harbour
as
ever
came
out
of
europe
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
set
them
ashore
across
the
estuary
and
leave
them
free
to
starve
or
live
in
the
wild
ground
there
as
they
chose
there
was
no
man
in
all
atlantis
who
would
hold
so
much
as
one
more
slave
as
a
gift
but
though
i
was
grieved
at
this
falling
away
all
schemes
for
remedy
would
be
for
afterwards
it
would
only
make
ill
worse
to
speak
of
it
as
we
rode
together
in
the
litter
i
was
growing
to
know
phorenice
s
moods
enough
for
that
still
i
think
that
she
too
had
studied
mine
and
did
her
best
to
interest
me
between
her
bursts
of
trifling
we
went
out
to
where
the
westernmost
harbour
wall
joins
the
land
and
there
the
panting
bearers
set
us
down
she
led
me
into
a
little
house
of
stone
which
stood
by
itself
built
out
on
a
promontory
where
there
is
a
constant
run
of
tide
and
when
we
had
been
given
admittance
after
much
unbarring
she
showed
me
her
new
gold
collectors
in
the
dry
knowledge
taught
in
the
colleges
and
groves
of
the
sacred
mountain
it
had
been
a
common
fact
to
us
that
the
metal
gold
was
present
in
a
dissolved
state
in
all
sea
water
but
of
plans
for
dragging
it
forth
into
yellow
hardness
none
had
ever
been
discussed
but
here
this
upstart
of
an
empress
had
stumbled
upon
the
trick
as
though
it
had
been
written
in
a
book
she
patted
my
arm
laughingly
as
i
stared
curiously
round
the
place
i
tell
all
others
in
atlantis
that
only
the
gods
have
this
secret
said
she
and
that
they
gave
it
to
me
as
one
of
themselves
but
i
am
no
goddess
to
you
am
i
deucalion
and
by
my
face
i
have
no
other
explanation
of
how
this
plan
was
invented
we
ll
suppose
i
must
have
dreamed
it
look
the
sluices
in
through
that
culvert
and
passes
over
these
rough
metal
plates
set
in
the
floor
and
then
flows
out
again
yonder
in
its
natural
course
you
see
the
yellow
metal
caught
in
the
ridges
of
the
plates
that
is
gold
and
my
fellows
here
melt
it
with
fire
into
bars
and
take
it
to
my
smith
s
in
the
city
the
tides
vary
constantly
as
you
priests
know
well
as
the
quiet
moon
draws
them
and
it
does
not
take
much
figuring
to
know
how
much
of
the
sea
passes
through
these
culverts
in
a
month
and
how
much
gold
to
a
grain
should
be
caught
in
the
plates
my
fellows
here
at
first
thought
to
cheat
me
but
i
towed
two
of
them
in
the
water
once
behind
a
galley
till
the
cannibal
fish
ate
them
and
since
then
the
others
have
given
me
credit
for
for
what
do
you
think
more
i
suppose
it
is
that
but
i
am
letting
you
see
how
it
is
done
just
have
the
head
to
work
out
a
little
sum
and
see
what
an
effect
can
be
gained
you
will
be
a
god
yet
yourself
deucalion
with
these
silly
atlanteans
if
only
you
will
use
your
wit
and
was
she
laughing
at
me
was
she
in
earnest
i
could
not
tell
sometimes
she
pointed
out
that
her
success
and
triumphs
were
merely
the
reward
of
thought
and
brilliancy
and
next
moment
she
gave
me
some
impossible
explanation
and
left
me
to
deduce
that
she
must
be
more
than
mortal
or
the
thing
could
never
have
been
found
in
good
truth
this
little
woman
with
her
supple
mind
and
her
supple
body
mystified
me
more
and
more
the
longer
i
stayed
by
her
side
and
more
and
more
despairing
did
i
grow
that
atlantis
could
ever
be
restored
by
my
agency
to
peace
and
the
ancient
gods
even
after
i
had
carried
out
the
commands
of
the
high
council
and
taken
her
to
wife
only
one
plan
seemed
humanly
possible
and
that
was
to
curb
her
further
mischievousness
by
death
and
then
leave
the
wretched
country
naturally
to
recover
it
was
just
a
and
the
thing
was
done
yet
the
very
idea
of
this
revolted
me
and
when
the
desperate
thought
came
to
my
mind
which
it
did
ever
and
anon
i
hugged
to
myself
the
answer
that
if
it
were
fitting
to
do
this
thing
the
high
gods
in
their
infinite
wisdom
would
surely
have
put
definite
commands
upon
me
for
its
carrying
out
yet
such
was
the
fascination
of
phorenice
that
when
presently
we
left
her
gold
collectors
and
stumbled
into
such
peril
that
a
little
withholding
of
my
hand
would
have
gained
her
a
passage
to
the
nether
gods
i
found
myself
fighting
when
she
called
upon
me
as
seldom
i
have
fought
before
and
though
of
course
some
blame
for
this
must
be
laid
upon
that
lust
of
battle
which
thrills
even
the
coldest
of
us
when
blows
begin
to
whistle
and
start
to
ring
there
is
no
doubt
also
that
the
pleasure
of
protecting
phorenice
and
the
distaste
for
seeing
her
pulled
down
by
those
rude
uncouth
fishers
put
special
nerve
and
vehemence
into
my
blows
the
cause
of
the
matter
was
the
unrest
and
the
prevalency
to
street
violence
which
i
have
spoken
of
above
and
the
desperate
poverty
of
the
common
people
which
led
them
to
take
any
risk
if
it
showed
them
a
chance
of
winning
the
wherewithal
to
purchase
a
meal
we
had
once
more
mounted
the
litter
and
once
more
the
bearers
with
their
heads
beneath
the
pole
bore
us
on
at
their
accustomed
swinging
trot
phorenice
was
telling
me
about
her
new
supplies
of
gold
she
had
made
fresh
sumptuary
laws
it
appeared
in
the
old
days
said
she
when
yellow
gold
was
tediously
dredged
up
grain
by
grain
from
river
gravels
in
the
dangerous
lands
a
quill
full
would
cost
a
rich
man
s
savings
and
so
none
but
those
whose
high
station
fitted
them
to
be
so
adorned
could
wear
golden
ornaments
but
when
the
gave
me
gold
here
by
the
double
handful
a
day
i
found
that
the
price
of
these
river
hoards
decreased
and
one
day
could
you
credit
it
a
common
fellow
who
was
one
of
my
smiths
came
to
me
wearing
a
collar
of
yellow
gold
on
his
own
common
neck
well
i
had
that
neck
divided
as
payment
for
his
presumption
and
as
i
promised
to
repeat
the
division
promptly
on
all
other
offenders
that
special
species
of
forwardness
seems
to
be
checked
for
the
time
there
are
many
exasperations
deucalion
in
governing
these
common
she
had
other
things
to
say
upon
the
matter
but
at
this
point
i
saw
two
clumsy
boats
of
fishers
paddling
to
us
from
over
the
ripples
and
at
the
same
time
amongst
the
narrow
lanes
which
led
between
the
houses
on
the
other
side
of
us
men
were
beginning
to
run
after
the
litter
in
threatening
clusters
with
permission
i
said
i
will
step
out
of
the
conveyance
and
scatter
this
oh
the
people
always
cluster
round
me
poor
ugly
souls
they
seem
to
take
a
strange
delight
in
coming
to
stare
at
my
pretty
looks
but
scatter
them
i
have
said
i
did
not
wish
to
be
followed
i
am
taking
holiday
now
deucalion
am
i
not
whilst
you
learn
to
woo
me
i
stepped
to
the
ground
the
rough
fishers
in
the
boats
were
beginning
to
shout
to
those
who
dodged
amongst
the
houses
to
see
to
it
that
we
did
not
escape
and
the
numbers
who
hemmed
us
in
on
the
shore
side
were
increasing
every
moment
the
prospect
was
unpleasant
enough
we
had
come
out
beyond
the
merchants
quarters
and
were
level
with
those
small
huts
of
mud
and
grass
which
the
fishing
population
deem
sufficient
for
shelter
and
which
has
always
been
a
spot
where
turbulence
might
be
expected
indeed
even
in
those
days
of
peace
and
good
government
in
the
old
king
s
time
this
part
of
the
city
had
rarely
been
without
its
weekly
riot
the
life
of
the
fisherman
is
the
most
hard
that
any
human
toilers
have
to
endure
violence
from
the
wind
and
waves
and
pelting
from
firestones
out
of
the
sky
are
their
daily
portion
the
great
beasts
that
dwell
in
the
seas
hunt
them
with
savage
persistence
and
it
is
a
rare
day
when
at
least
some
one
of
the
fishers
guild
fails
to
come
home
to
answer
the
tally
moreover
the
manner
which
prevails
of
catching
fish
is
not
without
its
risks
to
each
man
there
is
a
large
taken
as
a
nestling
and
trained
to
the
work
a
ring
of
bronze
is
round
its
neck
to
prevent
its
swallowing
the
spoil
for
which
it
dives
and
for
each
fish
it
takes
and
flies
back
with
to
the
boat
the
head
and
tail
and
inwards
are
given
to
it
for
a
reward
the
ring
being
removed
whilst
it
makes
the
meal
the
birds
are
faithful
once
they
have
got
a
training
and
are
seldom
known
to
desert
their
owners
but
although
the
fishers
treat
them
more
kindly
than
they
do
their
wives
or
children
of
their
own
begetting
the
life
of
the
birds
is
precarious
like
that
of
their
masters
the
larger
beasts
and
fish
of
the
sea
prey
on
them
as
they
prey
on
the
smaller
fish
and
so
whatever
care
may
be
lavished
upon
them
they
are
most
liable
to
sudden
cutting
off
and
here
is
another
thing
that
makes
the
life
of
the
fisher
most
precarious
if
his
fishing
bird
be
slain
and
the
second
which
he
has
in
training
also
come
by
ill
fortune
he
is
left
suddenly
bereft
of
all
utensils
of
livelihood
and
for
aught
his
care
he
may
go
starve
for
these
fishers
hold
that
the
gods
of
the
sea
regulate
their
craft
and
that
if
one
is
not
pleasing
to
them
they
rob
him
of
his
birds
after
which
it
would
be
impious
to
have
any
truck
or
dealing
with
such
a
fellow
and
accordingly
he
is
left
to
starve
or
rob
as
he
chooses
all
of
which
circumstances
tend
to
make
the
fishers
rude
desperate
men
who
have
been
forced
into
the
trade
because
all
other
callings
have
rejected
them
they
are
fellows
moreover
who
will
spend
the
gains
of
a
month
on
a
night
s
debauch
for
fear
that
the
morrow
will
rob
them
of
life
and
the
chance
of
spending
and
moreover
it
is
their
one
point
of
honour
to
be
curbed
in
no
desire
by
an
ordinary
fear
of
consequences
as
will
appear
i
went
quickly
towards
the
largest
knot
of
these
people
who
were
skulking
behind
the
houses
leaving
the
litter
halted
in
the
path
behind
me
and
i
bade
them
sharply
enough
to
disperse
for
an
employment
i
added
put
your
houses
in
order
and
clean
the
fish
offal
from
the
lanes
between
them
i
will
come
round
here
to
inspect
and
put
this
quarter
into
a
better
order
but
for
the
empress
whose
name
be
adored
wishes
for
a
privacy
so
cease
your
then
give
us
money
said
a
shrill
voice
from
amongst
the
huts
i
will
send
you
a
torch
in
an
hour
s
time
i
said
grimly
and
rig
you
a
gallows
if
you
give
me
more
annoyance
to
your
kennels
you
i
think
they
would
have
obeyed
the
voice
of
authority
if
they
had
been
left
to
themselves
there
was
a
quick
stir
amongst
them
those
that
stood
in
the
sunlight
instinctively
slipped
into
the
shadow
and
many
dodged
into
the
houses
and
cowered
in
dark
corners
out
of
sight
but
the
men
in
the
two
that
were
paddling
up
called
them
back
with
boisterous
cries
i
signed
to
the
to
move
on
quickly
along
their
road
there
was
need
of
discipline
here
and
i
was
minded
to
deal
it
out
myself
with
a
firm
hand
i
judged
that
i
could
prevent
them
following
the
empress
but
if
she
still
remained
as
a
glittering
bait
for
them
to
rob
and
i
had
to
protect
her
also
it
might
be
that
my
work
would
not
be
done
so
effectively
but
it
seems
i
was
presumptuous
in
giving
an
order
which
dealt
with
the
person
of
phorenice
she
bade
the
bearers
stand
where
they
were
and
stepped
out
and
drew
her
weapons
from
beneath
the
cushions
she
came
towards
me
strapping
a
sword
on
to
her
hip
and
carrying
a
target
of
gold
on
her
left
forearm
an
unfair
trick
cries
she
laughing
if
you
will
keep
a
fight
to
yourself
now
deucalion
where
will
your
greediness
carry
you
when
i
am
your
shrinking
wistful
little
wife
are
these
fools
truly
going
to
stand
up
against
us
i
was
not
coveting
a
fight
but
it
seemed
as
if
there
would
be
no
avoidance
of
it
now
the
robe
and
the
glittering
gauds
of
which
phorenice
had
recently
despoiled
the
merchant
drew
the
eyes
of
these
people
with
keen
attraction
the
fishers
in
the
boats
paddled
into
the
surf
which
edged
the
beach
and
leaped
overside
and
left
the
frail
structures
to
be
spewed
up
sound
or
smashed
as
chance
ordered
and
from
the
houses
and
from
the
filthy
lanes
between
them
poured
out
hordes
of
others
women
mixed
with
the
men
gathering
round
us
threateningly
have
a
care
shouted
one
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
she
called
down
fire
for
the
sacrifice
once
and
she
can
burn
up
others
here
if
she
so
much
the
more
for
those
that
are
left
retorted
another
she
can
not
burn
nay
i
will
not
burn
any
said
phorenice
but
you
shall
look
upon
my
till
you
are
i
heard
her
say
that
with
some
malicious
amusement
knowing
as
one
of
the
seven
how
she
had
called
down
the
fires
of
the
sky
to
burn
that
horse
offered
in
sacrifice
and
knowing
too
full
well
that
she
could
bring
down
no
fire
here
but
they
gave
us
little
enough
time
for
wordy
courtesies
their
empress
never
went
far
unattended
and
for
aught
the
wretches
knew
an
escort
might
be
close
behind
so
what
pilfering
they
did
it
behoved
them
to
get
done
quickly
they
closed
in
jostling
one
another
to
be
first
and
the
reek
of
their
filthy
bodies
made
us
cough
a
grimy
hand
launched
out
to
seize
some
of
the
jewels
which
flashed
on
phorenice
s
breast
and
i
lopped
it
off
at
the
elbow
so
that
it
fell
at
her
feet
and
a
second
later
we
were
engaged
your
back
to
mine
comrade
cried
she
with
a
laugh
and
then
drew
and
laid
about
her
with
fine
dexterity
bah
but
it
was
mere
slaughter
that
first
bout
the
crowd
hustled
inwards
with
such
greediness
to
seize
what
they
could
that
none
had
space
to
draw
back
elbow
for
a
thrust
and
we
two
kept
a
circle
round
us
by
sheer
whirling
of
steel
it
is
necessary
to
do
one
s
work
cleanly
in
these
bouts
as
wounded
left
on
the
ground
unnoticed
before
one
are
as
dangerous
as
so
many
snakes
but
as
we
circled
round
in
our
battling
i
noted
that
all
of
phorenice
s
quarry
lay
peaceful
and
still
by
the
gods
but
she
could
play
a
fine
sword
this
dainty
empress
she
touched
life
with
every
thrust
yes
it
was
plain
to
see
now
an
example
was
given
that
the
throne
of
atlantis
had
been
won
not
by
a
lovely
face
and
a
subtle
tongue
alone
and
as
a
fighter
myself
i
did
not
like
phorenice
the
less
for
the
knowledge
i
could
but
see
her
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
and
that
only
now
and
again
for
the
fishers
despite
their
of
fence
and
the
clumsiness
of
their
weapons
had
heavy
numbers
and
most
savage
ferocity
and
as
they
made
so
confident
of
being
able
to
pull
us
down
it
required
more
than
a
little
hard
battling
to
keep
them
from
doing
it
ay
by
the
gods
it
was
at
times
a
fight
my
heart
warmed
to
and
if
i
had
not
contrived
to
pluck
a
shield
from
one
fool
who
came
too
near
me
with
one
i
could
not
swear
they
would
not
have
dragged
me
down
by
sheer
ravening
savageness
and
always
above
the
burly
uproar
of
the
fight
came
very
pleasantly
to
my
ears
phorenice
s
cry
of
deucalion
which
she
chose
as
her
battle
shout
i
knew
her
of
course
to
be
a
of
the
art
of
compliment
and
it
was
no
new
thing
for
me
to
hear
the
name
roared
out
above
a
battle
din
but
it
was
given
there
under
circumstances
which
were
peculiar
and
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
being
tickled
by
the
flattery
condemn
my
weakness
how
you
will
but
i
came
very
near
then
to
liking
the
empress
of
atlantis
in
the
way
she
wished
and
as
for
that
other
woman
who
should
have
filled
my
mind
i
will
confess
that
the
stress
of
the
moment
and
the
fury
of
the
engagement
had
driven
both
her
and
her
strait
completely
out
beyond
the
marches
of
my
memory
of
such
frail
stuff
are
we
made
even
those
of
us
who
esteem
ourselves
the
strongest
now
it
is
a
temptation
few
men
born
to
the
sword
can
resist
to
throw
themselves
heart
and
soul
into
a
fight
for
a
fight
s
sake
and
it
seems
that
women
can
be
bitten
with
the
same
fierce
infection
the
attack
slackened
and
halted
we
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
ring
of
twisted
dead
and
the
rest
of
the
fishers
and
their
women
who
hemmed
us
in
shrank
back
out
of
reach
of
our
weapons
it
was
the
moment
for
a
truce
and
the
moment
when
a
few
strong
words
would
have
sent
them
back
cowering
to
their
huts
and
given
us
free
passage
to
go
where
we
chose
but
no
this
phorenice
must
needs
sing
a
hymn
to
her
sword
and
mine
gloating
over
our
feats
and
invulnerability
and
then
she
must
needs
ask
payment
for
the
bearers
of
her
litter
whom
they
had
killed
and
then
speak
balefully
of
the
burnings
and
the
skinnings
and
the
sawings
asunder
with
which
this
fishers
quarter
would
be
treated
in
the
near
future
till
they
learned
the
virtues
of
deportment
and
genteel
manners
it
makes
your
backs
creep
does
it
said
phorenice
i
do
not
wonder
this
severity
must
have
its
unpleasant
side
but
why
do
you
not
put
it
beyond
my
power
to
give
the
order
either
you
must
think
yourselves
gods
or
me
no
goddess
or
you
would
not
have
gone
on
so
far
come
now
you
people
follow
out
your
theory
and
if
you
make
a
good
fight
of
it
i
swear
by
my
face
i
will
be
lenient
with
those
who
do
not
but
there
was
no
pressing
up
to
meet
our
swords
they
still
ringed
us
in
savage
and
sullen
beyond
the
ring
of
their
own
dead
and
would
neither
run
back
to
the
houses
nor
give
us
the
game
of
further
fight
there
was
a
certain
stubborn
bravery
about
them
that
one
could
not
but
admire
and
for
myself
i
determined
that
next
time
it
became
my
duty
to
raise
troops
i
would
catch
a
handful
of
these
men
and
teach
them
handiness
with
the
utensils
of
war
and
train
them
to
loyalty
and
faithfulness
but
presently
from
behind
their
ranks
a
stone
flew
and
though
it
whizzed
between
the
empress
and
myself
and
struck
down
a
fisher
it
showed
that
they
had
brought
a
new
method
into
their
attack
and
it
behoved
us
to
take
thought
and
meet
it
i
looked
round
me
up
and
down
the
beach
there
was
no
sign
of
a
rescue
phorenice
i
said
in
the
court
tongue
which
these
barbarous
fishers
would
know
little
enough
of
i
take
it
that
a
whiff
of
the
would
come
very
pleasant
after
all
this
warm
play
as
you
can
show
such
pretty
sword
work
will
you
cut
me
a
way
down
to
the
beach
and
i
will
do
my
poor
best
to
keep
these
creatures
from
snapping
at
our
heels
oh
cried
she
then
i
am
to
have
a
courtier
for
a
husband
after
all
why
have
you
kept
back
your
flattering
speeches
till
now
is
that
your
trick
to
make
me
love
you
i
will
think
out
the
reason
for
it
another
ah
these
stern
commanding
husbands
said
she
how
they
do
press
upon
their
little
wives
and
with
that
leaped
over
the
ring
of
dead
before
her
and
cut
and
stabbed
a
way
through
those
that
stood
between
her
and
the
waters
which
creamed
and
crashed
upon
the
beach
gods
what
a
charge
she
made
it
made
me
tingle
with
admiration
as
i
followed
sideways
behind
her
guarding
the
rear
and
i
am
a
man
that
has
spent
so
many
years
in
battling
that
it
takes
something
far
out
of
the
common
to
move
me
to
any
enthusiasm
in
this
matter
there
were
two
boats
creaking
and
washing
about
in
the
edge
of
the
surf
but
in
one
happily
the
which
made
its
frame
was
crushed
by
the
weight
of
the
waves
into
a
shapeless
bundle
of
sticks
and
would
take
half
a
day
to
replace
so
that
let
us
but
get
the
other
craft
afloat
and
we
should
be
free
from
further
embroiling
but
the
fishers
were
quick
to
see
the
object
of
this
new
manoeuvre
guard
the
boat
they
shouted
smash
her
slit
her
skin
with
your
knives
tear
her
with
your
fingers
swim
her
out
to
sea
oh
at
least
take
the
paddles
but
if
these
clumsy
fishers
could
run
phorenice
was
like
a
legged
snake
for
speed
she
was
down
beside
the
boat
before
any
could
reach
it
laughing
and
shouting
out
that
she
could
beat
them
at
every
point
myself
i
was
slower
of
foot
and
besides
there
was
some
that
offered
me
a
fight
on
the
road
and
i
was
not
wishful
to
baulk
them
and
moreover
the
fewer
we
left
clamouring
behind
the
fewer
there
would
be
to
speed
our
going
with
their
stones
still
i
came
to
the
beach
in
good
order
and
laid
hands
on
the
flimsy
boat
and
tipped
her
dry
fighting
is
no
trade
for
me
i
cried
whilst
you
are
here
phorenice
guard
me
my
back
and
walk
out
into
the
i
took
the
boat
thrusting
it
afloat
and
wading
with
it
till
two
lines
of
the
surf
were
past
the
fishers
swarmed
round
us
active
as
fish
in
their
native
element
and
strove
mightily
to
get
hands
on
the
boat
and
slit
the
hides
which
covered
it
with
their
eager
fingers
but
i
had
a
spare
hand
and
a
short
for
such
work
and
here
there
and
everywhere
was
phorenice
the
empress
with
her
thirsty
dripping
sword
by
the
gods
i
laughed
with
sheer
delight
at
seeing
her
art
of
fence
but
the
swirl
of
a
great
fish
into
the
shallows
and
the
squeal
of
a
fisher
as
he
was
dragged
down
and
home
away
into
the
deep
made
me
mindful
of
foes
that
no
skill
can
conquer
and
no
bravery
avoid
without
taking
time
to
give
the
empress
a
word
of
warning
i
stooped
and
flung
an
arm
round
her
and
threw
her
up
out
of
the
water
into
the
boat
and
then
thrust
on
with
all
my
might
driving
the
flimsy
craft
out
to
sea
whilst
my
legs
crept
under
me
for
fear
of
the
beasts
which
swam
invisible
beneath
the
muddied
waters
to
the
fishers
inured
to
these
horrid
perils
by
daily
association
the
seizing
of
one
of
their
number
meant
little
and
they
pressed
on
careless
of
their
dull
lives
eager
only
to
snatch
the
jewels
which
still
flaunted
on
phorenice
s
breast
of
the
vengeance
that
might
come
after
they
recked
nothing
let
them
but
get
the
wherewithal
for
one
night
s
good
debauch
and
they
would
forget
that
such
a
thing
as
the
morning
of
a
morrow
could
have
existence
two
fellows
i
caught
and
killed
that
diving
down
beneath
tried
to
slit
the
skin
of
the
boat
out
of
sight
under
the
water
and
phorenice
cared
for
all
those
that
tried
to
put
a
hand
on
the
gunwales
yes
and
she
did
more
than
that
a
huge
turtle
that
was
stirred
out
of
the
mud
by
the
turmoil
came
up
to
daylight
and
swung
its
great
mouth
to
this
side
and
that
seeking
for
a
prey
the
fishers
near
it
dodged
and
dived
i
thrusting
at
the
stern
of
the
boat
could
only
hope
it
would
pass
me
by
and
so
offered
an
easy
mark
it
scurried
towards
me
champing
its
noisy
lips
and
beating
the
water
into
spray
with
its
flippers
but
phorenice
was
quick
with
a
remedy
and
a
rescue
she
passed
her
sword
through
one
of
the
fishers
that
pressed
her
and
then
thrust
the
body
towards
the
turtle
the
great
neck
swooped
towards
it
the
long
slimy
feelers
which
protruded
from
its
head
quivered
and
snuffled
and
then
the
horny
green
jaws
crunched
on
it
and
drew
it
down
out
of
sight
the
boat
was
in
deep
water
now
and
phorenice
called
upon
me
to
come
in
over
the
side
she
the
while
balancing
nicely
so
that
the
flimsy
thing
should
not
be
overset
the
fishers
had
given
up
their
pursuit
finding
that
they
earned
nothing
but
arms
and
split
faces
by
coming
within
swing
of
this
terrible
sword
of
their
empress
and
so
contented
themselves
with
volleying
jagged
stones
in
the
hopes
of
stunning
us
or
splitting
the
boat
however
phorenice
crouched
in
the
stern
holding
the
two
shields
her
own
golden
target
and
the
rough
hide
buckler
i
had
won
and
so
protected
both
of
us
whilst
i
paddled
and
though
many
stones
clattered
against
the
shields
and
hit
the
hide
covering
of
the
boat
so
that
it
resounded
like
a
drum
none
of
them
did
damage
and
we
drew
quickly
out
of
their
range
the
drug
of
our
lady
the
moon
our
lord
the
sun
was
riding
towards
the
end
of
his
day
and
the
smoke
from
a
burning
mountain
fanned
black
and
forbidding
before
his
face
phorenice
wrung
the
water
from
her
clothes
and
shivered
work
hard
with
those
paddles
deucalion
and
take
me
in
through
the
and
let
me
be
restored
to
my
comforts
again
that
merchant
would
rue
if
he
saw
how
his
pretty
garments
were
spoiled
and
i
rue
too
being
a
woman
and
remembering
that
he
at
least
has
no
others
i
can
take
in
place
of
she
looked
at
me
sidelong
tossing
back
the
short
red
hair
from
her
eyes
what
think
you
of
my
wisdom
in
coming
where
we
have
come
without
an
escort
the
empress
can
do
no
wrong
i
quoted
the
old
formula
with
a
smile
at
least
i
have
shown
you
that
i
can
fight
i
caught
you
looking
your
approval
of
me
quite
pleasantly
once
or
twice
you
were
a
difficult
man
to
thaw
deucalion
but
you
warm
perceptibly
as
you
keep
on
being
near
me
la
sir
we
shall
be
a
pair
of
rustic
sweethearts
yet
if
this
goes
on
i
am
glad
i
thought
of
the
device
of
going
near
those
smelly
so
she
had
taken
me
out
in
the
litter
unattended
for
the
plain
purpose
of
inviting
a
fight
and
showing
me
her
skill
at
arms
and
perhaps
too
of
seeing
in
person
how
i
also
carried
myself
in
a
moment
of
stress
well
if
we
were
to
live
on
together
as
husband
and
wife
it
was
good
that
each
should
know
to
a
nicety
the
other
s
powers
and
also
i
am
too
much
of
an
old
battler
and
too
much
enamoured
with
the
glorious
handling
of
arms
to
quarrel
very
deeply
with
any
one
who
offers
me
a
tough
upstanding
fight
still
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
help
comparing
phorenice
with
another
woman
with
a
similar
chance
open
before
us
nais
had
robbed
me
of
the
struggle
through
a
sheer
pity
for
those
squalid
rebels
who
did
not
even
call
her
chieftain
whilst
here
was
this
empress
frittering
away
two
score
of
the
hardiest
of
her
subjects
merely
to
gratify
a
whim
yet
loyal
to
my
vow
as
a
priest
and
to
the
commands
set
upon
me
by
the
high
council
on
the
sacred
mountain
i
tried
to
put
away
these
wayward
thoughts
and
comparisons
as
i
rowed
over
the
swingings
of
the
waves
towards
the
forts
which
guard
the
harbour
s
mouth
i
sent
prayers
to
the
high
gods
to
give
my
tongue
dexterity
and
they
through
their
love
for
the
country
of
atlantis
and
the
harassed
people
whom
it
was
my
deep
wish
to
serve
granted
me
that
power
of
speech
which
phorenice
loved
her
eyes
glowed
upon
me
as
i
talked
this
beach
of
the
fishers
where
we
had
had
our
passage
at
arms
is
safe
from
ship
attack
from
without
by
reason
of
a
chain
of
jagged
rocks
which
spring
up
from
the
deep
and
run
from
the
harbour
side
to
the
end
of
the
city
wall
the
fishers
know
the
passes
and
can
oftentimes
get
through
to
the
open
water
beyond
without
touching
a
stone
or
if
they
do
see
a
danger
of
hitting
on
the
reef
leap
out
and
carry
their
light
boats
in
their
hands
till
the
water
floats
them
again
but
here
i
had
neither
the
knowledge
nor
the
dexterity
and
thought
i
now
the
high
gods
will
show
finally
if
they
wish
this
woman
who
has
defiled
them
to
reign
on
in
atlantis
and
if
also
they
wish
me
to
serve
as
her
husband
i
cried
these
things
in
my
heart
and
waited
to
receive
the
omen
there
was
no
a
great
wave
rose
in
the
lagoon
behind
us
a
wave
such
as
could
have
only
been
caused
by
an
earth
tremor
and
on
its
sleek
back
we
were
hurled
forward
and
thrown
clear
of
the
reefs
with
their
seaweeds
licking
round
us
without
so
much
as
seeing
a
stone
of
the
barrier
i
bowed
my
head
as
i
rowed
on
towards
the
harbour
forts
it
was
plain
that
not
yet
would
the
high
gods
take
vengeance
for
the
insults
which
this
lovely
woman
had
offered
them
the
sentries
in
the
two
forts
beat
drums
at
one
another
in
their
accustomed
rotation
and
in
the
growing
dusk
were
going
to
pay
little
enough
attention
to
the
fishingboat
which
lay
against
the
great
chain
clamouring
to
have
it
lowered
but
luckily
a
pair
of
officers
were
taking
the
air
of
the
evening
in
a
turret
of
the
roof
of
the
nearer
fort
and
these
recognised
the
tone
of
our
shouts
they
silenced
the
drums
torches
were
lowered
to
make
sure
of
our
faces
and
then
with
a
splash
the
great
chain
was
dropped
into
the
water
to
give
us
passage
a
galley
lay
inside
nuzzling
the
harbour
wall
and
presently
the
ladder
of
ropes
was
let
down
from
the
top
of
the
nearest
fort
and
a
crew
came
down
to
man
the
oars
there
were
the
customary
changes
of
raiment
too
given
as
presents
by
the
officers
of
the
fort
and
these
we
put
on
in
the
cabin
of
the
galley
in
place
of
the
sodden
clothes
we
wore
there
are
fevers
to
be
gained
by
carrying
wet
clothes
after
sunset
and
though
from
personal
experience
i
have
learned
that
these
may
be
warded
off
with
drugs
i
noticed
with
some
grim
amusement
that
the
empress
had
sufficiently
little
of
the
goddess
about
her
to
fear
very
much
the
ailments
which
are
due
to
frail
humanity
the
galley
rowed
swiftly
across
the
calm
waters
of
the
harbour
and
made
fast
to
the
rings
of
gold
on
the
royal
quay
and
whilst
we
were
waiting
for
litters
to
be
brought
i
watched
a
lantern
lit
in
the
boat
which
stood
guard
over
phorenice
s
mammoth
the
huge
red
beast
stood
in
the
harbour
water
with
trunk
it
was
tamed
now
and
the
light
of
the
boat
s
lantern
fell
on
the
little
ripples
sent
out
by
its
tremblings
but
i
did
not
choose
to
intercede
or
ask
mercy
for
it
if
the
mammoth
sank
deeper
in
the
harbour
mud
and
was
swallowed
i
could
have
borne
the
loss
with
equanimity
to
tell
the
truth
that
ride
on
the
great
beast
s
back
had
impressed
me
unfavourably
in
fact
it
put
into
me
a
sense
of
helplessness
that
was
wellnigh
intolerable
perhaps
circumstances
have
made
me
unduly
on
that
others
must
judge
but
i
will
own
to
having
a
preference
for
walking
on
my
own
proper
feet
as
the
gods
in
fashioning
our
shapes
most
certainly
intended
on
my
own
feet
i
am
able
to
guard
my
own
head
and
neck
and
have
done
on
four
continents
throughout
a
long
and
active
life
and
on
many
a
thousand
occasions
but
on
the
back
of
that
detestable
mammoth
pah
i
grew
as
nervous
as
a
child
or
a
dastard
however
i
had
little
enough
leisure
for
personal
megrims
just
then
whilst
we
waited
phorenice
asked
the
who
must
needs
come
up
officiously
to
make
his
salutations
after
the
disposal
of
nais
and
was
told
that
she
had
been
clapped
into
a
dungeon
beneath
the
royal
pyramid
and
the
officer
of
the
guard
there
had
given
his
bond
for
her
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
understands
his
work
said
the
empress
that
pretty
nais
knows
the
pyramid
better
than
most
and
it
may
be
he
will
be
sent
to
the
tormentors
for
putting
her
in
a
cell
which
had
a
secret
outlet
you
would
feel
pleasure
if
the
girl
escaped
deucalion
assuredly
said
i
knowing
how
useless
it
would
be
to
make
a
secret
of
the
matter
i
have
no
enmity
against
but
i
have
said
she
viciously
and
i
am
still
minded
to
lock
your
faith
to
me
by
that
wedding
gift
you
know
the
thing
shall
be
done
i
said
before
all
the
empress
of
poof
deucalion
you
are
too
stiff
and
formal
you
ought
to
be
mightily
honoured
that
i
condescend
to
be
jealous
of
your
favours
your
hand
sir
please
to
help
me
into
the
litter
and
now
come
in
beside
me
and
keep
me
warm
against
the
night
air
ho
you
guards
there
with
the
torches
keep
farther
back
against
the
street
walls
the
perfume
you
are
burning
stifles
again
there
was
a
feast
that
night
in
the
royal
again
i
sat
beside
phorenice
on
the
raised
dais
which
stands
beneath
the
symbols
of
the
snake
and
the
hand
what
had
been
taken
for
granted
before
about
our
forthcoming
relationship
was
this
time
proclaimed
openly
the
empress
herself
acknowledged
me
as
her
husband
that
was
to
be
and
all
that
curled
and
jewelled
throng
of
courtiers
hailed
me
as
greater
than
themselves
by
reason
of
this
woman
s
choice
there
was
method
too
in
their
salutation
some
rumour
must
have
got
about
of
my
preference
for
the
older
and
simpler
habits
and
there
was
no
drinking
wine
to
my
health
after
the
new
and
as
i
considered
impertinent
manner
decorously
each
lord
and
lady
there
came
forward
and
each
in
turn
spilt
a
goblet
at
my
feet
and
when
i
called
any
up
whether
man
or
woman
to
receive
from
my
platter
it
was
eaten
simply
and
thankfully
and
not
kissed
or
pocketed
with
any
extravagant
gesture
the
flaring
jets
of
showed
me
too
so
i
thought
a
plainer
habit
of
dress
and
a
more
sober
mien
amongst
this
thoughtless
mob
of
banqueters
and
indeed
it
must
have
been
plain
to
notice
for
phorenice
leaning
over
till
the
ruddy
curls
on
her
shoulder
brushed
my
face
chided
me
in
a
playful
whisper
as
having
usurped
her
high
authority
already
oh
sir
she
pleaded
mockingly
do
not
make
your
rule
over
us
too
ascetic
i
have
given
no
orders
for
this
change
but
there
are
no
perfumes
in
the
air
the
food
is
so
plain
and
i
have
half
a
mind
to
burn
the
cook
and
as
for
the
clothes
and
gauds
of
these
diners
by
my
face
they
might
have
come
straight
from
the
old
king
s
reign
before
i
stepped
in
here
to
show
how
tasteful
could
be
colours
on
a
robe
or
how
pretty
the
glint
of
a
jewel
it
s
done
by
no
orders
of
mine
deucalion
they
have
swung
round
to
this
change
by
sheer
courtier
instinct
why
look
at
the
beards
of
the
men
there
is
not
half
the
curl
about
many
of
them
that
they
showed
with
such
exquisiteness
yesterday
by
my
face
i
believe
they
d
reap
their
chins
as
smooth
as
yours
if
you
go
on
setting
the
fashions
at
this
prodigious
rate
and
i
do
not
why
hinder
them
if
they
feel
more
cleanly
shaven
no
sir
there
shall
be
only
one
clean
chin
where
a
beard
can
grow
in
all
atlantis
and
that
shall
be
carried
by
the
man
who
is
husband
to
the
empress
why
my
deucalion
would
you
have
no
sumptuary
laws
would
you
have
these
good
folk
here
and
the
common
people
outside
imitate
us
in
every
cut
of
the
hair
and
every
fold
of
a
garment
which
it
pleases
us
to
discover
come
sir
if
you
and
i
chose
to
say
that
our
sovereignty
was
marked
only
by
our
superior
strength
of
arm
and
wit
they
would
hate
us
at
once
for
our
arrogance
whereas
if
we
keep
apart
to
ourselves
a
few
mere
personal
decorations
these
become
just
objects
to
admire
and
pleasantly
you
show
me
that
there
is
more
in
the
office
of
a
ruler
than
meets
the
and
yet
they
tell
me
and
indeed
show
me
that
you
have
ruled
with
some
i
employed
the
older
method
it
requires
a
phorenice
to
invent
these
nicer
flatterer
said
she
and
smote
me
playfully
with
the
back
of
her
little
fingers
on
my
arm
you
are
becoming
as
great
a
courtier
as
any
of
them
you
make
me
blush
with
your
fine
pleasantries
deucalion
and
there
is
no
here
to
cool
my
cheek
i
must
choose
me
another
but
it
shall
not
be
ylga
ylga
seems
to
have
more
of
a
kindness
for
you
than
i
like
and
if
she
is
wise
she
will
go
live
in
her
palace
at
the
other
side
of
the
city
and
there
occupy
herself
with
the
ordering
of
her
slaves
and
the
makings
of
embroideries
i
shall
not
be
hard
on
ylga
unless
she
forces
me
but
i
will
have
no
woman
in
this
kingdom
treat
you
with
undue
and
how
am
i
to
act
said
i
falling
in
with
her
mood
when
i
see
and
hear
all
the
men
of
atlantis
making
their
protestations
before
you
by
your
own
confession
they
all
love
you
as
ardently
as
they
seem
to
have
loved
you
ah
now
she
said
you
must
not
ask
me
to
do
impossibilities
i
am
powerful
if
you
will
but
i
have
no
force
which
will
govern
the
hearts
of
these
poor
fellows
on
matters
such
as
that
but
if
you
choose
you
make
proclamation
that
i
am
given
now
body
and
inwards
to
you
and
if
they
continue
to
offend
your
pride
in
this
matter
you
may
take
your
culprits
and
give
them
over
to
the
tormentors
indeed
deucalion
i
think
it
would
be
a
pretty
attention
to
me
if
you
did
arrange
some
such
ceremony
it
seems
to
me
a
present
she
added
with
a
frown
that
the
jealousy
is
too
much
on
one
you
must
not
expect
that
a
man
who
has
been
divorced
from
love
for
all
of
a
busy
life
can
learn
all
its
niceties
in
an
instant
myself
i
was
feeling
proud
of
my
progress
with
any
other
schoolmistress
than
you
phorenice
i
should
not
be
near
so
forward
in
fact
if
one
may
judge
by
my
past
record
i
should
not
have
begun
to
learn
at
i
suppose
you
think
i
should
be
satisfied
with
that
well
i
am
not
i
can
be
finely
greedy
over
some
the
banquet
this
night
did
not
extend
to
inordinate
length
phorenice
had
gone
through
much
since
last
she
slept
and
though
she
had
declared
herself
goddess
in
the
meantime
it
seemed
that
her
body
remained
mortal
as
heretofore
the
black
rings
of
weariness
had
grown
under
her
wondrous
eyes
and
she
lay
back
amongst
the
cushions
of
the
divan
with
her
limbs
slackened
and
listless
when
the
dancers
came
and
postured
before
us
she
threw
them
a
jewel
and
bade
them
begone
before
they
had
given
a
half
of
their
performance
and
the
poet
a
silly
swelling
fellow
who
came
to
sing
the
deeds
of
the
day
she
would
not
hear
at
all
she
said
wearily
but
for
now
grant
me
peace
my
lord
deucalion
has
given
me
much
food
for
thought
this
day
and
presently
i
go
to
my
chamber
to
muse
over
the
future
policies
of
this
state
throughout
the
night
come
to
me
again
and
if
your
poetry
is
good
and
short
i
will
pay
you
surprisingly
but
see
to
it
that
you
are
not
if
there
are
superfluous
words
i
will
pay
you
for
those
with
the
she
rose
to
her
feet
then
and
when
the
banqueters
had
made
their
salutation
to
us
i
led
her
away
from
the
and
down
the
passages
with
their
secret
doors
which
led
to
her
private
chambers
she
clung
on
my
arm
and
once
when
we
halted
whilst
a
great
stone
block
swung
slowly
ajar
to
let
us
pass
she
drooped
her
head
against
my
shoulder
her
breath
came
warm
against
my
cheek
and
the
loveliness
of
her
face
so
close
at
hand
surpasses
the
description
of
words
i
think
it
was
in
her
mind
that
i
should
kiss
the
red
lips
which
were
held
so
near
to
mine
but
willing
though
i
was
to
play
the
part
appointed
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
that
so
when
the
stone
block
had
swung
she
drew
away
with
a
sigh
and
we
went
on
without
further
speech
may
the
high
gods
treat
you
tenderly
i
said
when
we
came
to
the
door
of
her
i
am
my
own
god
said
she
in
all
things
but
one
by
my
face
you
are
a
tardy
wooer
deucalion
where
do
you
go
now
to
my
own
oh
go
then
is
there
anything
more
i
could
do
nothing
that
your
wit
or
your
will
would
prompt
you
to
yes
indeed
you
are
finely
decorous
deucalion
in
your
way
but
you
are
a
mighty
poor
wooer
don
t
you
know
my
man
that
a
woman
esteems
some
things
the
more
highly
if
they
are
taken
from
her
by
rude
force
it
seems
i
know
little
enough
about
you
never
said
a
truer
word
bah
and
i
believe
your
coldness
brings
you
more
benefit
in
a
certain
matter
than
any
show
of
passion
could
earn
there
get
you
gone
if
the
atmosphere
of
a
maiden
s
hurts
your
rustic
modesty
and
your
gods
keep
you
deucalion
if
that
s
the
phrase
and
if
you
think
they
can
do
it
get
you
gone
man
and
leave
me
i
had
taken
the
plan
of
the
pyramid
out
of
the
archives
before
the
banquet
and
learned
it
thoroughly
and
so
was
able
to
thread
my
way
through
its
angular
mazes
without
pause
or
blunder
i
too
was
heavily
wearied
with
what
i
had
gone
through
since
my
last
snatch
of
sleep
but
i
dare
set
apart
no
time
for
rest
just
then
nais
must
be
sacrificed
in
part
for
the
needs
of
atlantis
but
a
plan
had
come
to
me
by
which
it
seemed
that
she
need
not
be
sacrificed
wholly
and
to
carry
this
through
there
was
need
for
quick
thought
and
action
help
came
to
me
also
from
a
quarter
i
did
not
expect
as
i
passed
along
the
tortuous
way
between
the
ponderous
stones
of
the
pyramid
which
led
to
the
apartments
that
had
been
given
me
by
phorenice
a
woman
glided
up
out
of
the
shadows
of
one
of
the
side
passages
and
when
i
lifted
my
hand
lamp
there
was
ylga
she
regarded
me
i
have
lost
my
place
she
said
and
it
seems
i
need
never
have
spoken
she
intended
to
have
you
all
along
and
it
was
not
a
thing
like
that
which
could
put
her
off
and
you
you
just
think
me
officious
if
indeed
you
have
ever
given
me
another
thought
till
i
never
forget
a
oh
you
will
learn
that
trick
soon
now
and
you
are
going
to
marry
her
you
the
city
is
ringing
with
it
i
thought
at
least
you
were
honest
but
when
there
is
a
high
place
to
be
got
by
merely
taking
a
woman
with
it
you
are
like
the
rest
i
thought
too
that
you
would
be
one
of
those
men
who
have
a
distrust
for
ruddy
hair
and
besides
she
is
ylga
i
said
you
have
taught
me
that
these
walls
are
full
of
crannies
and
ears
i
will
listen
to
no
word
against
phorenice
but
i
would
have
further
converse
with
you
soon
if
you
still
have
a
kindness
for
me
go
to
the
chamber
that
is
mine
and
wait
for
me
there
i
will
join
you
she
drooped
her
eyes
what
do
you
want
of
me
deucalion
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
you
will
learn
who
it
concerns
but
is
it
is
it
fitting
for
a
maiden
to
come
to
a
man
s
room
at
this
hour
i
know
little
of
your
conventions
here
in
this
new
atlantis
i
am
deucalion
girl
and
if
you
still
have
qualms
remembering
that
do
not
she
looked
up
at
me
with
a
sneer
i
was
foolish
she
said
my
lord
s
coldness
has
grown
into
a
proverb
and
i
should
have
remembered
it
yes
i
will
go
now
then
said
i
and
waited
till
she
had
passed
on
ahead
and
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
with
ylga
to
help
me
my
tasks
were
somewhat
lightened
and
their
sequence
changed
in
the
first
instance
now
i
had
got
to
make
my
way
with
as
little
delay
and
show
as
possible
into
a
certain
sanctuary
which
lay
within
the
temple
of
our
lady
the
moon
and
here
my
knowledge
as
one
of
the
seven
stood
me
in
high
favour
all
the
temples
of
the
city
of
atlantis
are
in
immediate
and
secret
connection
with
the
royal
pyramid
but
the
passages
are
little
used
seeing
that
they
are
known
only
to
the
seven
and
to
the
three
above
them
supposing
that
there
are
three
men
living
at
one
time
sufficiently
learned
in
the
highest
of
the
highest
mysteries
to
be
installed
in
that
sublime
degree
of
the
three
and
even
by
these
the
secret
ways
may
only
be
used
on
occasions
of
the
greatest
stress
so
that
a
generation
well
may
pass
without
their
being
trodden
by
a
human
foot
it
was
with
some
trouble
and
after
no
little
experiment
that
i
groped
my
way
into
this
secret
alley
but
once
there
the
rest
was
easy
i
had
never
trodden
it
before
certainly
but
the
plan
of
it
had
been
taught
me
at
my
initiation
as
one
of
the
seven
and
the
course
of
the
windings
came
back
to
me
now
with
easy
accuracy
i
walked
quickly
not
only
because
the
air
in
those
deep
crannies
is
always
full
of
lurking
evils
but
also
because
the
hours
were
fleeting
and
much
must
be
done
before
our
lord
the
sun
again
rose
to
make
another
day
i
came
to
the
which
commands
the
temple
and
found
the
holy
place
empty
and
alas
and
showing
little
trace
that
worshippers
ever
frequented
it
these
latter
years
a
vast
stone
of
the
wall
swung
outwards
and
gave
me
entrance
and
presently
after
the
solemn
prayer
which
is
needful
before
attempting
these
matters
i
took
the
metal
stair
from
the
place
where
it
is
kept
and
climbed
to
the
lap
of
the
goddess
and
then
pulling
the
stair
after
me
climbed
again
upwards
till
my
length
lay
against
her
calm
mysterious
face
a
shivering
seized
me
as
i
thought
of
what
was
intended
for
even
a
warrior
hardened
to
horrid
sights
and
deeds
may
well
have
qualms
when
he
is
called
upon
to
juggle
with
life
and
death
and
years
and
history
with
the
welfare
of
his
country
in
one
hand
and
the
future
of
a
woman
who
is
as
life
to
him
in
the
other
but
again
i
told
myself
that
the
hours
flew
and
laid
hold
of
the
jewel
which
is
studded
into
the
forehead
of
the
image
with
one
hand
and
then
stretching
out
thrust
at
a
corner
of
the
eyebrow
with
the
other
with
a
faint
creak
the
massive
eyeball
below
a
stone
that
i
could
barely
have
covered
with
my
back
swung
inwards
i
stepped
off
the
stair
and
climbed
into
the
gap
inside
was
the
chamber
which
is
hollowed
from
the
head
of
the
goddess
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
seen
this
most
secret
place
but
the
aspect
of
it
was
familiar
to
me
from
my
teaching
and
i
knew
where
to
find
the
thing
which
would
fill
my
need
yet
occupied
though
i
might
be
with
the
stress
of
what
was
to
befall
i
could
not
help
having
a
wonder
and
an
admiration
for
the
cleverness
with
which
it
was
hidden
high
as
i
was
in
the
learning
and
mysteries
of
the
priestly
clan
the
structure
of
what
i
had
come
to
fetch
was
hidden
from
me
beforetime
i
had
known
only
of
their
power
and
effect
and
now
that
i
came
to
handle
them
i
saw
only
some
roughly
rounded
balls
like
nut
kernels
grass
green
in
colour
and
in
hardness
like
the
wax
of
bees
there
were
three
of
these
balls
in
the
hidden
place
and
i
took
the
one
that
was
needful
concealing
the
others
as
i
had
found
them
it
may
have
been
a
drug
it
may
have
been
something
more
what
exactly
it
was
i
did
not
know
only
of
its
power
and
effect
i
was
sure
as
that
was
set
forth
plainly
in
the
teaching
i
had
learned
and
so
i
put
it
in
a
pouch
of
my
garment
returning
by
the
way
i
had
come
and
replacing
all
things
in
due
order
behind
me
one
look
i
took
at
the
image
of
the
goddess
before
i
left
the
temple
the
jet
of
which
burns
eternally
from
the
central
altar
lit
her
from
head
to
toe
and
threw
sparkles
from
the
great
jewel
in
her
forehead
vast
she
was
and
calm
and
peaceful
beyond
all
human
imaginings
a
perfect
symbolism
of
that
rest
and
quietness
which
many
sigh
for
so
vainly
on
this
rude
earth
but
which
they
will
never
attain
unless
by
their
piety
they
earn
a
place
in
the
hereafter
where
our
lady
the
moon
and
the
rest
of
the
high
ones
reign
in
their
eternal
glorious
majesty
it
was
with
tired
dragging
limbs
that
i
made
my
way
back
again
to
the
royal
pyramid
and
at
last
came
to
my
own
private
chamber
ylga
awaited
me
there
though
at
first
i
did
not
see
her
the
suspicions
of
these
modern
days
had
taken
a
deep
hold
of
the
girl
and
she
must
needs
crouch
in
hiding
till
she
made
sure
it
was
i
who
came
to
the
chamber
and
moreover
that
i
came
alone
oh
frown
at
me
if
you
choose
said
she
sullenly
i
am
past
caring
now
for
your
good
opinion
i
had
heard
so
much
of
deucalion
and
i
thought
i
read
honesty
in
you
when
first
you
came
ashore
but
now
i
know
that
you
are
no
better
than
the
rest
phorenice
offers
you
a
high
place
and
you
marry
her
blithely
to
get
it
and
why
indeed
should
you
not
marry
her
people
say
she
is
pretty
and
i
know
she
can
be
warm
i
have
seen
her
warm
and
languishing
to
scores
of
men
she
is
clever
too
with
her
eyes
is
our
great
empress
i
grant
her
that
and
as
for
you
it
tickles
you
to
be
i
think
you
are
a
very
silly
woman
i
said
if
you
flatter
yourself
it
matters
a
rap
to
me
whom
you
marry
you
are
letting
conceit
run
away
with
listen
i
said
i
did
not
ask
you
here
to
make
foolish
speeches
which
seem
largely
beyond
my
comprehension
i
asked
you
to
help
me
do
a
service
to
one
of
your
own
she
stared
at
me
wonderingly
i
do
not
it
rests
largely
with
you
as
to
whether
nais
dies
or
whether
she
is
thrown
into
a
sleep
from
which
she
may
waken
on
some
later
and
more
happy
nais
she
gasped
my
twin
nais
she
is
not
here
she
is
out
in
the
camp
with
those
nasty
rebels
who
bite
against
the
city
walls
if
indeed
still
she
nais
your
sister
is
near
us
in
the
royal
pyramid
this
minute
and
under
guard
though
where
i
do
not
and
with
that
i
told
her
all
that
had
passed
since
the
girl
was
brought
up
a
prisoner
in
the
galley
of
that
foolish
fawning
captain
of
the
port
the
empress
has
decreed
that
nais
shall
be
buried
alive
under
a
throne
of
granite
which
i
am
to
build
for
her
and
buried
she
will
assuredly
be
yet
i
have
a
kindness
for
nais
which
you
may
guess
at
if
you
choose
and
i
am
minded
to
send
her
into
a
sleep
such
as
only
we
higher
priests
know
of
from
which
at
some
future
day
she
may
possibly
so
it
is
nais
and
not
phorenice
and
not
not
any
other
yes
it
is
nais
i
marry
the
empress
because
zaemon
who
is
mouthpiece
to
the
high
council
of
the
priests
has
ordered
it
for
the
good
of
atlantis
but
my
inwards
remain
still
cold
towards
almost
i
hate
poor
nais
your
vengeance
would
be
easy
do
not
tell
me
where
she
is
gaoled
and
i
shall
not
dare
to
ask
even
to
give
nais
a
further
span
of
life
i
can
not
risk
making
inquiries
for
her
cell
when
there
is
a
chance
that
those
who
tell
me
might
carry
news
to
the
empress
and
so
cause
more
trouble
for
this
poor
and
why
should
i
not
carry
the
news
and
so
bring
myself
into
favour
again
i
tell
you
that
being
to
phorenice
and
second
woman
in
the
kingdom
is
a
thing
that
not
many
would
cast
lightly
i
looked
her
between
eyes
and
smiled
i
have
no
fear
there
you
will
not
betray
me
ylga
neither
will
you
sell
i
seem
to
remember
very
small
love
for
this
same
nais
just
now
she
said
bitterly
but
you
are
right
about
that
other
matter
i
shall
not
buy
myself
back
at
your
expense
oh
i
am
a
fool
i
know
and
you
can
give
me
no
thanks
that
i
care
about
but
there
is
no
other
way
i
can
then
let
us
fritter
no
more
time
go
you
out
now
and
find
where
nais
is
gaoled
and
bring
me
news
how
i
can
say
ten
words
to
her
and
press
a
certain
matter
into
her
she
bowed
her
head
and
left
the
chamber
and
for
long
enough
i
was
alone
i
sat
down
on
the
couch
and
rested
wearily
against
the
wall
my
bones
ached
my
eyes
ached
and
most
of
all
my
inwards
ached
i
had
thought
to
myself
that
a
man
who
makes
his
life
sufficiently
busy
will
find
no
leisure
for
these
pains
which
assault
frailer
folk
but
a
philosophy
like
this
which
carried
one
well
in
yucatan
showed
poorly
enough
when
one
tried
it
here
at
home
but
that
there
was
duty
ahead
and
the
order
of
the
high
council
to
be
carried
into
effect
the
bleakness
of
the
prospect
would
have
daunted
me
and
i
would
have
prayed
the
gods
then
to
spare
me
further
life
and
take
me
unto
themselves
ylga
came
back
at
last
and
i
got
up
and
went
quickly
after
her
as
she
led
down
a
maze
of
passages
and
alleyways
there
has
been
no
care
spared
over
her
guarding
she
whispered
as
we
halted
once
to
move
a
stone
the
officer
of
the
guard
is
an
old
lover
of
mine
and
i
raised
his
hopes
to
the
burning
point
again
by
a
dozen
words
but
when
i
wanted
to
see
his
prisoner
there
he
was
as
firm
as
brass
i
told
him
she
was
my
sister
but
that
did
not
move
him
i
offered
him
oh
deucalion
it
makes
me
blush
to
think
of
the
things
i
did
offer
to
that
man
but
there
was
no
stirring
him
he
has
watched
the
tormentors
so
many
times
that
there
is
no
tempting
him
into
touch
of
their
if
you
have
failed
why
bring
me
out
here
oh
i
am
not
inveigling
you
into
a
lover
s
walk
with
myself
sir
you
tickle
yourself
when
you
think
your
society
is
so
pleasant
as
come
girl
tell
me
then
what
it
is
if
my
temper
is
short
credit
it
against
my
i
have
carried
out
my
lord
s
commands
in
part
i
know
the
cell
where
nais
lives
and
i
have
had
speech
with
her
though
not
through
the
door
and
moreover
i
have
not
seen
her
or
touched
her
your
riddles
are
beyond
me
ylga
but
if
there
is
a
chance
let
us
get
on
and
have
this
business
we
are
at
the
place
now
said
she
with
a
hard
little
laugh
and
if
you
kneel
on
the
floor
you
will
find
an
airshaft
and
nais
will
answer
you
from
the
lower
end
for
myself
i
will
leave
you
i
have
a
delicacy
in
hearing
what
you
want
to
say
to
my
sister
i
thank
you
i
said
i
will
not
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
this
you
may
keep
your
thanks
she
said
bitterly
and
walked
away
into
the
shadows
i
knelt
on
the
floor
of
the
gallery
and
found
the
air
passage
with
my
hand
and
then
putting
my
lips
to
it
whispered
for
nais
the
answer
came
on
the
instant
muffled
and
quiet
i
knew
my
lord
would
come
for
a
what
the
empress
said
has
to
be
you
understand
my
dear
it
is
for
have
i
reproached
my
lord
by
word
or
glance
i
myself
am
bidden
to
place
you
in
the
hollow
between
the
stones
and
i
must
do
then
my
last
sleep
will
be
a
sweet
one
i
could
not
ask
to
be
touched
by
pleasanter
but
it
mayhap
that
a
day
will
come
when
she
whom
you
know
of
will
be
suffered
by
the
high
gods
to
live
on
this
land
of
atlantis
no
if
my
lord
will
cherish
my
poor
memory
when
he
is
free
again
i
shall
be
grateful
he
might
if
he
chose
write
them
on
the
stones
here
was
buried
a
maid
who
died
gladly
for
the
good
of
atlantis
even
though
she
knew
that
the
man
she
so
dearly
loved
was
husband
to
her
you
must
not
die
i
whispered
my
breast
is
near
broken
at
the
very
thought
of
it
and
for
respite
we
must
trust
to
the
ancient
knowledge
which
in
its
day
has
been
sent
out
from
the
ark
of
the
i
took
the
green
waxy
ball
in
my
fingers
and
stretched
them
down
the
crooked
to
the
full
of
my
i
have
somewhat
for
you
here
reach
up
and
try
to
catch
it
from
i
heard
the
faint
rustle
of
her
arm
as
it
swept
against
the
masonry
and
then
the
ball
was
taken
over
into
her
grasp
gods
what
a
thrill
went
through
me
when
the
fingers
of
nais
touched
mine
i
could
not
see
her
because
of
the
crookedness
of
the
shaft
but
that
faint
touch
of
her
was
exquisite
i
have
it
she
whispered
and
what
now
dear
you
will
hide
the
thing
in
your
garment
and
when
the
upper
stone
closes
down
upon
you
and
the
light
is
gone
then
you
will
take
it
between
your
lips
and
let
it
dissolve
as
it
will
sleep
will
take
you
my
darling
then
and
the
high
gods
will
watch
over
you
even
though
centuries
pass
before
you
are
if
deucalion
does
not
wake
me
i
shall
pray
never
again
to
open
an
eye
and
now
go
my
lord
and
my
dear
they
watch
me
here
constantly
and
i
would
not
have
you
harmed
by
being
brought
to
yes
i
must
go
my
sweetheart
it
will
not
do
to
have
our
scheme
spoiled
by
a
foolish
loitering
may
the
most
high
gods
attend
your
rest
and
if
the
sacrifice
we
make
finds
favour
may
they
grant
us
meeting
here
again
on
earth
before
we
meet
as
we
must
when
our
time
is
done
and
they
take
us
up
to
their
own
amen
she
whispered
back
and
then
kiss
your
fingers
dear
and
thrust
them
down
to
i
did
that
and
for
an
instant
felt
her
fondle
them
down
the
crook
of
the
airshaft
out
of
sight
and
then
heard
her
withdraw
her
little
hand
and
kiss
it
fondly
then
again
she
kissed
her
own
fingers
and
stretched
them
up
and
i
took
up
the
virtue
of
that
parting
kiss
on
my
and
pressed
it
sacredly
to
my
lips
living
sleeping
or
dead
always
my
darling
she
whispered
and
then
before
i
could
answer
she
whispered
again
go
they
are
coming
for
and
so
i
went
knowing
that
i
could
do
no
more
to
help
her
then
and
knowing
that
all
our
schemes
would
be
spilt
if
any
eye
spied
upon
me
as
i
lay
there
beside
the
air
shaft
but
my
chest
was
like
to
have
split
with
the
dull
helpless
anguish
that
was
in
it
as
i
made
my
way
back
to
my
chamber
through
the
mazy
alleys
of
the
pyramid
do
not
look
upon
mine
eyes
dear
when
the
time
comes
had
been
her
last
command
or
they
will
tell
a
tale
which
phorenice
being
a
woman
would
read
remember
we
make
these
small
denials
not
for
our
own
likings
but
for
atlantis
which
is
mother
to
us
the
burying
alive
of
nais
there
is
no
denying
that
the
wishes
of
phorenice
were
carried
into
quick
effect
in
the
city
of
atlantis
her
modern
theory
was
that
the
country
and
all
therein
existed
only
for
the
good
of
the
empress
and
when
she
had
a
desire
no
cost
could
possibly
be
too
great
in
its
carrying
out
she
had
given
forth
her
edict
concerning
the
burying
alive
of
nais
and
though
the
words
were
that
i
was
to
build
the
throne
of
stone
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
the
manual
labour
was
to
be
done
for
me
by
others
heralds
made
the
proclamation
in
every
ward
of
the
city
and
masons
labourers
stonecutters
sculptors
engineers
and
architects
took
hands
from
whatever
was
occupying
them
for
the
moment
and
hastened
to
the
rendezvous
the
architects
chose
a
chief
who
gave
directions
and
the
lesser
architects
and
the
engineers
saw
these
carried
into
effect
any
material
within
the
walls
of
the
city
on
which
they
set
their
seal
was
taken
at
once
without
payment
or
compensation
and
as
the
blocks
of
stone
they
chose
were
the
most
monstrous
that
could
be
got
they
were
forced
to
demolish
no
few
buildings
to
give
them
passage
i
have
before
spoken
of
the
modern
rage
for
erecting
new
palaces
and
pyramids
and
even
though
at
the
moment
an
army
of
rebels
was
battering
with
war
engines
at
the
city
walls
the
building
guilds
were
steadily
at
work
and
their
skill
with
phorenice
s
marvellous
invention
to
aid
them
was
constantly
on
the
increase
true
they
could
not
move
such
massive
blocks
of
stone
as
those
which
the
early
gods
planted
for
the
sacred
circle
of
our
lord
the
sun
but
they
had
got
rams
and
trucks
and
cranes
which
could
handle
amazing
bulks
the
throne
was
to
be
erected
in
the
open
square
before
the
royal
pyramid
seven
tiers
of
stone
were
there
for
a
groundwork
each
a
deep
and
each
cut
in
the
front
with
three
steps
in
the
uppermost
layer
was
a
cavity
made
to
hold
the
body
of
nais
and
above
this
was
poised
the
vast
block
which
formed
the
seat
of
the
throne
itself
throughout
the
night
to
the
light
of
torches
relay
after
relay
of
the
stonecutters
and
the
masons
and
the
sweating
labourers
had
toiled
over
bringing
up
the
stone
and
dressing
it
into
fit
shape
and
laying
it
in
due
position
and
the
engineers
had
built
machines
for
lifting
and
the
architects
had
proved
that
each
stone
lay
in
its
just
and
perfect
place
whips
cracked
and
men
fainted
with
the
labour
but
so
soon
as
one
was
incapable
another
pressed
forward
into
his
place
no
delay
was
brooked
when
phorenice
had
said
her
wish
and
finally
as
the
square
began
to
fill
with
people
come
to
gape
at
the
pageant
of
the
chippings
and
the
scaffolding
were
cleared
away
and
with
it
the
bodies
of
some
of
workmen
who
had
died
from
accidents
or
their
exertions
during
the
building
and
there
stood
the
throne
splendid
in
its
carvings
and
all
ready
for
completion
the
lower
part
stood
more
than
two
above
the
ground
and
no
stone
of
its
courses
weighed
less
than
twenty
men
the
upper
part
was
double
the
weight
of
any
of
these
and
was
carved
so
that
the
royal
snake
encircled
the
chair
and
the
great
hooded
head
overshadowed
it
but
at
present
the
upper
part
was
not
on
its
bed
being
held
up
high
by
lifting
rams
for
what
purposes
all
men
knew
it
was
to
face
this
scene
then
that
i
came
out
from
the
royal
pyramid
at
the
summons
of
the
chamberlains
in
the
cool
of
next
morning
each
great
man
who
had
come
there
before
me
had
and
trumpeters
to
proclaim
his
presence
the
middle
classes
were
in
all
their
bravery
of
apparel
and
even
poor
squalid
creatures
with
ribs
of
hunger
showing
through
their
dusty
skins
had
turbans
and
wisps
of
colour
wrapped
about
their
heads
to
mark
the
gaiety
of
the
day
the
trumpets
proclaimed
my
coming
and
the
people
shouted
welcome
and
with
the
gorgeous
chamberlains
walking
backwards
in
advance
i
went
across
to
a
scarlet
awning
that
had
been
prepared
and
took
my
seat
upon
the
cushions
beneath
it
and
then
came
phorenice
my
bride
that
was
to
be
that
day
fresh
from
sleep
and
glorious
in
her
splendid
beauty
she
was
borne
out
from
the
pyramid
in
an
open
litter
of
gold
and
ivory
by
fantastic
savages
from
europe
her
own
refinement
of
feature
being
thrown
up
into
all
the
higher
relief
by
contrast
with
their
brutish
ugliness
one
could
hear
the
people
draw
a
deep
breath
of
delight
as
their
eyes
first
fell
upon
her
and
it
is
easy
to
believe
there
was
not
a
man
in
that
crowd
which
thronged
the
square
who
did
not
envy
me
her
choice
nor
was
there
a
soul
present
unless
ylga
was
there
somewhere
veiled
who
could
by
any
stretch
imagine
that
i
was
not
overjoyed
in
winning
so
lovely
a
wife
for
myself
i
summoned
up
all
the
iron
of
my
training
to
guard
the
expression
of
my
face
we
were
here
on
ceremonial
a
ghastly
enough
affair
throughout
all
its
acts
if
you
choose
but
still
ceremonial
and
i
was
minded
to
show
phorenice
a
grand
manner
that
would
leave
her
nothing
to
cavil
at
after
all
that
had
been
gone
through
and
endured
i
did
not
intend
a
great
scheme
to
be
shattered
by
letting
my
agony
and
pain
show
themselves
in
either
a
shaking
hand
or
a
twitching
cheek
when
it
came
to
the
point
i
told
myself
i
would
lay
the
living
body
of
my
love
in
the
hollow
beneath
the
stone
as
calmly
and
with
as
little
outward
emotion
as
though
i
had
been
a
mere
priest
carrying
out
the
burial
of
some
dead
stranger
and
she
on
her
part
would
not
i
knew
betray
our
secret
with
her
too
it
was
truly
before
all
i
think
it
spared
a
pang
to
find
that
there
was
to
be
no
mockery
or
flippancy
in
what
went
forward
all
was
solemn
and
impressive
and
though
a
certain
grandeur
and
sombreness
which
bit
deep
into
my
breast
was
lost
to
the
vulgar
crowd
i
fancy
that
the
outward
shape
of
the
double
sacrifice
they
witnessed
that
day
would
not
be
forgotten
by
any
of
them
although
the
inner
meaning
of
it
all
was
completely
hidden
from
their
minds
when
it
suited
her
fancy
none
could
be
more
strict
on
the
ritual
of
a
ceremony
than
this
empress
and
it
appeared
that
on
this
occasion
she
had
given
command
that
all
things
were
to
be
carried
out
with
the
rigid
exactness
and
pomp
of
the
older
manner
so
she
was
borne
up
by
her
europeans
to
the
scarlet
awning
and
i
handed
her
to
the
ground
she
seated
herself
on
the
cushions
and
beckoned
me
to
her
side
entwining
her
fingers
with
mine
as
has
always
been
the
custom
with
rulers
of
atlantis
and
their
consorts
and
there
before
us
as
we
sat
a
body
of
soldiery
marched
up
and
opening
out
showed
nais
in
their
midst
she
had
a
collar
of
metal
round
her
neck
with
chains
depending
from
it
firmly
held
by
a
brace
of
guards
so
that
she
should
not
run
in
upon
the
spears
of
the
escort
and
thus
get
a
quick
and
easy
death
which
is
often
the
custom
of
those
condemned
to
the
more
lingering
punishments
but
it
was
pleasant
to
see
that
she
still
wore
her
clothing
raiment
whether
of
fabric
or
skin
has
its
value
and
custom
has
always
given
the
garments
of
the
condemned
to
the
soldiers
guarding
them
so
as
nais
was
not
stripped
i
could
not
but
see
that
some
one
had
given
moneys
to
the
guards
as
a
recompense
and
in
this
i
thought
i
saw
the
hand
of
ylga
and
felt
a
gratitude
towards
her
the
soldiers
brought
her
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
pavilion
s
shade
and
she
was
bidden
prostrate
herself
before
the
empress
and
this
she
wisely
did
and
so
avoided
rough
handling
and
force
her
face
was
pale
but
showed
neither
fear
nor
defiance
and
her
eyes
were
calm
and
natural
she
was
remembering
what
was
due
to
atlantis
and
i
was
thrilled
with
love
and
pride
as
i
watched
her
but
outwardly
i
too
was
impassive
as
a
man
of
stone
and
though
i
knew
that
phorenice
s
eye
was
on
my
face
there
was
never
anything
on
it
from
first
to
last
that
i
would
not
have
had
her
see
nais
said
the
empress
you
have
eaten
from
my
platter
when
you
were
and
drunk
from
my
cup
and
what
was
yours
i
gave
you
you
should
have
had
more
than
gratitude
you
should
have
had
knowledge
also
that
the
arm
of
the
empress
was
long
and
her
hand
consummately
heavy
but
it
seems
that
you
have
neither
of
these
things
and
moreover
you
have
tried
to
take
a
certain
matter
that
the
empress
has
set
apart
for
herself
you
were
offered
pardon
on
terms
and
you
rejected
it
you
were
foolish
but
it
is
a
day
now
when
i
am
inclined
to
clemency
presently
seated
on
that
carved
throne
of
granite
which
he
has
built
me
yonder
i
shall
take
my
lord
deucalion
to
husband
give
me
a
plain
word
that
you
are
sorry
girl
and
name
a
man
whom
you
would
choose
and
i
will
remember
the
brightness
of
the
occasion
you
shall
be
pardoned
and
wed
before
we
rise
from
these
i
will
not
wed
she
said
quietly
think
for
the
last
time
nais
of
what
is
the
other
choice
you
will
be
taken
warm
and
quick
and
beautiful
as
you
stand
there
this
minute
and
laid
in
the
hollow
place
that
is
made
beneath
the
deucalion
that
is
to
be
my
husband
will
lay
you
in
that
awful
bed
as
a
symbol
that
so
shall
perish
all
phorenice
s
enemies
and
then
he
will
release
the
rams
and
lower
the
upper
stone
into
place
and
the
world
shall
see
your
face
no
more
look
at
the
bright
sky
nais
fill
your
chest
with
the
sweet
warm
air
and
then
think
of
what
this
death
will
mean
believe
me
girl
i
do
not
want
to
make
you
an
example
unless
you
force
i
will
not
wed
said
the
prisoner
quietly
the
empress
loosed
her
fingers
from
my
arm
and
lay
back
against
the
cushions
if
the
girl
presumes
on
our
old
familiarity
or
thinks
that
i
jest
show
her
now
deucalion
that
i
do
the
empress
is
far
from
jesting
i
said
i
will
do
this
thing
because
it
is
the
wish
of
the
empress
that
it
should
be
done
and
because
it
is
the
command
of
the
empress
that
a
symbol
of
it
shall
remain
for
ever
as
an
example
for
others
lead
your
prisoner
to
the
the
soldiers
wheeled
and
the
two
guards
with
the
chains
of
the
collar
which
was
on
the
neck
of
nais
prepared
to
put
out
force
to
drag
her
up
the
steps
but
she
walked
with
them
willingly
and
with
a
colour
unchanged
and
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
made
obeisance
to
the
empress
and
followed
them
before
all
those
ten
thousand
eyes
we
two
made
no
display
of
emotion
then
not
only
for
atlantis
sake
but
also
because
both
nais
and
i
had
a
nicety
and
a
pride
in
our
natures
we
were
not
as
phorenice
to
flaunt
endearments
before
others
yet
when
i
had
bidden
the
guards
unhasp
the
collar
which
held
the
prisoner
s
neck
and
clapped
my
arms
around
her
showing
all
the
roughness
of
one
who
has
no
mind
that
his
captive
shall
escape
or
even
unduly
struggle
a
thrill
gushed
through
me
so
potent
that
i
was
like
to
have
fainted
and
it
was
only
by
supreme
strain
of
will
that
i
held
unbrokenly
on
with
the
ceremonial
i
who
had
never
embraced
a
woman
with
aught
but
the
arm
of
roughness
before
now
held
pressed
to
me
one
whom
i
loved
with
an
infinite
tenderness
and
the
revelation
of
how
love
can
come
out
and
link
with
love
was
almost
my
undoing
yet
outwardly
nais
made
so
sign
but
lay
in
my
arms
as
any
woman
does
that
is
being
borne
away
by
a
spoiler
i
trod
with
her
to
the
uppermost
step
the
vast
overhanging
us
and
then
so
that
all
of
those
who
were
gazing
from
the
sides
of
the
pyramids
and
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
round
might
see
though
we
were
beyond
phorenice
s
view
i
used
a
force
that
was
brutal
in
dragging
her
across
the
level
and
putting
her
down
into
the
hollow
and
yet
the
girl
resisted
me
with
no
one
effort
whatever
so
that
the
victim
might
not
struggle
out
and
be
crushed
and
so
gain
an
easy
death
when
the
stone
descended
there
were
brazen
clamps
to
fit
into
grooves
of
the
stones
above
the
hollow
where
she
lay
and
these
i
fitted
in
place
above
her
and
fastened
one
by
one
doing
this
butcher
s
work
with
one
hand
and
still
fiercely
holding
her
down
by
the
other
gods
and
the
sweat
of
agony
dripped
from
me
on
to
the
thirsty
stone
as
i
worked
i
could
not
keep
that
in
i
clamped
and
locked
the
last
two
bars
in
place
and
took
my
brute
s
hand
away
from
her
throat
the
hateful
fingermarks
showed
as
bloodless
furrows
in
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
for
the
life
of
me
yes
even
for
the
fate
of
atlantis
i
could
not
help
dropping
my
glance
upon
her
face
but
she
was
stronger
than
i
she
gave
me
no
last
look
she
kept
her
eyes
steadfastly
fixed
on
the
cruel
stone
above
and
so
i
left
her
knowing
that
it
was
best
not
to
tarry
longer
i
came
out
from
under
the
stone
and
gave
the
sign
to
the
engineers
who
stood
by
the
rams
the
fires
were
taken
away
from
their
sides
and
the
metal
in
them
began
to
contract
and
slowly
the
vast
bulk
of
the
began
to
creep
down
towards
its
bed
but
ah
so
slowly
gods
how
my
soul
was
torn
as
i
watched
and
waited
yet
i
kept
my
face
impassive
overlooking
as
any
officer
might
a
piece
of
work
which
others
were
carrying
out
under
his
direction
and
on
which
his
credit
rested
and
i
stood
gravely
in
my
place
till
the
rams
had
let
the
stone
come
down
on
its
final
resting
place
and
had
been
carried
away
by
the
engineers
and
then
i
went
round
with
the
master
architect
with
his
plumbline
and
level
whilst
he
tested
this
last
piece
of
the
building
and
declared
it
perfect
it
was
a
useless
form
this
last
seeing
that
by
calculation
they
knew
exactly
how
the
stone
must
rest
but
the
guilds
have
their
forms
and
customs
and
on
these
occasions
of
high
ceremonial
they
are
punctiliously
carried
out
because
these
people
wish
always
to
appear
mysterious
and
impressive
to
the
poor
vulgar
folk
who
are
their
inferiors
but
perhaps
i
am
hard
there
on
them
a
man
who
is
needlessly
taken
round
to
plumb
and
duly
level
the
tomb
where
his
love
lies
buried
living
may
perhaps
be
excused
by
the
assessors
on
high
a
little
spirit
of
bitterness
i
had
gone
up
the
steps
to
do
my
hateful
work
a
man
full
of
grief
though
outwardly
unmoved
as
i
came
down
again
i
had
a
feeling
of
incompleteness
it
seemed
as
though
half
my
inwards
had
been
left
behind
with
nais
in
the
hollow
of
the
stone
and
their
place
was
taken
by
a
void
which
ached
wearily
but
still
i
carried
a
passive
face
and
memory
that
before
all
these
private
matters
stood
the
command
of
the
high
council
which
sat
before
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
so
i
went
and
stood
before
phorenice
and
said
the
words
which
the
ancient
forms
prescribed
concerning
the
carrying
out
of
her
wish
then
now
she
said
i
will
give
myself
to
you
as
wife
we
are
not
as
others
you
and
i
deucalion
there
is
a
law
and
a
form
set
down
for
the
marrying
of
these
other
people
but
that
would
be
useless
for
our
purposes
we
will
have
neither
priest
nor
scribe
to
join
us
and
set
down
the
union
i
am
the
law
here
in
atlantis
and
you
soon
will
be
part
of
me
we
will
not
be
demeaned
by
profaner
hands
we
will
make
the
ceremony
for
ourselves
and
for
witnesses
there
are
sufficient
in
waiting
afterwards
the
record
shall
be
cut
deep
in
the
granite
throne
you
have
built
for
me
and
the
lettering
filled
in
with
gold
so
that
it
shall
endure
and
remain
bright
for
the
empress
can
do
no
wrong
i
said
formally
and
took
the
hand
she
offered
me
and
helped
her
to
rise
we
walked
out
from
the
scarlet
awning
into
the
glare
of
the
sunshine
she
leaning
on
me
flushing
and
so
radiantly
lovely
that
the
people
began
to
hail
her
with
rapturous
shouts
of
a
goddess
our
goddess
but
for
me
they
had
no
welcoming
word
i
think
the
set
grimness
of
my
face
both
scared
and
repelled
them
we
went
up
the
steps
which
led
to
the
throne
the
people
still
shouting
and
i
sat
her
in
the
royal
seat
beneath
the
snake
s
outstretched
head
and
she
drew
me
down
to
sit
beside
her
she
raised
her
jewelled
hand
and
a
silence
fell
on
that
great
throng
as
though
the
breath
had
been
suddenly
cut
short
for
all
of
them
then
phorenice
made
proclamation
hear
me
o
my
people
and
hear
me
o
high
gods
from
whom
i
am
come
i
take
this
man
deucalion
to
be
my
husband
to
share
with
me
the
prosperity
of
atlantis
and
join
me
in
guarding
our
great
possession
may
all
our
enemies
perish
as
she
is
now
perishing
above
whom
we
and
then
she
put
her
arms
around
my
neck
and
kissed
me
hotly
on
the
mouth
in
turn
i
also
spoke
hear
me
o
most
high
gods
whose
servant
i
am
and
hear
me
also
o
ye
people
i
take
this
empress
phorenice
to
wife
to
help
with
her
the
prosperity
of
atlantis
and
join
with
her
in
guarding
the
welfare
of
that
great
possession
may
all
the
enemies
of
this
country
perish
as
they
have
perished
in
the
and
then
i
too
who
had
not
been
permitted
by
the
fate
to
touch
the
lips
of
my
love
bestowed
the
first
kiss
i
had
ever
given
woman
to
phorenice
that
was
now
being
made
my
wife
but
we
were
not
completely
linked
yet
a
woman
is
one
and
man
is
one
she
proclaimed
following
for
the
first
time
the
old
form
of
words
but
in
marriage
they
merge
so
that
wife
and
husband
are
no
more
separate
but
one
conjointly
in
token
of
this
we
will
now
make
the
symbolic
joining
together
so
that
all
may
see
and
she
took
her
dagger
and
pricking
the
brawn
on
my
forearm
till
a
head
of
blood
appeared
set
her
red
lips
to
it
and
took
it
into
herself
ah
she
said
with
her
eyes
sparkling
now
you
are
part
of
me
indeed
deucalion
and
i
feel
you
have
strengthened
me
she
pulled
down
the
neck
of
her
robe
let
me
make
you
my
i
pricked
the
rounded
whiteness
of
her
shoulder
gods
when
i
remembered
who
was
beneath
us
as
we
sat
on
that
throne
i
could
have
driven
the
blade
through
to
her
heart
and
then
i
too
put
down
my
lips
and
took
the
drop
of
her
blood
that
was
yielded
to
me
my
tongue
was
dry
my
throat
was
parched
and
my
face
suffused
and
i
thought
i
should
have
choked
but
the
empress
who
was
ordinarily
so
acute
was
misled
then
it
thrills
you
she
cried
it
burns
within
you
like
living
fire
i
have
just
felt
it
by
my
face
deucalion
if
i
had
known
the
pleasure
it
gives
to
be
made
a
wife
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
waited
this
long
for
you
ah
yes
but
with
another
man
i
should
have
had
no
thrill
i
might
have
gone
through
the
ceremony
with
another
but
it
would
have
left
me
cold
well
they
say
this
feeling
comes
to
a
woman
but
once
in
her
time
and
i
would
not
change
it
for
the
glory
of
all
my
conquests
and
the
whirl
of
all
my
she
leaned
in
close
to
me
so
that
the
red
curls
of
her
hair
swept
my
cheek
and
her
breath
came
hot
against
my
mouth
tasted
you
ever
any
sweet
so
delicious
as
this
knowledge
that
we
are
made
one
now
deucalion
past
all
possible
dissolving
i
could
not
lie
to
her
any
more
just
then
the
gods
know
how
honestly
i
had
striven
to
play
the
part
commanded
me
for
atlantis
good
but
there
is
a
limit
to
human
endurance
and
mine
was
reached
i
was
not
all
anger
towards
her
i
had
some
pity
for
this
passion
of
hers
which
had
grown
of
itself
certainly
but
which
i
had
done
nothing
to
check
and
the
indecent
frankness
with
which
it
was
displayed
was
only
part
of
the
livery
of
potentates
who
flaunt
what
meaner
folk
would
coyly
hide
but
always
before
my
eyes
was
a
picture
of
the
girl
on
whom
her
jealousy
had
taken
such
a
bitter
vengeance
and
to
invent
spurious
lover
s
talk
then
was
a
thing
my
tongue
refused
to
do
words
are
poor
things
i
said
and
i
am
a
man
unused
to
women
and
have
but
a
small
stock
of
any
phrases
except
the
dryest
remember
phorenice
a
week
agone
i
did
not
know
what
love
was
and
now
that
i
have
learned
the
lesson
somewhat
of
the
suddenest
the
language
remains
still
to
come
to
me
my
inwards
speak
indeed
they
are
full
of
speech
but
i
can
not
translate
into
bald
cold
words
what
they
and
here
surely
the
high
gods
took
pity
on
my
tied
tongue
and
my
misery
and
made
an
opportunity
for
bringing
the
ceremony
to
an
end
a
man
ran
into
the
square
shouting
and
showing
a
wound
that
dripped
and
presently
all
that
vast
crowd
which
stood
on
the
pavements
and
the
sides
of
the
pyramids
and
the
roofs
of
the
temples
took
up
the
cry
and
began
to
feel
for
their
weapons
the
rebels
are
in
they
have
burrowed
a
path
into
the
city
they
have
killed
the
and
taken
a
gate
they
are
putting
the
whole
place
to
the
storm
they
will
presently
leave
no
poor
soul
of
us
here
alive
there
then
was
a
termination
of
our
marriage
cooings
with
rebels
merely
biting
at
the
walls
it
was
fine
to
put
strong
trust
in
the
defences
and
easy
to
affect
contempt
for
the
besiegers
powers
and
to
keep
the
business
of
pageants
and
state
craft
and
marryings
turning
on
easy
wheels
but
with
rebel
soldiers
already
inside
the
city
and
hordes
of
others
doubtless
pressing
on
their
heels
the
affairs
took
a
different
light
it
was
no
moment
for
further
delay
and
phorenice
was
the
first
to
admit
it
the
glow
that
had
been
in
her
eyes
changed
to
the
glare
of
the
fighter
as
the
fellow
who
had
run
up
squalled
out
his
tidings
i
stood
and
stretched
my
chest
i
seemed
in
need
of
air
here
i
said
is
work
that
i
can
understand
more
clearly
i
will
go
and
sweep
this
rabble
back
to
their
burrows
but
not
alone
sir
i
come
too
it
is
my
city
still
nay
sir
we
are
too
newly
wed
to
be
parted
have
your
will
i
said
and
together
we
went
down
the
steps
of
the
throne
to
the
pavement
below
under
my
breath
i
said
a
farewell
to
nais
our
met
us
with
weapons
and
we
stepped
into
litters
and
the
slaves
took
us
off
hot
foot
the
wounded
man
who
had
first
brought
the
news
had
fallen
in
a
faint
and
no
more
tidings
was
to
be
got
from
him
but
the
growing
din
of
the
fight
gave
us
the
general
direction
and
presently
we
began
to
meet
knots
of
people
who
dwelt
near
the
place
of
irruption
running
away
in
wild
panic
loaded
down
with
their
household
goods
it
was
useless
to
stop
these
as
fight
they
could
not
and
if
they
had
stayed
they
would
merely
have
been
slaughtered
like
flies
and
would
in
all
likelihood
have
impeded
our
own
soldiery
and
so
we
let
them
run
screaming
on
their
blind
way
but
forced
the
litters
through
them
with
but
very
little
regard
for
their
coward
convenience
now
the
advantage
of
the
rebels
when
it
came
to
be
looked
upon
by
a
soldier
s
eye
was
a
thing
of
little
enough
importance
they
had
driven
a
tunnel
from
behind
a
covering
mound
beneath
the
walls
and
had
opened
it
cleverly
enough
through
the
floor
of
a
house
they
had
come
through
into
this
collecting
their
numbers
under
its
shelter
and
doubtless
hoping
that
the
marriage
of
the
empress
of
which
spies
had
given
them
information
would
sap
the
watchfulness
of
the
city
guards
but
it
seems
they
were
discovered
and
attacked
before
they
were
thoroughly
ready
to
emerge
and
as
a
fine
body
of
troops
were
barracked
near
the
spot
their
extermination
would
have
been
merely
a
matter
of
time
even
if
we
had
not
come
up
it
did
not
take
a
trained
eye
long
to
decide
on
this
and
phorenice
with
a
laugh
lay
back
on
the
cushions
of
the
litter
and
returned
her
weapons
to
the
who
came
panting
up
to
receive
them
we
grow
nervous
with
our
married
life
my
deucalion
she
said
we
are
fearful
lest
this
happiness
be
taken
from
us
too
but
i
was
not
to
be
robbed
of
my
in
this
wise
let
me
crave
a
wedding
gift
of
you
i
said
it
is
yours
before
you
name
then
give
me
troops
and
set
me
wide
a
city
gate
a
mile
away
from
you
can
gather
five
hundred
as
you
go
from
here
to
the
gate
taking
two
hundred
of
those
that
are
here
if
you
want
more
they
must
be
fetched
from
other
barracks
along
the
walls
but
where
is
your
plan
why
my
poor
strategy
teaches
me
this
these
foolish
rebels
have
set
all
their
hopes
on
this
mine
and
all
their
excitement
on
its
present
success
if
they
are
kept
occupied
here
by
a
phorenice
who
will
give
them
some
dainty
fighting
without
checking
them
unduly
they
will
press
on
to
the
attack
and
forget
all
else
and
never
so
much
as
dream
of
a
sortie
and
meanwhile
a
deucalion
with
his
troop
will
march
out
of
the
city
well
away
from
here
without
tuck
of
drum
or
blare
of
trumpet
and
fall
most
unpleasantly
upon
their
rear
after
which
a
phorenice
will
burn
the
house
here
at
the
mine
s
head
which
is
of
wood
and
straw
thatched
to
discourage
further
egress
and
either
go
to
the
walls
to
watch
the
fight
from
there
or
sally
out
also
and
spur
on
the
rout
as
her
fancy
your
scheme
is
so
pretty
i
would
i
could
rob
you
of
it
for
my
own
credit
s
sake
and
as
it
is
i
must
kiss
you
for
your
cleverness
but
you
got
my
word
first
you
naughty
fellow
and
you
shall
have
the
men
and
do
as
you
ask
eh
sir
this
is
a
sad
beginning
of
our
wedded
life
if
you
begin
to
rob
your
little
wife
of
all
the
sweets
of
conquest
from
the
she
took
back
the
weapons
and
target
she
had
given
to
the
and
stepped
over
the
side
of
the
litter
to
the
ground
but
at
least
she
said
if
you
are
going
to
fight
you
shall
have
troops
that
will
do
credit
to
my
drill
and
thereupon
proceeded
to
tell
off
the
companies
of
who
were
to
accompany
me
she
left
herself
few
enough
to
stem
the
influx
of
rebels
who
poured
ceaselessly
in
through
the
tunnel
but
as
i
had
seen
with
phorenice
heavy
odds
added
only
to
her
enjoyment
but
for
the
empress
i
will
own
at
the
time
to
have
given
little
enough
of
thought
my
own
proper
griefs
were
raw
within
me
and
i
thirsted
for
that
forgetfulness
of
all
else
which
battle
gives
so
that
for
awhile
i
might
have
a
rest
from
their
gnawings
it
made
my
blood
run
freer
to
hear
once
more
the
tramp
of
practised
troops
behind
me
and
when
all
had
been
collected
we
marched
out
through
a
gate
of
the
city
and
presently
were
charging
through
and
through
the
straggling
rear
of
the
enemy
by
the
gods
for
the
moment
even
nais
was
blotted
from
my
wearied
mind
never
had
i
loved
more
to
let
my
fierceness
run
madly
riot
never
have
i
gloated
more
abundantly
over
the
terrible
joy
of
battle
nais
must
forgive
my
weakness
in
seeking
to
forget
her
even
for
a
had
that
opportunity
been
denied
me
i
believe
the
agony
of
remembering
would
have
snapped
my
for
always
again
the
gods
make
change
now
it
would
be
tedious
to
tell
how
with
a
handful
of
highly
trained
fighting
men
i
charged
and
recharged
and
finally
broke
up
that
horde
of
rebels
which
outnumbered
us
by
fifteen
times
it
must
be
remembered
that
they
grew
suddenly
in
finding
that
of
all
those
who
went
in
under
the
city
walls
by
the
mine
on
which
they
had
set
such
great
store
none
came
back
and
that
the
sounds
of
panic
which
had
first
broken
out
within
the
city
soon
gave
way
to
cries
of
triumph
and
joy
and
it
must
be
carried
in
memory
also
that
these
wretched
rebels
were
without
training
worthy
of
the
name
were
for
the
most
part
weaponed
very
vilely
and
seeing
that
their
silly
principles
made
each
the
equal
of
his
neighbour
were
practically
without
heads
or
leaders
also
so
when
the
panic
began
it
spread
like
a
malignant
murrain
through
all
their
ragged
ranks
and
there
were
none
to
rally
the
flying
none
to
direct
those
of
more
desperate
bravery
who
stayed
and
fought
my
scheme
of
attack
was
simple
i
hunted
them
without
a
halt
i
and
my
fellows
never
stopped
to
play
the
defensive
we
turned
one
flank
and
charged
through
a
centre
and
then
we
were
harrying
the
other
flank
and
once
more
hacking
our
passage
through
the
solid
mass
and
so
by
constantly
keeping
them
on
the
run
and
in
ignorance
of
whence
would
come
the
next
attack
panic
began
to
grow
amongst
them
and
ferment
till
presently
those
in
the
outer
lines
commenced
to
scurry
away
towards
the
forests
and
the
spoiled
of
the
country
and
those
in
the
inner
packs
were
only
wishful
of
a
chance
to
follow
them
it
was
no
feat
of
arms
this
breaking
up
of
the
rebel
leaguer
and
no
practised
soldier
would
wish
to
claim
it
as
such
it
was
simply
taking
advantage
of
the
chances
of
the
moment
and
as
such
it
was
successful
given
an
open
battle
on
their
own
ground
these
desperate
rebels
would
have
fought
till
none
could
stand
and
by
sheer
ferocious
numbers
would
have
pulled
down
any
trained
troops
that
the
city
could
have
sent
against
them
whether
they
had
advanced
in
phalanx
or
what
formation
you
will
for
it
must
be
remembered
they
were
far
removed
from
cowards
being
atlantean
all
just
as
were
those
within
the
city
and
were
moreover
spurred
to
extraordinary
savageness
and
desperation
by
the
oppression
under
which
they
had
groaned
and
the
wrongs
they
had
been
forced
to
endure
still
as
i
say
the
poor
creatures
were
scattered
and
the
siege
was
raised
from
that
moment
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
the
rebellion
might
be
made
to
end
if
no
unreasonable
harshness
was
used
for
its
final
suppression
too
great
severity
though
perhaps
it
may
be
justly
their
portion
only
drives
such
malcontents
to
further
desperations
now
following
up
these
fugitives
to
make
sure
that
there
was
no
halt
in
their
retreat
and
to
send
the
lesson
of
panic
thoroughly
home
to
them
had
led
us
a
long
distance
from
the
city
walls
and
as
we
had
fought
all
through
the
burning
heat
of
the
day
and
my
men
were
heavily
wearied
i
decided
to
halt
where
we
were
for
the
night
amongst
some
houses
which
would
make
a
temporary
fortification
fortunately
a
drove
of
little
horses
which
had
been
scared
by
some
of
the
rebels
in
their
flight
happened
to
blunder
into
our
lines
and
as
we
killed
five
before
they
were
clear
again
there
was
a
soldier
s
supper
for
us
and
quickly
the
fires
were
lit
and
cooking
it
sentries
paced
the
outskirts
and
made
their
cries
to
one
another
and
the
wounded
sat
by
the
fires
and
dressed
their
hurts
and
with
the
officers
i
talked
over
the
engagements
of
the
day
and
the
methods
of
each
charge
and
the
other
details
of
the
fighting
it
is
the
special
perquisite
of
soldiers
to
dally
over
these
matters
with
gusto
though
they
are
entirely
without
interest
for
laymen
the
hour
drew
on
for
sleep
and
snores
went
up
from
every
side
it
was
clear
that
all
my
officers
were
wearied
out
and
only
continued
the
talk
through
deference
to
their
commander
yet
i
had
a
feverish
dread
of
being
left
alone
again
with
my
thoughts
and
pressed
them
on
with
conversation
remorselessly
but
in
the
end
they
were
saved
the
rudeness
of
dropping
off
into
unconsciousness
during
my
talk
a
sentry
came
up
and
saluted
my
lord
he
reported
there
is
a
woman
come
up
from
the
city
whom
we
have
caught
trying
to
come
into
the
how
is
she
named
she
will
not
has
she
business
she
will
say
none
she
demands
only
to
see
my
bring
her
here
to
the
fire
i
ordered
and
then
on
second
thoughts
remembering
that
the
woman
whoever
she
might
be
had
news
likely
enough
for
my
private
ear
or
otherwise
she
would
not
have
come
to
so
uncouth
a
rendezvous
i
said
to
the
sentry
stay
and
got
up
from
the
ground
beside
the
fire
and
went
with
him
to
the
outer
line
where
is
she
i
asked
my
comrades
are
holding
her
she
might
be
a
wench
belonging
to
these
rebels
with
designs
to
put
a
knife
into
my
lord
s
heart
and
then
we
sentries
would
suffer
the
empress
he
added
simply
seems
to
set
good
store
upon
my
lord
at
present
and
we
know
the
cleverness
of
her
your
thoughtfulness
is
frank
i
said
and
then
he
showed
me
the
woman
she
was
muffled
up
in
hood
and
cloak
but
one
who
loved
nais
as
i
loved
could
not
mistake
the
form
of
ylga
her
twin
sister
because
of
mere
swathings
so
i
told
the
sentries
to
release
her
without
asking
her
for
speech
and
then
led
her
out
from
the
bivouac
beyond
earshot
of
their
lines
it
is
something
of
the
most
pressing
that
has
brought
you
out
here
ylga
you
know
me
then
there
must
be
something
warmer
than
the
ordinary
between
us
two
deucalion
if
you
could
guess
who
walked
beneath
all
these
i
let
that
pass
but
what
s
your
errand
girl
aye
she
said
bitterly
there
s
my
reward
all
your
concern
s
for
the
message
none
for
the
carrier
well
good
my
lord
you
are
husband
to
the
dainty
phorenice
no
this
is
and
true
enough
too
she
will
have
no
more
of
you
divorces
you
spurns
you
thrusts
you
from
her
and
after
the
first
splutter
of
wrath
is
done
then
come
pains
and
the
empress
can
do
no
wrong
i
will
have
you
speak
respectful
words
of
the
oh
be
done
with
that
old
fable
it
sickens
me
the
woman
was
mad
for
love
of
you
and
now
she
s
mad
with
jealousy
she
knows
that
you
gave
nais
some
of
your
priest
s
magic
and
that
she
sleeps
till
you
choose
to
come
and
claim
her
even
though
the
day
be
a
century
from
this
and
if
you
wish
to
know
the
method
of
her
enlightenment
it
is
simple
there
is
another
airshaft
next
to
the
one
down
which
you
did
your
cooing
and
billing
and
that
leads
to
another
cell
in
which
lay
another
prisoner
the
wretch
heard
all
that
passed
and
thought
to
buy
enlargement
by
telling
it
but
his
news
came
a
trifle
stale
it
seems
that
with
the
pressure
of
the
morning
s
ceremonies
they
forgot
to
bring
a
ration
and
when
at
last
his
gaoler
did
remember
him
it
was
rather
late
seeing
that
by
then
phorenice
had
tied
herself
publicly
to
a
husband
and
poor
nais
had
doubtless
eaten
her
green
drug
however
the
fools
must
needs
try
and
barter
his
tale
for
what
it
would
fetch
and
as
was
natural
had
such
a
silly
head
chopped
off
for
his
pains
and
after
that
your
phorenice
behaved
as
you
may
guess
and
now
you
may
thank
me
sir
for
coming
to
warn
you
not
to
go
back
to
but
i
shall
go
back
and
if
the
empress
chooses
to
cut
my
head
also
from
its
proper
column
that
is
as
the
high
gods
you
are
more
sick
of
life
than
i
thought
but
i
think
sir
our
phorenice
judges
your
case
very
accurately
it
was
permitted
me
to
hear
the
outbursting
of
this
lady
s
rage
shall
i
hew
off
his
head
said
she
pah
shall
i
give
him
over
to
my
tormentors
and
stand
by
whilst
they
do
their
worst
he
would
not
wrinkle
his
brow
at
their
fiercest
efforts
no
he
must
have
a
heavier
punishment
than
any
of
these
and
one
also
which
will
endure
i
shall
lop
off
his
right
hand
and
his
left
foot
so
that
he
may
be
a
fighting
man
no
longer
and
then
i
shall
drive
him
forth
crippled
into
the
dangerous
lands
where
he
may
learn
fear
the
beasts
shall
hunt
him
the
fires
of
the
ground
shall
spoil
his
rest
he
shall
know
hunger
and
he
shall
breathe
bad
air
and
all
the
while
he
shall
remember
that
i
have
nais
near
me
living
and
locked
in
her
coffin
of
stone
to
play
with
as
i
choose
and
to
give
over
to
what
insults
may
come
to
my
that
is
what
she
said
deucalion
now
i
ask
you
again
will
you
go
back
to
meet
her
vengeance
no
i
said
it
is
no
part
of
my
plan
to
be
mutilated
and
left
to
so
being
a
woman
of
some
sense
i
judged
and
moreover
having
some
small
kindness
still
left
for
you
i
have
taken
it
upon
myself
to
make
a
plan
for
your
further
movement
which
may
fall
in
with
your
whim
does
the
name
of
tob
come
back
to
your
memory
one
who
was
captain
of
tatho
s
navy
that
same
tob
a
gruff
rude
fellow
and
smelling
vile
of
tar
but
seeming
to
have
a
sturdy
honesty
of
his
own
tob
sails
away
this
night
for
parts
unknown
presumably
to
found
a
kingdom
with
tob
for
king
it
seems
he
can
find
little
enough
to
earn
at
his
craft
in
atlantis
these
latter
days
and
has
scruples
at
seeing
his
wife
and
young
ones
hungry
he
told
me
this
at
the
harbour
side
when
i
put
my
neck
under
the
axe
by
saying
i
wanted
carriage
for
you
sir
and
so
having
me
under
his
thumb
he
was
perhaps
more
than
usual
you
seem
to
have
made
a
fine
impression
on
tob
deucalion
he
said
i
repeat
his
hearty
disrespect
you
were
just
the
recruit
he
wanted
but
whether
you
joined
him
or
not
he
would
go
to
the
nether
gods
to
do
you
by
the
fellow
s
side
i
gained
some
experience
in
fighting
the
greater
sea
well
go
and
do
it
again
believe
me
sir
it
is
your
only
chance
it
would
grieve
me
much
to
hear
the
hiss
on
your
stumps
i
bargained
with
tob
to
get
clear
of
the
harbour
forts
before
the
chain
was
up
for
the
night
and
as
he
is
a
very
daring
fellow
with
no
fear
of
navigating
under
the
darkness
he
himself
said
he
would
come
to
a
point
of
the
shore
which
we
agreed
upon
and
there
await
you
come
deucalion
let
me
lead
you
to
the
my
girl
i
said
i
see
i
owe
you
many
thanks
for
what
you
have
done
on
my
poor
oh
your
thanks
she
said
you
may
keep
them
i
did
not
come
out
here
in
the
dark
and
the
dangers
for
mere
thanks
though
i
knew
well
enough
there
would
be
little
else
she
plucked
at
my
now
show
me
your
walking
pace
sir
they
will
begin
to
want
your
countenance
in
the
camp
directly
and
we
need
hanker
after
no
too
narrow
inquiries
for
what
s
so
thereon
we
set
off
ylga
and
i
leaving
the
lights
of
the
bivouac
behind
us
and
she
showed
the
way
whilst
i
carried
my
weapons
ready
to
ward
off
attacks
whether
from
beasts
or
from
men
few
words
were
passed
between
us
except
those
which
had
concern
with
the
dangers
natural
to
the
way
once
only
did
we
touch
one
another
and
that
was
where
a
bridged
a
rivulet
of
scalding
water
which
flowed
from
a
towards
the
sea
are
you
sure
of
footing
i
asked
for
the
night
was
dark
and
the
heat
of
the
water
would
peel
the
flesh
from
the
bones
if
one
slipped
into
it
no
she
said
i
am
not
and
reached
out
and
took
my
hand
i
helped
her
over
and
then
loosed
my
grip
and
she
sighed
and
slowly
slipped
her
hand
away
then
on
again
we
went
in
silence
side
by
side
hour
after
hour
and
league
after
league
but
at
last
we
topped
a
rise
and
below
us
through
the
trees
i
could
see
the
gleam
of
the
great
estuary
on
which
the
city
of
atlantis
stands
the
ground
was
soggy
and
wet
beneath
us
the
trees
were
full
of
barbs
and
spines
the
way
was
monstrous
hard
ylga
s
breath
was
beginning
to
come
in
laboured
pants
but
when
i
offered
to
take
her
arm
and
help
her
as
some
return
against
what
she
had
done
for
me
she
repulsed
me
rudely
enough
i
am
no
poor
weakling
said
she
if
that
is
your
only
reason
for
wanting
to
touch
presently
however
we
came
out
through
the
trees
and
the
roughest
part
of
our
journey
was
done
we
saw
the
ship
riding
to
her
anchors
in
shore
a
mile
away
and
a
weird
enough
object
she
was
under
the
faint
starlight
we
made
our
way
to
her
along
the
level
beaches
tob
was
keeping
a
keen
watch
we
were
challenged
the
moment
we
came
within
stone
or
arrow
shot
and
bidden
to
halt
and
recite
our
business
but
he
was
civil
enough
when
he
heard
we
were
those
whom
he
expected
he
called
a
crew
and
slacked
out
his
till
his
ship
ground
against
the
shingle
and
then
thrust
out
his
two
steering
oars
to
help
us
clamber
aboard
i
turned
to
ylga
with
words
of
thanks
and
farewell
i
will
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
this
night
and
should
the
high
gods
see
fit
to
bring
me
back
to
atlantis
and
power
you
shall
taste
my
i
do
not
want
to
return
i
am
sick
of
this
old
life
but
you
have
your
palace
in
the
city
and
your
servants
and
your
wealth
and
phorenice
will
not
disturb
you
from
their
oh
as
for
that
i
could
go
back
and
be
tomorrow
but
i
do
not
want
to
go
let
me
tell
you
it
is
no
time
for
a
gently
nurtured
lady
like
yourself
to
go
forward
i
have
been
viceroy
of
yucatan
ylga
and
know
somewhat
of
making
a
foothold
in
these
new
countries
and
that
was
nothing
compared
with
what
this
will
be
i
tell
you
it
entails
hardships
and
privations
and
sufferings
which
you
could
not
guess
at
few
survive
who
go
to
colonise
in
the
beginning
and
those
only
of
the
hardiest
and
they
earn
new
scars
and
new
batterings
every
i
do
not
care
and
besides
i
can
share
the
work
i
can
cook
i
can
shoot
a
good
arrow
and
i
can
make
garments
yes
though
they
were
cut
from
the
skins
of
beasts
and
had
to
be
sewn
with
backbone
sinews
because
you
despise
fine
clothes
and
because
you
have
seen
me
only
decked
out
as
you
think
i
am
useless
bah
deucalion
never
let
people
prate
to
me
about
your
perfection
you
know
less
about
a
woman
than
a
boy
new
from
i
have
learned
all
i
care
to
know
about
one
woman
and
because
of
the
memory
of
her
i
could
not
presume
to
ask
her
sister
to
come
with
me
aye
she
said
bitterly
kick
my
pride
i
knew
well
enough
it
was
only
second
place
to
nais
i
could
get
all
the
time
i
was
wanting
to
come
yet
no
one
but
a
boor
would
have
reminded
me
of
it
gods
and
to
think
that
half
the
men
in
atlantis
have
courted
me
and
now
i
am
arrived
at
this
i
must
go
alone
it
would
have
made
me
happier
to
take
your
esteem
with
me
but
as
it
is
i
suppose
i
shall
carry
only
your
that
is
the
most
humiliating
thing
of
all
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
hate
you
i
ought
to
i
know
after
the
brutal
way
you
have
scorned
me
but
i
do
not
and
there
is
the
truth
i
seem
to
grow
the
fonder
of
you
and
if
i
thought
there
was
a
way
of
keeping
you
alive
and
unmutilated
here
in
atlantis
i
do
not
think
i
should
point
out
that
tob
is
tired
of
waiting
and
will
probably
be
off
without
she
flung
her
arms
suddenly
about
my
neck
and
kissed
me
hotly
on
the
mouth
there
that
is
for
dear
you
see
i
am
reckless
i
care
not
what
i
do
now
knowing
that
you
can
not
despise
me
more
than
you
have
done
all
along
for
my
she
ran
back
from
me
into
the
edge
of
the
trees
but
this
is
foolishness
i
said
i
must
take
you
through
the
dangers
that
lie
between
here
and
some
gate
of
the
city
and
then
come
back
to
the
you
need
not
fear
for
me
the
unhappy
are
always
safe
and
besides
i
have
a
way
it
is
my
solace
to
know
that
you
will
remember
me
now
you
will
never
forget
that
fare
you
well
ylga
i
cried
may
the
high
gods
keep
you
entirely
in
their
holy
but
no
reply
came
back
she
had
gone
off
into
the
forest
and
so
i
turned
down
to
the
beach
and
splashed
into
the
water
and
climbed
on
board
the
ship
up
the
steering
oars
tob
gave
the
word
to
the
anchor
and
get
her
away
from
the
beach
greeting
my
lord
said
he
but
i
d
have
been
pleased
to
see
you
earlier
we
ve
small
enough
force
and
slow
enough
heels
in
this
vessel
and
it
s
my
idea
that
the
sooner
we
re
away
from
here
and
beyond
range
of
pursuit
the
safer
it
will
be
for
my
woman
and
brats
who
are
in
that
hutch
of
an
it
s
long
enough
since
i
sailed
in
such
a
small
ship
as
this
she
s
no
machines
and
she
s
not
even
a
steering
mannikin
look
at
the
meanness
of
her
furniture
and
in
your
ear
i
ve
suspicions
that
there
s
rottenness
in
her
bottom
but
she
s
the
best
i
d
the
means
to
buy
and
if
she
reaches
the
place
at
the
farther
end
i
ve
got
my
eye
on
we
shall
have
to
make
a
home
there
or
be
content
to
die
for
she
ll
never
have
strength
to
carry
us
farther
or
back
she
s
been
a
ship
in
the
egypt
trade
and
you
know
what
that
is
for
getting
worm
and
rot
in
the
you
d
enough
hands
for
your
scheme
before
i
came
oh
yes
i
ve
fifty
stout
lads
and
eight
women
packed
in
the
ship
somehow
and
trouble
enough
i
ve
had
to
get
them
away
from
the
city
that
thief
of
a
wellnigh
skinned
us
clean
before
he
could
see
it
lawful
that
so
many
useful
fighting
men
might
go
out
of
harbour
times
are
not
what
they
were
i
tell
you
and
the
sea
trade
s
about
done
all
sailor
men
of
any
skill
have
taken
a
woman
or
two
and
gone
out
in
companies
to
try
their
fortunes
in
other
lands
why
i
d
trouble
enough
to
get
half
a
score
to
help
me
work
this
ship
all
my
balance
are
just
landsmen
raw
and
simple
and
if
i
land
half
of
them
alive
at
the
other
end
we
shall
be
doing
still
with
luck
and
a
few
good
winds
it
should
not
take
long
to
get
across
to
tob
slapped
his
leg
no
savage
europe
for
me
my
lord
now
see
the
advantage
of
being
a
mariner
i
found
once
some
islands
to
the
north
of
europe
separated
from
the
main
by
a
strait
which
i
called
the
tin
islands
seeing
that
tin
ore
litters
many
of
the
beaches
i
was
driven
there
by
storm
and
said
no
word
of
the
find
when
i
got
back
and
here
you
see
it
comes
in
useful
there
s
no
one
in
all
atlantis
but
me
knows
of
those
tin
islands
and
we
ll
go
and
fight
honestly
for
our
ground
and
build
a
town
and
a
kingdom
on
with
tob
for
king
well
i
have
figured
it
out
as
such
for
many
a
day
but
i
know
when
i
meet
my
better
and
i
m
content
to
serve
under
deucalion
my
lord
would
have
done
wiser
to
have
brought
a
wife
with
him
though
and
i
thought
it
was
understood
by
the
good
lady
that
spoke
to
me
down
at
the
harbour
or
i
d
have
mentioned
it
earlier
the
savages
in
my
tin
islands
go
naked
and
stain
themselves
blue
with
woad
and
are
very
filthy
and
brutish
to
look
upon
they
are
sturdy
and
should
make
good
slaves
but
one
would
have
to
get
blunted
in
the
taste
before
one
could
wish
to
be
father
to
their
i
am
still
husband
to
tob
grinned
the
gods
give
you
joy
of
her
but
it
is
part
of
a
mariner
s
creed
and
you
will
grow
to
be
a
mariner
here
that
wedlock
does
not
hold
across
the
seas
however
that
matter
may
rest
but
coming
to
my
tin
islands
again
they
ll
delight
you
and
i
tell
you
a
kingdom
will
not
be
so
hard
to
carve
out
as
it
was
in
egypt
or
as
you
found
in
yucatan
there
are
beasts
there
of
course
and
no
one
who
can
hunt
need
ever
go
hungry
but
the
greater
beasts
are
few
there
are
and
in
small
numbers
to
be
sure
and
some
and
great
snakes
but
the
greater
lizards
seem
to
avoid
the
land
and
as
for
birds
there
is
rarely
seen
one
that
can
hurt
a
grown
man
oh
i
tell
you
it
will
be
a
most
desirable
tob
seems
to
have
imagined
himself
king
of
the
tin
islands
with
much
he
sighed
a
little
in
truth
i
did
and
there
is
no
denying
it
and
i
tell
you
plain
there
is
not
another
man
living
that
i
would
have
broken
this
voyage
for
but
deucalion
but
don
t
think
i
regret
it
and
don
t
think
i
want
to
push
myself
above
my
place
this
breeze
and
the
ebb
are
taking
the
old
ship
finely
along
her
ways
see
those
fire
baskets
on
the
harbour
forts
we
re
abreast
of
them
now
we
ll
have
dropped
them
and
the
city
out
of
sight
by
daylight
and
the
flood
will
not
begin
to
run
up
till
then
but
i
fear
unless
the
wind
hardens
down
with
the
dawn
we
ll
have
to
bring
up
to
an
anchor
when
the
flood
makes
tides
run
very
hard
in
these
narrow
seas
aye
and
there
are
some
shrewdish
round
my
tin
islands
as
you
shall
see
when
we
reach
there
were
many
fearful
glances
backwards
when
day
came
and
showed
the
waters
and
the
burning
mountains
that
hemmed
them
in
beyond
the
shores
all
seemed
to
expect
some
navy
of
phorenice
to
come
surging
up
to
take
them
back
to
servitude
and
starvation
in
the
squalid
wards
of
the
city
and
i
confess
ingenuously
that
i
was
with
them
in
all
truth
when
they
swore
they
would
fight
the
ship
till
she
sank
beneath
them
before
they
would
obey
another
of
the
commands
of
phorenice
however
their
brave
heroics
were
displayed
to
no
small
purpose
for
the
full
flow
of
the
tide
we
hung
in
our
place
barely
moving
past
the
land
but
yet
not
seeing
either
oar
or
sail
and
then
when
the
tide
turned
away
we
went
once
more
with
speed
mightily
comforted
tob
s
woman
must
needs
bring
drink
on
deck
and
bid
all
pour
libations
to
her
as
a
future
queen
but
tob
cuffed
her
back
into
the
slamming
to
the
hatch
behind
her
heels
and
bidding
the
crew
send
the
liquor
down
their
dusty
throats
we
are
done
with
that
foolery
said
he
my
lord
deucalion
will
be
king
of
this
new
kingdom
we
shall
build
in
the
tin
islands
and
a
right
proper
king
he
ll
make
as
you
untravelled
ones
would
know
if
you
d
sailed
the
outer
seas
with
him
as
i
have
beneath
which
i
read
a
regret
but
said
nothing
having
made
my
plans
from
the
moment
of
stepping
on
board
as
will
appear
on
a
later
sheet
so
on
down
the
great
estuary
we
made
our
way
and
though
it
pleasured
the
others
on
board
when
they
saw
that
the
seas
were
desolate
of
sails
it
saddened
me
when
i
recalled
how
once
the
waters
had
been
whitened
with
the
glut
of
shipping
they
had
started
off
on
their
voyage
with
a
bare
two
days
provision
in
their
equipment
and
so
of
necessity
even
after
leaving
the
great
estuary
we
were
forced
to
voyage
coastwise
putting
into
every
likely
river
and
sheltered
beach
to
slay
fish
and
meat
for
future
victualling
and
when
the
winter
comes
said
tob
as
its
gales
will
be
heavier
than
this
old
ship
can
stomach
i
had
determined
to
haul
up
and
make
a
permanent
camp
ashore
and
get
a
crop
of
grain
grown
and
threshed
before
setting
sail
again
it
is
the
usual
custom
in
these
voyages
and
i
shall
do
it
still
subject
to
my
lord
s
better
so
here
having
by
this
time
completed
a
two
months
leisurely
journey
from
the
city
i
saw
my
opportunity
to
speak
what
i
had
always
carried
in
my
mind
tob
i
said
i
am
a
poor
weak
defenceless
man
and
i
am
quite
at
your
mercy
but
what
if
i
do
not
voyage
all
the
way
to
the
tin
islands
and
oust
you
of
this
kingship
he
brightened
perceptibly
aye
he
grunted
you
are
very
weak
my
lord
and
mighty
defenceless
we
know
all
about
that
but
what
s
else
you
must
tell
all
your
meaning
plain
i
m
a
common
mariner
and
understand
little
of
your
fancy
why
this
that
it
is
not
my
wish
to
leave
the
continent
of
atlantis
if
you
will
put
me
down
on
any
part
of
this
side
that
faces
europe
i
will
commend
you
strongly
to
the
gods
i
would
i
could
give
you
money
or
better
still
articles
that
would
be
useful
to
you
in
your
colonising
but
as
it
is
you
see
me
as
to
that
you
owe
me
nothing
having
done
vastly
more
than
your
share
each
time
we
have
put
in
shore
for
the
hunting
but
it
will
not
do
this
plan
of
yours
i
will
shamedly
confess
that
the
sound
of
that
kingship
in
my
tin
islands
sounds
sweet
to
me
but
no
my
lord
it
will
not
do
you
are
no
mariner
yet
and
understand
little
of
geography
but
i
must
tell
you
that
the
part
of
atlantis
there
he
jerked
his
thumb
towards
the
line
of
trees
and
the
mountains
which
lay
beyond
the
fringe
of
surf
is
called
the
dangerous
lands
and
a
man
must
needs
be
a
salamander
and
be
learned
in
magic
so
i
am
told
before
he
can
live
i
laughed
we
of
the
priests
clan
have
some
education
tob
though
it
may
not
be
on
the
same
lines
as
your
own
in
fact
i
may
say
i
was
taught
in
the
colleges
concerning
the
boundaries
and
the
contents
of
our
continent
with
a
nicety
that
would
surprise
you
and
once
ashore
my
fate
will
still
be
under
the
control
of
the
most
high
he
muttered
something
in
his
profane
seaman
s
way
about
preferring
to
keep
his
own
fate
under
control
of
his
own
most
strong
right
arm
but
saying
that
he
would
keep
the
matter
in
his
thoughts
he
excused
himself
hurriedly
to
go
and
see
to
somewhat
concerning
the
working
of
the
ship
and
there
left
me
but
i
think
the
sweets
of
kingly
rule
were
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
letting
me
have
my
way
which
i
should
have
had
otherwise
if
it
had
not
been
given
peacefully
and
on
the
third
day
after
our
talk
he
put
the
ship
inshore
again
for
we
lurched
into
a
half
swamped
over
a
roaring
bar
and
ran
up
against
the
bank
and
made
fast
there
to
trees
but
booming
ourselves
a
safe
distance
off
with
oars
and
poles
so
that
no
beast
could
leap
on
board
out
of
the
thicket
and
were
set
about
with
promptitude
and
on
the
second
day
we
were
happy
enough
to
slay
a
yearling
which
gave
provisions
in
all
sufficiency
a
space
was
cleared
on
the
bank
fires
were
lit
and
the
meat
hung
over
the
smoke
in
strips
and
when
as
much
was
cured
as
the
ship
would
carry
the
shipmen
made
a
final
gorge
on
what
remained
filled
up
a
great
stack
of
hollow
reeds
with
drinking
water
and
were
ready
to
continue
the
voyage
with
sturdy
generosity
did
tob
again
attempt
to
make
me
sail
on
with
them
as
their
future
king
and
as
steadfastly
did
i
make
refusal
and
at
last
stood
alone
on
the
bank
amongst
the
gnawed
bones
of
their
feast
with
my
weapons
to
bear
me
company
and
he
and
his
men
and
the
women
stood
in
the
little
old
ship
ready
to
drop
down
river
with
the
current
at
least
said
tob
we
ll
carry
your
memory
with
us
and
make
it
big
in
the
tin
islands
for
forget
me
i
said
i
am
nothing
i
am
merely
an
incident
that
has
come
in
your
way
but
if
you
want
to
carry
some
memory
with
you
that
shall
endure
preserve
the
cult
of
the
most
high
gods
as
it
was
taught
to
you
when
you
were
children
here
in
atlantis
and
afterwards
when
your
colony
grows
in
power
and
has
come
to
sufficient
magnificence
you
may
send
to
the
old
country
for
a
we
want
no
priest
except
one
we
shall
make
ourselves
and
that
will
be
me
and
as
for
the
old
gods
well
i
have
laid
my
ideas
before
the
fellows
here
and
they
agree
to
this
we
are
done
with
those
old
gods
for
always
they
seem
worn
out
if
one
may
judge
from
their
present
lack
of
usefulness
in
atlantis
and
anyway
there
will
be
no
room
for
them
on
the
tin
let
go
those
warps
there
aft
and
shove
her
head
we
are
under
weigh
now
my
lord
and
beyond
recall
and
so
i
am
free
to
tell
you
what
we
have
decided
upon
for
our
religious
exercises
we
shall
set
up
the
memory
of
a
living
hero
on
earth
and
worship
that
and
when
in
years
to
come
the
picture
of
his
face
grows
dim
we
shall
doubtless
make
an
image
of
him
as
accurate
as
our
art
permits
and
build
him
a
temple
for
shelter
and
bring
there
our
offerings
and
prayers
and
as
i
say
my
lord
i
shall
be
priest
and
when
i
am
dead
the
sons
of
my
body
shall
be
priests
after
me
and
the
eldest
a
king
let
me
plead
with
you
i
said
this
must
not
the
ship
was
drifting
rapidly
away
with
the
current
and
they
were
hoisting
sail
tob
had
to
shout
to
make
himself
heard
aye
but
it
shall
be
for
i
too
am
a
strong
man
after
my
kind
and
i
have
ordered
it
so
and
if
you
want
the
name
of
our
hero
that
some
day
shall
be
god
you
wear
it
on
yourself
deucalion
shall
be
god
for
our
this
is
blasphemy
i
cried
have
a
care
fool
or
this
impiety
will
sink
we
will
risk
it
he
bawled
back
and
consider
the
odds
against
us
are
small
regard
here
is
thy
last
horn
of
wine
in
the
ship
and
my
woman
has
treasured
it
against
this
moment
regard
all
men
together
with
those
above
and
those
below
i
pour
this
wine
as
a
libation
to
deucalion
great
lord
that
is
hero
that
shall
be
god
that
will
be
in
time
to
come
and
then
all
those
on
the
ship
joined
in
the
acclaim
till
they
were
beyond
the
reach
of
my
voice
and
were
battling
their
way
out
to
sea
through
the
roaring
breakers
of
the
bar
solitary
i
stood
at
the
brink
of
the
forest
looking
after
them
and
musing
sadly
tob
despite
his
lowly
station
was
a
man
i
cared
for
more
than
many
like
all
seamen
i
knew
that
he
paid
his
devotions
to
one
of
the
obscurer
gods
but
till
then
i
had
supposed
him
devout
in
his
worship
his
new
avowal
came
to
me
as
a
desolating
shock
if
a
man
like
tob
could
forsake
all
the
older
gods
to
set
up
on
high
some
poor
mortal
who
had
momentarily
caught
his
fancy
what
could
be
expected
from
the
mere
thoughtless
mob
when
swayed
by
such
a
brilliant
tongue
as
phorenice
s
it
seemed
i
was
to
begin
my
exile
with
a
new
dreariness
added
to
all
the
other
adverse
prospects
of
atlantis
but
then
behind
me
i
heard
the
rustle
of
some
great
beast
that
had
scented
me
and
was
coming
to
attack
through
the
thicket
and
so
i
had
other
matters
to
think
upon
i
had
to
let
tob
and
his
ship
go
out
over
the
rim
of
the
horizon
unwatched
zaemon
s
summons
since
the
days
when
man
was
first
created
upon
the
earth
by
gods
who
looked
down
and
did
their
work
from
another
place
there
have
always
been
areas
of
the
land
for
his
maintenance
but
none
more
so
than
that
part
of
atlantis
which
lies
over
against
the
savage
continents
of
europe
and
africa
the
common
people
avoid
it
because
of
a
superstition
which
says
that
the
spirits
of
the
evil
dead
stalk
about
there
in
broad
daylight
and
slay
all
those
that
the
more
open
dangers
of
the
place
might
otherwise
spare
and
so
it
has
happened
often
that
the
criminals
who
might
have
fled
there
from
justice
have
returned
of
their
own
free
will
and
voluntarily
given
themselves
up
to
the
tormentors
rather
than
face
its
fabulous
terrors
to
the
educated
many
of
these
legends
are
known
to
be
mythical
but
withal
there
are
enough
disquietudes
remaining
to
make
life
very
arduous
and
stocked
with
peril
everywhere
the
mountains
keep
their
contents
on
the
boil
earth
tremors
are
every
day
s
experience
gushes
of
unseen
evil
vapours
steal
upon
one
with
such
cunningness
and
speed
that
it
is
often
hard
to
flee
in
time
before
one
is
choked
and
killed
poisons
well
up
into
the
rivers
yet
leave
their
colour
unchanged
great
cracks
split
across
the
ground
reaching
down
to
the
fires
beneath
and
the
waters
gush
into
these
and
are
shot
forth
again
with
devastating
explosion
and
always
may
be
expected
great
outpourings
of
boiling
mud
or
molten
rock
yet
with
all
this
there
are
great
sombre
forests
in
these
lands
with
trees
whose
age
is
unimaginable
and
fires
amongst
the
herbage
are
rare
all
beneath
the
trees
is
water
and
the
air
is
full
of
warm
steam
and
wetness
for
a
man
to
live
in
that
constant
hot
damp
is
very
mortifying
to
the
strength
but
strength
is
wanted
and
cunning
also
beyond
the
ordinary
for
these
dangerous
lands
are
the
abode
of
the
lizards
which
of
all
beasts
grow
to
the
most
enormous
size
and
are
the
most
fearsome
to
deal
with
there
are
countless
families
and
species
of
these
lizards
and
with
some
of
them
a
man
can
contend
with
prospect
of
success
but
there
are
others
whose
hugeness
no
human
force
can
battle
against
one
i
saw
as
it
came
up
out
of
a
lake
after
gaining
its
day
s
food
that
made
the
wet
land
shake
and
pulse
as
it
trod
it
could
have
taken
phorenice
s
mammoth
into
its
belly
and
even
a
mammoth
in
full
charge
could
not
have
harmed
it
great
horny
plates
covered
its
head
and
body
and
on
the
ridge
of
its
back
and
tail
and
limbs
were
spines
that
tore
great
slivers
from
the
black
trees
as
it
passed
amongst
them
translator
s
note
professor
reeder
of
the
wyoming
state
university
has
recently
unearthed
the
skeleton
of
a
brontosaurus
in
length
which
would
have
weighed
tons
when
alive
it
was
in
height
at
the
hips
and
at
the
shoulder
and
people
could
be
seated
with
comfort
within
its
ribs
its
thigh
bone
was
long
the
fossils
of
a
whole
series
of
these
colossal
lizards
have
been
found
now
and
again
these
monsters
would
get
caught
in
some
vast
fissuring
of
the
ground
but
not
often
their
speed
of
foot
was
great
and
their
sagacity
keen
they
seemed
to
know
when
the
worst
boilings
of
the
mountains
might
be
expected
and
then
they
found
safety
in
the
deeper
lakes
or
buried
themselves
in
wallows
of
the
mud
moreover
they
were
more
kindly
constituted
than
man
to
withstand
one
great
danger
of
these
regions
in
that
the
heat
of
the
water
did
them
no
harm
indeed
they
will
lie
peacefully
in
pools
where
sudden
are
making
the
water
leap
into
boiling
fountains
and
i
have
seen
one
run
quickly
across
a
flow
of
molten
rock
which
threatened
to
cut
it
off
and
not
be
so
much
as
singed
in
the
transit
in
the
midst
of
such
neighbours
then
was
my
new
life
thrown
and
existence
became
perilous
and
hard
to
me
from
the
outset
i
came
near
to
knowing
what
fear
was
and
indeed
only
a
fervent
trust
in
the
most
high
gods
and
a
firm
belief
that
my
life
was
always
under
their
fostering
care
prevented
me
from
gaining
that
horrid
knowledge
for
long
enough
till
i
learned
somewhat
of
the
ways
of
this
steaming
sweltering
land
i
was
in
as
miserable
a
case
as
even
phorenice
could
have
wished
to
see
me
my
clothes
rotted
from
my
back
with
the
constant
wetness
till
i
went
as
naked
as
a
savage
from
europe
my
limbs
were
racked
with
agues
and
i
could
find
no
herbs
to
make
drugs
for
their
relief
for
days
together
i
could
find
no
better
food
than
and
leaves
and
often
when
i
did
kill
beasts
knowing
little
of
their
qualities
i
ate
those
that
gave
me
pain
and
sickness
but
as
man
is
born
to
make
himself
adaptable
to
his
surroundings
so
as
the
months
dragged
on
did
i
learn
the
limitation
of
this
new
life
of
mine
and
gather
some
knowledge
of
its
resources
as
example
i
found
a
great
black
tree
with
a
hollow
core
and
a
hole
into
its
middle
near
the
roots
here
i
harboured
till
one
night
some
monstrous
lizard
whose
sheer
weight
made
the
tree
rock
like
a
sapling
endeavoured
to
suck
me
forth
as
a
bird
picks
a
worm
from
a
hollow
log
i
escaped
by
the
will
of
the
gods
i
could
as
much
have
done
harm
to
a
mountain
as
injure
that
horny
tongue
with
my
weapons
but
i
gave
myself
warning
that
this
chance
must
not
happen
again
so
i
cut
myself
a
ladder
of
footholes
on
the
inside
of
the
trunk
till
i
had
reached
a
point
ten
from
the
ground
and
there
cut
other
notches
and
with
tree
branches
made
a
floor
on
which
i
might
rest
later
for
luxury
i
carved
me
windows
in
the
walls
of
my
chamber
and
even
carried
up
sand
for
a
hearth
so
that
i
might
cook
my
victual
up
there
instead
of
lighting
a
fire
in
all
the
dangers
of
the
open
below
by
degrees
too
i
began
to
find
how
the
fish
of
the
rivers
and
the
lesser
turtles
might
be
more
readily
captured
and
so
my
ribs
threatened
less
to
start
through
their
proper
covering
of
skin
as
the
days
went
on
but
the
lack
of
salads
and
gruels
i
could
never
overcome
all
the
green
meat
was
tainted
so
powerfully
with
the
taste
of
tars
that
never
could
i
force
my
palate
to
accept
it
and
of
course
too
there
remained
the
peril
of
the
greater
lizards
and
the
other
dangers
native
to
the
place
but
as
the
months
began
to
mount
into
years
and
the
brute
part
of
my
nature
became
more
satisfied
there
came
other
longings
which
it
was
less
easy
to
provide
for
from
the
ivory
of
a
river
horse
s
tooth
i
had
endeavoured
to
carve
me
a
representative
of
nais
as
last
i
had
seen
her
but
though
my
fingers
might
be
loving
and
my
will
good
my
art
was
of
the
dullest
and
the
result
though
i
tried
time
and
time
again
was
always
clumsy
and
pitiful
still
in
my
eyes
it
carried
some
suggestion
of
the
original
a
curve
here
an
outline
there
and
it
made
my
old
love
glow
anew
within
me
as
i
sat
and
ate
it
with
my
eyes
yet
it
did
little
to
satisfy
my
longings
for
the
woman
i
had
lost
rather
it
whetted
my
cravings
to
be
with
her
again
or
at
least
to
have
some
knowledge
of
her
fate
other
men
of
the
priests
clan
have
come
out
and
made
an
abode
in
these
dangerous
lands
and
by
mortifying
the
flesh
have
gained
an
intimacy
with
the
higher
mysteries
which
has
carried
them
far
past
what
mere
human
learning
and
repetition
could
teach
indeed
here
and
there
one
who
from
some
cause
and
another
has
returned
to
the
abodes
of
men
has
carried
with
him
a
knowledge
that
has
brought
him
the
reputation
amongst
the
vulgar
for
the
workings
of
magic
and
miracles
which
since
all
arts
must
be
allowed
which
aid
so
holy
a
cause
have
added
very
materially
to
the
ardour
with
which
these
common
people
pursue
the
cult
of
the
gods
but
for
myself
i
could
not
free
my
mind
to
the
necessary
clearness
for
following
these
abstruse
studies
during
that
voyage
home
from
yucatan
i
had
communed
with
them
with
growing
insight
but
now
my
mind
was
not
my
own
nais
had
a
lien
upon
it
and
refused
to
be
ousted
and
in
truth
her
sweet
trespass
was
my
chief
solace
but
at
last
my
longing
could
no
further
be
denied
through
one
of
the
windows
of
my
i
could
see
far
away
a
great
mountain
top
whitened
with
perpetual
snow
which
our
lord
the
sun
dyed
with
blood
every
night
of
his
setting
night
after
night
i
used
to
watch
that
ruddy
light
with
wide
straining
eyes
night
after
night
i
used
to
remember
that
in
days
agone
when
i
was
entering
upon
the
priesthood
it
had
been
my
duty
to
adore
our
great
lord
as
he
rose
for
his
day
behind
the
snows
of
that
very
mountain
and
always
the
thought
followed
on
these
musings
that
from
that
distant
crest
i
could
see
across
the
continent
to
the
sacred
mount
which
had
the
city
below
it
where
i
had
buried
my
love
alive
so
at
last
i
gave
way
and
set
out
and
a
perilous
journey
i
made
of
it
in
the
heavy
mists
which
hung
always
on
the
lower
ground
my
way
lay
blind
before
me
and
i
was
constantly
losing
it
indeed
to
say
that
i
traversed
three
times
the
direct
distance
is
setting
a
low
estimate
throughout
all
those
swamps
the
great
lizards
hunted
and
as
the
country
was
new
to
me
i
did
not
know
places
of
harbour
and
a
hundred
times
was
within
an
ace
of
being
spied
and
devoured
at
a
mouthful
but
the
high
gods
still
desired
me
for
their
own
purposes
and
blinded
the
great
beasts
eyes
when
i
slunk
to
cover
as
they
passed
twice
rivers
of
scalding
water
roared
boiling
across
my
path
and
i
had
to
delay
till
i
could
collect
enough
black
timber
from
the
forests
to
build
rafts
that
would
give
me
dry
ferriage
it
will
be
seen
then
that
my
journey
was
in
a
way
infinitely
tedious
but
to
me
after
all
those
years
of
waiting
the
time
passed
on
winged
feet
i
had
been
separated
from
my
love
till
i
could
bear
the
strain
no
longer
let
me
but
see
from
a
distance
the
place
where
she
lay
and
feast
my
eyes
upon
it
for
a
while
and
then
i
could
go
back
to
my
abode
in
the
tree
and
there
remain
patiently
awaiting
the
will
of
the
gods
the
air
grew
more
chilly
as
i
began
to
come
out
above
the
region
of
trees
on
to
that
higher
ground
which
glares
down
on
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
made
buskins
and
a
coat
of
woven
grasses
to
protect
my
body
from
the
cold
which
began
to
blow
upon
me
keenly
and
later
on
where
the
snow
lay
eternally
and
was
blown
into
gullies
and
frozen
into
solid
banks
and
bergs
of
ice
i
had
hard
work
to
make
any
progress
amongst
its
perilous
mazes
and
was
moreover
so
numbed
by
the
chill
that
my
natural
strength
was
vastly
weakened
overhead
too
following
me
up
with
forbidding
swoops
and
occasionally
coming
so
close
that
i
had
to
threaten
it
with
my
weapons
was
one
of
those
huge
birds
which
live
by
pulling
down
and
carrying
off
any
creature
that
their
instincts
tell
them
is
weakly
and
likely
soon
to
die
but
the
lure
ahead
of
me
was
strong
enough
to
make
these
difficulties
seem
small
and
though
the
air
of
the
mountain
agreed
with
me
ill
causing
sickness
and
panting
i
pressed
on
with
what
speed
i
could
muster
towards
the
elusive
summit
time
after
time
i
thought
the
next
spurt
would
surely
bring
me
out
to
the
view
for
which
my
soul
yearned
but
always
there
seemed
another
bank
of
snow
and
ice
yet
to
be
climbed
but
at
last
i
reached
the
crest
and
gave
thanks
to
the
most
high
gods
for
their
protection
and
favour
far
far
away
i
could
see
the
sacred
mountain
with
its
ring
of
fires
burning
pale
under
the
day
and
although
the
splendid
city
which
nestled
at
its
foot
could
not
be
seen
from
where
i
stood
i
knew
its
position
and
i
knew
its
plan
and
my
soul
went
out
to
that
throne
of
granite
in
the
square
before
the
royal
pyramid
where
once
years
before
i
had
buried
my
love
had
phorenice
left
the
tomb
unviolated
i
stood
there
leaning
on
my
spear
filling
my
eye
with
the
prospect
warming
even
to
the
smoke
of
mountains
that
i
recognised
as
old
acquaintances
gods
how
my
love
burned
within
me
for
this
woman
my
whole
being
seemed
gone
out
to
meet
her
and
to
leave
room
for
nothing
beside
for
long
enough
a
voice
seemed
dimly
to
be
calling
me
but
i
gave
it
no
regard
i
had
come
out
to
that
hoary
mountain
top
for
communion
with
nais
alone
and
i
wanted
none
others
to
interrupt
but
at
length
the
voice
calling
my
name
grew
too
loud
to
be
neglected
and
i
pulled
myself
out
of
my
sweet
musing
with
a
start
to
think
that
here
for
the
first
time
since
parting
with
tob
and
his
company
i
should
see
another
human
i
gripped
my
weapon
and
asked
who
called
the
reply
came
clearly
from
up
the
slopes
of
mountain
and
i
saw
a
man
coming
towards
me
over
the
snows
he
was
old
and
feeble
his
body
was
bent
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
white
as
the
ground
on
which
he
trod
and
presently
i
recognised
him
as
zaemon
he
was
coming
towards
me
with
incredible
speed
for
a
man
of
his
years
and
feebleness
but
he
carried
in
his
hand
the
glowing
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
and
holy
strength
from
this
would
add
largely
to
his
powers
he
came
close
to
me
and
made
the
sign
of
the
seven
which
i
returned
to
him
with
its
completion
with
due
form
and
ceremony
and
then
he
saluted
me
in
the
manner
prescribed
as
messenger
appointed
by
the
high
council
of
the
priests
seated
before
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
and
i
made
humble
obeisance
before
him
in
all
things
i
will
obey
the
orders
that
you
put
before
me
i
said
such
is
your
duty
my
brother
the
command
is
that
you
return
immediately
to
the
sacred
mountain
so
that
if
human
means
may
still
prevail
you
as
the
most
skilful
general
atlantis
owns
within
her
borders
may
still
save
the
country
from
final
wreck
and
punishment
the
woman
phorenice
persists
in
her
infamies
the
poor
land
groans
under
her
heel
and
now
she
has
laid
siege
to
our
sacred
mountain
itself
and
swears
that
not
one
soul
shall
be
left
alive
in
all
atlantis
who
does
not
bend
humbly
to
her
it
is
a
command
and
i
obey
it
but
let
me
ask
of
another
matter
that
is
intimate
to
both
of
us
what
of
nais
nais
rests
where
you
left
her
untouched
phorenice
knows
by
her
arts
she
has
stolen
nearly
all
the
ancient
knowledge
now
that
still
you
live
and
she
keeps
nais
unharmed
beneath
the
granite
throne
in
the
hopes
that
some
time
she
may
use
her
as
a
weapon
against
you
little
she
knows
the
sternness
of
our
priests
creed
my
brother
why
even
i
that
am
the
girl
s
father
would
sacrifice
her
blithely
if
her
death
or
ruin
might
do
a
tittle
of
good
to
you
go
beyond
me
with
your
the
old
man
leaned
forward
at
me
with
glowering
brow
what
or
my
old
blind
adherence
to
the
ancient
dogma
has
been
sapped
and
weakened
by
events
you
must
buy
my
full
obedience
zaemon
if
you
want
it
promise
me
nais
and
your
arts
i
know
can
snatch
her
and
i
will
be
true
servant
to
the
high
council
of
the
priest
and
will
die
in
the
last
ditch
if
need
be
for
the
carrying
out
of
order
but
let
me
see
nais
given
over
to
the
fury
of
that
wanton
woman
and
i
shall
have
no
inwards
left
except
to
take
my
vengeance
and
to
see
atlantis
piled
up
in
ruins
as
her
zaemon
looked
at
me
bitterly
and
you
are
the
man
the
high
council
thought
to
trust
as
they
would
trust
one
of
themselves
truly
we
are
in
an
age
of
weak
men
and
faithless
now
but
my
lord
nay
i
must
call
you
brother
still
we
can
not
be
too
nice
in
our
choosing
you
are
the
best
there
is
and
we
must
have
you
we
little
thought
you
would
ask
a
price
for
your
generalship
having
once
taken
oath
on
the
walls
of
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
itself
that
always
come
what
might
you
would
be
a
servant
of
the
high
council
of
the
clan
without
fee
and
without
hope
of
advancement
but
this
is
the
age
of
broken
vows
and
you
are
going
no
more
than
trim
with
the
fashion
indeed
brother
perhaps
i
should
thank
you
for
being
no
more
greedy
in
your
you
may
spare
me
your
taunts
you
by
and
profound
search
into
the
highest
of
the
higher
mysteries
have
made
yourself
something
wiser
than
human
i
have
preserved
my
humanity
and
with
it
its
powers
and
frailties
and
it
seems
that
each
of
us
has
his
proper
uses
or
you
would
not
be
come
now
here
to
me
rather
you
would
have
done
the
generalling
you
make
a
warm
defence
my
brother
but
i
have
no
leisure
now
to
stand
before
you
with
argument
come
to
the
sacred
mountain
fight
me
this
wanton
upstart
empress
and
by
my
beard
you
shall
have
your
nais
as
you
left
her
as
a
it
is
a
command
of
the
high
council
which
shall
be
obeyed
i
will
come
with
my
brother
now
as
soon
as
he
is
nay
said
the
old
man
i
have
no
tiredness
and
as
for
coming
with
me
there
you
will
not
be
able
but
follow
at
what
pace
you
he
turned
and
set
off
down
the
snowy
slopes
of
the
mountain
and
i
followed
but
gradually
he
distanced
me
and
so
he
kept
on
with
speed
always
increasing
till
presently
he
passed
out
of
my
sight
round
the
spur
of
an
and
i
found
myself
alone
on
the
mountain
side
yes
truly
alone
for
his
footmarks
in
the
snow
from
being
deep
grew
shallower
and
less
noticeable
so
that
i
had
to
stoop
to
see
them
and
presently
they
vanished
entirely
and
the
great
mountain
s
flank
lay
before
me
trackless
and
untrodden
by
the
foot
of
man
since
time
began
i
was
not
shaken
by
any
great
amazement
though
it
was
beyond
my
poor
art
to
compass
this
thing
myself
having
occupied
my
mind
in
exile
more
with
memories
of
nais
than
in
study
of
those
uppermost
recesses
of
the
higher
mysteries
in
which
zaemon
was
so
prodigiously
wise
still
i
had
some
inkling
of
his
powers
zaemon
i
knew
would
be
back
again
in
his
dwelling
on
the
sacred
mountain
shaken
and
breathless
even
before
i
had
found
an
end
to
his
tracks
in
the
snow
and
it
behoved
me
to
join
him
there
in
the
quickest
possible
time
i
had
his
promise
now
for
my
reward
and
i
knew
that
he
would
carry
it
into
effect
beforetime
i
had
made
an
error
i
had
valued
atlantis
most
and
nais
my
private
love
as
only
second
but
now
it
was
in
my
mind
to
be
honest
with
others
even
as
with
myself
though
all
the
world
were
hanging
on
my
choice
i
could
but
love
my
nais
most
and
serve
her
first
and
foremost
of
all
siege
of
the
sacred
mountain
now
my
passage
across
the
great
continent
of
atlantis
if
tedious
and
haunted
by
many
dangers
need
not
be
recounted
in
detail
here
only
one
halt
did
i
make
of
any
duration
and
that
was
unavoidable
i
had
killed
a
stag
one
day
bringing
it
down
after
a
long
chase
in
an
open
savannah
i
scented
the
air
carefully
to
see
if
there
was
any
other
beast
which
could
do
me
harm
within
reach
and
thinking
that
the
place
was
safe
set
about
cutting
my
meat
and
making
a
sufficiency
into
a
bundle
for
carriage
but
underfoot
amongst
the
grasses
there
was
a
great
legged
worm
a
monstrous
green
thing
very
venomous
in
its
bite
and
presently
as
i
moved
i
brushed
it
with
my
heel
and
like
the
dart
of
light
it
swooped
with
its
tiny
head
and
struck
me
with
its
fangs
in
the
lower
thigh
with
my
knife
i
cut
through
its
neck
and
it
fell
to
writhing
and
struggling
and
twining
its
hundred
legs
into
all
manner
of
contortions
and
then
cleaning
my
blade
in
the
ground
i
stabbed
with
it
deep
all
round
the
wound
so
that
the
blood
might
flow
freely
and
wash
the
venom
from
its
lodgement
and
then
with
the
blood
trickling
healthily
down
from
my
heel
i
shouldered
the
meat
and
strode
off
thankful
for
being
so
well
quit
of
what
might
have
made
itself
a
very
ugly
adventure
as
i
walked
however
my
leg
began
to
be
filled
with
a
tightness
and
throbbing
which
increased
every
hour
and
presently
it
began
to
swell
also
till
the
skin
was
stretched
like
drawn
parchment
i
was
taken
too
with
a
sickness
that
racked
me
violently
and
if
one
of
the
greater
and
more
dangerous
beasts
had
come
upon
me
then
he
would
have
eaten
me
without
a
fight
with
the
fall
of
darkness
i
managed
to
haul
myself
up
into
a
tree
and
there
abode
in
the
crutch
of
a
limb
in
wakefulness
and
pain
throughout
the
night
with
the
dawn
when
the
night
beasts
had
gone
to
their
lairs
i
clambered
down
again
and
leaning
heavily
on
my
spear
limped
onwards
through
the
sombre
forests
along
my
way
the
moss
which
grows
on
the
northern
side
of
each
tree
was
my
guide
but
gradually
i
began
to
note
that
i
was
seeing
moss
all
round
the
trees
and
in
fact
was
growing
with
the
pain
and
the
swelling
of
the
limb
but
still
i
pressed
onwards
with
my
journey
my
last
instinct
being
to
obey
the
command
of
the
high
council
and
so
procure
the
enlargement
of
nais
as
had
been
promised
my
last
memory
was
of
being
met
by
someone
in
the
black
forest
who
aided
me
and
there
my
waking
senses
took
wings
into
forgetfulness
but
after
an
interval
wit
returned
and
i
found
myself
on
a
bed
of
leaves
in
a
cleft
between
two
rocks
which
was
furnished
with
some
poor
skill
and
fortified
with
stakes
and
buildings
against
the
entrance
of
the
larger
marauding
beasts
my
wound
was
dressed
with
a
poultice
of
herbs
and
at
the
other
side
of
the
cavern
there
squatted
a
woman
cooking
a
mess
of
and
honey
over
a
fire
of
sticks
how
came
i
here
i
asked
i
brought
you
said
she
and
who
are
you
a
nymph
they
call
me
and
i
practise
as
such
collecting
herbs
and
curing
the
diseases
of
those
that
come
to
me
telling
fortunes
and
making
predictions
in
return
i
receive
what
each
can
afford
and
if
they
do
not
pay
according
to
their
means
i
clap
on
a
curse
to
make
them
wither
it
s
a
lean
enough
living
when
wars
and
the
pestilence
have
left
so
few
poor
folk
to
live
in
the
do
you
visit
atlantis
not
phorenice
would
have
me
boiled
in
brine
living
if
she
could
lay
easy
hands
on
me
our
dainty
empress
tolerates
no
magic
but
her
own
they
say
she
is
for
pulling
down
the
priests
off
their
mountain
so
you
do
get
news
of
the
city
assuredly
it
is
my
trade
to
get
good
news
or
otherwise
how
could
i
tell
fortunes
to
the
vulgar
you
see
my
lord
i
detected
your
quality
by
your
speech
and
knowing
you
are
not
one
of
those
that
come
to
me
for
spells
and
potions
i
have
no
fear
in
speaking
to
you
tell
me
then
phorenice
still
reigns
most
as
a
maiden
as
the
mother
of
twin
sons
tatho
s
her
husband
now
and
has
been
these
three
tatho
who
followed
him
as
viceroy
of
yucatan
there
is
no
yucatan
a
vast
nation
of
little
hairy
men
so
the
tale
goes
coming
from
the
west
overran
the
country
they
had
clubs
of
wood
tipped
with
stone
as
their
only
arm
but
numbers
made
their
chief
weapon
they
had
no
desire
for
plunder
or
the
taking
of
slaves
or
the
conquering
of
cities
to
eat
the
flesh
of
atlanteans
was
their
only
lust
and
they
followed
it
prodigiously
their
numbers
were
like
the
bees
in
a
swarm
they
came
to
each
of
the
cities
of
yucatan
in
turn
and
though
the
colonists
slew
them
in
thousands
the
weight
of
numbers
always
prevailed
they
ate
clean
each
city
they
took
and
left
it
to
the
beasts
of
the
forest
and
went
on
to
the
next
and
so
in
time
they
reached
the
coast
towns
and
tatho
and
the
few
that
survived
took
ship
and
sailed
home
they
even
ate
tatho
s
wife
for
him
they
must
be
curious
persevering
things
these
little
hairy
men
the
gods
send
they
do
not
get
across
the
seas
to
atlantis
or
they
would
be
worse
plague
to
the
poor
country
than
now
i
had
heard
of
these
little
hairy
creatures
before
and
though
indeed
i
had
never
seen
them
i
had
gathered
that
they
were
a
little
less
than
human
and
a
little
more
than
bestial
a
link
so
to
speak
between
the
two
orders
and
specially
held
in
check
by
the
gods
in
certain
forest
solitudes
also
i
had
learned
that
on
occasion
when
punishment
was
needful
they
could
be
set
loose
as
a
devastating
army
upon
men
devouring
all
before
them
but
i
said
nothing
of
this
to
the
nymph
she
being
but
a
vulgar
woman
and
indeed
half
silly
as
is
always
the
case
with
these
sorceresses
who
gull
the
ignorant
common
folk
but
within
myself
i
was
bitterly
grieved
at
the
fate
of
that
fine
colony
of
yucatan
in
which
i
had
expended
such
an
infinity
of
pains
to
do
my
share
of
the
building
but
it
did
not
suit
my
purpose
to
have
my
name
and
quality
blazoned
abroad
till
the
time
was
full
and
so
i
said
nothing
to
the
nymph
about
yucatan
but
let
the
talk
continue
upon
other
matters
what
about
egypt
i
asked
in
its
accustomed
darkness
so
they
say
who
cares
for
egypt
these
latter
years
who
cares
for
anyone
or
anything
for
that
matter
except
for
himself
and
his
own
proper
estate
time
was
when
the
country
folk
and
the
hunters
hereabouts
brought
me
offerings
to
this
cave
for
sheer
piety
s
sake
but
now
they
never
come
near
unless
they
see
a
way
of
getting
good
value
in
return
for
their
gifts
and
by
result
instead
of
living
fat
and
hearty
i
make
lean
meals
off
honey
and
grubs
it
s
a
poor
life
a
nymph
s
in
these
latter
years
i
tell
you
my
lord
it
s
the
fashion
for
all
classes
to
believe
in
no
kind
of
mystery
what
manner
of
pestilence
is
this
you
spoke
of
i
have
not
seen
it
thank
the
gods
it
has
not
come
this
way
but
they
do
say
that
it
has
grown
from
the
folk
phorenice
has
slain
and
whose
bodies
remain
unburied
she
is
always
slaying
and
so
the
bodies
lie
thicker
than
the
birds
and
beasts
can
eat
them
for
which
of
our
sins
i
wonder
did
the
gods
let
phorenice
come
to
reign
i
wish
that
she
and
her
twins
were
boiled
alive
in
brine
before
they
came
between
an
honest
nymph
of
the
forest
and
her
living
they
say
she
has
put
an
image
of
herself
in
all
the
temples
of
the
city
now
and
has
ordered
prayers
and
sacrifices
to
be
made
night
and
morning
she
has
decreed
all
other
gods
inferior
to
herself
and
forbidden
their
worship
and
those
of
the
people
that
are
not
sufficiently
devout
for
her
taste
have
their
hamstrings
slit
by
their
tormentors
to
aid
them
constantly
into
a
devotional
will
you
eat
of
my
grubs
and
honey
there
is
nothing
else
your
back
was
bloody
with
carrying
meat
when
i
met
you
but
you
had
lost
your
load
you
must
either
taste
this
mess
of
mine
now
or
go
i
harboured
with
that
nymph
in
cave
six
days
she
using
her
drugs
and
charms
to
cure
my
leg
the
while
and
when
i
was
recovered
i
hunted
the
plains
and
killed
her
a
fat
horse
as
payment
and
then
went
along
my
ways
the
country
from
there
onwards
had
at
one
time
carried
a
sturdy
population
which
held
its
own
firmly
and
as
its
numbers
grew
took
in
more
ground
and
built
more
homesteads
farther
afield
the
houses
were
perched
in
trees
for
the
most
part
as
there
they
were
out
of
reach
of
and
and
the
other
more
dangerous
beasts
but
others
and
these
were
the
better
ones
were
built
on
the
ground
of
logs
so
ponderous
and
so
firmly
clamped
and
dovetailed
that
the
beasts
could
not
pull
them
down
and
once
inside
a
house
of
this
fashion
its
owners
were
safe
and
could
progue
at
any
attackers
through
the
interstices
between
the
logs
and
often
wound
sometimes
make
a
kill
but
not
one
in
ten
of
these
outlying
settlers
remained
the
houses
were
silent
when
i
reached
them
the
before
the
door
and
the
patch
of
vegetables
taken
back
by
the
greedy
fingers
of
the
forest
into
mere
scrub
and
jungle
and
farther
on
when
villages
began
to
appear
as
the
custom
is
to
ward
off
the
attacks
of
beasts
the
logs
which
aforetime
had
barred
the
gateway
lay
strewn
in
a
sprouting
undergrowth
and
naught
but
the
kitchen
middens
remained
to
prove
that
once
they
had
sheltered
human
tenants
phorenice
s
influence
seemed
to
have
spread
as
though
it
were
some
horrid
blight
over
the
whole
face
of
what
was
once
a
smiling
and
an
land
so
far
i
had
met
with
little
enough
interference
from
any
men
i
had
come
across
many
had
fled
with
their
women
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
at
the
bare
sight
of
me
some
stood
their
ground
with
a
threatening
face
but
made
no
offer
to
attack
seeing
that
i
did
not
offer
them
insult
first
and
a
few
a
very
few
offered
me
shelter
and
provision
but
as
i
neared
the
city
and
began
to
come
upon
muddy
beaten
paths
i
passed
through
governments
that
were
more
thickly
populated
and
here
appeared
strong
chance
of
delay
the
watcher
in
the
tower
which
is
set
above
each
village
would
spy
me
and
cry
here
is
a
masterless
man
and
then
the
people
that
were
within
would
rush
out
with
intent
to
spoil
me
of
my
weapons
and
afterwards
to
appoint
me
as
a
labourer
i
had
no
desire
to
slay
these
wretched
folk
being
filled
with
pity
at
the
state
to
which
they
had
fallen
and
often
words
served
me
to
make
them
stand
aside
from
the
path
and
stare
wonderingly
at
my
fierceness
and
let
me
go
my
ways
and
when
at
other
times
words
had
no
avail
i
strove
to
strike
as
lightly
as
could
be
my
object
being
to
get
forward
with
my
journey
and
leave
no
unnecessary
dead
behind
me
indeed
having
found
the
modern
way
of
these
villages
it
grew
to
be
my
custom
to
turn
off
into
the
forest
and
make
a
circuit
whenever
i
came
within
smell
of
their
garbage
similarly
too
when
i
got
farther
on
and
came
amongst
greater
towns
also
i
kept
beyond
challenge
of
their
walls
having
no
mind
to
risk
delay
from
the
whim
of
any
new
law
which
might
chance
to
be
set
up
by
their
governors
my
progress
might
be
slinking
but
my
pride
did
not
upbraid
me
very
loudly
indeed
the
fever
of
haste
burned
within
me
so
hot
and
i
had
little
enough
carrying
space
for
other
emotions
but
at
last
i
found
myself
within
a
s
journey
the
city
of
atlantis
itself
with
the
sacred
mountain
and
its
ring
of
fires
looming
high
beside
it
and
the
call
for
caution
became
trebly
accentuated
everywhere
evidences
showed
that
the
country
had
been
drained
of
its
fighting
men
everywhere
women
prayed
that
the
battles
might
end
with
the
rout
of
the
priests
or
the
killing
of
phorenice
so
that
the
wretched
land
might
have
peace
and
time
to
lick
its
wounds
an
army
was
investing
the
sacred
mountain
and
its
one
approach
was
most
narrowly
guarded
even
after
having
journeyed
so
far
it
seemed
as
if
i
should
have
to
sit
hopelessly
down
without
being
able
to
carry
out
the
orders
which
had
been
laid
upon
me
by
the
high
council
and
earn
the
reward
which
had
been
promised
force
would
be
useless
here
i
should
have
one
good
fight
a
gorgeous
fight
one
man
against
an
army
and
my
usefulness
would
be
ended
no
this
was
the
occasion
for
guile
and
i
found
covert
in
the
outskirts
of
a
wood
and
lay
there
cudgelling
my
brain
for
a
plan
across
the
plain
before
me
lay
the
grim
great
walls
of
the
city
with
the
heads
of
its
temples
and
its
palaces
and
its
pyramids
showing
beyond
the
of
the
royal
pyramid
held
my
eye
phorenice
had
expended
some
of
her
store
of
gold
in
overlaying
their
former
whiteness
with
sheets
of
shining
yellow
metal
but
it
was
not
that
change
that
moved
me
i
was
remembering
that
in
the
square
before
the
pyramid
there
stood
a
throne
of
granite
carved
with
the
snake
and
the
outstretched
hand
and
in
the
hollow
beneath
the
throne
was
nais
my
love
asleep
these
eight
years
now
because
of
the
drug
that
had
been
given
to
her
but
alive
still
and
waiting
for
me
if
only
i
on
my
part
could
make
a
way
to
the
place
where
zaemon
defied
the
empress
and
announce
my
coming
in
that
covert
of
the
woods
i
lay
a
day
and
a
night
raging
with
myself
for
not
discovering
some
plan
to
get
within
the
defences
of
the
sacred
mountain
but
in
the
morning
which
followed
there
came
a
man
towards
me
running
you
need
not
threaten
me
with
your
weapons
he
cried
i
mean
no
harm
it
seems
that
you
are
deucalion
though
i
should
not
have
known
you
myself
in
those
rags
and
skins
and
behind
that
tangle
of
hair
and
beard
you
will
give
me
your
good
word
i
know
believe
me
i
have
not
loitered
he
was
a
lower
priest
whom
i
knew
and
held
in
little
esteem
his
name
was
ro
a
greedy
fellow
and
not
overworthy
of
trust
from
whom
do
you
come
i
asked
zaemon
laid
a
command
on
me
he
came
to
my
house
though
how
he
got
there
i
can
not
tell
seeing
that
phorenice
s
army
blocks
all
possible
passage
to
and
from
the
mountain
i
told
him
i
wished
to
be
mixed
with
none
of
his
schemings
i
am
a
peaceful
man
deucalion
and
have
taken
a
wife
who
requires
nourishment
i
still
serve
in
the
same
temple
though
we
have
swept
out
the
old
gods
by
order
of
the
empress
and
put
her
image
in
their
place
the
people
are
tidily
pious
nowadays
those
that
are
left
of
them
and
the
living
is
consequently
easy
yes
i
tell
you
there
are
far
more
offerings
now
than
there
were
in
the
old
days
and
so
i
had
no
wish
to
be
mixed
with
matters
which
might
well
make
me
be
deprived
of
a
snug
post
and
my
head
to
i
can
believe
it
all
of
you
but
there
was
no
denying
zaemon
he
burst
into
one
of
his
black
furies
and
while
he
spoke
at
me
i
tell
you
i
felt
as
good
as
dead
you
know
his
powers
i
have
seen
some
of
well
the
gods
alone
know
which
are
the
true
gods
and
which
are
the
others
i
serve
the
one
that
gives
me
employment
but
those
that
zaemon
serves
give
him
power
and
that
s
beyond
denying
you
see
that
right
hand
of
mine
it
is
dead
and
paralysed
from
the
wrist
and
that
is
a
gift
of
zaemon
he
bestowed
it
he
said
to
make
me
collect
my
attention
then
he
said
more
hard
things
concerning
what
he
was
pleased
to
term
my
apostasy
not
letting
me
put
up
a
word
in
my
own
defence
of
how
the
change
was
forced
upon
me
and
finally
said
he
i
might
either
do
his
bidding
on
a
certain
matter
to
the
letter
or
take
that
punishment
which
my
falling
away
from
the
old
gods
had
earned
i
shall
not
kill
you
said
he
but
i
will
cover
all
your
limbs
with
a
paralysis
such
as
you
have
tasted
already
and
when
at
length
death
reaches
you
in
some
gutter
you
will
welcome
if
zaemon
said
those
words
he
meant
them
so
you
accepted
the
alternative
had
i
with
a
wife
depending
on
me
any
other
choice
i
asked
his
pleasure
it
was
to
find
you
when
you
came
in
here
from
some
distant
part
of
the
land
and
deliver
to
you
his
message
then
tell
me
where
is
the
meeting
place
said
i
and
there
is
none
appointed
nor
is
the
day
fixed
said
he
you
must
watch
and
search
always
for
him
but
when
he
comes
you
will
be
guided
to
his
well
deucalion
i
think
i
was
guided
but
how
i
do
not
know
but
now
i
have
found
you
and
if
there
s
such
a
thing
as
gratitude
i
ask
you
to
put
in
your
word
with
zaemon
that
this
deadness
be
taken
away
from
my
hand
it
s
an
awful
thing
for
a
man
to
be
forced
to
go
through
life
like
this
for
no
real
fault
of
his
own
and
zaemon
could
cure
it
from
where
he
sat
if
he
was
so
you
seem
still
to
have
a
very
full
faith
in
some
of
the
old
gods
priests
i
said
but
so
far
i
do
not
see
that
your
errand
is
done
i
have
had
no
message
why
the
message
is
so
simple
that
i
do
not
see
why
he
could
not
have
got
some
one
else
to
carry
it
you
are
to
make
a
great
blaze
you
may
fire
the
grasses
of
the
plain
in
front
of
this
wood
if
you
choose
and
on
the
night
which
follows
you
are
to
go
round
to
that
flank
of
the
sacred
mountain
away
from
the
city
where
the
rocks
run
down
sheer
and
there
they
will
lower
a
rope
and
haul
you
up
to
their
hands
it
seems
easy
and
i
thank
you
for
your
pains
i
will
ask
zaemon
that
your
hand
may
be
restored
to
you
shall
have
my
prayers
if
it
is
and
look
deucalion
it
is
a
small
matter
and
it
would
be
less
likely
to
slip
your
memory
if
you
saw
to
it
at
once
on
your
landing
later
you
may
be
disturbed
phorenice
is
bound
to
pull
you
down
off
your
perch
up
there
now
she
has
made
her
mind
to
it
she
never
fails
once
she
has
set
her
hand
to
a
thing
indeed
if
she
was
no
goddess
at
birth
she
is
making
herself
into
one
very
rapidly
she
has
got
all
the
ancient
learning
of
our
priests
and
more
besides
she
has
discovered
the
secret
of
life
these
recent
months
she
has
found
that
i
cried
fairly
startled
how
tell
me
how
only
the
three
know
that
it
is
beyond
our
knowledge
even
who
are
members
of
the
i
know
nothing
of
her
means
but
she
has
the
secret
and
now
she
is
as
good
an
immortal
so
she
says
as
any
of
them
well
deucalion
it
is
dangerous
for
me
to
be
missing
from
my
temple
overlong
so
i
will
go
you
will
carry
that
matter
we
spoke
of
in
your
mind
it
means
much
to
his
eye
wandered
over
my
ragged
person
and
if
you
think
my
service
is
of
value
to
you
you
see
me
poor
my
man
and
practically
some
small
coin
he
murmured
or
even
a
link
of
bronze
i
am
at
great
expense
just
now
buying
nourishment
for
my
wife
well
if
you
have
nothing
you
can
not
give
so
i
ll
just
bid
you
he
took
himself
off
then
and
i
was
not
sorry
i
had
never
liked
ro
but
i
wasted
no
more
precious
time
then
the
grass
blazed
up
for
a
signal
almost
before
his
timorous
heels
were
clear
of
it
and
that
night
when
the
darkness
gave
me
cover
i
took
the
risk
of
what
beasts
might
be
prowling
and
went
to
the
place
appointed
there
was
no
rope
dangling
but
presently
one
came
down
the
smooth
cliff
face
like
some
slender
snake
i
made
a
loop
slipped
it
over
a
leg
and
pulled
hard
as
a
signal
those
above
began
to
haul
and
so
i
went
back
to
the
sacred
mountain
after
an
absence
of
so
many
toilsome
and
warring
years
there
were
none
to
disturb
the
ascent
phorenice
s
troops
had
no
thought
to
guard
that
gaunt
bare
seamless
precipice
the
men
who
hauled
me
up
were
old
and
panted
heavily
with
their
task
and
until
i
knew
the
reason
i
wondered
why
a
knot
of
younger
priests
had
not
been
appointed
for
the
duty
but
i
put
no
question
with
us
of
the
priests
clan
on
the
sacred
mountain
it
is
always
taken
as
granted
that
when
an
order
is
given
it
is
given
for
the
best
besides
these
priests
did
not
offer
themselves
to
question
they
took
me
off
at
once
to
zaemon
and
that
is
what
i
could
have
wished
the
old
man
greeted
me
with
the
royal
sign
all
hail
to
deucalion
he
cried
king
of
atlantis
duly
called
thereto
by
the
high
council
of
the
is
phorenice
dead
i
asked
it
remains
for
you
to
slay
her
and
take
your
kingdom
if
indeed
when
all
is
done
there
remains
a
man
or
a
rood
of
land
to
govern
the
sentence
has
gone
out
that
she
is
to
die
and
it
shall
be
carried
into
effect
even
though
we
have
to
set
loose
the
most
dreadful
powers
that
are
stored
in
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
and
wreck
this
continent
in
our
effort
we
have
borne
with
her
infamies
all
these
years
by
command
sent
down
by
the
most
high
gods
but
now
she
has
gone
beyond
endurance
and
they
it
is
who
have
given
the
word
for
her
cutting
you
are
one
of
the
highest
three
i
am
only
one
of
the
seven
you
best
know
the
there
can
be
no
counting
the
cost
now
my
brother
and
my
king
it
is
an
it
is
an
order
i
repeated
formally
so
i
if
it
were
not
impious
to
do
so
it
would
be
easy
to
justify
this
decision
of
the
gods
the
woman
has
usurped
the
throne
yet
she
was
forgiven
and
bidden
rule
on
wisely
she
has
tampered
with
our
holy
religion
yet
she
was
forgiven
she
has
killed
the
peoples
of
atlantis
in
greedy
useless
wars
and
destroyed
the
country
s
trade
yet
she
was
forgiven
she
has
desecrated
the
old
temples
and
latterly
has
set
up
in
them
images
of
herself
to
be
worshipped
as
a
deity
yet
she
was
forgiven
but
at
last
her
evil
cleverness
has
discovered
to
her
the
tremendous
secret
of
life
and
death
and
there
she
overstepped
the
boundary
of
the
high
gods
forbearance
i
myself
went
to
carry
a
final
warning
and
once
more
faced
her
in
the
great
solemnly
i
recited
to
her
the
edict
and
she
chose
to
take
it
as
a
challenge
she
would
live
on
eternally
herself
and
she
would
share
her
knowledge
with
those
that
pleased
her
tatho
that
was
her
husband
should
also
be
immortal
indeed
if
she
thought
fit
she
would
cry
the
secret
aloud
so
that
even
the
common
people
might
know
it
and
death
from
mere
age
would
become
a
legend
she
cared
no
wit
how
she
might
upset
the
laws
of
nature
she
was
phorenice
and
was
the
highest
law
of
all
and
finally
she
defied
me
there
in
that
and
defied
also
the
high
gods
that
stood
behind
my
mouth
my
magic
is
as
strong
as
yours
you
pompous
fool
she
cried
and
presently
you
shall
see
the
two
stand
side
by
side
upon
their
she
began
to
collect
an
army
from
that
moment
and
we
on
our
part
made
our
preparations
it
was
discovered
by
our
arts
that
you
still
lived
and
king
of
atlantis
you
were
made
by
solemn
election
how
you
were
summoned
you
know
as
nearly
as
it
is
lawful
that
one
of
your
degree
should
know
how
you
came
you
understand
best
yourself
but
here
you
are
my
brother
and
being
king
now
you
must
order
all
things
as
you
see
best
for
the
preservation
of
your
high
estate
and
we
others
live
only
to
give
you
then
being
king
i
can
speak
without
seeming
to
make
use
of
a
threat
i
must
have
my
queen
first
or
i
am
not
strong
enough
to
give
my
whole
mind
to
this
she
shall
be
brought
so
then
i
will
be
a
general
now
and
see
to
the
defences
of
this
place
and
view
the
men
who
are
here
to
stand
behind
i
went
out
of
the
dwelling
then
zaemon
giving
place
and
following
me
it
was
night
still
but
there
is
no
darkness
on
the
upper
part
of
the
sacred
mountain
a
ring
of
fires
fed
eternally
from
the
which
wells
up
from
below
burns
round
of
the
crest
lighting
it
always
as
bright
as
day
and
in
fact
forming
no
small
part
of
its
fortification
indeed
it
is
said
that
in
the
early
dawn
of
history
men
first
came
to
the
mountain
as
a
stronghold
because
of
the
natural
defence
which
the
fires
offered
there
is
no
bridging
these
flames
or
smothering
them
on
either
side
of
their
line
for
a
hundred
paces
the
ground
glows
with
heat
and
a
man
would
be
turned
to
ash
who
tried
to
cross
it
round
full
the
mountain
slopes
the
fires
make
a
rampart
unbreakable
and
on
the
other
side
the
rock
runs
in
one
sheer
precipice
from
the
crest
to
the
plain
which
spreads
beyond
its
foot
but
it
is
on
this
farther
side
that
there
is
the
only
entrance
way
which
gives
passage
to
the
crest
of
the
sacred
mountain
from
below
running
diagonally
up
the
steep
face
of
the
cliff
is
a
gigantic
fissure
which
succeeding
ages
as
man
has
grown
more
luxurious
have
made
more
easy
to
climb
looking
at
the
additions
in
the
ancient
days
i
can
well
imagine
that
none
but
the
most
daring
could
have
made
the
ascent
but
one
generation
has
thrown
a
bridge
over
a
bad
gap
here
and
another
has
cut
into
the
living
stone
and
widened
a
ledge
there
till
in
these
latter
years
there
is
a
path
with
cut
steps
and
carved
balustrade
such
as
the
feeblest
or
most
giddy
might
traverse
with
little
effort
or
exertion
but
always
when
these
improvers
made
smooth
the
obstacles
they
were
careful
to
weaken
in
no
possible
way
the
natural
defences
but
rather
to
add
to
them
eight
gates
of
stone
there
were
cutting
the
pathway
each
commanding
a
straight
steep
piece
of
the
ascent
and
overhanging
each
gate
was
a
gallery
secure
from
yet
so
contrived
that
great
stones
could
be
hurled
through
holes
in
the
floor
of
it
in
such
a
manner
that
they
must
irretrievably
smash
to
a
pulp
any
men
advancing
against
it
from
below
and
in
caves
dug
out
from
the
rock
on
either
hand
was
a
great
hoard
of
these
stones
so
that
no
enemy
through
sheer
expenditure
of
troops
could
hope
to
storm
a
gate
by
exhausting
its
ammunition
but
though
there
were
eight
of
these
granite
gates
in
the
series
we
had
the
whole
number
to
depend
on
no
longer
the
lowest
gate
was
held
by
a
garrison
of
phorenice
s
troops
who
had
built
a
wall
above
them
to
protect
their
occupation
the
gate
had
been
gained
by
no
brilliant
feat
of
arms
it
had
been
won
by
threats
bribery
and
promises
or
in
other
words
it
had
been
given
up
by
the
blackest
treachery
and
here
lay
the
keynote
of
the
weakness
in
our
defence
the
most
perfect
ramparts
that
brain
can
invent
are
useless
without
men
to
line
them
and
it
was
men
we
lacked
of
students
entering
into
the
colleges
of
the
sacred
mountain
there
had
been
none
now
for
many
a
year
the
younger
generation
thought
little
of
the
older
gods
of
the
men
that
had
grown
up
amongst
the
sacred
groves
and
filled
offices
there
many
had
become
lukewarm
in
their
faith
and
remained
on
only
through
habit
and
because
an
easy
living
stayed
near
them
there
and
these
when
the
siege
began
quickly
made
their
way
over
to
the
other
side
phorenice
was
no
fool
to
fight
against
unnecessary
strength
her
heralds
made
proclamation
that
peace
and
a
good
subsistence
would
be
given
to
those
who
chose
to
come
out
to
her
willingly
and
as
an
alternative
she
would
kill
by
torture
and
mutilation
those
she
caught
in
the
place
when
she
took
it
by
storm
as
she
most
assuredly
would
do
before
she
had
finished
with
it
and
so
great
was
the
prestige
of
her
name
that
quite
of
these
that
remained
on
the
mountain
took
themselves
away
from
the
defence
there
was
no
attempt
to
hold
back
these
sorry
priests
nor
was
there
any
punishing
them
as
they
went
zaemon
indeed
was
minded
so
he
told
me
with
grim
meaning
himself
to
give
them
some
memento
of
their
apostasy
to
carry
away
which
would
not
wear
out
but
the
others
of
the
high
council
made
him
stay
his
vengeful
hand
and
so
when
i
came
to
the
place
the
garrison
numbered
no
more
than
eighty
counting
even
feeble
old
dotards
who
could
barely
walk
and
of
men
not
past
their
prime
i
could
barely
command
a
score
still
seeing
the
narrowness
of
the
passages
which
led
to
each
of
the
gates
up
which
in
no
place
could
more
than
two
men
advance
together
we
were
by
no
means
in
desperate
straits
for
the
defence
as
yet
and
if
my
kingdom
was
so
far
small
consisting
as
it
did
in
effect
of
the
sacred
mountain
and
no
other
part
of
atlantis
at
any
rate
there
seemed
little
danger
of
its
being
further
contracted
another
of
the
wise
precautions
of
the
men
of
old
stood
us
in
good
stead
then
in
the
ancient
times
when
grain
first
was
grown
as
food
it
came
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
acme
of
wealth
tribute
was
always
paid
from
the
people
to
their
priests
and
presently
so
the
old
histories
say
it
was
appointed
that
this
should
take
the
form
of
grain
as
this
was
a
medium
both
dignified
and
fitting
and
those
of
the
people
who
had
it
not
were
forced
to
barter
their
other
produce
for
grain
before
they
could
pay
this
tribute
on
the
sacred
mountain
itself
vast
storehouses
were
dug
in
the
rock
and
here
the
grain
was
teemed
in
great
yellow
heaps
and
each
generation
of
those
that
were
set
over
it
took
a
pride
in
adding
to
the
accumulation
in
more
modern
days
it
had
been
a
custom
amongst
the
younger
and
more
forward
of
the
priests
to
scoff
at
this
ancient
provision
and
to
hold
that
a
treasure
of
gold
or
weapons
or
jewels
would
have
more
value
and
no
less
of
dignity
and
more
than
once
it
has
been
a
close
thing
lest
these
innovators
should
not
be
but
as
it
was
the
old
constitution
had
happily
been
preserved
and
now
in
these
years
of
trial
the
clan
reaped
the
benefit
and
so
with
these
granaries
and
a
series
of
great
tanks
and
cisterns
which
held
the
rainfall
there
was
no
chance
of
phorenice
reducing
our
stronghold
by
mere
close
investment
even
though
she
sat
down
stubbornly
before
it
for
a
score
of
years
but
it
was
the
paucity
of
men
for
the
defence
which
oppressed
me
most
as
i
took
my
way
about
the
head
of
the
mountain
inspecting
all
points
the
emptiness
of
the
place
smote
me
like
a
succession
of
blows
the
groves
once
so
trim
were
now
shaggy
and
unpruned
wind
had
whirled
the
leaves
in
upon
the
temple
floors
and
they
lay
there
unswept
the
college
of
youths
held
no
more
now
than
a
musty
smell
to
bear
witness
that
men
had
once
been
grown
there
the
homely
palaces
of
the
higher
priests
at
one
time
so
ardently
sought
after
lay
many
of
them
empty
because
not
even
one
candidate
came
forward
now
to
canvass
for
election
evil
thoughts
surged
up
within
me
as
i
saw
these
things
that
were
direct
promptings
from
the
nether
gods
there
must
be
something
wanting
these
tempters
whispered
in
a
religion
from
which
so
many
of
its
priests
fled
at
the
first
pinch
of
i
did
what
i
could
to
thrust
these
waverings
resolutely
behind
me
but
they
refused
to
be
altogether
ousted
from
my
brain
and
so
i
made
a
compromise
with
myself
first
i
would
with
the
help
that
might
be
given
me
destroy
this
wanton
phorenice
and
regain
the
kingdom
which
had
been
given
me
to
my
own
proper
rule
and
afterwards
i
would
call
a
council
of
the
seven
and
council
of
the
three
and
consider
without
prejudice
if
there
was
any
matter
in
which
our
ancient
ritual
could
be
amended
to
suit
the
more
modern
requirements
but
this
should
not
be
done
till
phorenice
was
dead
and
i
was
firmly
planted
in
her
room
i
would
not
be
a
party
even
to
myself
to
any
plan
which
smacked
at
all
of
surrender
and
there
as
i
walked
through
the
desolate
groves
and
beside
the
cold
altars
the
high
gods
were
pleased
to
show
their
approval
of
my
scheme
and
to
give
me
opportunity
to
bind
myself
to
it
with
a
solemn
oath
and
vow
at
that
moment
from
his
distant
in
the
east
our
lord
the
sun
leaped
up
to
begin
another
day
for
long
enough
from
where
i
stood
below
the
crest
of
the
mountain
he
himself
would
be
invisible
but
the
great
light
of
his
glory
spread
far
into
the
sky
and
against
it
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
loomed
in
black
outline
from
the
highest
crag
where
it
rested
lonely
and
terrible
for
anyone
unauthorised
to
go
nearer
than
a
thousand
paces
to
this
storehouse
of
the
highest
mysteries
meant
instant
death
on
that
day
when
i
was
initiated
as
one
of
the
seven
i
had
been
permitted
to
go
near
and
once
press
my
lips
against
its
ample
curves
and
the
rank
of
my
degree
gave
me
the
privilege
to
repeat
that
salute
again
once
on
each
day
when
a
new
year
was
born
but
what
lay
inside
its
great
interior
and
how
it
was
entered
that
was
hidden
from
the
seven
even
as
it
was
from
the
other
priests
and
the
common
people
in
the
city
below
only
those
who
had
been
raised
to
the
sublime
elevation
of
the
three
had
a
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
powers
which
were
stored
within
it
i
went
down
on
my
knees
where
i
was
and
zaemon
knelt
beside
me
and
together
we
recited
the
prayers
which
had
been
said
by
the
priests
from
the
beginning
of
time
giving
thanks
to
our
great
lord
that
he
has
come
to
brighten
another
day
and
then
with
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
black
outline
of
the
ark
of
mysteries
i
vowed
that
come
what
might
i
at
least
would
be
true
servant
of
the
high
gods
to
my
life
s
end
and
that
my
whole
strength
should
be
spent
in
restoring
their
worship
and
glory
nais
the
regained
now
from
where
we
stood
together
just
below
the
crest
of
the
sacred
mountain
we
could
see
down
into
the
city
which
lay
spread
out
below
us
like
a
map
the
harbour
and
the
great
estuary
gleamed
at
its
farther
side
and
the
fringe
of
hills
beyond
smoked
and
fumed
in
their
accustomed
fashion
the
great
stone
circle
of
our
lord
the
sun
stood
up
grim
and
bare
in
the
middle
of
the
city
and
nearer
in
reared
up
the
great
mass
of
the
royal
pyramid
the
gold
on
its
sides
catching
new
gold
from
the
sun
there
too
in
the
square
before
the
pyramid
stood
the
throne
of
granite
dwarfed
by
the
distance
to
the
size
of
a
mole
s
hill
in
which
these
nine
years
my
love
had
lain
sleeping
old
zaemon
followed
my
gaze
ay
he
said
with
a
sigh
i
know
where
your
chief
interest
is
deucalion
when
he
landed
here
new
from
yucatan
was
a
strong
man
the
king
whom
we
have
chosen
and
who
is
the
best
we
have
to
choose
has
his
it
can
be
turned
into
additional
strength
give
me
nais
here
living
and
warm
to
fight
for
and
i
am
a
stronger
man
by
far
than
the
cold
viceroy
and
soldier
that
you
speak
i
have
passed
my
word
to
that
already
and
you
shall
have
her
but
at
the
cost
of
damaging
somewhat
this
new
kingdom
of
yours
maybe
too
at
the
same
time
we
may
rid
you
of
this
phorenice
and
her
brood
but
i
do
not
think
it
likely
she
is
too
wily
and
once
we
begin
our
play
she
is
likely
to
guess
whence
it
comes
and
how
it
will
end
and
so
will
make
an
escape
before
harm
can
reach
her
the
high
gods
who
have
sent
all
these
trials
for
our
refinement
have
seen
fit
to
give
her
some
knowledge
of
how
these
earth
tremors
may
be
set
i
have
seen
her
juggle
with
them
but
may
i
hear
your
scheme
it
will
be
shown
you
in
good
time
enough
but
for
the
present
i
would
bid
you
sleep
it
will
be
your
part
to
go
into
the
city
and
take
your
woman
that
is
my
daughter
when
she
is
set
free
and
bring
her
here
as
best
you
can
and
for
that
you
will
need
all
a
strong
man
s
he
stepped
back
and
looked
me
up
and
there
are
not
many
folk
that
would
take
you
for
the
tidy
deucalion
now
my
brother
your
appearance
will
be
a
fine
armour
for
you
down
yonder
in
the
city
when
we
wake
it
with
our
and
terror
as
you
stand
now
you
are
hairy
enough
and
shaggy
enough
and
naked
enough
and
dirty
enough
for
some
wild
savage
new
landed
out
of
europe
have
a
care
that
no
fine
citizen
down
yonder
takes
a
fancy
to
your
thews
and
seizes
upon
you
as
his
i
somewhat
pity
him
in
his
household
if
he
old
zaemon
laughed
why
come
to
think
of
it
so
do
but
quickly
he
got
grave
again
laughter
and
zaemon
were
very
rare
playmates
well
get
you
to
bed
my
king
and
leave
me
to
go
into
the
ark
of
mysteries
and
prepare
there
with
another
of
the
three
the
things
that
must
be
done
it
is
no
light
business
to
handle
the
tremendous
powers
which
we
must
put
into
movement
this
night
and
there
is
danger
for
us
as
there
is
for
you
so
if
by
chance
we
do
not
meet
again
till
we
stand
up
yonder
behind
the
stars
giving
account
to
the
gods
fare
you
well
i
slept
that
day
as
a
soldier
sleeps
taking
full
rest
out
of
the
hours
and
letting
no
harassing
thought
disturb
me
it
is
only
the
weak
who
permit
their
sleep
to
be
broken
on
these
occasions
and
when
the
dark
was
well
set
i
roused
and
fetched
those
who
should
attend
to
the
rope
our
lady
the
moon
did
not
shine
at
that
turn
of
the
month
and
the
air
was
full
of
a
great
blackness
so
i
was
out
of
sight
all
the
while
they
lowered
me
i
reached
the
tumbled
rocks
that
lay
at
the
deep
foot
of
the
cliff
and
then
commenced
to
use
a
nice
caution
because
phorenice
s
soldiers
squatted
uneasily
round
their
as
though
they
had
forebodings
of
the
coming
evil
i
had
no
mind
to
further
stir
their
wakefulness
so
i
crept
swiftly
along
in
the
darkest
of
the
shadows
and
at
last
came
to
the
spot
where
that
passage
ends
which
before
i
had
used
to
get
beneath
the
walls
of
the
city
the
lamp
was
in
place
and
i
made
my
way
along
the
windings
swiftly
the
air
so
it
seemed
to
me
was
even
more
noxious
with
vapours
than
it
had
been
when
i
was
down
there
before
and
i
judged
that
zaemon
had
already
begun
to
stir
those
internal
activities
which
were
shortly
to
convulse
the
city
but
again
i
had
difficulty
in
finding
an
exit
and
this
not
because
there
were
people
moving
about
at
the
places
where
i
had
to
come
out
but
because
the
set
of
the
masonry
was
entirely
changed
in
olden
times
the
priests
clan
oversaw
all
the
architects
plans
and
ruled
out
anything
likely
to
clash
with
their
secret
passages
and
chambers
but
in
this
modern
day
the
priests
were
of
small
account
and
had
no
say
in
this
matter
and
the
architects
often
through
sheer
blundering
sealed
up
and
made
useless
many
of
these
outlets
and
as
it
was
then
i
had
to
get
out
of
the
network
of
tunnels
and
galleries
where
i
could
and
not
where
i
would
and
in
the
event
found
myself
at
the
farther
side
of
the
city
almost
up
to
where
the
outer
wall
joins
down
to
the
harbour
i
came
out
without
being
seen
careful
even
in
this
moment
of
extremity
to
preserve
the
ordinances
and
closed
all
traces
of
exit
behind
me
the
earth
seemed
to
spring
beneath
my
feet
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
in
smooth
water
and
though
there
was
no
actual
movement
as
yet
to
disturb
the
people
and
indeed
these
slept
on
in
their
houses
and
shelters
without
alarm
i
could
feel
myself
that
the
solid
deadness
of
the
ground
was
gone
and
that
any
moment
it
might
break
out
into
devastating
waves
of
movement
gods
should
i
be
too
late
to
see
the
untombing
of
my
love
would
she
be
laid
there
bare
to
the
public
gaze
when
presently
the
people
swarmed
out
into
the
open
spaces
through
fear
at
what
the
great
earth
tremor
might
cause
to
fall
i
could
see
in
fancy
their
rude
cruel
hands
thrust
upon
her
as
she
lay
there
helpless
and
my
inwards
dried
up
at
the
thought
i
ran
madly
down
and
down
the
narrow
winding
streets
with
the
one
thought
of
coming
to
the
square
which
lay
in
front
of
the
royal
pyramid
before
these
things
came
to
pass
with
exquisite
cruelty
i
had
been
forced
with
my
own
hands
to
place
her
alive
in
her
beneath
the
granite
throne
and
if
thews
and
speed
could
do
it
i
would
not
miss
my
reward
of
taking
her
forth
again
with
the
same
strong
hands
few
disturbed
that
furious
hurry
at
first
here
and
there
some
wretch
who
harboured
in
the
gutter
cried
a
thief
throw
a
share
or
i
but
if
any
of
these
followed
i
do
not
know
at
any
rate
my
speed
then
must
have
anyone
presently
too
as
the
swing
of
the
earth
underfoot
became
more
keen
and
the
stonework
of
the
buildings
by
the
street
side
began
to
grate
and
groan
and
grit
and
sent
forth
little
showers
of
dust
people
began
to
run
with
scared
cries
from
out
of
their
doors
but
none
of
these
had
a
mind
to
stop
the
ragged
shaggy
savage
man
who
ran
so
swiftly
past
and
flung
the
mud
from
his
naked
feet
and
so
in
time
i
came
to
the
great
square
and
was
there
none
too
soon
the
place
was
filling
with
people
who
flocked
away
from
the
narrow
streets
and
it
was
full
of
darkness
and
noise
and
dust
and
sickness
beneath
us
the
ground
rippled
in
undulations
like
a
sea
which
with
terrifying
slowness
grew
more
and
more
intense
ever
and
again
a
house
crashed
down
unseen
in
the
gloom
and
added
to
the
tumult
but
the
great
pyramid
had
been
planned
by
its
old
builders
to
stand
rude
shocks
its
stones
were
dovetailed
into
one
another
with
a
marvellous
cleverness
and
were
further
clamped
and
joined
by
ponderous
tongues
of
metal
it
was
a
boast
that
the
foundations
could
be
dug
from
beneath
it
and
still
the
pyramid
would
stand
under
heaven
more
enduring
than
the
hills
flickering
torches
showed
that
its
great
stone
doors
lay
open
and
ever
and
again
i
saw
some
frightened
inmate
scurry
out
and
then
be
lost
to
sight
in
the
gloom
but
with
the
royal
pyramid
and
its
ultimate
fate
i
had
little
concern
i
did
not
even
care
then
whether
phorenice
was
trapped
or
whether
she
came
out
sound
and
fit
for
further
mischief
i
crouched
by
the
granite
throne
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
that
splendid
square
and
heard
its
stones
grate
together
like
the
ends
of
a
broken
bone
as
it
rocked
to
the
in
that
night
of
dust
and
darkness
it
was
hard
to
see
the
outline
of
one
s
own
hand
but
i
think
that
the
gods
in
some
requital
for
the
love
which
had
ached
so
long
within
me
gave
me
special
power
of
sight
as
i
watched
i
saw
the
great
carved
rock
which
formed
the
capstone
of
the
throne
move
slightly
and
then
move
again
and
then
again
a
tiny
jerk
for
each
but
still
there
was
an
appreciable
shifting
and
moreover
the
stone
moved
always
to
one
side
there
was
method
in
zaemon
s
desperate
work
and
this
in
my
blind
panic
of
love
and
haste
i
had
overlooked
so
i
went
up
the
steps
of
the
throne
on
the
side
from
which
the
great
capstone
was
moving
and
clung
there
afire
with
expectation
more
and
more
violent
did
the
grow
though
the
graduations
of
its
increase
could
not
be
perceived
and
the
din
of
falling
houses
and
the
shrieks
and
cries
of
hurt
and
frightened
people
went
louder
up
into
the
night
thicker
grew
the
dust
that
filled
the
air
till
one
coughed
and
strangled
in
the
breathing
and
more
black
did
the
night
become
as
the
dust
rose
and
blotted
the
rare
stars
from
sight
i
clung
to
an
angle
of
the
granite
throne
crouching
on
the
uppermost
step
but
one
below
the
capstone
and
could
scarcely
keep
my
place
against
the
violence
of
the
earth
tremors
but
still
the
huge
capstone
that
was
carved
with
the
snake
and
the
outstretched
hand
held
my
love
fast
locked
in
her
living
tomb
and
i
could
have
bit
the
cold
granite
at
the
impotence
which
barred
me
from
her
the
people
who
kept
thronging
into
the
square
were
mad
with
terror
but
their
very
numbers
made
my
case
more
desperate
every
moment
phorenice
goddess
aid
us
now
some
cried
and
when
the
prayer
did
not
bring
them
instant
relief
they
fell
to
yammering
out
the
old
confessions
of
the
faith
which
they
had
learned
in
childhood
turning
in
this
hour
of
their
dreadful
need
to
those
old
gods
which
through
so
many
dishonourable
years
they
had
spurned
and
deserted
it
was
a
curious
criticism
on
the
balance
of
their
real
religion
if
one
had
cared
to
make
it
louder
grew
the
crash
of
falling
masonry
and
from
the
royal
pyramid
itself
though
indeed
i
could
not
even
see
its
outline
through
the
darkness
there
came
sounds
of
grinding
stones
and
cracking
bars
of
metal
which
told
that
even
its
superb
majestic
strength
had
a
breaking
strain
there
came
to
my
mind
the
threat
that
old
zaemon
had
thundered
forth
in
that
painted
perfumed
you
shall
see
he
had
cried
to
the
empress
this
royal
pyramid
which
you
have
polluted
with
your
debaucheries
torn
tier
from
tier
and
stone
from
stone
and
scattered
as
feathers
spread
before
a
wind
still
heavier
grew
the
surging
of
the
earth
and
the
pavement
of
the
great
square
gaped
and
upheaved
and
the
people
who
thronged
it
screamed
still
more
shrilly
as
their
feet
were
crushed
by
the
grinding
blocks
and
now
too
the
great
pyramid
itself
was
commencing
to
split
and
gape
and
topple
the
roofs
of
its
splendid
chambers
gave
way
and
the
ponderous
masonry
above
shuttered
down
and
filled
them
in
part
too
one
could
see
the
destruction
now
and
not
guess
at
it
merely
from
the
fearful
hearings
of
the
darkness
thunders
had
begun
to
roar
through
the
black
night
above
and
add
their
bellowings
to
this
devil
s
orchestration
of
uproar
and
vivid
lightning
splashes
lit
the
flying
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
she
should
be
there
but
it
came
as
a
shock
when
a
flare
of
the
lightning
showed
me
phorenice
safe
out
in
the
square
and
indeed
standing
not
far
from
myself
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
middle
of
a
great
flagstone
and
stood
there
swaying
her
supple
body
to
the
shocks
her
face
was
calm
and
its
loveliness
was
untouched
by
the
years
from
time
to
time
she
brushed
away
the
dust
as
it
settled
on
the
short
red
hair
which
curled
about
her
neck
there
was
no
trace
of
fear
written
upon
her
face
there
was
some
weariness
some
contempt
and
i
think
a
tinge
of
amusement
yes
it
took
more
than
the
crumbling
of
her
royal
pyramid
to
impress
phorenice
with
the
infinite
powers
of
those
she
warred
against
gods
how
the
sight
of
her
cool
indifference
maddened
me
then
i
had
it
in
me
to
have
strangled
her
with
my
hands
if
she
had
come
within
my
reach
but
as
it
was
she
stood
in
her
place
swaying
easily
to
the
as
a
sailor
sways
on
a
ship
s
deck
and
beside
her
crouched
on
the
same
great
flagstone
and
overcome
with
nausea
was
ylga
who
again
was
raised
to
be
her
it
came
to
my
mind
that
ylga
was
twin
sister
to
nais
and
that
i
owed
her
for
an
ancient
kindness
but
i
had
leisure
to
do
nothing
for
her
then
and
indeed
it
was
little
enough
i
could
have
done
with
each
shock
the
great
capstone
of
the
throne
to
which
i
clung
jarred
farther
and
farther
from
its
bed
place
and
my
love
was
coming
nearer
to
me
it
was
she
who
claimed
all
my
service
then
once
in
their
blind
panic
a
knot
of
the
people
in
the
square
thought
that
the
granite
stone
was
too
solid
to
be
overturned
and
saw
in
it
an
oasis
of
safety
they
flocked
towards
it
many
of
them
dragging
themselves
up
the
steep
deep
high
steps
on
hands
and
knees
because
their
feet
had
been
injured
by
the
billowing
flagstones
of
the
square
but
i
was
in
no
mood
to
have
the
place
profaned
by
their
silly
tremblings
and
stares
i
beat
at
them
with
my
hands
tearing
them
away
and
hurling
them
back
down
the
steepness
of
the
steps
they
asked
me
what
was
my
title
to
the
place
above
their
own
and
i
answered
them
with
blows
and
gnashing
teeth
i
was
careless
as
to
what
they
thought
me
or
who
they
thought
me
only
i
wished
them
gone
and
so
they
went
wailing
and
crying
that
i
was
a
devil
of
the
night
for
they
had
no
spirit
left
to
defend
themselves
farther
and
farther
the
great
stone
that
made
the
top
of
the
throne
slid
out
from
its
bed
but
its
slowness
of
movement
maddened
me
a
life
s
education
left
me
in
that
moment
and
i
had
no
trace
of
stately
patience
left
in
my
puny
fury
i
thrust
at
the
great
block
with
my
shoulder
and
head
and
clawed
at
it
with
my
hands
till
the
muscles
rose
on
me
in
great
ropes
and
knots
and
the
high
gods
must
have
laughed
at
my
helplessness
as
they
looked
all
was
being
ordered
by
the
three
who
were
their
trusted
servants
in
their
good
time
the
work
of
the
gods
may
be
done
slowly
but
it
is
done
exceeding
sure
but
at
last
when
all
the
people
of
the
city
were
numb
with
terror
and
incapable
of
further
emotion
save
only
for
phorenice
who
still
had
nerve
enough
to
show
no
concern
what
had
been
threatened
came
to
pass
the
capstone
of
the
throne
slid
out
till
it
reached
the
balance
and
the
next
shock
threw
it
with
a
roar
and
a
clatter
to
the
ground
and
then
a
strange
tremor
seized
me
after
all
the
scheming
and
effort
what
i
had
so
ardently
prayed
for
had
come
about
but
yet
my
inwards
sank
at
the
thought
of
mounting
on
the
stone
where
i
had
mounted
before
and
taking
my
dear
from
the
hollow
where
my
hands
had
laid
her
i
knew
phorenice
s
vengefulness
and
had
a
high
value
for
her
cleverness
had
she
left
nais
to
lie
in
peace
or
had
she
stolen
her
away
to
suffer
indignities
elsewhere
or
had
she
ended
her
sleep
with
death
and
as
a
grisly
jest
left
the
corpse
for
my
finding
i
could
not
tell
i
dared
not
guess
never
during
a
whole
life
have
my
emotions
been
so
wrenched
as
they
were
at
that
moment
and
for
excuse
it
must
be
owned
that
love
for
nais
had
sapped
my
hardihood
over
a
matter
in
which
she
was
so
privately
concerned
it
began
to
come
to
my
mind
however
that
the
infernal
uproar
of
the
earth
tremor
was
beginning
to
slacken
somewhat
as
though
zaemon
knew
he
had
done
the
work
that
he
had
promised
and
was
minded
to
give
the
wretched
city
a
breathing
space
so
i
took
my
fortitude
in
hand
and
clambered
up
on
to
the
flat
of
the
stone
the
lightning
flashes
had
ceased
and
all
was
darkness
again
and
stifling
dust
but
at
any
moment
the
sky
might
be
lit
once
more
and
if
i
were
seen
in
that
place
shaggy
and
changed
though
i
might
be
phorenice
if
she
were
standing
near
would
not
be
slow
to
guess
my
name
and
errand
so
changed
was
i
for
the
moment
that
i
will
finely
confess
that
the
idea
of
a
fight
was
loathsome
to
me
then
i
wanted
to
have
my
business
done
and
get
gone
from
the
place
with
hands
that
shook
i
fumbled
over
the
face
of
the
stone
and
found
the
clamps
and
bars
of
metal
still
in
position
where
i
had
clenched
them
and
then
reverently
i
let
my
fingers
pass
between
these
and
felt
the
curves
of
my
love
s
body
in
its
rest
beneath
an
exultation
began
to
whirl
within
me
i
did
not
know
if
she
had
been
touched
since
i
last
left
her
i
did
not
know
if
the
drug
would
have
its
due
effect
and
let
her
be
awakened
to
warmth
and
sight
again
but
dead
or
alive
i
had
her
there
and
she
was
mine
mine
mine
and
i
could
have
yelled
aloud
in
my
joy
at
her
possession
still
the
earth
shook
beneath
us
and
masonry
roared
and
crashed
into
ruin
i
had
to
cling
to
my
place
with
one
hand
whilst
i
unhasped
the
clamps
of
metal
that
made
the
top
of
her
prison
with
the
other
but
at
last
i
swung
the
upper
half
of
them
clear
and
those
which
pinned
down
her
feet
i
let
remain
i
stooped
and
drew
her
soft
body
up
on
to
the
flat
of
the
stone
beside
me
and
pressed
my
lips
a
hundred
times
to
the
face
i
could
not
see
some
mad
thought
took
me
i
believe
that
the
mere
fierceness
and
heat
of
my
kisses
would
bring
her
back
again
to
life
and
wakefulness
indeed
i
will
own
plainly
that
i
did
but
sorry
credit
to
my
training
in
calmness
that
night
but
she
lay
in
my
arms
cold
and
nerveless
as
a
corpse
and
by
degrees
my
sober
wits
returned
to
me
this
was
no
place
for
either
of
us
let
the
earth
s
tremors
cease
as
was
plainly
threatened
let
daylight
come
and
let
a
few
of
these
nerveless
people
round
recover
from
their
panic
and
all
the
great
cost
that
had
been
expended
might
be
counted
as
waste
we
should
be
seen
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
some
one
put
a
name
to
nais
and
then
it
would
be
an
easy
matter
to
guess
at
deucalion
under
the
beard
and
the
shaggy
hair
and
the
browned
nakedness
of
the
savage
who
attended
on
her
tell
of
fright
by
the
gods
i
was
scared
as
the
veriest
trembler
who
blundered
amongst
the
that
night
when
the
thought
came
to
me
with
all
that
ruin
spread
around
it
would
be
hopeless
to
think
that
any
of
those
secret
galleries
which
tunnelled
under
the
ground
would
be
left
unbroken
and
so
it
was
useless
to
try
a
passage
under
the
walls
by
the
old
means
but
i
had
heard
shouts
from
that
frightened
mob
which
came
to
me
through
the
din
and
the
darkness
that
gave
another
idea
for
escape
the
city
is
accursed
they
had
cried
if
we
stay
here
it
will
fall
on
us
let
us
get
outside
the
walls
where
there
are
no
buildings
to
bury
if
they
went
i
could
not
see
but
one
gate
lay
nearest
to
the
royal
pyramid
and
i
judged
that
in
their
panic
they
would
not
go
farther
than
was
needful
so
i
put
the
body
of
nais
over
my
shoulder
to
leave
my
right
arm
free
and
blundered
off
as
best
i
could
through
the
stifling
darkness
it
was
hard
to
find
a
direction
it
was
hard
to
walk
in
the
inky
darkness
over
ground
that
was
tossed
and
tumbled
like
a
frozen
sea
and
as
the
earth
still
quaked
and
heaved
it
was
hard
also
to
keep
a
footing
but
if
i
did
fall
myself
a
score
of
times
my
dear
burden
got
no
bruise
and
presently
i
got
to
the
skirts
of
the
square
and
found
a
street
i
knew
the
most
venomous
part
of
the
shaking
was
done
and
no
more
buildings
fell
but
enough
lay
sprawled
over
the
roadway
to
make
walking
into
a
climb
and
the
sweat
rolled
from
me
as
i
laboured
along
my
way
there
was
no
difficulty
about
passing
the
gate
there
was
no
gate
there
was
no
wall
the
gods
had
driven
their
plough
through
it
and
it
lay
flat
and
proud
atlantis
stood
as
defenceless
as
the
open
country
though
i
knew
the
cause
of
this
ruin
though
in
fact
i
had
myself
in
some
measure
incited
it
i
was
almost
sad
at
the
ruthlessness
with
which
it
had
been
carried
out
the
royal
pyramid
might
go
houses
and
palaces
might
be
levelled
and
for
these
i
cared
little
enough
but
when
i
saw
those
stately
ramparts
also
filched
away
there
the
soldier
in
me
woke
and
i
grieved
at
this
humbling
of
the
mighty
city
that
once
had
been
my
only
mistress
but
this
was
only
a
passing
regret
a
mere
touch
of
the
s
pride
i
had
a
different
love
now
that
had
wrapped
herself
round
me
far
deeper
and
more
tightly
and
my
duty
was
towards
her
first
and
foremost
the
night
would
soon
be
past
and
then
dangers
would
increase
none
had
interfered
with
us
so
far
though
many
had
jostled
us
as
i
clambered
over
the
ruins
but
this
forbearance
could
not
be
reckoned
upon
for
long
the
earth
tremors
had
almost
died
away
and
after
the
panic
and
the
storm
then
comes
the
time
for
the
spoiling
all
men
who
were
poor
would
try
to
seize
what
lay
nearest
to
their
hands
and
those
of
higher
station
and
any
soldiers
who
could
be
collected
and
still
remained
true
to
command
would
ruthlessly
stop
and
strip
any
man
they
saw
making
off
with
plunder
i
had
no
mind
to
clash
with
these
guardians
of
law
and
property
and
so
i
fled
on
swiftly
through
the
night
with
my
burden
using
the
unfrequented
ways
and
crying
to
the
few
folk
who
did
meet
me
that
the
woman
had
the
plague
and
would
they
lend
me
the
shelter
of
their
house
as
ours
had
fallen
and
so
in
time
we
came
to
the
place
where
the
rope
dangled
from
the
precipice
and
after
nais
had
been
drawn
up
to
the
safety
of
the
sacred
mountain
i
put
my
leg
in
the
loop
of
the
rope
and
followed
her
now
came
what
was
the
keenest
anxiety
of
all
we
took
the
girl
and
laid
her
on
a
bed
in
one
of
the
houses
and
there
in
the
lit
room
for
the
first
time
i
saw
her
clearly
her
beauty
was
drawn
and
pale
her
eyes
were
closed
but
so
thin
and
transparent
had
grown
the
lids
that
one
could
almost
see
the
brown
of
the
pupil
beneath
them
her
hair
had
grown
to
inordinate
thickness
and
length
and
lay
as
a
cushion
behind
and
beside
her
head
there
was
no
flicker
of
breath
there
was
none
of
that
pulsing
of
the
body
which
denotes
life
but
still
she
had
not
the
appearance
of
ordinary
death
the
nais
i
had
placed
nine
long
years
before
to
rest
in
the
hollow
of
the
stone
was
a
fine
grown
woman
full
bosomed
and
well
boned
the
nais
that
remained
for
me
was
half
her
weight
the
old
nais
it
would
have
puzzled
me
to
carry
for
an
hour
this
was
no
burden
to
impede
a
grown
man
in
other
ways
too
she
had
altered
the
nails
of
her
fingers
had
grown
to
such
a
great
length
that
they
were
twisted
in
spirals
and
the
fingers
themselves
and
her
hands
were
so
waxy
and
transparent
that
the
bony
core
upon
which
they
were
built
showed
itself
beneath
the
flesh
in
plain
dull
outline
her
lips
were
so
white
that
one
sighed
to
remember
the
full
beauty
of
their
carmine
her
shoulders
and
neck
had
lost
their
comely
curves
and
made
bony
hollows
now
in
which
the
dust
of
entombment
lodged
black
and
thickly
reverently
i
set
about
preparing
those
things
which
if
all
went
well
should
restore
her
i
heated
water
and
filled
a
bath
and
tinctured
it
heavily
with
those
essences
of
the
life
of
beasts
which
the
priests
extract
and
store
against
times
of
urgent
need
and
sickness
i
laid
her
in
this
bath
and
sat
beside
it
to
watch
maintaining
that
bath
at
a
constant
blood
heat
an
hour
i
watched
two
hours
i
watched
three
hours
and
yet
she
showed
no
flicker
of
life
the
heat
of
her
body
given
her
by
the
bath
was
the
same
as
the
heat
of
my
own
but
in
the
feel
of
her
skin
when
i
stroked
it
with
my
hand
there
was
something
lacking
still
only
when
our
lord
the
sun
rose
for
his
day
did
i
break
off
my
watching
whilst
i
said
the
necessary
prayer
which
is
prescribed
and
quickly
returned
again
to
the
gloom
of
the
house
i
was
torn
with
anxiety
and
as
the
time
went
on
and
still
no
sign
of
life
came
back
the
hope
that
had
once
been
so
high
within
me
began
to
sicken
and
leave
me
downcast
and
despondent
from
without
came
the
din
of
fighting
already
phorenice
had
sent
her
troops
to
storm
the
passageway
and
the
priests
who
defended
it
were
shattering
them
with
volleys
of
rocks
but
these
sounds
of
war
woke
no
pulse
within
me
if
nais
did
not
wake
then
the
world
for
me
was
ended
and
i
had
no
spirit
left
to
care
who
remained
uppermost
the
gods
in
their
due
time
will
doubtless
smite
me
for
this
impiety
but
i
make
a
confession
of
it
here
on
these
sheets
having
no
mind
to
conceal
any
portion
of
this
history
for
the
small
reason
that
it
does
me
a
personal
discredit
but
as
the
hours
went
on
and
still
no
flicker
of
life
came
to
lessen
the
dumb
agony
that
racked
me
i
grew
more
venturesome
and
added
more
essences
to
the
bath
and
drugs
also
such
as
experience
had
shown
might
wake
the
disused
tissues
into
life
i
watched
on
with
staring
eyes
rubbing
her
wasted
body
now
and
again
and
always
keeping
the
heat
of
the
bath
at
a
constant
from
the
first
i
had
barred
the
door
against
all
who
would
have
come
near
to
help
me
with
my
own
hands
i
had
laid
my
love
to
sleep
and
i
could
not
bear
that
others
should
rouse
her
if
indeed
roused
she
should
ever
be
but
after
those
first
offers
no
others
came
and
the
snarl
and
din
of
fighting
told
of
what
occupied
them
it
is
hard
to
take
note
of
small
changes
which
occur
with
infinite
slowness
when
one
is
all
the
while
on
the
tense
watch
and
high
strung
though
my
senses
were
i
think
there
must
have
been
some
indication
of
returning
life
shown
before
i
was
keen
enough
to
notice
it
for
of
a
sudden
as
i
gazed
i
saw
a
faint
rippling
on
the
surface
of
the
water
of
the
bath
gods
would
it
come
back
again
to
my
love
at
last
this
life
this
wakefulness
the
ripple
died
out
as
it
had
come
and
i
stooped
my
head
nearer
to
the
bath
to
try
if
i
could
see
some
faint
heaving
of
her
bosom
some
small
twitching
of
the
limbs
no
she
lay
there
still
without
even
a
flutter
of
movement
but
as
i
watched
surely
it
seemed
to
my
aching
eyes
that
some
tinge
was
beginning
to
warm
that
blank
whiteness
of
skin
how
i
filled
myself
with
that
sight
the
colour
was
returning
to
her
again
beyond
a
doubt
once
more
the
dried
blood
was
becoming
fluid
and
beginning
again
to
course
in
its
old
channels
her
hair
floated
out
in
the
liquid
of
the
bath
like
some
brown
tangle
of
the
ocean
weed
and
ever
and
again
it
twitched
and
eddied
to
some
impulse
which
in
itself
was
too
small
for
the
eye
to
see
she
had
slept
for
nine
long
years
and
i
knew
that
the
wakening
could
be
none
of
the
suddenest
indeed
it
came
by
its
own
gradations
and
with
infinite
slowness
and
i
did
not
dare
do
more
to
hasten
it
further
drugs
might
very
well
stop
eternally
what
those
which
had
been
used
already
had
begun
so
i
sat
motionless
where
i
was
and
watched
the
colour
come
back
and
the
waxenness
go
and
even
the
fullness
of
her
curves
in
some
small
measure
return
and
when
growing
strength
gave
her
power
to
endure
them
and
she
was
racked
with
those
pains
which
are
inevitable
to
being
born
back
again
in
this
fashion
to
life
i
too
felt
the
reflex
of
her
agony
and
writhed
in
loving
sympathy
still
further
too
was
i
wrung
by
a
torment
of
doubt
as
to
whether
life
or
these
rackings
would
in
the
end
be
conqueror
after
each
paroxysm
the
colour
ebbed
back
from
her
again
and
for
a
while
she
would
lie
motionless
but
strength
and
power
seemed
gradually
to
grow
and
at
last
these
prevailed
and
drove
death
and
sleep
beneath
them
her
eyelids
struggled
with
their
fastenings
her
lips
parted
and
her
bosom
heaved
with
shivering
gasps
her
breath
began
to
pant
between
her
reddening
lips
at
first
it
rattled
dryly
in
her
throat
but
soon
it
softened
and
became
more
regular
and
then
with
a
last
effort
her
eyes
her
glorious
loving
eyes
slowly
opened
i
leaned
over
and
called
her
softly
by
name
her
eyes
met
mine
and
a
glow
arose
from
their
depths
that
gave
me
the
greatest
joy
i
have
met
in
all
the
world
deucalion
my
love
she
whispered
oh
my
dear
so
you
have
come
for
me
how
i
have
dreamed
of
you
how
i
have
been
racked
but
it
was
worth
it
all
for
storm
of
the
sacred
mountain
it
was
nais
herself
who
sent
me
to
attend
to
my
sterner
duties
the
din
of
the
attack
came
to
us
in
the
house
where
i
was
tending
her
and
she
asked
its
meaning
as
pithily
as
might
be
for
she
was
in
no
condition
for
tedious
listening
i
gave
her
the
history
of
her
nine
years
sleep
the
colour
flushed
more
to
her
face
my
lord
is
the
properest
man
in
all
the
world
to
be
king
she
whispered
i
refused
to
touch
the
trade
till
they
had
given
me
the
queen
i
desired
safe
and
alive
here
upon
the
how
we
poor
women
are
made
the
chattels
of
you
men
but
for
myself
i
seem
to
like
the
traffic
well
enough
you
should
not
have
let
me
stand
in
the
way
of
atlantis
good
deucalion
still
it
is
very
sweet
to
know
you
were
weak
there
for
once
and
that
i
was
the
cause
of
your
weakness
what
is
that
bath
over
yonder
ah
i
remember
my
wits
seem
none
of
the
clearest
just
you
have
made
the
beginning
your
strength
will
return
to
you
by
quick
degrees
but
it
will
not
bear
hurrying
you
must
have
a
your
ear
sir
for
one
moment
and
then
i
will
rest
in
peace
my
poor
looks
are
they
all
gone
you
seem
to
have
no
mirror
here
i
had
visions
that
i
should
wake
up
wrinkled
and
you
are
as
you
were
dear
that
first
night
i
saw
you
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
all
the
i
am
pleased
you
like
me
she
said
and
took
the
cup
of
broth
i
offered
her
my
hair
seems
to
have
grown
but
it
needs
combing
sadly
i
had
a
fancy
dear
once
that
you
liked
ruddy
hair
best
and
not
a
plain
she
closed
her
eyes
then
lying
back
amongst
the
cushions
where
i
had
placed
her
and
dropped
off
into
healthy
sleep
with
the
smiles
still
playing
upon
her
lips
i
put
the
coverlet
over
her
and
kissed
her
lightly
holding
back
my
beard
lest
it
should
sweep
her
cheek
and
then
i
went
out
of
the
chamber
that
beard
had
grown
vastly
disagreeable
to
me
these
last
hours
and
then
i
went
into
a
room
in
the
house
and
found
instruments
and
shaved
it
down
to
the
bare
chin
a
change
of
robe
also
i
found
there
and
took
it
instead
of
my
squalid
rags
if
a
man
is
in
truth
a
king
he
owes
these
things
to
the
dignity
of
his
office
but
if
the
din
of
the
fighting
was
any
guide
mine
was
a
narrowing
kingdom
every
hour
it
seemed
to
grow
fiercer
and
more
near
and
it
was
clear
that
some
of
the
gates
in
the
passage
up
the
cleft
in
the
cliff
impregnable
though
all
men
had
thought
them
had
yielded
to
the
vehemence
of
phorenice
s
attack
and
indeed
it
was
scarcely
to
be
marvelled
at
with
all
her
genius
spurred
on
to
fury
by
the
blow
that
had
been
struck
at
her
by
wrecking
so
fair
a
part
of
the
city
the
empress
would
be
no
light
adversary
even
for
a
strong
place
to
resist
and
the
sacred
mountain
was
no
longer
strong
defences
of
stone
cunningly
planned
and
mightily
built
it
still
possessed
but
these
will
not
fight
alone
they
need
men
to
line
them
and
moreover
abundance
of
men
for
always
in
a
storm
of
this
kind
some
desperate
fellows
will
spit
at
death
and
get
to
hand
grips
or
slingers
and
archers
slip
in
their
shot
or
the
gets
home
or
as
here
some
newfangled
machine
like
phorenice
s
make
one
in
a
thousand
of
their
wavering
darts
find
the
life
and
so
though
the
general
attacking
loses
his
hundreds
the
defenders
also
are
not
without
their
dead
the
slaughter
as
it
turned
out
had
been
prodigious
as
fast
as
the
stormers
came
up
the
priests
who
held
the
lowest
gate
remaining
to
us
rained
down
great
rocks
upon
them
till
the
narrow
alley
of
the
stair
was
paved
with
their
writhing
dead
but
phorenice
stood
on
a
spur
of
the
rock
below
them
urging
on
the
charges
and
with
an
insane
valour
company
after
company
marched
up
to
hurl
themselves
hopelessly
against
the
defences
they
had
no
machines
to
batter
the
massive
gates
and
their
attack
was
as
pathetically
useless
as
that
of
a
child
who
hammers
against
a
wall
with
an
orange
and
meanwhile
the
terrible
stones
from
above
mowed
them
down
remorselessly
company
after
company
of
the
troops
marched
into
this
terrible
and
not
a
man
of
all
of
them
ever
came
back
nor
was
it
phorenice
s
policy
that
they
should
do
so
in
her
lust
for
this
final
conquest
she
was
minded
to
pour
out
troops
till
she
had
filled
up
the
passes
with
the
slain
so
that
at
last
she
might
march
on
to
a
level
fight
over
the
bridge
of
their
poor
bodies
it
was
no
part
of
phorenice
s
mood
ever
to
count
the
cost
she
set
down
the
object
which
was
to
be
gained
and
it
was
her
policy
that
the
people
of
atlantis
were
there
to
gain
it
for
her
two
gates
then
had
she
carried
in
this
dreadful
fashion
slaughtering
those
priests
that
stood
behind
them
who
had
not
been
already
shot
down
and
here
i
came
down
from
above
to
take
my
share
in
the
fight
there
was
no
trumpet
to
announce
my
coming
no
herald
to
proclaim
my
quality
but
the
priests
as
a
sheer
custom
picked
up
deucalion
as
a
and
some
shouted
that
with
a
king
to
lead
there
would
be
no
further
ground
lost
it
was
clear
that
the
name
carried
to
the
other
side
and
bore
weight
with
it
a
company
of
poor
doomed
wretches
who
were
hurrying
up
stopped
in
their
charge
the
word
deucalion
was
bandied
round
and
handed
back
down
the
line
i
thought
with
some
grim
satisfaction
that
here
was
evidence
i
was
not
completely
forgotten
in
the
land
there
came
shouts
to
them
from
behind
to
carry
on
their
advance
but
they
did
not
budge
and
presently
a
glittering
officer
panted
up
and
commenced
to
strike
right
and
left
amongst
them
with
his
sword
from
where
i
stood
on
the
high
rampart
above
the
gate
i
could
see
him
plainly
and
recognised
him
at
once
it
matters
not
what
they
use
for
their
he
was
shouting
you
have
the
orders
of
your
divine
empress
and
that
is
enough
you
should
be
proud
to
die
for
her
wish
you
cowards
and
if
you
do
not
obey
you
will
die
afterwards
under
the
instruments
of
the
tormentors
very
painfully
as
for
deucalion
he
is
dead
any
time
these
nine
there
it
seems
you
lie
my
lord
tatho
i
shouted
down
to
him
he
started
and
looked
up
at
me
so
you
are
there
in
real
truth
then
well
old
comrade
i
am
sorry
but
it
is
too
late
to
make
a
composition
now
you
are
on
the
side
of
these
mangy
priests
and
the
empress
has
made
an
edict
that
they
are
to
be
rooted
out
and
i
am
her
most
obedient
you
used
to
be
skilful
of
fence
i
said
and
indeed
there
was
little
enough
to
choose
between
us
if
it
please
you
to
stop
this
pitiful
killing
make
yourself
the
champion
of
your
side
and
i
will
stand
for
mine
and
we
will
fight
out
this
quarrel
in
some
fair
place
and
bind
our
parties
to
abide
by
the
it
would
be
a
grand
fight
between
us
two
old
friend
and
it
goes
hard
with
me
to
balk
you
of
it
but
i
can
not
pleasure
you
i
am
general
here
under
phorenice
and
she
has
given
me
the
strongest
orders
not
to
peril
myself
and
besides
though
you
are
a
great
man
deucalion
you
are
not
chief
you
are
not
even
one
of
the
i
am
tatho
laughed
few
but
yourself
would
say
so
my
few
truly
but
what
there
are
they
are
powerful
i
was
given
the
name
for
the
first
time
yesterday
and
as
a
first
blow
in
the
campaign
there
was
some
mischief
done
in
the
city
i
was
there
myself
and
saw
how
you
took
you
were
in
atlantis
i
went
for
nais
she
is
on
the
mountain
now
and
will
be
my
queen
tatho
as
a
priest
to
a
priest
let
me
solemnly
bring
to
your
memory
the
infinite
power
you
bite
against
on
this
sacred
mountain
your
teaching
has
warned
you
of
the
weapons
that
are
stored
in
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
if
you
persist
in
this
attack
at
the
best
you
can
merely
lose
at
the
worst
you
can
bring
about
a
wreck
over
which
even
the
high
gods
will
shudder
as
they
order
you
can
not
scare
us
back
now
by
words
said
tatho
doggedly
and
as
for
magic
it
will
be
met
by
magic
phorenice
has
found
by
her
own
cleverness
as
many
powers
as
were
ever
stored
up
in
the
ark
of
the
yet
she
looked
on
helplessly
enough
last
night
when
her
royal
pyramid
was
trundled
into
a
rubbish
heap
zaemon
had
prophesied
that
this
should
be
so
and
for
a
witness
why
i
myself
stood
closer
to
her
than
we
two
stand
now
and
saw
i
will
own
you
took
her
by
surprise
somewhat
there
i
do
not
understand
these
matters
myself
i
was
never
more
than
one
of
the
seven
in
the
old
days
and
now
quite
rightly
phorenice
keeps
the
knowledge
of
her
magic
to
herself
but
it
seems
time
is
needed
when
one
magic
is
to
be
met
by
well
i
said
i
know
little
about
the
business
either
i
leave
these
matters
now
to
those
who
are
higher
above
me
in
the
priesthood
indeed
having
a
liking
for
nais
it
seems
i
am
debarred
from
ever
being
given
understanding
about
the
highest
of
the
higher
mysteries
so
i
content
myself
with
being
a
soldier
and
when
the
appointed
day
comes
i
shall
fall
and
kiss
my
mother
the
earth
for
the
last
time
you
so
i
am
told
have
ambition
for
longer
he
nodded
phorenice
has
found
the
great
secret
and
i
am
to
be
the
first
that
will
share
it
with
her
we
shall
be
as
gods
upon
the
earth
seeing
that
death
will
be
powerless
to
touch
us
and
the
twin
sons
she
has
borne
me
will
be
made
immortal
phorenice
is
headstrong
no
my
lord
there
is
no
need
to
shake
your
head
and
try
to
deny
it
i
have
had
some
acquaintance
with
her
but
the
order
has
been
made
and
her
immortality
will
be
snatched
from
her
very
rudely
now
mark
solemnly
my
words
i
deucalion
have
been
appointed
king
of
atlantis
by
the
high
council
of
the
priests
who
are
the
mouthpiece
of
the
most
high
gods
and
if
i
do
not
have
my
reign
then
there
will
be
no
atlantis
left
to
carry
either
king
or
empress
you
know
me
tatho
for
a
man
that
never
he
nodded
then
save
yourself
before
it
is
too
late
you
shall
have
again
your
in
but
man
there
is
no
yucatan
a
great
horde
of
little
hairy
creatures
that
were
something
less
than
human
and
something
more
than
beasts
swept
down
upon
our
cities
and
ate
them
out
oh
you
may
sneer
if
you
choose
others
sneered
when
i
came
home
till
the
empress
stopped
them
but
you
know
what
a
train
of
driver
ants
is
that
you
meet
with
in
the
forests
you
may
light
fires
across
their
path
and
they
will
march
into
them
in
their
blind
bravery
and
put
them
out
with
their
bodies
and
those
that
are
left
will
march
on
in
an
unbroken
column
and
devour
all
that
stands
in
their
path
i
tell
you
my
lord
those
little
hairy
creatures
were
like
the
ants
aye
for
numbers
and
wooden
bravery
as
well
as
for
appetite
as
a
result
there
is
no
you
shall
have
egypt
he
burst
at
me
hotly
i
would
not
take
seven
egypts
and
ten
yucatans
my
lord
you
think
more
poorly
of
me
than
is
kind
when
you
ask
me
to
become
a
traitor
in
your
place
would
you
throw
your
nais
away
if
the
doing
it
would
save
you
from
a
danger
that
is
in
no
degree
you
have
a
kindness
for
her
i
have
all
that
and
more
for
phorenice
who
is
besides
my
wife
and
the
mother
of
my
children
if
i
have
qualms
and
i
freely
confess
i
know
you
are
desperate
men
up
there
and
have
dreadful
powers
at
your
command
my
shiverings
are
for
them
and
not
for
myself
but
i
think
my
lord
this
parley
is
leading
to
nothing
and
though
these
common
soldiers
here
will
understand
little
enough
of
our
talk
they
may
be
picking
up
a
word
here
and
there
and
i
do
not
wish
them
to
go
on
to
their
death
as
you
will
see
them
do
shortly
and
carry
evil
reports
about
me
to
whatever
gods
they
chance
to
come
he
saluted
me
with
his
sword
and
drew
back
and
once
more
the
missiles
began
to
fly
and
the
doomed
wretches
who
had
been
halting
beside
the
steep
rock
walls
of
the
pass
began
once
more
to
press
hopelessly
forward
they
had
certainly
but
they
had
no
chance
of
getting
these
planted
they
could
do
naught
but
fill
the
narrow
way
with
their
bodies
and
to
that
end
they
had
been
sent
and
to
that
end
they
humbly
died
our
priests
with
crow
and
lever
wrenched
from
their
the
great
rocks
which
had
been
made
ready
and
sent
them
crashing
down
so
that
once
more
screams
filled
the
pass
and
the
horrid
butchery
was
renewed
but
ever
and
again
some
arrow
or
some
or
some
s
dart
would
find
its
way
up
from
below
and
through
the
defences
and
there
we
would
be
with
a
man
the
less
to
carry
on
the
fight
it
was
well
enough
for
phorenice
to
be
lavish
with
her
troops
indeed
if
she
wished
for
success
there
were
no
two
ways
for
it
and
when
those
she
had
levied
were
killed
she
could
readily
press
others
into
the
service
seeing
that
she
had
the
whole
broad
face
of
the
country
under
her
rule
but
with
us
it
was
different
a
man
down
on
our
side
was
a
man
whose
arm
would
bitterly
be
missed
and
one
which
could
in
no
possible
way
be
replaced
i
made
calculation
of
the
chances
and
saw
clearly
that
if
we
continued
the
fight
on
the
present
plan
they
would
storm
the
gates
one
after
another
as
they
came
to
them
and
that
by
the
time
the
uppermost
gate
was
reached
there
would
be
no
priest
alive
to
defend
it
and
so
not
disdaining
to
fashion
myself
on
phorenice
s
newer
plan
which
held
that
a
general
should
at
times
in
preference
plot
coldly
from
a
place
of
some
safety
and
not
lead
the
thick
of
the
fighting
i
left
those
who
stood
to
the
gate
with
some
rough
soldier
s
words
of
cheer
and
withdrew
again
up
the
narrow
stair
of
the
pass
this
one
approach
to
the
sacred
mountain
was
as
i
have
said
before
vastly
more
difficult
and
dangerous
in
the
olden
days
when
it
stood
as
a
mere
bare
cleft
as
the
high
gods
made
it
but
a
chasm
had
been
bridged
here
a
shelf
cut
through
the
solid
rock
there
and
in
many
places
the
roadway
was
built
up
on
piers
from
distant
crags
below
so
as
to
make
all
uniform
and
easy
it
came
to
my
mind
now
that
if
i
could
destroy
this
path
we
might
gain
a
breathing
space
for
further
effort
the
idea
seemed
good
or
at
least
no
other
occurred
to
me
which
would
in
any
way
relieve
our
desperate
situation
and
i
looked
around
me
for
means
to
put
it
into
execution
up
and
down
from
the
mountain
to
the
plains
below
i
had
traversed
that
narrow
stair
of
a
pass
some
thousands
of
times
and
so
in
a
manner
of
speaking
knew
every
stone
and
every
turn
and
every
cut
of
it
by
heart
but
i
had
never
looked
upon
it
with
an
eye
to
shaving
off
all
roadway
to
the
sacred
mountain
and
so
now
even
in
this
moment
of
dreadful
stress
i
had
to
traverse
it
no
less
than
three
times
afresh
before
i
could
decide
upon
the
best
site
for
demolition
but
once
the
point
was
fixed
there
was
little
delay
in
getting
the
scheme
in
movement
already
i
had
sent
men
to
the
storehouses
amongst
the
priests
dwellings
to
fetch
me
rams
and
crows
and
acids
and
hammers
and
such
other
material
as
was
needed
and
these
stood
handy
behind
one
of
the
upper
gates
i
put
on
every
pair
of
hands
that
could
be
spared
to
the
work
no
matter
what
was
their
age
and
feebleness
yes
if
nais
could
have
walked
so
far
i
would
have
pressed
her
for
the
labour
and
presently
carved
balustrade
and
wayside
statue
together
with
the
lettered
and
the
cobbles
roared
down
into
the
gulf
below
and
added
their
din
to
the
shrieks
and
yells
and
crashes
of
the
fighting
gods
but
it
was
a
hateful
task
smashing
down
that
splendid
handiwork
of
the
men
of
the
past
but
it
was
better
that
it
should
crash
down
to
ruin
in
the
abyss
below
than
that
phorenice
should
profane
it
with
her
impious
sandals
at
first
i
had
feared
that
it
would
be
needful
to
sacrifice
the
knot
of
brave
men
who
were
so
valiantly
defending
the
gate
then
being
attacked
it
is
disgusting
to
be
forced
into
a
measure
of
this
kind
but
in
hard
warfare
it
is
often
needful
to
the
carrying
out
of
his
schemes
for
a
general
to
leave
a
part
of
his
troops
to
fight
to
a
finish
and
without
hope
of
rescue
as
valiantly
as
they
may
and
all
he
can
do
for
their
reward
is
to
recommend
them
earnestly
to
the
care
of
the
gods
but
when
the
work
of
destroying
the
pathway
was
nearly
completed
i
saw
a
chance
of
retrieving
them
we
had
not
been
content
merely
with
breaking
arches
and
throwing
down
the
piers
we
had
got
our
rams
and
levers
under
the
living
rock
itself
on
which
all
the
whole
fabric
stood
and
fire
stood
ready
to
heat
the
rams
for
their
work
and
when
the
word
was
given
the
whole
could
be
sent
crashing
down
the
face
of
the
cliffs
beyond
chance
of
repair
all
was
i
say
finally
prepared
in
this
fashion
and
then
i
gave
the
word
to
hold
a
narrow
ledge
still
remained
undestroyed
and
offered
footway
and
over
this
i
crossed
the
cut
we
had
made
was
immediately
below
the
uppermost
gate
of
all
and
below
it
there
were
three
more
massive
gates
still
unviolated
besides
the
one
then
being
so
vehemently
attacked
already
the
garrisons
had
been
retired
from
these
and
i
passed
through
them
all
in
turn
unchallenged
and
unchecked
and
came
to
that
busy
rampart
where
the
twelve
priests
left
alive
worked
stripped
to
the
waist
at
heaving
down
the
murderous
rocks
for
awhile
i
busied
myself
at
their
side
stopping
an
occasional
dart
or
arrow
on
my
shield
and
passing
them
the
tidings
the
attack
was
growing
fiercer
every
minute
now
the
enemy
had
packed
the
pass
below
full
of
their
dead
and
our
battering
stones
had
less
distance
to
fall
and
so
could
do
less
execution
they
pressed
forward
more
eagerly
than
ever
with
their
scaling
ladders
and
it
was
plain
that
soon
they
would
inevitably
put
the
place
to
the
storm
even
during
the
short
time
i
was
there
their
and
missiles
took
life
from
three
more
of
the
twelve
who
stood
with
me
on
the
defence
so
i
gave
the
word
for
one
more
furious
avalanche
of
rock
to
be
pelted
down
and
whilst
the
few
living
were
crawling
out
from
those
killed
by
the
discharge
and
whilst
the
next
band
of
reinforcements
came
scrambling
up
over
the
bodies
i
sent
my
nine
remaining
men
away
at
a
run
up
the
steep
stairway
of
the
path
and
then
followed
them
myself
each
of
the
gates
in
turn
we
passed
shutting
them
after
us
and
breaking
the
bars
and
levers
with
which
they
were
moved
and
not
till
we
were
through
the
last
did
the
roar
of
shouts
from
below
tell
that
the
besiegers
had
found
the
gate
they
bit
against
was
deserted
one
by
one
we
balanced
our
way
across
the
narrow
ledge
which
was
left
where
the
path
had
been
destroyed
and
one
poor
priest
that
carried
a
wound
grew
giddy
and
lost
his
balance
here
and
toppled
down
to
his
death
in
the
abyss
below
before
a
hand
could
be
stretched
out
to
steady
him
and
then
when
we
were
all
over
heat
was
put
to
the
rams
and
they
expanded
with
their
resistless
force
and
tore
the
remaining
ledges
from
their
hold
in
the
rock
i
think
a
pang
went
through
us
all
then
when
we
saw
for
ourselves
the
last
connecting
link
cut
away
from
between
the
poor
remaining
handful
of
our
sacred
clan
on
the
mountain
and
the
rest
of
our
great
nation
who
had
grown
so
bitterly
estranged
to
us
below
but
here
at
any
rate
was
a
break
in
the
fighting
there
were
no
further
preparations
we
could
make
for
our
defence
and
high
though
i
knew
phorenice
s
genius
to
be
i
did
not
see
how
she
could
very
well
do
other
than
accept
the
check
and
retire
so
i
set
a
guard
on
the
ramparts
of
the
uppermost
gate
to
watch
all
possible
movements
and
gave
the
word
to
the
others
to
go
and
find
the
rest
which
so
much
they
needed
for
myself
dutifully
i
tried
to
find
zaemon
first
going
on
the
errand
my
proper
self
for
there
was
little
enough
of
kingly
state
observed
on
the
sacred
mountain
although
the
name
and
title
had
been
given
me
but
zaemon
was
not
to
be
come
at
he
was
engaged
inside
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
with
another
of
the
three
and
being
myself
only
one
of
the
seven
i
had
not
rank
enough
in
the
priesthood
to
break
in
upon
their
workings
and
so
i
was
free
to
turn
where
my
likings
would
have
led
me
first
and
that
was
to
the
house
which
sheltered
nais
she
waked
as
i
came
in
over
the
threshold
and
her
eyes
filled
with
a
welcome
for
me
i
went
across
and
knelt
where
she
lay
putting
my
face
on
the
pillow
beside
her
she
was
full
of
tender
talk
and
sweet
endearments
gods
what
an
infinity
of
delight
i
had
missed
by
not
knowing
my
nais
earlier
but
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
through
it
all
and
some
quaint
conceits
which
made
her
all
the
more
adorable
she
rallied
me
on
the
new
cleanness
of
my
chin
and
on
the
robe
which
i
had
taken
as
a
covering
she
professed
a
pretty
awe
for
my
kingship
and
vowed
that
had
she
known
of
my
coming
dignities
she
would
never
have
dared
to
discover
a
love
for
me
but
about
my
marriage
with
phorenice
she
spoke
with
less
lightness
she
put
out
her
thin
white
hand
and
drew
my
face
to
her
lips
it
is
weak
of
me
to
have
a
jealousy
she
murmured
knowing
how
completely
my
lord
is
mine
alone
but
i
can
not
help
it
you
have
said
you
were
her
husband
for
awhile
it
gives
me
a
pang
to
think
that
i
shall
not
be
the
first
to
lie
in
your
arms
then
you
may
gaily
throw
your
pang
away
i
whispered
back
i
was
husband
to
phorenice
in
mere
word
for
how
long
i
do
not
precisely
know
but
in
anything
beyond
i
was
never
her
husband
at
all
she
married
me
by
a
form
she
prescribed
herself
ignoring
all
the
old
rites
and
ceremonies
and
whether
it
would
hold
as
legal
or
not
we
need
not
trouble
to
inquire
she
herself
has
most
nicely
and
completely
annulled
that
marriage
as
i
have
told
you
tatho
is
her
husband
now
and
father
to
her
children
and
he
seems
to
have
a
fondness
for
her
which
does
him
we
said
other
things
too
in
that
chamber
those
small
repetitions
of
endearments
which
are
so
precious
to
lovers
and
so
beyond
the
comprehension
of
other
folk
but
they
are
not
to
be
set
down
on
these
sheets
they
are
a
mere
private
matter
which
can
have
no
concern
to
any
one
beyond
our
two
selves
and
more
weighty
subjects
are
piling
themselves
up
in
deep
index
for
the
historian
phorenice
it
seemed
had
more
rage
against
the
priests
clan
on
the
mountain
and
more
bright
genius
to
help
her
to
a
vengeance
than
i
had
credited
her
troops
stormed
easily
the
gates
we
had
left
to
them
and
swarmed
up
till
they
stood
where
the
pathway
was
broken
down
in
the
fierceness
of
their
rush
the
foremost
were
thrust
over
the
brink
by
those
pressing
up
behind
before
the
advance
could
be
halted
and
these
went
screaming
to
a
horrid
death
in
the
great
gulf
below
but
it
was
no
position
here
that
a
lavish
spending
of
men
could
take
and
presently
all
were
drawn
off
save
for
some
who
stood
as
outpost
sentries
and
dodged
out
of
behind
angles
of
the
rock
it
seems
too
that
the
empress
herself
reconnoitered
the
place
using
due
caution
and
quickness
and
so
got
for
herself
a
full
plan
of
its
requirements
without
being
obliged
to
trust
the
measuring
of
another
eye
with
extraordinary
nimbleness
she
must
have
planned
an
engine
such
as
was
necessary
to
suit
her
purposes
and
given
orders
for
its
making
for
even
with
the
vast
force
and
resources
at
her
disposal
the
speed
with
which
it
was
built
was
prodigious
there
was
very
little
noise
made
to
tell
of
what
was
afoot
all
the
woodwork
and
metalwork
was
cut
and
tongued
and
forged
and
fitted
first
by
skilled
craftsmen
below
in
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
cleft
and
when
each
ponderous
balk
and
each
crosspiece
and
each
plank
was
dragged
up
the
steep
pass
through
the
conquered
gates
it
was
ready
instantly
for
fitting
into
its
appointed
place
in
the
completed
machine
the
cleft
was
straight
where
they
set
about
their
building
and
there
was
no
curve
or
spur
of
the
cliff
to
hide
their
handiwork
from
those
of
the
priests
who
watched
from
the
ramparts
above
our
one
remaining
gate
but
phorenice
had
a
coyness
lest
her
engine
should
be
seen
before
it
was
completed
and
so
to
screen
it
she
had
a
vast
fire
built
at
the
uppermost
point
where
the
causeway
was
broken
off
and
fed
diligently
with
wet
sedge
and
green
wood
so
that
a
great
smoke
poured
out
rising
like
a
curtain
that
shut
out
all
view
and
so
though
the
priests
on
the
rampart
above
the
gate
picked
off
now
and
again
some
of
those
who
tended
the
fire
they
could
do
the
besiegers
no
further
injury
and
remained
up
to
the
last
quite
in
ignorance
of
their
tactics
the
passage
up
the
cleft
was
in
shadow
during
the
night
hours
for
though
all
the
crest
of
the
sacred
mountain
was
always
lit
brightly
by
the
eternal
fires
which
made
its
defence
on
the
farther
side
their
glow
threw
no
gleam
down
that
flank
where
the
cliff
ran
sheer
to
the
plains
beneath
and
so
it
was
under
cover
of
the
darkness
that
phorenice
brought
up
her
engine
into
position
for
attack
planking
had
been
laid
down
for
its
wheels
and
the
wheels
themselves
well
greased
and
it
may
be
that
she
hoped
to
march
in
upon
us
whilst
all
slept
but
there
was
a
certain
creaking
and
groaning
of
timbers
and
laboured
panting
of
men
which
gave
advertisement
that
something
was
being
attempted
and
the
alarm
was
spread
quietly
in
the
hope
that
if
a
surprise
had
been
planned
the
real
surprise
might
be
turned
the
other
way
a
messenger
came
to
me
running
where
i
sat
in
the
house
at
the
side
of
my
love
and
she
like
the
soldier
s
wife
she
was
made
to
be
kissed
me
and
bade
me
go
quickly
and
care
for
my
honour
and
bring
back
my
wounds
for
her
to
mend
on
the
rampart
above
the
gate
all
was
silence
save
for
the
faint
rustle
of
armed
men
and
out
of
the
black
darkness
ahead
and
from
the
other
side
of
the
broken
causeway
came
the
sounds
of
which
the
messenger
bad
warned
me
the
captain
of
the
gate
came
to
me
and
whispered
we
have
made
no
light
till
the
king
came
not
knowing
the
king
s
will
in
the
matter
is
it
wished
i
send
some
of
the
down
yonder
on
the
chance
that
it
does
some
harm
and
at
the
same
time
lights
up
the
place
or
is
it
willed
that
we
wait
for
their
surprise
send
the
fire
i
said
or
we
may
find
that
phorenice
s
brain
has
been
one
too
many
for
the
captain
of
the
gate
took
one
of
the
balls
in
his
hand
lit
the
fuse
and
hurled
it
the
horrid
thing
burst
amongst
a
mass
of
men
who
were
labouring
with
a
huge
engine
sputtering
them
with
its
deadly
fire
and
lighting
their
garments
the
plan
of
the
engine
showed
itself
plainly
they
had
built
them
a
vast
great
tower
resting
on
wheels
at
its
base
so
that
it
might
by
pushed
forward
from
behind
and
slanting
at
its
foot
to
allow
for
the
steepness
of
the
path
and
leave
it
always
upright
it
was
storeyed
inside
with
ladders
joining
each
floor
and
through
slits
in
the
side
which
faced
us
bowmen
could
cover
an
attack
from
its
top
a
great
bridge
reared
high
above
it
being
carried
vertically
till
the
tower
was
brought
near
enough
for
its
use
the
bridge
was
hinged
at
the
third
storey
of
the
tower
and
fastened
with
ropes
to
its
extreme
top
but
once
the
ropes
were
cut
the
bridge
would
fall
and
light
upon
whatever
came
within
its
swing
and
be
held
there
by
the
spikes
with
which
it
was
studded
beneath
i
saw
and
inwardly
felt
myself
conquered
the
cleverness
of
phorenice
had
been
too
strong
for
my
defence
no
of
which
we
had
command
could
overset
the
tower
the
whole
of
its
massive
timbers
were
hung
with
the
wet
skins
of
beasts
so
that
even
the
could
not
destroy
it
what
puny
means
we
had
to
impede
those
who
pushed
it
forward
would
have
little
effect
presently
it
would
come
to
the
place
appointed
and
the
ropes
would
be
cut
and
the
bridge
would
thunder
down
on
the
rampart
above
our
last
gate
and
the
stormers
would
pour
out
to
their
final
success
well
life
had
loomed
very
pleasant
for
me
these
few
days
with
a
warm
and
loving
nais
once
more
in
touch
of
my
arms
but
the
high
gods
in
their
infinite
wisdom
knew
best
always
and
i
was
no
rebel
to
stay
against
their
decision
but
it
is
ever
a
soldier
s
privilege
come
what
may
to
warm
over
a
fight
and
the
most
exquisitely
fierce
joy
of
all
is
that
final
fight
of
a
man
who
knows
that
he
must
die
and
who
lusts
only
to
make
his
bed
of
slain
high
enough
to
carry
a
due
memory
of
his
powers
with
those
who
afterwards
come
to
gaze
upon
it
i
gripped
my
axe
and
the
muscles
of
my
arms
stood
out
in
knots
at
the
thought
of
it
would
tatho
come
to
give
me
sport
i
feared
not
they
would
send
only
the
common
soldiers
first
to
the
storm
and
i
must
be
content
to
do
my
killing
on
those
and
nais
what
of
her
i
had
a
quiet
mind
there
when
any
spoilers
came
to
the
house
where
she
lay
she
would
know
that
deucalion
had
been
taken
up
to
the
gods
and
she
would
not
be
long
in
following
him
she
had
her
dagger
no
i
had
no
fears
of
being
parted
long
from
nais
now
destruction
of
atlantis
a
tottering
old
priest
came
up
and
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
well
i
said
sharply
having
small
taste
for
interruption
just
now
news
has
been
carried
to
the
three
my
king
of
what
is
then
they
will
know
that
i
stand
here
now
brother
to
enjoy
the
finest
fight
of
my
life
when
it
is
finished
i
shall
go
to
the
gods
and
be
there
standing
behind
the
stars
to
welcome
them
when
presently
they
also
arrive
they
have
my
regrets
that
they
are
too
old
and
too
feeble
to
die
and
look
upon
a
fine
killing
i
have
commands
from
them
my
king
to
lay
upon
you
which
i
fear
you
will
like
but
slenderly
you
are
forbidden
to
find
your
death
here
in
the
fighting
they
have
a
further
use
for
you
i
turned
on
the
old
man
angrily
enough
i
shall
take
no
such
order
my
brother
i
am
not
going
to
believe
it
was
ever
given
you
must
have
misunderstood
if
i
am
a
man
if
i
am
a
priest
if
i
am
a
soldier
if
i
am
a
king
then
it
stands
to
my
honour
that
no
enemy
should
pass
this
gate
whilst
yet
i
live
and
you
may
go
back
and
throw
that
message
at
their
the
old
man
smiled
enviously
he
too
had
been
a
keen
soldier
in
his
day
i
told
them
you
would
not
easily
believe
such
a
message
and
asked
them
for
a
sign
and
they
bore
with
me
and
gave
me
one
i
was
to
give
you
this
jewel
my
how
came
they
by
that
it
is
a
bracelet
from
the
elbow
of
they
must
have
stripped
her
of
it
i
did
not
know
it
came
from
nais
the
word
i
was
to
bring
you
said
that
the
owner
of
the
jewel
was
inside
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
and
waited
you
there
the
use
which
the
three
have
for
you
further
concerns
her
even
when
i
heard
that
i
will
freely
confess
that
my
obedience
was
sorely
tried
and
i
have
the
less
shame
in
setting
it
down
on
these
sheets
because
i
know
that
all
true
soldiers
will
feel
a
sympathy
for
my
plight
indeed
the
promise
of
the
battle
was
very
tempting
but
in
the
end
my
love
for
nais
prevailed
and
i
gave
the
salutation
that
was
needful
in
token
that
i
heard
the
order
and
obeyed
it
to
the
knot
of
priests
who
were
left
for
the
defence
i
turned
and
made
my
farewells
you
will
have
what
i
shall
miss
my
brothers
i
said
i
envy
you
that
fight
but
though
i
am
king
of
atlantis
still
i
am
only
one
of
the
seven
and
so
am
the
servant
of
the
three
and
must
obey
their
order
they
speak
in
words
the
will
of
the
most
high
gods
and
we
must
do
as
they
command
you
will
stand
behind
the
stars
before
i
come
and
i
ask
of
you
that
you
will
commend
me
to
those
you
meet
there
it
is
not
my
own
will
that
i
shall
not
appear
there
by
your
they
heard
my
words
with
smiles
and
very
courteously
saluted
me
with
their
weapons
and
there
we
parted
i
did
not
see
the
fight
but
i
know
it
was
good
from
the
time
which
passed
before
phorenice
s
hordes
broke
out
on
to
the
crest
of
the
mountain
they
died
hard
that
last
remnant
of
the
lesser
priests
of
atlantis
with
a
sour
enough
feeling
i
went
up
to
the
head
of
the
pass
and
then
through
the
groves
and
between
the
temples
and
colleges
and
houses
which
stood
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
sacred
mountain
till
i
reached
that
boundary
beyond
which
in
milder
days
it
was
death
for
any
but
the
privileged
few
to
pass
but
the
time
it
appeared
to
me
was
past
for
conventions
and
moreover
my
own
temper
was
hot
and
it
is
likely
that
i
should
have
strode
on
with
little
scruple
if
i
had
not
been
interrupted
but
in
the
temple
which
marked
the
boundary
there
was
old
zaemon
waiting
and
he
with
due
solemnity
of
words
and
with
the
whole
of
some
ancient
ritual
ordained
for
that
purpose
sought
dispensation
from
the
high
gods
for
my
trespass
and
would
not
give
me
way
till
he
was
through
with
his
ceremony
already
phorenice
s
tower
and
bridge
were
in
position
for
the
clash
and
yelling
of
a
fight
told
that
the
small
handful
of
priests
on
the
rampart
of
the
last
gate
were
bartering
their
lives
for
the
highest
return
in
dead
that
they
could
earn
they
were
trained
fighting
men
all
but
old
and
feeble
and
the
odds
against
them
were
too
enormous
to
be
stemmed
for
over
long
in
a
very
short
time
the
place
would
be
put
to
the
storm
and
the
roof
of
the
sacred
mountain
would
be
at
the
open
mercy
of
the
invader
if
there
was
any
further
thing
to
be
done
it
was
well
that
it
should
be
set
about
quickly
whilst
peace
remained
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
moment
for
prompt
action
and
the
time
for
lengthy
pompous
ceremonial
was
done
for
good
but
zaemon
was
minded
otherwise
he
led
me
up
to
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
and
chided
my
impatience
and
waited
till
i
had
given
it
my
reverential
kiss
and
then
he
called
aloud
and
another
old
man
came
out
of
the
opening
which
is
in
the
top
of
the
ark
and
climbed
painfully
down
by
the
battens
which
are
fixed
on
its
sides
he
was
a
man
i
had
never
seen
before
hoary
frail
and
emaciated
and
he
and
zaemon
were
then
the
only
two
remaining
priests
who
had
been
raised
to
the
highest
degree
known
to
our
clan
and
who
alone
had
knowledge
of
the
highest
secrets
and
powers
and
mysteries
look
cried
zaemon
in
his
shrill
old
voice
and
swept
a
trembling
finger
over
the
shattered
city
and
the
great
spread
of
sea
and
country
which
lay
in
view
of
us
below
i
followed
his
pointing
and
looked
and
a
chill
began
to
crawl
through
me
all
was
plainly
shown
our
lord
the
sun
burned
high
overhead
in
a
sky
of
cloudless
blue
and
day
shimmered
in
his
heat
all
below
seemed
from
that
distance
peaceful
and
warm
and
still
save
only
that
the
mountains
smoked
more
than
ordinary
and
some
spouted
fires
and
that
the
sea
boiled
with
some
strange
disorder
but
it
was
the
significance
of
the
sea
that
troubled
me
most
far
out
on
the
distant
coast
it
surged
against
the
rocks
in
enormous
rolls
of
surf
and
up
the
great
estuary
at
the
head
of
which
the
city
of
atlantis
stands
it
gushed
in
successive
waves
of
enormous
height
which
never
returned
already
the
lower
lands
on
either
side
were
blotted
out
beneath
tumultuous
waters
the
harbour
walls
were
drowned
out
of
sight
and
the
flood
was
creeping
up
into
the
lower
wards
of
the
great
city
itself
you
have
seen
asked
zaemon
i
have
you
understand
in
then
let
me
tell
you
all
this
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
will
follow
swiftly
the
most
high
gods
that
sit
behind
the
stars
have
a
limit
to
even
their
sublime
patience
and
that
has
been
passed
the
city
of
atlantis
the
great
continent
that
is
beyond
and
all
that
are
in
them
are
doomed
to
unutterable
destruction
of
old
it
was
foreseen
that
this
great
would
happen
through
the
sins
of
men
and
to
this
end
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
was
built
under
the
direction
of
the
gods
no
mortal
implements
can
so
much
as
scratch
its
surface
no
waves
or
rocks
wreck
it
inside
is
stored
on
sheets
of
the
ancient
writing
all
that
is
known
in
the
world
of
learning
that
is
not
shared
by
the
common
people
also
there
is
grain
in
a
store
and
sweet
water
in
tanks
sufficient
for
two
persons
for
the
space
of
four
years
together
with
seeds
weapons
and
all
such
other
matters
as
were
deemed
fit
out
of
all
this
vast
country
it
has
been
decreed
by
the
high
gods
that
two
shall
not
perish
two
shall
be
chosen
a
man
and
a
woman
who
are
fit
and
proper
persons
to
carry
away
with
them
the
ancient
learning
to
dispose
of
it
as
they
see
best
and
afterwards
to
rear
up
a
race
who
shall
in
time
build
another
kingdom
and
do
honour
to
our
lord
the
sun
and
the
other
gods
in
another
place
the
woman
is
within
the
ark
already
and
seated
in
the
place
appointed
for
her
and
though
she
is
a
daughter
of
mine
the
burden
of
her
choosing
is
with
you
for
the
man
the
choice
has
fallen
upon
i
was
half
numb
with
the
shock
of
what
was
befalling
i
do
not
know
that
i
care
to
be
a
you
are
not
asked
for
your
wishes
said
the
old
man
you
are
given
an
order
from
the
high
gods
who
know
you
to
be
their
faithful
habit
rode
strong
upon
me
i
made
salutation
in
the
required
form
and
said
that
i
heard
and
would
obey
then
it
remains
to
raise
you
to
the
sublime
degree
of
the
three
and
if
your
learning
is
so
small
that
you
will
not
understand
the
keys
to
many
of
the
powers
and
the
highest
of
the
mysteries
when
they
are
handed
to
you
that
fault
can
not
be
remedied
certainly
the
time
remaining
was
short
enough
the
fight
still
raged
down
at
the
gate
in
the
pass
though
it
was
a
wonder
how
the
handful
of
priests
had
held
their
ground
so
long
but
the
ocean
rolled
in
upon
the
land
in
an
flood
and
the
mountains
smoked
and
belched
forth
more
volleys
of
rock
as
the
weight
increased
on
their
lower
parts
and
presently
those
that
besieged
the
mountain
could
not
fail
to
see
the
fate
that
threatened
them
then
there
would
be
no
withholding
their
rush
in
their
mad
fury
and
panic
they
would
sweep
all
obstruction
resistlessly
before
them
and
those
who
stood
in
their
path
might
look
to
themselves
but
there
was
no
hurrying
zaemon
and
his
fellow
sage
they
were
without
temple
for
the
ceremony
without
sacrifice
or
incense
to
decorate
it
they
had
but
the
sky
for
a
roof
to
make
their
echoes
and
the
gods
themselves
for
witnesses
but
they
went
through
the
work
of
raising
me
to
their
own
degree
with
all
the
grand
and
majestic
form
which
has
gathered
dignity
from
the
ages
and
by
no
one
sentence
did
they
curtail
it
a
burning
mountain
burst
with
a
bellowing
roar
as
the
incoming
waters
met
its
fires
but
gravely
they
went
on
in
turn
reciting
their
sentences
phorenice
s
troops
broke
down
the
last
resistance
and
poured
in
a
frenzied
stream
amongst
the
groves
and
temples
but
still
they
quavered
never
in
the
ritual
it
had
been
said
that
this
ceremony
is
the
grandest
and
the
most
impressive
of
all
those
connected
with
our
holy
religion
and
certainly
i
found
it
so
and
i
speak
as
one
intimate
with
all
the
others
even
the
tremendous
circumstances
which
hemmed
them
in
could
do
nothing
to
make
these
frail
old
men
forget
the
deference
which
was
due
to
the
highest
order
of
the
clan
for
myself
i
will
freely
own
i
was
less
rapt
i
stood
there
bareheaded
in
the
heat
a
man
trying
to
concentrate
himself
and
yet
torn
the
while
by
a
thousand
foreign
emotions
the
awful
thing
that
was
happening
all
around
compelled
some
of
my
attention
a
continent
was
in
the
very
act
and
article
of
meeting
with
complete
destruction
and
if
zaemon
and
the
other
priest
were
strong
enough
to
give
their
minds
wholly
up
to
a
matter
parochial
to
the
priesthood
i
was
not
so
stoical
and
moreover
i
was
filled
with
other
anxieties
and
thoughts
concerning
nais
yet
i
managed
to
preserve
a
decent
show
of
attention
to
the
ceremony
making
all
those
responses
which
were
required
of
me
and
trying
as
well
as
might
be
to
preserve
in
my
mind
those
sentences
which
were
the
keys
to
power
and
learning
and
not
mere
phrasings
of
grandeur
and
devotion
but
it
became
clear
that
if
the
ceremony
of
my
raising
did
not
soon
arrive
at
its
natural
end
it
would
be
cut
short
presently
with
something
of
suddenness
phorenice
s
conquering
legions
swarmed
out
on
to
the
crest
of
the
mountain
and
now
carried
full
knowledge
of
the
dreadful
thing
that
was
come
upon
the
country
they
were
out
of
all
control
and
ran
about
like
men
distracted
but
knowing
full
well
that
the
priests
would
have
brought
this
terrible
wreck
to
pass
by
virtue
of
the
powers
which
were
stored
within
the
ark
of
the
mysteries
it
would
be
their
natural
impulse
to
pour
out
a
final
vengeance
upon
any
of
these
same
priests
they
could
come
across
before
it
was
too
late
it
began
to
come
to
my
mind
that
if
the
ceremony
did
not
very
shortly
terminate
the
further
part
of
the
plan
would
stand
very
small
chance
of
completion
and
i
should
come
by
my
death
after
all
by
fighting
to
a
finish
as
i
had
pictured
to
myself
before
my
flickering
attention
saw
the
soldiers
coming
always
nearer
in
their
frantic
wanderings
and
saw
also
the
sea
below
rolling
deeper
and
deeper
in
upon
the
land
the
fires
too
which
ringed
in
half
the
mountain
spurted
up
to
double
their
old
height
and
burned
with
an
unceasing
roar
but
for
all
distraction
these
things
gave
to
the
two
old
priests
who
were
raising
me
we
might
have
been
in
the
quietness
of
some
ancient
temple
with
no
so
much
as
a
fly
to
buzz
an
interruption
but
at
last
an
end
came
to
the
ceremony
kneel
cried
zaemon
and
make
obeisance
to
your
mother
the
earth
and
swear
by
the
high
gods
that
you
will
never
make
improper
use
of
the
powers
over
her
which
this
day
you
have
been
when
i
had
done
that
he
bade
me
rise
as
a
fully
installed
and
duly
initiated
member
of
the
three
you
will
have
no
opportunity
to
practise
the
workings
of
this
degree
with
either
of
us
my
brother
said
he
for
presently
our
other
brother
and
i
go
to
stand
before
the
gods
to
deliver
to
them
an
account
of
our
trust
and
of
how
we
have
carried
it
out
but
what
items
you
remember
here
and
there
may
turn
of
use
to
you
hereafter
and
now
we
two
give
you
our
farewells
and
promise
to
commend
you
highly
to
the
gods
when
soon
we
meet
them
in
their
place
behind
the
stars
climb
now
into
the
ark
and
be
ready
to
shut
the
door
which
guards
it
if
there
is
any
attempt
by
these
raging
people
to
invade
that
also
remember
my
brother
it
is
the
gods
direct
will
that
you
and
the
woman
nais
go
from
this
place
living
and
sound
and
you
are
expressly
forbidden
to
accept
challenge
or
provocation
to
fight
on
any
pretext
whatever
but
as
long
as
may
be
done
in
safety
you
may
look
out
upon
atlantis
in
her
it
is
very
fitting
that
one
of
the
only
two
who
are
sent
hence
alive
should
carry
the
full
tale
of
what
has
i
went
to
the
top
of
the
ark
of
mysteries
then
climbing
there
by
the
battens
which
are
fastened
to
the
sides
and
then
descended
by
the
stair
which
is
inside
and
found
nais
in
a
little
chamber
waiting
for
me
i
was
bidden
stay
here
by
zaemon
she
said
who
forced
me
to
this
place
by
threats
and
also
by
promises
that
my
lord
would
follow
he
is
very
ungentle
that
father
of
mine
but
i
think
he
has
a
kindness
for
us
both
and
any
way
he
is
my
father
and
i
can
not
help
loving
him
is
there
no
chance
to
save
him
from
what
is
going
to
happen
he
will
not
come
into
this
ark
for
i
asked
him
it
has
been
ordained
from
the
ancient
time
when
first
the
ark
was
built
that
when
the
day
for
its
purpose
came
one
woman
and
one
man
should
be
its
only
tenants
and
they
are
here
already
zaemon
s
will
in
the
matter
is
not
to
be
twisted
by
you
or
by
me
he
has
a
message
to
be
delivered
to
the
gods
and
if
i
know
him
at
all
he
grudges
every
minute
that
is
lost
in
carrying
it
to
i
left
her
then
and
went
out
again
up
the
stair
and
stood
once
more
on
the
roof
of
the
ark
on
the
mountain
top
men
still
ran
about
distracted
but
gradually
they
were
coming
to
where
the
ark
rested
on
the
highest
point
for
the
moment
however
i
passed
them
lightly
the
drowning
of
the
great
continent
that
had
been
spread
out
below
filled
the
eye
ocean
roared
in
upon
it
with
still
more
furious
waves
the
plains
and
the
level
lands
were
foaming
lakes
the
great
city
of
atlantis
had
vanished
eternally
the
mountains
alone
kept
their
heads
above
the
flood
and
spewed
out
rocks
and
steam
and
boiling
stone
or
burst
when
the
waters
reached
them
and
created
great
whirlpools
of
surging
sea
and
twisted
trees
and
bubbling
mud
in
the
space
of
a
few
breaths
every
living
creature
that
dwelt
in
the
lower
grounds
had
been
smothered
by
the
waters
save
for
a
few
who
huddled
in
a
pair
of
galleys
that
were
driven
oarless
inland
over
what
had
once
been
black
forest
and
hunting
land
for
the
beasts
and
even
as
i
watched
these
also
were
swallowed
up
by
the
horrid
turmoil
of
sea
and
nothing
but
the
sea
beasts
and
those
of
the
greater
lizards
which
can
live
in
such
outrageous
waters
could
have
survived
even
that
state
of
the
destruction
indeed
none
but
those
men
who
had
now
found
on
the
upper
slopes
of
the
sacred
mountain
survived
and
it
was
plain
that
their
span
was
short
for
the
great
mass
of
the
continent
sank
deeper
and
more
deep
every
minute
before
our
aching
eyes
beneath
the
boiling
inrush
of
the
seas
but
though
the
great
mass
of
the
soldiery
were
dazed
and
maddened
at
the
prospect
of
the
overwhelming
which
threatened
them
there
were
some
with
a
strength
of
mind
too
valiant
to
give
any
outward
show
of
discomposure
presently
a
compact
little
body
of
people
came
from
out
the
houses
and
the
temples
and
headed
directly
across
the
open
ground
towards
the
ark
on
the
outside
marched
phorenice
s
personal
guards
with
their
weapons
new
blooded
they
had
been
forced
to
fight
a
way
through
their
own
fellow
soldiers
the
poor
demented
creatures
had
thought
it
was
every
one
for
himself
now
till
these
guards
by
their
mistress
s
order
proved
to
them
that
phorenice
still
came
first
and
in
the
middle
of
them
borne
in
a
litter
of
gold
and
ivory
by
her
grotesque
european
slaves
rode
the
empress
still
calm
still
lovely
and
seemingly
divided
in
her
sentiments
between
contempt
and
amusement
her
two
children
lay
in
the
litter
at
her
feet
on
her
right
hand
marched
tatho
gorgeously
apparelled
and
with
a
beard
curled
and
plaited
into
a
thousand
ringlets
on
the
other
side
plying
her
industry
with
unruffled
defence
walked
ylga
once
again
and
so
still
second
lady
in
this
dwindling
kingdom
the
party
of
them
halted
half
a
score
of
paces
from
the
ark
by
phorenice
s
order
do
not
go
nearer
to
those
unclean
old
men
they
carry
a
rank
odour
with
them
and
for
the
moment
we
are
short
of
essences
to
sweeten
the
air
of
their
she
lifted
her
eyebrows
and
looked
up
at
me
truly
a
quiet
little
gathering
of
old
acquaintances
why
there
is
deucalion
that
once
i
took
the
flavour
of
and
threw
aside
when
he
cloyed
i
have
nais
here
i
said
and
presently
we
two
will
be
all
that
are
left
alive
of
this
nais
is
quite
welcome
to
my
leavings
she
laughed
i
will
look
down
upon
your
country
cooings
when
presently
i
go
back
to
the
place
behind
the
stars
from
which
i
came
you
are
a
very
rustic
person
deucalion
they
tell
me
too
that
three
or
four
of
these
smelling
old
men
up
here
have
named
you
king
did
you
swell
much
with
dignity
or
did
you
remember
that
there
was
a
pretty
empress
left
that
would
still
be
empress
so
long
as
there
was
an
atlantis
to
govern
come
sir
find
your
tongue
by
my
face
you
must
have
hungered
for
me
very
madly
these
years
we
have
been
parted
if
ruggedness
of
feature
is
an
have
your
gibe
i
do
not
gibe
back
at
a
woman
who
presently
will
bah
deucalion
you
will
live
behind
the
times
have
they
not
told
you
that
i
know
the
great
secret
and
am
indeed
a
goddess
now
my
arts
can
make
life
run
on
then
the
waters
will
presently
test
them
hard
i
said
but
there
the
talk
was
taken
into
other
lips
zaemon
went
forward
to
the
front
of
the
litter
with
the
symbol
of
our
lord
the
sun
glowing
in
his
hand
and
burst
into
a
flow
of
cursing
it
was
hard
for
me
to
hear
his
words
the
roar
of
the
waters
which
poured
up
over
the
land
and
beat
in
vast
waves
against
the
sacred
mountain
itself
grew
nearer
and
more
loud
but
the
old
man
had
his
say
phorenice
gave
orders
to
her
guards
for
his
killing
yes
tried
even
to
rise
from
the
litter
and
do
the
work
herself
but
zaemon
held
the
symbol
to
his
front
and
its
power
in
that
supreme
moment
mastered
all
the
arts
that
could
be
brought
against
it
the
majesty
of
the
most
high
gods
was
vindicated
and
that
splendid
empress
knew
it
and
lay
back
sullenly
amongst
the
cushions
of
her
litter
a
beaten
woman
only
one
person
in
that
rigid
knot
of
people
found
power
to
leave
the
rest
and
that
was
ylga
she
came
out
to
the
side
of
the
ark
and
leaned
up
and
cried
me
a
farewell
through
the
gathering
roar
of
the
flood
i
would
i
might
save
you
and
take
you
with
us
i
said
as
for
that
she
said
with
a
gesture
i
would
not
come
if
you
asked
me
i
am
not
a
woman
that
will
take
anything
less
than
all
but
i
shall
meet
what
comes
presently
with
the
memory
that
you
will
have
me
always
somewhere
in
your
recollection
i
know
somewhat
of
men
even
men
of
your
stamp
deucalion
and
you
will
never
forget
that
you
came
very
near
to
loving
me
i
think
too
she
said
something
further
concerning
nais
but
the
bellowing
rush
of
the
waters
drowned
all
other
words
a
great
mist
made
from
the
stream
sent
up
by
the
swamped
burning
mountains
stopped
all
accurate
view
though
the
blaze
from
the
fires
lit
it
like
gold
but
i
had
a
last
sight
of
a
horde
of
soldiery
rushing
up
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
with
a
scum
of
surge
billowing
at
their
heels
and
licking
many
of
them
back
in
its
clutch
and
then
my
eye
fell
on
old
zaemon
waving
to
me
with
the
symbol
to
shut
down
the
door
in
the
roof
of
the
ark
i
obeyed
his
last
command
and
went
down
the
stair
and
closed
all
ingress
behind
me
there
were
bolts
placed
ready
and
i
shot
these
into
their
sockets
and
there
were
nais
and
i
alone
and
cut
off
from
all
the
rest
of
our
world
that
remained
i
went
to
the
place
where
she
lay
and
put
my
arms
tightly
around
her
without
we
heard
men
beating
desperately
on
the
ark
with
their
weapons
and
some
even
climbed
by
the
battens
to
the
top
and
wrenched
to
try
and
move
the
door
from
its
fastenings
the
end
was
coming
very
nearly
to
them
now
and
the
great
crowd
of
them
were
mad
with
terror
i
would
have
given
much
to
have
known
how
phorenice
fared
in
that
final
tumult
and
how
she
faced
it
i
could
see
her
with
her
lovely
face
and
her
wondrous
eyes
and
her
ruddy
hair
curling
about
her
neck
and
by
all
the
gods
i
thought
more
of
her
at
that
last
moment
than
of
the
poor
land
she
had
conquered
and
misgoverned
and
brought
to
this
horrid
destruction
there
is
no
denying
the
fascination
which
phorenice
carried
with
her
but
the
end
did
not
dally
long
with
its
coming
there
was
a
little
surge
that
lifted
the
ark
a
hand
s
breadth
or
so
in
its
cradle
and
set
it
back
again
with
a
jar
and
a
quiver
the
blows
from
axes
and
weapons
ceased
on
its
lower
part
but
redoubled
into
frenzied
batterings
on
its
rounded
roof
there
were
some
screams
and
cries
also
which
came
to
us
but
dully
through
the
thickness
of
its
ponderous
sheathing
though
likely
enough
they
were
sent
forth
at
the
full
pitch
of
human
lungs
outside
and
when
another
surge
came
roaring
and
thundering
which
picked
up
the
great
vessel
as
though
it
had
been
a
feather
and
spun
it
giddily
and
after
that
we
touched
earth
or
rock
no
more
we
tossed
about
on
the
crest
and
troughs
of
delirious
seas
a
sport
for
the
greedy
gods
of
the
ocean
the
lamp
had
fallen
and
we
crouched
there
in
darkness
dully
weighed
with
the
burden
of
knowledge
that
we
alone
were
saved
out
of
what
was
yesterday
a
mighty
nation
on
the
bosom
of
the
deep
the
ark
was
rudderless
oarless
and
machineless
and
could
travel
only
where
the
high
gods
chose
the
inside
was
dark
and
full
of
an
ancient
smell
and
crowded
with
groanings
and
noise
i
could
not
find
the
to
relight
the
fallen
lamp
and
so
we
had
to
endure
blindly
what
was
dealt
out
to
us
the
waves
tossed
us
in
merciless
sport
and
i
clung
on
by
the
side
of
nais
holding
her
to
the
bed
we
did
not
speak
much
but
there
was
full
companionship
in
our
bereavement
and
our
silence
when
atlantis
sank
to
form
new
ocean
bed
she
left
great
whirlpools
and
spoutings
from
her
drowned
fires
as
a
fleeting
legacy
to
the
gods
of
the
sea
and
then
i
think
though
in
the
black
belly
of
the
ark
we
could
not
see
these
things
a
vast
hurricane
of
wind
must
have
come
on
next
so
as
to
leave
no
piece
of
the
desolation
incomplete
for
seven
nights
and
seven
days
did
this
dreadful
turmoil
continue
as
counted
for
us
afterwards
by
the
reckoner
of
hours
which
hung
within
the
ark
and
then
the
howling
of
the
wind
departed
and
only
the
roll
of
a
long
still
swell
remained
it
was
regular
and
it
was
oily
as
i
could
tell
by
the
difference
of
the
motion
and
then
for
the
first
time
i
dared
to
go
up
the
stair
and
open
the
door
which
stood
in
the
roof
of
the
ark
the
sweet
air
came
gushing
down
to
freshen
the
foulness
within
and
as
the
ark
rode
dryly
over
the
seas
i
went
below
and
brought
up
nais
to
gain
refreshment
from
the
curing
rays
of
our
lord
the
sun
duly
the
pair
of
us
adored
him
and
gave
thanks
for
his
great
mercy
in
coming
to
light
another
day
and
then
we
laid
ourselves
down
where
we
were
to
doze
and
take
that
easy
rest
which
we
so
urgently
needed
yet
though
i
was
tired
beyond
words
for
long
enough
sleep
would
not
visit
me
wearily
i
stared
out
over
the
oily
sunlit
waters
no
blur
of
land
met
the
eye
the
ring
of
ocean
was
unbroken
on
every
side
and
overhead
the
vault
of
heaven
remained
unchanged
the
bosom
of
the
deep
was
littered
with
the
poor
wreckage
of
atlantis
to
remind
one
if
there
had
been
a
need
that
what
had
come
about
was
fact
and
not
some
horrid
dream
trees
squared
timber
a
smashed
and
upturned
boat
of
hides
and
here
and
there
the
rounded
corpse
of
a
man
or
beast
shouldered
over
the
swells
and
kept
convoy
with
our
ark
as
she
drifted
on
in
charge
of
the
gods
and
the
current
but
sleep
came
to
me
at
last
and
i
dropped
off
into
unconsciousness
holding
the
hand
of
nais
in
mine
and
when
next
i
woke
i
found
her
also
and
watching
me
tenderly
we
were
finely
rested
both
of
us
and
rest
and
strength
bring
one
complacency
we
were
more
ready
now
to
accept
the
station
which
the
high
gods
had
made
for
us
without
repining
and
so
we
went
below
again
into
the
belly
of
the
ark
to
eat
and
drink
and
maintain
strength
for
the
new
life
which
lay
before
us
a
wonderful
vessel
was
this
ark
now
we
were
able
to
see
it
at
leisure
and
intimately
although
for
the
first
time
now
in
all
its
centuries
of
life
it
swam
upon
the
waters
it
showed
no
leak
or
suncrack
inside
even
its
floor
was
bone
dry
that
it
was
built
from
some
wood
one
could
see
by
the
grainings
but
nowhere
could
one
find
suture
or
joint
the
living
timbers
had
been
put
in
place
and
then
grown
together
by
an
art
which
we
have
lost
but
which
the
ancients
knew
with
much
perfection
and
afterwards
some
treatment
which
is
also
a
secret
of
those
forgotten
builders
had
made
the
wood
as
hard
as
metal
and
impervious
to
all
attacks
of
the
weather
in
the
gloomy
cave
of
its
belly
were
stored
many
matters
at
one
end
in
great
tanks
on
either
side
of
central
alley
was
a
prodigious
store
of
grain
sweet
water
was
in
other
tanks
at
the
other
end
in
another
place
were
drugs
and
samples
and
essences
of
the
life
of
beasts
all
these
things
being
for
use
whilst
the
ark
roamed
under
the
guidance
of
the
gods
on
the
bosom
of
the
deep
on
all
the
walls
of
the
ark
and
on
all
the
partitions
of
the
tanks
and
the
other
woodwork
there
were
carved
in
the
rude
art
of
bygone
time
representations
of
all
the
beasts
which
lived
in
atlantis
and
on
these
i
looked
with
a
hunter
s
interest
as
some
of
them
were
strange
to
me
and
had
died
out
with
the
men
who
had
perpetuated
them
in
these
sculptures
there
was
a
good
store
of
weapons
too
and
the
tools
for
handicrafts
now
for
many
weeks
our
life
endured
in
this
ark
as
the
gods
drove
it
about
here
and
there
across
the
face
of
the
waters
we
had
no
government
over
direction
we
could
not
by
so
much
as
a
hair
s
breadth
a
day
increase
her
speed
the
high
gods
that
had
chosen
the
two
of
us
to
be
the
only
ones
saved
out
of
all
atlantis
had
sole
control
of
our
fate
and
into
their
hands
we
cheerfully
resigned
our
future
direction
of
that
land
which
we
reached
in
due
time
and
where
we
made
our
abiding
place
and
where
our
children
were
born
i
shall
tell
of
in
its
place
but
since
this
chronicle
has
proceeded
so
far
in
an
exact
order
of
the
events
as
they
came
to
pass
it
is
necessary
first
to
narrate
how
we
came
by
the
sheets
on
which
it
is
written
in
a
great
coffer
in
the
centre
of
the
ark
s
floor
the
whole
of
the
mysteries
learned
during
the
study
of
ages
were
set
down
in
accurate
writing
i
read
through
some
of
them
during
the
days
which
passed
and
the
awfulness
of
the
powers
over
which
they
gave
control
appalled
me
i
had
seen
some
of
these
powers
set
loose
in
atlantis
and
was
a
witness
of
her
destruction
but
here
were
powers
far
higher
than
those
here
was
the
great
secret
of
life
and
death
which
phorenice
also
had
found
and
for
which
she
had
been
destroyed
and
there
were
other
things
also
of
which
i
can
not
even
bring
my
stylo
to
scribe
the
thought
of
being
custodian
of
these
writings
was
more
than
i
could
endure
and
the
more
the
matter
rested
in
my
mind
the
more
intolerable
became
the
burden
and
at
last
i
took
hot
irons
and
with
them

letter

obliterated
if
i
did

the

gods
in

it
