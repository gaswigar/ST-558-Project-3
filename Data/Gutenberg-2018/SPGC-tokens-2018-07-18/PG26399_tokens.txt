fairy
prince
the
game
of
the
the
blinded
lady
the
gift
of
the
probable
places
the
book
of
the
funny
smells
and
everything
the
little
dog
who
could
sleep
fairy
prince
in
my
father
house
were
many
fancies
always
for
instance
on
every
thanksgiving
day
it
was
the
custom
in
our
family
to
the
christmas
tree
young
derry
willard
came
from
cuba
his
father
and
our
father
had
been
chums
together
at
college
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
him
before
we
were
very
much
excited
to
have
a
strange
young
man
invited
for
thanksgiving
dinner
my
sister
rosalee
was
seventeen
my
brother
carol
was
eleven
i
myself
was
only
nine
but
with
very
tall
legs
young
derry
willard
was
certainly
excited
when
he
saw
the
christmas
tree
excited
enough
i
mean
to
shift
his
eyes
for
at
least
three
minutes
from
my
sister
rosalee
face
lovely
as
my
sister
rosalee
was
it
had
never
yet
occurred
to
any
of
us
i
think
until
just
that
moment
that
she
was
old
enough
to
have
perfectly
strange
young
men
stare
at
her
so
hard
it
made
my
father
rather
nervous
he
cut
his
hand
on
the
nothing
ever
made
my
mother
nervous
except
for
father
cutting
his
hand
it
seemed
to
be
a
very
nourishing
dinner
the
tomato
soup
was
pink
with
cream
the
roast
turkey
look
a
single
sad
bit
like
any
one
you
seen
before
there
was
plenty
of
egg
with
the
spinach
the
baked
potatoes
were
frosted
with
red
pepper
there
was
mince
pie
there
was
apple
pie
there
was
pumpkin
pie
there
were
nuts
and
raisins
there
were
gay
bonbons
and
everywhere
all
through
the
house
the
funny
blunt
smell
of
black
coffee
it
was
my
brother
carol
duty
always
to
bring
in
the
christmas
tree
by
some
strange
of
what
is
and
what
is
my
brother
carol
was
dumb
stark
dumb
i
mean
and
from
birth
but
tho
he
had
never
found
his
voice
he
had
at
least
never
lost
his
shining
face
even
now
at
eleven
in
the
twilightly
end
of
a
rainy
sunday
or
most
any
day
when
he
had
an
earache
he
still
let
mother
call
him
shining
face
but
if
any
children
called
him
shining
face
he
kicked
them
even
when
he
kicked
people
tho
he
could
stop
his
face
shining
it
was
very
cheerful
everything
about
carol
was
very
cheerful
no
matter
indeed
how
much
we
might
play
and
whisper
about
gifts
and
tinsels
and
candles
christmas
never
i
think
seemed
really
to
any
of
us
until
that
one
jumpy
moment
just
at
the
end
of
the
thanksgiving
dinner
when
heralded
by
a
slam
in
the
a
hoppytyskip
in
the
hall
the
door
flung
widely
open
on
carol
eyes
twinkling
like
a
whole
skyful
of
stars
through
the
shaggy
dark
branches
of
a
young
it
made
young
derry
willard
laugh
right
out
loud
why
of
all
funny
things
he
said
on
thanksgiving
day
why
it
looks
like
a
christmas
tree
it
is
a
christmas
tree
explained
my
sister
rosalee
very
patiently
my
sister
rosalee
was
almost
always
very
patient
but
i
had
never
seen
her
patient
with
a
young
man
before
it
made
her
cheeks
very
pink
it
a
christmas
tree
she
explained
that
is
it
going
to
be
a
christmas
tree
just
the
very
first
second
we
get
it
it
start
right
in
to
be
a
christmas
tree
puzzled
young
derry
willard
really
for
a
person
who
looked
so
much
like
the
picture
of
the
fairy
prince
in
my
best
he
seemed
just
a
little
bit
slow
why
of
course
it
got
to
be
i
cried
that
what
for
that
instead
of
just
being
pink
patient
my
sister
rosalee
started
in
suddenly
to
be
dimply
patient
too
it
from
mother
garden
you
know
she
went
right
on
explaining
mother
got
a
winter
garden
a
garden
father
got
a
garden
too
i
maintained
stoutly
father
is
a
spring
garden
reds
blues
yellows
greens
whites
from
france
and
holland
and
california
and
asia
minor
tulips
you
know
oh
father
garden
is
a
i
boasted
and
mother
garden
said
my
mother
very
softly
is
only
a
story
it
an
awfully
nice
story
said
rosalee
young
derry
willard
seemed
to
like
stories
tell
it
he
begged
it
was
rosalee
who
told
it
why
it
was
when
carol
was
born
she
said
it
was
on
a
christmas
eve
you
know
that
why
mother
named
him
carol
we
did
know
then
you
see
interrupted
my
mother
very
softly
that
carol
had
been
given
the
gift
of
silence
rather
than
the
gift
of
speech
and
father
was
so
happy
to
have
a
boy
dimpled
rosalee
that
he
said
to
mother
now
i
guess
you
got
everything
in
the
world
that
you
want
and
mother
said
except
a
spruce
forest
so
father
bought
her
a
spruce
forest
said
rosalee
that
the
story
oh
my
dear
laughed
my
mother
that
is
a
at
all
all
you
told
is
the
facts
it
the
of
the
facts
that
makes
a
story
you
know
it
was
on
my
birthday
glowed
mother
that
the
presentation
was
to
be
made
my
birthday
was
in
march
i
was
very
much
excited
and
came
down
to
breakfast
with
my
hat
and
coat
on
are
you
going
said
my
husband
oh
mother
protested
rosalee
away
was
what
you
always
told
us
he
said
away
of
course
what
he
said
laughed
my
mother
i
going
to
find
my
spruce
forest
i
told
him
i
wait
a
moment
longer
is
it
the
big
one
over
beyond
the
mountain
i
implored
him
the
little
grove
that
the
deacon
tried
to
sell
you
last
year
and
they
never
budged
an
inch
from
the
house
interrupted
rosalee
it
was
the
funniest
over
in
the
corner
of
the
room
my
father
laughed
out
suddenly
my
father
had
left
the
table
he
and
carol
were
trying
very
hard
to
make
the
stand
upright
in
a
huge
pot
of
wet
earth
the
did
want
to
stand
upright
my
father
laughed
all
over
again
but
it
was
at
the
well
now
would
it
have
been
a
pity
he
said
to
have
made
a
perfectly
good
lady
fare
forth
on
a
cold
march
morning
to
find
her
own
birthday
present
my
mother
began
to
clap
her
hands
it
was
a
very
little
noise
but
jolly
it
came
by
mail
she
cried
my
whole
spruce
forest
in
a
package
no
bigger
than
my
head
than
your
rather
fluffy
head
corrected
my
father
three
hundred
spruce
seedlings
cried
my
mother
each
one
no
bigger
than
a
wisp
of
grass
like
little
green
ferns
they
were
so
tender
so
fluffing
so
helpless
said
young
derry
willard
well
i
guess
you
laughed
then
when
people
are
trying
to
remember
things
outside
themselves
i
noticed
they
always
open
their
eyes
very
wide
but
when
they
are
remembering
things
inside
themselves
they
shut
their
eyes
very
tight
my
mother
shut
her
eyes
very
tight
no
i
did
exactly
laugh
said
my
mother
and
i
did
exactly
cry
you
would
eat
cried
rosalee
not
all
day
i
mean
father
had
to
feed
you
with
a
spoon
it
was
in
the
you
held
the
box
on
your
knees
you
just
shone
and
shone
and
it
would
have
been
pretty
hard
said
my
mother
not
to
have
shone
a
little
to
brood
a
baby
forest
in
one
arms
if
only
for
a
single
day
think
of
the
experience
even
at
the
very
thought
of
it
she
began
to
all
over
again
funny
little
fluff
o
green
she
laughed
no
fatter
than
a
fern
her
voice
went
suddenly
all
wabbly
like
a
preacher
but
oh
the
glory
of
it
she
said
the
potential
majesty
great
sweeping
branches
nests
for
birds
shade
for
lovers
masts
for
ships
to
plow
the
great
world
waters
timbers
perhaps
for
cathedrals
o
h
shivered
my
mother
it
certainly
gave
one
a
very
queer
feeling
no
woman
surely
in
the
whole
wide
world
except
the
mother
of
the
little
christ
ever
felt
so
astonished
to
think
what
she
had
in
her
lap
young
derry
willard
looked
just
a
little
bit
nervous
oh
but
of
course
mother
could
begin
all
at
once
to
raise
cathedrals
i
hastened
to
explain
so
she
started
in
raising
christmas
presents
instead
we
raise
all
our
own
christmas
presents
and
just
as
soon
as
rosalee
and
i
are
married
we
going
to
begin
right
away
to
raise
our
children
christmas
presents
too
heaps
for
everybody
even
if
there
is
a
hundred
carol
of
course
wo
marry
because
he
propose
ladies
do
like
written
proposals
father
says
ladies
young
derry
willard
asked
if
he
might
smoke
he
smoked
cigarets
he
took
them
from
a
case
they
smelled
very
romantic
everything
about
him
smelled
very
romantic
his
hair
was
black
his
eyes
were
black
he
looked
as
tho
he
could
cut
your
throat
without
flinching
if
you
were
faithless
to
him
it
was
beautiful
i
left
the
table
as
soon
as
i
could
i
went
and
got
my
best
i
was
perfectly
right
he
looked
like
the
picture
of
the
fairy
prince
on
the
front
page
of
the
book
there
were
heaps
of
other
pictures
of
course
but
only
one
picture
of
a
fairy
prince
i
looked
in
the
glass
i
looked
just
exactly
the
way
i
did
before
dinner
it
made
me
feel
queer
rosalee
did
look
at
all
the
way
she
looked
before
dinner
it
made
me
feel
queer
when
i
got
back
to
the
everybody
was
looking
at
the
little
except
young
derry
willard
and
rosalee
young
derry
willard
was
still
looking
at
rosalee
rosalee
was
looking
at
the
toes
of
her
slippers
the
fringe
of
her
eyelashes
seemed
to
be
an
inch
long
her
cheeks
were
so
pink
i
thought
she
had
a
fever
no
one
else
came
to
the
christmas
tree
except
carol
tame
coon
and
the
tame
crow
carol
is
very
unselfish
he
always
one
wish
for
the
coon
and
one
for
the
crow
the
tame
coon
looked
rather
jolly
and
in
the
firelight
the
crow
never
looked
jolly
i
have
heard
of
white
crows
but
carol
crow
was
a
very
dark
black
wherever
you
put
him
he
looked
like
a
sorrow
he
sat
on
the
arm
of
rosalee
chair
and
nibbed
at
her
pink
sleeve
young
derry
willard
pushed
him
away
young
derry
willard
and
rosalee
tried
to
whisper
i
heard
them
how
old
are
you
whispered
rosalee
i
whispered
young
derry
willard
o
h
said
rosalee
how
young
are
you
whispered
derry
willard
i
seventeen
whispered
rosalee
o
h
said
derry
willard
my
mother
started
in
very
suddenly
to
explain
about
the
christmas
tree
there
were
lots
of
little
pencils
on
the
table
and
blocks
of
paper
and
nice
cold
shining
sheets
of
there
was
and
and
green
and
blue
and
silver
and
gold
why
it
just
a
little
family
custom
of
ours
willard
explained
my
mother
after
the
thanksgiving
dinner
is
over
and
we
all
i
trust
feeling
reasonably
plump
and
contented
and
there
nothing
special
to
do
except
just
to
dream
and
think
why
we
just
list
out
the
various
things
that
we
for
christmas
and
most
people
end
thanksgiving
of
course
explained
my
father
by
trying
to
feel
thankful
for
the
things
they
already
had
but
this
seems
to
be
more
like
a
scheme
for
expressing
thanks
for
the
things
that
we
to
have
the
violet
is
rosalee
i
explained
the
green
is
mine
the
red
is
mother
the
blue
is
father
the
silver
is
carol
mother
takes
each
separate
just
as
soon
as
it
written
and
twists
it
all
up
in
a
bud
of
and
takes
wire
and
wires
the
bud
on
the
tree
gold
buds
silver
buds
red
green
everything
all
bursty
and
shining
like
spring
it
looks
as
tho
rainbows
had
rained
on
it
it
looks
as
tho
sun
and
moon
had
warmed
it
at
the
same
time
and
then
we
all
go
and
get
our
little
iron
banks
all
the
christmas
money
i
mean
that
we
been
saving
and
saving
for
a
whole
year
and
dump
it
all
out
round
the
base
of
the
tree
nickels
dimes
quarters
pennies
and
dump
them
all
out
round
the
base
of
the
tree
puzzled
young
derry
willard
carol
did
something
suddenly
that
i
never
saw
him
do
before
with
a
stranger
he
wrote
a
conversation
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
waved
it
at
young
derry
willard
it
was
a
short
conversation
but
it
was
written
very
tall
explained
carol
my
father
made
a
little
laugh
in
all
my
experience
with
horticulture
he
said
i
know
of
no
fertilizer
for
a
christmas
tree
that
equals
a
judicious
application
of
nickels
dimes
and
quarters
well
stirred
in
our
uncle
charlie
was
here
once
for
thanksgiving
i
cried
he
stirred
in
a
gold
piece
our
christmas
tree
bloomed
that
year
it
bloomed
tinsel
pompons
on
every
branch
and
it
bloomed
a
blackboard
for
carol
and
an
freezer
for
mother
and
and
then
we
take
the
tree
explained
my
mother
and
carry
it
into
the
parlor
and
shut
the
door
and
the
door
said
my
father
and
no
one
ever
sees
puzzled
young
derry
willard
what
was
written
in
the
wishes
i
said
rosalee
laughed
some
one
must
see
said
rosalee
just
about
a
week
before
christmas
father
and
mother
always
go
up
to
town
and
oh
of
course
mother
to
see
i
admitted
mother
is
such
friends
with
christmas
and
father
laughed
rosalee
is
such
friends
with
mother
usually
i
said
eh
said
father
and
then
explained
mother
on
christmas
morning
we
all
go
to
the
parlor
and
there
a
fire
in
the
parlor
i
explained
a
great
hollow
yule
log
all
stuffed
full
of
crackly
and
sputtering
sparkers
and
blazes
that
father
buys
at
a
fireworks
shop
and
the
candles
are
lighted
and
and
and
all
the
buds
have
bloomed
into
presents
laughed
derry
willard
oh
no
of
course
not
of
them
said
mother
no
tree
ever
fulfills
every
bud
said
my
father
there
carol
camel
of
course
laughed
rosalee
ever
since
carol
was
big
enough
to
wish
he
always
wished
for
a
camel
but
mostly
of
course
i
insisted
he
wishes
for
kites
he
got
nine
kites
last
christmas
kites
murmured
young
derry
willard
i
said
i
to
talk
a
good
deal
once
always
for
myself
and
all
over
again
for
carol
it
seemed
a
good
time
to
talk
for
carol
perhaps
a
person
who
came
all
the
way
from
cuba
could
tell
us
the
thing
we
wanted
to
know
oh
carol
very
much
interested
in
kites
i
confided
and
in
relationships
in
christmas
relationships
especially
when
he
grows
up
he
going
to
be
some
sort
of
a
jenny
something
i
think
it
an
ologist
or
else
keep
a
yes
murmured
young
derry
willard
there
are
two
ways
i
noticed
to
make
one
listen
to
you
one
is
to
shout
the
other
is
to
whisper
i
decided
to
whisper
you
do
seem
to
understand
i
whispered
it
christmas
relationships
that
are
worrying
carol
and
me
so
it
worries
us
dreadfully
oh
of
course
we
understand
all
about
the
little
baby
christ
and
the
camels
and
the
wise
men
and
the
frankincense
easy
but
is
santa
claus
unless
unless
it
was
carol
himself
who
signaled
me
to
go
on
unless
he
the
baby
i
thought
derry
willard
looked
a
little
bit
startled
carol
ears
turned
bright
red
oh
of
course
we
meant
on
his
side
i
hastened
to
assure
him
it
is
i
admit
a
new
idea
to
me
said
young
derry
willard
but
i
seem
to
have
gotten
several
new
ideas
he
looked
at
mother
mother
mouth
looked
very
funny
he
looked
at
father
father
seemed
to
be
sneezing
he
looked
at
rosalee
they
laughed
together
his
whole
face
suddenly
was
very
laughing
and
what
becomes
he
asked
of
all
the
buds
that
bloom
it
was
a
funny
question
it
did
have
a
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
santa
claus
being
a
grandfather
oh
mother
never
throws
away
any
of
the
buds
laughed
rosalee
she
just
keeps
them
year
after
year
and
wires
them
on
all
over
again
all
unfulfilled
wishes
said
my
mother
still
waiting
still
wishing
maybe
they
bloom
some
time
even
carol
camel
she
laughed
out
suddenly
who
knows
but
what
if
you
keep
on
you
actually
travel
some
day
to
the
maybe
maybe
you
own
a
a
dozen
camels
with
purple
velvet
blankets
i
cried
all
trimmed
with
scarlet
silk
tassels
and
smelling
of
sandalwood
i
have
never
understood
said
my
father
that
camels
smelt
of
sandalwood
young
derry
willard
did
seem
exactly
nervous
any
more
but
he
jumped
up
very
suddenly
and
went
and
stood
by
the
fire
it
the
finest
christmas
idea
i
ever
heard
of
he
said
and
if
nobody
has
any
objections
i
like
to
take
a
little
turn
myself
at
the
christmas
tree
oh
but
you
wo
be
here
for
christmas
cried
everybody
all
at
once
no
i
certainly
be
admitted
derry
willard
unless
i
am
invited
why
of
course
you
invited
cried
everybody
father
seemed
to
have
swallowed
something
so
mother
invited
him
twice
father
kept
right
on
choking
everybody
was
frightened
but
mother
young
derry
willard
had
to
run
like
everything
to
catch
his
train
it
was
lucky
that
he
knew
what
he
wanted
with
only
one
wish
to
make
and
only
half
a
minute
to
make
it
in
it
was
wonderful
that
he
could
decide
so
quickly
he
snatched
a
pencil
he
scribbled
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
he
crumpled
the
something
all
up
tight
and
tossed
it
to
mother
carol
and
mother
wadded
it
into
a
bud
they
took
the
rosalee
and
i
wired
it
to
a
branch
we
chose
the
highest
branch
we
could
reach
father
held
his
overcoat
for
him
father
handed
him
his
bag
father
opened
the
door
for
him
he
ran
as
fast
as
he
could
he
waved
his
hand
to
everybody
his
laugh
was
all
sparkly
with
white
teeth
the
room
seemed
a
little
bit
dark
after
he
had
gone
the
firelight
flickered
on
the
tame
coon
collar
sometimes
it
flickered
on
the
single
gold
bud
we
cracked
more
nuts
and
munched
more
raisins
it
made
a
pleasant
noise
the
tame
crow
climbed
up
on
the
and
tapped
and
tapped
against
the
glass
it
was
not
a
pleasant
noise
the
tame
coon
prowled
about
under
the
table
looking
for
crumbs
he
walked
very
flat
and
swaying
and
slow
as
tho
he
were
stuffed
with
wet
sand
it
gave
him
a
very
captive
look
his
eyes
were
very
bright
father
got
his
violin
and
played
some
quivery
tunes
to
us
mother
sang
a
little
it
was
nice
carol
put
fifteen
wishes
on
the
tree
seven
of
them
of
course
were
old
ones
about
the
camel
but
all
the
rest
were
new
he
wished
a
salt
mackerel
for
his
coon
and
a
gold
anklet
for
his
crow
he
would
tell
what
his
other
wishes
were
they
looked
very
pretty
fifteen
silver
buds
as
big
as
cones
scattered
all
through
the
green
branches
rosalee
made
seven
wishes
i
made
seven
mine
were
green
father
made
three
his
were
blue
mother
were
red
she
made
three
too
the
tree
looked
more
and
more
as
tho
rainbows
had
rained
on
it
it
was
beautiful
we
thanked
mother
very
much
for
having
a
garden
we
felt
very
thankful
toward
everybody
we
got
sleepier
and
sleepier
we
went
to
bed
i
woke
in
the
night
it
was
very
lonely
i
crept
to
get
my
best
there
was
a
light
in
the
parlor
there
were
voices
i
peeped
in
it
was
my
father
and
my
mother
they
were
looking
at
the
christmas
tree
i
got
an
awful
shock
they
were
having
what
books
call
words
with
each
other
only
it
was
sentences
impudent
young
cub
said
my
father
how
he
stuff
a
bill
into
our
christmas
tree
oh
i
sure
he
did
mean
to
be
impudent
said
my
mother
her
voice
was
very
soft
he
heard
the
children
telling
about
uncle
charlie
gold
piece
he
he
wanted
to
do
something
i
suppose
it
was
too
much
of
course
he
ought
to
have
done
it
but
a
bill
said
my
father
every
time
he
said
it
he
seemed
madder
and
yet
said
my
mother
if
what
you
say
about
his
father
sugar
plantations
is
correct
a
bill
probably
did
look
any
larger
to
him
than
a
than
a
bill
looks
to
us
this
year
we
simply
return
it
to
him
very
politely
as
soon
as
we
know
his
address
he
was
going
west
somewhere
was
he
we
shall
hear
i
suppose
hear
said
my
father
i
wo
have
it
did
you
see
how
he
stared
at
rosalee
it
was
outrageous
absolutely
outrageous
and
rosalee
i
was
ashamed
of
rosalee
positively
ashamed
but
you
see
it
was
really
the
first
young
man
that
rosalee
has
ever
had
a
chance
to
observe
said
my
mother
if
you
had
ever
been
willing
to
let
boys
come
to
the
house
maybe
she
would
have
considered
this
one
such
a
such
a
thrilling
curiosity
stuff
and
nonsense
said
my
father
she
only
a
child
there
be
no
boys
come
to
this
house
for
years
and
years
she
seventeen
said
my
mother
you
and
i
were
married
when
i
was
seventeen
that
different
said
my
father
he
tried
to
smile
he
could
mother
smiled
quite
a
good
deal
he
jumped
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
he
demanded
things
do
you
mean
to
say
he
demanded
that
you
want
your
daughter
to
marry
this
strange
young
man
not
at
all
said
mother
father
turned
at
the
edge
of
the
rug
and
looked
back
his
face
was
all
frowned
and
i
do
like
him
anyway
he
said
he
too
dark
his
father
roomed
with
you
at
college
you
say
asked
my
mother
very
softly
do
you
remember
him
specially
do
i
remember
him
cried
my
father
he
looked
astonished
do
i
remember
him
why
he
was
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
in
the
world
do
i
remember
him
and
he
was
very
fair
asked
my
mother
fair
cried
my
father
he
was
as
dark
as
a
spaniard
and
yet
reasonably
respectable
asked
my
mother
respectable
cried
my
father
why
he
was
the
man
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
and
so
dark
said
my
mother
she
began
to
laugh
it
was
what
we
call
her
laugh
her
bandage
laugh
it
rolled
all
around
angriness
and
made
it
feel
better
almost
at
once
well
i
ca
help
it
said
father
he
shook
his
head
just
the
way
carol
does
sometimes
when
he
planning
to
be
pleasant
as
soon
as
convenient
well
i
ca
help
it
exceptions
of
course
are
exceptions
but
cuba
a
climate
all
mushy
with
warmth
and
sunshine
what
possible
stamina
can
a
young
man
have
who
grown
up
on
sirup
and
and
bananas
he
seemed
to
have
teeth
said
my
mother
he
ate
two
helpings
of
turkey
he
had
a
gold
said
my
father
my
mother
began
to
laugh
all
over
again
maybe
his
class
gave
it
to
him
she
said
it
seemed
to
be
a
joke
once
father
class
gave
him
a
high
silk
hat
father
laughed
a
little
mother
looked
very
beautiful
she
ruffled
her
hair
a
little
on
shoulder
she
pinked
her
cheeks
from
the
inside
some
way
she
glanced
up
at
the
topmost
branch
of
the
christmas
tree
the
gold
bud
showed
quite
plainly
i
i
what
he
wished
she
said
we
have
to
look
some
time
i
made
a
little
creak
in
my
bones
i
did
mean
to
my
father
and
mother
both
turned
round
they
started
to
explore
i
ran
like
everything
i
think
it
was
very
kind
of
god
to
make
december
have
the
very
shortest
days
in
the
year
summer
of
course
is
nice
the
long
sunny
light
lying
awake
till
nine
every
night
to
hear
the
blackness
come
rustling
such
a
lot
of
early
mornings
everywhere
and
birds
singing
noons
with
cool
milk
to
drink
the
pleasant
nap
before
it
time
to
play
again
but
if
should
feel
long
what
would
children
do
about
christmas
i
mean
even
the
best
way
you
look
at
it
christmas
is
always
the
day
that
i
ever
heard
about
my
mother
was
always
very
kind
about
making
christmas
come
just
as
soon
as
it
could
there
was
much
daylight
not
in
december
not
in
the
north
not
where
we
lived
except
for
the
snow
each
day
was
like
a
little
with
a
single
gold
coin
in
the
center
the
gold
coin
in
the
center
was
it
was
very
bright
it
was
really
the
only
bright
light
in
the
day
we
spent
it
for
christmas
every
minute
of
it
we
popped
corn
and
strung
it
into
lovely
loops
we
threaded
cranberries
we
stuffed
three
yule
logs
with
crackly
cones
and
colored
fires
we
made
little
candies
all
round
the
edges
of
the
bright
of
course
there
was
morning
and
night
and
lamplight
it
was
convenient
to
burn
a
great
many
lamps
at
night
father
and
mother
sat
in
the
lamplight
and
taught
us
our
lessons
or
read
stories
to
us
we
children
sat
in
the
shadows
and
stared
into
the
light
the
light
made
us
blink
the
tame
crow
and
the
tame
coon
sat
in
the
shadows
with
us
we
played
we
were
all
together
waiting
outside
a
man
camp
to
be
christianized
it
was
pleasant
mother
read
to
us
about
a
woman
who
did
like
christmas
specially
she
was
going
to
petition
congress
to
have
the
christ
child
born
in
so
that
christmas
come
oftener
than
once
in
four
years
it
worried
us
a
little
father
laughed
mother
had
only
one
worry
in
the
world
she
had
it
every
year
oh
my
darling
darling
winter
garden
worried
my
mother
would
it
be
if
i
ever
had
to
die
just
as
my
best
christmas
tree
was
coming
into
bloom
it
frightened
us
a
little
but
not
too
much
father
had
the
same
worry
every
spring
about
his
spring
garden
every
maytime
when
the
were
so
fat
and
tight
you
could
fairly
hear
them
splitting
father
worried
oh
would
it
be
perfectly
if
i
should
die
before
i
find
out
whether
those
new
are
everything
that
the
catalogue
promised
or
whether
the
are
really
finer
than
the
now
if
it
was
in
worried
my
father
especially
if
the
phlox
turned
out
magenta
one
could
slip
away
with
scarcely
a
pang
but
in
we
promised
our
mother
she
should
never
die
at
we
promised
our
father
he
should
never
die
at
we
brought
them
rubbers
and
we
carried
their
coats
we
found
their
trowels
we
kept
them
just
as
well
as
we
could
but
most
of
all
of
course
we
were
busy
wondering
about
our
presents
it
hurries
christmas
a
lot
to
have
a
christmas
tree
growing
in
your
parlor
for
a
whole
month
even
if
the
parlor
door
is
locked
lots
of
children
have
a
christmas
tree
for
a
whole
month
but
it
a
tree
its
going
is
very
sad
just
one
little
wee
day
of
perfect
splendor
it
has
and
then
it
begins
to
die
every
day
it
dies
more
it
tarnishes
its
presents
are
all
gathered
its
gets
stale
the
cranberries
smell
it
looks
scragglier
and
scragglier
it
gets
brittle
its
needles
begin
to
fall
pretty
soon
it
nothing
but
a
it
must
be
dreadful
to
start
as
a
christmas
tree
and
end
by
being
nothing
but
a
clutter
but
mother
christmas
tree
is
a
tree
every
day
for
a
month
it
growing
beautifuler
and
beautifuler
the
parlor
is
cool
it
lives
in
a
nice
box
of
earth
it
has
water
every
day
like
a
dog
it
never
dies
it
just
disappears
when
we
come
down
to
breakfast
the
day
after
christmas
it
simply
that
all
it
immortal
always
when
you
remember
it
it
absolutely
perfect
we
liked
very
much
to
see
the
christmas
tree
every
sunday
afternoon
my
mother
unlocked
the
parlor
door
we
were
not
allowed
to
go
in
but
we
could
peep
all
we
wanted
to
it
made
your
heart
crinkle
up
like
a
handful
of
tinsel
to
watch
the
buds
change
into
presents
two
of
carol
silver
buds
had
bloomed
one
of
them
had
bloomed
into
a
package
that
looked
like
a
book
the
other
one
had
strange
humps
only
one
of
rosalee
violet
buds
had
bloomed
but
it
was
a
very
large
box
tied
with
red
ribbon
it
looked
like
a
best
hat
one
of
father
blue
buds
had
bloomed
one
of
mother
red
buds
they
bloomed
very
small
small
enough
to
be
diamonds
or
back
on
the
further
side
of
the
tree
i
could
see
that
one
of
my
green
buds
had
bloomed
it
was
a
long
little
box
it
was
a
narrow
little
box
i
can
most
always
tell
when
there
a
doll
in
a
box
young
derry
golden
bud
had
bloomed
at
all
maybe
it
was
a
late
bloomer
some
things
are
the
tame
coon
salt
fish
i
noticed
never
blooms
at
all
until
just
the
very
last
moment
before
we
go
into
the
parlor
christmas
morning
mother
says
there
a
reason
we
did
bother
much
about
reasons
the
parlor
was
very
cold
it
smelt
very
cold
and
mysterious
we
did
see
how
we
could
wait
carol
helped
us
to
wait
not
being
able
to
talk
carol
has
plenty
of
time
to
think
he
can
write
of
course
but
spelling
is
very
hard
so
he
does
often
waste
his
spelling
on
just
facts
he
waits
till
he
gets
enough
facts
to
make
a
philosophy
before
he
tries
to
spell
it
he
made
a
philosophy
about
christmas
coming
so
slow
he
made
it
on
the
blackboard
in
the
kitchen
he
wrote
it
very
tall
christmas
has
to
come
he
wrote
it
part
of
everything
that
part
of
has
to
come
nothing
can
stop
it
it
runs
like
a
river
it
runs
it
ca
help
itself
i
should
worry
young
derry
willard
never
wrote
at
all
he
telegraphed
his
manners
instead
thank
you
for
thanksgiving
day
he
telegraphed
it
was
very
wonderful
he
did
say
anything
else
he
never
even
mentioned
his
address
u
m
m
said
my
father
it
because
of
the
bill
said
my
mother
he
want
to
give
us
any
chance
to
return
it
humph
said
my
father
do
we
poor
my
mother
glanced
at
the
worn
spot
in
the
rug
she
glanced
at
my
father
coat
we
certainly
do
she
laughed
but
young
derry
willard
did
leave
us
a
bill
to
try
and
make
us
look
any
richer
all
young
derry
willard
was
trying
to
do
was
to
make
us
look
more
christmassy
well
we
ca
accept
it
said
my
father
of
course
we
ca
accept
it
said
my
mother
it
was
a
mistake
but
at
least
it
was
a
very
kind
mistake
said
my
father
kind
said
my
mother
no
matter
how
dark
a
young
man
may
be
or
how
much
and
bananas
he
has
consumed
he
ca
be
absolutely
depraved
as
long
as
he
goes
about
the
world
trying
to
make
things
look
more
christmassy
my
father
looked
up
rather
sharply
my
mother
gave
a
funny
little
gasp
oh
it
all
right
she
said
we
manage
some
way
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
hung
on
a
christmas
tree
or
a
slice
of
roast
beef
some
children
do
get
anything
said
my
father
he
looked
solemn
money
is
very
scarce
he
said
it
always
is
said
my
mother
but
that
no
reason
why
presents
ought
to
be
scarce
my
father
jumped
up
my
father
laughed
great
heavens
woman
he
said
ca
anything
dull
your
courage
not
my
christmas
courage
said
my
mother
my
father
reached
out
suddenly
and
patted
her
hand
oh
all
right
he
said
i
suppose
we
manage
somehow
of
course
we
manage
somehow
said
my
mother
i
ran
back
as
fast
as
i
could
to
carol
and
rosalee
we
thought
a
good
deal
about
young
derry
willard
coming
we
talked
about
it
among
ourselves
we
never
talked
about
it
to
my
father
or
my
mother
i
do
know
why
i
went
and
got
my
best
and
showed
the
fairy
prince
to
carol
carol
stared
and
stared
there
were
palms
and
bananas
in
the
picture
there
was
a
castle
there
was
a
moat
there
was
a
fiery
charger
there
were
dragons
the
fairy
prince
was
all
in
white
armor
with
a
white
plume
in
his
hat
it
grasped
your
heart
it
was
so
beautiful
i
showed
the
picture
to
rosalee
she
was
surprised
she
turned
as
white
as
the
plume
in
the
fairy
prince
hat
she
put
the
book
in
her
top
with
her
ribbons
we
wondered
and
wondered
whether
young
derry
willard
would
come
carol
thought
he
would
i
thought
he
would
rosalee
would
say
carol
thought
it
would
be
too
cold
carol
insisted
that
he
was
a
tropic
and
that
tropics
could
stand
the
cold
that
if
a
single
breath
of
cold
air
struck
a
tropic
he
blew
up
and
froze
rosalee
did
want
young
derry
willard
to
blow
up
and
freeze
anybody
could
see
that
she
did
i
comforted
her
i
said
he
would
come
in
a
huge
fur
coat
carol
insisted
that
tropics
did
have
huge
fur
coats
all
right
then
i
said
he
will
come
in
a
huge
coat
feathers
it
will
be
made
of
with
a
soft
brown
breast
when
he
fluffs
himself
he
will
look
like
the
god
of
all
the
birds
and
of
next
spring
hawks
and
all
evil
things
will
scuttle
away
there
certainly
something
the
matter
with
the
christmas
tree
that
year
it
grew
but
it
did
grow
very
fast
my
father
said
that
perhaps
the
fertilizer
had
been
rich
enough
my
mother
said
that
maybe
all
christmas
trees
were
blooming
rather
late
this
year
seasons
changed
so
my
father
and
mother
did
go
away
to
town
at
all
not
for
a
single
day
late
at
night
after
we
gone
to
bed
we
heard
them
hammering
things
and
running
the
carol
thought
it
smelt
like
kites
rosalee
said
it
sounded
to
her
like
a
blue
silk
waist
it
looked
like
a
worry
to
me
it
got
colder
and
colder
it
snowed
and
snowed
christmas
eve
it
snowed
some
more
it
was
beautiful
we
were
very
much
excited
we
clapped
our
hands
we
stood
at
the
window
to
see
how
white
the
world
was
i
thought
about
the
wise
men
camels
i
wondered
if
they
could
carry
snow
in
their
stomachs
as
well
as
rain
mother
said
camels
were
tropics
and
did
know
anything
about
snow
it
seemed
queer
a
sleigh
drove
up
to
the
door
there
were
three
men
in
it
two
of
them
got
out
the
first
one
was
young
derry
willard
it
was
a
fur
coat
that
he
had
on
he
was
full
of
bundles
my
father
gave
one
gasp
the
the
impudent
young
gasped
my
father
we
ran
to
the
door
the
second
man
looked
just
exactly
like
young
derry
willard
except
that
he
had
on
a
gray
beard
and
a
gray
slouch
hat
he
looked
like
the
picture
of
a
planter
in
uncle
tom
cabin
my
father
and
he
took
just
one
look
at
each
other
and
then
suddenly
they
began
to
pound
each
other
on
the
back
and
to
hug
each
other
hello
old
top
they
shouted
hello
hello
derry
willard
father
cried
a
little
everybody
cried
a
little
or
shouted
or
pounded
somebody
on
the
back
except
young
derry
willard
and
rosalee
young
derry
willard
and
rosalee
just
stood
and
looked
at
each
other
well
well
well
said
derry
willard
father
over
and
over
and
over
twenty
years
years
the
front
hall
was
full
of
bundles
we
fell
on
them
when
we
stepped
and
we
fell
on
new
ones
when
we
tried
to
get
up
whenever
derry
willard
father
was
crying
he
was
laughing
so
this
is
the
wife
he
said
and
these
are
the
children
which
is
rosalee
ah
a
very
pretty
girl
but
not
as
pretty
as
your
wife
he
laughed
twenty
years
years
he
began
all
over
again
a
bit
informal
eh
descending
on
you
like
this
but
i
could
resist
the
temptation
after
i
seen
derry
we
southerners
you
know
our
impulses
are
romantic
tuck
us
away
anywhere
or
turn
us
out
if
you
must
my
father
was
like
a
wild
man
for
joy
he
forgot
all
about
everything
except
twenty
years
ago
we
had
to
put
the
two
derry
willards
to
bed
in
the
parlor
there
was
no
other
room
they
insisted
on
sleeping
with
the
christmas
tree
they
had
camped
under
every
kind
of
branch
and
twig
in
the
world
they
said
but
had
they
camped
under
a
christmas
tree
father
talked
and
talked
and
talked
derry
willard
father
talked
and
talked
and
talked
it
was
about
college
it
was
about
girls
it
was
about
boys
it
was
about
all
sorts
of
pranks
not
any
of
it
was
about
studies
mother
sat
and
laughed
at
them
rosalee
and
young
derry
willard
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
carol
and
i
played
checkers
everybody
forgot
us
i
do
know
who
put
me
to
bed
when
we
came
the
next
morning
and
went
into
the
parlor
to
see
the
christmas
tree
we
every
single
branch
of
it
had
sprouted
tinsel
tassels
there
were
tinsel
stars
all
over
it
red
candles
were
blazing
glass
icicles
glistened
there
were
candy
canes
there
were
tin
trumpets
little
presents
stuck
out
everywhere
through
the
branches
big
white
presents
piled
like
a
snowdrift
all
around
the
base
of
the
tree
young
derry
willard
father
seemed
to
be
still
laughing
he
rubbed
his
hands
together
excuse
me
good
people
he
laughed
for
taking
such
liberties
with
your
tree
but
it
twenty
years
since
i
had
a
chance
to
take
a
real
whack
at
a
christmas
tree
palms
of
course
are
all
right
and
banana
groves
are
half
bad
but
when
it
comes
to
real
landscape
effect
give
me
a
christmas
tree
in
a
new
england
parlor

gasped

box
of
oranges

big
as

the
edges
of
a
little
pool

a
big
big
box
that
looked
like
a
magic
lantern
and
on
every
branch
where
he
had
hung
his
seven
wishes
for
a
camel
there
was
a
white
card
instead
with
the
one
word

written
on
it
everybody
looked
very
much
perplexed
young
derry
willard

laughed
if

said

must
have

to

of
these
days
before

very
long

a
little
red
came
into
her
checks
he
wants
me
to
thank
you
very
much
willard
she
said
but
he
thinks

take
him
to
palestine
if
you
knew
that
he
ca
talk
ca
talk
cried
derry
willard

was
wild
with
joy
he
beat
his
fists
on
the
top
of
the
box
he
stamped
his
feet
he
came
and
burrowed
his
head
in
mother
shoulder
when
carol
burrows
his
head
in
my
mother
shoulder
it
means

me
anything
you
want
to

my
mother

father

made
a
giant
kite
for
carol

nine
feet
tall
my
father

made
the
dearest
little
wooden
for
my
mother
there
a
blue
silk
waist
for
rosalee
my
mother
had
knitted
me
a
doll
its
body
was
knitted
its
cheeks

knitted
its
nose

ate
the
canes
all
the
pink
stripes
all
the
white
stripes
we
sang
carols
we
sang
o
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
build
their
nests
in
the
crotch
of
the
but
the
little
son
of
god
had
no
place
for
his
head
when
he
cameth
to
earth
for
me
rosalee
voice
was
like
a
lark
in
the
sky
carol
face
looked
like
two
larks
in
the
sky
the
tame
crow
stayed
in
the
kitchen
he
was
afraid
of
so
many
strangers
the
tame
coon
was
afraid
of
anything
he
crawled
in
and
out
of
all
the
sniffing
and
sniffing
it
made
a
lovely
crackling
sound
everything
smelt
like
fir
balsam
it
was
more
beautiful
every
minute
even
after
every
last
present
was
picked
from
the
tree
the
tree
was
still
so
fat
and
fluffy
with
tinsel
and
glass
balls
that
it
did
look
robbed
at
all
we
just
sat
back
and
stared
at
it
young
derry
willard
stared
only
at
the
topmost
branch
father
looked
suddenly
at
mother
mother
looked
suddenly
at
rosalee
rosalee
looked
suddenly
at
carol
carol
looked
suddenly
at
me
i
looked
suddenly
at
the
tame
coon
the
tame
coon
kept
right
on
crackling
through
the
young
derry
willard
made
a
funny
little
face
there
seemed
to
be
dust
in
his
throat
his
voice
was
very
dry
he
laughed
my
wish
said
young
derry
willard
seems
to
have
been
the
only
one
that
did
bloom
i
almost
died
with
shame
carol
almost
died
with
shame
in
all
that
splendiferousness
in
all
that
generosity
poor
derry
wish
was
the
only
one
that
had
at
least
bloomed
into
rosalee
jumped
up
very
suddenly
and
ran
into
the
she
looked
as
tho
she
was
going
to
cry
young
derry
willard
followed
her
he
did
run
he
walked
very
slowly
he
looked
a
little
troubled
carol
and
i
began
at
once
to
fold
the
very
usefully
young
derry
willard
father
looked
at
my
father
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
laughing
at
all
or
rubbing
his
hands
i
sorry
dick
he
said
i
always
rather
calculated
somehow
on
having
my
boy
wishes
come
true
my
father
spoke
a
little
sharply
you
must
have
a
lot
of
confidence
he
said
in
your
boy
wishes
i
have
said
young
derry
willard
father
quite
simply
he
a
good
boy
not
only
clever
i
mean
but
good
never
yet
have
i
known
him
to
wish
for
anything
that
was
the
they
too
young
said
my
father
youth
said
derry
willard
father
is
the
one
defect
i
know
of
that
is
incontestably
remedial
how
can
they
possibly
know
their
own
minds
demanded
my
father
no
person
said
derry
willard
father
knows
his
own
mind
until
ready
to
die
but
the
sooner
he
knows
his
own
heart
the
sooner
ready
to
begin
to
live
my
father
stirred
in
his
chair
he
lit
a
cigar
it
went
out
he
lit
it
again
it
went
out
again
he
jerked
his
shoulders
he
looked
nervous
he
talked
about
things
that
nobody
was
talking
about
at
all
the
young
rascal
dropped
a
bill
when
he
was
here
before
he
said
he
said
it
as
tho
it
was
something
very
wicked
young
derry
willard
father
seemed
perfectly
cheerful
did
he
really
he
said
it
a
wonder
the
crow
did
eat
it
snapped
my
father
but
even
the
crow
would
eat
it
eh
said
derry
willard
father
quite
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
again
he
looked
at
my
mother
he
stopped
laughing
his
voice
was
very
gentle
do
be
proud
he
said
do
ever
be
proud
he
threw
out
his
hand
as
tho
he
was
asking
something
what
difference
does
anything
make
in
the
whole
world
he
said
except
just
young
love
and
old
friendship
oh
pshaw
said
father
oh
pshaw
rosalee
came
and
stood
in
the
door
she
looked
only
at
mother
she
had
on
a
red
coat
and
a
red
hat
and
red
mittens
derry
willard
wants
to
see
the
garden
she
said

go

willard
stood
just
behind
her
he
had
on
his
fur
coat
he
looked
very
hard
at
father
when
he
spoke
he
spoke
only
to
father
is
it
all
right
he
said
may
go
my
father
looked
up
and
then
he
looked
down
he
looked
at
derry
willard
father
he
threw
out
his
hands
as
tho
there
was
no
place
left
to
look
a
little
smile
crept
into
one
corner
of
his
mouth
he
tried
to
bite
it
he
could
oh
he
said
carol
and
i
went
out
to
play
we
thought
we
like
to
see
the
garden
too
the
snow
was
almost
as
deep
as
our
heads
all
the
evergreen
trees
were
weighed
down
with
snow
their
branches
dragged
on
the
ground
it
was
like
walking
through
white
plumes
we
found
mother
garden
we
found
rosalee
and
young
derry
willard
standing
right
in
the
middle
of
it
it
was
all
caves
and
castles
it
was
like
a
whole
magic
little
city
all
made
out
of
white
plumes
the
sun
came
out
and
shone
on
it
blue
sky
opened
overhead
everything
crackled
it
was
more
beautiful
even
than
the
christmas
tree
in
the
parlor
they
did
hear
us
rosalee
gave
a
funny
little
cry
it
was
like
a
sob
only
happy
i
love
she
said
i
love
said
derry
willard
he
snatched
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
a
great
shivered
all
its
snow
down
on
them
like
a
veil
we
heard
them
laugh
we
ran
back
to
the
house
we
ran
just
as
fast
as
we
could
it
almost
burst
our
lungs
we
ran
into
the
parlor
i
did
tell
carol
tell
my
father
and
young
derry
willard
father
were
talking
and
talking
behind
great
clouds
of
smoke
the
yule
log
was
blazing
and
sputtering
all
sorts
of
fireworks
and
colors
only
mother
was
watching
it
she
was
paring
apples
as
she
watched
a
little
smile
was
in
her
eyes
what
a
wonderful
wonderful
day
to
have
it
happen
she
said
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
i
ran
upstairs
and
got
my
best
i
brought
it
down
and
opened
it
at
the
picture
of
the
fairy
prince
i
laid
it
open
like
that
in
willard
lap
i
pointed
at
the
picture
i
said
derry
willard
father
put
on
his
glasses
and
looked
at
the
picture
well
upon
my
soul
he
said
where
did
you
get
that
it
my
book
i
said
it
always
been
my
book
my
father
looked
at
the
picture
why
of
all
things
he
said
why
it
looks
exactly
like
derry
said
my
mother
it
derry
said
derry
father
but
do
ever
let
derry
know
that
you
know
that
it
is
it
seems
to
tease
him
a
little
it
seems
to
tease
him
a
very
great
deal
in
fact
being
all
rigged
out
like
that
the
illustrator
is
a

no
paltry
toy
to
be
exhausted
and
sickened
of

a
real
game
logical
unendingly
diverting
hour

my
demonstrators

he
ca
she

very
queer

after
all
no
such
great
harm
in
a
giggle
my
little
girl
posie
cries
all
the
time
the
time
i

the
rich
man

could
wear
the
witch
hideous
cape

our
aunt

and
the
queer
pointed
black
hat
and
the
scraggly
gray
wig
and
the
great
spectacles
and
the
hump
on
her
back
and
my
daughter
posie
has
ti
titian
red
curls
said
the
rich
man
coldly
and
the
most
beautiful
brown
eyes
that
mortal
man
has
ever
seen
and
a
skin
so
fair
that
that
why
i
think
it
would
rest
her
so
said
our
aunt
esta
to
be
ugly
outside
instead
of
inside
for
a
while
said
the
rich
man
he
glared
at
our
aunt
esta
our
aunt
esta
glared
at
him
out
in
the
kitchen
suddenly
the
most
beautiful
smell
happened
the
smell
was
soup
spiced
tomato
soup
it
was
as
though
the
whole
stove
had
bloomed
my
father
came
to
the
door
what
it
all
about
he
said
he
saw
the
rich
man
the
rich
man
saw
him
why
how
do
you
do
said
my
father
why
how
do
you
do
said
the
rich
man
they
bowed
there
was
no
room
on
the
dining
room
table
to
put
the
dishes
there
was
no
room
anywhere
for
anything
we
had
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
my
mother
made
griddle
cakes
the
rich
man
stirred
the
batter
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
funny
carol
had
to
sit
on
a
our
aunt
esta
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
barrel
with
her
stockings
swinging
it
made
her
look
not
so
strict
all
the
same
worried
the
rich
man
i
do
see
just
why
you
fixed
the
price
at
two
hundred
dollars
and
cents
why
not
two
hundred
dollars
and
cents
or
even
the
round
sum
two
hundred
and
one
dollars
our
aunt
esta
looked
pretty
mad
i
will
be
very
glad
i
sure
she
said
to
submit
an
itemized
bill
oh
nonsense
said
the
rich
man
it
was
just
your
mental
processes
i
was
wondering
the
thing
of
course
is
worth
any
money
if
it
works
if
it
works
cried
our
aunt
esta
the
rich
man
jumped
up
and
strode
fiercely
to
the
dining
room
door
our
aunt
esta
strode
fiercely
after
him
only
littler
our
aunt
esta
is
little
the
rich
man
waved
his
arms
at
everything
the
boxes
the
bundles
the
the
cloaks
the
suits
the
chinese
lanterns
all
the
same
the
thing
is
perfectly
outrageous
the
size
of
it
the
extent
no
house
would
hold
it
it
is
meant
said
our
aunt
esta
to
be
played
just
in
the
it
meant
to
be
played
on
a
sunny
porch
opening
out
on
a
green
lawn
so
that
there
plenty
of
room
for
all
posie
little
playmates
to
go
swarming
in
and
out
the
rich
man
looked
queer
he
gave
a
little
shiver
my
little
daughter
posie
has
got
any
playmates
he
said
she
too
cross
our
aunt
esta
stood
up
very
straight
two
red
spots
flamed
in
her
cheeks
you
wo
be
able
to
keep
the
children
away
from
her
she
said
after

cried
the
rich
man
out
in
the
kitchen
my
father
looked
at
my
mother
my
mother
looked
at
my
father
they
both
looked
at
us
my
father
made
a
little
chuckle
it
would
seem
said
my
father
as
though
it
was
the
honor
of
the
whole
family
that
was
involved
he
made
a
whisper
in
carol

to
it

whispered
rosalee

to
her
feet

to
his
feet

shining
who

i
cried
s
s
h
said
everybody
except
our
aunt
esta
our
aunt
esta
suddenly
seemed
very
much
encouraged
she
did
wait
a
minute
she
snatched
a
little
book
from
her
pocket
it
was
a
little
book
that
she
had
made
herself
all
full
of
typewriter
directions
about
the
game
of
course
she
said
will
have
to
be
the
witch
someone
who
knows
the
game
i
mean
so
perhaps
i
we
rushed
to
help
her
drag
the
old
battered
tricycle
to
the
porch
we
helped
her
open
up
every
porch
door
till
all
the
green
lawn
and
gay
petunia
blossoms
came
right
up
and
fringed
with
the
old
porch
rug
we
helped
her
tie
on
the
witch
funny
hat
and
the
scraggly
gray
wig
and
the
great
spectacles
we
helped
her
climb
into
the
tricycle
seat
we
were
too
excited
to
stay
on
the
porch
we
wheeled
her
right
out
on
the
green
lawn
itself
the
green
lilac
hedge
reared
all
up
around
her
like
a
magic
wall
we
screamed
with
joy
the
rich
man
jumped
when
we
screamed
the
rich
man
name
was
trent
and
trent
shall
be
the
black
woman
who
pushes
you
all
about

but
carol
had
already
tied
a
black
velvet
ribbon
on
the
rich
man
leg
to
that
he
was
our
aunt
esta
seemed
more
encouraged
every
minute
she
stood
us
all
up
in
front
of
her
even
father
she
read
from
her
book
it
was
a
poem

the
rich
man

glared
our
aunt

tried
to
read
from
her
book
and
wave
her
wand
at
the
same
time
it
waved
the
rich
man
in
the
nose
foul
menial

our
aunt
esta

the
captives

all
up
in
silver
paper
chains
he
put
a
silver
paper
ring
through
my
beautiful
nose
oh

protested
my
father
it
was
that
i
understood

not
captives
ha
sniffed
the
rich
man
be
a
sport
they
both
glared
our
aunt
esta
had
cakes
in
a
box
they
seemed
to
be
very
good
cakes
now
in
about
ten
minutes
read
our
aunt
esta
from
her
book
you
will
all
begin
to
feel
very
queer
oh
lordy
said
my
father
i
knew
it
said
the
rich
man
i
knew
it
all
the
time
from
the
very
first
mouthful
my
stomach
is
there
no
antidote
cried
my
mother
our
aunt
esta
took
off
her
spectacles
she
sniffed
sillies
she
said
this
is
just
a
game
you
know
nevertheless
said
the
rich
man
i
certainly
feel
very
queer
when
you
all
feel
equally
queer
said
our
aunt
esta
coldly
we
will
proceed
with
the
game
we
all
felt
equally
queer
just
as
soon
as
we
could
our
aunt
esta
made
a
speech
she
made
it
from
her
little
book
poor
helpless
captives
said
the
speech
you
are
now
entirely
in
my
power
yet
fear
not
if
everybody
does
just
exactly
as
i
say
all
may
yet
be
well
hear
hear
said
my
father
the
rich
man
suddenly
seemed
to
like
my
father
very
much
he
reached
over
and
nudged
him
in
the
ribs
shut
up
he
whispered
the
less
you
say
the
sooner
it
will
be
over
my
father
said
less
at
once
he
seemed
very
glad
to
know
about
it
our
aunt
esta
pointed
to
a
boxful
of
little
envelopes
foul
menial
she
said
bring
the
little
envelopes
the
rich
man
brought
them
but
not
very
cheerfully
oh
of
course
it
all
right
to
call
that
he
said
but
i
tell
you
quite
frankly
that
my
daughter
posie
maid
will
never
stand
for
it
name
is
elizabeth
lou
mrs
jane
frank
elizabeth
lou
even
our
aunt
esta
looked
at
the
rich
man
her
look
was
scornfuller
and
scornfuller
witch
servants
she
said
are
called
menial
from
the
earliest
classical
records
of
fairy
tale
and
legend
down
to
not
in
our
times
insisted
the
rich
man
i
defy
you
in
any
intelligence
office
in
new
york
to
find
a
a
our
aunt
esta
brushed
the
contradiction
aside
she
frowned
not
just
at
the
rich
man
but
at
everybody
we
will
proceed
with
the
rehearsal
as
written
she
said
she
gruffed
her
voice
she
thumped
her
wand
on
the
floor
each
captive
she
said
will
now
step
forward
and
draw
a
little
envelope
from
the
box
each
captive
stepped
forward
and
drew
a
little
envelope
from
the
box
inside
each
envelope
was
a
little
card
very
black
ink
words
were
written
on
each
card
captives

up
very
straight
ordered
our
aunt
esta
every
captive

very
straight

but
not
too
hard
remembering

every
captive
strained
at
his
chains
but
not
too
hard

very
much
pleased

read
another
poem
from
her
book
the
poem
said

thus
in
my
witchy
wiles
robbed
of
all
hope
all

our
mother

nothing
save
us
my
father
burst
his
rosalee
giggled
carol
and
i
jumped
up
and
down
we
clapped
our
hands
the
rich
man
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
he
looked
at
our
aunt
esta
at
her
funny
black
pointed
hat
at
her
scraggly
gray
wig
at
her
great
spectacles
at
the

into
a
green
go

carol
went
hence
he
henced
as
far
as
the
mulberry
tree
on
the
front
lawn
he
sat
down
on
the
grass
with
the
card
in
his
hand
he
read
the
card
and
read
it
and
read
it
it
puzzled
him
very
much
pitiful
wretch

cried
our
aunt
esta
he
henced
as
far
as
the
larch
tree
this
time
and
sat
down
all
over
again
and
puzzled
and
puzzled
go
i
say
pitiful
wretch
insisted
our
aunt
esta
my
mother
did
like
carol
to
be
called
a
pitiful
wretch

because

was
dumb

my
mother
does
like

her
own
business

even
our

a
bit
flabbergasted
oh

our
aunt

certainly
am
sorry
that
it
was
you
who
happened
to
draw
that
one
and
all
dressed
up
in
white
too
as
you
are
but
after
all
she
jerked
with
a
great
toss
of
her
scraggly
wig
a
game
is
a
game
and
there
can
be
no
concessions
no
of
course
not

me
to
the
slaughter

is
not
necessarily
any
slaughter

our
aunt

very
haughtily
but
she
hit
my
mother
only
once
with
her
wand
frail
creature
she
said
on
the
topmost
branch
of
the
tallest
tree
in
the
world
there

a
silver
bird
with
a
song
in
his
throat
that
has
never
been
sung
unless
you
bring
me
this
bird
you
are
hereby
doomed
to
walk
with
the
clatter
of
a
horse

my
mother
with
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoof
my
father
was
pretty
mad
why

impossible

said
she
as
light
as
even
in
her
boots
it
like
a
fairy
passing
nevertheless
insisted
our
aunt
esta
she
shall
walk
with
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoof
unless
she
brings
me
the
silver
bird
my
mother
started
at
once
for
the
little
woods
i
can
at
least
search
the
tallest
tree
in
world
she
said
it
made
my
father
nervouser
and
nervouser

called
after
her
climb
until
i
come
base
interloper

our
aunt

my
father
said
our
aunt
esta
i
giggled
our
aunt
esta
was
very
mad
she
turned
me
into
a
white
rabbit
i
was
made
of
white
canton
flannel
i
was
very
soft
i
had
long
ears
they
were
they
were
lined
with
pink
velvet
they
hung
way
down
over
my
shoulders
so
i
could
stroke
them
i
liked
them
very
much
but
my
legs
looked
like
white
was
my
name
our
aunt
esta
scolded
it
at
me
because
of
your
impudence
she
said
you
shall
not
be
allowed
to
roam
the
woods
and
fields
at
will
but
shall
stay
here
in
captivity
close
by
my
side
and
help
the
foul
menial
do
the
chores
the
rich
man
seemed
very
much
pleased
he
winked
an
eye
he
pulled
one
of
my
it
was
nice
to
have
somebody
pleased
with
me
everybody
was
pleased
with
rosalee
bewitchment
it
sounded
so
restful
all
rosalee
had
to
do
was
to
be
very
pretty
just
exactly
as
she
was
and
seventeen
years
old
just
exactly
as
she
was
and
sit
on
the
big
gray
rock
by
the
side
of
the
brook
just
exactly
as
it
was
and
see
whether
it
was
a
bright
green
celluloid
fish
or
a
bright
red
celluloid
fish
that
came
down
the
brook
first
and
if
it
was
a
bright
green
celluloid
fish
she
was
to
catch
it
and
slit
open
its
stomach
and
take
out
all
its
directions
and
follow
and
if
it
was
a
bright
red
celluloid
fish
she
was
to
catch
and
take
out
all
its
directions
and
follow
in
either
case
her
card
said
she
would
need
rubbers
and
a
it
sounded
like
buried
treasure
to
me
or
else
iris
roots
our
aunt
esta
is
very
much
interested
in
iris
roots
it
was
my
father
bewitchment
that
made
the
only
real
trouble
nothing
at
all
was
postponed
about
my
father
bewitchment
it
happened
all
at
once
it
was
because
my
father
knew
too
much
it
was
about
the
alphabet
that
he
knew
too
much
the
words
on
my
father
card
said
alphabet
and
backwards
and
pink
silk
fairy
and
tin
locomotive
head
and
three
minutes
our
aunt
esta
turned
my
father
into
a
pink
silk
fairy
with
white
tarlatan
wings
because
he
was
able
to
say
the
alphabet
backwards
in
three
minutes
my
father
refused
to
turn
he
would
he
would
he
swore
he
would
he
said
it
was
a
cruel
and
unnecessary
punishment
our
aunt
esta
said
it
was
a
punishment
it
was
a
reward
it
was
the
tin
locomotive
head
that
was
the
punishment
my
father
said
he
would
have
cared
a
rap
if
it
had
been
the
tin
locomotive
head
he
could
have
smoked
through
that
but
he
be
a
pink
silk
fairy
with
white
tarlatan
wings
the
rich
man
began
right
away
to
untie
the
black
velvet
ribbon
on
his
leg
and
go
home
he
looked
very
cheated
he
scorned
my
father
with
ribald
glances
work
he
gloated
it
wo
work
i
knew
all
the
time
it
would
work
two
hundred
dollars
and
cents
he
gloated
our
aunt
esta
cried
she
put
her
hand
on
my
father
arm
it
was
a
very
small
hand
it
did
look
a
bit
like
a
witch
hand
except
for
having
no
lovingness
in
it
it
looked
a
good
deal
like
my
mother
hand
my
father
consented
to
be
turned
a
little
but
not
much
he
consented
to
wear
the
white
tarlatan
wings
and
the
gold
paper
crown
but
not
the
garland
of
roses
he
would
carry
the
pink
silk
dress
on
his
arm
he
said
but
he
would
wear
it
the
rich
man
seemed
very
much
encouraged
he
stopped
untying
the
black
velvet
ribbon
from
his
leg
he
grinned
a
little
my
father
told
him
what
he
thought
of
him
the
rich
man
acknowledged
that
very
likely
it
was
so
but
he
did
seem
to
mind
he
kept
right
on
grinning
my
father
stalked
away
in
his
gold
paper
crown
with
the
pink
dress
over
his
arm
he
looked
very
proud
and
noble
he
looked
as
though
even
if
dogs
were
sniffing
at
his
heels
he
would
turn
his
white
wings
flapped
as
he
walked
the
spangles
shone
it
looked
very
holy
the
rich
man
made
a
funny
noise
it
sounded
like
snorting
my
father
turned
round
quicker
than
he
glared
right
through
the
rich
man
at
our
aunt
esta
he
told
our
aunt
esta
just
what
he
thought
of
the
rich
man
said
it
was
so
at
all
that
the
game
undoubtedly
was
perfectly
practical
if
if
said
my
father
it
you
yourself
that
are
spoiling
the
whole
effect
by
running
around
playing
you
a
black
slave
with
nothing
on
but
a
velvet
ribbon
round
one
knee
the
very
you
could
do
said
my
father
is
to
have
your
face
blacked
and
wear
a
plaid
skirt
said
the
rich
man
our
aunt
esta
was
perfectly
delighted
with
the
suggestion
the
rich
man
took
her
delight
coldly
he
glared
at
my
father
i
do
think
i
need
any
outside
help
he
said
in
the
management
of
my
as
the
owner
indeed
of
one
of
the
largest
stores
in
the
world
i
that
all
right
said
my
father
but
you
never
yet
have
tried
to
manage
the
children
aunt
nothing
can
stop
her
nothing
could
she
pinned
an
old
plaid
shawl
around
the
rich
waist
she
blacked
his
face
he
had
to
kneel
at
her
feet
while
it
was
being
blacked
he
seemed
to
sweat
easily
but
our
aunt
esta
blacked
very
easily
too
he
looked
lovely
even
my
father
thought
he
looked
lovely
when
he
was
done
he
wanted
to
look
in
a
mirror
my
father
advised
him
not
to
but
he
insisted
my
father
got
up
from
making
suggestions
and
came
and
stood
behind
him
while
he
looked
they
looked
only
once
something
seemed
to
hit
them
they
doubled
right
up
it
was
laughter
that
hit
them
they
slapped
each
other
on
the
back
they
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
they
made
such
a
noise
that
my
mother
came
running
it
seemed
to
make
our
aunt
esta
a
little
bit
nervous
to
have
my
mother
come
running
she
pointed
her
wand
she
roared
her
voice
where
is
the
silver
bird
she
roared
my
mother
looked
just
as
as
she
could
she
fell
on
her
knees
she
clasped
her
hands
oh
cruel
witch
she
said
i
the
bird
but
i
could
reach
him
he
was
in
the
poplar
tree
however
in
the
world
did
you
put
him
there
was
that
what
you
were
bribing
the
butcher
boy
about
this
morning
was
that
hush
roared
our
aunt
esta
your
doom
has
overtaken
you
go
hence
with
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoof
until
such
time
as
your
incompetent
head
may
oh
it
was
my
head
that
was
incompetent
said
my
mother
it
was
my
legs
the
poplar
tree
was
so
very
tall
so
very
fluffy
and
undecided
to
climb
so
with
the
clatter
of
a
horse
hoof
insisted
our
aunt
esta
there
can
be
no
mercy
none
implored
my
mother
none
said
our
aunt
esta
she
gave
my
mother
two
funny
little
wooden
cups
they
were
something
like
clappers
you
could
hold
them
in
your
hand
so
they
scarcely
showed
at
all
and
make
a
noise
like
a
horse
galloping
across
a
bridge
or
trotting
or
anything
it
made
quite
a
loud
noise
it
was
wonderful
my
mother
started
right
away
for
the
village
she
had
on
white
shoes
her
feet
were
very
small
she
sounded
like
a
great
team
horse
stumbling
up
the
plank
of
a
i
think
i
go
get
the
mail
she
said
like
that
screamed
my
father
my
mother
turned
around
her
hair
was
all
curly
there
were
laughs
in
her
eyes
i
to
she
said
i
bewitched
i
go
with
you
said
my
father
my
mother
turned
around
again
she
looked
at
my
father
at
his
golden
crown
at
his
white
spangled
wings
at
the
pink
silk
skirt
over
his
arm
like
that
said
my
mother
my
father
decided
not
to
go
the
rich
man
said
he
considered
the
decision
very
wise
they
glared
way
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
green
lilac
hedge
we
heard
my
mother
trotting
down
the
driveway
clack
sounded
the
my
lord
she
pacing
groaned
my
father
clever
work
said
the
rich
man
was
she
ever
in
a
band
in
a
jazz
band
you
know
with
bantam
rooster
whistles
and
drums
that
bark
like
dogs
in
a
cried
my
father
he
was
awful
mad
our
aunt
esta
tried
to
soothe
him
with
something
worse
she
turned
to
me
now
she
said
let
us
see
what
can
do
to
redeem
the
ignominy
of
your
impudent
giggling
she
handed
me
the
bright
green
and
the
bright
red
celluloid
fishes
she
poked
her
wand
at
me
hopping
all
the
way
she
said
every
step
of
the
way
you
understand
bear
these
two
fish
to
the
of
the
magic
brook
the
little
pool
under
the
apple
tree
will
do
and
start
them
ex
ex
peditiously
down
the
brook
towards
rosalee
yes
i
said
our
aunt
esta
turned
to
the
rich
man
foul
menial
she
said
push
my
chariot
a
little
further
down
the
lawn
into
the
shade
the
foul
menial
pushed
it
my
father
pushed
a
little
too
i
hopped
along
beside
them
flopping
my
long
ears
our
aunt
esta
looked
like
a
witch
the
rich
man
black
face
was
leaking
a
little
but
not
much
it
would
have
been
easier
if
he
had
tripped
so
often
on
his
plaid
shawl
skirt
my
father
white
wings
flapped
as
he
pushed
he
looked
like
an
angel
who
was
quite
hatched
it
was
handsome
when
we
got
to
the
thickest
shade
there
was
a
man
black
felt
hat
bobbing
along
the
top
of
the
japonica
hedge
it
was
rather
a
looking
hat
it
was
bobbing
just
as
fast
as
it
could
towards
the
house
when
our
aunt
esta
saw
the
hat
she
screamed
she
jumped
from
her
chariot
as
though
it
had
been
flames
she
tore
the
scraggly
gray
wig
from
her
head
she
tore
the
hump
from
her
back
she
kicked
off
her
wooden
shoes
her
feet
were
silk
she
ran
like
the
wind
for
the
back
door
my
father
ran
for
the
the
rich
man
dove
into
the
lilac
bush
when
the
rich
man
was
all
through
diving
into
the
lilac
bush
he
seemed
to
think
that
he
was
the
only
one
present
who
had
done
anything
what
you
so
scared
about
ruthy
he
said
what
the
matter
with
everybody
who
the
bloke
it
the
new
minister
i
said
has
he
got
the
cholera
or
anything
said
the
rich
man
no
not
exactly
i
explained
he
just
our
aunt
esta
suitor
your
aunt
esta
cried
the
rich
man
he
clapped
his
hand
over
his
mouth
he
burst
a
that
helped
lash
the
plaid
shawl
around
him
what
do
you
mean
he
said
it
seemed
queer
he
was
so
stupid
why
a
suitor
i
explained
is
a
person
who
does
suit
so
he
keeps
right
on
coming
most
every
day
to
see
if
he
does
as
soon
as
he
suits
of
course
he
your
husband
and
does
come
any
more
at
all
because
he
already
there
the
new
minister
i
explained
very
patiently
is
a
suitor
for
our
aunt
esta
hand
we
crawled
through
the
lilac
bush
we
peeped
out
our
aunt
esta
had
reached
the
back
door
at
all
she
sat
all
huddled
up
in
a
little
heap
on
the
embankment
trying
to
keep
the
new
minister
from
seeing
that
she
was
in
her
but
the
new
minister
did
seem
to
see
anything
at
all
except
her
hands
being
a
suitor
for
her
hands
it
was
natural
i
suppose
that
he
was
interested
in
anything
except
her
hands
her
hands
were
on
her
hair
the
scraggly
gray
wig
had
rumpled
all
the
seriousness
out
of
her
hair
it
looked
quite
jolly
the
new
minister
stared
and
stared
and
stared
except
for
having
no
lovingness
in
them
her
hands
looked
much
like
my
mother
our
aunt
esta
got
nice
hands
i
said
the
rich
man
burst
another
safety
pin
yes
by
jove
he
said
and
nice
feet
too
he
seemed
quite
surprised
how
long
this
minister
fellow
been
coming
here
he
said
oh
i
do
know
i
said
he
comes
whenever
our
aunt
esta
comes
the
rich
man
made
a
grunt
he
looked
at
the
minister
hat
think
of
courting
a
woman
he
said
in
a
hat
like
that
oh
our
aunt
esta
does
care
anything
at
all
about
hats
i
said
it
time
she
did
said
the
rich
man
we
go
out
if
you
say
so
i
suggested
and
help
them
have
a
pleasant
time
the
rich
man
was
awful
mad
he
pointed
at
his
plaid
shawl
he
pointed
at
his
black
face
he
said
go
out
like
and
make
a
fool
of
myself
before
that
why
he
love
it
i
said
the
rich
man
choked
that
quite
enough
reason
he
said
there
was
a
noise
in
the
we
could
see
the
noise
through
the
window
it
was
my
father
trying
to
untie
his
wings
he
could
the
rich
man
seemed
to
feel
better
suddenly
he
began
to
mop
his
face
it
a
great
game
all
right
he
said
if
you
do
weaken
he
pulled
my
ears
but
why
in
the
world
ruthy
he
worried
did
she
have
to
go
and
tuck
that
cents
on
to
the
end
of
the
bill
why
that
her
profit
i
explained
her
profit
gasped
the
rich
man
her
why
she
had
to
have
something
i
explained
she
was
planning
to
have
more
of
course
she
was
planning
to
go
to
atlantic
city
but
everything
costs
so
big
even
toys
it
her
gasped
the
rich
man
cents
on
a
two
hundred
dollar
deal
he
began
to
laugh
and
laugh
and
she
calls
herself
a
business
woman
he
said
why
she
ought
to
be
in
an
asylum
all
women
in
fact
ought
to
be
in
asylums
or
else
in
homes
of
their
own
quite
furiously
he
began
to
pull
my
ears
all
over
again
he
said
and
both
her
feet
would
go
at
once
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
woman
out
in
the
roadway
suddenly
somebody
sneezed
it
made
the
rich
man
jump
awfully
ruthy
stay
where
you
are
he
ordered
i
ca
i
called
back
i
already
hopped
out
from
my
i
could
see
the
person
who
sneezed
anybody
would
have
known
that
it
was
she
was
sitting
in
an
automobile
peering
through
the
hedge
there
was
a
black
woman
with
her
the
rich
man
crackled
in
the
bushes
he
reached
out
and
grabbed
my
foot
he
pulled
me
back
his
face
looked
pretty
queer
yes
she
been
there
all
the
time
he
whispered
but
not
a
soul
knows
it
i
wanted
her
to
see
it
work
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
she
liked
it
but
i
was
afraid
to
bring
her
in
she
catches
everything
so
and
i
knew
there
were
children
here
and
i
was
afraid
there
might
be
something
contagious
he
peered

out
between

a

like

the
witch
in
the
chair
he
thought
the
witch

posie
he
grabbed
her
right
up
in
his
arms
and
her
though
i
late
for

directors

our
aunt
esta
she

scratched
she
shook
her
scraggly
gray
all
over
her
face
it
was
like
a
mask
but
all
the
time
she
kept
right
on
laughing
she
could
seem
to
stop
the
rich
man
kissed
her
and
kissed
her
right
through
her
scraggly
gray
he
kissed
her
he
could
seem
to
stop
now

our
aunt
esta
tore
off

tore
off

hump
she
shook
her
fist
at
the
rich
man
but
she
could
stop
laughing
the
rich
man
gave
one
awful
gasp
he
turned
red
he
turned
white
he
looked
at
the
window
to
see
if
my
father
had
seen
him
my
father
had
seen
him
the
rich
man
said
things
under
his
breath
that
is
most
of
them
were
under
his
breath
he
stalked
to
his
car
he
ordered
the
black
woman
to
pick
up
the
real
posie
and
stalk
to
his
car
he
looked
madder
than
pirates
but
when
he
had
climbed
into
his
car
and
had
started
his
engine
and
was
all
ready
to
go
he
stood
up
on
the
seat
instead
and
peered
over
the
at
our
aunt
esta
and
grinned
our
aunt
esta
was
standing
just
where
he
had
left
her
all
the
laughter
was
gone
from
her
but
her
eyes
looked
very
astonished
her
cheeks
were
blazing
red
her
hair
was
all
gay
and
rumpled
like
a
it
seemed
somehow
to
be
rather
becoming
to
our
aunt
esta
to
be
kissed
by
mistake
the
rich
man
made
a
little
noise
in
his
throat
our
aunt
esta
looked
up
she
jumped
the
rich
man
fixed
his
eyes
right
on
her
his
eyes
were
full
of
twinkles
talk
about
he
said
talk
about
be
back
on
tuesday
what
for
great
jumping
jehosophats
he
said
it
enough
that
i
be
back
my
father
stuck
his
head
and
the
tip
of
one
battered
wing
out
the
window
he
started
to
say
something
and
cocked
his
ear
instead
it
was
towards
the
village
that
he
cocked
his
ear
we
all
stopped
and
cocked
our
ears
it
was
a
funny
sound
it
was
my
mother
cantering
home
across
the
wooden
bridge
it
sounded
glad
my
father
thought
of
a
new
way
suddenly
to
escape
from
his
wings
and
ran
to
meet
her
the
blinded
lady
the
blinded
lady
lived
in
a
little
white
cottage
by
the
mill
dam
she
had
cats
and
a
braided
rug
and
a
chinese
cabinet
all
full
of
fans
our
father
and
mother
took
us
to
see
them
it
smelt
furry
carol
wore
his
blue
suit
rosalee
wore
an
almost
dress
i
wore
my
new
middy
blouse
we
looked
nice
the
blinded
lady
looked
nice
too
she
sat
in
a
very
little
chair
in
the
middle
of
a
very
large
room
her
skirts
were
silk
and
very
fat
they
fluffed
all
around
her
like
a
she
had
on
a
white
lace
cap
there
were
violets
in
the
cap
her
eyes
did
look
blinded
we
sat
on
the
edge
of
our
chairs
and
stared
at
her
and
stared
she
did
mind
all
the
cats
came
and
purred
their
sides
against
our
legs
it
felt
soft
and
sort
of
bubbly
the
blinded
lady
recited
poetry
to
us
she
recited
gray
elegy
in
a
country
churchyard
she
recited
the
charge
of
the
light
brigade
she
recited
bingen
on
the
rhine
when
she
got
all
through
reciting
poetry
she
asked
us
if
we
knew
any
we
did
we
knew
onward
christian
soldiers
and
hey
diddle
diddle
the
cat
and
the
fiddle
and
rosalee
knew
two
verses
about

many
and
many
a

in
a
kingdom
by
the
sea
that
a
maiden
lived
whom
you
may
know
by
the
name
of
annabel
lee
we
hoped
the
blinded
lady
would
be
pleased
she
was
the
blinded
lady
said
it
was
nearly
enough
just
to
know
the
first
two
verses
of
anything
that
you
ought
to
know
all
the
verses
of
everything
the
blinded
lady
said
that
every
baby
just
as
soon
as
it
was
born
ought
to
learn
every
poem
that
it
possibly
could
so
that
if
it
ever
grew
up
and
was
blinded
it
would
have
something
to
amuse
itself
with
we
promised
we
would
we
asked
the
blinded
lady
what
made
her
blinded
she
said
it
was
because
she
made
all
her
father
shirts
when
she
was
six
years
old
we
promised
we
would
and
now
said
the
blinded
lady

little
dumb
boy

at
my
knee
so

can
touch
his
face
carol

exactly
like
to
be
called
the
little
dumb
boy
but
he
came
forward
very
politely
and
stood
at
the
blinded
lady
knee
the
blinded
lady
ran
her
fingers
all
up
and
down
his
face
it
tickled
his
nose

puckered

a
pleasant
face

the
blinded

the

lady
she
pushed

she
thumped
her
cane
on
the
braided
rug
there
one
here
is
there
she
said
that

got
anything
to
be
sensitive
about

young
lassie

she
said
so
i
can
touch
her

it
made
rosalee
very
pink
to
have
her

explored
the
blinded
lady
laughed
as
she
explored
it
ha
she
said
age
about
seventeen
gold
hair
eyes
complexion
like
peaches
and
cream
not
much
cause
here
laughed
the
blinded
lady
for
this
young
lassie
ever
to
worry
when
she
looks
in
the
glass
oh
but
she
does
i
cried
she
worries
herself
most
to
death
every
time

looks
she
afraid
her
hair

turn
gray
before

said
everybody
the
blinded
lady
cocked
her
head
she
ruffled
herself
it
looked
like
feathers
derry
said
the
blinded
lady
who
derry
a
my
father
gruffed
his
throat
oh
derry
just
a
young
friend
of
ours
he
said
he
lives
in
cuba
said
my
mother
cuba
an
island
i
said
it
floats
in
water

eat
bananas

have
fights
it
very
hot
there
lots
of
moonlight
derry
father
says
that
when
rosalee
married
he
build
a
hush
ruthy
said
my
father
you
talked
quite
enough
already
the
blinded
lady
patted
her
skirts
they
billowed
all
around
her
like
black
silk
waves
it
looked
funny
she
said
let
the
come
forward
now
so
that
i
can
feel
her
face
i
went
forward
just
as
fast
as
i
could
the
blinded
lady
touched
my
forehead
she
smoothed
my
nose
my
cheeks
my
chin
she
said
and
you
say
is
what
you
call
her
my
father
twinkled
his
eyes
we
have
to
call
her
something
he
said
politely
and
is
this
bump
on
the
forehead
a
natural
one
said
the
blinded
lady
or
an
accidental
one
both
said
my
father
that
is
it
natural
for
our
daughter
ruthy
to
have
an
accidental
bump
on
her
forehead
and
there
are
i
infer
said
the
blinded
lady
one
or
two
freckles
on
either
side
of
the
nose
your
estimate
said
my
father
is
conservative
and
the
hair
said
the
blinded
lady
it
has
exactly
the
texture
of
gold
we
call
it
said
my
mother
and
not
exactly
a
penny
at
that
is
it
said
the
blinded
lady
n
o
said
my
mother
but
rather
jolly
all
the
same
like
a
penny
that
just
bought
two
sticks
of
candy
instead
of
one
and
the
nose
turns
up
a
little
said
the
blinded
lady
well
maybe
just
a
trifle
admitted
my
mother
the
blinded
lady
stroked
my
face
all
over
again
she
said
well
at
least
it
something
to
be
thankful
for
that
everything
is
perfectly
normal
she
put
her
hands
on
my
shoulders
she
shook
me
a
little
never
ruthie
she
said
be
so
foolish
as
to
complain
because
you
not
pretty
no
i
promised
put
all
the
beauty
you
can
your
head
said
the
blinded
lady
yes
i
promised
and
i
just
thought
of
another
one
that
i
know
it
about
you
must
wake
and
call
me
early
call
me
early
mother

for
i
to
be

said
the
blinded
lady
it
was
sounds
i
was
thinking
of
this
time
but
she
pushed
me
away
she
sighed
and
sighed
it
puffed
her
all
out
o

my

fur
and
splashed
with
milk
instead
of
water

quarts
does
it
take

rosalee
clapped
her
hands
i
clapped
my
hands

at
the
same
moment
we
shut
our
eyes
perfectly
tight
and
played
we
were
blinded
all
the
way
home
our
father
and
mother
had
to
lead
us
it
was
pretty
bumpy
i
peeped
some
rosalee
walked
with
her
hands
stretched
way
out
in
front
of
her
as
though
she
was
reaching
for
something
she
looked
like
a
picture
it
was
like
a
picture
of
something
very
gentle
and
wishful
that
she
looked
like
it
made
me
feel
queer
carol
walked
with
his
nose
all
puckered
up
as
though
he
was
afraid
something
smelly
was
going
to
hit
him
it
make
me
feel
queer
at
all
it
made
me
laugh
it
did
make
my
father
laugh
now

here
you
young
lunatics
said
my
father
if

going
to
drag
you
up
the
main
village
street
acting
like

we
were
sorry

it
to
be
when
we
got
to
the
village
street
we
bumped
right
into
the
old
doctor
we
bumped
him
pretty
hard
he
had
to
sit
down
i
climbed
into
his
lap
of
course
i
do
know
that
it
i
said
but
i
think
it
is
the
old
doctor
seemed
pretty
astonished
he
snatched
at
my
father
and
my
mother
great
zounds
good
people
he
cried
what
fearful
calamity
has
overtaken
your
offspring
absolutely
nothing

my
father
compared
to
what

to
overtake
them
as
soon
as

rosalee
the
prettiest
thing
that
we
ever
seen
not
just
the
prettiest
i
explained
but
the
most
preciousest
so
we
thought
we
shut
our
eyes
said
rosalee
all
the
way
home
and
find
out
what
sight
it
was
that
we
missed
the
most
i
think
it
is
said
rosalee
and
all
the
pretty
flickering
little
shadows
and
the
way
the
slender
white
church
spire
flares
through
the
poplar
trees
oh
i
shall
make
up
a
picture
about
said
rosalee
oh
sh
h
said
my
mother
you
must
tell
each
other
what
you
decide
that
would
take
half
the
fun
and
the
surprise
out
of
the
competition
would
it
said
rosalee
would
it
she
turned
to
the
old
doctor
she
slipped
into
the
curve
of
his
arm
the
curve
of
his
arm
seemed
to
be
all
ready
for
her
she
reached
up
and
patted
his
face
you
old
darling
she
said
in
all
the
world
what
is
the
most
beautiful
est
sight
that
have
ever
seen
the
old
doctor
gave
an
awful
swallow
he
said
oh
youth
said
my
father
how
ever
would
one
make
a
picture
of
all
arms
and
legs
and
wild
ideas
believe
me
that
if
i
ever
once
get
wild
ideas
and
legs
and
arms
home
there
will
be
we
never
heard
what
there
would
be
we
bumped
into
the
man
instead
and
had
to
tell
all
about
it
nobody
kissed
the
man
he
smelt
of
mice
and
crackers
we
talked
to
him
just
as
we
would
have
talked
to
sugar
or
potatoes
man
we
said
you
are
very
wise
you
have
a
store
and
a
wagon
and
a
big
iron
safe
and
besides
in
all
the
world
what
is
the
most
beautifulest
thing
that
you
have
ever
seen
the
man
did
have
to
worry
about
it
at
all
he
never
even
swallowed
the
instant
he
crossed
his
hands
on
his
white
linen
stomach
he
my
bank
book
he
said
my
father
laughed
you
naughty
children
said
my
father
i
trust
you
be
satisfied
to
proceed
home
with
your
eyes
open
but
my
mother
said
no
matter
how
naughty
we
were
we
could
go
home
without
buying
at
the
stand
so
we
had
to
tell
the
man
all
about
it
too
the
man
was
very
little
he
looked
like
a
pirate
he
had
black
eyes
he
had
gold
rings
through
his
ears
we
loved
him
a
good
deal
in
all
the
world
we
asked
the
man
what
is
the
most
beautiful
est
sight
that
you
have
ever
seen
it
took
the
man
an
awful
long
time
to
think
it
took
him
so
long
that
while
he
was
thinking
he
filled
our
paper
bags
till
they
busted
it
was
a
nice
bustedness

my
mother
laughed
to
see
us

my
father
laughed
a
little
we
thought
about
the
peacock
as
we
ran
we
thought
quite
a
little
about
the
we
wished
we
had
a
peacock
we
hoped
we
had
a
our
home
looked
nice
it
was
as
though
we
had
seen
it
for
a
long
while
it
was
as
though
we
had
seen
anything
for
a
long
while
the
garden
did
look
like
just
a
garden
any
more
it
looked
like
a
carol
tame
crow
came
hopping
up
the
gravel
walk
we
remembered
that
he
was
so
black
the
sun
through
the
kitchen
window
was
real
gold
there
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
said
rosalee
in
a
world
so
full
of
beautiful
things
however
shall
we
choose
what
to
tell
the
blinded
lady
carol
ran
to
the
desk
he
took
a
pencil
he
took
a
paper
he
slashed
the
words
down
he
held
it
out
for
us
to
see
i
know
what
i
going
to

said
the
words
he
took
his
pencil
he
ran
away
rosalee
took
her

she
ran
away
over
her
shoulder
she
called

what
she
called

oh

i

what

i
took
my
father
pencil
i
ran
away
i
did
run
very
far
i
found
a
basket
instead
it
was
a
pretty
basket
i
made
a
nest
for
the
white
kitten
in
case
i
should
win
it
i
lined
the
nest
with
green
moss
there
was
a
lot
of
sunshine
in
the
moss
and
little
blue
flowers
i
forgot
to
come
home
for
supper
that
how
i
chose
what
i
was
going
to
write
when
we
woke
up
the
next
morning
we
all
felt
very
busy
it
made
the
day
seem
funny
it
made
every
day
that
happened
seem
funny
every
day
somebody
took
somebody
pencil
and
ran
away
my
mother
could
find
anything
not
children
not
pencils
rosalee
took
the
dictionary
book
besides
anybody
think
said
my
father
that
this
was
a
graduation
essay
you
were
making
instead
of
just
a
simple
little
for
a
blinded
lady
said
rosalee
what
i
trying
to
make
is
a
peacock
feather
fan
i
wish
there
were
three
prizes
instead
of
two
said
my
mother
why
said
my
father
carol
came
and
kicked
his
feet
on
the
door
his
hands
were
full
of
stones
he
wanted
a
drink
of
water
all
day
long
when
he
was
sitting
under
the
old
larch
tree
with
a
pencil
in
his
mouth
he
was
carrying
stones
and
kicking
his
feet
on
the
door
and
asking
for
a
drink
of
water
whatever
in
the
world
said
my
mother
are
you
doing
with
all
those
stones
carol
nodded
his
head
that
i
could
tell
he
building
something
i
said
out
behind
the
barn
i
do
know
what
it
is
carol
dropped
his
stones
he
took
a
piece
of
chalk
he
knelt
down
on
the
kitchen
floor
he
wrote
big
white
letters
on
the
floor
it
an
ar
rena
is
what
he
wrote
an
arena
said
my
mother
an
she
looked
quite
sorry
oh
laddie
she
said
i
did
so
want
you
to
win
a
prize
you
have
kept
your
mind
on
it
just
a
day
or
two
longer
it
was
the
longest
week
i
ever
knew
it
got
longer
every
day
thursday
was
twice
as
long
as
wednesday
i
do
seem
to
remember
about
friday
but
saturday
came
so
early
in
the
morning
i
was
even
awake
when
my
mother
called
me
we
went
to
the
blinded
lady
house
right
after
dinner
we
could
wait
any
longer
the
blinded
lady
pretended
she
was
surprised
to
see
us
mercy
me
she
said
what
have
these
children
come
again
muddy
feet
chatter
and
all
she
thumped
her
cane
she
rocked
her
chair
she
billowed
her
skirts
we
were
frightened
a
bit
we
sat
on
the
edge
of
our
chairs
and
laughed
and
laughed
there
was
a
little
white
table
spread
with
cookies
there
were
great
crackly
glasses
of
raspberry
vinegar
and
ice
old
mary
had
on
a
white
apron
that
why
we
laughed
we
we
were
expected
my
father
explained
it
to
everybody
as
long
as
carol
could
speak
his
piece
he
said
it
did
seem
fair
that
any
of
the
children
should
speak
so
the
children
have
all
written
their
pieces
to
read
aloud
and
but
as
long
as
carol
was
able
to
read
his
aloud
cried
my
mother
it
did
seem
fair
that
any
of
should
read
theirs
aloud
so
the
children
father
is
going
to
read
and
without
giving
any
clue
of
course
said
my
father
as
to
which
child
wrote
which
so
that
you
wo
be
unduly
influenced
at
all
in
any
way
by
hair
for
instance
or
freckles
or
said
my
mother
said
the
blinded
lady
understanding
of
course
said
my
father
that
we
ourselves
have
not
seen
the
papers
yet
nor
assisted
in
any
way
with
the
choice
of
subject
said
my
mother
nor
with
the
treatment
of
it
said
the
blinded
lady
i
will
now
proceed
to
read
said
my
father
so
do
said
the
blinded
lady
my
father
so
did
he
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
he
cleared
his
throat
he
put
on
his
he
looked
a
little
surprised
the
first
one
he
said
seems
to
be
about
said
the
blinded
lady
said
my
father
read
it
said
the
blinded
lady
i
will
said
my
father
is
very
handsome
it
so
brown
and
every
time
you
eat
a
piece
you
have
to
have
another
that
shows
its
worth
as
well
as
its
handsomeness
and
besides
you
can
smell
it
a
long
way
off
when
you
coming
home
especially
when
you
coming
home
from
school
it
has
molasses
in
it
too
and
that
very
instructive
as
well
as
ginger
and
other
spices
the
geography
is
full
of
them
molasses
comes
from
new
orleans
spices
come
from
asia
except
jamaica
ginger
comes
from
drug
stores
there
are
eggs
in
too
and
that
natural
history
and
very
important
they
have
to
be
hen
eggs
i
think
i
had
some
guineas
once
and
they
looked
like
chipmunks
when
they
hatched
you
ca
make
out
of
anything
that
looks
like
chipmunks
it
takes
three
eggs
to
make
and
one
cupful
of
sugar
and
some
baking
soda
and
oh
tush
said
the
blinded
lady
that
is
a
picture
it
a
recipe
read
another
dear
me
dear
me
said
my
mother
now
some
child
is
suffering
she
looked
all
around
to
see
which
child
it
was
carol
kicked
rosalee
rosalee
kicked
me
i
kicked
carol
we
all
looked
just
as
queer
as
we
could
outside
read
thumped
the
blinded
lady
my
father
read
on
this
next
one
he
said
seems
to
be
about
soldiers
soldiers
said
the
blinded
lady
soldiers
she
sat
up
very
straight
she
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
read
it
she
said
i
reading
it
said
my
father
the
most
scrumptious
sight
i
ever
seen
in
my
life
is
soldiers
marching
i
saw
them
once
in
new
york
it
was
all
the
reds
and
the
blues
and
the
browns
of
the
uniforms
and
when
the
band
played
all
the
different
instruments
it
seemed
as
though
it
was
really
and
music
they
were
playing
it
makes
you
feel
so
brave
and
so
unselfish
but
most
of
all
it
makes
you
wish
you
were
a
pony
with
diamond
hoofs
so
that
you
could
and
and
and
just
for
fun
and
and
and
down
clattery
streets
and
through
black
woods
and
across
green
pastures
till
you
met
more
soldiers
and
more
bands
and
more
gold
and
silver
music
so
that
you
could
and
and
and
all
over
again
with
said
the
blinded
lady
that
pretty
and
spirited
too
but
but
it
does
exactly
warm
the
and
no
one
but
a
boy
anyway

to
think
about
soldiers
every
read

cleared
his

and
put

seen
in
all

cried
my

of
his
glasses

smiled

said
w
what
stammered
my
mother
my
father
cleared
his
throat
and
began
all
over
again
the
most
beautifulest
thing
i
ever
seen
in
all
my
life
is
my
mother
face
it
so
pleasant
it
tries
to
make
everything
so
pleasant
when
you
go
away
it
smiles
you
away
when
you
come
home
it
smiles
you

when
you

soft
hair
all
full
of
little
curls
it
has
brown
eyes

the
ears

has
a
little
hat
the
jolliest
little
hat
all
trimmed
with

teeny
pink
roses
and
there
a
silver
ribbon
on
it
and
my
mother
had
a
hat

cried
the
blinded
lady

said
my
mother

face
still
looked
pretty
queer
and
surprised
the
blinded
lady
perked
way
forward
in
her
chair

seemed
all
out
of
breath
she
talked
so
fast
it
almost
choked
her
yes

like
that
cried
the
blinded
lady
my
mother
bought
it
in
boston

father
thought
it
was
an
awful
price
she
wore
it
with
a
lavender
dress
all
sprigged
with
yellow
leaves
she
looked
like
an
angel
in
it
she
an
angel
hair
was
brown
too
i
have
thought
of
it
for
ages
and
all
full
of
little
curls
she
had
the
kindest
smile
the
minister
said
it
was
worth
any
two
of
his
sermons
and
when
folks
were
sick
she
went
anywhere
to
help
them
she
went
twenty
miles
once
we
drove
the
old
white
horse
i
can
see
it
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
faces
at
the
window
waving
my
father
cautioning
us
through
his
long
gray
beard
not
to

little
but

about

battered
ears
at
his
scarred
nose
at
his
twisted
eye
the
old
tom

at

my
father

the
fields
instead

the
village
carol
held
the
peacock
feather

as
though
he
was
afraid
it
would
bite
him

the
old
tom
as
though
she
it
would
bite
her
when
we
got
to
the
willow
tree
they
changed
prizes
it
made
a
difference
rosalee
carried
the
peacock
feather
as
though
it
was
a
magic
sail
she
tipped
it
to
the
breeze
she
pranced
it
and
danced
it
it
looked
fluffy
carol
carried
the
old
tom
hugged
tight
to
his
breast
the
old
tom
looked
historical
carol
looked
very
shining
and
pure
he
looked
like
a
carrying
his
singing
book
he
looked
as
though
his
voice
would
be
very
high
my
father
and
mother
carried
each
other
hands
they
laughed
very
softly
to
themselves
as
though
they
knew
pleasant
things
that
no
one
else
knew
hand
would
have
felt
pretty
lonely
if
i
had
had
the
little
gold
pencil
to
carry
i
felt
pretty
tired
i
walked
pretty
far
behind
i
decided
that
when
i
grew
up
i
be
a
writer
so
that
no
matter
what
happened
i
always
have
a
gold
pencil
in
my
hand
and
be
lonely
the
gift
of
the
probable
places
my
mother
says
that
everybody
in
the
world
has
got
some
special
gift
some
people
have
one
kind
and
some
have
another
i
got
my
skates
and
last
spring
when
i
was
nine
always
had
my
freckles
my
brother
carol
gift
is
being
dumb
no
matter
what
anybody
says
to
him
he
does
have
to
answer
there
was
an
old
man
in
our
town
named
old
man
smith
old
man
smith
had
a
wonderful
gift
it
was
a
christmas
gift
like
toys
and
games
it
was
a
birthday
gift
all
stockings
and
handkerchiefs
it
was
the
of
finding
he
called
it
the
gift
of
the
probable
places
most
any
time
when
you
lost
anything
he
could
find
it
for
you
he
find
it
by
floating
a
few
in
a
cup
or
by
trying
to
match
cards
or
by
fooling
with
silly
things
like
ghosts
he
did
even
find
it
with
his
legs
he
found
it
with
his
head
he
found
it
by
thinking
very
hard
with
his
head
people
came
from
miles
around
to
borrow
his
head
he
always
charged
everybody
just
the
same
no
matter
what
it
was
that
they
lost
one
dollar
was
what
he
charged
it
was
just
as
much
trouble
to
him
he
said
to
think
about
a
thimble
that
was
lost
as
it
was
to
think
about
an
elephant
that
was
i
never
knew
anybody
who
lost
an
elephant
when
the
post
master
wife
lost
her
diamond
ring
she
hunted
more
than
a
hundred
places
for
it
she
was
most
distracted
she
thought
somebody
had
stolen
it
from
her
she
hunted
it
in
all
the
newspapers
she
hunted
it
in
all
the
stores
she
hunted
it
all
up
and
down
the
village
streets
she
hunted
it
in
the
depot
carriage
she
hunted
it
in
the
hired
trunk
miles
and
miles
and
miles
she
must
have
hunted
it
with
her
hands
and
with
her
feet
but
old
man
smith
found
it
for
her
without
budging
an
inch
from
his
just
with
his
head
alone
he
found
it
just
by
asking
her
a
question
that
made
her
mad
he
found
it
the
question
that
made
her
mad
was
about
her
baptismal
her
baptismal
name
was
mehetabelle
euphemia
however
in
the
world
said
old
man
smith
did
you
get
such
a
perfectly
hideous
name
as
mehetabelle
euphemia
the
post
master
wife
was
madder
than
scat
she
wrung
her
hands
she
snapped
her
thumbs
she
crackled
her
never
she
said
had
she
been
so
insulted
exactly
what
i
thought
said
old
man
smith
now
just
when
if
you
can
remember
was
the
last
time
that
you
felt
you
never
been
so
insulted
before
insulted
screamed
the
post
master
wife
why
i
have
been
so
insulted
as
this
since
two
weeks
ago
last
saturday
when
i
was
out
in
my
back
yard
under
the
mulberry
tree
dyeing
my
old
white
dress
and
the
druggist
wife
came
along
and
asked
me
if
i
did
think
i
was
just
a
little
bit
too
old
to
be
wearing
old
me
screamed
the
post
master
wife
said
old
man
smith
pink
you
say
pink
a
little
powdered
cochineal
i
suppose
and
a
bit
of
cream
o
tartar
and
more
than
a
bit
of
alum
it
a
pretty
likely
combination
to
make
the
fingers
and
a
lady
what
crackles
her
so
every
time
she
mad
and
snaps
her
thumbs
and
yes
under
the
mulberry
tree
is
a
probable
one
dollar
please
said
old
man
smith
and
when
the
grocer
nephew
got
suspended
from
college
for
sitting
up
too
late
at
night
and
getting
headaches
and
came
to
spend
a
month
with
his
uncle
and
could
find
his
green
plaid
overcoat
when
it
was
time
to
go
home
he
was
perfectly
positive
that
somebody
had
borrowed
it
from
the
store
or
that
he
dropped
it
out
of
the
delivery
wagon
working
or
that
he
left
it
at
the
high
school
social
but
old
man
smith
found
it
for
him
just
by
glancing
at
his
purple
socks
and
his
plaid
necktie
and
his
plush
waistcoat
oh
yes
of
course
it
perfectly
possible
said
old
man
smith
that
you
dropped
it
from
the
basket
of
a
balloon
on
your
way
to
a
missionary
but
have
you
looked
in
the
young
widow
gayette
back
hall
three
pegs
from
the
door
where
the
shadows
are
fairly
private
one
dollar
please
said
old
man
smith
and
when
the
old
preacher
lost
the
hymn
book
that
george
washington
had
given
his
grandfather
everybody
started
to
take
up
the
floor
of
the
church
to
see
if
it
had
fallen
down
through
a
crack
in
the
pulpit
but
old
man
smith
sent
a
boy
running
to
beg
not
to
tear
down
the
church
till
they
looked
in
the
old
lawyer
pantry
the
second
shelf
between
the
ice
chest
and
the
cheese
crock
sunday
evening
after
meeting
was
rather
a
lean
time
with
old
preachers
he
said
he
always
and
old
lawyers
was
noted
for
their
fat
and
there
were
certain
things
about
cheese
somehow
that
seemed
to
be
soothin
to
the
memory
why
how
perfectly
extraordinary
said
everybody
one
dollar
please
said
old
man
smith
again
and
when
little
tommy
bent
ran
away
to
the
city
his
mother
hunted
all
the
hospitals
for
him
and
made
drag
the
river
and
wore
a
long
black
veil
all
the
time
and
howled
but
old
man
smith
said
oh
shucks
it
ai
at
all
probable
is
it
that
he
was
aimin
at
hospitals
or
rivers
when
he
went
away
what
the
use
of
worryin
over
the
things
he
aimin
at
till
investigated
the
things
he
aimin
at
sobbed
mrs
bent
aimin
at
who
in
the
world
could
ever
tell
what
any
little
boy
was
aimin
at
and
there
something
in
that
too
said
old
man
smith
what
did
he
look
like
like
his
father
said
mrs
bent
plain
you
mean
said
old
man
smith
he
was
only
nine
years
old
sobbed
mrs
bent
but
he
did
love
meetings
so
no
matter
what
they
was
about
he
was
always
hunting
for
some
new
meetings
to
go
to
he
just
seemed
naturally
to
dote
hisself
on
any
crowd
of
people
that
was
all
facing
the
other
way
looking
at
somebody
else
he
had
a
little
cowlick
at
the
back
of
his
neck
sobbed
mrs
bent
it
was
a
comical
little
cowlick
people
used
to
laugh
at
it
he
never
liked
to
sit
any
place
where
there
was
anybody
sitting
behind
him
now
you
talking
said
old
man
smith
will
he
answer
to
the
name
of
tommy
bent
he
will
not
said
mrs
bent
he
that
stubborn
he
exactly
like
his
father
old
man
smith
wrote
an
entirely
new
advertisement
to
put
in
the
papers
it
did
say
anything
about
rivers
or
hospitals
or
or
alive
it
just
said
lost
in
the
back
seat
of
most
any
meeting
a
very
plain
little
boy
will
answer
to
the
name
of
little
tommy
bent
stubborn
like
his
father
we
put
that
in
about
being
said
old
man
smith
because
it
sounds
quaint
and
will
interest
people
it
wo
interest
mr
bent
sobbed
mrs
bent
and
it
seems
awful
cruel
to
make
it
so
public
about
the
child
being
plain
old
man
smith
spoke
coldly
to
her
would
you
rather
lose
him
handsome
he
said
or
find
him
mrs
bent
seemed
to
think
that
she
rather
find
him
plain
she
found
him
within
two
days
he
was
awful
plain
his
shoes
were
all
worn
out
and
his
stomach
was
flat
he
was
at
a
meeting
of
men
who
sell
bicycles
to
china
the
men
were
feeling
pretty
sick
they
sent
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
to
china
and
the
chinamen
ride
on
account
of
their
skirts
it
was
the
smell
of
an
apple
in
a
man
pocket
that
made
tommy
bent
follow
the
man
to
the
and
he
answered
to
every
name
except
bent
so
they
knew
it
was
he
mercy
what
this
experience
has
cost
me
sobbed
mrs
bent
one
dollar
please
said
old
man
smith
it
a
perfect
miracle
said
everybody
it
neither
said
old
man
smith
it
plain
hoss
sense
there
laws
about
findin
things
same
as
there
is
about
losin
things
has
got
regular
habits
and
haunts
same
as
folks
and
folks
has
got
regular
haunts
and
habits
same
as
birds
and
beasts
it
ai
the
possible
places
that
i
arguin
about
the
world
is
full
of
but
the
can
be
reckoned
most
any
time
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
that
the
trouble
with
folks
they
always
themselves
out
on
the
possible
places
and
never
gettin
round
at
all
to
the
ones
now
it
perfectly
possible
of
course
said
old
man
smith
that
you
might
find
a
trout
in
a
or
a
hummin
bird
in
an
aquarium
or
meet
a
panther
in
your
mother
parlor
but
the
chances
are
said
old
man
smith
that
if
you
really
set
out
to
organize
a
troutin
expedition
or
a
hummin
bird
collection
or
a
panther
hunt
you
would
look
in
the
dust
pan
or
the
aquarium
or
your
mother
parlor
when
you
lose
something
that
no
then
i
sure
stumped
said
old
man
smith
but
when
annie
halliway
lost
her
everybody
in
the
village
was
stumped
about
it
and
everything
was
all
mixed
up
it
was
annie
halliway
mother
and
annie
halliway
father
and
annie
uncles
and
aunts
and
cousins
and
friends
who
did
all
the
worrying
about
it
while
annie
halliway
herself
did
seem
to
care
at
all
but
just
sat
braiding
things
into
her
hair
some
people
said
it
was
a
railroad
accident
that
she
lost
her
mind
in
some
said
it
was
because
she
studied
too
hard
in
europe
some
said
it
was
an
earthquake
everybody
said
something
annie
halliway
father
and
mother
were
awful
rich
they
brought
her
home
in
a
great
big
ship
and
gave
her
twelve
new
dresses
and
the
front
parlor
and
a
brown
piano
but
she
would
stay
in
any
of
them
all
she
stay
in
was
a
little
old
blue
silk
dress
she
had
before
she
went
away
carol
and
i
got
excused
from
school
one
day
because
we
were
afraid
our
heads
might
ache
and
went
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
it
seemed
to
be
about
a
great
many
things
but
after
we
walked
all
around
annie
halliway
twice
and
looked
at
her
all
we
could
and
asked
how
old
she
was
and
found
out
that
she
was
nineteen
we
felt
suddenly
very
glad
about
we
felt
suddenly
very
glad
that
if
she
really
was
obliged
to
lose
anything
out
of
her
face
it
was
her
that
she
lost
instead
of
her
eyes
or
her
nose
or
her
red
red
mouth
or
her
cunning
little
ears
was
so
pretty
she
seemed
to
like
us
very
much
too
she
asked
us
to
come
again
we
said
we
would
we
did
we
went
every
saturday
afternoon
they
let
us
take
her
to
walk
if
we
were
careful
we
did
walk
her
in
the
village
because
her
hair
looked
so
funny
we
walked
her
in
the
pleasant
fields
we
gathered
flowers
we
gathered
ferns
we
explored
birds
we
built
little
gurgling
harbors
in
the
corners
of
the
brook
sometimes
we
climbed
hills
and
looked
off
annie
halliway
seemed
to
like
to
climb
hills
and
look
off
it
was
the
day
we
climbed
the
sumac
hill
that
we
got
our
idea
it
was
a
nice
day
annie
halliway
wore
her
blue
dress
and
her
blue
scarf
her
hair
hung
down
like
two
long
loose
black
ropes
across
her
shoulders
blue
larkspur
was
braided
into
her
hair
and
a
little
tin
trumpet
tied
with
blue
ribbon
and
a
blue
japanese
fan
and
a
blue
lead
pencil
and
a
blue
silk
stocking
and
a
basket
she
looked
like
a
summer
christmas
tree
it
was
pretty
there
were
lots
of
clouds
in
the
sky
they
seemed
very
near
it
sort
of
puckered
your
nose
smell
the
clouds
said
annie
halliway
somebody
had
cut
down
a
tree
that
used
to
be
there
it
made
a
lonely
hole
in
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
the
sky
through
the
lonely
hole
in
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
the
sky
you
could
see
miles
and
miles
way
down
in
the
valley
a
bright
light
glinted
it
was
as
though
the
whole
sun
was
trying
to
bore
a
hole
in
a
tiny
bit
of
glass
and
could
do
it
annie
halliway
stretched
out
her
arms
towards
the
glint
and
started
for
it
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
we
knew
where
the
glint
was
it
was
old
man
smith
house
old
man
smith
house
was
built
of
tea
cups
and
broken
tumblers
and
bits
of
plates
first
of
all
of
course
it
was
built
of
clay
or
mud
or
something
soft
and
loose
like
that
and
while
it
was
still
soft
he
had
stuck
it
all
full
of
people
broken
dishes
so
that
wherever
you
went
most
all
day
long
the
sun
was
trying
to
bore
a
hole
in
it
and
could
do
it
it
seemed
to
be
the
glint
that
annie
halliway
wanted
she
thought
it
was
something
new
to
braid
in
her
hair
i
guess
she
kept
right
on
walking
towards
it
with
her
arms
stretched
out
carol
kept
right
on
looking
at
me
his
mouth
was
all
turned
white
sometimes
when
people
to
me
i
ca
understand
at
all
what
they
mean
but
when
carol
looks
at
me
with
his
mouth
all
turned
white
i
always
know
just
exactly
what
he
means
it
made
my
own
mouth
feel
pretty
white
we
shall
be
punished
i
said
we
surely
be
punished
if
we
do
it
my
brother
carol
smiled
it
was
quite
a
white
smile
he
put
out
his
hand
i
took
it
we
ran
down
the
hill
after
young
annie
halliway
and
led
her
to
the
glint
old
man
smith
was
pretty
surprised
to
see
us
he
was
riding
round
the
in
his
wheel
chair
he
rolled
his
chair
to
the
gate
to
meet
us
the
chair
squeaked
a
good
deal
but
even
if
he
wanted
to
walk
he
could
the
reason
why
he
could
is
because
he
dumb
in
his
legs
what
in
the
world
do
you
want
he
asked
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
he
kicked
me
in
the
shins
my
thoughts
came
very
quickly
we
brought
you
a
young
lady
that
lost
her
mind
i
said
what
can
you
do
about
it

happened
all
at
once
that
made
our
legs
feel
queer

that
old
man

did
seem
pleased

all
about

snatched
his
long
white
beard

his
hands

her
mind
he
said
her

cried
we
at
all
i
explained
on
account
of
the
bears

read
all
about
the
mocking
bears
in
a
book
he
seemed
to
feel
better
you
mean
in
the
good
book
he
said
the
elijah
bears
you
mean
well
it
was
a
good
book

down
on
the
ground
at
old
man
feet
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
old
man
smith

looked
holy
but
all
the
time
that
she
looked
so
holy
she
kept
right
on
braiding
the
handle
of
the
blue
china
cup
into
her

cranked
against
the
tin
trumpet

like

made
a
little
chuckle
in
his
throat

began
to
look
at
young
annie
halliway
all
over
again
and
what
does

mother

pointed

annie
halliway
picked
up
the

outer
walls
of
my
house
when

on
that
bit
of
glass
on
this
bit
of
crockles
the
edge
of
a
plate
the
rim
of
a
tumbler
i
read
about
folk
minds
what
they
loved
what
they
hated
what
they
was
thinking
of
instead
when
it
broke
he
snatched
his
long
white
beard
in
his

a
box

was
full
of
pieces
of
colored
glass
and
of
china

juggled
them
in
his
hands
they
looked
gay

they
were
and
green
and
white
and
yellow
and
blue
he
snatched
out
all
the
blue
ones
and
hid
quick
in
his
pocket
she
seems
sort
of
partial
to
blue
he
said
there
was
one
funny
big
piece
of
glass
that
was
awful
shiny
when
he
held
it
up
to
the
light
it
glinted
and
glowed
all
sorts
of
colors
it
made
your
eyes
feel
very
calm
annie
halliway
reached
out
her
hand
for
it
she
did
say
a
word
she
just
stared
at
it
with
her
hand
all
reached
out
but
old
man
smith
did
give
it
to
her
he
just
sat
and
stared
at
her
eyes
her
eyes
never
moved
from
the
shining
bit
of
glass
they
looked
awful
funny
bigger
and
bigger
they
got
and
rounder
and
rounder
and
stiller
and
stiller
it
was
like
a
pointing
a
little
bird
in
the
grass
it
made
you
feel
queer
it
made
you
feel
all
sort
of
hollow
inside
it
made
your
legs
wobble
carol
mouth
was
wide
open
so
was
old
man
smith
old
man
smith
reached
out
suddenly
and
put
the
shining
bit
of
glass
right
into
annie
halliway
hand
it
fell
through
her
fingers
but
her
hand
stayed
just
where
it
was
reaching
out
into
the
air
put
down
your
arm
said
old
man
smith
annie
halliway
put
it
down
her
eyes
were
still
staring
very
wide
look
said
old
man
smith
look
he
dropped
several
pieces
of
colored
glass
china
into
her
lap
she
chose
the
handle
of
a
red
tea
cup
and
a
little
chunk
of
yellow
crockery
she
stared
and
stared
at
them
but
all
the
time
it
was
as
though
her
eyes
did
see
them
all
the
time
it
was
as
though
she
was
looking
at
something
very
far
away
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
began
to
jingle
them
together
in
her
hand
the
little
piece
of
red
china
and
the
chunk
of
yellow
bowl
and
swing
her
shoulders
and
stamp
her
foot
it
looked
like
dancing
it
sounded
like
clappers
oh
ho

spain
she
laughed
old
man
smith
snatched
all
the
blue
pieces
of
china
and
glass
out
of
his
pocket
again
and
tossed
them
into
her
lap
he
looked
sort
of
mad
spain
he
said
spain

the
old
harry

a
handful
of
glass
and
china
got
to
do
with
spain
harry
said
annie
halliway
old
harry
her
eyes
looked
wider
and
blinder
every
minute
it
was
as
though
everything
in
her
was
wide
awake
except
the
thing
she
was
thinking
about
har
ry
she
puzzled
harry
she
dropped
the
red
and
yellow
china
from
her
hand
and
picked
up
a
piece
of
blue
glass
and
offered
it
to
old
man
smith
why
is
harry
she
said
she
reached
for
the
that
had
the
blue
larkspur
braided
into
it
she
pointed
to
the
that
had
the
blue
fan
braided
into
it
why
is
harry
she
said
she
made
a
little
sob
in
her
throat
old
man
smith
jingled
his
hands
at
her
there
there
there
my
pretty
he
said
never
mind
never

he
opened
his
hands
there
were
some
little
pieces
of
plain
glass
in
his
hands
little
round
knobs
like
beads
they
were
very
shining
they
made
a
nice
jingle
when
annie
halliway
saw
them
she
screamed
and
snatched
them
in
her
hand
and
threw
them
away
just
as
far
as
she
could
all
over
the
grass
she
threw
them
i
will
not
she
screamed
will
not
i
will
not
her
tears
were
awful
when
she
got
through
screaming
her
face
looked
like
a
wet
cloth
that
had
everything
else
wrung
out
of
it
except
shadows
where
is
harry
said
old
man
smith
he
said
it
very
slowly
and
then
all
over
again
where
is
harry
you
would
have
not
tell
him
if
you
known
annie
halliway
started
to
pick
up
some
blue
glass
again
then
she
stopped
and
looked
all
around
her
it
was
a
jerky
stop
her
jaw
sort
of
dropped
harry
is
in
prison
she
said
even
though
she
said
it
herself
she
seemed
to
be
awfully
surprised
at
the
news
she
shook
and
shook
her
head
as
though
she
was
trying
to
wake
up
the
idea
that
was
asleep
her
eyes
were
all
scrunched
up
now
with
trying
to
remember
about
it
she
dragged
the
back
of
her
hands
across
her
forehead
first
one
hand
and
then
the
other
she
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
again
and
looked
at
old
man
smith
where

the
night

crossed
the
border
from
france
to
spain

said
her
voice

very
funny
and
far
away
it
sounded
like

a
lesson

a
teacher
from
the
paris
art
school

recited

could

had
braided
old
man

and
his
wheel
chair
into
her

when

out
over
behind

lilac
bush

the
strange
gentleman
was
some
special
kind
of
a
doctor

special
doctor
kept
saying
to
everybody

is
a
very
crucial
moment

crucial
moment
he
pointed
to
annie

on
the
grass
her

hard
to

old

mother
annie
annie
annie
halliway
opened
her
eyes
very
slowly
and
looked
up
it
was
a
brand
new
kind
of
a
look
it
had
a
bottom
to
it
instead
of
being
just
through
and
through
and
through
there
was
a
little
smile
in
it
too
it
was
a
pretty
look
why
mother
said
annie
halliway
where

i
the
special
man
from
new
york
made
a
queer
little
sound
in
his
throat

right
it
seemed
pretty
quick
to
me
you

cured
now
not
said
the
special
man
from
new
york
no

old
man
smith
the
special
man
from
new
york
began
to
laugh
but
annie
halliway
mother
began
to
cry
oh
just
suppose
we
never
found
her
she
cried
she
looked
at
carol
she
looked
at
me
she
glared
a
little
but
not
so
awfully
much
when
you
naughty
children
ran
away
with
her
she
cried
and
we
find
her
anywhere
and
the
doctor
came
and
there
was
only
an
hour
to
spare
and
we
got
a
horse
and
drove
round
anywhere
and
and
i
would
have
missed
it
for
anything

the
special
man
from
new
york
and
all
your
appointments
waiting
cried
annie
halliway
mother

the
special
man
from
new
york
he
slanted
his
head
and
looked
at
old
man
smith
we
arrived
he
said
just
at
the
moment
when
the
young
lady
was
gazing
so
so
intently
at
the
piece
of
shiny
glass
he
made
a
funny
grunt
in
his
throat
let
me
congratulate
you
mr
smith
he
said
your
treatment
was
most
efficient
your
hypnosis
was
perfect
your
hip
said
old
man
smith
of
course
in
a
case
like
this
said
the
special
man
from
new
york
the
power
of
suggestion
is
always
all
young
folks
said
old
man
smith
are
cases
of
one
kind
or
another
and
the
most
powerful
suggestion
that
i
can
make
is
that
somebody
find
said
annie
halliway
mother
why
i
got
four
letters
at
home
for
annie
in
my
desk
now
from
some
im
impetuous
young
man
who
signs
himself
he
seems
to
be
in
an
architect
office
in
paris
is
what
he
calls
annie
robin
eh
said
annie
halliway
what
she
sat
bolt
upright
she
scrambled
to
her
feet
she
started
for
the
carriage
her
mother
had
to
run
to
catch
her
the
special
man
from
new
york
followed
them
just
as
fast
as
he
could
old
man
smith
wheeled
his
chair
to
the
gate
to
say
everything
seemed
all
mixed
up
annie
halliway
mother
never
stopped
talking
a
single
second
oh
my
pet
she
cried
my
precious
my
treasure
with
one
foot
on
the
carriage
step
the
special
man
from
new
york
turned
round
and
looked
at
old
man
smith
he
smiled
a
funny
little
smile

and
ye
shall
find
he
said
that
is
if
you
only
know
and
to
seek
old
man
smith
began
to
chuckle
in
his
beard
yes
i
admit
that
quite
a
help
he
said
the
knowing
and
but
before
you
set
out
seekin
very
hard
for
anything
lost
it
a
pretty
good
idea
to
find
out
first
just
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
seekin
for
when
a
young
lady
lost
her
for
instance
that
one
thing
but
if
it
her
that
lost
why
that
of
course
is
quite
another
annie
halliway
face
was
white
any
more
it
was
as
red
as
roses
she
had
it
in
her
mother
shoulder
the
horses
began
to
prance
the
carriage
began
to
creak
annie
halliway
mother
looked
all
around
oh

oh
dear
oh
dear
smith
she
said
how
shall
i
ever
repay
you
old
man
smith
reached
out
his
hand
across
the
fence
there
was
sort
of
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
one
dollar
please
said
old
man
smith
the
book
of
the
funny
smells
and
everything
it
was
carol
who
invented
the
book
he
did
mean
any
harm
i
helped
him
we
called
it
the
book
of
the
funny
smells
and
everything
it
was
one
tuesday
noon
coming
home
from
school
that
we
stopped
the
lady
on
the
street
she
was
a
very
interesting
looking
lady
she
looked
like
all
sorts
of
silk
roses
and
a
diamond
brooch
excuse
us
madam
i
said
but
we
are
making
a
book
and
we
have
decided
to
begin
it
with
you
if
you
were
a
beautiful
smell
instead
of
a
beautiful
lady
what
beautiful
smell
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
the
lady
reeled
back
against
the
wall
of
the
post
office
and
put
on
a
gold
eyeglass
to
support
her
merciful
impudences
she
said
what
new
kind
of
census
is
this
we
knew
what
a
census
was
no
it
is
that
at
all
i
explained
this
is
something
important
carol
showed
her
the
book
he
showed
her
the
pencil
he
was
going
to
write
the
book
with
when
it
all
done
i
explained
everybody
will
want
to
read
it
i
can
well
believe
it
said
the
lady
she
looked
at
carol
everybody
looks
at
carol
who
are
you
children
anyway
she
said
my
name
is
ruthy
i
explained
and
this
is
my
brother
carol
she
began
to
look
at
carol
all
over
again
she
reached
out
and
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
dumbness
she
said
why
let
sister
do
all
the
talking
my
stomach
felt
pretty
queer
my
brother
carol
talk
i
explained
he
dumb
the
lady
turned
very
red
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
said
she
opened
her
purse
she
took
out
a
dollar
bill
surely
something
could
be
done
about
it
she
said
we
are
not
looking
for
money
i
explained
we
are
perfectly
rich
we
have
warm
underalls
and
two
parents
and
an
older
sister
we
have
a
tame
coon
and
a
tame
crow
our
father
could
paint
the
house
any
autumn
he
wanted
to
if
he
rather
do
it
than
plant
tulips
the
lady
looked
at
her
watch
it
was
a
bright
blue
watch
no
bigger
than
a
violet
is
this
is
all
very
interesting
she
said
but
at
the
obnoxious
hotel
which
you
run
in
this
village
dinner
is
at
twelve
and
if
not
there
at
exactly
that
moment
there
will
not
be
another
dinner
i
suppose
until
twelve
the
next
day
so
probably
not
i
said
so
if
you
do
feel
timid
at
all
about
walking
out
with
strangers
my
brother
carol
and
i
will
walk
home
to
the
hotel
with
you
and
write
our
book
as
we
go
the
lady
bit
herself
she
bit
herself
in
the
lip
she
began
to
walk
very
fast
carol
walked
very
fast
on
one
side
of
her
i
walked
very
fast
on
the
other
carol
carried
the
book
he
carried
it
wide
open
so
as
to
be
all
ready
any
moment
i
carried
the
pencil
can
you
tell
me
said
the
lady
just
why
you
and
your
brother
have
picked
upon
me
as
the
first
victim
of
your
most
astonishing
interrogations
because
you
are
the
only
lady
we
ever
saw
in
our
lives
that
we
know
who
she
was
i
explained
and
that
makes
it
more
interesting
o
h
said
the
lady
she
gave
a
queer
little
gasp
it
was
the
hotel
happening
she
ran
up
the
hotel
steps
there
was
a
gentleman
waiting
for
her
at
the
top
of
the
steps
he
was
a
tall
gentleman
with
a
very
cross
mustache
the
lady
whispered
something
to
him
he
shook
his
mustache
at
us
get
out
of
here
you
young
scamps
he
cried
get
out
of
here
i
say
out
no
one
had
ever
shaken
his
mustache
at
us
before
we
sat
down
on
the
step
to
think
about
it
the
gentleman
ran
off
to
call
the
hotel
proprietor
the
lady
looked
a
little
sorry
she
came
running
back
she
stooped
down
she
took
the
book
from
carol
and
the
pencil
from
me
she
laughed
a
little
you
funny
funny
children
she
said
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
the
most
beautiful
smell
in
the
whole
wide
world
is
that
it
the
most
beautiful
smell
in
the
whole
wide
world
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
she
wrote
very
fast
her
cheeks
looked
pink
she
banged
the
book
together
just
the
first
second
she
had
finished
she
pulled
my
ear
i
i
sorry
she
said
oh
that
all
right
i
assured
her
we
be
round
and
write
the
rest
of
the
book
some
other
day
the
man
with
the
cross
mustache
kept
right
on
hunting
all
around
when
the
hotel
proprietor
came
running
and
saw
who
we
were
he
gave
us
two
oranges
instead
and
a
roll
of
with
parrots
on
it
and
all
the
old
calendars
that
were
in
his
desk
we
had
to
race
home
across
the
railroad
trestle
to
get
there
in
time
it
was
till
we
reached
the
blacksmith
shop
that
we
had
a
chance
to
stop
and
see
what
the
lady
had
written
in
our
book
there
was
a
smoke
tree
just
outside
the
blacksmith
shop
it
was
all
in
smoke
we
sat
down
under
it
and
opened
our
book
this
is
what
the
lady
had
written
in
our
book
the
most
beautiful
smell
in
the
world
is
the
smell
of
an
old
tattered
baseball
glove
that
been
lying
in
the
damp
grass
by
the
side
of
a
brook
in
june
time
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
we
felt
surprised
it
exactly
what
you
would
have
expected
carol
rolled
over
on
his
stomach
he
clapped
his
heels
in
the
air
he
pounded
his
fists
in
the
grass
we
forgot
all
about
going
home
we
went
into
the
blacksmith
shop
instead
it
was
a
very
earthy
place
but
nothing
grew
there
not
grass
not
flowers
not
even
vines
just
junk
the
blacksmith
name
was
jason
he
looked
something
like
a
stove
that
could
be
doubled
up
in
its
stomach
and
carried
round
to
all
four
corners
of
a
horse
for
the
horse
to
put
his
foot
on
he
was
making
shoes
for
a
very
stout
black
horse
the
horse
name
was
ezra
there
were
a
great
many
sparks
around
and
iron
noises
and
flames
and
smouches
hoofs
seemed
to
be
burning
it
smelt
so
funny
we
did
think
it
would
be
polite
to
ask
jason
what
he
rather
smell
like
instead
so
we
decided
to
begin
the
other
way
about
but
whatever
way
you
decided
you
had
to
scream
it
jason
i
screamed
if
you
were
a
beautiful
sound
instead
of
a
beautiful
blacksmith
what
beautiful
sound
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
screamed
jason
he
stopped
hammering
he
stopped
thumping
he
stopped
boiling
poor
ezra
hoof
with
a
red
hot
poker
he
said
all
over
again
well
that
a
new
one
on
me
what
the
big
idea
well
i
want
to
know
said
jason
he
sat
down
on
a
great
block
of
wood
he
wiped
his
sleeve
on
his
face
it
made
his
sleeve
all
black
if
i
was
a
sound
he
said
instead
of
a
man
instead
of
a
man
it
seemed
to
puzzle
him
a
good
deal
not
to
be
a
man
any
more
you
mean
no
arms
legs
stomach
eyes
to
get
all
worn
out
and
busted
stayin
on
forever
in
one
place
and
then
thrung
away
but
to
be
just
a
just
a
sound
just
a
sound
well
of
all
the
comical
ideas
of
all
the
then
quite
suddenly
he
whacked
his
hand
down
in
a
great
black
smouch
on
his
knee
and
clanged
his
feet
like
dungeon
chains
across
a
clutter
of
horseshoes
i
got
it
he
cried
i
got
it
if
i
was
a
sound
instead
of
a
man
i
choose
to
be
a
song
not
great
loud
i
mean
that
nobody
could
play
unless
he
was
hired
and
charged
tickets
but
some
nice
pretty
little
song
floatin
round
all
soft
and
easy
on
ladies
lips
and
in
men
hearts
or
tinklin
out
as
pleasant
as
you
please
on
moonlight
nights
from
mandolin
strings
and
young
folks
sparkin
or
turnin
up
just
as
likely
as
not
in
some
old
guy
whistle
on
the
top
of
one
of
these
omnibuses
in
london
town
or
even
in
a
phonograph
through
the
wonders
of
the
great
sahara
desert
something
all
simple
i
mean
that
you
could
hum
without
even
with
the
words
something
people
would
know
who
you
was
even
if
there
any
words
something
all
sweet
and
low
and
low
that
it
my
mother
used
to
sing
it
i
hai
thought
of
it
for
forty
years
the
one
i
mean
sweet
and
low
he
began
to
sing
sweet
and
low
sweet
and
low
wind
of
the
western
sea
his
voice
was
all
deep
and
full
of
sand
like
the
way
a
bass
drum
makes
you
feel
in
your
stomach
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
we
felt
pretty
surprised
jason
the
blacksmith
looked
more
surprised
than
anyone
but
he
kept
right
on
singing
over
the
rolling
waters
go
come
from
the
the
something
moon
and
blow
while
my
little
one
while
my
pretty
one
sleeps
father
will
come
to
his
babe
in
the
nest
something
all
out
of
the
west
silvery
we
ran
when
we
got
to
the
smoke
tree
and
looked
back
there
was
no
sound
at
all
in
the
blacksmith
shop
except
the
sound
of
ezra
thumping
his
hoofs
and
jason
being
a
song
instead
of
a
man
the
faster
we
ran
the
more
surprised
we
felt
when
you
a
book
of
course
you
expect
to
be
surprised
if
you
did
think
the
person
who
made
the
book
was
going
to
tell
you
something
that
you
did
know
before
you
would
bother
to
read
it
but
when
you
a
book
it
does
seem
exactly
as
though
so
many
unexpected
things
ought
to
happen
to
you
we
were
pretty
glad
when
we
ran
right
into
the
old
minister
who
preaches
sometimes
when
all
the
young
ministers
ca
think
of
anything
more
to
preach
about
the
old
minister
was
leaning
against
the
bridge
the
old
lawyer
was
leaning
against
the
bridge
with
him
they
were
waving
their
canes
and
their
long
white
beards
and
arguing
about
the
articles
carol
thinks
it
was
the
varieties
they
were
arguing
about
but
the
varieties
i
almost
sure
is
pickles
it
the
articles
that
is
arguments
the
old
minister
laughed
when
he
saw
us
coming
well
well
well
he
cried
see
who
here
and
carrying
such
a
big
book
too
and
all
out
of
breath
he
put
his
arm
round
carol
i
thought
he
was
going
to
ask
us
our
catechisms
and
there
was
any
breath
left
in
our
catechisms
oh
if
you
were
a
beautiful
sound
i
gasped
instead
of
a
beautiful
preacher
what
beautiful
sound
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
would
you
choose
to
be
eh
said
the
old
minister
eh
what
that
a
a
sound
instead
of
a
preacher
well
upon
my
word
this
minute
you
mean
or
any
minute
if
i
was
a
beautiful
sound
instead
of
he
mopped
his
forehead
he
looked
pretty
hot
he
twinkled
his
eyes
at
the
old
lawyer
well
just
minute
he
said
i
rather
be
the
sound
of
foaming
beer
than
anything
else
in
the
world
that
i
can
think
of
he
thumped
his
cane
on
the
ground
the
old
lawyer
thumped
his
cane
on
the
ground
they
both
started
off
down
the
road
thumping
as
they
walked
we
heard
them
chuckling
as
they
thumped
they
were
arguing
any
more
about
the
articles
they
were
arguing
about
cheese
and
that
was
surprising
too
there
was
any
dinner
left
when
we
got
home
except
just
knives
and
forks
and
spoons
my
mother
found
us
two
bowls
to
go
with
the
spoons
and
some
milk
to
go
with
the
bowls
and
some
crackers
to
go
with
the
milk
everything
went
very
well
we
told
my
mother
we
were
sorry
to
be
late
but
that
we
were
writing
a
book
and
it
was
very
important
my
mother
said
yes
she
knew
that
writing
books
was
very
important
and
had
always
noticed
that
people
who
wrote
were
very
apt
to
be
late
to
things
her
only
regret
she
said
was
that
carol
and
i
had
had
a
little
more
time
in
which
to
form
habits
of
promptness
before
we
began
on
such
a
chronic
career
as
literature
my
father
said
stuff
and
nonsense
my
father
said
that
if
we
kindly
condescend
to
tear
ourselves
away
from
the
charms
of
literature
for
one
brief
afternoon
he
like
to
have
us
weed
the
tulip
bed
we
said
we
would
we
forgot
all
about
our
book
it
is
that
pulling
up
weeds
is
any
special
fun
it
the
putting
flowers
back
that
you
pulled
up
by
mistake
that
is
such
a
game
in
itself
you
have
to
make
little
splints
for
them
out
of
forsythia
twigs
you
have
to
build
little
collars
of
all
around
them
to
keep
marauding
beetles
from
eating
up
their
wiltedness
you
have
to
bring
them
from
the
brook
instead
of
from
the
kitchen
so
that
nobody
will
scream
and
say
oh
what
have
you
done
now
oh
what
have
you
done
it
was
supper
time
before
we
knew
it
there
was
creamed
chicken
for
supper
and
wild
strawberry
preserve
and
a
letter
from
our
sister
rosalee
our
sister
rosalee
is
in
cuba
visiting
her
betrother
she
wrote
seven
pages
about
it
she
seemed
to
like
her
betrother
very
much
my
mother
cried
a
little
my
father
said
oh
pshaw
oh
pshaw
you
ca
keep
babies
forever
my
mother
tried
not
to
look
at
my
father
eyes
she
looked
at
his
feet
instead
when
she
looked
at
his
feet
instead
she
saw
that
there
were
holes
in
his
slippers
she
seemed
very
glad
she
ran
and
got
a
big
needle
and
a
big
thread
my
father
had
to
sit
very
still
it
seemed
a
very
good
time
to
remember
about
the
book
carol
went
and
got
the
book
he
put
it
down
on
the
dining
room
table
it
was
a
gray
book
with
a
red
back
to
it
it
said
lanos
bryant
across
the
back
of
it
it
was
lanos
bryant
who
had
given
us
the
book
lanos
bryant
was
the
butcher
it
was
an
old
account
book
the
front
of
it
was
all
mixed
up
with
figurings
it
was
in
the
back
of
it
that
we
were
making
our
book
my
mother
looked
up
she
smiled
at
us
why
bless
my
heart
she
said
we
must
forget
about
the
book
no
such
luck
said
my
father
everybody
smiled
a
little
what
the
book
about
said
my
mother
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
he
nudged
me
to
go
on
it
about
you
i
said
and
about
father
and
about
jason
the
blacksmith
and
about
the
old
preacher
and
about
most
anybody
i
guess
that
would
like
to
be
well
well
well
said
my
mother
and
what
is
it
for
oh
it
just
for
fun
i
said
but
it
very
just
the
first
instant
anybody
reads
it
he
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
everybody
without
ever
having
to
go
and
make
calls
on
them
everything
interesting
about
them
i
mean
everything
that
really
matters
lots
of
things
that
nobody
would
have
guessed
mercy
said
my
mother
she
stopped
mending
my
father
and
jumped
right
up
my
father
jumped
right
up
too
oh
it
is
written
yet
i
said
it
only
just
begun
o
h
said
my
mother
and
sat
down
again
we
though
maybe
you
and
father
would
help
us
i
said
o
h
said
my
father
and
sat
down
again
too
carol
began
to
laugh
i
do
know
why
he
laughed
it
it
just
a
set
of
questions
i
explained
carol
opened
the
book
and
found
the
questions
just
five
or
six
questions
i
explained
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
answer
the
questions
and
tell
us
how
to
spell
it
and
then
that
makes
the
book
it
certainly
sounds
simple
said
my
mother
she
began
mending
my
father
very
hard
and
what
are
some
of
the
questions
she
asked
well
the
first
question
i
explained
is
is
your
name
my
mother
gave
a
little
giggle
she
hushed
my
father
with
her
hand
oh
surely
she
said
there
could
be
any
objection
to
telling
these
pleasant
children
our
names
no
o
admitted
my
father
my
mother
looked
up
she
twinkled
her
eyes
a
little
as
well
as
her
mouth
our
names
are
and
she
said
carol
wrote
the
names
in
the
book
he
wrote
them
very
black
and
literary
looking
father
at
the
top
of
one
page
and
mother
at
the
top
of
the
other
they
looked
nice
all
right
then
said
my
father
fire
away
i
looked
at
my
father
i
looked
at
my
mother
i
did
know
just
which
one
to
begin
with
carol
kicked
me
in
the
shins
for
encouragement
i
decided
to
begin
with
my
mother
oh
mother
i
said
if
you
were
a
beautiful
smell
instead
of
a
beautiful
mother
what
beautiful
smell
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
eh
what
that
said
my
father
well
of
all
the
idiotic
foolishness
of
all
the
why
no
not
at
all
said
my
mother
why
why
i
think
it
rather
interesting
why
why
though
i
must
admit
she
laughed
out
suddenly
that
i
never
quite
thought
of
things
in
just
that
way
before
she
looked
out
the
window
she
looked
in
the
she
looked
at
my
father
she
looked
at
carol
she
looked
at
me
she
began
to
clap
her
hands
i
got
it
she
said
i
know
what
i
choose
a
white
iris
in
all
the
world
there
no
perfume
that
can
compare
with
the
perfume
of
a
white
iris
orris
root
they
call
it
orris
humph
what
the
matter
with
tulips
said
my
father
oh
but
tulips
do
have
any
smell
at
all
said
my
mother
except
just
the
nice
earthy
smell
of
spring
winds
and
spring
rains
and
spring
sunbeams
oh
of
course
they
as
though
they
were
going
to
smell
tremendously
sweet
she
acknowledged
very
politely
but
they
just
so
busy
being
i
suppose
that
the
tulip
goldfinch
said
my
father
coldly
is
noted
for
its
fragrance
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
my
mother
she
seemed
very
sorry
she
folded
her
hands
oh
very
well
she
said
mondays
wednesdays
fridays
and
sundays
i
will
be
the
fragrance
of
the
tulip
goldfinch
but
tuesdays
thursdays
and
saturdays
i
really
must
insist
on
being
the
fragrance
of
a
white
iris
humph
said
my
father
there
are
any
of
them
that
are
worth
the
nice
inky
lithograph
smell
of
the
first
garden
catalogues
that
come
off
the
presses
about
february
my
mother
clapped
her
hands
again
oh
goodie
she
said
write
father
down
as
choosing
to
smell
like
nice
inky
lithograph
smell
of
the
first
garden
catalogues
that
come
off
the
presses
about
february
my
father
had
to
tell
us
how
to
spell
lithograph
carol
wrote
it
very
carefully
my
mother
laughed
well
really
said
my
mother
i
beginning
to
have
a
very
good
what
is
question
no
question
no
i
said
is
if
you
were
a
beautiful
sound
instead
of
a
beautiful
father
and
mother
what
beautiful
sound
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
my
father
felt
better
almost
at
once
oh
pshaw
he
said
that
easy
i
be
the
sound
of
gold
pieces
jingling
in
the
pocket
of
a
man
of
a
man
he
looked
at
my
of
a
man
who
had
a
wife
who
looked
something
like
my
wife
and
three
children
whose
names
when
you
spoke
quickly
sounded
very
similar
yes
very
similar
indeed
to
and
and
oh
what
nonsense
said
my
mother
what
does
the
jingle
of
gold
pieces
amount
to
now
if
i
could
be
any
sound
i
wanted
to
i
choose
to
be
the
sweet
soft
breathy
little
that
a
nice
little
family
makes
when
it
wakes
up
in
the
morning
so
that
no
matter
how
much
you
worried
during
the
long
black
night
you
can
feel
at
once
that
everything
all
right
and
that
everybody
all
there
in
all
the
world
cried
my
mother
i
know
of
no
sweeter
sound
than
the
sound
of
a
nice
little
family
waking
up
in
the
morning
i
turned
to
carol
page
i
laughed
and
laughed
bubbling
fat
is
what
carol
would
like
to
sound
like
i
cried
the
noise
that
bubbling
fat
makes
when
you
drop
doughnuts
into
it
but
i
if
i
could
be
any
lovely
sound
i
wanted
to
i
like
to
be
the
sound
of
rain
on
a
tin
roof
at
night
all
over
the
world
people
would
be
lying
awake
listening
to
you
and
even
if
they
did
want
to
listen
they
have
to
till
you
were
good
and
ready
to
stop
it
took
carol
a
good
while
to
write
down
everything
about
gold
pieces
and
a
nice
little
family
waking
up
in
the
morning
and
rain
on
a
tin
roof
the
next
question
is
pretty
hard
i
explained
maybe
you
like
to
be
thinking
about
if
you
were
a
beautiful
sight
that
people
came
miles
to
see
what
beautiful
sight
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
my
father
did
wait
a
minute
a
field
of
tulips
he
said
carol
pounded
the
table
with
his
fists
his
face
was
like
an
explosion
of
smiles
he
pointed
to
my
father
page
in
the
book
it
already
written
i
said
we
guessed
it
all
the
time
we
turned
to
my
mother
we
saw
a
little
quiver
go
through
my
shoulders
i
choose
to
be
a
storm
at
sea
said
my
mother
cried
my
father
a
storm
at
sea
said
my
mother
my
father
stopped
saying
what
and
made
a
little
gasping
sound
instead
he
said
the
gentlest
soul
that
ever
breathed
would
like
to
be
a
at
sea
it
only
the
side
of
me
that
is
gentle
laughed
my
mother
she
threw
back
her
head
suddenly
she
thrust
out
her
hands
it
jerked
her
soft
calm
hair
all
fluffy
and
wild
across
her
forehead
her
eyes
danced
her
cheeks
turned
all
pink
oh
it
be
fun
she
cried
all
the
roaring
and
the
ranting
and
the
foaming
and
the
racing
up
the
beaches
in
great
waves
and
splashes
against
the
rocks
scaring
the
fishes
almost
to
pieces
rocking
the
boats
till
people
fell
right
out
of
their
berths
onto
the
floor
ruffling
the
gulls
till
you
would
actually
wreck
a
boat
would
you
said
my
father
my
mother
stopped
tossing
her
head
and
waving
her
hands
she
gave
a
little
sigh
she
began
mending
my
father
again
very
hard
just
pirates
she
said
o
h
said
my
father
we
intended
to
make
the
next
one
about
i
explained
but
it
was
too
hard
carol
wanted
to
be
an
elevator
carol
says
an
elevator
is
like
in
a
giant
thermometer
that
gone
mad
he
wanted
to
be
the
motion
it
makes
when
the
elevator
going
down
and
the
coming
up
but
it
made
me
feel
queer
in
my
stomach
merciful
heavens
said
my
father
what
kind
of
a
family
have
i
drawn
my
wife
wants
to
be
a
at
sea
and
my
son
aspires
to
feel
like
an
gone
mad
carol
looked
at
my
mother
my
mother
looked
at
carol
they
laughed
their
eyes
together
so
we
made
it
and
instead
i
explained
made
what
and
instead
said
my
father
the
next
two
questions
i
explained
o
h
said
my
mother
fire
away
said
my
father
question
no
i
said
which
do
you
like
best
or
times
or
things
said
my
father
whatever
in
the
world
do
you
mean
his
eyebrows
looked
pretty
puzzled
why
we
mean
i
explained
if
somebody
gave
you
five
whole
dollars
for
your
birthday
how
would
you
rather
spend
it
what
would
you
get
most
fun
out
of
we
mean
or
would
you
be
most
apt
to
spend
it
for
rabbits
we
mean
or
going
to
a
fair
oh
said
my
father
i
see
times
or
things
times
or
things
why
he
decided
almost
at
once
of
course
when
you
buy
a
you
got
something
really
tangible
for
your
money
something
definite
something
really
to
show
i
admit
would
probably
not
be
my
but
a
book
now
a
set
of
garden
tools
a
pair
of
rubber
boots
even
n
o
said
my
mother
very
softly
i
almost
sure
i
rather
to
the
fair
or
yes
i
perfectly
positive
she
cried
out
that
give
me
more
pleasure
than
do
now
that
i
think
of
it
i
can
see
quite
plainly
that
always
always
preferred
to
spend
my
money
to
the
fair
yes
but
how
foolish
said
my
father
when
the
fair
over
over
nothing
left
to
show
for
it
but
just
a
memory
my
mother
laughed
right
out
loud
it
was
the
prettiest
laugh
now
that
where
you
mistaken
she
laughed
when
the
fair
what
you
call
that
the
time
it
really
books
get
lost
or
puppies
chew
them
garden
tools
rust
even
the
best
rubber
boots
in
the
world
get
the
most
awful
holes
poked
through
their
toes
but
a
happy
memory
a
happy
memory
she
jumped
up
suddenly
and
crept
into
my
father
arms
my
father
stroked
her
hair
and
stroked
it
carol
kicked
me
in
the
shins
there
only
one
more
question
i
cried
out
pretty
loud
what
is
it
said
my
mother
it
sounded
pretty
mumbly
through
my
father
shoulder
oh
this
one
is
very
important
i
said
it
about
colors
said
my
father
he
did
seem
to
care
nearly
as
much
as
have
thought
he
would
c
colors
mumbled
my
mother
somewhere
in
a
book
i
explained
we
read
about
a
man
who
wanted
his
memory
green
why
why
not
pink
why
not
blue
or
even
red
with
a
cunning
little
white
line
in
it
said
my
father
if
you
were
going
away
i
explained
my
mother
hands
clutched
at
his
coat
she
gave
a
queer
little
shiver
oh
not
she
protested
for
ever
and
ever
i
explained
my
mother
face
came
peering
out
from
the
shadow
of
my
shoulder
she
started
to
laugh
and
made
a
little
sob
instead
oh
not
for
ever
and
she
said
we
all
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
i
felt
awful
queer
in
my
stomach
carol
kicked
me
in
the
shins
he
wrote
something
quick
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
shoved
it
across
the
table
at
me
was
the
place
that
carol
meant
i
explained
oh
he
mean
at
all
what
you
thought
he
meant
if
you
were
going
away
to
to
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
and
gave
your
best
friend
a
whole
lot
of
money
like
dollars
to
remember
you
by
what
color
do
you
he
keep
your
memory
oh
yes
why
of
course
said
my
father
quite
quickly
it
a
jolly
one
after
all
is
it
color
color
let
me
see
for
dollars
you
say
yes
yes
the
very
thing
of
course
i
hope
my
best
friend
would
have
wit
enough
to
buy
a
nothing
fancy
you
know
but
something
absolutely
daytimes
to
be
sure
your
memory
would
be
much
use
to
him
but
nights
the
time
everybody
needs
everybody
the
most
nights
i
say
looking
back
from
from
was
it
that
you
designated
nights
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
i
think
to
feel
that
one
lived
on
and
on
as
a
yellow
glow
in
his
friend
life
my
father
reached
out
and
pinched
my
ear
how
about
it
ruthy
he
asked
oh
that
all
right
i
admitted
but
if
gave
my
best
friend
dollars
to
remember
me
by
i
hope
he
buy
a
blueberry
bush
just
of
all
the
colors
it
would
keep
your
memory
white
in
and
blue
in
and
red
as
blood
all
the
autumn
with
brown
rabbits
hopping
through
you
and
speckled
birds
laying
goodness
knows
colored
eggs
and
somebody
banged
the
front
door
somebody
scuffled
on
the
threshold
somebody
shouted
hello
hello
hello
it
was
the
old
doctor
we
ran
to
see
if
he
had
peppermints
in
his
pocket
he
had
after
the
old
doctor
had
given
us
all
the
peppermints
he
thought
we
ought
to
have
and
seven
more
besides
he
sat
down
in
the
big
cretonne
chair
by
the
window
and
fanned
his
neck
with
a
newspaper
he
seemed
to
be
pretty
mad
at
the
people
who
had
made
his
collars
he
said
the
man
who
invented
a
collar
ought
to
be
forced
to
suck
boiling
starch
through
the
neck
of
a
blueing
bottle
we
did
see
just
why
the
old
doctor
said
he
did
care
to
discuss
it
any
news
asked
my
father
news
enough
said
the
old
doctor
he
seemed
pretty
mad
about
that
too
such
as
what
asked
my
father
there
a
prince
and
princess
in
town
said
the
old
doctor
or
a
duch
and
duchess
or
a
fool
and
fooless
i
do
care
what
you
call
they
got
some
sort
of
a
claim
on
the
old
dun
voolees
estate
brook
meadow
blueberry
hillside
popple
grove
everything
they
come
way
from
austria
to
prove
it
going
to
build
a
tannery
or
a
fertilizer
factory
or
some
other
equally
odoriferous
industry
fill
the
town
with
foreign
laborers
string
a
line
of
lowsy
shacks
clear
from
the
blacksmith
shop
to
the
river
hope
they
oh
my
dear
my
dear
said
my
mother
the
old
doctor
looked
a
little
funny
oh
i
admit
it
worth
something
he
said
to
have
you
call
me
your
but
i
mad
i
tell
you
clear
through
and
when
you
got
as
much
to
you
as
i
have
that
he
said
when
i
think
of
our
village
our
precious
clean
decent
simple
little
village
turned
into
a
cheap
racketty
saturday
night
hell
hole
oh
oh
oh
cried
my
mother
quick
get
him
some
raspberry
shrub
cried
my
father
maybe
he
like
to
play
the
children
new
game
cried
my
mother
it
is
a
game
i
explained
it
a
book
my
mother
ran
to
get
the
raspberry
shrub
she
brought
a
whole
pitcher
it
tinkled
with
ice
it
sounded
nice
when
the
old
doctor
had
drunken
it
he
seemed
cooled
quite
a
little
he
put
the
glass
down
on
the
table
he
saw
the
book
he
looked
surprised
lanos
bryant
accounts
he
read
he
looked
at
the
date
he
looked
at
my
father
what
you
trying
to
do
man
he
said
reconstruct
a
financial
picture
of
our
village
as
it
was
a
generation
ago
or
trace
your
son
carol
very
palpable
distaste
for
a
brush
back
to
his
grandfather
somewhat
avid
devotion
to
pork
chops
he
picked
up
the
book
he
opened
the
first
pages
he
read
the
names
written
at
the
tops
of
the
pages
some
of
the
names
were
pretty
alden
hoppin
weymoth
dun
vorlees
he
read
he
put
on
his
glasses
he
scrunched
his
eyes
he
grunted
his
throat
he
said
a
hundred
pounds
of
beans
in
one
month
is
it
any
wonder
that
young
alden
ran
away
to
sea
and
sunk
clear
to
the
bottom
in
his
first
shipwreck
beef
beef
and
hops
and
hops
beef
and
hops
is
where
old
man
weymoth
got
his
rheumatism
and
young
weymoth
his
blood
pressure
dun
vorlees
dun
vorlees
no
meat
at
all
from
november
to
february
no
fruit
only
three
pounds
of
sugar
great
gastronomics
back
of
all
that
arrogance
that
insulting
aloofness
was
hunger
gnawing
at
the
dun
vorlees
vitals
was
the
reason
why
merciful
heavens
cried
the
old
doctor
this
book
is
worth
twenty
dollars
to
me
this
very
minute
in
my
practice
the
light
it
sheds
on
the
village
stomach
the
village
nerves
the
please
sir
i
said
the
book
is
carol
lanos
bryant
gave
it
to
and
we
planning
to
get
a
great
deal
more
than
twenty
dollars
for
it
when
we
sell
it
said
the
old
doctor
he
jerked
round
in
his
chair
and
at
carol
i
have
you
understand
my
young
man
he
said
is
in
the
cause
of
science
carol
looked
pretty
nervous
he
began
to
smooth
his
hair
as
well
as
he
could
without
bristles
it
did
smooth
much
oh
please
sir
i
explained
people
who
write
books
have
smooth
hair
who
talking
about
writing
books
roared
the
old
doctor
please
sir
trying
to
talk
about
it
i
said
my
voice
sounded
pretty
little
it
the
part
of
the
book
that
the
important
part
i
explained
it
the
back
part
of
the
book
that
we
writing
said
the
old
doctor
he
slammed
the
book
together
he
stood
up
and
began
to
look
for
his
hat
there
did
seem
a
moment
to
lose
if
we
we
going
to
get
him
into
our
book
i
ran
and
caught
him
by
the
hand
even
if
his
face
was
busy
his
hands
always
had
time
to
be
friends
with
carol
and
me
oh
please
please
i
besought
him
if
you
were
a
beautiful
smell
instead
of
a
beautiful
doctor
what
beautiful
smell
in
the
whole
wide
world
would
you
choose
to
be
what
said
the
old
doctor
he
kept
saying
over
and
over
he
looked
at
my
father
he
looked
at
my
mother
my
mother
told
him
about
our
book
he
made
a
loud
guffaw
guffaw
i
is
the
noise
he
made
carol
is
that
it
is
he
looked
at
carol
he
looked
at
me
he
began
to
guffaw
all
over
again
well
really
young
authorettes
he
said
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
you
or
how
to
choose
ether
or
chloroform
and
general
disinfectants
being
the
most
familiar
savors
of
my
daily
life
the
only
savors
indeed
that
i
ever
expect
to
suggest
to
anybody
he
looked
out
the
window
there
was
an
tree
it
made
the
window
look
very
full
of
june
his
collar
seemed
to
hurt
him
it
made
him
pretty
serious
it
made
his
voice
all
solemn
but
i
tell
you
kiddies
he
said
quite
suddenly
i
tell
you
the
sweetest
thing
that
i
ever
smelled
in
my
life
it
was
the
first
summer
i
was
back
from
i
was
out
on
the
common
playing
ball
somebody
brought
me
word
that
my
father
was
i
did
go
i
slunk
off
instead
to
my
favorite
and
sat
down
under
a
big
white
birch
tree
and
i
was
very
bitter
i
needed
my
father
very
much
that
year
and
my
was
a
harsh
late
that
night
when
i
got
home
ugly
with
sorrow
i
found
that
i
left
my
catcher
glove
it
happened
to
be
one
that
my
father
had
given
with
matches
and
a
lantern
i
fumbled
my
way
back
to
the
brook
the
old
glove
lay
in
the
moss
and
leaves
somebody
had
filled
the
palm
with
wild
i
put
my
face
down
in
it
like
a
kid
and
bawled
my
heart
it
was
little
annie
dun
vorlees
it
seemed
who
had
put
the
violets
there
trailed
me
clear
from
the
ball
field
little
kid
too
only
fourteen
years
to
my
twenty
why
her
mother
would
even
let
me
come
to
the
house
had
made
annie
promise
even
not
to
speak
to
but
when
trouble
hit
me
little
annie
the
old
doctor
frowned
his
eyebrows
words
he
said
it
after
all
that
have
the
real
fragrance
to
now
take
that
word
for
instance
i
ca
even
see
it
in
a
newspaper
without
he
put
back
his
head
suddenly
he
gave
a
queer
little
chuckle
sounds
funny
does
it
kiddies
he
laughed
to
say
that
the
sweetest
thing
you
ever
smelled
in
your
life
was
an
old
baseball
glove
thrown
down
on
the
mossy
bank
of
a
brook
i
looked
at
carol
carol
looked
at
me
his
eyes
were
popping
we
ran
to
the
book
we
snatched
it
open
it
bumped
our
heads
we
pointed
to
the
writing
i
read
it
out
loud
the
most
beautiful
smell
in
the
world
is
the
smell
of
an
old
tattered
baseball
glove
that
been
lying
in
the
damp
grass
by
the
side
of
a
brook
in
june
time
my
mother
looked
funny
good
gracious
she
said
are
my
children
developing
sight
first
it
was
the
of
tulips
already
written
down
as
their
father
choice
before
he
could
even
get
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
and
now
hours
before
the
old
doctor
ever
even
dreamed
of
the
book
existence
they
got
his
distinctly
unique
taste
in
perfumes
all
but
this
is
the
old
doctor
i
cried
out
she
wrote
it
herself
it
the
lady
down
at
the
hotel
it
the
the
empress
that
the
old
doctor
was
talking
about
the
empress
gasped
the
old
doctor

admitted
it

some
one
from
austria

to
fuss
about
the
old
dun
vorlees
place

said
it
was
you

that
who
it
was
it
the
only
strange
lady
in
the
village
what
gasped
the
old
doctor
he
looked
at
the
book
he
read
the
lady
writing
anybody
could
have
seen
that
it
was
our
writing
it
was
too
dressy
he
put
on
his
glasses
he
read
it
again
the
smell
of
an
old
tattered
baseball
glove
that
been
lying
in
the
damp
grass
side
of
a
brook
june
time
good
lord
he
cried
out
good
lord
he
could
seem
to
swallow
through
his
collar
not
anyone
else
he
gasped
in
all
the
world
there
could
possibly
be
anyone
else
it
must
it
be
little
annie
dun
vorlees
herself
he
rushed
to
the
window
there
was
a
grocery
boy
driving
by
hi

he
called
out

now

me
quick
to
the
hotel
it
an
emergency

tell
you
she
may
be
gone
before
i
get
there
we
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
curled
up
our
legs
our
legs
felt
queer
my
mother
and
father
sat
down
on
the
other
sofa
they
looked
queer
all
over
they
began
to
talk
about
the
village
it
was
exactly
the
village
that
we
knew
it
was
as
though
they
talked
about
the
village
when
it
was
a
they
talked
about
when
the
bridge
was
first
built
they
talked
about
the
spring
when
the
big
freshet
swept
the
meadow
they
talked
about
the
funny
color
of
jason
the
first
long
trousers
they
talked
about
a
tiny
mottled
fawn
that
they
had
caught
once
with
their
own
hands
at
a
sunday
school
picnic
in
the
arbutus
woods
they
talked
about
the
choir
rehearsals
in
the
old
white
church
they
talked
about
my
father
graduation
essay
in
the
high
school
it
was
like
history
that
was
sweet
instead
of
just
true
it
made
you
feel
a
little
lonely
in
your
throat
our
tame
coon
came
and
curled
up
on
our
legs
it
made
our
legs
feel
better
the
clock
struck
nine
our
father
and
mother
forgot
all
about
us
pretty
soon
we
forgot
all
about
ourselves
when
we
woke
up
the
old
doctor
had
come
back
he
was
standing
by
the
table
in
the
lamplight
talking
to
my
father
and
my
mother
he
looked
just
the
same
only
different
like
a
portrait
in
a
newspaper
that
somebody
had
tried
to
copy
all
around
the
inner
edges
of
his
bigness
it
was
as
though
someone
had
sketched
the
outline
of
a
slimmer
it
looked
nice
well
it
little
annie
dun
vorlees
he
said
was
it
indeed
said
my
father
has
changed
a
mite
said
the
old
doctor
not
a
mite
oh
of
course
she
wearing
silks
now
instead
of
and
her
hair
well
perhaps
it
just
a
little
bit
gray
but
gray
hair
very
pretty
said
my
mother
humph
said
the
old
doctor
i
expected
of
course
that
she
think
me
changed
a
good
deal
i
grown
stout
she
called
she
thought
i
looked
healthy
the
old
doctor
shifted
his
feet
he
twitched
at
a
newspaper
on
the
table
that
austrian
gentlemen
with
her
is
her
husband
he
said
she
a
she
a
widow
it
her
husband
brother
really
said
my
father
oh
said
the
old
doctor
i
guess
perhaps
i
spoke
a
little
bit
hastily
when
i
was
here
before
about
their
ruining
the
village
i
been
talking
a
bit
with
annie
and
his
face
turned
quite
red
suddenly
he
laughed
a
little
there
wo
be
any
changes
made
at
present
in
the
old
dun
vorlees
place
i
not
at
present
anyhow
he
looked
over
at
us
we
scrunched
our
eyes
perfectly
tight
asleep
he
said
he
picked
up
our
book
he
tucked
it
under
his
arm
he
looked
at
my
father
and
mother
it
quite
time
he
said
that
you
started
a
bank
account
for
these
children
college
it
costs
a
great
deal
to
send
children
to
college
nowadays
carol
will
surely
want
a
lot
of
baseball
and
girls
i
know
are
forever
needing
bonnets
he
took
two
big
gold
pieces
from
his
pocket
and
put
them
down
on
the
table
where
our
book
had
been
they
looked
very
shining
my
father
gave
a
little
gasp
he
jumped
up
he
started
to
argue
my
mother
hushed
him
with
her
hand
s
sh
not
she
whispered
not
she
looked
at
the
old
doctor
she
looked
at
our
book
all
hugged
up
tight
under
his
arm
her
eyes
looked
as
though
they
were
going
to
cry
but
her
mouth
looked
as
though
it
was
going
to
laugh
oh
of
course
if
it
in
the
cause
of
science
she
said
if
it
in
the
cause
of
science
the
little
dog
who
could
sleep
it
was
our
uncle
peter
who
sent
us
the
little
piece
of
paper
it
was
a
piece
of
paper
torn
out
of
that
part
of
a
newspaper
where
people
tell
what
they
want
if
they
got
money
enough
to
pay
for
it
this
is
what
it
said
wanted
a
little
dog
who
ca
sleep
to
be
night
companion
for
a
little
boy
who
ca
sleep
will
pay
fifty
dollars
our
uncle
peter
sent
it
to
my
father
and
told
him
to
give
it
to
us
your
children
know
so
many
dogs
he
said
not
fifty
dollars
worth
said
my
father
he
said
it
with
points
in
his
eyes
oh
i
not
so
sure
said
my
mother
she
said
it
with
just
a
little
smile
in
her
voice
it
was
my
mother
who
gave
us
the
big
sheet
of
brown
paper
to
make
our
sign
my
brother
carol
mixed
the
paint
i
mixed
the
letters
it
was
a
nice
sign
we
nailed
it
on
the
barn
where
everybody
who
went
by
could
see
it
it
said
carol
and
ruthy
dealers
in
dogs
who
ca
sleep
nobody
dealt
with
us
we
were
pretty
discouraged
we
asked
the
grocer
if
he
had
a
little
dog
who
could
sleep
we
asked
the
postman
we
asked
the
butcher
they
had
we
asked
the
old
whiskery
man
who
came
every
spring
to
buy
old
bottles
and
papers
he
had
he
brought
the
dog
on
a
dungeon
chain
he
said
if
we
give
him
fifty
cents
for
the
dungeon
chain
we
could
have
the
dog
for
nothing
it
seemed
like
a
very
good
bargain
our
father
lent
us
the
fifty
cents
he
was
a
nice
dog
we
named
him
tiger
lily
his
hair
was
red
and
smooth
as
sunday
all
except
his
paws
and
ears
his
paws
and
ears
were
sort
of
rumpled
his
eyes
were
gold
and
very
sweet
like
keepsakes
you
must
never
spend
he
had
a
sad
tail
he
was
a
setter
dog
he
was
meant
to
hunt
but
he
could
hunt
because
he
was
so
shy
it
was
guns
that
he
was
so
shy
about
our
mother
invited
us
to
wash
him
he
washed
very
nicely
we
wrote
our
triumph
to
our
uncle
peter
and
asked
him
to
send
us
the
fifty
dollars
our
uncle
peter
came
instead
in
an
automobile
and
took
tiger
lily
and
carol
and
me
to
the
city
of
course
he
is
exactly
a
dog
we
admitted
but
at
least
he
a
dog
and
at
least
he
sleep
well
i
wonder
said
our
uncle
peter
he
seemed
very
pleased
to
wonder
about
it
he
twisted
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
at
tiger
lily
what
do
you
mean
sleep
he
said
because
my
brother
carol
is
dumb
and
never
talks
i
always
have
to
do
the
explaining
it
was
easy
to
explain
about
tiger
lily
why
when
you
in
bed
and
fast
asleep
i
explained
he
comes
and
puts
his
nose
in
your
neck
it
feels
wet
it
full
of
sighs
and
a
cool
breeze
it
makes
you
jump
and
want
your
mother
all
the
rest
of
the
time
at
night
he
roaming
and
prowling
and
up
the
front
stairs
and
down
the
back
and
up
the
front
and
down
the
back
every
window
he
comes
to
he
stops
and
listens
and
listens
his
have
never
been
cut
it
sounds
lonely
what
does
he
seem
to
be
listening
for
said
our
uncle
peter
listening
for
i
explained
o
h
said
our
uncle
peter
the
city
was
full
of
noises
like
it
made
tiger
lily
very
nervous
he
tried
to
get
under
everything
it
took
us
most
all
the
afternoon
to
get
him
out
the
little
boy
name
was
dicky
he
was
at
home
come
again
said
the
man
at
the
door
we
came
again
about
eight
at
night
it
seemed
as
late
as
christmas
eve
and
sort
of
lonely
without
our
parents
or
any
other
presents
we
had
to
climb
a
lot
of
stairs
it
made
tiger
lily
puff
a
little
and
look
very
glad
it
made
our
uncle
peter
puff
some
too
it
made
the
little
boy
mother
puff
a
good
deal
there
was
any
father
the
mother
was
all
in
black
about
it
her
clothes
looked
very
sorrowful
but
her
face
was
just
sort
of
surprised
she
had
white
hands
she
carried
them
all
curved
up
like
she
was
pretty
even
if
you
never
seen
her
but
once
in
a
train
window
you
always
have
remembered
the
little
boy
room
was
very
large
and
full
of
lights
there
were
tinkly
glass
things
hanging
everywhere
there
was
a
playing
there
was
a
tin
railroad
train
running
round
and
round
the
room
all
by
itself
making
a
bangy
noise
there
was
a
bird
in
a
toy
cage
crying
hi
hi
there
was
a
crackling
fire
everything
was
tinkling
or
playing
or
singing
or
banging
or
crackling
it
sounded
busy
you
had
to
talk
very
loud
to
make
any
one
hear
you
the
little
boy
sat
on
top
of
a
table
in
a
big
bay
window
looking
out
at
the
night
his
knees
were
all
cuddled
up
into
the
curve
of
his
arms
he
had
on
a
little
red
wrapper
and
bare
legs
and
fur
slippers
he
was
lots
littler
than
us
he
looked
cunning
we
stamped
our
feet
on
the
rug
here

dog
i
said
when
the
little
boy
saw
tiger
lilly
he
jumped
right
down
from
the
table
and
screamed
it
was
with
joy
that
he
screamed
he
threw
his
arms
right
around
tiger
lily
neck
and
screamed
all
over
again
tiger
lily
liked
it
very
much
what
makes
his
paws
so
fluffy
he
screamed
how
soft
his
face
is

eyes

a
sad
tail

for
him

drink
coffee
just
as
though
he
was
mad
about
something
he
began
suddenly
to
jump
up
and
down
and
cry
tears
why
does
somebody
answer
me
he
screamed
why
does
somebody
tell
me
he
got
so
excited
about
it
that
he
hit
carol
on
the
nose
and
blooded
him
quite
a
good
deal
the
little
boy
mother
came
running
oh

world
he
glared
at
little
dicky

the
world
he
said
a
child
who
does
babble
or
fuss

more
and
more
surprised
she
turned
to
the
little
boy

said

dicky
looked
at
his
mother
he
looked
at
carol
a
little
pucker
came
and
blacked
itself
between
his
eyebrows
as
though
to
toss
the
pucker
away
he
tossed
back
his
whole
head
and
ran
to
tiger
lily
and
threw
his
arms
around
tiger
lily
neck

wiggled
right
out
of
them
and
ran
back
to
tiger
lily

it
his
adenoids
he
cried

his
eyes

cried
dicky
his
mother

a
sorry
sound
in
her
throat
poor
dicky
she
said

had
most
everything
done
to
him
tonsils
spine
eyes
ears
teeth
why
the
last
doctor
i
saw
was
almost
positive
that
the
insomnia
was
due
entirely
to
in
the
very
middle
of
what
it
was
due
to
she
turned
to
our
uncle
peter
her
voice
got
very
private
our
uncle
peter
had
to
stoop
his
head
to
hear
it
he
had
a
proud
head
it
did
stoop
very
easily
he
is
my
own
little
boy
she
whispered
as
though
his
ears
were
magic
the
little
boy
looked
up
and
grinned
his
eyes
looked
naughty
nobody
own
little
boy
he
said
nobody

boy
as
though
it
was
a
song
without
any
tune
he
began
to
sing
it
nobody
own
little
boy
the
lady
tried
to
stop
him
he
struck
at
her
with
his
feet

made
a
hurt
on
her
arm
he
snatched
tiger
lily
by
the
collar
and
started
for
the
door
going
to
find
cook
and
get
a
bone
he
said
he
said
it
like
a
boast
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
it
made
a
rude
noise
he
came
running
back
and
looked
a
little
sorry
but
mostly
bashful
he
pointed
at
tiger
lily
what

he
afraid
of

the
little
boy

he
ran
back
to
the
table
to
get

was
a
nice
gun

was
painted
bright
blue

looked
loud
when
tiger
lily
saw
it
he
dove
under
the
bed
it
was
hard
to
get
him
out

little
boy

very
astonished

way
down
in
his
little
fur
slippers
it
was
as
though
a
little
sigh
started
and
shivered
itself
up
till
it
reached
his
smile
it
made
his
smile
sort
of
wobbly
oh
all
right
he
said
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
to
hide
the
blue
in
the
bottom
of
the
closet
a
velocipede
he
piled
on
top
of
it
and
two
pillows
and
a
noah
ark
and
a
stuffed
squirrel
when
the
piling
was
all
done
he
looked
back
at
our
uncle
peter
it
was
across
one
shoulder
that
he
looked
back
it
made
his
little
smile
look
twisty
as
well
as
wobbly
one
of
his
eyebrows
had
crooked
itself
it
it
silences
that
i
afraid
of
he
said
he
grabbed
tiger
lily
by
the
collar
again
and
started
for
the
door
as
though
he
was
playing
a
game
he
reached
out
one
finger
and
tagged
everybody
as
he
passed
them
everybody
except
carol
when
he
started
to
tag
carol
he
snatched
back
his
finger
and
screamed
instead
he
a
silence
he
screamed
he
a
silence
still
holding
tight
to
tiger
lily
collar
he
ran
for
the
stairs
his
little
fur
slippers
thudded
on
the
hard
wood
floor
lily
clicked
along
beside
him
it
sounded
cool
and
slippery
his
mother
wrung
her
hands
it
seemed
to
be
with
despair
that
she
wrung
them
yes
that
just
it
she
despaired
it
that
he
afraid
of
that
what
keeps
him
awake
all
night
banging
at
things
that
what
worries
him
so
but
he
gave
up
the
noisy
said
our
uncle
peter
gave
it
up
of
his
own
accord
when
he
saw
that
it
frightened
the
dog
why
so
he
did
said
the
mother
she
seemed
very
much
surprised
why
so
he
did
why
i
do
know
that
i
ever
knew
him
to
give
up
anything
before
he
been
so
delicate
and
and
the
only
child
and
everything
i
afraid
we
spoiled
him
u
m
m
said
our
uncle
peter
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
so
bewildering
despaired
the
lady
like
white
floating
in
a
black
gloom
her
sad
hands
curled
in
her
lap
it
seemed
to
be
at
our
uncle
peter
that
they
curled
are
they
indeed
said
our
uncle
peter
it
was
the
circumstances
that
he
meant
very
bewildering
said
the
lady
her
cheeks
got
a
little
pink
she
jumped
up
and
went
to
the
door
and
listened
a
minute
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
when
she
came
back
to
her
chair
she
shut
the
door
behind
her
as
i
told
you
she
whispered
the
little
boy
is
my
own
little
boy
so
i
understood
said
our
uncle
peter
his
mother
died
when
he
was
born
said
the
lady
very
sad
indeed
said
our
uncle
peter
dicky
is
six
years
old
said
the
lady
i
married
his
father
a
year
and
a
half
ago
his
father
was
killed
in
an
accident
a
year
ago
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
our
uncle
peter
the
lady
began
all
over
again
as
though
it
was
a
lesson
dicky
is
six
years
old
she
said
i
married
his
father
a
year
and
a
half
ago
he
was
killed
in
an
accident
a
year
ago
it
was
all
so
sudden
the
marriage
the
accident
everything
she
began
to
cry
a
little
it
made
her
clothes
look
sorrowfuller
and
sorrowfuller
and
her
face
more
and
more
surprised
once
again
she
curled
up
her
white
hands
at
our
uncle
peter
it
was
as
though
she
thought
that
our
uncle
peter
could
help
her
perhaps
with
some
of
her
surprises
i
i
did
know
his
father
very
long
she
cried
i
never
knew
his
mother
at
all
it
it
pretty
bewildering
she
said
to
be
left
all
alone
for
life
with
a
perfectly
strange
little
boy
who
is
any
relation
at
all
all
his
funny
little
suits
to
worry
about
and
his
mumps
and
his
measles
and
and
whether
he
ought
to
play
marbles
keeps
and
shall
i
send
him
to
college
or
not
and
suppose
he
turns
out
a
burglar
or
something
dreadful
like
that
and
how
in
the
world
am
i
going
to
tackle
his
first
love
affair
or
his
choice
of
a
profession
merciful
heavens
perhaps
he
want
to
fly
why
you
just
like
a
hen
said
our
uncle
peter
the
lady
did
like
to
be
called
a
hen
it
ruffled
her
all
up
our
uncle
peter
had
to
talk
about
base
ball
to
soothe
her
the
lady
did
know
anything
about
base
ball
but
it
seemed
to
soothe
her
considerably
to
hear
about
it
when
our
uncle
peter
was
all
through
soothing
her
she
looked
up
as
pleasant
as
pleasant
could
be
why
she
said
why
what
said
our
uncle
peter
he
seemed
a
little
perplexed
why
am
i
like
a
hen
said
the
lady
o
h
said
our
uncle
peter
he
acted
very
much
relieved
o
h
he
said
i
was
afraid
it
was
something
you
were
going
to
ask
me
about
base
ball
but
a
hen
he
looked
with
smiles
at
the
lady
oh
but
a
hen
why
even
a
hen
my
dear
madam
he
smiled
a
real
professional
hen
does
take
any
too
easily
to
the
actual
chick
itself
until
she
served
a
certain
sort
of
apprenticeship
as
it
were
to
the
thrust
a
bunch
of
chicks
under
her
before
she
served
this
apprenticeship
and
i
jumped
up
and
down
and
clapped
my
hands
i
just
could
help
it
oh
i
know
what
happens
i
cried
she
sits
too
heavy
and
squashes
perfectly
flat
there
was
a
hen
i
cried
her
name
was
lizzie
she
was
a
good
hen
but
childless
the
grocer
gave
us
some
chicks
to
put
under
her
but
when
we
went
out
to
the
nest
the
next
morning
to
see
they
could
have
been
flatter
if
they
been
pressed
in
the
bible
my
brother
carol
cried
i
cried
my
mother
i
do
care
at
all
who
cried
said
the
lady
it
was
true
she
did
all
she
cared
was
to
look
at
our
uncle
peter
the
look
was
a
stern
look
and
are
you
trying
to
imply
merredith
said
our
uncle
peter
percival
for
short
merredith
repeated
the
lady
coldly
are
you
trying
to
imply
that
my
looks
as
though
he
had
been
pressed
in
a
a
bible
i
shook
in
my
boots
carol
shook
in
his
boots
you
could
hear
us
our
uncle
peter
never
shook
a
bit
he
just
twinkled
well
hardly
he
said
the
lady
looked
pretty
surprised
when
she
was
looking
surprised
she
looked
thoughtful
her
voice
sounded
little
when
she
got
it
started
again
maybe
maybe
i
do
take
my
responsibilities
too
heavily
she
said
but
it
this
this
sleeping
business
that
worries
me
so
i
should
think
it
would
said
our
uncle
peter
no
nurse
maid
will
stay
with
me
said
the
lady
they
say
it
gives
them
the
it
enough
to
give
anyone
the
a
grown
person
of
course
expects
a
certain
amount
of
wakefulness
but
a
child
a
little
heedless
child
just
when
you
think
got
him
safely
to
sleep
all
cuddled
up
in
your
own
bed
or
even
in
his
own
bed
and
are
just
drowsing
off
into
the
first
real
sleep
you
had
for
a
week
patter
patter
patter
in
the
hall
creak
creak
creak
on
the
stairs
a
chair
bumped
over
in
the
library
bumped
over
on
purpose
you
understand
just
to
make
a
noise
are
his
friends
he
says
why
once
once
the
lady
mouth
smiled
a
little
once
when
i
woke
and
missed
him
and
hunted
everywhere
i
found
him
at
last
in
the
pantry
on
the
floor
with
his
ear
cuddled
close
up
to
a
noises
he
says
are
his
special
friends
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
there
is
anything
anything
to
break
the
silence
it
seems
to
be
why
in
the
world
should
he
be
afraid
of
a
silence
nobody
can
account
for
it
possibly
not
said
our
uncle
peter
yet
the
fact
remains
that
either
within
or
just
outside
the
borders
of
his
consciousness
the
only
two
people
responsible
for
his
being
have
disappeared
unaccountably
into
a
silence
from
which
they
have
not
returned
oh
dear
said
the
lady
i
never
thought
of
that
you
mean
you
mean
that
perhaps
he
thinks
that
a
silence
is
a
hole
that
you
might
fall
into
if
you
do
fill
it
up
with
a
noise
why
the
poor
little
fellow
how
in
the
world
is
one
ever
to
tell
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
and
floated
her
hands
in
her
lap
her
eyes
looked
as
though
she
was
going
to
cry
again
but
she
did
cry
that
is
not
much
mostly
she
just
sighed
it
is
as
though
he
was
an
easy
child
to
understand
she
sighed
he
catches
cold
so
easily
and
mumps
and
and
he
so
he
kicks
he
bites
he
scratches
so
i
have
seen
demonstrated
said
our
uncle
peter
oh
it
quite
evident
cried
the
lady
that
you
think
i
harsh
with
him
but
whatever
in
the
world
would
you
do
she
threw
out
her
hands
toward
the
pretty
room
the
rugs
the
pictures
the
fire
the
toys
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
what
he
needs
she
said
a
good
spanking
said
our
uncle
peter
the
lady
gave
a
little
gasp
oh
not
for
punishment
said
our
uncle
peter
but
just
for
it
the
only
exercise
that
a
lot
of
pampered
sedentary
children
ever
get
p
pampered
gasped
the
lady
s
sed
entary
as
though
her
head
was
bursting
with
the
noises
all
around
the
room
she
clapped
her
hands
over
her
ears
our
uncle
peter
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
began
to
chase
the
little
tin
railroad
train
it
looked
funny
to
see
so
large
a
man
running
after
so
small
a
train
when
he
caught
it
it
was
having
a
railroad
accident
in
the
tunnel
under
the
table
where
a
book
had
fallen
on
the
track
like
a
beetle
with
no
paint
on
its
stomach
he
left
it
lying
on
its
back
with
its
little
wheels
kicking
in
the
air
if
only
all
the
racket
was
as
easily
disposed
of
said
the
lady
it
is
said
our
uncle
peter
like
turning
off
faucets
of
water
he
turned
off
the
noises
one
by
one
the
that
made
the
glass
dangles
tinkle
the
funny
jiggly
spring
that
kept
the
toy
bird
screaming
in
its
wicker
cake
the
music
box
that
tooted
horns
and
beat
drums
right
in
the
middle
of
its
best
tunes
he
looked
like
a
giant
stalking
through
the
noah
ark
animals
his
foot
was
longer
than
the
village
store
if
only
i
figured
as
largely
in
a
less
miniature
world
he
said
he
looked
at
the
lady
very
hard
when
he
said
it
as
though
he
was
saying
something
very
important
the
lady
did
seem
to
consider
it
important
at
all
she
looked
at
her
skirts
instead
and
smoothed
them
very
tidily
it
a
it
a
pleasant
day
is
it
said
our
uncle
peter
v
very
said
the
lady
quite
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
her
cheeks
were
pink
she
seemed
to
want
to
speak
but
did
know
quite
how
she
looked
more
surprised
than
ever
she
bent
forward
very
suddenly
and
stared
and
stared
at
him
why
why
you
the
gentleman
she
said
who
was
in
the
fruit
store
the
day
i
bought
the
alligator
pears
and
dropped
my
down
behind
the
also
the
day
you
bought
the
red
mackintosh
apples
said
our
uncle
peter
the
grocer
cheated
you
outrageously
on
also
the
day
you
wore
the
bunch
of
white
violets
and
pricked
your
finger
so
brutally
also
the
day
on
the
ferry
when
there
was
a
slight
collision
with
a
and
i
had
the
privilege
of
of
the
lady
looked
very
haughty
it
was
the
day
of
the
alligator
pears
that
i
referred
to
she
said
the
only
day
in
my
recollection
very
positively
she
said
it
the
only
day
in
my
recollection
but
all
the
time
that
she
said
it
her
cheeks
got
pinker
and
pinker
it
was
when
she
looked
in
the
glass
and
saw
how
mistaken
her
positiveness
looked
that
her
cheeks
got
so
pink
tap
tap
tap
her
foot
stamped
on
the
rug
did
did
you
know
who
it
was
going
to
be
when
you
brought
the
dog
she
said
that
is
did
you
know
when
you
first
saw
the
advertisement
in
the
paper
her
white
forehead
got
all
black
and
frowny
how
in
the
world
did
you
know
my
name
she
said
our
uncle
peter
made
an
expression
on
his
face
it
was
the
expression
that
our
mother
calls
his
expression
bold
and
unashamed
i
asked
the
grocer
he
said
it
was
a
a
great
liberty
said
the
lady
was
it
said
our
uncle
peter
he
did
seem
as
sorry
as
you
have
expected
the
lady
looked
at
carol
the
lady
looked
at
me
how
many
children
have
you
she
said
none
of
my
own
said
our
uncle
peter
but
three
of
my
brother
philip
carol
and
ruthy
as
here
observed
and
rosalee
aet
eighteen
who
is
at
present
in
cuba
engaging
herself
to
be
married
o
h
said
the
lady
i
am
in
short
said
our
uncle
peter
that
object
of
romance
and
pity
popularly
known
as
a
uncle
o
h
said
the
lady
she
seemed
more
relieved
than
you
have
supposed
but
in
my
own
case
of
course
said
our
uncle
peter
in
the
very
midst
of
his
own
case
he
stopped
right
off
short
to
look
all
around
the
room
again
as
though
he
was
counting
how
heavy
the
toys
were
and
how
heavy
the
money
was
that
had
bought
the
toys
all
the
twinkle
came
back
to
his
eyes
but
in
my
own
case
he
said
i
always
known
ahead
of
course
for
a
very
long
time
that
i
was
going
to
have
learned
to
sit
lightly
on
the
idea
my
prejudices
my
have
what
gasped
the
lady
nephews
and
nieces
said
our
uncle
peter
o
h
said
the
lady
had
their
names
all
selected
i
mean
explained
our
uncle
peter
their
virtues
their
vices
their
avocations
all
decided
ruthy
of
course
might
have
done
with
less
freckles
and
carol
here
does
quite
come
up
to
specifications
yet
concerning
muscle
and
brawn
and
it
was
never
my
original
intention
of
course
that
any
young
niece
of
mine
should
engage
herself
to
the
first
boy
she
fell
in
love
but
taken
all
in
all
all
in
all
i
say
i
think
frowned
the
lady
you
are
perfectly
absurd
the
word
absurd
did
seem
to
be
at
all
the
word
she
meant
to
say
she
tried
to
bite
it
back
but
got
it
all
mixed
up
with
a
little
giggle
she
bit
the
giggle
instead
it
twisted
her
mouth
like
a
bitter
taste
our
uncle
peter
looked
very
sympathetic
you
ought
to
get
away
somewhere
on
a
journey
he
said
nothing
like
it
as
a
tonic
for
the
mind
even
if
it
a
place
you
like
very
much
it
clarifies
the
vision
so
dissipates
all
one
minor
worries
minor
worries
said
the
lady
travel
yes
that
the
thing
said
our
uncle
peter
quite
positively
all
in
a
minute
he
seemed
to
rustle
with
time
tables
and
maps
and
smell
of
cinders
and
railroad
tickets
now
there
bermuda
for
instance
he
suggested
just
a
month
of
blue
waters
and
white
sand
would
put
the
roses
back
in
your
and
dicky
impossible
said
the
lady
or
if
bermuda
too
far
insisted
our
uncle
peter
what
about
atlantic
city
think
how
dicky
would
enjoy
romping
on
the
board
walk
while
you
followed
more
sedately
of
course
in
a
luxurious
wheel
chair
the
most
diverting
place
in
the
world
yes
quite
surely
you
must
go
to
atlantic
city
the
lady
made
a
little
gasp
as
though
her
patience
was
bursted
you
do
seem
to
understand
she
said
i
tell
you
it
quite
impossible
said
our
uncle
peter
he
said
it
sharply
like
a
teacher
it
had
to
be
answered
the
lady
looked
up
she
looked
down
she
looked
sideways
she
wrung
her
hands
in
her
lap
her
face
got
sort
of
white
it
is
very
kind
of
you
she
said
to
force
me
so
to
a
confession
of
poverty
laughed
our
uncle
peter
he
looked
around
at
the
furniture
at
the
toys
at
the
pictures
it
was
at
most
everything
that
he
looked
around
he
seemed
to
be
very
cheerful
about
it
the
lady
did
like
his
cheerfulness
oh
i
always
had
a
little
for
myself
she
explained
enough
for
one
person
to
live
very
simply
on
but
now
with
this
strange
little
boy
on
my
hands
i
i
intend
to
go
to
work
go
to
work
said
our
uncle
peter
work
he
said
it
with
a
sort
of
a
hoot
work
work
why
what
in
the
world
could
you
do
i
can
crochet
said
the
lady
proudly
and
embroider
i
can
mend
i
can
play
the
piano
and
really
you
know
i
can
make
the
most
beautiful
pies
apple
pies
said
our
uncle
peter
apple
pies
said
the
lady
like
a
handful
of
black
tissue
paper
she
crumpled
up
suddenly
in
her
chair
her
shoulders
shook
and
shook
the
sound
she
made
was
like
a
sob
going
down
and
a
laugh
coming
up
i
not
crying
she
said
because
it
so
hard
but
b
because
the
idea
is
so
f
funny
f
f
funny
said
our
uncle
peter
it
preposterous
gro
tesque
it
it
fantastic
he
began
to
walk
very
fast
from
the
to
the
window
and
from
the
window
back
to
the
again
it
was
till
he
stubbed
his
toe
twice
on
a
toy
ferris
wheel
that
the
twinkle
came
back
to
his
eyes
carol
he
said
ruthy
in
consideration
of
the
reduced
circumstances
in
which
this
very
pleasant
lady
finds
herself
do
you
think
that
you
could
afford
to
offer
her
a
reduced
price
on
the
dog
your
original
profit
on
the
deal
being
as
noted
the
lady
jumped
to
her
feet
oh
no
no
no
she
said
not
for
a
moment
fifty
dollars
is
what
i
offered
and
fifty
dollars
it
shall
be
all
dogs
i
sure
are
worth
fifty
dollars
especially
if
they
do
sleep
why
all
the
other
dogs
that
people
brought
me
did
nothing
except
sleep
on
my
sofas
in
my
chairs
under
my
tables
night
or
day
you
could
drop
even
so
much
as
a
handkerchief
on
the
floor
that
one
or
the
other
of
them
did
camp
right
down
and
go
to
sleep
on
it
oh
no
no
no
protested
the
lady
whatever
my
faults
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
and
whatever
your
faults
my
dear
madam
said
our
uncle
peter
they
are
essentially
feminine
and
therefore
enchanting
it
is
only
when
ladies
ape
the
faults
of
men
that
men
resent
the
same
your
extravagant
indulgency
he
bowed
towards
the
toys
your
absolute
innocence
of
all
business
guile
he
bowed
towards
tiger
lily
nerves
strung
so
exquisitely
that
the
slightest
the
slightest
the
lady
shivered
her
clothes
like
a
black
frost
it
was
advice
that
i
was
looking
for
not
compliments
she
said
oh
ho
said
uncle
peter
i
infinitely
more
adept
with
advice
than
i
am
with
compliments
the
lady
looked
a
little
bit
surprised
she
frowned
it
my
little
boy
that
i
want
advice
about
she
said
what
is
the
best
thing
i
can
do
for
him
our
uncle
peter
looked
at
the
ceiling
he
looked
at
the
rug
he
looked
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
but
it
seemed
to
satisfy
him
most
to
look
at
the
lady
face
u
m
m
he
said
u
m
that
is
an
easy
question
to
answer
unless
you
willing
first
to
answer
a
question
of
mine
ask
any
question
you
want
to
said
the
lady
u
m
m
said
our
uncle
peter
all
over
again
u
m
m
um
m
m
u
m
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
patience
said
our
uncle
peter
to
bring
up
a
little
unless
every
time
naughty
you
can
say
to
yourself
even
so
think
what
a
good
man
his
father
grew
to
be
or
every
time
he
good
you
fair
enough
to
admit
that
his
naughty
father
was
once
as
nice
as
this
all
the
twinkle
went
suddenly
out
of
our
uncle
peter
eyes
it
left
them
looking
narrow
he
made
a
quick
glance
at
carol
he
made
a
quick
glance
at
me
he
seemed
very
pleased
that
we
were
so
busy
looking
at
a
map
of
bermuda
he
stepped
a
little
nearer
to
the
lady
his
voice
sounded
funny
were
you
were
you
very
fond
of
the
little
boy
father
he
said
the
lady
face
went
blazing
like
a
flame
out
of
her
black
clothes
it
was
like
a
white
flame
that
it
went
blazing
her
eyes
looked
screaming
how
dare
you
she
said
you
have
no
business
what
if
i
was
what
if
i
was
all
the
scream
in
her
eyes
fell
down
her
throat
into
a
whisper
suppose
suppose
i
was
she
whispered
then
indeed
i
can
give
you
advice
said
our
uncle
peter
the
lady
reached
out
a
hand
to
the
to
make
herself
more
steady
what
what
is
it
she
said
our
uncle
peter
looked
funnier
and
funnier
it
was
like
christmas
that
he
looked
nor
fourth
of
july
nor
even
like
when
we
got
the
mumps
or
the
measles
it
was
like
easter
sunday
that
he
looked
there
was
no
twinkle
in
it
nor
any
smoke
nor
even
paper
dolls
but
just
shiningness
his
voice
was
all
shiningness
too
if
it
had
been
you
never
could
have
heard
it
he
made
his
words
so
little
it
almost
a
year
now
he
said
since
our
eyes
first
tried
your
best
to
hide
from
me
but
you
could
do
fate
had
other
ideas
in
a
chance
encounter
on
the
street
that
day
on
the
ferry
boat
your
funny
little
in
the
paper
quite
suddenly
our
uncle
peter
straightened
up
like
a
soldier
and
spoke
right
out
loud
again
about
your
little
boy
he
said
my
advice
about
your
little
boy
it
being
indeed
so
impossible
madam
for
a
woman
to
bring
up
a
little
boy
very
successfully
unless
she
did
love
his
father
my
advice
to
you
is
that
without
the
slightest
unnecessary
delay
you
proceed
to
get
him
a
father
whom
you
could
love
whereupon
as
people
always
say
in
books
our
uncle
peter
turned
upon
his
heel
and
started
for
the
door
the
lady
swooned
into
her
chair
our
uncle
peter
had
to
get
a
glass
of
water
to
her
i
ran
for
a
fan
it
bursted
my
garter
when
our
uncle
peter
tried
to
mend
it
he
swore
instead
the
lady
came
out
of
her
swoon
without
an
instant
hesitation
here
at
least
she
said
is
something
that
i
know
enough
to
do
her
mouth
was
full
of
scorn
and
pins
it
was
with
pins
that
she
knew
enough
to
do
it
our
uncle
peter
looked
very
humble
the
lady
patted
my
knees
little
girls
are
so
much
easier
to
manage
than
little
boys
she
said
i
do
seem
to
understand
little
boys
nor
big
boys
either
said
our
uncle
peter
he
said
it
with
gruffness
it
sounded
cross
perhaps
i
do
want
to
understand
them
said
the
lady
our
uncle
peter
cheeks
got
sort
of
red
suit
yourself
my
dear
madam
he
said
and
started
for
the
door
he
picked
up
my
hat
and
put
it
on
carol
carol
head
looked
pretty
astonished
he
took
carol
cap
and
put
it
on
my
head
he
handed
us
our
coats
upside
all
our
pennies
and
treasures
fell
out
on
the
floor
he
snatched
up
the
little
boy
gloves
by
mistake
and
thrust
them
into
his
own
pockets
the
lady
collected
everything
again
and
them
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
funny
not
very
funny
but
just
a
little
she
looked
at
carol
sort
of
specially
oh
my
dear
child
she
said
i
hope
you
did
mind
because
dicky
called
you
a
carol
did
mind
he
minded
very
much
i
could
tell
by
the
way
he
carried
his
ears
they
looked
very
stately
our
uncle
peter
whirled
round
in
the
his
ears
looked
pretty
stately
too
all
the
men
in
our
family
he
said
aim
to
meet
the
exigencies
of
life
sensibly
the
lady
seemed
to
consider
the
fact
quite
a
long
time
before
she
smiled
again
oh
very
well
she
said
if
the
uncle
really
is
as
sensible
as
the
nephew
perhaps
he
will
consent
to
leave
the
children
here
with
me
instead
of
bearing
them
off
to
the
confusion
and
general
of
hotels
our
uncle
peter
face
fairly
burst
into
relief
oh
do
you
really
mean
that
he
cried
it
is
their
infernal
buttons
that
makes
most
of
the
worry
and
their
prayers
what
is
the
difference
anyway
between
a
morning
and
an
evening
prayer
and
this
awful
responsibility
about
cereals
and
how
in
the
world
do
you
make
sure
about
their
necks
oh
those
are
the
things
i
know
perfectly
said
the
lady
all
the
nice
gentle
things
our
uncle
peter
began
to
strut
again
oh
pshaw
he
said
it
only
the
outdoor
things
that
are
really
important
how
to
climb
mountains
how
to
stop
a
runaway
horse
how
to
smother
a
grass
fire
it
put
the
lady
all
in
a
flutter
oh
pshaw
said
our
uncle
peter
that
nothing
the
very
first
instant
you
hear
the
maddened
hoofs
on
the
pavement
you
place
yourself
thus
and
thus
and
the
lady
tried
to
explain
to
him
the
difference
between
a
morning
and
an
evening
prayer
now
at
night
of
course
she
explained
everything
is
so
very
lonely
that
our
uncle
peter
did
seem
to
care
at
all
how
lonely
it
was
the
instant
you
see
the
horses
nostrils
jump
cried
our
uncle
peter
it
sounded
pretty
muddled
to
me
personally
insisted
the
lady
i
consider
a
rather
soft
sponge
best
for
the
neck
so
that
with
your
hands
clutched
like
a
vise
on
either
side
of
the
mouth
cried
our
uncle
peter
you
can
saw
up
and
down
with
all
the
violence
at
your
command
now
in
fighting
a
grass
fire
it
craft
not
might
that
you
need
in
that
case
of
course
two
hours
if
you
using
a
double
boiler
explained
the
lady
but
many
people
consider
a
rapider
action
more
digestible
i
suppose
my
dear
lady
let
me
finish
my
explanation
said
our
uncle
peter
but
i
want
to
finish
mine
said
the
lady
our
legs
got
pretty
tired
waiting
for
all
the
explanations
to
get
up
again
it
was
nine
before
the
lady
gave
our
uncle
peter
a
cup
of
hot
chocolate
and
turned
him
out
doors
just
like
a
dog
said
our
uncle
peter
we
heard
him
say
it
across
his
shoulder
as
he
went
down
the
steps
it
made
the
lady
laugh
a
little
it
was
warm
milk
in
two
great
blue
bowls
that
she
gave
us
just
like
kittens
we
thought
it
was
we
heard
the
little
boy
feet
come
up
the
stairs
we
heard
tiger
lily
along
behind
him
the
little
boy
looked
very
full
of
chicken
and
joyfulness
so
did
tiger
lily
cook
says
i
got
to
romp
him
he
said
every
day
twice
every
day
a
hundred
times
some
days
out
doors
too
not
just
in
parks
parks
are
good
enough
for
cats
but
in
real
fields
else
die
almost
as
though
he
was
frightened
he
stooped
down
suddenly
and
laid
his
little
ear
on
tiger
lily
soft
breast
he
alive
now
he
boasted
you
can
hear
his
heart
nibbling
he
threw
back
his
little
head
and
laughed
and
laughed
and
clapped
his
hands
he
took
tiger
lily
by
the
collar
and
led
him
over
to
the
table
by
the
window
he
climbed
up
on
the
table
and
pulled
tiger
lily
after
him
tiger
lily
was
frightened
but
not
too
much
he
felt
proud
his
ears
looked
fluffy
his
back
was
shining
silk
his
tail
hung
down
across
the
edge
of
the
table
like
a
plume
far
off
in
the
city
streets
somewhere
there
was
a
noise
that
trolly
cars
make
when
they
climbing
up
a
hill
and
the
switch
is
too
hard
for
them
it
was
a
sour
sound
tiger
lily
started
to
make
a
little
quiver
in
his
back
the
little
boy
threw
his
arm
around
him
a
mouse
nibbled
in
the
wall
tiger
lily
cocked
his
head
to
listen
but
kissed
the
little
boy
cheek
instead
it
was
a
nice
kiss
but
wet
the
little
boy
laughed
right
out
loud
way
down
on
the
very
tip
end
of
tiger
lily
plumey
tail
about
two
hairs
wagged
when
the
little
boy
saw
it
his
face
went
all
shining
he
threw
both
arms
around
tiger
lily
neck
t
tiger
lily
little
boy
he
said
t
t
something
funny
happened
to
his
mouth
it
was
a
yawn
that
did
seem
to
know
just
what
to
do
about
it
nothing
in
all
the
world
felt
lonely
any
more
except
me
the
lady
put
me
to
bed
carol
put
himself
to
bed
all
except
the
knots
in
his
shoestrings
we
went
to
sleep
pretty
soon
it
was
morning
and
we
went
home
our
uncle
peter
changed
a
lot
of
our
into
nickles
so
it
would
jingle
we
sounded
like
it
felt
rich
our
uncle
peter
held
us
very
tight
by
the
hands
all
the
way
he
said
he
was
afraid
we
might
step
into
something
wet
and
sink
it
had
been
wednesday
when
we
went
away
it
was
only
thursday
when
we
got
home
it
seemed
later
than
that
our
mother
was
very
glad
to
see
us
so
was
our
father
the
tame
crow
flew
down
out
of
the
maple
tree
and
sat
on
carol
head
our
tame
coon
came
out
of
the
hole
under
the
piazza
and
sniffed
at
our
heels
the
posie
bed
in
front
of
the
house
was
blue
with
violets
the
white
spirea
bush
foamed
like
a
wave
against
the
window
in
spite
of
our
absence
nothing
seemed
changed
we
gave
our
father
a
dollar
of
our
money
to
buy
some
tulips
we
gave
our
mother
a
dollar
to
spend
any
way
she
wanted
to
we
put
the
rest
of
it
in
a
book
it
was
a
savings
bank
book
that
we
put
it
into
for
your
old
age
our
father
said
our
father
eyes
had
twinkles
in
them
i
hope
you
thanked
your
uncle
peter
properly
he
said
for
what
said
our
uncle
peter
our
father
jingled
the
twenty
nickles
in
his
hand
for
all
favors
he
said
our
uncle
peter
said
he
was
perfectly
repaid
he
made
a
frown
at
my
father
when
came
i
climbed
up
into
my
mother
lap
and
told
her
all
about
it
the
house
the
cocoa
the
toy
ferris
wheel
the
blue
daisies
on
the
stair
carpet
the
pigeon
that

on
my
in
the
morning
the
splashy
way
tiger
lily
lapped
his
milk

will
be
interesting
said
my
mother
to
see
what
we
hear
from
tiger
lily

goes
on

on
pretty
quickly
pansies

kittens
and
august

was
till
almost

from
tiger
lily
or
the
little
boy
again
when
the
letter
came
it
was
from
the
little
boy
but
it
was
the
lady
who
wrote
it
we
thought
her
writing
would
be
all
black
and
sorrowful
but
it
was
instead
with
all
the
ends
of
her
letters
quirked
up
with
surprise
like
her
face
only
prancier
my
dear

friends

our

up
across
the
top
of
the
letter
it
was
at
my
father
