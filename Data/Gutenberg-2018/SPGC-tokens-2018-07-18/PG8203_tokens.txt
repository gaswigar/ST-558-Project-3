by
william
dean
howells
introduction
howells
has
written
a
long
series
of
poems
novels
sketches
stories
and
essays
and
has
been
perhaps
the
most
continuous
worker
in
the
literary
art
among
american
writers
he
was
born
at
martin
perry
belmont
county
ohio
march
and
the
experiences
of
his
early
life
have
been
delightfully
told
by
himself
in
boy
year
in
a
log
and
literary
these
books
which
seem
like
pastimes
in
the
midst
of
howells
serious
work
are
likely
to
live
long
not
only
as
playful
autobiographic
records
but
as
vivid
pictures
of
life
in
the
middle
west
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
boy
lived
in
a
home
where
frugality
was
the
law
of
economy
but
where
high
ideals
of
noble
living
were
cheerfully
maintained
and
the
very
occupations
of
the
household
tended
to
stimulate
literary
activity
he
read
voraciously
and
with
an
instinctive
scent
for
what
was
great
and
permanent
in
literature
and
in
his
father
learned
to
set
type
and
soon
to
make
contributions
to
the
local
journals
he
went
to
the
state
capitol
to
report
the
proceedings
of
the
legislature
and
before
he
was
had
become
news
editor
of
the
of
columbus
ohio
but
at
the
same
time
he
had
given
clear
intimations
of
his
literary
skill
and
had
contributed
several
poems
to
the
his
introduction
to
literature
was
in
the
stirring
days
just
before
the
war
for
the
union
and
he
had
a
generous
enthusiasm
for
the
great
principles
which
were
then
at
stake
yet
the
political
leaven
chiefly
caused
the
bread
he
was
baking
to
rise
and
his
native
genius
was
distinctly
for
work
in
creative
literature
his
contribution
to
the
political
writing
of
the
day
besides
his
newspaper
work
was
a
small
campaign
life
of
lincoln
and
shortly
after
the
incoming
of
the
first
republican
administration
he
received
the
appointment
of
consul
at
venice
at
venice
he
remained
from
to
and
these
years
may
fairly
be
taken
as
standing
for
his
university
training
he
carried
with
him
to
europe
some
conversance
with
french
german
spanish
and
italian
and
an
insatiable
thirst
for
literature
in
these
languages
naturally
now
he
concentrated
his
attention
on
the
italian
language
and
literature
but
after
all
he
was
not
made
for
a
microscopic
or
encyclopaedic
scholar
least
of
all
for
a
pedant
what
he
was
looking
for
in
literature
though
he
scarcely
so
stated
it
to
himself
at
the
time
was
human
life
and
it
was
this
acquaintance
he
was
acquiring
with
life
in
another
circumstance
that
constituted
his
real
training
in
literature
to
pass
from
ohio
straight
to
italy
with
the
merest
alighting
by
the
way
in
new
york
and
boston
was
to
be
transported
from
one
world
to
another
but
he
carried
with
him
a
mind
which
had
already
become
naturalized
in
the
large
world
of
history
and
men
through
the
literature
in
which
he
had
steeped
his
mind
no
one
can
read
the
record
of
the
books
he
had
revelled
in
and
observe
the
agility
with
which
he
was
absorbed
successively
in
books
of
greatly
varying
character
without
perceiving
how
wide
open
were
the
windows
of
his
mind
and
as
the
light
streamed
in
from
all
these
heavens
so
the
inmate
looked
out
with
unaffected
interest
on
the
views
spread
before
him
thus
it
was
that
italy
and
venice
in
particular
afforded
him
at
once
the
greatest
delight
and
also
the
surest
test
of
his
growing
power
the
swift
observation
he
had
shown
in
literature
became
an
equally
rapid
survey
of
all
these
novel
forms
before
him
the
old
life
embedded
in
this
historic
country
became
the
book
whose
leaves
he
turned
but
he
looked
with
the
greatest
interest
and
most
sympathetic
scrutiny
on
that
which
passed
before
his
eyes
it
was
novel
it
was
quaint
it
was
filled
with
curious
unexpected
betrayals
of
human
nature
but
it
was
above
all
real
actual
a
thing
to
be
touched
and
as
it
were
fondled
by
hands
that
were
deft
by
nature
and
were
quickly
becoming
more
skilful
by
use
howells
began
to
write
letters
home
which
were
printed
in
the
daily
and
grew
easily
into
a
book
which
still
remains
in
the
minds
of
many
of
his
readers
the
freshest
of
all
his
writings
this
was
followed
shortly
by
in
which
howells
gathered
his
observations
made
in
going
from
place
to
place
in
italy
a
good
many
years
later
after
returning
to
the
country
of
his
affection
he
wrote
a
third
book
of
a
similar
character
under
the
title
of
but
his
use
of
italy
in
literature
was
not
confined
to
books
of
travels
he
made
and
published
studies
of
italian
literature
and
he
wove
the
life
of
the
country
into
fiction
in
a
charming
manner
illustrations
may
be
found
in
foregone
one
of
the
happiest
of
his
novels
whose
scene
is
laid
in
venice
in
lady
of
the
and
in
many
slight
sketches
when
howells
returned
to
america
at
the
close
of
his
term
as
consul
he
found
warm
friends
whom
he
had
made
through
his
writings
he
served
for
a
short
time
on
the
staff
of
of
new
york
and
then
was
invited
to
boston
to
take
the
position
of
assistant
editor
of
the
under
fields
this
was
in
and
five
years
later
on
the
retirement
of
fields
he
became
editor
and
remained
in
the
position
until
living
during
this
period
in
cambridge
he
was
not
only
editor
of
the
magazine
he
was
really
its
chief
contributor
any
one
who
takes
the
trouble
to
examine
the
pages
of
the
will
see
how
far
his
work
outnumbers
in
titles
that
of
all
other
contributors
and
the
range
of
his
work
was
great
he
wrote
a
large
proportion
of
the
reviews
of
books
which
in
those
days
constituted
a
marked
feature
of
the
magazine
these
reviews
were
conscientiously
written
and
showed
penetration
and
justice
but
they
had
besides
a
felicitous
and
playful
touch
which
rendered
them
delightful
reading
even
though
one
knew
little
or
cared
little
for
the
book
reviewed
sometimes
though
not
often
he
wrote
poems
but
readers
soon
learned
to
look
with
eagerness
for
a
kind
of
writing
which
seemed
almost
more
individual
with
him
than
any
other
form
of
writing
we
mean
the
humorous
sketches
of
life
in
which
he
took
scenes
of
the
commonest
sort
and
drew
from
them
an
inherent
life
which
most
never
suspected
yet
confessed
the
moment
he
disclosed
it
he
would
do
such
a
thing
as
take
an
excursion
down
the
harbor
or
even
a
ride
to
town
in
a
and
come
back
to
turn
his
experience
into
a
piece
of
genuine
literature
a
number
of
these
pieces
were
collected
into
a
volume
entitled
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
slowly
yet
surely
howells
drew
near
the
great
field
of
and
how
deliberately
he
laid
the
foundations
of
his
art
first
the
graceful
sketch
which
was
hardly
more
than
a
leaf
out
of
his
then
the
blending
of
travel
with
as
in
chance
and
wedding
and
later
stories
of
people
who
moved
about
and
thus
found
the
incidents
which
the
author
had
not
to
invent
as
in
lady
of
the
meanwhile
the
eye
which
had
taken
note
of
surface
effects
was
beginning
to
look
deeper
into
the
springs
of
being
and
the
hand
which
had
described
was
beginning
to
model
figures
also
which
stood
alone
so
there
followed
a
number
of
little
dramatic
sketches
where
the
persons
of
the
drama
carried
on
their
little
play
and
since
they
were
not
on
a
stage
before
the
spectator
the
author
constructed
a
sort
of
literary
stage
for
the
reader
that
is
to
say
he
supplied
by
paragraphs
what
in
a
regular
play
would
be
stage
directions
this
is
seen
in
such
little
comedies
as
counterfeit
which
indeed
was
put
on
the
stage
but
instead
of
pushing
forward
on
this
line
into
the
field
of
great
drama
howells
contented
himself
with
dexterous
strokes
with
a
fine
pen
so
to
speak
and
created
a
number
of
sparkling
farces
like
parlor
the
real
issue
of
all
this
practice
in
the
dramatic
art
was
to
disengage
the
characters
he
created
from
too
close
dependence
on
the
kind
of
circumstance
as
of
travel
which
the
author
did
not
invent
and
to
give
them
substantial
life
in
the
working
out
of
the
drama
of
their
spiritual
evolution
thus
by
the
time
he
was
released
from
editorial
work
howells
was
ready
for
the
novel
and
he
gave
to
readers
such
examples
of
art
as
modern
rise
of
silas
and
that
most
important
of
all
his
novels
hazard
of
new
by
the
time
this
last
novel
was
written
he
had
become
thoroughly
interested
not
merely
in
the
men
women
and
children
about
him
but
in
that
mysterious
complex
order
named
by
us
society
with
its
roots
matted
together
as
in
a
swamp
and
seeming
to
many
to
be
sucking
up
maleficent
miasmatic
vapors
from
the
soil
in
which
it
was
rooted
like
many
another
lover
of
his
kind
he
has
sought
to
trace
the
evils
of
individual
life
to
their
source
in
this
composite
order
and
to
guess
at
the
mode
by
which
society
shall
right
itself
and
drink
up
healthy
and
virtues
from
the
soil
but
it
must
not
be
inferred
that
his
novels
and
other
literary
work
have
been
by
any
means
exclusively
concerned
with
the
reconstruction
of
the
social
order
he
has
indeed
experimented
with
this
theme
but
he
has
always
had
a
sane
interest
in
life
as
he
sees
it
and
with
the
increasing
scope
of
his
observation
he
has
drawn
his
figures
from
a
larger
world
which
includes
indeed
the
world
in
which
he
first
began
to
find
his
characters
and
their
action
not
long
after
retiring
from
the
he
went
to
live
in
new
york
and
varied
his
american
experience
with
frequent
travels
and
continued
residence
in
europe
for
a
while
he
maintained
a
department
in
where
he
gave
expression
to
his
views
on
literature
and
the
dramatic
art
and
for
a
short
period
returned
to
the
editorial
life
in
conducting
later
he
entered
also
the
field
of
lecturing
and
thus
further
extended
the
range
of
his
observation
for
many
years
howells

the
writer

in

was
made
president
of
the
american
academy
of
arts
and

howells
death
occurred
may
this
in
fine
is
the
most
summary
statement
of
his
career
in
literature
that
he
has
been
a
keen
and
sympathetic
observer
of
life
and
has
caught
its
character
not
like
a
reporter
going
about
with
a
kodak
and
snapping
it
aimlessly
at
any
conspicuous
object
but
like
an
alert
artist
who
goes
back
to
his
studio
after
a
walk
and
sets
down
his
comments
on
what
he
has
seen
in
quick
accurate
sketches

i
the
village
stood
on
a
wide
plain
and
around
it
rose
the
mountains
they
were
green
to
their
tops
in
summer
and
in
winter
white
through
their
serried
pines
and
drifting
mists
but
at
every
season
serious
and
beautiful
furrowed
with
hollow
shadows
and
taking
the
light
on
masses
and
stretches
of
crag
the
river
swam
through
the
plain
in
long
curves
and
slipped
away
at
last
through
an
unseen
pass
to
the
southward
tracing
a
score
of
miles
in
its
course
over
a
space
that
measured
but
three
or
four
the
plain
was
very
fertile
and
its
features
if
few
and
of
purely
utilitarian
beauty
had
a
rich
luxuriance
and
there
was
a
tropical
riot
of
vegetation
when
the
sun
of
july
beat
on
those
northern
fields
they
waved
with
corn
and
oats
to
the
feet
of
the
mountains
and
the
potatoes
covered
a
vast
acreage
with
the
lines
of
their
intense
coarse
green
the
meadows
were
deep
with
english
grass
to
the
banks
of
the
river
that
doubling
and
returning
upon
itself
still
marked
its
way
with
a
dense
fringe
of
alders
and
white
birches
but
winter
was
full
half
the
year
the
snow
began
at
thanksgiving
and
fell
snow
upon
snow
till
fast
day
thawing
between
the
storms
and
packing
harder
and
harder
against
the
in
the
spring
when
it
covered
the
ground
in
solid
levels
three
feet
high
and
lay
heaped
in
drifts
that
defied
the
sun
far
into
may
when
it
did
not
snow
the
weather
was
keenly
clear
and
commonly
very
still
then
the
landscape
at
noon
had
a
stereoscopic
glister
under
the
high
sun
that
burned
in
a
heaven
without
a
cloud
and
at
setting
stained
the
sky
and
the
white
waste
with
freezing
pink
and
violet
on
such
days
the
farmers
and
lumbermen
came
in
to
the
village
stores
and
made
a
stiff
and
feeble
stir
about
their
doorways
and
the
school
children
gave
the
street
a
little
life
and
color
as
they
went
to
and
from
the
academy
in
their
red
and
blue
woollens
four
times
a
day
the
mill
the
shrill
wheeze
of
whose
saws
had
become
part
of
the
habitual
silence
blew
its
whistle
for
the
hands
to
begin
and
leave
off
work
in
blasts
that
seemed
to
shatter
themselves
against
the
thin
air
but
otherwise
an
arctic
quiet
prevailed
behind
the
black
boles
of
the
elms
that
swept
the
vista
of
the
street
with
the
fine
gray
tracery
of
their
boughs
stood
the
houses
in
the
accumulating
drifts
through
which
each
householder
kept
a
path
cut
from
his
doorway
to
the
road
white
and
clean
as
if
hewn
out
of
marble
some
cross
streets
straggled
away
east
and
west
with
the
poorer
dwellings
but
this
that
followed
the
northward
and
southward
reach
of
the
plain
was
the
main
thoroughfare
and
had
its
own
impressiveness
with
those
square
white
houses
which
they
build
so
large
in
northern
new
england
they
were
all
kept
in
scrupulous
repair
though
here
and
there
the
frost
and
thaw
of
many
winters
had
heaved
a
fence
out
of
plumb
and
threatened
the
poise
of
the
monumental
urns
of
painted
pine
on
the
they
had
blinds
of
a
color
harmonious
with
that
of
the
funereal
evergreens
in
their
dooryards
and
they
themselves
had
taken
the
tone
of
the
snowy
landscape
as
if
by
the
operation
of
some
such
law
as
blanches
the
animals
of
the
north
they
seemed
proper
to
its
desolation
while
some
houses
of
more
modern
taste
painted
to
a
warmer
tone
looked
with
their
mansard
roofs
and
piazzas
and
balconies
intrusive
and
alien
at
one
end
of
the
street
stood
the
academy
with
its
classic
façade
and
its
belfry
midway
was
the
hotel
with
the
stores
the
and
the
churches
and
at
the
other
extreme
one
of
the
square
white
mansions
stood
advanced
from
the
rank
of
the
rest
at
the
top
of
a
valley
defining
itself
against
the
mountain
beyond
so
sharply
that
it
seemed
as
if
cut
out
of
its
dark
wooded
side
it
was
from
the
gate
before
this
house
distinct
in
the
pink
light
which
the
sunset
had
left
that
on
a
saturday
evening
in
february
a
cutter
gay
with
robes
dashed
away
and
came
musically
clashing
down
the
street
under
the
naked
elms
for
the
women
who
sat
with
their
work
at
the
windows
on
either
side
of
the
way
hesitating
whether
to
light
their
lamps
and
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
of
the
outer
cold
for
the
latest
glimmer
of
the
day
the
passage
of
this
vehicle
was
a
vexation
little
short
of
grievous
every
movement
on
the
street
was
precious
to
them
and
with
all
the
keenness
of
their
starved
curiosity
these
captives
of
the
winter
could
not
make
out
the
people
in
the
cutter
afterward
it
was
a
mortification
to
them
that
they
should
not
have
thought
at
once
of
bartley
hubbard
and
marcia
gaylord
they
had
seen
him
go
up
toward
squire
gaylord
house
half
an
hour
before
and
they
now
blamed
themselves
for
not
reflecting
that
of
course
he
was
going
to
take
marcia
over
to
the
church
sociable
at
lower
equity
their
identity
being
established
other
little
proofs
of
it
reproached
the
inquirers
but
these
perturbed
spirits
were
at
peace
and
the
lamps
were
out
in
the
houses
where
the
smell
of
rats
in
the
wainscot
and
of
potatoes
in
the
cellar
strengthened
with
the
growing
night
when
bartley
and
marcia
drove
back
through
the
moonlit
silence
to
her
father
door
here
too
the
windows
were
all
dark
except
for
the
light
that
sparely
glimmered
through
the
parlor
blinds
and
the
young
man
slackened
the
pace
of
his
horse
as
if
to
still
the
bells
some
distance
away
from
the
gate
the
girl
took
the
hand
he
offered
her
when
he
dismounted
at
the
gate
and
as
she
jumped
from
the
cutter
wo
you
come
in
she
asked
i
guess
i
can
blanket
my
horse
and
stand
him
under
the
answered
the
young
man
going
around
to
the
animal
head
and
leading
him
away
when
he
returned
to
the
door
the
girl
opened
it
as
if
she
had
been
listening
for
his
step
and
she
now
stood
holding
it
ajar
for
him
to
enter
and
throwing
the
light
upon
the
threshold
from
the
lamp
which
she
lifted
high
in
the
other
hand
the
action
brought
her
figure
in
relief
and
revealed
the
outline
of
her
bust
and
shoulders
while
the
lamp
flooded
with
light
the
face
she
turned
to
him
and
again
averted
for
a
moment
as
if
startled
at
some
noise
behind
her
she
thus
showed
a
smooth
low
forehead
lips
and
cheeks
deeply
red
a
softly
rounded
chin
touched
with
a
faint
dimple
and
in
turn
a
nose
short
and
aquiline
her
eyes
were
dark
and
her
dusky
hair
flowed
crinkling
above
her
fine
black
brows
and
vanished
down
the
curve
of
a
lovely
neck
there
was
a
peculiar
charm
in
the
form
of
her
upper
lip
it
was
exquisitely
arched
and
at
the
corners
it
projected
a
little
over
the
lower
lip
so
that
when
she
smiled
it
gave
a
piquant
sweetness
to
her
mouth
with
a
certain
demure
innocence
that
qualified
the
roman
pride
of
her
profile
for
the
rest
her
beauty
was
of
the
kind
that
coming
years
would
only
ripen
and
enrich
at
thirty
she
would
be
even
handsomer
than
at
twenty
and
be
all
the
more
southern
in
her
type
for
the
paling
of
that
northern
color
in
her
cheeks
the
young
man
who
looked
up
at
her
from
the
doorstep
had
a
yellow
mustache
shadowing
either
side
of
his
lip
with
a
broad
sweep
like
a
bird
wing
his
chin
below
his
mouth
failed
to
come
strenuously
forward
his
cheeks
were
filled
to
an
oval
contour
and
his
face
had
otherwise
the
regularity
common
to
americans
his
eyes
a
clouded
gray
and
were
his
most
striking
feature
and
he
gave
her
beauty
a
deliberate
look
from
them
as
he
lightly
stamped
the
snow
from
his
feet
and
pulled
the
gloves
from
his
long
hands
come
in
she
whispered
coloring
with
pleasure
under
his
gaze
and
she
made
haste
to
shut
the
door
after
him
with
a
luxurious
impatience
of
the
cold
she
led
the
way
into
the
room
from
which
she
had
come
and
set
down
the
lamp
on
the
corner
of
the
piano
while
he
slipped
off
his
overcoat
and
swung
it
over
the
end
of
the
sofa
they
drew
up
chairs
to
the
stove
in
which
the
smouldering
fire
revived
by
the
opened
draft
roared
and
snapped
it
was
midnight
as
the
sharp
strokes
of
a
wooden
clock
declared
from
the
kitchen
and
they
were
alone
together
and
all
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
were
asleep
the
situation
scarcely
conceivable
to
another
civilization
is
so
common
in
ours
where
youth
commands
its
fate
and
trusts
solely
to
itself
that
it
may
be
said
to
be
characteristic
of
the
new
england
civilization
wherever
it
keeps
its
simplicity
it
was
not
stolen
or
clandestine
it
would
have
interested
every
one
but
would
have
shocked
no
one
in
the
village
if
the
whole
village
had
known
it
all
that
a
girl
parents
ordinarily
exacted
was
that
they
should
not
be
waked
up
ugh
said
the
girl
it
seems
as
if
i
never
should
get
she
leaned
forward
and
stretched
her
hands
toward
the
stove
and
he
presently
rose
from
the
in
which
he
sat
somewhat
lower
than
she
and
lifted
her
sack
to
throw
it
over
her
shoulders
but
he
put
it
down
and
took
up
his
overcoat
allow
my
coat
the
pleasure
he
said
with
the
ease
of
a
man
who
is
not
too
far
lost
to
be
really
flattering
much
obliged
to
the
coat
she
replied
shrugging
herself
into
it
and
pulling
the
collar
close
about
her
throat
i
wonder
you
did
put
it
on
the
sorrel
you
could
have
tied
the
sleeves
around
her
shall
i
tie
them
around
yours
he
leaned
forward
from
the
low
into
which
he
had
sunk
again
and
made
a
feint
at
what
he
had
proposed
but
she
drew
back
with
a
gay
no
and
added
some
day
father
says
that
sorrel
will
be
the
death
of
us
he
says
it
a
bad
color
for
a
horse
they
always
ugly
and
when
they
get
heated
they
you
never
seem
to
be
very
much
frightened
when
you
riding
after
the
sorrel
said
bartley
oh
i
great
faith
in
your
thanks
but
i
do
believe
in
this
notion
about
a
horse
being
vicious
because
he
of
a
certain
color
if
your
father
did
believe
in
it
i
should
call
it
a
superstition
but
the
squire
has
no
i
do
know
about
that
said
the
girl
i
do
think
he
likes
to
see
the
new
moon
over
his
left
i
beg
his
pardon
then
returned
bartley
i
ought
to
have
said
religions
the
squire
has
no
the
young
fellow
had
a
rich
caressing
voice
and
a
securely
winning
manner
which
comes
from
the
habit
of
easily
pleasing
in
this
charming
tone
and
with
this
delightful
insinuation
he
often
said
things
that
hurt
but
with
such
a
humorous
glance
from
his
softly
shaded
eyes
that
people
felt
in
some
sort
flattered
at
being
taken
into
the
joke
even
while
they
winced
under
it
the
girl
seemed
to
wince
as
if
in
spite
of
her
familiarity
with
the
fact
it
wounded
her
to
have
her
father
scepticism
recognized
just
then
she
said
nothing
and
he
added
i
remember
we
used
to
think
that
a
redheaded
boy
was
on
account
of
his
hair
but
i
do
believe
the
as
we
called
them
were
any
more
fiery
than
the
rest
of
marcia
did
not
answer
at
once
and
then
she
said
with
the
vagueness
of
one
not
greatly
interested
by
the
subject
you
got
a
in
your
office
that
fiery
enough
if
she
anything
like
what
she
used
to
be
when
she
went
to
hannah
morrison
oh
she
is
so
bad
she
pretty
lively
but
she
very
eager
to
learn
the
business
and
i
guess
we
shall
get
along
i
think
she
wants
to
please
she
but
she
must
be
going
on
seventeen
i
dare
say
answered
the
young
man
carelessly
but
with
perfect
intelligence
she
in
her
way
oh
then
you
admire
red
hair
he
perceived
the
anxiety
that
the
girl
pride
could
not
keep
out
of
her
tone
but
he
answered
indifferently
i
a
little
too
near
that
color
myself
i
hear
that
red
hair
coming
into
fashion
but
i
guess
natural
i
should
prefer
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
crushed
the
velvet
collar
of
his
coat
under
her
neck
in
lifting
her
head
to
stare
at
the
mezzotints
and
family
photographs
on
the
walls
while
a
flattered
smile
parted
her
lips
and
there
was
a
little
thrill
of
joy
in
her
voice
i
presume
we
must
be
a
good
deal
behind
the
age
in
everything
at
well
you
know
my
opinion
of
equity
returned
the
young
man
if
i
have
you
here
to
free
my
mind
to
once
in
a
while
i
do
know
what
i
should
she
was
so
proud
to
be
in
the
secret
of
his
discontent
with
the
narrow
world
of
equity
that
she
tempted
him
to
disparage
it
further
by
pretending
to
identify
herself
with
it
i
do
see
why
you
abuse
equity
to
me
i
ve
never
been
anywhere
else
except
those
two
winters
at
school
you
better
look
out
i
might
expose
you
she
threatened
fondly
i
not
afraid
those
two
winters
make
a
great
difference
you
saw
girls
from
other
places
from
augusta
and
bangor
and
well
i
could
see
how
they
were
so
very
different
from
equity
i
dare
say
they
could
either
if
they
judged
from
she
leaned
forward
again
and
begged
for
more
flattery
from
him
with
her
happy
eyes
why
what
make
me
so
different
from
all
the
rest
i
should
really
like
to
oh
you
do
expect
me
to
tell
you
to
your
face
yes
to
my
face
i
do
believe
it
anything
no
it
nothing
that
you
deserve
any
credit
pshaw
cried
the
girl
i
know
you
only
talking
to
make
fun
of
me
how
do
i
know
but
you
make
fun
of
me
to
other
girls
just
as
you
do
of
them
to
me
everybody
says
you
have
i
ever
been
sarcastic
with
you
you
know
i
would
stand
he
made
no
reply
but
she
admired
the
ease
with
which
he
now
turned
from
her
and
took
one
book
after
another
from
the
table
at
his
elbow
saying
some
words
of
ridicule
about
each
it
gave
her
a
still
deeper
sense
of
his
intellectual
command
when
he
finally
discriminated
and
began
to
read
out
a
poem
with
studied
elocutionary
effects
he
read
in
a
low
tone
but
at
last
some
responsive
noises
came
from
the
room
overhead
he
closed
the
book
and
threw
himself
into
an
attitude
of
deprecation
with
his
eyes
cast
up
to
the
ceiling
chicago
he
said
laying
the
book
on
the
table
and
taking
his
knee
between
his
hands
while
he
dazzled
her
by
speaking
from
the
abstraction
of
one
who
has
carried
on
a
train
of
thought
quite
different
from
that
on
which
he
seemed
to
be
intent
chicago
is
the
place
for
me
i
do
think
i
can
stand
equity
much
longer
you
know
that
chum
of
mine
i
told
you
about
he
written
to
me
to
come
out
there
and
go
into
the
law
with
him
at
why
do
you
go
the
girl
forced
herself
to
ask
oh
i
not
ready
yet
should
you
write
to
me
if
i
went
to
chicago
i
do
think
you
find
my
letters
very
interesting
you
would
want
any
news
from
your
letters
would
be
interesting
if
you
gave
me
the
equity
news
but
they
would
if
you
left
it
out
then
you
have
to
write
about
oh
i
do
think
that
would
interest
well
i
feel
almost
like
going
out
to
chicago
to
but
i
have
promised
to
write
yet
said
the
girl
laughing
for
joy
in
his
humor
i
shall
have
to
stay
in
equity
till
you
do
then
better
promise
at
would
that
be
too
much
like
marrying
a
man
to
get
rid
of
him
i
do
think
that
always
such
a
bad
plan
for
the
he
waited
for
her
to
speak
but
she
had
gone
the
length
of
her
tether
in
this
direction
byron
says
love
is
of
man
life
a
thing
apart
is
woman
whole
existence
do
you
believe
that
he
dwelt
upon
her
with
his
tree
look
in
the
happy
embarrassment
with
which
she
let
her
head
droop
i
do
know
she
murmured
i
do
know
anything
about
a
man
it
was
the
woman
i
was
asking
i
do
think
i
competent
to
well
i
tell
you
then
i
think
byron
was
mistaken
my
experience
is
that
when
a
man
is
in
love
there
nothing
else
of
him
that
the
reason
i
kept
out
of
it
altogether
of
late
years
my
advice
is
do
fall
in
love
it
takes
too
much
they
both
laughed
at
this
but
about
corresponding
now
you
have
said
whether
you
would
write
to
me
or
not
will
you
ca
you
wait
and
see
she
asked
slanting
a
look
at
him
which
she
could
not
keep
from
being
fond
no
no
unless
you
wrote
to
me
i
could
go
to
perhaps
i
ought
to
promise
then
at
you
mean
that
you
wish
me
to
you
said
that
you
were
going
you
ought
to
let
anything
stand
in
the
way
of
your
doing
the
best
you
can
for
but
you
would
miss
me
a
little
would
you
you
would
try
to
miss
me
now
and
then
oh
you
are
here
pretty
often
i
do
think
i
should
have
much
difficulty
in
missing
thanks
thanks
i
can
go
with
a
light
heart
now
good
he
made
a
pretence
of
rising
what
are
you
going
at
once
yes
this
very
night
or
or
no
i
ca
go
something
i
was
going
to
do
perhaps
go
to
oh
that
of
course
but
it
was
in
the
afternoon
stop
i
have
it
i
want
you
to
go
with
me
in
the
i
do
know
about
that
marcia
began
but
i
do
said
the
young
man
hold
on
i
put
my
request
in
he
opened
her
portfolio
which
lay
on
the
table
what
elegant
stationery
may
i
use
some
of
this
elegant
stationery
the
letter
is
to
a
lady
to
open
a
correspondence
may
i
she
laughed
her
assent
how
ought
i
to
begin
dearest
miss
marcia
or
just
dear
marcia
which
is
better
you
had
better
not
put
either
but
i
must
you
one
or
the
other
you
know
you
dear
to
your
family
and
you
marcia
you
ca
deny
it
the
only
question
is
whether
you
the
dearest
of
all
the
miss
marcias
i
may
be
mistaken
you
know
we
err
on
the
safe
side
dear
marcia
he
wrote
it
down
that
looks
well
and
it
reads
well
it
looks
very
natural
and
it
reads
like
poetry
blank
verse
there
no
rhyme
for
it
that
i
can
remember
dear
marcia
will
you
go
with
me
afternoon
at
two
sharp
yours
yours
sincerely
or
cordially
or
affectionately
or
what
the
marcia
seems
to
call
for
something
out
of
the
common
i
think
it
had
better
be
he
suggested
it
with
ironical
gravity
and
think
it
had
better
be
protested
the
girl
it
shall
be
then
your
word
is
law
statute
in
such
case
made
and
he
wrote
with
unutterable
devotion
yours
truly
bartley
hubbard
and
read
it
aloud
she
leaned
forward
and
lightly
caught
it
away
from
him
and
made
a
feint
of
tearing
it
he
seized
her
hands
mr
hubbard
she
cried
in
undertone
let
me
go
on
two
conditions
promise
not
to
tear
up
my
letter
and
promise
to
answer
it
in
she
hesitated
long
letting
him
hold
her
wrists
at
last
she
said
well
and
he
released
her
wrists
on
whose
whiteness
his
clasp
left
red
circles
she
wrote
a
single
word
on
the
paper
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
to
him
he
rose
with
it
and
went
around
to
her
side
this
is
very
nice
but
you
have
spelled
it
correctly
anybody
would
say
this
was
no
to
look
at
it
and
you
meant
to
write
yes
take
the
pencil
in
your
hand
miss
gaylord
and
i
will
steady
your
trembling
nerves
so
that
you
can
form
the
characters
stop
at
the
slightest
resistance
on
your
part
i
will
call
out
and
alarm
the
house
or
i
will
he
put
the
pencil
into
her
fingers
and
took
her
soft
fist
into
his
and
changed
the
word
while
she
submitted
helpless
with
her
smothered
laughter
now
the
address
dear
no
no
she
protested
yes
yes
dear
hubbard
there
that
will
do
now
the
signature
yours
i
write
that
i
wo
indeed
oh
yes
you
will
you
only
think
you
wo
yours
gratefully
marcia
gaylord
that
right
the
gaylord
is
not
very
legible
on
account
of
a
slight
tremor
in
the
writer
arm
resulting
from
a
constrained
posture
perhaps
thanks
miss
gaylord
i
will
be
here
promptly
at
the
hour
indicated
the
noises
renewed
themselves
overhead
some
one
seemed
to
be
moving
about
hubbard
laid
his
hand
on
that
of
the
girl
still
resting
on
the
table
and
grasped
it
in
burlesque
alarm
she
could
scarcely
stifle
her
mirth
he
released
her
hand
and
reaching
his
chair
with
a
theatrical
stride
sat
there
cowering
till
the
noises
ceased
then
he
began
to
speak
soberly
in
a
low
voice
he
spoke
of
himself
but
in
application
of
a
lecture
which
they
had
lately
heard
so
that
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
of
the
lecture
it
was
on
the
formation
of
character
and
he
told
of
the
processes
by
which
he
had
formed
his
own
character
they
appeared
very
wonderful
to
her
and
she
marvelled
at
the
ease
with
which
he
dismissed
the
frivolity
of
his
recent
mood
and
was
now
all
seriousness
when
he
came
to
speak
of
the
influence
of
others
upon
him
she
almost
trembled
with
the
intensity
of
her
interest
but
of
all
the
women
i
have
known
marcia
he
said
i
believe
you
have
had
the
strongest
influence
upon
me
i
believe
you
could
make
me
do
anything
but
you
have
always
influenced
me
for
good
your
influence
upon
me
has
been
ennobling
and
she
wished
to
refuse
his
praise
but
her
heart
throbbed
for
bliss
and
pride
in
it
her
voice
dissolved
on
her
lips
they
sat
in
silence
and
he
took
in
his
the
hand
that
she
let
hang
over
the
side
of
her
chair
the
lamp
began
to
burn
low
and
she
found
words
to
say
i
had
better
get
another
but
she
did
not
move
no
do
he
said
i
must
be
going
too
look
at
the
wick
there
marcia
it
scarcely
reaches
the
oil
in
a
little
while
it
will
not
reach
it
and
the
flame
will
die
out
that
is
the
way
the
ambition
to
be
good
and
great
will
die
out
of
me
when
my
life
no
longer
draws
its
inspiration
from
your
this
figure
took
her
imagination
it
seemed
to
her
very
beautiful
and
his
praise
humbled
her
more
and
more
good
night
he
said
in
a
low
sad
voice
he
gave
her
hand
a
last
pressure
and
rose
to
put
on
his
coat
her
admiration
of
his
words
her
happiness
in
his
flattery
filled
her
brain
like
wine
she
moved
dizzily
as
she
took
up
the
lamp
to
light
him
to
the
door
i
have
tired
you
he
said
tenderly
and
he
passed
his
hand
around
her
to
sustain
the
elbow
of
the
arm
with
which
she
held
the
lamp
she
wished
to
resist
but
she
could
not
try
at
the
door
he
bent
down
his
head
and
kissed
her
good
night
dear
good
night
she
panted
and
after
the
door
had
closed
upon
him
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
knob
on
which
his
hand
had
rested
as
she
turned
she
started
to
see
her
father
coming
down
the
stairs
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
he
had
his
black
cravat
tied
around
his
throat
but
no
collar
otherwise
he
had
on
the
rusty
black
clothes
in
which
he
ordinarily
went
about
his
affairs
the
cassimere
pantaloons
the
satin
vest
and
the
which
country
lawyers
still
wore
ten
years
ago
in
preference
to
a
frock
or
sack
he
stopped
on
one
of
the
lower
steps
and
looked
sharply
down
into
her
uplifted
face
and
as
they
stood
confronted
their
consanguinity
came
out
in
vivid
resemblances
and
contrasts
his
high
profile
was
translated
into
the
fine
aquiline
outline
of
hers
the
harsh
rings
of
black
hair
now
grizzled
with
age
which
clustered
tightly
over
his
head
except
where
they
had
retreated
from
his
deeply
seamed
and
wrinkled
forehead
were
the
crinkled
flow
above
her
smooth
white
brow
and
the
line
of
the
bristly
tufts
that
overhung
his
eyes
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
low
arches
above
hers
her
complexion
was
from
her
mother
his
skin
was
dusky
yellow
but
they
had
the
same
mouth
and
hers
showed
how
sweet
his
mouth
must
have
been
in
his
youth
his
eyes
deep
sunk
in
their
cavernous
sockets
had
rekindled
their
dark
fires
in
hers
his
whole
visage
softened
to
her
sex
and
girlish
years
looked
up
at
him
in
his
daughter
face
why
father
did
we
wake
you
no
i
had
been
asleep
at
all
i
was
coming
down
to
read
but
it
time
you
were
in
bed
yes
i
going
now
there
a
good
fire
in
the
parlor
the
old
man
descended
the
remaining
steps
but
turned
at
the
parlor
door
and
looked
again
at
his
daughter
with
a
glance
that
arrested
her
with
her
foot
on
the
lowest
stair
marcia
he
asked
grimly
are
you
engaged
to
bartley
hubbard
the
blood
flashed
up
from
her
heart
into
her
face
like
fire
and
then
as
suddenly
fell
back
again
and
left
her
white
she
let
her
head
droop
and
turn
till
her
eyes
were
wholly
averted
from
him
and
she
did
not
speak
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
she
went
upstairs
to
her
own
room
in
her
shame
she
seemed
to
herself
to
crawl
thither
with
her
father
glance
burning
upon
her
ii
bartley
hubbard
drove
his
sorrel
colt
back
to
the
hotel
stable
through
the
moonlight
and
woke
up
the
hostler
asleep
behind
the
counter
on
a
bunk
covered
with
the
boy
did
not
wake
easily
he
conceived
of
the
affair
as
a
joke
and
bade
bartley
quit
his
fooling
till
the
young
man
took
him
by
his
collar
and
stood
him
on
his
feet
then
he
fumbled
about
the
button
of
the
lamp
turned
low
and
smelling
rankly
and
lit
his
lantern
which
contributed
a
rival
stench
to
the
choking
air
he
kicked
together
the
embers
that
smouldered
on
the
hearth
of
the
franklin
stove
sitting
down
before
it
for
his
greater
convenience
and
having
put
a
fresh
on
the
fire
fell
into
a
doze
with
his
lantern
in
his
hand
look
here
young
man
said
bartley
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
you
had
better
go
out
and
put
that
colt
up
and
leave
this
sleeping
before
the
fire
to
guess
the
colt
can
wait
awhile
grumbled
the
boy
but
he
went
out
all
the
same
and
bartley
looking
through
the
window
saw
his
lantern
wavering
a
yellow
blot
in
the
white
moonshine
toward
the
stable
he
sat
down
in
the
hostler
chair
and
in
his
turn
kicked
the
with
the
heel
of
his
shoe
and
looked
about
the
room
he
had
had
as
he
would
have
said
a
grand
good
time
but
it
had
left
him
hungry
and
the
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
chairs
huddled
around
it
was
suggestive
though
he
knew
that
it
had
been
barrenly
put
there
for
the
convenience
of
the
landlord
friends
who
came
every
night
to
play
whist
with
him
and
that
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
had
ever
been
set
out
on
it
to
interrupt
the
austere
interest
of
the
game
it
was
long
since
there
had
been
anything
on
the
shelves
behind
the
counter
more
cheerful
than
and
fancy
crackers
for
the
children
of
the
summer
boarders
these
dainties
being
out
of
season
the
jars
now
stood
there
empty
the
young
man
waited
in
a
hungry
reverie
in
which
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
was
undergoing
unmerited
suffering
till
the
came
back
now
wide
awake
and
disposed
to
let
the
house
share
his
vigils
as
he
stamped
over
the
floor
in
his
heavy
boots
andy
said
bartley
in
a
pathetic
tone
of
injury
ca
you
scare
me
up
something
to
eat
there
aint
anything
in
the
buttery
but
said
the
boy
he
meant
as
hubbard
knew
and
not
a
pasty
of
meat
and
the
hungry
man
hesitated
well
fetch
it
he
said
finally
i
guess
we
can
warm
it
up
a
little
by
the
coals
he
had
not
been
so
long
out
of
college
but
the
idea
of
this
irregular
supper
when
he
had
once
formed
it
began
to
have
its
fascination
he
took
up
the
broad
and
by
the
time
the
boy
had
shuffled
to
and
from
the
pantry
beyond
the
bartley
had
cleaned
the
shovel
with
a
piece
of
newspaper
and
was
already
heating
it
by
the
embers
which
he
had
raked
out
from
under
the
the
boy
silently
transferred
the
he
had
brought
from
its
plate
to
the
shovel
he
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
to
watch
it
the
pie
began
to
steam
and
send
out
a
savory
odor
he
himself
in
thawing
emitted
a
stronger
and
stronger
smell
of
stable
he
was
not
without
his
disdain
for
the
palate
which
must
have
its
warm
at
midnight
nor
without
his
respect
for
it
either
this
fastidious
taste
must
be
part
of
the
splendor
which
showed
itself
in
hubbard
clothes
and
in
his
and
the
perfection
of
his
and
mustache
the
boy
had
felt
the
original
impression
of
these
facts
deepened
rather
than
effaced
by
custom
they
were
for
every
day
and
not
as
he
had
at
first
conjectured
for
some
great
occasion
only
you
do
suppose
andy
there
is
such
a
thing
as
cold
tea
or
coffee
anywhere
that
we
could
warm
up
asked
bartley
gazing
thoughtfully
at
the
pie
the
boy
shook
his
head
get
you
some
milk
he
said
and
after
he
had
let
the
dispiriting
suggestion
sink
into
the
other
mind
he
added
or
some
oh
bring
on
the
milk
groaned
bartley
but
with
the
relief
that
a
choice
of
evils
affords
the
boy
stumped
away
for
it
and
when
he
came
back
the
young
man
had
got
his
pie
on
the
plate
again
and
had
drawn
his
chair
up
to
the
table
thanks
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
as
the
boy
set
down
the
goblet
of
milk
andy
pulled
his
chair
round
so
as
to
get
an
unrestricted
view
of
a
man
who
ate
his
pie
with
his
fork
as
easily
as
another
would
with
a
knife
that
sister
of
yours
is
a
smart
girl
the
young
man
added
making
deliberate
progress
with
the
pie
the
boy
made
an
inarticulate
sound
of
satisfaction
and
resolved
in
his
heart
to
tell
her
what
hubbard
had
said
she
as
smart
as
time
continued
bartley
this
was
something
concrete
the
boy
knew
he
should
remember
that
comparison
bring
you
anything
else
he
asked
admiring
the
young
skill
in
getting
the
last
flakes
of
the
crust
on
his
fork
the
pie
had
now
vanished
why
there
is
anything
else
is
there
bartley
demanded
with
the
plaintive
dismay
of
a
man
who
fears
he
has
flung
away
his
hunger
upon
one
dish
when
he
might
have
had
something
better
cheese
replied
the
boy
oh
said
bartley
he
reflected
awhile
i
suppose
i
could
toast
a
piece
on
this
fork
but
there
is
any
more
the
boy
took
away
the
plate
and
goblet
and
brought
them
again
replenished
bartley
contrived
to
get
the
cheese
on
his
fork
and
rest
it
against
one
of
the
andirons
so
that
it
would
not
fall
into
the
ashes
when
it
was
done
he
ate
it
as
he
had
eaten
the
pie
without
offering
to
share
his
feast
with
the
boy
there
he
said
yes
andy
if
she
keeps
on
as
she
been
doing
she
wo
have
any
trouble
she
a
bright
he
stretched
his
legs
before
the
fire
again
and
presently
yawned
want
your
lamp
hubbard
asked
the
boy
well
yes
andy
the
young
man
consented
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
go
to
but
when
the
boy
brought
his
lamp
he
still
remained
with
outstretched
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
speaking
of
hannah
morrison
made
him
think
of
marcia
again
and
of
the
way
in
which
she
had
spoken
of
the
girl
he
lolled
his
head
on
one
side
in
such
comfort
as
a
young
man
finds
in
the
conviction
that
a
pretty
girl
is
not
only
fond
of
him
but
is
instantly
jealous
of
any
other
girl
whose
name
is
mentioned
he
smiled
at
the
flame
in
his
reverie
and
the
boy
examined
with
clandestine
minuteness
the
set
and
pattern
of
his
trousers
with
glances
of
reference
and
comparison
to
his
own
there
were
many
things
about
his
relations
with
marcia
gaylord
which
were
calculated
to
give
bartley
satisfaction
she
was
without
question
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
place
and
she
had
more
style
than
any
other
girl
began
to
have
he
liked
to
go
into
a
room
with
marcia
gaylord
it
was
some
pleasure
marcia
was
a
lady
she
had
a
good
education
she
had
been
away
two
years
at
school
and
when
she
came
back
at
the
end
of
the
second
winter
he
knew
that
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
him
at
sight
he
believed
that
he
could
time
it
to
a
second
he
remembered
how
he
had
looked
up
at
her
as
he
passed
and
she
had
reddened
and
tried
to
turn
away
from
the
window
as
if
she
had
not
seen
him
bartley
was
still
free
as
air
but
if
he
could
once
make
up
his
mind
to
settle
down
in
a
hole
like
equity
he
could
have
her
by
turning
his
hand
of
course
she
had
her
drawbacks
like
everybody
she
was
proud
and
she
would
be
jealous
but
with
all
her
pride
and
her
distance
she
had
let
him
see
that
she
liked
him
and
with
not
a
word
on
his
part
that
any
one
could
hold
him
to
hollo
he
cried
with
a
suddenness
that
startled
the
boy
who
had
finished
his
meditation
upon
bartley
trousers
and
was
now
deeply
dwelling
on
his
boots
do
you
like
see
what
sort
of
a
shine
you
can
give
for
he
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
hold
of
the
boy
head
passing
his
fingers
through
the
thick
red
hair
he
said
with
a
grin
of
agreeable
reminiscence
they
emptied
all
the
freckles
they
had
left
into
your
face
did
they
andy
this
free
joking
way
of
bartley
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
him
popular
he
passed
the
time
of
day
and
was
give
and
take
right
along
as
his
admirers
expressed
it
from
the
first
in
a
community
where
his
smartness
had
that
honor
which
gives
us
more
smart
men
to
the
square
mile
than
any
other
country
in
the
world
the
fact
of
his
smartness
had
been
affirmed
and
established
in
the
strongest
manner
by
the
authorities
of
the
college
at
which
he
was
graduated
in
answer
to
the
reference
he
made
to
them
when
negotiating
with
the
committee
in
charge
for
the
place
he
now
held
as
editor
of
the
equity
free
press
the
faculty
spoke
of
the
solidity
and
variety
of
his
acquirements
and
the
distinction
with
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
in
every
branch
of
study
he
had
undertaken
they
added
that
he
deserved
the
greater
credit
because
his
early
disadvantages
as
an
orphan
dependent
on
his
own
exertions
for
a
livelihood
had
been
so
great
that
he
had
entered
college
with
difficulty
and
with
heavy
conditions
this
turned
the
scale
with
a
committee
who
had
all
been
poor
boys
themselves
and
justly
feared
the
encroachments
of
hereditary
aristocracy
they
perhaps
had
their
misgivings
when
the
young
man
in
his
boots
his
gray
trousers
neatly
fitting
over
them
and
his
diagonal
coat
buttoned
high
with
one
button
stood
before
them
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
looked
down
over
his
mustache
at
the
floor
with
sentiments
concerning
their
wisdom
which
they
could
not
explore
they
must
have
resented
the
fashionable
keeping
of
everything
about
him
for
bartley
wore
his
one
suit
as
if
it
were
but
one
of
many
but
when
they
understood
that
he
had
come
by
everything
through
his
own
unaided
smartness
they
could
no
longer
hesitate
one
indeed
still
felt
it
a
duty
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
college
authorities
said
nothing
of
the
young
man
moral
characteristics
in
a
letter
dwelling
so
largely
upon
his
intellectual
qualifications
the
others
referred
this
point
by
a
silent
look
to
squire
gaylord
i
do
know
said
the
squire
as
i
ever
heard
that
a
great
deal
of
morality
was
required
by
a
newspaper
the
rest
laughed
at
the
joke
and
the
squire
continued
but
i
guess
if
he
worked
his
own
way
through
college
as
they
say
that
he
haint
had
time
to
be
up
to
a
great
deal
of
mischief
you
know
it
for
idle
hands
that
the
devil
provides
that
true
as
far
as
it
goes
said
the
doctor
but
it
is
the
whole
truth
the
devil
provides
for
some
busy
hands
there
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
that
the
squire
admitted
the
worst
scamps
i
ever
knew
were
active
fellows
still
industry
is
in
a
favor
if
the
faculty
knew
anything
against
this
young
man
they
would
have
given
us
a
hint
of
it
i
guess
we
had
better
take
him
we
do
better
is
it
a
vote
the
good
opinion
of
bartley
smartness
which
squire
gaylord
had
formed
was
confirmed
some
months
later
by
the
development
of
the
fact
that
the
young
man
did
not
regard
his
management
of
the
equity
free
press
as
a
final
vocation
the
story
went
that
he
lounged
into
the
lawyer
office
one
saturday
afternoon
in
october
and
asked
him
to
let
him
take
his
blackstone
into
the
woods
with
him
he
came
back
with
it
a
few
hours
later
well
sir
said
the
attorney
sardonically
how
much
blackstone
have
you
read
about
forty
pages
answered
the
young
man
dropping
into
one
of
the
empty
chairs
and
hanging
his
leg
over
the
arm
the
lawyer
smiled
and
opening
the
book
asked
half
a
dozen
questions
at
random
bartley
answered
without
changing
his
indifferent
countenance
or
the
careless
posture
he
had
fallen
into
a
sharper
and
longer
examination
followed
the
very
language
seemed
to
have
been
unbrokenly
transferred
to
his
mind
and
he
often
gave
the
author
words
as
well
as
his
ideas
ever
looked
at
this
before
asked
the
lawyer
with
a
keen
glance
at
him
over
his
spectacles
no
said
bartley
gaping
as
if
bored
and
further
relieving
his
weariness
by
stretching
he
was
without
deference
for
any
presence
and
the
old
lawyer
did
not
dislike
him
for
this
he
had
no
deference
himself
you
think
of
studying
law
he
asked
after
a
pause
that
what
i
came
to
ask
you
about
said
bartley
swinging
his
leg
the
elder
recurred
to
his
book
and
put
some
more
questions
then
he
said
do
you
want
to
study
with
me
that
about
the
size
of
he
shut
the
book
and
pushed
it
on
the
table
toward
the
young
man
go
ahead
you
get
along
if
you
do
get
along
too
it
was
in
the
spring
after
this
that
marcia
returned
home
from
her
last
term
at
and
first
saw
him
iii
bartley
woke
on
sunday
morning
with
the
regrets
that
a
supper
of
and
toasted
cheese
is
apt
to
bring
he
woke
from
a
bad
dream
and
found
that
he
had
a
dull
headache
a
cup
of
coffee
relieved
his
pain
but
it
left
him
listless
and
with
a
longing
for
sympathy
which
he
experienced
in
any
mental
or
physical
discomfort
the
frankness
with
which
he
then
appealed
for
compassion
was
one
of
the
things
that
made
people
like
him
he
flung
himself
upon
the
pity
of
the
first
he
met
it
might
be
some
one
to
whom
he
had
said
a
cutting
or
mortifying
thing
at
their
last
encounter
but
bartley
did
not
mind
that
what
he
desired
was
commiseration
and
he
confidingly
ignored
the
past
in
a
trust
that
had
rarely
been
abused
if
his
sarcasm
proved
that
he
was
quick
and
smart
his
recourse
to
those
who
had
suffered
from
it
proved
that
he
did
not
mean
anything
by
what
he
said
it
showed
that
he
was
a
man
of
warm
feelings
and
that
his
heart
was
in
the
right
place
bartley
deplored
his
disagreeable
sensations
to
the
other
boarders
at
breakfast
and
affectionately
excused
himself
to
them
for
not
going
to
church
when
they
turned
into
the
office
and
gathered
there
before
the
franklin
stove
sensible
of
the
day
in
freshly
shaven
chins
and
newly
blacked
boots
the
habit
of
was
so
strong
and
universal
in
equity
that
even
strangers
stopping
at
the
hotel
found
themselves
the
object
of
a
sort
of
hospitable
competition
with
the
members
of
the
different
denominations
who
took
it
for
granted
that
they
would
wish
to
go
somewhere
and
only
suffered
them
a
choice
between
sects
there
was
no
intolerance
in
their
offer
of
pews
but
merely
a
profound
expectation
and
one
might
continue
to
choose
his
place
of
worship
sabbath
after
sabbath
without
offence
this
was
bartley
custom
and
it
had
worked
to
his
favor
rather
than
his
disadvantage
for
in
the
rather
chaotic
liberality
into
which
religious
sentiment
had
fallen
in
equity
it
was
tacitly
conceded
that
the
editor
of
a
paper
devoted
to
the
interests
of
the
whole
town
ought
not
to
be
of
fixed
theological
opinions
religion
there
had
largely
ceased
to
be
a
fact
of
spiritual
experience
and
the
visible
church
flourished
on
condition
of
providing
for
the
social
needs
of
the
community
it
was
practically
held
that
the
salvation
of
one
soul
must
not
be
made
too
depressing
or
the
young
people
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
professors
of
the
sternest
creeds
temporized
with
sinners
and
did
what
might
be
done
to
win
them
to
heaven
by
helping
them
to
have
a
good
time
here
the
church
embraced
and
included
the
world
it
no
longer
frowned
even
upon
social
dancing
a
transgression
once
so
heinous
in
its
eyes
it
opened
its
doors
to
popular
lectures
and
encouraged
secular
music
in
its
basements
where
during
the
winter
oyster
suppers
were
given
in
aid
of
good
objects
the
sunday
school
was
made
particularly
attractive
both
to
the
children
and
the
young
men
and
girls
who
taught
them
not
only
at
thanksgiving
but
at
christmas
and
latterly
even
at
easter
there
were
special
observances
which
the
enterprising
spirits
having
the
welfare
of
the
church
at
heart
tried
to
make
significant
and
agreeable
to
all
and
promotive
of
good
feeling
christenings
and
marriages
in
the
church
were
encouraged
and
elaborately
celebrated
death
alone
though
treated
with
in
emblematic
devices
refused
to
lend
itself
to
the
cheerful
intentions
of
those
who
were
struggling
to
render
the
idea
of
another
and
a
better
world
less
repulsive
in
contrast
with
the
relaxation
and
uncertainty
of
their
doctrinal
aim
the
rude
and
bold
infidelity
of
old
squire
gaylord
had
the
greater
affinity
with
the
mood
of
the
puritanism
they
had
outgrown
but
bartley
hubbard
liked
the
religious
situation
well
enough
he
took
a
leading
part
in
the
entertainments
and
did
something
to
impart
to
them
a
literary
cast
as
in
the
series
of
readings
from
the
poets
which
he
gave
the
first
winter
for
the
benefit
of
each
church
in
turn
at
these
lectures
he
commended
himself
to
the
sober
elders
who
were
troubled
by
the
levity
of
his
behavior
with
young
people
on
other
occasions
by
asking
one
of
the
ministers
to
open
the
exercises
with
prayer
and
another
at
the
close
to
invoke
the
divine
blessing
there
was
no
especial
relevancy
in
this
but
it
pleased
he
kept
himself
from
the
beginning
pretty
constantly
in
the
popular
eye
he
was
a
speaker
at
all
public
meetings
where
his
declamation
was
admired
and
at
private
parties
where
the
congealed
particles
of
village
society
were
united
in
a
frozen
mass
he
was
the
first
to
break
the
ice
and
set
the
angular
fragments
grating
and
grinding
upon
one
another
he
now
went
to
his
room
and
opened
his
desk
with
some
vague
purpose
of
bringing
up
the
arrears
of
his
correspondence
formerly
before
his
interest
in
the
newspaper
had
lapsed
at
all
he
used
to
give
his
sunday
leisure
to
making
selections
and
writing
paragraphs
for
it
but
he
now
let
the
pile
of
exchanges
lie
unopened
on
his
desk
and
began
to
rummage
through
the
letters
scattered
about
in
it
they
were
mostly
from
young
ladies
with
whom
he
had
corresponded
and
some
of
them
enclosed
the
photographs
of
the
writers
doing
their
best
to
look
as
they
hoped
he
might
think
they
looked
they
were
not
but
were
of
that
sort
which
the
laxness
of
our
social
life
invites
young
people
who
have
met
pleasantly
to
exchange
as
long
as
they
like
without
explicit
intentions
on
either
side
they
commit
the
writers
to
nothing
they
are
commonly
without
result
except
in
wasting
time
which
is
hardly
worth
saving
every
one
who
has
lived
the
american
life
must
have
produced
them
in
great
numbers
while
youth
lasts
they
afford
an
excitement
whose
charm
is
hard
to
realize
afterward
bartley
correspondents
were
young
ladies
of
his
college
town
where
he
had
first
begun
to
see
something
of
social
life
in
days
which
he
now
recognized
as
those
of
his
green
youth
they
were
not
so
very
far
removed
in
point
of
time
but
the
experience
of
a
larger
world
in
the
vacation
he
had
spent
with
a
boston
student
had
relegated
them
to
a
moral
remoteness
that
could
not
readily
be
measured
his
friend
was
the
son
of
a
family
who
had
diverted
him
from
the
natural
destiny
of
a
boston
man
at
harvard
and
sent
him
elsewhere
for
sectarian
reasons
they
were
rich
people
devout
in
their
way
and
benevolent
after
a
fashion
of
their
own
and
their
son
always
brought
home
with
him
for
the
holidays
and
other
short
vacations
some
accounted
worthy
of
their
hospitality
through
his
religious
intentions
or
his
intellectual
promise
these
guests
were
indicated
to
the
young
man
by
one
of
the
faculty
and
he
accepted
their
companionship
for
the
time
with
what
perfunctory
civility
he
could
muster
he
and
bartley
had
amused
themselves
very
well
during
that
vacation
the
hallecks
were
not
fashionable
people
but
they
lived
wealthily
they
had
a
coachman
and
an
inside
man
whom
bartley
at
first
treated
with
a
consideration
which
it
afterward
mortified
him
to
think
of
their
house
was
richly
furnished
with
cushioned
seats
dense
carpets
and
heavy
curtains
and
they
were
visited
by
other
people
of
their
denomination
and
of
a
like
abundance
some
of
these
were
infected
with
the
prevailing
culture
of
the
city
and
the
young
ladies
especially
dressed
in
a
style
and
let
fall
ideas
that
filled
the
soul
of
the
country
student
with
wonder
and
worship
he
heard
a
great
deal
of
talk
that
he
did
not
understand
but
he
eagerly
treasured
every
impression
and
pieced
it
out
by
question
or
furtive
observation
into
an
image
often
shrewdly
true
and
often
grotesquely
untrue
to
the
conditions
into
which
he
had
been
dropped
he
civilized
himself
as
rapidly
as
his
light
permitted
there
was
a
great
deal
of
but
he
and
young
halleck
went
also
to
lectures
and
concerts
they
even
went
to
the
opera
and
bartley
with
the
privity
of
his
friend
went
to
the
theatre
halleck
said
that
he
did
not
think
there
was
much
harm
in
a
play
but
that
his
people
stayed
away
for
the
sake
of
the
example
a
reason
that
certainly
need
not
hold
with
bartley
at
the
end
of
the
vacation
he
returned
to
college
leaving
his
measure
with
halleck
tailor
and
his
heart
with
all
the
splendors
and
elegances
of
the
town
he
found
the
ceilings
very
low
and
the
fashions
much
belated
in
the
village
but
he
reconciled
himself
as
well
as
he
could
the
real
stress
came
when
he
left
college
and
the
question
of
doing
something
for
himself
pressed
upon
him
he
intended
to
study
law
but
he
must
meantime
earn
his
living
it
had
been
his
fortune
to
be
left
when
very
young
not
only
an
orphan
but
an
extremely
pretty
child
with
an
exceptional
aptness
for
study
and
he
had
been
better
cared
for
than
if
his
father
and
mother
had
lived
he
had
been
not
only
well
housed
and
fed
and
very
well
dressed
but
pitied
as
an
orphan
and
petted
for
his
beauty
and
talent
while
he
was
always
taught
to
think
of
himself
as
a
poor
boy
who
was
winning
his
own
way
through
the
world
but
when
his
benefactor
proposed
to
educate
him
for
the
ministry
with
a
view
to
his
final
use
in
missionary
work
he
revolted
he
apprenticed
himself
to
the
printer
of
his
village
and
rapidly
picked
up
a
knowledge
of
the
business
so
that
at
nineteen
he
had
laid
by
some
money
and
was
able
to
think
of
going
to
college
there
was
a
fund
in
aid
of
indigent
students
in
the
institution
to
which
he
turned
and
the
faculty
favored
him
he
finished
his
course
with
great
credit
to
himself
and
the
college
and
he
was
naturally
inclined
to
look
upon
what
had
been
done
for
him
earlier
as
an
advantage
taken
of
his
youthful
inexperience
he
rebelled
against
the
memory
of
that
tutelage
in
spite
of
which
he
had
accomplished
such
great
things
if
he
had
not
squandered
his
time
or
fallen
into
vicious
courses
in
circumstances
of
so
much
discouragement
if
he
had
come
out
of
it
all
and
independent
he
knew
whom
he
had
to
thank
for
it
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
that
there
was
some
truth
in
all
this
the
ardor
of
his
satisfaction
cooled
in
the
two
years
following
his
graduation
when
in
intervals
of
teaching
country
schools
he
was
actually
reduced
to
work
at
his
trade
on
a
village
newspaper
but
it
was
as
a
practical
printer
through
the
freemasonry
of
the
craft
that
bartley
heard
of
the
wish
of
the
equity
committee
to
place
the
free
press
in
new
hands
and
he
had
to
be
grateful
to
his
trade
for
a
primary
consideration
from
them
which
his
collegiate
honors
would
not
have
won
him
there
had
not
yet
begun
to
be
that
talk
of
journalism
as
a
profession
which
has
since
prevailed
with
our
collegians
and
if
bartley
had
thought
as
other
collegians
think
of
devoting
himself
to
newspaper
life
he
would
have
turned
his
face
toward
the
city
where
its
prizes
are
won
the
ten
and
fifteen
dollar
reporterships
for
which
a
font
years
course
of
the
classics
is
not
too
costly
a
preparation
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
never
regarded
his
newspaper
as
anything
but
a
by
which
he
was
to
be
carried
over
a
difficult
and
anxious
period
of
his
life
and
enabled
to
attempt
something
worthier
his
powers
he
had
no
illusions
concerning
it
if
he
had
ever
thought
of
journalism
as
a
grand
and
ennobling
profession
these
ideas
had
perished
in
his
experience
in
a
village
he
came
to
his
work
in
equity
with
practical
and
immediate
purposes
which
pleased
the
committee
better
the
paper
had
been
established
some
time
before
in
one
of
those
flurries
of
ambition
which
from
time
to
time
seized
equity
when
its
citizens
reflected
that
it
was
the
central
town
in
the
county
and
yet
not
the
the
question
of
the
removal
of
the
had
periodically
arisen
before
but
it
had
never
been
so
hotly
agitated
as
now
the
paper
had
been
a
happy
thought
of
a
local
politician
whose
conception
of
its
management
was
that
it
might
be
easily
edited
by
a
committee
if
a
printer
could
be
found
to
publish
it
but
a
few
experience
had
made
the
free
press
a
terrible
burden
to
its
founders
it
could
not
be
sustained
and
it
could
not
be
let
die
without
final
disaster
to
the
interests
of
the
town
and
the
committee
began
to
cast
about
for
a
publisher
who
could
also
be
editor
bartley
to
whom
it
fell
could
not
be
said
to
have
thrown
his
heart
and
soul
into
the
work
but
he
threw
all
his
energy
and
he
made
it
more
than
its
friends
could
have
hoped
he
espoused
the
cause
of
equity
in
the
pending
question
with
the
zeal
of
a
and
did
service
no
less
faithful
because
of
the
cynical
quality
latent
in
it
when
the
legislative
decision
against
equity
put
an
end
to
its
ambitious
hopes
for
the
time
being
he
continued
in
control
of
the
paper
with
a
fair
prospect
of
getting
the
property
into
his
own
hands
at
last
and
with
some
growing
question
in
his
mind
whether
after
all
it
might
not
be
as
easy
for
him
to
go
into
politics
from
the
newspaper
as
from
the
law
he
managed
the
office
very
economically
and
by
having
the
work
done
by
girl
apprentices
with
the
help
of
one
boy
he
made
it
he
modelled
the
newspaper
upon
the
modern
conception
through
which
the
country
press
must
cease
to
have
any
influence
in
public
affairs
and
each
paper
become
little
more
than
an
open
letter
of
neighborhood
gossip
but
while
he
filled
his
sheet
with
minute
chronicles
of
the
goings
and
comings
of
unimportant
persons
and
with
all
attainable
particulars
of
the
ordinary
life
of
the
different
localities
he
continued
to
make
spicy
hits
at
the
enemies
of
equity
in
the
late
struggle
and
kept
the
public
spirit
of
the
town
alive
he
had
lately
undertaken
to
make
known
its
advantages
as
a
summer
resort
and
had
published
a
series
of
encomiums
upon
the
beauty
of
its
scenery
and
the
healthfulness
of
its
air
and
water
which
it
was
believed
would
put
it
in
a
position
of
rivalry
with
some
of
the
famous
white
mountain
places
he
invited
the
enterprise
of
outside
capital
and
advocated
a
road
up
the
valley
of
the
river
through
the
notch
so
as
to
develop
the
picturesque
advantages
of
that
region
in
all
this
the
color
of
mockery
let
the
wise
perceive
that
bartley
saw
the
joke
and
enjoyed
it
and
it
deepened
the
popular
impression
of
his
smartness
this
vein
of
cynicism
was
not
characteristic
as
it
would
have
been
in
an
older
man
it
might
have
been
part
of
that
spiritual
and
intellectual
unruliness
of
youth
which
people
laugh
at
and
forgive
and
which
one
generally
regards
in
after
life
as
something
almost
alien
to
one
self
he
wrote
long
bragging
articles
about
equity
in
a
tone
bordering
on
burlesque
and
he
had
a
department
in
his
paper
where
he
printed
humorous
squibs
of
his
own
and
of
other
people
these
were
sometimes
copied
and
in
the
daily
papers
of
the
state
he
had
been
mentioned
as
the
funny
man
of
the
equity
free
he
also
sent
letters
to
one
of
the
boston
journals
which
he
reproduced
in
his
own
sheet
and
which
gave
him
an
importance
that
the
best
endeavor
as
a
country
editor
would
never
have
won
him
with
the
villagers
he
would
naturally
as
the
local
printer
have
ranked
a
little
above
the
foreman
of
the
in
the
social
scale
and
decidedly
below
the
master
of
the
academy
but
his
personal
qualities
elevated
him
over
the
head
even
of
the
latter
but
above
all
the
fact
that
he
was
studying
law
was
a
guaranty
of
his
superiority
that
nothing
else
could
have
given
that
science
is
the
fountain
of
the
highest
distinction
in
a
country
town
bartley
whole
course
implied
that
he
was
above
editing
the
free
press
but
that
he
did
it
because
it
served
his
turn
that
was
admirable
he
sat
a
long
time
with
these
girls
letters
before
him
and
lost
himself
in
a
pensive
reverie
over
their
photographs
and
over
the
good
times
he
used
to
have
with
them
he
mused
in
that
formless
way
in
which
a
young
man
thinks
about
young
girls
his
soul
is
suffused
with
a
sense
of
their
sweetness
and
brightness
and
unless
he
is
distinctly
in
love
there
is
no
intention
in
his
thoughts
of
them
even
then
there
is
often
no
intention
bartley
might
very
well
have
a
good
conscience
about
them
he
had
broken
no
hearts
among
them
and
had
only
met
them
in
flirtation
what
he
really
regretted
as
he
held
their
letters
in
his
hand
was
that
he
had
never
got
up
a
correspondence
with
two
or
three
of
the
girls
whom
he
had
met
in
boston
though
he
had
been
cowed
by
their
magnificence
in
the
beginning
he
had
never
had
any
reverence
for
them
he
believed
that
they
would
have
liked
very
well
to
continue
his
acquaintance
but
he
had
not
known
how
to
open
a
correspondence
and
the
point
was
one
on
which
he
was
ashamed
to
consult
halleck
these
college
belles
compared
with
them
were
amusingly
inferior
by
a
natural
turn
of
thought
he
realized
that
they
were
inferior
to
marcia
gaylord
too
in
looks
and
style
no
less
than
in
an
impassioned
preference
for
himself
a
distaste
for
their
somewhat
veteran
ways
in
flirtation
grew
upon
him
as
he
thought
of
her
he
philosophized
against
them
to
her
advantage
he
could
not
blame
her
if
she
did
not
know
how
to
hide
her
feelings
for
him
yet
he
knew
that
marcia
would
rather
have
died
than
let
him
suppose
that
she
cared
for
him
if
she
had
known
that
she
was
doing
it
the
fun
of
it
was
that
she
should
not
know
this
charmed
him
it
touched
him
even
he
did
not
think
of
it
exultingly
as
the
night
before
but
sweetly
fondly
and
with
a
final
curiosity
to
see
her
again
and
enjoy
the
fact
in
her
presence
the
acrid
little
jets
of
smoke
which
escaped
from
the
joints
of
his
stove
from
time
to
time
annoyed
him
he
shut
his
portfolio
at
last
and
went
out
to
walk
iv
the
forenoon
sunshine
beating
strong
upon
the
thin
snow
along
the
edges
of
the
porch
floor
tattered
them
with
a
little
thaw
here
and
there
but
it
had
no
effect
upon
the
levels
of
the
street
up
the
middle
of
which
bartley
walked
in
a
silence
intensified
by
the
muffled
voices
of
exhortation
that
came
to
him
out
of
the
churches
it
was
in
the
very
heart
of
and
he
had
the
whole
street
to
himself
on
his
way
up
to
squire
gaylord
house
as
he
drew
near
he
saw
smoke
ascending
from
the
chimney
of
the
lawyer
office
a
little
white
building
that
stood
apart
from
the
dwelling
on
the
left
of
the
gate
and
he
knew
that
the
old
man
was
within
reading
there
with
his
hat
on
and
his
long
legs
flung
out
toward
the
stove
unshaven
and
unkempt
in
a
grim
protest
against
the
prevalent
christian
superstition
he
might
be
reading
hume
or
gibbon
or
he
might
be
reading
the
bible
a
book
in
which
he
was
deeply
versed
and
from
which
he
was
furnished
with
texts
for
the
demolition
of
its
friends
his
adversaries
he
professed
himself
a
great
admirer
of
its
literature
and
in
the
heat
of
controversy
he
often
found
himself
a
defender
of
its
doctrines
when
he
had
occasion
to
expose
the
fallacy
of
latitudinarian
interpretations
for
liberal
christianity
he
had
nothing
but
contempt
and
refuted
it
with
a
scorn
which
spared
none
of
the
worldly
tendencies
of
the
church
in
equity
the
idea
that
souls
were
to
be
saved
by
church
sociables
filled
him
with
inappeasable
rancor
and
he
maintained
the
superiority
of
the
old
puritanic
discipline
against
them
with
a
fervor
which
nothing
but
its
could
have
abated
it
was
said
that
squire
influence
had
largely
helped
to
keep
in
place
the
last
of
the
rigidly
orthodox
ministers
under
whom
his
liberalizing
congregation
chafed
for
years
of
discontent
but
this
was
probably
an
exaggeration
of
the
native
humor
gaylord
had
belonged
to
this
church
and
had
never
formally
withdrawn
from
it
and
the
lawyer
always
contributed
to
pay
the
salary
he
also
managed
a
little
property
for
him
so
well
as
to
make
him
independent
when
he
was
at
last
asked
to
resign
by
his
deacons
in
another
mood
bartley
might
have
stepped
aside
to
look
in
on
the
squire
before
asking
at
the
house
door
for
marcia
they
relished
each
company
as
people
of
contrary
opinions
and
of
no
opinions
are
apt
to
do
bartley
loved
to
hear
the
squire
get
going
as
he
said
and
the
old
man
felt
a
fascination
in
the
youngster
bartley
was
smart
he
took
a
point
as
quick
as
lightning
and
the
squire
did
not
mind
his
making
friends
with
the
mammon
of
righteousness
as
he
called
the
visible
church
in
equity
it
amused
him
to
see
bartley
lending
the
church
the
zealous
support
of
the
press
with
an
impartial
patronage
of
the
different
creeds
there
had
been
times
in
his
own
career
when
the
silence
of
his
opinions
would
have
greatly
advanced
him
but
he
had
not
chosen
to
pay
this
price
for
success
he
liked
his
freedom
or
he
liked
the
bitter
tang
of
his
own
tongue
too
well
and
he
had
remained
a
leading
lawyer
in
equity
when
he
might
have
ended
a
judge
or
even
a
congressman
of
late
years
however
since
people
whom
he
could
have
joined
in
their
agnosticism
so
heartily
up
to
a
certain
point
had
begun
to
make
such
fools
of
themselves
about
darwinism
and
the
brotherhood
of
all
men
in
the
monkey
he
had
grown
much
more
tolerant
he
still
clung
to
his
deistical
opinions
but
he
thought
no
worse
of
a
man
for
not
holding
them
he
did
not
deny
that
a
man
might
be
a
christian
and
still
be
a
very
good
man
the
audacious
humor
of
his
position
sufficed
with
a
people
who
liked
a
joke
rather
better
than
anything
else
in
his
old
age
his
infidelity
was
something
that
would
hardly
have
been
changed
if
possible
by
a
popular
vote
even
his
wife
to
whom
it
had
once
been
a
heavy
cross
borne
with
secret
prayer
and
tears
had
long
ceased
to
gainsay
it
in
any
wise
her
family
had
opposed
her
yoking
with
an
unbeliever
when
she
married
him
but
she
had
some
such
hopes
of
converting
him
as
women
cherish
who
give
themselves
to
men
confirmed
in
drunkenness
she
learned
as
other
women
do
that
she
could
hardly
change
her
husband
in
the
least
of
his
habits
and
that
in
this
great
matter
of
his
unbelief
her
love
was
powerless
it
became
easier
at
last
for
her
to
add
to
than
to
vex
him
with
her
anxieties
about
his
soul
and
to
act
upon
the
feeling
that
if
he
must
be
lost
then
she
did
not
care
to
be
saved
he
had
never
interfered
with
her
he
had
rather
promoted
it
for
he
liked
to
have
women
go
but
the
time
came
when
she
no
longer
cared
to
go
without
him
she
lapsed
from
her
membership
and
it
was
now
many
years
since
she
had
worshipped
with
the
people
of
her
faith
if
indeed
she
were
still
of
any
faith
her
life
was
silenced
in
every
way
and
as
often
happens
with
aging
wives
in
country
towns
she
seldom
went
out
of
her
own
door
and
never
appeared
at
the
social
or
public
solemnities
of
the
village
her
husband
and
her
daughter
composed
and
bounded
her
world
she
always
talked
of
them
or
of
other
things
as
related
to
them
she
had
grown
an
elderly
woman
without
losing
the
color
of
her
yellow
hair
and
the
bloom
of
girlhood
had
been
stayed
in
her
cheeks
as
if
by
the
young
habit
of
blushing
which
she
had
kept
she
was
still
what
her
neighbors
called
very
and
she
must
have
been
a
beautiful
girl
the
silence
of
her
inward
life
subdued
her
manner
till
now
she
seemed
always
to
have
come
from
some
place
on
which
a
deep
hush
had
newly
fallen
she
answered
the
door
when
bartley
turned
the
crank
that
snapped
the
in
its
centre
and
the
young
man
who
was
looking
at
the
street
while
waiting
for
some
one
to
come
confronted
her
with
a
start
oh
he
said
i
thought
it
was
marcia
good
morning
gaylord
is
marcia
at
home
she
went
to
church
this
morning
replied
her
mother
wo
you
walk
in
why
yes
i
guess
i
will
thank
you
faltered
bartley
in
the
irresolution
of
his
disappointment
i
hope
i
disturb
come
right
into
the
she
wo
be
gone
a
great
while
now
said
gaylord
leading
the
way
to
the
large
square
room
into
which
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
narrow
hall
opened
a
slumberous
heat
from
a
pervaded
the
place
and
a
clock
ticked
monotonously
on
a
shelf
in
the
corner
gaylord
said
wo
you
take
a
chair
and
herself
sank
into
the
rocker
with
a
deep
feather
cushion
in
the
seat
and
a
thinner
feather
cushion
tied
up
the
back
after
the
more
active
duties
of
her
housekeeping
were
done
she
sat
every
day
in
this
chair
with
her
knitting
or
sewing
and
let
the
clock
tick
the
long
hours
of
her
life
away
with
no
more
apparent
impatience
of
them
or
sense
of
their
dulness
than
the
cat
on
the
braided
rug
at
her
feet
or
the
geraniums
in
the
pots
at
the
sunny
window
are
you
pretty
well
she
asked
well
no
gaylord
i
not
answered
bartley
i
all
out
of
sorts
i
have
felt
so
dyspeptic
for
i
do
know
how
gaylord
smoothed
the
silk
dress
across
her
lap
the
thin
old
black
silk
which
she
still
instinctively
put
on
for
sabbath
observance
though
it
was
so
long
since
she
had
worn
it
to
church
mr
gaylord
used
to
have
it
when
we
were
first
married
though
he
aint
been
troubled
with
it
of
late
years
he
seemed
to
think
then
it
was
worse
i
do
believe
sunday
has
much
to
do
with
it
in
my
case
i
ate
some
and
some
toasted
cheese
last
night
and
i
guess
they
did
agree
with
me
very
well
said
bartley
who
did
not
spare
himself
the
confession
of
his
sins
when
seeking
sympathy
it
was
this
candor
that
went
so
far
to
convince
people
of
his
i
do
know
as
i
ever
heard
that
was
bad
said
gaylord
thoughtfully
mr
gaylord
used
to
eat
it
right
along
all
through
his
dyspepsia
and
he
never
complained
of
it
and
the
cheese
ought
to
have
made
it
well
i
do
know
what
it
was
replied
bartley
plaintively
submitting
to
be
exonerated
but
i
feel
perfectly
used
up
oh
i
suppose
i
shall
get
over
it
or
forget
all
about
it
by
he
added
with
strenuous
cheerfulness
it
is
anything
worth
gaylord
seemed
to
differ
with
him
on
this
point
head
ache
any
she
asked
it
did
this
morning
when
i
first
woke
up
bartley
assented
i
do
believe
but
what
a
cup
of
tea
would
be
the
best
thing
for
you
she
said
critically
bartley
had
instinctively
practised
a
social
art
which
ingratiated
him
with
people
at
equity
as
much
as
his
demands
for
sympathy
endeared
him
he
gave
trouble
in
little
unusual
ways
he
now
said
oh
i
wish
you
would
give
me
a
cup
why
yes
indeed
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
she
replied
she
went
to
the
kitchen
which
lay
beyond
another
room
and
reappeared
with
the
tea
directly
proud
of
her
promptness
but
having
it
on
her
conscience
to
explain
it
i
always
keep
the
pot
on
the
stove
hearth
sunday
morning
so
to
have
it
ready
if
gaylord
ever
wants
a
cup
he
a
master
hand
for
tea
and
always
was
there
guess
you
better
take
it
without
milk
i
put
some
sugar
in
the
saucer
if
you
want
she
dropped
noiselessly
upon
her
feather
cushion
again
and
bartley
who
had
risen
to
receive
the
tea
from
her
remained
standing
while
he
drank
it
that
does
seem
to
go
to
the
spot
he
said
as
he
sipped
it
thoughtfully
observant
of
its
effect
upon
his
disagreeable
feelings
i
wish
i
had
you
to
take
care
of
me
gaylord
and
keep
me
from
making
a
fool
of
myself
he
added
when
he
had
drained
the
cup
no
no
he
cried
at
her
offering
to
take
it
from
him
i
set
it
down
i
know
it
will
fret
you
to
have
it
in
here
and
i
carry
it
out
into
the
he
did
so
before
she
could
prevent
him
and
came
back
touching
his
mustache
with
his
handkerchief
i
declare
gaylord
i
should
love
to
live
in
a
kitchen
like
i
guess
you
would
if
you
had
to
said
gaylord
flattered
into
a
smile
marcia
she
likes
to
sit
out
there
she
says
better
than
anywheres
in
the
house
but
i
always
tell
her
it
because
she
was
there
so
much
when
she
was
little
i
do
see
as
she
seems
to
do
anything
there
sit
i
tell
her
not
but
what
she
knows
how
well
enough
gaylord
too
he
great
for
being
round
in
the
kitchen
if
he
gets
up
in
the
night
when
he
has
his
waking
spells
he
had
rather
take
his
lamp
out
there
if
there
a
fire
left
and
read
any
time
than
what
he
would
in
the
parlor
well
we
used
to
sit
there
together
a
good
deal
when
we
were
young
and
he
got
the
habit
of
it
there
everything
in
habit
she
added
thoughtfully
marcia
she
got
quite
in
the
way
lately
of
going
to
the
methodist
yes
i
seen
her
there
you
know
i
board
round
at
the
different
churches
as
the
schoolmaster
used
to
at
the
houses
in
the
old
mi
gaylord
looked
up
at
the
clock
and
gave
a
little
nervous
laugh
i
do
know
what
marcia
will
say
to
my
letting
her
company
stay
in
the
she
pretty
late
but
i
guess
you
wo
have
much
longer
to
wait
she
spoke
with
that
awe
of
her
daughter
and
her
judgments
which
is
one
of
the
pathetic
idiosyncrasies
of
a
certain
class
of
american
mothers
they
feel
themselves
to
be
not
so
well
educated
as
their
daughters
whose
fancied
knowledge
of
the
world
they
let
outweigh
their
own
experience
of
life
they
are
used
to
deferring
to
them
and
they
shrink
willingly
into
household
drudges
before
them
and
leave
them
to
order
the
social
affairs
of
the
family
gaylord
was
not
much
afraid
of
bartley
for
himself
but
as
marcia
company
he
made
her
more
and
more
uneasy
toward
the
end
of
the
quarter
of
an
hour
in
which
she
tried
to
entertain
him
with
her
simple
talk
varying
from
gaylord
to
marcia
and
from
marcia
to
gaylord
again
when
she
recognized
the
girl
quick
touch
in
the
closing
of
the
front
door
and
her
elastic
step
approached
through
the
hall
the
mother
made
a
little
deprecating
noise
in
her
throat
and
fidgeted
in
her
chair
as
soon
as
marcia
opened
the
door
gaylord
modestly
rose
and
went
out
into
the
kitchen
the
mother
who
remained
in
the
room
when
her
daughter
had
company
was
an
oddity
almost
unknown
in
equity
marcia
face
flashed
all
into
a
light
of
joy
at
sight
of
bartley
who
scarcely
waited
for
her
mother
to
be
gone
before
he
drew
her
toward
him
by
the
hand
she
had
given
she
mechanically
yielded
and
then
as
if
the
recollection
of
some
new
resolution
forced
itself
through
her
pleasure
at
sight
of
him
she
freed
her
hand
and
retreating
a
step
or
two
confronted
him
why
marcia
he
said
what
the
matter
nothing
she
answered
it
might
have
amused
bartley
if
he
had
felt
quite
well
to
see
the
girl
so
defiant
of
him
when
she
was
really
so
much
in
love
with
him
but
it
certainly
did
not
amuse
him
now
it
disappointed
him
in
his
expectation
of
finding
her
femininely
soft
and
comforting
and
he
did
not
know
just
what
to
do
he
stood
staring
at
her
in
discomfiture
while
she
gained
in
outward
composure
though
her
cheeks
were
of
the
jacqueminot
red
of
the
ribbon
at
her
throat
what
have
i
done
marcia
he
faltered
oh
you
have
done
some
one
has
been
talking
to
you
against
no
one
has
said
a
word
to
me
about
then
why
are
you
so
cold
so
strange
so
so
different
different
yes
from
what
you
were
last
night
he
answered
with
an
aggrieved
air
oh
we
see
some
things
differently
by
daylight
she
lightly
explained
wo
you
sit
down
no
thank
you
bartley
replied
sadly
but
unresentfully
i
think
i
had
better
be
going
i
see
there
is
something
wrong
i
do
see
why
you
say
there
is
anything
wrong
she
retorted
what
have
done
oh
you
have
not
anything
i
take
it
back
it
is
all
right
but
when
i
came
here
this
morning
encouraged
hoping
that
you
had
the
same
feeling
as
myself
and
you
seem
to
forget
everything
but
a
ceremonious
acquaintanceship
why
it
is
all
right
of
course
i
have
no
reason
to
complain
but
i
must
say
that
i
ca
help
being
he
saw
her
lips
quiver
and
her
bosom
heave
marcia
do
you
blame
me
for
feeling
hurt
at
your
coldness
when
i
came
here
to
tell
you
to
tell
you
i
i
love
you
with
his
nerves
all
unstrung
and
his
hunger
for
sympathy
he
really
believed
that
he
had
come
to
tell
her
this
yes
he
added
bitterly
i
tell
you
though
it
seems
to
be
the
last
word
i
shall
speak
to
you
i
go
bartley
you
shall
go
she
cried
throwing
herself
in
his
way
do
you
think
i
do
care
for
you
too
you
may
kiss
me
you
may
me
now
the
passionate
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
without
the
sound
of
sobs
or
the
contortion
of
weeping
and
she
did
not
wait
for
his
embrace
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
held
him
fast
crying
i
would
let
you
for
your
own
sake
darling
and
if
i
had
died
for
it
i
thought
i
should
die
last
night
i
was
never
going
to
let
you
kiss
me
again
till
you
said
till
till
now
do
you
see
she
caught
him
tighter
and
hid
her
face
in
his
neck
and
cried
and
laughed
for
joy
and
shame
while
he
suffered
her
caresses
with
a
certain
bewilderment
i
want
to
tell
you
now
i
want
to
explain
she
said
lifting
her
face
and
letting
him
from
her
as
far
as
her
arms
caught
around
his
neck
would
reach
and
fervidly
searching
his
eyes
lest
some
ray
of
what
he
would
think
should
escape
her
do
speak
a
word
first
father
saw
us
at
the
door
last
night
he
happened
to
be
coming
downstairs
because
he
could
sleep
just
when
you
oh
bartley
do
she
implored
at
the
little
smile
that
made
his
mustache
quiver
and
he
asked
me
whether
we
were
engaged
and
when
i
could
tell
him
we
were
i
know
what
he
thought
i
knew
how
he
despised
me
and
i
determined
that
if
you
did
tell
me
that
you
cared
for
me
and
that
the
reason
bartley
and
not
not
because
i
did
care
more
for
you
than
i
do
for
the
whole
world
and
and
you
do
mind
it
now
do
you
it
was
for
your
sake
whether
bartley
perfectly
divined
or
not
all
the
feeling
at
which
her
words
hinted
it
was
delicious
to
be
clung
about
by
such
a
pretty
girl
as
marcia
gaylord
to
have
her
now
darting
her
face
into
his
with
intolerable
consciousness
and
now
boldly
confronting
him
with
fondness
while
she
lightly
pushed
him
and
pulled
him
here
and
there
in
the
vehemence
of
her
appeal
perhaps
such
a
man
in
those
fastnesses
of
his
nature
which
psychology
has
not
yet
explored
never
loses
even
in
the
tenderest
transports
the
sense
of
prey
as
to
the
girl
whose
love
he
has
won
but
if
this
is
certain
it
is
also
certain
that
he
has
transports
which
are
tender
and
bartley
now
felt
his
soul
melted
with
affection
that
was
very
novel
and
sweet
why
marcia
he
said
what
a
strange
girl
you
are
he
sunk
into
his
chair
again
and
putting
his
arms
around
her
waist
drew
her
upon
his
knee
like
a
child
she
held
herself
apart
from
him
at
her
arm
length
and
said
wait
let
me
say
it
before
it
seems
as
if
we
had
always
been
engaged
and
everything
was
as
right
then
as
it
is
now
did
you
despise
me
for
letting
you
kiss
me
before
we
were
engaged
no
he
laughed
again
i
liked
you
for
but
if
you
thought
i
would
let
any
one
else
you
would
have
liked
it
this
diverted
him
still
more
i
should
have
liked
that
more
than
half
as
no
she
said
thoughtfully
she
dropped
her
face
awhile
on
his
shoulder
and
seemed
to
be
struggling
with
herself
then
she
lifted
it
and
did
you
ever
did
you
she
gasped
if
you
want
me
to
say
that
all
the
other
girls
in
the
world
are
not
worth
a
hair
of
your
head
i
say
that
marcia
now
let
talk
business
this
made
her
laugh
and
i
shall
want
a
little
lock
of
yours
she
said
as
if
they
had
hitherto
been
talking
of
nothing
but
each
other
hair
and
i
shall
want
all
of
yours
he
answered
no
do
be
she
critically
explored
his
face
how
funny
to
have
a
mole
in
your
eyebrow
she
put
her
finger
on
it
i
never
saw
it
you
never
looked
so
closely
there
a
scar
at
the
corner
of
your
upper
lip
that
i
had
can
you
see
that
she
demanded
radiantly
well
you
got
good
eyes
the
cat
did
it
when
i
was
a
little
the
door
opened
and
gaylord
surprised
them
in
the
celebration
of
these
discoveries
or
rather
she
surprised
herself
for
she
stood
holding
the
door
and
helpless
to
move
though
in
her
heart
she
had
an
apologetic
impulse
to
retire
and
she
even
believed
that
she
made
some
murmurs
of
excuse
for
her
intrusion
bartley
was
equally
abashed
but
marcia
rose
with
the
coolness
of
her
sex
in
the
intimate
emergencies
which
confound
a
man
oh
mother
it
you
i
forgot
about
you
come
in
or
set
the
table
if
that
what
you
as
gaylord
continued
to
look
from
her
to
bartley
in
her
daze
marcia
added
simply
we
engaged
mother
you
may
as
well
know
it
first
as
last
and
i
guess
you
better
know
it
her
mother
appeared
not
to
think
it
safe
to
relax
her
hold
upon
the
door
and
bartley
went
filially
to
her
rescue
if
it
was
rescue
to
salute
her
blushing
defencelessness
as
he
did
a
confused
sense
of
the
extraordinary
nature
and
possible
impropriety
of
the
proceeding
may
have
suggested
her
husband
to
her
mind
or
it
may
have
been
a
feeling
that
some
remark
was
expected
of
her
even
in
the
mental
destitution
to
which
she
was
reduced
have
you
told
gaylord
about
it
she
asked
of
either
or
neither
or
both
as
they
chose
to
take
it
bartley
left
the
word
to
marcia
who
answered
well
no
mother
we
have
yet
we
only
just
found
it
out
ourselves
i
guess
father
can
wait
till
he
comes
in
to
dinner
i
intend
to
keep
bartley
here
to
prove
he
said
remarked
gaylord
whom
bartley
had
led
to
her
chair
and
placed
on
her
cushion
he
had
a
headache
when
he
first
came
in
and
she
appealed
to
him
for
corroboration
while
she
vainly
endeavored
to
gather
force
to
grapple
again
with
the
larger
fact
that
he
and
marcia
were
just
engaged
to
be
married
marcia
stopped
down
and
pulled
her
mother
up
out
of
her
chair
with
a
hug
oh
come
now
mother
you
must
let
it
take
your
breath
away
she
said
with
patronizing
fondness
i
not
afraid
of
what
father
will
say
you
know
what
he
thinks
of
bartley
or
hubbard
as
i
presume
you
want
me
to
call
him
now
mother
you
just
run
up
stairs
and
put
on
your
best
cap
and
leave
me
to
set
the
table
and
get
up
the
dinner
i
guess
i
can
get
bartley
to
help
me
mother
mother
mother
she
cried
in
happiness
that
was
otherwise
unutterable
and
clasping
her
mother
closer
in
her
strong
young
arms
she
kissed
her
with
a
fervor
that
made
her
blush
again
before
the
young
man
marcia
marcia
you
had
ought
to
it
ridiculous
she
protested
but
she
suffered
herself
to
be
thrust
out
of
the
room
grateful
for
exile
in
which
she
could
collect
her
scattered
wits
and
set
herself
to
realize
the
fact
that
had
dispersed
them
it
was
decorous
also
for
her
to
leave
marcia
alone
with
hubbard
far
more
so
now
than
when
he
was
merely
company
she
felt
that
and
she
fumbled
over
the
dressing
she
was
sent
about
and
once
she
looked
out
of
her
chamber
window
at
the
office
where
gaylord
sat
and
wondered
what
gaylord
she
thought
of
him
and
even
dreamt
of
him
as
gaylord
and
had
never
in
the
most
familiar
moments
addressed
him
otherwise
say
but
she
left
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
him
and
marcia
she
was
used
to
leaving
them
to
the
settlement
of
their
own
difficulties
now
bartley
said
marcia
in
the
way
that
women
assume
in
such
matters
as
soon
as
the
great
fact
is
no
longer
in
doubt
you
must
help
me
to
set
the
table
put
up
that
leaf
and
i
put
up
this
i
going
to
do
more
for
mother
than
i
used
to
she
said
repentant
in
her
bliss
it
a
shame
how
much
i
left
to
the
domestic
instinct
was
already
astir
in
her
heart
bartley
pulled
the
straight
from
her
and
vied
with
her
in
the
rapidity
and
exactness
with
which
he
arranged
the
knives
and
forks
at
right
angles
beside
the
plates
when
it
came
to
some
heavier
dishes
they
agreed
to
carry
them
turn
about
but
when
it
was
her
turn
he
put
out
his
hand
to
support
her
elbow
as
i
did
last
night
and
saved
you
from
dropping
a
this
made
her
laugh
and
she
dropped
the
first
dish
with
a
crash
poor
mother
she
exclaimed
i
know
she
heard
that
and
she
be
in
agony
to
know
which
one
it
gaylord
did
indeed
hear
it
far
off
in
her
chamber
and
quaked
with
an
anxiety
which
became
intolerable
at
last
marcia
marcia
she
quavered
down
the
stairs
what
you
broken
marcia
opened
the
door
long
enough
to
call
back
oh
only
the
old
platter
mother
and
then
she
flew
at
bartley
crying
for
shame
for
shame
and
pressing
her
hand
over
his
mouth
to
stifle
his
laughter
she
hear
you
bartley
and
think
you
laughing
at
but
she
laughed
herself
at
his
struggles
and
ended
by
taking
him
by
the
hand
and
pulling
him
out
into
the
kitchen
where
neither
of
them
could
be
heard
she
abandoned
herself
to
the
ecstasy
of
her
soul
and
he
thought
she
had
never
been
so
charming
as
in
this
wild
gayety
why
marsh
i
never
saw
you
carry
on
so
before
you
never
saw
me
engaged
before
that
the
way
all
girls
act
if
they
get
the
chance
do
you
like
me
to
be
so
she
asked
with
quick
anxiety
rather
he
replied
oh
bartley
she
exclaimed
i
feel
like
a
child
i
surprise
myself
as
much
as
i
do
you
for
i
thought
i
had
got
very
old
and
i
did
suppose
i
should
ever
let
myself
go
in
this
way
but
there
is
something
about
this
that
lets
me
be
as
silly
as
i
like
it
somehow
as
if
i
were
a
great
deal
more
alone
when
i
with
you
than
when
i
by
myself
how
does
it
make
you
feel
good
he
answered
and
that
satisfied
her
better
than
if
he
had
entered
into
those
subtleties
which
she
had
tried
to
express
it
was
more
like
a
man
he
had
his
arm
about
her
again
and
she
put
down
her
hand
on
his
to
press
it
closer
against
her
heart
of
course
she
explained
recurring
to
his
surprise
at
her
frolic
mood
i
do
expect
you
to
be
silly
because
i
no
he
assented
but
how
can
i
help
it
oh
i
do
mean
for
the
time
being
i
mean
generally
speaking
i
mean
that
i
care
for
you
because
i
know
you
know
a
great
deal
more
than
i
do
and
because
i
respect
you
i
know
that
everybody
expects
you
to
be
something
great
and
i
do
bartley
did
not
deny
the
justness
of
her
opinions
concerning
himself
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
general
expectation
though
he
probably
could
not
see
the
relation
of
these
cold
abstractions
to
the
pleasure
of
sitting
there
with
a
pretty
girl
in
that
way
but
he
said
nothing
do
you
know
she
went
on
turning
her
face
prettily
around
toward
him
but
holding
it
a
little
way
off
to
secure
attention
as
impersonal
as
might
be
under
the
circumstances
what
pleased
me
more
than
anything
else
you
ever
said
to
me
no
answered
bartley
something
you
got
out
of
me
when
you
were
trying
to
make
me
tell
you
the
difference
between
you
and
the
other
equity
girls
she
laughed
in
glad
defiance
of
her
own
consciousness
well
i
trying
to
make
you
compliment
me
i
not
going
to
deny
it
but
i
must
say
i
got
my
you
did
say
a
thing
i
cared
for
but
you
did
afterward
do
you
remember
no
when
she
hesitated
a
moment
when
you
told
me
that
my
influence
had
had
made
you
better
you
know
oh
said
bartley
that
well
he
added
carelessly
it
every
word
true
did
you
believe
it
i
was
just
as
glad
as
if
i
did
and
it
made
me
resolve
never
to
do
or
say
a
thing
that
could
lower
your
opinion
of
me
and
then
you
know
there
at
the
door
it
all
seemed
part
of
our
trying
to
make
each
other
better
but
when
father
looked
at
me
in
that
way
and
asked
me
if
we
were
engaged
i
went
down
into
the
dust
with
shame
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
had
just
been
laughing
at
me
and
amusing
yourself
with
me
and
i
was
so
furious
i
did
know
what
to
do
do
you
know
what
i
wanted
to
do
i
wanted
to
run
downstairs
to
father
and
tell
him
what
you
had
said
and
ask
him
if
he
believed
you
had
ever
liked
any
other
she
paused
a
little
but
he
did
not
answer
and
she
continued
but
now
i
glad
i
did
and
i
shall
never
ask
you
that
and
i
shall
not
care
for
anything
that
you
happened
before
it
all
right
and
you
think
i
shall
always
to
make
you
good
and
happy
do
you
i
do
think
you
can
make
me
much
happier
than
i
am
at
present
and
i
do
believe
anybody
could
make
me
feel
better
answered
bartley
she
gave
a
little
laugh
at
his
refusal
to
be
serious
and
let
her
head
for
fondness
fall
upon
his
shoulder
while
he
turned
round
and
round
a
ring
he
found
on
her
finger
ah
ha
he
said
after
a
while
who
gave
you
this
ring
miss
gaylord
father
christmas
before
last
she
promptly
answered
without
moving
i
glad
you
asked
she
murmured
in
a
lower
voice
full
of
pride
in
the
maiden
love
she
could
give
him
there
never
been
any
one
but
you
or
the
thought
of
any
she
suddenly
started
away
now
let
play
we
getting
it
was
quite
time
in
the
next
moment
the
coffee
boiled
up
and
if
she
had
not
caught
the
lid
off
and
stirred
it
down
with
her
spoon
it
would
have
been
spoiled
the
steam
ascended
to
the
ceiling
and
filled
the
kitchen
with
the
fragrant
smell
of
the
berry
i
glad
we
going
to
have
coffee
she
said
you
have
to
put
up
with
a
cold
dinner
except
potatoes
but
the
coffee
will
make
up
and
i
shall
need
a
cup
to
keep
me
awake
i
do
believe
i
slept
last
night
till
nearly
morning
do
you
like
coffee
i
have
given
all
i
ever
expect
to
be
worth
for
a
cup
of
it
last
night
he
said
i
was
awfully
hungry
when
i
got
back
to
the
hotel
and
i
find
anything
but
a
piece
of
and
some
old
cheese
and
i
had
to
be
content
with
cold
milk
i
felt
as
if
i
had
lost
all
my
friends
this
morning
when
i
woke
a
sense
of
remembered
grievance
trembled
in
his
voice
and
made
her
drop
her
head
on
his
arm
in
pity
and
derision
of
him
poor
bartley
she
cried
and
you
came
up
here
for
a
little
petting
from
me
did
you
noticed
that
in
you
well
you
did
get
it
did
you
well
not
at
first
he
said
yes
you
ca
complain
of
any
want
of
petting
at
last
she
returned
delighted
at
his
indirect
recognition
of
the
difference
then
the
daring
the
archness
and
caprice
that
make
coquetry
in
some
women
and
lurk
a
divine
possibility
in
all
came
out
in
her
the
sweetness
kept
back
by
the
whole
strength
of
her
pride
overflowed
that
broken
barrier
now
and
she
seemed
to
lavish
this
revelation
of
herself
upon
him
with
a
sort
of
tender
joy
in
his
bewilderment
she
was
not
hurt
when
he
crudely
expressed
the
elusive
sense
which
has
been
in
other
men
minds
at
such
times
they
can
not
believe
that
this
fascination
is
inspired
and
not
practised
well
he
said
i
glad
you
told
me
that
i
was
the
first
i
should
have
thought
you
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
you
would
have
thought
so
if
you
had
been
a
great
flirt
yourself
she
answered
audaciously
perhaps
i
have
been
engaged
before
their
talk
was
for
the
most
part
frivolous
and
their
thoughts
ephemeral
but
again
they
were
with
her
at
least
suddenly
and
deeply
serious
till
then
all
things
seemed
to
have
been
held
in
arrest
and
impressions
ideas
feelings
fears
desires
released
themselves
simultaneously
and
sought
expression
with
a
rush
that
defied
coherence
oh
why
do
we
try
to
talk
she
asked
at
last
the
more
we
say
the
more
we
leave
unsaid
let
us
keep
still
awhile
but
she
could
not
bartley
when
did
you
first
think
you
cared
about
me
i
do
know
said
bartley
i
guess
it
must
have
been
the
first
time
i
saw
yes
that
is
when
i
first
knew
that
i
cared
for
you
but
it
seems
to
me
that
i
must
have
always
cared
for
you
and
that
i
only
found
it
out
when
i
saw
you
going
by
the
house
that
she
mused
a
little
time
before
she
asked
again
bartley
well
did
you
ever
use
to
be
afraid
or
no
wait
i
you
first
and
then
i
you
i
not
ashamed
of
it
now
though
once
i
thought
i
could
bear
to
have
any
one
find
it
out
i
used
to
be
awfully
afraid
you
did
care
for
me
i
would
try
to
make
out
from
things
you
did
and
said
whether
you
did
or
not
but
i
never
could
be
certain
i
believe
i
used
to
find
the
most
comfort
in
discouraging
myself
i
used
to
say
to
myself
of
course
he
does
how
can
he
he
been
everywhere
and
he
seen
so
many
girls
he
corresponds
with
lots
of
them
altogether
likely
engaged
to
some
of
the
young
ladies
he
met
in
boston
and
he
just
goes
with
me
here
for
a
blind
and
then
when
you
would
praise
me
sometimes
i
would
just
say
he
complimented
plenty
of
girls
i
know
thinking
this
instant
of
the
young
lady
he
engaged
to
in
boston
and
it
would
almost
kill
me
and
when
you
did
some
little
thing
to
show
that
you
liked
me
i
would
think
does
like
me
he
hates
he
despises
me
he
does
he
does
he
does
and
i
would
go
on
that
way
with
my
teeth
shut
and
my
breath
held
i
do
know
bartley
broke
out
into
a
broad
laugh
at
this
image
of
desperation
but
she
added
tenderly
i
hope
i
never
made
you
suffer
in
that
way
what
way
he
asked
that
what
i
wanted
you
to
tell
me
did
you
ever
did
you
use
to
be
afraid
sometimes
that
i
that
you
did
you
put
off
telling
me
that
you
cared
for
me
so
long
because
you
thought
you
dreaded
oh
i
do
see
what
i
can
ever
do
to
make
it
up
to
you
if
you
did
were
you
afraid
i
care
for
you
no
shouted
bartley
she
had
risen
and
stood
before
him
in
the
fervor
of
her
entreaty
and
he
seized
her
arms
pinioning
them
to
her
side
and
holding
her
helpless
while
he
laughed
and
laughed
again
i
knew
you
were
dead
in
love
with
me
from
the
first
bartley
bartley
hubbard
she
exclaimed
let
me
go
let
me
go
this
instant
i
never
heard
of
such
a
shameless
thing
but
she
really
made
no
effort
to
escape
the
house
seemed
too
little
for
marcia
happiness
and
after
dinner
she
did
not
let
bartley
forget
his
last
night
engagement
she
sent
him
off
to
get
his
horse
at
the
hotel
and
ran
up
to
her
room
to
put
on
her
wraps
for
the
drive
her
mother
cleared
away
the
dinner
things
she
pushed
the
table
to
the
side
of
the
room
and
then
sat
down
in
her
chair
and
waited
her
husband
pleasure
to
speak
he
ordinarily
rose
from
the
sunday
dinner
and
went
back
to
his
office
he
had
taken
a
chair
before
the
stove
but
he
had
mechanically
put
his
hat
on
and
he
wore
it
pushed
off
his
forehead
as
he
tilted
his
chair
back
on
its
hind
legs
and
braced
himself
against
the
hearth
of
the
stove
with
his
feet
a
man
is
master
in
his
own
house
generally
through
the
exercise
of
a
certain
degree
of
brutality
but
squire
gaylord
maintained
his
predominance
by
an
enlightened
absenteeism
no
man
living
always
at
home
was
ever
so
little
under
his
own
roof
while
he
was
in
more
active
business
life
he
had
kept
an
office
in
the
heart
of
the
village
where
he
spent
all
his
days
and
a
great
part
of
every
night
but
after
he
had
become
rich
enough
to
risk
whatever
loss
of
business
the
change
might
involve
he
bought
this
large
old
square
house
on
the
border
of
the
village
and
thenceforth
made
his
home
in
the
little
detached
office
if
gaylord
had
dimly
imagined
that
she
should
see
something
more
of
him
having
him
so
near
at
hand
she
really
saw
less
there
was
no
weather
by
day
or
night
in
which
he
could
not
go
to
his
office
now
he
went
no
more
than
his
wife
into
the
village
society
she
might
have
been
glad
now
and
then
of
a
little
glimpse
of
the
world
but
she
never
said
so
and
her
social
life
had
ceased
like
her
religious
life
their
house
was
richly
furnished
according
to
the
local
taste
of
the
time
the
parlor
had
a
brussels
carpet
and
heavy
chairs
of
mahogany
and
marcia
had
a
piano
there
and
since
she
had
come
home
from
school
they
had
made
company
as
gaylord
called
it
two
or
three
times
for
her
but
they
had
held
aloof
from
the
festivity
the
squire
in
his
office
and
gaylord
in
the
family
room
where
they
now
sat
in
unwonted
companionship
well
gaylord
said
his
wife
i
do
know
as
you
can
say
but
what
suited
well
this
was
the
first
allusion
they
had
made
to
the
subject
but
she
let
it
take
the
argumentative
form
of
her
cogitations
sighed
the
squire
in
long
nasal
assent
most
too
well
if
he
rasped
first
one
unshaven
cheek
and
then
the
other
with
his
thin
quivering
hand
he
smart
enough
said
gaylord
as
before
most
too
smart
replied
her
husband
a
little
more
quickly
than
before
he
smart
enough
even
if
she
was
to
see
from
the
start
that
she
was
crazy
to
have
him
and
that
is
the
best
way
to
begin
life
for
a
married
couple
if
i
a
it
would
killed
her
if
she
had
got
him
i
could
see
was
wearin
on
her
every
day
more
and
more
she
used
to
fairly
jump
every
knock
hear
at
the
door
and
i
know
sometimes
when
she
was
afraid
he
wa
coming
she
used
to
go
out
in
hopes
she
sh
meet
him
i
do
suppose
she
allowed
to
herself
that
she
did
it
for
that
marcia
said
the
squire
she
proud
and
when
a
proud
girl
makes
a
fool
of
herself
about
a
fellow
it
a
matter
of
life
and
death
with
her
she
ca
help
herself
she
lets
go
i
declare
gaylord
went
on
it
worked
me
up
considerable
to
have
her
come
in
some
those
times
and
see
by
her
face
she
seen
him
with
some
the
other
girls
she
used
to
so
and
then
i
hear
her
up
in
her
room
cryin
and
cryin
i
should
cared
so
much
if
marcia
been
like
any
other
girl
kind
of
flirty
like
about
it
but
she
wa
she
was
just
bowed
down
before
her
a
final
assent
came
from
the
squire
as
if
wrung
out
of
his
heart
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
then
sat
down
again
marcia
was
his
child
and
he
loved
her
with
his
whole
soul
he
deeply
sighed
all
that
over
anyway
but
he
tingled
in
an
anguish
of
sympathy
with
what
she
had
suffered
you
see
miranda
how
she
looked
at
me
when
she
first
came
in
with
him
so
proud
and
independent
poor
girl
and
yet
as
if
she
was
afraid
i
like
it
yes
i
see
he
pulled
his
hat
far
down
over
his
cavernous
eyes
and
worked
his
thin
rusty
old
jaws
i
hope
she
be
able
to
school
herself
so
t
not
show
out
her
feelings
so
much
said
gaylord
i
wish
she
could
school
herself
so
as
to
not
have
so
much
but
i
guess
she
have
and
i
guess
she
show
they
were
both
silent
after
a
while
he
added
throwing
at
the
stove
a
minute
fragment
of
the
cane
he
had
pulled
off
the
seat
of
his
chair
miranda
i
expected
something
of
this
sort
a
good
while
and
i
thought
over
what
bartley
had
better
gaylord
stooped
forward
and
picked
up
the
bit
of
wood
which
her
husband
had
thrown
down
her
vigilance
was
rewarded
by
finding
a
thread
on
the
near
where
it
lay
she
whipped
this
round
her
finger
and
her
husband
continued
he
better
give
up
his
paper
and
go
into
the
law
he
done
well
in
the
paper
and
he
a
smart
writer
but
editing
a
newspaper
aint
any
work
for
a
it
all
well
enough
as
long
as
he
single
but
when
he
got
a
wife
to
look
after
he
better
get
down
to
my
business
is
in
just
such
a
shape
now
that
i
could
hand
it
over
to
him
in
a
lump
but
come
to
wait
a
year
or
two
longer
and
this
young
man
and
that
one
eat
into
it
and
it
wo
be
the
same
thing
at
all
i
shall
want
bartley
to
push
right
along
and
get
admitted
at
once
he
can
do
it
fast
enough
he
bright
enough
added
the
old
man
with
a
certain
grimness
he
broke
out
with
a
quick
sigh
after
a
moment
of
musing
it
has
happened
at
any
very
bad
time
i
was
just
thinking
this
morning
that
i
should
like
to
have
my
whole
time
pretty
soon
to
look
after
my
property
i
want
bartley
to
do
for
me
i
give
him
a
good
start
in
money
and
in
business
but
i
look
after
my
property
myself
i
speak
to
him
the
first
chance
i
a
light
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
marcia
burst
into
the
room
ready
for
her
drive
i
wanted
to
get
a
good
warm
before
i
started
she
explained
stooping
before
the
stove
and
supporting
herself
with
one
hand
on
her
father
knee
there
had
been
no
formal
congratulations
upon
her
engagement
from
either
of
her
parents
but
this
was
not
requisite
and
would
have
been
a
little
affected
they
were
perhaps
now
ashamed
to
mention
it
outright
before
her
alone
the
squire
however
went
so
far
as
to
put
his
hand
over
the
hand
she
had
laid
upon
his
knee
and
to
smooth
it
twice
or
thrice
you
going
to
ride
after
that
sorrel
colt
of
bartley
he
asked
of
course
she
answered
with
playful
pertness
i
guess
bartley
can
manage
the
sorrel
colt
he
never
had
any
trouble
he
always
been
able
to
give
his
whole
mind
to
him
before
said
the
squire
he
gave
marcia
hand
a
significant
squeeze
and
let
it
go
she
would
not
confess
her
consciousness
of
his
meaning
at
once
she
looked
up
at
the
clock
and
then
turned
and
pulled
her
father
watch
out
of
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
compared
the
time
why
you
both
fast
perhaps
bartley
slow
said
the
squire
and
having
gone
as
far
as
he
intended
in
this
direction
he
permitted
himself
a
low
chuckle
the
jingled
without
and
she
sprang
lightly
to
her
feet
i
guess
you
do
think
bartley
slow
she
exclaimed
and
hung
over
her
father
long
enough
to
rub
her
lips
against
his
bristly
cheek
by
mother
she
said
over
her
shoulder
and
went
out
of
the
room
she
let
her
muff
hang
as
far
down
in
front
of
her
as
her
arms
would
reach
in
a
stylish
way
and
moved
with
a
little
rhythmical
tilt
as
if
to
some
inner
music
even
in
her
furs
she
was
elegantly
slender
in
shape
the
old
people
remained
silent
and
motionless
till
the
clash
of
the
bells
died
away
then
the
squire
rose
and
went
to
the
beyond
the
kitchen
whence
he
reappeared
with
an
armful
of
wood
his
wife
started
at
the
sight
mr
gaylord
what
you
doin
oh
i
going
to
make
up
a
little
fire
in
the
parlor
stove
i
guess
they
wo
want
us
round
a
great
deal
when
they
come
gaylord
said
well
i
never
did
when
her
husband
returned
from
the
parlor
she
added
i
suppose
some
folks
say
it
was
rather
of
a
strange
way
of
spendin
the
it
a
very
good
way
of
spending
the
sabbath
you
do
suppose
that
any
of
the
people
in
church
are
half
as
happy
do
you
why
old
jonathan
edwards
himself
used
to
allow
proper
opportunity
for
the
young
fellows
that
come
to
see
his
girls
a
room
and
fire
if
needed
his
says
i
guess
he
did
allow
it
on
the
sabbath
retorted
gaylord
well
the
do
say
chuckled
the
squire
why
miranda
i
do
it
for
marcia
there
never
but
one
first
day
to
an
engagement
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
in
saying
this
squire
gaylord
gave
way
to
his
repressed
emotion
in
an
extravagance
he
suddenly
stooped
over
and
kissed
his
wife
but
he
spared
her
confusion
by
going
out
to
his
office
at
once
where
he
stayed
the
whole
afternoon
bartley
and
marcia
took
the
long
drive
as
it
was
called
at
equity
the
road
plunged
into
the
darkly
wooded
gulch
beyond
the
house
and
then
struck
away
eastward
crossing
loop
after
loop
of
the
river
on
the
covered
bridges
where
the
neighbors
who
had
broken
it
out
with
their
in
the
open
had
thickly
bedded
it
in
snow
in
the
valleys
and
sheltered
spots
it
remained
free
and
so
wide
that
encountering
teams
could
easily
pass
each
other
but
where
it
climbed
a
hill
or
crossed
a
treeless
level
it
was
narrowed
to
a
single
track
with
at
established
points
where
the
drivers
of
the
sleighs
waited
to
be
sure
that
the
stretch
beyond
was
clear
before
going
forward
in
the
country
the
winter
which
held
the
village
in
such
close
siege
was
an
occupation
under
which
nature
seemed
to
cower
helpless
and
men
made
a
desperate
and
ineffectual
struggle
the
houses
banked
up
with
snow
almost
to
the
sills
of
the
windows
that
looked
out
blind
with
frost
upon
the
lifeless
world
were
dwarfed
in
the
drifts
and
seemed
to
founder
in
a
white
sea
blotched
with
strange
bluish
shadows
under
the
slanting
sun
where
they
fronted
close
upon
the
road
it
was
evident
that
the
fight
with
the
snow
was
kept
up
unrelentingly
spaces
were
shovelled
out
and
paths
were
kept
open
to
the
middle
of
the
highway
and
to
the
barn
but
where
they
were
somewhat
removed
there
was
no
visible
trace
of
the
conflict
and
no
sign
of
life
except
the
faint
wreathed
lines
of
smoke
wavering
upward
from
the
chimneys
in
the
hollows
through
which
the
road
passed
the
lower
boughs
of
the
pines
and
hemlocks
were
weighed
down
with
the
till
they
lay
half
submerged
in
the
drifts
but
wherever
the
wind
could
strike
them
they
swung
free
of
this
load
and
met
in
low
flat
arches
above
the
track
the
river
betrayed
itself
only
when
the
swift
current
of
a
ripple
broke
through
the
white
surface
in
long
irregular
grayish
blurs
it
was
all
wild
and
lonesome
but
to
the
girl
alone
in
it
with
her
lover
the
solitude
was
sweet
and
she
did
not
wish
to
speak
even
to
him
his
hands
were
both
busy
with
the
reins
but
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
she
might
lock
hers
through
his
arm
cowering
close
to
him
under
the
robes
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
out
over
the
flying
landscape
in
measureless
content
and
smiled
with
filling
eyes
when
he
bent
over
and
warmed
his
cold
red
cheek
on
the
top
of
her
fur
cap
the
moments
of
bliss
that
silence
a
woman
rouse
a
man
to
make
sure
of
his
rapture
how
do
you
like
it
marsh
he
asked
trying
at
one
of
these
times
to
peer
round
into
her
face
are
you
afraid
no
only
of
getting
back
too
he
made
the
shivering
echoes
answer
with
his
delight
in
this
and
chirruped
to
the
colt
who
pushed
forward
at
a
wilder
speed
flinging
his
hoofs
out
before
him
with
the
straight
thrust
of
the
horn
trotter
and
seeming
to
overtake
them
as
they
flew
i
should
like
this
ride
to
last
forever
forever
she
repeated
that
would
do
for
a
marsh
what
a
girl
you
are
i
never
supposed
you
would
be
so
free
to
let
a
fellow
know
how
much
you
cared
for
neither
did
i
she
answered
dreamily
but
now
now
the
only
trouble
is
that
i
do
know
to
let
him
she
gave
his
arm
to
which
she
clung
a
little
convulsive
clutch
and
pressed
her
head
harder
upon
his
shoulder
well
that
pretty
much
my
complaint
too
said
bartley
though
i
could
have
expressed
it
so
oh
express
she
murmured
with
the
pride
in
him
which
implied
that
there
were
no
thoughts
worth
expressing
to
which
he
could
not
give
a
monumental
utterance
her
adoration
flattered
his
to
the
same
passionate
intensity
and
to
something
like
the
generous
complexion
of
her
worship
marcia
he
answered
i
am
going
to
try
to
be
all
you
expect
of
me
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
do
anything
unworthy
of
your
she
could
only
press
his
arm
again
in
speechless
joy
but
she
said
to
herself
that
she
should
always
remember
these
words
the
wind
had
been
rising
ever
since
they
started
but
they
had
not
noticed
it
till
now
when
the
woods
began
to
thin
away
on
either
side
and
he
stopped
before
striking
out
over
one
of
the
naked
stretches
of
the
plain
a
white
waste
swept
by
the
blasts
that
sucked
down
through
a
gorge
of
the
mountain
and
flattened
the
as
the
tornado
flattens
the
waves
across
this
expanse
ran
the
road
its
stiff
lines
obliterated
here
and
there
in
the
slight
depressions
and
showing
dark
along
the
rest
of
the
track
it
was
a
good
to
the
next
body
of
woods
and
midway
there
was
one
of
those
sidings
where
a
sleigh
approaching
from
the
other
quarter
must
turn
out
and
yield
the
right
of
way
bartley
stopped
his
colt
and
scanned
the
road
anybody
coming
asked
marcia
no
i
do
see
any
one
but
if
there
any
one
in
the
woods
yonder
they
better
wait
till
i
get
across
no
horse
in
equity
can
beat
this
colt
to
the
oh
well
look
carefully
bartley
if
we
met
any
one
beyond
the
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
pleaded
the
girl
i
do
know
what
would
do
said
bartley
but
it
their
lookout
now
if
they
come
wrap
your
face
up
well
or
put
your
head
under
the
robe
i
got
to
hold
my
breath
the
next
he
loosed
the
reins
and
sped
the
colt
out
of
the
shelter
where
he
had
halted
the
wind
struck
them
like
an
edge
of
steel
and
catching
the
powdery
snow
that
their
hoofs
beat
up
sent
it
spinning
and
swirling
far
along
the
glistening
levels
on
their
lee
they
felt
the
thrill
of
the
go
as
if
they
were
in
some
light
boat
leaping
over
a
swift
current
marcia
disdained
to
cover
her
face
if
he
must
confront
the
wind
but
after
a
few
gasps
she
was
glad
to
bend
forward
and
bury
it
in
the
long
hair
of
the
bearskin
robe
when
she
lifted
it
they
were
already
past
the
siding
and
she
saw
a
cutter
dashing
toward
them
from
the
cover
of
the
woods
bartley
she
screamed
the
sleigh
yes
he
shouted
some
fool
there
going
to
be
trouble
here
he
added
checking
his
horse
as
he
could
they
do
seem
to
know
how
to
manage
it
a
couple
of
women
hold
on
hold
on
he
called
do
try
to
turn
out
i
turn
out
the
women
pulled
their
horse
head
this
way
and
that
in
apparent
confusion
and
then
began
to
turn
out
into
the
trackless
snow
at
the
roadside
in
spite
of
bartley
frantic
efforts
to
arrest
them
they
sank
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
drift
their
horse
plunged
and
struggled
and
then
their
cutter
went
over
amidst
their
shrieks
and
cries
for
help
bartley
drove
up
abreast
of
the
wreck
and
saying
still
jerry
do
be
afraid
marcia
he
put
the
reins
into
her
hands
and
sprang
out
to
the
rescue
one
of
the
women
had
been
flung
out
free
of
the
sleigh
and
had
already
gathered
herself
up
and
stood
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
oh
hubbard
hubbard
help
hannah
she
under
there
all
right
keep
quiet
morrison
take
hold
of
your
horse
head
bartley
had
first
of
all
seized
him
by
the
bit
and
pulled
him
to
his
feet
he
was
old
and
experienced
in
obedience
and
he
now
stood
waiting
orders
patiently
enough
bartley
seized
the
cutter
and
by
an
effort
of
all
his
strength
righted
it
the
colt
started
and
trembled
but
marcia
called
to
him
in
bartley
tone
still
jerry
and
he
obeyed
her
the
girl
who
had
been
caught
under
the
overturned
cutter
escaped
like
a
wild
thing
out
of
a
trap
when
it
was
lifted
and
plunging
some
paces
away
faced
round
upon
her
rescuer
with
the
hood
pulled
straight
and
set
comely
to
her
face
again
almost
before
he
could
ask
any
bones
broken
hannah
she
shouted
mother
mother
stop
crying
do
you
see
i
not
dead
she
leaped
about
catching
up
this
wrap
and
that
shaking
the
dry
snow
out
of
them
and
flinging
them
back
into
the
cutter
while
she
laughed
in
the
wild
tumult
of
her
spirits
bartley
helped
her
pick
up
the
fragments
of
the
wreck
and
joined
her
in
making
fun
of
the
adventure
the
wind
hustled
them
but
they
were
warm
in
defiance
of
it
with
their
jollity
and
their
bustle
why
did
you
let
me
turn
out
demanded
bartley
as
he
and
the
girl
stood
on
opposite
sides
of
the
cutter
rearranging
the
robes
in
it
oh
i
thought
i
could
turn
out
well
enough
you
had
a
right
to
the
well
the
next
time
you
see
any
one
past
the
you
better
not
start
from
the
why
there
no
more
room
in
the
woods
to
get
past
than
there
is
here
cried
the
girl
there
more
oh
i
not
cold
she
flashed
a
look
at
him
from
her
brilliant
face
warm
with
all
the
glow
of
her
young
health
and
laughed
and
before
she
dropped
her
eyes
she
included
marcia
in
her
glance
they
had
already
looked
at
each
other
without
any
sign
of
recognition
come
mother
all
right
now
her
mother
left
the
horse
head
and
heavily
ploughing
back
to
the
cutter
tumbled
herself
in
the
girl
from
her
side
began
to
climb
in
but
her
weight
made
the
sleigh
careen
and
she
dropped
down
with
a
gay
shriek
bartley
came
round
and
lifted
her
in
the
girl
called
to
her
horse
and
drove
up
into
the
road
and
away
bartley
looked
after
her
a
moment
and
continued
to
glance
in
that
direction
when
he
stood
stamping
the
snow
off
his
feet
and
brushing
it
from
his
legs
and
arms
before
he
remounted
to
marcia
side
he
was
excited
and
talked
rapidly
and
loudly
as
he
took
the
reins
from
passive
hold
and
let
the
colt
out
that
girl
is
the
pluckiest
fool
yet
would
let
me
turn
out
because
i
had
the
right
of
way
and
she
going
to
let
anybody
else
have
a
hand
in
getting
that
old
ark
of
theirs
afloat
again
good
their
horse
was
anything
like
jerry
how
well
jerry
behaved
were
you
frightened
marsh
he
bent
over
to
see
her
face
but
she
had
not
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
she
did
not
sit
close
to
him
now
did
you
freeze
oh
no
i
got
along
very
well
she
answered
dryly
and
edged
away
as
far
as
the
width
of
the
seat
would
permit
it
would
have
been
better
for
you
to
lead
their
horse
up
into
the
road
and
then
she
could
have
got
in
without
your
help
her
mother
got
in
he
took
the
reins
into
his
left
hand
and
passing
his
strong
right
around
her
pulled
her
up
to
his
side
she
resisted
with
diminishing
force
at
last
she
ceased
to
resist
and
her
head
fell
passively
to
its
former
place
on
his
shoulder
he
did
not
try
to
speak
any
word
of
comfort
he
only
held
her
close
to
him
when
she
looked
up
as
they
entered
the
village
she
confronted
him
with
a
brilliant
smile
that
ignored
her
tears
but
that
night
when
she
followed
him
to
the
door
she
looked
him
searchingly
in
the
eyes
i
wonder
if
you
really
do
despise
me
bartley
she
asked
certainly
he
answered
with
a
jesting
smile
what
for
for
showing
out
my
feelings
so
for
not
even
trying
to
pretend
not
to
care
everything
for
it
would
be
any
use
your
trying
i
should
know
that
you
did
oh
do
laugh
bartley
do
laugh
i
do
believe
that
i
ought
to
i
heard
that
it
makes
people
sick
of
you
but
i
ca
help
it
i
help
it
and
if
if
you
think
i
always
going
to
be
so
and
that
going
to
keep
on
getting
worse
and
worse
and
making
you
so
unhappy
why
you
better
break
your
engagement
now
while
you
have
a
what
have
you
been
making
me
unhappy
about
i
should
like
to
know
i
thought
i
been
having
a
very
good
she
hid
her
face
against
his
breast
it
almost
me
to
see
you
there
with
her
i
was
so
cold
my
hands
were
half
frozen
holding
the
reins
and
i
was
so
afraid
of
the
colt
i
did
know
what
to
do
and
i
had
been
keeping
up
my
courage
on
your
account
and
you
seemed
so
long
about
it
all
and
she
could
have
got
in
perfectly
well
as
well
as
her
mother
did
without
your
help
her
voice
broke
in
a
miserable
sob
and
she
clutched
herself
tighter
to
him
he
smoothed
down
her
hair
with
his
hand
why
marsh
did
you
think
that
made
me
unhappy
did
mind
it
a
bit
i
knew
what
the
trouble
was
at
the
time
but
i
was
going
to
say
anything
i
knew
you
would
be
all
right
as
soon
as
you
could
think
it
over
you
do
suppose
i
care
anything
for
that
girl
no
answered
a
rueful
sob
but
i
you
did
have
anything
to
do
with
her
i
know
she
make
trouble
for
you
well
said
bartley
i
ca
very
well
turn
her
off
as
long
as
she
does
her
work
but
you
need
be
worried
about
making
me
unhappy
if
anything
i
rather
liked
it
it
showed
how
much
you
care
for
he
bent
toward
her
with
a
look
of
bright
raillery
for
the
parting
kiss
now
then
once
twice
three
times
and
good
night
it
is
vi
the
spectacle
of
a
love
affair
in
which
the
woman
gives
more
of
her
heart
than
the
man
gives
of
his
is
so
pitiable
that
we
are
apt
to
attribute
a
kind
of
merit
to
her
as
if
it
were
a
voluntary
for
her
to
love
more
than
her
share
not
only
other
men
but
other
women
look
on
with
this
canonizing
compassion
for
women
have
a
lively
power
of
imagining
themselves
in
the
place
of
any
sister
who
suffers
in
matters
of
sentiment
and
are
eager
to
espouse
the
common
cause
in
commiserating
her
each
of
them
pictures
herself
similarly
wronged
or
slighted
by
the
man
she
likes
best
and
feels
how
cruel
it
would
be
if
he
were
to
care
less
for
her
than
she
for
him
and
for
the
time
being
in
order
to
realize
the
situation
she
loads
him
with
all
the
sins
of
omission
proper
to
the
culprit
in
the
alien
case
but
possibly
there
is
a
compensation
in
merely
loving
even
where
the
love
given
is
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
love
received
if
bartley
hubbard
sensations
and
impressions
of
the
day
had
been
at
all
reasoned
that
night
as
he
lay
thinking
it
over
he
could
unquestionably
have
seen
many
advantages
for
marcia
in
the
affair
perhaps
more
than
for
himself
but
to
do
him
justice
he
did
not
formulate
these
now
or
in
any
wise
explicitly
recognize
the
favors
he
was
bestowing
at
one
does
not
naturally
compute
them
in
musing
upon
the
girl
to
whom
one
is
just
betrothed
and
bartley
mind
was
a
confusion
of
pleasure
he
liked
so
well
to
think
how
fond
of
him
marcia
was
that
it
did
not
occur
to
him
then
to
question
whether
he
were
as
fond
of
her
it
is
possible
that
as
he
drowsed
at
last
there
floated
airily
through
the
consciousness
which
was
melting
and
dispersing
itself
before
the
approach
of
sleep
an
intimation
from
somewhere
to
some
one
that
perhaps
the
affair
need
not
be
considered
too
seriously
but
in
that
mysterious
limbo
one
can
not
be
sure
of
what
is
thought
and
what
is
dreamed
and
bartley
always
acquitted
himself
and
probably
with
justice
of
any
want
of
seriousness
what
he
did
make
sure
of
when
he
woke
was
that
he
was
still
out
of
sorts
and
that
he
had
again
that
dull
headache
and
his
instant
longing
for
sympathy
did
more
than
anything
else
to
convince
him
that
he
really
loved
marcia
and
had
never
in
his
obscurest
or
remotest
feeling
swerved
in
his
fealty
to
her
in
the
atmosphere
of
her
devotion
yesterday
he
had
so
wholly
forgotten
his
sufferings
that
he
had
imagined
himself
well
but
now
he
found
that
he
was
not
well
and
he
began
to
believe
that
he
was
going
to
have
what
the
country
people
call
a
fit
of
sickness
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
taken
care
of
that
he
was
unfit
to
work
and
in
his
vexation
at
not
being
able
to
go
to
marcia
for
really
amounted
to
nothing
less
he
entered
upon
the
day
affairs
with
fretful
impatience
the
free
press
was
published
on
tuesdays
and
monday
was
always
a
busy
time
of
preparation
the
hands
were
apt
also
to
feel
the
demoralization
that
follows
a
holiday
even
when
it
has
been
a
holy
day
the
girls
who
set
the
type
of
the
free
press
had
by
no
means
foregone
the
rights
and
privileges
of
their
sex
in
espousing
their
art
and
they
had
their
beaux
on
sunday
night
like
other
young
ladies
it
resulted
that
on
monday
morning
they
were
nervous
and
impatient
alternating
between
fits
of
giggling
delight
in
the
interchange
of
fond
reminiscences
and
the
crossness
which
is
pretty
sure
to
disfigure
human
behavior
from
want
of
sleep
but
ordinarily
bartley
got
on
very
well
with
them
in
spite
of
the
assumption
of
equality
between
all
classes
in
equity
they
stood
in
secret
awe
of
his
personal
splendor
and
the
tradition
of
his
achievements
at
college
and
in
the
great
world
and
a
flattering
joke
or
a
sharp
sarcasm
from
him
went
a
great
way
with
them
besides
he
had
an
efficient
lieutenant
in
henry
bird
the
young
printer
who
had
picked
up
his
trade
in
the
office
and
who
acted
as
foreman
so
far
as
the
establishment
had
an
organization
bird
had
industry
and
discipline
which
were
contagious
and
that
love
of
his
work
which
is
said
to
be
growing
rare
among
artisans
in
the
modern
subdivision
of
trades
this
boy
for
he
was
only
nineteen
worked
at
his
craft
early
and
late
out
of
pleasure
in
it
he
seemed
one
of
those
simple
subordinate
natures
which
are
happy
in
looking
up
to
whatever
assumes
to
be
above
them
he
exulted
to
serve
in
a
world
where
most
people
prefer
to
be
served
and
it
is
uncertain
whether
he
liked
his
work
better
for
its
own
sake
or
bartley
for
whom
he
did
it
he
was
slight
and
rather
delicate
in
health
and
it
came
natural
for
bartley
to
patronize
him
he
took
him
on
the
long
walks
of
which
he
was
fond
and
made
him
in
some
sort
his
humble
confidant
talking
to
him
of
himself
and
his
plans
with
large
and
braggart
vagueness
he
depended
upon
bird
in
a
great
many
things
and
bird
never
failed
him
for
he
had
a
basis
of
constancy
that
was
immovable
no
said
a
philosopher
from
a
neighboring
who
used
to
hang
about
the
a
long
time
after
he
had
got
his
paper
there
aint
a
great
deal
of
natural
git
up
and
howl
about
henry
but
he
stays
in
the
confidences
which
bartley
used
to
make
bird
he
promised
that
when
he
left
the
newspaper
for
the
law
he
would
see
that
no
one
else
succeeded
him
the
young
fellow
did
not
need
this
promise
to
make
him
bartley
fast
friend
but
it
colored
his
affection
with
ambitious
enthusiasm
to
edit
and
publish
a
newspaper
his
dreams
did
not
go
beyond
that
to
devote
it
to
bartley
interest
in
the
political
life
on
which
bartley
often
hinted
he
might
enter
that
would
be
the
sweetest
privilege
of
realized
success
bird
already
wrote
paragraphs
for
the
free
press
and
bartley
let
him
make
up
a
column
of
news
from
the
city
exchanges
which
was
partly
written
and
partly
selected
bartley
came
to
the
office
rather
late
on
monday
morning
bringing
with
him
the
papers
from
saturday
night
mail
which
had
lain
unopened
over
sunday
and
went
directly
into
his
own
room
without
looking
into
the
he
felt
feverish
and
irritable
and
he
resolved
to
fill
up
with
selections
and
let
his
editorial
paragraphing
go
or
get
bird
to
do
it
he
was
tired
of
the
work
and
sick
of
equity
marcia
face
seemed
to
look
sadly
in
upon
his
angry
discontent
and
he
no
longer
wished
to
go
to
her
for
sympathy
his
door
opened
and
without
glancing
from
the
newspaper
which
he
held
up
before
him
he
asked
what
is
it
bird
do
you
want
copy
well
no
hubbard
answered
bird
we
have
copy
enough
for
the
force
we
got
this
why
what
up
demanded
bartley
dropping
his
paper
lizzie
sawyer
has
sent
word
that
she
is
sick
and
we
have
heard
or
seen
anything
of
hannah
confound
the
girls
said
bartley
there
always
something
the
matter
with
he
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
as
if
to
rub
out
the
dull
pain
there
well
he
said
i
must
go
to
work
myself
he
rose
and
took
hold
of
the
lapels
of
his
coat
to
pull
it
off
but
something
in
bird
look
arrested
him
what
is
it
he
asked
old
morrison
was
here
just
before
you
came
in
and
said
he
wanted
to
see
you
i
think
he
was
drunk
said
bird
anxiously
he
said
he
was
coming
back
all
right
let
him
come
replied
bartley
this
is
a
free
country
especially
in
equity
i
suppose
he
wants
hannah
wages
raised
as
usual
how
much
are
we
behind
on
the
paper
henry
we
not
a
great
deal
behind
hubbard
if
we
were
not
so
perhaps
we
can
get
hannah
back
during
the
forenoon
at
any
rate
we
can
ask
her
honored
parent
when
he
where
morrison
got
his
liquor
was
a
question
that
agitated
equity
from
time
to
time
and
baffled
the
officer
of
the
law
empowered
to
see
that
no
strong
drink
came
into
the
town
under
conditions
which
made
it
impossible
even
in
the
and
rendered
the
sale
of
spirits
too
precarious
for
the
apothecary
who
might
be
supposed
to
deal
in
them
medicinally
morrison
never
failed
of
his
spree
when
the
mysterious
mechanism
of
his
appetite
enforced
it
probably
it
was
some
form
of
bedevilled
cider
that
supplied
the
material
of
his
debauch
but
even
cider
was
not
easily
to
be
had
morrison
spree
was
a
movable
feast
and
recurred
at
irregular
intervals
of
two
or
three
or
even
six
weeks
but
it
recurred
often
enough
to
keep
him
poor
and
his
family
in
a
social
outlawry
against
which
the
kindly
instincts
of
their
neighbors
struggled
in
vain
morrison
was
that
pariah
who
in
a
village
like
equity
cuts
herself
off
from
hope
by
taking
in
washing
and
it
was
a
decided
rise
in
the
world
for
hannah
a
wild
girl
at
school
to
get
a
place
in
the
her
father
had
applied
for
it
humbly
enough
at
the
tremulous
and
penitent
close
of
one
of
his
long
sprees
and
was
grateful
to
bartley
for
taking
the
special
interest
in
her
which
she
reported
at
home
but
the
independence
of
a
drunken
shoemaker
is
proverbial
and
meek
spirit
soared
into
lordly
arrogance
with
his
earliest
cups
the
first
warning
which
the
community
had
of
his
change
of
attitude
was
the
conspicuous
and
even
defiant
closure
of
his
shop
and
the
scornful
rejection
of
custom
however
urgent
or
necessitous
all
equity
might
go
in
broken
shoes
for
any
patching
or
the
people
got
from
him
he
went
about
collecting
his
small
dues
and
paying
up
his
debts
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
in
token
of
his
resolution
not
to
take
any
favors
from
any
man
thereafter
then
he
retired
to
his
house
on
one
of
the
by
streets
and
by
degrees
drank
himself
past
active
offence
it
was
of
course
in
his
defiant
humor
that
he
came
to
visit
bartley
who
had
learned
to
expect
him
whenever
hannah
failed
to
appear
promptly
at
her
work
the
affair
was
always
easily
arranged
bartley
instantly
assented
with
whatever
irony
he
liked
to
morrison
demands
he
refused
with
overwhelming
politeness
even
to
permit
him
to
give
himself
the
trouble
to
support
them
by
argument
he
complimented
hannah
inordinately
as
one
of
the
most
gifted
and
accomplished
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
and
inquired
affectionately
after
the
health
of
each
member
of
the
morrison
family
when
morrison
rose
to
go
he
always
said
in
shaking
hands
well
sir
if
there
was
more
like
you
in
equity
a
poor
man
could
get
along
you
a
gentleman
after
getting
some
paces
away
from
the
street
door
he
stumbled
back
up
the
stairs
to
repeat
you
a
gentleman
hannah
came
during
the
day
and
the
wages
remained
the
same
neither
of
the
contracting
parties
regarded
the
increase
so
elaborately
agreed
upon
and
morrison
on
becoming
sober
gratefully
ignored
the
whole
transaction
though
by
a
curious
juggle
of
his
brain
he
recurred
to
it
in
his
next
spree
and
advanced
in
his
new
demand
from
the
last
rise
his
daughter
was
now
nominally
in
receipt
of
an
income
of
forty
dollars
a
week
but
actually
accepted
four
bartley
on
his
part
enjoyed
the
business
as
an
agreeable
excitement
and
a
welcome
relief
from
the
monotony
of
his
official
life
he
never
hurried
morrison
visits
but
amused
himself
by
treating
him
with
the
most
flattering
distinction
and
baffling
his
arrogance
by
immediate
concession
but
this
morning
when
morrison
came
back
with
a
front
of
uncommon
fierceness
he
merely
looked
up
from
his
newspapers
to
which
he
had
recurred
and
said
coolly
oh
morrison
good
morning
i
suppose
that
little
advance
that
you
wish
to
see
me
about
take
a
chair
what
is
the
increase
you
ask
this
time
of
course
i
agree
to
he
leaned
forward
pencil
in
hand
to
make
a
note
of
the
figure
morrison
should
name
when
the
drunkard
approached
and
struck
the
table
in
front
of
him
with
his
fist
and
blazed
upon
bartley
face
suddenly
uplifted
with
his
blue
crazy
eyes
no
sir
i
wo
take
a
seat
and
i
do
come
on
no
such
business
no
sir
he
struck
the
table
again
and
the
violence
of
his
blow
upset
the
inkstand
bartley
saved
himself
by
suddenly
springing
away
hollo
here
he
shouted
what
do
you
mean
by
this
infernal
nonsense
what
do
mean
retorted
the
drunkard
by
makin
up
to
my
girl
you
a
fool
cried
bartley
and
drunk
i
show
you
whether
i
a
fool
and
i
show
you
whether
i
drunk
said
morrison
he
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
to
bird
with
an
air
of
mysterious
authority
young
man
come
here
bird
was
used
to
the
indulgence
with
which
bartley
treated
morrison
tipsy
freaks
and
supposed
that
he
had
been
called
by
his
consent
to
witness
another
agreement
to
a
rise
in
hannah
wages
he
came
quickly
to
help
get
morrison
out
of
the
way
the
sooner
and
he
was
astonished
to
be
met
by
bartley
with
i
do
want
you
all
right
answered
the
boy
and
he
turned
to
go
out
of
the
door
but
morrison
had
planted
himself
against
it
and
waved
bird
austerely
back
want
you
he
said
with
drunken
impressiveness
for
a
witness
wick
witness
while
i
ask
hubbard
what
he
means
by
hold
your
tongue
cried
bartley
get
out
of
this
he
advanced
a
pace
or
two
toward
morrison
who
stood
his
ground
without
swerving
now
you
you
keep
quiet
hubbard
said
morrison
with
a
swift
drunken
change
of
mood
by
which
he
passed
from
arrogant
denunciation
to
a
smooth
patronizing
mastery
of
the
situation
wish
this
thing
all
settled
amic
ic
bartley
broke
into
a
helpless
laugh
at
morrison
final
failure
on
a
word
difficult
to
sober
tongues
and
the
latter
went
on
no
for
bad
feeling
on
either
side
all
i
want
know
is
what
you
well
go
on
cried
bartley
and
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
which
he
tilted
back
and
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
looked
up
into
morrison
face
what
do
i
mean
by
what
probably
morrison
had
not
expected
to
be
categorical
or
to
bring
anything
like
a
bill
of
particulars
against
bartley
and
this
demand
gave
him
pause
what
you
mean
he
said
at
last
by
always
praising
her
up
so
what
i
said
she
a
very
good
girl
and
a
very
bright
one
you
do
deny
that
no
no
matter
what
i
deny
what
what
you
lend
her
all
them
books
for
to
improve
her
mind
you
do
object
to
that
i
thought
you
once
thanked
me
for
taking
an
interest
in
do
you
mind
what
i
object
to
and
what
i
thank
you
for
said
morrison
with
dignity
i
know
what
i
i
begin
to
doubt
but
get
on
i
in
a
great
hurry
this
morning
said
bartley
morrison
seemed
to
be
making
a
mental
examination
of
his
stock
of
charges
while
the
strain
of
keeping
his
upright
position
began
to
tell
upon
him
and
he
swayed
to
and
fro
against
the
door
what
that
word
you
sent
her
by
my
boy
night
that
she
was
a
smart
girl
and
would
be
sure
to
get
on
if
she
was
good
or
words
to
that
effect
i
trust
there
was
no
offence
in
that
morrison
morrison
surrendered
himself
to
another
season
of
cogitation
in
which
he
probably
found
his
vagueness
growing
upon
him
he
ended
by
fumbling
in
all
his
pockets
and
bringing
up
from
the
last
a
crumpled
scrap
of
paper
what
you
what
you
say
that
bartley
took
the
extended
scrap
with
an
easy
air
miss
handwriting
i
he
held
it
up
before
him
and
read
aloud
love
my
love
with
an
h
because
he
is
handsome
this
appears
to
be
a
confidence
of
miss
morrison
to
her
muse
whom
do
you
think
she
refers
to
morrison
what
what
the
first
letter
your
name
demanded
morrison
with
an
effort
to
collect
his
dispersing
severity
b
promptly
replied
bartley
perhaps
this
concerns
you
henry
your
name
begins
with
an
he
passed
the
paper
up
over
his
head
to
bird
who
took
it
silently
you
see
he
continued
addressing
bird
but
looking
at
morrison
as
he
spoke
mr
morrison
wishes
to
convict
me
of
an
attempt
upon
miss
hannah
affections
have
you
anything
else
to
urge
morrison
morrison
slid
at
last
from
his
difficult
position
into
a
convenient
chair
and
struggled
to
keep
himself
from
doubling
forward
i
want
know
what
you
mean
he
said
with
dogged
iteration
i
show
you
what
i
mean
said
bartley
with
an
ugly
quiet
while
his
mustache
began
to
twitch
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
seized
morrison
by
the
collar
pulling
him
up
out
of
the
chair
till
he
held
him
clear
of
the
floor
and
opened
the
door
with
his
other
hand
do
show
your
face
here
again
you
or
your
girl
either
still
holding
the
man
by
the
collar
he
pushed
him
before
him
through
the
office
and
gave
him
a
final
thust
out
of
the
outer
door
bartley
returned
to
his
room
in
a
white
heat
miserable
tipsy
rascal
he
panted
i
wonder
who
has
set
him
on
to
this
bird
stood
pale
and
silent
still
nolding
the
crumpled
scrap
of
paper
in
his
hand
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
impudent
little
witch
herself
had
put
him
up
to
it
she
capable
of
it
said
bartley
fumbling
aimlessly
about
on
his
table
in
his
wrath
without
looking
at
bird
it
a
lie
said
bird
bartley
started
as
if
the
other
had
struck
him
and
as
he
glared
at
bird
the
anger
went
out
of
his
face
for
pure
amazement
are
you
out
of
your
mind
henry
he
asked
calmly
perhaps
you
drunk
too
this
morning
the
devil
seems
to
have
got
into
pretty
much
it
a
lie
repeated
the
boy
while
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
as
good
a
girl
as
marcia
gaylord
is
any
day
better
go
away
henry
said
bartley
with
a
deadly
sort
of
gentleness
i
going
away
answered
the
boy
his
face
twisted
with
weeping
done
my
last
day
work
for
he
pulled
down
his
and
buttoned
them
at
the
wrists
while
the
tears
ran
out
over
his
face
helpless
tears
the
sign
of
his
womanish
tenderness
his
womanish
weakness
bartley
continued
to
glare
at
him
why
i
do
believe
you
in
love
with
her
yourself
you
little
fool
oh
i
a
fool
cried
bird
a
fool
to
think
as
much
of
you
as
i
always
have
a
fool
to
believe
that
you
were
a
gentleman
and
take
a
mean
advantage
i
was
a
fool
to
suppose
you
wanted
to
do
her
any
good
when
you
came
praising
and
flattering
her
and
turning
her
head
well
then
said
bartley
with
harsh
insolence
do
be
a
fool
any
longer
if
you
in
love
with
her
you
have
any
quarrel
with
me
my
boy
she
flies
at
higher
game
than
humble
newspaper
editors
the
head
of
willett
lumbering
gang
is
your
man
and
so
you
may
go
and
tell
that
old
sot
her
father
why
henry
you
do
mean
to
say
you
care
anything
for
that
girl
and
do
you
mean
to
say
you
have
done
everything
you
could
to
turn
her
head
since
she
been
in
this
office
she
used
to
like
me
well
enough
at
all
men
are
blind
and
jealous
children
alike
when
it
comes
to
question
of
a
woman
between
them
and
this
poor
boy
passion
was
turning
him
into
a
tiger
do
come
to
with
your
lies
any
more
here
his
rage
culminated
and
with
a
blind
cry
of
ay
he
struck
the
paper
which
he
had
kept
in
his
hand
into
bartley
face
the
demons
whatever
they
were
of
anger
remorse
pride
shame
were
at
work
in
bartley
heart
too
and
he
returned
the
blow
as
instantly
as
if
bird
touch
had
set
the
mechanism
of
his
arm
in
motion
in
contempt
of
the
other
weakness
he
struck
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
but
the
blow
was
enough
bird
fell
headlong
and
the
concussion
of
his
head
upon
the
floor
did
the
rest
he
lay
senseless
vii
bartley
hung
over
the
boy
with
such
a
terror
in
his
soul
as
he
had
never
had
before
he
believed
that
he
had
killed
him
and
in
this
conviction
came
with
the
simultaneity
of
events
in
dreams
the
sense
of
all
his
blame
of
which
the
blow
given
for
a
blow
seemed
the
least
part
he
was
not
so
wrong
in
that
as
he
was
wrong
in
what
led
to
it
he
did
not
abhor
in
himself
so
much
the
wretch
who
had
struck
his
brother
down
as
the
light
and
empty
fool
who
had
trifled
with
that
silly
hoyden
the
follies
that
seemed
so
amusing
and
resultless
in
their
time
had
ripened
to
this
bitter
effect
and
he
knew
that
he
and
not
she
was
mainly
culpable
her
however
it
came
about
was
proof
that
they
were
more
serious
with
her
than
with
him
and
he
could
not
plead
to
himself
even
the
poor
excuse
that
his
fancy
had
been
caught
amidst
the
anguish
of
his
the
need
to
conceal
what
he
had
done
occurred
to
him
he
had
been
holding
bird
head
in
his
arms
and
imploring
him
henry
henry
wake
up
in
a
low
husky
voice
but
now
he
turned
to
the
door
and
locked
it
and
the
lie
by
which
he
should
escape
sprang
to
his
tongue
he
died
in
a
he
almost
believed
it
as
it
murmured
itself
from
his
lips
there
was
no
mark
no
bruise
nothing
to
show
that
he
had
touched
the
boy
suddenly
he
felt
the
lie
choke
him
he
pulled
down
the
window
to
let
in
the
fresh
air
and
this
pure
breath
of
heaven
blew
into
his
darkened
spirit
and
lifted
there
a
little
the
vapors
which
were
thickening
in
it
the
horror
of
having
to
tell
that
lie
even
if
he
should
escape
by
it
all
his
life
long
till
he
was
a
gray
old
man
and
to
keep
the
truth
forever
from
his
lips
presented
itself
to
him
as
intolerable
slavery
oh
my
god
he
spoke
aloud
how
can
i
bear
that
and
it
was
in
that
he
revolted
from
it
few
men
love
the
truth
for
its
own
sake
and
bartley
was
not
one
of
these
but
he
practised
it
because
his
experience
had
been
that
lies
were
difficult
to
manage
and
that
they
were
a
burden
on
the
mind
he
was
not
candid
he
did
not
shun
concealments
and
evasions
but
positive
lies
he
had
kept
from
and
now
he
could
not
trust
one
to
save
his
life
he
unlocked
the
door
and
ran
out
to
find
help
he
must
do
that
at
last
he
must
do
it
at
any
risk
no
matter
what
he
said
afterward
when
our
deeds
and
motives
come
to
be
balanced
at
the
last
day
let
us
hope
that
mercy
and
not
justice
may
prevail
it
must
have
been
mercy
that
sent
the
doctor
at
that
moment
to
the
apothecary
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
enabled
bartley
to
get
him
up
into
his
office
without
publicity
or
explanation
other
than
that
henry
bird
seemed
to
be
in
a
fit
the
doctor
lifted
the
boy
head
and
explored
his
bosom
with
his
hand
is
he
is
he
dead
gasped
bartley
and
the
words
came
so
mechanically
from
his
tongue
that
he
began
to
believe
he
had
not
spoken
them
when
the
doctor
answered
no
how
did
this
happen
tell
me
we
had
a
quarrel
he
struck
me
i
knocked
him
bartley
delivered
up
the
truth
as
a
prisoner
of
war
or
a
captive
brigand
perhaps
parts
with
his
weapons
one
by
one
very
well
said
the
doctor
get
some
bartley
poured
some
out
of
the
pitcher
on
his
table
and
the
doctor
wetting
his
handkerchief
drew
it
again
and
again
over
bird
forehead
i
never
meant
to
hurt
him
said
bartley
i
did
even
intend
to
strike
him
when
he
hit
intentions
have
very
little
to
do
with
physical
effects
replied
the
doctor
sharply
henry
the
boy
opened
his
eyes
and
muttering
feebly
my
head
closed
them
again
there
a
concussion
here
said
the
doctor
we
had
better
get
him
home
drive
my
sleigh
over
will
you
from
bartley
went
out
into
the
glare
of
the
sun
which
beat
upon
him
like
the
eye
of
the
world
but
the
street
was
really
empty
as
it
often
was
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
at
equity
the
apothecary
who
saw
him
untying
the
doctor
horse
came
to
his
door
and
said
jocosely
hello
doc
sick
i
am
said
bartley
solemnly
and
the
apothecary
laughed
at
his
readiness
bartley
drove
round
to
the
back
of
the
where
the
farmers
delivered
his
wood
i
thought
we
could
get
him
out
better
that
way
he
explained
and
the
doctor
who
had
to
befriend
a
great
many
concealments
in
his
practice
silently
spared
bartley
disingenuousness
the
rush
of
the
cold
air
as
they
drove
rapidly
down
the
street
with
that
limp
shape
between
them
revived
the
boy
and
he
opened
his
eyes
and
made
an
effort
to
hold
himself
erect
but
he
could
not
and
when
they
got
him
into
the
warm
room
at
home
he
fainted
again
his
mother
had
met
them
at
the
door
of
her
poor
little
house
without
any
demonstration
of
grief
or
terror
she
was
far
too
well
acquainted
in
her
widowhood
bereft
of
all
her
children
but
this
son
with
sickness
and
death
to
show
even
surprise
if
she
felt
it
when
bartley
broke
out
into
his
lamentable
confession
oh
bird
this
is
work
she
only
wrung
her
hands
and
answered
work
oh
hubbard
he
thought
the
world
of
and
did
not
ask
him
how
or
why
he
had
done
it
after
they
had
got
henry
on
the
bed
bartley
was
no
longer
of
use
there
but
they
let
him
remain
in
the
corner
into
which
he
had
shrunk
and
from
which
he
watched
all
that
went
on
with
a
dry
mouth
and
faltering
breath
it
began
to
appear
to
him
that
he
was
very
young
to
be
involved
in
a
misfortune
like
this
he
did
not
understand
why
it
should
have
happened
to
him
but
he
promised
himself
that
if
henry
lived
he
would
try
to
be
a
better
man
in
every
way
after
he
had
lost
all
hope
the
time
seemed
so
long
the
boy
on
the
bed
opened
his
eyes
once
more
and
looked
round
while
bartley
still
sat
with
his
face
in
his
hands
where
where
is
hubbard
he
faintly
asked
with
a
bewildered
look
at
his
mother
and
the
doctor
bartley
heard
the
weak
voice
and
staggered
forward
and
fell
on
his
knees
beside
the
bed
here
here
here
i
am
henry
oh
henry
i
intend
he
stopped
at
the
word
and
hid
his
face
in
the
coverlet
the
boy
lay
as
if
trying
to
make
out
what
had
happened
and
the
doctor
told
him
that
he
had
fainted
after
a
time
he
put
out
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
bartley
head
yes
but
i
do
understand
what
makes
him
they
looked
at
bartley
who
had
lifted
his
head
and
he
went
over
the
whole
affair
except
so
far
as
it
related
to
hannah
morrison
he
did
not
spare
himself
he
had
often
found
that
strenuous
moved
others
to
compassion
and
besides
it
was
his
nature
to
seek
the
relief
of
full
confession
but
henry
heard
him
through
with
a
blank
countenance
you
remember
bartley
implored
at
last
no
i
do
remember
i
only
remember
that
there
seemed
to
be
something
the
matter
with
my
head
this
that
was
the
trouble
with
me
too
said
bartley
i
must
have
been
crazy
i
must
have
been
insane
when
i
struck
you
i
ca
account
for
i
do
remember
it
answered
the
boy
that
all
right
said
the
doctor
do
try
i
guess
you
better
let
him
alone
now
he
added
to
bartley
with
such
a
significant
look
that
the
young
man
retired
from
the
bedside
and
stood
awkwardly
apart
he
get
along
you
need
be
anxious
about
leaving
him
he
be
better
there
was
no
mistaking
this
hint
well
well
said
bartley
humbly
go
but
i
rather
stay
and
watch
with
him
i
eat
or
sleep
till
he
on
foot
again
and
i
ca
leave
till
you
tell
me
that
you
forgive
me
bird
i
never
dreamed
i
did
intend
he
could
not
go
on
i
do
suppose
you
meant
to
hurt
henry
said
the
mother
you
always
pretended
to
be
so
fond
of
him
and
he
thought
the
world
of
you
but
i
do
see
how
you
could
do
it
i
presume
it
was
all
no
it
was
all
wrong
or
so
nearly
all
wrong
that
i
must
ask
your
forgiveness
on
that
ground
i
loved
him
i
thought
the
world
of
him
too
i
ten
thousand
times
rather
have
hurt
myself
pleaded
bartley
let
me
go
till
you
say
that
you
forgive
i
see
how
henry
gets
along
said
bird
i
do
know
as
i
could
rightly
say
i
forgive
you
just
doubtless
she
was
dealing
conscientiously
with
herself
and
with
him
i
like
to
be
sure
of
a
thing
when
i
say
it
she
added
the
doctor
followed
him
into
the
hall
and
bartley
could
not
help
turning
to
him
for
consolation
i
think
bird
is
very
unjust
doctor
done
everything
i
could
and
said
everything
to
explain
the
matter
and
i
blamed
myself
where
i
ca
feel
that
i
was
to
blame
and
yet
you
see
how
she
holds
out
against
i
dare
say
answered
the
doctor
dryly
she
feel
differently
as
she
says
if
the
boy
gets
bartley
dropped
his
hat
to
the
floor
get
along
why
why
you
think
get
well
do
you
doctor
oh
yes
i
was
merely
using
her
words
he
get
and
and
it
wont
affect
his
mind
will
it
i
thought
it
was
very
strange
his
not
remembering
anything
about
it
that
a
very
common
phenomenon
said
the
doctor
the
patient
usually
forgets
everything
that
occurred
for
some
little
time
before
the
accident
in
cases
of
concussion
of
the
bartley
shuddered
at
the
phrase
but
he
could
not
ask
anything
further
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
you
continued
the
doctor
was
that
this
may
be
a
long
thing
and
there
may
have
to
be
an
inquiry
into
it
you
lawyer
enough
to
understand
what
that
means
i
should
have
to
testify
to
what
i
know
and
i
only
know
what
you
told
why
you
do
doubt
no
sir
i
no
reason
to
suppose
you
have
told
me
the
truth
as
far
as
it
goes
if
you
have
thought
it
advisable
to
keep
anything
back
from
me
you
may
wish
to
tell
the
whole
story
to
an
i
have
kept
anything
back
doctor
wills
said
bartley
i
told
you
everything
everything
that
concerned
the
quarrel
that
drunken
old
scoundrel
of
a
morrison
got
us
into
it
he
accused
me
of
making
love
to
his
daughter
and
henry
was
jealous
i
never
knew
he
cared
anything
for
her
i
hated
to
tell
you
this
before
his
mother
but
this
is
the
whole
truth
so
help
me
i
supposed
it
was
something
of
the
kind
replied
the
doctor
i
sorry
for
you
you
ca
keep
it
from
having
an
ugly
look
if
it
gets
out
and
it
may
have
to
be
made
public
i
advise
you
to
go
and
see
squire
gaylord
always
stood
your
i
i
was
just
going
there
said
bartley
and
this
was
true
through
all
he
had
felt
the
need
of
some
sort
of
retrieval
of
himself
in
his
own
esteem
by
some
signal
stroke
and
he
could
think
of
but
one
thing
it
was
not
his
fault
if
he
believed
that
this
must
combine
with
safety
and
the
greatest
degree
of
humiliation
with
the
largest
sum
of
consolation
he
was
none
the
less
resolved
not
to
spare
himself
at
all
in
offering
to
release
marcia
from
her
engagement
the
fact
that
he
must
now
also
see
her
father
upon
the
legal
aspect
of
his
case
certainly
complicated
the
affair
and
detracted
from
its
heroic
quality
he
could
not
tell
which
to
see
first
for
he
naturally
wished
his
action
to
look
as
well
as
possible
and
if
he
went
first
to
marcia
and
she
condemned
him
he
did
not
know
in
what
figure
he
should
approach
her
father
if
on
the
other
hand
he
went
first
to
squire
gaylord
the
old
lawyer
might
insist
that
the
engagement
was
already
at
an
end
by
bartley
violent
act
and
might
well
refuse
to
let
a
man
in
his
position
even
see
his
daughter
he
lagged
up
the
middle
of
the
street
and
left
the
question
to
solve
itself
at
the
last
moment
but
when
he
reached
squire
gaylord
gate
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
would
be
easier
to
face
the
father
first
and
this
would
be
the
right
way
too
he
turned
aside
to
the
little
office
and
opened
the
door
without
knocking
and
as
he
stood
with
the
knob
in
his
hand
trying
to
habituate
his
eyes
full
of
the
to
the
dimmer
light
within
he
heard
a
rapturous
cry
of
why
bartley
and
he
felt
marcia
arms
flung
around
his
neck
his
burdened
heart
yearned
upon
her
with
a
tenderness
he
had
not
known
before
he
realized
the
preciousness
of
an
embrace
that
might
be
the
last
but
he
dared
not
put
down
his
lips
to
hers
she
pushed
back
her
head
in
a
little
wonder
and
saw
the
haggardness
of
his
face
while
he
discovered
her
father
looking
at
them
how
strong
and
pure
the
fire
in
her
must
be
when
her
father
presence
could
not
abash
her
from
this
betrayal
of
her
love
bartley
sickened
and
he
felt
her
arms
slip
from
his
neck
why
why
what
is
the
matter
in
spite
of
some
vaguely
magnanimous
intention
to
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
the
whole
affair
just
as
it
happened
bartley
found
himself
wishing
to
put
the
best
face
on
it
at
first
and
trust
to
chances
to
make
it
all
appear
well
he
did
not
speak
at
once
and
marcia
pressed
him
into
a
chair
and
then
like
an
eager
child
who
will
not
let
its
friend
escape
till
it
has
been
told
what
it
wishes
to
know
she
set
herself
on
his
knee
and
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
looked
at
her
father
not
at
her
while
he
spoke
hoarsely
i
have
had
trouble
with
henry
bird
squire
gaylord
and
i
come
to
tell
you
about
the
old
squire
did
not
speak
but
marcia
repeated
in
amazement
with
henry
bird
he
struck
me
henry
bird
you
cried
the
girl
i
should
like
to
know
why
henry
bird
struck
when
you
made
so
much
of
him
and
he
always
pretended
to
be
so
grateful
bartley
still
looked
at
her
father
and
i
struck
him
you
did
perfectly
right
bartley
exclaimed
marcia
and
i
should
have
despised
you
if
you
had
let
any
one
run
over
you
struck
you
i
declare
he
did
not
heed
her
but
continued
to
look
at
her
father
i
did
intend
to
hurt
him
i
hit
him
with
my
open
hand
but
he
fell
and
struck
his
head
on
the
floor
i
afraid
it
hurt
him
pretty
he
felt
the
pang
that
thrilled
through
the
girl
at
his
words
and
her
hand
trembled
on
his
shoulder
but
she
did
not
take
it
away
the
old
man
came
forward
from
the
pile
of
books
which
he
and
marcia
had
been
dusting
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
on
the
other
side
of
the
stove
he
pushed
back
his
hat
from
his
forehead
and
asked
drily
what
commenced
it
bartley
hesitated
it
was
this
part
of
the
affair
which
he
would
rather
have
imparted
to
marcia
after
seeing
it
with
her
father
eyes
or
possibly
if
her
father
viewed
it
favorably
have
had
him
tell
her
the
old
man
noticed
his
reluctance
had
you
better
go
into
the
house
marsh
she
merely
gave
him
a
look
of
utter
astonishment
for
answer
and
did
not
move
he
laughed
noiselessly
and
said
to
bartley
go
it
was
that
drunken
old
scoundrel
of
a
morrison
who
began
it
cried
bartley
in
angry
desperation
marcia
dropped
her
hand
from
his
shoulder
while
her
father
worked
his
jaws
upon
the
bit
of
stick
he
had
picked
up
from
the
pile
of
wood
and
put
between
his
teeth
you
know
that
whenever
he
gets
on
a
spree
he
comes
to
the
office
and
wants
hannah
wages
marcia
sprang
to
her
feet
oh
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
i
told
you
she
would
get
you
into
trouble
i
told
you
so
she
stood
clinching
her
hands
and
her
father
bent
his
keen
scrutiny
first
upon
her
and
then
upon
the
frowning
face
with
which
bartley
regarded
her
did
he
come
to
have
her
wages
raised
what
did
he
come
for
he
involuntarily
assumed
the
attitude
of
a
lawyer
crossquestioning
a
slippery
witness
he
came
for
he
came
he
accused
me
of
he
said
i
had
made
love
to
his
confounded
marcia
gasped
what
made
him
think
you
had
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
have
any
reason
he
was
drunk
i
had
been
kind
to
the
girl
and
favored
her
all
i
could
because
she
seemed
to
be
anxious
to
do
her
work
well
and
i
praised
her
for
commented
the
squire
and
that
made
henry
bird
jealous
it
seems
that
he
was
fond
of
her
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
and
when
i
put
old
morrison
out
of
the
office
and
came
back
he
called
me
a
liar
and
struck
me
in
the
he
did
not
lift
his
eyes
to
the
level
of
marcia
who
in
her
gray
dress
stood
there
like
a
gray
shadow
and
did
not
stir
or
speak
and
you
never
had
made
up
to
the
girl
at
all
kissed
her
i
suppose
now
and
then
suggested
the
squire
bartley
did
not
reply
flattered
her
up
and
told
how
much
you
thought
of
her
occasionally
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
said
bartley
with
a
sulky
defiance
no
i
suppose
it
what
you
do
with
most
any
pretty
girl
returned
the
squire
he
was
silent
awhile
and
so
you
knocked
henry
down
what
happened
then
i
tried
to
bring
him
to
and
then
i
went
for
the
doctor
he
revived
and
we
got
him
home
to
his
mother
the
doctor
says
he
will
get
well
but
he
advised
me
to
come
and
see
any
witnesses
of
the
assault
no
we
were
alone
in
my
own
told
any
one
else
about
it
i
told
the
doctor
and
bird
henry
could
remember
it
at
could
remember
about
morrison
or
what
made
him
mad
at
you
and
that
all
about
it
the
two
men
had
talked
across
the
stove
at
each
other
practically
ignoring
the
girl
who
stood
apart
from
them
gray
in
the
face
as
her
dress
and
suppressing
a
passion
which
had
turned
her
as
rigid
as
stone
now
marcia
said
her
father
kindly
better
go
into
the
house
all
there
is
of
no
that
is
all
she
answered
give
me
my
ring
bartley
she
slipped
it
off
her
finger
and
put
it
into
his
mechanically
extended
hand
marcia
he
implored
confronting
her
give
me
my
ring
he
obeyed
and
put
it
into
her
hand
she
slipped
it
back
on
the
finger
from
which
she
had
so
fondly
suffered
him
to
take
it
yesterday
and
replace
it
with
his
own
i
go
into
the
house
now
father
good
by
her
eyes
were
perfectly
clear
and
dry
and
her
voice
controlled
and
as
he
stood
passive
before
her
she
took
him
round
the
neck
and
pressed
against
his
face
once
and
twice
and
thrice
her
own
gray
face
in
which
all
love
and
unrelenting
and
despair
were
painted
once
and
again
she
held
him
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
as
if
to
be
sure
it
was
he
then
with
a
last
pressure
of
her
face
to
his
she
released
him
and
passed
out
of
the
door
she
been
talking
about
you
here
all
the
morning
said
the
squire
with
a
sort
of
quiet
absence
as
if
nothing
in
particular
had
happened
and
he
were
commenting
on
a
little
fact
that
might
possibly
interest
bartley
he
ruminated
upon
the
fragment
of
wood
in
his
mouth
awhile
before
he
added
i
guess
she
wo
want
to
talk
about
you
any
more
i
drew
you
out
a
little
on
that
hannah
morrison
business
because
i
wanted
her
to
understand
just
what
kind
of
fellow
you
were
you
see
it
is
the
trouble
you
got
into
with
henry
bird
that
killed
her
it
the
cause
of
the
trouble
i
guess
if
it
had
been
anything
else
she
have
stood
by
you
but
you
see
the
one
thing
she
could
bear
and
i
glad
it
happened
now
instead
of
afterwards
i
guess
you
one
of
that
squire
gaylord
cried
bartley
upon
my
sacred
word
of
honor
there
any
more
of
this
thing
than
i
told
you
and
i
think
it
pretty
hard
to
be
thrown
over
for
for
fooling
with
a
pretty
girl
when
you
get
a
chance
and
the
girl
seems
to
like
it
yes
it
rather
hard
and
i
suppose
you
have
even
seen
her
since
you
were
engaged
to
marcia
of
course
not
that
is
it
a
kind
of
retroactive
legislation
on
marcia
part
said
the
squire
rubbing
his
chin
and
that
against
one
of
the
first
principles
of
law
but
women
do
seem
to
be
able
to
grasp
that
idea
they
queer
about
some
things
they
appear
to
think
they
marry
a
man
whole
life
his
past
as
well
as
his
future
and
that
makes
particular
and
they
distinguish
between
different
kinds
of
men
you
find
pinning
their
faith
to
a
fellow
who
been
through
pretty
much
everything
and
swearing
by
him
from
the
word
go
and
another
chap
who
never
anything
very
bad
they
wo
trust
half
a
minute
out
of
their
sight
well
i
guess
marcia
of
rather
a
jealous
disposition
he
concluded
as
if
bartley
had
urged
this
point
she
very
unjust
to
me
bartley
began
oh
yes
she
said
her
father
i
do
deny
that
but
it
would
be
any
use
talking
to
her
she
probably
turn
round
with
some
excuse
about
what
she
had
suffered
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
she
would
say
that
she
could
go
through
it
again
well
it
ought
to
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
think
you
do
care
a
great
deal
about
but
i
care
exclaimed
bartley
i
care
all
the
world
for
it
i
since
when
interrupted
the
squire
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
know
till
you
asked
her
yesterday
that
marcia
was
in
love
with
you
bartley
was
silent
i
guess
you
knew
it
as
much
as
a
year
ago
did
you
everybody
else
did
but
you
just
as
soon
it
had
been
hannah
morrison
or
any
other
pretty
girl
did
care
but
marcia
did
you
see
she
was
one
of
the
kind
that
let
any
fellow
make
love
to
them
it
was
because
it
was
and
you
knew
it
we
plain
men
hubbard
and
i
guess
you
get
over
this
in
time
i
should
wonder
if
you
began
to
mend
right
bartley
found
himself
helpless
in
the
face
of
this
passionless
sarcasm
he
could
have
met
stormy
indignation
or
any
sort
of
invective
in
kind
but
the
contemptuous
irony
with
which
his
pretensions
were
treated
the
cold
scrutiny
with
which
his
motives
were
searched
was
something
he
could
not
meet
he
tried
to
pull
himself
together
for
some
sort
of
protest
but
he
ended
by
hanging
his
head
in
silence
he
always
believed
that
squire
gaylord
had
liked
him
and
here
he
was
treating
him
like
his
bitterest
enemy
and
seeming
to
enjoy
his
misery
he
could
not
understand
it
he
thought
it
extremely
unjust
and
past
all
the
measure
of
his
offence
this
was
true
perhaps
but
it
is
doubtful
if
bartley
would
have
accepted
any
suffering
no
matter
how
nicely
proportioned
in
punishment
of
his
he
sat
hanging
his
head
and
taking
his
pain
in
rebellious
silence
with
a
gathering
hate
in
his
heart
for
the
old
man
said
the
squire
at
last
rising
from
his
chair
i
guess
i
must
be
bartley
sprang
to
his
feet
aghast
you
not
going
to
leave
me
in
the
lurch
are
you
you
not
oh
i
shall
take
care
of
you
young
man
do
be
afraid
i
stood
your
friend
too
long
and
your
name
been
mixed
up
too
much
with
my
girl
for
me
to
let
you
come
to
shame
openly
if
i
can
help
it
i
going
to
see
wills
about
you
and
i
going
to
see
bird
and
try
to
patch
it
up
and
and
where
shall
i
go
gasped
bartley
you
might
go
to
the
devil
for
all
i
cared
for
you
said
the
old
man
with
the
contempt
which
he
no
longer
cared
to
make
ironical
but
i
guess
you
better
go
back
to
your
office
and
go
to
work
as
if
nothing
had
happened
till
something
does
happen
i
shall
close
the
paper
out
as
soon
as
i
can
i
was
thinking
of
doing
that
just
before
you
came
in
i
was
thinking
of
taking
you
into
the
law
business
with
me
marcia
and
i
were
talking
about
it
here
but
i
guess
you
would
like
the
idea
he
seemed
to
get
a
bitter
satisfaction
out
of
these
mockeries
from
which
indeed
he
must
have
suffered
quite
as
much
as
bartley
but
he
ended
sadly
and
almost
compassionately
with
come
come
you
must
start
some
and
bartley
dragged
his
leaden
weight
out
of
the
door
the
squire
closed
it
after
him
but
he
did
not
accompany
him
down
the
street
it
was
plain
that
he
did
not
wish
to
be
any
longer
alone
with
bartley
and
the
young
man
suspected
with
a
sting
of
shame
that
he
scorned
to
be
seen
with
him
viii
the
more
bartley
dwelt
upon
his
hard
case
during
the
week
that
followed
the
more
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
was
punished
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
offence
he
was
in
no
mood
to
consider
such
mercies
as
that
he
had
been
spared
from
seriously
hurting
bird
and
that
squire
gaylord
and
doctor
wills
had
united
with
henry
mother
in
saving
him
from
open
disgrace
the
physician
indeed
had
perhaps
indulged
a
professional
passion
for
hushing
the
matter
up
rather
than
any
pity
for
bartley
he
probably
had
the
scientific
way
of
looking
at
such
questions
and
saw
much
physical
cause
for
moral
effects
he
refrained
with
the
physician
reticence
from
inquiring
into
the
affair
but
he
would
not
have
thought
bartley
without
excuse
under
the
circumstances
in
regard
to
the
relative
culpability
in
matters
of
the
kind
his
knowledge
of
women
enabled
him
to
take
much
the
view
of
the
woman
share
that
other
women
take
but
bartley
was
ignorant
of
the
doctor
leniency
and
associated
him
with
squire
gaylord
in
the
feeling
that
made
his
last
week
in
equity
a
period
of
social
outlawry
there
were
moments
in
which
he
could
not
himself
escape
the
same
point
of
view
he
could
rebel
against
the
severity
of
the
condemnation
he
had
fallen
under
in
the
eyes
of
marcia
and
her
father
he
could
in
the
light
of
example
and
usage
laugh
at
the
notion
of
harm
in
his
behavior
to
hannah
morrison
yet
he
found
himself
looking
at
it
as
a
treachery
to
marcia
certainly
she
had
no
right
to
question
his
conduct
before
his
engagement
yet
if
he
knew
that
marcia
loved
him
and
was
waiting
with
anxiety
for
some
word
of
love
from
him
it
was
cruelly
false
to
play
with
another
at
the
passion
which
was
such
a
tragedy
to
her
this
was
the
point
that
put
aside
however
often
still
presented
itself
and
its
recurrence
if
he
could
have
known
it
was
mercy
and
reprieve
from
the
only
source
out
of
which
these
could
come
hannah
morrison
did
not
return
to
the
and
bird
was
still
sick
though
it
was
now
only
a
question
of
time
when
he
should
be
out
again
bartley
visited
him
some
hours
every
day
and
sat
and
suffered
under
the
quiet
condemnation
of
his
mother
eyes
she
had
kept
bartley
secret
with
the
same
hardness
with
which
she
had
refused
him
her
forgiveness
and
the
village
had
settled
down
into
an
ostensible
acceptance
of
the
theory
of
a
faint
as
the
beginning
of
bird
sickness
with
such
other
conjectures
as
the
doctor
freely
permitted
each
to
form
bartley
found
his
chief
consolation
in
the
work
which
kept
him
out
of
the
way
of
a
great
deal
of
question
he
worked
far
into
the
night
as
he
must
to
make
up
for
the
force
that
was
withdrawn
from
the
office
at
the
same
time
he
wrote
more
than
ever
in
the
paper
and
he
discovered
in
himself
that
dual
life
of
which
every
one
who
sins
or
sorrows
is
sooner
or
later
aware
that
strange
separation
of
the
intellectual
activity
from
the
suffering
of
the
soul
by
which
the
mind
toils
on
in
a
sort
of
ironical
indifference
to
the
pangs
that
wring
the
heart
the
realization
that
in
some
ways
his
brain
can
get
on
perfectly
well
without
his
conscience
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
felt
for
bartley
at
this
time
and
his
popularity
in
equity
was
never
greater
than
now
when
his
life
there
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
spectacle
of
his
diligence
was
so
impressive
that
when
on
the
following
sunday
the
young
minister
who
had
succeeded
to
the
pulpit
of
the
orthodox
church
preached
a
sermon
on
the
beauty
of
industry
from
the
text
consider
the
lilies
there
were
many
who
said
that
they
thought
of
bartley
the
whole
while
and
one
a
lady
asked
savin
if
he
did
not
have
hubbard
in
mind
in
the
picture
he
drew
of
the
heroic
worker
they
wished
that
bartley
could
have
heard
that
sermon
marcia
had
gone
away
early
in
the
week
to
visit
in
the
town
where
she
used
to
go
to
school
and
bartley
took
her
going
away
as
a
sign
that
she
wished
to
put
herself
wholly
beyond
his
reach
or
any
danger
of
relenting
at
sight
of
him
he
talked
with
no
one
about
her
and
going
and
coming
irregularly
to
his
meals
and
keeping
himself
shut
up
in
his
room
when
he
was
not
at
work
he
left
people
very
little
chance
to
talk
with
him
but
they
conjectured
that
he
and
marcia
had
an
understanding
and
some
of
the
ladies
used
such
scant
opportunity
as
he
gave
them
to
make
sly
allusions
to
her
absence
and
his
desolate
condition
they
were
confirmed
in
their
surmise
by
the
fact
known
from
actual
observation
that
bartley
had
not
spoken
a
word
to
any
other
young
lady
since
marcia
went
away
look
here
my
friend
said
the
philosopher
from
the
when
he
came
in
for
his
paper
on
the
tuesday
afternoon
following
seems
to
me
from
what
i
hear
tell
around
here
you
tryin
to
kill
yourself
on
this
newspaper
now
it
wo
do
i
tell
you
it
wo
bartley
was
addressing
for
the
mail
the
papers
which
one
of
the
girls
was
folding
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
he
demanded
of
his
sympathizer
with
whimsical
sullenness
not
troubling
himself
to
look
up
at
him
well
i
haint
exactly
settled
yet
replied
the
philosopher
who
was
of
a
tall
lank
figure
and
of
a
mighty
brown
beard
but
i
been
around
pretty
much
everywhere
and
i
find
that
about
the
poorest
use
you
can
put
a
man
to
is
to
kill
it
depends
a
good
deal
on
the
man
said
bartley
but
that
stale
kinney
it
the
old
formula
of
the
fellows
try
something
else
they
not
talking
of
hanging
me
he
kept
on
writing
and
the
philosopher
stood
over
him
with
a
humorous
twinkle
of
enjoyment
at
bartley
readiness
well
i
allow
it
old
he
admitted
so
yes
but
you
do
pretend
that
you
wrote
kinney
laughed
mightily
then
he
leaned
forward
and
slapped
bartley
on
the
shoulder
with
his
newspaper
look
here
he
exclaimed
i
you
oh
try
some
other
tack
lots
of
fellows
like
bartley
kept
on
writing
i
gave
you
your
paper
did
i
kinney
you
mean
that
you
want
me
to
get
out
far
be
it
from
me
to
say
this
delighted
kinney
as
much
as
the
last
refinement
of
hospitality
would
have
pleased
another
man
look
here
he
said
i
want
you
should
come
out
and
see
our
camp
i
ca
fool
away
any
more
time
on
you
here
but
i
want
you
should
come
out
and
see
us
give
you
something
to
write
about
hey
the
invitation
comes
at
a
time
when
circumstances
over
which
i
have
no
control
oblige
me
to
decline
it
i
admire
your
prudence
no
honest
injian
now
protested
kinney
take
a
day
off
and
fill
up
with
dead
advertisements
that
the
way
they
used
to
do
out
in
alkali
city
when
they
got
short
of
help
on
the
eagle
and
we
liked
it
just
as
now
you
are
talking

said
bartley
looking
up
at
him
how
far
is
it
to
your
settlement
two
miles
if

three
and
a
half

kinney

added
laying
his
hand
on
shoulder

i

replied
bartley
just
mention
good
said
kinney
it
is
bartley
finished
addressing
the
newspapers
and
then
he
put
them
up
in
wrappers
and
packages
for
the
mail
you
can
go
now
marilla
he
said
to
the
girl
i
leave
some
copy
for
you
and
kitty
you
find
it
on
my
table
in
the
all
right
answered
the
girl
bartley
went
to
his
supper
which
he
ate
with
more
relish
than
he
had
felt
for
his
meals
since
his
troubles
began
and
he
took
part
in
the
talk
with
something
of
his
old
audacity
the
change
interested
the
lady
boarders
and
they
agreed
that
he
must
have
had
a
letter
he
returned
to
his
office
and
worked
till
nine
writing
and
selecting
matter
out
of
his
exchanges
he
spent
most
of
the
time
in
preparing
the
funny
column
which
was
a
favorite
feature
in
the
free
press
then
he
put
the
copy
where
the
girls
would
find
it
in
the
morning
and
leaving
the
door
unlocked
took
his
way
up
the
street
toward
squire
gaylord
he
knew
that
he
should
find
the
lawyer
in
his
office
and
he
opened
the
office
door
without
knocking
and
went
in
he
had
not
met
squire
gaylord
since
the
morning
of
his
dismissal
and
the
old
man
had
left
him
for
the
past
eight
days
without
any
sign
as
to
what
he
expected
of
bartley
or
of
what
he
intended
to
do
in
his
affair
they
looked
at
each
other
but
exchanged
no
sort
of
greeting
as
bartley
unbidden
took
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stove
the
squire
did
not
put
down
the
book
he
had
been
reading
i
come
to
see
what
you
going
to
do
about
the
free
press
said
bartley
the
old
man
rubbed
his
bristling
jaw
that
seemed
even
lanker
than
when
bartley
saw
it
last
he
waited
almost
a
minute
before
he
replied
i
know
as
i
got
any
call
to
tell
then
i
tell
you
what
going
to
do
about
it
retorted
bartley
i
going
to
leave
it
i
done
my
last
day
work
on
that
paper
do
you
think
he
cried
angrily
that
i
going
to
keep
on
in
the
dark
and
let
you
consult
your
pleasure
as
to
my
future
no
sir
you
do
know
your
man
quite
gaylord
you
got
over
your
scare
said
the
lawyer
i
got
over
my
scare
bartley
retorted
and
you
think
because
you
not
afraid
any
longer
that
you
out
of
danger
i
know
my
man
as
well
as
you
do
i
if
you
think
i
care
for
the
danger
i
do
you
may
do
what
you
please
whatever
you
do
i
shall
know
it
is
out
of
kindness
for
me
i
believe
from
the
first
that
the
law
could
touch
me
and
i
was
uneasy
on
that
account
but
i
did
want
to
involve
myself
in
a
public
scandal
for
miss
gaylord
sake
miss
gaylord
has
released
me
from
any
obligations
to
her
and
now
you
may
go
ahead
and
do
what
you
each
of
the
men
knew
how
much
truth
there
was
in
this
but
for
the
moment
in
his
anger
bartley
believed
himself
sincere
and
there
is
no
question
but
his
defiance
was
so
squire
gaylord
made
him
no
answer
and
after
a
minute
of
expectation
bartley
added
at
any
rate
i
done
with
the
free
press
i
advise
you
to
stop
the
paper
and
hand
the
office
over
to
henry
bird
when
he
gets
about
i
going
out
to
willett
tomorrow
and
i
coming
back
to
equity
on
saturday
you
know
where
to
find
me
till
then
and
after
that
you
may
look
me
up
if
you
want
he
rose
to
go
but
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
at
a
sound
preliminary
to
speaking
which
the
old
man
made
in
his
throat
bartley
stopped
hoping
for
a
further
pretext
of
quarrel
but
the
lawyer
merely
asked
where
the
key
it
in
the
office
the
old
man
now
looked
at
him
as
if
he
no
longer
saw
him
and
bartley
went
out
balked
of
his
purpose
in
part
and
in
that
degree
so
much
the
more
embittered
squire
gaylord
remained
an
hour
longer
then
he
blew
out
his
lamp
and
left
the
little
office
for
the
night
a
light
was
burning
in
the
kitchen
and
he
made
his
way
round
to
the
back
door
of
the
house
and
let
himself
in
his
wife
was
there
sitting
before
the
stove
in
those
last
delicious
moments
before
going
to
bed
when
all
the
house
is
mellowed
to
such
a
warmth
that
it
seems
hard
to
leave
it
to
the
cold
and
dark
in
this
poor
lady
who
had
so
long
denied
herself
spiritual
comfort
there
was
a
certain
obscure
luxury
she
liked
little
dainties
of
the
table
she
liked
soft
warmth
an
easy
cushion
it
was
doubtless
in
the
disintegration
of
the
finer
qualities
of
her
nature
that
as
they
grew
older
together
she
threw
more
and
more
the
burden
of
acute
feeling
upon
her
husband
to
whose
doctrine
of
life
she
had
submitted
but
had
never
been
reconciled
marriage
is
with
all
its
disparities
a
much
more
equal
thing
than
appears
and
the
meek
little
wife
who
has
all
the
advantage
of
public
sympathy
knows
her
power
over
her
oppressor
and
at
some
tender
spot
in
his
affections
or
his
nerves
can
inflict
an
anguish
that
will
avenge
her
for
years
of
coarser
aggression
thrown
in
upon
herself
in
so
vital
a
matter
as
her
religion
gaylord
had
involuntarily
come
to
live
largely
for
herself
though
her
talk
was
always
of
her
husband
she
gave
up
for
him
as
she
believed
her
salvation
but
she
held
him
to
account
for
the
uttermost
farthing
of
the
price
she
padded
herself
round
at
every
point
where
she
could
have
suffered
through
her
sensibilities
and
lived
soft
and
snug
in
the
shelter
of
his
iron
will
and
indomitable
courage
it
was
not
apathy
that
she
had
felt
when
their
children
died
one
after
another
but
an
obscure
and
formless
exultation
that
gaylord
would
suffer
enough
for
both
marcia
was
the
youngest
and
her
mother
left
her
training
almost
wholly
to
her
father
she
sometimes
said
that
she
never
supposed
the
child
would
live
she
did
not
actually
urge
this
in
excuse
but
she
had
the
appearance
of
doing
so
and
she
held
aloof
from
them
both
in
their
mutual
relations
with
mildly
critical
reserves
they
spoiled
each
other
as
father
and
daughter
are
apt
to
do
when
left
to
themselves
what
was
good
in
the
child
certainly
received
no
harm
from
his
indulgence
and
what
was
naughty
was
after
all
not
so
very
naughty
she
was
passionate
but
she
was
generous
and
if
she
showed
a
jealous
temperament
that
must
hereafter
make
her
unhappy
for
the
time
being
it
charmed
and
flattered
her
father
to
have
her
so
fond
of
him
that
she
could
not
endure
any
rivalry
in
his
affection
her
education
proceeded
fitfully
he
would
not
let
her
be
forced
to
household
tasks
that
she
disliked
and
as
a
little
girl
she
went
to
school
chiefly
because
she
liked
to
go
and
not
because
she
would
have
been
obliged
to
it
if
she
had
not
chosen
when
she
grew
older
she
wished
to
go
away
to
school
and
her
father
allowed
her
he
had
no
great
respect
for
but
if
marcia
wanted
to
try
it
he
was
willing
to
humor
the
joke
what
resulted
was
a
great
proficiency
in
the
things
that
pleased
her
and
ignorance
of
the
other
things
her
father
bought
her
a
piano
on
which
she
did
not
play
much
and
he
bought
her
whatever
dresses
she
fancied
he
never
came
home
from
a
journey
without
bringing
her
something
and
he
liked
to
take
her
with
him
when
he
went
away
to
other
places
she
had
been
several
times
at
portland
and
once
at
montreal
he
was
very
proud
of
her
he
could
not
see
that
any
one
was
or
dressed
any
better
than
his
girl
he
came
into
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
with
his
hat
on
and
taking
his
chin
between
his
fingers
moved
uneasily
about
on
his
chair
what
brought
you
in
so
early
asked
his
wife
well
i
got
through
he
briefly
explained
after
a
while
he
said
bartley
hubbard
been
out
you
do
mean
he
knew
she
no
he
did
know
anything
about
that
he
came
to
tell
me
he
was
going
well
i
do
know
what
you
going
to
do
gaylord
said
his
wife
shifting
the
responsibility
wholly
upon
him
he
seem
to
want
to
make
it
up
said
the
squire
he
was
on
his
high
horse
he
knows
he
aint
in
any
danger
aint
you
afraid
she
carry
on
dreadfully
when
she
finds
out
gone
for
good
asked
gaylord
with
a
sort
of
implied
satisfaction
that
the
carrying
on
was
not
to
affect
her
said
the
squire
i
suppose
she
carry
on
but
i
do
know
what
to
do
about
it
sometimes
i
almost
wish
i
tried
to
make
it
up
between
that
day
but
i
thought
she
better
see
once
for
all
what
sort
of
man
she
was
going
in
for
if
she
married
him
it
too
late
now
to
do
anything
the
fellow
came
in
for
a
quarrel
and
nothing
else
i
could
see
that
and
i
did
give
him
any
you
feel
sure
asked
gaylord
impartially
that
marcia
too
particular
no
miranda
i
do
feel
sure
of
anything
except
that
it
past
your
you
better
go
i
sit
up
awhile
yet
i
came
in
because
i
could
settle
my
mind
to
anything
out
he
took
off
his
hat
in
token
of
his
intending
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
evening
at
home
and
put
it
on
the
table
at
his
elbow
his
wife
sewed
at
the
mending
in
her
lap
without
offering
to
act
upon
his
suggestion
it
plain
to
be
seen
that
she
ca
get
along
without
she
have
to
now
replied
the
squire
i
afraid
said
gaylord
softly
that
she
be
down
sick
she
do
look
as
if
she
slept
any
great
deal
since
she
been
gone
i
know
as
i
like
very
much
to
see
her
looking
the
way
she
does
i
guess
you
got
to
take
her
off
why
she
just
been
off
and
could
stay
that
because
she
thought
he
was
here
yet
but
if
he
gone
it
wo
be
the
same
well
we
got
to
fight
it
out
some
way
said
the
squire
it
do
to
give
in
to
it
now
it
always
too
much
of
a
thing
at
the
best
and
if
we
tried
now
to
mend
it
up
it
would
be
ridiculous
i
do
believe
he
would
come
back
at
all
now
and
if
he
did
he
come
back
on
any
equal
terms
he
want
to
have
everything
his
own
way
said
the
squire
as
if
confirming
himself
in
a
conclusion
often
reached
already
in
his
own
mind
i
saw
by
the
way
he
began
that
there
was
anything
to
be
done
with
him
it
was
fight
from
the
word
well
said
gaylord
with
gentle
sceptical
interest
in
the
outcome
if
you
made
up
your
mind
to
that
i
hope
you
be
able
to
carry
it
that
what
i
made
up
my
mind
to
said
her
husband
gaylord
rolled
up
the
sewing
in
her
and
packed
it
away
against
the
side
bracing
it
with
several
pairs
of
newly
darned
socks
and
stockings
neatly
folded
one
into
the
other
she
took
her
time
for
this
and
when
she
rose
at
last
to
go
out
with
her
basket
in
her
hand
the
door
opened
in
her
face
and
marcia
entered
gaylord
shrank
back
and
then
slipped
round
behind
her
daughter
and
vanished
the
girl
took
no
notice
of
her
mother
but
went
and
sat
down
on
her
father
knee
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
dropping
her
haggard
face
on
his
shoulder
she
had
arrived
at
home
a
few
hours
earlier
having
driven
over
from
a
station
ten
miles
distant
on
a
road
that
did
not
pass
near
equity
after
giving
as
much
of
a
shock
to
her
mother
mild
nature
as
it
was
capable
of
receiving
by
her
unexpected
return
she
had
gone
to
her
own
room
and
remained
ever
since
without
seeing
her
father
he
put
up
his
thin
old
hand
and
passed
it
over
her
hair
but
it
was
long
before
either
of
them
spoke
at
last
marcia
lifted
her
head
and
looked
her
father
in
the
face
with
a
smile
so
pitiful
that
he
could
not
bear
to
meet
it
well
father
she
said
well
marsh
he
answered
huskily
what
do
you
think
of
me
now
i
glad
to
have
you
back
again
he
replied
you
know
why
i
came
yes
i
guess
i
she
put
down
her
head
again
and
moaned
and
cried
father
father
with
dry
sobs
when
she
looked
up
confronting
him
with
her
tearless
eyes
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
demanded
desolately
he
tried
to
clear
his
throat
to
speak
but
it
required
more
than
one
effort
to
bring
the
words
i
guess
you
better
go
along
with
me
up
to
boston
going
up
the
first
of
the
no
she
said
quietly
the
change
would
do
you
good
it
a
long
while
since
you
been
away
from
home
her
father
urged
she
looked
at
him
in
sad
reproach
of
his
uncandor
you
know
nothing
the
matter
with
me
father
you
know
what
the
trouble
he
was
silent
he
could
not
face
the
trouble
i
heard
people
talk
of
a
heartache
she
went
on
i
never
believed
there
was
really
such
a
thing
but
i
know
there
is
now
there
a
pain
she
pressed
her
hand
against
her
breast
it
sore
with
aching
what
shall
i
do
i
shall
have
to
live
through
it
if
you
do
feel
exactly
well
said
her
father
i
guess
you
better
see
the
what
shall
i
tell
him
is
the
matter
with
me
that
i
want
bartley
hubbard
he
winced
at
the
words
but
she
did
not
he
knows
that
already
everybody
in
town
does
it
never
been
any
secret
i
could
hide
it
from
the
first
day
i
saw
him
i
just
as
lief
as
not
they
should
say
i
was
dying
for
him
i
shall
not
care
what
they
say
when
i
you
ought
you
ought
to
talk
that
way
marcia
said
her
father
gently
what
difference
she
demanded
scornfully
there
was
truly
no
difference
so
far
as
concerned
any
creed
of
his
and
he
was
too
honest
to
make
further
pretence
what
shall
i
do
she
went
on
again
i
thought
of
praying
but
what
would
be
the
use
i
never
denied
that
there
was
a
god
marcia
said
her
father
oh
i
know
kind
of
god
well
well
i
know
that
i
talk
like
a
crazy
person
do
you
suppose
it
was
providential
my
being
with
you
in
the
office
that
morning
when
bartley
came
in
no
said
her
father
i
do
i
think
it
was
an
mother
said
it
was
providential
my
finding
him
out
before
it
was
too
i
think
it
was
a
good
thing
the
fellow
has
the
making
of
a
scoundrel
in
do
you
think
he
a
scoundrel
now
she
asked
quietly
he
has
had
any
great
opportunity
yet
said
the
old
man
conscientiously
sparing
him
well
then
i
sorry
i
found
him
out
yes
if
i
had
i
might
have
married
him
and
perhaps
if
i
had
died
soon
i
might
never
have
found
him
out
he
could
have
been
good
to
me
a
year
or
two
and
then
if
i
died
i
should
have
been
safe
yes
i
wish
he
could
have
deceived
me
till
after
we
were
married
then
i
have
borne
to
give
him
up
may
you
have
given
him
up
even
then
and
that
the
only
thing
that
reconciles
me
to
it
now
i
sorry
for
you
my
girl
but
you
have
made
me
sorrier
then
sooner
or
later
he
have
broken
your
he
broken
it
now
said
the
girl
calmly
oh
no
he
has
replied
her
father
with
a
false
cheerfulness
that
did
not
deceive
her
you
young
and
you
get
over
it
i
mean
to
take
you
away
from
here
for
a
while
i
mean
to
take
you
up
to
boston
and
on
to
new
york
i
should
care
if
we
went
as
far
as
washington
i
guess
when
you
seen
a
little
more
of
the
world
you
wo
think
bartley
the
only
one
in
she
looked
at
him
so
intently
that
he
thought
she
must
be
pleased
at
his
proposal
do
you
think
i
could
get
him
back
she
asked
her
father
lost
his
patience
it
was
a
relief
to
be
angry
no
i
think
so
i
know
you
could
and
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
mentioning
such
a
thing
oh
ashamed
no
i
got
past
that
i
have
no
shame
any
more
where
concerned
oh
i
give
the
world
if
i
could
call
him
back
if
i
could
only
undo
what
i
did
i
was
wild
i
was
reasonable
i
would
listen
to
him
i
drove
him
away
without
giving
him
a
chance
to
say
a
word
of
course
he
must
hate
me
now
what
makes
you
think
he
would
come
back
she
asked
i
know
he
would
answered
her
father
with
a
sort
of
groan
going
to
leave
equity
for
one
thing
and
going
to
leave
equity
she
repeated
absently
then
he
felt
her
tremble
how
do
you
know
he
going
she
turned
upon
her
father
and
fixed
him
sternly
with
her
eyes
do
you
suppose
he
would
stay
after
what
happened
any
longer
than
he
could
help
how
do
you
know
he
going
she
repeated
he
told
she
stood
up
he
told
you
when
why
where
where
did
you
see
him
she
whispered
in
the
since
since
i
came
bartley
been
here
and
you
did
tell
me
you
did
let
me
know
they
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
at
last
when
is
he
going
she
asked
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
her
mother
had
left
and
clutched
the
back
of
another
on
which
her
fingers
opened
and
closed
convulsively
while
she
caught
her
breath
in
irregular
gasps
she
broke
into
a
low
moaning
at
last
the
expression
of
abject
defeat
in
the
struggle
she
had
waged
with
herself
her
father
watched
her
with
dumb
compassion
better
go
to
bed
marcia
he
said
with
the
same
dry
calm
as
if
he
had
been
sending
her
away
after
some
pleasant
evening
which
she
had
suffered
to
run
too
far
into
the
night
do
you
think
do
you
think
he
have
to
see
you
again
before
he
goes
she
made
out
to
ask
no
he
finished
up
with
me
said
the
old
man
well
then
she
cried
desperately
you
have
to
go
to
him
father
and
get
him
to
come
i
ca
help
it
i
ca
give
him
up
you
got
to
go
to
him
now
father
yes
yes
you
have
you
got
to
go
and
tell
him
go
and
get
him
to
come
for
sake
tell
him
that
i
sorry
that
i
beg
his
pardon
that
i
did
think
i
did
understand
that
i
knew
he
did
do
anything
wrong
she
rose
and
placing
her
hand
on
her
shoulder
accented
each
entreaty
with
a
little
push
he
looked
up
into
her
face
with
a
haggard
smile
of
sympathy
you
crazy
marcia
he
said
gently
do
laugh
she
cried
i
not
crazy
now
but
i
was
then
yes
stark
staring
crazy
look
here
father
i
want
to
tell
you
i
want
to
explain
to
you
she
dropped
upon
his
knee
again
and
tremblingly
passed
her
arm
round
his
neck
you
see
i
had
just
told
him
the
day
before
that
i
care
for
anything
that
happened
before
we
were
engaged
and
then
at
the
very
first
thing
i
went
and
threw
him
off
and
i
had
no
right
to
do
it
he
knows
that
and
that
what
makes
him
so
hard
towards
me
but
if
you
go
and
tell
him
that
i
see
now
i
was
all
wrong
and
that
i
beg
his
pardon
and
then
ask
him
to
give
me
more
trial
just
one
you
can
do
as
much
as
that
for
me
ca
you
oh
you
poor
crazy
girl
groaned
her
father
do
you
see
that
the
trouble
is
in
what
the
fellow
and
not
in
any
particular
thing
that
he
done
he
a
scamp
through
and
through
and
he
all
the
more
a
scamp
when
he
does
know
it
he
has
got
the
first
idea
of
anything
but
no
no
now
i
tell
you
now
i
prove
it
to
you
that
very
sunday
when
we
were
out
riding
together
and
we
met
her
and
her
mother
and
their
sleigh
upset
and
he
had
to
lift
her
back
and
it
made
me
wild
to
see
him
and
i
would
hardly
touch
him
or
speak
to
him
afterwards
he
did
say
one
angry
word
to
me
he
just
pulled
me
up
to
him
and
would
let
me
be
mad
and
he
said
that
night
he
did
mind
it
a
bit
because
it
showed
how
much
i
liked
him
now
does
that
prove
he
good
a
good
deal
better
than
i
am
and
that
he
forgive
me
if
you
go
and
ask
him
i
know
he
is
in
bed
yet
he
always
sits
up
late
he
told
me
so
and
you
find
him
there
in
his
room
go
straight
to
his
room
father
do
let
anybody
see
you
down
in
the
office
i
could
bear
it
and
slip
out
with
him
as
quietly
as
you
can
but
oh
do
hurry
now
do
lose
another
minute
the
wild
joy
sprang
into
her
face
as
her
father
rose
a
joy
that
it
was
terrible
to
him
to
see
die
out
of
it
as
he
spoke
i
tell
you
it
no
use
marcia
he
would
come
if
i
went
to
him
oh
yes
yes
he
would
i
know
he
would
if
he
would
you
mistaken
i
should
have
to
get
down
in
the
dust
for
nothing
he
a
bad
fellow
i
tell
you
and
you
got
to
give
him
you
hate
me
cried
the
girl
the
old
man
walked
to
and
fro
clutching
his
hands
their
lives
had
always
been
in
such
intimate
sympathy
his
life
had
so
long
had
her
happiness
for
its
sole
pleasure
that
the
pang
in
her
heart
racked
his
with
as
sharp
an
agony
well
i
shall
die
and
then
i
hope
you
will
be
marcia
marcia
pleaded
her
father
you
do
know
what
you
you
letting
him
go
away
from
me
you
letting
me
lose
him
killing
me
he
would
come
my
girl
it
would
be
perfectly
useless
to
go
to
him
you
you
try
to
control
yourself
marcia
there
no
other
way
there
no
other
hope
you
disgraceful
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
you
ought
to
have
some
pride
about
you
i
do
know
what
come
over
you
since
you
been
with
that
fellow
you
seem
to
be
out
of
your
senses
but
try
try
my
girl
to
get
over
it
if
you
fight
it
you
conquer
yet
you
got
a
spirit
for
anything
and
i
help
you
marcia
i
take
you
anywhere
i
do
anything
for
you
you
would
go
to
him
and
ask
him
to
come
here
if
it
would
save
his
life
no
said
the
old
man
with
a
desperate
quiet
i
she
stood
looking
at
him
and
then
she
sank
suddenly
and
straight
down
as
if
she
were
sinking
through
the
floor
when
he
lifted
her
he
saw
that
she
was
in
a
dead
faint
and
while
the
swoon
lasted
would
be
out
of
her
misery
the
sight
of
this
had
wrung
him
so
that
he
had
a
kind
of
relief
in
looking
at
her
lifeless
face
and
he
was
slow
in
laying
her
down
again
like
one
that
fears
to
wake
a
sleeping
child
then
he
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
softly
called
to
his
wife
miranda
miranda
ix
kinney
came
into
town
the
next
morning
bright
and
early
as
he
phrased
it
but
he
did
not
stop
at
the
hotel
for
bartley
till
nine
thought
i
give
you
time
for
breakfast
he
exclaimed
and
so
i
did
hurry
up
any
about
gettin
in
my
it
was
a
beautiful
morning
so
blindingly
sunny
that
bartley
winked
as
they
drove
up
through
the
glistening
street
and
was
glad
to
dip
into
the
gloom
of
the
first
woods
it
was
not
cold
the
snow
felt
the
warmth
and
packed
moistly
under
their
runners
the
air
was
perfectly
still
at
a
distance
on
the
it
sparkled
as
if
full
of
diamond
dust
far
overhead
some
crows
called
the
sun
getting
high
said
bartley
with
the
light
sigh
of
one
to
whom
the
thought
of
spring
brings
no
hope
well
i
should
begin
to
plough
for
corn
just
yet
replied
kinney
it
curious
he
went
on
to
see
how
anxious
we
are
to
have
a
thing
over
it
do
much
matter
what
it
is
whether
it
summer
or
winter
i
suppose
we
feel
different
if
we
sure
there
was
going
to
be
another
of
i
guess
that
one
reason
why
the
lord
concluded
not
to
keep
us
clearly
posted
on
the
question
of
another
life
if
it
for
the
uncertainty
of
the
thing
there
are
a
lot
of
fellows
like
you
that
would
stand
it
here
a
minute
why
if
we
had
a
dead
sure
thing
of
good
climate
plenty
to
eat
and
wear
and
not
much
to
do
i
do
believe
any
of
us
would
keep
darling
minnie
waiting
well
a
while
but
you
see
the
thing
all
on
paper
and
that
makes
us
cautious
and
willing
to
hang
on
here
awhile
longer
looks
splendid
on
the
map
streets
regularly
laid
out
public
squares
churches
solid
blocks
of
houses
with
all
the
modern
improvements
but
you
tell
whether
there
any
town
there
till
you
on
the
ground
and
then
if
you
do
like
it
there
no
way
of
gettin
back
to
the
he
turned
round
upon
bartley
and
opened
his
mouth
wide
to
imply
that
this
was
pleasantry
do
you
throw
your
philosophy
in
all
under
the
same
price
kinney
asked
the
young
fellow
well
yes
i
never
charge
anything
over
said
kinney
you
see
i
have
a
good
deal
of
time
to
think
when
i
around
by
myself
all
day
and
the
philosophy
do
cost
me
anything
and
the
fellows
like
it
roughing
it
the
way
they
do
they
can
stand
anything
hey
he
now
not
only
opened
his
mouth
upon
bartley
but
thrust
him
in
the
side
with
his
elbow
and
then
laughed
noisily
kinney
was
the
cook
he
had
been
over
pretty
nearly
the
whole
uninhabitable
globe
starting
as
a
gaunt
and
awkward
boy
from
the
maine
woods
and
keeping
until
he
came
back
to
them
in
late
the
same
gross
and
ridiculous
optimism
he
had
been
at
sea
and
shipwrecked
on
several
islands
in
the
pacific
he
had
passed
a
rainy
season
at
panama
and
a
season
at
vera
cruz
and
had
been
carried
far
into
the
interior
of
peru
by
a
tidal
wave
during
an
earthquake
season
he
was
in
the
border
ruffian
war
of
kansas
and
he
clung
to
california
till
prosperity
deserted
her
after
the
completion
of
the
pacific
road
wherever
he
went
he
carried
or
found
adversity
but
with
a
heart
fed
on
the
metaphysics
of
horace
greeley
and
buoyed
up
by
a
few
wildly
interpreted
maxims
of
emerson
he
had
always
believed
in
other
men
and
their
fitness
for
the
terrestrial
millennium
which
was
never
more
than
ten
days
or
ten
miles
off
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
that
he
had
continued
as
poor
as
he
began
and
that
he
was
never
able
to
contribute
to
those
railroads
mills
elevators
towns
and
cities
which
were
sure
to
be
built
sir
sure
to
be
built
wherever
he
went
when
he
came
home
at
last
to
the
woods
some
hundreds
of
miles
north
of
equity
he
found
that
some
one
had
realized
his
early
dream
of
a
summer
hotel
on
the
shore
of
the
beautiful
lake
there
and
he
unenviously
settled
down
to
admire
the
landlord
thrift
and
to
act
as
guide
and
cook
for
parties
of
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
started
from
the
hotel
to
camp
in
the
woods
this
brought
him
into
the
society
of
cultivated
people
for
which
he
had
a
real
passion
he
had
always
had
a
few
thoughts
rattling
round
in
his
skull
and
he
liked
to
make
sure
of
them
in
talk
with
those
who
had
enjoyed
greater
advantages
than
himself
he
never
begrudged
them
their
luck
he
simply
and
sweetly
admired
them
he
made
studies
of
their
several
characters
and
was
never
tired
of
analyzing
them
to
their
advantage
to
the
next
summer
parties
late
in
the
fall
he
went
in
as
it
is
called
with
a
camp
of
loggers
among
whom
he
rarely
failed
to
find
some
remarkable
men
but
he
confessed
that
he
did
not
enjoy
the
steady
three
or
four
months
in
the
winter
woods
with
no
coming
out
at
all
till
spring
and
he
had
been
glad
of
this
chance
in
a
logging
camp
near
equity
in
which
he
had
been
offered
the
cook
place
by
the
owner
who
had
tested
his
fare
in
the
northern
woods
the
summer
before
its
proximity
to
the
village
allowed
him
to
loaf
in
upon
civilization
at
least
once
a
week
and
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
time
at
the
free
press
office
on
publication
day
he
had
always
sought
the
society
of
newspaper
men
and
wherever
he
could
he
had
given
them
his
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
bartley
was
smart
as
a
steel
trap
and
by
an
early
and
natural
transition
from
calling
the
young
lady
compositors
by
their
pet
names
and
patting
them
on
their
shoulders
he
had
arrived
at
a
like
affectionate
intimacy
with
bartley
as
they
worked
deep
into
the
woods
on
their
way
to
the
camp
the
road
dwindled
to
a
track
between
the
stumps
and
bushes
the
ground
was
rough
and
they
constantly
plunged
down
the
slopes
of
little
hills
and
climbed
the
sides
of
the
little
valleys
and
from
time
to
time
they
had
to
turn
out
for
teams
drawing
logs
to
the
mills
in
equity
each
with
its
equipage
of
four
or
five
wild
young
fellows
who
saluted
kinney
with
an
ironical
cheer
or
jovial
taunt
in
passing
they
all
just
so
he
explained
with
pride
when
the
last
party
had
passed
they
gentlemen
every
one
of
perfect
they
came
at
last
to
a
wider
clearing
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
and
here
on
a
level
of
the
hillside
stretched
the
camp
a
long
low
structure
of
logs
with
the
roof
broken
at
one
point
by
a
stovepipe
and
the
walls
irregularly
pierced
by
small
windows
around
it
crouched
and
burrowed
in
the
drift
the
sheds
that
served
as
stables
and
storehouses
the
sun
shone
and
shone
with
dazzling
brightness
upon
the
opening
the
sound
of
distant
shouts
and
the
rhythmical
stroke
of
axes
came
to
it
out
of
the
forest
but
the
camp
was
deserted
and
in
the
stillness
kinney
voice
seemed
strange
and
alien
walk
in
walk
in
he
said
hospitably
got
to
look
after
my
but
bartley
remained
at
the
door
blinking
in
the
sunshine
and
harking
to
the
near
silence
that
sang
in
his
ears
a
curious
feeling
possessed
him
sickness
of
himself
as
of
some
one
else
a
longing
consciously
helpless
to
be
something
different
a
sense
of
captivity
to
habits
and
thoughts
and
hopes
that
centred
in
himself
and
served
him
alone
terribly
peaceful
around
here
said
kinney
coming
back
to
him
and
joining
him
in
a
survey
of
the
landscape
with
his
hands
on
his
hips
and
a
stem
of
timothy
projecting
from
his
lips
yes
terribly
assented
bartley
but
it
a
bad
way
for
a
man
to
live
as
long
as
he
young
or
haint
got
anybody
that
wants
his
company
more
than
his
be
the
place
for
on
which
ground
bartley
asked
drily
without
taking
his
eyes
from
a
distant
peak
that
showed
through
the
notch
in
the
forest
kinney
laughed
in
as
unselfish
enjoyment
as
if
he
had
made
the
turn
himself
well
that
aint
exactly
what
i
meant
to
say
what
i
meant
was
that
any
man
engaged
in
intellectual
pursuits
wants
to
come
out
and
commune
with
nature
every
little
you
call
the
equity
free
press
intellectual
pursuits
demanded
bartley
with
scorn
i
suppose
it
is
he
added
well
here
i
am
right
on
the
commune
but
nature
such
a
big
thing
i
think
it
takes
two
to
commune
with
well
a
girl
a
help
assented
kinney
i
was
thinking
of
a
girl
exactly
said
bartley
with
a
little
sadness
i
mean
that
if
you
not
in
spiritual
condition
you
apt
to
get
floored
if
you
undertake
to
commune
with
i
guess
that
about
so
if
a
man
got
anything
on
his
mind
a
big
railroad
depot
the
place
for
but
you
run
down
you
ought
to
come
out
here
and
take
a
hand
and
be
a
man
amongst
kinney
talked
partly
for
quantity
and
partly
for
pure
indefinite
good
feeling
bartley
turned
toward
the
door
what
have
you
got
inside
here
kinney
flung
the
door
open
and
followed
his
guest
within
the
first
of
the
cabin
was
used
as
a
dormitory
and
the
sides
were
furnished
with
rough
bunks
from
the
ground
to
the
roof
the
round
unhewn
logs
showed
their
form
everywhere
the
crevices
were
calked
with
moss
and
the
walls
were
warm
and
tight
it
was
dark
between
the
bunks
but
beyond
it
was
lighter
and
bartley
could
see
at
the
farther
end
a
vast
and
three
long
tables
with
benches
at
their
sides
a
huge
stood
on
the
top
of
the
stove
and
various
pots
and
kettles
surrounded
it
come
into
the
and
sit
down
in
the
parlor
said
kinney
drawing
off
his
coat
as
he
walked
forward
take
the
sofa
he
added
indicating
a
movable
bench
he
hung
his
coat
on
a
peg
and
rolled
up
his
and
began
to
whistle
cheerily
like
a
man
who
enjoys
his
work
as
he
threw
open
the
stove
door
and
poked
in
some
sticks
of
fuel
a
brooding
warmth
filled
the
place
and
the
wood
made
a
pleasant
crackling
as
it
took
fire
here
my
desk
said
kinney
pointing
to
a
barrel
that
supported
a
broad
smooth
this
is
where
i
compose
my
favorite
he
turned
round
and
cut
out
of
a
mighty
mass
of
dough
in
a
tin
trough
a
portion
which
he
threw
down
on
his
table
and
attacked
with
a
that
means
pie
hubbard
he
explained
and
pie
means
or
at
a
pinch
today
day
but
you
need
be
troubled
on
that
account
so
and
so
was
yesterday
pie
times
a
week
is
the
word
and
do
you
forget
it
they
say
old
agassiz
kinney
went
on
in
that
easy
familiar
fondness
with
which
our
people
like
to
speak
of
greatness
that
impresses
their
imagination
they
say
old
agassiz
recommended
fish
as
the
best
food
for
the
brain
well
i
do
suppose
but
what
it
is
but
i
do
know
but
what
pie
is
more
stimulating
to
the
fancy
i
saw
anything
like
to
make
ye
yes
said
bartley
nodding
gloomily
i
tried
kinney
laughed
well
i
guess
folks
of
sedentary
pursuits
like
you
and
me
do
need
it
but
these
fellows
that
stamp
round
in
the
snow
all
day
they
want
something
to
keep
their
imagination
goin
and
i
guess
pie
does
it
anyway
they
ca
seem
to
get
enough
of
it
ever
try
apples
when
you
was
at
work
they
say
old
greeley
kep
his
desk
full
of
kep
away
all
the
while
when
he
was
writin
his
editorials
and
one
of
them
german
poets
i
do
know
but
what
it
was
old
gutty
himself
kept
ones
in
drawer
liked
the
smell
of
well
there
a
good
deal
of
apple
in
may
be
it
the
apple
that
does
it
do
know
but
i
guess
if
your
pursuits
are
sedentary
you
better
take
the
apple
bartley
did
not
say
anything
but
he
kept
a
lazily
interested
eye
on
kinney
as
he
rolled
out
his
piecrust
fitted
it
into
his
tins
filled
these
from
a
jar
of
covered
them
with
a
sheet
of
dough
pierced
in
pattern
and
marshalled
them
at
one
side
ready
for
the
oven
if
fish
any
better
for
the
brain
kinney
proceeded
they
complain
of
any
want
of
it
at
least
in
the
salted
form
they
get
three
times
a
week
for
breakfast
as
as
sunday
tuesday
and
thursday
comes
round
and
fridays
i
make
up
a
sort
of
chowder
for
the
kanucks
they
catholics
you
know
and
i
do
believe
in
with
man
religion
it
do
matter
what
it
you
ought
to
be
a
deacon
in
the
first
church
at
equity
said
bartley
is
that
so
why
asked
kinney
oh
they
do
believe
in
interfering
with
any
man
religion
well
said
kinney
thoughtfully
pausing
with
the
in
his
hand
there
such
a
thing
as
being
liberal
i
the
world
tried
the
other
thing
a
good
while
said
bartley
with
cynical
amusement
at
kinney
arrest
it
seemed
to
chill
the
flow
of
the
good
fellow
optimism
so
that
he
assented
with
but
lukewarm
satisfaction
well
that
so
too
and
he
made
up
the
rest
of
his
pies
in
silence
well
he
exclaimed
at
last
as
if
shaking
himself
out
of
an
unpleasant
reverie
i
guess
we
shall
get
along
somehow
do
you
like
pork
and
beans
yes
i
do
said
bartley
we
goin
to
have
for
dinner
you
can
hit
beans
any
meal
you
drop
in
on
us
beans
times
a
week
just
like
pie
set
in
to
warm
he
said
taking
up
a
capacious
earthen
pot
near
the
stove
and
putting
it
into
the
oven
i
been
pretty
much
everywheres
and
i
do
know
as
i
found
anything
for
a
that
come
up
to
beans
i
goin
to
give
potatoes
and
cabbage
kind
of
a
day
but
see
there
aint
one
in
ten
touch
to
what
there
will
these
old
residenters
potatoes
and
cabbage
do
for
a
kind
of
a
delicacy
sort
of
a
you
know
but
give
beans
for
a
steady
diet
why
off
there
in
chili
even
the
people
regularly
live
on
beans
not
exactly
like
ours
broad
and
flat
but
they
beans
there
some
those
ancients
old
horace
or
virgil
may
be
rung
in
something
about
beans
in
some
their
poems
i
do
remember
anything
of
the
kind
said
bartley
languidly
well
i
do
know
as
can
i
just
have
a
dim
recollection
of
language
thrown
out
at
the
object
as
old
matthew
arnold
says
but
it
might
have
been
something
in
bartley
laughed
i
did
suppose
you
were
such
a
reader
oh
i
nibble
round
wherever
i
can
get
a
chance
mostly
in
the
newspapers
you
know
i
do
get
any
time
for
books
as
a
general
rule
but
pretty
much
everything
in
the
papers
i
should
call
beans
a
brain
i
guess
you
call
anything
a
brain
food
that
you
happen
to
like
do
you
kinney
no
sir
said
kinney
soberly
but
i
like
to
see
the
philosophy
of
a
thing
when
i
get
a
chance
now
there
tea
for
example
he
said
pointing
to
the
great
tin
pot
on
the
stove
coffee
you
mean
said
bartley
no
sir
i
mean
tea
that
tea
and
i
give
it
to
three
times
a
day
good
and
strong
molasses
in
it
and
no
milk
that
a
brain
food
if
ever
there
was
one
sets
up
right
on
end
every
time
clears
their
heads
and
keeps
the
cold
i
should
think
you
were
running
a
seminary
for
young
ladies
instead
of
a
said
bartley
no
but
look
at
it
i
in
earnest
about
tea
you
look
at
the
tea
drinkers
and
the
all
the
world
over
look
at
in
our
own
country
all
the
northern
people
and
all
the
people
drink
tea
the
pennsylvanians
and
the
southerners
drink
coffee
why
our
new
england
folks
do
even
know
how
to
coffee
so
it
fit
to
drink
and
it
just
so
all
over
europe
the
russians
drink
tea
and
they
up
those
turks
long
ago
if
the
english
had
kept
from
it
go
anywheres
you
like
in
the
north
and
you
find
drinkin
tea
the
swedes
and
norwegians
in
aroostook
county
drink
it
and
they
drink
it
at
well
what
do
you
think
of
the
french
and
germans
they
drink
coffee
and
they
pretty
smart
active
people
french
and
germans
drink
coffee
kinney
stopped
short
in
his
heated
career
of
generalization
and
scratched
his
shaggy
head
well
he
said
finally
i
guess
they
a
kind
of
a
missing
link
as
old
darwin
he
joined
bartley
in
his
laugh
cordially
and
looked
up
at
the
round
clock
nailed
to
a
log
it
about
time
i
set
my
tables
anyway
well
he
asked
apparently
to
keep
the
conversation
from
flagging
while
he
went
about
this
work
how
is
the
good
old
free
press
getting
along
it
going
to
get
along
without
me
from
this
out
said
bartley
this
is
my
last
week
in
no
retorted
kinney
in
tremendous
astonishment
yes
i
off
at
the
end
of
the
week
squire
gaylord
takes
the
paper
back
for
the
committee
and
i
suppose
henry
bird
will
run
it
for
a
while
or
perhaps
they
stop
it
altogether
it
been
a
losing
business
for
the
why
i
thought
you
bought
it
of
well
that
what
i
expected
to
do
but
the
office
has
made
any
money
all
that
i
saved
is
in
my
colt
and
that
sorrel
bartley
nodded
i
going
away
about
as
poor
as
i
came
i
could
go
much
well
said
kinney
in
the
exhaustion
of
adequate
language
he
went
on
laying
the
plates
and
knives
and
forks
in
silence
these
were
of
undisguised
steel
the
dishes
and
the
drinking
mugs
were
of
that
dense
and
heavy
make
which
the
keepers
of
cheap
restaurants
use
to
protect
themselves
against
breakage
and
which
their
servants
chip
to
the
quick
at
every
edge
kinney
laid
bread
and
crackers
by
each
plate
and
on
each
he
placed
a
vast
slab
of
cold
corned
beef
then
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
pot
in
which
the
cabbage
and
potatoes
were
boiling
together
and
pricked
them
with
a
fork
he
dished
up
the
beans
in
a
succession
of
deep
tins
and
set
them
at
intervals
along
the
tables
and
began
to
talk
again
well
now
i
sorry
i
just
begun
to
feel
real
well
acquainted
with
you
tell
you
the
truth
i
did
take
much
of
a
fancy
to
you
first
is
that
so
asked
bartley
not
much
disturbed
by
the
confession
yes
sir
well
come
to
boil
it
down
said
kinney
with
the
frankness
of
the
analytical
mind
that
disdains
to
spare
itself
in
the
pursuit
of
truth
i
did
like
your
good
clothes
i
do
suppose
i
ever
had
a
suit
of
clothes
to
fit
me
feel
kind
of
ashamed
you
know
when
i
go
into
the
store
and
take
the
first
thing
the
jew
wants
to
put
off
on
to
me
now
i
suppose
you
go
to
macullar
and
parker
in
boston
and
you
get
what
no
i
have
my
measure
at
a
tailor
said
bartley
with
pride
in
the
fact
you
do
say
so
exclaimed
kinney
well
he
said
as
if
he
might
as
well
swallow
this
pill
too
while
he
was
about
it
well
what
the
use
i
never
was
the
figure
for
clothes
anyway
long
gangling
boy
to
start
with
and
a
lean
man
i
found
out
some
time
ago
that
a
fellow
necessarily
a
bad
fellow
because
he
had
money
or
a
good
fellow
because
he
had
but
i
had
quite
got
over
hating
a
man
because
he
had
style
well
i
suppose
it
was
a
kind
of
a
as
old
tylor
calls
it
but
i
tell
you
i
sniffed
round
you
a
good
while
before
i
made
up
my
mind
to
swallow
you
and
that
turnout
of
yours
it
kind
of
staggered
me
after
i
got
over
the
clothes
why
it
so
much
the
colt
any
man
likes
to
ride
after
a
sorrel
colt
and
it
so
much
the
cutter
it
was
the
red
linin
with
pinked
edges
that
you
had
to
your
robe
and
it
was
the
red
ribbon
that
you
had
tied
round
the
waist
of
your
whip
when
i
see
that
ribbon
on
that
whip
damn
you
i
wanted
to
kill
bartley
broke
out
into
a
laugh
but
kinney
went
on
soberly
but
thinks
i
to
myself
now
you
stop
right
here
you
wait
you
give
the
fellow
a
chance
for
his
life
let
him
have
a
chance
to
show
whether
that
goes
all
through
him
first
if
it
does
kill
him
cheerfully
but
give
him
a
chance
well
sir
i
gave
you
the
chance
and
you
showed
that
you
deserved
it
i
guess
you
taught
me
a
lesson
when
i
see
you
at
work
pegging
away
hard
at
something
or
other
every
time
i
went
into
your
office
up
and
coming
with
everybody
and
just
as
ready
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
me
as
the
biggest
bug
in
town
thinks
i
have
made
a
great
mistake
to
kill
that
fellow
kinney
and
i
just
made
up
my
mind
to
like
thanks
said
bartley
with
ironical
gratitude
kinney
did
not
speak
at
once
he
whistled
thoughtfully
through
his
teeth
and
then
he
said
i
tell
you
what
if
you
going
away
poor
i
know
a
wealthy
chap
you
can
raise
a
loan
out
bartley
thought
seriously
for
a
silent
moment
if
your
friend
offers
me
twenty
dollars
i
not
too
well
dressed
to
take
all
right
said
kinney
he
now
dished
up
the
cabbage
and
potatoes
and
throwing
a
fresh
handful
of
tea
into
the
pot
and
filling
it
up
with
water
he
took
down
a
tin
horn
with
which
he
went
to
the
door
and
sounded
a
long
stertorous
note
x
guess
it
was
the
clothes
again
said
kinney
as
he
began
to
wash
his
tins
and
dishes
after
the
dinner
was
over
and
the
men
had
gone
back
to
their
work
i
could
see
eyin
you
over
when
they
first
came
in
and
i
could
see
that
they
did
exactly
like
the
looks
of
it
would
wear
off
in
time
but
it
time
for
it
to
wear
off
and
it
had
to
go
pretty
rusty
for
a
well
i
do
know
as
it
makes
much
difference
to
you
does
it
oh
i
thought
we
got
along
very
well
said
bartley
with
a
careless
yawn
there
was
much
chance
to
get
some
of
the
loggers
were
as
handsome
and
as
he
and
were
of
as
good
origin
and
traditions
though
he
had
some
advantages
of
training
but
his
cutaway
his
trousers
his
scarf
with
a
pin
in
it
had
been
too
much
for
these
young
fellows
in
their
long
boots
and
flannel
shirts
they
looked
at
him
askance
and
despatched
their
meal
with
more
than
their
wonted
swiftness
and
were
off
again
into
the
woods
without
any
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
in
bartley
presence
he
had
perceived
their
grudge
for
he
had
felt
it
in
his
time
but
it
did
not
displease
him
he
had
none
of
the
pain
with
which
kinney
who
had
so
long
bragged
of
him
to
the
loggers
saw
that
his
guest
was
a
failure
i
guess
they
come
out
all
right
in
the
end
he
said
in
this
warm
atmosphere
after
the
gross
and
heavy
dinner
he
had
eaten
he
yawned
again
and
again
he
folded
his
overcoat
into
a
pillow
for
his
bench
and
lay
down
and
lazily
watched
kinney
about
his
work
presently
he
saw
kinney
seated
on
a
block
of
wood
beside
the
stove
with
his
elbow
propped
in
one
hand
and
holding
a
magazine
out
of
which
he
was
reading
he
wore
spectacles
which
gave
him
a
fresh
and
interesting
touch
of
grotesqueness
bartley
found
that
an
empty
barrel
had
been
placed
on
each
side
of
him
evidently
to
keep
him
from
rolling
off
his
bench
hello
he
said
much
obliged
to
you
kinney
i
have
been
taken
such
good
care
of
since
i
can
remember
been
asleep
have
i
about
an
hour
said
kinney
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
and
ignoring
his
agency
in
bartley
comfort
food
for
the
brain
said
bartley
sitting
up
i
should
think
so
dreamt
a
perfect
new
american
cyclopaedia
and
a
pronouncing
gazetteer
thrown
is
that
so
said
kinney
as
if
pleased
with
the
suggestive
character
of
his
cookery
now
established
by
eminent
experiment
bartley
yawned
a
yawn
of
satisfied
sleepiness
and
rubbed
his
hand
over
his
face
i
suppose
he
said
if
i
going
to
write
anything
about
camp
kinney
i
had
better
see
all
there
is
to
well
yes
i
presume
you
had
said
kinney
we
go
over
to
where
they
cuttin
pretty
soon
and
you
can
see
all
there
is
in
an
hour
but
i
presume
you
want
to
see
it
so
as
to
ring
in
some
description
hey
well
that
all
right
but
what
you
going
to
do
with
it
when
you
done
it
now
you
out
of
the
free
press
oh
i
should
have
printed
it
in
the
free
press
anyway
coals
to
newcastle
you
know
i
tell
you
what
i
think
i
do
kinney
i
get
my
outlines
and
then
you
post
me
with
a
lot
of
facts
queer
characters
accidents
romantic
incidents
threatened
starvation
adventures
with
wild
animals
and
i
can
make
something
worth
while
get
out
two
or
three
columns
so
they
can
print
it
in
their
sunday
edition
and
then
i
take
it
up
to
boston
with
me
and
seek
my
fortune
with
well
sir
i
do
it
said
kinney
fired
with
the
poetry
of
the
idea
i
post
you
dumn
i
do
wish
could
write
well
i
use
to
scribble
once
for
an
agricultural
paper
but
i
do
call
that
writin
i
set
down
well
i
guess
as
much
as
sixty
times
to
try
to
write
out
what
i
know
about
loggin
hold
on
cried
bartley
whipping
out
his
notebook
that
that
do
for
the
first
line
in
the
head
i
know
about
large
caps
well
kinney
shut
his
magazine
and
took
his
knee
between
his
hands
closing
one
of
his
eyes
in
order
to
sharpen
his
recollection
he
poured
forth
a
stream
of
reminiscence
mingled
observation
and
personal
experience
bartley
followed
him
with
his
pencil
jotting
down
points
striking
in
lines
and
now
and
then
interrupting
him
with
cries
of
good
capital
it
a
perfect
mine
it
a
mint
by
jove
he
exclaimed
i
make
columns
of
this
i
offer
it
to
one
of
the
magazines
and
come
out
illustrated
go
on
hark
said
kinney
craning
his
neck
forward
to
listen
i
thought
i
heard
but
i
guess
it
well
sir
as
i
was
sayin
they
fetched
that
fellow
into
camp
with
both
feet
frozen
to
the
knees
dumn
it
bells
he
unlimbered
himself
and
hurried
to
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
cabin
which
he
opened
letting
in
a
clear
block
of
the
afternoon
sunshine
and
a
gush
of
music
shot
with
men
voices
and
the
cries
and
laughter
of
women
well
sir
said
kinney
coming
back
and
making
haste
to
roll
down
his
sleeves
and
put
on
his
coat
a
nuisance
a
whole
party
of
folks
two
right
us
i
do
know
who
they
or
where
they
from
but
i
know
where
i
wish
they
well
of
course
it
natural
they
should
want
to
see
a
added
kinney
taking
himself
to
task
for
his
inhospitable
mind
and
there
ai
any
harm
in
it
but
i
wish
they
give
a
fellow
a
notice
the
voices
and
bells
drew
nearer
but
kinney
seemed
resolved
to
observe
the
decorum
of
not
going
to
the
door
till
some
one
knocked
kinney
kinney
hello
kinney
shouted
a
man
voice
as
the
bells
hushed
before
the
door
and
broke
into
a
musical
clash
when
one
of
the
horses
tossed
his
head
well
sir
said
kinney
rising
i
guess
it
old
willett
himself
the
owner
lives
up
to
portland
and
been
threatening
to
come
down
here
all
winter
with
a
party
of
friends
you
just
stay
still
he
added
and
he
paid
himself
the
deference
which
every
true
american
owes
himself
in
his
dealings
with
his
employer
he
went
to
the
door
very
deliberately
and
made
no
haste
on
account
of
the
repeated
cries
of
kinney
kinney
in
which
others
of
the
party
outside
now
joined
when
he
opened
the
door
again
the
first
voice
saluted
him
with
a
roar
of
laughter
why
kinney
i
began
to
think
you
were
dead
no
sir
bartley
heard
kinney
reply
it
takes
more
to
kill
me
than
you
but
now
he
stepped
outside
and
the
talk
became
unintelligible
finally
bartley
heard
what
was
imaginably
willett
voice
saying
well
let
go
in
and
have
a
look
at
it
now
and
with
much
outcry
and
laughter
the
ladies
were
invisibly
helped
to
dismount
and
presently
the
whole
party
came
stamping
and
rustling
in
bartley
blood
tingled
he
liked
this
and
he
stood
quite
with
his
thumbs
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
and
his
elbows
dropped
while
willett
advanced
in
a
friendly
way
ah
hubbard
kinney
told
us
you
were
in
here
and
asked
me
to
introduce
myself
while
he
looked
after
the
horses
my
name
willett
these
are
my
daughters
this
is
macallister
of
montreal
witherby
of
boston
miss
witherby
and
witherby
ought
to
know
each
other
hubbard
is
the
editor
of
the
equity
free
press
witherby
of
the
boston
events
hubbard
oh
and
bartley
bowed
to
the
willett
and
witherby
ladies
and
shook
hands
with
witherby
a
large
solemn
man
with
a
and
tight
rings
of
white
hair
who
treated
him
with
the
pomp
inevitable
to
the
owner
of
a
city
newspaper
in
meeting
a
country
editor
at
the
mention
of
his
name
macallister
a
slight
little
straight
man
in
a
long
ulster
and
a
sealskin
cap
tiddled
farcically
forward
on
his
toes
and
giving
bartley
his
hand
said
ah
haow
macallister
fixed
upon
him
the
eye
of
the
flirt
who
knows
her
man
she
was
of
the
english
type
her
eyes
were
very
large
and
full
and
her
smooth
black
hair
was
drawn
flatly
backward
and
fastened
in
a
knot
just
under
her
dashing
fur
cap
she
wore
a
fur
sack
and
she
was
equipped
against
the
cold
as
exquisitely
as
her
southern
sisters
defend
themselves
from
the
summer
bits
of
warm
color
in
ribbon
and
scarf
flashed
out
here
and
there
when
she
flung
open
her
sack
she
showed
herself
much
more
lavishly
buttoned
and
bugled
and
bangled
than
the
americans
she
sat
clown
on
the
movable
bench
which
bartley
had
vacated
and
crossed
her
feet
very
small
and
saucy
even
in
their
arctics
on
a
stick
of
and
cast
up
her
neat
profile
and
rapidly
made
eyes
at
every
part
of
the
interior
why
it
delicious
you
know
i
never
saw
anything
so
comfortable
i
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
me
life
here
you
she
spoke
very
far
down
in
her
throat
and
with
a
rising
inflection
in
each
sentence
i
going
to
have
a
quarrel
with
you
willett
for
not
telling
me
what
a
delightful
surprise
you
had
for
us
here
oh
but
i
no
idea
of
it
i
assure
you
well
i
glad
you
like
it
macallister
said
willett
with
the
clumsiness
of
american
when
summoned
to
say
something
gallant
if
i
told
you
what
a
surprise
i
had
for
you
it
would
have
been
oh
it
no
good
your
trying
to
get
out
of
it
way
retorted
the
beauty
there
he
comes
now
i
really
in
love
with
him
you
know
she
said
as
kinney
opened
the
door
and
came
hulking
forward
nobody
said
anything
at
once
but
bartley
laughed
finally
and
ventured
well
i
propose
for
you
to
oh
i
dare
say
cried
the
beauty
with
a
lively
effort
of
wit
mr
kinney
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
your
camp
d
ye
know
she
added
as
kinney
drew
near
and
i
beggin
willett
to
let
me
come
and
live
here
among
well
said
kinney
a
little
abashed
at
this
proposition
you
could
do
a
better
thing
for
your
health
i
the
proprietor
of
the
boston
events
turned
about
and
began
to
look
over
the
arrangements
of
the
interior
the
other
ladies
went
with
him
conversing
in
low
tones
these
must
be
the
places
where
the
men
sleep
they
said
gazing
at
the
bunks
we
must
get
kinney
to
explain
things
to
us
said
willett
a
little
restlessly
macallister
jumped
briskly
to
her
feet
oh
yes
do
willett
make
him
explain
everything
i
been
tryin
to
coax
it
out
of
him
but
he
a
tease
kinney
looked
very
sheepish
in
this
character
and
macallister
hooked
bartley
to
her
side
for
the
tour
of
the
interior
i
ca
let
you
away
from
me
hubbard
your
friend
so
satirical
i
afraid
of
him
only
fancy
willett
he
been
talkin
to
about
brain
foods
i
know
he
makin
fun
of
me
and
it
is
kind
is
it
hubbard
she
did
not
give
the
least
notice
to
the
things
that
the
others
looked
at
or
to
kinney
modest
lecture
upon
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
loggers
she
kept
a
little
apart
with
bartley
and
plied
him
with
bravadoes
with
pouts
with
little
cries
of
suspense
in
the
midst
of
this
he
heard
willett
saying
you
ought
to
get
some
one
to
come
and
write
about
this
for
your
paper
but
macallister
was
also
saying
something
with
a
significant
turn
of
her
floating
eyes
and
the
thing
that
concerned
bartley
if
he
were
to
make
his
way
among
the
newspapers
in
boston
slipped
from
his
grasp
like
the
idea
which
we
try
to
seize
in
a
dream
she
made
sure
of
him
for
the
drive
to
the
place
which
they
visited
to
see
the
men
felling
the
trees
by
inviting
him
to
a
seat
at
her
side
in
the
sleigh
this
crowded
the
others
but
she
insisted
and
they
all
gave
way
as
people
must
to
the
caprices
of
a
pretty
woman
her
coquetries
united
british
wilfulness
to
american
nonchalance
and
seemed
to
have
been
graduated
to
the
appreciation
of
garrison
and
lawrence
river
steamboat
and
society
the
willett
ladies
had
already
found
it
necessary
to
explain
to
the
witherby
ladies
that
they
had
met
her
the
summer
before
at
the
and
that
she
had
stopped
at
portland
on
her
way
to
england
they
did
not
know
her
very
well
but
some
friends
of
theirs
did
and
their
father
had
asked
her
to
come
with
them
to
the
camp
they
added
that
the
canadian
ladies
seemed
to
expect
the
gentlemen
to
be
a
great
deal
more
attentive
than
ours
were
they
had
known
as
little
what
to
do
with
macallister
and
compliments
as
his
wife
audacities
but
they
did
not
view
bartley
responsiveness
with
pleasure
if
arts
were
not
subtle
as
bartley
even
in
the
intoxication
of
her
preference
could
not
keep
from
seeing
still
in
his
mood
it
was
consoling
to
be
singled
out
by
her
it
meant
that
even
in
a
he
was
recognizable
by
any
person
of
fashion
as
a
man
of
the
world
it
embittered
him
the
more
against
marcia
while
in
some
sort
it
vindicated
him
to
himself
the
early
winter
sunset
was
beginning
to
tinge
the
snow
with
crimson
when
the
party
started
back
to
camp
where
kinney
was
to
give
them
supper
he
had
it
greatly
on
his
conscience
that
they
should
have
a
good
time
and
he
promoted
it
as
far
as
hot
and
newly
fried
doughnuts
would
go
he
also
opened
a
few
canned
goods
as
he
called
some
very
exclusive
sardines
and
peaches
and
he
made
an
entirely
fresh
pot
of
tea
and
a
pan
of
macallister
made
remarks
across
her
plate
which
were
for
bartley
alone
and
kinney
who
was
seriously
waiting
upon
his
guests
refused
to
respond
to
bartley
joking
reference
to
himself
of
some
questions
and
comments
of
hers
after
supper
when
the
loggers
had
withdrawn
to
the
other
end
of
the
long
hut
she
called
out
to
kinney
oh
tell
them
to
smoke
we
shall
not
mind
it
at
all
i
assure
you
ca
some
of
them
do
something
sing
or
dance
kinney
unbent
a
little
at
this
there
a
among
them
but
he
a
little
stuck
up
and
i
do
know
as
you
could
get
him
to
dance
he
said
in
a
low
tone
what
a
bloated
aristocrat
cried
the
lady
then
the
only
thing
is
for
us
to
dance
first
can
they
play
one
of
can
whistle
like
a
bird
he
can
whistle
like
a
whole
band
answered
kinney
warming
and
of
course
the
kanucks
can
and
what
are
kanucks
is
what
you
call
us
canadians
well
it
aint
quite
the
thing
to
do
said
kinney
penitently
it
is
at
the
thing
to
do
which
are
the
kanucks
she
rose
and
went
forward
with
kinney
in
her
spoiled
way
and
addressed
a
swarthy
young
logger
in
french
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
his
white
teeth
and
turned
to
one
of
his
comrades
then
the
two
rose
and
got
violins
out
of
the
bunks
and
came
forward
others
of
their
race
joined
them
but
the
yankees
hung
gloomily
back
they
clearly
did
not
like
these
liberties
this
patronage
i
shall
have
your
on
his
feet
yet
kinney
said
macallister
as
she
came
back
to
her
place
the
canadians
began
to
play
and
sing
those
gay
gay
airs
of
old
france
which
they
have
kept
unsaddened
through
all
the
dark
events
that
have
changed
the
popular
mood
of
the
mother
country
they
have
matched
words
to
them
in
celebration
of
their
life
on
the
great
rivers
and
in
the
vast
forests
of
the
north
and
in
these
blithe
barcaroles
and
breathes
the
joyous
spirit
of
a
france
that
knows
neither
doubt
nor
care
france
untouched
by
revolution
or
napoleonic
wars
some
of
the
airs
still
keep
the
very
words
that
came
over
seas
with
them
two
hundred
years
ago
the
transition
to
the
dance
was
quick
and
inevitable
a
dozen
slim
young
fellows
were
gliding
about
behind
the
players
pounding
the
hard
earthen
floor
and
singing
in
time
oh
come
come
cried
the
beauty
rising
and
stamping
impatiently
with
her
little
foot
suppose
we
dance
she
pulled
bartley
forward
by
the
hand
her
husband
followed
with
the
taller
miss
willett
two
of
the
canadians
at
the
instance
of
macallister
came
forward
and
politely
asked
the
honor
of
the
other
young
ladies
hands
in
the
dance
their
temper
was
infectious
and
the
cotillon
was
in
full
life
before
their
partners
had
time
to
wonder
at
their
consent
macallister
could
sing
some
of
the
canadian
songs
her
voice
clear
and
fresh
rang
through
those
of
the
men
while
in
at
the
window
thrown
open
for
air
came
the
wild
cries
of
the
forest
the
wail
of
a
catamount
and
the
solemn
hooting
of
a
distant
owl
is
it
jolly
good
fun
she
demanded
when
the
figure
was
finished
and
now
kinney
went
up
to
the
and
prevailed
with
him
to
show
his
skill
he
seemed
to
comply
on
condition
that
the
whistler
should
furnish
the
music
he
came
forward
with
a
bashful
hauteur
bridling
stiffly
like
a
girl
and
struck
into
the
laborious
and
monotonous
jig
which
is
perhaps
our
national
dance
he
was
exquisitely
shaped
and
as
he
danced
he
suppled
more
and
more
while
the
whistler
warbled
a
wilder
and
swifter
strain
and
kept
time
with
his
hands
there
was
something
that
stirred
the
blood
in
the
fury
of
the
strain
and
dance
when
it
was
done
macallister
caught
off
her
cap
and
ran
round
among
the
spectators
to
make
them
pay
she
excused
no
one
and
she
gave
the
money
to
kinney
telling
him
to
get
his
loggers
something
to
keep
the
cold
out
i
should
say
whiskey
if
i
were
in
the
canadian
bush
she
suggested
well
guess
we
say
anything
of
that
sort
in
camp
said
kinney
she
turned
upon
bartley
i
know
hubbard
is
dying
to
do
something
do
something
hubbard
bartley
looked
up
in
surprise
at
this
interpretation
of
his
tacit
wish
to
distinguish
himself
before
her
come
sing
us
some
of
your
student
bartley
vanity
had
confided
the
fact
of
his
college
training
to
her
and
he
was
really
thinking
just
then
that
he
would
like
to
give
them
a
song
for
which
he
had
been
famous
with
his
class
he
borrowed
the
violin
of
a
kanuck
and
sitting
down
strummed
upon
it
the
song
was
one
of
those
which
is
partly
spoken
and
acted
he
really
did
it
very
well
but
the
willett
and
witherby
ladies
did
not
seem
to
understand
it
quite
and
the
gentlemen
looked
as
if
they
thought
this
very
undignified
business
for
an
educated
american
macallister
feigned
a
yawn
and
put
up
her
hand
to
hide
it
what
a
styupid
song
she
said
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
began
to
put
on
her
wraps
the
others
were
glad
of
this
signal
to
go
and
followed
her
example
good
by
she
cried
giving
her
hand
to
kinney
do
think
your
ideas
are
ridiculous
i
think
there
no
end
of
good
sense
in
them
i
assure
you
i
hope
you
wo
leave
off
that
regard
for
the
brain
in
your
cooking
good
by
she
waved
her
hand
to
the
americans
and
then
to
the
kanucks
as
she
passed
out
between
their
respectfully
parted
ranks
adieu
messieurs
she
merely
nodded
to
bartley
the
others
parted
from
him
coldly
as
he
fancied
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
made
responsible
for
that
woman
coquetries
when
he
was
conscious
all
the
time
of
having
forborne
even
to
meet
them
but
this
was
not
so
much
to
his
credit
as
he
imagined
the
flirt
can
only
practise
her
audacities
safely
by
grace
of
those
upon
whom
she
uses
them
and
if
men
really
met
them
there
could
be
no
such
tiling
as
flirting
xi
the
loggers
pulled
off
their
boots
and
got
into
their
bunks
where
some
of
them
lay
and
smoked
while
others
fell
asleep
directly
bartley
made
some
indirect
approaches
to
kinney
for
sympathy
in
the
snub
which
he
had
received
and
which
rankled
in
his
mind
with
unabated
keenness
but
kinney
did
not
respond
your
bed
ready
he
said
you
can
turn
in
whenever
you
what
the
matter
asked
bartley
nothing
the
matter
if
you
say
so
answered
kinney
going
about
some
preparations
for
the
morning
breakfast
bartley
looked
at
his
resentful
back
he
saw
that
he
was
hurt
and
he
surmised
that
kinney
suspected
him
of
making
fun
of
his
eccentricities
to
macallister
he
laughed
at
kinney
and
tried
to
amuse
her
with
him
but
he
could
not
have
made
this
appear
as
harmless
as
it
was
he
rose
from
the
bench
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
shut
with
a
click
the
penknife
with
which
he
had
been
cutting
a
pattern
on
its
edge
i
shall
have
to
say
good
night
to
you
i
believe
he
said
going
to
the
peg
on
which
kinney
had
hung
his
hat
and
overcoat
he
had
them
on
and
was
buttoning
the
coat
in
an
angry
tremor
before
kinney
looked
up
and
realized
what
his
guest
was
about
why
what
why
where
you
goin
he
faltered
in
dismay
to
equity
said
bartley
feeling
in
his
coat
pockets
for
his
gloves
and
drawing
them
on
without
looking
at
kinney
whose
great
hands
were
in
a
pan
of
dough
why
why
no
you
aint
he
protested
with
a
revulsion
of
feeling
that
swept
away
all
his
resentment
and
left
him
nothing
but
remorse
for
his
inhospitality
no
said
bartley
putting
up
the
collar
of
the
first
ulster
worn
by
a
native
in
that
region
why
look
here
cried
kinney
pulling
his
hands
out
of
the
dough
and
making
a
fruitless
effort
to
cleanse
them
upon
each
other
i
do
want
you
to
go
this
do
you
i
sorry
to
disoblige
you
but
i
going
said
bartley
kinney
tried
to
laugh
why
hubbard
why
bartley
why
bart
he
exclaimed
what
the
matter
with
you
i
aint
mad
you
have
an
unfortunate
manner
then
good
he
strode
out
between
the
bunks
full
of
snoring
loggers
kinney
hurried
after
him
imploring
and
protesting
in
a
low
voice
trying
to
get
before
him
and
longing
to
lay
his
floury
paws
upon
him
and
detain
him
by
main
force
but
even
in
his
distress
respecting
bartley
overcoat
too
much
to
touch
it
he
followed
him
out
into
the
freezing
air
in
his
and
besought
him
not
to
be
such
a
fool
it
makes
me
feel
like
the
devil
he
exclaimed
pitifully
you
come
back
now
half
a
minute
and
i
make
it
all
right
with
you
i
know
i
can
you
a
gentleman
and
you
understand
come
back
i
shall
never
get
over
it
if
you
do
i
sorry
said
bartley
but
i
not
going
back
good
oh
good
lordy
lamented
kinney
what
am
i
goin
to
do
why
man
it
a
good
three
mile
and
more
to
equity
and
the
woods
is
full
of
catamounts
i
tell
ye
aint
safe
for
he
kept
following
bartley
down
the
path
to
the
road
i
risk
it
said
bartley
kinney
had
left
the
door
of
the
camp
open
and
the
yells
and
curses
of
the
awakened
sleepers
recalled
him
to
himself
well
well
if
you
will
he
groaned
in
despair
here
that
he
plunged
his
doughy
hand
into
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
roll
of
bills
here
it
is
i
haint
time
to
count
it
but
it
be
all
right
bartley
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
look
round
at
him
keep
your
money
he
said
as
he
plunged
forward
through
the
snow
i
would
touch
a
cent
of
it
to
save
your
all
right
said
kinney
in
hapless
contrition
and
he
returned
to
shut
himself
in
with
the
reproaches
of
the
loggers
and
the
upbraiding
of
his
own
heart
bartley
dashed
along
the
road
in
a
fury
that
kept
him
unconscious
of
the
intense
cold
and
he
passed
half
the
night
when
he
was
once
more
in
his
own
room
packing
his
effects
against
his
departure
next
day
when
all
was
done
he
went
to
bed
half
wishing
that
he
might
never
rise
from
it
again
it
was
not
that
he
cared
for
kinney
that
fool
sulking
was
only
the
climax
of
a
long
series
of
injuries
of
which
he
was
the
victim
at
the
hands
of
a
hypercritical
omnipotence
despite
his
conviction
that
it
was
useless
to
struggle
longer
against
such
injustice
he
lived
through
the
night
and
came
down
late
to
breakfast
which
he
found
stale
and
without
the
compensating
advantage
of
finding
himself
alone
at
the
table
some
ladies
had
lingered
there
to
clear
up
on
the
best
authority
the
distracting
rumors
concerning
him
which
they
had
heard
the
day
before
was
it
true
that
he
had
intended
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
winter
in
logging
and
it
true
that
he
was
going
to
give
up
the
free
press
and
was
it
that
henry
bird
was
going
to
be
the
editor
bartley
gave
a
sarcastic
confirmation
to
all
these
reports
and
went
out
to
the
to
gather
up
some
things
of
his
he
found
henry
bird
there
looking
pale
and
sick
but
at
work
and
seemingly
in
authority
this
was
what
bartley
had
always
intended
when
he
should
go
out
but
he
did
not
like
it
and
he
resented
some
small
changes
that
had
already
been
made
in
the
editor
room
in
tacit
recognition
of
his
purpose
not
to
occupy
it
again
bird
greeted
him
stiffly
the
printer
girls
briefly
nodded
to
him
suppressing
some
little
hysterical
titters
and
tacitly
let
him
feel
that
he
was
no
longer
master
there
while
he
was
in
the
hannah
morrison
came
in
apparently
from
some
errand
outside
and
catching
sight
of
him
stared
and
pertly
passed
him
in
silence
on
his
inkstand
he
found
a
letter
from
squire
gaylord
briefly
auditing
his
last
account
and
enclosing
the
balance
due
him
from
this
the
old
lawyer
with
the
careful
smallness
of
a
village
business
man
had
deducted
various
little
sums
for
things
which
bartley
had
never
expected
to
pay
for
with
a
like
thriftiness
the
landlord
when
bartley
asked
for
his
bill
had
charged
certain
items
that
had
not
appeared
in
the
bills
before
bartley
felt
that
the
charges
were
trumped
up
but
he
was
powerless
to
dispute
them
besides
he
hoped
to
sell
the
landlord
his
colt
and
cutter
and
he
did
not
care
to
prejudice
that
matter
some
bills
from
storekeepers
which
he
thought
he
had
paid
were
handed
to
him
by
the
landlord
and
each
of
the
churches
had
sent
in
a
little
account
for
for
the
past
eighteen
months
he
had
always
believed
himself
at
church
he
outlawed
the
latter
by
tearing
them
to
pieces
in
the
landlord
presence
and
dropping
the
fragments
into
a
spittoon
it
seemed
to
him
that
every
soul
in
equity
was
making
a
clutch
at
the
rapidly
diminishing
sum
of
money
which
squire
gaylord
had
enclosed
to
him
and
which
was
all
he
had
in
the
world
on
the
other
hand
his
popularity
in
the
village
seemed
to
have
vanished
over
night
he
had
sometimes
fancied
a
general
and
rebellious
grief
when
it
should
become
known
that
he
was
going
away
but
instead
there
was
an
acquiescence
amounting
to
airiness
he
wondered
if
anything
about
his
affairs
with
henry
bird
and
hannah
morrison
had
leaked
out
but
he
did
not
care
he
only
wished
to
shake
the
snow
of
equity
off
his
feet
as
soon
as
possible
after
dinner
when
the
boarders
had
gone
out
and
the
loafers
had
not
yet
gathered
in
he
offered
the
landlord
his
colt
and
cutter
bartley
knew
that
the
landlord
wanted
the
colt
but
now
the
latter
said
i
do
know
as
i
care
to
buy
any
horses
right
in
the
winter
this
all
right
answered
bartley
just
have
the
colt
put
into
the
andy
morrison
brought
it
round
the
boy
looked
at
bartley
set
face
with
a
sort
of
affection
his
adoration
for
the
young
man
survived
all
that
he
had
heard
said
against
him
at
home
during
the
series
of
family
quarrels
that
had
ensued
upon
his
father
interview
with
him
he
longed
to
testify
somehow
his
unabated
loyalty
but
he
could
not
think
of
anything
to
do
much
less
to
say
bartley
pitched
his
valise
into
the
cutter
and
then
as
andy
left
the
horse
head
to
give
him
a
hand
with
his
trunk
offered
him
a
dollar
i
do
want
anything
said
the
boy
shyly
refusing
the
money
out
of
pure
affection
but
bartley
mistook
his
motive
and
thought
it
sulky
resentment
oh
very
well
he
said
take
the
landlord
came
out
hold
on
a
minute
he
said
where
you
goin
to
take
the
cars
at
the
junction
answered
bartley
i
know
a
man
there
that
will
buy
the
colt
what
is
it
you
want
the
landlord
stepped
back
a
few
paces
and
surveyed
the
establishment
i
should
like
to
ride
after
that
hoss
he
said
if
you
aint
in
any
great
of
a
get
in
said
bartley
and
the
landlord
took
the
reins
from
time
to
time
as
he
drove
he
rose
up
and
looked
over
the
dashboard
to
study
the
gait
of
the
horse
i
noticed
he
strikes
some
when
he
first
comes
out
in
the
yes
bartley
assented
pulls
he
the
landlord
rose
again
and
scrutinized
the
horse
legs
i
do
know
as
i
ever
noticed
he
capped
his
hock
did
you
done
it
kickin
nights
i
i
guess
the
landlord
drew
the
whip
lightly
across
the
colt
rear
he
shrank
together
and
made
a
little
spring
forward
but
behaved
perfectly
well
i
do
know
as
i
should
always
be
sure
he
would
kick
in
the
no
said
bartley
you
never
can
be
sure
of
they
drove
along
in
silence
at
last
the
landlord
said
well
he
aint
so
fast
as
i
he
not
so
fast
a
horse
as
some
answered
bartley
the
landlord
leaned
over
sidewise
for
an
inspection
of
the
colt
action
forward
haint
never
thought
he
had
a
splint
on
that
forward
off
leg
a
splint
perhaps
he
has
a
they
returned
to
the
hotel
and
both
alighted
skittish
devil
remarked
the
landlord
as
the
colt
quivered
under
the
hand
he
laid
upon
him
he
skittish
said
bartley
the
landlord
retired
as
far
back
as
the
door
and
regarded
the
colt
critically
well
i
you
always
used
him
too
well
ever
to
winded
him
but
dumn
he
do
like
look
here
simpson
said
bartley
very
quietly
you

this
horse
as
well
as
i
do
and
you
know
there
is
an
out
about
him

want
to
buy
him
because
you
always

now
make

groaned
the
landlord

the
whole
rig
just
as
it
stands
colt

and
robe
two
hundred
dollars
promptly
replied
bartley
i

returned
the
landlord
with
equal
promptness
andy
take
hold
of
the
end
of
that
trunk
will
you
the
landlord
allowed
them
to
put
the
trunk
into
the
cutter
bartley
got
in
too
and
shifting
the
baggage
to
one
side
folded
the
robe
around
him
from
his
middle
down
and
took
his
seat
this
colt
can
road
you
right
along
all
day
inside
of
five
minutes
and
he
can
trot
inside
of
every
time
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
well
said
the
landlord
make
it
an
even
bartley
leaned
forward
and
gathered
up
the
reins
let
go
his
head
andy
he
quietly
commanded
make
it
one
and
a
quarter
cried
the
landlord
not
seeing
that
his
chance
was
past
what
do
you
say
what
bartley
said
as
he
touched
the
colt
with
the
whip
the
landlord
never
knew
he
stood
watching
the
cutter
swift
disappearance
up
the
road
in
a
sort
of
stupid
expectation
of
its
return
when
he
realized
that
departure
was
final
he
said
under
his
breath
sold
ye
dumned
old
fool
and
serve
ye
right
and
went
with
a
feeling
of
admiration
for
colt
and
man
that
bordered
on
reverence
xii
this
last
drop
of
the
local
meanness
filled
bartley
bitter
cup
as
he
passed
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
street
he
seemed
to
drain
it
all
he
knew
that
the
old
lawyer
was
there
sitting
by
the
office
stove
drawing
his
hand
across
his
chin
and
bartley
hoped
that
he
was
still
as
miserable
as
he
had
looked
when
he
last
saw
him
but
he
did
not
know
that
by
the
window
in
the
house
which
he
would
not
even
look
at
marcia
sat
in
her
room
with
her
eyes
upon
the
road
famishing
for
the
thousandth
part
of
a
chance
to
see
him
pass
she
saw
him
now
for
the
instant
of
his
coming
and
going
with
eyes
trained
to
take
in
every
point
she
saw
the
preparation
which
seemed
like
final
departure
and
with
a
gasp
of
bartley
as
if
she
were
trying
to
call
after
him
she
sank
back
into
her
chair
and
shut
her
eyes
he
drove
on
plunging
into
the
deep
hollow
beyond
the
house
and
keeping
for
several
miles
the
road
they
had
taken
on
that
sunday
together
but
he
did
not
make
the
turn
that
brought
them
back
to
the
village
again
the
pale
sunset
was
slanting
over
the
snow
when
he
reached
the
junction
for
he
had
slackened
his
colt
pace
after
he
had
put
ten
miles
behind
him
not
choosing
to
reach
a
prospective
purchaser
with
his
horse
all
blown
and
bathed
with
sweat
he
wished
to
be
able
to
say
look
at
him
he
come
fifteen
miles
since
three
and
he
as
keen
as
when
he
this
was
true
when
having
left
his
baggage
at
the
junction
he
drove
another
mile
into
the
country
to
see
the
farmer
of
the
gentleman
who
had
his
here
and
who
had
once
bantered
bartley
to
sell
him
his
colt
the
farmer
was
away
and
would
not
be
at
home
till
the
from
boston
was
in
bartley
looked
at
his
watch
and
saw
that
to
wait
would
lose
him
the
six
there
would
be
no
other
till
eleven
but
it
was
worth
while
the
gentleman
had
said
when
you
want
the
money
for
that
colt
bring
him
over
any
time
my
farmer
will
have
it
ready
for
he
waited
for
the
but
when
the
farmer
arrived
he
was
full
of
all
sorts
of
scruples
and
reluctances
he
said
he
should
not
like
to
buy
it
till
he
had
heard
from
farnham
he
ended
by
offering
bartley
eighty
dollars
for
the
colt
on
his
own
account
he
did
not
want
the
cutter
you
write
to
farnham
said
bartley
that
you
tried
that
plan
with
me
and
it
would
work
he
lost
the
he
made
this
brave
show
of
indifference
but
he
was
disheartened
and
having
carried
the
farmer
home
from
the
junction
for
the
convenience
of
talking
over
the
trade
with
him
he
drove
back
again
through
the
early
in
sullen
desperation
the
weather
had
softened
and
was
threatening
rain
or
snow
the
dark
was
closing
in
spiritlessly
the
colt
shortening
from
a
trot
into
a
short
springy
jolt
dropped
into
a
walk
at
last
as
if
he
were
tired
and
gave
bartley
time
enough
on
his
way
back
to
the
junction
for
reflection
upon
the
disaster
into
which
his
life
had
fallen
these
passages
of
utter
despair
are
commoner
to
the
young
than
they
are
to
those
whom
years
have
experienced
in
the
impermanence
of
any
fate
good
bad
or
indifferent
unless
perhaps
the
last
may
seem
rather
constant
taken
in
reference
to
all
that
had
been
ten
days
ago
the
present
ruin
was
incredible
and
had
nothing
reasonable
in
proof
of
its
existence
then
he
was
prosperously
placed
and
in
the
way
to
better
himself
indefinitely
now
he
was
here
in
the
dark
with
fifteen
dollars
in
his
pocket
and
an
unsalable
horse
on
his
hands
outcast
deserted
homeless
hopeless
and
by
whose
fault
he
owned
even
then
that
he
had
committed
some
follies
but
in
his
sense
of
love
he
had
risen
for
once
in
his
life
to
a
conception
of
and
in
taking
herself
from
him
as
she
did
she
had
taken
from
him
the
highest
incentive
he
had
ever
known
and
had
checked
him
in
his
first
feeble
impulse
to
do
and
be
all
in
all
for
another
it
was
she
who
had
ruined
him
as
he
jumped
out
of
the
cutter
at
the
junction
the
stopped
with
a
cluster
of
in
his
hand
and
cast
their
light
over
the
sorrel
nice
colt
you
got
yes
said
bartley
blanketing
the
horse
do
you
know
anybody
who
wants
to
buy
whose
is
he
asked
the
man
he
mine
shouted
bartley
do
you
think
i
stole
him
i
do
know
where
you
got
him
said
the
man
walking
off
and
making
a
soft
play
of
red
and
green
lights
on
the
snow
beyond
the
narrow
platform
bartley
went
into
the
great
ugly
barn
of
a
station
trembling
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
gouged
and
whittled
near
the
stove
a
pomp
of
timetables
and
luminous
advertisements
of
western
railroads
and
their
decorated
the
wooden
walls
of
the
gentlemen
which
had
been
sanded
to
keep
the
gentlemen
from
writing
and
sketching
upon
them
this
was
the
more
judicious
because
the
ladies
room
in
the
absence
of
tourist
travel
was
locked
in
winter
and
they
were
obliged
to
share
the
gentlemen
in
summer
the
junction
was
a
busy
place
but
after
the
snow
fell
and
until
the
snow
thawed
it
was
a
desolation
relieved
only
by
the
arrival
of
the
sparsely
peopled
from
the
north
and
east
and
by
such
local
travellers
as
wished
to
take
trains
not
stopping
at
their
own
stations
these
broke
in
upon
the
solitude
of
the
joint
and
and
with
just
sufficient
frequency
to
keep
him
in
a
state
of
uncharitable
irritation
and
unrest
bartley
was
the
sole
intruder
and
he
sat
by
the
stove
wrapped
in
a
cloud
of
rebellious
memories
when
one
side
of
a
colloquy
without
made
itself
heard
what
some
question
was
repeated
no
it
went
down
half
an
hour
an
inaudible
question
followed
next
at
there
was
now
a
faintly
audible
lament
or
appeal
guess
you
have
to
come
earlier
next
time
most
folks
doos
that
wants
to
take
bartley
now
heard
the
despairing
moan
of
a
woman
he
had
already
divined
the
sex
of
the
futile
questioner
whom
the
was
bullying
but
he
had
divined
it
without
compassion
and
if
he
had
not
himself
been
a
sufferer
from
the
man
insolence
he
might
even
have
felt
a
ferocious
satisfaction
in
it
in
a
word
he
was
at
his
lowest
and
worst
when
the
door
opened
and
the
woman
came
in
with
a
movement
at
once
bewildered
and
daring
which
gave
him
the
impression
of
a
despair
as
complete
and
final
as
his
own
he
doggedly
kept
his
place
she
did
not
seem
to
care
for
him
but
in
the
uncertain
light
of
the
lamp
above
them
she
drew
near
the
stove
and
putting
one
hand
to
her
pocket
as
if
to
find
her
handkerchief
she
flung
aside
her
veil
with
her
other
and
showed
her
tear
stained
face
he
was
on
his
feet
somehow
marcia
oh
bartley
he
had
seized
her
by
the
arm
to
make
sure
that
she
was
there
in
verity
of
flesh
and
blood
and
not
by
some
trick
of
his
own
senses
as
a
cold
chill
running
over
him
had
made
him
afraid
at
the
touch
their
passion
ignored
all
that
they
had
made
each
other
suffer
her
head
was
on
his
breast
his
embrace
was
round
her
it
was
a
moment
of
delirious
bliss
that
intervened
between
the
sorrows
that
had
been
and
the
reasons
that
must
come
what
what
are
you
doing
here
marcia
he
asked
at
last
they
sank
on
the
benching
that
ran
round
the
wall
he
held
her
hands
fast
in
one
of
his
and
kept
his
other
arm
about
her
as
they
sat
side
by
side
i
do
know
i
she
seemed
to
rouse
herself
by
an
effort
from
her
rapture
i
was
going
to
see
nettie
spaulding
and
i
saw
you
driving
past
our
house
and
i
thought
you
were
coming
here
and
i
could
bear
i
could
bear
to
let
you
go
away
without
telling
you
that
i
was
wrong
and
asking
asking
you
to
forgive
me
i
thought
you
would
do
it
i
thought
you
would
know
that
i
had
behaved
that
way
because
i
i
cared
so
much
for
you
i
thought
i
was
afraid
you
had
gone
on
the
other
train
she
trembled
and
sank
back
in
his
embrace
from
which
she
had
lifted
herself
a
little
how
did
you
get
here
asked
bartley
as
if
willing
to
give
himself
all
the
proofs
he
could
of
the
reality
of
her
presence
andy
morrison
brought
me
father
sent
him
from
the
hotel
i
did
care
what
you
would
say
to
me
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
was
wrong
and
not
let
you
go
away
feeling
that
that
you
were
all
to
blame
i
thought
when
i
had
done
that
you
might
drive
me
away
or
laugh
at
me
or
anything
you
pleased
if
only
you
would
let
me
take
back
yes
he
answered
dreamily
all
that
wicked
hardness
was
breaking
up
within
him
he
felt
it
melting
drop
by
drop
in
his
heart
this
poor
soul
this
frantic
unguided
reckless
girl
was
an
angel
of
mercy
to
him
and
in
her
folly
and
error
a
messenger
of
heavenly
peace
and
hope
i
am
a
bad
fellow
marcia
he
faltered
you
ought
to
know
that
you
did
right
to
give
me
up
i
made
love
to
hannah
morrison
i
never
promised
to
marry
her
but
i
made
her
think
that
i
was
fond
of
i
do
care
for
that
replied
the
girl
i
told
you
when
we
were
first
engaged
that
i
would
never
think
of
anything
that
had
gone
before
that
and
then
when
i
would
not
listen
to
a
word
from
you
that
day
i
broke
my
when
i
struck
henry
bird
because
he
was
jealous
of
me
i
was
as
guilty
as
if
i
had
killed
if
you
had
killed
him
i
was
bound
to
you
by
my
word
your
striking
him
was
part
of
the
same
thing
part
of
what
i
had
promised
i
never
would
care
a
gush
of
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
she
saw
them
oh
poor
bartley
poor
bartley
she
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
pressed
it
hard
against
her
heart
and
then
wrapped
her
arms
tight
about
him
and
softly
bemoaned
him
they
drew
a
little
apart
when
the
man
came
in
with
his
lantern
and
set
it
down
to
mend
the
fire
but
as
a
railroad
employee
he
was
far
too
familiar
with
the
love
that
vaunts
itself
on
all
railroad
trains
to
feel
that
he
was
an
intruder
he
scarcely
looked
at
them
and
went
out
when
he
had
mended
the
fire
and
left
it
purring
where
is
andy
morrison
asked
bartley
has
he
gone
back
no
he
is
at
the
hotel
over
there
i
told
him
to
wait
till
i
found
out
when
the
train
went
so
you
inquired
when
it
went
to
boston
said
bartley
with
a
touch
of
his
old
raillery
come
he
added
taking
her
hand
under
his
arm
he
led
her
out
of
the
room
to
where
his
cutter
stood
outside
she
was
astonished
to
find
the
colt
there
i
wonder
i
did
see
it
but
if
i
had
i
should
have
thought
that
you
had
sold
it
and
gone
away
andy
told
me
you
were
coming
here
to
sell
the
colt
when
the
man
told
me
the
express
was
gone
i
knew
you
were
on
they
found
the
boy
stolidly
waiting
for
marcia
on
the
veranda
of
the
hotel
stamping
first
upon
one
foot
and
then
the
other
and
hugging
himself
in
his
as
the
coming
blew
its
first
flakes
in
his
face
is
that
you
andy
asked
bartley
yes
sir
answered
the
boy
without
surprise
at
finding
him
with
marcia
well
here
just
take
hold
of
the
colt
head
a
as
the
boy
obeyed
bartley
threw
the
reins
on
the
dashboard
and
leaped
out
of
the
cutter
and
went
within
he
returned
after
a
brief
absence
followed
by
the
landlord
well
it
ai
more
a
mile
a
half
if
it
that
you
just
keep
straight
along
this
street
and
take
your
first
turn
to
the
left
and
you
right
at
the
house
it
the
first
house
on
the
thanks
returned
bartley
andy
you
tell
the
squire
that
you
left
marcia
with
me
and
i
said
i
would
see
about
her
getting
back
you
need
all
right
said
the
boy
and
he
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
to
get
his
horse
from
the
barn
well
i
be
all
ready
by
the
time
you
here
said
the
landlord
still
holding
the
ajar
luck
you
he
shouted
shutting
it
marcia
locked
both
her
hands
through
bartley
arm
and
leaned
her
head
on
his
shoulder
neither
spoke
for
some
minutes
then
he
asked
marcia
do
you
know
where
you
are
with
you
she
answered
in
a
voice
of
utter
peace
do
you
know
where
we
are
going
he
asked
leaning
over
to
kiss
her
cold
pure
cheek
no
she
answered
in
as
perfect
content
as
before
we
are
going
to
get
he
felt
her
grow
tense
in
her
clasp
upon
his
arm
and
hold
there
rigidly
for
a
moment
while
the
swift
thoughts
whirled
through
her
mind
then
as
if
the
struggle
had
ended
she
silently
relaxed
and
leaned
more
heavily
against
him
there
still
time
to
go
back
marcia
he
said
if
you
wish
that
turn
to
the
right
yonder
will
take
us
to
equity
and
you
can
be
at
home
in
two
she
quivered
i
a
poor
man
i
suppose
you
know
that
i
only
got
fifteen
dollars
in
the
world
and
the
colt
here
i
know
i
can
get
on
i
not
afraid
for
myself
but
if
you
would
rather
wait
if
you
not
perfectly
certain
of
yourself
remember
it
going
to
be
a
struggle
we
going
to
have
some
hard
times
you
forgive
me
she
huskily
asked
for
all
answer
without
moving
her
head
from
where
it
lay
yes
then
the
minister
was
an
old
man
and
he
seemed
quite
dazed
at
the
suddenness
of
their
demand
for
his
services
but
he
gathered
himself
together
and
contrived
to
make
them
man
and
wife
and
to
give
them
his
marriage
certificate
it
seems
as
if
there
were
something
else
he
said
absently
as
he
handed
the
paper
to
bartley
perhaps
it
this
said
bartley
giving
him
a
note
in
return
ah
perhaps
he
replied
in
unabated
perplexity
he
bade
them
serve
god
and
let
them
out
into
the
snowy
night
through
which
they
drove
back
to
the
hotel
the
landlord
had
kindled
a
fire
on
the
hearth
of
the
franklin
stove
in
his
parlor
and
the
blazing
hickory
snapped
in
electrical
sympathy
with
the
storm
when
they
shut
themselves
into
the
bright
room
and
bartley
took
marcia
fondly
into
his
arms
wife
husband
they
sat
down
before
the
fire
hand
in
hand
and
talked
of
the
light
things
that
swim
to
the
top
and
eddy
round
and
round
on
the
surface
of
our
deepest
moods
they
made
merry
over
the
old
minister
perturbation
which
bartley
found
endlessly
amusing
then
he
noticed
that
the
dress
marcia
had
on
was
the
one
she
had
worn
to
the
sociable
in
lower
equity
and
she
said
yes
she
had
put
it
on
because
he
once
said
he
liked
it
he
asked
her
when
and
she
said
oh
she
knew
but
if
he
could
not
remember
she
was
not
going
to
tell
him
then
she
wanted
to
know
if
he
recognized
her
by
the
dress
before
she
lifted
her
veil
in
the
station
no
he
said
with
a
teasing
laugh
i
was
thinking
of
oh
bartley
she
joyfully
reproached
him
you
must
have
been
yes
i
was
i
was
so
mad
at
you
that
i
was
glad
to
have
that
brute
of
a
bullying
woman
bartley
he
sat
holding
her
hand
marcia
he
said
gravely
we
must
write
to
your
father
at
once
and
tell
him
i
want
to
begin
life
in
the
right
way
and
i
think
it
only
fair
to
she
was
enraptured
at
his
magnanimity
bartley
that
you
poor
father
i
declare
bartley
i
afraid
i
had
forgotten
him
it
dreadful
but
put
everything
else
out
of
my
head
i
do
believe
i
died
and
come
to
life
somewhere
else
well
have
said
bartley
and
i
guess
you
better
write
to
your
father
better
write
at
present
he
and
i
are
not
on
speaking
terms
here
he
took
out
his
and
gave
her
his
stylographic
pen
after
striking
the
fist
that
held
it
upon
his
other
fist
in
the
fashion
of
the
amateurs
of
that
reluctant
instrument
in
order
to
bring
down
the
ink
oh
what
that
she
asked
it
a
new
kind
of
pen
i
got
it
for
a
notice
in
the
free
is
henry
bird
going
to
edit
the
paper
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
answered
bartley
i
go
out
and
get
an
envelope
and
ask
the
landlord
what
the
quickest
way
to
get
the
letter
to
your
he
took
up
his
hat
but
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
oh
send
for
him
she
said
are
you
afraid
i
come
back
he
demanded
with
a
laughing
kiss
i
want
to
see
him
about
something
else
well
do
be
gone
they
parted
with
an
embrace
that
would
have
fortified
older
married
people
for
a
year
separation
when
bartley
came
back
she
handed
him
the
leaf
she
had
torn
out
of
his
book
and
sat
down
beside
him
while
he
read
it
with
her
arm
over
his
shoulder
dear
father
the
letter
ran
bartley
and
i
are
married
we
were
married
an
hour
ago
just
across
the
new
hampshire
line
by
the
rev
jessup
bartley
wants
i
should
let
you
know
the
very
first
thing
i
am
going
to
boston
with
bartley
and
as
soon
as
we
get
settled
there
i
will
write
again
i
want
you
should
forgive
us
both
but
if
you
wont
forgive
bartley
you
must
forgive
me
you
were
mistaken
about
bartley
and
i
was
right
bartley
has
told
me
everything
and
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
love
to
mother
i
intend
to
visit
netty
spaulding
but
i
saw
bartley
driving
past
on
his
way
to
the
junction
and
i
determined
to
see
him
if
i
could
before
he
started
for
boston
and
tell
him
i
was
all
wrong
no
matter
what
he
said
or
did
afterwards
i
ought
to
have
told
you
i
meant
to
see
bartley
but
then
you
would
not
have
let
me
come
and
if
i
had
not
come
i
should
have
there
a
good
deal
of
bartley
in
it
said
the
young
man
with
a
laugh
you
do
like
it
yes
i
do
it
all
right
did
you
use
to
take
the
prize
for
composition
at
why
i
think
it
a
very
good
letter
for
when
i
in
such
an
excited
it
beautiful
cried
bartley
laughing
more
and
more
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
marcia
said
her
husband
fondly
what
a
child
you
are
if
ever
i
do
anything
to
betray
your
trust
in
me
there
came
a
shuffling
of
feet
outside
the
door
a
clinking
of
glass
and
crockery
and
a
jarring
sort
of
blow
as
if
some
one
were
trying
to
rap
on
the
panel
with
the
edge
of
a
waiter
bartley
threw
the
door
open
and
found
the
landlord
there
red
and
smiling
with
the
waiter
in
his
hand
i
thought
i
bring
your
supper
in
here
you
know
he
explained
confidentially
so
you
could
have
it
a
little
more
snug
and
my
wife
she
kind
o
got
wind
o
what
was
going
on
women
will
you
know
he
said
with
a
wink
and
she
sent
ye
in
some
hot
biscuit
and
a
little
jell
and
some
of
her
he
set
the
waiter
down
on
the
table
and
stood
admiring
its
mystery
of
napkined
dishes
she
guessed
you
would
object
to
some
cold
chicken
and
she
put
a
little
of
that
on
cost
ye
any
more
he
hastened
to
assure
them
now
this
is
your
room
till
the
train
comes
and
there
aint
agoin
to
anybody
come
in
here
so
you
can
make
yourselves
at
home
and
hope
you
enjoy
your
supper
as
much
as
we
did
ourn
the
night
was
married
there
i
guess
i
let
the
lady
fix
the
table
she
looks
as
if
she
knowed
he
got
himself
out
of
the
room
again
and
then
marcia
who
had
made
him
some
embarrassed
thanks
burst
out
in
praise
of
his
pleasantness
well
he
ought
to
be
pleasant
said
bartley
he
just
beaten
me
on
a
i
sold
him
the
sold
him
the
colt
cried
marcia
tragically
dropping
the
napkin
she
had
lifted
from
the
plate
of
cold
chicken
well
we
could
very
well
have
taken
him
to
boston
with
us
and
we
could
have
got
there
without
selling
him
you
know
you
have
married
a
millionnaire
how
much
did
you
get
for
the
colt
oh
i
did
do
so
badly
i
got
a
hundred
and
fifty
for
and
you
had
fifteen
that
was
before
we
were
married
i
gave
the
minister
five
for
you
i
think
you
are
worth
it
i
wanted
to
give
well
then
you
have
a
hundred
and
sixty
now
is
that
a
great
deal
an
everlasting
lot
said
bartley
with
an
impatient
laugh
do
let
the
supper
cool
marcia
she
silently
set
out
the
feast
but
regarded
it
ruefully
you
ought
to
have
ordered
so
much
bartley
she
said
you
could
afford
i
can
afford
anything
when
i
hungry
besides
i
only
ordered
the
oysters
and
coffee
all
the
rest
is
conscience
money
or
sentiment
from
the
landlord
come
come
cheer
up
now
we
starve
well
i
know
father
will
help
we
count
on
him
said
bartley
now
it
he
put
his
arm
round
her
shoulders
and
pressed
her
against
him
till
she
raised
her
face
for
his
kiss
well
i
she
said
and
the
shadow
lifted
itself
from
their
wedding
feast
and
they
sat
down
and
made
merry
as
if
they
had
all
the
money
in
the
world
to
spend
they
laughed
and
joked
they
praised
the
things
they
liked
and
made
fun
of
the
others
how
strange
how
perfectly
impossible
it
all
seems
why
last
night
i
was
taking
supper
at
kinney
and
hating
you
at
every
mouthful
with
all
my
might
everything
seemed
against
me
and
i
was
feeling
ugly
and
flirting
like
mad
with
a
fool
from
montreal
she
had
come
out
there
from
portland
for
a
frolic
with
the
owners
party
you
made
me
do
it
marcia
he
cried
jestingly
and
remember
that
if
you
want
me
to
be
good
you
must
be
kind
the
other
thing
seems
to
make
me
worse
and
i
will
i
will
she
said
humbly
i
will
try
to
be
kind
and
patient
with
you
i
will
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
and
laughed
poor
poor
old
kinney
he
the
cook
you
know
and
he
thought
i
been
making
fun
of
him
to
that
woman
and
he
behaved
so
after
they
were
gone
that
i
started
home
in
a
rage
and
he
followed
me
out
with
his
hands
all
covered
with
dough
and
wanted
to
stop
me
but
he
could
for
fear
of
spoiling
my
clothes
he
lost
himself
in
another
paroxysm
marcia
smiled
a
little
then
what
sort
of
a
looking
person
was
she
she
tremulously
asked
bartley
stopped
abruptly
not
one
part
as
nor
one
millionth
part
as
bright
as
marcia
hubbard
he
caught
her
and
smothered
her
against
his
breast
i
do
care
i
do
care
she
cried
i
was
to
blame
more
than
you
if
you
flirted
with
her
and
it
serves
me
right
yes
i
will
never
say
anything
to
you
for
anything
that
happened
after
i
behaved
so
to
there
was
anything
else
happened
cried
bartley
and
the
montreal
woman
snubbed
me
soundly
before
she
was
done
with
snubbed
you
exclaimed
marcia
with
illogical
indignation
this
delighted
bartley
so
much
that
it
was
long
before
he
left
off
laughing
over
her
then
they
sat
down
and
were
silent
till
she
said
and
did
you
leave
him
in
a
temper
who
kinney
in
a
perfect
devil
of
a
temper
i
would
even
borrow
some
money
he
wanted
to
lend
write
to
him
bartley
said
his
wife
seriously
i
love
you
so
i
bear
to
have
anybody
bad
friends
with
xiii
the
whole
thing
was
so
crazy
as
bartley
said
that
it
made
no
difference
if
they
kept
up
the
expense
a
few
days
longer
he
took
a
hack
from
the
depot
when
they
arrived
in
boston
and
drove
to
the
revere
house
instead
of
going
up
in
the
he
entered
his
name
on
the
register
with
a
flourish
bartley
hubbard
and
wife
and
asked
for
a
room
and
fire
with
laconic
gruffness
but
the
clerk
knew
him
at
once
for
a
country
person
and
when
the
followed
him
into
the
parlor
where
marcia
sat
in
the
tremor
into
which
she
fell
whenever
bartley
was
out
of
her
sight
the
discerned
her
provinciality
at
a
glance
and
made
free
to
say
that
he
guessed
they
had
better
let
him
take
their
things
up
to
their
room
and
come
up
themselves
after
the
porter
had
got
their
fire
going
all
right
said
bartley
with
hauteur
and
he
added
for
no
reason
be
quick
about
yes
sir
said
the
boy
what
time
is
supper
dinner
i
mean
it
ready
now
good
take
up
the
things
come
just
as
you
are
marcia
let
him
take
your
cap
no
keep
it
on
a
good
many
of
them
come
down
in
their
marcia
put
off
her
sack
and
gloves
and
hastily
repaired
the
ravages
of
travel
as
best
she
could
she
would
have
liked
to
go
to
her
room
just
long
enough
to
brush
her
hair
a
little
and
the
fur
cap
made
her
head
hot
but
she
was
suddenly
afraid
of
doing
something
that
would
seem
countrified
in
bartley
eyes
and
she
promptly
obeyed
they
had
come
from
portland
in
a
parlor
car
and
she
had
been
able
to
make
a
traveller
toilet
before
they
reached
boston
she
had
been
at
portland
several
times
with
her
father
but
he
stopped
at
a
hotel
where
he
had
always
put
up
when
alone
and
she
was
new
to
the
vastness
of
hotel
mirrors
and
chandeliers
the
glossy
paint
the
frescoing
the
fluted
pillars
the
tessellated
marble
pavements
upon
which
she
stepped
when
she
left
the
brussels
carpeting
of
the
parlors
she
clung
to
bartley
arm
silently
praying
that
she
might
not
do
anything
to
mortify
him
and
admiring
everything
he
did
with
all
her
soul
he
made
a
halt
as
they
entered
the
glittering
and
stood
frowning
till
the
ran
respectfully
up
to
them
and
ushered
them
with
sweeping
bows
to
a
table
which
they
had
to
themselves
bartley
ordered
their
dinner
with
nonchalant
ease
beginning
with
soup
and
going
to
black
coffee
with
dazzling
intelligence
while
their
waiter
was
gone
with
their
order
he
beckoned
with
one
finger
to
another
and
sent
him
out
for
a
paper
which
he
unfolded
and
spread
on
the
table
taking
a
toothpick
into
his
mouth
and
running
the
sheet
over
with
his
eyes
i
just
want
to
see
what
going
on
he
said
without
looking
at
marcia
she
made
a
little
murmur
of
acquiescence
in
her
throat
but
she
could
not
speak
for
strangeness
she
began
to
steal
little
timid
glances
about
and
to
notice
the
people
at
the
other
tables
in
her
heart
she
did
not
find
the
ladies
so
very
well
dressed
as
she
had
expected
the
boston
ladies
to
be
and
there
was
no
gentleman
there
to
compare
with
bartley
either
in
style
or
looks
she
let
her
eyes
finally
dwell
on
him
wishing
that
he
would
put
his
paper
away
and
say
something
but
afraid
to
ask
lest
it
should
not
be
quite
right
all
the
other
gentlemen
were
reading
papers
she
was
feeling
lonesome
and
homesick
when
he
suddenly
glanced
at
her
and
said
how
pretty
you
look
marsh
do
i
she
asked
with
a
little
grateful
throb
while
her
eyes
joyfully
suffused
themselves
pretty
as
a
pink
he
returned
gay
is
it
he
continued
with
a
wink
that
took
her
into
his
confidence
again
from
which
his
study
of
the
newspaper
had
seemed
to
exclude
her
i
tell
you
what
i
going
to
do
i
going
to
take
you
to
the
museum
after
dinner
and
let
you
see
boucicault
in
the
bawn
he
swept
his
paper
off
the
table
and
unfolded
his
napkin
in
his
lap
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
began
to
tell
her
about
the
play
we
can
walk
it
only
just
round
the
corner
he
said
at
the
end
marcia
crept
into
the
shelter
of
his
talk
he
sometimes
spoke
rather
loud
and
was
submissively
silent
when
they
got
into
their
own
room
which
had
gilt
lambrequin
frames
and
a
chandelier
of
three
burners
and
a
marble
mantel
and
table
and
washstand
and
bartley
turned
up
the
flaring
gas
she
quite
broke
down
and
cried
on
his
breast
to
make
sure
that
she
had
got
him
all
back
again
why
marcia
he
said
i
know
just
how
you
feel
do
you
suppose
i
understand
as
well
as
you
do
that
we
a
country
couple
but
i
not
going
to
give
myself
away
and
you
must
either
there
was
a
woman
in
that
room
that
could
compare
with
you
or
looks
you
were
splendid
she
whispered
and
just
like
the
rest
and
that
made
me
feel
somehow
as
if
i
had
lost
i
know
i
saw
just
how
you
felt
but
i
was
going
to
say
anything
for
fear
you
give
way
right
there
come
there
plenty
of
time
before
the
play
begins
i
call
this
rather
in
the
decorations
he
said
but
pretty
good
for
its
he
had
pulled
up
two
in
front
of
the
glowing
grate
of
anthracite
as
he
spoke
he
cast
his
eyes
about
the
room
and
she
followed
his
glance
obediently
he
had
kept
her
hand
in
his
and
now
he
held
her
slim
in
the
fist
which
he
rested
on
his
knee
no
i
tell
you
what
marcia
if
you
want
to
get
on
in
a
city
there
no
use
being
afraid
of
people
no
use
being
afraid
of
so
long
as
we
good
to
each
other
and
you
got
to
believe
in
me
right
along
do
you
let
anything
get
you
on
the
wrong
track
i
believe
that
as
long
as
you
have
faith
in
me
i
shall
deserve
it
and
when
you
do
oh
bartley
you
know
i
did
doubt
you
i
just
got
to
thinking
and
i
was
a
little
worked
up
i
suppose
i
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
cried
her
husband
do
you
suppose
i
understand
they
talked
a
long
time
together
and
made
each
other
loving
promises
of
patience
they
confessed
their
faults
and
pledged
each
other
that
they
would
try
hard
to
overcome
them
they
wished
to
be
good
they
both
felt
they
had
much
to
retrieve
but
they
had
no
concealments
and
they
knew
that
was
the
best
way
to
begin
the
future
of
which
they
did
their
best
to
conceive
seriously
bartley
told
her
his
plans
about
getting
some
newspaper
work
till
he
could
complete
his
law
studies
he
meant
to
settle
down
to
practice
in
boston
you
have
to
wait
longer
for
it
than
you
would
in
a
country
place
but
when
you
get
it
it
worth
he
asked
marcia
whether
she
would
look
up
his
friend
halleck
if
she
were
in
his
place
but
he
did
not
give
her
time
to
decide
i
guess
i
wo
do
it
not
just
yet
at
any
rate
he
might
suppose
that
i
wanted
something
of
him
i
call
on
him
when
i
do
need
his
perhaps
if
they
had
not
planned
to
go
to
the
theatre
they
would
have
staid
where
they
were
for
they
were
tired
and
it
was
very
cosey
but
when
they
were
once
in
the
street
they
were
glad
they
had
come
out
bowdoin
square
and
court
street
and
tremont
row
were
a
glitter
of
and
those
shops
with
their
placarded
bargains
dazzled
marcia
is
it
one
of
the
principal
streets
she
asked
bartley
he
gave
the
laugh
of
a
veteran
of
boston
tremont
row
no
wait
till
i
show
you
washington
street
there
the
museum
he
said
pointing
to
the
long
row
of
globed
lights
on
the
façade
of
the
building
here
we
are
in
scollay
square
there
hanover
street
there
cornhill
court
crooks
down
that
way
there
pemberton
his
familiarity
with
these
names
estranged
him
to
her
again
she
clung
the
closer
to
his
arm
and
caught
her
breath
nervously
as
they
turned
in
with
the
crowd
that
was
climbing
the
stairs
to
the
of
the
theatre
bartley
left
her
a
moment
while
he
pushed
his
way
up
to
the
little
window
and
bought
the
tickets
seats
he
said
coming
back
to
her
and
taking
her
hand
under
his
arm
again
and
a
great
piece
of
luck
they
were
just
returned
for
sale
by
the
man
in
front
of
me
or
i
should
have
had
to
take
something
up
in
the
gallery
there
a
regular
jam
these
are
right
in
the
centre
of
the
marcia
did
not
know
what
the
parquet
was
she
heard
its
name
with
the
certainty
that
but
for
bartley
she
should
not
be
equal
to
it
all
her
village
pride
was
quelled
she
had
only
enough
to
act
upon
bartley
instructions
not
to
give
herself
away
by
any
conviction
of
rusticity
they
passed
in
through
the
long
colonnaded
vestibule
with
its
paintings
and
plaster
casts
and
rows
of
birds
and
animals
in
glass
cases
on
either
side
and
she
gave
scarcely
a
glance
at
any
of
those
objects
endeared
by
association
if
not
by
intrinsic
beauty
to
the
boston
gulliver
with
the
liliputians
swarming
upon
him
the
ostriches
and
pelicans
the
mummied
mermaid
under
a
glass
bell
the
governors
portraits
the
stuffed
elephant
washington
crossing
the
delaware
cleopatra
applying
the
asp
sir
william
pepperell
at
full
length
on
canvas
and
the
pagan
months
and
seasons
in
plaster
if
all
these
are
indeed
the
subjects
were
dim
phantasmagoria
amid
which
she
and
bartley
moved
scarcely
more
real
the
usher
in
his
ran
up
the
aisle
to
take
their
checks
and
led
them
down
to
their
seats
half
a
dozen
elegant
people
stood
to
let
them
into
their
places
the
theatre
was
filled
with
faces
at
portland
where
she
saw
the
lady
of
lyons
with
her
father
of
the
house
was
empty
bartley
only
had
time
to
lean
over
and
whisper
the
place
is
packed
with
beacon
street
swells
it
a
regular
field
night
when
the
bell
tinkled
and
the
curtain
rose
as
the
play
went
on
the
rich
flamed
into
her
cheeks
and
burnt
there
a
steady
blaze
to
the
end
the
people
about
her
laughed
and
clapped
and
at
times
they
seemed
to
be
crying
but
marcia
sat
through
every
part
as
stoical
as
a
savage
making
no
sign
except
for
the
flaming
color
in
her
cheeks
of
interest
or
intelligence
bartley
talked
of
the
play
all
the
way
home
but
she
said
nothing
and
in
their
own
room
he
asked
did
you
really
like
it
were
you
disappointed
i
have
been
able
to
get
a
word
out
of
you
about
it
did
you
like
boucicault
i
did
know
which
he
was
she
answered
with
impassioned
exaltation
i
did
care
for
him
i
only
thought
of
that
poor
girl
and
her
husband
who
despised
her
she
stopped
bartley
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
then
caught
her
to
him
and
fell
over
her
till
it
seemed
as
if
he
never
would
end
and
you
thought
you
thought
he
cried
trying
to
get
his
breath
you
thought
you
were
eily
and
i
was
hardress
cregan
oh
i
see
i
see
he
went
on
making
a
mock
and
a
burlesque
of
her
tragical
hallucination
till
she
laughed
with
him
at
last
when
he
put
his
hand
up
to
turn
out
the
gas
he
began
his
joking
afresh
the
real
thing
for
hardress
to
do
he
said
fumbling
for
the
key
is
to
it
out
that
what
hardress
usually
does
when
he
comes
up
from
the
rural
districts
with
eily
on
their
bridal
tour
that
finishes
off
eily
without
troubling
danny
mann
the
only
drawback
is
that
it
finishes
off
hardress
too
they
both
found
suffocated
in
the
xiv
the
next
day
after
breakfast
while
they
stood
together
before
the
parlor
fire
bartley
proposed
one
plan
after
another
for
spending
the
day
marcia
rejected
them
all
with
perfectly
recovered
then
what
we
do
he
asked
at
last
oh
i
do
know
she
answered
rather
absently
she
added
after
an
interval
smoothing
the
warm
front
of
her
dress
and
putting
her
foot
on
the
fender
what
did
those
cost
two
dollars
he
replied
carelessly
why
marcia
gasped
two
dollars
oh
bartley
we
could
afford
it
it
seems
we
and
here
how
much
are
we
paying
here
that
room
with
fire
said
bartley
stretching
himself
is
seven
dollars
a
day
we
must
stay
another
instant
said
marcia
all
a
woman
terror
of
spending
money
on
anything
but
dress
all
a
wife
conservative
instinct
rising
within
her
how
much
have
you
got
left
bartley
took
out
his
and
counted
over
the
bills
in
it
a
hundred
and
twenty
why
what
has
become
of
it
all
we
had
a
hundred
and
sixty
well
our
railroad
tickets
were
nineteen
the
was
three
the
was
three
the
theatre
was
two
the
hack
was
fifty
cents
and
we
have
to
put
down
the
other
two
and
a
half
to
marcia
listened
in
dismay
at
the
end
she
drew
a
long
breath
well
we
must
go
away
from
here
as
soon
as
possible
that
i
know
we
go
out
and
find
some
that
the
first
oh
now
marcia
you
not
going
to
be
so
severe
as
that
are
you
pleaded
bartley
a
few
dollars
more
or
less
are
not
going
to
keep
us
out
of
the
poorhouse
i
just
want
to
stay
here
three
days
that
will
leave
us
a
clean
hundred
and
we
can
start
he
was
half
joking
but
she
was
wholly
serious
no
bartley
not
another
hour
not
another
minute
come
she
took
his
arm
and
bent
it
up
into
a
crook
where
she
put
her
hand
and
pulled
him
toward
the
door
well
after
all
he
said
it
will
be
some
fun
looking
up
a
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
parlor
in
going
to
the
door
they
took
some
waltzing
steps
together
while
she
dressed
to
go
out
he
looked
up
places
where
rooms
were
let
with
or
without
board
in
the
newspaper
there
do
seem
to
be
a
great
many
he
said
meditatively
bending
over
the
open
sheet
but
he
cut
out
half
a
dozen
advertisements
with
his
editorial
scissors
and
they
started
upon
their
search
they
climbed
those
pleasant
old
streets
that
converge
to
the
state
house
and
looked
into
the
houses
on
the
quiet
places
that
stretch
from
one
thoroughfare
to
another
they
had
decided
that
they
would
be
content
with
two
small
rooms
one
for
a
chamber
and
the
other
for
a
parlor
where
they
could
have
a
fire
they
found
exactly
what
they
wanted
in
the
first
house
where
they
applied
one
flight
up
with
sunny
windows
looking
down
the
street
but
it
made
marcia
blood
run
cold
when
the
landlady
said
that
the
price
was
thirty
dollars
a
week
at
another
place
the
rooms
were
only
twenty
the
position
was
as
good
and
the
carpet
and
furniture
prettier
this
was
still
too
dear
but
it
seemed
comparatively
reasonable
till
it
appeared
that
this
was
the
price
without
board
i
think
we
should
prefer
rooms
with
board
should
we
asked
bartley
with
a
sly
look
at
marcia
the
prices
were
of
all
degrees
of
exorbitance
and
they
varied
for
no
reason
from
house
to
house
one
landlady
had
been
accustomed
to
take
more
and
another
less
but
never
little
enough
for
marcia
who
overruled
bartley
again
and
again
when
he
wished
to
close
with
some
small
abatement
of
terms
she
declared
now
that
they
must
put
up
with
one
room
and
they
must
not
care
what
floor
it
was
on
but
the
cheapest
room
with
board
was
fourteen
dollars
a
week
and
marcia
had
fixed
her
ideal
at
ten
even
that
was
too
high
for
them
the
best
way
will
be
to
go
back
to
the
revere
house
at
seven
dollars
a
day
said
bartley
he
had
lately
been
leaving
the
transaction
of
the
business
entirely
to
marcia
who
had
rapidly
acquired
alertness
and
decision
in
it
she
could
not
respond
to
his
joke
what
is
there
left
she
asked
there
is
anything
left
he
said
we
got
to
the
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
pavement
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
and
then
by
a
common
impulse
they
looked
at
the
house
opposite
where
a
placard
in
the
window
advertised
apartments
to
let
to
gentlemen
it
would
be
of
no
use
asking
there
murmured
marcia
in
sad
abstraction
well
let
go
over
and
try
said
her
husband
they
ca
do
more
than
turn
us
out
of
i
know
it
wo
be
of
any
use
marcia
sighed
as
people
do
when
they
hope
to
gain
something
by
forbidding
themselves
hope
but
she
helplessly
followed
and
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
while
he
ran
up
and
rang
it
was
evidently
the
woman
of
the
house
who
came
to
the
door
and
shrewdly
scanned
them
i
see
you
have
apartments
to
let
said
bartley
well
yes
admitted
the
woman
as
if
she
considered
it
useless
to
deny
it
i
i
should
like
to
look
at
them
returned
bartley
with
promptness
come
and
reinforced
by
her
he
invaded
the
premises
before
the
landlady
had
time
to
repel
him
i
tell
you
what
we
want
he
continued
turning
into
the
little
at
the
side
of
the
door
and
if
you
have
got
it
there
no
need
to
trouble
you
we
want
a
room
anywhere
between
the
and
the
roof
with
a
bed
and
a
stove
and
a
table
in
it
that
cost
us
more
than
ten
dollars
a
week
with
set
down
said
the
landlady
herself
setting
the
example
by
sinking
into
the
behind
her
and
beginning
to
rock
while
she
made
a
brief
study
of
the
intruders
want
it
for
yourselves
yes
said
bartley
well
returned
the
landlady
i
always
preferred
single
i
inferred
as
much
from
a
remark
which
you
made
in
your
front
window
said
bartley
indicating
the
placard
the
landlady
smiled
they
were
certainly
a
very
young
couple
and
the
gentleman
was
evidently
nash
liked
bartley
as
most
people
of
her
grade
did
at
once
it
always
my
she
explained
with
the
lazily
rhythmical
drawl
in
which
most
speak
that
i
seemed
to
get
along
rather
better
with
gentlemen
they
give
less
trouble
as
a
general
rule
she
added
with
a
glance
at
marcia
as
if
she
did
not
deny
that
there
were
exceptions
and
marcia
might
be
a
striking
one
bartley
seized
his
advantage
well
my
wife
has
been
married
long
enough
to
be
unreasonable
i
guess
you
get
they
both
laughed
and
marcia
blushing
joined
them
well
i
thought
when
you
first
come
up
the
steps
you
had
been
married
well
not
a
while
said
the
landlady
no
said
bartley
it
seems
a
good
while
to
my
wife
but
we
were
only
married
day
before
the
land
cried
nash
bartley
whispered
marcia
in
soft
upbraiding
what
well
say
last
week
then
we
were
married
last
week
and
we
come
to
boston
to
seek
our
his
wit
overjoyed
nash
you
find
boston
an
awful
hard
place
to
get
along
she
said
shaking
her
head
with
a
warning
smile
i
should
think
so
by
the
price
boston
people
ask
for
their
rooms
returned
bartley
if
i
had
rooms
to
let
i
should
get
along
pretty
this
again
delighted
the
landlady
i
guess
you
aint
goin
to
get
out
of
spirits
anyway
she
said
well
she
continued
i
got
a
room
i
guess
would
suit
you
unexpectedly
she
seemed
to
recur
to
the
language
of
an
advertisement
in
these
words
which
she
pronounced
as
if
reading
them
it
pretty
high
up
she
said
with
another
warning
shake
of
the
head
stairs
to
get
to
it
asked
bartley
plenty
of
well
when
a
place
is
pretty
high
up
i
like
to
have
plenty
of
stairs
to
get
to
it
i
guess
we
see
it
he
rose
well
i
just
go
up
and
see
if
it
to
be
seen
first
said
the
landlady
oh
bartley
said
marcia
when
she
had
left
them
alone
how
you
joke
so
about
our
just
being
married
well
i
saw
she
wanted
awfully
to
ask
and
anybody
can
tell
by
looking
at
us
anyway
we
ca
keep
that
to
ourselves
any
more
than
we
can
our
greenness
besides
it
money
in
our
pockets
she
take
something
off
our
board
for
it
you
see
now
will
you
manage
the
bargaining
from
this
on
i
stepped
forward
because
the
rooms
were
for
gentlemen
i
guess
i
better
said
marcia
all
right
then
i
take
a
back
seat
from
this
oh
i
do
it
wo
be
too
much
sighed
the
young
wife
i
so
you
can
come
right
along
up
the
landlady
called
down
through
the
oval
spire
formed
by
the
ascending
of
the
stairs
they
found
her
in
a
broad
low
room
whose
ceiling
sloped
with
the
roof
and
had
the
pleasant
irregularity
of
the
angles
and
recessions
of
two
dormer
windows
the
room
was
clean
and
cosey
there
was
a
table
and
a
stove
that
could
be
used
open
or
shut
marcia
squeezed
bartley
arm
to
signify
that
it
would
do
perfectly
if
only
the
price
would
suit
the
landlady
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
lectured
now
there
i
get
five
dollars
a
week
for
this
room
and
i
let
it
to
two
gentlemen
it
just
been
vacated
by
two
gentlemen
unexpectedly
and
hard
to
get
gentlemen
at
this
time
the
year
and
that
the
reason
i
thought
of
takin
you
as
i
i
do
much
like
ladies
for
inmates
and
so
i
put
in
the
window
gentlemen
only
but
it
no
use
bein
too
particular
i
ca
have
the
room
layin
empty
on
my
hands
if
it
suits
you
you
can
have
it
for
four
dollars
it
high
up
and
there
no
use
tryin
to
deny
it
but
there
aint
such
another
view
as
them
winders
commands
anywheres
you
can
see
the
harbor
and
pretty
much
the
whole
anything
extra
for
the
view
said
bartley
glancing
out
no
i
throw
that
does
the
price
include
gas
and
fire
asked
marcia
sharpened
as
to
all
details
by
previous
interviews
it
includes
the
gas
but
it
do
include
the
fire
said
the
landlady
firmly
and
it
pretty
low
at
that
as
you
found
out
i
yes
it
is
low
said
marcia
bartley
i
think
we
better
take
she
looked
at
him
timidly
as
if
she
were
afraid
he
might
not
think
it
good
enough
she
did
not
think
it
good
enough
for
him
but
she
felt
that
they
must
make
their
money
go
as
far
as
possible
all
he
said
then
it
a
and
how
much
more
will
the
board
be
well
there
the
landlady
said
with
candor
i
do
know
as
i
can
meet
your
views
i
do
ever
give
board
but
there
plenty
of
houses
right
on
the
street
here
where
you
can
get
from
four
dollars
a
week
oh
dear
sighed
marcia
and
that
would
make
it
twelve
dollars
why
the
dear
suz
child
exclaimed
the
landlady
you
did
expect
to
get
it
for
less
we
must
said
marcia
then
you
have
to
go
to
a
mechanics
i
suppose
we
shall
she
returned
dejectedly
bartley
whistled
look
here
said
the
landlady
aint
you
from
down
east
marcia
started
as
if
the
woman
had
recognized
them
she
said
well
now
said
nash
i
from
down
maine
way
myself
and
i
tell
you
what
i
should
do
if
i
was
in
your
you
do
want
much
of
anything
tor
breakfast
or
tea
you
can
boil
you
an
egg
on
the
stove
here
and
you
can
make
your
own
tea
or
coffee
and
if
i
was
you
i
go
out
for
my
dinners
to
an
i
heard
some
my
lodgers
tellin
how
they
done
well
i
heard
the
very
gentlemen
that
occupied
this
room
sayin
how
they
used
to
go
to
an
and
one
order
one
thing
and
another
another
and
then
they
halve
it
between
and
make
out
a
meal
for
about
a
quarter
apiece
plenty
of
places
now
where
they
give
you
a
cut
or
for
a
shillin
and
they
bring
you
bread
and
butter
and
potato
with
it
an
it
always
enough
for
two
that
what
they
i
haint
never
tried
it
myself
but
as
long
as
you
haint
got
anybody
but
yourselves
to
care
for
there
aint
any
reason
why
they
looked
at
each
other
well
added
the
landlady
for
a
final
touch
fire
that
stove
burn
a
great
deal
all
right
said
bartley
we
take
the
room
for
a
month
at
nash
looked
a
little
embarrassed
if
she
had
made
some
concession
to
the
liking
she
had
conceived
for
this
pretty
young
couple
she
could
not
risk
everything
i
always
have
to
get
the
first
week
in
advance
where
there
ai
no
reference
she
suggested
of
course
said
bartley
and
he
took
out
his
which
he
had
a
boyish
satisfaction
in
letting
her
see
was
well
filled
now
marcia
he
continued
looking
at
his
watch
i
just
run
over
to
the
hotel
and
give
up
our
room
before
they
get
us
in
for
marcia
accepted
nash
invitation
to
come
and
sit
with
her
till
the
chill
was
off
the
room
and
she
borrowed
a
pen
and
paper
of
her
to
write
home
the
note
she
sent
was
brief
she
was
not
going
to
seem
to
ask
anything
of
her
father
but
she
was
going
to
do
what
was
right
she
told
him
where
she
was
and
she
sent
her
love
to
her
mother
she
would
not
speak
of
her
things
he
might
send
them
or
not
as
he
chose
but
she
knew
he
would
this
was
the
spirit
of
her
letter
and
her
training
had
not
taught
her
to
soften
and
sweeten
her
phrase
but
no
doubt
the
old
man
who
was
like
her
would
understand
that
she
felt
no
compunction
for
what
she
had
done
and
that
she
loved
him
though
she
still
defied
him
bartley
did
not
ask
her
what
her
letter
was
when
she
demanded
a
stamp
of
him
on
his
return
but
he
knew
he
inquired
of
nash
where
these
cheap
were
to
be
found
and
he
posted
the
letter
in
the
first
box
they
came
to
merely
saying
i
hope
you
have
been
asking
any
favors
marsh
no
because
i
could
stand
marcia
had
never
dined
in
a
restaurant
and
she
was
somewhat
bewildered
by
the
one
into
which
they
turned
there
was
a
great
show
of
roast
and
steak
and
fish
and
game
and
squash
and
in
the
window
and
at
the
door
a
tack
was
driven
through
a
mass
of
bills
of
fare
two
of
which
bartley
plucked
off
as
they
entered
with
a
knowing
air
and
then
threw
on
the
floor
when
he
found
the
same
thing
on
the
table
the
table
had
a
marble
top
and
a
castor
in
the
centre
the
plates
were
laid
with
a
coarse
red
doily
in
a
cocked
hat
on
each
and
a
thinly
plated
knife
and
fork
crossed
beneath
it
the
plates
were
thick
and
heavy
the
handle
as
well
as
the
blade
of
the
knife
was
metal
and
silvered
besides
the
castor
there
was
a
bottle
of
leicestershire
sauce
on
the
table
and
salt
in
what
marcia
thought
a
the
marble
was
of
an
unctuous
translucence
in
places
and
showed
the
course
of
the
cleansing
napkin
on
its
smeared
surface
the
place
was
hot
and
full
of
confused
smells
of
cooking
all
the
tables
were
crowded
so
that
they
found
places
with
difficulty
and
pale
plain
girls
of
the
provincial
and
type
in
fashionable
bangs
and
went
about
taking
the
orders
which
they
wailed
out
toward
a
semicircular
hole
opening
upon
a
counter
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
there
they
received
the
dishes
ordered
and
hurried
with
them
to
the
customers
before
whom
they
laid
them
with
a
noisy
clacking
of
the
heavy
crockery
a
great
many
of
the
people
seemed
to
be
taking
hulled
corn
and
milk
baked
beans
formed
another
favorite
dish
and
was
in
large
request
marcia
was
not
critical
roast
turkey
for
bartley
and
stewed
chicken
for
herself
with
for
both
seemed
to
her
a
very
good
and
sufficient
dinner
and
better
than
they
ought
to
have
had
she
asked
bartley
if
this
were
anything
like
parker
he
had
always
talked
to
her
about
parker
well
marcia
he
said
folding
up
his
doily
which
does
not
betray
use
like
the
indiscreet
white
napkin
i
just
take
you
round
and
show
you
the
of
parker
and
some
day
we
go
there
and
get
he
not
only
showed
her
parker
but
the
city
hall
they
walked
down
school
street
and
through
washington
as
far
as
boylston
and
bartley
pointed
out
the
old
south
and
brought
marcia
home
by
the
common
where
they
stopped
to
see
the
boys
coasting
under
the
care
of
the
police
between
two
long
lines
of
spectators
the
state
house
said
bartley
with
easy
command
of
the
facts
and
pointing
in
the
several
directions
beacon
street
public
garden
back
she
came
home
to
nash
joyfully
admiring
the
city
but
admiring
still
more
her
husband
masterly
knowledge
of
it
nash
was
one
of
those
people
who
partake
intimately
of
the
importance
of
the
place
in
which
they
live
to
whom
it
is
sufficient
splendor
and
prosperity
to
be
a
bostonian
or
or
chicagoan
and
who
experience
a
delicious
in
the
celebration
of
the
municipal
grandeur
in
his
degree
bartley
was
of
this
sort
and
he
exchanged
compliments
of
boston
with
nash
till
they
grew
into
warm
favor
with
each
other
after
a
while
he
said
he
must
go
and
do
some
writing
and
then
he
casually
dropped
the
fact
that
he
was
an
editor
and
that
he
had
come
to
boston
to
get
an
engagement
on
a
newspaper
he
implied
that
he
had
come
to
take
one
well
said
nash
smoothing
the
back
of
the
cat
which
she
had
in
her
lap
i
guess
there
ai
anything
like
our
boston
papers
and
they
say
this
new
one
the
events
is
goin
to
take
the
lead
you
acquainted
any
with
our
boston
editors
bartley
hemmed
well
i
know
the
proprietor
of
the
ah
yes
witherby
well
they
say
he
got
the
money
i
hear
my
lodgers
talkin
about
that
paper
i
have
ever
seen
bartley
now
went
he
had
an
idea
in
his
head
marcia
remained
with
nash
a
few
moments
he
been
in
boston
before
she
said
with
proud
satisfaction
he
visited
here
when
he
was
in
law
is
he
cried
nash
well
i
thought
he
looked
too
for
that
he
aint
a
bit
offish
he
seems
practical
what
you
hurryin
off
so
for
she
asked
as
marcia
rose
and
stood
poised
on
the
threshold
in
act
to
follow
her
husband
why
do
you
set
here
with
me
while
he
at
his
writin
you
just
keep
talkin
to
him
and
takin
his
mind
off
the
whole
while
you
stay
here
she
commanded
hospitably
you
just
be
in
the
way
up
this
was
a
novel
conception
to
marcia
but
its
good
sense
struck
her
well
i
will
she
said
i
run
up
a
minute
to
leave
my
things
and
then
i
come
she
found
bartley
dragging
the
table
on
which
he
had
already
laid
out
his
into
a
good
light
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
as
if
they
had
been
a
great
while
parted
come
up
to
kiss
me
good
luck
he
asked
finding
her
lips
yes
and
to
tell
you
how
splendid
you
are
going
right
to
work
this
way
she
answered
fondly
oh
i
do
believe
in
losing
time
and
i
got
to
strike
while
the
iron
hot
if
i
going
to
write
out
that
business
i
take
it
over
to
that
events
man
and
hit
him
with
it
while
it
fresh
in
his
yes
said
marcia
are
you
going
to
write
that
out
why
i
told
you
i
was
any
objections
he
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
her
and
he
asked
his
question
jokingly
as
he
went
on
making
his
preparations
it
hard
for
me
to
realize
that
people
can
care
for
such
things
i
thought
perhaps
you
begin
with
something
else
she
suggested
hanging
up
her
sack
and
hat
in
the
closet
no
that
the
very
thing
to
begin
with
he
answered
carelessly
what
are
you
going
to
do
want
that
book
to
read
that
i
bought
on
the
cars
no
i
going
down
to
sit
with
nash
while
you
well
that
a
good
you
can
call
me
when
you
done
cried
bartley
i
be
done
till
this
time
going
to
make
a
lot
about
oh
said
his
wife
well

suppose
the
more
there
is

more
you
will
get
for
it

in
about
those
people
coming
to
see
the
camp
yes
i
think
i
can
work
that
in
so
that
old
witherby
will
like
it
something
about
a
distinguished
boston
newspaper
proprietor
and
his
refined
and
elegant
ladies
as
a
sort
of
contrast
to
the
rude
life
of
the
i
thought
you
did
admire
them
a
great
well
i
did
much
but
i
can
work
them
marcia
was
quite
ready
to
go
bartley
had
seated
himself
at
his
table
but
she
still
hovered
about
and
are
you
shall
you
put
that
montreal
woman
in
yes
get
it
all
in
she
work
up
marcia
was
silent
then
i
should
think
you
put
her
in
she
said
if
she
was
so
silly
and
bartley
turned
around
and
saw
the
look
on
her
face
that
he
could
not
mistake
he
rose
and
took
her
by
the
chin
look
here
marsh
he
said
did
you
promise
me
you
stop
that
yes
she
murmured
while
the
color
flamed
into
her
cheeks
and
will
you
i
try
he
looked
sharply
into
her
eyes
confound
the
montreal
woman
i
wo
put
in
a
word
about
her
there
he
kissed
marcia
and
held
her
in
his
arms
and
soothed
her
as
if
she
had
been
a
jealous
child
oh
bartley
oh
bartley
she
cried
i
love
you
so
i
think
it
a
remark
you
made
before
he
said
and
with
a
final
kiss
and
laugh
he
pushed
her
out
of
the
door
and
she
ran
down
stairs
to
nash
again
your
husband
ever
write
poetry
any
inquired
the
landlady
no
returned
marcia
he
used
to
in
college
but
he
says
it
do
one
my
lodgers
well
she
was
a
lady
you
ca
seem
to
get
gentlemen
oftentimes
in
the
summer
season
for
love
or
money
and
i
was
puttin
up
with
her
breakin
joints
as
you
may
say
for
the
time
bein
wrote
poetry
i
guess
she
found
it
pretty
poor
pickin
used
to
write
for
the
weekly
papers
she
said
the
magazines
well
she
get
more
a
doll
or
two
i
do
know
but
what
less
for
a
piece
as
long
as
nash
held
her
hands
about
a
foot
apart
used
to
show
to
me
and
tell
me
about
i
declare
i
used
to
pity
her
i
used
to
tell
her
i
ruther
break
stone
for
my
marcia
sat
talking
more
than
an
hour
to
nash
informing
herself
upon
the
history
of
nash
past
and
present
lodgers
and
about
the
ways
of
the
city
and
the
prices
of
provisions
and
the
dearness
of
everything
alarmed
and
even
shocked
her
but
she
came
back
to
her
faith
in
bartley
ability
to
meet
and
overcome
all
difficulties
she
grew
drowsy
in
the
close
air
which
nash
loved
after
all
her
fatigues
and
excitements
and
she
said
she
guessed
she
would
go
up
and
see
how
bartley
was
getting
on
but
when
she
stole
into
the
room
and
saw
him
busily
writing
she
said
now
i
wo
speak
a
word
bartley
and
coiled
herself
down
under
a
shawl
on
the
bed
near
enough
to
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
if
she
wished
and
fell
asleep
xv
it
took
bartley
two
days
to
write
out
his
account
of
the
he
worked
it
up
to
the
best
of
his
ability
giving
all
the
facts
that
he
had
got
out
of
kinney
and
relieving
these
with
what
he
considered
picturesque
touches
he
had
the
newspaper
instinct
and
he
divined
that
his
readers
would
not
care
for
his
picturesqueness
without
his
facts
he
therefore
subordinated
this
and
he
tried
to
give
his
description
of
the
loggers
a
interest
dwelling
upon
the
variety
of
nationalities
engaged
in
the
industry
and
the
changes
it
had
undergone
in
what
he
called
its
he
enlarged
upon
its
present
character
and
its
future
development
in
relation
to
what
he
styled
in
a
line
of
small
capitals
with
an
early
use
of
the
favorite
newspaper
possessive
columbia
moribund
and
he
interspersed
his
text
plentifully
with
exclamatory
headings
intended
to
catch
the
eye
with
startling
fragments
of
narration
and
statement
such
as
the
state
storied
staple
more
than
a
million
of
money
unbroken
wilderness
lynxes
and
bears
bitten
off
both
legs
frozen
to
the
knees
canadian
songs
joy
unconfined
the
lamplight
on
their
swarthy
faces
he
spent
a
final
forenoon
in
polishing
his
article
up
and
stuffing
it
full
of
telling
points
but
after
dinner
on
this
last
day
he
took
leave
of
marcia
with
more
trepidation
than
he
was
willing
to
show
or
knew
how
to
conceal
her
devout
faith
in
his
success
seemed
to
unnerve
him
and
he
begged
her
not
to
believe
in
it
so
much
he
seized
what
courage
he
had
left
in
both
hands
and
found
himself
after
the
usual
reluctance
of
the
people
in
the
business
office
face
to
face
with
witherby
in
his
private
room
witherby
had
lately
dismissed
his
managing
editor
for
his
neglect
of
the
true
interests
of
the
paper
as
represented
by
the
and
was
managing
the
events
himself
he
sat
before
a
table
strewn
with
newspapers
and
manuscripts
and
as
he
looked
up
bartley
saw
that
he
did
not
recognize
him
how
do
you
do
witherby
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
the
other
day
in
maine
at
willett
hubbard
is
my
name
remember
me
as
editor
of
the
equity
free
oh
yes
said
witherby
rising
and
standing
at
his
desk
as
a
sort
of
compromise
between
asking
his
visitor
to
sit
down
and
telling
him
to
go
away
he
shook
hands
in
a
loose
way
and
added
i
presume
you
would
like
to
exchange
but
the
fact
is
our
list
is
so
large
already
that
we
extend
it
just
now
we
ca
bartley
smiled
i
do
want
any
exchange
witherby
i
out
of
the
free
ah
said
the
city
journalist
with
relief
he
added
in
a
leading
tone
then
i
come
to
offer
you
an
article
an
account
of
lumbering
in
our
state
it
a
little
sketch
that
i
prepared
from
what
i
saw
in
camp
and
some
facts
and
statistics
i
picked
up
i
thought
it
might
make
an
attractive
feature
of
your
sunday
the
events
said
witherby
solemnly
does
not
publish
a
sunday
edition
of
course
not
answered
bartley
inwardly
cursing
his
blunder
i
mean
your
saturday
evening
he
handed
him
his
manuscript
witherby
looked
at
it
with
the
worry
of
a
dull
man
who
has
assumed
unintelligible
duties
he
had
let
the
other
papers
get
ahead
of
him
on
several
important
enterprises
lately
and
he
would
have
been
glad
to
retrieve
himself
but
he
could
not
be
sure
that
this
was
an
enterprise
he
began
by
saying
that
their
last
saturday
supplement
was
just
out
and
the
next
was
full
and
he
ended
by
declaring
with
stupid
pomp
that
the
events
preferred
to
send
its
own
reporters
to
write
up
those
matters
then
he
hemmed
and
looked
at
bartley
and
he
would
really
have
been
glad
to
have
him
argue
him
out
of
this
position
but
bartley
could
not
divine
what
was
in
his
mind
the
cold
fit
which
sooner
or
later
comes
to
every
form
of
authorship
seized
him
he
said
awkwardly
he
was
very
sorry
and
putting
his
manuscript
back
in
his
pocket
he
went
out
feeling
curiously
as
if
his
rebuff
had
been
a
stunning
blow
the
affair
was
so
quickly
over
that
he
might
well
have
believed
it
had
not
happened
but
he
was
sickeningly
disappointed
he
had
counted
upon
the
sale
of
his
article
to
the
events
his
hope
had
been
founded
upon
actual
knowledge
of
the
proprietor
intention
and
although
he
had
rebuked
marcia
overweening
confidence
he
had
expected
that
witherby
would
jump
at
it
but
witherby
had
not
even
looked
at
it
bartley
walked
a
long
time
in
the
cold
winter
sunshine
fie
would
have
liked
to
go
back
to
his
lodging
and
hide
his
face
in
marcia
hands
and
let
her
pity
him
but
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
her
disappointment
and
he
kept
walking
at
last
he
regained
courage
enough
to
go
to
the
editor
of
the
paper
for
which
he
used
to
correspond
in
the
summer
and
which
had
always
printed
his
letters
this
editor
was
busy
too
but
he
apparently
felt
some
obligations
to
civility
with
bartley
and
though
he
kept
glancing
over
his
exchanges
as
they
talked
he
now
and
then
glanced
at
bartley
also
he
said
that
he
should
be
glad
to
print
the
sketch
but
that
they
never
paid
for
outside
material
and
he
advised
bartley
to
go
with
it
to
the
events
or
to
the
daily
the
abstract
and
the
brief
chronicle
had
lately
consolidated
and
they
were
showing
a
good
deal
of
enterprise
bartley
said
nothing
to
betray
that
he
had
already
been
at
the
events
office
and
upon
this
friendly
editor
invitation
to
drop
in
again
some
time
he
went
away
considerably
if
you
should
happen
to
go
to
the
folks
the
editor
called
after
him
you
can
tell
them
i
suggested
your
the
managing
editor
of
the
was
reading
a
manuscript
and
he
did
not
desist
from
his
work
on
bartley
appearance
which
he
gave
no
sign
of
welcoming
but
he
had
a
whimsical
shrewd
kind
face
and
bartley
felt
that
he
should
get
on
with
him
though
he
did
not
rise
and
though
he
let
bartley
stand
yes
he
said
lumbering
hey
well
there
some
interest
in
that
just
now
on
account
of
this
talk
about
the
decay
of
our
shipbuilding
interests
anything
on
that
point
that
the
very
point
i
touch
on
first
said
bartley
the
editor
stopped
turning
over
his
manuscript
let
see
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
for
bartley
article
he
looked
at
the
first
what
i
know
about
logging
and
smiled
old
but
then
he
glanced
at
the
other
headings
and
ran
his
eye
down
the
long
strips
on
which
bartley
had
written
nibbled
at
the
text
here
and
there
a
little
returned
to
the
first
paragraph
and
read
that
through
looked
back
at
something
else
and
then
read
the
close
i
guess
you
can
leave
it
he
said
laying
the
manuscript
on
the
table
no
i
guess
not
said
bartley
with
equal
coolness
gathering
it
up
the
editor
looked
fairly
at
him
for
the
first
time
and
smiled
evidently
he
liked
this
what
the
reason
any
particular
hurry
i
happen
to
know
that
the
events
is
going
to
send
a
man
down
east
to
write
up
this
very
subject
and
i
do
propose
to
leave
this
article
here
till
they
steal
my
thunder
and
then
have
it
thrown
back
on
my
hands
not
worth
the
paper
it
written
the
editor
tilted
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
braced
his
knees
against
his
table
well
i
guess
you
right
he
said
what
do
you
want
for
it
this
was
a
terrible
question
bartley
knew
nothing
about
the
prices
that
city
papers
paid
he
feared
to
ask
too
much
but
he
also
feared
to
cheapen
his
wares
by
asking
too
little
dollars
he
said
huskily
let
look
at
it
said
the
editor
reaching
out
his
hand
for
the
manuscript
again
sit
he
pushed
a
chair
toward
bartley
with
his
foot
having
first
swept
a
pile
of
newspapers
from
it
to
the
floor
he
now
read
the
article
more
fully
and
then
looked
up
at
bartley
who
sat
still
trying
to
hide
his
anxiety
you
not
quite
a
new
hand
at
the
bellows
are
you
i
edited
a
country
yes
where
down
in
the
editor
bent
forward
and
took
out
a
long
narrow
i
guess
we
shall
want
your
article
what
name
bartley
it
sounded
in
his
ears
like
some
other
name
going
to
be
in
boston
some
time
all
the
time
said
bartley
struggling
to
appear
nonchalant
the
revulsion
from
the
despair
into
which
he
had
fallen
after
his
interview
with
witherby
was
still
very
great
the
order
on
the
which
the
editor
had
given
him
shook
in
his
hand
he
saw
his
way
before
him
clearly
now
he
wished
to
propose
some
other
things
that
he
would
like
to
write
but
he
was
saved
from
this
folly
for
the
time
by
the
saying
in
a
tone
of
dismissal
better
come
in
and
see
a
proof
we
shall
put
you
into
the
wednesday
thanks
said
bartley
good
the
editor
did
not
hear
him
or
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
respond
from
behind
the
newspaper
which
he
had
lifted
up
between
them
and
bartley
went
out
he
did
not
stop
to
cash
his
order
he
made
boyish
haste
to
show
it
to
marcia
as
something
more
authentic
than
the
money
itself
and
more
sacred
as
he
hurried
homeward
he
figured
marcia
ecstasy
in
his
thought
he
saw
himself
flying
up
the
stairs
to
their
attic
three
steps
at
a
bound
and
bursting
into
the
room
where
she
sat
eager
and
anxious
and
flinging
the
order
into
her
lap
and
then
when
she
had
read
it
with
rapture
at
the
sum
and
pride
in
the
smartness
with
which
he
had
managed
the
whole
affair
he
saw
himself
catching
her
up
and
dancing
about
the
floor
with
her
he
thought
how
fond
of
her
he
was
and
he
wondered
that
he
could
ever
have
been
cold
or
lukewarm
she
was
standing
at
the
window
of
nash
little
when
he
reached
the
house
it
was
not
to
be
as
he
had
planned
but
he
threw
her
a
kiss
glad
of
the
impatience
which
would
not
let
her
wait
till
he
could
find
her
in
their
own
room
and
he
had
the
precious
order
in
his
hand
to
dazzle
her
eyes
as
soon
as
he
should
enter
but
as
he
sprang
into
the
hall
his
foot
struck
against
a
trunk
and
some
boxes
hello
he
cried
your
things
have
come
marcia
lingered
within
the
door
of
the
she
seemed
afraid
to
come
out
yes
she
said
faintly
father
brought
them
he
has
just
been
he
seemed
there
still
and
the
vision
unnerved
her
as
if
bartley
and
he
had
been
confronted
there
in
reality
her
husband
had
left
her
hardly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
a
hack
drove
up
to
the
door
and
her
father
alighted
she
let
him
in
herself
before
he
could
ring
and
waited
tremulously
for
what
he
should
do
or
say
but
he
merely
took
her
hand
and
stooping
over
gave
her
the
chary
kiss
with
which
he
used
to
greet
her
at
home
when
he
returned
from
an
absence
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
oh
father
well
well
there
there
he
said
and
then
he
went
into
the
with
her
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
betray
that
anything
unusual
had
happened
since
they
last
met
he
kept
his
hat
on
as
his
fashion
was
and
he
kept
on
his
overcoat
below
which
the
skirts
of
his
hung
an
inch
or
two
he
looked
old
and
weary
and
shabby
i
ca
leave
bartley
father
she
began
hysterically
i
have
come
to
separate
you
from
your
husband
marcia
what
made
you
think
so
it
your
place
to
stay
with
he
out
now
she
answered
in
an
incoherent
hopefulness
he
just
gone
will
you
wait
and
see
him
father
no
i
guess
i
ca
wait
said
the
old
man
it
would
do
any
good
for
us
to
meet
do
you
think
he
coaxed
me
away
he
did
he
took
pity
on
me
he
forgave
me
and
i
did
mean
to
deceive
you
when
i
left
home
father
but
i
could
help
trying
to
see
bartley
i
believe
you
marcia
i
understand
the
thing
had
to
be
let
me
see
your
marriage
she
ran
up
to
her
room
and
fetched
it
her
father
read
it
carefully
yes
that
is
all
right
he
said
and
returned
it
to
her
he
added
after
an
absent
pause
i
have
brought
your
things
marcia
your
mother
packed
all
she
could
think
how
mother
asked
marcia
as
if
this
had
first
reminded
her
of
her
mother
she
is
usually
well
replied
her
father
wo
you
wo
you
come
up
and
see
our
room
father
marcia
asked
after
the
interval
following
this
feint
of
interest
in
her
mother
no
said
the
old
man
rising
restlessly
from
his
chair
and
buttoning
at
his
coat
which
was
already
buttoned
i
guess
i
have
time
i
guess
i
must
be
marcia
put
herself
between
him
and
the
door
wo
you
let
me
tell
you
about
it
father
about
what
how
i
came
to
go
off
with
bartley
i
want
you
should
i
guess
i
know
all
i
want
to
know
about
it
marcia
i
accept
the
facts
i
told
you
how
i
felt
what
you
done
has
changed
me
toward
you
i
understand
you
better
than
you
understand
yourself
and
i
ca
say
that
i
surprised
now
i
want
you
should
make
the
best
of
you
do
forgive
bartley
she
cried
passionately
then
i
do
want
you
should
forgive
me
where
did
you
pick
up
this
nonsense
about
forgiving
said
her
father
knitting
his
shaggy
brows
a
man
does
this
thing
or
that
and
the
consequence
follows
i
could
forgive
bartley
so
that
he
could
escape
any
consequence
of
what
he
done
and
you
not
afraid
i
shall
hurt
him
stay
and
see
him
she
pleaded
he
is
so
kind
to
me
he
works
night
and
day
and
he
has
just
gone
out
to
sell
something
he
has
written
for
the
i
never
said
he
was
lazy
returned
her
father
do
you
want
any
money
marcia
no
we
have
plenty
and
bartley
is
earning
it
all
the
time
i
you
would
stay
and
see
him
no
i
glad
he
did
happen
to
be
in
said
the
squire
i
wait
for
him
to
come
back
it
would
do
any
good
just
yet
marcia
it
would
only
do
harm
bartley
and
i
have
had
time
to
change
our
minds
about
each
other
yet
but
i
say
a
good
word
for
him
to
you
you
his
wife
and
it
your
part
to
help
him
not
to
hinder
him
you
can
make
him
worse
by
being
a
fool
but
you
need
be
a
fool
do
worry
him
about
other
women
do
be
jealous
he
your
husband
now
and
the
worst
thing
you
can
do
is
to
doubt
i
wo
father
i
wo
indeed
i
will
be
good
and
i
will
try
to
be
sensible
oh
i
bartley
could
know
how
you
feel
do
tell
him
from
said
her
father
and
do
keep
making
promises
and
breaking
them
i
help
the
man
in
with
your
he
went
out
and
came
in
again
with
one
end
of
a
trunk
as
if
he
had
been
giving
the
man
a
hand
with
it
into
the
house
at
home
and
she
suffered
him
as
passively
as
she
had
suffered
him
to
do
her
such
services
all
her
life
then
he
took
her
hand
laxly
in
his
and
stooped
down
for
another
chary
kiss
good
by
why
father
are
you
going
to
me
she
faltered
he
smiled
in
melancholy
irony
at
the
bewilderment
the
childish
forgetfulness
of
all
the
circumstances
which
her
words
expressed
oh
no
i
going
to
take
you
with
his
sarcasm
restored
her
to
a
sense
of
what
she
had
said
and
she
ruefully
laughed
at
herself
through
her
tears
what
am
i
talking
about
give
my
love
to
mother
when
will
you
come
again
she
asked
clinging
about
him
almost
in
the
old
playful
way
when
you
want
me
said
the
squire
freeing
himself
i
write
she
cried
after
him
as
he
went
down
the
steps
and
if
there
had
been
at
any
moment
a
consciousness
of
her
cruelty
to
him
in
her
heart
she
lost
it
when
he
drove
away
in
her
anxious
waiting
for
bartley
return
it
seemed
to
her
that
though
her
father
had
refused
to
see
him
his
visit
was
of
happy
augury
for
future
kindness
between
them
and
she
was
proudly
eager
to
tell
bartley
what
good
advice
her
father
had
given
her
but
the
sight
of
her
husband
suddenly
turned
these
thoughts
to
fear
she
trembled
and
all
that
she
could
say
was
i
know
father
will
be
all
right
how
he
retorted
savagely
by
the
way
he
abused
me
to
you
where
is
he
he
gone
gone
i
do
care
where
he
gone
so
he
gone
did
he
come
to
take
you
home
with
him
why
did
you
go
oh
marcia
the
brutal
words
had
hardly
escaped
him
when
he
ran
to
her
as
if
he
would
arrest
them
before
their
sense
should
pierce
her
heart
she
thrust
him
back
with
a
stiffly
extended
arm
keep
away
do
touch
me
she
walked
by
him
up
the
stairs
without
looking
round
at
him
and
he
heard
her
close
their
door
and
lock
it
xvi
bartley
stood
for
a
moment
and
then
went
out
and
wandered
aimlessly
about
till
nightfall
he
went
out
shocked
and
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
and
ready
for
any
reparation
but
this
mood
wore
away
and
he
came
back
sullenly
determined
to
let
her
make
the
advances
toward
reconciliation
if
there
was
to
be
one
her
love
had
already
made
his
peace
and
she
met
him
in
the
dimly
lighted
little
hall
with
a
kiss
of
silent
penitence
and
forgiveness
she
had
on
her
hat
and
shawl
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
to
come
and
take
her
out
to
tea
and
on
their
way
to
the
restaurant
she
asked
him
of
his
adventure
among
the
newspapers
he
told
her
briefly
and
when
they
sat
down
at
their
table
he
took
out
the
precious
order
and
showed
it
to
her
but
its
magic
was
gone
it
was
only
an
order
for
dollars
now
and
two
hours
ago
it
had
been
success
rapture
a
common
hope
and
a
common
joy
they
scarcely
spoke
of
it
but
talked
soberly
of
indifferent
things
she
could
not
recur
to
her
father
visit
at
once
and
he
would
not
be
the
first
to
mention
it
he
did
nothing
to
betray
his
knowledge
of
her
intention
as
she
approached
the
subject
through
those
feints
that
women
use
and
when
they
stood
again
in
their
little
attic
room
she
was
obliged
to
be
explicit
what
hurt
me
bartley
she
said
was
that
you
should
think
for
an
instant
that
i
would
let
father
ask
me
to
leave
you
or
that
he
would
ask
such
a
thing
he
only
came
to
tell
me
to
be
good
to
you
and
help
you
and
trust
you
and
not
worry
you
with
my
silliness
and
and
jealousy
and
i
do
ever
mean
to
and
i
know
he
will
be
good
friends
with
you
yet
he
praised
you
for
working
so
hard
she
pushed
it
a
little
beyond
the
bare
fact
he
always
did
that
and
i
know
he
only
waiting
for
a
good
chance
to
make
it
up
with
she
lifted
her
eyes
glistening
with
tears
and
it
touched
his
peculiar
sense
of
humor
to
find
her
offering
him
reparation
when
he
had
felt
himself
so
outrageously
to
blame
but
he
would
not
be
outdone
in
magnanimity
if
it
came
to
that
it
all
right
marsh
i
was
a
furious
idiot
or
i
should
have
let
you
explain
at
once
but
you
see
i
had
only
one
thought
in
my
mind
and
that
was
my
luck
which
i
wanted
to
share
with
you
and
when
your
father
seemed
to
have
come
in
between
us
again
oh
yes
yes
she
answered
i
and
she
clung
to
him
in
the
joy
of
this
perfect
intelligence
which
she
was
sure
could
never
be
obscured
again
when
bartley
article
came
out
she
read
it
with
a
fond
admiration
which
all
her
praises
seemed
to
leave
unsaid
she
bought
a
and
pasted
the
article
into
it
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
keep
everything
he
wrote
what
are
you
going
to
write
the
next
thing
she
asked
well
that
what
i
do
know
he
answered
i
ca
find
another
subject
like
that
so
why
if
people
care
to
read
about
a
i
should
think
they
would
read
about
almost
anything
nothing
could
be
too
common
for
them
you
might
even
write
about
the
trouble
of
getting
cheap
enough
rooms
in
marcia
cried
bartley
you
a
treasure
i
write
about
that
very
thing
i
know
the
will
be
glad
to
get
she
thought
he
was
joking
till
he
came
to
her
after
a
while
for
some
figures
which
he
did
not
remember
he
had
the
true
newspaper
instinct
and
went
to
work
with
a
motive
that
was
as
different
as
possible
from
the
literary
motive
he
wrote
for
the
effect
which
he
was
to
make
and
not
from
any
artistic
pleasure
in
the
treatment
he
did
not
attempt
to
give
it
form
to
imagine
a
young
couple
like
himself
and
marcia
coming
down
from
the
country
to
place
themselves
in
the
city
he
made
no
effort
to
throw
about
it
the
poetry
of
their
ignorance
and
their
poverty
or
the
pathetic
humor
of
their
dismay
at
the
disproportion
of
the
prices
to
their
means
he
set
about
getting
all
the
facts
he
could
and
he
priced
a
great
many
lodgings
in
different
parts
of
the
city
then
he
went
to
a
number
of
agents
and
giving
himself
out
as
a
reporter
of
the
he
interviewed
them
as
to
past
and
present
upon
these
bottom
facts
as
he
called
them
he
based
a
spicy
sketch
which
had
also
largely
the
character
of
an
there
is
nothing
the
public
enjoys
so
much
as
an
it
seems
to
be
made
in
the
reader
own
interest
it
somehow
constitutes
him
a
party
to
the
attack
upon
the
abuse
and
its
effectiveness
redounds
to
the
credit
of
all
the
newspaper
subscribers
after
a
week
stay
in
boston
bartley
was
able
to
assume
the
feelings
of
a
native
who
sees
his
city
falling
into
decay
through
the
rapacity
of
its
landladies
in
the
heading
of
ten
or
fifteen
lines
which
he
gave
his
sketch
the
greater
number
were
devoted
to
this
feature
of
it
though
the
space
actually
allotted
to
it
in
the
text
was
comparatively
small
he
called
his
report
boston
and
he
spent
a
paragraph
upon
the
relation
of
to
civilization
before
detailing
his
own
experience
and
observation
this
part
had
many
of
those
strokes
of
crude
picturesqueness
and
humor
which
he
knew
how
to
give
and
was
really
entertaining
but
it
was
when
he
came
to
contrast
the
rates
of
and
the
cost
of
provisions
with
the
perpendicular
prices
that
bartley
showed
all
the
virtue
of
a
born
reporter
the
sentences
were
vivid
and
telling
the
was
very
alarming
and
the
conclusion
was
inevitable
that
unless
this
abuse
could
somehow
be
reached
we
should
lose
a
large
and
valuable
portion
of
our
population
especially
those
young
married
people
of
small
means
with
whom
the
city
future
prosperity
so
largely
rested
and
who
must
drift
away
to
find
homes
in
rival
communities
if
the
present
exorbitant
demands
were
maintained
as
bartley
had
foretold
he
had
not
the
least
trouble
in
selling
this
sketch
to
the
the
editor
probably
understood
its
essential
cheapness
perfectly
well
but
he
also
saw
how
thoroughly
readable
it
was
he
did
not
grumble
at
the
increased
price
which
bartley
put
upon
his
work
it
was
still
very
far
from
dear
and
he
liked
the
young
downeaster
enterprise
he
gave
him
as
cordial
a
welcome
as
an
overworked
man
may
venture
to
offer
when
bartley
came
in
with
his
copy
and
he
felt
like
doing
him
a
pleasure
some
things
out
of
the
sketch
had
been
copied
and
people
had
spoken
to
the
editor
about
it
which
was
a
still
better
sign
that
it
was
a
hit
do
you
want
to
come
round
to
our
club
asked
the
editor
as
he
handed
bartley
the
order
for
his
money
across
the
table
we
have
a
bad
dinner
and
we
try
to
have
a
good
time
we
all
newspaper
men
why
thank
you
said
bartley
i
guess
i
should
like
to
well
come
round
at
five
and
go
with
bartley
walked
homeward
rather
soberly
he
had
meant
if
he
sold
this
article
to
make
amends
for
the
disappointment
they
had
both
suffered
before
and
to
have
a
commemorative
supper
with
marcia
at
parker
he
had
ignored
a
little
hint
of
hers
about
his
never
having
taken
her
there
yet
because
he
was
waiting
for
this
chance
to
do
it
in
style
he
resolved
that
if
she
did
not
seem
to
like
his
going
to
the
club
he
would
go
back
and
withdraw
his
acceptance
but
when
he
told
her
he
had
been
invited
he
thought
he
would
put
the
fact
in
this
tentative
way
she
said
i
hope
you
accepted
would
you
have
liked
me
to
he
asked
with
relief
why
of
course
it
a
great
honor
you
get
acquainted
with
all
those
editors
and
perhaps
some
of
them
will
want
to
give
you
a
regular
a
salaried
employment
was
their
common
ideal
of
a
provision
for
their
future
well
that
what
i
was
thinking
myself
said
bartley
go
and
accept
at
once
she
pursued
oh
that
is
necessary
if
i
get
round
there
by
five
i
can
go
he
answered
his
lurking
regret
ceased
when
he
came
into
the
where
the
members
of
the
club
were
constantly
arriving
and
putting
off
their
hats
and
overcoats
and
then
falling
into
groups
for
talk
his
friend
of
the
introduced
him
lavishly
as
our
american
custom
is
bartley
had
a
little
strangeness
but
no
bashfulness
and
with
his
essentially
slight
opinion
of
people
he
was
promptly
at
his
ease
these
men
liked
his
handsome
face
his
winning
voice
the
of
his
instant
readiness
to
joke
he
could
see
that
they
liked
him
and
that
his
friend
ricker
was
proud
of
the
impression
he
made
before
the
evening
was
over
he
kept
himself
with
difficulty
from
patronizing
ricker
a
little
the
club
has
grown
into
something
much
more
splendid
and
expensive
but
it
was
then
content
with
a
dinner
certainly
as
bad
as
ricker
promised
but
fabulously
modest
in
price
at
an
hotel
whose
site
was
long
ago
devoured
by
a
palace
the
drink
was
commonly
water
or
beer
occasionally
if
a
great
actor
or
other
distinguished
guest
honored
the
board
some
spendthrift
ordered
champagne
but
no
one
thought
fit
to
go
to
this
ruinous
extreme
for
bartley
ricker
offered
him
his
choice
of
beer
or
claret
and
bartley
temperately
preferred
water
to
either
he
could
see
that
this
raised
him
in
ricker
esteem
no
company
of
men
can
fail
to
have
a
good
time
at
a
public
dinner
and
the
good
time
began
at
once
with
these
journalists
whose
overworked
week
ended
in
this
saturday
evening
jollity
they
were
mostly
young
men
who
found
sufficient
compensation
in
the
excitement
and
adventure
of
their
underpaid
labors
and
in
the
vague
hope
of
advancement
there
were
grizzled
beards
among
them
for
whom
neither
the
novelty
nor
the
expectation
continued
but
who
loved
the
life
for
its
own
sake
and
would
hardly
have
exchanged
it
for
prosperity
here
and
there
was
an
old
fellow
for
whom
probably
all
the
illusion
was
gone
but
he
was
proud
of
his
vocation
proud
even
of
the
changes
that
left
him
somewhat
superannuated
in
his
tastes
and
methods
none
indeed
who
have
ever
known
it
can
wholly
forget
the
generous
rage
with
which
journalism
inspires
its
followers
to
each
of
those
young
men
beginning
the
strangely
fascinating
life
as
reporters
and
correspondents
his
paper
was
as
dear
as
his
king
once
was
to
a
french
noble
to
serve
it
night
and
day
to
wear
himself
out
for
its
sake
to
merge
himself
in
its
glory
and
to
live
in
its
triumphs
without
personal
recognition
from
the
public
was
the
loyal
devotion
which
each
expected
his
sovereign
newspaper
to
accept
as
its
simple
right
they
went
and
came
with
the
prompt
and
passive
obedience
of
soldiers
wherever
they
were
sent
and
they
struggled
each
to
get
in
ahead
of
all
the
others
with
the
individual
zeal
of
heroes
they
expanded
to
the
utmost
limits
of
occasion
and
they
submitted
with
an
anguish
that
was
silent
to
the
editorial
excision
compression
and
mutilation
of
reports
that
were
vitally
dear
to
them
what
becomes
of
these
ardent
young
spirits
the
inner
history
of
journalism
in
any
great
city
might
pathetically
show
but
the
outside
world
knows
them
only
in
the
fine
frenzy
of
interviewing
or
of
recording
the
midnight
ravages
of
what
they
call
the
devouring
element
or
of
working
up
horrible
murders
or
tragical
accidents
or
of
tracking
criminals
who
have
baffled
all
the
detectives
hearing
their
talk
bartley
began
to
realize
that
journalism
might
be
a
very
different
thing
from
what
he
had
imagined
it
in
a
country
and
that
it
might
not
be
altogether
wise
to
consider
it
merely
as
a
to
the
law
with
the
american
eagerness
to
recognize
talent
numbers
of
good
fellows
spoke
to
him
about
his
logging
sketch
even
those
who
had
not
read
it
seemed
to
know
about
it
as
a
hit
they
were
all
delighted
to
be
able
to
say
ricker
tells
me
that
you
offered
it
to
old
witherby
and
he
look
at
it
he
found
that
this
fact
which
he
had
doubtfully
confided
to
ricker
was
not
offensive
to
some
of
the
events
people
who
were
there
one
of
them
got
him
aside
and
darkly
owned
to
him
that
witherby
was
doing
everything
that
any
one
man
could
to
kill
the
events
and
that
in
fact
the
was
running
the
paper
all
the
club
united
in
abusing
the
dinner
which
in
his
rustic
ignorance
bartley
had
not
found
so
infamous
but
they
ate
it
with
perfect
appetite
and
with
mounting
good
spirits
the
president
brewed
punch
in
a
great
bowl
before
him
and
rising
with
a
glass
of
it
in
his
hand
opened
a
free
parliament
of
speaking
and
singing
whoever
recollected
a
song
or
a
story
that
he
liked
called
upon
the
owner
of
it
to
sing
it
or
tell
it
and
it
appeared
not
to
matter
how
old
the
fun
or
the
music
was
the
company
was
resolved
to
be
happy
it
roared
and
clapped
till
the
glasses
rang
you
will
like
this
song
bartley
neighbors
to
right
and
left
of
him
prophesied
or
just
listen
to
this
story
of
mason
capital
as
one
or
another
rose
in
response
to
a
general
clamor
when
they
went
back
to
the
they
carried
the
with
them
and
there
amid
a
thick
cloud
of
smoke
two
clever
amateurs
took
their
places
at
the
piano
and
sang
and
played
to
their
heart
content
while
the
rest
glass
in
hand
talked
and
laughed
or
listened
as
they
chose
bartley
had
not
been
called
upon
but
he
was
burning
to
try
that
song
in
which
he
had
failed
so
dismally
in
the
when
the
pianist
rose
at
last
he
slipped
down
into
the
chair
and
striking
the
chords
of
the
accompaniment
he
gave
his
piece
with
brilliant
audacity
the
room
silenced
itself
and
then
burst
into
a
roar
of
applause
and
cries
of
encore
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
the
success
look
here
ricker
said
a
leading
man
at
the
end
of
the
repetition
your
friend
must
be
one
of
us
and
rapping
on
the
table
he
proposed
bartley
name
in
that
simple
time
the
club
voted
on
proposed
members
and
bartley
found
himself
elected
by
acclamation
and
in
the
act
of
paying
over
his
initiation
fee
to
the
treasurer
before
he
had
well
realized
the
honor
done
him
everybody
near
him
shook
his
hand
and
offered
to
be
of
service
to
him
much
of
this
cordiality
was
merely
collective
good
feeling
something
of
it
might
be
justly
attributed
to
the
punch
but
the
greater
part
was
honest
in
this
civilization
of
ours
grotesque
and
unequal
and
imperfect
as
it
is
in
many
things
we
are
bound
together
in
a
brotherly
sympathy
unknown
to
any
other
we
new
men
have
all
had
our
hard
rubs
but
we
do
not
so
much
remember
them
in
soreness
or
resentment
as
in
the
wish
to
help
forward
any
other
who
is
presently
feeling
them
if
he
will
but
help
himself
too
a
hundred
hands
are
stretched
out
to
him
bartley
had
kept
his
head
clear
of
the
punch
but
he
left
the
club
drunk
with
joy
and
pride
and
so
impatient
to
be
with
marcia
and
tell
her
of
his
triumphs
that
he
could
hardly
wait
to
read
the
proof
of
his
article
which
ricker
had
put
in
hand
at
once
for
the
sunday
edition
he
found
marcia
sitting
up
for
him
and
she
listened
with
a
shining
face
while
he
hastily
ran
over
the
most
flattering
facts
of
the
evening
she
was
not
so
much
surprised
at
the
honors
done
him
as
he
had
expected
but
she
was
happier
and
she
made
him
repeat
it
all
and
give
her
the
last
details
he
was
afraid
she
would
ask
him
what
his
initiation
had
cost
but
she
seemed
to
have
no
idea
that
it
had
cost
anything
and
though
it
had
swept
away
a
third
of
the
money
he
had
received
for
his
sketch
he
still
resolved
that
she
should
have
that
supper
at
parker
i
consider
my
future
made
he
said
aloud
at
the
end
of
his
swift
cogitation
on
this
point
oh
yes
she
responded
rapturously
we
need
have
a
moment
anxiety
but
we
must
be
very
saving
still
till
you
get
a
oh
certainly
said
bartley
xvii
during
several
months
that
followed
bartley
work
consisted
of
interviewing
of
special
reporting
in
all
its
branches
of
correspondence
by
mail
and
telegraph
from
points
to
which
he
was
sent
his
leisure
he
spent
in
studying
subjects
which
could
be
treated
like
that
of
the
marcia
entered
into
his
affairs
with
the
keen
which
characterizes
a
woman
participation
in
business
whatever
could
be
divined
she
was
quickly
mistress
of
she
vividly
sympathized
with
his
difficulties
and
his
triumphs
she
failed
to
follow
him
in
matters
of
political
detail
or
of
general
effect
she
could
not
be
dispassionate
or
impartial
his
relation
to
any
enterprise
was
always
more
important
than
anything
else
about
it
on
some
of
his
missions
he
took
her
with
him
and
then
they
made
it
a
pleasure
excursion
and
if
they
came
home
late
with
the
material
still
unwritten
she
helped
him
with
his
notes
wrote
from
his
dictation
and
enabled
him
to
give
a
fuller
report
than
his
rivals
she
caught
up
with
amusing
aptness
the
technical
terms
of
the
profession
and
was
voluble
about
getting
in
ahead
of
the
events
and
the
other
papers
and
she
was
indignant
if
any
part
of
his
report
was
cut
out
or
garbled
or
any
feature
was
spoiled
he
made
a
card
of
grouping
and
treating
with
picturesque
freshness
the
spring
openings
of
the
milliners
and
people
and
when
he
brought
his
article
to
ricker
the
editor
ran
it
over
and
said
guess
you
took
your
wife
with
you
yes
i
did
bartley
owned
he
was
always
proud
of
her
looks
and
it
flattered
him
that
ricker
should
see
the
evidences
of
her
feminine
taste
and
knowledge
in
his
account
of
the
bonnets
and
dress
goods
you
suppose
i
could
get
at
all
these
things
by
inspiration
do
you
marcia
was
already
known
to
some
of
his
friends
whom
he
had
introduced
to
her
in
casual
encounters
they
were
mostly
unmarried
or
if
married
they
lived
at
a
distance
and
they
did
not
visit
the
hubbards
at
their
lodgings
marcia
was
a
little
shy
and
did
not
quite
know
whether
they
ought
to
call
without
being
asked
or
whether
she
ought
to
ask
them
besides
was
not
always
at
her
disposal
and
she
would
not
have
liked
to
take
them
all
the
way
up
to
her
own
room
her
social
life
was
therefore
confined
to
the
public
places
where
she
met
these
friends
of
her
husband
they
sometimes
happened
together
at
a
restaurant
or
saw
one
another
between
the
acts
at
the
theatre
or
on
coming
out
of
a
concert
marcia
was
not
so
much
admired
for
her
conversation
by
her
acquaintance
as
for
her
beauty
and
her
style
a
rustic
reluctance
still
lingered
in
her
she
was
thin
and
dry
in
her
talk
with
any
one
but
bartley
and
she
could
not
help
letting
even
men
perceive
that
she
was
uneasy
when
they
interested
him
in
matters
foreign
to
her
bartley
did
not
see
why
they
could
not
have
some
of
these
fellows
up
in
their
room
for
tea
but
marcia
told
him
it
was
impossible
in
fact
although
she
willingly
lived
this
irregular
life
with
him
she
was
at
heart
not
at
all
a
bohemian
she
did
not
like
being
in
lodgings
or
dining
at
restaurants
on
their
excursions
into
the
suburbs
when
the
spring
opened
she
was
always
choosing
this
or
that
little
house
as
the
place
where
she
would
like
to
live
and
wondering
if
it
were
within
their
means
she
said
she
would
gladly
do
all
the
work
herself
she
hated
to
be
idle
so
much
as
she
now
must
the
city
novelty
wore
off
for
her
sooner
than
for
him
the
concerts
the
lectures
the
theatres
had
already
lost
their
zest
for
her
and
she
went
because
he
wished
her
to
go
or
in
order
to
be
able
to
help
him
with
what
he
was
always
writing
about
such
things
as
the
spring
advanced
bartley
conceived
the
plan
of
a
local
study
something
in
the
manner
of
the
article
but
on
a
much
vaster
scale
he
proposed
to
ricker
a
timely
series
on
the
easily
accessible
resorts
to
be
called
boston
and
to
relate
mainly
to
the
seaside
hotels
and
their
surroundings
his
idea
was
encouraged
and
he
took
marcia
with
him
on
most
of
his
expeditions
for
its
realization
these
were
largely
made
before
the
regular
season
had
well
begun
but
the
boats
were
already
running
and
the
hotels
were
open
and
they
were
treated
with
the
hospitality
which
a
knowledge
of
mission
must
invoke
as
he
said
it
was
a
matter
of
business
give
and
take
on
both
sides
and
the
landlords
took
more
than
they
gave
in
any
such
trade
on
her
part
marcia
regarded
as
a
just
and
legitimate
privilege
of
the
press
if
not
one
of
its
chief
attributes
and
these
passes
on
boats
and
trains
this
system
of
paying
by
the
presentation
of
a
card
constituted
distinguished
and
honorable
recognition
from
the
public
to
her
simple
experience
when
bartley
told
how
magnificently
the
reporters
had
been
accommodated
at
some
civic
or
commercial
or
professional
banquet
with
a
table
of
their
own
where
they
were
served
with
all
the
wines
and
courses
he
seemed
to
have
been
one
of
the
principal
guests
and
her
fear
was
that
his
head
should
be
turned
by
his
honors
but
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
though
she
enjoyed
the
brilliancy
of
bartley
present
life
she
did
not
think
his
occupation
comparable
to
the
law
in
dignity
bartley
called
himself
a
journalist
now
but
his
newspaper
connection
still
identified
him
in
her
mind
with
those
country
editors
of
whom
she
had
always
heard
her
father
speak
with
such
contempt
men
dedicated
to
poverty
and
the
despite
of
all
the
local
notables
who
used
them
she
could
not
shake
off
the
old
feeling
of
degradation
even
when
she
heard
bartley
and
some
of
his
talking
in
their
boastfulest
vein
of
the
sovereign
character
of
journalism
and
she
secretly
resolved
never
to
relinquish
her
purpose
of
having
him
a
lawyer
till
he
was
fairly
this
in
regular
and
prosperous
practice
she
knew
that
she
should
not
have
shown
her
father
that
she
was
right
in
marrying
bartley
in
the
mean
time
their
life
went
ignorantly
on
in
the
obscure
channels
where
their
isolation
from
society
kept
it
longer
than
was
natural
three
or
four
months
after
they
came
to
boston
they
were
still
country
people
with
scarcely
any
knowledge
of
the
distinctions
and
differences
so
important
to
the
various
worlds
of
any
city
so
far
from
knowing
that
they
must
not
walk
in
the
common
they
used
to
sit
down
on
a
bench
there
in
the
pleasant
weather
and
watch
the
opening
of
the
spring
among
the
lovers
whose
passion
had
a
publicity
that
neither
surprised
nor
shocked
them
after
they
were
a
little
more
enlightened
they
resorted
to
the
public
garden
where
they
admired
the
bridge
and
the
and
the
statues
bartley
who
was
already
beginning
to
get
up
a
taste
for
art
boldly
stopped
and
praised
the
venus
in
the
presence
of
the
gardeners
planting
they
went
sometimes
to
the
museum
of
fine
arts
where
they
found
a
pleasure
in
the
worst
things
which
the
best
never
afterwards
gave
them
and
where
she
became
as
hungry
and
tired
as
if
it
were
the
vatican
they
had
a
pride
in
taking
books
out
of
the
public
library
where
they
walked
about
on
tiptoe
with
bated
breath
and
they
thought
it
a
divine
treat
to
hear
the
great
organ
play
at
noon
as
they
sat
there
in
the
music
hall
and
let
the
mighty
instrument
bellow
over
their
strong
young
nerves
bartley
whispered
marcia
the
jokes
he
had
heard
about
the
organ
and
then
upon
the
wave
of
aristocratic
sensation
from
this
experience
they
went
out
and
dined
at
copeland
or
weber
or
fera
or
even
at
parker
they
had
long
since
forsaken
the
humble
restaurant
with
its
doilies
and
its
ponderous
crockery
and
they
had
so
mastered
the
art
of
ordering
that
they
could
manage
a
dinner
as
cheaply
at
these
finer
places
as
anywhere
especially
if
marcia
pretended
not
to
care
much
for
her
half
of
the
portion
and
connived
at
its
transfer
to
bartley
plate
in
his
hours
of
leisure
they
were
so
perpetually
together
that
it
became
a
joke
with
the
men
who
knew
them
to
say
when
asked
if
bartley
were
married
very
it
was
not
wholly
their
inseparableness
that
gave
the
impression
of
this
extreme
conjugality
as
i
said
marcia
uneasiness
when
others
interested
bartley
in
things
alien
to
her
made
itself
felt
even
by
these
men
she
struggled
against
it
because
she
did
not
wish
to
put
him
to
shame
before
them
and
often
with
an
aching
sense
of
desolation
she
sent
him
off
with
them
to
talk
apart
or
left
him
with
them
if
they
met
on
the
street
and
walked
home
alone
rather
than
let
any
one
say
that
she
kept
her
husband
tied
to
her
his
club
after
the
first
sense
of
its
splendor
and
usefulness
wore
away
was
an
ordeal
she
had
failed
to
conceal
that
she
thought
the
initiation
and
annual
fees
extravagant
she
knew
no
other
bliss
like
having
bartley
sit
down
in
their
own
room
with
her
it
did
not
matter
whether
they
talked
if
he
were
busy
she
would
as
lief
sit
and
sew
or
sit
and
silently
look
at
him
as
he
wrote
in
these
moments
she
liked
to
feign
that
she
had
lost
him
that
they
had
never
been
married
and
then
come
back
with
a
rush
of
joy
to
the
reality
but
on
his
club
nights
she
heroically
sent
him
off
and
spent
the
evening
with
nash
sometimes
she
went
out
by
day
with
the
landlady
who
had
a
passion
for
auctions
and
cemeteries
and
who
led
marcia
to
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
such
pleasures
at
mount
auburn
marcia
liked
the
marble
lambs
and
the
emblematic
hands
pointing
upward
with
the
dexter
finger
and
the
infants
carved
in
stone
and
the
angels
with
folded
wings
and
lifted
eyes
better
than
the
casts
which
bartley
said
were
from
the
antique
in
the
museum
on
this
side
her
mind
was
as
wholly
dormant
as
that
of
nash
herself
she
always
came
home
feeling
as
if
she
had
not
seen
bartley
for
a
year
and
fearful
that
something
had
happened
to
him
the
hardest
thing
about
their
irregular
life
was
that
he
must
sometimes
be
gone
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
when
he
could
not
take
her
with
him
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
not
draw
a
full
breath
in
his
absence
and
once
he
found
her
almost
wild
on
his
return
she
had
begun
to
fancy
that
he
was
never
coming
back
again
he
laughed
at
her
when
she
betrayed
her
secret
but
she
was
not
ashamed
and
when
he
asked
her
well
what
if
i
had
come
back
she
answered
passionately
it
would
have
made
much
difference
to
me
i
should
not
have
the
uncertainty
of
his
income
was
another
cause
of
anguish
to
her
at
times
he
earned
forty
or
fifty
dollars
a
week
oftener
he
earned
ten
there
was
now
and
then
a
week
when
everything
that
he
put
his
hand
to
failed
and
he
earned
nothing
at
all
then
marcia
despaired
her
frugality
became
a
mania
and
they
had
quarrels
about
what
she
called
his
extravagance
she
embittered
his
daily
bread
by
blaming
him
for
what
he
spent
on
it
she
wore
her
oldest
dresses
and
would
have
had
him
go
shabby
in
token
of
their
adversity
her
economies
were
frantic
child
play
methodless
inexperienced
fitful
and
they
were
apt
to
be
followed
by
remorse
in
which
she
abetted
him
in
some
wanton
excess
the
future
of
any
heroic
action
is
difficult
to
manage
and
the
sublime
sacrifice
of
her
pride
and
all
the
conventional
proprieties
which
marcia
had
made
in
giving
herself
to
bartley
was
inevitably
tried
by
the
same
sordid
tests
that
every
married
life
is
put
to
that
salaried
place
which
he
was
always
seeking
on
the
staff
of
some
newspaper
proved
not
so
easy
to
get
as
he
had
imagined
in
the
flush
of
his
first
successes
ricker
willingly
included
him
among
the
own
correspondents
and
special
reporters
and
he
held
the
same
relation
to
several
other
papers
but
he
remained
without
a
more
definite
position
he
earned
perhaps
more
money
than
a
salary
would
have
given
him
and
in
their
way
of
living
he
and
marcia
laid
up
something
out
of
what
he
earned
but
it
did
not
seem
to
her
that
he
exerted
himself
to
get
a
salaried
place
she
was
sure
that
if
so
many
others
who
could
not
write
half
so
well
had
places
he
might
get
one
if
he
only
kept
trying
bartley
laughed
at
these
of
marcia
as
he
called
them
but
sometimes
they
enraged
him
and
he
had
days
of
sullen
resentment
when
he
resisted
all
her
advances
towards
reconciliation
but
he
kept
hard
at
work
and
he
always
owned
at
last
how
disinterested
her
most
ridiculous
alarm
had
been
once
when
they
had
been
talking
as
usual
about
that
permanent
place
on
some
newspaper
she
said
but
i
should
only
want
that
to
be
temporary
if
you
got
it
i
want
you
should
go
on
with
the
law
bartley
i
been
thinking
about
that
i
do
want
you
should
always
be
a
bartley
smiled
what
could
i
do
for
a
living
i
should
like
to
know
while
i
was
studying
law
you
could
do
some
newspaper
work
enough
to
support
us
while
you
were
studying
you
said
when
we
first
came
to
boston
that
you
should
settle
down
to
the
i
had
got
my
eyes
open
then
i
got
a
good
deal
longer
row
to
hoe
than
i
supposed
before
i
can
settle
down
to
the
father
said
you
did
need
to
study
but
a
little
not
if
i
were
going
into
the
practice
at
equity
but
it
a
very
different
thing
i
can
tell
you
in
boston
i
should
have
to
go
in
for
a
course
in
the
harvard
law
school
just
for
a
little
marcia
was
silenced
but
she
asked
after
a
moment
then
you
going
to
give
up
the
law
altogether
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
i
going
to
do
the
best
i
can
for
the
present
and
trust
to
luck
i
do
like
special
reporting
for
a
finality
but
i
should
like
shystering
what
shystering
asked
marcia
it
pettifogging
in
the
city
courts
wait
till
i
can
get
my
basis
till
i
have
a
fixed
amount
of
money
for
a
fixed
amount
of
work
and
then
talk
to
you
about
taking
up
the
law
again
i
willing
to
do
it
whenever
it
seems
the
right
thing
i
guess
i
should
like
it
though
i
do
see
why
it
any
better
than
journalism
and
i
do
believe
it
has
any
more
but
you
been
a
long
time
trying
to
get
your
basis
on
a
newspaper
she
reasoned
why
do
you
try
to
get
it
in
some
other
way
why
do
you
try
to
get
a
clerk
place
with
some
lawyer
well
suppose
i
was
willing
to
starve
along
in
that
way
how
should
i
go
about
to
get
such
a
place
demanded
bartley
with
impatience
why
do
you
go
to
that
halleck
you
visited
here
you
used
to
tell
me
he
was
going
to
be
a
well
if
you
remember
so
distinctly
what
i
said
about
going
into
the
law
when
i
first
came
to
boston
said
her
husband
angrily
perhaps
remember
that
i
said
i
should
go
to
halleck
until
i
did
need
his
help
i
shall
not
go
to
him
his
marcia
gave
way
to
spiteful
tears
it
seems
as
if
you
were
ashamed
to
let
them
know
that
you
were
in
town
are
you
afraid
i
shall
want
to
get
acquainted
with
them
do
you
suppose
i
shall
want
to
go
to
their
parties
and
disgrace
you
bartley
took
his
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
and
looked
blackly
at
her
so
that
what
you
been
thinking
is
it
she
threw
herself
upon
his
neck
no
no
it
is
she
cried
hysterically
you
know
that
i
never
thought
it
till
this
instant
you
know
i
did
think
it
at
all
i
just
it
my
nerves
are
all
gone
i
know
i
saying
half
the
time
and
you
as
strict
with
me
as
if
i
were
as
well
as
ever
i
may
as
well
take
off
my
things
i
not
well
enough
to
go
with
you
she
had
been
dressing
while
they
talked
for
an
entertainment
which
bartley
was
going
to
report
for
the
and
now
she
made
a
feint
of
wishing
to
remove
her
hat
he
would
not
let
her
he
said
that
if
she
did
not
go
he
should
not
he
reproached
her
with
not
wishing
to
go
with
him
any
more
he
coaxed
her
laughingly
and
fondly
it
only
because
i
not
so
strong
now
she
said
in
a
whisper
that
ended
in
a
kiss
on
his
cheek
you
must
walk
very
slowly
and
not
hurry
the
entertainment
was
to
be
given
in
aid
of
the
indigent
society
and
it
was
at
the
end
of
june
rather
late
in
the
season
but
the
society
itself
was
an
afterthought
not
conceived
till
a
great
many
people
had
left
town
on
whose
assistance
such
a
charity
must
largely
depend
strenuous
appeals
had
been
made
however
it
was
represented
that
ten
thousand
poor
children
could
be
transported
to
nantasket
beach
and
there
as
one
of
the
ladies
on
the
committee
said
bathed
and
lemonaded
three
times
during
the
summer
at
a
cost
so
small
that
it
was
a
saving
to
spend
the
money
class
day
falling
about
the
same
time
many
exiles
at
newport
and
on
the
north
shore
came
up
and
down
and
the
affair
promised
to
be
one
of
social
distinction
if
not
pecuniary
success
the
entertainment
was
to
be
varied
a
distinguished
poet
was
to
read
an
old
poem
of
his
and
a
distinguished
poetess
was
to
read
a
new
poem
of
hers
some
professional
people
were
to
follow
with
comic
singing
an
elocutionist
was
to
give
impressions
of
noted
public
speakers
and
a
number
of
vocal
and
instrumental
amateurs
were
to
contribute
their
talent
bartley
had
instructions
from
ricker
to
see
that
his
report
was
very
full
socially
we
want
something
lively
and
at
the
same
time
nice
and
tasteful
about
the
whole
thing
and
i
guess
you
the
man
to
do
it
get
hubbard
to
go
with
you
and
keep
you
from
making
a
fool
of
yourself
about
the
he
gave
bartley
two
tickets
mighty
hard
to
get
i
can
tell
you
for
or
money
especially
love
he
said
and
bartley
made
much
of
this
difficulty
in
impressing
marcia
imagination
with
the
uncommon
character
of
the
occasion
she
had
put
on
a
new
dress
which
she
had
just
finished
for
herself
and
which
was
a
marvel
not
only
of
cheapness
but
of
elegance
she
had
plagiarized
the
idea
from
the
costume
of
a
lady
with
whom
she
stopped
to
look
in
at
a
milliner
window
where
she
formed
the
notion
of
her
bonnet
but
marcia
had
imagined
the
things
anew
in
relation
to
herself
and
made
them
her
own
when
bartley
first
saw
her
in
them
though
he
had
witnessed
their
growth
from
the
germ
he
said
that
he
was
afraid
of
her
she
was
so
splendid
and
he
did
not
quite
know
whether
he
felt
acquainted
when
they
were
seated
at
the
concert
and
had
time
to
look
about
them
he
whispered
well
marsh
i
do
see
anything
here
that
comes
near
you
in
style
and
she
flung
a
little
corner
of
her
drapery
out
over
his
hand
so
that
she
could
squeeze
it
she
was
quite
happy
again
after
the
concert
bartley
left
her
for
a
moment
and
went
up
to
a
group
of
the
committee
near
the
platform
to
get
some
points
for
his
report
he
spoke
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
and
pencil
in
hand
and
the
gentleman
referred
him
to
one
of
the
ladies
of
the
committee
who
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
demanded
in
a
rich
tone
of
injury
and
surprise
why
is
this
hubbard
and
indignantly
answering
herself
of
it
is
gave
her
hand
with
a
sort
of
dramatic
cordiality
and
flooded
him
with
questions
when
did
you
come
to
boston
are
you
at
the
hallecks
did
you
come
or
no
you
harvard
you
not
in
boston
and
what
in
the
world
are
getting
items
for
hubbard
she
introduced
him
in
a
breathless
climax
to
the
gentleman
to
whom
he
had
first
spoken
and
who
had
listened
to
her
attack
on
bartley
with
a
smile
which
he
was
at
no
trouble
to
hide
from
her
which
question
are
you
going
to
answer
first
hubbard
he
asked
quietly
while
his
eyes
searched
bartley
for
an
instant
with
inquiry
which
was
at
once
kind
and
keen
his
face
had
the
distinction
which
comes
of
being
in
our
bearded
times
oh
the
last
said
bartley
i
reporting
the
concert
for
the
and
i
want
to
interview
some
one
in
authority
about
then
interview
hubbard
cried
the
young
lady
in
authority
about
this
affair
it
my
own
invention
as
the
white
knight
says
and
then
i
interview
you
afterwards
and
you
gone
into
journalism
like
all
the
harvard
men
so
glad
it
you
for
you
can
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
the
cause
if
you
will
the
entertainment
has
given
us
all
the
money
we
shall
want
by
any
means
and
we
shall
need
all
the
help
the
press
can
give
us
ask
me
any
questions
you
please
hubbard
there
is
a
soul
here
that
i
would
sacrifice
to
the
last
personal
particular
if
the
press
will
only
do
its
duty
in
return
you
no
idea
how
we
been
working
during
the
last
fortnight
since
this
old
man
of
the
sprang
upon
us
i
was
sitting
quietly
at
home
thinking
of
anything
else
in
the
world
i
can
assure
you
when
the
atrocious
idea
occurred
to
she
ran
on
to
give
a
full
sketch
of
the
inception
and
history
of
the
scheme
up
to
the
present
time
suddenly
she
arrested
herself
and
bartley
flying
pencil
why
you
not
putting
all
that
nonsense
down
certainly
i
am
said
bartley
while
atherton
with
a
laugh
turned
and
walked
away
to
talk
with
some
other
ladies
it
the
very
thing
i
want
i
shall
get
in
ahead
of
all
the
other
papers
on
this
they
had
anything
like
it
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
horror
then
well
go
on
i
would
do
anything
for
the
cause
she
cried
tell
me
who
been
here
then
said
bartley
she
recoiled
a
little
i
do
like
giving
but
i
ca
say
who
the
people
were
unless
you
that
true
said
the
young
lady
thoughtfully
she
prided
herself
on
her
thoughtfulness
which
sometimes
came
before
and
sometimes
after
the
fact
you
not
obliged
to
say
who
told
you
of
course
she
ran
over
a
list
of
historical
and
distinguished
names
and
he
slyly
asked
if
this
and
that
lady
were
not
dressed
so
and
so
and
worked
in
the
costumes
from
her
unconsciously
elaborate
answers
she
was
afterwards
astonished
that
he
should
have
known
what
people
had
on
lastly
he
asked
what
the
committee
expected
to
do
next
and
was
enabled
to
enrich
his
report
with
many
authoritative
expressions
and
intimations
the
lady
became
all
zeal
in
these
confidences
to
the
public
at
last
she
told
everything
she
knew
and
a
great
deal
that
she
merely
hoped
and
now
come
into
the
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee
i
know
you
must
be
faint
with
all
this
talking
she
concluded
i
want
to
ask
you
something
about
she
was
not
older
than
bartley
but
she
addressed
him
with
the
freedom
we
use
in
encouraging
younger
people
thank
you
he
said
coolly
i
ca
very
well
i
must
go
back
to
my
wife
and
hurry
up
this
oh
is
hubbard
here
asked
the
young
lady
with
surprise
present
me
to
her
she
cried
with
that
fearlessness
of
social
consequences
for
which
she
was
noted
she
believed
there
were
ways
of
getting
rid
of
undesirable
people
without
treating
them
rudely
the
audience
had
got
out
of
the
hall
and
marcia
stood
alone
near
one
of
the
doors
waiting
for
bartley
he
glanced
proudly
toward
her
and
said
i
shall
be
very
miss
kingsbury
drifted
by
his
side
across
the
intervening
space
and
was
ready
to
take
marcia
impressively
by
the
hand
when
she
reached
her
she
had
promptly
decided
her
to
be
very
beautiful
and
elegantly
simple
in
dress
but
she
found
her
smaller
than
she
had
looked
at
a
distance
miss
kingsbury
was
herself
rather
large
sometimes
she
thought
rather
too
large
certainly
too
large
if
she
had
not
had
such
perfect
command
of
every
inch
of
herself
in
complexion
she
was
richly
blonde
with
beautiful
fair
hair
roughed
over
her
forehead
as
if
by
a
breeze
and
apt
to
escape
in
sunny
tendrils
over
the
peachy
tints
of
her
temples
her
features
were
massive
rather
than
fine
and
though
she
thoroughly
admired
her
chin
and
respected
her
mouth
she
had
doubts
about
her
nose
which
she
frankly
referred
to
friends
for
solution
had
it
not
much
of
a
knob
at
the
end
she
seemed
to
tower
over
marcia
as
she
took
her
hand
at
bartley
introduction
and
expressed
her
pleasure
at
meeting
her
i
do
know
why
it
need
be
such
a
surprise
to
find
one
gentlemen
friends
married
but
it
always
is
somehow
i
do
think
hubbard
would
have
known
me
if
i
had
insisted
upon
his
recognizing
me
i
ca
blame
him
it
three
years
since
we
met
do
you
help
him
with
his
reports
i
know
you
do
you
make
him
lenient
to
our
entertainment
the
cause
is
so
good
how
long
have
you
been
in
boston
though
i
do
know
why
i
should
ask
that
you
may
have
always
been
in
boston
one
used
to
know
everybody
but
the
place
so
large
now
i
should
like
to
come
and
see
you
but
i
going
out
of
town
for
the
summer
i
not
really
here
now
except
i
ought
to
have
been
away
weeks
ago
but
this
indigent
has
kept
me
you
no
idea
what
such
an
undertaking
is
but
you
let
me
have
your
address
and
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
town
in
the
fall
i
shall
insist
upon
looking
you
up
by
i
must
run
away
now
and
leave
you
there
are
a
thousand
things
for
me
to
look
after
yet
she
took
marcia
again
by
the
hand
and
superadded
some
bows
and
nods
and
smiles
of
parting
after
she
released
her
but
she
did
not
ask
her
to
come
into
the
and
have
some
coffee
and
bartley
took
his
wife
hand
under
his
arm
and
went
out
of
the
hall
well
he
said
with
a
man
simple
pleasure
in
miss
friendliness
to
his
wife
that
the
girl
i
used
to
tell
you
about
the
rich
one
with
the
money
in
her
own
right
whom
i
met
at
the
hallecks
she
seemed
to
think
you
were
about
the
thing
marsh
i
saw
her
eyes
open
as
she
came
up
and
i
felt
awfully
proud
of
you
you
never
looked
half
so
well
but
why
did
you
something
she
did
give
me
any
chance
said
marcia
and
i
had
nothing
to
say
anyway
i
thought
she
was
very
disagreeable
repeated
bartley
in
amaze
miss
kingsbury
went
back
to
the
where
one
of
the
amateurs
had
been
lecturing
upon
her
clara
kingsbury
can
say
and
do
from
the
best
heart
in
the
world
more
offensive
things
in
ten
minutes
than
malice
could
invent
in
a
week
somebody
ought
to
go
out
and
drag
her
away
from
that
reporter
by
main
force
but
i
presume
it
too
late
already
she
had
time
to
destroy
us
all
you
see
that
there
wo
be
a
shred
left
of
us
in
paper
at
any
rate
really
i
wonder
that
in
a
city
full
of
nervous
and
exasperated
people
like
boston
clara
kingsbury
has
been
suffered
to
live
she
throws
her
whole
soul
into
everything
she
undertakes
and
she
has
gone
so
into
this
indigent
bathing
and
splashed
about
in
it
so
that
ca
understand
how
we
got
anybody
to
come
why
i
the
least
doubt
that
she
offered
that
poor
man
a
ticket
to
go
down
to
nantasket
and
bathe
with
the
other
indigents
she
treated
as
if
i
ought
to
be
personally
for
the
last
fortnight
and
if
any
chance
for
us
left
by
her
tactlessness
you
may
be
sure
she
gone
at
it
with
her
conscience
and
simply
swept
it
off
the
face
of
the
xviii
one
hot
day
in
august
when
bartley
had
been
doing
nothing
for
a
week
and
marcia
was
gloomily
forecasting
the
future
when
they
would
have
to
begin
living
upon
the
money
they
had
put
into
the
savings
bank
she
reverted
to
the
question
of
his
taking
up
the
law
again
she
was
apt
to
recur
to
this
in
any
moment
of
discouragement
and
she
urged
him
now
to
give
up
his
newspaper
work
with
that
wearisome
persistence
with
which
women
torment
the
men
they
love
my
newspaper
work
seems
to
have
given
me
up
my
dear
said
bartley
like
asking
a
fellow
not
to
marry
a
girl
that
wo
have
he
laughed
and
then
whistled
and
marcia
burst
into
fretful
futile
tears
which
he
did
not
attempt
to
assuage
they
had
been
all
summer
in
town
the
country
would
have
been
no
change
to
them
and
they
knew
nothing
of
the
seaside
except
the
crowded
noisy
expensive
resorts
near
the
city
bartley
wished
her
to
go
to
one
of
these
for
a
week
or
two
at
any
rate
but
she
would
not
and
in
fact
neither
of
them
had
the
born
citizen
conception
of
the
value
of
a
summer
vacation
but
they
had
found
their
attic
intolerable
and
the
single
gentlemen
having
all
given
up
their
rooms
by
this
time
nash
let
marcia
have
one
lower
down
where
they
sat
looking
out
on
the
hot
street
well
cried
marcia
at
last
you
do
care
for
my
feelings
or
you
would
take
up
the
law
her
husband
rose
with
a
sigh
that
was
half
a
curse
and
went
out
after
what
she
had
said
he
would
not
give
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
what
he
meant
to
do
but
he
had
it
in
his
head
to
go
to
that
atherton
to
whom
miss
kingsbury
had
introduced
him
and
ask
his
advice
he
had
found
out
that
atherton
was
a
lawyer
and
he
believed
that
he
would
tell
him
what
to
do
he
could
at
least
give
him
some
authoritative
discouragement
which
he
might
use
in
these
discussions
with
marcia
atherton
had
his
office
in
the
events
building
and
bartley
was
on
his
way
thither
when
he
met
ricker
seen
witherby
asked
his
friend
he
was
round
looking
for
what
does
witherby
want
with
me
asked
bartley
with
a
certain
resentment
wants
to
give
you
the
of
the
events
said
ricker
jocosely
pshaw
well
he
knows
where
to
find
me
if
he
wants
me
very
perhaps
he
does
suggested
ricker
in
that
case
you
better
look
him
why
you
do
advise
oh
do
advise
anything
but
if
can
let
bygones
be
bygones
i
guess
can
afford
to
i
do
know
just
what
he
wants
with
you
but
if
he
offers
you
anything
like
a
basis
you
better
take
bartley
basis
had
come
to
be
a
sort
of
between
them
ricker
usually
met
him
with
some
such
demand
as
well
what
about
the
basis
or
how
your
poor
basis
bartley
ardor
for
a
salaried
position
amused
him
and
he
often
tried
to
argue
him
out
of
it
you
much
better
off
as
a
free
lance
you
make
as
much
money
as
most
of
the
fellows
in
places
and
you
lead
a
pleasanter
life
if
you
were
on
any
one
paper
you
have
to
be
on
duty
about
fifteen
hours
out
of
the
you
be
out
every
night
till
three
or
four
you
have
to
do
fires
and
murders
and
all
sorts
of
police
business
and
now
you
work
mostly
on
fancy
jobs
something
you
suggest
yourself
or
something
you
specially
asked
to
do
that
a
kind
of
a
compliment
and
it
gives
you
nevertheless
if
bartley
had
his
heart
set
upon
a
basis
ricker
wanted
him
to
have
it
of
course
he
said
i
was
only
joking
about
the
basis
but
if
witherby
should
have
something
permanent
to
offer
do
quarrel
with
your
bread
and
butter
and
do
hold
yourself
cheap
going
to
get
all
he
can
for
as
little
as
he
can
every
ricker
was
a
newspaper
man
in
every
breath
his
great
interest
in
life
was
the
which
paid
him
poorly
and
worked
him
hard
to
get
in
ahead
of
the
other
papers
was
the
object
for
which
he
toiled
with
unremitting
zeal
but
after
that
he
liked
to
see
a
good
fellow
prosper
and
he
had
for
bartley
that
feeling
of
comradery
which
comes
out
among
journalists
when
their
rivalries
are
off
he
would
hate
to
lose
bartley
from
the
if
witherby
meant
business
bartley
and
he
might
be
excoriating
each
other
before
a
week
passed
in
sarcastic
references
to
our
esteemed
contemporary
of
the
events
and
our
esteemed
contemporary
of
the
but
he
heartily
wished
him
luck
and
hoped
it
might
be
some
sort
of
inside
work
when
ricker
left
him
bartley
hesitated
he
was
half
minded
to
go
home
and
wait
for
witherby
to
look
him
up
as
the
most
dignified
and
perhaps
the
most
prudent
course
but
he
was
curious
and
impatient
and
he
was
afraid
of
letting
the
chance
whatever
it
might
be
slip
through
his
fingers
he
suddenly
resolved
upon
a
little
ruse
which
would
still
oblige
witherby
to
make
the
advance
and
yet
would
risk
nothing
by
delay
he
mounted
to
witherby
room
in
the
events
building
and
pushed
open
the
door
then
he
drew
back
embarrassed
as
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
excuse
me
he
said
is
atherton
office
on
this
floor
witherby
looked
up
from
the
papers
on
his
desk
and
cleared
his
throat
when
he
overreached
himself
he
was
apt
to
hold
any
party
to
the
transaction
accountable
for
his
error
ever
since
he
refused
bartley
paper
on
the
he
had
accused
him
in
his
heart
of
fraud
because
he
had
sold
the
rejected
sketch
to
another
paper
and
anticipated
witherby
tardy
enterprise
in
the
same
direction
each
little
success
that
bartley
made
added
to
witherby
dislike
and
whilst
bartley
had
written
for
all
the
other
papers
he
had
never
got
any
work
from
the
events
witherby
had
the
guilty
sense
of
having
hated
him
as
he
looked
up
and
bartley
on
his
part
was
uneasily
sensible
of
some
mocking
paragraphs
of
a
more
or
less
personal
cast
which
he
had
written
in
the
about
the
enterprise
of
the
events
mr
atherton
is
on
the
floor
above
said
witherby
but
i
very
glad
you
happened
to
look
in
hubbard
i
i
was
just
thinking
about
you
ah
wont
you
take
a
chair
thanks
said
bartley
but
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
which
the
other
rose
to
offer
him
witherby
fumbled
about
among
the
things
on
his
desk
before
he
resumed
his
own
seat
i
hope
you
have
been
well
since
i
saw
you
oh
yes
i
always
well
how
have
you
been
bartley
wondered
whither
this
exchange
of
civilities
tended
but
he
believed
he
could
keep
it
up
as
long
as
old
witherby
could
why
i
have
not
been
very
well
said
witherby
getting
into
his
chair
and
taking
up
a
to
help
him
in
talk
the
fact
is
i
find
that
i
have
been
working
too
hard
i
have
undertaken
to
manage
the
editorial
department
of
the
events
in
addition
to
looking
after
its
business
and
the
care
has
been
too
great
it
has
told
upon
me
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
not
allowed
either
department
to
suffer
he
referred
this
point
so
directly
to
him
that
bartley
made
a
murmur
of
assent
and
witherby
resumed
but
the
care
has
told
upon
me
i
am
not
so
well
as
i
could
wish
i
need
rest
and
i
need
help
he
added
bartley
had
by
this
time
made
up
his
mind
that
if
witherby
had
anything
to
say
to
him
he
should
say
it
unaided
witherby
put
down
the
and
gave
his
attention
for
a
moment
to
a
i
do
know
whether
you
have
heard
that
clayton
is
going
to
leave
us
no
bartley
said
i
had
heard
yes
he
is
going
to
leave
us
clayton
and
i
have
not
agreed
upon
some
points
and
we
have
both
judged
it
best
that
we
should
witherby
paused
again
and
changed
the
positions
of
his
inkstand
and
mr
clayton
has
failed
me
as
i
may
say
at
the
last
moment
and
we
have
been
compelled
to
part
i
found
clayton
he
looked
again
at
bartley
who
said
yes
yes
i
found
clayton
so
much
at
variance
in
his
views
with
with
my
own
views
that
i
could
do
nothing
with
him
he
has
used
language
to
me
which
i
am
sure
he
will
regret
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
is
going
i
have
had
my
eye
on
you
hubbard
ever
since
you
came
to
boston
and
have
watched
your
career
with
interest
but
i
thought
of
clayton
in
the
first
instance
because
he
was
already
attached
to
the
events
and
i
wished
to
promote
him
office
during
good
behavior
and
promotion
in
the
direct
line
i
much
of
a
reformer
said
witherby
certainly
said
bartley
but
of
course
my
idea
in
starting
the
events
was
to
make
of
i
hold
that
the
first
duty
of
a
public
journal
is
to
make
money
for
the
owner
all
the
rest
follows
you
quite
right
witherby
said
bartley
unless
it
makes
money
there
can
be
no
enterprise
about
it
no
independence
nothing
that
was
the
way
i
did
with
my
little
paper
down
in
maine
the
first
thing
i
told
the
committee
when
i
took
hold
of
the
paper
is
to
keep
it
from
losing
money
the
next
is
to
make
money
with
it
first
peaceable
then
pure
that
what
i
told
precisely
so
witherby
was
now
so
much
at
his
ease
with
bartley
that
he
left
off
tormenting
the
things
on
his
desk
and
used
his
hands
in
gesticulating
look
at
the
churches
themselves
no
church
can
do
any
good
till
it
on
a
paying
basis
as
long
as
a
church
is
in
debt
it
secure
the
best
talent
for
the
pulpit
or
the
choir
and
the
members
go
about
feeling
discouraged
and
out
of
heart
it
just
so
with
a
newspaper
i
say
that
a
paper
does
no
good
till
it
pays
it
has
no
influence
its
motives
are
always
suspected
and
you
got
to
make
it
pay
by
hook
or
by
crook
before
you
can
hope
to
to
forward
any
good
cause
by
it
what
say
of
course
he
added
in
a
large
smooth
way
i
not
going
to
contend
that
a
newspaper
should
be
run
in
the
interest
of
the
not
at
all
but
i
do
contend
that
when
the
protests
against
a
certain
course
the
editorial
room
is
taking
it
ought
to
be
respectfully
listened
to
there
are
always
two
sides
to
every
question
suppose
all
the
newspapers
pitch
in
as
they
sometimes
do
and
denounce
a
certain
public
enterprise
a
projected
scheme
of
railroad
legislation
or
a
peculiar
system
of
banking
or
a
mining
interest
and
the
sends
up
word
that
the
company
advertises
heavily
with
us
shall
go
and
join
indiscriminately
in
that
hue
and
cry
or
shall
we
give
our
friends
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
answered
bartley
that
what
i
and
so
would
any
other
practical
man
said
witherby
and
that
just
where
clayton
and
i
differed
well
i
need
allude
to
him
any
more
he
added
leniently
what
i
wish
to
say
is
this
hubbard
i
am
overworked
and
i
feel
the
need
of
some
sort
of
relief
i
know
that
i
have
started
the
events
in
the
right
line
at
last
the
only
line
in
which
it
can
be
made
a
great
useful
and
respectable
journal
efficient
in
every
good
cause
and
what
i
want
now
is
some
sort
of
assistant
in
the
management
who
shall
be
in
full
sympathy
with
my
own
ideas
i
do
want
a
mere
slave
a
tool
but
i
do
want
an
independent
man
who
shall
be
with
me
for
the
success
of
the
paper
the
whole
time
and
every
time
and
shall
not
be
continually
setting
up
his
will
against
mine
on
all
sorts
of
points
that
was
the
trouble
with
clayton
i
have
nothing
against
clayton
personally
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
in
very
many
respects
but
he
was
all
wrong
about
journalism
all
wrong
hubbard
i
talked
with
him
a
great
deal
and
tried
to
make
him
see
where
his
interest
lay
he
had
been
on
the
paper
as
a
reporter
from
the
start
and
i
wished
very
much
to
promote
him
to
this
position
which
he
could
have
made
the
best
position
in
the
country
the
events
is
an
evening
paper
there
is
no
and
the
whole
thing
is
already
thoroughly
systematized
clayton
had
plenty
of
talent
and
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
step
in
under
my
direction
and
put
his
hand
on
the
helm
but
no
i
should
have
been
glad
to
keep
him
in
a
subordinate
capacity
but
i
had
to
let
him
go
he
said
that
he
would
not
report
the
conflagration
of
a
for
a
paper
conducted
on
the
principles
i
had
developed
to
him
now
that
is
no
way
to
talk
it
bartley
laughed
his
rich
caressing
laugh
in
which
there
was
the
insinuation
of
all
contempt
for
clayton
and
all
sympathy
with
witherby
it
made
witherby
feel
good
better
perhaps
than
he
had
felt
at
any
time
since
his
talk
with
clayton
well
now
what
do
you
say
hubbard
ca
we
make
some
arrangement
with
you
he
asked
with
a
burst
of
frankness
i
guess
you
can
said
bartley
the
fact
that
witherby
needed
him
was
so
plain
that
he
did
not
care
to
practise
any
finesse
about
the
matter
what
are
your
present
engagements
i
have
then
you
can
take
hold
at
once
that
good
witherby
now
entered
at
large
into
the
nature
of
the
position
which
he
offered
bartley
they
talked
a
long
time
and
in
becoming
better
acquainted
with
each
other
views
as
they
called
them
they
became
better
friends
bartley
began
to
respect
witherby
business
ideas
and
witherby
in
recognizing
all
the
admirable
qualities
of
this
and
young
man
began
to
feel
that
he
had
secretly
liked
him
from
the
first
and
had
only
waited
a
suitable
occasion
to
unmask
his
affection
it
was
arranged
that
bartley
should
come
on
as
assistant
and
should
do
whatever
he
was
asked
to
do
in
the
management
of
the
paper
he
was
to
write
on
topics
as
they
occurred
to
him
or
as
they
were
suggested
to
him
i
do
say
whether
this
will
lead
to
anything
more
hubbard
or
not
but
i
do
say
that
you
will
be
in
the
direct
line
of
yes
i
understand
that
said
bartley
and
now
as
to
terms
continued
witherby
a
little
tremulously
and
now
as
to
terms
repeated
bartley
to
himself
but
he
said
nothing
aloud
he
felt
that
witherby
had
cut
out
a
great
deal
of
work
for
him
and
work
of
a
kind
that
he
could
not
easily
find
another
man
both
willing
and
able
to
do
he
resolved
that
he
would
have
all
that
his
service
was
worth
what
should
you
think
of
twenty
dollars
a
week
asked
witherby
i
should
think
it
was
enough
said
bartley
amazed
at
his
own
audacity
but
enjoying
it
and
thinking
how
he
had
left
marcia
with
the
intention
of
offering
himself
to
atherton
as
a
clerk
for
ten
dollars
a
week
there
is
a
great
deal
of
labor
in
what
you
propose
and
you
command
my
whole
time
you
would
not
like
to
have
me
do
any
work
outside
of
the
no
witherby
assented
would
be
nearer
the
mark
he
inquired
soberly
it
would
be
nearer
certainly
said
bartley
but
i
guess
you
had
better
make
it
he
kept
a
quiet
face
but
his
heart
throbbed
well
say
thirty
then
replied
witherby
so
promptly
that
bartley
perceived
with
a
pang
that
he
might
as
easily
have
got
forty
from
him
but
it
was
now
too
late
and
a
salary
of
fifteen
hundred
a
year
passed
the
wildest
hopes
he
had
cherished
half
an
hour
before
all
right
he
said
quietly
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
take
hold
at
once
yes
on
monday
oh
by
the
way
said
witherby
there
is
one
little
piece
of
outside
work
which
i
should
like
you
to
finish
up
for
us
and
agree
upon
something
extra
for
it
if
you
wish
i
mean
our
solid
men
series
i
do
know
whether
you
noticed
the
series
in
the
events
yes
said
bartley
i
well
then
you
know
what
they
are
they
consist
of
interviews
guarded
and
inoffensive
as
respects
the
sanctity
of
private
life
with
our
leading
manufacturers
and
merchant
princes
at
their
places
of
business
and
their
residences
and
include
a
description
of
these
and
some
account
of
the
lives
of
the
different
yes
i
have
seen
them
said
bartley
i
noticed
the
general
you
know
that
clayton
has
been
doing
them
he
made
them
a
popular
feature
the
parties
themselves
were
very
much
pleased
with
oh
people
are
always
tickled
to
be
interviewed
said
bartley
i
know
they
put
on
airs
about
it
and
go
round
complaining
to
each
other
about
the
violation
of
confidence
and
so
on
but
they
all
like
it
you
know
i
reported
that
indigent
entertainment
in
june
for
the
i
knew
the
lady
who
got
it
up
and
i
interviewed
her
after
the
miss
kingsbury
witherby
made
an
inarticulate
murmur
of
respect
for
bartley
in
his
throat
and
involuntarily
changed
toward
him
but
not
so
subtly
that
bartley
finer
instinct
did
not
take
note
of
the
change
she
was
a
fresh
subject
and
she
told
me
everything
of
course
i
printed
it
all
she
was
awfully
shocked
or
pretended
to
be
and
wrote
me
a
very
note
about
it
but
i
went
round
to
the
office
the
next
day
and
i
found
that
nearly
every
lady
mentioned
in
the
interview
had
ordered
half
a
dozen
copies
of
that
issue
sent
to
her
seaside
address
and
the
office
had
been
full
of
beacon
street
swells
all
the
morning
buying
one
with
the
report
of
the
concert
in
it
these
low
views
of
high
society
coupled
with
an
apparent
familiarity
with
it
modified
witherby
more
and
more
he
began
to
see
that
he
had
got
a
prize
the
way
to
do
with
such
fellows
as
your
solid
men
continued
bartley
is
to
submit
a
proof
to
they
never
know
exactly
what
to
do
about
it
and
so
you
print
the
interview
with
their
approval
and
make
i
finish
up
the
series
for
you
and
i
wo
make
any
very
heavy
extra
i
should
wish
to
pay
you
whatever
the
work
was
worth
said
witherby
not
to
be
outdone
in
nobleness
all
right
we
quarrel
about
that
at
any
bartley
was
getting
toward
the
door
for
he
was
eager
to
be
gone
now
to
marcia
but
witherby
followed
him
up
as
if
willing
to
detain
him
my
wife
he
said
knows
miss
kingsbury
they
have
been
on
the
same
charities
i
met
her
a
good
while
ago
when
i
was
visiting
a
chum
of
mine
at
his
father
house
here
i
did
suppose
she
know
me
but
she
did
at
once
and
began
to
ask
me
if
i
was
at
the
hallecks
as
if
i
had
never
gone
mr
ezra
halleck
inquired
witherby
reverently
leather
trade
yes
said
bartley
i
believe
his
first
name
was
ezra
ben
halleck
was
my
friend
do
you
know
the
family
asked
bartley
yes
we
have
met
them
in
society
i
hope
you
pleasantly
situated
where
you
are
hubbard
should
be
glad
to
have
you
call
at
the
thank

said
bartley
my
wife
will
be
glad
to
have
witherby
oh
cried
witherby
i
did
know
you
were
married
that
good
nothing
like
marriage
hubbard
to
keep
a
man
going
in
the
right
direction
but
you
begun
pretty
nothing
like
taking
a
thing
in
time
answered
bartley
but
i
been
married
a
great
while
and
i
not
so
young
as
i
look
well
good
afternoon
did
you
say

your
address
asked
witherby
taking
out
his
my
wife

at
nantasket
now
but
she
be
up
the
first
part
of
september
and
then
she
call
they
shook
hands
at
last
and
bartley
ran
home
to
marcia
he
burst
into
the
room
with
a
glowing
face
well
marcia
he
shouted
i
got
my
basis
hush
no
do
be
so
loud
you
have
she
answered
springing
to
her
feet
i
do
believe
it
how
hot
you
are
i
been
running
almost
all
the
way
from
the
events
office
i
got
a
place
on
the
events
assistant
thirty
dollars
a
week
he
panted
i
knew
you
would
succeed
yet
i
knew
you
would
if
i
could
only
have
a
little
patience
i
been
scolding
myself
ever
since
you
went
i
thought
you
were
going
to
do
something
desperate
and
i
had
driven
you
to
it
but
bartley
bartley
it
ca
be
true
is
it
here
here
do
take
this
fan
or
no
i
fan
you
if
you
let
me
sit
on
your
knee
o
poor
thing
how
hot
you
are
but
i
thought
you
would
white
for
the
events
i
thought
you
hated
that
old
witherby
who
acted
so
ugly
to
you
when
you
first
oh
witherby
is
a
pretty
good
old
fellow
said
bartley
who
had
begun
to
get
his
breath
again
he
gave
her
a
full
history
of
the
affair
and
they
rejoiced
together
over
it
and
were
as
happy
as
if
bartley
had
been
celebrating
a
high
and
honorable
good
fortune
she
was
too
ignorant
to
feel
the
disgrace
if
there
were
any
in
the
compact
which
bartley
had
closed
and
he
had
no
principles
no
traditions
by
which
to
perceive
it
to
them
it
meant
unlimited
prosperity
it
meant
provision
for
the
future
which
was
to
bring
a
new
responsibility
and
a
new
care
we
will
take
the
parlor
with
the
alcove
now
said
bartley
do
excite
yourself
he
added
with
tender
warning
no
no
she
said
pillowing
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
shedding
peaceful
tears
it
does
seem
as
if
we
should
ever
quarrel
again
does
it
no
no
we
never
shall
she
murmured
it
has
always
come
from
my
worrying
you
about
the
law
and
i
shall
never
do
that
any
more
if
you
like
journalism
better
i
shall
not
urge
you
any
more
to
leave
it
now
got
your
but
i
going
on
with
the
law
now
for
that
very
reason
i
shall
read
law
all
my
leisure
time
i
feel
independent
and
i
shall
not
be
anxious
about
the
time
i
give
because
i
shall
know
that
i
can
afford
well
only
you
must
she
put
her
lips
against
his
cheek
you
more
to
me
than
anything
you
can
do
for
oh
marcia
xix
now
that
bartley
had
got
his
basis
and
had
no
favors
to
ask
of
any
one
he
was
curious
to
see
his
friend
halleck
again
but
when
in
the
course
of
the
solid
men
series
he
went
to
interview
a
nestor
of
the
leather
interest
as
he
meant
to
call
the
elder
halleck
he
resolved
to
let
him
make
all
the
advances
on
a
legitimate
business
errand
it
should
not
matter
to
him
whether
halleck
welcomed
him
or
not
the
old
man
did
not
wait
for
bartley
to
explain
why
he
came
he
was
so
simply
glad
to
see
him
that
bartley
felt
a
little
ashamed
to
confess
that
he
had
been
eight
months
in
boston
without
making
himself
known
he
answered
all
the
personal
questions
with
which
halleck
plied
him
and
in
his
turn
he
inquired
after
his
college
friend
ben
is
in
europe
said
his
father
he
has
been
there
all
summer
but
we
expect
him
home
about
the
middle
of
september
he
been
a
good
while
settling
down
continued
the
old
man
with
an
unconscious
sigh
he
talked
of
the
law
at
first
and
then
he
went
into
business
with
me
but
he
seem
to
find
his
calling
in
it
and
now
he
taken
up
the
law
again
been
in
the
law
school
at
cambridge
and
he
going
back
there
for
a
year
or
two
longer
i
thought
you
used
to
talk
of
the
law
yourself
when
you
were
with
us
yes
i
did
bartley
assented
and
i
have
given
up
the
notion
yet
i
read
a
good
deal
of
law
already
but
when
i
came
up
to
boston
i
had
to
go
into
newspaper
work
till
i
could
see
my
way
out
of
the
well
said
halleck
that
right
and
you
say
you
like
the
arrangement
you
made
with
witherby
it
ideal
for
me
answered
bartley
well
that
good
said
the
old
man
and
you
come
to
interview
me
well
that
all
right
i
not
much
used
to
being
in
print
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
tell
you
all
i
know
about
you
may
depend
upon
my
not
saying
anything
that
will
be
disagreeable
to
you
halleck
said
bartley
touched
by
the
old
man
trusting
friendliness
when
his
inquisition
ended
he
slipped
his
notebook
back
into
his
pocket
and
said
with
a
smile
we
usually
say
something
about
the
victim
private
residence
but
i
guess
i
spare
you
that
why
we
live
in
the
old
place
and
i
do
suppose
there
is
much
to
say
we
are
plain
people
and
we
do
like
to
change
when
i
built
there
thirty
years
ago
rumford
street
was
one
of
the
most
desirable
streets
in
boston
there
was
no
back
bay
then
you
know
and
we
thought
we
were
doing
something
very
fashionable
but
fashion
has
drifted
away
and
left
us
high
and
dry
enough
on
rumford
street
though
we
do
mind
it
we
keep
the
old
house
and
the
old
garden
pretty
much
as
you
saw
them
you
can
say
whatever
you
think
best
there
a
good
deal
of
talk
about
the
intrusiveness
of
the
newspapers
all
i
know
is
that
they
never
intruded
upon
me
we
shall
not
be
afraid
that
you
will
abuse
our
house
hubbard
because
we
expect
you
to
come
there
again
when
shall
it
be
halleck
and
i
have
been
at
home
all
summer
we
find
it
the
most
comfortable
place
and
we
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
drop
in
any
evening
and
take
tea
with
us
we
keep
the
old
hours
we
never
taken
kindly
to
the
late
dinners
the
girls
are
off
at
the
mountains
and
you
see
nobody
but
halleck
come
this
evening
cried
the
old
man
with
mounting
cordiality
his
warmth
as
he
put
his
hand
on
bartley
shoulder
made
the
young
man
blush
again
for
the
reserve
with
which
he
had
been
treating
his
own
affairs
he
stammered
out
hoping
that
the
other
would
see
the
relevancy
of
the
statement
why
the
fact
is
halleck
i
i
married
said
halleck
why
did
you
tell
me
before
of
course
we
want
hubbard
too
where
are
you
living
we
wo
stand
upon
ceremony
among
old
friends
halleck
will
come
with
the
carriage
and
fetch
hubbard
and
your
wife
must
take
that
for
a
call
why
you
do
know
how
glad
we
shall
be
to
have
you
both
i
wish
ben
was
married
you
come
of
course
we
will
said
bartley
but
you
must
let
halleck
send
for
us
we
can
walk
perfectly
can
walk
if
you
want
but
hubbard
shall
ride
said
the
old
man
when
bartley
reported
this
to
marcia
bartley
she
cried
in
her
carriage
i
afraid
nonsense
she
be
a
great
deal
more
afraid
than
you
are
she
the
bashfulest
old
lady
you
ever
saw
all
that
i
hope
is
that
you
overpower
bartley
hush
shall
i
wear
my
silk
or
oh
wear
the
silk
by
all
means
crush
them
at
a
blow
rumford
street
is
one
of
those
thoroughfares
at
the
west
end
of
boston
which
are
now
almost
wholly
abandoned
to
of
the
poorer
class
yet
they
are
charming
streets
quiet
clean
and
respectable
and
worthy
still
to
be
the
homes
as
they
once
were
of
solid
citizens
the
red
brick
houses
with
their
swell
fronts
looking
in
perspective
like
a
succession
of
round
towers
are
reached
by
broad
granite
steps
and
their
doors
are
deeply
sunken
within
the
of
roman
arches
over
the
door
there
is
sometimes
the
bow
of
a
fine
transom
and
the
parlor
windows
on
the
first
floor
of
the
swell
front
have
the
same
azure
gleam
as
those
of
the
beautiful
old
houses
which
front
the
common
on
beacon
street
when
her
husband
bought
his
lot
there
halleck
could
hardly
believe
that
a
house
on
rumford
street
was
not
too
fine
for
her
they
had
come
to
the
city
simple
and
good
young
village
people
and
simple
and
good
they
had
remained
through
the
advancing
years
which
had
so
wonderfully
halleck
hoped
with
a
trembling
heart
not
wickedly
prospered
them
they
were
of
faithful
stock
and
they
had
been
true
to
their
traditions
in
every
way
one
of
these
was
constancy
to
the
orthodox
religious
belief
in
which
their
young
hearts
had
united
and
which
had
blessed
all
their
life
though
their
charity
now
abounded
perhaps
more
than
their
faith
they
still
believed
that
for
themselves
there
was
no
spiritual
safety
except
in
their
church
but
since
their
younger
children
had
left
it
they
were
forced
tacitly
to
own
that
this
might
not
be
so
in
all
cases
their
last
endeavor
for
the
church
in
ben
case
was
to
send
him
to
the
college
where
he
and
bartley
met
and
this
was
such
a
failure
on
the
main
point
that
it
left
them
remorsefully
indulgent
he
had
submitted
and
had
foregone
his
boyish
dreams
of
harvard
where
all
his
mates
were
going
but
the
sacrifice
seemed
to
have
put
him
at
odds
with
life
the
years
which
had
proved
the
old
people
mistaken
would
not
come
back
upon
their
recognition
of
their
error
he
returned
to
the
associations
from
which
they
had
exiled
him
too
much
estranged
to
resume
them
and
they
saw
with
the
unavailing
regrets
which
visit
fathers
and
mothers
in
such
cases
that
the
young
know
their
own
world
better
than
their
elders
can
know
it
and
have
a
right
to
be
in
it
and
of
it
superior
to
any
theory
of
their
advantage
which
their
elders
can
form
ben
was
not
the
fellow
to
complain
in
fact
after
he
came
home
from
college
he
was
allowed
to
shape
his
life
according
to
his
own
rather
fitful
liking
his
father
was
glad
now
to
content
him
in
anything
he
could
it
was
so
very
little
that
ben
asked
if
he
had
suffered
it
perhaps
his
family
would
have
spoiled
him
the
halleck
girls
went
early
in
july
to
the
profile
house
where
they
had
spent
their
summers
for
many
years
but
the
old
people
preferred
to
stay
at
home
and
only
left
their
large
comfortable
house
for
short
absences
their
ways
of
life
had
been
fixed
in
other
times
and
halleck
liked
better
than
mountain
or
sea
the
garden
that
stretched
back
of
their
house
to
the
next
street
they
had
bought
through
to
this
street
when
they
built
but
they
had
never
sold
the
lot
that
fronted
on
it
they
laid
it
out
in
beds
and
there
were
clumps
of
hollyhocks
sunflowers
lilies
and
phlox
in
different
corners
grapes
covered
the
trellised
walls
there
were
some
that
bore
blossoms
and
sometimes
ripened
their
fruit
beside
the
walk
halleck
used
to
work
in
the
garden
her
husband
seldom
descended
into
it
but
he
liked
to
sit
on
the
balcony
overlooking
it
from
the
back
parlor
as
for
the
interior
of
the
house
it
had
been
furnished
once
for
all
in
the
worst
style
of
that
most
tasteless
period
of
household
art
which
prevailed
from
to
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
which
were
most
hideous
the
carpets
or
the
chandeliers
the
curtains
or
the
chairs
and
sofas
crude
colors
lumpish
and
meaningless
forms
abounded
in
a
rich
and
horrible
discord
the
old
people
thought
it
all
beautiful
and
those
daughters
who
had
come
into
the
new
house
as
little
girls
revered
it
but
ben
and
his
youngest
sister
who
had
been
born
in
the
house
used
the
right
of
children
of
their
parents
declining
years
to
laugh
at
it
yet
they
laughed
with
a
sort
of
filial
tenderness
i
suppose
you
know
how
frightful
you
have
everything
about
you
olive
said
clara
kingsbury
one
day
after
the
eastlake
movement
began
as
she
took
a
comprehensive
survey
of
the
halleck
through
her
certainly
answered
the
youngest
miss
halleck
it
a
perfect
chamber
of
horrors
but
i
like
it
because
everything
so
exquisitely
in
really
i
feel
as
if
i
had
seen
it
all
for
the
first
time
said
miss
kingsbury
i
do
believe
i
ever
realized
it
she
and
olive
halleck
were
great
friends
though
clara
was
fashionable
and
olive
was
not
it
would
all
have
been
different
ben
used
to
say
in
whimsical
sarcasm
of
what
he
had
once
believed
if
i
had
gone
to
harvard
then
the
fellows
in
my
class
would
have
come
to
the
house
with
me
and
we
should
have
got
into
the
right
set
naturally
now
we
outside
of
everything
and
it
makes
me
mad
because
we
got
money
enough
to
be
inside
and
nothing
to
prevent
it
of
course
i
not
going
to
say
that
leather
is
quite
as
blameless
as
cotton
socially
but
taken
in
the
wholesale
form
it
is
so
very
malodorous
and
it
quite
as
good
as
other
things
that
are
it
not
the
leather
ben
answered
olive
and
it
not
your
not
going
to
harvard
altogether
though
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
the
trouble
in
me
i
was
at
school
with
all
those
girls
clara
goes
with
and
i
could
have
been
in
that
set
if
i
wanted
but
i
did
really
want
to
i
saw
at
a
very
tender
age
that
it
was
going
to
be
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth
and
i
just
quietly
kept
out
of
it
of
course
i
could
have
gone
to
papanti
without
a
fuss
but
mother
would
have
let
me
go
if
i
had
made
the
fuss
and
i
could
be
hand
and
glove
with
those
girls
now
if
i
tried
they
come
here
whenever
i
ask
them
and
when
i
meet
them
on
charities
awfully
popular
no
if
i
not
fashionable
it
my
own
fault
but
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
ben
you
do
want
to
marry
any
of
those
girls
as
long
as
your
heart
set
on
that
unknown
charmer
of
ben
had
once
seen
his
charmer
in
the
street
of
a
little
down
east
town
where
he
met
her
walking
with
some
other
girls
in
a
freak
with
his
he
had
bribed
the
village
photographer
to
let
him
have
the
picture
of
the
young
lady
which
he
had
sent
home
to
olive
marked
my
lost
no
i
do
want
to
marry
anybody
said
ben
but
i
hate
to
live
in
a
town
where
i
not
first
chop
in
pshaw
cried
his
sister
i
guess
it
does
trouble
you
well
i
do
know
that
it
does
he
admitted
halleck
black
coachman
drove
her
to
nash
door
on
canary
place
where
she
alighted
and
rang
with
as
great
perturbation
as
if
it
had
been
a
palace
and
these
poor
young
people
to
whom
she
was
going
to
be
kind
were
princes
it
was
sufficient
that
they
were
strangers
but
anxiety
evident
even
to
meekness
like
halleck
restored
her
somewhat
to
her
and
the
thought
that
bartley
in
spite
of
his
personal
splendor
was
a
friend
of
ben
was
a
help
and
she
got
home
with
her
guests
without
any
great
chasms
in
the
conversation
though
she
never
ceased
to
twist
the
in
her
embarrassment
halleck
came
to
her
rescue
at
her
own
door
and
let
them
in
he
shook
hands
with
bartley
again
and
viewed
marcia
with
a
fatherly
friendliness
that
took
away
half
her
awe
of
the
ugly
magnificence
of
the
interior
but
still
she
admired
that
bartley
could
be
so
much
at
his
ease
he
pointed
to
a
stick
at
the
foot
of
the
and
said
how
much
that
looks
like
halleck
which
made
the
old
man
laugh
and
clap
him
on
the
shoulder
and
cry
so
it
does
so
it
does
recognized
it
did
you
well
we
shall
soon
have
him
with
us
again
now
seems
a
long
time
to
us
since
he
still
limps
a
little
asked
bartley
yes
i
guess
he
never
quite
get
over
i
do
believe
i
should
like
him
to
said
bartley
he
would
seem
natural
without
a
cane
in
his
hand
or
hanging
by
the
crook
over
his
left
elbow
while
he
stood
and
the
old
man
clapped
bartley
on
the
shoulder
again
and
laughed
again
at
the
image
suggested
that
so
that
so
you
right
i
as
soon
as
marcia
could
lay
off
her
things
in
the
gorgeous
chamber
to
which
halleck
had
shown
her
they
went
out
to
tea
in
the
overlooking
the
garden
seems
natural
do
it
asked
the
old
man
as
bartley
turned
to
one
of
the
windows
not
changed
a
bit
except
that
i
was
here
in
winter
and
i
had
a
chance
to
see
how
pretty
your
garden
it
is
pretty
is
it
said
the
old
man
mother
halleck
i
mean
looks
after
it
she
keeps
it
about
right
here
cyrus
he
said
as
the
came
into
the
room
with
something
from
the
kitchen
in
his
hands
you
remember
cyrus
i
guess
hubbard
oh
yes
said
bartley
and
when
cyrus
had
set
down
his
dish
bartley
shook
hands
with
the
new
hampshire
exemplar
of
freedom
and
equality
he
was
no
longer
so
young
as
to
wish
to
mark
a
social
difference
between
himself
and
the
who
had
served
halleck
with
unimpaired
for
years
there
was
a
vacant
place
at
table
and
halleck
said
he
hoped
it
would
be
taken
by
a
friend
of
theirs
he
explained
that
the
possible
guest
was
his
lawyer
whose
office
ben
was
going
into
after
he
left
the
law
school
and
presently
atherton
came
bartley
was
prepared
to
be
introduced
anew
but
he
was
flattered
and
the
hallecks
were
pleased
to
find
that
he
and
atherton
were
already
acquainted
the
latter
was
so
friendly
that
bartley
was
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
you
could
not
make
an
interview
too
strong
for
he
had
celebrated
atherton
among
the
other
people
present
at
the
indigent
entertainment
he
was
put
next
to
marcia
and
after
a
while
he
began
to
talk
with
her
feeling
with
a
tacit
skill
for
her
highest
note
and
striking
that
with
kindly
perseverance
it
was
not
a
very
high
note
and
it
was
not
always
a
certain
sound
she
could
not
be
sure
that
he
was
really
interested
in
the
simple
matters
he
had
set
her
to
talking
about
and
from
time
to
time
she
was
afraid
that
bartley
did
not
like
it
she
would
not
have
liked
him
to
talk
so
long
or
so
freely
with
a
lady
but
she
found
herself
talking
on
about
boarding
and
her
own
preference
for
keeping
house
about
equity
and
what
sort
of
place
it
was
and
how
far
from
crawford
about
boston
and
what
she
had
seen
and
done
there
since
she
had
come
in
the
winter
most
of
her
remarks
began
or
ended
with
hubbard
many
of
her
opinions
especially
in
matters
of
taste
were
frank
repetitions
of
what
hubbard
thought
her
conversation
had
the
charm
and
pathos
of
that
of
the
young
wife
who
devotedly
loves
her
husband
who
lives
in
and
for
him
tests
everything
by
him
refers
everything
to
him
she
had
a
good
mind
though
it
was
as
bare
as
it
could
well
be
of
most
of
the
things
that
the
ladies
of
atherton
world
put
into
their
minds
halleck
made
from
time
to
time
a
little
murmur
of
satisfaction
in
marcia
loyalty
and
then
sank
back
into
the
meek
silence
that
she
only
emerged
from
to
propose
more
tea
to
some
one
or
to
direct
cyrus
about
offering
this
dish
or
that
after
they
rose
she
took
marcia
about
to
show
her
the
house
ending
with
the
room
which
bartley
had
when
he
visited
there
they
sat
down
in
this
room
and
had
a
long
chat
and
when
they
came
back
to
the
parlor
they
found
atherton
already
gone
marcia
inferred
the
early
habits
of
the
household
from
the
departure
of
this
older
friend
but
bartley
was
in
no
hurry
he
was
enjoying
himself
and
he
could
not
see
that
halleck
seemed
at
all
sleepy
halleck
wished
to
send
them
home
in
her
carriage
but
they
would
not
hear
of
this
they
would
far
rather
walk
and
when
they
had
been
followed
to
the
door
and
bidden
mind
the
steps
as
they
went
down
the
wide
open
night
did
not
seem
too
large
for
their
content
in
themselves
and
each
other
did
you
have
a
nice
time
asked
bartley
though
he
knew
he
need
not
the
best
time
i
ever
had
in
the
world
cried
marcia
they
discussed
the
whole
affair
the
two
old
people
atherton
and
how
pleasant
he
was
the
house
and
its
splendors
which
they
did
not
know
were
hideous
bartley
said
marcia
at
last
i
did
you
he
returned
in
trepidation
but
after
a
while
he
laughed
well
all
right
if
you
wanted
yes
i
did
and
you
ca
think
how
kind
she
was
she
says
we
must
have
a
house
of
our
own
somewhere
and
she
going
round
with
me
in
her
carriage
to
help
me
to
find
well
said
bartley
and
he
fetched
a
sigh
half
of
pride
half
of
dismay
yes
i
long
to
go
to
housekeeping
we
can
afford
it
now
she
says
we
can
get
a
cheap
little
house
or
half
a
house
up
at
the
south
end
and
it
wo
cost
us
any
more
than
to
board
hardly
and
that
what
i
think
go
ahead
if
you
can
find
the
house
i
do
object
to
my
own
fireside
and
i
suppose
we
yes
we
must
ai
you
glad
of
it
they
were
in
the
shadow
of
a
tall
house
and
he
dropped
his
face
toward
the
face
she
lifted
to
his
and
gave
her
a
silent
kiss
that
made
her
heart
leap
toward
him
xx
with
the
other
news
that
halleck
mother
gave
him
on
his
return
she
told
him
of
the
chance
that
had
brought
his
old
college
comrade
to
them
again
and
of
how
bartley
was
now
married
and
was
just
settled
in
the
little
house
she
had
helped
his
wife
to
find
he
has
married
a
very
pretty
girl
she
said
oh
i
dare
say
answered
her
son
he
is
the
fellow
to
have
married
a
plain
your
father
and
i
have
been
to
call
upon
them
in
their
new
house
and
they
seem
very
happy
together
hubbard
wants
you
should
come
to
see
them
he
talks
a
great
deal
about
i
look
them
up
in
good
time
said
the
young
man
hubbard
ardor
to
see
me
will
that
evening
atherton
came
to
tea
and
halleck
walked
home
with
him
to
his
lodgings
which
were
over
the
hill
and
beyond
the
public
garden
yes
it
very
pleasant
getting
back
he
said
as
they
sauntered
down
the
common
side
of
beacon
street
and
the
old
town
is
picturesque
after
the
best
they
can
do
across
the
he
halted
his
friend
and
brought
himself
to
a
rest
on
his
cane
for
a
look
over
the
hollow
of
the
common
and
the
level
of
the
garden
where
the
late
september
dark
was
keenly
spangled
with
lamps
heart
leaps
up
and
so
forth
when
i
see
that
now
that
athens
and
florence
and
edinburgh
are
past
i
do
think
there
is
any
place
quite
so
well
worth
being
born
in
as
he
moved
forward
again
gently
surging
with
his
limp
in
a
way
that
had
its
charm
for
those
that
loved
him
it
more
authentic
and
individual
more
municipal
after
the
old
pattern
than
any
other
modern
city
it
gives
its
stamp
it
characterizes
the
boston
irishman
the
boston
jew
is
a
quite
different
irishman
or
jew
from
those
of
other
places
even
boston
provinciality
is
a
precious
testimony
to
the
authoritative
personality
of
the
city
cosmopolitanism
is
a
modern
vice
and
we
antique
we
classic
in
the
other
thing
yes
i
rather
be
a
bostonian
at
odds
with
boston
than
one
of
the
curled
darlings
of
any
other
a
friend
knows
how
to
allow
for
mere
quantity
in
your
talk
and
only
replies
to
the
quality
separates
your
earnest
from
your
whimsicality
and
accounts
for
some
whimsicality
in
your
earnest
i
did
know
but
you
might
have
got
that
bee
out
of
your
bonnet
on
the
other
side
said
atherton
no
sir
we
change
our
skies
but
not
our
bees
what
should
i
amount
to
without
my
grievance
you
would
have
known
me
this
talk
about
hubbard
has
set
my
bee
to
buzzing
with
uncommon
liveliness
and
the
thought
of
the
law
school
next
week
does
nothing
to
allay
him
the
law
school
harvard
i
realize
that
more
and
more
though
i
have
tried
to
fancy
that
it
was
no
sir
my
wrongs
are
irreparable
i
had
the
making
of
a
real
harvard
man
in
me
and
of
a
unitarian
nicely
balanced
between
radicalism
and
amateur
episcopacy
now
i
am
an
orthodox
ruin
and
the
undutiful
stepson
of
a
down
east
i
belong
nowhere
i
at
is
wife
really
handsome
or
is
she
only
she
beautiful
i
assure
you
she
beautiful
said
atherton
with
such
earnestness
that
halleck
laughed
well
that
right
as
my
father
says
how
she
beautiful
that
difficult
to
tell
it
rather
a
superb
sort
of
style
and
what
did
you
really
use
to
think
of
your
friend
atherton
broke
off
to
ask
who
hubbard
he
was
a
poor
cheap
sort
of
a
creature
deplorably
smart
and
regrettably
handsome
a
fellow
that
assimilated
everything
to
a
certain
extent
and
nothing
thoroughly
a
fellow
with
no
more
moral
nature
than
a
the
sort
of
chap
you
expect
to
find
the
next
time
you
met
him
in
congress
or
the
house
of
yes
that
accounts
for
it
said
atherton
thoughtfully
accounts
for
what
the
sort
of
look
she
had
a
look
as
if
she
were
naturally
above
him
and
had
somehow
fascinated
herself
with
him
and
were
worshipping
him
in
some
sort
of
does
that
sound
a
little
like
refining
upon
the
facts
recollect
never
seen
her
and
i
do
say
you
i
not
sure
i
not
though
i
talked
with
her
and
found
her
nothing
more
than
honest
and
sensible
and
good
simple
in
her
traditions
of
course
and
countrified
yet
in
her
ideas
with
a
tendency
to
the
intensely
practical
i
do
see
why
she
might
very
well
be
his
wife
i
suppose
every
woman
hoodwinks
herself
about
her
husband
in
some
yes
and
we
always
like
to
fancy
something
pathetic
in
the
fate
of
pretty
girls
that
other
fellows
marry
i
notice
that
we
do
sorrow
much
over
the
plain
ones
how
the
divine
clara
i
believe
she
well
said
atherton
i
have
seen
her
all
summer
she
been
at
why
i
should
have
supposed
she
would
have
come
up
and
those
indigent
children
with
her
own
hand
she
equal
to
it
what
made
her
falter
in
i
do
know
that
we
can
properly
call
it
faltering
there
was
a
deficit
in
the
appropriation
necessary
and
she
made
it
up
herself
after
that
she
consulted
me
seriously
as
to
whether
she
ought
not
to
stay
in
town
and
superintend
the
execution
of
the
plan
but
i
told
her
she
might
fitly
delegate
that
she
was
all
the
more
anxious
to
perform
her
whole
duty
because
she
confessed
that
indigent
children
were
personally
unpleasant
to
halleck
burst
out
laughing
that
like
clara
how
charming
women
are
they
charming
even
in
their
goodness
i
wonder
the
novelists
do
take
a
hint
from
that
fact
and
stop
giving
us
those
scaly
heroines
they
been
running
lately
why
a
real
woman
can
make
righteousness
delicious
and
virtue
piquant
i
like
them
for
that
do
you
asked
atherton
laughing
in
his
turn
at
the
confession
he
was
some
years
older
than
his
friend
they
had
got
down
to
charles
street
and
halleck
took
out
his
watch
at
the
corner
lamp
it
is
at
all
late
yet
only
eight
the
days
are
getting
well
suppose
we
go
and
call
on
hubbard
now
he
right
up
here
on
clover
street
i
do
know
said
atherton
it
would
do
for
you
you
an
old
friend
but
for
me
would
it
be
rather
unceremonious
oh
come
along
they
not
be
punctilious
they
like
our
dropping
in
and
i
shall
have
hubbard
off
my
conscience
i
must
go
to
see
him
sooner
or
later
for
decency
atherton
suffered
himself
to
be
led
away
i
suppose
you
wo
stay
long
oh
no
i
shall
cut
it
very
short
said
halleck
and
they
climbed
the
narrow
little
street
where
marcia
had
at
last
found
a
house
after
searching
the
south
end
quite
to
the
highlands
and
ransacking
charlestown
and
carnbridgeport
these
points
all
seemed
to
her
terribly
remote
from
where
bartley
must
be
at
work
during
the
day
and
she
must
be
alone
without
the
sight
of
him
from
morning
till
night
the
accessibility
of
canary
place
had
spoiled
her
for
distances
she
wanted
bartley
at
home
for
their
dinner
she
wanted
to
have
him
within
easy
call
at
all
times
and
she
was
glad
when
none
of
those
places
yielded
quite
what
they
desired
in
a
house
they
took
the
house
on
clover
street
though
it
was
a
little
dearer
than
they
expected
for
two
years
and
they
furnished
it
as
far
as
they
could
out
of
the
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
they
had
saved
including
the
remaining
hundred
from
the
colt
and
cutter
kept
sacredly
intact
by
marcia
when
you
entered
the
narrow
staircase
cramped
you
into
the
little
parlor
opening
out
of
the
hall
and
back
of
the
parlor
was
the
overhead
were
two
chambers
and
overhead
again
were
two
chambers
more
in
the
basement
was
the
kitchen
the
house
seemed
absurdly
large
to
people
who
had
been
living
for
the
last
seven
months
in
one
room
and
the
view
of
the
back
bay
from
the
little
of
the
front
chamber
added
all
outdoors
to
their
superfluous
space
bartley
came
himself
to
answer
halleck
ring
and
they
met
at
once
with
such
a
why
halleck
and
how
do
you
do
hubbard
as
restored
something
of
their
old
college
comradery
bartley
welcomed
atherton
under
the
he
had
turned
up
and
then
they
huddled
into
the
little
parlor
where
bartley
introduced
his
old
friend
to
his
wife
marcia
wore
a
sort
of
dark
robe
trimmed
with
bows
of
crimson
ribbon
which
she
had
made
herself
and
in
which
she
looked
a
roman
patrician
in
an
avatar
of
boston
domesticity
and
bartley
was
rather
proud
to
see
his
friend
so
visibly
dazzled
by
her
beauty
it
quite
abashed
halleck
who
limped
helplessly
about
after
his
cane
had
been
taken
from
him
before
he
sat
down
while
marcia
from
the
vantage
of
the
sofa
and
the
covert
of
her
talk
with
atherton
was
content
that
halleck
should
be
plain
and
awkward
with
drab
hair
and
a
dull
complexion
she
would
not
have
liked
even
a
man
who
knew
bartley
before
she
did
to
be
very
handsome
halleck
and
bartley
had
some
talk
about
college
days
from
which
their
eyes
wandered
at
times
and
then
marcia
excused
herself
to
atherton
and
went
out
reappearing
after
an
interval
at
the
sliding
doors
which
she
rolled
open
between
the
parlor
and
a
table
set
for
supper
stood
behind
her
and
as
she
leaned
a
little
forward
with
her
hands
each
on
a
leaf
of
the
door
she
said
with
shy
pride
bartley
i
thought
the
gentlemen
would
like
to
join
you
and
he
answered
of
course
they
would
and
led
the
way
out
refusing
to
hear
any
demur
his
heart
swelled
with
satisfaction
in
marcia
it
was
something
like
having
fellows
drop
in
upon
you
and
be
asked
out
to
supper
in
this
easy
way
it
made
bartley
feel
good
and
he
would
have
liked
to
give
marcia
a
hug
on
the
spot
he
could
not
help
pressing
her
foot
under
the
table
and
exchanging
a
quiver
of
the
eyelashes
with
her
as
he
lifted
the
lid
of
the
white
tureen
and
looked
at
her
across
the
glitter
of
their
new
crockery
and
cutlery
they
made
the
jokes
of
the
season
about
the
oyster
being
promptly
on
hand
for
the
first
of
the
r
months
and
bartley
explained
that
he
was
sometimes
kept
at
the
events
office
rather
late
and
that
then
marcia
waited
supper
for
him
and
always
gave
him
an
oyster
stew
which
she
made
herself
she
could
not
stop
him
and
the
guests
praised
the
oysters
and
then
they
praised
the
and
the
parlor
and
when
they
rose
from
the
table
bartley
said
now
we
must
show
you
the
house
and
persisted
against
her
deprecations
in
making
her
lead
the
way
she
was
in
fact
willing
enough
to
show
it
her
taste
had
made
their
money
go
to
the
utmost
in
furnishing
it
and
though
most
people
were
then
still
in
the
period
of
green
reps
and
tan
terry
and
of
dull
movables
she
had
everywhere
bestowed
little
touches
that
told
she
had
covered
the
marble
with
cloth
and
fringed
it
and
she
had
set
on
it
two
vases
in
the
pompeiian
colors
then
liked
her
carpet
was
of
wood
color
and
a
moss
pattern
she
had
done
what
could
be
done
with
folding
carpet
chairs
to
give
the
little
room
a
specious
air
of
luxury
the
was
heaped
with
her
sewing
and
newspapers
we
just
moved
in
and
we
have
furnished
the
rooms
yet
she
said
of
two
empty
ones
which
bartley
perversely
flung
open
and
i
do
know
that
we
shall
the
house
is
much
too
big
for
us
but
we
thought
we
better
take
it
he
added
as
if
it
were
a
castle
for
vastness
halleck
and
atherton
were
silent
for
some
moments
after
they
came
away
and
then
do
believe
he
whips
her
suggested
the
latter
no
i
guess
he
fond
of
her
said
halleck
gravely
did
you
see
how
careful
he
was
of
her
coming
up
and
down
stairs
that
was
very
pretty
and
it
was
pretty
to
see
them
both
so
ready
to
show
off
their
young
housekeeping
to
yes
it
improves
a
man
to
get
married
said
halleck
with
a
long
stifled
sigh
it
improved
the
most
selfish
hound
i
ever
xxi
the
two
elder
miss
hallecks
were
so
much
older
than
olive
the
youngest
that
they
seemed
to
be
of
a
sort
of
intermediary
generation
between
her
and
her
parents
though
olive
herself
was
well
out
of
her
teens
and
was
the
senior
of
her
brother
ben
by
two
or
three
years
the
elder
sisters
were
always
together
and
they
adhered
in
common
to
the
religion
of
their
father
and
mother
the
defection
of
their
brother
was
passive
but
olive
having
conscientiously
adopted
an
alien
faith
was
not
a
person
to
let
others
imagine
her
ashamed
of
it
and
her
unitarianism
was
outspoken
in
her
turn
she
formed
a
kind
of
party
with
ben
inside
the
family
and
would
have
led
him
on
in
her
own
excesses
of
independence
if
his
somewhat
melancholy
indifferentism
had
consented
it
was
only
in
his
absence
that
she
had
been
with
her
sisters
during
their
summer
sojourn
in
the
white
mountains
when
they
returned
home
she
vigorously
went
her
way
and
left
them
to
go
theirs
she
was
fond
of
them
in
her
defiant
fashion
but
in
such
a
matter
as
calling
on
hubbard
she
chose
not
to
be
mixed
up
with
her
family
or
in
any
way
to
countenance
her
family
prepossessions
her
sisters
paid
their
visit
together
and
she
waited
for
clara
kingsbury
to
come
up
from
the
seaside
then
she
went
with
her
to
call
upon
marcia
sitting
observant
and
while
clara
swooped
through
the
little
house
up
stairs
and
down
clamoring
over
its
prettiness
and
admiring
the
art
with
which
so
few
dollars
could
be
made
to
go
so
far
think
of
finding
such
a
bower
on
clover
street
she
made
marcia
give
her
the
cost
of
everything
and
her
heart
swelled
with
pride
in
her
sex
when
she
heard
that
marcia
had
put
down
all
the
carpets
herself
i
wanted
to
make
them
up
marcia
explained
but
hubbard
would
let
me
it
cost
so
little
at
the
would
let
you
cried
miss
kingsbury
i
should
hope
as
much
indeed
why
my
child
you
a
roman
matron
she
came
away
in
agony
lest
marcia
might
think
she
meant
her
nose
she
drove
early
the
next
morning
to
tell
olive
halleck
that
she
had
spent
a
sleepless
night
from
this
cause
and
to
ask
her
what
she
do
do
you
think
she
will
be
hurt
olive
tell
me
what
led
up
to
it
how
did
i
behave
before
that
the
context
is
everything
in
such
oh
you
went
about
praising
everything
and
screaming
and
shouting
and
and
her
and
patronizing
there
there
say
no
more
that
sufficient
i
see
i
see
it
all
done
the
very
most
offensive
thing
i
could
when
i
meant
to
be
the
most
these
country
people
do
like
to
be
appreciated
down
to
the
quick
in
that
way
said
olive
i
should
think
hubbard
was
rather
a
proud
i
know
i
know
moaned
miss
kingsbury
it
was
do
suppose
she
ashamed
of
her
nose
olive
cried
her
friend
be
still
why
i
ca
it
why
you
wretched
thing
i
dare
say
all
the
ladies
in
equity
make
up
their
own
carpets
and
put
them
down
and
she
thought
you
were
laughing
at
you
be
still
olive
halleck
miss
kingsbury
was
now
a
large
blonde
mass
of
suffering
oh
dear
dear
what
shall
i
do
it
was
sacrilege
yes
it
was
nothing
less
than
sacrilege
to
go
on
as
i
did
and
i
meant
so
well
i
did
so
admire
and
respect
and
revere
her
olive
burst
out
laughing
you
wicked
girl
whimpered
clara
should
you
should
you
write
to
her
and
tell
her
you
did
mean
her
nose
oh
by
all
means
clara
by
all
means
quite
an
inspiration
why
not
make
her
an
evening
party
olive
said
clara
with
guilty
meekness
i
have
been
thinking
of
clara
not
seriously
cried
olive
sobered
at
the
idea
yes
seriously
would
it
be
so
very
bad
only
just
a
party
she
pleaded
half
a
dozen
people
or
so
just
to
show
them
that
i
really
feel
friendly
i
know
that
he
told
her
all
about
meeting
me
here
and
i
not
going
to
have
her

i
want
to
drop
him
because
he

in
a
little
house

clover

to
bring
them
out
in
boston
society

will
you
do
with
them
after
you

them
there
miss
kingsbury
fidgeted
in
her
chair
a
little
now
look
me
in
the
eye
clara

were
you
going
to
ask
to
meet
them
your
unfashionable
friends
the
hallecks
my
friends
the
hallecks
of
and
atherton
your
legal
adviser

had
thought
of
asking
atherton
you
need
say
what
he
is
if
you
please
olive
you
know
that
there
no
one
i
prize
so
very
good

recent
attachment

nice
girl
she
is
studying
at
the
yes
votary
of
miss
kingsbury
well
miss
unfashionable
sister
of
fashionable
artist
yes
the
young
radical
clergyman
and
his
wife
without
a
congregation
and
hoping
for
a
pulpit
in
billerica
parlor
lectures
on
german
literature
in
the
mean
time
well
and
savage
i
young
widow
of
uncertain
antecedents
tending
to
grassiness
of
the
hostess
yes
clara
go
on
and
give
your
party
it
will
be
but
do
you
think
it
will
anybody
now
olive
halleck
cried
clara
i
am
not
going
to
have
you
talking
to
me
in
that
way
you
have
no
right
to
do
it
and
you
have
no
business
to
do
it
she
added
trying
to
pluck
up
a
spirit
is
there
anybody
that
i
value
more
than
i
do
you
and
your
sisters
and
ben
no
but
you
do
value
us
in
that
and
you
know
it
do
you
be
a
humbug
clara
now
go
on
with
your
i
not
making
excuses
is
atherton
in
the
most
fashionable
society
yes
why
do
you
ask
some
other
fashionable
people
olive
this
is
all
nonsense
perfect
nonsense
i
can
invite
any
one
i
like
to
meet
any
one
i
like
and
if
i
choose
to
show
hubbard
wife
a
little
attention
i
can
do
it
ca
i
oh
of
course
and
what
would
be
the
use
of
inviting
fashionable
people
as
you
call
them
to
meet
them
it
would
just
embarrass
them
all
perfectly
correct
miss
kingsbury
all
that
want
you
to
do
is
to
face
the
facts
of
the
case
i
want
you
to
realize
that
in
showing
wife
this
little
attention
you
not
doing
it
because
you
scorn
to
drop
an
old
friend
and
want
to
do
him
the
highest
honor
but
because
you
think
you
can
palm
off
your
acquaintance
on
them
for
and
try
to
make
up
in
that
way
for
telling
her
she
had
a
hooked
nose
you
that
i
did
tell
her
she
had
a
hooked
you
told
her
that
she
was
a
roman
matron
it
the
same
thing
said
olive
miss
kingsbury
bit
her
lip
and
tried
to
look
a
dignified
resentment
she
ended
by
saying
with
feeble
spite
i
shall
have
the
little
evening
for
all
you
say
i
suppose
you
wo
refuse
to
come
because
i
do
ask
the
whole
blue
book
to
meet
of
course
we
shall
come
i
would
miss
it
for
anything
i
always
like
to
see
how
you
manage
your
pieces
of
social
duplicity
clara
but
you
expect
that
i
will
be
a
party
to
the
swindle
no
clara
i
shall
go
to
these
poor
young
people
and
tell
them
plainly
is
not
the
society
miss
kingsbury
keeps
that
for
olive
i
think
i
never
saw
even
you
in
such
a
teasing
the
tears
came
into
clara
large
tender
blue
eyes
and
she
continued
with
an
appeal
that
had
no
effect
i
sure
i
do
see
why
you
should
make
it
a
question
of
anything
of
the
sort
it
simply
a
wish
to
to
have
a
little
company
of
no
particular
kind
for
no
partic
because
i
want
oh
that
it
is
it
then
i
highly
approve
of
it
said
olive
when
is
it
to
be
i
tell
you
now
you
may
wait
till
i
ready
pouted
clara
as
she
rose
to
go
do
go
away
thinking
i
enough
to
provoke
a
saint
because
got
mad
at
me
clara
mad
you
know
i
not
mad
but
i
think
you
might
be
a
sympathetic
olive
said
her
friend
kissing
her
not
in
cases
of
social
duplicity
clara
my
wrath
is
all
that
saves
you
if
you
were
not
afraid
of
me
you
would
have
been
a
lost
worldling
long
i
know
you
always
really
love
me
said
miss
kingsbury
tenderly
no
i
do
retorted
her
friend
promptly
not
when
you
humbugging
do
expect
it
for
you
wo
get
she
followed
clara
with
a
triumphant
laugh
as
she
went
out
of
the
door
and
except
for
this
parting
taunt
clara
might
have
given
up
her
scheme
she
first
ordered
her
driven
home
in
fact
and
then
lowered
the
window
to
countermand
the
direction
and
drove
to
bartley
door
on
clover
street
it
was
a
very
handsome
equipage
and
was
in
keeping
with
all
the
outward
belongings
of
miss
kingsbury
who
mingled
a
sense
of
duty
and
a
love
of
luxury
in
her
life
in
very
exact
proportions
when
her
was
not
standing
before
some
of
the
wretchedest
doors
in
the
city
it
was
waiting
at
the
finest
and
clara
days
were
divided
between
the
extremes
of
squalor
and
of
fashion
she
was
the
only
child
of
parents
who
had
early
left
her
an
orphan
her
father
who
was
much
her
mother
senior
was
an
old
friend
of
father
and
had
made
him
his
executor
and
the
guardian
of
his
daughter
halleck
had
taken
her
into
his
own
family
and
in
the
conscientious
pursuance
of
what
he
believed
would
have
been
her
father
preference
he
gave
her
worldly
advantages
which
he
would
not
have
desired
for
one
of
his
own
children
but
the
friendship
that
grew
up
between
clara
and
olive
was
too
strong
for
him
in
some
things
and
the
girls
went
to
the
same
fashionable
school
together
when
his
ward
came
of
age
he
made
over
to
her
the
fortune
increased
by
his
careful
management
which
her
father
had
left
her
and
advised
her
to
put
her
affairs
in
the
hands
of
atherton
she
had
shown
a
quite
ungirlish
eagerness
to
manage
them
for
herself
in
the
midst
of
her
profusion
she
had
odd
accesses
of
stinginess
in
which
she
fancied
herself
coming
to
poverty
and
her
guardian
judged
it
best
that
she
should
have
a
lawyer
who
could
tell
her
at
any
moment
just
where
she
stood
she
hesitated
but
she
did
as
he
advised
and
having
once
intrusted
her
property
to
atherton
care
she
added
her
conscience
and
her
reason
in
large
degree
and
obeyed
him
with
embarrassing
promptness
in
matters
that
did
not
interfere
with
her
pleasures
her
pleasures
were
of
various
kinds
she
chose
to
buy
herself
a
fine
house
and
having
furnished
it
luxuriously
and
unearthed
a
cousin
of
her
father
in
vermont
and
brought
her
to
boston
to
matronize
her
she
kept
house
on
a
magnificent
scale
pinching
however
at
certain
points
with
unexpected
meanness
when
she
was
alone
her
table
was
of
a
spartan
austerity
she
exacted
a
great
deal
from
her
servants
and
paid
them
as
small
wages
as
she
could
after
that
she
did
not
mind
lavishing
money
upon
them
in
kindness
a
seamstress
whom
she
had
once
employed
fell
sick
and
miss
kingsbury
sent
her
to
the
bahamas
and
kept
her
there
till
she
was
well
and
then
made
her
a
guest
in
her
house
till
the
girl
could
get
back
her
work
she
watched
her
cook
through
the
measles
caring
for
her
like
a
mother
and
as
olive
halleck
said
she
was
always
portioning
or
burying
the
sisters
of
her
she
was
in
all
sorts
of
charities
but
she
was
apt
to
cut
her
charities
off
with
her
pleasures
at
any
moment
if
she
felt
poor
she
was
fond
of
dress
and
went
a
great
deal
into
society
she
suspected
men
generally
of
wishing
to
marry
her
for
her
money
but
with
those
whom
she
did
not
think
capable
of
aspiring
to
her
hand
she
was
generously
helpful
with
her
riches
she
liked
to
patronize
she
had
long
supported
an
unpromising
painter
at
rome
and
she
gave
orders
to
desperate
artists
at
home
the
world
had
pretty
well
hardened
one
half
of
her
heart
but
the
other
half
was
still
soft
and
loving
and
into
this
side
of
her
mixed
nature
she
cowered
when
she
believed
she
had
committed
some
blunder
or
crime
and
came
whimpering
to
olive
halleck
for
punishment
she
made
olive
her
discipline
partly
in
her
lack
of
some
fixed
religion
she
had
not
yet
found
a
religion
that
exactly
suited
her
though
she
had
many
times
believed
herself
about
to
be
anchored
in
some
faith
forever
she
was
almost
sorry
that
she
had
put
her
resolution
in
effect
when
she
rang
at
the
door
and
marcia
herself
answered
the
bell
in
place
of
the
one
servant
who
was
at
that
moment
hanging
out
the
wash
it
seemed
wicked
to
pretend
to
be
showing
this
pretty
creature
a
social
attention
when
she
meant
to
palm
off
a
hollow
imitation
of
society
upon
her
why
should
she
not
ask
the
very
superfinest
of
her
friends
to
meet
such
a
brilliant
beauty
it
would
serve
olive
halleck
right
if
she
should
do
this
and
leave
the
hallecks
out
and
marcia
would
certainly
be
a
sensation
she
half
believed
that
she
meant
to
do
it
when
she
quitted
the
house
with
promise
that
she
would
bring
her
husband
to
tea
on
wednesday
evening
at
eight
and
she
drove
away
so
far
penitent
that
she
resolved
at
least
to
make
her
company
distinguished
if
not
fashionable
she
said
to
herself
that
she
would
make
it
fashionable
yet
if
she
chose
and
as
a
first
move
in
this
direction
she
easily
secured
atherton
he
had
no
engagements
so
few
people
had
got
back
to
town
she
called
upon
witherby
needlessly
reminding
her
of
the
charity
committees
they
had
served
on
together
and
then
she
went
home
and
actually
sent
out
notes
to
the
plainest
daughter
and
the
maiden
aunt
of
two
of
the
most
families
of
her
acquaintance
she
added
to
her
list
an
artist
and
his
wife
now
i
shall
to
let
him
paint
me
she
reflected
a
young
author
whose
book
had
made
talk
a
teacher
of
italian
with
whom
she
was
pretending
to
read
dante
and
a
musical
composer
olive
came
late
as
if
to
get
a
whole
effect
of
the
affair
at
once
and
her
smile
revealed
clara
failure
to
her
if
she
had
not
realized
it
before
she
read
there
that
the
aristocratic
and
aesthetic
additions
which
she
had
made
to
the
guests
olive
originally
divined
had
not
sufficed
the
party
remained
a
humbug
it
had
seemed
absurd
to
invite
anybody
to
meet
two
such
little
unknown
people
as
the
hubbards
and
then
to
avoid
marking
them
as
the
subjects
of
the
festivity
by
the
precedence
to
be
observed
in
going
out
to
supper
she
resolved
to
have
tea
served
in
the
and
to
make
it
literally
tea
with
bread
and
butter
and
some
thin
ascetic
cakes
however
sharp
he
was
in
business
witherby
was
socially
a
dull
man
and
his
wife
and
daughter
seemed
to
partake
of
his
qualities
by
affinition
and
heredity
they
tried
to
make
something
of
marcia
but
they
failed
through
their
want
of
art
witherby
finding
the
wife
of
her
assistant
in
miss
kingsbury
house
conceived
an
awe
of
her
which
marcia
would
not
have
known
how
to
abate
if
she
had
imagined
it
and
in
a
little
while
the
witherby
family
segregated
themselves
among
the
photograph
albums
and
the
bricabrac
from
which
clara
seemed
to
herself
to
be
fruitlessly
detaching
them
the
whole
evening
the
plainest
daughter
and
the
maiden
aunt
of
the
patrician
families
talked
to
each
other
with
unavailing
intervals
of
the
painter
and
the
author
and
the
radical
clergyman
and
his
wife
were
in
danger
of
a
conjugal
devotion
which
society
does
not
favor
the
unfashionable
sister
of
the
fashionable
artist
conversed
with
the
young
tutor
and
the
japanese
whom
he
had
asked
leave
to
bring
with
him
and
whose
small
eyes
continually
twinkled
away
in
pursuit
of
the
blonde
beauty
of
his
hostess
the
widow
was
winningly
attentive
with
a
tendency
to
be
confidential
to
everybody
the
italian
could
not
disabuse
himself
of
the
notion
that
he
was
expected
to
be
light
and
cheerful
and
when
the
pupil
of
the
conservatory
sang
he
abandoned
himself
to
his
error
and
clapped
and
cried
bravo
with
unseemly
vivacity
but
he
was
restored
to
reason
when
the
composer
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
played
amid
the
hush
that
falls
on
society
at
such
times
something
from
beethoven
and
again
something
of
his
own
which
was
so
like
beethoven
that
beethoven
himself
would
not
have
known
the
difference
atherton
and
halleck
moved
about
among
the
guests
and
did
their
best
to
second
clara
efforts
for
their
encouragement
but
it
was
useless
in
the
desperation
which
owns
defeat
she
resolved
to
devote
herself
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
to
trying
to
make
at
least
the
hubbards
have
a
good
time
and
then
upon
the
dangerous
theory
of
which
young
and
pretty
hostesses
can
not
be
too
wary
that
a
wife
is
necessarily
flattered
by
attentions
to
her
husband
she
devoted
herself
exclusively
to
bartley
to
whom
she
talked
long
and
with
a
reckless
liveliness
of
the
events
of
his
former
stay
in
boston
their
laughter
and
scraps
of
their
reminiscence
reached
marcia
where
she
sat
in
a
feint
of
listening
to
ben
perfunctory
account
of
his
college
days
with
her
husband
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
rose
abruptly
and
going
to
him
she
said
that
it
was
time
to
say
oh
so
soon
cried
clara
mystified
and
a
little
scared
at
the
look
she
saw
on
marcia
face
good
night
she
added
coldly
the
assembly
hailed
this
first
token
of
its
disintegration
with
relief
it
became
a
little
livelier
there
was
a
fleeting
moment
in
which
it
seemed
as
if
it
might
yet
enjoy
itself
but
its
chance
passed
it
crumbled
rapidly
away
and
clara
was
left
looking
humbly
into
olive
halleck
pitiless
eyes
thank
you
for
a
evening
miss
kingsbury
congratulate
you
she
mocked
with
an
unsparing
laugh
such
a
success
but
why
did
you
give
them
something
to
eat
clara
those
poor
hubbards
have
a
dinner
and
i
famished
for
them
i
was
hungry
myself
have
a
dinner
xxii
bartley
came
home
elate
from
miss
kingsbury
entertainment
it
was
something
like
the
social
success
which
he
used
to
picture
to
himself
he
had
been
flattered
by
the
attention
specially
paid
him
and
he
did
not
detect
the
imposition
he
was
half
starved
but
he
meant
to
have
up
some
cold
meat
and
bottled
beer
and
talk
it
all
over
with
marcia
she
did
not
seem
inclined
to
talk
it
over
on
their
way
home
and
when
they
entered
their
own
door
she
pushed
in
and
ran
why
where
are
you
going
marcia
he
called
after
her
to
bed
she
replied
closing
the
door
after
her
with
a
crash
of
unmistakable
significance
bartley
stood
a
moment
in
the
fury
that
tempted
him
to
pursue
her
with
a
taunt
and
then
leave
her
to
work
herself
out
of
the
transport
of
senseless
jealousy
she
had
wrought
herself
into
but
he
set
his
teeth
and
full
of
inward
cursing
he
followed
her
with
a
slow
dogged
step
he
took
her
in
his
arms
without
a
word
and
held
her
fast
while
his
anger
changed
to
pity
and
then
to
laughing
when
it
came
to
that
she
put
up
her
arms
which
she
had
kept
rigidly
at
her
side
and
laid
them
round
his
neck
and
began
softly
to
cry
on
his
breast
oh
i
not
myself
at
all
any
more
she
moaned
penitently
then
this
is
very
improper
for
me
said
bartley
the
helpless
laughter
broke
through
her
lamentation
but
she
cried
a
little
more
to
keep
herself
in
countenance
but
i
guess
from
a
previous
acquaintance
with
the
party
character
that
it
really
all
you
marcia
i
do
blame
you
miss
hospitality
has
left
me
as
hollow
as
if
i
had
nothing
to
eat
for
a
week
and
i
know
you
perishing
from
inanition
hence
these
it
delighted
her
to
have
him
make
fun
of
miss
kingsbury
tea
and
she
lifted
her
head
to
let
him
see
that
she
was
laughing
for
pleasure
now
before
she
turned
away
to
dry
her
eyes
oh
poor
fellow
she
cried
i
did
pity
you
so
when
i
saw
those
mean
little
slices
of
bread
and
butter
coming
round
yes
said
bartley
i
felt
sorry
myself
but
do
speak
of
them
any
more
and
i
suppose
pursued
marcia
that
all
the
time
she
was
talking
to
you
there
you
were
simply
i
was
casting
lots
in
my
own
mind
to
see
which
of
the
company
i
should
devour
his
drollery
appeared
to
marcia
the
finest
that
ever
was
she
laughed
and
laughed
again
when
he
made
fun
of
the
conjecturable
toughness
of
the
elderly
aristocrat
she
implored
him
to
stop
if
he
did
not
want
to
kill
her
marcia
was
not
in
the
state
in
which
woman
best
convinces
her
enemies
of
her
fitness
for
empire
though
she
was
charming
in
her
silly
happiness
and
bartley
felt
very
glad
that
he
had
not
yielded
to
his
first
impulse
to
deal
savagely
with
her
come
he
said
let
us
go
out
somewhere
and
get
some
she
began
at
once
to
take
out
her
and
loosen
her
hair
no
i
get
something
here
in
the
house
i
not
very
hungry
but
go
bartley
and
have
a
good
supper
or
you
be
sick
and
not
fit
to
work
go
she
added
to
his
hesitating
image
in
the
glass
i
insist
upon
it
i
wo
you
his
reflected
face
approached
from
behind
she
turned
hers
a
little
and
their
mirrored
lips
met
over
her
shoulder
oh
how
you
are
bartley
she
murmured
yes
you
will
always
find
me
obedient
when
commanded
to
go
out
and
repair
my
wasted
i
do
mean
dear
she
said
softly
i
mean
your
not
quarrelling
with
me
when
i
unreasonable
why
ca
we
always
do
so
well
you
see
said
bartley
it
throws
the
whole
burden
on
the
fellow
in
his
senses
it
does
require
any
great
degree
of
to
fly
off
at
a
tangent
but
it
rather
a
maddening
spectacle
to
the
party
that
holds
now
i
will
show
you
said
marcia
that
i
can
be
reasonable
too
i
shall
let
you
go
alone
to
make
our
party
call
on
miss
she
looked
at
him
heroically
marcia
said
bartley
you
such
a
reasonable
person
when
you
the
most
unreasonable
that
i
wonder
i
quarrel
with
you
i
rather
think
i
let
call
on
miss
kingsbury
alone
i
shall
suffer
agonies
of
suspicion
but
it
will
prove
that
i
have
perfect
confidence
in
he
threw
her
a
kiss
from
the
door
and
ran
down
the
stairs
when
he
returned
an
hour
later
he
found
her
waiting
up
for
him
why
marcia
he
exclaimed
oh
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
we
will
both
go
to
call
on
her
if
i
sent
you
she
might
think
i
was
mad
and
i
wo
give
her
that
noble
girl
cried
bartley
with
irony
that
pleased
her
better
than
praise
women
like
to
be
understood
even
when
they
try
not
to
be
understood
when
marcia
went
with
bartley
to
call
miss
kingsbury
received
her
with
careful
perhaps
anxious
politeness
but
made
no
further
effort
to
take
her
up
some
of
the
people
whom
marcia
met
at
miss
kingsbury
called
and
the
witherbys
came
father
mother
and
daughter
together
but
between
the
evident
fact
that
the
hubbards
were
poor
and
the
other
evident
fact
that
they
moved
in
the
best
society
the
witherbys
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
about
them
they
asked
them
to
dinner
and
bartley
went
alone
marcia
was
not
well
enough
to
go
he
was
very
kind
and
tractable
now
and
went
whenever
she
bade
him
go
without
her
though
tea
at
the
hallecks
was
getting
to
be
an
old
story
with
him
and
it
was
generally
tea
at
the
hallecks
to
which
she
sent
him
the
halleck
ladies
came
faithfully
to
see
her
and
she
got
on
very
well
with
the
two
older
sisters
who
gave
her
all
the
kindness
they
could
spare
from
their
charities
and
seemed
pleased
to
have
her
so
pretty
and
conjugal
though
these
things
were
far
from
them
but
she
was
afraid
of
olive
at
first
and
disliked
her
as
a
friend
of
miss
kingsbury
this
rather
attracted
the
odd
girl
what
she
called
marcia
snubs
enabled
her
to
declare
in
her
favor
with
a
sense
of
disinterestedness
and
to
indulge
her
repugnance
for
bartley
with
a
good
heart
she
resented
his
odious
good
looks
and
held
it
a
shame
that
her
mother
should
promote
his
visible
tendency
to
stoutness
by
giving
him
such
nice
things
for
tea
now
i
like
hubbard
said
her
mother
placidly
it
very
kind
of
him
to
come
to
such
plain
folks
as
we
are
whenever
we
ask
him
now
that
his
wife
ca
come
i
know
he
does
it
because
he
likes
oh
he
comes
for
the
eating
said
olive
scornfully
then
another
phase
of
her
mother
remark
struck
her
why
mother
she
cried
i
do
believe
you
think
bartley
hubbard
a
distinguished
man
somehow
your
father
says
it
very
unusual
for
such
a
young
man
to
be
in
a
place
like
his
witherby
really
leaves
everything
to
him
he
well
i
think
he
better
not
then
the
events
has
got
to
be
perfectly
horrid
of
late
it
full
of
murders
and
all
that
seems
to
be
the
way
with
the
papers
nowadays
your
father
hears
that
the
events
is
making
why
mother
what
a
corrupt
old
thing
you
are
i
believe
you
been
bought
up
by
that
disgusting
interview
with
father
nestor
of
the
leather
interest
father
ought
to
have
turned
him
out
of
doors
well
this
family
is
getting
a
little
good
for
me
and
ben
almost
as
bad
as
any
of
you
of
late
i
have
a
bit
of
influence
with
him
any
more
he
seems
determined
to
be
friendlier
with
that
than
ever
he
always
trying
to
do
him
good
i
can
see
it
and
it
makes
me
sick
one
thing
i
know
i
going
to
stop
hubbard
calling
me
olive
impudent
halleck
shifted
her
ground
with
the
pretence
which
women
use
even
amongst
themselves
of
having
remained
steadfast
he
is
a
very
good
oh
because
he
likes
to
be
retorted
her
daughter
nothing
is
easier
than
to
be
a
good
ah
my
dear
said
halleck
wait
till
you
have
this
made
olive
laugh
but
she
answered
with
an
argument
that
always
had
weight
with
her
mother
ben
does
think
he
a
good
what
makes
you
think
so
olive
asked
her
mother
i
know
he
dislikes
him
why
you
just
said
yourself
dear
that
he
was
friendlier
with
him
than
oh
that
nothing
the
more
he
disliked
him
the
kinder
he
would
be
to
that
true
sighed
her
mother
did
he
ever
say
anything
to
you
about
him
no
cried
olive
shortly
he
never
speaks
of
people
he
does
the
mother
returned
with
logical
severity
all
that
does
prove
that
ben
thinks
he
is
a
good
he
dislikes
him
do
you
believe
a
bad
man
can
be
a
good
husband
then
no
halleck
admitted
as
if
confronted
with
indisputable
proof
of
bartley
wickedness
in
the
mean
time
the
peace
between
bartley
and
marcia
continued
unbroken
and
these
days
of
waiting
of
suffering
of
hoping
and
dreading
were
the
happiest
of
their
lives
he
did
his
best
to
be
patient
with
her
caprices
and
fretfulness
and
he
was
at
least
manfully
comforting
and
helpful
and
instant
in
atonement
for
every
failure
she
said
a
thousand
times
that
she
should
die
without
him
and
when
her
time
came
he
thought
that
she
was
going
to
die
before
he
could
tell
her
of
his
sorrow
for
all
that
he
had
ever
done
to
grieve
her
he
did
not
tell
her
though
she
lived
to
give
him
the
chance
but
he
took
her
and
her
baby
both
into
his
arms
with
tears
of
as
much
fondness
as
ever
a
man
shed
he
even
began
his
confession
but
she
said
hush
you
never
did
a
wrong
thing
yet
that
i
did
drive
you
pale
and
faint
she
smiled
joyfully
upon
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
head
when
he
hid
his
face
against
hers
on
the
pillow
and
put
her
lips
against
his
cheek
his
heart
was
full
he
was
grateful
for
the
mercy
that
had
spared
him
he
was
so
strong
in
his
silent
repentance
that
he
felt
like
a
good
man
bartley
she
said
i
going
to
ask
a
great
favor
of
there
nothing
that
i
can
do
that
shall
think
a
favor
darling
he
cried
lifting
his
face
to
look
into
hers
write
for
mother
to
come
i
want
her
why
of
marcia
continued
to
look
at
him
and
kept
the
quivering
hold
she
had
laid
of
his
hand
when
he
raised
his
head
was
that
all
she
was
silent
and
he
added
i
will
ask
your
father
to
come
with
she
hid
her
face
for
the
space
of
one
sob
i
wanted
you
to
why
of
course
of
course
he
replied
she
did
not
acknowledge
his
magnanimity
directly
but
she
lifted
the
coverlet
and
showed
him
the
little
head
on
her
arm
and
the
little
creased
and
crumpled
face
pretty
she
asked
bring
me
the
letter
before
you
send
yes
that
is
just
right
perfect
she
sighed
when
he
came
back
and
read
the
letter
to
her
and
she
fell
away
to
happy
sleep
her
father
answered
that
he
would
come
with
her
mother
as
soon
as
he
got
the
better
of
a
cold
he
had
taken
it
was
now
well
into
the
winter
and
the
journey
must
have
seemed
more
formidable
in
equity
than
in
boston
but
bartley
was
not
impatient
of
his
delay
and
he
set
himself
cheerfully
about
consoling
marcia
for
it
she
stole
her
white
thin
hand
into
his
and
now
and
then
gave
it
a
little
pressure
to
accent
the
points
she
made
in
talking
father
was
the
first
one
i
thought
of
after
you
bartley
it
seems
to
me
as
if
baby
came
half
to
show
me
how
unfeeling
i
had
been
to
him
of
course
i
not
sorry
i
ran
away
and
asked
you
to
take
me
back
for
i
could
have
had
you
if
i
had
done
it
but
i
never
realized
before
how
cruel
it
was
to
father
he
always
made
such
a
pet
of
me
and
i
know
that
he
thought
he
was
acting
for
the
i
knew
that
were
said
bartley
fervently
what
sweet
things
you
always
say
to
me
she
murmured
but
do
you
see
bartley
that
i
did
think
enough
of
him
that
what
baby
seems
to
have
come
to
teach
she
pulled
a
little
away
on
the
pillow
so
as
to
fix
him
more
earnestly
with
her
eyes
if
baby
should
behave
so
to
when
she
grew
up
i
should
hate
her
he
laughed
and
said
well
perhaps
your
mother
hates
no
they
do
either
of
them
answered
marcia
with
a
sigh
and
i
behaved
very
stiffly
and
coldly
with
him
when
he
came
up
to
see
me
more
than
i
had
any
need
to
i
did
it
for
your
sake
but
he
did
mean
any
harm
to
you
he
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
was
safe
and
oh
that
all
right
yes
i
know
but
what
if
he
had
died
well
he
did
die
said
bartley
with
a
smile
and
you
corresponded
with
them
regularly
ever
since
and
you
know
they
been
getting
along
all
right
and
it
going
to
be
altogether
different
from
this
out
he
added
leaning
back
a
little
weary
with
a
matter
in
which
he
could
not
be
expected
to
take
a
very
cordial
interest
truly
she
asked
with
one
of
the
eagerest
of
those
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
it
is
he
replied
with
a
yawn
how
good
you
are
bartley
she
said
with
an
admiring
look
as
if
it
were
the
goodness
of
god
she
was
praising
bartley
released
himself
and
went
to
the
new
crib
in
which
the
baby
lay
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
stood
looking
down
at
it
with
a
curious
smile
is
it
pretty
she
asked
envious
of
his
view
of
the
baby
not
definitively
so
he
answered
i
dare
say
she
will
smooth
out
in
time
but
she
seems
to
be
considerably
puckered
well
returned
marcia
with
forced
resignation
i
should
let
any
one
else
say
her
husband
set
up
a
soft
low
thoughtful
whistle
i
tell
you
what
marcia
he
said
presently
suppose
we
name
this
baby
after
your
father
she
lifted
herself
on
her
elbow
and
stared
at
him
as
if
he
must
be
making
fun
of
her
why
how
could
we
she
demanded
squire
gaylord
parents
had
called
his
name
flavius
josephus
in
a
superstition
once
cherished
by
people
that
the
jewish
historian
was
somehow
a
sacred
writer
we
ca
name
her
josephus
but
we
can
call
her
flavia
said
bartley
and
if
she
makes
up
her
mind
to
turn
out
a
blonde
the
name
will
just
fit
flavia
it
a
very
pretty
he
looked
at
his
wife
who
suddenly
turned
her
face
down
on
the
pillow
bartley
hubbard
she
cried
you
the
best
man
in
the
world
oh
no
only
the
suggested
bartley
in
these
days
they
took
their
fill
of
the
delight
of
young
fatherhood
and
motherhood
after
its
morning
bath
bartley
was
called
in
and
allowed
to
revere
the
baby
mottled
and
dimpled
back
as
it
lay
face
downward
on
the
nurse
lap
feebly
wiggling
its
arms
and
legs
and
responding
with
ineffectual
little
sighs
and
gurgles
to
her
acceptable
rubbings
with
warm
flannel
when
it
was
fully
dressed
and
its
long
clothes
pulled
snugly
down
and
its
limp
person
stiffened
into
something
tenable
he
was
suffered
to
take
it
into
his
arms
and
to
walk
the
room
with
it
after
all
there
is
not
much
that
a
man
can
actually
do
with
a
small
baby
either
for
its
pleasure
or
his
own
and
barkley
usefulness
had
its
strict
limitations
he
was
perhaps
most
beneficial
when
he
put
the
child
in
its
mother
arms
and
sat
down
beside
the
bed
and
quietly
talked
while
marcia
occasionally
put
up
a
slender
hand
and
smoothed
its
golden
brown
hair
bending
her
neck
over
to
look
at
it
where
it
lay
with
the
action
of
a
mother
bird
they
examined
with
minute
interest
the
details
of
the
curious
little
creature
its
tiny
fine
and
sharp
and
its
small
queer
fist
doubled
so
tight
and
closing
on
one
finger
like
a
canary
claw
on
a
perch
the
absurdity
of
its
foot
the
absurdity
of
its
toes
the
ridiculous
inadequacy
of
its
legs
and
arms
to
the
work
ordinarily
expected
of
legs
and
arms
made
them
laugh
they
could
not
tell
yet
whether
its
eyes
would
be
black
like
marcia
or
blue
like
bartley
those
long
lashes
had
the
sweep
of
hers
but
its
mop
of
hair
which
made
it
look
so
odd
and
old
was
more
like
his
in
color
she
will
be
a
blonde
bartley
decided
is
that
nice
asked
marcia
with
the
telescope
sight
they
warranted
to
kill
at
five
hundred
oh
for
shame
bartley
to
talk
of
baby
ever
killing
why
that
what
they
all
come
to
it
what
you
came
to
yes
i
know
but
it
quite
another
thing
with
she
began
to
mumble
it
with
her
lips
and
to
talk
to
it
in
their
common
interest
in
this
puppet
they
already
called
each
other
papa
and
mamma
squire
gaylord
came
alone
and
when
marcia
greeted
him
with
why
father
where
mother
he
asked
did
you
expect
her
well
i
guess
your
feeling
rather
too
old
for
such
long
winter
journeys
you
know
she
go
out
a
great
deal
guess
she
expects
your
family
down
there
in
the
the
old
man
was
considerably
abashed
by
the
baby
when
it
was
put
into
his
arms
and
being
required
to
guess
its
name
he
naturally
failed
flavia
cried
marcia
joyfully
bartley
named
it
after
this
embarrassed
the
squire
still
more
is
that
so
he
asked
rather
sheepishly
well
it
quite
a
marcia
repeated
this
to
her
husband
as
evidence
that
her
father
was
all
right
now
bartley
and
the
squire
were
in
fact
very
civil
to
each
other
and
bartley
paid
the
old
man
many
marked
attentions
he
took
him
to
the
top
of
the
state
house
and
walked
him
all
about
the
city
to
show
him
its
points
of
interest
and
introduced
him
to
such
of
his
friends
as
they
met
though
the
squire
dresscoat
whether
fully
revealed
by
the
removal
of
his
surtout
or
betraying
itself
below
the
skirt
of
the
latter
was
a
trial
to
a
fellow
of
bartley
style
he
went
with
his
to
see
warren
in
jefferson
scattering
batkins
and
the
squire
grimly
appreciated
the
burlesque
of
the
member
from
cranberry
centre
but
he
was
otherwise
not
a
very
amusable
person
and
off
his
own
ground
he
was
not
conversable
while
he
refused
to
betray
his
impressions
of
many
things
that
bartley
expected
to
astonish
him
the
events
editorial
rooms
had
no
apparent
effect
upon
him
though
they
were
as
different
from
most
editorial
dens
as
tapestry
carpets
desks
and
swivel
chairs
could
make
them
witherby
covered
him
with
urbanities
and
praises
of
bartley
that
ought
to
have
delighted
him
as
a
but
apparently
the
great
man
of
the
events
was
but
a
strange
variety
of
the
type
with
which
he
was
familiar
in
the
despised
country
editors
he
got
on
better
with
atherton
who
was
of
a
man
profession
the
squire
wore
his
hat
throughout
their
interview
and
everywhere
except
at
table
and
in
bed
and
as
soon
as
he
rose
front
either
he
put
it
on
bartley
tried
to
impress
him
with
such
novel
traits
of
cosmopolitan
life
as
a
dinner
at
a
french
restaurant
but
the
squire
sat
through
the
courses
as
if
his
barbarous
old
appetite
had
satisfied
itself
in
that
manner
all
his
life
after
that
bartley
practically
gave
him
up
he
pleaded
his
newspaper
work
and
left
the
squire
to
pass
the
time
as
he
could
in
the
little
house
on
clover
street
where
he
sat
half
a
day
at
a
stretch
in
the
parlor
with
his
hat
on
reading
the
newspapers
his
legs
sprawled
out
towards
the
grate
in
this
way
he
probably
reconstructed
for
himself
some
image
of
his
wonted
life
in
his
office
at
home
and
was
for
the
time
at
peace
but
otherwise
he
was
very
restless
except
when
he
was
with
marcia
he
was
as
fond
of
her
in
his
way
as
he
had
ever
been
and
though
he
apparently
cared
nothing
for
the
baby
he
enjoyed
marcia
pride
in
it
and
he
bore
to
have
it
thrust
upon
him
with
the
surly
mildness
of
an
old
dog
receiving
children
caresses
he
listened
with
the
same
patience
to
all
her
celebrations
of
bartley
which
were
often
tedious
enough
for
she
bragged
of
him
constantly
of
his
smartness
and
goodness
and
of
the
great
success
that
had
crowned
the
merit
of
both
in
him
halleck
had
called
upon
the
squire
the
morning
after
his
arrival
and
brought
marcia
a
note
from
his
wife
offering
to
have
her
father
stay
with
them
if
she
found
herself
too
much
crowded
at
this
eventful
time
there
that
is
just
the
sort
of
people
the
hallecks
are
she
cried
showing
the
letter
to
her
father
and
to
think
of
our
not
going
near
them
for
months
and
mouths
after
we
came
to
boston
for
fear
they
were
stuck
up
but
bartley
is
always
just
so
proud
now
you
must
go
right
in
father
and
not
keep
halleck
waiting
give
me
your
hat
or
you
be
sure
to
wear
it
in
the
she
made
him
stoop
down
to
let
her
brush
his
a
little
there
now
you
look
something
squire
gaylord
had
never
received
a
visit
except
on
business
in
his
life
and
such
a
thing
as
one
man
calling
socially
upon
another
as
women
did
was
unknown
to
the
civilization
of
equity
but
as
he
reported
to
marcia
he
got
along
with
halleck
and
he
got
along
with
the
whole
family
when
he
went
with
bartley
to
tea
upon
the
invitation
halleck
made
him
that
morning
probably
it
appeared
to
him
an
objectless
hospitality
but
he
spent
as
pleasant
an
evening
as
he
could
hope
to
spend
with
his
hat
off
and
in
a
which
he
wore
as
a
more
ceremonious
garment
than
the
of
his
life
he
seemed
to
take
a
special
liking
to
olive
halleck
whose
habit
of
speaking
her
mind
with
vigor
and
directness
struck
him
as
commendable
it
was
olive
who
made
the
time
pass
for
him
and
as
the
occasion
was
not
one
for
personal
sarcasm
or
question
of
the
christian
religion
her
task
in
keeping
the
old
pagan
out
of
rather
abysmal
silences
must
have
had
its
difficulties
what
did
you
talk
about
asked
marcia
requiring
an
account
of
his
enjoyment
from
him
the
next
morning
after
bartley
had
gone
down
to
his
work
mostly
about
you
i
guess
said
the
squire
with
a
laugh
there
was
a
large
young
woman
there
miss
kingsbury
said
marcia
with
vindictive
promptness
her
eyes
kindled
and
she
began
to
grow
rigid
under
the
coverlet
whom
did
talk
with
well
she
talked
a
little
with
me
but
she
talked
most
of
the
time
to
the
young
man
she
engaged
to
him
no
said
marcia
relaxing
she
a
great
friend
of
the
whole
family
i
do
know
what
they
meant
by
telling
you
it
was
to
be
just
a
family
party
when
they
were
going
to
have
strangers
in
she
pouted
perhaps
they
did
count
but
marcia
pleasure
in
the
affair
was
tainted
and
she
began
to
talk
of
other
things
her
father
stayed
nearly
a
week
and
they
all
found
it
rather
a
long
week
after
showing
him
her
baby
and
satisfying
herself
that
he
and
bartley
were
on
good
terms
again
there
was
not
much
left
for
marcia
bartley
had
been
banished
to
the
spare
room
by
the
presence
of
the
nurse
and
he
gave
up
his
bed
there
to
the
squire
and
slept
on
a
cot
in
the
unfurnished
attic
room
the
cook
and
a
small
girl
got
in
to
help
had
the
other
the
house
that
had
once
seemed
so
vast
was
full
to
bursting
i
never
knew
how
little
it
was
till
i
saw
your
father
coming
down
stairs
said
bartley
he
too
tall
for
it
when
he
sits
on
the
sofa
and
stretches
out
his
legs
his
boots
touch
the
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
fact
he
wo
stay
over
sunday
began
marcia
with
a
rueful
smile
why
marcia
you
do
think
i
want
him
to
go
no
you
as
good
as
can
be
about
it
but
i
hope
he
wo
stay
over
have
you
enjoyed
his
visit
asked
bartley
oh
yes
i
enjoyed
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
i
made
it
all
up
with
father
and
he
does
feel
hard
to
me
but
bartley
sit
down
dear
here
on
the
bed
she
took
his
hand
and
gently
pulled
him
down
i
see
more
and
more
that
father
and
mother
can
never
be
what
they
used
to
be
to
me
that
you
all
the
world
to
me
yes
my
life
is
broken
off
from
theirs
forever
could
anything
break
it
off
from
yours
you
always
be
patient
with
me
wo
you
and
remember
that
i
always
rather
be
good
when
i
behaving
the
worst
he
rose
and
went
over
to
the
crib
and
kissed
the
head
of
their
little
girl
ask
flavia
he
said
from
the
door
bartley
she
cried
in
utter
fondness
as
he
vanished
from
her
happy
eyes
the
next
morning
they
heard
the
squire
moving
about
in
his
room
and
he
was
late
in
coming
down
to
breakfast
at
which
he
was
ordinarily
so
prompt
he
packing
said
marcia
sadly
it
dreadful
to
be
willing
to
have
him
go
bartley
went
out
and
met
him
at
his
door
bag
in
hand
hollo
he
cried
and
made
a
decent
show
of
surprise
and
regret
said
the
old
man
as
they
went
down
stairs
i
made
out
a
visit
but
i
an
old
fellow
and
i
ai
easy
away
from
home
i
shall
tell
mis
gaylord
how
you
gettin
along
and
she
be
pleased
to
hear
it
yes
she
be
pleased
to
hear
it
i
guess
i
shall
get
off
on
the
the
conversation
between
bartley
and
his
was
perfunctory
men
who
have
dealt
so
plainly
with
each
other
do
not
assume
the
conventional
urbanities
in
their
intercourse
without
effort
they
had
both
been
growing
more
impatient
of
the
restraint
they
could
not
have
kept
it
up
much
longer
well
i
suppose
it
natural
you
should
want
to
be
home
again
but
i
ca
understand
how
any
one
can
want
to
go
back
to
equity
when
he
has
the
privilege
of
staying
in
boston
will
do
for
a
young
man
said
the
squire
but
i
too
old
for
it
the
city
cramps
me
it
too
tight
a
fit
and
yet
i
ca
seem
to
find
myself
in
he
suffered
from
the
loss
of
identity
which
is
a
common
affliction
with
country
people
coming
to
town
the
feeling
that
they
are
of
no
special
interest
to
any
of
the
thousands
they
meet
bewilders
and
harasses
them
after
the
searching
neighborhood
of
village
life
the
fact
that
nobody
would
meddle
in
their
most
intimate
affairs
if
they
could
is
a
vague
distress
the
squire
not
only
experienced
this
but
after
reigning
so
long
as
the
censor
of
morals
and
religion
in
equity
it
was
a
deprivation
for
him
to
pass
a
whole
week
without
saying
a
bitter
thing
to
any
one
he
was
tired
of
the
civilities
that
smoothed
him
down
on
every
side
well
if
you
must
go
said
bartley
i
order
a
i
guess
i
can
walk
to
the
depot
returned
the
old
man
oh
no
you
bartley
drove
to
the
station
with
him
and
they
bade
each
other
adieu
with
a
they
were
no
longer
enemies
but
they
liked
each
other
less
than
ever
see
you
in
equity
next
summer
i
suppose
suggested
the
squire
so
marcia
says
replied
bartley
well
take
care
of
you
confounded
old
woodchuck
he
added
under
his
breath
for
the
squire
had
allowed
him
to
pay
the
hack
fare
he
walked
home
composing
variations
on
his
parting
malison
to
find
that
the
squire
had
profited
by
his
brief
absence
while
ordering
the
hack
to
leave
with
marcia
a
silver
cup
knife
fork
and
spoon
which
olive
halleck
had
helped
him
choose
for
the
baby
in
the
cup
was
a
check
for
five
hundred
dollars
the
squire
was
embarrassed
in
presenting
the
gifts
and
when
marcia
turned
upon
him
with
now
look
here
father
what
do
you
mean
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
explain
well
it
what
i
always
meant
to
do
for
baby
things
are
all
right
said
marcia
but
i
not
going
to
let
bartley
take
any
money
from
you
unless
you
think
as
well
of
him
as
i
do
and
say
so
right
the
squire
laughed
you
could
quite
expect
me
to
do
that
could
you
no
of
course
not
but
what
i
mean
is
do
you
think
that
i
did
right
to
marry
him
oh
all
right
marcia
i
glad
you
getting
along
so
no
no
is
bartley
all
right
the
squire
laughed
again
and
rubbed
his
chin
in
enjoyment
of
her
persistence
you
ca
expect
me
to
own
up
to
everything
all
at
so
you
see
bartley
said
marcia
in
repeating
these
words
to
him
it
was
quite
a
well
i
do
know
about
the
concession
but
i
guess
there
no
doubt
about
the
check
replied
bartley
oh
do
say
that
dear
protested
his
wife
i
think
father
was
pleased
with
his
visit
every
way
i
know
he
been
anxious
about
me
all
the
time
and
yet
it
was
a
good
deal
for
him
to
do
after
what
he
had
said
to
come
down
here
and
as
much
as
take
it
all
back
ca
you
look
at
it
from
his
side
oh
i
dare
say
it
was
a
dose
bartley
admitted
the
money
had
set
several
things
in
a
better
light
if
all
the
people
that
have
abused
me
would
take
it
back
as
handsomely
as
your
father
has
he
held
the
check
up
why
i
wish
there
were
twice
as
many
of
she
laughed
for
pleasure
in
his
joke
i
think
father
was
impressed
by
everything
about
us
beginning
with
baby
she
said
proudly
well
he
kept
his
impressions
to
oh
that
nothing
but
his
way
he
never
was
demonstrative
like
no
he
has
his
emotions
under
control
not
to
say
under
lock
and
key
not
to
add
in
bartley
went
on
to
give
some
instances
of
the
squire
fortitude
when
apparently
tempted
to
express
pleasure
or
interest
in
his
boston
experiences
they
both
undeniably
felt
freer
now
that
he
was
gone
bartley
stayed
longer
than
he
ought
from
his
work
in
tacit
celebration
of
the
departure
and
they
were
very
merry
together
but
when
he
left
her
marcia
called
for
her
baby
and
gathering
it
close
to
her
heart
sighed
over
it
poor
father
poor
father
xxiii
when
the
spring
opened
bartley
pushed
flavia
about
the
sunny
pavements
in
a
baby
carriage
while
marcia
paced
alongside
looking
in
under
the
calash
top
from
time
to
time
arranging
the
bright
afghan
and
twitching
the
little
one
lace
hood
into
place
they
never
noticed
that
other
perambulators
were
pushed
by
irish
or
french
they
had
paid
somewhat
more
than
they
ought
for
theirs
and
they
were
proud
of
it
merely
as
a
piece
of
property
it
was
rather
bartley
ideal
as
it
is
that
of
most
young
american
fathers
to
go
out
with
his
wife
and
baby
in
that
way
he
liked
to
have
his
friends
see
him
and
he
went
out
every
afternoon
he
could
spare
when
he
could
not
go
marcia
went
alone
halleck
had
given
her
a
key
to
the
garden
and
on
pleasant
mornings
she
always
found
some
of
the
family
there
when
she
pushed
the
perambulator
up
the
path
to
let
the
baby
sleep
in
the
warmth
and
silence
of
the
sheltered
place
she
chatted
with
olive
or
the
elder
sisters
while
halleck
drove
cyrus
on
to
the
work
of
tying
up
the
vines
and
trimming
the
shrubs
with
the
pitiless
rigor
of
women
when
they
get
a
man
about
some
outdoor
labor
sometimes
ben
halleck
was
briefly
of
the
party
and
one
morning
when
marcia
opened
the
gate
she
found
him
there
alone
with
cyrus
who
was
busy
at
some
belated
tasks
of
horticulture
the
young
man
turned
at
the
unlocking
of
the
gate
and
saw
marcia
lifting
the
front
wheels
of
the
perambulator
to
get
it
over
the
steps
of
the
pavement
outside
he
limped
hastily
down
the
walk
to
help
her
but
she
had
the
carriage
in
the
path
before
he
could
reach
her
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
back
at
its
side
as
she
propelled
it
towards
the
house
you
see
what
a
useless
creature
a
cripple
is
he
said
marcia
did
not
seem
to
have
heard
him
is
your
mother
at
home
she
asked
i
think
she
is
said
halleck
cyrus
go
in
and
tell
mother
that
hubbard
is
here
wo
you
cyrus
went
after
a
moment
of
delay
and
marcia
sat
down
on
a
bench
under
a
beside
the
walk
its
narrow
young
leaves
and
blossoms
sprinkled
her
with
shade
shot
with
vivid
sunshine
and
in
her
light
dress
she
looked
like
a
bright
fresh
figure
from
some
study
of
spring
she
breathed
quickly
from
her
exertion
and
her
cheeks
had
a
rich
dewy
bloom
she
had
pulled
the
perambulator
round
so
that
she
might
see
her
baby
while
she
waited
and
she
looked
at
the
baby
now
and
not
at
halleck
as
she
said
it
is
quite
hot
in
the
sun
she
had
a
way
of
closing
her
lips
after
speaking
in
that
sweet
smile
of
hers
and
then
of
glancing
sidelong
at
the
person
to
whom
she
spoke
i
suppose
it
is
said
halleck
who
remained
on
foot
but
i
have
been
out
yet
i
gave
myself
a
day
off
from
the
law
school
and
i
had
quite
decided
what
to
do
with
marcia
leaned
forward
and
brushed
a
tendril
of
the
baby
hair
out
of
its
eye
she
the
greatest
little
sleeper
that
ever
was
when
she
gets
into
her
carriage
she
half
mused
leaning
back
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
setting
her
head
on
one
side
for
the
effect
of
the
baby
without
the
stray
ringlet
she
getting
so
fat
she
said
proudly
halleck
smiled
do
you
find
it
makes
a
difference
in
pushing
her
carriage
from
day
to
day
marcia
took
his
question
in
earnest
as
she
must
take
anything
but
the
most
obvious
pleasantry
concerning
her
baby
the
carriage
runs
very
easily
we
picked
out
the
lightest
one
we
could
and
i
never
have
any
trouble
with
it
except
getting
up
curbstones
and
crossing
cambridge
street
i
do
like
to
cross
cambridge
street
there
are
always
so
many
but
it
all
coming
here
that
one
good
that
makes
it
a
very
bad
thing
going
home
though
said
halleck
oh
i
go
round
by
charles
street
and
come
up
the
hill
from
the
other
side
it
is
so
steep
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
upon
this
point
and
in
the
lapse
of
their
talk
halleck
broke
off
some
boughs
of
the
blooming
pear
and
dropped
them
on
the
baby
afghan
your
mother
wo
like
your
spoiling
her
said
marcia
seriously
she
will
when
she
knows
that
i
did
it
for
miss
miss
hubbard
repeated
the
young
mother
and
she
laughed
in
fond
derision
how
funny
to
hear
you
saying
that
i
thought
you
hated
babies
halleck
looked
at
her
with
strong
and
he
dropped
the
bough
which
he
had
in
his
hand
upon
the
ground
there
is
something
in
a
young
man
ideal
of
women
at
once
passionate
and
ascetic
so
fine
that
any
words
are
too
gross
for
it
the
event
which
intensified
the
interest
of
his
mother
and
sisters
in
marcia
had
abashed
halleck
when
she
came
so
proudly
to
show
her
baby
to
them
all
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
mockery
of
his
pity
for
her
captivity
to
the
love
that
profaned
her
he
went
out
of
the
room
in
angry
impatience
which
he
could
hardly
hide
when
one
of
his
sisters
tried
to
make
him
take
the
baby
little
by
little
his
compassion
adjusted
itself
to
the
new
conditions
it
accepted
the
child
as
an
element
of
her
misery
in
the
future
when
she
must
realize
the
hideous
deformity
of
her
marriage
his
prophetic
feeling
of
this
and
of
her
inaccessibility
to
human
help
here
and
hereafter
made
him
sometimes
afraid
of
her
but
all
the
more
severely
he
exacted
of
his
ideal
of
her
that
she
should
not
fall
beneath
the
tragic
dignity
of
her
fate
through
any
levity
of
her
own
now
at
her
innocent
laugh
a
subtile
irreverence
which
he
was
not
able
to
exorcise
infused
itself
into
his
sense
of
her
he
stood
looking
at
her
after
he
dropped
the
and
seeing
her
mere
beauty
as
he
had
never
seen
it
before
the
bees
hummed
in
the
blossoms
which
gave
out
a
dull
sweet
smell
the
sunshine
had
the
luxurious
enervating
warmth
of
spring
he
started
suddenly
from
his
reverie
marcia
had
said
something
i
beg
your
pardon
he
queried
oh
nothing
i
asked
if
you
knew
where
i
went
to
church
yesterday
halleck
flushed
ashamed
of
the
wrong
his
thoughts
or
rather
his
emotions
had
done
no
i
do
he
answered
i
was
at
your
i
ought
to
have
been
there
myself
he
returned
gravely
and
then
i
should
have
she
took
his
literally
you
could
have
seen
me
i
was
sitting
pretty
far
back
and
i
went
out
before
any
of
your
family
saw
me
do
you
go
there
not
always
i
sorry
to
say
or
rather
i
sorry
not
to
be
sorry
what
church
do
you
generally
go
to
oh
i
do
know
sometimes
to
one
and
sometimes
to
another
bartley
used
to
report
the
sermons
and
we
went
round
to
all
the
churches
then
that
is
the
way
i
did
at
home
and
it
came
natural
to
me
but
i
do
like
it
very
well
i
want
flavia
should
belong
to
some
particular
there
are
enough
to
choose
from
said
halleck
with
pensive
sarcasm
yes
that
the
difficulty
but
i
shall
make
up
my
mind
to
one
of
them
and
then
i
shall
always
keep
to
it
what
i
mean
is
that
i
should
like
to
find
out
where
most
of
the
good
people
belong
and
then
have
her
be
with
them
pursued
marcia
i
think
it
best
to
belong
to
some
church
you
there
was
something
so
bare
so
spiritually
in
these
confessions
and
questions
that
halleck
found
nothing
to
say
to
them
he
was
troubled
moreover
as
to
what
the
truth
was
in
his
own
mind
he
answered
with
a
sort
of
mechanical
adhesion
to
the
teachings
of
his
youth
i
should
be
a
recreant
not
to
think
so
but
i
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
by
belonging
to
some
church
he
added
i
suppose
you
would
want
to
believe
in
the
creed
of
the
church
whichever
it
i
do
know
that
i
should
be
particular
said
marcia
with
perfect
honesty
halleck
laughed
sadly
i
afraid
would
then
unless
you
joined
the
broad
what
is
that
he
explained
as
well
as
he
could
at
the
end
she
repeated
as
if
she
had
not
followed
him
very
closely
i
should
like
her
to
belong
to
the
church
where
most
of
the
good
people
went
i
think
that
would
be
the
right
one
if
you
could
only
find
which
it
halleck
laughed
again
i
suppose
what
i
say
must
sound
very
queer
to
you
but
i
been
thinking
a
good
deal
about
this
i
beg
your
pardon
said
halleck
i
had
no
reason
to
laugh
either
on
your
account
or
my
own
it
a
serious
she
did
not
reply
and
he
asked
as
if
she
had
left
the
subject
do
you
intend
to
pass
the
summer
in
boston
no
i
going
down
home
pretty
early
and
i
wanted
to
ask
your
mother
what
is
the
best
way
to
put
away
my
winter
you
find
my
mother
very
good
authority
on
such
matters
said
halleck
through
an
obscure
association
with
moths
that
corrupt
he
added
she
a
good
authority
on
church
matters
i
guess
i
shall
talk
with
her
about
flavia
said
marcia
cyrus
came
out
of
the
house
mis
halleck
will
be
here
in
a
minute
got
to
get
red
of
a
lady
that
calling
first
he
explained
i
will
leave
you
then
said
halleck
abruptly
good
by
answered
marcia
tranquilly
the
baby
stirred
she
pushed
the
carriage
to
and
fro
without
glancing
after
him
as
he
walked
away
his
mother
came
down
the
steps
from
the
house
and
kissed
marcia
for
welcome
and
looked
under
the
at
the
sleeping
baby
how
she
sleep
she
whispered
yes
said
marcia
with
the
proud
humility
of
a
mother
who
can
not
deny
the
merit
of
her
child
and
she
sleeps
the
whole
night
through
up
with
her
bartley
says
she
a
perfect
it
a
regular
joke
with
him
her
ben
was
a
good
baby
for
sleeping
too
said
halleck
retrospectively
emulous
it
one
of
the
best
signs
it
shows
that
the
child
is
strong
and
they
went
on
to
talk
of
their
children
and
in
their
community
of
motherhood
they
spoke
of
the
young
man
as
if
he
were
still
an
infant
he
has
never
been
a
moment
care
to
me
said
halleck
a
well
baby
will
be
well
even
in
and
i
had
somehow
thought
of
him
as
sickly
said
marcia
in
tears
of
instant
intelligence
sprang
into
his
mother
eyes
and
did
you
suppose
he
was
lame
she
demanded
with
gentle
indignation
he
was
the
brightest
and
strongest
boy
that
ever
was
till
he
was
twelve
years
old
that
what
makes
it
so
hard
to
bear
that
what
makes
me
wonder
at
the
way
the
child
bears
it
did
you
never
hear
how
it
happened
one
of
the
big
boys
as
he
called
him
tripped
him
up
at
school
and
he
fell
on
his
hip
it
kept
him
in
bed
for
a
year
and
he
never
been
the
same
since
he
will
always
be
a
cripple
grieved
the
mother
she
wiped
her
eyes
she
never
could
think
of
her
boy
infirmity
without
weeping
and
what
seemed
the
worst
of
all
she
continued
was
that
the
boy
who
did
it
never
expressed
any
regret
for
it
or
acknowledged
it
by
word
or
deed
though
he
must
have
known
that
ben
knew
who
hurt
him
he
a
man
here
now
and
sometimes
ben
meets
him
but
ben
always
says
that
he
can
stand
it
if
the
other
one
can
he
was
always
just
so
from
the
first
he
would
let
us
blame
the
boy
he
said
that
he
did
mean
any
harm
and
that
all
was
fair
in
play
and
now
he
says
he
knows
the
man
is
sorry
and
would
own
to
what
he
did
if
he
did
have
to
own
to
what
came
of
it
ben
says
that
very
few
of
us
have
the
courage
to
face
the
consequences
of
the
injuries
we
do
and
that
what
makes
people
seem
hard
and
indifferent
when
they
are
really
not
so
there
cried
halleck
i
do
know
as
i
ought
to
have
told
you
about
it
i
know
ben
would
like
it
but
i
ca
bear
to
have
any
one
think
he
was
always
lame
though
i
do
know
why
i
should
i
prouder
of
him
since
it
happened
than
ever
i
was
before
i
thought
he
was
here
with
you
she
added
abruptly
he
went
out
just
before
you
came
said
marcia
nodding
toward
the
gate
she
sat
listening
to
halleck
talk
about
ben
halleck
took
herself
to
task
from
time
to
time
but
only
to
go
on
talking
about
him
again
sometimes
marcia
commented
on
his
characteristics
and
compared
them
with
bartley
or
with
flavia
according
to
the
period
of
ben
life
under
consideration
at
the
end
halleck
said
i
have
let
you
get
in
a
word
now
you
must
talk
about
baby
dear
little
thing
i
feel
that
she
been
neglected
but
i
always
just
so
selfish
when
i
get
to
running
on
about
ben
they
all
laugh
at
oh
i
like
to
hear
about
other
children
said
marcia
turning
the
perambulator
round
i
do
think
any
one
can
know
too
much
that
has
the
care
of
children
of
their
she
added
as
if
it
followed
from
something
they
had
been
saying
of
vaccination
mrs
halleck
i
want
to
talk
with
you
about
getting
flavia
christened
you
know
i
never
was
were
you
said
halleck
with
a
dismay
which
she
struggled
to
conceal
no
said
marcia
father
does
believe
in
any
of
those
things
and
mother
had
got
to
letting
them
go
because
he
did
take
any
interest
in
them
they
did
have
the
first
children
christened
but
i
was
the
i
did
speak
with
your
father
on
the
subject
faltered
halleck
i
did
know
what
his
persuasion
why
father
does
belong
to
church
he
believes
in
a
god
but
he
does
believe
in
the
halleck
sank
down
on
the
garden
seat
too
much
shocked
to
speak
and
marcia
continued
i
do
know
whether
the
bible
is
true
or
not
but
i
often
wished
that
i
belonged
to
you
could
unless
you
believed
in
the
bible
said
halleck
yes
i
know
that
perhaps
i
should
if
anybody
proved
it
to
me
i
presume
it
could
be
explained
i
never
talked
much
with
any
one
about
it
there
must
be
a
good
many
people
who
do
belong
to
church
although
they
believe
in
the
bible
i
should
be
perfectly
willing
to
try
if
i
only
knew
how
to
in
view
of
this
ruinous
halleck
could
only
say
the
way
to
begin
is
to
read
well
i
will
try
how
do
you
know
after
you
become
so
that
you
believe
the
bible
whether
you
fit
to
join
the
church
it
hard
to
tell
you
my
dear
you
have
to
feel
first
that
you
have
a
saviour
that
you
given
your
whole
heart
to
him
that
he
can
save
you
and
that
no
one
else
can
that
all
you
can
do
yourself
wo
help
you
it
an
marcia
looked
at
her
attentively
as
if
this
were
all
a
very
hard
saying
yes
i
heard
of
that
some
of
the
girls
had
it
at
school
but
i
never
did
well
she
said
at
last
i
do
feel
so
anxious
about
myself
just
at
present
as
i
do
about
flavia
i
want
to
do
everything
i
can
for
flavia
halleck
i
want
her
to
be
christened
i
want
her
to
be
baptized
into
some
church
i
think
a
good
deal
about
it
i
think
sometimes
what
if
she
should
die
and
i
had
done
that
for
her
when
may
be
it
was
one
of
the
most
important
things
her
voice
shook
and
she
pressed
her
lips
together
of
course
said
halleck
tenderly
i
think
it
is
the
important
but
there
are
so
many
churches
marcia
resumed
and
i
do
know
about
any
of
them
i
told
halleck
just
now
that
i
should
like
her
to
belong
to
the
church
where
the
best
people
went
if
i
could
find
it
out
of
course
it
was
a
ridiculous
way
to
talk
i
knew
he
thought
so
but
what
i
meant
was
that
i
wanted
she
should
be
with
good
people
all
her
life
and
i
did
care
what
she
it
very
important
to
believe
the
truth
my
dear
said
halleck
but
the
truth
is
so
hard
to
be
certain
of
and
you
know
goodness
as
soon
as
you
see
it
halleck
i
tell
you
what
i
want
i
want
flavia
should
be
baptized
into
your
church
will
you
let
her
her
o
my
dear
child
we
shall
be
humbly
thankful
that
it
has
been
put
into
your
heart
to
choose
for
her
what
think
is
the
true
church
said
halleck
fervently
i
do
know
about
that
returned
marcia
i
ca
tell
whether
it
the
true
church
or
not
and
i
do
know
that
i
ever
could
but
i
shall
be
satisfied
if
it
made
you
what
you
are
she
added
simply
halleck
did
not
try
to
turn
away
her
praise
with
vain
affectations
of
humility
we
try
to
do
right
marcia
she
said
whenever
we
do
it
we
must
be
helped
to
it
by
some
power
outside
of
ourselves
i
ca
tell
you
whether
it
our
church
i
not
so
sure
of
that
as
i
used
to
be
i
once
thought
that
there
could
be
no
real
good
out
of
it
but
i
think
that
any
more
olive
and
ben
are
as
good
children
as
ever
lived
i
they
wo
be
lost
but
neither
of
them
belongs
to
our
why
what
church
does
he
belong
to
he
does
belong
to
any
my
dear
said
halleck
sorrowfully
marcia
looked
at
her
absently
i
knew
olive
was
a
unitarian
but
i
thought
i
thought
he
no
he
does
returned
halleck
it
has
been
a
great
cross
to
his
father
and
me
he
is
a
good
boy
but
we
think
the
is
in
our
church
marcia
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
decisively
well
i
should
like
flavia
to
belong
to
your
she
could
belong
to
it
now
halleck
explained
that
would
have
to
come
later
when
she
could
understand
but
she
could
be
christened
in
it
dear
little
thing
well
christened
then
it
must
be
the
training
he
got
in
it
i
thought
a
great
deal
about
it
and
i
think
my
worst
trouble
is
that
i
been
left
too
free
in
everything
one
must
be
left
too
free
i
never
had
any
one
to
control
me
and
now
i
ca
control
myself
at
the
very
times
when
i
need
to
do
it
the
most
with
with
when
i
in
danger
of
vexing
when
bartley
and
i
yes
said
halleck
sympathetically
and
bartley
is
just
so
too
he
always
been
left
to
himself
and
flavia
will
need
all
the
control
we
can
give
her
i
know
she
will
and
i
shall
have
her
christened
in
your
church
and
i
shall
teach
her
all
about
it
she
shall
go
to
the
sunday
school
and
i
will
go
to
church
so
that
she
can
have
an
example
i
told
father
i
should
do
it
when
he
was
up
here
and
he
said
there
could
be
any
harm
in
it
and
i
told
bartley
and
does
they
were
both
far
too
and
too
serious
to
find
anything
droll
in
the
terms
of
the
adhesion
of
marcia
family
to
her
plan
and
halleck
entered
into
its
execution
with
affectionate
zeal
ben
dear
she
said
tenderly
that
evening
when
they
were
all
talking
it
over
in
the
family
council
i
hope
you
did
drop
anything
when
that
poor
creature
spoke
to
you
about
it
this
morning
that
could
unsettle
her
mind
in
any
way
no
mother
said
halleck
gently
i
was
sure
you
did
returned
his
mother
repentantly
they
had
been
talking
a
long
time
of
the
matter
and
halleck
now
left
the
room
mother
how
could
you
say
such
a
thing
to
ben
cried
olive
in
a
quiver
of
indignant
sympathy
ben
say
anything
to
unsettle
anybody
religious
purposes
he
got
more
religion
now
than
all
the
rest
of
the
family
put
together
speak
for
yourself
olive
said
one
of
the
intermediary
sisters
why
olive
i
spoke
because
i
thought
she
seemed
to
place
more
importance
on
ben
belonging
to
the
church
than
anything
else
and
she
seemed
so
surprised
when
i
told
her
he
did
belong
to
i
dare
say
she
thinks
ben
is
good
when
she
compares
him
with
that
mass
of
selfishness
of
a
husband
of
hers
said
olive
but
i
will
thank
her
she
added
hotly
not
to
compare
ben
with
bartley
hubbard
even
to
bartley
hubbard
disadvantage
i
do
feel
flattered
by
of
course
she
thinks
all
the
world
of
her
husband
said
halleck
and
i
know
ben
is
good
and
as
you
say
he
is
religious
i
feel
that
though
i
do
understand
how
exactly
i
would
hurt
his
feelings
for
the
world
olive
you
know
well
enough
but
it
was
a
when
i
had
to
tell
that
poor
pretty
young
thing
that
ben
did
belong
to
church
and
i
could
see
that
it
puzzled
her
i
could
have
believed
continued
halleck
that
there
was
any
person
in
a
christian
land
except
among
the
very
lowest
that
seemed
to
understand
so
little
about
the
christian
religion
or
any
scheme
of
salvation
really
she
talked
to
me
like
a
pagan
she
sat
there
much
better
dressed
and
better
educated
than
i
was
but
i
felt
like
a
missionary
talking
to
a
south
sea
i
wonder
the
old
bartlett
pear
did
burst
into
a
over
your
heads
said
olive
halleck
looked
grieved
at
her
levity
and
olive
hastened
to
add
do
take
it
to
heart
mother
i
understood
just
what
you
meant
and
i
can
imagine
just
how
shocking
hubbard
heathen
remarks
must
have
been
we
should
all
be
shocked
if
we
knew
how
many
people
there
were
like
her
and
we
should
all
try
to
deny
it
and
so
would
they
i
guess
christianity
is
about
as
uncommon
as
civilization
and
that
uncommon
if
her
poor
feeble
mind
was
such
a
chaos
what
do
you
suppose
her
husband
is
this
would
certainly
not
have
been
easy
for
halleck
to
say
then
or
to
say
afterward
when
bartley
walked
up
to
the
font
in
her
church
with
marcia
at
his
side
and
flavia
in
his
arms
and
a
faintly
ironical
smile
on
his
face
as
if
he
had
never
expected
to
be
got
in
for
this
but
was
going
to
see
it
through
now
he
had
in
fact
said
well
let
go
the
whole
figure
when
marcia
had
expressed
a
preference
for
having
the
rite
performed
in
church
instead
of
in
their
own
house
he
was
unquestionably
growing
stout
and
even
halleck
noticed
that
his
blonde
face
was
unpleasantly
red
that
day
he
was
of
course
not
intemperate
he
always
had
beer
with
his
lunch
which
he
had
begun
to
take
down
town
since
the
warm
weather
had
come
on
and
made
the
walk
up
the
hill
to
clover
street
irksome
and
he
drank
beer
at
his
dinner
he
liked
a
late
dinner
and
they
dined
at
six
now
because
it
washed
away
the
fatigues
of
the
day
and
freshened
you
up
he
was
rather
particular
about
his
beer
which
he
had
sent
in
by
the
gross
it
came
cheaper
that
way
after
trying
both
the
cincinnati
and
the
milwaukee
lagers
and
making
a
cursory
test
of
the
boston
brand
he
had
settled
down
upon
the
american
tivoli
it
was
cheap
and
you
could
drink
a
couple
of
bottles
without
feeling
it
freshened
up
by
his
two
bottles
he
was
apt
to
spend
the
evening
in
an
amiable
drowse
and
get
early
to
bed
when
he
did
not
go
out
on
newspaper
duty
he
joked
about
the
three
fingers
of
fat
on
his
ribs
and
frankly
guessed
it
was
the
beer
that
did
it
at
such
times
he
said
that
perhaps
he
should
have
to
cut
down
on
his
tivoli
marcia
and
he
had
not
so
much
time
together
as
they
used
to
have
she
was
a
great
deal
taken
up
with
the
baby
and
he
found
it
dull
at
home
not
doing
anything
or
saying
anything
and
when
he
did
not
feel
sleepy
he
sometimes
invented
work
that
took
him
out
at
night
but
he
always
came
upstairs
after
putting
his
hat
on
and
asked
marcia
if
he
could
help
her
about
anything
he
usually
met
other
newspaper
men
on
these
excursions
and
talked
newspaper
with
them
airing
his
favorite
theories
he
liked
to
wander
about
with
reporters
who
were
working
up
cases
to
look
in
at
the
police
stations
and
go
to
the
fires
and
he
was
often
able
to
give
the
events
men
points
that
had
escaped
the
other
reporters
if
asked
to
drink
he
always
said
thanks
no
i
do
do
anything
in
that
way
but
if
you
make
it
beer
i
do
he
took
nothing
but
beer
when
he
hurried
out
of
the
theatre
into
one
of
the
neighboring
resorts
just
as
the
great
platters
of
stewed
kidneys
and
lyonnaise
potatoes
came
steaming
up
out
of
the
kitchen
prompt
to
the
drop
of
the
curtain
on
the
last
act
here
sometimes
he
met
a
friend
and
shared
with
him
his
dish
of
kidneys
and
his
schooner
of
beer
and
he
once
suffered
himself
to
be
lured
by
the
click
of
the
balls
into
the
back
room
he
believed
that
he
played
a
very
good
game
of
billiards
but
he
was
badly
beaten
that
night
he
came
home
at
daylight
fifty
dollars
out
but
he
had
lost
like
a
gentleman
in
a
game
with
gentlemen
and
he
never
played
again
by
day
he
worked
hard
and
since
his
expenses
had
been
increased
by
flavia
coming
he
had
undertaken
more
work
for
more
pay
he
still
performed
all
the
routine
labor
of
a
managing
editor
and
he
now
wrote
the
literary
notices
of
the
events
and
sometimes
especially
if
there
was
anything
new
the
dramatic
criticisms
he
brought
to
the
latter
task
all
the
freshness
of
a
man
who
till
the
year
before
had
not
been
half
a
dozen
times
inside
a
theatre
he
attributed
the
fat
on
his
ribs
to
the
tivoli
perhaps
it
was
also
owing
in
some
degree
to
a
good
conscience
which
is
a
much
easier
thing
to
keep
than
people
imagine
at
any
rate
he
now
led
a
tranquil
industrious
and
regular
life
and
a
life
which
suited
him
so
well
that
he
was
reluctant
to
interrupt
it
by
the
visit
to
equity
which
he
and
marcia
had
talked
of
in
the
early
spring
he
put
it
off
from
time
to
time
and
one
day
when
she
was
pressing
him
to
fix
some
date
for
it
he
said
why
ca
you
go
marcia
alone
she
faltered
well
no
take
the
baby
of
course
and
i
run
down
for
a
day
or
two
when
i
get
a
marcia
seemed
in
these
days
to
be
schooling
herself
against
the
impulses
that
once
brought
on
her
quarrels
with
bartley
a
day
or
two
she
began
and
then
stopped
and
added
gravely
i
thought
you
said
you
were
going
to
have
several
weeks
oh
do
tell
me
what
i
cried
bartley
that
was
before
i
undertook
this
extra
work
or
before
i
knew
what
a
grind
it
was
going
to
be
equity
is
a
good
deal
of
a
dose
for
me
any
way
it
all
well
enough
for
you
and
i
guess
the
change
from
boston
will
do
you
good
and
do
the
baby
good
but
should
look
forward
to
three
weeks
in
equity
with
unmitigated
i
know
it
will
be
stupid
for
you
but
you
need
the
rest
and
the
hallecks
are
going
to
be
at
north
conway
and
they
said
they
would
come
over
urged
marcia
i
know
we
should
have
a
good
bartley
grinned
is
that
your
idea
of
a
good
time
marsh
three
weeks
of
equity
relieved
by
a
visit
from
such
heavy
weights
as
ben
halleck
and
his
sisters
not
any
in
mine
thank
how
can
you
how
you
speak
of
them
so
cried
marcia
lightening
upon
him
such
good
friends
of
yours
such
good
people
her
voice
shook
with
indignation
and
wounded
feeling
bartley
rose
and
took
a
turn
about
the
room
pulling
down
his
waistcoat
and
contemplating
its
outward
slope
with
a
smile
oh
i
got
more
friends
than
i
can
shake
a
stick
at
and
with
pleasure
at
the
helm
goodness
is
a
drug
in
the
market
if
you
excuse
the
mixed
metaphor
look
here
marcia
he
added
severely
if
you
like
the
hallecks
all
well
and
good
i
interfere
with
you
but
they
bore
me
i
outgrew
ben
halleck
years
ago
he
duller
than
death
as
for
the
old
people
there
no
harm
in
them
though
bores
too
nor
in
the
old
girls
but
olive
halleck
does
treat
me
decently
i
suppose
that
just
suits
you
noticed
that
you
never
like
the
women
that
treat
me
they
do
treat
decently
retorted
marcia
oh
miss
kingsbury
treated
you
very
well
that
night
she
could
imagine
your
being
jealous
of
her
politeness
to
marcia
temper
fired
at
his
treacherous
recurrence
to
a
grievance
which
he
had
once
so
sacredly
and
sweetly
ignored
if
you
wish
to
take
up
bygones
why
do
you
go
back
to
hannah
morrison
at
once
she
treated
you
even
better
than
miss
i
should
have
been
very
willing
to
do
that
said
bartley
but
i
thought
it
might
remind
you
of
a
disagreeable
little
episode
in
your
own
life
when
you
flung
me
away
and
had
to
go
down
on
your
knees
to
pick
me
up
these
thrusts
which
they
dealt
each
other
in
their
quarrels
however
blind
and
misdirected
always
reached
their
hearts
it
was
the
wicked
will
that
hurt
rather
than
the
words
marcia
rose
bleeding
inwardly
and
her
husband
felt
the
remorse
of
a
man
who
gets
the
best
of
it
in
such
an
encounter
oh
i
sorry
i
said
that
marcia
i
did
mean
it
indeed
i
she
disdained
to
heed
him
as
she
swept
out
of
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
and
his
anger
flamed
out
again
i
give
you
fair
warning
he
called
after
her
not
to
try
that
trick
of
locking
the
door
or
i
will
smash
it
her
answer
was
to
turn
the
key
in
the
door
with
a
click
which
he
could
not
fail
to
hear
the
peace
in
which
they
had
been
living
of
late
was
very
comfortable
to
bartley
he
liked
it
he
hated
to
have
it
broken
he
was
willing
to
do
what
he
could
to
restore
it
at
once
if
he
had
no
better
motive
than
this
he
still
had
this
motive
and
he
choked
down
his
wrath
and
followed
marcia
softly
upstairs
he
intended
to
reason
with
her
and
he
began
i
say
marsh
as
he
turned
the
but
you
can
not
reason
through
a
keyhole
and
before
he
knew
he
found
himself
saying
will
you
open
this
in
a
tone
whose
quiet
was
deadly
she
did
not
answer
he
heard
her
stop
in
her
movements
about
the
room
and
wait
as
if
she
expected
him
to
ask
again
he
hesitated
a
moment
whether
to
keep
his
threat
of
breaking
the
door
in
but
he
turned
away
and
went
down
stairs
and
so
into
the
street
once
outside
he
experienced
the
sense
of
release
that
comes
to
a
man
from
the
violation
of
his
better
impulses
but
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
he
walked
rapidly
away
but
marcia
eyes
and
voice
seemed
to
follow
him
and
plead
with
him
for
his
forbearance
but
he
answered
his
conscience
as
if
it
had
been
some
such
presence
that
he
had
forborne
too
much
already
and
that
now
he
should
not
humble
himself
that
he
was
right
and
should
stand
upon
his
right
there
was
not
much
comfort
in
it
and
he
had
to
brace
himself
again
and
again
with
vindictive
resolution
xxiv
bartley
walked
about
the
streets
for
a
long
time
without
purpose
or
direction
brooding
fiercely
on
his
wrongs
and
reminding
himself
how
marcia
had
determined
to
have
him
and
had
indeed
flung
herself
upon
his
mercy
with
all
sorts
of
good
promises
and
had
then
at
once
taken
the
and
goaded
and
tormented
him
ever
since
all
the
kindness
of
their
common
life
counted
for
nothing
in
this
furious
reverie
or
rather
it
was
never
once
thought
of
he
cursed
himself
for
a
fool
that
he
had
ever
asked
her
to
marry
him
and
for
doubly
a
fool
that
he
had
married
her
when
she
had
as
good
as
asked
him
he
was
glad
now
that
he
had
taunted
her
with
that
he
only
regretted
that
he
had
told
her
he
was
sorry
he
was
presently
aware
of
being
so
tired
that
he
could
scarcely
pull
one
leg
after
another
and
yet
he
felt
hopelessly
wide
awake
it
was
in
simple
despair
of
anything
else
to
do
that
he
climbed
the
stairs
to
ricker
lofty
perch
in
the
office
ricker
turned
about
as
he
entered
and
stared
up
at
him
from
beneath
the
green
pasteboard
visor
with
which
he
was
shielding
his
eyes
from
the
gas
his
hair
which
was
of
the
harshness
and
color
of
hay
was
stiffly
poked
up
and
strewn
about
on
his
skull
as
if
it
were
some
foreign
product
hello
he
said
going
to
issue
a
morning
edition
of
the
events
what
makes
you
think
so
oh
i
supposed
you
gents
went
to
bed
with
the
hens
what
has
kept
you
up
esteemed
contemporary
he
went
on
working
over
some
despatches
which
lay
upon
his
table
do
you
want
to
come
out
and
have
some
oysters
asked
bartley
why
this
princely
hospitality
i
come
with
you
in
half
a
minute
ricker
said
going
to
the
slide
that
carried
up
the
copy
to
the
and
thrusting
his
manuscript
into
the
box
where
are
you
going
he
asked
when
they
found
themselves
out
in
the
soft
starlit
autumnal
air
and
bartley
answered
with
the
name
of
an
obscure
but
of
singular
excellence
yes
that
the
best
place
ricker
commented
what
i
always
wonder
at
in
you
is
the
rapidity
with
which
you
ve
taken
on
the
city
you
were
quite
in
the
green
wood
when
you
came
here
and
now
you
know
your
boston
like
a
little
man
i
suppose
it
your
newspaper
work
that
familiarized
you
with
the
place
well
how
do
you
like
your
friend
witherby
as
far
as
gone
oh
we
shall
get
along
i
guess
said
bartley
he
still
keeps
me
in
the
background
and
plays
at
being
editor
but
he
pays
me
pretty
not
too
well
i
i
should
like
to
see
him
try
i
should
said
ricker
he
expect
certain
things
of
you
if
he
did
you
have
to
look
out
for
you
mean
that
he
a
scamp
no
there
is
a
better
conscience
than
witherby
carries
in
the
whole
city
he
perfectly
honest
he
not
only
believes
that
he
has
a
right
to
run
the
events
in
his
way
but
he
sincerely
believes
that
he
is
right
in
doing
it
there
where
he
has
the
advantage
of
you
if
you
doubt
him
i
do
suppose
he
ever
did
a
wrong
thing
in
his
life
he
persuade
himself
that
the
thing
was
right
before
he
did
that
a
common
phenomenon
is
it
sneered
bartley
nobody
you
right
partly
but
some
of
us
sinners
have
our
misgivings
and
witherby
never
has
you
know
he
offered
me
your
place
no
i
did
said
bartley
astonished
and
not
pleased
i
thought
he
might
have
told
you
he
made
me
inducements
but
i
was
afraid
of
him
witherby
is
the
incarnate
i
talked
you
into
him
for
some
place
or
other
but
he
did
seem
to
wake
up
to
the
value
of
my
advice
at
once
then
i
could
tell
what
he
was
going
to
offer
thank
you
for
letting
me
in
for
a
thing
you
were
afraid
of
i
did
believe
he
would
get
you
under
his
thumb
as
he
would
me
got
more
than
i
have
i
have
to
keep
out
of
temptation
you
have
noticed
that
i
never
drink
and
i
would
rather
not
look
upon
witherby
when
he
is
red
and
giveth
his
color
in
the
cup
i
sorry
if
i
let
you
in
for
anything
that
you
regret
but
witherby
sincerity
makes
him
dangerous
i
own
i
think
he
has
some
very
good
ideas
about
newspapers
said
bartley
rather
sulkily
oh
very
assented
ricker
some
of
the
very
best
going
he
believes
that
the
press
is
a
great
moral
engine
and
that
it
ought
to
be
run
in
the
interest
of
the
and
i
suppose
you
believe
that
it
ought
to
be
run
in
the
interest
of
the
public
exactly
after
the
public
has
well
i
do
and
i
never
did
a
newspaper
is
a
private
it
private
property
but
it
is
a
private
enterprise
and
in
its
very
nature
it
ca
be
you
know
i
never
talk
and
stuff
it
amuses
me
to
hear
the
young
fellows
at
it
though
i
think
they
might
be
doing
something
worse
than
magnifying
their
office
they
might
be
decrying
it
but
i
got
a
few
ideas
and
principles
of
my
own
in
my
back
pantaloons
haul
them
out
said
bartley
i
do
know
that
they
very
well
formulated
returned
ricker
and
i
do
contend
that
they
very
new
but
i
consider
a
newspaper
a
public
enterprise
with
certain
distinct
duties
to
the
public
it
sacredly
bound
not
to
do
anything
to
deprave
or
debauch
its
readers
and
it
sacredly
bound
not
to
mislead
or
betray
them
not
merely
as
to
questions
of
morals
and
politics
but
as
to
questions
of
what
we
may
lump
as
has
friend
witherby
developed
his
great
ideas
of
advertisers
rights
to
you
bartley
did
not
answer
and
ricker
went
on
well
then
you
can
understand
my
position
when
i
say
it
exactly
the
you
ought
to
be
on
a
religious
newspaper
ricker
said
bartley
with
a
scornful
laugh
thank
you
a
secular
paper
is
bad
enough
for
well
i
do
pretend
that
i
make
the
events
just
what
i
want
said
bartley
at
present
the
most
i
can
do
is
to
indulge
in
a
few
cheap
dreams
of
what
i
should
do
if
i
had
a
paper
of
my
what
are
your
dreams
haul
out
as
you
i
should
make
it
pay
to
begin
with
and
i
should
make
it
pay
by
making
it
such
a
thorough
newspaper
that
every
class
of
people
have
it
i
should
cater
to
the
lowest
class
first
and
as
long
as
i
was
poor
i
would
have
the
fullest
and
best
reports
of
every
local
accident
and
crime
that
would
take
all
the
rabble
then
as
i
could
afford
it
i
rise
a
little
and
give
reports
of
local
political
affairs
that
would
fetch
the
next
largest
class
the
ward
politicians
of
all
parties
i
lay
for
the
local
religious
world
after
that
religion
comes
right
after
politics
in
the
popular
mind
and
it
interests
the
women
like
murder
i
give
the
minutest
religious
intelligence
and
not
only
that
but
the
religious
gossip
and
the
religious
scandal
then
i
go
in
for
fashion
and
society
that
comes
next
i
have
the
most
reliable
and
financial
reports
that
money
could
buy
when
i
got
my
local
ground
perfectly
covered
i
begin
to
ramify
every
fellow
that
could
spell
in
any
part
of
the
country
should
understand
that
if
he
sent
me
an
account
of
a
suicide
or
an
elopement
or
a
murder
or
an
accident
he
should
be
well
paid
for
it
and
i
rise
on
the
same
scale
through
all
the
departments
i
add
art
criticisms
dramatic
and
sporting
news
and
book
reviews
more
for
the
looks
of
the
thing
than
for
anything
else
they
any
of
appeal
to
a
large
class
i
get
my
paper
into
such
a
shape
that
people
of
every
kind
and
degree
would
have
to
say
no
matter
what
particular
objection
was
made
to
it
that
so
but
it
the
best
in
the
world
we
ca
get
along
without
it
and
then
said
ricker
you
begin
to
clean
up
little
by
little
let
up
on
your
murders
and
scandals
and
purge
and
live
cleanly
like
a
gentleman
the
trick
been
tried
they
had
arrived
at
the
and
were
sitting
at
their
table
waiting
for
the
oysters
to
be
brought
to
them
bartley
tilted
his
chair
back
i
do
know
about
the
cleaning
up
i
should
want
to
keep
all
my
audience
if
i
cleaned
up
the
dirty
fellows
would
go
off
to
some
one
else
and
the
fellows
that
pretended
to
be
clean
would
be
why
do
you
get
witherby
to
put
your
ideas
in
force
asked
ricker
dryly
bartley
dropped
his
chair
to
all
fours
and
said
with
a
smile
he
belongs
to
ah
he
has
his
limitations
what
a
pity
he
has
the
money
to
establish
this
great
moral
engine
of
yours
and
you
have
it
a
loss
to
one
thing
i
know
said
bartley
with
a
certain
effect
of
virtue
nobody
should
buy
or
sell
me
and
the
advertising
element
should
spread
beyond
the
advertising
is
that
rather
high
ground
inquired
ricker
bartley
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
answer
i
do
believe
that
a
newspaper
is
obliged
to
be
superior
in
tone
to
the
community
he
said
i
quite
agree
with
and
if
the
community
is
full
of
vice
and
crime
the
newspaper
ca
do
better
than
reflect
its
ah
there
i
should
distinguish
esteemed
contemporary
there
are
several
tones
in
every
community
and
it
will
keep
any
newspaper
scratching
to
rise
above
the
highest
but
if
it
keeps
out
of
the
mud
at
all
it
ca
help
rising
above
the
lowest
and
no
community
is
full
of
vice
and
crime
any
more
than
it
is
full
of
virtue
and
good
works
why
not
let
your
model
newspaper
mirror
these
they
not
no
that
you
must
give
the
people
what
they
are
you
sure
of
that
yes
i
well
it
a
beautiful
dream
said
ricker
nourished
on
a
youth
sublime
why
do
not
these
lofty
imaginings
visit
us
later
in
life
you
make
me
quite
ashamed
of
my
own
ideal
newspaper
before
you
began
to
talk
i
had
been
fancying
that
the
vice
of
our
journalism
was
its
intense
localism
i
have
doubted
a
good
while
whether
a
drunken
irishman
who
breaks
his
wife
head
or
a
child
who
falls
into
a
tub
of
hot
water
has
really
established
a
claim
on
the
public
interest
why
should
i
be
told
by
telegraph
how
three
negroes
died
on
the
gallows
in
north
carolina
why
should
an
accurate
correspondent
inform
me
of
the
elopement
of
a
married
man
with
his
in
east
machias
why
should
i
sup
on
all
the
horrors
of
a
railroad
accident
and
have
the
bleeding
fragments
hashed
up
for
me
at
breakfast
why
should
my
newspaper
give
a
succession
of
shocks
to
my
nervous
system
as
i
pass
from
column
to
column
and
poultice
me
between
shocks
with
the
nastiness
of
a
distant
or
local
scandal
you
reply
because
i
like
spice
but
i
do
i
am
sick
of
spice
and
i
believe
that
most
of
our
readers
cater
to
them
with
then
said
bartley
ricker
laughed
with
him
and
they
fell
to
upon
their
oysters
when
they
parted
bartley
still
found
himself
wakeful
he
knew
that
he
should
not
sleep
if
he
went
home
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
could
not
walk
about
all
night
he
turned
into
a
basement
and
asked
for
something
in
the
way
of
a
nightcap
the
said
there
was
nothing
like
a
to
make
you
sleep
and
a
small
man
with
his
hat
on
who
had
been
talking
with
the
and
coming
up
to
the
counter
occasionally
to
eat
a
bit
of
cracker
or
a
bit
of
cheese
out
of
the
two
bowls
full
of
such
fragments
that
stood
at
the
end
of
the
counter
said
that
this
was
so
it
was
very
cheerful
in
the
with
the
light
glittering
on
the
rows
of
decanters
behind
the
a
large
stout
clean
pale
man
in
his
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
and
bartley
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
there
till
he
was
drowsy
and
to
drink
as
many
as
were
necessary
to
the
result
he
had
his
drink
put
on
a
little
table
and
sat
down
to
it
easily
stirring
it
to
cool
it
a
little
and
feeling
its
flattery
in
his
brain
from
the
first
sip
the
man
who
was
munching
cheese
and
crackers
wore
a
hat
rather
large
for
him
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
he
now
said
that
he
did
not
care
if
he
took
a
and
the
promptly
set
it
before
him
on
the
counter
and
saluted
with
good
evening
colonel
a
large
man
who
came
in
carrying
a
small
dog
in
his
arms
bartley
recognized
him
as
the
manager
of
a
variety
combination
playing
at
one
of
the
theatres
and
the
manager
recognized
the
little
man
with
the
as
tommy
he
did
not
return
the
salutation
but
he
asked
as
he
sat
down
at
a
table
what
do
i
want
for
supper
charley
the
said
oracularly
as
he
leaned
forward
to
wipe
his
counter
with
a
napkin
fricassee
fricassee
devil
returned
the
manager
get
me
a
welsh
the
unperturbed
by
this
rejection
called
into
the
tube
behind
him
one
welsh
i
want
some
cold
chicken
for
my
dog
said
the
manager
one
cold
chicken
repeated
the
in
his
tube
white
meat
said
the
manager
white
meat
repeated
the
i
went
into
the
parker
house
one
night
about
midnight
and
i
saw
four
doctors
there
eating
lobster
salad
and
devilled
crab
and
washing
it
down
with
champagne
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
doctors
need
talk
to
me
any
more
about
what
was
wholesome
i
was
going
in
for
what
was
and
there
aint
anything
better
for
supper
than
welsh
rabbit
in
as
the
manager
addressed
this
philosophy
to
the
company
at
large
no
one
commented
upon
it
which
seemed
quite
the
same
to
the
manager
who
hitched
one
elbow
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
caressed
with
the
other
hand
the
dog
lying
in
his
lap
the
little
man
in
the
large
hat
continued
to
walk
up
and
down
leaving
his
on
the
counter
and
drinking
it
between
his
visits
to
the
cracker
and
cheese
what
that
new
piece
of
yours
colonel
he
asked
after
a
while
i
aint
seen
it
legs
principally
sighed
the
manager
that
what
the
public
wants
i
give
the
public
what
it
wants
i
do
pretend
to
be
any
better
than
the
public
nor
any
worse
he
added
stroking
his
dog
these
ideas
struck
bartley
in
their
accordance
with
his
own
ideas
of
journalism
as
he
had
propounded
them
to
ricker
he
had
drunk
half
of
his
that
what
i
say
assented
the
little
man
all
that
a
theatre
has
got
to
do
is
to
keep
even
with
the
that
so
tommy
said
the
manager
of
a
school
of
morals
with
wisdom
that
impressed
more
and
more
the
manager
of
a
great
moral
engine
the
same
principle
runs
through
everything
observed
bartley
speaking
for
the
first
time
the
drink
had
stiffened
his
tongue
somewhat
but
it
did
not
incommode
his
utterance
it
rather
gave
dignity
to
it
and
his
head
was
singularly
clear
he
lifted
his
empty
glass
from
the
table
and
catching
the
eye
said
do
it
the
man
brought
it
back
full
it
runs
through
the
churches
as
well
as
the
theatres
as
long
as
the
public
wanted
the
ministers
gave
them
but
you
could
get
not
the
pure
brimstone
article
out
of
a
popular
preacher
now
for
love
or
the
little
man
said
i
guess
you
got
about
the
size
of
it
there
and
the
manager
laughed
it
just
so
with
the
newspapers
too
said
bartley
some
newspapers
used
to
stand
out
against
publishing
murders
and
personal
gossip
and
divorce
trials
there
ai
a
newspaper
that
pretends
to
keep
anyways
up
with
the
times
now
that
do
do
it
the
public
want
spice
and
they
will
have
it
well
sir
said
the
manager
that
my
way
of
looking
at
it
i
say
if
the
public
do
want
shakespeare
give
burlesque
till
they
sick
of
it
i
believe
in
what
grant
said
quickest
way
to
get
rid
of
a
bad
law
is
to
enforce
it
that
so
said
the
little
man
every
he
added
to
the
that
he
guessed
he
would
have
some
brandy
and
soda
and
bartley
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
his
second
tumbler
he
ordered
it
replenished
the
little
man
seemed
to
be
getting
further
away
he
said
from
the
distance
to
which
he
had
withdrawn
you
want
to
go
to
bed
with
three
nightcaps
on
like
an
bartley
felt
like
resenting
the
freedom
but
he
was
anxious
to
pour
his
ideas
of
journalism
into
the
manager
sympathetic
ear
and
he
began
to
talk
with
an
impression
that
it
behooved
him
to
talk
fast
his
brain
was
still
very
clear
but
his
tongue
was
getting
stiffer
the
manager
now
had
his
welsh
rabbit
before
him
but
bartley
could
not
make
out
how
it
had
got
there
nor
when
he
was
talking
fast
and
he
knew
by
the
way
everybody
was
listening
that
he
was
talking
well
sometimes
he
left
his
table
glass
in
hand
and
went
and
laid
down
the
law
to
the
manager
who
smilingly
assented
to
all
he
said
once
he
heard
a
low
growling
at
his
feet
and
looking
down
he
saw
the
dog
with
his
plate
of
cold
chicken
that
had
also
been
conjured
into
the
room
somehow
look
out
said
the
manager
he
nip
you
in
the
curse
the
dog
he
seems
to
be
on
all
sides
of
you
said
bartley
i
stand
better
sit
down
then
suggested
the
manager
good
idea
said
the
little
man
who
was
still
walking
up
and
down
it
appeared
as
if
he
had
not
spoken
for
several
hours
his
hat
was
further
over
his
eyes
bartley
had
thought
he
was
gone
what
business
is
it
of
yours
he
demanded
fiercely
moving
towards
the
little
man
come
none
of
that
said
the
steadily
bartley
looked
at
him
in
amazement
where
your
hat
he
asked
the
others
laughed
the
smiled
are
you
a
married
man
never
mind
said
the
severely
bartley
turned
to
the
little
man
you
married
not
replied
the
other
he
was
now
topping
off
with
a
bartley
referred
himself
to
the
manager
you
si
said
the
manager
who
did
his
own
adapting
from
the
french
well
you
scholar
and
you
gentleman
said
bartley
the
indefinite
articles
would
drop
out
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
keep
them
in
i
want
ask
you
what
you
do
to
ask
you
what
would
you
do
he
repeated
with
painful
exactness
but
he
failed
to
make
the
rest
of
the
sentence
perfect
and
he
pronounced
it
all
in
a
word
i
take
a
walk
said
the
manager
i
the
door
in
said
the
little
man
bartley
turned
and
gazed
at
him
as
if
the
little
man
were
a
much
more
estimable
person
than
he
had
supposed
he
passed
his
arm
through
the
little
man
which
the
other
had
just
crooked
to
lift
his
whiskey
to
his
mouth
look
here
said
bartley
tha
jus
what
told
her
i
want
you
to
go
home

i
want
t
introduce
you
to
my
all

answered
the
little
man
do

if
i
he
dropped
his
tumbler
to
the
floor
hang
it
up
charley
glass
and
all

it
to

yourself
every
time
they
got
themselves
out
of
the
door
and
the
manager
said
to
the
who
came
round
to
gather
up
the
fragments
of
the
broken
tumbler
think
his
wife
will
be
glad
to
see
charley
oh
they
be
taken
care
of
before
they
reach
his
xxv
when
they
were
once
out
under
the
stars
bartley
who
still
felt
his
brain
clear
said
that
he
would
not
take
his
friend
home
at
once
but
would
show
him
where
he
visited
when
he
first
came
to
boston
the
other
agreed
to
the
indulgence
of
this
sentiment
and
they
set
out
to
find
rumford

come
to
it
i
can
ever
find
they
walked
up
and
down
the
street
looking
while
bartley
poured
his
sorrows
into
the
ear
of
his
friend
who
grew
less
and
less
responsive
and
at
last
ceased
from
his
side
altogether
bartley
then
dimly
perceived
that
he
was
himself
sitting
on
a
and
that
his
head
was
hanging
far
down
between
his
knees
as
if
he
had
been
sleeping
in
that
posture
locked
out
locked
out
of
my
own
door
and
by
my
own
wife
he
shed
tears
and
fell
asleep
again
from
time
to
time
he
woke
and
bewailed
himself
to
ricker
as
a
poor
boy
who
had
fought
his
own
way
he
owned
that
he
had
made
mistakes
as
who
had
not
again
he
was
trying
to
convince
squire
gaylord
that
they
ought
to
issue
a
daily
edition
of
the
equity
free
press
and
at
the
same
time
persuading
halleck
to
buy
the
events
for
him
and
let
him
put
it
on
a
paying
basis
he
shivered
sighed
hiccupped
and
was
dozing
off
again
when
henry
bird
knocked
him
down
and
he
fell
with
a
cry
which
at
last
brought
to
the
door
the
uneasy
sleeper
who
had
been
listening
to
him
within
and
trying
to
realize
his
presence
catching
his
voice
in
waking
intervals
doubting
it
drowsing
when
it
ceased
and
then
catching
it
and
losing
it
again
hello
here
what
do
you
want
hubbard
is
it
you
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
here
halleck
said
bartley
who
was
unsteadily
straightening
himself
upon
his
feet
glad
to
find
you
at
home
been
looking
for
your
house
all
night
want
to
introduce
you
to
friend
of
mine
halleck
curse
me
if
i
know
your
name
hold
on
a
minute
said
halleck
he
ran
into
the
house
for
his
hat
and
coat
and
came
out
again
closing
the
door
softly
after
him
he
found
bartley
in
the
grip
of
a
policeman
whom
he
was
asking
his
name
that
he
might
introduce
him
to
his
friend
halleck
do
you
know
this
man
halleck
asked
the
policeman
yes
yes
i
know
him
said
ben
in
a
low
voice
let
get
him
away
quietly
please
he
all
right
it
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
so
will
you
help
me
with
him
up
to
johnson
stable
i
get
a
carriage
there
and
take
him
they
had
begun
walking
bartley
along
between
them
he
dozed
and
paid
no
attention
to
their
talk
the
policeman
laughed
i
was
just
going
to
run
him
in
when
you
came
out
you
did
come
a
minute
too
they
got
bartley
to
the
stable
and
he
slept
heavily
in
one
of
the
chairs
in
the
office
while
the
ostlers
were
putting
the
horses
to
the
carriage
the
policeman
remained
at
the
looking
in
at
bartley
and
philosophizing
the
situation
to
halleck
your
speakin
about
its
bein
the
first
time
you
ever
saw
him
so
made
me
think
i
rather
help
take
home
a
regular
habitual
drunk
to
his
family
any
day
than
a
case
like
this
they
always
seem
to
take
it
so
much
harder
the
first
time
boards
with
his
mother
i
presume
he
married
said
halleck
sadly
he
has
a
house
of
his
well
said
the
policeman
bartley
slept
all
the
way
to
clover
street
and
when
the
carriage
stopped
at
his
door
they
had
difficulty
in
waking
him
sufficiently
to
get
him
out
do
come
in
please
said
halleck
to
the
policeman
when
this
was
done
the
man
will
carry
you
back
to
your
beat
thank
you
ever
so
much
all
right
halleck
do
mention
it
said
the
policeman
and
leaned
back
in
the
hack
with
an
air
of
luxury
as
it
rumbled
softly
away
halleck
remained
on
the
pavement
with
bartley
falling
limply
against
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
dawn
what
you
want
what
you
doing
with
me
he
demanded
with
sullen
stupidity
i
got
you
home
hubbard
here
we
are
at
your
he
pulled
him
across
the
pavement
to
the
threshold
and
put
his
hand
on
the
bell
but
the
door
was
thrown
open
before
he
could
ring
and
marcia
stood
there
with
her
face
white
and
her
eyes
red
with
watching
and
crying
oh
bartley
oh
bartley
she
sobbed
oh
halleck
what
is
it
is
he
hurt
i
did
it
yes
i
did
it
it
my
fault
oh
will
he
die
is
he
sick
he
is
very
well
he
better
go
to
bed
said
halleck
yes
yes
i
will
help
you
upstairs
with
do
need
any
help
said
bartley
sulkily
go
upstairs
he
actually
did
so
with
the
help
of
the
marcia
running
before
to
open
the
door
and
smooth
the
pillows
which
her
head
had
not
touched
and
halleck
following
him
to
catch
him
if
he
should
fall
she
unlaced
his
shoes
and
got
them
off
while
halleck
removed
his
coat
oh
bartley
where
do
you
feel
badly
dear
oh
i
what
shall
i
do
she
moaned
as
he
tumbled
himself
on
the
bed
and
lapsed
into
a
drunken
stupor
better
better
come
out
hubbard
said
halleck
better
let
him
alone
now
you
only
make
him
worse
talking
to
quelled
by
the
mystery
of
his
manner
she
followed
him
out
and
down
the
stairs
oh
tell
me
what
it
is
she
implored
in
a
low
voice
or
i
shall
go
wild
but
tell
me
and
i
can
bear
it
i
can
bear
anything
if
i
know
what
it
is
she
came
close
to
him
in
her
entreaty
and
fixed
her
eyes
beseechingly
on
his
while
she
caught
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
is
he
is
he
insane
he
is
quite
in
his
right
mind
hubbard
halleck
began
softly
releasing
himself
and
retreating
a
little
from
her
but
she
pursued
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
oh
then
go
for
the
doctor
go
instantly
do
lose
a
minute
i
shall
not
be
afraid
to
stay
alone
or
if
you
think
i
better
not
i
will
go
for
the
doctor
no
no
said
halleck
smiling
sadly
the
case
certainly
had
its
ludicrous
side
he
does
need
a
doctor
you
must
think
of
calling
a
doctor
indeed
you
must
he
come
out
all
right
of
himself
if
you
sent
for
a
doctor
it
would
make
him
very
she
burst
into
tears
well
i
will
do
what
you
say
she
cried
it
would
never
have
happened
if
it
had
been
for
me
i
want
to
tell
you
what
i
did
she
went
on
wildly
i
want
to
tell
please
do
tell
me
anything
hubbard
it
will
all
come
right
and
very
soon
it
is
anything
to
be
alarmed
about
he
be
well
in
a
few
hours
i
ah
good
he
had
found
his
cane
and
he
made
a
limp
toward
the
door
but
she
swiftly
interposed
herself
why
she
panted
in
mixed
reproach
and
terror
you
not
going
away
you
not
going
to
leave
me
before
bartley
is
well
he
may
get
worse
he
may
die
you
must
go
halleck
yes
i
must
i
ca
stay
i
ought
to
stay
it
wo
do
he
get
worse
he
wo
the
perspiration
broke
out
on
halleck
face
which
he
lifted
to
hers
with
a
distress
as
great
as
her
own
she
only
answered
i
ca
let
you
go
it
would
kill
me
i
wonder
at
your
wanting
to
there
was
something
ghastly
comical
in
it
all
and
halleck
stood
in
fear
of
its
absurdity
hardly
less
than
of
its
tragedy
he
rapidly
revolved
in
his
mind
the
possibilities
of
the
case
he
thought
at
first
that
it
might
be
well
to
call
a
doctor
and
having
explained
the
situation
to
him
pay
him
to
remain
in
charge
but
he
reflected
that
it
would
be
insulting
to
ask
a
doctor
to
see
a
man
in
hubbard
condition
he
took
out
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
six
and
he
said
desperately
you
can
send
for
me
if
you
get
anxious
i
ca
let
you
go
i
must
really
get
my
breakfast
the
girl
will
get
something
for
you
here
oh
go
away
her
lip
began
to
quiver
again
and
her
bosom
to
rise
he
could
not
bear
it
mrs
hubbard
will
you
believe
what
i
say
yes
she
faltered
reluctantly
well
i
tell
you
that
hubbard
is
in
no
sort
of
danger
and
i
know
that
it
would
be
extremely
offensive
to
him
if
i
then
you
must
go
she
answered
promptly
and
opened
the
door
which
she
had
closed
for
fear
he
might
escape
i
will
send
for
a
no
send
for
a
doctor
do
send
for
anybody
do
speak
of
the
matter
to
any
one
it
would
be
very
mortifying
to
him
it
merely
a
a
kind
of
seizure
that
a
great
many
people
men
are
subject
to
but
he
would
like
to
have
it
he
saw
that
his
words
were
making
an
impression
upon
her
perhaps
her
innocence
was
beginning
to
divine
the
truth
will
you
do
what
i
say
yes
she
murmured
her
head
began
to
droop
and
her
face
to
turn
away
in
a
dawning
shame
too
cruel
for
him
to
see
i
i
will
come
back
as
soon
as
i
get
my
breakfast
to
make
sure
that
everything
is
she
let
him
find
his
own
way
out
and
halleck
issued
upon
the
street
as
miserable
as
if
the
disgrace
were
his
own
it
was
easy
enough
for
him
to
get
back
into
his
own
room
without
alarming
the
family
he
ate
his
breakfast
absently
and
then
went
out
while
the
others
were
still
at
table
i
do
think
ben
seems
very
well
said
his
mother
anxiously
and
she
looked
to
her
husband
for
the
denial
he
always
gave
oh
i
guess
he
all
right
what
the
matter
with
him
it
nothing
but
his
ridiculous
romantic
way
of
taking
the
world
to
heart
olive
interposed
you
may
be
sure
he
troubled
about
something
that
does
concern
him
in
the
least
it
what
comes
of
the
conscientiousness
of
his
parents
if
ben
does
turn
out
a
philanthropist
of
the
deepest
dye
yet
you
have
me
to
thank
for
it
i
see
more
and
more
every
day
that
i
was
providentially
born
wicked
so
as
to
keep
this
besottedly
righteous
family
head
above
she
feigned
an
angry
impatience
with
the
condition
of
things
but
when
her
father
went
out
she
joined
her
mother
in
earnest
conjectures
as
to
what
ben
had
on
his
mind
halleck
wandered
about
till
nearly
ten
and
then
he
went
to
the
little
house
on
clover
street
the
answered
his
ring
and
when
he
asked
for
hubbard
she
said
that
hubbard
wished
to
see
him
and
please
would
he
step
upstairs
he
found
bartley
seated
at
the
window
with
a
wet
towel
round
his
head
and
his
face
pale
with
headache
well
old
man
he
said
with
an
assumption
of
comradery
that
was
nauseous
to
halleck
you
done
the
handsome
thing
by
me
i
know
all
about
it
i
knew
something
about
it
all
the
he
held
out
his
hand
without
rising
and
halleck
forced
himself
to
touch
it
i
appreciate
your
delicacy
in
not
telling
my
wife
of
course
you
tell
he
said
with
depraved
enjoyment
of
what
he
conceived
of
halleck
embarrassment
but
i
guess
she
must
have
smelt
a
rat
as
the
fellow
says
he
added
seeing
the
disgust
that
halleck
could
not
keep
out
of
his
face
i
shall
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
as
soon
as
she
can
bear
it
she
pretty
lying
down
now
he
explained
you
see
i
went
out
to
get
something
to
make
me
sleep
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
had
got
too
much
good
thing
i
turned
up
on
your
doorstep
might
have
been
waltzing
into
the
police
court
about
now
how
did
you
happen
to
hear
me
halleck
briefly
explained
with
an
air
of
abhorrence
for
the
facts
yes
i
remember
most
of
it
said
bartley
well
i
want
to
thank
you
halleck
you
saved
me
from
disgrace
from
ruin
for
all
i
know
whew
how
my
head
aches
he
said
making
an
appeal
to
halleck
pity
with
closed
eyes
halleck
he
murmured
feebly
i
wish
you
would
do
me
a
yes
what
is
it
asked
halleck
dryly
go
round
to
the
events
office
and
tell
old
witherby
that
i
be
able
to
put
in
an
appearance
i
not
up
to
writing
a
note
even
and
he
feel
flattered
at
your
coming
personally
it
would
make
it
all
right
for
of
course
i
will
go
said
halleck
thanks
returned
bartley
plaintively
with
his
eyes
closed
xxvi
bartley
would
willingly
have
passed
this
affair
over
with
marcia
like
some
of
their
quarrels
and
allowed
a
reconciliation
to
effect
itself
through
mere
lapse
of
time
and
daily
custom
but
there
were
difficulties
in
the
way
to
such
an
end
his
shameful
escapade
had
given
the
quarrel
a
character
of
its
own
which
could
not
be
ignored
he
must
keep
his
word
about
making
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
marcia
whether
he
liked
or
not
but
she
facilitated
his
confession
by
the
meek
and
dependent
fashion
in
which
she
hovered
about
anxious
to
do
something
or
anything
for
him
if
as
he
suggested
to
halleck
she
had
divined
the
truth
she
evidently
did
not
hold
him
wholly
to
blame
for
what
had
happened
and
he
was
not
without
a
sense
of
having
given
her
a
useful
and
necessary
lesson
he
was
inclined
to
a
severity
to
which
his
rasped
and
shaken
nerves
contributed
when
he
spoke
to
her
that
night
as
they
sat
together
after
tea
she
had
some
sewing
in
her
lap
little
mysteries
of
soft
muslin
for
the
baby
which
she
was
edging
with
lace
and
her
head
drooped
over
her
work
as
if
she
could
not
confront
him
with
her
swollen
eyes
look
here
marcia
he
said
do
you
know
what
was
the
matter
with
me
this
morning
she
did
not
answer
in
words
her
hands
quivered
a
moment
then
she
caught
up
the
things
out
of
her
lap
and
sobbed
into
them
the
sight
unmanned
bartley
he
hated
to
see
any
one
cry
even
his
wife
to
whose
tears
he
was
accustomed
he
dropped
down
beside
her
on
the
sofa
and
pulled
her
head
over
on
his
shoulder
it
was
my
fault
it
was
my
fault
bartley
she
sobbed
oh
how
can
i
ever
get
over
it
well
do
cry
do
cry
it
was
altogether
your
fault
returned
bartley
we
were
both
to
no
i
began
it
if
i
had
broken
my
promise
about
speaking
of
hannah
morrison
it
never
would
have
this
was
so
true
that
bartley
could
not
gainsay
it
but
i
could
seem
to
help
it
and
you
were
you
were
so
quick
with
me
you
did
give
me
time
to
think
you
but
i
was
the
one
to
blame
i
was
to
blame
oh
well
never
mind
about
it
do
take
on
so
coaxed
bartley
all
over
now
and
it
ca
be
helped
and
i
can
promise
you
he
added
that
it
shall
never
happen
again
no
matter
what
you
do
and
in
making
this
promise
he
felt
the
glow
of
virtuous
performance
i
think
we
both
had
a
lesson
i
suppose
he
continued
sadly
as
one
might
from
impersonal
reflection
upon
the
temptations
and
depravity
of
large
cities
that
enough
i
dare
say
it
is
the
first
time
ben
halleck
has
taken
a
fellow
home
in
a
bartley
got
so
much
comfort
from
the
conjecture
he
had
thrown
out
for
marcia
advantage
that
he
felt
a
sort
of
in
the
fact
with
which
he
followed
it
up
and
there
this
consolation
about
it
if
there
is
any
other
that
it
would
have
happened
now
if
it
had
ever
happened
marcia
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
his
face
what
what
do
you
mean
bartley
i
mean
that
i
never
was
overcome
before
in
my
life
by
he
delicately
avoided
saying
whiskey
well
she
demanded
why
do
you
see
if
i
had
the
habit
of
drinking
i
should
have
been
affected
by
i
do
understand
she
said
anxiously
why
i
knew
i
should
be
able
to
sleep
i
was
so
mad
at
you
oh
and
i
dropped
into
the
hotel
for
a
nightcap
for
something
to
make
me
yes
yes
she
urged
eagerly
i
took
what
would
have
touched
a
man
that
was
in
the
habit
of
poor
bartley
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
had
got
too
much
i
was
drunk
wild
drunk
he
said
with
magnanimous
frankness
she
had
been
listening
intensely
exculpating
him
at
every
point
and
now
his
innocence
all
flashed
upon
her
i
see
i
see
she
cried
and
it
was
because
you
had
never
tasted
it
before
well
i
had
tasted
it
once
or
twice
interrupted
bartley
with
heroic
veracity
no
matter
it
was
because
you
had
never
more
than
hardly
tasted
it
that
a
very
little
overcame
you
in
an
instant
i
see
she
repeated
contemplating
him
in
her
ecstasy
as
the
one
habitually
sober
man
in
a
boston
full
of
inebriates
and
now
i
shall
never
regret
it
i
shall
never
care
for
it
i
never
shall
think
about
it
again
or
yes
i
shall
always
remember
it
because
it
shows
because
it
that
you
are
always
strictly
temperance
it
was
worth
happening
for
that
i
am
it
happened
she
rose
from
his
side
and
took
her
sewing
nearer
the
lamp
and
resumed
her
work
upon
it
with
shining
eyes
bartley
remained
in
his
place
on
the
sofa
feeling
and
perhaps
looking
rather
sheepish
he
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
and
the
confession
had
redounded
only
too
much
to
his
credit
to
do
him
justice
he
had
not
intended
to
bring
the
affair
to
quite
such
a
triumphant
conclusion
and
perhaps
something
better
than
his
sense
of
humor
was
also
touched
when
he
found
himself
not
only
exonerated
but
transformed
into
an
exemplar
of
abstinence
well
he
said
it
is
exactly
a
thing
to
be
glad
of
but
it
certainly
is
a
thing
to
worry
yourself
about
you
know
the
worst
of
it
and
you
know
the
best
of
it
it
never
happened
before
and
it
never
shall
happen
again
that
all
do
lament
over
it
do
accuse
yourself
just
let
it
go
and
we
both
see
what
we
can
do
after
this
in
the
way
of
behaving
he
rose
from
the
sofa
and
began
to
walk
about
the
room
does
your
head
still
ache
she
asked
fondly
i
i
could
do
something
for
it
oh
i
shall
sleep
it
off
returned
bartley
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
bartley
well
do
you
suppose
do
you
believe
that
halleck
that
he
was
ever
no
marcia
i
do
said
bartley
stopping
i
he
never
was
ben
halleck
is
slow
but
he
good
i
could
imagine
his
being
drunk
any
more
than
i
could
imagine
your
being
so
i
willingly
sacrifice
his
reputation
to
console
you
added
bartley
with
a
comical
sense
of
his
own
regret
that
halleck
was
not
for
the
occasion
an
habitual
drunkard
but
i
can
not
tell
a
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
and
broke
into
a
sudden
laugh
no
my
dear
the
only
person
i
think
of
just
now
as
having
suffered
similarly
with
myself
is
the
great
and
good
andrew
johnson
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
was
he
the
one
they
impeached
she
faltered
not
knowing
what
bartley
would
be
at
but
smiling
faintly
in
sympathy
with
his
mirth
he
was
the
one
they
impeached
he
was
the
one
who
was
overcome
by
wine
on
his
inauguration
day
because
he
had
never
been
overcome
before
it
a
parallel
case
bartley
got
a
great
deal
more
enjoyment
out
of
the
parallel
case
than
marcia
the
smile
faded
from
her
face
come
come
he
coaxed
be
satisfied
with
andrew
johnson
and
let
halleck
go
ah
marcia
he
added
seriously
ben
halleck
is
the
kind
of
man
you
ought
to
have
married
do
you
suppose
that
i
know
i
not
good
enough
for
you
i
pretty
good
by
fits
and
starts
but
he
would
have
been
good
right
straight
along
i
should
never
have
had
to
bring
home
in
a
hack
to
you
his
generous
admission
had
the
just
effect
hush
bartley
do
talk
so
you
know
that
you
better
for
me
than
the
best
man
in
the
world
dear
and
even
if
you
were
not
i
should
love
you
the
best
do
talk
please
that
way
of
any
one
else
or
it
will
make
me
hate
you
he
liked
that
and
after
all
he
was
not
without
an
obscure
pride
in
his
last
night
adventure
as
a
somewhat
hazardous
but
decided
assertion
of
manly
supremacy
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
repeated
but
for
once
in
a
way
it
was
not
wholly
to
be
regretted
especially
as
he
was
so
well
out
of
it
he
pulled
up
a
chair
in
front
of
her
and
began
to
joke
about
the
things
she
had
in
her
lap
and
the
shameful
and
sorrowful
day
ended
in
the
bliss
of
a
more
perfect
peace
between
them
than
they
had
known
since
the
troubles
of
their
married
life
began
i
tell
you
said
bartley
to
marcia
i
shall
stick
to
tivoli
after
this
it
was
several
weeks
later
that
halleck
limped
into
atherton
lodgings
and
dropped
into
one
of
his
friend
the
room
had
a
bachelor
comfort
of
aspect
and
the
shaded
lamp
on
the
table
shed
a
mellow
light
on
the
green
furniture
wrinkled
and
creased
and
worn
full
of
such
hospitable
hollows
as
that
which
welcomed
halleck
some
packages
of
law
papers
were
scattered
about
on
the
table
but
the
hour
of
the
night
had
come
when
a
lawyer
permits
himself
a
novel
atherton
looked
up
from
his
as
halleck
entered
and
stretched
out
a
hand
which
the
latter
took
on
his
way
to
the
across
the
table
how
do
you
do
said
atherton
after
allowing
him
to
sit
for
a
certain
time
in
the
silence
which
expressed
better
than
words
the
familiarity
that
existed
between
them
in
spite
of
the
lawyer
six
or
seven
years
of
seniority
halleck
leaned
forward
and
tapped
the
floor
with
his
stick
then
he
fell
back
again
and
laid
his
cane
across
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
drew
a
long
breath
atherton
he
said
if
you
had
found
a
blackguard
of
your
acquaintance
drunk
on
your
doorstep
early
one
morning
and
had
taken
him
home
to
his
wife
how
would
you
have
expected
her
to
treat
you
the
next
time
you
saw
her
the
lawyer
was
too
much
used
to
the
statement
direct
and
hypothetical
of
all
sorts
of
cases
to
be
startled
at
this
he
smiled
slightly
and
said
that
would
depend
a
good
deal
upon
the
oh
but
generalize
from
what
you
know
of
women
as
woman
what
should
you
expect
should
you
expect
her
to
make
you
pay
somehow
for
your
privity
to
her
disgrace
to
revenge
her
misery
upon
you
is
there
a
theory
that
women
forgive
injuries
but
never
ignominies
that
what
the
novelists
teach
and
we
bachelors
get
most
of
our
doctrine
about
women
from
he
closed
his
novel
on
the
and
laying
the
book
upon
the
table
clasped
his
hands
together
at
the
back
of
his
head
we
do
go
to
nature
for
our
impressions
but
neither
do
the
novelists
for
that
matter
now
and
then
however
in
the
way
of
business
i
get
a
glimpse
of
realities
that
make
me
doubt
my
prophets
who
had
this
experience
i
i
sorry
for
that
said
atherton
yes
returned
halleck
with
whimsical
melancholy
i
not
particularly
adapted
for
it
but
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
a
very
pleasant
experience
for
he
paused
drearily
and
atherton
said
and
how
did
she
actually
treat
you
i
hardly
know
i
had
been
at
the
pains
to
look
them
up
since
the
thing
happened
and
i
had
been
carrying
their
squalid
secret
round
for
a
fortnight
and
suffering
from
it
as
if
it
were
all
my
atherton
smiled
at
the
touch
of
when
i
met
her
and
her
husband
and
her
baby
a
family
party
well
she
made
me
ashamed
of
the
melodramatic
compassion
i
had
been
feeling
for
her
it
seemed
that
i
had
been
going
about
unnecessarily
not
to
say
impertinently
haggard
with
the
recollection
of
her
face
as
i
saw
it
when
she
opened
the
door
for
her
blackguard
and
me
that
morning
she
looked
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
at
our
last
meeting
i
could
brace
up
all
at
once
i
behaved
like
a
sneak
in
view
of
her
perhaps
nothing
unusual
happened
suggested
atherton
no
that
theory
is
tenable
said
halleck
it
was
the
one
fact
in
the
blackguard
favor
that
she
had
evidently
never
seen
him
in
that
state
before
and
did
know
what
was
the
matter
she
was
wild
at
first
she
wanted
to
send
for
a
doctor
i
think
towards
the
last
she
began
to
suspect
but
i
do
know
how
she
looked
i
could
look
at
he
stopped
as
if
still
in
the
presence
of
the
pathetic
figure
with
its
sidelong
drooping
head
atherton
respected
his
silence
a
moment
before
he
again
suggested
as
lightly
as
before
perhaps
she
is
no
said
halleck
with
the
effect
of
having
also
given
that
theory
consideration
she
not
magnanimous
poor
soul
i
fancy
she
is
rather
a
person
with
strict
limitations
in
regard
to
people
who
think
ill
or
too
well
of
her
then
perhaps
said
atherton
with
the
air
of
having
exhausted
conjecture
she
i
have
tried
to
think
that
too
replied
halleck
but
i
ca
manage
it
no
there
are
only
two
ways
out
of
it
the
fellow
has
abused
her
innocence
and
made
her
believe
it
a
common
and
venial
affair
to
be
brought
home
in
that
state
or
else
she
playing
a
part
he
capable
of
telling
her
that
neither
you
nor
i
for
example
ever
go
to
bed
sober
but
she
is
obtuse
i
fancy
she
only
too
keen
in
all
the
sensibilities
that
women
suffer
through
and
i
rather
think
that
he
had
deluded
her
in
that
way
than
that
she
was
masquerading
about
it
or
she
strikes
me
as
an
uncommonly
truthful
person
i
suppose
you
know
whom
i
talking
about
atherton
he
said
with
a
sudden
look
at
his
friend
face
across
the
table
yes
i
know
said
the
lawyer
i
sorry
it
come
to
this
already
though
i
suppose
you
not
altogether
no
something
of
the
kind
was
to
be
expected
halleck
sighed
and
rolled
his
cane
up
and
down
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
i
hope
we
know
the
perhaps
we
do
but
i
recollect
a
wise
remark
you
made
the
first
time
we
talked
of
these
people
said
atherton
replying
to
the
mood
rather
than
the
speech
of
his
friend
you
suggested
that
we
rather
liked
to
grieve
over
the
pretty
girls
that
other
fellows
marry
and
that
we
never
thought
of
the
plain
ones
as
oh
i
had
any
data
for
my
pity
in
this
case
then
replied
halleck
i
willing
to
allow
that
a
plain
woman
would
suffer
under
the
same
circumstances
and
i
think
i
should
be
capable
of
pitying
her
but
confess
that
the
notion
of
a
pretty
woman
sorrow
is
more
intolerable
there
no
use
denying
a
fact
so
universally
recognized
by
the
male
consciousness
i
take
my
share
of
shame
for
it
i
wonder
why
it
is
pretty
women
always
seem
to
appeal
to
us
as
more
dependent
and
childlike
i
dare
say
they
some
of
them
are
quite
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
said
atherton
i
known
striking
instances
of
the
kind
how
do
you
know
but
the
object
of
your
superfluous
pity
was
cheerful
because
fate
had
delivered
her
husband
bound
forever
into
her
hand
through
this
little
escapade
of
his
is
that
rather
a
coarse
suggestion
asked
halleck
very
likely
i
suggest
it
i
do
assert
it
but
i
fancy
that
wives
sometimes
like
a
permanent
grievance
that
is
always
at
hand
no
matter
what
the
mere
passing
occasion
of
the
particular
disagreement
is
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
detected
obscure
appeals
to
such
a
weapon
in
domestic
interviews
at
which
i
assisted
in
the
way
of
do
atherton
cried
halleck
do
how
in
this
particular
case
or
in
regard
to
wives
generally
we
ca
do
women
a
greater
injustice
than
not
to
account
for
a
vast
deal
of
human
nature
in
them
you
may
be
sure
that
things
have
come
to
the
present
pass
with
those
people
without
blame
on
both
oh
do
you
defend
a
man
for
such
beastliness
by
that
stale
old
plea
of
blame
on
both
sides
demanded
halleck
indignantly
no
but
i
should
like
to
know
what
she
had
said
or
done
to
provoke
it
before
i
excused
her
you
would
imagine
the
case
it
is
you
think
there
is
a
special
code
of
morals
for
women
sins
and
shames
for
them
that
are
no
sins
and
shames
for
us
no
i
do
think
that
i
merely
suggest
that
you
do
idealize
the
victim
in
this
instance
i
dare
say
she
has
suffered
half
as
much
as
you
have
remember
that
she
a
person
of
commonplace
traditions
and
probably
took
a
simple
view
of
the
matter
and
let
it
go
as
something
that
could
not
be
no
that
would
not
do
either
said
halleck
you
hard
to
please
suppose
we
imagine
her
proud
enough
to
face
you
down
on
the
fact
for
his
sake
too
proud
to
revenge
her
disgrace
on
you
oh
you
come
back
to
your
old
plea
of
magnanimity
atherton
it
makes
me
sick
at
heart
to
think
of
that
poor
creature
that
look
of
hers
haunts
me
i
ca
get
rid
of
it
atherton
sat
considering
his
friend
with
a
curious
smile
well
i
sorry
this
has
happened
to
oh
why
do
you
say
that
to
me
demanded
halleck
impatiently
am
i
a
nervous
woman
that
i
must
be
kept
from
unpleasant
sights
and
disagreeable
experiences
if
there
anything
of
the
man
about
me
you
insult
it
why
not
be
a
little
sorry
for
i
sorry
enough
for
her
but
i
suspect
that
so
far
you
have
been
the
principal
sufferer
she
simply
accepted
the
fact
and
survived
so
much
the
worse
so
much
the
worse
groaned
halleck
she
better
have
died
well
perhaps
i
dare
say
she
thinks
it
will
never
happen
again
and
has
dismissed
the
subject
while
you
had
it
happening
ever
since
whenever
you
thought
of
halleck
struck
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
clinched
hands
confound
the
fellow
what
business
has
he
to
come
back
into
my
way
and
make
me
think
about
his
wife
oh
very
likely
it
quite
as
you
say
i
dare
say
stupidly
content
with
him
that
she
forgiven
it
and
forgotten
all
about
it
probably
she
told
him
how
i
behaved
and
they
laughed
me
over
together
but
does
that
make
it
any
easier
to
bear
it
ought
said
atherton
what
did
the
husband
do
when
you
met
them
everything
but
tip
me
the
wink
everything
but
say
in
so
many
words
see
i
made
it
all
right
with
her
do
you
wish
you
knew
how
halleck
dropped
his
head
with
a
wrathful
groan
i
fancy
said
atherton
thoughtfully
that
if
we
really
knew
how
it
would
surprise
us
married
life
is
as
much
a
mystery
to
us
outsiders
as
the
life
to
come
almost
the
ordinary
motives
do
seem
to
count
it
the
realm
of
unreason
if
a
man
only
makes
his
wife
suffer
enough
she
finds
out
that
she
loves
him
so
much
she
forgive
him
and
then
there
a
great
deal
in
their
being
bound
they
ca
live
together
in
enmity
and
they
must
live
together
i
dare
say
the
offence
had
merely
worn
itself
out
between
oh
i
dare
say
halleck
assented
wearily
that
is
my
idea
of
marriage
it
not
mine
either
returned
atherton
the
question
is
whether
it
is
often
the
fact
in
regard
to
such
people
then
they
are
so
many
hells
cried
halleck
where
perishes
with
resentment
and
the
husband
and
wife
are
enslaved
to
each
other
they
ought
to
be
broken
up
i
do
think
so
said
atherton
soberly
the
sort
of
men
and
women
that
marriage
enslaves
would
be
vastly
more
wretched
and
mischievous
if
they
were
set
free
i
believe
that
the
hell
people
make
for
themselves
is
at
all
a
bad
place
for
them
it
the
best
place
for
oh
i
know
your
doctrine
said
halleck
rising
it
horrible
how
a
man
with
any
kindness
in
his
heart
can
harbor
such
a
philosophy
do
understand
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
good
night
he
added
gloomily
taking
his
hat
from
the
table
it
serves
me
right
for
coming
to
you
with
a
matter
that
i
ought
to
have
been
man
enough
to
keep
to
atherton
followed
him
toward
the
door
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
to
consider
your
perplexity
in
the
light
of
my
philosophy
an
unhappy
marriage
is
the
only
hell
nor
the
halleck
turned
what
could
be
a
worse
hell
than
marriage
without
love
he
demanded
fiercely
love
without
marriage
said
atherton
halleck
looked
sharply
at
his
friend
then
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
turned
again
and
swung
out
of
the
door
you
too
esoteric
for
me
quite
time
i
was
the
way
through
clover
street
was
not
the
shortest
way
home
but
he
climbed
the
hill
and
passed
the
little
house
he
wished
to
rehabilitate
in
its
pathetic
beauty
the
image
which
his
friend
conjectures
had
jarred
distorted
insulted
and
he
lingered
for
a
moment
before
the
door
where
this
vision
had
claimed
his
pity
for
anguish
that
no
after
serenity
could
repudiate
the
silence
in
which
the
house
was
wrapped
was
like
another
fold
of
the
mystery
which
involved
him
the
night
wind
rose
in
a
sudden
gust
and
made
the
neighboring
lamp
flare
and
his
shadow
wavered
across
the
pavement
like
the
figure
of
a
drunken
man
this
and
not
that
other
was
the
image
which
he
saw
xxvii
of
course
said
marcia
when
she
and
bartley
recurred
to
the
subject
of
her
visit
to
equity
i
have
always
felt
as
if
i
should
like
to
have
you
with
me
so
as
to
keep
people
from
talking
and
show
that
it
all
right
between
you
and
father
but
if
you
do
wish
to
go
i
ca
ask
i
understand
what
you
mean
and
i
should
like
to
gratify
you
said
bartley
not
that
i
care
a
rap
what
all
the
people
in
equity
think
tell
you
what
i
do
i
go
down
there
with
you
and
hang
round
a
day
or
two
and
then
i
come
after
you
when
your
time
up
and
stay
a
day
or
two
there
i
stand
three
weeks
in
in
the
end
he
behaved
very
handsomely
he
dressed
flavia
out
to
kill
as
he
said
in
lace
hoods
and
embroidered
for
which
he
tossed
over
half
the
stock
of
the
great
stores
and
he
made
marcia
get
herself
a
new
suit
throughout
with
a
bonnet
to
match
which
she
thought
she
could
not
afford
but
he
said
he
should
manage
it
somehow
in
equity
he
spared
no
pains
to
deepen
the
impression
of
his
success
in
boston
and
he
was
affable
with
everybody
he
hailed
his
friends
across
the
street
waving
his
hand
to
them
and
shouting
out
a
jolly
greeting
he
visited
the
hotel
office
and
the
stores
to
meet
the
loungers
there
he
stepped
into
the
and
congratulated
henry
bird
on
having
stopped
the
free
press
and
devoted
himself
to
he
said
hello
marilla
hello
hannah
and
he
stood
a
good
while
beside
the
latter
at
her
case
joking
and
laughing
he
had
no
resentments
he
stopped
old
morrison
on
the
street
and
shook
hands
with
him
well
morrison
do
you
find
it
as
easy
to
get
hannah
wages
advanced
nowadays
as
you
used
to
as
for
his
relations
with
squire
gaylord
he
flattened
public
conjecture
out
like
a
pancake
as
he
told
marcia
by
making
the
old
gentleman
walk
with
him
the
whole
length
of
the
village
street
the
morning
after
his
arrival
and
i
never
saw
your
honored
father
look
as
if
he
enjoyed
a
thing
less
added
bartley
well
what
the
use
he
help
they
had
arrived
on
friday
evening
and
after
spending
saturday
in
this
social
way
bartley
magnanimously
went
with
marcia
to
church
he
was
in
good
spirits
and
he
shook
hands
right
and
left
as
he
came
out
of
church
in
the
afternoon
he
had
up
the
best
team
from
the
hotel
stable
and
took
marcia
the
long
drive
which
they
had
taken
the
day
of
their
engagement
he
could
not
be
contented
without
pushing
the
perambulator
out
after
tea
and
making
marcia
walk
beside
it
to
let
people
see
them
with
the
baby
he
went
away
the
next
morning
on
an
early
train
after
a
parting
which
he
made
very
cheery
and
a
promise
to
come
down
again
as
soon
as
he
could
manage
it
marcia
watched
him
drive
off
toward
the
station
in
the
hotel
barge
and
then
she
went
upstairs
to
their
room
where
she
had
been
so
long
a
young
girl
and
where
now
their
child
lay
sleeping
the
little
one
seemed
the
least
part
of
all
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
this
room
she
used
to
sit
and
think
of
him
she
used
to
fly
up
thither
when
he
came
unexpectedly
and
order
her
hair
or
change
a
ribbon
of
her
dress
that
she
might
please
him
better
at
these
windows
she
used
to
sit
and
watch
and
long
for
his
coming
from
these
she
saw
him
go
by
that
day
when
she
thought
she
should
see
him
no
more
and
took
heart
of
her
despair
to
risk
the
wild
chance
that
made
him
hers
there
was
a
deadly
unsympathetic
stillness
in
the
room
which
seemed
to
leave
to
her
all
the
responsibility
for
what
she
had
done
the
days
began
to
go
by
in
a
sunny
still
midsummer
monotony
she
pushed
the
baby
out
in
its
carriage
and
saw
the
summer
boarders
walking
or
driving
through
the
streets
she
returned
the
visits
that
the
neighbors
paid
her
indoors
she
helped
her
mother
about
the
housework
an
image
of
her
maiden
life
reinstated
itself
at
times
it
seemed
almost
as
if
she
had
dreamed
her
marriage
when
she
looked
at
her
baby
in
these
moods
she
thought
she
was
dreaming
yet
a
young
wife
suddenly
parted
for
the
first
time
from
her
husband
in
whose
intense
possession
she
has
lost
her
individual
existence
and
devolving
upon
her
old
separate
personality
must
have
strong
fancies
strange
sensations
marcia
marriage
had
been
full
of
such
shocks
and
storms
as
might
well
have
left
her
dazed
in
their
entire
cessation
she
seems
to
be
pretty
well
satisfied
here
said
her
father
one
evening
when
she
had
gone
upstairs
with
her
sleeping
baby
in
her
arms
she
seems
to
be
pretty
quiet
her
mother
noncommittally
assented
snarled
the
squire
and
he
fell
into
a
long
revery
while
gaylord
went
on
crocheting
the
baby
a
bib
and
the
smell
of
the
under
the
window
came
in
through
the
mosquito
netting
he
resumed
i
guess
you
right
i
guess
it
only
quiet
i
guess
she
ai
any
more
likely
to
be
satisfied
than
the
rest
of
i
do
see
why
she
should
be
said
gaylord
resenting
the
compassion
in
the
squire
tone
with
that
curious
jealousy
a
wife
feels
for
her
husband
indulgence
of
their
daughter
she
had
her
she
had
her
way
poor
girl
yes
but
i
do
know
as
it
satisfies
people
to
have
their
way
doubtless
gaylord
saw
that
her
husband
wished
to
talk
about
marcia
and
must
be
helped
to
do
so
by
a
little
perverseness
i
do
know
but
what
most
of
folks
would
say
she
made
out
pretty
well
i
guess
got
a
good
she
did
need
any
provider
said
the
squire
haughtily
no
but
so
long
as
she
would
have
something
it
well
enough
that
she
should
have
a
gaylord
felt
that
this
was
reasoning
and
she
smoothed
out
so
much
of
the
bib
as
she
had
crocheted
across
her
knees
with
an
air
of
you
ca
have
everything
in
a
husband
she
added
and
marcia
ought
to
know
that
by
this
i
no
doubt
she
knows
it
said
the
squire
why
what
makes
you
think
she
disappointed
any
gaylord
came
plump
to
the
question
at
last
nothing
she
ever
said
returned
her
husband
promptly
she
die
first
when
i
was
up
there
i
thought
she
talked
about
him
too
much
to
be
feeling
just
right
about
him
it
was
bartley
this
and
bartley
that
the
whole
while
she
was
always
wanting
me
to
say
that
i
thought
she
had
done
right
to
marry
him
i
sort
of
say
it
at
last
to
please
her
but
i
kept
thinking
that
if
she
felt
sure
of
it
she
would
want
to
talk
it
into
me
so
now
she
never
mentions
him
at
all
if
she
can
help
it
she
writes
to
him
every
day
and
she
hears
from
him
often
enough
postals
mostly
but
she
do
talk
about
bartley
bartley
the
squire
stretched
his
lips
back
from
his
teeth
and
inhaled
a
long
breath
as
he
rubbed
his
chin
you
do
suppose
anything
happened
since
you
was
up
there
said
gaylord
nothing
but
what
happened
from
the
start
happened
he
keeps
happening
right
along
i
gaylord
found
herself
upon
the
point
of
experiencing
a
painful
emotion
of
sympathy
but
she
saved
herself
by
saying
well
gaylord
i
know
as
you
got
anybody
but
yourself
to
thank
for
it
all
you
got
him
here
in
the
first
she
took
one
of
the
kerosene
lamps
from
the
table
and
went
upstairs
leaving
him
to
follow
at
his
will
marcia
sometimes
went
out
to
the
squire
office
in
the
morning
carrying
her
baby
with
her
and
propping
her
with
on
a
newspaper
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
while
she
dusted
the
shelves
or
sat
down
for
one
of
the
desultory
talks
in
the
satisfactory
silences
which
she
had
with
her
father
he
usually
found
her
there
when
he
came
up
from
the
with
the
morning
mail
in
the
top
of
his
hat
the
last
evening
events
which
bartley
had
said
must
pass
for
a
letter
from
him
when
he
did
not
write
and
a
letter
or
a
postal
card
from
him
she
read
these
and
gave
her
lather
any
news
or
message
that
bartley
sent
and
then
she
sat
down
at
his
table
to
answer
them
but
one
morning
after
she
had
been
at
home
nearly
a
month
she
received
a
letter
for
which
she
postponed
postal
it
from
olive
halleck
she
said
with
a
glance
at
the
handwriting
on
the
envelope
and
she
tore
it
open
and
ran
it
through
yes
and
they
come
here
any
time
i
let
them
know
they
been
at
niagara
and
they
come
down
the
lawrence
to
quebec
and
they
will
be
at
north
conway
the
last
of
next
week
now
father
i
want
to
do
something
for
them
she
cried
feeling
an
american
daughter
right
to
dispose
of
her
father
and
all
his
possessions
for
the
behoof
of
her
friends
at
any
time
i
want
they
should
come
to
the
well
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
trouble
about
that
if
you
think
they
can
put
up
with
our
way
of
living
he
smiled
at
her
over
his
spectacles
our
way
of
living
put
up
with
it
i
should
hope
as
much
they
just
the
kind
of
people
that
will
put
up
with
anything
because
they
had
everything
and
because
they
all
as
sweet
and
good
as
they
can
be
you
do
know
them
father
you
do
half
know
them
now
just
get
right
away
she
pushed
him
out
of
the
chair
he
had
taken
at
the
table
and
let
me
write
to
bartley
this
instant
he
got
to
come
when
they
here
and
i
invite
them
to
come
over
at
once
before
they
get
settled
at
north
he
gave
his
dry
chuckle
to
see
her
so
fired
with
pleasure
and
he
enjoyed
the
ardor
with
which
she
drove
him
up
out
of
his
chair
and
dashed
off
her
letters
this
was
her
old
way
he
would
have
liked
the
prospect
of
the
hallecks
coming
because
it
made
his
girl
so
happy
if
for
nothing
else
father
i
will
tell
you
about
ben
halleck
she
said
pounding
her
letter
to
olive
with
the
thick
of
her
hand
to
make
the
envelope
stick
you
know
that
lameness
of
his
well
it
came
from
his
being
thrown
down
by
another
boy
when
he
was
at
school
he
knew
the
boy
that
did
it
and
the
boy
must
have
known
that
halleck
knew
it
but
he
never
said
a
word
to
show
that
he
was
sorry
or
did
anything
to
make
up
for
it
he
a
man
now
and
lives
there
in
boston
and
ben
halleck
often
meets
him
he
says
that
if
the
man
can
stand
it
he
can
do
you
think
that
grand
when
i
heard
that
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
wanted
flavia
to
belong
to
ben
halleck
church
or
the
church
he
did
belong
to
he
does
belong
to
any
now
he
could
have
got
any
damages
for
such
a
thing
anyway
the
squire
said
marcia
paid
no
heed
to
this
legal
opinion
of
the
case
she
took
off
her
father
hat
to
put
the
letters
into
it
and
replacing
it
on
his
head
now
do
you
forget
them
father
she
cried
she
gathered
up
her
baby
and
hurried
into
the
house
where
she
began
her
preparations
for
her
guests
the
elder
miss
hallecks
had
announced
with
much
love
through
olive
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
come
to
equity
and
ben
was
to
bring
olive
alone
marcia
decided
that
ben
should
have
the
and
olive
should
have
her
room
she
and
bartley
could
take
the
little
room
in
the
l
while
their
guests
remained
but
when
the
hallecks
came
it
appeared
that
ben
had
engaged
quarters
for
himself
at
the
hotel
and
no
expostulation
would
prevail
with
him
to
come
to
squire
gaylord
house
we
have
to
humor
him
in
such
things
hubbard
olive
explained
to
marcia
distress
and
most
people
get
on
very
well
without
this
explanation
was
of
course
given
in
halleck
presence
his
sister
added
behind
his
back
ben
has
a
perfectly
morbid
dread
of
giving
trouble
in
a
house
he
wo
let
us
do
anything
to
make
him
comfortable
at
home
and
the
idea
that
you
should
attempt
it
drove
him
distracted
you
mind
it
i
do
believe
he
have
come
if
his
bachelor
freedom
have
been
respected
and
we
both
wanted
to
come
very
the
hallecks
arrived
in
the
forenoon
and
bartley
was
due
in
the
evening
but
during
the
afternoon
marcia
had
a
telegram
saying
that
he
could
not
come
till
two
days
later
and
asking
her
to
postpone
the
picnic
she
had
planned
the
hallecks
were
only
going
to
stay
three
days
and
the
suspicion
that
bartley
had
delayed
in
order
to
leave
himself
as
little
time
as
possible
with
them
rankled
in
her
heart
so
that
she
could
not
keep
it
to
herself
when
they
met
was
that
what
made
you
give
me
such
a
cool
reception
he
asked
with
cynical
well
you
mistaken
i
do
suppose
i
mind
the
hallecks
any
more
than
they
do
me
i
tell
you
why
i
stayed
some
people
dropped
down
on
witherby
who
were
a
little
out
of
his
line
fashionable
people
that
he
had
asked
to
let
him
know
if
they
ever
came
to
boston
and
when
they
did
come
and
let
him
know
he
did
know
what
to
do
about
it
and
he
called
on
me
to
help
him
out
i
been
almost
boarding
with
witherby
for
the
last
three
days
and
i
been
barouching
round
all
over
the
moral
vineyard
with
his
friends
out
to
mount
auburn
and
the
washington
elm
and
bunker
hill
and
brookline
and
the
art
museum
and
lexington
we
been
down
the
harbor
and
we
have
left
a
monumental
stone
unturned
they
were
going
north
and
they
came
down
here
with
me
and
i
got
them
to
stop
over
a
day
for
the
you
got
them
to
stop
over
for
the
picnic
why
i
do
want
anybody
but
ourselves
bartley
this
spoils
the
hallecks
are
not
ourselves
said
bartley
and
these
are
jolly
people
they
help
to
make
it
go
who
are
they
asked
marcia
with
provisional
oh
some
people
that
witherby
met
in
portland
at
willett
who
used
to
have
the
out
that
montreal
woman
cried
marcia
with
fatal
divination
bartley
laughed
yes
macallister
and
her
husband
she
a
regular
case
she
amuse
marcia
passionate
eyes
blazed
she
shall
never
come
to
my
picnic
in
the
world
no
bartley
looked
at
her
in
a
certain
way
she
shall
come
to
mine
then
there
will
be
two
picnics
the
more
the
marcia
gasped
as
if
she
felt
the
clutch
in
which
her
husband
had
her
tightening
on
her
heart
she
said
that
she
could
only
carry
her
point
against
him
at
the
cost
of
disgraceful
division
before
the
hallecks
for
which
he
would
not
care
in
the
least
she
moved
her
head
a
little
from
side
to
side
like
one
that
breathes
a
stifling
air
oh
let
her
come
she
said
quietly
at
last
now
you
talking
business
said
bartley
i
have
forgotten
the
little
snub
macallister
gave
me
and
you
see
me
pay
her
marcia
made
no
answer
but
went
downstairs
to
put
what
face
she
could
upon
the
matter
to
olive
whom
she
had
left
alone
in
the
parlor
while
she
ran
up
with
bartley
immediately
upon
his
arrival
to
demand
an
explanation
of
him
in
her
wrathful
haste
she
had
forgotten
to
kiss
him
and
she
now
remembered
that
he
had
not
looked
at
the
baby
which
she
had
all
the
time
had
in
her
arms
the
picnic
was
to
be
in
a
pretty
glen
three
or
four
miles
north
of
the
village
where
there
was
shade
on
a
bit
of
level
green
and
a
spring
bubbling
out
of
a
bluff
from
which
you
looked
down
the
glen
over
a
stretch
of
the
river
marcia
had
planned
that
they
were
to
drive
thither
in
a
carryall
but
the
addition
of
bartley
guests
disarranged
this
there
only
one
way
said
macallister
who
had
driven
up
with
her
husband
from
the
hotel
to
the
squire
house
in
a
buggy
mr
halleck
tells
me
he
does
know
how
to
drive
and
my
husband
does
know
the
way
hubbard
must
get
in
here
with
me
and
you
must
take
macallister
in
your
she
looked
authoritatively
at
the
others
first
rate
cried
bartley
climbing
to
the
seat
which
macallister
left
vacant
we
lead
the
those
who
followed
had
difficulty
in
keeping
their
buggy
in
sight
sometimes
bartley
stopped
long
enough
for
them
to
come
up
and
then
after
a
word
or
two
of
gay
banter
was
off
again
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
picnic
grounds
and
macallister
was
disposing
shawls
for
rugs
and
drapery
while
bartley
who
had
got
the
horse
out
and
tethered
where
he
could
graze
was
pushing
the
buggy
out
of
the
way
by
the
shafts
when
the
carryall
came
up
do
we
look
quite
domestic
she
asked
of
the
arriving
company
in
her
neat
english
tone
and
her
rising
english
inflection
you
know
i
like
this
she
added
singling
halleck
out
for
her
remark
and
making
it
as
if
it
were
brilliant
i
like
being
out
of
doors
do
you
know
but
one
thing
i
do
like
we
were
able
to
get
a
drop
of
champagne
at
that
ridiculous
hotel
they
told
us
they
were
not
allowed
to
keep
liquors
now
i
call
that
jolly
stupid
you
know
i
do
know
whatever
we
shall
do
if
you
have
brought
i
believe
this
is
a
famous
spring
said
halleck
how
droll
you
are
spring
indeed
cried
macallister
is
the
way
you
let
your
brother
make
game
of
people
miss
halleck
she
directed
a
good
deal
of
her
rattle
at
olive
she
scarcely
spoke
to
marcia
but
she
was
nevertheless
furtively
observant
of
her
macallister
had
his
rattle
too
which
after
trying
it
unsatisfactorily
upon
marcia
he
plied
almost
exclusively
for
olive
he
made
puns
he
asked
conundrums
he
had
all
the
accomplishments
which
keep
people
going
in
a
lively
mirthful
colonial
society
and
he
had
the
idea
that
he
must
pay
attentions
and
promote
repartee
his
wife
and
he
played
into
each
other
hands
in
their
and
kept
olive
inquiring
boston
mind
at
work
in
the
vain
endeavor
to
account
for
and
to
place
them
socially
bartley
hung
about
macallister
and
was
nearly
as
obedient
as
her
husband
he
felt
that
the
hallecks
disapproved
his
behavior
and
that
made
him
enjoy
it
he
was
almost
rudely
negligent
of
olive
the
composition
of
the
party
left
marcia
and
halleck
necessarily
to
each
other
and
she
accepted
this
arrangement
in
a
sort
of
passive
seriousness
but
halleck
saw
that
her
thoughts
wandered
from
her
talk
with
him
and
that
her
eyes
were
always
turning
with
painful
anxiety
to
bartley
after
their
lunch
which
left
them
with
the
whole
afternoon
before
them
marcia
said
in
a
timid
effort
to
resume
her
best
leadership
of
the
affair
bartley
do
you
think
they
would
like
to
see
the
view
from
the
devil
backbone
would
you
like
to
see
the
view
from
the
devil
backbone
he
asked
in
turn
of
macallister
and
is
the
devil
backbone
she
inquired
it
a
ridge
of
rocks
on
the
bluff
above
here
said
bartley
nodding
his
head
vaguely
towards
the
bank
and
do
you
get
to
it
asked
macallister
pointing
her
pretty
chin
at
him
in
lifting
her
head
to
look
thanks
then
i
shall
try
to
be
satisfied
with
me
own
backbone
said
macallister
who
had
that
freedom
in
alluding
to
her
anatomy
which
marks
the
superior
civilization
of
great
britain
and
its
colonial
dependencies
carry
you
suggested
bartley
i
dare
say
you
be
very
but
i
quite
enough
of
donkeys
in
the
hills
at
bartley
roared
with
the
resolution
of
a
man
who
will
enjoy
a
joke
at
his
own
expense
marcia
turned
away
and
referred
her
invitation
with
a
glance
to
olive
i
do
believe
miss
halleck
wants
to
go
said
macallister
i
could
said
olive
regretfully
i
neither
the
feet
nor
the
head
for
climbing
over
high
rocky
marcia
was
about
to
sink
down
on
the
grass
again
from
which
she
had
risen
in
the
hopes
that
her
proposition
would
succeed
when
bartley
called
out
why
do
you
show
ben
the
devil
backbone
the
view
is
worth
seeing
would
you
like
to
go
asked
marcia
listlessly
yes
i
should
very
much
said
halleck
scrambling
to
his
feet
if
it
wo
tire
you
too
much
oh
no
said
marcia
gently
and
led
the
way
she
kept
ahead
of
him
in
the
climb
as
she
easily
could
and
she
answered
briefly
to
all
he
said
when
they
arrived
at
the
top
there
is
the
view
she
said
coldly
she
waved
her
hand
toward
the
valley
she
made
a
sound
in
her
throat
as
if
she
would
speak
again
but
her
voice
died
in
one
broken
sob
halleck
stood
with
downcast
eyes
and
trembled
he
durst
not
look
at
her
not
for
what
he
should
see
in
her
face
but
for
what
she
should
see
in
his
the
anguish
of
intelligence
the
helpless
pity
he
beat
the
rock
at
his
feet
with
the
ferule
of
his
stick
and
could
not
lift
his
head
again
when
he
did
she
stood
turned
from
him
and
drying
her
eyes
on
her
handkerchief
their
looks
met
and
she
trusted
her
to
him
without
any
attempt
at
excuse
or
explanation
i
will
send
hubbard
up
to
help
you
down
said
halleck
well
she
answered
sadly
he
clambered
down
the
side
of
the
bluff
and
bartley
started
to
his
feet
in
guilty
alarm
when
he
saw
him
approach
what
the
matter
nothing
but
i
think
you
had
better
help
hubbard
down
the
oh
cried
macallister
a
panic
how
interesting
halleck
did
not
respond
he
threw
himself
on
the
grass
and
left
her
to
change
or
pursue
the
subject
as
she
liked
bartley
showed
more
when
he
came
back
with
marcia
after
an
absence
long
enough
to
let
her
remove
the
traces
of
her
tears
pretty
rough
on
your
game
foot
halleck
but
marcia
had
got
it
into
her
head
that
it
was
safe
to
trust
you
to
help
her
down
even
after
you
had
helped
her
ben
said
olive
when
they
were
seated
in
the
train
the
next
day
why
you
send
marcia
husband
up
there
to
her
she
had
the
effect
of
not
having
rested
till
she
could
ask
him
she
was
crying
he
answered
what
do
you
suppose
could
have
been
the
matter
what
you
do
she
was
miserable
about
his
coquetting
with
that
yes
i
could
see
that
she
hated
terribly
to
have
her
come
and
that
she
felt
put
down
by
her
all
the
time
what
kind
of
person
macallister
oh
a
fool
replied
halleck
all
flirts
are
i
think
she
more
wicked
than
oh
no
flirts
are
better
than
they
seem
perhaps
because
men
are
better
than
flirts
think
but
they
make
misery
just
the
yes
sighed
olive
poor
marcia
poor
marcia
but
i
suppose
that
if
it
were
not
macallister
it
would
be
some
one
given
bartley
hubbard
and
given
marcia
well
i
do
like
being
mixed
up
with
other
unhappiness
ben
it
i
do
like
it
either
but
you
ca
very
well
keep
out
of
unhappiness
in
this
no
assented
olive
ruefully
the
talk
fell
and
halleck
attempted
to
read
a
newspaper
while
olive
looked
out
of
the
window
she
presently
turned
to
him
did
you
ever
fancy
any
resemblance
between
hubbard
and
the
photograph
of
that
girl
we
used
to
joke
about
your
lost
love
yes
said
halleck
what
become
of
it
the
photograph
i
ca
find
it
any
more
i
wanted
to
show
it
to
her
one
i
destroyed
it
i
burnt
it
the
first
evening
after
i
had
met
hubbard
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
right
to
keep
why
you
do
think
it
was
photograph
i
think
it
was
said
halleck
he
took
up
his
paper
again
and
read
on
till
they
left
the
cars
that
evening
when
halleck
came
to
his
sister
room
to
bid
her
good
night
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
his
plain
common
face
in
which
she
saw
a
heavenly
beauty
ben
dear
she
said
if
you
do
turn
out
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
i
shall
say
there
no
use
in
being
good
perhaps
you
better
say
that
after
all
i
was
good
he
suggested
with
a
melancholy
smile
i
shall
know
better
she
retorted
why
what
the
matter
now
nothing
i
was
only
thinking
good
night
good
night
said
halleck
you
seem
to
think
my
room
is
better
than
my
company
good
as
i
yes
she
said
laughing
in
that
breathless
way
which
means
weeping
next
with
women
her
eyes
glistened
well
said
halleck
limping
out
of
the
room
you
quite
with
your
hair
down
all
girls
are
she
answered
she
leaned
out
of
her
doorway
to
watch
him
as
he
limped
down
the
corridor
to
his
own
room
there
was
something
pathetic
something
disappointed
and
weary
in
the
movement
of
his
figure
and
when
she
shut
her
door
and
ran
back
to
her
mirror
she
could
not
see
the
girl
there
for
her
tears
xxviii
hello
said
bartley
one
day
after
the
autumn
had
brought
back
all
the
summer
wanderers
to
the
city
i
have
seen
you
for
a
month
of
he
had
ricker
by
the
hand
and
he
pulled
him
into
a
doorway
to
be
a
little
out
of
the
rush
on
the
crowded
pavement
while
they
chatted
that
because
i
ca
afford
to
go
to
the
white
mountains
and
swell
round
at
the
aristocratic
summer
resorts
like
some
people
returned
ricker
i
a
son
of
toil
pshaw
said
bartley
who
is
i
been
here
hard
at
it
except
for
three
days
at
one
time
and
live
at
well
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
saw
in
the
record
personals
that
hubbard
of
the
events
was
spending
the
summer
months
with
his
judge
gaylord
among
the
spurs
of
the
white
mountains
i
supposed
you
wrote
it
yourself
you
full
of
ideas
about
oh
come
i
would
work
that
joke
any
more
look
here
ricker
i
tell
you
what
i
want
i
want
you
to
dine
with
dines
people
said
ricker
in
an
awestricken
aside
no
i
mean
business
you
ve
never
seen
my
kid
yet
and
you
never
seen
my
house
i
want
you
to
come
we
all
got
back
and
we
in
nice
running
order
what
day
are
you
disengaged
let
me
see
said
ricker
thoughtfully
so
many
engagements
wait
i
could
squeeze
your
dinner
in
some
time
next
month
all
right
but
suppose
we
say
next
sunday
six
is
the
six
oh
i
ca
dine
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
that
way
make
it
later
well
we
say
one
then
i
know
your
dinner
hour
we
shall
expect
better
not
till
i
bartley
knew
that
this
was
ricker
way
of
accepting
and
he
said
nothing
but
he
answered
his
next
question
with
easy
joviality
how
are
you
making
it
with
old
witherby
oh
hand
over
hand
witherby
and
i
were
formed
for
each
other
by
by
no
hold
on
why
do
you
come
to
the
club
any
more
the
club
is
what
it
used
to
be
said
bartley
confidentially
why
of
course
it
is
just
the
thing
for
a
gentleman
moving
in
the
select
circles
of
clover
street
as
you
do
but
why
not
come
sometimes
in
the
character
of
distinguished
guest
and
encourage
your
humble
friends
i
was
talking
with
a
lot
of
the
fellows
about
you
the
other
were
they
abusing
me
they
were
speaking
the
truth
about
you
and
i
stopped
them
i
told
them
that
sort
of
thing
would
do
why
you
getting
fat
you
behind
the
times
kicker
said
bartley
i
began
to
get
fat
six
months
ago
i
do
wonder
the
chronicle
abstract
is
running
down
on
your
hands
come
round
and
try
my
tivoli
on
sunday
that
what
gives
a
man
girth
my
he
tapped
ricker
lightly
on
his
hollow
waistcoat
and
left
him
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
ricker
leaned
out
of
the
doorway
and
followed
him
down
the
street
with
a
troubled
eye
he
had
taken
stock
in
bartley
as
the
saying
is
and
his
heart
misgave
him
that
he
should
lose
on
the
investment
he
could
not
have
sold
out
to
any
of
their
friends
for
twenty
cents
on
the
dollar
nothing
that
any
one
could
lay
his
finger
on
had
happened
and
yet
there
had
been
a
general
loss
of
confidence
in
that
particular
stock
ricker
himself
had
lost
confidence
in
it
and
when
he
lightly
mentioned
that
talk
at
the
club
with
a
lot
of
the
fellows
he
had
a
serious
wish
to
get
at
bartley
some
time
and
see
what
it
was
that
was
beginning
to
make
people
mistrust
him
the
fellows
who
liked
him
at
first
and
wished
him
well
and
believed
in
his
talent
had
mostly
dropped
him
bartley
associates
were
now
the
most
raffish
set
on
the
press
or
the
green
hands
and
something
had
brought
this
to
pass
in
less
than
two
years
ricker
had
believed
that
it
was
witherby
at
the
club
he
had
contended
that
it
was
bartley
association
with
witherby
that
made
people
doubtful
of
him
as
for
those
ideas
that
bartley
had
advanced
in
their
discussion
of
journalism
he
had
considered
it
all
mere
young
man
nonsense
that
bartley
would
outgrow
but
now
as
he
looked
at
bartley
back
he
had
his
misgivings
it
struck
him
as
the
back
of
a
degenerate
man
and
that
increasing
bulk
seemed
not
to
represent
an
increase
of
wholesome
substance
but
a
corky
buoyant
tissue
materially
responsive
to
some
sort
of
moral
bartley
pushed
on
to
the
events
office
in
a
blithe
humor
witherby
had
recently
advanced
his
salary
he
was
giving
him
fifty
dollars
a
week
now
and
bartley
had
made
himself
necessary
in
more
ways
than
one
he
was
not
only
readily
serviceable
but
since
he
had
volunteered
to
write
those
advertising
articles
for
an
advance
of
pay
he
was
in
possession
of
business
facts
that
could
be
made
very
uncomfortable
to
witherby
in
the
event
of
a
disagreement
witherby
not
only
paid
him
well
but
treated
him
well
he
even
suffered
bartley
to
bully
him
a
little
and
let
him
foresee
the
day
when
he
must
be
recognized
as
the
real
editor
of
the
events
at
home
everything
went
on
smoothly
the
baby
was
well
and
growing
fast
she
was
beginning
to
explode
airy
bubbles
on
her
pretty
lips
that
a
fond
superstition
might
interpret
as
papa
and
mamma
she
had
passed
that
stage
in
which
a
man
regards
his
child
with
despair
she
had
passed
out
of
slippery
and
evasive
doughiness
into
a
firm
tangibility
that
made
it
some
pleasure
to
hold
her
bartley
liked
to
take
her
on
his
lap
to
feel
the
spring
of
her
little
legs
as
she
tried
to
rise
on
her
feet
he
liked
to
have
her
stretch
out
her
arms
to
him
from
her
mother
embrace
the
innocent
tenderness
which
he
experienced
at
these
moments
was
satisfactory
proof
to
him
that
he
was
a
very
good
fellow
if
not
a
good
man
when
he
spent
an
evening
at
home
with
flavia
in
his
lap
for
half
an
hour
after
dinner
he
felt
so
domestic
that
he
seemed
to
himself
to
be
spending
all
his
evenings
at
home
now
once
or
twice
it
had
happened
when
the
housemaid
was
out
that
he
went
to
the
door
with
the
baby
on
his
arm
and
answered
the
ring
of
olive
and
ben
halleck
or
of
olive
and
one
or
both
of
the
intermediary
sisters
the
hallecks
were
the
only
people
at
all
apt
to
call
in
the
evening
and
bartley
ran
so
little
chance
of
meeting
any
one
else
when
he
opened
the
door
with
flavia
on
his
arm
that
probably
he
would
not
have
thought
it
worth
while
to
put
her
down
even
if
he
had
not
rather
enjoyed
meeting
them
in
that
domestic
phase
he
had
not
only
long
felt
how
intensely
olive
disliked
him
but
he
had
observed
that
somehow
it
embarrassed
ben
halleck
to
see
him
in
his
character
of
devoted
young
father
at
those
times
he
used
to
rally
his
old
friend
upon
getting
married
and
laughed
at
the
confusion
to
which
the
joke
put
him
he
said
more
than
once
afterwards
that
he
did
not
see
what
fun
ben
halleck
got
out
of
coming
there
it
must
bore
even
such
a
dull
fellow
as
he
was
to
sit
a
whole
evening
like
that
and
not
say
twenty
words
perhaps
he
livelier
when
i
not
here
though
he
suggested
i
always
did
seem
to
throw
a
wet
blanket
on
ben
he
did
not
at
all
begrudge
halleck
having
a
better
time
in
his
absence
if
he
could
one
night
when
the
bell
rung
bartley
rose
and
saying
i
wonder
which
of
the
tribe
it
is
this
time
went
to
the
door
but
when
he
opened
it
instead
of
hearing
the
voices
marcia
listened
through
a
hesitating
silence
which
ended
in
a
loud
laugh
from
without
and
a
cry
from
her
husband
of
well
i
swear
why
you
infamous
old
scoundrel
come
in
out
of
the
wet
there
ensued
amidst
bartley
voluble
greetings
a
noise
of
shy
shuffling
about
in
the
hall
as
of
a
man
not
perfectly
master
of
his
footing
under
social
pressure
a
sound
of
husky
embarrassed
whispering
a
dispute
about
doffing
an
overcoat
and
question
as
to
the
disposition
of
a
hat
and
then
bartley
reappeared
driving
before
him
the
lank
long
figure
of
a
man
who
blinked
in
the
flash
of
gaslight
as
bartley
turned
it
all
up
in
the
chandelier
overhead
and
rubbed
his
immense
hands
in
cruel
embarrassment
at
the
beauty
of
marcia
set
like
a
jewel
in
the
pretty
comfort
of
the
little
parlor
mr
kinney
hubbard
said
bartley
and
having
accomplished
the
introduction
he
hit
kinney
a
thwack
between
the
shoulders
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
that
drove
him
stumbling
across
marcia
footstool
into
the
seat
on
the
sofa
to
which
she
had
pointed
him
you
old
fool
where
did
you
come
from
the
refined
warmth
of
bartley
welcome
seemed
to
make
kinney
feel
at
home
in
spite
of
his
trepidations
at
marcia
presence
he
bobbed
his
head
forward
and
stretched
his
mouth
wide
in
one
of
his
vast
silent
laughs
better
ask
where
i
goin
well
i
ask
that
if
it
be
any
accommodation
where
you
going
for
a
divorce
try
to
get
married
maybe
after
i
made
my
kinney
eyes
wandered
about
the
room
and
took
in
its
evidences
of
prosperity
with
simple
unenvious
admiration
he
ended
with
a
furtive
glimpse
of
marcia
who
seemed
to
be
a
climax
of
good
luck
too
dazzling
for
contemplation
he
withdrew
his
glance
from
her
as
if
hurt
by
her
splendor
and
became
serious
well
you
the
man
i
ever
expected
to
see
again
said
bartley
sitting
down
with
the
baby
in
his
lap
and
contemplating
kinney
with
deliberation
kinney
was
dressed
in
a
long
of
cheap
diagonals
black
cassimere
pantaloons
a
blue
necktie
and
a
celluloid
collar
he
had
evidently
had
one
of
his
encounters
with
a
cheap
clothier
in
which
the
jew
had
triumphed
but
he
had
not
yet
visited
a
barber
and
his
hair
and
beard
were
as
shaggy
as
they
were
in
the
his
hands
and
face
were
as
brown
as
leather
but
i
as
glad
bartley
added
as
if
you
had
telegraphed
you
were
coming
of
course
you
going
to
put
up
with
he
had
observed
kinney
awe
of
marcia
and
he
added
this
touch
to
let
kinney
see
that
he
was
master
in
his
house
and
lord
even
of
that
radiant
presence
kinney
started
in
real
distress
oh
no
i
could
do
it
i
got
all
my
things
round
at
the
quincy
trunk
or
bag
asked
bartley
well
it
a
bag
but
all
right
we
step
round
and
get
it
together
i
generally
take
a
little
stroll
out
after
dinner
said
bartley
tranquilly
kinney
was
beginning
again
when
marcia
who
had
been
stealing
some
covert
looks
at
him
under
her
eye
lashes
while
she
put
together
the
sewing
she
was
at
work
on
preparatory
to
going
upstairs
with
the
baby
joined
bartley
in
his
invitation
you
wont
make
us
the
least
trouble
kinney
she
said
the
is
all
ready
and
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
you
kinney
must
have
felt
the
note
of
sincerity
in
her
words
he
hesitated
and
bartley
clinched
his
tacit
assent
with
a
quotation
chief
ornament
of
a
house
is
the
guests
who
frequent
it
who
says
that
kinney
little
blue
eyes
twinkled
old
well
i
agree
with
him
we
do
care
anything
about
your
company
kinney
but
we
want
you
for
decorative
kinney
opened
his
mouth
for
another
noiseless
laugh
and
said
well
fix
it
to
suit
i
carry
her
up
for
you
said
bartley
to
marcia
who
was
stooping
forward
to
take
the
baby
from
him
if
kinney
will
excuse
us
a
all
right
said
kinney
bartley
ventured
upon
this
bold
move
because
he
had
found
that
it
was
always
best
to
have
things
out
with
marcia
at
once
and
if
she
was
going
to
take
his
hospitality
to
kinney
in
bad
part
he
wanted
to
get
through
the
trouble
that
was
very
nice
of
you
marcia
he
said
when
they
were
in
their
own
room
my
invitation
rather
slipped
out
and
i
did
know
how
you
would
like
oh
i
very
glad
to
have
him
stay
i
never
forget
about
his
wanting
to
lend
you
money
that
time
said
marcia
opening
the
baby
crib
you
a
mighty
good
fellow
marcia
cried
bartley
kissing
her
over
the
top
of
the
baby
head
as
she
took
it
from
him
and
i
not
half
good
enough
for
you
you
never
forget
a
benefit
nor
an
injury
either
he
added
with
a
laugh
and
i
afraid
that
i
forget
one
about
as
easily
as
the
marcia
eyes
suffused
themselves
at
this
touch
of
which
coming
from
bartley
had
its
sadness
but
she
said
nothing
and
he
was
eager
to
escape
and
get
back
to
their
guest
he
told
her
he
should
go
out
with
kinney
and
that
she
was
not
to
sit
up
for
they
might
be
out
late
in
his
pride
he
took
kinney
down
to
the
events
office
and
unlocked
it
and
lit
the
gas
so
as
to
show
him
the
editorial
rooms
and
then
he
passed
him
into
one
of
the
theatres
where
they
saw
part
of
an
offenbach
opera
after
that
they
went
to
the
parker
house
and
had
a
new
york
stew
kinney
said
he
must
be
off
by
the
train
and
bartley
thought
it
well
to
concentrate
as
many
dazzling
effects
upon
him
as
he
could
in
the
single
evening
at
his
disposal
he
only
regretted
that
it
was
not
the
club
night
for
he
would
have
liked
to
take
kinney
round
and
show
him
some
of
the
fellows
but
never
mind
he
said
i
going
to
have
one
of
them
dine
with
us
and
you
see
about
the
best
of
the
well
sir
observed
kinney
when
they
had
got
back
into
bartley
parlor
and
he
was
again
drinking
in
its
prettiness
in
the
subdued
light
of
the
shaded
argand
burner
i
hai
seen
anything
yet
that
suits
me
much
better
than
it
is
bad
said
bartley
he
had
got
up
a
plate
of
crackers
and
two
bottles
of
tivoli
and
was
opening
the
first
he
offered
the
beaded
goblet
to
kinney
thank
you
said
kinney
not
any
i
never
bartley
quaffed
half
of
it
in
tolerant
content
i
do
find
it
takes
my
nerves
down
at
the
end
of
a
hard
week
work
well
now
tell
me
some
thing
about
yourself
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
illinois
well
sir
i
got
a
friend
out
there
that
got
a
coal
mine
and
he
thinks
he
can
work
me
in
somehow
i
guess
he
can
i
tried
pretty
much
everything
why
do
you
come
out
there
and
start
a
newspaper
we
got
a
town
that
bound
to
it
amused
bartley
to
hear
kinney
bragging
already
of
a
town
that
he
had
never
seen
he
winked
a
disdain
over
the
rim
of
the
goblet
which
he
tilted
on
his
lips
and
give
up
my
chances
here
he
said
as
he
set
the
goblet
down
well
that
so
said
kinney
responding
to
the
sense
of
the
wink
tell
you
what
bartley
i
did
know
as
you
speak
to
me
when
i
rung
your
bell
but
thinks
i
to
myself
it
look
here
he
ca
slam
the
door
in
your
face
anyway
and
you
hankered
after
him
so
long
go
and
take
your
chances
you
old
buzzard
and
so
i
got
your
address
at
the
events
office
pretty
early
this
morning
and
i
went
round
all
day
screwing
my
courage
up
as
old
macbeth
says
or
ritchloo
do
know
which
it
was
and
at
last
i
get
myself
so
that
i
toed
the
mark
like
a
little
bartley
laughed
so
that
he
could
hardly
get
the
cork
out
of
the
second
bottle
you
see
said
kinney
leaning
forward
and
taking
bartley
plump
soft
knee
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
i
felt
awfully
about
the
way
we
parted
that
night
i
felt
i
had
acted
well
just
to
my
own
mind
and
it
cut
me
to
have
you
refuse
my
money
it
cut
me
all
the
worse
because
i
saw
that
you
was
partly
right
i
been
quite
fair
with
you
but
i
always
did
admire
you
and
you
know
it
some
them
little
things
you
used
to
get
off
in
the
old
free
press
well
i
could
see
you
was
and
i
liked
you
and
it
kind
o
hurt
me
when
i
thought
you
been
makin
fun
me
to
that
woman
well
i
could
see
i
was
a
dumned
old
fool
afterwards
and
i
always
wanted
to
tell
you
so
and
i
always
did
hope
that
i
should
be
able
to
offer
you
that
money
again
twice
over
and
get
you
to
take
it
just
to
show
that
you
did
bear
bartley
looked
up
with
quickened
interest
but
i
ca
do
it
now
sir
added
kinney
why
what
happened
asked
bartley
in
a
disappointed
tone
pouring
out
his
second
glass
from
his
second
bottle
well
sir
said
kinney
with
a
certain
reluctance
i
undertook
to
provision
the
camp
on
spec
last
winter
and
well
you
know
i
always
run
a
little
on
food
for
the
brain
bartley
broke
into
a
reminiscent
cackle
and
kinney
smiled
forlornly
and
thinks
i
it
i
give
the
real
thing
every
time
and
i
got
hold
of
a
circular
and
i
sent
on
for
a
half
a
dozen
barrels
of
their
crackers
and
half
a
dozen
of
their
flour
and
a
lot
of
cracked
cocoa
and
i
put
the
camp
on
a
basis
i
calculated
to
bring
those
fellows
out
in
the
spring
physically
vigorous
and
mentally
enlightened
but
my
goodness
after
the
first
bakin
o
that
flour
and
the
first
round
o
them
crackers
it
was
all
up
fellows
got
so
mad
that
i
suppose
if
i
had
gone
back
to
doughnuts
and
sody
biscuits
and
japan
tea
they
burnt
the
camp
down
of
course
i
yielded
but
it
ruined
me
bartley
it
bartley
dropped
his
arms
upon
the
table
and
hiding
his
face
upon
them
laughed
and
laughed
again
well
sir
said
kinney
with
sad
satisfaction
i
glad
to
see
that
you
do
need
any
money
from
he
had
been
taking
another
survey
of
the
parlor
and
the
beyond
i
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
anybody
much
better
fixed
i
should
say
that
you
was
a
success
and
you
deserve
it
you
a
smart
fellow
bart
and
you
a
good
fellow
you
a
generous
kinney
voice
shook
with
emotion
bartley
having
lifted
his
wet
and
flushed
face
managed
to
say
oh
there
nothing
mean
about
kinney
as
he
felt
blindly
for
the
beer
bottles
which
he
shook
in
succession
with
an
evident
surprise
at
finding
them
empty
you
acted
like
a
brother
to
me
bartley
hubbard
continued
kinney
and
i
forget
it
in
a
hurry
i
guess
it
would
about
broke
my
heart
if
you
had
taken
it
just
the
way
you
did
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
that
did
use
you
well
or
the
woman
either
said
kinney
with
vague
defiance
though
do
seem
to
have
done
so
bad
by
you
he
added
in
recognition
of
marcia
merit
i
should
say
was
the
biggest
part
of
your
luck
she
a
lady
sir
every
inch
of
her
mighty
different
stripe
from
that
montreal
woman
that
cut
up
so
that
oh
macallister
was
such
a
scamp
after
all
said
bartley
with
magnanimity
well
sir
can
say
so
i
ai
going
to
be
too
strict
with
a
but
i
like
to
see
a
married
woman
like
a
married
woman
now
i
think
you
catch
hubbard
flirting
with
a
young
fellow
the
way
that
woman
went
on
with
you
that
night
bartley
grinned
well
sir
getting
along
and
you
perfect
clam
said
bartley
such
a
position
as
you
got
such
a
house
such
a
wife
such
a
baby
well
said
kinney
rising
it
a
little
too
much
for
want
to
go
to
bed
asked
bartley
yes
i
guess
i
better
turn
in
returned
kinney
despairingly
show
you
the
bartley
tripped
up
stairs
with
kinney
bag
which
they
had
left
standing
in
the
hall
while
kinney
creaked
carefully
after
him
and
so
led
the
way
to
the
and
turned
up
the
gaslight
which
had
been
left
burning
low
kinney
stood
erect
dwarfing
the
room
and
looked
round
on
the
pink
chintzing
and
soft
carpet
and
white
coverleted
bed
and
with
meek
veneration
well
i
swear
he
said
no
more
but
sat
hopelessly
down
and
began
to
pull
off
his
boots
he
was
in
the
same
humble
mood
the
next
morning
when
having
got
up
inordinately
early
he
was
found
trying
to
fix
his
mind
on
a
newspaper
by
bartley
who
came
down
late
to
the
sunday
breakfast
and
led
his
guest
into
the
marcia
in
a
bewitching
was
already
there
having
put
the
daintier
touches
to
the
meal
herself
and
the
baby
in
a
fresh
white
dress
was
there
tied
into
its
with
a
napkin
and
beating
on
the
table
with
a
spoon
bartley
nonchalance
amidst
all
this
impressed
kinney
with
a
yet
more
poignant
sense
of
his
superiority
and
almost
deprived
him
of
the
powers
of
speech
when
after
breakfast
bartley
took
him
out
to
cambridge
on
the
and
showed
him
the
college
buildings
and
memorial
hall
and
the
washington
elm
and
mount
auburn
kinney
fell
into
such
a
cowed
and
broken
condition
that
something
had
to
be
specially
done
to
put
him
in
repair
against
ricker
coming
to
dinner
marcia
luckily
thought
of
asking
him
if
he
would
like
to
see
her
kitchen
in
this
region
kinney
found
himself
at
home
and
praised
its
neat
perfection
with
professional
intelligence
bartley
followed
them
round
with
flavia
on
his
arm
and
put
in
a
jocose
word
here
and
there
when
he
saw
kinney
about
to
fall
a
prey
to
his
respect
for
marcia
and
so
kept
him
going
till
ricker
rang
he
contrived
to
give
ricker
a
hint
of
the
sort
of
man
he
had
on
his
hands
and
by
their
joint
effort
they
had
kinney
talking
about
himself
at
dinner
before
he
knew
what
he
was
about
he
could
not
help
talking
well
upon
this
theme
and
he
had
them
so
vividly
interested
as
he
poured
out
adventure
after
adventure
in
his
strange
career
that
bartley
began
to
be
proud
of
him
well
sir
said
ricker
when
he
came
to
a
pause
you
lived
a
yes
replied
kinney
looking
at
bartley
for
his
approval
and
always
thought
that
if
i
ever
got
run
clean
ashore
high
and
dry
make
a
stagger
to
write
it
out
and
do
something
with
it
do
you
suppose
i
could
i
promise
to
take
it
for
the
sunday
edition
of
the
chronicle
abstract
whenever
you
get
it
ready
said
ricker
bartley
laid
his
hand
on
his
friend
arm
it
bought
up
old
fellow
that
narrative
of
an
average
american
belongs
to
the
they
had
their
laugh
at
this
and
then
ricker
said
to
kinney
but
look
here
my
friend
what
to
prevent
our
interviewing
you
on
this
little
personal
history
of
yours
and
using
your
material
any
way
we
like
it
seems
to
me
that
you
put
your
head
in
the
lion
oh
i
amongst
gentlemen
said
kinney
with
an
innocent
swagger
i
understand
well
i
do
know
about
it
said
ricker
hubbard
here
is
used
to
all
sorts
of
hard
names
but
i
never
had
that
epithet
applied
to
me
kinney
doubled
himself
up
over
the
side
of
his
chair
in
recognition
of
ricker
joke
and
when
bartley
rose
and
asked
him
if
he
would
come
into
the
parlor
and
have
a
cigar
he
said
with
a
wink
no
he
guessed
he
would
stay
with
the
ladies
he
waited
with
great
mystery
till
the
were
closed
and
bartley
had
stopped
peeping
through
the
crevice
between
them
and
then
he
began
to
disengage
from
his
the
golden
nugget
shaped
to
a
rude
sphere
which
hung
there
this
done
he
asked
if
he
might
put
it
on
the
little
necklace
a
christening
gift
from
halleck
which
the
baby
had
on
to
see
how
it
looked
it
looked
very
well
like
an
old
roman
though
neither
kinney
nor
marcia
knew
it
guess
we
let
it
stay
there
he
suggested
timidly
mr
kinney
cried
marcia
in
amaze
i
ca
let
you
oh
now
pleaded
the
big
fellow
simply
if
you
knew
how
much
good
it
does
me
you
would
why
it
been
like
heaven
to
me
to
get
into
such
a
home
as
this
for
a
day
it
has
like
heaven
said
marcia
turning
pale
oh
my
well
i
do
mean
any
harm
what
i
mean
is
i
knocked
about
the
world
so
much
and
never
had
any
home
of
my
own
that
to
see
folks
as
happy
as
you
be
makes
me
happier
than
i
been
since
i
do
know
when
now
you
let
it
stay
it
was
the
first
piece
of
gold
i
picked
up
in
californy
when
i
went
out
there
in
and
it
about
the
last
i
did
have
very
good
luck
well
of
course
i
know
i
ai
fit
to
give
it
but
i
want
to
do
it
i
think
bartley
about
the
greatest
fellow
and
he
the
best
fellow
this
world
can
show
that
the
way
i
feel
about
him
and
i
want
to
do
it
sho
the
thing
no
use
to
me
marcia
always
gave
her
maid
off
all
work
sunday
afternoon
and
she
would
not
trespass
upon
her
rule
because
she
had
guests
that
day
except
for
the
confusion
to
which
kinney
unexpected
gift
had
put
her
she
would
have
waited
for
him
to
join
the
others
before
she
began
to
clear
away
the
dinner
but
now
she
mechanically
began
and
kinney
to
whom
these
domestic
occupations
were
a
second
nature
joined
her
in
the
work
equally
in
the
fervor
of
his
petition
bartley
suddenly
flung
open
the
doors
my
dear
ricker
says
he
must
be
go
he
discovered
marcia
with
the
dish
of
potatoes
in
her
hand
and
kinney
in
the
act
of
carrying
off
the
platter
of
turkey
look
here
ricker
kinney
came
to
himself
and
opening
his
mouth
above
the
platter
wide
enough
to
swallow
the
remains
of
the
turkey
slapped
his
leg
with
the
hand
that
he
released
for
the
purpose
and
shouted
the
ruling
passion
bartley
the
ruling
passion
the
men
roared
but
marcia
even
while
she
took
in
the
situation
did
not
see
anything
so
ridiculous
in
it
as
they
she
smiled
a
little
in
sympathy
with
their
mirth
and
then
said
with
a
look
and
tone
which
he
had
not
seen
or
heard
in
her
since
the
day
of
their
picnic
at
equity
come
see
what
kinney
has
given
baby
they
sat
up
talking
kinney
over
after
he
was
gone
but
even
at
ten
bartley
said
he
should
not
go
to
bed
he
felt
like
writing
xxix
bartley
lived
well
now
he
felt
that
he
could
afford
it
on
fifty
dollars
a
week
and
yet
somehow
he
had
always
a
sheaf
of
unpaid
bills
on
hand
rent
was
so
much
the
butcher
so
much
the
grocer
so
much
these
were
the
great
outlays
and
he
knew
just
what
they
were
but
the
sum
total
was
always
much
larger
than
he
expected
at
a
pinch
he
borrowed
but
he
did
not
let
marcia
know
of
this
for
she
would
have
starved
herself
to
pay
the
debt
what
was
worse
she
would
have
wished
him
to
starve
with
her
he
kept
the
purse
and
he
kept
the
accounts
he
was
master
in
his
house
and
he
meant
to
be
so
the
pinch
always
seemed
to
come
in
the
matter
of
clothes
and
then
marcia
gave
up
whatever
she
wanted
and
said
she
must
make
the
old
things
do
bartley
hated
this
in
his
position
he
must
dress
well
and
as
there
was
nothing
mean
about
him
he
wished
marcia
to
dress
well
to
just
at
this
time
he
had
set
his
heart
on
her
having
a
certain
sacque
which
they
had
noticed
in
a
certain
window
one
day
when
they
were
on
washington
street
together
he
surprised
her
a
week
later
by
bringing
the
sacque
home
to
her
and
he
surprised
himself
with
a
cap
which
he
had
long
coveted
it
was
coming
winter
now
and
for
half
a
dozen
days
of
the
season
he
would
really
need
the
cap
there
would
be
many
days
when
it
would
be
comfortable
and
many
others
when
it
would
be
tolerable
and
he
looked
so
handsome
in
it
that
marcia
herself
could
not
quite
feel
that
it
was
an
extravagance
she
asked
him
how
they
could
afford
both
of
the
things
at
once
but
he
answered
with
easy
mystery
that
he
had
provided
the
funds
and
she
went
gayly
round
with
him
to
call
on
the
hallecks
that
evening
and
show
off
her
sacque
it
was
so
stylish
and
pretty
that
it
won
her
a
compliment
from
ben
halleck
which
she
noticed
because
it
was
the
first
compliment
or
anything
like
it
that
he
had
ever
paid
her
she
repeated
it
to
bartley
he
said
that
i
looked
like
a
hungarian
princess
that
he
saw
in
well
i
suppose
it
has
a
hussar
kind
of
look
with
that
fur
trimming
and
that
broad
braid
did
anybody
say
anything
about
my
cap
asked
bartley
with
burlesque
eagerness
oh
poor
bartley
she
cried
in
laughing
triumph
i
do
believe
any
of
them
noticed
it
and
you
kept
twirling
it
round
in
your
hands
all
the
time
to
make
them
yes
i
did
my
level
best
said
bartley
they
had
a
jolly
time
about
that
marcia
was
proud
of
her
sacque
when
she
took
it
off
and
held
it
up
by
the
loop
in
the
neck
so
as
to
realize
its
prettiness
she
said
she
should
make
it
last
three
winters
at
least
and
she
leaned
over
and
gave
bartley
a
sweet
kiss
of
gratitude
and
affection
and
told
him
not
to
try
to
make
up
for
it
by
extra
work
but
to
help
her
scrimp
for
it
i
rather
do
the
extra
work
he
protested
in
fact
he
already
had
the
extra
work
done
it
was
something
that
he
felt
he
had
the
right
to
sell
outside
of
the
events
and
he
carried
his
manuscript
to
ricker
and
offered
it
to
him
for
his
sunday
edition
ricker
read
the
title
and
ran
his
eye
down
the
first
slip
and
then
glanced
quickly
at
hubbard
you
do
mean
it
yes
i
do
said
bartley
why
not
i
thought
he
was
going
to
use
the
material
himself
some
bartley
laughed
he
use
the
material
why
he
ca
write
any
more
than
a
hen
he
can
make
tracks
on
paper
but
nobody
would
print
much
less
buy
i
know
him
he
all
right
it
would
hurt
the
material
for
his
purpose
any
way
and
he
be
tickled
to
death
when
he
sees
it
if
he
ever
does
look
here
ricker
added
bartley
with
a
touch
of
anger
at
the
hesitation
in
his
friend
face
if
you
going
to
spring
any
conscientious
scruples
on
me
i
prefer
to
offer
my
manuscript
elsewhere
i
give
you
the
first
chance
at
it
but
it
need
go
begging
do
you
suppose
i
do
this
if
i
did
understand
the
man
and
know
just
how
he
take
it
why
of
course
hubbard
i
beg
your
pardon
if
you
say
it
all
right
i
am
bound
to
be
satisfied
what
do
you
want
for
it
fifty
that
a
good
deal
is
it
yes
it
is
but
i
ca
afford
to
do
a
dishonorable
thing
for
less
money
said
bartley
with
a
wink
the
next
sunday
when
marcia
came
home
from
church
she
went
into
the
parlor
a
moment
to
speak
to
bartley
before
she
ran
upstairs
to
the
baby
he
was
writing
and
she
put
her
left
hand
on
his
back
while
with
her
right
she
held
her
sacque
slung
over
her
shoulder
by
the
loop
and
leaned
forward
with
a
wandering
eye
on
the
papers
that
strewed
the
table
in
that
attitude
he
felt
her
pause
and
grow
absorbed
and
then
rigid
her
light
caress
tightened
into
a
grip
why
how
base
how
shameful
that
man
shall
never
enter
my
doors
again
why
it
stealing
what
the
matter
what
are
you
talking
about
bartley
looked
up
with
a
frown
of
preparation
this
cried
marcia
snatching
up
the
at
which
she
had
been
looking
have
you
seen
it
here
kinney
life
all
written
out
and
when
he
said
that
he
was
going
to
keep
it
and
write
it
out
himself
that
thief
has
stolen
it
look
out
how
you
talk
said
bartley
kinney
an
old
fool
and
he
never
could
have
written
it
out
in
the
world
that
makes
no
difference
he
said
that
he
told
the
things
because
he
knew
he
was
among
gentlemen
a
great
gentleman
ricker
is
and
i
thought
he
was
so
nice
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
which
flashed
again
i
want
you
to
break
off
with
him
bartley
i
do
want
you
to
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
and
i
shall
be
proud
to
tell
everybody
that
broken
off
with
him
he
was
a
thief
oh
bartley
hold
your
tongue
shouted
her
husband
i
hold
my
tongue
and
if
you
defend
do
you
say
a
word
against
ricker
it
all
right
i
tell
you
you
understand
such
things
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
i
i
i
wrote
the
thing
he
could
face
her
but
she
could
not
face
him
there
was
a
subsidence
in
her
proud
attitude
as
if
her
physical
strength
had
snapped
with
her
breaking
spirit
there
no
theft
about
bartley
went
on
kinney
would
never
write
it
out
and
if
he
did
i
put
the
material
in
better
shape
for
him
here
than
he
could
ever
have
given
it
six
weeks
from
now
nobody
will
remember
a
word
of
it
and
he
could
tell
the
same
things
right
over
again
and
they
would
be
just
as
good
as
he
went
on
to
argue
the
point
she
seemed
not
to
have
listened
to
him
when
he
stopped
she
said
in
a
quiet
passionless
voice
i
suppose
you
wrote
it
to
get
money
for
this
yes
i
did
replied
bartley
she
dropped
it
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
i
shall
never
wear
it
again
she
said
in
the
same
tone
and
a
little
sigh
escaped
her
use
your
pleasure
about
that
said
bartley
sitting
down
to
his
writing
again
as
she
turned
and
left
the
room
she
went
upstairs
and
came
down
immediately
with
the
gold
nugget
which
she
had
wrenched
from
the
baby
necklace
and
laid
it
on
the
paper
before
him
perhaps
you
would
like
to
spend
it
for
tivoli
beer
she
suggested
flavia
shall
not
wear
i
get
it
fitted
on
to
my
bartley
slipped
it
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
the
sacque
still
lay
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
he
pulled
his
chair
a
little
forward
and
put
his
feet
on
it
he
feigned
to
write
awhile
longer
and
then
he
folded
up
his
papers
and
went
out
leaving
marcia
to
make
her
sunday
dinner
alone
when
he
came
home
late
at
night
he
found
the
sacque
where
she
had
dropped
it
and
with
a
curse
he
picked
it
up
and
hung
it
on
the
in
the
hall
he
slept
in
the
and
at
times
during
the
night
the
child
cried
in
marcia
room
and
waked
him
and
then
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
of
sobbing
which
was
not
the
child
in
the
morning
when
he
came
down
to
breakfast
marcia
met
him
with
swollen
eyes
bartley
she
said
tremulously
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
how
you
felt
justified
in
writing
out
kinney
life
in
that
my
dear
said
bartley
with
perfect
amiability
for
he
had
slept
off
his
anger
and
he
really
felt
sorry
to
see
her
so
unhappy
i
would
tell
you
almost
anything
you
want
on
any
other
subject
but
i
think
we
had
better
remand
that
one
to
the
safety
of
silence
and
go
upon
the
general
supposition
that
i
know
what
i
i
ca
bartley
ca
you
well
that
a
he
pulled
his
chair
to
the
it
seems
to
me
that
girl
imagination
always
fails
her
on
mondays
can
she
never
give
us
anything
but
hash
and
when
she
going
to
wash
however
the
coffee
good
i
suppose
made
it
bartley
persisted
marcia
i
want
to
believe
in
everything
you
do
i
want
to
be
proud
of
it
that
will
be
difficult
suggested
bartley
with
an
air
of
thoughtful
impartiality
for
the
wife
of
a
newspaper
no
no
it
need
be
it
must
be
if
you
will
only
tell
me
she
stopped
as
if
she
feared
to
repeat
her
offence
bartley
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
intense
face
with
a
smile
tell
you
that
in
some
way
i
had
kinney
authority
to
use
his
facts
well
i
should
have
done
that
yesterday
if
you
had
let
me
in
the
first
place
kinney
the
most
helpless
ass
in
the
world
he
could
never
have
used
his
own
facts
in
the
second
place
there
was
hardly
anything
in
his
rigmarole
the
other
day
that
he
had
told
me
down
there
in
the
lumber
camp
with
full
authority
to
use
it
in
any
way
i
liked
and
i
do
see
how
he
could
revoke
that
authority
that
the
way
i
reasoned
about
i
see
i
see
said
marcia
with
humble
eagerness
well
that
all
there
is
about
it
what
i
done
ca
hurt
kinney
if
he
ever
does
want
to
write
his
old
facts
out
he
be
glad
to
take
my
report
of
them
and
spoil
it
said
bartley
ending
with
a
laugh
and
if
if
there
had
been
anything
wrong
about
it
said
marcia
anxious
to
justify
him
to
herself
mr
ricker
would
have
told
you
so
when
you
offered
him
the
i
do
think
ricker
would
have
ventured
on
any
impertinence
with
me
said
bartley
with
grandeur
but
he
lapsed
into
his
wonted
easy
way
of
taking
everything
what
are
you
driving
at
marsh
i
do
care
particularly
for
what
happened
yesterday
we
had
rows
enough
before
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
have
them
again
you
gave
me
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
and
you
gave
yourself
he
looked
at
her
eyes
a
bad
night
apparently
that
all
there
is
about
oh
no
that
is
all
it
is
like
the
other
quarrels
we
had
when
i
think
how
i
felt
toward
you
ever
since
it
me
there
ca
be
anything
sacred
in
our
marriage
unless
we
trust
each
other
in
well
have
done
any
of
the
mistrusting
said
bartley
with
humorous
lightness
but
is
sacred
rather
a
strong
word
to
use
in
regard
to
our
marriage
anyway
why
why
what
do
you
mean
bartley
we
were
married
by
a
well
yes
by
what
was
left
of
one
said
bartley
he
could
seem
to
shake
himself
together
sufficiently
to
ask
for
the
proof
that
we
had
declared
our
intention
to
get
marcia
looked
mystified
do
you
remember
his
saying
there
was
something
else
and
my
suggesting
to
him
that
it
was
the
fee
marcia
turned
white
father
said
the
certificate
was
all
right
oh
he
asked
to
see
it
did
he
he
is
a
prudent
old
gentleman
well
it
is
all
and
what
difference
did
it
make
about
our
not
proving
that
we
had
declared
our
intention
asked
marcia
as
if
only
partly
reassured
no
difference
to
us
and
only
a
difference
of
sixty
dollars
fine
to
him
if
it
was
ever
found
and
you
let
the
poor
old
man
run
that
risk
well
you
see
it
could
be
helped
we
had
declared
our
intention
and
the
lady
seemed
very
anxious
to
be
married
you
need
be
troubled
we
are
married
right
and
tight
enough
but
i
do
know
that
there
anything
about
no
marcia
wailed
out
its
tainted
with
fraud
from
the
if
you
like
to
say
so
bartley
assented
putting
his
napkin
into
its
ring
marcia
hid
her
face
in
her
arms
on
the
table
the
baby
left
off
drumming
with
its
spoon
and
began
to
cry
witherby
was
reading
the
sunday
edition
of
the
when
bartley
got
down
to
the
events
office
and
he
cleared
his
throat
with
a
premonitory
cough
as
his
assistant
swung
easily
into
the
room
good
morning
hubbard
he
said
there
is
quite
an
interesting
article
in
yesterday
have
you
seen
it
yes
said
bartley
what
article
this
confessions
of
an
average
witherby
held
out
the
paper
where
bartley
article
vividly
and
filled
half
a
page
what
is
the
reason
can
not
have
something
of
this
kind
well
i
do
know
bartley
began
have
you
any
idea
who
wrote
this
oh
yes
i
wrote
witherby
had
the
task
before
him
of
transmuting
an
expression
of
rather
low
cunning
into
one
of
wounded
confidence
mingled
with
surprise
i
thought
it
had
your
hubbard
but
i
preferred
not
to
believe
it
till
i
heard
the
fact
from
your
own
lips
i
supposed
that
our
contract
covered
such
contributions
as
i
wrote
it
out
of
time
and
on
sunday
night
you
pay
me
by
the
week
and
all
that
i
do
throughout
the
week
belongs
to
you
the
next
day
after
that
sunday
i
did
a
full
day
work
on
the
events
i
do
see
what
you
have
to
complain
of
you
told
me
when
i
began
that
you
would
not
expect
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
work
from
me
have
i
ever
done
less
no
but
have
i
always
done
more
yes
i
have
never
complained
of
the
amount
of
work
but
upon
this
theory
of
yours
what
you
did
in
your
summer
vacation
would
not
belong
to
the
events
or
what
you
did
on
legal
i
never
have
any
summer
vacation
or
holidays
legal
or
illegal
even
when
i
was
down
at
equity
last
summer
i
sent
you
something
for
the
paper
every
this
was
true
and
witherby
could
not
gainsay
it
very
well
sir
if
this
is
to
be
your
interpretation
of
our
understanding
for
the
future
i
shall
wish
to
revise
our
contract
he
said
pompously
you
can
tear
it
up
if
you
like
returned
bartley
i
dare
say
ricker
would
jump
at
a
little
study
of
the
true
inwardness
of
journalism
unless
you
insist
upon
having
it
for
the
bartley
gave
a
chuckle
of
enjoyment
as
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
witherby
rose
and
stalked
away
he
returned
in
half
an
hour
and
said
with
an
air
of
frank
concession
touched
with
personal
grief
mr
hubbard
i
can
see
how
from
your
point
of
view
you
were
perfectly
justifiable
in
selling
your
article
to
the
my
point
of
view
is
different
but
i
shall
not
insist
upon
it
and
i
wish
to
withdraw
and
and
apologize
for
any
hasty
expressions
i
may
have
all
right
said
bartley
with
a
wicked
grin
he
had
triumphed
but
his
triumph
was
one
to
leave
some
men
with
an
uneasy
feeling
and
there
was
not
altogether
a
pleasant
taste
in
bartley
mouth
after
that
his
position
in
the
events
office
was
whatever
he
chose
to
make
it
but
he
did
not
abuse
his
ascendency
and
he
even
made
a
point
of
increased
deference
towards
witherby
many
courtesies
passed
between
them
each
took
some
trouble
to
show
the
other
that
he
had
no
ill
feeling
three
or
four
weeks
later
bartley
received
a
letter
with
an
illinois
postmark
which
gave
him
a
disagreeable
sensation
at
first
for
he
knew
it
must
be
from
kinney
but
the
letter
was
so
amusingly
characteristic
so
helplessly
and
that
he
could
not
help
laughing
kinney
gave
an
account
of
his
travels
to
the
mining
town
and
of
his
present
situation
and
future
prospects
he
was
full
of
affectionate
messages
and
inquiries
for
bartley
family
and
he
said
he
should
never
forget
that
sunday
he
had
passed
with
them
in
a
postscript
he
added
they
copied
that
string
of
lies
into
our
paper
here
out
of
the
it
was
pretty
well
done
but
if
your
friend
ricker
done
it
not
goen
to
insult
him
soon
again
by
calling
him
a
this
laconic
reference
to
the
matter
in
a
postscript
was
delicious
to
bartley
he
seemed
to
hear
kinney
saying
the
words
and
imagined
his
air
of
ineffective
sarcasm
he
carried
the
letter
about
with
him
and
the
first
time
he
saw
ricker
he
showed
it
to
him
ricker
read
it
without
appearing
greatly
diverted
when
he
came
to
the
postscript
he
flushed
and
demanded
what
have
you
done
about
it
oh
i
have
done
anything
it
was
necessary
you
see
now
what
kinney
could
have
done
with
his
facts
if
we
had
left
them
to
him
it
would
have
been
a
wicked
waste
of
material
i
thought
the
sight
of
some
of
his
literature
would
help
you
wash
up
your
uncleanly
scruples
on
that
how
long
have
you
had
this
letter
pursued
ricker
do
know
a
week
or
ten
ricker
folded
it
up
and
returned
it
to
him
mr
hubbard
he
said
the
next
time
we
meet
will
you
do
me
the
favor
to
cut
my
acquaintance
bartley
stared
at
him
he
thought
he
must
be
joking
why
ricker
the
matter
i
did
suppose
you
care
anything
about
old
kinney
i
thought
it
would
amuse
you
why
confound
it
i
just
as
soon
write
out
and
tell
him
that
i
did
the
he
began
to
be
angry
but
i
can
cut
your
acquaintance
fast
enough
or
any
man
if
you
really
on
your
ear
i
on
my
ear
said
ricker
he
left
bartley
standing
where
they
had
met
it
was
peculiarly
unfortunate
for
bartley
had
occasion
within
that
week
to
ask
ricker
advice
and
he
was
debarred
from
doing
so
by
this
absurd
displeasure
since
their
recent
perfect
understanding
witherby
had
slighted
no
opportunity
to
cement
their
friendship
and
to
attach
bartley
more
and
more
firmly
to
the
events
he
now
offered
him
some
of
the
events
stock
on
extremely
advantageous
terms
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
attaching
him
to
the
paper
there
seemed
nothing
covert
in
this
and
bartley
had
never
heard
any
doubts
of
the
prosperity
of
the
events
but
he
would
have
especially
liked
to
have
ricker
mind
upon
this
offer
of
stock
witherby
had
urged
him
not
to
pay
for
the
whole
outright
but
to
accept
a
somewhat
lower
salary
and
trust
to
his
dividends
to
make
up
the
difference
the
shares
had
paid
fifteen
per
cent
the
year
before
and
bartley
could
judge
for
himself
of
the
present
chances
from
that
showing
witherby
advised
him
to
borrow
only
fifteen
hundred
dollars
on
the
three
thousand
of
stock
which
he
offered
him
and
to
pay
up
the
balance
in
three
years
by
dropping
five
hundred
a
year
from
his
salary
it
was
certainly
a
flattering
proposal
and
under
his
breath
where
bartley
still
did
most
of
his
blaspheming
he
cursed
ricker
for
an
old
fool
and
resolved
to
close
with
witherby
on
his
own
responsibility
after
he
had
done
so
he
told
marcia
of
the
step
he
had
taken
since
their
last
quarrel
there
had
been
an
alienation
in
her
behavior
toward
him
different
from
any
former
resentment
she
was
submissive
and
quiescent
she
looked
carefully
after
his
comfort
and
was
perfect
in
her
housekeeping
but
she
held
aloof
from
him
somehow
and
left
him
to
a
solitude
in
her
presence
in
which
he
fancied
if
he
did
not
divine
her
contempt
but
in
this
matter
of
common
interest
something
of
their
community
of
feeling
revived
they
met
on
a
lower
level
but
they
met
for
the
moment
and
marcia
joined
eagerly
in
the
discussion
of
ways
and
means
the
notion
of
dropping
five
hundred
from
his
salary
delighted
her
because
they
must
now
cut
down
their
expenses
as
much
and
she
had
long
grieved
over
their
expenses
without
being
able
to
make
bartley
agree
to
their
reduction
she
went
upstairs
at
once
and
gave
the
little
a
week
warning
she
told
the
maid
of
all
work
that
she
must
take
three
dollars
a
week
hereafter
instead
of
four
or
else
find
another
place
she
mentally
forewent
new
spring
dresses
for
herself
and
the
baby
and
arranged
to
do
herself
all
of
the
wash
she
had
been
putting
out
she
put
a
note
in
the
mouth
of
the
can
at
the
back
door
telling
the
milkman
to
leave
only
two
quarts
in
future
and
she
came
radiantly
back
to
tell
bartley
that
she
had
saved
half
of
the
lost
five
hundred
a
year
already
but
her
countenance
fell
why
where
are
you
to
get
the
other
fifteen
hundred
dollars
bartley
oh
i
ve
thought
of
that
said
bartley
laughing
at
her
swift
alternations
of
triumph
and
despair
you
trust
to
me
for
you
not
not
going
to
ask
father
for
it
she
faltered
not
very
much
said
bartley
as
he
took
his
hat
to
go
out
he
meant
to
make
a
raise
out
of
ben
halleck
as
he
phrased
it
to
himself
he
knew
that
halleck
had
plenty
of
money
he
could
make
the
stock
itself
over
to
him
as
security
he
did
not
see
why
halleck
should
hesitate
but
when
he
entered
halleck
room
having
asked
cyrus
to
show
him
directly
there
halleck
gave
a
start
which
seemed
ominous
to
bartley
he
had
scarcely
the
heart
to
open
his
business
and
halleck
listened
with
changing
color
and
something
only
too
like
the
embarrassment
of
a
man
who
intends
a
refusal
he
would
not
look
bartley
in
the
face
and
when
bartley
had
made
an
end
he
sat
for
a
time
without
speaking
at
last
he
said
with
a
quick
sigh
as
if
at
the
close
of
an
internal
conflict
i
will
lend
you
the
money
bartley
heart
gave
a
bound
and
he
broke
out
into
an
immense
laugh
of
relief
and
clapped
halleck
on
the
shoulder
you
looked
deucedly
as
you
old
man
by
george
you
had
on
such
a
dismal
expression
that
i
did
know
but
come
to
borrow
money
of
and
i
made
up
my
mind
not
to
let
you
have
it
but
i
everlastingly
obliged
to
you
halleck
and
i
promise
you
that
you
wo
regret
i
shall
have
to
speak
to
my
father
about
this
said
halleck
responding
coldly
to
bartley
robust
pressure
of
his
hand
of
course
of
how
soon
shall
you
want
the
money
well
the
sooner
the
better
now
bring
the
check
round
you
night
and
take
dinner
with
us
you
and
olive
and
celebrate
a
little
i
know
it
will
please
marcia
when
she
finds
out
who
my
creditor
is
well
assented
halleck
with
a
smile
so
ghastly
that
bartley
noticed
it
even
in
his
joy
curse
me
he
said
to
himself
if
ever
i
saw
a
man
so
ashamed
of
doing
a
good
action
xxx
the
presidential
canvas
of
the
summer
which
followed
upon
these
events
in
bartley
career
was
not
very
active
sometimes
in
fact
it
languished
so
much
that
people
almost
forgot
it
and
a
good
field
was
afforded
the
events
for
the
practice
of
independent
journalism
to
hold
a
course
of
strict
impartiality
and
yet
come
out
on
the
winning
side
was
a
theory
of
independent
journalism
which
bartley
illustrated
with
cynical
enjoyment
he
developed
into
something
rather
artistic
the
gift
which
he
had
always
shown
in
his
newspaper
work
for
ironical
persiflage
witherby
was
not
a
man
to
feel
this
burlesque
himself
but
when
it
was
pointed
out
to
him
by
others
he
came
to
bartley
in
some
alarm
from
its
effect
upon
the
fortunes
of
the
paper
we
ca
afford
hubbard
he
said
with
virtuous
trepidation
we
ca
to
make
fun
of
our
friends
bartley
laughed
at
witherby
anxiety
they
no
more
our
friends
than
the
other
fellows
are
we
are
independent
journalists
and
this
way
of
treating
the
thing
leaves
us
perfectly
free
hereafter
to
claim
just
as
we
choose
that
we
were
in
fun
or
in
earnest
on
any
particular
question
if
we
ever
attacked
see
i
see
said
witherby
with
not
wholly
subdued
misgiving
but
after
due
time
for
conviction
no
man
enjoyed
bartley
irony
more
than
witherby
when
once
he
had
mastered
an
instance
of
it
sometimes
it
happened
that
bartley
found
him
chuckling
over
a
perfectly
serious
paragraph
but
he
did
not
mind
that
he
enjoyed
witherby
mistake
even
more
than
his
appreciation
in
these
days
bartley
was
in
almost
uninterrupted
good
humor
as
he
had
always
expected
to
be
when
he
became
fairly
prosperous
he
was
at
no
time
an
unamiable
fellow
as
he
saw
it
he
had
his
sulks
he
had
his
moments
of
anger
but
generally
he
felt
good
and
he
had
always
believed
and
he
had
promised
marcia
that
when
he
got
squarely
on
his
legs
he
should
feel
good
perpetually
this
sensation
he
now
agreeably
realized
and
he
was
also
now
in
that
position
in
which
he
had
proposed
to
himself
some
little
moral
reforms
he
was
not
much
in
the
habit
of
taking
stock
but
no
man
wholly
escapes
the
contingencies
in
which
he
is
confronted
with
himself
and
sees
certain
habits
traits
tendencies
which
he
would
like
to
change
for
the
sake
of
his
peace
of
mind
hereafter
to
some
souls
these
contingencies
are
full
of
anguish
of
remorse
for
the
past
of
despair
but
bartley
had
never
yet
seen
the
time
when
he
did
not
feel
himself
perfectly
able
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
and
blot
the
old
one
there
were
not
many
things
in
his
life
which
he
really
cared
to
have
very
different
but
there
were
two
or
three
shady
little
corners
which
he
always
intended
to
clean
up
he
had
meant
some
time
or
other
to
have
a
religious
belief
of
some
sort
he
did
not
much
care
what
since
marcia
had
taken
to
the
hallecks
church
he
did
not
see
why
he
should
not
go
with
her
though
he
had
never
yet
done
so
he
was
not
quite
sure
whether
he
was
always
as
candid
with
her
as
he
might
be
or
as
kind
though
he
maintained
against
this
question
that
in
all
their
quarrels
it
was
six
of
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
the
other
he
had
never
been
tipsy
but
once
in
his
life
and
he
considered
that
he
had
repented
and
atoned
for
that
enough
especially
as
nothing
had
ever
come
of
it
but
sometimes
he
thought
he
might
be
the
beer
yes
he
thought
he
must
cut
down
on
the
tivoli
he
was
getting
ridiculously
fat
if
ever
he
met
kinney
again
he
should
tell
him
that
it
was
he
and
not
ricker
who
had
appropriated
his
facts
and
he
intended
to
make
it
up
with
ricker
somehow
he
had
not
found
just
the
opportunity
yet
but
in
the
mean
time
he
did
not
mind
telling
the
real
cause
of
their
alienation
to
good
fellows
who
could
enjoy
a
joke
he
had
his
following
though
so
many
of
his
brother
journalists
had
cooled
toward
him
and
those
of
his
following
considered
him
as
smart
as
and
bound
to
rise
these
young
men
and
not
very
wise
elders
roared
over
bartley
frank
declaration
of
the
situation
between
himself
and
ricker
and
they
contended
that
if
ricker
had
taken
the
article
for
the
he
ought
to
take
the
consequences
bartley
told
them
that
of
course
he
should
explain
the
facts
to
kinney
but
that
he
meant
to
let
ricker
enjoy
his
virtuous
indignation
awhile
once
after
a
confidence
of
this
kind
at
the
club
where
ricker
had
refused
to
speak
to
him
he
came
away
with
a
curious
sense
of
moral
decay
it
did
not
pain
him
a
great
deal
but
it
certainly
surprised
him
that
now
with
all
these
prosperous
conditions
so
favorable
for
cleaning
up
he
had
so
little
disposition
to
clean
up
he
found
himself
quite
willing
to
let
the
affair
with
ricker
go
and
he
suspected
that
he
had
been
needlessly
virtuous
in
his
intentions
concerning
and
beer
as
to
marcia
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
could
not
treat
a
woman
of
her
disposition
otherwise
than
as
he
did
at
any
rate
if
he
had
not
done
everything
he
could
to
make
her
happy
she
seemed
to
be
getting
along
well
enough
and
was
probably
quite
as
happy
as
she
deserved
to
be
they
were
getting
on
very
quietly
now
there
had
been
no
violent
outbreak
between
them
since
the
trouble
about
kinney
and
then
she
had
practically
confessed
herself
in
the
wrong
as
bartley
looked
at
it
she
had
appeared
contented
with
his
explanation
there
was
what
might
be
called
a
perfect
business
amity
between
them
if
her
life
with
him
was
no
longer
an
expression
of
that
intense
devotion
which
she
used
to
show
him
it
was
more
like
what
married
life
generally
comes
to
and
he
accepted
her
tractability
and
what
seemed
her
view
of
their
relations
as
greatly
preferable
with
his
growth
in
flesh
bartley
liked
peace
more
and
more
marcia
had
consented
to
go
down
to
equity
alone
that
summer
for
he
had
convinced
her
that
during
a
heated
political
contest
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
be
away
from
the
paper
he
promised
to
go
down
for
her
when
she
wished
to
come
home
and
it
was
easily
arranged
for
her
to
travel
as
far
as
the
junction
under
halleck
escort
when
he
went
to
join
his
sisters
in
the
white
mountains
bartley
missed
her
and
the
baby
at
first
but
he
soon
began
to
adjust
himself
with
resignation
to
his
solitude
they
had
determined
to
keep
their
maid
over
this
summer
for
they
had
so
much
trouble
in
replacing
her
the
last
time
after
their
return
and
bartley
said
he
should
live
very
economically
it
was
quiet
and
the
woman
kept
the
house
cool
and
clean
she
was
a
good
cook
and
when
bartley
brought
a
man
home
to
dinner
she
took
an
interest
in
serving
it
well
bartley
let
her
order
the
things
from
the
grocer
and
butcher
for
she
knew
what
they
were
used
to
getting
and
he
had
heard
so
much
talk
from
marcia
about
bills
since
he
bought
that
events
stock
that
he
was
sick
of
the
prices
of
things
there
was
no
extravagance
and
vet
he
seemed
to
live
very
much
better
after
marcia
went
there
is
no
doubt
but
he
lived
very
much
more
at
his
ease
one
little
restriction
after
another
fell
away
from
him
he
went
and
came
with
absolute
freedom
not
only
without
having
to
account
for
his
movements
but
without
having
a
pang
for
not
doing
so
he
had
the
sensation
of
stretching
himself
after
a
cramping
posture
and
he
wrote
marcia
the
cheerfulest
letters
charging
her
not
to
cut
short
her
visit
from
anxiety
on
his
account
he
said
that
he
was
working
hard
but
hard
work
evidently
agreed
with
him
for
he
was
never
better
in
his
life
in
this
high
content
he
maintained
a
feeling
of
loyalty
by
going
to
the
hallecks
where
halleck
often
had
him
to
tea
in
pity
of
his
loneliness
they
were
dull
company
certainly
but
marcia
liked
them
and
the
cooking
was
always
good
other
evenings
he
went
to
the
theatres
where
there
were
amusing
variety
bills
and
sometimes
he
passed
the
night
at
nantasket
or
took
a
run
for
a
day
to
newport
he
always
reported
these
excursions
to
marcia
with
expressions
of
regret
that
equity
was
too
far
away
to
run
down
to
for
a
day
marcia
letters
were
longer
and
more
regular
than
his
but
he
could
have
forgiven
some
want
of
constancy
for
the
sake
of
a
less
searching
anxiety
on
her
part
she
was
anxious
not
only
for
his
welfare
which
was
natural
and
proper
but
she
was
anxious
about
the
housekeeping
and
the
expenses
things
bartley
could
not
afford
to
let
trouble
him
though
he
did
what
he
could
in
a
general
way
to
quiet
her
mind
she
wrote
fully
of
the
visit
which
olive
halleck
had
paid
her
but
said
that
they
had
not
gone
about
much
for
ben
halleck
had
only
been
able
to
come
for
a
day
she
was
very
well
and
so
was
flavia
bartley
realized
flavia
existence
with
an
effort
and
for
the
rest
this
letter
bored
him
what
could
he
care
about
olive
halleck
coming
or
ben
halleck
staying
away
all
that
he
asked
of
ben
halleck
was
a
little
extension
of
time
when
his
interest
fell
due
the
whole
thing
was
disagreeable
and
he
resented
what
he
considered
marcia
endeavor
to
clap
the
domestic
harness
on
him
again
his
thoughts
wandered
to
conditions
to
contingencies
of
which
a
man
does
not
permit
himself
even
to
think
without
a
degree
of
moral
disintegration
in
these
reveries
he
mused
upon
his
life
as
it
might
have
been
if
he
had
never
met
her
or
if
they
had
never
met
after
her
dismissal
of
him
as
he
recalled
the
facts
he
was
at
that
time
in
an
angry
and
embittered
mood
but
he
was
in
a
mood
of
entire
acquiescence
and
the
reconciliation
had
been
of
her
own
seeking
he
could
not
blame
her
for
it
she
was
very
much
in
love
with
him
and
he
had
been
fond
of
her
in
fact
he
was
still
very
fond
of
her
when
he
thought
of
little
ways
of
hers
it
filled
him
with
tenderness
he
did
justice
to
her
fine
qualities
too
her
generosity
her
truthfulness
her
entire
loyalty
to
his
best
interests
he
smiled
to
realize
that
he
himself
preferred
his
interests
and
in
her
absence
he
remembered
that
her
virtues
were
tedious
and
even
painful
at
times
he
had
his
doubts
whether
there
was
sufficient
compensation
in
them
he
sometimes
questioned
whether
he
had
not
made
a
great
mistake
to
get
married
he
expected
now
to
stick
it
through
but
this
doubt
occurred
to
him
a
moment
came
in
which
he
asked
himself
what
if
he
had
never
come
back
to
marcia
that
night
when
she
locked
him
out
of
her
room
might
it
not
have
been
better
for
both
of
them
she
would
soon
have
reconciled
herself
to
the
irreparable
he
even
thought
of
her
happy
in
a
second
marriage
and
the
thought
did
not
enrage
him
he
generously
wished
marcia
well
he
wished
he
hardly
knew
what
he
wished
he
wished
nothing
at
all
but
to
have
his
wife
and
child
back
again
as
soon
as
possible
and
he
put
aside
with
a
laugh
the
fancies
which
really
found
no
such
distinct
formulation
as
i
have
given
them
which
were
mere
vague
impulses
arrested
mental
tendencies
scraps
of
undirected
revery
their
recurrence
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
he
felt
to
be
his
sane
and
waking
state
but
they
recurred
and
he
even
amused
himself
in
turning
them
over
xxxi
one
morning
in
september
not
long
before
marcia
returned
bartley
found
witherby
at
the
office
waiting
for
him
witherby
wore
a
pensive
face
which
had
the
effect
of
being
studied
good
morning
hubbard
he
said
and
when
bartley
answered
good
morning
cheerfully
ignoring
his
mood
he
added
what
is
this
i
hear
hubbard
about
a
personal
misunderstanding
between
you
and
ricker
i
sure
i
do
know
said
bartley
but
i
suppose
that
if
you
have
heard
anything
i
have
heard
proceeded
witherby
a
little
dashed
by
bartley
coolness
that
ricker
accuses
you
of
having
used
material
in
that
article
you
sold
him
which
had
been
intrusted
to
you
under
the
seal
of
confidence
and
that
you
had
left
it
to
be
inferred
by
the
party
concerned
that
ricker
had
written
the
article
all
right
said
bartley
but
hubbard
said
witherby
struggling
to
rise
into
virtuous
supremacy
what
am
i
to
think
of
such
a
report
i
ca
say
unless
you
should
think
that
it
was
your
affair
that
would
be
the
easiest
but
i
think
that
hubbard
such
a
report
reflects
through
you
upon
the
events
it
reflects
upon
bartley
laughed
i
ca
approve
of
such
a
thing
if
you
admit
the
report
it
appears
to
me
that
you
have
a
done
a
a
wrong
action
bartley
turned
upon
him
with
a
curious
look
at
the
same
time
he
felt
a
pang
and
there
was
a
touch
of
real
anguish
in
the
sarcasm
of
his
demand
have
i
fallen
so
low
as
to
be
rebuked
by
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
such
an
expression
as
that
hubbard
said
witherby
i
do
know
what
i
done
to
forfeit
your
esteem
to
justify
you
in
using
such
language
to
i
do
suppose
you
really
do
said
bartley
go
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
hubbard
except
except
to
add
that
this
has
given
me
a
great
blow
a
blow
i
had
begun
to
have
my
doubts
before
as
to
whether
we
were
quite
adapted
to
each
other
and
this
has
increased
them
i
pass
no
judgment
upon
what
you
have
done
but
i
will
say
that
it
has
made
me
anxious
and
a
unrestful
it
has
made
me
ask
myself
whether
upon
the
whole
we
should
not
be
happier
apart
i
do
say
that
we
should
but
i
only
feel
that
nine
out
of
ten
business
men
would
consider
you
in
the
position
you
occupy
on
the
events
a
a
dangerous
bartley
got
up
from
his
desk
and
walked
toward
witherby
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
halted
a
few
paces
from
him
and
looked
down
on
him
with
a
sinister
smile
i
do
think
they
consider
you
a
dangerous
person
in
any
may
be
not
may
be
not
said
witherby
striving
to
be
easy
and
dignified
in
the
effort
he
took
up
an
open
paper
from
the
desk
before
him
and
lifting
it
between
bartley
and
himself
feigned
to
be
reading
it
bartley
struck
it
out
of
his
trembling
hands
you
impudent
old
scoundrel
do
you
pretend
to
be
reading
when
i
speak
to
you
for
half
a
cent
witherby
slipping
and
sliding
in
his
swivel
chair
contrived
to
get
to
his
feet
no
violence
hubbard
no
violence
violence
laughed
bartley
i
should
have
to
you
come
do
be
afraid
but
do
you
put
on
airs
of
any
sort
i
understand
your
game
you
want
for
some
reason
to
get
rid
of
me
and
you
have
seized
the
opportunity
with
a
sharpness
that
does
credit
to
your
cunning
i
condescend
to
deny
this
report
speaking
in
this
lofty
strain
bartley
had
a
momentary
sensation
of
its
being
a
despicable
slander
but
i
see
that
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
it
answers
all
the
purposes
of
truth
you
think
that
with
the
chance
of
having
this
thing
exploited
against
me
i
wo
expose
your
nefarious
practices
and
you
can
get
rid
of
me
more
safely
now
than
ever
you
could
again
well
you
right
i
dare
say
you
heard
of
this
report
a
good
while
ago
and
you
waited
till
you
could
fill
my
place
without
inconvenience
to
yourself
so
i
can
go
at
once
draw
your
check
for
all
you
owe
me
and
pay
me
back
the
money
i
put
into
your
stock
and
i
clear
out
at
he
went
about
putting
together
a
few
personal
effects
on
his
desk
i
must
protest
against
any
allusion
to
nefarious
practices
hubbard
said
witherby
and
i
wish
you
to
understand
that
i
part
from
you
without
the
slightest
i
shall
always
have
a
high
regard
for
your
ability
and
and
your
social
while
he
made
these
expressions
he
hastened
to
write
two
checks
bartley
who
had
paid
no
attention
to
what
witherby
was
saying
came
up
and
took
the
checks
this
is
all
right
he
said
of
one
but
looking
at
the
other
he
added
fifteen
hundred
dollars
where
is
the
dividend
that
is
not
due
till
the
end
of
the
month
said
witherby
if
you
withdraw
your
money
now
you
lose
bartley
looked
at
the
face
to
which
witherby
did
his
best
to
give
a
high
judicial
expression
you
old
thief
he
said
almost
affectionately
i
a
mind
to
tweak
your
nose
but
he
went
out
of
the
room
without
saying
or
doing
anything
more
he
wondered
a
little
at
his
own
amiability
but
with
the
decay
of
whatever
was
in
him
he
was
aware
of
growing
more
and
more
incapable
of
indignation
now
his
flash
of
rage
over
he
was
not
at
all
discontented
with
these
checks
in
his
pocket
with
his
youth
his
health
and
his
practised
hand
he
could
have
faced
the
world
with
a
light
heart
if
he
had
not
also
had
to
face
his
wife
but
when
he
thought
of
the
inconvenience
of
explaining
to
her
of
pacifying
her
anxiety
of
clearing
up
her
doubts
on
a
thousand
points
and
of
getting
her
simply
to
eat
or
sleep
till
he
found
something
else
to
do
it
dismayed
him
good
lord
he
said
to
himself
i
wish
i
was
dead
or
some
that
conclusion
made
him
smile
again
he
decided
not
to
write
to
marcia
of
the
change
in
his
affairs
but
to
take
the
chance
of
finding
something
better
before
she
returned
there
was
very
little
time
for
him
to
turn
round
and
he
was
still
without
a
place
or
any
prospect
when
she
came
home
it
had
sufficed
with
his
acquaintance
when
he
said
that
he
had
left
the
events
because
he
could
not
get
on
with
witherby
but
he
was
very
much
astonished
when
it
seemed
to
suffice
with
her
oh
well
she
said
i
am
glad
of
it
you
will
do
better
by
yourself
and
i
know
you
can
earn
just
as
much
by
writing
on
the
different
bartley
knew
better
than
this
but
he
said
yes
i
shall
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
take
another
engagement
just
yet
but
marsh
he
added
i
was
afraid
you
would
blame
me
think
i
had
been
reckless
or
at
fault
no
she
answered
after
a
little
pause
i
shall
not
do
that
any
more
i
have
been
thinking
all
these
things
over
while
i
was
away
from
you
and
i
going
to
do
differently
after
this
i
shall
believe
that
you
acted
for
the
best
that
you
not
meant
to
do
wrong
in
anything
and
i
shall
never
question
you
or
doubt
you
any
is
that
giving
me
rather
too
rope
asked
bartley
with
lightness
that
masked
a
vague
alarm
lest
the
old
times
of
exaction
should
be
coming
back
with
the
old
times
of
devotion
no
i
see
where
my
mistake
has
always
been
i
always
asked
too
much
and
expected
too
much
even
when
i
did
ask
it
now
i
shall
be
satisfied
with
what
you
do
do
as
well
as
what
you
i
shall
try
to
live
up
to
my
privileges
said
bartley
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
gave
her
a
kiss
and
then
he
unclasped
kinney
nugget
from
his
and
fastened
it
on
the
baby
necklace
which
lay
in
a
box
marcia
had
just
taken
from
her
trunk
she
did
not
speak
but
bartley
felt
better
to
have
the
thing
off
him
marcia
gentleness
the
tinge
of
sadness
in
her
tone
made
him
long
to
confess
himself
wrong
in
the
whole
matter
and
justly
punished
by
ricker
contempt
and
witherby
dismissal
but
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
trust
her
to
forgive
him
and
he
felt
himself
unable
to
go
through
all
that
without
the
certainty
of
her
forgiveness
as
she
took
the
things
out
of
her
trunk
and
laid
them
away
in
this
drawer
and
that
she
spoke
of
events
in
the
village
and
told
who
was
dead
who
was
married
and
who
had
gone
away
i
stayed
longer
than
i
expected
a
little
because
father
seemed
to
want
me
to
i
do
think
mother
so
well
as
she
used
to
be
i
i
afraid
she
seems
to
be
failing
her
voice
dropped
to
a
lower
key
and
bartley
said
i
sorry
to
hear
that
i
guess
she
is
failing
but
of
course
she
getting
on
and
every
year
makes
a
yes
that
must
be
it
she
answered
looking
at
a
bundle
of
collars
she
had
in
her
hand
as
if
absorbed
in
the
question
as
to
where
she
should
put
them
before
they
slept
that
night
she
asked
bartley
did
you
hear
about
hannah
morrison
no
what
about
her
she
gone
gone
away
the
last
time
she
was
seen
was
in
portland
they
do
know
what
become
of
her
they
say
that
henry
bird
is
about
but
everybody
knows
she
never
cared
for
him
i
hated
to
write
to
you
about
bartley
experienced
so
disagreeable
a
sensation
that
he
was
silent
for
a
time
then
he
gave
a
short
bitter
laugh
well
that
what
it
was
bound
to
come
to
sooner
or
later
i
suppose
it
a
piece
of
good
luck
for
bartley
went
about
picking
up
work
from
one
paper
and
another
but
not
securing
a
basis
on
any
in
that
curious
and
unwholesome
leniency
which
corrupt
natures
manifest
he
and
witherby
met
at
their
next
encounter
on
quite
amicable
terms
bartley
reported
some
meetings
for
the
events
and
experienced
no
resentment
when
witherby
at
the
office
introduced
him
to
the
gentleman
with
whom
he
had
replaced
him
of
course
bartley
expected
that
witherby
would
insinuate
things
to
his
disadvantage
but
he
did
not
mind
that
he
heard
of
something
of
the
sort
being
done
in
ricker
presence
and
of
ricker
saying
that
in
any
question
of
honor
and
veracity
between
witherby
and
hubbard
he
should
decide
for
hubbard
bartley
was
not
very
grateful
for
this
generous
defence
he
thought
that
if
ricker
had
not
been
such
an
ass
in
the
first
place
there
would
have
been
no
trouble
between
them
and
witherby
would
not
have
had
that
handle
against
him
he
was
enjoying
himself
very
well
and
he
felt
entitled
to
the
comparative
rest
which
had
not
been
of
his
seeking
he
wished
that
halleck
would
come
back
for
he
would
like
to
ask
his
leave
to
put
that
money
into
some
other
enterprise
his
credit
was
good
and
he
had
not
touched
the
money
to
pay
any
of
his
accumulated
bills
he
would
have
considered
it
dishonorable
to
do
so
but
it
annoyed
him
to
have
the
money
lying
idle
in
his
leisure
he
studied
the
stock
market
and
he
believed
that
he
had
several
points
which
were
infallible
he
put
a
few
hundreds
two
or
three
of
halleck
money
into
a
mining
stock
which
was
so
low
that
it
rise
in
the
mean
time
he
tried
a
new
kind
of
beer
norwegian
beer
which
he
found
a
little
lighter
even
than
tivoli
it
was
more
expensive
but
it
was
light
and
it
was
essential
to
bartley
to
drink
the
lightest
beer
he
could
find
he
stayed
a
good
deal
at
home
now
for
he
had
leisure
and
it
was
a
much
more
comfortable
place
since
marcia
had
ceased
to
question
or
reproach
him
she
did
not
interfere
with
some
bachelor
habits
he
had
formed
in
her
absence
of
sleeping
far
into
the
forenoon
he
now
occasionally
did
on
some
of
the
morning
papers
and
the
rest
was
necessary
he
had
his
breakfast
whenever
he
got
up
as
if
he
had
been
at
a
hotel
he
wondered
upon
what
new
theory
she
was
really
treating
him
but
he
had
always
been
apt
to
accept
what
was
comfortable
in
life
without
much
question
and
he
did
not
wonder
long
he
was
immensely
now
in
his
frequent
leisure
he
went
out
to
walk
with
marcia
and
flavia
and
sometimes
he
took
the
little
girl
alone
he
even
went
to
church
with
them
one
sunday
and
called
at
the
hallecks
as
often
as
marcia
liked
the
young
ladies
had
returned
but
ben
halleck
was
still
away
it
made
bartley
smile
to
hear
his
wife
talking
of
halleck
with
his
mother
and
sisters
and
falling
quite
into
the
family
way
of
regarding
him
as
if
he
were
somehow
a
saint
and
martyr
bartley
was
still
dabbling
in
stocks
with
halleck
money
some
of
it
had
lately
gone
to
pay
an
assessment
which
had
unexpectedly
occurred
in
place
of
a
dividend
he
told
marcia
that
he
was
holding
the
money
ready
to
return
to
halleck
when
he
came
back
or
to
put
it
into
some
other
enterprise
where
it
would
help
to
secure
bartley
a
new
basis
they
were
now
together
more
than
they
had
been
since
the
first
days
of
their
married
life
in
boston
but
the
perfect
intimacy
of
those
days
was
gone
he
had
his
reserves
and
she
her
preoccupations
with
the
house
with
the
little
girl
with
her
anxiety
about
her
mother
sometimes
they
sat
a
whole
evening
together
with
almost
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
he
reading
and
she
sewing
after
an
evening
of
this
sort
bartley
felt
himself
worse
bored
than
if
marcia
had
spent
it
in
taking
him
to
task
as
she
used
to
do
once
he
looked
at
her
over
the
top
of
his
paper
and
distinctly
experienced
that
he
was
tired
of
the
whole
thing
but
the
political
canvass
was
growing
more
interesting
now
it
was
almost
the
end
of
october
and
the
had
become
very
lively
the
democrats
were
hopeful
and
the
republicans
resolute
and
both
parties
were
active
in
getting
out
their
whole
strength
as
the
saying
is
at
such
times
this
was
done
not
only
by
but
by
long
nocturnal
processions
of
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
drums
throbbed
and
horns
brayed
and
the
feverish
excitement
spread
its
contagion
through
the
whole
population
but
it
did
not
affect
bartley
he
had
cared
nothing
about
the
canvass
from
the
beginning
having
an
equal
contempt
for
the
bloody
shirt
of
the
republicans
and
the
reform
pretensions
of
the
democrats
the
only
thing
that
he
took
an
interest
in
was
the
betting
he
laid
his
wagers
with
so
much
apparent
science
and
sagacity
that
he
had
a
certain
following
of
young
men
who
bet
as
hubbard
did
hubbard
they
believed
had
a
long
head
he
disdained
bets
of
hats
and
of
barrels
of
apples
and
ordeals
by
wheelbarrow
he
would
bet
only
with
people
who
could
put
up
their
money
and
his
followers
honored
him
for
it
when
asked
where
he
got
his
money
being
out
of
place
and
no
longer
instant
to
do
work
that
fell
in
his
way
they
answered
from
a
ready
faith
that
he
had
made
a
good
thing
in
mining
stocks
in
her
heart
marcia
probably
did
not
share
this
faith
but
she
faithfully
forbore
to
harass
bartley
with
her
doubts
and
on
those
evenings
when
he
found
her
such
dull
company
she
was
silent
because
if
she
spoke
she
must
express
the
trouble
in
her
mind
women
are
more
apt
to
theorize
their
husbands
than
men
in
their
stupid
ever
realize
when
a
man
is
married
his
wife
almost
ceases
to
be
exterior
to
his
consciousness
she
afflicts
or
consoles
him
like
a
condition
of
health
or
sickness
she
is
literally
part
of
him
in
a
spiritual
sense
even
when
he
is
rather
indifferent
to
her
but
the
most
devoted
wife
has
always
a
corner
of
her
soul
in
which
she
thinks
of
her
husband
as
in
which
she
philosophizes
him
wholly
aloof
from
herself
in
such
an
obscure
fastness
of
her
being
marcia
had
meditated
a
great
deal
upon
bartley
during
her
absence
at
equity
meditated
painfully
and
in
her
sort
prayerfully
upon
him
she
perceived
that
he
was
not
her
young
dream
of
him
and
since
it
appeared
to
her
that
she
could
not
forego
that
dream
and
live
she
could
but
accuse
herself
of
having
somehow
had
a
perverse
influence
upon
him
she
knew
that
she
had
never
reproached
him
except
for
his
good
but
she
saw
too
that
she
had
always
made
him
worse
and
not
better
she
recurred
to
what
he
said
the
first
night
they
arrived
in
boston
i
believe
that
if
you
have
faith
in
me
i
shall
get
along
and
when
you
do
i
shall
go
to
the
she
could
reason
to
no
other
effect
than
that
hereafter
no
matter
what
happened
she
must
show
perfect
faith
in
him
by
perfect
patience
it
was
hard
far
harder
than
she
had
thought
but
she
did
forbear
she
did
use
patience
the
election
day
came
and
went
bartley
remained
out
till
the
news
of
tilden
success
could
no
longer
be
doubted
and
then
came
home
jubilant
marcia
seemed
not
to
understand
i
did
know
you
cared
so
much
for
tilden
she
said
quietly
mr
halleck
is
for
hayes
and
ben
halleck
was
coming
home
to
that
all
right
a
vote
in
massachusetts
makes
no
difference
i
for
tilden
because
i
have
the
most
money
up
on
him
the
success
of
that
noble
old
reformer
is
worth
seven
hundred
dollars
to
me
in
bartley
laughed
rubbed
her
cheeks
with
his
chilly
hands
and
went
down
into
the
cellar
for
some
beer
he
could
not
have
slept
without
that
in
his
excitement
but
he
was
out
very
early
the
next
morning
and
in
the
raw
damp
of
the
rainy
november
day
he
received
a
more
penetrating
chill
when
he
saw
the
bulletins
at
the
newspaper
offices
intimating
that
a
fair
count
might
give
the
republicans
enough
southern
states
to
elect
hayes
this
appeared
to
bartley
the
most
impudent
piece
of
political
effrontery
in
the
whole
history
of
the
country
and
among
those
who
went
about
denouncing
republican
chicanery
at
the
democratic
no
one
took
a
loftier
tone
of
moral
indignation
than
he
the
thought
that
he
might
lose
so
much
of
halleck
money
through
the
machinations
of
a
parcel
of
tricksters
filled
him
with
a
virtue
at
which
he
afterwards
smiled
when
he
found
that
people
were
declaring
their
bets
off
i
laid
a
wager
on
the
popular
result
not
on
the
decision
of
the
returning
boards
he
said
in
reclaiming
his
money
from
the
referees
he
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
it
back
but
he
had
got
it
when
he
walked
homeward
at
night
after
having
been
out
all
day
and
there
now
ensued
in
his
soul
a
struggle
as
to
what
he
should
do
with
this
money
he
had
it
all
except
the
three
hundred
he
had
ventured
on
the
mining
stock
which
would
eventually
he
worth
everything
he
had
paid
for
it
after
his
frightful
escape
from
losing
half
of
it
on
those
bets
he
had
an
intense
longing
to
be
rid
of
it
to
give
it
back
to
halleck
who
never
would
ask
him
for
it
and
then
to
go
home
and
tell
marcia
everything
and
throw
himself
on
her
mercy
better
poverty
better
disgrace
before
halleck
and
her
better
her
condemnation
than
this
life
of
temptation
that
he
had
been
leading
he
saw
how
hideous
it
was
in
the
retrospect
and
he
shuddered
his
good
instincts
awoke
and
put
forth
their
strength
such
as
it
was
tears
came
into
his
eyes
he
resolved
to
write
to
kinney
and
exonerate
ricker
he
resolved
humbly
to
beg
ricker
pardon
he
must
leave
boston
but
if
marcia
would
forgive
him
he
would
go
back
with
her
to
equity
and
take
up
the
study
of
the
law
in
her
father
office
again
and
fulfil
all
her
wishes
he
would
have
a
hard
time
to
overcome
the
old
man
prejudices
but
he
deserved
a
hard
time
and
he
knew
he
should
finally
succeed
it
would
be
bitter
returning
to
that
stupid
little
town
and
he
imagined
the
intrusive
conjecture
and
sarcastic
comment
that
would
attend
his
return
but
he
believed
that
he
could
live
this
down
and
he
trusted
himself
to
laugh
it
down
he
already
saw
himself
there
settled
in
the
squire
office
reinstated
in
public
opinion
a
leading
lawyer
of
the
place
with
congress
open
before
him
whenever
he
chose
to
turn
his
face
that
way
he
had
thought
of
going
first
to
halleck
and
returning
the
money
but
he
was
willing
to
give
himself
the
encouragement
of
marcia
pleasure
of
her
forgiveness
and
her
praise
in
an
affair
that
had
its
difficulties
and
would
require
all
his
manfulness
the
maid
met
him
at
the
door
with
little
flavia
and
told
him
that
marcia
had
gone
out
to
the
hallecks
but
had
left
word
that
she
would
soon
return
and
that
then
they
would
have
supper
together
her
absence
dashed
his
warm
impulse
but
he
recovered
himself
and
took
the
little
one
from
the
maid
he
lighted
the
gas
in
the
parlor
and
had
a
frolic
with
flavia
in
kindling
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
making
the
room
bright
and
cheerful
he
played
with
the
child
and
made
her
laugh
he
already
felt
the
pleasure
of
a
good
conscience
though
with
a
faint
nether
ache
in
his
heart
which
was
perhaps
only
his
wish
to
have
the
disagreeable
preliminaries
to
his
better
life
over
as
soon
as
possible
he
drew
two
up
at
opposite
corners
of
the
hearth
and
sat
down
in
one
leaving
the
other
for
marcia
he
had
flavia
standing
on
his
knees
and
clinging
fast
to
his
fingers
laughing
and
crowing
while
he
danced
her
up
and
down
when
he
heard
the
front
door
open
and
marcia
burst
into
the
room
she
ran
to
him
and
plucked
the
child
from
him
and
then
went
back
as
far
as
she
could
from
him
in
the
room
crying
give
the
child
and
facing
him
with
the
look
he
knew
her
eyes
were
dilated
and
her
visage
white
with
the
transport
that
had
whirled
her
far
beyond
the
reach
of
reason
the
frail
structure
of
his
good
resolutions
dropped
to
ruin
at
the
sight
but
he
mechanically
rose
and
advanced
upon
her
till
she
forbade
him
with
a
muffled
shriek
of
do
me
so
she
went
on
gasping
and
catching
her
breath
it
was
i
might
have
known
it
i
might
have
guessed
it
from
the
first
was
the
reason
why
you
did
care
to
have
me
hurry
home
this
summer
was
that
was
that
she
choked
and
convulsively
pressed
her
face
into
the
neck
of
the
child
which
began
to
cry
bartley
closed
the
doors
and
then
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
confronted
her
with
a
smile
of
wicked
coolness
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
you
talking
about
do
you
pretend
that
you
do
know
i
met
a
woman
at
the
bottom
of
the
street
just
now
do
you
know
who
no
but
it
very
dramatic
go
on
it
was
hannah
morrison
she
reeled
against
me
and
when
i
such
a
fool
as
i
was
pitied
her
because
i
was
on
my
way
home
to
you
and
was
thinking
about
you
and
loving
you
and
was
so
happy
in
it
and
asked
her
how
she
came
to
that
she
me
and
told
me
to
to
ask
my
husband
the
transport
broke
in
tears
the
denunciation
had
turned
to
entreaty
in
everything
but
words
but
bartley
had
hardened
his
heart
now
past
all
entreaty
the
idiotic
penitent
that
he
had
been
a
few
moments
ago
the
soft
dolt
was
so
far
from
him
now
as
to
be
scarce
within
the
reach
of
his
contempt
he
was
going
to
have
this
thing
over
once
for
all
he
would
have
no
mercy
upon
himself
or
upon
her
the
devil
was
in
him
and
uppermost
in
him
and
the
devil
is
fierce
and
proud
and
knows
how
to
make
many
base
emotions
feel
like
a
just
and
did
you
believe
a
woman
like
that
he
sneered
do
i
believe
a
man
like
this
she
demanded
with
a
dying
flash
of
her
fury
you
you
do
dare
to
deny
oh
no
i
do
deny
it
for
one
reason
it
would
be
of
no
use
for
all
practical
purposes
i
admit
it
what
then
what
then
she
asked
bewildered
bartley
you
do
mean
it
yes
i
do
i
mean
it
i
deny
it
what
then
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
she
gazed
at
him
in
incredulous
horror
come
i
mean
what
i
say
what
will
you
do
oh
merciful
god
what
shall
i
do
she
prayed
aloud
that
just
what
i
curious
to
know
when
you
leaped
in
here
just
now
you
must
have
meant
to
do
something
if
i
could
convince
you
that
the
woman
was
lying
well
you
see
that
i
do
try
i
give
you
leave
to
believe
whatever
she
said
what
then
bartley
she
besought
him
in
her
despair
do
you
drive
me
from
you
oh
no
certainly
not
that
is
my
way
you
have
driven
me
from
you
and
i
might
claim
the
right
to
retaliate
but
i
do
i
no
expectation
that
you
go
away
and
i
want
to
see
what
else
you
do
you
would
have
me
before
we
were
married
you
were
tolerably
shameless
in
getting
me
when
your
jealous
temper
made
you
throw
me
away
you
could
live
till
you
got
me
back
again
you
ran
after
me
well
i
suppose
you
learnt
wisdom
now
at
least
you
wo
try
game
again
but
what
you
do
he
looked
at
her
smiling
while
he
dealt
her
these
stabs
one
by
one
she
set
down
the
child
and
went
out
to
the
entry
where
its
hat
and
cloak
hung
she
had
not
taken
off
her
own
things
and
now
she
began
to
put
on
the
little
one
garments
with
shaking
hands
kneeling
before
it
i
will
never
live
with
you
again
bartley
she
said
very
well
i
doubt
it
as
far
as
you
concerned
but
if
you
go
away
now
you
certainly
live
with
me
again
for
i
shall
not
let
you
come
back
understand
each
had
most
need
of
the
other
mercy
but
neither
would
have
mercy
it
is
for
what
you
wo
deny
i
do
believe
that
it
for
what
you
said
she
could
not
make
the
buttons
and
the
of
the
child
sack
meet
with
her
quivering
fingers
he
actually
stooped
down
and
buttoned
the
little
garment
for
her
as
if
they
had
been
going
to
take
the
child
out
for
a
walk
between
them
she
caught
it
up
in
her
arms
and
sobbing
good
by
bartley
ran
out
of
the
room
recollect
that
if
you
go
you
do
come
back
he
said
the
outer
door
crashing
to
behind
her
was
his
answer
he
sat
down
to
think
before
the
fire
he
had
built
for
her
it
was
blazing
brightly
now
and
the
whole
room
had
a
hideous
cosiness
he
could
not
think
he
must
act
he
went
up
to
their
room
where
the
gas
was
burning
low
as
if
she
had
lighted
it
and
then
frugally
turned
it
down
as
her
wont
was
he
did
not
know
what
his
purpose
was
but
it
developed
itself
he
began
to
pack
his
things
in
a
which
he
took
out
of
the
closet
and
which
he
had
bought
for
her
when
she
set
out
for
equity
in
the
summer
it
had
the
perfume
of
her
dresses
yet
when
this
was
finished
he
went
down
stairs
again
and
being
now
strangely
hungry
he
made
a
meal
of
such
things
as
he
found
set
out
on
the
then
he
went
over
the
papers
in
his
secretary
he
burnt
some
of
them
and
put
others
into
his
bag
after
all
this
was
done
he
sat
down
by
the
fire
again
and
gave
marcia
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
in
which
to
return
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
afraid
that
she
would
or
would
not
come
but
when
the
time
ended
he
took
up
his
bag
and
went
out
of
the
house
it
began
to
rain
and
he
went
back
for
an
umbrella
he
gave
her
that
one
chance
more
and
he
ran
up
into
their
room
but
she
had
not
come
back
he
went
out
again
and
hurried
away
through
the
rain
to
the
albany
depot
where
he
bought
a
ticket
for
chicago
there
was
as
yet
nothing
definite
in
his
purpose
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
to
be
rid
of
her
whether
for
a
long
or
short
time
or
forever
he
did
not
yet
know
whether
he
meant
ever
to
communicate
with
her
or
seek
or
suffer
a
reconciliation
the
locomotive
that
leaped
westward
into
the
dark
with
him
knew
as
well
as
he
yet
all
the
mute
obscure
forces
of
habit
which
are
doubtless
the
strongest
forces
in
human
nature
were
dragging
him
back
to
her
because
their
lives
had
been
united
so
long
it
seemed
impossible
to
sever
them
though
their
union
had
been
so
full
of
misery
and
discord
the
custom
of
marriage
was
so
subtile
and
so
pervasive
that
his
heart
demanded
her
sympathy
for
what
he
was
suffering
in
abandoning
her
the
solitude
into
which
he
had
plunged
stretched
before
him
so
vast
so
sterile
and
hopeless
that
he
had
not
the
courage
to
realize
it
he
insensibly
began
to
give
it
limits
he
would
return
after
so
many
months
weeks
days
he
passed
hours
on
the
train
and
left
it
at
cleveland
for
the
it
stopped
for
supper
but
he
could
not
eat
he
had
to
own
to
himself
that
he
was
beaten
and
that
he
must
return
or
throw
himself
into
the
lake
he
ran
hastily
to
the
and
effected
the
removal
of
his
bag
then
he
went
to
the
and
waited
at
the
end
of
a
long
queue
for
his
turn
at
the
window
his
turn
came
at
last
and
he
confronted
the
nervous
and
impatient
without
speaking
well
sir
what
do
you
want
demanded
the
agent
then
with
rising
temper
what
is
it
are
you
deaf
are
you
dumb
you
ca
expect
to
stand
there
all
night
the
policeman
outside
the
rail
laid
his
hand
on
bartley
shoulder
move
on
my
he
obeyed
and
reeled
away
in
a
fashion
that
confirmed
the
suspicions
he
searched
his
pockets
again
and
again
but
his
was
in
none
of
them
it
had
been
stolen
and
halleck
money
with
the
rest
now
he
could
not
return
nothing
remained
for
him
but
the
ruin
he
had
chosen
xxxii
halleck
prolonged
his
summer
vacation
beyond
the
end
of
october
he
had
been
in
town
from
time
to
time
and
then
had
set
off
again
on
some
new
absence
he
was
so
restless
and
so
far
from
well
during
the
last
of
these
flying
visits
that
the
old
people
were
glad
when
he
wrote
them
that
he
should
stay
as
long
as
the
fine
weather
continued
he
spoke
of
an
interesting
man
whom
he
had
met
at
the
mountain
resort
where
he
was
staying
a
attached
to
one
of
the
legations
at
washington
who
had
a
scheme
for
americanizing
popular
education
in
his
own
country
he
has
made
a
regular
set
at
me
halleck
wrote
and
if
i
had
not
fooled
away
so
much
time
already
on
law
and
on
leather
i
should
like
to
fool
away
a
little
more
on
such
a
cause
as
he
did
not
mention
the
matter
again
in
his
letters
but
the
first
night
after
his
return
when
they
all
sat
together
in
the
comfort
of
having
him
at
home
again
he
asked
his
father
what
should
you
think
of
my
going
to
south
america
the
old
man
started
up
from
the
pleasant
drowse
into
which
he
was
suffering
himself
to
fall
content
with
halleck
presence
and
willing
to
leave
the
talk
to
the
women
folk
i
do
know
what
you
mean
ben
i
suppose
it
my
having
the
matter
so
much
in
mind
that
makes
me
feel
as
if
we
had
talked
it
over
i
mentioned
it
in
one
of
my
yes
returned
his
father
but
i
presumed
you
were
halleck
frowned
impatiently
he
would
not
meet
the
gaze
of
his
mother
and
sisters
but
he
addressed
himself
again
to
his
father
i
do
know
that
i
was
in
his
mother
dropped
her
eyes
to
her
mending
with
a
faint
sigh
of
relief
but
i
ca
say
he
added
that
i
was
joking
exactly
the
man
himself
was
very
serious
about
he
stopped
apparently
to
govern
an
irritable
impulse
and
then
he
went
on
to
set
the
project
of
his
acquaintance
before
them
explaining
it
in
detail
at
the
end
that
good
said
his
father
but
why
need
have
gone
ben
the
question
seemed
to
vex
halleck
he
did
not
answer
at
once
his
mother
could
not
bear
to
see
him
crossed
and
she
came
to
his
help
against
herself
and
his
father
since
it
was
only
supposing
the
case
i
presume
she
said
that
we
could
have
looked
at
it
as
a
missionary
it
is
a
missionary
work
mother
answered
halleck
severely
in
any
sense
that
you
mean
i
should
go
down
there
to
teach
and
i
should
be
paid
for
it
and
i
want
to
say
at
once
that
they
have
no
nor
earthquakes
and
that
they
have
not
had
a
revolution
for
six
years
the
country
perfectly
safe
every
way
and
so
wholesome
that
it
will
be
a
good
thing
for
me
but
i
should
expect
to
convert
of
course
not
ben
said
his
mother
soothingly
i
hope
you
would
object
to
it
if
it
a
missionary
work
said
one
of
the
elder
sisters
no
anna
returned
ben
i
merely
wanted
to
know
said
anna
then
i
hope
you
satisfied
anna
olive
cut
in
ben
wo
refuse
to
convert
the
uruguayans
if
they
apply
in
a
proper
i
think
anna
had
a
right
to
ask
said
miss
louisa
the
eldest
oh
undoubtedly
miss
halleck
said
olive
i
like
to
see
ben
reproved
for
misbehavior
to
his
mother
her
father
laughed
at
olive
prompt
defence
well
it
a
cause
that
we
all
got
to
respect
but
i
do
see
why
should
go
ben
as
i
said
before
it
would
do
very
well
for
some
young
fellow
who
had
no
settled
prospects
but
you
got
your
duties
here
i
presume
you
looked
at
it
in
that
light
as
you
said
in
your
letter
you
fooled
away
so
much
time
on
leather
and
law
i
shall
never
amount
to
anything
in
the
law
ben
broke
out
his
mother
looked
at
him
in
anxiety
his
father
kept
a
steady
smile
on
his
face
olive
sat
alert
for
any
chance
that
offered
to
put
down
her
elder
sisters
who
drew
in
their
breath
and
grew
silently
a
little
primmer
i
not
well
oh
i
know
you
not
dear
interrupted
his
mother
glad
of
another
chance
to
abet
him
i
not
strong
enough
to
go
on
with
the
line
of
work
i
marked
out
and
i
feel
that
i
throwing
away
the
feeble
powers
i
his
father
answered
with
less
surprise
than
halleck
had
evidently
expected
for
he
had
thrown
out
his
words
with
a
sort
of
defiance
probably
the
old
man
had
watched
him
closely
enough
to
surmise
that
it
might
come
to
this
with
him
at
last
at
any
rate
he
was
able
to
say
without
seeming
to
assent
too
readily
well
well
give
up
the
law
then
and
come
back
into
leather
as
you
call
it
or
take
up
something
else
we
do
wish
to
make
anything
a
burden
to
you
but
take
up
some
useful
work
at
home
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
be
not
for
me
said
halleck
gloomily
oh
yes
there
are
said
the
old
man
i
see
you
are
not
willing
to
have
me
go
said
halleck
rising
in
uncontrollable
irritation
but
i
wish
you
would
all
take
this
tone
with
me
we
have
taken
any
tone
with
you
ben
said
his
mother
with
pleading
tenderness
i
think
anna
has
decidedly
taken
a
tone
said
olive
anna
did
not
retort
but
what
tone
demanded
louisa
in
her
behalf
hush
children
said
their
mother
well
well
suggested
his
father
to
ben
think
it
over
think
it
over
there
no
i
thought
it
over
there
hurry
retorted
halleck
if
i
go
i
must
go
at
his
mother
arrested
her
thread
half
drawn
through
the
seam
letting
her
hand
drop
while
she
glanced
at
him
it
is
so
much
a
question
of
your
giving
up
the
law
ben
as
of
your
giving
up
your
family
and
going
so
far
away
from
us
all
said
his
father
that
what
i
should
i
do
like
that
either
but
i
ca
help
he
added
of
course
mother
i
shall
not
go
without
your
full
and
free
consent
you
and
father
must
settle
it
between
he
fetched
a
quick
worried
sigh
as
he
put
his
hand
on
the
door
ben
is
himself
at
all
said
halleck
with
tears
in
her
eyes
after
he
had
left
the
room
no
said
her
husband
he
restless
he
get
over
this
idea
in
a
few
he
urged
this
hope
against
his
wife
despair
and
argued
himself
into
low
spirits
i
do
believe
but
what
it
be
the
best
thing
for
his
health
may
be
said
halleck
at
the
end
i
always
had
my
doubts
whether
he
would
ever
come
to
anything
in
the
law
said
the
father
the
elder
sisters
discussed
halleck
project
apart
between
themselves
as
their
wont
was
with
any
family
interest
and
they
bent
over
a
map
of
south
america
so
as
to
hide
what
they
were
doing
from
their
mother
olive
had
left
the
room
by
another
door
and
she
intercepted
halleck
before
he
reached
his
own
what
is
the
matter
ben
she
whispered
nothing
he
answered
coldly
but
he
added
come
in
she
followed
him
and
hovered
near
after
he
turned
up
the
gas
i
ca
stand
it
here
i
must
go
he
said
turning
a
dull
weary
look
upon
her
who
was
at
the
elm
house
that
you
knew
this
last
time
she
asked
quickly
laura
dixmore
is
driving
me
away
if
you
mean
that
replied
halleck
i
believe
it
was
she
i
should
have
despised
you
if
it
was
but
i
shall
hate
her
whoever
it
halleck
sat
down
before
his
table
and
his
sister
sank
upon
the
corner
of
a
chair
near
it
and
looked
wistfully
at
him
i
know
there
is
some
one
if
you
think
i
been
fool
enough
to
offer
myself
to
any
one
olive
you
very
much
oh
it
need
have
come
to
that
said
olive
with
indignant
pity
my
life
a
failure
here
cried
halleck
moving
his
head
uneasily
from
side
to
side
i
feel
somehow
as
if
i
could
go
out
there
and
pick
up
the
time
i
lost
great
heaven
he
cried
if
i
were
only
running
away
from
some
innocent
young
girl
rejection
what
a
happy
man
i
should
be
it
some
horrid
married
thing
then
that
been
flirting
with
you
he
gave
a
forlorn
laugh
i
almost
confess
it
to
please
you
olive
but
i
prefer
to
get
out
of
the
matter
without
lying
if
i
could
why
need
you
suppose
any
reason
but
the
sufficient
one
i
given
do
afflict
me
do
imagine
things
about
me
do
make
a
mystery
of
me
i
been
blunt
and
awkward
and
i
bungled
the
business
with
father
and
mother
but
i
want
to
get
away
because
i
a
miserable
fraud
here
and
i
think
i
might
rub
on
a
good
while
there
before
i
found
myself
out
ben
demanded
olive
regardless
of
his
words
what
have
you
been
doing
the
old
story
is
that
true
ben
you
used
to
be
satisfied
with
asking
once
you
been
so
wicked
so
careless
as
to
get
some
poor
creature
in
love
with
you
and
then
want
to
run
away
from
the
misery
you
made
i
suppose
if
i
look
it
there
no
use
denying
it
said
halleck
letting
his
sad
eyes
meet
hers
and
smiling
drearily
you
insist
upon
having
a
lady
in
the
case
yes
but
i
see
you
wo
tell
me
anything
and
i
afflict
you
only
i
afraid
it
just
some
silly
thing
that
you
got
to
brooding
over
and
that
you
let
drive
you
well
you
have
the
comfort
of
reflecting
that
i
ca
get
away
whatever
the
pressure
you
know
better
than
that
ben
and
so
do
i
you
know
that
if
you
got
father
and
mother
consent
already
it
only
because
you
have
had
the
heart
to
ask
for
it
as
far
as
that
concerned
you
gone
already
but
i
hope
you
wo
go
without
thinking
it
over
as
father
says
and
talking
it
over
i
hate
to
have
you
seem
unsteady
and
when
i
know
you
not
and
i
going
to
set
myself
against
this
project
till
i
know
what
driving
you
from
us
or
till
i
sure
that
it
something
worth
while
you
need
expect
that
i
shall
help
to
make
it
easy
for
you
i
shall
help
to
make
it
her
loving
looks
belied
her
threats
if
the
others
could
not
resist
ben
when
any
sort
of
desire
showed
itself
through
his
habitual
listlessness
how
could
she
who
understood
him
best
and
sympathized
with
him
most
there
was
something
i
was
going
to
talk
to
you
about
if
you
had
scared
us
all
with
this
ridiculous
scheme
and
ask
you
whether
you
could
do
she
seemed
to
suggest
the
change
of
interest
with
the
hope
of
winning
his
thoughts
away
from
the
direction
they
had
taken
but
he
listened
apathetically
and
left
her
to
go
further
or
not
as
she
chose
i
think
she
added
abruptly
that
some
trouble
is
hanging
over
those
wretched
some
new
one
asked
halleck
with
sad
sarcasm
turning
his
eyes
towards
her
as
if
with
the
resolution
of
facing
her
you
know
he
left
his
place
on
that
yes
i
heard
that
when
i
was
at
home
there
are
some
very
disagreeable
stories
about
it
they
say
he
was
turned
away
by
witherby
for
behaving
badly
for
printing
something
he
ought
to
have
that
was
to
have
been
expected
said
halleck
he
has
found
any
other
place
and
marcia
says
he
gets
very
little
work
to
do
he
must
be
running
into
debt
terribly
i
feel
very
anxious
about
them
i
do
know
what
they
living
probably
on
some
money
i
lent
him
said
halleck
quietly
i
lent
him
fifteen
hundred
in
the
spring
it
ought
to
make
him
quite
comfortable
for
the
oh
ben
why
did
you
lend
him
money
you
might
have
known
he
would
do
any
good
with
halleck
explained
how
and
why
the
loan
had
been
made
and
added
if
supporting
his
family
with
it
he
doing
some
good
i
lent
it
to
him
for
her
halleck
looked
hardily
into
his
sister
face
but
he
dropped
his
eyes
when
she
answered
simply
yes
of
course
but
i
do
believe
she
knows
anything
about
it
and
i
glad
of
it
it
would
only
add
to
her
trouble
she
worships
you
ben
does
she
she
seems
to
think
you
are
perfect
and
she
never
comes
here
but
she
asks
when
you
to
be
home
i
suppose
she
thinks
you
have
a
good
influence
on
that
miserable
husband
of
hers
he
going
from
bad
to
worse
i
guess
father
heard
that
he
is
betting
on
the
election
that
what
he
doing
with
your
it
would
be
somebody
else
money
if
it
was
mine
said
halleck
bartley
hubbard
must
live
and
he
must
have
the
little
excitements
that
make
life
poor
thing
sighed
olive
i
do
know
what
she
would
do
if
she
heard
that
you
were
going
away
to
hear
her
talk
you
would
think
she
had
been
counting
the
days
and
hours
till
you
got
back
it
ridiculous
the
way
she
goes
on
with
mother
asking
everything
about
you
as
if
she
expected
to
make
bartley
hubbard
over
again
on
your
pattern
i
should
hate
to
have
anybody
think
me
such
a
saint
as
she
does
you
but
there
is
much
danger
thank
goodness
i
could
laugh
sometimes
at
the
way
she
questions
us
all
about
you
and
is
so
delighted
when
she
finds
that
you
and
that
wretch
have
anything
in
common
but
it
all
too
miserably
sad
she
certainly
the
most
creature
alive
continued
olive
reflectively
sometimes
she
me
with
her
innocence
i
do
believe
that
even
her
jealousy
ever
suggested
a
wicked
idea
to
her
she
furious
because
she
feels
the
injustice
of
giving
so
much
more
than
he
does
she
has
really
a
thought
for
anybody
else
i
do
believe
that
if
she
were
free
to
choose
from
now
till
doomsday
she
would
always
choose
bartley
hubbard
bad
as
she
knows
him
to
be
and
if
she
were
a
widow
and
anybody
else
proposed
to
her
she
would
be
utterly
shocked
and
very
likely
said
halleck
absently
i
feel
very
unhappy
about
her
olive
resumed
i
know
that
she
anxious
and
troubled
all
the
time
you
do
something
ben
have
a
talk
with
that
disgusting
thing
and
see
if
you
ca
put
him
straight
again
somehow
no
exclaimed
halleck
bursting
violently
from
his
abstraction
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
let
him
go
his
own
way
and
the
sooner
he
goes
to
the
i
wo
interfere
i
ca
i
must
i
wonder
at
you
olive
he
pushed
away
from
the
table
and
went
limping
about
the
room
searching
here
and
there
for
his
hat
and
stick
which
were
on
the
desk
where
he
had
put
them
in
plain
view
as
he
laid
hand
on
them
at
last
he
met
his
astonished
eyes
if
i
interfered
i
should
not
interfere
because
i
cared
for
at
all
he
cried
of
course
not
said
olive
but
i
do
see
anything
to
make
you
at
me
about
it
would
be
because
i
cared
for
her
certainly
you
did
suppose
i
expected
you
to
interfere
from
any
other
motive
he
stood
looking
at
her
in
stupefaction
with
his
hand
on
his
hat
and
stick
like
a
man
who
doubts
whether
he
has
heard
aright
presently
a
shiver
passed
over
him
another
light
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
said
quietly
i
going
out
to
see
said
his
sister
accepting
provisionally
as
women
do
the
apparent
change
of
subject
do
go
ben
you
too
i
not
tired
i
intended
to
see
him
at
any
rate
i
want
to
talk
over
this
south
american
scheme
with
he
put
on
his
hat
and
moved
quickly
toward
the
door
ask
him
about
the
hubbards
said
olive
perhaps
he
can
tell
you
i
do
want
to
know
anything
i
shall
ask
him
she
slipped
between
him
and
the
door
ben
you
have
heard
anything
against
poor
marcia
have
you
no
you
do
think
she
to
blame
in
any
way
for
his
going
wrong
do
you
how
could
i
then
i
do
understand
why
you
wo
do
anything
to
help
he
looked
at
her
again
and
opened
his
lips
to
speak
once
but
closed
them
before
he
said
i
got
my
own
affairs
to
worry
me
is
that
reason
enough
for
not
interfering
in
theirs
not
for
you
then
i
do
choose
to
mix
myself
up
in
other
people
misery
i
like
it
as
you
once
but
you
ca
help
it
sometimes
as
i
can
this
time
olive
do
you
see
he
began
i
see
there
something
you
wo
tell
me
but
i
shall
find
it
she
threatened
him
half
playfully
i
wish
you
could
he
answered
then
perhaps
you
let
me
she
opened
the
door
for
him
now
and
as
he
passed
out
he
said
gently
i
tired
but
i
begin
to
rest
till
i
have
had
this
talk
with
atherton
i
had
better
yes
olive
assented
you
she
added
in
banter
altogether
too
mysterious
to
be
of
much
comfort
at
the
family
heard
him
close
the
outside
door
behind
him
after
olive
came
back
to
them
and
she
explained
he
gone
out
to
talk
it
over
with
his
father
gave
a
laugh
of
relief
well
if
he
leaves
it
to
atherton
i
guess
we
need
worry
about
the
child
is
at
all
well
said
his
mother
xxxiii
halleck
met
atherton
at
the
door
of
his
room
with
his
hat
and
coat
on
why
halleck
i
was
just
going
to
see
if
you
had
come
home
you
need
now
said
halleck
pushing
by
him
into
the
room
i
want
to
see
you
atherton
on
atherton
took
off
his
hat
and
closed
the
door
with
one
hand
while
he
slipped
the
other
arm
out
of
his
overcoat
sleeve
well
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
going
to
mingle
a
little
business
myself
with
the
pleasure
of
seeing
he
turned
up
the
gas
in
his
and
took
the
chair
from
which
he
had
looked
across
the
table
at
halleck
when
they
talked
there
before
it
the
old
subject
he
said
with
a
sense
of
repetition
in
the
situation
i
learn
from
witherby
that
hubbard
has
taken
that
money
of
yours
out
of
the
events
and
from
what
i
hear
elsewhere
he
is
making
ducks
and
drakes
of
it
on
election
bets
what
shall
you
do
about
it
nothing
said
halleck
oh
very
well
returned
atherton
with
the
effect
of
being
a
little
snubbed
but
resolved
to
take
his
snub
professionally
he
broke
out
however
in
friendly
exasperation
why
in
the
world
did
you
lend
the
fellow
that
money
halleck
lifted
his
brooding
eyes
and
fixed
them
half
pleadingly
half
defiantly
upon
his
friend
face
i
did
it
for
his
wife
yes
i
know
returned
atherton
i
remember
how
you
felt
i
share
your
feeling
but
i
respected
it
however
i
doubt
if
your
loan
was
a
benefit
to
either
of
them
it
probably
tempted
him
to
count
upon
money
that
he
had
earned
and
that
always
yes
halleck
replied
but
i
ca
say
that
so
far
as
he
concerned
i
very
sorry
i
do
suppose
it
would
do
her
any
good
if
i
forced
him
to
disgorge
any
balance
he
may
have
left
from
his
wagers
no
then
i
shall
let
him
the
subject
was
dismissed
and
atherton
waited
for
halleck
to
speak
of
the
business
on
which
he
had
come
but
halleck
only
played
with
the
paper
cutter
which
his
left
hand
had
found
on
the
table
near
him
and
with
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
seemed
lost
in
an
unhappy
reverie
i
hope
you
wo
accuse
yourself
of
doing
him
an
injury
said
atherton
at
last
with
a
smile
injury
demanded
halleck
quickly
what
injury
how
by
lending
him
that
oh
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
thinking
of
it
returned
halleck
impatiently
i
was
thinking
of
something
different
i
aware
of
disliking
the
man
so
much
that
i
should
be
willing
to
have
greater
harm
than
that
happen
to
him
the
greatest
for
what
i
know
though
i
do
know
after
all
that
it
would
be
harm
in
another
life
if
there
is
one
he
might
start
in
a
new
direction
but
that
is
imaginable
of
him
here
he
can
only
go
from
bad
to
worse
he
can
only
make
more
and
more
sorrow
and
shame
why
should
one
wish
him
dead
when
his
death
could
do
nothing
but
good
i
suppose
you
do
expect
me
to
answer
such
a
question
but
suppose
i
did
then
i
should
say
that
no
man
ever
wished
any
such
good
as
that
except
from
the
worst
motive
and
the
less
one
has
to
do
with
such
questions
even
as
abstractions
the
you
right
said
halleck
but
why
do
you
call
it
an
abstraction
because
in
your
case
nothing
else
is
i
told
you
i
was
willing
the
worst
should
happen
to
and
i
did
believe
halleck
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
wearily
i
wish
i
could
convince
somebody
of
my
wickedness
but
it
seems
to
be
useless
to
try
i
say
things
that
ought
to
raise
the
roof
both
to
you
here
and
to
olive
at
home
and
you
tell
me
you
do
believe
me
and
she
tells
me
that
hubbard
thinks
me
a
saint
i
suppose
now
that
if
i
took
you
by
the
and
informed
you
confidentially
that
i
had
stopped
long
enough
at
clover
street
to
put
bartley
hubbard
quietly
out
of
the
way
you
would
send
for
a
i
should
send
for
a
doctor
said
atherton
such
is
the
effect
of
character
and
yet
out
of
the
fulness
of
the
heart
the
mouth
speaketh
out
of
the
heart
proceed
all
those
unpleasant
things
enumerated
in
scripture
but
if
you
bottle
them
up
there
and
keep
your
label
fresh
it
all
that
required
of
you
by
your
at
least
what
an
amusing
thing
morality
would
be
if
it
were
not
otherwise
atherton
do
you
believe
that
such
a
man
as
christ
ever
lived
i
know
you
do
halleck
said
atherton
well
that
depends
upon
what
you
call
it
what
i
was
if
my
well
youth
is
i
i
do
but
if
i
poising
dubiously
on
the
momentary
present
between
the
past
and
future
am
i
i
afraid
i
do
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
a
fairish
sort
of
faith
i
know
that
if
christ
never
lived
on
earth
some
one
lived
who
imagined
him
and
that
one
must
have
been
a
god
the
historical
fact
ought
to
matter
christ
being
imagined
ca
you
see
what
a
comfort
what
a
rapture
it
must
have
been
to
all
these
poor
souls
to
come
into
such
a
presence
and
be
looked
through
and
through
the
relief
the
rest
the
complete
exposure
of
judgment
day
every
day
is
judgment
day
said
atherton
yes
i
know
your
doctrine
but
i
mean
the
last
day
we
ought
to
have
something
in
anticipation
of
it
here
in
our
social
system
character
is
a
superstition
a
wretched
fetish
once
a
year
would
be
too
often
to
seize
upon
sinners
whose
blameless
life
has
placed
them
above
suspicion
and
turn
them
inside
out
before
the
community
so
as
to
show
people
how
the
smoke
of
the
pit
had
been
quietly
blackening
their
interior
that
would
destroy
character
as
a
he
laughed
again
well
this
is
business
though
it
is
pleasure
either
exactly
what
i
came
for
was
to
ask
you
something
i
finished
at
the
law
school
and
i
just
ready
to
begin
here
in
the
office
with
you
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
time
for
me
to
give
up
the
law
wait
a
moment
he
said
arresting
in
atherton
an
impulse
to
speak
we
will
take
the
decent
surprise
the
friendly
demur
the
conscientious
scruple
for
granted
now
honestly
do
you
believe
got
the
making
of
a
lawyer
in
me
i
do
think
you
very
well
halleck
atherton
began
ah
a
lawyer
you
wo
give
me
a
direct
answer
i
will
if
you
wish
retorted
atherton
do
you
want
to
give
it
up
then
do
it
no
man
ever
prospered
in
it
yet
who
wanted
to
leave
it
and
now
since
it
come
to
this
i
tell
you
what
i
really
thought
all
along
i
thought
that
if
your
heart
was
really
set
on
the
law
you
would
overcome
your
natural
disadvantages
for
it
but
if
the
time
ever
came
when
you
were
tired
of
it
your
chance
was
lost
you
never
would
make
a
lawyer
the
question
is
whether
that
time
has
it
has
said
halleck
then
stop
here
and
now
you
wasted
two
years
time
but
you
ca
get
it
back
by
throwing
more
after
it
i
should
be
your
friend
i
be
an
honest
man
if
i
let
you
go
on
with
me
after
this
a
bad
lawyer
is
such
a
very
bad
thing
this
is
altogether
a
surprise
to
me
but
it
will
be
a
blow
to
your
father
he
added
with
a
questioning
look
at
halleck
after
a
moment
it
might
have
been
if
i
had
taken
the
precaution
to
deaden
the
place
by
a
heavier
blow
ah
you
spoken
to
him
already
yes
i
had
it
out
in
a
sneaking
hypothetical
way
but
i
could
see
that
so
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
it
was
enough
it
served
not
that
he
consented
to
the
other
thing
there
where
i
shall
need
your
help
atherton
i
tell
you
what
my
plan
he
stated
it
bluntly
at
first
and
then
went
over
the
ground
and
explained
it
fully
as
he
had
done
at
home
atherton
listened
without
permitting
any
sign
of
surprise
to
escape
him
but
he
listened
with
increasing
gravity
as
if
he
heard
something
not
expressed
in
halleck
slow
somewhat
nasal
monotone
and
at
the
end
he
said
i
approve
of
any
plan
that
will
take
you
away
for
a
while
yes
speak
to
your
father
about
if
you
think
you
need
any
conviction
i
could
use
arguments
to
bring
it
about
in
you
said
halleck
in
recognition
of
his
friend
ready
concurrence
no
i
do
need
any
arguments
to
convince
me
i
believe
returned
atherton
then
i
wish
you
say
something
to
bring
me
round
unless
argument
is
used
by
somebody
the
plan
always
produces
a
cold
chill
in
halleck
smiled
but
atherton
kept
a
sober
face
i
wish
my
spanish
american
was
here
what
makes
you
think
it
a
good
plan
why
should
i
disappoint
my
father
hopes
again
and
wring
my
mother
heart
by
proposing
to
leave
them
for
any
such
uncertain
good
as
this
scheme
promises
he
still
challenged
his
friend
with
a
jesting
air
but
a
deeper
and
stronger
feeling
of
some
sort
trembled
in
his
voice
atherton
would
not
reply
to
his
emotion
he
answered
with
obvious
evasion
it
a
good
cause
in
some
sort
the
best
sort
it
a
missionary
that
what
my
mother
said
to
and
the
change
will
be
good
for
your
that
what
i
said
to
my
mother
atherton
remained
silent
waiting
apparently
for
halleck
to
continue
or
to
end
the
matter
there
as
he
chose
it
was
some
moments
before
halleck
went
on
you
would
say
would
you
that
my
first
duty
was
to
my
own
undertakings
and
to
those
who
had
a
right
to
expect
their
fulfilment
from
me
you
would
say
that
it
was
an
enormity
to
tear
myself
away
from
the
affection
that
clings
to
me
in
that
home
of
mine
yonder
and
that
nothing
but
some
supreme
motive
could
justify
me
and
yet
you
pretend
to
be
satisfied
with
the
reasons
i
given
you
not
dealing
honestly
with
me
atherton
no
said
atherton
keeping
the
same
scrutiny
of
halleck
face
which
he
had
bent
upon
him
throughout
but
seeming
now
to
hear
his
thoughts
rather
than
his
words
i
knew
that
you
would
have
some
supreme
motive
and
if
i
have
pretended
to
approve
your
scheme
on
the
reasons
you
have
given
me
i
have
dealt
honestly
with
you
but
perhaps
a
little
dishonesty
is
the
best
thing
under
the
circumstances
you
have
told
me
your
real
motive
and
i
ca
ask
but
you
imagine
it
and
what
do
you
imagine
that
i
have
been
disappointed
in
love
that
i
have
been
rejected
that
the
girl
who
had
accepted
me
has
broken
her
engagement
something
of
that
sort
demanded
halleck
scornfully
atherton
did
not
answer
oh
how
far
you
are
from
the
truth
how
blest
and
proud
and
happy
i
should
be
if
it
were
the
truth
he
looked
into
his
friend
eyes
and
added
bitterly
you
not
curious
atherton
you
do
ask
me
what
my
trouble
really
is
do
you
wish
me
to
tell
you
what
it
is
without
asking
atherton
kept
turning
a
pencil
end
for
end
between
his
fingers
while
a
compassionate
smile
slightly
curved
his
lips
no
he
said
finally
i
think
you
had
better
not
tell
me
your
trouble
i
can
believe
very
well
without
knowing
it
that
it
serious
oh
tragic
said
halleck
but
i
doubt
if
it
would
help
you
to
tell
it
i
too
much
respect
for
your
good
sense
to
suppose
that
it
an
unreality
and
i
suspect
that
confession
would
only
weaken
you
if
you
told
me
you
would
feel
that
you
had
made
me
a
partner
in
your
responsibility
and
you
would
be
tempted
to
leave
the
struggle
to
me
if
you
battling
with
some
temptation
some
you
must
make
the
fight
alone
you
would
only
turn
to
an
ally
to
be
flattered
into
disbelief
of
your
danger
or
your
halleck
assented
with
a
slight
nod
to
each
point
that
the
lawyer
made
you
right
he
said
but
a
man
of
your
subtlety
ca
pretend
that
he
does
know
what
the
trouble
is
in
such
a
simple
case
as
i
do
know
anything
certainly
returned
atherton
and
as
far
as
i
can
i
refuse
to
imagine
anything
if
your
trouble
concerns
some
one
besides
yourself
and
no
great
trouble
can
concern
one
man
alone
you
no
right
to
tell
another
daniel
come
to
judgment
you
must
trust
to
your
principles
your
to
keep
you
right
halleck
burst
into
a
harsh
laugh
and
rose
from
his
chair
ah
there
you
abdicate
the
judicial
function
principles
against
do
you
suppose
i
was
approached
my
principles
and
why
the
devil
always
takes
a
man
on
the
very
highest
plane
he
knows
all
about
our
principles
and
and
what
they
made
of
how
the
noblest
and
purest
attributes
of
our
nature
with
which
we
trap
each
other
so
easily
must
amuse
him
pity
rectitude
moral
indignation
a
blameless
life
he
knows
that
they
all
instruments
for
him
no
sir
no
more
principles
and
for
me
i
had
enough
of
them
nothing
for
me
but
to
run
and
that
what
i
going
to
do
but
quite
right
about
the
other
thing
atherton
and
i
give
you
a
thanks
for
telling
me
that
my
trouble
is
mine
alone
and
i
no
right
to
confide
it
to
you
it
is
mine
in
the
sense
that
no
other
soul
is
defiled
with
the
knowledge
of
it
and
i
glad
you
saved
me
from
the
ghastly
profanation
the
sacrilege
of
telling
it
i
was
sneaking
round
for
your
sympathy
i
did
want
somehow
to
shift
the
responsibility
on
to
you
to
get
you
god
help
me
to
flatter
me
out
of
my
wholesome
fear
and
contempt
of
myself
well
that
past
now
and
good
night
he
abruptly
turned
away
from
atherton
and
swung
himself
on
his
cane
toward
the
door
atherton
took
up
his
hat
and
coat
i
walk
home
with
you
he
said
all
right
returned
halleck
listlessly
how
soon
shall
you
go
asked
the
lawyer
when
they
were
in
the
street
oh
there
a
ship
sailing
from
new
york
next
week
said
halleck
in
the
same
tone
of
weary
indifference
i
shall
go
in
they
talked
desultorily
of
other
things
when
they
came
to
the
foot
of
clover
street
halleck
plucked
his
hand
out
of
atherton
arm
i
going
up
through
here
he
said
with
sullen
obstinacy
better
not
returned
his
friend
quietly
will
it
hurt
her
if
i
stop
to
look
at
the
outside
of
the
house
where
she
lives
it
will
hurt
you
said
atherton
i
do
wish
to
spare
myself
retorted
halleck
he
shook
off
the
touch
that
atherton
had
laid
upon
his
shoulder
and
started
up
the
hill
the
other
overtook
him
and
like
a
man
who
has
attempted
to
rule
a
drunkard
by
thwarting
his
freak
and
then
hopes
to
accomplish
his
end
by
humoring
it
he
passed
his
arm
through
halleck
again
and
went
with
him
but
when
they
came
to
the
house
halleck
did
not
stop
he
did
not
even
look
at
it
but
atherton
felt
the
deep
shudder
that
passed
through
him
in
the
week
that
followed
they
met
daily
and
halleck
broken
pride
no
longer
stayed
him
from
the
shame
of
open
and
wavering
purpose
atherton
found
it
easier
to
persuade
the
clinging
reluctance
of
the
father
and
mother
than
to
keep
halleck
resolution
for
him
halleck
could
no
longer
keep
it
for
himself
not
much
like
the
behavior
of
people
we
read
of
in
similar
circumstances
he
said
once
never
falter
when
they
see
the
path
of
duty
they
push
forward
without
looking
to
either
hand
or
else
he
added
with
a
hollow
laugh
at
his
own
satire
they
turn
their
backs
on
it
like
men
well
he
grew
gaunt
and
visibly
feeble
in
this
struggle
the
two
men
changed
places
the
plan
for
halleck
flight
was
no
longer
his
own
but
atherton
and
when
he
did
not
rebel
against
it
he
only
passively
acquiesced
the
decent
pretence
of
ignorance
on
atherton
part
necessarily
disappeared
in
all
but
words
the
trouble
stood
openly
confessed
between
them
and
it
came
to
atherton
saying
in
one
of
halleck
lapses
of
purpose
from
which
it
had
required
all
the
other
strength
to
lift
him
do
come
to
me
any
more
halleck
with
the
hope
that
i
shall
somehow
justify
your
evil
against
your
good
i
pitied
you
at
first
but
i
blame
you
you
atrocious
said
halleck
with
a
puzzled
baffled
look
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
secretly
think
you
have
somehow
come
by
your
evil
virtuously
and
you
want
me
to
persuade
you
that
it
is
different
from
other
evils
of
exactly
the
same
kind
that
it
is
beautiful
and
sweet
and
pitiable
and
not
ugly
as
hell
and
bitter
as
death
to
be
torn
out
of
you
mercilessly
and
flung
from
you
with
abhorrence
well
i
tell
you
that
you
are
suffering
guiltily
for
no
man
suffers
innocently
from
such
a
cause
you
must
and
you
ca
go
too
soon
do
suppose
that
i
find
anything
noble
in
your
position
i
should
do
you
a
great
wrong
if
i
do
all
i
could
to
help
you
realize
that
you
in
disgrace
and
that
only
making
a
choice
of
shames
in
running
away
suppose
the
truth
was
known
suppose
that
those
who
hold
you
dear
could
be
persuaded
of
it
could
you
hold
up
your
head
do
i
hold
up
my
head
as
it
is
asked
halleck
did
you
ever
see
a
more
abject
dog
than
i
am
at
this
moment
your
wounds
are
faithful
atherton
but
perhaps
you
might
have
spared
me
this
last
stab
if
you
want
to
know
i
can
assure
you
that
i
do
feel
any
melodramatic
vainglory
i
know
that
i
running
away
because
i
beaten
but
no
other
man
can
know
the
battle
i
fought
do
you
suppose
i
know
how
hideous
this
thing
is
no
one
else
can
know
it
in
all
its
ugliness
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
you
are
right
he
said
when
he
could
find
his
voice
i
suffer
guiltily
i
must
have
known
it
when
i
seemed
to
be
suffering
for
pity
sake
i
knew
it
before
and
when
you
said
that
love
without
marriage
was
a
worse
hell
than
any
marriage
without
love
you
left
me
without
refuge
i
had
been
trying
not
to
face
the
truth
but
i
had
to
face
it
then
i
came
away
in
hell
and
i
have
lived
in
hell
ever
since
i
had
tried
to
think
it
was
a
crazy
fancy
and
put
it
on
my
failing
health
i
used
to
make
believe
that
some
morning
i
should
wake
and
find
the
illusion
gone
i
abhorred
it
from
the
beginning
as
i
do
now
it
has
been
torment
to
me
and
yet
somewhere
in
my
lost
soul
the
blackest
depth
i
dare
say
this
shame
has
been
so
sweet
it
is
so
sweet
the
one
sweetness
of
life
ah
he
dashed
the
weak
tears
from
his
eyes
and
rose
and
buttoned
his
coat
about
him
well
i
shall
go
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
come
back
though
you
need
mention
this
to
my
father
as
an
argument
for
my
going
when
you
talk
me
over
with
him
he
added
with
a
glimmer
of
his
wonted
irony
he
waited
a
moment
and
then
turned
upon
his
friend
in
sad
upbraiding
when
i
came
to
you
a
year
and
a
half
ago
after
i
had
taken
that
ruffian
home
drunk
to
her
why
did
you
warn
me
then
atherton
did
you
see
any
danger
atherton
hesitated
i
knew
that
with
your
habit
of
suffering
for
other
people
it
would
make
you
miserable
but
i
could
have
dreamed
this
would
come
of
it
but
you
never
been
out
of
your
own
keeping
for
a
moment
you
are
responsible
and
you
are
to
blame
if
you
are
suffering
now
and
can
find
no
safety
for
yourself
but
in
running
that
true
said
halleck
very
humbly
and
i
wo
trouble
you
any
more
i
ca
go
on
sinning
against
her
belief
in
me
here
and
live
i
shall
go
on
sinning
against
it
there
as
long
as
i
live
but
it
seems
to
me
the
harm
will
be
a
little
less
yes
i
will
but
the
night
before
he
went
he
came
to
atherton
lodging
to
tell
him
that
he
should
not
go
atherton
was
not
at
home
and
halleck
was
spared
this
last
dishonor
he
returned
to
his
father
house
through
the
rain
that
was
beginning
to
fall
lightly
and
as
he
let
himself
in
with
his
key
olive
voice
said
it
ben
and
at
the
same
time
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
with
a
nervous
warning
clutch
hush
come
in
here
she
drew
him
from
the
dimly
lighted
hall
into
the
little
near
the
door
the
gas
was
burning
brighter
there
and
in
the
light
he
saw
marcia
white
and
still
where
she
sat
holding
her
baby
in
her
arms
they
exchanged
no
greeting
it
was
apparent
that
her
being
there
transcended
all
usage
and
that
they
need
observe
none
ben
will
go
home
with
you
said
olive
soothingly
is
it
raining
she
asked
looking
at
her
brother
coat
i
will
get
my
she
left
them
a
moment
i
have
been
been
walking
walking
about
marcia
panted
it
has
got
so
dark
i
afraid
to
go
home
i
hate
to
take
you
from
them
the
last
halleck
answered
nothing
he
sat
staring
at
her
till
olive
came
back
with
the
and
an
umbrella
then
while
his
sister
was
putting
the
waterproof
over
marcia
shoulders
he
said
let
me
take
the
little
one
and
gathered
it
with
or
without
her
consent
from
her
arms
into
his
the
baby
was
sleeping
it
nestled
warmly
against
him
with
a
luxurious
quiver
under
the
shawl
that
olive
threw
round
it
you
can
carry
the
umbrella
he
said
to
marcia
they
walked
fast
when
they
got
out
into
the
rainy
dark
and
it
was
hard
to
shelter
halleck
as
he
limped
rapidly
on
marcia
ran
forward
once
to
see
if
her
baby
were
safely
kept
from
the
wet
and
found
that
halleck
had
its
little
face
pressed
close
between
his
neck
and
cheek
do
be
afraid
he
said
i
looking
out
for
his
voice
sounded
broken
and
strange
and
neither
of
them
spoke
again
till
they
came
in
sight
of
marcia
door
then
she
tried
to
stop
him
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
oh
i
afraid
afraid
to
go
in
she
pleaded
he
halted
and
they
stood
confronted
in
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
her
face
was
twisted
with
weeping
why
are
you
afraid
he
demanded
harshly
we
had
a
quarrel
and
i
i
ran
away
i
said
that
i
would
never
come
back
i
left
him
you
must
go
back
to
him
said
halleck
he
your
husband
he
pushed
on
again
saying
over
and
over
as
if
the
words
were
some
spell
in
which
he
found
safety
you
must
go
back
you
must
go
back
you
must
go
back
he
dragged
her
with
him
now
for
she
hung
helpless
on
his
arm
which
she
had
seized
and
moaned
to
herself
at
the
threshold
i
ca
go
in
she
broke
out
i
afraid
to
go
in
what
will
he
say
what
will
he
do
oh
come
in
with
me
you
are
good
and
then
i
shall
not
be
afraid
you
must
go
in
alone
no
man
can
be
your
refuge
from
your
husband
here
he
released
himself
and
kissing
the
warm
little
face
of
the
sleeping
child
he
pressed
it
into
her
arms
his
fingers
touched
hers
under
the
shawl
he
tore
his
hand
away
with
a
shiver
she
stood
a
moment
looking
at
the
closed
door
then
she
flung
it
open
and
pausing
as
if
to
gather
her
strength
vanished
into
the
brightness
within
he
turned
and
ran
crookedly
down
the
street
wavering
from
side
to
side
in
his
lameness
and
flinging
up
his
arms
to
save
himself
from
falling
as
he
ran
with
a
gesture
that
was
like
a
wild
and
hopeless
appeal
xxxiv
marcia
pushed
into
the
room
where
she
had
left
bartley
she
had
no
escape
from
her
fate
she
must
meet
it
whatever
it
was
the
room
was
empty
and
she
began
doggedly
to
search
the
house
for
him
up
stairs
and
down
carrying
the
child
with
her
she
would
not
have
been
afraid
now
to
call
him
but
she
had
no
voice
and
she
could
not
ask
the
servant
anything
when
she
looked
into
the
kitchen
she
saw
the
traces
of
the
meal
he
had
made
in
the
and
when
she
went
a
second
time
to
their
chamber
to
lay
the
little
girl
down
in
her
crib
she
saw
the
drawers
pulled
open
and
the
things
as
he
had
tossed
them
about
in
packing
his
bag
she
looked
at
the
clock
on
the
mantel
an
extravagance
of
bartley
for
which
she
had
scolded
him
and
it
was
only
half
past
eight
she
had
thought
it
must
be
midnight
she
sat
all
night
in
a
chair
beside
the
bed
in
the
morning
she
drowsed
and
dreamed
that
she
was
weeping
on
bartley
shoulder
and
he
was
joking
her
and
trying
to
comfort
her
as
he
used
to
do
when
they
were
first
married
but
it
was
the
little
girl
sitting
up
in
her
crib
and
crying
loudly
for
her
breakfast
she
put
on
the
child
a
pretty
frock
that
bartley
liked
and
when
she
had
dressed
her
own
tumbled
hair
she
went
down
stairs
feigning
to
herself
that
they
should
find
him
in
the
parlor
the
servant
was
setting
the
table
for
breakfast
and
the
little
one
ran
forward
baby
chair
mamma
chair
papa
chair
yes
answered
marcia
so
that
the
servant
might
hear
too
papa
will
soon
be
she
persuaded
herself
that
he
had
gone
as
before
for
the
night
and
in
this
pretence
she
talked
with
the
child
at
the
table
and
she
put
aside
some
of
the
breakfast
to
be
kept
warm
for
bartley
i
do
know
just
when
he
may
be
in
she
explained
to
the
girl
the
utterance
of
her
pretence
that
she
expected
him
encouraged
her
and
she
went
about
her
work
almost
cheerfully
at
dinner
she
said
mr
hubbard
must
have
been
called
away
somewhere
we
must
get
his
dinner
for
him
when
he
comes
the
things
dry
up
so
in
the
she
put
flavia
to
bed
early
and
then
trimmed
the
fire
and
made
the
parlor
cosey
against
bartley
coming
she
did
not
blame
him
for
staying
away
the
night
before
it
was
a
just
punishment
for
her
wickedness
and
she
should
tell
him
so
and
tell
him
that
she
knew
he
never
was
to
blame
for
anything
about
hannah
morrison
she
enacted
over
and
over
in
her
mind
the
scene
of
their
reconciliation
in
every
step
on
the
pavement
he
approached
the
door
at
last
all
the
steps
died
away
and
the
second
night
passed
her
head
was
light
and
her
brain
confused
with
loss
of
sleep
when
the
child
called
her
from
above
and
woke
her
out
of
her
morning
drowse
she
went
to
the
kitchen
and
begged
the
servant
to
give
the
little
one
its
breakfast
saying
that
she
was
sick
and
wanted
nothing
herself
she
did
not
say
anything
about
bartley
breakfast
and
she
would
not
think
anything
the
girl
took
the
child
into
the
kitchen
with
her
and
kept
it
there
all
day
olive
halleck
came
during
the
forenoon
and
marcia
told
her
that
bartley
had
been
unexpectedly
called
away
to
new
york
she
added
without
knowing
why
ben
sailed
from
there
said
olive
sadly
yes
assented
marcia
we
want
you
to
come
and
take
tea
with
us
this
evening
olive
began
oh
i
ca
marcia
broke
in
i
must
be
away
when
bartley
gets
the
thought
was
something
definite
in
the
sea
of
uncertainty
on
which
she
was
cast
away
she
never
afterwards
lost
her
hold
of
it
she
confirmed
herself
in
it
by
other
inventions
she
pretended
that
he
had
told
her
where
he
was
going
and
then
that
he
had
written
to
her
she
almost
believed
these
childish
fictions
as
she
uttered
them
at
the
same
time
in
all
her
longing
for
his
return
she
had
a
sickening
fear
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
keep
his
parting
threat
and
drive
her
away
she
did
not
know
how
he
could
do
it
but
this
was
what
she
feared
she
seldom
left
the
house
which
at
first
she
kept
neat
and
pretty
and
then
let
fall
into
slatternly
neglect
she
ceased
to
care
for
her
dress
or
the
child
the
time
came
when
it
seemed
as
if
she
could
scarcely
move
in
the
mystery
that
beset
her
life
and
she
yielded
to
a
deadly
lethargy
which
paralyzed
all
her
faculties
but
the
instinct
of
concealment
she
repelled
the
kindly
approaches
of
the
hallecks
sometimes
sending
word
to
the
door
when
they
came
that
she
was
sick
and
could
not
see
them
or
when
she
saw
any
of
them
repeating
those
hopeless
lies
concerning
bartley
whereabouts
and
her
expectations
of
his
return
for
the
time
she
was
safe
against
all
kindly
misgivings
but
there
were
some
of
bartley
creditors
who
grew
impatient
of
his
long
absence
and
refused
to
be
satisfied
with
her
fables
she
had
a
few
dollars
left
from
some
money
that
her
father
had
given
her
at
home
and
she
paid
these
all
out
upon
the
demand
of
the
afterwards
as
other
bills
were
pressed
she
could
only
answer
with
incoherent
promises
and
evasions
that
scarcely
served
for
the
moment
the
pursuit
of
these
people
dismayed
her
it
was
nothing
that
certain
of
them
refused
further
credit
she
would
have
known
both
for
herself
and
her
child
how
to
go
hungry
and
cold
but
there
was
one
of
them
who
threatened
her
with
the
law
if
she
did
not
pay
she
did
not
know
what
he
could
do
she
had
read
somewhere
that
people
who
did
not
pay
their
debts
were
imprisoned
and
if
that
disgrace
were
all
she
would
not
care
but
if
the
law
were
enforced
against
her
the
truth
would
come
out
she
would
be
put
to
shame
before
the
world
as
a
deserted
wife
and
this
when
bartley
had
deserted
her
the
pride
that
had
bidden
her
heart
break
in
secret
rather
than
suffer
this
shame
even
before
itself
was
baffled
her
one
blind
device
had
been
concealment
and
this
poor
refuge
was
possible
no
longer
if
all
were
not
to
know
some
one
must
know
the
law
with
which
she
had
been
threatened
might
be
instant
in
its
operation
she
could
not
tell
her
mind
wavered
from
fear
to
fear
even
while
the
man
stood
before
her
she
perceived
the
necessity
that
was
upon
her
and
when
he
left
her
she
would
not
allow
herself
a
moment
delay
she
reached
the
events
building
in
which
atherton
had
his
office
just
as
a
lady
drove
away
in
her
coupé
it
was
miss
kingsbury
who
made
a
point
of
transacting
all
business
matters
with
her
lawyer
at
his
office
and
of
keeping
her
social
relations
with
him
entirely
distinct
as
she
fancied
by
this
means
she
was
only
partially
successful
but
at
least
she
never
talked
business
with
him
at
her
house
and
doubtless
she
would
not
have
talked
anything
else
with
him
at
his
office
but
for
that
increasing
dependence
upon
him
in
everything
which
she
certainly
would
not
have
permitted
herself
if
she
had
realized
it
as
it
was
she
had
now
come
to
him
in
a
state
of
nervous
exaltation
which
was
not
she
had
been
greatly
shocked
by
ben
halleck
sudden
freak
she
had
sympathized
with
his
family
till
she
herself
felt
the
need
of
some
sort
of
condolence
and
she
had
promised
herself
this
consolation
from
atherton
habitual
serenity
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
he
received
her
with
what
she
considered
an
impatient
manner
and
did
not
seem
at
all
glad
to
see
her
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
be
glad
to
see
a
lady
calling
on
business
and
no
doubt
he
often
found
her
troublesome
but
he
had
never
shown
it
before
she
felt
like
crying
at
first
then
she
passed
through
an
epoch
of
resentment
and
then
through
a
period
of
compassion
for
him
she
ended
by
telling
him
with
dignified
severity
that
she
wanted
some
money
they
usually
made
some
jokes
about
her
destitution
when
she
came
upon
that
errand
he
looked
surprised
and
vexed
and
i
have
spent
what
you
gave
me
last
month
she
explained
then
you
wish
to
anticipate
the
interest
on
your
bonds
certainly
not
said
clara
rather
sharply
i
wish
to
have
the
interest
up
to
the
present
but
i
told
you
said
atherton
and
he
could
not
in
spite
of
himself
help
treating
her
somewhat
as
a
child
i
told
you
then
that
i
was
paying
you
the
interest
up
to
the
first
of
november
there
is
none
due
now
you
understand
that
no
i
did
understand
answered
clara
she
allowed
herself
to
add
it
is
very
strange
atherton
struggled
with
his
irritation
and
made
no
reply
i
ca
be
left
without
money
she
continued
what
am
i
to
do
without
it
she
demanded
with
an
air
of
unanswerable
argument
why
i
have
it
i
felt
that
i
ought
to
understand
you
fully
said
atherton
with
cold
politeness
it
only
necessary
to
know
what
sum
you
clara
flung
up
her
veil
and
confronted
him
with
an
excited
face
mr
atherton
i
do
wish
a
i
ca
it
and
you
know
that
my
principles
are
entirely
against
anticipating
atherton
from
stooping
over
his
table
pencil
in
hand
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
that
provoked
her
then
may
i
ask
what
you
wish
me
to
do
no
i
ca
instruct
you
my
affairs
are
in
your
hands
but
i
must
she
bit
her
lip
however
and
did
not
say
it
on
the
contrary
she
asked
rather
feebly
is
there
nothing
due
on
anything
i
went
over
it
with
you
last
month
said
atherton
patiently
and
explained
all
the
investments
i
could
sell
some
stocks
but
this
election
trouble
has
disordered
everything
and
i
should
have
to
sell
at
a
heavy
loss
there
are
your
mortgages
and
there
are
your
bonds
you
can
have
any
amount
of
money
you
want
but
you
will
have
to
borrow
and
that
you
know
i
wo
do
there
should
always
be
a
sum
of
money
in
the
bank
said
clara
decidedly
i
do
my
very
best
to
keep
a
sum
there
knowing
your
theory
but
your
practice
is
against
me
you
draw
too
many
checks
said
atherton
laughing
very
well
cried
the
lady
pulling
down
her
veil
then
i
to
have
nothing
you
wo
allow
yourself
to
have
anything
atherton
began
but
she
interrupted
him
haughtily
it
is
certainly
very
odd
that
my
affairs
should
be
in
such
a
state
that
i
ca
have
all
the
money
of
my
own
that
i
want
whenever
i
want
atherton
thin
face
paled
a
little
more
than
usual
i
shall
be
glad
to
resign
the
charge
of
your
affair
miss
and
i
shall
accept
your
resignation
cried
clara
magnificently
whenever
you
offer
she
swept
out
of
the
office
and
descended
to
her
coupé
like
an
incensed
goddess
she
drew
the
curtains
and
began
to
cry
at
her
door
she
bade
the
servant
deny
her
to
everybody
and
went
to
bed
where
she
was
visited
a
little
later
by
olive
halleck
whom
no
ban
excluded
clara
lavishly
confessed
her
sin
and
sorrow
why
i
there
more
than
half
to
sympathize
with
him
about
ben
i
do
need
any
money
just
yet
and
the
first
thing
i
knew
i
was
accusing
him
of
neglecting
my
interests
and
i
do
know
what
all
of
course
he
had
to
say
he
would
have
anything
more
to
do
with
them
and
i
should
have
despised
him
if
he
had
and
now
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
the
property
never
been
anything
but
misery
to
me
ever
since
i
had
it
and
i
always
knew
it
would
get
me
into
trouble
sooner
or
she
whirled
her
face
over
into
her
pillow
and
sobbed
but
i
suppose
it
would
ever
make
me
insult
and
outrage
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
and
the
truest
man
and
the
noblest
gentleman
oh
will
he
think
of
me
olive
remained
sadly
quiet
as
if
but
superficially
interested
in
these
transports
and
clara
lifted
her
face
again
to
say
in
her
handkerchief
it
a
shame
olive
to
burden
you
with
all
this
at
a
time
when
care
enough
of
your
oh
i
rather
glad
of
somebody
else
care
it
helps
to
take
my
mind
off
said
olive
then
what
would
you
do
asked
clara
tempted
by
the
apparent
sympathy
with
her
in
the
effect
of
her
naughtiness
you
might
make
a
party
for
him
clara
suggested
olive
with
irony
clara
gave
way
to
a
loud
burst
of
grief
oh
olive
halleck
i
suppose
you
could
be
so
cruel
olive
rose
impatiently
then
write
to
him
or
go
to
him
and
tell
him
that
you
ashamed
of
yourself
and
ask
him
to
take
your
property
back
never
cried
clara
who
had
listened
with
fascination
what
would
he
think
of
me
why
need
you
care
it
purely
a
matter
of
business
and
you
need
mind
what
he
of
course
admitted
clara
thoughtfully
he
will
naturally
despise
you
added
olive
but
i
suppose
he
does
that
clara
gave
her
friend
as
piercing
a
glance
as
her
soft
blue
eyes
could
emit
and
detecting
no
sign
of
jesting
in
olive
sober
face
she
answered
haughtily
i
do
see
what
right
atherton
has
to
despise
me
oh
no
he
must
admire
a
girl
who
has
behaved
to
him
as
you
clara
hauteur
collapsed
and
she
began
to
truckle
to
olive
if
he
were
a
business
man
i
should
mind
it
but
knowing
him
socially
as
i
do
and
as
a
friend
and
an
acquaintance
that
way
i
do
see
how
i
can
do
i
wonder
you
did
think
of
that
before
you
accused
him
of
fraud
and
peculation
and
all
those
i
accuse
him
of
fraud
and
peculation
cried
clara
indignantly
you
said
you
did
know
what
all
you
called
him
said
olive
with
her
hand
on
the
door
clara
followed
her
down
stairs
well
i
shall
never
do
it
in
the
world
she
said
with
reviving
hope
in
her
voice
oh
i
do
expect
you
to
go
to
him
this
morning
said
olive
dryly
that
would
be
a
little
her
friend
kissed
her
olive
halleck
you
the
strangest
girl
that
ever
was
i
do
believe
you
joke
at
the
point
of
death
but
i
glad
you
have
been
perfectly
frank
with
me
and
of
course
it
worth
worlds
to
know
that
you
think
i
behaved
horridly
and
ought
to
make
i
glad
you
value
my
opinion
clara
and
if
you
come
to
me
for
frankness
you
can
always
have
all
you
want
it
a
drug
in
the
market
with
she
meagrely
returned
clara
embrace
and
left
her
in
a
reverie
of
tactless
scheming
for
the
restoration
of
peace
with
atherton
marcia
came
in
upon
the
lawyer
before
he
had
thought
after
parting
with
miss
kingsbury
to
tell
the
clerk
in
the
outer
office
to
deny
him
but
she
was
too
full
of
her
own
trouble
to
see
the
reluctance
which
it
tasked
all
his
strength
to
quell
and
she
sank
into
the
nearest
chair
unbidden
at
sight
of
her
atherton
became
the
prey
of
one
of
those
fantastic
repulsions
in
which
men
visit
upon
women
the
blame
of
others
thoughts
about
them
he
censured
her
for
halleck
wrong
but
in
another
instant
he
recognized
his
cruelty
and
atoned
by
relenting
a
little
in
his
intolerance
of
her
presence
she
sat
gazing
at
him
with
a
face
of
blank
misery
to
which
he
could
not
refuse
the
charity
of
a
prompting
question
is
there
something
i
can
do
for
you
hubbard
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
she
had
a
folded
paper
in
her
hands
which
lay
helpless
in
her
lap
after
a
moment
she
resumed
in
a
hoarse
low
voice
they
have
all
begun
to
come
for
their
money
and
this
one
this
one
says
he
will
have
the
law
of
me
i
do
know
what
he
means
if
i
do
pay
marcia
could
not
know
how
hard
atherton
found
it
to
govern
the
professional
suspicion
which
sprung
up
at
the
question
of
money
but
he
overruled
his
suspicion
by
an
effort
that
was
another
relief
to
the
struggle
in
which
he
was
wrenching
his
mind
from
miss
kingsbury
outrageous
behavior
what
have
you
got
there
he
asked
gravely
and
not
unkindly
and
being
used
to
prompt
the
reluctance
of
lady
clients
he
put
out
his
hand
for
the
paper
she
held
it
was
the
bill
of
the
threatening
creditor
for
indefinitely
repeated
dozens
of
tivoli
beer
why
do
they
come
to
with
this
mr
hubbard
is
oh
yes
i
heard
when
do
you
expect
him
home
i
do
where
is
he
she
looked
at
him
piteously
without
speaking
atherton
stepped
to
his
door
and
gave
the
order
forgotten
before
then
he
closed
the
door
and
came
back
to
marcia
do
you
know
where
your
husband
is
hubbard
oh
he
will
come
back
he
leave
me
he
dead
i
know
dead
but
he
will
come
back
he
only
went
away
for
the
night
and
something
must
have
happened
to
the
whole
tragedy
of
her
life
for
the
past
fortnight
was
expressed
in
these
wild
and
inconsistent
words
she
had
not
been
able
to
reason
beyond
the
pathetic
absurdities
which
they
involved
they
had
the
effect
of
assertions
confirmed
in
the
belief
by
incessant
repetition
and
doubtless
she
had
said
them
to
herself
a
thousand
times
atherton
read
in
them
not
only
the
confession
of
her
despair
but
a
prayer
for
mercy
which
it
would
have
been
inhuman
to
deny
and
for
the
present
he
left
her
to
such
refuge
from
herself
as
she
had
found
in
them
he
said
quietly
you
had
better
give
me
that
paper
hubbard
and
took
the
bill
from
her
if
the
others
come
with
their
accounts
again
you
must
send
them
to
me
when
did
you
say
hubbard
left
home
the
night
after
the
election
said
marcia
and
he
did
say
how
long
he
should
be
gone
pursued
the
lawyer
in
the
feint
that
she
had
known
he
was
going
no
she
answered
he
took
some
things
with
him
perhaps
you
could
judge
how
long
he
meant
to
be
absent
from
the
preparation
he
made
i
never
looked
to
see
i
could
atherton
changed
the
line
of
his
inquiry
does
any
one
else
know
of
this
no
said
marcia
quickly
i
told
halleck
and
all
of
them
that
he
was
in
new
york
and
i
said
that
i
had
heard
from
him
i
came
to
you
because
you
were
a
lawyer
and
you
would
not
tell
what
i
told
yes
said
atherton
i
want
it
kept
a
secret
oh
do
you
think
he
dead
she
implored
no
returned
atherton
gravely
i
do
think
he
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
i
could
bear
it
better
if
i
knew
he
was
dead
if
he
is
dead
he
out
of
his
mind
he
out
of
his
mind
do
you
think
and
he
wandered
off
somewhere
she
besought
him
so
pitifully
to
agree
with
her
bending
forward
and
trying
to
read
the
thoughts
in
his
face
that
he
could
not
help
saying
a
gush
of
grateful
tears
blinded
her
but
she
choked
down
her
sobs
i
said
things
to
him
that
night
that
were
enough
to
drive
him
crazy
i
was
always
the
one
in
fault
but
he
was
always
the
one
to
make
up
first
and
he
never
would
have
gone
away
from
me
if
he
had
known
what
he
was
doing
but
he
will
come
back
i
know
he
will
she
said
rising
and
oh
you
say
anything
to
anybody
will
you
and
he
get
back
before
they
find
out
i
will
send
those
men
to
you
and
bartley
will
see
about
it
as
soon
as
he
comes
home
do
go
hubbard
said
the
lawyer
i
want
to
speak
with
you
a
little
she
dropped
again
in
her
chair
and
looked
at
him
inquiringly
have
you
written
to
your
father
about
this
oh
no
she
answered
quickly
with
an
effect
of
shrinking
back
into
herself
i
think
you
had
better
do
so
you
ca
tell
when
your
husband
will
return
and
you
ca
go
on
in
this
i
will
never
tell
she
replied
closing
her
lips
inexorably
the
lawyer
forbore
to
penetrate
the
family
trouble
he
divined
are
you
all
alone
in
the
house
he
asked
the
girl
is
there
and
the
that
wo
do
hubbard
said
atherton
with
a
compassionate
shake
of
the
head
you
ca
go
on
living
there
oh
yes
i
can
i
not
afraid
to
be
alone
she
returned
with
the
air
of
having
thought
of
this
but
he
may
be
absent
some
time
yet
urged
the
lawyer
he
may
be
absent
indefinitely
you
must
go
home
to
your
father
and
wait
for
him
i
ca
do
that
he
must
find
me
here
when
he
comes
she
answered
firmly
but
how
will
you
stay
pleaded
atherton
he
had
to
deal
with
an
unreasonable
creature
who
could
not
be
driven
and
he
must
plead
you
have
no
money
and
how
can
you
live
oh
replied
marcia
with
the
air
of
having
thought
of
this
too
i
will
take
atherton
smiled
at
the
hopeless
practicality
and
shook
his
head
but
he
did
not
oppose
her
directly
mrs
hubbard
he
said
earnestly
you
have
done
well
in
coming
to
me
but
let
me
convince
you
that
this
is
a
matter
which
ca
be
kept
it
must
be
known
before
you
can
begin
to
help
yourself
you
must
let
others
help
you
either
you
must
go
home
to
your
father
and
let
your
husband
find
you
there
he
must
find
me
here
in
our
own
then
you
must
tell
your
friends
here
that
you
do
know
where
he
is
nor
when
he
will
return
and
let
them
advise
together
as
to
what
can
be
done
you
must
tell
the
hallecks
i
will
tell
them
cried
marcia
let
me
go
i
can
starve
there
and
freeze
and
if
he
finds
me
dead
in
the
house
none
of
them
shall
have
the
right
to
blame
him
to
say
that
he
left
me
that
he
deserted
his
little
child
oh
oh
oh
oh
what
shall
i
do
the
hapless
creature
shook
with
the
sobs
that
overpowered
her
now
and
atherton
refrained
once
more
she
did
not
seem
ashamed
before
him
of
the
sorrows
which
he
felt
it
a
sacrilege
to
know
and
in
a
blind
instinctive
way
he
perceived
that
in
proportion
as
he
was
a
stranger
it
was
possible
for
her
to
bear
her
disgrace
in
his
presence
he
spoke
at
last
from
the
hint
he
found
in
this
fact
will
you
let
me
mention
the
matter
to
miss
kingsbury
she
looked
at
him
with
sad
intensity
in
the
eyes
as
if
trying
to
fathom
any
nether
thought
that
he
might
have
it
must
have
seemed
to
her
at
first
that
he
was
mocking
her
but
his
words
brought
her
the
only
relief
from
her
she
had
known
to
suffer
kindness
from
miss
kingsbury
would
be
in
some
sort
an
atonement
to
bartley
for
the
wrong
her
jealousy
had
done
him
it
would
be
for
his
sake
it
would
be
expiation
yes
tell
her
she
answered
with
a
promptness
whose
obscure
motive
was
not
illumined
by
the
flash
of
passionate
pride
with
which
she
added
i
shall
not
care
for
she
rose
again
and
atherton
did
not
detain
her
but
when
she
had
left
him
he
lost
no
time
in
writing
to
her
father
the
facts
of
the
case
as
her
visit
had
revealed
them
he
spoke
of
her
reluctance
to
have
her
situation
known
to
her
family
but
assured
the
squire
that
he
need
have
no
anxiety
about
her
for
the
present
he
promised
to
keep
him
fully
informed
in
regard
to
her
and
to
telegraph
the
first
news
of
hubbard
he
left
the
squire
to
form
his
own
conjectures
and
to
take
whatever
action
he
thought
best
for
his
own
part
he
had
no
question
that
hubbard
had
abandoned
his
wife
and
had
stolen
halleck
money
and
the
detectives
to
whom
he
went
were
clear
that
it
was
a
case
of
european
travel
xxxv
atherton
went
from
the
detectives
to
miss
kingsbury
and
boldly
resisted
the
interdict
at
her
door
sending
up
his
name
with
the
message
that
he
wished
to
see
her
immediately
on
business
she
kept
him
waiting
while
she
made
a
frightened
toilet
and
leaving
the
letter
to
him
which
she
had
begun
half
finished
on
her
desk
she
came
down
to
meet
him
in
a
flutter
of
despondent
conjecture
he
took
her
mechanically
yielded
hand
and
seated
himself
on
the
sofa
beside
her
i
sent
word
that
i
had
come
on
business
he
said
but
it
is
no
affair
of
yours
she
hardly
knew
whether
to
feel
relieved
or
disappointed
except
as
you
make
all
unhappy
people
affairs
your
oh
she
murmured
in
meek
protest
and
at
the
same
time
she
remotely
wondered
if
these
affairs
were
his
i
came
to
you
for
help
he
began
again
and
again
she
interrupted
him
in
deprecation
you
are
very
good
after
after
what
i
what
happened
i
she
put
up
her
fan
to
her
lips
and
turned
her
head
a
little
aside
of
course
i
shall
be
glad
to
help
you
in
anything
atherton
you
know
i
always
yes
and
that
gave
me
courage
to
come
to
you
even
after
the
way
in
which
we
parted
this
morning
i
knew
you
would
not
misunderstand
me
no
said
clara
softly
doing
her
best
to
understand
him
or
think
me
wanting
in
delicacy
oh
no
no
if
i
believed
that
we
need
not
have
any
embarrassment
in
meeting
in
behalf
of
the
poor
creature
who
came
to
see
me
just
after
you
left
me
the
fact
is
he
went
on
i
felt
a
little
freer
to
promise
your
interest
since
i
had
no
longer
any
business
relation
to
you
and
could
rely
on
your
kindness
like
like
any
yes
assented
clara
faintly
and
she
forbore
to
point
out
to
him
as
she
might
fitly
have
done
that
he
had
never
had
the
right
to
advise
or
direct
her
at
which
he
hinted
except
as
she
expressly
conferred
it
from
time
to
time
i
shall
be
only
too
glad
and
i
will
have
a
statement
of
your
affairs
drawn
up
and
sent
to
her
heart
sank
she
ceased
to
move
the
fan
which
she
had
been
slowly
waving
back
and
forth
before
her
face
i
was
going
to
set
about
it
this
morning
but
hubbard
visit
mrs
hubbard
cried
clara
and
a
little
air
of
pique
qualified
her
despair
yes
she
is
in
trouble
the
greatest
her
husband
has
deserted
atherton
clara
mind
was
now
far
away
from
any
concern
for
herself
the
woman
whose
husband
has
deserted
her
supremely
appeals
to
all
other
women
i
ca
believe
it
what
makes
you
think
so
what
she
concealed
rather
than
what
she
told
me
i
believe
answered
atherton
he
ran
over
the
main
points
of
their
interview
and
summed
up
his
own
conjectures
i
know
from
things
halleck
has
let
drop
that
they
always
lived
happily
together
hubbard
has
been
speculating
with
borrowed
money
and
he
in
debt
to
everybody
she
been
alone
in
her
house
for
a
fortnight
and
she
only
came
to
me
because
people
had
begun
to
press
her
for
money
she
been
pretending
to
the
hallecks
that
she
hears
from
her
husband
and
knows
where
he
oh
poor
poor
thing
said
clara
too
shocked
to
say
more
then
they
do
know
no
one
knows
but
ourselves
she
came
to
me
because
i
was
a
comparative
stranger
and
it
would
cost
her
less
to
confess
her
trouble
to
me
than
to
them
and
she
allowed
me
to
speak
to
you
for
very
much
the
same
but
i
know
she
dislikes
me
so
much
the
better
she
ca
doubt
your
goodness
oh
and
if
she
dislikes
you
she
can
keep
her
pride
better
with
clara
let
her
eyes
fall
and
fingered
the
edges
of
her
fan
there
was
reason
in
this
and
she
did
not
care
that
the
opportunity
of
usefulness
was
personally
unflattering
since
he
thought
her
capable
of
rising
above
the
fact
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
she
asked
lifting
her
eyes
docilely
to
his
you
must
find
some
one
to
stay
with
her
in
her
house
till
she
can
be
persuaded
to
leave
it
and
you
must
lend
her
some
money
till
her
father
can
come
to
her
or
write
to
her
i
just
written
to
him
and
i
told
her
to
send
all
her
bills
to
me
but
i
afraid
she
may
be
in
immediate
terrible
sighed
clara
to
whom
the
destitution
of
an
acquaintance
was
appalling
after
all
her
charitable
knowledge
of
want
and
suffering
of
course
we
must
lose
a
moment
she
added
but
she
lingered
in
her
corner
of
the
sofa
to
discuss
ways
and
means
with
him
and
to
fathom
that
sad
enjoyment
which
comfortable
people
find
in
the
contemplation
of
alien
sorrows
it
was
not
her
fault
if
she
felt
too
kindly
toward
the
disaster
that
had
brought
atherton
back
to
her
on
the
old
terms
or
if
she
arranged
her
plans
for
befriending
marcia
in
her
desolation
with
too
buoyant
a
cheerfulness
but
she
took
herself
to
task
for
the
radiant
smile
she
found
on
her
face
when
she
ran
up
stairs
and
looked
into
her
glass
to
see
how
she
looked
in
parting
with
atherton
she
said
to
herself
that
he
would
think
her
perfectly
heartless
she
decided
that
it
would
be
indecent
to
drive
to
marcia
under
the
circumstances
and
she
walked
though
with
all
the
time
this
gave
her
for
reflection
she
had
not
wholly
banished
this
smile
when
she
looked
into
marcia
eyes
but
she
found
herself
incapable
of
the
awkwardnesses
she
had
deliberated
and
fell
back
upon
the
native
motherliness
of
her
heart
into
which
she
took
marcia
with
sympathy
that
ignored
everything
but
her
need
of
help
and
pity
marcia
bruised
pride
was
broken
before
the
goodness
of
the
girl
she
had
hated
and
she
performed
her
sacrifice
to
bartley
injured
memory
not
with
the
haughty
which
she
intended
should
humiliate
miss
kingsbury
but
with
the
prostration
of
a
woman
spent
with
watching
and
fasting
and
despair
she
held
clara
away
for
a
moment
of
scrutiny
and
then
submitted
to
the
embrace
in
which
they
recognized
and
confessed
all
it
was
scarcely
necessary
for
clara
to
say
that
atherton
had
told
her
marcia
already
knew
that
and
clara
became
a
partisan
of
her
theory
of
bartley
absence
almost
without
an
effort
in
spite
of
the
facts
that
atherton
had
suggested
to
the
contrary
of
he
has
wandered
off
somewhere
and
at
soon
as
he
comes
to
his
senses
he
will
hurry
home
why
i
was
reading
of
such
a
case
only
the
other
day
the
case
of
a
minister
who
wandered
off
in
just
the
same
way
and
found
himself
out
in
western
new
york
somewhere
after
he
had
been
gone
three
bartley
wo
be
gone
three
months
protested
marcia
certainly
not
cried
clara
in
severe
then
she
talked
of
his
return
for
a
while
as
if
it
might
be
expected
any
moment
in
the
mean
time
she
added
you
must
stay
here
you
quite
right
about
that
too
but
you
must
stay
here
alone
he
be
quite
as
much
shocked
at
that
as
if
he
found
you
gone
when
he
came
back
i
going
to
ask
you
to
let
my
friend
miss
strong
stay
with
you
and
she
must
pay
her
board
and
you
must
let
me
lend
you
all
the
money
you
need
and
dear
clara
dropped
her
voice
to
a
lower
and
gentler
note
you
must
try
to
keep
this
from
your
friends
you
must
let
atherton
write
to
your
father
you
must
let
me
tell
the
hallecks
they
be
hurt
if
you
do
you
need
be
troubled
of
he
wandered
off
in
a
temporary
hallucination
and
nobody
will
think
she
adopted
the
fiction
of
bartley
aberration
with
so
much
fervor
that
she
even
silenced
atherton
injurious
theories
with
it
when
he
came
in
the
evening
to
learn
the
result
of
her
intervention
she
had
forgotten
or
she
ignored
the
facts
as
he
had
stated
them
in
the
morning
she
was
now
bartley
valiant
champion
as
well
as
the
tender
protector
of
marcia
she
was
the
equal
friend
of
the
whole
exemplary
hubbard
family
atherton
laughed
and
she
asked
what
he
was
laughing
at
oh
he
answered
at
something
ben
halleck
once
said
a
real
woman
can
make
righteousness
delicious
and
virtue
clara
reflected
i
do
know
whether
i
like
that
she
said
finally
no
said
atherton
why
not
she
was
serving
him
with
an
cup
of
tea
which
she
had
brought
into
the
and
in
putting
the
second
lump
of
sugar
into
his
saucer
she
paused
again
thoughtfully
holding
the
little
cube
in
the
tongs
she
was
rather
elaborately
dressed
for
so
simple
an
occasion
and
her
silken
train
coiled
itself
far
out
over
the
mossy
depth
of
the
moquette
carpet
the
pale
blue
satin
of
the
furniture
and
the
delicate
white
and
gold
of
the
decorations
became
her
wonderfully
i
ca
say
exactly
it
seems
depreciatory
somehow
as
a
generalization
but
a
man
might
say
it
of
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with
she
concluded
and
you
would
approve
of
a
man
saying
it
of
the
woman
his
friend
was
in
love
with
pursued
atherton
taking
his
cup
from
her
if
they
were
very
close
she
did
not
know
why
but
she
blushed
and
then
grew
a
little
pale
i
understand
what
you
mean
he
said
and
i
should
have
liked
the
speech
from
another
kind
of
man
but
halleck
innocence
characterized
he
stirred
his
tea
and
then
let
it
stand
untasted
in
his
abstraction
yes
he
is
good
sighed
clara
if
he
were
not
so
good
it
would
be
hard
to
forgive
him
for
disappointing
all
their
hopes
in
the
way
he
it
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
said
atherton
gravely
even
severely
i
know
you
advised
it
asserted
clara
but
it
a
great
blow
to
them
how
strange
that
hubbard
should
have
disappeared
the
last
night
ben
was
at
home
i
glad
that
he
got
away
without
knowing
anything
about
atherton
drank
off
his
tea
and
refused
a
second
cup
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
yes
so
am
i
he
said
i
glad
of
every
league
of
sea
he
puts
behind
he
rose
as
if
eager
to
leave
the
subject
clara
rose
too
with
the
patient
acquiescence
of
a
woman
and
took
his
hand
proffered
in
parting
they
had
certainly
talked
out
but
there
seemed
no
reason
why
he
should
go
he
held
her
hand
while
he
asked
how
shall
i
make
my
peace
with
you
my
peace
what
for
she
flushed
joyfully
i
was
the
one
in
he
looked
at
her
mystified
why
surely
did
repeat
remark
oh
she
cried
indignantly
withdrawing
her
hand
i
meant
it
does
matter
she
added
if
you
still
wish
to
resign
the
charge
of
my
affairs
of
course
i
must
submit
but
i
thought
i
thought
she
did
not
go
on
she
was
too
deeply
hurt
up
to
this
moment
she
had
imagined
that
she
had
befriended
marcia
and
taken
all
that
trouble
upon
herself
for
goodness
sake
but
now
she
was
ready
to
upbraid
him
for
ingratitude
in
not
seeing
that
she
had
done
it
for
his
sake
you
can
send
me
the
statement
and
then
and
then
i
do
know
what
i
do
do
you
mind
what
i
said
i
often
said
quite
as
much
before
and
you
know
that
i
mean
it
i
want
you
to
take
my
property
back
again
and
never
to
mind
anything
i
say
i
not
worth
her
intended
upbraiding
had
come
to
this
pitiful
effect
of
and
her
hand
somehow
was
in
his
again
do
take
it
back
if
i
do
that
said
atherton
gravely
i
must
make
my
conditions
and
now
they
sat
down
together
on
the
sofa
from
which
he
had
risen
i
ca
be
subjected
again
to
your
disappointments
he
arrested
with
a
motion
of
his
hand
the
profuse
expression
of
her
penitence
and
good
intentions
and
i
felt
for
a
long
time
that
this
was
no
attitude
for
your
attorney
you
ought
to
have
the
right
to
question
and
censure
but
i
confess
i
grant
you
this
i
allowed
myself
to
make
your
interests
too
much
my
own
in
everything
to
be
able
to
bear
it
i
thought
several
times
that
i
ought
to
give
up
the
trust
but
it
seemed
like
giving
up
so
much
more
that
i
never
had
the
courage
to
do
it
in
cold
blood
this
morning
you
gave
me
my
chance
to
do
it
in
hot
blood
and
if
i
resume
it
i
must
make
my
it
seemed
a
long
speech
to
clara
who
sometimes
thought
she
knew
whither
it
tended
and
sometimes
not
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
must
be
relieved
continued
atherton
of
the
sense
i
had
that
it
was
indelicate
in
me
to
keep
it
while
i
felt
as
i
grown
to
feel
towards
he
stopped
if
i
take
it
back
you
must
come
with
it
he
suddenly
concluded
the
inconsistency
of
accepting
these
conditions
ought
to
have
struck
a
woman
who
had
so
long
imagined
herself
the
chase
of
but
clara
apparently
found
nothing
alarming
in
the
demand
of
a
man
who
openly
acted
upon
his
knowledge
of
what
could
only
have
been
matter
of
conjecture
to
many
suitors
she
had
snubbed
she
found
nothing
incongruous
in
the
transaction
and
she
said
with
as
tremulous
breath
and
as
swift
a
pulse
as
if
the
question
had
been
solely
of
herself
i
accept
the
in
the
long
happy
talk
that
lasted
till
midnight
they
did
not
fail
to
recognize
that
but
for
their
common
pity
of
marcia
they
might
have
remained
estranged
and
they
were
decently
ashamed
of
their
bliss
when
they
thought
of
misery
like
hers
when
atherton
rose
to
bid
clara
good
night
marcia
was
still
watching
for
bartley
indulging
for
the
last
time
the
folly
of
waiting
for
him
as
if
she
definitely
expected
him
that
night
every
night
since
he
disappeared
she
had
kept
the
lights
burning
in
the
parlor
and
hall
and
drowsed
before
the
fire
till
the
dawn
drove
her
to
a
few
hours
of
sleep
in
bed
but
with
the
coming
of
the
stranger
who
was
to
be
her
companion
she
must
deny
herself
even
this
consolation
and
openly
accept
the
fact
that
she
no
longer
expected
bartley
at
any
given
time
she
bitterly
rebelled
at
the
loss
of
her
solitude
in
which
she
could
be
miserable
in
whatever
way
her
sorrow
prompted
and
the
pangs
with
which
she
had
submitted
to
miss
kingsbury
kindness
grew
sharper
hour
by
hour
till
she
maddened
in
a
frenzy
of
resentment
against
the
cruelty
of
her
expiation
she
longed
for
the
day
to
come
that
she
might
go
to
her
and
take
back
her
promises
and
her
submission
and
fling
her
insulting
in
her
face
she
said
to
herself
that
no
one
should
enter
her
door
again
till
bartley
opened
it
she
would
die
there
in
the
house
she
and
her
baby
and
as
she
stood
wringing
her
hands
and
moaning
over
the
sleeping
little
one
a
hideous
impulse
made
her
brain
reel
she
wished
to
look
if
bartley
had
left
his
pistol
in
its
place
a
cry
for
help
against
herself
broke
from
her
she
dropped
upon
her
knees
the
day
came
and
the
hope
and
strength
which
the
mere
light
so
strangely
brings
to
the
sick
in
spirit
as
well
as
the
sick
in
body
visited
marcia
she
abhorred
the
temptation
of
the
night
like
the
remembrance
of
a
wicked
dream
and
she
went
about
with
a
humble
and
grateful
prayer
to
something
to
some
one
in
her
heart
her
housewifely
pride
stirred
again
that
girl
should
not
think
she
was
a
slattern
and
miss
strong
when
she
preceded
her
small
trunk
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
found
the
parlor
and
the
which
she
was
to
have
swept
and
dusted
and
set
in
perfect
order
by
marcia
hands
she
had
worked
with
fury
and
kept
her
still
but
it
began
again
at
sight
of
the
girl
fortunately
the
conservatory
pupil
had
embraced
with
even
more
than
miss
kingsbury
ardor
the
theory
of
bartley
aberration
and
she
met
marcia
with
a
sympathy
in
her
voice
and
eyes
that
could
only
have
come
from
sincere
conviction
she
was
a
simple
country
thing
who
would
never
be
a
prima
donna
but
the
overflowing
sentimentality
which
enabled
her
to
accept
herself
at
the
estimate
of
her
enthusiastic
made
her
of
far
greater
comfort
to
marcia
than
the
sublimest
musical
genius
would
have
done
she
worshipped
the
heroine
of
so
tragic
a
fact
and
her
heart
began
to
go
out
to
her
in
honest
helpfulness
from
the
first
she
broke
in
upon
the
monotony
of
marcia
days
with
the
offices
and
interests
of
wholesome
commonplace
and
exorcised
the
ghostly
silence
with
her
first
stroke
on
the
piano
which
bartley
had
bought
on
the
instalment
plan
and
had
not
yet
paid
for
in
fine
life
adjusted
itself
with
marcia
to
the
new
conditions
as
it
does
with
women
less
wofully
widowed
by
death
who
promise
themselves
reunion
with
their
lost
in
another
world
and
suffer
through
the
first
weeks
and
days
in
the
hope
that
their
parting
will
be
for
but
days
or
weeks
and
then
gradually
submit
to
indefinite
delay
she
prophesied
bartley
return
and
fixed
it
in
her
own
mind
for
this
hour
and
that
now
in
the
morning
i
shall
wake
and
find
him
standing
by
the
bed
no
at
night
he
will
come
in
and
surprise
us
at
she
cheated
herself
with
increasing
faith
at
each
renewal
of
her
hopes
when
she
ceased
to
formulate
them
at
last
it
was
because
they
had
served
their
end
and
left
her
established
if
not
comforted
in
the
superstition
by
which
she
lived
his
return
at
any
hour
or
any
moment
was
the
fetish
which
she
let
no
misgiving
blaspheme
everything
in
her
of
woman
and
of
wife
consecrated
it
she
kept
the
child
in
continual
remembrance
of
him
by
talking
of
him
and
by
making
her
recognize
the
photographs
in
which
bartley
had
abundantly
perpetuated
himself
at
night
when
she
folded
the
little
one
hands
for
prayer
she
made
her
pray
god
to
take
care
of
poor
papa
and
send
him
home
soon
to
mamma
she
was
beginning
to
canonize
him
her
father
came
to
see
her
as
soon
as
he
thought
it
best
after
letter
and
the
old
man
had
to
endure
talk
of
bartley
to
which
all
her
former
praises
were
as
refreshing
shadows
of
defamation
she
required
him
to
agree
with
everything
she
said
and
he
could
not
refuse
she
reproached
him
for
being
with
herself
the
cause
of
all
bartley
errors
and
he
had
to
bear
it
without
protest
at
the
end
he
could
say
nothing
but
better
come
home
with
me
marcia
and
he
suffered
in
meekness
the
indignation
with
which
she
rebuked
him
i
will
stay
in
bartley
house
till
he
comes
back
to
me
if
he
is
dead
i
will
die
the
old
man
had
satisfied
himself
that
bartley
had
absconded
in
his
own
rascally
right
mind
and
he
accepted
with
tacit
grimness
the
theory
of
the
detectives
that
he
had
not
gone
to
europe
alone
he
paid
back
the
money
which
bartley
had
borrowed
from
halleck
and
he
set
himself
as
patiently
as
he
could
to
bear
with
marcia
obstinacy
it
was
a
mania
which
must
be
indulged
for
the
time
and
he
could
only
trust
to
atherton
to
keep
him
advised
concerning
her
when
he
offered
her
money
at
parting
she
hesitated
but
she
finally
took
it
saying
bartley
will
pay
it
back
every
cent
as
soon
as
he
gets
home
and
if
she
added
he
does
get
back
soon
i
will
take
some
other
boarders
and
pay
it
he
could
see
that
she
was
offended
with
him
for
asking
her
to
go
home
but
she
was
his
girl
he
only
pitied
her
he
shook
hands
with
her
as
usual
and
kissed
her
with
the
old
stoicism
but
his
lips
set
to
fierceness
by
the
habit
of
sarcasm
trembled
as
he
turned
away
she
was
eager
to
have
him
go
for
she
had
given
him
miss
strong
room
and
had
taken
the
girl
into
her
own
and
bartley
would
not
like
it
if
he
came
back
and
found
her
there
bartley
disappearance
was
scarcely
a
day
wonder
with
people
outside
his
own
circle
in
that
time
of
anxiety
for
a
fair
count
in
louisiana
and
florida
and
long
before
the
returning
boards
had
partially
relieved
the
tension
of
the
public
mind
by
their
decision
he
had
quite
dropped
out
of
it
the
reporters
who
called
at
his
house
to
get
the
bottom
facts
in
the
case
adopted
marcia
theory
given
them
by
miss
strong
and
whatever
were
their
own
suspicions
or
convictions
paragraphed
him
with
merciful
brevity
as
having
probably
wandered
away
during
a
temporary
hallucination
they
spoke
of
the
depression
of
spirits
which
many
of
his
friends
had
observed
in
him
and
of
pecuniary
losses
as
the
cause
they
mentioned
his
possible
suicide
only
to
give
the
report
the
authoritative
denial
of
his
family
and
they
added
that
the
case
was
in
the
hands
of
the
detectives
who
believed
themselves
in
possession
of
important
clews
the
detectives
in
fact
remained
constant
to
their
original
theory
that
bartley
had
gone
to
europe
and
they
were
able
to
name
with
reasonable
confidence
the
person
with
whom
he
had
eloped
but
these
were
matters
hushed
up
among
the
force
and
the
press
in
the
mean
time
bartley
had
been
simultaneously
seen
at
montreal
and
cincinnati
at
about
the
same
time
that
an
old
friend
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
on
a
train
bound
westward
from
chicago
so
far
as
the
world
was
concerned
the
surmise
with
which
marcia
saved
herself
from
final
despair
was
the
only
impression
that
even
vaguely
remained
of
the
affair
her
friends
who
had
compassionately
acquiesced
in
it
at
first
waited
for
the
moment
when
they
could
urge
her
to
relinquish
it
and
go
home
to
her
father
but
while
they
waited
she
gathered
strength
to
establish
herself
immovably
in
it
and
to
shape
her
life
more
and
more
closely
about
it
she
had
no
idea
no
instinct
but
to
stay
where
he
had
left
her
till
he
came
back
she
opposed
this
singly
and
solely
against
all
remonstrance
and
treated
every
suggestion
to
the
contrary
as
an
instigation
to
crime
her
father
came
from
time
to
time
during
the
winter
to
see
her
but
she
would
never
go
home
with
him
even
for
a
day
she
put
her
plan
in
force
she
took
other
boarders
other
girl
students
like
miss
strong
whom
her
friends
brought
her
when
they
found
that
it
was
useless
to
oppose
her
and
so
began
to
abet
her
she
worked
hard
and
she
actually
supported
herself
at
last
in
a
frugal
independence
her
father
consulted
with
atherton
and
the
hallecks
he
saw
that
she
was
with
good
and
faithful
friends
and
he
submitted
to
what
he
could
not
help
when
the
summer
came
he
made
a
last
attempt
to
induce
her
to
go
home
with
him
he
told
her
that
her
mother
wished
to
see
her
she
would
not
understand
i
come
she
said
if
mother
gets
seriously
sick
but
i
ca
go
home
for
the
summer
if
i
had
been
at
home
last
summer
would
never
have
got
into
that
way
and
would
never
have
she
went
home
at
last
in
obedience
to
a
peremptory
summons
but
her
mother
was
too
far
gone
to
know
her
when
she
came
her
quiet
narrow
life
had
grown
colder
and
more
inward
to
the
end
and
it
passed
without
any
apparent
revival
of
tenderness
for
those
once
dear
to
her
the
funeral
publicity
that
followed
seemed
a
final
touch
of
the
fate
by
which
all
her
preferences
had
been
thwarted
in
the
world
marcia
stayed
only
till
she
could
put
the
house
in
order
after
they
had
laid
her
mother
to
rest
among
the
early
reddening
sumacs
under
the
hot
glare
of
the
august
sun
and
when
she
came
away
she
brought
her
father
with
her
to
boston
where
he
spent
his
days
as
he
might
taking
long
and
aimless
walks
devouring
heaps
of
newspapers
rusting
in
idleness
and
aging
fast
as
men
do
in
the
irksomeness
of
disuse
halleck
father
was
beginning
to
show
his
age
too
and
halleck
mother
lived
only
in
her
thoughts
of
him
and
her
hopes
of
his
return
but
he
did
not
even
speak
of
this
in
his
letters
to
them
he
said
very
little
of
himself
and
they
could
merely
infer
that
the
experiment
to
which
he
had
devoted
himself
was
becoming
less
and
less
satisfactory
their
sense
of
this
added
its
pang
to
their
unhappiness
in
his
absence
one
day
marcia
said
to
olive
halleck
has
any
one
noticed
that
you
are
beginning
to
look
like
your
sisters
noticed
it
answered
the
girl
i
always
an
old
maid
and
now
i
beginning
to
show
marcia
wondered
if
she
had
not
hurt
olive
feelings
but
she
would
never
have
known
how
to
excuse
herself
and
latterly
she
had
been
growing
more
and
more
like
her
father
in
certain
traits
perhaps
her
passion
for
bartley
had
been
the
one
spring
of
tenderness
in
her
nature
and
if
ever
it
were
spent
she
would
stiffen
into
the
old
man
stern
aridity
xxxvi
it
was
nearly
two
years
after
atherton
marriage
that
halleck
one
day
opened
the
door
of
the
lawyer
private
office
and
turning
the
key
in
the
lock
limped
forward
to
where
the
latter
was
sitting
at
his
desk
halleck
was
greatly
changed
the
full
beard
that
he
had
grown
scarcely
hid
the
savage
gauntness
of
his
face
but
the
change
was
not
so
much
in
lines
and
contours
as
in
that
expression
of
qualities
which
we
call
looks
well
atherton
halleck
the
friends
looked
at
each
other
and
atherton
finally
broke
from
his
amaze
and
offered
his
hand
with
an
effect
even
then
of
making
conditions
but
it
was
halleck
who
was
the
first
to
speak
again
how
she
is
she
well
is
she
still
here
have
they
heard
anything
from
him
yet
no
said
atherton
answering
the
last
question
with
the
same
provisional
effect
as
before
then
he
is
that
what
i
knew
that
what
i
and
here
i
am
the
fight
is
over
and
that
the
end
of
it
i
you
look
it
said
atherton
sadly
oh
yes
i
look
it
that
the
reason
i
can
afford
to
be
frank
in
coming
back
to
my
friends
i
knew
that
with
this
look
in
my
face
i
should
make
my
own
welcome
and
it
cordial
even
beyond
my
i
not
glad
to
see
you
halleck
said
atherton
for
your
own
sake
i
wish
you
were
at
the
other
end
of
the
oh
i
know
that
how
are
my
people
have
you
seen
my
father
lately
or
my
mother
or
olive
a
pathetic
tremor
shook
his
voice
why
have
seen
them
yet
demanded
atherton
halleck
laughed
cynically
my
dear
friend
my
steamer
arrived
this
morning
and
i
just
off
the
new
york
train
i
hurried
to
your
office
in
all
the
impatience
of
friendship
i
very
lucky
to
find
you
here
so
late
in
the
day
you
can
take
me
home
to
dinner
and
let
your
domestic
happiness
preach
to
me
come
i
rather
like
the
notion
of
that
halleck
said
atherton
without
heeding
his
banter
i
wish
you
would
go
away
again
no
one
knows
you
are
here
you
say
and
no
one
need
ever
know
halleck
set
his
lips
and
shook
his
head
with
a
mocking
smile
surprised
at
you
atherton
with
your
knowledge
of
human
nature
come
to
stay
you
must
know
that
you
must
know
that
i
had
gone
through
everything
before
i
gave
up
and
that
i
have
the
strength
to
begin
the
struggle
over
again
i
tell
you
i
beaten
and
i
glad
of
it
for
there
is
rest
in
it
you
would
waste
your
breath
if
you
talked
to
me
in
the
old
way
there
nothing
in
me
to
appeal
to
any
more
if
i
was
wrong
but
i
do
admit
any
more
that
i
was
wrong
by
heaven
i
was
you
beaten
halleck
said
atherton
sorrowfully
he
pushed
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
clasped
his
hands
together
behind
his
head
as
his
habit
was
in
reasoning
with
obstinate
clients
what
do
you
propose
to
do
i
propose
to
what
for
what
for
till
i
can
prove
that
he
is
and
then
then
i
shall
be
free
to
ask
he
added
angrily
you
know
what
come
back
for
why
do
you
torment
me
with
these
questions
i
did
what
i
could
i
ran
away
and
the
last
night
i
saw
her
i
thrust
her
back
into
that
hell
she
called
her
home
and
i
told
her
that
no
man
could
be
her
refuge
from
that
devil
her
husband
when
she
had
begged
me
in
her
mortal
terror
to
go
in
with
her
and
save
her
from
him
was
the
recollection
i
had
to
comfort
me
when
i
tried
to
put
her
out
of
my
mind
out
of
my
soul
when
i
heard
that
he
was
gone
i
respected
her
days
of
mourning
god
knows
how
i
endured
it
now
it
over
but
i
did
endure
it
i
waited
and
here
i
am
and
you
ask
me
to
go
away
again
ah
he
fetched
his
breath
through
his
set
teeth
and
struck
his
fist
on
his
knee
he
is
and
now
if
she
will
she
can
marry
me
do
look
at
me
as
if
i
had
killed
him
there
has
been
a
time
in
these
two
infernal
years
when
i
would
have
given
my
life
to
save
his
for
sake
i
know
that
and
that
gives
me
courage
it
gives
me
but
if
he
is
dead
then
he
has
abandoned
her
and
she
has
the
right
to
be
free
she
can
get
a
divorce
oh
said
atherton
compassionately
has
that
poison
got
into
you
halleck
you
might
ask
her
if
she
were
a
widow
to
marry
you
but
how
will
you
ask
her
if
she
still
a
wife
to
get
a
divorce
and
then
marry
you
how
will
you
suggest
that
to
a
woman
whose
constancy
to
her
mistake
has
made
her
sacred
to
you
halleck
seemed
about
to
answer
but
he
only
panted
and
and
atherton
continued
you
would
have
to
corrupt
her
soul
first
i
do
know
what
change
you
made
in
yourself
during
these
two
years
you
look
like
a
desperate
and
defeated
man
but
you
do
look
like
you
do
like
one
of
those
scoundrels
who
lure
women
from
their
duty
ruin
homes
and
destroy
society
not
in
the
old
libertine
fashion
in
which
the
seducer
had
at
least
the
grace
to
risk
his
life
but
safely
smoothly
under
the
shelter
of
our
infamous
laws
have
you
really
come
back
here
to
give
your
father
honest
name
and
the
example
of
a
man
of
your
own
blameless
life
in
support
of
conditions
that
tempt
people
to
marry
with
a
mental
reservation
and
that
weaken
every
marriage
bond
with
the
guilty
hope
of
escape
whenever
a
fickle
mind
or
secret
lust
or
wicked
will
may
dictate
have
you
come
to
join
yourself
to
those
miserable
spectres
who
go
shrinking
through
the
world
afraid
of
their
own
past
and
anxious
to
hide
it
from
those
they
hold
dear
or
do
you
propose
to
defy
the
world
to
help
form
within
it
the
community
of
outcasts
with
whom
shame
is
not
shame
nor
dishonor
dishonor
how
will
you
like
the
society
of
those
uncertain
men
those
certain
women
you
are
very
eloquent
said
halleck
but
i
ask
you
to
observe
that
these
little
abstractions
do
interest
me
i
a
concrete
purpose
and
i
ca
contemplate
the
effect
of
other
people
actions
upon
american
civilization
when
you
ask
me
to
believe
that
i
ought
to
try
to
rescue
a
woman
from
the
misery
to
which
a
villain
has
left
her
simply
because
some
justice
of
the
peace
consecrated
his
power
over
her
i
decline
to
be
such
a
fool
i
use
my
reason
and
i
see
who
it
was
that
defiled
and
destroyed
that
marriage
and
i
know
that
she
is
as
free
in
the
sight
of
god
as
if
he
had
never
lived
if
the
world
does
like
my
open
shame
let
it
look
to
its
own
secret
shame
the
marriages
made
and
maintained
from
interest
and
ambition
and
vanity
and
folly
i
will
take
my
chance
with
the
men
and
women
who
have
been
honest
enough
to
own
their
mistake
and
to
try
to
repair
it
and
i
will
preach
by
my
life
that
marriage
has
no
sanctity
but
what
love
gives
it
and
that
when
love
ceases
marriage
ceases
before
heaven
if
the
laws
have
come
to
recognize
that
by
whatever
fiction
so
much
the
better
for
the
laws
halleck
rose
well
then
cried
atherton
rising
too
you
shall
meet
me
on
your
own
ground
this
poor
creature
is
constant
in
every
breath
she
draws
to
the
ruffian
who
has
abandoned
her
i
must
believe
since
you
say
it
that
you
are
ready
to
abet
her
in
getting
a
divorce
even
one
of
those
divorces
that
are
without
publicity
and
for
any
cause
halleck
winced
that
you
are
willing
to
put
your
sisters
to
shame
before
the
world
to
break
your
mother
heart
and
your
father
pride
to
insult
the
ideal
of
goodness
that
she
herself
has
formed
of
you
but
how
will
you
begin
the
love
on
her
part
at
least
has
ceased
has
the
marriage
she
shall
tell
me
answered
halleck
he
left
atherton
without
another
word
and
in
resentment
that
effaced
all
friendship
between
them
though
after
this
parting
they
still
kept
up
its
outward
forms
and
the
athertons
took
part
in
the
rejoicings
with
which
the
hallecks
celebrated
return
his
meeting
with
the
lawyer
was
the
renewal
of
the
old
conflict
on
terms
of
novel
and
hopeless
degradation
he
had
mistaken
for
peace
that
exhaustion
of
spirit
which
comes
to
a
man
in
battling
with
his
conscience
he
had
fancied
his
struggle
over
and
he
was
to
learn
now
that
its
anguish
had
just
begun
in
that
delusion
his
love
was
to
have
been
a
law
to
itself
able
to
loose
and
to
bind
and
potent
to
beat
down
all
regrets
all
doubts
all
fears
that
questioned
it
but
the
words
with
which
marcia
met
him
struck
his
passion
dumb
oh
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
lack
she
said
now
i
know
that
we
can
find
him
you
were
such
friends
with
him
and
you
understood
him
so
well
that
you
will
know
just
what
to
do
yes
we
shall
find
him
now
and
we
should
have
found
him
long
ago
if
you
had
been
here
oh
if
you
had
never
gone
away
but
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
for
what
you
said
to
me
that
night
when
you
would
not
come
in
with
me
the
words
have
rung
in
my
ears
ever
since
they
showed
that
you
had
faith
in
him
more
faith
than
i
had
and
i
made
them
my
rule
and
my
guide
no
one
has
been
my
refuge
from
him
and
no
one
ever
shall
be
and
i
thank
you
yes
i
thank
you
on
my
bended
knees
for
making
me
go
into
the
house
alone
it
my
one
comfort
that
i
had
the
strength
to
come
back
to
him
and
let
him
do
anything
he
would
to
me
after
i
had
treated
him
so
but
i
never
pretended
it
was
my
own
strength
i
have
always
told
everybody
that
the
strength
came
from
you
halleck
had
brought
olive
with
him
she
and
marcia
father
listened
to
these
words
with
the
patience
of
people
who
had
heard
them
many
times
before
but
at
the
end
olive
glanced
at
halleck
downcast
face
with
fond
pride
in
the
satisfaction
she
imagined
they
must
give
him
the
old
man
ruminated
upon
a
bit
of
broom
straw
and
absently
let
the
little
girl
catch
by
his
hands
as
she
ran
to
and
fro
between
him
and
her
mother
while
her
mother
talked
halleck
made
a
formless
sound
in
his
throat
for
answer
and
marcia
went
on
i
got
a
new
plan
now
but
it
seems
as
if
father
took
a
pleasure
in
discouraging
my
plans
i
that
bartley
shut
up
somewhere
in
some
asylum
and
i
want
them
to
send
detectives
to
all
the
asylums
in
the
united
states
and
in
canada
you
ca
tell
how
far
off
he
would
wander
in
that
state
and
inquire
if
any
stray
insane
person
has
been
brought
to
them
does
it
seem
to
you
as
if
that
would
be
the
right
way
to
find
him
i
want
to
talk
it
all
over
with
you
halleck
for
i
know
can
sympathize
with
me
and
if
need
be
i
will
go
to
the
asylums
myself
i
will
walk
to
them
i
will
crawl
to
them
on
my
knees
when
i
think
of
him
shut
up
there
among
those
raving
maniacs
and
used
as
they
use
people
in
some
of
the
asylums
oh
oh
oh
oh
she
broke
out
into
sobs
and
caught
her
little
girl
to
her
breast
the
child
must
have
been
accustomed
to
her
mother
tears
she
twisted
her
head
round
and
looked
at
halleck
with
a
laughing
face
marcia
dried
her
eyes
and
asked
with
quivering
lips
is
she
like
him
yes
replied
halleck
huskily
she
has
his
long
eyelashes
exactly
and
his
hair
and
complexion
she
the
old
man
sat
chewing
his
broom
straw
in
silence
but
when
marcia
left
the
room
to
get
bartley
photograph
so
that
halleck
might
see
the
resemblance
to
him
her
father
looked
at
halleck
from
under
his
beetling
brows
i
do
think
we
need
trouble
the
much
for
bartley
hubbard
but
if
it
was
to
search
the
states
prisons
and
the
jails
the
and
the
or
if
it
was
to
dig
up
the
scoundrels
who
have
been
hung
under
assumed
names
during
the
last
two
years
i
should
have
some
hopes
of
identifying
marcia
came
back
and
the
old
man
sat
in
quiet
as
if
he
had
never
spoken
it
was
clear
that
whatever
hate
he
felt
for
bartley
he
spared
her
and
that
if
he
discouraged
her
plans
as
she
said
it
was
because
they
were
infected
by
the
craze
in
which
she
canonized
bartley
you
see
how
she
is
said
olive
when
they
came
away
yes
yes
yes
halleck
desolately
assented
sometimes
she
seems
to
me
just
like
a
querulous
vulgar
woman
in
her
talk
she
repeats
herself
in
the
same
scolding
sort
of
way
and
she
so
eager
to
blame
somebody
besides
bartley
for
bartley
wickedness
that
when
she
ca
punish
herself
she
punishes
her
father
merciless
to
that
wretched
old
man
and
he
wearing
his
homesick
life
out
here
in
the
city
for
her
sake
you
heard
her
just
now
about
his
discouraging
her
plans
yes
said
halleck
as
before
she
grown
commoner
and
narrower
but
it
hardly
her
fault
poor
thing
and
it
seems
terribly
unjust
that
she
should
be
made
so
by
what
she
has
suffered
but
that
just
the
way
it
has
happened
she
so
undisciplined
that
she
could
get
any
good
out
of
her
misfortunes
she
only
got
harm
they
made
her
selfish
and
there
seems
to
be
nothing
left
of
what
she
was
two
years
ago
but
her
devotion
to
that
miserable
wretch
you
let
it
turn
you
against
her
ben
you
must
forget
what
she
might
have
been
she
had
a
rich
nature
but
how
it
been
wasted
and
turned
back
upon
itself
poor
untrained
impulsive
innocent
creature
my
heart
aches
for
her
it
been
hard
to
bear
with
her
at
times
terribly
hard
and
find
it
so
ben
but
you
bear
with
her
the
awfulest
thing
about
people
in
trouble
is
that
they
are
such
they
tire
you
to
death
but
you
only
have
to
stand
her
praises
of
what
bartley
was
and
we
had
to
stand
them
and
her
hopes
of
what
you
would
be
if
you
were
only
at
home
besides
i
do
know
what
all
she
expects
of
you
but
you
must
try
not
to
disappoint
her
she
worships
the
ground
you
tread
on
and
i
really
think
she
believes
you
can
do
anything
you
will
just
because
you
halleck
listened
in
silence
he
was
indeed
helpless
to
be
otherwise
than
constant
with
shame
and
grief
in
his
heart
he
could
only
vow
her
there
the
greater
fealty
because
of
the
change
he
found
in
her
he
was
doomed
at
every
meeting
to
hear
her
glorify
a
man
whom
he
believed
a
heartless
traitor
to
plot
with
her
for
the
rescue
from
imaginary
captivity
of
the
wretch
who
had
cruelly
forsaken
her
he
actually
took
some
of
the
steps
she
urged
he
addressed
inquiries
to
the
insane
asylums
far
and
near
and
in
these
futile
endeavors
made
only
with
the
desire
of
failure
his
own
reason
seemed
sometimes
to
waver
she
insisted
that
atherton
should
know
all
the
steps
they
were
taking
and
his
sense
of
his
old
exact
and
perfect
knowledge
of
his
motives
was
a
keener
torture
than
even
her
father
silent
scorn
of
his
efforts
or
the
worship
in
which
his
own
family
held
him
for
them
xxxvii
halleck
had
come
home
in
broken
health
and
had
promised
his
family
with
the
that
depraves
not
to
go
away
again
since
the
change
had
done
him
no
good
there
was
no
talk
for
the
present
of
his
trying
to
do
anything
but
to
get
well
and
for
a
while
under
the
strong
excitement
he
seemed
to
be
better
but
suddenly
he
failed
he
kept
his
room
and
then
he
kept
his
bed
and
the
weeks
stretched
into
months
before
he
left
it
when
the
spring
weather
came
he
was
able
to
go
out
again
and
he
spent
most
of
his
time
in
the
open
air
feeling
every
day
a
fresh
accession
of
strength
at
the
end
of
one
long
april
afternoon
he
walked
home
with
a
light
heart
whose
right
to
rejoice
he
would
not
let
his
conscience
question
he
had
met
marcia
in
the
public
garden
where
they
sat
down
on
a
bench
and
talked
while
her
father
and
the
little
girl
wandered
away
in
the
restlessness
of
age
and
the
restlessness
of
childhood
we
are
going
home
to
equity
this
summer
she
said
and
perhaps
we
shall
not
come
back
no
we
shall
not
come
back
have
given
i
have
waited
hoping
hoping
but
now
i
know
that
it
is
no
use
waiting
any
longer
is
she
spoke
in
tearless
resignation
and
the
peace
of
accepted
widowhood
seemed
to
diffuse
itself
around
her
her
words
repeated
themselves
to
halleck
as
he
walked
homeward
he
found
the
postman
at
the
door
with
a
newspaper
which
he
took
from
him
with
a
smile
at
its
veteran
appearance
and
its
probable
adventures
in
reaching
him
the
wrapper
seemed
to
have
been
several
times
slipped
off
and
then
slit
up
it
was
tied
with
a
string
now
and
was
scribbled
with
rejections
in
the
hands
of
various
hallocks
and
halletts
one
of
whom
had
finally
indorsed
upon
it
try
rumford
it
was
originally
addressed
as
he
made
out
to
mr
halleck
boston
and
he
carried
it
to
his
room
before
he
opened
it
with
a
careless
surmise
as
to
its
interest
for
him
it
proved
to
be
a
flimsy
shabbily
printed
country
newspaper
with
an
advertisement

this

milikin
ayres
for
plff
halleck
read
this
advertisement
again
and
again
with
a
dull
mechanical
action
of
the
brain
he
saw
the
familiar
names
but
they
were
hopelessly
estranged
by
their
present
relation
to
each
other
the
legal
jargon
reached
no
intelligence
in
him
that
could
grasp
its
purport
when
his
daze
began
to
yield
he
took
evidence
of
his
own
reality
by
some
such
tests
as
one
might
in
waking
from
a
long
faint
he
looked
at
his
hands
his
feet
he
rose
and
looked
at
his
face
in
the
glass
turning
about
he
saw
the
paper
where
he
had
left
it
on
the
table
it
was
no
illusion
he
picked
up
the
cover
from
the
floor
and
scanned
it
anew
trying
to
remember
the
handwriting
on
it
to
make
out
who
had
sent
this
paper
to
him
and
why
then
the
address
seemed
to
grow
into
something
different
under
his
eye
it
ceased
to
be
his
name
he
saw
now
that
the
paper
was
directed
to
hubbard
and
that
by
a
series
of
accidents
and
errors
it
had
failed
to
reach
her
in
its
wanderings
and
by
a
final
blunder
had
fallen
into
his
hands
once
solved
it
was
a
very
simple
affair
and
he
had
now
but
to
carry
it
to
her
that
was
very
simple
too
or
he
might
destroy
it
this
was
equally
simple
her
words
repeated
themselves
once
more
i
have
given
up
he
is
why
should
he
break
the
peace
she
had
found
and
destroy
her
last
sad
illusion
why
should
he
not
spare
her
the
knowledge
of
this
final
wrong
and
let
the
merciful
injustice
accomplish
itself
the
questions
seemed
scarcely
to
have
any
personal
concern
for
halleck
his
temptation
wore
a
heavenly
aspect
it
softly
pleaded
with
him
to
forbear
like
something
outside
of
himself
it
was
when
he
began
to
resist
it
that
he
found
it
the
breath
in
his
nostrils
the
blood
in
his
veins
then
the
mask
dropped
and
the
enemy
of
souls
put
forth
his
power
against
this
weak
spirit
enfeebled
by
long
strife
and
defeat
already
acknowledged
at
the
end
halleck
opened
his
door
and
called
olive
olive
in
a
voice
that
thrilled
the
girl
with
strange
alarm
where
she
sat
in
her
own
room
she
came
running
and
found
him
clinging
to
his
doorpost
pale
and
tremulous
i
want
you
want
you
to
help
me
he
gasped
i
want
to
show
you
something
look
here
he
gave
her
the
paper
which
he
had
kept
behind
him
clutched
fast
in
his
hand
as
if
he
feared
it
might
somehow
escape
him
at
last
and
staggered
away
to
a
chair
his
sister
read
the
notice
oh
ben
she
dropped
her
hands
with
the
paper
in
them
before
her
a
gesture
of
helpless
horror
and
pity
and
looked
at
him
does
know
it
has
she
seen
it
no
one
knows
it
but
you
and
i
the
paper
was
left
here
for
me
by
mistake
i
opened
it
before
i
saw
that
it
was
addressed
to
he
panted
forth
these
sentences
in
an
exhaustion
that
would
have
terrified
her
if
she
had
not
been
too
full
of
indignant
compassion
for
marcia
to
know
anything
else
she
tried
to
speak
do
you
understand
olive
this
is
the
notice
that
the
law
requires
she
shall
have
to
come
and
defend
her
cause
and
it
has
been
sent
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
there
to
the
address
that
villain
must
have
given
in
the
knowledge
that
it
could
reach
her
only
by
one
chance
in
ten
and
it
has
come
to
you
oh
ben
who
sent
it
to
the
brother
and
sister
looked
at
each
other
but
neither
spoke
the
awestricken
thought
that
was
in
both
their
hearts
ben
she
cried
in
a
solemn
ecstasy
of
love
and
pride
i
would
rather
be
you
this
minute
than
any
other
man
in
the
world
do
pleaded
halleck
his
head
dropped
and
then
he
lifted
it
by
a
sudden
impulse
olive
but
the
impulse
failed
and
he
only
said
i
want
you
to
go
to
atherton
with
me
we
must
lose
time
have
cyrus
get
a
carriage
go
down
and
tell
them
we
going
out
i
be
ready
as
soon
as
you
but
when
she
called
to
him
from
below
that
the
carriage
had
come
and
she
was
waiting
he
would
have
refused
to
go
with
her
if
he
durst
he
no
longer
wished
to
keep
back
the
fact
but
he
felt
an
invalid
weariness
of
it
a
sick
man
inadequacy
to
the
farther
demands
it
should
make
upon
him
he
crept
slowly
down
the
stairs
keeping
a
tremulous
hold
upon
the
rail
and
he
sank
with
a
sigh
against
the
carriage
cushions
answering
olive
eager
questions
and
fervid
comments
with
languid
monosyllables
they
found
the
athertons
at
coffee
and
clara
would
have
them
come
to
the
and
join
them
halleck
refused
the
coffee
and
while
olive
told
what
had
happened
he
looked
listlessly
about
the
room
aware
of
a
perverse
sympathy
with
bartley
from
bartley
point
of
view
bartley
might
never
have
gone
wrong
if
he
had
had
all
that
luxury
and
why
should
he
not
have
had
it
as
well
as
atherton
what
right
had
the
untempted
prosperity
of
such
a
man
to
judge
the
guilt
of
such
men
as
himself
and
bartley
hubbard
olive
produced
the
newspaper
from
her
lap
where
she
kept
both
hands
upon
it
and
opened
it
to
the
advertisement
in
dramatic
corroboration
of
what
she
had
been
telling
atherton
he
read
it
and
passed
it
to
clara
when
did
this
come
to
you
olive
answered
for
him
this
evening
just
now
did
i
say
that
no
said
atherton
and
he
added
to
halleck
gently
i
beg
your
pardon
did
you
notice
the
dates
yes
answered
halleck
with
cold
refusal
of
atherton
tone
of
reparation
the
cause
is
set
for
hearing
on
the
said
atherton
this
is
the
the
time
is
very
it
long
enough
said
halleck
wearily
oh
telegraph
cried
clara
telegraph
them
instantly
that
she
never
dreamt
of
leaving
him
abandonment
oh
if
they
only
knew
how
she
had
been
slaving
her
lingers
off
for
the
last
two
years
to
keep
a
home
for
him
to
come
back
to
they
give
the
divorce
atherton
smiled
and
turned
to
halleck
do
you
know
what
their
law
is
now
it
was
changed
two
years
yes
said
halleck
replying
to
the
question
atherton
had
asked
and
the
subtler
question
he
had
looked
i
have
read
up
the
whole
subject
since
i
came
home
the
divorce
is
granted
only
upon
proof
even
when
the
defendant
fails
to
appear
and
if
this
were
to
go
against
us
he
instinctively
identified
himself
with
marcia
cause
we
can
have
the
default
set
aside
and
a
new
trial
granted
for
cause
the
women
listened
in
awe
of
the
legal
phrases
but
when
atherton
rose
and
asked
is
your
carriage
here
his
wife
sprang
to
her
feet
why
where
are
you
going
she
demanded
anxiously
not
to
indiana
immediately
answered
her
husband
we
first
going
to
clover
street
to
see
squire
gaylord
and
hubbard
better
let
me
take
the
paper
dear
he
said
softly
withdrawing
it
from
her
hands
oh
it
a
cruel
cruel
law
she
moaned
deprived
of
this
moral
support
to
suppose
that
such
a
notice
as
this
is
sufficient
women
could
have
made
such
a
no
women
only
profit
by
such
laws
after
they
made
they
work
both
ways
but
it
not
such
a
bad
law
as
divorce
laws
go
we
do
worse
now
in
some
new
england
they
found
the
squire
alone
in
the
parlor
and
with
a
few
words
of
explanation
atherton
put
the
paper
in
his
hands
and
he
read
the
notice
in
emotionless
quiet
then
he
took
off
his
spectacles
and
shut
them
in
their
case
which
he
put
back
into
his
waistcoat
pocket
this
is
all
right
he
said
he
cleared
his
throat
and
lifting
the
fierce
glimmer
of
his
eyes
to
atherton
he
asked
drily
what
is
the
law
at
present
atherton
briefly
recapitulated
the
points
as
he
had
them
from
halleck
that
good
said
the
old
man
we
will
fight
this
he
rose
and
from
his
gaunt
height
looked
down
on
both
of
them
with
his
sinuous
lips
set
in
a
bitter
smile
bartley
must
have
been
disappointed
when
he
found
a
divorce
so
hard
to
get
in
indiana
he
must
have
thought
that
the
old
law
was
still
in
force
there
he
not
the
fellow
to
swear
to
a
lie
if
he
could
help
it
but
i
guess
he
expects
to
get
this
divorce
by
marcia
was
putting
little
flavia
to
bed
she
heard
the
talking
below
she
thought
she
heard
bartley
name
she
ran
to
the
stairs
and
came
hesitantly
down
the
old
wild
hope
and
wild
terror
fluttering
her
pulse
and
taking
her
breath
at
sight
of
the
three
men
apparently
in
council
she
crept
toward
them
holding
out
her
hands
before
her
like
one
groping
his
way
what
what
is
it
she
looked
from
atherton
face
to
her
father
the
old
man
stopped
and
tried
to
smile
reassuringly
he
tried
to
speak
atherton
turned
away
it
was
halleck
who
came
forward
and
took
her
wandering
hands
he
held
them
quivering
in
his
own
and
said
gravely
and
steadily
using
her
name
for
the
first
time
in
the
deep
pity
which
cast
out
all
fear
and
shame
marcia
we
have
found
your
dead
she
made
with
her
lips
he
is
alive
said
halleck
there
is
something
in
this
paper
for
you
to
see
something
you
see
i
can
bear
anything
if
he
is
not
dead
where
what
is
it
show
it
to
me
the
paper
shook
in
the
hands
which
halleck
released
her
eyes
strayed
blindly
over
its
columns
he
had
to
put
his
finger
on
the
place
before
she
could
find
it
then
her
tremor
ceased
and
she
seemed
without
breath
or
pulse
while
she
read
it
through
she
fetched
a
long
deep
sigh
and
passed
her
hand
over
her
eyes
as
if
to
clear
them
staying
herself
unconsciously
against
halleck
breast
and
laying
her
trembling
arm
along
his
arm
till
her
fingers
knit
themselves
among
his
fingers
she
read
it
a
second
time
and
a
third
then
she
dropped
the
paper
and
turned
to
look
up
at
him
why
she
cried
as
if
she
had
made
it
out
at
last
while
an
awful
joyful
light
of
hope
flashed
into
her
face
is
a
do
you
see
he
thinks
that
i
never
came
back
he
thinks
that
i
meant
to
abandon
him
that
i
that
i
but
you
that
i
came
back
you
came
back
me
why
i
was
gone
an
hour
a
hardly
oh
bartley
poor
bartley
he
thought
i
could
leave
him
and
take
his
child
from
him
that
i
could
be
so
wicked
so
heartless
oh
no
no
no
why
i
only
stayed
away
that
little
time
because
i
was
to
go
back
do
you
remember
how
i
told
you
i
was
afraid
and
wanted
you
to
come
in
with
me
her
exaltation
broke
in
a
laugh
but
we
can
explain
it
now
and
it
will
be
all
right
he
will
see
he
will
understand
i
will
tell
him
just
how
it
was
oh
flavia
flavia
we
found
papa
we
found
papa
quick
she
whirled
away
toward
the
stairs
but
her
father
caught
her
by
the
arm
marcia
he
shouted
in
his
old
raucous
voice
you
got
to
understand
this
he
hesitated
as
if
running
over
all
terms
of
opprobrium
in
his
mind
and
he
resumed
as
if
he
had
found
them
each
too
feeble
has
acted
under
any
he
set
the
facts
before
her
with
merciless
clearness
and
she
listened
with
an
audible
catching
of
the
breath
at
times
while
she
softly
smoothed
her
forehead
with
her
left
hand
i
do
believe
it
she
said
when
he
had
ended
write
to
him
tell
him
what
i
say
and
you
will
the
old
man
uttered
something
between
a
groan
and
a
curse
oh
you
poor
crazy
child
can
nothing
make
you
understand
that
bartley
wants
to
get
rid
of
you
and
that
he
just
as
ready
for
one
lie
as
another
he
thinks
he
can
make
out
a
case
of
abandonment
with
the
least
trouble
and
so
he
accuses
you
of
that
but
he
just
as
soon
accuse
you
of
anything
else
to
him
you
got
to
to
him
you
got
to
go
out
there
and
fight
him
in
open
court
with
facts
and
witnesses
do
you
suppose
bartley
hubbard
wants
any
explanation
from
you
do
you
think
he
been
waiting
these
two
years
to
hear
that
you
did
really
abandon
him
but
came
back
to
this
house
an
hour
after
you
left
it
and
that
you
waited
for
him
here
ever
since
when
he
knows
that
will
he
withdraw
this
suit
of
his
and
come
home
he
want
the
proof
and
the
way
to
do
is
to
go
out
there
and
let
him
have
it
if
i
had
him
on
the
stand
for
five
minutes
said
the
old
man
between
his
set
teeth
five
i
undertake
to
convince
him
from
his
own
lips
that
he
was
wrong
about
you
but
i
am
afraid
he
would
mind
a
letter
you
think
i
say
so
because
i
hate
him
and
you
do
believe
me
well
ask
either
of
these
gentlemen
here
whether
telling
you
the
she
did
not
speak
but
with
a
glance
at
their
averted
faces
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
passed
one
hand
over
the
other
while
she
drew
her
breath
in
long
shuddering
respirations
and
stared
at
the
floor
with
knit
brows
and
starting
eyes
like
one
stifling
a
deadly
pang
she
made
several
attempts
to
speak
before
she
could
utter
any
sound
then
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
her
father
let
us
let
us
go
home
oh
let
us
go
home
i
will
give
him
up
i
given
him
up
already
i
told
you
she
said
turning
to
halleck
and
speaking
in
a
slow
gentle
tone
only
an
hour
ago
that
he
was
dead
and
this
this
that
happened
it
makes
no
difference
why
did
you
bring
the
paper
to
me
when
you
knew
that
i
thought
he
was
dead
god
knows
i
wished
to
keep
it
from
well
no
matter
now
let
him
go
free
if
he
wants
to
i
ca
help
you
help
it
interrupted
her
father
you
got
the
facts
on
your
side
and
you
got
the
witnesses
would
you
go
out
with
me
and
tell
him
that
i
never
meant
to
leave
him
she
asked
simply
turning
to
halleck
you
and
olive
we
would
do
anything
for
you
marcia
she
sat
musing
and
drawing
her
hands
one
over
the
other
again
while
her
quivering
breath
came
and
went
on
the
silence
she
let
her
hands
fall
nervelessly
on
her
lap
i
ca
go
i
too
weak
i
could
bear
the
journey
no
she
shook
her
head
i
ca
go
marcia
began
her
father
it
your
to
go
does
it
say
in
the
law
that
i
have
to
go
if
i
do
choose
she
asked
of
halleck
no
you
certainly
need
not
go
if
you
do
choose
then
i
will
stay
do
you
think
it
my
duty
to
go
she
asked
referring
her
question
first
to
halleck
and
then
to
atherton
she
turned
from
the
silence
by
which
they
tried
to
leave
her
free
i
do
care
for
my
duty
any
more
i
do
want
to
keep
him
if
it
so
that
he
left
me
and
and
meant
it
and
he
does
care
for
me
any
care
for
you
he
never
cared
for
you
marcia
and
you
may
be
sure
he
does
care
for
you
then
let
him
go
and
let
us
go
very
well
said
the
old
man
we
will
go
home
then
and
before
the
week
out
bartley
hubbard
will
be
a
perjured
bigamist
marcia
leaped
to
her
feet
yes
bigamist
do
you
suppose
he
had
his
eye
on
some
other
woman
out
there
before
he
began
this
suit
the
languor
was
gone
from
marcia
limbs
as
she
confronted
her
father
the
wonderful
likeness
in
the
outline
of
their
faces
appeared
his
was
dark
and
wrinkled
with
age
and
hers
was
gray
with
the
anger
that
drove
the
blood
back
to
her
heart
but
one
impulse
animated
those
fierce
profiles
and
the
hoarded
hate
in
the
old
man
soul
seemed
to
speak
in
marcia
thick
whisper
i
will
xxxviii
the
athertons
sat
late
over
their
breakfast
in
the
luxurious
where
the
april
sun
came
in
at
the
windows
overlooking
the
back
bay
and
commanding
at
that
stage
of
the
tide
a
long
stretch
of
shallow
with
a
flight
of
white
gulls
settled
upon
it
they
had
let
clara
house
on
the
hill
and
she
had
bought
another
on
the
new
land
she
insisted
upon
the
change
not
only
because
everybody
was
leaving
the
hill
but
also
because
as
she
said
it
would
seem
too
much
like
taking
atherton
to
board
if
they
went
to
housekeeping
where
she
had
always
lived
she
wished
to
give
him
the
effect
before
the
world
of
having
brought
her
to
a
house
of
his
own
she
had
even
furnished
it
anew
for
the
most
part
and
had
banished
as
far
as
possible
the
things
that
reminded
her
of
the
time
when
she
was
not
his
wife
he
humored
her
in
this
fantastic
and
philosophized
her
wish
to
give
him
the
appearance
of
having
the
money
as
something
orderly
in
its
origin
and
not
to
be
deprecated
on
other
grounds
since
probably
it
deceived
nobody
they
lived
a
very
tranquil
life
and
clara
had
no
grief
of
her
own
unless
it
was
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
great
things
she
could
do
for
him
one
day
when
she
whimsically
complained
of
this
he
said
i
very
glad
of
that
try
to
be
equal
to
the
little
sacrifices
we
must
make
for
each
other
they
will
be
quite
enough
many
a
woman
who
would
be
ready
to
die
for
her
husband
makes
him
wretched
because
she
wo
live
for
him
do
despise
the
day
of
small
yes
but
when
every
day
seems
the
day
of
small
things
she
pouted
every
day
the
day
of
small
things
said
atherton
with
people
who
are
happy
we
never
so
prosperous
as
when
we
ca
remember
what
happened
last
oh
but
i
ca
bear
to
be
always
living
in
the
it
not
so
spacious
i
know
as
either
the
past
or
the
future
but
all
we
there
cried
clara
that
it
than
fatalism
and
is
fatalism
so
very
bad
asked
her
husband
it
mahometanism
well
it
is
necessarily
a
plurality
of
wives
returned
atherton
in
subtle
anticipation
of
her
next
point
and
it
really
only
another
name
for
resignation
which
is
certainly
a
good
resignation
oh
i
do
know
about
that
atherton
laughed
and
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
an
argument
that
no
woman
can
answer
in
a
man
she
loves
it
seems
to
deprive
her
of
her
reasoning
faculties
in
the
atmosphere
of
affection
which
she
breathed
she
sometimes
feared
that
her
mental
powers
were
really
weakening
as
a
girl
she
had
lived
a
life
full
of
purposes
which
if
somewhat
vague
were
unquestionably
large
she
had
then
had
great
interests
art
music
literature
the
symphony
concerts
hunt
classes
the
novels
of
george
eliot
and
mr
fiske
lectures
on
the
cosmic
philosophy
and
she
had
always
felt
that
they
expanded
and
elevated
existence
in
her
moments
of
question
as
to
the
shape
which
her
life
had
taken
since
she
tried
to
think
whether
the
happiness
which
seemed
so
little
dependent
on
these
things
was
not
beneath
the
demands
of
a
spirit
which
was
probably
immortal
and
was
certainly
cultivated
they
all
continued
to
be
part
of
her
life
but
only
a
very
small
part
and
she
would
have
liked
to
ask
her
husband
whether
his
influence
upon
her
had
been
wholly
beneficial
she
was
not
sure
that
it
had
but
neither
was
she
sure
that
it
had
not
she
had
never
fully
consented
to
the
distinctness
with
which
he
classified
all
her
emotions
and
ideas
as
those
of
a
woman
in
her
heart
she
doubted
whether
a
great
many
of
them
might
not
be
those
of
a
man
though
she
had
never
found
any
of
them
exactly
like
his
she
could
not
complain
that
he
did
not
treat
her
as
an
equal
he
deferred
to
her
and
depended
upon
her
good
sense
to
an
extent
that
sometimes
alarmed
her
for
she
secretly
knew
that
she
had
a
very
large
streak
of
silliness
in
her
nature
he
seemed
to
tell
her
everything
and
to
be
greatly
ruled
by
her
advice
especially
in
matters
of
business
but
she
could
not
help
observing
that
he
often
kept
matters
involving
certain
moral
questions
from
her
till
the
moment
for
deciding
them
was
past
when
she
accused
him
of
this
he
confessed
that
it
was
so
but
defended
himself
by
saying
that
he
was
afraid
her
conscience
might
sway
him
against
his
judgment
clara
now
recurred
to
these
words
of
his
as
she
sat
looking
at
him
through
her
tears
across
the
breakfast
table
was
that
the
reason
you
never
told
me
about
poor
ben
before
yes
and
i
expect
you
to
justify
me
what
good
would
it
have
done
to
tell
you
i
could
have
told
you
at
least
that
if
ben
had
any
such
feeling
as
that
it
was
fault
but
you
would
have
believed
that
clara
said
atherton
you
know
that
whatever
that
poor
creature
faults
are
coquetry
is
one
of
clara
only
admitted
the
fact
passively
how
did
he
excuse
himself
for
coming
back
she
asked
he
did
excuse
himself
he
defied
himself
we
had
a
stormy
talk
and
he
ended
by
denying
that
he
had
any
social
duty
in
the
and
i
think
he
was
quite
right
clara
flashed
out
it
was
his
own
he
said
he
had
a
concrete
purpose
and
would
listen
to
abstractions
yes
he
talked
like
a
woman
but
you
know
he
was
right
clara
though
talk
like
a
woman
too
there
are
a
great
many
things
that
are
not
wrong
except
as
they
wrong
others
i
no
doubt
that
as
compared
with
the
highest
love
her
husband
ever
felt
for
her
ben
passion
was
as
light
to
darkness
but
if
he
could
only
hope
for
its
return
through
the
perversion
of
her
soul
through
teaching
her
to
think
of
escape
from
her
marriage
by
a
divorce
then
it
was
a
crime
against
her
and
against
ben
could
do
such
a
thing
no
he
could
only
dream
of
doing
it
when
it
came
to
the
attempt
everything
that
was
good
in
him
revolted
against
it
and
conspired
to
make
him
help
her
in
the
efforts
that
would
defeat
his
hopes
if
they
succeeded
it
was
a
ghastly
ordeal
but
it
was
sublime
and
when
the
climax
came
that
paper
which
he
had
only
to
conceal
for
a
few
days
or
weeks
he
was
equal
to
the
demand
upon
him
but
suppose
a
man
of
his
pure
training
and
traditions
had
yielded
to
temptation
suppose
he
had
so
far
depraved
himself
that
he
could
have
set
about
persuading
her
that
she
owed
no
allegiance
to
her
husband
and
might
rightfully
get
a
divorce
and
marry
him
what
a
ruinous
blow
it
would
have
been
to
all
who
knew
of
it
it
would
have
disheartened
those
who
abhorred
it
and
encouraged
those
who
wanted
to
profit
by
such
an
example
it
does
matter
much
socially
what
undisciplined
people
like
bartley
and
marcia
hubbard
do
but
if
a
man
like
ben
halleck
goes
astray
it
calamitous
it
the
human
conscience
as
victor
hugo
says
all
that
careful
nurture
in
the
right
since
he
could
speak
all
that
decency
of
thought
and
act
that
noble
ideal
of
unselfishness
and
responsibility
to
others
trampled
under
foot
and
spit
upon
it
horrible
yes
answered
clara
deeply
moved
even
as
a
woman
may
be
in
a
pretty
and
such
a
good
soul
as
ben
always
was
naturally
will
you
have
some
more
tea
yes
i
will
take
another
cup
but
as
for
natural
goodness
wait
i
will
ring
for
some
hot
when
the
maid
had
appeared
disappeared
reappeared
and
finally
vanished
atherton
resumed
the
natural
goodness
does
count
the
natural
man
is
a
wild
beast
and
his
natural
goodness
is
the
amiability
of
a
beast
basking
in
the
sun
when
his
stomach
is
full
the
hubbards
were
full
of
natural
goodness
i
dare
say
when
they
did
happen
to
cross
each
other
wishes
no
it
the
implanted
goodness
that
saves
the
seed
of
righteousness
treasured
from
generation
to
generation
and
carefully
watched
and
tended
by
disciplined
fathers
and
mothers
in
the
hearts
where
they
have
dropped
it
the
flower
of
this
implanted
goodness
is
what
we
call
civilization
the
condition
of
general
uprightness
that
halleck
declared
he
owed
no
allegiance
to
but
he
was
better
than
his
atherton
lifted
with
his
slim
delicate
hand
the
cup
of
translucent
china
and
drained
off
the
fragrant
souchong
sweetened
and
tempered
with
jersey
cream
to
perfection
something
in
the
sight
went
like
a
pang
to
his
wife
heart
ah
she
said
it
is
easy
enough
for
us
to
condemn
have
everything
we
want
i
do
forget
that
clara
said
atherton
gravely
sometimes
when
i
think
of
it
i
am
ready
to
renounce
all
judgment
of
others
the
consciousness
of
our
comfort
our
luxury
almost
paralyzes
me
at
those
times
and
i
am
ashamed
and
afraid
even
of
our
yes
what
right
pursued
clara
rebelliously
have
we
to
be
happy
and
united
and
these
wretched
creatures
so
no
right
none
in
the
world
but
somehow
the
effects
follow
their
causes
in
some
sort
they
chose
misery
for
themselves
we
make
our
own
hell
in
this
life
and
the
next
or
it
was
chosen
for
them
by
undisciplined
wills
that
they
inherited
in
the
long
run
their
fate
must
be
a
just
ah
but
i
have
to
look
at
things
in
the
run
and
i
ca
see
any
justice
in
marcia
husband
using
her
so
cried
clara
why
you
use
me
badly
i
do
believe
that
any
woman
ever
meant
better
by
her
husband
than
she
oh
the
meaning
does
count
it
our
deeds
that
judge
us
he
is
a
thoroughly
bad
fellow
but
you
may
be
sure
she
has
been
to
blame
though
i
do
blame
the
hubbards
either
of
them
so
much
as
i
blame
halleck
he
not
only
had
everything
he
wished
but
the
training
to
know
what
he
ought
to
i
do
know
about
his
having
everything
i
think
ben
must
have
been
disappointed
some
time
said
clara
evasively
oh
that
nothing
replied
atherton
with
the
contented
indifference
to
sentimental
grievances
clara
did
not
speak
for
some
moments
and
then
she
summed
up
a
turmoil
of
thoughts
in
a
profound
sigh
well
i
do
like
it
i
thought
it
was
bad
enough
having
a
man
even
on
the
outskirts
of
my
acquaintance
abandon
his
wife
but
now
ben
halleck
who
has
been
like
a
brother
to
me
to
have
him
mixed
up
in
such
an
affair
in
the
way
he
is
it
intolerable
i
agree
with
you
said
atherton
playing
with
his
spoon
you
know
how
i
hate
anything
that
sins
against
order
and
this
whole
thing
is
disorderly
it
intolerable
as
you
say
but
we
must
bear
our
share
of
it
we
all
bound
together
no
one
sins
or
suffers
to
himself
in
a
civilized
state
or
religious
state
it
the
same
thing
every
link
in
the
chain
feels
the
effect
of
the
violence
more
or
less
intimately
we
rise
or
fall
together
in
christian
society
it
strange
that
it
should
be
so
hard
to
realize
a
thing
that
every
experience
of
life
teaches
we
keep
on
thinking
of
offences
against
the
common
good
as
if
they
were
abstractions
well
thing
said
clara
i
shall
always
think
unnecessarily
shocking
and
disgraceful
about
it
and
that
is
ben
going
out
with
her
on
this
journey
i
do
see
how
you
could
allow
that
yes
said
atherton
after
a
thoughtful
silence
it
shocking
the
only
consolation
is
that
it
is
unnecessarily
shocking
i
afraid
that
it
necessarily
so
when
any
disease
of
soul
or
body
has
gone
far
enough
it
makes
its
own
conditions
and
other
things
must
adjust
themselves
to
it
besides
no
one
knows
the
ugliness
of
the
situation
but
halleck
himself
i
do
see
how
i
could
have
interfered
and
upon
the
whole
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
have
interfered
if
i
could
she
would
be
helpless
without
him
and
he
can
get
no
harm
from
it
in
fact
it
part
of
his
expiation
which
must
have
begun
as
soon
as
he
met
her
again
after
he
came
clara
was
convinced
but
not
reconciled
she
only
said
i
do
like
her
husband
did
not
reply
he
continued
musingly
when
the
old
man
made
that
final
appeal
to
her
jealousy
all
that
there
is
really
left
probably
of
her
love
for
her
husband
and
she
responded
with
a
face
as
wicked
as
his
i
could
help
looking
at
halleck
oh
poor
ben
did
he
take
it
it
must
have
scared
it
must
have
disgusted
him
that
what
i
had
expected
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
face
but
pity
he
understood
and
he
pitied
her
that
was
clara
rose
and
turned
to
the
window
where
she
remained
looking
through
her
tears
at
the
gulls
on
the
shallow
it
seemed
much
more
than
hours
since
she
had
taken
leave
of
marcia
and
the
rest
at
the
station
and
saw
them
set
out
on
their
long
journey
with
its
uncertain
and
unimaginable
end
she
had
deeply
sympathized
with
them
all
but
at
the
same
time
she
had
felt
very
keenly
the
potential
scandalousness
of
the
situation
she
shuddered
inwardly
when
she
thought
what
if
people
knew
she
had
always
revolted
from
contact
with
such
social
facts
as
their
errand
involved
she
got
olive
aside
for
a
moment
and
asked
her
do
you
it
olive
did
you
ever
dream
of
being
mixed
up
in
such
a
thing
i
should
die
simply
i
shall
not
think
of
dying
unless
we
fail
answered
olive
and
as
for
hating
it
i
have
consulted
my
feelings
a
great
deal
but
i
rather
think
i
like
like
going
out
to
be
a
witness
in
an
indiana
divorce
case
i
do
look
at
it
in
that
way
clara
it
a
crusade
to
me
it
a
holy
war
it
the
cause
of
an
innocent
woman
against
a
wicked
oppression
i
know
how
would
feel
about
it
clara
but
i
never
as
respectable
as
you
are
and
i
quite
satisfied
to
do
what
ben
and
father
and
atherton
approve
they
think
it
my
duty
and
i
am
glad
to
go
and
to
be
of
all
the
use
i
can
but
you
shall
have
my
heartfelt
sympathy
through
all
clara
for
your
involuntary
acquaintance
with
our
olive
you
that
i
proud
of
your
courage
and
ben
goodness
and
that
i
fully
appreciate
the
sacrifice
you
making
and
i
not
ashamed
of
your
business
i
think
it
grand
and
sublime
and
i
would
just
as
soon
scream
it
out
at
the
top
of
my
voice
right
here
in
the
albany
do
said
olive
it
would
frighten
the
she
had
flavia
by
the
hand
and
she
made
the
little
girl
her
special
charge
throughout
the
journey
the
old
squire
seemed
anxious
to
be
alone
and
he
restlessly
escaped
from
marcia
care
he
sat
all
the
first
day
apart
chewing
upon
some
fragment
of
wood
that
he
had
picked
up
and
now
and
then
putting
up
a
lank
hand
to
rasp
his
bristling
jaw
glancing
furtively
at
people
who
passed
him
and
lapsing
into
his
ruminant
abstraction
he
had
been
vexed
that
they
did
not
start
the
night
before
and
every
halt
the
train
made
visibly
afflicted
him
he
would
not
leave
his
place
to
get
anything
to
eat
when
they
stopped
for
refreshment
though
he
hungrily
devoured
the
lunch
that
marcia
brought
into
the
car
for
him
at
new
york
he
was
in
a
tumult
of
fear
lest
they
should
lose
the
connecting
train
on
the
pennsylvania
road
and
the
sigh
of
relief
with
which
he
sank
into
his
seat
in
the
expressed
the
suffering
he
had
undergone
he
said
he
was
not
tired
but
he
went
to
bed
early
as
if
to
sleep
away
as
much
of
the
time
as
he
could
when
halleck
came
into
their
car
the
next
morning
he
found
marcia
and
her
father
sitting
together
and
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
wooded
slopes
of
the
alleghanies
through
which
the
train
was
running
the
old
impatience
had
relaxed
he
let
marcia
lay
her
hand
on
his
and
he
answered
her
with
quiet
submission
when
she
spoke
now
and
then
of
the
difference
between
these
valleys
where
the
wild
rhododendrons
were
growing
and
the
frozen
hollows
of
the
hills
at
home
which
must
be
still
choked
with
snow
but
oh
how
much
i
would
rather
see
them
she
said
at
last
with
a
homesick
throb
well
he
assented
we
can
go
right
back
yes
she
whispered
well
sir
good
morning
said
the
old
man
to
halleck
we
are
getting
along
sir
at
this
rate
unless
our
calculations
were
mistaken
we
shall
be
there
by
midnight
we
are
on
time
the
porter
tells
yes
we
shall
soon
be
at
pittsburg
said
halleck
and
he
looked
at
marcia
who
turned
away
her
face
she
had
not
spoken
of
the
object
of
the
journey
to
him
since
they
had
left
boston
and
it
had
not
been
so
nearly
touched
by
either
of
them
before
he
could
see
that
she
recoiled
from
it
but
the
old
man
once
having
approached
it
could
not
leave
it
if
everything
goes
well
we
shall
have
our
grip
on
that
fellow
throat
in
less
than
he
looked
down
mechanically
at
his
withered
hands
lean
and
yellow
like
the
talons
of
a
bird
and
lifted
his
accipitral
profile
with
a
predatory
alertness
i
did
sleep
very
well
the
last
part
of
the
night
but
i
thought
it
all
out
i
care
whether
i
get
there
before
or
after
judgment
is
rendered
all
i
want
is
to
get
there
before
he
has
a
chance
to
clear
out
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
convince
bartley
hubbard
that
there
is
a
god
in
israel
yet
do
you
be
anxious
marcia
i
got
this
thing
at
my
fingers
ends
as
clear
as
a
bell
i
intend
to
give
bartley
a
little
surprise
marcia
kept
her
face
averted
and
halleck
relinquished
his
purpose
of
sitting
down
with
them
and
went
forward
to
the
that
marcia
and
olive
had
occupied
with
the
little
girl
he
tapped
on
the
door
and
found
his
sister
dressed
but
the
child
still
asleep
what
is
the
matter
ben
she
asked
you
do
look
well
you
ought
to
have
undertaken
this
oh
i
all
right
but
i
been
up
a
good
while
with
nothing
to
eat
that
old
man
is
terrible
olive
her
father
yes
he
a
terrible
old
man
it
sickened
me
to
hear
him
talk
just
now
throwing
out
his
threats
of
vengeance
against
hubbard
it
made
me
feel
a
sort
of
sympathy
for
that
poor
dog
do
you
suppose
she
has
the
same
motive
i
could
forgive
her
he
said
with
a
kind
of
passionate
weakness
i
could
forgive
myself
we
got
nothing
to
do
with
their
motive
ben
we
are
to
be
her
witnesses
for
justice
against
a
wicked
wrong
i
do
believe
in
special
providences
of
course
but
it
does
seem
as
if
we
had
been
called
to
this
work
as
mother
would
say
your
happening
to
go
home
with
her
that
night
and
then
that
paper
happening
to
come
to
you
does
it
look
like
it
it
looks
like
it
we
could
have
refused
to
come
that
what
consoles
me
for
being
here
this
minute
i
put
on
a
bold
face
with
clara
atherton
yesterday
morning
at
the
depot
but
i
was
in
a
cold
chill
all
the
time
our
coming
off
in
this
way
on
such
an
errand
is
something
so
different
from
the
rest
of
our
whole
life
and
i
like
quiet
and
orderly
ways
and
all
that
we
call
respectability
i
been
thinking
that
the
trial
will
be
reported
by
some
such
interviewing
wretch
as
bartley
himself
and
that
we
shall
figure
in
the
newspapers
but
i
concluded
that
we
must
care
it
right
and
we
must
do
it
i
do
shut
my
eyes
to
the
kind
of
people
we
mixed
up
with
i
pity
marcia
and
i
love
her
poor
helpless
unguided
thing
but
that
old
man
terrible
he
as
cruel
as
the
grave
where
he
thinks
he
been
wronged
and
crueller
where
he
thinks
been
wronged
you
forgiven
so
much
ben
that
you
ca
understand
a
man
who
forgives
nothing
but
can
for
i
a
pretty
good
hater
myself
and
marcia
just
like
her
father
at
times
i
seen
her
look
at
clara
atherton
as
if
she
could
kill
her
the
little
girl
stirred
in
her
berth
and
then
lifted
herself
on
her
hands
and
stared
round
at
them
through
her
tangled
golden
hair
is
it
morning
yet
she
asked
sleepily
is
it
yes
it
flavia
said
olive
do
you
want
to
get
up
and
is
next
day
the
day
after
then
it
only
one
day
till
i
shall
see
papa
that
what
mamma
said
where
is
mamma
asked
the
child
rising
to
her
knees
and
sweeping
back
her
hair
from
her
face
with
either
hand
i
will
go
and
send
her
to
you
said
halleck
at
pittsburg
the
squire
was
eager
for
his
breakfast
and
made
amends
for
his
fast
of
the
day
before
he
ate
grossly
of
the
heterogeneous
abundance
of
the
railroad
restaurant
and
drank
two
cups
of
coffee
that
in
his
thin
native
air
would
have
disordered
his
pulse
for
a
week
but
he
resumed
his
journey
with
a
tranquil
strength
that
seemed
the
physical
expression
of
a
mind
clear
and
content
he
was
willing
and
even
anxious
to
tell
halleck
what
his
theories
and
plans
were
but
the
young
man
shrank
from
knowing
them
he
wished
only
to
know
whether
marcia
were
privy
to
them
and
this
too
he
shrank
from
knowing
xxxix
they
left
pittsburg
under
the
dun
pall
of
smoke
that
hangs
perpetually
over
the
city
and
ran
out
of
a
world
where
the
earth
seemed
turned
to
slag
and
cinders
and
the
coal
grime
blackened
even
the
sheathing
from
which
the
young
leaves
were
unfolding
their
vivid
green
their
train
twisted
along
the
banks
of
the
ohio
and
gave
them
now
and
then
a
reach
of
the
stream
forgetful
of
all
the
noisy
traffic
that
once
fretted
its
waters
and
losing
itself
in
almost
primitive
wildness
among
its
softly
rounded
hills
it
is
a
beautiful
land
and
it
had
even
to
their
loath
eyes
a
charm
that
touched
their
hearts
they
were
on
the
borders
of
the
illimitable
west
whose
lands
stretch
like
a
sea
beyond
the
hilly
ohio
shore
but
as
yet
this
vastness
which
appalls
and
wearies
all
but
the
born
westerner
had
not
burst
upon
them
they
were
still
among
heights
and
hollows
and
in
a
milder
and
softer
new
england
i
have
a
strange
feeling
about
this
journey
said
marcia
turning
from
the
window
at
last
and
facing
halleck
on
the
opposite
seat
i
want
it
to
be
over
and
yet
i
am
glad
of
every
little
stop
i
feel
like
some
one
that
has
been
called
to
a
and
is
hurrying
on
and
holding
back
with
all
her
might
at
the
same
time
i
shall
have
no
peace
till
i
am
there
and
then
shall
i
have
peace
she
fixed
her
eyes
imploringly
on
his
say
something
to
me
if
you
can
what
do
you
think
whether
you
will
succeed
he
was
confounding
what
he
knew
of
her
father
feeling
with
what
he
had
feared
of
hers
do
you
mean
about
the
lawsuit
i
do
care
for
that
do
you
think
he
will
hate
me
when
he
sees
me
do
you
think
he
will
believe
me
when
i
tell
him
that
i
never
meant
to
leave
him
and
that
i
sorry
for
what
i
did
to
drive
him
away
she
seemed
to
expect
him
to
answer
and
he
answered
as
well
as
he
could
he
ought
to
believe
that
yes
he
must
believe
then
all
the
rest
may
go
she
said
i
do
care
who
gains
the
case
but
if
he
should
believe
me
if
he
should
drive
me
away
from
him
as
i
drove
him
from
me
she
held
her
breath
in
the
terror
of
such
a
possibility
and
an
awe
of
her
ignorance
crept
over
halleck
apparently
she
had
not
understood
the
step
that
bartley
had
taken
except
as
a
stage
in
their
quarrel
from
which
they
could
both
retreat
if
they
would
as
easily
as
from
any
other
dispute
she
had
not
realized
it
as
a
final
an
almost
irrevocable
act
on
his
part
which
could
only
be
met
by
reprisal
on
hers
all
those
points
of
law
which
had
been
so
sharply
enforced
upon
her
must
have
fallen
blunted
from
her
longing
to
be
at
one
with
him
she
had
perhaps
not
imagined
her
defence
in
open
court
except
as
a
sort
of
public
reconciliation
but
at
another
time
she
recurred
to
her
wrongs
in
all
the
bitterness
of
her
father
vindictive
purpose
a
young
couple
entered
the
car
at
one
of
the
country
stations
and
the
bride
made
haste
to
take
off
her
white
bonnet
and
lay
her
cheek
on
her
husband
shoulder
while
he
passed
his
arm
round
her
silken
waist
and
drew
her
close
to
him
on
the
seat
in
the
loving
rapture
which
is
no
wise
inconvenienced
by
publicity
on
our
railroad
trains
indeed
after
the
first
general
recognition
of
their
condition
no
one
noticed
them
except
marcia
who
seemed
fascinated
by
the
spectacle
of
their
unsophisticated
happiness
it
must
have
recalled
the
blissful
abandon
of
her
own
wedding
journey
to
her
oh
poor
fool
she
said
to
olive
let
her
wait
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
she
will
know
that
she
had
better
lean
on
the
empty
air
than
on
him
some
day
he
will
let
her
fall
to
the
ground
and
when
she
gathers
herself
up
all
bruised
and
bleeding
but
he
has
got
the
simpleton
to
deal
with
that
he
used
to
have
and
he
shall
pay
me
back
for
all
drop
by
drop
and
ache
for
ache
she
was
in
that
strange
mental
condition
into
which
women
fall
who
brood
long
upon
opposing
purposes
and
desires
she
wished
to
be
reconciled
and
she
wished
to
be
revenged
and
she
recurred
to
either
wish
for
the
time
as
vehemently
as
if
the
other
did
not
exist
she
took
flavia
on
her
knee
and
began
to
prattle
to
her
of
seeing
papa
and
presently
she
turned
to
olive
and
said
i
know
he
will
find
us
both
a
great
deal
changed
flavia
looks
so
much
older
and
so
do
i
but
i
shall
soon
show
him
that
i
can
look
young
again
i
presume
he
changed
marcia
held
the
little
girl
up
at
the
window
they
had
now
left
the
river
hills
and
the
rolling
country
beyond
and
had
entered
the
great
plain
which
stretches
from
the
ohio
to
the
mississippi
and
mile
by
mile
as
they
ran
southward
and
westward
the
spring
unfolded
in
the
mellow
air
under
the
dull
warm
sun
the
willows
were
in
perfect
leaf
and
wore
their
delicate
green
like
veils
caught
upon
their
boughs
the
had
already
pitched
their
tents
in
the
woods
beginning
to
thicken
and
darken
with
the
young
foliage
of
the
oaks
and
hickories
suddenly
as
the
train
dashed
from
a
stretch
of
forest
the
peach
orchards
flushed
pink
beside
the
brick
farmsteads
the
child
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
pointed
and
her
mother
seemed
to
forget
all
that
had
gone
before
and
abandoned
herself
to
flavia
joy
in
the
blossoms
as
if
there
were
no
trouble
for
her
in
the
world
halleck
rose
and
went
into
the
other
car
he
felt
giddy
as
if
her
fluctuations
of
mood
and
motive
had
somehow
turned
his
own
brain
he
did
not
come
back
till
the
train
stopped
at
columbus
for
dinner
the
old
squire
showed
the
same
appetite
as
at
breakfast
he
had
the
effect
of
falling
upon
his
food
like
a
bird
of
prey
and
as
soon
as
the
meal
was
despatched
he
went
back
to
his
seat
in
the
car
where
he
lapsed
into
his
former
silence
and
immobility
his
lank
jaws
working
with
fresh
activity
upon
the
wooden
toothpick
he
had
brought
away
from
the
table
while
they
waited
for
a
train
from
the
north
which
was
to
connect
with
theirs
halleck
walked
up
and
down
the
vast
noisy
station
with
olive
and
marcia
and
humored
the
little
girl
in
her
explorations
of
the
place
she
made
friends
with
a
that
sang
in
its
cage
in
the
and
with
an
old
woman
yellow
and
wrinkled
and
sitting
on
a
bundle
tied
up
in
a
quilt
beside
the
door
and
smoking
her
clay
pipe
as
placidly
as
if
on
her
own
cabin
threshold
like
you
ai
much
afeard
of
strangers
honey
said
the
old
woman
taking
her
pipe
out
of
her
mouth
to
fill
it
where
do
you
live
at
when
you
home
boston
said
the
child
promptly
where
do
live
i
to
live
in
old
virginny
but
my
son
he
takin
me
out
to
illinoy
now
he
settled
out
she
treated
the
child
with
the
serious
equality
which
simple
old
people
use
with
children
and
spat
neatly
aside
in
resuming
her
pipe
which
o
them
ladies
yender
is
your
maw
honey
my
mamma
the
old
woman
nodded
flavia
ran
away
and
laid
her
hand
on
marcia
dress
and
then
ran
back
to
the
old
woman
that
your
paw
with
her
flavia
looked
blank
and
the
old
woman
interpreted
your
no
we
going
out
to
see
papa
out
west
we
going
to
see
him
and
then
he
coming
back
with
us
my
grandpa
is
in
that
the
old
woman
now
laid
her
folded
arms
on
her
knees
and
smoked
obliviously
the
little
girl
lingered
a
moment
and
then
ran
off
laughing
to
her
mother
and
pulled
her
skirt
was
it
funny
mamma
she
thought
halleck
was
my
papa
she
hung
forward
by
the
hold
she
had
taken
as
children
do
and
tilted
her
head
back
to
look
into
her
mother
face
what
halleck
mamma
what
is
he
the
group
halted
involuntarily
yes
what
is
he
is
he
my
uncle
or
my
cousin
or
what
is
going
out
to
see
papa
too
what
is
going
for
oh
look
look
the
child
plucked
away
her
hand
and
ran
off
to
join
the
circle
of
idle
men
and
boys
who
were
forming
about
two
shining
negroes
with
banjos
the
negroes
flung
their
hands
upon
the
strings
with
an
ecstatic
joy
in
the
music
and
lifted
their
black
voices
in
a
wild
plantation
strain
the
child
began
to
leap
and
dance
and
her
mother
ran
after
her
naughty
little
girl
she
cried
come
into
the
car
with
me
this
halleck
did
not
see
marcia
again
till
the
train
had
run
far
out
of
the
city
and
was
again
sweeping
through
the
thick
woods
and
flashing
out
upon
the
levels
of
the
fields
where
the
farmers
were
riding
their
up
and
down
the
long
furrows
in
the
pleasant
afternoon
sun
there
was
something
in
this
transformation
of
man
laborious
dependence
into
a
lordly
domination
over
the
earth
which
strikes
the
westward
journeyer
as
finally
expressive
of
human
destiny
in
the
whole
mighty
region
and
which
penetrated
even
to
halleck
sore
and
jaded
thoughts
a
different
type
of
men
began
to
show
itself
in
the
car
as
the
western
people
gradually
took
the
places
of
his
from
the
east
the
men
were
often
slovenly
and
sometimes
uncouth
in
their
dress
but
they
made
themselves
at
home
in
the
exaggerated
splendor
and
opulence
of
the
car
as
if
born
to
the
best
in
every
way
their
faces
suggested
the
security
of
people
who
trusted
the
future
from
the
past
and
had
no
fears
of
the
life
that
had
always
used
them
well
they
had
not
that
eager
and
intense
look
which
the
eastern
faces
wore
there
was
energy
enough
and
to
spare
in
them
but
it
was
not
an
anxious
energy
the
sharp
accent
of
the
seaboard
yielded
to
the
rounded
soft
and
slurring
tones
and
the
prompt
address
was
replaced
by
a
careless
and
confident
neighborliness
of
manner
flavia
fretted
at
her
return
to
captivity
in
the
car
and
demanded
to
be
released
with
a
teasing
persistence
from
which
nothing
she
was
shown
out
of
the
window
could
divert
her
a
large
man
leaned
forward
at
last
from
a
seat
near
by
and
held
out
an
orange
come
here
to
me
little
trouble
he
said
and
flavia
made
an
eager
start
toward
this
friend
marcia
wished
to
check
her
but
halleck
pleaded
to
have
her
go
it
will
be
a
relief
to
you
he
said
well
let
her
go
marcia
consented
but
she
was
no
trouble
and
she
is
no
she
sat
looking
dully
at
the
little
girl
after
the
westerner
had
gathered
her
up
into
his
lap
should
i
have
liked
to
tell
her
she
said
as
if
thinking
aloud
how
we
were
really
going
to
meet
her
father
and
that
you
were
coming
with
me
to
be
my
witness
against
him
in
a
court
to
put
him
down
and
disgrace
him
to
fight
him
as
father
says
you
must
think
of
it
in
that
way
said
halleck
gently
but
as
he
felt
feebly
and
inadequately
oh
i
shall
not
think
of
it
in
that
way
long
she
answered
my
head
is
in
a
whirl
and
i
ca
hold
what
we
doing
before
my
mind
in
any
one
shape
for
a
minute
at
a
time
i
do
know
what
will
become
of
me
i
know
what
will
become
of
me
but
in
another
breath
she
rose
from
this
desolation
and
was
talking
with
impersonal
cheerfulness
of
the
sights
that
the
showed
as
long
as
the
light
held
they
passed
through
the
same
opulent
and
monotonous
landscape
through
little
towns
full
of
signs
of
material
prosperity
and
then
farms
and
farms
again
the
brick
houses
set
in
the
midst
of
evergreens
and
compassed
by
vast
acreages
of
corn
land
where
herds
of
black
pigs
wandered
and
the
farmers
were
riding
their
ploughs
or
heaping
into
vast
windrows
for
burning
the
stalks
of
the
last
crop
where
they
came
to
a
stream
the
landscape
was
roughened
into
low
hills
from
which
it
sank
again
luxuriously
to
a
plain
if
there
was
any
difference
between
ohio
and
indiana
it
was
that
in
indiana
the
spring
night
whose
breath
softly
buffeted
their
cheeks
through
the
open
window
had
gathered
over
those
eternal
cornfields
where
the
long
crooked
windrows
burning
on
either
hand
seemed
a
trail
of
fiery
serpents
writhing
away
from
the
train
as
it
roared
and
clamored
over
the
track
they
were
to
leave
their
car
at
indianapolis
and
take
another
road
which
would
bring
them
to
tecumseh
by
daylight
the
next
morning
olive
went
away
with
the
little
girl
and
put
her
to
bed
on
the
sofa
in
their
and
marcia
suffered
them
to
go
alone
it
was
only
by
fits
that
she
had
cared
for
the
child
or
even
noticed
it
now
tell
me
again
she
said
to
halleck
why
we
are
surely
you
yes
yes
i
know
but
i
ca
think
i
do
seem
to
remember
did
i
give
it
up
once
did
i
say
that
i
would
rather
go
home
and
let
bartley
get
the
divorce
if
he
wanted
yes
you
said
that
i
used
to
make
him
very
unhappy
i
was
very
strict
with
him
when
i
knew
he
could
bear
any
kind
of
strictness
and
he
was
always
so
patient
with
me
though
he
never
really
cared
for
me
oh
yes
i
knew
that
from
the
first
he
used
to
try
but
he
must
have
been
glad
to
get
away
poor
bartley
it
was
cruel
cruel
to
put
that
in
about
my
abandoning
him
when
he
knew
i
would
come
back
but
perhaps
the
lawyers
told
him
he
must
he
had
to
put
in
something
why
should
i
let
him
go
father
said
he
only
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me
so
that
he
could
marry
some
one
else
yes
yes
it
was
that
that
made
me
start
father
knew
it
would
oh
she
grieved
with
a
wild
that
tore
halleck
heart
he
knew
it
would
she
fell
wearily
back
against
the
seat
and
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
then
she
said
in
a
slow
broken
utterance
but
now
i
do
seem
to
mind
even
that
any
more
why
should
he
marry
some
one
else
that
he
really
likes
if
he
does
care
for
me
halleck
laughed
in
bitterness
of
soul
as
his
thought
recurred
to
reasons
because
he
said
you
have
a
duty
in
the
matter
you
must
keep
him
bound
to
you
for
fear
some
other
woman
whose
husband
does
care
for
her
should
let
go
too
and
society
be
broken
up
and
civilization
destroyed
in
a
matter
like
this
which
seems
to
concern
yourself
alone
you
are
only
to
regard
his
reckless
irony
did
not
reach
her
through
her
manifold
sorrow
well
she
said
simply
it
must
be
that
but
oh
how
can
i
bear
it
how
can
i
bear
it
the
time
passed
olive
did
not
return
for
an
hour
then
she
merely
said
that
the
little
girl
had
just
fallen
asleep
and
that
she
should
go
back
and
lie
down
with
her
that
she
was
sleepy
too
marcia
did
not
answer
but
halleck
said
he
would
call
her
in
good
time
before
they
reached
indianapolis
the
porter
made
up
the
berths
of
such
as
were
going
through
to
louis
and
marcia
was
left
sitting
alone
with
halleck
i
will
go
and
get
your
father
to
come
here
he
said
i
do
want
him
to
come
i
want
to
talk
to
you
to
say
something
what
was
it
i
ca
think
she
stopped
like
one
trying
to
recover
a
faded
thought
he
waited
but
she
did
not
speak
again
she
had
laid
a
nervous
clutch
upon
his
arm
to
detain
him
from
going
for
her
father
and
she
kept
her
hand
there
mechanically
but
after
a
while
he
felt
it
relax
she
drooped
against
him
and
fell
away
into
a
sleep
in
which
she
started
now
and
then
like
a
frightened
child
he
could
not
release
himself
without
waking
her
but
it
did
not
matter
her
sorrow
had
unsexed
her
only
the
tenderness
of
his
love
for
this
hapless
soul
remained
in
his
heart
which
ached
and
evermore
heavily
sank
within
him
he
woke
her
at
last
when
he
must
go
to
tell
olive
that
they
were
running
into
indianapolis
marcia
struggled
to
her
feet
oh
oh
are
we
there
are
we
there
we
are
at
indianapolis
said
halleck
i
thought
it
was
tecumseh
she
shuddered
we
can
go
back
oh
yes
we
can
still
go
back
they
alighted
from
the
train
in
the
chilly
midnight
air
and
found
their
way
through
the
crowd
to
the
of
the
station
the
little
girl
cried
with
broken
sleep
and
the
strangeness
and
olive
tried
to
quiet
her
marcia
clung
to
halleck
arm
and
shivered
convulsively
squire
gaylord
stalked
beside
them
with
a
demoniac
vigor
a
few
more
hours
a
few
more
hours
sir
he
said
he
made
a
hearty
supper
while
the
rest
scalded
their
mouths
with
hot
tea
which
they
forced
with
loathing
to
their
lips
some
women
who
were
washing
the
floor
of
the
ladies
told
them
they
must
go
into
the
men
room
and
wait
there
for
their
train
which
was
due
at
one
they
obeyed
and
found
the
room
full
of
emigrants
and
the
air
thick
with
their
tobacco
smoke
there
was
no
choice
olive
went
in
first
and
took
the
child
on
her
lap
where
it
straightway
fell
asleep
the
squire
found
a
seat
beside
them
and
sat
erect
looking
round
on
the
emigrants
with
the
air
of
being
amused
at
their
outlandish
speech
into
which
they
burst
clamorously
from
their
silence
at
intervals
marcia
stopped
halleck
at
the
threshold
stay
out
here
with
me
she
whispered
i
want
to
tell
you
something
she
added
as
he
turned
mechanically
and
walked
away
with
her
up
the
vast
darkness
of
the
depot
am
not
going
i
am
going
back
we
will
take
the
train
that
goes
to
the
east
father
will
never
know
till
it
is
too
late
we
need
speak
to
him
about
it
halleck
set
himself
against
this
delirious
folly
he
consented
to
her
return
she
could
do
what
she
would
but
he
would
not
consent
to
cheat
her
father
we
must
go
and
tell
him
he
said
for
all
answer
to
all
her
entreaties
he
dragged
her
back
to
the
but
at
the
door
she
started
at
the
figure
of
a
man
who
was
bending
over
a
group
of
emigrant
children
asleep
in
the
nearest
corner
poor
uncouth
stubbed
little
creatures
in
clothes
looking
like
children
roughly
blocked
out
of
wood
and
stiffly
stretched
on
the
floor
or
resting
woodenly
against
their
mother
there
said
the
man
pressing
a
mug
of
coffee
on
the
woman
you
drink
that
it
do
you
good
every
drop
of
it
i
seen
the
time
he
said
turning
round
with
the
mug
when
she
had
drained
it
in
his
hand
and
addressing
marcia
and
halleck
as
the
most
accessible
portion
of
the
public
when
i
used
to
be
down
on
coffee
i
thought
it
was
bad
for
the
nerves
but
i
tell
you
when
you
travelling
it
a
if
ever
there
was
a
brain
he
dropped
the
mug
and
stumbled
back
into
the
heap
of
sleeping
children
fixing
a
ghastly
stare
on
marcia
she
ran
toward
him
mr
kinney
no
you
do
no
you
do
why
do
you
know
me
hubbard
he
he
told
me
you
was
dead
roared
kinney
he
told
you
i
was
dead
a
year
ago
the
last
time
i
seen
him
before
i
went
out
to
leadville
he
told
you
i
was
dead
repeated
marcia
huskily
he
must
have
wished
it
she
whispered
oh
mercy
mercy
mercy
she
stopped
and
then
she
broke
into
a
wild
laugh
well
you
see
he
was
wrong
i
on
my
way
to
him
now
to
show
him
that
i
alive
xl
halleck
woke
at
daybreak
from
the
drowse
into
which
he
had
fallen
the
train
was
creeping
slowly
over
the
track
feeling
its
way
and
he
heard
fragments
of
talk
among
the
passengers
about
a
broken
rail
that
the
conductor
had
been
warned
of
he
turned
to
ask
some
question
when
the
pull
of
rising
speed
came
from
the
locomotive
and
at
the
same
moment
the
car
stopped
with
a
jolting
pitch
it
settled
upon
the
track
again
but
the
two
cars
in
front
were
overturned
and
the
passengers
were
still
climbing
from
their
windows
when
halleck
got
his
bewildered
party
to
the
ground
children
were
crying
and
a
woman
was
led
by
with
her
face
cut
and
bleeding
from
the
broken
glass
but
it
was
reported
that
no
one
else
was
hurt
and
the
trainmen
gave
their
helplessness
to
the
inspection
of
the
rotten
that
had
caused
the
accident
one
of
the
passengers
kicked
the
decayed
wood
with
his
boot
well
he
said
i
always
like
a
little
accident
like
this
early
it
makes
us
safe
the
rest
of
the
the
sentiment
apparently
commended
itself
to
popular
acceptance
halleck
went
forward
with
part
of
the
crowd
to
see
what
was
the
matter
with
the
locomotive
it
had
kept
the
track
but
seemed
to
be
injured
somehow
the
engineer
was
working
at
it
hammer
in
hand
he
exchanged
some
dry
pleasantries
with
a
passenger
who
asked
him
if
there
was
any
chance
of
hiring
a
real
fast
in
that
neighborhood
in
case
a
man
was
in
a
hurry
to
get
on
to
tecumseh
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
level
prairie
that
stretched
all
round
to
the
horizon
where
it
was
broken
by
patches
of
timber
the
rising
sun
slanted
across
the
green
expanse
and
turned
its
distance
to
gold
the
grass
at
their
feet
was
full
of
upon
which
flavia
flung
herself
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
the
car
by
the
time
halleck
returned
to
them
she
was
running
with
cries
of
joy
and
wonder
toward
a
windmill
that
rose
beautiful
above
the
roofs
of
a
group
of
commonplace
houses
at
a
little
distance
from
the
track
it
stirred
its
mighty
vans
in
the
thin
sweet
inland
breeze
and
took
the
sun
gayly
on
the
light
gallery
that
encircled
it
a
vision
of
belgian
plains
swept
before
halleck
eyes
there
ought
to
be
storks
on
its
roof
he
said
absently
how
strange
that
it
should
be
here
away
out
in
the
west
said
olive
if
it
were
less
strange
than
we
are
here
i
could
stand
it
he
answered
a
brakeman
came
up
with
a
flag
in
his
hand
and
nodded
toward
flavia
she
on
the
right
track
for
breakfast
he
said
there
an
old
dutchman
at
that
mill
and
his
wife
knows
how
to
make
coffee
like
a
fellow
mother
you
have
plenty
of
time
this
train
has
come
here
to
till
somebody
can
walk
back
five
miles
and
telegraph
for
how
far
are
we
from
tecumseh
asked
halleck
fifty
miles
the
brakeman
called
back
over
his
shoulder
do
you
worry
any
marcia
said
her
father
moving
off
in
pursuit
of
flavia
this
accident
makes
it
all
right
for
us
if
we
do
get
there
for
a
marcia
answered
nothing
halleck
began
to
talk
to
her
of
that
belgian
landscape
in
which
he
had
first
seen
a
windmill
and
he
laughed
at
the
blank
unintelligence
with
which
she
received
his
reminiscences
of
travel
for
the
moment
the
torturing
stress
was
lifted
from
his
soul
he
wished
that
the
breakfast
in
the
miller
house
might
never
come
to
an
end
he
explored
the
mill
with
flavia
he
bantered
the
squire
on
his
saturnine
preference
for
steam
power
in
the
milling
business
he
made
the
others
share
his
mood
he
pushed
far
from
him
the
series
of
tragic
or
squalid
facts
which
had
continually
brought
the
end
to
him
in
reveries
in
which
he
found
himself
holding
his
breath
as
if
he
might
hold
it
till
the
end
really
came
but
this
respite
could
not
last
a
puff
of
white
steam
showed
on
the
horizon
and
after
an
interval
the
sound
of
the
locomotive
whistle
reached
them
as
it
came
backing
down
a
train
of
empty
cars
towards
them
they
were
quickly
on
their
journey
again
and
a
scanty
hour
before
noon
they
arrived
at
tecumseh
the
pretty
town
which
in
prospect
had
worn
to
olive
halleck
imagination
the
blended
hideousness
of
sodom
and
gomorrah
was
certainly
very
much
more
like
a
new
england
village
in
fact
after
the
brick
farmsteads
and
towns
of
central
ohio
its
wooden
houses
set
back
from
the
street
with
an
ample
depth
of
were
appealingly
familiar
and
she
exchanged
some
homesick
whispers
with
marcia
about
them
as
they
drove
along
under
the
maples
which
shadowed
the
way
the
grass
was
denser
and
darker
than
in
new
england
and
pretty
as
the
town
was
it
wore
a
more
careless
and
unscrupulous
air
than
the
true
new
england
village
the
south
had
touched
it
and
here
and
there
it
showed
a
wavering
line
of
fence
and
a
faltering
conscientiousness
in
its
paint
presently
all
aspects
of
village
quiet
and
seclusion
ceased
and
a
section
of
conventional
american
city
with
brick
blocks
showy
hotel
stores
paved
street
and
stone
sidewalks
expressed
the
readiness
of
tecumseh
to
fulfil
the
destiny
of
every
western
town
and
become
a
metropolis
at
a
day
notice
if
need
be
the
omnibus
which
reflected
the
actuality
of
tecumseh
set
them
down
at
the
broad
steps
of
the
fronting
on
an
avenue
which
for
a
city
street
was
not
very
crowded
or
busy
such
passers
as
there
were
had
leisure
and
inclination
as
they
loitered
by
to
turn
and
stare
at
the
strangers
and
the
voice
of
the
sheriff
as
he
called
from
an
upper
window
of
the
the
names
of
absentee
litigants
or
witnesses
required
to
come
into
court
easily
made
itself
heard
above
all
the
other
noises
it
seemed
to
halleck
as
if
the
sheriff
were
calling
them
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
olive
but
she
would
not
meet
his
eye
she
led
by
the
hand
the
little
girl
who
kept
asking
is
this
the
house
where
papa
lives
with
the
merciless
iteration
of
a
child
halleck
dragged
lamely
after
the
squire
who
had
mounted
the
steps
with
unnatural
vigor
he
promptly
found
his
way
to
the
clerk
office
where
he
examined
the
docket
and
then
returned
to
his
party
triumphant
we
are
in
time
he
said
and
he
led
them
on
up
into
the
a
few
spectators
scattered
about
on
the
rows
of
benching
turned
to
look
at
them
as
they
walked
up
the
aisle
where
the
cocoa
matting
soaked
and
dried
and
soaked
again
with
perpetual
libations
of
mercifully
silenced
their
footsteps
most
of
the
faces
turned
upon
them
showed
a
slow
and
thoughtful
movement
of
the
jaws
and
as
they
were
dropped
or
averted
a
general
discharge
of
seemed
to
express
the
general
adoption
of
the
whoever
they
were
as
a
necessary
element
of
the
scene
which
it
was
useless
to
oppose
and
about
which
it
was
idle
to
speculate
before
the
squire
had
found
his
party
seats
on
one
of
the
benches
next
the
bar
the
spectators
had
again
given
their
languid
attention
to
the
administration
of
justice
which
is
everywhere
informal
with
us
and
is
only
a
little
more
informal
in
the
west
than
in
the
east
an
effect
of
serene
disoccupation
pervaded
the
place
such
as
comes
at
the
termination
of
an
interesting
affair
and
no
one
seemed
to
care
for
what
the
clerk
was
reading
aloud
in
a
set
mechanical
tone
the
judge
was
busy
with
his
docket
the
lawyers
at
their
several
little
tables
within
the
bar
lounged
in
their
chairs
or
stalked
about
laughing
and
whispering
to
each
other
the
prosecuting
attorney
leaned
upon
the
shoulder
of
a
man
who
lifted
his
face
to
joke
up
at
him
as
he
tilted
his
chair
back
a
very
stout
youngish
person
who
sat
next
him
kept
his
face
dropped
while
the
clerk
proceeded
and
now
on
motion
of
plaintiff
it
is
ordered
by
the
court
that
said
defendant
be
now
here
three
times
called
which
is
done
in
open
court
and
she
comes
not
but
wholly
makes
default
herein
and
this
cause
is
now
submitted
to
the
court
for
trial
and
the
court
having
heard
the
evidence
and
being
fully
advised
find
for
the
plaintiff
that
the
allegations
of
his
complaint
are
true
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
divorce
it
is
therefore
considered
by
the
court
that
said
plaintiff
be
and
he
is
hereby
divorced
and
the
bonds
of
matrimony
heretofore
existing
between
said
parties
are
dissolved
and
held
for
as
the
clerk
closed
the
large
volume
before
him
the
jolly
lawyer
as
if
the
record
had
been
read
at
his
request
nodded
to
the
court
and
said
the
record
of
the
decree
seems
correct
your
he
leaned
forward
and
struck
the
fat
man
expanse
of
back
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
congratulate
you
my
dear
boy
he
said
in
a
stage
whisper
that
was
heard
through
the
room
many
happy
returns
of
the
day
a
laugh
went
round
and
the
judge
said
severely
mr
sheriff
see
that
order
is
kept
in
the
the
fat
man
rose
to
shake
hands
with
another
friend
and
at
the
same
moment
squire
gaylord
stretched
himself
to
his
full
height
before
stooping
over
to
touch
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
lawyers
within
the
bar
and
his
eyes
encountered
those
of
bartley
hubbard
in
mutual
recognition
it
was
not
the
fat
on
bartley
ribs
only
that
had
increased
his
broad
cheeks
stood
out
and
hung
down
with
it
and
his
chin
descended
by
the
three
successive
steps
to
his
breast
his
complexion
was
of
a
tender
pink
on
which
his
blonde
moustache
showed
white
it
almost
vanished
in
the
tallowy
pallor
to
which
the
pink
turned
as
he
saw
his
and
then
the
whole
group
which
the
intervening
spectators
had
hitherto
hidden
from
him
he
dropped
back
into
his
chair
and
intimated
to
his
lawyer
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
a
twist
of
his
head
that
some
hopeless
turn
in
his
fortunes
had
taken
place
that
jolly
soul
turned
to
him
for
explanation
and
at
the
same
time
the
lawyer
whom
squire
gaylord
had
touched
on
the
shoulder
responded
to
a
few
whispered
words
from
him
by
beckoning
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
stepped
briskly
across
to
where
they
stood
a
brief
ensued
and
the
prosecutor
ended
by
taking
the
squire
hand
and
inviting
him
within
the
bar
the
other
attorney
politely
made
room
for
him
at
his
table
and
the
prosecutor
returned
to
his
place
near
the
where
he
remained
standing
for
a
moment
if
it
please
the
court
he
began
in
a
voice
breaking
heavily
upon
the
silence
that
had
somehow
fallen
upon
the
whole
room
i
wish
to
state
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
of
hubbard
hubbard
is
now
and
here
present
having
been
prevented
by
an
accident
on
the
road
between
this
place
and
indianapolis
from
arriving
in
time
to
make
defence
she
desires
to
move
the
court
to
set
aside
the
the
prosecutor
retired
a
few
paces
and
nodded
triumphantly
at
lawyer
who
could
not
wholly
suppress
his
enjoyment
of
the
joke
though
it
told
so
heavily
against
him
and
his
client
but
he
was
instantly
on
his
feet
with
a
technical
objection
the
judge
heard
him
through
and
then
opened
his
docket
at
the
case
of
hubbard
hubbard
what
name
shall
i
enter
for
the
defence
he
inquired
formally
squire
gaylord
turned
with
an
state
and
deliberation
which
had
their
effect
and
cast
a
glance
of
professional
satisfaction
in
the
situation
at
the
attorneys
and
the
spectators
i
ask
to
be

in
this
case
if
the
court
please
my
friend
hathaway
will
move
my
admission
to
this
the
attorney
to
whom
the
squire
had
first
introduced
himself
promptly
complied
your
honor
i
move
the
admission
of
gaylord
of
equity
equity
county
maine
to
practise
at
this
the
judge
bowed
to
the
squire
and
directed
the
clerk
to
administer
the
usual
oath
i
have
entered
your
name
for
the
defence
gaylord
do
you
desire
to
make
any
motion
in
the
case
he
pursued
the
natural
courtesy
of
his
manner
further
qualified
by
a
feeling
which
something
pathetic
in
the
old
squire
bearing
inspired
yes
your
honor
i
move
to
set
aside
the
default
and
i
shall
offer
in
support
of
this
motion
my
affidavit
setting
forth
the
reasons
for
the
of
the
defendant
at
the
calling
of
the
shall
i
note
your
motion
as
filed
asked
the
judge
yes
your
honor
replied
the
old
man
he
made
a
futile
attempt
to
prepare
the
paper
the
pen
flew
out
of
his
trembling
hand
ca
write
he
said
in
despair
that
made
other
hands
quick
to
aid
him
a
young
lawyer
at
the
next
desk
rapidly
drew
up
the
paper
and
the
squire
duly
offered
it
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
the
clerk
stamped
it
with
the
of
the
court
and
returned
it
to
the
squire
who
read
aloud
the
motion
and
affidavit
setting
forth
the
facts
of
the
defendant
failure
to
receive
the
notice
in
time
to
prepare
for
her
defence
and
of
the
accident
which
had
contributed
to
delay
her
appearance
declaring
that
she
had
a
just
defence
to
the
plaintiff
bill
and
asking
to
be
heard
upon
the
facts
bartley
attorney
was
prompt
to
interpose
again
he
protested
that
the
printed
advertisement
was
sufficient
notice
to
the
defendant
whenever
it
came
to
her
knowledge
or
even
if
it
never
came
to
her
knowledge
and
that
her
plea
of
failure
to
receive
it
in
time
was
not
a
competent
excuse
this
might
be
alleged
in
any
case
and
any
delay
of
travel
might
be
brought
forward
to
account
for
as
plausibly
as
this
accident
in
which
nobody
was
hurt
he
did
his
best
which
was
also
his
worst
and
the
judge
once
more
addressed
the
squire
who
stood
waiting
for
bartley
counsel
to
close
i
was
about
to
adjourn
the
court
said
the
judge
in
that
accent
which
is
the
gift
of
the
south
to
some
parts
of
the
west
it
is
curiously
soft
and
gentle
and
expressive
when
the
speaker
will
of
a
caressing
deference
but
we
have
still
some
minutes
before
noon
in
which
we
can
hear
you
in
support
of
your
motion
if
you
are
i
am
your
honor
the
old
man
nasals
cut
across
the
rounded
tones
almost
before
they
had
ceased
his
lips
compressed
themselves
to
a
waving
line
and
his
high
came
down
over
them
the
fierce
light
burned
in
his
cavernous
eyes
and
his
grizzled
hair
erected
itself
like
a
crest
he
swayed
slightly
back
and
forth
at
the
table
behind
which
he
stood
and
paused
as
if
waiting
for
his
hate
to
gather
head
in
this
interval
it
struck
several
of
the
spectators
who
had
appreciative
friends
outside
that
it
was
a
pity
they
should
miss
the
coming
music
and
they
risked
the
loss
of
some
strains
themselves
that
they
might
step
out
and
inform
these
one
of
them
was
stopped
by
a
man
at
the
door
what
up
now
the
other
impatiently
explained
but
the
inquirer
instead
of
hurrying
in
to
enjoy
the
fun
turned
quickly
about
and
ran
down
the
stairs
he
crossed
the
street
and
by
a
system
of
alleys
and
byways
modestly
made
his
way
to
the
outlying
fields
of
tecumseh
which
he
traversed
at
heightened
speed
plunging
at
last
into
the
belt
of
timber
beyond
this
excursion
which
had
so
much
the
appearance
of
a
chase
was
an
exigency
of
the
witness
who
had
corroborated
on
oath
the
testimony
of
bartley
in
regard
to
his
wife
desertion
such
an
establishment
of
facts
purely
imaginary
with
the
witness
was
simple
enough
in
the
absence
of
rebutting
testimony
but
confronted
with
this
it
became
another
affair
it
had
its
embarrassments
its
risks
repeated
squire
gay
lord
with
facts
and
the
word
in
which
he
exulted
till
it
rang
and
echoed
through
the
room
drew
the
eyes
of
all
to
the
little
group
on
the
bench
next
the
bar
where
marcia
heavily
veiled
in
the
black
which
she
had
worn
ever
since
disappearance
sat
with
halleck
and
olive
the
little
girl
spent
with
her
long
journey
rested
her
head
on
her
mother
lap
and
the
mother
hand
tremulously
smoothed
her
hair
and
tried
to
hush
the
grieving
whisper
in
which
she
incessantly
repeated
where
is
papa
i
want
to
see
papa
olive
looked
straight
before
her
and
halleck
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
floor
after
the
first
glance
at
them
bartley
did
not
lift
his
head
but
held
it
bent
forward
where
he
sat
and
showed
only
a
fold
of
fat
red
neck
above
his
marcia
might
have
seen
his
face
in
that
moment
before
it
blanched
and
he
sank
into
his
chair
she
did
not
look
toward
him
again
mr
sheriff
keep
silence
in
the
court
ordered
the
judge
in
reprimand
of
the
stir
that
ensued
upon
the
general
effort
to
catch
sight
of
the
witnesses
silence
in
the
court
keep
your
seats
gentlemen
cried
the
sheriff
and
i
thank
the
court
resumed
the
squire
for
this
immediate
opportunity
to
redress
an
atrocious
wrong
and
to
vindicate
an
innocent
and
injured
woman
sir
i
think
it
will
prejudice
our
cause
with
no
one
when
i
say
that
we
are
here
not
only
in
the
relation
of
attorney
and
client
but
in
that
of
father
and
daughter
and
that
i
stand
in
this
place
singularly
and
sacredly
privileged
to
demand
justice
for
my
own
child
order
order
shouted
the
sheriff
but
he
could
not
quell
the
sensation
that
followed
the
point
had
been
effectively
made
and
it
was
some
moments
before
the
noise
of
the
people
beginning
to
arrive
from
the
outside
permitted
the
squire
to
continue
he
waited
with
one
lean
hand
hanging
at
his
side
and
the
other
resting
in
a
loosely
folded
fist
on
the
table
before
him
he
took
this
fist
up
as
if
it
were
some
implement
he
had
laid
hold
of
and
swung
it
in
the
air
by
a
chance
which
shall
not
be
the
last
to
describe
as
providential
he
paused
and
looked
round
the
room
as
if
defying
any
one
there
to
challenge
the
sincerity
of
his
assertion
the
notice
which
your
law
requires
to
be
given
by
newspaper
advertisement
to
the
defendant
in
such
a
case
as
this
came
by
one
chance
in
millions
to
her
hand
by
one
chance
more
or
less
it
would
not
have
reached
her
and
a
monstrous
crime
against
justice
would
have
been
irrevocably
accomplished
for
she
had
mourned
this
man
as
dead
dead
to
the
universal
frame
of
things
when
he
was
only
dead
to
honor
dead
to
duty
and
dead
to
her
and
it
was
that
newspaper
sent
almost
at
random
through
the
mail
and
wandering
from
hand
to
hand
and
everywhere
rejected
for
weeks
before
it
reached
her
at
last
which
convinced
her
that
he
was
still
in
such
life
as
a
man
may
live
who
has
survived
his
own
soul
we
are
therefore
standing
upon
our
right
and
prepared
to
prove
it
god
right
and
the
everlasting
truth
two
days
ago
a
thousand
miles
and
a
thousand
uncertainties
intervened
between
us
and
this
right
but
we
are
here
to
show
that
the
defendant
basely
defamed
by
the
plea
of
abandonment
returned
to
her
home
within
an
hour
after
she
had
parted
there
with
the
plaintiff
and
has
remained
there
day
and
night
ever
he
stopped
did
i
say
she
had
never
absented
herself
during
all
this
time
i
was
wrong
i
spoke
hastily
i
he
dropped
his
voice
she
did
absent
herself
at
one
time
for
three
days
while
she
could
come
home
to
close
her
mother
dying
eyes
and
help
me
to
lay
her
in
the
grave
he
tried
to
close
his
lips
firmly
again
but
the
sinuous
line
was
broken
by
a
convulsive
twitching
perhaps
he
resumed
with
the
utmost
gentleness
the
plaintiff
returned
in
this
interval
and
finding
her
gone
was
confirmed
in
his
belief
that
she
had
abandoned
he
felt
blindly
about
on
the
table
with
his
trembling
hands
and
his
whole
figure
had
a
pathos
that
gave
the
old
statuesque
dignity
the
spectators
quietly
changed
their
places
and
occupied
the
benches
near
him
till
bartley
was
left
sitting
alone
with
his
counsel
we
are
beginning
to
talk
here
at
the
east
of
the
decline
of
oratory
but
it
is
still
a
passion
in
the
west
and
his
listeners
now
clustered
about
the
squire
in
keen
appreciation
of
his
power
it
seemed
to
summon
even
the
loiterers
in
the
street
whose
ascending
tramp
on
the
stairs
continually
made
itself
heard
the
lawyers
the
officers
of
the
court
the
judge
forgot
their
dinner
and
posed
themselves
anew
in
their
chairs
to
listen
no
doubt
the
electrical
sphere
of
sympathy
and
admiration
penetrated
to
the
old
man
consciousness
when
he
pulled
off
his
black
satin
stock
the
relic
of
ancient
fashion
which
the
piety
of
his
daughter
kept
in
repair
and
laid
it
on
the
table
there
was
a
deep
inarticulate
murmur
of
satisfaction
which
he
could
not
have
mistaken
his
voice
rose
again
if
the
plaintiff
indeed
came
at
that
time
the
walls
of
those
empty
rooms
into
which
he
peered
like
a
thief
in
the
night
might
have
told
him
if
walls
had
tongues
to
speak
as
they
have
ears
to
hear
a
tale
that
would
have
melted
even
heart
with
remorse
and
shame
they
might
have
told
him
of
a
woman
waiting
in
hunger
and
cold
for
his
return
and
willing
to
starve
and
freeze
rather
than
own
herself
forsaken
waiting
till
she
was
hunted
from
her
door
by
the
creditors
whom
he
had
defrauded
and
forced
to
confess
her
disgrace
and
her
despair
in
order
to
save
herself
from
the
unknown
terrors
of
the
law
invoked
upon
her
innocent
head
by
his
villany
this
is
the
history
of
the
first
two
weeks
of
those
two
years
during
which
as
his
perjured
lips
have
sworn
he
was
using
every
effort
to
secure
her
return
to
him
i
will
not
enlarge
now
upon
this
history
nor
upon
that
of
the
days
and
weeks
and
months
that
followed
wringing
the
heart
and
all
but
crazing
the
brain
of
the
wife
who
would
not
in
the
darkest
hours
of
her
desolation
believe
herself
wilfully
abandoned
but
we
have
the
record
unbroken
and
irrefragable
which
shall
not
only
right
his
victim
but
shall
bring
yonder
perjurer
to
the
words
had
an
iron
weight
they
fell
like
blows
bartley
did
not
stir
but
marcia
moved
uneasily
in
her
chair
and
a
low
pitiful
murmur
broke
from
behind
her
veil
her
father
stopped
again
panting
and
his
dry
lips
closed
and
parted
several
times
before
he
could
find
his
voice
again
but
at
that
sound
of
grief
he
partially
recovered
himself
and
went
on
brokenly
i
now
ask
this
court
for
due
cause
to
set
aside
the
default
upon
which
judgment
has
been
rendered
against
the
defendant
and
i
shall
then
ask
leave
to
file
her
for
marcia
started
from
her
chair
and
then
fell
back
again
she
looked
round
at
halleck
as
if
for
help
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
her
father
cast
a
glance
at
her
as
if
for
her
approval
of
this
development
of
his
plan
then
may
it
please
the
court
upon
the
rendition
of
judgment
in
our
favor
upon
that
petition
a
result
of
which
i
have
no
more
doubt
than
of
my
own
existence
i
shall
demand
under
your
law
the
indictment
of
yonder
perjurer
for
his
crime
and
i
shall
await
in
security
the
sentence
which
shall
consign
him
to
a
felon
cell
in
a
felon
garb
marcia
flung
herself
upon
her
father
arm
outstretched
toward
bartley
no
no
no
she
cried
with
deep
shuddering
breaths
in
a
voice
thick
with
horror
never
let
him
go
i
will
not
have
it
i
did
understand
i
never
meant
to
harm
him
let
him
go
it
is
cause
and
i
say
the
old
man
arm
dropped
he
fixed
a
ghastly
bewildered
look
upon
his
daughter
and
fell
forward
across
the
table
at
which
he
stood
the
judge
started
from
his
chair
the
people
leaped
over
the
benches
and
crushed
about
the
squire
who
fetched
his
breath
in
convulsive
gasps
keep
back
give
him
air
open
the
window
get
a
doctor
cried
those
next
him
even
bartley
counsel
had
joined
the
crowd
about
the
squire
from
the
midst
of
which
broke
the
long
frightened
wail
of
a
child
this
was
bartley
opportunity
when
his
counsel
turned
to
look
for
him
and
advise
his
withdrawal
from
a
place
where
he
could
do
no
good
and
where
possibly
he
might
come
to
harm
he
found
that
his
advice
had
been
anticipated
bartley
chair
was
vacant
xli
that
night
when
halleck
had
left
the
old
man
to
the
care
of
marcia
and
olive
for
the
time
a
note
was
brought
to
him
from
bartley
lawyer
begging
the
favor
of
a
few
moments
interview
on
very
important
business
it
might
be
some
offer
of
reparation
or
advance
in
marcia
interest
and
halleck
went
with
the
bearer
of
the
note
the
lawyer
met
him
hospitably
at
the
door
of
his
office
how
do
you
do
sir
he
said
shaking
hands
then
he
indicated
a
bulk
withdrawn
into
a
corner
of
the
room
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
he
locked
the
door
after
halleck
entrance
mr
hubbard
whom
i
think
you
know
he
added
i
just
step
into
the
next
room
gentlemen
and
will
be
subject
to
your
call
at
any
the
bulk
lifted
itself
and
moved
some
paces
toward
halleck
bartley
even
raised
his
hand
with
the
vague
expectation
of
taking
halleck
but
seeing
no
responsive
gesture
on
his
part
he
waved
a
salutation
and
dropped
it
again
to
his
side
how
d
ye
do
halleck
rather
a
secret
black
and
midnight
interview
he
said
jocosely
but
i
could
very
well
manage
it
otherwise
i
just
in
the
position
to
offer
you
the
freedom
of
the
what
do
you
want
hubbard
asked
halleck
bluntly
how
is
the
old
squire
the
doctor
thinks
he
may
rally
from
the
paralysis
i
have
spent
the
day
in
the
timber
as
our
friends
out
here
say
communing
with
nature
and
i
only
just
come
into
town
since
dark
so
i
had
any
he
paused
as
if
expecting
that
halleck
might
give
them
but
upon
his
remaining
silent
he
resumed
of
course
as
the
case
now
stands
i
know
very
well
that
the
law
ca
touch
me
but
i
did
know
what
the
popular
feeling
might
be
the
squire
laid
it
on
pretty
hot
and
he
might
have
made
it
livelier
for
me
than
he
intended
he
is
aware
of
the
inflammable
nature
of
the
material
out
he
gave
a
nervous
chuckle
i
wanted
to
see
you
halleck
to
tell
you
that
i
have
forgotten
that
money
i
owe
you
and
that
i
mean
to
pay
it
all
up
some
time
yet
if
it
been
for
some
expenses
i
had
lately
doctor
bills
and
so
forth
i
have
been
very
well
myself
he
made
a
sort
of
involuntary
appeal
for
halleck
sympathy
and
i
had
to
pay
out
a
good
deal
of
money
i
should
be
able
to
pay
most
of
it
now
as
it
is
i
can
only
give
you
five
hundred
of
he
tugged
his
with
difficulty
up
the
slope
of
his
pantaloons
that
will
leave
me
just
three
hundred
to
begin
the
world
with
for
of
course
i
got
to
clear
out
of
here
and
i
got
very
comfortably
settled
after
two
years
of
pretty
hard
work
at
the
printing
business
and
hard
reading
at
the
law
well
it
all
right
and
i
want
to
pay
you
this
money
now
and
i
pay
you
the
rest
whenever
i
can
and
i
want
you
to
tell
marcia
that
i
did
it
i
always
meant
to
do
hubbard
interrupted
halleck
you
do
owe
me
any
money
your
paid
that
debt
two
years
ago
but
you
owe
some
one
else
a
debt
that
no
one
can
pay
for
you
we
need
waste
words
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
repair
the
wrong
you
have
done
the
woman
and
the
child
he
stopped
the
effort
had
perhaps
been
too
much
bartley
saw
his
emotion
and
in
his
benighted
way
he
honored
it
halleck
you
are
a
good
fellow
you
are
a
good
fellow
that
you
understand
this
thing
but
it
played
out
i
felt
badly
about
it
myself
at
one
time
and
if
i
had
been
robbed
of
that
money
you
lent
me
on
my
way
here
i
have
gone
back
inside
of
hours
i
was
sorry
for
marcia
it
almost
broke
my
heart
to
think
of
the
little
one
but
i
knew
they
were
in
the
hands
of
friends
and
the
more
time
i
had
to
think
it
over
the
more
i
was
reconciled
to
what
i
had
done
that
was
the
only
way
out
for
either
of
us
we
had
tried
it
for
three
years
and
we
make
it
go
we
never
could
have
made
it
go
we
were
incompatible
you
suppose
i
knew
marcia
good
qualities
no
one
knows
them
better
or
appreciates
them
more
you
might
think
that
i
applied
for
this
divorce
because
i
had
some
one
else
in
view
not
any
more
in
mine
at
present
but
i
thought
we
ought
to
be
free
both
of
us
and
if
our
marriage
had
become
a
chain
that
we
ought
to
break
bartley
paused
apparently
to
give
these
facts
and
reasons
time
to
sink
into
halleck
mind
but
there
one
thing
i
should
like
to
have
you
tell
her
halleck
she
was
wrong
about
that
girl
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
her
marcia
will
halleck
made
no
reply
and
bartley
resumed
in
a
burst
of
generosity
which
marked
his
fall
into
the
abyss
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
look
here
halleck
ca
marry
again
for
two
years
but
as
i
understand
the
law
marcia
is
bound
in
any
way
i
know
that
she
always
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
you
and
that
she
thinks
you
are
the
best
man
in
the
world
why
do
fix
it
up
with
marcia
bartley
was
in
effect
driven
into
exile
by
the
accidents
of
his
suit
for
divorce
which
have
been
described
he
was
not
in
bodily
danger
after
the
first
excitement
passed
off
if
he
was
ever
in
bodily
danger
at
all
but
he
could
not
reasonably
hope
to
establish
himself
in
a
community
which
had
witnessed
such
disagreeable
facts
concerning
him
before
which
indeed
he
stood
attainted
of
perjury
and
only
saved
from
the
penalty
of
his
crime
by
the
refusal
of
his
wife
to
press
her
case
as
soon
as
her
father
was
strong
enough
to
be
removed
marcia
returned
to
the
east
with
him
in
the
care
of
the
friends
who
continued
with
them
they
did
not
go
back
to
boston
but
went
directly
to
equity
where
in
the
first
flush
of
the
young
and
jubilant
summer
they
opened
the
dim
old
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
street
and
resumed
their
broken
lives
her
father
with
one
side
wavered
out
every
morning
to
his
office
and
sat
there
all
day
the
tremulous
shadow
of
his
former
will
sometimes
his
old
friends
came
in
to
see
him
but
no
one
expected
now
to
hear
the
squire
get
he
no
longer
got
going
on
any
topic
he
had
become
as
a
little
child
as
the
little
child
that
played
about
him
there
in
the
still
warm
summer
days
and
built
houses
with
his
on
the
floor
he
laughed
feebly
at
her
pranks
and
submitted
to
her
rule
with
pathetic
meekness
in
everything
where
marcia
had
not
charged
them
both
to
the
contrary
he
was
very
obedient
to
marcia
who
looked
vigilantly
after
his
welfare
and
knew
all
his
goings
and
comings
as
she
knew
those
of
his
little
comrade
two
or
three
times
a
day
she
ran
out
to
see
that
they
were
safe
but
for
the
rest
she
kept
herself
closely
housed
and
saw
no
one
whom
she
was
not
forced
to
see
only
the
and
the
could
speak
authoritatively
concerning
her
appearance
and
behavior
before
folks
they
reported
the
latter
as
dry
cold
and
uncommunicative
doubtless
the
bitter
experiences
of
her
life
had
wrought
their
due
effect
in
that
passionate
heart
but
probably
it
was
as
much
a
morbid
sensitiveness
as
a
hardened
indifference
that
turned
her
from
her
kind
the
village
inquisitiveness
that
invades
also
suffers
much
eccentricity
and
after
it
had
been
well
ascertained
that
marcia
was
as
queer
as
her
mother
she
was
allowed
to
lead
her
unmolested
life
in
the
old
house
which
had
always
turned
so
cold
a
shoulder
to
the
world
toward
the
end
of
the
summer
the
lame
young
man
and
his
sister
who
had
been
several
times
in
equity
before
paid
her
a
visit
but
stayed
only
a
day
or
two
as
was
accurately
known
by
persons
who
had
noted
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
blinds
in
the
winter
he
came
again
but
this
time
he
came
alone
and
stayed
at
the
hotel
he
remained
over
a
sunday
and
sat
in
the
pulpit
of
the
orthodox
church
where
the
minister
extended
to
him
the
right
hand
of
fellowship
and
invited
him
to
make
the
opening
prayer
it
was
considered
a
good
prayer
generally
speaking
but
it
was
criticised
as
not
containing
anything
attractive
to
young
people
he
was
understood
to
be
on
his
way
to
take
charge
of
a
backwoods
church
down
in
aroostook
county
where
probably
his
prayers
would
be
more
acceptable
to
the
popular
taste
that
winter
squire
gaylord
had
another
stroke
of
paralysis
and
late
in
the
following
spring
he
succumbed
to
a
third
the
old
minister
who
had
once
been
gaylord
pastor
was
now
dead
and
the
squire
was
buried
by
the
lame
man
who
came
up
to
equity
for
that
purpose
at
the
wish
often
expressed
of
the
deceased
this
at
least
was
the
common
report
and
it
is
certain
that
halleck
officiated
in
entering
the
ministry
he
had
returned
to
the
faith
which
had
been
taught
him
almost
before
he
could
speak
he
did
not
defend
or
justify
this
course
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
had
once
thrown
off
all
allegiance
to
creeds
he
said
simply
that
for
him
there
was
no
other
course
he
freely
granted
that
he
had
not
reasoned
back
to
his
old
faith
he
had
fled
to
it
as
to
a
city
of
refuge
his
unbelief
had
been
helped
and
he
no
longer
suffered
himself
to
doubt
he
did
not
ask
if
the
truth
was
here
or
there
any
more
he
only
knew
that
he
could
not
find
it
for
himself
and
he
rested
in
his
inherited
belief
he
accepted
everything
if
he
took
one
jot
or
tittle
away
from
the
book
the
curse
of
doubt
was
on
him
he
had
known
the
terrors
of
the
law
and
he
preached
them
to
his
people
he
had
known
the
divine
mercy
and
he
also
preached
that
the
squire
death
occurred
a
few
months
before
the
news
came
of
another
event
to
which
the
press
of
the
state
referred
with
due
recognition
but
without
great
fulness
of
detail
this
was
the
fatal
case
of
shooting
penalty
or
consequence
as
we
choose
to
consider
it
of
all
that
had
gone
before
which
occurred
at
whited
sepulchre
arizona
where
bartley
hubbard
pitched
his
tent
and
set
up
a
after
leaving
tecumseh
he
began
with
the
issue
of
a
sunday
paper
and
made
it
so
spicy
and
so
indispensable
to
all
the
residents
of
whited
sepulchre
who
enjoyed
the
study
of
their
affairs
that
he
was
looking
hopefully
forward
to
the
establishment
of
a
daily
edition
when
he
unfortunately
chanced
to
comment
upon
the
domestic
relations
of
one
of
whited
sepulchre
leading
the
leading
citizen
promptly
took
the
as
an
esteemed
contemporary
expressed
it
in
reporting
the
difficulty
with
the
cynical
lightness
and
the
profusion
of
felicitous
with
which
our
journalism
often
alleviates
the
history
of
tragic
occurrences
the
parenthetical
touch
in
the
closing
statement
that
mr
hubbard
leaves
a
divorced
wife
and
child
somewhere
at
the
east
was
quite
in
bartley
own
manner
marcia
had
been
widowed
so
long
before
that
this
event
could
make
no
outward
change
in
her
what
inner
change
if
any
it
wrought
is
one
of
those
facts
which
fiction
must
seek
in
vain
to
disclose
but
if
love
such
as
hers
had
been
did
not
deny
his
end
the
pang
of
a
fresh
grief
we
may
be
sure
that
her
sorrow
was
not
unmixed
with
as
unavailing
as
it
was
passionate
and
perhaps
as
unjust
one
evening
a
year
later
the
athertons
sat
talking
over
a
letter
from
halleck
which
atherton
had
brought
from
boston
with
him
it
was
summer
and
they
were
at
their
place
on
the
beverley
shore
it
was
a
long
letter
and
atherton
had
read
parts
of
it
several
times
already
on
his
way
down
in
the
cars
and
had
since
read
it
all
to
his
wife
it
a
very
morbid
letter
he
said
with
a
perplexed
air
when
he
had
finished
yes
she
assented
but
it
a
very
letter
poor
ben
her
husband
took
it
up
again
and
read
here
and
there
a
passage
from
it
but
i
am
turning
to
you
now
for
help
in
a
matter
on
which
my
own
conscience
throws
such
a
fitful
and
uncertain
light
that
i
can
not
trust
it
i
know
that
you
are
a
good
man
atherton
and
i
humbly
beseech
you
to
let
me
have
your
judgment
without
mercy
though
it
slay
me
i
will
abide
by
it
since
her
father
death
she
lives
there
quite
alone
with
her
child
i
have
seen
her
only
once
but
we
write
to
each
other
and
there
are
times
when
it
seems
to
me
at
last
that
i
have
the
right
to
ask
her
to
be
my
wife
the
words
give
me
a
shock
as
i
write
them
and
the
things
which
i
used
to
think
reasons
for
my
right
rise
up
in
witness
against
me
above
all
i
remember
with
horror
that
approved
it
that
he
advised
it
it
is
true
that
i
have
never
by
word
or
deed
suffered
her
to
know
what
was
in
my
heart
but
has
there
ever
been
a
moment
when
i
could
do
so
it
is
true
that
i
have
waited
for
his
death
but
if
i
have
been
willing
he
should
die
am
i
not
a
potential
murderer
oh
what
ridiculous
nonsense
clara
indignantly
protested
atherton
read
on
these
are
the
questions
which
i
ask
myself
in
my
despair
she
is
free
now
but
am
i
free
am
i
not
rather
bound
by
the
past
to
perpetual
silence
there
are
times
when
i
rebel
against
these
tortures
when
i
feel
a
sanction
for
my
love
of
her
an
assurance
from
somewhere
that
it
is
right
and
good
to
love
her
but
then
i
sink
again
for
if
i
ask
whence
this
assurance
comes
i
beseech
you
to
tell
me
what
you
think
has
my
offence
been
so
great
that
nothing
can
atone
for
it
must
i
sacrifice
to
this
fear
all
my
hopes
of
what
i
could
be
to
her
and
for
her
atherton
folded
up
the
letter
and
put
it
back
into
its
envelope
with
a
frown
of
exasperation
i
ca
see
what
should
have
infatuated
halleck
with
that
woman
i
do
believe
now
that
he
loves
her
i
believe
he
only
pities
her
she
is
altogether
inferior
to
him
passionate
jealous
she
would
make
him
miserable
he
much
better
stay
as
he
is
if
it
were
not
pathetic
to
have
him
deifying
her
in
this
way
it
would
be
she
had
a
jealous
temperament
said
clara
looking
down
but
all
the
hallecks
are
fond
of
her
they
think
there
is
a
great
deal
of
good
in
her
do
suppose
ben
himself
thinks
she
is
perfect
but
i
dare
say
interrupted
her
husband
that
he
thinks
he
entirely
sincere
in
asking
my
advice
but
you
can
see
how
he
to
be
of
course
he
wishes
to
marry
her
it
is
so
much
a
question
of
what
a
man
ought
to
have
as
what
he
wants
to
have
in
marrying
is
it
even
the
best
of
men
if
she
is
exacting
and
he
is
good
enough
to
get
on
with
her
if
she
had
a
husband
that
she
could
thoroughly
trust
she
would
be
easy
enough
to
get
on
with
there
is
no
woman
good
enough
to
get
on
with
a
bad
man
it
terrible
to
think
of
that
poor
creature
living
there
by
herself
with
no
one
to
look
after
her
and
her
little
girl
and
if
ben
what
do
you
mean
clara
do
you
see
that
his
being
in
love
with
her
when
she
was
another
man
wife
is
what
he
feels
it
to
be
an
indelible
stain
she
never
knew
it
and
no
one
ever
knew
it
but
you
you
said
it
was
our
deeds
that
judged
us
did
ben
go
away
when
he
realized
his
feeling
for
her
he
came
but
he
did
everything
he
could
to
find
that
poor
wretch
and
he
tried
to
prevent
the
divorce
ben
is
morbid
about
it
but
there
is
no
use
in
our
being
there
was
a
time
when
he
would
have
been
glad
to
profit
by
a
but
he
never
did
you
said
the
will
did
count
and
now
she
is
a
widow
and
any
man
may
ask
her
to
marry
any
man
but
the
one
who
loved
her
during
her
husband
life
that
is
if
he
is
such
a
man
as
halleck
of
course
it
is
a
question
of
gross
black
and
white
mere
right
and
wrong
there
are
degrees
there
are
shades
there
might
be
redemption
for
another
sort
of
man
in
such
a
marriage
but
for
halleck
there
could
only
be
loss
deterioration
lapse
from
the
ideal
i
should
think
that
he
might
suffer
something
of
this
even
in
her
eyes
oh
how
hard
you
are
i
wish
ben
had
asked
your
advice
why
you
are
worse
than
he
is
you
going
to
write
that
to
him
atherton
flung
the
letter
upon
the
table
and
drew
a
troubled
sigh
ah
i
do
know
i
do
know
