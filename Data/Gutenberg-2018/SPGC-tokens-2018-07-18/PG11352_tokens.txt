germany
and
the
next
war
by
general
friedrich
von
bernhardi
translated
by
allen
powles
all
the
patriotic
sections
of
the
german
people
were
greatly
excited
during
the
summer
and
autumn
of
the
conviction
lay
heavy
on
all
hearts
that
in
the
settlement
of
the
morocco
dispute
no
mere
commercial
or
colonial
question
of
minor
importance
was
being
discussed
but
that
the
honour
and
future
of
the
german
nation
were
at
stake
a
deep
rift
had
opened
between
the
feeling
of
the
nation
and
the
diplomatic
action
of
the
government
public
opinion
which
was
clearly
in
favour
of
asserting
ourselves
did
not
understand
the
dangers
of
our
political
position
and
the
sacrifices
which
a
policy
would
have
demanded
i
can
not
say
whether
the
nation
which
undoubtedly
in
an
overwhelming
majority
would
have
gladly
obeyed
the
call
to
arms
would
have
been
equally
ready
to
bear
permanent
and
heavy
burdens
of
taxation
haggling
about
war
contributions
is
as
pronounced
a
characteristic
of
the
german
reichstag
in
modern
berlin
as
it
was
in
medieval
regensburg
these
conditions
have
induced
me
to
publish
now
the
following
pages
which
were
partly
written
some
time
ago
nobody
can
fail
to
see
that
we
have
reached
a
crisis
in
our
national
and
political
development
at
such
times
it
is
necessary
to
be
absolutely
clear
on
three
points
the
goals
to
be
aimed
at
the
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
and
the
sacrifices
to
be
made
the
task
i
have
set
myself
is
to
discuss
these
matters
stripped
of
all
diplomatic
disguise
as
clearly
and
convincingly
as
possible
it
is
obvious
that
this
can
only
be
done
by
taking
a
national
point
of
view
our
science
our
literature
and
the
warlike
achievements
of
our
past
have
made
me
proudly
conscious
of
belonging
to
a
great
civilized
nation
which
in
spite
of
all
the
weakness
and
mistakes
of
bygone
days
must
and
assuredly
will
win
a
glorious
future
and
it
is
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
german
heart
that
i
have
recorded
my
convictions
i
believe
that
thus
i
shall
most
effectually
rouse

national
feeling

introduction
the
value
of
war
for
the
political
and
moral
development
of
mankind
has
been
criticized
by
large
sections
of
the
modern
civilized
world
in
a
way
which
threatens
to
weaken
the
defensive
powers
of
states
by
undermining
the
warlike
spirit
of
the
people
such
ideas
are
widely
disseminated
in
germany
and
whole
strata
of
our
nation
seem
to
have
lost
that
ideal
enthusiasm
which
constituted
the
greatness
of
its
history
with
the
increase
of
wealth
they
live
for
the
moment
they
are
incapable
of
sacrificing
the
enjoyment
of
the
hour
to
the
service
of
great
conceptions
and
close
their
eyes
complacently
to
the
duties
of
our
future
and
to
the
pressing
problems
of
international
life
which
await
a
solution
at
the
present
time
we
have
been
capable
of
soaring
upwards
mighty
deeds
raised
germany
from
political
disruption
and
feebleness
to
the
forefront
of
european
nations
but
we
do
not
seem
willing
to
take
up
this
inheritance
and
to
advance
along
the
path
of
development
in
politics
and
culture
we
tremble
at
our
own
greatness
and
shirk
the
sacrifices
it
demands
from
us
yet
we
do
not
wish
to
renounce
the
claim
which
we
derive
from
our
glorious
past
how
rightly
fichte
once
judged
his
countrymen
when
he
said
the
german
can
never
wish
for
a
thing
by
itself
he
must
always
wish
for
its
contrary
also
the
germans
were
formerly
the
best
fighting
men
and
the
most
warlike
nation
of
europe
for
a
long
time
they
have
proved
themselves
to
be
the
ruling
people
of
the
continent
by
the
power
of
their
arms
and
the
loftiness
of
their
ideas
germans
have
bled
and
conquered
on
countless
battlefields
in
every
part
of
the
world
and
in
late
years
have
shown
that
the
heroism
of
their
ancestors
still
lives
in
the
descendants
in
striking
contrast
to
this
military
aptitude
they
have
become
a
an
almost
too
nation
a
rude
shock
is
needed
to
awaken
their
warlike
instincts
and
compel
them
to
show
their
military
strength
this
love
of
peace
is
due
to
various
causes
it
springs
first
from
the
character
of
the
german
people
which
finds
intense
satisfaction
in
doctrinaire
disputations
and
partisanship
but
dislikes
pushing
things
to
an
extreme
it
is
connected
with
another
characteristic
of
the
german
nature
our
aim
is
to
be
just
and
we
strangely
imagine
that
all
other
nations
with
whom
we
exchange
relations
share
this
aim
we
are
always
ready
to
consider
the
peaceful
assurances
of
foreign
diplomacy
and
of
the
foreign
press
to
be
no
less
genuine
and
true
than
our
own
ideas
of
peace
and
we
obstinately
resist
the
view
that
the
political
world
is
only
ruled
by
interests
and
never
from
ideal
aims
of
philanthropy
justice
goethe
says
aptly
is
a
quality
and
a
phantom
of
the
germans
we
are
always
inclined
to
assume
that
disputes
between
states
can
find
a
peaceful
solution
on
the
basis
of
justice
without
clearly
realizing
what
justice
is
an
additional
cause
of
the
love
of
peace
besides
those
which
are
rooted
in
the
very
soul
of
the
german
people
is
the
wish
not
to
be
disturbed
in
commercial
life
the
germans
are
born
business
men
more
than
any
others
in
the
world
even
before
the
beginning
of
the
thirty
years
war
germany
was
perhaps
the
greatest
trading
power
in
the
world
and
in
the
last
forty
years
germany
trade
has
made
marvellous
progress
under
the
renewed
expansion
of
her
political
power
notwithstanding
our
small
stretch
of
we
have
created
in
a
few
years
the
second
largest
merchant
fleet
in
the
world
and
our
young
industries
challenge
competition
with
all
the
great
industrial
states
of
the
earth
german
are
established
all
over
the
world
german
merchants
traverse
every
quarter
of
the
globe
a
part
indeed
of
english
wholesale
trade
is
in
the
hands
of
germans
who
are
of
course
mostly
lost
to
their
own
country
under
these
conditions
our
national
wealth
has
increased
with
rapid
strides
our
trade
and
our
industries
owners
no
less
than
employés
do
not
want
this
development
to
be
interrupted
they
believe
that
peace
is
the
essential
condition
of
commerce
they
assume
that
free
competition
will
be
conceded
to
us
and
do
not
reflect
that
our
victorious
wars
have
never
disturbed
our
business
life
and
that
the
political
power
regained
by
war
rendered
possible
the
vast
progress
of
our
trade
and
commerce
universal
military
service
too
contributes
to
the
love
of
peace
for
war
in
these
days
does
not
merely
affect
as
formerly
definite
limited
circles
but
the
whole
nation
suffers
alike
all
families
and
all
classes
have
to
pay
the
same
toll
of
human
lives
finally
comes
the
effect
of
that
universal
conception
of
peace
so
characteristic
of
the
times
the
idea
that
war
in
itself
is
a
sign
of
barbarism
unworthy
of
an
aspiring
people
and
that
the
finest
blossoms
of
culture
can
only
unfold
in
peace
under
the
influence
of
such
views
and
aspirations
we
seem
entirely
to
have
forgotten
the
teaching
which
once
the
old
german
empire
received
with
astonishment
and
indignation
from
frederick
the
great
that
the
rights
of
states
can
only
be
asserted
by
the
living
power
that
what
was
won
in
war
can
only
be
kept
by
war
and
that
we
germans
cramped
as
we
are
by
political
and
geographical
conditions
require
the
greatest
efforts
to
hold
and
to
increase
what
we
have
won
we
regard
our
warlike
preparations
as
an
almost
insupportable
burden
which
it
is
the
special
duty
of
the
german
reichstag
to
lighten
so
far
as
possible
we
seem
to
have
forgotten
that
the
conscious
increase
of
our
armament
is
not
an
inevitable
evil
but
the
most
necessary
precondition
of
our
national
health
and
the
only
guarantee
of
our
international
prestige
we
are
accustomed
to
regard
war
as
a
curse
and
refuse
to
recognize
it
as
the
greatest
factor
in
the
furtherance
of
culture
and
power
besides
this
clamorous
need
of
peace
and
in
spite
of
its
continued
justification
other
movements
wishes
and
efforts
inarticulate
and
often
unconscious
live
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
of
the
german
people
the
agelong
dream
of
the
german
nation
was
realized
in
the
political
union
of
the
greater
part
of
the
german
races
and
in
the
founding
of
the
german
empire
since
then
there
lives
in
the
hearts
of
all
i
would
not
exclude
even
the
supporters
of
the
party
a
proud
consciousness
of
strength
of
regained
national
unity
and
of
increased
political
power
this
consciousness
is
supported
by
the
fixed
determination
never
to
abandon
these
acquisitions
the
conviction
is
universal
that
every
attack
upon
these
conquests
will
rouse
the
whole
nation
with
enthusiastic
unanimity
to
arms
we
all
wish
indeed
to
be
able
to
maintain
our
present
position
in
the
world
without
a
conflict
and
we
live
in
the
belief
that
the
power
of
our
state
will
steadily
increase
without
our
needing
to
fight
for
it
we
do
not
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
shrink
from
such
a
conflict
but
we
look
towards
it
with
a
certain
calm
confidence
and
are
inwardly
resolved
never
to
let
ourselves
be
degraded
to
an
inferior
position
without
striking
a
blow
every
appeal
to
force
finds
a
loud
response
in
the
hearts
of
all
not
merely
in
the
north
where
a
proud
efficient
race
with
glorious
traditions
has
grown
up
under
the
banner
of
prussia
does
this
feeling
thrive
as
an
unconscious
basis
of
all
thought
sentiment
and
volition
in
the
depth
of
the
soul
but
in
the
south
also
which
has
suffered
for
centuries
under
the
curse
of
petty
nationalities
the
haughty
pride
and
ambition
of
the
german
stock
live
in
the
heart
of
the
people
here
and
there
maybe
such
emotions
slumber
in
the
shade
of
a
jealous
particularism
overgrown
by
the
richer
and
more
luxuriant
forms
of
social
intercourse
but
still
they
are
animated
by
latent
energy
here
too
the
germs
of
mighty
national
consciousness
await
their
awakening
thus
the
political
power
of
our
nation
while
fully
alive
below
the
surface
is
fettered
externally
by
this
love
of
peace
it
fritters
itself
away
in
fruitless
bickerings
and
doctrinaire
disputes
we
no
longer
have
a
clearly
defined
political
and
national
aim
which
grips
the
imagination
moves
the
heart
of
the
people
and
forces
them
to
unity
of
action
such
a
goal
existed
until
our
wars
of
unification
in
the
yearnings
for
german
unity
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
barbarossa
legend
a
great
danger
to
the
healthy
continuous
growth
of
our
people
seems
to
me
to
lie
in
the
lack
of
it
and
the
more
our
political
position
in
the
world
is
threatened
by
external
complications
the
greater
is
this
danger
extreme
tension
exists
between
the
great
powers
notwithstanding
all
peaceful
prospects
for
the
moment
and
it
is
hardly
to
be
assumed
that
their
aspirations
which
conflict
at
so
many
points
and
are
so
often
pressed
forward
with
brutal
energy
will
always
find
a
pacific
settlement
in
this
struggle
of
the
most
powerful
nations
which
employ
peaceful
methods
at
first
until
the
differences
between
them
grow
irreconcilable
our
german
nation
is
beset
on
all
sides
this
is
primarily
a
result
of
our
geographical
position
in
the
midst
of
hostile
rivals
but
also
because
we
have
forced
ourselves
though
the
the
virtual
upstarts
between
the
states
which
have
earlier
gained
their
place
and
now
claim
our
share
in
the
dominion
of
this
world
after
we
have
for
centuries
been
paramount
only
in
the
realm
of
intellect
we
have
thus
injured
a
thousand
interests
and
roused
bitter
hostilities
it
must
be
reserved
for
a
subsequent
section
to
explain
the
political
situation
thus
affected
but
one
point
can
be
mentioned
without
further
consideration
if
a
violent
solution
of
existing
difficulties
is
adopted
if
the
political
crisis
develops
into
military
action
the
germans
would
have
a
dangerous
situation
in
the
midst
of
all
the
forces
brought
into
play
against
them
on
the
other
hand
the
issue
of
this
struggle
will
be
decisive
of
germany
whole
future
as
state
and
nation
we
have
the
most
to
win
or
lose
by
such
a
struggle
we
shall
be
beset
by
the
greatest
perils
and
we
can
only
emerge
victoriously
from
this
struggle
against
a
world
of
hostile
elements
and
successfully
carry
through
a
seven
years
war
for
our
position
as
a
world
power
if
we
gain
a
start
on
our
probable
enemy
as
if
the
army
which
will
fight
our
battles
is
supported
by
all
the
material
and
spiritual
forces
of
the
nation
if
the
resolve
to
conquer
lives
not
only
in
our
troops
but
in
the
entire
united
people
which
sends
these
troops
to
fight
for
all
their
dearest
possessions
these
were
the
considerations
which
induced
me
to
regard
war
from
the
standpoint
of
civilization
and
to
study
its
relation
to
the
great
tasks
of
the
present
and
the
future
which
providence
has
set
before
the
german
people
as
the
greatest
civilized
people
known
to
history
from
this
standpoint
i
must
first
of
all
examine
the
aspirations
for
peace
which
seem
to
dominate
our
age
and
threaten
to
poison
the
soul
of
the
german
people
according
to
their
true
moral
significance
i
must
try
to
prove
that
war
is
not
merely
a
necessary
element
in
the
life
of
nations
but
an
indispensable
factor
of
culture
in
which
a
true
civilized
nation
finds
the
highest
expression
of
strength
and
vitality
i
must
endeavour
to
develop
from
the
history
of
the
german
past
in
its
connection
with
the
conditions
of
the
present
those
aspects
of
the
question
which
may
guide
us
into
the
unknown
land
of
the
future
the
historical
past
can
not
be
killed
it
exists
and
works
according
to
inward
laws
while
the
present
too
imposes
its
own
drastic
obligations
no
one
need
passively
submit
to
the
pressure
of
circumstances
even
states
stand
like
the
hercules
of
legend
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
they
can
choose
the
road
to
progress
or
to
decadence
a
favoured
position
in
the
world
will
only
become
effective
in
the
life
of
nations
by
the
conscious
human
endeavour
to
use
it
it
seemed
to
me
therefore
to
be
necessary
and
profitable
at
this
parting
of
the
ways
of
our
development
where
we
now
stand
to
throw
what
light
i
may
on
the
different
paths
which
are
open
to
our
people
a
nation
must
fully
realize
the
probable
consequences
of
its
action
then
only
can
it
take
deliberately
the
great
decisions
for
its
future
development
and
looking
forward
to
its
destiny
with
clear
gaze
be
prepared
for
any
sacrifices
which
the
present
or
future
may
demand
these
sacrifices
so
far
as
they
lie
within
the
military
and
financial
sphere
depend
mainly
on
the
idea
of
what
germany
is
called
upon
to
strive
for
and
attain
in
the
present
and
the
future
only
those
who
share
my
conception
of
the
duties
and
obligations
of
the
german
people
and
my
conviction
that
they
can
not
be
fulfilled
without
drawing
the
sword
will
be
able
to
estimate
correctly
my
arguments
and
conclusions
in
the
purely
military
sphere
and
to
judge
competently
the
financial
demands
which
spring
out
of
it
it
is
only
in
their
logical
connection
with
the
entire
development
political
and
moral
of
the
state
that
the
military
requirements
find
their
motive
and
their
justification
chapter
i
the
right
to
make
war
since
when
immanuel
kant
published
in
his
old
age
his
treatise
on
perpetual
peace
many
have
considered
it
an
established
fact
that
war
is
the
destruction
of
all
good
and
the
origin
of
all
evil
in
spite
of
all
that
history
teaches
no
conviction
is
felt
that
the
struggle
between
nations
is
inevitable
and
the
growth
of
civilization
is
credited
with
a
power
to
which
war
must
yield
but
undisturbed
by
such
human
theories
and
the
change
of
times
war
has
again
and
again
marched
from
country
to
country
with
the
clash
of
arms
and
has
proved
its
destructive
as
well
as
creative
and
purifying
power
it
has
not
succeeded
in
teaching
mankind
what
its
real
nature
is
long
periods
of
war
far
from
convincing
men
of
the
necessity
of
war
have
on
the
contrary
always
revived
the
wish
to
exclude
war
where
possible
from
the
political
intercourse
of
nations
this
wish
and
this
hope
are
widely
disseminated
even
the
maintenance
of
peace
is
lauded
as
the
only
goal
at
which
statesmanship
should
aim
this
unqualified
desire
for
peace
has
obtained
in
our
days
a
quite
peculiar
power
over
men
spirits
this
aspiration
finds
its
public
expression
in
peace
leagues
and
peace
congresses
the
press
of
every
country
and
of
every
party
opens
its
columns
to
it
the
current
in
this
direction
is
indeed
so
strong
that
the
majority
of
governments
profess
outwardly
at
any
rate
that
the
necessity
of
maintaining
peace
is
the
real
aim
of
their
policy
while
when
a
war
breaks
out
the
aggressor
is
universally
stigmatized
and
all
governments
exert
themselves
partly
in
reality
partly
in
pretence
to
extinguish
the
conflagration
pacific
ideals
to
be
sure
are
seldom
the
real
motive
of
their
action
they
usually
employ
the
need
of
peace
as
a
cloak
under
which
to
promote
their
own
political
aims
this
was
the
real
position
of
affairs
at
the
hague
congresses
and
this
is
also
the
meaning
of
the
action
of
the
united
states
of
america
who
in
recent
times
have
earnestly
tried
to
conclude
treaties
for
the
establishment
of
arbitration
courts
first
and
foremost
with
england
but
also
with
japan
france
and
germany
no
practical
results
it
must
be
said
have
so
far
been
achieved
we
can
hardly
assume
that
a
real
love
of
peace
prompts
these
efforts
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
precisely
those
powers
which
as
the
weaker
are
exposed
to
aggression
and
therefore
were
in
the
greatest
need
of
international
protection
have
been
completely
passed
over
in
the
american
proposals
for
arbitration
courts
it
must
consequently
be
assumed
that
very
political
motives
led
the
americans
with
their
commercial
instincts
to
take
such
steps
and
induced
perfidious
albion
to
accede
to
the
proposals
we
may
suppose
that
england
intended
to
protect
her
rear
in
event
of
a
war
with
germany
but
that
america
wished
to
have
a
free
hand
in
order
to
follow
her
policy
of
sovereignty
in
central
america
without
hindrance
and
to
carry
out
her
plans
regarding
the
panama
canal
in
the
exclusive
interests
of
america
both
countries
certainly
entertained
the
hope
of
gaining
advantage
over
the
other
signatory
of
the
treaty
and
of
winning
the
lion
share
for
themselves
theorists
and
fanatics
imagine
that
they
see
in
the
efforts
of
president
taft
a
great
step
forward
on
the
path
to
perpetual
peace
and
enthusiastically
agree
with
him
even
the
minister
for
foreign
affairs
in
england
with
idealism
termed
the
procedure
of
the
united
states
an
era
in
the
history
of
mankind
this
desire
for
peace
has
rendered
most
civilized
nations
anemic
and
marks
a
decay
of
spirit
and
political
courage
such
as
has
often
been
shown
by
a
race
of
epigoni
it
has
always
been
von
treitschke
tells
us
the
weary
spiritless
and
exhausted
ages
which
have
played
with
the
dream
of
perpetual
peace
everyone
will
within
certain
limits
admit
that
the
endeavours
to
diminish
the
dangers
of
war
and
to
mitigate
the
sufferings
which
war
entails
are
justifiable
it
is
an
incontestable
fact
that
war
temporarily
disturbs
industrial
life
interrupts
quiet
economic
development
brings
widespread
misery
with
it
and
emphasizes
the
primitive
brutality
of
man
it
is
therefore
a
most
desirable
consummation
if
wars
for
trivial
reasons
should
be
rendered
impossible
and
if
efforts
are
made
to
restrict
the
evils
which
follow
necessarily
in
the
train
of
war
so
far
as
is
compatible
with
the
essential
nature
of
war
all
that
the
hague
peace
congress
has
accomplished
in
this
limited
sphere
deserves
like
every
permissible
humanization
of
war
universal
acknowledgment
but
it
is
quite
another
matter
if
the
object
is
to
abolish
war
entirely
and
to
deny
its
necessary
place
in
historical
development
this
aspiration
is
directly
antagonistic
to
the
great
universal
laws
which
rule
all
life
war
is
a
biological
necessity
of
the
first
importance
a
regulative
element
in
the
life
of
mankind
which
can
not
be
dispensed
with
since
without
it
an
unhealthy
development
will
follow
which
excludes
every
advancement
of
the
race
and
therefore
all
real
civilization
war
is
the
father
of

things

all

the
need

which
brings
down
even

the
universal
struggle
for

and

there
can
be
no

of
healthy
budding
elements
and
a
universal
decadence
would
follow
war
says
von
schlegel
is
as
necessary
as
the
struggle
of
the
elements
in
nature
now
it
is
of
course
an
obvious
fact
that
a
peaceful
rivalry
may
exist
between
peoples
and
states
like
that
between
the
of
a
society
in
all
departments
of
civilized
life
a
struggle
which
need
not
always
degenerate
into
war
struggle
and
war
are
not
identical
this
rivalry
however
does
not
take
place
under
the
same
conditions
as
the
intrasocial
struggle
and
therefore
can
not
lead
to
the
same
results
above
the
rivalry
of
individuals
and
groups
within
the
state
stands
the
law
which
takes
care
that
injustice
is
kept
within
bounds
and
that
the
right
shall
prevail
behind
the
law
stands
the
state
armed
with
power
which
it
employs
and
rightly
so
not
merely
to
protect
but
actively
to
promote
the
moral
and
spiritual
interests
of
society
but
there
is
no
impartial
power
that
stands
above
the
rivalry
of
states
to
restrain
injustice
and
to
use
that
rivalry
with
conscious
purpose
to
promote
the
highest
ends
of
mankind
between
states
the
only
check
on
injustice
is
force
and
in
morality
and
civilization
each
people
must
play
its
own
part
and
promote
its
own
ends
and
ideals
if
in
doing
so
it
comes
into
conflict
with
the
ideals
and
views
of
other
states
it
must
either
submit
and
concede
the
precedence
to
the
rival
people
or
state
or
appeal
to
force
and
face
the
risk
of
the
real
struggle
of
war
in
order
to
make
its
own
views
prevail
no
power
exists
which
can
judge
between
states
and
makes
its
judgments
prevail
nothing
in
fact
is
left
but
war
to
secure
to
the
true
elements
of
progress
the
ascendancy
over
the
spirits
of
corruption
and
decay
it
will
of
course
happen
that
several
weak
nations
unite
and
form
a
superior
combination
in
order
to
defeat
a
nation
which
in
itself
is
stronger
this
attempt
will
succeed
for
a
time
but
in
the
end
the
more
intensive
vitality
will
prevail
the
allied
opponents
have
the
seeds
of
corruption
in
them
while
the
powerful
nation
gains
from
a
temporary
reverse
a
new
strength
which
procures
for
it
an
ultimate
victory
over
numerical
superiority
the
history
of
germany
is
an
eloquent
example
of
this
truth
struggle
is
therefore
a
universal
law
of
nature
and
the
instinct
of
which
leads
to
struggle
is
acknowledged
to
be
a
natural
condition
of
existence
man
is
a
fighter
is
a
renunciation
of
life
whether
in
the
existence
of
the
individual
or
in
the
life
of
states
which
are
agglomerations
of
individuals
the
first
and
paramount
law
is
the
assertion
of
one
own
independent
existence
by
alone
can
the
state
maintain
the
conditions
of
life
for
its
citizens
and
insure
them
the
legal
protection
which
each
man
is
entitled
to
claim
from
it
this
duty
of
is
by
no
means
satisfied
by
the
mere
repulse
of
hostile
attacks
it
includes
the
obligation
to
assure
the
possibility
of
life
and
development
to
the
whole
body
of
the
nation
embraced
by
the
state
strong
healthy
and
flourishing
nations
increase
in
numbers
from
a
given
moment
they
require
a
continual
expansion
of
their
frontiers
they
require
new
territory
for
the
accommodation
of
their
surplus
population
since
almost
every
part
of
the
globe
is
inhabited
new
territory
must
as
a
rule
be
obtained
at
the
cost
of
its
possessors
that
is
to
say
by
conquest
which
thus
becomes
a
law
of
necessity
the
right
of
conquest
is
universally
acknowledged
at
first
the
procedure
is
pacific
countries
pour
a
stream
of
emigrants
into
other
states
and
territories
these
submit
to
the
legislature
of
the
new
country
but
try
to
obtain
favourable
conditions
of
existence
for
themselves
at
the
cost
of
the
original
inhabitants
with
whom
they
compete
this
amounts
to
conquest
the
right
of
colonization
is
also
recognized
vast
territories
inhabited
by
uncivilized
masses
are
occupied
by
more
highly
civilized
states
and
made
subject
to
their
rule
higher
civilization
and
the
correspondingly
greater
power
are
the
foundations
of
the
right
to
annexation
this
right
is
it
is
true
a
very
indefinite
one
and
it
is
impossible
to
determine
what
degree
of
civilization
justifies
annexation
and
subjugation
the
impossibility
of
finding
a
legitimate
limit
to
these
international
relations
has
been
the
cause
of
many
wars
the
subjugated
nation
does
not
recognize
this
right
of
subjugation
and
the
more
powerful
civilized
nation
refuses
to
admit
the
claim
of
the
subjugated
to
independence
this
situation
becomes
peculiarly
critical
when
the
conditions
of
civilization
have
changed
in
the
course
of
time
the
subject
nation
has
perhaps
adopted
higher
methods
and
conceptions
of
life
and
the
difference
in
civilization
has
consequently
lessened
such
a
state
of
things
is
growing
ripe
in
british
india
lastly
in
all
times
the
right
of
conquest
by
war
has
been
admitted
it
may
be
that
a
growing
people
can
not
win
colonies
from
uncivilized
races
and
yet
the
state
wishes
to
retain
the
surplus
population
which
the
can
no
longer
feed
then
the
only
course
left
is
to
acquire
the
necessary
territory
by
war
thus
the
instinct
of
leads
inevitably
to
war
and
the
conquest
of
foreign
soil
it
is
not
the
possessor
but
the
victor
who
then
has
the
right
the
threatened
people
will
see
the
point
of
goethe
lines
that
which
them
didst
inherit
from
thy
sires
in
order
to
possess
it
must
be
won
the
procedure
of
italy
in
tripoli
furnishes
an
example
of
such
conditions
while
germany
in
the
morocco
question
could
not
rouse
herself
to
a
similar
resolution
c
footnote

this
does
not
imply
that
germany
could
and
ought
to
have
occupied
part
of
morocco
on
more
than
one
ground
i
think
that
it
was
imperative
to
maintain
the
actual
sovereignty
of
this
state
on
the
basis
of
the
algeçiras
convention
among
other
advantages
which
need
not
be
discussed
here
germany
would
have
had
the
country
secured
to
her
as
a
possible
sphere
of
colonization
that
would
have
set
up
justifiable
claims
for
the
future
in
such
cases
might
gives
the
right
to
occupy
or
to
conquer
might
is
at
once
the
supreme
right
and
the
dispute
as
to
what
is
right
is
decided
by
the
arbitrament
of
war
war
gives
a
biologically
just
decision
since
its
decisions
rest
on
the
very
nature
of
things
just
as
increase
of
population
forms
under
certain
circumstances
a
convincing
argument
for
war
so
industrial
conditions
may
compel
the
same
result
in
america
england
germany
to
mention
only
the
chief
commercial
countries
industries
offer
remunerative
work
to
great
masses
of
the
population
the
native
population
can
not
consume
all
the
products
of
this
work
the
industries
depend
therefore
mainly
on
exportation
work
and
employment
are
secured
so
long
as
they
find
markets
which
gladly
accept
their
products
since
they
are
paid
for
by
the
foreign
country
but
this
foreign
country
is
intensely
interested
in
liberating
itself
from
such
tribute
and
in
producing
itself
all
that
it
requires
we
find
therefore
a
general
endeavour
to
call
home
industries
into
existence
and
to
protect
them
by
tariff
barriers
and
on
the
other
hand
the
foreign
country
tries
to
keep
the
markets
open
to
itself
to
crush
or
cripple
competing
industries
and
thus
to
retain
the
consumer
for
itself
or
win
fresh
ones
it
is
an
embittered
struggle
which
rages
in
the
market
of
the
world
it
has
already
often
assumed
definite
hostile
forms
in
tariff
wars
and
the
future
will
certainly
intensify
this
struggle
great
commercial
countries
will
on
the
one
hand
shut
their
doors
more
closely
to
outsiders
and
countries
hitherto
on
the
will
develop
home
industries
which
under
more
favourable
conditions
of
labour
and
production
will
be
able
to
supply
goods
cheaper
than
those
imported
from
the
old
industrial
states
these
latter
will
see
their
position
in
these
world
markets
endangered
and
thus
it
may
well
happen
that
an
export
country
can
no
longer
offer
satisfactory
conditions
of
life
to
its
workers
such
a
state
runs
the
danger
not
only
of
losing
a
valuable
part
of
its
population
by
emigration
but
of
also
gradually
falling
from
its
supremacy
in
the
civilized
and
political
world
through
diminishing
production
and
lessened
profits
in
this
respect
we
stand
at
the
threshold
of
a
development
we
can
not
reject
the
possibility
that
a
state
under
the
necessity
of
providing
remunerative
work
for
its
population
may
be
driven
into
war
if
more
valuable
advantages
than
even
now
is
the
case
had
been
at
stake
in
morocco
and
had
our
export
trade
been
seriously
menaced
germany
would
hardly
have
conceded
to
france
the
most
favourable
position
in
the
morocco
market
without
a
struggle
england
doubtless
would
not
shrink
from
a
war
to
the
knife
just
as
she
fought
for
the
ownership
of
the
south
african
goldfields
and
if
any
attack
threatened
her
indian
market
the
control
of
which
is
the
foundation
of
her
world
sovereignty
the
knowledge
therefore
that
war
depends
on
biological
laws
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
every
attempt
to
exclude
it
from
international
relations
must
be
demonstrably
untenable
but
it
is
not
only
a
biological
law
but
a
moral
obligation
and
as
such
an
indispensable
factor
in
civilization
the
attitude
which
is
adopted
towards
this
idea
is
closely
connected
with
the
view
of
life
generally
if
we
regard
the
life
of
the
individual
or
of
the
nation
as
something
purely
material
as
an
incident
which
terminates
in
death
and
outward
decay
we
must
logically
consider
that
the
highest
goal
which
man
can
attain
is
the
enjoyment
of
the
most
happy
life
and
the
greatest
possible
diminution
of
all
bodily
suffering
the
state
will
be
regarded
as
a
sort
of
assurance
office
which
guarantees
a
life
of
undisturbed
possession
and
enjoyment
in
the
widest
meaning
of
the
word
we
must
endorse
the
view
which
wilhelm
von
humboldt
professed
in
his
treatise
on
the
limits
of
the
activity
of
the
state
d
the
compulsory
functions
of
the
state
must
be
limited
to
the
assurance
of
property
and
life
the
state
will
be
considered
as
a
and
the
individual
will
be
inclined
to
shun
war
as
the
greatest
conceivable
evil

if
on

we
consider
the
life
of
men
and
of

as
merely
a
fraction
of
a
collective
existence
whose
final
purpose
does
not
rest

on

if
we

merely
as

accessory
of

chequered

the
task
of

the

the
highest
expansion

of
securing
for
them
that
influence
on
the

which
tends
to
the

progress
of

we

in

to
the
human
race
whose

it

the

it

that

that
is
alike
for

the

moral
task
this

to

the
idea
of
the

into
that
of

and
thus
to
entrust
apparently
higher
duties
to
the

leads
to
error
since
in
a
human
race
conceived
as
a
whole

by

the
most

principle
would

such

political

calls
for

while
materialism
in
theory
at
least
repudiates
it
if
we
grasp
the
conception
of
the
state
from
this
higher
aspect
we
shall
soon
see
that
it
can
not
attain
its
great
moral
ends

its
political
power
increases
the
higher
object
at
which
it
aims
is
closely
correlated
to
the
advancement
of

it
is
only
the

which
strives
after

develops
into

can
only
find
scope
on
the
great
stage
of
action
which
power
creates
but
when
the
state
renounces
all
extension
of
power
and
recoils
from
every
war
which
is
necessary
for
its
expansion
when
it
is
content

i
recognize
in
the
effect
of
war
upon
national
character
said
wilhelm
von
humboldt
one
of
the
most
salutary
elements
in
the
moulding
of
the
human
race
the
individual
can
perform
no
nobler
moral
action
than
to
pledge
his
life
on
his
convictions
and
to
devote
his
own
existence
to
the
cause
which
he
serves
or
even
to
the
conception
of
the
value
of
ideals
to
personal
morality
similarly
nations
and
states
can
achieve
no
loftier
consummation
than
to
stake
their
whole
power
on
upholding
their
independence
their
honour
and
their
reputation
such
sentiments
however
can
only
be
put
into
practice
in
war
the
possibility
of
war
is
required
to
give
the
national
character
that
stimulus
from
which
these
sentiments
spring
and
thus
only
are
nations
enabled
to
do
justice
to
the
highest
duties
of
civilization
by
the
fullest
development
of
their
moral
forces
an
intellectual
and
vigorous
nation
can
experience
no
worse
destiny
than
to
be
lulled
into
a
phaecian
existence
by
the
undisputed
enjoyment
of
peace
from
this
point
of
view
efforts
to
secure
peace
are
extraordinarily
detrimental
to
the
national
health
so
soon
as
they
influence
politics
the
states
which
from
various
considerations
are
always
active
in
this
direction
are
sapping
the
roots
of
their
own
strength
the
united
states
of
america
in
june
championed
the
ideas
of
universal
peace
in
order
to
be
able
to
devote
their
undisturbed
attention
to
and
the
enjoyment
of
wealth
and
to
save
the
three
hundred
million
dollars
which
they
spend
on
their
army
and
navy
they
thus
incur
a
great
danger
not
so
much
from
the
possibility
of
a
war
with
england
or
japan
but
precisely
because
they
try
to
exclude
all
chance
of
contest
with
opponents
of
their
own
strength
and
thus
avoid
the
stress
of
great
political
emotions
without
which
the
moral
development
of
the
national
character
is
impossible
if
they
advance
farther
on
this
road
they
will
one
day
pay
dearly
for
such
a
policy
again
from
the
christian
standpoint
we
arrive
at
the
same
conclusion
christian
morality
is
based
indeed
on
the
law
of
love
love
god
above
all
things
and
thy
neighbour
as
thyself
this
law
can
claim
no
significance
for
the
relations
of
one
country
to
another
since
its
application
to
politics
would
lead
to
a
conflict
of
duties
the
love
which
a
man
showed
to
another
country
as
such
would
imply
a
want
of
love
for
his
own
countrymen
such
a
system
of
politics
must
inevitably
lead
men
astray
christian
morality
is
personal
and
social
and
in
its
nature
can
not
be
political
its
object
is
to
promote
morality
of
the
individual
in
order
to
strengthen
him
to
work
unselfishly
in
the
interests
of
the
community
it
tells
us
to
love
our
individual
enemies
but
does
not
remove
the
conception
of
enmity
christ
himself
said
i
am
not
come
to
send
peace
on
earth
but
a
sword
his
teaching
can
never
be
adduced
as
an
argument
against
the
universal
law
of
struggle
there
never
was
a
religion
which
was
more
combative
than
christianity
combat
moral
combat
is
its
very
essence
if
we
transfer
the
ideas
of
christianity
to
the
sphere
of
politics
we
can
claim
to
raise
the
power
of
the
state
power
in
the
widest
sense
not
merely
from
the
material
aspect
to
the
highest
degree
with
the
object
of
the
moral
advancement
of
humanity
and
under
certain
conditions
the
sacrifice
may
be
made
which
a
war
demands
thus
according
to
christianity
we
can
not
disapprove
of
war
in
itself
but
must
admit
that
it
is
justified
morally
and
historically
again
we
should
not
be
entitled
to
assume
that
from
the
opposite
the
purely
materialistic
standpoint
war
is
entirely
precluded
the
individual
who
holds
such
views
will
certainly
regard
it
with
disfavour
since
it
may
cost
him
life
and
prosperity
the
state
however
as
such
can
also
come
from
the
materialistic
standpoint
to
a
decision
to
wage
war
if
it
believes
that
by
a
certain
sacrifice
of
human
lives
and
happiness
the
conditions
of
life
of
the
community
may
be
improved
the
loss
is
restricted
to
comparatively
few
and
since
the
fundamental
notion
of
all
materialistic
philosophy
inevitably
leads
to
selfishness
the
majority
of
the
citizens
have
no
reason
for
not
sacrificing
the
minority
in
their
own
interests
thus
those
who
from
the
materialistic
standpoint
deny
the
necessity
of
war
will
admit
its
expediency
from
motives
of
reflection
thus
shows
not
only
that
war
is
an
unqualified
necessity
but
that
it
is
justifiable
from
every
point
of
view
the
practical
methods
which
the
adherents
of
the
peace
idea
have
proposed
for
the
prevention
of
war
are
shown
to
be
absolutely
ineffective
it
is
sometimes
assumed
that
every
war
represents
an
infringement
of
rights
and
that
not
only
the
highest
expression
of
civilization
but
also
the
true
welfare
of
every
nation
is
involved
in
the
fullest
assertion
of
these
rights
and
proposals
are
made
from
time
to
time
on
this
basis
to
settle
the
disputes
which
arise
between
the
various
countries
by
arbitration
courts
and
so
to
render
war
impossible
the
politician
who
without
in
these
proposals
honestly
believes
in
their
practicability
must
be
amazingly
two
questions
in
this
connection
are
at
once
suggested
on
what
right
is
the
finding
of
this
arbitration
court
based
and
what
sanctions
insure
that
the
parties
will
accept
this
finding
to
the
first
question
the
answer
is
that
such
a
right
does
not
and
can
not
exist
the
conception
of
right
is
twofold
it
signifies
firstly
the
consciousness
of
right
the
living
feeling
of
what
is
right
and
good
secondly
the
right
laid
down
by
society
and
the
state
either
written
or
sanctioned
by
tradition
in
its
first
meaning
it
is
an
indefinite
purely
personal
conception
in
its
second
meaning
it
is
variable
and
capable
of
development
the
right
determined
by
law
is
only
an
attempt
to
secure
a
right
in
itself
in
this
sense
right
is
the
system
of
social
aims
secured
by
compulsion
it
is
therefore
impossible
that
a
written
law
should
meet
all
the
special
points
of
a
particular
case
the
application
of
the
legal
right
must
always
be
qualified
in
order
to
correspond
more
or
less
to
the
idea
of
justice
a
certain
freedom
in
deciding
on
the
particular
case
must
be
conceded
to
the
administration
of
justice
the
established
law
within
a
given
and
restricted
circle
of
ideas
is
only
occasionally
absolutely
just
the
conception
of
this
right
is
still
more
obscured
by
the
complex
nature
of
the
consciousness
of
right
and
wrong
a
quite
different
consciousness
of
right
and
wrong
develops
in
individuals
whether
persons
or
peoples
and
this
consciousness
finds
its
expression
in
most
varied
forms
and
lives
in
the
heart
of
the
people
by
the
side
of
and
frequently
in
opposition
to
the
established
law
in
christian
countries
murder
is
a
grave
crime
amongst
a
people
where
is
a
sacred
duty
it
can
be
regarded
as
a
moral
act
and
its
neglect
as
a
crime
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
such
different
conceptions
of
right
there
is
yet
another
cause
of
uncertainty
the
moral
consciousness
of
the
same
people
alters
with
the
changing
ideas
of
different
epochs
and
schools
of
philosophy
the
established
law
can
seldom
keep
pace
with
this
inner
development
this
growth
of
moral
consciousness
it
lags
behind
a
condition
of
things
arises
where
the
living
moral
consciousness
of
the
people
conflicts
with
the
established
law
where
legal
forms
are
superannuated
but
still
exist
and
scoffing
words
are
true
laws
are
transmitted
as
one
sees
just
like
inherited
disease
they
handed
down
from
race
to
race
and
noiseless
glide
from
place
to
place
reason
they
turn
to
nonsense
worse
they
make
beneficence
a
curse
ah
me
that
you
a
grandson
you
as
long
as
you
alive
shall
rue
translation
by
sir
martin
thus
no
absolute
rights
can
be
laid
down
even
for
men
who
share
the
same
ideas
in
their
private
and
social
intercourse
the
conception
of
the
constitutional
state
in
the
strictest
sense
is
an
impossibility
and
would
lead
to
an
intolerable
state
of
things
the
hard
and
fast
principle
must
be
modified
by
the
progressive
development
of
the
fixed
law
as
well
as
by
the
application
of
mercy
and
of
allowed
by
the
community
if
sometimes
between
individuals
the
duel
alone
meets
the
sense
of
justice
how
much
more
impossible
must
a
universal
international
law
be
in
the
and
complicated
relations
between
nations
and
states
each
nation
evolves
its
own
conception
of
right
each
has
its
particular
ideals
and
aims
which
spring
with
a
certain
inevitableness
from
its
character
and
historical
life
these
various
views
bear
in
themselves
their
living
justification
and
may
well
be
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
other
nations
and
none
can
say
that
one
nation
has
a
better
right
than
the
other
there
never
have
been
and
never
will
be
universal
rights
of
men
here
and
there
particular
relations
can
be
brought
under
definite
international
laws
but
the
bulk
of
national
life
is
absolutely
outside
codification
even
were
some
such
attempt
made
even
if
a
comprehensive
international
code
were
drawn
up
no
nation
would
sacrifice
its
own
conception
of
right
to
it
by
so
doing
it
would
renounce
its
highest
ideals
it
would
allow
its
own
sense
of
justice
to
be
violated
by
an
injustice
and
thus
dishonour
itself
arbitration
treaties
must
be
peculiarly
detrimental
to
an
aspiring
people
which
has
not
yet
reached
its
political
and
national
zenith
and
is
bent
on
expanding
its
power
in
order
to
play
its
part
honourably
in
the
civilized
world
every
arbitration
court
must
originate
in
a
certain
political
status
it
must
regard
this
as
legally
constituted
and
must
treat
any
alterations
however
necessary
to
which
the
whole
of
the
contracting
parties
do
not
agree
as
an
encroachment
in
this
way
every
progressive
change
is
arrested
and
a
legal
position
created
which
may
easily
conflict
with
the
actual
turn
of
affairs
and
may
check
the
expansion
of
the
young
and
vigorous
state
in
favour
of
one
which
is
sinking
in
the
scale
of
civilization
these
considerations
supply
the
answer
to
the
second
decisive
question
how
can
the
judgment
of
the
arbitration
court
be
enforced
if
any
state
refuses
to
submit
to
it
where
does
the
power
reside
which
insures
the
execution
of
this
judgment
when
pronounced
in
america
elihu
root
formerly
secretary
of
state
declared
in
that
the
high
court
of
international
justice
established
by
the
second
hague
conference
would
be
able
to
pronounce
definite
and
binding
decisions
by
virtue
of
the
pressure
brought
to
bear
by
public
opinion
the
present
leaders
of
the
american
peace
movement
seem
to
share
this
idea
with
a
childlike
they
appear
to
believe
that
public
opinion
must
represent
the
view
which
the
american
plutocrats
think
most
profitable
to
themselves
they
have
no
notion
that
the
widening
development
of
mankind
has
quite
other
concerns
than
material
prosperity
commerce
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
public
opinion
would
be
far
from
unanimous
and
real
compulsion
could
only
be
employed
by
means
of
war
the
very
thing
which
is
to
be
avoided
we
can
imagine
a
court
of
arbitration
intervening
in
the
quarrels
of
the
separate
tributary
countries
when
an
empire
like
the
roman
empire
existed
such
an
empire
never
can
or
will
arise
again
even
if
it
did
it
would
assuredly
like
a
universal
peace
league
be
disastrous
to
all
human
progress
which
is
dependent
on
the
clashing
interests
and
the
unchecked
rivalry
of
different
groups
so
long
as
we
live
under
such
a
state
system
as
at
present
the
german
imperial
chancellor
certainly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
he
declared
in
his
speech
in
the
reichstag
on
march
that
treaties
for
arbitration
between
nations
must
be
limited
to
clearly
ascertainable
legal
issues
and
that
a
general
arbitration
treaty
between
two
countries
afforded
no
guarantee
of
permanent
peace
such
a
treaty
merely
proved
that
between
the
two
contracting
states
no
serious
inducement
to
break
the
peace
could
be
imagined
it
therefore
only
confirmed
the
relations
already
existing
if
these
relations
change
if
differences
develop
between
the
two
nations
which
affect
their
national
existence
which
to
use
a
homely
phrase
cut
them
to
the
quick
then
every
arbitration
treaty
will
burn
like
tinder
and
end
in
smoke
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
a
peaceful
decision
by
an
arbitration
court
can
never
replace
in
its
effects
and
consequences
a
warlike
decision
even
as
regards
the
state
in
whose
favour
it
is
pronounced
if
we
imagine
for
example
that
silesia
had
fallen
to
frederick
the
great
by
the
finding
of
a
court
of
arbitration
and
not
by
a
war
of
unparalleled
heroism
would
the
winning
of
this
province
have
been
equally
important
for
prussia
and
for
germany
no
one
will
maintain
this
the
material
increase
in
power
which
accrued
to
frederick
country
by
the
acquisition
of
silesia
is
not
to
be
underestimated
but
far
more
important
was
the
circumstance
that
this
country
could
not
be
conquered
by
the
strongest
european
coalition
and
that
it
vindicated
its
position
as
the
home
of
unfettered
intellectual
and
religious
development
it
was
war
which
laid
the
foundations
of
prussia
power
which
amassed
a
heritage
of
glory
and
honour
that
can
never
be
again
disputed
war
forged
that
prussia
hard
as
steel
on
which
the
new
germany
could
grow
up
as
a
mighty
european
state
and
a
world
power
of
the
future
here
once
more
war
showed
its
creative
power
and
if
we
learn
the
lessons
of
history
we
shall
see
the
same
result
again
and
again
if
we
sum
up
our
arguments
we
shall
see
that
from
the
most
opposite
aspects
the
efforts
directed
towards
the
abolition
of
war
must
not
only
be
termed
foolish
but
absolutely
immoral
and
must
be
stigmatized
as
unworthy
of
the
human
race
to
what
does
the
whole
question
amount
it
is
proposed
to
deprive
men
of
the
right
and
the
possibility
to
sacrifice
their
highest
material
possessions
their
physical
life
for
ideals
and
thus
to
realize
the
highest
moral
unselfishness
it
is
proposed
to
obviate
the
great
quarrels
between
nations
and
states
by
courts
of
arbitration
that
is
by
arrangements
a
restricted
formal
law
is
to
be
established
in
the
place
of
the
decisions
of
history
the
weak
nation
is
to
have
the
same
right
to
live
as
the
powerful
and
vigorous
nation
the
whole
idea
represents
a
presumptuous
encroachment
on
the
natural
laws
of
development
which
can
only
lead
to
the
most
disastrous
consequences
for
humanity
generally
with
the
cessation
of
the
unrestricted
competition
whose
ultimate
appeal
is
to
arms
all
real
progress
would
soon
be
checked
and
a
moral
and
intellectual
stagnation
would
ensue
which
must
end
in
degeneration
so
too
when
men
lose
the
capacity
of
gladly
sacrificing
the
highest
material
blessings
life
health
property
and
comfort
for
ideals
for
the
maintenance
of
national
character
and
political
independence
for
the
expansion
of
sovereignty
and
territory
in
the
interests
of
the
national
welfare
for
a
definite
influence
in
the
concert
of
nations
according
to
the
scale
of
their
importance
in
civilization
for
intellectual
freedom
from
dogmatic
and
political
compulsion

with

on

that
valour
is
a

where
with

and

prosperity
war
ceases
military
efficiency
diminishes

under

the

approaching
their
downfall
and

not
hold
their

or
racially

people
can
only
hope
to
take
up
a
firm
position
in
the
political
world
when
national
character
and
military
tradition
act
and
react
upon
each
these
are
the
words
of
clausewitz
the
great
philosopher
of
war
and
he
is
incontestably
right
these
efforts
for
peace
would
if
they
attained
their
goal
not
merely
lead
to
general
degeneration
as
happens
everywhere
in
nature
where
the
struggle
for
existence
is
eliminated
but
they
have
a
direct
damaging
and
unnerving
effect
the
apostles
of
peace
draw
large
sections
of
a
nation
into
the
spell
of
their
utopian
efforts
and
they
thus
introduce
an
element
of
weakness
into
the
national
life
they
cripple
the
justifiable
national
pride
in
independence
and
support
a
nerveless
opportunist
policy
by
surrounding
it
with
the
glamour
of
a
higher
humanity
and
by
offering
it
specious
reasons
for
disguising
its
own
weakness
they
thus
play
the
game
of
their
less
scrupulous
enemies
just
as
the
prussian
policy
steeped
in
the
ideas
of
universal
peace
did
in
and
and
brought
the
state
to
the
brink
of
destruction
the
functions
of
true
humanity
are
twofold
on
the
one
hand
there
is
the
promotion
of
the
intellectual
moral
and
military
forces
as
well
as
of
political
power
as
the
surest
guarantee
for
the
uniform
development
of
character
on
the
other
hand
there
is
the
practical
realization
of
ideals
according
to
the
law
of
love
in
the
life
of
the
individual
and
of
the
community
it
seems
to
me
reasonable
to
compare
the
efforts
directed
towards
the
suppression
of
war
with
those
of
the
social
democratic
labour
party
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
them
the
aims
of
both
parties
are
utopian
the
organized
labour
party
strives
after
an
ideal
whose
realization
is
only
conceivable
when
the
rate
of
wages
and
the
hours
of
work
are
settled
internationally
for
the
whole
industrial
world
and
when
the
cost
of
living
is
everywhere
uniformly
regulated
until
this
is
the
case
the
prices
of
the
international
market
determine
the
standard
of
wages
the
nation
which
leaves
this
out
of
account
and
tries
to
settle
independently
wages
and
working
hours
runs
the
risk
of
losing
its
position
in
the
international
market
in
competition
with
nations
who
work
longer
hours
and
at
lower
rates
want
of
employment
and
extreme
misery
among
the
working
classes
would
inevitably
be
the
result
on
the
other
hand
the
internationalization
of
industries
would
soon
by
excluding
and
preventing
any
competition
produce
a
deterioration
of
products
and
a
profound
demoralization
of
the
working
population
the
case
of
the
scheme
for
universal
peace
is
similar
its
execution
as
we
saw
would
be
only
feasible
in
a
world
empire
and
this
is
as
impossible
as
the
uniform
regulation
of
the
world
industries
a
state
which
disregarded
the
differently
conceived
notions
of
neighbouring
countries
and
wished
to
make
the
idea
of
universal
peace
the
guiding
rule
for
its
policy
would
only
inflict
a
fatal
injury
on
itself
and
become
the
prey
of
more
resolute
and
warlike
neighbours
we
can
fortunately
assert
the
impossibility
of
these
efforts
after
peace
ever
attaining
their
ultimate
object
in
a
world
bristling
with

is
determined
by

tried

the
calm

strength
with
which
she
faced
once
more
her
duties
as
a
nation
when
king
william
and
bismarck
were
at
the
helm
was
soon
abundantly
manifest
bismarck
by
bringing
about
our
wars
of
unification
in
order
to
improve
radically
an
untenable
position
and
secure
to
our
people
healthy
conditions
of
life
fulfilled
the
wish
of
the
german
people
and
raised
germany
to
the
undisputed
rank
of
a
european
power
the
military
successes
and
the
political
position
won
by
the
sword
laid
the
foundation
for
an
unparalleled
material
prosperity
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
pitiable
the
progress
of
the
german
people
would
have
been
had
not
these
wars
been
brought
about
by
a
deliberate
policy
the
most
recent
history
tells
the
same
story
if
we
judge
the
japanese
standpoint
with
an
unbiased
mind
we
shall
find
the
resolution
to
fight
russia
was
not
only
heroic
but
politically
wise
and
morally
justifiable
it
was
immensely
daring
to
challenge
the
russian
giant
but
the
purely
military
conditions
were
favourable
and
the
japanese
nation
which
had
rapidly
risen
to
a
high
stage
of
civilization
needed
an
extended
sphere
of
influence
to
complete
her
development
and
to
open
new
channels
for
her
superabundant
activities
japan
from
her
own
point
of
view
was
entitled
to
claim
to
be
the
predominant
civilized
power
in
eastern
asia
and
to
repudiate
the
rivalry
of
russia
the
japanese
statesmen
were
justified
by
the
result
the
victorious
campaign
created
wider
conditions
of
life
for
the
japanese
people
and
state
and
at
one
blow
raised
it
to
be
a
determining
in
international
politics
and
gave
it
a
political
importance
which
must
undeniably
lead
to
great
material
advancement
if
this
war
had
been
avoided
from
weakness
or
philanthropic
illusions
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
matters
would
have
taken
a
very
different
turn
the
growing
power
of
russia
in
the
amur
district
and
in
korea
would
have
repelled
or
at
least
hindered
the
japanese
rival
from
rising
to
such
a
height
of
power
as
was
attained
through
this
war
glorious
alike
for
military
prowess
and
political
foresight
the
appropriate
and
conscious
employment
of
war
as
a
political
means
has
always
led
to
happy
results
even
an
unsuccessfully
waged
war
may
sometimes
be
more
beneficial
to
a
people
than
the
surrender
of
vital
interests
without
a
blow
we
find
an
example
of
this
in
the
recent
heroic
struggle
of
the
small
boer
states
against
the
british
empire
in
this
struggle
they
were
inevitably
defeated
it
was
easy
to
foresee
that
an
armed
peasantry
could
not
permanently
resist
the
combined
forces
of
england
and
her
colonies
and
that
the
peasant
armies
generally
could
not
bear
heavy
losses
but
yet
if
all
indications
are
not
misleading
the
blood
shed
by
the
boer
people
will
yield
a
free
and
prosperous
future
in
spite
of
much
weakness
the
resistance
was
heroic
men
like
president
stein
botha
and
de
wett
with
their
gallant
followers
performed
many
great
military
feats
the
whole
nation
combined
and
rose
unanimously
to
fight
for
the
freedom
of
which
byron
sings
for
freedom
battle
once
begun
bequeathed
from
bleeding
sire
to
son
though
baffled
oft
is
ever
won
inestimable
moral
gains
which
can
never
be
lost
in
any
later
developments
have
been
won
by
this
struggle
the
boers
have
maintained
their
place
as
a
nation
in
a
certain
sense
they
have
shown
themselves
superior
to
the
english
it
was
only
after
many
glorious
victories
that
they
yielded
to
a
crushingly
superior
force
they
accumulated
a
store
of
fame
and
national
consciousness
which
makes
them
though
conquered
a
power
to
be
reckoned
with
the
result
of
this
development
is
that
the
boers
are
now
the
foremost
people
in
south
africa
and
that
england
preferred
to
grant
them
than
to
be
faced
by
their
continual
hostility

laid
the
foundation

the
united

the
truth
came
like
a
flash
that
all
along
we
had
been
conquering
the
country
not
the
race
winning
positions
not
battles
to
aim
at
so
cowing
the
boer
national
spirit
as
to
gain
a
permanent
political
ascendancy
for
ourselves
was
an
object
beyond
our
power
to
achieve
peaceable
political
fusion
under

the

we
could

that

introduction

in

itself
be

in

ages
as

great
statesman
of
south
africa
who
despite
the
unfavourable
material
conditions
knew
how
to
value
the
inestimable
moral
qualities
according
to
their
real
importance
the
lessons
of
history
thus
confirm
the
view
that
wars
which
have
been
deliberately
provoked
by
statesmen
have
had
the
happiest
results
war
nevertheless
must
always
be
a
violent
form
of
political
agent
which
not
only
contains
in
itself
the
danger
of
defeat
but
in
every
case
calls
for
great
sacrifices
and
entails
incalculable
misery
he
who
determines
upon
war
accepts
a
great
responsibility
it
is
therefore
obvious
that
no
one
can
come
to
such
a
decision
except
from
the
most
weighty
reasons
more
especially
under
the
existing
conditions
which
have
created
national
armies
absolute
clearness
of
vision
is
needed
to
decide
how
and
when
such
a
resolution
can
be
taken
and
what
political
aims
justify
the
use
of
armed
force
this
question
therefore
needs
careful
consideration
and
a
satisfactory
answer
can
only
be
derived
from
an
examination
of
the
essential
duty
of
the
state
if
this
duty
consists
in
giving
scope
to
the
highest
intellectual
and
moral
development
of
the
citizens
and
in
in
the
moral
education
of
the
human
race
then
the
state
own
acts
must
necessarily
conform
to
the
moral
laws
but
the
acts
of
the
state
can
not
be
judged
by
the
standard
of
individual
morality
if
the
state
wished
to
conform
to
this
standard
it
would
often
find
itself
at
variance
with
its
own
particular
duties
the
morality
of
the
state
must
be
developed
out
of
its
own
peculiar
essence
just
as
individual
morality
is
rooted
in
the
personality
of
the
man
and
his
duties
towards
society
the
morality
of
the
state
must
be
judged
by
the
nature
and
of
the
state
and
not
of
the
individual
citizen
but
the
and
of
a
state
is
power
and
he
who
is
not

enough

look

the
criterion
of
the

rests
in

developed
his
own

to
the
highest

degree

h
if
the

standard
is
applied
to

then
its
highest
moral
duty
is
to
increase
its
power
the
individual
must
sacrifice
himself
for
the
higher
community
of
which
he
is
a
member

the
state
is
itself
the
highest
conception
in

therefore
the
duty
of
does
not
enter
into

the
christian
duty
of
sacrifice
for
something
higher
does
not
exist
for
the
state

there
is
nothing
higher
than
it
in
the
world
history
consequently
it
can
not
sacrifice
itself
to
something
higher
when
a
state
sees
its
downfall
staring
it
in

we
applaud
if
it
succumbs

sacrifice
made
to

i
have
thought
it
impossible
to
explain
the
foundations
of
political
morality
better
than
in
the
words
of
our
great
national
historian
but
we
can
reach
the
same
conclusions
by
another
road
the
individual
is
responsible
only
for
himself
if
either
from
weakness
or
from
moral
reasons
he
neglects
his
own
advantage
he
only
injures
himself
the
consequences
of
his
actions
recoil
only
on
him
the
situation
is
quite
different
in
the
case
of
a
state
it
represents
the
ramifying
and
often
conflicting
interests
of
a
community
should
it
from
any
reason
neglect
the
interests
it
not
only
to
some
extent
prejudices
itself
as
a
legal
personality
but
it
injures
also
the
body
of
private
interests
which
it
represents
this
incalculably
detriment
affects
not
merely
one
individual
responsible
merely
to
himself
but
a
mass
of
individuals
and
the
community
accordingly
it
is
a
moral
duty
of
the
state
to
remain
loyal
to
its
own
peculiar
function
as
guardian
and
promoter
of
all
higher
interests
this
duty
it
can
not
fulfil
unless
it
possesses
the
needful
power
the
increase
of
this
power
is
thus
from
this
standpoint
also
the
first
and
foremost
duty
of
the
state
this
aspect
of
the
question
supplies
a
fair
standard
by
which
the
morality
of
the
actions
of
the
state
can
be
estimated
the
crucial
question
is
how
far
has
the
state
performed
this
duty
and
thus
served
the
interests
of
the
community
and
this
not
merely
in
the
material
sense
but
in
the
higher
meaning
that
material
interests
are
justifiable
only
so
far
as
they
promote
the
power
of
the
state
and
thus
indirectly
its
higher
aims
it
is
obvious
in
view
of
the
complexity
of
social
conditions
that
numerous
private
interests
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
interest
of
the
community
and
from
the
limitations
of
human
discernment
it
is
only
natural
that
the
view
taken
of
interests
of
the
community
may
be
erroneous
nevertheless
the
advancement
of
the
power
of
the
state
must
be
first
and
foremost
the
object
that
guides
the
statesman
policy
among
all
political
sins
the
sin
of
feebleness
is
the
most
contemptible
it
is
the
political
sin
against
the
holy
ghost
j
this
argument
of
political
morality
is
open
to
the
objection
that
it
leads
logically
to
the
jesuitic
principle
that
the
end
justifies
the

a
most
difficult
problem
is
raised
by
the
question
how
far
for
political
objects
moral
in
themselves
means
may
be
employed
which
must
be
regarded
as
reprehensible
in
the
life
of
the
individual
so
far
as
i
know
no
satisfactory
solution
has
yet
been
obtained
and
i
do
not
feel
bound
to
attempt
one
at
this
point
war
with
which
i
am
dealing
at
present
is
no
reprehensible
means
in
itself
but
it
may
become
so
if
it
pursues
unmoral
or
frivolous
aims
which
bear
no
comparison
with
the
seriousness
of
warlike
measures
i
must
deviate
here
a
little
from
my
main
theme
and
discuss
shortly
some
points
which
touch
the
question
of
political
morality
the
gulf
between
political
and
individual
morality
is
not
so
wide
as
is
generally
assumed
the
power
of
the
state
does
not
rest
exclusively
on
the
factors
that
make
up
material
power
territory
population
wealth
and
a
large
army
and
navy
it
rests
to
a
high
degree
on
moral
elements
which
are
reciprocally
related
to
the
material
the
energy
with
which
a
state
promotes
its
own
interests
and
represents
the
rights
of
its
citizens
in
foreign
states
the
determination
which
it
displays
to
support
them
on
occasion
by
force
of
arms
constitute
a
real
factor
of
strength
as
compared
with
all
such
countries
as
can
not
bring
themselves
to
let
things
come
to
a
crisis
in
a
like
case
similarly
a
reliable
and
honourable
policy
forms
an
element
of
strength
in
dealings
with
allies
as
well
as
with
foes
a
statesman
is
thus
under
no
obligation
to
deceive
deliberately
he
can
from
the
political
standpoint
avoid
all
negotiations
which
compromise
his
personal
integrity
and
he
will
thereby
serve
the
reputation
and
power
of
his
state
no
less
than
when
he
holds
aloof
from
political
menaces
to
which
no
acts
correspond
and
renounces
all
political
formulas
and
phrases
in
antiquity
the
murder
of
a
tyrant
was
thought
a
moral
action
and
the
jesuits
have
tried
to
justify
regicide
k
at
the
present
day
political
murder
is
universally
condemned
from
the
standpoint
of
political
morality
the
same
holds
good
of
preconcerted
political
deception
a
state
which
employed
deceitful
methods
would
soon
sink
into
disrepute
the
man
who
pursues
moral
ends
with
unmoral
means
is
involved
in
a
contradiction
of
motives
and
nullifies
the
object
at
which
he
aims
since
he
denies
it
by
his
actions
it
is
not
of
course
necessary
that
a
man
communicate
all
his
intentions
and
ultimate
objects
to
an
opponent
the
latter
can
be
left
to
form
his
own
opinion
on
this
point
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
lie
deliberately
or
to
practise
crafty
deceptions
a
fine
frankness
has
everywhere
been
the
characteristic
of
great
statesmen
subterfuges
and
duplicity
mark
the
petty
spirit
of
diplomacy

finally
the
relations
between
two
states
must
often
be
termed
a
latent
war
which
is
provisionally
being
waged
in
peaceful
rivalry
such
a
position
justifies
the
employment
of
hostile
methods
cunning
and
deception
just
as
war
itself
does
since
in
such
a
case
both
parties
are
determined
to
employ
them
i
believe
after
all
that
a
conflict
between
personal
and
political
morality
may
be
avoided
by
wise
and
prudent
diplomacy
if
there
is
no
concealment
of
the
desired
end
and
it
is
recognized
that
the
means
employed
must
correspond
to
the
ultimately
moral
nature
of
that
end
recognized
rights
are
of
course
often
violated
by
political
action
but
these
as
we
have
already
shown
are
never
absolute
rights
they
are
of
human
origin
and
therefore
imperfect
and
variable
there
are
conditions
under
which
they
do
not
correspond
to
the
actual
truth
of
things
in
this
case
the
jus
summa
holds
good
and
the
infringement
of
the
right
appears
morally
justified
york
decision
to
conclude
the
convention
of
tauroggen
was
indisputably
a
violation
of
right
but
it
was
a
moral
act
for
the
alliance
was
made
under
compulsion
and
was
antagonistic
to
all
the
vital
interests
of
the
prussian
state
it
was
essentially
untrue
and
immoral
now
it
is
always
justifiable
to
terminate
an
immoral
situation
as
regards
the
employment
of
war
as
a
political
means
our
argument
shows
that
it
becomes
the
duty
of
a
state
to
make
use
of
the
not
only
when
it
is
attacked
but
when
by
the
policy
of
other
states
the
power
of
the
particular
state
is
threatened
and
peaceful
methods
are
insufficient
to
secure
its
integrity
this
power
as
we
saw
rests
on
a
material
basis
but
finds
expression
in
ethical
values
war
therefore
seems
imperative
when
although
the
material
basis
of
power
is
not
threatened
the
moral
influence
of
the
state
and
this
is
the
ultimate
point
at
issue
seems
to
be
prejudiced
thus
apparently
trifling
causes
may
under
certain
circumstances
constitute
a
fully
justifiable
if
the
honour
of
the
state
and
consequently
its
moral
prestige
are
endangered
this
prestige
is
an
essential
part
of
its
power
an
antagonist
must
never
be
allowed
to
believe
that
there
is
any
lack
of
determination
to
assert
this
prestige
even
if
the
sword
must
be
drawn
to
do
so
in
deciding
for
war
or
peace
the
next
important
consideration
is
whether
the
question
under
discussion
is
sufficiently
vital
for
the
power
of
the
state
to
justify
the
determination
to
fight
whether
the
inevitable
dangers
and
miseries
of
a
war
do
not
threaten
to
inflict
greater
injury
on
the
interests
of
the
state
than
the
disadvantages
which
according
to
human
calculation
must
result
if
war
is
not
declared
a
further
point
to
be
considered
is
whether
the
general
position
of
affairs
affords
some
reasonable
prospect
of
military
success
with
these
considerations
of
expediency
certain
other
weighty
aspects
of
the
question
must
also
be
faced
it
must
always
be
kept
in
mind
that
a
state
is
not
justified
in
looking
only
to
the
present
and
merely
consulting
the
immediate
advantage
of
the
existing
generation
such
policy
would
be
opposed
to
all
that
constitutes
the
essential
nature
of
the
state
its
conduct
must
be
guided
by
the
moral
duties
incumbent
on
it
which
as
one
step
is
gained
point
to
the
next
higher
and
prepare
the
present
for
the
future
the
true
greatness
of
the
state
is
that
it
links
the
past
with
the
present
and
the
future
consequently
the
individual
has
no
right
to
regard
the
state
as
a
means
for
attaining
his
own
ambitions
in
life

p
the
law
of
development
thus
becomes
a
leading
factor
in
politics
and
in
the
decision
for
war
this
consideration
must
weigh
more
heavily
than
the
sacrifices
necessarily
to
be
borne
in
the
present
i
can
not
conceive
zelter
once
wrote
to
goethe
how
any
right
deed
can
be
performed
without
sacrifice
all
worthless
actions
must
lead
to
the
very
opposite
of
what
is
desirable
a
second
point
of
view
which
must
not
be
neglected
is
precisely
that
which
zelter
rightly
emphasizes
a
great
end
can
not
be
attained
except
by
staking
large
intellectual
and
material
resources
and
no
certainty
of
success
can
ever
be
anticipated
every
undertaking
implies
a
greater
or
less
venture
the
daily
intercourse
of
civic
life
teaches
us
this
lesson
and
it
can
not
be
otherwise
in
politics
where
account
must
be
taken
of
most
powerful
antagonists
whose
strength
can
only
be
vaguely
estimated
in
questions
of
comparatively
trifling
importance
much
may
be
done
by
agreements
and
compromises
and
mutual
concessions
may
produce
a
satisfactory
status
the
solution
of
such
problems
is
the
sphere
of
diplomatic
activity
the
state
of
things
is
quite
different
when
vital
questions
are
at
issue
or
when
the
opponent
demands
concession
but
will
guarantee
none
and
is
clearly
bent
on
humiliating
the
other
party
then
is
the
time
for
diplomatists
to
be
silent
and
for
great
statesmen
to
act
men
must
be
resolved
to
stake
everything
and
can
not
shun
the
solemn
decision
of
war
in
such
questions
any
reluctance
to
face
the
opponent
every
abandonment
of
important
interests
and
every
attempt
at
a
temporizing
settlement
means
not
only
a
momentary
loss
of
political
prestige
and
frequently
of
real
power
which
may
possibly
be
made
good
in
another
place
but
a
permanent
injury
to
the
interests
of
the
state
the
full
gravity
of
which
is
only
felt
by
future
generations
not
that
a
rupture
of
pacific
relations
must
always
result
in
such
a
case
the
mere
threat
of
war
and
the
clearly
proclaimed
intention
to
wage
it
if
necessary
will
often
cause
the
opponent
to
give
way
this
intention
must
however
be
made
perfectly
plain
for
negotiations
without
arms
are
like
without
instruments
as
frederick
the
great
said
it
is
ultimately
the
actual
strength
of
a
nation
to
which
the
opponent
purpose
yields
when
therefore
the
threat
of
war
is
insufficient
to
call
attention
to
its
own
claims
the
concert
must
begin
the
obligation
is
unconditional
and
the
to
fight
becomes
the
to
make
war
incumbent
on
the
nation
and
statesman
alike
finally
there
is
a
third
point
to
be
considered
cases
may
occur
where
war
must
be
made
simply
as
a
point
of
honour
although
there
is
no
prospect
of
success
the
responsibility
of
this
has
also
to
be
borne
so
at
least
frederick
the
great
thought
his
brother
henry
after
the
battle
of
kolin
had
advised
him
to
throw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
marquise
de
pompadour
in
order
to
purchase
a
peace
with
france
again
after
the
battle
of
kunersdorf
his
position
seemed
quite
hopeless
but
the
king
absolutely
refused
to
abandon
the
struggle
he
knew
better
what
suited
the
honour
and
the
moral
value
of
his
country
and
preferred
to
die
sword
in
hand
than
to
conclude
a
degrading
peace
president
roosevelt
in
his
message
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
america
on
december
gave
expression
to
a
similar
thought
it
must
ever
be
kept
in
mind
so
the
manly
and
inspiriting
words
ran
that
war
is
not
merely
justifiable
but
imperative
upon
honourable
men
and
upon
an
honourable
nation
when
peace
is
only
to
be
obtained
by
the
sacrifice
of
conscientious
conviction
or
of
national
welfare
a
just
war
is
in
the
far
better
for
a
nation
soul
than
the
most
prosperous
peace
obtained
by
an
acquiescence
in
wrong
or
injustice
it
must
be
remembered
that
even
to
be
defeated
in
war
may
be
better
than
not
to
have
fought
at
all
to
sum
up
these
various
views
we
may
say
that
expediency
in
the
higher
sense
must
be
conclusive
in
deciding
whether
to
undertake
a
war
in
itself
morally
justifiable
such
decision
is
rendered
more
easy
by
the
consideration
that
the
prospects
of
success
are
always
the
greatest
when
the
moment
for
declaring
war
can
be
settled
to
suit
the
political
and
military
situation
it
must
further
be
remembered
that
every
success
in
foreign
policy
especially
if
obtained
by
a
demonstration
of
military
strength
not
only
heightens
the
power
of
the
state
in
foreign
affairs
but
adds
to
the
reputation
of
the
government
at
home
and
thus
enables
it
better
to
fulfil
its
moral
aims
and
civilizing
duties
no
one
will
thus
dispute
the
assumption
that
under
certain
circumstances
it
is
the
moral
and
political
duty
of
the
state
to
employ
war
as
a
political
means
so
long
as
all
human
progress
and
all
natural
development
are
based
on
the
law
of
conflict
it
is
necessary
to
engage
in
such
conflict
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
possible
when
a
state
is
confronted
by
the
material
impossibility
of
supporting
any
longer
the
warlike
preparations
which
the
power
of
its
enemies
has
forced
upon
it
when
it
is
clear
that
the
rival
states
must
gradually
acquire
from
natural
reasons
a
lead
that
can
not
be
won
back
when
there
are
indications
of
an
offensive
alliance
of
stronger
enemies
who
only
await
the
favourable
moment
to
strike
the
moral
duty
of
the
state
towards
its
citizens
is
to
begin
the
struggle
while
the
prospects
of
success
and
the
political
circumstances
are
still
tolerably
favourable
when
on
the
other
hand
the
hostile
states
are
weakened
or
hampered
by
affairs
at
home
and
abroad
but
its
own
warlike
strength
shows
elements
of
superiority
it
is
imperative
to
use
the
favourable
circumstances
to
promote
its
own
political
aims
the
danger
of
a
war
may
be
faced
the
more
readily
if
there
is
good
prospect
that
great
results
may
be
obtained
with
comparatively
small
sacrifices
these
obligations
can
only
be
met
by
a
vigorous
resolute
active
policy
which
follows
definite
ideas
and
understands
how
to
arouse
and
concentrate
all
the
living
forces
of
the
state
conscious
of
the
truth
of
schiller
lines
the
chance
that
once
thou
hast
refused
will
never
through
the
centuries
recur
the
verdict
of
history
will
condemn
the
statesman
who
was
unable
to
take
the
responsibility
of
a
bold
decision
and
sacrificed
the
hopes
of
the
future
to
the
present
need
of
peace
it
is
obvious
that
under
these
circumstances
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
answer
the
question
whether
in
any
special
case
conditions
exist
which
justify
the
determination
to
make
war
the
difficulty
is
all
the
greater
because
the
historical
significance
of
the
act
must
be
considered
and
the
immediate
result
is
not
the
final
criterion
of
its
justification
war
is
not
always
the
final
judgment
of
heaven
there
are
successes
which
are
transitory
while
the
national
life
is
reckoned
by
centuries

ultimate
verdict

consider
how

must
not

we
must
look
at
the
business
of

the

with
the
eyes
of

asking
why
these
murders

historical
development
the
life
of
the
individual
citizen
is
valuable
only
when
it
is
consciously
and
actively
employed
for
the
attainment
of
great
ends
the
same
holds
good
of
nations
and
states
they
are
as
it
were
personalities
in
the
framework
of
collective
humanity
infinitely
various
in
their
endowments
and
their
characteristic
qualities
capable
of
the
most
different
achievements
and
serving
the
most
multifarious
purposes
in
the
great
evolution
of
human
existence
such
a
theory
will
not
be
accepted
from
the
standpoint
of
the
materialistic
philosophy
which
prevails
among
wide
circles
of
our
nation
according
to
it
all
that
happens
in
the
world
is
a
necessary
consequence
of
given
conditions
free
will
is
only
necessity
become
conscious
it
denies
the
difference
between
the
empiric
and
the
intelligible
ego
which
is
the
basis
of
the
notion
of
moral
freedom
this
philosophy
can
not
stand
before
scientific
criticism
it
seems
everywhere
arbitrarily
restricted
by
the
narrow
limits
of
the
insufficient
human
intelligence
the
existence
of
the
universe
is
opposed
to
the
law
of
a
sufficient
cause
infinity
and
eternity
are
incomprehensible
to
our
conceptions
which
are
confined
to
space
and
time
the
essential
nature
of
force
and
volition
remains
inexplicable
we
recognize
only
a
subjectively
qualified
phenomenon
in
the
world
the
impelling
forces
and
the
real
nature
of
things
are
withdrawn
from
our
understanding
a
systematic
explanation
of
the
universe
is
quite
impossible
from
the
human
standpoint
so
much
seems
clear
although
no
demonstrable
certainty
attaches
to
this
theory
that
spiritual
laws
beyond
the
comprehension
of
us
men
govern
the
world
according
to
a
conscious
plan
of
development
in
the
revolving
cycles
of
a
perpetual
change
even
the
gradual
evolution
of
mankind
seems
ruled
by
a
hidden
moral
law
at
any
rate
we
recognize
in
the
growing
spread
of
civilization
and
common
moral
ideas
a
gradual
progress
towards
purer
and
higher
forms
of
life
it
is
indeed
impossible
for
us
to
prove
design
and
purpose
in
every
individual
case
because
our
attitude
to
the
universal
whole
is
too
limited
and
anomalous
but
within
the
limitations
of
our
knowledge
of
things
and
of
the
inner
necessity
of
events
we
can
at
least
try
to
understand
in
broad
outlines
the
ways
of
providence
which
we
may
also
term
the
principles
of
development
we
shall
thus
obtain
useful
guidance
for
our
further
investigation
and
procedure
the
agency
and
will
of
providence
are
most
clearly
seen
in
the
history
of
the
growth
of
species
and
races
of
peoples
and
states
what
is
true
goethe

but
be

is
false
only
lowered
and
dissipated
by
its
history
the
formation
of
peoples
and
races
the
rise
and
fall
of
states
the
laws
which
govern
the
common
life
teach
us
to
recognize
which
forces
have
a
creative
sustaining
and
beneficent
influence
and
which
work
towards
disintegration
and
thus
produce
inevitable
downfall
we
are
here
following
the
working
of
universal
laws
but
we
must
not
forget
that
states
are
personalities
endowed
with
very
different
human
attributes
with
a
peculiar
and
often
very
marked
character
and
that
these
subjective
qualities
are
distinct
factors
in
the
development
of
states
as
a
whole
impulses
and
influences
exercise
a
very
different
effect
on
the
separate
national
individualities
we
must
endeavour
to
grasp
history
in
the
spirit
of
the
psychologist
rather
than
of
the
naturalist
each
nation
must
be
judged
from
its
own
standpoint
if
we
wish
to
learn
the
general
trend
of
its
development
we
must
study
the
history
of
the
german
people
in
its
connection
with
that
of
the
other
european
states
and
ask
first
what
paths
its
development
has
hitherto
followed
and
what
guidance
the
past
gives
for
our
future
policy
from
the
time
of
their
first
appearance
in
history
the
germans
showed
themselves
a
civilized
people
when
the
roman
empire
broke
up
before
the
onslaught
of
the
barbarians
there
were
two
main
elements
which
shaped
the
future
of
the
west
christianity
and
the
germans
the
christian
teaching
preached
equal
rights
for
all
men
and
community
of
goods
in
an
empire
of
masters
and
slaves
but
formulated
the
highest
moral
code
and
directed
the
attention
of
a
race
which
only
aimed
at
luxury
to
the
world
beyond
the
grave
as
the
true
goal
of
existence
it
made
the
value
of
man
as
man
and
the
moral
development
of
personality
according
to
the
laws
of
the
individual
conscience
the
of
all
development
it
thus
gradually
transformed
the
philosophy
of
the
ancient
world
whose
morality
rested
solely
on
the
relations
with
the
state
simultaneously
with
this
hordes
of
germans
from
the
north
poured
victoriously
in
broad
streams
over
the
roman
empire
and
the
decaying
nations
of
the
ancient
world
these
masses
could
not
keep
their
nationality
pure
and
maintain
their
position
as
political
powers
the
states
which
they
founded
were
even
then
men
recognized
how
difficult
it
is
for
a
lower
civilization
to
hold
its
own
against
a
higher
the
germans
were
gradually
merged
in
the
subject
nations
the
german
element
however
instilled
new
life
into
these
nations
and
offered
new
opportunities
for
growth
the
stronger
the
admixture
of
german
blood
the
more
vigorous
and
the
more
capable
of
civilization
did
the
growing
nations
appear
in
the
meantime
powerful
opponents
sprung
up
in
this
world
the
latin
race
grew
up
by
degrees
out
of
the
admixture
of
the

those

the

deteriorated

could
not

from

nature

precursor
of
the
reformation
which
conceived
in
the
innermost
heart
of
the
german
people
shook
europe
to
her
foundations
once
more
it
was
the
german
people
which
as
formerly
in
the
struggle
between
the
arian
goths
and
the
orthodox
church
shed
it
heart
blood
in
a
religious
war
for
spiritual
liberty
and
now
for
national
independence
also
no
struggle
more
pregnant
with
consequences
for
the
development
of
humanity
had
been
fought
out
since
the
persian
wars
in
this
cause
the
german
people
nearly
disappeared
and
lost
all
political
importance
large
sections
of
the
empire
were
abandoned
to
foreign
states
germany
became
a
desert
but
this
time
the
church
did
not
remain
victorious
as
she
did
against
the
arian
goths
and
the
staufers
it
is
true
she
was
not
laid
prostrate
she
still
remained
a
mighty
force
and
drew
new
strength
from
the
struggle
itself
politically
the
catholic
states
under
spanish
leadership
won
an
undisputed
supremacy
but
on
the
other
hand
the
right
to
spiritual
freedom
was
established
this
most
important
element
of
civilization
was
retained
for
humanity
in
the
reformed
churches
and
has
become
ever
since
the
palladium
of
all
progress
though
even
after
the
peace
of
westphalia
protracted
struggles
were
required
to
assert
religious
freedom
the
states
of
the
latin
race
on
their
side
now
put
forward
strong
claims
to
the
universal
imperium
in

to
suppress

ideas
of

spain
first
then
france
the

soon
quarrelled
among
themselves
about

time

england
a
protestant
power
was
being
developed
and
the
age
of
discoveries
which
coincided
roughly
with
the
end
of
the
reformation
and
the
thirty
years
war
opened
new
and
unsuspected
paths
to
human
intellect
and
human
energy
political
life
also
acquired
a
fresh
stimulus
gradually
a
broad
stream
of
immigrants
poured
into
the
districts
of
america
the
northern
part
of
which
fell
to
the
lot
of
the
germanic
and
the
southern
part
to
that
of
the
latin
race
thus
was
laid
the
foundation
of
the
great
colonial
empires
and
consequently
of
world
politics
germany
remained
excluded
from
this
great
movement
since
she
wasted
her
forces
in
ecclesiastical
disputes
and
religious
wars
on
the
other
hand
in
combination
with
england
the
low
countries
and
austria
which
latter
had
at
the
same
time
to

of

east
she
successfully
curbed
the
french
ambition
for
sovereignty
in
a
long
succession
of
wars
england
by
these
wars
grew
to
be
the
first
colonial
and
maritime
power
in
the
world
germany
forfeited
large
tracts
of
territory
and
lost
still
more
in
political
power
she
broke
up
into
numerous
feeble
separate
states
which
were
entirely
void
of
any
common
sympathy
with
the
german
cause
but
this
very
disintegration
lent
her
fresh
strength
a
centre
of
protestant
power
was
established
in
the
north
prussia
after
centuries
of
struggle
the
germans
had
succeeded
in
driving
back
the
slavs
who
poured
in
from
the
east
in
wrestling
large
tracts
from
them
and
in
completely
germanizing
them
this
struggle
like
that
with
the
niggard
soil
produced
a
sturdy
race
conscious
of
its
strength
which
extended
its
power
to
the
coasts
of
the
baltic
and
successfully
planted
germanic
culture
in
the
far
north
the
german
nation
was
finally
victorious
also
against
swedes
who
disputed
the
command
of
the
baltic
in
that
war
the
great
elector
had
laid
the
foundations
of
a
strong
political
power
which
under
his
successors
gradually
grew
into
an
influential
force
in
germany
the
headship
of
protestant
germany
devolved
more
and
more
on
this
state
and
a
counterpoise
to
catholic
austria
grew
up
this
latter
state
had
developed
out
of
germany
into
an
independent
great
power
resting
its
supremacy
not
only
on
a
german
population
but
also
on
hungarians
and
slavs
in
the
seven
years
war
prussia
broke
away
from
catholic
austria
and
the
empire
and
confronted
france
and
russia
as
an
independent
protestant
state
but
yet
another
dark
hour
was
in
store
for
germany
as
she
once
more
slowly
struggled
upwards
in
france
the
monarchy
has
exhausted
the
resources
of
the
nation
for
its
own
selfish
ends
the
motto
of
the
monarchy
moi
carried
to
an
extreme
provoked
a
tremendous
revulsion
of
ideas
which
culminated
in
the
stupendous
revolution
of
and
everywhere
in
europe
and
more
specially
in
germany
shattered
and
swept
away
the
obsolete
remnants
of
medievalism
the
german
empire
as
such
disappeared
only
fragmentary
states
survived
among
which
prussia
alone
showed
any
real
power
france
once
again
under
napoleon
was
fired
with
the
conception
of
the
universal
imperium
and
bore
her
victorious
eagles
to
italy
egypt
syria
germany
and
spain
and
even
to
the
inhospitable
plains
of
russia
which
by
a
gradual
political
absorption
of
the
slavonic
east
and
a
slow
expansion
of
power
in
wars
with
poland
sweden
turkey
and
prussia
had
risen
to
an
important
place
among
the
european
nations
austria
which
had
become
more
and
more
a
congeries
of
different
nationalities
fell
before
the
mighty
corsican
prussia
which
seemed
to
have
lost
all
vigour
in
her
dream
of
peace
collapsed
before
his
onslaught
but
the
german
spirit
emerged
with
fresh
strength
from
the
deepest
humiliation
the
purest
and
mightiest
storm
of
fury
against
the
yoke
of
the
oppressor
that
ever

an
enslaved
nation

out

their
glowing
enthusiasm
won
back
the
possibilities
of
political
existence
for
prussia

for

the
assertion
of

rights

individual

ultimately
to
individual
irresponsibility

to
a
repudiation
of

immanuel

founder

opposition
to

view
the
gospel

on

the
future
fate
of

was
to
depend
and

was
being

by

a

up
in
the
domain
of
art
and
science
where

the

expression
a
great
change
had
been
effected
in
this
land
of
political
narrowness
and
social
sterility
since
the
year
a
literature
and
a
science
born
in
the
hearts
of
the
nation
and
deeply
rooted
in
the
moral
teaching
of
protestantism
had
raised
their
minds
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
practical
life
into
the
sunlit
heights
of
intellectual
liberty
and
manifested
the
power
and
superiority
of
the
german
spirit
thus
the
new
poetry

became
for
many

the
most

empire
was
revived
in
a
federal
shape
by
the
triple
alliance
of
germany
austria
and
italy
the
german
idea
as
bismarck
fancied
it
ruled
from
the
north
sea
to
the
adriatic
and
the
mediterranean
like
a
phoenix
from
the
ashes
the
german
giant
rose
from
the
of
the
old
german
confederation
and
stretched
his
mighty
limbs
it
was
an
obvious
and
inevitable
result
that
this
awakening
of
germany
vitally
affected
the
other
nations
which
had
hitherto
divided
the
economic
and
political
power
hostile
combinations
threatened
us
on
all
sides
in
order
to
check
the
further
expansion
of
our
power
hemmed
in
between
france
and
russia
who
allied
themselves
against
us
we
failed
to
gather
the
full
fruits
of
our
victories
the
and
party
feuds
of
the
reichstag
the
old
hereditary
failings
of
our
nation
prevented
any
colonial
policy
on
broad
lines
the
intense
love
of
peace
which
the
nation
and
government
felt
made
us
fall
behind
in
the
race
with
other
countries
in
the
most
recent
partition
of
the
earth
that
of
africa
victorious
germany
came
off
badly
france
her
defeated
opponent
was
able
to
found
the
second
largest
colonial
empire
in
the
world
england
appropriated
the
most
important
portions
even
small
and
neutral
belgium
claimed
a
comparatively
large
and
valuable
share
germany
was
forced
to
be
content
with
some
modest
strips
of
territory
in
addition
to
and
in
connection
with
the
political
changes
new
views
and
new
forces
have
come
forward
under
the
influence
of
the
constitutional
ideas
of
frederick
the
great
and
the
crop
of
new
ideas
borne
by
the
french
revolution
the
conception
of
the
state
has
completely
changed
since
the
turn
of
the
century
the
patrimonial
state
of
the
middle
ages
was
the
hereditary
possession
of
the
sovereign
hence
sprung
the
modern
state
which
represents
the
reverse
of
this
relation
in
which
the
sovereign
is
the
first
servant
of
the
state
and
the
interest
of
the
state
and
not
of
the
ruler
is
the
key
to
the
policy
of
the
government
with
this
altered
conception
of
the
state
the
principle
of
nationality
has
gradually
developed
of
which
the
tendency
is
as
follows
historical
boundaries
are
to
be
disregarded
and
the
nations
combined
into
a
political
whole
the
state
will
thus
acquire
a
uniform
national
character
and
common
national
interests
this
new
order
of
things
entirely
altered
the
basis
of
international
relations
and
set
new
and
unknown
duties
before
the
statesman
commerce
and
trade
also
developed
on
wholly
new
lines
after
the
barriers
to
every
activity
guilds
and
trade
restrictions
were
gradually
removed
landed
property
ceased
to
be
a
monopoly
commerce
and
industries
flourished
conspicuously
england
introduced
the
universal
employment
of
coal
and
iron
and
of
machinery
into
industries
thus
founding
immense
industrial
establishments
by
steamers
and
railways
she
brought
machinery
into
commerce
at
the
same
time
effecting
an
industrial
revolution
by
physical
science
and
chemistry
and
won
the
control
of
the
markets
of
the
world
by
cotton
there
came
besides
the
enormous
extension
of
the
command
of
credit
in
the
widest
sense
the
exploitation
of
india
the
extension
of
colonization
over
polynesia
etc
england
at
the
same
time
girdled
the
earth
with
her
cables
and
fleets
she
thus
attained
to
a
sort
of
she
has
tried
to
found
a
new
universal
empire
not
indeed
by
spiritual
or
secular
weapons
like
pope
and
emperor
in
bygone
days
but
by
the
power
of
money
by
making
all
material
interests
dependent
on
herself
facing
her
between
the
atlantic
and
pacific
oceans
linking
the
west
and
the
east
the
united
states
of
north
america
have
risen
to
be
an
industrial
and
commercial
power
of
the
first
rank
supported
by
exceptionally
abundant
natural
resources
and
the
unscrupulously
pushing
character
of
her
inhabitants
this
mighty
empire
aims
at
a
suitable
recognition
of
her
power
in
the
council
of
the
nations
and
is
on
the
point
of
securing
this
by
the
building
of
a
powerful
navy
russia
has
not
only
strengthened
her
position
in
europe
but
has
extended
her
power
over
the
entire
north
of
asia
and
is
pressing
farther
into
the
centre
of
that
continent
she
has
already
crossed
swords
with
the
states
of
the
mongolian
race
this
vast
population
which
fills
the
east
of
the
asiatic
continent
has
after
thousands
of
years
of
dormant
civilization
at
last
awakened
to
political
life
and
categorically
claims
its
share
in
international
life
the
entrance
of
japan
into
the
circle
of
the
great
world
powers
means
a
call
to
arms
asia
for
the
asiatics
is
the
phrase
which
she
whispers
beneath
her
breath
trusting
in
the
strength
of
her
demand
the
new
great
power
has
emerged
victoriously
from
its
first
encounter
with
a
european
foe
china
too
is
preparing
to
expand
her
forces
outwardly
a
mighty
movement
is
thrilling
asia
the
awakening
of
a
new
epoch
dangers
then
which
have
already
assumed
a
profound
importance
for
the
civilized
countries
of
europe
are
threatening
from
asia
the
old
cradle
of
the
nations
but
even
in
the
heart
of
the
european
nations
forces
which
have
slumbered
hitherto
are
now
awake
the
persisting
ideas
of
the
french
revolution
and
the
great
industrial
progress
which
characterized
the
last
century
have
roused
the
working
classes
of
every
country
to
a
consciousness
of
their
importance
and
their
social
power
the
workers
originally
concerned
only
in
the
amelioration
of
their
material
position
have
in
theory
abandoned
the
basis
of
the
modern
state
and
seek
their
salvation
in
the
revolution
which
they
preach
they
do
not
wish
to
obtain
what
they
can
within
the
limitations
of
the
historically
recognized
state
but
they
wish
to
substitute
for
it
a
new
state
in
which
they
themselves
are
the
rulers
by
this
aspiration
they
not
only
perpetually
menace
state
and
society
but
endanger
in
the
separate
countries
the
industries
from
which
they
live
since
they
threaten
to
destroy
the
possibility
of
competing
in
the
international
markets
by
continuous
increase
of
wages
and
decrease
of
work
even
in
germany
this
movement
has
affected
large
sections
of
the
population
until
approximately
the
middle
of
the
last
century
agriculture
and
formed
the
chief
and
most
important
part
of
german
industries
since
then
under
the
protection
of
wise
tariffs
and
in
connection
with
the
rapid
growth
of
the
german
merchant
navy
trade
has
marvellously
increased
germany
has
become
an
industrial
and
trading
nation
almost
the
whole
of
the
growing
increase
of
the
population
finds
work
and
employment
in
this
sphere
agriculture
has
more
and
more
lost
its
leading
position
in
the
economic
life
of
the
people
the
artisan
class
has
thus
become
a
power
in
our
state
it
is
organized
in
trade
unions
and
has
politically
fallen
under
the
influence
of
the
international
social
democracy
it
is
hostile
to
the
national
class
distinctions
and
strains
every
nerve
to
undermine
the
existing
power
of
the
state
it
is
evident
that
the
state
can
not
tolerate
quietly
this
dangerous
agitation
and
that
it
must
hinder
by
every
means
the
efforts
of
the
party
to
effect
their
purpose
the
law
of
demands
this
but
it
is
clear
that
to
a
certain
point
the
pretensions
of
the
working
classes
are
justified
the
citizen
may
fairly
claim
to
protect
himself
from
poverty
by
work
and
to
have
an
opportunity
of
raising
himself
in
the
social
scale
if
he
willingly
devotes
his
powers
he
is
entitled
to
demand
that
the
state
should
grant
this
claim
and
should
be
bound
to
protect
him
against
the
tyranny
of
capital
two
means
of
attaining
such
an
object
are
open
to
the
state
first
it
may
create
opportunities
of
work
which
secure
remunerative
employment
to
all
willing
hands
secondly
it
may
insure
the
workman
by
legislation
against
every
diminution
in
his
capacity
to
work
owing
to
sickness
age
or
accident
may
give
him
material
assistance
when
temporarily
out
of
work
and
protect
him
against
compulsion
which
may
hinder
him
from
working
the
economical
prosperity
of
germany
as
the
visible
result
of
three
victorious
campaigns
created
a
labour
market
sufficiently
large
for
present
purposes
although
without
the
conscious
intention
of
the
state
german
labour
under
the
protection
of
the
political
power
gained
a
market
for
itself
on
the
other
hand
the
german
state
has
intervened
with
legislation
with
full
consciousness
of
the
end
and
the
means
as
scharnhorst
once
contrasted
the
duty
of
the
citizen
with
the
rights
of
man
so
the
emperor
william
recognized
the
duty
of
the
state
towards
those
who
were
badly
equipped
with
the
necessaries
of
life
the
position
of
the
worker
was
assured
so
far
as
circumstances
allowed
by
social
legislation
no
excuse
therefore
for
revolutionary
agitation
now
existed
a
vigorous
opposition
to
all
the
encroachments
of
the
social
democrats
indicated
the
only
right
way
in
which
the
justifiable
efforts
of
the
working
class
could
be
reconciled
with
the
continuance
of
the
existing
state
and
of
existing
society
the
two
pillars
of
all
civilization
and
progress
this
task
is
by
no
means
completed
the
question
still
is
how
to
win
back
the
working
class
to
the
ideals
of
state
and
country
willing
workers
must
be
still
further
protected
against
social
democratic
tyranny
germany
nevertheless
is
in
respects
at
the
head
of
all
progress
in
culture
german
science
has
held
its
place
in
the
world
germany
certainly
took
the
lead
in
political
sciences
during
the
last
century
and
in
all
other
domains
of
intellectual
inquiry
has
won
a
prominent
position
through
the
universality
of
her
philosophy
and
her
thorough
and
unprejudiced
research
into
the
nature
of
things
the
achievements
of
germany
in
the
sphere
of
science
and
literature
are
attested
by
the
fact
that
the
annual
export
of
german
books
to
foreign
countries
is
according
to
trustworthy
estimates
twice
as
large
as
that
of
france
england
and
america
combined
it
is
only
in
the
domain
of
the
exact
sciences
that
germany
has
often
been
compelled
to
give
precedence
to
foreign
countries
german
art
also
has
failed
to
win
a
leading
position
it
shows
indeed
sound
promise
in
many
directions
and
has
produced
much
that
is
really
great
but
the
chaos
of
our
political
conditions
is
unfortunately
reflected
in
it
the
german
empire
has
politically
been
split
up
into
numerous
parties
not
only
are
the
social
democrats
and
the
middle
class
opposed
but
they
again
are
divided
among
themselves
not
only
are
industries
and
agriculture
bitter
enemies
but
the
national
sentiment
has
not
yet
been
able
to
vanquish
denominational
antagonisms
and
the
historical
hostility
between
north
and
south
has
prevented
the
population
from
growing
into
a
completely
united
body
so
stands
germany
torn
by
internal
dissensions
yet
full
of
sustained
strength
threatened
on
all
sides
by
dangers
compressed
into
narrow
unnatural
limits
she
still
is
filled
with
high
aspirations
in
her
nationality
her
intellectual
development
in
her
science
industries
and
trade
and
now
what
paths
does
this
history
indicate
to
us
for
the
future
what
duties
are
enforced
on
us
by
the
past
it
is
a
question
of
importance
for
on
the
way
in
which
the
german
state
answers
this
question
depend
not
only
our
own
further
development
but
to
some
extent
the
subsequent
shaping
of
the
history
of
the
world
chapter
iv
germany
historical
mission
let
us
pass
before
our
mind
eye
the
whole
course
of
our
historical
development
and
let
us
picture
to
ourselves
the
streams
of
human
beings
that
in
every
age
have
poured
forth
from
the
empire
of
central
europe
to
all
parts
of
the
globe
let
us
reflect
what
rich
seeds
of
intellectual
and
moral
development
were
sown
by
the
german
intellectual
life
the
proud
conviction
forces
itself
upon
us
with
irresistible
power
that
a
high
if
not
the
highest
importance
for
the
entire
development
of
the
human
race
is
ascribable
to
this
german
people
this
conviction
is
based
on
the
intellectual
merits
of
our
nation
on
the
freedom
and
the
universality
of
the
german
spirit
which
have
ever
and
again
been
shown
in
the
course
of
its
history
there
is
no
nation
whose
thinking
is
at
once
so
free
from
prejudice
and
so
historical
as
the
german
which
knows
how
to
unite
so
harmoniously
the
freedom
of
the
intellectual
and
the
restraint
of
the
practical
life
on
the
path
of
free
and
natural
development
the
germans
have
thus
always
been
the
of
free
thought
but
at
the
same
time
a
strong
bulwark
against
revolutionary
anarchical
outbreaks
they
have
often
been
worsted
in
the
struggle
for
intellectual
freedom
and
poured
out
their
best
heart
blood
in
the
cause
intellectual
compulsion
has
sometimes
ruled
the
germans
revolutionary
tremors
have
shaken
the
life
of
this
people
the
great
peasant
war
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
political
attempts
at
revolution
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
revolutionary
movement
has
been
checked
and
directed
into
the
paths
of
a
healthy
natural
advancement
the
inevitable
need
of
a
free
intellectual
has
again
and
again
disengaged
itself
from
the
inner
life
of
the
soul
of
the
people
and
broadened
into
importance
thus
two
great
movements
were
born
from
the
german
intellectual
life
on
which
henceforth
all
the
intellectual
and
moral
progress
of
man
must
rest
the
reformation
and
the
critical
philosophy
the
reformation
which
broke
the
intellectual
yoke
imposed
by
the
church
which
checked
all
free
progress
and
the
critique
of
pure
reason
which
put
a
stop
to
the
caprice
of
philosophic
speculation
by
defining
for
the
human
mind
the
limitations
of
its
capacity
for
knowledge
and
at
the
same
time
pointed
out
in
what
way
knowledge
is
really
possible
on
this
substructure
was
developed
the
intellectual
life
of
our
time
whose
deepest
significance
consists
in
the
attempt
to
reconcile
the
result
of
free
inquiry
with
the
religious
needs
of
the
heart
and
to
lay
a
foundation
for
the
harmonious
organization
of
mankind
torn
this
way
and
that
between
hostile
forces
in
a
continuous
feud
between
faith
and
knowledge
mankind
seems
to
have
lost
the
straight
road
of
progress
reconciliation
only
appears
possible
when
the
thought
of
religious
reformation
leads
to
a
permanent
explanation
of
the
idea
of
religion
and
science
remains
conscious
of
the
limits
of
its
power
and
does
not
attempt
to
explain
the
domain
of
the
supersensual
world
from
the
results
of
natural
philosophy
the
german
nation
not
only
laid
the
foundations
of
this
great
struggle
for
an
harmonious
development
of
humanity
but
took
the
lead
in
it
we
are
thus
incurring
an
obligation
for
the
future
from
which
we
can
not
shrink
we
must
be
prepared
to
be
the
leaders
in
this
campaign
which
is
being
fought
for
the
highest
stake
that
has
been
offered
to
human
efforts
our
nation
is
not
only
bound
by
its
past
history
to
take
part
in
this
struggle
but
is
peculiarly
adapted
to
do
so
by
its
special
qualities
no
nation
on
the
face
of
the
globe
is
so
able
to
grasp
and
appropriate
all
the
elements
of
culture
to
add
to
them
from
the
stores
of
its
own
spiritual
endowment
and
to
give
back
to
mankind
richer
gifts
than
it
received
it
has
enriched
the
store
of
traditional
european
culture
with
new
and
independent
ideas
and
ideals
and
won
a
position
in
the
great
community
of
civilized
nations
which
none
else
could
fill
depth
of
conviction
idealism
universality
the
power
to
look
beyond
all
the
limits
of
a
finite
existence
to
sympathize
with
all
that
is
human
to
traverse
the
realm
of
ideas
in
companionship
with
the
noblest
of
all
nations
and
ages
this
has
at
all
times
been
the
german
characteristic
this
has
been
extolled
as
the
prerogative
of
german
culture
a
to
no
nation
except
the
german
has
it
been
given
to
enjoy
in
its
inner
self
that
which
is
given
to
mankind
as
a
whole
we
often
see
in
other
nations
a
greater
intensity
of
specialized
ability
but
never
the
same
capacity
for
generalization
and
absorption
it
is
this
quality
which
specially
fits
us
for
the
leadership
in
the
intellectual
world
and
imposes
on
us
the
obligation
to
maintain
that
position

borderland
where
science
and
politics
touch
and
where
the
latter
is
often
directly
conditioned
by
the
results
of
scientific
inquiry
first
and
foremost
it
is
german
science
which
must
regain
its
superiority
in
unwearying
and
brilliant
research
in
order
to
vindicate
our
birthright
on
the
one
hand
we
must
extend
the
theory
of
the
perceptive
faculty
on
the
other
we
must
increase
man
dominion
over
nature
by
exploring
her
hidden
secrets
and
thus
make
human
work
more
useful
and
remunerative
we
must
endeavour
to
find
scientific
solutions
of
the
great
problems
which
deeply
concern
mankind
we
need
not
restrict
ourselves
to
the
sphere
of
pure
theory
but
must
try
to
benefit
civilization
by
the
practical
results
of
research
and
thus
create
conditions
of
life
in
which
a
purer
conception
of
the
ideal
life
can
find
its
expression
it
is
broadly
speaking
religious
and
social
controversies
which
exercise
the
most
permanent
influence
on
human
existence
and
condition
not
only
our
future
development
but
the
higher
life
generally
these
problems
have
occupied
the
minds
of
no
people
more
deeply
and
permanently
than
our
own
yet
the
revolutionary
spirit
in
spite
of
the
empty
ravings
of
social
democratic
agitators
finds
no
place
in
germany
the
german
nature
tends
towards
a
systematic
healthy
development
which
works
slowly
in
opposition
to
the
different
movements
the
germans
thus
seem
thoroughly
qualified
to
settle
in
their
own
country
the
great
controversies
which
are
rending
other
nations
and
to
direct
them
into
the
paths
of
a
natural
progress
in
conformity
with
the
laws
of
evolution
we
have
already
started
on
the
task
in
the
social
sphere
and
shall
no
doubt
continue
it
so
far
as
it
is
compatible
with
the
advantages
of
the
community
and
the
working
class
itself
we
must
not
spare
any
efforts
to
find
other
means
than
those
already
adopted
to
inspire
the
working
class
with
healthy
and
patriotic
ambitions
it
is
to
be
hoped
in
any
case
that
if
ever
a
great
and
common
duty
requiring
the
concentration
of
the
whole
national
strength
is
imposed
upon
us
that
the
labour
classes
will
not
withhold
their
and
that
in
face
of
a
common
danger
our
nation
will
recover
that
unity
which
is
lamentably
deficient
no
attempt
at
settlement
has
been
made
in
the
religious
domain
the
old
antagonists
are
still
bitterly
hostile
to
each
other
especially
in
germany
it
will
be
the
duty
of
the
future
to
mitigate
the
religious
and
political
antagonism
of
the
denominations
under
guarantees
of
absolute
liberty
of
thought
and
all
personal
convictions
and
to
combine
the
conflicting
views
into
a
harmonious
and
higher
system
at
present
there
appears
small
probability
of
attaining
this
end
the
dogmatism
of
protestant
orthodoxy
and
the
jesuitic
tendencies
and
ultramontanism
of
the
catholics
must
be
surmounted
before
any
common
religious
movement
can
be
contemplated
but
no
german
statesman
can
disregard
this
aspect
of
affairs
nor
must
he
ever
forget
that
the
greatness
of
our
nation
is
rooted
exclusively
on
protestantism
legally
and
socially
all
denominations
enjoy
equal
rights
but
the
german
state
must
never
renounce
the
leadership
in
the
domain
of
free
spiritual
development
to
do
so
would
mean
loss
of
prestige
duties
of
the
greatest
importance
for
the
whole
advance
of
human
civilization
have
thus
been
transmitted
to
the
german
nation
as
heir
of
a
great
and
glorious
past
it
is
faced
with
problems
of
no
less
significance
in
the
sphere
of
its
international
relations
these
problems
are
of
special
importance
since
they
affect
most
deeply
the
intellectual
development
and
on
their
solution
depends
the
position
of
germany
in
the
world
the
german
empire
has
suffered
great
losses
of
territory
in
the
storms
and
struggles
of
the
past
the
germany
of
considered
geographically
is
a
mutilated
torso
of
the
old
dominions
of
the
emperors
it
comprises
only
a
fraction
of
the
german
peoples
a
large
number
of
german
have
been
incorporated
into
other
states
or
live
in
political
independence
like
the
dutch
who
have
developed
into
a
separate
nationality
but
in
language
and
national
customs
can
not
deny
their
german
ancestry
germany
has
been
robbed
of
her
natural
boundaries
even
the
source
and
mouth
of
the
most
characteristically
german
stream
the
much
lauded
german
rhine
lie
outside
the
german
territory
on
the
eastern
frontier
too
where
the
strength
of
the
modern
german
empire
grew
up
in
centuries
of
war
against
the
slavs
the
possessions
of
germany
are
menaced
the
slavonic
waves
are
ever
dashing
more
furiously
against
the
coast
of
that
germanism
which
seems
to
have
lost
its
old
victorious
strength
signs
of
political
weakness
are
visible
here
while
for
centuries
the
overflow
of
the
strength
of
the
german
nation
has
poured
into
foreign
countries
and
been
lost
to
our
fatherland
and
to
our
nationality
it
is
absorbed
by
foreign
nations
and
steeped
with
foreign
sentiments
even
the
german
empire
possesses
no
colonial
territories
where
its
increasing
population
may
find
remunerative
work
and
a
german
way
of
living
this
is
obviously
not
a
condition
which
can
satisfy
a
powerful
nation
or
corresponds
to
the
greatness
of
the
german
nation
and
its
intellectual
importance
at
an
earlier
epoch
to
be
sure
when
germans
had
in
the
course
of
centuries
grown
accustomed
to
the
degradation
of
being
robbed
of
all
political
significance
a
large
section
of
our
people
did
not
feel
this
insufficiency
even
during
the
age
of
our
classical
literature
the
patriotic
pride
of
that
idealistic
generation
was
contented
with
the
thought
that
no
other
people
could
follow
the
bold
flights
of
german
genius
or
soar
aloft
to
the
freedom
of
our
world
citizenship

the
nobler
and
better
section
of

at
any
rate
holds
different
sentiments
we
attach
a
higher
value
to
the
influence
of
the
german
spirit
on
universal
culture
than
was
then
possible
since
we
must
now
take
into
consideration
the
immense
development
of
germany
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
can
thus
better
estimate
the
old
importance
of
our
classical
literature
again
we
have
learnt
from
the
vicissitudes
of
our
historical
growth
to
recognize
that
the
full
and
due
measure
of
intellectual
development
can
only
be
achieved
by
the
political
federation
of
our
nation
the
dominion
of
german
thought
can
only
be
extended
under
the
aegis
of
political
power
and
unless
we
act
in
conformity
to
this
idea
we
shall
be
untrue
to
our
great
duties
towards
the
human
race
our
first
and
positive
duty
consists
therefore
in
zealously
guarding
the
territories
of
germany
as
they
now
are
and
in
not
surrendering
a
foot
breadth
of
german
soil
to
foreign
nationalities
on
the
west
the
ambitious
schemes
of
the
latin
race
have
been
checked
and
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
we
shall
ever
allow
this
prize
of
victory
to
be
snatched
again
from
our
hands
on
the
the
turks
who
formerly
threatened
the
civilized
countries
of
europe
have
been
completely
repulsed
they
now
take
a
very
different
position
in
european
politics
from
that
which
they
filled
at
the
time
of
their
victorious
advance
westwards
their
power
on
the
mediterranean
is
entirely
destroyed
on
the
other
hand
the
slavs
have
become
a
formidable
power
vast
regions
which
were
once
under
german
influence
are
now
once
more
subject
to
slavonic
rule
and
seem
permanently
lost
to
us
the
present
russian
baltic
provinces
were
formerly
flourishing
seats
of
german
culture
the
german
element
in
austria
our
ally
is
gravely
menaced
by
the
slavs
germany
herself
is
exposed
to
a
perpetual
peaceful
invasion
of
slavonic
workmen
many
poles
are
firmly
established
in
the
heart
of
westphalia
only
measures
are
taken
to
stem
this
slavonic
flood
and
yet
to
check
this
onrush
of
slavism
is
not
merely
an
obligation
inherited
from
our
fathers
but
a
duty
in
the
interests
of
and
european
civilization
it
can
not
yet
be
determined
whether
we
can
keep
off
this
vast
flood
by
pacific
precautions
it
is
not
improbable
that
the
question
of
germanic
or
slavonic
supremacy
will
be
once
more
decided
by
the
sword
the
probability
of
such
a
conflict
grows
stronger
as
we
become
more
lax
in
pacific
measures
of
defence
and
show
less
determination
to
protect
the
german
soil
at
all
costs
the
further
duty
of
supporting
the
germans
in
foreign
countries
in
their
struggle
for
existence
and
of
thus
keeping
them
loyal
to
their
nationality
is
one
from
which
in
our
direct
interests
we
can
not
withdraw
the
isolated
groups
of
germans
abroad
greatly
benefit
our
trade
since
by
preference
they
obtain
their
goods
from
germany
but
they
may
also
be
useful
to
us
politically
as
we
discover
in
america
the
have
formed
a
political
alliance
with
the
irish
and
thus
united
constitute
a
power
in
the
state
with
which
the
government
must
reckon
finally
from
the
point
of
view
of
civilization
it
is
imperative
to
preserve
the
german
spirit
and
by
so
doing
to
establish
of
universal
culture
even
if
we
succeed
in
guarding
our
possessions
in
the
east
and
west
and
in
preserving
the
german
nationality
in
its
present
form
throughout
the
world
we
shall
not
be
able
to
maintain
our
present
position
powerful
as
it
is
in
the
great
competition
with
the
other
powers
if
we
are
contented
to
restrict
ourselves
to
our
present
sphere
of
power
while
the
surrounding
countries
are
busily
extending
their
dominions
if
we
wish
to
compete
further
with
them
a
policy
which
our
population
and
our
civilization
both
entitle
and
compel
us
to
adopt
we
must
not
hold
back
in
the
hard
struggle
for
the
sovereignty
of
the
world
lord
rosebery
speaking
at

royal
colonial
institute
on
march
expressed
himself
as
follows
it
is
said
that
our
empire
is
already
large
enough
and
does
not
need
expansion
we
shall
have
to
consider
not
what
we
want
now
but
what
we
want
in
the
future
we
have
to
remember
that
it
is
part
of
our
responsibility
and
heritage
to
take
care
that
the
world
so
far
as
it
can
be
moulded
by
us
should

that
is
a
great
and
proud
thought
which
the
englishman
then
expressed
if
we
count
the
nations
who
speak
english
at
the
present
day
and
if
we
survey
the
countries
which
acknowledge
the
rule
of
england
we
must
admit
that
he
is
justified
from
the
english
point
of
view
he
does
not
here
contemplate
an
actual
but
the
predominance
of
the
english
spirit
is
proclaimed
in
plain
language
england
has
certainly
done
a
great
work
of
civilization
especially
from
the
material
aspect
but
her
work
is
all
the
colonies
which
are
directly
subject
to
english
rule
are
primarily
exploited
in
the
interest
of
english
industries
and
english
capital
the
work
of
civilization
which
england
undeniably
has
carried
out
among
them
has
always
been
subordinated
to
this
idea
she
has
never
justified
her
sovereignty
by
training
up
a
free
and
independent
population
and
by
transmitting
to
the
subject
peoples
the
blessings
of
an
independent
culture
of
their
own
with
regard
to
those
colonies
which
enjoy
and
are
therefore
more
or
less
free
republics
as
canada
australia
south
africa
it
is
very
questionable
whether
they
will
permanently
retain
any
trace
of
the
english
spirit
they
are
not
only
growing
states
but
growing
nations
and
it
seems
uncertain
at
the
present
time
whether
england
will
be
able
to
include
them
permanently
in
the
empire
to
make
them
serviceable
to
english
industries
or
even
to
secure
that
the
national
character
is
english
nevertheless
it
is
a
great
and
proud
ambition
that
is
expressed
in
lord
rosebery
words
and
it
testifies
to
a
supreme
national
the

no

justifiable
satisfaction
the
work
done
by
them
in
the
last
forty
years

expression
to
this
pride
in

words

the

with
hatred
the
german
policy
it
will
be
for
history
to
decide
what
has
been
the
leading
thought
of
germany
and
her
government
during
the
complicated
disputes
under
which
the
partition
of
africa
and
the
last
phase
of
french
colonial
policy
were
ended
we
may
assume
that
at
first
the
adherents
to
bismarck
policy
saw
with
satisfaction
how
france
embarked
on
distant
and
difficult
undertakings
which
would
fully
occupy
the
attention
of
the
country
and
its
government
for
long
years
to
come
nevertheless
it
is
not
certain
that
this
calculation
has
proved
right
in
the
since
germany
ultimately
trod
the
same
road
and
somewhat
late
indeed
tried
to
make
up
for
lost
time
if
that
country
deliberately
abandoned
colonial
enterprise
to
others
it
can
not
be
surprised
if
these
have
obtained
the
best
shares
this
french
criticism
is
not
altogether
unfair
it
must
be
admitted
with
mortification
and
envy
that
the
nation
vanquished
in
whose
vital
powers
seemed
exhausted
which
possessed
no
qualification
for
colonization
from
want
of
men
to
colonize
as
is
best
seen
in
algeria
has
yet
created
the
second
largest
colonial
empire
in
the
world
and
prides
herself
on
being
a
world
power
while
the
conqueror
of
gravelotte
and
sedan
in
this
respect
lags
far
behind
her
and
only
recently
in
the
morocco
controversy
yielded
to
the
unjustifiable
pretensions
of
france
in
a
way
which
according
to
universal
popular
sentiment
was
unworthy
alike
of
the
dignity
and
the
interests
of
germany
the
openly
declared
claims
of
england
and
france
are
the
more
worthy
of
attention
since
an
prevails
between
the
two
countries
in
the
face
of
these
claims
the
german
nation
from
the
standpoint
of
its
importance
to
civilization
is
fully
entitled
not
only
to
demand
a
place
in
the
sun
as
prince
bülow
used
modestly
to
express
it
but
to
aspire
to
an
adequate
share
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
world
far
beyond
the
limits
of
its
present
sphere
of
influence
but
we
can
only
reach
this
goal
by
so
amply
securing
our
position
in
europe
that
it
can
never
again
be
questioned
then
only
we
need
no
longer
fear
that
we
shall
be
opposed
by
stronger
opponents
whenever
we
take
part
in
international
politics
we
shall
then
be
able
to
exercise
our
forces
freely
in
fair
rivalry
with
the
other
world
powers
and
secure
to
german
nationality
and
german
spirit
throughout
the
globe
that
high
esteem
which
is
due
to
them
such
an
expansion
of
power
befitting
our
importance
is
not
merely
a
fanciful
scheme
it
will
soon
appear
as
a
political
necessity
the
fact
has
already
been
mentioned
that
owing
to
political
union
and
improved
economic
conditions
during
the
last
forty
years
an
era
of
great
prosperity
has
set
in
and
that
german
industries
have
been
widely
extended
and
german
trade
has
kept
pace
with
them
the
extraordinary
capacity
of
the
german
nation
for
trade
and
navigation
has
once
more
brilliantly
asserted
itself
the
days
of
the
hanseatic
league
have
returned
the
labour
resources
of
our
nation
increase
continuously
the
increase
of
the
population
in
the
german
empire
alone
amounts
yearly
to
a
million
souls
and
these
have
to
a
large
extent
found
remunerative
industrial
occupation
there
is
however
a
reverse
side
to
this
picture
of
splendid
development
we
are
absolutely
dependent
on
foreign
countries
for
the
import
of
raw
materials
and
to
a
considerable
extent
also
for
the
sale
of
our
own
manufactures
we
even
obtain
a
part
of
our
necessaries
of
life
from
abroad
then
again
we
have
not
the
assured
markets
which
england
possesses
in
her
colonies
our
own
colonies
are
unable
to
take
much
of
our
products
and
the
great
foreign
economic
spheres
try
to
close
their
doors
to
outsiders
especially
germans
in
order
to
encourage
their
own
industries
and
to
make
themselves
independent
of
other
countries
the
livelihood
of
our
working
classes
directly
depends
on
the
maintenance
and
expansion
of
our
export
trade
it
is
a
question
of
life
and
death
for
us
to
keep
open
our
oversea
commerce
we
shall
very
soon
see
ourselves
compelled
to
find
for
our
growing
population
means
of
life
other
than
industrial
employment
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
this
latter
can
keep
pace
permanently
with
the
increase
of
population
agriculture
will
employ
a
small
part
of
this
increase
and
home
settlements
may
afford
some
relief
but
no
remunerative
occupation
will
ever
be
found
within
the
borders
of
the
existing
german
empire
for
the
whole
population
however
favourable
our
international
relations
we
shall
soon
therefore
be
faced
by
the
question
whether
we
wish
to
surrender
the
coming
generations
to
foreign
countries
as
formerly
in
the
hour
of
our
decline
or
whether
we
wish
to
take
steps
to
find
them
a
home
in
our
own
german
colonies
and
so
retain
them
for
the
fatherland
there
is
no
possible
doubt
how
this
question
must
be
answered
if
the
unfortunate
course
of
our
history
has
hitherto
prevented
us
from
building
a
colonial
empire
it
is
our
duty
to
make
up
for
lost
time
and
at
once
to
construct
a
fleet
which
in
defiance
of
all
hostile
powers
may
keep
our
sea
communications
open
we
have
long
underestimated
the
importance
of
colonies
colonial
possessions
which
merely
serve
the
purpose
of
acquiring
wealth
and
are
only
used
for
economic
ends
while
the
does
not
think
of
colonizing
in
any
form
or
raising
the
position
of
the
aboriginal
population
in
the
economic
or
social
scale
are
unjustifiable
and
immoral
and
can
never
be
held
permanently
but
that
colonization
which
retains
a
uniform
nationality
has
become
a
factor
of
immense
importance
for
the
future
of
the
world
it
will
determine
the
degree
in
which
each
nation
shares
in
the
government
of
the
world
by
the
white
race
it
is
quite
imaginable
that
a
count
owns
no
colonies
will
no
longer
count
among
the
european
great
powers
however
powerful
it
may
otherwise

we
are
already
suffering
severely
from
the
want
of
colonies
to
meet
our
requirements
they
would
not
merely
guarantee
a
livelihood
to
our
growing
working
population
but
would
supply
raw
materials
and
foodstuffs
would
buy
goods
and
open
a
field
of
activity
to
that
immense
capital
of
intellectual
labour
forces
which
is
lying
unproductive
in
germany
or
is
in
the
service
of
foreign
interests
we
find
throughout
the
countries
of
the
world
german
merchants
engineers
and
men
of
every
profession
employed
actively
in
the
service
of
foreign
masters
because
german
colonies
when
they
might
be
profitably
engaged
do
not
exist
in
the
future
however
the
importance
of
germany
will
depend
on
two
points
firstly
how
many
millions
of
men
in
the
world
speak
german
secondly
how
many
of
them
are
politically
members
of
the
german
empire
these
are
heavy
and
complicated
duties
which
have
devolved
on
us
from
the
entire
past
development
of
our
nation
and
are
determined
by
its
present
condition
as
regards
the
future
we
must
be
quite
clear
on
this
point
that
no
nation
has
had
to
reckon
with
the
same
difficulties
and
hostility
as
ours
this
is
due
to
the
many
restrictions
of
our
political
relations
to
our
unfavourable
geographical
position
and
to
the
course
of
our
history
it
was
chiefly
our
own
fault
that
we
were
condemned
to
political
paralysis
at
the
time
when
the
great
european
states
built
themselves
up
and
sometimes
expanded
into
world
powers
we
did
not
enter
the
circle
of
the
powers
whose
decision
carried
weight
in
politics
until
late
when
the
partition
of
the
globe
was
long
concluded
all
which
other
nations
attained
in
centuries
of
natural
development
political
union
colonial
possessions
naval
power
international
trade
was
denied
to
our
nation
until
quite
recently
what
we
now
wish
to
attain
must
be
and
won
against
a
superior
force
of
hostile
interests
and
powers
it
is
all
the
more
emphatically
our
duty
plainly
to
perceive
what
paths
we
wish
to
take
and
what
our
goals
are
so
as
not
to
split
up
our
forces
in
false
directions
and
involuntarily
to
diverge
from
the
straight
road
of
our
intended
development
the
difficulty
of
our
political
position
is
in
a
certain
sense
an
advantage
by
keeping
us
in
a
continually
increasing
state
of
tension
it
has
at
least
protected
us
so
far
from
the
lethargy
which
so
often
follows
a
long
period
of
peace
and
growing
wealth
it
has
forced
us
to
stake
all
our
spiritual
and
material
forces
in
order
to
rise
to
every
occasion
and
has
thus
discovered
and
strengthened
resources
which
will
be
of
great
value

we
shall
be
called
upon
to

in
discussing
the
duties
which
fall
to
the
german
nation
from
its
history
and
its
general
as
well
as
particular
endowments
we
attempted
to
prove
that
a
consolidation
and
expansion
of
our
position
among
the
great
powers
of
europe
and
an
extension
of
our
colonial
possessions
must
be
the
basis
of
our
future
development
the
political
questions
thus
raised
intimately
concern
all
international
relations
and
should
be
thoroughly
weighed
we
must
not
aim
at
the
impossible
a
reckless
policy
would
be
foreign
to
our
national
character
and
our
high
aims
and
duties
but
we
must
aspire
to
the
possible
even
at
the
risk
of
war
this
policy
we
have
seen
to
be
both
our
right
and
our
duty
the
longer
we
look
at
things
with
folded
hands
the
harder
it
will
be
to
make
up
the
start
which
the
other
powers
have
gained
on
us
the
man
of
sense
will
by
the
forelock
clutch
whatever
lies
within
his
power
stick
fast
to
it
and
neither
shirk
nor
from
his
enterprise
be
thrust
but
having
once
begun
to
work
go
working
on
because
he
must
translated
by
sir
theodore
martin
the
sphere
in
which
we
can
realize
our
ambition
is
circumscribed
by
the
hostile
intentions
of
the
other
world
powers
by
the
existing
territorial
conditions
and
by
the
armed
force
which
is
at
the
back
of
both
our
policy
must
necessarily
be
determined
by
the
consideration
of
these
conditions
we
must
accurately
and
without
bias
or
timidity
examine
the
circumstances
which
turn
the
scale
when
the
forces
which
concern
us
are
weighed
one
against
the
other
these
considerations
fall
partly
within
the
military
but
belong
mainly
to
the
political
sphere
in
so
far
as
the
political
grouping
of
the
states
allows
a
survey
of
the
military
resources
of
the
parties
we
must
try
to
realize
this
grouping
the
shifting
aims
of
the
politics
of
the
day
need
not
be
our
standard
they
are
often
coloured
by
considerations
of
present
expediency
and
offer
no
firm
basis
for
forming
an
opinion
we
must
rather
endeavour
to
recognize
the
political
views
and
intentions
of
the
individual
states
which
are
based
on
the
nature
of
things
and
therefore
will
continually
make
their
importance
felt
the
broad
lines
of
policy
are
ultimately
laid
down
by
the
permanent
interests
of
a
country
although
they
may
often
be
mistaken
from
or
timidity
and
although
policy
sometimes
takes
a
course
which
does
not
seem
warranted
from
the
standpoint
of
lasting
national
benefits
policy
is
not
an
exact
science
following
necessary
laws
but
is
made
by
men
who
impress
on
it
the
stamp
of
their
strength
or
their
weakness
and
often
divert
it
from
the
path
of
true
national
interests
such
digressions
must
not
be
ignored
the
statesman
who
seizes
his
opportunity
will
often
profit
by
these
political
fluctuations
but
the
student
who
considers
matters
from
the
standpoint
of
history
must
keep
his
eyes
mainly
fixed
on
those
interests
which
seem
permanent
we
must
therefore
try
to
make
the
international
situation
in
this
latter
sense
clear
so
far
as
it
concerns
germany
power
and
ambitions
we
see
the
european
great
powers
divided
into
two
great
camps
on
the
one
side
germany
austria
and
italy
have
concluded
a
defensive
alliance
whose
sole
object
is
to
guard
against
hostile
aggression
in
this
alliance
the
two
states
form
the
solid
probably
unbreakable
core
since
by
the
nature
of
things
they
are
intimately
connected
the
geographical
conditions
force
this
result
the
two
states
combined
form
a
compact
series
of
territories
from
the
adriatic
to
the
north
sea
and
the
baltic
their
close
union
is
due
also
to
historical
national
and
political
conditions
austrians
have
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
prussians
and
germans
of
the
empire
on
a
hundred
battlefields
germans
are
the
backbone
of
the
austrian
dominions
the
bond
of
union
that
holds
together
the
different
nationalities
of
the
empire
austria
more
than
germany
must
guard
against
the
inroads
of
slavism
since
numerous
slavonic
races
are
comprised
in
her
territories
there
has
been
no
conflict
of
interests
between
the
two
states
since
the
struggle
for
the
supremacy
in
germany
was
decided
the
maritime
and
commercial
interests
of
the
one
point
to
the
south
and
those
of
the
other
to
the
north
any
feebleness
in
the
one
must
react
detrimentally
on
the
political
relations
of
the
other
a
quarrel
between
germany
and
austria
would
leave
both
states
at
the
mercy
of
overwhelmingly
powerful
enemies
the
possibility
of
each
maintaining
its
political
position
depends
on
their
standing
by
each
other
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
relations
uniting
the
two
states
will
be
permanent
so
long
as
germans
and
magyars
are
the
leading
nationalities
in
the
danubian
monarchy
it
was
one
of
the
of
bismarck
policy
to
have
recognized
the
community
of
interests
even
during
the
war
of
and
boldly
to
have
concluded
a
peace
which
rendered
such
an
alliance
possible
the
weakness
of
the
austrian
empire
lies
in
the
strong
admixture
of
slavonic
elements
which
are
hostile
to
the
german
population
and
show
many
signs
of
it
is
not
at
present
however
strong
enough
to
influence
the
political
position
of
the
empire
italy
also
is
bound
to
the
triple
alliance
by
her
true
interests
the
antagonism
to
austria
which
has
run
through
italian
history
will
diminish
when
the
needs
of
expansion
in
other
spheres
and
of
creating
a
natural
channel
for
the
increasing
population
are
fully
recognized
by
italy
neither
condition
is
impossible
irredentism
will
then
lose
its
political
significance
for
the
position
which
belongs
to
italy
from
her
geographical
situation
and
her
past
history
and
will
promote
her
true
interests
if
attained
can
not
be
won
in
a
war
with
austria
it
is
the
position
of
a
leading
political
and
commercial
mediterranean
power
that
is
the
natural
heritage
which
she
can
claim
neither
germany
nor
austria
is
a
rival
in
this
claim
but
france
since
she
has
taken
up
a
permanent
position
on
the
coast
of
north
africa
and
especially
in
tunis
has
appropriated
a
country
which
would
have
been
the
most
natural
colony
for
italy
and
has
in
point
of
fact
been
largely
colonized
by
italians
it
would
in
my
opinion
have
been
politically
right
for
us
even
at
the
risk
of
a
war
with
france
to
protest
against
this
annexation
and
to
preserve
the
territory
of
carthage
for
italy
we
should
have
considerably
strengthened
italy
position
on
the
mediterranean
and
created
a
cause
of
contention
between
italy
and
france
that
would
have
added
to
the
security
of
the
triple
alliance
the
weakness
of
this
alliance
consists
in
its
purely
defensive
character
it
offers
a
certain
security
against
hostile
aggression
but
does
not
consider
the
necessary
development
of
events
and
does
not
guarantee
to
any
of
its
members
help
in
the
prosecution
of
its
essential
interests
it
is
based
on
a
which
was
fully
justified
in
its
day
but
has
been
left
far
behind
by
the
march
of
political
events
prince
bismarck
in
his
thoughts
and
reminiscences
pointed
out
that
this
alliance
would
not
always
correspond
to
the
requirements
of
the
future
since
italy
found
the
triple
alliance
did
not
aid
her
mediterranean
policy
she
tried
to
effect
a
pacific
agreement
with
england
and
france
and
accordingly
retired
from
the
triple
alliance
the
results
of
this
policy
are
manifest
italy
under
an
undisguised
arrangement
with
england
and
france
but
in
direct
opposition
to
the
interests
of
the
triple
alliance
attacked
turkey
in
order
to
conquer
in
tripoli
the
required
colonial
territory
this
undertaking
brought
her
to
the
brink
of
a
war
with
austria
which
as
the
supreme
power
in
the
balkan
peninsula
can
never
tolerate
the
encroachment
of
italy
into
those
regions
the
triple
alliance
which
in
itself
represents
a
natural
league
has
suffered
a
rude
shock
the
ultimate
reason
for
this
result
is
found
in
the
fact
that
the
parties
concerned
with
a
narrow
policy
look
only
to
their
immediate
private
interests
and
pay
no
regard
to
the
vital
needs
of
the
members
of
the
league
the
alliance
will
not
regain
its
original
strength
until
under
the
protection
of
the
allied
armies
each
of
the
three
states
can
satisfy
its
political
needs
we
must
therefore
be
solicitous
to
promote
austria
position
in
the
balkans
and
italy
interests
on
the
mediterranean
only
then
can
we
calculate
on
finding
in
our
allies
assistance
towards
realizing
our
own
political
endeavours
since
however
it
is
against
all
our
interests
to
strengthen
italy
at
the
cost
of
turkey
which
is
as
we
shall
see
an
essential
member
of
the
triple
alliance
we
must
repair
the
errors
of
the
past
and
in
the
next
great
war
win
back
tunis
for
italy
only
then
will
bismarck
great
conception
of
the
triple
alliance
reveal
its
real
meaning
but
the
triple
alliance
so
long
as
it
only
aims
at
negative
results
and
leaves
it
to
the
individual
allies
to
pursue
their
vital
interests
exclusively
by
their
own
resources
will
be
smitten
with
sterility
on
the
surface
italy
mediterranean
interests
do
not
concern
us
closely
but
their
real
importance
for
us
is
shown
by
the
consideration
that
the
withdrawal
of
italy
from
the
triple
alliance
or
indeed
its
secession
to
an
would
probably
be
the
signal
for
a
great
european
war
against
us
and
austria
such
a
development
would
gravely
prejudice
the
lasting
interests
of
italy
for
she
would
forfeit
her
political
independence
by
so
doing
and
incur
the
risk
of
sinking
to
a
sort
of
vassal
state
of
france
such
a
contingency
is
not
unthinkable
for
in
judging
the
policy
of
italy
we
must
not
disregard
her
relations
with
england
as
well
as
with
france
england
is
clearly
a
hindrance
in
the
way
of
italy
justifiable
efforts
to
win
a
prominent
position
in
the
mediterranean
she
possesses
in
gibraltar
malta
cyprus
egypt
and
aden
a
chain
of
strong
bases
which
secure
the
to
india
and
she
has
an
unqualified
interest
in
commanding
this
great
road
through
the
mediterranean
mediterranean
fleet
is
correspondingly
strong
and
would
especially
in
combination
with
the
french
mediterranean
squadron
seriously
menace
the
coasts
of
italy
should
that
country
be
entangled
in
a
war
against
england
france
italy
is
therefore
obviously
concerned
in
avoiding
such
a
war
as
long
as
the
balance
of
maritime
power
is
unchanged
she
is
thus
in
an
extremely
difficult
double
position
herself
a
member
of
the
triple
alliance
she
is
in
a
situation
which
compels
her
to
make
overtures
to
the
opponents
of
that
alliance
so
long
as
her
own
allies
can
afford
no
trustworthy
assistance
to
her
policy
of
development
it
is
our
interest
to
reconcile
italy
and
turkey
so
far
as
we
can
france
and
russia
have
united
in
opposition
to
the
central
european
triple
alliance
france
european
policy
is
overshadowed
by
the
idea
of
for
that
she
makes
the
most
painful
sacrifices
for
that
she
has
forgotten
the
hundred
years
enmity
against
england
and
the
humiliation
of
fashoda
she
wishes
first
to
take
vengeance
for
the
defeats
of
which
wounded
her
national
pride
to
the
quick
she
wishes
to
raise
her
political
prestige
by
a
victory
over
germany
and
if
possible
to
regain
that
former
supremacy
on
the
continent
of
europe
which
she
so
long
and
brilliantly
maintained
she
wishes
if
fortune
smiles
on
her
arms
to
reconquer
alsace
and
lorraine
but
she
feels
too
weak
for
an
attack
on
germany
her
whole
foreign
policy
in
spite
of
all
protestations
of
peace
follows
the
single
aim
of
gaining
allies
for
this
attack
her
alliance
with
russia
her
with
england
are
inspired
with
this
spirit
her
present
intimate
relations
with
this
latter
nation
are
traceable
to
the
fact
that
the
french
policy
hoped
and
with
good
reason
for
more
active
help
from
england
hostility
to
germany
than
from
russia
the
colonial
policy
of
france
pursues
primarily
the
object
of
acquiring
a
material
and
if
possible
military
superiority
over
germany
the
establishment
of
a
native
african
army
the
contemplated
introduction
of
a
modified
system
of
conscription
in
algeria
and
the
political
annexation
of
morocco
which
offers
excellent
raw
material
for
soldiers
so
clearly
exhibit
this
intention
that
there
can
be
no
possible
illusion
as
to
its
extent
and
meaning
since
france
has
succeeded
in
bringing
her
military
strength
to
approximately
the
same
level
as
germany
since
she
has
acquired
in
her
north
african
empire
the
possibility
of
considerably
increasing
that
strength
since
she
has
completely
outstripped
germany
in
the
sphere
of
colonial
policy
and
has
not
only
kept
up
but
also
revived
the
french
sympathies
of
alsace
and
lorraine
the
conclusion
is
obvious
france
will
not
abandon
the
paths
of
an
policy
but
will
do
her
best
to
excite
hostility
against
us
and
to
thwart
german
interests
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
when
she
came
to
an
understanding
with
the
italians
that
she
should
be
given
a
free
hand
in
morocco
if
she
allowed
them
to
occupy
tripoli
a
wedge
was
driven
into
the
triple
alliance
which
threatens
to
split
it
it
may
be
regarded
as
highly
improbable
that
she
will
maintain
honourably
and
with
no
the
obligations
undertaken
in
the
interests
of
german
commerce
in
morocco
the
suppression
of
these
interests
was
in
fact
a
marked
feature
of
the
french
morocco
policy
which
was
conspicuously
the
french
policy
was
so
successful
that
we
shall
have
to
reckon
more
than
ever
on
the
hostility
of
france
in
the
future
it
must
be
regarded
as
a
quite
unthinkable
proposition
that
an
agreement
between
france
and
germany
can
be
negotiated
before
the
question
between
them
has
been
once
more
decided
by
arms
such
an
agreement
is
the
less
likely
now
that
france
sides
with
england
to
whose
interest
it
is
to
repress
germany
but
strengthen
france
another
picture
meets
our
eyes
if
we
turn
to
the
east
where
the
giant
russian
empire
towers
above
all
others
the
empire
of
the
czar
in
consequence
of
its
defeat
in
manchuria
and
of
the
revolution
which
was
precipitated
by
the
disastrous
war
is
following
apparently
a
policy
of
recuperation
it
has
tried
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
japan
in
the
far
east
and
with
england
in
central
asia
in
the
balkans
its
policy
aims
at
the
maintenance
of
the
so
far
it
does
not
seem
to
have
entertained
any
idea
of
war
with
germany
the
potsdam
agreement
whose
importance
can
not
be
overestimated
shows
that
we
need
not
anticipate
at
present
any
aggressive
policy
on
russia
part
the
ministry
of
kokowzew
seems
likely
to
wish
to
continue
this
policy
of
recuperation
and
has
the
more
reason
for
doing
so
as
the
murder
of
stolypin
with
its
accompanying
events
showed
as
it
were
by
a
flash
of
lightning
a
dreadful
picture
of
internal
disorder
and
revolutionary
intrigue
it
is
improbable
therefore
that
russia
would
now
be
inclined
to
make
armed
intervention
in
favour
of
france
the
alliance
is
not
indeed
swept
away
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
russia
would
if
the
necessity
arose
meet
her
obligations
but
the
tension
has
been
temporarily
relaxed
and
an
improvement
in
the
relations
has
been
effected
although
this
state
of
things
was
sufficiently
well
paid
for
by
the
concessions
of
germany
in
north
persia
it
is
quite
obvious
that
this
policy
of
marking
time
which
russia
is
adopting
for
the
moment
can
only
be
transitory
the
requirements
of
the
mighty
empire
irresistibly
compel
an
expansion
towards
the
sea
whether
in
the
far
east
where
it
hopes
to
gain
harbours
or
in
the
direction
of
the
mediterranean
where
the
crescent
still
glitters
on
the
dome
of
sophia
after
a
successful
war
russia
would
hardly
hesitate
to
seize
the
mouth
of
the
vistula
at
the
possession
of
which
she
has
long
aimed
and
thus
to
strengthen
appreciably
her
position
in
the
baltic
supremacy
in
the
balkan
peninsula
free
entrance
into
the
mediterranean
and
a
strong
position
on
the
baltic
are
the
goals
to
which
the
european
policy
of
russia
has
naturally
long
been
directed
she
feels
herself
also
the
leading
power
of
the
slavonic
races
and
has
for
many
years
been
busy
in
encouraging
and
extending
the
spread
of
this
element
into
central
europe
is
still
hard
at
work
it
is
hard
to
foresee
how
soon
russia
will
come
out
from
her
retirement
and
again
tread
the
natural
paths
of
her
international
policy
her
present
political
attitude
depends
considerably
on
the
person
of
the
present
emperor
who
believes
in
the
need
of
leaning
upon
a
strong
monarchical
state
such
as
germany
is
and
also
on
the
character
of
the
internal
development
of
the
mighty
empire
the
whole
body
of
the
nation
is
so
tainted
with
revolutionary
and
moral
infection
and
the
peasantry
is
plunged
in
such
economic
disorder
that
it
is
difficult
to
see
from
what
elements
a
vivifying
force
may
spring
up
capable
of
restoring
a
healthy
condition
even
the
agrarian
policy
of
the
present
government
has
not
produced
any
favourable
results
and
has
so
far
disappointed
expectations
the
possibility
thus
has
always
existed
that
under
the
stress
of
internal
affairs
the
foreign
policy
may
be
reversed
and
an
attempt
made
to
surmount
the
difficulties
at
home
by
successes
abroad
time
and
events
will
decide
whether
these
successes
will
be
sought
in
the
far
east
or
in
the
west
on
the
one
side
japan
and
possibly
china
must
be
encountered
on
the
other
germany
austria
and
possibly
turkey
doubtless
these
conditions
must
exercise
a
decisive
influence
on
the
alliance
the
interests
of
the
two
allies
are
not
identical
while
france
aims
solely
at
crushing
germany
by
an
aggressive
war
russia
from
the
first
has
more
defensive
schemes
in
view
she
wished
to
secure
herself
against
any
interference
by
the
powers
of
central
europe
in
the
execution
of
her
political
plans
in
the
south
and
east
and
at
the
same
time
at
the
price
of
an
alliance
to
raise
on
advantageous
terms
in
france
the
loans
which
were
so
much
needed
russia
at
present
has
no
inducement
to
seek
an
aggressive
war
with
germany
or
to
take
part
in
one
of
course
every
further
increase
of
the
german
power
militates
against
the
russian
interests
we
shall
therefore
always
find
her
on
the
side
of
those
who
try
to
cross
our
political
paths
england
has
recently
associated
herself
with
the
alliance
she
has
made
an
arrangement
in
asia
with
russia
by
which
the
spheres
of
influence
of
the
two
parties
are
delimited
while
with
france
she
has
come
to
terms
in
the
clear
intention
of
suppressing
germany
under
all
circumstances
if
necessary
by
force
of
arms
the
actually
existing
conflict
of
russian
and
english
interests
in
the
heart
of
asia
can
obviously
not
be
terminated
by
such
agreements
so
also
no
natural
community
of
interests
exists
between
england
and
france
a
strong
french
fleet
may
be
as
great
a
menace
to
england
as
to
any
other
power
for
the
present
however
we
may
reckon
on
an
anglo
french
this
union
is
cemented
by
the
common
hostility
to
germany
no
other
reason
for
the
political
combination
of
the
two
states
is
forthcoming
there
is
not
even
a
credible
pretext
which
might
mask
the
real
objects
this
policy
of
england
is
on
superficial
examination
not
very
comprehensible
of
course
german
industries
and
trade
have
lately
made
astounding
progress
and
the
german
navy
is
growing
to
a
strength
which
commands
respect
we
are
certainly
a
hindrance
to
the
plans
which
england
is
prosecuting
in
asiatic
turkey
and
central
africa
this
may
well
be
distasteful
to
the
english
from
economic
as
well
as
political
and
military
aspects
but
on
the
other
hand
the
american
competition
in
the
domain
of
commercial
politics
is
far
keener
than
the
german
the
american
navy
is
at
the
present
moment
stronger
than
the
german
and
will
henceforth
maintain
this
precedence
even
the
french
are
on
the
point
of
building
a
formidable
fleet
and
their
colonial
empire
so
far
as
territory
is
concerned
is
immensely
superior
to
ours
yet
in
spite
of
all
these
considerations
the
hostility
of
the
english
is
primarily
directed
against
us
it
is
necessary
to
adopt
the
english
standpoint
in
order
to
understand
the
line
of
thought
which
guides
the
english
politicians
i
believe
that
the
solution
of
the
problem
is
to
be
found
in
the
wide
ramifications
of
english
interests
in
every
part
of
the
world
since
england
committed
the
unpardonable
blunder
from
her
point
of
view
of
not
supporting
the
southern
states
in
the
american
war
of
secession
a
rival
to
england
empire
has
appeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
in
the
form
of
the
united
states
of
north
america
which
are
a
grave
menace
to
england
fortunes
the
keenest
competition
conceivable
now
exists
between
the
two
countries
the
annexation
of
the
philippines
by
america
and
england
treaty
with
japan
have
accentuated
the
conflict
of
interests
between
the
two
nations
the
trade
and
industries
of
america
can
no
longer
be
checked
and
the
absolutely
inexhaustible
and
resources
of
the
union
are
so
prodigious
that
a
naval
war
with
america
in
view
of
the
vast
distances
and
wide
extent
of
the
enemies
coasts
would
prove
a
very
bold
and
certainly
very
difficult
undertaking
england
accordingly
has
always
diplomatically
conceded
the
claims
of
america
as
quite
recently
in
the
negotiations
about
fortifying
the
panama
canal
the
object
clearly
is
to
avoid
any
collision
with
the
united
states
from
fearing
the
consequences
of
such
collision
the
american
competition
in
trade
and
industries
and
the
growth
of
the
american
navy
are
tolerated
as
inevitable
and
the
community
of
race
is
borne
in
mind
in
this
sense
according
to
the
english
point
of
view
must
be
understood
the
treaty
by
which
a
court
of
arbitration
between
the
two
countries
was
established
england
wishes
in
any
case
to
avert
the
danger
of
a
war
with
america
the
natural
opposition
of
the
two
rival
states
may
however
in
the
further
development
of
things
be
so
accentuated
that
england
will
be
forced
to
assert
her
position
by
arms
or
at
least
to
maintain
an
undisputed
naval
supremacy
in
order
to
emphasize
her
diplomatic
action
the
relations
of
the
two
countries
to
canada
may
easily
become
strained
to
a
dangerous
point
and
the
temporary
failure
of
the
arbitration
treaty
casts
a
strong
light
on
the
fact
that
the
american
people
does
not
consider
that
the
present
political
relations
of
the
two
nations
are
permanent
there
is
another
danger
which
concerns
england
more
closely
and
directly
threatens
her
vitality
this
is
due
to
the
nationalist
movement
in
india
and
egypt
to
the
growing
power
of
islam
to
the
agitation
for
independence
in
the
great
colonies
as
well
as
to
the
supremacy
of
the
element
in
south
africa
turkey
is
the
only
state
which
might
seriously
threaten
the
english
position
in
egypt
by
land
this
contingency
gives
to
the
national
movement
in
egypt
an
importance
which
it
would
not
otherwise
possess
it
clearly
shows
that
england
intensely
fears
every
movement
she
is
trying
with
all
the
resources
of
political
intrigue
to
undermine
the
growing
power
of
turkey
which
she
officially
pretends
to
support
and
is
endeavouring
to
create
in
arabia
a
new
religious
centre
in
opposition
to
the
caliphate
the
same
views
are
partially
responsible
for
the
policy
in
india
where
some
seventy
millions
of
moslems
live
under
the
english
rule
england
so
far
in
accordance
with
the
principle
of
et
has
attempted
to
play
off
the
mohammedan
against
the
hindu
population
but
now
that
a
pronounced
revolutionary
and
nationalist
tendency
shows
itself
among
these
latter
the
danger
is
imminent
that
thoroughly
roused
should
unite
with
the
revolutionary
elements
of
bengal
the
of
these
elements
might
create
a
very
grave
danger
capable
of
shaking
the
foundations
of
england
high
position
in
the
world
while
so
many
dangers
in
the
future
at
least
threaten
both
at
home
and
abroad
english
imperialism
has
failed
to
link
the
vast
empire
together
either
for
purposes
of
commerce
or
defence
more
closely
than
hitherto
chamberlain
dream
of
the
british
imperial

definitely
been
abandoned
no
attempt
was
made
at
the
imperial
conference
in
to
go
back
to
it
a
centrifugal
policy
predominated
when
the
question
of
imperial
defence
came
up
the
policy
was
rejected
which
wished
to
assure
to
great
britain
the
help
of
the
oversea

in
every
imaginable
eventuality
the
great

will

clear

that
the
policy
of

though
not
yet
planning
a
separation
from

is
contemplating
the

prospect
of
doing
so
canada

australia
are
developing
as
mentioned
in

into
independent
nations
and

and
will
when
their
time
comes

footnote
a
th

in
the
of

all
these
circumstances
constitute
a
grave
menace
to
the
stability
of
england
empire
and
these
dangers
largely
influence
england
attitude
towards
germany
england
may
have
to
tolerate
the
rivalry
of
north
america
in
her
imperial
and
commercial
ambitions
but
the
competition
of
germany
must
be
stopped
if
england
is
forced
to
fight
america
the
german
fleet
must
not
be
in
a
position
to
help
the
americans
therefore
it
must
be
destroyed
a
similar
line
of
thought
is
suggested
by
the
eventuality
of
a
great
english
colonial
war
which
would
engage
england
fleets
in
far
distant
parts
of
the
world
england
knows
the
german
needs
and
capabilities
of
expansion
and
may
well
fear
that
a
german
empire
with
a
strong
fleet
might
use
such
an
opportunity
for
obtaining
that
increase
of
territory
which
england
grudges
we
may
thus
explain
the
apparent
indifference
of
england
to
the
french
schemes
of
aggrandizement
france
capability
of
expansion
is
exhausted
from
insufficient
increase
of
population
she
can
no
longer
be
dangerous
to
england
as
a
nation
and
would
soon
fall
victim
to
english
lust
of
empire
if
only
germany
were
conquered
the
wish
to
get
rid
of
the
dangers
presumably
threatening
from
the
german
quarter
is
all
the
more
real
since
geographical
conditions
offer
a
prospect
of
crippling
the
german
overseas
commerce
without
any
excessive
efforts
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
german
fleet
contrasted
with
the
vast
superiority
of
the
english
navy
allows
a
correspondingly
easy
victory
to
be
anticipated
especially
if
the
french
fleet
the
possibility
therefore
of
quickly
and
completely
getting
rid
of
one
rival
in
order
to
have
a
free
hand
for
all
other
contingencies
looms
very
near
and
undoubtedly
presents
a
practicable
means
of
placing
the
naval
power
of
england
on
a
firm
footing
for
years
to
come
of
annihilating
german
commerce
and
of
checking
the
importance
of
german
interests
in
africa
and
northern
asia
the
hostility
to
germany
is
also
sufficiently
evident
in
other
matters
it
has
always
been
england
object
to
maintain
a
certain
balance
of
power
between
the
continental
nations
of
europe
and
to
prevent
any
one
of
them
attaining
a
pronounced
supremacy
while
these
states
crippled
and
hindered
each
other
from
playing
any
active
part
on
the
stage
england
acquired
an
opportunity
of
following
out
her
own
purposes
undisturbed
and
of
founding
that
world
empire
which
she
now
holds
this
policy
she
still
continues
for
so
long
as
the
powers
of
europe
tie
each
other
hands
her
own
supremacy
is
uncontested
it
follows
directly
from
this
that
england
aim
must
be
to
repress
germany
but
strengthen
france
for
germany
at
the
present
moment
is
the
only
european
state
which
threatens
to
win
a
commanding
position
but
france
is
her
born
rival
and
can
not
keep
on
level
terms
with
her
stronger
neighbour
on
the
east
unless
she
adds
to
her
forces
and
is
helped
by
her
allies
thus
the
hostility
to
germany
from
this
aspect
also
is
based
on
most
important
interests
and
we
must
treat
it
as
axiomatic
and
the
argument
is
often
adduced
that
england
by
a
war
with
germany
would
chiefly
injure
herself
since
she
would
lose
the
german
market
which
is
the
best
purchaser
of
her
industrial
products
and
would
be
deprived
of
the
very
considerable
german
import
trade
i
fear
that
from
the
english
point
of
view
these
conditions
would
be
an
additional
incentive
to
war
england
would
hope
to
acquire
in
place
of
the
lost
german
market
a
large
part
of
those
markets
which
had
been
supplied
by
germany
before
the
war
and
the
want
of
german
imports
would
be
a
great
stimulus
and
to
some
extent
a
great
benefit
to
english
industries
after
all
it
is
from
the
english
aspect
of
the
question
quite
comprehensible
that
the
english
government
strains
every
nerve
to
check
the
growing
power
of
germany
and
that
a
passionate
desire
prevails
in
large
circles
of
the
english
nation
to
destroy
the
german
fleet
which
is
building
and
attack
the
objectionable
neighbour
english
policy
might
however
strike
out
a
different
line
and
attempt
to
come
to
terms
with
germany
instead
of
fighting
this
would
be
the
most
desirable
course
for
us
a
triple
alliance
germany
england
and
america
has
been
suggested
b
but
for
such
a
union
with
germany
to
be
possible
england
must
have
resolved
to
give
a
free
course
to
german
development
side
by
side
with
her
own
to
allow
the
enlargement
of
our
colonial
power
and
to
offer
no
political
hindrances
to
our
commercial
and
industrial
competition
she
must
therefore
have
renounced
her
traditional
policy
and
contemplate
an
entirely
new
grouping
of
the
great
powers
in
the

we

publicists

no

this
no
similar

based

has
at

arisen
from
the
ambitions
of
the
two

certainly
not
in
the
sphere
of
politics
so
far
as
can
be
seen
an
understanding
with

ought
to
further
the
interests
of

it
is
unlikely
that
the

would
welcome
any
considerable
addition
to

such
would
be
the
case
if
great
britain
succeeded
in
inflicting

for
a
time
it
seemed
as
if
the

would
definitely
end
in
an
alliance
against

there
has
at
any
rate
been
a
great
and
widespread
agitation
against
us
in
the
united

the
americans
of
german
and
irish
stock
resolutely
opposed
it
and
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
movement
in
the
united
states
was
a
passing
phase
with
no
real
foundation
in
the
nature
of
things
in
the
field
of
commerce
there
is
no
doubt
keen
competition
between
the
two
countries
especially
in
south
america
there
is
however
no
reason
to
assume
that
this
will
lead
to
political
complications
japan
has
for
the
time
being
a
direct
political
interest
for
us
only
in
her
influence
on
the
affairs
of
russia
america
england
and
china
in
the
far
east
since
japan
has
formed
an
alliance
with
england
and
seems
recently
to
have
effected
an
arrangement
with
russia
we
have
to
count
more
on
japanese
hostility
than
japanese
friendship
her
attitude
to
china
may
prove
exceptionally
important
to
our
colonial
possessions
in
east
asia
if
the
two
nations
joined
hands
a
hardly
probable
eventuality
at
present
it
would
become
difficult
for
us
to
maintain
an
independent
position
between
them
the
political
rivalry
between
the
two
nations
of
yellow
race
must
therefore
be
kept
alive
if
they
are
antagonistic
they
will
both
probably
look
for
help
against
each
other
in
their
relations
with
europe
and
thus
enable
the
european
powers
to
retain
their
possessions
in
asia
while
the
aspiring
great
powers
of
the
far
east
can
not
at
present
directly
influence
our
policy
turkey
the
predominant
power
of
the
near
east
is
of
paramount
importance
to
us
she
is
our
natural
ally
it
is
emphatically
our
interest
to
keep
in
close
touch
with
her
the
wisest
course
would
have
been
to
have
made
her
earlier
a
member
of
the
triple
alliance
and
so
to
have
prevented
the
war
which
threatens
to
change
the
whole
political
situation
to
our
disadvantage
turkey
would
gain
in
two
ways
she
assures
her
position
both
against
russia
and
against
england
the
two
states
that
is
with
whose
hostility
we
have
to
reckon
turkey
also
is
the
only
power
which
can
threaten
england
position
in
egypt
and
thus
menace
the
short
and
the
land
communications
to
india
we
ought
to
spare
no
sacrifices
to
secure
this
country
as
an
ally
for
the
eventuality
of
a
war
with
england
or
russia
turkey
interests
are
ours
it
is
also
to
the
obvious
advantage
of
italy
that
turkey
maintain
her
commanding
position
on
the
bosphorus
and
at
the
dardanelles
that
this
important
key
should
not
be
transferred
to
the
keeping
of
foreigners
and
belong
to
russia
or
england
if
russia
gained
the
access
to
the
mediterranean
to
which
she
has
so
long
aspired
she
would
soon
become
a
prominent
power
in
its
eastern
basin
and
thus
greatly
damage
the
italian
projects
in
those
waters
since
the
english
interests
also
would
be
prejudiced
by
such
a
development
the
english
fleet
in
the
mediterranean
would
certainly
be
strengthened
between
england
france
and
russia
it
would
be
quite
impossible
for
italy
to
attain
an
independent
or
commanding
position
while
the
opposition
of
russia
and
turkey
leaves
the
field
open
to
her
from
this
view
of
the
question
therefore
it
is
advisable
to
end
the
conflict
and
to
try
and
satisfy
the
justifiable
wishes
of
italy
at
the
cost
of
france
after
the
next
war
it
may
be
spain
alone
of
the
remaining
european
powers
has
any
independent
importance
she
has
developed
a
certain
antagonism
to
france
by
her
morocco
policy
and
may
therefore
become
eventually
a
factor
in
german
policy
the
petty
states
on
the
contrary
form
no
independent
centres
of
gravity
but
may
in
event
of
war
prove
to
possess
a
by
no
means
negligible
importance
the
small
balkan
states
for
austria
and
turkey
denmark
holland
belgium
and
switzerland
and
eventually
sweden
for
germany
switzerland
and

footnote
c
by

is
understood
the
of
the
contracting
powers
to
take
steps
to
protect
this
neutrality
when
all
agree
that
it
is
menaced
each
individual
power
has
the
to
interfere
if
it
considers
the
neutrality
menaced
if
we
look
at
these
conditions
as
a
whole
it
appears
that
on
the
continent
of
europe
the
power
of
the
central
european
triple
alliance
and
that
of
the
states
united
against
it
by
alliance
and
agreement
balance
each
other
provided
that
italy
belongs
to
the
league
if
we
take
into
calculation
the
imponderabilia
whose
weight
can
only
be
guessed
at
the
scale
is
inclined
slightly
in
favour
of
the
triple
alliance
on
the
other
hand
england
indisputably
rules
the
sea
in
consequence
of
her
crushing
naval
superiority
when
allied
with
france
and
of
the
geographical
conditions
she
may
cause
the
greatest
damage
to
germany
by
cutting
off
her
maritime
trade
there
is
also
a
not
inconsiderable
army
available
for
a
continental
war
when
all
considerations
are
taken
into
account
our
opponents
have
a
political
superiority
not
to
be
underestimated
if
france
succeeds
in
strengthening
her
army
by
large
colonial
levies
and
a
strong
english
this
superiority
would
be
asserted
on
land
also
if
italy
really
withdraws
from
the
triple
alliance
very
distinctly
superior
forces
will
be
united
against
germany
and
austria
under
these
conditions
the
position
of
germany
is
extraordinarily
difficult
we
not
only
require
for
the
full
material
development
of
our
nation
on
a
scale
corresponding
to
its
intellectual
importance
an
extended
political
basis
but
as
explained
in
the
previous
chapter
we
are
compelled
to
obtain
space
for
our
increasing
population
and
markets
for
our
growing
industries
but
at
every
step
which
we
take
in
this
direction
england
will
resolutely
oppose
us
english
policy
may
not
yet
have
made
the
definite
decision
to
attack
us
but
it
doubtless
wishes
by
all
and
every
means
even
the
most
extreme
to
hinder
every
further
expansion
of
german
international
influence
and
of
german
maritime
power
the
recognized
political
aims
of
england
and
the
attitude
of
the
english
government
leave
no
doubt
on
this
point
but
if
we
were
involved
in
a
struggle
with
england
we
can
be
quite
sure
that
france
would
not
neglect
the
opportunity
of
attacking
our
flank
italy
with
her
extensive
even
if
still
a
member
of
the
triple
alliance
will
have
to
devote
large
forces
to
the
defence
of
the
coast
to
keep
off
the
attacks
of
the
mediterranean
fleet
and
would
thus
be
only
able
to
employ
weaker
forces
against
france
austria
would
be
paralyzed
by
russia
against
the
latter
we
should
have
to
leave
forces
in
the
east
we
should
thus
have
to
fight
out
the
struggle
against
france
and
england
practically
alone
with
a
part
of
our
army
perhaps
with
some
support
from
italy
it
is
in
this
double
menace
by
sea
and
on
the
mainland
of
europe
that
the
grave
danger
to
our
political
position
lies
since
all
freedom
of
action
is
taken
from
us
and
all
expansion
barred
since
the
struggle
is
as
appears
on
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
international
question
necessary
and
inevitable
we
must
fight
it
out
cost
what
it
may
indeed
we
are
carrying
it
on
at
the
present
moment
though
not
with
drawn
swords
and
only
by
peaceful
means
so
far
on
the
one
hand
it
is
being
waged
by
the
competition
in
trade
industries
and
warlike
preparations
on
the
other
hand
by
diplomatic
methods
with
which
the
rival
states
are
fighting
each
other
in
every
region
where
their
interests
clash
with
these
methods
it
has
been
possible
to
maintain
peace
hitherto
but
not
without
considerable
loss
of
power
and
prestige
this
apparently
peaceful
state
of
things
must
not
deceive
us
we
are
facing
a
hidden
but
none
the
less
formidable
crisis
perhaps
the
most
momentous
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
german
nation
we
have
fought
in
the
last
great
wars
for
our
national
union
and
our
position
among
the
powers
of
we
now
must
decide
whether
we
wish
to
develop
into
and
maintain
a
and
procure
for
german
spirit
and
german
ideas
that
fit
recognition
which
has
been
hitherto
withheld
from
them
have
we
the
energy
to
aspire
to
that
great
goal
are
we
prepared
to
make
the
sacrifices
which
such
an
effort
will
doubtless
cost
us
or
are
we
willing
to
recoil
before
the
hostile
forces
and
sink
step
by
step
lower
in
our
economic
political
and
national
importance
that
is
what
is
involved
in
our
decision
to
be
or
not
to
be
is
the
question
which
is
put
to
us
disguised
indeed
by
the
apparent
equilibrium
of
the
opposing
interests
and
forces
by
the
deceitful
shifts
of
diplomacy
and
the
official
of
all
the
states
but
by
the
logic
of
history
inexorably
demanding
an
answer
if
we
look
with
clear
gaze
beyond
the
narrow
horizon
of
the
day
and
the
mere
surface
of
things
into
the
region
of
realities
there
is
no
standing
still
in
the
world
history
all
is
growth
and
development
it
is
obviously
impossible
to
keep
things
in
the
as
diplomacy
has
so
often
attempted
no
true
statesman
will
ever
seriously
count
on
such
a
possibility
he
will
only
make
the
outward
and
temporary
maintenance
of
existing
conditions
a
duty
when
he
wishes
to
gain
time
and
deceive
an
opponent
or
when
he
can
not
see
what
is
the
trend
of
events
he
will
use
such
diplomatic
means
only
as
inferior
tools
in
reality
he
will
only
reckon
with
actual
forces
and
with
the
powers
of
a
continuous
development
we
must
make
it
quite
clear
to
ourselves
that
there
can
be
no
standing
still
no
being
satisfied
for
us
but
only
progress
or
retrogression
and
that
it
is
tantamount
to
retrogression
when
we
are
contented
with
our
present
place
among
the
nations
of
europe
while
all
our
rivals
are
straining
with
desperate
energy
even
at
the
cost
of
our
rights
to
extend
their
power
the
process
of
our
decay
would
set
in
gradually
and
advance
slowly
so
long
as
the
struggle
against
us
was
waged
with
peaceful
weapons
the
living
generation
would
perhaps
be
able
to
continue
to
exist
in
peace
and
comfort
but
should
a
war
be
forced
upon
us
by
stronger
enemies
under
conditions
unfavourable
to
us
then
if
our
arms
met
with
disaster
our
political
downfall
would
not
be
delayed
and
we
should
rapidly
sink
down
the
future
of
german
nationality
would
be
sacrificed
an
independent
german
civilization
would
not
long
exist
and
the
blessings
for
which
german
blood
has
flowed
in
streams
spiritual
and
moral
liberty
and
the
profound
and
lofty
aspirations
of
german
thought
would
for
long
ages
be
lost
to
mankind
if
as
is
right
we
do
not
wish
to
assume
the
responsibility
for
such
a
catastrophe
we
must
have
the
courage
to
strive
with
every
means
to
attain
that
increase
of
power
which
we
are
entitled
to
claim
even
at
the
risk
of
a
war
with
numerically
superior
foes
under
present
conditions
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
attempt
this
by
acquiring
territory
in
europe
the
region
in
the
east
where
german
colonists
once
settled
is
lost
to
us
and
could
only
be
recovered
from
russia
by
a
long
and
victorious
war
and
would
then
be
a
perpetual
incitement
to
renewed
wars
so
again
the
reannexation
of
the
former
south
prussia
which
was
united
to
prussia
on
the
second
partition
of
poland
would
be
a
serious
undertaking
on
account
of
the
polish
population
under
these
circumstances
we
must
clearly
try
to
strengthen
our
political
power
in
other
ways
in
the
first
place
our
political
position
would
be
considerably
consolidated
if
we
could
finally
get
rid
of
the
standing
danger
that
france
will
attack
us
on
a
favourable
occasion
so
soon
as
we
find
ourselves
involved
in
complications
elsewhere
in
one
way
or
another
must
square
our
account
with
if
we
wish
for
a
free
hand
in
our
international
policy
this
is
the
first
and
foremost
condition
of
a
sound
german
policy
and
since
the
hostility
of
france
once
for
all
can
not
be
removed
by
peaceful
overtures
the
matter
must
be
settled
by
force
of
arms
france
must
be
so
completely
crushed
that
she
can
never
again
come
across
our
path
further
we
must
contrive
every
means
of
strengthening
the
political
power
of
our
allies
we
have
already
followed
such
a
policy
in
the
case
of
austria
when
we
declared
our
readiness
to
protect
if
necessary
with
armed
intervention
the
final
annexation
of
bosnia
and
herzegovina
by
our
ally
on
the
danube
our
policy
towards
italy
must
follow
the
same
lines
especially
if
in
any
war
an
opportunity
should
be
presented
of
doing
her
a
really
valuable
service
it
is
equally
good
policy
in
every
way
to
support
turkey
whose
importance
for
germany
and
the
triple
alliance
has
already
been
discussed
our
political
duties
therefore
are
complicated
and
during
the
war
all
that
we
can
do
at
first
is
to
use
our
influence
as
mediators
and
to
prevent
a
transference
of
hostilities
to
the
balkan
peninsula
it
can
not
be
decided
at
this
moment
whether
further
intervention
will
be
necessary
finally
as
regards
our
own
position
in
europe
we
can
only
effect
an
extension
of
our
own
political
influence
in
my
opinion
by
awakening
in
our
weaker
neighbours
through
the
integrity
and
firmness
of
our
policy
the
conviction
that
their
independence
and
their
interests
are
bound
up
with
germany
and
are
best
secured
under
the
protection
of
the
german
arms
this
conviction
might
eventually
lead
to
an
enlargement
of
the
triple
alliance
into
a
central
european
federation
our
military
strength
in
central
europe
would
by
this
means
be
considerably
increased
and
the
extraordinarily
unfavourable
geographical
configuration
of
our
dominions
would
be
essentially
improved
in
case
of
war
such
a
federation
would
be
the
expression
of
a
natural
community
of
interests
which
is
founded
on
the
geographical
and
natural
conditions
and
would
insure
the
durability
of
the
political
community
based
on
it
we
must
employ
other
means
also
for
the
widening
of
our
colonial
territory
so
that
it
may
be
able
to
receive
the
overflow
of
our
population
very
recent
events
have
shown
that
under
certain
circumstances
it
is
possible
to
obtain
districts
in
equatorial
africa
by
pacific
negotiations
a
financial
or
political
crash
in
portugal
might
give
us
the
opportunity
to
take
possession
of
a
portion
of
the
portuguese
colonies
we
may
assume
that
some
understanding
exists
between
england
and
germany
which
contemplates
a
division
of
the
portuguese
colonial
possessions
but
has
never
become
it
can
not
indeed
be
certain
that
england
if
the
contingency
arrives
would
be
prepared
honestly
to
carry
out
such
a
treaty
if
it
actually
exists
she
might
find
ways
and
means
to
invalidate
it
it
has
even
been
often
said
although
disputed
in
other
quarters
that
great
britain
after
coming
to
an
agreement
with
germany
about
the
partition
of
the
portuguese
colonies
had
by
a
special
convention
guaranteed
portugal
the
possession
of
her
colonies
other
possible
schemes
may
be
imagined
by
which
some
extension
of
our
african
territory
would
be
possible
these
need
not
be
discussed
here
more
particularly
if
necessary
they
must
be
obtained
as
the
result
of
a
successful
european
war
in
all
these
possible
acquisitions
of
territory
the
point
must
be
strictly
borne
in
mind
that
we
require
countries
which
are
climatically
suited
to
german
settlers
now
there
are
even
in
central
africa
large
regions
which
are
adapted
to
the
settlement
of
german
farmers
and
and
part
of
our
overflow
population
might
be
diverted
to
those
parts
but
generally
speaking
we
can
only
obtain
in
tropical
colonies
markets
for
our
industrial
products
and
wide
stretches
of
cultivated
ground
for
the
growth
of
the
raw
materials
which
our
industries
require
this
represents
in
itself
a
considerable
advantage
but
does
not
release
us
from
the
obligation
to
acquire
land
for
actual
colonization
a
part
of
our
surplus
population
indeed
so
far
as
present
conditions
point
will
always
be
driven
to
seek
a
livelihood
outside
the
borders
of
the
german
empire
measures
must
be
taken
to
the
extent
at
least
of
providing
that
the
german
element
is
not
split
up
in
the
world
but
remains
united
in
compact
blocks
and
thus
forms
even
in
foreign
countries
political
centres
of
gravity
in
our
favour
markets
for
our
exports
and
centres
for
the
diffusion
of
german
culture
an
intensive
colonial
policy
is
for
us
especially
an
absolute
necessity
it
has
often
been
asserted
that
a
policy
of
the
open
door
can
replace
the
want
of
colonies
of
our
own
and
must
constitute
our
programme
for
the
future
just
because
we
do
not
possess
sufficient
colonies
this
notion
is
only
justified
in
a
certain
sense
in
the
first
place
such
a
policy
does
not
offer
the
possibility
of
finding
homes
for
the
overflow
population
in
a
territory
of
our
own
next
it
does
not
guarantee
the
certainty
of
an
open
and
unrestricted
trade
competition
it
secures
to
all
trading
nations
equal
tariffs
but
this
does
not
imply
by
any
means
competition
under
equal
conditions
on
the
contrary
the
political
power
which
is
exercised
in
such
a
country
is
the
determining
factor
in
the
economic
relations
the
principle
of
the
open
door
prevails
everywhere
in
egypt
manchuria
in
the
congo
state
in
morocco
and
everywhere
the
politically
dominant
power
controls
the
commerce
in
manchuria
japan
in
egypt
england
in
the
congo
state
belgium
and
in
morocco
france
the
reason
is
plain
all
state
concessions
fall
naturally
to
that
state
which
is
practically
dominant
its
products
are
bought
by
all
the
consumers
who
are
any
way
dependent
on
the
power
of
the
state
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
by
reduced
tariffs
and
similar
advantages
for
the
favoured
wares
the
concession
of
the
open
door
can
be
evaded
in
various
ways
a
policy
of
the
open
door
must
at
best
be
regarded
as
a
makeshift
and
as
a
complement
of
a
vigorous
colonial
policy
the
essential
point
is
for
a
country
to
have
colonies
or
its
own
and
a
predominant
political
influence
in
the
spheres
where
its
markets
lie
our
german
world
policy
must
be
guided
by
these
considerations
the
execution
of
such
political
schemes
would
certainly
clash
with
many
notions
and
vested
rights
of
the
traditional
european
policy
in
the
first
place
the
principle
of
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
which
has
since
the
congress
of
vienna
led
an
almost
sacrosanct
but
entirely
unjustifiable
existence
must
be
entirely
disregarded
the
idea
of
a
balance
of
power
was
gradually
developed
from
the
feeling
that
states
do
not
exist
to
thwart
each
other
but
to
work
together
for
the
advancement
of
culture
christianity
which
leads
man
beyond
the
limits
of
the
state
to
a
world
citizenship
of
the
noblest
kind
and
lays
the
foundation
of
all
international
law
has
exercised
a
wide
influence
in
this
respect
practical
interests
too
have
strengthened
the
theory
of
balance
of
power
when
it
was
understood
that
the
state
was
a
power
and
that
by
its
nature
it
must
strive
to
extend
that
power
a
certain
guarantee
of
peace
was
supposed
to
exist
in
the
balance
of
forces
the
conviction
was
thus
gradually
established
that
every
state
had
a
close
community
of
interests
with
the
other
states
with
which
it
entered
into
political
and
economic
relations
and
was
bound
to
establish
some
sort
of
understanding
with
them
thus
the
idea
grew
up
in
europe
of
a
which
was
formed
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
by
the
five
great
powers
england
france
russia
austria
and
prussia
which
latter
had
gained
a
place
in
the
first
rank
by
force
of
arms
in
italy
joined
it
as
the
sixth
great
power
such
a
system
can
not
be
supported
with
an
approximate
equilibrium
among
the
nations
all
theory
must
rest
on
the
basis
of
practice
and
a
real
equilibrium
an
actual
equality
of
power
is
postulated
d
this
condition
does
not
exist
between
the
european
nations
england
by
herself
rules
the
sea
and
the
of
germans
can
not
allow
themselves
to
sink
to
the
same
level
of
power
as
the
of
french
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
produce
a
real
equilibrium
by
special
alliances
one
result
only
has
been
obtained
the
hindrance
of
the
free
development
of
the
nations
in
general
and
of
germany
in
particular
this
is
an
unsound
condition
a
european
balance
of
power
can
no
longer
be
termed
a
condition
which
corresponds
to
the
existing
state
of
things
it
can
only
have
the
disastrous
consequences
of
rendering
the
forces
of
the
continental
european
states
mutually
ineffective
and
of
thus
favouring
the
plans
of
the
political
powers
which
stand
outside
that
charmed
circle
it
has
always
been
policy
to
stir
up
enmity
between
the
respective
continental
states
and
to
keep
them
at
approximately
the
same
standard
of
power
in
order
herself
undisturbed
to
conquer
at
once
the
sovereignty
of
the
seas
and
the
sovereignty
of
the
world
footnote
d
treitschke
we
must
put
aside
all
such
notions
of
equilibrium
in
its
present
distorted
form
it
is
opposed
to
our
weightiest
interests
the
idea
of
a
state
system
which
has
common
interests
in
civilization
must
not
of
course
be
abandoned
but
it
must
be
expanded
on
a
new
and
more
just
basis
it
is
now
not
a
question
of
a
european
state
system
but
of
one
embracing
all
the
states
in
the
world
in
which
the
equilibrium
is
established
on
real
factors
of
power
we
must
endeavour
to
obtain
in
this
system
our
merited
position
at
the
head
of
a
federation
of
central
european
states
and
thus
reduce
the
imaginary
european
equilibrium
in
one
way
or
the
other
to
its
true
value
and
correspondingly
to
increase
our
own
power
a
further
question
suggested
by
the
present
political
position
is
whether
all
the
political
treaties
which
were
concluded
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
under
quite
other
conditions
in
fact
under
a
different
conception
of
what
constitutes
a
state
can
or
ought
to
be
permanently
observed
when
belgium
was
proclaimed
neutral
no
one
contemplated
that
she
would
lay
claim
to
a
large
and
valuable
region
of
africa
it
may
well
be
asked
whether
the
acquisition
of
such
territory
is
not
a
breach
of
neutrality
for
a
state
from
which
theoretically
at
least
all
danger
of
war
has
been
removed
has
no
right
to
enter
into
political
competition
with
the
other
states
this
argument
is
the
more
justifiable
because
it
may
safely
be
assumed
that
in
event
of
a
war
of
germany
against
france
and
england
the
two
last
mentioned
states
would
try
to
unite
their
forces
in
belgium
lastly
the
neutrality
of
the
congo
state
e
must
be
termed
more
than
problematic
since
belgium
claims
the
right
to
cede
or
sell
it
to
a
country
the
conception
of
permanent
neutrality
is
entirely
contrary
to
the
essential
nature
of
the
state
which
can
only
attain
its
highest
moral
aims
in
competition
with
other
states
its
complete
development
presupposes
such
competition
footnote
e
the
congo
state
was
proclaimed
neutral
but
without
guarantees
by
acts
of
february
again
the
principle
that
no
state
can
ever
interfere
in
the
internal
affairs
of
another
state
is
repugnant
to
the
highest
rights
of
the
state
this
principle
is
of
course
very
variously
interpreted
and
powerful
states
have
never
refrained
from
a
interference
in
the
internal
affairs
of
smaller
ones
we
daily
witness
instances
of
such
conduct
indeed
england
quite
lately
attempted
to
interfere
in
the
private
affairs
of
germany
not
formally
or
by
diplomatic
methods
but
none
the
less
in
point
of
fact
on
the
subject
of
our
naval
preparations
it
is
however
accepted
as
a
principle
of
international
intercourse
that
between
the
states
of
one
and
the
same
political
system
a
strict
in
home
affairs
should
be
observed
the
unqualified
recognition
of
this
principle
and
its
application
to
political
intercourse
under
all
conditions
involves
serious
difficulties
it
is
the
doctrine
of
the
liberals
which
was
first
preached
in
france
in
and
of
which
the
english
ministry
of
lord
palmerston
availed
themselves
for
their
own
purpose
equally
false
is
the
doctrine
of
unrestricted
intervention
as
promulgated
by
the
states
of
the
holy
alliance
at
troppau
in
no
fixed
principles
for
international
politics
can
be
laid
down
after
all
the
relation
of
states
to
each
other
is
that
of
individuals
and
as
the
individual
can
decline
the
interference
of
others
in
his
affairs
so
naturally
the
same
right
belongs
to
the
state
above
the
individual
however
stands
the
authority
of
the
state
which
regulates
the
relations
of
the
citizens
to
each
other
but
no
one
stands
above
the
state
which
regulates
the
relations
of
the
citizens
to
each
other
but
no
one
stands
above
the
state
it
is
sovereign
and
must
itself
decide
whether
the
internal
conditions
or
measures
of
another
state
menace
its
own
existence
or
interests
in
no
case
therefore
may
a
sovereign
state
renounce
the
right
of
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
other
states
should
circumstances
demand
cases
may
occur
at
any
time
when
the
party
disputes
or
the
preparations
of
the
neighboring
country
becomes
a
threat
to
the
existence
of
a
state
it
can
only
be
asserted
that
every
state
acts
at
its
own
risk
when
it
interferes
in
the
internal
affairs
of
another
state
and
that
experience
shows
how
very
dangerous
such
an
interference
may
become
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
dangers
which
may
arise
from
are
occasionally
still
graver
and
that
the
whole
discussion
turns
not
on
an
international
right
but
simply
and
solely
on
power
and
expediency
i
have
gone
closely
into
these
questions
of
international
policy
because
under
conditions
which
are
not
remote
they
may
greatly
influence
the
realization
of
our
necessary
political
aspirations
and
may
give
rise
to
hostile
complications
then
it
becomes
essential
that
we
do
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
cramped
in
our
freedom
of
action
by
considerations
devoid
of
any
inherent
political
necessity
which
only
depend
on
political
expediency
and
are
not
binding
on
us
we
must
remain
conscious
in
all
such
eventualities
that
we
can
not
under
any
circumstances
avoid
fighting
for
our
position
in
the
world
and
that
the
point
is
not
to
postpone
that
war
as
long
as
possible
but
to
bring
it
on
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
possible
no
man
so
wrote
frederick
the
great
to
pitt
on
july
if
he
has
a
grain
of
sense
will
leave
his
enemies
leisure
to
make
all
preparations
in
order
to
destroy
him
he
will
rather
take
advantage
of
his
start
to
put
himself
in
a
favourable
position
if
we
wish
to
act
in
this
spirit
of
prompt
and
effective
policy
which
guided
the
great
heroes
of
our
past
we
must
learn
to
concentrate
our
forces
and
not
to
dissipate
them
in
centrifugal
efforts
the
political
and
national
development
of
the
german
people
has
always
so
far
back
as
german
history
extends
been
hampered
and
hindered
by
the
hereditary
defects
of
its
character
that
is
by
the
particularism
of
the
individual
races
and
states
the
theoretic
dogmatism
of
the
parties
the
incapacity
to
sacrifice
personal
interests
for
great
national
objects
from
want
of
patriotism
and
of
political
common
sense
often
also
by
the
pettiness
of
the
prevailing
ideas
even
it
is
painful
to
see
how
the
forces
of
the
german
nation
which
are
so
restricted
and
confined
in
their
activities
abroad
are
wasted
in
fruitless
quarrels
among
themselves
our
primary
and
most
obvious
moral
and
political
duty
is
to
overcome
these
hereditary
failings
and
to
lay
a
secure
foundation
for
a
healthy
consistent
development
of
our
power
it
must
not
be
denied
that
the
variety
of
forms
of
intellectual
and
social
life
arising
from
the
like
variety
of
the
german
nationality
and
political
system
offers
valuable
advantages
it
presents
countless
centres
for
the
advancement
of
science
art
technical
skill
and
a
high
spiritual
and
material
way
of
life
in
a
steadily
increasing
development
but
we
must
resist
the
converse
of
these
conditions
the
transference
of
this
richness
in
variety
and
contrasts
into
the
domain
of
politics
above
all
must
we
endeavour
to
confirm
and
consolidate
the
institutions
which
are
calculated
to
counteract
and
concentrate
the
centrifugal
forces
of
the
german
nature
the
common
system
of
defence
of
our
country
by
land
and
sea
in
which
all
party
feeling
is
merged
and
a
strong
national
empire
no
people
is
so
little
qualified
as
the
german
to
direct
its
own
destinies
whether
in
a
parliamentarian
or
republican
constitution
to
no
people
is
the
customary
liberal
pattern
so
inappropriate
as
to
us
a
glance
at
the
reichstag
will
show
how
completely
this
conviction
which
is
forced
on
us
by
a
study
of
german
history
holds
good
the
german
people
has
always
been
incapable
of
great
acts
for
the
common
interest
except
under
the
irresistible
pressure
of
external
conditions
as
in
the
rising
of
or
under
the
leadership
of
powerful
personalities
who
knew
how
to
arouse
the
enthusiasm
of
the
masses
to
stir
the
german
spirit
to
its
depths
to
vivify
the
idea
of
nationality
and
force
conflicting
aspirations
into
concentration
and
union
we
must
therefore
take
care
that
such
men
are
assured
the
possibility
of
acting
with
a
confident
and
free
hand
in
order
to
accomplish
great
ends
through
and
for
our
people
within
these
limits
it
is
in
harmony
with
the
national
german
character
to
allow
personality
to
have
a
free
course
for
the
fullest
development
of
all
individual
forces
and
capacities
of
all
spiritual
scientific
and
artistic
aims
every
extension
of
the
activities
of
the
state
is
beneficial
and
wise
if
it
arouses
promotes
and
purifies
the
independence
of
free
and
reasoning
men
it
is
evil
when
it
kills
and
stunts
the
independence
of
free
men
f
this
independence
of
the
individual
within
the
limits
marked
out
by
the
interests
of
the
state
forms
the
necessary
complement
of
the
wide
expansion
of
the
central
power
and
assures
an
ample
scope
to
a
liberal
development
of
all
our
social

the
social
and
political
significance
of
arming
for
war
germany
has
great
national
and
historical
duties
of
policy
and
culture
to
fulfil
and
her
path
towards
further
progress
is
threatened
by
formidable
enmities
if
we
realize
this
we
shall
see
that
it
will
be
impossible
to
maintain
our
present
position
and
secure
our
future
without
an
appeal
to
arms
knowing
this
as
every
man
must
who
impartially
considers
the
political
situation
we
are
called
upon
to
prepare
ourselves
as
well
as
possible
for
this
war
the
times
are
passed
when
a
stamp
of
the
foot
raised
an
army
or
when
it
was
sufficient
to
levy
the
masses
and
lead
them
to
battle
the
armaments
of
the
present
day
must
be
prepared
in
down
to
the
smallest
detail
if
they
are
to
be
effective
in
time
of
need
although
this
fact
is
known
the
sacrifices
which
are
required
for
warlike
preparations
are
no
longer
so
willingly
made
as
the
gravity
of
the
situation
demands
every
military
proposal
is
bitterly
contested
in
the
reichstag
frequently
in
a
very
petty
spirit
and
no
one
seems
to
understand
that
an
unsuccessful
war
would
involve
our
nation
in
economic
misery
with
which
the
most
burdensome
charges
for
the
army
and
these
for
the
most
part
come
back
again
into
the
coffers
of
the
country
can
not
for
an
instant
be
compared
a
victorious
war
on
the
other
hand
brings
countless
advantages
to
the
conqueror
and
as
our
last
great
wars
showed
forms
a
new
departure
in
economic
progress
the
fact
is
often
forgotten
that
military
service
and
the
observance
of
the
national
duty
of
bearing
arms
are
in
themselves
a
high
moral
gain
for
our
people
and
improve
the
strength
and
capacity
for
work
nor
can
it
be
ignored
that
a
nation
has
other
than
merely
economic
duties
to
discharge
i
propose
to
discuss
the
question
what
kind
and
degree
of
preparation
for
war
the
great
historical
crisis
through
which
we
are
passing
demands
from
us
first
however
it
will
be
profitable
to
consider
the
importance
of
preparations
for
war
generally
and
not
so
much
from
the
purely
military
as
from
the
social
and
political
aspect
we
shall
thus
strengthen
the
conviction
that
we
can
not
serve
the
true
interests
of
the
country
better
than
by
improving
its
military
capabilities
preparation
for
war
has
a
double
task
to
discharge
firstly
it
must
maintain
and
raise
the
military
capabilities
of
the
nation
as
a
national
asset
and
secondly
it
must
make
arrangements
for
the
conduct
of
the
war
and
supply
the
requisite
means
this
capability
of
national
defence
has
a
pronounced
educative
value
in
national
development
as
in
the
social
competition
the
persons
able
to
protect
themselves
hold
the
field
the
persons
that
is
who
well
equipped
intellectually
do
not
shirk
the
contest
but
fight
it
out
with
confidence
and
certainty
of
victory
so
in
the
rivalry
of
nations
and
states
victory
rests
with
the
people
able
to
defend
itself
which
boldly
enters
the
lists
and
is
capable
of
wielding
the
sword
with
success
military
service
not
only
educates
nations
in
warlike
capacity
but
it
develops
the
intellectual
and
moral
qualities
generally
for
the
occupations
of
peace
it
educates
a
man
to
the
full
mastery
of
his
body
to
the
exercise
and
improvement
of
his
muscles
it
develops
his
mental
powers
his
and
readiness
of
decision
it
accustoms
him
to
order
and
subordination
for
a
common
end
it
elevates
his
and
courage
and
thus
his
capacity
for
every
kind
of
work
it
is
a
quite
perverted
view
that
the
time
devoted
to
military
service
deprives
economic
life
of
forces
which
could
have
been
more
appropriately
and
more
profitably
employed
elsewhere
these
forces
are
not
withdrawn
from
economic
life
but
are
trained
for
economic
life
military
training
produces
intellectual
and
moral
forces
which
richly
repay
the
time
spent
and
have
their
real
value
in
subsequent
life
it
is
therefore
the
moral
duty
of
the
state
to
train
as
many
of
its
countrymen
as
possible
in
the
use
of
arms
not
only
with
the
prospect
of
war
but
that
they
may
share
in
the
benefits
of
military
service
and
improve
their
physical
and
moral
capacities
of
defence
the
sums
which
the
state
applies
to
the
military
training
of
the
nation
are
distinctly
an
outlay
for
social
purposes
the
money
so
spent
serves
social
and
educative
ends
and
raises
the
nation
spiritually
and
morally
it
thus
promotes
the
highest
aims
of
civilization
more
directly
than
achievements
of
mechanics
industries
trades
and
commerce
which
certainly
discharge
the
material
duties
of
culture
by
improving
the
national
livelihood
and
increasing
national
wealth
but
bring
with
them
a
number
of
dangers
such
as
craving
for
pleasure
and
tendency
to
luxury
thus
slackening
the
moral
and
productive
fibres
of
the
nations
military
service
as
an
educational
instrument
stands
on
the
same
level
as
the
school
and
as
will
be
shown
in
a
later
section
each
must
complete
and
assist
the
other
but
a
people
which
does
not
willingly
bear
the
duties
and
sacrifices
entailed
by
school
and
military
service
renounces
its
will
to
live
and
sacrifices
objects
which
are
noble
and
assure
the
future
for
the
sake
of
material
advantages
which
are
and
evanescent
it
is
the
duty
therefore
of
every
state
conscious
of
its
obligations
towards
civilization
and
society
remorselessly
to
put
an
end
to
all
tendencies
inimical
to
the
full
development
of
the
power
of
defence
the
method
by
which
the
maintenance
and
promotion
of
this
defensive
power
can
be
practically
carried
out
admits
of
great
variety
it
depends
largely
on
the
conditions
of
national
life
on
the
geographical
and
political
circumstances
as
well
as
on
past
history
and
consequently
ranges
between
very
wide
extremes
in
the
boer
states
as
among
most
uncivilized
peoples
the
military
training
was
almost
exclusively
left
to
the
individual
that
was
sufficient
to
a
certain
point
since
their
method
of
life
in
itself
made
them
familiar
with
carrying
arms
and
with
riding
and
inured
them
to
hard
bodily
exertions
the
higher
requirements
of
combination
subordination
and
campaigning
could
not
be
met
by
such
a
military
system
and
the
consequences
of
this
were
felt
disastrously
in
the
conduct
of
the
war
in
switzerland
and
other
states
an
attempt
is
made
to
secure
national
defence
by
a
system
of
militia
and
to
take
account
of
political
possibilities
the
great
european
states
maintain
standing
armies
in
which
all
citizens
have
to
pass
a
longer
or
shorter
period
of
military
training
england
alone
keeps
up
a
mercenary
army
and
by
the
side
of
it
a
territorial
army
whose
ranks
are
filled
by
volunteers
in
these
various
ways
different
degrees
of
military
efficiency
are
obtained
but
generally
experience
shows
that
the
more
thorough
and
intelligent
this
training
in
arms
the
greater
the
development
of
the
requisite
military
qualities
in
the
units
and
the
more
these
qualities
become
a
second
nature
the
more
complete
will
be
their
warlike
efficiency
when
criticizing
the
different
military
systems
we
must
remember
that
with
growing
civilization
the
requisite
military
capacities
are
always
changing
the
duties
expected
from
the
roman
legionary
or
the
soldiers
who
fought
in
line
under
frederick
the
great
were
quite
different
from
those
of
the
rifleman
and
cavalryman
of
not
merely
have
the
physical
functions
of
military
service
altered
but
the
moral
qualities
expected
from
the
fighting
man
are
altered
this
applies
to
the
individual
soldier
as
much
as
to
the
whole
army
the
character
of
warfare
has
continually
been
changing
to
fight
in
the
middle
ages
or
in
the
eighteenth
century
with
comparatively
small
forces
was
one
thing
it
is
quite
another
to
handle
the
colossal
armies
of
the
preparations
for
war
therefore
in
the
social
as
well
as
military
sense
must
be
quite
different
in
a
highly
developed
modern
civilized
state
from
those
in
countries
standing
on
a
lower
level
of
civilization
where
ordinary
life
is
full
of
military
elements
and
war
is
fought
under
relatively
simple
conditions
the
crushing
superiority
of
civilized
states
over
people
with
a
less
developed
civilization
and
military
system
is
due
to
this
altered
form
of
military
efficiency
it
was
thus
that
japan
succeeded
in
raising
herself
in
a
brief
space
to
the
supremacy
in
eastern
asia
she
now
reaps
in
the
advancement
of
her
culture
what
she
sowed
on
the
battlefield
and
proves
once
again
the
immeasurable
importance
in
its
social
and
educational
aspects
of
military
efficiency
our
own
country
by
employing
its
military
powers
has
attained
a
degree
of
culture
which
it
never
could
have
reached
by
the
methods
of
peaceful
development
when
we
regard
the
change
in
the
nature
of
military
efficiency
we
find
ourselves
on
ground
where
the
social
duty
of
maintaining
the
physical
and
moral
power
of
the
nation
to
defend
itself
comes
into
direct
contact
with
the
political
duty
of
preparing
for
warfare
itself
a
great
variety
of
procedure
is
possible
and
actually
exists
in
regard
to
the
immediate
preparations
for
war
this
is
primarily
expressed
in
the
choice
of
the
military
system
but
it
is
manifested
in
various
other
ways
we
see
the
individual
states
according
to
their
geographical
position
their
relations
to
other
states
and
the
military
strength
of
their
neighbours
according
to
their
historic
claims
and
their
greater
or
less
importance
in
the
political
system
of
the
world
making
their
military
preparations
with
more
or
less
energy
earnestness
and
expenditure
when
we
consider
the
complex
movements
of
the
life
of
civilized
nations
the
variety
of
its
aims
and
the
multiplicity
of
its
emotions
we
must
agree
that
the
growth
or
decrease
of
armaments
is
everywhere
affected
by
these
considerations
war
is
only
a
of
attaining
political
ends
and
of
supporting
moral
strength
thus
if
england
attaches
most
weight
to
her
navy
her
insular
position
and
the
wide
oversea
interests
which
she
must
protect
thoroughly
justify
her
policy
if
on
the
other
hand
england
develops
her
land
forces
only
with
the
objects
of
safeguarding
the
command
of
her
colonies
repelling
a
very
improbable
hostile
invasion
and
helping
an
allied
power
in
a
continental
war
the
general
political
situation
explains
the
reason
as
a
matter
of
fact
england
can
never
be
involved
in
a
great
continental
european
war
against
her
will
so
switzerland
which
has
been
declared
neutral
by
political
treaties
and
can
therefore
only
take
the
field
if
she
is
attacked
rightly
lays
most
stress
on
the
social
importance
of
military
service
and
tries
to
develop
a
scheme
of
defence
which
consists
mainly
in
increasing
the
security
afforded
by
her
own
mountains
the
united
states
of
america
again
are
justified
in
keeping
their
land
forces
within
very
modest
limits
while
devoting
their
energies
to
the
increase
of
their
naval
power
no
enemy
equal
to
them
in
strength
can
ever
spring
up
on
the
continent
of
america
they
need
not
fear
the
invasion
of
any
considerable
forces
on
the
other
hand
they
are
threatened
by
oversea
conflicts
of
importance
with
the
yellow
race
which
has
acquired
formidable
strength
opposite
their
western
coast
and
possibly
with
their
great
trade
rival
england
which
has
indeed
often
made
concessions
but
may
eventually
see
herself
compelled
to
fight
for
her
position
in
the
world
while
in
some
states
a
restriction
of
armaments
is
natural
and
justifiable
it
is
easily
understood
that
france
must
strain
every
nerve
to
secure
her
full
recognition
among
the
great
military
nations
of
europe
her
glorious
past
history
has
fostered
in
her
great
political
pretensions
which
she
will
not
abandon
without
a
struggle
although
they
are
no
longer
justified
by
the
size
of
her
population
and
her
international
importance
france
affords
a
conspicuous
example
of
to
ideals
and
of
a
noble
conception
of
political
and
moral
duties
in
the
other
european
states
as
in
france
external
political
conditions
and
claims
in
combination
with
internal
politics
regulate
the
method
and
extent
of
warlike
preparations
and
their
attitude
which
necessity
forces
upon
them
must
be
admitted
to
carry
its
own
justification
a
state
may
represent
a
compact
unity
from
the
point
of
view
of
nationality
and
civilization
it
may
have
great
duties
to
discharge
in
the
development
of
human
culture
and
may
possess
the
national
strength
to
safeguard
its
independence
to
protect
its
own
interests
and
under
certain
circumstances
to
persist
in
its
civilizing
mission
and
political
schemes
in
defiance
of
other
nations
another
state
may
be
deficient
in
the
conditions
of
individual
national
life
and
in
elements
of
culture
it
may
lack
the
resources
necessary
for
the
defence
and
maintenance
of
its
political
existence
in
the
teeth
of
all
opposition
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
these
two
cases
a
state
like
the
latter
is
always
more
or
less
dependent
on
the
friendliness
of
stronger
neighbours
whether
it
ranks
in
public
law
as
fully
independent
or
has
been
proclaimed
neutral
by
international
conventions
if
it
is
attacked
on
one
side
it
must
count
on
support
from
the
other
whether
it
shall
continue
to
exist
as
a
state
and
under
what
conditions
must
depend
on
the
result
of
the
ensuing
war
and
the
consequent
political
position
factors
that
lie
wholly
outside
its
own
sphere
of
power
this
being
the
case
the
question
may
well
be
put
whether
such
a
state
is
politically
justified
in
requiring
from
its
citizens
in
time
of
peace
the
greatest
military
efforts
and
correspondingly
large
pecuniary
expenditure
it
will
certainly
have
to
share
the
contest
in
which
it
is
itself
perhaps
the
prize
and
theoretically
will
do
best
to
have
the
largest
possible
military
force
at
its
disposal
but
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
question
which
is
at
least
arguable
the
fighting
power
of
such
a
state
may
be
so
small
that
it
counts
for
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
millions
of
a
modern
army
on
the
other
hand
where
appreciable
military
strength
exists
it
may
be
best
not
to
organize
the
army
with
a
view
to
decisive
campaigning
but
to
put
the
social
objects
of
military
preparation
into
the
foreground
and
to
adopt
in
actual
warfare
a
defensive
policy
calculated
to
gain
time
with
a
view
to
the
subsequent
interference
of
the
prospective
allies
with
whom
the
ultimate
decision
will
rest
such
an
army
must
if
it
is
to
attain
its
object
represent
a
real
factor
of
strength
it
must
give
the
probable
allies
that
effective
addition
of
strength
which
may
insure
a
superiority
over
the
antagonist
the
ally
must
then
be
forced
to
consider
the
interests
of
such
secondary
state
the
forces
of
the
possible
allies
will
thus
exercise
a
certain
influence
on
the
armament
of
the
state
in
combination
with
the
local
conditions
the
geographical
position
and
the
natural
configuration
of
the
country
it
is
only
to
be
expected
that
since
such
various
conditions
exist
the
utmost
variety
should
also
prevail
among
the
military
systems
and
such
is
in
fact
the
case
in
the
mountain
stronghold
of
switzerland
which
has
to
reckon
with
the
political
and
military
circumstances
of
germany
france
and
italy
preparations
for
war
take
a
different
shape
from
those
of
holland
situated
on
the
coast
and
secured
by
numerous
waterways
whose
political
independence
is
chiefly
affected
by
the
land
forces
of
germany
and
the
navy
of
england
the
conditions
are
quite
otherwise
for
a
country
which
relies
wholly
on
its
own
power
the
power
of
the
probable
antagonists
and
of
the
presumable
allies
will
have
a
certain
importance
for
it
and
its
government
will
in
its
plans
and
military
preparations
pay
attention
to
their
grouping
and
attitudes
but
these
preparations
must
never
be
motived
by
such
considerations
alone
the
necessity
for
a
strong
military
force
is
permanent
and
unqualified
the
political
permutations
and
combinations
are
endless
and
the
assistance
of
possible
allies
is
always
an
uncertain
and
shifting
factor
on
which
no
reliance
can
be
reposed
the
military
power
of
an
independent
state
in
the
true
sense
must
guarantee
the
maintenance
of
a
force
sufficient
to
protect
the
interests
of
a
great
civilized
nation
and
to
secure
to
it
the
necessary
freedom
of
development
if
from
the
social
standpoint
no
sacrifice
can
be
considered
too
great
which
promotes
the
maintenance
of
national
military
efficiency
the
increase
in
these
sacrifices
due
to
political
conditions
must
be
willingly
and
cheerfully
borne
in
consideration
of
the
object
thereby
to
be
gained
this
object
of
which
each
individual
must
be
conscious
if
conceived
in
the
true
spirit
of
statesmanship
comprises
the
conditions
which
are
decisive
for
the
political
and
moral
future
of
the
state
as
well
as
for
the
livelihood
of
each
individual
citizen
a
civilization
which
has
a
value
of
its
own
and
thus
forms
a
vital
factor
in
the
development
of
mankind
can
only
flourish
where
all
the
healthy
and
stimulating
capacities
of
a
nation
find
ample
scope
in
international
competition
this
is
also
an
essential
condition
for
the
unhindered
and
vigorous
exercise
of
individual
activities
where
the
natural
capacity
for
growth
is
permanently
checked
by
external
circumstances
nation
and
state
are
stunted
and
individual
growth
is
set
back
increasing
political
power
and
the
consequent
multiplication
of
possibilities
of
action
constitute
the
only
healthy
soil
for
the
intellectual
and
moral
strength
of
a
vigorous
nation
as
is
shown
by
every
phase
of
history
the
wish
for
culture
must
therefore
in
a
healthy
nation
express
itself
first
in
terms
of
the
wish
for
political
power
and
the
foremost
duty
of
statesmanship
is
to
attain
safeguard
and
promote
this
power
by
force
of
arms
in
the
last
resort
thus
the
first
and
most
essential
duty
of
every
great
civilized
people
is
to
prepare
for
war
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
its
political
needs
even
the
superiority
of
the
enemy
can
not
absolve
from
the
performance
of
this
requirement
on
the
contrary
it
must
stimulate
to
the
utmost
military
efforts
and
the
most
strenuous
political
action
in
order
to
secure
favourable
conditions
for
the
eventuality
of
a
decisive
campaign
mere
numbers
count
for
less
than
ever
in
modern
fighting
although
they
always
constitute
a
very
important
factor
of
the
total
strength
but
within
certain
limits
which
are
laid
down
by
the
law
of
numbers
the
true
elements
of
superiority
under
the
present
system
of
gigantic
armies
are
seen
to
be
spiritual
and
moral
strength
and
larger
masses
will
be
beaten
by
a
small
and
army
the
war
has
proved
this
once
more
granted
that
the
development
of
military
strength
is
the
first
duty
of
every
state
since
all
else
depends
upon
the
possibility
to
assert
it
does
not
follow
that
the
state
must
spend
the
total
of
its
personal
and
financial
resources
solely
on
military
strength
in
the
narrower
sense
of
army
and
navy
that
is
neither
feasible
nor
profitable
the
military
power
of
a
people
is
not
exclusively
determined
by
these
external
resources
it
consists
rather
in
a
harmonious
development
of
physical
spiritual
moral
financial
and
military
elements
of
strength
the
highest
and
most
effective
military
system
can
not
be
developed
except
by
the
of
all
these
factors
it
needs
a
broad
and
basis
in
order
to
be
effective
in
the
manchurian
war
at
the
critical
moment
when
the
japanese
attacking
strength
seemed
spent
the
russian
military
system
broke
down
because
its
foundation
was
unstable
the
state
had
fallen
into
political
and
moral
ruin
and
the
very
army
was
tainted
with
revolutionary
ideas
the
social
requirement
of
maintaining
military
efficiency
and
the
political
necessity
for
so
doing
determine
the
nature
and
degree
of
warlike
preparations
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
this
standard
may
be
very
variously
estimated
according
to
the
notion
of
what
the
duties
are
thus
in
germany
the
most
violent
disputes
burst
out
whenever
the
question
of
the
organization
of
the
military
forces
is
brought
up
since
widely
different
opinions
prevail
about
the
duties
of
the
state
and
of
the
army
it
is
indeed
impossible
so
to
formulate
and
fix
the
political
duties
of
the
state
that
they
can
not
be
looked
at
from
another
standpoint
the
social
democrat
to
whom
agitation
is
an
end
in
itself
will
see
the
duty
of
the
state
in
a
quite
different
light
from
the
political
who
lives
from
hand
to
mouth
without
making
the
bearing
of
things
clear
to
himself
or
from
the
sober
statesman
who
looks
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
keeps
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
distant
beacons
on
the
horizon
of
the
future
certain
points
of
view
however
may
be
laid
down
which
based
on
the
nature
of
things
check
to
some
degree
any
arbitrary
decision
on
these
momentous
questions
and
are
well
adapted
to
persuade
calm
and
experienced
thinkers
first
it
must
be
observed
that
military
power
can
not
be
improvised
in
the
present
political
world
even
though
all
the
elements
for
it
are
present
although
the
german
empire
contains
inhabitants
compared
to
of
french
this
excess
in
population
represents
merely
so
much
dead
capital
unless
a
corresponding
majority
of
recruits
are
annually
enlisted
and
unless
in
the
necessary
machinery
is
set
up
for
their
organization
the
assumption
that
these
masses
would
be
available
for
the
army
in
the
moment
of
need
is
a
delusion
it
would
not
mean
a
strengthening
but
a
distinct
weakening
of
the
army
not
to
say
a
danger
if
these
untrained
masses
were
at
a
crisis
suddenly
sent
on
active
service
bourbaki
campaign
shows
what
is
to
be
expected
from
such
measures
owing
to
the
complexity
of
all
modern
affairs
the
continuous
advance
in
technical
skill
and
in
the
character
of
warlike
weapons
as
also
in
the
increased
requirements
expected
from
the
individual
long
and
minute
preparations
are
necessary
to
procure
the
highest
military
values
allusion
has
already
been
made
to
this
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
it
takes
a
year
to
complete
a
cannon
if
it
is
to
be
ready
for
use
at
a
given
time
it
must
have
been
ordered
long
beforehand
years
will
pass
before
the
full
effect
of
the
strengthening
of
the
army
which
is
now
being
decided
on
appears
in
the
rolls
of
the
reserve
and
the
landwehr
the
recruit
who
begins
his
service
requires
a
year
training
to
become
a
useful
soldier
with
the
hasty
training
of
substitute
reservists
and
such
expedients
we
merely
deceive
ourselves
as
to
the
necessity
of
serious
preparations
we
must
not
regard
the
present
only
but
provide
for
the
future
the
same
argument
applies
to
the
political
conditions
the
man
who
makes
the
bulk
of
the
preparations
for
war
dependent
on
the
shifting
changes
of
the
politics
of
the
day
who
wishes
to
slacken
off
in
the
work
of
arming
because
no
clouds
in
the
political
horizon
suggest
the
necessity
of
greater
efforts
acts
contrary
to
all
real
statesmanship
and
is
sinning
against
his
country
the
moment
does
not
decide
the
great
political
aspirations
oppositions
and
tensions
which
are
based
on
the
nature
of
things
these
turn
the
scale
when
king
william
at
the
beginning
of
the
sixties
of
the
last
century
undertook
the
reorganization
of
the
prussian
army
no
political
tension
existed
the
crisis
of
had
just
subsided
but
the
king
had
perceived
that
the
prussian
armament
was
insufficient
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
future
after
a
bitter
struggle
he
extorted
from
his
people
a
reorganization
of
the
army
and
this
laid
the
foundations
without
which
the
glorious
progress
of
our
state
would
never
have
begun
in
the
same
true
spirit
of
statesmanship
the
emperor
william
ii
has
powerfully
aided
and
extended
the
evolution
of
our
fleet
without
being
under
the
stress
of
any
political
necessity
he
has
enjoyed
the
cheerful
of
his
people
since
the
reform
at
which
he
aimed
was
universally
recognized
as
an
indisputable
need
of
the
future
and
accorded
with
traditional
german
sentiment
while
the
preparation
for
war
must
be
completed
irrespectively
of
the
political
influences
of
the
day
the
military
power
of
the
probable
opponents
marks
a
limit
below
which
the
state
can
not
sink
without
jeopardizing
the
national
safety
further
the
state
is
bound
to
enlist
in
its
service
all
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
so
far
as
they
can
be
applied
to
warfare
since
all
these
methods
and
engines
of
war
should
they
be
exclusively
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
would
secure
him
a
distinct
superiority
it
is
an
obvious
necessity
to
keep
the
forces
which
can
be
put
into
the
field
as
as
possible
and
to
facilitate
their
military
operations
by
every
means
which
science
and
mechanical
skill
supply
further
the
army
must
be
large
enough
to
constitute
a
school
for
the
whole
nation
in
which
a
thoroughgoing
and
no
mere
superficial
military
efficiency
may
be
attained
finally
the
nature
of
the
preparation
for
war
is
to
some
degree
regulated
by
the
political
position
of
the
state
if
the
state
has
satisfied
its
political
ambitions
and
is
chiefly
concerned
with
keeping
its
place
the
military
policy
will
assume
a
more
or
less
defensive
character
states
on
the
other
hand
which
are
still
desirous
of
expansion
or
such
as
are
exposed
to
attacks
on
different
sides
must
adopt
a
predominantly
offensive
military
system
preparations
for
war
in
this
way
follow
definite
lines
which
are
dictated
by
necessity
and
circumstances
but
it
is
evident
that
a
wide
scope
is
still
left
for
varieties
of
personal
opinion
especially
where
the
discussion
includes
the
positive
duties
of
the
state
which
may
lead
to
an
energetic
foreign
policy
and
thus
possibly
to
an
offensive
war
and
where
very
divergent
views
exist
as
to
the
preparation
for
war
in
this
case
the
statesman
only
resource
is
to
use
persuasion
and
to
so
clearly
expound
and
support
his
conceptions
of
the
necessary
policy
that
the
majority
of
the
nation
accept
his
view
there
are
always
and
everywhere
conditions
which
have
a
persuasive
character
of
their
own
and
appeal
to
the
intellects
and
the
feelings
of
the
masses
every
englishman
is
convinced
of
the
necessity
to
maintain
the
command
of
the
sea
since
he
realizes
that
not
only
the
present
powerful
position
of
the
country
but
also
the
possibility
of
feeding
the
population
in
case
of
war
depend
on
it
no
sacrifice
for
the
fleet
is
too
great
and
every
increase
of
foreign
navies
instantly
disquiets
public
opinion
the
whole
of
france
except
a
few
circles
feels
the
necessity
of
strengthening
the
position
of
the
state
which
was
shaken
by
the
defeats
of
through
redoubled
exertions
in
the
military
sphere
and
this
object
is
being
pursued
with
exemplary
unanimity
even
in
neutral
switzerland
the
feeling
that
political
independence
rests
less
on
international
treaties
than
on
the
possibility
of
is
so
strong
and
widespread
that
the
nation
willingly
supports
heavy
taxation
for
its
military
equipment
in
germany
also
it
should
be
possible
to
arouse
a
universal
appreciation
of
the
great
duties
of
the
state
if
only
our
politicians
without
any
diplomatic
evasion
which
deceives
no
one
abroad
and
is
harmful
to
the
people
at
home
disclosed
the
true
political
situation
and
the
necessary
objects
of
our
policy
to
be
sure
they
must
be
ready
to
face
a
struggle
with
public
opinion
as
king
william
did
for
when
public
opinion
does
not
stand
under
the
control
of
a
master
will
or
a
compelling
necessity
it
can
be
led
astray
too
easily
by
the
most
varied
influences
this
danger
is
particularly
great
in
a
country
so
torn
asunder
internally
and
externally
as
germany
he
who
in
such
a
case
listens
to
public
opinion
runs
a
danger
of
inflicting
immense
harm
on
the
interests
of
state
and
people
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
true
statesmanship
is
that
permanent
interests
should
never
be
abandoned
or
prejudiced
for
the
sake
of
momentary
advantages
such
as
the
lightening
of
the
burdens
of
the
taxpayer
the
temporary
maintenance
of
peace
or
suchlike
specious
benefits
which
in
the
course
of
events
often
prove
distinct
disadvantages
the
statesman
therefore
led
astray
neither
by
popular
opinion
nor
by
the
material
difficulties
which
have
to
be
surmounted
nor
by
the
sacrifices
required
of
his
countrymen
must
keep
these
objects
carefully
in
view
so
long
as
it
seems
practicable
he
will
try
to
reconcile
the
conflicting
interests
and
bring
them
into
harmony
with
his
own
but
where
great
fundamental
questions
await
decision
such
as
the
actual
enforcement
of
universal
service
or
of
the
requirements
on
which
readiness
for
war
depends
he
must
not
shrink
from
strong
measures
in
order
to
create
the
forces
which
the
state
needs
or
will
need
in
order
to
maintain
its
vitality
one
of
the
most
essential
political
duties
is
to
initiate
and
sanction
preparations
for
war
on
a
scale
commensurate
with
the
existing
conditions
to
organize
them
efficiently
is
the
duty
of
the
military
authorities
a
duty
which
belongs
in
a
sense
to
the
sphere
of
strategy
since
it
supplies
the
machinery
with
which
commanders
have
to
reckon
policy
and
strategy
touch
in
this
sphere
policy
has
a
strategic
duty
to
perform
since
it
sanctions
preparations
for
war
and
defines
their
limit
it
would
therefore
be
a
fatal
and
foolish
act
of
political
weakness
to
disregard
the
military
and
strategic
standpoint
and
to
make
the
bulk
of
the
preparations
for
war
dependent
on
the
financial
moans
momentarily
available
no
expenditure
without
security
runs
the
formula
in
which
this
policy
clothes
itself
it
is
justified
only
when
the
security
is
fixed
by
the
expenditure
in
a
great
civilized
state
it
is
the
duties
which
must
be
fulfilled
as
treitschke
our
great
historian
and
national
politician
tells
us
that
determine
the
expenditure
and
the
great
finance
minister
is
not
the
man
who
balances
the
national
accounts
by
sparing
the
national
forces
while
renouncing
the
politically
indispensable
outlay
but
he
who
stimulates
all
the
live
forces
of
the
nation
to
cheerful
activity
and
so
employs
them
for
national
ends
that
the
state
revenue
suffices
to
meet
the
admitted
political
demands
he
can
only
attain
this
purpose
if
he
works
in
harmony
with
the
ministers
for
commerce
agriculture
industries
and
colonies
in
order
to
break
down
the
restrictions
which
cramp
the
enterprise
and
energy
of
the
individual
to
make
all
dead
values
remunerative
and
to
create
favourable
conditions
for
profitable
business
a
great
impulse
must
thrill
the
whole
productive
and
financial
circles
of
the
state
if
the
duties
of
the
present
and
the
future
are
to
be
fulfilled
thus
the
preparation
for
war
which
under
modern
conditions
calls
for
very
considerable
expenditure
exercises
a
marked
influence
on
the
entire
social
and
political
life
of
the
people
and
on
the
financial
policy
of
the
state
chapter
vii
the
character
of
our
next
war
the
social
necessity
of
maintaining
the
power
of
the
nation
to
defend
itself
the
political
claims
which
the
state
puts
forward
the
strength
of
the
probable
hostile
combinations
are
the
chief
factors
which
determine
the
conditions
of
preparation
for
war
i
have
already
tried
to
explain
and
formulate
the
duties
in
the
spheres
of
policy
and
progress
which
our
history
and
our
national
character
impose
on
us
my
next
task
is
to
observe
the
possible
military
combinations
which
we
must
be
prepared
to
face
in
this
way
only
can
we
estimate
the
dangers
which
threaten
us
and
can
judge
whether
and
to
what
degree
we
can
carry
out
our
political
intentions
a
thorough
understanding
of
these
hostile
will
give
us
a
clear
insight
into
the
character
of
the
next
war
and
this
war
will
decide
our
future
it
is
not
sufficient
to
know
the
military
fighting
forces
of
our
probable
antagonists
although
this
knowledge
constitutes
the
necessary
basis
for
further
inquiry
but
we
must
picture
to
ourselves
the
intensity
of
the
hostility
with
which
we
have
to
reckon
and
the
probable
efficiency
of
oar
enemies
the
hostility
which
we
must
anticipate
is
determined
by
the
extent
to
which
mutual
political
schemes
and
ambitions
clash
and
by
the
opposition
in
national
character
our
opinion
as
to
the
military
efficiency
of
our
rivals
must
be
based
on
the
latest
data
available
if
we
begin
by
looking
at
the
forces
of
the
individual
states
and
groups
of
states
which
may
be
hostile
to
us
we
have
the
following
results
according
to
the
recent
communications
of
the
french
finance
minister
klotz
in
a
speech
made
at
the
unveiling
of
a
war
memorial
in
issoudan
the
strength
of
the
french
army
on
a
peace
footing
in
the
year
amounted
in
round
figures
to
men
this
included
the
colonial
corps
stationed
in
france
itself
which
in
case
of
war
belongs
to
the
field
army
in
the
european
theatre
of
war
and
the
service
auxiliaire
that
is
some
who
are
drafted
in
for
service
without
arms
the
entire
war
establishment
according
to
the
information
of
the
same
minister
including
field
army
and
reserves
consists
of
men
available
on
mobilization
a
reduction
from
this
number
must
be
made
in
event
of
mobilization
which
french
sources
put
down
at
per
cent
the
whole
strength
of
the
french
field
army
and
reserves
may
therefore
be
reckoned
at
some
to
this
must
be
added
as
i
rather
from
the
same
source
territorials
with
their
reserve
from
which
a
reduction
of
per
or
roughly
men
must
be
made
if
it
is
assumed
that
in
case
of
war
the
distribution
of
the
arms
will
correspond
to
that
in
peace
the
result
is
on
the
basis
of
the
strength
of
separate
arms
which
the
budget
of
anticipates
that
out
of
the
field
and
reserve
troops
there
must
be
assigned
to
the
infantry
about
to
the
cavalry
about
since
a
considerable
part
of
the
reservists
of
these
arms
are
employed
in
the
transport
service
to
the
artillery
about
to
the
pioneers
to
train
and
administration
services
trains
columns
medical
service
etc
no
further
increase
in
these
figures
is
possible
since
in
france
per
cent
of
all
those
liable
to
serve
have
been
called
up
and
the
is
steadily
sinking
while
in
it
reached
yearly
it
has
sunk
in
to
recourse
already
has
been
had
to
the
expedient
of
requiring
smaller
qualifications
than
before
and
of
filling
the
numerous
subsidiary
posts
clerks
waiters
etc
with
less
efficient
men
in
order
to
relieve
the
troops
themselves
under
these
conditions
it
was
necessary
to
tap
new
sources
and
the
plan
has
been
formed
of
increasing
the
troops
with
algerians
and
tunisians
in
order
to
be
able
to
strengthen
the
european
army
with
them
in
event
of
war
at
the
same
time
negroes
who
are
excellent
and
trustworthy
material
are
to
be
enrolled
in
west
africa
a
limited
conscription
such
as
exists
in
tunis
is
to
be
introduced
into
algeria
the
black
army
is
at
first
to
be
completed
by
volunteers
and
conscription
will
only
be
enforced
at
a
crisis
these
black
troops
are
in
the
first
place
to
garrison
algeria
and
tunis
to
release
the
troops
stationed
there
for
service
in
europe
and
to
protect
the
white
settlers
against
the
natives
since
the
negroes
raised
for
military
service
are
heathen
it
is
thought
that
they
will
be
a
counterpoise
to
the
mohammedan
natives
it
has
been
proved
that
negro
troops
stand
the
climate
of
north
africa
excellently
and
form
very
serviceable
troops
the
two
black
battalions
stationed
in
the
schauja
who
took
part
in
the
march
to
fez
bore
the
climate
well
and
thoroughly
proved
their
value
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
plan
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
with
every
prospect
of
success
it
is
so
far
in
an
early
stage
legislative
proposals
on
the
use
of
the
military
resources
offered
by
the
native
algerians
and
the
west
african
negroes
have
not
yet
been
laid
before
parliament
by
the
government
it
can
not
yet
be
seen
to
what
extent
the
native
and
black
troops
will
be
increased
the
former
minister
of
war
messimy
had
advocated
a
partial
conscription
of
the
native
algerians
an
annual
muster
is
made
of
the
algerian
males
of
eighteen
years
of
age
available
for
military
service
the
commission
appointed
for
the
purpose
reported
in
that
after
the
introduction
of
the
limited
service
in
the
army
and
the
reserve
there
would
be
in
algeria
and
tunisia
combined
some
to
native
soldiers
available
in
they
could
also
be
employed
in
europe
and
are
thus
intended
to
strengthen
the
rhine
army
by
three
strong
army
corps
of
troops
who
in
the
course
of
years
may
probably
be
considerably
increased
by
the
formation
of
reserves
as
regards
the
black
troops
the
matter
is
different
france
in
her
west
african
possessions
combined
has
some
negro
troops
available
as
the
black
population
numbers
to
these
figures
may
be
considerably
raised
since
may
there
has
been
an
experimental
battalion
of
senegalese
in
southern
algeria
and
in
the
draft
war
budget
for
a
proposal
was
made
to
transfer
a
second
battalion
of
senegalese
to
algeria
the
conclusion
is
forced
upon
us
that
the
plan
of
sending
black
troops
in
larger
numbers
to
algeria
will
be
vigorously
prosecuted
there
is
however
no
early
probability
of
masses
of
black
troops
being
transported
to
north
africa
since
there
are
not
at
present
a
sufficient
number
of
trained
men
available
the
senegalese
regiments
and
stationed
in
senegambia
are
hardly
enough
to
replace
and
complete
the
senegalese
troops
quartered
in
the
other
african
colonies
of
france
although
there
is
no
doubt
that
france
is
in
a
position
to
raise
a
strong
black
army
the
probability
that
black
divisions
will
be
available
for
a
european
war
is
still
remote
but
it
can
not
be
questioned
that
they
will
be
so
some
day
still
less
is
any
immediate
employment
of
native
moroccan
troops
in
europe
contemplated
morocco
possesses
very
good
native
warriors
but
the
sultan
exerts
effective
sovereignty
only
over
a
part
of
the
territory
termed
morocco
there
can
not
be
therefore
for
years
to
come
any
question
of
employing
this
fighting
material
on
a
large
scale
the
french
and
moroccan
governments
are
for
the
moment
occupied
in
organizing
a
serviceable
sultan
army
of
men
to
secure
the
command
of
the
country
and
to
release
the
french
troops
in
morocco
the
annexation
of
morocco
may
for
the
time
being
mean
no
great
addition
to
military
strength
but
as
order
is
gradually
established
the
country
will
prove
to
be
an
excellent
recruiting
depot
and
france
will
certainly
use
this
source
of
power
with
all
her
accustomed
energy
in
military
matters
for
the
immediate
future
we
have
therefore
only
to
reckon
with
the
reinforcements
of
the
french
european
army
which
can
be
obtained
from
algeria
and
tunisia
so
soon
as
the
limited
system
of
conscription
is
universally
adopted
there
this
will
supply
a
minimum
of
men
and
the
tactical
value
of
these
troops
is
known
to
any
who
have
witnessed
their
exploits
on
the
battlefields
of
weissenburg
and
wörth
at
least
one
strong
division
of
turcos
is
already
available
next
to
the
french
army
we
are
chiefly
concerned
with
the
military
power
of
russia
since
the
peace
and
war
establishments
are
not
published
it
is
hard
to
obtain
accurate
statistics
no
information
is
forthcoming
as
to
the
strength
of
the
various
branches
of
the
service
but
the
totals
of
the
army
may
be
calculated
approximately
according
to
the
recruiting
records
of
the
last
three
years
the
strength
of
the
russian
army
on
a
peace
footing
amounts
to
men
inclusive
of
cossacks
and
frontier
guards
infantry
and
are
formed
into
army
corps
guards
grenadiers
and
army
corps
in
europe
caucasian
turkistanian
and
siberian
corps
the
cavalry
is
divided
into
divisions
independent
brigades
and
separate
independent
regiments
in
war
each
army
corps
consists
of
divisions
and
is
in
round
figures
strong
each
infantry
division
contains
brigades
at
a
strength
of
each
brigade
is
about
strong
the
cavalry
divisions
about
strong
on
the
basis
of
these
numbers
we
arrive
at
a
grand
total
of
for
all
the
army
corps
divisions
brigades
and
cavalry
divisions
to
this
must
be
added
unattached
troops
and
troops
on
frontier
or
garrison
duty
so
that
the
war
strength
of
the
standing
army
can
be
reckoned
at
some
this
grand
total
is
not
all
available
in
a
european
theatre
of
war
the
siberian
and
turkistanian
army
corps
must
be
deducted
as
they
would
certainly
be
left
in
the
interior
and
on
the
eastern
frontier
for
the
maintenance
of
order
in
the
interior
it
would
probably
be
necessary
to
leave
the
troops
in
finland
the
guards
at
petersburg
at
least
one
division
at
moscow
and
the
caucasian
army
corps
in
the
caucasus
this
would
mean
a
deduction
of
thirteen
army
corps
or
men
so
that
we
have
to
reckon
with
a
field
army
made
up
of
the
standing
army
men
strong
to
this
must
be
added
about
regiments
of
cossacks
of
the
second
and
third
ban
which
may
be
placed
at
men
and
the
reserve
and
formations
to
be
set
on
foot
in
case
of
war
for
the
formation
of
reserves
there
are
sufficient
trained
men
available
to
constitute
a
reserve
division
of
the
first
and
second
rank
for
each
corps
respectively
these
troops
if
each
division
is
assumed
to
contain
men
would
be
men
strong
of
course
a
certain
reduction
must
be
made
in
these
figures
also
it
is
not
known
which
of
these
formations
would
be
really
raised
in
event
of
mobilization
in
any
case
there
will
be
an
enormous
army
ready
to
be
put
into
movement
for
a
great
war
after
deducting
all
the
forces
which
must
be
left
behind
in
the
interior
a
field
army
of
men
could
easily
be
organized
in
europe
it
can
not
be
stated
for
certain
whether
arms
equipment
and
ammunition
for
such
a
host
can
be
supplied
in
sufficient
quantity
but
it
will
be
best
not
to
undervalue
an
empire
like
russia
in
this
respect
quite
another
picture
is
presented
to
us
when
we
turn
our
attention
to
england
the
third
member
of
the
triple
entente
the
british
empire
is
divided
from
the
military
point
of
view
into
two
divisions
into
the
united
kingdom
itself
with
the
colonies
governed
by
the
english
cabinet
and
the
colonies
these
latter
have
at
their
disposal
a
militia
which
is
sometimes
only
in
process
of
formation
they
can
be
completely
ignored
so
far
as
concerns
any
european
theatre
of
war
the
army
of
the
parts
of
the
empire
administered
by
the
english
cabinet
divides
into
the
regular
army
which
is
filled
up
by
enlistment
the
native
troops
commanded
by
english
officers
and
the
territorial
army
a
militia
made
up
of
volunteers
which
has
not
reached
the
intended
total
of
it
is
now
strong
and
is
destined
exclusively
for
home
defence
its
military
value
can
not
at
present
be
ranked
very
highly
for
a
continental
european
war
it
may
be
left
out
of
account
we
have
in
that
case
only
to
deal
with
a
part
of
the
regular
english
army
this
is
some
strong
the
men
serve
twelve
years
of
which
seven
are
with
the
colours
and
five
in
the
reserve
the
annual
supply
of
recruits
is
the
regular
reserve
is
now
strong
there
is
also
a
special
reserve
with
a
training
which
is
enlisted
for
special
purposes
so
that
the
grand
total
of
the
reserve
reaches
the
figure
of
of
the
regular
english
army
men
are
stationed
in
england
in
india
where
in
combination
with
native
troops
they
form
the
army
and
about
in
different
stations
gibraltar
malta
egypt
aden
south
africa
and
the
other
colonies
and
protectorates
in
this
connection
the
conditions
in
egypt
are
the
most
interesting
english
are
stationed
there
while
in
the
native
egyptian
army
strong
in
strong
of
the
officers
are
englishmen
it
may
be
supposed
that
in
view
of
the
great
excitement
in
the
moslem
world
the
position
of
the
english
is
precarious
the
troops
now
stationed
in
south
africa
are
to
be
transferred
as
soon
as
possible
to
mediterranean
garrisons
in
event
of
war
a
special
division
will
on
emergency
be
organized
there
for
a
war
in
continental
europe
we
have
only
to
take
into
account
the
regular
army
stationed
in
england
when
mobilized
it
forms
the
regular
field
army
of
infantry
divisions
cavalry
division
mounted
brigades
and
army
troops
and
numbers
men
without
columns
and
trains
the
regular
troops
in
the
united
kingdom
which
do
not
form
part
of
the
regular
field
army
are
some
strong
they
consist
of
a
very
small
number
of
mobile
units
foot
artillery
and
engineers
for
coast
defence
as
well
as
the
reserve
formations
these
troops
with
some
militia
artillery
and
militia
engineers
constitute
the
home
army
under
whose
protection
the
territorial
field
army
is
completing
its
organization
months
must
certainly
elapse
before
portions
of
this
army
can
strengthen
the
regular
field
army
at
the
most
men
may
be
reckoned
upon
for
an
english
expeditionary
force
these
troops
compose
at
the
same
time
the
reserve
of
the
troops
stationed
in
the
colonies
which
require
reinforcements
at
grave
crises
this
constitutes
the
weak
point
in
the
british
armament
england
can
employ
her
regular
army
in
a
continental
war
so
long
only
as
all
is
quiet
in
the
colonies
this
fact
brings
into
prominence
how
important
it
will
be
should
war
break
out
to
threaten
england
in
her
colonial
possessions
and
especially
in
egypt
against
the
powerful
hosts
which
the
powers
of
the
triple
entente
can
put
into
the
field
germany
can
command
an
active
army
of
men
on
peace
establishment
including
officers
and
about
officers
while
austria
has
an
army
which
on
a
peace
footing
is
men
and
about
officers
strong
the
combined
war
strength
of
the
two
states
may
be
estimated
as

it
can
accordingly
be
roughly
calculated
what
field
army

the
entire

certainly
comes
under
this
head
in
greece
which
does
not
signify
much
for
a
european
war
but
might
in
combination
with
the
small
balkan
states
prove
very
troublesome
to
turkey
and
is
therefore
important
for
us
an
active

the
mobilization
is
so
badly
organized
that
at
the
end
of
a
month
to
men
could
at
most
be
put
into
the
field
as
regards
the
naval
forces
of
the
states
which
concern
us
the
accompanying
table
which
is
taken
from
the
of
affords
a
comparative
epitome
which
applies
to
may
it
shows
that
numerically
the
english
fleet
is
more
than
double
as
strong
as
ours
this
superiority
is
increased
if
the
displacements
and
the
number
of
really
modern
ships
are
compared
in
may
we
possessed
only
four
battleships
and
one
armed
cruiser
of
the
latest
type
the
english
have
ten
and
four
armed
cruisers
which
could
be
reckoned
battleships
the
new
ships
do
not
materially
alter
this
proportion
the
comparative
number
of
the
is
becoming
more
favourable
that
of
the
armoured
cruisers
will
be
less
so
than
it
now
is
it
may
be
noticed
that
among
our
cruisers
are
a
number
of
vessels
which
really
have
no
fighting
value
and
that
the
ironclads
can
not
be
counted
as
battleships
france
too
was
a
little
ahead
of
us
in
the
number
of
battleships
in
may
but
from
all
that
is
hitherto
known
about
the
french
fleet
it
can
not
be
compared
with
the
german
in
respect
of
good
material
and
trained
crews
it
would
however
be
an
important
factor
if

or
let

assume
that
in

england
as
well
as
france
must
leave
a
certain
naval
force
in
the
mediterranean
which
need
not
be
stronger
than
the
combined
italian
and
austrian
fleets
but
might
be
smaller
in
event
of
a
change
in
the
grouping
of
the
states
let
us
further
assume
that
numerous
cruisers
will
be
detained
at
the
stations
the
fact
however
remains
that
england
and
france
together
can
collect
against
germany
in
the
north
sea
a
fleet
of
battleships
alone
three
times
as
strong
as
that
of
germany
and
will
be
supported
by
a
vastly
superior
force
of
and
submarines
if
russia
joins
the
alliance
of
these
powers
that
would
signify
another
addition
to
the
forces
of
our
opponents
which
must
not
be
underestimated
since
the
baltic
fleet
in
the
spring
of
contained
two
large
battleships
and
the
baltic
fleet
of
cruisers
is
always
in
a
position
to
threaten
our
coasts
and
to
check
the
free
access
to
the
baltic
in
one
way
or
the
other
we
must
get
even
with
that
fleet
the
auxiliary
cruiser
fleet
of
the
allies
to
which
england
can
send
a
large
contingent
would
also
be
superior
to
us
as
regards
and
training
it
may
be
assumed
that
our
fleet
is
distinctly
superior
to
the
french
and
russian
but
that
england
is
our
equal
in
that
respect
our
ships
cannons
will
probably
show
a
superiority
over
the
english
and
our
torpedo
fleet
by
its
reckless
energy
excellent
training
and
daring
spirit
of
adventure
will
make
up
some
of
the
numerical
disadvantage
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
these
advantages
will
have
much
weight
against
the
overwhelming
superiority
of
an
experienced
and
celebrated
fleet
like
the
english
reflection
shows
that
the
superiority
by
sea
with
which
we
must
under
certain
circumstances
reckon
is
very
great
and
that
our
position
in
this
respect
is
growing
worse
since
the
states
of
the
triple
entente
can
build
and
man
far
more
ships
than
we
can
in
the
same
time
if
we
consider
from
the
political
standpoint
the
probable
attitude
of
the
separate
states
which
may
take
part
in
the
next
war
against
germany
we
may
assume
that
the
intensity
of
the
struggle
will
not
be
the
same
in
every
case
since
the
political
objects
of
our
possible
antagonists
are
very
different
if
we
look
at
france
first
we
are
entitled
to
assume
that
she
is
not
a
match
for
us
but
can
only
be
dangerous
to
us
as
a
member
of
a
coalition
the
tactical
value
of
the
french
troops
is
of
course
very
high
numerically
the
army
of
our
neighbour
on
the
west
is
almost
equal
and
in
some
directions
there
may
be
a
superiority
in
organization
and
equipment
in
other
directions
we
have
a
distinct
advantage
the
french
army
lacks
the
subordination
under
a
single
commander
the
united
spirit
which
characterizes
the
german
army
the
tenacious
strength
of
the
german
race
and
the
de
of
the
officers
france
too
has
not
those
national
reserves
available
which
would
allow
us
almost
to
double
our
forces
these
are
the
conditions
now
existing
but
if
the
french
succeed
in
making
a
large
african
army
available
for
a
european
theatre
the
estimate
of
strength
of
the
french
army
as
compared
with
ours
will
be
quite
different
this
possibility
must
be
borne
in
mind
for
according
to
the
whole
previous
development
of
affairs
we
may
safely
assume
that
france
will
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
acquire
if
only
for
a
time
a
military
superiority
over
germany
she
knows
well
that
she
can
not
reach
her
political
goal
except
by
a
complete
defeat
of
her
eastern
neighbour
and
that
such
a
result
can
only
be
obtained
by
the
exercise
of
extraordinary
efforts
it
is
certain
that
france
will
not
only
try
to
develop
her
own
military
power
with
the
utmost
energy
but
that
she
will
defend
herself
desperately
if
attacked
by
germany
on
the
other
hand
she
will
probably
not
act
on
the
offensive
against
germany
unless
she
has
increased
her
own
efficiency
to
the
utmost
limit
and
believes
that
she
has
secured
the
military
supremacy
by
the
help
of
active
allies
the
stakes
are
too
high
to
play
under
unfavourable
conditions
but
if
france
thinks
she
has
all
the
trumps
in
her
hands
she
will
not
shrink
from
an
offensive
war
and
will
stake
even
thing
in
order
to
strike
us
a
mortal
blow
we
must
expect
the
most
bitter
hostility
from
this
antagonist
should
the
triple
alliance
break
up
as
seems
probable
now
this
hour
will
soon
have
struck
b
if
the
war
then
declared
be
waged
against
us
in
combination
with
england
it
may
be
assumed
that
the
allied
great
powers
would
attempt
to
turn
our
strategical
right
flank
through
belgium
and
holland
and
penetrate
into
the
heart
of
germany
through
the
great
gap
in
the
fortresses
between
wesel
and
flushing
this
operation
would
have
the
considerable
advantage
of
avoiding
the
strong
line
of
the
rhine
and
threatening
our
naval
bases
from
the
land
side
from
the
superiority
of
the
combined
fleet
the
army
of
invasion
could
without
difficulty
have
its
base
on
our
coasts
such
an
operation
would
enormously
facilitate
the
frontal
attack
on
our
west
frontier
and
would
enable
the
french
to
push
a
victorious
advance
onward
to
the
rhine
after
investing
metz
and
diedenhofen
footnote
b
written
in
october
england
with
whose
hostility
as
well
with
that
of
the
french
we
must
reckon
could
only
undertake
a
land
war
against
us
with
the
support
of
an
ally
who
would
lead
the
main
attack
england
troops
would
only
serve
as
reinforcements
they
are
too
weak
for
an
independent
campaign
english
interests
also
lie
in
a
quite
different
field
and
are
not
coincident
with
those
of
france
the
main
issue
for
england
is
to
annihilate
our
navy
and
oversea
commerce
in
order
to
prevent
from
reasons
already
explained
any
further
expansion
of
our
power
but
it
is
not
her
interest
to
destroy
our
position
as
a
continental
power
or
to
help
france
to
attain
the
supremacy
in
europe
english
interests
demand
a
certain
equilibrium
between
the
continental
states
england
only
wishes
to
use
france
in
order
with
her
help
to
attain
her
own
special
ends
but
she
will
never
impose
on
herself
sacrifices
which
are
not
absolutely
necessary
for
the
private
advantage
of
her
ally
these
principles
will
characterize
her
plan
of
campaign
if
she
sees
herself
compelled
by
the
political
position
and
the
interests
of
her
naval
supremacy
to
take
part
in
a
war
against
us
if
england
as
must
be
regarded
probable
determines
sooner
or
later
on
this
step
it
is
clearly
to
her
advantage
to
win
a
rapid
victory
in
the
first
place
her
own
trade
will
not
be
injured
longer
than
necessary
by
the
war
in
the
second
place
the
centrifugal
forces
of
her
loosely
compacted
world
empire
might
be
set
in
movement
and
the
colonies
might
consult
their
own
separate
interests
should
england
have
her
hands
tied
by
a
great
war
it
is
not
unlikely
that
revolutions
might
break
out
in
india
and
egypt
if
england
forces
were
long
occupied
with
a
european
war
again
the
states
not
originally
taking
part
in
the
war
might
interfere
in
our
favour
if
the
decision
were
much
delayed
it
was
important
for
us
in
to
take
paris
quickly
in
order
to
forestall
any
interference
of
neutrals
similar
conditions
might
arise
in
the
case
of
england
we
must
therefore
make
up
our
minds
that
the
attack
by
sea
will
be
made
with
the
greatest
and
most
persistent
vigour
with
the
firm
resolve
to
destroy
completely
our
fleet
and
our
great
commercial
centres
it
is
also
not
only
possible
but
probable
that
england
will
throw
troops
on
the
continent
in
order
to
secure
the
of
her
allies
who
might
demand
this
guarantee
of
the
sincerity
of
english
policy
and
also
to
support
the
naval
attack
on
the
coast
on
the
other
hand
the
land
war
will
display
the
same
kind
of
desperate
energy
only
so
far
as
it
pursues
the
object
of
conquering
and
destroying
our
naval
bases
the
english
would
be
the
less
disposed
to
do
more
than
this
because
the
german
auxiliaries
who
have
so
often
fought
battles
would
not
be
forthcoming
the
greatest
exertions
of
the
nation
will
be
limited
to
the
naval
war
the
land
war
will
be
waged
with
a
definitely
restricted
object
on
which
its
character
will
depend
it
is
very
questionable
whether
the
english
army
is
capable
of
effectively
acting
on
the
offensive
against
continental
european
troops
in
south
africa
the
english
regiments
for
the
most
part
fought
very
bravely
and
stood
great
losses
on
the
other
hand
they
completely
failed
in
the
offensive
in
tactics
as
in
operations
and
with
few
exceptions
the
generalship
was
equally
deficient
the
last
manoeuvres
on
a
large
scale
held
in
ireland
under
the
direction
of
general
french
did
not
according
to
available
information
show
the
english
army
in
a
favourable
light
so
far
as
strategical
ability
went
if
we
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
east
in
order
to
forecast
probable
behaviour
we
must
begin
by
admitting
that
from
a
russian
standpoint
a
war
in
the
west
holds
out
better
prospects
of
success
than
a
renewed
war
with
japan
and
possibly
with
china
the
empire
of
the
czar
finds
in
the
west
powerful
allies
who
are
impatiently
waiting
to
join
in
an
attack
on
germany
the
geographical
conditions
and
means
of
communication
there
allow
a
far
more
rapid
and
systematic
development
of
power
than
in
manchuria
public
opinion
in
which
hatred
of
germany
is
as
persistent
as
ever
would
be
in
favour
of
such
a
war
and
a
victory
over
germany
and
austria
would
not
only
open
the
road
to
constantinople
but
would
greatly
improve
the
political
and
economic
influence
of
russia
in
western
europe
such
a
success
would
afford
a
splendid
compensation
for
the
defeats
in
asia
and
would
offer
advantages
such
as
never
could
be
expected
on
the
eastern
frontiers
of
the
empire
should
russia
then
after
weighing
these
chances
launch
out
into
an
offensive
war
in
the
west
the
struggle
would
probably
assume
a
quite
different
character
from
that
for
example
of
a
war
russia
owing
to
her
vast
extent
is
in
the
first
place
secure
against
complete
subjugation
in
case
of
defeat
her
centre
of
gravity
is
not
shifted
a
russian
war
can
hardly
ever
therefore
become
a
struggle
for
political
existence
and
cause
that
straining
of
every
nerve
which
such
a
struggle
entails
the
inhabitants
will
hardly
ever
show
in
wars
whose
objects
can
not
be
clear
to
them
throughout
the
vast
empire
the
social
and
also
political
education
especially
among
the
peasants
is
so
poor
that
any
grasp
of
the
problems
of
a
foreign
policy
seems
quite
out
of
the
question
the
sections
of
the
people
who
have
acquired
a
little
superficial
learning
in
the
defective
russian
schools
have
sworn
to
the
revolutionary
colours
or
follow
a
blind
policy
which
seems
to
them
best
to
meet
their
interests
the
former
at
least
would
only
make
use
of
a
war
to
promote
their
own
revolutionary
schemes
as
they
did
in
the
crisis
of
the
war
under
the
circumstances
there
can
be
little
idea
of
a
united
outburst
of
the
national
spirit
which
would
enable
an
offensive
war
to
be
carried
on
with
persistent
vigour
there
has
been
an
extraordinary
change
in
the
conditions
since
when
the
people
showed
some
unanimity
in
repelling
the
invasion
should
russia
be
involved
in
a
western
war
with
germany
and
austria
she
could
never
bring
her
whole
forces
into
play
in
the
first
place
the
revolutionary
elements
in
the
heart
of
the
state
would
avail
themselves
of
every
weakening
of
the
national
sources
of
power
to
effect
a
revolution
in
internal
politics
without
any
regard
for
the
interests
of
the
community
secondly
in
the
far
east
japan
or
china
would
seize
the
moment
when
russia
forces
in
the
west
were
fully
occupied
to
carry
out
their
political
intentions
towards
the
empire
of
the
czar
by
force
of
arms
forces
must
always
be
kept
in
reserve
for
this
eventuality
as
we
have
already
mentioned
although
russia
under
the
present
conditions
can
not
bring
her
whole
power
to
bear
against
germany
and
austria
and
must
also
always
leave
a
certain
force
on
her
european
southern
frontier
she
is
less
affected
by
defeats
than
other
states
neither
the
crimean
war
nor
the
greater
exertions
and
sacrifices
exacted
by
her
victory
over
the
turks
nor
the
heavy
defeats
by
the
japanese
have
seriously
shaken
political
prestige
beaten
in
the
east
or
south
she
turns
to
another
sphere
of
enterprise
and
endeavours
to
recoup
herself
there
for
her
losses
on
another
frontier
such
conditions
must
obviously
affect
the
character
of
the
war
russia
will
certainly
put
huge
armies
into
the
field
against
us
in
the
wars
against
turkey
and
japan
the
internal
affairs
of
the
empire
prevented
the
employment
of
its
full
strength
in
the
latter
campaign
revolutionary
agitation
in
the
army
itself
influenced
the
operations
and
battles
and
in
a
european
war
the
same
conditions
would
in
all
probability
make
themselves
emphatically
felt
especially
if
defeats
favoured
or
encouraged
revolutionary
propaganda
in
a
war
against
russia
more
than
in
any
other
war
le
premier
pas
qui
if
the
first
operations
are
unsuccessful
their
effect
on
the
whole
position
will
be
wider
than
in
any
other
war
since
they
will
excite
in
the
country
itself
not
sympathetic
feelings
only
but
also
hostile
forces
which
would
cripple
the
conduct
of
the
war
so
far
as
the
efficiency
of
the
russian
army
goes
the
war
proved
that
the
troops
fight
with
great
stubbornness
the
struggle
showed
numerous
instances
of
heroic
and
the
heaviest
losses
were
often
borne
with
courage
on
the
other
hand
the
russian
army
quite
failed
on
the
offensive
in
a
certain
sense
tactically
but
essentially
owing
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
commanders
and
the
failure
of
the
individuals
the
method
of
conducting
the
war
was
quite
wrong
indecision
and
irresolution
characterized
the
russian
officers
of
every
grade
and
no
personality
came
forward
who
ever
attempted
to
rise
above
mediocrity
it
can
hardly
be
presumed
that
the
spirit
of
russian
generalship
has
completely
changed
since
the
defeats
in
manchuria
and
that
striking
personalities
have
come
on
the
stage
this
army
must
therefore
always
be
met
with
a
bold
policy
of
attack
when
we
contrast
these
conditions
with
the
position
of
germany
we
can
not
blink
the
fact
that
we
have
to
deal
with
immense
military
difficulties
if
we
are
to
attain
our
own
political
ends
or
repel
successfully
the
attack
of
our
opponents
in
the
first
place
the
geographical
configuration
and
position
of
our
country
are
very
unfavourable
our
open
eastern
frontier
offers
no
opportunity
for
continued
defence
and
berlin
the
centre
of
the
government
and
administration
lies
in
dangerous
proximity
to
it
our
western
frontier
in
itself
strong
can
be
easily
turned
on
the
north
through
belgium
and
holland
no
natural
obstacle
no
strong
fortress
is
there
to
oppose
a
hostile
invasion
and
neutrality
is
only
a
paper
bulwark
so
in
the
south
the
barrier
of
the
rhine
can
easily
be
turned
through
switzerland
there
of
course
the
character
of
the
country
offers
considerable
difficulties
and
if
the
swiss
defend
themselves
resolutely
it
might
not
be
easy
to
break
down
their
resistance
their
army
is
no
despicable
factor
of
strength
and
if
they
were
attacked
in
their
mountains
they
would
fight
as
they
did
at
sempach
and
murten
the
natural
approaches
from
the
north
sea
to
the
baltic
the
sound
and
the
great
belt
are
commanded
by
foreign
guns
and
can
easily
fall
a
prey
to
our
enemies
the
narrow
coast
with
which
we
face
to
the
north
sea
forms
in
itself
a
strong
front
but
can
easily
be
taken
in
the
rear
through
holland
england
is
planted
before
our
coasts
in
such
a
manner
that
our
entire
oversea
commerce
can
be
easily
blocked
in
the
south
and
alone
are
we
secured
by
austria
from
direct
invasion
otherwise
we
are
encircled
by
our
enemies
we
may
have
to
face
attacks
on
three
sides
this
circumstance
compels
us
to
fight
on
the
inner
lines
and
so
presents
certain
advantages
but
it
is
also
fraught
with
dangers
if
our
opponents
understand
how
to
act
on
a
correct
and
consistent
plan
if
we
look
at
our
general
political
position
we
can
not
conceal
the
fact
that
we
stand
isolated
and
can
not
expect
support
from
anyone
in
carrying
out
our
positive
political
plans
england
france
and
russia
have
a
common
interest
in
breaking
down
our
power
this
interest
will
sooner
or
later
be
asserted
by
arms
it
is
not
therefore
the
interest
of
any
nation
to
increase
germany
power
if
we
wish
to
attain
an
extension
of
our
power
as
is
natural
in
our
position
we
must
win
it
by
the
sword
against
vastly
superior
foes
our
alliances
are
defensive
not
merely
in
form
but
essentially
so
i
have
already
shown
that
this
is
a
cause
of
their
weakness
neither
austria
nor
italy
are
in
any
way
bound
to
support
by
armed
force
a
german
policy
directed
towards
an
increase
of
power
we
are
not
even
sure
of
their
diplomatic
help
as
the
conduct
of
italy
at
the
conference
of
algeçiras
sufficiently
demonstrated
it
even
seems
questionable
at
the
present
moment
whether
we
can
always
reckon
on
the
support
of
the
members
of
the
triple
alliance
in
a
defensive
war
the
recent
of
italy
with
france
and
england
goes
far
beyond
the
idea
of
an
extra
turn
if
we
consider
how
difficult
italy
would
find
it
to
make
her
forces
fit
to
cope
with
france
and
to
protect
her
coasts
against
hostile
attacks
and
if
we
think
how
the
annexation
of
tripoli
has
created
a
new
possession
which
is
not
easily
defended
against
france
and
england
we
may
fairly
doubt
whether
italy
would
take
part
in
a
war
in
which
england
and
france
were
allied
against
us
austria
is
undoubtedly
a
loyal
ally
her
interests
are
closely
connected
with
our
own
and
her
policy
is
dominated
by
the
same
spirit
of
loyalty
and
integrity
as
ours
towards
austria
nevertheless
there
is
cause
for
anxiety
because
in
a
conglomerate
state
like
austria
which
contains
numerous
slavonic
elements
patriotism
may
not
be
strong
enough
to
allow
the
government
to
fight
to
the
death
with
russia
were
the
latter
to
defeat
us
the
occurrence
of
such
an
event
is
not
improbable
when
enumerating
the
possibilities
that
might
affect
our
policy
we
can
not
leave
this
one
out
of
consideration
we
shall
therefore
some
day
perhaps
be
faced
with
the
necessity
of
standing
isolated
in
a
great
war
of
the
nations
as
once
frederick
the
great
stood
when
he
was
basely
deserted
by
england
in
the
middle
of
the
struggle
and
shall
have
to
trust
to
our
own
strength
and
our
own
resolution
for
victory
such
a
war
for
us
more
than
for
any
other
nation
must
be
a
war
for
our
political
and
national
existence
this
must
be
so
for
our
opponents
can
only
attain
their
political
aims
by
almost
annihilating
us
by
land
and
by
sea
if
the
victory
is
only
half
won
they
would
have
to
expect
continuous
renewals
of
the
contest
which
would
be
contrary
to
their
interests
they
know
that
well
enough
and
therefore
avoid
the
contest
since
we
shall
certainly
defend
ourselves
with
the
utmost
bitterness
and
obstinacy
if
notwithstanding
circumstances
make
the
war
inevitable
then
the
intention
of
our
enemies
to
crush
us
to
the
ground
and
our
own
resolve
to
maintain
our
position
victoriously
will
make
it
a
war
of
desperation
a
war
fought
and
lost
under
such
circumstances
would
destroy
our
laboriously
gained
political
importance
would
jeopardize
the
whole
future
of
our
nation
would
throw
us
back
for
centuries
would
shake
the
influence
of
german
thought
in
the
civilized
world
and
thus
check
the
general
progress
of
mankind
in
its
healthy
development
for
which
a
flourishing
germany
is
the
essential
condition
our
next
war
will
be
fought
for
the
highest
interests
of
our
country
and
of
mankind
this
will
invest
it
with
importance
in
the
world
history
world
power
or
downfall
will
be
our
rallying
cry
keeping
this
idea
before
us
we
must
prepare
for
war
with
the
confident
intention
of
conquering
and
with
the
iron
resolve
to
persevere
to
the
end
come
what
may
we
must
therefore
prepare
not
only
for
a
short
war
but
for
a
protracted
campaign
we
must
be
armed
in
order
to
complete
the
overthrow
of
our
enemies
should
the
victory
be
ours
and
if
worsted
to
continue
to
defend
ourselves
in
the
very
heart
of
our
country
until
success
at
last
is
won
it
is
therefore
by
no
means
enough
to
maintain
a
certain
numerical
equality
with
our
opponents
on
the
contrary
we
must
strive
to
call
up
the
entire
forces
of
the
nation
and
prepare
and
arm
for
the
great
decision
which
impends
we
must
try
also
to
gain
a
certain
superiority
over
our
opponents
in
the
crucial
points
so
that
we
may
hold
some
winning
trumps
in
our
hand
in
a
contest
unequal
from
the
very
first
we
must
bear
these
two
points
in
mind
when
preparing
for
war
only
by
continually
realizing
the
duties
thus
laid
on
us
can
we
carry
out
our
preparations
to
the
fullest
and
satisfy
the
demands
which
the
future
makes
on
us
a
nation
of
which
stakes
her
forces
on
winning
herself
a
position
and
on
keeping
that
position
can
not
be
conquered
but
it
is
an
evil
day
for
her
if
she
relies
on
the
semblance
of
power
or
miscalculating
her
enemies
strength
is
content
with
and
looks
to
luck
or
chance
for
that
which
can
only
be
attained
by
the
exertion
and
development
of
all
her
powers
chapter
viii
the
next
naval
war
in
the
next
european
land
war
we
shall
probably
face
our
foes
with
austria
at
our
side
and
thus
will
be
in
a
position
to
win
the
day
against
any
opposing
forces
in
a
naval
war
we
shall
be
thrown
on
our
own
resources
and
must
protect
ourselves
against
the
superior
forces
which
will
certainly
press
us
hard
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
war
will
be
waged
with
england
for
although
we
can
not
contemplate
attacking
england
as
such
an
attack
would
be
hopeless
that
country
itself
has
a
lively
interest
in
checking
our
political
power
it
will
therefore
under
certain
conditions
attack
in
order
to
annihilate
our
fleet
and
aid
france
the
english
have
besides
taken
good
care
that
the
prospect
of
a
war
with
them
should
always
be
held
before
our
eyes
they
talk
so
much
of
a
possible
german
attack
that
it
can
not
surprise
them
if
the
light
thrown
on
the
question
is
from
the
opposite
point
of
view
again
the
preparations
which
they
are
making
in
the
north
sea
show
clearly
that
they
certainly
have
contemplated
an
attack
on
germany
these
preparations
are
like
a
strategic
march
and
the
natural
extension
of
their
naval
bases
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
their
meaning
the
great
military
harbour
of
rosyth
is
admittedly
built
for
the
eventuality
of
a
war
with
germany
and
can
mean
nothing
else
harwich
has
also
been
recently
made
into
an
especially
strong
naval
base
and
further
the
roadstead
of
scapa
flow
in
the
orkney
isles
has
been
enlarged
into
a
cruiser
station
these
are
measures
so
directly
and
obviously
directed
against
us
that
they
demand
an
inquiry
into
the
military
position
thus
created
the
english
have
only
considered
the
possibility
of
a
german
war
since
before
that
year
there
was
no
idea
of
any
such
contingency
and
it
is
therefore
not
unnatural
that
they
are
eager
to
make
up
for
lost
time
this
fact
does
not
alter
the
hostile
character
of
the
measures
and
the
circumstance
that
the
english
preparations
for
war
are
exclusively
directed
against
germany
we
must
therefore
as
the
general
position
of
the
world
leads
us
to
believe
reckon
on
the
probability
of
a
naval
war
with
england
and
shall
then
have
to
fight
against
an
overwhelming
superiority
it
will
be
so
great
that
we
can
not
hope
for
a
long
time
to
be
able
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
english
fleet
but
we
must
contemplate
the
possibility
of
becoming
its
master
in
one
way
or
another
and
of
winning
the
freedom
of
the
seas
if
england
attacks
us
we
shall
now
discuss
this
possibility
on
this
matter
i
am
expressing
my
personal
views
only
which
are
not
confused
by
any
technical
naval
knowledge
and
rest
exclusively
on
general
military
considerations
in
which
our
presupposed
antagonists
can
and
will
indulge
quite
as
well
as
myself
i
shall
not
betray
any
secrets
of
the
admiralty
since
i
do
not
know
any
but
i
consider
it
expedient
that
the
german
people
should
clearly
understand
what
dangers
threaten
from
england
and
how
they
can
be
met
in
the
view
of
these
dangers
and
the
circumstance
that
we
are
not
strong
enough
to
entertain
any
idea
of
provoking
a
battle
the
question
remains
what
are
the
means
of
defensive
naval
strategy
to
secure
protection
from
a
superior
and
enemy
and
gradually
to
become
its
master
the
plan
might
be
formed
of
anticipating
the
enemy
by
a
sudden
attack
instead
of
waiting
passively
for
him
to
attack
first
and
of
opening
the
war
as
the
japanese
did
before
port
arthur
in
this
way
the
english
fleet
might
be
badly
damaged
at
the
outset
of
the
real
hostilities
its
superiority
might
be
lessened
and
the
beginning
of
the
effective
blockade
delayed
at
least
for
a
short
time
it
is
not
unthinkable
that
such
an
attempt
will
be
made
such
an
undertaking
however
does
not
seem
to
me
to
promise
any
great
success
the
english
have
secured
themselves
against
such
attacks
by
comprehensive
works
of
defence
in
their
exposed
harbours
it
seems
dangerous
to
risk
our
and
submarines
which
we
shall
urgently
need
in
the
later
course
of
the
war
in
such
bold
undertakings
even
the
war
against
the
english
commerce
holds
out
less
prospects
than
formerly
as
soon
as
a
state
of
political
tension
sets
in
the
english
merchantmen
will
be
convoyed
by
their
numerous
cruisers
under
such
circumstances
our
auxiliary
cruisers
could
do
little
while
our
foreign
service
ships
would
soon
have
to
set
about
attacking
the
warships
before
coal
ran
short
for
to
fill
up
the
of
these
ships
will
certainly
be
a
difficult
task
the
war
against
the
english
commerce
must
none
the
less
be
boldly
and
energetically
prosecuted
and
should
start
unexpectedly
the
prizes
which
fall
into
our
hands
must
be
remorselessly
destroyed
since
it
will
usually
be
impossible
owing
to
the
great
english
superiority
and
the
few
bases
we
have
abroad
to
bring
them
back
in
safety
without
exposing
our
vessels
to
great
risks
the
sharpest
measures
must
be
taken
against
neutral
ships
laden
with
contraband
nevertheless
no
very
valuable
results
can
be
expected
from
a
war
against
england
trade
on
the
contrary
england
with
the
numerous
cruisers
and
auxiliary
cruisers
at
her
disposal
would
be
able
to
cripple
our
oversea
commerce
we
must
be
ready
for
a
sudden
attack
even
in
it
is
not
custom
to
let
ideal
considerations
fetter
her
action
if
her
interests
are
at
stake
under
these
circumstances
nothing
would
be
left
for
us
but
to
retire
with
our
under
the
guns
of
the
coast
fortifications
and
by
the
use
of
mines
to
protect
our
own
shores
and
make
them
dangerous
to
english
vessels
mines
are
only
an
effective
hindrance
to
attack
if
they
can
be
defended
but
they
can
cause
considerable
damage
if
the
enemy
has
no
knowledge
of
their
existence
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
further
steps
to
secure
the
importation
from
abroad
of
supplies
necessary
to
us
since
our
own
communications
will
be
completely
cut
off
by
the
english
the
simplest
and
cheapest
way
would
be
if
we
obtained
foreign
goods
through
holland
or
perhaps
neutral
belgium
and
could
export
some
part
of
our
own
products
through
the
great
dutch
and
flemish
harbours
new
commercial
routes
might
be
discovered
through
denmark
our
own
oversea
commerce
would
remain
suspended
but
such
measures
would
prevent
an
absolute
stagnation
of
trade
it
is
however
very
unlikely
that
england
would
tolerate
such
communications
through
neutral
territory
since
in
that
way
the
effect
of
her
war
on
our
trade
would
be
much
reduced
the
attempt
to
block
these
trade
routes
would
approximate
to
a
breach
of
neutrality
and
the
states
in
question
would
have
to
face
the
momentous
question
whether
they
would
conform
to
england
will
and
thus
incur
germany
enmity
or
would
prefer
that
adhesion
to
the
german
empire
which
geography
dictates
they
would
have
the
choice
between
a
naval
war
with
england
and
a
continental
war
with
their
german
neighbours
two
possibilities
each
of
which
contains
great
dangers
that
england
would
pay
much
attention
to
the
neutrality
of
weaker
neighbours
when
such
a
stake
was
at
issue
is
hardly
credible
the
ultimate
decision
of
the
individual
neutral
states
can
not
be
foreseen
it
would
probably
depend
on
the
general
political
position
and
the
attitude
of
the
other
world
powers
to
the
contest
the
policy
adopted
by
france
and
russia
would
be
an
important
factor
one
can
easily
understand
under
these
circumstances
that
the
dutch
are
seriously
proposing
to
fortify
strongly
the
most
important
points
on
their
coast
in
order
to
be
able
to
maintain
their
neutrality
on
the
sea
side
they
are
also
anxious
about
their
eastern
frontier
which
obviously
would
be
threatened
by
a
german
attack
so
soon
as
they
sided
with
our
enemies
i
shall
not
enter
further
into
the
political
and
military
possibilities
which
might
arise
if
holland
belgium
and
denmark
were
driven
to
a
sympathetic
understanding
by
the
war
i
will
only
point
out
how
widespread
an
effect
the
naval
war
can
or
rather
must
exercise
on
the
continental
war
and
on
the
political
relations
generally
the
attitude
of
denmark
would
be
very
important
since
the
passage
to
and
from
the
baltic
must
mainly
depend
on
her
it
is
vital
to
us
that
these
communications
be
kept
open
and
measures
must
be
taken
to
insure
this
the
open
door
through
the
belt
and
the
sound
can
become
highly
important
for
the
conduct
of
the
war
free
commerce
with
sweden
is
essential
for
us
since
our
industries
will
depend
more
and
more
on
the
swedish
as
imports
from
other
countries
become
interrupted
it
will
rest
with
the
general
state
of
affairs
and
the
policy
of
the
interested
nations
whether
this
sea
route
can
be
safeguarded
by
diplomatic
negotiations
or
must
be
kept
open
by
military
action
we
can
not
allow
a
hostile
power
to
occupy
the
danish
islands
complicated
and
grave
questions
military
as
well
as
political
are
thus
raised
by
an
war
our
trade
would
in
any
case
suffer
greatly
for
sea
communications
could
be
cut
off
on
every
side
let
us
assume
that
france
and
russia
seal
our
land
frontiers
then
the
only
trade
route
left
open
to
us
is
through
switzerland
and
austria
a
condition
of
affairs
which
would
aggravate
difficulties
at
home
and
should
stimulate
us
to
carry
on
the
war
with
increased
vigour
in
any
case
when
war
threatens
we
must
lose
no
time
in
preparing
a
road
on
which
we
can
import
the
most
essential
foodstuffs
and
raw
materials
and
also
export
if
only
in
small
quantities
the
surplus
of
our
industrial
products
such
measures
can
not
be
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
they
must
be
elaborated
in
and
a
definite
department
of
the
government
must
be
responsible
for
these
preparations
the
ministry
of
commerce
would
obviously
be
the
appropriate
department
and
should
in
collaboration
with
the
great
commercial
houses
prepare
the
routes
which
our
commerce
must
follow
in
case
of
war
there
must
be
a
sort
of
commercial
mobilization
these
suggestions
indicate
the
preliminary
measures
to
be
adopted
by
us
in
the
eventuality
of
a
war
with
england
we
should
at
first
carry
on
a
defensive
war
and
would
therefore
have
to
reckon
on
a
blockade
of
our
coasts
if
we
succeed
in
repelling
the
probable
english
attack
such
a
blockade
can
be
carried
out
in
two
ways
england
can
blockade
closely
our
north
sea
coast
and
at
the
same
time
bar
the
danish
straits
so
as
to
cut
off
communications
with
our
baltic
ports
or
she
can
seal
up
on
the
one
side
the
channel
between
england
and
the
continent
on
the
other
side
the
open
sea
between
the
north
of
scotland
and
norway
on
the
line
and
thus
cripple
our
oversea
commerce
and
also
control
the
danish
and
swedish
shipping
a
close
blockade
in
the
first
case
would
greatly
tax
the
resources
of
the
english
fleet
according
to
the
view
of
english
experts
if
a
blockade
is
to
be
maintained
permanently
the
distance
between
the
base
and
the
blockading
line
must
not
exceed
nautical
miles
since
all
the
english
naval
ports
are
considerably
farther
than
this
from
our
coast
the
difficulties
of
carrying
on
the
blockade
will
be
enormously
increased
that
appears
to
be
the
reason
why
the
estuary
at
harwich
has
recently
been
transformed
into
a
strong
naval
harbour
it
is
considered
the
best
harbourage
on
the
english
coast
and
is
hardly
nautical
miles
from
the
german
coast
it
offers
good
possibilities
of
fortification
and
safe
ingress
and
egress
in
time
of
war
the
distance
from
the
german
ports
is
not
however
very
material
for
purposes
of
blockade
the
english
if
they
planned
such
a
blockade
would
doubtless
count
on
acquiring
bases
on
our
own
coast
perhaps
also
on
the
dutch
coast
our
task
therefore
is
to
prevent
such
attempts
by
every
means
not
only
must
every
point
which
is
suitable
for
a
base
such
as
heligoland
borkum
and
sylt
be
fortified
in
time
of
peace
but
all
attempts
at
landing
must
be
hindered
and
complicated
by
our
fleet
this
task
can
only
be
fulfilled
by
the
fleet
in
daytime
by
submarines
by
night
may
if
the
landing
forces
are
still
on
board
such
close
blockade
offers
various
possibilities
of
damaging
the
enemy
if
the
coast
fortifications
are
so
constructed
with
a
view
to
the
offensive
that
the
fleet
may
rally
under
their
protection
and
thus
gain
an
opportunity
of
advancing
from
their
stations
for
offensive
operations
such
possibilities
exist
on
our
north
coast
and
our
efforts
must
be
turned
towards
making
the
most
varied
use
of
them
we
must
endeavour
by
renewed
and
unexpected
attacks
especially
by
night
partly
with
submarines
and
partly
with
battleships
to
give
the
blockading
fleet
no
and
to
cause
it
as
much
loss
as
possible
we
must
not
engage
in
a
battle
with
superior
hostile
forces
for
it
is
hardly
possible
at
sea
to
discontinue
a
fight
because
there
is
no
place
whither
the
loser
can
withdraw
from
the
effect
of
the
enemy
guns
an
engagement
once
begun
must
be
fought
out
to
the
end
and
appreciable
damage
can
be
inflicted
on
the
enemy
only
if
a
bold
attack
on
him
is
made
it
is
only
possible
under
exceptionally
favourable
circumstances
such
for
example
as
the
proximity
of
the
fortified
base
to
abandon
a
fight
once
begun
without
very
heavy
losses
it
might
certainly
be
practicable
by
successful
reconnoitring
to
attack
the
enemy
repeatedly
at
times
when
he
is
weakened
in
one
place
or
another
blockade
demands
naturally
a
certain
division
of
forces
and
the
of
the
attacking
party
which
is
supposed
to
lie
behind
the
farthest
lines
of
blockade
and
observation
can
not
always
hold
the
high
seas
in
full
strength
the
forces
of
the
defending
party
however
lie
in
safe
anchorages
ready
to
sally
out
and
fight
such
a
blockade
might
after
all
be
very
costly
to
the
attacking
party
we
may
therefore
fairly
assume
that
the
english
would
decide
in
favour
of
the
second
kind
at
all
events
the
harbour
constructions
partly
building
partly
projected
at
rosyth
and
scapa
flow
were
chosen
with
an
eye
to
this
line
of
blockade
it
would
entail
in
the
north
the
barring
of
a
line
about
nautical
miles
long
a
scheme
quite
feasible
from
the
military
aspect
only
a
small
force
is
required
to
seal
up
the
channel
as
the
navigation
route
is
very
narrow
in
addition
to
all
this
the
great
english
naval
depots
dover
portsmouth
portland
and
plymouth
are
situated
either
on
the
line
of
blockade
or
immediately
behind
it
besides
every
advance
against
this
line
from
the
north
is
flanked
by
sheerness
and
harwich
so
that
a
retreat
to
the
german
coast
might
be
barred
the
conditions
for
the
northern
line
of
blockade
will
be
no
less
favourable
when
the
projected
harbour
works
are
finished
the
blockading
fleet
finds
therefore
a
base
in
the
great
harbour
of
rosyth
while
a
cruiser
squadron
might
lie
in
support
off
the
orkney
isles
every
attacking
fleet
from
the
german
north
coast
will
be
unhesitatingly
attacked
on
the
flank
from
rosyth
and
sheerness
and
cut
off
from
its
line
of
retreat
it
is
thus
almost
impossible
owing
to
the
english
superiority
to
inflict
any
serious
damage
on
the
blockading
fleet
on
this
line
and
the
only
course
left
is
to
advance
from
the
baltic
against
the
part
of
the
blockading
line
here
we
should
have
a
tolerably
secure
retreat
this
accentuates
once
more
the
supreme
importance
to
us
of
keeping
open
at
all
costs
the
passage
through
the
sound
and
the
great
belt
the
command
of
these
straits
will
not
only
secure
the
baltic
basin
for
us
but
also
keep
open
the
for
our
offensive
operations
against
the
english
blockading
fleet
in
spite
of
all
the
advantages
which
the
extended
system
of
blockade
offers
to
the
english
there
are
two
objections
against
it
which
are
well
worth
considering
from
the
english
point
of
view
firstly
it
prejudices
the
interests
of
a
number
of
nations
whose
coasts
are
washed
by
the
north
sea
and
the
baltic
since
they
are
included
in
the
blockade
secondly
it
compels
england
to
break
up
her
fleet
into
two
or
three
divisions
as
to
the
first
objection
we
have
hinted
that
england
will
scarcely
let
herself
be
hindered
in
the
pursuit
of
her
own
advantage
by
the
interests
of
weaker
third
parties
it
is
also
conceivable
that
some
satisfactory
arrangement
as
to
the
blockade
can
be
made
with
the
states
affected
as
regards
the
splitting
up
of
the
fleet
no
especially
disadvantageous
conditions
are
thereby
produced
it
is
easy
to
reunite
the
temporarily
divided
parts
and
the
strength
of
the
combined
fleet
guarantees
the
superiority
of
the
separate
divisions
over
the
german
forces
at
sea
nevertheless
this
division
of
the
attacking
fleet
gives
the
defending
party
the
chance
of
attacking
some
detached
portions
before
junction
with
the
main
body
and
of
inflicting
loss
on
them
if
the
enemy
can
be
deceived
and
surprised
by
prompt
action
the
demonstrations
which
are
the
ordinary
tactics
in
war
on
land
under
such
conditions
can
not
be
employed
owing
to
the
facility
with
which
the
sea
can
be
patrolled
this
blockade
would
ultimately
weaken
and
weary
the
attacking
party
but
it
must
be
recognized
that
it
is
a
far
easier
plan
to
carry
out
than
the
close
blockade
and
that
it
would
tax
the
offensive
powers
of
our
fleet
more
severely
we
should
not
only
have
to
venture
on
attacks
in
waters
but
must
be
strong
enough
to
protect
efficiently
the
threatened
flank
of
our
attacking
fleet
after
all
it
is
improbable
that
the
english
would
have
recourse
to
a
mere
blockade
the
reasons
which
would
prompt
them
to
a
rapid
decision
of
the
war
have
been
already
explained
it
was
shown
that
in
the
event
of
their
fighting
in
alliance
with
france
they
would
probably
attempt
to
land
troops
in
order
to
support
their
fleet
from
the
land
side
they
could
not
obtain
a
decisive
result
unless
they
attempted
to
capture
our
naval
bases
wilhelmshaven
heligoland
the
mouth
of
the
elbe
and
kiel
and
to
annihilate
our
fleet
in
its
attempt
to
protect
these
places
and
thus
render
it
impossible
for
us
to
continue
the
war
by
sea
it
is
equally
certain
that
our
land
forces
would
actively
operate
against
the
english
attempts
at
landing
and
that
they
would
afford
extraordinarily
important
assistance
to
the
defence
of
the
coast
by
protecting
it
against
attacks
from
the
rear
and
by
keeping
open
the
communications
with
the
hinterland
the
success
of
the
english
attack
will
much
depend
on
the
strength
and
armament
of
the
coast
fortifications
such
a
war
will
clearly
show
their
value
both
as
purely
defensive
and
as
offensive
works
our
whole
future
history
may
turn
upon
the
impregnability
of
the
fortifications
which
in
combination
with
the
fleet
are
intended
to
guard
our
coasts
and
naval
bases
and
should
inflict
such
heavy
losses
on
the
enemy
that
the
difference
of
strength
between
the
two
fleets
would
be
gradually
equalized
our
ships
it
must
be
remembered
can
only
act
effectively
so
long
as
our
coast
fortifications
hold
out
no
proof
is
required
that
a
good
intelligence
system
is
essential
to
a
defensive
which
is
based
on
the
policy
of
striking
unexpected
blows
such
a
system
alone
can
guarantee
the
right
choice
of
favourable
moments
for
attack
and
can
give
us
such
early
information
of
the
operative
movements
of
the
hostile
fleet
that
we
can
take
the
requisite
measures
for
defence
and
always
retreat
before
an
attack
in
superior
numbers
the
numerical
superiority
of
the
english
cruisers
is
so
great
that
we
shall
probably
only
be
able
to
guarantee
rapid
and
trustworthy
scouting
by
the
help
of
the
the
importance
of
the
must
not
therefore
be
and
steps
must
be
taken
to
repel
the
enemy
airships
either
by
employing
specially
contrived
cannons
or
by
attacking
them
directly
if
it
is
possible
to
employ
airships
for
offensive
purposes
also
they
would
support
our
own
fleet
in
their
contest
with
the
superior
english
force
by
dropping
explosives
on
the
enemy
ships
and
might
thus
contribute
towards
gradually
restoring
the
equilibrium
of
the
opposing
forces
these
possibilities
are
however
vague
the
ships
are
protected
to
some
extent
by
their
armour
against
such
explosives
as
could
be
dropped
from
airships
and
it
is
not
easy
to
aim
correctly
from
a
balloon
but
the
possibility
of
such
methods
of
attack
must
be
kept
in
mind
so
far
as
aviation
goes
the
defending
party
has
the
advantage
for
starting
from
the
german
coast
our
airships
and
would
be
able
to
operate
against
the
english
attacking
fleet
more
successfully
than
the
english
airships
against
our
forts
and
vessels
since
they
would
have
as
a
base
either
the
fleet
itself
or
the
distant
english
coast
such
possibilities
of
superiority
must
be
carefully
watched
for
and
nothing
must
be
neglected
which
could
injure
the
enemy
while
the
boldest
spirit
of
attack
and
the
most
reckless
audacity
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
employment
of
every
means
which
mechanical
skill
and
the
science
of
naval
construction
and
fortification
can
supply
this
is
the
only
way
by
which
we
may
hope
so
to
weaken
our
proud
opponent
that
we
may
in
the
end
challenge
him
to
a
decisive
engagement
on
the
open
sea
in
this
war
we
conquer
or
at
any
rate
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
defeated
for
it
will
decide
whether
we
can
attain
a
position
as
a
world
power
by
the
side
of
and
in
spite
of
england
this
victory
will
not
be
gained
merely
in
the
exclusive
interests
of
germany
we
shall
in
this
struggle
as
so
often
before
represent
the
common
interests
of
the
world
for
it
will
be
fought
not
only
to
win
recognition
for
ourselves
but
for
the
freedom
of
the
seas
this
was
the
great
aim
of
russia
under
the
empress
catherine
of
france
under
napoleon
and
spasmodically
down
to
in
the
last
pages
of
her
history
and
the
great
republic
of
the
united
states
of
north
america
strives
for
it
with
intense
energy
it
is
the
development
of
the
right
of
nations
for
which
every
people
craves
a
footnote
a
schiemann
in
such
a
contest
we
should
not
stand
spiritually
alone
but
all
on
this
vast
globe
whose
feelings
and
thoughts
are
proud
and
free
will
join
us
in
this
campaign
against
the
overweening
ambitions
of
one
nation
which
in
spite
of
all
her
pretence
of
a
liberal
and
a
philanthropic
policy
has
never
sought
any
other
object
than
personal
advantage
and
the
unscrupulous
suppression
of
her
rivals
if
the
french
fleet
as
we
may
expect
combines
with
the
english
and
takes
part
in
the
war
it
will
be
much
more
difficult
for
us
to
wage
than
a
war
with
england
alone
france
fleet
would
hold
our
allies
in
the
mediterranean
in
check
and
england
could
bring
all
her
forces
to
bear
upon
us
it
would
be
possible
that
combined
fleets
of
the
two
powers
might
appear
both
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
north
sea
since
england
could
hardly
leave
the
protection
of
her
mediterranean
interests
to
france
alone
the
prospect
of
any
ultimately
successful
issue
would
thus
shrink
into
the
background
but
we
need
not
even
then
despair
on
the
contrary
we
must
fight
the
french
fleet
so
to
speak
on
land
we
must
defeat
france
so
decisively
that
she
would
be
compelled
to
renounce
her
alliance
with
england
and
withdraw
her
fleet
to
save
herself
from
total
destruction
just
as
in
we
marched
to
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
so
this
time
again
we
must
resolve
on
an
absolute
conquest
in
order
to
capture
the
french
naval
ports
and
destroy
the
french
naval
depots
it
would
be
a
war
to
the
knife
with
france
one
which
would
if
victorious
annihilate
once
for
all
the
french
position
as
a
great
power
if
france
with
her
falling
determines
on
such
a
war
it
is
at
the
risk
of
losing
her
place
in
the
first
rank
of
european
nations
and
sinking
into
permanent
political
subservience
those
are
the
stakes
the
participation
of
russia
in
the
naval
war
must
also
be
contemplated
that
is
the
less
dangerous
since
the
russian
baltic
fleet
is
at
present
still
weak
and
can
not
combine
so
easily
as
the
english
with
the
french
we
could
operate
against
it
on
the
inner
line
we
could
use
the
opportunity
of
uniting
rapidly
our
vessels
in
the
baltic
by
means
of
the
canal
we
could
attack
the
russian
ships
in
vastly
superior
force
and
having
struck
our
blow
we
could
return
to
the
north
sea
for
these
operations
it
is
of
the
first
importance
that
the
danish
straits
should
not
be
occupied
by
the
enemy
if
they
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
english
all
free
operations
in
the
baltic
would
be
almost
impossible
and
our
baltic
coast
would
then
be
abandoned
to
the
passive
protection
of
our
coast
batteries
chapter
ix
the
crucial
question
i
have
examined
the
probable
conditions
of
the
next
naval
war
in
some
detail
because
i
thought
that
our
general
political
and
military
position
can
only
be
properly
estimated
by
considering
the
various
phases
of
the
war
by
sea
and
by
land
and
by
realizing
the
possibilities
and
dangers
arising
from
the
combined
action
of
the
hostile
forces
on
our
coasts
and
land
frontiers
in
this
way
only
can
the
direction
be
decided
in
which
our
preparations
for
war
ought
to
move
the
considerations
then
to
which
the
discussion
about
the
naval
war
with
england
and
her
probable
allies
gave
rise
have
shown
that
we
shall
need
to
make
very
great
exertions
to
protect
ourselves
successfully
from
a
hostile
attack
by
sea
they
also
proved
that
we
can
not
count
on
an
ultimate
victory
at
sea
unless
we
are
victorious
on
land
if
an
army
invaded
north
germany
through
holland
and
threatened
our
coast
defences
in
the
rear
it
would
soon
paralyze
our
defence
by
sea
the
same
argument
applies
to
the
eastern
theatre
if
russian
armies
advance
victoriously
along
the
baltic
and
with
a
combined
fleet
of
our
opponents
any
continuation
of
the
naval
war
would
be
rendered
futile
by
the
operations
of
the
enemy
on
land
we
know
also
that
it
is
of
primary
importance
to
organize
our
forces
on
land
so
thoroughly
that
they
guarantee
the
possibility
under
all
circumstances
of
our
victoriously
maintaining
our
position
on
the
continent
of
europe
this
position
must
be
made
absolutely
safe
before
we
can
successfully
carry
on
a
war
by
sea
and
follow
an
imperial
policy
based
on
naval
power
so
long
as
rome
was
threatened
by
hannibal
in
italy
there
could
be
no
possible
idea
of
empire
she
did
not
begin
her
triumphal
progress
in
history
until
she
was
thoroughly
secure
in
her
own
country
but
our
discussion
shows
also
that
success
on
land
can
be
influenced
by
the
naval
war
if
the
enemy
succeeds
in
destroying
our
fleet
and
landing
with
strong
detachments
on
the
north
sea
coast
large
forces
of
the
land
army
would
be
required
to
repel
them
a
circumstance
widely
affecting
the
progress
of
the
war
on
the
land
frontiers
it
is
therefore
vitally
necessary
to
prepare
the
defence
of
our
own
coasts
so
well
that
every
attack
even
by
superior
numbers
may
be
victoriously
repelled
at
the
same
time
the
consideration
of
the
political
position
presses
the
conviction
home
that
in
our
preparations
for
war
there
must
be
no
talk
of
a
gradual
development
of
our
forces
by
sea
and
land
such
as
may
lay
the
lightest
possible
burden
on
the
national
finances
and
leave
ample
scope
for
activity
in
the
sphere
of
culture
the
crucial
point
is
to
put
aside
all
other
considerations
and
to
prepare
ourselves
with
the
utmost
energy
for
a
war
which
appears
to
be
imminent
and
will
decide
the
whole
future
of
our
politics
and
our
civilization
the
consideration
of
the
broad
lines
of
the
world
policy
and
of
the
political
aspirations
of
the
individual
states
showed
that
the
position
of
affairs
everywhere
is
critical
for
us
that
we
live
at
an
epoch
which
will
decide
our
place
as
a
world
power
or
our
downfall
the
internal
disruption
of
the
triple
alliance
as
shown
clearly
by
the
action
of
italy
towards
turkey
threatens
to
bring
the
crisis
quickly
to
a
head
the
period
which
destiny
has
allotted
us
for
concentrating
our
forces
and
preparing
ourselves
for
the
deadly
struggle
may
soon
be
passed
we
must
use
it
if
we
wish
to
be
mindful
of
the
warning
of
the
great
elector
that
we
are
germans
this
is
the
point
of
view
from
which
we
must
carry
out
our
preparations
for
war
by
sea
and
land
thus
only
can
we
be
true
to
our
national
duty
i
do
not
mean
that
we
should
adopt
precipitately
measures
calculated
merely
for
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
all
that
we
undertake
in
the
cause
of
military
efficiency
must
meet
two
requirements
it
must
answer
the
pressing
questions
of
the
present
and
aid
the
development
of
the
future
but
we
must
find
the
danger
of
our
position
a
stimulus
to
desperate
exertions
so
that
we
may
regain
at
the
eleventh
hour
something
of
what
we
have
lost
in
the
last
years
since
the
crucial
point
is
to
safeguard
our
position
on
the
continent
of
europe
we
must
first
of
all
face
the
serious
problem
of
the
land
war
by
what
means
we
can
hope
to
overcome
the
great
numerical
superiority
of
our
enemies
such
superiority
will
certainly
exist
if
italy
ceases
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
triple
alliance
whether
nominally
belonging
to
it
or
politically
going
over
to
irredentism
the
preparations
for
the
naval
war
are
of
secondary
importance
the
first
essential
requirement
in
case
of
a
war
by
land
is
to
make
the
total
fighting
strength
of
the
nation
available
for
war
to
educate
the
entire
youth
of
the
country
in
the
use
of
arms
and
to
make
universal
service
an
existing
fact
the
system
of
universal
service
born
in
the
hour
of
need
has
by
a
splendid
development
of
strength
liberated
us
from
a
foreign
yoke
has
in
long
years
of
peace
educated
a
powerful
and
people
and
has
brought
us
victory
upon
victory
in
the
german
wars
of
unification
its
importance
for
the
social
evolution
of
the
nation
has
been
discussed
in
a
separate
chapter
the
german
empire
would
have
a
mighty
political
importance
if
we
had
been
loyal
to
the
principle
on
which
our
greatness
was
founded
france
has
at
the
present
day
a
population
of
some
russia
in
europe
with
poland
and
the
caucasus
has
a
population
of
contrasted
with
this
germany
has
only
inhabitants
but
since
the
russian
military
forces
are
to
a
great
extent
hampered
by
very
various
causes
and
can
not
be
employed
at
any
one
time
or
place
and
are
also
deficient
in
military
value
a
german
army
which
corresponded
to
the
population
would
be
certainly
in
a
position
to
defend
itself
successfully
against
its
two
enemies
if
it
operated
resolutely
on
the
inner
line
even
though
england
took
part
in
the
war
disastrously
for
ourselves
we
have
become
disloyal
to
the
idea
of
universal
military
service
and
have
apparently
definitely
discontinued
to
carry
it
out
effectively
the
country
where
universal
service
exists
is
now
france
with
us
indeed
it
is
still
talked
about
but
it
is
only
kept
up
in
pretence
for
in
reality
per
perhaps
of
the
are
called
up
for
training
in
particular
very
little
use
has
been
made
of
the
larger
towns
as
for
the
army
in
this
direction
some
reorganization
is
required
which
will
energetically
combine
the
forces
of
the
nation
and
create
a
real
army
such
as
we
have
not
at
the
present
time
unless
we
satisfy
this
demand
we
shall
not
long
be
able
to
hold
our
own
against
the
hostile
powers
although
we
recognize
this
necessity
as
a
national
duty
we
must
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
it
is
impossible
in
a
short
time
to
make
up
our
deficiencies
our
peace
army
can
not
be
suddenly
increased
by
men
the
necessary
training
staff
and
equipment
would
not
be
forthcoming
and
on
the
financial
side
the
required
expenditure
could
not
all
at
once
be
incurred
the
full
effectiveness
of
an
increased
army
only
begins
to
be
gradually
felt
when
the
number
of
reservists
and
landwehr
is
correspondingly
raised
we
can
therefore
only
slowly
recur
to
the
reinforcement
of
universal
service
the
note
struck
by
the
new
five
years
act
can
not
be
justified
on
any
grounds
but
although
we
wish
to
increase
our
army
on
a
more
extensive
scale
we
must
admit
that
even
if
we
strain
our
resources
the
process
can
only
work
slowly
and
that
we
can
not
hope
for
a
long
time
to
equalize
even
approximately
the
superior
forces
of
our
opponents
we
must
not
therefore
be
content
merely
to
strengthen
our
army
we
must
devise
other
means
of
gaining
the
upper
hand
of
our
enemies
these
means
can
only
be
found
in
the
spiritual
domain
history
teaches
us
by
countless
examples
that
numbers
in
themselves
have
only
been
the
decisive
factor
in
war
when
the
opponents
have
been
equally
matched
otherwise
or
when
the
superiority
of
the
one
party
exceeds
the
proportion
required
by
the
numerical
law
a
in
most
cases
it
was
a
special
advantage
possessed
by
the
one
party
better
equipment
greater
efficiency
of
troops
brilliant
leadership
or
more
able
strategy
which
led
to
victory
over
the
numerically
superior
rome
conquered
the
world
with
inferior
forces
frederick
the
great
with
inferior
forces
withstood
the
allied
armies
of
europe
recent
history
shows
us
the
victory
of
the
numerically
weaker
japanese
army
over
a
crushingly
superior
opponent
we
can
not
count
on
seeing
a
great
commander
at
our
head
a
second
frederick
the
great
will
hardly
appear
nor
can
we
know
beforehand
whether
our
troops
will
prove
superior
to
the
hostile
forces
but
we
can
try
to
learn
what
will
be
the
decisive
factors
in
the
future
war
which
will
turn
the
scale
in
favour
of
victory
or
defeat
if
we
know
this
and
prepare
for
war
with
a
set
purpose
and
keep
the
essential
points
of
view
always
before
us
we
might
create
a
real
source
of
superiority
and
gain
a
start
on
our
opponents
which
would
be
hard
for
them
to
make
up
in
the
course
of
the
war
should
we
then
in
the
war
itself
follow
one
dominating
principle
of
the
policy
which
results
from
the
special
nature
of
war
it
must
be
possible
to
gain
a
positive
advantage
which
may
even
equalize
a
considerable
numerical
superiority

the
essential
point
is
not
to
match
battalion
with
battalion
battery
with
battery
or
to
command
a
number
of
cannons
machine
guns
airships
and
other
mechanical
contrivances
equal
to
that
of
the
probable
opponent
it
is
foolish
initiative
to
strain
every
nerve
to
be
abreast
with
the
enemy
in
all
material
domains
this
idea
leads
to
a
certain
spiritual
servility
and
inferiority
rather
must
an
effort
be
made
to
win
superiority
in
the
factors
on
which
the
ultimate
decision
turns
the
duty
of
our
war
department
is
to
prepare
these
decisive
elements
of
strength
while
still
at
peace
and
to
apply
them
in
war
according
to
a
clearly
recognized
principle
of
superiority
this
must
secure
for
us
the
spiritual
and
so
the
material
advantage
over
our
enemies
otherwise
we
run
the
danger
of
being
crushed
by
their
weight
of
numbers
we
can
not
reach
this
goal
on
the
beaten
roads
of
tradition
and
habit
by
uninspired
rivalry
in
arming
we
must
trace
out
with
clear
insight
the
probable
course
of
the
future
war
and
must
not
be
afraid
to
tread
new
paths
if
needs
be
which
are
not
consecrated
by
experience
and
use
new
goals
can
only
be
reached
by
new
roads
and
our
military
history
teaches
us
by
numerous
instances
how
the
source
of
superiority
lies
in
progress
in
conscious
innovations
based
on
convincing
arguments
the
spiritual
capacity
to
know
where
under
altered
conditions
the
decision
must
be
sought
and
the
spiritual
courage
to
resolve
on
this
new
line
of
action
are
the
soil
in
which
great
successes
ripen
it
would
be
too
long
a
task
in
this
place
to
examine
more
closely
the
nature
of
the
future
war
in
order
to
develop
systematically
the
ideas
which
will
prove
decisive
in
it
these
questions
have
been
thoroughly
ventilated
in
a
book
recently
published
by

the
war
of
in
this
place
i
will
only
condense
the
results
of
my
inquiry
in
order
to
form
a
foundation
for
the
further
consideration
of
the
essential
questions
of
the
future
in
a
future
european
war
masses
will
be
employed
to
an
extent
unprecedented
in
any
previous
one
weapons
will
be
used
whose
deadliness
will
exceed
all
previous
experience
more
effective
and
varied
means
of
communication
will
be
available
than
were
known
in
earlier
wars
these
three
momentous
factors
will
mark
the
war
of
the
future
masses
signify
in
themselves
an
increase
of
strength
but
they
contain
elements
of
weakness
as
well
the
larger
they
are
and
the
less
they
can
be
commanded
by
professional
soldiers
the
more
their
tactical
efficiency
diminishes
the
less
they
are
able
to
live
on
the
country
during
especially
when
concentrated
and
the
more
they
are
therefore
dependent
on
the
daily
renewal
of
the
slower
and
less
mobile
they
become
owing
to
the
great
space
which
they
require
for
their
deployment
it
is
extraordinarily
difficult
to
bring
them
into
effective
action
simultaneously
they
are
also
far
more
accessible
to
morally
depressing
influences
than
compacter
bodies
of
troops
and
may
prove
dangerous
to
the
strategy
of
their
own
leaders
if
supplies
run
short
if
discipline
breaks
down
and
the
commander
loses
his
authority
over
the
masses
which
he
can
only
rule
under
regulated
conditions
the
increased
effectiveness
of
weapons
does
not
merely
imply
a
longer
range
but
a
greater
deadliness
and
therefore
makes
more
exacting
claims
on
the
of
the
soldier
the
danger
zone
begins
sooner
than
formerly
the
space
which
must
be
crossed
in
an
attack
has
become
far
wider
it
must
be
passed
by
the
attacking
party
creeping
or
running
the
soldier
must
often
use
the
spade
in
defensive
operations
during
which
he
is
exposed
to
a
far
hotter
fire
than
formerly
while
under
all
circumstances
he
must
shoot
more
than
in
bygone
days
the
quick
firing
which
the
troop
encounters
increases
the
losses
at
every
incautious
movement
all
branches
of
arms
have
to
suffer
under
these
circumstances
shelter
and
supplies
will
be
more
scanty
than
ever
before
in
short
while
the
troops
on
the
average
have
diminished
in
value
the
demands
made
on
them
have
become
considerably
greater
improved
means
of
communication
finally
facilitate
the
handling
and
feeding
of
large
masses
but
tie
them
down
to
railway
systems
and
main
roads
and
must
if
they
fail
or
break
down
in
the
course
of
a
campaign
aggravate
the
difficulties
because
the
troops
were
accustomed
to
their
use
and
the
commanders
counted
upon
them
the
direct
conclusion
to
be
drawn
from
these
reflections
is
that
a
great
superiority
must
rest
with
the
troops
whose
fighting
capabilities
and
tactical
efficiency
are
greater
than
those
of
their
antagonists
the
commander
who
can
carry
out
all
operations
quicker
than
the
enemy
and
can
concentrate
and
employ
greater
masses
in
a
narrow
space
than
they
can
will
always
be
in
a
position
to
collect
a
numerically
superior
force
in
the
decisive
direction
if
he
controls
the
more
effective
troops
he
will
gain
decisive
successes
against
one
part
of
the
hostile
army
and
will
be
able
to
exploit
them
against
other
divisions
of
it
before
the
enemy
can
gain
equivalent
advantages
in
other
parts
of
the
field
since
the
tactical
efficiency
and
the
of
the
troops
are
chiefly
shown
in
the
offensive
and
are
then
most
needful
the
necessary
conclusion
is
that
safety
only
lies
in
offensive
warfare
in
an
attack
the
advantage
apart
from
the
elements
of
moral
strength
which
it
brings
into
play
depends
chiefly
on
rapidity
of
action
inasmuch
as
the
attacking
party
determines
the
direction
of
the
attack
to
suit
his
own
plans
he
is
able
at
the
selected
spot
to
collect
a
superior
force
against
his
surprised
opponent
the
initiative
which
is
the
privilege
of
the
attacking
party
gives
a
start
in
time
and
place
which
is
very
profitable
in
operations
and
tactics
the
attacked
party
can
only
equalize
this
advantage
if
he
has
early
intimation
of
the
intentions
of
the
assailant
and
has
time
to
take
measures
which
hold
out
promise
of
success
the
more
rapidly
therefore
the
attacking
general
strikes
his
blow
and
gains
his
success
and
the
more
capable
his
troops
the
greater
is
the
superiority
which
the
attack
in
its
nature
guarantees
this
superiority
increases
with
the
size
of
the
masses
if
the
advancing
armies
are
large
and
unwieldy
and
the
distances
to
be
covered
great
it
will
be
a
difficult
and
tedious
task
for
the
defending
commander
to
take
proper
measures
against
a
surprise
attack
on
the
other
hand
the
prospects
of
success
of
the
attacking
general
will
be
very
favourable
especially
if
he
is
in
the
fortunate
position
of
having
better
troops
at
his
disposal
finally
the
initiative
secures
to
the
numerically
weaker
a
possibility
of
gaining
the
victory
even
when
other
conditions
are
equal
and
all
the
more
so
the
greater
the
masses
engaged
in
most
cases
it
is
impossible
to
bring
the
entire
mass
of
a
modern
army
simultaneously
and
completely
into
action
a
victory
therefore
in
the
decisive
direction
the
direction
that
is
which
directly
cuts
the
arteries
of
the
opponent
is
usually
conclusive
for
the
whole
course
of
the
war
and
its
effect
is
felt
in
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
field
of
operations
if
the
assailant
therefore
can
advance
in
this
direction
with
superior
numbers
and
can
win
the
day
because
the
enemy
can
not
utilize
his
numerical
superiority
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
ultimate
victory
over
the
arithmetically
stronger
army
in
conformity
to
this
law
frederick
the
great
through
superior
tactical
capability
and
striking
strength
had
always
the
upper
hand
of
an
enemy
far
more
powerful
in
mere
numbers
no
further
proof
is
required
that
the
superiority
of
the
attack
increases
in
proportion
to
the
rapidity
with
which
it
is
delivered
and
to
the
lack
of
mobility
of
the
hostile
forces
hence
the
possibility
of
concealing
one
own
movements
and
damaging
the
effective
tactics
of
the
enemy
secures
an
advantage
which
though
indirect
is
yet
very
appreciable
we
arrive
then
at
the
conclusion
that
in
order
to
secure
the
superiority
in
a
war
of
the
future
under
otherwise
equal
conditions
it
is
incumbent
on
us
first
during
the
period
of
preparation
to
raise
the
tactical
value
and
capabilities
of
the
troops
as
much
as
possible
and
especially
to
develop
the
means
of
concealing
the
attacking
movements
and
damaging
the
enemy
tactical
powers
secondly
in
the
war
itself
to
act
on
the
offensive
and
strike
the
first
blow
and
to
exploit
the
manoeuvring
capacity
of
the
troops
as
much
as
possible
in
order
to
be
superior
in
the
decisive
directions
above
all
a
state
which
has
objects
to
attain
that
can
not
be
relinquished
and
is
exposed
to
attacks
by
enemies
more
powerful
than
itself
is
bound
to
act
in
this
sense
it
must
before
all
things
develop
the
attacking
powers
of
its
army
since
a
strategic
defensive
must
often
adopt
offensive
methods
this
principle
holds
good
for
germany
the
points
which
i
have
tried
to
emphasize
must
never
be
lost
sight
of
if
we
wish
to
face
the
future
with
confidence
all
our
measures
must
be
calculated
to
raise
the
efficiency
of
the
army
especially
in
attack
to
this
end
all
else
must
give
way
we
shall
thus
have
a
central
point
on
which
all
our
measures
can
be
focussed
we
can
make
them
all
serve
one
purpose
and
thus
we
shall
be
kept
from
going
astray
on
the
bypaths
which
we
all
too
easily
take
if
we
regard
matters
separately
and
not
as
forming
parts
of
a
collective
whole
much
of
our
previous
omissions
and
commissions
would
have
borne
a
quite
different
complexion
had
we
observed
this
unifying
principle
the
requirements
which
i
have
described
as
the
most
essential
are
somewhat
opposed
to
the
trend
of
our
present
efforts
and
necessitate
a
resolute
resistance
to
the
controlling
forces
of
our
age
the
larger
the
armies
by
which
one
state
tries
to
outbid
another
the
smaller
will
be
the
efficiency
and
tactical
worth
of
the
troops
and
not
merely
the
average
worth
but
the
worth
of
each
separate
detachment
as
such
huge
armies
are
even
a
danger
to
their
own
cause
they
will
be
suffocated
by
their
own
fat
said
general
brandenstein
the
great
organizer
of
the
advance
of
when
speaking
of
the
of
the
french
the
complete
neglect
of
cavalry
in
their
proportion
to
the
whole
bulk
of
the
army
has
deprived
the
commander
of
the
means
to
injure
the
tactical
capabilities
of
the
enemy
and
to
screen
effectually
his
own
movements
the
necessary
attention
has
never
been
paid
in
the
course
of
military
training
to
this
latter
duty
finally
the
tactical
efficiency
of
troops
has
never
been
regarded
as
so
essential
as
it
certainly
will
prove
in
the
wars
of
the
future
a
mechanical
notion
of
warfare
and
weak
concessions
to
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
and
often
a
defective
grasp
of
the
actual
needs
have
conduced
to
measures
which
inevitably
result
in
an
essential
contradiction
between
the
needs
of
the
army
and
the
actual
end
attained
and
can
not
be
justified
from
the
purely
military
point
of
view
it
would
be
illogical
and
irrelevant
to
continue
in
these
paths
so
soon
as
it
is
recognized
that
the
desired
superiority
over
the
enemy
can
not
be
reached
on
them
this
essential
contradiction
between
what
is
necessary
and
what
is
attained
appears
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
of
universal
military
service
opinion
oscillates
between
the
wish
to
enforce
it
more
or
less
and
the
disinclination
to
make
the
required
outlay
and
recourse
is
had
to
all
sorts
of
subterfuges
which
may
save
appearances
without
giving
a
good
trial
to
the
system
one
of
these
methods
is
the
which
is
once
more
being
frequently
proposed
but
the
situation
is
by
no
means
helped
by
the
very
brief
training
which
these
units
at
best
receive
this
system
only
creates
a
military
mob
which
has
no
capacity
for
serious
military
operations
such
an
institution
would
be
a
heavy
strain
on
the
existing
teaching
in
the
army
and
would
be
indirectly
detrimental
to
it
as
well
nor
would
any
strengthening
of
the
field
army
be
possible
under
this
scheme
since
the
cadres
to
contain
the
mass
of
these
special
reservists
are
not
ready
to
hand
this
mass
would
therefore
only
fill
up
the
recruiting
depots
and
facilitate
to
some
degree
the
task
of
making
good
the
losses
a
similar
contradiction
is
often
shown
in
the
employment
of
the
troops
every
army
at
the
present
time
is
divided
into
regular
troops
who
are
already
organized
in
time
of
peace
and
are
merely
brought
to
full
strength
in
and
new
formations
which
are
only
organized
on
mobilization
the
tactical
value
of
these
latter
varies
much
according
to
their
composition
and
the
age
of
the
units
but
is
always
much
inferior
to
that
of
the
regular
troops
the
landwehr
formations
which
were
employed
in
the
field
in
were
an
example
of
this
notwithstanding
the
excellent
services
which
they
rendered
and
the
new
french
formations
in
that
campaign
were
totally
ineffective
the
sphere
of
activity
of
such
troops
is
the
second
line
in
an
offensive
war
their
duty
is
to
secure
the
railroads
and
bases
to
garrison
the
conquered
territory
and
partly
also
to
besiege
the
enemies
fortresses
in
fact
they
must
discharge
all
the
duties
which
would
otherwise
weaken
the
field
army
in
a
defensive
war
they
will
have
to
undertake
the
local
and
mainly
passive
defence
and
the
support
of
the
national
war
by
acting
at
first
in
this
limited
sphere
such
new
formations
will
gradually
become
fitted
for
the
duties
of
the
war
and
will
acquire
a
degree
of
offensive
strength
which
certainly
can
not
be
reckoned
upon
at
the
outset
of
the
war
and
the
less
adequately
such
bodies
of
troops
are
supplied
with
columns
trains
and
cavalry
the
less
their
value
will
be
nevertheless
it
appears
to
be
assumed
by
us
that
in
event
of
war
such
troops
will
be
partly
available
in
the
first
line
and
that
decisive
operations
may
be
entrusted
to
them
reserves
and
regulars
are
treated
as
equivalent
pieces
on
the
board
and
no
one
seems
to
suppose
that
some
are
less
effective
than
others
a
great
danger
lies
in
this
mechanical
conception
for
operations
in
the
field
we
must
employ
wherever
possible
regulars
only
and
rather
limit
our
numbers
than
assign
to
inferior
troops
tasks
for
which
they
are
inadequate
we
must
have
the
courage
to
attack
if
necessary
with
troops
numerically
inferior
but
tactically
superior
and
more
efficient
we
must
attack
in
the
consciousness
that
tactical
striking
power
and
efficiency
outweigh
the
advantages
of
greater
numbers
and
that
with
the
immense
modern
armies
a
victory
in
the
decisive
direction
has
more
bearing
on
the
ultimate
issue
than
ever
before
the
decision
depends
on
the
regular
troops
not
on
the
masses
which
are
placed
at
their
side
on
mobilization
the
commander
who
acts
on
this
principle
and
so
far
restricts
himself
in
the
employment
of
masses
that
he
preserves
the
complete
mobility
of
the
armies
will
win
a
strong
advantage
over
the
one
whose
leader
is
burdened
with
inferior
troops
and
therefore
is
handicapped
generally
and
has
paid
for
the
size
of
his
army
by
want
of
efficiency
the
mass
of
reserves
must
therefore
be
employed
as
subsidiary
to
the
regular
troops
whom
they
must
relieve
as
much
as
possible
from
all
minor
duties
thus
used
a
superiority
in
the
numbers
of
national
reserves
will
secure
an
undoubted
superiority
in
the
actual
war
it
follows
directly
from
this
argument
that
we
must
do
our
best
to
render
the
regular
army
strong
and
efficient
and
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
weaken
them
unnecessarily
by
excessive
drafts
upon
their
with
the
object
of
making
the
reserves
tactically
equal
to
them
this
aim
may
sometimes
be
realized
but
the
general
level
of
efficiency
throughout
the
troops
would
be
lowered
our
one
object
must
therefore
be
to
strengthen
our
regular
army
an
increase
of
the
peace
footing
of
the
standing
army
is
worth
far
more
than
a
far
greater
number
of
badly
trained
special
reservists
it
is
supremely
important
to
increase
the
strength
of
the
officers
on
the
establishment
the
stronger
each
unit
is
in
peace
the
more
efficient
will
it
become
for
war
hence
the
vital
importance
of
aiming
at
quality
not
quantity
concentration
not
dilution
will
be
our
safeguard
if
we
wish
to
encourage
the
enforcement
of
universal
service
by
strengthening
the
army
we
must
organize
new
peace
formations
since
the
number
of
professional
officers
and
will
be
thus
increased
this
step
is
the
more
necessary
because
the
present
available
cadres
are
insufficient
to
receive
the
mass
of
recruits
and
to
provide
for
their
thorough
training
the
gradual
enforcement
of
universal
military
service
hand
in
hand
with
an
increase
of
the
regular
army
is
the
first
practical
requirement
we
shall
now
consider
how
far
the
tactical
value
of
the
troops
the
efficiency
of
the
army
the
cavalry
and
the
screening
service
can
be
improved
by
organization
equipment
and
training
i
must
first
point
out
a
factor
which
lies
in
a
different
sphere
to
the
questions
already
discussed
but
has
great
importance
in
every
branch
of
military
activity
especially
in
the
offensive
which
requires
prompt
original
action
i
mean
the
importance
of
personality
from
the
who
puts
into
execution
the
conceptions
of
his
own
brain
under
the
pressure
of
responsibility
and
shifting
fortune
and
the
brigadier
who
must
act
independently
according
to
a
given
general
scheme
to
the
dispatch
rider
surrounded
with
dangers
and
left
to
his
own
resources
in
the
enemy
country
and
the
youngest
private
in
the
field
fighting
for
his
own
hand
and
striving
for
victory
in
the
face
of
death
everywhere
in
the
wars
of
more
than
in
any
other
age
personality
dominates
all
else
the
effect
of
mass
tactics
has
abolished
all
close
formations
of
infantry
and
the
individual
is
left
to
himself
the
direct
influence
of
the
superior
has
lessened
in
the
strategic
duties
of
the
cavalry
which
represent
the
chief
activity
of
that
arm
the
patrol
riders
and
orderlies
are
separated
more
than
before
from
their
troop
and
are
left
to
their
own
responsibility
even
in
the
artillery
the
importance
of
independent
action
will
be
more
clearly
emphasized
than
previously
the
battlefields
and
area
of
operations
have
increased
with
the
masses
employed
the
is
far
less
able
than
ever
before
to
superintend
operations
in
various
parts
of
the
field
he
is
forced
to
allow
a
greater
latitude
to
his
subordinates
these
conditions
are
very
prominent
in
attacking
operations
when
on
the
defensive
the
duty
of
the
individual
is
mainly
to
hold
his
ground
while
the
commander
principal
business
is
to
utilize
the
reserves
on
the
offensive
however
the
conditions
change
from
moment
to
moment
according
to
the
of
the
enemy
which
can
not
be
anticipated
and
the
success
or
failure
of
the
attacking
troops
even
the
individual
soldier
as
the
fight
fluctuates
must
now
push
on
now
wait
patiently
until
the
reinforcements
have
come
up
he
will
often
have
to
choose
for
himself
the
objects
at
which
to
fire
while
never
losing
touch
with
the
main
body
the
offensive
makes
very
varied
calls
on
the
commander
qualities
ruse
and
strategy
boldness
and
unsparing
energy
deliberate
judgment
and
rapid
decision
are
alternately
demanded
from
him
he
must
be
competent
to
perform
the
most
opposite
duties
all
this
puts
a
heavy
strain
on
personality
it
is
evident
then
that
the
army
which
contains
the
greatest
number
of
and
independent
personalities
must
have
a
distinct
advantage
this
object
therefore
we
must
strive
with
every
nerve
to
attain
to
be
superior
in
this
respect
to
all
our
enemies
and
this
object
can
be
attained
personality
can
be
developed
especially
in
the
sphere
of
spiritual
activity
the
reflective
and
critical
powers
can
be
improved
by
continuous
exercise
but
the
man
who
can
estimate
the
conditions
under
which
he
has
to
act
who
is
master
of
the
element
in
which
he
has
to
work
will
certainly
make
up
his
mind
more
rapidly
and
more
easily
than
a
man
who
faces
a
situation
which
he
does
not
grasp
boldness
and
imperturbability
in
the
hour
of
misfortune
are
produced
by
knowledge
this
is
shown
everywhere
we
see
the
awkward
and
shy
recruit
ripen
into
a
smart
sergeant
and
the
same
process
is
often
traced
among
the
higher
commands
but
where
the
mental
development
is
insufficient
for
the
problems
which
are
to
be
solved
the
personality
fails
at
the
moment
of
action
the
elegant
guardsman
bourbaki
collapsed
when
he
saw
himself
confronted
with
the
task
of
leading
an
army
whose
conditions
he
did
not
thoroughly
grasp
general
chanzy
on
the
other
hand
retained
his
clear
judgment
and
resolute
determination
in
the
midst
of
defeat
thus
one
of
the
essential
tasks
of
the
preparations
for
war
is
to
raise
the
spiritual
level
of
the
army
and
thus
indirectly
to
mould
and
elevate
character
especially
is
it
essential
to
develop
the
and
resourcefulness
of
those
in
high
command
in
a
long
military
life
ideas
all
too
early
grow
stereotyped
and
the
old
soldier
follows
traditional
trains
of
thought
and
can
no
longer
form
an
unprejudiced
opinion
the
danger
of
such
development
can
not
be
shut
out
the
stiff
and
uniform
composition
of
the
army
which
doubles
its
moral
powers
has
this
defect
it
often
leads
to
a
development
quite
at
variance
with
the
of
actual
realities
and
arrests
the
growth
of
personality
something
akin
to
this
was
seen
in
germany
in
the
tentative
scheme
of
an
attack
united
will
and
action
are
essential
to
give
force
its
greatest
value
they
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
greatest
spiritual
independence
and
resourcefulness
capable
of
meeting
any
emergency
and
solving
new
problems
by
original
methods
it
has
often
been
said
that
one
man
is
as
good
as
another
that
personality
is
nothing
the
type
is
everything
but
this
assertion
is
erroneous
in
time
of
peace
when
sham
reputations
flourish
and
no
real
struggle
winnows
the
chaff
from
the
coin
mediocrity
in
performance
is
enough
but
in
war
personality
turns
the
scale
responsibility
and
danger
bring
out
personality
and
show
its
real
worth
as
surely
as
a
chemical
test
separates
the
pure
metal
from
the
dross
that
army
is
fortunate
which
has
placed
men
of
this
kind
in
the
important
posts
during
and
has
kept
them
there
this
is
the
only
way
to
avoid
the
dangers
which
a
routine
produces
and
to
break
down
that
which
is
so
prejudicial
to
progress
and
success
it
redounds
to
the
lasting
credit
of
william
that
for
the
highest
and
most
responsible
posts
at
any
rate
he
had
already
in
time
of
peace
made
his
selection
from
among
all
the
apparently
great
men
around
him
and
that
he
chose
and
upheld
in
the
teeth
of
all
opposition
those
who
showed
themselves
heroes
and
men
of
action
in
the
hour
of
need
and
had
the
courage
to
keep
to
their
own
paths
this
is
no
slight
title
to
fame
for
as
a
rule
the
unusual
rouses
envy
and
distrust
but
the
cheap
average
wisdom
which
never
prompted
action
appears
as
a
refined
superiority
and
it
is
only
under
the
pressure
of
the
stern
reality
of
war
that
the
truth
of
goethe
lines
is
proved
folk
and
thrall
and

chapter
x
army
organization
i
now
turn
to
the
discussion
of
some
questions
of
organization
but
it
is
not
my
intention
to
ventilate
all
the
needs
and
aims
connected
with
this
subject
that
occupy
our
military
circles
at
the
present
time
i
shall
rather
endeavour
to
work
out
the
general
considerations
which
in
my
opinion
must
determine
the
further
development
of
our
army
if
we
wish
by
consistent
energy
to
attain
a
superiority
in
the
directions
which
will
certainly
prove
to
be
in
the
next
war
it
will
be
necessary
to
go
into
details
only
on
points
which
are
especially
noteworthy
or
require
some
explanation
i
shall
obviously
come
into
opposition
with
the
existing
state
of
things
but
nothing
is
further
from
my
purpose
than
to
criticize
them
my
views
are
based
on
theoretical
requirements
while
our
army
from
certain
definitely
presented
beginnings
and
under
the
influence
of
most
different
men
and
of
changing
views
in
the
midst
of
financial
difficulties
and
political
disputes
has
by
fits
and
starts
grown
up
into
what
it
now
is
it
is
in
a
certain
sense
outside
criticism
it
must
be
taken
as
something
already
existing
whose
origin
is
only
a
subject
for
a
subsequent
historical
verdict
but
the
further
expansion
of
our
army
belongs
to
the
future
and
its
course
can
be
directed
it
can
follow
lines
in
order
to
become
efficient
and
it
is
politically
most
important
that
this
object
should
be
realized
therefore
i
shall
not
look
back
critically
on
the
past
but
shall
try
to
serve
the
future
the
guiding
principle
of
our
preparations
for
war
must
be
as
i
have
already
said
the
development
of
the
greatest
fighting
strength
and
the
greatest
tactical
efficiency
in
order
through
them
to
be
in
a
position
to
carry
on
an
offensive
war
successfully
what
follows
will
therefore
fall
naturally
under
these
two
heads
fighting
strength
rests
partly
as
already
said
on
the
training
which
will
be
discussed
later
the
arming
and
the
partly
on
the
composition
of
the
troops
and
therefore
in
the
case
of
line
regiments
with
which
we
chiefly
have
to
deal
since
they
are
the
real
field
troops
on
the
strength
of
their
peace
establishment
it
was
shown
in
the
previous
chapter
how
essential
it
is
to
have
in
the
standing
army
not
only
the
necessary
cadres
ready
for
the
new
formations
but
to
make
the
separate
branches
so
strong
that
they
can
easily
be
brought
up
to
full
strength
in
the
efficiency
and
character
of
the
superiors
the
officers
and
the
officers
are
equally
weighty
factors
in
the
value
of
the
troops
they
are
the
professional
supporters
of
discipline
decision
and
initiative
and
since
they
are
the
teachers
of
the
troops
they
determine
their
intellectual
standard
the
number
of
permanent
officers
on
the
establishment
in
peace
is
exceedingly
small
in
proportion
to
their
duties
in
the
training
of
the
troops
and
to
the
demands
made
of
them
on
mobilization
if
we
reflect
how
many
officers
and
officers
from
the
standing
army
must
be
transferred
to
the
new
formations
in
order
to
vitalize
them
and
how
the
modern
tactical
forms
make
it
difficult
for
the
superior
officer
to
assert
his
influence
in
battle
the
numerical
inadequacy
of
the
existing
is
clearly
demonstrated
this
applies
mainly
to
the
infantry
and
in
their
case
since
they
are
the
decisive
arm
a
sufficient
number
of
efficient
officers
is
essential
all
the
more
important
is
it
on
the
one
hand
to
keep
the
establishment
of
officers
and
officers
in
the
infantry
at
full
strength
and
on
the
other
hand
to
raise
the
efficiency
of
the
officers
and
officers
on
leave
or
in
the
reserve
this
latter
is
a
question
of
training
and
does
not
come
into
the
present
discussion
the
task
of
keeping
the
establishments
at
adequate
strength
is
in
a
sense
a
financial
question
the
amount
of
the
pay
and
the
prospects
which
the
profession
holds
out
for
subsequent
civil
posts
greatly
affect
the
body
of
officers
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
keep
step
with
the
general
increase
in
prices
by
improved
pecuniary
advantages
even
for
the
building
up
of
the
corps
of
officers
the
financial
question
is
the
career
of
the
officer
offers
so
little
prospect
of
success
and
exacts
such
efficiency
and
from
the
individual
that
he
will
not
long
remain
in
the
service
attractive
as
it
is
if
the
financial
sacrifices
are
so
high
as
they
now
are
the
infantry
officer
especially
must
have
a
better
position
granted
that
the
cavalry
and
mounted
artillery
officers
incur
greater
expenses
for
the
keep
of
their
horses
than
the
infantry
officer
has
to
pay
the
military
duties
of
the
latter
are
by
far
the
most
strenuous
and
require
a
very
considerable
outlay
on
clothing
it
would
be
in
my
opinion
expedient
to
give
the
infantry
officer
more
pay
than
the
cavalry
and
artillery
officers
in
order
to
make
service
in
that
arm
more
attractive
there
is
a
rush
nowadays
into
the
mounted
arm
for
which
there
is
a
plethora
of
candidates
these
arms
will
always
be
well
supplied
with
officers
their
greater
attractiveness
must
be
counterbalanced
by
special
advantages
offered
by
the
infantry
service
by
no
other
means
can
we
be
sure
of
having
sufficient
officers
in
the
chief
arm
if
the
fighting
strength
in
each
detachment
depends
on
its
composition
and
training
there
are
other
elements
besides
the
tactical
value
of
the
troops
which
determine
the
effectiveness
of
their
combined
efforts
in
action
these
are
first
the
leadership
which
however
depends
on
conditions
which
are
beyond
calculation
and
secondly
the
numerical
proportion
of
the
arms
to
each
other
disregarding
provisionally
the
cavalry
who
play
a
special
role
in
battle
we
must
define
the
proportion
which
artillery
must
bear
to
infantry
with
regard
to
machine
guns
the
idea
that
they
can
to
some
extent
replace
infantry
is
quite
erroneous
machine
guns
are
primarily
weapons
of
defence
in
attack
they
can
only
be
employed
under
very
favourable
conditions
and
then
strengthen
only
one
factor
of
a
successful
attack
the
while
they
may
sometimes
hinder
that
impetuous
forward
rush
which
is
the
soul
of
every
attack
hence
this
auxiliary
weapon
should
be
given
to
the
infantry
in
limited
numbers
and
employed
mainly
on
the
defensive
fronts
and
should
be
often
massed
into
large
units
detachments
should
not
overburden
the
marching
columns
the
relation
of
infantry
to
artillery
is
of
more
importance
infantry
is
the
decisive
arm
other
arms
are
exclusively
there
to
smooth
their
road
to
victory
and
support
their
action
directly
or
indirectly
this
relation
must
not
be
merely
theoretical
the
needs
of
the
infantry
must
ultimately
determine
the
importance
of
all
other
fighting
instruments
in
the
whole
army
if
we
make
this
idea
the
basis
of
our
argument
the
following
is
the
result
infantry
has
gained
enormously
in
defensive
power
owing
to
modern
weapons
the
attack
requires
therefore
a
far
greater
superiority
than
ever
before
in
addition
to
this
the
breadth
of
front
in
action
has
greatly
increased
in
consequence
of
the
former
close
tactical
formations
having
been
broken
up
through
the
increase
of
fire
this
refers
only
to
the
separate
detachment
and
does
not
justify
the
conclusion
that
in
the
future
fewer
troops
will
cover
the
same
spaces
as
before
this
assumption
applies
at
the
most
to
defence
and
then
only
in
a
limited
sense
in
attack
the
opposite
will
probably
be
the
case
the
troops
must
therefore
be
placed
more
deeply
échelon
in
the
last
wars
now
the
average
breadth
of
the
front
in
attack
must
regulate
the
allotment
of
artillery
to
infantry
no
definite
proportion
can
be
settled
but
if
the
theoretical
calculation
be
compared
with
the
experiences
of
the
last
wars
conclusions
may
be
obtained
which
will
most
probably
prove
appropriate
no
more
than
this
can
be
expected
in
the
domain
of
military
science
if
we
agree
to
the
proportion
of
breadth
and
depth
in
an
infantry
attack
we
shall
be
driven
to
insist
on
a
reduction
of
artillery
as
compared
with
the
past
but
should
we
think
that
modern
artillery
helps
the
attack
especially
by
indirect
fire
we
must
advocate
from
the
standpoint
of
offensive
warfare
an
increase
of
the
artillery
actual
war
experiences
alone
can
find
the
true
middle
path
between
these
two
extremes
if
the
frontal
development
of
the
artillery
of
a
modern
army
corps
or
better
still
two
divisions
be
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
that
the
guns
can
not
advance
in
connected
line
but
that
only
the
specially
adapted
parts
of
the
field
can
be
used
for
artillery
development
the
conclusion
is
certain
that
by
such
frontal
extension
the
infantry
is
reduced
to
a
covering
line
for
the
artillery
in
forming
this
opinion
we
must
not
assume
the
normal
strength
of
the
infantry
but
take
into
account
that
the
strength
of
the
infantry
in
war
rapidly
melts
away
if
we
estimate
the
companies
on
the
average
at
of
their
proper
strength
we
shall
be
above
rather
than
below
the
real
figures
such
infantry
strength
will
of
course
be
sufficient
to
defend
the
position
taken
up
by
the
artillery
but
it
is
hardly
enough
to
carry
out
in
that
section
of
the
field
a
decisive
attack
which
under
present
conditions
requires
greater
numbers
and
depth
than
before
in
this
connection
it
is
very
instructive
to
study
the
second
part
of
the
war
and
the
boer
war
as
well
as
the
manchurian
campaign
some
of
the
german
infantry
had
in
the
period
extraordinarily
diminished
in
numbers
companies
of
men
were
not
rare
the
artillery
on
the
contrary
had
remained
at
its
original
strength
the
consequences
naturally
was
that
the
powers
of
the
germans
on
the
offensive
grew
less
and
the
battles
and
skirmishes
were
not
so
decisive
as
in
the
first
part
of
the
war
this
condition
would
have
shown
up
more
distinctly
against
an
enemy
of
equal
class
than
in
the
contest
with
the
raw
french
levies
in
the
former
case
the
offensive
would
have
been
impracticable
the
strong
artillery
under
the
existing
conditions
no
doubt
gave
great
support
to
the
weak
infantry
but
an
unbiassed
opinion
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
under
the
then
existing
proportion
of
the
arms
to
each
other
the
infantry
was
too
weak
to
adopt
energetic
offensive
tactics
against
a
enemy
this
is
irresistibly
proved
if
we
consider
what
masses
of
infantry
were
needed
at
wörth
and
privat
for
instance
in
spite
of
the
support
of
very
superior
artillery
in
order
to
defeat
a
weaker
enemy
of
equal
class
again
in
south
africa
the
overwhelming
superiority
of
the
english
in
artillery
was
never
able
to
force
a
victory
in
manchuria
the
state
of
things
was
very
instructive
numerically
the
russian
artillery
was
extraordinarily
superior
to
the
enemy
and
the
range
of
the
russian
field
guns
was
longer
than
that
of
the
japanese
nevertheless
the
japanese
succeeded
in
beating
an
enemy
stronger
in
infantry
also
because
in
the
decisive
directions
of
attack
they
were
able
to
unite
superior
forces
of
infantry
and
artillery
while
the
russian
artillery
was
scattered
along
the
whole
of
their
broad
front
the
lesson
of
this
war
is
that
apart
from
the
close
relation
of
the
arms
to
each
other
in
the
separate
units
the
of
these
units
must
be
looked
at
if
the
strength
of
the
two
sister
arms
is
to
be
appropriately
determined
the
requirement
that
each
separate
tactical
unit
should
he
made
equal
or
superior
in
artillery
to
the
corresponding
hostile
unit
is
thoroughly
mechanical
as
if
in
war
division
always
fought
against
division
and
corps
against
corps
superiority
at
the
decisive
point
is
the
crucial
test
this
superiority
is
attained
by
means
of
an
unexpected
concentration
of
forces
for
attack
and
there
is
no
reason
why
the
superiority
in
artillery
should
not
also
be
brought
about
in
this
way
if
by
superior
tactical
skill
two
army
corps
each
with
guns
combine
against
a
hostile
army
which
brings
guns
into
action
that
signifies
a
superiority
of
guns
and
a
double
superiority
in
infantry
if
it
is
assumed
that
on
both
sides
the
army
corps
is
armed
with
guns
and
that
in
consequence
of
this
the
tactical
superiority
has
become
so
slight
that
neither
side
can
claim
a
superiority
in
one
direction
then
equal
forces
meet
and
chance
decides
the
day
since
the
japanese
were
tactically
more
efficient
than
their
enemy
and
took
the
offensive
they
were
enabled
to
unite
the
superior
forces
in
the
most
decisive
directions
and
this
advantage
proved
far
greater
than
the
numerical
superiority
of
the
russian
army
as
a
whole
if
we
look
at
the
whole
matter
we
shall
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
artillery
if
it
is
not
a
question
of
pure
defence
need
never
occupy
within
a
line
of
battle
so
much
ground
that
the
concentration
of
a
considerably
superior
force
of
infantry
for
attack
is
rendered
doubtful
in
this
respect
we
have
in
our
present
organization
already
exceeded
the
expedient
proportion
between
the
two
arms
in
favour
of
the
artillery
the
conclusion
is
that
this
latter
arm
never
need
within
the
separate
divisions
be
made
so
strong
that
the
attacking
capacities
of
the
army
are
thereby
prejudiced
this
is
the
decisive
point
any
excess
in
artillery
can
be
kept
on
the
battlefield
in
reserve
when
space
is
restricted
if
the
attacking
efficiency
of
the
troops
is
reduced
then
artillery
becomes
a
dead
weight
on
the
army
instead
of
an
aid
to
victory
it
is
far
more
important
to
be
able
to
unite
superior
forces
for
a
decisive
attack
than
to
meet
the
enemy
with
equally
matched
forces
along
the
whole
front
if
we
observe
this
principle
we
shall
often
be
weaker
than
the
enemy
on
the
less
important
fronts
this
disadvantage
may
be
partly
counterbalanced
by
remaining
on
the
defensive
in
such
a
position
it
becomes
a
positive
advantage
if
owing
to
an
overpowering
concentration
of
forces
victory
is
won
at
the
decisive
point
this
victory
cancels
all
the
failures
which
may
have
been
recorded
elsewhere
the
operative
superiority
of
an
enemy
is
determined
by
the
greater
marching
capacity
of
the
troops
by
the
rapid
and
systematic
working
of
the
communications
with
the
rear
and
above
all
by
the
length
of
the
columns
of
the
operating
troops
under
the
modern
system
of
colossal
armaments
an
army
especially
if
in
close
formation
can
not
possibly
live
on
the
country
it
is
driven
to
trust
to
daily
from
the
rear
railways
are
used
as
far
as
possible
to
bring
up
the
supplies
but
from
the
railhead
the
communication
with
the
troops
must
be
maintained
by
columns
of
traction
waggons
and
draught
animals
which
go
to
and
fro
between
the
troops
the
rearward
magazines
and
the
railhead
since
traction
waggons
are
restricted
to
made
roads
the
direct
communication
with
the
troops
must
be
kept
up
by
columns
of
draught
animals
which
can
move
independently
of
the
roads
the
waggons
of
provisions
therefore
which
follow
the
troops
and
are
filled
daily
must
come
up
with
them
the
same
day
or
there
will
be
a
shortage
of
food
this
is
only
possible
if
the
troop
column
does
not
exceed
a
certain
length
and
starts
at
early
morning
so
that
the
transport
waggons
which
at
the
end
of
the
march
must
be
driven
from
the
rear
to
the
head
of
the
column
can
reach
this
before
the
beginning
of
the
night
rest
the
fitness
of
an
army
for
attack
can
only
be
maintained
if
these
supplies
are
uninterrupted
there
must
also
be
a
sufficient
quantity
of
tinned
rations
and
provisions
which
the
soldiers
can
carry
with
them
if
the
length
of
the
columns
exceeds
the
limit
here
laid
down
the
marches
must
be
proportionately
shortened
if
unusually
lengthy
marches
are
made
so
that
the
provision
carts
can
not
reach
the
troops
days
of
rest
must
be
interposed
to
regulate
the
supply
thus
the
capacity
of
an
army
to
march
and
to
carry
out
operations
is
directly
dependent
on
the
possibility
of
being
fed
from
the
rear
a
careful
calculation
based
on
practical
experiences
shows
that
in
order
to
average
to
kilometres
a
day
the
minimum
distance
required
from
an
army
no
column
on
a
road
ought
to
exceed
a
length
of
about
kilometres
this
consideration
determines
the
depth
of
the
army
corps
on
the
march
since
in
an
important
campaign
and
when
massing
for
battle
troops
seldom
march
in
smaller
bodies
than
a
corps
this
calculation
by
which
the
conditions
of
modern
war
are
compulsorily
affected
makes
it
highly
necessary
that
the
system
of
supplies
and
rations
should
be
carefully
organized
the
restoration
of
any
destroyed
railways
the
construction
of
light
railways
the
organization
of
columns
of
motor
transport
waggons
and
draught
animals
must
be
prepared
by
every
conceivable
means
in
time
of
peace
in
order
that
in
the
railroads
may
follow
as
closely
as
possible
on
the
track
of
the
troops
and
that
the
columns
may
maintain
without
interruption
continuous
communications
between
the
troops
and
the
railhead
in
order
to
keep
this
machinery
permanently
in
working
order
and
to
surmount
any
crisis
in
bringing
up
supplies
it
is
highly
advisable
to
have
an
ample
stock
of
tinned
rations
this
stock
should
in
consideration
of
the
necessary
be
as
large
as
possible
care
must
be
taken
by
the
organization
of
trains
and
columns
that
the
stock
of
tinned
provisions
can
be
quickly
renewed
this
would
be
best
done
by
special
light
columns
which
are
attached
to
the
army
corps
outside
the
organization
of
provision
and
transport
columns
and
follow
it
at
such
a
distance
that
if
necessary
they
could
be
soon
pushed
to
the
front
by
forced
or
night
marches
there
is
naturally
some
reluctance
to
increase
the
trains
of
the
army
corps
but
this
necessity
is
unavoidable
it
is
further
to
be
observed
that
the
columns
in
question
would
not
be
very
long
since
they
would
mainly
convey
condensed
foods
and
other
provisions
compressed
into
the
smallest
space
an
immense
apparatus
of
train
formations
railway
and
telegraph
corps
and
workmen
must
be
got
ready
to
secure
the
efficiency
of
a
modern
army
with
its
millions
this
is
absolutely
necessary
since
without
it
the
troops
in
modern
warfare
would
be
practically
unable
to
move
it
is
far
more
important
to
be
ahead
of
the
enemy
in
this
respect
than
in
any
other
for
there
lies
the
possibility
of
massing
a
superior
force
at
the
decisive
point
and
of
thus
defeating
a
stronger
opponent
however
careful
the
preparations
these
advantages
can
only
be
attained
if
the
troop
columns
do
not
exceed
the
maximum
strength
which
can
be
fed
from
the
rear
if
the
necessary
forward
movement
is
carried
out
everything
which
an
army
corps
requires
for
the
war
must
be
kept
within
these
limits
our
modern
army
corps
without
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
field
army
corresponds
roughly
to
this
requirement
but
should
it
be
lengthened
by
a
heavy
howitzer
battalion
with
the
necessary
ammunition
columns
it
will
considerably
exceed
the
safe
marching
depth
if
that
is
the
necessary
distance
be
included
since
also
the
infantry
is
too
weak
in
proportion
to
the
space
required
by
the
artillery
to
deploy
it
becomes
advisable
in
the
interests
both
of
powerful
attack
and
of
operative
efficiency
within
the
separate
troop
organizations
to
strengthen
the
numbers
of
the
infantry
and
reduce
those
of
the
artillery
in
addition
to
the
length
of
the
column
the
arrangement
of
the
division
is
very
important
for
its
tactical
efficiency
this
must
be
such
as
to
permit
the
most
varied
employment
of
the
troops
and
the
formation
of
reserves
without
the
preliminary
necessity
of
breaking
up
all
the
units
this
requirement
does
not
at
all
correspond
to
our
traditional
organization
and
the
man
to
insist
upon
it
vigorously
has
not
yet
appeared
although
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
existing
tactical
organization
and
suitable
schemes
have
already
been
drawn
up
by
competent
officers
the
army
corps
is
divided
into
two
divisions
the
division
into
two
infantry
brigades
all
the
brigades
consist
of
two
regiments
the
formation
of
a
reserve
makes
it
very
difficult
for
the
commander
to
fix
the
centre
of
gravity
of
the
battle
according
to
circumstances
and
his
own
judgment
it
is
always
necessary
to
break
up
some
body
when
a
reserve
has
to
be
formed
and
in
most
cases
to
reduce
the
officers
of
some
detachment
to
inactivity
of
course
a
certain
centre
of
gravity
for
the
battle
may
be
obtained
by
assigning
to
one
part
of
the
troops
a
wider
and
to
the
other
a
narrower
space
for
deployment
but
this
procedure
in
no
way
replaces
a
reserve
for
it
is
not
always
possible
even
in
the
first
dispositions
for
the
engagement
to
judge
where
the
brunt
of
the
battle
will
be
that
depends
largely
on
the
measures
taken
by
the
enemy
and
the
course
of
the
battle
napoleon
saying
et
puis
je
vois
finds
its
application
though
to
a
lessened
extent
even
the
division
of
cavalry
brigades
into
two
regiments
is
simply
a
traditional
institution
which
has
been
thoughtlessly
perpetuated
it
has
not
been
realized
that
the
duties
of
the
cavalry
have
completely
changed
and
that
brigades
of
two
regiments
are
in
addition
to
other
disadvantages
too
weak
to
carry
these
duties
out
this
bisecting
system
by
restricting
the
freedom
of
action
contradicts
the
most
generally
accepted
military
principles
the
most
natural
formation
is
certainly
a
tripartition
of
the
units
as
is
found
in
an
infantry
regiment
this
system
permits
the
separate
divisions
to
fight
near
each
other
and
leaves
room
for
the
withdrawal
of
a
reserve
the
formation
of
a
detachment
or
the
employment
of
the
subdivisions
in
lines
treffen
for
the
principle
of
the
wing
attack
must
not
be
allowed
to
remain
merely
a
scheme
finally
it
is
the
best
formation
for
the
offensive
since
it
allows
the
main
body
of
the
troops
to
be
employed
at
a
single
point
in
order
to
obtain
a
decisive
result
there
a
special
difficulty
in
the
free
handling
of
the
troops
is
produced
by
the
quite
mechanical
division
of
the
artillery
who
bring
into
action
two
kinds
of
ordnance
cannons
and
howitzers
these
latter
can
of
course
be
used
as
cannons
but
have
special
functions
which
are
not
always
required
their
place
in
the
organization
however
is
precisely
the
same
as
that
of
the
cannons
and
it
is
thus
very
difficult
to
employ
them
as
their
particular
character
demands
the
object
in
the
whole
of
this
organization
has
been
to
make
corps
and
divisions
equal
and
if
possible
superior
to
the
corresponding
formations
of
the
enemy
by
distributing
the
batteries
proportionately
according
to
numbers
among
the
divisions
this
secured
besides
the
undeniable
advantage
of
placing
the
artillery
directly
under
the
orders
of
the
commanders
of
the
troops
but
in
return
it
robbed
the
commanding
general
of
the
last
means
secured
by
the
organization
of
enforcing
his
tactical
aims
he
is
now
forced
to
form
a
reserve
for
himself
out
of
the
artillery
of
the
division
and
thus
to
deprive
one
division
at
least
of
half
its
artillery
if
he
has
the
natural
desire
to
withdraw
for
himself
the
howitzer
section
which
is
found
in
one
division
only
the
same
division
must
always
be
subjected
to
this
reduction
of
its
strength
and
it
is
more
than
problematical
whether
this
result
always
fits
in
with
the
tactical
position
it
seems
at
least
worth
while
considering
whether
under
these
circumstances
it
would
not
be
a
more
appropriate
arrangement
to
attach
a
howitzer
section
to
each
division
the
distribution
of
the
heavy
field
howitzers
is
another
momentous
question
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
principles
that
guide
the
whole
army
to
divide
them
equally
among
the
army
corps
this
arrangement
would
have
much
in
its
favour
for
every
corps
may
find
itself
in
a
position
where
heavy
howitzer
batteries
can
be
profitably
employed
they
can
also
however
be
combined
under
the
command
of
the
and
attached
to
the
second
line
of
the
army
the
first
arrangement
offers
as
has
been
said
many
advantages
but
entails
the
great
disadvantage
that
the
line
of
march
of
the
army
corps
is
dangerously
lengthened
by
several
kilometres
so
that
no
course
is
left
but
either
to
weaken
the
other
troops
of
the
corps
or
to
sacrifice
the
indispensable
property
of
tactical
efficiency
both
alternatives
are
inadmissible
on
the
other
hand
since
the
employment
of
heavy
howitzers
is
by
no
means
necessary
in
every
engagement
but
only
when
an
attack
is
planned
against
a
enemy
it
may
be
safely
assumed
that
the
heavy
howitzers
could
be
brought
up
in
time
out
of
the
second
line
by
a
night
march
besides
their
mobility
renders
it
possible
to
detach
single
batteries
or
sections
and
on
emergency
to
attach
them
to
an
army
corps
temporarily
there
is
a
prevalent
notion
that
the
heavy
howitzers
are
principally
used
to
fight
the
enemy
field
artillery
and
therefore
must
be
on
the
spot
in
every
engagement
they
have
even
been
known
to
stray
into
the
advance
guard
i
do
not
approve
of
this
idea
the
enemy
field
artillery
will
fire
indirectly
from
previously
masked
positions
and
in
such
case
they
can
not
be
very
successfully
attacked
by
heavy
howitzers
it
seems
to
me
quite
unjustifiable
with
the
view
of
attaining
this
problematic
object
to
burden
the
marching
columns
permanently
with
long
unwieldy
trains
of
artillery
and
ammunition
and
thus
to
render
their
effectiveness
doubtful
no
doubt
the
japanese
who
throughout
the
war
continually
increased
their
heavy
field
howitzers
ultimately
attached
artillery
of
that
sort
to
every
division
the
experiences
of
that
war
must
not
however
be
overestimated
or
generalized
the
conditions
were
quite
the
japanese
fought
on
their
whole
front
against
fortified
positions
strengthened
by
heavy
artillery
and
as
they
attacked
the
enemy
line
in
its
whole
extension
they
required
on
their
side
equally
heavy
guns
it
should
be
noticed
that
they
did
not
distribute
their
very
effective
field
howitzers
along
the
whole
front
but
so
far
as
i
can
gather
assigned
them
all
to
the
army
of
general
nogi
whose
duty
was
to
carry
out
the
decisive
enveloping
movement
at
mukden
the
japanese
thus
felt
the
need
of
concentrating
the
effect
of
their
howitzers
and
as
we
hope
we
shall
not
imitate
their
frontal
attack
but
break
through
the
enemy
front
though
in
a
different
way
from
theirs
the
question
of
concentration
seems
to
me
very
important
for
us
under
these
circumstances
it
will
be
most
advantageous
to
unite
the
heavy
batteries
in
the
hand
of
the
they
thus
best
serve
his
scheme
of
offence
he
can
mass
them
at
the
place
which
he
wishes
to
make
the
decisive
point
in
the
battle
and
will
thus
attain
that
end
most
completely
whereas
the
distribution
of
them
among
the
army
corps
only
dissipates
their
effectiveness
his
heavy
batteries
will
be
for
him
what
the
artillery
reserves
are
for
the
divisional
general
there
where
their
mighty
voice
roars
over
the
battlefield
will
be
the
deciding
struggle
of
the
day
every
man
down
to
the
last
private
knows
that
i
will
only
mention
incidentally
that
the
present
organization
of
the
heavy
artillery
on
a
peace
footing
is
unsatisfactory
the
batteries
which
in
war
are
assigned
to
the
field
army
must
in
peace
also
be
placed
under
the
orders
of
the
corps
commanders
truppenführer
if
they
are
to
become
an
organic
part
of
the
whole
at
present
the
heavy
artillery
of
the
field
army
is
placed
under
the
of
the
foot
artillery
and
attached
to
the
troops
only
for
purposes
of
manoeuvres
it
thus
remains
an
isolated
organism
so
far
as
the
army
goes
and
does
not
feel
itself
an
integral
part
of
the
whole
a
clear
distinction
between
field
artillery
and
fortress
artillery
would
be
more
practical
this
view
seems
at
first
sight
to
contradict
the
requirement
that
the
heavy
batteries
should
form
a
reserve
in
the
hands
of
the
as
the
armies
do
not
exist
in
and
manoeuvres
are
seldom
carried
out
in
army
formation
the
result
of
the
present
organization
is
that
the
tactical
relations
of
the
heavy
artillery
and
the
other
troops
are
not
sufficiently
understood
this
disadvantage
would
be
removed
if
heavy
artillery
were
assigned
permanently
to
each
army
corps
this
would
not
prevent
it
being
united
in
in
the
hands
of
the
army
leaders
on
the
contrary
they
would
be
used
in
manoeuvres
in
relation
to
the
army
corps
in
precisely
the
same
sense
as
they
would
be
in
in
relation
to
the
armies
the
operations
of
the
army
in
the
enemy
countries
will
be
far
more
effective
if
it
has
control
of
the
railways
and
roads
that
implies
not
merely
the
restoration
of
railroads
that
may
have
been
destroyed
but
the
rapid
capture
of
the
barrier
forts
and
fortresses
which
impede
the
advance
of
the
army
by
cutting
off
the
railway
communications
we
were
taught
the
lesson
in
in
france
how
far
defective
railway
communications
hindered
all
operations
it
is
therefore
of
vital
importance
that
a
corps
should
be
available
whose
main
duty
is
the
discharge
of
these
necessary
functions
until
recently
we
had
only
one
united
corps
of
pioneers
which
was
organized
alike
for
operations
in
the
field
and
for
siege
operations
but
these
latter
have
recently
been
so
much
developed
that
that
system
can
no
longer
supply
an
adequate
technical
training
for
them
the
demands
made
by
this
department
of
warfare
on
the
one
hand
and
by
the
duties
of
pioneering
in
the
field
on
the
other
are
so
extensive
and
so
essentially
different
that
it
seems
quite
impracticable
to
train
adequately
one
and
the
same
corps
in
both
branches
during
two
service
the
chief
functions
of
the
field
pioneer
are
fortifying
positions
and
supporting
the
infantry
in
the
attack
on
fortified
places
the
most
important
part
of
the
fortress
duties
consists
in
sapping
and
above
all
in
mining
in
preparing
for
the
storming
of
permanent
works
and
in
supporting
the
infantry
in
the
actual
storm
the
army
can
not
be
satisfied
with
a
superficial
training
for
such
service
it
demands
a
most
thorough
going
previous
preparation
starting
from
this
point
of
view
general
beseler
the
late
of
fortresses
and
pioneers
who
has
done
inestimable
service
to
his
country
laid
the
foundations
of
a
new
organization
this
follows
the
idea
of
the
field
pioneers
and
the
fortress
pioneers
a
rudimentary
training
in
common
followed
by
separate
special
training
for
their
special
duties
we
must
continue
on
these
lines
and
develop
more
particularly
the
fortress
pioneer
branch
of
the
service
in
better
proportion
to
its
value
in
connection
with
the
requirements
already
discussed
which
are
directly
concerned
with
securing
and
maintaining
an
increase
of
tactical
efficiency
we
must
finally
mention
two
organizations
which
indirectly
serve
the
same
purpose
these
diminish
the
tactical
efficiency
of
the
enemy
and
so
increase
our
own
while
by
reconnoitring
and
by
screening
movements
they
help
the
attack
and
make
it
possible
to
take
the
enemy
unawares
an
important
condition
of
successful
offensive
warfare
i
refer
to
the
cavalry
and
the
the
cavalry
duties
are
twofold
on
the
one
hand
they
must
carry
out
reconnaissances
and
screening
movements
on
the
other
hand
they
must
operate
against
the
enemy
communications
continually
interrupt
the
regular
renewal
of
his
supplies
and
thus
cripple
his
mobility
every
military
expert
will
admit
that
our
cavalry
in
proportion
to
the
of
the
army
and
in
view
of
the
responsible
duties
assigned
them
in
war
is
lamentably
weak
this
disproportion
is
clearly
seen
if
we
look
at
the
probable
wastage
on
the
march
and
in
action
and
realize
that
it
is
virtually
impossible
to
replace
these
losses
adequately
and
that
formations
of
cavalry
reserves
can
only
possess
a
very
limited
efficiency
popular
opinion
considers
cavalry
more
or
less
superfluous
because
in
our
last
wars
they
certainly
achieved
comparatively
little
from
the
tactical
point
of
view
and
because
they
cost
a
great
deal
there
is
a
general
tendency
to
judge
cavalry
by
the
standard
of
and
it
can
not
be
emphasized
too
strongly
that
this
standard
is
misleading
on
the
one
hand
the
equipment
was
then
so
defective
that
it
crippled
the
powers
of
the
mounted
man
in
the
most
important
points
on
the
other
hand
the
employment
of
the
cavalry
was
conducted
on
a
wholly
antiquated
system
it
was
consequently
not
armed
for
independent
movements
what
they
then
did
must
not
be
compared
with
what
will
be
required
from
them
in
the
future
in
wars
in
which
mounted
forces
were
really
effective
and
not
hampered
in
their
movements
by
preconceived
notions
as
in
the
american
war
of
secession
and
the
boer
war
their
employment
has
been
continuously
extended
since
the
great
value
of
their
operative
mobility
was
convincingly
shown
especially
in
africa
notwithstanding
all
modern
weapons
these
are
the
wars
which
must
be
studied
in
order
to
form
a
fair
opinion
they
will
convince
us
that
an
increase
of
our
cavalry
is
absolutely
imperative
it
will
of
course
only
be
valuable
when
the
divisions
of
the
army
cavalry
are
equipped
with
columns
and
trains
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
operate
independently
the
effectiveness
of
the
cavalry
depends
entirely
on
the
fulfilment
of
this
condition
it
is
also
imperatively
necessary
when
the
measures
of
our
opponents
are
considered
to
strengthen
the
fighting
force
of
the
cavalry
by
an
adequate
addition
of
cyclist
sections
this
is
the
more
requisite
as
on
the
one
hand
the
attack
on
the
communications
must
expect
vigorous
opposition
and
on
the
other
hand
the
screening
duties
which
are
even
more
important
for
the
offensive
than
the
reconnaissances
are
likely
to
be
specially
successful
if
cavalry
and
cyclists
combine
again
an
increased
strength
of
cavalry
is
undeniably
required
to
meet
the
reconnoitring
and
screening
troops
of
the
enemy
besides
the
strengthening
of
this
arm
and
the
addition
of
cyclists
another
organization
is
required
if
the
cavalry
are
to
do
useful
service
brigades
of
two
regiments
and
divisions
of
six
regiments
are
in
where
all
depends
on
decisive
action
far
too
small
as
i
have
repeatedly
demonstrated
without
being
refuted
the
brigades
must
in
war
be
three
regiments
strong
the
strength
of
the
divisions
and
corps
may
vary
according
to
the
requirements
of
the
time
being
just
because
our
cavalry
is
so
weak
the
organization
must
be
in
a
high
degree
elastic
there
can
besides
be
no
doubt
on
the
point
that
the
side
which
commands
the
services
of
the
stronger
cavalry
led
on
modern
lines
will
have
at
the
outset
quite
inestimable
advantage
over
the
enemy
which
must
make
itself
felt
in
the
ultimate
issue
i
might
remark
incidentally
that
the
mounted
batteries
which
are
attached
to
the
army
cavalry
must
be
formed
with
four
guns
each
so
that
the
division
with
its
three
parts
would
have
the
control
of
three
batteries
and
if
necessary
a
battery
could
be
assigned
to
each
brigade
that
is
an
old
suggestion
which
the
emperor
william
once
made
but
it
has
never
yet
been
considered
it
is
not
with
cavalry
usually
a
question
of
protracted
artillery
engagements
but
of
utilizing
momentary
opportunities
the
greatest
mobility
is
required
together
with
the
most
efficiency
and
adaptability
there
can
obviously
therefore
be
no
question
of
a
systematic
combination
with
the
artillery
such
a
thing
can
only
be
of
value
in
the
case
of
cavalry
when
it
is
important
to
make
a
decisive
attack
the
reconnaissance
and
screening
duties
of
the
cavalry
must
be
completed
by
the
here
we
are
dealing
with
something
which
does
not
yet
exist
but
we
can
foresee
clearly
the
great
part
which
this
branch
of
military
science
will
play
in
future
wars
a
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
point
out
in
good
time
those
aspects
of
it
which
are
of
special
weight
in
a
military
sense
and
therefore
deserve
peculiar
consideration
from
the
technical
side
footnote
a
the
efficiency
and
success
of
the
italian
aviators
in
tripoli
are
noteworthy
but
must
not
be
overvalued
there
were
no
opponents
in
the
air
the
first
requirement
is
that
airships
in
addition
to
simplicity
of
handling
and
independence
of
weather
should
possess
a
superior
fighting
strength
for
it
is
impossible
effectively
to
screen
the
movements
of
the
army
and
to
open
the
road
for
reconnaissances
without
attacking
successfully
the
hostile
and
air
cruisers
the
power
to
fight
and
destroy
the
hostile
airships
must
be
the
leading
idea
in
all
constructions
and
the
tactics
to
be
pursued
must
be
at
once
thought
out
in
order
that
the
airships
may
be
built
accordingly
since
tactics
will
be
essentially
dependent
on
the
construction
and
the
technical
effectiveness
these
reciprocal
relations
must
be
borne
in
mind
from
the
first
so
as
to
gain
a
distinct
advantage
over
our
opponents
if
the
preceding
remarks
are
epitomized
we
have
apart
from
the
necessity
of
enforcing
universal
service
quite
a
long
list
of
proposed
changes
in
organization
the
adoption
of
which
will
considerably
improve
the
efficiency
of
our
army
the
whole
organization
must
be
such
that
the
column
length
of
the
army
corps
does
not
exceed
the
size
which
allows
a
rapid
advance
though
the
supplies
are
exclusively
drawn
from
magazine
depots
in
case
of
the
larger
formations
and
especially
of
the
army
corps
as
being
the
tactical
and
operative
unit
the
principle
of
tripartition
must
be
observed
the
infantry
must
be
in
proportion
to
the
artillery
substantially
strengthened
the
artillery
must
be
organized
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
possible
to
concentrate
the
fire
of
the
howitzers
where
required
without
breaking
up
the
units
the
cavalry
must
be
increased
strengthened
by
cyclist
sections
and
so
organized
as
to
insure
their
efficiency
in
war
the
formation
of
reinforcements
especially
for
supplies
must
be
so
elaborated
that
on
a
rapid
advance
an
efficient
system
of
feeding
the
troops
entirely
from
magazine
depots
can
be
maintained
the
must
be
energetically
developed
with
the
object
of
making
it
a
better
fighting
machine
than
that
of
the
enemy
finally
and
this
is
the
most
important
thing
we
must
strain
every
nerve
to
render
our
infantry
tactically
the
best
in
the
world
and
to
take
care
that
none
but
thoroughly
efficient
formations
are
employed
in
the
decisive
field
war
the
fulfilment
of
all
these
requirements
on
the
basis
of
our
present
organization
offers
naturally
great
difficulties
and
can
hardly
be
carried
out
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
a
german
reichstag
which
without
the
most
extreme
pressure
of
circumstances
could
resolve
to
make
for
the
army
the
sacrifices
called
for
by
our
political
condition
the
temptation
to
shut
the
eyes
to
existing
dangers
and
to
limit
political
aims
in
order
to
repudiate
the
need
of
great
sacrifices
is
so
strong
that
men
are
sure
to
succumb
to
it
especially
at
a
period
when
all
political
wisdom
seems
summed
up
in
the
maintenance
of
peace
they
comfort
themselves
with
the
hope
that
the
worst
will
not
happen
although
history
shows
that
the
misery
produced
by
weakness
has
often
surpassed
all
expectations
but
even
if
the
nation
can
hardly
be
expected
to
understand
what
is
necessary
yet
the
war
department
must
be
asked
to
do
their
utmost
to
achieve
what
is
possible
and
not
to
stop
short
out
of
deference
to
public
opinion
when
the
future
of
a
great
and
noble
nation
is
at
stake
there
is
no
room
for
cowardice
or
inaction
nothing
must
be
done
as
unhappily
has
too
often
been
the
case
which
runs
counter
to
the
principles
of
a
sound
military
organization
the
threefold
division
of
the
larger
formations
could
be
effected
in
various
ways
very
divergent
ideas
may
be
entertained
on
this
subject
and
the
difficulties
of
carrying
out
the
scheme
need
extensive
consideration
i
will
make
a
few
proposals
just
by
way
of
illustration
one
way
would
be
to
split
up
the
army
corps
into
three
divisions
of
three
infantry
regiments
each
and
to
abolish
the
superfluous
intermediate
system
of
brigades
another
proposal
would
be
to
form
in
every
corps
one
of
the
present
divisions
of
three
brigades
so
that
the
extra
brigade
combined
with
the
light
field
howitzers
and
the
jäger
battalion
would
constitute
in
event
of
war
a
separate
detachment
in
the
hands
of
the
commanding
general
this
last
arrangement
could
be
carried
out
comparatively
easily
under
our
present
system
but
entails
the
drawback
that
the
system
of
twofold
division
is
still
in
force
within
the
brigades
and
divisions
the
most
sweeping
reform
that
of
dividing
the
corps
into
three
divisions
would
have
the
advantage
of
being
thorough
and
would
allow
the
separate
groups
to
be
employed
in
many
more
ways
the
relations
between
the
infantry
and
the
artillery
can
naturally
only
be
improved
gradually
by
the
strengthening
of
the
infantry
through
the
enforcement
of
universal
service
the
assignment
of
a
fifth
brigade
to
each
army
corps
would
produce
better
conditions
than
exist
at
present
but
so
soon
as
the
strengthening
of
the
infantry
has
gone
so
far
that
new
army
corps
must
be
created
the
artillery
required
for
them
can
be
taken
from
existing
formations
and
these
can
be
diminished
by
this
means
it
will
conduce
to
the
general
efficiency
of
the
army
if
the
artillery
destined
for
each
army
corps
is
to
some
degree
limited
without
however
reducing
their
total
care
must
be
taken
that
only
the
quantity
of
ammunition
necessary
for
the
first
stages
of
the
battle
should
be
habitually
carried
by
the
columns
of
the
troops
engaged
all
that
exceeds
this
must
be
kept
in
the
rear
behind
the
commissariat
waggons
and
brought
forward
only
on
necessity
that
is
to
say
when
a
battle
is
in
prospect
the
certainty
of
being
able
to
feed
the
troops
and
thus
maintain
the
rapidity
of
the
advance
is
far
more
important
than
the
more
or
less
theoretical
advantage
of
having
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
close
at
hand
during
the
advance
the
soldiers
will
be
inclined
to
be
sparing
of
ammunition
in
the
critical
stages
of
the
fight
and
will
not
be
disposed
to
engage
with
an
unseen
enemy
who
can
only
be
attacked
by
scattered
fire
the
full
fire
strength
will
be
reserved
for
the
deciding
moments
of
the
engagement
then
however
the
required
ammunition
will
be
on
the
spot
in
any
event
if
it
is
brought
forward
by
stages
in
good
time
a
suitable
organization
of
the
artillery
would
insure
that
each
division
had
an
equal
number
of
batteries
at
its
disposal
the
light
field
howitzers
however
must
be
attached
to
a
division
in
such
a
way
that
they
may
form
an
artillery
corps
without
necessarily
breaking
up
the
formations
of
the
division
the
strength
of
the
artillery
must
be
regulated
according
to
that
of
the
infantry
in
such
a
way
that
the
entire
marching
depth
does
not
exceed
some
kilometres
the
heavy
field
howitzers
on
the
other
hand
must
in
peace
be
placed
under
the
orders
of
the
general
commanding
and
in
event
of
war
be
combined
as
army
artillery
it
would
perhaps
be
advisable
if
the
cavalry
were
completely
detached
from
the
corps
formation
since
the
main
body
is
absolutely
independent
in
war
as
army
cavalry
the
regiments
necessary
for
service
with
the
infantry
could
be
called
out
in
turn
during
for
manoeuvres
with
mixed
arms
in
order
to
be
trained
in
the
work
of
divisional
cavalry
for
which
purpose
garrison
training
can
also
be
utilized
on
the
other
hand
it
is
i
know
often
alleged
that
the
are
better
trained
and
learn
much
if
the
cavalry
are
under
their
orders
but
this
objection
does
not
seem
very
pertinent
another
way
to
adapt
the
organization
better
to
the
efficiency
of
the
arm
than
at
present
would
be
that
the
four
cavalry
regiments
belonging
to
each
army
corps
should
be
combined
into
a
brigade
and
placed
under
the
commanding
general
in
event
of
mobilization
one
regiment
would
be
withdrawn
for
the
two
divisions
while
the
brigade
now
three
regiments
strong
would
pass
over
to
the
army
cavalry
the
regiment
intended
for
divisional
cavalry
would
on
mobilization
form
itself
into
six
squadrons
and
place
three
of
them
at
the
service
of
each
division
if
the
army
corps
was
formed
into
three
divisions
each
division
would
only
be
able
to
receive
two
squadrons
in
this
way
of
course
a
very
weak
and
inferior
divisional
cavalry
would
be
formed
the
service
in
the
field
would
suffer
heavily
under
it
but
since
it
is
still
more
important
to
have
at
hand
a
sufficient
army
cavalry
than
a
divisional
cavalry
quite
competent
for
their
difficult
task
there
is
for
the
time
being
no
course
left
than
to
raise
the
one
to
its
indispensable
strength
at
the
cost
of
the
other
the
blame
for
such
a
makeshift
which
seriously
injures
the
army
falls
upon
those
who
did
not
advocate
an
increase
of
the
cavalry
at
the
proper
moment
the
whole
discussion
shows
how
absolutely
necessary
such
an
increase
is
if
it
were
effected
it
would
naturally
react
upon
the
organization
of
the
arm
this
would
have
to
be
adapted
to
the
new
conditions
there
are
various
ways
in
which
a
sound
and
suitable
development
of
the
cavalry
can
be
guaranteed
the
absolutely
necessary
cyclist
sections
must
in
any
case
be
attached
to
the
cavalry
in
peace
in
order
that
the
two
arms
may
be
drilled
in
and
that
the
cavalry
commander
may
learn
to
make
appropriate
use
of
this
important
arm
since
the
cyclists
are
restricted
to
fairly
good
roads
the
presents
difficulties
which
require
to
be
surmounted
the
views
which
i
have
here
tried
to
sketch
as
aspects
of
the
organization
of
the
army
can
be
combated
from
several
standpoints
in
military
questions
particularly
different
estimates
of
the
individual
factors
lead
to
very
different
results
i
believe
however
that
my
opinions
result
with
a
certain
logical
necessity
from
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
it
is
most
essential
in
preparing
for
war
to
keep
the
main
leading
idea
fixed
and
firm
and
not
to
allow
it
to
be
shaken
by
question
of
detail
each
special
requirement
must
be
regarded
as
part
of
that
general
combination
of
things
which
only
really
comes
into
view
in
actual
warfare
the
special
standpoint
of
a
particular
arm
must
be
rejected
as
unjustified
and
the
departmental
spirit
must
be
silenced
care
must
be
taken
not
to
overestimate
the
technical
and
material
means
of
power
in
spite
of
their
undoubted
importance
and
to
take
sufficient
account
of
the
spiritual
and
moral
factors
our
age
which
has
made
such
progress
in
the
conquest
of
nature
is
inclined
to
attach
too
much
importance
to
this
dominion
over
natural
forces
but
in
the
last
resort
the
forces
that
give
victory
are
in
the
men
and
not
in
the
means
which
they
employ
a
profound
knowledge
of
generalship
and
a
personality
are
essential
to
enable
the
war
preparations
to
be
suitably
carried
out
under
the
shifting
influence
of
different
aims
and
ideas
the
organizer
of
victory
will
often
feel
doubtful
whether
he
ought
to
decide
this
way
or
that
the
only
satisfactory
solution
of
such
doubts
is
to
deduce
from
a
view
of
warfare
in
its
entirety
and
its
varied
phases
and
demands
the
importance
of
the
separate
factors
for
he
who
grasps
the
problem
as
a
whole
has
calmed
the
storm
that
rages
in
his
soul
chapter
xi
training
and
education
our
first
object
then
must
be
to
organize
and
transform
the
german
army
into
the
most
effective
tool
of
german
policy
and
into
a
school
of
health
and
strength
for
our
nation
we
must
also
try
to
get
ahead
of
our
rivals
by
superiority
of
training
and
at
the
same
time
to
do
full
justice
to
the
social
requirements
of
the
army
by
exerting
all
our
efforts
towards
raising
the
spiritual
and
moral
level
of
the
units
and
strengthening
their
loyal
german
feelings
diligence
and
devotion
to
military
education
are
no
longer
at
the
present
day
sufficient
to
make
our
troops
superior
to
the
enemy
for
there
are
men
working
no
less
devotedly
in
the
hostile
armies
if
we
wish
to
gain
a
start
there
is
only
one
way
to
do
it
the
training
must
break
with
all
that
is
antiquated
and
proceed
in
the
spirit
of
the
war
of
the
future
which
will
impose
fresh
requirements
on
the
troops
as
well
as
on
the
officers
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
into
the
details
about
the
training
in
the
use
of
modern
arms
and
technical
contrivances
this
follows
necessarily
from
the
introduction
of
these
means
of
war
but
if
we
survey
the
sphere
of
training
as
a
whole
two
phenomena
of
modern
warfare
will
strike
us
as
peculiarly
important
with
regard
to
it
the
heightened
demands
which
will
be
made
on
individual
character
and
the
employment
of
masses
to
an
extent
hitherto
unknown
the
necessity
for
increased
individualization
in
the
case
of
infantry
and
artillery
results
directly
from
the
character
of
the
modern
battle
in
the
case
of
cavalry
it
is
due
to
the
nature
of
their
strategical
duties
and
the
need
of
sometimes
fighting
on
foot
like
infantry
in
the
case
of
leaders
of
every
grade
from
the
immensity
of
the
armies
the
vast
extent
of
the
spheres
of
operation
and
fields
of
battle
and
the
difficulty
inseparable
from
all
these
conditions
of
giving
direct
orders
wherever
we
turn
our
eyes
to
the
wide
sphere
of
modern
warfare
we
encounter
the
necessity
of
independent
action
by
the
private
soldier
in
the
thick
of
the
battle
or
the
lonely
patrol
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
country
as
much
as
by
the
leader
of
an
army
who
handles
huge
hosts
in
battle
as
well
as
in
operations
the
requisite
uniformity
of
action
can
only
be
attained
at
the
present
time
by
independent
of
all
in
accordance
with
a
fixed
general
scheme
the
employment
of
masses
requires
an
entirely
altered
method
of
moving
and
feeding
the
troops
it
is
one
thing
to
lead
or
perhaps
men
in
a
rich
country
seamed
with
roads
and
concentrate
them
for
a
battle
it
is
another
to
manoeuvre
men
on
a
scene
of
war
stripped
bare
by
the
enemy
where
all
railroads
and
bridges
have
been
destroyed
by
modern
explosives
in
the
first
case
the
military
empiric
may
be
equal
to
the
occasion
the
second
case
demands
imperatively
a
scientifically
educated
general
and
a
staff
who
have
also
studied
and
mastered
for
themselves
the
nature
of
modern
warfare
the
problems
of
the
future
must
be
solved
in
advance
if
a
commander
wishes
to
be
able
to
operate
in
a
modern
theatre
of
war
with
certainty
and
rapid
decision
the
necessity
of
individualization
then
is
universally
recognized
to
be
sure
the
old
traditions
die
slowly
here
and
there
an
undeserved
importance
is
still
attached
to
the
march
past
as
a
method
of
education
and
drilling
in
close
formation
is
sometimes
practised
more
than
is
justified
by
its
value
the
cavalry
is
not
yet
completely
awakened
from
its
slumbers
and
performs
the
exercises
on
the
with
great
strain
on
the
horses
strength
oblivious
of
the
existence
of
guns
and
as
if
they
were
still
the
old
arm
which
napoleon
or
frederick
the
great
commanded
even
the
artillery
is
still
haunted
by
some
more
or
less
antiquated
notions
technical
and
stereotyped
ideas
still
sometimes
restrict
the
freedom
of
operations
in
the
practice
of
manoeuvres
artillery
duels
are
still
in
vogue
while
sufficient
attention
is
not
given
to
concentration
of
fire
with
a
definite
purpose
and
to
with
the
infantry
even
in
theory
the
necessity
of
the
artillery
duel
is
still
asserted
many
conservative
notions
linger
on
in
the
heavy
artillery
obsolete
ideas
have
not
yet
wholly
disappeared
even
from
the
new
regulations
and
ordinances
where
they
block
the
path
of
true
progress
but
on
the
whole
it
has
been
realized
that
greater
individual
responsibility
and
must
be
encouraged
in
this
respect
the
army
is
on
the
right
road
and
if
it
continues
on
it
and
continually
resists
the
temptation
of
restricting
the
independence
of
the
subordinate
for
the
sake
of
outward
appearance
there
is
room
for
hope
that
gradually
the
highest
results
will
be
attained
provided
that
competent
military
criticism
has
been
equally
encouraged
in
this
direction
a
healthy
development
has
started
but
insufficient
attention
has
been
given
to
the
fact
that
the
main
features
of
war
have
completely
changed
although
in
the
next
war
men
will
have
to
be
handled
by
millions
the
training
of
our
officers
is
still
being
conducted
on
lines
which
belong
to
a
past
era
and
virtually
ignore
modern
conditions
our
manoeuvres
more
especially
follow
these
lines
most
of
the
practical
training
is
carried
out
in
manoeuvres
of
brigades
and
divisions
in
formations
which
could
never
occur
in
the
great
decisive
campaigns
of
the
future
from
time
to
time
financial
grounds
unfortunately
prevent
it
being
an
annual
affair
a
corps
manoeuvre
is
held
which
also
can
not
be
regarded
as
training
for
the
command
of
masses
sometimes
but
rarely
several
army
corps
are
assembled
for
combined
training
under
veteran
generals
who
soon
afterwards
leave
the
service
and
so
can
not
give
the
army
the
benefit
of
any
experience
which
they
may
have
gained
it
can
not
of
course
be
denied
that
manoeuvres
are
extraordinarily
instructive
and
useful
especially
for
the
troops
themselves
but
they
are
not
a
direct
training
for
the
command
of
armies
in
modern
warfare
even
the
imperial
manoeuvres
only
correspond
to
a
very
slight
extent
to
the
requirements
of
modern
war
since
they
never
take
account
of
the
commissariat
arrangements
and
seldom
of
the
arrangements
for
sheltering
the
troops
which
would
be
essential
in
real
warfare
a
glance
at
the
imperial
manoeuvres
of
is
sufficient
to
show
that
many
of
the
operations
could
never
have
been
carried
out
had
it
been
a
question
of
the
troops
being
fed
under
the
conditions
of
war
it
is
an
absolute
necessity
that
our
officers
should
learn
to
pay
adequate
attention
to
these
points
which
are
the
rule
in
warfare
and
appreciably
cramp
the
power
of
operations
in
theory
of
course
the
commissariat
waggons
are
always
taken
into
account
they
are
conscientiously
mentioned
in
all
orders
and
in
theory
are
posted
as
a
commissariat
reserve
between
the
corps
and
the
divisions
that
they
would
in
reality
all
have
to
circulate
with
a
frequency
between
the
troops
and
the
magazines
that
the
magazines
would
have
to
be
almost
daily
brought
forward
or
sent
farther
back
that
the
position
of
the
field
bakeries
is
of
extreme
importance
these
are
all
points
which
are
inconvenient
and
troublesome
and
so
are
very
seldom
considered
in
great
strategic
too
even
in
a
theatre
of
war
selected
in
russia
which
excludes
all
living
upon
the
country
the
commissariat
arrangements
are
rarely
worked
out
in
detail
i
should
almost
doubt
whether
on
such
occasions
the
possibility
of
exclusive
magazine
feeding
has
ever
been
entertained
even
smaller
opportunities
of
being
acquainted
with
these
conditions
are
given
to
the
officer
in
ordinary
manoeuvres
and
yet
it
is
extremely
difficult
on
purely
theoretical
lines
to
become
familiar
with
the
machinery
for
moving
and
feeding
a
large
army
and
to
master
the
subject
efficiently
the
friction
and
the
obstacles
which
occur
in
reality
can
not
be
brought
home
to
the
student
in
theory
and
the
routine
in
managing
such
things
can
not
be
learnt
from
books
these
conditions
then
are
a
great
check
on
the
freedom
of
operations
but
quite
apart
from
the
commissariat
question
the
movements
of
an
army
present
considerable
difficulties
in
themselves
which
it
is
obviously
very
hard
for
the
inexperienced
to
surmount
when
in
some
rather
complicated
army
movements
were
contemplated
as
on
the
advance
to
sedan
it
was
at
once
seen
that
the
chief
commanders
were
not
masters
of
the
situation
that
only
the
fertility
of
the
theatre
of
war
and
the
deficient
attacking
powers
of
the
french
allowed
the
operations
to
succeed
although
a
man
like
moltke
was
at
the
head
of
the
army
all
these
matters
have
since
been
thoroughly
worked
out
by
our
general
staff
but
the
theoretical
labours
of
the
general
staff
are
by
no
means
the
common
property
of
the
army
on
all
these
grounds
i
believe
that
first
and
foremost
our
manoeuvres
must
be
placed
on
a
new
footing
corresponding
to
the
completely
altered
conditions
and
that
we
must
leave
the
beaten
paths
of
tradition
the
troops
must
be
trained
as
formerly
to
the
highest
tactical
efficiency
and
the
army
must
be
developed
into
the
most
effective
machine
for
carrying
out
operations
success
in
modern
war
turns
on
these
two
pivots
but
the
leaders
must
be
definitely
educated
for
that
war
on
the
great
scale
which
some
day
will
have
to
be
fought
to
a
finish
the
paths
we
have
hitherto
followed
do
not
lead
to
this
goal
all
methods
of
training
and
education
must
be
in
accordance
with
these
views
i
do
not
propose
to
go
further
into
the
battle
training
of
infantry
and
cavalry
in
this
place
since
i
have
already
discussed
the
question
at
length
in
special
treatises
a
in
the
case
of
the
artillery
alone
some
remarks
on
the
principles
guiding
the
technical
training
of
this
arm
seem
necessary

the
demands
on
the
of
this
arm
as
is
partly
expressed
in
the
regulations
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
all
preconceived
ideas
and
theories
as
to
its
employment
must
be
put
on
one
side
and
its
one
guiding
principle
must
be
to
support
the
cavalry
or
infantry
at
the
decisive
point
this
principle
is
universally
acknowledged
in
theory
but
it
ought
to
be
more
enforced
in
practice
the
artillery
therefore
must
try
more
than
ever
to
bring
their
tactical
duties
into
the
foreground
and
to
make
their
special
technical
requirements
subservient
to
this
idea
the
tendency
to
fight
chiefly
the
enemy
artillery
must
be
emphatically
checked
on
the
defensive
it
will
of
course
often
be
necessary
to
engage
the
attacking
artillery
if
there
is
any
prospect
of
success
since
this
is
the
most
dreaded
enemy
of
the
infantry
on
the
defensive
but
on
the
attack
its
chief
duty
always
is
to
fire
upon
the
enemy
infantry
where
possible
from
masked
positions
the
principle
of
keeping
the
artillery
divisions
close
together
on
the
battlefield
and
combining
the
fire
in
one
direction
must
not
be
carried
to
an
extreme
the
artillery
certainly
must
be
employed
on
a
large
plan
and
the
chief
in
command
must
see
that
there
is
a
concentration
of
effort
at
the
decisive
points
but
in
particular
cases
and
among
the
varying
incidents
of
a
battle
this
idea
will
be
carried
out
less
effectively
by
uniformity
of
orders
than
by
explaining
the
general
scheme
to
the
subordinate
officers
and
leaving
to
them
the
duty
of
carrying
it
out
accordingly
it
is
important
that
the
personal
initiative
of
the
subordinate
officer
should
be
recognized
more
fully
than
before
for
in
a
crisis
such
independent
action
is
indispensable
the
great
extent
of
the
battlefields
and
the
natural
endeavour
to
select
wooded
and
irregular
ground
for
the
attack
will
often
force
the
artillery
to
advance
in
groups
or
in
lines
one
behind
the
other
and
to
attempt
notwithstanding
united
action
against
the
tactically
most
important
objective
this
result
is
hard
to
attain
by
a
centralization
of
command
and
is
best
realized
by
the
independent
action
of
tactically
trained
subordinates
this
is
not
the
place
to
enter
into
technical
details
and
i
will
only
mention
some
points
which
appear
especially
important
the
bz
shell
granatschuss
should
be
withdrawn
as
unsuitable
and
its
use
should
not
form
part
of
the
training
it
requires
in
order
to
attain
its
specific
effect
against
such
accurate
aiming
as
is
very
seldom
possible
in
actual
warfare
no
very
great
value
should
be
attached
to
firing
with
shrapnel
it
seems
to
be
retained
in
france
and
to
have
shown
satisfactory
results
with
us
but
care
must
be
taken
not
to
apply
the
experiences
of
the
directly
to
serious
warfare
no
doubt
its
use
if
successful
promises
rapid
results
but
it
may
easily
lead
especially
in
the
mass
battle
to
great
errors
in
calculation
in
any
case
practice
with
az
shot
is
more
trustworthy
and
is
of
the
first
importance
the
az
fire
must
be
reserved
principally
for
the
last
stages
of
an
offensive
engagement
as
was
lately
laid
down
in
the
regulations
care
must
be
taken
generally
not
to
go
too
far
in
refinements
and
complications
of
strategy
and
devices
only
the
simplest
methods
can
be
successfully
applied
in
battle
this
fact
must
never
be
forgotten
the
important
point
in
the
general
training
of
the
artillery
is
that
pedantries
for
example
in
the
reports
on
shooting
should
be
relegated
more
than
hitherto
to
the
background
and
that
tactics
should
be
given
a
more
prominent
position
in
this
way
only
can
the
artillery
do
really
good
service
in
action
but
the
technique
of
shooting
must
not
be
neglected
in
the
reports
that
would
mean
rejecting
the
good
and
the
evil
together
and
the
tendency
to
abolish
such
reports
as
inconvenient
must
be
distinctly
opposed
under
this
head
attention
must
be
called
to
the
independent
manoeuvres
of
artillery
regiments
and
brigades
in
the
country
which
entail
large
expenditure
and
in
fact
do
more
harm
than
good
they
must
in
my
opinion
be
abandoned
or
at
least
considerably
modified
since
their
possible
use
is
not
in
proportion
to
their
cost
and
their
drawbacks
they
lead
to
pronounced
tactics
of
position
stellungstaktik
which
are
impracticable
in
war
and
the
most
important
lesson
in
actual
war
the
timely
employment
of
artillery
within
a
defined
space
and
for
a
definite
object
without
any
previous
reconnoitring
of
the
country
in
search
of
suitable
positions
for
the
batteries
can
never
be
learnt
on
these
manoeuvres
they
could
be
made
more
instructive
if
the
tactical
limits
were
marked
by
troops
but
the
chief
defect
in
these
manoeuvres
that
the
artillery
is
regarded
as
the
decisive
arm
can
not
be
thus
remedied
the
usual
result
is
that
favourable
artillery
positions
are
searched
for
and
that
they
are
then
adhered
to
under
some
tactical
pretence
after
all
only
a
slight
shifting
of
the
existing
centre
of
gravity
may
be
necessary
so
far
as
the
development
of
the
fighting
of
the
various
branches
of
the
service
is
concerned
in
order
to
bring
them
into
line
with
modern
conditions
if
however
the
troops
are
to
be
educated
to
a
higher
efficiency
in
completely
new
ground
must
be
broken
on
which
i
am
convinced
great
results
and
an
undoubted
superiority
over
our
opponents
can
be
attained
considerable
difficulties
will
have
to
be
surmounted
for
the
crucial
point
is
to
amass
immense
armies
on
a
genuine
war
footing
but
these
difficulties
are
not
in
my
opinion
insurmountable
there
are
two
chief
points
first
the
practice
of
marching
and
operations
in
formations
at
war
strength
fully
equipped
with
magazines
as
on
active
service
and
secondly
a
reorganization
of
the
manoeuvres
which
must
be
combined
with
a
more
thorough
education
of
the
chief
commanders
as
regards
the
first
point
practice
on
this
scale
so
far
as
i
know
has
never
yet
been
attempted
but
if
we
consider
firstly
how
valuable
more
rapid
and
accurate
movements
of
great
masses
will
be
for
the
war
of
the
future
and
secondly
what
serious
difficulties
they
involve
we
shall
be
rewarded
for
the
attempt
to
prepare
the
army
systematically
for
the
discharge
of
such
duties
and
thus
to
win
an
unquestioned
advantage
over
our
supposed
antagonist
the
preparation
for
the
larger
manoeuvres
of
this
sort
can
naturally
also
be
carried
out
in
smaller
formation
it
is
moreover
very
important
to
train
large
masses
of
troops
brigades
and
divisions
in
long
marches
across
country
by
night
and
day
with
pioneer
sections
in
the
vanguard
in
order
to
gain
experience
for
the
technique
of
such
movements
and
to
acquire
by
practice
a
certain
security
in
them
training
marches
with
full
military
stores
in
columns
of
to
kilometres
depth
would
be
still
more
valuable
since
they
correspond
to
the
daily
needs
of
real
warfare
should
it
not
be
possible
to
assemble
two
army
corps
in
such
manoeuvres
then
the
necessary
depth
of
march
can
be
obtained
by
letting
the
separate
detachments
march
with
suitable
intervals
in
which
case
the
intervals
must
be
very
strictly
observed
this
does
not
ever
really
reproduce
the
conditions
of
actual
warfare
but
it
is
useful
as
a
makeshift
the
waggons
for
the
troops
would
have
to
be
hired
as
on
manoeuvres
though
only
partly
in
order
to
save
expense
the
supplies
could
be
brought
on
army
transport
trains
which
would
represent
the
pioneer
convoys
verpflegungsstaffel
and
would
regulate
their
pace
accordingly
marching
merely
for
training
purposes
in
large
formations
with
food
supplied
from
the
during
the
march
would
also
be
of
considerable
value
provided
that
care
is
taken
to
execute
the
march
in
the
shortest
possible
time
and
to
replace
the
provisions
consumed
by
bringing
fresh
supplies
forward
from
the
rear
this
process
is
only
properly
seen
when
the
march
with
supplies
as
if
in
war
is
continued
for
several
days
it
is
naturally
not
enough
to
undertake
these
manoeuvres
once
in
a
way
they
must
be
a
permanent
institution
if
they
are
intended
to
develop
a
sound
knowledge
of
marching
in
the
army
finally
flank
marches
must
be
practised
sometimes
in
separate
columns
sometimes
in
army
formation
the
flank
marches
of
separate
columns
will
of
course
be
useful
only
when
they
are
combined
with
practice
in
feeding
an
army
as
if
in
war
so
that
the
commissariat
columns
march
on
the
side
away
from
the
enemy
in
a
parallel
line
and
are
thence
brought
up
to
the
troops
at
the
close
of
the
march
flank
marches
in
army
formation
will
have
some
value
even
apart
from
any
training
in
the
commissariat
system
since
the
simultaneous
crossing
of
several
marching
columns
on
parallel
is
not
an
easy
manoeuvre
in
itself
but
this
exercise
will
have
its
full
value
only
when
the
regulation
commissariat
waggons
are
attached
which
would
have
to
move
with
them
and
furnish
the
supplies
i
also
consider
that
operative
movements
in
army
formation
extending
over
several
days
are
desirable
practice
must
be
given
in
moving
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
most
various
combinations
in
flank
movements
and
in
doubling
back
the
lines
of
communication
in
the
rear
being
blocked
when
necessary
then
only
can
all
the
difficulties
which
occur
on
such
movements
be
shown
one
by
one
and
it
can
be
seen
where
the
lever
must
be
applied
in
order
to
remove
them
in
this
way
alone
can
the
higher
commanders
gain
the
necessary
certainty
in
conducting
such
operations
so
as
to
be
able
to
employ
them
under
the
pressure
of
a
hostile
attack
an
army
so
disciplined
would
i
imagine
acquire
a
pronounced
superiority
over
any
opponent
who
made
his
first
experiments
in
such
operations
in
actual
war
the
major
strategic
movements
on
both
sides
in
the
war
of
sufficiently
showed
that
i
recognize
naturally
that
all
exercises
on
this
scale
would
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
and
could
never
all
be
carried
out
systematically
one
after
the
other
i
wished
however
to
ventilate
the
subject
firstly
in
order
to
recommend
all
officers
in
high
command
to
study
the
points
of
view
under
consideration
a
thing
they
much
neglect
to
do
secondly
because
it
might
be
sometimes
profitable
and
possible
to
carry
out
in
practice
one
or
other
of
them
at
the
imperial
manoeuvres
for
example
or
on
some
other
occasion
how
much
could
be
saved
in
money
alone
and
applied
usefully
to
this
purpose
were
the
country
manoeuvres
of
the
artillery
suspended
from
reasons
of
economy
all
the
commissariat
waggons
and
columns
need
not
actually
be
employed
on
such
manoeuvres
it
would
be
useful
however
if
in
addition
to
one
detachment
equipped
on
a
war
footing
the
head
waggons
of
the
other
groups
were
present
and
were
moved
along
at
the
proper
distance
from
each
other
and
from
the
detachment
which
could
mainly
be
fed
from
the
kitchen
waggon
it
would
thus
be
possible
to
get
a
sort
of
presentation
of
the
whole
course
of
the
commissariat
business
and
to
acquire
valuable
experience
it
is
indeed
extraordinarily
difficult
to
arrange
such
manoeuvres
properly
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
much
friction
and
many
obstacles
are
got
rid
of
if
only
the
heads
of
the
groups
are
marked
out
and
that
false
ideas
thus
arise
which
may
lead
to
erroneous
conclusions
but
under
careful
direction
such
manoeuvres
would
certainly
not
be
wholly
useless
especially
if
attention
is
mainly
paid
to
the
matters
which
are
really
essential
they
would
at
any
rate
be
far
more
valuable
than
many
small
manoeuvres
which
can
frequently
be
replaced
by
exercises
on
the
large
than
many
expensive
trainings
in
the
country
which
are
of
no
real
utility
or
than
many
other
military
institutions
which
are
only
remotely
connected
with
the
object
of
training
under
active
service
conditions
all
that
does
not
directly
promote
this
object
must
be
erased
from
our
system
of
education
at
a
time
when
the
highest
values
are
at
stake
even
then
exercise
in
operations
on
a
large
scale
can
not
often
be
carried
out
primarily
because
of
the
probable
cost
and
next
because
it
is
not
advisable
to
interrupt
too
often
the
tactical
training
of
the
troops
it
must
be
repeated
in
a
definite
cycle
in
each
large
formation
so
that
eventually
all
superior
officers
may
have
the
opportunity
of
becoming
practically
acquainted
with
these
operations
and
also
that
the
troops
may
become
familiarized
with
the
modern
commissariat
system
but
since
such
practical
exercises
must
always
be
somewhat
incomplete
they
must
also
be
worked
out
beforehand
theoretically
it
is
not
at
all
sufficient
that
the
officers
on
the
general
staff
and
the
intendants
have
a
mastery
of
these
subjects
the
rank
and
file
must
be
well
up
in
them
but
especially
the
officers
who
will
be
employed
on
the
supply
service
that
is
to
say
the
transport
officers
of
the
standing
army
and
those
officers
on
the
furlough
establishment
who
would
be
employed
as
column
commanders
the
practical
service
in
the
transport
battalions
and
the
duties
performed
by
the
officers
of
the
category
who
are
assigned
to
these
battalions
are
insufficient
to
attain
this
object
they
learn
from
these
mainly
practical
duties
next
to
nothing
of
the
system
as
a
whole
it
would
therefore
be
advisable
that
all
these
officers
should
go
through
a
special
preliminary
course
for
this
service
in
which
the
whole
machinery
of
the
army
movements
would
be
explained
to
them
by
the
officers
of
the
general
staff
and
the
higher
transport
service
officers
and
they
would
then
learn
by
practical
examples
to
calculate
the
whole
movement
of
the
columns
in
the
most
varied
positions
with
precise
regard
to
distances
and
time
this
would
be
far
more
valuable
for
war
than
the
many
and
often
excessive
trainings
in
driving
on
which
so
much
time
is
wasted
the
technical
driver
duty
is
very
simple
in
all
columns
and
trains
but
it
is
not
easy
to
know
in
each
position
what
is
the
crucial
point
in
order
to
be
able
when
occasion
arises
to
act
independently
while
therefore
on
the
one
hand
driving
instruction
must
be
thoroughly
carried
out
on
the
other
hand
the
institution
of
a
scientific
transport
service
course
in
which
by
practical
examples
out
of
military
history
the
importance
of
these
matters
can
be
explained
is
under
present
circumstances
an
absolute
necessity
i
have
shown
elsewhere
how
necessary
it
is
to
proceed
absolutely
systematically
in
the
arrangements
for
relays
of
supplies
since
the
operative
capabilities
of
the
army
depend
on
this
system
its
nature
however
can
not
be
realized
by
the
officers
concerned
like
a
sudden
inspiration
when
mobilization
takes
place
knowledge
of
its
principles
must
be
gained
by
study
and
a
proof
of
the
complete
misapprehension
of
the
importance
which
this
service
has
attained
under
modern
conditions
is
that
officers
are
supposed
to
be
able
to
manage
it
successfully
without
having
made
in
a
profound
scientific
study
of
the
matter
the
transport
service
has
advanced
to
a
place
of
extraordinary
importance
in
the
general
system
of
modern
warfare
it
should
be
appreciated
accordingly
every
active
transport
service
officer
ought
after
some
years
service
to
attend
a
scientific
course
all
the
senior
officers
on
the
furlough
establishment
intended
for
transport
service
ought
as
their
first
duty
to
be
summoned
to
attend
such
a
course
if
these
educational
courses
were
held
in
the
autumn
in
the
training
camps
of
the
troops
they
would
entail
little
extra
cost
and
an
inestimable
advantage
would
be
gained
with
a
very
trifling
outlay
the
results
of
such
a
measure
can
only
be
fully
realized
in
war
when
the
superior
officers
also
thoroughly
grasp
these
matters
and
do
not
make
demands
contrary
to
the
nature
of
the
case
and
therefore
impossible
to
be
met
they
should
therefore
be
obliged
to
undergo
a
thorough
education
in
the
practical
duties
of
the
general
staff
and
not
merely
in
leading
troops
in
action
this
reflection
leads
to
the
discussion
of
the
momentous
question
how
generally
the
training
of
the
superior
officers
for
the
great
war
should
be
managed
and
how
the
manoeuvres
ought
to
be
reorganized
with
a
view
to
the
training
the
essential
contradiction
between
our
obsolete
method
of
training
and
the
completely
altered
demands
of
a
new
era
appears
here
with
peculiar
distinctness
a
large
part
of
our
superior
commanders
pass
through
the
general
staff
while
part
have
attended
at
least
the
military
academy
but
when
these
men
reach
the
higher
positions
what
they
learnt
in
their
youth
has
long
become
out
of
date
the
continuation
school
is
missing
it
can
be
replaced
only
by
personal
study
but
there
is
generally
insufficient
time
for
this
and
often
a
lack
of
interest
the
daily
duties
of
training
troops
claim
all
the
officer
energy
and
he
needs
great
determination
and
love
of
hard
work
to
continue
vigorously
his
own
scientific
education
the
result
is
that
comparatively
few
of
our
superior
officers
have
a
fairly
thorough
knowledge
much
less
an
independently
thought
out
view
of
the
conditions
of
war
on
the
great
scale
this
would
cost
dearly
in
real
war
experience
shows
that
it
is
not
enough
that
the
officers
of
the
general
staff
attached
to
the
leader
are
competent
to
fill
up
this
gap
the
leader
if
he
can
not
himself
grasp
the
conditions
becomes
the
tool
of
his
subordinates
he
believes
he
is
directing
and
is
himself
being
directed
this
is
a
far
from
healthy
condition
our
present
manoeuvres
are
as
already
mentioned
only
occasionally
a
school
for
officers
in
a
strategical
sense
and
from
the
tactical
point
of
view
they
do
not
meet
modern
requirements
the
minor
manoeuvres
especially
do
not
represent
what
is
the
most
important
feature
in
warfare
the
sudden
concentration
of
larger
forces
on
the
one
side
and
the
impossibility
from
space
considerations
of
timely
on
the
other
the
minor
manoeuvres
are
certainly
useful
in
many
respects
the
commanders
learn
to
form
decisions
and
to
give
orders
and
these
are
two
important
matters
but
the
same
result
would
follow
from
manoeuvres
on
the
grand
scale
which
would
also
to
some
extent
reproduce
the
modern
conditions
of
warfare
brigade
manoeuvres
especially
belong
to
a
past
generation
and
merely
encourage
wrong
ideas
all
that
the
soldiers
learn
from
them
that
is
fighting
in
the
country
can
be
taught
on
the
army
divisional
manoeuvres
are
still
of
some
value
even
to
the
commanders
the
principles
of
tactical
leadership
in
detail
can
be
exemplified
in
them
but
the
first
instructive
manoeuvres
in
the
modern
sense
are
those
of
the
army
corps
still
more
valuable
are
the
manoeuvres
on
a
larger
scale
in
which
several
army
corps
are
combined
especially
when
the
operating
divisions
are
considered
part
of
one
whole
and
are
compelled
to
act
in
connection
with
one
grand
general
scheme
of
operation
the
great
art
in
organizing
manoeuvres
is
to
reproduce
such
conditions
for
only
in
this
way
can
the
strain
of
the
general
situation
and
the
collective
mass
of
individual
responsibility
such
as
exist
in
actual
warfare
be
distinctly
brought
home
this
is
a
most
weighty
consideration
the
superior
officers
must
have
clearly
brought
before
their
eyes
the
limits
of
the
possible
and
the
impossible
in
modern
warfare
in
order
to
be
trained
to
deal
with
great
situations
the
requirements
which
these
reflections
suggest
are
the
restriction
of
manoeuvres
in
favour
of
the
large
and
predominantly
strategical
manoeuvres
and
next
the
abolition
of
some
less
important
military
exercises
in
order
to
apply
the
money
thus
saved
in
this
direction
we
must
subject
all
our
resources
to
a
single
test
that
they
conduce
to
the
perfecting
of
a
modern
army
we
must
subject
all
our
resources
to
a
single
test
that
they
conduce
to
the
perfecting
of
a
modern
army
if
the
military
are
suitably
enlarged
a
rather
difficult
but
necessary
process
since
in
view
of
the
range
of
the
artillery
and
the
mass
tactics
they
have
generally
become
too
small
a
considerable
part
of
the
work
which
is
done
in
the
divisional
manoeuvres
could
be
carried
out
on
them
the
money
saved
by
this
change
could
be
devoted
to
the
large
army
manoeuvres
one
thing
is
certain
a
great
impulse
must
be
given
to
the
development
of
our
manoeuvre
system
if
it
is
to
fulfil
its
purpose
as
formerly
in
organization
and
execution
these
manoeuvres
must
be
modern
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
it
seems
however
quite
impossible
to
carry
out
this
sort
of
training
on
so
comprehensive
a
scale
that
it
will
by
itself
be
sufficient
to
educate
serviceable
commanders
for
the
great
war
the
manoeuvres
can
only
show
their
full
value
if
the
officers
of
every
rank
who
take
part
in
them
have
already
had
a
competent
training
in
theory
to
encourage
this
preliminary
training
of
the
superior
officers
is
thus
one
of
the
most
serious
tasks
of
an
efficient
preparation
for
war
these
must
not
regard
their
duty
as
lying
exclusively
in
the
training
of
the
troops
but
must
also
be
ever
striving
further
to
educate
themselves
and
their
subordinates
for
leadership
in
the
great
war
strategic
war
games
on
a
large
scale
which
in
the
army
corps
can
be
conducted
by
the
commanding
generals
and
in
the
by
the
inspectors
seem
to
me
to
be
the
only
means
by
which
this
end
can
be
attained
all
superior
officers
must
be
criticized
by
the
standard
of
their
efficiency
in
superior
commands
the
threads
of
all
this
training
will
meet
in
the
hands
of
the
chief
of
the
general
army
staff
as
the
strategically
responsible
authority
it
seems
undesirable
in
any
case
to
leave
it
more
or
less
to
chance
to
decide
whether
those
who
hold
high
commands
will
be
competent
or
not
for
their
posts
the
circumstances
that
a
man
is
an
energetic
commander
of
a
division
or
as
general
in
command
maintains
discipline
in
his
army
corps
affords
no
conclusive
proof
that
he
is
fitted
to
be
the
leader
of
an
army
military
history
supplies
many
instances
of
this
no
proof
is
required
to
show
that
under
the
conditions
of
modern
warfare
the
reconnoitring
and
screening
units
require
special
training
the
possibility
and
the
success
of
all
operations
are
in
the
highest
degree
dependent
on
their
activity
i
have
for
years
pointed
out
the
absolute
necessity
of
preparing
our
cavalry
officers
scientifically
for
their
profession
and
i
can
only
repeat
the
demand
that
our
cavalry
should
be
organized
also
as
places
of
scientific
education
i
will
also
once
more
declare
that
it
is
wrong
that
the
bulk
of
the
training
of
the
army
cavalry
should
consist
in
the
divisional
cavalry
exercises
on
the
military
these
exercises
do
not
correspond
at
all
to
actual
conditions
and
inculcate
quite
wrong
notions
in
the
officers
as
every
cavalry
officer
in
high
command
finds
out
who
having
been
taught
on
the
has
to
lead
a
cavalry
division
on
manoeuvres
the
centre
of
gravity
of
effectiveness
in
war
rests
on
the
directing
of
operations
and
on
the
skilful
transition
from
strategical
independence
to
combination
in
attack
the
great
difficulty
of
leading
cavalry
lies
in
these
conditions
and
this
can
no
more
be
learnt
on
the
than
systematic
screening
and
reconnaissance
duties
the
perpetual
subject
of
practice
on
the
a
cavalry
engagement
between
two
divisions
in
close
formation
will
hardly
ever
occur
in
war
any
unprejudiced
examination
of
the
present
conditions
must
lead
to
this
result
and
counsels
the
cavalry
arm
to
adopt
a
course
which
may
be
regarded
as
a
serious
preparation
for
war
it
is
a
truly
remarkable
fact
that
the
artillery
which
in
fact
always
acts
only
in
combination
with
the
other
arms
carries
out
annually
extensive
independent
manoeuvres
as
if
it
had
by
itself
a
definite
effect
on
the
course
of
the
campaign
while
the
army
cavalry
which
takes
the
field
independently
hardly
ever
trains
by
itself
but
carefully
practises
that
combination
with
infantry
which
is
only
rarely
necessary
in
war
this
clearly
demonstrates
the
unsystematic
and
antiquated
methods
of
all
our
training
practice
in
reconnoitring
and
screening
tactics
as
well
as
raids
on
a
large
scale
are
what
is
wanted
for
the
training
of
the
cavalry
with
the
will
be
a
further
development
so
soon
as
aviation
has
attained
such
successes
that
it
may
be
reckoned
as
an
integral
factor
of
army
organization
the
airship
division
and
the
cavalry
have
kindred
duties
and
must
under
the
same
command
especially
for
screening
purposes
which
are
the
methods
for
the
training
of
pioneers
which
correspond
fully
to
modern
requirements
have
been
pointed
out
by
general
beseler
this
arm
need
only
be
developed
further
in
the
direction
which
this
distinguished
officer
has
indicated
in
order
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
next
war
in
the
field
war
its
chief
importance
will
be
found
to
be
in
the
support
of
the
infantry
in
attacks
on
fortified
positions
and
in
the
construction
of
similar
positions
tactical
requirements
must
however
be
insisted
upon
in
this
connection
the
whole
training
must
be
guided
by
considerations
of
tactics
this
is
the
main
point
as
regards
sieges
especial
attention
must
be
devoted
to
training
the
miners
since
the
object
is
to
capture
rapidly
the
outlying
forts
and
to
take
the
fortresses
which
can
resist
the
attack
of
the
artillery
the
duties
of
the
army
service
corps
b
are
clear
they
must
on
the
one
hand
be
efficiently
trained
for
the
intelligence
department
especially
for
the
various
duties
of
the
telegraph
branch
and
be
ready
to
give
every
kind
of
assistance
to
the
airships
on
the
other
hand
they
must
look
after
and
maintain
the
strategical
capacities
of
the
army
the
rapid
construction
of
railroads
especially
light
railways
the
speedy
repair
of
destroyed
lines
the
protection
of
traffic
on
military
railways
and
the
utilization
of
motors
for
various
purposes
are
the
duties
for
which
these
troops
must
be
trained
a
thorough
knowledge
and
mastery
of
the
essential
principles
of
operations
are
indispensable
qualifications
in
their
case
also
they
can
only
meet
their
and
duties
by
a
competent
acquaintance
with
the
methods
and
system
of
army
movements
on
every
scale
it
is
highly
important
therefore
that
the
officers
of
the
army
service
corps
should
be
thoroughly
trained
in
military
science
footnote
b
thus
in
every
direction
we
see
the
necessity
to
improve
the
intellectual
development
of
the
army
and
to
educate
it
to
an
appreciation
of
the
close
connection
of
the
multifarious
duties
of
war
this
appreciation
is
requisite
not
merely
for
the
leaders
and
special
branches
of
the
service
it
must
permeate
the
whole
corps
of
officers
and
to
some
degree
the
officers
also
it
will
bear
good
fruit
in
the
training
of
the
men
the
higher
the
stage
on
which
the
teacher
stands
and
the
greater
his
intellectual
grasp
of
the
subject
the
more
complete
will
be
his
influence
on
the
scholars
the
more
rapidly
and
successfully
will
he
reach
the
understanding
of
his
subordinates
and
the
more
thoroughly
will
he
win
from
them
that
confidence
and
respect
which
are
the
firmest
foundations
of
discipline
all
the
means
employed
to
improve
the
education
of
our
establishment
of
officers
in
the
science
of
war
and
general
subjects
will
be
richly
repaid
in
efficient
service
on
every
other
field
of
practical
activity
intellectual
exercise
gives
tone
to
brain
and
character
and
a
really
deep
comprehension
of
war
and
its
requirements
postulates
a
certain
philosophic
mental
education
and
bent
which
makes
it
possible
to
assess
the
value
of
phenomena
in
their
reciprocal
relations
and
to
estimate
correctly
the
imponderabilia
the
effort
to
produce
this
higher
intellectual
standard
in
the
corps
must
be
felt
in
their
training
from
the
military
school
onwards
and
must
find
its
expression
in
a
school
of
military
education
of
a
higher
class
than
exists
at
present
a
military
academy
as
such
was
contemplated
by
scharnhorst
it
assumed
rather
the
character
of
a
preparatory
school
for
the
general
staff
instruction
in
history
and
mathematics
is
all
that
remains
of
its
former
importance
the
instruction
in
military
history
was
entirely
divested
of
its
scientific
character
by
the
method
of
application
employed
and
became
wholly
subservient
to
tactics
in
this
way
the
meaning
of
the
study
of
military
history
was
obscured
and
even
so
far
as
i
know
the
lectures
on
military
history
primarily
serve
purposes
of
directly
professional
education
i
can
not
say
how
far
the
language
teaching
imparts
the
spirit
of
foreign
tongues
at
any
rate
it
culminates
in
the
examination
for
interpreterships
and
thus
pursues
a
directly
practical
end
this
development
was
in
a
certain
sense
necessary
a
quite
specifically
professional
education
of
the
officers
of
the
general
staff
is
essential
under
present
conditions
i
will
not
decide
whether
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
limit
the
broad
and
truly
academical
character
of
the
institution
in
any
case
we
need
in
the
army
of
an
institution
which
gives
opportunity
for
the
independent
study
of
military
science
from
the
higher
standpoint
and
provides
at
the
same
time
a
comprehensive
general
education
i
believe
that
the
military
academy
could
be
developed
into
such
an
institution
without
any
necessity
of
abandoning
the
direct
preparation
of
the
officers
for
service
on
the
general
staff
by
the
side
of
the
military
sciences
proper
which
might
be
limited
in
many
directions
lectures
on
general
scientific
subjects
might
be
organized
to
which
admission
should
be
free
in
similar
lectures
the
great
military
problems
might
be
discussed
from
the
standpoint
of
military
philosophy
and
the
hearers
might
gain
some
insight
into
the
legitimacy
of
war
its
relations
to
politics
the
of
material
and
imponderable
forces
the
importance
of
free
personality
under
the
pressure
of
necessary
phenomena
sharp
contradictions
and
violent
opposition
as
well
as
into
the
duties
of
a
commander
viewed
from
the
higher
standpoint
limitation
and
concentration
of
the
compulsory
subjects
such
as
are
now
arranged
on
an
educational
plan
in
three
consecutive
annual
courses
and
the
institution
of
free
lectures
on
subjects
of
general
culture
intended
not
only
to
educate
officers
of
the
general
staff
but
to
train
men
who
are
competent
to
discharge
the
highest
military
and
civic
duties
this
is
what
is
required
for
the
highest
military
educational
institution
of
the
german
army
chapter
xii
preparation
for
the
naval
war
germany
future
lies
on
the
sea
a
proud
saying
which
contains
a
great
truth
if
the
german
people
wish
to
attain
a
distinguished
future
and
fulfil
their
mission
of
civilization
they
must
adopt
a
world
policy
and
act
as
a
world
power
this
task
can
only
be
performed
if
they
are
supported
by
an
adequate
sea
power
our
fleet
must
be
so
strong
at
least
that
a
war
with
us
involves
such
dangers
even
to
the
strongest
opponent
that
the
losses
which
might
be
expected
would
endanger
his
position
as
a
world
power
now
as
proved
in
another
place
we
can
only
stake
our
forces
safely
on
a
world
policy
if
our
political
and
military
superiority
on
the
continent
of
europe
be
immovably
established
this
goal
is
not
yet
reached
and
must
be
our
first
objective
nevertheless
we
must
now
take
steps
to
develop
by
sea
also
a
power
which
is
sufficient
for
our
pretensions
it
is
on
the
one
hand
indispensably
necessary
for
the
full
security
of
our
continental
position
that
we
guard
our
coasts
and
repel
oversea
attacks
on
the
other
hand
it
is
an
absolute
economic
necessity
for
us
to
protect
the
freedom
of
the
seas
by
arms
if
needs
be
since
our
people
depend
for
livelihood
on
the
export
industry
and
this
again
requires
a
large
import
trade
the
political
greatness
of
germany
rests
not
least
on
her
flourishing
economic
life
and
her
oversea
trade
the
maintenance
of
the
freedom
of
the
seas
must
therefore
be
always
before
our
eyes
as
the
object
of
all
our
naval
constructions
our
efforts
must
not
be
merely
directed
towards
the
necessary
repulse
of
hostile
attacks
we
must
be
conscious
of
the
higher
ideal
that
we
wish
to
follow
an
effective
world
policy
and
that
our
naval
power
is
destined
ultimately
to
support
this
world
policy
unfortunately
we
did
not
adopt
this
view
at
the
start
when
we
first
ventured
on
the
open
sea
much
valuable
time
was
wasted
in
striving
for
limited
and
insufficient
objects
the
emperor
william
ii
was
destined
to
be
the
first
to
grasp
this
question
in
its
bearing
on
the
history
and
to
treat
it
accordingly
all
our
earlier
naval
activity
must
be
set
down
as
fruitless
we
have
been
busied
for
years
in
building
a
fleet
most
varied
considerations
guided
our
policy
a
clear
definite
programme
was
first
drawn
up
by
the
great
naval
act
of
the
supplementary
laws
of
and
the
regulations
as
to
the
life
of
the
ships
in
it
is
of
course
improbable
that
the
last
word
has
been
said
on
the
subject
the
needs
of
the
future
will
decide
since
there
can
be
no
certain
standard
for
the
naval
forces
which
a
state
may
require
that
depends
on
the
claims
which
are
put
forward
and
on
the
armaments
of
the
other
nations
at
first
the
only
object
was
to
show
our
flag
on
the
sea
and
on
the
coasts
on
which
we
traded
the
first
duty
of
the
fleet
was
to
safeguard
this
commerce
opposition
to
the
great
outlay
thus
necessitated
was
soon
shown
by
a
party
which
considered
a
fleet
not
merely
superfluous
for
germany
but
actually
dangerous
and
objected
to
the
plans
of
the
government
which
they
stigmatized
as
boundless
another
party
was
content
with
a
simple
scheme
of
only
and
thought
this
object
attained
if
some
important
points
on
the
coast
were
defended
by
artillery
and
cheap
flotillas
of
gunboats
were
stationed
at
various
places
this
view
was
not
long
maintained
all
discerning
persons
were
convinced
of
the
necessity
to
face
and
drive
back
an
aggressive
rival
on
the
high
seas
it
was
recognized
that
ironclads
were
needed
for
this
since
the
aggressor
would
have
them
at
his
disposal
but
this
policy
it
was
thought
could
be
satisfied
by
the
were
sanctioned
but
emphasis
was
laid
on
the
fact
that
we
were
far
from
wishing
to
compete
with
the
existing
large
navies
and
that
we
should
naturally
be
content
with
a
fleet
of
the
second
rank
this
standpoint
was
soon
recognized
to
be
untenable
and
there
was
a
fresh
current
of
feeling
whose
adherents
supported
the
view
that
the
costly
ironclads
could
be
made
superfluous
by
building
in
their
place
a
large
number
of
these
in
spite
of
their
small
fighting
capacity
would
be
able
to
attack
the
strongest
ironclads
by
torpedoes
it
was
soon
realized
that
this
theory
rested
on
a
fallacy
that
a
country
like
the
german
empire
which
depends
on
an
extensive
foreign
trade
in
order
to
find
work
and
food
for
its
growing
population
and
besides
is
hated
everywhere
because
of
its
political
and
economic
prosperity
could
not
forego
a
strong
armament
at
sea
and
on
its
coasts
at
last
a
standpoint
had
been
reached
which
corresponded
with
actual
needs
the
different
abortive
attempts
to
solve
the
navy
question
in
the
most
inexpensive
manner
have
cost
us
much
money
and
above
all
as
already
stated
much
time
so
that
at
the
present
day
when
we
stand
in
the
midst
of
a
great
crisis
in
the
world
history
we
must
summon
all
our
strength
to
make
up
for
lost
opportunities
and
to
build
a
thoroughly
effective
fleet
of
warships
in
addition
to
an
adequate
guard
for
our
coasts
we
have
at
last
come
to
see
that
the
protection
of
our
commerce
and
the
defence
of
our
shores
can
not
possibly
be
the
only
object
of
such
a
fleet
but
that
it
like
the
land
army
is
an
instrument
for
carrying
out
the
political
ends
of
the
state
and
supporting
its
justifiable
ambitions
there
can
be
no
question
of
such
limited
objects
as
protection
of
commerce
and
passive
coast
defence
a
few
cruisers
are
enough
to
protect
commerce
in
times
of
peace
but
in
war
the
only
way
to
safeguard
it
is
to
defeat
and
where
possible
destroy
the
hostile
fleet
a
direct
protection
of
all
trade
lines
is
obviously
impossible
commerce
can
only
be
protected
indirectly
by
the
defeat
of
the
enemy
a
passive
defence
of
the
coast
can
never
count
on
permanent
success
the
american
war
of
secession
amongst
others
showed
that
sufficiently
the
object
of
our
fleet
therefore
is
to
defeat
our
possible
rivals
at
sea
and
force
them
to
make
terms
in
order
to
guarantee
unimpeded
commerce
to
our
merchantmen
and
to
protect
our
colonies
it
is
therefore
an
erroneous
idea
that
our
fleet
exists
merely
for
defence
and
must
be
built
with
that
view
it
is
intended
to
meet
our
political
needs
and
must
therefore
be
capable
of
being
employed
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
political
position
on
the
offensive
when
the
political
situation
demands
it
and
an
attack
promises
success
on
the
defensive
when
we
believe
that
more
advantages
can
be
obtained
in
this
way
at
the
present
day
indeed
the
political
grouping
of
the
great
powers
makes
a
strategical
offensive
by
sea
an
impossibility
we
must
however
reckon
with
the
future
and
then
circumstances
may
arise
which
would
render
possible
an
offensive
war
on
a
large
scale
the
strength
which
we
wish
to
give
to
our
fleet
must
therefore
be
calculated
with
regard
to
its
probable
duties
in
war
it
is
obvious
that
we
must
not
merely
consider
the
possible
opponents
who
at
the
moment
are
weaker
than
we
are
but
rather
and
principally
those
who
are
stronger
unless
we
were
in
the
position
to
avoid
a
conflict
with
them
under
all
circumstances
our
fleet
must
in
any
case
be
so
powerful
that
our
strongest
antagonist
shrinks
from
attacking
us
without
convincing
reasons
if
he
determines
to
attack
us
we
must
have
at
least
a
chance
of
victoriously
repelling
this
attack
in
other
words
of
inflicting
such
heavy
loss
on
the
enemy
that
he
will
decline
in
his
own
interests
to
carry
on
the
war
to
the
bitter
end
and
that
he
will
see
his
own
position
threatened
if
he
exposes
himself
to
these
losses
this
conception
of
our
duty
on
the
sea
points
directly
to
the
fact
that
the
english
fleet
must
set
the
standard
by
which
to
estimate
the
necessary
size
of
our
naval
preparations
a
war
with
england
is
probably
that
which
we
shall
first
have
to
fight
out
by
sea
the
possibility
of
victoriously
repelling
an
english
attack
must
be
the
guiding
principle
for
our
naval
preparations
and
if
the
english
continuously
increase
their
fleet
we
must
inevitably
follow
them
on
the
same
road
even
beyond
the
limits
of
our
present
naval
estimates
we
must
not
however
forget
that
it
will
not
be
possible
for
us
for
many
years
to
attack
on
the
open
sea
the
far
superior
english
fleet
we
may
only
hope
by
the
combination
of
the
fleet
with
the
coast
fortifications
the
airfleet
and
the
commercial
war
to
defend
ourselves
successfully
against
this
our
strongest
opponent
as
was
shown
in
the
chapter
on
the
next
naval
war
the
enemy
must
be
wearied
out
and
exhausted
by
the
enforcement
of
the
blockade
and
by
fighting
against
all
the
expedients
which
we
shall
employ
for
the
defence
of
our
coast
our
fleet
under
the
protection
of
these
expedients
will
continually
inflict
partial
losses
on
him
and
thus
gradually
we
shall
be
able
to
challenge
him
to
a
pitched
battle
on
the
high
seas
these
are
the
lines
that
our
preparation
for
war
must
follow
a
strong
coast
fortress
as
a
base
for
our
fleet
from
which
it
can
easily
and
at
any
moment
take
the
offensive
and
on
which
the
waves
of
the
hostile
superiority
can
break
harmlessly
is
the
recognized
and
necessary
preliminary
condition
for
this
class
of
war
without
such
a
trustworthy
coast
fortress
built
with
a
view
to
offensive
operations
our
fleet
could
be
closely
blockaded
by
the
enemy
and
prevented
from
any
offensive
movements
mines
alone
can
not
close
the
navigation
so
effectively
that
the
enemy
can
not
break
through
nor
can
they
keep
it
open
in
such
a
way
that
we
should
be
able
to
adopt
the
offensive
under
all
circumstances
for
this
purpose
permanent
works
are
necessary
which
command
the
navigation
and
allow
mines
to
be
placed
i
can
not
decide
the
question
whether
our
coast
defence
which
in
the
north
sea
is
concentrated
in
heligoland
and
borkum
corresponds
to
these
requirements
if
it
is
not
so
then
our
first
most
serious
duty
must
be
to
fill
up
the
existing
gaps
in
order
to
create
an
assured
base
for
our
naval
operations
this
is
a
national
duty
which
we
dare
not
evade
although
it
demands
great
sacrifices
from
us
even
the
further
development
of
our
fleet
important
as
that
is
would
sink
into
the
background
as
compared
with
the
urgency
of
this
duty
because
its
only
action
against
the
english
fleet
which
holds
out
any
prospect
of
success
presupposes
the
existence
of
some
such
fortress
but
the
question
must
be
looked
at
from
another
aspect
the
morocco
negotiations
in
the
summer
of
displayed
the
unmistakable
hostility
of
england
to
us
they
showed
that
england
is
determined
to
hinder
by
force
any
real
expansion
of
germany
power
only
the
fear
of
the
possible
intervention
of
england
deterred
us
from
claiming
a
sphere
of
interests
of
our
own
in
morocco
and
nevertheless
the
attempt
to
assert
our
unquestionable
rights
in
north
africa
provoked
menacing
utterances
from
various
english
statesmen
if
we
consider
this
behaviour
in
connection
with
england
military
preparations
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
england
seriously
contemplates
attacking
germany
should
the
occasion
arise
the
concentration
of
the
english
naval
forces
in
the
north
sea
the
feverish
haste
to
increase
the
english
fleet
the
construction
of
new
naval
stations
undisguisedly
intended
for
action
against
germany
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
the
english
lately
vigorously
practised
on
the
german
coasts
combined
with
continued
attempts
to
enlist
allies
against
us
and
to
isolate
us
in
europe
all
this
can
only
be
reasonably
interpreted
as
a
course
of
preparation
for
an
aggressive
war
at
any
rate
it
is
quite
impossible
to
regard
the
english
preparations
as
defensive
and
protective
measures
only
for
the
english
government
knows
perfectly
well
that
germany
can
not
think
of
attacking
england
such
an
attempt
would
be
objectless
from
the
first
since
the
destruction
of
the
german
naval
power
lies
in
the
distinct
interests
of
england
and
her
schemes
for
world
empire
we
must
reckon
at
least
with
the
possibility
of
an
english
attack
we
must
make
it
clear
to
ourselves
that
we
are
not
able
to
postpone
this
attack
as
we
wish
it
has
been
already
mentioned
that
the
recent
attitude
of
italy
may
precipitate
a
european
crisis
we
must
make
up
our
minds
then
that
england
will
attack
us
on
some
pretext
or
other
soon
before
the
existing
balance
of
power
which
is
very
favourable
for
england
is
shifted
possibly
to
her
disadvantage
especially
if
the
unionist
party
comes
into
power
again
must
we
reckon
upon
a
strong
english
imperial
policy
which
may
easily
bring
about
war
under
these
circumstances
we
can
not
complete
our
armament
by
sea
and
our
coast
defences
in
peaceful
leisure
in
accordance
with
theoretical
principles
on
the
contrary
we
must
strain
our
financial
resources
in
order
to
carry
on
and
if
possible
to
accelerate
the
expansion
of
our
fleet
together
with
the
fortification
of
our
coast
it
would
be
justifiable
under
the
conditions
to
meet
our
financial
requirements
by
loans
if
no
other
means
can
be
found
for
here
questions
of
the
greatest
moment
are
at
stake
questions
it
may
fairly
be
said
of
existence
let
us
imagine
the
endless
misery
which
a
protracted
stoppage
or
definite
destruction
of
our
oversea
trade
would
bring
upon
the
whole
nation
and
in
particular
on
the
masses
of
the
industrial
classes
who
live
on
our
export
trade
this
consideration
by
itself
shows
the
absolute
necessity
of
strengthening
our
naval
forces
in
combination
with
our
coast
defences
so
thoroughly
that
we
can
look
forward
to
the
decisive
campaign
with
equanimity
even
the
circumstance
that
we
can
not
perhaps
find
crews
at
once
for
the
ships
which
we
are
building
need
not
check
the
activity
of
our
dockyards
for
these
ships
will
be
valuable
to
replace
the
loss
in
vessels
which
must
occur
in
any
case
the
rapid
completion
of
the
canal
is
of
great
importance
in
order
that
our
largest
may
appear
unexpectedly
in
the
baltic
or
in
the
north
sea
but
it
does
not
meet
all
military
requirements
it
is
a
question
whether
it
is
not
expedient
to
obtain
secure
communication
by
a
canal
between
the
mouth
of
the
ems
the
bay
of
jahde
and
the
mouth
of
the
elbe
in
order
to
afford
our
fleet
more
possibilities
of
concentration
all
three
waters
form
a
in
the
north
sea
and
it
would
be
certainly
a
great
advantage
if
our
battleships
could
unexpectedly
unite
in
these
three
places
i
can
not
give
any
opinion
as
to
the
feasibility
of
this
scheme
if
it
is
feasible
we
ought
to
shirk
no
sacrifices
to
realize
it
such
a
canal
might
prove
of
decisive
value
since
our
main
prospect
of
success
depends
on
our
ability
to
break
up
the
forces
of
the
enemy
by
continuous
unexpected
attacks
and
on
our
thus
finding
an
opportunity
to
inflict
heavy
losses
upon
him
as
regards
the
development
of
the
fleet
itself
we
must
push
on
the
completion
of
our
which
consists
of
ships
of
the
line
and
the
usual
complement
of
large
cruisers
it
does
not
possess
in
its
present
condition
an
effective
value
in
proportion
to
its
numbers
there
can
be
no
doubt
on
this
point
five
of
the
ships
of
the
line
of
the
kaiser
class
are
quite
obsolete
and
the
vessels
of
the
wittelsbach
class
carry
as
heaviest
guns
only
cannons
which
must
be
considered
quite
inadequate
for
a
of
we
are
in
a
worse
plight
with
regard
to
our
large
cruisers
the
five
ships
of
the
hansa
class
have
no
fighting
value
the
three
large
cruisers
of
the
prince
class
friedrich
karl
fulfil
their
purpose
neither
in
speed
effective
range
armament
nor
even
the
armoured
cruisers
bismarck
roon
york
gneisenau
and
do
not
correspond
in
any
respect
to
modern
requirements
if
we
wish
therefore
to
be
really
ready
for
a
war
we
must
shorten
the
time
allowed
for
building
and
replace
as
rapidly
as
possible
these
totally
useless
vessels
nine
large
cruisers
and
five
battleships
by
new
and
thoroughly
effective
ships
anyone
who
regards
the
lowering
on
the
political
horizon
will
admit
this
necessity
the
english
may
storm
and
protest
ever
so
strongly
care
for
our
country
must
stand
higher
than
all
political
and
all
financial
considerations
we
must
create
new
types
of
battleships
which
may
be
superior
to
the
english
in
speed
and
fighting
qualities
that
is
no
light
task
for
the
most
modern
english
ships
of
the
line
have
reached
a
high
stage
of
perfection
and
the
newest
english
cruisers
are
little
inferior
in
fighting
value
to
the
battleships
proper
but
superiority
in
individual
units
together
with
the
greatest
possible
readiness
for
war
are
the
only
means
by
which
a
few
ships
can
be
made
to
do
at
any
rate
what
is
most
essential
since
the
krupp
guns
possess
a
certain
advantage
which
is
not
in
fact
very
great
over
the
english
heavy
naval
guns
it
is
possible
to
gain
a
start
in
this
department
and
to
equip
our
ships
with
superior
attacking
power
a
more
powerful
artillery
is
a
large
factor
in
success
which
becomes
more
marked
the
more
it
is
possible
to
distribute
the
battery
on
the
ship
in
such
a
way
that
all
the
guns
may
be
simultaneously
trained
to
either
side
or
straight
ahead
besides
the
proper
the
play
a
prominent
part
in
strategic
offence
and
defence
alike
the
therefore
especially
having
regard
to
the
crushing
superiority
of
england
requires
vigorous
encouragement
and
all
the
more
so
because
so
far
at
least
as
training
goes
we
possess
a
true
factor
of
superiority
in
them
in
we
are
thanks
to
the
high
standard
of
training
in
the
and
the
excellence
of
construction
ahead
of
all
other
navies
we
must
endeavour
to
keep
this
position
especially
as
regards
the
torpedoes
in
which
according
to
the
newspaper
accounts
other
nations
are
competing
with
us
by
trying
to
excel
us
in
range
of
the
projectile
at
high
velocity
we
must
also
devote
our
full
attention
to
submarines
and
endeavour
to
make
these
vessels
more
effective
in
attack
if
we
succeed
in
developing
this
branch
of
our
navy
so
that
it
meets
the
military
requirements
in
every
direction
and
combines
an
increased
radius
of
effectiveness
with
increased
speed
and
seaworthiness
we
shall
achieve
great
results
with
these
vessels
in
the
defence
of
our
coasts
and
in
unexpected
attacks
on
the
enemy
squadrons
a
superior
efficiency
in
this
field
would
be
extraordinarily
advantageous
to
us
last
not
least
we
must
devote
ourselves
more
energetically
to
the
development
of
aviation
for
naval
purposes
if
it
were
possible
to
make
airships
and
thoroughly
available
for
war
so
that
they
could
be
employed
in
unfavourable
weather
and
for
aggressive
purposes
they
might
render
essential
services
to
the
fleet
the
would
then
as
already
explained
in
chapter
be
able
to
report
successfully
to
spy
out
favourable
opportunities
for
attacks
by
the
or
the
and
to
give
early
notice
of
the
approach
of
the
enemy
in
superior
force
it
would
also
be
able
to
prevent
the
enemy
airships
from
reconnoitring
and
would
thus
facilitate
the
execution
of
surprise
attacks
again
it
could
repulse
or
frustrate
attacks
on
naval
depots
and
great
shipping
centres
if
our
airships
could
only
be
so
largely
developed
that
they
on
their
side
could
undertake
an
attack
and
carry
fear
and
destruction
to
the
english
coasts
they
would
lend
still
more
effective
aid
to
our
fleet
when
fighting
against
the
superior
force
of
the
enemy
it
can
hardly
be
doubted
that
technical
improvements
will
before
long
make
it
possible
to
perform
such
services
a
pronounced
superiority
of
our
over
the
english
would
contribute
largely
to
equalize
the
difference
in
strength
of
the
two
navies
more
and
more
during
the
course
of
the
war
it
should
be
the
more
possible
to
gain
a
superiority
in
this
field
because
our
supposed
enemies
have
not
any
start
on
us
and
we
can
compete
for
the
palm
of
victory
on
equal
terms
besides
the
campaign
against
the
enemy
preparations
must
be
carefully
made
in
for
the
war
on
commerce
which
would
be
especially
effective
in
a
struggle
against
england
as
that
country
needs
imports
more
than
any
other
consequently
great
results
would
follow
if
we
succeeded
in
disturbing
the
enemy
commerce
and
harassing
his
navigation
the
difficulties
of
such
an
undertaking
have
been
discussed
in
a
previous
chapter
it
is
all
the
more
imperative
to
organize
our
preparations
in
such
a
way
that
the
swift
ships
intended
for
the
commercial
war
should
be
able
to
reach
their
scene
of
activity
unexpectedly
before
the
enemy
has
been
able
to
block
our
harbours
the
auxiliary
cruisers
must
be
so
equipped
in
that
when
on
the
open
sea
they
may
assume
the
character
of
warships
at
a
moment
notice
when
ordered
by
wireless
telegraphy
to
do
so
a
rapid
mobilization
is
especially
important
in
the
navy
since
we
must
be
ready
for
a
sudden
attack
at
any
time
possibly
in
time
of
peace
history
tells
us
what
to
expect
from
the
english
on
this
head
in
the
middle
of
peace
they
bombarded
copenhagen
from
september
to
september
and
carried
off
the
danish
fleet
four
hundred
houses
were
burnt
damaged
peaceful
and
innocent
inhabitants
were
killed
if
some
explanation
though
no
justification
of
the
conduct
of
england
is
seen
in
the
lawlessness
of
all
conditions
then
existing
and
in
the
equally
ruthless
acts
of
napoleon
still
the
occurrence
shows
distinctly
of
what
measures
england
is
capable
if
her
command
of
the
seas
is
endangered
and
this
practice
has
not
been
forgotten
on
july
and
exactly
thirty
years
ago
alexandria
was
similarly
bombarded
in
and
egypt
occupied
by
the
english
under
the
hypocritical
pretext
that
arabi
pasha
had
ordered
a
massacre
of
the
foreigners
the
language
of
such
historical
facts
is
clear
it
is
well
not
to
forget
them
the
war
also
is
a
warning
how
modern
wars
begin
so
also
italy
with
her
political
and
military
attack
on
turkey
turkish
ships
suspecting
nothing
of
war
were
attacked
and
captured
by
the
italians
now
it
must
not
be
denied
that
such
a
method
of
opening
a
campaign
as
was
adopted
by
japan
and
italy
may
be
justified
under
certain
conditions
the
interests
of
the
state
may
turn
the
scale
the
brutal
violence
shown
to
a
weak
opponent
such
as
is
displayed
in
the
english
procedure
has
nothing
in
common
with
a
course
of
action
politically
justifiable
a
surprise
attack
in
order
to
be
justified
must
be
made
in
the
first
place
only
on
the
armed
forces
of
the
hostile
state
not
on
peaceful
inhabitants
a
further
necessary
preliminary
condition
is
that
the
tension
of
the
political
situation
brings
the
possibility
or
probability
of
a
war
clearly
before
the
eyes
of
both
parties
so
that
an
expectation
of
and
preparations
for
war
can
be
assumed
otherwise
the
attack
becomes
a
treacherous
crime
if
the
required
preliminary
conditions
are
granted
then
a
political
is
as
justifiable
as
a
surprise
attack
in
warfare
since
it
tries
to
derive
advantage
from
an
unwarrantable
carelessness
of
the
opponent
a
definite
principle
of
right
can
never
be
formulated
in
this
question
since
everything
depends
on
the
views
taken
of
the
position
and
these
may
be
very
divergent
among
the
parties
concerned
history
alone
can
pass
a
final
verdict
on
the
conduct
of
states
but
in
no
case
can
a
formal
rule
of
right
in
such
cases
especially
when
a
question
of
life
or
death
is
depending
on
it
as
was
literally
the
fact
in
the
manchurian
war
as
regards
japan
limit
the
undoubted
right
of
the
state
if
japan
had
not
obtained
from
the
very
first
the
absolute
command
of
the
seas
the
war
with
russia
would
have
been
hopeless
she
was
justified
therefore
in
employing
the
most
extreme
measures
no
such
interests
were
at
stake
for
england
either
in
or
and
italy
proceedings
in
are
certainly
doubtful
from
the
standpoint
of
political
morality
these
examples
however
show
what
we
may
expect
from
england
and
we
must
be
the
more
prepared
to
find
her
using
this
right
to
attack
without
warning
since
we
also
may
be
under
the
necessity
of
using
this
right
our
mobilization
preparations
must
therefore
be
ready
for
all
such
eventualities
especially
in
the
period
after
the
dismissal
of
the
reservists
public
policy
forbids
any
discussion
of
the
steps
that
must
be
taken
to
secure
that
our
fleet
is
ready
for
war
during
this
time
under
all
circumstances
however
our
coast
defences
must
be
continuously
ready
for
fighting
and
permanently
garrisoned
in
times
of
political
tension
the
mines
must
also
be
prepared
for
action
without
delay
the
whole
requisite
for
the
purpose
must
be
on
the
spot
ready
for
instant
use
so
too
all
measures
for
the
protection
of
commerce
at
the
mouths
of
our
rivers
and
in
the
kaiser
wilhelm
canal
must
be
put
in
force
directly
the
situation
becomes
strained
this
is
a
mere
simple
precept
of
we
must
also
attach
as
much
importance
to
the
observation
and
intelligence
service
on
our
coasts
in
as
is
done
in
england
when
we
realize
in
their
entirety
the
mass
of
preparations
which
are
required
for
the
maintenance
of
our
place
among
the
great
powers
by
the
navy
we
see
that
extraordinarily
exacting
demands
will
be
made
on
the
resources
of
our
people
these
weigh
the
heavier
for
the
moment
since
the
crisis
of
the
hour
forces
us
to
quite
exceptional
exertions
and
the
expenditure
on
the
fleet
must
go
with
very
energetic
preparations
on
land
if
we
do
not
possess
the
strength
or
the
to
meet
this
twofold
demand
the
increase
of
the
fleet
must
be
delayed
and
we
must
restrict
ourselves
to
bringing
our
coast
defences
to
such
a
pitch
of
completeness
as
will
meet
all
our
requirements
any
acceleration
in
our
would
have
to
be
provisionally
dropped
in
opposition
to
this
view
it
is
urged
from
one
quarter
that
we
should
limit
our
fortification
of
the
coast
to
what
is
absolutely
necessary
devote
our
means
to
developing
the
fleet
and
lay
the
greatest
stress
on
the
number
of
the
ships
and
their
readiness
for
war
even
in
case
of
the
reserve
fleet
this
view
starts
from
the
presupposition
that
in
face
of
so
strong
and
a
fleet
as
the
naval
act
contemplates
for
germany
england
would
never
resolve
to
declare
war
on
us
it
is
also
safe
to
assume
that
a
fleet
built
expressly
on
uniform
tactical
principles
represents
a
more
powerful
fighting
force
than
we
have
in
an
equal
number
of
heterogeneous
battleships
i
can
not
myself
however
endorse
this
view
on
the
one
hand
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
fighting
strength
of
the
hostile
fleets
increases
quicker
than
that
of
ours
on
the
other
hand
i
believe
that
the
general
situation
makes
war
with
england
inevitable
even
if
our
naval
force
in
the
shortest
time
reaches
its
statutory
strength
in
modern
my
view
therefore
is
that
we
must
first
of
all
lay
the
solid
foundation
without
which
any
successful
action
against
the
superior
forces
of
the
enemy
is
unthinkable
should
the
coast
fortifications
fail
to
do
what
is
expected
from
them
success
is
quite
impossible
it
is
however
all
the
more
our
duty
to
spare
no
sacrifices
to
carry
out
objects
the
enlargement
of
the
fleet
as
well
as
whatever
may
still
be
necessary
to
the
perfecting
of
our
coast
defences
though
this
latter
point
calls
for
the
first
attention
the
great
necessity
for
the
navy
admits
of
no
doubt
if
we
do
not
stake
everything
on
strengthening
our
fleet
to
insure
at
least
the
possibility
of
a
successful
war
and
if
we
once
more
allow
our
probable
opponent
to
gain
a
start
which
it
will
be
scarcely
possible
to
make
up
in
the
future
we
must
renounce
for
many
years
to
come
any
place
among
the
world
powers
under
these
circumstances
no
one
who
cherishes
german
sentiments
and
german
hopes
will
advocate
a
policy
of
renunciation
on
the
contrary
we
must
try
not
only
to
prosecute
simultaneously
the
fortification
of
the
coast
and
the
development
of
the
fleet
but
we
must
so
accelerate
the
pace
of
our
that
the
requirements
of
the
naval
act
will
be
met
by
a
result
quite
possible
according
to
expert
opinion
the
difficult
plight
in
which
we
are
as
regards
our
readiness
for
war
is
due
to
two
causes
in
the
past
it
has
been
produced
in
the
first
place
because
from
love
of
the
pleasures
of
peace
we
have
in
the
long
years
since
the
founding
of
the
german
empire
neglected
to
define
and
strengthen
our
place
among
the
powers
of
europe
and
to
win
a
free
hand
in
world
politics
while
around
us
the
other
powers
were
growing
more
and
more
threatening
it
was
in
my
opinion
the
most
serious
mistake
in
german
policy
that
a
final
settling
of
accounts
with
france
was
not
effected
at
a
time
when
the
state
of
international
affairs
was
favourable
and
success
might
confidently
have
been
expected
there
has
indeed
been
no
lack
of
opportunities
we
have
only
our
policy
of
peace
and
renunciation
to
thank
for
the
fact
that
we
are
placed
in
this
difficult
position
and
are
confronted
by
the
momentous
choice
between
resigning
all
claim
to
world
power
or
disputing
this
claim
against
numerically
superior
enemies
this
policy
somewhat
resembles
the
supineness
for
which
england
has
herself
to
blame
when
she
refused
her
assistance
to
the
southern
states
in
the
american
war
of
secession
and
thus
allowed
a
power
to
arise
in
the
form
of
the
united
states
of
north
america
which
already
although
barely
fifty
years
have
elapsed
threatens
england
own
position
as
a
world
power
but
the
consequences
of
our
peace
policy
hit
us
harder
than
england
has
suffered
under
her
former
american
policy
the
place
of
great
britain
as
a
great
power
is
far
more
secured
by
her
insular
position
and
her
command
of
the
seas
than
ours
which
is
threatened
on
all
sides
by
more
powerful
enemies
it
is
true
that
one
can
not
anticipate
success
in
any
war
with
certainty
and
there
was
always
the
possibility
during
the
past
forty
years
that
we
might
not
succeed
in
conquering
france
as
effectually
as
we
would
have
wished
this
uncertainty
is
inseparable
from
every
war
neither
in
nor
in
could
bismarck
foresee
the
degree
of
success
which
would
fall
to
him
but
he
dared
to
fight
the
greatness
of
the
statesman
is
shown
when
at
the
most
favourable
moment
he
has
the
courage
to
undertake
what
is
the
necessary
and
according
to
human
calculation
the
best
course
just
fate
decides
the
issue
the
second
cause
of
our
present
position
is
to
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
we
started
to
build
our
fleet
too
late
the
chief
mistake
which
we
have
made
is
that
after
the
year
when
we
roused
ourselves
to
vote
the
brandenburg
type
of
ship
we
sank
back
until
into
a
period
of
decadence
while
complete
lack
of
system
prevailed
in
all
matters
concerning
the
fleet
we
have
also
begun
far
too
late
to
develop
systematically
our
coast
defences
so
that
the
most
essential
duties
which
spring
out
of
the
political
situation
are
unfulfilled
since
we
have
not
foreseen
this
situation
nor
prepared
for
it
this
experience
must
be
a
lesson
to
us
in
the
future
we
must
never
let
the
petty
cares
and
needs
of
the
moment
blind
us
to
the
broad
views
which
must
determine
our
world
policy
we
must
always
adopt
in
good
time
those
measures
which
are
seen
to
be
necessary
for
the
future
even
though
they
make
heavy
financial
calls
on
our
resources
this
is
the
point
of
view
that
we
must
keep
in
mind
with
regard
to
our
naval
armament
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
we
may
make
up
a
little
for
lost
time
it
will
be
a
heinous
mistake
if
we
do
not
perform
this
duty
devotedly
chapter
xiii
the
army
and
popular
education
the
policy
of
peace
and
restraint
has
brought
us
to
a
position
in
which
we
can
only
assert
our
place
among
the
great
powers
and
secure
the
conditions
of
life
for
the
future
by
the
greatest
expenditure
of
treasure
and
so
far
as
human
conjecture
can
go
of
blood
we
shall
be
compelled
therefore
to
adopt
without
a
moment
delay
special
measures
which
will
enable
us
to
be
more
or
less
a
match
for
our
enemies
i
mean
accelerated
and
rapid
increase
of
the
army
we
must
always
bear
in
mind
in
the
present
that
we
have
to
provide
for
the
future
apart
from
the
requirements
of
the
moment
we
must
never
forget
to
develop
the
elements
on
which
not
only
our
military
strength
but
also
the
political
power
of
the
state
ultimately
rest
we
must
maintain
the
physical
and
mental
health
of
the
nation
and
this
can
only
be
done
if
we
aim
at
a
progressive
development
of
popular
education
in
the
widest
sense
corresponding
to
the
external
changes
in
the
conditions
and
demands
of
existence
while
it
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
guide
her
citizens
to
the
highest
moral
and
mental
development
on
the
other
hand
the
elements
of
strength
rooted
in
the
people
react
upon
the
efficiency
of
the
state
only
when
supported
by
the
strong
unanimous
will
of
the
nation
can
the
state
achieve
really
great
results
she
is
therefore
doubly
interested
in
promoting
the
physical
and
mental
growth
of
the
nation
her
duty
and
her
justification
consist
in
this
endeavour
for
she
draws
from
the
fulfilment
of
this
duty
the
strength
and
capacity
to
be
in
the
highest
sense
true
to
it
it
is
under
present
conditions
expedient
also
from
the
merely
military
standpoint
to
provide
not
only
for
the
healthy
physical
development
of
our
growing
youth
but
also
to
raise
its
intellectual
level
for
while
the
demands
which
modern
war
makes
have
increased
in
every
direction
the
term
of
service
has
been
shortened
in
order
to
make
enlistment
in
very
great
numbers
possible
thus
the
full
consummation
of
military
training
can
not
be
attained
unless
recruits
enter
the
army
well
equipped
physically
and
mentally
and
bringing
with
them
patriotic
sentiments
worthy
of
the
honourable
profession
of
arms
we
have
already
shown
in
a
previous
chapter
how
important
it
is
to
raise
the
culture
of
the
officers
and
officers
to
the
best
of
our
power
in
order
to
secure
not
only
a
greater
and
more
independent
individual
efficiency
but
also
a
deeper
and
more
lasting
influence
on
the
men
but
this
influence
of
the
superiors
must
always
remain
limited
if
it
can
not
count
on
finding
in
the
men
a
receptive
and
intelligent
material
this
fact
is
especially
clear
when
we
grasp
the
claims
which
modern
war
will
make
on
the
individual
fighter
in
order
to
meet
these
demands
fully
the
people
must
be
properly
educated
each
individual
must
in
modern
warfare
display
a
large
measure
of
independent
judgment
calm
grasp
of
the
facts
and
bold
resolution
in
the
open
methods
of
fighting
the
infantryman
after
his
appointed
duty
has
been
assigned
him
is
to
a
great
degree
thrown
on
his
own
resources
he
may
often
have
to
take
over
the
command
of
his
own
section
if
the
losses
among
his
superiors
are
heavy
the
artilleryman
will
have
to
work
his
gun
when
the
section
leaders
and
gun
captains
have
fallen
victims
to
the
shrapnel
fire
the
patrols
and
are
often
left
to
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
enemy
country
and
the
sapper
who
is
working
against
a
will
often
find
himself
unexpectedly
face
to
face
with
the
enemy
and
has
no
resource
left
beyond
his
own
professional
knowledge
and
determination
but
not
only
are
higher
claims
made
on
the
independent
responsibility
of
the
individual
in
modern
warfare
but
the
strain
on
the
physique
will
probably
be
far
greater
in
the
future
than
in
previous
wars
this
change
is
due
partly
to
the
large
size
of
the
armies
partly
to
the
greater
efficiency
of
the
firearms
all
movements
in
large
masses
are
more
exacting
in
themselves
than
similar
movements
in
small
detachments
since
they
are
never
carried
out
so
smoothly
the
shelter
and
food
of
great
masses
can
never
be
so
good
as
with
smaller
bodies
the
depth
of
the
marching
columns
which
increases
with
the
masses
adds
to
the
difficulties
of
any
movements
abbreviated
rest
at
night
irregular
hours
for
meals
unusual
times
for
marching
etc
the
increased
range
of
modern
firearms
extends
the
actual
fighting
zone
and
in
combination
with
the
larger
fronts
necessitates
wide
détours
whenever
the
troops
attempt
enveloping
movements
or
other
changes
of
position
on
the
battlefield
in
the
face
of
these
higher
demands
the
amount
of
work
done
in
the
army
has
been
enormously
increased
the
state
however
has
done
little
to
prepare
our
young
men
better
for
military
service
while
tendencies
are
making
themselves
felt
in
the
life
of
the
people
which
exercise
a
very
detrimental
influence
on
their
education
i
specially
refer
to
the
encroachments
of
a
feeling
and
with
this
the
flocking
of
the
population
into
the
large
towns
which
is
unfavourable
to
physical
development
this
result
is
clearly
shown
by
the
enlistment
statistics
at
the
present
day
out
of
all
the
military
units
over
per
cent
come
from
the
large
towns
per
cent
from
the
towns
per
cent
from
the
small
or
country
towns
and
per
cent
from
the
rural
districts
while
the
distribution
of
the
population
between
town
and
country
is
quite
different
according
to
the
census
of
the
rural
population
amounted
to
per
the
small
or
country
towns
to
per
the
towns
to
per
and
the
large
towns
to
per
cent
of
the
entire
number
of
inhabitants
the
proportion
has
probably
changed
since
that
year
still
more
unfavourably
for
the
rural
population
while
the
large
towns
have
increased
in
population
these
figures
clearly
show
the
physical
deterioration
of
the
town
population
and
signify
a
danger
to
our
national
life
not
merely
in
respect
of
physique
but
in
the
intellect
and
compact
unity
of
the
nation
the
rural
population
forms
part
and
parcel
of
the
army
a
thousand
bonds
unite
the
troops
and
the
families
of
their
members
so
far
as
they
come
from
the
country
everyone
who
studies
the
inner
life
of
our
army
is
aware
of
this
the
interest
felt
in
the
soldier
life
is
intense
it
is
the
same
spirit
transmitted
from
one
to
another
the
relation
of
the
army
to
the
population
of
the
great
cities
which
send
a
small
and
fraction
of
their
sons
into
the
army
is
quite
different
a
certain
opposition
exists
between
the
population
of
the
great
cities
and
the
who
from
a
military
point
of
view
form
the
backbone
of
the
nation
similarly
the
links
between
the
army
and
the
large
towns
have
loosened
and
large
sections
of
the
population
in
the
great
cities
are
absolutely
hostile
to
the
service
it
is
in
the
direct
interests
of
the
state
to
raise
the
physical
health
of
the
town
population
by
all
imaginable
means
not
only
in
order
to
enable
more
soldiers
to
be
enlisted
but
to
bring
the
beneficial
effect
of
military
training
more
extensively
to
bear
on
the
town
population
and
so
to
help
to
make
our
social
conditions
more
healthy
nothing
promotes
unity
of
spirit
and
sentiment
like
the
comradeship
of
military
service
so
far
as
i
can
judge
it
is
not
factory
work
alone
in
itself
which
exercises
a
detrimental
effect
on
the
physical
development
and
owing
to
its
monotony
on
the
mental
development
also
but
the
general
conditions
of
life
inseparable
from
such
work
are
prejudicial
apart
from
many
forms
of
employment
in
factories
which
are
directly
injurious
to
health
the
factors
which
stunt
physical
development
may
be
found
in
the
housing
conditions
in
the
town
life
and
in
alcoholism
this
latter
vice
is
far
more
prevalent
in
the
large
cities
than
in
the
rural
districts
and
in
combination
with
the
other
influences
of
the
great
city
produces
far
more
harmful
results
it
is
therefore
the
unmistakable
duty
of
the
state
first
to
fight
alcoholism
with
every
weapon
if
necessary
by
relentlessly
taxing
all
kinds
of
alcoholic
drinks
and
by
strictly
limiting
the
right
to
sell
them
secondly
most
emphatic
encouragement
must
be
given
to
all
efforts
to
improve
the
housing
conditions
of
the
working
population
and
to
withdraw
the
youth
of
the
towns
from
the
ruinous
influences
of
a
life
of
amusements
in
munich
bavarian
officers
have
recently
made
a
praiseworthy
attempt
to
occupy
the
leisure
time
of
the
young
men
past
the
age
of
attendance
at
school
with
military
exercises
the
young
men
clubs
which
goltz
is
trying
to
establish
aim
at
similar
objects
such
undertakings
ought
to
be
vigorously
carried
out
in
every
large
town
and
supported
by
the
state
from
purely
physical
as
well
as
social
considerations
the
gymnastic
instruction
in
the
schools
and
gymnastic
clubs
has
an
undoubtedly
beneficial
effect
on
physical
development
and
deserves
every
encouragement
finally
on
these
grounds
as
well
as
all
others
the
system
of
universal
service
should
have
been
made
an
effective
reality
it
is
literally
amazing
to
notice
the
excellent
effect
of
military
service
on
the
physical
development
of
the
recruits
the
authorities
in
charge
of
the
reserves
should
have
been
instructed
to
make
the
population
of
the
great
cities
serve
in
larger
numbers
than
hitherto
on
the
other
hand
a
warning
must
in
my
opinion
be
issued
against
two
tendencies
first
against
the
continual
curtailing
of
the
working
hours
for
factory
hands
and
artisans
and
secondly
against
crediting
sport
with
an
exaggerated
value
for
the
national
health
as
already
pointed
out
it
is
usually
not
the
work
itself
but
the
circumstances
attendant
on
working
together
in
large
numbers
that
are
prejudicial
the
wish
to
shorten
the
working
hours
on
principle
except
to
a
moderate
degree
unless
any
exceptionally
unfavourable
conditions
of
work
are
present
is
in
my
opinion
an
immoral
endeavour
and
a
complete
miscomprehension
of
the
real
value
of
work
it
is
in
itself
the
greatest
blessing
which
man
knows
and
ill
betide
the
nation
which
regards
it
no
longer
as
a
moral
duty
but
as
the
necessary
means
of
earning
a
livelihood
and
paying
for
amusements
strenuous
labour
alone
produces
men
and
characters
and
those
nations
who
have
been
compelled
to
win
their
living
in
a
continuous
struggle
against
a
rude
climate
have
often
achieved
the
greatest
exploits
and
shown
the
greatest
vitality
so
long
as
the
dutch
steeled
their
strength
by
unremitting
conflict
with
the
sea
so
long
as
they
fought
for
religious
liberty
against
the
spanish
supremacy
they
were
a
nation
of
historical
importance
now
when
they
live
mainly
for
and
enjoyment
and
lead
a
politically
neutral
existence
without
great
ambitions
or
great
wars
their
importance
has
sunk
low
and
will
not
rise
again
until
they
take
a
part
in
the
struggle
of
the
civilized
nations
in
germany
that
stock
which
was
destined
to
bring
back
our
country
from
degradation
to
historical
importance
did
not
grow
up
on
the
fertile
banks
of
the
rhine
or
the
danube
but
on
the
sterile
sands
of
the
march
we
must
preserve
the
stern
industrious
feeling
and
carry
the
rest
of
germany
with
us
to
kant
conception
of
life
we
must
continuously
steel
our
strength
by
great
political
and
economic
endeavours
and
must
not
be
content
with
what
we
have
already
attained
or
abandon
ourselves
to
the
indolent
pursuit
of
pleasure
thus
only
we
shall
remain
healthy
in
mind
and
body
and
able
to
keep
our
place
in
the
world
where
nature
herself
does
not
compel
hard
toil
or
where
with
growing
wealth
wide
sections
of
the
people
are
inclined
to
follow
a
life
of
pleasure
rather
than
of
work
society
and
the
state
must
vie
in
taking
care
that
work
does
not
become
play
or
play
work
it
is
work
regarded
as
a
duty
that
forges
men
not
fanciful
play
sport
which
is
spreading
more
and
more
amongst
us
too
must
always
remain
a
means
of
recreation
not
an
end
in
itself
if
it
is
to
be
justified
at
all
we
must
never
forget
this
hard
laborious
work
has
made
germany
great
in
england
on
the
contrary
sport
has
succeeded
in
maintaining
the
physical
health
of
the
nation
but
by
becoming
exaggerated
and
by
usurping
the
place
of
serious
work
it
has
greatly
injured
the
english
nation
the
english
nation
under
the
influence
of
growing
wealth
a
lower
standard
of
labour
efficiency
which
indeed
is
the
avowed
object
of
the
english
trades
unions
and
of
the
security
of
its
military
position
has
more
and
more
become
a
nation
of
gentlemen
at
ease
and
of
sportsmen
and
it
may
well
be
asked
whether
under
these
conditions
england
will
show
herself
competent
for
the
great
duties
which
she
has
taken
on
herself
in
the
future
if
further
the
political
rivalry
with
the
great
and
ambitious
republic
in
america
be
removed
by
an
arbitration
treaty
this
circumstance
might
easily
become
the
where
the
roads
to
progress
and
to
decadence
divide
in
spite
of
all
sports
which
develop
physique
the
physical
healthiness
of
a
nation
has
no
permanent
value
unless
it
comes
from
work
and
goes
with
spiritual
development
while
if
the
latter
is
subordinated
to
material
and
physical
considerations
the
result
must
be
injurious
in
the
we
must
not
therefore
be
content
to
educate
up
for
the
army
a
physically
healthy
set
of
young
men
by
elevating
the
social
conditions
and
the
whole
method
of
life
of
our
people
but
we
must
also
endeavour
to
promote
their
spiritual
development
in
every
way
the
means
for
doing
so
is
the
school
military
education
under
the
conditions
which
are
continually
becoming
more
severe
can
only
realize
its
aims
satisfactorily
if
a
groundwork
has
been
laid
for
it
in
the
schools
and
an
improved
preliminary
training
has
been
given
to
the
raw
material
the
national
school
is
not
sufficient
for
this
requirement
the
general
regulations
which
settle
the
national
school
system
in
prussia
date
from
the
year
and
are
thus
forty
years
old
and
do
not
take
account
of
the
modern
development
which
has
been
so
rapid
of
late
years
it
is
only
natural
that
a
fundamental
opposition
exists
between
them
and
the
essentials
of
military
education
military
education
requires
complete
individualization
and
a
conscious
development
of
manly
feeling
in
the
national
school
everything
is
based
on
teaching
in
classes
and
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
sexes
this
is
directly
prescribed
by
the
rules
in
the
army
the
recruits
are
taught
under
the
superintendence
of
the
superiors
by
specially
detached
officers
and
selected
experienced
officers
and
even
instruction
is
given
them
in
quite
small
sections
while
each
one
receives
individual
attention
from
the
officers
of
his
section
and
the
higher
superior
officers
in
a
school
on
the
contrary
the
master
is
expected
to
teach
as
many
as
eighty
scholars
at
a
time
in
a
school
with
two
teachers
as
many
as
children
are
divided
into
two
classes
a
separation
of
the
sexes
is
only
recommended
in
a
school
of
several
classes
as
a
rule
therefore
the
instruction
is
given
in
common
it
is
certain
that
under
such
conditions
no
insight
into
the
personality
of
the
individual
is
possible
all
that
is
achieved
is
to
impart
more
or
less
mechanically
and
inefficiently
a
certain
amount
of
information
in
some
branch
of
knowledge
without
any
consideration
of
the
special
dispositions
of
boys
and
girls
still
less
of
individuals
such
a
national
school
can
obviously
offer
no
preparation
for
a
military
education
the
principles
which
regulate
the
teaching
in
the
two
places
are
quite
different
that
is
seen
in
the
whole
tendency
of
the
instruction
the
military
education
aims
at
training
the
moral
personality
to
independent
thought
and
action
and
at
the
same
time
rousing
patriotic
feelings
among
the
men
instruction
in
a
sense
of
duty
and
in
our
national
history
thus
takes
a
foremost
place
by
the
side
of
professional
teaching
great
attention
is
given
to
educate
each
individual
in
logical
reasoning
and
in
the
clear
expression
of
his
thoughts
in
the
national
school
these
views
are
completely
relegated
to
the
background
not
of
course
as
a
matter
of
intention
and
theory
but
as
the
practical
result
of
the
conditions
the
chief
stress
in
such
a
school
is
laid
on
formal
religious
instruction
and
on
imparting
some
facility
in
reading
writing
and
ciphering
the
history
geography
natural
history
natural
science
fall
quite
into
the
background
only
six
out
of
thirty
hours
of
instruction
weekly
are
devoted
to
all
the
in
the
middle
and
upper
standards
in
the
lower
standards
they
are
ignored
altogether
while
four
to
five
hours
are
assigned
to
religious
instruction
in
every
standard
there
is
no
idea
of
any
deliberate
encouragement
of
patriotism
not
a
word
in
the
general
regulations
suggests
that
any
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
this
and
while
over
two
pages
are
filled
with
details
of
the
methods
of
religious
instruction
history
which
is
especially
valuable
for
the
development
of
patriotic
sentiments
is
dismissed
in
ten
lines
as
for
influencing
the
character
and
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
scholars
to
any
extent
worth
mentioning
the
system
of
large
classes
puts
it
altogether
out
of
the
question
while
the
allotment
of
subjects
to
the
hours
available
for
instruction
is
thus
very
the
system
on
which
instruction
is
given
especially
in
religious
matters
is
also
unsatisfactory
beginning
with
the
lower
standard
onwards
that
is
to
say
the
children
of
six
years
stories
not
only
from
the
new
testament
but
also
from
the
old
testament
are
drummed
into
the
heads
of
the
scholars
similarly
every
saturday
the
portions
of
scripture
appointed
for
the
next
sunday
are
read
out
and
explained
to
all
the
children
instruction
in
the
catechism
begins
also
in
the
lower
standard
from
the
age
of
six
onwards
the
children
must
learn
some
twenty
hymns
by
heart
besides
various
prayers
it
is
a
significant
fact
that
it
has
been
found
necessary
expressly
to
forbid
the
memorizing
of
the
general
confession
and
other
parts
of
the
liturgical
service
as
also
the
learning
by
heart
of
the
pericopes
on
the
other
hand
the
institution
of
public
worship
is
to
be
explained
to
the
children
this
illustrates
the
spirit
in
which
this
instruction
has
to
be
imparted
according
to
the
regulations
it
is
really
amazing
to
read
these
regulations
the
object
of
evangelical
religious
instruction
is
to
introduce
the
children
to
the
comprehension
of
the
holy
scriptures
and
to
the
creed
of
the
congregation
in
order
that
they
may
be
enabled
to
read
the
scriptures
independently
and
to
take
an
active
part
both
in
the
life
and
the
religious
worship
of
the
congregation
requirements
are
laid
down
which
entirely
abandon
the
task
of
making
the
subject
suitable
to
the
comprehension
of
children
from
six
to
fourteen
years
of
age
and
presuppose
a
range
of
ideas
totally
beyond
their
age
not
a
word
however
suggests
that
the
real
meaning
of
religion
its
influence
that
is
on
the
moral
conduct
of
man
should
be
adequately
brought
into
prominence
the
teacher
is
not
urged
by
a
single
syllable
to
impress
religious
ideas
on
the
receptive
the
whole
course
of
instruction
in
conformity
with
regulations
deals
with
a
formal
religiosity
which
is
quite
out
of
touch
with
practical
life
and
if
not
deliberately
at
least
in
result
renounces
any
attempt
at
moral
influence
a
real
feeling
for
religion
is
seldom
the
fruit
of
such
instruction
the
children
as
a
rule
are
glad
after
their
confirmation
to
have
done
with
this
unspiritual
religious
teaching
and
so
they
remain
when
their
schooling
is
over
permanently
strangers
to
the
religious
inner
life
which
the
instruction
never
awakened
in
them
nor
does
the
instruction
for
confirmation
do
much
to
alter
that
for
it
is
usually
conceived
in
the
same
spirit
all
other
subjects
which
might
raise
heart
and
spirit
and
present
to
the
young
minds
some
high
ideals
more
especially
our
own
history
are
most
shamefully
neglected
in
favour
of
this
sort
of
instruction
and
yet
a
truly
religious
and
patriotic
spirit
is
of
inestimable
value
for
life
and
above
all
for
the
soldier
it
is
the
more
regrettable
that
instruction
in
the
national
school
as
fixed
by
the
regulations
and
as
given
in
practice
in
a
still
duller
form
is
totally
unfitted
to
raise
such
feelings
and
thus
to
do
some
real
service
to
the
country
it
is
quite
refreshing
to
read
in
the
new
regulations
for
middle
schools
of
february
that
by
religious
instruction
the
moral
and
religious
tendencies
of
the
child
should
be
awakened
and
strengthened
and
that
the
teaching
of
history
should
aim
at
exciting
an
intelligent
appreciation
of
the
greatness
of
the
fatherland
the
method
of
religious
instruction
which
is
adopted
in
the
national
school
is
in
my
opinion
hopelessly
perverted
religious
instruction
can
only
become
fruitful
and
profitable
when
a
certain
intellectual
growth
has
started
and
the
child
possesses
some
conscious
will
to
make
it
the
basis
of
intellectual
growth
as
was
evidently
intended
in
the
national
schools
has
never
been
a
success
for
it
ought
not
to
be
directed
at
the
understanding
and
logical
faculties
but
at
the
mystical
intuitions
of
the
soul
and
if
it
is
begun
too
early
it
has
a
confusing
effect
on
the
development
of
the
mental
faculties
even
the
missionary
who
wishes
to
achieve
real
results
tries
to
educate
his
pupils
by
work
and
secular
instruction
before
he
attempts
to
impart
to
them
subtle
religious
ideas
yet
every
saturday
the
appointed
passages
of
scripture
the
pericopes
are
explained
to
children
religious
instruction
proper
ought
to
begin
in
the
middle
standard
up
to
that
point
the
teacher
should
be
content
from
the
religious
standpoint
to
work
on
the
child
imagination
and
feelings
with
the
simplest
ideas
of
the
deity
but
in
other
respects
to
endeavour
to
awaken
and
encourage
the
intellectual
life
and
make
it
able
to
grasp
loftier
conceptions
the
national
school
stands
in
total
contradiction
to
this
intellectual
development
this
is
in
conformity
to
regulations
for
the
same
children
who
read
the
bible
independently
are
only
to
be
led
to
an
approximate
comprehension
of
those
phenomena
which
are
daily
around
them
in
the
course
of
eight
years
they
learn
a
smattering
of
reading
writing
and
ciphering
a
it
is
significant
of
the
knowledge
of
our
national
history
which
the
school
imparts
that
out
of
recruits
of
one
company
to
whom
the
question
was
put
who
bismarck
was
not
a
single
one
could
answer
that
the
scholars
acquire
even
a
general
idea
of
their
duties
to
the
country
and
the
state
is
quite
out
of
the
question
it
is
impossible
to
rouse
the
affection
and
fancy
of
the
children
by
instruction
in
history
because
the
two
sexes
are
taught
in
common
one
thing
appeals
to
the
heart
of
boys
another
to
those
of
girls
and
although
i
consider
it
important
that
patriotic
feelings
should
be
inculcated
among
girls
since
as
mothers
they
will
transmit
them
to
the
family
still
the
girls
must
be
influenced
in
a
different
way
from
the
boys
when
the
instruction
is
common
to
both
the
treatment
of
the
subject
by
the
teacher
remains
neutral
and
colourless
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
how
such
great
results
are
expected
in
the
religious
field
when
so
little
has
been
achieved
in
every
other
field
this
pedantic
school
has
wandered
far
indeed
from
the
ideal
that
frederick
the
great
set
up
he
declared
that
the
duty
of
the
state
was
to
educate
the
young
generation
to
independent
thinking
and
love
of
country
footnote
a
recently
a
boy
was
discharged
from
a
national
school
as
an
exceptionally
good
scholar
and
was
sent
as
well
qualified
to
the
office
of
a
head
forester
he
showed
that
he
could
not
copy
correctly
to
say
nothing
of
writing
by
himself
our
national
school
of
needs
then
searching
and
thorough
reform
if
it
is
to
be
a
preparatory
school
not
only
for
military
education
but
for
life
generally
it
sends
children
out
into
the
world
with
undeveloped
reasoning
faculties
and
equipped
with
the
barest
elements
of
knowledge
and
thus
makes
them
not
only
void
of
but
easy
victims
of
all
the
corrupting
influences
of
social
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
mind
and
reasoning
faculties
of
the
national
schoolboy
are
developed
for
the
first
time
by
his
course
of
instruction
as
a
recruit
it
is
obviously
not
my
business
to
indicate
the
paths
to
such
a
reform
i
will
only
suggest
the
points
which
seem
to
me
the
most
important
from
the
standpoint
of
a
citizen
and
a
soldier
first
and
foremost
the
instruction
must
be
more
individual
the
number
of
teachers
accordingly
must
be
increased
and
that
of
scholars
diminished
it
is
worth
while
considering
in
this
connection
the
feasibility
of
beginning
school
instruction
at
the
age
of
eight
years
then
all
teaching
must
be
directed
more
than
at
present
to
the
object
of
developing
the
children
minds
and
formal
religious
instruction
should
only
begin
in
due
harmony
with
intellectual
progress
finally
the
especially
the
history
of
our
own
country
should
claim
more
attention
and
patriotic
feelings
should
be
encouraged
in
every
way
while
in
religious
instruction
the
moral
influence
of
religion
should
be
more
prominent
than
the
formal
contents
the
training
of
the
national
school
teacher
must
be
placed
on
a
new
basis
at
present
it
absolutely
corresponds
to
the
and
limited
standpoint
of
the
school
itself
and
does
not
enable
the
teachers
to
develop
the
minds
and
feelings
of
their
pupils
it
must
be
reckoned
a
distinct
disadvantage
for
the
upgrowing
generation
that
all
instruction
ends
at
the
age
of
fourteen
so
that
precisely
at
the
period
of
development
in
which
the
reasoning
powers
are
forming
the
children
are
thrown
back
on
themselves
and
on
any
chance
influences
in
the
interval
between
school
life
and
military
service
the
young
people
not
only
forget
all
that
they
learnt
perhaps
with
aptitude
in
the
national
school
but
they
unthinkingly
adopt
distorted
views
of
life
and
in
many
ways
become
brutalized
from
a
lack
of
counteracting
ideals
a
compulsory
continuation
school
is
therefore
an
absolute
necessity
of
the
age
it
is
also
urgently
required
from
the
military
standpoint
such
a
school
to
be
fruitful
in
results
must
endeavour
not
only
to
prevent
the
scholar
from
forgetting
what
he
once
learnt
and
to
qualify
him
for
a
special
branch
of
work
but
above
all
to
develop
his
patriotism
and
sense
of
citizenship
to
do
this
it
is
necessary
to
explain
to
him
the
relation
of
the
state
to
the
individual
and
to
explain
by
reference
to
our
national
history
how
the
individual
can
only
prosper
by
devotion
to
the
state
the
duties
of
the
individual
to
the
state
should
be
placed
in
the
foreground
this
instruction
must
be
inspired
by
the
spirit
which
animated
schleiermacher
sermons
in
the
blackest
hour
of
prussia
and
culminated
in
the
doctrine
that
all
the
value
of
the
man
lies
in
the
strength
and
purity
of
his
will
in
his
free
devotion
to
the
great
whole
that
property
and
life
are
only
trusts
which
must
be
employed
for
higher
ideals
that
the
mind
which
thinks
only
of
itself
perishes
in
feeble
susceptibility
but
that
true
moral
worth
grows
up
only
in
the
love
for
the
fatherland
and
for
the
state
which
is
a
haven
for
every
faith
and
a
home
of
justice
and
honourable
freedom
of
purpose
only
if
national
education
works
in
this
sense
will
it
train
up
men
to
fill
our
armies
who
have
been
adequately
prepared
for
the
school
of
arms
and
bring
with
them
the
true
soldierly
spirit
from
which
great
deeds
spring
what
can
be
effected
by
the
spirit
of
a
nation
we
have
learnt
from
the
history
of
the
war
of
liberation
that
source
of
patriotic
sentiment
which
should
form
the
backbone
and
centre
of
in
the
national
and
the
continuation
schools
we
can
study
it
also
by
an
example
from
most
recent
history
in
the
war
the
education
of
the
whole
japanese
people
beginning
at
home
and
continued
at
school
was
based
on
a
patriotic
and
warlike
spirit
that
education
combined
with
the
rapidly
acquired
successes
in
culture
and
warfare
aroused
in
the
japanese
a
marvellous
confidence
in
their
own
strength
they
served
with
pride
in
the
ranks
of
the
army
and
dreamed
of
heroic
deeds
all
the
thoughts
of
the
nation
were
turned
towards
the
coming
struggle
while
in
the
course
of
several
years
they
had
spent
their
last
farthing
in
the
creation
of
a
powerful
army
and
a
strong
fleet
b
this
was
the
spirit
that
led
the
japanese
to
victory
the
day
when
the
young
japanese
enlisted
was
observed
as
a
festival
in
his
family
b
in
russia
on
the
contrary
the
idea
was
preached
and
disseminated
that
patriotism
was
an
obsolete
notion
war
was
a
crime
and
an
anachronism
that
warlike
deeds
deserved
no
notice
the
army
was
the
greatest
bar
to
progress
and
military
service
a
dishonourable
trade
b
thus
the
russian
army
marched
to
battle
without
any
enthusiasm
or
even
any
comprehension
of
the
momentous
importance
of
the
great
racial
war
not
of
free
will
but
from
necessity
already
eaten
up
by
the
spirit
of
revolution
and
unpatriotic
selfishness
without
energy
or
initiative
a
mechanical
tool
in
the
hand
of
uninspired
leaders
it
tamely
let
itself
be
beaten
by
a
weaker
opponent
footnote
b
the
work
of
the
russian
general
staff
from
the
russian
by
freiheu
v
tettau
i
have
examined
these
conditions
closely
because
i
attach
great
importance
to
the
national
school
and
the
continuation
school
as
a
means
to
the
military
education
of
our
people
i
am
convinced
that
only
the
army
of
a
warlike
and
patriotic
people
can
achieve
anything
really
great
i
understand
of
course
that
the
school
alone
however
high
its
efficiency
could
not
develop
that
spirit
in
our
people
which
we
in
view
of
our
great
task
in
the
future
must
try
to
awaken
by
every
means
if
we
wish
to
accomplish
something
great
the
direct
influence
of
school
ends
when
the
young
generation
begins
life
and
its
effect
must
at
first
make
itself
felt
very
gradually
later
generations
will
reap
the
fruits
of
its
sowing
its
efficiency
must
be
aided
by
other
influences
which
will
not
only
touch
the
young
men
now
living
but
persist
throughout
their
lives
now
there
are
two
means
available
which
can
work
upon
public
opinion
and
on
the
spiritual
and
moral
education
of
the
nation
one
is
the
press
the
other
is
a
policy
of
action
if
the
government
wishes
to
win
a
proper
influence
over
the
people
not
in
order
to
secure
a
support
of
its
momentary
policy
but
to
further
its
great
political
social
and
moral
duties
it
must
control
a
strong
and
national
press
through
which
it
must
present
its
views
and
aims
vigorously
and
openly
the
government
will
never
be
able
to
count
upon
a
and
people
in
the
hour
of
danger
or
necessity
if
it
calmly
looks
on
while
the
warlike
spirit
is
being
systematically
undermined
by
the
press
and
a
feeble
peace
policy
preached
still
less
if
it
allows
its
own
organs
to
join
in
with
the
same
note
and
continually
to
emphasize
the
maintenance
of
peace
as
the
object
of
all
policy
it
must
rather
do
everything
to
foster
a
military
spirit
and
to
make
the
nation
comprehend
the
duties
and
aims
of
an
imperial
policy
it
must
continually
point
to
the
significance
and
the
necessity
of
war
as
an
indispensable
agent
in
policy
and
civilization
together
with
the
duty
of
and
devotion
to
state
and
country
a
parliamentary
government
which
always
represents
merely
a
temporary
majority
may
leave
the
party
press
to
defend
and
back
its
views
but
a
government
like
the
german
which
traces
its
justification
to
the
fact
that
it
is
superior
to
all
parties
can
not
act
thus
its
point
of
view
does
not
coincide
with
that
of
any
party
it
adopts
a
middle
course
conscious
that
it
is
watching
the
welfare
of
the
whole
community
it
must
therefore
represent
its
attitude
on
general
issues
as
well
as
on
particular
points
independently
and
must
endeavour
to
make
its
aims
as
widely
understood
as
possible
i
regard
it
therefore
as
one
of
the
most
important
duties
of
a
government
like
ours
to
use
the
press
freely
and
wisely
for
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
i
do
not
mean
that
a
few
large
political
journals
should
in
the
interests
of
the
moment
be
well
supplied
with
news
but
that
the
views
of
the
government
should
find
comprehensive
expression
in
the
local
press
it
would
be
an
advantage
in
my
opinion
were
all
newspapers
compelled
to
print
certain
announcements
of
the
government
in
order
that
the
reader
might
not
have
such
a
account
of
public
affairs
as
the
party
press
supplies
it
would
be
a
measure
of
public
moral
and
intellectual
hygiene
as
justifiable
as
compulsory
regulations
in
the
interests
of
public
health
epidemics
of
ideas
and
opinions
are
in
our
old
europe
more
dangerous
and
damaging
than
bodily
illnesses
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
preserve
the
moral
healthiness
of
the
nation
more
important
perhaps
than
teaching
and
enlightenment
by
the
press
is
the
of
nothing
controls
the
spirit
of
the
multitude
so
effectually
as
energetic
deliberate
and
successful
action
conceived
in
a
statesmanlike
sense
such
education
by
a
powerful
policy
is
an
absolute
necessity
for
the
german
people
this
nation
possesses
an
excess
of
vigour
enterprise
idealism
and
spiritual
energy
which
qualifies
it
for
the
highest
place
but
a
malignant
fairy
laid
on
its
cradle
the
most
petty
theoretical
dogmatism
in
addition
to
this
an
unhappy
historical
development
which
shattered
the
national
and
religious
unity
of
the
nation
created
in
the
system
of
small
states
and
in
confessionalism
a
fertile
soil
for
the
natural
tendency
to
particularism
on
which
it
flourished
luxuriantly
as
soon
as
the
nation
was
no
longer
inspired
with
great
and
unifying
thoughts
yet
the
heart
of
this
people
can
always
be
won
for
great
and
noble
aims
even
though
such
aims
can
only
be
attended
by
danger
we
must
not
be
misled
in
this
respect
by
the
press
which
often
represents
a
most
view
and
sometimes
follows
international
or
even
lines
rather
than
national
the
soul
of
our
nation
is
not
reflected
in
that
part
of
the
press
with
its
continual
dwelling
on
the
necessity
of
upholding
peace
and
its
denunciation
of
any
bold
and
comprehensive
political
measure
as
a
policy
of
recklessness
on
the
contrary
an
intense
longing
for
a
foremost
place
among
the
powers
and
for
manly
action
fills
our
nation
every
vigorous
utterance
every
bold
political
step
of
the
government
finds
in
the
soul
of
the
people
a
deeply
felt
echo
and
loosens
the
bonds
which
fetter
all
their
forces
in
a
great
part
of
the
national
press
this
feeling
has
again
and
again
found
noble
expression
but
the
statesman
who
could
satisfy
this
yearning
which
slumbers
in
the
heart
of
our
people
undisturbed
by
the
clamour
of
parties
and
the
party
press
would
carry
all
spirits
with
him
he
is
no
true
statesman
who
does
not
reckon
with
these
factors
of
national
psychology
bismarck
possessed
this
art
and
used
k
with
a
true
he
found
ready
to
hand
one
idea
which
was
common
to
all
the
sincere
wish
for
german
unification
and
the
german
empire
but
the
german
nation
in
its
dissensions
did
not
know
the
ways
which
lead
to
the
realization
of
this
idea
only
under
compulsion
and
after
a
hard
struggle
did
it
enter
on
the
road
of
success
but
the
whole
nation
was
fired
with
high
enthusiasm
when
it
finally
recognized
the
goal
to
which
the
great
statesman
was
so
surely
leading
it
success
was
the
foundation
on
which
bismarck
built
up
the
mighty
fabric
of
the
german
empire
even
in
the
years
of
peace
he
understood
how
to
rivet
the
imagination
of
the
people
by
an
ambitious
and
active
policy
and
how
in
spite
of
all
opposition
to
gain
over
the
masses
to
his
views
and
make
them
serve
his
own
great
aims
he
too
made
mistakes
as
man
and
as
politician
and
the
motto
sum
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
holds
good
of
him
but
in
its
broad
features
his
policy
was
always
imperial
and
of
scope
and
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
principle
that
no
statesman
can
permanently
achieve
great
results
unless
he
commands
the
soul
of
his
people
this
knowledge
he
shared
with
all
the
great
men
of
our
past
with
the
great
elector
frederick
the
incomparable
scharnhorst
and
blücher
for
even
that
hoary
marshal
was
a
political
force
the
embodiment
of
a
political
idea
which
to
be
sure
did
not
come
into
the
foreground
at
the
congress
of
vienna
the
statesman
who
wishes
to
learn
from
history
should
above
all
things
recognize
this
one
fact
that
success
is
necessary
to
gain
influence
over
the
masses
and
that
this
influence
can
only
be
obtained
by
continually
appealing
to
the
national
imagination
and
enlisting
its
interest
in
great
universal
ideas
and
great
national
ambitions
such
a
policy
is
also
the
best
school
in
which
to
educate
a
nation
to
great
military
achievements
when
their
spirits
are
turned
towards
high
aims
they
feel
themselves
compelled
to
contemplate
war
bravely
and
to
prepare
their
minds
to
it
the
man
grows
up
with
manhood
nobler
aims
we
may
learn
something
from
japan
on
this
head
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
loftiest
aims
she
did
not
shrink
from
laying
the
most
onerous
duties
on
the
people
but
she
understood
how
to
fill
the
soul
of
the
whole
people
with
enthusiasm
for
her
great
ideals
and
thus
a
nation
of
warriors
was
educated
which
supplied
the
best
conceivable
material
for
the
army
and
was
ready
for
the
greatest
sacrifices
we
germans
have
a
far
greater
and
more
urgent
duty
towards
civilization
to
perform
than
the
great
asiatic
power
we
like
the
japanese
can
only
fulfil
it
by
the
sword
shall
we
then
decline
to
adopt
a
bold
and
active
policy
the
most
effective
means
with
which
we
can
prepare
our
people
for
its
military
duty
such
a
counsel
is
only
for
those
who
lack
all
feeling
for
the
strength
and
honour
of
the
german
people
chapter
xiv
financial
and
political
preparation
for
war
from
the
discussions
in
the
previous
chapter
it
directly
follows
that
the
political
conduct
of
the
state
while
affecting
the
mental
attitude
of
the
people
exercises
an
indirect
but
indispensable
influence
on
the
preparation
for
war
and
is
to
some
degree
a
preparation
for
war
itself
but
in
addition
to
the
twofold
task
of
exercising
this
intellectual
and
moral
influence
and
of
placing
at
the
disposal
of
the
military
authorities
the
necessary
means
for
keeping
up
the
armaments
still
further
demands
must
be
made
of
those
responsible
for
the
guidance
of
the
state
in
the
first
place
financial
preparations
for
war
must
be
made
quite
distinct
from
the
current
expenditure
on
the
army
the
national
finances
must
be
so
treated
that
the
state
can
bear
the
tremendous
burdens
of
a
modern
war
without
an
economic
crash
further
as
already
mentioned
in
another
place
there
must
be
a
sort
of
mobilization
in
the
sphere
of
commercial
politics
in
order
to
insure
under
all
eventualities
the
supply
of
the
goods
necessary
for
the
material
and
industrial
needs
of
the
country
finally
preparations
for
war
must
also
be
made
politically
that
is
to
say
efforts
must
be
made
to
bring
about
a
favourable
political
conjuncture
and
so
far
as
possible
to
isolate
the
first
enemy
with
whom
a
war
is
bound
to
come
if
that
can
not
be
effected
an
attempt
must
he
made
to
win
allies
in
whom
confidence
can
be
reposed
should
war
break
out
i
am
not
a
sufficient
expert
to
pronounce
a
definite
opinion
on
the
commercial
and
financial
side
of
the
question
in
the
sphere
of
commercial
policy
especially
i
can
not
even
suggest
the
way
in
which
the
desired
end
can
be
obtained
joint
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
and
the
great
import
houses
would
seem
to
be
indicated
as
regards
finance
speaking
again
from
a
purely
unprofessional
standpoint
one
may
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
not
only
essential
to
keep
the
national
household
in
order
but
to
maintain
the
credit
of
the
state
so
that
on
the
outbreak
of
war
it
may
be
possible
to
raise
the
vast
sums
of
money
required
for
carrying
it
on
without
too
onerous
conditions
the
credit
of
state
depends
essentially
on
a
regulated
financial
economy
which
insures
that
the
current
outgoings
are
covered
by
the
current
incomings
other
factors
are
the
national
wealth
the
indebtedness
of
the
state
and
lastly
the
confidence
in
its
productive
and
military
capabilities
as
regards
the
first
point
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
in
a
great
civilized
world
state
the
balancing
of
the
accounts
must
never
be
brought
about
in
the
fashion
by
striking
out
expenditure
for
necessary
requirements
more
especially
expenditure
on
the
military
forces
whose
maintenance
forms
the
foundation
of
a
satisfactory
general
progress
the
incomings
must
on
the
contrary
be
raised
in
proportion
to
the
real
needs
but
especially
in
a
state
which
is
so
wholly
based
on
war
as
the
german
empire
the
old
manly
principle
of
keeping
all
our
forces
on
the
stretch
must
never
be
abandoned
out
of
deference
to
the
effeminate
philosophy
of
the
day
fichte
taught
us
that
there
is
only
one
virtue
to
forget
the
claims
of
one
personality
and
only
one
vice
to
think
of
self
ultimately
the
state
is
the
transmitter
of
all
culture
and
is
therefore
entitled
to
claim
all
the
powers
of
the
individual
for
itself
a
these
ideas
which
led
us
out
of
the
deepest
gloom
to
the
sunlit
heights
of
success
must
remain
our
at
an
epoch
which
in
many
respects
can
be
compared
with
the
opening
years
of
the
last
century
the
contentment
which
then
prevailed
in
prussia
as
if
the
age
of
everlasting
peace
had
come
still
sways
large
sections
of
our
people
and
exerts
an
appreciable
influence
on
the
government
among
that
peaceful
nation
which
behind
the
rampart
of
its
line
of
demarcation
observed
with
philosophic
calm
how
two
mighty
nations
contested
the
sole
possession
of
the
world
nobody
gave
any
thought
to
the
great
change
of
times
in
the
same
way
many
germans
look
contentedly
and
philosophically
at
the
partition
of
the
world
and
shut
their
eyes
to
the
rushing
stream
of
and
the
great
duties
imposed
upon
us
by
it
even
as
then
the
same
pride
the
same
irresolution
spreads
among
us
which
in
our
history
follows
with
uncanny
regularity
the
great
epochs
of
audacity
and
energy

under

is
not

citizens

it

the

producing

our

derive

making

offers

we
have
a
twofold
duty
before
us
first
to
improve
our
armament
secondly
to
promote
the
national
industry
and
to
keep
in
mind
the
liquidation
of
our
debts
so
far
as
our
means
go
the
question
arises
whether
it
is
possible
to
perform
this
twofold
task
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
german
people
has
reached
the
limits
of
possible
taxation
the
taxes
of
prussia
have
indeed
between
and
increased
by
per
cent
per
head
of
the
population
from
marks
to
marks
taxes
and
customs
together
and
the
same
proportion
may
hold
in
the
rest
of
germany
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
huge
increase
in
the
national
wealth
this
amounts
in
the
german
empire
now
to
to
milliard
marks
or
to
marks
per
head
of
the
population
in
france
the
wealth
calculated
on
the
same
basis
is
no
higher
and
yet
in
france
annually
marks
in
germany
only
marks
per
head
of
the
population
are
expended
on
the
army
and
navy
in
england
on
the
contrary
where
the
average
wealth
of
the
individual
is
some
marks
higher
than
in
germany
and
france
the
outlay
for
the
army
and
navy
comes
to
marks
per
head
thus
our
most
probable
opponents
make
appreciably
greater
sacrifices
for
their
armaments
than
we
do
although
they
are
far
from
being
in
equal
danger
politically
attention
must
at
the
same
time
be
called
to
the
fact
that
the
increase
of
wealth
in
germany
continues
to
be
on
an
ascending
scale
trades
and
industries
have
prospered
vastly
and
although
the
year
saw
a
setback
yet
the
upward
tendency
has
beyond
doubt
set
in
again
the
advance
in
trade
and
industry
which
began
with
the
founding
of
the
empire
is
extraordinary
the
total
of
imports
and

similar
figures
can
be
shown
in
many
other
spheres
the
financial
position
of
the
empire
has
considerably
improved
since
the
imperial
finance
reform
of
so
that
the
hope
exists
that
the
budget
may
very
soon
balance
without
a
loan
should
no
new
sacrifices
be
urgent
it
was
obvious
that
with
so
prodigious
a
development
a
continued
growth
of
revenue
must
take
place
and
with
it
a
progressive
capitalization
such
a
fact
has
been
the
case
and
to
a
very
marked
extent
from
the
year
in
prussia
alone
an
increase
of
national
wealth
of
about
milliard
marks
annually
has
taken
place
the
number
of
taxpayers
and
of
property
in
the
property
tax
class
of
to

has
in
prussia
increased
in
these
fourteen

by

by
per

in
the
first
period
therefore
by

in
the
last

by

in

therefore
prosperity
is
increasing
but
this
is
so
in
much
greater
proportion
in
the
large
fortunes
in
the
property
tax
class
of

the
increase
has
been
about
per

an
average
for
the
fourteen

about
per

while
in
the
last
three

it
has
been

in

of

and
upwards
the
increase
for
the
fourteen

amounts
to
per

in
the

and
per

in

and
while
in
the
fourteen
years
the
increase
is
on
an
average
per
cent
annually
it
has
risen
in
the
three
years
to
per

this
means
per

of

in

schedule
of

an

of

in

and
per

we
see
then
especially
in
the
large
estates
a
considerable
and
annually
increasing
growth
which
the
prussian
finance
minister
has
estimated
for
prussia
alone
at
milliards
yearly
in
the
next
three
years
so
that
it
may
be
assumed
to
be
for
the
whole
empire
milliards
yearly
in
the
same
period
wages
have
risen
everywhere
to
give
some
instances
i
will
mention
that
among
the
workmen
at
krupp
factory
at
essen
the
daily
earnings
have
increased
from
by
per
the
pay
per

for

from
by

and
the
annual
earnings
in
the
dortmund
district
of
the
chief
mining
office
from
to
by
per
cent
this
increase
in
earnings
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
the
increase
of
savings
bank
deposits
since
has
reached
the
sum
of
milliard
marks
a
proof
that
in
the
lower
and
poorer
strata
of
the
population
too
a
not
inconsiderable
improvement
in
prosperity
is
perceptible
it
can
also
be
regarded
as
a
sign
of
a
healthy
improving
condition
of
things
that
emigration
and
unemployment
are
considerably
diminished
in
germany
in
only
emigrants
left
our
country
further
according
to
the
statistics
of
the
unions
only
per
cent
of
their
members
were
unemployed
whereas
in
the
same
year
persons
emigrated
from
great
britain
and
per
cent
in
france
it
was
as
much
as
per
cent
of
members
of
workmen
unions
were
unemployed
against
this
brilliant
prosperity
must
be
placed
a
very
large
national
debt
both
in
the
empire
and
in
the
separate
states
the
german
empire
in
the
year
had
marks
debt
and
in
addition
the
national
debt
of
the
separate
states
on
april
reached
in
marks
prussia
bavaria
saxony
würtemberg
baden
hesse
hamburg
lübeck
bremen
against
these
debts
may
be
placed
a
considerable
property
in
domains
forests
mines
and
railways
the
stock
capital
of
the
state
railways
reached
on
march
in
millions
of
marks
in
marks
prussia
hesse
bavaria
saxony
würtemburg
baden
a
grand
total
including
the
smaller
state
systems
of
milliard
marks
this
sum
has
since
risen
considerably
and
reached
at
the
end
of
for
prussia
alone
milliards
nevertheless
the
national
debts
signify
a
very
heavy
burden
which
works
the
more
disadvantageously
because
these
debts
are
almost
all
contracted
in
the
country
and
presses
the
more
heavily
because
the
communes
are
also
often
greatly
in
debt
the
debt
of
the
prussian
towns
and
country
communes
of
inhabitants
and
upwards
alone
amounts
to
million
marks
in
the
whole
empire
to
some
million
marks
this
means
that
interest
yearly
has
to
be
paid
to
the
value
of
million
marks
so
that
many
communes
especially
in
the
east
and
in
the
western
industrial
regions
are
compelled
to
raise
additional
taxation
to
the
extent
of
or
even
per
cent
the
taxes
also
are
not
at
all
equally
distributed
according
to
capacity
to
pay
them
the
main
burden
rests
on
the
middle
class
the
large
fortunes
are
much
less
drawn
upon
some
sources
of
wealth
are
not
touched
by
taxation
as
for
example
the
speculative
income
not
obtained
by
carrying
on
any
business
but
by
speculations
on
the
stock
exchange
which
can
not
be
taxed
until
it
is
converted
into
property
nevertheless
the
german
nation
is
quite
in
a
position
to
pay
for
the
military
preparations
which
it
certainly
requires
for
the
protection
and
the
fulfilment
of
its
duties
in
policy
and
civilization
so
soon
as
appropriate
and
comprehensive
measures
are
taken
and
the
opposing
parties
can
resolve
to
sacrifice
scruples
as
to
principles
on
the
altar
of
patriotism
the
dispute
about
the
imperial
finance
reform
has
shown
how
party
interests
and
selfishness
rule
the
national
representation
it
was
not
pleasant
to
see
how
each
tried
to
shift
the
burden
to
his
neighbour
shoulders
in
order
to
protect
himself
against
financial
sacrifices
it
must
be
supposed
therefore
that
similar
efforts
will
be
made
in
the
future
and
that
fact
must
be
reckoned
with
but
a
considerable
and
rapid
rise
of
the
imperial
revenue
is
required
if
we
wish
to
remain
equal
to
the
situation
and
not
to
abandon
the
future
of
our
country
without
a
blow
under
these
conditions
i
see
no
other
effectual
measure
but
the
speedy
introduction
of
the
imperial
right
of
succession
in
order
to
satisfy
the
urgent
necessity
this
source
of
revenue
would
oppress
no
class
in
particular
but
would
hit
all
alike
and
would
furnish
the
requisite
means
both
to
complete
our
armament
and
to
diminish
our
burden
of
debt
if
the
collateral
relations
with
exception
of
brothers
and
sisters
depended
on
mention
in
the
will
for
any
claim
that
is
to
say
if
they
could
only
inherit
when
a
testimentary
disposition
existed
in
their
favour
and
if
in
absence
of
such
disposition
the
state
stepped
in
as
heir
a
yearly
revenue
of
millions
according
to
a
calculation
based
on
official
material
could
be
counted
upon
this
is
not
the
place
to
examine
this
calculation
more
closely
even
if
it
is
put
at
too
high
a
figure
which
i
doubt
yet
the
yield
of
such
a
tax
would
be
very
large
under
any
circumstances
since
this
like
every
tax
on
an
inheritance
is
a
tax
on
capital
that
is
to
say
it
is
directly
derived
from
invested
capital
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
the
proceeds
should
be
devoted
in
the
first
instance
to
the
improvement
of
the
financial
situation
especially
to
paying
off
debts
otherwise
there
would
be
the
danger
of
acting
like
a
private
gentleman
who
lives
on
his
capital
this
idea
is
also
to
be
recommended
because
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
are
not
constant
but
liable
to
fluctuations
it
would
be
advisable
to
devote
the
proceeds
principally
in
this
way
and
to
allow
a
part
to
go
towards
extinguishing
the
debt
of
the
communes
whose
financial
soundness
is
extremely
important
this
fundamental
standpoint
does
not
exclude
the
possibility
that
in
a
national
crisis
the
tax
may
be
exceptionally
applied
to
other
important
purposes
as
for
example
to
the
completion
of
our
armaments
on
land
and
sea
there
are
two
objections
one
economic
the
other
ethical
which
may
be
urged
against
this
right
of
the
state
or
the
empire
to
inherit
it
is
argued
that
the
proceeds
of
the
tax
were
drawn
from
the
national
wealth
that
the
state
would
grow
richer
the
people
poorer
and
that
in
course
of
time
capital
would
be
united
in
the
hand
of
the
state
that
the
independent
investor
would
be
replaced
by
the
official
and
thus
the
ideal
of
socialism
would
be
realized
secondly
the
requirement
that
relations
in
order
to
inherit
must
be
specially
mentioned
in
the
will
is
thought
to
be
a
menace
to
the
coherence
of
the
family
according
to
our
prevailing
law
the
man
who
wishes
to
deprive
his
family
of
his
fortune
must
do
some
positive
act
he
must
make
a
will
in
which
he
bequeathes
the
property
to
third
persons
charitable
institutions
or
to
any
other
object
it
is
thus
brought
before
his
mind
that
his
natural
heirs
are
his
relations
his
kin
and
that
he
must
make
a
will
if
he
wishes
to
exclude
his
legal
heirs
it
is
impressed
upon
him
that
he
is
interfering
by
testamentary
disposition
in
the
natural
course
of
things
that
he
is
wilfully
altering
it
the
imperial
right
of
succession
is
based
on
the
idea
that
the
community
stands
nearer
to
the
individual
than
his
family
this
is
in
its
inmost
significance
a
socialistic
trait
the
socialistic
state
which
deals
with
a
society
made
up
of
atoms
in
which
every
individual
is
freed
from
the
bonds
of
family
while
all
are
alike
bound
by
a
uniform
socialistic
tie
might
put
forward
a
claim
of
this
sort
f
footnote
f
bolko
katte
in
the
of
november
both
objections
are
unconvincing
so
long
as
the
state
uses
the
proceeds
of
the
inheritances
in
order
to
liquidate
debts
and
other
outgoings
which
would
have
to
be
met
otherwise
the
devolution
of
such
inheritances
on
the
state
is
directly
beneficial
to
all
members
of
the
state
because
they
have
to
pay
less
taxes
legislation
could
easily
prevent
any
accumulation
of
capital
in
the
hands
of
the
state
since
if
such
results
followed
this
right
of
succession
might
be
restricted
or
the
dreaded
socialization
of
the
state
be
prevented
in
other
ways
the
science
of
finance
could
unquestionably
arrange
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
push
the
scheme
to
its
extreme
logical
conclusion
the
ethical
objections
are
still
less
tenable
if
a
true
sense
of
family
ties
exists
the
owner
of
property
will
not
fail
to
make
a
will
which
is
an
extremely
simple
process
under
the
present
law
if
such
ties
are
weak
they
are
assuredly
not
strengthened
by
the
right
of
certain
next
of
kin
to
be
the
heirs
of
a
man
from
whom
they
kept
aloof
in
life
indeed
the
crown
right
of
inheritance
would
produce
probably
the
result
that
more
wills
were
made
and
thus
the
sense
of
family
ties
would
actually
be
strengthened
the
primitive
german
sense
of
law
which
finds
expression
in
the
present
form
of
the
law
of
succession
and
is
summed
up
in
the
notion
that
the
family
is
nearer
to
the
individual
than
the
state
has
so
far
borne
the
most
mischievous
results
it
is
the
root
from
which
the
disruption
of
germany
the
particularism
and
the
defective
patriotism
of
our
nation
have
grown
up
it
is
well
that
in
the
coming
generation
some
check
on
this
movement
should
be
found
and
that
the
significance
of
the
state
for
the
individual
no
less
than
for
the
family
should
be
thoroughly
understood
these
more
or
less
theoretical
objections
are
certainly
not
weighty
enough
to
negative
a
proposal
like
that
of
introducing
this
imperial
right
of
succession
if
the
national
danger
demands
direct
and
rapid
help
and
the
whole
future
of
germany
is
at
stake
if
therefore
no
other
proposals
are
forthcoming
by
which
an
equally
large
revenue
can
be
obtained
the
immediate
reintroduction
of
such
a
law
of
succession
appears
a
necessity
and
will
greatly
benefit
our
country
help
is
urgently
needed
and
there
would
be
good
prospects
of
such
law
being
passed
in
the
reichstag
if
the
government
does
not
disguise
the
true
state
of
the
political
position
political
preparations
are
not
less
essential
than
financial
we
see
that
all
the
nations
of
the
world
are
busily
securing
themselves
against
the
attack
of
more
powerful
opponents
by
alliances
or
and
are
winning
allies
in
order
to
carry
out
their
own
objects
efforts
are
also
often
made
to
stir
up
between
the
other
states
so
as
to
have
a
free

for

is
the
policy
on
which

built

undisturbed
she
can
not
be
justly
blamed
for
this

even

she
has
acted
with
complete
disregard
of
political
morality
she
has
built
up

mighty
empire

object

has
secured

english
people

possibility

careers

must
not
deceive
ourselves
as
to
the
principles
of
this
english
policy
we
must
realize
to
ourselves
that
it
is
guided
exclusively
by
unscrupulous
selfishness
that
it
shrinks
from
no
means
of
accomplishing
its
aims
and
thus
shows
admirable
diplomatic
skill
there
must
be
no
on
the
point
that
political
arrangements
have
only
a
qualified
value
that
they
are
always
concluded
with
a
tacit
reservation
every
treaty
of
alliance
presupposes
the
sic
for
since
it
must
satisfy
the
interests
of
each
contracting
party
it
clearly
can
only
hold
as
long
as
those
interests
are
really
benefited
this
is
a
political
principle
that
can
not
be
disputed
nothing
can
compel
a
state
to
act
counter
to
its
own
interests
on
which
those
of
its
citizens
depend
this
consideration
however
imposes
on
the
honest
state
the
obligation
of
acting
with
the
utmost
caution
when
concluding
a
political
arrangement
and
defining
its
limits
in
time
so
as
to
avoid
being
forced
into
a
breach
of
its
word
conditions
may
arise
which
are
more
powerful
than
the
most
honourable
intentions
the
country
own
interests
considered
of
course
in
the
highest
ethical
sense
must
then
turn
the
scale
frederick
the
great
was
all
his
life
long
charged
with
treachery
because
no
treaty
or
alliance
could
ever
induce
him
to
renounce
the
right
of
free
a
the
great
statesman
therefore
will
conclude
political
or
alliances
on
whose
continuance
he
wishes
to
be
able
to
reckon
only
if
he
is
convinced
that
each
of
the
contracting
parties
will
find
such
an
arrangement
to
his
true
and
unqualified
advantage
such
an
alliance
is
as
i
have
shown
in
another
place
the
the
two
states
from
the
military
no
less
than
from
the
political
aspect
are
in
the
happiest
way
complements
of
each
other
the
german
theatre
of
war
in
the
east
will
be
protected
by
austria
from
any
attempt
to
turn
our
flank
on
the
south
while
we
can
guard
the
northern
frontier
of
austria
and
outflank
any
russian
attack
on
galicia
alliances
in
which
each
contracting
party
has
different
interests
will
never
hold
good
under
all
conditions
and
therefore
can
not
represent
a
permanent
political
system
there
is
no
alliance
or
agreement
in
the
world
that
can
be
regarded
as
effective
if
it
is
not
fastened
by
the
bond
of
the
common
and
reciprocal
interests
if
in
any
treaty
the
advantage
is
all
on
one
side
and
the
other
gets
nothing
this
disproportion
destroys
the
obligation
these
are
the
words
of
frederick
the
great
our
foremost
political
teacher
bismarck
we
must
not
be
blinded
in
politics
by
personal
wishes
and
hopes
but
must
look
things
calmly
in
the
face
and
try
to
forecast
the
probable
attitude
of
the
other
states
by
reference
to
their
own
interests
bismarck
tells
us
that
illusions
are
the
greatest
danger
to
the
diplomatist
he
must
take
for
granted
that
the
other
like
himself
seeks
nothing
but
his
own
advantage
it
will
prove
waste
labour
to
attempt
to
force
a
great
state
by
diplomatic
arrangements
to
actions
or
an
attitude
which
oppose
its
real
interests
when
a
crisis
arises
the
weight
of
these
interests
will
irresistibly
turn
the
scale
when
napoleon
iii
planned
war
against
prussia
he
tried
to
effect
an
alliance
with
austria
and
italy
and
archduke
albert
was
actually
in
paris
to
conclude
the
military
negotiations
b
these
probably
were
going
on
as
the
french
general
lebrun
was
in
vienna
on
the
same
errand
both
countries
left
france
in
the
lurch
so
soon
as
the
first
prussian
flag
flew
victoriously
on
the
heights
of
the
geisberg
a
statesman
less
biassed
than
napoleon
would
have
foreseen
this
since
neither
austria
nor
italy
had
sufficient
interests
at
stake
to
meddle
in
such
a
war
under
unfavourable
conditions
footnote
b
when
colonel
stoffel
the
french
military
attaché
in
berlin
returned
to
paris
and
was
received
by
the
emperor
and
pointed
out
the
danger
of
the
position
and
the
probable
perfection
of
prussia
war
preparations
the
emperor
declared
that
he
was
better
informed
he
proceeded
to
take
from
his
desk
a
memoir
on
the
conditions
of
the
prussian
army
apparently
sent
to
him
by
archduke
albert
which
came
to
quite
different
conclusions
the
emperor
had
made
the
facts
therein
stated
the
basis
of
his
political
and
military
calculations
communications
of
colonel
stoffel
to
the
former
minister
of
war
verdy
who
put
them
at
the
service
of
the
author
france
in
a
similar
spirit
of
selfish
national
interests
unscrupulously
brushed
aside
the
conventions
of
algeciras
which
did
not
satisfy
her
she
will
equally
disregard
all
further
diplomatic
arrangements
intended
to
safeguard
germany
commercial
interests
in
morocco
so
soon
as
she
feels
strong
enough
since
it
is
clearly
her
interest
to
be
undisputed
master
in
morocco
and
to
exploit
that
country
for
herself
france
when
she
no
longer
fears
the
german
arms
will
not
allow
any
official
document
in
the
world
to
guarantee
german
commerce
and
german
enterprise
any
scope
in
morocco
and
from
the
french
standpoint
she
is
right
the
political
behaviour
of
a
state
is
governed
only
by
its
own
interests
and
the
natural
antagonism
and
grouping
of
the
different
great
powers
must
be
judged
by
that
standard
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
it
is
extraordinarily
difficult
to
influence
the
political
grouping
with
purely
selfish
purposes
such
influence
becomes
possible
only
by
the
genuine
endeavour
to
further
the
interests
of
the
state
with
which
closer
relations
are
desirable
and
to
cause
actual
injury
to
its
opponents
a
policy
whose
aim
is
to
avoid
quarrel
with
all
but
to
further
the
interests
of
none
runs
the
danger
of
displeasing
everyone
and
of
being
left
isolated
in
the
hour
of
danger
a
successful
policy
therefore
can
not
be
followed
without
taking
chances
and
facing
risks
it
must
be
conscious
of
its
goal
and
keep
this
goal
steadily
in
view
it
must
press
every
change
of
circumstances
and
all
unforeseen
occurrences
into
the
service
of
its
own
ideas
above
all
things
it
must
he
ready
to
seize
the
psychological
moment
and
take
bold
action
if
the
general
position
of
affairs
indicates
the
possibility
of
realizing
political
ambitions
or
of
waging
a
necessary
war
under
favourable
conditions
the
great
art
of
policy
writes
frederick
the
great
is
not
to
swim
against
the
stream
but
to
turn
all
events
to
one
own
profit
it
consists
rather
in
deriving
advantage
from
favourable
conjunctures
than
in
preparing
such
conjunctures
even
in
his
rheinsberg
days
he
acknowledged
the
principle
to
which
he
adhered
all
his
life
wisdom
is
well
qualified
to
keep
what
one
possesses
but
boldness
alone
can
acquire
i
give
you
a
problem
to
solve
he
said
to
his
councillors
when
the
death
of
emperor
charles
vi
was
announced
when
you
have
the
advantage
are
you
to
use
it
or
not
definite
clearly
thought
out
political
goals
wise
foresight
correct
summing
up
alike
of
one
own
and
of
foreign
interests
accurate
estimation
of
the
forces
of
friends
and
foes
bold
advocacy
of
the
interests
not
only
of
the
but
also
of
allies
and
daring
courage
when
the
critical
hour
strikes
these
are
the
great
laws
of
political
and
military
success
the
political
preparation
for
war
is
included
in
them
he
who
is
blinded
by
the
semblance
of
power
and
can
not
resolve
to
act
will
never
be
able
to
make
political
preparations
for
the
inevitable
war
with
any
success
the
braggart
feebleness
which
travesties
strength
the
immoral
claim
which
swaggers
in
the
sanctity
of
historical
right
the
timidity
which
shelters
its
indecision
behind
empty
and
formal
excuses
never
were
more
despised
than
by
the
great
prussian
king
so
treitschke
tells
us
old
fritz
must
be
our
model
in
this
respect
and
must
teach
us
with
remorseless
realism
so
to
guide
our
policy
that
the
position
of
the
political
world
may
be
favourable
for
us
and
that
we
do
not
miss
the
golden
opportunity
it
is
an
abuse
of
language
if
our
unenterprising
age
tries
to
stigmatize
that
energetic
policy
which
pursued
positive
aims
as
an
adventurist
policy
that
title
can
only
be
given
to
the
policy
which
sets
up
personal
ideals
and
follows
them
without
just
estimation
of
the
real
current
of
events
and
so
literally
embarks
on
incalculable
adventures
as
napoleon
did
in
mexico
and
italy
in
abyssinia
a
policy
taking
all
factors
into
consideration
and
realizing
these
great
duties
of
the
state
which
are
an
historical
legacy
and
are
based
on
the
nature
of
things
is
justified
when
it
boldly
reckons
with
the
possibility
of
a
war
this
is
at
once
apparent
if
one
considers
the
result
to
the
state
when
war
is
forced
on
it
under
disadvantageous
circumstances
i
need
only
instance
and
the
terrible
catastrophe
to
which
the
feeble
unworthy
peace
policy
of
prussia
led
in
this
respect
the
war
speaks
a
clear
language
japan
had
made
the
most
judicious
preparations
possible
political
as
well
as
military
for
the
war
when
she
concluded
the
treaty
with
england
and
assured
herself
of
the
benevolent
neutrality
of
america
and
china
her
policy
no
less
circumspect
than
bold
did
not
shrink
from
beginning
at
the
psychological
moment
the
war
which
was
essential
for
the
attainment
of
her
political
ends
russia
was
not
prepared
in
either
respect
she
had
been
forced
into
a
hostile
position
with
germany
from
her
alliance
with
france
and
therefore
dared
not
denude
her
west
front
in
order
to
place
sufficient
forces
in
the
far
east
internal
conditions
moreover
compelled
her
to
retain
large
masses
of
soldiers
in
the
western
part
of
the
empire
a
large
proportion
of
the
troops
put
into
the
field
against
japan
were
therefore
only
inferior
reserves
none
of
the
preparations
required
by
the
political
position
had
been
made
although
the
conflict
had
long
been
seen
to
be
inevitable
thus
the
war
began
with
disastrous
retreats
and
was
never
conducted
with
any
real
vigour
there
is
no
doubt
that
things
would
have
run
a
different
course
had
russia
made
resolute
preparations
for
the
inevitable
struggle
and
had
opened
the
campaign
by
the
offensive
england
too
was
politically
surprised
by
the
boer
war
and
consequently
had
not
taken
any
military
precautions
at
all
adequate
to
her
aims
or
suited
to
give
weight
to
political
demands
two
points
stand
out
clearly
from
this
consideration
first
of
all
there
is
a
reciprocal
relation
between
the
military
and
political
preparations
for
war
proper
political
preparations
for
war
are
only
made
if
the
statesman
is
supported
by
a
military
force
strong
enough
to
give
weight
to
his
demands
and
if
he
ventures
on
nothing
which
he
can
not
carry
through
by
arms
at
the
same
time
the
army
must
be
developed
on
a
scale
which
takes
account
of
the
political
projects
the
obligation
imposed
on
the
general
to
stand
aloof
from
politics
in
peace
as
well
as
in
war
only
holds
good
in
a
limited
sense
the
war
minister
and
the
head
of
the
general
staff
must
be
kept
with
the
phases
of
policy
indeed
they
must
be
allowed
a
certain
influence
over
policy
in
order
to
adapt
their
measures
to
its
needs
and
are
entitled
to
call
upon
the
statesman
to
act
if
the
military
situation
is
peculiarly
favourable
at
the
same
time
the
minister
who
conducts
foreign
policy
must
on
his
side
never
lose
sight
of
what
is
in
a
military
sense
practicable
he
must
be
constantly
kept
informed
of
the
precise
degree
in
which
army
and
navy
are
ready
for
war
since
he
must
never
aim
at
plans
which
can
not
if
necessary
be
carried
out
by
war
a
veiled
or
open
threat
of
war
is
the
only
means
the
statesman
has
of
carrying
out
his
aims
for
in
the
last
resort
it
is
always
the
realization
of
the
possible
consequences
of
a
war
which
induces
the
opponent
to
give
in
where
this
means
is
renounced
a
policy
of
compromise
results
which
satisfies
neither
party
and
seldom
produces
a
permanent
settlement
while
if
a
statesman
announces
the
possibility
of
recourse
to
the
arbitrament
of
arms
his
threat
must
be
no
empty
one
but
must
be
based
on
real
power
and
firm
determination
if
it
is
not
to
end
in
political
and
moral
defeat
the
second
point
clearly
brought
before
us
is
that
a
timid
and
hesitating
policy
which
leaves
the
initiative
to
the
opponent
and
shrinks
from
ever
carrying
out
its
purpose
with
warlike
methods
always
creates
an
unfavourable
military
position
history
as
well
as
theory
tells
us
by
countless
instances
that
a
energetic
policy
which
holds
its
own
in
the
face
of
all
antagonism
always
reacts
favourably
on
the
military
situation
in
this
respect
war
and
policy
obey
the
same
laws
great
results
can
only
be
expected
where
political
and
military
foresight
and
resolution
join
hands
if
we
regard
from
this
standpoint
the
political
preparation
for
the
next
war
which
germany
will
have
to
fight
we
must
come
to
this
conclusion
the
more
unfavourable
the
political
conjuncture
the
greater
the
necessity
for
a
determined
energetic
policy
if
favourable
conditions
are
to
be
created
for
the
inevitably
threatening
war
so
long
as
we
had
only
to
reckon
on
the
possibility
of
a
war
on
two
fronts
against
france
and
russia
and
could
count
on
help
in
this
war
from
all
the
three
parties
to
the
triple
alliance
the
position
was
comparatively
simple
there
were
then
of
course
a
series
of
various
strategical
possibilities
but
the
problem
could
be
reduced
to
a
small
compass
strategical
attack
on
the
one
side
strategical
defence
on
the
other
or
if
the
austrian
army
was
taken
into
calculation
offensive
action
on
both
sides
the
situation
is
different
we
must
consider
england
as
well
as
france
and
russia
we
must
expect
not
only
an
attack
by
sea
on
our
north
sea
coasts
but
a
landing
of
english
forces
on
the
continent
of
europe
and
a
violation
of
neutrality
by
our
enemies
it
is
also
not
inconceivable
that
england
may
land
troops
in
schleswig
or
jutland
and
try
to
force
denmark
into
war
with
us
it
seems
further
questionable
whether
austria
will
be
in
a
position
to
support
us
with
all
her
forces
whether
she
will
not
rather
be
compelled
to
safeguard
her
own
particular
interests
on
her
south
and
frontiers
an
attack
by
france
through
switzerland
is
also
increasingly
probable
if
a
complete
reorganization
of
the
grouping
of
the
european
states
is
effected
finally
we
should
be
seriously
menaced
in
the
baltic
if
russia
gains
time
to
reconstruct
her
fleet
all
these
unfavourable
conditions
will
certainly
not
occur
simultaneously
but
under
certain
not
impossible
political
combinations
they
are
more
or
less
probable
and
must
be
taken
into
account
from
the
military
aspect
the
military
situation
thus
created
is
very
unfavourable
if
under
such
uncertain
conditions
it
should
be
necessary
to
place
the
army
on
a
war
footing
only
one
course
is
left
we
must
meet
the
situation
by
calling
out
strategic
reserves
which
must
be
all
the
stronger
since
the
political
conditions
are
so
complicated
and
obscure
and
those
opponents
so
strong
on
whose
possible
share
in
the
war
we
must
count
the
strategic
reserve
will
be
to
some
extent
a
political
one
also
a
series
of
protective
measures
necessary
in
any
case
would
have
to
be
at
once
set
on
foot
but
the
mass
of
the
army
would
not
be
directed
to
any
definite
point
until
the
entire
situation
was
clear
and
all
necessary
steps
could
be
considered
until
that
moment
the
troops
of
the
strategic
reserve
would
be
left
in
their
garrisons
or
collected
along
the
railway
lines
and
at
railway
centres
in
such
a
way
that
when
occasion
arose
they
could
be
despatched
in
any
direction
on
the
same
principle
the
on
the
lines
would
have
to
be
kept
in
readiness
the
necessary
for
the
different
transport
arrangements
drawn
up
and
stores
secured
in
safe
depots
on
as
many
different
lines
of
march
as
possible
previous
arrangements
for
unloading
at
the
railway
stations
must
be
made
in
accordance
with
the
most
various
political
prospects
we
should
in
any
case
be
forced
to
adopt
a
waiting
policy
a
strategic
defensive
which
under
present
conditions
is
extremely
unfavourable
we
should
not
be
able
to
prevent
an
invasion
by
one
or
other
of
our
enemies
no
proof
is
necessary
to
show
that
a
war
thus
begun
can
not
hold
out
good
prospects
of
success
the
very
bravest
army
must
succumb
if
led
against
a
crushingly
superior
force
under
most
unfavourable
conditions
a
military
investigation
of
the
situation
shows
that
a
plan
of
campaign
such
as
would
be
required
here
on
the
inner
line
presents
under
the
modern
system
of
mass
armies
tremendous
difficulties
and
has
to
cope
with
strategic
conditions
of
the
most
unfavourable
kind
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
situation
can
only
be
avoided
by
a
policy
which
makes
it
feasible
to
act
on
the
offensive
and
if
possible
to
overthrow
the
one
antagonist
before
the
other
can
actively
interfere
on
this
initiative
our
safety
now
depends
just
as
it
did
in
the
days
of
frederick
the
great
we
must
look
this
truth
boldly
in
the
face
of
course
it
can
be
urged
that
an
attack
is
just
what
would
produce
an
unfavourable
position
for
us
since
it
creates
the
conditions
on
which
the
alliance
would
be
brought
into
activity
if
we
attacked
france
or
russia
the
ally
would
be
compelled
to
bring
help
and
we
should
be
in
a
far
worse
position
than
if
we
had
only
one
enemy
to
fight
let
it
then
be
the
task
of
our
diplomacy
so
to
shuffle
the
cards
that
we
may
be
attacked
by
france
for
then
there
would
be
reasonable
prospect
that
russia
for
a
time
would
remain
neutral
this
view
undoubtedly
deserves
attention
but
we
must
not
hope
to
bring
about
this
attack
by
waiting
passively
neither
france
nor
russia
nor
england
need
to
attack
in
order
to
further
their
interests
so
long
as
we
shrink
from
attack
they
can
force
us
to
submit
to
their
will
by
diplomacy
as
the
upshot
of
the
morocco
negotiations
shows
if
we
wish
to
bring
about
an
attack
by
our
opponents
we
must
initiate
an
active
policy
which
without
attacking
france
will
so
prejudice
her
interests
or
those
of
england
that
both
these
states
would
feel
themselves
compelled
to
attack
us
opportunities
for
such
procedure
are
offered
both
in
africa
and
in
europe
and
anyone
who
has
attentively
studied
prominent
political
utterances
can
easily
satisfy
himself
on
this
point
in
opposition
to
these
ideas
the
view
is
frequently
put
forward
that
we
should
wait
quietly
and
let
time
fight
for
us
since
from
the
force
of
circumstances
many
prizes
will
fall
into
our
laps
which
we
have
now
to
struggle
hard
for
unfortunately
such
politicians
always
forget
to
state
clearly
and
definitely
what
facts
are
really
working
in
their
own
interests
and
what
advantages
will
accrue
to
us
therefrom
such
political
wisdom
is
not
to
be
taken
seriously
for
it
has
no
solid
foundation
we
must
reckon
with
the
definitely
given
conditions
and
realize
that
timidity
and
have
never
led
to
great
results
it
is
impossible
for
anyone
not
close
at
hand
to
decide
what
steps
and
measures
are
imposed
upon
our
foreign
policy
in
order
to
secure
a
favourable
political
situation
should
the
pending
questions
so
momentous
to
germany
existence
come
to
be
settled
by
an
appeal
to
arms
this
requires
a
full
and
accurate
knowledge
of
the
political
and
diplomatic
position
which
i
do
not
possess
one
thing
only
can
be
justly
said
beyond
the
confusion
and
contradictions
of
the
present
situation
we
must
keep
before
us
the
great
issues
which
will
not
lose
their
importance
as
time
goes
on
italy
which
has
used
a
favourable
moment
in
order
to
acquire
settlements
for
her
very
rapidly
increasing
population
persons
emigrated
from
italy
in
can
never
combine
with
france
and
england
to
fulfil
her
political
ambition
of
winning
the
supremacy
in
the
mediterranean
since
both
these
states
themselves
claim
this
place
the
effort
to
break
up
the
triple
alliance
has
momentarily
favoured
the
italian
policy
of
expansion
but
this
incident
does
not
alter
in
the
least
the
fact
that
the
true
interest
of
italy
demands
adherence
to
the
triple
alliance
which
alone
can
procure
her
tunis
and
biserta
the
importance
of
these
considerations
will
continue
to
be
felt
turkey
also
can
not
permanently
go
with
england
france
and
russia
whose
policy
must
always
aim
directly
at
the
annihilation
of
turkey
islam
has
now
as
ever
her
most
powerful
enemies
in
england
and
russia
and
will
sooner
or
later
be
forced
to
join
the
central
european
alliance
although
we
committed
the
undoubted
blunder
of
abandoning
her
in
morocco
there
is
no
true
community
of
interests
between
russia
and
england
in
central
asia
in
persia
as
in
the
mediterranean
their
ambitions
clash
in
spite
of
all
conventions
and
the
state
of
affairs
in
japan
and
china
is
forcing
on
a
crisis
which
is
vital
to
russian
interests
and
to
some
degree
ties
her
hands
all
these
matters
open
out
a
wide
vista
to
german
statesmanship
if
it
is
equal
to
its
task
and
make
the
general
outlook
less
gloomy
than
recent
political
events
seemed
to
indicate
and
then
our
policy
can
count
on
a
factor
of
strength
such
as
no
other
state
possesses
on
an
army
whose
military
efficiency
i
am
convinced
can
not
be
sufficiently
valued
not
that
it
is
perfect
in
all
its
arrangements
and
details
we
have
amply
shown
the
contrary
but
the
spirit
which
animates
the
troops
the
ardour
of
attack
the
heroism
the
loyalty
which
prevail
amongst
them
justify
the
highest
expectations
i
am
certain
that
if
they
are
soon
to
be
summoned
to
arms
their
exploits
will
astonish
the
world
provided
only
that
they
are
led
with
skill
and
determination
the
german
nation
too
of
this
i
am
equally
convinced
will
rise
to
the
height
of
its
great
duty
a
mighty
force
which
only
awaits
the
summons
sleeps
in
its
soul
whoever
can
awaken
the
slumbering
idealism
of
this
people
and
rouse
the
national
enthusiasm
by
placing
before
its
eyes
a
worthy
and
comprehensible
ambition
will
be
able
to
sweep
this
people
on
in
united
strength
to
the
highest
efforts
and
sacrifices
and
will
achieve
a
truly
magnificent
result
in
the
consciousness
of
being
able
at
any
time
to
call
up
these
forces
and
in
the
sure
trust
that
they
will
not
fail
in
the
hour
of
danger
our
government
can
firmly
tread
the
path
which
leads
to
a
splendid
future
but
it
will
not
be
able
to
liberate
all
the
forces
of
germany
unless
it
wins
her
confidence
by
successful
action
and
takes
for
its
motto
the
brave
words
of
goethe

epilogue
after
i
had
practically
finished
the
preceding
pages
the
convention
as
to
morocco
and
the
congo
compensation
were
published
the
war
broke
out
the
revolution
in
china
assumed
dimensions
which
point
to
the
probability
of
new
disorders
in
eastern
asia
and
lastly
it
was
known
that
not
merely
an
cordiale
but
a
real
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
aimed
at
us
exists
between
france
and
england
such
an
alliance
does
not
seem
to
be
concluded
permanently
between
the
two
states
but
clearly
every
possibility
of
war
has
been
foreseen
and
provided
for
i
have
been
able
to
insert
all
the
needful
references
to
the
two
first
occurrences
in
my
text
but
the
light
which
has
lately
been
cast
on
the
conventions
compels
me
to
make
a
few
concluding
remarks
the
german
government
from
important
reasons
which
can
not
be
discussed
have
considered
it
expedient
to
avoid
under
present
conditions
a
collision
with
england
or
france
at
any
cost
it
has
accomplished
this
object
by
the
arrangement
with
france
and
it
may
be
of
course
assumed
that
no
further
concessions
were
attainable
since
from
the
first
it
was
determined
not
to
fight
at
present
only
from
this
aspect
can
the
attitude
of
the
government
towards
france
and
england
be
considered
correct
it
is
quite
evident
from
her
whole
attitude
that
great
britain
was
resolved
to
take
the
chance
of
a
war
her
immediate
preparations
for
war
the
movements
of
her
ships
and
the
attack
of
english
high
finance
on
the
foremost
german
banking
establishments
which
took
place
at
this
crisis
exclude
all
doubt
on
the
point
we
have
probably
obtained
the
concessions
made
by
france
only
because
she
thought
the
favourable
moment
for
the
war
had
not
yet
come
probably
she
will
wait
until
on
the
one
hand
the
triple
alliance
is
still
more
loosened
and
russia
efficiency
by
sea
and
land
is
more
complete
and
until
on
the
other
hand
her
own
african
army
has
been
so
far
strengthened
that
it
can
actively
support
the
rhine
army
this
idea
may
sufficiently
explain
the
morocco
policy
of
the
government
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
if
the
convention
with
france
be
examined
that
it
does
not
satisfy
fully
our
justifiable
wishes
it
will
not
be
disputed
that
the
commercial
and
political
arrangement
as
regards
morocco
creates
favourable
conditions
of
competition
for
our
manufacturers
and
merchants
that
the
acquisition
of
territory
in
the
french
congo
has
a
certain
and
perhaps
not
inconsiderable
value
in
the
future
more
especially
if
we
succeed
in
obtaining
the
spanish
on
the
coast
which
alone
will
make
the
possession
really
valuable
on
the
other
hand
what
we
obtained
can
never
be
regarded
as
a
sufficient
compensation
for
what
we
were
compelled
to
abandon
i
have
emphasized
in
another
place
the
fact
that
the
commercial
concessions
which
france
has
made
are
valuable
only
so
long
as
our
armed
force
guarantees
that
they
are
observed
the
acquisitions
in
the
congo
region
must
as
the
imperial
chancellor
announced
in
his
speech
of
november
be
regarded
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
present
but
of
their
future
value
but
unfortunately
they
seem
from
this
precise
point
of
view
very
inferior
to
morocco
for
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
the
future
morocco
will
be
a
far
more
valuable
possession
for
france
than
the
congo
region
for
germany
especially
if
that
spanish
can
not
be
obtained
the
access
to
the
ubangi
and
the
congo
has
at
present
a
more
or
less
theoretical
value
and
could
be
barred
in
case
of
war
with
us
by
a
few
companies
of
senegalese
it
would
be
mere
if
we
would
see
in
the
colonial
arrangement
which
we
have
effected
with
france
the
paving
of
the
way
for
a
better
understanding
with
this
state
generally
it
certainly
can
not
be
assumed
that
france
will
abandon
the
policy
of
which
she
has
carried
out
for
decades
with
energy
and
unflinching
consistency
at
a
moment
when
she
is
sure
of
being
supported
by
england
merely
because
she
has
from
opportunist
considerations
come
to
terms
with
us
about
a
desolate
corner
of
africa
no
importance
can
be
attached
to
this
idea
in
spite
of
the
views
expounded
by
the
imperial
chancellor
in
his
speech
of
november
we
need
not
therefore
regard
this
convention
as
definitive
it
is
as
liable
to
revision
as
the
algeciras
treaty
and
indeed
offers
in
this
respect
the
advantage
that
it
creates
new
opportunities
of
friction
with
france
the
acquisition
of
territory
in
the
congo
region
means
at
first
an
actual
loss
of
power
to
germany
it
can
only
be
made
useful
by
the
expenditure
of
large
sums
of
money
and
every
penny
which
is
withdrawn
from
our
army
and
navy
signifies
a
weakening
of
our
political
position
but
it
seems
to
me
we
must
when
judging
the
question
as
a
whole
not
merely
calculate
the
concrete
value
of
the
objects
of
the
exchange
but
primarily
its
political
range
and
its
consequences
for
our
policy
in
its
entirety
from
this
standpoint
it
is
patent
that
the
whole
arrangement
means
a
lowering
of
our
prestige
in
the
world
for
we
have
certainly
surrendered
our
somewhat
proudly
announced
pretensions
to
uphold
the
sovereignty
of
morocco
and
have
calmly
submitted
to
the
violent
infraction
of
the
algeciras
convention
by
france
although
we
had
weighty
interests
at
stake
if
in
the
text
of
the
morocco
treaty
such
action
was
called
an
explanation
of
the
treaty
of
and
thus
the
notion
was
spread
that
our
policy
had
followed
a
consistent
line
such
explanation
is
tantamount
to
a
complete
change
of
front
an
additional
political
disadvantage
is
that
our
relations
with
islam
have
changed
for
the
worse
by
the
abandonment
of
morocco
i
can
not
of
course
judge
whether
our
diplomatic
relations
with
turkey
have
suffered
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
we
have
lost
prestige
in
the
whole
mohammedan
world
which
is
a
matter
of
the
first
importance
for
us
it
is
also
a
reasonable
assumption
that
the
morocco
convention
precipitated
the
action
of
italy
in
tripoli
and
thus
shook
profoundly
the
solidity
of
the
triple
alliance
the
increase
of
power
which
france
obtained
through
the
acquisition
of
morocco
made
the
italians
realize
the
importance
of
no
longer
delaying
to
strengthen
their
position
in
the
mediterranean
the
worst
result
of
our
morocco
policy
is
however
undoubtedly
the
deep
rift
which
has
been
formed
in
consequence
between
the
government
and
the
mass
of
the
nationalist
party
the
loss
of
confidence
among
large
sections
of
the
nation
extending
even
to
classes
of
society
which
in
spite
of
their
regular
opposition
to
the
government
had
heartily
supported
it
as
the
representative
of
the
empire
abroad
in
this
weakening
of
public
confidence
which
is
undisguisedly
shown
both
in
the
press
and
in
the
reichstag
although
some
slight
change
for
the
better
has
followed
the
latest
declarations
of
the
government
lies
the
great
disadvantage
of
the
understanding
for
in
the
critical
times
which
we
shall
have
to
face
the
government
of
the
german
empire
must
be
able
to
rely
upon
the
unanimity
of
the
whole
people
if
it
is
to
ride
the
storm
the
unveiling
of
the
agreement
as
to
war
removes
all
further
doubt
on
this
point
the
existence
of
such
relations
between
england
and
france
confirms
the
view
of
the
political
situation
which
i
have
tried
to
bring
out
in
the
various
chapters
of
this
book
they
show
that
we
are
confronted
by
a
firm
phalanx
of
foes
who
at
the
very
least
are
determined
to
hinder
any
further
expansion
of
germany
power
with
this
object
they
have
done
their
best
not
unsuccessfully
to
break
up
the
triple
alliance
and
they
will
not
shrink
from
a
war
the
english
ministers
have
left
no
doubt
on
this
point
a
footnote
a
cf
speech
of
sir
grey
on
november
the
official
statements
of
the
english
statesmen
have
in
spite
of
all
pacific
assurances
shown
clearly
that
the
paths
of
english
policy
lead
in
the
direction
which
i
have
indicated
the
warning
against
aggressive
intentions
issued
to
germany
and
the
assurance
that
england
would
support
her
allies
if
necessary
with
the
sword
clearly
define
the
limits
that
germany
may
not
transgress
if
she
wishes
to
avoid
war
with
england
the
meaning
of
the
english
minister
utterances
is
not
altered
by
his
declaration
that
england
would
raise
no
protest
against
new
acquisitions
by
germany
in
africa
england
knows
too
well
that
every
new
colonial
acquisition
means
primarily
a
financial
loss
to
germany
and
that
we
could
not
long
defend
our
colonies
in
case
of
war
they
form
objects
which
can
be
taken
from
us
if
we
are
worsted
meanwhile
a
clear
commentary
on
the
minister
speech
may
be
found
in
the
fact
that
once
more
the
budget
includes
a
considerable
increase
in
the
naval
estimates
in
this
position
of
affairs
it
would
be
more
than
ever
foolish
to
count
on
any
change
in
english
policy
even
english
attempts
at
a
must
not
blind
us
as
to
the
real
situation
we
may
at
most
use
them
to
delay
the
necessary
and
inevitable
war
until
we
may
fairly
imagine
we
have
some
prospect
of
success
if
the
imperial
government
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
necessary
in
the
present
circumstances
to
avoid
war
still
the
situation
in
the
world
generally
shows
there
can
only
be
a
short
respite
before
we
once
more
face
the
question
whether
we
will
draw
the
sword
for
our
position
in
the
world
or
renounce
such
position
once
and
for
all
we
must
not
in
any
case
wait
until
our
opponents
have
completed
their
arming
and
decide
that
the
hour
of
attack
has
come
we
must
use
the
respite
we
still
enjoy
for
the
most
energetic
warlike
preparation
according
to
the
principles
which
i
have
already
laid
down
all
national
parties
must
rally
round
the
government
which
has
to
represent
our
dearest
interests
abroad
the
willing
devotion
of
the
people
must
aid
it
in
its
bold
determination
and
help
to
pave
the
way
to
military
and
political
success
without
carrying
still
further
the
disastrous
consequences
of
the
morocco
policy
by
unfruitful
and
frequently
unjustified
criticism
and
by
thus
widening
the
gulf
between
government
and
people
we
may
expect
from
the
government
that
it
will
prosecute
the
military
and
political
preparation
for
war
with
the
energy
which
the
situation
demands
in
clear
knowledge
of
the
dangers
threatening
us
but
also
in
correct
appreciation
of
our
national
needs
and
of
the
warlike
strength
of
our
people
and
that
it
will
not
let
any
conventional
scruples
distract
it
from
this
object
repeal
of
the
five
years
act
reconstruction
of
the
army
on
an
enlarged
basis
accelerated
progress
in
our
naval
armaments
preparation
of
sufficient
financial
means
these
are
requirements
which
the
situation
calls
for
new
and
creative
ideas
must
fructify
our
policy
and
lead
it
to
the
happy
goal
the
political
situation
offers
many
points
on
which
to
rest
our
lever
england
too
is
in
a
most
difficult
position
the
conflict
of
her
interests
with
russia
in
persia
and
in
the
newly
arisen
dardanelles
question
as
well
as
the
power
of
islam
in
the
most
important
parts
of
her
colonial
empire
are
the
subjects
of
permanent
anxiety
in
great
britain
attention
has
already
been
called
to
the
significance
and
difficulty
of
her
relations
with
north
america
france
also
has
considerable
obstacles
still
to
surmount
in
her
african
empire
before
it
can
yield
its
full
fruits
the
disturbances
in
the
far
east
will
probably
fetter
russia
forces
and
england
interests
will
suffer
in
sympathy
these
are
all
conditions
which
an
energetic
and
german
policy
can
utilize
in
order
to
influence
the
general
political
situation
in
the
interests
of
our
fatherland
if
people
and
government
stand
together
resolved
to
guard
the
honour
of
germany
and
make
every
sacrifice
of
blood
and
treasure
to
insure
the
future
of
our
country
and
our
state
we
can
face
approaching
events
with
confidence
in
our
rights
and
in
our
strength
then
we
need
not
fear
to
fight
for
our
position
in
the
world
but
we
may
with
ernst
moritz
arndt
raise
our
hands
to
heaven
and
cry
to
god
from
the
height
of
the
starry
sky
may
thy
ringing
sword
flash
bright
let
every
craven
cry
be
silenced
by
thy
might
