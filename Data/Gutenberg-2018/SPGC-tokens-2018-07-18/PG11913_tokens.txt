now
mark
you
my
masters
this
is
comedy
old
play
everybody
who
has
any
connection
with
birmingham
will
be
acquainted
with
the
vast
publishing
establishment
still
known
by
the
short
title
of
meeson
which
is
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
institution
of
the
sort
in
europe
there
are
or
rather
there
were
at
the
date
of
the
beginning
of
this
history
three
partners
in
meeson
meeson
himself
the
managing
partner
addison
and
roscoe
and
people
in
birmingham
used
to
say
that
there
were
others
interested
in
the
affair
for
meeson
was
a
company
limited
however
this
may
be
meeson
and
was
undoubtedly
a
commercial
marvel
it
employed
more
than
two
thousand
hands
and
its
works
lit
throughout
with
the
electric
light
cover
two
acres
and
a
quarter
of
land
one
hundred
commercial
travellers
at
three
pounds
a
week
and
a
commission
went
forth
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
to
sell
the
books
of
meeson
which
were
largely
religious
in
their
nature
in
all
lands
and
tame
authors
who
were
illustrated
by
thirteen
tame
artists
sat
at
salaries
ranging
from
one
to
five
hundred
a
year
in
hutches
in
the
basement
and
week
by
week
poured
out
that
for
which
meeson
was
justly
famous
then
there
were
editors
and
and
heads
of
the
various
departments
and
and
financial
secretaries
and
readers
and
many
managers
but
what
their
names
were
no
man
knew
because
at
meeson
all
the
employees
of
the
great
house
were
known
by
numbers
personalities
and
personal
responsibility
being
the
abomination
of
the
firm
nor
was
it
allowed
to
anyone
having
dealings
with
these
items
ever
to
see
the
same
number
twice
presumably
for
fear
lest
the
number
should
remember
that
he
was
a
man
and
a
brother
and
his
heart
should
melt
towards
the
unfortunate
and
the
financial
interests
of
meeson
should
suffer
in
short
meeson
was
an
establishment
created
for
and
devoted
to
and
the
fact
was
kept
studiously
and
even
insolently
before
the
eyes
of
everybody
connected
with
it
which
was
of
course
as
it
should
be
in
this
happy
land
of
commerce
after
all
that
has
been
written
the
reader
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
partners
in
meeson
were
rich
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
their
palaces
would
have
been
a
wonder
even
in
ancient
babylon
and
would
have
excited
admiration
in
the
corruptest
and
most
luxurious
days
of
rome
where
could
one
see
such
horses
such
carriages
such
galleries
of
sculpture
or
such
collections
of
costly
gems
as
at
the
palatial
halls
of
meeson
addison
and
roscoe
and
to
think
as
the
mighty
meeson
himself
would
say
with
a
lordly
wave
of
his
right
hand
to
some
astonished
wretch
of
an
author
whom
he
has
chosen
to
overwhelm
with
the
sight
of
this
magnificence
to
think
that
all
this
comes
out
of
the
brains
of
chaps
like
you
why
young
man
i
tell
you
that
if
all
the
money
that
has
been
paid
to
you
scribblers
since
the
days
of
elizabeth
were
added
together
it
would
not
come
up
to
my
little
pile
but
mind
you
it
ai
so
much
fiction
that
has
done
the
trick
it
religion
it
piety
as
pays
especially
when
it
printed
then
the
unsophisticated
youth
would
go
away
his
heart
too
full
for
words
but
pondering
how
these
things
were
and
he
would
pass
into
the
meeson
and
learn
something
about
it
one
day
king
meeson
sat
in
his
counting
house
counting
out
his
money
or
at
least
looking
over
the
books
of
the
firm
he
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
his
heavy
brows
were
wrinkled
up
in
a
way
calculated
to
make
the
clerks
shake
on
their
stools
meeson
had
a
branch
establishment
at
sydney
in
australia
which
establishment
had
until
lately
been
paying
it
is
true
not
as
well
as
the
english
one
but
still
fifteen
or
twenty
per
cent
but
now
a
wonder
had
come
to
pass
a
great
american
publishing
firm
had
started
an
opposition
house
in
melbourne
and
their
cuteness
was
more
than
the
cuteness
of
meeson
did
meeson
publish
an
edition
of
the
works
of
any
standard
author
at
threepence
per
volume
the
opposition
company
brought
out
the
same
work
at
did
meeson
subsidise
a
newspaper
to
puff
their
undertakings
the
opposition
firm
subsidised
two
to
cry
them
down
and
so
on
and
now
the
results
of
all
this
were
becoming
apparent
for
the
financial
year
just
ended
the
australian
branch
had
barely
earned
a
beggarly
net
dividend
of
seven
per
cent
no
wonder
meeson
was
furious
and
no
wonder
that
the
clerks
shook
upon
their
stools
this
must
be
seen
into
no
said
meeson
bringing
his
fist
down
with
a
bang
on
to
the
no
was
one
of
the
editors
a
little
man
with
blue
spectacles
he
had
once
been
a
writer
of
promise
but
somehow
had
got
him
for
its
own
and
turned
him
into
a
publisher
hack
quite
so
sir
he
said
humbly
it
is
very
bad
it
is
dreadful
to
think
of
meeson
coming
down
to
seven
per
cent
seven
per
cent
and
he
held
up
his
hands
do
stand
there
like
a
stuck
pig
no
said
meeson
fiercely
but
suggest
something
well
sir
said
no
more
humbly
than
ever
for
he
was
terribly
afraid
of
his
employer
i
think
perhaps
that
somebody
had
better
go
to
australia
and
see
what
can
be
done
i
know
one
thing
that
can
be
done
said
meeson
with
a
snarl
all
those
fools
out
there
can
be
sacked
and
sacked
they
shall
be
and
what
more
i
go
and
sack
them
myself
that
will
do
no
that
will
do
and
no
departed
and
glad
enough
he
was
to
go
as
he
went
a
clerk
arrived
and
gave
a
card
to
the
great
man
miss
augusta
smithers
he
read
then
with
a
grunt
show
miss
augusta
smithers
in
presently
miss
augusta
smithers
arrived
she
was
a
tall
young
lady
of
about
with
pretty
golden
hair
deep
grey
eyes
a
fine
forehead
and
a
delicate
mouth
just
now
however
she
looked
very
nervous
well
miss
smithers
what
is
it
asked
the
publisher
i
came
meeson
i
came
about
my
book
your
book
miss
smithers
this
was
an
affectation
of
forgetfulness
let
me
see
forgive
me
but
we
publish
so
many
books
oh
yes
i
remember
vow
oh
well
i
believe
it
is
going
on
fairly
i
saw
you
advertised
the
sixteenth
thousand
the
other
day
put
in
miss
smithers
apologetically
did
we
did
we
ah
then
you
know
more
about
it
than
i
do
and
he
looked
at
his
visitor
in
a
way
that
conveyed
clearly
enough
that
he
considered
the
interview
was
ended
miss
smithers
rose
and
then
with
a
spasmodic
effort
sat
down
again
the
fact
is
meeson
she
said
the
fact
is
that
i
thought
that
perhaps
as
vow
had
been
such
a
great
success
you
might
perhaps
in
short
you
might
be
inclined
to
give
me
some
small
sum
in
addition
to
what
i
have
received
meeson
looked
up
his
forehead
was
wrinkled
till
the
shaggy
eyebrows
nearly
hid
the
sharp
little
eyes
what
he
said
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
young
gentleman
came
slowly
in
he
was
a
very
young
man
tall
and
well
shaped
with
a
fair
skin
and
jolly
blue
eyes
in
short
a
typical
young
englishman
of
the
better
sort
aetate
suo
i
have
said
that
he
came
slowly
in
but
that
scarcely
conveys
the
gay
and
air
of
independence
which
pervaded
this
young
man
and
which
would
certainly
have
struck
any
observer
as
little
short
of
shocking
when
contrasted
with
the
attitude
of
those
who
crept
round
the
feet
of
meeson
this
young
man
had
not
indeed
even
taken
the
trouble
to
remove
his
hat
which
was
stuck
upon
the
back
of
his
head
his
hands
were
in
his
pockets
a
sacrilegious
whistle
hovered
on
his
lips
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
sanctum
sanctorum
of
the
meeson
establishment
a
how
do
uncle
he
said
to
the
commercial
terror
who
was
sitting
there
behind
his
formidable
books
addressing
him
even
as
though
he
were
an
ordinary
man
why
what
up
just
then
however
he
caught
sight
of
the
very
handsome
young
lady
who
was
seated
in
the
office
and
his
whole
demeanour
underwent
a
most
remarkable
change
out
came
the
hands
from
his
pockets
off
went
the
hat
and
turning
he
bowed
really
rather
nicely
considering
how
impromptu
the
whole
performance
was
what
is
it
eustace
asked
meeson
sharply
oh
nothing
uncle
nothing
it
can
bide
and
without
waiting
for
an
invitation
he
took
a
chair
and
sat
down
in
such
a
position
that
he
could
see
miss
smithers
without
being
seen
of
his
uncle
i
was
saying
miss
smithers
or
rather
i
was
going
to
say
went
on
the
elder
meeson
that
in
short
i
do
not
in
the
least
understand
what
you
can
mean
you
will
remember
that
you
were
paid
a
sum
of
fifty
pounds
for
the
copyright
of
vow
great
heavens
murmured
master
eustace
behind
what
a
do
at
the
time
an
alternative
agreement
offering
you
seven
per
cent
on
the
published
price
of
the
book
was
submitted
to
you
and
had
you
accepted
it
you
would
doubtless
have
realized
a
larger
sum
and
meeson
contracted
his
hairy
eyebrows
and
gazed
at
the
poor
girl
in
a
way
that
was
to
say
the
least
alarming
but
augusta
though
she
felt
sadly
inclined
to
flee
still
stood
to
her
guns
for
to
tell
the
truth
her
need
was
very
great
i
could
not
afford
to
wait
for
the
seven
per
cent
meeson
she
said
humbly
oh
ye
gods
seven
per
cent
when
he
makes
about
murmured
eustace
in
the
background
possibly
miss
smithers
possibly
went
on
the
great
man
you
must
really
forgive
me
if
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
exact
condition
of
your
private
affairs
i
am
however
aware
from
experience
that
the
money
matters
of
most
writing
people
are
a
little
embarrassed
augusta
winced
and
meeson
rising
heavily
from
his
chair
went
to
a
large
safe
which
stood
near
and
extracted
from
it
a
bundle
of
agreements
these
he
glanced
at
one
by
one
till
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
here
is
the
agreement
he
said
let
me
see
ah
i
thought
so
copyright
fifty
pounds
half
proceeds
of
rights
of
translation
and
a
clause
binding
you
to
offer
any
future
work
you
may
produce
during
the
next
five
years
to
our
house
on
the
seven
per
cent
agreement
or
a
sum
not
exceeding
one
hundred
pounds
for
the
copyright
now
miss
smithers
what
have
you
to
say
you
signed
this
paper
of
your
own
free
will
it
so
happens
that
we
have
made
a
large
profit
on
your
book
indeed
i
mind
telling
you
that
we
have
got
as
much
as
we
gave
you
back
from
america
for
the
sale
of
the
american
rights
but
that
is
no
ground
for
your
coming
to
ask
for
more
money
than
you
agreed
to
accept
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
the
whole
course
of
my
professional
experience
never
and
he
paused
and
once
more
eyed
her
sternly
at
any
rate
there
ought
to
be
something
to
come
to
me
from
the
rights
of
translation
i
saw
in
the
paper
that
the
book
was
to
be
translated
into
french
and
german
said
augusta
faintly
oh
yes
no
doubt
eustace
oblige
me
by
touching
the
bell
the
young
gentleman
did
so
and
a
tall
clerk
appeared
no
snarled
meeson
in
the
tone
of
peculiar
amiability
that
he
reserved
for
his
employee
make
out
the
translation
account
of
vow
and
fill
up
a
cheque
of
balance
due
to
the
author
no
vanished
like
a
thin
unhappy
ghost
and
meeson
once
more
addressed
the
girl
before
him
if
you
want
money
miss
smithers
he
said
you
had
better
write
us
another
book
i
am
not
going
to
deny
that
your
work
is
good
work
a
little
too
deep
and
not
quite
orthodox
enough
perhaps
but
still
good
i
tested
it
myself
when
it
came
to
hand
which
is
a
thing
i
do
often
do
and
saw
it
was
good
selling
quality
and
you
see
i
did
make
a
mistake
i
believe
vow
will
sell
twenty
thousand
without
stopping
here
the
account
as
he
spoke
the
clerk
put
down
a
bit
of
paper
and
an
unsigned
cheque
on
the
desk
before
his
employer
and
then
smiled
a
shadowy
smile
and
vanished
meeson
glanced
through
the
account
signed
the
cheque
and
handed
it
together
with
the
account
to
augusta
who
proceeded
to
read
it
it
ran
thus
augusta

herewith
augusta
looked
and
then
slowly
crumpled
up
the
cheque
in
her
hand
if
i
understand
meeson
she
said
you
have
sold
the
two
rights
of
translation
of
my
book
which
you
persuaded
me
to
leave
in
your
hands
for
out
of
which
i
am
to
receive
yes
miss
smithers
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
sign
the
receipt
the
fact
is
that
i
have
a
good
deal
of
business
to
attend
to
no
meeson
suddenly
said
augusta
rising
to
her
feet
and
looking
exceedingly
handsome
and
imposing
in
her
anger
no
i
will
not
sign
the
receipt
and
i
will
not
take
this
cheque
and
what
is
more
i
will
not
write
you
any
more
books
you
have
entrapped
me
you
have
taken
advantage
of
my
ignorance
and
inexperience
and
entrapped
me
so
that
for
five
years
i
shall
be
nothing
but
a
slave
to
you
and
although
i
am
now
one
of
the
most
popular
writers
in
the
country
shall
be
obliged
to
accept
a
sum
for
my
books
upon
which
i
can
not
live
do
you
know
that
yesterday
i
was
offered
a
thousand
pounds
for
the
copyright
of
a
book
like
vow
it
a
large
sum
but
i
have
the
letter
yes
and
i
have
the
book
in
manuscript
now
and
if
i
could
publish
it
i
should
be
lifted
out
of
poverty
together
with
my
poor
little
sister
and
she
gave
a
sob
but
she
went
on
i
can
not
publish
it
and
i
will
not
let
you
have
it
and
be
treated
like
this
i
had
rather
starve
i
will
publish
nothing
for
five
years
and
i
will
write
to
the
papers
and
say
why
because
i
have
been
mr
meeson
cheated
thundered
the
great
man
be
careful
young
lady
mind
what
you
are
saying
i
have
a
witness
eustace
you
hear
eustace
hear
said
eustace
grimly
yes
meeson
i
said
and
i
will
repeat
it
whether
i
am
locked
up
for
it
or
not
good
morning
meeson
and
she
curtseyed
to
him
and
then
suddenly
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
in
a
minute
eustace
was
by
her
side
do
cry
miss
smithers
for
heaven
sake
do
i
ca
bear
to
see
it
he
said
she
looked
up
her
beautiful
grey
eyes
full
of
tears
and
tried
to
smile
thank
you
she
said
i
am
very
silly
but
i
am
so
disappointed
if
you
only
knew
there
i
will
go
thank
you
and
in
another
instant
she
had
drawn
herself
up
and
left
the
room
well
said
meeson
senior
who
had
been
sitting
at
his
desk
with
his
great
mouth
open
apparently
too
much
astonished
to
speak
well
there
is
a
vixen
for
you
but
she
come
round
i
known
them
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
before
there
are
one
or
two
down
there
and
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
where
the
twenty
and
five
tame
authors
sat
each
like
a
rabbit
in
his
little
hutch
and
did
by
the
yard
who
carried
on
like
that
but
they
are
quiet
enough
now
they
show
much
spirit
now
i
know
how
to
deal
with
that
sort
of
thing
and
a
double
tale
of
copy
that
the
ticket
why
that
girl
will
be
worth
fifteen
hundred
a
year
to
the
house
what
do
you
think
of
it
young
man
eh
i
think
answered
his
nephew
on
whose
face
a
curious
look
of
contempt
and
anger
had
gathered
i
think
that
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
chapter
ii
how
eustace
was
disinherited
there
was
a
pause
a
dreadful
pause
the
flash
had
left
the
cloud
but
the
answering
thunder
had
not
burst
upon
the
ear
meeson
gasped
then
he
took
up
the
cheque
which
augusta
had
thrown
upon
the
table
and
slowly
crumpled
it
what
did
you
say
young
man
he
said
at
last
in
a
cold
hard
voice
i
said
that
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
answered
his
nephew
standing
his
ground
bravely
and
what
is
more
i
meant
it
oh
now
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
explain
exactly
why
you
said
that
and
why
you
meant
it
i
meant
it
answered
his
nephew
speaking
in
a
full
strong
voice
because
that
girl
was
right
when
she
said
that
you
had
cheated
her
and
you
know
that
she
was
right
i
have
seen
the
accounts
of
vow
i
saw
them
this
morning
and
you
have
already
made
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
clear
profit
on
the
book
and
then
when
she
comes
to
ask
you
for
something
over
the
beggarly
fifty
pounds
which
you
doled
out
to
her
you
refuse
and
offer
her
three
pounds
as
her
share
of
the
translation
rights
three
pounds
as
against
your
eleven
go
on
interrupted
his
uncle
pray
go
on
all
right
i
am
going
that
is
not
all
you
actually
avail
yourself
of
a
disgraceful
trick
to
entrap
this
unfortunate
girl
into
an
agreement
whereby
she
becomes
a
literary
bondslave
for
five
years
as
soon
as
you
see
that
she
has
genius
you
tell
her
that
the
expense
of
bringing
out
her
book
and
of
advertising
up
her
name
will
be
very
great
so
great
indeed
that
you
can
not
undertake
it
unless
indeed
she
agrees
to
let
you
have
the
first
offer
of
everything
she
writes
for
five
years
to
come
at
somewhere
about
a
fourth
of
the
usual
rate
of
a
successful
author
pay
though
of
course
you
do
tell
her
that
you
take
advantage
of
her
inexperience
to
bind
her
by
this
iniquitous
contract
knowing
that
the
end
of
it
will
be
that
you
will
advance
her
a
little
money
and
get
her
into
your
power
and
then
will
send
her
down
there
to
the
hutches
where
all
the
spirit
and
originality
and
genius
will
be
crushed
out
of
her
work
and
she
will
become
a
like
the
rest
of
them
for
meeson
is
a
strictly
commercial
undertaking
you
know
and
meeson
public
do
like
genius
they
like
their
literature
dull
and
holy
and
it
an
infernal
shame
that
what
it
is
uncle
and
the
young
man
whose
blue
eyes
were
by
this
time
flashing
fire
for
he
had
worked
himself
up
as
he
went
along
brought
his
fist
down
with
a
bang
upon
the
writing
table
by
way
of
emphasising
his
words
have
you
done
said
his
uncle
yes
i
done
and
i
hope
that
i
have
put
it
plain
very
well
and
now
might
i
ask
you
supposing
that
you
should
ever
come
to
manage
this
business
if
your
sentiments
accurately
represent
the
system
upon
which
you
would
proceed
of
course
they
do
i
am
not
going
to
turn
cheat
for
anybody
thank
you
they
seem
to
have
taught
you
the
art
of
plain
speaking
up
at
oxford
though
it
appears
with
a
sneer
they
taught
you
very
little
else
well
then
now
it
is
my
turn
to
speak
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
young
man
you
will
either
instantly
beg
my
pardon
for
what
you
have
said
or
you
will
leave
meeson
for
good
and
all
i
wo
beg
your
pardon
for
speaking
the
truth
said
eustace
hotly
the
fact
is
that
here
you
never
hear
the
truth
all
these
poor
devils
creep
and
crawl
about
you
and
dare
call
their
souls
their
own
i
shall
be
devilish
glad
to
get
out
of
this
place
i
can
tell
you
all
this
chickery
and
pokery
makes
me
sick
the
place
stinks
and
reeks
of
sharp
practice
and
by
fair
means
or
foul
the
elder
man
had
up
till
now
at
all
events
to
outward
appearance
kept
his
temper
but
this
last
flower
of
vigorous
english
was
altogether
too
much
for
one
whom
the
possession
of
so
much
money
had
for
many
years
shielded
from
hearing
unpleasant
truths
put
roughly
the
man
face
grew
like
a
devil
his
thick
eyebrows
contracted
themselves
and
his
pale
lips
quivered
with
fury
for
a
few
seconds
he
could
not
speak
so
great
was
his
emotion
when
at
length
he
did
his
voice
was
as
thick
and
laden
with
rage
as
a
dense
mist
is
with
rain
you
impudent
young
rascal
he
began
you
ungrateful
foundling
do
you
suppose
that
when
my
brother
left
you
to
starve
which
was
all
that
you
were
fit
for
i
picked
you
out
of
the
gutter
for
this
that
you
should
have
the
insolence
to
come
and
tell
me
how
to
conduct
my
business
now
young
man
i
just
tell
you
what
it
is
you
can
be
off
and
conduct
a
business
of
your
own
on
whatever
principles
you
choose
get
out
of
meeson
sir
and
never
dare
to
show
your
nose
here
again
or
i
give
the
porters
orders
to
hustle
you
off
the
premises
and
now
that
all
i
done
with
you
never
you
look
to
me
for
another
sixpence
not
going
to
support
you
any
longer
i
can
tell
you
and
what
more
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
just
now
i
going
off
to
old
todd
that
my
lawyer
and
i
going
to
tell
him
to
make
another
will
and
to
leave
every
farthing
i
have
and
that
is
much
short
of
two
millions
one
way
and
another
to
addison
and
roscoe
they
do
want
it
but
that
do
matter
you
sha
have
it
no
not
a
farthing
of
it
and
i
wo
have
a
pile
like
that
frittered
away
in
charities
and
mismanagement
there
now
my
fine
young
gentleman
just
be
off
and
see
if
your
new
business
principles
will
get
you
a
living
all
right
uncle
i
going
said
the
young
man
quietly
i
quite
understand
what
our
quarrel
means
for
me
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
am
not
sorry
i
have
never
wished
to
be
dependent
on
you
or
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
business
carried
on
as
meeson
is
i
have
a
hundred
a
year
my
mother
left
me
and
with
the
help
of
that
and
my
education
i
hope
to
make
a
living
still
i
do
want
to
part
from
you
in
anger
because
you
have
been
very
kind
to
me
at
times
and
as
you
remind
me
you
picked
me
out
of
the
gutter
when
i
was
orphaned
or
not
far
from
it
so
i
hope
you
will
shake
hands
before
i
go
ah
snarled
his
uncle
you
want
to
pipe
down
now
do
you
but
that
wo
do
off
you
go
and
mind
you
do
set
foot
in
pompadour
hall
meeson
seat
unless
it
is
to
get
your
clothes
come
cut
you
misunderstand
me
said
eustace
with
a
touch
of
native
dignity
which
became
him
very
well
probably
we
shall
not
meet
again
and
i
did
not
wish
to
part
in
anger
that
was
all
good
morning
and
he
bowed
and
left
the
office
confound
him
muttered
his
uncle
as
the
door
closed
he
a
good
plucked
one
showed
spirit
but
i
show
spirit
too
meeson
is
a
man
of
his
word
cut
him
off
with
a
shilling
not
i
cut
him
off
with
nothing
at
all
and
yet
curse
it
i
like
the
lad
well
i
done
with
him
thanks
to
that
minx
of
a
smithers
girl
perhaps
he
sweet
on
her
then
they
can
go
and
starve
together
and
be
hanged
to
them
she
had
better
keep
out
of
my
way
for
she
shall
smart
for
this
so
sure
as
my
name
is
jonathan
meeson
i
keep
her
up
to
the
letter
of
that
agreement
and
if
she
tries
to
publish
a
book
inside
of
this
country
or
out
of
it
i
crush
her
yes
i
crush
her
if
it
cost
me
five
thousand
to
do
it
and
with
a
snarl
he
dropped
his
fist
heavily
upon
the
table
before
him
then
he
rose
put
poor
augusta
agreement
carefully
back
into
the
safe
which
he
shut
with
a
savage
snap
and
proceeded
to
visit
the
various
departments
of
his
vast
establishment
and
to
make
such
hay
therein
as
had
never
before
been
dreamt
of
in
the
classic
halls
of
meeson
to
this
hour
the
clerks
of
the
great
house
talk
of
that
dreadful
day
with
bated
breath
for
as
bloody
hector
raged
through
the
greeks
so
did
the
great
meeson
rage
through
his
hundred
departments
in
the
very
first
office
he
caught
a
wretched
clerk
eating
sardine
sandwiches
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
took
the
sandwiches
and
threw
them
through
the
window
do
you
suppose
i
pay
you
to
come
and
eat
your
filthy
sandwiches
here
he
asked
savagely
there
now
you
can
go
and
look
for
them
and
see
you
here
you
need
trouble
to
come
back
you
idle
worthless
fellow
off
you
go
and
remember
you
need
not
send
to
me
for
a
character
now
then
double
quick
the
unfortunate
departed
feebly
remonstrating
and
meeson
having
glared
around
at
the
other
clerks
and
warned
them
that
unless
they
were
careful
very
careful
they
would
soon
follow
in
his
tracks
continued
his
course
of
devastation
presently
he
met
an
editor
no
it
was
who
was
bringing
him
an
agreement
to
sign
he
snatched
it
from
him
and
glanced
through
it
what
do
you
mean
by
bringing
me
a
thing
like
this
he
said
all
wrong
it
is
exactly
as
you
dictated
to
me
yesterday
sir
said
the
editor
indignantly
what
do
you
mean
to
contradict
me
roared
meeson
look
here
no
you
and
i
had
better
part
now
no
words
your
salary
will
be
paid
to
you
till
the
end
of
the
month
and
if
you
would
like
to
bring
an
action
for
wrongful
dismissal
why
i
your
man
good
morning
no
good
morning
next
he
crossed
a
courtyard
where
by
slipping
stealthily
around
the
corner
he
came
upon
a
jolly
little
errand
boy
who
was
enjoying
a
solitary
game
of
marbles
came
his
cane
across
the
seat
of
that
errand
boy
trousers
and
in
another
minute
he
had
followed
the
editor
and
the
clerk
and
so
the
merry
game
went
on
for
half
an
hour
or
more
till
at
last
meeson
was
fain
to
cease
his
troubling
being
too
exhausted
to
continue
his
destroying
course
but
next
morning
there
was
promotion
going
on
in
the
great
publishing
house
eleven
vacancies
had
to
be
filled
a
couple
of
glasses
of
brown
sherry
and
a
few
sandwiches
which
he
hastily
swallowed
at
a
neighboring
restaurant
quickly
restored
him
however
and
jumping
into
a
cab
he
drove
post
haste
to
his
lawyers
todd
and
james
is
todd
in
he
said
to
the
managing
clerk
who
came
forward
bowing
obsequiously
to
the
richest
man
in
birmingham
todd
will
be
disengaged
in
a
few
minutes
sir
he
said
may
i
offer
you
the
damn
the
was
the
polite
answer
i
do
come
here
to
read
newspapers
tell
todd
i
must
see
him
at
once
or
else
i
shall
go
elsewhere
i
am
much
afraid
sir
began
the
managing
clerk
meeson
jumped
up
and
grabbed
his
hat
now
then
which
is
it
to
be
he
said
oh
certainly
sir
pray
be
seated
answered
the
manager
in
great
alarm
meeson
business
was
not
a
thing
to
be
lightly
lost
i
will
see
todd
instantly
and
he
vanished
almost
simultaneously
with
his
departure
an
old
lady
was
unceremoniously
bundled
out
of
an
inner
room
clutching
feebly
at
a
reticule
full
of
papers
and
proclaiming
loudly
that
her
head
was
going
round
and
round
the
poor
old
soul
was
just
altering
her
will
for
the
eighteenth
time
in
favor
of
a
brand
new
charity
highly
recommended
by
royalty
and
to
be
suddenly
shot
from
the
revered
presence
of
her
lawyer
out
into
the
outer
darkness
of
the
clerk
office
was
really
too
much
for
her
in
another
minute
meeson
was
being
warmly
even
enthusiastically
greeted
by
todd
himself
todd
was
a
jumpy
little
man
who
spoke
in
jerks
and
gushes
in
such
a
way
as
to
remind
one
of
a
through
which
water
was
being
pumped
intermittently
how
do
you
do
my
dear
sir
delighted
to
have
this
pleasure
he
began
with
a
sudden
gush
and
then
suddenly
dried
up
as
he
noticed
the
ominous
expression
on
the
great
man
brow
i
am
sure
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
were
kept
waiting
my
dear
sir
but
i
was
at
the
moment
engaged
with
an
excellent
and
most
christian
testator
here
he
suddenly
jumped
and
dried
up
again
for
meeson
without
the
slightest
warning
ejaculated
curse
your
christian
testator
and
look
here
todd
just
you
see
that
it
does
not
happen
again
i
a
christian
testator
too
and
christians
of
my
cut
are
accustomed
to
be
kept
standing
about
just
like
or
authors
see
that
it
do
happen
again
todd
i
am
sure
i
am
exceedingly
grieved
circumstances
oh
never
mind
all
that
i
want
my
will
will
will
forgive
me
a
little
confused
that
all
your
manner
is
so
full
of
hearty
old
kind
of
vigour
here
he
stopped
more
suddenly
even
than
usual
for
meeson
fixed
him
with
his
savage
eye
and
then
jerked
himself
out
of
the
room
to
look
for
the
document
in
question
little
idiot
muttered
meeson
i
give
him
the
sack
too
if
he
is
more
careful
by
jove
why
should
i
not
have
my
own
resident
solicitor
i
could
get
a
sharp
hand
with
a
damaged
character
for
about
a
year
and
i
pay
that
old
todd
quite
there
is
a
vacant
place
in
the
hutches
that
i
could
turn
into
an
office
hang
me
if
i
do
do
it
i
will
make
that
little
chirping
grasshopper
jump
to
some
purpose
i
warrant
and
he
chuckled
at
the
idea
just
then
todd
returned
with
the
will
and
before
he
could
begin
to
make
any
explanations
his
employer
cut
him
short
with
a
sharp
order
to
read
the
gist
of
it
this
the
lawyer
proceeded
to
do
it
was
very
short
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
legacies
amounting
in
all
to
about
twenty
thousand
pounds
bequeathed
all
the
testator
vast
fortune
and
estates
including
his
by
far
the
largest
interest
in
the
great
publishing
house
and
his
palace
with
the
paintings
and
other
valuable
contents
known
as
pompadour
hall
to
his
nephew
eustace
meeson
very
well
he
said
when
the
reading
was
finished
now
give
it
to
me
todd
obeyed
and
handed
the
document
to
his
patron
who
deliberately
rent
it
into
fragments
with
his
strong
fingers
and
then
completed
its
destruction
by
tearing
it
with
his
big
white
teeth
this
done
he
mixed
the
little
pieces
up
threw
them
on
the
floor
and
stamped
upon
them
with
an
air
of
malignity
that
almost
frightened
jerky
little
todd
now
then
he
grimly
said
there
an
end
of
the
old
love
so
let
on
with
the
new
take
your
pen
and
receive
my
instructions
for
my
will
todd
did
as
he
was
bid
i
leave
all
my
property
real
and
personal
to
be
divided
in
equal
shares
between
my
two
partners
alfred
tom
addison
and
cecil
spooner
roscoe
there
that
short
and
sweet
and
one
way
and
another
means
a
couple
of
millions
good
heavens
sir
jerked
out
todd
why
do
you
mean
to
quite
cut
out
your
nephew
and
the
other
legatees
he
added
by
way
of
an
afterthought
of
course
i
do
that
is
as
regards
my
nephew
the
legatees
may
stand
as
before
well
all
i
have
to
say
went
on
the
little
man
astonished
into
honesty
is
that
it
is
the
most
shameful
thing
i
ever
heard
of
indeed
todd
is
it
well
now
may
i
ask
you
am
i
leaving
this
property
or
are
you
do
trouble
yourself
to
answer
that
however
but
just
attend
either
you
draw
up
that
will
at
once
while
i
wait
or
you
say
to
about
a
year
for
that
what
meeson
business
is
worth
i
reckon
now
you
take
your
choice
todd
did
take
his
choice
in
under
an
hour
the
will
which
was
very
short
was
drawn
and
engrossed
now
then
said
meeson
addressing
himself
to
todd
and
the
managing
clerk
as
he
took
the
quill
between
his
fingers
to
sign
do
you
two
bear
in
mind
that
at
the
moment
i
execute
this
will
i
am
of
sound
mind
memory
and
understanding
there
you
are
now
do
you
two
witness
it
was
night
and
king
capital
in
the
shape
of
meeson
sat
alone
at
dinner
in
his
palatial
at
pompadour
dinner
was
over
the
powdered
footman
had
departed
with
stately
tread
and
the
head
butler
was
just
placing
the
decanters
of
richly
coloured
wine
before
the
solitary
lord
of
all
the
dinner
had
been
a
melancholy
failure
dish
after
dish
the
cost
of
any
one
of
which
would
have
fed
a
poor
child
for
a
month
had
been
brought
up
and
handed
to
the
master
only
to
be
found
fault
with
and
sent
away
on
that
night
meeson
had
no
appetite
johnson
he
said
to
the
butler
when
he
was
sure
the
footman
could
not
hear
him
has
eustace
been
here
yes
sir
has
he
gone
yes
sir
he
came
to
fetch
his
things
and
then
went
away
in
a
cab
where
to
i
do
know
sir
he
told
the
man
to
drive
to
birmingham
did
he
leave
any
message
yes
sir
he
bade
me
say
that
you
should
not
be
troubled
with
him
again
but
that
he
was
sorry
that
you
had
parted
from
him
in
anger
why
did
you
not
give
me
that
message
before
because
eustace
said
i
was
not
to
give
it
unless
you
asked
after
him
very
good
johnson
yes
sir
you
will
give
orders
that
eustace
name
is
not
to
be
mentioned
in
this
house
again
any
servant
mentioning
eustace
name
will
be
dismissed
very
good
sir
and
johnson
went
meeson
gazed
round
him
he
looked
at
the
long
array
of
glass
and
silver
at
the
spotless
napery
and
costly
flowers
he
looked
at
the
walls
hung
with
works
of
art
which
whatever
else
they
might
be
were
at
least
expensive
at
the
mirrors
and
the
soft
at
the
marble
mantelpieces
and
the
bright
warm
fires
for
it
was
november
at
the
rich
wall
paper
and
the
soft
carpet
and
reflected
that
they
were
all
his
and
then
he
sighed
and
his
coarse
heavy
face
sank
in
and
grew
sad
of
what
use
was
this
last
extremity
of
luxury
to
him
he
had
nobody
to
leave
it
to
and
to
speak
the
truth
it
gave
him
but
little
pleasure
such
pleasure
as
he
had
in
life
was
derived
from
making
money
not
from
spending
it
the
only
times
when
he
was
really
happy
were
when
he
was
in
his
counting
house
directing
the
enterprises
of
his
vast
establishment
and
adding
sovereign
by
sovereign
to
his
enormous
accumulations
that
had
been
his
one
joy
for
forty
years
and
it
was
still
his
joy
and
then
he
fell
to
thinking
of
his
nephew
the
only
son
of
his
brother
whom
he
had
once
loved
before
he
lost
himself
in
publishing
books
and
making
money
and
sighed
he
had
been
attached
to
the
lad
in
his
own
coarse
way
and
it
was
a
blow
to
him
to
cut
himself
loose
from
him
but
eustace
had
defied
him
and
what
was
worse
he
had
told
him
the
truth
which
he
of
all
men
could
not
bear
he
had
said
that
his
system
of
trade
was
dishonest
that
he
took
more
than
his
due
and
it
was
so
he
knew
it
but
he
could
not
tolerate
that
it
should
be
told
him
and
that
his
whole
life
should
thereby
be
discredited
and
even
his
accumulated
gold
tarnished
stamped
as
least
of
all
could
he
bear
it
from
his
dependent
he
was
not
altogether
a
bad
man
nobody
is
he
was
only
a
coarse
vulgar
tradesman
hardened
and
defiled
by
a
long
career
of
sharp
dealing
at
the
bottom
he
had
his
feelings
like
other
men
but
he
could
not
tolerate
exposure
or
even
contradiction
therefore
he
had
revenged
himself
and
yet
as
he
sat
there
in
solitary
glory
he
realized
that
to
revenge
does
not
bring
happiness
and
could
even
find
it
in
his
heart
to
envy
the
steadfast
honesty
that
had
defied
him
at
the
cost
of
his
own
ruin
not
that
he
meant
to
relent
or
alter
his
determination
meeson
never
relented
and
never
changed
his
mind
had
he
done
so
he
would
not
at
that
moment
have
been
the
master
of
two
millions
of
money
chapter
iii
augusta
little
sister
when
augusta
left
meeson
she
was
in
a
very
sad
condition
of
mind
to
explain
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
a
word
or
two
about
that
young
lady
previous
history
her
father
had
been
a
clergyman
and
like
most
clergymen
not
overburdened
with
the
good
things
of
this
world
when
smithers
or
rather
the
rev
james
smithers
had
died
he
left
behind
him
a
widow
and
two
children
augusta
aged
fourteen
and
jeannie
aged
two
there
had
been
two
others
both
boys
who
had
come
into
the
world
between
augusta
and
jeannie
but
they
had
both
preceded
their
father
to
the
land
of
shadows
smithers
had
fortunately
for
herself
a
life
interest
in
a
sum
of
which
being
well
invested
brought
her
in
a
year
and
in
order
to
turn
this
little
income
to
the
best
possible
account
and
give
her
two
girls
the
best
educational
opportunities
possible
under
the
circumstances
she
on
her
death
moved
from
the
village
where
he
had
for
many
years
been
curate
into
the
city
of
birmingham
here
she
lived
in
absolute
retirement
for
some
seven
years
and
then
suddenly
died
leaving
the
two
girls
then
respectively
nineteen
and
eight
years
of
age
to
mourn
her
loss
and
friendless
as
they
were
to
fight
their
way
in
the
hard
world
smithers
had
been
a
saving
woman
and
on
her
death
it
was
found
that
after
paying
all
debts
there
remained
a
sum
of
for
the
two
girls
to
live
on
and
nothing
else
for
their
mother
fortune
died
with
her
now
it
will
be
obvious
that
the
interest
arising
from
six
hundred
pounds
is
not
sufficient
to
support
two
young
people
and
therefore
augusta
was
forced
to
live
upon
the
principal
from
an
early
age
however
she
augusta
had
shown
a
strong
literary
tendency
and
shortly
after
her
mother
death
she
published
her
first
book
at
her
own
expense
it
was
a
dead
failure
and
cost
her
pounds
the
balance
between
the
profit
and
loss
account
after
awhile
however
she
recovered
from
this
blow
and
wrote
jemima
vow
which
was
taken
up
by
meeson
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
proved
the
success
of
the
year
of
the
nature
of
the
agreement
into
which
she
entered
with
meeson
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
and
he
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
to
learn
that
under
its
cruel
provisions
augusta
notwithstanding
her
name
and
fame
was
absolutely
prohibited
from
reaping
the
fruits
of
her
success
she
could
only
publish
with
meesons
and
at
the
fixed
pay
of
seven
per
cent
on
the
advertised
price
of
her
work
now
something
over
three
years
had
elapsed
since
the
death
of
smithers
and
it
will
therefore
be
obvious
that
there
was
not
much
remaining
of
the
six
hundred
pounds
which
she
had
left
behind
her
the
two
girls
had
indeed
lived
economically
enough
in
a
couple
of
small
rooms
in
a
back
street
but
their
expenses
had
been
enormously
increased
by
the
serious
illness
from
a
pulmonary
complaint
of
the
little
girl
jeannie
now
a
child
between
twelve
and
thirteen
years
of
age
on
that
morning
augusta
had
seen
the
doctor
and
been
crushed
into
the
dust
by
the
expression
of
his
conviction
that
unless
her
little
sister
was
moved
to
a
warmer
climate
for
a
period
of
at
least
a
year
she
would
not
live
through
the
winter
and
die
at
any
moment
take
jeannie
to
a
warmer
climate
he
might
as
well
have
told
augusta
to
take
her
to
the
moon
alas
she
had
not
the
money
and
did
not
know
where
to
turn
to
get
it
oh
reader
pray
to
heaven
that
it
may
never
be
your
lot
to
see
your
best
beloved
die
for
the
want
of
a
few
hundred
pounds
wherewith
to
save
her
life
it
was
in
this
terrible
emergency
that
she
had
driven
thereto
by
her
agony
of
mind
tried
to
get
something
beyond
her
strict
and
legal
due
out
of
meeson
meeson
that
had
made
hundreds
and
hundreds
out
of
her
book
and
paid
her
fifty
pounds
we
know
how
she
fared
in
that
attempt
on
leaving
their
office
augusta
bethought
her
of
her
banker
perhaps
he
might
be
willing
to
advance
something
it
was
a
horrible
task
but
she
determined
to
undertake
it
so
she
walked
to
the
bank
and
asked
to
see
the
manager
he
was
out
but
would
be
in
at
three
she
went
to
a
shop
near
and
got
a
bun
and
glass
of
milk
and
waited
till
she
was
ashamed
to
wait
any
longer
and
then
she
walked
about
the
streets
till
three
at
the
stroke
of
the
hour
she
returned
and
was
shown
into
the
manager
private
room
where
a
dry
unsympathetic
looking
little
man
was
sitting
before
a
big
book
it
was
not
the
same
man
whom
augusta
had
met
before
and
her
heart
sank
proportionately
what
followed
need
not
be
repeated
here
the
manager
listened
to
her
faltering
tale
with
a
few
stereotyped
expressions
of
sympathy
and
when
she
had
done
regretted
that
speculative
loans
were
contrary
to
the
custom
of
the
bank
and
politely
bowed
her
out
it
was
nearly
four
upon
a
damp
drizzling
afternoon
a
november
afternoon
that
hung
like
a
living
misery
over
the
black
slush
of
the
birmingham
streets
and
would
in
itself
have
sufficed
to
bring
the
lightest
hearted
happiest
mortal
to
the
very
gates
of
despair
when
augusta
wet
wearied
and
almost
crying
at
last
entered
the
door
of
their
little
she
entered
very
quietly
for
the
had
met
her
in
the
passage
and
told
her
that
miss
jeannie
was
asleep
she
had
been
coughing
very
much
about
but
now
she
was
asleep
there
was
a
fire
in
the
grate
a
small
one
for
the
coal
was
economised
by
means
of
two
large
and
on
a
table
augusta
writing
table
placed
at
the
further
side
of
the
room
was
a
turned
low
drawn
up
in
front
but
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
fire
was
a
sofa
covered
with
red
rep
and
on
the
sofa
lay
a
little
form
so
thin
and
fragile
that
it
looked
like
the
ghost
or
outline
of
a
girl
rather
than
a
girl
herself
it
was
jeannie
her
sick
sister
and
she
was
asleep
augusta
stole
softly
up
to
look
at
her
it
was
a
sweet
little
face
that
her
eyes
fell
on
although
it
was
so
shockingly
thin
with
long
curved
lashes
delicate
nostrils
and
a
mouth
shaped
like
a
bow
all
the
lines
and
grooves
which
the
chisel
of
pain
knows
so
well
how
to
carve
were
smoothed
out
of
it
now
and
in
their
place
lay
the
shadow
of
a
smile
augusta
looked
at
her
and
clenched
her
fists
while
a
lump
rose
in
her
throat
and
her
grey
eyes
filled
with
tears
how
could
she
get
the
money
to
save
her
the
year
before
a
rich
man
a
man
who
was
detestable
to
her
had
wanted
to
marry
her
and
she
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
he
had
gone
abroad
else
she
would
have
gone
back
to
him
and
married
him
at
a
price
marry
him
yes
she
would
marry
him
she
would
do
anything
for
money
to
take
her
sister
away
what
did
she
care
for
herself
when
her
darling
was
dying
dying
for
the
want
of
two
hundred
pounds
just
then
jeannie
woke
up
and
stretched
her
arms
out
to
her
so
you
are
back
at
last
dear
she
said
in
her
sweet
childish
voice
it
has
been
so
lonely
without
you
why
how
wet
you
are
take
off
your
jacket
at
once
gussie
or
you
will
soon
be
as
ill
as
and
here
she
broke
out
into
a
terrible
fit
of
coughing
that
seemed
to
shake
her
tender
frame
as
the
wind
shakes
a
reed
her
sister
turned
and
obeyed
and
then
came
and
sat
by
the
sofa
and
took
the
thin
little
hand
in
hers
well
gussie
and
how
did
you
get
on
with
the
this
was
her
impolite
name
for
the
great
meeson
will
he
give
you
any
more
money
no
dear
we
quarrelled
that
was
all
and
i
came
away
then
i
suppose
that
we
ca
go
abroad
augusta
was
too
moved
to
answer
she
only
shook
her
head
the
child
buried
her
face
in
the
pillow
and
gave
a
sob
or
two
presently
she
was
quiet
and
lifted
it
again
gussie
love
she
said
do
be
angry
but
i
want
to
speak
to
you
listen
my
sweet
gussie
my
angel
oh
gussie
you
do
know
how
i
love
you
it
is
all
no
good
it
is
useless
struggling
against
it
i
must
die
sooner
or
later
though
i
am
only
twelve
and
you
think
me
such
a
child
i
am
old
enough
to
understand
that
i
think
she
added
after
pausing
to
cough
that
pain
makes
one
old
i
feel
as
though
i
were
fifty
well
so
you
see
i
may
as
well
give
up
fighting
against
it
and
die
at
once
i
am
only
a
burden
and
anxiety
to
you
i
may
as
well
die
at
once
and
go
to
sleep
do
jeannie
do
said
her
sister
in
a
sort
of
cry
you
are
killing
me
jeannie
laid
her
hot
hand
upon
augusta
arm
try
and
listen
to
me
dear
she
said
even
if
it
hurts
because
i
do
so
want
to
say
something
why
should
you
be
so
frightened
about
me
can
any
place
that
i
can
go
be
worse
than
this
place
can
i
suffer
more
pain
anywhere
or
be
more
hurt
when
i
see
you
crying
think
how
wretched
it
has
all
been
there
has
only
been
one
beautiful
thing
in
our
lives
for
years
and
years
and
that
was
your
book
even
when
i
am
feeling
worst
when
my
chest
aches
you
know
i
grow
quite
happy
when
i
think
of
what
the
papers
wrote
about
you
the
and
the
and
the
and
the
rest
of
them
they
said
that
you
had
genius
true
genius
you
remember
and
that
they
expected
one
day
to
see
you
at
the
head
of
the
literature
of
the
time
or
near
it
the
ca
take
away
that
gussie
he
can
take
the
money
but
he
ca
say
that
he
wrote
the
book
though
she
added
with
a
touch
of
childish
spite
and
vivacity
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
if
he
could
and
then
there
were
those
letters
from
the
great
authors
up
in
london
yes
i
often
think
of
them
too
well
dearest
old
girl
the
best
of
it
is
that
i
know
it
is
all
true
i
i
ca
tell
you
how
that
you
will
be
a
great
woman
in
spite
of
all
the
meesons
in
creation
for
somehow
you
will
get
out
of
his
power
and
if
you
do
five
years
is
not
all
one
life
at
least
not
if
people
have
a
life
at
the
worst
he
can
only
take
all
the
money
and
then
when
you
are
great
and
rich
and
famous
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
when
the
people
turn
their
heads
as
you
come
into
the
room
like
we
used
to
at
school
when
the
missionary
came
to
lecture
i
know
that
you
will
think
of
me
because
you
wo
forget
me
as
some
sisters
do
and
of
how
years
and
years
before
so
long
ago
that
the
time
looks
quite
small
when
you
think
of
it
i
told
you
that
it
would
be
so
just
before
i
died
here
the
girl
who
had
been
speaking
with
a
curious
air
of
certainty
and
with
a
gravity
and
deliberation
extraordinary
for
one
so
young
suddenly
broke
off
to
cough
her
sister
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
her
and
clasping
her
in
her
arms
implored
her
in
broken
accents
not
to
talk
of
dying
jeannie
drew
augusta
golden
head
down
on
her
breast
and
stroked
it
very
well
gussie
i
wo
say
any
more
about
it
she
said
but
it
is
no
good
hiding
the
truth
dear
i
am
tired
of
fighting
against
it
it
is
no
good
none
at
all
anyhow
we
have
loved
each
other
very
much
dear
and
perhaps
somewhere
else
we
may
again
and
the
brave
little
heart
again
broke
down
and
overcome
by
the
prescience
of
approaching
separation
they
both
sobbed
bitterly
there
upon
the
sofa
presently
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
augusta
sprang
up
and
turned
to
hide
her
tears
it
was
the
bringing
the
tea
and
as
she
came
blundering
in
a
sense
of
the
irony
of
things
forced
itself
into
augusta
soul
here
they
were
plunged
into
the
most
terrible
sorrow
weeping
at
the
inevitable
approach
of
that
chill
end
and
still
appearances
must
be
kept
up
even
before
a
society
even
when
represented
by
a
can
not
do
away
with
the
intrusion
of
domestic
griefs
or
any
other
griefs
and
in
our
hearts
we
know
it
and
act
up
to
it
far
gone
indeed
must
we
be
in
mental
or
physical
agony
before
we
abandon
the
attempt
to
keep
up
appearances
augusta
drank
a
little
tea
and
ate
a
very
small
bit
of
as
in
the
case
of
meeson
the
events
of
the
day
had
not
tended
to
increase
her
appetite
jeannie
drank
a
little
milk
but
ate
nothing
when
this
form
had
been
gone
through
and
the
had
once
more
made
her
appearance
and
cleared
the
table
jeannie
spoke
again
gus
she
said
i
want
you
to
put
me
to
bed
and
then
come
and
read
to
me
out
of
vow
where
poor
jemima
dies
you
know
it
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
book
and
i
want
to
hear
it
again
her
sister
did
as
she
wished
and
taking
down
jemima
vow
copy
as
it
was
called
being
the
very
first
that
had
come
into
the
house
she
opened
it
at
the
part
jeannie
had
asked
for
and
read
aloud
keeping
her
voice
as
steady
as
she
could
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
scene
itself
was
as
powerful
as
it
was
pathetic
and
quite
sufficient
to
account
for
any
unseemly
exhibitions
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
reader
however
she
struggled
through
it
till
the
last
sentence
was
reached
it
ran
thus
and
so
jemima
stretched
out
her
hand
to
him
and
said
and
presently
knowing
that
she
had
now
kept
her
promise
and
being
happy
because
she
had
done
so
she
went
to
sleep
ah
murmured
the
child
who
listened
i
wish
that
i
was
as
good
as
jemima
but
though
i
have
no
vow
to
keep
i
can
say
and
i
can
go
to
sleep
augusta
made
no
answer
and
presently
jeannie
dozed
off
her
sister
looked
at
her
with
eager
affection
she
is
giving
up
she
said
to
herself
and
if
she
gives
up
she
will
die
i
know
it
it
is
because
we
are
not
going
away
how
can
i
get
the
money
now
that
that
horrible
man
is
gone
how
can
i
get
it
and
she
buried
her
head
in
her
hand
and
thought
presently
an
idea
struck
her
she
might
go
back
to
meeson
and
eat
her
words
and
sell
him
the
copyright
of
her
new
book
for
as
the
agreement
provided
that
would
not
be
enough
however
for
travelling
with
an
invalid
is
expensive
but
she
might
offer
to
bind
herself
over
to
him
for
a
term
of
years
as
a
tame
author
like
those
who
worked
in
the
hutches
she
was
sure
that
he
would
be
glad
to
get
her
if
only
he
could
do
so
at
his
own
price
it
would
be
slavery
worse
than
any
penal
servitude
and
even
now
she
shudders
at
the
prospect
of
prostituting
her
great
abilities
to
the
necessities
of
such
work
as
meeson
made
their
thousands
out
of
work
out
of
which
every
spark
of
originality
was
stamped
into
nothingness
as
though
it
were
the
mark
of
the
beast
yes
it
would
be
dreadful
it
would
break
her
heart
but
she
was
prepared
to
have
her
heart
broken
and
her
genius
wrung
out
of
her
by
inches
if
only
she
could
get
two
hundred
pounds
wherewith
to
take
jeannie
away
to
the
south
of
france
meeson
would
no
doubt
make
a
hard
bargain
the
hardest
he
could
but
still
if
she
would
consent
to
bind
herself
for
a
sufficient
number
of
years
at
a
sufficiently
low
salary
he
would
probably
advance
her
a
hundred
pounds
besides
the
hundred
for
the
copyright
of
the
new
book
and
so
having
made
up
her
mind
to
the
sacrifice
she
went
to
bed
and
wearied
out
with
misery
to
sleep
and
even
as
she
slept
a
presence
that
she
could
not
see
was
standing
near
her
bed
and
a
voice
that
she
could
not
hear
was
calling
through
the
gloom
another
mortal
had
bent
low
at
the
feet
of
that
unknown
god
whom
men
name
death
and
been
borne
away
on
his
rushing
pinions
into
the
spaces
of
the
hid
one
more
human
item
lay
still
and
stiff
one
more
account
was
closed
for
good
or
evil
the
echo
of
one
more
tread
had
passed
from
the
earth
for
ever
the
old
tragedy
in
which
all
must
take
a
part
had
repeated
itself
once
more
down
to
its
last
and
most
awful
scene
yes
the
grim
farce
was
played
out
and
the
little
actor
jeannie
was
white
in
death
just
at
the
dawn
augusta
dreamed
that
somebody
with
cold
breath
was
breathing
on
her
face
and
woke
up
with
a
start
and
listened
bed
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
she
could
generally
hear
her
movements
plainly
enough
for
the
sick
child
was
a
restless
sleeper
but
now
she
could
hear
nothing
not
even
the
faint
vibration
of
her
breath
the
silence
was
absolute
and
appalling
it
struck
tangibly
upon
her
sense
as
the
darkness
struck
upon
her
and
filled
her
with
a
numb
unreasoning
terror
she
slipped
out
of
bed
and
struck
a
match
in
another
few
seconds
she
was
standing
by
jeannie
white
little
bed
waiting
for
the
wick
of
the
candle
to
burn
up
presently
the
light
grew
jeannie
was
lying
on
her
side
her
white
face
resting
on
her
white
arm
her
eyes
were
wide
open
but
when
augusta
held
the
candle
near
her
she
did
not
shut
them
or
flinch
her
hand
too
oh
heavens
the
fingers
were
nearly
cold
then
augusta
understood
and
lifting
up
her
arms
in
agony
she
shrieked
till
the
whole
house
rang
chapter
iv
augusta
decision
on
the
second
day
following
the
death
of
poor
little
jeannie
smithers
eustace
meeson
was
strolling
about
birmingham
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
air
of
indecision
on
his
decidedly
agreeable
and
gentlemanlike
countenance
eustace
meeson
was
not
particularly
cast
down
by
the
extraordinary
reverse
of
fortune
which
he
had
recently
experienced
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
a
cheerful
nature
and
besides
it
did
not
so
very
much
matter
to
him
he
was
in
a
blessed
condition
of
celibacy
and
had
no
wife
and
children
dependant
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
somehow
or
other
it
would
go
hard
if
with
the
help
of
the
one
hundred
a
year
that
he
had
of
his
own
he
did
not
manage
with
his
education
to
get
a
living
by
hook
or
by
crook
so
it
was
not
the
loss
of
the
society
of
his
respected
uncle
or
the
prospective
enjoyment
of
two
millions
of
money
which
was
troubling
him
indeed
after
he
had
once
cleared
his
goods
and
chattels
out
of
pompadour
hall
and
settled
them
in
a
room
in
an
hotel
he
had
not
given
the
matter
much
thought
but
he
had
given
a
good
many
thoughts
to
augusta
smithers
grey
eyes
and
by
way
of
getting
an
insight
into
her
character
he
had
at
once
invested
in
a
copy
of
jemima
vow
thereby
somewhat
against
his
will
swelling
the
gains
of
meeson
to
the
extent
of
several
shillings
now
jemima
vow
though
simple
and
homely
was
a
most
striking
and
powerful
book
which
fully
deserved
the
reputation
that
it
had
gained
and
it
affected
eustace
who
was
in
so
much
different
from
most
young
men
of
his
age
that
he
really
did
know
the
difference
between
good
work
and
bad
more
strongly
than
he
would
have
liked
to
own
indeed
at
the
termination
of
the
story
what
between
the
beauty
of
augusta
pages
the
memory
of
augusta
eyes
and
the
knowledge
of
augusta
wrongs
eustace
meeson
began
to
feel
very
much
as
though
he
had
fallen
in
love
accordingly
he
went
out
walking
and
meeting
a
clerk
whom
he
had
known
in
the
meeson
establishment
one
of
those
who
had
been
discharged
on
the
same
day
as
himself
he
obtained
from
him
miss
smithers
address
and
began
to
reflect
as
to
whether
or
no
he
should
call
upon
her
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
he
continued
to
walk
till
he
reached
the
quiet
street
where
augusta
lived
and
suddenly
perceiving
the
house
of
which
the
clerk
had
told
him
yielded
to
temptation
and
rang
the
door
was
answered
by
the
who
looked
at
him
a
little
curiously
but
said
that
miss
smithers
was
in
and
then
conducted
him
to
a
door
which
was
half
open
and
left
him
in
that
kindly
and
agreeable
fashion
that
have
eustace
was
perplexed
and
looking
through
the
door
to
see
if
anyone
was
in
the
room
discovered
augusta
herself
dressed
in
some
dark
material
seated
in
a
chair
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
her
pale
face
set
like
a
stone
and
her
eyes
gleaming
into
vacancy
he
paused
wondering
what
could
be
the
matter
and
as
he
did
so
his
umbrella
slipped
from
his
hand
making
a
noise
that
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
declare
himself
augusta
rose
as
he
advanced
and
looked
at
him
with
a
puzzled
air
as
though
she
was
striving
to
recall
his
name
or
where
she
had
met
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
i
must
introduce
myself
as
the
girl
has
deserted
me
i
am
eustace
meeson
augusta
face
hardened
at
the
name
if
you
have
come
to
me
from
meeson
and
she
said
quickly
and
then
broke
off
as
though
struck
by
some
new
idea
indeed
no
said
eustace
i
have
nothing
in
common
with
meeson
now
except
my
name
and
i
have
only
come
to
tell
you
how
sorry
i
was
to
see
you
treated
as
you
were
by
my
uncle
you
remember
i
was
in
the
office
yes
she
said
with
a
suspicion
of
a
blush
i
remember
you
were
very
kind
well
you
see
he
went
on
i
had
a
great
row
with
my
uncle
after
that
and
it
ended
in
his
turning
me
out
of
the
place
bag
and
baggage
and
informing
me
that
he
was
going
to
cut
me
off
with
a
shilling
which
he
added
reflectively
he
has
probably
done
by
now
do
i
understand
you
meeson
to
mean
that
you
quarrelled
with
your
uncle
about
me
and
my
books
yes
that
is
so
he
said
it
was
very
chivalrous
of
you
she
answered
looking
at
him
with
a
curiosity
augusta
was
not
accustomed
to
find
thus
prepared
at
such
cost
to
themselves
to
break
a
lance
in
her
cause
least
of
all
was
she
prepared
to
find
that
knight
bearing
the
hateful
crest
of
meeson
if
indeed
meeson
had
a
crest
i
ought
to
apologise
she
went
on
presently
after
an
awkward
pause
for
making
such
a
scene
in
the
office
but
i
wanted
money
so
dreadfully
and
it
was
so
hard
to
be
refused
but
it
does
not
matter
now
it
is
all
done
with
there
was
a
dull
hopeless
ring
about
her
voice
that
awoke
his
curiosity
for
what
could
she
have
wanted
the
money
and
why
did
she
no
longer
want
it
i
am
sorry
he
said
will
you
tell
me
what
you
wanted
it
so
much
for
she
looked
at
him
and
then
acting
upon
impulse
rather
then
reflection
said
in
a
low
voice
if
you
like
i
will
show
you
he
bowed
wondering
what
was
coming
next
rising
from
her
chair
augusta
led
the
way
to
a
door
which
opened
out
of
the
and
gently
turned
the
handle
and
entered
eustace
followed
her
the
room
was
a
small
of
which
the
faded
calico
blind
had
been
pulled
down
as
it
happened
however
the
sunlight
such
as
it
was
beat
full
upon
the
blind
and
came
through
it
in
yellow
bars
they
fell
upon
the
furniture
of
the
bare
little
room
they
fell
upon
the
iron
bedstead
and
upon
something
lying
on
it
which
he
did
not
at
first
notice
because
it
was
covered
with
a
sheet
augusta
walked
up
to
the
bed
and
gently
lifted
the
sheet
revealing
the
sweet
face
fringed
round
about
with
golden
hair
of
little
jeannie
in
her
coffin
eustace
gave
an
exclamation
and
started
back
violently
he
had
not
been
prepared
for
such
a
sight
indeed
it
was
the
first
such
sight
that
he
had
ever
seen
and
it
shocked
him
beyond
words
augusta
familiarised
as
she
was
herself
with
the
companionship
of
this
beauteous
clay
cold
terror
had
forgotten
that
suddenly
and
without
warning
to
bring
the
living
into
the
presence
of
the
dead
is
not
the
wisest
or
the
kindest
thing
to
do
for
to
the
living
more
especially
to
the
young
the
sight
of
death
is
horrible
it
is
such
a
fearsome
comment
on
their
health
and
strength
youth
and
strength
are
merry
but
who
can
be
merry
with
yon
dead
thing
in
the
upper
chamber
take
it
away
thrust
it
underground
it
is
an
insult
to
us
it
reminds
us
that
we
too
die
like
others
what
business
has
its
pallor
to
show
itself
against
our
ruddy
cheeks
i
beg
your
pardon
whispered
augusta
realising
something
of
all
this
in
a
flash
i
forgot
you
do
not
know
you
must
be
shocked
forgive
me
who
is
it
he
said
gasping
to
get
back
his
breath
my
sister
she
answered
it
was
to
try
and
save
her
life
that
i
wanted
the
money
when
i
told
her
that
i
could
not
get
it
she
gave
up
and
died
your
uncle
killed
her
come
greatly
shocked
he
followed
her
back
into
the
and
then
as
soon
as
he
got
his
composure
apologised
for
having
intruded
himself
upon
her
in
such
an
hour
of
desolation
i
am
glad
to
see
you
she
said
simply
i
have
seen
nobody
except
the
doctor
once
and
the
undertaker
twice
it
is
dreadful
to
sit
alone
hour
after
hour
face
to
face
with
the
irretrievable
if
i
had
not
been
so
foolish
as
to
enter
into
that
agreement
with
meeson
i
could
have
got
the
money
by
selling
my
new
book
easily
enough
and
i
should
have
been
able
to
take
jeannie
abroad
and
i
believe
that
she
would
have
lived
at
least
i
hoped
so
but
now
it
is
finished
and
can
not
be
helped
i
wish
i
had
known
blundered
eustace
i
could
have
lent
you
the
money
i
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
you
are
very
good
she
answered
gently
but
it
is
no
use
talking
about
it
now
it
is
finished
then
eustace
rose
and
went
away
and
it
was
not
till
he
found
himself
in
the
street
that
he
remembered
that
he
had
never
asked
augusta
what
her
plans
were
indeed
the
sight
of
poor
jeannie
had
put
everything
else
out
of
his
head
however
he
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
he
could
call
again
a
week
or
ten
days
after
the
funeral
two
days
later
augusta
followed
the
remains
of
her
dearly
beloved
sister
to
their
last
resting
place
and
then
came
home
on
foot
for
she
was
the
only
mourner
and
sat
in
her
black
gown
before
the
little
fire
and
reflected
upon
her
position
what
was
she
to
do
she
could
not
stay
in
these
rooms
it
made
her
heart
ache
every
time
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
empty
sofa
opposite
dinted
as
it
was
with
the
accustomed
weight
of
poor
jeannie
frame
where
was
she
to
go
and
what
was
she
to
do
she
might
get
literary
employment
but
then
her
agreement
with
meeson
stared
her
in
the
face
that
agreement
was
very
widely
drawn
it
bound
her
to
offer
all
literary
work
of
any
sort
that
might
come
from
her
pen
during
the
next
five
years
to
meeson
at
the
fixed
rate
of
seven
per
cent
on
the
published
price
obviously
as
it
seemed
to
her
though
perhaps
erroneously
this
clause
might
be
stretched
to
include
even
a
newspaper
article
and
she
knew
the
malignant
nature
of
meeson
well
enough
to
be
quite
certain
that
if
possible
that
would
be
done
it
was
true
she
might
manage
to
make
a
bare
living
out
of
her
work
even
at
the
beggarly
pay
of
seven
per
cent
but
augusta
was
a
person
of
spirit
and
determined
that
she
would
rather
starve
than
that
meeson
should
again
make
huge
profits
out
of
her
labour
this
avenue
being
closed
to
her
she
turned
her
mind
elsewhere
but
look
where
she
might
the
prospect
was
equally
dark
augusta
remarkable
literary
success
had
not
been
of
much
practical
advantage
to
her
for
in
this
country
literary
success
does
not
mean
so
much
as
it
does
in
some
others
as
a
matter
of
fact
indeed
the
average
briton
has
at
heart
a
considerable
contempt
if
not
for
literature
at
least
for
those
who
produce
it
literature
in
his
mind
is
connected
with
the
idea
of
garrets
and
extreme
poverty
and
therefore
having
the
national
respect
for
money
he
in
secret
if
not
in
public
despises
it
a
tree
is
known
by
its
fruit
says
he
let
a
man
succeed
at
the
bar
and
he
makes
thousands
upon
thousands
a
year
and
is
promoted
to
the
highest
offices
in
the
state
let
a
man
succeed
in
art
and
he
will
be
paid
one
or
two
thousand
pounds
apiece
for
his
most
portraits
but
your
literary
men
why
with
a
few
fortunate
exceptions
the
best
of
them
barely
make
a
living
what
can
literature
be
worth
if
a
man
ca
make
a
fortune
out
of
it
so
argues
the
briton
no
doubt
with
some
of
his
sound
common
sense
not
that
he
has
no
respect
for
genius
all
men
bow
to
true
genius
even
when
they
fear
and
envy
it
but
he
thinks
a
good
deal
more
of
genius
dead
than
genius
living
however
this
may
be
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
if
through
any
cause
such
for
instance
as
the
sudden
discovery
by
the
great
and
highly
civilized
american
people
that
the
seventh
commandment
was
probably
intended
to
apply
to
authors
amongst
the
rest
of
the
world
the
pecuniary
rewards
of
literary
labor
should
be
put
more
upon
an
equality
with
those
of
other
trades
literature
as
a
profession
will
go
up
many
steps
in
popular
esteem
at
present
if
a
member
of
a
family
has
betaken
himself
to
the
high
and
honourable
calling
for
surely
it
is
both
of
letters
his
friends
and
relations
are
apt
to
talk
about
him
in
a
shy
and
diffident
not
to
say
apologetic
way
much
as
they
would
had
he
adopted
another
sort
of
as
a
means
of
livelihood
thus
it
was
that
notwithstanding
her
success
augusta
had
nowhere
to
turn
in
her
difficulty
she
had
absolutely
no
literary
connection
nobody
had
called
upon
her
and
sought
her
out
in
consequence
of
her
book
one
or
two
authors
in
london
and
a
few
unknown
people
from
different
parts
of
the
country
and
abroad
had
written
to
her
that
was
all
had
she
lived
in
town
it
might
have
been
different
but
unfortunately
for
her
she
did
not
the
more
she
thought
the
less
clear
did
her
path
become
until
at
last
she
got
an
inspiration
why
not
leave
england
altogether
she
had
nothing
to
keep
her
here
she
had
a
cousin
a
clergyman
in
new
zealand
whom
she
had
never
seen
but
who
had
read
jemima
vow
and
written
her
a
kind
letter
about
it
that
was
the
one
delightful
thing
about
writing
books
one
made
friends
all
over
the
world
surely
he
would
take
her
in
for
a
while
and
put
her
in
the
way
of
earning
a
living
where
meeson
would
not
be
to
molest
her
why
should
she
not
go
she
had
twenty
pounds
left
and
the
furniture
which
included
an
expensive
invalid
chair
and
books
would
fetch
another
thirty
or
so
enough
to
pay
for
a
passage
and
leave
a
few
pounds
in
her
pocket
at
the
worst
it
would
be
a
change
and
she
could
not
go
through
more
there
than
she
did
here
so
that
very
night
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
her
clergyman
cousin
chapter
the
kangaroo
it
was
on
a
tuesday
evening
that
a
mighty
vessel
was
steaming
majestically
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
thames
and
shaping
her
imposing
course
straight
at
the
ball
of
the
setting
sun
most
people
will
remember
reading
descriptions
of
the
steamship
kangaroo
and
being
astonished
at
the
power
of
her
engines
the
beauty
of
her
fittings
and
the
extraordinary
speed
about
eighteen
knots
which
she
developed
in
her
trials
with
an
unusually
low
expenditure
of
coal
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
not
however
it
may
be
stated
that
the
kangaroo
the
little
kangaroo
as
she
was
ironically
named
among
sailor
men
was
the
very
latest
development
of
the
science
of
modern
everything
about
her
from
the
electric
light
and
boiler
tubes
up
was
on
a
new
and
patent
system
four
hundred
feet
and
more
she
measured
from
stem
to
stern
and
in
that
space
were
crowded
and
packed
all
the
luxuries
of
a
palace
and
all
the
conveniences
of
an
american
hotel
she
was
a
beautiful
and
a
wonderful
thing
to
look
on
as
with
her
holds
full
of
costly
merchandise
and
her
decks
crowded
with
her
living
freight
of
about
a
thousand
human
beings
she
steamed
slowly
out
to
sea
as
though
loth
to
leave
the
land
where
she
was
born
but
presently
she
seemed
to
gather
up
her
energies
and
to
grow
conscious
of
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
of
wide
tossing
water
which
stretched
between
her
and
the
harbour
where
her
mighty
heart
should
cease
from
beating
and
be
for
a
while
at
rest
quicker
and
quicker
she
sped
along
and
spurned
the
churning
water
from
her
swift
sides
she
was
running
under
a
full
head
of
steam
now
and
the
of
england
grew
faint
and
low
in
the
faint
low
light
till
at
last
it
almost
vanished
from
the
gaze
of
a
tall
slim
girl
who
stood
forward
clinging
to
the
starboard
bulwark
netting
and
looking
with
deep
grey
eyes
across
the
waste
of
waters
presently
augusta
for
it
was
she
could
see
the
shore
no
more
and
turned
to
watch
the
other
passengers
and
think
she
was
sad
at
heart
poor
girl
and
felt
what
she
was
a
very
waif
upon
the
sea
of
life
not
that
she
had
much
to
regret
upon
the
vanished
a
little
grave
with
a
white
cross
over
it
that
was
all
she
had
left
no
friends
to
weep
for
her
none
but
even
as
she
thought
it
a
recollection
rose
up
in
her
mind
of
eustace
meeson
pleasant
handsome
face
and
of
his
kind
words
and
with
it
came
a
pang
as
she
reflected
that
in
all
probability
she
should
never
see
the
one
or
hear
the
other
again
why
she
wondered
had
he
not
come
to
see
her
again
she
should
have
liked
to
bid
him
and
had
half
a
mind
to
send
him
a
note
and
tell
him
of
her
going
this
on
second
thoughts
however
she
had
decided
not
to
do
for
one
thing
she
did
not
know
his
address
and
well
there
was
an
end
of
it
could
she
by
the
means
of
clairvoyance
have
seen
eustace
face
and
heard
his
words
she
would
have
regretted
her
decision
for
even
as
that
great
vessel
plunged
on
her
fierce
way
right
into
the
heart
of
the
gathering
darkness
he
was
standing
at
the
door
of
the
in
the
little
street
in
birmingham
gone
he
was
saying
miss
smithers
gone
to
new
zealand
what
is
her
address
she
did
leave
no
address
sir
replies
the
dirty
with
a
grin
she
went
from
here
two
days
ago
and
was
going
on
to
the
ship
in
london
what
was
the
name
of
the
ship
he
asked
in
despair
kan
kon
replies
the
girl
in
triumph
and
shuts
the
door
in
his
face
poor
eustace
he
had
gone
to
london
to
try
and
get
some
employment
and
having
after
some
difficulty
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
billet
as
reader
in
latin
french
and
english
to
a
publishing
house
of
good
repute
at
a
salary
of
a
year
he
had
hurried
back
to
birmingham
for
the
sole
purpose
of
seeing
miss
augusta
smithers
with
whom
if
the
whole
truth
must
be
told
he
had
to
his
credit
be
it
said
fallen
deeply
truly
and
violently
in
love
indeed
so
far
was
he
in
this
way
gone
that
he
had
determined
to
make
all
the
progress
that
he
could
and
if
he
thought
that
there
was
any
prospect
of
success
to
declare
his
passion
this
was
perhaps
a
little
premature
but
then
in
these
matters
people
are
apt
to
be
more
premature
than
is
generally
supposed
human
nature
is
very
swift
in
coming
to
conclusions
in
matters
in
which
that
strange
mixture
we
call
the
affections
are
involved
perhaps
because
although
the
conclusion
is
not
altogether
a
pleasing
one
the
affections
at
any
rate
in
the
beginning
are
largely
dependent
on
the
senses
pity
a
poor
young
man
to
come
from
london
to
birmingham
to
woo
mistress
in
a
carriage
too
and
find
her
gone
to
new
zealand
whither
circumstances
prevented
him
from
following
her
without
leaving
a
word
or
a
line
or
even
an
address
behind
her
it
was
too
bad
well
there
was
no
remedy
in
the
matter
so
he
walked
to
the
railway
station
and
groaned
and
swore
all
the
way
back
to
london
augusta
on
board
the
kangaroo
was
however
in
utter
ignorance
of
this
act
of
devotion
on
the
part
of
her
admirer
indeed
she
did
not
even
know
that
he
was
her
admirer
feeling
a
curious
sinking
sensation
within
her
she
was
about
to
go
below
to
her
cabin
which
she
shared
with
a
not
knowing
whether
to
attribute
it
to
sentimental
qualms
incidental
to
her
lonely
departure
from
the
land
of
her
birth
or
to
other
qualms
connected
with
the
first
experience
of
life
upon
the
ocean
wave
about
that
moment
however
a
burly
addressed
her
in
gruff
tones
and
informed
her
that
if
she
wanted
to
see
the
last
of
hold
halbion
she
had
better
go
aft
a
bit
and
look
over
the
port
side
and
she
would
see
the
something
or
other
light
accordingly
more
to
prove
to
herself
that
she
was
not
than
for
any
other
reason
she
did
so
and
standing
as
far
aft
as
the
passengers
were
allowed
to
go
stared
at
the
quick
flashes
of
the
as
second
by
second
they
sent
their
message
across
the
great
waste
of
sea
as
she
stood
there
holding
on
to
a
stanchion
to
steady
herself
for
the
vessel
large
as
she
was
had
begun
to
get
a
bit
of
a
roll
on
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
bulky
figure
of
a
man
which
came
running
or
rather
reeling
against
the
bulwarks
alongside
of
her
where
it
or
rather
he
was
instantly
and
violently
augusta
was
not
unnaturally
almost
horrified
into
following
the
figure
example
when
suddenly
growing
faint
or
from
some
other
cause
it
loosed
its
hold
and
rolled
into
the
scuppers
where
it
lay
feebly
swearing
augusta
obeying
a
tender
impulse
of
humanity
hurried
forward
and
stretched
out
the
hand
of
succour
and
presently
between
her
help
and
that
of
the
bulwark
netting
the
man
struggled
to
his
feet
as
he
did
so
his
face
came
close
to
hers
and
in
the
dim
light
she
recognised
the
fat
coarse
features
now
blanched
with
misery
of
meeson
the
publisher
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
it
was
her
enemy
the
man
whose
behavior
had
indirectly
as
she
believed
caused
the
death
of
her
little
sister
she
dropped
his
hand
with
an
exclamation
of
disgust
and
dismay
and
as
she
did
so
he
recognised
who
she
was
hullo
he
said
with
a
faint
and
rather
feeble
attempt
to
assume
his
fine
old
crusted
manners
hullo
miss
jemima
smithers
i
mean
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
i
am
going
to
new
zealand
meeson
she
answered
sharply
and
i
certainly
did
not
expect
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
company
on
the
voyage
going
to
new
zealand
he
said
are
you
why
so
am
i
at
least
i
am
going
there
first
then
to
australia
what
do
you
mean
to
do
there
try
and
run
round
our
little
agreement
eh
it
wo
be
any
good
i
tell
you
plainly
we
have
our
agents
in
new
zealand
and
a
house
in
australia
and
if
you
try
to
get
the
better
of
meeson
there
meeson
will
be
even
with
you
miss
smithers
oh
heavens
i
feel
as
though
i
were
coming
to
pieces
do
alarm
yourself
meeson
she
answered
i
am
not
going
to
publish
any
more
books
at
present
that
is
a
pity
he
said
because
your
stuff
is
good
selling
stuff
any
publisher
would
find
money
in
it
i
suppose
you
are
miss
smithers
so
we
sha
see
much
of
each
other
and
perhaps
if
we
should
meet
it
might
be
as
well
if
we
did
seem
to
have
any
acquaintance
it
do
look
well
for
a
man
in
my
position
to
know
passengers
especially
young
lady
passengers
who
write
novels
you
need
not
be
afraid
meeson
i
have
no
wish
to
claim
your
acquaintance
said
augusta
at
this
point
her
enemy
was
taken
violently
worse
again
and
being
unable
to
stand
the
sight
and
sound
of
his
writhing
and
groaning
she
fled
forward
and
reflecting
on
this
strange
and
awkward
meeting
went
down
to
her
own
berth
where
with
lucid
intervals
she
remained
helpless
and
half
stupid
for
the
next
three
days
on
the
fourth
day
however
she
reappeared
on
deck
quite
recovered
and
with
an
excellent
appetite
she
had
her
breakfast
and
then
went
and
sat
forward
in
as
quiet
a
place
as
she
could
find
she
did
not
want
to
see
meeson
any
more
and
she
did
want
to
escape
from
the
stories
of
her
the
this
good
person
would
after
the
manner
of
her
kind
insist
upon
repeating
to
her
a
succession
of
histories
connected
with
members
of
the
families
with
whom
she
had
lived
many
of
which
were
sufficient
to
make
the
hair
of
a
respectable
young
lady
like
augusta
stand
positively
on
end
no
doubt
they
were
interesting
to
her
in
her
capacity
of
a
novelist
but
as
they
were
all
of
the
same
colour
and
as
their
tendency
was
absolutely
to
destroy
any
belief
she
might
have
in
virtue
as
an
inherent
quality
in
highly
developed
woman
or
honour
in
man
augusta
soon
wearied
of
these
so
she
went
forward
and
was
sitting
looking
at
the
white
horses
chasing
each
other
across
the
watery
plain
and
reflecting
upon
what
the
condition
of
mind
of
those
ladies
whose
histories
she
had
recently
heard
would
be
if
they
knew
that
their
most
secret
and
in
some
cases
disgraceful
and
tragic
love
affairs
were
the
common
talk
of
a
dozen
servants
halls
when
suddenly
she
was
astonished
by
the
appearance
of
a
splendid
official
bearing
a
book
at
first
from
the
quantity
of
gold
lace
with
which
his
uniform
was
adorned
augusta
took
him
to
be
the
captain
but
it
presently
transpired
that
he
was
only
the
chief
steward
please
miss
he
said
touching
his
hat
and
holding
out
the
book
in
his
hand
towards
her
the
captain
sends
his
compliments
and
wants
to
know
if
you
are
the
young
lady
who
wrote
this
augusta
glanced
at
the
work
it
was
a
copy
of
jemima
vow
then
she
replied
that
she
was
the
writer
of
it
and
the
steward
vanished
later
on
in
the
morning
came
another
surprise
the
gorgeous
official
again
appeared
touched
his
cap
and
said
that
the
captain
desired
him
to
say
that
orders
had
been
given
to
have
her
things
moved
to
a
cabin
further
aft
at
first
augusta
demurred
to
this
not
from
any
love
of
the
but
because
she
had
a
truly
british
objection
to
being
ordered
about
captain
orders
miss
said
the
man
touching
his
cap
again
and
she
yielded
nor
had
she
any
cause
to
regret
doing
so
for
to
her
huge
delight
she
found
herself
moved
into
a
charming
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
vessel
some
little
way
abaft
the
it
was
evidently
an
officer
cabin
for
there
over
the
head
of
the
bed
was
the
picture
of
a
young
lady
he
adored
and
also
some
neatly
fitted
shelves
of
books
a
rack
of
telescopes
and
other
contrivances
am
i
to
have
this
cabin
to
myself
asked
augusta
of
the
steward
yes
miss
those
are
the
captain
orders
it
is
jones
cabin
jones
is
the
second
officer
but
he
has
turned
in
with
thomas
the
first
officer
and
given
up
the
cabin
to
you
i
am
sure
it
very
kind
of
jones
murmured
augusta
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
this
turn
of
fortune
but
surprises
were
not
to
end
there
a
few
minutes
afterwards
just
as
she
was
leaving
the
cabin
a
gentleman
in
uniform
came
up
in
whom
she
recognized
the
captain
he
was
accompanied
by
a
pretty
woman
very
becomingly
dressed
excuse
me
miss
smithers
i
believe
he
said
with
a
bow
yes
i
am
captain
alton
i
hope
you
like
your
new
cabin
let
me
introduce
you
to
lady
holmhurst
wife
of
lord
holmhurst
the
new
zealand
governor
you
know
lady
holmhurst
this
is
miss
smithers
whose
book
you
were
talking
so
much
about
oh
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
smithers
said
the
great
lady
in
a
manner
that
evidently
was
not
assumed
captain
alton
has
promised
that
i
shall
sit
next
to
you
at
dinner
and
then
we
can
have
a
good
talk
i
do
know
when
i
have
been
so
much
delighted
with
anything
as
i
was
with
your
book
i
have
read
it
three
times
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
busy
woman
i
think
there
is
some
mistake
said
augusta
hurriedly
and
with
a
slight
blush
i
am
a
passenger
on
board
this
ship
and
therefore
can
not
have
the
pleasure
of
sitting
next
to
lady
holmhurst
oh
that
is
all
right
miss
smithers
said
the
captain
with
a
jolly
laugh
you
are
my
guest
and
i
shall
take
no
denial
when
we
find
genius
for
once
in
our
lives
we
are
not
going
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
sitting
at
its
feet
added
lady
holmhurst
with
a
little
movement
towards
her
which
was
neither
curtsey
nor
bow
but
rather
a
happy
combination
of
both
the
compliment
was
augusta
felt
sincere
however
much
it
exaggerated
the
measure
of
her
poor
capacities
and
putting
other
things
aside
was
coming
as
it
did
from
one
woman
to
another
peculiarly
graceful
and
surprising
she
blushed
and
bowed
scarcely
knowing
what
to
say
when
suddenly
meeson
harsh
tones
pitched
just
now
in
a
respectful
key
broke
upon
her
ear
meeson
was
addressing
no
less
a
person
than
lord
holmhurst
lord
holmhurst
was
a
stout
short
dark
little
man
with
a
somewhat
pompous
manner
and
a
kindly
face
he
was
a
colonial
governor
of
the
first
water
and
was
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
now
a
colonial
governor
even
though
he
be
a
when
he
is
at
home
is
not
a
name
to
conjure
with
and
does
not
fill
an
exclusive
place
in
the
eye
of
the
english
world
there
are
many
colonial
governors
in
the
present
and
past
tense
to
be
found
in
the
purlieus
of
south
kensington
where
their
presence
creates
no
unusual
excitement
but
when
one
of
this
honourable
corps
sets
foot
upon
the
vessel
destined
to
bear
him
to
the
shores
that
he
shall
rule
all
this
changes
he
puts
off
the
body
of
the
ordinary
betitled
individual
and
puts
on
the
body
of
the
celestial
brotherhood
in
short
from
being
nobody
out
of
the
common
he
becomes
and
very
properly
so
a
great
man
nobody
knew
this
better
than
lord
holmhurst
and
to
a
person
fond
of
observing
such
things
nothing
could
have
been
more
curious
to
notice
than
the
small
but
gradual
increase
of
the
pomposity
of
his
manner
as
the
great
ship
day
by
day
steamed
further
from
england
and
nearer
to
the
country
where
he
was
king
it
went
up
degree
by
degree
like
a
thermometer
which
is
taken
down
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
or
gradually
removed
into
the
sunlight
at
present
however
the
thermometer
was
only
rising
i
was
repeating
my
lord
said
the
harsh
voice
of
meeson
that
the
principle
of
an
hereditary
peerage
is
the
grandest
principle
our
country
has
yet
developed
it
gives
us
something
to
look
forward
to
in
one
generation
we
make
the
money
in
the
next
we
take
the
title
which
the
money
buys
look
at
your
lordship
your
lordship
is
now
in
a
proud
position
but
as
i
have
understood
your
lordship
father
was
a
trader
like
me
hum
well
not
exactly
meeson
broke
in
lord
holmhurst
dear
me
i
wonder
who
that
exceedingly
girl
lady
holmhurst
is
talking
to
can
be
now
your
lordship
to
put
a
case
went
on
the
remorseless
meeson
who
like
most
people
of
his
stamp
had
an
almost
superstitious
veneration
for
the
aristocracy
i
have
made
a
great
deal
of
money
as
i
do
not
mind
telling
your
lordship
what
is
there
to
prevent
my
successor
supposing
i
have
a
successor
from
taking
advantage
of
that
money
and
rising
on
it
to
a
similar
position
to
that
so
worthily
occupied
by
your
lordship
exactly
meeson
a
most
excellent
idea
for
your
successor
excuse
me
but
i
see
lady
holmhurst
beckoning
to
me
and
he
fled
precipitately
still
followed
by
meeson
john
my
dear
said
lady
holmhurst
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
miss
smithers
miss
smithers
whom
we
have
all
been
talking
about
and
whose
book
you
have
been
reading
miss
smithers
my
husband
lord
holmhurst
who
when
he
was
not
deep
in
the
affairs
of
state
had
a
considerable
eye
for
a
pretty
girl
and
what
man
worthy
of
the
name
has
not
bowed
most
politely
and
was
proceeding
to
tell
augusta
in
very
charming
language
how
delighted
he
was
to
make
her
acquaintance
when
meeson
arrived
on
the
scene
and
perceived
augusta
for
the
first
time
quite
taken
aback
at
finding
her
apparently
upon
the
very
best
of
terms
with
people
of
such
quality
he
hesitated
to
consider
what
course
to
adopt
whereon
lady
holmhurst
in
a
somewhat
formal
way
for
she
was
not
very
fond
of
meeson
mistaking
his
hesitation
went
on
to
introduce
him
thereupon
all
in
a
moment
as
we
do
sometimes
take
such
resolutions
augusta
came
to
a
determination
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
meeson
she
would
repudiate
him
then
and
there
come
what
would
of
it
so
as
he
advanced
upon
her
with
outstretched
hand
she
drew
herself
up
and
in
a
cold
and
determined
voice
said
i
already
know
meeson
lady
holmhurst
and
i
do
not
wish
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
meeson
has
not
behaved
well
to
me
my
word
murmured
lord
holmhurst
to
himself
i
do
wonder
she
has
had
enough
of
him
sensible
young
woman
that
lady
holmhurst
looked
a
little
astonished
and
a
little
amused
suddenly
however
a
light
broke
upon
her
oh
i
see
she
said
i
suppose
that
meeson
published
vow
of
course
that
accounts
for
it
why
i
declare
there
is
the
dinner
bell
come
along
miss
smithers
or
we
shall
lose
the
place
the
captain
has
promised
us
and
accordingly
they
went
leaving
meeson
who
had
not
yet
realized
the
unprecedented
nature
of
the
position
positively
gasping
on
the
deck
and
on
board
the
kangaroo
there
were
no
clerks
and
editors
on
whom
he
could
wreck
his
wrath
and
now
my
dear
miss
smithers
said
lady
holmhurst
when
dinner
being
over
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
moonlight
near
the
wheel
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
why
you
do
like
meeson
whom
i
personally
detest
but
do
if
you
do
wish
to
you
know
but
augusta
did
wish
to
and
then
and
there
she
unfolded
her
whole
sad
story
into
her
friend
sympathetic
ear
and
glad
enough
the
poor
girl
was
to
find
a
confidant
to
whom
she
could
unbosom
her
sorrows
well
upon
my
word
said
lady
holmhurst
when
she
had
listened
with
tears
in
her
eyes
to
the
history
of
poor
little
jeannie
death
upon
my
word
of
all
the
brutes
i
ever
heard
of
i
think
that
this
publisher
of
yours
is
the
worst
i
will
cut
him
and
get
my
husband
to
cut
him
too
but
no
i
have
a
better
plan
than
that
he
shall
tear
up
that
agreement
so
sure
as
my
name
is
bessie
holmhurst
he
shall
tear
it
up
or
or
and
she
nodded
her
little
head
with
an
air
of
infinite
wisdom
chapter
vi
tombey
goes
forward
from
that
day
forward
the
voyage
on
the
kangaroo
was
until
the
last
dread
catastrophe
a
very
happy
one
for
augusta
lord
and
lady
holmhurst
made
much
of
her
and
all
the
rest
of
the
passengers
followed
suit
and
soon
she
found
herself
the
most
popular
character
on
board
the
two
copies
of
her
book
that
there
were
on
the
ship
were
passed
on
from
hand
to
hand
till
they
would
hardly
hang
together
and
really
at
last
she
got
quite
tired
of
hearing
of
her
own
creations
but
this
was
not
all
augusta
was
it
will
be
remembered
an
exceedingly
pretty
woman
and
melancholy
as
the
fact
may
seem
it
still
remains
a
fact
that
a
pretty
woman
is
in
the
eyes
of
most
people
a
more
interesting
object
than
a
man
or
than
a
lady
who
is
not
built
that
way
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
what
between
her
youth
her
beauty
her
talent
and
her
misfortunes
for
lady
holmhurst
had
not
exactly
kept
that
history
to
herself
augusta
was
all
of
a
sudden
elevated
into
the
position
of
a
perfect
heroine
it
really
almost
frightened
the
poor
girl
who
had
been
accustomed
to
nothing
but
sorrow
and
grinding
poverty
to
suddenly
find
herself
in
this
strange
position
with
every
man
on
board
that
great
vessel
at
her
beck
and
call
but
she
was
human
and
therefore
of
course
she
enjoyed
it
it
something
when
one
has
been
wandering
for
hour
after
hour
in
the
wet
and
melancholy
night
suddenly
to
see
the
fair
dawn
breaking
and
burning
overhead
and
to
know
that
the
worst
is
over
for
now
there
will
be
light
whereby
to
set
our
feet
it
is
something
too
to
the
most
christian
soul
to
utterly
and
completely
triumph
over
one
who
had
done
all
in
his
power
to
crush
and
destroy
you
whose
grasping
greed
has
indirectly
been
the
cause
of
the
death
of
the
person
you
loved
best
in
the
whole
world
round
and
she
did
triumph
as
meeson
conduct
to
her
got
about
the
little
society
of
the
ship
which
was
after
all
a
very
fair
example
of
all
society
in
miniature
fell
away
from
this
publishing
prince
and
not
even
the
jingling
of
his
could
lure
it
back
he
the
great
the
practically
omnipotent
the
owner
of
two
millions
and
the
hard
master
of
hundreds
upon
whose
toil
he
battened
was
practically
even
the
clerk
who
was
going
out
on
a
chance
of
getting
a
place
in
a
new
zealand
bank
would
have
nothing
to
say
to
him
and
what
is
more
he
felt
it
more
even
than
an
ordinary
individual
would
have
done
he
the
as
poor
little
jeannie
used
to
call
him
he
to
be
slighted
and
flouted
by
a
pack
of
people
whom
he
could
buy
up
three
times
over
and
all
on
account
of
a
wretched
authoress
an
authoress
if
you
please
it
made
meeson
very
wild
a
state
of
affairs
which
was
brought
to
a
climax
when
one
morning
lord
holmhurst
who
had
for
several
days
been
showing
a
growing
dislike
to
his
society
actually
almost
cut
him
dead
that
is
he
did
not
notice
his
outstretched
hand
and
passed
him
with
a
slight
bow
never
mind
my
lord
never
mind
muttered
meeson
after
that
somewhat
pompous
but
amiable
nobleman
retreating
form
we
see
if
i
ca
come
square
with
you
i
a
dog
who
can
pull
a
string
or
two
in
the
english
press
i
am
those
who
have
the
money
and
have
got
a
hold
of
people
so
that
they
must
write
what
they
tell
them
ai
people
to
be
cut
by
any
colonial
governor
my
lord
and
in
his
anger
he
fairly
shook
his
fist
at
the
unconscious
peer
seem
to
be
a
little
out
of
temper
meeson
said
a
voice
at
his
elbow
the
owner
of
which
was
a
big
young
man
with
hard
but
kindly
features
and
a
large
moustache
what
has
the
governor
been
doing
to
you
doing
tombey
he
been
cutting
me
that
all
me
meeson
cutting
me
as
dead
as
offal
or
something
like
it
i
held
out
my
hand
and
he
looked
right
over
it
and
marched
by
ah
said
tombey
who
was
a
wealthy
new
zealand
landowner
and
now
why
do
you
suppose
he
did
that
why
i
tell
you
why
it
all
about
that
girl
miss
smithers
do
you
mean
said
tombey
the
big
with
a
curious
flash
of
his
eyes
yes
miss
smithers
she
wrote
a
book
and
i
bought
the
book
for
fifty
pounds
and
stuck
a
clause
in
that
she
should
give
me
the
right
to
publish
anything
she
wrote
for
five
years
at
a
price
a
common
sort
of
thing
enough
in
one
way
and
another
when
you
are
dealing
with
some
idiot
who
do
know
any
better
well
as
it
happened
this
book
sold
like
and
in
time
the
young
lady
comes
to
me
and
wants
more
money
wants
to
get
out
of
the
hanging
clause
in
the
agreement
wants
everything
like
a
female
oliver
twist
and
when
i
say
you
do
loses
her
temper
and
makes
a
scene
and
it
turns
out
that
what
she
wanted
the
money
for
was
to
take
a
sick
sister
or
cousin
or
aunt
or
someone
out
of
england
and
when
she
could
not
do
it
and
the
relation
died
then
she
emigrates
and
goes
and
tells
the
people
on
board
ship
that
it
is
all
my
fault
and
i
suppose
that
that
is
a
conclusion
that
you
do
not
feel
drawn
to
mr
meeson
no
tombey
i
do
business
is
business
and
if
i
happen
to
have
got
to
windward
of
the
young
woman
why
so
much
the
better
for
me
getting
her
experience
that
all
and
she
ai
the
first
and
wo
be
the
last
but
if
she
goes
saying
much
more
about
me
i
go
for
her
for
slander
that
sure
on
the
legal
ground
that
the
greater
the
truth
the
greater
the
libel
i
presume
confound
her
went
on
meeson
without
noticing
his
remark
and
contracting
his
heavy
eyebrows
there
no
end
to
the
trouble
she
has
brought
on
me
i
quarrelled
with
my
nephew
about
her
and
now
dragging
my
name
through
the
dirt
here
and
i
bet
the
story
will
go
all
over
new
zealand
and
australia
yes
said
tombey
i
fancy
you
will
find
it
take
a
lot
of
choking
and
now
meeson
with
your
permission
i
will
say
a
word
and
try
and
throw
a
new
light
upon
a
very
perplexing
matter
it
never
seems
to
have
occurred
to
you
what
an
blackguard
you
are
so
i
may
as
well
put
it
to
you
plainly
if
you
are
not
a
thief
you
are
at
least
a
very
imitation
you
take
a
girl
book
and
make
hundreds
upon
hundreds
out
of
it
and
give
her
fifty
you
tie
her
down
so
as
to
provide
for
successful
swindling
of
the
same
sort
during
future
years
and
then
when
she
comes
to
beg
a
few
pounds
of
you
you
show
her
the
door
and
now
you
wonder
meeson
that
respectable
people
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
you
well
now
i
tell
you
opinion
is
that
the
only
society
to
which
you
would
be
really
suited
is
that
of
good
morning
and
the
large
young
man
walked
off
his
very
moustachios
curling
with
wrath
and
contempt
thus
for
a
second
time
did
the
great
meeson
hear
the
truth
from
the
lips
of
babes
and
sucklings
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
disinherit
number
two
as
he
had
number
one
now
this
will
strike
the
reader
as
being
very
warm
advocacy
on
the
part
of
tombey
who
being
called
in
to
console
and
bless
cursed
with
such
extraordinary
vigour
it
may
even
strike
the
discerning
reader
and
all
readers
or
at
least
nearly
all
readers
are
of
course
discerning
far
too
much
so
indeed
that
there
must
have
been
a
reason
for
it
and
the
discerning
reader
will
be
right
augusta
grey
eyes
had
been
too
much
for
tombey
as
they
had
been
too
much
for
eustace
meeson
before
him
his
passion
had
sprung
up
and
ripened
in
that
peculiarly
rapid
and
vigorous
fashion
that
passions
do
on
board
ship
a
passenger
steamer
is
cupid
own
and
in
this
way
differs
from
a
on
the
indeed
the
preliminary
stages
are
the
same
the
seed
roots
as
strongly
and
grows
and
flowers
with
equal
vigour
but
here
comes
the
melancholy
part
it
withers
and
decays
with
equal
rapidity
the
voyage
is
too
long
too
much
is
mutually
revealed
the
matrimonial
iron
can
not
be
struck
while
it
is
hot
and
long
before
the
weary
ninety
days
are
over
it
is
once
more
cold
and
black
or
at
the
best
glows
with
but
a
feeble
heat
but
on
the
steamship
there
is
no
time
for
this
as
any
traveller
knows
myself
i
the
historian
have
with
my
own
eyes
seen
a
couple
meet
for
the
first
time
at
maderia
get
married
at
the
cape
and
go
on
as
man
and
wife
in
the
same
vessel
to
natal
and
therefore
it
came
to
pass
that
very
evening
a
touching
and
on
the
whole
melancholy
little
scene
was
enacted
near
the
of
the
kangaroo
tombey
and
miss
augusta
smithers
were
leaning
together
over
the
bulwarks
and
watching
the
phosphorescent
foam
go
flashing
past
tombey
was
nervous
and
ill
at
ease
miss
smithers
very
much
at
ease
and
reflecting
that
her
companion
moustachios
would
very
well
become
a
villain
in
a
novel
tombey
looked
at
the
sky
on
which
the
southern
cross
hung
low
and
he
looked
at
the
phosphorescent
sea
but
from
neither
did
inspiration
come
inspiration
is
from
within
and
not
from
without
at
last
however
he
made
a
gallant
and
a
desperate
effort
miss
smithers
he
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
agitation
yes
tombey
answered
augusta
quietly
what
is
it
miss
smithers
he
went
on
miss
augusta
i
do
know
what
you
will
think
of
me
but
i
must
tell
you
i
ca
keep
it
any
longer
i
love
you
augusta
fairly
jumped
tombey
had
been
very
even
markedly
polite
and
she
not
being
a
fool
had
seen
that
he
admired
her
but
she
had
never
expected
this
and
the
suddenness
with
which
the
shot
was
fired
was
somewhat
bewildering
why
tombey
she
said
in
a
surprised
voice
you
have
only
known
me
for
a
little
more
than
a
fortnight
i
fell
in
love
with
you
when
i
had
only
known
you
for
an
hour
he
answered
with
evident
sincerity
please
listen
to
me
i
know
i
am
not
worthy
of
you
but
i
do
love
you
so
very
dearly
and
i
would
make
you
a
good
husband
indeed
i
would
i
am
well
off
though
of
course
that
is
nothing
and
if
you
do
like
new
zealand
i
would
give
it
up
and
go
to
live
in
england
do
you
think
that
you
can
take
me
if
you
only
knew
how
dearly
i
love
you
i
am
sure
you
would
augusta
collected
her
wits
as
well
as
she
could
the
man
evidently
did
love
her
there
was
no
doubting
the
sincerity
of
his
words
and
she
liked
him
and
he
was
a
gentleman
if
she
married
him
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
her
worries
and
troubles
and
she
could
rest
contentedly
on
his
strong
arm
woman
even
gifted
woman
is
not
made
to
fight
the
world
with
her
own
hand
and
the
prospect
had
allurements
but
while
she
thought
eustace
meeson
bonny
face
rose
before
her
eyes
and
as
it
did
so
a
faint
feeling
of
repulsion
to
the
man
who
was
pleading
with
her
took
form
and
colour
in
her
breast
eustace
meeson
of
course
was
nothing
to
her
no
word
or
sign
of
affection
had
passed
between
them
and
the
probability
was
that
she
would
never
set
her
eyes
upon
him
again
and
yet
that
face
rose
up
between
her
and
this
man
who
was
pleading
at
her
side
many
women
likely
enough
have
seen
some
such
vision
from
the
past
and
have
disregarded
it
only
to
find
too
late
that
that
which
is
thrust
aside
is
not
necessarily
hidden
for
alas
those
faces
of
our
departed
youth
have
an
uncanny
trick
of
rising
from
the
tomb
of
our
forgetfulness
but
augusta
was
not
of
the
great
order
of
opportunists
because
a
thing
might
be
convenient
it
did
not
according
to
the
dictates
of
her
moral
sense
follow
that
it
was
lawful
therefore
she
was
a
woman
to
be
respected
for
a
woman
who
except
under
most
exceptional
circumstances
gives
her
instincts
the
lie
in
order
to
pander
to
her
convenience
or
her
desire
for
wealth
and
social
ease
is
not
altogether
a
woman
to
be
respected
in
a
very
few
seconds
she
had
made
up
her
mind
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
tombey
she
said
you
have
done
me
a
great
honour
the
greatest
honour
man
can
do
to
a
woman
but
i
can
not
marry
you
are
you
sure
gasped
the
unfortunate
tombey
for
his
hopes
had
been
high
is
there
no
hope
for
me
perhaps
there
is
somebody
else
there
is
nobody
else
tombey
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
you
do
know
how
much
it
pains
me
to
say
it
i
can
not
hold
out
any
prospect
that
i
shall
change
my
mind
he
dropped
his
head
upon
his
hands
for
a
minute
and
then
lifted
it
again
very
well
he
said
slowly
it
ca
be
helped
i
never
loved
any
woman
before
and
i
never
shall
again
it
is
a
pity
with
a
hard
little
laugh
that
so
much
affection
should
be
wasted
but
there
you
are
it
is
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
pleasant
experiences
which
make
up
our
lives
miss
smithers
at
least
as
a
friend
we
can
still
be
friends
she
faltered
oh
no
he
answered
with
another
laugh
that
is
an
exploded
notion
friendship
of
that
nature
is
not
very
safe
under
any
circumstances
certainly
not
under
these
the
relationship
is
antagonistic
to
the
facts
of
life
and
the
friends
or
one
or
other
of
them
will
drift
either
into
indifference
and
dislike
or
something
warmer
you
are
a
novelist
miss
smithers
perhaps
some
day
you
will
write
a
book
to
explain
why
people
fall
in
love
where
their
affection
is
not
wanted
and
what
purpose
their
distress
can
possibly
serve
and
now
once
more
good
bye
and
he
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
and
gently
kissed
it
and
then
with
a
bow
turned
and
went
from
all
of
which
it
will
be
clearly
seen
that
tombey
was
decidedly
a
young
man
above
the
average
and
one
who
took
punishment
very
well
augusta
looked
after
him
and
sighed
deeply
and
even
wiped
away
a
tear
then
she
turned
and
walked
aft
to
where
lady
holmhurst
was
sitting
enjoying
the
balmy
southern
air
through
which
the
great
ship
was
rushing
with
outspread
sails
like
some
huge
white
bird
and
chatting
to
the
captain
as
she
came
up
the
captain
made
his
bow
and
departed
saying
that
he
had
something
to
see
to
and
for
a
minute
lady
holmhurst
and
augusta
were
left
alone
well
augusta
said
lady
holmhurst
for
she
called
her
augusta
now
and
what
have
you
done
with
that
young
man
tombey
that
very
nice
young
man
she
added
with
emphasis
i
think
that
tombey
went
forward
said
augusta
the
two
women
looked
at
each
other
and
womanlike
each
understood
what
the
other
meant
lady
holmhurst
had
not
been
altogether
innocent
in
the
tombey
affair
lady
holmhurst
said
augusta
taking
the
bull
by
the
horns
tombey
has
been
speaking
to
me
and
has
proposed
to
you
suggested
lady
holmhurst
admiring
the
southern
cross
through
her
eyeglasses
you
said
he
went
forward
you
know
has
proposed
to
me
answered
augusta
ignoring
the
little
joke
i
regret
she
went
on
hurriedly
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
fall
in
with
tombey
plans
ah
said
lady
holmhurst
i
am
sorry
for
some
things
tombey
is
such
a
very
nice
young
man
and
so
very
gentlemanlike
i
thought
that
perhaps
it
might
suit
your
views
and
it
would
have
simplified
your
future
arrangements
but
as
to
that
of
course
while
you
are
in
new
zealand
i
shall
be
able
to
see
to
that
it
is
understood
that
you
come
to
stay
with
us
for
a
few
months
at
government
house
before
you
hunt
up
your
cousin
you
are
very
good
to
me
lady
holmhurst
said
augusta
with
something
like
a
sob
suppose
my
dear
answered
the
great
lady
laying
her
little
hand
upon
augusta
beautiful
hair
that
you
were
to
drop
the
holmhurst
and
call
me
it
sounds
so
much
more
sociable
you
know
and
besides
it
is
shorter
and
does
not
waste
so
much
breath
then
augusta
sobbed
outright
for
her
nerves
were
shaken
you
do
know
what
your
kindness
means
to
me
she
said
i
have
never
had
a
friend
and
since
my
darling
died
i
have
been
so
very
lonely
chapter
vii
the
catastrophe
and
so
these
two
fair
women
talked
making
plans
for
the
future
as
though
all
things
endured
forever
and
all
plans
were
destined
to
be
realized
but
even
as
they
talked
somewhere
up
in
the
high
heavens
the
voice
that
rules
the
world
spoke
a
word
and
the
messenger
of
fate
rushed
forth
to
do
its
bidding
on
board
the
great
ship
was
music
and
laughter
and
the
sweet
voices
of
singing
women
but
above
it
hung
a
pall
of
doom
not
the
most
timid
heart
dreamed
of
danger
what
danger
could
there
be
aboard
of
that
grand
ship
which
sped
across
the
waves
with
the
lightness
and
confidence
of
the
swallow
there
was
naught
to
fear
a
prosperous
voyage
was
drawing
to
its
end
and
mothers
put
their
babes
to
sleep
with
as
sure
a
heart
as
though
they
were
on
solid
english
ground
oh
surely
when
his
overflowing
load
of
sorrows
and
dire
miseries
was
meted
out
to
man
some
gentle
spirit
pleaded
for
him
that
he
should
not
have
foresight
added
to
the
tale
that
he
should
not
see
the
falling
knife
or
hear
the
water
lapping
that
one
day
shall
entomb
him
or
was
it
kept
back
because
man
having
knowledge
would
be
man
without
reason
for
terror
would
make
him
mad
and
he
would
end
his
fears
by
hurrying
their
fulfilment
at
least
we
are
blind
to
the
future
and
let
us
be
thankful
for
it
presently
lady
holmhurst
got
up
from
her
chair
and
said
that
she
was
going
to
bed
but
that
first
of
all
she
must
kiss
dick
her
little
boy
who
slept
with
his
nurse
in
another
cabin
augusta
rose
and
went
with
her
and
they
both
kissed
the
sleeping
child
a
bonny
boy
of
five
and
then
they
kissed
each
other
and
separated
for
the
night
some
hours
afterwards
augusta
woke
up
feeling
very
restless
for
an
hour
or
more
she
lay
thinking
of
tombey
and
many
other
things
and
listening
to
the
swift
lap
lap
of
the
water
as
it
slipped
past
the
vessel
sides
and
the
occasional
tramp
of
the
watch
as
they
set
fresh
sails
at
last
her
feeling
of
unrest
got
too
much
for
her
and
she
rose
and
partially
very
partially
dressed
herself
for
in
the
gloom
she
could
only
find
her
flannel
vest
and
petticoat
twisted
her
long
hair
in
a
coil
round
her
head
put
on
a
hat
and
a
thick
ulster
that
hung
upon
the
door
for
they
were
running
into
chilly
latitudes
and
slipped
out
on
deck
it
was
getting
towards
dawn
but
the
night
was
still
dark
looking
up
augusta
could
only
just
make
out
the
outlines
of
the
huge
bellying
sails
for
the
kangaroo
was
rushing
along
before
the
westerly
wind
under
a
full
head
of
steam
and
with
every
inch
of
her
canvas
set
to
ease
the
screw
there
was
something
very
exhilarating
about
the
movement
the
freshness
of
the
night
and
the
wild
sweet
song
of
the
wind
as
it
sang
amongst
the
rigging
augusta
turned
her
face
toward
it
and
being
alone
stretched
out
her
arms
as
though
to
catch
it
the
whole
scene
awoke
some
answering
greatness
in
her
heart
something
that
slumbers
in
the
bosom
of
the
higher
race
of
human
beings
and
only
stirs
and
then
but
faintly
when
the
passions
move
them
or
when
nature
communes
with
her
nobler
children
she
felt
that
at
that
moment
she
could
write
as
she
had
never
written
yet
all
sorts
of
beautiful
ideas
all
sorts
of
aspirations
after
that
noble
calm
and
purity
of
thought
and
life
for
which
we
pray
and
long
but
are
not
allowed
to
reach
came
flowing
into
her
heart
she
almost
thought
that
she
could
hear
her
lost
voice
calling
down
the
gale
and
her
strong
imagination
began
to
paint
her
hovering
like
a
upon
white
wings
high
above
the
taper
point
and
gazing
through
the
darkness
into
the
soul
of
her
she
loved
then
by
those
faint
and
imperceptible
degrees
with
which
thoughts
fade
one
into
another
from
jeannie
her
thought
got
round
to
eustace
meeson
she
wondered
if
he
had
ever
called
at
the
lodgings
at
birmingham
after
she
left
somehow
she
had
an
idea
that
he
was
not
altogether
indifferent
to
her
there
had
been
a
look
in
his
eyes
she
did
not
quite
understand
she
almost
wished
now
she
had
sent
him
a
line
or
a
message
perhaps
she
would
do
so
from
new
zealand
just
then
her
meditations
were
interrupted
by
a
step
and
turning
round
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
captain
why
miss
smithers
he
said
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
making
up
romances
yes
she
answered
laughing
and
with
perfect
truth
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i
could
not
sleep
and
so
i
came
on
deck
and
very
pleasant
it
is
yes
said
the
captain
if
you
want
something
to
put
into
your
stories
you
wo
find
anything
better
than
this
the
kangaroo
is
showing
her
heels
is
she
miss
smithers
that
the
beauty
of
her
she
can
sail
as
well
as
steam
and
when
she
has
a
strong
wind
like
this
abaft
it
would
have
to
be
something
very
quick
that
would
catch
her
i
believe
that
we
have
been
running
over
seventeen
knots
an
hour
ever
since
midnight
i
hope
to
make
kerguelen
island
by
seven
to
correct
my
chronometers
what
is
kerguelen
island
asked
augusta
oh
it
is
a
desert
place
where
nobody
goes
except
now
and
then
a
whaler
to
fill
up
with
water
i
believe
that
the
astronomers
sent
an
expedition
there
a
few
years
ago
to
observe
the
transit
of
venus
but
it
was
a
failure
because
the
weather
was
so
misty
it
is
nearly
always
misty
there
well
i
must
be
off
miss
smithers
good
night
or
rather
good
morning
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
there
was
a
wild
shout
forward
then
came
an
awful
yell
from
a
dozen
voices
for
god
with
a
wild
leap
like
the
leap
of
a
man
suddenly
shot
the
captain
left
her
side
and
rushed
on
to
the
bridge
at
the
same
instant
the
rang
and
the
began
to
rattle
furiously
on
the
rollers
at
her
feet
as
the
steam
did
its
work
then
came
another
yell
a
whaler
no
and
an
answering
shriek
of
terror
from
some
big
black
object
that
loomed
ahead
before
the
echoes
had
died
away
before
the
great
ship
could
even
answer
to
her
helm
there
was
a
crash
such
as
augusta
had
never
heard
and
a
sickening
shock
that
threw
her
on
her
hands
and
knees
on
the
deck
shaking
the
iron
masts
till
they
trembled
as
though
they
were
willow
wands
and
making
the
huge
sails
flap
and
for
an
instant
fly
aback
the
great
vessel
rushing
along
at
her
frightful
speed
of
seventeen
knots
had
plunged
into
the
ship
ahead
with
such
hideous
energy
that
she
cut
her
clean
in
two
cut
her
in
two
and
passed
over
her
as
though
she
were
a
shriek
upon
shriek
of
despair
came
piercing
the
gloomy
night
and
then
as
augusta
struggled
to
her
feet
she
felt
a
horrible
succession
of
bumps
accompanied
by
a
crushing
grinding
noise
it
was
the
kangaroo
driving
right
over
the
remains
of
the
whaler
in
a
very
few
seconds
it
was
done
and
looking
astern
augusta
could
just
make
out
something
black
that
seemed
to
float
for
a
second
or
two
upon
the
water
and
then
disappear
into
its
depths
it
was
the
shattered
hull
of
the
whaler
then
there
arose
a
faint
murmuring
sound
that
grew
first
into
a
hum
then
into
a
roar
and
then
into
a
clamour
that
rent
the
skies
and
up
from
every
hatchway
and
cabin
in
the
great
ship
human
beings
men
women
and
children
came
rushing
and
tumbling
with
faces
white
with
terror
white
as
their
some
were
absolutely
naked
having
slipped
off
their
and
had
no
time
to
put
on
anything
else
some
had
put
on
ulsters
and
others
had
blankets
thrown
round
them
or
carried
their
clothes
in
their
hands
up
they
came
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
them
for
there
were
a
thousand
souls
on
board
the
kangaroo
pouring
aft
like
terrified
spirits
flying
from
the
mouth
of
hell
and
from
them
arose
such
a
hideous
clamour
as
few
have
lived
to
hear
augusta
clung
to
the
nettings
to
let
the
rush
go
by
trying
to
collect
her
scattered
senses
and
to
prevent
herself
from
catching
the
dreadful
contagion
of
the
panic
being
a
brave
and
woman
she
presently
succeeded
and
with
her
returning
clearness
of
vision
she
realized
that
she
and
all
on
board
were
in
great
peril
it
was
clear
that
so
frightful
a
collision
could
not
have
taken
place
without
injury
to
their
own
vessel
nothing
short
of
an
ram
could
have
stood
such
a
shock
probably
they
would
founder
in
a
few
minutes
and
all
be
drowned
in
a
few
minutes
she
might
be
dead
her
heart
stood
still
at
the
horror
of
the
thought
but
once
more
she
recovered
herself
well
after
all
life
had
not
been
pleasant
and
she
had
nothing
to
fear
from
another
world
she
had
done
no
wrong
then
suddenly
she
began
to
think
of
the
others
where
was
lady
holmhurst
and
where
were
the
boy
and
the
nurse
acting
upon
the
impulse
she
did
not
stay
to
realize
she
ran
to
the
saloon
hatchway
it
was
fairly
clear
now
for
most
of
the
people
were
on
deck
and
she
found
her
way
to
the
child
cabin
with
but
little
difficulty
there
was
a
light
in
it
and
the
first
glance
showed
her
that
the
nurse
had
gone
gone
and
deserted
the
child
for
there
he
lay
asleep
with
a
smile
upon
his
little
round
face
the
shock
had
scarcely
wakened
the
boy
and
knowing
nothing
of
he
had
just
shut
his
eyes
and
gone
to
sleep
again
dick
dick
she
said
shaking
him
he
yawned
and
sat
up
and
then
threw
himself
down
again
saying
dick
sleepy
yes
but
dick
must
wake
up
and
auntie
he
called
her
auntie
will
take
him
up
on
deck
to
look
for
mummy
wo
it
be
nice
to
go
on
deck
in
the
dark
yes
said
dick
with
confidence
and
augusta
took
him
on
her
knee
and
hurried
him
into
such
of
his
clothes
as
came
handy
as
quickly
as
she
could
on
the
was
a
warm
little
which
the
child
wore
when
it
was
cold
this
she
put
on
over
his
blouse
and
flannel
shirt
and
then
by
an
took
the
two
blankets
off
his
bunk
and
wrapped
them
round
him
at
the
foot
of
the
nurse
bed
was
a
box
of
biscuits
and
some
milk
the
biscuits
she
emptied
into
the
pockets
of
her
ulster
and
having
given
the
child
as
much
of
the
milk
as
he
would
drink
swallowed
the
rest
herself
then
pinning
a
shawl
which
lay
about
round
her
own
shoulders
she
took
up
the
child
and
made
her
way
with
him
on
to
the
deck
at
the
head
of
the
companion
she
met
lord
holmhurst
himself
rushing
down
to
look
after
the
child
i
have
got
him
lord
holmhurst
she
cried
the
nurse
has
run
away
where
is
your
wife
bless
you
he
said
fervently
you
are
a
good
girl
bessie
is
aft
somewhere
i
would
not
let
her
come
they
are
trying
to
keep
the
people
off
the
boats
they
are
all
mad
are
we
sinking
she
asked
faintly
god
knows
ah
here
is
the
captain
pointing
to
a
man
who
was
walking
or
rather
pushing
his
way
rapidly
towards
them
through
the
maddened
screeching
mob
lord
holmhurst
caught
him
by
the
arm
let
me
go
he
said
roughly
trying
to
shake
himself
loose
oh
it
is
you
lord
holmhurst
yes
step
in
here
for
one
second
and
tell
us
the
worst
speak
up
man
and
let
us
know
all
very
well
lord
holmhurst
i
will
we
have
run
down
a
whaler
of
about
five
hundred
tons
which
was
cruising
along
under
reduced
canvas
and
showing
no
lights
our
fore
compartment
is
stove
right
in
bulging
out
the
plates
on
each
side
of
the
and
loosening
the
fore
bulkhead
the
carpenter
and
his
mates
are
doing
their
best
to
shore
it
up
from
the
inside
with
balks
of
timber
but
the
water
is
coming
in
like
a
mill
race
and
i
fear
there
are
other
injuries
all
the
pumps
are
at
work
but
there
a
deal
of
water
and
if
the
bulkhead
goes
we
shall
go
too
said
lord
holmhurst
calmly
well
we
must
take
to
the
boats
is
that
all
in
heaven
name
is
that
not
enough
said
the
captain
looking
up
so
that
the
light
that
was
fixed
in
the
companion
threw
his
ghastly
face
into
bold
relief
no
lord
holmhurst
it
is
not
all
the
boats
will
hold
something
over
three
hundred
people
there
are
about
one
thousand
souls
aboard
the
kangaroo
of
whom
more
than
three
hundred
are
women
and
children
therefore
the
men
must
drown
said
lord
holmhurst
quietly
will
be
done
your
lordship
will
of
course
take
a
place
in
the
boats
said
the
captain
hurriedly
i
have
ordered
them
to
be
prepared
and
fortunately
day
is
breaking
i
rely
upon
you
to
explain
matters
to
the
owners
if
you
escape
and
clear
my
character
the
boats
must
make
for
kerguelen
land
it
is
about
seventy
miles
to
the
eastward
you
must
give
your
message
to
someone
else
captain
was
the
answer
i
shall
stay
and
share
the
fate
of
the
other
men
there
was
no
pomposity
about
lord
holmhurst
now
all
that
had
gone
and
nothing
but
the
simple
gallant
nature
of
the
english
gentleman
remained
no
no
said
the
captain
as
they
hurried
aft
pushing
their
way
through
the
crowd
have
you
got
your
revolver
yes
well
then
keep
it
handy
you
may
have
to
use
it
presently
they
will
try
and
rush
the
boats
by
this
time
the
grey
dawn
was
slowly
breaking
throwing
a
cold
and
ghastly
light
upon
the
hideous
scene
of
terror
round
about
the
boats
were
gathered
the
officers
and
some
of
the
crew
doing
their
best
to
prepare
them
for
lowering
indeed
one
had
already
been
got
away
in
it
was
lady
holmhurst
who
had
been
thrown
there
against
her
will
shrieking
for
her
child
and
husband
and
about
a
score
of
women
and
children
together
with
sailors
and
an
officer
augusta
caught
sight
of
her
friend
face
in
the
faint
light
bessie
bessie
lady
holmhurst
she
cried
i
have
got
the
boy
it
is
all
right
i
have
got
the
boy
she
heard
her
and
waved
her
hand
wildly
towards
her
and
then
the
men
in
the
boat
gave
way
and
in
a
second
it
was
out
of
earshot
just
then
a
tall
form
seized
augusta
by
the
arm
she
looked
up
it
was
tombey
and
she
saw
that
in
his
other
hand
he
held
a
revolver
thank
god
he
shouted
in
her
ear
i
have
found
you
this
way
this
way
quick
and
he
dragged
her
aft
to
where
two
sailors
standing
by
the
davits
that
supported
a
small
boat
were
lowering
her
to
the
level
of
the
bulwarks
now
then
women
shouted
an
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
the
operation
some
men
made
a
rush
women
first
women
first
i
am
in
no
hurry
said
augusta
stepping
forward
with
the
trembling
child
in
her
arms
and
her
action
for
a
few
seconds
produced
a
calming
effect
for
the
men
stopped
come
on
said
tombey
stooping
to
lift
her
over
the
side
only
to
be
nearly
knocked
down
by
a
man
who
made
a
desperate
effort
to
get
into
the
boat
it
was
meeson
and
recognising
him
tombey
dealt
him
a
blow
that
sent
him
spinning
back
a
thousand
pounds
for
a
place
he
roared
ten
thousand
pounds
for
a
seat
in
a
boat
and
once
more
he
scrambled
up
at
the
bulwarks
trampling
down
a
child
as
he
did
so
and
was
once
more
thrown
back
tombey
took
augusta
and
the
child
into
his
strong
arms
and
put
her
into
the
boat
as
he
did
so
he
kissed
her
forehead
and
murmured
god
bless
you
at
that
instant
there
was
a
loud
report
forward
and
the
stern
of
the
vessel
lifted
perceptibly
the
bulkhead
had
given
way
and
there
arose
such
a
yell
as
surely
was
seldom
heard
before
to
augusta
ears
it
seemed
to
shape
itself
into
the
word
up
from
the
bowels
of
the
ship
poured
the
firemen
the
appearance
of
whose
blackened
faces
lined
with
white
streaks
of
perspiration
added
a
new
impulse
of
terror
to
the
throng
aft
they
came
accompanied
by
a
crowd
of
sailors
and
emigrants
rush
the
boats
sung
out
a
voice
with
a
strong
irish
accent
or
sure
we
be
drowned
taking
the
hint
the
maddened
mob
burst
towards
the
boats
like
a
flood
blaspheming
and
shrieking
as
it
came
in
a
moment
the
women
and
children
who
were
waiting
to
take
to
the
boat
in
which
augusta
and
the
two
were
already
were
swept
aside
and
a
determined
effort
was
made
to
rush
it
headed
by
a
great
irishman
the
same
who
had
called
out
augusta
saw
tombey
lord
holmhurst
who
had
come
up
and
the
officer
lift
their
pistols
which
exploded
almost
simultaneously
and
the
irishman
and
another
man
pitched
forward
on
to
their
hands
and
knees
never
mind
the
pistols
lads
shouted
a
voice
as
well
be
shot
as
drown
there
is
room
for
half
of
us
in
the
boats
come
on
and
a
second
fearful
rush
was
made
which
bore
the
three
gentlemen
firing
as
they
went
right
up
against
the
nettings
bill
halloaed
the
man
who
was
holding
on
to
the
foremost
tackle
lower
away
we
shall
be
rushed
and
swamped
bill
obeyed
with
heart
and
soul
and
down
sank
the
boat
below
the
level
of
the
upper
decks
just
as
the
mob
was
getting
the
mastery
in
five
seconds
more
they
were
hanging
close
over
the
water
and
whilst
they
were
in
this
position
a
man
leapt
at
the
boat
from
the
bulwarks
he
struck
on
the
thwarts
rolled
off
into
the
water
and
was
no
more
seen
a
lady
the
wife
of
a
colonial
judge
threw
her
child
augusta
tried
to
catch
it
but
missed
and
the
boy
sank
and
was
lost
in
another
moment
the
two
sailors
had
shoved
off
from
the
ship
side
as
they
did
so
the
stern
of
the
kangaroo
lifted
right
out
of
the
water
so
that
they
could
see
under
her
just
then
too
with
a
yell
of
terror
meeson
in
whom
the
elementary
principle
of
at
all
costs
was
strongly
developed
cast
himself
from
the
side
and
fell
with
a
splash
within
a
few
feet
of
the
boat
rising
to
the
surface
he
clutched
hold
of
the
gunwale
and
implored
to
be
taken
in
knock
the
old
varmint
over
the
knuckles
bill
shouted
the
other
man
he
upset
us
no
no
cried
augusta
her
woman
heart
moved
at
seeing
her
old
enemy
in
such
a
case
there
is
plenty
of
room
in
the
boat
hold
on
then
said
the
man
addressed
whose
name
was
johnnie
when
we
get
clear
we
haul
you
in
and
the
reader
may
be
sure
meeson
did
hold
on
pretty
tight
till
after
rowing
about
fifty
yards
the
two
men
halted
and
proceeded
not
without
some
risk
and
trouble
for
there
was
a
considerable
sea
running
to
hoist
meeson
large
form
over
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
meanwhile
the
horrors
on
board
the
doomed
ship
were
redoubling
as
she
slowly
settled
to
her
watery
grave
forward
the
steam
was
going
unceasingly
bellowing
like
a
thousand
furious
bulls
while
now
and
again
a
rocket
still
shot
up
through
the
misty
morning
air
round
the
boats
a
hideous
war
was
being
waged
augusta
saw
a
great
number
of
men
jump
into
one
of
the
largest
which
was
still
hanging
to
the
davits
having
evidently
got
the
better
of
those
who
were
attempting
to
fill
it
with
the
women
and
children
the
next
second
they
lowered
the
after
tackle
but
by
some
hitch
or
misunderstanding
not
the
foremost
one
with
the
result
that
the
stern
of
the
boat
fell
while
the
bow
remained
fixed
and
every
soul
in
it
some
forty
or
fifty
people
was
shot
out
into
the
water
another
boat
was
overturned
by
a
sea
as
it
settled
on
the
water
another
one
full
of
women
and
children
got
to
the
water
all
right
but
remained
fastened
to
the
ship
by
the
bow
tackle
when
a
couple
of
minutes
afterwards
the
kangaroo
went
down
nobody
had
a
knife
at
hand
wherewith
to
cut
the
rope
and
the
boat
was
dragged
down
with
her
and
all
its
occupants
drowned
the
remaining
boats
with
the
exception
of
the
one
in
which
lady
holmhurst
was
and
which
had
been
got
away
before
the
rush
began
were
never
lowered
at
all
or
sank
as
soon
as
lowered
it
was
impossible
to
lower
them
owing
to
the
mad
behaviour
of
the
crowds
who
fought
like
wild
beasts
for
a
place
in
them
a
few
gentlemen
and
sailors
could
do
nothing
against
a
mob
of
frantic
creatures
each
bent
on
saving
his
own
life
if
it
cost
the
lives
of
all
else
on
board
and
thus
it
was
exactly
twenty
minutes
from
the
time
that
the
kangaroo
sank
the
whaler
for
although
these
events
have
taken
some
time
to
describe
they
did
not
take
long
to
enact
that
her
own
hour
came
and
with
the
exception
of
some
souls
all
told
the
hour
also
of
every
living
creature
who
had
taken
passage
in
her
chapter
viii
kerguelen
land
as
soon
as
meeson
saved
from
drowning
by
her
intervention
lay
gasping
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
augusta
overcome
by
a
momentary
faintness
let
her
head
fall
forward
on
to
the
bundle
of
blankets
in
which
she
had
wrapped
up
the
child
she
had
rescued
and
who
too
terrified
to
speak
or
cry
stared
about
him
with
and
frightened
eyes
when
she
lifted
it
a
few
seconds
later
a
ray
from
the
rising
sun
had
pierced
the
mist
and
striking
full
on
the
sinking
ship
as
her
stern
well
out
of
the
water
and
her
bow
well
under
it
she
rolled
sullenly
to
and
fro
in
the
trough
of
the
heavy
sea
seemed
to
wrap
her
from
hull
to
truck
in
wild
and
stormy
light
she
going
by
george
she
going
said
the
seaman
johnnie
and
as
he
said
it
the
mighty
ship
slowly
reared
herself
up
on
end
slowly
very
slowly
amidst
the
hideous
and
despairing
shrieks
of
the
doomed
wretches
on
board
of
her
she
lifted
her
stern
higher
and
higher
and
plunged
her
bows
deeper
and
deeper
they
shrieked
they
cried
to
heaven
for
help
but
heaven
heeded
them
not
for
man
agony
can
not
avert
man
doom
now
for
a
space
she
was
standing
almost
upright
upon
the
water
out
of
which
about
a
hundred
feet
of
her
vast
length
towered
like
some
monstrous
ocean
growth
whilst
men
fell
from
her
in
showers
like
flies
benumbed
by
frost
down
into
the
churning
foam
beneath
then
suddenly
with
a
swift
and
awful
rush
with
a
rending
sound
of
breaking
spars
a
loud
explosion
of
her
boilers
and
a
smothered
boom
of
bursting
bulkheads
she
plunged
down
into
the
measureless
deeps
and
was
seen
no
more
forever
the
water
closed
in
over
where
she
had
been
boiling
and
foaming
and
sucking
down
all
things
in
the
wake
of
her
last
journey
while
the
steam
and
prisoned
air
came
up
in
huge
hissing
jets
and
bubbles
that
exploded
into
spray
on
the
surface
the
men
groaned
the
child
stared
stupified
and
augusta
cried
out
like
one
in
pain
row
back
she
gasped
row
back
and
see
if
we
can
not
pick
some
of
them
up
no
no
shouted
meeson
they
will
sink
the
boat
much
use
anyway
said
johnnie
i
doubt
that
precious
few
of
them
will
come
up
again
they
have
gone
too
deep
however
they
got
the
boat
head
round
again
slowly
enough
augusta
thought
and
as
they
did
so
they
heard
a
feeble
cry
or
two
but
by
the
time
that
they
had
reached
the
spot
where
the
kangaroo
went
down
there
was
no
living
creature
to
be
seen
nothing
but
the
wash
of
the
great
waves
over
which
the
mist
once
more
closed
thick
and
heavy
as
a
pall
they
shouted
and
once
they
heard
a
faint
answer
and
rowed
towards
it
but
when
they
got
to
the
spot
whence
the
sound
seemed
to
proceed
they
could
see
nothing
except
some
wreckage
they
were
all
dead
their
agony
was
done
their
cries
no
more
ascended
to
the
pitiless
heavens
and
wind
and
sky
and
sea
were
just
as
they
had
been
oh
my
god
my
god
wept
augusta
clinging
to
the
thwarts
of
the
tossing
boat
one
boat
got
away
where
is
it
asked
meeson
who
a
wet
and
wretched
figure
was
huddled
up
in
the
as
he
rolled
his
wild
eyes
round
striving
to
pierce
the
curtain
of
the
mist
there
something
said
johnnie
pointing
through
a
in
the
mist
that
seemed
to
grow
denser
rather
than
otherwise
as
the
light
increased
at
a
round
object
that
had
suddenly
appeared
to
the
starboard
of
them
they
rowed
up
to
it
it
was
a
boat
but
empty
and
floating
bottom
upwards
closer
examination
showed
that
it
was
the
cutter
which
when
full
of
women
and
children
had
been
fastened
to
the
vessel
and
dragged
down
with
her
as
she
sank
at
a
certain
depth
the
pressure
of
the
water
had
been
too
great
and
had
torn
the
ring
in
the
bow
bodily
out
of
her
so
that
she
returned
to
the
surface
but
those
in
her
did
not
return
at
least
not
yet
once
more
two
or
three
days
hence
they
would
arise
from
the
watery
depths
and
look
upon
the
skies
with
eyes
that
could
not
see
and
then
vanish
for
ever
turning
from
this
awful
and
most
moving
sight
they
rowed
slowly
through
quantities
of
floating
wreckage
barrels
hencoops
in
one
of
these
they
found
two
drowned
fowls
which
they
secured
and
many
other
articles
such
as
oars
and
wicker
and
began
to
shout
vigorously
in
the
hope
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
survivors
in
the
other
boat
which
they
imagined
could
not
be
far
off
their
efforts
however
proved
fruitless
owing
to
the
thickness
of
the
fog
and
in
the
considerable
sea
which
was
running
it
was
impossible
to
see
more
than
twenty
yards
or
so
also
what
between
the
wind
and
the
wash
and
turmoil
of
the
water
the
sound
of
their
voices
did
not
travel
far
the
ocean
is
a
large
place
and
a
is
easily
lost
sight
of
upon
its
furrowed
surface
therefore
it
is
not
wonderful
that
although
the
two
boats
were
at
the
moment
within
half
a
mile
of
each
other
they
never
met
and
each
took
its
separate
course
in
the
hope
of
escaping
the
fate
of
the
vessel
the
boat
in
which
were
lady
holmhurst
and
some
twenty
other
passengers
together
with
the
second
officer
and
a
crew
of
six
men
after
seeing
the
kangaroo
sink
and
picking
up
one
survivor
shaped
a
course
for
kerguelen
land
believing
that
they
and
they
alone
remained
to
tell
the
tale
of
that
awful
shipwreck
and
here
it
may
be
convenient
to
state
that
before
nightfall
they
were
picked
up
by
a
that
sailed
with
them
to
albany
on
the
coast
of
australia
thence
an
account
of
the
disaster
which
as
the
reader
will
remember
created
a
deep
impression
was
telegraphed
home
and
thence
in
due
course
the
widowed
lady
holmhurst
and
most
of
the
other
women
who
escaped
were
taken
back
to
england
to
return
to
our
heroine
and
meeson
the
occupants
of
the
little
boat
sat
looking
at
each
other
with
white
scared
faces
till
at
last
the
man
called
johnnie
who
was
not
a
tar
of
a
very
amiable
cast
of
countenance
possibly
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
nose
was
knocked
almost
flat
against
the
side
of
his
face
swore
violently
and
said
it
was
no
good
stopping
there
all
the
etceteraed
day
thereupon
bill
who
was
a
more
man
remarked
that
he
johnnie
was
etceteraed
well
right
so
they
had
better
hoist
the
at
this
point
augusta
interposed
and
told
them
that
the
captain
just
as
the
vessel
came
into
collision
had
informed
her
that
he
was
making
kerguelen
land
which
was
not
more
than
sixty
or
seventy
miles
away
they
had
a
compass
in
the
boat
and
they
knew
the
course
the
kangaroo
was
steering
when
she
sank
accordingly
without
wasting
further
time
they
got
as
much
sail
up
as
the
little
boat
could
carry
in
the
stiff
breeze
and
ran
nearly
due
east
before
the
steady
westerly
wind
all
day
long
they
ran
across
the
misty
ocean
the
little
boat
behaving
splendidly
without
sighting
any
living
thing
till
at
last
the
night
closed
in
again
there
was
fortunately
a
bag
of
biscuits
in
the
boat
and
a
breaker
of
water
also
there
was
unfortunately
a
breaker
of
rum
from
which
the
two
sailors
bill
and
johnnie
were
already
taking
quite
as
much
as
was
good
for
them
consequently
though
they
were
cold
and
wet
with
the
spray
they
had
not
to
face
the
added
horrors
of
starvation
and
thirst
at
sundown
they
shortened
sail
considerably
only
leaving
enough
canvas
up
to
keep
the
boat
ahead
of
the
sea
somehow
the
long
night
wore
away
augusta
scarcely
closed
her
eyes
but
little
dick
slept
like
a
top
upon
her
bosom
sheltered
by
her
arms
and
the
blanket
from
the
cold
and
penetrating
spray
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
lay
meeson
to
whom
augusta
pitying
his
condition
for
he
was
shivering
dreadfully
had
given
the
other
blanket
keeping
nothing
for
herself
except
the
woollen
shawl
at
last
however
there
came
a
faint
glow
in
the
east
and
the
daylight
began
to
break
over
the
stormy
sea
augusta
turned
her
head
and
stared
through
the
mist
what
is
that
she
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
excitement
to
the
sailor
bill
who
was
taking
his
turn
at
the
tiller
and
she
pointed
to
a
dark
mass
that
loomed
up
almost
over
them
the
man
looked
and
then
looked
again
and
then
hallowed
out
joyfully
land
land
ahead
up
struggled
meeson
on
to
his
knees
his
legs
were
so
stiff
that
he
could
not
stand
and
began
to
stare
wildly
about
him
thank
god
he
cried
where
is
it
is
it
new
zealand
if
ever
i
get
there
i
stop
there
i
never
get
on
a
ship
again
new
zealand
growled
the
sailor
are
you
a
fool
it
kerguelen
land
that
what
it
is
where
it
rains
all
day
and
nobody
lives
not
even
a
nigger
it
like
enough
that
you
stop
there
though
for
i
reckon
that
anybody
will
come
to
take
you
off
in
a
hurry
meeson
collapsed
with
a
groan
and
a
few
minutes
afterwards
the
sun
rose
while
the
mist
grew
less
and
less
till
at
last
it
almost
disappeared
revealing
a
grand
panorama
to
the
occupants
of
the
boat
for
before
them
was
line
upon
line
of
jagged
and
lofty
peaks
stretching
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
gradually
melting
in
the
distance
into
the
cold
white
gleam
of
snow
bill
slightly
altered
the
boat
course
to
the
southward
and
sailing
round
a
point
she
came
into
comparatively
calm
water
then
due
north
of
them
running
into
the
land
they
saw
the
mouth
of
a
great
fjord
bounded
on
each
side
by
towering
mountain
banks
so
steep
as
to
be
almost
precipitous
around
whose
lofty
sides
thousands
of
sea
fowl
wheeled
awaking
the
echoes
with
their
clamour
right
into
this
beautiful
fjord
they
sailed
past
a
line
of
flat
rocks
on
which
sat
huge
fantastic
monsters
that
the
sailors
said
were
along
the
line
of
beetling
cliff
till
they
came
to
a
spot
where
the
shore
on
which
grew
a
rank
grass
shelved
gently
up
from
the
edge
to
the
frowning
and
precipitous
background
and
here
to
their
huge
delight
they
discovered
two
huts
roughly
built
of
old
ship
timbers
placed
within
a
score
of
yards
of
each
other
and
a
distance
of
some
fifty
paces
from
the
water
edge
well
there
a
house
anyway
said
the
johnnie
though
it
do
look
as
though
it
had
paid
rates
and
taxes
lately
let
us
land
and
get
out
of
this
horrible
boat
said
meeson
feebly
a
proposition
that
augusta
seconded
heartily
enough
accordingly
the
sail
was
lowered
and
getting
out
the
oars
the
two
sailors
rowed
the
boat
into
a
little
natural
harbour
that
opened
out
of
the
main
creek
and
in
ten
minutes
her
occupants
were
once
more
stretching
their
legs
upon
dry
land
that
is
if
any
land
in
kerguelen
island
that
region
of
perpetual
wet
could
be
said
to
be
dry
their
first
care
was
to
go
up
to
the
huts
and
examine
them
with
a
result
that
could
scarcely
be
called
encouraging
the
huts
had
been
built
some
years
whether
by
the
expedition
which
in
came
thither
to
observe
the
transit
of
venus
or
by
former
parties
of
shipwrecked
mariners
they
never
discovered
and
were
now
in
a
state
of
ruin
mosses
and
lichens
grew
plentifully
upon
the
beams
and
even
on
the
floor
while
great
holes
in
the
roof
let
in
the
wet
which
lay
in
little
slimy
puddles
beneath
still
with
all
their
drawbacks
they
were
decidedly
better
than
the
open
beach
a
very
short
experience
of
which
in
that
inclement
climate
would
certainly
have
killed
them
and
they
thankfully
decided
to
make
the
best
of
them
accordingly
the
smaller
of
the
two
huts
was
given
up
to
augusta
and
the
boy
dick
while
meeson
and
the
sailors
took
possession
of
the
large
one
their
next
task
was
to
move
up
their
scanty
belongings
the
boat
having
first
been
carefully
beached
and
to
clean
out
the
huts
and
make
them
as
habitable
as
possible
by
stretching
the
sails
of
the
boat
on
the
damp
floors
and
covering
up
the
holes
in
the
roof
as
best
they
could
with
stones
and
bits
of
board
from
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
weather
was
fortunately
dry
and
as
they
all
with
the
exception
of
meeson
who
seemed
to
be
quite
prostrated
worked
with
a
will
not
excepting
master
dick
who
toddled
backwards
and
forwards
after
augusta
in
high
glee
at
finding
himself
on
terra
firma
and
by
midday
everything
that
could
be
done
was
done
then
they
made
a
fire
of
some
for
fortunately
they
had
a
few
matches
and
augusta
cooked
the
two
fowls
they
had
got
out
of
the
floating
as
well
as
circumstances
would
allow
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
not
very
well
and
they
had
dinner
of
which
they
all
stood
sadly
in
need
after
dinner
they
reckoned
up
their
resources
of
water
there
was
an
ample
supply
for
not
far
from
the
huts
a
stream
ran
down
into
the
fjord
for
food
they
had
the
best
part
of
a
bag
of
biscuits
weighing
about
a
hundred
pounds
also
there
was
the
cask
of
rum
which
the
men
had
moved
into
their
own
hut
but
that
was
not
all
for
there
were
plenty
of
shellfish
about
if
they
could
find
means
to
cook
them
while
the
rocks
around
were
covered
with
hundreds
of
penguins
including
specimens
of
the
great
king
penguin
which
only
required
to
be
knocked
on
the
head
there
was
therefore
little
fear
of
their
perishing
of
starvation
as
sometimes
happens
to
ship
wrecked
people
indeed
immediately
after
dinner
the
two
sailors
went
out
and
returned
with
as
many
eggs
mostly
penguin
as
they
could
carry
in
their
hats
scarcely
had
they
got
in
however
when
the
rain
which
is
the
prevailing
characteristic
of
these
latitudes
set
in
in
the
most
pitiless
fashion
and
soon
the
great
mountains
with
which
they
were
surrounded
and
those
before
them
were
wrapped
in
dense
veils
of
fleecy
vapour
hour
after
hour
the
rain
fell
without
ceasing
penetrating
through
their
miserable
roof
and
falling
drop
drip
drop
upon
the
sodden
floor
augusta
sat
by
herself
in
the
smaller
hut
doing
what
she
could
to
amuse
little
dick
by
telling
him
stories
nobody
knows
how
hard
she
found
it
to
have
to
invent
stories
when
she
was
thus
overwhelmed
with
misfortune
but
it
was
the
only
way
of
keeping
the
poor
child
from
crying
as
the
sense
of
cold
and
misery
forced
itself
into
his
little
heart
so
she
told
him
about
robinson
crusoe
and
then
she
told
him
that
they
were
playing
at
being
robinson
crusoe
to
which
the
child
very
sensibly
replied
that
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
game
and
wanted
his
mamma
and
meanwhile
it
grew
darker
and
colder
and
damper
hour
by
hour
till
at
last
the
light
went
out
and
left
her
with
nothing
to
keep
her
company
but
the
moaning
wind
the
falling
rain
and
the
wild
cries
of
the
when
something
disturbed
them
from
their
rest
the
child
was
asleep
at
last
wrapped
up
in
a
blanket
and
one
of
the
smaller
sails
and
augusta
feeling
quite
worn
out
with
solitude
and
the
pressure
of
heavy
thoughts
began
to
think
that
the
best
thing
she
could
do
would
be
to
try
to
follow
his
example
when
suddenly
there
came
a
knock
at
the
boards
which
served
for
a
door
to
the
shanty
who
is
it
she
cried
with
a
start
me
meeson
answered
a
voice
can
i
come
in
yes
if
you
like
said
augusta
sharply
though
in
her
heart
she
was
really
glad
to
see
him
or
rather
to
hear
him
for
it
was
too
dark
to
see
anything
it
is
wonderful
how
under
the
pressure
of
a
great
calamity
we
forget
our
quarrels
and
our
spites
and
are
ready
to
jump
at
the
prospect
of
the
human
companionship
of
our
deadliest
enemy
and
the
moral
of
that
is
as
the
white
queen
says
that
as
we
are
all
night
and
day
face
to
face
with
the
last
dread
calamity
death
we
should
throughout
our
lives
behave
as
though
we
saw
the
present
shadow
of
his
hand
but
that
will
never
happen
in
the
world
while
human
nature
is
human
nature
and
when
will
it
become
anything
else
put
up
the
door
again
said
augusta
when
from
a
rather
rawer
rush
of
air
than
usual
she
gathered
that
her
visitor
was
within
the
hut
meeson
obeyed
groaning
audibly
those
two
brutes
are
getting
drunk
he
said
swallowing
down
rum
by
the
gallon
i
have
come
because
i
could
not
stop
with
them
any
longer
and
i
am
so
ill
miss
smithers
so
ill
i
believe
that
i
am
going
to
die
sometimes
i
feel
as
though
all
the
marrow
in
my
bones
were
ice
and
and
at
others
just
as
though
somebody
were
shoving
a
wire
up
them
ca
you
do
anything
for
me
i
do
see
what
is
to
be
done
answered
augusta
gently
for
the
man
misery
touched
her
in
spite
of
her
dislike
for
him
you
had
better
lie
down
and
try
to
go
to
sleep
to
sleep
he
moaned
how
can
i
sleep
my
blanket
is
wringing
wet
and
my
clothes
are
damp
and
he
fairly
broke
down
and
began
to
groan
and
sob
try
and
go
to
sleep
urged
augusta
again
he
made
no
answer
but
by
degrees
he
grew
quieter
overwhelmed
perhaps
by
the
solemn
presence
of
the
darkness
augusta
laid
her
head
against
the
and
at
last
sank
into
blissful
oblivion
for
to
the
young
sleep
is
a
constant
friend
once
or
twice
she
woke
but
only
to
drop
off
again
and
when
she
finally
opened
her
eyes
it
was
quite
light
and
the
rain
had
ceased
her
first
care
was
for
little
dick
who
had
slept
soundly
throughout
the
night
and
appeared
to
be
none
the
worse
she
took
him
outside
the
hut
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
in
the
stream
and
then
sat
him
down
to
a
breakfast
of
biscuit
as
she
returned
she
met
the
two
sailors
who
although
they
were
now
fairly
sober
bore
upon
their
faces
the
marks
of
a
fearful
debauch
evidently
they
had
been
drinking
heavily
she
drew
herself
up
and
looked
at
them
and
they
slunk
past
her
in
silence
then
she
returned
to
the
hut
meeson
was
sitting
up
when
she
entered
and
the
bright
light
from
the
open
door
fell
full
upon
his
face
his
appearance
fairly
shocked
her
the
heavy
cheeks
had
fallen
in
there
were
great
purple
rings
round
his
hollow
eyes
and
his
whole
aspect
was
one
of
a
man
in
the
last
stage
of
illness
i
have
had
such
a
night
he
said
oh
heaven
such
a
night
i
believe
that
i
shall
live
through
another
nonsense
said
augusta
eat
some
biscuit
and
you
will
feel
better
he
took
a
piece
of
the
biscuit
which
she
gave
him
and
attempted
to
swallow
it
but
could
not
it
is
no
use
he
said
i
am
a
dying
man
sitting
in
those
wet
clothes
in
the
boat
has
finished
me
and
augusta
looking
at
his
face
could
not
but
believe
him
chapter
ix
augusta
to
the
rescue
after
breakfast
that
is
after
augusta
had
eaten
some
biscuit
and
a
wing
that
remained
from
the
chickens
she
had
managed
to
cook
upon
the
previous
day
bill
and
johnnie
the
two
sailors
set
to
work
at
her
suggestion
to
fix
up
a
long
fragment
of
on
a
point
of
rock
and
to
bind
it
on
to
a
flag
that
they
happened
to
find
in
the
locker
of
the
boat
there
was
not
much
chance
of
its
being
seen
by
anybody
in
that
atmosphere
even
if
anybody
came
there
to
see
it
of
which
there
was
still
less
chance
still
they
did
it
as
a
sort
of
duty
by
the
time
this
task
was
finished
it
was
midday
and
for
a
wonder
there
was
little
wind
and
the
sun
shone
out
brightly
on
returning
to
the
huts
augusta
got
the
blankets
out
to
dry
and
set
the
two
sailors
to
roast
some
of
the
eggs
they
had
found
on
the
previous
day
this
they
did
willingly
enough
for
they
were
now
quite
sober
and
very
much
ashamed
of
themselves
then
after
giving
dick
some
more
biscuit
and
four
roasted
eggs
which
he
took
to
wonderfully
she
went
to
meeson
who
was
lying
groaning
in
the
hut
and
persuaded
him
to
come
and
sit
out
in
the
warmth
by
this
time
the
wretched
man
condition
was
pitiable
for
though
his
strength
was
still
whole
in
him
he
was
persuaded
that
he
was
going
to
die
and
could
touch
nothing
but
some
miss
smithers
he
said
as
he
sat
shivering
upon
the
rocks
i
am
going
to
die
in
this
horrible
place
and
i
am
not
fit
to
die
to
think
of
me
he
went
on
with
a
sudden
burst
of
his
old
fire
to
think
of
me
dying
like
a
starved
dog
in
the
cold
when
i
have
two
millions
of
money
waiting
to
be
spent
there
in
england
and
i
would
give
them
all
yes
every
farthing
of
them
to
find
myself
safe
at
home
again
by
jove
i
would
change
places
with
any
poor
devil
of
a
writer
in
the
hutches
yes
i
would
turn
author
on
twenty
pounds
a
month
that
will
give
you
some
idea
of
my
condition
miss
smithers
to
think
that
i
should
ever
live
to
say
that
i
would
care
to
be
a
beggarly
author
who
could
not
make
a
thousand
a
year
if
he
wrote
till
his
fingers
fell
off
oh
oh
and
he
fairly
sobbed
at
the
horror
and
degradation
of
the
thought
augusta
looked
at
the
poor
wretch
and
then
bethought
her
of
the
proud
creature
she
had
known
raging
terribly
through
the
obsequious
ranks
of
clerks
and
carrying
desolation
to
the
hutches
and
the
editorial
department
she
looked
and
was
filled
with
reflections
on
the
mutability
of
human
affairs
alas
how
changed
that
meeson
yes
he
went
on
recovering
himself
a
little
i
am
going
to
die
in
this
horrible
place
and
all
my
money
will
not
even
give
me
a
decent
funeral
addison
and
roscoe
will
get
it
confound
them
as
though
they
had
not
got
enough
already
it
makes
me
mad
when
i
think
of
those
addison
girls
spending
my
money
or
bribing
peers
to
marry
them
with
it
or
something
of
that
sort
i
disinherited
my
own
nephew
eustace
and
kicked
him
out
to
sink
or
swim
and
now
i
ca
undo
it
and
i
would
give
anything
to
alter
it
we
quarrelled
about
you
miss
smithers
because
i
would
not
give
you
any
more
money
for
that
book
of
yours
i
wish
i
had
given
it
to
you
anything
you
wanted
i
did
treat
you
well
but
miss
smithers
a
bargain
is
a
bargain
it
would
never
have
done
to
give
way
on
principle
you
must
understand
that
miss
smithers
do
revenge
yourself
on
me
about
it
now
that
i
am
helpless
because
you
see
it
was
a
matter
of
principle
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
revenging
myself
meeson
answered
augusta
with
dignity
but
i
think
that
you
have
done
a
very
wicked
thing
to
disinherit
your
nephew
in
that
fashion
and
i
do
wonder
that
you
feel
uncomfortable
about
it
the
expression
of
this
vigorous
opinion
served
to
disturb
conscience
all
the
more
and
he
burst
out
into
laments
and
regrets
well
said
augusta
at
last
if
you
do
like
your
will
you
had
better
alter
it
there
are
enough
of
us
here
to
witness
a
will
and
if
anything
happens
to
you
it
will
override
the
other
will
it
not
this
was
a
new
idea
and
the
dying
man
jumped
at
it
of
course
of
course
he
said
i
never
thought
of
that
before
i
will
do
it
at
once
and
cut
addison
and
roscoe
out
altogether
eustace
shall
have
every
farthing
i
never
thought
of
that
before
come
give
me
your
hand
i
get
up
and
see
about
it
stop
a
minute
said
augusta
how
are
you
going
to
write
a
will
without
pen
or
pencil
or
paper
or
ink
meeson
sank
back
with
a
groan
this
difficulty
had
not
occurred
to
him
are
you
sure
nobody
has
got
a
pencil
and
a
bit
of
paper
he
asked
it
would
do
so
long
as
the
writing
remained
legible
i
do
think
so
said
augusta
but
i
will
inquire
accordingly
she
went
and
asked
bill
and
johnnie
but
neither
of
them
had
a
pencil
or
a
single
scrap
of
paper
and
she
returned
sadly
to
communicate
the
news
i
have
got
it
i
have
got
it
said
meeson
as
she
approached
the
spot
where
he
lay
upon
the
rock
if
there
is
no
paper
or
pen
we
must
write
it
in
blood
upon
some
linen
we
can
make
a
pen
from
the
feathers
of
a
bird
i
read
somewhere
in
a
book
of
somebody
who
did
that
it
will
do
as
well
as
anything
else
here
was
an
idea
indeed
and
one
that
augusta
jumped
at
but
in
another
moment
her
enthusiasm
received
a
check
where
was
there
any
linen
to
write
on
yes
she
said
if
you
can
find
some
linen
you
have
got
on
a
flannel
shirt
so
have
the
two
sailors
and
little
dick
is
dressed
in
flannel
too
it
was
a
fact
as
it
happened
not
one
of
the
party
had
a
scrap
of
linen
on
them
or
anything
that
would
answer
the
purpose
indeed
they
had
only
one
between
them
and
it
was
a
red
rag
full
of
holes
augusta
had
had
one
but
it
had
blown
overboard
when
they
were
in
the
boat
what
would
they
not
have
given
for
that
now
yes
said
meeson
it
seems
we
have
none
i
have
even
get
a
or
i
might
have
written
in
blood
upon
that
though
i
have
got
a
hundred
sovereigns
in
gold
i
grabbed
them
up
before
i
bolted
from
the
cabin
but
i
say
excuse
me
miss
smithers
but
um
ah
oh
hang
modesty
have
you
got
some
linen
on
somewhere
or
other
that
you
could
spare
a
bit
of
you
sha
lose
by
giving
it
to
me
there
i
promise
that
i
will
tear
up
the
agreement
if
ever
i
get
out
of
this
which
i
sha
which
i
sha
and
i
will
write
on
the
linen
that
it
is
to
be
torn
up
yes
and
that
you
are
to
have
five
thousand
pounds
legacy
too
miss
smithers
surely
you
can
spare
me
a
little
bit
just
off
the
skirt
or
somewhere
you
know
miss
smithers
it
never
will
be
missed
and
it
is
so
important
augusta
blushed
and
no
wonder
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
nothing
of
the
sort
about
me
meeson
nothing
except
flannel
she
said
i
got
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
before
the
collision
and
there
was
no
light
in
the
cabin
and
i
put
on
whatever
came
first
meaning
to
come
back
and
dress
afterwards
when
it
got
light
stays
said
meeson
desperately
forgive
me
for
mentioning
them
but
surely
you
put
on
your
stays
one
could
write
on
them
you
know
i
am
very
sorry
meeson
she
answered
but
i
did
not
put
any
on
not
a
cuff
or
a
collar
he
said
catching
at
a
last
straw
of
hope
augusta
shook
her
head
sadly
then
there
is
an
end
of
it
groaned
meeson
eustace
must
lose
the
money
poor
lad
poor
lad
i
have
behaved
very
badly
to
him
augusta
stood
still
racking
her
brain
for
some
expedient
for
she
was
determined
that
eustace
meeson
should
not
lose
the
chance
of
that
colossal
fortune
if
she
could
help
it
it
was
but
a
poor
chance
at
the
best
for
meeson
might
not
be
dying
after
all
and
if
he
did
die
it
was
probable
that
his
fate
would
be
their
fate
also
and
no
record
would
remain
of
them
or
of
meeson
testamentary
wishes
as
things
looked
at
present
there
was
every
prospect
of
their
all
perishing
miserably
on
that
desolate
shore
just
then
the
sailor
bill
who
had
been
up
to
the
flagstaff
on
the
rock
on
the
chance
of
catching
sight
of
some
passing
vessel
came
walking
past
his
flannel
were
rolled
up
to
the
elbows
of
his
brawny
arms
and
as
he
stopped
to
speak
to
augusta
she
noticed
something
that
made
her
start
and
gave
her
an
idea
there
ai
nothing
to
be
seen
said
the
man
roughly
and
it
is
my
belief
that
there
wo
be
neither
here
we
are
and
here
we
stops
till
we
dies
and
rots
ah
i
hope
not
said
augusta
bill
will
you
let
me
look
at
the
tattoo
on
your
arm
certainly
miss
said
bill
with
alacrity
holding
his
great
arm
within
an
inch
of
her
nose
it
was
covered
with
various
tattoos
flags
ships
and
what
not
in
the
middle
of
which
written
in
small
letters
along
the
side
of
the
forearm
was
the
sailor
name
bill
jones
who
did
it
mr
bill
asked
augusta
who
did
it
why
i
did
it
myself
a
chap
made
me
a
bet
that
i
could
not
tattoo
my
own
name
on
my
own
arm
so
i
showed
him
and
a
poor
sort
of
hand
i
should
have
been
at
tattooing
if
i
could
not
augusta
said
no
more
till
bill
had
gone
on
then
she
spoke
now
meeson
do
you
see
how
you
can
make
your
will
she
said
quietly
see
no
he
answered
i
do
well
i
do
you
can
tattoo
it
or
rather
get
the
sailor
to
tattoo
it
it
need
not
be
very
long
tattoo
it
what
on
and
what
with
he
asked
astonished
you
can
have
it
tattooed
on
the
back
of
the
other
sailor
johnnie
if
he
will
allow
you
and
as
for
material
you
have
some
revolver
cartridges
if
the
gunpowder
is
mixed
with
water
it
would
do
i
should
think
my
word
said
meeson
you
are
a
wonderful
woman
whoever
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
except
a
woman
go
and
ask
the
man
johnnie
there
a
good
girl
if
he
would
mind
my
will
being
tattooed
upon
his
back
well
said
augusta
it
a
queer
sort
of
message
but
i
try
accordingly
taking
little
dick
by
the
hand
she
went
across
to
where
the
two
sailors
were
sitting
outside
their
hut
and
putting
on
her
sweetest
smile
first
of
all
asked
bill
if
he
would
mind
doing
a
little
tattooing
for
her
to
this
bill
finding
time
hang
heavy
upon
his
hands
and
wishing
to
be
kept
out
of
the
temptation
of
the
graciously
assented
saying
that
he
had
seen
some
sharp
lying
about
which
would
be
the
very
thing
though
he
shook
his
head
at
the
idea
of
using
gunpowder
as
the
medium
he
said
it
would
not
do
at
all
well
and
then
as
though
suddenly
seized
by
an
inspiration
started
off
down
to
the
shore
then
augusta
as
gently
and
nicely
as
she
could
approached
the
question
with
johnnie
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
against
the
hut
his
battered
countenance
wearing
a
peculiarly
expression
probably
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
was
suffering
from
severe
pain
in
his
head
as
a
result
of
the
debauch
of
the
previous
night
slowly
and
with
great
difficulty
for
his
understanding
was
none
of
the
clearest
she
explained
to
him
what
was
required
and
that
it
was
suggested
that
he
should
provide
the
necessary
upon
which
it
was
proposed
that
the
experiment
should
be
made
when
at
last
he
understood
what
it
was
asked
that
he
should
do
johnnie
countenance
was
a
sight
to
see
and
his
language
was
more
striking
than
correct
the
upshot
of
it
was
however
that
he
would
see
meeson
collectively
and
meeson
various
members
separately
especially
his
eyes
somewhere
first
augusta
retreated
till
his
wrath
had
spent
itself
and
then
once
more
returned
to
the
charge
she
was
sure
she
said
that
johnnie
would
not
mind
witnessing
the
document
if
anybody
else
could
be
found
to
submit
to
the
pain
of
the
tattooing
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
for
him
to
touch
the
hand
of
the
operator
while
his
johnnie
name
was
tattooed
as
witness
to
the
will
well
he
said
i
do
know
how
as
i
mind
doing
that
since
you
as
asked
me
miss
and
not
the
d
d
old
hulks
of
a
meeson
i
would
not
lift
a
finger
to
save
him
from
miss
and
that
a
fact
then
that
is
a
promise
mr
johnnie
said
augusta
sweetly
ignoring
the
garnishing
with
which
the
promise
was
adorned
and
on
johnnie
stating
that
he
looked
at
it
in
that
light
she
returned
to
meeson
on
her
way
she
met
bill
carrying
in
his
hands
a
fish
with
long
feelers
and
a
head
like
a
parrot
in
short
a
now
here
luck
miss
said
bill
exultingly
i
saw
this
gentleman
lying
down
on
the
beach
there
this
morning
he
a
cuttle
that
what
he
is
and
i
have
his
out
of
him
in
a
brace
of
shakes
just
the
ticket
for
tattooing
miss
as
good
as
the
best
gunpowder
is
a
fool
to
it
by
this
time
they
had
reached
meeson
and
here
the
whole
matter
including
johnnie
obstinate
refusal
to
be
tattooed
was
explained
to
bill
well
said
augusta
at
length
it
seems
that
the
only
thing
to
be
done
but
the
question
is
how
to
do
it
i
can
only
suggest
meeson
that
the
will
should
be
tattooed
on
you
oh
said
meeson
feebly
on
me
me
tattooed
like
a
savage
tattooed
with
my
own
will
it
would
be
much
use
either
governor
begging
your
pardon
said
bill
that
is
if
you
are
agoing
to
croak
as
you
say
where
would
the
will
be
then
we
might
skin
you
with
a
sharp
stone
perhaps
after
you
done
the
trick
you
know
he
added
reflectively
but
then
we
have
no
salt
so
i
doubt
if
you
keep
and
if
we
set
your
hide
in
the
sun
i
reckon
the
writing
would
shrivel
up
so
that
all
the
courts
of
law
in
london
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
it
meeson
groaned
loudly
as
well
he
might
these
frank
remarks
would
have
been
trying
to
any
man
much
more
were
they
so
to
this
opulent
merchant
prince
who
had
always
set
the
highest
value
on
what
bill
rudely
called
his
hide
there
the
infant
went
on
bill
meditatively
he
young
and
white
and
i
fancy
his
would
work
wonderful
easy
but
you
have
to
hold
him
for
i
expect
that
he
yell
proper
yes
said
meeson
let
the
will
be
tattooed
upon
the
child
he
be
some
use
that
way
yes
said
bill
and
there
allus
be
something
left
to
remind
me
of
a
very
queer
time
provided
he
lives
to
get
out
of
it
which
is
doubtful
wo
rub
out
i
warrant
i
wo
have
dick
touched
said
augusta
indignantly
it
would
frighten
the
child
into
fits
and
besides
nobody
has
a
right
to
mark
him
for
life
in
that
way
well
then
there
about
an
end
of
the
question
said
bill
and
this
gentleman
money
must
go
wherever
it
is
he
do
want
it
to
no
said
augusta
with
a
sudden
flush
there
is
not
eustace
meeson
was
once
very
kind
to
me
and
rather
than
he
should
lose
the
chance
of
getting
what
he
ought
to
have
i
i
will
be
tattooed
well
bust
me
said
bill
with
enthusiasm
bust
me
if
you
ai
a
one
for
a
female
woman
and
if
i
was
that
there
young
man
i
should
make
bold
to
tell
you
so
yes
said
meeson
that
is
an
excellent
idea
you
are
young
and
strong
and
as
there
is
lots
of
food
here
i
dare
say
that
you
will
take
a
long
time
to
die
you
might
even
live
for
some
months
let
us
begin
at
once
i
feel
dreadfully
weak
i
do
think
that
i
can
live
through
the
night
and
if
i
know
that
i
have
done
all
i
can
to
make
sure
that
eustace
gets
his
own
perhaps
dying
will
be
a
little
easier
chapter
x
the
last
of
meeson
augusta
turned
from
the
old
man
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
not
unmixed
with
disgust
his
selfishness
was
of
an
order
that
revolted
her
i
suppose
she
said
sharply
to
bill
that
i
must
have
this
will
tattooed
upon
my
shoulders
yes
miss
that
it
said
bill
you
see
miss
one
wants
space
for
a
doccymint
if
it
were
a
ship
or
a
flag
now
or
a
fancy
pictur
of
your
young
man
i
might
manage
it
on
your
arm
but
there
must
be
breadth
for
a
legal
doccymint
more
especially
as
i
should
like
to
make
a
good
job
of
it
while
i
is
about
it
i
do
want
none
of
them
laryers
up
their
noses
at
bill
jones
tattooing
very
well
said
augusta
with
an
inward
sinking
of
the
heart
i
will
go
and
get
ready
accordingly
she
adjourned
into
the
hut
and
removed
the
body
of
her
dress
and
turned
down
the
flannel
garment
underneath
it
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
leave
as
much
of
her
neck
bare
as
is
to
be
seen
when
a
lady
has
on
a
moderately
low
dress
then
she
came
out
again
dressed
or
rather
undressed
for
the
sacrifice
meanwhile
bill
had
drawn
out
the
of
the
cuttle
had
prepared
a
little
round
fragment
of
wood
which
he
sharpened
like
a
pencil
by
rubbing
it
against
a
stone
and
had
put
a
keen
edge
on
to
a
long
white
fishbone
that
he
had
selected
now
bill
i
am
ready
said
augusta
seating
herself
resolutely
upon
a
flat
stone
and
setting
her
teeth
my
word
miss
but
you
have
a
fine
pair
of
shoulders
said
the
sailor
contemplating
the
white
expanse
with
the
eye
of
an
artist
i
never
had
such
a
bit
of
material
to
work
on
afore
hang
me
if
it
ai
almost
a
pity
to
mark
not
but
what
tattooing
is
an
ornimint
to
anybody
from
a
princess
down
and
in
that
you
are
fortunit
miss
for
i
larnt
tattooing
from
them
as
tattoo
i
did
augusta
bit
her
lip
and
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
she
was
only
a
woman
and
had
a
woman
little
weakness
and
though
she
had
never
appeared
in
a
low
dress
in
her
life
she
knew
that
her
neck
was
one
of
her
greatest
beauties
and
was
proud
of
it
it
was
hard
to
think
that
she
would
be
marked
all
her
life
with
this
ridiculous
will
that
is
if
she
escaped
and
what
was
more
for
the
benefit
of
a
young
man
who
had
no
claim
upon
her
at
all
that
was
what
she
said
to
herself
but
as
she
said
it
something
in
her
told
her
that
it
was
not
true
something
told
her
that
this
young
eustace
meeson
a
claim
upon
her
the
highest
claim
that
a
man
could
have
upon
a
woman
for
the
truth
must
out
she
loved
him
it
seemed
to
have
come
home
to
her
quite
clearly
here
in
this
dreadful
desolate
place
here
in
the
very
shadow
of
an
awful
death
that
she
did
love
him
truly
and
deeply
and
that
being
so
she
would
not
have
been
what
she
was
a
devoted
woman
had
she
not
at
heart
rejoiced
at
this
opportunity
of
even
though
that
was
of
the
hardest
sort
seeing
that
it
involved
what
all
women
hate
the
endurance
of
a
ridiculous
position
for
love
can
do
all
things
it
can
even
make
its
votaries
brave
ridicule
go
on
she
said
sharply
and
let
us
get
it
over
as
soon
as
possible
very
well
miss
what
is
it
to
be
old
gentleman
cut
it
short
you
know
leave
all
my
property
to
eustace
that
as
short
as
i
can
get
it
and
if
properly
witnessed
i
think
that
it
will
cover
everything
said
meeson
with
a
feeble
air
of
triumph
anyhow
i
never
heard
of
a
will
that
is
to
carry
about
two
millions
being
got
into
nine
words
before
bill
poised
his
fishbone
and
next
second
augusta
gave
a
start
and
a
little
shriek
for
the
operation
had
begun
never
mind
miss
said
bill
consolingly
you
soon
get
used
to
it
after
that
augusta
set
her
teeth
and
endured
in
silence
though
it
really
hurt
her
very
much
for
bill
was
more
careful
of
the
artistic
effect
and
the
permanence
of
the
work
than
of
the
feelings
of
the
subject
experimentum
in
corpore
he
would
have
said
had
he
been
conversant
with
the
classics
without
much
consideration
for
the
so
he
pricked
and
dug
away
with
his
fishbone
which
he
dipped
continually
in
the
and
with
the
sharp
piece
of
wood
till
augusta
began
to
feel
perfectly
faint
for
three
hours
the
work
continued
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
body
of
the
will
was
finished
for
bill
was
a
rapid
worker
being
written
in
letters
right
across
her
shoulders
but
the
signatures
yet
remained
to
be
affixed
bill
asked
her
if
she
would
like
to
let
them
stand
over
till
the
morrow
but
this
although
she
felt
ill
with
the
pain
she
declined
to
do
she
was
marked
now
marked
with
the
ineffaceable
mark
of
bill
so
she
might
as
well
be
marked
to
some
purpose
if
she
put
off
the
signing
of
the
document
till
the
morrow
it
might
be
too
late
meeson
might
be
dead
johnnie
might
have
changed
his
mind
or
a
hundred
things
so
she
told
them
to
go
on
and
finish
it
as
quickly
as
possible
for
there
was
only
about
two
hours
more
daylight
fortunately
meeson
was
more
or
less
acquainted
with
the
formalities
that
are
necessary
in
the
execution
of
a
will
namely
that
the
testator
and
the
two
witnesses
should
all
sign
in
the
presence
of
each
other
he
also
knew
that
it
was
sufficient
if
in
cases
of
illness
some
third
person
held
the
pen
between
the
testator
fingers
and
assisted
him
to
write
his
name
or
even
if
someone
signed
for
the
testator
in
his
presence
and
by
his
direction
and
arguing
from
this
knowledge
he
came
to
the
conclusion
afterwards
justified
in
the
great
case
of
meeson
addison
and
another
that
it
would
be
sufficient
if
he
inflicted
the
first
prick
of
his
signature
and
then
kept
his
hand
upon
bill
while
the
rest
was
done
this
accordingly
he
did
clumsily
running
the
point
of
the
sharp
bone
so
deep
into
the
unfortunate
augusta
that
she
fairly
shrieked
aloud
and
then
keeping
his
hand
upon
the
sailor
arm
while
he
worked
in
the
rest
of
the
signature
when
it
was
done
the
turn
of
johnnie
came
johnnie
had
at
length
aroused
himself
to
some
interest
in
what
was
going
on
and
had
stood
by
watching
all
the
time
since
meeson
having
laid
his
finger
upon
augusta
shoulder
had
solemnly
declared
the
writing
thereon
to
be
his
last
will
and
testament
as
he
johnnie
could
not
tattoo
the
same
process
was
gone
through
with
reference
to
his
signature
as
in
the
case
of
meeson
then
bill
jones
signed
his
own
name
as
the
second
witness
to
the
will
and
just
as
the
light
went
out
of
the
sky
the
document
was
finally
executed
the
date
of
the
execution
being
alone
omitted
augusta
got
up
off
the
flat
stone
where
she
had
been
seated
during
this
torture
for
something
like
five
hours
and
staggering
into
the
hut
threw
herself
down
upon
the
sail
and
went
off
into
a
dead
faint
it
was
indeed
only
by
a
very
strong
exercise
of
the
will
that
she
had
kept
herself
from
fainting
long
before
the
next
thing
she
was
conscious
of
was
a
dreadful
smarting
in
her
back
and
on
opening
her
eyes
found
that
it
was
quite
dark
in
the
hut
so
weary
was
she
however
that
after
stretching
out
her
hand
to
assure
herself
that
dick
was
safe
by
her
side
she
shut
her
eyes
again
and
went
fast
asleep
when
she
woke
the
daylight
was
creeping
into
the
damp
and
squalid
hut
revealing
the
heavy
form
of
meeson
tossing
to
and
fro
in
a
troubled
slumber
on
the
further
side
she
got
up
feeling
dreadfully
sore
about
the
back
and
awaking
the
child
took
him
out
to
the
stream
of
water
and
washed
him
and
herself
as
well
as
she
could
it
was
very
cold
outside
so
cold
that
the
child
cried
and
the
rain
clouds
were
coming
up
fast
so
she
hurried
back
to
the
hut
and
together
with
dick
made
her
breakfast
off
some
biscuit
and
some
roast
eggs
which
were
not
at
all
bad
eating
she
was
indeed
quite
weak
with
hunger
having
swallowed
no
food
for
many
hours
and
felt
proportionately
better
after
it
then
she
turned
to
examine
the
condition
of
meeson
the
will
had
been
executed
none
too
soon
for
it
was
evident
to
her
that
he
was
in
a
very
bad
way
indeed
his
face
was
sunken
and
hectic
with
fever
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
his
talk
though
he
was
now
awake
was
quite
incoherent
she
tried
to
get
him
to
take
some
food
but
he
would
swallow
nothing
but
water
having
done
all
that
she
could
for
him
she
went
out
to
see
the
sailors
and
met
them
coming
down
from
the
flagstaff
they
had
evidently
been
though
not
to
any
great
extent
at
the
rum
cask
again
for
bill
looked
sheepish
and
shaky
while
the
johnnie
was
more
sulky
than
ever
she
gazed
at
them
reproachfully
and
then
asked
them
to
collect
some
more
penguin
eggs
which
johnnie
refused
to
do
saying
that
he
was
going
to
collect
eggs
for
landlubbers
to
eat
she
might
collect
eggs
for
herself
bill
however
started
on
the
errand
and
in
about
an
hour
time
returned
just
as
the
rain
set
in
in
good
earnest
bearing
six
or
seven
dozen
fresh
eggs
tied
up
in
his
coat
augusta
with
the
child
by
her
sat
in
the
miserable
hut
attending
to
meeson
while
outside
the
pitiless
rain
poured
down
in
a
steady
unceasing
sheet
of
water
that
came
through
the
wretched
roof
in
streams
she
did
her
best
to
keep
the
dying
man
dry
but
it
proved
to
be
almost
an
impossibility
for
even
when
she
succeeded
in
preventing
the
wet
from
falling
on
him
from
above
it
got
underneath
him
from
the
reeking
floor
while
the
heavy
damp
of
the
air
gathered
on
his
garments
till
they
were
quite
sodden
as
the
hours
went
on
his
consciousness
came
back
to
him
and
with
it
his
terror
for
the
end
and
his
remorse
for
his
past
life
for
alas
the
millions
he
had
amassed
could
not
avail
him
now
i
am
going
to
die
he
groaned
i
am
going
to
die
and
i
been
a
bad
man
i
been
the
head
of
a
publishing
company
all
my
life
augusta
gently
pointed
out
to
him
that
publishing
was
a
very
respectable
business
when
fairly
and
properly
carried
on
and
not
one
that
ought
to
weigh
heavy
upon
a
man
at
the
last
like
the
record
of
a
career
of
successful
usury
or
burgling
he
shook
his
heavy
head
yes
yes
he
groaned
but
meeson
is
a
company
and
you
are
talking
of
private
firms
they
are
straight
most
of
them
far
too
straight
i
used
always
to
say
but
you
do
know
meeson
you
do
know
the
customs
of
the
trade
at
meeson
augusta
reflected
that
she
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
meeson
than
she
liked
listen
he
said
with
desperate
energy
sitting
up
upon
the
sail
and
i
will
tell
you
i
must
tell
you
asterisks
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
lady
novelist
will
best
represent
the
confession
that
followed
words
are
not
equal
to
the
task
augusta
listened
with
rising
hair
and
realised
how
very
trying
must
be
the
life
of
a
private
confessor
oh
please
stop
she
said
faintly
at
last
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
indeed
ah
he
said
as
he
sunk
back
exhausted
i
thought
that
when
you
understood
the
customs
at
meeson
you
would
feel
for
me
in
my
present
position
think
girl
think
what
i
must
suffer
with
such
a
past
standing
face
to
face
with
an
unknown
future
then
came
a
silence
take
him
away
take
him
away
suddenly
shouted
out
meeson
staring
around
him
with
frightened
eyes
who
asked
augusta
who
him
the
tall
thin
man
with
the
big
book
i
know
him
he
used
to
be
number
he
died
years
ago
he
was
a
very
clever
doctor
but
one
of
his
patients
brought
a
false
charge
against
him
and
ruined
him
so
he
had
to
take
to
writing
poor
devil
we
made
him
edit
a
medical
encyclopaedia
twelve
volumes
for
to
be
paid
on
completion
and
he
went
mad
and
died
at
the
eleventh
volume
so
of
course
we
did
not
pay
his
widow
anything
and
now
he
come
for
me
i
know
he
has
listen
talking
do
you
hear
him
oh
heavens
he
says
that
i
am
going
to
be
an
author
and
he
is
going
to
publish
for
me
for
a
thousand
years
going
to
publish
on
the
system
with
an
annual
account
the
usual
trade
deductions
and
no
vouchers
oh
oh
look
they
are
all
coming
they
are
pouring
out
of
the
hutches
they
are
going
to
murder
me
keep
them
off
keep
them
off
and
he
howled
and
beat
the
air
with
his
hands
augusta
utterly
overcome
by
this
awful
sight
knelt
down
by
his
side
and
tried
to
quiet
him
but
in
vain
he
continued
beating
his
hands
in
the
air
trying
to
keep
off
the
ghostly
train
till
at
last
with
one
awful
howl
he
fell
back
dead
and
that
was
the
end
of
meeson
and
the
works
that
he
published
and
the
money
that
he
made
and
the
house
that
he
built
and
the
evil
that
he
did
are
they
not
written
in
the
book
of
the
commercial
kings
well
said
augusta
faintly
to
herself
when
she
had
got
her
breath
back
a
little
i
am
glad
that
it
is
over
anyway
i
do
hope
that
i
may
never
be
called
on
to
nurse
the
head
of
another
publishing
company
auntie
auntie
gasped
dick
why
do
the
gentleman
shout
so
then
taking
the
frightened
child
by
the
hand
augusta
made
her
way
through
the
rain
to
the
other
hut
in
order
to
tell
the
two
sailors
what
had
come
to
pass
it
had
no
door
and
she
paused
on
the
threshold
to
prospect
the
faint
foggy
light
was
so
dim
that
at
first
she
could
see
nothing
presently
however
her
eyes
got
accustomed
to
it
and
she
made
out
bill
and
johnnie
sitting
opposite
to
each
other
on
the
ground
between
them
was
the
breaker
of
rum
bill
had
a
large
shell
in
his
had
which
he
had
just
filled
from
the
cask
for
augusta
saw
him
in
the
act
of
replacing
the
spigot
my
go
curse
you
my
go
said
johnnie
as
bill
lifted
the
shell
of
spirits
to
his
lips
you
had
seven
goes
and
i
only
had
six
you
be
blowed
said
bill
swallowing
the
liquor
in
a
couple
of
great
gulps
ah
that
better
now
i
fill
for
you
mate
fair
does
i
says
fair
does
and
no
favour
and
he
filled
accordingly
meeson
is
dead
said
augusta
screwing
up
her
courage
to
interrupt
this
orgie
the
two
men
stared
at
her
in
drunken
surprise
which
johnnie
broke
now
is
he
miss
he
said
with
a
hiccough
is
he
well
a
good
job
too
says
i
a
useless
old
landlubber
he
was
i
doubt
he
off
to
a
warmer
place
than
this
kerguelen
land
and
i
drinks
his
health
which
i
never
had
the
occasion
to
do
before
here
to
the
health
of
the
departed
and
he
swallowed
the
shellfull
of
rum
at
a
draught
your
sentiment
i
echoes
said
bill
johnnie
the
shell
give
us
the
shell
to
drink
the
of
the
dear
departed
then
augusta
returned
to
her
hut
with
a
heavy
heart
she
covered
up
the
dead
body
as
best
she
could
telling
little
dick
that
meeson
was
gone
and
then
sat
down
in
that
chill
and
awful
company
it
was
very
depressing
but
she
comforted
herself
somewhat
with
the
reflection
that
on
the
whole
meeson
dead
was
not
so
bad
as
meeson
in
the
animated
flesh
presently
the
night
set
in
once
more
and
worn
out
with
all
that
she
had
gone
through
augusta
said
her
prayers
and
went
to
sleep
with
little
dick
locked
fast
in
her
arms
some
hours
afterwards
she
was
awakened
by
loud
and
uproarious
shouts
made
up
of
snatches
of
drunken
songs
and
that
peculiar
class
of
english
that
hovers
ever
round
the
lips
of
the
british
tar
evidently
bill
and
johnnie
were
raging
drunk
and
in
this
condition
were
taking
the
midnight
air
the
shouting
and
swearing
went
reeling
away
towards
the
water
edge
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
culminated
in
a
fearful
yell
after
which
came
silence
what
could
it
mean
wondered
augusta
and
whilst
she
was
still
wondering
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
chapter
xi
rescued
augusta
woke
up
just
as
the
dawn
was
stealing
across
the
sodden
sky
it
was
the
smarting
of
her
shoulders
that
woke
her
she
rose
leaving
dick
yet
asleep
and
remembering
the
turmoil
of
the
night
hurried
to
the
other
hut
it
was
empty
she
turned
and
looked
about
her
about
fifteen
paces
from
where
she
was
lay
the
shell
that
the
two
drunkards
had
used
as
a
cup
going
forward
she
picked
it
up
it
still
smelt
disgustingly
of
spirits
evidently
the
two
men
had
dropped
it
in
the
course
of
their
midnight
walk
or
rather
roll
where
had
they
gone
to
straight
in
front
of
her
a
rocky
promontory
ran
out
fifty
paces
or
more
into
the
waters
of
the
bay
she
walked
along
it
aimlessly
till
presently
she
perceived
one
of
the
sailor
hats
lying
on
the
ground
or
rather
floating
in
a
pool
of
water
clearly
they
had
gone
this
way
on
she
went
to
the
point
of
the
little
headland
sheer
over
the
water
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
not
a
single
vestige
of
bill
and
johnnie
aimlessly
enough
she
leant
forward
and
stared
over
the
rocky
wall
and
down
into
the
clear
water
and
then
started
back
with
a
little
cry
no
wonder
that
she
started
for
there
on
the
sand
beneath
a
fathom
and
a
half
of
quiet
water
lay
the
bodies
of
the
two
men
they
were
locked
in
each
other
arms
and
lay
as
though
they
were
asleep
upon
that
ocean
bed
how
they
came
to
their
end
she
never
knew
perhaps
they
quarrelled
in
their
drunken
anger
and
fell
over
the
little
cliff
or
perhaps
they
stumbled
and
fell
not
knowing
whither
they
were
going
who
can
say
at
any
rate
there
they
were
and
there
they
remained
till
the
outgoing
tide
floated
them
off
to
join
the
great
army
of
their
companions
who
had
gone
down
with
the
kangaroo
and
so
augusta
was
left
alone
with
a
heavy
heart
she
returned
to
the
hut
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
solitude
and
the
sense
that
in
the
midst
of
so
much
death
she
could
not
hope
to
escape
there
was
no
human
creature
left
alive
in
that
vast
lonely
land
except
the
child
and
herself
and
so
far
as
she
could
see
their
fate
would
soon
be
as
the
fate
of
the
others
when
she
got
back
to
the
hut
dick
was
awake
and
was
crying
for
her
the
still
stiff
form
of
meeson
stretched
out
beneath
the
sail
frightened
the
little
lad
he
did
not
know
why
augusta
took
him
into
her
arms
and
kissed
him
passionately
she
loved
the
child
for
his
own
sake
and
besides
he
and
he
alone
stood
between
her
and
utter
solitude
then
she
took
him
across
to
the
other
hut
which
had
been
vacated
by
the
sailors
for
it
was
impossible
to
stay
in
the
one
with
the
body
which
was
too
heavy
for
her
to
move
in
the
centre
of
the
sailors
hut
stood
the
cask
of
rum
which
had
been
the
cause
of
their
destruction
it
was
nearly
empty
now
so
light
indeed
that
she
had
no
difficulty
in
rolling
it
to
one
side
she
cleaned
out
the
place
as
well
as
she
could
and
returning
to
where
meeson
body
lay
fetched
the
bag
of
biscuits
and
the
roasted
eggs
after
which
they
had
their
breakfast
fortunately
there
was
but
little
rain
that
morning
so
augusta
took
dick
out
to
look
for
eggs
not
because
they
wanted
any
more
but
in
order
to
employ
themselves
together
they
climbed
up
on
to
a
rocky
headland
where
the
flag
was
flying
and
looked
out
across
the
troubled
ocean
there
was
nothing
in
sight
so
far
as
the
eye
could
see
nothing
but
the
white
across
which
the
black
cormorants
steered
their
swift
unerring
flight
she
looked
and
looked
till
her
heart
sank
within
her
will
mummy
soon
come
in
a
boat
to
take
dick
away
asked
the
child
at
her
side
and
then
she
burst
into
tears
when
she
had
recovered
herself
they
set
to
collecting
eggs
an
occupation
which
notwithstanding
the
screams
and
threatened
attacks
of
the
birds
delighted
dick
greatly
soon
they
had
as
many
as
she
could
carry
so
they
went
back
to
the
hut
and
lit
a
fire
of
and
roasted
some
eggs
in
the
hot
ashes
she
had
no
pot
to
boil
them
in
thus
one
way
and
another
the
day
wore
away
and
at
last
the
darkness
began
to
fall
over
the
rugged
peaks
behind
and
the
wild
wilderness
of
sea
before
she
put
dick
to
bed
and
he
went
off
to
sleep
indeed
it
was
wonderful
to
see
how
well
the
child
bore
the
hardships
through
which
they
were
passing
he
never
had
an
ache
or
a
pain
or
even
a
cold
in
the
head
after
dick
was
asleep
augusta
sat
or
rather
lay
in
the
dark
listening
to
the
moaning
of
the
wind
as
it
beat
upon
the
shanty
and
passed
away
in
gusts
among
the
cliffs
and
mountains
beyond
the
loneliness
was
something
awful
and
together
with
the
thought
of
what
the
end
of
it
would
probably
be
quite
broke
her
spirit
down
she
knew
that
the
chances
of
her
escape
were
small
indeed
ships
did
not
often
come
to
this
dreadful
and
uninhabited
coast
and
if
one
should
happen
to
put
in
there
it
was
exceedingly
probable
that
it
would
touch
at
some
other
point
and
never
see
her
or
her
flag
and
then
in
time
the
end
would
come
the
supply
of
eggs
would
fail
and
she
would
be
driven
to
supporting
life
upon
such
birds
as
she
could
catch
till
at
last
the
child
sickened
and
died
and
she
followed
it
to
that
dim
land
that
lies
beyond
kerguelen
and
the
world
she
prayed
that
the
child
might
die
first
it
was
awful
to
think
that
perhaps
it
might
be
the
other
way
about
she
might
die
first
and
the
child
might
be
left
to
starve
beside
her
the
morrow
would
be
christmas
day
last
christmas
day
she
had
spent
with
her
dead
sister
at
birmingham
she
remembered
that
they
went
to
church
in
the
morning
and
after
dinner
she
had
finished
correcting
the
last
revises
of
vow
well
it
seemed
likely
that
long
before
another
christmas
came
she
would
have
gone
to
join
little
jeannie
and
then
being
a
good
and
religious
girl
augusta
rose
to
her
knees
and
prayed
to
heaven
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
to
rescue
them
from
their
terrible
position
or
if
she
was
doomed
to
perish
at
least
to
save
the
child
and
so
the
long
cold
night
wore
away
in
thought
and
vigil
till
at
last
some
two
hours
before
the
dawn
she
got
to
sleep
when
she
opened
her
eyes
again
it
was
broad
daylight
and
little
dick
who
had
been
awake
some
time
beside
her
was
sitting
up
playing
with
the
shell
which
bill
and
johnnie
had
used
to
drink
rum
out
of
she
rose
and
put
the
things
a
little
to
rights
and
then
as
it
was
not
raining
told
him
to
run
outside
while
she
went
through
the
form
of
dressing
by
taking
off
such
garments
as
she
had
shaking
them
and
putting
them
on
again
she
was
slowly
going
through
this
process
and
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
her
shoulders
ceased
to
smart
from
the
effects
of
the
tattooing
when
dick
came
running
in
without
going
through
the
formality
of
knocking
oh
auntie
auntie
he
sang
out
in
high
glee
here
a
big
ship
coming
sailing
along
is
it
mummy
and
daddie
coming
to
fetch
dick
augusta
sank
back
faint
with
the
sudden
revulsion
of
feeling
if
there
was
a
ship
they
were
saved
snatched
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
but
perhaps
it
was
the
child
fancy
she
threw
on
the
body
of
her
dress
and
her
long
yellow
hair
which
she
had
in
default
of
better
means
been
trying
to
comb
out
with
a
bit
of
wood
streaming
behind
her
she
took
the
child
by
the
hand
and
flew
as
fast
as
she
could
go
down
the
little
rocky
promontory
off
which
bill
and
johnnie
had
met
their
end
before
she
got
down
it
she
saw
that
the
child
tale
was
true
for
there
sailing
right
up
the
fjord
from
the
open
sea
was
a
large
vessel
she
was
not
two
hundred
yards
from
where
she
stood
and
her
canvas
was
being
rapidly
furled
preparatory
to
the
anchor
being
dropped
thanking
providence
for
the
sight
as
she
never
thanked
anything
before
augusta
sped
on
till
she
got
to
the
extreme
point
of
the
promontory
and
stood
there
waving
dick
little
cap
towards
the
vessel
which
moved
slowly
and
majestically
on
till
presently
across
the
clear
water
came
the
splash
of
the
anchor
followed
by
the
sound
of
the
fierce
rattle
of
the
chain
through
the
then
there
came
another
sound
the
glad
sound
of
human
voices
cheering
she
had
been
seen
five
minutes
passed
and
then
she
saw
a
boat
lowered
and
manned
the
oars
were
got
out
and
presently
it
was
backing
water
within
ten
paces
of
her
go
round
there
she
called
pointing
to
the
little
bay
and
i
will
meet
you
by
the
time
that
she
had
got
to
the
spot
the
boat
was
already
beached
and
a
tall
thin
man
was
addressing
her
in
an
unmistakable
yankee
accent
cast
away
miss
he
said
interrogatively
yes
gasped
augusta
we
are
the
survivors
of
the
kangaroo
which
sank
in
a
collision
with
a
whaler
about
a
week
ago
ah
said
the
captain
with
a
whaler
then
i
guess
that
where
my
consort
has
gone
to
she
been
missing
about
a
week
and
i
put
in
here
to
see
if
i
could
get
upon
her
tracks
also
to
fill
up
with
water
well
she
was
well
insured
anyway
and
when
last
we
spoke
her
she
had
made
a
very
poor
catch
but
perhaps
miss
you
will
at
your
convenience
favour
me
with
a
few
particulars
accordingly
augusta
sketched
the
history
of
their
terrible
adventure
in
as
few
words
as
possible
and
the
tale
was
one
that
made
even
the
phlegmatic
yankee
captain
stare
then
she
took
him
followed
by
the
crew
to
the
hut
where
meeson
lay
dead
and
to
the
other
hut
where
she
and
dick
had
slept
upon
the
previous
night
wall
miss
said
the
captain
whose
name
was
thomas
i
guess
that
you
and
the
youngster
will
be
almost
ready
to
vacate
these
apartments
so
if
you
please
i
will
send
you
off
to
the
ship
the
harpoon
that
her
name
of
norfolk
in
the
united
states
you
will
find
her
well
flavoured
with
oil
for
we
are
about
full
to
the
hatches
but
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
you
will
not
mind
that
anyway
my
missus
who
is
aboard
having
come
the
cruise
for
her
health
and
who
is
an
englishwoman
like
you
will
do
all
she
can
to
make
you
comfortable
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
miss
if
i
was
in
any
way
pious
i
should
just
thank
the
almighty
that
i
happened
to
see
that
there
bit
of
a
flag
with
my
spyglass
as
i
was
sailing
along
the
coast
at
this
morning
for
i
had
no
intention
of
putting
in
at
this
creek
but
at
one
twenty
miles
along
and
now
miss
if
you
go
aboard
some
of
us
will
stop
and
just
tuck
up
the
dead
gentleman
as
well
as
we
can
augusta
thanked
him
from
her
heart
and
going
into
the
hut
got
her
hat
and
the
roll
of
sovereigns
which
had
been
meeson
but
which
he
had
told
her
to
take
leaving
the
blankets
to
be
brought
by
the
men
then
two
of
the
sailors
got
into
the
little
boat
belonging
to
the
kangaroo
in
which
augusta
had
escaped
and
rowed
her
and
dick
away
from
that
hateful
shore
to
where
the
whaler
a
was
lying
at
anchor
as
they
drew
near
she
saw
the
rest
of
the
crew
of
the
harpoon
among
whom
was
a
woman
watching
their
advent
from
the
deck
who
when
she
got
her
foot
upon
the
companion
ladder
one
and
all
set
up
a
hearty
cheer
in
another
moment
she
was
on
deck
which
notwithstanding
its
abominable
smell
of
oil
seemed
to
her
the
fairest
and
most
delightful
place
that
her
eyes
had
ever
rested
on
and
being
almost
hugged
by
thomas
a
woman
of
about
thirty
the
daughter
of
a
suffolk
farmer
who
had
emigrated
to
the
states
and
then
of
course
she
had
to
tell
her
story
all
over
again
after
which
she
was
led
off
to
the
cabin
occupied
by
the
captain
and
his
wife
and
which
thenceforth
was
occupied
by
augusta
thomas
and
little
dick
the
captain
shaking
down
where
he
could
and
here
for
the
first
time
for
nearly
a
week
she
was
able
to
wash
and
dress
herself
properly
and
oh
the
luxury
of
it
nobody
knows
what
the
delights
of
clean
linen
really
mean
till
he
or
she
has
had
to
dispense
with
it
under
circumstances
of
privation
nor
have
they
the
slightest
idea
of
what
a
difference
to
one
and
comfort
is
made
by
the
possession
or
of
an
article
so
common
as
a
comb
whilst
augusta
was
still
combing
out
her
hair
with
sighs
of
delight
thomas
knocked
at
the
door
and
was
admitted
my
miss
what
beautiful
hair
you
have
now
that
it
is
combed
out
she
said
in
admiration
why
whatever
is
that
upon
your
shoulders
then
augusta
had
to
tell
the
tale
of
the
tattooing
which
it
struck
her
it
was
wise
to
do
so
seeing
that
she
thus
secured
a
witness
to
the
fact
that
she
was
already
tattooed
on
leaving
kerguelen
land
and
that
the
operation
had
been
of
such
recent
infliction
that
the
flesh
was
still
inflamed
with
it
this
was
the
more
necessary
as
the
tattooing
was
undated
thomas
listened
to
the
story
with
her
mouth
open
lost
between
admiration
of
augusta
courage
and
regret
that
her
shoulders
should
have
been
ruined
in
that
fashion
well
the
least
that
he
alluding
to
eustace
can
do
is
to
marry
you
after
you
have
spoilt
yourself
in
that
fashion
for
his
benefit
said
the
practical
thomas
nonsense
thomas
said
augusta
blushing
till
the
tattoo
marks
on
her
shoulders
looked
like
blue
lines
in
a
sea
of
crimson
and
stamping
her
foot
with
such
energy
that
her
hostess
jumped
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
give
an
innocent
remark
such
a
warm
reception
but
then
as
the
reader
will
no
doubt
have
observed
the
reluctance
that
some
young
women
show
to
talking
of
the
possibility
of
their
marriage
to
the
man
they
happen
to
have
set
their
hearts
on
is
only
equalled
by
the
alacrity
with
which
they
marry
him
when
the
time
comes
having
set
dick
and
augusta
down
to
a
breakfast
of
porridge
and
coffee
which
both
of
them
thought
delicious
though
the
fare
was
really
rather
coarse
thomas
being
unable
to
restrain
her
curiosity
rowed
off
to
the
land
to
see
the
huts
and
also
meeson
remains
which
though
not
a
pleasant
sight
were
undoubtedly
an
interesting
one
with
her
too
went
most
of
the
crew
bent
upon
the
same
errand
and
also
on
obtaining
water
of
which
the
harpoon
was
short
as
soon
as
she
was
left
alone
augusta
went
back
to
the
cabin
taking
dick
with
her
and
laid
down
on
the
berth
with
a
feeling
of
safety
and
thankfulness
to
which
she
had
long
been
a
stranger
where
very
soon
she
fell
sound
asleep
chapter
xii
southampton
quay
when
augusta
opened
her
eyes
again
she
became
conscious
of
a
violent
rolling
motion
that
she
could
not
mistake
they
were
at
sea
she
got
up
smoothed
her
hair
and
went
on
deck
to
find
that
she
had
slept
for
many
hours
for
the
sun
was
setting
she
went
aft
to
where
thomas
was
sitting
near
the
wheel
with
little
dick
beside
her
and
after
greeting
them
turned
to
watch
the
sunset
the
sight
was
a
beautiful
one
enough
for
the
great
waves
driven
by
the
westerly
wind
which
in
these
latitudes
is
nearly
always
blowing
half
a
gale
were
rushing
past
them
wild
and
free
and
the
sharp
spray
of
their
foaming
crests
struck
upon
her
forehead
like
a
whip
the
sun
was
setting
and
the
arrows
of
the
dying
light
flew
fast
and
far
across
the
billowy
bosom
of
the
deep
fast
and
far
they
flew
from
the
stormy
glory
in
the
west
lighting
up
the
pale
surfaces
of
cloud
and
tinging
the
grey
waters
of
that
majestic
sea
with
a
lurid
hue
of
blood
they
kissed
the
bellying
sails
and
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
vessel
lofty
trucks
and
then
travelled
on
and
away
and
away
through
the
great
empyrean
of
space
till
they
broke
and
vanished
upon
the
horizon
rounded
edge
there
behind
them
miles
behind
kerguelen
land
reared
its
fierce
cliffs
against
the
twilight
sky
clear
and
desolate
they
towered
in
an
unutterable
solitude
and
on
their
snowy
surfaces
the
sunbeams
beat
coldly
as
the
warm
breath
of
some
human
passion
beating
on
aphrodite
marble
breast
augusta
gazed
upon
those
drear
cliffs
that
had
so
nearly
proved
her
monumental
pile
and
shuddered
it
was
as
a
hideous
dream
and
then
the
dark
and
creeping
shadows
of
the
night
threw
their
veils
around
and
over
them
and
they
vanished
they
were
swallowed
up
in
blackness
and
she
lost
sight
of
them
and
of
the
great
seas
that
forever
beat
and
churn
about
their
stony
feet
nor
except
in
dreams
did
she
again
set
her
eyes
upon
their
measureless
solitude
the
night
arose
in
strength
and
shook
a
golden
dew
of
stars
from
the
tresses
of
her
streaming
clouds
till
the
wonderful
deep
heavens
sparkled
with
a
myriad
gemmy
points
the
west
wind
going
on
his
way
sung
his
wild
chant
amongst
the
cordage
and
rushed
among
the
sails
as
with
a
rush
of
wings
the
ship
leant
over
like
a
maiden
shrinking
from
a
kiss
then
shivering
fled
away
leaping
from
billow
to
billow
as
they
rose
and
tossed
their
white
arms
about
her
fain
to
drag
her
down
and
hold
her
to
ocean
heaving
breast
the
rigging
tautened
and
the
huge
sails
flapped
in
thunder
as
the
harpoon
sped
upon
her
course
and
all
around
was
greatness
and
the
present
majesty
of
power
augusta
looked
aloft
and
sighed
she
knew
not
why
the
swift
blood
of
youth
coursed
through
her
veins
and
she
rejoiced
exceedingly
that
life
and
all
its
possibilities
yet
lay
before
her
but
a
little
more
of
that
dreadful
place
and
they
would
have
lain
behind
her
days
would
have
been
numbered
before
she
scarce
had
time
to
strike
a
blow
in
the
great
human
struggle
that
rages
ceaselessly
from
age
to
age
the
voice
of
her
genius
would
have
been
hushed
just
as
its
notes
began
to
thrill
and
her
message
would
never
have
been
spoken
in
the
world
but
now
time
was
once
more
before
her
and
oh
the
nearness
of
death
had
taught
her
the
unspeakable
value
of
that
one
asset
on
which
we
can
rely
life
not
indeed
that
life
for
which
so
many
live
the
life
led
for
self
and
having
for
its
principle
if
not
its
only
end
the
gratification
of
the
desires
of
self
but
an
altogether
higher
life
a
life
devoted
to
telling
that
which
her
keen
instinct
knew
was
truth
and
however
imperfectly
painting
with
the
pigment
of
her
noble
art
those
visions
of
beauty
which
sometimes
seemed
to
rest
upon
her
soul
like
shadows
from
the
heaven
of
our
hones
three
months
have
passed
three
long
months
of
tossing
waters
and
winds
the
harpoon
shaping
her
course
for
norfolk
in
the
united
states
had
made
but
a
poor
passage
of
it
she
got
into
the
trades
and
all
went
well
till
they
made
paul
rocks
where
they
were
detained
by
the
doldrums
and
variable
winds
afterwards
she
passed
into
the
trades
and
then
further
north
met
a
series
of
westerly
gales
that
ultimately
drove
her
to
the
azores
just
as
her
crew
were
getting
very
short
of
water
and
provisions
and
here
augusta
bid
farewell
to
her
friend
the
yankee
skipper
for
the
whaler
that
had
saved
her
life
and
dick
after
refitting
once
more
set
sail
upon
its
almost
endless
voyage
she
stood
on
the
breakwater
at
ponta
delgada
and
watched
the
harpoon
drop
past
the
men
recognized
her
and
cheered
lustily
and
captain
thomas
took
off
his
hat
for
the
entire
ship
company
down
to
the
were
in
love
with
augusta
and
the
extraordinary
offerings
that
they
had
made
her
on
parting
most
of
them
connected
in
some
way
or
other
with
that
noble
animal
the
whale
sufficed
to
fill
a
augusta
waved
her
handkerchief
to
them
in
answer
but
she
could
not
see
much
of
them
because
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
she
had
had
quite
enough
of
the
harpoon
and
yet
she
was
loth
so
say
farewell
to
her
for
her
days
on
board
had
in
many
respects
been
restful
and
happy
ones
they
had
given
her
space
and
time
to
brace
herself
up
before
she
plunged
once
more
into
the
struggle
of
active
life
besides
she
had
throughout
been
treated
with
that
unvarying
kindness
and
consideration
for
which
the
american
people
are
justly
noted
in
their
dealings
with
all
persons
in
misfortune
but
augusta
was
not
the
only
person
who
with
sorrow
watched
the
departure
of
the
harpoon
first
there
was
little
dick
who
had
acquired
a
fine
yankee
drawl
and
grown
quite
half
an
inch
on
board
of
her
and
who
fairly
howled
when
his
particular
friend
a
remarkably
fierce
and
boatswain
brought
him
as
a
parting
offering
a
large
whale
tooth
patiently
carved
by
himself
with
a
spirited
picture
of
their
rescue
on
kerguelen
land
then
there
was
thomas
herself
when
they
finally
reached
the
island
of
michael
in
the
azores
augusta
had
offered
to
pay
fifty
pounds
being
half
of
the
hundred
sovereigns
given
to
her
by
meeson
to
captain
thomas
as
a
passage
fee
knowing
that
he
was
by
no
moans
overburdened
with
the
goods
of
this
world
but
he
stoutly
declined
to
touch
a
farthing
saying
that
it
would
be
unlucky
to
take
money
from
a
castaway
augusta
as
stoutly
insisted
and
finally
a
compromise
was
come
to
thomas
was
anxious
being
seized
with
that
acute
species
of
from
which
suffolk
people
are
no
more
exempt
than
other
folk
to
visit
the
land
where
she
was
born
and
the
people
midst
whom
she
was
bred
up
but
this
she
could
not
well
afford
to
do
therefore
augusta
proffered
fifty
pounds
was
appropriated
to
this
purpose
and
thomas
stopped
with
augusta
at
ponta
delgada
waiting
for
the
london
and
west
india
line
packet
to
take
them
to
southampton
so
it
came
to
pass
that
they
stood
together
on
the
ponta
delgada
breakwater
and
together
saw
the
harpoon
sail
off
towards
the
setting
sun
then
came
a
soft
dreamy
fortnight
in
the
fair
island
of
michael
where
nature
is
ever
as
a
bride
and
never
reaches
the
stage
of
the
mother
lank
and
lean
with
the
burden
of
maternity
the
mental
act
of
looking
back
to
this
time
in
after
years
always
recalled
to
augusta
senses
the
odor
of
and
the
sight
of
the
rich
blushing
the
roses
down
it
was
a
pleasant
time
for
the
english
consul
there
most
hospitably
entertained
them
with
much
more
personal
enthusiasm
indeed
than
he
generally
considered
it
necessary
to
show
towards
shipwrecked
voyagers
a
class
of
people
of
whom
consular
representatives
abroad
must
get
rather
tired
with
their
eternal
misfortunes
and
their
perennial
want
of
clothes
indeed
the
only
drawback
to
her
enjoyment
was
that
the
consul
a
gallant
official
with
red
hair
equally
charmed
by
her
adventures
her
literary
fame
and
her
person
showed
a
decided
disposition
to
fall
in
love
with
her
and
a
and
therefore
ardent
consular
officer
is
under
those
circumstances
a
somewhat
alarming
personage
but
the
time
went
on
without
anything
serious
happening
and
at
last
one
morning
after
breakfast
a
man
came
running
up
with
the
information
that
the
mail
was
in
sight
and
so
augusta
took
an
affectionate
farewell
of
the
consul
who
gazed
at
her
through
his
eyeglass
and
sighed
when
he
thought
of
what
might
have
been
in
the
sweet
and
the
ship
bell
rang
and
the
screw
began
to
turn
leaving
the
consul
still
sighing
on
the
horizon
and
in
due
course
augusta
and
thomas
found
themselves
standing
on
the
quay
at
southampton
the
centre
of
an
admiring
and
enthusiastic
crowd
the
captain
had
told
the
extraordinary
tale
to
the
port
officials
when
they
boarded
the
vessel
and
on
getting
ashore
the
port
officials
had
made
haste
to
tell
every
living
soul
they
met
the
wonderful
news
that
two
survivors
of
the
kangaroo
the
history
of
whose
tragic
end
had
sent
a
thrill
of
horror
through
the
world
were
safe
and
sound
on
board
the
west
india
boat
thus
by
the
time
that
augusta
thomas
and
dick
were
safe
on
shore
their
story
or
rather
sundry
distorted
versions
of
it
was
flashing
up
the
wires
to
the
various
press
agencies
and
running
through
southampton
like
scarcely
were
their
feet
set
upon
the
quay
when
with
a
rush
and
a
bound
wild
men
with
in
their
hands
sprang
upon
them
and
beat
them
down
with
a
rain
of
questions
augusta
found
it
impossible
to
answer
them
all
at
once
so
contented
herself
with
saying
yes
yes
yes
to
everything
out
of
which
she
afterwards
found
to
her
surprise
these
fierce
and
active
pressmen
contrived
to
make
up
a
sufficiently
moving
tale
which
included
glowing
accounts
of
the
horrors
of
the
shipwreck
and
what
rather
took
her
aback
a
positive
statement
that
she
and
the
sailors
had
lived
for
a
fortnight
upon
the
broiled
remains
of
meeson
one
interviewer
being
a
small
man
and
therefore
unable
to
kick
and
fight
his
way
through
the
ring
which
surrounded
augusta
and
thomas
seized
upon
little
dick
and
commenced
to
chirp
and
snap
his
fingers
at
him
in
the
intervals
of
asking
him
such
questions
as
he
thought
suitable
to
his
years
dick
dreadfully
alarmed
fled
with
a
howl
but
this
did
not
prevent
a
column
and
a
half
of
matter
headed
the
infant
tale
of
woe
from
appearing
that
very
day
in
a
journal
noted
for
the
accuracy
and
unsensational
character
of
its
communications
nor
was
the
army
of
interviewers
the
only
terror
that
they
had
to
face
little
girls
gave
them
bouquets
an
old
lady
whose
brain
was
permeated
with
the
idea
that
shipwrecked
people
went
about
in
a
condition
of
undress
for
much
longer
than
was
necessary
after
the
event
arrived
with
an
armful
of
streaming
on
the
breeze
and
last
but
not
least
a
tall
gentleman
with
a
beautiful
moustache
thrust
into
augusta
hand
a
note
hastily
written
in
pencil
which
when
opened
proved
to
be
an
of
however
at
last
they
found
themselves
in
a
carriage
ready
to
start
or
rather
starting
the
interviewing
gentlemen
two
of
whom
had
their
heads
jammed
through
the
window
were
forcibly
drawn
away
still
asking
questions
by
the
officials
the
tall
gentleman
with
the
moustache
who
was
hovering
in
the
background
smiled
a
soft
farewell
in
which
modesty
struggled
visibly
with
hope
the
took
off
his
cap
and
in
another
minute
they
were
rolling
out
of
southampton
station
augusta
sank
back
with
a
sigh
of
relief
and
then
burst
out
laughing
at
the
thought
of
the
gentleman
with
the
fair
moustachios
on
the
seat
opposite
to
her
somebody
had
thoughtfully
placed
a
number
of
the
papers
she
took
up
the
first
that
came
to
hand
and
glanced
at
it
idly
with
the
idea
of
trying
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
events
her
eyes
fell
instantly
upon
the
name
of
gladstone
printed
all
over
the
sheet
in
type
of
varying
size
and
she
sighed
life
on
the
ocean
wave
had
been
perilous
and
disagreeable
enough
but
at
any
rate
she
had
been
free
from
gladstone
and
his
doings
whatever
evil
might
be
said
of
him
he
was
an
old
man
of
the
sea
turning
the
paper
over
impatiently
she
came
upon
the
reports
of
the
probate
divorce
and
admiralty
division
of
the
high
court
the
first
report
ran
thus
before
the
right
honourable
the
president
in
the
matter
of
meeson
deceased
this
was
an
application
arising
out
of
the
loss
of
kangaroo
on
the
eighteenth
of
december
last
it
will
be
remembered
that
out
of
about
a
thousand
souls
on
board
that
vessel
the
occupants
of
one
boat
only
people
in
all
were
saved
among
the
drowned
was
meeson
the
head
of
the
birmingham
publishing
company
of
meeson
addison
and
roscoe
and
limited
who
was
at
the
time
on
a
visit
to
new
zealand
and
australia
in
connection
with
the
business
of
the
company
fiddlestick
who
with
pearl
appeared
for
the
applicants
and
who
was
somewhat
imperfectly
heard
stated
that
the
facts
connected
with
the
sinking
of
the
kangaroo
would
probably
still
be
so
fresh
in
his
lordship
mind
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
for
him
to
detail
them
although
he
had
them
upon
affidavit
before
him
his
lordship
would
remember
that
but
one
of
people
had
survived
from
this
perhaps
the
most
terrible
shipwreck
of
the
generation
among
the
drowned
was
meeson
and
this
application
was
on
behalf
of
the
executors
of
his
will
for
leave
to
presume
his
death
the
property
which
passed
under
the
will
was
very
large
indeed
amounting
in
all
fiddlestick
understood
to
about
two
millions
sterling
which
perhaps
might
incline
his
lordship
to
proceed
very
carefully
in
allowing
probate
to
issue
the
president
well
the
amount
of
the
property
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
principles
on
which
the
court
acts
with
regard
to
the
presumption
of
death
fiddlestick
quite
so
my
lord
and
i
think
that
in
this
case
your
lordship
will
be
satisfied
that
there
is
no
reason
why
probate
should
not
issue
it
is
humanly
speaking
impossible
that
meeson
can
have
escaped
the
general
destruction
the
president
have
you
any
affidavit
from
anybody
who
saw
meeson
in
the
water
no
my
lord
i
have
an
affidavit
from
a
sailor
named
okers
the
only
man
who
was
picked
up
in
the
water
after
the
kangaroo
foundered
which
states
that
he
believes
that
he
saw
meeson
spring
from
the
ship
into
the
water
but
the
affidavit
does
not
carry
the
matter
further
he
can
not
swear
that
it
was
meeson
the
president
well
i
think
that
that
will
do
the
court
is
necessarily
adverse
to
allowing
the
presumption
of
death
except
on
evidence
of
the
most
satisfactory
nature
still
considering
that
nearly
four
months
have
now
passed
since
the
foundering
of
the
kangaroo
under
circumstances
which
make
it
exceedingly
improbable
that
there
were
any
other
survivors
i
think
that
it
may
fairly
presume
that
meeson
shared
the
fate
of
the
other
passengers
fiddlestick
the
death
to
be
presumed
from
the
of
december
the
president
yes
from
the
eighteenth
fiddlestick
if
your
lordship
pleases
augusta
put
down
the
paper
with
a
gasp
there
was
she
safe
and
sound
with
the
true
last
will
of
meeson
tattooed
upon
her
and
probate
had
issued
whatever
that
mysterious
formula
might
mean
to
another
will
not
the
real
last
will
it
meant
as
she
in
her
ignorance
supposed
that
her
will
was
no
good
that
she
had
endured
that
abominable
tattooing
to
no
purpose
and
was
to
no
purpose
scarred
for
life
it
was
too
much
and
in
a
fit
of
vexation
she
flung
the
out
of
the
window
and
cast
herself
back
on
the
cushion
feeling
very
much
inclined
to
cry

eustace
buys
a
paper
in
due
course
the
train
that
bore
augusta
and
her
fortunes
timed
to
reach
waterloo
at
rolled
into
the
station
the
train
was
a
fast
one
but
the
telegraph
had
been
faster
all
the
evening
papers
had
come
out
with
accounts
more
or
less
accurate
of
their
escape
and
most
of
them
had
added
that
the
two
survivors
would
reach
waterloo
by
the
train
the
consequence
was
that
when
the
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
augusta
on
looking
out
was
horrified
to
see
a
dense
mass
of
human
beings
being
kept
in
check
by
a
line
of
policemen
however
the
guard
was
holding
the
door
open
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
out
which
she
did
taking
dick
by
the
hand
a
proceeding
that
necessarily
put
her
identity
beyond
a
doubt
the
moment
she
got
her
foot
on
to
the
platform
the
crowd
saw
her
and
there
arose
such
a
tremendous
shout
of
welcome
that
she
very
nearly
took
refuge
again
in
the
carriage
for
a
moment
she
stood
hesitating
and
the
crowd
seeing
how
sweet
and
beautiful
she
was
for
the
three
months
of
sea
air
had
made
her
stouter
and
even
more
lovely
cheered
again
with
that
peculiar
enthusiasm
which
a
discerning
public
always
shows
for
a
pretty
face
but
even
while
she
stood
bewildered
on
the
platform
she
heard
a
loud
make
way
make
way
there
and
saw
the
multitude
being
divided
by
a
little
knot
of
officials
who
were
escorting
somebody
dressed
in
widow
weeds
in
another
second
there
was
a
cry
of
joy
and
a
sweet
pale
faced
little
lady
had
run
at
the
child
dick
and
was
hugging
him
against
her
heart
and
sobbing
and
laughing
both
at
once
oh
my
boy
my
boy
cried
lady
holmhurst
for
it
was
she
i
thought
you
were
dead
long
ago
dead
and
then
she
turned
and
before
all
the
people
there
clung
about
augusta
neck
and
kissed
her
and
blessed
her
because
she
had
saved
her
only
child
and
half
removed
the
deadweight
of
her
desolation
whereat
the
crowd
cheered
and
wept
and
yelled
and
swore
with
excitement
and
blessed
their
stars
that
they
were
there
to
see
and
then
in
a
haze
of
noise
and
excitement
they
were
led
through
the
cheering
mob
to
where
a
carriage
and
pair
were
standing
and
were
helped
into
it
thomas
being
placed
on
the
front
seat
and
lady
holmhurst
and
augusta
on
the
back
the
former
with
the
gasping
dick
upon
her
knee
and
now
little
dick
is
out
of
the
story
then
another
event
occurred
which
we
must
go
back
a
little
to
explain
when
eustace
meeson
had
come
to
town
after
being
formally
disinherited
he
had
managed
to
get
a
billet
as
latin
french
and
old
english
reader
in
a
publishing
house
of
repute
as
it
happened
on
this
very
afternoon
he
was
strolling
down
the
strand
having
finished
a
rather
stiff
work
and
with
a
mind
filled
with
those
idle
and
somewhat
confused
odds
and
ends
of
speculation
with
which
most
brain
workers
will
be
acquainted
he
looked
older
and
paler
than
when
we
last
met
him
for
sorrow
and
misfortune
had
laid
their
heavy
hands
upon
him
when
augusta
had
departed
he
had
discovered
that
he
was
head
over
heels
in
love
with
her
in
that
unfortunate
way
for
times
out
of
a
hundred
it
is
unfortunate
in
which
many
men
of
susceptibility
do
occasionally
fall
in
love
in
their
youth
a
way
that
brands
the
heart
for
life
in
a
fashion
that
can
no
more
be
effaced
than
the
stamp
of
a
hot
iron
can
be
effaced
from
the
physical
body
such
an
affection
which
is
not
altogether
of
the
earth
will
when
it
overcomes
a
man
prove
either
the
greatest
blessing
of
his
life
or
one
of
the
heaviest
most
enduring
curses
that
a
malignant
fate
can
heap
upon
his
head
for
if
he
achieves
his
desire
even
though
he
serve
his
seven
years
surely
for
him
life
will
be
robbed
of
half
its
evil
but
if
he
lose
her
either
through
misfortune
or
because
he
gave
all
this
to
one
who
did
not
understand
the
gift
or
one
who
looked
at
love
and
on
herself
as
a
currency
wherewith
to
buy
her
place
and
the
luxury
of
days
then
he
will
be
of
all
men
among
the
most
miserable
for
nothing
can
give
him
back
that
which
has
gone
from
him
eustace
had
never
seen
augusta
but
twice
in
his
life
but
then
passion
does
not
necessarily
depend
upon
constant
previous
intercourse
with
its
object
love
at
first
sight
is
common
enough
and
in
this
instance
eustace
was
not
altogether
dependent
upon
the
spoken
words
of
his
adored
or
on
his
recollection
of
her
very
palpable
beauty
for
he
had
her
books
to
those
who
know
something
of
the
writer
sufficient
let
us
say
to
enable
him
to
put
an
approximate
value
on
his
or
her
sentiments
so
as
to
form
a
more
or
less
accurate
guess
as
to
when
he
is
speaking
from
his
own
mind
when
he
is
speaking
from
the
mind
of
the
puppet
in
hand
and
when
he
is
merely
putting
a
case
a
person
books
are
full
of
information
and
bring
that
person
into
a
closer
and
more
intimate
contact
with
the
reader
than
any
amount
of
personal
intercourse
for
whatever
is
best
and
whatever
is
worst
in
an
individual
will
be
reflected
in
his
pages
seeing
that
unless
he
is
the
poorest
of
hack
authors
he
must
of
necessity
set
down
therein
the
images
that
pass
across
the
mirrors
of
his
heart
thus
it
seemed
to
eustace
who
knew
jemima
vow
and
also
her
previous
abortive
work
almost
by
heart
that
he
was
very
intimately
acquainted
with
augusta
and
as
he
was
walking
home
that
may
evening
he
was
reflecting
sadly
enough
of
all
that
he
had
lost
through
that
cruel
shipwreck
he
had
lost
augusta
and
what
was
more
he
had
lost
his
uncle
and
his
uncle
vast
fortune
for
he
too
had
seen
the
report
of
the
application
re
meeson
in
the
and
though
he
knew
that
he
was
disinherited
it
was
a
little
crushing
he
had
lost
the
fortune
for
augusta
sake
and
now
he
had
lost
augusta
also
and
he
reflected
not
without
dismay
on
the
long
dreary
existence
that
stretched
away
before
him
filled
up
as
it
were
with
prospective
piles
of
latin
proofs
with
a
sigh
he
halted
at
the
crossing
in
the
strand
which
owing
to
the
constant
stream
of
traffic
at
this
point
is
one
of
the
worst
in
london
there
was
a
block
at
the
moment
as
there
generally
is
and
he
stood
for
some
minutes
watching
the
frantic
dashes
of
an
old
woman
who
always
tried
to
cross
it
at
the
wrong
time
not
without
some
amusement
presently
however
a
boy
with
a
bundle
of
unfolded
under
his
arm
came
rushing
along
making
the
place
hideous
with
his
howls
wonderful
escape
of
a
lady
and
han
infant
he
roared
account
of
the
survivors
of
the
kangaroo
wonderful
escape
desert
island
arrival
of
the
magnolia
with
the
criminals
eustace
jumped
and
instantly
bought
a
copy
of
the
paper
stepping
into
the
doorway
of
a
shop
where
they
sold
masonic
jewels
of
every
size
and
hue
in
order
to
read
it
the
very
first
thing
that
his
eye
fell
on
was
an
editorial
paragraph
in
another
column
ran
the
paragraph
will
be
found
a
short
account
telegraphed
to
us
from
southampton
just
as
we
are
going
to
press
of
the
most
remarkable
tale
of
the
sea
that
we
are
acquainted
with
the
escape
of
miss
augusta
smithers
and
of
the
little
lord
holmhurst
as
we
suppose
that
we
must
now
call
him
from
the
kangaroo
and
their
subsequent
rescue
on
kerguelen
land
by
the
american
whaler
will
certainly
take
rank
as
the
most
romantic
incident
of
its
kind
in
the
recent
annals
of
shipwreck
miss
smithers
who
will
be
better
known
to
the
public
as
the
authoress
of
that
charming
book
vow
which
took
the
town
by
storm
about
a
year
ago
will
arrive
at
waterloo
station
by
the
train
and
we
shall
then
eustace
read
no
more
sick
and
faint
with
an
extraordinary
revulsion
of
feeling
he
leant
against
the
door
of
the
masonic
shop
which
promptly
opened
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
depositing
him
upon
his
back
on
the
floor
of
the
establishment
in
a
second
he
was
up
and
had
bounded
out
of
the
shop
with
such
energy
that
the
shopman
was
on
the
point
of
holloaing
stop
thief
it
was
exactly
five
and
he
was
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
from
waterloo
station
a
hansom
was
sauntering
along
in
front
of
him
he
sprang
into
it
waterloo
main
line
he
shouted
as
hard
as
you
can
go
and
in
another
moment
he
was
rolling
across
the
bridge
five
or
six
minutes
drive
brought
him
to
the
station
to
which
an
enormous
number
of
people
were
hurrying
collected
together
partly
by
a
rumour
of
what
was
going
on
and
partly
by
that
magnetic
contagion
of
excitement
which
runs
through
a
london
mob
like
fire
through
dry
grass
he
dismissed
the
hansom
throwing
the
driver
which
considering
that
were
none
too
plentiful
with
him
was
a
rash
thing
to
do
and
vigorously
shouldered
his
way
through
the
crush
till
he
reached
the
spot
where
the
carriage
and
pair
were
standing
the
carriage
was
just
beginning
to
move
on
stop
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
to
the
coachman
who
pulled
up
again
in
another
moment
he
was
alongside
and
there
sweeter
and
more
beautiful
than
in
ever
he
once
more
saw
his
love
she
started
at
his
voice
which
she
seemed
to
know
and
their
eyes
met
their
eyes
met
and
a
great
light
of
happiness
shot
into
her
sweet
face
and
shone
there
till
it
was
covered
up
and
lost
in
the
warm
blush
that
followed
he
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
twice
he
tried
and
twice
he
failed
and
meanwhile
the
mob
shouted
like
anything
at
last
however
he
got
it
out
thank
god
he
stammered
thank
god
you
are
safe
for
answer
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
gave
him
one
sweet
look
he
took
it
and
once
more
the
carriage
began
to
move
on
where
are
you
to
be
found
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
ask
at
lady
holmhurst
come
morning
i
have
something
to
tell
you
she
answered
and
in
another
minute
the
carriage
was
gone
leaving
him
standing
there
in
a
condition
of
mind
which
really
can
be
better
imagined
than
described
chapter
xiv
at
eustace
could
never
quite
remember
how
he
got
through
the
evening
of
that
eventful
day
everything
connected
with
it
seemed
hazy
to
him
as
however
fortunately
for
the
reader
of
this
history
we
are
not
altogether
dependent
on
the
memory
of
a
young
man
in
love
which
is
always
a
treacherous
thing
to
deal
with
having
other
and
exclusive
sources
of
information
we
may
as
well
fill
the
gap
first
of
all
he
went
to
his
club
and
seized
a
in
which
he
discovered
that
lord
holmhurst
or
rather
lady
holmhurst
london
house
was
in
then
he
walked
to
his
rooms
in
one
of
the
little
opening
out
of
the
strand
and
went
through
the
form
of
eating
some
dinner
after
which
a
terrible
fit
of
restlessness
got
possession
of
him
and
he
started
out
walking
for
three
solid
hours
did
that
young
man
walk
which
was
no
doubt
a
good
thing
for
him
for
one
never
gets
enough
exercise
in
london
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
having
already
been
to
hammersmith
and
back
he
found
himself
gravitating
towards
once
there
he
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
number
there
was
a
light
in
the
floor
and
the
night
being
warm
one
of
the
windows
was
open
so
that
the
shone
softly
through
the
lace
curtains
eustace
crossed
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
leaning
against
the
iron
railings
of
the
square
looked
up
he
was
rewarded
for
his
pains
for
through
the
filmy
curtain
he
could
make
out
the
forms
of
two
ladies
seated
side
by
side
upon
an
ottoman
with
their
faces
towards
the
window
and
in
one
of
these
he
had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
augusta
her
head
was
leaning
on
her
hand
and
she
was
talking
earnestly
to
her
companion
he
wondered
what
she
was
talking
of
and
had
half
a
mind
to
go
and
ring
and
ask
to
see
her
why
should
he
wait
till
morning
presently
however
better
counsels
prevailed
and
though
sorely
against
his
will
he
stopped
where
he
was
till
a
policeman
thinking
his
rapt
gaze
suspicious
gruffly
requested
him
to
move
on
to
gaze
at
one
only
love
through
an
open
window
is
no
doubt
a
delightful
occupation
if
a
somewhat
tantalising
one
but
if
ears
had
been
as
good
as
his
eyes
and
he
could
have
heard
the
conversation
that
was
proceeding
in
the
he
would
have
been
still
more
interested
augusta
had
just
been
unfolding
that
part
of
her
story
which
dealt
with
the
important
document
tattooed
upon
her
shoulders
to
which
lady
holmhurst
had
listened
ore
rotundo
and
so
the
young
man
is
coming
here
morning
said
lady
holmhurst
how
delightful
i
am
sure
he
looked
a
very
nice
young
man
and
he
had
very
fine
eyes
it
is
the
most
romantic
thing
that
i
ever
heard
of
it
may
be
delightful
for
you
bessie
said
augusta
rather
tartly
but
i
call
it
disgusting
it
is
all
very
well
to
be
tattooed
upon
a
desert
island
not
that
that
was
very
nice
i
can
tell
you
but
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
have
to
show
the
results
in
a
london
of
course
meeson
will
want
to
see
this
will
whatever
it
may
be
worth
and
i
should
like
to
ask
you
bessie
how
i
am
to
show
it
to
him
it
is
on
my
neck
i
have
not
observed
said
lady
holmhurst
drily
that
ladies
as
a
rule
have
an
insuperable
objection
to
showing
their
necks
if
you
have
any
doubt
on
the
point
i
recommend
you
to
get
an
invitation
to
a
london
ball
all
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
wear
a
low
dress
the
fact
of
being
tattooed
does
not
make
it
any
more
improper
for
you
to
show
your
shoulders
than
it
would
be
if
they
were
not
tattooed
i
have
never
worn
a
low
dress
said
augusta
and
i
do
not
want
to
show
my
shoulders
ah
well
said
lady
holmhurst
darkly
i
daresay
that
that
feeling
will
soon
wear
off
but
of
course
if
you
wo
you
wo
and
under
those
circumstances
you
had
better
say
nothing
about
the
will
though
she
added
learnedly
of
course
that
would
be
compounding
a
felony
would
it
i
do
quite
see
where
the
felony
comes
in
well
of
course
it
is
this
way
you
steal
the
will
that
felony
and
if
you
do
show
it
to
him
i
suppose
you
compound
it
it
is
a
double
offence
compound
felony
nonsense
answered
augusta
to
this
exposition
of
the
law
which
was
it
will
be
admitted
almost
as
lucid
and
convincing
as
that
of
an
average
how
can
i
steal
my
own
shoulders
it
is
impossible
oh
no
not
at
all
you
do
know
what
funny
things
you
can
do
i
once
had
a
cousin
whom
i
coached
for
his
examination
for
the
bar
and
i
learnt
a
great
deal
about
it
then
poor
fellow
he
was
plucked
eight
times
i
am
sure
i
do
wonder
at
it
said
augusta
rudely
well
i
suppose
i
must
put
on
this
low
dress
but
it
is
horrid
perfectly
horrid
you
will
have
to
lend
me
one
that
is
all
my
dear
answered
lady
holmhurst
with
a
glance
at
her
widow
weeds
i
have
no
low
dresses
though
perhaps
i
can
find
some
among
the
things
i
put
away
before
we
sailed
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
augusta
took
her
hand
and
they
began
to
talk
of
that
great
bereavement
and
of
their
own
wonderful
survival
till
at
last
she
led
the
conversation
round
to
little
dick
and
bessie
holmhurst
smiled
again
at
the
thought
that
her
darling
boy
her
only
child
was
safe
asleep
up
stairs
and
not
as
she
had
believed
washing
to
and
fro
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
she
took
augusta
hand
and
kissed
it
and
blessed
her
for
having
saved
her
child
till
suddenly
somewhat
to
the
relief
of
the
latter
the
butler
opened
the
door
and
said
that
two
gentlemen
wanted
very
particularly
to
speak
to
miss
smithers
and
then
she
was
once
more
handed
over
to
her
old
enemies
the
interviewers
and
after
them
came
the
representatives
of
the
company
and
then
more
special
reporters
and
then
an
artist
from
one
of
the
illustrated
papers
who
insisted
upon
her
giving
him
an
appointment
in
language
that
though
polite
indicated
that
he
meant
to
have
his
way
and
so
on
till
nearly
midnight
when
she
rushed
off
to
bed
and
locked
her
door
next
morning
augusta
appeared
at
breakfast
dressed
in
an
exceedingly
becoming
low
dress
which
lady
holmhurst
sent
up
to
her
with
her
hot
water
she
had
never
worn
one
before
and
it
certainly
is
trying
to
put
on
a
low
dress
for
the
first
time
in
full
daylight
indeed
she
felt
as
guilty
as
does
a
person
of
temperate
habits
when
he
is
persuaded
to
drink
a
brandy
and
soda
before
getting
up
however
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
throwing
a
shawl
over
her
shoulders
she
descended
my
dear
do
let
me
see
said
lady
holmhurst
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
left
the
room
with
a
sigh
augusta
uncovered
her
shoulders
and
her
friend
ran
round
the
table
to
look
at
them
there
on
her
neck
was
the
will
the
cuttle
ink
had
proved
an
excellent
medium
and
the
tattooing
was
as
fresh
as
the
day
on
which
it
had
been
done
and
would
no
doubt
remain
so
till
the
last
hour
of
her
life
well
said
lady
holmhurst
i
hope
the
young
man
will
be
duly
grateful
i
should
have
to
be
very
much
in
love
and
she
looked
meaningly
at
augusta
before
i
would
spoil
myself
in
that
fashion
for
any
man
augusta
blushed
at
the
insinuation
and
said
nothing
at
ten
just
as
they
were
half
through
breakfast
there
came
a
ring
at
the
bell
here
he
is
said
lady
holmhurst
clapping
her
hands
well
if
this
is
the
very
funniest
thing
that
i
ever
heard
of
i
told
jones
to
show
him
in
here
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
when
the
butler
who
looked
as
solemn
as
a
mute
in
his
deep
mourning
opened
the
door
and
announced
eustace
meeson
in
those
deep
and
commanding
tones
which
flunkeys
and
flunkeys
alone
have
at
their
command
there
was
a
moment
pause
augusta
half
rose
from
her
chair
and
then
sat
down
again
and
noticing
her
embarrassment
lady
holmhurst
smiled
maliciously
then
came
in
eustace
himself
looking
rather
handsome
exceedingly
nervous
and
beautifully
got
up
in
a
with
a
flower
in
it
oh
how
do
you
do
he
said
to
augusta
holding
out
his
hand
which
she
took
rather
coldly
how
do
you
do
meeson
she
answered
let
me
introduce
you
to
lady
holmhurst
meeson
lady
holmhurst
eustace
bowed
and
put
his
hat
down
on
the
for
he
was
very
much
overcome
i
hope
that
i
have
not
come
too
early
he
said
in
great
confusion
as
he
perceived
his
mistake
i
thought
that
you
would
have
done
breakfast
oh
not
at
all
meeson
said
lady
holmhurst
wo
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
augusta
give
meeson
a
cup
of
tea
he
took
the
tea
which
he
did
not
want
in
the
least
and
then
there
came
an
awkward
silence
nobody
seemed
to
know
how
to
begin
the
conversation
how
did
you
find
the
house
mr
meeson
said
lady
holmhurst
at
last
miss
smithers
gave
you
no
address
and
there
are
two
lady
holmhursts
my
and
myself
oh
i
looked
it
out
and
then
i
walked
here
last
night
and
saw
you
both
sitting
at
the
window
indeed
said
lady
holmhurst
and
why
did
you
not
come
in
you
might
have
helped
to
protect
miss
smithers
from
the
reporters
i
do
know
he
answered
confusedly
i
did
not
like
to
and
besides
a
policeman
thought
i
was
a
suspicious
character
and
told
me
to
move
on
dear
me
meeson
you
must
have
been
having
a
good
look
at
us
here
augusta
interposed
fearing
least
her
admirer
for
with
an
unerring
instinct
she
now
guessed
how
matters
stood
should
say
something
foolish
a
young
man
who
is
capable
of
standing
to
stare
at
a
house
in
is
she
thought
evidently
capable
of
anything
i
was
surprised
to
see
you
yesterday
she
said
how
did
you
know
we
were
coming
eustace
told
her
that
he
had
seen
it
in
the
i
am
sure
you
can
not
have
been
so
surprised
as
i
was
he
went
on
i
had
made
sure
that
you
were
drowned
i
went
up
to
birmingham
to
call
on
you
after
you
had
gone
and
found
that
you
had
vanished
and
left
no
address
the
declared
that
you
had
sailed
in
a
ship
called
the
eel
which
i
afterwards
found
out
was
kangaroo
and
then
she
went
down
and
after
a
long
time
they
published
a
full
list
of
the
passengers
and
your
name
was
not
among
them
and
i
thought
that
after
all
you
might
have
got
off
the
ship
or
something
then
some
days
afterwards
came
a
telegram
from
albany
in
australia
giving
the
names
of
lady
holmhurst
and
the
others
who
were
saved
and
specially
mentioning
smithers
the
novelist
and
lord
holmhurst
as
being
among
the
drowned
and
that
is
how
the
dreadful
suspense
came
to
an
end
it
was
awful
i
can
tell
you
both
of
the
young
women
looked
at
eustace
face
and
saw
that
there
was
no
mistaking
the
real
nature
of
the
trial
through
which
he
had
passed
so
real
was
it
that
it
never
seemed
to
occur
to
him
that
there
was
anything
unusual
in
his
expressing
such
intense
interest
in
the
affairs
of
a
young
lady
with
whom
he
was
outwardly
at
any
rate
on
the
terms
of
merest
acquaintance
it
was
very
kind
of
you
to
think
so
much
about
me
said
augusta
gently
i
had
no
idea
that
you
would
call
again
or
i
would
have
left
word
where
i
was
going
well
thank
god
you
are
safe
and
sound
at
any
rate
answered
eustace
and
then
with
a
sudden
burst
of
anxiety
you
are
not
going
back
to
new
zealand
just
yet
are
you
i
do
know
i
am
rather
sick
of
the
sea
just
now
no
indeed
she
is
not
said
lady
holmhurst
she
is
going
to
stop
with
me
and
dick
miss
smithers
saved
dick
life
you
know
when
the
nurse
poor
thing
had
run
away
and
now
dear
you
had
better
tell
meeson
about
the
will
the
will
what
will
asked
eustace
listen
and
you
will
hear
and
eustace
did
listen
with
open
eyes
and
ears
while
augusta
getting
over
her
shyness
as
best
she
might
told
the
whole
story
of
his
uncle
death
and
of
the
way
in
which
he
had
communicated
his
testamentary
wishes
and
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
said
eustace
astounded
that
you
allowed
him
to
have
his
confounded
will
tattooed
upon
your
neck
yes
answered
augusta
i
did
and
what
is
more
meeson
i
think
that
you
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
me
for
i
daresay
that
i
shall
often
be
sorry
for
it
i
am
much
obliged
answered
eustace
i
had
no
right
to
expect
such
a
thing
and
in
short
i
do
not
know
what
to
say
i
should
never
have
thought
that
any
woman
was
capable
of
such
a
sacrifice
for
for
a
comparative
stranger
then
came
another
awkward
pause
well
meeson
said
augusta
at
last
rising
brusquely
from
her
chair
the
document
belongs
to
you
and
so
i
suppose
that
you
had
better
see
it
not
that
i
think
that
it
will
be
of
much
use
to
you
however
as
i
see
that
had
been
allowed
to
issue
whatever
that
may
mean
of
meeson
other
will
i
do
not
know
that
that
will
matter
said
eustace
as
i
heard
a
friend
of
mine
short
who
is
a
barrister
talk
about
some
case
the
other
day
in
which
probate
was
revoked
on
the
production
of
a
subsequent
will
indeed
answered
augusta
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
then
perhaps
after
all
i
have
been
tattooed
to
some
purpose
well
i
suppose
you
had
better
see
it
and
with
a
gesture
that
was
half
shy
and
half
defiant
she
drew
the
lace
shawl
from
her
shoulders
and
turned
her
back
towards
him
so
that
he
might
see
what
was
inscribed
across
it
eustace
stared
at
the
broad
line
of
letters
which
with
the
signatures
written
underneath
might
mean
a
matter
of
two
millions
of
money
to
him
thank
you
he
said
at
last
and
taking
up
the
lace
shawl
he
threw
it
over
her
again
if
you
will
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
meeson
interrupted
lady
holmhurst
at
this
point
i
have
to
go
to
see
about
the
dinner
and
before
augusta
could
interfere
she
had
left
the
room
eustace
closed
the
door
behind
her
and
turned
feeling
instinctively
that
a
great
crisis
in
his
fortunes
had
come
there
are
some
men
who
rise
to
an
emergency
and
some
who
shrink
from
it
and
the
difference
is
that
difference
between
him
who
succeeds
and
him
who
fails
in
life
and
in
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
eustace
belonged
to
the
class
that
rises
and
not
to
that
which
shrinks
chapter
xv
eustace
consults
a
lawyer
augusta
was
leaning
against
the
marble
mantelpiece
indeed
one
of
her
arms
was
resting
upon
it
for
she
was
a
tall
woman
perhaps
she
too
felt
that
there
was
something
in
the
air
at
any
rate
she
turned
away
her
head
and
began
to
play
with
a
bronze
japanese
lobster
which
adorned
the
mantelpiece
now
for
it
said
eustace
to
himself
drawing
a
long
breath
to
try
and
steady
the
violent
pulsations
of
his
heart
i
do
know
what
to
say
to
you
miss
smithers
he
began
best
say
nothing
more
about
it
she
put
in
quickly
i
did
it
and
i
am
glad
that
i
did
it
what
do
a
few
marks
matter
if
a
great
wrong
is
prevented
thereby
i
am
not
ever
likely
to
have
to
go
to
court
besides
meeson
there
is
another
thing
it
was
through
me
that
you
lost
your
inheritance
it
is
only
right
that
i
should
try
to
be
the
means
of
bringing
it
back
to
you
she
dropped
her
head
again
and
once
more
began
to
play
with
the
bronze
lobster
holding
her
arm
in
such
a
fashion
that
eustace
could
not
see
her
face
but
if
he
could
not
see
her
face
she
could
see
his
in
the
glass
and
narrowly
observed
its
every
change
which
on
the
whole
though
natural
was
rather
mean
of
her
poor
eustace
grew
pale
and
paler
yet
till
his
handsome
countenance
became
positively
ghastly
it
is
wonderful
how
frightened
young
men
are
the
first
time
that
they
propose
it
wears
off
afterwards
with
practice
one
gets
accustomed
to
anything
miss
smithers
augusta
he
gasped
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
and
he
stopped
dead
yes
meeson
she
answered
cheerfully
what
is
it
i
want
to
tell
you
and
again
he
hesitated
what
you
are
going
to
do
about
the
will
suggested
augusta
no
no
nothing
about
the
will
please
do
laugh
at
me
and
put
me
off
she
looked
up
innocently
as
much
as
to
say
that
she
never
dreamed
of
doing
either
of
these
things
she
had
a
lovely
face
and
the
glance
of
the
grey
eyes
quite
broke
down
the
barrier
of
his
fears
oh
augusta
augusta
he
said
do
you
understand
i
love
you
i
love
you
no
woman
was
ever
loved
before
as
i
love
you
i
fell
in
love
with
you
the
very
first
time
i
saw
you
in
the
office
at
meeson
when
i
had
the
row
with
my
uncle
about
you
and
ever
since
then
i
have
got
deeper
and
deeper
in
love
with
you
when
i
thought
that
you
were
drowned
it
nearly
broke
my
heart
and
often
and
often
i
wished
that
i
were
dead
too
it
was
augusta
turn
to
be
disturbed
now
for
though
a
lady
composure
will
stand
her
in
good
stead
up
to
the
very
verge
of
an
affair
of
this
sort
it
generally
breaks
down
medias
anyhow
she
certainly
dropped
her
eyes
and
colored
to
her
hair
while
her
breast
began
to
heave
tumultuously
do
you
know
meeson
she
said
at
last
without
daring
to
look
at
his
imploring
face
that
this
is
only
the
fourth
time
that
we
have
seen
each
other
including
yesterday
yes
i
know
he
said
but
do
refuse
me
on
that
account
you
can
see
me
as
often
as
you
like
this
was
generous
of
master
eustace
and
really
i
know
you
better
than
you
think
i
should
think
that
i
have
read
each
of
your
books
twenty
times
this
was
a
happy
stroke
for
however
free
from
vanity
a
person
may
be
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
young
woman
to
hear
that
somebody
has
read
her
book
twenty
times
without
being
pleased
i
am
not
my
books
said
augusta
no
but
your
books
are
part
of
you
he
answered
and
i
have
learnt
more
about
your
real
self
through
them
than
i
should
have
done
if
i
had
seen
you
a
hundred
times
instead
of
four
augusta
slowly
raised
her
grey
eyes
till
they
met
his
own
and
looked
at
him
as
though
she
were
searching
out
his
soul
and
the
memory
of
that
long
sweet
look
is
with
him
yet
he
said
no
more
nor
had
she
any
words
but
somehow
nearer
and
nearer
they
drew
one
to
the
other
till
his
arms
were
around
her
and
his
lips
were
pressed
upon
her
lips
happy
man
and
happy
girl
they
will
live
to
find
that
life
has
joys
for
those
who
are
good
and
are
well
off
but
that
it
has
no
joys
so
holy
and
so
complete
as
that
which
they
were
now
experiencing
the
first
kiss
of
true
and
honest
love
a
little
while
afterwards
the
butler
came
in
in
a
horribly
sudden
manner
and
found
augusta
and
eustace
the
one
very
red
and
the
other
very
pale
standing
suspiciously
close
to
each
other
but
he
was
a
very
butler
and
a
man
of
experience
who
had
seen
much
and
guessed
more
and
he
looked
innocent
as
a
babe
unborn
just
then
too
lady
holmhurst
came
in
again
and
looked
at
the
pair
of
them
with
an
amusing
twinkle
in
her
eye
lady
holmhurst
like
her
butler
was
also
a
person
of
experience
wo
you
come
into
the
drawing
room
she
said
and
they
did
looking
rather
sheepish
and
there
eustace
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
announcing
that
they
were
engaged
to
be
married
and
although
this
was
somewhat
of
an
assumption
seeing
that
no
actual
words
of
troth
had
passed
between
them
augusta
stood
there
never
offering
a
word
in
contradiction
well
meeson
said
lady
holmhurst
i
think
that
you
are
the
luckiest
man
of
my
acquaintance
for
augusta
is
not
only
one
of
the
sweetest
and
loveliest
girls
that
i
have
ever
met
she
is
also
the
bravest
and
the
cleverest
you
will
have
to
look
out
meeson
or
you
will
be
known
as
the
husband
of
the
great
augusta
meeson
i
will
take
the
risk
he
answered
humbly
i
know
that
augusta
has
more
brains
in
her
little
finger
than
i
have
in
my
whole
body
i
do
know
how
she
can
look
at
a
fellow
like
me
dear
me
how
humble
we
are
said
lady
holmhurst
well
that
is
the
way
of
men
before
marriage
and
now
as
augusta
carries
both
your
fortunes
on
her
back
as
well
as
in
her
face
and
brain
i
venture
to
suggest
that
you
had
better
go
and
see
a
lawyer
about
the
matter
that
is
if
you
have
quite
finished
your
little
talk
i
suppose
that
you
will
come
and
dine
with
us
meeson
and
if
you
like
to
come
a
little
early
say
six
i
daresay
that
augusta
will
arrange
to
be
in
to
hear
what
you
have
found
out
about
this
will
you
know
and
now
an
revoir
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
nice
young
man
my
dear
said
lady
holmhurst
as
soon
as
eustace
had
bowed
himself
out
it
was
rather
audacious
of
him
to
propose
to
you
the
fourth
time
that
he
set
eyes
upon
you
but
i
think
that
audacity
is
on
the
whole
a
good
quality
in
the
male
sex
another
thing
is
that
if
that
will
is
worth
anything
he
will
be
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
the
whole
of
england
so
taking
it
altogether
i
think
i
may
congratulate
you
my
dear
and
now
i
suppose
that
you
have
been
in
love
with
this
young
man
all
along
i
guessed
as
much
when
i
saw
your
face
as
he
ran
up
to
the
carriage
yesterday
and
i
was
sure
of
it
when
i
heard
about
the
tattooing
no
girl
would
allow
herself
to
be
tattooed
in
the
interest
of
abstract
justice
oh
yes
i
know
all
about
it
and
now
i
am
going
out
walking
in
the
park
with
dick
and
i
should
advise
you
to
compose
yourself
for
that
artist
is
coming
to
draw
you
at
twelve
and
she
departed
and
left
augusta
to
her
reflections
which
were
well
not
unpleasant
ones
meanwhile
eustace
was
marching
towards
the
temple
as
it
happened
in
the
same
where
he
had
been
living
for
the
last
few
months
two
brothers
of
the
name
of
short
had
rooms
and
with
these
young
gentlemen
he
had
become
very
friendly
the
two
shorts
were
twins
and
so
like
one
another
that
it
was
more
than
a
month
before
eustace
could
be
sure
which
of
them
he
was
speaking
to
when
they
were
both
at
college
their
father
died
leaving
his
property
equally
between
them
and
as
this
property
on
realisation
was
not
found
to
amount
to
more
than
four
hundred
a
year
the
twins
very
rightly
concluded
that
they
had
better
do
something
to
supplement
their
moderate
income
accordingly
by
a
stroke
of
genius
they
determined
that
one
of
them
should
become
a
solicitor
and
the
other
a
barrister
and
then
tossed
up
as
to
which
should
take
to
which
trade
the
idea
of
course
was
that
in
this
manner
they
would
be
able
to
afford
each
other
mutual
comfort
and
support
john
would
give
james
briefs
and
james
reflected
glory
would
shine
back
on
john
in
short
they
were
anxious
to
establish
a
legal
dong
firm
of
the
most
approved
pattern
accordingly
they
passed
their
respective
examinations
and
john
took
rooms
with
another
budding
solicitor
in
the
city
while
james
hired
chambers
in
but
there
the
matter
stopped
for
as
john
did
not
get
any
work
of
course
he
could
not
give
any
to
james
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
for
the
past
three
years
neither
of
the
twins
had
found
the
law
as
profitable
as
they
anticipated
in
vain
did
john
sit
and
sigh
in
the
city
clients
were
few
and
far
between
scarcely
enough
to
pay
his
rent
and
in
vain
did
james
artistically
robed
wander
like
the
evil
one
from
court
to
court
seeking
what
he
might
devour
occasionally
he
had
the
pleasure
of
taking
a
note
for
another
barrister
who
was
called
away
which
means
doing
another
man
work
for
nothing
once
too
a
man
with
whom
he
had
a
nodding
acquaintance
rushed
up
to
him
and
thrusting
a
brief
into
his
hands
asked
him
to
hold
it
for
him
telling
him
that
it
would
be
on
in
a
short
time
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
nothing
at
all
scarcely
had
poor
james
struggled
through
the
brief
when
the
case
was
called
on
and
it
may
suffice
to
say
that
at
its
conclusion
the
judge
gazed
at
him
mildly
over
his
spectacles
and
could
not
help
wondering
that
any
learned
counsel
had
been
found
who
would
consent
to
waste
the
time
of
the
court
in
such
a
case
as
the
one
to
which
he
had
been
listening
clearly
james
friend
would
not
so
consent
and
had
passed
on
the
responsibility
minus
the
fee
on
another
occasion
james
was
in
the
probate
court
on
motion
day
and
a
solicitor
a
real
live
solicitor
came
up
to
him
and
asked
him
to
make
a
motion
marked
gns
for
leave
to
dispense
with
a
this
motion
he
made
and
the
was
dispensed
with
in
the
approved
fashion
but
when
he
turned
round
the
solicitor
had
vanished
and
he
never
saw
him
more
or
the
two
guineas
either
however
the
brief
his
only
one
remained
and
after
that
he
took
to
hovering
about
the
divorce
court
partly
in
the
hope
of
once
more
seeing
that
solicitor
and
partly
with
a
vague
idea
of
drifting
into
practice
in
the
division
now
eustace
had
often
when
in
the
shorts
in
the
in
the
strand
heard
the
barrister
james
hold
forth
learnedly
on
the
matter
of
wills
and
therefore
he
naturally
enough
turned
towards
him
in
his
recent
dilemma
knowing
the
address
of
his
chambers
in
he
hurried
thither
and
was
in
due
course
admitted
by
a
very
small
child
who
apparently
filled
the
responsible
office
of
clerk
to
james
short
and
several
other
learned
gentlemen
whose
names
appeared
upon
the
door
the
infant
regarded
eustace
when
he
opened
the
door
with
a
look
of
such
preternatural
sharpness
that
it
almost
frightened
him
the
beginning
of
that
eagle
glance
was
full
of
inquiring
hope
and
the
end
of
resigned
despair
the
child
had
thought
that
eustace
might
be
a
client
come
to
tread
the
paths
which
no
client
ever
had
trod
hence
the
hope
and
the
despair
in
his
eyes
eustace
had
nothing
of
the
solicitor
clerk
about
him
clearly
he
was
not
a
client
short
was
in
that
door
to
the
right
eustace
knocked
and
entered
into
a
bare
little
chamber
about
the
size
of
a
large
housemaid
closet
furnished
with
a
table
three
chairs
one
a
basket
easy
and
a
with
a
couple
of
dozen
of
law
books
and
some
old
volumes
of
reports
and
a
broad
in
the
exact
centre
of
which
lay
the
solitary
and
venerated
brief
james
short
was
a
short
stout
young
man
with
black
eyes
a
hooked
nose
and
a
prematurely
bald
head
indeed
this
baldness
of
the
head
was
the
only
distinguishing
mark
between
james
and
john
and
therefore
a
thing
to
be
thankful
for
though
of
course
useless
to
the
perplexed
acquaintance
who
met
them
in
the
street
when
their
hats
were
on
at
the
moment
of
eustace
entry
short
had
been
engaged
in
studying
that
intensely
legal
print
the
which
however
from
some
unexplained
bashfulness
he
had
hastily
thrown
under
the
table
filling
its
space
with
a
law
book
snatched
at
hazard
from
the
shelf
all
right
old
fellow
said
eustace
whose
quick
eyes
had
caught
the
quick
flutter
of
the
vanishing
paper
do
be
alarmed
it
only
me
ah
said
james
short
when
he
had
shaken
hands
with
him
you
see
i
thought
that
it
might
have
been
a
client
a
client
is
always
possible
however
improbable
and
one
has
to
be
ready
to
meet
the
possibility
quite
so
old
fellow
said
eustace
but
do
you
know
as
it
happens
i
am
a
client
and
a
big
one
too
it
is
a
matter
of
two
millions
of
money
my
uncle
fortune
there
was
another
will
and
i
want
to
take
your
advice
short
fairly
bounded
out
of
the
chair
in
exultation
and
then
struck
by
another
thought
sank
back
into
it
again
my
dear
meeson
he
said
i
am
sorry
i
can
not
hear
you
eh
said
eustace
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
are
not
accompanied
by
a
solicitor
and
it
is
not
the
etiquette
of
the
profession
to
which
i
belong
to
see
a
client
unaccompanied
by
a
solicitor
oh
hang
the
etiquette
of
the
profession
my
dear
meeson
if
you
came
to
me
as
a
friend
i
should
be
happy
to
give
you
any
legal
information
in
my
power
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
know
something
of
matters
connected
with
probate
but
you
yourself
said
that
you
have
come
as
a
client
and
in
that
case
the
personal
relationship
sinks
into
the
background
and
is
superseded
by
the
official
relationship
under
these
circumstances
it
is
evident
that
the
etiquette
of
the
profession
intervenes
which
overmastering
force
compels
me
to
point
out
to
you
how
improper
and
contrary
to
precedent
it
would
be
for
me
to
listen
to
you
without
the
presence
of
a
properly
qualified
solicitor
oh
lord
gasped
eustace
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
so
particular
i
thought
perhaps
that
you
would
be
glad
of
the
job
certainly
certainly
in
the
present
state
of
my
practice
as
he
glanced
at
the
solitary
brief
i
should
be
the
last
to
wish
to
turn
away
work
let
me
suggest
that
you
should
go
and
consult
my
brother
john
in
the
poultry
i
believe
business
is
rather
slack
with
him
just
now
so
i
think
it
probable
that
you
will
find
him
disengaged
indeed
i
dare
say
that
i
may
go
so
far
as
to
make
an
appointment
for
him
here
let
us
say
in
an
hour
time
stop
i
will
consult
my
clerk
dick
the
infant
appeared
i
believe
that
i
have
no
appointment
for
this
morning
no
sir
said
dick
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
one
moment
sir
i
will
consult
the
book
and
he
vanished
to
return
presently
with
the
information
that
short
time
was
not
under
any
contributions
that
day
very
good
said
short
then
make
an
entry
of
an
appointment
with
john
short
and
meeson
at
two
precisely
yes
sir
said
dick
departing
to
the
unaccustomed
task
as
soon
as
eustace
had
departed
from
tweedledum
to
tweedledee
or
in
other
words
from
james
barrister
to
john
solicitor
dick
was
again
summoned
and
bade
go
to
a
certain
thomson
on
the
next
floor
thomson
had
an
excellent
library
which
had
come
to
him
by
will
on
the
strength
of
this
bequest
he
had
become
a
and
the
object
of
dick
visit
was
to
request
the
loan
of
the
eighth
volume
of
the
statutes
revised
containing
the
wills
act
of
cap
brown
on
probate
dixon
on
probate
and
powles
on
brown
to
the
study
of
which
valuable
books
james
short
devoted
himself
earnestly
whilst
awaiting
his
client
return
meanwhile
eustace
had
made
his
way
in
a
to
one
of
those
busy
courts
in
the
city
where
john
short
practised
as
a
solicitor
short
office
was
eustace
discovered
by
referring
to
a
notice
board
on
the
seventh
floor
of
one
of
the
tallest
houses
he
had
ever
seen
however
up
he
went
with
a
stout
heart
and
after
some
five
minutes
of
a
struggle
that
reminded
him
forcibly
of
climbing
the
ladders
of
a
cornish
mine
he
arrived
at
a
little
door
right
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
on
which
was
painted
john
short
solicitor
eustace
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
by
a
small
boy
so
like
the
small
boy
he
had
seen
at
james
short
at
the
temple
that
he
fairly
started
afterwards
the
mystery
was
explained
like
their
masters
the
two
small
boys
were
brothers
john
short
was
within
and
eustace
was
ushered
into
his
presence
to
all
appearance
he
was
consulting
a
voluminous
mass
of
correspondence
written
on
large
sheets
of
brief
paper
but
when
he
looked
at
it
closely
it
seemed
to
eustace
that
the
edges
of
the
paper
were
very
yellow
and
the
ink
was
much
faded
this
however
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
seeing
that
john
short
had
taken
them
over
with
the
other
fixtures
of
the
office
chapter
xvi
short
on
legal
etiquette
well
meeson
what
is
it
have
you
come
to
ask
me
to
lunch
asked
john
short
do
you
know
i
actually
thought
that
you
might
have
been
a
client
well
by
jove
old
fellow
and
so
i
am
answered
eustace
i
have
been
to
your
brother
and
he
has
sent
me
on
to
you
because
he
says
that
it
is
not
the
etiquette
of
the
profession
to
see
a
client
unless
a
solicitor
is
present
so
he
has
referred
me
to
you
perfectly
right
perfectly
right
of
my
brother
james
meeson
considering
how
small
are
his
opportunities
of
becoming
cognizant
with
the
practice
of
his
profession
it
is
extraordinary
how
well
he
is
acquainted
with
its
theory
and
now
what
is
the
point
well
do
you
know
short
as
the
point
is
rather
a
long
one
and
as
your
brother
said
that
he
should
expect
us
at
two
precisely
i
think
that
we
had
better
take
the
back
to
the
temple
when
i
can
tell
the
yarn
to
both
of
you
at
once
very
well
i
do
not
as
a
general
rule
like
leaving
my
office
at
this
time
of
day
as
it
is
apt
to
put
clients
to
inconvenience
especially
such
of
them
as
come
from
a
distance
but
i
will
make
an
exception
for
you
meeson
william
he
went
on
to
the
counterpart
of
the
infant
if
anyone
calls
to
see
me
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
them
that
i
am
engaged
in
an
important
conference
at
the
chambers
of
short
in
but
that
i
hope
to
be
back
by
three
yes
sir
said
william
as
he
shut
the
door
behind
them
certainly
sir
and
then
having
placed
the
musty
documents
upon
the
shelf
whence
they
could
be
fetched
down
without
difficulty
on
the
slightest
sign
of
a
client
that
ingenious
youth
with
singular
confidence
that
nobody
would
be
inconvenienced
thereby
put
a
notice
on
the
door
to
the
effect
that
he
would
be
back
immediately
and
adjourned
to
indulge
in
the
passionately
exhilarating
game
of
chuck
farthing
with
various
other
small
clerks
of
his
acquaintance
in
due
course
eustace
and
his
legal
adviser
arrived
at
and
oh
how
the
heart
of
james
the
barrister
swelled
with
pride
when
for
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
saw
a
real
solicitor
enter
his
chambers
accompanied
by
a
real
client
he
would
indeed
have
preferred
it
if
the
solicitor
had
not
happened
to
be
his
and
the
client
had
been
some
other
than
his
intimate
friend
but
still
it
was
a
blessed
sight
a
sight
will
you
be
seated
gentlemen
he
said
with
much
dignity
they
obeyed
and
now
meeson
i
suppose
that
you
have
explained
to
my
brother
the
matter
on
which
you
require
my
advice
no
i
have
said
eustace
i
thought
i
might
as
well
explain
it
to
you
both
together
eh
hum
said
james
it
is
not
quite
regular
according
to
the
etiquette
of
the
profession
to
which
i
have
the
honour
to
belong
it
is
not
customary
that
matters
should
be
so
dealt
with
it
is
usual
that
papers
should
be
presented
but
that
i
will
overlook
as
the
point
appears
to
be
pressing
that
right
said
eustace
well
i
have
come
to
see
about
a
will
so
i
understand
said
james
but
what
will
and
where
is
it
well
it
a
will
in
my
favour
and
is
tattooed
upon
a
lady
neck
the
twins
simultaneously
rose
from
their
chairs
and
looked
at
eustace
with
such
a
ridiculous
identity
of
movement
and
expression
that
he
fairly
burst
out
laughing
i
presume
meeson
that
this
is
not
a
hoax
said
james
severely
i
presume
that
you
know
too
well
what
is
due
to
learned
counsel
to
attempt
to
make
one
of
their
body
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
surely
meeson
added
john
you
have
sufficient
respect
for
the
dignity
of
the
law
not
to
tamper
with
it
in
any
such
way
as
my
brother
has
indicated
oh
certainly
not
i
assure
you
it
is
all
square
it
is
a
true
bill
or
rather
a
true
will
proceed
said
james
resuming
his
seat
this
is
evidently
a
case
of
an
unusual
nature
you
are
right
there
old
boy
said
eustace
and
now
just
listen
and
he
proceeded
to
unfold
his
moving
tale
with
much
point
and
emphasis
when
he
had
finished
john
looked
at
james
rather
helplessly
the
case
was
beyond
him
but
james
was
equal
to
the
occasion
he
had
mastered
that
first
great
axiom
which
every
young
barrister
should
lay
to
heart
never
appear
to
be
ignorant
this
case
he
said
as
though
he
were
giving
judgment
is
doubtless
of
a
remarkable
nature
and
i
can
not
at
the
moment
lay
my
hand
upon
any
authority
bearing
on
the
point
if
indeed
any
such
are
to
be
found
but
i
speak
and
must
not
be
held
too
closely
to
the
of
a
opinion
it
seems
to
me
that
notwithstanding
its
peculiar
idiosyncrasies
and
the
various
that
it
presents
it
will
upon
closer
examination
be
found
to
fall
within
those
general
laws
that
govern
the
legal
course
of
testamentary
disposition
if
i
remember
aright
i
speak
the
act
of
cap
specifies
that
a
will
shall
be
in
writing
and
tattooing
may
fairly
be
defined
as
a
rude
variety
of
writing
it
is
i
admit
usual
that
writing
should
be
done
on
paper
or
parchment
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
young
lady
skin
if
carefully
removed
and
dried
would
make
excellent
parchment
at
present
therefore
it
is
parchment
in
its
green
stage
and
perfectly
available
for
writing
purposes
to
continue
it
appears
i
am
taking
meeson
statement
as
being
perfectly
accurate
that
the
will
was
properly
and
duly
executed
by
the
testator
or
rather
by
the
person
who
tattooed
in
his
presence
and
at
his
command
a
form
of
signature
which
is
very
well
covered
by
the
section
of
the
act
of
cap
it
seems
too
that
the
witnesses
attested
in
the
presence
of
each
other
and
of
the
testator
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
attestation
clause
but
the
supposed
necessity
for
an
attestation
clause
is
one
of
those
fallacies
of
the
lay
mind
which
perhaps
cluster
more
frequently
and
with
a
greater
persistence
round
questions
connected
with
testamentary
disposition
than
those
of
any
other
branch
of
the
law
therefore
we
must
take
the
will
to
have
been
properly
executed
in
accordance
with
the
spirit
of
the
statute
and
now
we
come
to
what
at
present
strikes
me
as
the
crux
the
will
is
undated
does
that
invalidate
it
i
answer
with
confidence
no
and
mark
evidence
that
of
lady
holmhurst
can
be
produced
that
this
will
did
not
exist
upon
miss
augusta
smithers
previous
to
on
which
day
the
kangaroo
sank
and
evidence
can
also
be
produced
that
of
thomas
that
it
did
exist
on
christmas
day
when
miss
smithers
was
rescued
it
is
therefore
clear
that
it
must
have
got
upon
her
back
between
and
dec
quite
so
old
fellow
said
eustace
much
impressed
at
this
coruscation
of
legal
lore
evidently
you
are
the
man
to
tackle
the
case
but
i
say
what
is
to
be
done
next
you
see
i
afraid
it
too
late
probate
has
issued
whatever
that
may
mean
probate
has
issued
echoed
the
great
james
struggling
with
his
rising
contempt
and
is
the
law
so
helpless
that
probate
which
has
been
allowed
to
issue
under
an
erroneous
apprehension
of
the
facts
can
not
be
recalled
most
certainly
not
so
soon
as
the
preliminary
formalities
are
concluded
a
writ
must
be
issued
to
revoke
the
probate
and
claiming
that
the
court
should
pronounce
in
favour
of
the
later
will
or
stay
there
is
no
executor
there
is
no
executor
a
very
important
point
claiming
a
grant
of
letters
of
administration
with
the
will
annexed
i
think
that
will
be
the
better
course
but
how
can
you
annex
miss
smithers
to
a
of
letters
of
administration
whatever
that
may
mean
said
eustace
feebly
that
reminds
me
said
james
disregarding
the
question
and
addressing
his
brother
you
must
at
once
file
miss
smithers
in
the
registry
and
see
to
the
preparation
of
the
usual
affidavit
of
scripts
certainly
certainly
said
john
as
though
this
were
the
most
simple
business
in
the
world
what
gasped
eustace
as
a
vision
of
augusta
impaled
upon
an
enormous
rose
before
his
eyes
you
ca
file
a
lady
impossible
impossible
or
not
it
must
be
done
before
any
further
steps
are
taken
let
me
see
i
believe
that
probate
is
the
sitting
registrar
at
somerset
house
this
sittings
it
would
be
well
if
you
made
an
appointment
for
yes
said
john
well
went
on
james
i
think
that
is
all
for
the
present
you
will
of
course
let
me
have
the
instructions
and
other
papers
with
all
possible
speed
i
suppose
that
other
counsel
besides
myself
will
be
ultimately
retained
oh
that
reminds
me
said
eustace
about
money
you
know
i
quite
see
how
i
am
going
to
pay
for
all
this
game
i
have
got
about
fifty
pounds
spare
cash
in
the
world
and
that
all
and
i
know
enough
to
be
aware
that
fifty
pounds
do
not
go
far
in
a
lawsuit
blankly
james
looked
at
john
and
john
at
james
this
was
very
trying
fifty
pounds
will
go
a
good
way
in
fees
suggested
james
at
length
rubbing
his
bald
head
with
his
handkerchief
possibly
answered
john
pettishly
but
how
about
the
remuneration
of
the
plaintiff
legal
advisers
ca
you
addressing
eustace
manage
to
get
the
money
from
someone
well
said
eustace
there
lady
holmhurst
perhaps
if
i
offered
to
share
the
spoil
with
her
if
there
was
any
dear
me
no
said
john
that
would
be
certainly
not
chimed
in
james
holding
up
his
hand
in
dismay
most
clearly
it
would
be
and
did
it
come
to
the
knowledge
of
the
court
nobody
can
say
what
might
not
happen
indeed
answered
eustace
with
a
sigh
i
do
quite
know
what
you
mean
but
i
seem
to
have
said
something
very
wrong
the
odds
on
a
handicap
are
child
play
to
understand
beside
this
law
he
added
sadly
it
is
obvious
james
said
john
that
putting
aside
other
matters
this
would
prove
independent
of
pecuniary
reward
a
most
interesting
case
for
you
to
conduct
that
is
so
john
replied
james
but
as
you
must
be
well
aware
the
etiquette
of
my
profession
will
not
allow
me
to
conduct
a
case
for
nothing
upon
that
point
above
all
others
etiquette
rules
us
with
a
rod
of
iron
the
stomach
of
the
bar
collective
and
individual
is
revolted
and
scandalised
at
the
idea
of
one
of
its
members
doing
anything
for
nothing
yes
put
in
eustace
i
have
always
understood
they
were
regular
nailers
quite
so
my
dear
james
quite
so
said
john
with
a
sweet
smile
a
fee
must
be
marked
upon
the
brief
of
learned
counsel
and
that
fee
be
paid
to
him
together
with
many
other
smaller
fees
for
learned
counsel
is
like
the
and
at
the
stations
he
does
not
work
unless
you
drop
something
down
him
but
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
learned
counsel
from
returning
that
fee
and
all
the
little
fees
indeed
james
you
will
see
that
this
practice
is
common
amongst
the
most
eminent
of
your
profession
when
for
instance
they
require
an
advertisement
or
wish
to
pay
a
delicate
compliment
to
a
constituency
what
do
they
do
then
they
wait
till
they
find
marked
upon
a
brief
and
then
resign
their
fee
why
should
you
not
do
the
same
in
this
case
in
your
own
interest
of
course
if
we
win
the
cause
the
other
side
or
the
estate
will
pay
the
costs
and
if
we
lose
you
will
at
least
have
had
the
advantage
the
priceless
advantage
of
a
unique
advertisement
very
well
john
let
it
be
so
said
james
with
magnanimity
your
check
for
fees
will
be
duly
returned
but
it
must
be
understood
that
they
are
to
be
presented
not
at
the
bank
said
john
hastily
i
have
recently
had
to
oblige
a
client
he
added
by
way
of
explanation
to
eustace
and
my
balance
is
rather
low
no
said
james
i
quite
understand
i
was
going
to
say
to
be
presented
to
my
clerk
and
with
this
solemn
farce
the
conference
came
to
an
end
chapter
xvii
how
augusta
was
filed
that
very
afternoon
eustace
returned
to
lady
holmhurst
house
in
to
tell
his
dear
augusta
that
she
must
attend
on
the
following
morning
to
be
filed
in
the
registry
at
somerset
house
as
may
be
imagined
though
willing
to
go
any
reasonable
length
to
oblige
her
lover
augusta
not
unnaturally
resisted
this
course
violently
and
was
supported
in
her
resistance
by
her
friend
lady
holmhurst
who
however
presently
left
the
room
leaving
them
to
settle
it
as
they
liked
i
do
think
that
it
is
a
little
hard
said
augusta
with
a
stamp
of
her
foot
that
after
all
that
i
have
gone
through
i
should
be
taken
off
to
have
my
unfortunate
back
stared
at
by
a
doctor
some
one
or
other
and
then
be
shut
up
with
a
lot
of
musty
old
wills
in
a
registry
well
my
dearest
girl
said
eustace
either
it
must
be
done
or
else
the
whole
thing
must
be
given
up
john
short
declares
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
document
should
be
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
officer
of
the
court
but
how
am
i
going
to
live
in
a
cupboard
or
in
an
iron
safe
with
a
lot
of
wills
asked
augusta
feeling
very
cross
indeed
i
do
know
i
am
sure
said
eustace
john
short
says
that
that
is
a
matter
which
the
learned
doctor
will
have
to
settle
his
own
opinion
is
that
the
learned
doctor
confound
him
will
order
that
you
should
accompany
him
about
wherever
he
goes
till
the
trial
comes
off
for
you
see
in
that
way
you
would
never
be
out
of
the
custody
of
an
officer
of
the
court
but
went
on
eustace
gloomily
all
i
can
tell
him
if
he
makes
that
order
is
that
if
he
takes
you
about
with
him
he
will
have
to
take
me
too
why
said
augusta
why
because
i
do
trust
him
that
why
old
oh
yes
i
dare
say
he
is
old
and
besides
just
think
this
learned
gentleman
has
practised
for
twenty
years
in
the
divorce
court
now
i
ask
you
what
can
you
expect
from
a
gentleman
however
learned
who
has
practised
for
twenty
years
in
the
divorce
court
i
know
him
went
on
eustace
vindictively
i
know
him
he
will
fall
in
love
with
you
himself
why
he
would
be
an
old
duffer
if
he
did
really
said
augusta
bursting
out
laughing
you
are
too
ridiculous
eustace
i
do
know
about
being
ridiculous
augusta
but
if
you
think
i
am
going
to
let
you
be
marched
about
by
that
learned
doctor
without
my
being
there
to
look
after
you
you
are
mistaken
why
of
course
he
would
fall
in
love
with
you
or
some
of
his
clerks
would
nobody
could
be
near
you
for
a
couple
of
days
without
doing
so
do
you
think
so
said
augusta
looking
at
him
very
sweetly
yes
i
do
he
answered
and
thus
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
and
was
not
resumed
till
on
the
following
morning
at
eleven
eustace
who
had
managed
to
get
a
few
days
leave
from
his
employers
arrived
with
john
short
to
take
augusta
and
lady
holmhurst
who
was
going
to
chaperon
her
to
somerset
house
whither
notwithstanding
her
objections
of
the
previous
day
she
had
at
last
consented
to
go
short
was
introduced
and
much
impressed
both
the
ladies
by
the
extraordinary
air
of
learning
and
command
which
was
stamped
upon
his
countenance
he
wanted
to
inspect
the
will
at
once
but
augusta
struck
at
this
saying
that
it
would
be
quite
enough
to
have
her
shoulders
stared
at
once
that
day
with
a
sigh
and
a
shake
of
the
head
at
her
unreasonableness
john
short
submitted
and
then
the
carriage
came
round
and
they
were
all
driven
off
to
somerset
house
presently
they
were
there
and
after
threading
innumerable
chilly
passages
reached
a
dismal
room
with
an
almanack
a
dirty
deal
table
and
a
few
chairs
in
it
wherein
were
congregated
several
solicitors
clerks
waiting
their
turn
to
appear
before
the
registrar
here
they
waited
for
or
more
to
augusta
considerable
discomfort
for
she
soon
found
that
she
was
an
object
of
curiosity
and
closest
attention
to
the
solicitors
clerks
who
never
took
their
eyes
off
her
presently
she
discovered
the
reason
for
having
remarkably
quick
ears
she
overheard
one
of
the
solicitors
clerks
a
callow
little
man
with
yellow
hair
and
an
enormous
diamond
pin
whose
appearance
somehow
reminded
her
of
a
chicken
tell
another
who
was
evidently
of
the
jewish
faith
that
she
augusta
was
the
respondent
in
the
famous
divorce
case
of
jones
jones
and
was
going
to
appear
before
the
registrar
to
submit
herself
to
cross
examination
in
some
matter
connected
with
a
grant
of
alimony
now
as
all
london
was
talking
about
the
alleged
iniquities
of
the
jones
in
question
whose
moral
turpitude
was
only
equalled
by
her
beauty
augusta
did
not
feel
best
pleased
although
she
perceived
that
she
instantly
became
an
object
of
heartfelt
admiration
to
the
clerks
presently
however
somebody
poked
his
head
through
the
door
which
he
opened
just
wide
enough
to
admit
it
and
bawling
out
short
re
meeson
vanished
as
abruptly
as
he
had
come
now
lady
holmhurst
if
you
please
said
john
short
allow
me
to
show
the
way
if
you
will
kindly
follow
with
the
will
this
way
please
in
another
minute
the
unfortunate
will
found
herself
in
a
large
and
lofty
room
at
the
top
of
which
with
his
back
to
the
light
sat
a
most
gentleman
who
as
they
advanced
rose
with
a
politeness
that
one
does
not
generally
expect
from
officials
on
a
fixed
salary
and
bowing
asked
them
to
be
seated
well
what
can
i
do
for
you
ah
and
he
put
on
his
and
referred
to
his
notes
short
you
wish
to
file
a
will
i
understand
and
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
of
some
sort
in
the
case
yes
sir
there
are
said
john
short
with
much
meaning
the
will
to
be
filed
in
the
registry
is
the
last
true
will
of
jonathan
meeson
of
pompadour
hall
in
the
county
of
warwick
and
the
property
concerned
amounts
to
about
two
millions
upon
last
motion
day
the
death
of
jonathan
meeson
who
was
supposed
to
have
sunk
in
the
kangaroo
was
allowed
to
be
presumed
and
probate
has
been
taken
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
however
the
said
jonathan
meeson
perished
in
kerguelen
land
some
days
after
the
shipwreck
and
before
he
died
he
duly
executed
a
fresh
will
in
favour
of
his
nephew
eustace
meeson
the
gentleman
before
you
miss
augusta
smithers
what
said
the
learned
registrar
is
this
miss
smithers
whom
we
have
been
reading
so
much
about
lately
the
kerguelen
land
heroine
yes
i
am
miss
smithers
she
said
with
a
little
blush
and
this
is
lady
holmhurst
whose
husband
and
she
checked
herself
it
gives
me
much
pleasure
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
smithers
said
the
learned
doctor
courteously
shaking
hands
and
bowing
to
lady
holmhurst
proceedings
which
eustace
watched
with
the
jaundiced
eye
of
suspicion
he
beginning
already
said
that
ardent
lover
to
himself
i
knew
how
it
would
be
trust
my
gus
into
his
custody
never
i
had
rather
be
committed
for
contempt
the
best
thing
that
i
can
do
sir
went
on
john
short
impatiently
for
to
his
severe
eye
these
interruptions
were
not
seemly
will
be
to
at
once
offer
you
inspection
of
the
document
which
i
may
state
is
of
an
unusual
character
and
he
looked
at
augusta
who
poor
girl
coloured
to
the
eyes
quite
so
quite
so
said
the
learned
registrar
well
has
miss
smithers
got
the
will
perhaps
she
will
produce
it
miss
smithers
the
will
said
john
short
oh
i
am
afraid
that
i
do
not
quite
understand
to
be
more
precise
sir
the
will
is
tattooed
on
miss
smithers
almost
shouted
the
learned
doctor
literally
bounding
from
his
chair
the
will
is
tattooed
upon
miss
smithers
back
continued
john
short
in
a
perfectly
unmoved
tone
and
it
is
now
my
duty
to
offer
you
inspection
of
the
document
and
to
take
your
instructions
as
to
how
you
propose
to
file
it
in
the
registry
inspection
of
the
document
inspection
of
the
document
gasped
the
astonished
doctor
how
am
i
to
inspect
the
document
i
must
leave
that
to
you
sir
said
john
short
regarding
the
learned
registrar
shrinking
form
with
contempt
not
unmixed
with
pity
the
will
is
on
the
lady
back
and
i
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
mean
to
get
a
grant
with
the
document
annexed
lady
holmhurst
began
to
laugh
and
as
for
the
learned
doctor
anything
more
absurd
than
he
looked
intrenched
as
he
was
behind
his
office
chair
with
perplexity
written
on
his
face
it
would
be
impossible
to
imagine
well
he
said
at
length
i
suppose
that
i
must
come
to
a
decision
it
is
a
painful
matter
very
to
a
person
of
modest
temperament
however
i
can
not
shrink
from
my
duty
and
must
face
it
therefore
he
went
on
with
an
air
of
judicial
sternness
therefore
miss
smithers
i
must
trouble
you
to
show
me
this
alleged
will
there
is
a
cupboard
there
and
he
pointed
to
the
corner
of
the
room
where
you
can
make
make
the
necessary
preparations
oh
it
is
quite
so
bad
as
that
said
augusta
with
a
sigh
and
she
began
to
remove
her
jacket
dear
me
he
said
observing
her
movement
with
alarm
i
suppose
she
is
hardened
he
continued
to
himself
but
i
dare
say
one
gets
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
upon
desert
islands
meanwhile
poor
augusta
had
got
her
jacket
off
she
was
dressed
in
an
evening
dress
and
had
a
white
silk
scarf
over
her
shoulder
this
she
removed
oh
he
said
i
see
in
evening
dress
well
of
course
that
is
quite
a
different
matter
and
so
that
is
the
will
well
i
have
had
some
experience
but
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
anything
like
it
before
signed
and
attested
but
not
dated
ah
unless
he
added
the
date
is
lower
down
no
said
augusta
there
is
no
date
i
could
not
stand
any
more
tattooing
it
was
all
done
at
one
sitting
and
i
got
faint
i
do
wonder
at
it
i
am
sure
i
think
it
is
the
bravest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
and
he
bowed
with
much
grace
ah
muttered
eustace
he
beginning
to
pay
compliments
now
insidious
old
hypocrite
well
went
on
the
innocent
and
eminently
respectable
object
of
his
suspicions
of
course
the
absence
of
a
date
does
not
invalidate
a
will
it
is
matter
for
proof
that
is
all
but
there
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
give
any
opinion
about
the
case
it
is
quite
beyond
me
and
besides
that
is
not
my
business
but
now
miss
smithers
as
you
have
once
put
yourself
in
the
custody
of
the
registry
in
the
capacity
of
a
will
might
i
ask
if
you
have
any
suggestion
to
make
as
to
how
you
are
to
be
dealt
with
obviously
you
can
not
be
locked
up
with
the
other
wills
and
equally
obviously
it
is
against
the
rules
to
allow
a
will
to
go
out
of
the
custody
of
the
court
unless
by
special
permission
of
the
court
also
it
is
clear
that
i
can
not
put
any
restraint
upon
the
liberty
of
the
subject
and
order
you
to
remain
with
me
indeed
i
doubt
if
it
would
be
possible
to
do
so
by
any
means
short
of
an
act
of
parliament
under
these
circumstances
i
am
i
confess
a
little
confused
as
to
what
course
should
be
taken
with
reference
to
this
important
alleged
will
what
i
have
to
suggest
sir
said
short
is
that
a
certified
copy
of
the
will
should
be
filed
and
that
there
should
be
a
special
paragraph
inserted
in
the
affidavit
of
scripts
detailing
the
circumstances
ah
said
the
learned
doctor
polishing
his
you
have
given
me
an
idea
with
miss
smithers
consent
we
will
file
something
better
than
a
certified
copy
of
the
will
we
will
file
a
photographic
copy
the
inconvenience
to
miss
smithers
will
be
trifling
and
it
may
prevent
questions
being
raised
hereafter
have
you
any
objections
to
that
my
dear
asked
lady
holmhurst
oh
no
i
suppose
not
said
augusta
mournfully
i
seem
to
be
public
property
now
very
well
then
excuse
me
for
a
moment
said
the
learned
doctor
there
is
a
photographer
close
by
whom
i
have
had
occasion
to
employ
officially
i
will
write
and
see
if
he
can
come
round
in
a
few
minutes
an
answer
came
back
from
the
photographer
that
he
would
be
happy
to
wait
upon
doctor
probate
at
three
up
to
which
hour
he
was
engaged
well
said
the
doctor
it
is
clear
that
i
can
not
let
miss
smithers
out
of
the
custody
of
the
court
till
the
photograph
is
taken
let
me
see
i
think
that
yours
was
my
last
appointment
this
morning
now
what
do
you
say
to
the
idea
of
something
to
eat
we
are
not
five
minutes
drive
from
simpson
and
i
shall
feel
delighted
if
you
will
make
a
pleasure
of
a
necessity
lady
holmhurst
who
was
getting
very
hungry
said
that
she
should
be
most
pleased
and
accordingly
they
all
with
the
exception
of
john
short
who
departed
about
some
business
saying
that
he
would
return
at
three
drove
off
in
lady
holmhurst
carriage
to
the
restaurant
where
this
delightful
specimen
of
the
genus
registrar
stood
them
a
most
sumptuous
champagne
lunch
and
made
himself
so
agreeable
that
both
the
ladies
nearly
fell
in
love
with
him
and
even
eustace
was
constrained
to
admit
to
himself
that
good
things
can
come
out
of
the
divorce
court
finally
the
doctor
wound
up
the
proceedings
which
were
of
a
most
lively
order
and
included
an
account
of
augusta
adventures
with
a
toast
i
hear
from
lady
holmhurst
he
said
that
you
two
young
people
are
going
to
take
the
preliminary
step
um
towards
a
possible
future
appearance
in
that
court
with
which
i
had
for
many
years
the
honor
of
being
connected
that
is
that
you
are
going
to
get
married
now
matrimony
is
according
to
my
somewhat
extended
experience
an
undertaking
of
a
venturesome
order
though
cases
occasionally
come
under
one
observation
where
the
results
have
proved
to
be
in
every
way
satisfactory
and
i
must
say
that
if
i
may
form
an
opinion
from
the
facts
as
they
are
before
me
i
never
knew
an
engagement
entered
into
under
more
promising
or
more
romantic
auspices
here
the
young
gentleman
quarrels
with
his
uncle
in
taking
the
part
of
the
young
lady
and
thereby
is
disinherited
of
vast
wealth
then
the
young
lady
under
the
most
terrible
circumstances
takes
steps
of
a
nature
that
not
one
woman
in
five
hundred
would
have
done
to
restore
to
him
that
wealth
whether
or
no
those
steps
will
ultimately
prove
successful
i
do
not
know
and
if
i
did
like
herodotus
i
should
prefer
not
to
say
but
whether
the
wealth
comes
or
goes
it
is
impossible
but
that
a
sense
of
mutual
confidence
and
a
mutual
respect
and
admiration
that
is
if
a
more
quiet
thing
certainly
also
a
more
enduring
thing
than
mere
must
and
will
result
from
them
meeson
you
are
indeed
a
fortunate
man
in
miss
smithers
you
are
going
to
marry
beauty
courage
and
genius
and
if
you
will
allow
an
older
man
of
some
experience
to
drop
the
official
and
give
you
a
word
of
advice
it
is
this
always
try
to
deserve
your
good
fortune
and
remember
that
a
man
who
in
his
youth
finds
such
a
woman
and
is
enabled
by
circumstances
to
marry
her
is
indeed
on
by
joy
and
cherished
of
the
and
now
i
will
end
my
sermon
and
wish
you
both
health
and
happiness
and
fulness
of
days
and
he
drank
off
his
glass
of
champagne
and
looked
so
pleasant
and
kindly
that
augusta
longed
to
kiss
him
on
the
spot
and
as
for
eustace
he
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
and
then
and
there
a
friendship
began
between
the
two
which
endures
till
now
and
then
they
all
went
back
to
the
office
and
there
was
the
photographer
waiting
with
all
his
apparatus
and
astonished
enough
he
was
when
he
found
out
what
the
job
was
that
he
had
to
do
however
the
task
proved
an
easy
one
enough
as
the
light
of
the
room
was
suitable
and
the
dark
lines
of
cuttle
ink
upon
augusta
neck
would
the
man
said
come
out
perfectly
in
the
photograph
so
he
took
two
or
three
shots
at
her
back
and
then
departed
saying
that
he
would
bring
a
reproduction
to
be
filed
in
the
registry
in
a
couple
of
days
and
after
that
the
learned
registrar
also
shook
hands
with
them
and
said
that
he
need
detain
them
no
longer
as
he
now
felt
justified
in
allowing
augusta
out
of
his
custody
and
so
they
departed
glad
to
have
got
over
the
first
step
so
pleasantly
chapter
xviii
augusta
flies
of
course
augusta
story
so
far
as
it
was
publicly
known
had
created
no
small
stir
which
was
considerably
emphasised
when
pictures
of
her
appeared
in
the
illustrated
papers
and
it
was
discovered
that
she
was
young
and
charming
but
the
excitement
great
as
it
was
was
as
nothing
compared
to
that
which
arose
when
the
first
whispers
of
the
tale
of
the
will
which
was
tattooed
upon
her
shoulders
began
to
get
about
paragraphs
and
stories
about
this
will
appeared
in
the
papers
but
of
course
she
took
no
notice
of
these
on
the
fourth
day
however
after
she
had
been
photographed
for
the
purposes
of
the
registry
things
came
to
a
climax
it
so
happened
that
on
that
morning
lady
holmhurst
asked
augusta
to
go
to
a
certain
shop
in
to
get
some
lace
which
she
required
to
trim
her
dresses
and
accordingly
at
about
twelve
she
started
accompanied
by
the
lady
maid
as
soon
as
they
shut
the
front
door
of
the
house
in
she
noticed
two
or
three
men
who
were
loitering
about
and
who
instantly
followed
them
staring
at
her
with
all
their
eyes
she
made
her
way
along
however
without
taking
any
notice
until
she
got
to
by
which
time
there
were
quite
a
score
of
people
walking
after
her
whispering
excitedly
at
each
other
in
itself
the
first
thing
that
she
saw
was
a
man
selling
photographs
evidently
he
was
doing
a
roaring
trade
for
there
was
a
considerable
crowd
round
him
and
he
was
shouting
something
which
she
could
not
catch
presently
a
gentleman
who
had
bought
one
of
the
photographs
stopped
just
in
front
of
her
to
look
at
it
and
as
he
was
short
and
augusta
was
tall
she
could
see
over
his
shoulder
and
the
next
second
started
back
with
an
indignant
exclamation
no
wonder
for
the
photograph
was
one
of
herself
as
she
had
been
taken
in
the
low
dress
in
the
registry
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
there
was
the
picture
of
the
will
tattooed
right
across
her
shoulders
nor
did
her
troubles
end
there
for
at
that
moment
a
man
came
bawling
down
the
street
carrying
a
number
of
the
first
edition
of
an
evening
paper
description
and
picture
of
the
lovely
of
the
cockatoo
he
yelled
with
the
will
tattooed
upon
taken
from
the
original
photograph
facsimile
picture
oh
dear
me
said
augusta
to
the
maid
that
is
really
too
bad
let
us
go
home
but
meanwhile
the
crowd
at
her
back
had
gathered
and
increased
to
an
extraordinary
extent
and
was
slowly
inclosing
her
in
a
circle
the
fact
was
that
the
man
who
had
followed
her
from
had
told
the
others
who
joined
their
ranks
who
the
lady
was
and
she
was
now
identified
that
her
said
one
man
who
said
another
why
the
miss
smithers
as
escaped
from
the
kangaroo
and
has
the
will
on
her
back
in
course
there
was
a
howl
of
exultation
from
the
mob
and
in
another
second
the
wretched
augusta
was
pressed
together
with
the
lady
maid
who
began
to
scream
with
fright
right
up
against
a
while
a
crowd
of
eager
faces
mostly
unwashed
were
pushed
almost
into
her
own
indeed
so
fierce
was
the
crowd
in
its
attempt
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
latest
curiosity
that
she
began
to
think
that
she
would
be
thrown
down
and
trampled
under
foot
when
timely
relief
arrived
in
the
shape
of
two
policemen
and
a
gentleman
volunteer
who
managed
to
rescue
her
and
get
them
into
a
hansom
cab
which
started
for
pursued
by
a
shouting
crowd
of
nondescript
individuals
now
augusta
was
a
woman
of
and
resolution
but
this
sort
of
thing
was
too
trying
and
accordingly
accompanied
by
lady
holmhurst
she
went
off
that
very
day
to
some
rooms
in
a
little
riverside
hotel
on
the
thames
when
eustace
walking
down
the
strand
that
afternoon
found
every
full
of
accurate
pictures
of
the
shoulders
of
his
beloved
he
was
simply
furious
and
rushing
to
the
photographer
who
had
taken
the
picture
in
the
registry
threatened
him
with
proceedings
of
every
sort
and
kind
the
man
admitted
outright
that
he
had
put
the
photographs
upon
the
market
saying
that
he
had
never
stipulated
not
to
do
so
and
that
he
could
not
afford
to
throw
away
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
when
a
chance
of
making
it
came
in
his
way
thereon
eustace
departed
still
vowing
vengeance
to
consult
the
legal
twins
as
a
result
of
this
within
a
week
james
short
made
a
motion
for
and
injunction
against
the
photographer
restraining
the
sale
of
the
photographs
in
question
on
the
ground
that
such
sale
being
of
copies
of
a
document
vital
to
a
cause
now
pending
in
the
court
those
copies
having
been
obtained
through
the
instrumentality
of
an
officer
of
the
court
probate
the
sale
thereof
amounted
to
a
contempt
inasmuch
as
if
for
no
other
reason
the
photographer
who
obtained
them
became
technically
and
for
that
purpose
only
an
officer
of
the
court
and
had
therefore
no
right
to
part
with
them
or
any
of
them
without
the
leave
of
the
court
it
will
be
remembered
that
this
motion
gave
rise
to
some
very
delicate
questions
connected
with
the
powers
of
the
court
in
such
a
matter
and
also
incidentally
with
the
law
of
photographic
copyright
it
is
also
memorable
for
the
unanimous
and
luminous
judgment
finally
delivered
by
the
lords
justices
of
appeal
whereby
the
sale
of
the
photographs
was
stopped
and
the
photographer
was
held
to
have
been
guilty
of
a
technical
contempt
this
judgment
contained
perhaps
the
most
searching
and
learned
definition
of
constructive
contempt
that
has
yet
been
formulated
but
for
the
text
of
this
i
must
refer
the
student
to
the
law
reports
because
as
it
took
two
hours
to
deliver
i
fear
that
it
would
notwithstanding
its
many
beauties
be
thought
too
long
for
the
purpose
of
this
history
unfortunately
however
it
did
not
greatly
benefit
augusta
the
victim
of
the
unlawful
dissemination
of
photographs
of
her
shoulders
inasmuch
as
the
judgment
was
not
delivered
till
a
week
after
the
great
case
of
meeson
addison
and
another
had
been
settled
about
a
week
after
augusta
adventure
in
a
motion
was
made
in
the
court
of
probate
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
addison
and
roscoe
who
were
the
executors
and
principal
beneficiaries
under
the
former
will
of
november
demanding
that
the
court
should
order
the
plaintiff
to
file
a
further
and
better
affidavit
of
scripts
with
the
original
will
got
up
by
him
attached
the
object
of
course
being
to
compel
an
inspection
of
the
document
this
motion
which
first
brought
the
whole
case
under
the
notice
of
the
public
was
strenuously
resisted
by
james
short
and
resulted
in
the
matter
being
referred
to
the
learned
registrar
for
his
report
on
the
next
motion
day
this
report
was
presented
and
on
its
appearing
from
it
that
the
photography
had
taken
place
in
his
presence
and
accurately
represented
the
tattoo
marks
on
the
lady
shoulders
the
court
declined
to
harass
the
will
by
ordering
her
to
submit
to
any
further
inspection
before
the
trial
it
was
on
this
occasion
that
it
transpired
that
the
will
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
plaintiff
a
fact
at
which
the
court
metaphorically
opened
its
eyes
after
this
the
defendants
obtained
leave
to
amend
their
answer
to
the
plaintiffs
statement
of
claim
at
first
they
had
only
pleaded
that
the
testator
had
not
duly
executed
the
alleged
will
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
cap
sec
and
that
he
did
not
know
and
approve
the
contents
thereof
but
now
they
added
a
plea
to
the
effect
that
the
said
alleged
will
was
obtained
by
the
undue
influence
of
augusta
smithers
or
as
one
of
the
learned
counsel
for
the
defendants
put
it
much
more
clearly
at
the
trial
that
the
will
had
herself
procured
the
will
by
an
undue
projection
of
her
own
will
upon
the
unwilling
mind
of
the
testator
and
so
the
time
went
on
as
often
as
he
could
eustace
got
away
from
london
and
went
down
to
the
little
riverside
hotel
and
was
as
happy
as
a
man
can
be
who
has
a
tremendous
law
suit
hanging
over
him
the
law
no
doubt
is
an
admirable
institution
out
of
which
a
large
number
of
people
make
a
living
and
a
proportion
of
benefit
accrues
to
the
community
at
large
but
woe
unto
those
who
form
the
of
its
operations
for
instance
the
court
of
chancery
is
an
excellent
institution
in
theory
and
looks
after
the
affairs
of
minors
upon
the
purest
principles
but
how
many
of
its
wards
after
and
as
a
result
of
one
of
its
interferences
have
to
struggle
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
under
a
load
of
debt
raised
to
pay
the
crushing
costs
to
employ
the
court
of
chancery
to
look
after
wards
is
something
as
though
one
set
a
tame
elephant
to
pick
up
pins
no
doubt
he
could
pick
them
up
but
it
would
cost
something
to
feed
him
it
is
a
perfectly
arguable
proposition
that
the
court
of
chancery
produces
as
much
wretchedness
and
poverty
as
it
prevents
and
it
certainly
is
a
bold
step
except
under
the
most
exceptionable
circumstances
to
place
anybody
in
its
custody
who
has
money
that
can
be
dissipated
in
law
expenses
but
of
course
these
are
revolutionary
remarks
which
one
can
not
expect
everybody
to
agree
with
least
of
all
the
conveyancing
counsel
of
the
court
however
this
may
be
certainly
his
impending
lawsuit
proved
a
fly
in
eustace
honey
never
a
day
passed
but
some
fresh
worry
arose
james
and
john
the
legal
twins
fought
like
heroes
and
held
their
own
although
their
experience
was
so
small
as
men
of
talent
almost
invariably
do
when
they
are
put
to
it
but
it
was
difficult
for
eustace
to
keep
them
supplied
even
with
sufficient
money
for
expenses
and
of
course
as
was
natural
in
a
case
in
which
such
enormous
sums
were
at
stake
and
in
which
the
defendants
were
already
men
of
vast
wealth
they
found
the
flower
of
the
entire
talent
and
weight
of
the
bar
arrayed
against
them
naturally
eustace
felt
and
so
did
james
short
who
notwithstanding
his
pomposity
and
the
technicality
of
his
talk
was
both
a
clever
and
sensible
man
that
more
counsel
men
of
weight
and
experience
ought
to
be
briefed
but
there
were
absolutely
no
funds
for
this
purpose
nor
was
anybody
likely
to
advance
any
upon
the
security
of
a
will
tattooed
upon
a
young
lady
back
this
was
awkward
because
success
in
law
proceedings
so
very
often
leans
towards
the
weightiest
purse
and
judges
however
impartial
being
but
men
after
all
are
more
apt
to
listen
to
an
argument
which
is
urged
upon
their
attention
by
an
than
on
one
advanced
by
an
unknown
junior
however
there
the
fact
was
and
they
had
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
a
point
in
their
favour
was
that
the
case
although
of
a
most
remarkable
nature
was
comparatively
simple
and
did
not
involve
any
great
mass
of
documentary
evidence
chapter
xix
meeson
addison
and
another
the
most
wearisome
times
go
by
at
last
if
only
one
lives
to
see
the
end
of
them
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
at
length
on
one
fine
morning
about
a
quarter
to
ten
of
the
law
courts
clock
that
projects
its
ghastly
hideousness
upon
unoffending
augusta
accompanied
by
eustace
lady
holmhurst
and
thomas
the
wife
of
captain
thomas
who
had
come
up
from
visiting
her
relatives
in
the
eastern
counties
in
order
to
give
evidence
found
herself
standing
in
the
big
entrance
to
the
new
law
courts
feeling
as
though
she
would
give
five
years
of
her
life
to
be
anywhere
else
this
way
my
dear
said
eustace
john
short
said
that
he
would
meet
us
by
the
statue
in
the
hall
accordingly
they
passed
into
the
archway
by
the
oak
stand
where
the
are
displayed
augusta
glanced
at
them
as
she
went
and
the
first
thing
that
her
eyes
fell
on
was
probate
and
divorce
division
court
at
meeson
addison
and
another
and
the
sight
made
her
feel
ill
in
another
moment
they
had
passed
a
policeman
of
gigantic
size
monstrum
horrendum
informe
ingens
who
watches
and
wards
the
through
which
so
much
human
learning
wretchedness
and
worry
pass
day
by
day
and
were
standing
in
the
long
but
narrow
and
hall
which
appears
to
have
been
the
best
thing
that
the
architectural
talent
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
capable
of
producing
to
the
right
of
the
door
on
entering
is
a
statue
of
the
architect
of
a
pile
of
which
england
has
certainly
no
cause
to
feel
proud
and
here
a
black
bag
full
of
papers
in
his
hand
stood
john
short
wearing
that
air
of
excitement
upon
his
countenance
which
is
so
commonly
to
be
seen
in
the
law
courts
here
you
are
he
said
i
was
beginning
to
be
afraid
that
you
would
be
late
we
are
first
on
the
list
you
know
the
judge
fixed
it
specially
to
suit
the
convenience
of
the
he
on
the
other
side
you
know
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
sure
i
do
know
how
poor
james
will
get
on
there
are
more
than
twenty
counsel
against
him
for
all
the
legatees
under
the
former
will
are
represented
at
any
rate
he
is
well
up
in
his
facts
and
there
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
very
much
law
in
the
case
meanwhile
they
had
been
proceeding
up
the
long
hall
till
they
came
to
a
poky
little
staircase
which
had
just
been
dug
out
in
the
wall
the
necessity
for
a
staircase
at
that
end
of
the
hall
whereby
the
court
floor
could
be
reached
having
to
all
appearance
originally
escaped
the
attention
of
the
architect
on
getting
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
they
turned
to
the
left
and
then
to
the
left
again
if
they
had
had
any
doubt
as
to
which
road
they
should
take
it
would
have
been
speedily
decided
by
the
long
string
of
wigs
which
were
streaming
away
in
the
direction
of
divorce
court
no
thicker
and
thicker
grew
the
wigs
it
was
obvious
that
the
of
meeson
addison
and
another
would
not
want
for
hearers
indeed
augusta
and
her
friends
soon
realised
the
intensity
of
the
public
interest
in
a
way
that
was
as
impressive
as
it
was
disagreeable
for
just
past
the
admiralty
court
the
passage
was
entirely
blocked
by
an
enormous
mass
of
barristers
there
might
have
been
five
hundred
or
more
of
them
there
they
were
choked
up
together
in
their
ranks
waiting
for
the
door
of
the
court
to
be
opened
at
present
it
was
guarded
by
six
or
eight
attendants
who
with
the
help
of
a
wooden
barrier
attempted
to
keep
the
surging
multitude
at
bay
while
those
behind
cried
forward
and
those
in
front
cried
back
how
on
earth
are
we
going
to
get
through
asked
augusta
and
at
that
moment
john
short
caught
hold
of
an
attendant
who
was
struggling
about
in
the
skirts
of
the
crowd
like
a
fly
in
a
cup
of
tea
and
asked
him
the
same
question
explaining
that
their
presence
was
necessary
to
the
show
i
bothered
if
i
know
sir
you
ca
come
this
way
i
suppose
i
must
let
you
through
by
the
underground
passage
from
the
other
court
why
he
went
on
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
admiralty
court
hang
me
if
i
believe
that
we
shall
all
be
crushed
to
death
by
them
there
barristers
it
would
take
a
regiment
of
cavalry
to
keep
them
back
and
they
are
a
lot
they
are
and
they
ai
no
work
to
do
and
that
why
they
comes
kicking
and
tearing
and
worriting
just
to
see
a
bit
of
painting
on
a
young
lady
shoulders
by
this
time
they
had
passed
through
the
admiralty
court
which
was
not
sitting
and
been
conducted
down
a
sort
of
well
that
terminated
in
the
space
occupied
by
the
judge
clerks
and
other
officers
of
the
court
in
another
minute
they
found
themselves
emerging
in
a
similar
space
in
the
other
court
before
taking
the
seat
that
was
pointed
out
to
her
and
the
other
witnesses
in
the
well
of
the
court
immediately
below
those
reserved
for
queen
counsel
augusta
glanced
round
the
body
of
the
court
was
as
yet
quite
empty
for
the
seething
mob
outside
had
not
yet
burst
in
though
their
repeated
shouts
of
open
the
door
could
be
plainly
heard
but
the
jury
box
was
full
not
with
a
jury
for
the
case
was
to
be
tried
before
the
court
itself
but
of
various
distinguished
individuals
including
several
ladies
who
had
obtained
orders
the
little
gallery
above
was
also
crowded
with
people
as
for
the
seats
devoted
to
counsel
in
the
cause
they
were
crammed
to
overflowing
with
the
representatives
of
the
various
defendants
so
crammed
indeed
that
the
wretched
james
short
sole
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
had
to
establish
himself
and
his
papers
in
the
centre
of
the
third
bench
sometimes
used
by
solicitors
heavens
said
eustace
to
augusta
counting
the
heads
there
are
counsel
against
us
what
will
that
unfortunate
james
do
against
so
many
i
do
know
i
sure
said
augusta
with
a
sigh
it
does
seem
quite
fair
does
it
but
then
you
see
there
was
no
money
just
then
john
short
came
up
he
had
been
to
speak
to
his
brother
augusta
being
a
novelist
and
therefore
a
professional
student
of
human
physiognomy
was
engaged
in
studying
the
legal
types
before
her
which
she
found
resolved
themselves
into
two
classes
the
sharp
class
and
the
solid
class
who
on
earth
are
they
all
she
asked
oh
he
said
that
the
he
appears
with
fiddlestick
pearl
and
bean
for
the
defendant
addison
next
to
him
is
the
who
with
playford
middlestone
blowhard
and
ross
is
for
the
other
defendant
roscoe
next
to
him
is
turphy
with
the
spectacles
on
he
is
supposed
to
have
a
great
effect
on
a
jury
i
do
know
the
name
of
his
junior
but
he
looks
as
though
he
were
going
to
eat
one
does
he
he
is
for
one
of
the
legatees
that
man
behind
is
stickon
he
is
for
one
of
the
legatees
also
i
suppose
that
he
finds
probate
and
divorce
an
interesting
subject
because
he
is
always
writing
books
about
them
next
to
him
is
howles
who
my
brother
says
is
the
best
comic
actor
in
the
court
the
short
gentleman
in
the
middle
is
telly
he
reports
for
the
you
see
as
this
is
an
important
case
he
has
got
somebody
to
help
him
to
take
it
that
long
man
with
a
big
wig
he
writes
novels
like
you
do
only
not
half
such
good
ones
the
next
but
at
this
moment
john
short
was
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
a
rather
man
who
wore
an
continually
fixed
in
his
right
eye
he
was
news
of
the
great
firm
news
and
news
who
were
conducting
the
case
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
short
i
believe
said
news
contemplating
his
youthful
form
with
pity
not
unmixed
with
compassion
yes
um
short
i
have
been
consulting
with
my
clients
and
um
the
attorney
and
and
fiddlestick
and
we
are
quite
willing
to
admit
that
there
are
circumstances
of
doubt
in
this
case
which
would
justify
us
in
making
an
offer
of
settlement
before
i
can
enter
into
that
news
said
john
with
great
dignity
i
must
request
the
presence
of
my
counsel
oh
certainly
said
news
and
accordingly
james
was
summoned
from
his
elevated
perch
where
he
was
once
more
going
through
his
notes
and
the
heads
of
his
opening
speech
although
he
already
knew
his
brief
which
to
do
it
justice
had
been
prepared
with
extraordinary
care
and
elaboration
almost
by
heart
and
next
moment
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
found
himself
in
consultation
with
an
attorney
and
a
look
here
short
said
the
first
of
these
great
men
addressing
james
as
though
he
had
known
him
intimately
for
years
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
only
that
moment
ascertained
his
name
from
fiddlestick
who
was
himself
obliged
to
refer
to
bean
before
he
could
be
sure
of
it
look
here
short
do
you
think
that
we
can
settle
this
business
you
got
a
strongish
case
but
there
are
some
ugly
things
against
you
as
no
doubt
you
know
i
do
quite
admit
that
said
james
of
course
of
course
said
attorney
but
still
in
my
judgment
if
you
will
not
be
offended
at
my
expressing
it
you
are
not
quite
on
firm
ground
supposing
for
instance
your
young
lady
is
not
allowed
to
give
evidence
i
think
said
a
stout
gentleman
behind
who
wore
upon
his
countenance
the
very
sweetest
and
most
infantile
smile
that
eustace
had
ever
seen
breaking
in
rather
hastily
as
though
he
was
afraid
that
his
learned
leader
was
showing
too
much
of
his
hand
i
think
that
the
case
is
one
that
looked
at
from
either
point
of
view
will
bear
settlement
better
than
fighting
eh
fiddlestick
but
then
i
a
man
of
peace
and
again
he
smiled
most
seductively
at
james
what
are
your
terms
asked
james
the
eminent
counsel
on
the
front
bench
turned
round
and
stuck
their
wigs
together
like
a
lot
of
crows
over
a
bone
and
the
slightly
less
eminent
but
still
highly
distinguished
juniors
on
the
second
bench
craned
forward
to
listen
they
are
going
to
settle
it
eustace
heard
the
barrister
who
was
reporting
for
the
say
to
his
long
assistant
they
always
do
settle
every
case
of
public
interest
grunted
the
long
man
in
answer
we
sha
see
miss
smithers
shoulders
now
well
i
shall
get
an
introduction
to
her
and
ask
her
to
show
them
to
me
i
take
a
great
interest
in
tattooing
meanwhile
fiddlestick
had
been
writing
something
on
a
strip
of
paper
and
handed
to
his
leader
the
who
james
short
saw
with
respectful
admiration
had
guineas
marked
upon
his
brief
he
nodded
carelessly
and
passed
it
on
to
his
junior
who
gave
it
in
turn
to
the
and
playford
when
it
had
gone
the
rounds
news
took
it
and
showed
it
to
his
two
privileged
clients
addison
and
roscoe
addison
was
a
man
roscoe
was
sallow
and
had
a
thin
straggly
black
beard
when
they
looked
at
it
addison
groaned
fiercely
as
a
wounded
bull
and
roscoe
sighed
and
that
sigh
and
groan
told
augusta
who
womanlike
had
all
her
wits
about
her
and
was
watching
every
act
of
the
drama
more
than
it
was
meant
to
do
it
told
her
that
these
gentlemen
were
doing
something
that
they
did
not
like
and
doing
it
because
they
evidently
believed
that
they
had
no
other
course
open
to
them
then
news
gave
the
paper
to
john
short
who
glanced
at
it
and
handed
it
on
to
his
brother
and
eustace
read
it
over
his
shoulder
it
was
very
short
and
ran
thus
terms
offered
half
the
property
and
defendants
pay
all
costs
well
short
said
eustace
what
do
you
say
shall
we
take
it
james
removed
his
wig
and
thoughtfully
rubbed
his
bald
head
it
is
a
very
difficult
position
to
be
put
in
he
said
of
course
a
million
is
a
large
sum
of
money
but
there
are
two
at
stake
my
own
view
is
that
we
had
better
fight
the
case
out
though
of
course
this
is
a
certainty
and
the
result
of
the
case
is
not
i
am
inclined
to
settle
said
eustace
not
because
of
the
case
for
i
believe
in
it
but
because
of
augusta
of
miss
smithers
you
see
she
will
have
to
show
the
tattooing
again
and
that
sort
of
thing
is
very
unpleasant
for
a
lady
oh
as
to
that
said
james
loftily
at
present
she
must
remember
that
she
is
not
a
lady
but
a
legal
document
however
let
us
ask
her
now
augusta
what
shall
we
do
said
eustace
when
he
had
explained
the
offer
you
see
if
we
take
the
offer
you
will
be
spared
a
very
disagreeable
time
you
must
make
up
your
mind
quick
for
the
judge
will
be
here
in
a
minute
oh
never
mind
me
said
augusta
quickly
i
am
used
to
disagreeables
no
i
shall
fight
i
tell
you
they
are
afraid
of
you
i
can
see
it
in
the
face
of
that
horrid
addison
just
now
he
positively
glared
at
me
and
ground
his
teeth
and
he
would
not
do
that
if
he
thought
that
he
was
going
to
win
no
dear
i
shall
fight
it
out
now
very
well
said
eustace
and
he
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
declined
with
thanks
at
the
foot
of
the
offer
just
at
that
moment
there
came
a
dull
roar
from
the
passage
beyond
the
doors
of
the
court
were
being
opened
another
second
and
in
rushed
and
struggled
a
hideous
sea
of
barristers
heavens
how
they
fought
and
kicked
a
maddened
herd
of
buffaloes
could
not
have
behaved
more
desperately
on
rushed
the
white
wave
of
wigs
bearing
the
strong
men
who
hold
the
door
before
them
like
wreckage
on
a
breaker
on
they
came
and
in
forty
seconds
the
court
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
capacity
and
still
there
were
hundreds
of
white
wigged
men
behind
it
was
a
fearful
scene
good
gracious
thought
augusta
to
herself
how
on
earth
do
they
all
get
a
living
a
question
that
many
of
them
would
have
found
it
hard
enough
to
answer
then
suddenly
an
old
gentleman
near
her
whom
she
discovered
to
be
the
usher
jumped
up
and
called
silence
in
commanding
accents
without
producing
much
effect
however
on
the
palpitating
mass
of
humanity
in
front
then
in
came
the
officers
of
the
court
and
a
moment
afterwards
everybody
rose
as
the
judge
entered
and
looking
as
augusta
thought
very
cross
when
he
saw
the
crowded
condition
of
the
court
bowed
to
the
bar
and
took
his
seat
chapter
xx
james
breaks
down
the
registrar
not
augusta
dear
doctor
probate
but
another
registrar
rose
and
called
on
the
case
of
meeson
addison
and
another
and
in
an
instant
the
wretched
james
short
was
on
his
legs
to
open
the
case
what
is
that
gentleman
name
augusta
heard
the
judge
ask
of
the
clerk
after
making
two
or
three
frantic
efforts
to
attract
his
attention
a
proceeding
that
the
position
of
his
desk
rendered
very
difficult
short
my
lord
do
you
appear
alone
for
the
plaintiff
mr
short
asked
the
judge
with
emphasis
yes
my
lord
i
do
answered
james
and
as
he
said
it
every
pair
of
eyes
in
that
crowded
assembly
fixed
themselves
upon
him
and
a
sort
of
audible
smile
seemed
to
run
round
the
court
the
thing
not
unnaturally
struck
the
professional
mind
as
ludicrous
and
without
precedent
and
who
appears
for
the
defendant
i
understand
my
lord
said
the
learned
that
all
my
learned
friends
on
these
two
benches
appear
together
with
myself
for
one
or
other
of
the
defendants
or
are
watching
the
case
in
the
interest
of
legatees
here
a
decided
titter
interrupted
him
i
may
add
that
the
interests
involved
in
this
case
are
very
large
indeed
which
accounts
for
the
number
of
counsel
connected
in
one
way
or
other
with
the
defence
quite
so
attorney
said
the
judge
but
really
the
forces
seem
a
little
out
of
proportion
of
course
the
matter
is
not
one
in
which
the
court
can
interfere
if
your
lordship
will
allow
me
said
james
the
only
reason
that
the
plaintiff
is
so
poorly
represented
is
that
the
funds
to
brief
other
council
were
i
understand
not
forthcoming
i
am
however
well
versed
in
the
case
and
with
your
lordship
permission
will
do
my
best
with
it
very
well
short
said
the
learned
judge
looking
at
him
almost
with
pity
state
your
case
james
in
the
midst
of
a
silence
that
could
be
felt
unfolded
his
pleadings
and
as
he
did
so
for
the
first
time
a
sickening
sense
of
nervousness
took
hold
of
him
and
made
him
tremble
and
of
a
sudden
his
mind
became
dark
most
of
us
have
undergone
this
sensation
at
one
time
or
another
with
less
cause
then
had
poor
james
there
he
was
put
up
almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
conduct
a
most
important
case
upon
which
it
was
scarcely
too
much
to
say
the
interest
of
the
entire
country
was
concentrated
nor
was
this
all
opposed
to
him
were
about
twenty
counsel
all
of
them
men
of
experience
and
including
in
their
ranks
some
of
the
most
famous
leaders
in
england
and
what
was
more
the
court
was
densely
crowded
with
scores
of
men
of
his
own
profession
every
one
of
whom
was
he
felt
regarding
him
with
curiosity
not
unmixed
with
pity
then
there
was
the
tremendous
responsibility
which
literally
seemed
to
crush
him
though
he
had
never
quite
realised
it
before
may
it
please
your
lordship
he
began
and
then
as
i
have
said
his
mind
became
a
ghastly
blank
in
which
dim
and
formless
ideas
flitted
vaguely
to
and
fro
there
was
a
pause
a
painful
pause
read
your
pleadings
aloud
whispered
a
barrister
who
was
sitting
next
him
and
realised
his
plight
this
was
an
idea
one
can
read
pleadings
when
one
can
not
collect
ideas
to
speak
it
is
not
usual
to
do
so
the
counsel
in
a
cause
states
the
substance
of
the
pleadings
leaving
the
court
to
refer
to
them
if
it
thinks
necessary
but
still
there
was
nothing
absolutely
wrong
about
it
so
he
snatched
at
the
papers
and
promptly
began
i
the
plaintiff
is
the
sole
and
universal
legatee
under
the
true
last
will
of
jonathan
meeson
deceased
late
of
pompadour
hall
in
the
county
of
warwick
who
died
on
the
of
december
the
said
will
being
undated
but
duly
executed
on
or
subsequent
to
the
day
of
december
here
the
learned
judge
lifted
his
eyebrows
in
remonstrance
and
cleared
his
throat
preparatory
to
interfering
but
apparently
thought
better
of
it
for
he
took
up
a
blue
pencil
and
made
a
note
of
the
date
of
the
will
ii
went
on
james
on
the
day
of
may
probate
of
an
alleged
will
of
the
said
jonathan
meeson
was
granted
to
the
defendants
the
said
will
bearing
date
the
day
of
november
the
plaintiff
claims
that
the
court
shall
revoke
probate
of
the
said
alleged
will
of
the
said
jonathan
meeson
bearing
date
the
day
of
november
granted
to
the

on

of

a

or

james
short
may
it
please
your
lordship
james
began
again
feeling
dimly
that
he
had
read
enough
pleadings
the
defendants
have
filed
an
answer
pleading
that
the
will
of
the
of
december
was
not
duly
executed
in
accordance
with
the
statute
and
that
the
testator
did
not
know
and
approve
its
contents
and
an
amended
answer
pleading
that
the
said
alleged
will
if
executed
was
obtained
by
the
undue
influence
of
augusta
smithers
and
once
more
his
nervousness
overcame
him
and
he
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
then
came
another
pause
even
more
dreadful
than
the
first
the
judge
took
another
note
as
slowly
as
he
could
and
once
more
cleared
his
throat
but
poor
james
could
not
go
on
he
could
only
wish
that
he
might
then
and
there
expire
rather
than
face
the
hideous
humiliation
of
such
a
failure
but
he
would
have
failed
for
his
very
brain
was
whirling
like
that
of
a
drunken
man
had
it
not
been
for
an
occurrence
that
caused
him
for
ever
after
to
bless
the
name
of
fiddlestick
as
the
name
of
an
eminent
counsel
is
not
often
blessed
in
this
ungrateful
world
for
fiddlestick
who
it
will
be
remembered
was
one
of
the
leaders
for
the
defendants
had
been
watching
his
unfortunate
antagonist
till
realising
how
sorry
was
his
plight
a
sense
of
pity
filled
his
learned
breast
perhaps
he
may
have
remembered
some
occasion
in
the
dim
and
distant
corner
of
the
past
when
he
had
suffered
from
a
similar
access
of
frantic
terror
or
perhaps
he
may
have
been
sorry
to
think
that
a
young
man
should
lose
such
an
unrivalled
opportunity
of
making
a
name
anyhow
he
did
a
noble
act
as
it
happened
he
was
sitting
at
the
corner
of
the
queen
counsel
seats
and
piled
upon
the
desk
before
him
was
a
tremendous
mass
of
law
reports
which
his
clerk
had
arranged
there
containing
cases
to
which
it
might
become
necessary
to
refer
now
in
the
presence
of
these
law
reports
fiddlestick
in
the
goodness
of
his
heart
saw
an
opportunity
of
creating
a
diversion
and
he
created
it
with
a
vengeance
for
throwing
his
weight
suddenly
forward
as
though
by
accident
or
in
a
movement
of
impatience
he
brought
his
bent
arm
against
the
pile
with
such
force
that
he
sent
every
book
and
there
must
have
been
more
than
twenty
of
them
over
the
desk
right
on
to
the
head
and
shoulders
of
his
choleric
client
addison
who
was
sitting
immediately
beneath
on
the
solicitors
bench
down
went
the
books
with
a
crash
and
a
bang
and
carried
away
by
their
weight
down
went
addison
on
to
his
nose
among
them
a
contingency
that
fiddlestick
had
not
foreseen
for
he
had
overlooked
the
fact
of
his
client
vicinity
the
judge
made
an
awful
face
and
then
realising
the
ludicrous
nature
of
the
scene
his
features
relaxed
into
a
smile
but
addison
did
not
smile
he
bounded
up
off
the
floor
books
slipping
off
his
back
in
every
direction
and
holding
his
nose
which
was
injured
with
one
hand
came
skipping
right
at
his
learned
adviser
you
did
it
on
purpose
he
almost
shouted
quite
forgetting
where
he
was
just
let
me
get
at
him
i
have
his
wig
off
and
then
without
waiting
for
any
more
the
entire
audience
burst
out
into
a
roar
of
laughter
which
however
unseemly
was
perfectly
reasonable
during
which
fiddlestick
could
be
seen
apologising
in
dumb
show
with
a
bland
smile
upon
his
countenance
while
news
and
roscoe
between
them
dragged
the
outraged
addison
to
his
seat
and
proffered
him
handkerchiefs
to
wipe
his
bleeding
nose
james
saw
the
whole
thing
and
forgetting
his
position
laughed
too
and
for
some
mysterious
reason
with
the
laugh
his
nervousness
passed
away
the
usher
shouted
silence
with
tremendous
energy
and
before
the
sound
had
died
away
james
was
addressing
the
court
in
a
clear
and
vigorous
voice
conscious
that
he
was
a
thorough
master
of
his
case
and
the
words
to
state
it
in
would
not
fail
him
fiddlestick
had
saved
him
may
it
please
your
lordship
he
began
the
details
of
this
case
are
of
as
remarkable
an
order
as
any
that
to
my
knowledge
have
been
brought
before
the
court
the
plaintiff
eustace
meeson
is
the
sole
of
jonathan
meeson
esquire
the
late
head
of
the
well
known
birmingham
publishing
firm
of
meeson
addison
and
roscoe
under
a
will
bearing
date
the
of
may
the
plaintiff
was
left
sole
heir
to
the
great
wealth
of
his
uncle
that
is
with
the
exception
of
some
legacies
under
a
second
will
now
relied
on
by
the
defendants
and
dated
the
november
the
plaintiff
was
entirely
disinherited
and
the
present
defendants
together
with
some
six
or
eight
legatees
were
constituted
the
sole
beneficiaries
on
or
about
the
december
however
the
testator
executed
a
third
testamentary
document
under
which
the
plaintiff
takes
the
entire
property
and
this
is
the
document
now
propounded
this
testamentary
document
or
rather
will
for
i
submit
that
it
is
in
every
sense
a
properly
executed
will
is
tattooed
upon
the
shoulders
sensation
in
the
court
is
tattooed
upon
the
shoulders
of
a
young
lady
miss
augusta
smithers
who
will
presently
be
called
before
your
lordship
and
to
prevent
any
misunderstanding
i
may
as
well
at
once
state
that
since
this
event
this
lady
has
become
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
plaintiff
renewed
sensation
such
my
lord
are
the
main
outlines
of
the
case
that
i
have
to
present
for
the
consideration
of
the
court
which
i
think
your
lordship
will
understand
is
of
so
remarkable
and
unprecedented
a
nature
that
i
must
crave
your
lordship
indulgence
if
i
proceed
to
open
it
at
some
length
beginning
the
history
at
its
commencement
by
this
time
james
short
had
completely
recovered
his
nerve
and
was
indeed
almost
oblivious
of
the
fact
that
there
was
anybody
present
in
the
court
except
the
learned
judge
and
himself
going
back
to
the
beginning
he
detailed
the
early
history
of
the
relationship
between
eustace
meeson
and
his
uncle
the
publisher
with
which
this
record
has
nothing
to
do
thence
he
passed
to
the
history
of
augusta
relation
with
the
firm
of
meeson
and
which
as
nearly
everybody
in
the
court
not
excepting
the
judge
had
read
jemima
vow
was
very
interesting
to
his
auditors
then
he
went
on
to
the
scene
between
augusta
and
the
publisher
and
detailed
how
eustace
had
interfered
which
interference
had
led
to
a
violent
quarrel
resulting
in
the
young
man
disinheritance
passing
on
he
detailed
how
the
publisher
and
the
published
had
taken
passage
in
the
same
vessel
and
the
tragic
occurrences
which
followed
down
to
final
rescue
and
arrival
in
england
and
finally
ended
his
spirited
opening
by
appealing
to
the
court
not
to
allow
its
mind
to
be
influenced
by
the
fact
that
since
these
events
the
two
chief
actors
had
become
engaged
to
be
married
which
struck
him
he
said
as
a
very
fitting
climax
to
so
romantic
a
story
at
last
he
ceased
and
amidst
a
little
buzz
of
applause
for
the
speech
had
really
been
a
very
fine
one
sat
down
as
he
did
so
he
glanced
at
the
clock
he
had
been
on
his
legs
for
nearly
two
hours
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
but
a
very
little
while
in
another
moment
he
was
up
again
and
had
called
his
first
witness
eustace
meeson
eustace
evidence
was
of
a
rather
formal
order
and
was
necessarily
limited
to
an
account
of
the
relations
between
his
uncle
and
himself
and
between
himself
and
augusta
such
as
it
was
however
he
gave
it
very
well
and
with
a
complete
openness
that
appeared
to
produce
a
favorable
impression
on
the
court
then
fiddlestick
rose
to
devoting
his
efforts
to
trying
to
make
eustace
admit
that
his
behaviour
had
been
of
a
nature
to
amply
justify
his
uncle
behaviour
but
there
was
not
very
much
to
be
made
out
of
it
eustace
detailed
all
that
had
passed
freely
enough
and
it
simply
amounted
to
the
fact
that
there
had
been
angry
words
between
the
two
as
regards
the
treatment
that
augusta
had
met
with
at
the
hands
of
the
firm
in
short
fiddlestick
could
not
do
anything
with
him
and
after
ten
minutes
of
it
sat
down
without
having
advanced
the
case
to
any
appreciable
extent
then
several
of
the
other
counsel
asked
a
question
or
two
apiece
after
which
eustace
was
told
to
stand
down
and
lady
holmhurst
was
called
lady
holmhurst
evidence
was
very
short
merely
amounting
to
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
augusta
shoulders
on
board
the
kangaroo
and
that
there
was
not
then
a
sign
of
tattoo
marks
upon
them
and
when
she
saw
them
again
in
london
they
were
tattooed
no
attempt
was
made
to
her
and
on
the
termination
of
her
evidence
the
court
adjourned
for
lunch
when
it
reassembled
james
short
called
augusta
and
a
murmur
of
expectation
arose
from
the
densely
crowded
audience
as
feeling
very
sick
at
heart
and
looking
more
beautiful
than
ever
she
stepped
towards
the
box
as
she
did
so
the
rose
i
must
object
my
lord
he
said
on
behalf
of
the
defendants
to
this
witness
being
allowed
to
enter
the
box
upon
what
grounds
mr
attorney
said
his
lordship
upon
the
ground
that
her
mouth
is
closed
if
we
are
to
believe
the
plaintiff
story
this
young
lady
is
herself
the
will
of
jonathan
meeson
and
being
so
is
certainly
i
submit
not
competent
to
give
evidence
there
is
no
precedent
for
a
document
giving
evidence
and
i
presume
that
the
witness
must
be
looked
upon
as
a
document
but
attorney
said
the
judge
a
document
is
evidence
and
evidence
of
the
best
sort
undoubtedly
my
lord
and
we
have
no
objection
to
the
document
being
exhibited
for
the
court
to
draw
its
own
conclusion
from
but
we
deny
that
it
is
entitled
to
speak
in
its
own
explanation
a
document
is
a
thing
which
speaks
by
its
written
characters
it
can
not
take
to
itself
a
tongue
and
speak
by
word
of
mouth
also
and
in
support
of
this
i
may
call
your
lordship
attention
to
the
general
principles
of
law
governing
the
interpretation
of
written
documents
i
am
quite
aware
of
those
principles
attorney
and
i
can
not
see
that
they
touch
this
question
as
your
lordship
pleases
then
i
will
fall
back
upon
my
main
contention
that
miss
smithers
is
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
a
document
and
nothing
but
a
document
and
has
no
more
right
to
open
her
mouth
in
support
of
the
plaintiff
case
than
would
any
paper
will
if
it
could
be
miraculously
endowed
with
speech
well
said
the
judge
it
certainly
strikes
me
as
a
novel
point
what
have
you
to
say
to
it
mr
short
all
eyes
were
now
turned
upon
james
for
it
was
felt
that
if
the
point
was
decided
against
him
the
case
was
lost
the
point
to
which
i
wish
you
to
address
yourself
short
went
on
the
learned
judge
is
is
the
personality
of
miss
smithers
so
totally
lost
and
merged
in
what
for
want
of
a
better
term
i
must
call
her
documentary
capacity
as
to
take
away
from
her
the
right
to
appear
before
this
court
like
any
other
sane
human
being
and
give
evidence
of
events
connected
with
its
execution
if
your
lordship
pleases
said
james
i
maintain
that
this
is
not
so
i
maintain
that
the
document
remains
the
document
and
that
for
all
purposes
including
the
giving
of
evidence
concerning
its
execution
miss
smithers
still
remains
miss
smithers
it
would
surely
be
absurd
to
argue
that
because
a
person
has
a
deed
executed
upon
her
she
was
incapacitated
from
giving
evidence
concerning
it
on
the
mere
ground
that
she
was
further
such
a
decision
would
be
contrary
to
equity
and
good
policy
for
persons
could
not
so
lightly
be
deprived
of
their
natural
rights
also
in
this
case
the
plaintiff
action
would
be
absolutely
put
an
end
to
by
any
such
decision
seeing
that
the
signature
of
jonathan
meeson
and
the
attesting
witnesses
to
the
will
could
not
of
course
be
recognised
in
their
tattooed
form
and
there
is
no
other
living
person
who
could
depose
under
what
circumstances
the
signature
came
to
be
there
i
submit
that
the
objection
should
be
overruled
this
said
his
lordship
in
giving
his
decision
is
a
very
curious
point
and
one
which
when
first
raised
by
the
learned
struck
me
with
some
force
but
on
considering
it
and
hearing
short
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
an
objection
that
can
not
be
supported
here
eustace
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
it
is
argued
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
that
miss
smithers
is
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
a
document
a
document
and
nothing
but
a
document
and
as
such
that
her
mouth
is
shut
now
i
think
that
the
learned
can
not
have
thought
this
matter
out
when
he
came
to
that
conclusion
what
are
the
circumstances
a
will
is
supposed
to
have
been
tattooed
upon
this
skin
but
is
the
skin
the
whole
person
does
not
the
intelligence
remain
and
the
individuality
i
think
that
i
can
put
what
i
mean
more
clearly
by
means
of
an
illustration
let
us
suppose
that
i
were
to
uphold
the
defendant
objection
and
that
as
a
consequence
the
plaintiff
case
were
to
break
down
then
let
us
suppose
that
the
plaintiff
had
persuaded
the
witness
to
be
partially
skinned
here
augusta
nearly
jumped
from
her
seat
and
that
she
having
survived
the
operation
was
again
tendered
to
the
court
as
a
witness
would
the
court
then
be
able
under
any
possibility
to
refuse
to
accept
her
evidence
the
document
in
the
form
of
human
parchment
would
then
be
in
the
hands
of
the
officers
of
the
court
and
the
person
from
whom
the
parchment
had
been
removed
would
also
be
before
the
court
could
it
be
still
maintained
that
the
two
were
so
identical
and
inseparable
that
the
disabilities
attaching
to
a
document
must
necessarily
attach
to
the
person
in
my
opinion
certainly
not
or
to
take
another
case
let
us
suppose
that
the
will
had
been
tattooed
upon
the
leg
of
a
person
and
under
similar
circumstances
the
leg
were
cut
off
and
produced
before
the
court
either
in
a
flesh
or
a
mummified
condition
could
it
then
be
seriously
advanced
that
because
the
inscribed
leg
standing
on
the
table
before
the
court
had
once
belonged
to
the
witness
sitting
in
the
therefore
it
was
not
competent
for
the
witness
to
give
evidence
on
account
of
his
or
her
documentary
attributes
certainly
it
could
not
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
that
which
is
separable
must
for
the
purpose
of
law
be
taken
as
already
separated
and
that
the
will
on
the
back
of
this
witness
must
be
looked
upon
as
though
it
were
in
the
hands
at
this
moment
of
the
officers
of
the
court
and
consequently
i
overrule
the
objection
will
your
lordship
take
a
note
of
your
lordship
decision
asked
the
in
view
of
an
appeal
certainly
attorney
let
this
witness
be
sworn
chapter
xxi
grant
as
prayed
accordingly
augusta
was
sworn
and
eustace
observed
that
when
she
removed
her
veil
to
kiss
the
book
the
sight
of
her
sweet
face
produced
no
small
effect
upon
the
crowded
court
then
james
began
his
examination
in
chief
and
following
the
lines
which
he
had
laid
down
in
his
opening
speech
led
her
slowly
whilst
allowing
her
to
tell
her
own
story
as
much
as
possible
to
the
time
of
the
tattooing
of
the
will
on
kerguelen
land
all
along
the
history
had
evidently
interested
everybody
in
the
court
not
excepting
the
judge
intensely
but
now
the
excitement
rose
to
boiling
point
well
said
james
tell
his
lordship
exactly
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
will
of
meeson
was
tattooed
upon
your
shoulders
in
quiet
but
dramatic
language
augusta
accordingly
narrated
every
detail
from
the
time
when
meeson
confided
to
her
his
remorse
at
having
disinherited
his
nephew
up
to
the
execution
of
the
will
at
her
suggestion
by
the
sailor
upon
her
own
shoulders
and
now
miss
smithers
said
james
when
she
had
done
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
to
do
so
but
i
must
ask
you
to
exhibit
the
document
to
the
court
poor
augusta
coloured
and
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
slowly
undid
the
which
hid
her
shoulders
for
of
course
she
had
come
in
low
dress
the
judge
looking
up
sharply
observed
her
natural
distress
if
you
prefer
it
miss
smithers
said
his
lordship
courteously
i
will
order
the
court
to
be
cleared
of
except
those
who
are
actually
engaged
in
the
case
at
these
ominous
words
a
shudder
of
disgust
passed
through
the
ranks
it
would
indeed
they
felt
after
all
their
striving
be
hard
if
they
were
deprived
of
the
sight
of
the
will
and
they
stared
at
her
despairingly
to
see
what
she
would
answer
i
thank
your
lordship
she
said
with
a
little
bow
but
there
would
still
be
so
many
left
that
i
do
not
think
that
it
would
greatly
matter
i
hope
that
everybody
will
understand
my
position
and
extend
their
consideration
to
me
very
well
said
the
judge
and
without
further
ado
she
took
off
the
cloak
and
the
silk
handkerchief
beneath
it
and
stood
before
the
court
dressed
in
a
low
black
dress
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
ask
you
to
come
up
here
said
his
lordship
accordingly
she
walked
round
mounted
the
bench
and
then
turned
her
back
to
the
judge
in
order
that
he
might
examine
what
was
written
on
it
this
he
did
very
carefully
with
the
aid
of
a
magnifying
glass
referring
now
and
again
to
the
photographic
copy
which
doctor
probate
had
filed
in
the
registry
thank
you
he
said
presently
that
will
do
i
am
afraid
that
the
learned
counsel
below
will
wish
to
have
an
opportunity
of
inspection
so
augusta
had
to
descend
and
slowly
walk
along
the
ranks
stopping
before
every
learned
leader
to
be
carefully
examined
while
hundreds
of
eager
eyes
in
the
background
were
fixed
upon
her
unfortunate
neck
however
at
last
it
came
to
an
end
that
will
do
miss
smithers
said
the
judge
for
whose
consideration
she
felt
deeply
grateful
you
can
put
on
your
cloak
again
now
accordingly
she
did
so
and
the
box
the
document
which
you
have
just
shown
the
court
miss
smithers
said
james
is
the
one
which
was
executed
upon
you
in
kerguelen
land
on
or
about
the
day
of
december
last
year
it
is
it
was
i
understand
executed
in
the
presence
of
the
testator
and
the
two
attesting
witnesses
all
three
being
present
together
and
the
signature
of
each
being
tattooed
in
the
presence
of
the
other
it
was
was
the
testator
so
far
as
you
could
judge
at
the
time
of
the
dictation
and
execution
of
the
will
of
sound
mind
memory
and
understanding
most
certainly
he
was
did
you
beyond
the
suggestions
of
which
you
have
already
given
evidence
in
any
way
unduly
influence
the
testator
mind
so
as
to
induce
him
to
make
this
will
i
did
not
and
to
those
facts
you
swear
i
do
then
he
passed
on
to
the
history
of
the
death
of
the
two
sailors
who
had
attested
the
will
and
to
the
account
of
augusta
ultimate
rescue
finally
closing
his
just
as
the
clock
struck
four
whereon
the
court
adjourned
till
the
following
day
as
may
be
imagined
though
things
had
gone
fairly
well
so
far
nobody
concerned
of
our
party
passed
an
night
the
strain
was
too
great
to
admit
of
it
and
really
they
were
all
glad
to
find
themselves
in
the
court
which
was
if
possible
even
more
crowded
on
the
following
morning
filled
with
the
hope
that
that
day
might
see
the
matter
decided
one
way
or
the
other
as
soon
as
the
judge
had
come
in
augusta
resumed
her
place
in
the
and
the
rose
to
her
you
told
the
court
miss
smithers
at
the
conclusion
of
your
evidence
that
you
are
now
engaged
to
be
married
to
meeson
the
plaintiff
now
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
put
a
personal
question
to
you
but
i
must
ask
you
were
you
at
the
time
of
the
tattooing
of
the
will
in
love
with
mr
meeson
this
was
a
and
poor
augusta
coloured
up
beneath
it
however
her
native
wit
came
to
her
aid
if
you
will
define
sir
what
being
in
love
is
i
will
do
my
best
to
answer
your
question
she
said
whereat
the
audience
including
his
lordship
smiled
the
looked
puzzled
as
well
he
might
for
there
are
some
things
which
are
beyond
the
learning
of
even
an
well
he
said
were
you
matrimonially
inclined
towards
mr
meeson
surely
said
the
judge
the
one
thing
does
not
necessarily
include
the
other
i
bow
to
your
lordship
experience
said
attorney
tartly
perhaps
i
had
better
put
my
question
in
this
way
had
you
at
any
time
any
prospect
of
becoming
engaged
to
mr
meeson
none
whatever
did
you
submit
to
this
tattooing
which
must
have
been
painful
with
a
view
of
becoming
engaged
to
the
plaintiff
certainly
not
i
may
point
out
she
added
with
hesitation
that
such
a
disfigurement
is
not
likely
to
add
to
anybody
attractions
please
answer
my
questions
miss
smithers
and
do
not
comment
on
them
how
did
you
come
then
to
submit
yourself
to
such
a
disagreeable
operation
i
submitted
to
it
because
i
thought
it
right
to
do
so
there
being
no
other
apparent
means
at
hand
of
attaining
the
late
meeson
end
also
and
she
paused
also
what
also
i
had
a
regard
for
eustace
meeson
and
i
knew
that
he
had
lost
his
inheritance
through
a
quarrel
about
myself
ah
now
we
are
coming
to
it
then
you
were
tattooed
out
of
regard
for
the
plaintiff
and
not
purely
in
the
interests
of
justice
yes
i
suppose
so
well
attorney
interposed
the
judge
and
what
if
she
was
my
object
my
lord
was
to
show
that
this
young
lady
was
not
the
purely
impassive
medium
in
this
matter
that
my
learned
friend
short
would
lead
the
court
to
believe
she
was
acting
from
motive
most
people
do
said
the
judge
drily
but
it
does
not
follow
that
the
motive
was
an
improper
one
then
the
learned
gentleman
continued
his
directing
all
the
ingenuity
of
his
practised
mind
to
trying
to
prove
by
admissions
first
that
the
testator
was
acting
under
the
undue
influence
of
herself
and
secondly
that
when
the
will
was
executed
he
was
compos
to
this
end
he
dwelt
at
great
length
on
every
detail
of
the
events
between
the
tattooing
of
the
will
and
the
death
of
the
testator
on
the
following
day
making
as
much
as
was
possible
out
of
the
fact
that
he
died
in
a
fit
of
mania
but
do
what
he
would
he
could
not
shake
her
evidence
upon
any
material
point
and
when
at
last
he
sat
down
james
short
felt
that
his
case
had
not
received
any
serious
blow
then
a
few
more
questions
having
been
asked
in
by
various
other
counsel
james
rose
to
and
with
the
object
of
rebutting
the
presumption
of
the
testator
mental
unsoundness
made
augusta
repeat
all
the
details
of
the
confession
that
the
late
publisher
had
made
to
her
as
regards
his
methods
of
trading
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
fury
and
horror
portrayed
upon
the
countenance
of
the
choleric
addison
and
the
cadaverous
roscoe
when
they
saw
the
most
cherished
secrets
of
the
customs
of
the
trade
as
practised
at
meeson
thus
paraded
in
the
open
light
of
day
while
a
dozen
reporters
took
every
detail
down
then
at
last
augusta
was
told
to
stand
down
which
she
did
thankfully
enough
and
thomas
the
wife
of
captain
thomas
was
called
she
proved
the
finding
of
augusta
on
the
island
and
that
she
had
seen
the
hat
of
one
of
the
sailors
and
the
empty
and
also
produced
the
shell
out
of
which
the
men
had
drunk
the
rum
which
shell
the
judge
had
called
augusta
to
identify
what
was
most
important
however
was
that
she
gave
the
most
distinct
evidence
that
she
had
herself
seen
the
late
meeson
interred
and
identified
the
body
as
that
of
the
late
publisher
by
picking
out
his
photograph
from
among
a
bundle
of
a
dozen
that
were
handed
to
her
also
she
swore
that
when
augusta
came
aboard
the
whaler
the
tattoo
marks
on
her
back
were
not
healed
no
of
the
witness
worth
the
name
having
been
attempted
james
called
a
clerk
from
the
office
of
the
late
owners
of
the
kangaroo
who
produced
the
roll
of
the
ship
on
which
the
names
of
the
two
sailors
johnnie
butt
and
bill
jones
duly
appeared
this
closed
the
plaintiff
case
and
the
at
once
proceeded
to
call
his
witnesses
reserving
his
remarks
till
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
he
had
only
two
witnesses
todd
the
lawyer
who
drew
and
attested
the
will
of
and
his
clerk
who
also
attested
it
and
their
examination
did
not
take
long
in
however
both
these
witnesses
admitted
that
the
testator
was
in
a
great
state
of
passion
when
he
executed
the
will
and
gave
details
of
the
lively
scene
that
then
occurred
then
the
rose
to
address
the
court
for
the
defendants
he
said
there
were
two
questions
before
the
court
reserving
for
the
present
the
question
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence
of
augusta
smithers
and
those
were
first
did
the
tattoo
marks
upon
the
neck
constitute
a
will
at
all
and
secondly
supposing
that
they
did
was
it
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
that
these
undated
marks
were
duly
executed
by
a
sane
and
uninfluenced
man
in
the
presence
of
the
witnesses
as
required
by
the
statute
he
maintained
in
the
first
place
that
these
marks
were
no
will
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
but
feeling
that
he
was
not
on
very
sound
ground
on
this
point
quickly
passed
on
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
case
with
much
force
and
ability
he
dwelt
upon
the
strangeness
of
the
whole
story
and
how
it
rested
solely
upon
the
evidence
of
one
witness
augusta
smithers
it
was
only
if
the
court
accepted
her
evidence
as
it
stood
that
it
could
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
will
was
executed
at
all
or
indeed
that
the
two
attesting
witnesses
were
on
the
island
at
all
considering
the
relations
which
existed
between
this
witness
and
the
plaintiff
was
the
court
prepared
to
accept
her
evidence
in
this
unreserved
way
was
it
prepared
to
decide
that
this
will
in
favour
of
a
man
with
whom
the
testator
had
violently
quarrelled
and
had
disinherited
in
consequence
of
that
quarrel
was
not
if
indeed
it
was
executed
at
all
extorted
by
this
lady
from
a
weak
and
dying
and
possibly
a
deranged
man
and
with
this
question
the
learned
gentleman
sat
down
he
was
followed
briefly
by
the
and
fiddlestick
but
though
they
talked
fluently
enough
addressing
themselves
to
various
minor
points
they
had
nothing
fresh
of
interest
to
adduce
and
finishing
at
three
james
rose
to
reply
on
the
whole
case
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
there
was
a
moment
pause
while
he
was
arranging
his
notes
and
then
just
as
he
was
about
to
begin
the
judge
said
quietly
thank
you
short
i
do
not
think
that
i
need
trouble
you
and
james
sat
down
with
a
gasp
for
he
knew
that
the
cause
was
won
then
his
lordship
began
and
after
giving
a
masterly
summary
of
the
whole
case
concluded
as
follows
such
are
the
details
of
the
most
remarkable
probate
cause
that
i
ever
remember
to
have
had
brought
to
my
notice
either
during
my
career
at
the
bar
or
on
the
bench
it
will
be
obvious
as
the
learned
has
said
that
the
whole
case
really
lies
between
two
points
is
the
document
on
the
back
of
augusta
smithers
a
sufficient
will
to
carry
the
property
and
if
so
is
the
unsupported
story
of
that
lady
as
to
the
execution
of
the
document
to
be
believed
now
what
does
the
law
understand
by
the
term
surely
it
understands
some
writing
that
expresses
the
wish
or
will
of
a
person
as
to
the
disposition
of
his
property
after
his
decease
this
writing
must
be
executed
with
certain
formalities
but
if
it
is
so
executed
by
a
person
not
labouring
under
any
mental
or
other
disability
it
is
indefeasible
except
by
the
subsequent
execution
of
a
fresh
testamentary
document
or
by
its
destruction
or
attempted
destruction
or
by
marriage
subject
to
these
formalities
required
by
the
law
the
form
of
the
document
provided
that
its
meaning
is
clear
is
immaterial
now
do
the
tattoo
marks
on
the
back
of
this
lady
constitute
such
a
document
and
do
they
convey
the
true
last
will
or
wish
of
the
testator
that
is
the
first
point
that
i
have
to
decide
and
i
decide
it
in
the
affirmative
it
is
true
that
it
is
not
usual
for
testamentary
documents
to
be
tattooed
upon
the
skin
of
a
human
being
but
because
it
is
not
usual
it
does
not
follow
that
a
tattooed
document
is
not
a
valid
one
the
ninth
section
of
the
statute
of
cap
specifies
that
no
will
shall
be
valid
unless
it
shall
be
in
writing
but
can
not
this
tattooing
be
considered
as
writing
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
i
am
clearly
of
opinion
that
it
can
if
only
on
the
ground
that
the
material
used
was
ink
a
natural
ink
it
is
true
that
of
the
but
still
ink
for
i
may
remark
that
the
natural
product
of
the
was
at
one
time
largely
used
in
this
country
for
that
very
purpose
further
in
reference
to
this
part
of
the
case
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
testator
was
no
eccentric
being
who
from
whim
or
perversity
chose
this
extraordinary
method
of
signifying
his
wishes
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
property
he
was
a
man
placed
in
about
as
terrible
a
position
as
it
is
possible
to
conceive
he
was
if
we
are
to
believe
the
story
of
miss
smithers
most
sincerely
anxious
to
revoke
a
disposition
of
his
property
which
he
now
standing
face
to
face
with
the
greatest
issue
of
this
life
recognised
to
be
unjust
and
which
was
certainly
contrary
to
the
promptings
of
nature
as
experienced
by
most
men
and
yet
in
this
terrible
strait
in
which
he
found
himself
and
notwithstanding
the
earnest
desire
which
grew
more
intense
as
his
vital
forces
ebbed
he
could
find
absolutely
no
means
of
carrying
out
his
wish
at
length
however
this
plan
of
tattooing
his
will
upon
the
living
flesh
on
a
younger
and
stronger
person
is
presented
to
him
and
he
eagerly
avails
himself
of
it
and
the
tattooing
is
duly
carried
out
in
his
presence
and
at
his
desire
and
as
duly
signed
and
witnessed
can
it
be
seriously
argued
that
a
document
so
executed
does
not
fulfil
the
bare
requirements
of
the
law
i
think
that
it
can
not
and
am
of
opinion
that
such
a
document
is
as
much
a
valid
will
as
though
it
had
been
engrossed
upon
the
skin
of
a
sheep
and
duly
signed
and
witnessed
in
the
temple
and
now
i
will
come
to
the
second
point
is
the
evidence
of
miss
smithers
to
be
believed
first
let
us
see
where
it
is
corroborated
it
is
clear
from
the
testimony
of
lady
holmhurst
that
when
on
board
the
kangaroo
miss
smithers
had
no
tattoo
marks
upon
her
shoulders
it
is
equally
clear
from
the
unshaken
testimony
of
thomas
that
when
she
was
rescued
by
the
american
whaler
her
back
was
marked
with
tattooing
then
in
the
healing
stage
with
tattooing
which
could
not
possibly
have
been
inflicted
by
herself
or
by
the
child
who
was
her
sole
living
companion
it
is
also
proved
that
there
was
seen
upon
the
island
by
thomas
the
dead
body
of
a
man
which
she
was
informed
was
that
of
meeson
and
which
she
here
in
court
identified
by
means
of
a
photograph
also
this
same
witness
produced
a
shell
which
she
picked
up
in
one
of
the
huts
said
to
be
the
shell
used
by
the
sailors
to
drink
the
rum
that
led
to
their
destruction
and
she
swore
that
she
saw
a
sailor
hat
lying
on
the
shore
now
all
this
is
corroborative
evidence
and
of
a
sort
not
to
be
despised
indeed
as
to
one
point
that
of
the
approximate
date
of
the
execution
of
the
tattooing
it
is
to
my
mind
final
still
there
does
remain
an
enormous
amount
that
must
be
accepted
or
not
according
as
to
whether
or
no
credence
can
be
placed
in
the
unsupported
testimony
of
miss
smithers
for
we
can
not
call
on
a
child
so
young
as
the
present
lord
holmhurst
to
bear
witness
in
a
court
of
justice
if
miss
smithers
for
instance
is
not
speaking
the
truth
when
she
declares
that
the
signature
of
the
testator
was
tattooed
upon
her
under
his
immediate
direction
or
that
it
was
tattooed
in
the
presence
of
the
two
sailors
butt
and
jones
whose
signatures
were
also
tattooed
in
the
presence
of
the
testator
and
of
each
other
no
will
at
all
was
executed
and
the
plaintiff
case
collapses
utterly
since
from
the
very
nature
of
the
facts
evidence
as
to
handwriting
would
of
course
be
useless
now
i
approach
the
decision
of
this
point
after
anxious
thought
and
some
hesitation
it
is
not
a
light
thing
to
set
aside
a
formally
executed
document
such
as
the
will
of
upon
which
the
defendants
rely
and
to
entirely
alter
the
devolution
of
a
vast
amount
of
property
upon
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
single
witness
it
seems
to
me
however
that
there
are
two
tests
which
the
court
can
more
or
less
set
up
as
standards
wherewith
to
measure
the
truth
of
the
matter
the
first
of
these
is
the
accepted
probability
of
the
action
of
an
individual
under
any
given
set
of
circumstances
as
drawn
from
our
common
knowledge
of
human
nature
and
the
second
the
behaviour
and
tone
of
the
witness
both
in
the
box
and
in
the
course
of
circumstances
that
led
to
her
appearance
there
i
will
take
the
last
of
those
two
first
and
i
may
as
well
state
without
further
delay
that
i
am
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
story
told
by
miss
smithers
it
would
to
my
mind
be
impossible
for
any
man
whose
intelligence
had
been
trained
by
years
of
experience
in
this
and
other
courts
and
whose
daily
duty
it
is
to
discriminate
as
to
the
credibility
of
testimony
to
disbelieve
the
history
so
circumstantially
detailed
in
the
box
by
miss
smithers
sensation
i
watched
her
demeanour
both
under
examination
and
very
closely
indeed
and
i
am
convinced
that
she
was
telling
the
absolute
truth
so
far
as
she
knew
it
and
now
to
come
to
the
second
point
it
has
been
suggested
as
throwing
doubt
upon
miss
smithers
story
that
the
existence
of
an
engagement
to
marry
between
her
and
the
plaintiff
may
have
prompted
her
to
concoct
a
monstrous
fraud
for
his
benefit
and
this
is
suggested
although
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
tattooing
no
such
engagement
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
exist
or
was
within
measurable
distance
of
the
parties
it
did
not
exist
said
the
but
the
disposing
mind
existed
in
other
words
that
she
was
then
love
if
notwithstanding
attorney
difficulty
in
defining
it
i
may
use
the
term
with
the
plaintiff
this
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
case
there
are
some
things
which
it
is
quite
beyond
the
power
of
any
judge
or
jury
to
decide
and
one
of
them
certainly
is
at
what
exact
period
of
her
acquaintance
with
a
future
husband
a
young
lady
regard
turns
into
a
warmer
feeling
but
supposing
that
the
is
right
and
that
although
she
at
that
moment
clearly
had
no
prospect
of
marrying
him
since
she
had
left
england
to
seek
her
fortune
at
the
antipodes
the
plaintiff
was
looked
upon
by
this
lady
with
that
kind
of
regard
which
is
supposed
to
precede
the
matrimonial
contract
the
circumstance
in
my
mind
tells
rather
in
his
favour
than
against
him
for
in
passing
i
may
remark
that
this
young
lady
has
done
a
thing
which
is
in
its
way
little
short
of
heroic
the
more
so
because
it
has
a
ludicrous
side
she
has
submitted
to
an
operation
which
must
not
only
have
been
painful
but
which
is
and
always
will
be
a
blot
upon
her
beauty
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
the
when
he
says
that
she
did
not
make
the
sacrifice
without
a
motive
which
may
have
sprung
from
a
keen
sense
of
justice
and
of
gratitude
to
the
plaintiff
for
his
interference
on
her
behalf
or
from
a
warmer
feeling
in
either
case
there
is
nothing
discreditable
about
it
rather
the
reverse
in
fact
and
taken
by
itself
there
is
certainly
nothing
here
to
cause
me
to
disbelieve
the
evidence
of
miss
smithers
one
question
only
seems
to
me
to
remain
is
there
anything
to
show
that
the
testator
was
not
at
the
time
of
the
execution
of
the
will
of
a
sound
and
disposing
mind
and
is
there
anything
in
his
conduct
or
history
to
render
the
hypothesis
of
his
having
executed
his
will
so
improbable
that
the
court
should
take
the
improbability
into
account
as
to
the
first
point
i
can
find
nothing
miss
smithers
expressly
swore
that
it
was
not
the
case
nor
was
her
statement
shaken
by
a
very
searching
she
admitted
indeed
that
shortly
before
death
he
wandered
in
his
mind
and
thought
that
he
was
surrounded
by
the
shades
of
authors
waiting
to
be
revenged
upon
him
but
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
the
mind
thus
to
fail
at
the
last
and
it
is
not
extraordinary
that
this
dying
man
should
conjure
before
his
brain
the
shapes
of
those
with
some
of
whom
he
appears
to
have
dealt
harshly
during
his
life
nor
do
i
consider
it
in
any
way
impossible
that
when
he
felt
his
end
approaching
he
should
have
wished
to
reverse
the
sentence
of
his
anger
and
restore
his
nephew
whose
only
offence
had
been
a
somewhat
indiscreet
use
of
the
language
of
truth
the
inheritance
to
vast
wealth
of
which
he
had
deprived
him
such
a
course
strikes
me
as
being
a
most
natural
and
proper
one
and
perfectly
in
accordance
with
the
first
principles
of
human
nature
the
whole
tale
is
undoubtedly
of
a
wild
and
romantic
order
and
once
again
illustrates
the
saying
that
is
stranger
than
fiction
but
i
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
the
fact
that
the
deceased
did
by
means
of
tattooing
carried
out
by
his
order
legally
execute
his
true
last
will
in
favour
of
his
eustace
meeson
upon
the
shoulders
of
augusta
smithers
on
or
about
the
day
of
december
this
being
so
i
pronounce
for
the
will
propounded
by
the
plaintiff
and
there
will
be
a
grant
as
prayed
with
costs
my
lord
asked
james
rising
no
i
am
not
inclined
to
go
that
length
this
litigation
has
arisen
through
the
testator
own
act
and
the
estate
must
bear
the
burden
if
your
lordship
pleases
said
james
and
sat
down
short
said
the
judge
clearing
his
throat
i
do
not
often
speak
in
such
a
sense
but
i
do
feel
called
upon
to
compliment
you
upon
the
way
in
which
you
have
conducted
this
case
in
some
ways
one
of
the
strangest
and
most
important
that
has
ever
come
before
me
having
for
your
opponents
so
formidable
an
array
of
learned
gentlemen
the
performance
would
have
been
creditable
to
anybody
of
greater
experience
and
longer
years
as
it
is
i
believe
it
to
be
unprecedented
james
turned
colour
bowed
and
sat
down
knowing
that
he
was
a
made
man
and
that
it
would
be
his
own
fault
if
his
future
career
at
the
bar
was
not
now
one
of
almost
unexampled
prosperity
chapter
xxii
george
the
court
broke
up
in
confusion
and
augusta
now
that
the
strain
was
over
noticed
with
amusement
that
the
dark
array
of
learned
counsel
who
had
been
fighting
with
all
their
strength
to
win
the
case
of
their
clients
did
not
seem
to
be
particularly
distressed
at
the
reverse
that
they
had
suffered
but
chatted
away
gaily
as
they
tied
up
their
papers
with
scraps
of
red
tape
she
did
not
perhaps
quite
realize
that
having
done
their
best
and
earned
their
little
fees
they
did
not
feel
called
on
to
be
because
the
court
declined
to
take
the
view
they
were
paid
to
support
but
it
was
a
very
different
matter
with
addison
and
roscoe
who
had
just
seen
two
millions
of
money
slip
from
their
avaricious
grasp
they
were
rich
men
already
but
that
fact
did
not
gild
the
pill
for
the
possession
of
money
does
not
detract
from
the
desire
for
the
acquisition
of
more
addison
was
purple
with
fury
and
roscoe
hid
his
saturnine
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
just
then
the
rose
and
seeing
james
short
coming
forward
to
speak
to
his
clients
stopped
him
and
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
let
me
congratulate
you
my
dear
fellow
he
said
i
never
saw
a
case
better
done
it
was
a
perfect
pleasure
to
me
and
i
am
very
glad
that
the
judge
thought
fit
to
compliment
you
a
most
unusual
thing
i
can
only
say
that
i
hope
that
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
having
you
as
my
junior
sometimes
in
the
future
if
you
have
no
other
engagement
i
wish
that
you
would
call
round
at
my
chambers
about
twelve
addison
who
was
close
by
overheard
this
little
speech
and
a
new
light
broke
upon
him
with
a
bound
he
plunged
between
james
and
the
i
see
what
it
is
now
he
said
in
a
voice
shaking
with
wrath
been
sold
i
am
a
victim
to
collusion
you
had
five
hundred
of
my
money
confound
you
he
shouted
almost
shaking
his
fist
in
the
face
of
his
learned
and
dignified
adviser
and
now
you
are
congratulating
this
man
and
he
pointed
his
finger
at
james
you
been
bribed
to
betray
me
sir
you
are
a
rascal
yes
a
rascal
at
this
point
the
learned
forgetting
his
learning
and
the
exceeding
augustness
of
his
position
actually
reverted
to
those
first
principles
of
human
nature
of
which
the
judge
had
spoken
and
doubled
his
fist
indeed
had
not
news
utterly
aghast
at
such
a
sight
rushed
up
and
dragged
his
infuriated
client
back
there
is
no
knowing
what
scandalous
thing
might
not
have
happened
but
somehow
he
was
got
rid
of
and
everybody
melted
away
leaving
the
ushers
to
go
round
and
collect
the
and
pens
which
strewed
the
empty
court
and
now
good
people
said
lady
holmhurst
i
think
that
the
best
thing
that
we
can
do
is
all
to
go
home
and
rest
before
dinner
i
ordered
it
at
seven
and
it
is
five
i
hope
that
you
will
come
too
short
and
bring
your
brother
with
you
for
i
am
sure
that
you
both
of
you
deserve
your
dinner
if
ever
anybody
did
and
so
they
all
went
and
a
very
jolly
dinner
they
had
as
well
they
might
at
last
however
it
came
to
an
end
and
the
legal
twins
departed
beaming
like
stars
with
happiness
and
champagne
and
then
lady
holmhurst
departed
also
and
left
eustace
and
augusta
alone
life
is
a
queer
thing
said
eustace
here
this
morning
i
was
a
publisher
reader
at
a
year
and
now
if
this
verdict
holds
it
seems
that
i
am
one
of
the
wealthiest
men
in
england
yes
dear
said
augusta
and
with
all
the
world
at
your
feet
for
life
is
full
of
opportunities
to
the
rich
you
have
a
great
future
before
you
eustace
i
really
am
ashamed
to
marry
so
rich
a
man
my
darling
he
said
putting
his
arm
round
her
whatever
i
have
i
owe
to
you
do
you
know
there
is
only
one
thing
that
i
fear
about
all
this
money
if
it
really
comes
to
us
and
that
is
that
you
will
be
so
taken
up
with
what
people
call
social
duties
and
the
distribution
of
it
that
you
will
give
up
your
writing
so
many
women
are
like
that
whatever
ability
they
have
seems
to
vanish
utterly
away
upon
their
they
say
afterwards
that
they
have
no
time
but
i
often
think
it
is
because
they
do
not
choose
to
make
time
yes
answered
augusta
but
then
that
is
because
they
do
not
really
love
their
work
whatever
it
may
be
those
who
really
love
their
art
as
i
love
mine
with
heart
and
soul
and
strength
will
not
be
so
easily
checked
of
course
distractions
and
cares
come
with
marriage
but
on
the
other
hand
if
one
marries
happily
there
comes
quiet
of
mind
and
cessation
from
that
ceaseless
restlessness
that
is
so
fatal
to
good
work
you
need
not
fear
eustace
if
i
can
i
will
show
the
world
that
you
have
not
married
a
dullard
and
if
i
ca
why
my
dear
it
will
be
because
i
am
one
that
comes
very
nicely
from
the
author
of
vow
said
eustace
with
sarcasm
really
my
dear
what
between
your
fame
as
a
writer
and
as
the
heroine
of
the
shipwreck
and
of
the
great
will
case
i
think
that
i
had
better
take
a
back
seat
at
once
for
i
shall
certainly
be
known
as
the
husband
of
the
beautiful
and
gifted
meeson
oh
no
answered
augusta
do
be
afraid
nobody
would
dream
of
speaking
slightingly
of
the
owner
of
two
millions
of
money
well
never
mind
chaffing
about
the
money
said
eustace
we
got
it
yet
for
one
thing
i
have
got
something
to
ask
you
i
must
be
going
to
bed
said
augusta
firmly
no
nonsense
said
eustace
you
are
not
going
and
he
caught
her
by
the
arm
unhand
me
sir
said
augusta
with
majesty
now
what
do
you
want
you
silly
boy
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
marry
me
next
week
next
week
good
gracious
no
said
augusta
why
i
have
not
got
my
things
and
for
the
matter
of
that
i
am
sure
i
do
know
where
the
money
is
coming
from
to
pay
for
them
with
things
said
eustace
with
fine
contempt
you
managed
to
live
on
kerguelen
land
without
things
so
i
do
see
why
you
ca
get
married
without
them
though
for
the
matter
of
that
i
will
get
anything
you
want
in
six
hours
i
never
did
hear
such
bosh
as
women
talk
about
listen
dear
for
heaven
sake
let
get
married
and
have
a
little
quiet
i
can
assure
you
that
if
you
do
your
life
wo
be
worth
having
after
this
you
will
be
hunted
like
a
wild
thing
and
interviewed
and
painted
and
worried
to
death
whereas
if
you
get
married
well
it
will
be
better
for
us
in
a
quiet
way
you
know
well
there
is
something
in
that
said
augusta
but
supposing
that
there
should
be
an
appeal
and
the
decision
should
be
reversed
what
would
happen
then
well
then
we
should
have
to
work
for
our
living
that
all
i
have
got
my
billet
and
you
could
write
for
the
press
until
your
five
agreement
with
meeson
and
has
run
out
i
would
put
you
in
the
way
of
that
i
see
lots
of
writing
people
at
my
shop
well
said
augusta
i
will
speak
to
bessie
about
it
oh
of
course
lady
holmhurst
will
say
no
said
eustace
gloomily
she
will
think
about
the
and
besides
she
wo
want
to
lose
you
before
she
is
obliged
that
is
all
that
i
can
do
for
you
sir
said
augusta
with
decision
there
come
that
enough
and
breaking
away
from
him
she
made
a
pretty
little
curtsey
and
vanished
now
i
wonder
what
she
means
to
do
meditated
eustace
as
the
butler
brought
him
his
hat
i
really
should
not
wonder
if
she
came
round
to
it
but
then
one
never
knows
how
a
woman
will
take
a
thing
if
she
will
she
will
etc
and
now
it
may
strike
the
reader
as
very
strange
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
ten
days
from
the
date
of
the
above
conversation
there
was
a
gathering
at
george
close
by
i
say
small
for
the
marriage
had
been
kept
quite
secret
in
order
to
prevent
from
marching
down
upon
it
in
their
thousands
as
they
would
certainly
have
done
had
it
been
announced
that
the
heroine
of
the
great
will
case
was
going
to
be
married
therefore
the
party
was
very
select
augusta
had
no
relations
of
her
own
and
so
she
had
asked
probate
with
whom
she
had
struck
up
a
great
friendship
to
come
and
give
her
away
and
though
the
old
gentleman
previous
career
had
had
more
connection
with
the
undoing
of
the
nuptial
tie
than
with
its
contraction
he
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
refuse
i
shall
be
neglecting
my
duties
you
know
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
shaking
his
head
it
very
wrong
very
wrong
for
i
ought
to
be
at
the
registry
but
well
perhaps
i
can
manage
to
come
very
wrong
though
very
wrong
and
quite
out
of
my
line
of
business
i
expect
that
i
shall
begin
to
address
the
court
i
mean
the
clergyman
for
the
petitioner
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
on
this
auspicious
day
the
registering
was
left
to
look
after
itself
and
as
a
matter
of
history
it
may
be
stated
that
no
question
was
asked
in
parliament
about
it
then
there
was
lady
holmhurst
looking
very
pretty
in
her
widow
dress
and
her
boy
dick
who
was
in
the
highest
spirits
and
bursting
with
health
and
wonder
at
these
strange
proceedings
on
the
part
of
his
auntie
and
of
course
the
legal
twins
brought
up
the
rear
and
there
in
the
vestry
stood
augusta
in
her
bridal
dress
as
sweet
a
woman
as
ever
the
sun
shone
on
and
looking
at
her
beautiful
face
probate
nearly
fell
in
love
with
her
himself
and
yet
it
was
a
sad
face
just
then
she
was
happy
very
as
a
loving
woman
who
is
about
to
be
made
a
wife
should
be
but
when
a
great
joy
draws
near
to
us
it
comes
companioned
by
the
shadows
of
our
old
griefs
the
highest
sort
of
happiness
has
a
peculiar
faculty
of
recalling
to
our
minds
that
which
has
troubled
them
in
the
past
the
truth
being
that
extremes
in
this
as
in
other
matters
will
sometimes
touch
which
would
seem
to
suggest
that
sorrow
and
happiness
however
varied
in
their
bloom
yet
have
a
common
root
thus
it
was
with
augusta
now
as
she
stood
in
the
vestry
there
came
to
her
mind
a
recollection
of
her
dear
little
sister
and
of
how
she
had
prophesied
happy
greatness
and
success
for
her
now
the
happiness
and
the
success
were
at
hand
and
there
in
the
aisle
stood
her
own
true
love
but
yet
the
recollection
of
that
dear
face
and
of
the
little
mound
that
covered
it
rested
on
them
like
a
shadow
it
passed
with
a
sigh
and
in
its
place
there
came
the
memory
of
poor
tombey
but
for
whom
she
would
not
have
been
standing
there
a
bride
and
of
his
last
words
as
he
put
her
into
the
boat
he
was
food
for
fishes
now
poor
fellow
and
she
was
left
alone
with
a
great
and
happy
career
opening
out
before
her
a
career
in
which
her
talents
would
have
free
space
to
work
and
yet
how
odd
to
think
it
two
or
three
score
of
years
and
it
would
all
be
one
and
she
would
be
as
tombey
was
poor
tombey
perhaps
it
was
as
well
that
he
was
not
there
to
see
her
happiness
and
let
us
hope
that
wherever
it
is
we
go
after
the
last
event
we
lose
sight
of
the
world
and
those
we
knew
therein
otherwise
there
must
be
more
hearts
broken
in
heaven
above
than
in
earth
beneath
now
then
miss
smithers
broke
in
probate
for
the
very
last
time
nobody
will
call
you
that
again
you
know
take
my
arm
his
lordship
i
mean
the
parson
is
there
it
was
done
and
they
were
man
and
wife
well
even
the
happiest
marriage
is
always
a
good
thing
to
get
over
it
was
not
a
long
drive
back
to
and
the
very
first
sight
that
greeted
them
on
their
arrival
was
the
infant
from
the
city
john
accompanied
by
his
brother
the
infant
from
james
who
had
presumably
come
to
show
him
the
way
or
more
probably
because
he
thought
that
there
would
be
eatables
going
holding
in
his
hand
a
letter
marked
sir
so
i
thought
that
i
had
better
serve
it
at
once
said
the
first
infant
handing
the
letter
to
john
what
is
it
asked
eustace
nervously
he
had
grown
to
hate
the
sight
of
a
lawyer
letter
with
a
deadly
hate
notice
of
appeal
i
expect
said
john
open
it
man
said
eustace
and
let
get
it
over
accordingly
john
did
so
and
read
as
follows
meeson
addison
and
another
dear
sir
after
consultation
with
our
clients
addison
and
roscoe
we
are
enabled
to
make
you
the
following
offer
if
no
account
is
required
of
the
mesne
profits
that
a
wrong
term
said
james
irritably
mesne
profits
refer
to
profits
derived
from
real
estate
just
like
a
solicitor
to
make
such
a
blunder
the
term
is
perfectly
appropriate
replied
his
twin
with
warmth
there
was
some
real
estate
and
therefore
the
term
can
properly
be
applied
to
the
whole
of
the
income
for
heaven
sake
do
argue
but
get
on
said
eustace
do
you
see
that
i
am
on
tenterhooks
my
clients
continued
john
are
ready
to
undertake
that
no
appeal
shall
be
presented
to
the
recent
case
of
meeson
addison
and
another
if
however
the
plaintiff
insists
upon
an
account
the
usual
steps
will
be
taken
to
bring
the
matter
before
a
higher
obediently
yours
news
and
news
john
short
esq
an
immediate
reply
will
oblige
well
meeson
what
do
you
say
to
that
said
john
but
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
perhaps
you
would
like
to
take
counsel
advice
and
he
pointed
to
james
who
was
rubbing
his
bald
bead
indignantly
oh
no
i
should
not
answered
eustace
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
let
them
stick
to
their
mesne
here
james
made
a
face
well
then
to
their
middle
or
intermediate
or
their
anything
else
profits
no
appeals
for
me
if
i
can
avoid
it
send
news
a
telegram
that
began
james
in
his
most
solemn
and
legal
tones
is
a
view
of
the
matter
in
which
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
heartily
coincide
although
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
several
points
which
i
will
touch
on
one
by
one
good
gracious
no
broke
in
lady
holmhurst
but
i
think
it
is
rather
of
them
do
you
mr
short
james
looked
puzzled
i
do
not
quite
take
lady
holmhurst
point
he
said
plaintively
then
you
must
be
stupid
said
eustace
do
you
see
the
joke
profits
of
them
ah
said
james
with
satisfaction
i
perceive
lady
holmhurst
does
not
seem
to
be
aware
that
although
a
totally
erroneous
word
is
pronounced
it
is
spelt
i
stand
corrected
said
lady
holmhurst
with
a
little
curtsey
i
thought
that
james
short
would
take
my
ignorance
into
account
and
understand
what
i
this
atrocious
pun
turned
the
laugh
against
the
learned
james
and
then
the
telegram
to
news
and
news
having
been
dispatched
they
all
went
in
to
the
wedding
breakfast
in
a
general
way
wedding
breakfasts
are
not
particularly
lively
affairs
there
is
a
mock
hilarity
about
them
that
does
not
tend
to
true
cheerfulness
and
those
of
the
guests
who
are
not
occupied
with
graver
thoughts
are
probably
thinking
of
the
dyspepsia
that
comes
after
but
this
particular
breakfast
was
an
exception
for
the
first
time
since
her
husband
unfortunate
death
lady
holmhurst
seemed
to
have
entirely
recovered
her
spirits
and
was
her
old
self
and
a
very
charming
self
it
was
so
charming
indeed
that
even
james
forgot
his
learning
and
the
responsibilities
of
his
noble
profession
and
talked
like
an
ordinary
christian
indeed
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
pay
her
an
elephantine
compliment
but
as
it
was
three
sentences
long
and
divided
into
points
it
shall
not
be
repeated
here
and
then
at
length
probate
rose
to
propose
the
bride
health
and
very
nicely
he
did
it
as
might
have
been
expected
from
a
man
with
his
extraordinary
familiarity
with
matrimonial
affairs
his
speech
was
quite
charming
and
aptly
sprinkled
with
classical
quotations
i
have
often
he
ended
heard
it
advanced
that
all
men
are
in
reality
equally
favoured
by
the
fates
in
their
passage
through
the
world
i
have
always
doubted
the
truth
of
that
assertion
and
now
i
am
convinced
of
its
falsity
eustace
is
a
very
excellent
young
man
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
a
very
young
man
but
what
i
would
ask
this
assembled
company
has
meeson
done
above
the
rest
of
men
to
justify
his
supreme
good
fortune
why
should
this
young
gentleman
be
picked
out
from
the
multitude
of
young
gentlemen
to
inherit
two
millions
of
money
and
to
marry
the
most
charming
yes
the
most
charming
the
most
talented
and
the
bravest
young
lady
that
i
have
ever
met
a
young
lady
who
not
only
carries
twenty
fortunes
on
her
face
but
another
fortune
in
her
brain
and
his
fortune
on
her
neck
and
such
a
fortune
too
sir
and
he
bowed
towards
eustace
thais
sits
beside
thee
take
the
goods
the
gods
provide
thee
i
salute
you
as
all
men
must
salute
one
so
supremely
favoured
humbly
i
salute
you
humbly
i
pray
that
you
may
continually
deserve
the
almost
unparalleled
good
that
it
has
pleased
providence
to
bestow
upon
you
and
then
eustace
rose
and
made
his
speech
and
a
very
good
speech
it
was
considering
the
trying
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made
he
told
them
how
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
augusta
sweet
face
the
very
first
time
that
he
had
set
eyes
upon
it
in
the
office
of
his
uncle
at
birmingham
he
told
them
what
he
had
felt
when
after
getting
some
work
in
london
he
had
returned
to
birmingham
to
find
his
flown
and
of
what
he
had
endured
when
he
heard
that
she
was
among
the
drowned
on
board
the
kangaroo
then
he
came
to
the
happy
day
of
the
return
and
to
that
still
happier
day
when
he
discovered
that
he
had
not
loved
her
in
vain
finally
ending
thus
probate
has
said
that
i
am
a
supremely
fortunate
man
and
i
admit
the
truth
of
his
remark
i
am
indeed
fortunate
above
my
deserts
so
fortunate
that
i
feel
afraid
when
i
turn
and
see
my
beloved
wife
sitting
at
my
side
i
feel
afraid
lest
i
should
after
all
be
dreaming
a
dream
and
awake
to
find
nothing
but
emptiness
and
then
on
the
other
hand
is
this
colossal
wealth
which
has
come
to
me
through
her
and
there
again
i
feel
afraid
but
please
heaven
i
hope
with
her
help
to
do
some
good
with
it
and
remembering
always
that
it
is
a
great
trust
that
has
been
placed
in
my
hands
and
she
also
is
a
trust
and
a
far
more
inestimable
one
and
as
i
deal
with
her
so
may
i
be
dealt
with
here
and
hereafter
then
by
an
afterthought
he
proposed
the
health
of
the
legal
twins
who
had
so
nobly
borne
the
brunt
of
the
affray
and
disconcerted
the
and
all
his
learned
host
thereon
james
rose
to
reply
in
terms
of
elephantine
eloquence
and
would
have
gone
through
the
whole
case
again
had
not
lady
holmhurst
in
despair
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
and
told
him
that
he
must
propose
her
health
which
he
did
with
sincerity
lightly
alluding
to
the
fact
that
she
was
a
widow
by
describing
her
as
being
in
a
discovert
condition
with
all
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
a
sole
everybody
burst
out
laughing
not
excepting
poor
lady
holmhurst
herself
and
james
sat
down
not
without
indignation
that
a
giddy
world
should
object
to
an
exact
and
legal
definition
of
the
status
of
the
individual
as
set
out
by
the
law
and
after
that
augusta
went
and
changed
her
dress
and
then
came
the
hurried
and
to
escape
observation
they
drove
off
in
a
hansom
cab
amidst
a
shower
of
old
shoes
and
there
in
that
hansom
cab
we
will
leave
them
chapter
xxiii
meeson
once
again
a
month
had
passed
a
month
of
long
summer
days
and
such
happiness
as
young
people
who
truly
love
each
other
can
get
out
of
a
honeymoon
spent
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
in
the
sweetest
sunniest
spots
of
the
channel
islands
and
now
the
curtain
draws
up
for
the
last
time
in
this
history
where
it
drew
up
for
the
first
in
the
inner
office
of
meeson
huge
establishment
during
the
last
fortnight
certain
communications
had
passed
between
john
short
being
duly
authorized
thereto
and
the
legal
representatives
of
addison
and
roscoe
with
the
result
that
the
interests
of
these
gentlemen
in
the
great
publishing
house
had
been
bought
up
and
that
eustace
meeson
was
now
the
sole
owner
of
the
vast
concern
which
he
intended
to
take
under
his
personal
supervision
now
accompanied
by
john
short
whom
he
had
appointed
to
the
post
of
his
solicitor
both
of
his
business
and
his
private
affairs
and
by
augusta
he
was
engaged
in
formally
taking
over
the
keys
from
the
head
manager
who
was
known
throughout
the
establishment
as
no
i
wish
to
refer
to
the
authors
agreements
of
the
early
part
of
last
year
said
eustace
no
produced
them
somewhat
sulkily
he
did
not
like
the
appearance
of
this
determined
young
owner
upon
the
scene
with
his
free
and
ways
eustace
turned
them
over
and
while
he
did
so
his
happy
wife
stood
by
him
marvelling
at
the
kaleidoscopic
changes
in
her
circumstances
when
last
she
had
stood
in
that
office
not
a
year
ago
it
had
been
as
a
pitiful
suppliant
begging
for
a
few
pounds
wherewith
to
try
and
save
her
sister
life
and
now
suddenly
eustace
stopped
turning
and
drawing
a
document
from
the
bundle
glanced
at
it
it
was
augusta
agreement
with
meeson
and
for
jemima
vow
the
agreement
binding
her
to
them
for
five
years
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
her
troubles
and
as
she
firmly
believed
of
her
little
sister
death
there
my
dear
said
eustace
to
his
wife
there
is
a
present
for
you
take
it
augusta
took
the
document
and
having
looked
to
see
what
it
was
shivered
as
she
did
so
it
brought
the
whole
thing
back
so
painfully
to
her
mind
what
shall
i
do
with
it
she
asked
tear
it
up
yes
he
answered
no
stop
a
bit
and
taking
it
from
her
he
wrote
cancelled
in
big
letters
across
it
signed
and
dated
it
there
he
said
now
send
it
to
be
framed
and
glazed
and
it
shall
be
hung
here
in
the
office
to
show
how
they
used
to
do
business
at
meeson
no
snorted
and
looked
at
eustace
aghast
what
would
the
young
man
be
after
next
are
the
gentlemen
assembled
in
the
hall
asked
eustace
of
him
when
the
remaining
documents
were
put
away
again
no
said
that
they
were
and
accordingly
to
the
hall
they
went
wherein
were
gathered
all
the
editors
managers
of
the
various
departments
clerks
and
other
employees
not
forgetting
the
tame
authors
who
a
pale
and
mealy
regiment
had
been
marched
up
thither
from
the
hutches
and
the
tame
artists
with
flying
hair
and
were
now
being
marshalled
in
lines
by
no
who
had
gone
on
before
when
eustace
and
his
wife
and
john
short
got
to
the
top
of
the
hall
where
some
chairs
had
been
set
the
whole
multitude
bowed
whereon
he
begged
them
to
be
seated
a
permission
of
which
the
tame
authors
who
sat
all
day
in
their
little
wooden
hutches
and
sometimes
a
good
part
of
the
night
also
did
not
seem
to
care
to
avail
themselves
of
but
the
tame
artists
who
had
for
the
most
part
to
work
standing
sat
down
readily
gentlemen
said
eustace
first
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
wife
meeson
who
in
another
capacity
has
already
been
not
greatly
to
her
own
profit
connected
with
this
establishment
having
written
the
best
work
of
fiction
that
has
ever
gone
through
our
here
some
of
the
wilder
spirits
cheered
and
augusta
blushed
and
bowed
and
who
will
i
hope
and
trust
write
many
even
better
books
which
we
shall
have
the
honour
of
giving
to
the
world
applause
also
gentlemen
let
me
introduce
you
to
john
short
my
solicitor
who
together
with
his
twin
brother
james
short
brought
the
great
lawsuit
in
which
i
was
engaged
to
a
successful
issue
and
now
i
have
to
tell
you
why
i
have
summoned
you
all
to
meet
me
here
first
of
all
to
say
that
i
am
now
the
sole
owner
of
this
business
having
bought
out
addison
and
roscoe
and
a
good
job
too
said
a
voice
and
that
i
hope
we
shall
work
well
together
and
secondly
to
inform
you
that
i
am
going
to
totally
revolutionise
the
course
of
business
as
hitherto
practised
in
this
establishment
sensation
having
with
the
assistance
of
short
drawn
up
a
scheme
for
that
purpose
i
am
informed
in
the
statement
of
profits
on
which
the
purchase
price
of
the
shares
of
addison
and
roscoe
was
calculated
that
the
average
net
profits
of
this
house
during
the
last
ten
years
have
amounted
to
and
a
fraction
per
cent
on
the
capital
invested
now
i
have
determined
that
in
future
the
net
profits
of
any
given
undertaking
shall
be
divided
as
follows
ten
per
cent
to
the
author
of
the
book
in
hand
and
ten
per
cent
to
the
house
then
should
there
be
any
further
profit
it
will
be
apportioned
thus
of
which
a
moiety
will
go
towards
a
pension
fund
to
the
employee
of
the
house
the
division
to
be
arranged
on
a
fixed
scale
enormous
sensation
especially
among
the
tame
authors
and
the
remainder
to
the
author
of
the
work
thus
supposing
that
a
book
paid
cent
per
cent
i
shall
take
ten
per
and
the
employees
would
take
and
a
fraction
per
cent
and
the
author
would
take
per
cent
and
here
an
interruption
occurred
it
came
from
no
who
could
no
longer
retain
his
disgust
i
resign
he
said
i
resign
meeson
content
with
ten
per
cent
and
expenses
when
an
author
a
mere
author
gets
sixty
it
shameful
shameful
if
you
choose
to
resign
you
can
said
eustace
sharply
but
i
advise
you
to
take
time
to
think
it
over
gentlemen
went
on
eustace
i
daresay
that
this
seems
a
great
change
to
you
but
i
may
as
well
say
at
once
that
i
am
no
wild
philanthropist
i
expect
to
make
it
pay
and
pay
well
to
begin
with
i
shall
never
undertake
any
work
that
i
do
not
think
will
pay
that
is
without
an
adequate
guarantee
or
in
the
capacity
of
a
simple
agent
and
my
own
ten
per
cent
will
be
the
first
charge
on
the
profits
then
the
author
ten
of
course
if
i
speculate
in
a
book
and
buy
it
out
and
out
subject
to
the
risks
the
case
will
be
different
but
with
a
net
ten
per
cent
certain
i
am
like
people
in
any
other
line
of
business
quite
prepared
to
be
satisfied
and
upon
those
terms
i
expect
to
become
the
publisher
of
all
the
best
writers
in
england
and
i
also
expect
that
any
good
writer
will
in
future
be
able
to
make
a
handsome
income
out
of
his
work
further
it
strikes
me
that
you
will
most
of
you
find
yourselves
better
off
at
the
end
of
the
year
than
you
do
at
present
cheers
one
or
two
more
matters
i
must
touch
on
first
and
foremost
the
hutches
which
i
consider
a
scandal
to
a
great
institution
like
this
will
be
abolished
shouts
of
joy
from
the
tame
authors
and
a
handsome
row
of
brick
chambers
erected
in
their
place
and
further
their
occupants
will
in
future
receive
a
very
permanent
addition
to
their
salaries
renewed
and
delirious
cheering
lastly
i
will
do
away
with
this
system
this
horrid
system
of
calling
men
by
numbers
as
though
they
were
convicts
instead
of
free
englishmen
henceforth
everybody
in
this
establishment
will
be
known
by
his
own
name
loud
cheers
and
now
one
more
thing
i
hope
to
see
you
all
at
dinner
at
pompadour
hall
this
day
next
week
when
we
will
christen
our
new
scheme
and
the
new
firm
which
however
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
will
be
known
as
meeson
for
as
we
are
all
to
share
in
the
profits
of
our
undertaking
i
consider
that
we
shall
still
be
a
company
and
i
hope
a
prosperous
and
an
honest
company
in
the
truest
sense
of
the
word
and
then
amidst
a
burst
of
prolonged
and
rapturous
cheering
eustace
and
his
wife
bowed
and
were
escorted
out
to
the
carriage
that
was
waiting
to
drive
them
to
pompadour
hall
in
time
they
were
the
palatial
gates
from
which
less
than
a
year
before
eustace
had
been
driven
forth
to
seek
his
fortune
there
on
either
side
were
drawn
up
the
long
lines
of
menials
gorgeous
with
plush
and
powder
for
meeson
servants
had
never
been
discharged
and
there
was
the
fat
butler
johnson
at
their
head
the
same
who
had
given
his
farewell
message
to
his
uncle
good
gracious
said
augusta
glancing
up
the
marble
steps
there
are
six
of
those
great
footmen
what
on
earth
shall
i
do
with
them
all
sack
them
said
eustace
abruptly
the
sight
of
those
overfed
brutes
makes
me
sick
and
then
they
were
bowed
in
and
under
the
close
scrutiny
of
many
pairs
of
eyes
wandered
off
with
what
dignity
they
could
command
to
dress
for
dinner
in
due
course
they
found
themselves
at
dinner
and
such
a
dinner
it
took
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
to
get
through
or
rather
the
six
footmen
took
an
hour
and
twenty
minutes
to
carry
the
silver
dishes
in
and
out
never
since
their
marriage
had
eustace
and
augusta
felt
so
miserable
i
do
think
that
i
like
being
so
rich
said
augusta
rising
and
coming
down
the
long
table
to
her
husband
when
at
last
johnson
had
softly
closed
the
door
it
oppresses
me
so
it
does
me
said
eustace
and
i
tell
you
what
it
is
gussie
he
went
on
putting
his
arm
round
her
i
wo
stand
having
all
these
infernal
fellows
hanging
round
me
i
shall
sell
this
place
and
go
in
for
something
quieter
and
at
that
moment
there
came
a
dreadful
diversion
suddenly
and
without
the
slightest
warning
the
doors
at
either
end
of
the
room
opened
through
the
one
came
two
enormous
footmen
laden
with
coffee
and
cream
and
through
the
other
johnson
and
another
powdered
monster
bearing
cognac
and
other
liquors
and
there
was
augusta
with
eustace
arm
round
her
absolutely
too
paralysed
to
stir
just
as
the
men
came
up
she
got
away
somehow
and
stood
looking
like
an
idiot
while
eustace
coloured
to
his
eyes
indeed
the
only
people
who
showed
no
confusion
were
those
magnificent
menials
who
never
turned
a
single
powdered
hair
but
went
through
their
solemn
rites
with
perfectly
unabashed
countenances
i
ca
stand
this
said
augusta
feebly
when
they
had
at
length
departed
i
am
going
to
bed
i
feel
quite
faint
all
right
said
eustace
i
think
that
it
is
the
best
thing
to
do
in
this
comfortless
shop
confound
that
fellow
short
why
could
he
come
and
dine
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
place
where
one
could
go
to
smoke
a
pipe
or
rather
a
cigar
i
suppose
those
fellows
would
despise
me
if
i
smoked
a
pipe
there
was
no
smoking
allowed
here
in
my
uncle
time
so
i
used
to
smoke
in
the
room
but
i
ca
do
that
now
why
do
you
smoke
here
the
room
is
so
big
it
would
not
smell
said
augusta
oh
hang
it
all
no
said
eustace
think
of
the
velvet
curtains
i
ca
sit
and
smoke
by
myself
in
a
room
fifty
feet
by
thirty
i
should
get
the
blues
no
i
shall
come
upstairs
too
and
smoke
there
and
he
did
early
very
early
in
the
morning
augusta
woke
got
up
and
put
on
a
the
light
was
streaming
through
the
rich
gold
cloth
curtains
some
of
which
she
had
drawn
it
lit
upon
the
ewers
made
of
solid
silver
on
the
fine
lace
hangings
of
the
bed
and
the
priceless
inlaid
furniture
and
played
round
the
faces
of
the
cupids
on
the
frescoed
ceiling
augusta
stared
at
it
all
and
then
thought
of
the
late
master
of
this
untold
magnificence
as
he
lay
dying
in
the
miserable
hut
in
kerguelen
land
what
a
contrast
was
here
eustace
she
said
to
her
sleeping
spouse
wake
up
i
want
to
say
something
to
you
eh
what
the
matter
said
eustace
yawning
eustace
we
are
too
rich
we
ought
to
do
something
with
all
this
money
all
right
said
eustace
i
agreeable
what
do
you
want
to
do
i
want
to
give
away
a
good
sum
say
two
hundred
thousand
that
is
much
out
of
all
you
have
to
found
an
institution
for
authors
all
right
said
eustace
only
you
must
see
about
it
i
ca
be
bothered
he
added
waking
up
a
little
you
remember
what
the
old
boy
told
you
when
he
was
dying
i
think
that
starving
authors
who
have
published
with
meeson
ought
to
have
the
first
right
of
election
i
think
so
too
said
augusta
and
she
went
to
the
buhl
to
work
out
that
scheme
on
paper
which
as
the
public
is
aware
is
now
about
to
prove
such
a
boon
to
the
world
of
scribblers
i
say
gussie
suddenly
said
her
husband
i
just
had
a
dream
well
she
said
sharply
for
she
was
busy
with
her
scheme
what
is
it
i
dreamt
that
james
short
was
a
and
making
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
that
he
had
married
lady
holmhurst
i
should
not
wonder
if
that
came
true
answered
augusta
biting
the
top
of
her
pen
then
came
another
pause
gussie
said
eustace
sleepily
are
you
quite
happy
yes
of
course
i
am
that
is
i
should
be
if
it
was
for
those
footmen
and
the
silver
i
wonder
at
that
said
her
husband
why
because
yawn
of
that
will
upon
your
neck
yawn
i
should
not
have
believed
that
a
woman
could
be
quite
happy
yawn
who
could
never
go
to
court
and
he
went
to
sleep
again
while
disdaining
reply
augusta
worked
on
the
end
