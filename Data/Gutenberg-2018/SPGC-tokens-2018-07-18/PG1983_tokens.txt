monsieur
beaucaire
by
booth
tarkington
chapter
one
the
young
frenchman
did
very
well
what
he
had
planned
to
do
his
guess
that
the
duke
would
cheat
proved
good
as
the
unshod
figures
that
had
been
standing
noiselessly
in
the
entryway
stole
softly
into
the
shadows
of
the
chamber
he
leaned
across
the
table
and
smilingly
plucked
a
card
out
of
the
big
englishman
sleeve
merci
le
duc
he
laughed
rising
and
stepping
back
from
the
table
the
englishman
cried
out
it
means
the
dirty
work
of
silencing
you
with
my
bare
hands
and
came
at
him
do
not
move
said
beaucaire
so
sharply
that
the
other
paused
observe
behind
the
englishman
turned
and
saw
what
trap
he
had
blundered
into
then
stood
transfixed
impotent
alternately
scarlet
with
rage
and
white
with
the
vital
shame
of
discovery
beaucaire
remarked
indicating
the
silent
figures
by
a
polite
wave
of
the
hand
is
it
not
a
compliment
to
monsieur
that
i
procure
six
large
men
to
subdue
him
they
are
quite
devote
to
me
and
monsieur
is
alone
could
it
be
that
he
did
not
wish
even
his
lackeys
to
know
he
play
with
the
frenchman
who
meestaire
nash
does
not
like
in
the
monsieur
is
unfortunate
to
have
come
on
foot
and
alone
to
my
the
duke
mouth
foamed
over
with
chaotic
revilement
his
captor
smiled
brightly
and
made
a
slight
gesture
as
one
who
brushes
aside
a
boisterous
insect
with
the
same
motion
he
quelled
to
stony
quiet
a
resentful
impetus
of
his
servants
toward
the
englishman
it
murder
is
it
you
carrion
finished
the
duke
beaucaire
lifted
his
shoulders
in
a
mock
shiver
what
words
no
no
no
no
killing
a
such
word
to
a
such
host
no
no
not
only
disgrace
he
laughed
a
clear
light
laugh
with
a
rising
inflection
seeming
to
launch
himself
upon
an
adventurous
quest
for
sympathy
you
little
devilish
scullion
spat
out
the
duke
tut
tut
but

forget

card
up

purple
of

with
a
sigh

and
looked
out
into
the
dark
he

the
lights
of
the
town
when

turned
again
he
had
half
forgotten
his
prisoner

those
people
up
over
the
sky

they
wish
the
earth
to
be
happy
so
they
smile
and

an
angel
of

a
diana
of
the
chase

her
fly
by
me
on

a
noble
of
france
your
own
protege
to
besiege
and
sack

less
of
divinity

not
the
fiber

heart
of
a
lady

a
blank

worl
chapter
two
the
chairmen
swarmed
in
the
street
at
lady
malbourne
door
where
the
joyous
vulgar
fought
with
muddied
footmen
and
tipsy
for
places
of
vantage
whence
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
quality
and
of
raiment
at
its
utmost
dawn
was
in
the
east
and
the
guests
were
departing
singly
or
in
pairs
glittering
in
finery
they
came
mincing
down
the
steps
the
ghost
of
the
night
smirk
fading
to
jadedness
as
they
sought
the
dark
recesses
of
their
chairs
from
within
sounded
the
twang
of
fiddles
still
swinging
manfully
at
it
and
the
windows
were
bright
with
the
light
of
many
candles
when
the
door
was
flung
open
to
call
the
chair
of
lady
mary
carlisle
there
was
an
eager
pressure
of
the
throng
to
see
a
small
fair
gentleman
in
white
satin
came
out
upon
the
steps
turned
and
bowed
before
a
lady
who
appeared
in
the
doorway
a
lady
whose
royal
loveliness
was
given
to
view
for
a
moment
in
that
glowing
frame
the
crowd
sent
up
a
hearty
english
cheer
for
the
beauty
of
bath
the
gentleman
smiled
upon
them
delightedly
what
enchanting
people
he
cried
why

i
not

i
might
have

with
them
the
lady
noticed
the
people
not
at
all
whereat
being
pleased
the
people
cheered
again
the
gentleman
offered
her
his
hand

made
a
slow
courtesy
placed
the
tips
of
her
fingers
upon
his
own
i
am
honored
de
chateaurien
she
said
no
no
he
cried
earnestly
behol
a
poor
frenchman
whom
emperors
should
then
reverently
and
with
the
pride
of
his
gallant
office
vibrant
in
every
line
of
his
slight
figure
invested
in
white
satin
and
very
grand
as
he
had
prophesied
le
duc
de
chateaurien
handed
lady
mary
carlisle
down
the
steps
an
achievement
which
had
figured
in
the
ambitions
of
seven
other
gentlemen
during
the
evening

i
to
be
such
onhappiness
he
said
in
a
low
voice
that

so
long
never
said
lady
mary

great
alms

chair

rose
he
whispered
her
beauty
shone
dazzlingly
on
him
out
of
the
dimness
never
she
flashed
defiantly
as
she
was
closed
in
never
never
the
rose

at
his
feet

a
voice
behind
him
turning
de
chateaurien
looked
beamingly
upon
the
face
of
the
duke
of
winterset
is
already
the
daylight
he
replied
pointing
to
the
east

chapter
three
it
was
well
agreed
by
the
fashion
of
bath
that
le
duc
de
chateaurien
was
a
person
of
sensibility
and
haut
ton
that
his
retinue
and
equipage
surpassed
in
elegance
that
his
person
was
exquisite
his
manner
engaging
in
the
company
of
gentlemen
his
ease
was
slightly
tinged
with
graciousness
his
single
equal
in
bath
being
his
grace
of
winterset
but
it
was
remarked
that
when
he
bowed
over
a
lady
hand
his
air
bespoke
only
a
gay
and
tender
reverence
he
was
the
idol
of
the
dowagers
within
a
week
after
his
appearance
matrons
warmed
to
him
young
belles
looked
sweetly
on
him
while
the
gentlemen
were
won
to
admiration
or
envy
he
was
of
prodigious
wealth
old
bicksit
who
dared
not
for
his
fame
sake
fail
to
have
seen
all
things
had
visited
chateaurien
under
the
present
duke
father
and
descanted
to
the
curious
upon
its
grandeurs
the
young
noble
had
one
fault
he
was
so
poor
a
gambler
he
cared
nothing
for
the
hazards
of
a
die
or
the
turn
of
a
card
gayly
admitting
that
he
had
been
born
with
no
spirit
of
adventure
in
him
he
was
sure
he
declared
that
he
failed
of
much
happiness
by
his
lack
of
taste
in
such
matters
but
he
was
not
long
wanting
the
occasion
to
prove
his
taste
in
the
matter
of
handling
a
weapon
a
certain
rohrer
by
name
notorious
amongst
other
things
for
bearing
a
dexterous
and
bloodthirsty
blade
came
to
bath
one
night
and
jostled
heartily
against
him
in
the
on
the
following
morning
de
chauteaurien
bowed
and
turned
aside
without
offense
continuing
a
conversation
with
some
gentlemen
near
by
captain
rohrer
jostled
against
him
a
second
time
de
chateaurien
looked
him
in
the
eye
and
apologized
pleasantly
for
being
so
much
in
the
way
thereupon
rohrer
procured
an
introduction
to
him
and
made
some
observations
derogatory
to
the
valor
and
virtue
of
the
french
there
was
current
a
curious
piece
of
gossip
of
the
french
court
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
grandson
of
the
late
regent
and
second
in
the
line
of
succession
to
the
throne
of
france
had
rebelled
against
the
authority
of
louis
xv
who
had
commanded
him
to
marry
the
princess
henriette
cousin
to
both
of
them
the
princess
was
reported
to
be
openly
devoted
to
the
cousin
who
refused
to
accept
her
hand
at
the
bidding
of
the
king
and
as
rumor
ran
the
prince
caprice
elected
in
preference
the
discipline
of
vincennes
to
which
retirement
the
furious
king
had
consigned
him
the
story
was
the
staple
gossip
of
all
polite
europe
and
captain
rohrer
having
in
his
mind
a
purpose
to
make
use
of
it
in
leading
up
to
a
statement
that
should
be
general
to
the
damage
of
all
frenchwomen
and
which
a
frenchman
might
not
pass
over
as
he
might
a
jog
of
the
elbow
repeated
it
with
garbled
truths
to
make
a
scandal
of
a
story
which
bore
none
on
a
plain
relation
he
did
not
reach
his
deduction
de
chateaurien
breaking
into
his
narrative
addressed
him
very
quietly
monsieur
he
said
none
but
swine
deny
the
nobleness
of
that
good
and
gentle
lady
mademoiselle
la
princesse
de
every
frenchman
know
that
her
cousin
is
a
bad
rebel
and
ingrate
who
had
only
honor
and
rispec
for
her
but
was
so
wilful
he
could
not
let
even
the
king
say
shall
marry
here
you
shall
marry
there
my
frien
the
young
man
turned
to
the
others
may
i
ask
you
to
close
roun
in
a
circle
for
one
moment
it
is
clearly
shown
that
the
duke
of
orleans
is
a
scurvy
fellow
but
not
he
wheeled
about
and
touched
captain
rohrer
on
the
brow
with
the
back
of
his
gloved
hand
but
not
so
scurvy
as
thou
thou
swine
of
the
gutter
two
hours
later
with
perfect
ease
he
ran
captain
rohrer
through
the
left
shoulder
after
which
he
sent
a
basket
of
red
roses
to
the
duke
of
winterset
in
a
few
days
he
had
another
captain
to
fight
this
was
a
ruffling
buck
who
had
the
astounding
indiscretion
to
proclaim
de
chateaurien
an
impostor
there
was
no
chateaurien
he
swore
the
frenchman
laughed
in
his
face
and
at
twilight
of
the
same
day
pinked
him
carefully
through
the
right
shoulder
it
was
not
that
he
could
not
put
aside
the
insult
to
himself
he
declared
to
molyneux
his
second
and
the
few
witnesses
as
he
handed
his
wet
sword
to
his
lackey
one
of
his
station
could
not
be
insulted
by
a
doubt
of
that
station
but
he
fought
in
the
quarrel
of
his
friend
winterset
this
rascal
had
asserted
that
le
duc
had
introduced
an
impostor
could
he
overlook
the
insult
to
a
friend
one
to
whom
he
owed
his
kind
reception
in
bath
then
bending
over
his
fallen
adversary
he
whispered
naughty
man
tell
your
master
find
some
better
quarrel
for
the
nex
he
agains
the
conduct
of
de
chateaurien
was
pronounced
admirable
there
was
no
surprise
when
the
young
foreigner
fell
naturally
into
the
long
train
of
followers
of
the
beautiful
lady
mary
carlisle
nor
was
there
great
astonishment
that
he
should
obtain
marked
favor
in
her
eyes
shown
so
plainly
that
my
lord
townbrake
sir
hugh
guilford
and
the
rich
squire
bantison
all
of
whom
had
followed
her
through
three
seasons
swore
with
rage
and
his
grace
of
winterset
stalked
from
her
house
with
black
brows
meeting
the
duke
there
on
the
evening
after
his
second
encounter
de
chateaurien
smiled
upon
him
brilliantly
it
was
badly
done
oh
so
badly
he
whispered
can
you
afford
to
have
me
strip
of
my
mask
by
any
but
yourself
you
who
introduce
me
they
will
say
there
is
some
bad
scandal
that
i
could
force
you
to
be
my
you
mus
get
the
courage
i
told
you
a
rose
had
a
short
life
was
the
answer
oh
those
roses
is
the
very
greates
rizzon
to
gather
each
day
a
fresh
he
took
a
red
bud
from
his
breast
for
an
instant
and
touched
it
to
his
lips
m
de
chateaurien
it
was
lady
mary
voice
she
stood
at
a
table
where
a
vacant
place
had
been
left
beside
her
m
de
chateaurien
we
have
been
waiting
very
long
for
the
duke
saw
the
look
she
did
not
know
she
gave
the
frenchman
and
he
lost
countenance
for
a
moment
we
approach
a
climax
eh
monsieur
said
de
chateaurien
chapter
four
there
fell
a
clear
september
night
when
the
moon
was
radiant
over
town
and
country
over
cobbled
streets
and
winding
roads
from
the
fields
the
mists
rose
slowly
and
the
air
was
mild
and
fragrant
while
distances
were
white
and
full
of
mystery
all
of
bath
that
pretended
to
fashion
or
condition
was
present
that
evening
at
a
fete
at
the
house
of
a
country
gentleman
of
the
neighborhood
when
the
stately
junket
was
concluded
it
was
the
pleasure
of
de
chateaurien
to
form
one
of
the
escort
of
lady
mary
carriage
for
the
return
as
they
took
the
road
sir
hugh
guilford
and
bantison
engaging
in
indistinct
but
vigorous
remonstrance
with
molyneux
over
some
matter
fell
fifty
or
more
paces
behind
where
they
continued
to
ride
keeping
up
their
argument
half
a
dozen
other
gallants
rode
in
advance
muttering
among
themselves
or
attended
laxly
upon
lady
mary
aunt
on
the
other
side
of
the
coach
while
the
happy
frenchman
was
permitted
to
ride
close
to
that
adorable
window
which
framed
the
fairest
face
in
england
he
sang
for
her
a
little
french
song
a
song
of
the
voyageur
who
dreamed
of
home
the
lady
listening
looking
up
at
the
bright
moon
felt
a
warm
drop
upon
her
cheek
and
he
saw
the
tears
sparkling
upon
her
lashes
mademoiselle
he
whispered
then
i
too
have
been
a
wanderer
but
my
dreams
were
not
of
france
no
i
do
not
dream
of
that
home
of
that
dear
country
it
is
of
a
dearer
country
a
dream
country
a
country
of
gold
and
snow
he
cried
softly
looking
it
her
white
brow
and
the
fair
lightly
powdered
hair
above
it
gold
and
snow
and
the
blue
sky
of
a
lady
eyes
i
had
thought
the
ladies
of
france
were
dark
sir
cruel
it
is
that
she
will
not
understan
have
i
speak
of
the
ladies
of
france
no
no
no
it
is
of
the
faires
country
yes
is
a
province
of
heaven
mademoiselle
do
i
not
renounce
my
allegiance
to
france
oh
yes
i
am
subjec
no
content
to
be
slave
in
the
lan
of
the
blue
sky
the
gold
and
the
snow
a
very
pretty
figure
answered
lady
mary
her
eyes
downcast
but
does
it
not
hint
a
notable
experience
in
the
making
of
such
speeches
tormentress
no
it
prove
only
the
inspiration
it
is
to
know
we
english
ladies
hear
plenty
of
the
like
sir
and
we
even
grow
brilliant
enough
to
detect
the
assurance
that
lies
beneath
the
courtesies
of
our
own
merci
i
should
believe
so
ejaculated
de
chateaurien
but
he
smothered
the
words
upon
his
lips
her
eyes
were
not
lifted
she
went
on
we
come
in
time
to
believe
that
true
feeling
comes
faltering
forth
not
glibly
that
smoothness
betokens
the
adept
in
the
art
sir
rather
than
your
true
your
true
she
was
herself
faltering
more
blushing
deeply
and
halting
to
a
full
stop
in
terror
of
a
word
there
was
a
silence
your
true
lover
he
said
huskily
when
he
had
said
that
word
both
trembled
she
turned
half
away
into
the
darkness
of
the
coach
i
know
what
make
you
to
doubt
me
he
said
faltering
himself
though
it
was
not
his
art
that
prompted
him
they
have
tol
you
the
french
do
nothing
always
but
make
love
is
it
not
so
yes
you
think
i
am
like
that
you
think
i
am
like
that
now
she
made
no
sign
i
suppose
he
sighed
i
am
i
would
have
the
snow
not
so
col
for
jus
she
did
not
answer
turn
to
me
he
said
the
fragrance
of
the
fields
came
to
them
and
from
the
distance
the
faint
clear
note
of
a
turn
to
the
lovely
head
was
bent
very
low
her
little
gloved
hand
lay
upon
the
narrow
window
ledge
he
laid
his
own
gently
upon
it
the
two
hands
were
shaking
like
twin
leaves
in
the
breeze
hers
was
not
drawn
away
after
a
pause
neither
knew
how
long
he
felt
the
warm
fingers
turn
and
clasp
themselves
tremulously
about
his
own
at
last
she
looked
up
bravely
and
met
his
eyes
the
horn
was
wound
again
nearer
all
the
cold
was
gone
from
the
snows
long
ago
she
said
my
beautiful
he
whispered
it
was
all
he
could
say
my
beautiful
but
she
clutched
his
arm
startled
the
road
a
wild
halloo
sounded
ahead
the
horn
wound
loudly
the
road
there
sprang
up
out
of
the
night
a
flying
thunder
of
the
gentlemen
riding
idly
in
front
of
the
coach
scattered
to
the
and
with
drawn
swords
flashing
in
the
moon
a
party
of
horsemen
charged
down
the
highway
their
cries
blasting
the
night
barber
kill
the
barber
they
screamed
barber
kill
the
barber
beaucaire
had
but
time
to
draw
his
sword
when
they
were
upon
him
a
moi
his
voice
rang
out
clearly
as
he
rose
in
his
stirrups
a
moi
francois
louis
berquin
a
moi
francois
the
cavaliers
came
straight
at
him
he
parried
the
thrust
of
the
first
but
the
shock
of
collision
hurled
his
horse
against
the
side
of
the
coach
sacred
swine
he
cried
bitterly
to
endanger
a
lady
to
make
this
brawl
in
a
lady
presence
drive
on
he
shouted
no
cried
lady

the
frenchman
assailants
were
masked
but
they
were
not
highwaymen

they
shouted
hoarsely
and
closed
in
on
him
in
a
circle
see
how
he
use
his
steel
laughed
beaucaire
as
his
point
passed
through
a
tawdry
waistcoat
for
a
moment
he
cut
through
the
ring
and
cleared
a
space
about
him
and
lady
mary
saw
his
face
shining
in
the
moonlight
canaille
he
hissed
as
his
horse
sank
beneath
him
and
though
guarding
his
head
from
the
rain
of
blows
from
above
he
managed
to
drag
headlong
from
his
saddle
the
man
who
had
hamstrung
the
poor
brute
the
fellow
came
suddenly
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
is
it
not
a
compliment
said
a
heavy
voice
to
bring
six
large
men
to
subdue

oh
you
are
there
my
frien
in
the
rear

little
in
the
rear
i
think
ha
ha
the
frenchman
play
with
his
weapon
was
a
revelation
of
skill
the
more
extraordinary
as
he
held
in
his
hand
only
a
light
dress
sword
but
the
ring
closed
about
him
and
his
keen
defense
could
not
avail
him
for
more
than
a
few
moments
lady
mary
outriders
the
gallants
of
her
escort
rode
up
close
to
the
coach
and
encircled
it
not
interfering
sir
hugh
guilford
cried
lady
mary
wildly
if
you
will
not
help
him
give
me
your
sword
she
would
have
leaped
to
the
ground
but
sir
hugh
held
the
door
sit
quiet
madam
he
said
to
her
then
to
the
man
on
the
box
drive
if
he
does
i
kill
him
she
said
fiercely
ah
what
cowards
will
you
see
the
duke
murdered
the
duke
laughed
guilford
they
will
not
kill
him
unless
be
easy
dear
madam
be
explained
gad
life
he
muttered
to
molyneux
time
the
varlet
had
his
lashing
d
hear
her
barber
or
no
barber
answered
molyneux
i
wish
i
had
warned
him
he
fights
as
few
gentlemen
could
ah
ah
look
at
that
is
a
shame
on
foot
his
hat
gone
his
white
coat
sadly
rent
and
gashed
flecked
too
with
red
beaucaire
wary
alert
brilliant
seemed
to
transform
himself
into
a
dozen
and
though
his
skill
appeared
to
lie
in
delicacy
and
quickness
his
play
being
continually
with
the
point
sheer
strength
failed
to
beat
him
down
the
young
man
was
laughing
like
a
child
believe
me
said
molyneux
he
no
barber
no
and
never
was
for
a
moment
there
was
even
a
chance
that
beaucaire
might
have
the
best
of
it
two
of
his
adversaries
were
prostrate
more
than
one
were
groaning
and
the
indomitable
frenchman
had
actually
almost
beat
off
the
ruffians
when
by
a
trick
he
was
overcome
one
of
them
dismounting
ran
in
suddenly
from
behind
and
seized
his
blade
in
a
thick
leather
gauntlet
before
beaucaire
could
disengage
the
weapon
two
others
threw
themselves
from
their
horses
and
hurled
him
to
the
earth
a
moi
a
moi
francois
he
cried
as
he
went
down
his
sword
in
fragments
but
his
voice
unbroken
and
clear
shame
muttered
one
or
two
of
the
gentlemen
about
the
coach
was
dastardly
to
take
him
so
said
molyneux
whatever
his
deservings
i
nigh
of
a
mind
to
offer
him
a
rescue
in
the
truss
him
up
lads
said
the
heavy
voice
clear
the
way
in
front
of
the
coach
there
sit
those
whom
we
avenge
upon
a
presumptuous
lackey
now
whiffen
you
have
a
fair
audience
lay
on
and
baste
two
men
began
to
drag
beaucaire
toward
a
great
oak
by
the
roadside
another
took
from
his
saddle
a
heavy
whip
with
three
thongs
a
moi
francois
there
was
borne
on
the
breeze
an
answer
monseigneur
monseigneur
the
cry
grew
louder
suddenly
the
clatter
of
hoofs
urged
to
an
anguish
of
speed
sounded
on
the
night
beaucaire
servants
had
lagged
sorely
behind
but
they
made
up
for
it
now
almost
before
the
noise
of
their
own
steeds
they
came
riding
down
the
moonlit
aisle
between
the
mists
chosen
men
these
servants
of
beaucaire
and
like
a
thunderbolt
they
fell
upon
the
astounded
cavaliers
chateaurien
chateaurien
they
shouted
and
smote
so
swiftly
that
through
lack
of
time
they
showed
no
proper
judgment
discriminating
nothing
between
and
their
master
foes
they
charged
first
into
the
group
about
beaucaire
and
broke
and
routed
it
utterly
two
of
them
leaped
to
the
young
man
side
while
the
other
four
swerving
scarce
losing
the
momentum
of
their
onset
bore
on
upon
the
gentlemen
near
the
coach
who
went
down
beneath
the
fierceness
of
the
onslaught
cursing
manfully
our
just
deserts
said
molyneux
his
mouth
full
of
dust
and
philosophy
sir
hugh
guilford
horse
fell
with
him
being
literally
ridden
over
and
the
baronet
leg
was
pinned
under
the
saddle
in
less
than
ten
minutes
from
the
first
attack
on
beaucaire
the
attacking
party
had
fled
in
disorder
and
the
patrician
choking
with
expletives
consumed
with
wrath
were
prisoners
disarmed
by
the
frenchman
lackeys
guilford
discomfiture
had
freed
the
doors
of
the
coach
so
it
was
that
when
beaucaire
struggling
to
rise
assisted
by
his
servants
threw
out
one
hand
to
balance
himself
he
found
it
seized
between
two
small
cold
palms
and
he
looked
into
two
warm
dilating
eyes
that
were
doubly
beautiful
because
of
the
fright
and
rage
that
found
room
in
them
too
le
duc
chateaurien
sprang
to
his
feet
without
the
aid
of
his
lackeys
and
bowed
low
before
lady
mary
i
make
ten
thousan
apology
to
be
the
cause
of
a
such
melee
in
your
presence
he
said
and
then
turning
to
francois
he
spoke
in
french
ah
thou
scoundrel
a
little
and
it
had
been
too
francois
knelt
in
the
dust
before
him
pardon
he
said
monseigneur
commanded
us
to
follow
far
in
the
rear
to
remain
unobserved
the
wind
malignantly
blew
against
monseigneur
see
what
it
might
have
cost
my
children
said
his
master
pointing
to
the
ropes
with
which
they
would
have
bound
him
and
to
the
whip
lying
beside
them
a
shudder
passed
over
the
lackey
frame
the
utter
horror
in
his
face
echoed
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellows
oh
monseigneur
francois
sprang
back
and
tossed
his
arms
to
heaven
but
it
did
not
happen
said
beaucaire
it
could
not
exclaimed
francois
no
and
you
did
very
well
my
children
the
young
man
smiled
benevolently
very
well
and
now
he
continued
turning
to
lady
mary
and
speaking
in
english
let
me
be
asking
of
our
gallants
yonder
what
make
them
to
be
in
cabal
with
highwaymen
one
should
come
to
a
polite
understanding
with
them
you
think
not
so
he
bowed
offering
his
hand
to
conduct
her
to
the
coach
where
molyneux
and
his
companions
having
drawn
sir
hugh
from
under
his
horse
were
engaged
in
reviving
and
reassuring
lady
rellerton
who
had
fainted
but
lady
mary
stayed
beaucaire
with
a
gesture
and
the
two
stood
where
they
were
monseigneur
she
said
with
a
note
of
raillery
in
her
voice
but
raillery
so
tender
that
he
started
with
happiness
his
movement
brought
him
a
hot
spasm
of
pain
and
he
clapped
his
hand
to
a
red
stain
on
his
waistcoat
you
are
hurt
it
is
nothing
smiled
beaucaire
then
that
she
might
not
see
the
stain
spreading
he
held
his
handkerchief
over
the
spot
i
am
a
little
but
jus
a
trifling
bruise
is
you
shall
ride
in
the
coach
she
whispered
will
you
be
pleased
de
chateaurien
ah
my
beautiful
she
seemed
to
wave
before
him
like
a
shining
mist
i
wish
that
ride
might
las
for
always
can
you
say
that
mademoiselle
monseigneur
she
cried
in
a
passion
of
admiration
i
would
what
you
would
have
be
should
be
what
do
you
not
deserve
you
are
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
ha
ha
i
am
jus
a
poor
would
that
a
few
englishmen
had
shown
themselves
as
tonight
the
vile
cowards
not
to
help
you
with
that
suddenly
possessed
by
her
anger
she
swept
away
from
him
to
the
coach
sir
hugh
groaning
loudly
was
being
assisted
into
the
vehicle
my
little
poltroons
she
said
what
are
you
doing
with
your
sir
hugh
guilford
there
madam
replied
molyneux
humbly
sir
hugh
leg

broken
lady
rellerton
graciously
permits
him
to
be
taken
i
do
not
permit
it
de
chateaurien

sir
leave
the
wretch
to
groan
by
the
roadside
she
cried
fiercely
which
plight
i
would
were
that
of
all
of
you
but
there
will
be
a
pretty
story
for
the
gossips
and
i
could
almost
find
pity
for
you
when
i
think
of
the
wits
when
you
return
to
town
fine
gentlemen
you
hardy
bravos
by
heaven
to
leave
one
man
to
meet
a
troop
of
horse
while
you
huddle
in
shelter
until
you
are
overthrown
and
disarmed
by
servants
oh

wits
heaven

the
wits

more
de
chateaurien
lady
rellerton
and
i
will
greatly
esteem
the
honor
of
your
company
will
you
come
she
stepped
quickly
into
the
coach
and
was
gathering
her
skirts
to
make
room
for
the
frenchman
when
a
heavy
voice
spoke
from
the
shadows
of
the
tree
by
the
wayside
lady
mary
carlisle
will
no
doubt
listen
to
a
word
of
counsel
on
this
the
duke
of
winterset
rode
out
into
the
moonlight
composedly
untieing
a
mask
from
about
his
head
he
had
not
shared
the
flight
of
his
followers
but
had
retired
into
the
shade
of
the
oak
whence
he
now
made
his
presence
known
with
the
utmost
coolness
gracious
heavens

winterset
exclaimed
lady
rellerton
turned
highwayman
and
cried
lady
mary
no

laughed
beaucaire
somewhat
unsteadily
as
he
stood
swaying
a
little
with
one
hand
on
the
the
other
pressed
hard
on
his
side
he
only
oversee

explanation
or
an
attack
on
my
friend
and
on

carriage

to
my
alas
that

was
not
here
said
the
duke
to
aid
me
madam
was
your
carriage
threatened
i
have
endeavored
only
to
expunge
a
debt
i
owed
to
bath
and
to
avenge
an
insult
offered
to
yourself
through
sir
sir
my
patience
will
bear
little
more
a
thousan
apology
said
beaucaire
you
will
listen
i
only
beg
lady
mary
she
made
an
angry
gesture
of
assent
madam
i
will
be
brief
as
i
may
two
months
ago
there
came
to
bath
a
french
gambler
calling
himself
beaucaire
a
desperate
fellow
with
the
cards
or
dice
and
all
the
men
of
fashion
went
to
play
at
his
lodging
where
he
won
considerable
sums
he
was
small
wore
a
black
wig
and
mustachio
he
had
the
insolence
to
show
himself
everywhere
until
the
master
of
ceremonies
rebuffed
him
in
the
as
you
know
and
after
that
he
forbore
his
visits
to
the
rooms
nash
explained
and
was
confirmed
madam
by
indubitable
information
that
this
beaucaire
was
a
man
of
unspeakable
vile
low
birth
being
in
fact
no
other
than
a
lackey
of
the
french
king
ambassador
victor
by
name
de
barber
although
his
condition
was
known
the
hideous
impudence
of
the
fellow
did
not
desert
him
and
he
remained
in
bath
where
none
would
speak
to
is
your
farrago
nigh
done
sir
a
few
moments
madam
one
evening
three
weeks
gone
i
observed
a
very
elegant
equipage
draw
up
to
my
door
and
the
duke
of
chateaurien
was
announced
the
young
man
manners
were
worthy
according
to
the
french
acceptance
and
idle
to
deny
him
the
most
monstrous
assurance
he
declared
himself
a
noble
traveling
for
pleasure
he
had
taken
lodgings
in
bath
for
a
season
he
said
and
called
at
once
to
pay
his
respects
to
me
his
tone
was
so
candid
in
truth
i
am
the
simplest
of
men
very
easily
gulled
and
his
stroke
so
bold
that
i
did
not
for
one
moment
suspect
him
and
to
my
poignant
regret
though
in
the
humblest
spirit
i
have
shown
myself
eager
to
atone
that
very
evening
i
had
the
shame
of
presenting
him
to
the
shame
sir
have
patience
pray
madam
ay
the
shame
you
know
what
figure
he
hath
cut
in
bath
since
that
evening
all
ran
merrily
with
him
until
several
days
ago
captain
badger
denounced
him
as
an
impostor
vowing
that
chateaurien
was
pardon
interrupted
beaucaire
nowhere
would
have
been
so
much
better
why
did
you
not
make
him
say
it
that
way
monsieur
lady
mary
started
she
was
looking
at
the
duke
and
her
face
was
white
he
continued
poor
captain
badger
was
stabbed
that
same
most
befitting
poor
captain
badger
muttered
molyneux
and
his
adversary
had
the
marvelous
insolence
to
declare
that
he
fought
in
my
quarrel
this
afternoon
the
wounded
man
sent
for
me
and
imparted
a
very
horrifying
intelligence
he
had
discovered
a
lackey
whom
he
had
seen
waiting
upon
beaucaire
in
attendance
at
the
door
of
this
chateaurien
lodging
beaucaire
had
disappeared
the
day
before
chateaurien
arrival
captain
badger
looked
closely
at
chateaurien
at
their
next
meeting
and
identified
him
with
the
missing
beaucaire
beyond
the
faintest
doubt
overcome
with
indignation
he
immediately
proclaimed
the
impostor
out
of
regard
for
me
he
did
not
charge
him
with
being
beaucaire
the
poor
soul
was
unwilling
to
put
upon
me
the
humiliation
of
having
introduced
a
barber
but
the
secret
weighed
upon
him
till
he
sent
for
me
and
put
everything
in
my
hands
i
accepted
the
odium
thinking
only
of
atonement
i
went
to
sir
john
wimpledon
i
took
poor
sir
hugh
there
and
these
other
gentlemen
aside
and
told
them
my
news
we
narrowly
observed
this
man
and
were
shocked
at
our
simplicity
in
not
having
discovered
him
before
these
are
men
of
honor
and
cool
judgment
madam
molyneux
had
acted
for
him
in
the
affair
of
captain
badger
and
was
strongly
prejudiced
in
his
favor
but
molyneux
sir
hugh
bantison
every
one
of
them
in
short
recognized
him
in
spite
of
his
smooth
face
and
his
light
hair
the
adventurer
beaucaire
was
writ
upon
him
amazing
plain
look
at
him
madam
if
he
will
dare
the
inspection
you
saw
this
beaucaire
well
the
day
of
his
expulsion
from
the
rooms
is
not
this
he
beaucaire
stepped
close
to
her
her
pale
face
twitched
look
he
said
oh
oh
she
whispered
with
a
dry
throat
and
fell
back
in
the
carriage
is
it
so
cried
the
duke
i
do
not
i
can
not
one
moment
more
i
begged
these
gentlemen
to
allow
me
to
wipe
out
the
insult
i
had
unhappily
offered
to
bath
but
particularly
to
you
they
agreed
not
to
forestall
me
or
to
interfere
i
left
sir
john
early
and
arranged
to
give
the
sorry
rascal
a
lashing
under
your
own
eyes
a
satisfaction
due
the
lady
into
whose
presence
he
had
dared
to
force
oblige
said
beaucaire
in
a
tone
of
gentle
inquiry
and
now
madam
said
the
duke
i
will
detain
you
not
one
second
longer
i
plead
the
good
purpose
of
my
intentions
begging
you
to
believe
that
the
desire
to
avenge
a
hateful
outrage
next
to
the
wish
to
serve
you
forms
the
dearest
motive
in
the
heart
of
bravo
cried
beaucaire
softly
lady
mary
leaned
toward
him
a
thriving
terror
in
her
eyes
it
is
false
she
faltered
monsieur
should
not
have
been
born
so
high
he
could
have
made
little
you
mean
it
is
false
she
cried
breathlessly
blood
is
she
not
convinced
broke
out
bantison
fellow
were
you
not
the
ambassador
barber
it
is
all
false
she
whispered
the
mos
fine
art
mademoiselle
how
long
you
think
it
take
de
winterset
to
learn
that
speech
after
he
write
it
out
it
is
a
mix
of
what
is
true
and
the
mos
chaste
art
monsieur
has
become
a
man
of
letters
perhaps
he
may
enjoy
that
more
than
the
wars
ha
ha
bantison
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
do
french
gentlemen
fight
lackeys
ho

on

followed
the

with
his

as
the
noise
of

wheels
and
the
of
the
accompanying
cavalcade
grew
fainter
in

beau
nash
stood
at
the
door
of
the
rooms
smiling
blandly
upon
a
dainty
throng
in
the
pink
of
its
finery
and
gay
furbelows
the
great
exquisite
bent
his
body
constantly
in
a
series
of
consummately
adjusted
bows
before
a
great
dowager
seeming
to
sweep
the
floor
in
august
deference
somewhat
stately
to
the
young
bucks
greeting
the
wits
with
gracious
friendliness
and
a
twinkle
of
raillery
inclining
with
fatherly
gallantry
before
the
beauties
the
degree
of
his
inclination
measured
the
altitude
of
the
recipient
as
accurately
as
a
nicely
calculated
measures
the

the

was

for

to
speak
more
concretely

ran
higher
and
higher
and
nash
coffers
filled
up
with
gold
to
crown
his
pleasure
a
prince
of
the
french
blood
the
young
comte
de
beaujolais
just
arrived
from
paris
had
reached
bath
at
noon
in
state
accompanied
by
the
marquis
de
mirepoix
the
ambassador
of
louis
xv
the
beau
dearly
prized
the
society
of
the
lofty
and
the
present
visit
was
an
honor
to
bath
hence
to
the
master
of
ceremonies
what
was
better
there
would
be
some
profitable
hours
with
the
cards
and
dice
so
it
was
that
nash
smiled
never
more
benignly
than
on
that
bright
evening
the
rooms
rang
with
the
silvery
voices
of
women
and
delightful
laughter
while
the
fiddles
went
merrily
their
melodies
chiming
sweetly
with
the
joyance
of
his
mood
the
skill
and
brazen
effrontery
of
the
ambassador
scoundrelly
servant
in
passing
himself
off
for
a
man
of
condition
formed
the
point
of
departure
for
every
conversation
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
but
three
persons
present
who
had
not
suspected
him
from
the
first
and
by
a
singular
paradox
the
most
astute
of
all
proved
to
be
old
bicksit
the
traveler
once
a
visitor
at
chateaurien
for
he
according
to
report
had
by
a
coup
of
diplomacy
entrapped
the
impostor
into
an
admission
that
there
was
no
such
place
however
like
poor
captain
badger
the
worthy
old
man
had
held
his
peace
out
of
regard
for
the
duke
of
winterset
this
nobleman
heretofore
secretly
disliked
suspected
of
irregular
devices
at
play
and
never
admired
had
won
admiration
and
popularity
by
his
remorse
for
the
mistake
and
by
the
modesty
of
his
attitude
in
endeavoring
to
atone
for
it
without
presuming
upon
the
privilege
of
his
rank
to
laugh
at
the
indignation
of
society
an
action
the
more
praiseworthy
because
his
exposure
of
the
impostor
entailed
the
disclosure
of
his
own
culpability
in
having
stood
the
villain
sponsor
the
happy
gentleman
with
lady
mary
carlisle
upon
his
arm
went
grandly
about
the
rooms
sowing
and
reaping
a
harvest
of
smiles
was
said
work
would
be
begun
at
once
to
rebuild
the

country
seat
while
several
ruined
jews
might
be
paid
out
of

people
gazing
on
the
beauty
and
the
stately
but
modest
hero
by
her
side
said
they
would
make
a
noble
pair
she
had
long
been
distinguished
by
his
attentions
and
he
had
come
brilliantly
out
of
the
episode
of
the
frenchman
who
had
been
his
only
real
rival
wherever
they
went
there
arose
a
buzz
of
pleasing
gossip
and
adulation
nash
seeing
them
near
him
came
forward
with
greetings
a
word
on
the
side
passed
between
the
nobleman
and
the
exquisite
i
had
news
of
the
rascal
tonight
whispered
nash
he
lay
at
a
farm
till
yesterday
when
he
disappeared
his
ruffians

watching

could
not
come
within
gunshot
if
they
clap
eyes
on
him
they
will
hustle
him
to
jail
and
his
cutthroats
shall
not
avail
him

the
impertinent

to
see
if
they
have
taken
the
beau
beckoned
an
attendant
and
whispered
in
his
ear
many
of
the
crowd
had
edged
up
to
the
two
gentlemen
with
apparent
carelessness
to
overhear
their
conversation
those
who
did
overhear
repeated
it
in
covert
asides
and
this
circulating
undertone
confirming
a
vague
rumor
that
beaucaire
would
attempt
the
entrance
that
night
lent
a
pleasurable
color
of
excitement
to
the
evening
the
french
prince
the
ambassador
and
their
suites
were
announced
polite
as
the
assembly
was
it
was
also
curious
and
there
occurred
a
mannerly
rush
to
see
the
newcomers
lady
mary
already
pale
grew
whiter
as
the
throng
closed
round
her
she
looked
up
pathetically
at
the
duke
who
lost
no
time
in
extricating
her
from
the
pressure
wait
here
he
said
i
will
fetch
you
a
glass
of
negus
and
disappeared
he
had
not
thought
to
bring
a
chair
and
she
looking
about
with
an
increasing
faintness
and
finding
none
saw
that
she
was
standing
by
the
door
of
a
small
the
crowd
swerved
back
for
the
passage
of
the
legate
of
france
and
pressed
upon
her
she
opened
the
door
and
went
in
the
room

empty
save
for
two
gentlemen
who
were
quietly
playing
cards
at
a
table
they
looked
up
as
she
entered
they
were
beaucaire
and
molyneux
she
uttered
a
quick
cry
and
leaned
against
the
wall
her
hand
to
her
breast
beaucaire
though
white
and
weak
had
brought
her
a
chair
before
molyneux
could
stir
mademoiselle

she
said
with
such
frozen
abhorrence
in
her
voice
that
he
stopped
short

molyneux

strange
company

replied
molyneux
bowing
deeply
as
much
to
beaucaire

of

she
exclaimed
contemptuously

respects
to
the
young

he
discovered
to
be
a
stripling
of
seventeen
arrogant
looking
but
pretty
as
a
girl
standing
beside
the
marquis
de

a
man
of
quiet
bearing
he
was
surrounded
by
a
group
of
the
great
among
whom
nash
naturally
counted
himself
the
beau
was
felicitating
himself
that
the
foreigners
had
not
arrived
a
week
earlier
in

i
wish

shared
my
masque
i
have
been
so
gay
the
surface
of
his
tone
was
merry
but
there
was
an
undercurrent
weary
sad
to
speak
of
what
was
the
mood
not
the
manner
he
made
the
effect
of
addressing
every
one
present
but
he
looked
steadily
at
lady
mary
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
with
a
silent
and
frightened
fascination
and
she
trembled
more
and
more
i

a
great
actor

one
evening
i

true
there

not
a
peasant
in
france
who
would
not
have
then
known
one
but
they
are
wonderful
this
english
people
holding
by
an
idea
once
it
is
in
their
heads
a
mos
worthy
quality
but
my
good
molyneux
here
he
had
speak
to
me
with
courtesy
jus
because
i
am
a
man
an
jus
because

i
sen
to
him

good
and
accomplish
lady
very
noble
and
very
beautiful

the
young
count
at

himself
in
a
mantle
of
solemn
thought

hum
of
voices
and
over

the
fiddles

a
wandering
air
a
sweet
french
song
of

voyageur
