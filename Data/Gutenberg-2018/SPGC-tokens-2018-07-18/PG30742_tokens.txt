anything
you
can
do
first
of
two
parts
the
alien
was
alien
and
earth
was
faced
with
a
strange
problem
indeed
they
to
have
a
superman
and
there
were
any
so
by
darrell
langart
illustrated
by
leone
i
like
some
great
fish
the
ship
sang
on
through
the
eternal
night
there
was
no
impression
of
swimming
the
fish
shape
had
neither
fins
nor
a
tail
it
was
as
though
it
were
hovering
in
wait
for
a
member
of
some
smaller
species
to
swoop
suddenly
down
from
nowhere
so
that
it
in
turn
could
pounce
and
kill
but
still
it
moved
only
a
being
who
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
type
could
have
told
that
this
fish
was
dying
illustration
in
shape
the
ship
was
rather
like
a
narrow
flounder
long
tapered
and
oval
in
but
it
showed
none
of
the
exterior
markings
one
might
expect
of
either
a
living
thing
or
of
a
spaceship
with
one
exception
the
smooth
exterior
was
featureless
that
one
exception
was
a
long
roughened
discoloration
that
ran
along
one
side
for
almost
half
of
the
ship
seventeen
meters
of
length
it
was
the
only
external
sign
that
the
ship
was
dying
inside
the
ship
the
nipe
neither
knew
nor
cared
about
the
discoloration
had
he
thought
about
it
he
would
have
deduced
the
presence
of
the
burn
but
it
was
the
least
of
his
worries
the
internal
damage
that
had
been
done
to
the
ship
was
by
far
the
more
serious
it
could
quite
possibly
kill
him
the
nipe
of
course
had
no
intention
of
dying
not
out
here
not
so
far
so
very
far
from
his
own
people
not
out
here
where
his
death
would
be
so
very
improper
he
looked
at
the
ball
of
the
sun
ahead
and
wondered
that
such
a
relatively
stable
inactive
star
could
have
produced
such
a
tremendously
energetic
plasmoid
that
it
could
still
do
the
damage
it
had
done
so
far
out
it
had
been
a
freak
of
course
such
suns
as
this
did
not
normally
produce
such
energetic
swirls
of
magnetic
force
but
the
thing
had
been
there
nonetheless
and
the
ship
had
hit
it
at
high
velocity
fortunately
the
ship
had
only
touched
the
edge
of
the
swirling
cloud
otherwise
the
entire
ship
would
have
vanished
in
a
puff
of
incandescence
but
it
had
done
enough
the
power
plants
that
drove
the
ship
at
ultralight
velocities
through
the
depths
of
interstellar
space
had
been
so
badly
damaged
that
they
could
only
be
used
in
short
bursts
and
each
burst
brought
them
nearer
to
the
fusion
point
most
of
the
instruments
were
powerless
the
nipe
was
not
even
sure
he
could
land
the
vessel
any
attempt
to
use
the
communicator
to
call
home
would
have
blown
the
ship
to
atoms
the
nipe
did
not
want
to
die
but
if
die
he
must
he
did
not
want
to
die
foolishly
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
drift
in
from
the
outer
reaches
of
this
planetary
system
but
using
the
power
plants
any
more
than
absolutely
necessary
would
have
been
the
nipe
missed
the
companionship
his
brother
had
given
him
for
so
long
his
help
would
be
invaluable
now
but
there
had
been
no
choice
there
had
not
been
enough
supplies
for
two
to
survive
the
long
fall
inward
toward
the
distant
sun
the
nipe
having
discovered
the
fact
first
had
out
of
his
mercy
and
compassion
killed
his
brother
while
the
other
was
not
looking
then
having
eaten
his
brother
with
all
due
ceremony
he
had
settled
down
to
the
long
lonely
wait
beings
of
another
race
might
have
cursed
the
accident
that
had
disabled
the
ship
or
regretted
the
necessity
that
one
of
them
should
die
but
the
nipe
did
neither
for
to
him
the
first
notion
would
have
been
foolish
and
the
second
incomprehensible
but
now
as
the
ship
fell
ever
closer
toward
the
sun
he
began
to
worry
about
his
own
fate
for
a
while
it
had
seemed
almost
certain
that
he
would
survive
long
enough
to
build
a
communicator
for
the
instruments
had
already
told
him
and
his
brother
that
the
system
ahead
was
inhabited
by
creatures
of
reasoning
power
if
not
true
intelligence
and
it
would
almost
certainly
be
possible
to
get
the
equipment
he
needed
for
them
now
though
it
looked
as
if
the
ship
would
not
survive
a
landing
he
had
had
to
steer
it
away
from
a
great
gas
giant
which
had
seriously
endangered
the
power
plants
he
did
not
want
to
die
in
space
wasted
forever
undevoured
at
least
he
must
die
on
a
planet
where
there
might
be
creatures
with
the
compassion
and
wisdom
to
give
his
body
the
proper
ingestion
the
thought
of
feeding
inferior
creatures
was
repugnant
but
it
was
better
than
rotting
to
feed
monocells
or
ectogenes
and
far
superior
to
wasting
away
in
space
even
thoughts
such
as
these
did
not
occupy
his
mind
often
or
for
very
long
far
far
better
than
any
of
them
was
the
desire
and
planning
for
survival
the
outer
orbits
of
the
gas
giants
had
been
passed
at
last
and
the
nipe
fell
on
through
the
asteroid
belt
without
approaching
any
of
the
larger
pieces
of
that
he
and
his
brother
had
originally
elected
to
come
into
this
system
along
its
orbital
plane
had
been
a
mixed
blessing
to
have
come
in
at
a
different
angle
would
have
avoided
all
the
debris
from
planetary
size
on
down
that
is
thickest
in
a
equatorial
plane
but
it
would
also
have
meant
a
greater
chance
of
missing
a
suitable
planet
unless
too
much
reliance
were
placed
on
the
already
weakened
power
generators
as
it
was
the
nipe
had
been
able
to
use
the
gravitational
field
of
the
gas
giant
to
swing
his
ship
toward
the
precise
spot
where
the
third
planet
would
be
when
the
ship
arrived
in
the
third
orbit
moreover
the
third
planet
would
be
retreating
from
the
nipe
line
of
flight
which
would
make
the
velocity
difference
that
much
the
less
for
a
while
the
nipe
had
toyed
with
the
idea
of
using
the
mining
bases
that
the
local
life
form
had
set
up
in
the
asteroid
belt
as
bases
for
his
own
operations
but
he
had
decided
against
it
movement
would
be
much
freer
and
much
more
productive
on
a
planet
than
it
would
be
in
the
belt
he
would
have
preferred
using
the
fourth
planet
for
his
base
although
much
smaller
it
had
the
same
reddish
arid
look
as
his
own
home
planet
while
the
third
world
was
drowned
in
water
but
there
were
two
factors
that
weighed
so
heavily
against
that
choice
that
they
rendered
it
impossible
in
the
first
place
by
far
the
greater
proportion
of
the
local
inhabitants
commerce
was
between
the
asteroids
and
the
third
planet
second
and
much
more
important
the
fourth
world
was
at
such
a
point
in
her
orbit
that
the
energy
required
to
land
would
destroy
the
ship
beyond
any
doubt
it
would
have
to
be
the
third
world
as
the
ship
fell
inward
the
nipe
watched
his
pitifully
inadequate
instruments
doing
his
best
to
keep
tabs
on
every
one
of
the
ships
that
the
local
life
form
used
to
move
through
space
he
did
not
want
to
be
spotted
now
and
even
though
the
odds
were
against
these
beings
having
any
instrument
highly
developed
enough
to
spot
his
craft
there
was
always
the
possibility
that
he
might
be
observed
optically
so
he
squatted
there
in
the
ship
a
thing
about
five
feet
in
length
and
a
little
less
than
eighteen
inches
in
diameter
with
eight
articulated
limbs
spaced
in
pairs
along
his
body
any
one
of
which
could
be
used
as
hand
or
foot
his
head
which
was
long
and
snouted
displayed
two
pairs
of
violet
eyes
which
kept
a
constant
watch
on
the
indicators
and
screens
of
the
few
instruments
that
were
still
functioning
aboard
the
ship
and
he
waited
as
the
ship
fell
towards
its
rendezvous
with
the
third
planet
ii
wang
kulichenko
pulled
the
collar
of
his
uniform
coat
up
closer
around
his
ears
and
pulled
the
helmet
and
down
a
bit
it
was
only
early
october
but
here
in
the
tundra
country
the
wind
had
a
tendency
to
be
chill
and
biting
in
the
morning
even
at
this
time
of
year
within
a
week
or
so
he
have
to
start
using
the
power
pack
on
his
horse
to
electrically
warm
his
protective
clothing
and
the
horse
wrappings
but
there
was
no
necessity
of
that
yet
he
smiled
a
little
as
he
always
did
when
he
thought
of
his
grandfather
remarks
about
such
nonsense
your
ancestors
son
of
my
son
he
would
say
conquered
the
tundra
and
lived
upon
it
for
thousands
of
years
without
the
need
of
such
womanish
things
are
there
no
men
anymore
are
there
none
who
can
face
nature
alone
and
unafraid
without
the
aid
of
artifices
that
bring
softness
but
wang
kulichenko
noticed
though
out
of
politeness
he
never
pointed
it
out
that
the
old
man
never
failed
to
take
advantage
of
the
electric
warmth
of
the
house
when
the
short
days
came
and
the
snow
blew
across
the
country
like
fine
white
sand
and
he
never
complained
about
the
lights
or
the
television
or
the
hot
water
except
to
grumble
occasionally
that
they
were
a
little
old
and
out
of
date
and
that
the
catalog
showed
that
better
models
were
available
in
vladivostok
and
wang
would
remind
the
old
man
very
gently
that
a
ranger
made
only
so
much
money
and
that
there
would
have
to
be
more
saving
before
such
things
could
be
bought
he
did
not
remind
the
old
man
that
he
wang
was
stretching
a
point
to
keep
his
grandfather
on
the
payroll
as
an
assistant
wang
kulichenko
patted
his
horse
rump
and
urged
her
softly
to
step
up
her
pace
just
a
bit
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
territory
to
cover
and
although
he
wanted
to
be
careful
in
his
checking
he
also
wanted
to
get
home
early
around
him
the
forest
of
spread
knotty
alien
branches
trying
to
catch
the
rays
of
the
sun
whenever
wang
thought
of
his
grandfather
remarks
about
his
ancestors
he
always
wondered
as
a
corollary
what
those
same
ancestors
would
have
thought
about
a
forest
growing
up
here
where
no
forest
like
this
one
had
ever
grown
before
they
were
called
because
the
bulk
of
their
pulp
was
used
to
make
paper
they
were
of
no
use
whatever
as
lumber
but
they
trees
really
and
the
organic
chemicals
that
were
leached
from
them
during
the
pulping
process
were
of
far
more
value
than
the
paper
pulp
they
were
mutations
of
a
smaller
plant
that
had
been
found
in
the
temperate
regions
of
mars
and
purposely
changed
genetically
to
grow
on
the
siberian
tundra
where
the
conditions
were
similar
to
but
superior
to
their
natural
habitat
they
looked
as
though
someone
had
managed
to
cross
breed
the
joshua
tree
with
the
cypress
and
then
persuaded
the
result
to
grow
grass
instead
of
leaves
in
the
distance
wang
heard
the
whining
of
the
wind
and
he
automatically
pulled
his
coat
a
little
tighter
even
though
he
noticed
no
increase
in
the
wind
velocity
around
him
then
as
the
whine
became
louder
he
realized
that
it
was
not
the
wind
he
turned
his
head
toward
the
noise
and
looked
up
for
a
long
minute
he
watched
the
sky
as
the
sound
gained
volume
but
he
could
see
nothing
at
first
then
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
motion
a
dot
that
was
hard
to
distinguish
against
the
gray
sky
what
was
it
an
air
transport
in
trouble
there
were
two
routes
that
passed
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
here
but
no
air
transport
he
had
ever
seen
had
made
a
noise
like
that
normally
they
were
so
high
as
to
be
both
invisible
and
inaudible
must
be
trouble
of
some
sort
he
reached
down
to
the
saddle
pack
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
moving
speck
and
took
out
the
radiophone
he
held
it
to
his
ear
and
thumbed
the
call
button
insistently
he
thought
with
growing
irritation
as
the
seconds
passed
up
come
on
old
dozer
rouse
yourself
from
your
dreams
at
the
same
time
he
checked
his
wrist
compass
and
estimated
the
direction
of
flight
of
the
dot
and
its
direction
from
him
he
at
least
be
able
to
give
the
airline
authorities
some
information
if
the
ship
fell
he
wished
there
were
some
way
to
triangulate
its
height
and
so
on
but
he
had
no
need
for
that
kind
of
thing
so
he
had
the
equipment
yes
yes
came
a
testy
dry
voice
through
the
earphone
quickly
wang
gave
his
grandfather
all
the
information
he
had
on
the
flying
thing
by
now
the
whine
had
become
a
shrill
roar
and
the
thing
in
the
air
had
become
a
fish
shape
i
think
it
coming
down
very
close
to
here
wang
concluded
you
call
the
authorities
and
let
them
know
that
one
of
the
aircraft
is
in
trouble
i
see
if
i
can
be
of
any
help
here
i
call
you
back
later
as
you
say
the
old
man
said
hurriedly
he
cut
off
wang
was
beginning
to
realize
that
the
thing
was
a
spaceship
not
an
airship
by
this
time
he
could
see
the
thing
more
clearly
he
had
never
actually
seen
a
spacecraft
but
he
seen
enough
of
them
on
television
to
know
what
they
looked
like
this
one
did
look
like
a
standard
type
at
all
and
it
did
behave
like
one
but
it
looked
even
less
like
an
airship
and
he
knew
enough
to
know
that
he
did
necessarily
know
every
type
of
spaceship
ever
built
in
shape
it
resembled
the
old
jobs
that
had
been
first
used
for
space
exploration
a
century
before
rather
than
looking
like
the
fat
ovoids
that
he
was
used
to
but
there
were
no
signs
of
rocket
exhausts
and
yet
the
ship
was
very
obviously
slowing
so
it
must
have
an
inertia
drive
it
was
coming
in
much
lower
now
on
a
line
north
of
him
headed
almost
due
east
he
urged
the
mare
forward
in
order
to
try
to
keep
up
with
the
craft
although
it
was
obviously
going
several
hundred
miles
per
hour
hardly
a
horse
pace
still
it
was
slowing
rapidly
very
rapidly
maybe
he
kept
the
mare
moving
the
strange
ship
skimmed
along
the
treetops
in
the
distance
and
disappeared
from
sight
then
there
was
a
thunderous
crash
a
tearing
of
wood
and
foliage
and
a
grinding
plowing
sound
for
a
few
seconds
afterward
there
was
silence
then
there
came
a
soft
rumble
as
of
water
beginning
to
boil
in
some
huge
but
distant
samovar
it
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
and
on
and
there
was
a
bluish
fluctuating
glow
on
the
horizon
wang
wondered
surely
not
an
ship
without
safety
cutoffs
in
this
day
and
age
he
pulled
out
his
radiophone
and
thumbed
the
call
button
again
this
time
there
was
no
delay
yes
how
are
the
radiation
detectors
behaving
there
grandfather
one
moment
i
shall
see
there
was
a
silence
then
no
unusual
activity
young
wang
why
wang
told
him
then
asked
did
you
get
hold
of
the
air
authorities
yes
they
have
no
missing
aircraft
but
they
checking
with
the
space
fields
the
way
you
describe
it
the
thing
must
be
a
spaceship
of
some
kind
i
think
so
too
i
wish
i
had
a
radiation
detector
here
though
like
to
know
whether
that
thing
is
hot
or
not
it
only
a
couple
of
miles
or
so
away
i
think
i
better
stay
away
meanwhile
you
better
put
in
a
call
to
central
headquarters
fire
control
there
going
to
be
a
holocaust
if
i
any
judge
unless
they
get
here
fast
with
plenty
of
equipment
i
see
to
it
said
his
grandfather
cutting
off
the
bluish
glow
in
the
sky
had
quite
died
away
by
now
and
the
distant
rumbling
was
gone
too
and
oddly
enough
there
was
not
much
smoke
in
the
distance
there
was
a
small
cloud
of
gray
that
rose
streamerlike
from
where
the
glow
had
been
but
even
that
faded
away
fairly
rapidly
in
the
chill
breeze
quite
obviously
there
would
be
no
fire
after
several
more
minutes
of
watching
he
was
sure
of
it
there
could
have
been
much
heat
produced
in
that
explosion
if
it
could
really
be
called
an
explosion
then
he
saw
something
moving
in
the
trees
between
himself
and
the
spot
where
the
ship
had
come
down
he
could
quite
see
what
it
was
but
it
looked
like
someone
crawling
halloo
there
he
called
out
are
you
hurt
there
was
no
answer
perhaps
whoever
it
was
did
understand
russian
wang
command
of
english
was
too
good
but
he
called
out
in
that
language
still
there
was
no
answer
whoever
it
was
had
crawled
out
of
sight
then
he
realized
that
it
could
be
anyone
crawling
no
one
could
even
have
run
the
distance
between
here
and
the
ship
in
the
time
since
it
had
hit
much
less
crawled
he
frowned
a
wolf
then
possibly
they
were
too
common
but
there
were
still
plenty
of
them
around
he
unholstered
the
heavy
pistol
at
his
side
and
as
he
slid
the
barrel
free
he
became
the
first
human
being
ever
to
see
the
nipe
for
an
instant
as
the
nipe
came
out
from
behind
a
tree
fifteen
feet
away
wang
kulichenko
froze
as
he
saw
those
four
baleful
violet
eyes
glaring
at
him
from
the
snouted
head
he
jerked
up
the
pistol
to
fire
he
was
much
too
late
his
reflexes
were
too
slow
by
far
the
nipe
launched
itself
across
the
intervening
space
in
a
blur
of
speed
that
would
have
made
a
leopard
seem
slow
the
alien
hands
slapped
aside
the
gun
with
a
violence
that
broke
the
man
wrist
while
other
hands
slammed
at
his
skull
wang
kulichenko
hardly
had
time
to
be
surprised
before
he
died
the
nipe
stood
quietly
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
thing
he
had
killed
his
stomach
churned
with
disgust
he
ignored
the
fading
hoofbeats
of
the
from
which
he
had
knocked
the
thing
that
lay
on
the
ground
with
a
crushed
skull
the
was
unintelligent
and
unimportant
this
was
the
intelligent
one
but
so
slow
so
incredibly
slow
and
so
weak
and
soft
it
seemed
impossible
that
such
beasts
could
have
survived
long
enough
on
any
world
to
evolve
to
become
the
dominant
life
form
perhaps
it
was
not
the
dominant
form
perhaps
it
was
merely
a
higher
he
would
have
to
do
more
investigating
he
picked
up
the
weapon
the
thing
had
drawn
and
examined
it
carefully
the
mechanism
was
unfamiliar
but
a
glance
at
the
muzzle
told
him
that
it
was
a
projectile
weapon
of
some
sort
the
twisted
grooves
in
the
barrel
were
obviously
designed
to
impart
a
spin
to
the
projectile
to
give
it
gyroscopic
stability
while
in
flight
the
dead
thing
must
have
thought
he
was
a
wild
animal
the
nipe
decided
surely
no
being
would
carry
a
weapon
for
use
against
members
of
its
own
or
another
intelligent
species
he
examined
the
rest
of
the
equipment
on
the
thing
not
much
information
there
too
bad
the
was
gone
there
had
apparently
been
more
equipment
strapped
to
it
the
next
question
was
what
should
he
do
with
the
body
devour
it
properly
as
one
should
with
a
validly
slain
foe
it
did
seem
that
he
could
do
anything
else
and
yet
his
stomachs
wanted
to
rebel
at
the
thought
after
all
it
was
as
if
the
thing
were
really
a
proper
being
it
was
astonishing
to
find
another
intelligent
race
none
had
ever
been
found
before
but
he
was
determined
to
show
them
that
he
was
civilized
and
intelligent
too
on
the
other
hand
they
were
obviously
of
a
lower
order
than
the
nipe
and
that
made
the
question
even
more
puzzling
in
the
end
he
decided
to
leave
the
thing
here
for
others
of
its
kind
to
find
they
would
doubtless
consume
it
properly
and
he
glanced
at
the
sky
and
listened
they
would
be
here
in
time
there
were
aircraft
coming
he
would
have
to
leave
quickly
he
had
to
find
one
of
their
production
or
supply
centers
and
he
would
have
to
do
it
alone
with
only
the
equipment
he
had
on
him
the
utter
destruction
of
his
ship
had
left
him
seriously
hampered
he
began
moving
staying
in
the
protection
of
the
trees
his
ethical
sense
still
bothered
him
it
was
not
at
all
civilized
to
leave
a
body
to
the
mercy
of
lesser
animals
or
monocells
like
that
what
kind
of
monster
would
they
think
he
was
still
there
was
no
help
for
it
if
they
caught
him
while
feeding
they
might
have
thought
him
a
lower
animal
and
shot
him
he
could
put
an
onus
like
that
upon
them
he
moved
on
iii
of
a
second
that
was
all
the
time
bart
stanton
had
from
the
first
moment
his
supersensitive
ears
heard
the
faint
whisper
of
metal
against
leather
he
made
good
use
of
it
the
noise
had
come
from
behind
and
slightly
to
the
left
of
him
so
he
drew
his
own
gun
with
his
left
hand
and
spun
to
his
left
as
he
dropped
to
a
crouch
he
had
turned
almost
completely
around
drawn
his
gun
and
fired
three
shots
before
the
other
man
had
even
leveled
his
own
weapon
the
bullets
from
stanton
gun
made
three
round
spots
on
the
man
jacket
almost
touching
each
other
and
directly
over
the
heart
the
man
blinked
stupidly
for
a
moment
looking
down
at
the
round
spots
my
god
he
said
softly
then
the
man
returned
his
weapon
slowly
to
his
holster
illustration
the
big
room
was
noisy
the
three
shots
had
merely
added
to
the
noise
of
the
gunfire
that
rattled
intermittently
around
the
two
men
and
even
that
gunfire
was
only
a
part
of
the
cacophony
the
tortured
molecules
of
the
air
in
the
room
were
so
besieged
by
the
beat
of
drums
the
blare
of
trumpets
the
crackle
of
lightning
the
rumble
of
heavy
machinery
the
squawks
and
shrieks
of
horns
and
whistles
the
rustle
of
autumn
leaves
the
snap
of
popping
popcorn
the
clink
and
jingle
of
falling
coins
and
the
yelps
bellows
howls
roars
snarls
grunts
bleats
moos
purrs
cackles
quacks
chirps
buzzes
and
hisses
of
a
myriad
of
animals
that
each
molecule
would
have
thought
that
it
was
being
shoved
in
a
hundred
thousand
different
directions
at
once
if
it
had
had
a
mind
to
think
with
the
noise
was
deafening
but
it
was
certainly
bart
stanton
had
reholstered
his
own
weapon
and
half
opened
his
lips
to
speak
when
he
heard
another
sound
behind
him
again
he
whirled
his
guns
in
hand
both
of
them
this
time
and
his
forefingers
only
fractions
of
a
millimeter
from
the
point
that
would
fire
the
hair
triggers
but
he
did
not
fire
the
second
man
had
merely
shifted
the
weapons
in
his
holsters
and
then
dropped
his
hands
away
the
noise
which
had
been
flooding
into
the
room
over
the
speaker
system
died
instantly
stanton
shoved
his
guns
back
into
place
and
rose
from
his
crouch
real
cute
he
said
grinning
i
was
expecting
that
one
the
man
he
was
facing
smiled
back
well
bart
maybe
we
proved
our
point
what
do
you
think
colonel
the
last
was
addressed
to
the
third
man
who
was
still
standing
quietly
looking
worried
and
surprised
about
the
three
spots
on
his
jacket
that
had
come
from
the
special
harmless
projectiles
in
stanton
gun
colonel
mannheim
was
four
inches
shorter
than
stanton
and
was
fifteen
years
older
but
in
spite
of
the
differences
he
would
have
laughed
at
anyone
who
had
told
him
five
minutes
before
that
he
outdraw
a
man
who
was
standing
with
his
back
turned
his
bright
blue
eyes
set
deep
beneath
craggy
brows
in
a
tanned
face
looked
speculatively
at
the
younger
man
incredible
he
said
gently
absolutely
incredible
then
he
looked
at
the
other
man
a
lean
civilian
with
mild
blue
eyes
a
shade
lighter
than
his
own
all
right
farnsworth
i
convinced
you
and
your
staff
have
quite
literally
created
a
superman
anyone
who
can
stand
in
a
room
and
hear
a
man
draw
a
gun
twenty
feet
behind
him
is
incredible
enough
the
fact
that
he
could
and
did
outdraw
and
outshoot
me
after
i
had
started
well
almost
beyond
comprehension
he
looked
back
at
bart
stanton
what
your
opinion
stanton
think
you
can
handle
the
nipe
stanton
paused
imperceptibly
before
answering
while
his
ultrafast
mind
considered
the
problem
and
arrived
at
a
decision
just
how
much
confidence
should
he
show
the
colonel
mannheim
was
a
man
with
tremendous
confidence
in
himself
but
who
was
capable
of
recognizing
that
there
were
men
who
were
his
superiors
in
one
field
or
another
if
i
ca
dispose
of
the
nipe
stanton
said
no
one
can
colonel
mannheim
nodded
slowly
i
believe
you
right
he
said
at
last
his
voice
was
firm
with
inner
conviction
he
shot
a
glance
at
farnsworth
how
about
the
second
man
farnsworth
shook
his
head
he
never
make
it
in
another
two
years
we
can
put
him
into
reasonable
shape
again
but
his
nervous
system
just
could
stand
the
gaff
can
we
get
another
man
ready
in
time
hardly
we
ca
just
pick
a
man
up
off
the
street
and
turn
him
into
a
superman
even
if
we
could
find
another
subject
with
bart
genetic
possibilities
it
would
take
more
time
than
we
have
to
spare
this
is
magic
colonel
you
do
change
a
nobody
into
a
physical
and
mental
giant
by
saying
or
by
teaching
him
how
to
pronounce
properly
i
aware
of
that
said
colonel
mannheim
without
rancor
five
years
of
work
on
stanton
must
have
taught
you
something
though
i
should
think
you
could
repeat
the
process
in
less
time
farnsworth
repeated
the
headshaking
human
beings
are
machines
colonel
they
require
time
to
heal
time
to
learn
time
to
integrate
themselves
remember
that
in
spite
of
all
our
increased
knowledge
of
anesthesia
antibiotics
viricides
and
obstetrics
it
still
takes
nine
months
to
produce
a
baby
we
in
the
same
position
only
more
so
i
see
said
mannheim
besides
farnsworth
continued
stanton
body
and
nervous
system
are
now
close
to
the
theoretical
limit
for
human
tissue
i
afraid
you
do
realize
what
kind
of
mental
stability
and
organization
are
required
to
handle
the
equipment
he
now
has
i
sure
i
do
the
colonel
agreed
i
doubt
if
anyone
besides
stanton
himself
knows
farnsworth
manner
softened
a
little
you
probably
quite
right
suffice
it
to
say
that
bartholomew
stanton
is
the
only
answer
we
found
so
far
and
the
only
answer
visible
in
the
foreseeable
future
to
the
problem
posed
by
the
nipe
the
colonel
face
darkened
i
keep
hoping
that
our
policy
of
handling
the
nipe
has
been
a
mistake
if
it
has
it
going
to
prove
a
fatal
one
for
the
whole
race
let
go
into
the
lounge
farnsworth
said
standing
around
in
an
empty
chamber
like
this
is
the
most
comfortable
way
to
discuss
the
fate
of
mankind
his
voice
brought
hollow
echoes
from
the
walls
colonel
mannheim
grinned
at
the
touch
of
lightness
the
biophysicist
had
injected
into
the
conversation
very
well
i
could
do
with
some
coffee
if
you
have
some
all
you
want
said
farnsworth
leading
the
way
toward
the
door
of
the
chamber
and
opening
it
or
if
you
prefer
something
with
a
little
more
power
to
it
thanks
no
coffee
will
do
fine
said
mannheim
how
about
you
mr
stanton
bart
stanton
shook
his
head
i
love
to
have
some
coffee
but
i
leave
the
alcohol
alone
i
just
have
the
luck
to
be
finishing
a
drink
when
our
friend
the
nipe
popped
in
on
us
and
when
i
do
meet
him
i
going
to
need
every
microsecond
of
reflex
speed
i
can
scrape
up
they
walked
down
a
corridor
to
an
elevator
which
whisked
them
up
to
the
main
level
of
the
neurophysical
institute
building
another
corridor
led
them
to
a
room
that
might
have
been
the
common
room
of
one
of
the
more
exclusive
men
clubs
there
were
soft
chairs
and
shelves
of
books
and
reading
tables
and
smoking
stands
all
quietly
luxurious
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
when
the
three
men
entered
we
can
have
some
privacy
here
farnsworth
said
none
of
the
rest
of
the
staff
will
come
in
until
we
through
colonel
mannheim
looked
at
the
biophysicist
speculatively
you
seem
to
think
secrecy
important
all
of
a
sudden
bart
stanton
grinned
and
kept
silent
farnsworth
went
over
to
a
table
where
an
urn
of
coffee
radiated
soft
warmth
cream
and
sugar
over
there
on
the
tray
he
said
as
he
began
to
fill
cups
frankly
colonel
mannheim
said
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
find
us
a
place
where
we
could
talk
privately
you
seem
to
have
anticipated
me
i
thought
you
might
have
something
like
that
in
mind
said
farnsworth
without
looking
up
the
cups
were
filled
and
the
three
men
sat
down
in
a
triangle
of
chairs
before
any
of
them
spoke
again
colonel
mannheim
took
a
sip
from
his
cup
and
then
looked
up
all
right
we
begin
this
way
stanton
granted
that
you
been
through
five
years
of
hell
but
how
closely
have
you
stayed
in
touch
with
the
nipe
situation
as
best
i
could
through
news
bulletins
and
information
that
your
office
has
sent
here
could
you
give
me
an
oral
summary
bart
stanton
thought
for
a
moment
it
was
true
that
he
been
out
of
touch
with
what
had
been
going
on
outside
the
walls
of
the
neurophysical
institute
for
the
past
five
years
in
spite
of
the
reading
he
done
and
the
newscasts
he
watched
and
the
tv
tapes
he
seen
he
still
had
no
real
feeling
for
the
situation
there
were
hazy
periods
during
that
five
years
he
had
undergone
extensive
glandular
and
neural
operations
of
great
delicacy
many
of
which
had
resulted
in
what
could
have
been
agonizing
pain
without
the
use
of
suppressors
as
a
result
he
possessed
a
biological
engine
that
for
sheer
driving
power
and
nicety
of
control
surpassed
any
other
known
to
exist
or
to
have
ever
existed
on
earth
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
nipe
but
those
five
years
of
rebuilding
and
retraining
had
left
a
gap
in
his
life
several
of
the
steps
required
to
make
the
conversion
from
man
to
superman
had
resulted
in
temporary
insanity
the
wild
swinging
imbalances
of
glandular
secretions
seeking
a
new
balance
the
erratic
misfirings
of
neurons
as
they
attempted
to
adjust
to
higher
velocities
and
the
sheer
fatigue
engendered
by
cells
which
were
acting
too
rapidly
for
a
lagging
excretory
system
all
had
contributed
to
periods
of
greater
or
lesser
mental
abnormality
that
he
was
sane
now
there
was
no
question
but
there
were
holes
in
his
memory
that
still
had
to
be
filled
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
but
carefully
telling
the
colonel
all
he
knew
about
the
situation
up
to
the
present
it
was
much
it
was
late
october
and
the
nipe
blithely
evading
capture
for
ten
long
years
was
still
going
about
his
unknown
and
possibly
incomprehensible
business
the
nipe
had
become
a
legend
he
had
replaced
satan
the
bogeyman
frankenstein
monster
and
mumbo
jumbo
lord
of
the
congo
in
the
public
mind
he
had
taken
on
in
popular
thought
the
attributes
of
the
djinn
the
vampire
the
ghoul
the
werewolf
and
every
other
horror
and
hobgoblin
that
the
mind
of
man
had
conjured
up
in
the
previous
years
that
he
had
been
connected
with
the
mysterious
crash
in
siberia
ten
years
before
was
almost
a
certainty
how
he
had
managed
to
get
from
there
to
leningrad
without
being
seen
once
was
more
of
a
mystery
but
certainly
not
impossible
in
the
light
of
what
had
been
done
since
eight
months
later
a
phone
call
had
been
received
by
the
regent
board
of
the
khrushchev
memorial
psychiatric
hospital
in
leningrad
an
odd
breathy
voice
offered
in
very
bad
russian
a
meeting
the
nipe
had
managed
to
explain
in
spite
of
the
language
handicap
that
he
did
not
want
to
be
mistaken
for
a
wild
animal
as
had
happened
with
the
forest
ranger
the
psychiatrists
were
divided
in
their
opinions
some
thought
that
the
call
had
been
from
a
deranged
person
when
the
nipe
actually
showed
up
at
the
appointed
place
those
minds
changed
rapidly
the
nipe
ability
to
use
any
human
language
was
limited
he
picked
up
vocabulary
and
grammatical
rules
very
rapidly
but
he
seemed
completely
unable
to
use
a
language
beyond
discussion
of
concrete
actions
and
objects
his
mind
was
simply
too
alien
to
enable
him
to
do
more
than
touch
the
edges
of
human
communication
in
the
discussion
of
mathematics
in
particular
the
nipe
seemed
to
be
completely
at
a
loss
he
apparently
thought
of
mathematics
as
a
language
instead
of
a
one
and
could
not
progress
beyond
simple
diagrams
he
was
captured
in
any
real
sense
of
the
word
he
refused
to
allow
any
physical
tests
on
his
body
and
short
of
threatening
him
at
there
did
seem
to
be
any
practicable
way
to
force
him
to
accede
to
the
human
wishes
and
they
could
do
that
the
nipe
had
to
be
treated
as
an
emissary
from
his
home
world
wherever
that
was
he
killed
a
man
yes
but
that
had
to
be
allowed
as
justifiable
homicide
in
since
the
forester
had
drawn
a
gun
and
was
ready
to
fire
nobody
could
blame
the
late
wang
kulichenko
for
that
but
nobody
could
blame
the
nipe
either
for
six
weeks
the
humans
and
the
nipe
had
tried
to
arrive
at
a
meeting
of
minds
and
just
when
it
would
seem
within
grasp
it
would
fade
away
into
mist
it
was
nearly
a
month
before
the
russian
psychologists
and
psychiatrists
realized
that
the
reason
the
nipe
had
come
to
them
was
because
he
had
thought
that
they
were
the
ruling
body
of
that
territory
the
un
observers
stayed
out
of
it
at
first
before
there
was
any
kind
of
talk
on
a
government
level
there
must
be
some
kind
of
understanding
on
a
personal
level
and
that
of
course
was
never
achieved
just
what
had
set
off
the
nipe
anger
has
been
established
yet
as
far
as
stanton
knew
at
a
meeting
one
day
he
had
simply
become
more
and
more
incomprehensible
and
then
without
any
warning
he
had
leaped
out
killed
three
of
the
men
with
his
bare
hands
and
gone
out
the
window
and
that
had
been
the
end
of
any
diplomatic
relations
between
humanity
and
the
nipe
since
that
time
he
been
on
a
rampage
of
robbery
and
murder
he
was
as
callously
indifferent
to
human
life
and
property
as
a
human
being
might
be
with
the
life
and
property
of
a
cockroach
there
have
been
human
criminals
whose
actions
could
be
described
in
the
same
way
but
the
nipe
had
a
few
touches
that
few
human
criminals
would
have
thought
of
and
almost
none
would
have
had
the
capacity
to
execute
if
for
instance
the
nipe
had
time
to
spare
his
victims
would
be
an
annoying
problem
in
identification
when
found
for
there
would
be
nothing
left
but
bones
and
time
to
spare
in
this
case
meant
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
the
nipe
had
if
nothing
else
a
very
efficient
digestive
tract
he
ate
like
a
shrew
and
the
nipe
never
under
any
circumstances
used
any
weapon
but
the
weapons
nature
had
given
him
or
claws
or
teeth
never
did
he
use
a
knife
or
gun
or
even
a
club
almost
as
an
afterthought
one
realized
that
the
loot
which
the
nipe
stole
was
seemingly
unpredictable
money
as
such
he
apparently
had
no
use
for
he
had
taken
gold
silver
and
platinum
but
one
raid
for
each
of
these
elements
had
evidently
been
enough
except
for
silver
which
had
required
three
raids
over
a
period
of
four
years
since
then
he
had
touched
silver
again
he
had
tried
yet
for
any
of
the
radioactives
except
radium
he
taken
a
full
ounce
of
that
in
five
raids
but
had
attempted
to
get
his
hands
on
uranium
thorium
plutonium
or
any
of
the
other
elements
normally
associated
with
atomic
energy
nor
had
he
tried
to
steal
any
of
the
fusion
materials
the
heavy
isotopes
of
hydrogen
or
any
of
the
lithium
isotopes
beryllium
had
been
taken
but
whether
there
was
any
significance
in
the
thefts
or
not
no
one
knew
illustration
there
was
a
pattern
in
the
thefts
nonetheless
they
had
begun
small
and
increased
scientific
and
technical
instruments
oscilloscopes
generators
radar
equipment
maser
sets
dynostatic
crystals
thermolight
resonators
and
so
on
were
stolen
complete
or
gutted
for
various
parts
after
awhile
he
went
on
to
bigger
things
whole
aircraft
with
their
crews
had
vanished
that
he
had
not
committed
anywhere
near
all
the
crimes
that
had
been
attributed
to
him
was
certain
that
he
committed
a
great
many
of
them
was
equally
certain
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
his
loot
was
being
used
to
make
instruments
and
devices
of
unknown
kinds
he
had
used
several
of
them
on
his
raids
the
one
that
could
apparently
phase
out
almost
any
electromagnetic
frequency
up
to
about
a
hundred
thousand
megacycles
including
power
frequencies
was
considered
to
be
a
particularly
cute
item
so
was
the
gadget
that
reduced
the
tensile
strength
of
concrete
to
about
that
of
a
good
grade
of
marshmallow
after
he
had
been
operating
for
a
few
years
there
was
no
installation
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
could
be
considered
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
he
struck
when
and
where
he
wanted
and
took
whatever
he
needed
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
guard
against
the
nipe
since
no
one
knew
what
sort
of
loot
might
strike
his
fancy
next
and
there
was
therefore
no
way
of
knowing
where
or
how
he
would
hit
next
nor
could
he
ever
be
found
after
one
of
his
raids
they
were
plotted
and
followed
out
with
diabolical
accuracy
and
thoroughness
he
struck
looted
and
vanished
and
was
seen
again
until
his
next
strike
colonel
mannheim
who
had
carefully
puffed
a
cigar
alight
and
smoked
it
thoughtfully
during
stanton
recitation
dropped
the
remains
of
the
cigar
into
an
ash
receptacle
accurate
but
incomplete
he
said
quietly
you
must
have
made
some
guesses
he
looked
from
bart
stanton
to
farnsworth
i
like
to
hear
them
farnsworth
finished
off
the
last
of
his
coffee
we
talked
about
it
he
admitted
although
i
must
say
the
hypothesis
bart
has
come
up
with
would
never
have
occurred
to
me
i
still
not
sure
i
credit
it
but
he
shrugged
i
ca
say
that
i
disbelieve
it
either
mannheim
turned
his
eyes
back
to
stanton
his
silence
was
a
question
logically
my
theory
might
hold
much
water
stanton
admitted
but
the
evidence
seems
to
be
conclusive
enough
to
me
he
got
up
went
over
to
the
coffee
urn
and
refilled
his
cup
it
seems
incredible
to
me
that
the
combined
intelligence
and
organizational
ability
of
the
un
government
is
incapable
of
finding
anything
out
about
one
single
alien
no
matter
how
competent
he
may
be
he
said
as
he
returned
to
his
seat
somehow
somewhere
someone
must
have
gotten
a
line
on
the
nipe
he
must
have
a
base
for
his
operations
and
someone
should
have
found
it
by
this
time
if
there
is
such
a
base
then
it
must
be
possible
to
blast
him
out
of
it
without
resorting
to
the
kind
of
work
it
took
to
produce
me
i
may
be
faster
and
more
sensitive
and
stronger
than
the
average
man
but
that
does
mean
that
i
have
superhuman
abilities
to
the
extent
that
i
can
do
in
two
or
three
years
what
the
combined
forces
of
the
government
could
do
in
ten
certainly
you
would
rely
too
heavily
on
it
and
yet
apparently
you
are
to
me
that
can
only
mean
that
you
got
another
ace
up
your
sleeve
you
we
going
to
get
the
nipe
before
i
die
you
either
have
a
sure
way
of
tracing
him
or
else
you
already
know
where
he
is
which
is
it
colonel
mannheim
sighed
we
know
where
he
is
we
known
for
six
years
iv
interlude
the
woman
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
for
which
the
doctor
was
privately
thankful
at
least
the
original
shock
had
worn
off
and
there
nothing
we
can
do
nothing
there
was
a
slight
catch
in
her
voice
i
afraid
not
not
yet
there
are
research
teams
working
on
the
problem
and
one
day
perhaps
then
he
shook
his
head
but
not
yet
he
paused
i
sorry
mrs
stanton
the
woman
sat
there
on
the
comfortable
chair
and
looked
at
the
specialist
diploma
that
hung
on
the
doctor
wall
and
yet
she
really
see
the
diploma
at
all
she
was
seeing
something
else
a
kind
of
dream
that
had
been
shattered
after
a
moment
she
began
to
speak
her
voice
low
and
gentle
as
though
the
dream
were
still
going
on
and
she
were
half
afraid
she
might
waken
herself
if
she
spoke
too
loudly
jim
and
i
were
so
glad
they
were
twins
identical
twin
boys
he
said
i
remember
he
said
ought
to
call
ike
and
mike
and
he
laughed
a
little
when
he
said
it
to
show
he
did
mean
it
i
remember
i
was
propped
up
in
the
bed
the
afternoon
they
were
born
and
jim
had
brought
me
a
new
bed
jacket
and
i
said
i
did
need
a
new
one
because
i
would
be
going
home
the
next
day
and
he
said
kid
you
do
think
i
just
buy
a
bed
jacket
just
for
hospital
use
do
you
this
is
for
breakfasts
in
bed
too
and
that
when
he
said
he
seen
the
boys
and
said
we
ought
to
name
them
ike
and
mike
the
tears
were
coming
down
stanton
cheeks
heavily
now
and
grief
made
her
look
older
than
her
years
but
the
doctor
said
nothing
letting
her
spill
out
her
emotions
in
words
we
talked
about
it
before
you
know
as
soon
as
the
obstetrician
found
out
that
i
was
going
to
have
twins
and
jim
jim
said
that
we
name
them
alike
unless
they
were
identical
twins
or
mirror
twins
if
they
were
fraternal
twins
we
just
name
them
as
if
they
been
ordinary
brothers
or
sisters
or
whatever
you
know
she
looked
at
the
doctor
pleading
for
understanding
i
know
he
said
and
jim
was
always
kidding
if
they
were
girls
he
said
we
ought
to
call
them
flora
and
dora
or
annie
and
fanny
or
maybe
susie
and
floozie
he
was
always
kidding
about
it
you
know
i
know
said
the
doctor
and
then
when
they
identical
boys
he
was
very
sensible
about
it
call
them
martin
and
bartholomew
he
said
if
they
want
to
call
themselves
mart
and
bart
they
can
but
they
wo
be
stuck
with
rhyming
names
if
they
do
want
them
jim
was
very
thoughtful
that
way
doctor
very
thoughtful
she
suddenly
seemed
to
realize
that
she
was
crying
and
took
a
handkerchief
out
of
her
sleeve
to
dab
at
her
eyes
and
face
i
have
to
quit
crying
she
said
trying
to
sound
brave
and
strong
after
all
it
could
have
been
worse
could
it
i
mean
the
radiation
could
have
killed
my
boys
too
jim
dead
yes
and
i
got
to
get
used
to
that
but
i
still
have
two
boys
to
take
care
of
and
they
need
me
yes
stanton
they
will
said
the
doctor
they
both
need
you
and
you
have
to
be
very
gentle
and
very
careful
with
both
of
them
how
how
do
you
mean
that
she
asked
the
doctor
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
chose
his
words
carefully
identical
twins
tend
to
identify
with
each
other
stanton
there
is
a
great
deal
of
empathy
between
people
who
are
not
only
of
the
same
age
but
genetically
identical
if
they
were
both
healthy
there
would
be
very
little
trouble
in
their
education
at
home
or
at
school
any
of
the
standard
texts
on
psychodynamics
in
education
will
show
you
the
pitfalls
to
avoid
when
dealing
with
identical
siblings
but
these
boys
are
no
longer
identical
one
is
normal
healthy
and
lively
the
other
is
well
as
you
have
seen
he
is
slow
sluggish
and
badly
that
condition
may
improve
with
time
but
until
we
know
more
about
such
damage
than
we
do
now
he
will
be
an
invalid
that
the
trouble
with
radiation
damage
stanton
even
when
we
can
save
the
victim
life
we
can
not
always
save
his
health
you
can
see
i
think
what
sort
of
psychic
disturbances
this
can
bring
about
in
such
a
pair
the
ill
boy
tends
to
identify
with
the
well
one
and
unfortunately
the
reverse
is
true
if
they
are
not
properly
handled
during
their
formative
years
stanton
both
can
be
badly
damaged
emotionally
i
i
think
i
understand
the
woman
said
but
what
sort
of
thing
should
i
look
out
for
i
suggest
that
you
get
a
good
man
in
psychic
development
the
doctor
said
i
hesitate
to
prescribe
it
out
of
my
field
but
in
general
most
of
your
trouble
will
be
caused
by
a
tendency
for
the
pair
to
swing
into
one
of
two
extremes
mutual
antagonism
can
arise
if
one
becomes
jealous
of
the
other
health
while
the
healthy
one
becomes
jealous
of
the
extra
consideration
shown
his
crippled
brother
or
on
the
other
hand
the
healthy
boy
may
identify
so
closely
with
his
brother
that
he
feels
every
hurt
or
slight
real
or
imagined
he
becomes
at
the
same
time
the
other
brother
may
come
to
depend
completely
on
the
healthy
twin
in
both
these
situations
there
is
a
positive
feedback
which
constantly
worsens
the
situation
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
careful
observation
and
careful
application
of
the
proper
educational
stimuli
to
keep
the
situation
from
developing
toward
either
extreme
you
need
expert
help
if
you
want
both
boys
to
display
the
full
abilities
of
which
they
are
potentially
capable
i
see
could
you
give
me
the
name
of
a
good
man
doctor
the
doctor
nodded
and
picked
up
a
book
on
his
desk
i
give
you
several
names
you
can
pick
the
one
you
like
they
all
good
men
there
are
many
good
women
in
the
field
too
but
in
this
case
i
think
a
man
would
be
best
of
course
if
one
of
them
thinks
a
woman
is
indicated
that
up
to
him
as
i
said
that
is
my
field
he
opened
the
small
book
and
riffled
through
it
to
find
the
names
he
wanted
v
the
image
of
the
nipe
on
the
glowing
screen
was
clear
and
finely
detailed
it
was
bart
thought
as
though
one
were
looking
through
a
window
into
the
nipe
nest
itself
only
the
tremendous
depth
of
focus
of
the
lens
which
caught
the
picture
gave
the
illusion
a
sense
of
unreality
everything
background
and
foreground
alike
was
sharply
in
focus
the
nipe
moved
in
slow
motion
giving
the
watchers
the
eerie
feeling
that
he
was
moving
through
a
thicker
heavier
medium
than
air
in
a
place
where
the
gravity
was
much
less
than
that
of
earth
speed
the
tape
up
to
normal
said
colonel
mannheim
to
the
man
who
was
operating
the
machine
if
there
anything
stanton
wants
to
look
at
more
closely
we
can
run
it
through
again
as
if
in
obedience
to
the
colonel
command
the
nipe
seemed
to
shake
himself
a
little
and
go
about
his
business
more
briskly
and
the
air
and
gravity
seemed
to
revert
to
those
of
earth
what
he
doing
stanton
asked
the
nipe
was
doing
something
with
an
box
that
sat
on
the
floor
in
front
of
him
he
got
a
screwdriver
that
he
modified
to
give
it
a
head
with
an
and
he
wiggling
it
around
inside
that
hole
in
the
box
but
what
he
doing
is
a
secret
between
god
and
the
nipe
at
this
point
the
colonel
said
glumly
stanton
glanced
away
from
the
screen
for
a
moment
to
look
at
the
other
men
who
were
there
some
of
them
were
watching
the
screen
but
most
of
them
seemed
to
be
watching
stanton
although
they
looked
away
as
soon
as
they
saw
his
eyes
on
them
to
see
what
kind
of
a
bloke
this
touted
superman
stanton
thought
i
ca
say
i
blame
he
brought
his
attention
back
to
the
screen
so
this
was
the
nipe
hideaway
he
wondered
if
it
were
furnished
in
the
fashion
that
a
nipe
living
quarters
would
be
furnished
on
whatever
planet
the
multilegged
horror
called
home
probably
it
had
the
same
similarity
as
robinson
crusoe
island
home
had
to
a
nineteenth
century
english
home
there
was
no
furniture
at
all
as
such
as
he
was
the
nipe
needed
no
tables
for
his
work
and
sleeping
was
a
form
of
metabolic
rest
that
he
evidently
found
unnecessary
although
he
would
sometimes
just
remain
quiet
for
periods
of
time
ranging
from
a
few
minutes
to
a
couple
of
hours
we
had
a
hard
time
getting
the
first
cameras
in
there
the
colonel
was
saying
that
why
we
missed
some
of
the
early
stages
of
his
work
there
look
at
that
that
attachment
he
making
that
right
now
it
looks
as
though
it
a
meter
of
some
kind
but
we
do
know
whether
it
a
test
instrument
or
an
integral
part
of
the
machine
he
making
the
whole
thing
might
be
a
test
instrument
after
all
he
had
to
start
out
from
the
very
beginning
making
the
tools
to
make
the
tools
to
make
the
tools
you
know
it
not
quite
as
bad
as
all
that
said
one
of
the
other
men
who
had
been
briefly
introduced
to
stanton
as
fred
meyer
after
all
he
had
our
technology
to
draw
upon
if
he
been
wrecked
on
earth
two
or
three
centuries
ago
he
would
have
been
able
to
do
a
thing
granted
the
colonel
said
agreeably
but
it
quite
obvious
that
there
are
parts
of
our
technology
that
are
just
as
alien
to
him
as
parts
of
his
are
to
us
remember
how
he
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
building
a
pentode
vacuum
tube
for
a
job
that
could
have
been
done
by
transistors
his
knowledge
of
physics
seems
to
be
about
a
century
and
a
half
behind
ours
not
completely
colonel
meyer
said
that
gimmick
he
built
last
year
the
one
that
blinded
those
people
in
bagdad
had
five
perfect
emeralds
in
it
connected
in
series
with
silver
wire
that
true
our
technologies
seem
to
overlap
in
some
areas
but
in
others
there
total
alienness
which
one
would
you
say
was
ahead
of
the
other
stanton
asked
hard
to
say
said
colonel
mannheim
but
i
put
my
money
on
his
technology
as
encompassing
more
than
ours
at
least
insofar
as
the
physical
sciences
are
concerned
i
agree
said
meyer
he
got
things
in
that
little
nest
of
his
that
he
stopped
and
shook
his
head
slowly
as
though
he
could
find
words
i
say
this
bart
stanton
said
musingly
our
friend
the
nipe
has
plenty
of
guts
and
patience
he
smiled
a
little
and
then
amended
his
statement
from
our
own
point
of
view
that
is
colonel
mannheim
face
took
on
a
quizzical
expression
how
do
you
mean
i
was
about
to
agree
with
you
until
you
tacked
that
last
phrase
on
what
does
point
of
view
have
to
do
with
it
everything
i
should
say
stanton
said
it
all
depends
on
the
equipment
an
individual
has
a
man
who
rushes
into
a
burning
building
to
save
a
life
wearing
nothing
but
street
clothes
has
courage
a
man
who
does
the
same
thing
when
he
wearing
a
nullotherm
suit
is
an
unknown
quantity
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
from
that
action
alone
whether
he
has
courage
or
not
meyer
looked
a
little
dazed
pardon
me
if
i
seem
thick
stanton
but
are
you
saying
that
the
nipe
technological
equipment
is
better
than
ours
not
at
all
i
talking
about
his
personal
equipment
he
turned
again
to
the
colonel
colonel
mannheim
do
you
think
it
would
require
any
personal
courage
on
my
part
to
stand
up
against
you
in
a
gunfight
the
colonel
grinned
tightly
i
see
what
you
mean
no
it
would
on
the
other
hand
if
were
to
challenge
bart
stanton
continued
would
show
courage
not
really
foolhardiness
stupidity
or
insanity
not
courage
then
neither
of
us
can
prove
we
have
guts
enough
to
fight
the
other
can
we
colonel
mannheim
smiled
grimly
and
said
nothing
but
meyer
who
evidently
had
a
great
deal
of
respect
for
the
colonel
said
now
wait
a
second
that
depends
on
the
circumstances
if
colonel
mannheim
say
knew
that
forcing
you
to
shoot
him
would
save
someone
else
life
someone
more
important
say
or
maybe
a
of
people
then
colonel
mannheim
laughed
meyer
you
just
proved
stanton
point
meyer
gaped
for
a
half
second
then
burst
into
laughter
himself
pardon
my
point
of
view
stanton
i
guess
i
a
little
slow
mannheim
said
precisely
whether
the
nipe
has
courage
or
patience
or
any
other
human
feeling
depends
on
his
own
abilities
and
on
how
much
information
he
has
a
man
can
perform
any
action
without
fear
if
he
knows
that
it
will
not
hurt
him
or
if
he
does
know
that
it
he
glanced
at
the
screen
the
nipe
had
settled
down
into
his
sleeping
position
unmoving
although
his
baleful
violet
eyes
were
still
open
cut
that
off
meyer
the
colonel
said
there
not
much
to
learn
from
the
rest
of
that
tape
have
you
actually
managed
to
build
any
of
the
devices
he
constructed
stanton
asked
some
said
colonel
mannheim
we
have
specialists
all
over
the
world
studying
the
tapes
we
have
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
watch
every
step
the
nipe
makes
and
we
know
the
materials
he
using
to
work
with
but
even
so
the
scientists
are
baffled
by
many
of
them
can
you
imagine
the
time
james
clerk
maxwell
would
have
had
trying
to
build
a
modern
television
set
from
tapes
like
this
illustration
i
know
exactly
how
he
feel
meyer
said
glumly
you
can
see
then
why
we
depending
on
you
mannheim
told
stanton
stanton
merely
nodded
the
knowledge
that
he
was
actually
a
focal
point
in
human
history
that
the
whole
future
of
the
human
race
depended
to
a
tremendous
extent
on
him
was
a
realization
that
weighed
heavily
and
at
the
same
time
was
immensely
bracing
and
now
the
colonel
said
i
turn
you
over
to
the
psychology
department
they
be
able
to
give
you
a
great
deal
more
information
on
the
nipe
than
i
can
vi
the
nipe
squatted
brooding
in
his
underground
nest
waiting
for
the
special
crystallization
process
to
take
place
in
the
alloy
that
was
forming
in
the
reactor
long
he
wondered
he
was
not
thinking
of
the
crystallization
reaction
he
knew
the
timing
of
that
to
the
fraction
of
a
second
his
dark
thoughts
were
focused
inwardly
upon
himself
how
long
would
it
be
before
he
would
be
able
to
construct
the
communicator
that
would
put
him
in
touch
with
his
own
race
again
how
long
before
he
could
discourse
again
with
reasonable
beings
for
how
much
longer
would
he
be
stranded
on
an
insane
planet
surrounded
by
degraded
insane
beings
the
work
was
going
incredibly
slowly
he
had
known
at
the
beginning
that
his
knowledge
of
the
basic
arts
required
to
build
a
communicator
was
incomplete
but
he
had
not
realized
just
how
painfully
inadequate
it
was
time
after
time
his
instruments
had
simply
refused
to
function
because
of
some
basic
flaw
in
their
manufacture
some
flaw
that
an
expert
in
that
field
could
have
pointed
out
at
once
time
after
time
equipment
had
had
to
be
rebuilt
almost
from
the
beginning
and
time
after
time
only
methods
were
available
for
correcting
his
errors
not
even
his
prodigious
and
accurate
memory
could
hold
all
the
information
that
was
necessary
for
the
work
and
there
were
no
reference
tapes
available
of
course
he
had
long
since
given
up
any
attempt
to
understand
the
functioning
of
the
mad
that
surrounded
him
he
was
quite
certain
that
the
beings
he
had
seen
could
not
possibly
be
the
real
rulers
of
this
society
but
he
had
as
yet
no
inkling
as
to
who
the
real
rulers
were
as
to
they
were
that
question
seemed
a
little
easier
to
answer
it
was
highly
probable
that
they
were
out
in
space
on
the
asteriods
that
his
instruments
had
detected
as
he
had
dropped
in
toward
this
planet
so
many
years
before
he
had
made
an
error
back
then
in
not
landing
in
the
belt
but
at
no
time
since
had
he
experienced
the
emotion
of
regret
or
wished
he
had
done
differently
both
thoughts
would
have
been
incomprehensible
to
the
nipe
he
had
made
an
error
the
circumstances
had
been
checked
and
noted
he
would
not
make
that
error
again
what
further
action
could
be
taken
by
a
logical
mind
none
the
past
was
unchangeable
it
existed
only
as
a
memory
in
his
own
mind
and
there
was
no
way
to
change
that
indelible
record
even
had
he
wished
to
do
such
an
insane
thing
surely
he
thought
the
real
rulers
must
know
of
his
existence
he
had
tried
by
his
every
action
to
show
that
he
was
a
reasoning
intelligent
and
civilized
being
why
had
they
taken
no
action
his
hypotheses
he
realized
were
weak
because
of
lack
of
data
he
could
only
wait
for
more
information
that
and
continue
to
work
vii
interlude
frobisher
touched
the
control
button
that
depolarized
the
window
in
the
breakfast
room
letting
the
morning
sun
stream
in
then
she
said
in
a
low
voice
larry
come
here
larry
frobisher
looked
up
from
his
morning
coffee
what
is
it
hon
the
stanton
boys
come
look
frobisher
sighed
who
are
the
stanton
boys
and
why
should
i
come
look
but
he
got
up
and
came
over
to
the
window
see
over
there
on
the
walkway
toward
the
play
area
she
said
i
see
three
girls
and
a
boy
pushing
a
wheeled
contraption
frobisher
said
or
do
you
mean
that
the
stanford
boys
are
dressed
up
as
girls
she
corrected
him
they
just
moved
into
the
apartment
on
the
first
floor
who
the
three
girls
no
silly
the
two
stanton
boys
and
their
mother
one
of
them
is
in
that
contraption
it
called
a
therapeutic
chair
oh
so
the
poor
kid
been
hurt
what
so
interesting
about
that
aside
from
morbid
curiosity
the
boy
pushing
the
chair
went
around
a
bend
in
the
walkway
out
of
sight
and
frobisher
went
back
to
his
coffee
while
his
wife
spoke
their
names
are
mart
and
bart
they
twins
i
should
think
frobisher
said
applying
himself
to
his
breakfast
that
the
mother
would
get
a
chair
for
the
boy
instead
of
making
the
other
boy
push
it
the
poor
boy
ca
control
the
chair
dear
something
wrong
with
his
nervous
system
i
understand
that
he
was
exposed
to
some
kind
of
radiation
when
he
was
only
two
years
old
that
why
the
chair
has
all
the
instruments
built
into
it
even
his
heartbeat
has
to
be
controlled
electronically
shame
frobisher
speared
a
bit
of
sausage
kind
of
rough
on
both
of
i
guess
how
do
you
mean
well
i
mean
like
well
for
instance
why
are
they
going
over
to
the
play
area
play
games
right
the
one
that
well
has
to
push
his
brother
over
there
ca
just
get
out
and
go
has
to
take
the
brother
along
kind
of
a
burden
see
and
then
the
kid
in
the
chair
has
to
sit
there
and
watch
his
brother
play
basketball
or
jai
alai
while
he
ca
do
anything
himself
like
i
say
kind
of
rough
on
both
of
them
yes
i
suppose
it
must
be
more
coffee
thanks
honey
and
another
slice
of
toast

viii
the
two
objects
floating
in
space
both
looked
like
pitted
pieces
of
rock
the
larger
one
roughly
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
its
greatest
dimension
was
actually
that
a
hunk
of
rock
the
smaller
smaller
of
the
two
was
a
camouflaged
spaceboat
the
smaller
was
on
a
course
with
reference
to
the
larger
although
their
relative
velocities
were
not
great
at
precisely
the
right
time
the
smaller
drifted
by
the
larger
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
the
weakness
of
the
gravitational
fields
generated
between
the
two
caused
only
a
slight
change
of
orbit
on
the
part
of
both
bodies
then
they
began
to
separate
but
during
the
few
seconds
of
their
closest
approach
a
third
body
had
detached
itself
from
the
camouflaged
spaceboat
and
shot
rapidly
across
the
intervening
distance
to
land
on
the
surface
of
the
floating
mountain
the
third
body
was
a
man
in
a
spacesuit
as
soon
as
he
landed
he
sat
down
and
checked
the
instrument
case
he
held
in
his
hands
no
response
thus
far
then
he
had
succeeded
he
had
had
to
pick
his
time
precisely
the
people
who
were
already
on
this
small
planetoid
could
not
use
their
detection
equipment
while
the
planetoid
itself
was
within
detection
range
of
beacon
only
two
hundred
and
eighty
miles
away
not
if
they
wanted
to
keep
from
being
found
radar
pulses
emanating
from
a
presumably
lifeless
planetoid
would
be
a
dead
giveaway
other
than
that
they
were
mathematically
safe
if
they
depended
on
the
laws
of
chance
no
ship
moving
through
the
asteroid
belt
would
dare
to
move
at
any
decent
velocity
without
using
radar
so
the
people
on
this
particular
lump
of
planetary
flotsam
would
be
able
to
spot
a
approach
easily
long
before
their
own
weak
detection
system
would
register
on
the
of
the
approaching
ship
the
power
and
range
needed
by
a
given
detector
depends
on
the
relative
velocity
the
greater
that
velocity
the
more
power
the
greater
range
needed
at
one
mile
per
second
a
ship
needs
a
range
of
only
thirty
miles
to
spot
an
obstacle
thirty
seconds
away
at
ten
miles
per
second
it
needs
a
range
of
three
hundred
miles
the
man
who
called
himself
stanley
martin
had
carefully
plotted
the
orbit
of
this
particular
planetoid
and
then
let
his
spaceboat
coast
in
without
using
any
detection
equipment
except
the
visual
it
had
been
necessary
but
very
risky
had
the
people
here
seen
his
boat
if
so
had
they
recognized
it
in
spite
of
the
heavy
camouflage
and
even
if
they
only
suspected
what
would
be
their
reaction
he
waited
it
takes
nerve
and
patience
to
wait
for
thirteen
solid
hours
without
moving
more
than
an
occasional
flexure
of
muscles
but
he
managed
that
long
before
the
instrument
case
waggled
a
meter
needle
at
him
the
one
relieving
factor
was
the
low
gravity
on
an
asteroid
the
problem
of
sleeping
on
a
bed
of
nails
is
caused
by
the
likelihood
of
accidentally
throwing
oneself
off
the
bed
the
probability
of
puncture
or
discomfort
from
the
points
is
almost
negligible
when
the
needle
on
the
instrument
panel
flickered
he
got
to
his
feet
and
began
moving
he
was
almost
certain
that
he
had
not
been
detected
walking
was
out
of
the
question
this
was
a
rock
not
a
one
the
group
that
occupied
it
had
deliberately
chosen
it
that
way
so
that
there
would
be
no
chance
of
its
being
picked
out
for
slicing
by
one
of
the
mining
teams
in
the
asteroid
belt
granted
the
chance
of
any
given
metallic
planetoid
being
selected
was
very
small
they
had
not
even
wanted
to
take
that
chance
therefore
without
any
magnetic
field
to
hold
him
down
and
only
a
very
tiny
gravitic
field
the
man
had
to
use
different
tactics
it
was
more
like
mountain
climbing
than
anything
else
except
that
there
was
no
danger
of
falling
he
crawled
over
the
surface
in
the
same
way
that
an
alpine
climber
might
crawl
up
the
side
of
a
steep
slope
seeking
handholds
and
toeholds
and
using
them
to
propel
himself
onward
the
only
difference
was
that
he
covered
distance
a
great
deal
more
rapidly
than
a
mountain
climber
could
when
he
reached
the
spot
he
wanted
he
carefully
concealed
himself
beneath
a
craggy
overhang
it
took
a
little
searching
to
find
exactly
the
right
spot
but
when
he
did
he
settled
himself
into
place
in
a
small
pit
and
began
more
elaborate
preparations
required
nearly
ten
minutes
the
first
five
or
six
minutes
were
taken
up
in
relaxing
from
his
exertion
gravity
notwithstanding
he
had
had
to
push
his
hundred
and
eighty
pounds
of
mass
over
a
considerable
distance
when
he
was
completely
relaxed
and
completely
hypnotized
he
reached
up
and
cut
down
the
valve
that
fed
oxygen
into
his
suit
then
of
his
own
will
he
went
cataleptic
a
single
note
sounded
by
the
instruments
in
the
case
by
his
side
woke
him
instantly
he
came
fully
awake
as
he
had
commanded
himself
to
do
immediately
he
turned
up
his
oxygen
intake
at
the
same
time
glancing
at
the
clock
dial
in
his
helmet
he
smiled
nineteen
days
and
seven
hours
he
had
calculated
it
almost
precisely
he
was
more
than
an
hour
off
which
was
pretty
good
all
things
considered
he
consulted
his
instruments
again
the
supply
ship
was
ten
minutes
away
the
smile
stayed
on
his
face
as
he
prepared
for
further
action
the
first
two
minutes
were
conscientiously
spent
in
inhaling
oxygen
even
under
the
best
cataleptic
conditions
the
body
tended
to
slow
down
too
much
he
had
to
get
himself
prepared
for
violent
movement
eight
minutes
left
he
climbed
out
of
the
little
grotto
where
he
had
concealed
himself
and
moved
toward
the
spot
where
he
knew
the
air
lock
to
the
caverns
underneath
the
planetoid
surface
was
hidden
then
again
he
concealed
himself
and
waited
while
he
continued
to
breathe
deeply
of
the
highly
oxygenated
air
in
his
suit
five
minutes
before
the
ship
landed
he
swallowed
eight
ounces
of
the
nutrient
solution
from
the
tank
in
the
back
of
his
helmet
the
solution
of
amino
acids
vitamins
and
honey
sugar
also
contained
a
small
amount
of
stimulant
of
the
dexedrine
type
and
one
per
cent
ethanol
then
he
unholstered
his
gun
it
was
a
big
ship
he
had
known
it
would
be
it
was
only
a
little
larger
than
the
one
he
had
used
to
come
here
it
dropped
down
to
the
surface
of
the
small
planetoid
only
ten
meters
from
the
hidden
trapdoor
that
led
to
the
air
lock
beneath
the
surface
he
could
suddenly
hear
voices
in
the
earphones
of
his
helmet
me
fritz
i
got
your
supplies
and
good
the
air
lock
trapdoor
opened
and
a
spacesuited
figure
came
out
about
the
deal
the
good
news
said
the
second
suited
figure
as
it
came
from
the
air
lock
of
the
grounded
spaceboat
five
the
man
who
was
hidden
behind
the
nearby
crag
of
rock
listened
and
watched
for
a
minute
or
so
more
while
the
two
men
began
unloading
cases
of
foodstuffs
from
the
spaceboat
then
satisfied
that
it
was
perfectly
safe
he
aimed
his
gun
and
shot
twice
in
rapid
succession
the
range
was
almost
and
there
was
of
course
no
need
to
take
either
gravity
or
air
resistance
into
account
the
pellets
of
the
charge
that
blasted
out
from
the
gun
were
small
and
heavy
they
were
oriented
by
the
magnetic
field
along
the
barrel
of
the
weapon
of
the
hundreds
in
each
charge
fired
only
a
few
penetrated
the
spacesuits
of
the
targets
but
those
few
were
enough
the
powerful
drug
in
the
head
of
each
went
into
the
bloodstream
of
the
target
each
man
felt
an
itching
sensation
he
had
less
than
two
seconds
to
think
about
it
before
unconsciousness
overtook
him
and
he
slumped
nervelessly
the
man
with
the
gun
ran
across
the
intervening
space
quickly
his
body
only
a
few
degrees
from
the
horizontal
and
his
toes
paddling
rapidly
to
propel
him
over
the
rough
rock
he
braked
himself
to
a
halt
and
slapped
air
patches
over
the
area
where
his
charges
had
struck
the
men
suits
sealing
the
tiny
air
leaks
and
at
the
same
time
driving
more
of
the
tiny
needles
into
their
skins
they
would
be
out
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
had
yet
fallen
to
the
ground
that
would
take
several
minutes
under
this
low
gravity
he
left
them
to
drop
and
headed
toward
the
open
air
lock
this
was
what
he
had
been
waiting
for
all
those
nineteen
days
in
cataleptic
hypnosis
he
could
have
cut
his
way
in
from
the
outside
he
had
had
to
wait
until
it
was
opened
and
that
time
would
come
only
when
the
supply
ship
came
once
in
the
air
lock
he
touched
the
control
stud
that
would
close
the
outer
door
pump
air
into
the
waiting
room
and
open
the
inner
door
here
was
his
greatest
point
of
danger
greater
even
than
the
danger
of
coming
to
the
planetoid
or
the
danger
of
waiting
nineteen
days
for
the
coming
of
the
supply
ship
if
the
ones
who
remained
within
suspected
anything
anything
at
all
then
his
chances
of
coming
out
of
this
alive
were
practically
nil
but
there
was
no
reason
why
they
should
suspect
they
should
think
that
the
man
coming
in
was
one
of
their
own
the
radio
contact
between
the
men
outside
had
been
limited
to
a
few
millimicrowatts
of
power
necessarily
since
radio
waves
of
very
small
wattage
can
be
decoded
at
tremendous
distances
in
open
space
the
men
inside
the
planetoid
certainly
should
not
have
been
able
to
pick
up
any
more
than
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
before
it
had
been
cut
off
by
solid
rock
it
was
a
air
lock
unlike
the
soundless
discharge
of
his
special
gun
in
the
outer
airlessness
the
blast
of
air
that
came
into
the
waiting
chamber
was
like
a
hurricane
in
noise
and
force
as
the
room
filled
in
a
few
seconds
he
held
onto
the
handholds
tightly
while
the
brief
but
violent
winds
buffeted
him
he
turned
as
the
inner
door
opened
his
eyes
took
in
the
picture
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
in
an
even
smaller
fraction
his
mind
assimilated
the
picture
the
woman
was
and
muscular
her
mouth
was
wide
and
beneath
a
large
nose
the
man
was
leaner
and
lighter
and
the
woman
said
fritz
what
and
then
he
shot
them
both
with
gun
number
two
no
needle
charges
this
time
such
shots
would
have
blown
them
both
in
two
unprotected
as
they
were
by
spacesuits
the
small
handgun
merely
jangled
their
nerves
with
a
blast
of
accurately
beamed
supersonics
while
they
were
still
twitching
he
went
over
and
jabbed
them
with
a
drug
needle
then
he
went
on
into
the
hideout
he
had
to
knock
out
one
more
man
whom
he
found
sound
asleep
in
a
room
off
the
short
corridor
it
took
a
gas
bomb
to
get
the
two
women
who
were
guarding
the
kid
he
made
sure
that
the
benchaim
boy
was
all
right
then
he
went
to
the
little
communications
room
and
called
for
help
ix
colonel
walther
mannheim
tapped
the
map
that
glowed
on
the
wall
before
him
he
right
there
where
those
tunnels
come
together
bart
stanton
looked
at
the
map
of
manhattan
island
and
at
the
gleaming
colored
traceries
that
threaded
their
various
ways
across
it
just
what
was
the
purpose
of
those
tunnels
he
asked
curiously
they
were
for
rail
transportation
said
the
colonel
the
island
was
hit
by
a
sun
bomb
during
the
holocaust
and
almost
completely
leveled
and
slagged
down
when
the
city
was
rebuilt
there
was
naturally
no
need
for
such
things
so
they
were
simply
sealed
off
and
forgotten
right
under
government
city
stanton
said
incredible
it
used
to
be
one
of
the
largest
seaports
in
the
world
colonel
mannheim
said
and
it
probably
still
would
be
if
the
inertia
drive
had
made
air
travel
cheaper
and
easier
than
seagoing
how
did
he
find
out
about
the
tunnels
stanton
asked
the
colonel
pointed
at
the
north
end
of
the
island
after
the
holocaust
the
first
returnees
to
the
island
were
wild
animals
which
crossed
from
the
mainland
from
the
north
the
harlem
river
is
very
wide
at
this
point
also
because
of
the
rocky
hills
at
this
end
of
the
island
there
were
places
which
were
spared
the
direct
effects
of
the
bomb
and
grasses
and
trees
began
growing
there
that
why
it
was
decided
to
leave
that
section
as
a
game
preserve
when
the
government
built
the
capital
on
the
southern
part
of
the
island
his
finger
moved
down
the
map
the
upper
three
miles
of
the
island
down
to
here
where
it
begins
to
widen
are
all
game
preserve
there
a
high
wall
here
which
separates
it
from
the
city
and
the
ruins
of
the
bridges
which
connected
with
the
mainland
have
been
removed
so
the
animals
ca
get
back
across
any
more
two
years
after
he
arrived
the
nipe
was
almost
caught
he
had
managed
somehow
we
not
sure
yet
exactly
how
to
get
here
from
asia
according
to
the
psychologists
who
have
been
studying
him
he
apparently
does
not
believe
that
human
beings
are
any
more
than
trained
animals
he
was
looking
then
as
he
is
apparently
still
looking
for
the
rulers
of
earth
he
expected
to
find
them
of
course
in
government
city
needless
to
say
said
the
colonel
with
a
touch
of
irony
he
failed
but
he
was
seen
asked
stanton
he
was
seen
and
pursued
but
he
got
away
easily
heading
north
the
island
was
searched
and
the
police
were
ready
to
start
an
going
over
of
the
island
two
days
later
but
the
nipe
hit
and
robbed
a
chemical
supply
house
in
northern
pennsylvania
killing
two
men
so
the
search
was
called
off
illustration
it
was
until
two
years
later
after
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
pattern
of
his
raids
had
given
us
something
to
work
with
that
we
decided
that
he
must
have
found
an
opening
into
one
of
the
tunnels
up
here
in
the
game
preserve
he
gestured
again
at
the
map
it
would
take
him
long
to
see
that
no
human
being
had
been
down
there
in
a
long
time
it
was
a
perfect
place
for
his
base
how
does
he
move
in
and
out
stanton
asked
this
way
the
colonel
traced
a
finger
down
one
of
the
red
lines
on
the
map
southward
until
he
came
to
a
spot
only
a
little
over
two
miles
from
the
southernmost
tip
of
the
island
the
line
turned
abruptly
toward
the
western
edge
of
the
island
where
it
stopped
this
tunnel
goes
underneath
the
hudson
river
at
this
point
and
emerges
on
the
other
side
it
only
one
of
several
that
do
so
they
all
flooded
now
the
sun
bomb
caved
them
in
when
the
primary
shock
wave
hit
the
surface
of
the
river
in
spite
of
his
high
rate
of
metabolism
the
nipe
can
store
a
tremendous
amount
of
oxygen
in
his
body
and
can
stay
underwater
for
as
long
as
half
an
hour
without
breathing
apparatus
if
he
conserves
his
energy
when
wearing
his
scuba
apparatus
he
practically
a
submarine
the
pressure
does
seem
to
bother
him
much
he
a
tough
cookie
stanton
nodded
silently
and
slowly
could
he
beat
the
nipe
in
combat
there
would
be
no
way
of
knowing
until
the
final
moment
of
success
or
failure
at
that
time
the
colonel
went
on
we
had
formulated
any
definite
policy
on
the
nipe
we
did
know
what
he
was
up
to
we
were
even
sure
he
was
actually
down
in
those
tunnels
we
had
to
find
out
he
walked
over
to
the
nearby
table
and
opened
a
box
some
twelve
inches
long
and
inches
in
cross
section
see
this
he
said
as
he
took
something
out
it
looked
like
a
large
dead
rat
our
spy
said
colonel
mannheim
the
rat
moved
along
the
rusted
steel
rail
that
ran
the
length
of
the
huge
tunnel
to
a
human
being
the
tunnel
would
have
seemed
to
be
in
utter
darkness
but
the
little
eyes
of
the
rat
saw
its
surroundings
as
faintly
luminescent
glowing
from
the
radiations
given
out
by
the
internal
warmth
of
cement
and
steel
the
main
source
came
from
above
where
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
of
the
energy
sources
in
the
buildings
on
the
surface
seeped
through
the
roof
of
the
tunnel
on
and
on
it
moved
its
little
pinkish
feet
pattering
almost
silently
on
the
oxidized
metal
surface
of
the
rail
its
sensitive
ears
picked
up
the
movements
and
the
squeals
of
other
rats
but
it
paid
them
no
heed
several
times
it
met
other
rats
on
the
rail
but
most
of
them
sensed
the
alienness
of
rat
and
scuttled
out
of
its
way
once
it
met
a
rat
who
did
not
give
way
hungry
perhaps
or
perhaps
merely
yielding
to
the
paranoid
fury
that
was
a
normal
component
of
the
rattish
mind
it
squealed
its
defiance
to
the
rat
that
was
not
a
rat
it
advanced
baring
its
teeth
the
rat
that
was
not
a
rat
became
suddenly
motionless
its
sharp
nose
pointed
directly
at
the
enemy
there
came
a
noise
a
tiny
popping
hiss
like
that
of
a
very
small
drop
of
water
striking
hot
metal
from
the
left
nostril
of
the
a
tiny
glasslike
needle
snapped
out
at
bullet
speed
it
struck
the
advancing
rat
in
the
center
of
the
pink
tongue
that
was
visible
in
the
open
mouth
then
the
scuttled
backwards
faster
than
any
rat
could
have
moved
for
a
second
the
real
rat
hesitated
and
it
may
be
that
the
realization
penetrated
into
its
dim
brain
that
rats
did
not
fight
this
way
then
as
the
tiny
needle
dissolved
in
its
bloodstream
it
closed
its
eyes
and
collapsed
rolling
limply
off
the
rail
the
rat
might
come
to
before
it
was
found
and
devoured
by
its
fellows
or
it
might
not
the
moved
on
not
caring
either
way
the
human
intelligence
that
looked
out
from
the
eyes
of
the
was
only
concerned
with
getting
to
the
nipe
that
how
we
found
the
nipe
colonel
mannheim
said
and
that
how
we
keep
tabs
on
him
now
we
have
over
seven
hundred
of
these
robots
hidden
in
strategic
spots
in
those
tunnels
now
but
it
took
time
to
get
everything
set
up
this
way
now
we
can
follow
the
nipe
wherever
he
goes
so
long
as
he
stays
in
the
tunnels
if
he
went
out
through
an
open
air
exit
we
could
have
him
followed
by
but
he
shrugged
wryly
i
afraid
the
underwater
problem
still
has
us
stumped
we
ca
get
the
carrier
wave
for
the
impulses
to
go
far
underwater
how
do
you
get
your
carrier
wave
underground
to
those
tunnels
stanton
asked
the
colonel
grinned
widely
one
of
the
boys
dreamed
up
a
real
cute
gimmick
the
rails
themselves
act
as
antenna
for
the
broadcaster
and
the
rat
tail
is
the
pickup
antenna
as
long
as
the
rat
is
crawling
right
on
the
rail
only
a
microscopic
amount
of
power
is
needed
for
control
not
enough
for
the
nipe
to
pick
up
with
his
instruments
each
rat
carries
its
own
battery
for
motive
power
and
there
are
old
copper
power
cables
down
there
that
we
can
send
direct
current
through
to
recharge
the
batteries
and
when
we
need
them
the
copper
cables
can
be
used
as
antennas
it
took
us
quite
a
while
to
work
the
system
out
stanton
rubbed
his
head
thoughtfully
these
gaps
in
my
memory
he
thought
it
was
sometimes
embarrassing
to
ask
questions
that
any
schoolboy
should
know
are
there
ways
of
detecting
objects
underwater
he
asked
after
a
moment
yes
said
the
colonel
but
they
all
require
beamed
energy
of
some
kind
to
be
reflected
from
the
object
and
we
do
dare
use
anything
like
that
he
sat
down
on
one
corner
of
the
table
his
bright
blue
eyes
looking
up
at
stanton
that
been
our
problem
all
along
he
said
seriously
keeping
the
nipe
from
knowing
that
he
being
watched
in
the
tunnels
we
used
only
equipment
that
was
already
there
adding
only
what
we
absolutely
had
to
small
things
a
few
strands
of
wire
a
tiny
relay
things
that
can
be
hidden
in
out
of
the
way
places
after
all
he
has
his
own
alarm
system
in
the
maze
of
tunnels
and
we
deliberately
kept
away
from
his
detecting
devices
he
knows
about
the
rats
and
ignores
them
they
part
of
the
environment
but
we
do
dare
use
anything
that
would
tip
him
off
to
our
knowledge
of
his
whereabouts
one
slip
like
that
and
hundreds
of
human
beings
will
have
died
in
vain
and
if
he
stays
there
too
long
stanton
said
levelly
millions
more
may
die
the
colonel
face
was
grim
as
he
looked
directly
into
stanton
eyes
that
why
you
have
to
know
your
job
down
to
the
most
minute
detail
when
the
time
comes
to
act
the
whole
success
of
the
plan
will
depend
on
you
and
you
alone
stanton
eyes
did
avoid
the
colonel
not
true
he
thought
only
be
one
man
on
a
team
and
you
know
it
colonel
mannheim
but
you
like
to
shove
all
the
responsibility
off
onto
someone
else
someone
stronger
you
finally
met
someone
that
you
consider
superior
in
that
way
and
you
want
to
unload
i
wish
i
felt
as
confident
as
you
do
but
i
aloud
he
said
sure
nothing
to
it
all
i
have
to
do
is
take
into
account
everything
that
known
about
the
nipe
and
make
allowances
for
everything
that
not
known
then
he
smiled
not
he
added
that
i
can
think
of
any
other
way
to
go
about
it
x
louis
had
been
hit
during
the
holocaust
it
still
retained
much
of
the
flavor
of
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
especially
in
the
residential
districts
bart
stanton
liked
to
walk
along
those
quiet
streets
of
an
evening
just
to
let
the
peacefulness
seep
into
him
and
knowing
it
was
rather
childish
he
still
enjoyed
the
small
pleasure
of
playing
hookey
from
the
neurophysics
institute
technically
he
supposed
he
was
still
a
patient
there
more
now
that
he
had
accepted
colonel
mannheim
assignment
he
was
presumably
under
military
discipline
but
he
assumed
that
if
he
had
asked
permission
to
leave
the
institute
grounds
he
would
have
been
given
that
permission
without
question
but
like
playing
hookey
or
stealing
watermelon
it
was
more
fun
if
it
was
done
on
the
sly
the
boy
who
comes
home
feeling
deliciously
wicked
and
delightfully
sinful
after
staying
away
from
school
all
day
can
have
his
whole
day
ruined
by
being
told
that
it
was
a
holiday
and
that
the
school
had
been
closed
bart
stanton
did
want
to
spoil
his
own
fun
by
asking
for
permission
to
leave
the
grounds
when
it
was
so
easy
for
a
man
with
his
special
abilities
to
get
out
without
asking
besides
there
a
chance
a
small
one
he
thought
that
permission
might
be
refused
for
one
reason
or
another
and
bart
was
fully
aware
that
he
would
not
disobey
a
direct
request
to
say
nothing
of
a
direct
order
that
he
stay
within
the
walls
of
the
institute
he
did
want
to
run
any
risk
of
losing
his
freedom
small
though
it
was
after
five
years
of
mental
and
physical
hell
he
felt
a
need
to
get
out
into
the
world
of
normal
everyday
people
his
legs
moved
smoothly
surely
and
unhurriedly
carrying
him
aimlessly
along
the
resilient
walkway
under
the
warm
glow
of
the
street
lights
the
people
around
him
walked
as
casually
and
with
seemingly
as
little
purpose
as
he
did
there
was
none
of
the
brisk
sense
of
urgency
that
he
felt
inside
the
walls
of
the
institute
he
knew
he
could
never
get
away
from
that
sense
of
urgency
completely
even
out
here
there
were
times
when
it
seemed
that
all
he
had
ever
done
all
his
life
was
to
train
himself
for
the
single
purpose
of
besting
the
nipe
if
he
was
training
physically
he
was
listening
to
lectures
from
the
psychologists
or
from
colonel
mannheim
laying
plans
and
considering
possibilities
for
the
one
great
goal
that
seemed
to
be
the
focal
point
of
his
whole
life
what
would
happen
if
he
failed
he
would
die
of
course
and
plan
beta
would
immediately
go
into
effect
the
nipe
would
be
killed
eventually
but
what
if
he
stanton
won
then
what
the
people
around
him
were
not
a
part
of
his
world
really
their
thoughts
their
motions
their
reactions
were
slow
and
clumsy
in
comparison
with
his
own
once
the
nipe
had
been
conquered
what
purpose
would
there
be
in
the
life
of
bartholomew
stanton
he
was
surrounded
by
people
but
he
was
not
one
of
them
he
was
immersed
in
a
society
that
was
not
his
own
because
it
was
not
could
not
be
geared
to
his
abilities
and
potentials
but
there
was
no
other
society
to
turn
to
either
he
was
not
a
man
alone
afraid
in
a
world
he
had
never
made
he
was
a
man
who
had
been
made
for
a
world
a
society
that
did
not
exist
women
a
wife
a
family
life
where
with
whom
he
pushed
the
thoughts
from
his
mind
the
questions
unanswered
and
perhaps
unanswerable
in
spite
of
the
apparent
bleakness
of
the
future
he
had
no
desire
to
die
and
there
was
the
possibility
that
too
much
brooding
of
that
kind
would
evoke
a
subconscious
reaction
that
could
slow
him
down
or
cause
a
wrong
decision
at
a
vital
moment
a
feeling
of
futility
could
operate
to
bring
on
his
death
in
spite
of
his
conscious
determination
to
win
the
coming
battle
with
the
nipe
the
nipe
was
his
first
duty
when
that
job
was
finished
he
would
consider
the
problem
of
himself
just
because
he
could
not
now
see
the
answer
to
that
problem
did
not
mean
that
no
answer
existed
he
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
hungry
he
had
been
walking
through
memorial
park
past
the
museum
an
old
worn
edifice
that
was
still
called
the
missouri
pacific
building
there
was
a
small
restaurant
only
a
block
away
he
reached
into
his
pocket
and
took
out
the
few
coins
that
were
there
not
much
but
enough
to
buy
a
sandwich
and
a
glass
of
milk
because
of
the
trust
fund
that
had
been
set
up
when
he
had
started
the
treatment
at
the
neurophysics
institute
he
was
already
well
off
but
he
did
have
much
cash
what
good
was
cash
in
the
institute
where
everything
was
provided
he
stopped
at
a
dropped
in
a
coin
and
waited
for
the
reproducing
mechanism
to
turn
out
a
fresh
paper
then
he
took
the
folded
sheets
and
went
on
to
the
restaurant
he
rarely
read
a
mostly
his
information
about
the
world
that
existed
outside
the
walls
of
the
institute
came
from
the
televised
newscasts
but
occasionally
he
liked
to
read
the
small
relatively
unimportant
little
stories
about
people
who
had
done
small
relatively
unimportant
things
stories
that
did
appear
in
the
headlines
or
on
the
newscasts
the
last
important
news
story
had
come
two
nights
before
when
the
nipe
had
robbed
an
optical
products
company
in
miami
the
camera
had
shown
the
shop
on
the
screen
whatever
had
been
used
to
blow
open
the
door
of
the
vault
had
been
more
effective
than
necessary
it
had
taken
the
whole
front
door
of
the
shop
and
both
windows
too
the
bent
and
twisted
paraglass
that
had
lain
on
the
pavement
showed
how
much
force
had
been
applied
from
within
and
yet
the
results
were
not
that
of
an
explosion
it
was
more
as
though
some
tremendous
force
had
outward
from
within
it
had
not
been
the
shattering
shock
of
high
explosive
but
some
great
thrust
that
had
unhurriedly
but
irresistibly
moved
everything
out
of
its
way
nothing
had
been
moved
very
far
as
it
would
have
been
by
a
blast
it
appeared
that
everything
had
simply
fallen
aside
as
though
scattered
by
a
giant
hand
the
main
braces
of
the
store
front
were
still
there
bent
outward
a
little
but
not
broken
the
vault
door
had
lain
on
the
floor
of
the
shop
only
a
few
feet
from
the
front
door
the
vault
itself
had
been
farther
back
and
the
camera
had
showed
it
standing
wide
open
gaping
inside
there
had
been
pieces
of
fragile
glass
standing
on
the
shelves
unmoved
unharmed
the
force
whatever
it
had
been
had
moved
in
one
direction
only
from
a
point
within
the
vault
just
a
few
feet
from
the
door
pushing
outward
to
tear
out
the
heavy
door
as
though
it
had
been
made
of
paraffin
or
modeling
clay
stanton
had
recognized
the
vault
construction
type
the
voisier
construction
which
by
test
could
withstand
almost
everything
known
outside
of
the
actual
application
of
atomic
energy
itself
in
a
demonstration
several
years
before
a
voisier
vault
had
been
cut
open
by
a
team
of
technicians
it
had
taken
hours
for
them
to
breach
the
wall
and
they
had
no
fear
of
interruption
or
of
making
a
noise
or
of
setting
off
the
intricate
alarms
that
were
built
into
the
safe
itself
not
even
a
borazon
drill
could
make
much
of
an
impression
on
a
metal
which
had
been
formed
under
millions
of
atmospheres
of
pressure
and
yet
the
nipe
had
taken
that
door
out
in
a
second
without
much
effort
at
all
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
had
not
been
large
the
very
thought
of
the
nipe
kept
people
away
from
places
where
he
was
known
to
have
been
the
specter
of
the
nipe
evoked
a
fear
a
primitive
fear
fear
of
the
dark
and
fear
of
the
unknown
combined
with
the
rational
fear
of
a
very
real
very
tangible
danger
and
yet
there
been
a
crowd
of
onlookers
in
spite
of
their
fear
it
is
hard
to
keep
human
beings
from
being
curious
it
was
known
that
the
nipe
did
stay
around
after
he
had
struck
and
besides
the
area
was
now
full
of
armed
men
so
the
curious
came
to
look
and
to
stare
in
revulsion
at
the
neat
pile
of
gnawed
and
bloody
bones
that
had
been
the
night
watchman
carefully
killed
and
eaten
by
the
nipe
before
he
had
opened
the
vault
curiosity
does
make
fools
of
us
all
and
the
native
hue
of
caution
is
crimsoned
by
the
bright
red
of
morbid
stanton
went
through
the
door
of
the
automat
restaurant
and
walked
over
to
the
vending
wall
the
dining
room
was
only
about
full
of
people
there
were
plenty
of
seats
available
he
fed
coins
into
the
proper
slots
took
his
sandwich
and
milk
over
to
a
seat
in
one
corner
and
made
himself
comfortable
he
flipped
open
the
newspaper
and
looked
at
the
front
page
and
for
a
moment
his
brain
seemed
to
freeze
the
story
itself
was
straightforward
enough
benchaim
kidnapers
nabbed
stan
martin
does
it
again
ceres
june
interplanetary
news
service
the
three
men
and
three
women
who
allegedly
kidnapped
shmuel
benchaim
were
brought
to
justice
today
through
the
efforts
of
stanley
martin
famed
investigator
for
lloyd
of
london
the
boy
held
prisoner
for
more
than
ten
months
on
a
small
asteroid
was
reported
in
very
good
health
according
to
john
vale
of
the
planetoid
police
the
kidnap
gang
could
not
have
been
taken
by
direct
assault
on
their
hideout
because
of
fear
that
the
boy
might
be
killed
the
operation
required
a
infiltration
of
their
hideout
he
said
martin
was
the
man
for
the
job
labeled
the
most
outrageous
kidnapping
in
history
the
affair
was
conceived
as
a
method
of
gaining
control
of
heavy
metals
incorporated
controlled
by
moishe
benchaim
the
boy
father
the
details
but
bart
stanton
was
interested
in
the
details
after
only
a
glance
through
the
first
part
of
the
article
his
eyes
returned
to
the
picture
alongside
the
article
the
line
of
print
beneath
it
identified
the
man
in
the
picture
as
stanley
martin
but
a
voice
in
bart
stanton
brain
said
stan
martin
the
name
is
mart
stanton
and
bartholomew
felt
a
roar
of
confusion
in
his
mind
because
he
know
who
mart
stanton
was
and
because
the
face
in
the
picture
was
his
own
xi
he
was
walking
again
he
did
quite
remember
how
he
had
left
the
automat
and
he
did
even
try
to
remember
he
was
trying
to
remember
other
things
farther
back
before
he
had
before
he
had
what
before
the
institute
before
the
beginning
of
the
operations
the
memories
were
there
just
beyond
the
grasp
of
his
conscious
mind
like
the
memories
of
a
dream
after
one
has
awakened
each
time
he
tried
to
reach
into
the
darkness
to
grasp
one
of
the
pieces
it
would
break
up
into
smaller
bits
the
patterns
were
too
fragile
to
withstand
the
direct
probing
of
his
conscious
mind
only
the
resulting
fragments
held
together
long
enough
to
be
analyzed
and
while
part
of
his
mind
probed
frantically
after
the
elusive
particles
of
memory
another
part
of
it
watched
the
process
with
amusement
he
had
always
known
there
were
holes
in
his
memory
do
be
silly
pal
but
it
was
disconcerting
to
find
an
area
that
was
as
riddled
as
a
used
target
the
whole
fabric
had
been
punched
to
bits
no
man
memory
is
completely
available
at
any
given
time
however
it
is
recorded
however
completely
every
bit
of
data
may
be
recorded
during
a
lifetime
much
of
it
is
unavailable
because
it
is
incompletely
or
in
some
cases
labeled
not
or
metaphorically
the
file
drawer
may
be
locked
it
may
be
that
in
many
cases
if
a
given
bit
of
data
remains
unscanned
long
enough
it
fades
into
illegibility
never
reinforced
by
the
scanning
process
sensory
data
coming
in
from
the
outside
world
as
it
does
is
probably
permanent
but
the
thought
patterns
originating
within
the
mind
itself
the
processes
that
correlate
and
and
speculate
on
and
hypothesize
about
the
sensory
data
those
are
much
more
fragile
a
man
might
glance
once
through
a
latin
primer
and
have
every
page
imprinted
indelibly
on
his
recording
mechanism
and
still
be
unable
to
make
sense
of
the
in
cubito
cum
puella
sometimes
a
man
is
aware
of
the
holes
in
his
memory
what
was
the
name
of
that
fellow
i
met
at
eddie
party
ca
remember
it
for
the
life
of
me
at
other
times
a
memory
may
lay
dormant
and
unremembered
leaving
no
apparent
gap
until
a
tag
of
some
kind
brings
it
up
that
girl
with
the
long
hair
reminds
me
of
suzie
blugerhugle
my
gosh
i
have
thought
of
her
for
years
both
factors
seemed
to
be
operating
in
bart
mind
at
this
time
incredibly
he
had
never
in
the
past
year
at
least
had
occasion
to
try
to
remember
much
about
his
past
life
he
had
known
who
he
was
without
thinking
about
it
particularly
and
the
rest
of
his
knowledge
language
history
politics
geography
and
so
on
had
been
readily
available
for
the
most
part
ask
any
educated
man
to
give
the
product
of
the
primes
and
or
ask
him
to
give
the
date
of
the
norman
conquest
and
he
can
give
the
answer
without
having
to
think
of
where
he
learned
it
or
who
taught
it
to
him
or
when
he
got
the
information
but
now
the
picture
and
the
name
in
the
paper
had
brought
forth
a
reaction
in
stanton
mind
and
he
was
trying
desperately
to
bring
the
information
out
of
oblivion
did
he
have
a
mother
surely
but
could
he
remember
her
certainly
a
pretty
gentle
rather
sad
woman
he
could
remember
when
she
had
died
although
he
could
remember
ever
having
attended
the
funeral
what
about
his
father
he
could
find
no
memory
of
his
father
and
at
first
that
bothered
him
he
could
remember
his
mother
could
almost
see
her
moving
around
in
the
apartment
where
they
had
lived
in
in
in
denver
sure
and
he
could
remember
the
building
itself
and
the
block
and
even
frobisher
who
lived
upstairs
and
the
school
a
great
many
memories
came
crowding
back
but
there
was
no
trace
of
his
father
and
yet
oh
of
his
father
had
been
killed
in
an
accident
when
martinbart
were
very
young
illustration
the
name
flitted
through
his
mind
like
a
scrap
of
paper
in
a
high
wind
but
he
reached
out
and
grasped
it
martinbart
mart
bart
mart
bart
the
stanton
twins
it
was
curious
he
thought
that
he
should
have
forgotten
his
brother
and
even
more
curious
that
the
name
in
the
paper
had
not
brought
him
instantly
to
mind
martin
the
cripple
martin
the
boy
with
the
nervous
system
the
boy
who
had
had
to
stay
in
a
therapy
chair
all
his
life
because
his
efferent
nerves
could
not
control
his
body
the
boy
who
could
speak
or
rather
speak
because
he
was
ashamed
of
the
gibberish
that
resulted
martin
the
nonentity
the
nothing
the
nobody
the
one
who
watched
and
listened
and
thought
but
could
do
nothing
bart
stanton
stopped
suddenly
and
unfolded
the
newspaper
again
under
the
glow
of
the
street
lamp
his
memories
certainly
did
gibe
with
his
eyes
ran
down
the
column
of
type
martin
has
in
the
eighteen
months
since
he
came
to
the
belt
run
up
an
enviable
record
both
as
an
insurance
investigator
and
as
a
police
detective
although
his
connection
with
the
planetoid
police
is
necessarily
an
unofficial
one
probably
not
since
sherlock
holmes
has
there
been
such
mutual
respect
and
between
the
official
police
and
a
private
investigator
the
was
only
one
explanation
stanton
thought
martin
too
had
been
treated
by
the
institute
his
memory
was
still
blurry
and
incomplete
but
he
did
suddenly
remember
that
a
decision
had
been
made
for
martin
to
take
the
treatment
he
chuckled
a
little
at
the
irony
of
it
they
had
been
able
to
make
a
superman
of
martin
but
they
been
able
to
make
a
normal
and
extraordinarily
capable
man
of
him
now
it
was
bart
who
was
the
freak
the
odd
one
about
is
fair
play
he
thought
but
somehow
it
did
seem
quite
fair
he
crumpled
the
newspaper
dropped
it
into
a
nearby
waste
chute
and
walked
on
through
the
night
toward
the
neurophysical
institute
xii
interlude
you
understand
stanton
said
the
psychiatrist
that
a
great
part
of
martin
trouble
is
mental
as
much
as
physical
because
of
the
nature
of
his
ailment
he
has
withdrawn
pulled
himself
away
from
communication
with
others
if
these
symptoms
had
been
brought
to
my
attention
earlier
the
mental
disturbance
might
have
been
more
easily
analyzed
and
treated
i
sorry
doctor
said
stanton
her
manner
betrayed
weariness
and
pain
it
was
so
so
difficult
martin
could
never
talk
very
well
you
know
and
he
just
talked
less
and
less
as
the
years
went
by
it
was
so
gradual
that
i
never
really
noticed
it
the
doctor
thought
not
well
herself
she
should
have
married
again
rather
than
carry
the
whole
burden
alone
her
role
as
a
doting
mother
has
helped
either
of
the
boys
to
overcome
the
handicaps
that
were
already
i
tried
to
do
my
best
for
martin
stanton
went
on
unhappily
and
so
has
bart
when
they
were
younger
bart
used
to
take
him
out
all
the
time
they
went
everywhere
together
of
course
i
do
expect
bart
to
do
that
so
much
any
more
he
has
his
own
life
to
live
he
ca
take
martin
out
on
dates
or
things
like
that
but
when
he
home
bart
helps
me
with
martin
all
the
time
i
understand
said
the
doctor
is
no
time
to
tell
her
that
bartholomew
tests
indicate
that
he
has
subconsciously
resented
presence
for
a
long
time
she
has
enough
to
worry
i
do
understand
said
stanton
breaking
into
sudden
tears
i
do
understand
why
martin
should
behave
this
way
why
should
he
just
sit
there
with
his
eyes
closed
and
ignore
us
both
the
doctor
comforted
her
in
a
warmly
professional
manner
then
as
her
tears
subsided
he
said
we
do
understand
all
of
the
factors
ourselves
stanton
martin
reactions
are
i
admit
unusual
his
behavior
does
quite
follow
the
pattern
that
we
usually
expect
from
such
cases
as
this
his
physical
disability
has
drastically
modified
the
course
of
his
mental
development
and
at
the
same
time
makes
it
difficult
for
us
to
make
any
analysis
of
is
mental
state
is
there
you
can
do
doctor
we
do
know
yet
he
said
gently
he
considered
for
a
moment
then
said
stanton
i
like
for
you
to
leave
both
the
boys
here
for
a
few
days
so
that
we
can
perform
further
tests
that
will
help
us
a
great
deal
in
getting
at
the
root
of
martin
trouble
she
looked
at
him
with
a
little
surprise
why
yes
of
course
but
why
should
bart
stay
the
doctor
weighed
his
words
carefully
before
he
spoke
bart
is
our
control
stanton
since
the
boys
are
genetically
identical
they
should
have
been
a
great
deal
alike
in
personality
if
it
had
been
for
martin
accident
in
other
words
our
tests
of
bart
will
tell
us
what
martin
be
like
that
way
we
can
tell
just
how
much
and
in
what
way
martin
deviates
from
what
he
should
ideally
be
do
you
understand
yes
yes
i
see
all
right
doctor
whatever
you
say
after
stanton
had
left
the
psychiatrist
sat
quietly
in
his
chair
and
stared
thoughtfully
at
his
desk
top
for
several
minutes
then
making
his
decision
he
picked
up
a
small
book
that
lay
on
his
desk
and
looked
up
a
number
in
arlington
virginia
he
punched
out
the
number
on
his
phone
and
when
the
face
appeared
on
his
screen
he
said
hello
sidney
look
i
have
a
very
interesting
case
out
here
that
i
like
to
talk
to
you
about
do
you
happen
to
have
a
telepath
who
strong
enough
to
take
a
meshing
with
an
insane
mind
if
my
suspicions
are
correct
i
need
a
man
with
an
impregnable
sense
of
identity
because
he
going
to
get
into
the
weirdest
situation
i
ever
come
across
xiii
pok

pok

the
action
in
the
handball
court
was
beautiful
to
watch
the
robot
mechanism
behind
bart
stanton
would
fire
out
a
ball
at
random
intervals
ranging
from
a
tenth
to
a
quarter
of
a
second
bouncing
them
off
the
wall
in
a
random
pattern
stanton
would
retrieve
the
ball
before
it
hit
the
ground
bounce
it
off
the
wall
again
to
strike
the
target
on
the
moving
robot
stanton
had
to
work
against
a
machine
no
ordinary
human
being
could
have
given
him
any
competition
pok
ping
pok
ping
pok
one
miss
stanton
said
to
himself
but
he
fielded
the
next
one
nicely
and
slammed
it
home
pok
ping
the
physical
therapist
who
was
standing
by
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
time
pok
ping
the
machine
having
delivered
its
last
ball
shut
itself
off
with
a
smug
click
stanton
turned
away
from
the
handball
court
and
walked
toward
the
physical
therapist
who
held
out
a
robe
for
him
that
was
good
bart
he
said
real
good
one
miss
stanton
said
as
he
shrugged
into
the
robe
yeah
your
timing
was
a
shade
off
there
i
guess
but
you
ran
a
full
minute
over
your
previous
record
stanton
looked
at
him
you
the
timer
again
he
said
accusingly
but
there
was
a
grin
on
his
face
the
man
grinned
back
yup
come
on
step
into
the
mummy
case
he
waved
toward
the
narrow
niche
in
the
wall
of
the
court
a
niche
just
big
enough
to
hold
a
standing
man
stanton
stepped
in
and
various
instrument
came
out
of
the
walls
and
touched
his
body
hidden
machines
recorded
his
heartbeat
blood
pressure
brain
activity
muscular
tension
and
several
other
factors
after
a
minute
the
man
said
bart
let
hit
the
steam
box
stanton
stepped
out
of
the
niche
and
accompanied
the
therapist
to
another
room
where
he
took
off
the
robe
again
and
sat
down
on
the
small
stool
inside
an
ordinary
steam
box
the
box
closed
leaving
his
head
free
and
the
box
began
to
fill
with
steam
did
i
ever
tell
you
what
i
do
like
about
that
machine
bart
asked
as
the
therapist
draped
a
heavy
towel
around
his
head
nope
did
know
you
had
any
gripe
what
is
it
you
ca
gloat
after
you
beat
it
you
ca
walk
over
and
pat
it
on
the
shoulder
and
say
better
luck
next
time
old
man
it
is
a
good
loser
and
it
is
a
bad
loser
the
damn
thing
does
even
know
it
lost
and
if
it
did
it
would
care
i
see
what
you
mean
said
the
man
chuckling
you
beat
the
pants
off
it
and
what
get
not
even
a
case
of
the
sulks
out
of
it
exactly
and
what
worse
i
know
perfectly
good
and
well
that
it
only
half
trying
the
damned
thing
could
beat
me
easily
if
you
just
turned
that
knob
over
a
little
more
you
not
competing
against
the
machine
anyway
the
therapist
said
you
competing
against
yourself
trying
to
beat
your
own
record
i
know
and
what
happens
when
i
ca
do
any
more
either
stanton
asked
i
ca
just
go
on
getting
better
and
better
forever
got
limits
you
know
sure
said
the
therapist
easily
so
does
a
golf
player
but
every
golfer
goes
out
and
practices
by
himself
to
try
to
beat
his
own
record
bunk
the
real
fun
in
game
is
beating
someone
else
the
big
kick
in
golf
is
in
winning
over
the
other
guy
in
a
twosome
how
about
crossword
puzzles
or
solitaire
solve
a
crossword
puzzle
and
you
beaten
the
guy
who
made
it
up
in
solitaire
you
playing
against
the
laws
of
chance
and
even
that
can
become
pretty
boring
what
i
like
to
do
is
get
out
on
the
golf
course
with
someone
else
and
do
my
best
and
then
lose
honestly
with
a
handicap
the
therapist
began
then
he
grinned
weakly
and
stopped
on
the
golf
course
stanton
was
impossibly
good
one
long
drive
to
the
green
one
putt
to
the
cup
an
easy
strokes
for
eighteen
holes
an
occasional
sometimes
brought
him
below
that
an
occasional
or
stray
wind
sometimes
raised
his
score
sure
stanton
said
a
handicap
what
kind
of
handicap
do
you
want
on
a
handball
game
with
me
the
man
could
imagine
himself
trying
to
get
under
one
of
returns
the
thought
of
what
would
happen
to
his
hand
if
he
were
to
accidentally
catch
one
made
him
wince
we
would
even
be
playing
the
same
game
stanton
said
the
therapist
stepped
back
and
looked
at
stanton
you
know
he
said
puzzledly
you
sound
bitter
sure
i
bitter
stanton
said
all
i
get
is
exercise
all
the
fun
has
gone
out
of
it
he
sighed
and
grinned
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
the
man
i
just
have
to
stick
to
cards
and
chess
if
i
want
competition
speed
and
strength
do
help
anything
if
i
holding
two
pair
against
three
of
a
kind
before
the
therapist
could
say
anything
the
door
opened
and
a
tall
lean
man
stepped
into
the
room
you
are
broiling
a
lobster
he
asked
the
blandly
steaming
a
clam
came
the
correction
when
he
done
i
pound
him
to
chowder
excellent
i
came
for
a
the
tall
man
said
you
early
then
george
stanton
said
he
did
feel
in
the
mood
for
light
humor
and
the
appearance
of
yoritomo
did
nothing
to
improve
his
humor
george
yoritomo
beamed
crinkling
up
his
eyes
ah
a
talking
clam
excellent
how
much
longer
does
he
have
to
cook
minutes
why
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
return
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
therapist
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
opened
it
again
and
said
sure
doc
i
can
get
some
other
stuff
done
i
see
you
then
i
be
back
bart
he
went
out
through
the
far
door
after
the
door
closed
yoritomo
pulled
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
new
developments
he
said
as
you
may
have
surmised
i
guessed
stanton
said
what
is
it
he
flexed
his
muscles
under
the
caress
of
the
hot
moist
currents
in
the
box
he
wondered
why
it
was
so
important
that
the
psychologist
interrupt
him
while
he
was
relaxing
after
strenuous
exercise
yoritomo
looked
excited
in
spite
of
his
calm
and
yet
stanton
knew
that
there
could
be
anything
urgent
or
yoritomo
would
have
acted
differently
it
was
relatively
unimportant
now
anyway
stanton
thought
having
made
his
decision
to
act
on
his
own
had
changed
his
reaction
to
the
decisions
of
others
yoritomo
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
his
thin
lips
in
an
excited
smile
his
eyes
sparkling
i
had
to
come
tell
you
the
sheer
utter
beauty
of
it
is
too
much
to
contain
three
times
in
a
row
was
almost
absolute
bart
the
probability
that
our
hypothesis
is
correct
was
computed
as
straight
nines
to
seven
decimals
but
now
the
fourth
time
straight
nines
to
decimals
scanton
lifted
an
eyebrow
your
oriental
calm
is
deserting
you
george
i
not
reading
you
yoritomo
smile
became
broader
ah
sorry
i
refer
to
the
theory
we
have
been
discussing
about
the
memory
of
the
nipe
you
know
stanton
knew
yoritomo
was
in
effect
one
of
his
training
instructors
alien
psychology
stanton
thought
course
the
mental
whys
wherefores
of
the
nipe
or
how
to
outthink
the
enemy
in
twelve
easy
lessons
instructor
george
after
six
years
of
watching
the
recorded
actions
of
the
nipe
yoritomo
had
evolved
a
theory
about
the
kind
of
mentality
that
lay
behind
the
four
baleful
violet
eyes
in
that
alien
head
now
he
evidently
had
proof
of
that
theory
he
was
smiling
and
rubbing
his
long
bony
hands
together
for
george
yoritomo
that
was
the
equivalent
of
hysterical
excitement
we
have
been
able
to
predict
the
behavior
of
the
nipe
he
said
for
the
fourth
time
in
succession
great
but
how
does
that
fit
in
with
that
rule
you
once
told
me
about
you
know
the
one
about
experimental
animals
ah
yes
the
harvard
law
genetically
standardized
strain
under
precisely
controlled
laboratory
conditions
when
subjected
to
carefully
calibrated
stimuli
will
behave
as
it
damned
well
pleases
yes
very
true
but
an
animal
could
not
do
otherwise
could
it
only
as
it
pleases
and
it
could
not
please
to
behave
as
something
it
is
not
could
it
draw
me
a
picture
stanton
said
i
mean
that
any
organism
is
limited
in
its
choice
of
behavior
a
hamster
for
instance
can
not
choose
to
behave
in
the
manner
of
a
rhesus
monkey
a
dog
can
not
choose
to
react
as
a
mouse
would
if
i
prick
a
rat
with
a
needle
it
may
squeal
or
bite
or
jump
but
it
will
not
bark
never
nor
will
it
leap
up
to
a
trapeze
hang
by
its
tail
and
chatter
curses
at
me
never
by
observing
an
organism
reactions
one
can
begin
to
see
a
pattern
if
you
tell
me
that
you
put
an
armful
of
hay
into
a
certain
enclosure
and
that
the
animal
trotted
over
ate
the
hay
and
brayed
i
can
tell
you
with
reasonable
certainty
that
the
animal
has
long
ears
do
you
see
you
have
been
able
to
pinpoint
the
nipe
that
easily
have
you
stanton
asked
ah
no
the
more
intelligent
a
creature
is
the
greater
its
scope
of
action
the
nipe
is
far
from
being
so
simple
as
a
monkey
or
a
hamster
on
the
other
hand
he
smiled
widely
showing
bright
white
he
is
not
so
bright
as
a
human
being
i
would
say
he
was
exactly
stupid
george
what
about
all
those
prize
gadgets
of
his
he
blinked
wipe
the
sweat
off
my
forehead
will
you
it
running
into
my
eyes
yoritomo
wiped
with
the
towel
as
he
continued
ah
yes
he
is
quite
capable
in
that
respect
my
friend
it
is
his
great
memory
at
once
his
finest
asset
and
his
greatest
curse
he
draped
the
towel
around
stanton
head
again
and
stepped
back
his
face
unsmiling
imagine
having
a
memory
stanton
jaw
muscles
tightened
i
think
i
like
it
yoritomo
shrugged
slightly
perhaps
you
would
but
it
would
not
be
the
asset
you
think
look
at
it
soberly
my
friend
the
most
difficult
teaching
job
in
the
universe
is
the
attempt
to
teach
an
organism
something
it
already
knows
true
yes
if
a
man
already
knows
the
shape
of
the
earth
it
will
do
you
no
good
to
attempt
to
teach
him
if
he
that
the
earth
is
flat
your
contention
that
it
is
round
will
make
no
impression
whatever
he
you
see
he
now
imagine
a
race
with
a
perfect
memory
one
which
does
not
fade
a
memory
in
which
each
bit
of
data
is
as
bright
and
fresh
as
the
moment
it
was
imprinted
and
as
readily
available
as
the
data
stored
in
a
mind
it
is
in
effect
a
robotic
memory
if
you
put
false
data
into
the
memory
bank
of
a
computer
such
as
telling
it
that
the
square
of
two
is
five
you
can
not
correct
the
error
simply
by
telling
it
that
the
square
of
two
is
four
you
must
first
remove
the
erroneous
data
not
so
very
good
then
let
us
look
at
the
nipe
race
wherever
it
was
spawned
in
this
universe
let
us
look
at
their
race
a
long
time
back
when
they
first
became
back
when
they
first
developed
a
true
language
each
child
as
it
is
born
or
hatched
or
budded
whatever
it
is
they
do
is
taught
as
rapidly
as
possible
all
the
things
it
must
know
to
survive
and
once
it
is
taught
a
thing
it
and
if
it
is
taught
a
falsehood
then
it
can
not
be
taught
the
truth
would
cold
reality
force
a
change
stanton
asked
ah
in
some
cases
yes
in
most
no
look
suppose
a
primordial
nipe
runs
across
a
tiger
or
whatever
passes
for
a
tiger
on
their
planet
he
has
never
seen
a
tiger
before
so
he
does
not
see
that
this
particular
tiger
is
old
ill
and
weak
he
hits
it
on
the
head
and
it
drops
dead
he
takes
it
home
for
the
family
to
feed
on
did
you
kill
it
papa
walked
up
to
it
bashed
it
on
the
noggin
and
it
died
that
is
the
way
to
kill
tigers
yoritomo
smiled
it
is
also
a
good
way
to
kill
nipes
eh
he
took
the
towel
and
wiped
stanton
brow
again
illustration
the
error
he
continued
was
made
when
papa
nipe
generalized
from
tiger
to
tigers
if
tigers
were
rare
this
bit
of
lore
might
be
passed
on
for
many
generations
those
who
learned
that
most
tigers
are
conquered
by
walking
up
to
them
and
hitting
them
on
the
noggin
undoubtedly
died
before
they
could
pass
this
bit
of
information
on
then
one
day
a
nipe
survived
the
ordeal
his
mind
now
contained
conflicting
information
which
must
be
resolved
he
that
tigers
are
killed
in
this
way
he
also
that
this
one
did
not
die
plainly
then
one
is
not
a
tiger
ha
he
has
the
solution
what
does
he
tell
his
children
why
first
he
tells
them
how
tigers
are
killed
then
he
warns
them
that
there
is
an
animal
that
looks
a
tiger
but
is
a
tiger
one
should
not
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
it
a
tiger
or
one
will
get
badly
hurt
since
the
only
way
to
tell
the
true
tiger
from
the
false
is
to
hit
it
and
since
that
test
may
prove
fatal
to
the
nipe
who
tries
it
it
follows
that
one
is
better
off
if
one
avoids
all
animals
that
look
like
tigers
you
see
yeah
said
stanton
some
snarks
are
boojums
exactly
thank
you
for
that
allusion
i
must
remember
to
use
it
in
my
report
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
stanton
said
musingly
that
there
would
be
some
things
that
they
never
learn
the
truth
about
once
they
gotten
a
wrong
idea
in
their
heads
ah
indeed
it
is
precisely
that
which
led
me
to
formulate
my
theory
in
the
first
place
how
else
to
explain
the
fact
that
the
nipe
for
all
his
technical
knowledge
is
still
in
the
ancient
stage
of
development
a
savage
yoritomo
smiled
as
to
his
savagery
i
think
no
one
on
earth
would
disagree
but
they
are
not
the
same
thing
what
i
do
mean
is
that
the
nipe
is
undoubtedly
the
most
superstitious
and
bigoted
being
on
the
face
of
this
planet
xiv
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
the
physical
therapist
put
his
head
in
sorry
to
interrupt
but
the
clam
is
done
i
give
him
a
rubdown
doc
and
you
can
have
him
back
excellent
would
you
come
up
to
my
office
bart
as
soon
as
you
had
your
mauling
sure
i
be
right
up
yoritomo
left
and
the
man
opened
the
steam
box
feel
bart
yeah
sure
he
said
abstractedly
as
he
got
up
on
the
rubdown
table
and
lay
prone
the
therapist
saw
that
stanton
was
in
no
mood
for
conversation
so
he
proceeded
with
the
massage
in
silence
for
the
first
time
stanton
was
seeing
the
nipe
as
an
individual
as
a
person
as
a
thinking
feeling
being
have
a
great
deal
in
common
you
and
i
he
thought
except
that
a
lot
worse
off
than
i
i
actually
feeling
sorry
for
the
poor
guy
stanton
thought
which
i
suppose
is
better
than
feeling
sorry
for
myself
the
only
difference
between
us
freaks
is
that
you
a
bigger
freak
than
i
am
molly
and
the
colonel
lady
are
sisters
under
the
skin
where
that
come
from
something
i
learned
in
school
i
guess
like
the
snarks
and
boojums
he
would
answer
to
hi
or
to
any
loud
cry
such
as
fry
me
or
fritter
my
wig
who
was
that
the
snark
no
this
memory
of
mine
or
can
i
even
call
it
mine
when
i
ca
even
use
it
for
now
we
see
through
a
glass
darkly
but
then
face
to
face
now
i
know
in
part
but
then
shall
i
know
even
as
also
i
am
known
another
thought
popping
up
from
nowhere
the
only
way
i
ever
get
all
this
stuff
straightened
out
is
to
get
more
information
and
it
does
look
as
though
anyone
is
going
to
give
it
to
me
on
a
platter
the
institute
seems
to
be
awfully
chary
about
giving
information
away
george
even
had
to
chase
away
old
here
that
feels
good
before
he
would
talk
about
the
nipe
ca
blame
for
that
i
guess
there
be
hell
to
pay
if
the
public
ever
found
out
that
the
nipe
has
been
kept
as
a
pet
for
six
years
how
many
people
has
he
killed
in
that
time
twenty
thirty
how
much
blood
does
colonel
mannheim
have
on
his
hands
though
they
know
not
why
or
for
what
they
give
still
the
few
must
die
that
the
many
may
live
i
wonder
whether
i
read
all
that
stuff
complete
or
just
browsed
through
a
copy
of
bartlett
quotations
fragments
we
got
to
get
organized
here
brother
colonel
mannheim
little
puppet
is
going
to
cut
his
strings
and
do
a
pinocchio
bart
the
said
giving
stanton
a
final
slap
you
all
set
see
you
tomorrow
right
gim
me
my
clothes
stanton
dressed
and
took
the
elevator
up
to
yoritomo
office
this
section
of
the
building
was
to
the
other
patients
in
the
institute
but
stanton
the
star
border
had
free
rein
not
that
it
mattered
one
way
or
another
there
was
any
way
they
could
have
stopped
him
aside
from
the
fact
that
he
was
physically
capable
of
going
through
or
around
almost
any
guards
they
wanted
to
put
up
there
was
also
the
little
matter
of
gentle
blackmail
when
a
man
is
genuinely
indispensable
he
can
work
wonders
by
threatening
to
drop
the
whole
business
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
slowly
awakening
from
a
long
sleep
at
first
he
had
accepted
as
natural
that
he
should
obey
orders
and
do
as
he
was
told
without
question
as
thought
he
had
been
drugged
or
hypnotized
it
very
likely
they
subjected
me
to
both
at
one
time
or
another
he
told
himself
but
now
his
brain
was
beginning
to
function
again
and
the
need
to
know
was
strong
in
his
mind
yoritomo
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
big
soft
chairs
puffing
at
his
pipe
but
he
leaped
to
his
feet
when
stanton
came
in
ah
about
the
culture
of
the
nipe
yes
sit
down
yes
so
do
you
find
it
impossible
that
a
high
technology
could
be
present
in
such
a
system
no
i
been
thinking
about
it
ah
so
he
sat
down
again
then
will
please
tell
well
let
see
in
the
first
place
let
take
religion
in
tribal
cultures
religion
is
uh
animistic
i
think
the
word
is
yoritomo
nodded
silently
there
are
spirits
everywhere
scanton
went
on
that
sort
of
belief
it
seems
to
me
would
grow
up
in
any
race
that
had
imagination
and
the
nipes
must
have
plenty
of
that
or
they
would
have
the
technology
they
do
have
very
good
good
but
what
evidence
have
you
that
this
technology
was
not
given
them
by
some
other
race
i
had
thought
of
that
stanton
stared
into
space
for
a
moment
then
nodded
his
head
of
course
it
would
take
too
long
for
another
race
to
teach
it
to
them
it
would
be
worth
the
trouble
unless
this
hypothetical
other
race
killed
off
all
the
adult
nipes
and
started
the
little
ones
off
fresh
and
if
that
had
happened
their
system
would
have
disappeared
too
that
argument
is
imperfect
yoritomo
said
but
it
will
do
for
the
moment
go
on
with
the
religion
religious
beliefs
are
not
subject
to
pragmatic
tests
that
is
the
spiritual
beliefs
are
any
belief
that
be
disproven
would
eventually
die
out
but
beliefs
in
ghosts
or
demons
or
angels
or
life
after
death
are
disprovable
so
as
a
race
increases
its
knowledge
of
the
physical
world
its
religion
tends
to
become
more
and
more
spiritual
agreed
yes
but
how
do
you
link
this
with
well
once
a
belief
gains
a
foothold
it
hard
to
wipe
it
out
even
among
humans
among
nipes
it
would
be
impossible
once
a
code
of
ritual
and
social
behavior
was
set
up
it
became
permanent
for
example
yoritomo
urged
well
shaking
hands
for
example
we
still
do
that
even
if
we
do
have
it
fixed
solidly
in
our
heads
that
we
do
it
i
suppose
it
would
never
occur
to
a
nipe
not
to
perform
such
a
ritual
just
so
yoritomo
agreed
vigorously
such
things
once
established
would
tend
to
remain
but
it
is
a
characteristic
of
a
system
that
it
resists
change
how
then
do
you
account
for
their
high
technological
achievements
the
pragmatic
engineering
approach
i
imagine
if
a
thing
works
it
is
usable
if
not
it
is
very
good
now
it
is
my
turn
to
lecture
he
put
his
pipe
in
an
ash
tray
and
held
up
a
long
bony
finger
firstly
we
must
remember
that
the
nipe
is
equipped
with
an
imagination
secondly
he
has
in
his
memory
a
tremendous
amount
of
data
all
ready
at
hand
he
is
capable
of
working
out
theories
in
his
head
you
see
like
the
ancient
greeks
he
finds
no
need
to
test
such
theories
his
thinking
indicates
that
such
an
experiment
would
yield
something
useful
unlike
the
greeks
he
has
no
aversion
to
experiment
but
he
sees
no
need
for
useless
experiment
either
oh
he
would
learn
yes
but
once
a
given
theory
proved
workable
how
resistant
he
would
be
to
a
new
theory
how
long
how
long
it
would
take
such
a
race
to
achieve
the
technology
the
nipe
now
has
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
said
stanton
yoritomo
shook
his
head
briskly
puh
longer
much
longer
he
smiled
with
satisfaction
i
estimate
that
the
nipe
race
first
invented
the
steam
engine
not
less
than
ten
million
years
ago
he
kept
smiling
into
the
dead
silence
that
followed
after
a
long
minute
scanton
said
what
about
atomic
energy
at
least
two
million
years
ago
i
do
not
think
they
have
had
the
interstellar
drive
more
than
fifty
thousand
years
no
wonder
our
pet
nipe
is
so
patient
stanton
said
wonderingly
i
wonder
what
their
individual
life
span
is
not
long
in
comparison
said
yoritomo
perhaps
no
longer
than
our
own
perhaps
five
hundred
years
considering
their
handicaps
they
have
done
quite
well
quite
well
indeed
for
a
race
of
illiterate
cannibals
how
that
again
stanton
realized
that
the
scientist
was
quite
serious
had
it
occurred
to
you
my
friend
that
they
must
be
cannibals
and
that
they
are
very
nearly
illiterate
no
stanton
admitted
it
had
the
nipe
like
man
is
omnivorous
specialization
tends
to
lead
any
race
up
a
blind
alley
and
dietary
restrictions
are
a
particularly
pernicious
form
of
specialization
a
lion
would
starve
to
death
in
a
wheat
field
a
horse
would
perish
in
a
butcher
shop
full
of
steaks
a
man
will
survive
as
long
as
there
something
around
to
eat
even
if
it
another
man
also
man
early
in
his
career
as
top
dog
on
earth
began
using
a
method
of
increasing
the
viability
of
the
race
by
removing
the
unfit
it
survives
today
in
some
societies
before
and
immediately
after
the
holocaust
there
were
still
primitive
societies
on
earth
which
made
a
rather
hard
ordeal
out
of
the
rite
of
passage
the
ceremony
that
enabled
a
boy
to
become
a
man
if
he
passed
the
tests
a
few
millennia
ago
a
boy
was
killed
outright
if
failed
and
eaten
the
nipe
race
must
of
necessity
have
had
some
similar
ritualistic
tests
or
they
would
not
have
become
what
they
are
and
we
have
already
agreed
that
once
the
nipes
adopted
something
of
that
kind
it
remained
with
them
not
so
yes
also
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
the
nipe
civilisation
if
such
it
can
be
called
has
any
geriatric
problem
no
old
age
pensions
no
old
homes
no
senility
when
a
nipe
becomes
a
burden
because
of
age
he
is
ritually
murdered
and
eaten
with
due
solemnity
ah
you
frown
my
friend
have
i
made
them
sound
heartless
without
the
finer
feelings
that
we
humans
are
so
proud
of
not
so
when
junior
nipe
fails
his
puberty
tests
when
mama
and
papa
nipe
are
sent
to
their
final
reward
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is
sadness
in
the
hearts
of
their
loved
ones
as
the
honored
are
passed
around
the
table
my
own
ancestors
not
too
far
back
performed
a
ritual
suicide
by
disemboweling
themselves
with
a
sharp
knife
across
the
abdomen
so
and
up
into
the
heart
so
it
was
considered
very
bad
form
to
die
or
faint
before
the
job
was
done
nearby
a
relative
or
close
friend
stood
with
a
sharp
sword
to
administer
the
de
by
decapitation
it
was
all
very
sad
and
very
honorable
their
loved
ones
bore
the
sorrow
with
pride
his
voice
which
had
been
low
and
tender
suddenly
became
very
brisk
thank
goodness
it
gone
out
of
fashion
but
how
can
you
be
they
cannibals
stanton
asked
your
argument
sounds
logical
enough
but
logic
alone
is
enough
true
true
yoritomo
jabbed
the
air
twice
with
his
finger
evidence
would
be
most
welcome
would
it
not
very
well
i
give
you
the
evidence
he
eats
human
beings
our
nipe
that
does
make
him
a
cannibal
not
perhaps
but
consider
the
nipe
is
not
a
monster
he
is
not
a
criminal
no
he
is
a
gentleman
he
behaves
as
a
gentleman
he
is
shipwrecked
on
an
alien
planet
around
his
he
sees
evidence
that
ours
is
a
technological
society
but
that
is
a
contradiction
a
paradox
for
are
not
civilized
no
we
are
not
rational
we
are
not
sane
we
do
not
obey
the
laws
we
do
not
perform
the
rituals
we
are
animals
apparently
intelligent
animals
but
animals
never
the
less
how
can
this
be
ha
says
the
nipe
to
himself
these
animals
must
be
ruled
over
by
real
people
it
is
the
only
explanation
not
so
colonel
mannheim
mentioned
that
are
you
implying
that
the
nipe
thinks
that
there
are
other
nipes
around
running
the
world
from
secret
hideouts
like
the
fu
manchu
novel
illustration
not
quite
the
nipe
is
not
incapable
of
learning
something
new
in
fact
he
is
quite
good
at
it
as
witness
the
fact
that
he
has
learned
many
earth
languages
he
picked
up
russian
in
less
then
eight
months
simply
by
listening
and
observing
like
our
own
race
his
undoubtedly
evolved
many
languages
during
the
beginnings
of
its
progress
when
there
were
many
tribes
separated
and
out
of
communication
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
find
that
most
of
those
languages
have
survived
and
that
our
distressed
astronaut
knows
them
all
a
new
language
would
not
distress
him
nor
would
intelligent
beings
distress
him
his
race
should
be
aware
by
now
that
such
things
exist
but
it
is
very
likely
that
he
equates
intelligence
with
technology
and
i
do
not
think
he
has
ever
met
a
race
higher
than
the
barbarian
level
before
such
races
were
not
of
course
human
by
his
definition
they
showed
possibilities
perhaps
but
they
had
not
evolved
far
enough
considering
the
time
span
involved
it
is
not
at
all
unlikely
that
the
nipe
thinks
of
technology
as
something
that
evolves
with
a
race
in
the
same
way
intelligence
does
or
the
body
itself
so
it
would
not
surprise
him
to
find
that
the
real
people
of
this
system
were
humanoid
in
shape
that
is
something
new
and
he
can
absorb
it
it
does
not
contradict
anything
he
any
truly
intelligent
being
which
did
not
obey
the
law
and
follow
the
ritual
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
for
he
has
no
notion
of
a
real
person
without
those
characteristics
without
those
characteristics
technology
is
impossible
since
he
sees
technology
all
around
him
it
follows
that
there
must
be
real
people
with
those
characteristics
anything
else
is
unthinkable
it
seems
to
me
that
you
building
an
awfully
involved
theory
out
of
pretty
flimsy
stuff
stanton
said
yoritomo
shook
his
head
not
at
all
all
evidence
points
to
it
why
do
you
suppose
does
the
nipe
conscientiously
devour
his
victims
often
risking
his
own
safety
to
do
so
why
do
you
suppose
he
never
uses
any
weapons
but
his
own
hands
to
kill
with
why
to
tell
the
real
people
that
he
is
a
gentleman
it
made
perfect
sense
stanton
thought
it
fitted
every
known
fact
as
far
as
he
knew
still
i
would
think
he
said
that
the
nipe
would
have
realized
after
ten
years
that
there
is
no
such
race
of
real
people
he
had
access
to
all
our
records
and
such
things
or
does
he
reject
them
as
lies
possibly
he
would
if
he
could
read
them
did
i
not
say
he
was
illiterate
you
mean
he
learned
to
speak
our
languages
but
not
to
read
them
the
scientist
smiled
broadly
your
statement
is
accurate
my
friend
but
incomplete
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
nipe
is
incapable
of
reading
any
written
language
whatever
the
concept
does
not
exist
in
his
mind
except
vaguely
a
technological
race
without
a
written
language
that
impossible
ah
no
ask
yourself
what
need
has
a
race
with
a
perfect
memory
for
written
records
at
least
in
the
sense
we
know
them
certainly
not
to
remember
things
all
their
history
and
all
their
technology
exists
in
the
collective
mind
of
the
race
or
at
least
most
of
it
i
dare
say
that
the
less
important
parts
of
their
history
has
been
glossed
over
and
forgotten
one
important
event
in
every
ten
centuries
would
still
give
a
historian
ten
thousand
events
to
remember
and
history
is
only
a
late
development
in
our
own
society
how
about
communications
stanton
said
what
did
they
use
before
they
invented
radio
ah
that
is
why
i
hedged
when
i
said
he
was
illiterate
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
written
symbology
did
at
one
time
exist
for
just
that
purpose
if
so
it
has
probably
survived
as
a
ritualistic
form
when
an
officer
is
appointed
to
a
post
let
say
he
may
get
a
formal
paper
that
says
so
they
may
use
symbols
to
signify
rank
and
so
on
they
certainly
must
have
a
symbology
for
the
calibration
of
scientific
instruments
but
none
of
these
requires
the
complexity
of
a
written
language
i
dare
say
our
use
of
it
is
quite
baffling
to
him
and
if
he
thinks
of
symbols
as
being
unable
to
convey
much
information
then
he
might
not
be
able
to
learn
to
read
at
all
you
see
where
your
evidence
for
that
it
is
sketchy
i
will
admit
said
yoritomo
it
is
not
as
solidly
based
as
our
other
reconstructions
of
his
background
the
pattern
of
his
raids
indicates
however
that
his
knowledge
of
the
materials
he
wants
and
their
locations
comes
from
vocal
sources
television
advertising
and
so
on
in
other
words
he
cases
the
joint
by
ear
if
he
could
understand
written
information
his
job
would
have
been
much
easier
he
could
have
found
the
materials
more
quickly
and
easily
from
this
evidence
we
are
fairly
certain
that
he
ca
read
any
terrestrial
writing
add
to
that
the
fact
that
he
has
never
been
observed
writing
down
anything
himself
and
the
suspicion
dawns
that
perhaps
he
that
symbols
can
only
convey
a
very
small
amount
of
specialized
information
eh
as
i
said
it
is
not
proof
no
but
the
whole
thing
makes
for
some
very
interesting
speculation
does
it
very
interesting
indeed
yoritomo
folded
his
hands
in
his
lap
smiled
seraphically
and
looked
at
the
ceiling
in
fact
my
friend
we
are
now
so
positive
of
our
knowledge
of
the
nipe
mind
that
we
are
prepared
to
enter
into
the
next
phase
of
our
program
within
a
very
short
while
if
we
are
correct
we
shall
with
your
help
arrest
the
most
feared
that
earth
has
ever
known
he
chuckled
but
there
was
little
mirth
in
it
i
dare
say
that
the
public
will
be
extremely
happy
to
hear
of
his
death
and
i
know
that
colonel
mannheim
and
the
rest
of
us
will
be
glad
to
know
that
he
will
never
kill
again
stanton
saw
that
the
fateful
day
was
looming
suddenly
large
in
the
future
how
soon
within
days
he
lowered
his
eyes
from
the
ceiling
and
looked
into
stanton
face
with
a
mildly
bland
expression
by
the
way
he
said
did
you
know
that
your
brother
is
returning
to
earth
tomorrow
xv
interlude
is
this
our
young
man
dr
farnsworth
asked
the
man
in
uniform
yes
it
is
colonel
mannheim
i
like
you
to
meet
bartholomew
stanton
how
are
you
mr
stanton
fine
colonel
a
little
nervous
the
colonel
chuckled
softly
i
ca
say
that
i
blame
you
it
not
an
easy
decision
to
make
he
looked
at
farnsworth
has
yoritomo
any
more
information
for
us
farnsworth
shook
his
head
no
he
admits
that
his
idea
is
nothing
more
than
a
wild
hunch
he
seems
to
think
that
five
years
of
observing
the
nipe
wo
be
too
much
time
at
all
we
may
have
to
act
before
then
i
hope
not
it
would
be
a
terrible
waste
said
mannheim
stanton
i
know
that
farnsworth
has
outlined
the
entire
plan
to
you
and
i
sure
you
aware
that
many
things
can
change
in
five
years
we
may
have
to
play
by
ear
long
before
that
do
you
understand
what
we
are
doing
and
why
it
must
be
done
this
way
yes
sir
you
know
that
you
not
to
say
anything
yes
sir
do
worry
i
can
keep
my
mouth
shut
we
pretty
sure
of
that
the
colonel
said
with
a
smile
your
psychometric
tests
showed
that
we
were
right
in
picking
you
otherwise
we
could
have
told
you
you
understand
your
part
in
this
eh
yes
sir
any
questions
yes
sir
what
about
my
brother
martin
i
mean
well
i
know
what
the
matter
with
him
aside
from
the
radiation
i
mean
do
you
think
he
be
able
to
handle
his
part
of
the
job
after
after
the
operations
if
the
operations
turn
out
as
well
as
farnsworth
thinks
they
will
yes
and
with
the
therapy
we
give
him
afterwards
he
be
in
fine
shape
well
he
looked
thoughtful
five
more
years
and
then
i
have
the
twin
brother
that
i
never
really
had
at
all
somehow
it
does
really
register
i
guess
do
worry
about
it
stanton
said
farnsworth
we
got
a
complex
enough
job
ahead
of
us
without
your
worrying
in
the
bargain
by
the
way
we
need
your
signature
here
he
handed
him
a
pen
and
spread
the
paper
on
the
desk
in
triplicate
the
young
man
read
quickly
through
the
release
form
all
nice
and
legal
huh
well
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
bent
over
and
wrote
in
a
firm
clear
hand
xvi
the
tunnel
was
long
and
black
and
the
air
was
stale
and
thick
with
the
stench
of
rodents
stanton
stood
still
trying
to
probe
the
luminescent
gloom
that
the
goggles
he
wore
brought
to
his
eyes
the
tunnel
stretched
out
before
him
on
and
on
around
him
was
the
smell
of
viciousness
and
death
ahead
goes
on
to
stanton
thought
at
last
at
barbell
said
a
voice
near
his
ear
barhop
here
do
you
read
it
was
the
barest
whisper
picked
up
by
the
antennae
in
his
shoes
from
the
steel
rail
that
ran
along
the
tunnel
read
you
barhop
move
out
then
you
got
a
long
stroll
to
go
stanton
started
walking
keeping
his
feet
near
the
rail
in
case
barhop
wanted
to
call
again
as
he
walked
he
could
feel
the
slight
motion
of
the
woven
elastic
suit
that
he
wore
rubbing
against
his
skin
and
he
could
hear
the
scratching
patter
of
the
rats
mostly
they
stayed
away
from
him
but
he
could
see
them
hiding
in
corners
and
scurrying
along
the
sides
of
the
tunnel
around
him
six
robots
moved
with
him
shifting
their
pattern
constantly
as
they
patrolled
his
moving
figure
far
ahead
he
knew
other
rat
robots
were
stationed
watching
and
waiting
ready
to
deactivate
the
nipe
detection
devices
at
just
the
right
moment
behind
him
another
horde
moved
forward
to
turn
the
devices
on
again
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
learn
how
to
shut
off
those
detectors
without
giving
the
alarm
to
the
nipe
instruments
there
were
nearly
a
hundred
men
in
on
the
operation
operating
the
robot
rats
or
watching
the
hidden
cameras
that
spied
upon
the
nipe
nearly
a
hundred
and
all
of
them
were
safe
they
were
outside
the
tunnel
they
were
with
stanton
only
in
proxy
they
could
not
die
here
in
this
stinking
hole
but
stanton
could
there
was
no
help
for
it
stanton
had
to
go
in
person
a
robot
proxy
would
be
stronger
although
not
faster
unless
stanton
controlled
it
than
the
nipe
but
the
nipe
would
be
able
to
tell
that
it
was
a
robot
and
he
would
simply
destroy
it
with
one
of
his
weapons
a
robot
would
never
get
close
enough
to
the
nipe
to
do
any
good
we
do
not
know
yoritomo
had
said
whether
he
would
recognize
it
as
a
robot
or
not
but
his
instruments
would
show
the
metal
easily
enough
and
his
eyes
might
be
able
to
see
that
it
was
not
covered
with
human
skin
the
rats
are
covered
with
real
rat
hides
they
are
small
and
he
is
used
to
seeing
them
around
but
a
robot
ah
no
never
so
stanton
had
to
go
in
in
person
walking
southward
along
the
miles
of
blackness
that
led
to
the
nest
of
the
nipe
overhead
was
government
city
he
had
walked
those
streets
only
the
night
before
and
he
knew
that
only
a
short
distance
above
him
was
an
entirely
different
world
somewhere
up
there
his
brother
was
waiting
after
having
run
the
gamut
of
televised
interviews
dinner
at
one
of
the
best
restaurants
and
a
party
afterward
a
celebrity
the
greatest
detective
in
the
solar
system
they
called
him
fine
stuff
that
stanton
wondered
what
the
asteroids
were
like
maybe
that
would
be
the
place
to
go
after
this
job
was
done
maybe
they
have
a
place
in
the
asteroids
for
a
superman
or
maybe
there
only
be
a
place
here
beneath
the
streets
of
government
city
for
a
dead
superman
if
i
can
help
it
stanton
thought
with
a
grim
smile
the
walking
seemed
to
take
forever
but
somehow
stanton
did
mind
it
he
had
a
lot
to
think
over
seeing
his
brother
had
been
unnerving
yesterday
but
today
he
felt
as
though
everything
had
been
all
right
all
along
his
memory
still
was
a
long
way
from
being
complete
and
it
probably
always
would
be
he
could
still
scarcely
recall
any
real
memories
of
a
boy
named
martin
stanton
but
and
he
smiled
at
the
thought
he
knew
more
about
him
than
his
brother
did
at
that
it
did
matter
that
martin
stanton
was
gone
in
effect
he
had
been
demolished
what
little
there
had
been
of
him
and
a
new
structure
had
been
built
on
the
old
foundation
and
yet
in
another
way
the
new
structure
was
very
like
what
would
have
developed
naturally
if
the
accident
so
early
in
life
had
not
occurred
stanton
skirted
a
pile
of
rubble
on
his
right
there
had
been
a
station
here
once
the
street
above
had
caved
in
and
filled
in
with
brick
concrete
cobblestones
and
steel
scrap
and
then
it
had
been
sealed
over
when
government
city
was
built
a
part
of
one
wall
was
still
unbroken
though
a
sign
built
of
tile
said
he
knew
although
it
was
visible
in
the
dim
glow
he
kept
walking
ignoring
the
rats
that
scampered
over
the
rubble
barhop
to
barbell
said
the
soft
voice
near
his
ear
no
sign
of
activity
from
the
nipe
so
far
you
have
triggered
any
of
his
alarms
barbell
to
barhop
stanton
whispered
what
he
doing
still
sitting
motionless
thinking
i
guess
or
sleeping
it
hard
to
tell
let
me
know
if
he
starts
moving
around
will
do
unsuspecting
beastie
stanton
thought
years
of
hard
work
ten
years
of
feeling
secure
and
within
a
very
short
time
he
going
to
get
the
shock
of
his
or
maybe
not
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
what
kind
of
shocks
the
nipe
had
taken
in
his
life
stanton
thought
not
even
of
knowing
whether
the
nipe
was
capable
of
feeling
anything
like
security
it
was
odd
he
thought
that
he
should
feel
a
kinship
toward
both
the
nipe
and
his
brother
in
such
similar
ways
he
had
never
met
the
nipe
and
his
brother
was
a
dim
picture
in
his
old
memories
but
they
were
both
very
well
known
to
him
certainly
better
known
to
him
than
he
was
to
them
and
yet
seeing
his
brother
face
on
the
tv
screen
hearing
him
talk
watching
the
way
he
moved
about
watching
the
expressions
on
his
face
had
been
a
tremendously
moving
thing
not
until
that
moment
had
he
really
known
himself
meeting
him
face
to
face
would
be
easier
now
but
it
would
still
be
a
scene
highly
charged
with
emotional
tension
he
kicked
something
that
rattled
and
rolled
away
from
him
he
stopped
freezing
in
his
tracks
trying
to
pierce
the
dully
glowing
gloom
it
was
a
human
skull
he
relaxed
and
began
walking
again
illustration
there
were
plenty
of
bones
down
here
mannheim
had
said
that
the
tunnels
had
been
used
as
shelters
when
the
sun
bomb
had
hit
the
island
during
the
holocaust
thousands
had
crowded
underground
after
the
warning
had
come
and
they
had
died
when
the
bright
hot
deadly
gas
had
roared
down
through
ventilators
and
open
stairwells
there
were
even
caches
of
canned
goods
down
here
some
of
them
still
sealed
after
all
this
time
but
the
rats
wiser
than
they
knew
had
chewed
at
them
exposing
the
steel
beneath
the
tin
plate
after
a
while
oxidation
would
weaken
a
can
to
the
point
where
some
lucky
rat
could
bite
through
it
and
find
himself
a
meal
then
he
could
move
the
empty
can
aside
and
gnaw
the
next
one
in
the
pile
and
the
cycle
would
begin
again
it
kept
the
rats
fed
almost
as
well
as
an
automatic
machine
might
have
the
tunnel
was
an
endless
monochromatic
world
that
was
both
artificial
and
natural
here
there
was
a
neatly
mosaic
of
ceramic
tile
over
there
on
a
little
hillock
of
earth
squatted
a
colony
of
fat
mushrooms
in
one
place
he
had
to
skirt
a
pool
of
water
in
another
climb
over
a
heap
of
rust
and
debris
that
had
once
been
a
subway
car
one
man
alone
walking
through
the
dark
towards
a
superhuman
monster
that
had
terrorized
earth
for
a
decade
a
drug
that
would
knock
out
the
nipe
would
have
been
useful
but
that
would
have
required
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
nipe
biochemistry
than
anyone
had
the
same
applied
to
anesthetic
gases
or
electric
shock
or
supersonics
the
only
answer
was
a
man
called
stanton
and
the
voice
near
his
ear
said
a
hundred
yards
to
go
barbell
i
know
he
whispered
he
has
moved
no
it
be
funny
if
he
were
dead
stanton
thought
his
heart
had
stopped
or
something
would
that
be
a
big
joke
on
everybody
especially
ahead
the
tunnel
made
a
curving
turn
and
there
was
a
large
area
that
had
once
been
a
major
junction
of
two
tunnels
one
below
the
other
the
nipe
had
taken
over
a
part
of
that
area
to
build
his
stanton
approached
the
turn
and
took
off
the
goggles
enough
light
spilled
over
from
the
nipe
lair
to
illuminate
the
tunnel
he
put
the
goggles
on
the
trackway
he
would
need
them
again
he
went
on
around
the
curve
slowly
and
quietly
he
did
want
to
fight
down
here
in
the
tracks
and
he
did
want
to
be
caught
just
yet
cautiously
he
lifted
himself
up
to
the
platform
where
passengers
had
once
waited
for
trains
now
that
he
was
out
of
the
trench
that
the
tracks
lay
in
he
could
move
more
easily
he
moved
away
from
the
tracks
barbell
he
heard
you
watch
it
but
stanton
had
already
heard
the
movement
of
the
nipe
he
jerked
off
the
communicator
and
threw
it
away
he
did
want
any
encumbrances
now
and
then
as
fast
as
any
express
train
that
had
ever
moved
in
these
underground
ways
the
nipe
came
around
a
corner
thirty
feet
away
his
four
violet
eyes
gleaming
his
limbs
rippling
beneath
his
body
fifteen
feet
away
he
launched
himself
through
the
air
his
outstretched
hands
ready
to
but
stanton
marvelous
system
was
already
in
action
at
this
stage
of
the
game
it
would
be
suicide
to
let
the
nipe
get
close
he
could
fend
off
eight
grasping
hands
with
his
own
two
he
leaped
to
one
side
and
the
nipe
got
his
first
surprise
in
ten
years
when
fist
slammed
against
the
side
of
his
snouted
head
knocking
him
in
the
opposite
direction
from
that
in
which
stanton
had
moved
the
nipe
landed
turned
and
charged
back
toward
the
man
this
time
he
reared
up
using
his
two
rear
pairs
of
limbs
for
locomotion
while
the
two
forward
pair
were
held
out
ready
to
kill
he
got
surprise
number
two
when
stanton
fist
landed
on
his
snout
rocking
his
head
back
his
own
hands
met
nothing
but
air
and
by
the
time
he
had
recovered
from
the
blow
stanton
was
well
back
out
of
the
way
so
small
stanton
thought
wonderingly
even
when
he
reared
up
the
nipe
head
was
only
three
feet
above
the
concrete
floor
the
nipe
came
in
again
more
cautiously
this
time
stanton
punched
again
with
a
straight
right
the
nipe
moved
his
head
aside
and
stanton
knuckles
merely
grazed
the
side
of
his
head
below
the
lower
right
eye
one
of
the
nipe
hands
came
in
in
a
chopping
right
hook
that
took
stanton
just
below
the
ribs
stanton
leaped
back
with
a
gasp
of
pain
the
nipe
did
use
fists
he
used
his
open
hand
fingers
together
like
a
judo
fighter
the
nipe
came
forward
once
more
and
as
stanton
danced
back
the
nipe
made
a
grab
for
his
ankle
almost
catching
it
there
were
too
many
hands
to
watch
stanton
had
two
advantages
weight
and
reach
his
arms
were
almost
half
again
as
long
as
the
nipe
against
that
the
nipe
had
all
those
hands
and
with
his
low
center
of
gravity
and
stance
it
would
be
hard
to
knock
him
down
if
stanton
lost
his
footing
the
fight
would
be
over
fast
stanton
lunged
suddenly
forward
and
planted
a
left
in
the
nipe
right
upper
eye
then
followed
it
with
a
right
uppercut
to
the
nipe
jaw
as
his
head
snapped
back
the
nipe
four
hands
cut
inward
from
the
sides
like
sword
blades
but
they
found
no
target
backing
away
stanton
suddenly
realized
that
he
had
another
advantage
the
nipe
could
throw
a
straight
jab
his
shoulder
if
that
what
they
should
be
called
were
narrow
and
the
upper
armbones
were
articulated
properly
for
such
a
blow
he
could
throw
a
mean
hook
but
he
had
to
get
in
close
to
deliver
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
was
the
fact
that
the
nipe
knew
plenty
about
human
anatomy
from
the
bones
out
stanton
knowledge
of
nipe
anatomy
was
almost
totally
superficial
he
wished
he
knew
if
and
where
the
nipe
had
a
solar
plexus
he
would
like
to
punch
something
soft
for
a
change
instead
he
tried
for
another
eye
he
danced
in
jabbed
and
danced
out
again
the
nipe
had
ducked
again
taking
it
on
the
side
of
his
head
then
the
nipe
came
in
low
at
an
angle
trying
for
the
groin
for
his
troubles
he
got
a
knee
in
the
jaw
that
staggered
him
badly
one
grasping
hand
clutched
at
stanton
right
thigh
and
grasped
hard
stanton
swung
his
fist
down
like
a
pendulum
and
knocked
the
arm
aside
but
there
was
a
slight
limp
in
his
movement
as
he
away
from
the
nipe
that
pinch
had
hurt
stanton
was
angry
now
with
the
hot
controlled
anger
of
a
fighting
man
he
stepped
in
and
slammed
two
fast
hard
jabs
into
the
point
of
the
nipe
snout
jarring
the
monster
backwards
this
time
it
was
the
nipe
who
scuttled
backwards
stanton
moved
in
to
press
his
advantage
and
landed
a
beaut
on
the
lower
left
eye
then
he
tried
a
body
blow
it
was
too
successful
the
alien
had
an
endoskeleton
but
he
also
had
a
hide
that
was
like
somewhat
leathery
chitin
he
pulled
back
out
of
the
way
of
the
nipe
judo
cuts
his
fists
were
beginning
to
hurt
and
his
leg
was
paining
him
badly
where
the
nipe
had
clamped
on
to
it
and
his
ribs
and
then
he
realized
that
so
far
the
nipe
had
only
landed
one
blow
punch
and
one
pinch
he
thought
with
a
touch
of
awe
only
other
damage
he
inflicted
has
been
to
my
knuckles
the
nipe
charged
in
again
then
he
leaped
suddenly
and
clawed
for
stanton
face
with
his
first
pair
of
hands
the
second
and
third
pairs
chopped
in
toward
the
man
body
the
last
pair
propelled
him
off
the
floor
stanton
stepped
back
and
let
him
have
a
right
just
below
the
jaw
where
his
throat
would
have
been
if
he
been
human
the
nipe
arced
backwards
in
a
and
landed
flat
on
his
back
stanton
backed
up
a
little
more
waiting
while
the
nipe
wriggled
feebly
for
a
moment
marquis
of
queensbury
should
have
lived
to
see
this
he
thought
the
nipe
rolled
over
and
crouched
on
all
eight
limbs
his
violet
eyes
watched
stanton
but
the
man
could
read
no
expression
on
that
inhuman
face
did
not
for
a
moment
stanton
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
hissing
guttural
voice
had
come
from
the
crouching
monster
did
not
try
i
have
no
wish
to
kill
you
stanton
said
evenly
can
see
that
do
you
are
you
he
stopped
as
if
baffled
are
not
the
proper
words
do
you
follow
the
customs
stanton
felt
a
surge
of
triumph
this
was
what
george
yoritomo
had
guessed
might
happen
if
i
must
kill
you
he
said
carefully
i
myself
will
do
the
honors
you
will
not
go
uneaten
the
nipe
sagged
a
little
relaxing
all
over
had
hoped
it
was
so
it
was
the
only
thinkable
thing
i
saw
you
on
the
television
and
it
was
only
thinkable
that
you
came
for
stanton
blinked
stunned
what
was
the
nipe
thinking
but
of
course
he
knew
and
he
saw
that
even
his
brother
return
had
been
a
part
of
the
plan
knew
you
were
out
in
the
asteroids
the
nipe
went
on
i
had
decided
you
had
come
to
kill
since
you
did
not
what
are
your
thoughts
stanley
martin
that
we
should
help
each
other
stanton
said
it
was
as
simple
as
that
xvii
stanton
sat
in
his
hotel
room
smoking
a
cigarette
staring
at
the
wall
and
thinking
he
was
alone
again
all
the
fuss
feathers
and
fooferaw
were
over
farnsworth
was
in
another
room
of
the
suite
making
his
plans
for
a
complete
physical
examination
of
the
nipe
yoritomo
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
holding
a
conversation
with
the
nipe
drawing
the
alien
out
and
getting
him
to
talk
about
his
own
race
and
their
history
and
mannheim
was
plotting
the
next
phase
of
the
capture
the
stanton
smiled
a
little
colonel
mannheim
was
a
great
one
for
planning
all
right
every
little
detail
was
taken
care
of
it
sometimes
made
his
plans
more
complex
than
necessary
stanton
suspected
mannheim
tended
to
try
to
account
for
every
eventuality
and
after
he
had
done
that
he
would
set
aside
reserves
here
and
there
just
in
case
they
might
be
useful
if
something
unforeseen
happened
stanton
got
up
walked
over
to
the
window
and
looked
down
at
the
streets
of
government
city
eight
floors
below
all
things
considered
the
government
had
done
the
right
thing
and
in
picking
mannheim
they
had
picked
the
right
man
what
would
the
average
citizen
think
if
he
knew
the
true
story
of
the
nipe
if
he
discovered
that
at
this
very
moment
the
nipe
was
being
treated
almost
as
an
honored
guest
of
the
government
if
he
suspected
that
the
nipe
could
have
been
killed
easily
at
any
time
during
the
past
six
years
would
it
be
possible
to
explain
that
in
the
long
run
the
knowledge
possessed
by
the
nipe
was
tremendously
more
valuable
to
the
race
of
man
that
the
lives
of
a
few
individuals
could
those
people
down
there
and
the
others
like
them
all
over
the
world
be
made
to
understand
that
by
his
own
lights
the
nipe
had
been
acting
in
a
most
civilized
and
gentlemanly
way
he
knew
would
they
see
that
because
of
the
priceless
information
stored
in
that
alien
brain
the
nipe
life
had
to
be
preserved
at
any
cost
yoritomo
assumed
that
mannheim
would
spread
a
story
about
the
death
perhaps
even
display
a
corpse
but
stanton
had
the
feeling
that
the
colonel
had
something
else
up
his
sleeve
the
phone
rang
stanton
walked
over
thumbed
the
answer
stud
and
watched
farnsworth
face
take
shape
on
the
screen
bart
i
just
saw
the
tapes
of
your
fight
with
the
nipe
incredible
going
to
have
them
run
over
again
slowed
down
so
that
i
can
see
what
went
on
and
i
like
to
have
you
tell
as
best
you
can
what
went
on
in
your
mind
at
each
stage
of
the
fight
you
mean
right
now
i
have
an
appointment
farnsworth
waved
a
hand
no
no
later
take
your
time
but
i
am
honestly
amazed
that
you
won
so
easily
i
knew
you
were
good
and
i
knew
you
win
but
i
honestly
expected
you
to
be
injured
stanton
looked
down
at
his
bandaged
hands
and
felt
the
ache
of
his
broken
rib
and
the
blue
bruise
on
his
thigh
in
spite
of
the
way
it
looked
he
had
actually
been
hurt
worse
than
the
nipe
had
that
boy
was
the
trouble
was
that
he
could
adapt
himself
to
fighting
in
a
new
way
he
told
farnsworth
he
fought
me
as
he
would
have
fought
another
nipe
and
that
did
work
i
had
the
reach
on
him
and
i
could
maneuver
faster
it
looked
to
me
as
though
you
were
fighting
him
as
you
would
fight
another
human
being
farnsworth
said
stanton
grinned
i
was
in
a
modified
way
but
won
the
nipe
did
farnsworth
grinned
back
i
see
well
i
let
you
know
when
i
ready
for
your
impressions
probably
tomorrow
some
time
fine
he
walked
back
over
to
the
window
but
this
time
he
looked
at
the
horizon
not
at
the
street
farnsworth
had
called
him
bart
it
funny
stanton
thought
how
habit
can
get
the
best
of
a
man
farnsworth
had
known
the
truth
all
along
and
now
he
knew
that
his
patient
patient
was
aware
of
the
truth
and
still
he
had
called
him
bart
i
still
think
of
myself
as
bart
he
thought
probably
always
and
why
not
martin
stanton
no
longer
existed
in
fact
he
had
never
had
much
of
a
real
existence
he
was
only
a
bad
dream
only
bart
was
real
take
two
people
genetically
identical
damage
one
of
them
so
badly
that
he
is
helpless
and
useless
and
always
only
a
step
away
from
death
it
is
inevitable
that
the
weaker
will
identify
himself
with
the
stronger
the
vague
telepathic
bond
that
always
links
identical
twins
they
think
alike
they
say
becomes
unbalanced
under
such
conditions
normally
there
is
a
and
each
preserves
the
sense
of
his
own
identity
since
the
two
different
sets
of
sense
receptors
give
different
viewpoints
but
if
one
of
the
twins
is
damaged
badly
enough
something
must
happen
to
the
telepathic
link
usually
it
is
broken
but
the
link
between
mart
and
bart
stanton
had
not
been
broken
it
had
become
a
channel
martin
in
order
to
escape
the
prison
of
his
own
body
had
become
a
receptor
for
bart
thoughts
he
felt
as
bart
felt
the
thrill
of
running
after
a
baseball
the
pride
of
doing
something
clever
with
his
hands
in
effect
martin
ceased
to
think
the
thoughts
in
his
mind
were
bart
the
feeling
of
identity
was
almost
complete
to
an
outside
observer
it
appeared
that
martin
had
become
a
cataleptic
schizophrenic
completely
cut
off
from
reality
the
bart
part
of
him
did
not
want
to
be
disturbed
by
the
sensory
impressions
that
mart
body
provided
like
the
schizophrenic
martin
was
living
in
a
little
world
that
was
cut
off
from
the
actual
physical
world
around
his
body
the
difference
between
martin
condition
and
that
of
the
ordinary
schizophrenic
was
that
little
world
actually
existed
it
was
an
almost
exact
counterpart
of
the
world
that
existed
in
the
perfectly
sane
rational
mind
of
his
brother
bart
it
grew
and
developed
as
bart
did
fed
by
the
telepathic
flow
from
the
stronger
mind
to
the
weaker
there
were
two
barts
and
no
mart
at
all
and
then
the
neurophysical
institute
had
come
into
the
picture
a
new
process
had
been
developed
by
which
a
human
being
could
be
reconstructed
made
literally
into
a
superman
the
drawback
was
that
a
normal
human
body
resisted
the
process
to
the
death
if
necessary
just
as
a
normal
human
body
will
resist
a
skin
graft
from
an
alien
donor
but
the
body
of
martin
stanton
had
no
resistance
of
that
kind
with
him
perhaps
the
process
might
work
so
bartholomew
stanton
martin
legal
guardian
after
the
death
of
their
mother
had
given
permission
for
the
series
of
operations
that
would
rebuild
his
brother
the
telepathic
link
of
course
had
to
be
shut
off
for
a
time
at
least
part
of
that
could
be
done
in
the
treatment
of
martin
but
bart
too
had
to
do
his
part
by
submitting
to
hypnosis
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
convinced
that
his
name
was
stanley
martin
he
had
taken
a
job
on
luna
and
then
had
gone
to
the
asteriods
the
simple
change
of
name
and
environment
had
been
just
enough
to
snap
the
link
during
a
time
when
martin
brain
had
been
inactivated
by
therapy
and
anesthetics
only
the
sense
of
identity
remained
the
patient
was
still
bart
mannheim
had
used
them
both
naturally
colonel
mannheim
had
the
ability
to
use
anyone
at
hand
including
himself
to
get
a
job
done
stanton
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
time
mannheim
had
sent
for
stanley
martin
when
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
return
in
order
to
give
the
nipe
data
that
he
would
be
sure
to
misinterpret
a
special
code
phrase
in
the
message
had
released
stanley
martin
from
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
that
had
held
him
for
so
long
he
knew
that
he
was
bartholomew
stanton
again
so
do
i
thought
the
man
by
the
window
have
a
lot
to
straighten
out
we
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
stanton
walked
over
and
opened
it
trying
to
think
it
was
like
looking
into
a
mirror
hello
bart
he
said
hello
bart
said
the
other
in
that
instant
the
complete
telepathic
linkage
was
restored
and
they
both
knew
what
only
one
of
them
had
known
before
that
for
a
time
the
flow
had
been
again
that
stanley
martin
had
experienced
the
entire
battle
with
the
nipe
his
release
from
the
posthypnotic
suggestion
had
made
it
possible
duobus
there
was
unity
without
loss
of
identity
