this

so
foreign
and
eight
more
published
by

press
in
september
isbn
released
this
story
along
with
five
others
under
the
terms
of
a
creative
commons
license
that
gives
you
the
reader
a
bunch
of
rights
that
copyright
normally
reserves
for
me
the
creator
i
recently
did
the
same
thing
with
the
entire
text
of
my
novel
down
and
out
in
the
magic
kingdom
http
and
it
was
an
unmitigated
success
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
downloaded
the
book
good
news
and
thousands
of
people
bought
the
book
also
good
news
it
turns
out
that
as
near
as
anyone
can
tell
distributing
free
electronic
versions
of
books
is
a
great
way
to
sell
more
of
the
paper
editions
while
simultaneously
getting
the
book
into
the
hands
of
readers
who
would
otherwise
not
be
exposed
to
my
work
i
still
do
know
how
it
is
artists
will
earn
a
living
in
the
age
of
the
internet
but
i
remain
convinced
that
the
way
to
find
out
is
to
do
basic
science
that
is
to
do
stuff
and
observe
the
outcome
that
what
i
doing
here
the
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
very
thing
you
can
do
to
me
as
an
artist
is
to
not
read
my
work
to
let
it
languish
in
obscurity
and
disappear
from
posterity
most
of
the
fiction
i
grew
up
on
is
and
this
is
doubly
true
for
the
short
stories
losing
a
couple
bucks
to
people
who
would
have
bought
the
book
save
for
the
availability
of
the
free
electronic
text
is
no
big
deal
at
least
when
compared
to
the
horror
that
is
being
irrelevant
and
unread
and
luckily
for
me
it
appears
that
giving
away
the
text
for
free
gets
me
more
paying
customers
than
it
loses
me

leaned
across

upside

her
big
rings
clicking
against

temple
of

had

dodged

ahead

in
his
traditional

and
cape
dragging
a
cargo
net
full
of
rifles
from
his
belt
he
pulled
them
out
one
at
a
time
and
bent
them
into
fanciful
giraffes
poodles
and
passed
them
out
the
crowds
lining
yonge
street
it

been
a
boffo

and
it
made
great

hershie
abromowicz

his
mother

fingers
on
the
triggers
i
care
about
this
planet
and
i

sudden
do

have
to
be
off
with
these
how
come
you
did
to
be
with
the
crazy
people
until
now
because
there
a
now
the
world
is
ready
to
rethink
itself
because
the
waiter
saved
him
by
appearing
with
the
cheque
his
mother
started
to
open
her
purse
but
he
had
his
debitcard
on
the
table
faster
than
the
eye
could
follow
it
on
me
ma
do
be
silly
i
pay
i
to
let
me
a
son
should
take
his
mother
out
to
lunch
once
in
a
while
she
smiled
for
the
first
time
that
whole
afternoon
and
patted
his
cheek
with
one
manicured
hand
you
a
good
boy
hershie
i
know
that
i
only
want
that
you
should
be
happy
and
have
what
best
for
you
hershie
in
tights
and
cape
was
chilling
in
his
fortress
of
solitude
when
his
comm
rang
he
checked
the
callerid
and
winced
thomas
was
calling
from
toronto
hershie
bills
were
killing
him
ever
since
the
department
of
defense
had
cut
off
his
freebie
account
not
to
mention
that
talking
to
thomas
inevitably
led
to
more
trouble
with
his
mother
he
got
up
off
of
his
crystalline
recliner
and
flipped
the
comm
open
floating
up
a
couple
of
metres
thomas
what
up
supe
didja
see
the
reviews
the
critics
us
hersh
held
the
comm
away
from
his
head
and
sighed
the
ancient
hebraic
sigh
of
his
departed
stepfather
thomas
aquino
rusk
liked
to
play
at
being
a
sleazy
broadway
producer
his
plays
the
demonstrations
he
and
his
band
of
merry
hijacked
yeah
it
made
pretty
good
vid
all
right
he
did
ask
why
thomas
was
calling
there
was
only
one
reason
he
called
he
had
another
idea
you
never
guess
why
i
called
you
had
an
idea
i
had
an
idea
really
you
love
it
hershie
reached
out
and
stroked
the
coffins
that
his
birth
parents
lay
in
hoping
for
guidance
his
warm
fingers
slicked
with
melted
hoarfrost
and
as
they
skated
over
the
crypt
it
sang
a
pure
high
crystal
note
like
a
crippled
flying
saucer
plummeting
to
the
earth
i
sure
i
will
thomas
as
usual
thomas
chose
not
to
hear
the
sarcasm
in
his
voice
check
this
out
defensefest
is
being
held
in
toronto
in
march
and
the
new
keynote
speaker
is
the
patron
pat
the
fricken
head
fricken
bugout
his
address
is
history
and
military
tactics
a
strategic
overview
and
this
is
a
good
thing
ohfuckno
it
terrible
terrible
of
course
the
bugouts
are
selling
us
out
going
over
to
the
other
side
just
awful
but
think
of
the
possibilities
but
think
of
the
possibilities
oy
despite
himself
hershie
was
smiling
thomas
always
made
him
smile
you
smiling
are
you
shut
up
thomas
can
you
make
a
meeting
at
the
belquees
for
hershie
checked
his
comm
it
was
i
can
make
it
see
you
there
buddy
thomas
rang
off
hershie
folded
his
comm
wedged
it
in
his
belt
and
stroked
his
parents
crypt
once
more
for
luck
hershie
loved
the
commute
home
starting
at
the
arctic
circle
he
flew
up
and
up
and
up
above
the
highest
clouds
then
flattened
out
his
body
and
rode
the
currents
home
eeling
around
the
wet
frozen
cloudmasses
slaloming
through
thunderheads
his
critical
faculties
switched
off
flying
at
speed
on
blind
instinct
alone
he
usually
made
visual
contact
with
the
surface
around
barrie
just
outside
of
toronto
and
he
was
such
a
goodiegoodie
that
he
did
feel
a
thrill
of
superiority
as
he
flew
over
the
commuters
stuck
in
the
traffic
skis
and
snowmobiles
strapped
to
their
roofs
the
belquees
had
the
best
ethiopian
food
and
the
worst
ethiopian
decor
in
town
successive
generations
of
managers
had
added
their
own
touches
textured
wallpaper
framed
photos
of
haile
selassie
tribal
spears
and
grass
dolls
and
they
accreted
in
layers
until
the
net
effect
was
of
an
african
rummage
sale
but
man
the
food
was
good
downstairs
was
a
banquet
room
whose
decor
consisted
of
material
too
ugly
to
be
shown
upstairs
with
a
stage
and
a
disco
ball
it
had
been
a
regular
meeting
place
for
toronto
radicals
for
more
than
fifty
years
the
chairs
worn
smooth
by
generations
of
buttocks
tonight
it
was
packed
at
least
fifty
people
were
crammed
around
the
tables
tearing
off
hunks
of
tangy
and
scooping
up
vegetarian
curry
with
them
even
before
he
saw
thomas
his
had
already
picked
his
voice
out
of
the
din
and
located
it
hershie
made
a
beeline
for
thomas
table
not
making
with
the
others
activists
who
still
saw
him
as
a
tool
of
the
thomas
licked
his
fingers
clean
and
shook
his
hand
supe
glad
you
could
make
it
sit
sit
there
was
a
general
shuffling
of
coats
and
chairs
as
the
other
people
at
the
table
cleared
a
space
for
him
thomas
was
already
pouring
him
a
beer
out
of
one
of
the
pitchers
on
the
table
geez
how
many
people
did
you
invite
tina
a
tiny
chinese
woman
who
could
rhyme
hey
hey
ho
ho
and
one
two
three
four
with
amazing
facility
said
everyone
here
the
quakers
the
commies
a
couple
of
councilors
the
vets
anyone
we
could
think
of
this
is
gon
na
be
the
food
hot
and
the
different
curries
and
salads
were
a
symphony
of
flavours
and
textures
this
is
terrific
he
said
best
ethiopian
outside
of
addis
ababa
said
thomas
than
addis
hershie
thought
but
did
say
it
he
been
in
addis
ababa
as
the
secret
weapon
behind
canada
third
and
most
peacekeeping
mission
there
there
had
been
a
lot
of
restaurants
open
then
just
block
after
block
of
buildings
and
tribal
warlords
driving
around
in
tacticals
firing
randomly
at
anything
that
moved
the
ground
co
sent
him
off
to
scatter
bands
of
marauders
while
the
bullets
spanged
off
his
chest
he
never
understood
the
tactical
significance
of
those
actions
still
but
at
the
time
he
been
willing
to
trust
those
in
authority
good
food
he
said
an
hour
later
the
pretty
waitress
had
cleared
away
the
platters
and
brought
fresh
pitchers
and
hershie
tights
felt
a
little
tighter
one
of
the
quakers
an
ancient
skinny
man
with
thin
grey
hair
and
sharp
clever
features
stood
up
and
tapped
his
gradually
conversation
subsided
thank
you
he
said
my
name
is
stewart
pocock
and
i
here
from
the
circle
of
friends
i
like
us
all
to
take
a
moment
to
say
a
silent
thanks
for
the
wonderful
food
we
all
enjoyed
there
was
a
nervous
shuffling
and
then
a
general
bowing
of
heads
and
mostly
silence
broken
by
low
whispers
thomas
i
thought
called
this
meeting
hershie
whispered
i
did
these
guys
always
do
this
control
freaks
do
worry
about
it
he
whispered
back
thank
you
all
we
took
the
liberty
of
drawing
up
an
agenda
for
this
meeting
they
do
this
thomas
said
the
quakers
led
them
in
a
round
of
introductions
which
came
around
to
hershie
i
uh
the
super
man
i
guess
most
of
you
know
that
right
silence
really
looking
forward
to
working
on
this
with
you
all
a
moment
of
silence
followed
before
the
next
table
started
in
on
its
own
introductions
time
louise
pocock
said
blissfully
at
last
the
agenda
had
ticks
next
to
introduction
background
strategy
the
day
support
and
organising
and
publicity
thomas
had
hardly
spoken
a
word
through
the
course
of
the
meeting
even
hershie
alien
buttocks
were
numb
from
sitting
it
time
for
the
closing
circle
please
everybody
stand
up
and
hold
hands
many
of
the
assembled
did
bother
to
stifle
their
groans
awkwardly
around
the
tables
and
the
knapsacks
they
formed
a
rough
circle
and
took
hands
they
held
it
for
an
long
painful
moment
then
gratefully
let
go
they
worked
their
way
upstairs
and
outside
the
wind
had
picked
up
and
it
blew
hershie
cape
out
on
a
crackling
vertical
behind
him
so
that
it
caught
many
of
the
others
in
the
face
as
they
cycled
or
walked
away
supe
let
you
and
me
grab
a
coffee
huh
thomas
said
without
any
spin
on
it
at
all
so
that
hershie
knew
that
it
was
a
casual
request
yeah
sure
the
cafe
thomas
chose
was
in
a
renovated
bank
and
there
was
a
private
room
in
the
old
vault
and
they
sat
down
there
away
from
prying
eyes
and
autograph
hounds
so
you
pumped
thomas
said
after
they
ordered
coffees
after
meeting
yeah
sure
thomas
laughed
a
slightly
patronising
but
friendly
laugh
that
was
a
meeting
look
if
those
guys
had
their
way
we
have
about
a
march
a
month
and
we
walk
slowly
down
a
route
that
we
had
a
permit
for
politely
asking
people
to
see
our
point
of
view
and
in
between
we
have
a
million
meetings
like
this
where
we
come
up
with
brilliant
ideas
like
hand
out
fliers
next
time
so
what
we
do
is
go
along
with
them
give
them
enough
rope
to
hang
themselves
let
have
four
or
five
of
those
until
everyone
who
shows
up
is
so
bored
they
do
as
long
as
its
not
that
so
these
guys
want
to
stage
a
in
front
of
the
convention
centre
we
wait
until
they
ready
to
sit
down
then
we
start
playing
music
and
turn
it
into
a
start
playing
movies
on
the
side
of
the
building
bring
in
a
hundred
secret
agents
in
costume
to
add
to
it
they
never
know
what
hit
hershie
squirmed
these
kinds
of
machiavellian
shenanigans
came
slowly
to
him
that
seems
kind
of
well
disingenuous
thomas
why
do
we
just
hold
our
own
march
and
split
the
movement
no
this
is
much
better
these
guys
do
all
the
postering
and
phoning
they
get
a
good
crowd
out
this
is
their
natural
role
our
natural
role
my
son
he
placed
a
friendly
hand
on
hershie
caped
shoulder
is
to
see
to
it
that
their
efforts
are
defeated
by
their
own
poverty
of
imagination
they
the
feet
of
the
movement
but
we
its
thomas
pulled
out
his
comm
and
scribbled
on
its
surface
the
feet
of
the
movement
but
we
its
that
great
that
one
for
the
memoirs
hershie
decided
he
needed
to
patrol
a
little
to
clear
his
head
he
scooped
trash
and
syringes
from
grenadier
pond
he
flew
silently
through
high
park
ears
cocked
for
any
muggings
nothing
he
patrolled
the
gardner
expressway
next
and
used
his
heat
vision
to
melt
some
black
ice
feeling
useless
he
headed
for
home
he
was
most
of
the
way
up
yonge
street
when
he
heard
the
siren
a
cop
car
driving
fast
down
jarvis
he
sighed
his
father
sigh
and
rolled
east
heading
into
regent
park
locating
the
dopplering
siren
he
touched
down
lightly
on
top
of
one
of
the
ugly
squat
tenements
and
skipped
from
roof
to
roof
until
he
spotted
the
cop
he
was
beefy
with
the
traditional
moustache
and
the
flak
vest
that
they
all
wore
on
downtown
patrol
he
was
leaning
against
the
hood
of
his
cruiser
panting
his
breath
clouding
around
him
a
kid
rolled
on
the
ground
clutching
his
groin
gasping
for
breath
his
infrared
signature
throbbed
painfully
between
his
legs
clearly
he
been
kicked
in
the
nuts
the
cop
leaned
into
his
cruiser
and
lowered
the
volume
on
his
radio
then
without
warning
kicked
the
kid
in
the
small
of
the
back
the
kid
rolled
on
the
ice
thrashing
painfully
before
hershie
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
was
hovering
over
the
ice
between
the
cop
and
the
kid
the
cateyes
embedded
in
the
emblem
on
his
chest
glowed
in
the
streetlamps
the
cop
eyes
widened
so
that
hershie
could
see
the
whites
around
his
pupils
hershie
stared
what
do
you
think
you
doing
he
said
after
a
measured
silence
the
cop
took
a
step
back
and
slipped
a
little
on
the
ice
before
catching
himself
on
his
cruiser
since
when
do
you
kick
unarmed
civilians
in
the
back
he
he
ran
away
i
had
to
catch
him
i
wanted
to
teach
him
not
to
run
by
inspiring
his
trust
in
the
evenhandedness
of
toronto
finest
hershie
could
see
the
cooling
tracks
of
the
cruiser
skidding
and
weaving
through
the
projects
the
kid
had
put
up
a
good
chase
behind
him
he
heard
the
kid
regain
his
feet
and
start
running
the
cop
started
forward
but
hershie
stopped
him
with
one
finger
dead
centre
in
the
flak
jacket
you
ca
let
him
get
away
i
can
catch
him
trust
me
but
first
we
going
to
wait
for
your
backup
to
arrive
and
i
going
to
file
a
report
a
reporter
arrived
before
the
backup
unit
hershie
maintained
stony
silence
in
the
face
of
his
questions
but
he
could
stop
the
man
from
listening
in
on
his
conversation
with
the
old
constable
who
showed
up
a
few
minutes
later
as
he
filed
his
report
he
found
the
kid
a
few
blocks
away
huddled
in
an
alley
hand
pressed
to
the
small
of
his
back
he
took
him
to
mount
sinai
emerg
and
turned
him
over
to
a
uniformed
cop
the
hysterical
headlines
that
vilified
hershie
for
interfering
with
the
cop
sparked
a
round
of
recriminating
voicemails
from
his
mother
filled
with
promises
to
give
him
such
a
in
the
head
when
she
next
saw
him
he
folded
his
tights
and
cape
and
stuffed
them
in
the
back
of
his
closet
and
spent
a
lot
of
time
in
the
park
for
the
next
few
weeks
he
liked
to
watch
the
kids
playing
a
united
nations
in
miniature
parents
looking
on
amiably
stymied
by
the
language
barrier
that
their
kids
hurdled
with
ease
on
march
first
he
took
his
tights
out
of
the
overstuffed
hall
closet
and
flew
to
ottawa
to
collect
his
pension
he
touched
down
on
the
parliament
hill
and
was
instantly
surrounded
by
rcmp
constables
looking
slightly
panicky
he
held
his
hands
up
startled
what
gives
guys
sorry

said
high
security

of
them

me
hershie

and
started
past
him
the

extremely
unhappy
moved
to
block
him
i

only
people
on
the
list

hershie
looked
into
the
man
face
and
thought
about
hurtling
skywards
and
flying
straight
into
the
building
the
man
was
only
doing
his
job
though
look

tomorrow
tomorrow
my
rent
is
due
sergeant
look
what
if
i
comm
his
office
please
sir
that
would
be
fine
the
sergeant
looked
relieved
hershie
hit
a
speed
dial
and
waited
a
recorded
voice
told
him
that
the
office
was
closed
the
minister
at
a
special
session
he
in
session
look
it
probably
on
his
desk
i
been
coming
here
for
years
really
this
is
ridiculous
i
sorry
i
have
my
orders
i
do
think
you
could
stop
me
sergeant
the
sergeant
and
his
troops
shuffled
their
feet
you
probably
right
sir
but
orders
are
orders
you
know
sergeant
i
retired
a
full
colonel
from
the
armed
forces
i
order
you
to
let
me
past
sorry
sir
no
different
chain
of
command
hershie
controlled
his
frustration
with
an
effort
of
will
fine
then
i
be
back
tomorrow
the
building
super
was
pleased
about
the
late
rent
he
threatened
hershie
with
eviction
told
him
he
was
in
violation
of
the
lease
quoted
the
relevant
sections
of
the
tenant
protection
act
from
memory
then
grudgingly
gave
in
to
hershie
pleas
hershie
had
half
a
mind
to
put
his
costume
on
and
let
the
man
see
what
a
super
was
like
but
his
secret
identity
was
sacrosanct
even
in
the
era
of
pax
aliena
the
super
man
had
lots
of
enemies
all
of
whom
had
figured
out
long
before
that
even
the
invulnerable
have
weaknesses
their
friends
and
families
it
terrified
him
to
think
of
what
a
bitter
obsolete
terrorist
might
do
to
his
mother
to
thomas
or
even
his
old
girlfriends
for
his
part
thomas
refused
to
acknowledge
the
risk
he
was
more
worried
about
the
powers
that
be
than
mythical
terrorists
the
papers
the
next
day
were
full
of
the
overnight
cabinet
shuffle
in
ottawa
more
than
half
the
cabinet
had
been
relegated
to
the
and
many
of
their
portfolios
had
been
eliminated
or
amalgamated
into
the
new
superportfolios
domestic
affairs
trade
and
extraterrestrial
affairs
the
old
minister
of
defense
who
once
had
hershie
over
for
thanksgiving
dinner
was
banished
to
the
lowest
hell
of
the
his
portfolio
had
been
subsumed
into
extraterrestrial
affairs
and
the
new
minister
a
young
named
woolley
was
taking
hershie
calls
hershie
called
thomas
to
see
if
he
could
loan
him
rent
money
thomas
laughed
chickens
coming
home
to
roost
huh
he
said
what
that
supposed
to
mean
hershie
said
hotly
well
there
only
so
much
you
can
do
before
someone
sits
up
and
takes
notice
the
belquees
is
probably
bugged
or
maybe
one
of
the
commies
is
an
informer
either
way
you
screwed
especially
with
woolley
why
what
wrong
with
woolley
hershie
had
met
him
in
passing
at
prime
minister
office
affairs
a
he
seemed
like
a
nice
enough
guy
what
with
him
thomas
nearly
screamed
he
the
fricken
he
was
the
one
that
came
up
with
the
idea
of
selling
advertising
on
squeegee
kids
he
heavily
supported
by
private
security
outfits
he
makes
darth
vader
look
like
a
swell
guy
that
asshole
hershie
cut
him
off
ok
ok
i
get
the
idea
no
you
do
supe
you
do
get
the
half
of
it
this
guy
is
your
average
liberal
those
guys
usually
basic
opportunists
he
a
he
like
to
beat
us
with
i
went
to
one
of
his
debates
and
he
showed
up
with
a
he
tried
to
with
it
what
were
you
doing
at
the
time
what
does
it
matter
violence
is
never
an
acceptable
response
i
thrown
pies
at
better
men
than
him
hershie
grinned
thomas
had
invented
pieing
but
his
contributions
to
the
art
were
seminal
thomas
the
man
is
a
federal
minister
with
obligations
he
just
write
me
off
he
have
to
pay
me
sure
sure
thomas
crooned
of
he
will
who
ever
heard
of
a
politician
abusing
his
office
to
advance
his
agenda
i
do
know
what
i
was
thinking
i
apologise
hershie
touched
down
on
parliament
hill
heart
racing
thomas
warning
echoed
in
his
head
his
memories
of
woolley
were
already
morphing
so
that
the
slick
neat
kid
became
feral
predatory
the
hill
was
marshy
and
cold
and
gray
and
as
he
squelched
up
to
the
main
security
desk
he
felt
a
cold
ooze
of
mud
infiltrate
its
way
into
his
there
was
a
new
rcmp
constable
on
duty
a
turbanned
sikh
normally
he
felt
awkward
around
the
sikhs
in
the
mounties
he
imagined
that
their
lack
of
cultural
context
made
his
tights
and
emblem
seem
absurd
that
they
evoked
grins
beneath
the
sikhs
fierce
moustaches
but
today
he
was
glad
the
man
was
a
sikh
another
foreigner
with
an
uneasy
berth
in
the
canadian
complex
the
sikh
was
expressionless
as
hershie
squirted
his
clearances
from
his
comm
to
the
security
desk
transceiver
imperturbably
the
sikh
squirted
back
directions
to
woolley
new
office
just
a
short
jaunt
from
the
exalted
heights
of
the
prime
minister
office
the
minister
office
was
guarded
by
a
dignified
antique
door
that
had
the
rich
finish
of
wood
that
has
been
buffed
daily
for
two
centuries
an
rcmp
constable
in
plainclothes
a
young
handsome
receptionist
in
a
silk
navy
a
slightly
older
office
manager
whose
beauty
was
only
barely
restrained
by
her
chaste
blouse
and
skirt
and
finally
a
pair
of
boardroom
doors
with
spotless
brass
handles
and
a
retinal
scanner
each
obstacle
took
more
time
to
weather
than
the
last
so
it
was
nearly
an
hour
before
the
office
manager
stared
fixedly
into
the
scanner
until
the
locks
opened
with
a
soft
clack
hershie
squelched
in
leaving
a
slushy
dribble
on
the
muted
brown
carpet
woolley
knelt
on
the
stool
of
an
ergonomic
enveloped
in
an
articulated
nest
of
displays
comms
keyboards
datagloves
immersive
headsets
stylii
sticky
notes
and
his
posture
hair
and
expression
rivaled
for
flawlessness
hello
hello
he
said
giving
hershie
hand
a
dry
firm
pump
he
smelled
of
expensive
talc
and
leather
car
interiors
he
led
hershie
to
a
pair
of
stark
scandinavian
chairs
whose
polished
lead
undersides
bristled
with
knobs
the
old
minister
tastes
had
run
to
imposing
oak
desks
and
horsehair
and
hershie
felt
a
disorientation
as
he
sank
into
the
brilliantly
functional
it
chittered
like
a
roulette
wheel
and
shifted
to
firmly
support
him
thanks
for
seeing
me
hershie
said
he
caught
his
reflection
in
the
bulletproof
glass
windows
that
faced
out
over
the
rideau
canal
and
felt
a
flush
of
embarrassment
when
he
saw
how
clownish
his
costume
looked
in
the
practical
environs
woolley
favoured
him
with
half
a
smile
and
stared
sincerely
with
eyes
that
were
widely
spaced
clever
and
hazel
surrounded
by
smile
lines
the
man
fairly
oozed
charisma
i
should
be
thanking
you
i
was
just
about
to
call
you
to
set
up
a
meeting
why
have
you
been
taking
my
hershie
thought
lamely
he
said
you
were
i
was
i
wanted
to
touch
base
with
you
clarify
the
way
that
we
were
going
to
operate
from
now
on
hershie
felt
his
gorge
rise
from
now
on
i
phrased
that
badly
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this
is
a
new
cabinet
a
new
ministry
it
has
its
own
modus
operandi
how
can
it
have
its
own
modus
operandi
when
it
was
only
created
last
night
hershie
said
hating
the
petulance
in
his
voice
oh
i
like
to
keep
lots
of
contingency
plans
on
hand
the
time
to
plan
for
major
changes
is
far
in
advance
otherwise
you
end
up
running
around
trying
to
get
office
furniture
and
telephones
installed
when
you
need
to
be
seizing
opportunity
it
struck
hershie
how
the
office
was
the
staff
the
systems
the
security
he
imagined
woolley
hearing
the
news
of
his
appointment
and
calling
up
files
containing
schematics
purchase
orders
staff
requisitions
it
exactly
devious
but
it
certainly
teetered
on
the
meridian
separating
and
well
you
certainly
seem
to
have
everything
in
order
i
been
giving
some
thought
to
your
payment
arrangement
did
you
know
that
there
a
whole
body
of
policy
relating
to
your
pension
hershie
nodded
not
liking
where
this
was
going
well
that
just
not
sensible
woolley
said
sensibly
the
canadian
government
already
has
its
own
pension
apparatus
we
make
millions
of
every
day
for
welfare
pensions
employment
insurance
allowance
we
up
to
our
armpits
in
payment
infrastructure
and
having
you
fly
up
to
ottawa
every
month
well
it
ridiculous
this
is
the
century
we
have
better
ways
of
moving
money
around
i
been
giving
it
some
thought
and
i
come
up
with
a
solution
that
should
make
everything
easier
for
everyone
i
going
to
transfer
your
pension
to
the
canada
pension
plan
offices
they
make
a
monthly
deposit
directly
to
your
account
i
got
the
paperwork
all
filled
out
here
all
you
need
to
do
is
fill
in
your
banking
information
and
your
social
insurance
number
but
i
do
have
a
social
insurance
number
or
a
bank
account
hershie
said
of
course
hershie
abromowicz
had
both
but
the
super
man
did
how
do
you
pay
taxes
then
woolley
had
a
dangerous
smile
well
i
hershie
stammered
i
do
i
i
never
had
to
pay
taxes
or
get
a
bank
account
i
just
take
my
cheques
to
the
canadian
union
of
public
employees
credit
union
and
they
cash
them
for
me
it
the
woolley
shook
his
head
who
told
you
you
were
he
asked
wonderingly
is
except
status
indians
as
to
not
having
a
bank
account
well
you
can
open
an
account
at
the
cupe
credit
union
and
make
the
deposits
there
but
not
until
this
tax
status
matter
is
cleared
up
you
have
to
talk
to
revenue
canada
about
getting
a
sin
and
get
that
information
to
canada
pensions
i
through
my
secret
identity
but
does
this
he
made
quote
marks
with
his
fingers
declare
your
pension
income
of
course
i
do
i
have
to
keep
my
secret
identity
a
his
voice
was
shrill
in
his
own
ears
it
a
i
served
in
the
forces
as
the
super
man
so
i
get
paid
as
the
super
man
tax
exempt
no
bank
accounts
no
sin
just
a
cheque
every
month
woolley
leaned
back
and
clasped
his
hands
in
his
lap
i
know
that
how
it
used
to
be
but
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
today
is
that
arrangement
however
longstanding
however
was
proper
or
even
it
had
to
end
some
time
you
retired
now
you
do
need
your
identity
again
with
the
if
you
already
have
a
sin
you
can
just
give
it
to
me
along
with
your
secret
identity
bank
information
and
we
can
have
your
pension
processed
in
a
week
or
two
week
or
hershie
bellowed
i
need
to
pay
my
that
not
how
it
works
woolley
stood
abruptly
no
sir
that
how
it
works
i
trying
to
be
reasonable
i
trying
to
expedite
things
for
you
during
this
time
of
transition
but
you
need
to
meet
me
halfway
if
you
could
give
me
your
sin
and
account
information
right
now
i
could
speed
things
up
considerably
i
sure
i
willing
to
make
that
effort
even
though
things
are
very
busy
here
hershie
toyed
with
the
idea
of
demolishing
the
man
office
turning
his
lovely
furniture
into
molten
nacho
topping
and
finishing
up
by
leaving
the
man
dangling
by
his
suit
from
the
cn
tower
needle
but
his
mother
would
kill
him
i
ca
give
you
my
secret
identity
hershie
said
pleadingly
it
a
matter
of
national
security
i
just
need
enough
to
pay
my
rent
woolley
stared
at
the
ceiling
for
a
long
long
time
there
is
one
thing
he
said
yes
hershie
said
hating
himself
for
the
note
of
hope
in
his
voice
the
people
at
defensefest
called
my
office
yesterday
to
see
if
i
appear
as
a
guest
speaker
with
the
patron
pat
i
had
to
turn
them
down
of
course
i
far
too
busy
right
now
but
i
sure
they
be
happy
to
have
a
veteran
of
your
reputation
in
that
slot
and
it
carries
a
substantial
honorarium
i
could
call
them
for
you
and
give
them
your
comm
hershie
thought
of
thomas
and
of
the
rent
and
of
his
mother
and
of
all
the
people
at
the
belquees
who
stared
mistrustfully
at
him
have
them
call
me
he
sighed
i
talk
to
them
he
got
to
his
feet
the
toe
of
his
boot
squelching
out
more
dirt
pudding
hershie
yes
mama
she
caught
him
on
the
way
home
flying
high
over
the
fleabag
motels
on
the
old
highway
it
friday
she
said
right
friday
he
told
her
he
come
for
dinner
and
that
meant
getting
there
before
sunset
i
be
there
he
said
oh
it
not
important
it
just
me
do
hurry
on
my
account
after
all
you
have
thousands
of
shabbas
dinners
with
your
mother
i
live
forever
i
said
i
be
there
and
do
wear
that
costume
she
said
she
hated
the
costume
when
the
department
of
defense
had
issued
it
to
him
she
wanted
to
know
why
they
were
sending
her
boy
into
combat
wearing
red
satin
panties
i
change
that
a
good
boy
she
said
i
making
brisket
by
the
time
he
touched
down
on
the
roof
of
his
building
he
knew
he
be
late
for
dinner
he
skimmed
down
the
elevator
shaft
to
the
tenth
floor
and
ducked
out
to
his
apartment
only
to
find
the
door
padlocked
there
was
a
note
from
the
building
super
tacked
to
the
peeling
green
paint
among
other
things
it
quoted
the
codicil
from
the
tenant
protection
act
that
allowed
the
super
to
padlock
the
door
and
forbade
hershie
on
penalty
of
law
from
doing
anything
about
it
hershie
picked
up
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
down
the
hallway
in
a
blur
he
flew
up
to
the
ceiling
and
hovered
there
pressing
himself
flat
on
the
acoustic
tile
one
of
his
neighbours
that
guy
with
the
bohemian
attitude
who
always
seemed
to
be
laughing
at
poor
nebbishy
hershie
abromowicz
made
his
way
down
the
hall
he
paused
directly
below
hershie
still
hovering
form
reading
the
note
on
the
door
while
he
adjusted
the
collar
of
his
he
smirked
at
the
note
and
got
in
the
elevator
hershie
let
himself
float
to
the
ground
his
cheeks
burning
damn
it
he
did
have
for
this
not
for
any
of
it
he
considered
the
padlock
for
a
moment
then
snapped
the
hasp
with
his
thumb
and
index
finger
moving
through
the
apartment
with
superhuman
speed
he
changed
into
a
pair
of
nice
slacks
a
sweater
his
mother
had
given
him
for
his
last
birthday
a
tweedy
jacket
and
a
woolen
overcoat
opening
a
window
he
took
flight
thomas
i
ca
talk
right
now
he
said
his
mother
was
angrily
drumming
her
rings
on
the
table
edge
abruptly
she
grabbed
the
bowl
of
cooling
soup
from
his
place
setting
and
carried
it
into
the
kitchen
she
done
this
since
he
was
a
kid
but
it
still
inspired
the
same
panicky
dread
in
him
if
he
was
going
to
eat
his
dinner
she
was
going
to
leave
it
supe
we
to
talk
about
this
i
mean
defensefest
is
only
a
week
away
we
got
things
to
do
look
about
defensefest
yes
thomas
had
a
wary
note
in
his
voice
hershie
mother
reappeared
with
a
plate
laden
with
brisket
tsimmis
and
kasha
she
set
it
down
in
front
of
him
we
talk
later
ok
hershie
said
but
what
about
defensefest
it
complicated
hershie
began
his
mother
scooped
up
the
plate
of
brisket
and
headed
back
to
the
kitchen
she
was
muttering
furiously
i
have
to
go
he
said
and
closed
his
comm
hershie
chased
his
mother
and
snatched
the
plate
from
her
as
she
held
it
dramatically
over
the
sink
disposal
he
held
up
his
comm
with
the
other
hand
and
made
a
show
of
powering
it
down
it
off
mama
please
come
and
eat
i
been
thinking
of
selling
the
house
she
said
as
they
tucked
into
slices
of
lemon
hershie
put
down
his
fork
sell
the
house
while
his
father
had
exactly
the
house
with
his
own
hands
he
had
sold
his
guts
out
at
his
discount
menswear
store
to
pay
for
it
his
mother
had
decorated
it
but
his
essence
still
haunted
the
corners
why
would
you
sell
the
house
oh
it
too
big
hershie
i
just
one
old
lady
and
it
not
like
any
grandchildren
to
come
and
stay
i
could
buy
a
condo
in
florida
and
be
plenty
left
over
for
you
i
do
need
any
money
mama
i
got
my
pension
she
covered
his
hands
with
hers
of
course
you
do
bubbie
but
fixed
incomes
are
for
old
men
you
young
you
need
a
nest
egg
something
to
start
a
family
with
her
sharp
eyes
sunk
into
motherly
pillows
of
soft
flesh
bored
into
him
he
tried
to
keep
his
gaze
light
and
carefree
you
got
money
problems
she
said
at
length
hershie
scooped
up
a
forkful
of
and
shook
his
head
his
powers
of
perception
bordered
on
clairvoyance
and
he
did
trust
himself
to
speak
the
lie
outright
he
looked
around
the
dining
room
furnished
with
faux
chinoise
screens
oriental
rugs
angular
chandeliers
tell
mama
she
said
he
sighed
and
finished
the
cake
it
the
new
minister
he
wo
give
me
my
pension
unless
i
tell
him
my
secret
identity
so
his
mother
said
you
so
ashamed
of
your
parents
you
rather
starve
than
tell
the
world
that
their
bigshot
hero
is
hershie
abromowicz
i
for
one
would
mind
finally
i
could
speak
up
when
my
girlfriends
are
going
on
about
their
sons
the
lawyers
mom
he
said
feeling
all
of
eight
years
old
i
not
ashamed
and
you
know
it
but
if
the
world
knew
who
i
was
well
who
knows
what
kind
of
danger
be
in
i
made
some
powerful
enemies
mama
enemies
shmenemies
she
said
waving
her
hands
do
worry
yourself
on
my
account
do
make
me
the
reason
that
you
end
up
in
the
cold
i
not
helpless
you
know
i
have
mace
hershie
thought
of
the
battles
he
fought
the
soldiers
the
mercenaries
the
terrorists
the
crooks
and
the
with
their
insane
plots
and
impractical
apparati
his
mother
was
as
formidable
as
an
elderly
jewish
woman
with
no
grandchildren
could
be
but
she
was
no
match
for
automatic
weapons
i
ca
do
it
mama
it
would
be
responsible
can
we
drop
it
fine
we
wo
talk
about
it
anymore
but
a
mother
you
sure
you
do
need
any
money
he
cast
about
desperately
for
a
way
to
placate
her
i
fine
i
got
a
speaking
engagement
lined
up
there
was
a
message
waiting
on
his
comm
when
he
powered
it
back
up
a
message
from
a
relentlessly
cheerful
woman
with
a
chirpy
texas
accent
who
identified
herself
as
the
programming
coordinator
for
defensefest
she
hoped
he
would
return
her
call
that
night
hershie
hovered
in
a
dark
cloud
over
the
lake
the
wind
blowing
his
coat
straight
back
holding
the
comm
in
his
hand
he
squinted
through
the
clouds
and
distance
until
he
saw
his
apartment
building
a
row
of
windows
lit
up
like
teeth
his
darkened
window
a
gap
in
the
smile
he
did
mind
the
cold
it
was
much
colder
in
his
fortress
of
solitude
but
his
apartment
was
more
than
warmth
it
was
his
own
shabby
homey
corner
of
the
hideously
expensive
city
on
the
flight
from
his
mother
he
found
an
bill
folded
neatly
and
stuck
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
overcoat
he
returned
the
phone
call
the
super
was
happy
about
being
roused
from
his
sitcoms
but
he
grudgingly
allowed
hershie
to
squirt
the
rent
money
at
his
comm
he
wanted
to
come
up
and
take
the
padlock
but
hershie
talked
him
into
turning
over
the
key
promising
to
return
it
in
the
morning
his
apartment
was
a
little
with
a
constant
symphony
of
groaning
radiators
every
stick
of
furniture
in
it
had
been
rescued
from
kerbsides
while
hershie
flew
his
night
patrols
saving
chairs
sofas
and
even
a
scarred
walnut
armoire
from
the
trashman
hershie
sat
at
the
round
formica
table
and
commed
thomas
it
me
he
said
what
up
he
did
want
to
beat
around
the
bush
i
speaking
at
defensefest
then
going
on
tour
six
months
speaking
at
military
shows
it
pays
well
very
well
very
very
well
well
enough
that
he
would
have
to
worry
about
his
pension
the
promoters
had
sorted
his
tax
status
out
with
the
irs
who
would
happily
exempt
him
totally
freeing
him
from
entanglements
with
revenue
canada
the
cheerful
texan
had
been
to
do
it
he
waited
for
thomas
trademark
stream
of
vitriol
it
did
come
very
quietly
thomas
said
i
see
thomas
he
said
a
note
of
pleading
in
his
voice
it
not
my
choice
if
i
do
do
this
i
have
to
give
woolley
my
secret
identity
he
wo
give
me
my
pension
without
my
social
insurance
number
or
you
could
get
a
job
thomas
said
the
familiar
invective
snarl
creeping
back
i
just
told
you
i
ca
give
out
my
sin
so
have
your
secret
identity
get
a
job
wash
dishes
if
i
took
a
job
hershie
said
palms
sweating
i
have
to
give
up
flying
patrols
i
have
to
stop
fighting
crime
thomas
voice
was
remorseless
what
the
bugouts
are
taking
care
of
crime
they
making
plans
to
shut
down
the
supe
you
been
obsoleted
i
know
hershie
said
i
know
that
why
i
got
involved
with
you
in
the
first
place
i
need
to
have
a
i
the
super
man
so
your
purpose
is
speaking
to
military
shows
telling
the
world
that
it
still
needs
its
arsenals
even
if
the
bugouts
have
made
war
obsolete
great
purpose
supe
very
noble
he
choked
on
a
hopeless
sob
so
what
can
i
do
thomas
i
do
want
to
sell
out
but
i
got
to
squeeze
coal
into
diamonds
he
said
it
was
teasing
but
not
nasty
teasing
hershie
felt
his
tension
slip
thomas
did
hate
him
do
you
have
any
idea
how
big
a
piece
of
coal
you
have
to
start
with
to
get
even
a
stone
trust
me
someone
would
notice
if
entire
coalfaces
started
disappearing
look
supe
this
is
surmountable
you
do
have
to
sell
out
you
said
it
yourself
you
the
super
man
you
have
responsibilities
you
have
duties
you
ca
just
sell
out
let
sleep
on
it
huh
hershie
was
so
very
very
tired
it
was
always
hardest
on
him
when
the
yellow
sun
was
hidden
the
moon
was
a
paltry
substitute
for
its
rejuvenating
rays
let
do
that
he
said
thanks
thomas
defensefest
opened
its
doors
on
one
of
those
incredibly
bright
march
days
when
the
snow
on
the
ground
throws
back
lumens
sufficient
to
shrink
your
pupils
to
microdots
despite
the
day
brightness
a
bitterly
cold
wind
scoured
front
street
and
the
metro
convention
centre
from
a
distance
hershie
watched
demonstration
muster
out
front
of
the
eaton
centre
a
few
kilometers
north
and
march
down
to
front
street
along
their
route
the
turnout
was
good
especially
given
the
weather
about
showed
up
with
wooly
scarves
and
placards
that
the
wind
kept
threatening
to
tear
loose
from
their
grasp
the
veterans
marched
out
front
under
a
banner
in
full
uniform
next
came
the
quakers
who
were
of
the
same
vintage
as
the
veterans
but
dressed
like
elderly
english
professors
next
came
three
different
communist
factions
who
circulated
back
and
forth
trying
to
sell
each
other
magazines
finally
there
came
the
rabble
thomas
group
of
anarchists
students
with
packsacks
who
industriously
commed
their
browbeaten
classmates
elected
to
stay
at
their
desks
civilians
who
seen
a
notice
and
come
out
and
tried
gamely
to
keep
up
with
the
chanting
the
chanting
got
louder
as
they
neared
the
security
cordon
around
the
convention
centre
the
different
groups
all
mingled
as
they
massed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
barricades
the
quakers
and
the
vets
sang
give
peace
a
chance
while
thomas
and
his
cohort
prowled
around
distributing
materiel
to
various
trusted
individuals
the
students
hollered
abuse
at
the
attendees
who
were
trickling
into
the
convention
centre
in
expensive
overcoats
florid
with
breakfasts
and
immaculately
groomed
hershie
appearance
silenced
the
crowd
he
screamed
in
over
the
lake
banked
vertically
up
the
side
of
the
cn
tower
and
plummeted
downward
the
demonstrators
set
up
a
loud
cheer
as
he
skimmed
the
crowd
then
fell
silent
and
aghast
as
he
touched
down
on
the
side
of
the
barricade
with
the
a
cop
in
held
the
door
for
him
and
he
stepped
inside
a
groan
went
up
from
the
protestors
and
swelled
into
a
wordless
furious
howl
hershie
avoided
the
show
floor
and
headed
for
the
green
room
en
route
he
was
stopped
by
a
somali
general
who
been
acquitted
by
a
war
crimes
tribunal
but
only
barely
the
man
greeted
him
like
an
old
comrade
and
got
his
aide
to
snap
a
photo
of
the
two
of
them
shaking
hands
the
green
room
was
crowded
with
presenters
who
pecked
furiously
at
their
comms
revising
their
slides
hershie
drew
curious
stares
when
he
entered
but
by
the
time
he
gotten
his
danish
and
coffee
everyone
around
him
was
once
again
bent
over
their
work
a
field
of
balding
cabbages
anointed
with
products
hershie
palms
were
slick
his
alien
hearts
throbbing
in
counterpoint
his
cowlick
wilted
in
the
aggressive
heat
shimmering
out
of
the
vent
behind
his
sofa
he
tried
to
keep
himself
calm
but
by
the
time
a
gofer
commed
him
and
squirted
directions
to
the
main
ballroom
he
was
a
wreck
hershie
commed
into
the
feed
from
the
demonstration
in
time
to
see
the
quakers
sit
en
masse
along
the
barricade
hands
intertwined
asses
soaking
in
the
slush
at
the
kerbside
the
cops
watched
them
impassively
and
while
they
were
distracted
thomas
gave
a
signal
to
his
crew
who
hastily
unreeled
a
smartscreen
the
gossamer
fabric
snapping
taut
in
the
wind
as
it
unfurled
over
the
convention
centre
facade
the
cops
were
suddenly
alert
moving
but
thomas
was
careful
to
keep
the
screen
on
his
side
of
the
barricade
tina
led
a
team
of
students
who
spread
out
a
solar
collector
the
size
and
consistency
of
a
parachute
it
glinted
in
the
harsh
sun
szandor
hastily
cabled
a
apparatus
to
the
collector
szandor
dog
nipped
at
his
heels
as
he
steadied
and
focused
the
apparatus
on
the
screen
and
szandor
plugged
his
comm
into
it
and
powered
it
up
there
was
a
staticky
pop
as
the
speakers
came
to
life
loud
enough
to
be
heard
over
the
street
noise
the
powerful
projector
beamed
its
image
onto
the
screen
bright
even
in
the
midday
glare
there
were
hoots
from
the
crowd
as
they
recognised
the
feed
a
live
broadcast
of
the
keynote
addresses
in
the
centre
the
patron
pat
hoverchair
prominent
the
camera
lingered
on
the
patron
eyes
the
only
part
of
him
visible
from
within
the
chair
masking
infrastructure
they
were
startling
silvery
orbs
and
expressionless
the
camera
swung
to
hershie
szandor
spat
dramatically
and
led
a
chorus
of
hisses
hershie
hastily
closed
his
comm
and
cleared
his
throat
adjusted
his
mic
and
addressed
the
crowd
uh
he
said
his
guts
somersaulted
time
to
go
big
or
go
home
hi
that
was
better
thanks
i
the
super
man
for
years
i
worked
alongside
un
peacekeeping
forces
around
the
world
i
hoped
i
was
doing
good
work
most
of
the
time
i
suppose
i
may
have
been
he
caught
the
eye
of
brenda
the
cheerful
texan
who
booked
him
in
she
looked
uneasy
there
one
thing
i
certain
of
though
it
that
the
preparation
for
war
has
never
led
to
anything
war
with
this
show
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
are
participating
in
a
giant
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
individually
you
may
not
be
evil
but
collectively
you
the
most
amoral
supervillain
i
ever
faced
brenda
was
talking
frantically
into
her
comm
his
mic
died
he
simply
expanded
his
mighty
diaphragm
and
kept
on
speaking
his
voice
filling
the
ballroom
i
urge
you
to
put
this
behind
you
we
entered
into
a
new
era
in
human
history
the
good
patron
here
offers
the
entire
universe
you
scurry
around
arranging
the
deaths
of
people
you
never
met
it
a
terribly
stupid
mindless
pursuit
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourselves
with
that
hershie
stepped
away
from
the
podium
and
walked
out
of
the
ballroom
the
camera
tracked
him
as
he
made
his
way
back
through
the
convention
centre
out
the
doors
he
leapt
the
barricade
and
settled
in
front
of
the
screen
the
demonstrators
gave
him
a
standing
ovation
and
thomas
gravely
shook
his
hand
the
handshake
was
repeated
on
the
giant
screen
behind
them
courtesy
of
the
cameraman
who
had
gamely
vaulted
the
barricade
as
well
the
crowd
danced
hugged
each
other
laughed
szandor
dog
bit
him
on
the
ass
and
he
nearly
dropped
the
projector
he
recovered
in
time
to
nearly
drop
it
again
as
the
patron
hoverchair
glided
out
the
centre
doors
and
made
a
beeline
for
hershie
hershie
watched
the
car
approach
with
nauseous
dread
the
patron
stopped
a
few
centimetres
from
him
so
they
were
almost
the
pa
popped
to
life
and
the
patron
spoke
in
the
bugouts
thrilling
contralto
thank
you
for
your
contribution
the
bugout
said
it
was
refreshing
to
have
another
perspective
presented
hershie
tried
for
a
heroic
nod
i
glad
you
were
offended
on
the
contrary
it
was
stimulating
i
shall
have
to
speak
with
the
conference
organisers
this
format
seems
a
good
one
for
future
engagements
hershie
felt
his
expression
slipping
sliding
towards
incredulity
he
struggled
to
hold
it
then
lost
it
entirely
when
one
of
the
patron
silvery
eyes
drooped
closed
in
an
unmistakable
wink
hi
mama
hershie
i
just
saw
it
on
the
television
he
cringed
back
from
his
comm
as
he
shrank
deeper
into
the
corner
of
the
belquees
that
he
moved
to
when
his
comm
rang
mama

all
right
they
signed

for
the
full
six
months
