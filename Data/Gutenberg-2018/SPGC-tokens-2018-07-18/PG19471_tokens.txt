pariah
the
air
of
the
city
cheapest
flophouse
was
thick
with
the
smells
of
harsh
antiseptic
and
unwashed
bodies
the
early
christmas
snowstorm
had
driven
in
every
bum
who
could
steal
or
beg
the
price
of
admission
and
the
long
rows
of
cots
were
filled
with
fully
clothed
figures
those
who
could
afford
the
extra
dime
were
huddled
under
thin
grimy
blankets
the
pariah
who
had
been
daniel
feldman
enjoyed
no
such
luxury
he
tossed
fitfully
on
a
bare
cot
bringing
his
face
into
the
dim
light
it
had
been
a
handsome
face
but
now
the
black
stubble
of
beard
lay
over
gaunt
features
and
sunken
cheeks
he
looked
ten
years
older
than
his
scant
and
there
were
the
beginnings
of
a
snarl
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
clothes
that
had
once
been
expensive
were
wrinkled
and
covered
with
grime
that
no
amount
of
cleaning
could
remove
his
tall
thin
body
was
awkwardly
curled
up
in
a
vain
effort
to
conserve
heat
and
one
of
his
hands
instinctively
clutched
at
his
tiny
bag
of
possessions
he
stirred
again
and
suddenly
jerked
upright
with
a
protest
already
forming
on
his
lips
the
ugly
surroundings
registered
on
his
eyes
and
he
stared
suspiciously
at
the
other
cots
but
there
was
no
sign
that
anyone
had
been
trying
to
rob
him
of
his
bindle
or
the
precious
bag
of
cheap
tobacco
he
started
to
relax
back
onto
the
couch
when
a
sound
caught
his
attention
even
over
the
snoring
of
the
others
it
was
a
low
wail
the
sound
of
a
man
who
can
no
longer
control
himself
feldman
swung
to
the
cot
on
his
left
as
the
moan
hacked
off
the
man
there
was
well
fed
and
but
his
face
was
gray
with
sickness
he
was
writhing
and
clutching
his
stomach
arching
his
back
against
the
misery
inside
him
feldman
diagnosed
he
had
no
need
of
the
weak
answering
nod
he
treated
such
cases
several
times
in
the
past
the
disease
was
usually
caused
by
the
absence
of
gravity
out
in
space
but
it
could
be
brought
on
later
from
abuse
of
the
weakened
internal
organs
such
as
the
intake
of
too
much
bad
liquor
the
man
must
have
been
frequenting
the
wrong
bars
now
he
was
obviously
dying
violent
peristaltic
contractions
seemed
to
be
tearing
the
intestines
out
of
him
and
the
paroxysms
were
coming
faster
his
eyes
darted
to
feldman
tobacco
sack
and
there
was
animal
appeal
in
them
feldman
hesitated
then
reluctantly
rolled
a
smoke
he
held
the
cigarette
while
the
spaceman
took
a
long
gasping
drag
on
it
he
smoked
the
remainder
himself
letting
the
harsh
tobacco
burn
against
his
lungs
and
sicken
his
empty
stomach
then
he
shrugged
and
threaded
his
way
through
the
narrow
aisles
toward
the
attendant
better
get
a
doctor
he
said
bitterly
when
the
young
punk
looked
up
at
him
you
got
a
man
dying
of
on
the
sneer
on
the
kid
face
deepened
yeah
we
do
pay
for
doctors
every
time
some
wino
wants
to
throw
up
forget
it
and
get
back
where
you
belong
bo
you
have
a
corpse
on
your
hands
in
an
hour
feldman
insisted
i
know
damn
it
the
kid
turned
back
to
his
lottery
sheet
go
treat
yourself
if
you
wanta
play
doctor
go
on
scram
before
i
toss
you
out
in
the
snow
one
of
feldman
hands
reached
for
the
attendant
then
he
caught
himself
he
started
to
turn
back
hesitated
and
finally
faced
the
kid
again
i
not
fooling
and
i
a
doctor
he
stated
my
name
is
daniel
feldman
the
attendant
nodded
absently
until
the
words
finally
penetrated
he
looked
up
studied
feldman
with
surprised
curiosity
and
growing
contempt
and
reached
for
the
phone
gim
me
medical
directory
he
muttered
feldman
felt
the
kid
eyes
on
his
back
as
he
stumbled
through
the
aisles
to
his
cot
again
he
slumped
down
rolling
another
cigarette
in
hands
that
shook
the
sick
man
was
approaching
delirium
now
and
the
moans
were
mixed
with
weak
whining
sounds
of
fear
other
men
had
wakened
and
were
watching
but
nobody
made
a
move
to
help
the
retching
and
writhing
of
the
sick
man
had
begun
to
weaken
but
it
was
still
not
too
late
to
save
him
hot
water
and
skillful
massage
could
interrupt
the
paroxysms
in
fifteen
minutes
feldman
could
have
stopped
the
attack
completely
he
found
his
feet
on
the
floor
and
his
hands
already
reaching
out
savagely
he
pulled
himself
back
sure
he
could
save
the
man
and
wind
up
in
the
gas
chamber
there
be
no
mercy
for
his
second
offense
against
lobby
laws
if
the
spaceman
lived
feldman
might
get
off
with
a
flogging
that
was
standard
punishment
for
a
pariah
who
stepped
out
of
line
but
with
his
luck
there
would
be
a
heart
arrest
and
another
juicy
story
for
the
papers
idealism
the
medical
lobby
made
a
lot
out
of
the
word
but
it
for
him
a
pariah
had
no
business
thinking
of
others
as
feldman
sat
there
staring
the
spaceman
grew
quieter
sometimes
even
at
this
stage
massage
could
help
it
was
harder
without
liberal
supplies
of
hot
water
but
the
massage
was
the
really
important
treatment
it
was
the
trembling
of
feldman
hands
that
stopped
him
he
no
longer
had
the
strength
or
the
certainty
to
make
the
massage
effective
he
was
glaring
at
his
hands
in
when
the
legal
doctor
arrived
the
man
was
old
and
tired
probably
he
had
been
another
idealist
who
had
wound
up
defeated
content
to
leave
things
up
to
the
established
procedures
of
the
medical
lobby
he
looked
it
as
he
bent
over
the
dying
man
the
doctor
turned
back
at
last
to
the
attendant
too
late
the
best
i
can
do
is
ease
his
pain
the
call
should
have
been
made
half
an
hour
earlier
he
had
obviously
never
handled
before
he
administered
a
hypo
that
probably
held
narconal
feldman
watched
his
guts
tightening
sympathetically
for
the
shock
that
would
be
to
the
sick
man
but
at
least
it
would
shorten
his
sufferings
the
final
seizure
lasted
only
a
minute
or
so
hopeless
the
doctor
said
his
eyes
were
clouded
for
a
moment
and
then
he
shrugged
well
i
make
out
a
death
certificate
anyone
here
know
his
name
his
eyes
swung
about
the
cots
until
they
came
to
rest
on
feldman
he
frowned
and
a
twisted
smile
curved
his
lips
feldman
is
it
you
still
look
something
like
your
pictures
do
you
know
the
deceased
feldman
shook
his
head
bitterly
no
i
do
know
his
name
i
even
know
why
he
was
cyanotic
at
the
end
it
was
do
you
doctor
the
old
man
threw
a
startled
glance
at
the
corpse
then
he
shrugged
and
nodded
to
the
attendant
well
go
through
his
things
if
he
still
has
a
space
ticket
i
can
get
his
name
from
that
the
kid
began
pawing
through
the
bag
that
had
fallen
from
the
cot
he
dragged
out
a
pair
of
shoes
half
a
bottle
of
cheap
rum
a
wallet
and
a
bronze
space
ticket
he
was
quick
enough
with
the
wallet
and
the
doctor
took
it
from
him
medical
lobby
authorization
if
he
has
any
money
it
covers
my
fee
and
the
rest
goes
to
his
own
lobby
there
were
several
bills
all
of
large
denominations
he
turned
the
ticket
over
and
began
filling
in
the
death
certificate
arthur
billings
space
lobby
crewman
cause
of
death
idiopathic
gastroenteritis
delirium
tremens
there
had
been
no
evidence
of
delirium
tremens
but
apparently
the
doctor
felt
he
had
scored
a
point
he
tossed
the
space
ticket
toward
the
shoes
closed
his
bag
and
prepared
to
leave
hey
doc
the
attendant
voice
was
indignant
hey
what
about
my
reporting
fee
the
doctor
stopped
he
glanced
at
the
kid
then
toward
feldman
his
face
a
mixture
of
speculation
and
dislike
he
took
a
dollar
bill
from
the
wallet
that
right
he
admitted
the
fee
for
reporting
a
solvent
case
medical
lobby
rules
apply
even
to
a
man
who
breaks
them
the
kid
hand
was
out
but
the
doctor
dropped
the
dollar
onto
cot
there
your
fee
pariah
he
left
forcing
the
protesting
attendant
to
precede
him
feldman
reached
for
the
bill
it
was
blood
money
for
letting
a
man
die
but
it
meant
cigarettes
and
food
or
shelter
for
another
night
if
he
could
get
a
mission
meal
he
no
longer
could
afford
pride
grimly
he
pocketed
the
bill
staring
at
the
face
of
the
dead
man
it
looked
back
sightlessly
now
showing
a
faint
speckling
of
tiny
dots
they
caught
feldman
eyes
and
he
bent
closer
there
should
be
no
black
dots
on
the
skin
of
a
man
who
died
of
and
there
should
have
been
cyanosis
he
swore
and
bent
down
to
find
the
wrecks
of
his
shoes
he
worry
about
anything
now
but
getting
away
from
here
before
the
attendant
made
trouble
his
eyes
rested
on
the
shoes
of
the
dead
man
sturdy
boots
that
would
last
for
another
year
they
could
do
the
corpse
no
good
someone
else
would
steal
them
if
he
did
but
he
hesitated
cursing
himself
the
right
boot
fitted
better
than
he
could
have
expected
but
something
got
in
the
way
as
he
tried
to
put
the
left
one
on
his
fingers
found
the
bronze
ticket
he
turned
it
over
considering
it
he
was
ready
to
fraud
his
identity
for
what
he
heard
of
life
on
the
spaceships
yet
but
he
shoved
it
into
his
pocket
and
finished
lacing
the
boots
outside
the
snow
was
still
falling
but
it
had
turned
to
slush
and
the
sidewalk
was
soggy
underfoot
there
was
going
to
be
no
work
shoveling
snow
he
realized
this
would
melt
before
the
day
was
over
feldman
hunched
the
suitcoat
up
shivering
as
the
cold
bit
into
him
the
boots
felt
good
though
if
he
had
socks
they
would
have
been
completely
comfortable
he
passed
a
cheap
restaurant
and
the
smell
of
the
synthetics
set
his
stomach
churning
it
had
been
two
days
since
his
last
real
meal
and
the
dollar
burned
in
his
pocket
but
he
had
to
wait
there
was
a
fair
chance
this
early
that
he
could
scavenge
something
edible
he
shuffled
on
after
a
while
the
cold
bothered
him
less
and
he
passed
through
the
hunger
spell
he
rolled
another
smoke
and
sucked
at
it
hardly
thinking
it
was
better
that
way
it
was
much
later
when
the
big
caduceus
set
into
the
sidewalk
snapped
him
back
to
awareness
of
where
he
traveled
his
undirected
feet
had
led
him
much
too
far
uptown
following
old
habits
this
was
the
medical
lobby
building
where
he
spent
more
than
enough
time
including
three
weeks
in
custody
before
they
stripped
him
of
all
rank
and
status
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
ornate
entrance
where
he
first
emerged
as
a
pariah
he
meant
to
walk
down
those
steps
as
if
he
were
still
a
man
but
each
step
had
drained
his
resolution
until
he
finally
covered
his
face
and
slunk
off
knowing
himself
for
what
the
world
had
branded
him
he
stood
there
now
staring
at
the
smug
young
medical
politicians
and
the
tired
old
general
practitioners
filing
in
and
out
one
of
the
latter
halted
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
quarter
merry
christmas
he
said
dully
feldman
fingered
the
coin
then
he
saw
a
gray
medical
policeman
watching
him
and
he
knew
it
was
time
to
move
on
sooner
or
later
someone
would
recognize
him
here
he
clutched
the
quarter
and
turned
to
look
for
a
coffee
shop
that
sold
the
synthetics
to
which
his
metabolism
had
been
switched
no
shop
would
serve
him
here
but
he
could
buy
coffee
and
a
piece
of
cake
to
take
out
a
flurry
of
motion
registered
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
and
he
glanced
back
taxi
taxi
the
girl
rushing
down
the
steps
had
a
clear
soprano
voice
cultured
and
commanding
the
gray
medical
uniform
seemed
molded
to
her
shapely
figure
and
her
red
hair
glistened
in
the
lights
of
the
street
her
snub
nose
and
determined
mouth
were
the
current
fashion
but
nobody
stopped
to
think
of
fashions
when
they
saw
her
she
did
have
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
president
of
medical
lobby
to
rule
it
was
chris
chris
feldman
once
and
now
chris
ryan
again
feldman
swung
toward
a
cab
for
a
moment
his
attitude
was
automatic
and
assured
and
the
cab
stopped
before
the
driver
noticed
his
clothes
he
picked
up
the
bag
chris
dropped
and
swung
it
onto
the
front
seat
she
was
fumbling
in
her
change
purse
as
he
turned
back
to
shut
the
door
thank
you
my
good
man
she
said
she
could
be
gracious
even
to
a
pariah
when
his
homage
suited
her
she
dropped
two
quarters
into
his
hand
raising
her
eyes
recognition
flowed
into
them
followed
by
icy
shock
she
yanked
the
cab
door
shut
and
shouted
something
to
the
driver
the
cab
took
off
with
a
rush
that
left
feldman
in
a
backwash
of
slush
and
mud
he
glanced
down
at
the
coins
in
his
hand
it
was
his
lucky
day
he
thought
bitterly
he
moved
across
the
street
and
away
not
bothering
about
the
squeal
of
brakes
and
the
honking
horns
he
looked
back
only
once
toward
the
glowing
sign
that
topped
the
building
health
is
our
business
then
the
great
symbol
of
the
health
business
faded
behind
him
and
he
stumbled
on
sucking
incessantly
at
the
cigarettes
he
rolled
one
hand
clutched
the
bronze
badge
belonging
to
the
dead
man
and
his
stolen
boots
drove
onward
through
the
melting
snow
it
was
christmas
in
the
year
on
the
protectorate
of
earth
ii
lobby
feldman
had
set
his
legs
the
problem
of
heading
for
the
great
spaceport
and
escape
from
earth
and
he
let
them
take
him
without
further
guidance
his
mind
was
wrapped
up
in
a
whirl
of
the
past
his
past
and
that
of
the
whole
planet
both
pasts
had
in
common
the
growth
and
sudden
ruin
of
idealism
idealism
throughout
history
some
men
had
sought
the
ideal
and
most
had
called
it
freedom
only
fools
expected
absolute
freedom
but
wise
men
dreamed
up
many
systems
of
relative
freedom
including
democracy
they
had
tried
that
in
america
as
the
last
fling
of
the
dream
it
had
been
a
good
attempt
too
the
men
who
drew
the
constitution
had
been
pretty
practical
dreamers
they
came
to
their
task
after
a
bitter
war
and
a
worse
period
of
wild
chaos
and
they
had
learned
where
idealism
stopped
and
idiocy
began
they
set
up
a
republic
with
all
the
elements
of
democracy
that
they
considered
safe
it
had
worked
well
enough
to
make
america
the
number
one
power
of
the
world
but
the
men
who
followed
the
framers
of
the
new
plan
were
a
different
sort
without
the
knowledge
of
practical
limits
the
privileges
their
ancestors
had
earned
in
blood
and
care
became
automatic
rights
practical
men
tried
to
explain
that
there
were
no
such
rights
that
each
generation
had
to
pay
for
its
rights
with
responsibility
that
kind
of
talk
did
get
far
people
wanted
to
hear
about
rights
not
about
duties
they
took
the
phrase
that
all
men
were
created
equal
and
left
out
the
implied
kicker
that
equality
was
in
the
sight
of
god
and
before
the
law
they
wanted
an
equality
with
the
greatest
men
without
giving
up
their
drive
toward
mediocrity
and
they
meant
to
have
it
in
a
way
they
got
it
they
got
the
vote
extended
to
everyone
the
man
on
subsidy
or
public
dole
could
vote
to
demand
more
the
man
who
read
of
nothing
beyond
sex
crimes
could
vote
on
the
great
political
issues
of
the
world
no
ability
was
needed
for
his
vote
in
fact
he
was
assured
that
voting
alone
was
enough
to
make
him
a
fine
and
noble
citizen
he
loved
that
if
he
bothered
to
vote
at
all
that
year
he
became
a
great
man
by
listing
his
unthought
hungry
desire
for
someone
to
take
care
of
him
without
responsibility
so
he
went
out
and
voted
for
the
man
who
promised
him
most
or
who
looked
most
like
what
his
limited
dreams
felt
to
be
a
father
image
or
son
image
or
hero
image
he
never
bothered
later
to
see
how
the
men
he
elected
had
handled
the
jobs
he
had
given
them
someone
had
to
look
of
course
and
someone
did
organized
special
interests
stepped
in
where
the
mob
had
failed
lobbies
grew
up
there
had
always
been
pressure
groups
but
now
they
developed
into
a
third
arm
of
the
government
the
old
farm
lobby
was
unbeatable
the
big
farmers
shaped
the
laws
they
wanted
they
convinced
the
little
farmers
it
was
for
the
good
of
all
and
they
made
the
story
stick
well
enough
to
swing
the
farm
vote
they
made
the
laws
when
it
came
to
food
and
crops
the
last
of
the
great
lobbies
was
space
probably
it
was
an
accident
that
grew
up
so
fast
it
never
even
knew
it
was
a
real
part
of
the
government
it
developed
during
a
period
of
chaos
when
another
country
called
russia
got
the
first
hunk
of
metal
above
the
atmosphere
and
when
the
representatives
who
had
been
picked
for
everything
but
their
grasp
of
science
and
government
went
into
panic
over
a
myth
of
national
prestige
the
space
effort
was
turned
over
to
the
aircraft
industry
which
had
never
been
able
to
manage
itself
successfully
except
under
the
stimulus
of
war
or
a
threat
of
war
the
failing
airplane
industry
became
the
space
combine
overnight
and
nobody
kept
track
of
how
big
it
was
except
a
few
sharp
operators
they
worked
out
a
system
of
subcontracts
that
spread
the
profits
so
wide
that
hardly
a
company
of
any
size
in
the
country
was
getting
a
share
thus
a
lot
of
patriotic
noble
voters
got
their
pay
from
companies
in
the
lobby
block
and
could
be
panicked
by
the
lobby
at
the
first
mention
of
recession
so
space
lobby
took
over
completely
in
its
own
field
it
developed
enough
pressure
to
get
whatever
appropriations
it
wanted
even
over
presidential
veto
it
created
the
only
space
experts
which
meant
that
the
men
placed
in
government
agencies
to
regulate
it
came
from
its
own
ranks
the
other
lobbies
learned
a
lot
from
space
there
had
been
a
medical
lobby
long
before
but
it
had
been
a
conservative
group
mostly
concerned
with
protecting
medical
autonomy
and
ethics
it
also
tried
to
prevent
government
control
of
treatment
and
payment
feeling
that
it
could
trust
the
people
to
know
where
to
stop
but
its
history
was
a
long
series
of
retreats
it
fought
what
it
called
socialized
medicine
but
the
people
wanted
their
troubles
handled
free
which
meant
by
government
spending
since
that
could
be
added
to
the
national
debt
and
thus
did
seem
to
cost
anything
it
lost
and
eventually
the
government
paid
most
medical
costs
with
doctors
working
on
a
fixed
fee
then
quantity
of
treatment
paid
rather
than
quality
competence
no
longer
mattered
so
much
the
lobby
lost
but
did
know
it
because
the
lowered
standards
of
competence
in
the
profession
lowered
the
caliber
of
men
running
the
political
aspects
of
that
profession
as
exemplified
by
the
lobby
it
took
a
plague
to
turn
the
tide
the
plague
began
in
old
china
anything
could
start
there
with
more
than
a
billion
people
huddled
in
one
area
and
a
few
madmen
planning
to
conquer
the
world
it
might
have
been
a
laboratory
mutation
but
nobody
could
ever
prove
it
it
wiped
out
two
billion
people
depopulated
africa
and
most
of
asia
and
wrecked
europe
leaving
only
america
comparatively
safe
to
take
over
an
obscure
scientist
in
one
of
the
laboratories
run
by
the
medical
lobby
found
a
cure
before
the
first
waves
of
the
epidemic
hit
america
rutherford
ryan
then
head
of
the
lobby
made
sure
that
medical
lobby
got
all
the
credit
by
the
time
the
world
recovered
america
ran
it
and
the
medical
lobby
was
untouchable
ryan
made
a
deal
with
space
lobby
and
the
two
effectively
ran
the
world
none
of
the
smaller
lobbies
could
buck
them
and
neither
could
the
government
there
was
still
a
president
and
a
congress
as
there
had
been
a
senate
under
the
roman
caesars
but
the
two
lobbies
ran
themselves
as
they
chose
the
real
government
had
become
a
kind
of
oligarchy
as
it
always
did
after
too
much
false
democracy
ruined
the
ideals
of
real
and
practical
a
man
belonged
to
his
lobby
just
as
a
serf
had
belonged
to
his
feudal
landlord
it
was
a
safe
world
now
maybe
progress
had
been
halted
at
about
the
level
of
but
so
long
as
the
citizens
did
break
the
rules
of
their
lobbies
they
had
very
little
to
worry
about
for
that
for
security
and
the
right
not
to
think
most
people
were
willing
to
leave
well
enough
alone
some
rules
seemed
harsh
of
course
such
as
the
law
that
all
operations
had
to
be
performed
in
lobby
hospitals
but
that
could
be
justified
it
was
the
only
safe
kind
of
surgery
and
the
only
way
to
make
sure
there
was
no
unsupervised
experimentation
such
as
that
which
supposedly
caused
the
plague
the
rule
was
now
an
absolute
ethic
of
medicine
it
also
made
for
better
fees
feldman
father
had
stuck
by
the
rule
but
had
questioned
it
feldman
learned
not
to
question
in
medical
school
he
scored
second
in
medical
ethics
only
to
christina
ryan
he
had
never
figured
why
she
singled
him
out
for
her
attentions
but
he
gloried
in
both
those
attentions
and
the
results
he
became
automatically
a
rising
young
man
the
favorite
of
the
daughter
of
the
lobby
president
he
went
through
internship
without
a
sign
of
trouble
chris
humored
him
in
his
desire
to
spend
three
years
of
practice
in
a
poor
section
loaded
with
disease
and
her
father
approved
such
selfless
dedication
was
the
perfect
image
projection
for
a
future
in
return
he
agreed
to
follow
that
period
by
becoming
an
administrator
a
doctor
doctor
as
they
put
it
they
were
married
in
april
and
his
office
was
ready
in
may
complete
with
a
staff
of
eighty
the
publicity
releases
had
gone
out
and
the
public
relations
lobby
that
handled
news
and
education
was
paid
to
begin
the
greatest
any
young
genius
ever
had
they
celebrated
that
with
a
little
party
of
some
four
hundred
people
and
reporters
at
ryan
lodge
in
canada
it
was
to
be
a
gala
weekend
it
was
then
that
baxter
shot
himself
baxter
had
been
feldman
closest
friend
in
the
lobby
he
come
along
to
handle
press
relations
and
had
gotten
romantic
about
the
countryside
never
having
been
out
of
a
city
before
he
hired
a
guide
and
went
hunting
eighty
miles
beyond
the
last
outpost
of
civilization
somehow
he
got
his
hand
on
a
gun
though
only
guides
were
supposed
to
touch
them
managed
to
overcome
its
safety
devices
and
then
pulled
the
trigger
with
the
gun
pointed
the
wrong
way
chris
feldman
and
harnett
from
public
relations
had
accompanied
him
on
the
trip
they
were
sitting
in
a
nearby
car
while
feldman
enjoyed
the
scenery
chris
made
further
plans
and
harnett
gathered
material
there
was
also
a
photographer
and
writer
but
they
had
been
introduced
by
name
feldman
reached
baxter
first
the
man
was
moaning
and
scared
and
he
was
bleeding
profusely
only
a
miracle
had
saved
him
from
instant
death
the
bullet
had
struck
a
rib
been
deflected
and
robbed
of
some
of
its
energy
and
had
barely
reached
the
heart
but
it
had
pierced
the
pericardium
as
best
feldman
could
guess
and
it
could
be
fatal
at
any
moment
he
reached
for
a
probe
without
thinking
chris
knocked
his
hand
aside
she
was
right
of
course
he
could
operate
outside
a
hospital
but
they
had
no
phone
in
the
lodge
where
the
guide
lived
and
no
way
to
summon
an
ambulance
they
have
to
drive
baxter
back
in
the
car
which
would
almost
certainly
result
in
his
death
when
feldman
seemed
uncertain
harnett
had
given
his
warning
in
a
low
but
vehement
voice
you
touch
him
dan
and
i
spread
it
in
every
one
of
our
media
i
have
to
it
the
only
way
to
retain
public
confidence
there
be
a
leak
with
all
the
guides
and
others
here
and
we
ca
afford
that
i
like
you
you
have
color
but
touch
that
wound
and
i
crucify
you
chris
added
her
own
threats
she
spent
years
making
him
the
outlet
for
all
her
ambitions
denied
because
women
were
still
only
members
of
medical
lobby
she
could
let
it
go
now
and
she
was
probably
genuinely
shocked
baxter
groaned
again
and
started
to
bleed
more
profusely
there
was
much
equipment
feldman
operated
with
a
pocketknife
sterilized
in
a
bottle
of
expensive
scotch
and
only
anodyne
tablets
in
place
of
anesthesia
he
got
the
bullet
out
and
sewed
up
the
wound
with
a
bit
of
surgical
thread
he
been
using
to
tie
up
a
torn
emblem
the
photographer
and
writer
recorded
the
whole
thing
chris
swore
harshly
and
beat
her
fists
against
the
bole
of
a
tree
but
baxter
lived
he
recovered
completely
and
was
shocked
at
the
heinous
thing
that
had
been
done
to
him
they
crucified
feldman
iii
spaceman
most
crewmen
lived
rough
ugly
lives
and
usually
short
ones
passengers
and
officers
on
the
big
tubs
were
given
the
equivalent
of
gravity
in
spinning
compartments
but
the
crews
rode
free
the
lucky
crewmen
lived
through
their
accidents
got
now
and
then
and
recovered
nobody
cared
about
the
others
feldman
ticket
was
for
the
and
nobody
questioned
his
identity
he
suffered
through
the
agony
of
acceleration
on
the
shuttle
up
to
the
orbital
station
then
was
sick
as
acceleration
stopped
but
he
was
able
to
control
himself
enough
to
follow
other
crewmen
down
a
hall
of
the
station
toward
the
the
big
ships
never
touched
a
planet
always
docking
at
the
stations
a
checker
met
the
crew
and
reached
for
their
badges
he
barely
glanced
at
them
punched
a
mark
for
each
on
his
checkoff
sheet
and
handed
them
back
deckmen
forward
tubemen
to
the
rear
he
ordered
blasts
in
fifteen
minutes
hey
you
you
tubes
feldman
grunted
he
should
have
expected
it
tubemen
had
the
lowest
lot
of
all
the
crew
between
the
killing
work
the
heat
of
the
tubes
and
occasional
doses
of
radiation
their
lives
were
worth
the
metal
value
of
their
tickets
he
began
pulling
himself
clumsily
along
a
shaft
dodging
freight
the
loaders
were
tossing
from
hand
to
hand
a
bag
hit
his
head
drawing
blood
and
another
caught
him
in
the
groin
watch
it
bo
a
loader
yelled
at
him
you
dent
that
bag
and
brig
you
cantcha
see
it
got
a
special
courtesy
stripe
it
had
a
brilliant
green
stripe
he
saw
it
also
had
a
name
printed
in
block
letters
that
shouted
their
identity
before
he
could
read
the
words
christina
ryan
southport
and
he
had
to
choose
this
time
to
leave
earth
suddenly
he
was
glad
he
was
assigned
to
the
tubes
it
was
the
one
place
on
the
ship
where
he
be
least
likely
to
run
into
her
as
a
doctor
and
a
courtesy
passenger
she
have
complete
run
of
the
ship
but
hardly
bother
with
the
dangerous
and
unpleasant
tube
section
he
dragged
his
way
back
beginning
to
sweat
with
the
effort
the
was
an
old
ship
a
lot
of
the
handholds
were
missing
and
he
had
to
throw
himself
along
by
erratic
leaps
he
was
gaining
proficiency
but
not
enough
to
handle
himself
if
the
ship
blasted
off
time
was
growing
short
when
he
reached
the
aft
bunkroom
where
the
other
tubemen
were
waiting
ben
one
husky
introduced
himself
tube
chief
know
how
to
work
this
feldman
could
see
that
they
were
assembling
a
small
still
he
heard
of
the
phenomenal
quantities
of
beer
spacemen
drank
and
now
he
realized
what
really
happened
to
it
hard
liquor
was
supposed
to
be
forbidden
but
they
made
their
own
i
can
work
it
he
decided
i
uh
dan
okay
dan
ben
glanced
at
the
clock
hit
the
sacks
boys
by
the
time
feldman
could
settle
into
the
sacklike
hammock
the
began
to
shake
faintly
and
weight
piled
up
it
was
mild
compared
to
that
on
the
shuttle
since
the
big
ships
could
take
high
acceleration
space
had
been
conquered
for
more
than
a
century
but
the
ships
were
still
flimsy
tubs
that
took
months
to
reach
mars
using
immense
amounts
of
fuel
only
the
valuable
plant
hormones
from
mars
made
commerce
possible
at
the
ridiculously
high
freight
rate
three
hours
later
he
began
to
find
out
why
spacemen
did
seem
to
fear
dying
or
turning
pariah
the
tube
quarters
had
grown
insufferably
hot
during
the
long
blast
but
the
main
was
blistering
as
ben
led
the
men
into
it
the
chief
handed
out
spacesuits
and
motioned
for
dan
greenhorn
aincha
okay
i
take
you
with
me
we
go
out
in
the
tubes
and
pull
the
lining
i
pry
up
the
stuff
you
carry
it
back
here
and
stack
it
they
sealed
off
the
pumped
out
the
air
and
went
into
the
steaming
mildly
radioactive
tubes
just
big
enough
for
a
man
on
hands
and
knees
beyond
the
tube
mouth
was
empty
space
waiting
for
the
man
who
slipped
ben
began
ripping
out
the
eroded
blocks
with
a
special
tool
feldman
carried
them
back
and
stacked
them
along
with
others
a
plasma
furnace
melted
them
down
into
new
blocks
the
work
grew
progressively
worse
as
the
distance
to
the
increased
the
tube
mouth
yawned
closer
and
closer
there
were
no
handholds
there
only
the
friction
of
a
man
body
in
the
tube
life
settled
into
a
dull
routine
of
labor
sleep
and
the
brief
relief
of
the
crude
white
mule
from
the
still
they
were
six
weeks
out
and
almost
finished
with
the
tube
cleaning
when
number
two
tube
blew
bits
of
the
remaining
radioactive
fuel
must
have
collected
slowly
until
they
reached
feldman
in
number
one
would
have
gone
sailing
out
into
space
but
ben
reacted
at
once
as
the
ship
leaped
slightly
feldman
brought
up
sharply
against
the
braced
body
for
a
second
their
fate
hung
in
the
balance
then
it
was
over
and
ben
shoved
him
back
grinning
faintly
he
jerked
his
thumb
and
touched
helmets
briefly
there
they
go
dan
the
two
men
who
had
been
working
in
number
two
were
charred
lumps
drifting
out
into
space
no
further
comment
was
made
on
it
except
that
they
have
to
work
harder
from
now
on
since
they
were
shorthanded
that
rest
period
feldman
came
down
with
a
mild
attack
of
which
meant
no
more
drinking
for
him
and
was
off
work
for
a
day
then
the
pace
picked
up
the
tubes
were
cleared
and
they
began
laying
the
new
lining
for
the
landing
blasts
there
was
no
time
for
thought
after
that
mars
orbital
station
lay
close
when
the
work
was
finished
ben
slapped
feldman
on
the
back
ya
ai
bad
for
a
greenie
dan
we
all
get
passes
on
mars
hit
the
sack
now
so
you
wo
waste
time
sleeping
then
we
hear
it
when
the
ship
berths
feldman
did
hear
it
but
the
others
did
he
felt
ben
shaking
his
shoulder
trying
to
drag
him
out
of
the
sack
grab
your
junk
dan
ben
picked
up
feldman
nearly
empty
bag
and
tossed
it
toward
him
before
his
eyes
were
fully
open
he
grabbed
for
it
and
missed
he
grabbed
again
with
ben
laughter
in
his
ears
the
bag
hit
the
wall
and
fell
open
spilling
its
contents
feldman
began
gathering
it
up
but
the
chief
was
no
longer
laughing
a
big
hand
grabbed
up
the
space
ticket
suddenly
and
there
was
no
friendliness
now
on
ben
face
art
billing
card
ben
told
the
other
tubemen
five
trips
i
made
with
art
he
was
saving
his
money
going
to
buy
a
farm
on
mars
five
trips
and
one
more
to
go
before
he
had
enough
now
you
show
up
with
his
ticket
the
tubemen
moved
forward
toward
feldman
there
was
no
indecision
to
them
apparently
trial
had
been
held
and
sentence
passed
wait
a
minute
feldman
began
billings
died
of
a
fist
snaked
past
his
raised
hand
and
connected
with
his
jaw
he
bounced
off
a
wall
a
wrench
sailed
toward
him
glanced
off
his
arm
and
ripped
at
his
muscles
another
heavy
fist
struck
abruptly
ben
voice
cut
through
their
yells
hold
it
he
shoved
through
the
group
tossing
men
backwards
stow
it
we
can
take
care
of
him
later
right
now
this
is
captain
business
you
fools
want
to
lose
your
leave
he
indicated
two
of
the
others
you
two
bring
him
along
and
keep
him
quiet
the
two
grabbed
feldman
arms
and
dragged
him
along
as
the
chief
began
pulling
his
way
forward
through
the
tubes
up
towards
the
control
section
of
the
ship
feldman
took
a
quick
glance
at
their
faces
and
made
no
effort
to
resist
they
obviously
would
have
enjoyed
any
chance
to
subdue
him
they
were
stopped
twice
by
minor
officers
then
sent
on
they
finally
found
the
captain
near
the
exit
lock
apparently
assisting
the
passengers
to
leave
most
of
them
went
on
into
the
shuttle
but
chris
ryan
remained
behind
as
the
captain
listened
to
ben
report
and
inspected
the
false
ticket
finally
the
captain
turned
to
feldman
you
what
your
name
chris
eyes
were
squarely
on
feldman
cold
and
furious
he
doctor
daniel
feldman
captain
marker
she
stated
feldman
stood
paralyzed
he
been
unwilling
to
face
chris
he
wanted
to
avoid
all
the
past
but
the
idea
that
she
would
denounce
him
had
never
entered
his
head
there
was
no
medical
rule
involved
she
knew
that
as
a
pariah
he
was
forbidden
to
board
a
passenger
ship
of
course
but
been
his
wife
once
marker
bowed
slightly
to
her
thank
you
ryan
i
should
take
this
criminal
back
to
earth
in
chains
i
suppose
but
he
hardly
worth
the
freightage
you
men
want
to
take
him
down
to
mars
and
ground
him
there
ben
grinned
and
touched
his
forelock
thank
you
sir
we
enjoy
that
good
his
pay
reverts
to
the
ship
fund
that
all
men
feldman
started
to
protest
but
a
fist
lashed
savagely
against
his
mouth
he
made
no
other
protests
as
they
dragged
him
into
the
crew
shuttle
that
took
off
for
southport
he
avoided
their
eyes
and
sat
hunched
over
it
was
ben
who
finally
broke
the
silence
what
happened
to
art
money
he
had
a
pile
on
him
go
to
hell
give
i
said
ben
twisted
his
arm
back
toward
his
shoulder
applying
increasing
pressure
a
doctor
took
it
for
his
fee
when
billings
died
of
damn
you
i
could
help
him
ben
looked
at
the
others
med
lobby
fee
eh
all
the
market
will
take
umm
it
could
be
maybe
he
shrugged
okay
reasonable
doubt
we
wo
kill
you
bo
not
quite
we
wo
the
shuttle
landed
and
ben
handed
out
the
little
helmets
and
aspirators
that
made
life
possible
in
mars
thin
air
outside
the
tubemen
took
turns
holding
feldman
and
beating
him
while
the
passengers
disembarked
from
their
shuttle
as
he
slumped
into
unconsciousness
he
had
a
picture
of
chris
ryan
frozen
face
as
she
moved
steadily
toward
the
port
station
iv
martian
it
was
night
when
feldman
came
to
and
the
temperature
was
dropping
rapidly
he
struggled
to
sit
up
through
a
fog
of
pain
somewhere
in
his
bag
he
should
have
an
anodyne
tablet
that
would
kill
any
ache
he
finally
found
the
pill
and
swallowed
it
fumbling
with
the
aspirator
lip
opening
the
aspirator
meant
life
to
him
now
he
suddenly
realized
he
twisted
to
stare
at
the
tiny
for
the
battery
it
showed
then
he
saw
that
someone
had
attached
another
battery
beside
it
he
puzzled
briefly
over
it
but
his
immediate
concern
was
for
shelter
apparently
he
was
still
where
he
had
been
knocked
out
there
was
a
light
coming
from
the
little
station
and
he
headed
toward
that
fumbling
for
the
few
quarters
that
represented
his
entire
fortune
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
if
the
tubemen
had
killed
him
batteries
were
an
absolute
necessity
here
food
and
shelter
would
be
expensive
and
he
had
no
skills
to
earn
his
way
at
most
he
had
only
a
day
or
so
left
but
meantime
he
had
to
find
warmth
before
the
cold
killed
him
the
tiny
restaurant
in
the
station
was
still
open
and
the
air
was
warm
inside
he
pulled
off
the
aspirator
shutting
off
the
battery
the
counterman
did
even
glance
up
as
he
entered
feldman
gazed
at
the
printed
menu
and
flinched
soup
he
ordered
it
was
the
cheapest
item
he
could
find
the
counterman
stared
at
him
obviously
spotting
his
earth
origin
you
adjusted
to
synthetics
feldman
nodded
earth
operated
on
a
mixed
diet
with
synthetics
for
all
who
could
afford
the
natural
foods
there
but
mars
was
all
synthetic
many
of
the
chemicals
in
food
could
exist
in
either
of
two
forms
or
isomers
they
were
chemically
alike
but
differently
crystallized
sometimes
either
form
was
digestible
but
frequently
the
body
could
use
only
the
isomer
to
which
it
was
adjusted
martian
plants
produced
different
isomers
from
those
on
earth
since
the
synthetic
foods
turned
out
to
be
that
was
probably
the
more
natural
form
research
designed
to
let
the
early
colonists
live
off
native
food
here
had
turned
up
an
enzyme
that
enabled
the
body
to
handle
either
isomer
in
a
few
weeks
of
eating
martian
or
synthetic
food
the
body
adapted
without
more
enzyme
it
lost
its
power
to
handle
food
the
cheapness
of
synthetics
and
the
discovery
that
many
diseases
common
to
earth
would
not
attack
bodies
led
to
the
wide
use
of
synthetics
on
earth
no
pariah
could
have
been
expected
to
afford
feldman
finished
the
soup
and
found
a
cigarette
that
was
smokable
any
objections
if
i
sit
in
the
waiting
room
he
expected
a
rejection
but
the
counterman
only
shrugged
the
waiting
room
was
almost
dark
and
the
air
was
chilly
but
there
was
normal
pressure
he
found
a
bench
and
slumped
onto
it
lighting
his
cigarette
he
miss
the
smokes
but
probably
not
for
long
he
finished
the
cigarette
reluctantly
and
sat
huddled
on
the
bench
waiting
for
morning
the
airlock
opened
later
and
feet
sounded
on
the
boards
of
the
floor
but
he
did
look
up
until
a
thin
beam
of
light
hit
him
then
he
sighed
and
nodded
the
shoes
made
of
some
odd
fiber
did
look
like
those
of
a
cop
but
this
was
mars
he
could
see
only
a
hulking
shadow
behind
the
light
you
the
man
who
was
a
medical
doctor
the
voice
was
dry
and
old
yeah
feldman
answered
once
good
thought
that
space
crewman
was
just
lying
drunk
at
first
come
along
doc
why
it
did
matter
but
if
they
wanted
him
to
move
on
they
have
to
push
a
little
harder
the
light
swung
up
to
show
the
other
he
was
the
shade
of
old
leather
with
a
bleached
patch
of
sandy
hair
and
the
deepest
gray
eyes
feldman
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
face
that
could
have
belonged
to
a
country
storekeeper
in
new
england
with
the
same
hint
of
dry
humor
the
man
was
dressed
in
padded
levis
and
a
leather
jacket
of
unguessable
age
his
aspirator
seemed
worn
and
patched
and
one
big
hand
fumbled
with
it
because
we
friends
doc
the
voice
drawled
at
him
because
you
might
as
well
come
with
us
as
sit
here
maybe
we
have
a
job
for
you
feldman
shrugged
and
stood
up
if
the
man
was
a
lobby
policeman
he
was
different
from
the
usual
kind
nothing
could
be
worse
than
the
present
prospects
they
went
out
through
the
doors
of
the
waiting
room
toward
a
rattletrap
vehicle
it
looked
something
like
a
cross
between
a
schoolboy
jalopy
and
a
army
tank
of
former
times
the
treads
were
caterpillar
style
and
the
stubby
body
was
completely
enclosed
a
tiny
airlock
stuck
out
from
the
rear
two
men
were
inside
both
bearded
the
old
man
grinned
at
them
mark
lou
meet
doc
feldman
sit
doc
i
jake
mullens
and
you
might
say
we
were
farmers
the
motor
started
with
a
wheeze
the
tractor
swung
about
and
began
heading
away
from
southport
toward
the
desert
dunes
it
shook
and
rattled
but
it
seemed
to
make
good
time
i
do
know
anything
about
farming
feldman
protested
jake
shrugged
no
of
course
not
couple
of
our
friends
heard
about
you
where
a
spaceman
was
getting
drunk
and
tipped
us
off
we
know
who
you
are
here
try
a
bracky
feldman
took
what
seemed
to
be
a
cigarette
and
studied
it
doubtfully
it
was
coarse
and
fibrous
inside
with
a
thin
hard
shell
that
seemed
to
be
a
natural
growth
as
if
it
had
been
chopped
from
some
vine
he
lighted
it
not
knowing
what
to
expect
then
he
coughed
as
the
bitter
rancid
smoke
burned
at
his
throat
he
started
to
throw
it
down
and
hesitated
jake
was
smoking
one
and
it
had
killed
the
craving
for
tobacco
almost
instantly
some
like
most
do
jake
said
they
wo
hurt
you
look
see
that
old
martian
ruins
built
by
some
race
a
million
years
ago
only
half
a
dozen
on
mars
it
was
only
a
clump
of
weathered
stone
buildings
in
the
light
from
the
tractor
and
feldman
had
seen
better
in
the
stereo
shots
it
was
interesting
only
because
it
connected
with
the
legendary
martian
race
like
the
canals
that
showed
from
space
but
could
not
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
feldman
waited
for
the
other
to
go
on
but
jake
was
silent
finally
he
ground
out
the
butt
of
the
weed
okay
jake
what
do
you
want
with
me
consultation
maybe
ever
hear
of
herb
doctors
i
one
of
them
feldman
knew
that
the
lobby
permitted
some
leniency
here
due
to
the
scarcity
of
real
medical
help
there
was
only
one
decent
hospital
at
northport
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
planet
jake
sighed
and
reached
for
another
bracky
weed
yeah
i
pretty
good
with
herbs
but
i
got
a
sick
village
on
my
hands
and
i
ca
handle
it
we
ca
all
mortgage
our
work
to
pay
for
a
trip
to
northport
southport
all
messed
up
while
the
new
gets
her
metabolism
changed
maybe
the
old
guy
there
would
have
helped
but
he
died
a
couple
months
ago
so
it
looks
like
you
our
only
hope
then
you
have
no
hope
feldman
told
him
sickly
i
a
pariah
jake
i
ca
do
a
thing
for
you
we
heard
about
your
argument
with
the
lobby
news
reaches
mars
but
these
are
mighty
sick
people
doc
feldman
shook
his
head
better
take
me
back
i
not
allowed
to
practice
medicine
the
charge
would
be
murder
if
anything
happened
lou
leaned
forward
shall
i
talk
to
him
jake
the
old
man
grimaced
time
enough
let
him
see
what
we
got
first
sand
howled
against
the
windshield
and
the
tractor
bumped
and
surged
along
feldman
took
another
of
the
weeds
and
tried
to
estimate
their
course
but
he
had
no
idea
where
they
were
when
the
tractor
finally
stopped
there
was
a
village
of
small
huts
that
seemed
to
be
merely
entrances
to
living
quarters
dug
under
the
surface
they
led
him
into
one
and
through
a
tunnel
into
a
large
room
filled
with
simple
cots
and
the
unhappy
sounds
of
sick
people
two
women
were
disconsolately
trying
to
attend
to
the
sick
four
children
and
two
adults
their
faces
brightened
as
they
saw
jake
then
fell
eb
and
tilda
died
they
reported
feldman
looked
at
the
two
figures
under
the
sheets
and
whistled
the
same
black
specks
he
had
seen
on
the
face
of
billings
covered
the
skins
of
the
two
old
people
who
had
died
funny
jake
said
slowly
they
did
quite
act
like
the
others
and
they
sure
died
mighty
fast
darn
it
i
had
it
figured
for
that
stuff
in
the
book
infantile
paralysis
how
about
it
doc
sort
of
like
a
cold
stiff
sore
neck
it
was
clearly
polio
one
of
the
diseases
that
could
attack
flesh
feldman
nodded
at
the
symptoms
staring
at
the
sick
kids
he
shrugged
finally
there
a
cure
for
it
but
i
do
have
the
serum
neither
do
you
or
you
would
have
brought
me
here
i
could
help
if
i
wanted
to
that
old
book
did
list
a
cure
jake
told
him
but
it
said
the
kids
did
have
to
be
crippled
there
was
something
about
a
kenny
treatment
doc
does
the
stuff
really
cripple
for
life
feldman
saw
one
of
the
boys
flinch
he
dropped
his
eyes
remembering
the
lobby
efficient
spy
service
on
earth
and
wondering
what
it
was
like
here
but
he
knew
the
outcome
damn
you
jake
jake
chuckled
thought
you
would
we
sure
appreciate
it
just
tell
us
what
to
do
doc
feldman
began
writing
down
his
requirements
trying
to
remember
the
details
of
the
treatment
exercise
hot
compresses
massage
it
was
coming
back
to
him
he
have
to
do
it
himself
of
course
to
get
the
feel
of
it
he
could
explain
it
well
enough
but
he
could
turn
his
back
on
the
kids
either
maybe
i
can
help
he
said
doubtfully
as
he
moved
toward
a
cot
no
doc
jake
voice
was
amused
any
longer
and
he
held
the
younger
man
back
you
doing
us
a
favor
and
i
be
darned
if
let
you
stick
your
neck
out
too
far
you
ca
treat
yourself
mars
is
tougher
than
earth
you
should
live
under
space
lobby
medical
lobby
here
a
while
oh
maybe
they
do
mind
a
few
fools
like
me
being
herb
doctors
but
they
sure
hate
to
have
a
man
who
can
do
real
medicine
outside
their
hands
you
let
me
do
it
or
get
in
the
tractor
and
i
have
lou
drive
you
back
once
you
start
in
here
there
be
no
stopping
believe
me
feldman
looked
at
him
seeing
the
colonials
around
him
for
the
first
time
as
people
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
he
been
treated
as
a
fellow
human
by
anyone
jake
was
right
he
knew
once
he
put
his
hand
to
the
bandage
eventually
there
be
no
turning
back
from
the
scalpel
these
people
needed
medical
help
too
desperately
eventually
the
news
would
spread
and
the
lobby
police
would
come
for
him
chris
could
afford
to
shield
him
in
fact
he
was
sure
now
that
she
hunt
him
night
and
day
do
be
a
fool
jake
he
ordered
brusquely
he
handed
his
list
to
one
of
the
women
you
have
to
learn
to
do
what
i
do
he
told
the
people
there
you
have
to
work
like
fools
for
weeks
but
there
wo
be
many
crippled
children
i
can
promise
that
much
he
blinked
sharply
at
the
sudden
hope
in
their
eyes
but
his
mind
went
on
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
inevitable
would
catch
up
with
him
with
luck
maybe
a
few
months
but
he
had
been
blessed
with
any
superabundance
of
luck
it
would
probably
be
less
time
than
he
thought
v
surgery
doc
feldman
luck
was
better
than
he
had
expected
for
an
earth
year
he
was
a
doctor
again
moving
about
from
village
to
village
as
he
was
needed
and
doing
what
he
could
the
village
had
been
isolated
during
the
early
colonization
when
mars
made
a
feeble
attempt
to
break
free
of
space
lobby
their
supplies
had
been
cut
off
and
they
had
been
forced
to
do
for
themselves
now
they
were
largely
they
grew
native
plants
and
extracted
hormones
in
crude
little
chemical
plants
the
hormones
were
traded
to
the
big
chemical
plants
for
a
pittance
to
buy
what
had
to
come
from
earth
other
affairs
synthesized
much
of
their
food
but
mostly
they
learned
to
get
along
on
what
mars
provided
doc
feldman
learned
from
them
money
was
no
longer
part
of
his
life
he
ate
with
whatever
family
needed
him
and
slipped
into
the
life
around
him
he
was
learning
martian
medicine
and
finding
that
his
earth
courses
were
mostly
useless
no
wonder
the
villagers
distrusted
lobby
doctors
doc
had
his
own
little
laboratory
where
he
had
managed
to
start
making
penicillin
a
primitive
antibiotic
but
better
than
nothing
jake
had
come
to
remind
him
that
it
was
his
first
anniversary
and
now
they
were
smoking
bracky
together
sheer
luck
jake
doc
repeated
you
martians
are
tough
but
some
day
someone
is
going
to
die
under
my
care
with
the
little
equipment
i
have
then
jake
nodded
slowly
maybe
doc
and
maybe
some
day
mars
will
break
free
of
the
lobbies
you
better
pray
for
that
i
been
doc
stopped
realizing
what
he
started
to
say
the
old
man
chuckled
you
been
talking
rebellion
for
months
doc
i
hear
rumors
whenever
you
get
mad
you
want
us
to
secede
but
you
do
really
mean
it
yet
you
ca
picture
any
government
but
the
one
you
used
to
doc
grinned
jake
had
a
point
but
it
was
not
as
strong
as
it
would
have
been
a
few
months
before
the
towns
under
the
lobby
were
cheap
imitations
of
earth
but
here
divorced
to
a
large
extent
from
the
lobbies
the
villages
were
making
mars
their
own
their
ways
might
be
strange
but
they
worked
jake
shifted
his
body
in
the
weak
sunlight
newton
village
forgot
to
report
a
death
on
time
i
hear
ryan
is
sweating
them
out
trying
to
prove
it
was
your
fault
there
was
no
evidence
against
him
yet
doc
was
sure
but
chris
was
out
to
prove
something
and
to
get
a
reputation
as
a
administrator
it
must
have
hurt
when
they
shipped
her
here
as
head
of
the
lesser
hemisphere
of
mars
she
expected
to
use
feldman
as
a
front
while
she
became
the
actual
ruler
of
the
whole
lobby
now
she
wanted
to
strike
back
she
using
blackmail
he
said
and
some
of
his
old
bitterness
was
in
his
voice
anyone
taking
treatment
from
an
herb
doctor
in
this
section
is
cut
off
from
medical
lobby
service
damn
it
jake
that
could
mean
letting
people
die
yeah
jake
sighed
softly
it
could
mean
letting
people
begin
to
think
about
getting
rid
of
the
lobby
too
well
i
got
ta
help
harvest
the
bracky
take
it
easy
on
operating
for
a
while
will
you
doc
all
right
jake
but
stop
keeping
the
serious
cases
a
secret
two
men
died
last
month
because
you
would
call
me
for
surgery
i
broken
all
my
oaths
already
it
does
matter
anymore
it
matters
boy
we
been
lucky
but
some
day
one
case
will
go
to
the
hospital
and
they
find
your
former
work
then
they
really
be
after
you
the
less
you
do
the
better
doc
watched
jake
slump
off
then
turned
down
into
the
little
root
cellar
and
back
toward
the
room
concealed
behind
it
where
his
crude
laboratory
lay
for
the
moment
he
was
free
to
work
on
the
mystery
of
the
black
spots
he
kept
running
into
them
always
on
the
body
of
someone
who
died
of
something
that
seemed
like
a
normal
disease
without
a
microscope
he
was
almost
helpless
but
he
had
taken
specimens
and
tried
to
culture
them
some
of
his
cultures
had
grown
though
they
might
be
nothing
but
unknown
martian
fungi
or
bacteria
mars
was
dry
and
almost
devoid
of
air
but
plants
and
a
few
smaller
insects
had
survived
and
adapted
it
was
by
any
means
lifeless
without
a
microscope
he
could
do
little
but
depend
on
his
files
of
cases
but
today
there
was
new
evidence
a
villager
had
filched
an
earth
from
the
tractor
driven
by
chris
ryan
and
forwarded
it
to
him
he
found
the
black
specks
mentioned
in
a
single
paragraph
under
skin
diseases
investigation
of
the
diet
was
being
made
since
all
cases
were
among
people
eating
synthetics
there
was
another
article
on
aberrant
cases
a
few
strange
little
misbehaviors
in
classical
syndromes
he
studied
that
wondering
it
had
to
be
the
same
thing
diet
did
account
for
the
fact
that
the
specks
appeared
only
when
the
patient
was
near
death
nor
did
it
account
for
the
hard
lump
at
the
base
of
the
neck
which
he
found
in
every
case
he
could
check
that
might
be
coincidence
but
he
doubted
it
whatever
it
was
it
aggravated
any
other
disease
the
patient
had
and
made
seemingly
simple
diseases
turn
out
to
be
completely
and
rapidly
fatal
once
syphilis
had
been
called
the
great
imitator
this
gave
promise
of
being
worse
he
shook
his
head
cursing
his
lack
of
equipment
each
month
more
people
were
dying
with
these
specks
and
he
was
helpless
the
concealed
door
broke
open
suddenly
and
a
boy
thrust
his
head
in
doc
there
a
man
here
from
einstein
says
his
wife
dying
the
man
was
already
coming
into
the
room
she
powerful
sick
doc
had
a
bellyache
fever
began
throwing
up
pains
under
her
belly
like
she
had
before
but
this
time
it
awful
doc
shot
a
few
questions
at
him
frowning
at
what
he
heard
then
he
began
packing
the
few
things
that
might
help
there
should
be
no
appendicitis
on
mars
the
bugs
responsible
for
that
should
have
adapted
to
but
more
and
more
infections
found
ways
to
cross
the
border
gangrene
had
been
able
to
get
by
without
change
it
seemed
so
far
none
of
the
contagious
infections
except
polio
and
the
common
cold
had
made
the
jump
this
sounded
like
an
advanced
case
perhaps
already
involving
peritonitis
so
far
he
been
lucky
with
penicillin
but
each
time
he
used
it
with
grave
doubts
of
its
action
on
the
patients
if
the
appendix
had
burst
however
it
was
the
only
possible
treatment
he
riffled
through
his
stores
there
was
ether
enough
fortunately
the
villagers
had
made
that
for
him
out
of
martian
plants
using
their
complicated
fermentation
processes
he
yelled
for
jake
and
the
boy
brought
the
old
man
back
a
moment
later
jake
i
need
more
of
that
narcotic
stuff
i
do
want
the
woman
writhing
and
tearing
her
stitches
after
the
ether
wears
off
ca
get
it
doc
jake
eyes
seemed
to
cloud
as
he
said
it
distilling
plant
broke
down
doc
i
do
like
this
case
that
been
to
the
hospital
three
times
i
hear
she
just
got
out
recently
this
might
be
a
plant
or
they
figure
they
ca
help
her
they
afraid
to
try
anything
on
flesh
they
ca
be
proved
wrong
if
they
do
nothing
doc
finished
packing
his
bag
and
got
ready
to
go
out
jake
either
i
a
doctor
or
i
not
i
ca
worry
when
a
woman
may
be
dying
for
a
second
jake
expression
was
stubborn
then
the
little
feet
around
his
eyes
deepened
and
the
dry
chuckle
was
back
in
his
voice
right
dr
feldman
he
flipped
up
his
thumb
and
went
off
at
a
shuffling
run
toward
the
tractor
lou
and
the
man
from
einstein
followed
doc
into
the
machine
it
was
a
silent
ride
except
for
doc
questions
about
the
sick
woman
her
husband
george
lynn
was
evasive
and
probably
ignorant
he
admitted
that
harriet
had
been
to
the
dispensary
and
small
infirmary
that
southport
called
a
hospital
it
was
the
only
place
in
the
entire
southern
hemisphere
where
an
operation
could
be
performed
legally
most
cases
had
to
go
to
northport
but
chris
had
been
trying
to
expand
apparently
she
was
determined
to
make
southport
into
another
major
center
before
she
was
called
back
to
earth
doc
wondered
why
the
villagers
went
there
they
had
no
medical
insurance
with
the
lobby
they
could
afford
it
most
villagers
did
have
the
cash
either
they
were
forced
to
mortgage
their
future
work
and
that
of
their
families
to
the
drug
plants
that
were
run
by
the
lobby
and
they
just
turned
your
wife
away
doc
asked
he
could
quite
believe
that
of
chris
well
i
dunno
she
would
talk
much
twice
she
went
and
they
gave
her
something
cost
every
cent
i
could
borrow
then
this
last
time
they
kept
her
a
couple
days
before
they
let
me
come
and
get
her
but
now
she
a
lot
worse
jake
spun
about
suddenly
tense
how
you
pay
them
last
time
george
why
they
did
ask
i
told
her
she
could
put
up
six
months
from
me
and
the
kids
but
nobody
said
nothing
about
it
just
gave
her
back
to
me
he
frowned
slowly
his
dull
voice
uncertain
they
told
me
done
all
they
could
not
to
bring
her
back
that
why
she
was
so
strong
on
getting
doc
i
do
like
it
jake
said
flatly
it
stinks
they
always
charge
george
did
they
suggest
she
get
in
touch
with
doc
here
maybe
they
did
maybe
not
harriet
did
all
the
talking
with
them
i
just
do
what
she
tells
me
and
she
said
to
get
doc
jake
swore
it
smells
like
a
trap
are
you
sure
she
sick
george
i
felt
her
head
and
she
sure
had
a
fever
george
lynn
was
torn
between
his
loyalties
you
know
me
doc
you
fixed
me
up
that
time
i
had
the
red
pip
i
would
pull
nothing
on
you
doc
had
a
feeling
that
jake
was
probably
right
but
he
vetoed
the
suggestion
that
they
stop
to
look
for
spies
he
had
no
time
for
that
if
the
woman
was
really
sick
he
had
to
get
to
her
at
once
and
even
that
might
be
too
late
he
remembered
the
woman
sickly
from
other
treatment
he
been
forced
to
remove
her
inflamed
tonsils
a
few
months
before
she
whined
and
complained
because
he
could
spend
all
his
time
attending
her
she
was
a
nag
a
shrew
and
a
totally
selfish
woman
but
that
was
her
worry
not
his
he
dashed
into
the
little
house
when
they
reached
einstein
and
his
first
glance
confirmed
what
george
lynn
had
said
the
woman
was
sick
all
right
she
was
running
a
high
fever
much
too
high
she
began
whining
and
protesting
at
his
having
taken
so
long
but
the
pain
soon
forced
her
to
stop
there
may
still
be
a
chance
doc
told
her
husband
brusquely
he
threw
the
cleanest
sheet
onto
a
table
and
shoved
it
under
the
single
light
keep
out
of
the
way
in
the
other
room
if
you
can
all
pile
in
there
this
is
exactly
aseptic
anyhow
you
can
boil
a
lot
of
water
if
you
want
to
help
it
would
give
them
something
to
do
and
he
could
use
the
water
to
clean
up
there
was
no
time
to
wait
for
it
however
he
had
to
sterilize
with
alcohol
and
carbolic
acid
and
hope
he
bent
over
the
woman
ripping
her
thin
gown
across
to
make
room
for
the
operation
then
he
swore
across
her
abdomen
was
the
unhealed
wound
of
a
previous
operation
they
worked
on
her
at
southport
they
must
have
removed
the
appendix
and
then
been
shocked
by
the
signs
of
infection
they
were
supposed
to
release
a
sick
patient
but
there
was
an
easy
out
for
them
they
could
remove
her
from
the
danger
of
spreading
an
unknown
infection
some
doctors
must
have
doped
her
up
on
sedatives
and
painkillers
and
sent
her
home
knowing
that
she
would
call
him
for
that
matter
they
might
have
noticed
her
unrecorded
tonsillectomy
and
considered
her
fair
bait
he
grabbed
the
ether
and
slapped
a
cone
over
her
nose
she
tried
to
protest
she
never
cooperated
in
anything
but
the
fumes
of
the
ether
he
dipped
onto
the
packing
of
the
cone
soon
overcame
that
it
was
peritonitis
of
course
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
go
in
and
scrape
and
clean
as
best
he
could
it
was
a
rotten
job
to
have
to
do
and
he
should
have
had
help
but
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
began
he
could
trust
anyone
else
to
hold
the
instruments
even
he
cleaned
the
infection
as
best
he
could
knowing
there
was
almost
no
chance
he
used
all
the
penicillin
he
dared
then
he
began
sewing
up
the
incision
it
was
all
he
could
do
except
for
dressing
the
wound
with
a
sterile
bandage
he
reached
for
one
and
stopped
while
he
been
working
the
woman
had
died
far
more
quietly
than
she
had
ever
lived
it
was
probably
the
only
gracious
act
of
her
life
but
it
was
damning
to
doc
they
could
hide
her
death
and
any
investigation
would
show
that
someone
had
worked
on
her
to
the
lobby
he
would
be
the
one
who
had
murdered
her
jake
was
waiting
in
the
tractor
he
took
one
look
at
doc
face
and
made
no
inquiries
they
were
more
than
a
mile
away
when
jake
pointed
back
small
in
the
distance
but
distinct
against
the
sands
a
gray
medical
corps
tractor
was
coming
either
they
had
a
spy
in
the
village
or
they
guessed
the
rate
of
her
infection
very
closely
they
must
have
hoped
to
catch
doc
in
the
act
and
they
barely
missed
it
would
matter
their
pictures
and
what
testimony
they
could
force
from
the
village
should
be
enough
to
hang
doc
vi
research
there
had
been
a
council
the
night
following
the
death
of
harriet
lynn
somehow
the
word
had
spread
through
the
villages
and
the
chiefs
had
assembled
in
jake
village
but
they
had
brought
no
solution
and
in
the
long
run
had
been
forced
to
accept
doc
decision
i
not
going
to
retire
and
hide
he
told
them
surprised
at
his
own
decision
but
grimly
determined
you
need
me
and
i
need
you
i
move
every
day
in
hopes
the
lobby
police
wo
find
me
but
i
wo
quit
now
he
was
packing
the
things
he
most
needed
and
getting
ready
to
move
the
small
bottles
in
which
he
was
trying
to
grow
his
cultures
would
need
warmth
he
shoved
them
into
an
inner
pocket
and
began
surveying
what
must
be
left
he
was
heading
for
his
tractor
when
another
battered
machine
drove
up
it
had
a
girl
of
about
fourteen
with
tears
streaming
down
her
face
she
held
out
a
pleading
hand
and
her
voice
was
scared
it
it
mama
where
leibnitz
leibnitz
was
near
enough
doc
started
his
tractor
motioning
for
the
girl
to
lead
the
way
the
little
dwelling
she
led
him
to
was
at
the
edge
of
the
village
looking
more
than
most
chris
ryan
and
three
of
the
medical
lobby
police
were
inside
waiting
the
girl
mother
was
tied
to
the
bed
with
a
collection
of
medical
instruments
laid
out
but
apparently
the
threat
had
been
enough
no
actual
injury
had
been
inflicted
probably
none
had
been
intended
seriously
i
knew
you
answer
that
kind
of
call
chris
said
coldly
he
grinned
sickly
they
wasted
no
time
i
hear
it
more
than
do
chris
congratulations
my
patient
died
you
lucky
she
was
certainly
dead
when
my
men
took
her
picture
the
print
shows
the
death
grimace
clearly
pretty
frame
it
and
keep
it
to
comfort
you
when
you
feel
lonely
he
snapped
she
struck
him
across
the
mouth
with
the
handle
of
her
gun
then
she
twisted
out
through
the
door
quickly
heading
for
the
tractor
that
had
been
camouflaged
to
look
like
those
used
by
the
villagers
the
three
police
led
him
behind
her
a
shout
went
up
and
people
began
to
rush
onto
the
village
street
but
they
were
too
late
by
the
time
they
reached
southport
doc
could
see
a
trail
of
battered
tractors
behind
but
there
was
nothing
more
the
people
could
do
chris
had
her
evidence
and
her
prisoner
judge
ben
wilson
might
have
been
jake
brother
he
was
older
and
grayer
but
the
same
expression
lay
on
his
face
he
must
have
been
the
family
black
sheep
since
his
father
had
been
president
of
space
lobby
instead
of
inheriting
the
position
wilson
had
remained
on
mars
safely
out
of
the
family
way
he
dropped
the
paper
he
was
reading
to
frown
at
chris
this
the
fellow
she
began
formal
charges
but
he
cut
them
off
your
lawyer
already
had
all
that
drawn
up
i
been
expecting
you
doctor
doctor
hnnf
do
a
lot
better
home
somewhere
raising
a
flock
of
babies
well
young
fellow
so
you
feldman
okay
your
trial
comes
up
day
after
tomorrow
be
a
shame
to
lock
you
in
southport
jail
a
man
of
your
importance
we
just
keep
you
here
in
the
room
it
a
lot
more
comfortable
chris
had
been
boiling
slowly
and
now
she
seemed
to
blow
her
safety
valve
judge
wilson
your
methods
are
your
own
business
in
local
affairs
but
this
involves
earth
medical
lobby
i
demand
tch
the
judge
stared
at
her
reprovingly
young
woman
you
do
demand
anything
this
is
mars
if
space
lobby
can
stand
me
i
guess
our
friends
over
at
medical
will
have
to
or
should
i
hold
trial
right
now
and
find
feldman
innocent
for
lack
of
evidence
you
would
chris
cried
then
her
face
sobered
suddenly
i
apologize
medical
is
pleased
to
leave
things
in
your
hands
of
course
wilson
smiled
court
closed
for
today
doc
i
show
you
your
cell
it
right
next
to
my
study
so
i
heading
there
anyhow
he
began
shucking
his
robe
while
chris
went
out
with
the
police
her
voice
sharp
and
continual
the
cell
was
both
reasonably
and
comfortable
doc
saw
and
he
tried
to
thank
the
judge
but
the
old
man
waved
it
aside
forget
it
i
just
like
to
see
that
little
termagant
taken
down
but
do
count
on
my
being
soft
my
methods
may
be
a
bit
unusual
i
always
did
like
the
courtroom
scenes
in
the
old
books
by
that
fellow
smith
but
space
lobby
never
had
any
reason
to
reverse
my
decisions
anything
you
need
sure
doc
told
him
grinning
in
spite
of
his
bitterness
a
good
biology
lab
and
an
electron
microscope
umm
how
about
a
good
optical
mike
and
some
stains
just
got
them
in
on
the
last
shipment
figure
they
were
meant
for
you
anyhow
since
jake
mullens
asked
me
to
order
them
he
went
out
and
came
back
with
the
box
almost
at
once
he
snorted
at
doc
incredulous
thanks
and
moved
off
his
bedroom
slippers
slapping
against
the
hard
floor
doc
stared
after
him
if
he
were
a
friend
of
jake
willing
to
invent
some
excuse
to
get
a
microscope
here
but
it
did
matter
friend
or
foe
his
death
sentence
would
be
equally
fatal
and
there
were
other
things
to
be
thought
of
now
the
little
microscope
was
an
excellent
one
though
only
a
monocular
doc
hands
trembled
as
he
drew
his
cultures
out
and
began
making
up
a
slide
the
sun
offered
the
best
source
of
light
near
the
window
and
he
adjusted
the
instrument
something
began
to
come
into
view
but
too
faintly
to
be
really
visible
he
remembered
the
stains
trying
to
recall
his
biology
courses
more
by
luck
than
skill
his
fourth
try
gave
him
results
under
two
thousand
powers
he
could
just
see
details
there
were
dozens
of
cells
in
his
impure
culture
but
only
one
seemed
unfamiliar
it
was
a
long
thing
sharpened
at
both
ends
with
the
three
separate
nuclei
that
were
typical
of
martian
life
forms
nearby
were
a
host
of
little
rodlike
squiggles
just
too
small
to
see
clearly
martian
life
no
martian
bug
had
ever
proved
harmful
to
men
yet
this
was
no
mutated
cell
or
virus
from
earth
it
was
a
new
disease
completely
different
from
all
others
it
was
one
where
all
centuries
of
experience
with
bacteria
would
be
valueless
the
first
martian
disease
unless
this
was
simply
some
accidental
contamination
of
his
culture
not
common
to
the
other
samples
he
worked
on
until
the
light
was
too
faint
before
putting
the
microscope
aside
by
the
time
the
trial
commenced
however
he
was
sure
of
the
cause
of
the
disease
it
martian
crude
as
his
cultures
were
they
had
proved
that
the
little
courtroom
was
filled
mostly
from
the
villages
lou
was
there
along
with
others
he
had
come
to
know
then
the
sight
of
jake
caught
doc
eyes
the
darned
fool
had
no
business
there
he
could
get
too
closely
mixed
into
the
whole
mess
court
in
session
wilson
announced
doc
you
represented
by
counsel
jake
voice
answered
your
honor
i
represent
the
defendant
i
think
you
find
my
credentials
in
order
chris
started
to
protest
but
wilson
grinned
never
lost
your
standing
in
spite
of
that
little
fracas
thirty
years
ago
so
far
as
i
know
but
the
police
thought
you
were
a
witness
when
you
came
walking
in
figured
you
were
giving
up
i
never
said
so
jake
answered
chris
was
squirming
angrily
but
the
florid
man
acting
as
counsel
for
medical
lobby
shook
his
head
bending
over
to
whisper
in
her
ear
he
straightened
no
objection
to
counsel
for
the
defense
we
recognize
his
credentials
you
a
fool
matthews
the
judge
told
him
jake
was
smarter
than
half
the
rest
of
legal
lobby
before
he
went
native
still
can
tie
your
tail
to
a
can
okay
let
start
things
i
too
old
to
dawdle
doc
lost
track
of
most
of
what
happened
this
was
totally
unlike
anything
on
earth
though
it
might
have
been
in
keeping
with
the
general
casualness
of
the
villages
maybe
the
ritualistic
routine
of
the
lobbies
was
driving
those
who
could
resist
to
the
opposite
extreme
chris
was
the
final
witness
matthews
drew
comment
of
feldman
former
crime
from
her
and
jake
made
no
protest
though
wilson
seemed
to
expect
one
then
she
began
sewing
his
shroud
there
was
a
fact
that
managed
to
emerge
without
slanting
though
technically
correct
jake
sat
quietly
smiling
faintly
and
making
no
protests
he
got
up
lazily
to
chris
ryan
when
daniel
feldman
was
examined
by
the
captain
of
the
after
arriving
at
mars
station
did
you
identify
him
then
as
having
been
daniel
feldman
she
glanced
at
matthews
who
seemed
puzzled
but
unconcerned
correct
she
admitted
but
and
you
later
saw
him
delivered
to
the
surface
of
mars
is
that
also
correct
when
she
assented
jake
hesitated
then
he
frowned
what
did
you
do
then
did
you
report
him
or
send
anyone
to
look
after
him
or
anything
like
that
certainly
not
she
answered
he
was
no
you
did
absolutely
nothing
about
him
after
you
identified
him
and
saw
him
delivered
here
you
quite
sure
of
that
i
did
nothing
jake
stood
quietly
for
a
moment
then
shrugged
no
more
questions
matthews
finished
things
in
a
plea
for
the
salvation
of
all
humanity
from
the
danger
of
such
men
as
daniel
feldman
he
was
looking
smug
as
was
chris
wilson
turned
to
jake
has
the
defense
anything
to
say
a
few
things
your
honor
jake
stood
up
suddenly
looking
certain
and
pleased
we
are
happy
to
admit
everything
factual
the
lobby
had
testified
daniel
feldman
performed
a
surgical
operation
on
harriet
lynn
in
the
village
of
einstein
but
when
has
it
been
illegal
for
a
member
of
the
medical
profession
to
perform
an
operation
even
with
small
chance
of
success
within
an
accepted
area
for
such
operation
there
has
been
no
evidence
adduced
that
any
crime
or
act
of
even
unethical
conduct
was
committed
that
brought
chris
and
matthews
to
their
feet
wilson
was
relaxed
again
looking
as
if
he
swallowed
a
whole
cage
of
canaries
he
banged
his
gavel
down
jake
picked
up
two
ragged
and
volumes
from
his
table
case
of
harding
southport
establishes
that
a
lobby
is
responsible
for
any
member
on
mars
it
is
also
responsible
for
informing
the
authorities
of
any
criminal
conduct
on
the
part
of
its
members
or
any
former
member
known
to
it
failure
to
report
shall
be
considered
an
admission
that
the
lobby
recognizes
the
member
as
one
in
good
standing
and
accepts
responsibility
for
that
member
conduct
at
the
time
daniel
feldman
arrived
christina
ryan
was
the
highest
appointed
representative
of
medical
lobby
in
southport
with
full
authority
she
identified
feldman
as
having
been
a
doctor
without
stipulating
any
change
in
status
she
made
no
further
report
to
any
authority
concerning
daniel
feldman
presence
here
it
seems
obvious
that
medical
lobby
at
southport
thereby
accepted
daniel
feldman
as
a
doctor
in
good
standing
for
whose
conduct
the
lobby
accepted
full
responsibility
wilson
studied
the
book
jake
held
out
and
nodded
seems
pretty
to
me
he
agreed
passing
the
book
on
to
matthews
still
the
charge
that
feldman
operated
outside
a
hospital
no
reason
he
should
jake
said
he
handed
over
the
other
volume
this
is
the
charter
for
medical
lobby
on
mars
medical
lobby
agrees
to
perform
all
necessary
surgical
and
medical
services
for
the
planet
though
at
the
signing
of
this
charter
there
was
no
hospital
on
mars
necessarily
medical
lobby
agreed
to
perform
surgery
outside
of
any
hospital
then
but
to
make
it
plainer
there
a
later
paragraph
page
that
defines
each
hospital
zone
as
extending
not
less
than
three
nor
more
than
one
hundred
miles
einstein
is
about
one
hundred
and
ten
miles
from
the
nearest
hospital
at
southport
so
einstein
comes
under
the
original
charter
provisions
feldman
was
forced
by
charter
provisions
to
protect
the
good
name
of
his
lobby
by
undertaking
any
necessary
surgery
in
einstein
he
waited
until
matthews
had
scanned
that
book
then
took
it
back
and
began
packing
a
big
bag
doc
saw
that
his
possessions
and
the
microscope
were
already
in
the
bag
the
old
man
paid
no
attention
to
the
arguments
of
matthews
before
the
bench
abruptly
wilson
pounded
his
gavel
this
court
finds
that
daniel
feldman
is
qualified
to
practice
all
the
arts
and
skills
of
the
medical
profession
on
mars
and
that
he
acted
ethically
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
in
the
case
of
the
deceased
harriet
lynn
he
ruled
the
costs
of
the
case
shall
be
billed
to
medical
lobby
of
southport
he
took
off
his
robe
and
moved
rapidly
toward
his
private
quarters
court
was
closed
doc
got
up
shakily
not
daring
to
believe
fully
what
he
had
heard
he
started
toward
jake
trying
to
avoid
bumping
into
chris
but
she
would
not
be
avoided
she
stood
in
front
of
him
screaming
accusations
and
threats
that
reminded
him
of
the
only
fight
they
ever
had
during
their
brief
marriage
when
she
ran
down
he
finally
met
her
eyes
you
a
helluva
doctor
he
told
her
harshly
you
spend
all
your
time
fighting
me
when
there
a
plague
out
there
that
may
be
worse
than
any
disease
we
ever
known
take
a
look
at
what
lies
under
the
black
specks
on
your
corpses
find
the
first
martian
disease
and
maybe
if
you
begin
working
on
that
now
you
can
learn
to
be
a
real
doctor
in
time
to
do
something
about
it
but
i
doubt
it
she
fell
back
from
him
then
research
you
been
doing
unauthorized
research
prove
it
he
suggested
but
you
be
a
lot
smarter
to
try
some
yourself
and
to
hell
with
your
precious
rules
he
followed
jake
out
to
the
tractor
surprisingly
the
old
man
was
sweating
now
he
shook
his
head
at
look
and
his
grin
was
uncertain
matthews
is
an
incompetent
he
said
they
could
have
had
you
doc
that
charter
is
so
sloppy
a
man
can
prove
anything
by
it
and
building
a
hospital
here
did
bring
in
earth
rules
wilson
went
out
on
a
limb
in
letting
you
go
but
i
guess
we
got
away
with
it
let
get
out
of
here
doc
climbed
into
the
tractor
more
soberly
they
had
escaped
this
time
but
there
would
be
another
time
and
he
was
pretty
sure
that
would
be
chris
round
he
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
his
research
vii
plague
feldman
leaned
back
from
his
microscope
and
lighted
another
bracky
weed
he
glanced
about
the
room
and
sighed
wearily
maybe
he
been
better
off
when
he
had
no
friends
and
could
risk
the
safety
of
others
in
an
effort
to
do
research
that
was
the
highest
crime
on
two
worlds
the
evidence
of
his
work
was
hidden
thirty
feet
beyond
his
former
laboratory
in
jake
village
with
a
tunnel
that
led
from
another
the
theory
was
the
old
one
that
the
best
place
to
avoid
discovery
was
where
you
had
already
been
discovered
if
their
spies
had
identified
his
former
hangout
they
never
expect
to
have
him
set
up
research
nearby
it
was
a
nice
theory
but
he
was
sure
of
it
jake
looked
up
from
a
cot
where
he
been
watching
the
improvised
culture
incubator
stop
tearing
yourself
to
bits
doc
we
know
the
danger
and
we
still
darned
glad
to
have
you
here
working
on
this
i
trying
to
put
myself
together
into
a
whole
man
doc
told
him
but
i
seem
to
come
out
wholly
a
fool
yeah
sure
sometimes
it
takes
a
fool
to
get
things
done
wise
men
wait
too
long
for
the
right
time
how
the
bug
hunt
doc
grunted
in
disgust
and
swung
back
to
the
microscope
then
he
gave
up
as
his
tired
eyes
refused
to
focus
why
do
you
people
revolt
they
tried
it
twice
but
they
were
just
a
bunch
of
pariahs
shipped
here
to
live
in
peonage
they
could
do
much
the
first
time
earth
cut
off
shipments
and
starved
them
next
time
the
villages
had
the
answer
to
that
but
the
cities
had
to
fight
for
earth
or
starve
so
they
whipped
us
and
there
always
the
threat
that
earth
could
send
over
unmanned
war
rockets
loaded
with
fissionables
so
it
hopeless
so
nothing
the
lobbies
are
poisoning
themselves
like
cutting
off
medical
service
until
they
cut
themselves
out
of
a
job
it
just
a
matter
of
time
go
back
to
the
bugs
doc
doc
sighed
and
reached
for
his
notes
i
wish
i
knew
more
martian
history
i
been
wondering
whether
this
bug
may
not
have
been
what
killed
off
the
old
martians
something
had
to
do
it
the
way
they
disappeared
i
wish
i
knew
enough
to
make
an
investigation
of
those
ruins
out
there
durwood
jake
had
propped
himself
on
an
elbow
staring
at
doc
in
surprise
doc
scowled
clive
durwood
you
mean
the
archeologist
who
dug
up
what
little
we
know
about
the
ruins
yeah
before
he
went
back
to
earth
and
started
living
off
his
lectures
he
came
here
again
three
years
ago
and
dropped
dead
in
edison
on
the
way
to
some
other
ruins
heart
failure
they
called
it
though
it
was
more
like
the
two
old
farmers
who
ran
themselves
to
death
last
month
i
saw
him
when
they
buried
him
his
face
looked
funny
and
i
think
he
had
those
little
specks
though
i
may
remember
wrong
he
grimaced
mars
is
tough
doc
it
has
to
be
some
of
the
plant
seeds
durwood
found
in
the
ruins
grew
maybe
your
bugs
waited
a
million
years
till
we
came
along
what
about
the
farmers
did
they
meet
durwood
jake
nodded
must
have
he
lived
in
their
village
most
of
the
time
doc
went
through
his
notes
he
asked
for
reports
on
all
deaths
and
he
finally
found
the
account
the
two
old
men
had
been
nervous
and
fidgety
for
weeks
they
were
twins
living
by
themselves
and
nobody
paid
much
attention
then
one
morning
both
were
seen
running
wildly
in
circles
the
village
managed
to
tie
them
up
but
they
died
of
exhaustion
shortly
after
it
was
a
pretty
picture
the
disease
might
have
an
incubation
period
of
nearly
fifteen
years
judging
by
the
length
of
time
it
had
taken
to
hit
durwood
it
must
spread
from
person
to
person
during
an
early
contagious
stage
leaving
widening
circles
behind
durwood
and
those
first
infected
when
matured
any
other
sickness
would
set
it
off
with
few
symptoms
of
its
own
but
without
help
it
still
killed
its
victims
apparently
driving
them
madly
toward
frenzied
physical
effort
he
studied
the
culture
on
a
slide
again
he
tried
koch
method
to
get
a
pure
strain
splattering
the
bugs
onto
a
native
starchy
root
and
plucking
off
individual
colonies
about
twenty
specimens
had
been
treated
with
every
chemical
he
could
find
so
far
he
found
a
few
things
that
seemed
to
stop
their
growth
but
nothing
that
killed
them
except
stuff
far
too
harsh
to
use
in
living
tissue
he
had
nearly
forty
cases
of
deaths
that
showed
symptoms
now
and
he
went
back
over
them
looking
for
anything
in
common
that
went
back
ten
to
twenty
years
before
death
there
were
no
rashes
nor
blisters
a
few
had
had
apparent
colds
but
such
were
too
common
to
mean
anything
only
one
thing
appeared
about
fourteen
years
before
their
deaths
the
people
interviewed
about
the
victims
might
be
vague
about
most
things
but
they
remembered
the
time
when
jim
had
the
jumping
headache
jake
doc
called
what
jumping
headache
most
people
seem
to
have
it
some
time
or
other
but
i
have
run
across
a
case
of
it
sure
you
have
doc
mamie
brander
little
girl
a
few
weeks
ago
feels
like
your
pulse
is
going
to
rip
your
skull
off
right
here
ca
eat
because
chewing
drives
you
crazy
back
of
your
head
neck
and
shoulders
swell
up
for
about
a
week
then
it
goes
away
then
it
goes
away
for
fourteen
years
until
it
comes
back
to
kill
doc
stared
at
his
charts
in
sudden
horror
it
was
a
new
disease
thought
to
be
some
virus
but
not
considered
dangerous
selznik
migraine
according
to
medical
usage
you
treated
it
with
hot
pads
and
anodyne
and
it
went
away
easily
enough
he
seen
hundreds
of
such
cases
on
earth
there
must
be
millions
who
had
been
hit
by
it
the
branch
of
the
lobby
had
even
brought
out
something
called
nograine
to
use
for
something
important
jake
wanted
to
know
feldman
nodded
how
much
weight
do
you
swing
in
other
villages
jake
people
sort
of
do
me
favors
when
i
ask
jake
admitted
like
swiping
those
medical
journals
from
northport
for
you
or
like
molly
badger
getting
that
job
as
maid
to
spy
on
chris
ryan
name
it
and
i
do
my
best
doc
had
a
vague
idea
of
village
politics
but
he
had
more
important
things
to
think
of
most
of
his
foul
mood
had
disappeared
with
the
clue
he
stumbled
on
and
his
chief
worry
now
was
to
clinch
the
facts
feldman
considered
the
problem
i
want
a
report
on
every
case
of
jumping
headache
in
every
village
who
had
it
when
and
how
old
they
were
this
place
first
but
every
village
you
can
reach
and
i
want
someone
to
take
a
letter
to
chris
ryan
jake
frowned
at
that
but
went
out
to
issue
instructions
doc
sat
down
at
a
battered
old
typewriter
writing
chris
might
do
no
good
but
some
warning
had
to
be
gotten
through
to
earth
where
the
vast
resources
of
medical
lobby
could
be
thrown
into
the
task
of
finding
the
cause
and
cure
of
the
disease
the
connection
with
selznik
migraine
had
to
be
reported
if
something
could
blast
the
lobby
into
action
it
matter
quite
so
much
what
they
did
to
him
he
was
foolish
enough
to
expect
gratitude
from
them
but
he
was
getting
used
to
the
idea
that
his
days
were
numbered
the
plague
was
more
important
than
what
happened
to
him
the
letter
had
been
dispatched
by
the
time
jake
returned
here
the
dope
for
this
village
everybody
accounted
for
except
you
never
had
it
jake
feldman
went
down
the
list
most
of
it
fourteen
years
ago
that
fits
about
the
only
exceptions
are
the
kids
who
seem
to
get
it
between
the
ages
of
two
and
three
out
of
he
stared
at
the
figures
sickly
most
of
the
village
not
only
had
the
plague
but
must
be
near
the
end
of
the
incubation
period
it
looked
as
if
most
of
the
village
would
be
dead
before
another
year
passed
bad
jake
asked
the
first
symptom
of
martian
fever
the
old
man
whistled
the
lines
around
his
eyes
tightening
must
be
me
he
decided
i
the
guy
who
must
have
brought
it
here
then
i
used
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
with
durwood
at
his
diggings
there
was
a
constant
commotion
all
that
day
and
the
next
as
runners
went
out
to
the
villages
and
came
back
with
reports
the
variation
from
village
to
village
was
only
slight
most
of
mars
seemed
to
have
advanced
cases
of
martian
fever
without
animals
for
investigation
and
study
real
research
was
difficult
doc
also
needed
an
electron
microscope
he
was
reasonably
sure
that
the
disease
must
travel
through
the
nerves
but
he
had
found
no
proof
beyond
the
hard
lump
at
the
base
of
the
neck
there
it
was
a
organism
elsewhere
he
could
find
nothing
until
the
black
specks
developed
his
eyes
ached
from
trying
to
see
more
than
was
visible
in
the
microscope
the
tantalizing
suggestions
of
filaments
around
the
nuclei
might
be
the
form
of
plague
that
was
contagious
they
might
even
be
the
true
form
of
the
bug
with
the
bigger
cell
only
a
transition
stage
there
were
a
number
of
diseases
that
involved
complicated
changes
in
the
organisms
that
caused
them
but
he
could
be
sure
he
finally
buried
his
head
in
his
hands
trying
to
do
by
pure
thought
what
he
could
do
in
any
other
way
and
even
there
he
lacked
training
he
was
a
doctor
not
a
xenobiologist
research
training
had
been
taboo
in
school
except
for
a
favored
few
the
reports
continued
to
come
in
confirming
the
danger
they
seemed
to
have
the
worst
plague
on
their
hands
in
all
human
history
and
nobody
who
could
do
anything
about
it
even
knew
of
it
molly
reports
that
your
letter
got
some
results
jake
reported
chris
ryan
brought
home
one
of
the
electron
microscopes
and
a
bunch
of
equipment
from
the
hospital
pathology
room
think
she
get
anywhere
doc
doubted
it
damn
it
he
had
meant
for
her
to
try
it
though
she
might
have
authority
for
routine
experiments
but
it
was
like
her
to
refuse
to
pass
on
the
word
without
trying
to
prove
her
own
suspicion
of
him
first
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
the
fact
that
some
men
were
immune
or
seemed
so
about
three
out
of
a
hundred
showed
no
signs
if
that
immunity
was
hereditary
it
might
save
the
race
if
not
jake
came
in
at
twilight
with
a
grim
face
more
news
from
molly
the
lobby
is
starting
out
to
comb
every
village
with
a
starting
here
and
this
hole
will
show
up
like
a
sore
thumb
better
start
packing
we
got
ta
be
out
of
here
in
less
than
an
hour
viii
fool
three
days
later
doc
saw
his
first
runner
the
tractor
was
churning
through
the
sand
just
before
sundown
heading
toward
another
stand
at
a
new
village
lou
was
driving
while
doc
and
jake
brooded
silently
in
the
back
paying
no
attention
to
the
colors
that
were
blazoned
over
the
dunes
the
game
was
getting
to
doc
there
was
no
real
assurance
that
the
village
they
were
approaching
might
not
be
the
target
the
lobby
had
chosen
for
the
next
investigation
lou
braked
the
tractor
to
a
sudden
halt
and
pointed
a
figure
was
running
frantically
over
one
of
the
low
dunes
with
the
little
red
sun
behind
him
he
seemed
headed
toward
them
but
as
he
drew
nearer
they
could
see
that
he
had
no
definite
direction
he
simply
ran
pumping
his
legs
frantically
as
if
all
the
devils
of
hell
were
after
him
his
body
swayed
from
side
to
side
in
exhaustion
but
his
arms
and
legs
pumped
on
stop
him
jake
ordered
and
lou
swung
the
tractor
it
halted
squarely
in
the
runner
path
and
the
figure
struck
against
it
and
toppled
the
legs
went
on
pumping
digging
into
the
dirt
and
gravel
but
the
man
was
too
far
gone
to
rise
jake
and
lou
shoved
him
through
the
doors
into
the
tractor
and
doc
yanked
off
his
aspirator
the
man
was
giving
vent
to
a
kind
of
ululating
cry
weakened
now
almost
to
a
whine
that
rose
and
fell
with
the
motion
of
his
legs
sweat
had
once
streaked
his
haggard
face
but
it
was
dry
and
blanched
to
a
pasty
gray
doc
injected
enough
narcotic
to
quiet
a
maddened
bull
it
had
no
effect
except
to
upset
the
rhythm
of
the
arms
and
legs
it
took
five
more
minutes
for
the
man
to
die
the
specks
were
larger
this
time
the
size
of
periods
in
type
the
lump
at
the
base
of
the
skull
was
as
big
as
a
small
hen
egg
from
edison
like
the
others
so
far
jack
kooley
jake
answered
question
durwood
spent
a
lot
of
time
here
on
his
first
expedition
so
it
getting
the
worst
of
it
doc
pulled
the
aspirator
mask
back
over
the
man
face
and
they
carried
him
out
and
laid
him
on
a
low
dune
they
could
risk
returning
the
corpse
to
its
people
this
was
only
the
primary
circle
of
infection
direct
from
durwood
the
second
circle
could
be
ten
times
as
large
as
the
infection
spread
from
one
to
a
few
to
many
so
far
it
was
localized
but
it
would
stay
that
way
doc
climbed
slowly
out
of
the
tractor
lugging
his
small
supplies
of
equipment
while
jake
made
arrangements
for
them
to
spend
the
night
in
a
deserted
house
but
the
figure
of
the
runner
and
his
own
failures
to
find
more
about
the
disease
kept
haunting
doc
he
began
setting
up
his
equipment
grimly
better
get
some
sleep
jake
suggested
you
a
mite
more
tired
than
you
think
anyhow
i
thought
you
told
me
you
could
do
any
more
with
what
you
got
feldman
looked
at
the
supplies
he
had
spread
out
and
shook
his
head
wearily
he
been
over
every
chemical
and
combination
a
dozen
times
without
results
that
showed
in
the
limited
magnification
of
the
optical
mike
he
snapped
the
case
shut
and
hit
the
rude
table
with
the
heel
of
his
hand
there
are
other
supplies
jake
do
you
have
any
signal
to
get
in
touch
with
molly
at
the
ryan
house
three
raps
on
the
rear
left
window
i
get
lou
no
doc
came
to
his
feet
reaching
for
his
jacket
they
looking
for
three
men
now
it
safer
if
i
go
alone
and
i
the
only
one
who
knows
what
supplies
are
needed
with
luck
i
may
even
get
the
electron
mike
got
a
gun
i
can
borrow
jake
found
one
somewhere
an
old
revolver
with
a
few
loads
he
began
protesting
but
doc
overruled
him
sharply
three
men
could
no
more
fight
off
the
police
than
one
if
they
were
spotted
he
swung
toward
the
tractor
you
better
start
spreading
the
word
on
everything
we
know
if
people
realize
they
already
safe
or
doomed
it
be
better
than
having
them
going
crazy
to
avoid
contagion
most
of
the
villages
know
already
jake
told
him
and
damn
it
get
back
here
doc
if
you
ca
make
it
turn
tail
quick
and
we
think
of
something
else
southport
seemed
normal
enough
as
doc
drove
through
its
streets
the
stereo
house
was
open
and
the
little
shops
were
brightly
lighted
he
stopped
once
to
pull
a
copy
of
southport
little
newspaper
from
a
dispenser
all
was
quiet
on
its
front
page
too
as
usual
though
the
facts
were
buried
inside
the
editorial
was
pouring
too
much
oil
on
the
waters
in
its
lauding
of
the
role
of
medical
lobby
on
mars
for
no
apparent
reason
the
death
notices
no
longer
listed
the
cause
of
death
medical
knew
something
was
up
at
least
and
was
worried
he
parked
the
tractor
behind
chris
house
and
slipped
to
the
proper
window
everything
was
seemingly
quiet
there
at
his
knock
the
shade
was
drawn
back
and
he
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
molly
looking
out
a
moment
later
she
opened
the
rear
lock
to
let
him
into
the
kitchen
shh
she
still
up
i
think
what
can
i
do
doc
he
tried
to
smile
at
her
hide
me
until
it
safe
to
get
into
her
laboratory
i
got
to
the
inner
kitchen
was
kicked
open
and
chris
stood
beyond
it
holding
a
cocked
gun
in
her
hand
it
took
longer
than
i
expected
dan
she
said
quietly
but
after
your
letter
i
knew
you
swallow
the
bait
you
bloody
fool
did
you
really
believe
i
start
doing
research
here
just
because
of
your
imaginings
he
slumped
slowly
back
against
the
sink
so
this
is
a
fool
errand
then
there
never
was
any
equipment
here
the
equipment
here
in
my
office
i
guessed
your
spies
would
report
it
so
it
had
to
be
here
but
it
wo
help
you
now
pariah
feldman
he
came
from
his
braced
position
against
the
sink
like
a
spring
uncoiling
he
expected
her
to
shoot
but
hoped
the
surprise
would
ruin
her
aim
then
it
was
too
late
and
his
boot
hit
the
gun
savagely
knocking
it
from
her
hand
life
in
the
villages
had
hardened
him
surprisingly
she
was
comparatively
helpless
in
his
hands
a
few
minutes
later
he
had
her
bound
securely
with
surgical
tape
molly
brought
him
she
raged
furiously
in
the
chair
where
he
dumped
her
then
gave
up
they
get
you
daniel
feldman
surprisingly
there
was
no
rage
in
her
voice
now
you
wo
get
away
from
us
the
planet
is
big
enough
i
got
away
from
your
trial
he
reminded
her
and
i
got
away
and
lived
when
you
left
me
without
a
chance
on
the
ground
of
the
spaceport
she
laughed
harshly
got
away
then
you
fool
who
do
you
think
gave
you
the
extra
battery
so
you
could
live
long
enough
to
be
helped
at
the
spaceport
who
hired
a
fool
like
matthews
so
you
would
get
the
death
sentence
you
deserved
who
let
you
get
away
as
an
herb
doctor
for
months
before
you
set
yourself
up
as
god
and
a
traitor
to
mankind
again
it
shook
him
as
it
was
probably
intended
to
do
how
had
she
known
about
the
extra
battery
he
always
assumed
that
ben
had
returned
to
give
it
to
him
but
in
that
case
chris
could
know
of
it
then
he
hardened
himself
again
in
the
old
days
she
always
had
one
trump
card
he
could
beat
and
had
expected
but
too
much
was
involved
for
games
now
any
police
around
molly
he
asked
molly
came
back
a
minute
later
to
report
that
everything
looked
clear
and
to
show
him
where
the
equipment
had
been
set
up
in
chris
office
it
was
all
there
including
the
electron
mike
a
beautiful
little
portable
model
there
was
even
a
small
incubator
with
its
own
heat
source
into
which
he
immediately
transferred
the
little
bottles
he
been
keeping
warm
against
his
skin
most
of
the
equipment
had
never
been
unpacked
which
made
loading
it
onto
his
tractor
ridiculously
easy
better
come
with
me
now
molly
he
suggested
at
last
then
he
turned
to
chris
who
was
watching
him
with
almost
no
expression
you
can
wriggle
your
chair
to
the
phone
in
half
an
hour
i
guess
knock
the
phone
off
and
yell
for
help
it
better
than
you
deserve
unless
you
really
did
leave
me
that
battery
you
wo
get
away
with
it
she
told
him
again
calmly
this
time
no
he
admitted
probably
not
but
maybe
the
human
race
will
if
i
have
time
to
find
an
answer
to
the
plague
you
wo
see
under
your
nose
but
you
wo
get
away
with
it
either
in
the
long
run
your
kind
never
do
molly
was
sniffling
as
they
drove
away
it
had
probably
been
the
best
life
she
known
doc
supposed
chris
could
be
kind
to
menials
but
now
molly
work
was
done
and
she
have
to
disappear
into
the
villages
he
let
her
off
at
the
first
village
and
drove
on
alone
he
was
itching
to
get
to
the
microscope
now
hardly
able
to
wait
through
the
long
journey
back
to
jake
his
impatience
grew
with
each
mile
finally
he
gave
up
he
swung
the
tractor
into
a
small
gulley
between
sand
dunes
left
the
motor
idling
and
pulled
down
the
shades
the
villagers
used
for
blackout
traveling
there
was
power
enough
for
the
mike
here
and
the
cab
was
big
enough
for
what
he
had
to
do
he
mounted
the
mike
on
the
tractor
seat
and
began
laying
out
the
collection
of
smears
and
cultures
he
had
brought
it
had
been
years
since
he
made
a
film
for
the
electron
mike
but
he
found
it
all
came
back
to
him
as
he
worked
his
hands
were
sweating
with
tension
as
he
inserted
the
first
film
into
the
chamber
he
had
the
magnetic
lenses
set
for
twenty
thousand
power
but
a
quick
glance
showed
it
was
too
weak
he
raised
the
power
to
fifty
thousand
the
filaments
were
there
clear
and
distinct
he
turned
on
the
little
tape
recorder
that
had
been
part
of
equipment
and
set
the
microphone
where
he
could
dictate
into
it
without
stopping
to
make
clumsy
notes
he
readjusted
the
focus
carefully
carrying
on
a
running
commentary
then
he
gasped
each
of
the
little
filaments
carried
three
tiny
darker
sections
each
was
a
cell
complete
in
itself
with
the
typical
martian
triple
nucleus
he
put
a
film
with
a
tiny
section
of
the
nerve
tissue
from
a
corpse
into
the
chamber
next
and
again
a
quick
glance
at
the
screen
was
enough
the
filaments
were
there
thickly
crowded
among
nerve
cells
they
travel
along
the
nerves
to
reach
the
base
of
the
brain
before
the
larger
lump
could
form
a
specimen
from
one
of
the
black
specks
was
even
more
interesting
the
filaments
were
there
but
some
were
changed
or
changing
into
tiny
round
cells
also
with
the
triple
dark
spots
of
nuclei
those
must
be
the
final
form
that
was
released
to
infect
others
probably
at
first
these
multiplied
directly
in
epithelial
tissue
so
that
there
was
a
rapid
contagion
of
infection
eventually
they
must
form
the
filaments
that
invaded
the
nerves
and
caused
the
brief
bodily
reaction
that
was
selznik
migraine
then
the
body
adapted
to
them
and
they
began
to
incubate
slowly
developing
into
the
large
cells
he
had
first
seen
when
ripe
the
big
cells
broke
apart
into
millions
of
the
tiny
round
ones
that
went
back
to
the
nerve
endings
causing
the
black
spots
and
killing
the
host
he
knew
his
enemy
now
at
least
he
reached
for
the
controls
increasing
the
magnification
he
would
lose
resolution
but
he
might
find
something
more
at
the
extreme
limits
of
the
mike
something
wet
and
cold
gushed
into
his
face
he
jerked
back
trying
to
wipe
it
off
but
it
was
already
evaporating
and
there
was
a
thick
acrid
odor
in
the
cab
he
grabbed
for
his
aspirator
then
tried
to
reach
the
airlock
but
paralysis
was
already
spreading
through
him
and
he
toppled
to
the
floor
before
he
could
escape
when
he
came
to
it
was
morning
outside
and
chris
was
waiting
inside
the
cab
with
two
big
lobby
policemen
a
hypo
in
her
hand
must
have
been
what
revived
him
she
touched
the
electron
microscope
with
something
like
affection
the
lobby
technicians
did
a
good
job
on
this
do
you
think
dan
i
warned
you
but
you
would
listen
and
now
we
even
got
your
own
taped
words
to
prove
you
were
doing
forbidden
research
fool
she
shook
her
head
pityingly
as
the
tractor
began
moving
with
two
others
toward
southport
you
and
your
phony
diseases
a
little
skin
disorder
migraine
and
a
few
cases
of
psychosis
to
make
a
new
disease
do
you
think
medical
lobby
ca
check
on
such
simple
things
or
did
you
expect
us
to
hear
of
your
open
talk
of
revolt
and
realize
you
were
planning
to
create
some
new
germ
to
wipe
out
the
earth
forces
maybe
those
runners
of
yours
were
real
mass
murderer
she
drew
out
another
hypo
and
shoved
the
needle
into
his
arm
necrosynth
enough
to
keep
him
unconscious
for
hours
he
started
to
curse
her
but
the
drug
acted
before
he
could
complete
the
thought
ix
judgment
doc
woke
to
see
sunlight
shining
through
a
heavily
barred
window
that
must
be
in
the
official
southport
jail
he
waited
a
few
minutes
for
his
head
to
clear
and
then
sat
up
necrosynth
left
no
hangover
at
least
the
sound
of
steps
outside
was
followed
by
the
squeak
of
a
key
in
the
lock
fifteen
minutes
judge
wilson
a
voice
said
thank
you
officer
wilson
came
into
the
cell
carrying
a
tray
of
breakfast
and
a
copy
of
the
northport
he
began
unloading
bracky
weeds
from
his
pocket
while
doc
attacked
the
breakfast
they
tossed
the
book
at
you
doc
he
said
you
have
got
a
chance
and
there
nothing
the
villages
can
do
trial
set
for
tomorrow
at
northport
and
it
in
closed
session
we
ca
get
you
off
this
time
doc
nodded
thanks
for
coming
even
if
there
nothing
you
can
do
been
living
on
borrowed
time
for
a
year
anyhow
so
i
have
no
right
to
kick
but
who
the
villages
i
been
part
of
their
organization
for
years
the
old
man
sighed
heavily
you
might
say
a
revolution
has
been
going
on
since
i
can
remember
though
most
villagers
do
know
it
we
just
been
waiting
our
time
now
we
stopped
waiting
and
the
rifles
will
be
coming
out
rifles
made
in
village
shops
the
villages
are
going
to
rebel
even
if
we
all
dead
of
plague
in
a
month
doc
feldman
nodded
and
reached
for
the
bracky
he
knew
that
this
was
their
way
of
trying
to
make
him
feel
his
work
had
been
for
nothing
and
he
was
grateful
for
wilson
visit
it
was
a
good
year
for
me
damned
good
but
time
running
short
i
better
brief
you
on
the
latest
on
the
plague
wilson
began
making
notes
until
doc
was
finished
finally
he
got
up
as
steps
sounded
from
the
hall
anything
else
just
a
guess
a
lot
of
earth
germs
ca
live
in
flesh
maybe
this
ca
live
in
tell
them
so
long
for
me
so
long
doc
he
shook
hands
briefly
and
was
waiting
at
the
door
when
the
guard
opened
it
an
hour
later
the
lobby
police
took
feldman
to
the
northport
shuttle
rocket
they
had
some
trouble
on
the
way
a
runner
cut
down
the
street
with
the
crowds
frantically
rushing
out
of
his
way
terror
was
reaching
the
cities
already
doc
flashed
a
look
at
chris
mob
hysteria
like
flying
saucers
and
wriggly
tops
i
suppose
he
asked
before
the
guard
could
stop
him
they
locked
his
legs
but
left
his
hands
free
in
the
rocket
he
unfolded
the
paper
wilson
had
brought
and
buried
his
face
in
it
then
he
swore
they
explaining
the
runners
as
a
case
of
mob
hysteria
northport
was
calmer
apparently
they
had
yet
to
have
experience
with
the
plague
but
now
nothing
seemed
quite
real
to
doc
even
when
they
locked
him
into
the
big
northport
jail
the
whole
ritual
of
the
lobbies
seemed
like
a
fantasy
after
the
villages
it
snapped
back
into
focus
however
when
they
led
him
into
the
trial
room
of
the
medical
lobby
building
it
was
a
smaller
version
of
his
trial
on
earth
fear
washed
in
by
association
the
complete
lack
of
humanity
in
the
procedure
was
something
from
a
and
horrible
past
the
presiding
officer
asked
the
routine
question
is
the
prisoner
represented
by
counsel
blane
the
dapper
little
prosecutor
arose
quickly
the
prisoner
is
a
pariah
sir
magistrate
very
well
the
court
will
accept
the
protective
function
for
the
prisoner
you
may
proceed
be
judge
i
be
and
prosecution
and
defense
it
made
for
a
lot
less
trouble
of
course
if
space
lobby
had
asserted
interest
it
would
have
gone
to
a
supposedly
neutral
court
but
as
usual
space
was
happy
to
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
medical
the
tape
was
played
as
evidence
doc
frowned
the
words
were
his
but
there
had
been
a
lot
of
editing
that
subtly
changed
the
import
of
his
notes
i
protest
he
challenged
it
not
an
accurate
version
the
lobby
magistrate
turned
a
wooden
face
to
him
does
the
prisoner
have
a
different
version
to
introduce
no
but
the
evidence
is
accepted
one
of
the
prisoner
six
protests
will
be
charged
against
him
blane
smiled
smoothly
and
held
up
a
small
package
we
wish
to
introduce
this
drug
as
evidence
that
the
prisoner
is
a
confirmed
addict
morally
irresponsible
under
addiction
this
is
a
package
of
bracky
weed
a
vile
and
noxious
substance
found
in
his
possession
it
has
alkaloids
no
more
harmful
than
nicotine
feldman
stated
sharply
do
you
contend
that
you
find
the
taste
pleasing
blane
asked
it
bitter
but
i
gotten
used
to
it
i
tasted
it
the
magistrate
said
evidence
accepted
two
deductions
one
for
irregularity
of
presentation
doc
shrugged
and
sat
back
he
tested
his
rights
and
found
what
he
expected
it
was
hard
to
see
now
how
he
had
ever
accepted
such
procedure
jake
must
be
right
they
been
in
power
too
long
and
were
making
the
mistake
of
taking
the
velvet
glove
off
the
iron
fist
and
flailing
about
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
power
it
dragged
on
while
he
became
a
greater
and
greater
monster
on
the
record
but
finally
it
was
over
and
the
magistrate
turned
to
feldman
you
may
present
your
defense
i
ask
complete
freedom
of
expression
doc
said
formally
the
magistrate
nodded
this
is
a
closed
court
permission
granted
the
recording
will
be
scrambled
the
last
bit
ruined
most
of
the
purpose
doc
had
in
mind
but
it
was
too
late
to
change
he
could
only
hope
that
some
one
of
the
medical
men
present
would
remember
something
of
what
he
said
i
have
nothing
to
say
for
myself
he
began
it
would
be
useless
but
i
had
to
do
what
i
did
there
a
plague
outside
i
studied
that
plague
and
i
have
knowledge
which
must
be
used
against
it
he
sat
down
in
three
minutes
it
had
been
useless
blane
arose
with
a
smile
still
plastered
on
his
face
we
of
course
recognize
the
existence
of
a
new
contagion
but
i
believe
we
have
established
that
this
is
one
disseminated
by
the
prisoner
himself
and
probably
not
directly
contagious
there
have
been
many
cases
of
fanatics
ready
to
destroy
humanity
to
eliminate
those
they
hate
now
surely
the
prisoner
has
himself
left
no
question
of
his
attitude
he
asserts
he
has
knowledge
and
skill
greater
than
the
entire
medical
research
staff
he
has
attempted
to
intimidate
us
by
threats
he
is
clearly
psychopathic
and
dangerously
so
the
prosecution
rests
the
guards
took
doc
into
the
anteroom
where
he
was
supposed
to
hear
nothing
that
went
on
but
their
curiosity
was
stronger
than
their
discretion
and
the
door
remained
a
trifle
ajar
the
magistrate
began
the
discussion
the
case
seems
firm
enough
fortunate
ryan
acted
so
quickly
with
some
of
the
people
getting
nervous
perhaps
it
might
be
wise
to
publicize
our
verdict
my
thought
exactly
blane
agreed
if
we
show
feldman
is
responsible
and
that
medical
is
eliminating
the
source
of
the
infection
it
may
have
a
stabilizing
effect
let
hope
so
the
sentence
will
have
to
be
death
of
course
we
let
such
a
rebellious
psychopath
live
but
this
needs
something
more
it
seems
you
prepared
a
recommendation
i
suppose
there
was
the
case
of
albrecht
delier
blane
suggested
something
like
that
should
have
good
publicity
impact
it
struck
doc
that
they
sounded
as
if
they
believed
themselves
as
the
had
believed
in
witches
he
was
sweating
when
the
guards
led
him
before
the
bench
the
magistrate
rolled
a
pen
slowly
across
his
fingers
as
his
eyes
raked
feldman
pariah
daniel
feldman
you
have
been
found
guilty
on
all
counts
furthermore
your
guilt
must
be
shared
by
that
entire
section
of
mars
known
as
the
villages
therefore
the
entire
section
shall
be
banned
and
forbidden
any
and
all
services
of
the
medical
lobby
for
a
period
of
one
year
sir
magistrate
one
of
the
members
of
southport
hospital
staff
was
on
his
feet
sir
magistrate
we
ca
cut
them
off
completely
we
must
harkness
i
appreciate
the
fine
humanitarian
tradition
of
our
lobby
which
lies
behind
your
protest
but
at
such
a
time
as
this
the
good
of
the
body
politic
requires
drastic
measures
why
not
see
me
after
court
and
we
can
discuss
it
then
he
turned
back
to
feldman
and
his
face
was
severe
the
same
education
which
has
produced
such
fine
young
men
as
harkness
was
wasted
on
you
and
perverted
to
endanger
the
whole
race
no
punishment
can
equal
your
crimes
but
there
is
one
previously
invoked
for
a
particularly
horrible
case
and
it
seems
fitting
that
you
should
be
the
fourth
so
sentenced
daniel
feldman
you
are
sentenced
to
be
taken
in
to
space
beyond
planetary
limits
together
with
all
material
used
by
you
in
the
furtherance
of
your
criminal
acts
there
you
shall
be
placed
into
a
spacesuit
containing
sufficient
oxygen
for
one
hour
of
life
and
no
more
you
and
your
contaminated
possessions
shall
then
be
released
into
space
to
drift
there
through
all
eternity
as
a
warning
to
other
men
this
sentence
shall
be
executed
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
christina
ryan
is
hereby
commissioned
to
observe
such
execution
and
may
god
have
mercy
on
your
soul
x
execution
the
hours
of
waiting
were
blurred
for
doc
there
were
periods
when
fear
clogged
his
throat
and
left
him
gasping
with
the
need
to
scream
and
beat
his
cell
walls
there
were
also
times
when
it
did
seem
to
matter
and
when
his
only
thoughts
were
for
the
villages
and
the
plague
they
brought
him
the
papers
where
he
was
painted
as
a
monster
beside
whom
jack
the
ripper
and
albrecht
delier
were
gentle
amateurs
they
were
trying
to
focus
all
fear
and
resentment
on
him
maybe
it
was
working
there
were
screaming
crowds
outside
the
jail
and
the
noise
of
their
hatred
was
strong
enough
to
carry
through
even
the
atmosphere
of
mars
but
there
were
also
signs
that
the
lobby
was
worried
as
if
afraid
that
some
attempt
might
still
be
made
to
rescue
him
he
looked
forward
to
the
trip
to
the
airport
as
a
way
of
judging
public
reaction
but
apparently
the
lobby
had
no
desire
to
test
that
the
guards
led
him
up
to
the
roof
of
the
jail
where
a
rocket
was
waiting
the
landing
space
was
too
small
for
one
of
the
station
shuttles
but
a
little
shuttle
was
parked
there
after
what
must
have
been
a
difficult
the
guards
tested
manacles
and
forced
him
into
the
shuttle
inside
chris
was
waiting
carrying
an
official
automatic
there
was
also
a
young
pilot
looking
nervous
and
unhappy
he
was
muttering
under
his
breath
as
the
guards
locked
doc
legs
to
a
seat
and
left
all
right
chris
ordered
up
ship
i
tell
you
we
overweight
with
you
i
was
counting
on
three
for
the
trip
the
pilot
protested
the
only
thing
that
will
get
this
into
orbit
with
the
station
is
faith
i
loaded
with
every
drop
of
fuel
she
hold
and
it
still
is
enough
that
your
problem
chris
told
him
firmly
you
got
your
orders
and
so
have
i
up
ship
if
she
had
her
own
worries
about
the
shuttle
she
did
show
it
chris
had
never
been
afraid
to
do
what
she
felt
she
should
the
pilot
stared
at
her
doubtfully
and
finally
turned
back
to
his
controls
still
muttering
the
shuttle
lifted
sluggishly
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
doc
could
see
that
there
was
even
some
fuel
remaining
when
they
slipped
into
the
tube
at
the
orbital
station
chris
went
out
and
other
guards
came
in
to
free
him
so
long
feldman
the
pilot
called
softly
as
they
led
him
out
then
the
guards
shoved
him
through
the
airlock
into
the
station
fifteen
minutes
later
he
was
locked
into
one
of
the
cabins
of
the
with
all
his
possessions
stacked
beside
him
he
grinned
wryly
as
an
honest
worker
on
the
he
been
treated
like
an
animal
now
as
a
human
fiend
he
was
installed
in
a
luxury
cabin
of
the
finest
ship
of
the
fleet
with
constant
spin
to
give
a
feeling
of
weight
and
more
room
than
the
entire
tube
crew
had
known
he
roamed
the
cabin
until
he
found
a
little
collapsible
table
he
set
the
electron
microscope
up
on
that
and
plugged
it
in
it
seemed
a
shame
that
good
equipment
should
be
wasted
along
with
his
life
he
wondered
if
they
would
really
throw
it
out
into
space
with
him
probably
they
would
he
pushed
a
button
on
the
call
board
over
the
table
and
asked
for
the
steward
there
was
a
long
wait
as
if
the
procedure
were
being
checked
with
some
authority
but
finally
he
received
a
surly
acknowledgement
steward
whatcha
want
how
the
chance
of
getting
some
food
you
on
they
could
afford
it
doc
decided
he
would
cost
them
much
considering
the
distance
he
was
going
bring
me
two
complete
dinners
one
and
one
okay
feldman
but
if
you
think
you
can
suicide
that
way
you
wrong
you
may
be
sick
but
you
be
alive
when
they
dump
you
a
sharp
click
interrupted
him
that
enough
steward
captain
everts
speaking
feldman
you
have
my
apologies
until
you
reach
your
destination
you
are
my
passenger
and
entitled
to
every
consideration
of
any
other
passenger
except
freedom
of
movement
through
the
ship
i
am
always
available
for
legitimate
complaints
feldman
shook
his
head
he
heard
of
such
men
but
he
thought
the
species
extinct
the
steward
brought
his
food
in
a
thoroughly
chastened
manner
he
managed
to
find
space
for
it
and
came
to
attention
is
that
all
sir
for
a
moment
as
the
smell
of
real
steak
reached
him
doc
regretted
the
fact
that
his
metabolism
had
been
switched
then
he
shrugged
a
little
would
hurt
him
though
there
was
no
proper
nourishment
in
it
he
squeezed
some
of
the
gravy
and
bits
of
meat
into
one
of
his
bottles
sticking
to
his
purpose
then
he
fell
to
on
the
rest
but
after
a
few
bites
it
was
queerly
unsatisfactory
the
seemingly
unappealing
ragout
suited
his
current
tastes
better
after
all
once
the
steward
had
cleared
away
the
dishes
doc
went
to
work
it
was
better
than
wasting
his
time
in
dread
he
might
even
be
able
to
leave
some
notes
behind
a
gong
sounded
and
a
red
light
warned
him
that
acceleration
was
due
he
finished
with
his
bottles
put
them
into
the
incubator
and
piled
into
his
bunk
swallowing
one
of
the
tablets
of
morphetal
the
ship
furnished
acceleration
had
ended
and
a
simple
breakfast
was
waiting
when
he
awoke
there
was
also
a
red
flashing
light
over
the
call
board
he
flipped
the
switch
while
reaching
for
the
coffee
captain
everts
the
speaker
said
may
i
join
you
in
your
cabin
come
ahead
feldman
invited
he
cut
off
the
switch
and
glanced
at
the
clock
on
the
wall
there
were
less
than
eleven
hours
left
to
him
everts
was
a
trim
man
of
forty
erect
but
not
rigid
there
was
neither
friendliness
nor
hostility
in
his
glance
his
words
were
courteous
as
doc
motioned
toward
the
tray
of
breakfast
i
already
eaten
thank
you
he
accepted
a
chair
his
voice
was
apologetic
when
he
began
this
is
a
personal
matter
which
i
perhaps
have
no
right
to
bring
up
but
my
wife
is
greatly
worried
about
this
plague
i
violate
no
confidence
in
telling
you
there
is
considerable
unease
even
on
earth
according
to
messages
i
have
received
the
ship
physician
believes
everts
may
have
the
plague
but
is
sure
of
the
symptoms
i
understand
you
are
quite
expert
doc
wondered
about
the
physician
apparently
there
was
another
man
who
placed
his
patients
above
anything
else
though
he
was
probably
meticulous
about
obeying
all
actual
rules
there
was
no
law
against
listening
to
a
pariah
at
least
when
did
she
have
selznik
migraine
he
asked
about
thirteen
years
ago
we
went
through
it
together
shortly
after
having
our
metabolism
switched
during
the
food
shortage
of
doc
felt
carefully
at
the
base
of
the
captain
skull
the
swelling
was
there
he
asked
a
few
questions
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
both
of
you
must
have
it
captain
though
it
wo
mature
for
another
year
i
sorry
there
no
hope
then
doc
studied
the
man
but
everts
was
the
sort
to
dicker
even
for
his
life
nothing
that
i
found
captain
i
have
a
clue
but
i
still
working
on
it
perhaps
if
i
could
leave
a
few
notes
for
your
physician
it
was
everts
turn
to
shake
his
head
i
sorry
feldman
i
have
orders
to
burn
out
your
cabin
when
you
leave
but
thank
you
he
got
to
his
feet
and
left
as
quietly
and
erectly
as
he
had
entered
doc
tore
up
his
notes
bitterly
he
paced
his
cabin
slowly
reading
out
the
hours
while
his
eyes
lingered
on
the
little
bottle
of
cultures
at
times
the
fear
grew
in
him
but
he
mastered
it
there
was
half
an
hour
left
when
he
began
opening
the
little
bottles
and
making
his
films
he
was
still
not
finished
when
steps
echoed
down
the
hall
but
he
was
reasonably
sure
of
his
results
the
bug
could
not
grow
in
tissue
three
men
entered
the
room
one
of
them
dressed
in
a
spacesuit
held
out
another
suit
to
him
the
other
two
began
gathering
up
everything
in
the
cabin
and
stowing
it
neatly
into
a
sack
designed
to
protect
freight
for
a
limited
time
in
a
vacuum
doc
forced
his
hands
to
steadiness
with
foolish
pride
and
began
climbing
into
the
suit
he
reached
for
the
helmet
but
the
man
shook
his
head
pointing
to
the
oxygen
gauge
there
would
be
exactly
one
hour
supply
of
oxygen
when
he
was
thrown
out
and
it
still
lacked
five
minutes
of
the
deadline
they
marched
him
down
the
hallway
to
meet
everts
coming
toward
them
there
were
still
three
minutes
left
when
they
reached
the
airlock
with
its
inner
door
already
open
the
spacesuited
man
climbed
into
it
and
began
strapping
down
so
that
the
rush
of
air
would
not
sweep
him
outward
when
the
other
seal
was
released
doc
had
saved
one
bracky
weed
now
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
fumbling
for
a
light
everts
stepped
forward
and
flipped
a
lighter
doc
inhaled
deeply
fear
was
thick
in
every
muscle
and
he
needed
the
smoke
desperately
then
he
caught
himself
better
change
your
metabolism
back
to
captain
everts
he
said
and
his
voice
was
so
normal
that
he
hardly
recognized
it
everts
eyes
widened
briefly
the
man
bowed
faintly
thank
you
dr
feldman
it
was
ridiculous
impossible
and
yet
there
was
a
curious
relief
at
the
formality
of
it
it
was
like
something
from
a
play
too
unreal
to
affect
his
life
everts
nodded
to
the
man
holding
the
helmet
doc
dropped
his
bracky
weed
and
felt
the
helmet
snap
down
a
hiss
of
oxygen
reached
him
and
the
suit
ballooned
out
there
was
no
gravity
the
two
men
handed
him
up
easily
to
the
one
in
the
airlock
while
the
inner
seal
began
to
close
there
was
still
ten
seconds
to
go
according
to
the
big
chronometer
that
had
been
installed
in
the
lock
the
spaceman
used
it
in
tying
the
sack
of
possessions
firmly
to
doc
suit
a
red
light
went
on
the
man
caught
doc
and
held
him
against
the
outer
seal
the
red
light
blinked
four
seconds
three
two
there
was
a
sudden
heavy
thudding
sound
and
the
seemed
to
jerk
sideways
slightly
the
spaceman
face
swung
around
in
surprise
the
red
light
blinked
and
stayed
on
zero
the
outer
seal
snapped
open
and
the
spaceman
heaved
air
exploded
outwards
and
doc
went
with
it
he
was
alone
in
space
gliding
away
from
the
ship
with
oxygen
hissing
softly
through
the
valve
and
ticking
away
his
life
xi
convert
feldman
fought
for
control
of
himself
forced
himself
to
think
to
hold
onto
his
sanity
it
was
sheer
stupidity
since
nothing
could
have
been
more
merciful
than
to
lose
this
reality
but
the
will
to
be
himself
was
stronger
than
logic
and
bit
by
bit
he
forced
the
fear
and
horror
away
from
him
until
he
could
examine
his
situation
he
was
spinning
slowly
so
that
stars
ahead
of
him
seemed
to
crawl
across
his
view
the
ship
was
retreating
from
him
already
hundreds
of
yards
away
mars
was
a
shrunken
pill
far
away
then
something
blinked
to
one
side
he
turned
his
head
to
stare
a
little
ship
was
less
than
three
hundred
yards
away
he
recognized
it
as
a
life
raft
now
his
spin
brought
him
around
to
face
it
and
he
saw
it
was
parallelling
his
course
the
ejection
of
the
life
raft
must
have
caused
the
thump
he
heard
before
he
was
cast
adrift
it
meant
someone
was
trying
to
save
him
it
meant
he
flailed
his
arms
and
beat
his
legs
together
senselessly
trying
to
force
himself
closer
while
trying
to
guess
who
could
have
taken
the
chance
no
one
he
could
think
of
could
have
booked
passage
on
the
there
was
that
much
free
money
in
the
villages
something
flashed
a
hot
blue
and
the
little
ship
leaped
forward
whoever
was
handling
it
knew
nothing
about
piloting
it
picked
up
too
much
speed
at
too
great
an
angle
again
blue
spurts
came
but
this
time
matters
were
even
worse
then
there
was
a
long
wait
before
a
third
try
was
made
he
estimated
the
course
it
would
miss
him
by
a
good
hundred
feet
but
it
was
probably
the
best
the
amateur
pilot
could
do
the
ship
drifted
closer
but
to
one
side
it
would
soon
pass
him
completely
a
spacesuited
figure
suddenly
appeared
in
the
tiny
airlock
holding
a
coil
of
rope
the
rope
shot
out
well
thrown
but
it
was
too
short
it
would
pass
within
ten
feet
and
might
as
well
have
been
ten
miles
for
all
the
good
it
would
do
him
every
film
he
had
seen
on
space
seemed
to
form
a
mad
jumble
in
his
mind
but
he
seized
on
the
first
idea
he
could
remember
he
inhaled
deeply
and
yanked
the
oxygen
tank
free
an
automatic
seal
on
the
suit
cut
off
the
connection
he
aimed
the
hissing
bottle
fumbling
for
the
manual
valve
it
almost
worked
it
kicked
him
toward
the
rope
slightly
but
most
of
the
energy
was
wasted
in
setting
him
into
a
wilder
spin
he
blinked
trying
to
spot
the
rope
it
was
within
five
feet
now
again
he
waited
until
he
seemed
to
be
in
position
this
time
he
threw
the
bottle
away
from
it
it
added
spin
to
his
vertical
axis
but
the
rope
came
into
view
within
arm
reach
he
grasped
it
just
as
his
lungs
seemed
about
to
burst
he
could
hold
on
long
enough
to
tie
the
rope
his
lungs
gave
up
suddenly
collapsing
and
then
sucking
in
greedily
clean
air
rushed
in
letting
his
head
clear
he
forgotten
that
the
inflated
suit
held
enough
oxygen
for
several
minutes
his
body
struck
the
edge
of
the
airlock
and
a
hand
jerked
him
inside
the
outer
seal
was
slammed
shut
and
locked
and
there
was
a
hiss
of
air
entering
he
threw
back
his
helmet
just
as
chris
ryan
jerked
hers
off
her
voice
shook
almost
hysterically
thank
god
dan
i
almost
gave
up
i
liked
the
air
out
there
better
he
told
her
bitterly
if
open
the
lock
again
i
leave
or
am
i
supposed
to
believe
this
is
rescue
and
that
you
came
along
just
to
save
me
i
came
along
to
see
you
killed
as
you
know
very
well
saving
you
was
in
my
orders
he
grunted
and
reached
for
the
handle
that
would
release
the
outer
lock
better
get
back
inside
if
you
do
want
to
blow
out
with
me
it
up
to
you
dan
she
told
him
and
there
was
all
the
sincerity
in
the
world
in
her
blue
eyes
i
on
your
side
now
he
began
counting
on
his
fingers
let
see
the
spare
battery
the
delay
in
arresting
me
the
choice
of
matthews
it
was
all
true
anger
began
to
grow
in
her
eyes
dan
feldman
you
get
inside
this
raft
if
you
do
care
about
me
you
might
consider
the
people
dying
of
the
plague
who
need
you
she
played
her
trump
and
it
took
the
round
he
followed
her
all
right
he
said
grudgingly
spill
your
story
she
held
out
a
copy
of
a
space
radiogram
addressed
to
everts
and
signed
by
one
of
the
best

commented
dryly
come
off

chris
she
the
daughter
of
elmers
of
space
lobby
chris
answered
she
pointed
to
the
message
underlining
words
with
her
finger
you
could
have
caused
it
and
people
are
being
told
it
only
a
skin
disease
but
already
done
most
of
the
research
i
can
see
that
now
i
can
see
a
lot
of
things
you
got
me
beat
then
he
said
i
ca
see
how
such
a
reformed
young
noblewoman
calmly
walked
over
and
stole
a
life
raft
i
ca
see
how
your
brilliant
mind
concocted
this
whole
scheme
in
almost
no
time
and
to
be
honest
i
ca
even
see
why
medical
lobby
decided
to
save
me
at
the
last
minute
and
sent
you
to
do
the
job
you
did
have
to
spy
out
knowledge
from
me
i
been
trying
all
along
to
get
it
to
your
research
division
she
sighed
and
dropped
onto
a
little
seat
i
ca
prove
my
motives
you
just
have
to
believe
me
but
it
hard
to
do
what
i
done
that
shuttle
pilot
was
found
in
a
routine
check
stowed
away
on
the
life
raft
i
was
with
captain
everts
when
he
was
found
so
i
discovered
how
to
get
into
the
raft
and
i
heard
his
whole
confession
he
was
the
real
pilot
he
come
from
the
villages
to
save
you
the
whole
scheme
was
his
i
just
used
it
hoping
i
could
reach
you
as
always
her
story
had
a
convincing
element
she
should
have
known
the
pilot
farewell
addressing
him
as
feldman
had
been
too
low
for
her
to
hear
but
it
was
something
that
fitted
her
story
it
was
probably
a
deliberate
clue
to
give
him
hope
to
assure
him
the
villages
were
still
trying
it
shook
his
confidence
and
your
motive
your
real
motive
he
insisted
she
swore
at
him
then
began
ripping
off
the
spacesuit
she
turned
her
back
pulling
a
thin
blouse
down
from
her
neck
he
stared
then
reached
out
to
touch
the
lump
there
so
you
had
selznik
migraine
and
know
you
carrying
plague
and
you
decided
your
precious
lobby
wo
save
you
she
dropped
her
eyes
then
raised
them
to
meet
his
defiantly
i
not
just
scared
and
selfish
dad
caught
it
too
and
it
must
be
close
to
the
time
for
him
he
switched
to
when
he
was
a
liaison
agent
and
never
changed
back
dan
are
we
all
going
to
have
to
die
ca
you
save
him
feldman
was
out
of
his
suit
and
at
the
control
panel
there
was
a
manual
lever
which
chris
must
have
used
before
it
might
work
out
here
where
there
was
room
to
maneuver
and
nothing
to
hit
but
trying
to
make
a
landing
was
going
to
be
different
dan
she
repeated
he
shrugged
i
do
know
they
started
research
too
late
and
they
be
under
so
much
pressure
that
the
real
brains
wo
have
a
chance
the
topsecret
stuff
looks
bad
for
research
maybe
there
a
cure
it
works
in
culture
bottles
but
it
may
fail
in
person
when
convinced
i
safe
with
you
i
may
tell
you
about
it
oh
her
voice
was
low
then
she
sighed
i
suppose
i
can
understand
why
you
hate
me
dan
i
do
hate
you
i
too
mixed
up
tomorrow
maybe
but
not
now
shut
up
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
figure
out
how
to
land
this
thing
he
found
that
the
fuel
tanks
were
nearly
full
but
that
still
leave
much
margin
mars
must
have
been
notified
by
everts
and
be
ready
to
pick
the
raft
up
he
had
to
reach
the
wastelands
away
from
any
of
the
shuttle
ports
they
had
no
aspirators
however
and
they
could
cover
much
territory
in
the
spacesuits
they
would
have
to
use
it
meant
have
to
land
close
to
a
village
where
he
was
known
he
jockeyed
the
ship
around
by
trial
and
error
studying
the
manual
that
was
lying
prominently
on
the
control
panel
according
to
the
booklet
the
ship
was
simple
to
operate
it
was
in
an
atmosphere
and
automatic
flare
computers
were
supposed
to
make
it
possible
for
an
amateur
to
judge
the
rate
of
descent
near
the
surface
it
looked
reassuring
and
was
probably
written
with
that
in
mind
finally
he
reached
for
the
control
hoping
he
figured
his
landing
orbit
reasonably
well
by
simple
logic
he
smoothed
it
out
in
the
following
hours
as
he
watched
the
markings
on
mars
when
they
were
near
turnover
point
he
began
cranking
the
little
gyroscope
to
swing
the
ship
it
saved
fuel
to
turn
without
power
and
he
was
sure
he
could
have
turned
accurately
by
blasting
he
was
gaining
some
proficiency
however
he
felt
but
now
he
had
to
waste
fuel
and
ruin
his
orbit
again
there
was
no
way
to
practice
maneuvering
without
actually
doing
so
in
the
end
he
compromised
leaving
a
small
margin
for
a
bad
landing
that
would
require
a
second
attempt
but
with
less
practice
than
he
wanted
he
had
located
jake
village
through
the
little
telescope
when
he
finally
reached
for
the
main
blast
control
the
thin
haze
of
atmosphere
came
rushing
up
while
the
blast
lashed
out
then
they
were
in
the
outer
fringes
of
the
sky
and
the
blast
was
beginning
to
show
a
corona
that
ruined
visibility
he
turned
to
the
flare
computer
and
back
to
what
he
could
see
through
the
quartz
viewport
he
was
going
to
land
about
half
a
mile
from
the
village
as
nearly
as
he
could
judge
the
computer
seemed
to
work
as
it
should
the
speed
was
within
acceptable
limits
he
gave
up
trying
to
see
the
ground
and
was
forced
to
trust
the
machinery
designed
for
amateur
pilots
the
flare
bloomed
and
he
yanked
down
on
the
little
lever
it
could
have
been
worse
they
hit
the
ground
bounced
twice
and
turned
over
the
ship
was
a
mess
when
feldman
freed
himself
from
the
elastic
straps
of
the
seat
chris
had
shrieked
as
they
hit
but
she
was
unbuckling
herself
now
he
threw
her
her
spacesuit
and
one
of
the
emergency
bottles
of
oxygen
from
the
rack
hurry
up
with
that
we
sprung
a
leak
and
the
pressure
dropping
they
were
halfway
to
the
village
when
a
dozen
tractors
came
racing
up
and
jake
piled
out
of
the
lead
one
to
drag
the
two
in
with
him
heard
about
it
from
the
broadcasts
and
figured
you
might
land
around
here
good
to
see
you
doc
he
started
the
tractor
off
at
full
speed
back
to
the
wastelands
while
doc
stared
at
the
armed
men
who
were
riding
the
tractors
jake
caught
his
look
and
nodded
you
in
enemy
territory
doc
there
a
war
going
on
xii
war
sometimes
it
seemed
to
doc
that
war
was
nothing
but
an
endurance
race
to
see
how
many
times
they
could
run
before
they
were
bombed
he
was
just
beginning
to
drop
off
to
sleep
after
a
long
trip
for
the
sixth
consecutive
day
when
the
little
alarm
shrilled
he
sighed
and
shook
chris
awake
again
she
protested
but
she
got
up
and
began
helping
him
pack
jake
came
in
his
eyes
weary
pulling
on
the
old
jacket
with
the
big
star
on
its
sleeve
doc
had
been
too
surprised
to
learn
that
jake
was
the
actual
leader
of
the
rebels
shuttles
spotted
taking
off
this
way
and
i
still
ca
find
where
the
leak
is
they
have
missed
our
location
once
this
week
here
give
me
that
he
took
the
electron
mike
that
had
been
among
doc
possessions
but
chris
recaptured
it
i
can
manage
she
told
him
and
headed
out
for
the
tractor
where
lou
was
waiting
doc
scowled
after
her
he
and
jake
had
been
watching
her
she
was
too
useful
to
doc
research
to
be
turned
away
but
they
did
trust
her
yet
so
far
however
they
had
found
nothing
wrong
with
her
conduct
still
he
swung
suddenly
into
jake
tractor
just
remembered
something
they
find
me
that
time
i
stopped
in
the
tractor
to
use
the
mike
i
was
pretty
well
hidden
and
no
tracks
last
in
the
sand
long
enough
for
them
to
have
followed
but
they
were
there
when
i
came
to
somehow
they
must
have
put
a
radio
tracer
on
me
jake
waited
while
they
lighted
up
his
eyes
suddenly
bright
you
mean
something
you
got
from
her
house
was
bugged
it
figures
and
i
still
got
all
the
stuff
now
they
find
wherever
we
set
up
headquarters
though
they
always
managed
to
miss
my
laboratory
even
when
they
hit
the
troops
around
us
jake
i
think
it
the
microscope
doc
managed
to
push
enough
junk
off
one
of
the
seats
to
make
a
cramped
bed
and
stretched
out
sure
we
figured
they
sent
her
because
they
want
to
keep
tabs
on
what
i
discover
they
finally
gotten
scared
of
the
plague
and
she
the
perfect
judas
goat
but
they
have
to
have
some
way
to
get
in
touch
with
her
i
bet
there
a
tracer
in
the
mike
and
a
switch
so
she
can
modulate
it
or
key
it
to
send
out
morse
yeah
jake
nodded
well
she
does
her
own
dirty
work
i
might
get
to
like
her
if
she
was
on
our
side
okay
doc
if
they
put
things
into
the
mike
i
got
a
boy
who
find
and
fix
it
so
she
wo
guess
been
touched
doc
relaxed
for
the
moment
there
would
be
no
power
in
the
instrument
nor
any
excuse
for
her
to
use
it
but
she
must
have
handled
some
secret
arrangement
during
the
work
periods
she
used
the
mike
more
than
he
did
the
switch
could
be
camouflaged
easily
enough
if
anyone
detected
the
signal
they
probably
only
think
it
was
some
leak
in
the
electrical
circuit
far
away
the
shuttle
rockets
had
appeared
as
tiny
dots
in
the
sky
they
were
standing
on
their
tails
a
second
later
just
off
the
ground
letting
the
full
force
of
their
blasts
bake
the
area
where
headquarters
had
been
jake
watched
grimly
driving
by
something
close
to
instinct
then
he
looked
back
know
anything
about
a
dr
harkness
not
much
except
that
he
protested
sealing
off
the
villages
why
he
and
five
other
doctors
were
picked
up
trying
to
get
through
to
us
claimed
they
wanted
to
give
us
medical
help
we
can
use
them
god
knows
i
guess
i
have
to
chance
it
they
stopped
at
a
halfway
village
and
hid
the
tractors
before
looking
for
a
place
to
rest
doc
found
chris
curled
up
asleep
against
the
microscope
he
had
a
hard
time
getting
her
to
leave
it
in
the
tractor
but
she
was
too
genuinely
tired
to
put
up
any
real
argument
jake
reported
in
the
morning
before
they
set
out
again
you
were
right
doc
it
was
a
nice
job
of
work
must
have
taken
the
best
guys
in
southport
to
hide
the
circuit
so
well
but
it
safe
now
it
just
makes
a
kind
of
meaningless
static
nobody
can
trace
maybe
we
can
get
you
a
permanent
lab
now
doc
debated
again
having
chris
left
behind
and
decided
against
it
the
lobby
was
determined
to
let
him
find
a
cure
for
them
if
he
could
that
meant
chris
would
work
herself
to
exhaustion
trying
to
help
let
her
think
she
was
doing
it
for
the
lobby
it
was
time
she
was
on
the
receiving
end
of
a
double
cross
it
a
stinking
way
to
run
a
war
he
decided
jake
chuckled
without
much
humor
it
the
war
you
wanted
remember
they
forced
our
hand
but
it
had
to
come
sometime
right
now
the
fighting
to
get
their
hands
on
your
work
before
we
can
use
it
just
using
holding
tactics
which
helps
our
side
and
we
hoping
you
get
the
cure
so
we
can
win
with
that
maybe
we
whip
them
it
was
a
crazy
war
with
each
side
killing
more
of
its
own
men
than
of
the
enemy
the
runners
were
increasing
and
jake
army
was
learning
to
shoot
the
poor
devils
mercifully
and
go
on
they
knew
at
least
that
there
was
no
current
danger
of
infection
in
the
lobby
towns
more
were
dying
of
panic
in
their
efforts
to
escape
the
runners
desert
towns
had
joined
the
villages
reluctantly
but
inevitably
to
give
the
rebels
nearly
of
the
total
population
but
the
lobby
forces
and
the
few
cities
held
most
of
the
real
fighting
equipment
and
they
were
ready
to
wait
until
earth
could
send
out
unmanned
rockets
loaded
with
atomics
which
could
cut
through
space
at
ten
times
normal
speed
there
were
vague
lines
of
battle
but
time
was
the
vital
factor
the
lobbies
waited
to
steal
a
cure
for
the
plague
and
the
villages
waited
until
they
could
announce
it
and
demand
surrender
as
its
price
it
looked
as
if
both
sides
were
doomed
to
disappointment
however
he
and
chris
had
put
in
every
spare
minute
between
moving
and
the
minimum
of
sleep
in
searching
for
something
that
would
check
the
disease
it
could
grow
in
an
body
but
it
did
die
either
and
there
was
enough
normal
food
available
to
permit
the
for
more
than
a
handful
of
people
even
earth
was
out
of
luck
since
eighty
percent
of
her
population
ate
synthetics
there
were
ways
to
synthesize
food
but
they
were
still
hopelessly
inefficient
jake
had
ordered
one
of
the
villages
to
rebuild
their
plant
for
such
a
purpose
while
another
was
producing
the
enzyme
that
would
permit
switching
but
it
looked
hopeless
for
more
than
a
few
of
the
most
valuable
men
no
progress
jake
asked
for
the
hundredth
time
doc
grinned
wryly
a
lot
but
no
help
we
found
a
fine
accelerator
for
the
bug
we
can
speed
up
its
incubation
or
even
make
someone
already
infected
catch
it
all
over
again
but
we
ca
slow
it
down
or
stop
it
the
new
laboratory
was
still
being
fitted
when
they
arrived
it
had
been
dug
into
one
of
the
few
real
cliffs
in
this
section
of
mars
the
power
plant
had
been
installed
complete
with
a
steam
plant
that
would
operate
off
sunlight
in
the
daytime
through
a
series
of
heat
valves
that
took
in
a
lot
of
warm
air
and
produced
smaller
amounts
hot
enough
to
boil
water
i
see
you
whenever
i
can
jake
said
but
mostly
you
going
to
be
somewhat
isolated
so
they
wo
trace
you
let
them
think
they
goofed
with
the
shuttles
and
hit
you
and
chris
anything
you
need
guinea
pigs
doc
told
him
sarcastically
it
was
meant
as
a
joke
though
a
highly
bitter
one
jake
nodded
and
left
them
doc
opened
the
cots
as
chris
came
in
not
bothering
to
unpack
the
equipment
hit
the
sack
chris
he
told
her
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
you
almost
said
that
the
way
address
a
human
being
dan
you
slipping
one
of
these
days
like
me
again
maybe
he
was
too
tired
to
argue
i
doubt
it
though
forget
it
and
get
some
sleep
she
watched
him
silently
until
he
got
up
to
turn
out
the
light
then
she
sighed
heavily
dan
yeah
i
never
got
a
divorce
the
publicity
would
have
been
bad
but
anyway
we
still
married
that
nice
he
swung
to
face
her
briefly
and
they
found
the
radio
in
the
microscope
better
get
to
sleep
chris
oh
it
was
a
quiet
exclamation
barely
audible
there
was
a
sound
that
might
have
been
a
sniffle
if
it
had
come
from
anyone
else
then
she
rolled
over
all
right
dan
i
still
want
to
help
you
he
cursed
himself
for
a
stupid
fool
for
telling
her
fatigue
was
ruining
what
judgment
he
had
from
now
on
he
have
to
watch
her
every
minute
or
had
she
really
seen
the
value
of
the
research
by
now
she
was
a
fool
it
should
have
registered
on
even
her
stubborn
mind
but
he
was
too
sleepy
to
think
about
it
she
had
breakfast
ready
in
the
morning
she
made
no
comment
on
what
had
been
said
during
the
night
instead
she
began
discussing
a
way
to
keep
one
of
the
organic
antibiotics
from
splitting
into
simpler
compounds
when
they
tried
to
switch
it
over
to
they
were
both
hopelessly
bad
chemists
and
biologists
but
there
was
no
one
else
to
do
the
work
chris
worked
harder
than
ever
during
the
day
just
after
sundown
jake
came
in
with
a
heavy
box
he
dropped
it
onto
the
floor
mice
doc
ripped
off
the
cover
exposing
fine
screening
there
were
at
least
six
dozen
mice
inside
harkness
found
them
jake
explained
a
hormone
extraction
plant
used
them
for
testing
some
of
the
products
had
them
sent
by
regular
shipments
from
earth
getting
them
cost
a
couple
of
men
but
harkness
claims
it
worth
it
he
a
good
man
on
a
raid
here
he
gone
to
the
doorway
again
and
came
back
with
another
box
this
one
crammed
with
bottles
and
boxes
they
had
quite
a
laboratory
and
harkness
picked
out
whatever
he
thought
you
could
use
chris
and
doc
were
going
through
it
the
labels
were
engineering
ones
but
the
chemical
formulae
were
identification
enough
there
were
dozens
of
chemicals
they
had
hoped
to
get
anything
else
doc
finally
asked
as
they
began
arranging
the
supplies
more
runners
a
lot
more
we
still
holding
things
down
but
reaching
a
limit
panic
will
start
in
the
camps
if
this
keeps
on
but
that
my
worry
you
stick
to
yours
several
of
the
new
chemicals
showed
promise
in
the
tubes
but
two
of
them
proved
fatal
to
the
mice
and
the
others
were
completely
innocuous
in
the
little
animal
bodies
both
to
mouse
and
to
germ
the
plague
was
much
hardier
in
contact
with
living
cells
than
in
the
artificial
environment
of
the
culture
jars
they
lost
seven
mice
in
two
days
but
that
seemed
unimportant
the
females
were
already
living
up
to
their
reputations
nearly
all
pregnant
doc
did
know
the
gestation
period
but
he
remembered
that
it
was
short
funny
they
all
started
at
the
same
time
he
commented
must
have
been
shipped
out
separately
or
else
been
kept
apart
while
they
were
switched
over
to
something
interrupted
their
habits
anyhow
a
few
nights
later
they
learned
what
it
was
there
was
a
horrible
squealing
that
woke
him
out
of
the
depths
of
his
sleep
chris
was
already
at
the
light
switch
as
light
came
on
they
turned
to
the
mouse
box
all
the
animals
were
charging
about
in
their
limited
space
their
little
legs
driving
madly
and
their
mouths
open
what
they
lacked
in
size
they
made
up
in
numbers
and
the
din
was
terrific
but
it
did
last
one
by
one
the
mice
began
dropping
to
the
floor
of
the
cage
in
fifteen
minutes
they
were
all
dead
it
was
obviously
the
plague
contracted
after
having
their
metabolism
switched
women
were
sterile
for
some
time
after
selznik
migraine
struck
and
the
same
must
have
been
true
of
the
mice
they
must
have
contracted
the
plague
at
about
the
same
time
and
reached
fertility
together
somehow
the
plague
incubation
period
had
been
shortened
to
fit
their
life
span
the
disease
was
nothing
if
not
adaptive
chris
prepared
a
slide
in
dull
silence
the
familiar
cell
was
there
when
doc
looked
through
the
microscope
he
picked
up
one
of
the
little
creatures
and
cut
it
open
removing
one
of
the
foetuses
make
a
film
of
that
he
suggested
she
worked
rapidly
scraping
out
the
almost
microscopic
brain
dissolving
out
the
fatty
substance
and
transferring
the
result
to
a
film
this
time
even
at
full
magnification
there
was
no
sign
of
the
filaments
that
were
always
present
in
diseased
flesh
the
results
were
the
same
for
the
other
samples
they
made
something
about
the
very
young
animal
or
a
secretion
from
the
organs
keeps
the
bug
from
working
doc
reached
for
a
bracky
weed
and
accepted
a
light
from
chris
without
thinking
of
it
every
kid
heard
about
contracted
the
plague
between
the
second
and
third
year
none
are
born
with
it
none
get
it
earlier
i
suspected
this
but
now
here
confirmation
chris
began
preparing
specimens
while
doc
got
busy
with
tubes
of
the
culture
they
have
to
test
various
fluids
from
the
tiny
bodies
but
there
were
enough
cultures
prepared
then
if
the
substance
only
inhibited
growth
there
would
be
a
long
slow
test
if
it
killed
the
bugs
they
might
know
more
quickly
jake
came
in
before
the
final
tests
but
waited
on
them
doc
was
studying
a
film
in
the
microscope
he
suddenly
motioned
excitedly
for
chris
see
the
filaments
they
completely
disintegrated
and
there
one
of
the
big
cells
broken
open
we
got
it
it
in
the
blood
of
the
foetus
and
it
must
be
in
the
blood
of
newborn
children
too
jake
looked
at
the
slide
but
his
face
was
doubtful
maybe
you
got
something
doc
i
hope
so
and
i
hope
you
can
use
it
he
shook
his
head
wearily
we
need
good
news
right
now
a
couple
of
big
rockets
just
reached
the
station
and
they
been
sending
shuttles
back
and
forth
a
mile
a
minute
nobody
can
figure
how
they
got
here
so
fast
or
what
they
for
but
it
does
look
good
for
us
xiii
susceptibility
doc
could
feel
the
tension
in
the
village
where
ghq
was
temporarily
located
long
before
they
were
close
enough
for
details
to
register
the
people
were
gathered
in
clusters
staring
at
the
sky
where
the
station
must
be
a
few
were
pacing
up
and
down
gesticulating
with
tight
sweeps
of
their
arms
one
woman
suddenly
went
into
even
more
violent
action
she
leaped
into
the
air
and
then
took
off
at
a
rapid
trot
then
a
run
her
hands
were
tearing
at
her
clothes
and
her
mouth
seemed
to
be
working
violently
she
was
halfway
to
the
top
of
the
nearest
dune
before
a
rifle
cracked
she
dropped
to
twitch
once
and
lie
still
almost
with
her
death
another
figure
leaped
from
one
of
the
houses
his
face
bare
of
the
necessary
aspirator
he
took
off
at
a
violent
run
but
he
was
falling
from
lack
of
air
before
the
bullet
ended
his
struggles
the
people
suddenly
began
to
move
apart
as
if
trying
to
get
away
from
each
other
for
weeks
they
had
faced
the
horror
with
courage
now
it
was
finally
too
much
for
them
tension
mounted
as
no
news
came
from
the
cities
doc
noticed
that
it
seemed
to
aggravate
or
speed
up
the
disease
he
saw
three
men
shot
in
the
next
he
was
trying
to
calm
them
with
word
of
a
possible
cure
for
the
plague
but
their
reactions
were
as
curiously
dull
as
those
of
jake
had
been
as
he
spoke
they
faced
him
with
set
expressions
at
his
mention
of
the
need
for
the
blood
of
young
children
they
turned
from
him
sullenly
silent
jake
came
over
nodding
unhappily
it
what
i
was
afraid
might
happen
doc
george
lynn
tell
doc
what
wrong
lynn
was
reluctant
but
he
finally
stumbled
out
his
explanation
it
ai
like
you
doc
comes
from
that
lobby
woman
you
got
it
her
dirty
idea
we
seen
the
lobby
doctors
cutting
open
our
kids
poisoning
their
blood
and
bleeding
them
dry
that
ai
gon
na
happen
again
doc
you
tell
her
it
ai
doc
swore
as
he
realized
their
ignorance
an
unexplained
vaccination
looked
like
poisoning
of
the
blood
but
he
could
understand
the
bleeding
part
until
jake
filled
him
in
northport
infant
wing
each
department
has
its
own
blood
bank
and
donation
is
compulsory
southport
started
it
a
couple
months
ago
too
the
long
arm
of
the
lobby
had
reached
out
again
now
if
he
ever
got
them
to
try
the
treatment
it
would
be
only
after
long
sessions
of
preparing
them
with
the
facts
and
there
was
hardly
enough
time
for
the
crucial
work
by
afternoon
judge
ben
wilson
reached
them
his
voice
shook
with
fatigue
as
he
climbed
up
to
address
the
crowd
through
a
power
megaphone
southport
going
crazy
he
had
to
pause
for
breath
between
each
sentence
earth
pulling
back
all
the
important
people
packing
them
into
the
ships
they
leaving
only
colonials
with
no
earth
rights
those
ships
left
when
they
decided
the
plague
was
coming
from
here
they
wo
let
anybody
back
until
the
plague
is
licked
there
wo
be
an
earth
technician
on
mars
tomorrow
no
bombs
someone
called
no
bombs
the
ships
must
have
started
before
you
rebelled
maybe
meant
honestly
to
save
their
own
kind
but
now
it
a
military
action
and
do
think
it
wo
mean
trouble
the
poor
devils
in
the
city
bet
on
the
wrong
horse
now
they
ca
run
their
food
factories
or
anything
else
for
long
not
without
technicians
they
got
to
whip
you
now
up
to
this
time
they
been
fighting
for
the
lobbies
now
they
fight
you
for
their
own
bellies
to
get
your
supplies
and
they
still
got
shuttle
rockets
and
fuel
for
them
now
beat
it
i
got
ta
confer
with
jake
doc
started
after
the
judge
but
harkness
caught
his
arm
and
drew
him
aside
chris
followed
i
found
another
epidemic
harkness
told
them
over
at
marconi
it
kept
me
on
the
run
all
night
and
now
half
the
village
is
down
with
it
starts
like
a
common
cold
runs
a
fair
fever
and
the
skin
breaks
out
all
over
with
bright
red
dots
he
went
on
describing
it
chris
began
asking
him
about
what
medical
supplies
he
had
brought
with
him
pilfered
from
northport
hospital
she
seemed
to
know
what
it
was
but
refused
to
say
until
she
saw
the
cases
doc
also
preferred
to
wait
sometimes
things
were
as
bad
as
they
seemed
though
usually
they
were
worse
marconi
was
dead
to
all
outward
appearances
with
nobody
on
the
streets
it
had
been
a
village
of
great
hopes
a
week
before
since
this
was
where
they
had
decided
to
experiment
with
switching
the
people
back
to
they
had
the
best
chance
of
survival
of
anyone
on
mars
until
this
came
up
three
people
lay
on
the
beds
in
the
first
house
harkness
led
them
to
the
room
was
darkened
and
a
man
was
stumbling
around
trying
to
tend
the
others
though
the
little
spots
showed
on
his
skin
he
grinned
weakly
hi
doc
i
guess
we
making
a
lot
of
trouble
ai
we
chris
gave
doc
no
chance
to
answer
just
as
i
thought
measles
plain
measles
figured
so
the
sick
man
said
like
my
brother
back
on
earth
the
others
looked
doubtful
but
doc
reassured
them
chris
should
know
she
worked
in
a
swanky
hospital
where
the
patients
were
mostly
measles
was
one
of
the
diseases
which
was
foiled
by
the
metabolism
switch
well
at
least
they
would
have
to
be
quarantined
here
chris
finished
treating
the
family
with
impersonal
efficiency
discussing
the
symptoms
loudly
with
harkness
it
a
good
thing
it
is
serious
no
harkness
answered
bitterly
not
serious
it
only
killed
five
children
and
three
adults
so
far
it
would
here
doc
agreed
unhappily
he
led
chris
out
of
the
room
on
the
pretext
of
washing
his
hands
it
serious
enough
to
force
us
to
abandon
the
whole
idea
of
going
back
to
measles
today
smallpox
tuberculosis
scarlet
fever
and
everything
else
tomorrow
these
people
have
lived
so
long
their
natural
immunity
has
been
destroyed
on
earth
where
the
disease
was
everywhere
kids
used
to
pick
up
some
immunity
with
constant
exposure
even
without
what
might
be
called
a
case
of
the
disease
here
the
blood
has
no
reason
to
build
antibodies
they
can
be
killed
by
things
people
used
to
laugh
at
how
the
disease
got
here
i
do
know
but
it
here
so
we
have
to
give
up
the
idea
of
switching
back
to
he
gathered
up
one
of
the
kits
and
started
toward
the
other
houses
and
lord
knows
how
long
it
will
take
to
get
the
blood
for
the
other
treatment
even
if
it
works
they
worked
as
a
team
for
a
while
with
harkness
frowning
as
he
watched
chris
finally
the
young
doctor
stopped
chris
outside
the
fifth
house
these
are
my
patients
ryan
i
left
the
lobby
because
i
believe
colonials
were
mere
livestock
i
still
feel
the
same
i
appreciate
your
help
in
diagnosis
and
methods
of
treatment
but
i
let
you
handle
my
patients
this
way
dan
she
swung
around
with
eyes
glazing
dan
are
you
going
to
stand
for
that
i
think
you
better
wait
in
the
tractor
chris
he
was
lucky
enough
to
catch
the
kit
she
threw
at
him
before
its
precious
contents
spilled
but
it
was
luck
that
guided
his
hand
to
the
back
of
her
skirt
hard
enough
to
leave
it
stinging
her
face
froze
and
she
stormed
out
a
moment
later
they
heard
the
tractor
start
off
but
doc
had
no
time
to
think
of
her
he
and
harkness
split
up
and
began
covering
the
streets
house
by
house
while
he
passed
on
the
word
to
abandon
the
metabolism
switch
and
go
back
to
jake
sent
two
other
doctors
to
relieve
them
late
in
the
evening
things
were
somewhat
quieter
at
ghq
as
doc
reported
the
events
at
marconi
where
dr
ryan
jake
asked
at
last
doc
exchanged
glances
with
harkness
she
is
in
the
lab
was
there
an
hour
ago
doc
cursed
himself
for
letting
her
go
with
the
knowledge
that
the
radio
in
the
mike
was
disabled
she
obviously
grabbed
the
first
chance
to
report
back
and
with
her
had
gone
news
of
the
only
cure
they
had
found
jake
took
it
as
philosophically
as
he
could
though
it
was
a
heavy
blow
to
his
hopes
they
spent
half
the
night
looking
for
her
tractor
on
the
chance
that
she
might
have
gotten
lost
or
broken
down
but
there
was
no
sign
of
it
she
was
waiting
in
the
laboratory
when
he
returned
at
dawn
her
face
was
dirty
and
her
uniform
was
a
mess
but
she
was
smiling
she
got
up
to
greet
him
holding
out
two
large
bottles
infant
plasma
straight
from
southport
and
if
you
think
i
had
it
easy
lying
my
way
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
you
a
fool
dan
feldman
if
the
man
who
took
my
place
there
had
been
a
native
idiot
i
never
would
have
gotten
away
with
it
the
things
he
had
suspected
could
still
be
right
he
realized
she
could
have
reported
everything
to
the
lobby
it
was
a
better
explanation
than
her
vague
account
of
bullying
her
way
in
and
out
but
she
had
a
rough
drive
and
he
wanted
the
plasma
curiously
he
was
glad
to
have
her
back
with
him
he
reached
out
a
hand
for
the
bottles
she
put
the
bottle
on
the
table
and
grabbed
up
a
knife
not
so
fast
she
cried
her
eyes
were
blazing
now
dan
feldman
if
you
touch
those
bottles
until
you
crawled
across
the
floor
on
your
face
and
apologized
for
the
way
you
treated
me
the
last
few
days
cut
your
damned
heart
out
he
shook
his
head
chuckling
at
the
picture
she
made
there
were
times
when
he
could
almost
see
why
he
married
her
all
right
chris
he
gave
in
i
be
darned
if
i
crawl
but
you
earned
an
apology
okay
she
sighed
uncertainly
then
she
nodded
and
began
changing
for
work
xiv
immunity
they
worked
through
the
day
in
what
seemed
to
be
armed
truce
there
was
no
coffee
waiting
for
him
when
he
awoke
next
as
he
come
to
expect
but
he
did
comment
he
went
to
where
she
was
already
working
checking
on
the
results
of
the
plasma
on
the
cultures
the
response
had
been
slower
than
with
the
mouse
blood
but
now
the
bugs
seemed
to
be
dead
the
filaments
were
destroyed
and
there
were
no
signs
of
the
big
cells
it
seemed
to
be
a
cure
at
least
in
the
culture
bottles
we
need
volunteers
he
decided
there
should
be
animals
but
we
do
have
any
at
least
this
stuff
is
toxic
we
need
a
natural
immune
and
someone
infected
two
of
each
so
one
can
be
treated
and
the
other
used
for
a
control
makes
four
not
enough
to
be
sure
but
it
will
have
to
do
two
chris
corrected
you
not
infected
i
am
two
others
he
agreed
i
get
them
from
jake
most
of
ghq
was
out
on
the
street
but
doc
found
jake
inside
the
big
schoolroom
where
he
enjoyed
his
early
morning
bracky
and
coffee
the
chief
listened
and
agreed
at
once
turning
to
the
others
in
the
room
who
had
the
jumping
headache
okay
swanee
who
never
had
it
he
blinked
in
surprise
as
three
men
nodded
out
of
the
eight
present
i
guess
you
go
tom
the
two
men
stood
up
tamping
out
their
weeds
and
went
out
with
doc
chris
had
everything
set
up
they
matched
coins
to
decide
who
would
be
treated
doc
noticed
that
chris
would
get
no
plasma
while
he
was
scheduled
for
everything
he
watched
her
prepare
the
culture
and
add
the
accelerator
that
would
speed
development
and
make
certain
he
and
tom
were
infected
then
let
her
inject
it
that
was
all
except
for
the
waiting
to
keep
conditions
more
closely
alike
they
were
to
stay
there
until
the
tests
were
finished
not
even
eating
for
fear
of
upsetting
the
conditions
swanee
dug
out
a
pack
of
worn
cards
and
began
to
deal
while
doc
dug
out
some
large
pills
to
use
as
chips
it
was
an
hour
later
when
the
pain
began
doc
had
just
won
the
pot
of
fifty
pills
and
opened
his
mouth
for
the
expected
gloating
he
yelled
as
an
explosion
seemed
to
go
off
inside
his
head
even
closing
his
mouth
was
agony
a
moment
later
tom
began
to
sweat
it
got
worse
spreading
to
the
whole
area
of
the
back
of
the
head
and
neck
doc
lay
on
the
cot
envying
chris
and
swanee
who
had
already
been
infected
naturally
he
longed
desperately
for
bracky
and
had
to
keep
reminding
himself
that
no
drugs
must
upset
the
tests
it
was
the
longest
day
he
had
ever
spent
and
he
began
to
doubt
that
he
could
get
through
it
he
watched
the
little
clock
move
from
one
minute
to
nine
over
to
half
a
minute
and
hung
breathless
until
it
hit
the
nine
there
was
no
question
about
whether
the
infection
had
taken
now
they
could
dull
the
agony
chris
had
the
anodyne
tablets
already
dissolved
in
water
and
swanee
was
passing
out
three
lighted
bracky
weeds
it
took
a
few
minutes
for
the
relief
of
the
anodyne
and
even
that
could
kill
all
the
pain
but
it
did
matter
by
comparison
he
sucked
the
weed
mashed
it
out
and
began
dealing
the
cards
again
they
had
a
plentiful
supply
of
the
anodyne
and
used
it
liberally
during
the
night
the
test
was
a
simulation
of
the
natural
course
of
the
disease
where
painkiller
would
take
time
to
get
for
most
people
here
but
would
then
be
used
generously
precisely
at
nine
in
the
morning
chris
began
to
inject
swanee
and
doc
with
plasma
now
there
was
no
thought
of
cards
they
waited
trying
to
talk
but
with
most
of
their
attention
on
the
clock
doc
had
estimated
that
an
hour
should
be
enough
to
show
results
but
it
was
hard
to
remember
that
an
hour
was
the
guess
as
to
the
minimum
time
he
winced
as
chris
took
a
tiny
bit
of
flesh
from
his
neck
she
went
to
the
other
men
and
then
submitted
to
his
work
on
herself
then
she
began
preparing
the
slides
feldman
she
read
the
name
of
the
slide
as
she
inserted
it
into
the
microscope
then
her
breath
caught
sharply
only
dead
cells
it
was
the
same
for
swanee
and
tom
each
had
to
look
at
his
own
slide
and
have
it
explained
before
the
results
could
be
believed
but
at
last
chris
bent
over
her
own
slide
a
minute
later
she
glanced
up
nodding
what
it
should
be
it
checks
tom
whooped
and
went
out
the
door
to
notify
jake
there
was
only
plasma
for
some
two
hundred
injections
but
that
should
yield
sufficient
proof
once
salvation
was
offered
there
should
be
no
trouble
convincing
the
people
that
blood
donations
from
their
children
were
worthwhile
later
when
the
last
of
the
plasma
had
been
used
they
could
finally
relax
chris
slipped
off
her
smock
and
dropped
onto
the
cot
a
tired
smile
came
onto
her
lips
you
forgiven
dan
she
said
a
moment
later
she
was
obviously
asleep
doc
meant
to
join
her
but
it
was
too
much
effort
he
leaned
his
head
forward
onto
his
arms
vaguely
wondering
why
she
was
calling
off
the
feud
it
was
night
outside
when
he
awoke
and
he
was
lying
on
the
cot
though
he
still
felt
cramped
and
strained
he
stirred
groaning
and
finally
realized
that
a
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
shaking
him
he
looked
up
to
see
jake
above
him
chris
was
busy
with
the
coffee
maker
jake
slumped
onto
the
cot
beside
doc
we
took
southport
he
announced
that
knocked
the
sleep
out
of
doc
system
you
what
we
took
it
lock
stock
and
barrel
i
figured
the
news
of
your
cure
would
put
guts
into
the
men
and
it
did
but
we
probably
have
taken
it
anyhow
there
was
anything
to
fight
for
there
after
earth
pulled
out
and
the
plague
really
hit
wilson
mistook
panic
for
fighting
spirit
the
poor
devils
did
have
anything
to
fight
about
once
the
lobby
stopped
goading
them
doc
tried
to
assimilate
the
news
but
once
the
surprise
was
gone
he
found
it
meant
very
little
maybe
his
revolutionary
zeal
had
cooled
once
the
lobby
men
had
pulled
out
we
need
a
lot
more
plasma
than
there
is
in
southport
he
said
not
so
much
maybe
jake
denied
doc
three
of
the
men
you
injected
were
shot
down
as
runners
your
plasma
no
good
it
takes
time
to
work
jake
i
told
you
there
might
be
a
case
or
two
that
would
be
too
close
to
the
edge
three
is
more
than
i
expected
but
it
not
impossible
there
was
plenty
of
time
they
blew
after
we
got
back
from
southport
jack
dropped
his
hand
on
doc
shoulder
and
his
face
softened
harkness
tested
every
man
you
injected
he
finished
half
an
hour
ago
five
showed
dead
bugs
the
rest
of
them
were
helped
at
all
doc
fumbled
for
a
weed
trying
to
think
but
his
thoughts
refused
to
focus
five
five
out
of
two
hundred
that
about
average
and
what
about
tom
he
was
jumping
around
after
the
test
last
night
telling
how
you
cured
him
how
he
seen
the
dead
bugs
but
he
never
had
the
jumping
headache
and
you
never
gave
him
the
plasma
he
got
dead
bugs
though
harkness
tested
him
doc
let
his
realization
of
his
own
idiocy
sink
in
until
he
could
believe
it
jake
was
right
tom
had
never
been
treated
yet
chris
had
reported
dead
bugs
they
all
been
so
ready
to
believe
in
miracles
that
no
one
had
been
able
to
think
straight
after
the
long
wait
there
was
a
bump
on
his
neck
a
small
one
he
said
slowly
jake
he
must
have
caught
it
even
if
he
seemed
immune
if
he
was
taking
anodyne
anyway
for
something
or
unconscious
he
was
up
in
northport
six
years
ago
for
a
kidney
operation
jake
admitted
doubtfully
we
had
to
chip
in
to
pay
for
it
but
you
still
did
treat
him
and
he
cured
face
it
doc
that
plasma
is
no
good
inside
the
body
his
hand
tightened
on
doc
shoulder
again
we
not
blaming
you
we
do
judge
a
man
here
except
by
what
he
is
maybe
the
stuff
helps
a
little
we
go
on
using
it
when
we
get
it
tell
everybody
you
were
a
mite
optimistic
so
they
figure
it
a
gamble
but
have
a
little
hope
left
and
you
keep
trying
something
cured
it
in
tom
now
you
find
out
what
doc
watched
him
go
out
numbly
and
turned
to
chris
it
ca
be
right
she
said
shakily
you
and
swanee
were
cured
maybe
it
was
the
accelerator
it
had
to
be
something
you
did
have
the
accelerator
he
accused
no
and
i
still
got
live
bugs
i
was
never
supposed
to
be
cured
so
i
expected
to
see
just
what
i
saw
how
i
missed
the
fact
that
tom
should
have
been
like
me
i
do
know
damn
it
oh
damn
it
he
never
seen
her
cry
before
except
in
fury
but
she
mastered
it
almost
at
once
shaking
tears
out
of
her
eyes
all
right
plasma
works
in
a
bottle
but
not
in
an
adult
body
maybe
something
works
in
the
body
but
not
in
a
bottle
maybe
and
maybe
some
people
are
just
naturally
immune
after
it
reaches
a
certain
stage
maybe
we
ran
into
coincidence
but
he
did
believe
that
any
more
than
she
did
the
answer
had
to
be
in
the
room
he
taken
a
massive
dose
of
the
disease
and
been
cured
in
a
few
hours
outside
the
room
the
war
went
on
drawing
toward
a
close
the
supposed
partial
cure
was
good
propaganda
if
nothing
else
and
jake
was
widening
his
territory
steadily
there
was
only
token
resistance
against
him
he
had
the
southport
shuttles
now
to
cover
huge
areas
in
a
hurry
but
inside
the
room
the
battle
was
less
successful
it
was
the
accelerator
it
was
the
tablets
of
anodyne
they
even
tried
sweeping
the
floor
and
using
the
dust
without
results
then
another
test
in
the
room
made
with
four
volunteers
jake
selected
yielded
complete
cures
after
injections
with
plain
salt
water
in
place
of
plasma
the
plague
speeded
up
again
about
four
people
out
of
a
hundred
now
seemed
to
have
caught
the
disease
and
cured
themselves
they
accounted
for
what
faith
was
left
in
doc
plasma
and
gave
some
unfounded
hope
to
the
others
northport
fell
a
week
later
putting
the
whole
planet
in
rebel
hands
jake
returned
wearier
than
ever
he
proved
to
be
one
of
the
natural
immunes
but
the
weight
of
the
campaign
that
could
only
end
in
a
defeat
by
the
plague
left
him
no
room
to
rejoice
in
his
personal
fortune
this
time
he
looked
completely
defeated
and
a
moment
later
doc
saw
why
as
jake
flipped
a
flimsy
sheet
onto
the
table
it
bore
the
seals
of
space
and
medical
lobbies
jake
pointed
upwards
the
war
rockets
are
there
all
right
we
knew
they
come
now
all
they
want
for
calling
them
off
is
our
surrender
and
your
cure
if
they
do
get
both
they
blow
the
planet
to
bits
we
have
two
days
the
rockets
could
be
seen
clearly
with
binoculars
there
were
more
than
enough
to
destroy
all
life
on
the
planet
maybe
they
be
used
eventually
anyhow
since
the
lobbies
wanted
no
more
rebellion
but
with
a
cure
for
the
plague
he
might
have
bought
them
off
chris
stood
beside
him
looking
as
if
it
were
a
bitter
pill
for
her
too
she
risked
herself
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
had
cooperated
with
him
in
everything
she
been
taught
to
oppose
and
had
worked
like
a
dog
now
the
lobbies
seemed
to
forget
her
as
a
useless
tool
they
were
falling
back
on
a
raw
power
play
and
forgetting
any
earlier
schemes
maybe
they
hold
off
for
a
while
if
i
agreed
to
go
to
them
and
share
all
my
ideas
specimens
and
notes
he
said
at
last
do
you
think
your
lobby
would
settle
for
that
chris
i
do
know
dan
i
stopped
thinking
their
way
she
seemed
almost
apologetic
for
the
admission
he
dropped
an
arm
over
her
shoulder
and
turned
with
her
back
to
the
laboratory
okay
then
we
got
to
find
a
miracle
we
got
two
days
ahead
of
us
at
least
we
can
try
but
he
knew
he
was
lying
to
himself
there
was
anything
he
could
think
of
to
try
xv
decision
two
days
was
never
enough
time
for
a
miracle
doc
decided
as
he
packed
his
notes
into
a
small
bag
and
put
it
beside
his
bundle
of
personal
belongings
he
glanced
around
the
room
for
the
last
time
and
managed
a
grin
at
jake
gloomy
expression
maybe
i
can
bluff
them
or
maybe
they
string
along
for
a
while
he
said
anyhow
now
that
they
agreed
to
take
me
and
my
notes
in
place
of
the
cure
we
fresh
out
of
i
got
to
be
on
that
shuttle
when
it
goes
back
to
their
men
at
orbital
station
jake
nodded
i
do
like
selling
friends
down
the
river
doc
but
it
would
do
you
any
more
good
to
blow
up
with
the
planet
i
reckon
they
wo
call
off
the
war
rockets
when
they
do
get
you
of
course
but
maybe
they
wo
use
them
except
as
a
threat
to
put
the
lobbies
back
in
stronger
than
ever
he
stuck
out
one
of
his
awkwardly
shaped
hands
clapped
the
aspirator
over
his
face
and
hurried
out
doc
picked
up
his
bags
and
went
toward
the
little
tractor
where
lou
was
waiting
to
drive
him
and
chris
back
toward
southport
and
the
shuttle
rocket
that
would
be
landing
for
them
they
had
mentioned
chris
in
their
demands
but
her
father
must
expect
her
to
return
after
they
had
him
he
be
on
his
own
his
best
course
was
probably
to
insist
on
talking
only
to
ryan
at
medical
lobby
and
then
being
completely
honest
the
room
here
would
be
kept
sealed
in
case
the
lobby
wanted
to
investigate
where
he
had
failed
and
his
notes
were
honest
which
was
something
that
could
usually
be
determined
chris
could
testify
to
that
anyhow
since
she
kept
a
lot
of
them
for
him
at
best
there
would
be
a
chance
for
some
compromise
and
perhaps
some
clue
for
them
that
might
eventually
end
the
plague
they
had
enough
men
to
work
on
it
and
billions
in
equipment
at
worst
he
should
gain
a
little
time
cheer
up
chris
he
told
her
as
he
climbed
through
the
little
airlock
maybe
harkness
will
turn
up
the
cure
before
our
negotiations
break
down
he
has
the
whole
of
northport
hospital
to
play
with
they
tried
to
chase
him
out
of
there
yet
after
all
we
almost
found
something
with
no
equipment
except
wild
imaginations
she
shook
her
head
as
the
tractor
began
moving
shut
up
i
got
enough
trouble
without
your
coming
down
with
logorrhea
do
be
a
fool
why
change
now
he
asked
her
everything
i
done
has
been
because
i
am
a
fool
i
guess
my
luck
lasted
longer
than
i
could
expect
and
still
fool
enough
to
think
that
the
solution
has
to
turn
up
eventually
we
know
it
has
to
be
in
that
room
damn
it
we
must
know
it
if
we
could
only
think
straight
now
she
reached
over
and
touched
his
hand
but
made
no
comment
they
had
been
over
that
statement
of
desperation
too
many
times
already
but
it
kept
nagging
at
him
something
in
the
room
something
in
the
room
something
so
common
that
nobody
noticed
it
they
passed
a
crowd
chasing
down
a
runner
something
in
that
room
could
have
saved
the
unlucky
man
it
could
have
saved
mars
perhaps
he
growled
for
the
hundredth
time
cursing
his
mind
too
little
sleep
too
much
coffee
and
bracky
he
reached
for
the
package
of
weed
realizing
that
he
would
miss
it
on
earth
if
he
ever
got
there
like
everything
here
on
the
planet
begun
by
detesting
it
and
wound
up
finding
it
the
thing
he
wanted
to
keep
forever
he
lighted
the
bracky
and
sat
smoking
watching
lou
drive
when
the
first
was
finished
he
lighted
another
from
the
butt
she
put
out
a
hand
and
took
it
away
please
dan
i
can
stand
the
stuff
but
i
never
like
it
and
the
tractor
stuffy
enough
already
i
taken
enough
of
it
and
it
keeps
reminding
me
of
our
test
the
three
of
you
stinking
up
the
place
puffing
and
blowing
that
out
while
i
could
even
get
a
breath
of
air
she
was
getting
logorrhea
herself
now
and
the
answer
finally
hit
him
he
jerked
around
making
a
grab
for
shoulder
motioning
for
the
man
to
head
back
bracky
it
has
to
be
chris
that
it
jake
picked
out
the
second
group
of
men
from
his
friends
and
they
are
all
cronies
because
they
hang
around
so
much
in
their
smoking
room
the
first
time
it
killed
the
bugs
for
all
of
us
who
smoked
and
it
did
work
for
you
because
you
never
learned
the
habit
lou
had
the
tractor
turned
and
the
rheostat
all
the
way
to
the
floor
she
was
sitting
up
now
but
she
was
fully
satisfied
the
percentage
of
immunes
seems
about
right
but
why
do
some
of
the
smokers
get
the
disease
while
some
do
why
not
it
depends
on
whether
they
pick
up
the
habit
before
or
after
the
disease
gets
started
tom
must
have
got
his
while
he
was
in
northport
they
would
let
him
smoke
there
if
he
had
the
habit
before
for
that
matter
she
found
no
fault
with
that
he
twisted
it
back
and
forth
in
his
mind
trying
to
find
a
fault
there
seemed
to
be
none
the
only
trouble
was
that
they
could
send
a
message
that
bracky
was
the
cure
and
hope
that
earth
would
prove
it
true
no
polite
note
of
apology
would
do
after
that
they
had
to
be
sure
too
many
other
ideas
had
proved
wrong
already
jake
saw
them
coming
and
came
running
toward
the
laboratory
but
lou
stopped
the
tractor
before
it
reached
the
building
and
let
the
older
man
in
get
me
a
dozen
men
who
have
the
plague
i
want
the
worst
cases
you
have
and
ones
that
harkness
tested
himself
doc
ordered
and
then
start
praying
that
the
cure
we
got
works
fast
chris
was
at
the
electron
mike
at
once
but
one
of
her
hands
reached
out
for
the
weed
she
began
puffing
valiantly
making
sick
faces
now
other
men
began
coming
in
their
faces
struggling
to
find
hope
but
not
daring
to
believe
yet
jake
followed
them
we
test
at
intervals
that
will
be
about
two
hours
for
the
last
from
the
group
doc
decided
one
of
the
doctors
harkness
had
brought
to
the
villages
was
busy
cutting
tiny
sections
from
the
lumps
on
the
men
necks
while
chris
ran
them
through
the
microscope
to
make
sure
the
bugs
were
still
alive
the
regular
optical
mike
was
strong
enough
for
that
doc
handed
each
man
a
bracky
weed
with
instructions
to
keep
smoking
no
matter
how
sick
it
made
him
there
were
no
results
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
when
the
first
test
was
made
the
second
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
was
still
infected
with
live
bugs
at
the
chris
frowned
i
ca
be
sure
take
a
look
dan
he
bent
over
moving
the
slide
to
examine
another
spot
i
think
so
the
next
one
should
tell
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fourth
test
the
bugs
were
dead
without
a
single
exception
that
they
could
find
one
by
one
the
men
were
tested
and
went
storming
out
shouting
the
news
for
a
minute
the
gathering
crowd
was
skeptical
remembering
the
other
failures
then
abruptly
men
were
screaming
crying
and
fighting
for
the
precious
bracky
like
the
legions
of
the
damned
grabbing
for
lottery
tickets
when
the
prize
was
a
passport
to
paradise
jake
swore
as
he
moved
toward
the
door
we
low
on
bracky
here
have
to
get
a
supply
from
edison
i
guess
and
cart
it
to
the
shuttle
enough
for
a
sample
and
to
make
them
want
more
it
be
tough
but
we
get
it
there
in
time
by
the
time
the
shuttle
should
be
picking
you
up
doc
you
won
our
war
from
now
on
if
earth
wants
to
keep
her
population
up
we
be
a
free
planet
chris
turned
slowly
from
the
microscope
holding
a
slide
in
her
hands
my
bugs
she
said
unbelievingly
dan
they
dead
jake
patted
her
shoulder
that
makes
it
perfect
girl
now
come
on
we
got
to
start
celebrating
a
victory
it
was
the
general
feeling
of
most
of
the
heads
of
the
villages
when
they
met
the
next
day
in
southport
using
the
courtroom
that
had
been
presided
over
so
long
by
judge
ben
wilson
it
was
victory
and
to
the
victor
belonged
the
spoils
the
bracky
had
gone
out
to
earth
on
a
converted
war
rocket
that
could
make
the
trip
in
less
than
two
weeks
and
one
packet
had
been
specially
labeled
for
captain
everts
but
earth
had
already
confirmed
the
cure
the
small
amounts
of
the
herb
found
in
the
botanical
collections
had
been
enough
to
satisfy
all
doubts
harkness
chris
and
doc
had
been
fighting
against
the
desire
to
rob
earth
blind
that
filled
most
of
the
men
here
for
hours
now
now
they
had
the
backing
of
jake
and
ben
wilson
and
now
finally
they
leaned
back
sensing
that
the
argument
had
been
won
bargaining
was
all
right
in
its
place
but
it
had
no
place
in
affairs
of
life
and
death
such
as
this
they
had
to
see
that
earth
received
all
the
bracky
she
needed
it
was
only
right
to
charge
a
fair
price
for
it
but
they
could
restrict
it
by
withholding
or
overcharging
and
they
could
still
gain
their
ends
without
blackmail
martian
alkaloids
were
tricky
things
and
bracky
smoke
contained
a
number
of
them
it
would
take
earth
at
least
ten
years
to
discover
and
synthesize
the
right
one
and
it
would
still
probably
cost
more
than
it
would
to
import
the
weed
from
mars
as
long
as
the
source
of
that
weed
was
here
and
in
the
hands
of
the
colonials
there
would
be
no
danger
of
earth
bombing
the
planet
harkness
got
up
to
underscore
a
point
wilson
had
made
the
plague
lived
a
million
years
and
it
wo
disappear
now
the
jumping
headache
or
selznick
migraine
is
unpleasant
enough
to
make
us
reasonably
sure
that
there
will
be
a
steady
consumption
of
the
weed
our
problem
will
be
to
keep
the
children
from
using
too
much
of
it
probably
he
pulled
a
weed
out
and
lighted
it
puckering
his
face
as
the
smoke
bit
his
tongue
i
told
that
this
gets
to
be
an
enjoyable
habit
if
i
can
believe
that
surely
you
can
believe
me
when
i
say
we
do
have
to
bargain
with
lives
the
village
men
were
human
and
most
of
them
could
remember
the
strain
they
had
been
under
when
they
expected
those
they
loved
to
die
at
any
hour
it
had
made
them
crave
vengeance
but
now
as
they
had
a
chance
to
reexamine
it
they
began
to
find
it
harder
to
impose
the
horror
of
any
such
threat
on
others
the
final
vote
was
almost
unanimous
doc
listened
as
they
wrangled
over
the
wording
of
the
message
to
earth
feeling
disconnected
from
it
he
passed
chris
a
bracky
and
lighted
it
for
her
she
took
it
automatically
smiling
as
the
smoke
hit
her
lungs
it
was
one
thing
they
had
in
common
now
at
least
ben
wilson
finally
read
the
message
to
the
people
of
earth
greetings
on
behalf
of
the
free
people
of
mars
i
have
the
honor
to
announce
that
this
planet
hereby
declares
itself
a
sovereign
and
independent
world
we
shall
continue
to
regard
earth
as
our
mother
and
to
consider
the
health
and
welfare
of
her
people
in
no
way
second
to
our
own
in
matters
which
affect
both
planets
we
trust
that
earth
will
share
this
feeling
of
mutual
friendship
we
trust
that
all
strains
of
hostility
will
be
ended
the
advantages
to
each
from
peaceful
commerce
make
any
course
other
than
the
most
cordial
of
relations
unthinkable
we
shall
consider
proof
of
such
friendship
an
order
by
earth
to
all
rockets
circling
this
planet
that
they
shall
deliver
themselves
safely
into
our
hands
in
order
that
we
may
begin
converting
them
to
peaceful
purposes
for
the
trade
that
is
to
come
in
turn
we
pledge
that
all
efforts
will
be
made
to
ensure
a
prompt
delivery
of
those
products
most
in
demand
including
the
curative
bracky
plant
he
turned
to
doc
then
you
want
to
sign
it
feldman
make
it
as
acting
president
or
something
until
we
can
get
around
to
voting
you
into
permanent
office
you
and
jake
fight
over
the
job
doc
told
him
no
ben
i
mean
it
he
got
up
and
moved
out
into
the
outer
room
where
he
could
avoid
the
stares
of
amazement
that
were
turned
to
him
he
never
asked
for
the
honor
and
he
did
want
it
chris
came
with
him
her
face
was
shocked
and
something
was
slowly
draining
out
of
it
as
he
looked
at
her
forget
it
chris
he
said
you
going
back
to
earth
there
is
nothing
for
you
here
she
had
quite
given
up
there
could
be
dan
you
know
that
no
no
chris
i
do
think
there
ever
can
be
you
ca
find
a
man
strong
enough
to
rule
who
be
weak
enough
to
let
you
rule
in
his
place
it
did
work
on
earth
and
it
wo
work
here
forget
the
dreams
you
had
of
what
could
be
done
with
a
new
planet
those
are
the
dreams
that
made
a
mess
of
the
old
one
i
be
back
she
told
him
some
day
i
be
back
he
shook
his
head
again
no
you
would
like
what
you
find
here
freedom
is
heady
stuff
but
you
have
to
have
a
taste
for
it
you
acquire
a
fondness
for
it
secondhand
and
for
a
while
there
going
to
be
freedom
here
besides
once
you
get
back
to
earth
you
forget
what
happened
here
she
sighed
at
last
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
her
she
seemed
to
give
in
completely
and
for
that
brief
moment
he
loved
what
she
could
have
been
but
never
would
be
all
right
dan
she
said
quietly
i
ca
fight
you
i
never
could
i
see
now
i
take
the
rocket
back
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
had
bothered
to
think
but
he
knew
the
answer
research
what
else
there
would
be
a
lot
of
research
done
here
it
had
been
suppressed
too
long
and
had
piled
up
a
that
would
have
to
be
relieved
and
from
that
research
he
suspected
would
come
the
end
of
the
stable
oligarchy
of
earth
it
could
never
stand
against
the
changes
that
would
be
pouring
out
of
mars
she
put
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
and
moved
forward
to
kiss
him
he
bent
down
to
meet
her
and
found
her
eyes
were
wet
maybe
his
were
too
then
she
broke
free
you
a
fool
dan
feldman
she
whispered
and
began
moving
down
the
hallway
and
out
of
the
council
hall
of
mars
doc
feldman
nodded
slowly
as
he
let
her
go
he
was
a
fool
he
had
always
been
a
fool
and
always
would
be
and
that
was
why
he
could
never
take
over
leadership
here
fools
and
idealists
should
never
govern
a
world
it
took
practical
men
such
as
jake
to
do
that
but
the
practical
men
needed
the
foolish
idealists
too
and
maybe
for
a
time
here
on
mars
their
kind
of
men
and
his
kind
of
fools
could
make
one
more
stab
at
the
ancient
puzzle
of
freedom

the
