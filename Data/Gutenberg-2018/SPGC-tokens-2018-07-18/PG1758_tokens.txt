at
the
pines
near
rye
august
my
dear
sir
i
am
happy
to
assure
you
that
your
anxiety
is
without
reason
flemming
will
be
confined
to
the
sofa
for
three
or
four
weeks
and
will
have
to
be
careful
at
first
how
he
uses
his
leg
a
fracture
of
this
kind
is
always
a
tedious
affair
fortunately
the
bone
was
very
skilfully
set
by
the
surgeon
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
drugstore
where
flemming
was
brought
after
his
fall
and
i
apprehend
no
permanent
inconvenience
from
the
accident
flemming
is
doing
perfectly
well
physically
but
i
must
confess
that
the
irritable
and
morbid
state
of
mind
into
which
he
has
fallen
causes
me
a
great
deal
of
uneasiness
he
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
who
ought
to
break
his
leg
you
know
how
impetuous
our
friend
is
ordinarily
what
a
soul
of
restlessness
and
energy
never
content
unless
he
is
rushing
at
some
object
like
a
sportive
bull
at
a
red
shawl
but
amiable
withal
he
is
no
longer
amiable
his
temper
has
become
something
frightful
miss
fanny
flemming
came
up
from
newport
where
the
family
are
staying
for
the
summer
to
nurse
him
but
he
packed
her
off
the
next
morning
in
tears
he
has
a
complete
set
of
balzac
s
works
volumes
piled
up
near
his
sofa
to
throw
at
watkins
whenever
that
exemplary
appears
with
his
meals
yesterday
i
very
innocently
brought
flemming
a
small
basket
of
lemons
you
know
it
was
a
strip
of
on
the
curbstone
that
caused
our
friend
s
mischance
well
he
no
sooner
set
is
eyes
upon
those
lemons
than
he
fell
into
such
a
rage
as
i
can
not
adequately
describe
this
is
only
one
of
moods
and
the
least
distressing
at
other
times
he
sits
with
bowed
head
regarding
his
splintered
limb
silent
sullen
despairing
when
this
fit
is
on
him
and
it
sometimes
lasts
all
day
nothing
can
distract
his
melancholy
he
refuses
to
eat
does
not
even
read
the
newspapers
books
except
as
projectiles
for
watkins
have
no
charms
for
him
his
state
is
truly
pitiable
now
if
he
were
a
poor
man
with
a
family
depending
on
his
daily
labor
this
irritability
and
despondency
would
be
natural
enough
but
in
a
young
fellow
of
with
plenty
of
money
and
seemingly
not
a
care
in
the
world
the
thing
is
monstrous
if
he
continues
to
give
way
to
his
vagaries
in
this
manner
he
will
end
by
bringing
on
an
inflammation
of
the
fibula
it
was
the
fibula
he
broke
i
am
at
my
wits
end
to
know
what
to
prescribe
for
him
i
have
anaesthetics
and
lotions
to
make
people
sleep
and
to
soothe
pain
but
i
ve
no
medicine
that
will
make
a
man
have
a
little
that
is
beyond
my
skill
but
maybe
it
is
not
beyond
yours
you
are
flemming
s
intimate
friend
his
fidus
achates
write
to
him
write
to
him
frequently
distract
his
mind
cheer
him
up
and
prevent
him
from
becoming
a
confirmed
case
of
melancholia
perhaps
he
has
some
important
plans
disarranged
by
his
present
confinement
if
he
has
you
will
know
and
will
know
how
to
advise
him
judiciously
i
trust
your
father
finds
the
change
beneficial
i
am
my
dear
sir
with
great
respect
etc
ii
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
west
street
new
york
august
my
dear
jack
i
had
a
line
from
dillon
this
morning
and
was
rejoiced
to
learn
that
your
hurt
is
not
so
bad
as
reported
like
a
certain
personage
you
are
not
so
black
and
blue
as
you
are
painted
dillon
will
put
you
on
your
pins
again
in
two
to
three
weeks
if
you
will
only
have
patience
and
follow
his
counsels
did
you
get
my
note
of
last
wednesday
i
was
greatly
troubled
when
i
heard
of
the
accident
i
can
imagine
how
tranquil
and
saintly
you
are
with
your
leg
in
a
trough
it
is
deuced
awkward
to
be
sure
just
as
we
had
promised
ourselves
a
glorious
month
together
at
the
but
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
it
is
unfortunate
too
that
my
father
s
health
renders
it
impossible
for
me
to
leave
him
i
think
he
has
much
improved
the
sea
air
is
his
native
element
but
he
still
needs
my
arm
to
lean
upon
in
his
walks
and
requires
some
one
more
careful
that
a
servant
to
look
after
him
i
can
not
come
to
you
dear
jack
but
i
have
hours
of
unemployed
time
on
hand
and
i
will
write
you
a
whole
full
of
letters
if
that
will
divert
you
heaven
knows
i
haven
t
anything
to
write
about
it
isn
t
as
if
we
were
living
at
one
of
the
beach
houses
then
i
could
do
you
some
character
studies
and
fill
your
imagination
with
groups
of
with
their
or
somebody
else
s
raven
and
blonde
manes
hanging
down
their
shoulders
you
should
have
aphrodite
in
morning
wrapper
in
evening
costume
and
in
her
prettiest
bathing
suit
but
we
are
far
from
all
that
here
we
have
rooms
in
a
on
a
two
miles
from
the
hotels
and
lead
the
quietest
of
lives
i
wish
i
were
a
novelist
this
old
house
with
its
sanded
floors
and
high
wainscots
and
its
narrow
windows
looking
out
upon
a
cluster
of
pines
that
turn
themselves
into
aeolian
harps
every
time
the
wind
blows
would
be
the
place
in
which
to
write
a
summer
romance
it
should
be
a
story
with
the
odors
of
the
forest
and
the
breath
of
the
sea
in
it
it
should
be
a
novel
like
one
of
that
russian
fellow
s
what
s
his
name
tourguenieff
turguenef
turgenif
toorguniff
turgenjew
nobody
knows
how
to
spell
him
yet
i
wonder
if
even
a
liza
or
an
alexandra
paulovna
could
stir
the
heart
of
a
man
who
has
constant
twinges
in
his
leg
i
wonder
if
one
of
our
own
yankee
girls
of
the
best
type
haughty
and
spirituelle
would
be
of
any
comfort
to
you
in
your
present
deplorable
condition
if
i
thought
so
i
would
hasten
down
to
the
surf
house
and
catch
one
for
you
or
better
still
i
would
find
you
one
over
the
way
picture
to
yourself
a
large
white
house
just
across
the
road
nearly
opposite
our
cottage
it
is
not
a
house
but
a
mansion
built
perhaps
in
the
colonial
period
with
rambling
extensions
and
gambrel
roof
and
a
wide
piazza
on
three
sides
a
piece
of
architecture
with
its
nose
in
the
air
it
stands
back
from
the
road
and
has
an
obsequious
retinue
of
fringed
elms
and
oaks
and
weeping
willows
sometimes
in
the
morning
and
oftener
in
the
afternoon
when
the
sun
has
withdrawn
from
that
part
of
the
mansions
a
young
woman
appears
on
the
piazza
with
some
mysterious
penelope
web
of
embroidery
in
her
hand
or
a
book
there
is
a
hammock
over
there
of
pineapple
fibre
it
looks
from
here
a
hammock
is
very
becoming
when
one
is
eighteen
and
has
golden
hair
and
dark
eyes
and
an
illusion
dress
looped
up
after
the
fashion
of
a
dresden
china
shepherdess
and
is
chaussee
like
a
belle
of
the
time
of
louis
quatorze
all
this
splendor
goes
into
that
hammock
and
sways
there
like
a
in
the
golden
afternoon
the
window
of
my
bedroom
looks
down
on
that
piazza
and
so
do
i
but
enough
of
the
nonsense
which
ill
becomes
a
sedate
young
attorney
taking
his
vacation
with
an
invalid
father
drop
me
a
line
dear
jack
and
tell
me
how
you
really
are
state
your
case
write
me
a
long
quite
letter
if
you
are
violent
or
abusive
i
ll
take
the
law
to
you
iii
john
flemming
to
edward
delaney
august
your
letter
dear
ned
was
a
godsend
fancy
what
a
fix
i
am
in
i
who
never
had
a
day
s
sickness
since
i
was
born
my
left
leg
weighs
three
tons
it
is
embalmed
in
spices
and
smothered
in
layers
of
fine
linen
like
a
mummy
i
can
t
move
i
haven
t
moved
for
five
thousand
years
i
m
of
the
time
of
pharaoh
i
lie
from
morning
till
night
on
a
lounge
staring
into
the
hot
street
everybody
is
out
of
town
enjoying
himself
the
houses
across
the
street
resemble
a
row
of
particularly
ugly
coffins
set
up
on
end
a
green
mould
is
settling
on
the
names
of
the
deceased
carved
on
the
silver
sardonic
spiders
have
sewed
up
the
all
is
silence
and
dust
and
i
interrupt
this
a
moment
to
take
a
shy
at
watkins
with
the
second
volume
of
cesar
birotteau
missed
him
i
think
i
could
bring
him
down
with
a
copy
of
or
the
dictionnaire
universel
if
i
had
it
these
small
balzac
books
somehow
do
not
quite
fit
my
hand
but
i
shall
fetch
him
yet
i
ve
an
idea
that
watkins
is
tapping
the
old
gentleman
s
chateau
yquem
duplicate
key
of
the
hibernian
swarries
in
the
front
basement
young
cheops
up
stairs
snug
in
his
cerements
watkins
glides
into
my
chamber
with
that
colorless
hypocritical
face
of
his
drawn
out
long
like
an
accordion
but
i
know
he
grins
all
the
way
down
stairs
and
is
glad
i
have
broken
my
leg
was
not
my
evil
star
in
the
very
zenith
when
i
ran
up
to
town
to
attend
that
dinner
at
delmonico
s
i
didn
t
come
up
altogether
for
that
it
was
partly
to
buy
frank
livingstone
s
roan
mare
margot
and
now
i
shall
not
be
able
to
sit
in
the
saddle
these
two
months
i
ll
send
the
mare
down
to
you
at
the
pines
is
that
the
name
of
the
place
old
dillon
fancies
that
i
have
something
on
my
mind
he
drives
me
wild
with
lemons
lemons
for
a
mind
diseased
nonsense
i
am
only
as
restless
as
the
devil
under
this
confinement
a
thing
i
m
not
used
to
take
a
man
who
has
never
had
so
much
as
a
headache
or
a
toothache
in
his
life
strap
one
of
his
legs
in
a
section
of
keep
him
in
a
room
in
the
city
for
weeks
with
the
hot
weather
turned
on
and
then
expect
him
to
smile
and
purr
and
be
happy
it
is
preposterous
i
can
t
be
cheerful
or
calm
your
letter
is
the
first
consoling
thing
i
have
had
since
my
disaster
ten
days
ago
it
really
cheered
me
up
for
half
an
hour
send
me
a
screed
ned
as
often
as
you
can
if
you
love
me
anything
will
do
write
me
more
about
that
little
girl
in
the
hammock
that
was
very
pretty
all
that
about
the
dresden
china
shepherdess
and
the
the
imagery
a
little
mixed
perhaps
but
very
pretty
i
didn
t
suppose
you
had
so
much
sentimental
furniture
in
your
upper
story
it
shows
how
one
may
be
familiar
for
years
with
the
of
his
neighbor
and
never
suspect
what
is
directly
under
his
mansard
i
supposed
your
loft
stuffed
with
dry
legal
parchments
mortgages
and
affidavits
you
take
down
a
package
of
manuscript
and
lo
there
are
lyrics
and
sonnets
and
canzonettas
you
really
have
a
graphic
descriptive
touch
edward
delaney
and
i
suspect
you
of
anonymous
in
the
magazines
i
shall
be
a
bear
until
i
hear
from
you
again
tell
me
all
about
your
pretty
inconnue
across
the
road
what
is
her
name
who
is
she
who
s
her
father
where
s
her
mother
who
s
her
lover
you
can
not
imagine
how
this
will
occupy
me
the
more
trifling
the
better
my
imprisonment
has
weakened
me
intellectually
to
such
a
degree
that
i
find
your
epistolary
gifts
quite
considerable
i
am
passing
into
my
second
childhood
in
a
week
or
two
i
shall
take
to
india
rubber
rings
and
prongs
of
coral
a
silver
cup
with
an
appropriate
inscription
would
be
a
delicate
attention
on
your
part
in
the
mean
time
write
iv
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
the
sick
pasha
shall
be
amused
bismillah
he
wills
it
so
if
the
becomes
prolix
and
tedious
the
and
the
sack
and
two
nubians
to
drop
him
into
the
piscataqua
but
truly
jack
i
have
a
hard
task
there
is
literally
nothing
here
except
the
little
girl
over
the
way
she
is
swinging
in
the
hammock
at
this
moment
it
is
to
me
compensation
for
many
of
the
ills
of
life
to
see
her
now
and
then
put
out
a
small
kid
boot
which
fits
like
a
glove
and
set
herself
going
who
is
she
and
what
is
her
name
her
name
is
daw
only
daughter

baltimore
and
washington
the
new
england
winter
too
many
for
the
old
gentleman
the
daughter
is
called
marjorie
marjorie
daw
sounds
odd
at
first
doesn
t
it
but
after
you
say
it
over
to
yourself
half
a
dozen
times
you
like
it
there
s
a
pleasing
quaintness
to
it
something
prim
and
must
be
a
nice
sort
of
girl
to
be
called
marjorie
daw
i
had
mine
host
of
the
pines
in
the
last
night
and
drew
the
foregoing
testimony
from
him

charge
of

known

thirty
years
of
course

of
my
walks

young
lady
has
a
favorite
path
to
the

shall
intercept
her
some
morning
and
touch
my
hat
to
her
then
the
princess
will
bend
her
fair
head
to
me
with
courteous
surprise
not
unmixed
with
haughtiness
will
snub
me
in
fact
all
this
for
thy
sake
o
pasha
of
the
snapt
how
oddly
things
fall
out
ten
minutes
ago
i
was
called
down
to
the
parlor
you
know
the
kind
of
parlors
in
on
the
coast
a
sort
of
amphibious
parlor
with
on
the
and
spruce
branches
in
the
where
i
found
my
father
and
daw
doing
the
antique
polite
to
each
other
he
had
come
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
new
neighbors
daw
is
a
tall
slim
gentleman
of
about
with
a
florid
face
and
mustache
and
looks
like
dombey
or
as
dombey
would
have
looked
if
he
had
served
a
few
years
in
the
british
army
daw
was
a
colonel
in
the
late
war
commanding
the
regiment
in
which
his
son
was
a
lieutenant
plucky
old
boy
backbone
of
new
hampshire
granite
before
taking
his
leave
the
colonel
delivered
himself
of
an
invitation
as
if
he
were
issuing
a
general
order
miss
daw
has
a
few
friends
coming
at
to
play
croquet
on
the
lawn
and
have
tea
cold
rations
on
the
piazza
will
we
honor
them
with
our
company
or
be
sent
to

my
father

the
plea
of
my
father

son

with
as
much
suavity
as
he
knows
and
accepts
in
my
next
i
shall
have
something
to
tell
you
i
shall
have
seen
the
little
beauty
face
to
face
i
have
a
presentiment
jack
that
this
daw
is
a
rara
avis
keep
up
your
spirits
my
boy
until
i
write
you
another
letter
and
send
me
along
word
how
s
your
leg
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
the
party
my
dear
jack
was
as
dreary
as
possible
a
lieutenant
of
the
navy
the
rector
of
the
episcopal
church
at
stillwater
and
a
society
swell
from
nahant
the
lieutenant
looked
as
if
he
had
swallowed
a
couple
of
his
buttons
and
found
the
bullion
rather
indigestible
the
rector
was
a
pensive
youth
of
the
daffydowndilly
sort
and
the
swell
from
nahant
was
a
very
weak
tidal
wave
indeed
the
women
were
much
better
as
they
always
are
the
two
miss
kingsburys
of
philadelphia
staying
at
the
seashell
house
two
bright
and
engaging
girls
but
marjorie
daw
the
company
broke
up
soon
after
tea
and
i
remained
to
smoke
a
cigar
with
the
colonel
on
the
piazza
it
was
like
seeing
a
picture
to
see
miss
marjorie
hovering
around
the
old
soldier
and
doing
a
hundred
gracious
little
things
for
him
she
brought
the
cigars
and
lighted
the
tapers
with
her
own
delicate
fingers
in
the
most
enchanting
fashion
as
we
sat
there
she
came
and
went
in
the
summer
twilight
and
seemed
with
her
white
dress
and
pale
gold
hair
like
some
lovely
phantom
that
had
sprung
into
existence
out
of
the
if
she
had
melted
into
air
like
the
statue
of
galatea
in
the
play
i
should
have
been
more
sorry
than
surprised
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
the
old
colonel
worshipped
her
and
she
him
i
think
the
relation
between
an
elderly
father
and
a
daughter
just
blooming
into
womanhood
the
most
beautiful
possible
there
is
in
it
a
subtile
sentiment
that
can
not
exist
in
the
case
of
mother
and
daughter
or
that
of
son
and
mother
but
this
is
getting
into
deep
water
i
sat
with
the
daws
until
half
past
ten
and
saw
the
moon
rise
on
the
sea
the
ocean
that
had
stretched
motionless
and
black
against
the
horizon
was
changed
by
magic
into
a
broken
field
of
glittering
ice
interspersed
with
marvellous
silvery
fjords
in
the
far
distance
the
isle
of
shoals
loomed
up
like
a
group
of
huge
bergs
drifting
down
on
us
the
polar
regions
in
a
june
thaw
it
was
exceedingly
fine
what
did
we
talk
about
we
talked
about
the
weather
and
you
the
weather
has
been
disagreeable
for
several
days
past
and
so
have
you
i
glided
from
one
topic
to
the
other
very
naturally
i
told
my
friends
of
your
accident
how
it
had
frustrated
all
our
summer
plans
and
what
our
plans
were
i
played
quite
a
spirited
solo
on
the
fibula
then
i
described
you
or
rather
i
didn
t
i
spoke
of
your
amiability
of
your
patience
under
this
severe
affliction
of
your
touching
gratitude
when
dillon
brings
you
little
presents
of
fruit
of
your
tenderness
to
your
sister
fanny
whom
you
would
not
allow
to
stay
in
town
to
nurse
you
and
how
you
heroically
sent
her
back
to
newport
preferring
to
remain
alone
with
mary
the
cook
and
your
man
watkins
to
whom
by
the
way
you
were
devotedly
attached
if
you
had
been
there
jack
you
wouldn
t
have
known
yourself
i
should
have
excelled
as
a
criminal
lawyer
if
i
had
not
turned
my
attention
to
a
different
branch
of
jurisprudence
miss
marjorie
asked
all
manner
of
leading
questions
concerning
you
it
did
not
occur
to
me
then
but
it
struck
me
forcibly
afterwards
that
she
evinced
a
singular
interest
in
the
conversation
when
i
got
back
to
my
room
i
recalled
how
eagerly
she
leaned
forward
with
her
full
snowy
throat
in
strong
moonlight
listening
to
what
i
said
positively
i
think
i
made
her
like
you
miss
daw
is
a
girl
whom
you
would
like
immensely
i
can
tell
you
that
a
beauty
without
affectation
a
high
and
tender
nature
if
one
can
read
the
soul
in
the
face
and
the
old
colonel
is
a
noble
character
too
i
am
glad
that
the
daws
are
such
pleasant
people
the
pines
is
an
isolated
spot
and
my
resources
are
few
i
fear
i
should
have
found
life
here
somewhat
monotonous
before
long
with
no
other
society
than
that
of
my
excellent
sire
it
is
true
i
might
have
made
a
target
of
the
defenceless
invalid
but
i
haven
t
a
taste
for
artillery
moi
vi
john
flemming
to
edward
delaney
august
for
a
man
who
hasn
t
a
taste
for
artillery
it
occurs
to
me
my
friend
you
are
keeping
up
a
pretty
lively
fire
on
my
inner
works
but
go
on
cynicism
is
a
small
brass
that
eventually
bursts
and
kills
the
artilleryman
you
may
abuse
me
as
much
as
you
like
and
i
ll
not
complain
for
i
don
t
know
what
i
should
do
without
your
letters
they
are
curing
me
i
haven
t
hurled
anything
at
watkins
since
last
sunday
partly
because
i
have
grown
more
amiable
under
your
teaching
and
partly
because
watkins
captured
my
ammunition
one
night
and
carried
it
off
to
the
library
he
is
rapidly
losing
the
habit
he
had
acquired
of
dodging
whenever
i
rub
my
ear
or
make
any
slight
motion
with
my
right
arm
he
is
still
suggestive
of
the
however
you
may
break
you
may
shatter
watkins
if
you
will
but
the
scent
of
the
roederer
will
hang
round
him
still
ned
that
miss
daw
must
be
a
charming
person
i
should
certainly
like
her
i
like
her
already
when
you
spoke
in
your
first
letter
of
seeing
a
young
girl
swinging
in
a
hammock
under
your
chamber
window
i
was
somehow
strangely
drawn
to
her
i
can
not
account
for
it
in
the
least
what
you
have
subsequently
written
of
miss
daw
has
strengthened
the
impression
you
seem
to
be
describing
a
woman
i
have
known
in
some
previous
state
of
existence
or
dreamed
of
in
this
upon
my
word
if
you
were
to
send
me
her
photograph
i
believe
i
should
recognize
her
at
a
glance
her
manner
that
listening
attitude
her
traits
of
character
as
you
indicate
them
the
light
hair
and
the
dark
eyes
they
are
all
familiar
things
to
me
asked
a
lot
of
questions
did
she
curious
about
me
that
is
strange
you
would
laugh
in
your
sleeve
you
wretched
old
cynic
if
you
knew
how
i
lie
awake
nights
with
my
gas
turned
down
to
a
star
thinking
of
the
pines
and
the
house
across
the
road
how
cool
it
must
be
down
there
i
long
for
the
salt
smell
in
the
air
i
picture
the
colonel
smoking
his
cheroot
on
the
piazza
i
send
you
and
miss
daw
off
on
afternoon
rambles
along
the
beach
sometimes
i
let
you
stroll
with
her
under
the
elms
in
the
moonlight
for
you
are
great
friends
by
this
time
i
take
it
and
see
each
other
every
day
i
know
your
ways
and
your
manners
then
i
fall
into
a
truculent
mood
and
would
like
to
destroy
somebody
have
you
noticed
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
lover
hanging
around
the
colonel
lares
and
penates
does
that
lieutenant
of
the
or
that
young
stillwater
parson
visit
the
house
much
not
that
i
am
pining
for
news
of
them
but
any
gossip
of
the
kind
would
be
in
order
i
wonder
ned
you
don
t
fall
in
love
with
miss
daw
i
am
ripe
to
do
it
myself
speaking
of
photographs
couldn
t
you
manage
to
slip
one
of
her
from
her
album
she
must
have
an
album
you
know
and
send
it
to
me
i
will
return
it
before
it
could
be
missed
that
s
a
good
fellow
did
the
mare
arrive
safe
and
sound
it
will
be
a
capital
animal
this
autumn
for
central
park
oh
my
leg
i
forgot
about
my
leg
it
s
better
vii
edward
delaney
to
john
flemmimg
august
you
are
correct
in
your
surmises
i
am
on
the
most
friendly
terms
with
our
neighbors
the
colonel
and
my
father
smoke
their
afternoon
cigar
together
in
our
or
on
the
piazza
opposite
and
i
pass
an
hour
or
two
of
the
day
or
the
evening
with
the
daughter
i
am
more
and
more
struck
by
the
beauty
modesty
and
intelligence
of
miss
daw
you
asked
me
why
i
do
not
fall
in
love
with
her
i
will
be
frank
jack
i
have
thought
of
that
she
is
young
rich
accomplished
uniting
in
herself
more
attractions
mental
and
personal
than
i
can
recall
in
any
girl
of
my
acquaintance
but
she
lacks
the
something
that
would
be
necessary
to
inspire
in
me
that
kind
of
interest
possessing
this
unknown
quality
a
woman
neither
beautiful
nor
wealthy
nor
very
young
could
bring
me
to
her
feet
but
not
miss
daw
if
we
were
shipwrecked
together
on
an
uninhabited
island
let
me
suggest
a
tropical
island
for
it
costs
no
more
to
be
picturesque
i
would
build
her
a
bamboo
hut
i
would
fetch
her
and
cocoanuts
i
would
fry
yams
for
her
i
would
lure
the
ingenuous
turtle
and
make
her
nourishing
soups
but
i
wouldn
t
make
love
to
her
not
under
eighteen
months
i
would
like
to
have
her
for
a
sister
that
i
might
shield
her
and
counsel
her
and
spend
half
my
income
on
old
threadlace
and
camel
shawls
we
are
off
the
island
now
if
such
were
not
my
feeling
there
would
still
be
an
obstacle
to
my
loving
miss
daw
a
greater
misfortune
could
scarcely
befall
me
than
to
love
her
flemming
i
am
about
to
make
a
revelation
that
will
astonish
you
i
may
be
all
wrong
in
my
premises
and
consequently
in
my
conclusions
but
you
shall
judge
that
night
when
i
returned
to
my
room
after
the
croquet
party
at
the
daw
s
and
was
thinking
over
the
trivial
events
of
the
evening
i
was
suddenly
impressed
by
the
air
of
eager
attention
with
which
miss
daw
had
followed
my
account
of
your
accident
i
think
i
mentioned
this
to
you
well
the
next
morning
as
i
went
to
mail
my
letter
i
overtook
miss
daw
on
the
road
to
rye
where
the
is
and
accompanied
her
thither
and
back
an
hour
s
walk
the
conversation
again
turned
to
you
and
again
i
remarked
that
inexplicable
look
of
interest
which
had
lighted
up
her
face
the
previous
evening
since
then
i
have
seen
miss
daw
perhaps
ten
times
perhaps
oftener
and
on
each
occasion
i
found
that
when
i
was
not
speaking
of
you
or
your
sister
or
some
person
or
place
associated
with
you
i
was
not
holding
her
attention
she
would
be
her
eyes
would
wander
away
from
me
to
the
sea
or
to
some
distant
object
in
the
landscape
her
fingers
would
play
with
the
leaves
of
a
book
in
a
way
that
convinced
me
she
was
not
listening
at
these
moments
if
i
abruptly
changed
the
theme
i
did
it
several
times
as
an
experiment
and
dropped
some
remark
about
my
friend
flemming
then
the
sombre
blue
eyes
would
come
back
to
me
instantly
now
is
not
this
the
oddest
thing
in
the
world
no
not
the
oddest
the
effect
which
you
tell
me
was
produced
on
you
by
my
casual
mention
of
an
unknown
girl
swinging
in
a
hammock
is
certainly
as
strange
you
can
conjecture
how
that
passage
in
your
letter
of
friday
startled
me
is
it
possible
than
that
two
people
who
have
never
met
and
who
are
hundreds
of
miles
apart
can
exert
a
magnetic
influence
on
each
other
i
have
read
of
such
psychological
phenomena
but
never
credited
them
i
leave
the
solution
of
the
problem
to
you
as
for
myself
all
other
things
being
favorable
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
fall
in
love
with
a
woman
who
listens
to
me
only
when
i
am
talking
of
my
friend
i
am
not
aware
that
any
one
is
paying
marked
attention
to
my
fair
neighbor
the
lieutenant
of
the
navy
he
is
stationed
at
rivermouth
sometimes
drops
in
of
an
evening
and
sometimes
the
rector
from
stillwater
the
lieutenant
the
oftener
he
was
there
last
night
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
had
an
eye
to
the
heiress
but
he
is
not
formidable
mistress
daw
carries
a
neat
little
spear
of
irony
and
the
honest
lieutenant
seems
to
have
a
particular
facility
for
impaling
himself
on
the
point
of
it
he
is
not
dangerous
i
should
say
though
i
have
known
a
woman
to
satirize
a
man
for
years
and
marry
him
after
all
decidedly
the
lowly
rector
is
not
dangerous
yet
again
who
has
not
seen
cloth
of
frieze
victorious
in
the
lists
where
cloth
of
gold
went
down
as
to
the
photograph
there
is
an
exquisite
of
marjorie
in
on
the
drawing
room
it
would
be
missed
at
once
if
taken
i
would
do
anything
reasonable
for
you
jack
but
i
ve
no
burning
desire
to
be
hauled
up
before
the
local
justice
of
the
peace
on
a
charge
of
petty
larceny
enclosed
is
a
spray
of
mignonette
which
i
advise
you
to
treat
tenderly
yes
we
talked
of
you
again
last
night
as
usual
it
is
becoming
a
little
dreary
for
me
viii
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
your
letter
in
reply
to
my
last
has
occupied
my
thoughts
all
the
morning
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
seriously
half
in
love
with
a
woman
whom
you
have
never
seen
with
a
shadow
a
chimera
for
what
else
can
miss
daw
to
be
you
i
do
not
understand
it
at
all
i
understand
neither
you
nor
her
you
are
a
couple
of
ethereal
beings
moving
in
finer
air
than
i
can
breathe
with
my
commonplace
lungs
such
delicacy
of
sentiment
is
something
that
i
admire
without
comprehending
i
am
bewildered
i
am
of
the
earth
earthy
and
i
find
myself
in
the
incongruous
position
of
having
to
do
with
mere
souls
with
natures
so
finely
tempered
that
i
run
some
risk
of
shattering
them
in
my
awkwardness
i
am
as
caliban
among
the
spirits
reflecting
on
your
letter
i
am
not
sure
that
it
is
wise
in
me
to
continue
this
correspondence
but
no
jack
i
do
wrong
to
doubt
the
good
sense
that
forms
the
basis
of
your
character
you
are
deeply
interested
in
miss
daw
you
feel
that
she
is
a
person
whom
you
may
perhaps
greatly
admire
when
you
know
her
at
the
same
time
you
bear
in
mind
that
the
chances
are
ten
to
five
that
when
you
do
come
to
know
her
she
will
fall
far
short
of
your
ideal
and
you
will
not
care
for
her
in
the
least
look
at
it
in
this
sensible
light
and
i
will
hold
back
nothing
from
you
yesterday
afternoon
my
father
and
myself
rode
over
to
rivermouth
with
the
daws
a
heavy
rain
in
the
morning
had
cooled
the
atmosphere
and
laid
the
dust
to
rivermouth
is
a
drive
of
eight
miles
along
a
winding
road
lined
all
the
way
with
wild
barberry
bushes
i
never
saw
anything
more
brilliant
than
these
bushes
the
green
of
the
foliage
and
the
faint
blush
of
the
berries
intensified
by
the
rain
the
colonel
drove
with
my
father
in
front
miss
daw
and
i
on
the
back
seat
i
resolved
that
for
the
first
five
miles
your
name
should
not
pass
my
lips
i
was
amused
by
the
artful
attempts
she
made
at
the
start
to
break
through
my
reticence
then
a
silence
fell
upon
her
and
then
she
became
suddenly
gay
that
keenness
which
i
enjoyed
so
much
when
it
was
exercised
on
the
lieutenant
was
not
so
satisfactory
directed
against
myself
miss
daw
has
great
sweetness
of
disposition
but
she
can
be
disagreeable
she
is
like
the
young
lady
in
the
rhyme
with
the
curl
on
her
forehead
when
she
is
good
she
is
very
very
good
and
when
she
is
bad
she
is
horrid
i
kept
to
my
resolution
however
but
on
the
return
home
i
relented
and
talked
of
your
mare
miss
daw
is
going
to
try
a
on
margot
some
morning
the
animal
is
a
trifle
too
light
for
my
weight
by
the
bye
i
nearly
forgot
to
say
that
miss
daw
sat
for
a
picture
yesterday
to
a
rivermouth
artist
if
the
negative
turns
out
well
i
am
to
have
a
copy
so
our
ends
will
be
accomplished
without
crime
i
wish
though
i
could
send
you
the
ivorytype
in
the
it
is
cleverly
colored
and
would
give
you
an
idea
of
her
hair
and
eyes
which
of
course
the
other
will
not
no
jack
the
spray
of
mignonette
did
not
come
from
me
a
man
of
doesn
t
enclose
flowers
in
his
letters
to
another
man
but
don
t
attach
too
much
significance
to
the
circumstance
she
gives
sprays
of
mignonette
to
the
rector
sprays
to
the
lieutenant
she
has
even
given
a
rose
from
her
bosom
to
your
slave
it
is
her
jocund
nature
to
scatter
flowers
like
spring
if
my
letters
sometimes
read
disjointedly
you
must
understand
that
i
never
finish
one
at
a
sitting
but
write
at
intervals
when
the
mood
is
on
me
the
mood
is
not
on
me
now
ix
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
i
have
just
returned
from
the
strangest
interview
with
marjorie
she
has
all
but
confessed
to
me
her
interest
in
you
but
with
what
modesty
and
dignity
her
words
elude
my
pen
as
i
attempt
to
put
them
on
paper
and
indeed
it
was
not
so
much
what
she
said
as
her
manner
and
that
i
can
not
reproduce
perhaps
it
was
of
a
piece
with
the
strangeness
of
this
whole
business
that
she
should
tacitly
acknowledge
to
a
third
party
the
love
she
feels
for
a
man
she
has
never
beheld
but
i
have
lost
through
your
aid
the
faculty
of
being
surprised
i
accept
things
as
people
do
in
dreams
now
that
i
am
again
in
my
room
it
all
appears
like
an
illusion
the
black
masses
of
rembrandtish
shadow
under
the
trees
the
fireflies
whirling
in
pyrrhic
dances
among
the
shrubbery
the
sea
over
there
marjorie
sitting
on
the
hammock
it
is
past
midnight
and
i
am
too
sleepy
to
write
more
thursday
morning
my
father
has
suddenly
taken
it
into
his
head
to
spend
a
few
days
at
the
shoals
in
the
meanwhile
you
will
not
hear
from
me
i
see
marjorie
walking
in
the
garden
with
the
colonel
i
wish
i
could
speak
to
her
alone
but
shall
probably
not
have
an
opportunity
before
we
leave
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
you
were
passing
into
your
second
childhood
were
you
your
intellect
was
so
reduced
that
my
epistolary
gifts
seemed
quite
considerable
to
you
did
they
i
rise
superior
to
the
sarcasm
in
your
favor
of
the
instant
when
i
notice
that
five
days
silence
on
my
part
is
sufficient
to
throw
you
into
the
depths
of
despondency
we
returned
only
this
morning
from
appledore
that
enchanted
island
at
four
dollars
per
day
i
find
on
my
desk
three
letters
from
you
evidently
there
is
no
lingering
doubt
in
your
mind
as
to
the
pleasure
i
derive
from
your
correspondence
these
letters
are
undated
but
in
what
i
take
to
be
the
latest
are
two
passages
that
require
my
consideration
you
will
pardon
my
candor
dear
flemming
but
the
conviction
forces
itself
upon
me
that
as
your
leg
grows
stronger
your
head
becomes
weaker
you
ask
my
advice
on
a
certain
point
i
will
give
it
in
my
opinion
you
could
do
nothing
more
unwise
that
to
address
a
note
to
miss
daw
thanking
her
for
the
flower
it
would
i
am
sure
offend
her
delicacy
beyond
pardon
she
knows
you
only
through
me
you
are
to
her
an
abstraction
a
figure
in
a
dream
a
dream
from
which
the
faintest
shock
would
awaken
her
of
course
if
you
enclose
a
note
to
me
and
insist
on
its
delivery
i
shall
deliver
it
but
i
advise
you
not
to
do
so
you
say
you
are
able
with
the
aid
of
a
cane
to
walk
about
your
chamber
and
that
you
purpose
to
come
to
the
pines
the
instant
dillon
thinks
you
strong
enough
to
stand
the
journey
again
i
advise
you
not
to
do
you
not
see
that
every
hour
you
remain
away
marjorie
s
glamour
deepens
and
your
influence
over
her
increases
you
will
ruin
everything
by
precipitancy
wait
until
you
are
entirely
recovered
in
any
case
do
not
come
without
giving
me
warning
i
fear
the
effect
of
your
abrupt
advent
here
under
the
circumstances
miss
daw
was
evidently
glad
to
see
us
back
again
and
gave
me
both
hands
in
the
frankest
way
she
stopped
at
the
door
a
moment
this
afternoon
in
the
carriage
she
had
been
over
to
rivermouth
for
her
pictures
unluckily
the
photographer
had
spilt
some
acid
on
the
plate
and
she
was
obliged
to
give
him
another
sitting
i
have
an
intuition
that
something
is
troubling
marjorie
she
had
an
abstracted
air
not
usual
with
her
however
it
may
be
only
my
fancy
i
end
this
leaving
several
things
unsaid
to
accompany
my
father
on
one
of
those
long
walks
which
are
now
his
chief
medicine
and
mine
xi
edward
delany
to
john
flemming
august
i
write
in
great
haste
to
tell
you
what
has
taken
place
here
since
my
letter
of
last
night
i
am
in
the
utmost
perplexity
only
one
thing
is
plain
you
must
not
dream
of
coming
to
the
pines
marjorie
has
told
her
father
everything
i
saw
her
for
a
few
minutes
an
hour
ago
in
the
garden
and
as
near
as
i
could
gather
from
her
confused
statement
the
facts
are
these
lieutenant
bradly
that
s
the
naval
officer
stationed
at
rivermouth
has
been
paying
court
to
miss
daw
for
some
time
past
but
not
so
much
to
her
liking
as
to
that
of
the
colonel
who
it
seems
is
an
old
fiend
of
the
young
gentleman
s
father
yesterday
i
knew
she
was
in
some
trouble
when
she
drove
up
to
our
gate
the
colonel
spoke
to
marjorie
of
bradly
urged
his
suit
i
infer
marjorie
expressed
her
dislike
for
the
lieutenant
with
characteristic
frankness
and
finally
confessed
to
her
father
well
i
really
do
not
know
what
she
confessed
it
must
have
been
the
vaguest
of
confessions
and
must
have
sufficiently
puzzled
the
colonel
at
any
rate
it
exasperated
him
i
suppose
i
am
implicated
in
the
matter
and
that
the
colonel
feels
bitterly
towards
me
i
do
not
see
why
i
have
carried
no
messages
between
you
and
miss
daw
i
have
behaved
with
the
greatest
discretion
i
can
find
no
flaw
anywhere
in
my
proceeding
i
do
not
see
that
anybody
has
done
anything
except
the
colonel
himself
it
is
probable
nevertheless
that
the
friendly
relations
between
the
two
houses
will
be
broken
off
a
plague
o
both
your
houses
say
you
i
will
keep
you
informed
as
well
as
i
can
of
what
occurs
over
the
way
we
shall
remain
here
until
the
second
week
in
september
stay
where
you
are
or
at
all
events
do
not
dream
of
joining
me
daw
is
sitting
on
the
piazza
looking
rather
wicked
i
have
not
seen
marjorie
since
i
parted
with
her
in
the
garden

edward

to
thomas
dillon
madison
square
new
york
august
my
dear
doctor
if
you
have
any
influence
over
flemming
i
beg
of
you
to
exert
it
to
prevent
his
coming
to
this
place
at
present
there
are
circumstances
which
i
will
explain
to
you
before
long
that
make
it
of
the
first
importance
that
he
should
not
come
into
this
neighborhood
his
appearance
here
i
speak
advisedly
would
be
disastrous
to
him
in
urging
him
to
remain
in
new
york
or
to
go
to
some
inland
resort
you
will
be
doing
him
and
me
a
real
service
of
course
you
will
not
mention
my
name
in
this
connection
you
know
me
well
enough
my
dear
doctor
to
be
assured
that
in
begging
your
secret
cooperation
i
have
reasons
that
will
meet
your
entire
approval
when
they
are
made
plain
to
you
we
shall
return
to
town
on
the
of
next
month
and
my
first
duty
will
be
to
present
myself
at
your
hospitable
door
and
satisfy
your
curiosity
if
i
have
excited
it
my
father
i
am
glad
to
state
has
so
greatly
improved
that
he
can
no
longer
be
regarded
as
an
invalid
with
great
esteem
i
am

xiii
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
august
your
letter
announcing
your
mad
determination
to
come
here
has
just
reached
me
i
beseech
you
to
reflect
a
moment
the
step
would
be
fatal
to
your
interests
and
hers
you
would
furnish
just
cause
for
irritation
to
and
though
he
loves
marjorie
devotedly
he
is
capable
of
going
to
any
lengths
if
opposed
you
would
not
like
i
am
convinced
to
be
the
means
of
causing
him
to
treat
her
with
severity
that
would
be
the
result
of
your
presence
at
the
pines
at
this
juncture
i
am
annoyed
to
be
obliged
to
point
out
these
things
to
you
we
are
on
very
delicate
ground
jack
the
situation
is
critical
and
the
slightest
mistake
in
a
move
would
cost
us
the
game
if
you
consider
it
worth
the
winning
be
patient
trust
a
little
to
my
sagacity
wait
and
see
what
happens
moreover
i
understand
from
dillon
that
you
are
in
no
condition
to
take
so
long
a
journey
he
thinks
the
air
of
the
coast
would
be
the
worst
thing
possible
for
you
that
you
ought
to
go
inland

only
complicated
matters
do
not
move
until
you
hear
from
me

to
edward

my
being
at
the

xv
the
arrival
on
the
second
day
of
september
as
the
down
express
due
at
left
the
station
at
hampton
a
young
man
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
a
servant
whom
he
addressed
as
watkins
stepped
from
the
platform
into
a
hack
and
requested
to
be
driven
to
the
on
arriving
at
the
gate
of
a
modest
a
few
miles
from
the
station
the
young
man
descended
with
difficulty
from
the
carriage
and
casting
a
hasty
glance
across
the
road
seemed
much
impressed
by
some
peculiarity
in
the
landscape
again
leaning
on
the
shoulder
of
the
person
watkins
he
walked
to
the
door
of
the
and
inquired
for
edward
delaney
he
was
informed
by
the
aged
man
who
answered
his
knock
that
edward
delaney
had
gone
to
boston
the
day
before
but
that
jonas
delaney
was
within
this
information
did
not
appear
satisfactory
to
the
stranger
who
inquired
if
edward
delaney
had
left
any
message
for
john
flemming
there
was
a
letter
for
flemming
if
he
were
that
person
after
a
brief
absence
the
aged
man
reappeared
with
a
letter
xvi
edward
delaney
to
john
flemming
september
i
am
at
what
i
have
done
when
i
began
this
correspondence
i
had
no
other
purpose
than
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
your
dillon
told
me
to
cheer
you
up
i
tried
to
i
thought
that
you
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
i
had
no
idea
until
within
a
few
days
that
you
were
taking
matters
au
grand
serieux
what
can
i
say
i
am
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
i
am
a
pariah
a
dog
of
an
outcast
i
tried
to
make
a
little
romance
to
interest
you
something
soothing
and
idyllic
and
by
jove
i
have
done
it
only
too
well
my
father
doesn
t
know
a
word
of
this
so
don
t
jar
the
old
gentleman
any
more
than
you
can
help

fly
from
the
wrath
to
come
when
you
