introduction
i
before
repeating
such
known
facts
of
congreve
life
as
seem
agreeable
to
the
present
occasion
and
before
attempting
with
the
courage
of
office
to
indicate
with
truth
what
manner
of
man
he
was
and
what
are
the
varying
qualities
of
his
four
comedies
it
seems
well
to
discuss
and
have
done
with
two
questions
obviously
pertinent
indeed
but
of
a
wider
scope
than
the
works
of
any
one
writer
the
first
is
a
stupid
question
which
may
be
happily
dismissed
with
brief
ceremony
grossness
of
language
the
phrase
is
an
assumption
is
a
matter
of
time
and
place
a
relative
matter
altogether
there
is
a
thing
and
a
generation
finds
a
name
for
it
the
delicacy
which
prompts
a
later
generation
to
reject
that
name
is
by
no
means
necessarily
a
result
of
stricter
habits
is
far
more
often
due
to
the
flatness
which
comes
of
untiring
repetition
and
to
the
greater
piquancy
of
litotes
i
am
told
that
there
are
or
were
people
in
america
who
reject
the
word
as
a
gross
word
but
they
must
have
found
a
synonym
so
there
is
not
a
word
in
congreve
for
which
there
is
not
some
equivalent
expression
in
contemporary
writing
he
says
this
or
that
your
modern
writers
say
one
man
may
even
think
the
monosyllables
in
better
taste
than
the
periphrases
another
may
sacrifice
to
his
intolerance
thereof
such
enjoyment
as
he
was
capable
of
taking
from
the
greatest
triumphs
of
diction
or
observation
he
is
free
to
choose
it
may
be
granted
that
to
one
unfamiliar
with
the
english
of
two
centuries
since
the
grossness
of
congreve
language
may
seem
excessive
like
splashes
of
colour
occurring
too
frequently
in
the
arrangement
of
a
wall
but
that
is
merely
a
result
of
novelty
given
time
and
habit
a
more
artistic
perspective
will
be
achieved
the
second
question
is
more
complex
since
jeremy
collier
let
off
his
view
of
the
immorality
and
profaneness
of
the
english
there
has
never
lacked
a
critic
to
chastise
or
to
deplore
the
more
effective
and
irritating
course
not
simply
the
coarseness
but
the
immorality
of
our
old
comedies
their
attitude
towards
and
their
peculiar
interests
in
life
without
affirming
that
we
are
now
come
to
the
golden
age
of
criticism
one
may
rejoice
that
modern
methods
have
taught
quite
humble
critics
to
discriminate
between
issues
and
to
deal
with
such
a
matter
as
this
with
some
mental
detachment
the
great
primal
fallacy
comes
from
a
habit
of
expecting
everything
in
everything
just
as
in
a
picture
it
is
not
enough
for
some
people
that
it
is
well
drawn
and
well
painted
but
they
demand
an
interesting
story
a
fine
sentiment
a
great
thought
so
since
our
national
glory
is
understood
to
be
the
happy
home
the
happy
home
must
be
triumphant
everywhere
even
in
satiric
comedy
the
best
expression
of
this
fallacy
is
in
thackeray
concluding
a
most
eloquent
and
a
somewhat
patronising
examination
of
congreve
he
exclaims
a
weary
feast
that
banquet
of
wit
where
no
love
is
the
answer
is
plain
comedy
of
manners
is
comedy
of
manners
and
satire
is
satire
introduce
an
appeal
one
supposes
to
sympathy
with
strictly
legitimate
and
common
affection
and
a
glorification
of
the
happy
home
and
the
rules
of
your
art
compel
you
to
satirise
affection
and
to
make
the
happy
home
ridiculous
a
truly
deplorable
work
which
the
incriminated
dramatists
were
discreet
enough
for
the
most
part
to
avoid
the
remark
brings
us
to
the
first
of
the
which
cause
the
complexity
of
the
subject
the
dramatists
whose
withers
the
and
disastrous
collier
wrung
seem
to
have
thought
their
best
answer
was
to
pose
as
people
with
a
mission
certainly
congreve
so
posed
to
reform
the
world
with
an
exhibition
of
its
follies
an
amusing
answer
no
doubt
of
which
the
absurdity
is
obvious
it
does
however
contain
a
the
idea
of
way
of
the
reforming
adulterers
observe
the
quotation
from
horace
on
the
is
a
little
delicious
yet
the
exhibition
in
a
ludicrous
light
of
the
thing
satirised
is
surely
an
end
of
satiric
comedy
the
right
of
the
matter
is
indicated
in
a
sentence
which
occurs
in
the
dedication
of
far
more
wisely
than
in
congreve
answer
to
collier
should
be
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
make
my
compliment
to
those
ladies
who
are
offended
but
they
can
no
more
expect
it
in
a
comedy
than
to
be
tickled
by
a
surgeon
when
he
letting
blood
something
more
than
a
is
in
charles
lamb
theory
that
the
old
comedy
no
reference
whatever
to
the
world
that
is
that
it
is
utopia
of
gallantry
merely
literally
historically
the
theory
is
a
fantasy
what
the
restoration
dramatists
did
not
borrow
from
france
was
inspired
directly
by
the
court
of
charles
the
second
and
nobody
conversant
with
the
memoirs
of
that
court
can
have
any
difficulty
in
matching
the
fiction
with
reality
i
imagine
that
congreve
in
part
accepted
a
tradition
of
the
stage
but
i
am
also
perfectly
well
assured
that
he
depicted
what
he
saw
how
far
the
virtues
we
should
associate
with
the
charles
the
second
spirit
may
atone
for
its
vices
is
a
question
which
would
take
us
far
into
moral
philosophy
it
is
enough
to
remark
that
those
vices
are
the
exclusive
possession
of
no
period
so
long
as
society
is
constituted
in
anything
like
its
present
order
there
must
be
a
section
of
it
for
which
those
vices
are
the
main
interest
in
life
but
charles
lamb
gay
and
engaging
defiance
of
the
of
his
day
has
this
value
it
is
most
certainly
just
to
say
that
in
appreciating
satiric
comedy
coxcombical
moral
sense
must
be
a
little
transitory
ease
excluded
for
one
may
apprehend
the
whole
truth
to
be
somewhat
thus
satiric
comedy
or
comedy
of
manners
is
the
art
of
making
ludicrous
in
dramatic
form
some
phase
of
life
the
writers
of
our
old
comedy
thought
that
certain
vices
gambling
adultery
and
the
like
formed
a
phase
of
life
which
for
divers
reasons
essential
and
accidental
lent
itself
best
to
their
purpose
they
may
or
may
not
have
thought
they
were
doing
society
a
service
their
real
justification
is
that
as
artists
they
had
to
take
for
their
art
that
material
they
could
use
best
they
used
it
according
to
their
lights
wycherley
with
a
coarse
and
heavy
hand
so
that
it
became
nauseous
etherege
with
a
light
touch
and
a
gay
perception
congreve
with
an
instinct
of
with
a
sure
and
extensive
observation
and
with
an
incomparable
style
but
all
were
justified
in
choosing
for
their
material
just
what
they
chose
they
sinned
artistically
now
here
now
there
but
to
complain
of
this
old
comedy
as
a
whole
that
vice
in
it
is
crammed
too
closely
is
to
forget
that
a
play
is
a
picture
not
a
photograph
of
life
is
life
arranged
and
coloured
and
that
comedy
of
manners
is
composed
of
foibles
or
vices
condensed
and
relieved
by
one
another
in
so
far
as
they
overdid
this
work
the
comic
writers
were
artistically
at
fault
and
jeremy
collier
was
a
good
critic
but
when
he
and
his
successors
go
beyond
the
artistic
objection
one
takes
leave
to
say
they
misapprehend
the
thing
criticised
to
complain
that
and
common
morality
have
no
place
in
satiric
comedy
is
either
to
contemplate
ridicule
of
them
or
to
ask
comedy
to
be
other
than
satiric
we
know
what
happened
when
the
dramatists
gave
way
there
followed
hazlitt
says
whining
comedies
in
the
next
age
which
are
enough
to
set
one
to
sleep
and
where
the
author
tries
in
vain
to
be
merry
and
wise
in
the
same
breath
these
in
place
of
court
the
gala
day
of
wit
and
pleasure
of
gallantry
and
charles
the
second
and
all
because
people
would
not
keep
their
functions
distinct
and
remember
that
at
a
comedy
they
were
in
a
court
of
art
and
not
in
a
court
of
law
the
old
comedy
is
dead
and
its
spirit
gone
from
the
stage
i
have
but
endeavoured
to
show
that
no
harm
need
come
to
our
phylacteries
if
a
flame
start
from
its
ashes
in
the
printed
book
ii
william
congreve
was
born
at
bardsey
near
leeds
and
was
baptized
on
february
the
congreves
were
a
staffordshire
family
of
an
antiquity
of
four
hundred
years
at
the
date
of
the
poet
birth
richard
his
grandfather
was
a
redoubtable
cavalier
and
william
his
father
an
officer
in
the
army
the
latter
was
given
a
command
at
youghal
while
his
son
was
still
an
infant
and
becoming
shortly
afterwards
agent
to
lord
cork
removed
to
lismore
so
it
chanced
that
the
poet
had
his
schooling
at
kilkenny
with
swift
and
proceeded
to
trinity
college
dublin
in
rejoining
swift
and
like
his
friend
becoming
a
pupil
of
george
ashe
the
mathematician
in
he
left
dublin
remained
with
his
people
in
staffordshire
for
some
two
years
entered
himself
at
the
temple
and
came
upon
the
town
with
old
in
january
was
produced
in
november
in
a
storm
in
the
theatre
led
to
a
secession
of
betterton
and
other
renowned
players
from
drury
lane
with
the
result
that
a
new
playhouse
was
opened
in
lincoln
inn
fields
on
april
with
for
in
the
same
year
congreve
was
appointed
for
licensing
hackney
coaches
mourning
was
produced
in
and
was
followed
oddly
enough
by
the
controversy
or
rather
with
jeremy
collier
in
march
came
way
of
the
the
poet
was
made
commissioner
of
in
and
in
with
his
jamaica
secretaryship
and
his
places
in
the
customs
and
the
delightful
he
had
an
income
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
he
died
at
his
house
in
surrey
street
strand
on
january
one
or
two
comments
on
these
dates
are
obvious
they
dissipate
the
thackerayan
fable
that
on
the
production
of
old
the
fortunate
young
author
received
a
shower
of
sinecures
for
writing
a
comedy
crazy
congreve
scarce
could
spare
a
shilling
to
discharge
a
chair
writes
swift
and
indicates
that
congreve
was
gouty
before
he
was
rich
but
then
the
gout
was
a
very
early
factor
in
his
life
and
one
may
call
the
line
an
exaggeration
another
couplet
congreve
spent
in
writing
plays
and
one
poor
office
half
his
days
probably
expresses
the
truth
with
his
plays
and
his
hackney
coaches
he
doubtless
got
through
his
twenties
and
thirties
with
no
very
hardly
grinding
poverty
and
at
forty
or
so
was
comfortably
secure
but
another
fact
which
the
dates
bring
out
very
sharply
has
a
different
interest
at
an
age
when
swift
was
beginning
to
try
his
powers
congreve
work
was
done
a
few
odes
a
few
letters
he
was
still
to
write
but
no
more
comedies
was
it
or
because
the
town
had
all
but
damned
his
greatest
play
or
because
he
cared
more
for
life
than
for
art
iii
the
question
brings
one
to
an
attempted
appreciation
of
the
man
gosse
for
whose
i
would
express
my
gratitude
confesses
that
is
not
very
easy
to
construct
a
definite
portrait
of
congreve
but
that
it
baffled
that
very
new
journalist
manley
in
his
own
day
and
gosse
with
his
information
in
ours
to
give
points
to
congreve
character
proves
in
itself
an
essential
characteristic
which
need
be
negatively
stated
only
by
choice
that
no
amusing
eccentricities
are
recorded
no
ludicrous
adventures
no
persistent
quarrels
implies
taken
with
other
facts
we
know
that
he
was
a
man
of
the
world
with
the
habit
of
society
that
in
itself
is
a
definite
personal
quality
one
supposes
him
an
man
not
inclined
to
clown
for
the
amusement
of
his
world
he
was
loved
by
his
friends
being
tolerant
and
understanding
the
art
of
social
life
he
was
successful
and
must
therefore
have
had
enemies
but
he
was
careless
to
improve
hostilities
for
the
temperament
which
is
so
plain
in
the
best
of
his
writings
must
have
been
present
in
his
life
an
unobtrusive
because
a
never
directly
implied
superiority
and
an
ironical
humour
the
picture
of
swaggering
snobbishness
which
thackeray
was
inspired
to
make
of
him
is
proved
bad
by
all
that
we
know
a
swaggerer
could
not
have
made
a
fast
friend
of
dryden
grown
mellow
indeed
but
by
no
means
beggared
of
his
fire
on
his
first
coming
to
town
nor
kept
the
intimacy
of
swift
nor
avoided
the
of
dennis
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
suppose
that
congreve
famous
remark
to
voltaire
that
he
wished
to
be
visited
as
a
plain
gentleman
was
the
remark
if
it
was
made
of
a
snob
it
was
clearly
a
legitimate
deprecation
spoken
by
a
man
who
had
written
nothing
notable
for
years
which
voltaire
misunderstood
in
a
moment
of
stupidity
or
in
one
of
forgetfulness
misrepresented
his
superiority
and
his
irony
came
from
a
just
sense
of
the
perspective
of
things
and
not
preventing
affection
for
his
friends
left
him
indifferent
to
his
foes
probably
also
a
course
of
dissipation
at
which
swift
hints
in
his
youth
acting
on
a
temperament
not
particularly
ardent
had
left
him
with
such
passions
for
war
and
love
as
were
well
under
control
the
two
women
with
whom
his
name
is
connected
were
bracegirdle
and
the
duchess
of
marlborough
but
nobody
knew
though
the
latter
mother
hinted
the
worst
how
far
the
intimacy
went
that
is
to
say
no
patent
scandal
was
necessary
to
the
connexion
if
in
either
case
congreve
was
a
lover
and
once
more
congreve
was
a
gentleman
but
why
did
he
become
sterile
at
thirty
where
if
not
in
dealing
with
motives
and
causes
may
one
be
here
there
are
many
of
which
the
first
to
be
given
is
mere
conjecture
but
conjecture
i
fancy
not
inconsistent
with
such
facts
as
are
known
when
congreve
produced
his
first
comedy
he
was
but
fresh
from
college
and
the
country
ignorant
as
we
are
told
of
the
world
he
discovered
very
soon
that
he
had
an
aptitude
for
social
life
that
no
doubt
living
humours
and
follies
were
as
entertaining
as
printed
ones
that
for
a
popular
and
witty
man
the
world
was
pleasant
but
no
man
may
be
socially
finished
all
at
once
in
the
course
of
the
seven
years
between
old
and
way
of
the
congreve
must
have
found
his
wit
becoming
readier
his
tact
surer
his
appreciation
of
natural
comedy
finer
and
as
personal
keenness
decreased
more
equable
his
popularity
greater
and
in
fine
the
world
more
pleasant
and
the
attractions
of
the
study
waning
and
waning
in
comparison
he
was
a
finished
artist
he
was
born
one
might
almost
say
with
a
style
but
his
inclination
was
to
put
his
art
into
life
rather
than
into
print
even
in
our
days
thank
god
for
all
his
mercies
everybody
is
not
writing
a
book
there
are
people
whose
talk
has
inimitable
touches
and
whose
lives
are
art
but
who
never
sit
down
to
a
quire
of
foolscap
i
believe
that
congreve
naturally
was
one
of
these
that
his
literary
ambition
was
a
result
of
accidental
necessity
and
that
had
he
lived
as
a
boy
in
the
society
he
was
of
as
a
very
young
man
for
all
its
literary
ornaments
we
should
have
had
of
him
only
odes
and
songs
his
generation
was
idler
and
took
itself
less
seriously
than
ours
the
primal
curse
was
not
imposed
on
everybody
as
a
duty
in
seven
years
of
growing
appreciation
congreve
came
to
think
the
little
graces
and
humours
the
better
part
that
i
believe
to
have
been
the
first
cause
of
his
early
sterility
but
others
helped
to
determine
the
effect
a
certain
indolence
is
of
course
implied
in
what
has
been
said
there
was
the
gout
and
there
were
his
unfortunate
obesity
and
his
failing
sight
there
was
henrietta
duchess
of
marlborough
an
absorbing
dame
there
were
the
success
of
for
and
the
failure
of
way
of
the
for
all
that
may
be
said
of
the
indifference
of
the
true
artist
to
the
verdict
of
the
beast
and
congreve
contempt
was
as
fine
as
any
it
is
not
amusing
when
your
play
or
your
book
falls
flat
and
congreve
must
have
known
that
he
might
write
another
and
possibly
a
better
of
the
but
no
more
for
not
to
anticipate
a
later
division
of
the
subject
it
may
be
said
here
that
a
man
of
thirty
of
a
fine
intellect
and
a
fine
taste
of
a
languid
habit
withal
and
with
an
invalided
constitution
while
he
might
repeat
the
triumphs
of
diction
and
intellect
of
way
of
the
was
most
unlikely
to
return
to
the
broader
humours
and
the
more
popular
gaiety
of
the
other
play
congreve
like
rochester
before
him
despised
the
judgment
of
the
town
in
these
matters
but
by
the
town
he
would
have
to
be
judged
he
was
a
witty
handsome
man
of
the
world
of
imperturbable
temper
and
infinite
tact
who
could
make
and
keep
the
friendship
of
very
various
men
and
be
intimate
with
a
woman
without
quarrelling
with
her
lovers
he
had
a
taste
for
pictures
and
a
love
for
music
he
must
have
hated
violence
and
uproar
and
liked
the
finer
shades
of
life
he
wore
the
mode
of
his
day
and
was
free
from
the
superficial
protests
of
the
minded
possibly
not
a
very
portrait
possibly
a
very
negative
characterisation
possibly
also
a
tolerably
sure
foundation
for
a
structure
of
sympathetic
imagination
iv
passing
from
necessarily
vague
and
not
obviously
pertinent
remarks
to
criticism
which
may
fairly
be
less
diffident
we
leave
congreve
life
and
come
to
his
work
to
his
playhouse
taper
as
thackeray
called
it
it
is
only
after
the
man
has
appeared
that
we
recognise
that
he
came
at
the
hour
but
the
nature
of
the
hour
is
in
this
case
not
difficult
to
be
discerned
the
habit
of
playgoing
was
the
turmoil
of
the
revolution
was
over
de
jure
was
at
a
comfortable
distance
and
de
facto
wife
was
a
patroness
of
the
arts
but
playgoers
had
but
to
be
shown
something
better
than
that
they
had
to
discover
that
the
convention
of
the
restoration
needed
new
blood
a
justification
of
its
choice
of
material
has
been
attempted
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
affirming
that
the
tendency
to
use
it
with
a
mere
monotony
of
ribaldry
was
emphatic
of
this
tendency
the
most
notable
and
useful
illustration
is
wycherley
because
in
point
of
wit
and
dramatic
skill
he
dwarfed
his
colleagues
as
swinburne
has
said
the
art
of
congreve
is
different
in
kind
not
merely
in
degree
from
the
cruder
and
more
boisterous
product
of
the
dramatist
happily
however
for
his
success
the
difference
was
not
instantly
clear
his
first
play
links
him
with
wycherley
not
with
that
rare
and
faint
embryo
of
the
later
congreve
george
etherege
was
always
a
gentleman
george
as
the
valet
says
in
happily
for
his
popularity
congreve
first
followed
the
more
popular
man
it
is
not
indeed
until
he
wrote
his
last
play
that
he
was
a
whole
etherege
idealised
albeit
a
greater
than
etherege
in
the
meantime
the
peculiar
effect
which
etherege
achieved
in
fopling
at
whom
and
with
whom
you
laugh
at
once
was
not
sublimated
the
fineness
left
the
faintness
become
firmness
until
congreve
created
witwoud
the
inimitable
in
way
of
the
at
the
very
first
congreve
had
good
fortune
in
his
players
it
was
a
brave
time
for
them
true
their
salaries
were
not
wonderfully
large
colley
cibber
complains
of
the
days
before
the
revolt
in
what
unequal
salaries
the
hired
actors
were
held
by
the
absolute
authority
of
their
frugal
masters
the
patentees
but
the
example
was
not
faded
of
those
gay
days
when
they
were
the
pets
of
the
most
artistic
court
that
england
has
known
when
great
ladies
carried
kynaston
in
his
dress
to
hyde
park
after
the
play
and
the
king
was
the
most
persistent
and
the
most
interested
playgoer
in
his
realm
they
were
not
thus
petted
for
irrelevant
reasons
for
their
respectability
their
piety
or
their
domestic
virtues
and
their
recognition
as
artists
by
an
artistic
society
did
not
spoil
their
art
when
congreve
started
on
his
course
of
writing
queen
mary
kept
up
in
a
measure
the
amiable
custom
of
her
uncle
he
was
very
fortunate
in
his
casts
there
was
betterton
first
of
all
the
versatile
the
restrained
and
witness
everybody
the
incomparable
there
was
underhill
correct
and
natural
comedian
one
must
quote
cibber
pretty
often
in
this
connexion
not
well
suited
one
must
suppose
to
play
setter
to
betterton
heartwell
in
old
but
by
reason
of
his
admirable
assumption
of
stupidity
to
make
an
excellent
sir
sampson
in
for
there
were
powel
williams
verbruggen
bowen
and
dogget
fondlewife
in
the
first
play
afterwards
ben
legend
a
part
which
made
his
fame
and
turned
his
head
all
notable
comedians
kynaston
graceful
in
old
age
as
he
had
been
beautiful
in
youth
was
not
in
old
but
created
lord
touchwood
in
mountfort
had
been
murdered
by
my
lord
mohun
and
leigh
had
followed
him
to
the
grave
but
their
names
lived
in
their
wives
mountfort
mistress
of
more
variety
of
humour
than
i
ever
knew
in
any
one
woman
actress
nothing
though
ever
so
barren
if
within
the
bounds
of
nature
could
be
flat
in
her
hands
indeed
was
so
fond
of
humour
in
what
low
part
soever
to
be
found
that
she
would
make
no
scruple
of
defacing
her
fair
form
to
come
heartily
into
it
assuredly
a
rare
actress
about
leigh
cibber
is
less
enthusiastic
but
grants
her
good
deal
of
humour
her
old
women
were
famous
barry
was
a
stately
dignified
actress
best
no
doubt
in
tragedy
lastly
there
was
bracegirdle
the
innocent
whom
authors
courted
through
their
plays
and
who
had
all
the
men
in
the
house
for
longing
lovers
who
shall
say
how
far
youth
and
lively
aspect
influenced
the
criticisms
that
have
come
down
to
us
she
played
millamant
to
congreve
satisfaction
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
how
it
was
that
dryden
thought
old
the
best
first
play
he
had
seen
and
the
town
applauded
to
the
echo
but
it
is
a
little
hard
to
understand
why
later
critics
with
the
three
other
comedies
before
them
have
not
more
expressly
marked
the
difference
between
the
first
and
those
there
is
no
new
tune
in
old
it
is
an
old
tune
more
finely
played
and
for
that
very
reason
it
met
with
immediate
acceptance
it
is
not
likely
that
dryden
a
great
poet
and
a
great
and
generous
critic
it
may
be
but
an
old
man
would
have
bestowed
such
unhesitating
approval
on
a
play
which
ignored
the
conventions
in
which
he
had
lived
as
it
was
he
saw
those
conventions
reverently
followed
yet
served
by
a
master
wit
the
fact
that
congreve
allowed
dryden
and
others
to
his
play
by
giving
it
an
air
of
the
stage
and
the
town
which
it
lacked
need
not
of
course
spoil
it
for
us
the
stamp
of
congreve
is
clearly
marked
on
the
dialogue
though
not
on
every
page
you
may
see
its
essentials
in
two
passages
taken
absolutely
at
random
come
says
bellmour
in
the
very
first
scene
business

idlers
and
wisdom
to
fools

have

my
faculty

pleasure

occupation
and
let

shake

isaac
why
art
thee
jealous
why
art
thee
distrustful
of
the
wife
of
thy
bosom
because
she
is
young
and
vigorous
and
i
am
old
and
impotent
then
why
didst
thee
marry
isaac
because
she
was
beautiful
and
tempting
and
because
i
was
obstinate
and
doating
in
the
one
passage
is
the
gay
and
skilfully
light
paradox
in
the
other
the
clean
rhythmical
and
balanced
yet
dramatic
and
appropriate
english
that
are
elements
of
congreve
style
it
is
in
the
conventions
of
its
characterisation
that
old
belongs
not
to
true
congrevean
comedy
but
to
that
of
the
models
from
which
he
was
to
break
away
the
characterisation
of
way
of
the
is
light
and
true
that
of
old
is
heavy
and
yet
vague
vainlove
indeed
the
in

canting
at
the
gate
is
individual
and
congrevean
but
heartwell
the
blustering
fool

the
impersonal
rake

and
bluffe
the
farcical
sticks
fondlewife
the
immemorial
city
husband
and
the
troop
of
undistinguished
women
what
can
be
said
of
them
but
that
they
are
glaring
stage
properties
speaking
better
english
than
the
comic
stage
had
before
attracted
germs
possibly
of
better
things
to
come
that
is
all
so
far
as
characterisation
goes
the
fondlewife
episode
in
particular
which
doubtless
was
mightily
popular
what
is
there
more
in
it
than
the
mutton
fisted
wit
and
brutality
of
wycherley
with
some
of
congreve
english
such
scenes
as
these
it
may
be
hazarded
so
contemptible
in
the
light
of
congreve
better
work
are
ineffective
now
because
they
fall
between
two
stools
between
the
comedy
or
tragedy
of
a
crude
physical
fact
naked
and
impossible
as
in
rochester
and
the
comedy
or
tragedy
of
intrigue
the
latter
was
yet
to
come
when
this
play
was
produced
and
meantime
such
episodes
went
very
well
and
their
popularity
is
intelligible
for
the
rest
old
though
to
us
in
these
days
its
plot
appear
a
somewhat
uninspiring
piece
of
fairyland
was
a
good
acting
play
fitted
with
great
skill
to
its
actual
players
the
part
of
fondlewife
created
by
dogget
was
on
a
revival
played
to
his
own
immense
satisfaction
by
colley
cibber
in
araminta
bracegirdle
began
in
a
faint
outline
as
it
were
the
series
of
lively
sympathetic
intelligent
heroines
which
congreve
wrote
for
her
lord
falkland
prologue
is
as
funny
as
it
is
indecently
suggestive
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
the
one
actually
spoken
gave
an
opportunity
of
the
merriest
archness
to
bracegirdle
and
was
calculated
to
put
the
audience
in
the
best
of
good
humours
the
faults
of
are
obvious
on
a
first
reading
and
were
very
justly
condemned
on
a
first
acting
the
intrigue
is
wearisome
its
involutions
are
ineffectively
puzzling
maskwell
villainy
and
mellefont
folly
are
both
unconvincing
the
tragedy
of
lady
touchwood
less
tragic
than
that
of
lady
wishfort
in
way
of
the
is
more
obviously
than
that
out
of
the
picture
the
play
is
in
fact
not
pure
comedy
of
manners
it
is
that
tragedy
an
element
less
offensive
than
the
sentimentality
which
spoils
school
for
but
yet
a
notable
fault
for
while
you
can
resolve
the
tragedy
of
lady
wishfort
into
wicked
and
very
grim
comedy
you
can
do
nothing
with
the
tragedy
of
lady
touchwood
but
try
to
ignore
it
in
his
epistle
dedicatory
to
charles
montague
congreve
admits
that
his
play
has
faults
but
does
not
take
in
hand
those
adduced
above
with
the
exception
of
the
objections
to
maskwell
and
mellefont
have
mistaken
cunning
in
one
character
for
folly
in
another
an
ineffectual
answer
because
the
extremity
of
cunning
is
equally
destructive
of
dramatic
balance
he
defends
his
use
of
soliloquy
very
warmly
of
which
it
may
be
said
that
so
long
as
his
rule
that
no
character
may
overhear
the
soliloquiser
is
observed
it
is
a
tolerable
convention
but
a
confession
of
weakness
in
construction
he
declares
he
rather
disoblige
all
the
critics
in
the
world
than
one
of
the
fair
sex
and
having
made
his
bow
he
turns
upon
the
ladies
and
rends
them
an
author
campaigning
against
his
critics
is
always
a
pleasant
spectacle
but
congreve
defence
of
is
rather
amusing
than
convincing
it
needed
no
defence
for
with
all
its
faults
such
as
they
are
upon
it
there
are
in
it
scenes
and
characters
which
only
congreve
could
have
made
brisk
is
a
worthy
forerunner
of
witwoud
sir
paul
plyant
a
delicious
old
credulous
fool
while
the
tyrannical
and
vain
lady
plyant
is
so
drawn
that
you
almost
love
her
but
the
triumph
is
lady
froth
great
coquet
pretender
to
poetry
wit
and
learning
and
one
would
almost
as
lief
have
seen
mountfort
in
the
part
as
the
millamant
her
serious
folly
and
foolish
wisdom
her
poem
and
malice
and
compliments
and
babbling
vivacity
set
off
it
is
fair
to
remember
by
a
pretty
face
are
atonement
for
a
dozen
maskwells
she
is
a
female
witwoud
her
author
first
success
in
a
sort
of
character
he
draws
to
perfection
the
scene
between
mellefont
and
lady
plyant
where
she
insists
on
believing
that
the
gallant
under
cover
of
a
marriage
with
her
stepdaughter
purposes
to
lead
her
astray
and
where
she
goes
through
a
delightful
farce
of
answering
her
scruples
before
the
bewildered
man
the
scene
that
for
some
reason
led
macaulay
mind
to
the
incest
in
the
is
perhaps
the
best
comedy
of
situation
in
the
piece
but
the
scene
of
defamation
between
the
froths
and
brisk
is
notable
as
with
the
cabal
idea
in
way
of
the
the
inspiration
of
the
scandal
scenes
in
sheridan
play
when
we
remember
that
less
than
two
years
were
gone
since
the
production
of
old
the
improvement
in
congreve
is
remarkable
almost
his
only
concession
to
the
groundlings
is
the
episode
of
lady
froth
and
brisk
a
mistake
because
it
spoils
her
inconsequent
folly
but
a
small
matter
in
his
second
play
congreve
was
himself
the
wittiest
and
most
polished
writer
of
comedy
in
english
in
the
face
of
this
fact
public
conducted
itself
characteristically
it
more
or
less
damned
until
the
queen
approved
when
it
applauded
lustily
that
occasion
gave
colley
cibber
his
first
chance
as
kynaston
substitute
in
lord
touchwood
when
one
remembers
dryden
long
struggling
cudgelling
and
cudgelled
life
it
is
impossible
to
read
without
emotion
his
tribute
to
a
very
young
and
successful
author
in
the
verses
prefixed
to
this
play
firm
doric
pillars
found
your
solid
base
the
fair
corinthian
crowns
the
higher
space
thus
all
below
is
strength
and
all
above
is
grace
we
can
not
envy
you
because
we
love
time
place
and
action
may
with
pains
be
wrought
but
genius
must
be
born
and
never
can
be
taught
this
is
your
portion
this
your
native
store
that
but
once
was
prodigal
before
to
shakespeare
gave
as
much
she
could
not
give
him
more
the
tribute
is
indubitably
sincere
in
point
of
congreve
wit
and
diction
it
is
as
indubitably
true
for
was
the
most
popular
of
congreve
comedies
it
held
the
stage
so
long
that
hazlitt
could
say
still
acts
and
is
still
acted
well
being
wise
after
the
event
one
may
give
some
obvious
reasons
it
is
more
human
than
any
other
of
his
plays
and
at
the
same
time
more
farcical
by
human
it
is
not
meant
that
the
characters
are
truer
to
life
than
those
in
way
of
the
but
that
they
are
truer
to
average
life
and
therefore
more
easily
recognisable
by
the
average
spectator
tattle
for
instance
is
so
gross
a
fool
that
any
fool
in
the
pit
could
see
his
folly
witwoud
might
deceive
all
but
the
elect
no
familiarity
direct
or
indirect
with
a

to

the

it
is
full
of
laughter
no

it

success
it
is
intellectually
on
an
altogether
different
plane
from

a
slightly
lower
one

in
its

it

irresistibly
funny
and
by
reason
of
its
diction
it
is
never
for
a
moment
other
than
distinguished

imagine
the
bodkin

will
always
take
the

in

every

broad

it

but
it
is
not
especially
congrevean
tattle
to
miss
prue
and
his
boasting
of
his
duchesses
are
in
the
same
broad
vein
valentine
mad
scene
is
more
remarkable
in
that
congreve
gives
rein
to
his
fancy
and
that
his
diction
is
at
its
very
best
i
have
a
secret

i

i
loved
a

and
loved
her
so
long
that
i
found
out
a
strange
thing
i
found
out
what
a

was
good
for
imagine
betterton
the
greatest
actor
of
his
time
delivering
that
last
speech
with
its
incomparable
rhythm
i
like
to
think
that
he
gave
the
spectators
an
idea
that
valentine
for
angelica
was
nothing
but
a
bold
device
a
calculated
effect
otherwise
the
sacrifice
is
an
excrescence
in
this
comedy
which
popular
and
broad
though
it
be
is
cynical
in
congreve
manner
throughout
one
is
consoled
however
by
the
pleasant
fate
of
the
ingenious
tattle
and
the
intriguing
mrs
frail
who
are
left
tied
for
life
against
their
will
the
trick
by
the
way
of
a
tricked
marriage
is
constant
in
congreve
and
reveals
his
poverty
of
construction
he
can
devise
you
comic
situations
unflaggingly
but
when
he
approaches
the
end
of
a
play
his
ex
is
invariably
this
flattest
and
most
battered
old
deity
in
fairyland
the
dedication
to
lord
dorset
contains
nothing
of
interest
beyond
the
confession
that
the
play
is
too
long
and
the
information
that
part
of
it
was
omitted
in
the
playing
a
line
in
the
prologue

explained
by
colley
cibber
to
refer
to

who
having
cast
her
lot
with

and
migrated
to
lincoln

threw
up
her
part
on
a
question
of
cash
and
to

an
actor
who
his
bottle
better
than
his
business
who
deserted
at
the
same
time
it
serves
to
show
the
interest
the
town
took
in
the
players
that
the
fact
was
referred
to
on
the
stage
the
part

taken
by

very
poor
part

as

been
noted
bracegirdle
angelica
was
doubtless
ravishing
a
young
woman
as
our
ancestors
phrased
it
but
quite
relieved
from
insipidity
it
would
need
a
greater
presumption
than
the
writer
is
gifted
withal
to
add
his
contribution
to
the
praises
critics
have
lavished
on
way
of
the
it
is
better
to
quote
swinburne
congreve
replied
to
collier
with
the
crowning
work
of
his
genius
the
unequalled
and
unapproached
masterpiece
of
english
comedy
the
one
play
in
our
language
which
may
fairly
claim
a
place
beside
or
but
just
beneath
the
mightiest
work
of
moliere
is
way
of
the
but
he
continues
the
stage
which
had
recently
acclaimed
with
uncritical
applause
the
author
more
questionable
appearance
in
the
field
of
tragedy
mourning
final
and
flawless
evidence
of
his
incomparable
powers
met
with
a
rejection
then
and
ever
since
inexplicable
on
any
ground
of
conjecture
there
the
critics
are
not
unanimous
gosse
for
instance
has
his
explanation
that
the
spectators
must
have
fidgeted
and
wished
the
actors
and
actresses
would
be
doing
something
very
like
indeed
the
spectators
then
as
now
would
no
doubt
have
preferred
farce
but
i
venture
to
think
the
explanation
is
not
complete
the
construction
of
the
play
is
weak
certainly
but
the
actors
and
actresses
do
a
great
deal
after
all
for
that
matter
audiences
will
stand
scenes
of
still
wit
but
they
like
to
comprehend
it
and
the
characters
in
way
of
the
or
most
of
them
represent
a
society
whose
attitude
and
speech
are
entirely
ironical
and
paradoxical
a
society
of
necessity
but
a
small
fraction
of
any
community
some
sort
of
study
or
some
special
experience
is
necessary
to
the
enjoyment
of
such
a
set
it
is
not
the
case
of
a
few
witticisms
and
paradoxes
firing
off
at
intervals
like
crackers
from
the
mouths
of
one
or
two
actors
with
whom
the
audience
is
taught
to
laugh
as
a
matter
of
course
the
vein
is
unbroken
now
literalness
and
common
sense
are
the
qualities
of
the
average
uninstructed
spectator
and
way
of
the
was
high
over
the
heads
of
its
audience
to
come
to
details
the
tragedy
of
lady
wishfort
has
often
been
remarked
the
veritable
tragedy
of
a
lovesick
old
woman
all
the
grotesque
touches
her
credulity
her
vanity
her
admirable
dialect
i
a
person
but
serve
to
make
the
tragedy
the
more
pitiable
either
therefore
our
appreciation
of
satiric
comedy
is
defective
or
congreve
made
a
mistake
to
regard
this
poor
old
soul
as
mere
comedy
is
to
attain
to
an
almost
satanic
height
of
contempt
the
comedy
is
more
than
grim
it
is
savagely
cruel
to
be
pitiless
on
the
other
hand
is
a
virtue
on
the
whole
we
may
reasonably
say
that
the
tragedy
is
not
too
keen
in
itself
but
that
it
is
too
obviously
indicated
witwoud
is
surely
a
great
character
the
stage
is
alive
with
mirth
when
he
is
on
it
his
entrance
in
the
very
first
part
of
the
play
is
delightful
me
your
compassion
my
dears
pity
me
fainall
mirabell
pity
me
fainall
how
does
your
lady
gad
i
say
anything
in
the
world
to
get
this
fellow
out
of
my
head
i
beg
pardon
that
i
should
ask
a
man
of
pleasure
and
the
town
a
question
at
once
so
foreign
and
domestic
but
i
talk
like
an
old
maid
at
a
marriage
i
do
know
what
i
say
but
one
might
quote
for
ever
witwoud
almost
as
much
as
millamant
herself
is
an
eternal
type
his
little
exclamations
his
assurance
of
sympathy
his
terror
of
the
commonplace
surely
one
knows
them
well
his
tolerance
of
any
impertinence
lest
he
should
be
thought
to
have
misunderstood
a
jest
is
a
great
distinction
but
congreve
gibe
in
the
dedication
at
the
critics
who
failed
distinguish
betwixt
the
character
of
a
witwoud
and
a
truewit
is
hardly
fair
as
dryden
said
of
etherege
sir
fopling
he
is
fool
so
nicely
writ
the
ladies
might
mistake
him
for
a
wit
then
millamant
is
the
ultimate
expression
of
those
who
having
all
the
material
goods
which
nature
and
civilisation
can
give
live
on
paradoxes
and
artifices
her
insolence
is
the
inoffensive
insolence
only
possible
to
the
ay
letters
i
had
letters
i
am
persecuted
with
letters
i
hate
letters
nobody
knows
how
to
write
letters
and
yet
one
has
one
does
not
know
why
they
serve
one
to
pin
up
one
hair
the
lover
gift
lord
what
is
a
lover
that
it
can
give
why
one
makes
lovers
as
fast
as
one
pleases
and
they
live
as
long
as
one
pleases
and
they
die
as
soon
as
one
pleases
and
then
if
one
pleases
one
makes
more
in
parts
of
its
characterisation
way
of
the
is
extremely
bold
in
observation
extremely
careless
of
literary
types
and
traditions
fainall
a
woman
who
is
the
friend
and
assists
in
the
intrigues
of
a
man
who
has
ceased
to
be
her
lover
is
most
unconventionally
human
of
all
the
inimitable
scenes
that
in
which
millamant
and
mirabell
make
their
conditions
of
marriage
is
perhaps
the
most
unquestionable
triumph
us
never
visit
together
nor
go
to
a
play
together
but
let
us
be
very
strange
and
there
is
its
keynote
the
dialogue
is
as
sure
and
perfect
in
diction
in
balance
of
phrases
and
in
musical
effectiveness
as
can
be
conceived
and
for
all
its
care
is
absolutely
free
in
its
gaiety
it
is
the
ultimate
expression
of
the
joys
of
the
artificial
as
for
the
prologue
it
is
an
invitation
to
the
dullards
to
damn
the
play
and
is
anything
but
serenely
confident
the
dedication
to
earl
of
mountague
has
an
interesting
fact
it
tells
us
that
the
comedy
was
written
immediately
after
staying
with
him
your
retirement
last
summer
from
the
town
and
pays
a
tribute
to
the
influence
of
the
society
the
dramatist
met
there
y
voyez
partout
said
voltaire
of
congreve
langage
des
honnetes
gens
avec
des
actions
de
fripon
ce
qui
prouve
connaissait
bien
son
monde
et
vivait
dans
ce
appelle
la
bonne
compagnie
the
want
of
dramatic
skill
which
has
been
alleged
against
congreve
is
simply
a
question
of
construction
of
the
construction
of
his
plays
as
a
whole
his
plots
hang
fire
are
difficult
to
follow
and
are
not
worth
remembering
but
many
things
besides
go
to
the
making
of
good
plays
and
few
playwrights
have
had
all
the
theatrical
virtues
do
we
not
pardon
a
lack
of
incident
in
a
novel
of
character
in
this
connexion
it
is
worth
while
to
contrast
congreve
with
sheridan
who
in
the
matter
of
construction
was
a
far
abler
craftsman
but
is
there
not
in
the
elder
poet
enough
to
turn
the
scale
even
the
theatrical
scale
ten
times
over
compare
the
petty
indignation
with
which
the
dramatist
of
school
for
deals
with
his
scandalmongers
and
the
amused
indifference
of
congreve
towards
the
cabalists
in
way
of
the
or
take
any
hero
of
congreve
and
contrast
him
with
that
glorification
of
vulgar
lavishness
and
canting
generosity
that
very
barmaid
hero
charles
surface
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
joseph
is
the
real
hero
but
sheridan
made
it
natural
for
the
stupid
sentimentality
of
later
days
to
make
him
the
villain
and
congreve
would
have
made
it
impossible
of
wit
of
course
there
is
more
in
a
scene
of
congreve
than
in
a
play
of
sheridan
moreover
faulty
in
construction
as
his
main
plots
are
in
detail
his
construction
is
often
admirable
as
in
play
of
character
upon
character
in
countless
opportunities
for
delightful
archness
and
cruelty
in
the
women
for
the
display
of
every
comic
emotion
in
the
men
he
lived
in
the
playhouse
and
his
characters
true
to
life
though
they
be
have
about
them
as
it
were
an
ideal
essence
of
the
boards
with
hazlitt
would
rather
have
seen
abington
millamant
than
any
rosalind
that
ever
appeared
on
the
stage
a
lover
and
a
constant
frequenter
of
the
theatre
albeit
the
plays
he
sees
bore
him
to
death
can
not
in
reading
congreve
choose
but
see
the
glances
and
hear
the
intonations
of
imaginary
players
vi
congreve
choice
of
material
has
been
defended
at
an
early
stage
of
these
remarks
there
is
the
further
and
more
interesting
question
of
his
point
of
view
his
attitude
towards
it
henley
speaks
of
his
and
unmitigable
baseness
of
morality
differing
with
deference
i
think
it
may
be
shown
that
his
attitude
is
a
pose
merely
and
an
artistic
and
quite
innocent
pose
it
is
the
amusing
pose
of
the
boyish
cynic
turned
into
an
artistic
convention
the
lines
alone
wo
betray
in
whom
none
will
confide
and
the
nymph
may
be
chaste
that
has
never
been
tried
which
conclude
the
characteristic
song
in
the
third
act
of
for
are
typical
of
his
attitude
does
anybody
suppose
that
an
intelligent
man
of
the
world
meant
that
sentiment
in
all
seriousness
new
besides
our
faces
every
woman
is
the
same
those
lines
in
his
first
play
which
seemed
so
shocking
to
thackeray
what
more
do
they
express
than
the
green
cynicism
of
youth
when
leslie
stephen
speaks
of
his
of
cynical
sentiment
he
speaks
unsympathetically
but
the
phrase
to
be
an
enemy
is
just
it
is
cynical
sentiment
and
the
hostility
comes
from
taking
it
seriously
i
think
it
the
most
artistic
attitude
for
a
writer
of
gay
satiric
comedies
and
that
its
very
excess
should
prevent
its
being
taken
for
more
than
a
convention
we
are
not
called
upon
to
see
satiric
comedies
all
day
long
and
the
question
everlastingly
asked
by
implication
of
every
work
of
art
you
like
to
live
with
it
is
here
as
in
most
other
cases
irrelevant
one
is
reminded
that
there
is
more
in
life
than
intrigues
and
cynical
comments
on
them
and
one
is
inclined
to
put
the
questions
in
answer
a
man
who
really
feels
the
sorrowful
things
of
life
its
futile
endeavours
and
piteous
separations
find
relief
in
seeing
his
emotions
mimicked
on
the
stage
in
a
play
of
sentiment
with
a
happy
ending
is
he
not
rather
comforted
by
the
distractions
of
cheerful
frivolity
of
conventional
denial
of
his
pains
the
demand
is
as
inartistic
and
irrelevant
as
the
criticism
which
suggested
it
but
it
returns
a
sufficient
reply
it
does
not
touch
the
of
tragedy
which
is
another
matter
for
the
rest
congreve
attitude
cynicism
apart
is
an
attitude
of
irony
and
superiority
over
common
emotions
the
attitude
artificial
and
inoffensive
of
the
society
he
depicts
in
his
greatest
play
he
enjoys
the
humours
of
his
puppets
he
is
never
angry
with
them
it
is
the
attitude
of
an
artist
in
expounding
human
nature
of
an
expert
in
observation
of
life
an
attitude
attainable
but
by
very
few
and
disliked
as
a
rule
by
the
rest
who
want
to
clap
or
to
hiss
who
can
laugh
but
who
can
not
smile
vii
when
congreve
left
the
stage
said
dennis
the
critic
left
it
with
him
vanburgh
and
farquhar
were
left
to
expound
comedy
of
manners
the
one
with
a
vigorous
gusto
the
other
with
a
romantic
gaiety
the
peculiar
perfume
of
way
of
the
was
given
to
neither
yet
they
wrote
comedy
of
manners
but
if
congreve
left
colleagues
he
left
no
sons
and
most
certainly
one
may
say
that
when
those
colleagues
died
english
comedy
took
to
her
bed
comic
muse
long
sick
is
now
dying
wrote
garrick
in
his
prologue
to
stoops
to
and
she
had
not
to
apologise
like
charles
the
second
for
the
unconscionable
time
she
was
about
it
it
is
a
little
crude
to
attribute
her
demise
to
jeremy
collier
and
his
a
block
painted
to
look
like
a
thunderbolt
it
is
not
a
matter
of
decency
of
alteration
or
improvement
in
manners
a
comedy
might
be
wholly
congrevean
without
a
coarse
word
from
beginning
to
end
it
is
a
matter
of
the
exclusion
not
the
stultification
the
suspension
of
moral
prepossessions
the
absence
of
sympathetic
sentimentalism
the
habit
of
shirking
nothing
and
smiling
at
all
things
these
qualities
are
not
characteristic
of
the
average
englishman
now
satiric
comedy
did
not
in
its
initiation
depend
upon
the
average
englishman
it
took
its
cue
from
the
court
of
charles
the
second
who
with
a
dash
of
thoroughly
english
humour
was
more
than
french
in
temperament
and
attracted
to
himself
all
that
was
artistically
frivolous
in
his
kingdom
questions
of
decency
and
morality
which
after
all
are
not
perpetually
amusing
apart
the
social
spirit
typified
in
this
exceptional
king
is
one
of
sceptical
humour
and
ironical
smiles
it
takes
common
emotions
for
granted
is
bored
by
them
in
fact
and
is
a
foe
to
sentimentality
and
gush
and
virtuously
happy
endings
it
was
the
spirit
of
charles
the
second
that
inspired
english
comedy
and
inspired
it
most
thoroughly
in
congreve
but
a
few
years
after
charles
death
under
changed
conditions
one
is
apt
to
underestimate
the
influence
of
the
court
upon
the
town
two
hundred
years
ago
well
the
georges
became
our
defenders
of
the
faith
and
they
hated
and
bainters
english
comedy
was
thrown
back
upon
the
patronage
and
the
inspiration
of
average
england
and
up
to
the
time
of
writing
has
shown
few
signs
of
recovery
of
course
the
decay
was
gradual
you
may
see
it
at
a
most
interesting
stage
in
school
for
a
comedy
of
manners
with
a
strong
dash
of
common
sentimentality
it
would
be
just
possible
one
conceives
to
play
school
for
as
charles
lamb
says
he
saw
it
played
with
joseph
for
a
hero
as
a
comedy
of
manners
you
can
just
imagine
sir
peter
as
a
sort
of
sir
paul
plyant
and
as
not
played
to
raise
a
lump
in
your
throat
but
sheridan
made
it
a
difficult
task
perhaps
you
may
see
the
evil
influence
at
its
worst
in
the
comedies
which
were
our
glory
years
ago
in
such
a
play
as
an
even
river
of
sloppy
sentiment
where
the
acme
of
chivalrous
delicacy
is
to
refrain
from
lighting
a
cigarette
in
a
woman
presence
where
the
triumph
of
humour
is
for
a
guardsman
to
take
a
kettle
off
the
fire
and
where
the
character
of
eccles
shows
what
excellent
comedy
the
author
might
alas
have
written
one
is
fain
to
ask
if
the
spirit
of
congrevean
comedy
will
ever
come
back
to
our
stage
an
echo
of
it
has
been
heard
in
dialogue
once
or
twice
in
the
last
few
years
not
a
trace
has
been
seen
in
action
and
yet
we
permit
our
dramatists
a
pretty
wide
range
of
subjects
we
allow
the
subjects
it
is
the
congrevean
attitude
towards
them
which
we
should
condemn
but
the
stage
would
be
all
the
merrier
if
we
could
only
understand
that
that
attitude
is
harmless
that
to
see
the
humorous
aspect
of
a
thing
is
not
to
ignore
the
pathetic
or
the
sociological
and
that
we
should
return
all
the
heartier
to
our
serious
and
sentimental
considerations
of
the
problems
of
life
for
allowing
them
to
be
laughed
at
for
an
evening
at
a
comedy
meantime
we
can
read
the
book
street

old

to
the
right
honourable
charles
lord
clifford
of
lanesborough
etc
my
lord
it
is
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
that
i
lay
hold
on
this
first
occasion
which
the
accidents
of
my
life
have
given
me
of
writing
to
your
lordship
for
since
at
the
same
time
i
write
to
all
the
world
it
will
be
a
means
of
publishing
what
i
would
have
everybody
know
the
respect
and
duty
which
i
owe
and
pay
to
you
i
have
so
much
inclination
to
be
yours
that
i
need
no
other
engagement
but
the
particular
ties
by
which
i
am
bound
to
your
lordship
and
family
have
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
make
you
any
compliment
since
all
offers
of
myself
will
amount
to
no
more
than
an
honest
acknowledgment
and
only
shew
a
willingness
in
me
to
be
grateful
i
am
very
near
wishing
that
it
were
not
so
much
my
interest
to
be
your
lordship
servant
that
it
might
be
more
my
merit
not
that
i
would
avoid
being
obliged
to
you
but
i
would
have
my
own
choice
to
run
me
into
the
debt
that
i
might
have
it
to
boast
i
had
distinguished
a
man
to
whom
i
would
be
glad
to
be
obliged
even
without
the
hopes
of
having
it
in
my
power
ever
to
make
him
a
return
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
come
near
your
lordship
in
any
kind
and
not
to
receive
some
favour
and
while
in
appearance
i
am
only
making
an
acknowledgment
with
the
usual
underhand
dealing
of
the
world
i
am
at
the
same
time
insinuating
my
own
interest
i
can
not
give
your
lordship
your
due
without
tacking
a
bill
of
my
own
privileges
is
true
if
a
man
never
committed
a
folly
he
would
never
stand
in
need
of
a
protection
but
then
power
would
have
nothing
to
do
and
good
nature
no
occasion
to
show
itself
and
where
those
qualities
are
is
pity
they
should
want
objects
to
shine
upon
i
must
confess
this
is
no
reason
why
a
man
should
do
an
idle
thing
nor
indeed
any
good
excuse
for
it
when
done
yet
it
reconciles
the
uses
of
such
authority
and
goodness
to
the
necessities
of
our
follies
and
is
a
sort
of
poetical
logic
which
at
this
time
i
would
make
use
of
to
argue
your
lordship
into
a
protection
of
this
play
it
is
the
first
offence
i
have
committed
in
this
kind
or
indeed
in
any
kind
of
poetry
though
not
the
first
made
public
and
therefore
i
hope
will
the
more
easily
be
pardoned
but
had
it
been
acted
when
it
was
first
written
more
might
have
been
said
in
its
behalf
ignorance
of
the
town
and
stage
would
then
have
been
excuses
in
a
young
writer
which
now
almost
four
years
experience
will
scarce
allow
of
yet
i
must
declare
myself
sensible
of
the
good
nature
of
the
town
in
receiving
this
play
so
kindly
with
all
its
faults
which
i
must
own
were
for
the
most
part
very
industriously
covered
by
the
care
of
the
players
for
i
think
scarce
a
character
but
received
all
the
advantage
it
would
admit
of
from
the
justness
of
the
action
as
for
the
critics
my
lord
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
or
against
any
of
them
of
any
kind
from
those
who
make
just
exceptions
to
those
who
find
fault
in
the
wrong
place
i
will
only
make
this
general
answer
in
behalf
of
my
play
an
answer
which
epictetus
advises
every
man
to
make
for
himself
to
his
censurers
viz
if
they
who
find
some
faults
in
it
were
as
intimate
with
it
as
i
am
they
would
find
a
great
many
more
this
is
a
confession
which
i
needed
not
to
have
made
but
however
i
can
draw
this
use
from
it
to
my
own
advantage
that
i
think
there
are
no
faults
in
it
but
what
i
do
know
which
as
i
take
it
is
the
first
step
to
an
amendment
thus
i
may
live
in
hopes
sometime
or
other
of
making
the
town
amends
but
you
my
lord
i
never
can
though
i
am
ever
your
lordship
most
obedient
and
most
humble
servant
will
congreve
to
congreve
when
virtue
in
pursuit
of
fame
appears
and
forward
shoots
the
growth
beyond
the
years
we
timely
court
the
rising
hero
cause
and
on
his
side
the
poet
wisely
draws
bespeaking
him
hereafter
by
applause
the
days
will
come
when
we
shall
all
receive
returning
interest
from
what
now
we
give
instructed
and
supported
by
that
praise
and
reputation
which
we
strive
to
raise
nature
so
coy
so
hardly
to
be
wooed
flies
like
a
mistress
but
to
be
pursued
o
congreve
boldly
follow
on
the
chase
she
looks
behind
and
wants
thy
strong
embrace
she
yields
she

surrenders
all
her
charms

you
but
force
her

a

not
to

which
he
alone
could
gain
his

it
not

submit
to

leaving
his
deathless

to

is
something
to
be
willing
to
commend
but
my
best
praise
is
that
i
am
your
friend
tho
southerne
to
congreve
the
danger
great
in
these
censorious
days
when
critics
are
so
rife
to
venture
praise
when
the
infectious
and
brood
behold
and
damn
the
work
because
is
good
and
with
a
proud
ungenerous
spirit
try
to
pass
an
ostracism
on
poetry
but
you
my
friend
your
worth
does
safely
bear
above
their
spleen
you
have
no
cause
for
fear
like
a
hawk
you
took
your
flight
quite
out
of
reach
and
almost
out
of
sight
as
the
strong
sun
in
a
fair
summer
day
you
rise
and
drive
the
mists
and
clouds
away
the
owls
and
bats
and
all
the
birds
of
prey
each
line
of
yours
like
polished
steel
so
hard
in
beauty
safe
it
wants
no
other
guard
nature
herself
beholden
to
your
dress
which
though
still
like
much
fairer
you
express
some
vainly
striving
honour
to
obtain
leave
to
their
heirs
the
traffic
of
their
brain
like
china
under
ground
the
ripening
ware
in
a
long
time
perhaps
grows
worth
our
care
but
you
now
reap
the
fame
so
well
you
sown
the
planter
tastes
his
fruit
to
ripeness
grown
as
a
fair
at

big
with
what
ripe
yet
springing

with
green
so
at
one
time
my
worthy
friend
appears
with
all
the
sap
of
youth
and
weight
of
years
accept
my
pious
love
as
forward
zeal
which
though
it

me

prologue

for
the
old
bachelor
written
by
the
lord
falkland
most
authors
on
the
stage
at
first
appear
like
widows
bridegrooms
full
of
doubt
and
fear
they
judge
from
the
experience
of
the
dame
how
hard
a
task
it
is
to
quench
her
flame
and
who
falls
short
of
furnishing
a
course
up
to
his
brawny
predecessor
force
with
utmost
rage
from
her
embraces
thrown
remains
convicted
as
an
empty
drone
thus
often
to
his
shame
a
pert
beginner
proves
in
the
end
a
miserable
sinner
as
for
our
youngster
i
am
apt
to
doubt
him
with
all
the
vigour
of
his
youth
about
him
but
he
more
sanguine
trusts
in
one
and
twenty
and
impudently
hopes
he
shall
content
you
for
though
his
bachelor
be
worn
and
cold
he
thinks
the
young
may
club
to
help
the
old
and
what
alone
can
be
achieved
by
neither
is
often
brought
about
by
both
together
the
briskest
of
you
all
have
felt
alarms
finding
the
fair
one
prostitute
her
charms
with
broken
sighs
in
her
old
fumbler
arms
but
for
our
spark
he
swears
he
be
jealous
of
any
rivals
but
young
lusty
fellows
faith
let
him
try
his
chance
and
if
the
slave
after
his
bragging
prove
a
washy
knave
may
he
be
banished
to
some
lonely
den
and
never
more
have
leave
to
dip
his
pen
but
if
he
be
the
champion
he
pretends
both
sexes
sure
will
join
to
be
his
friends
for
all

where
all
can

the
third
night
prologue
spoken
by
bracegirdle
how
this
vile
world
is
changed
in
former
days
prologues
were
serious
speeches
before
plays
grave
solemn
things
as
graces
are
to
feasts
where
poets
begged
a
blessing
from
their
guests
but
now
no
more
like
suppliants
we
come
a
play
makes
war
and
prologue
is
the
drum
armed
with
keen
satire
and
with
pointed
wit
we
threaten
you
who
do
for
judges
sit
to
save
our
plays
or
else
we
damn
your
pit
but
for
your
comfort
it
falls
out
we
a
young
author
and
his
play
so
standing
only
on
his
good
behaviour
he
very
civil
and
entreats
your
favour
not
but
the
man
has
malice
would
he
show
it
but
on
my
conscience
he
a
bashful
poet
you
think
that
strange
no
matter
he
outgrow
it
well
i
his
advocate
by
me
he
prays
you
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
speak
to
please
you
he
prays
o
bless
me
what
shall
i
do
now
hang
me
if
i
know
what
he
prays
or
how
and
was
the
prettiest
prologue
as
he
wrote
it
well
the
deuce
take
me
if
i
ha
forgot
it
o
lord
for
sake
excuse
the
play
because
you
know
if
it
be
damned
i
shall
be
hanged
for
wanting
what
to
say
for
my
sake
then

how
canst
thou
be
ungrateful
to

extremely
pretty
and
loves
thee

i
have
heard
her
breathe
such
raptures
about
thee

never

true
by

she
owned
it
to
my
face

blushing
like
the
virgin
morn
when
it
disclosed
the
cheat
which
that
trusty
bawd
of

had
hid
confessed
her
soul
was
true
to
you
though
i
by
treachery
had
stolen
the
bliss
vain
so
was
true
as
turtle
in
imagination
ned
ha
preach
this
doctrine
to
husbands
and
the
married
women
will
adore
thee
bell
why
faith
i
think
it
will
do
well
enough
if
the
husband
be
out
of
the
way
for
the
wife
to
show
her
fondness
and
impatience
of
his
absence
by
choosing
a
lover
as
like
him
as
she
can
and
what
is
unlike
she
may
help
out
with
her
own
fancy
vain
but
is
it
not
an
abuse
to
the
lover
to
be
made
a
blind
of
bell
as
you
say
the
abuse
is
to
the
lover
not
the
husband
for
is
an
argument
of
her
great
zeal
towards
him
that
she
will
enjoy
him
in
effigy
vain
it
must
be
a
very
superstitious
country
where
such
zeal
passes
for
true
devotion
i
doubt
it
will
be
damned
by
all
our
protestant
husbands
for
flat
idolatry
but
if
you
can
make
alderman
fondlewife
of
your
persuasion
this
letter
will
be
needless
bell
what
the
old
banker
with
the
handsome
wife
vain
ay
bell
let
me
see
oh
is
a
delicious
morsel
dear
frank
thou
art
the
truest
friend
in
the
world
vain
ay
am
i
not
to
be
continually
starting
of
hares
for
you
to
course
we
were
certainly
cut
out
for
one
another
for
my
temper
quits
an
amour
just
where
thine
takes
it
up
but
read
that
it
is
an
appointment
for
me
this
evening
when
fondlewife
will
be
gone
out
of
town
to
meet
the
master
of
a
ship
about
the
return
of
a
venture
which
he
in
danger
of
losing
read
read
bell
hum
hum
out
of
town
this
evening
and
talks
of
sending
for
spintext
to
keep
me
company
but
i
take
care
he
shall
not
be
at
home
good
spintext
oh
the
fanatic
parson
vain
ay
bell
hum
hum
that
your
conversation
will
be
much
more
agreeable
if
you
can
counterfeit
his
habit
to
blind
the
servants
very
good
then
i
must
be
disguised
with
all
my
heart
it
adds
a
gusto
to
an
amour
gives
it
the
greater
resemblance
of
theft
and
among
us
lewd
mortals
the
deeper
the
sin
the
sweeter
frank
i
amazed
at
thy
good
nature
vain
faith
i
hate
love
when
is
forced
upon
a
man
as
i
do
wine
and
this
business
is
none
of
my
seeking
i
only
happened
to
be
once
or
twice
where
laetitia
was
the
handsomest
woman
in
company
so
consequently
applied
myself
to
her
and
it
seems
she
has
taken
me
at
my
word
had
you
been
there
or
anybody
had
been
the
same
bell
i
wish
i
may
succeed
as
the
same
vain
never
doubt
it
for
if
the
spirit
of
cuckoldom
be
once
raised
up
in
a
woman
the
devil
ca
lay
it
until
she
has
bell
prithee
what
sort
of
fellow
is
fondlewife
vain
a
kind
of
mongrel
zealot
sometimes
very
precise
and
peevish
but
i
have
seen
him
pleasant
enough
in
his
way
much
addicted
to
jealousy
but
more
to
fondness
so
that
as
he
is
often
jealous
without
a
cause
he
as
often
satisfied
without
reason
bell
a
very
even
temper
and
fit
for
my
purpose
i
must
get
your
man
setter
to
provide
my
disguise
vain
ay
you
may
take
him
for
good
and
all
if
you
will
for
you
have
made
him
fit
for
nobody
else
well
bell
you
going
to
visit
in
return
of
sylvia
letter
poor
rogue
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
will
serve
her
but
do
you
know
nothing
of
a
new
rival
there
vain
yes
heartwell
that
surly
old
pretended
thinks
her
virtuous
that
one
reason
why
i
fail
her
i
would
have
her
fret
herself
out
of
conceit
with
me
that
she
may
entertain
some
thoughts
of
him
i
know
he
visits
her
every
day
bell
yet
rails
on
still
and
thinks
his
love
unknown
to
us
a
little
time
will
swell
him
so
he
must
be
forced
to
give
it
birth
and
the
discovery
must
needs
be
very
pleasant
from
himself
to
see
what
pains
he
will
take
and
how
he
will
strain
to
be
delivered
of
a
secret
when
he
has
miscarried
of
it
already
vain
well
let
dine
together
i
meet
at
the
old
place
bell
with
all
my
heart
it
lies
convenient
for
us
to
pay
our
afternoon
services
to
our
mistresses
i
find
i
am
damnably
in
love
i
so
uneasy
for
not
having
seen
belinda
yesterday
vain
but
i
saw
my
araminta
yet
am
as
impatient
scene
ii
bellmour
bell
why
what
a
cormorant
in
love
am
i
who
not
contented
with
the
slavery
of
honourable
love
in
one
place
and
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
some
half
a
score
mistresses
of
my
own
acquiring
must
yet
take
vainlove
business
upon
my
hands
because
it
lay
too
heavy
upon
his
so
am
not
only
forced
to
lie
with
other
men
wives
for
but
must
also
undertake
the
harder
task
of
obliging
their
mistresses
i
must
take
up
or
i
shall
never
hold
out
flesh
and
blood
can
not
bear
it
always
scene
iii
sharper
sharp
i
sorry
to
see
this
ned
once
a
man
comes
to
his
soliloquies
i
give
him
for
gone
bell
sharper
i
glad
to
see
thee
sharp
what
is
belinda
cruel
that
you
are
so
thoughtful
bell
no
faith
not
for
that
but
there
a
business
of
consequence
fallen
out
that
requires
some
consideration
sharp
prithee
what
mighty
business
of
consequence
canst
thou
have
bell
why
you
must
know
is
a
piece
of
work
toward
the
finishing
of
an
alderman
it
seems
i
must
put
the
last
hand
to
it
and
dub
him
cuckold
that
he
may
be
of
equal
dignity
with
the
rest
of
his
brethren
so
i
must
beg
belinda
pardon
sharp
faith
give
her
over
for
good
and
all
you
can
have
no
hopes
of
getting
her
for
a
mistress
and
she
is
too
proud
too
inconstant
too
affected
and
too
witty
and
too
handsome
for
a
wife
bell
but
she
ca
have
too
much
money
there
twelve
thousand
pound
tom
is
true
she
is
excessively
foppish
and
affected
but
in
my
conscience
i
believe
the
baggage
loves
me
for
she
never
speaks
well
of
me
herself
nor
suffers
anybody
else
to
rail
at
me
then
as
i
told
you
there
twelve
thousand
pound
hum
why
faith
upon
second
thoughts
she
does
not
appear
to
be
so
very
affected
give
her
her
due
i
think
the
woman
a
woman
and
that
all
as
such
i
sure
i
shall
like
her
for
the
devil
take
me
if
i
do
love
all
the
sex
sharp
and
here
comes
one
who
swears
as
heartily
he
hates
all
the
sex

heartwell

he
knows
better
things

now

where
hast
thou
been
snarling
odious
truths

entertaining
company
like
a
physician
with
discourse
of
their
diseases
and
infirmities
what
fine
lady
hast
thou
been
putting
out
of
conceit
with
herself
and
persuading
that
the
face
she
had
been
making
all
the
morning
was
none
of
her
own
for
i
know
thou
art
as
unmannerly
and
as
unwelcome
to
a
woman
as
a
after
the
smallpox
heart
i
confess
i
have
not
been
sneering
fulsome
lies
and
nauseous
flattery
fawning
upon
a
little
tawdry
whore
that
will
fawn
upon
me
again
and
entertain
any
puppy
that
comes
like
a
tumbler
with
the
same
tricks
over

over
for
such
i
guess
may
have
been
your
late
employment

thy
conversion

one

fools
is
always
upon
some
errand
that
to
no
purpose
ever
embarking
in
adventures
yet
never
comes
to
harbour
sharp
that
because
he
always
sets
out
in
foul
weather
loves
to
buffet
with
the
winds
meet
the
tide
and
sail
in
the
teeth
of
opposition

has
he
not
dropt

at

truth
o
is
she
fits
his
temper
best

a
kind
of
floating
island
sometimes
seems
in
reach
then
vanishes
and
keeps
him
busied
in
the
search
sharp
she
had
need
have
a
good
share
of
sense
to
manage
so
capricious
a
lover
bell
faith
i
do
know
he
of
a
temper
the
most
easy
to
himself
in
the
world
he
takes
as
much
always
of
an
amour
as
he
cares
for
and
quits
it
when
it
grows
stale
or
unpleasant

argument

very
little
passion

good
understanding
and
very
ill
nature

proves
that
vainlove
plays
the
fool
with
discretion

are
bound
in
gratitude
to
stickle
for
him

with
pleasure
reap
that
fruit
which
he
takes
pains
to
sow

does
the
drudgery
in
the
mine

stamp
your
image

says
i
do
the
drudgery
in
the
mine
well
we
have
each
our
share
of
sport
and
each
that
which
he
likes
best
his
diversion
to
set
is
mine
to
cover
the
partridge
heart
and
it
should
be
mine
to
let
go
again

not
till
you
had
mouthed

little
george

think
that
all
thou
art
fit
for

good

mistaken
as
able
as
yourself

as
nimble

though
i
may
have
so
much
mercury
in
my
limbs
is
true
indeed
i
do
force
appetite

wait
the
natural
call
of
my
lust

think
it
time
enough
to
be
lewd
after
i
have
had
the
temptation
bell
time
enough

too
soon
i
should
rather
have
expected
from
a
person
of
your
gravity
heart

it
is
oftentimes
too
late
with
some
of
you
young
termagant
flashy
sinners
you
have
all
the
guilt
of
the
intention
and
none
of
the
pleasure
of
the
practice
is
true
you
are
so
eager
in
pursuit
of
the
temptation
that
you
save
the
devil
the
trouble
of
leading
you
into
it
nor
is
it
out
of
discretion
that
you
do
swallow
that
very
hook
yourselves
have
baited
but
you
are
cloyed
with
the
preparative
and
what
you
mean
for
a
whet
turns
the
edge
of
your
puny
stomachs
your
love
is
like
your
courage
which
you
show
for
the
first
year
or
two
upon
all
occasions
till
in
a
little
time
being
disabled

disarmed
you
abate
of
your
vigour

that
daring
blade
which
was
so
often
drawn
is
bound
to
the
peace
for
ever
after
bell
thou
art
an
old
fornicator
of
a
singular
good
principle
indeed
and
art
for
encouraging
youth
that
they
may
be
as
wicked
as
thou
art
at
thy
years
heart
i
am
for
having
everybody
be
what
they
pretend
to
be
a
whoremaster
be
a
whoremaster

not
like
vainlove
kiss
a
with
passion

it
would
disgust
him
from
the
lady
own
lips
bell
that
only
happens
sometimes
where
the
dog
has
the
sweeter
breath
for
the
more
cleanly
conveyance
but
george
you
must
not
quarrel
with
little
gallantries
of
this
nature
women
are
often
won
by
who
would
refuse
to
kiss
a
if
it
were
preliminary
to
the
lips
of
his
lady
sharp
or
omit
playing
with
her
fan
and
cooling
her
if
she
were
hot
when
it
might
entitle
him
to
the
office
of
warming
her

she
should
be
cold

what
is
it
to
read
a
play
in
a
rainy
day

you
should
be
now

then
interrupted

witty
scene

she
perhaps
preserve
her
laughter

the
jest
were
over

that
may
be
borne
with
considering
the
reward
in

confess
you

greater

the
drudgery

loving
to
boot
bell
o
brute
the
drudgery
of
loving
heart
ay
why
to
come
to
love
through
all
these
incumbrances
is
like
coming
to
an
estate
overcharged
with
debts
which
by
the
time
you
have
paid
yields
no
further
profit
than
what
the
bare
tillage

produce

expense
of

how
dost
thou

hates

so
i
hate
physic

well
come
off
george

at
any

you
should
be
taken
straying

he
has
need
of
such
an
excuse
considering
the
present
state
of
his
body
heart
how
d
mean
sharp
why
if
whoring
be
purging
as
you
call
it

i
may
say
marriage
is
entering

course

how
george
does
the
wind
blow
there

it
will
as
soon
blow
north

by
south
marry
quotha
i
hope
in
heaven
i
have
a
greater
portion
of
grace
and
i
think
i
have
baited
too
many
of
those
traps
to
be
caught
in
one
myself

who
the
devil
would
have
thee
unless
an
oysterwoman

propagate
young
fry
for
billingsgate
thy
talent
will
never
recommend
thee
to
anything
of
better
quality
heart
my
talent
is
chiefly
that
of
speaking
truth
which
i
do
expect
should
ever
recommend
me
to
people
of

i
thank
heaven
i
have
very
honestly
purchased
the
hatred
of
all
the
great
families
in
town
sharp
and
you
in
return
of
spleen
hate
them
but
could
you
hope
to
be
received

question
to

have
prattled
away

time
i
hope
you
are
in
no
haste
for
an
answer

i
sha
stay
now
on
his
bell
nay
prithee
george
heart
no
besides
my
business
i
see
a
fool
coming
this
way
adieu
scene
sharper
bellmour
bell
what
does
he
mean
oh
is
sir
joseph
wittoll
with
his
friend
but
i
see
he
has
turned
the
corner
and
goes
another
way
sharp
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
is
it
bell
why
a
fool
sharp
is
a
tawdry
outside
bell
and
a
very
beggarly
lining
yet
he
may
be
worth
your
acquaintance
a
little
of
thy
chymistry
tom
may
extract
gold
from
that
dirt
sharp
say
you
so
i
am
as
poor
as
a
chymist
and
would
be
as
industrious
but
what
was
he
that
followed
him
is
not
he
a
dragon
that
watches
those
golden
pippins
bell
hang
him
no
he
a
dragon
if
he
be
is
a
very
peaceful
one
i
can
ensure
his
anger
dormant
or
should
he
seem
to
rouse
is
but
well
lashing
him
and
he
will
sleep
like
a
top
sharp
ay
is
he
of
that
kidney
bell
yet
is
adored
by
that
bigot
sir
joseph
wittoll
as
the
image
of
valour
he
calls
him
his
back
and
indeed
they
are
never
asunder
yet
last
night
i
know
not
by
what
mischance
the
knight
was
alone
and
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
who
i
suppose
would
have
pillaged
him
but
i
chanced
to
come
by
and
rescued
him
though
i
believe
he
was
heartily
frightened
for
as
soon
as
ever
he
was
loose
he
ran
away
without
staying
to
see
who
had
helped
him
sharp
is
that
bully
of
his
in
the
army
bell
no
but
is
a
pretender
and
wears
the
habit
of
a
soldier
which
nowadays
as
often
cloaks
cowardice
as
a
black
gown
does
atheism
you
must
know
he
has
been
abroad
went
purely
to
run
away
from
a
campaign
enriched
himself
with
the
plunder
of
a
few
oaths
and
here
vents
them
against
the
general
who
slighting
men
of
merit
and
preferring
only
those
of
interest
has
made
him
quit
the
service
sharp
wherein
no
doubt
he
magnifies
his
own
performance
bell
speaks
miracles
is
the
drum
to
his
own
praise
the
only
implement
of
a
soldier
he
resembles
like
that
being
full
of
blustering
noise
and
emptiness
sharp
and
like
that
of
no
use
but
to
be
beaten
bell
right
but
then
the
comparison
breaks
for
he
will
take
a
drubbing
with
as
little
noise
as
a
pulpit
cushion
sharp
his
name
and
i
have
done
bell
why
that
to
pass
it
current
too
he
has
gilded
with
a
title

is
called

the

gentleman

i
make

frighted
it
out
of
my

sir
i
most
submissively
implore
your
pardon
for
my
transgression
of
ingratitude
and
omission
having
my
entire
dependence
sir
upon
the
superfluity
of
your
goodness
which
like
an
inundation
will
i
hope
totally
immerge
the
recollection
of
my
error

leave
me
floating
in
your
sight
upon

bladders
of
repentance
by
the
help

once

the
greatest
extremity

by

in
health
winter

summer
all
seasons

age
let
me
embrace
you
sir

o
lord
sir
sharp
my
loss
i
esteem
as
a
trifle
repaid
with
interest
since
it
has
purchased
me
the
friendship
and
acquaintance
of
the
person
in
the
world
whose
character
i
admire
sir
jo
you
are
only
pleased
to
say
so
sir
but
pray
if
i
may
be
so
bold
what
is
that
loss
you
mention
sharp
oh
term
it
no
longer
so
sir
in
the
scuffle
last
night
i
only
dropt
a
bill
of
a
hundred
pound

i
confess
i
came
half
despairing
to
recover
but
thanks
to
my
better
fortune
sir
jo
you
have
found
it
sir
then
it
seems
i
profess
i
heartily
glad
sharp
sir
your
humble
servant
i
do
question
but
you
are
that
you
have
so
cheap
an
opportunity
of
expressing
your
gratitude
and
generosity
since
the
paying
so
trivial
a
sum
will
wholly
acquit
you
and
doubly
engage
me
sir
jo
what
a
dickens
does
he
mean
by
a
trivial
sum
but
you
found
it
sir
sharp
no
otherwise
i
vow
to
gad
but
in
my
hopes
in
you
sir
sir
jo
humh

that
sufficient
injustice
to
doubt
the
honour
of
sir
joseph
wittoll
sir
jo
o
lord
sir

you
are
above
i
sure
a
thought
so
low
to
suffer

to
lose
what
was
ventured
in
your
service
nay
was
in
a
manner
paid
down
for
your
deliverance
was
so
much
lent
you
and
you
scorn
i
say
that
for
you
sir
jo
nay
i
say
that
for
myself
with
your
leave
sir
i
do
scorn
a
dirty
thing
but
agad
i
a
little
out
of
pocket
at
present
sharp
pshaw
you
ca
want
a
hundred
pound
your
word
is
sufficient
anywhere

acres

soon
repay
it
money

but
dirt
sir

mere
dirt

a
better
jest

lost
a
good
jest

a
hundred

to
lose

a
damned
hot
fellow
only
as
i
was
saying
i
let
him

all
my
ready
money
to

his
great
sword
from

religion

a
very
pretty
fellow
in
those
days
it
must
be
granted
but
alas
sir
were
he
alive
now
he

last
campaign

a
small
post

scarce
anything
of
moment
done
but
an
humble
servant
of
yours
that
shall
be
nameless

an
of

not
once
by
the
wars
took
no
more
notice

impudent
rogue

malicious
now

i
witness

i

so
fortune
be

to
find
you
both
within

is
aram
no
miracle
i
hope
bell
not
o
your
side
madam
i
confess
but
my
tyrant
there
and
i
are
two
buckets
that
can
never
come
together
belin
nor
are
ever
like
yet
we
often
meet
and
clash
bell
how
never
like
marry
hymen

but
this
it
is
to
run
so
extravagantly
in
debt
i
have
laid
out
such
a
world
of
love
in
your
service
that
you
think
you
can
never
be
able
to
pay
me
all
so
shun
me
for
the
same
reason
that
you
would
a
dun
belin
ay
on
my
conscience
and
the
most
impertinent
and
troublesome
of
duns
a
dun
for
money
will
be
quiet
when
he
sees
his
debtor
has
not
wherewithal
but
a
dun
for
love
is
an
eternal
torment
that
never
rests
bell
until
he
has
created
love
where
there
was
none
and
then
gets
it
for
his
pains
for
importunity
in
love
like
importunity
at
court
first
creates
its
own
interest
and
then
pursues
it
for
the
favour
aram
favours
that
are
got
by
impudence
and
importunity
are
like
discoveries
from
the
rack
when
the
afflicted
person
for
his
ease
sometimes
confesses
secrets
his
heart
knows
nothing
of
vain
i
should
rather
think
favours
so
gained
to
be
due
rewards
to
indefatigable
devotion
for
as
love
is
a
deity
he
must
be
served
by
prayer
belin
o

would
you
would
all
pray
to
love
then
and
let
us
alone
vain
you
are
the
temples
of
love
and
is
through
you
our
devotion
must
be
conveyed

rather
poor
silly
idols
of
your
own
making
which
upon
the
least
displeasure
you
forsake
and
set
up
new
every
man
now
changes
his

his

his

varies

his

o

i
find
we
are
growing
serious

then
we
are
in
great
danger
of
being
dull
if
my
be
not
gone
i
entertain
you
with
a
new
song
which
comes
pretty
near
my
own
opinion
of
love
and
your

who
there
is

gone

only
to

you
said

once

if
you
must
talk
impertinently
for
heaven
sake
let
it
be
with
variety
do
come
always
like
the
devil
wrapt
in
flames
i
not
hear
a
sentence
more
that
begins
with
an
burn
or
an
beseech
you
madam
bell
but
tell
me
how
you
would
be
adored
i
am
very
tractable
belin
then
know
i
would
be
adored
in
silence
bell
humph
i
thought
so
that
you
might
have
all
the
talk
to
yourself
you
had
better
let
me
speak
for
if
my
thoughts
fly
to
any
pitch
i
shall
make
villainous
signs
belin
what
will
you
get
by
that
to
make
such
signs
as
i

but
if
i
i
must
have
all
my
actions
free
to
quicken
your
apprehension

i

let
me
tell
you
my
most
prevailing
argument
is
expressed
in
dumb
show
scene
ix
aram
oh
i
am
glad
we
shall
have
a
song
to
divert
the
discourse
pray
oblige
us
with
the
last
new
song
song
i
thus
to
a
ripe
consenting
maid
poor
old
repenting
delia
said
would
you
long
preserve
your
lover
would
you
still
his
goddess
reign
never
let
him
all
discover
never
let
him
much
obtain
ii
men
will
admire
adore
and
die
while
wishing
at
your
feet
they
lie
but
admitting
their
embraces
wakes
from
the
golden
dream
nothing
new
besides
our
faces
every
woman
is
the
same
aram
so
how
like
the
song
gentlemen
bell
oh
very
well
performed
but
i
do
much
admire
the
words
aram
i
expected
it
there
too
much
truth
in
if
gavot
will
walk
with
us
in
the
garden
we
have
it
once
again
you
may
like
it
better
at
second
hearing
you
bring
my
cousin
bell

i
dare
not
speak
to
her
but
i
make
signs
belinda
in
dumb
belin
oh
foh
your
dumb
rhetoric
is
more
ridiculous
than
your
talking
impertinence
as
an
ape
is
a
much
more
troublesome
animal
than
a
parrot
aram
ay
cousin
and
is
a
sign
the
creatures
mimic
nature
well
for
there
are
few
men
but
do
more
silly
things
than
they
say
bell
well
i
find
my
apishness
has
paid
the
ransom
for
my
speech
and
set
it
at
liberty
though
i
confess
i
could
be
well
enough
pleased
to
drive
on
a
in
that
silent
manner
save
a
man
a
world
of
lying
and
swearing
at
the
year
end
besides
i
have
had
a
little
experience
that
brings
to
mind
when
wit
and
reason
both
have
failed
to
move
kind
looks

actions
from

even

if
this

it
is
madness

then
it
is

nay
yet
a
more
certain
sign
than
all
this
i
give
thee
my
money
silv

that
is
no

for
they

gentlemen
will
give

to
any
naughty

to
come

to
them
o
gemini
i
hope
you
mean
so
for
i
wo
be
a

heart
the
more
is
the
pity
silv
nay
if
you
would
marry
me
you
should
not
come
to
bed
to
me
you
have
such
a
beard
and
would
so
prickle
one
but
do
you
intend
to
marry
me
heart
that
a
fool
should
ask
such
a
malicious
question
death
i
shall
be
drawn
in
before
i
know
where
i
am
however
i
find
i
am
pretty
sure
of
her
consent
if
i
am
put
to
it
marry
you
no
no
love
you
silv
nay
but
if
you
love
me
you
must
marry
me
what
do
i
know
my
father
loved
my
mother
and
was
married
to
her
heart
ay
ay
in
old
days
people
married
where
they
loved
but
that
fashion
is
changed
child
silv
never
tell
me
that
i
know
it
is
not
changed
by
myself
for
i
love
you
and
would
marry
you
heart
i
have
my
beard
shaved
it
hurt
thee
and
we
go
to
bed
silv
no
no
i
not
such
a
fool
neither
but
i
can
keep
myself
honest
here
i
wo
keep
anything
that
yours
i
hate
you
now
the
and
i
never
see
you
again
you
have
me

naught
heart
damn
her
let
her
go
and
a
good
riddance
yet
so
much
tenderness
and
beauty
and
honesty
together
is
a
jewel
stay
silvia
but
then
to
marry
why
every
man
plays
the
fool
once
in
his
life
but
to
marry
is
playing
the
fool
all
one
life
long
silv
what
did
you
call
me
for
heart
i
give
thee
all
i
have
and
thou
shalt
live
with
me
in
everything
so
like
my
wife
the
world
shall
believe
it
nay
thou
shalt
think
so
thyself
only
let
me
not
think
so
silv
no
i
die
before
i
be
your

as
well
as
i
love
you
heart
a
woman
and
ignorant
may
be
honest
when
is
out

contradiction
but
it
is

upon
scurvy
terms
well
farewell
then
if

can
get

i
may
get
the

silv
well
and

come

kiss
at
parting
by

her
kiss
is
sweeter
than
liberty
i
will
marry
thee
there
thou
hast
all
my
resolves
melted
in
that
kiss
one

when

impatient
until

i
will
not
give

oh

possessed

farewell
five

how
that

stay
did
you
leave

you

his

with

i

comfort
will
send

hither
as
soon
as
ever
he
comes

i
could
have
brought

kept
my

company
in

but
you
say
fond
how
how
say
varlet
i
say
let
him
not
come
near
my

i
say
he
is
a
wanton
young
levite
and
pampereth
himself
up
with
dainties
that
he
may
look
lovely
in
the
eyes
of
women
sincerely
i
am
afraid
he
hath
already
defiled
the
tabernacle
of
our
sister
comfort
while
her
good
husband
is
deluded
by
his
godly
appearance
i
say
that
even
lust
doth
sparkle
in
his
eyes
and
glow
upon
his
cheeks
and
that
i
would
as
soon
trust
my
wife
with
a
lord
chaplain
bar
sir
the
hour
draws
nigh
and
nothing
will
be
done
here
until
you
come

and
nothing
can
be
done
here
until
i
go
so
that
i
tarry
see
bar
and
run
the
hazard
to
lose
your
affair
sir
fond
good
lack
good
lack
i
profess
it
is
a
very
sufficient
vexation
for
a
man
to
have
a
handsome
wife
bar
never
sir
but
when
the
man
is
an
insufficient
husband
is
then
indeed
like
the
vanity
of
taking
a
fine
house
and
yet
be
forced
to
let
lodgings
to
help
pay
the
rent
fond
i
profess
a
very
apt
comparison
varlet
go
and
bid
my
cocky
come
out
to
me
i
will
give
her
some
instructions
i
will
reason
with
her
before
i
go
scene

fondlewife
and
in
the
meantime
i
will
reason
with
myself
tell
me
isaac
why
art
thee
jealous
why
art
thee
distrustful
of
the
wife
of
thy
bosom
because
she
is
young
and
vigorous
and
i
am
old
and
impotent
then
why
didst
thee
marry
isaac
because
she
was
beautiful
and
tempting
and
because
i
was
obstinate
and
doting
so
that
my
inclination
was
and
is
still
greater
than
my
power
and
will
not
that
which
tempted
thee
also
tempt
others
who
will
tempt
her
isaac
i
fear
it
much
but
does
not
thy
wife
love
thee
nay
dote
upon
thee
yes
why
then
ay
but
to
say
truth
she
fonder
of
me
than
she
has
reason
to
be
and
in
the
way
of
trade
we
still
suspect
the
smoothest
dealers
of
the
deepest
designs
and
that
she
has
some
designs
deeper
than
thou
canst
reach

so
i
remember
in

she
had
reason
if
i
wrong
her
i
begin
to
doubt

thou
so
set
this
afternoon
sir
about
an
hour
before
my

received
the
letter
sharp
in
my

it
has
a
colour
but
how
do
you
know
it
sirrah

i
do
suspect
as
much
because
why
sir
she
was
pumping
me
about
how
your
worship
affairs
stood
towards
madam
araminta
as
when
you
had
seen
her
last
when
you
were
to
see
her
next

where
you
were
to
be
found
at

such
like

and
where
did
you
tell
her
set
in
the
piazza
vain
there
i
received
the
letter
it
must
be
so
and
why
did
you
not
find

this
before

was
pimping

is
no
objection
to
the
excuse
vain
pox
of
my
saucy
credulity
if
i
have
lost
her
i
deserve
it
but
if
confession
and
repentance
be
of

i
win
her

weary
her
into

forgiveness

will
all

sure
to
be
undone
soon
as
her

so
fares
it
with

already
does

you
were

sting
that
in

pleasure
methinks
i
hear
him
in

what
will
the
world
say
where
my
reputation

no

is
out
o
fashion

loss
of
that
should
follow

many
undone

were
in

pit
why
that
some
comfort
to
an
author
fears
if
he
an
ass
he
will
be
tryed
by
peers
but
hold
i
am
exceeding
my
commission
my
business
here
was
humbly
to
petition
but
we
so
used
to
rail
on
these
occasions
i
could
not
help
one
trial
of
your
patience
for
is
our
way
you
know
for
fear
o
th
worst
to
be
beforehand
still
and
cry
fool
first
how
say
you

how
do
you
stand
affected
i
swear
young
bays
within
is
so
dejected
grieve
your
hearts
to
see

shall
i
call
him
but
then
you
cruel
critics
would
so
maul
him
yet
may
be
you
encourage
a
beginner
but
how
just
as
the
devil
does
a
sinner
women
and
wits
are
used
much
at
one
you
gain
your
end
and
damn

you
done

in

to
the
right
honourable
charles
montague
one
of
the
lords
of
the
treasury
sir
i
heartily
wish
this
play
were
as
perfect
as
i
intended
it
that
it
might
be
more
worthy
your
acceptance
and
that
my
dedication
of
it
to
you
might
be
more
becoming
that
honour
and
esteem
which
i
with
everybody
who
is
so
fortunate
as
to
know
you
have
for
you
it
had
your
countenance
when
yet
unknown
and
now
it
is
made
public
it
wants
your
protection
i
would
not
have
anybody
imagine
that
i
think
this
play
without
its
faults
for
i
am
conscious
of
several
i
confess
i
designed
whatever
vanity
or
ambition
occasioned
that
design
to
have
written
a
true
and
regular
comedy
but
i
found
it
an
undertaking
which
put
me
in
mind
of
laboret
ausus
and
now
to
make
amends
for
the
vanity
of
such
a
design
i
do
confess
both
the
attempt
and
the
imperfect
performance
yet
i
must
take
the
boldness
to
say
i
have
not
miscarried
in
the
whole
for
the
mechanical
part
of
it
is
regular
that
i
may
say
with
as
little
vanity
as
a
builder
may
say
he
has
built
a
house
according
to
the
model
laid
down
before
him
or
a
gardener
that
he
has
set
his
flowers
in
a
knot
of
such
or
such
a
figure
i
designed
the
moral
first
and
to
that
moral
i
invented
the
fable
and
do
not
know
that
i
have
borrowed
one
hint
of
it
anywhere
i
made
the
plot
as
strong
as
i
could
because
it
was
single
and
i
made
it
single
because
i
would
avoid
confusion
and
was
resolved
to
preserve
the
three
unities
of
the
drama
sir
this
discourse
is
very
impertinent
to
you
whose
judgment
much
better
can
discern
the
faults
than
i
can
excuse
them
and
whose
good
nature
like
that
of
a
lover
will
find
out
those
hidden
beauties
if
there
are
any
such
which
it
would
be
great
immodesty
for
me
to
discover
i
think
i
do
speak
improperly
when
i
call
you
a
of
poetry
for
it
is
very
well
known
she
has
been
a
very
kind
mistress
to
you
she
has
not
denied
you
the
last
favour
and
she
has
been
fruitful
to
you
in
a
most
beautiful
issue
if
i
break
off
abruptly
here
i
hope
everybody
will
understand
that
it
is
to
avoid
a
commendation
which
as
it
is
your
due
would
be
most
easy
for
me
to
pay
and
too
troublesome
for
you
to
receive
i
have
since
the
acting
of
this
play
harkened
after
the
objections
which
have
been
made
to
it
for
i
was
conscious
where
a
true
critic
might
have
put
me
upon
my
defence
i
was
prepared
for
the
attack
and
am
pretty
confident
i
could
have
vindicated
some
parts
and
excused
others
and
where
there
were
any
plain
miscarriages
i
would
most
ingenuously
have
confessed
but
i
have
not
heard
anything
said
sufficient
to
provoke
an
answer
that
which
looks
most
like
an
objection
does
not
relate
in
particular
to
this
play
but
to
all
or
most
that
ever
have
been
written
and
that
is
soliloquy
therefore
i
will
answer
it
not
only
for
my
own
sake
but
to
save
others
the
trouble
to
whom
it
may
hereafter
be
objected
i
grant
that
for
a
man
to
talk
to
himself
appears
absurd
and
unnatural
and
indeed
it
is
so
in
most
cases
but
the
circumstances
which
may
attend
the
occasion
make
great
alteration
it
oftentimes
happens
to
a
man
to
have
designs
which
require
him
to
himself
and
in
their
nature
can
not
admit
of
a
confidant
such
for
certain
is
all
villainy
and
other
less
mischievous
intentions
may
be
very
improper
to
be
communicated
to
a
second
person
in
such
a
case
therefore
the
audience
must
observe
whether
the
person
upon
the
stage
takes
any
notice
of
them
at
all
or
no
for
if
he
supposes
any
one
to
be
by
when
he
talks
to
himself
it
is
monstrous
and
ridiculous
to
the
last
degree
nay
not
only
in
this
case
but
in
any
part
of
a
play
if
there
is
expressed
any
knowledge
of
an
audience
it
is
insufferable
but
otherwise
when
a
man
in
soliloquy
reasons
with
himself
and
and
and
weighs
all
his
designs
we
ought
not
to
imagine
that
this
man
either
talks
to
us
or
to
himself
he
is
only
thinking
and
thinking
such
matter
as
were
inexcusable
folly
in
him
to
speak
but
because
we
are
concealed
spectators
of
the
plot
in
agitation
and
the
poet
finds
it
necessary
to
let
us
know
the
whole
mystery
of
his
contrivance
he
is
willing
to
inform
us
of
this
person
thoughts
and
to
that
end
is
forced
to
make
use
of
the
expedient
of
speech
no
other
better
way
being
yet
invented
for
the
communication
of
thought
another
very
wrong
objection
has
been
made
by
some
who
have
not
taken
leisure
to
distinguish
the
characters
the
hero
of
the
play
as
they
are
pleased
to
call
him
meaning
mellefont
is
a
gull
and
made
a
fool
and
cheated
is
every
man
a
gull
and
a
fool
that
is
deceived
at
that
rate
i
afraid
the
two
classes
of
men
will
be
reduced
to
one
and
the
knaves
themselves
be
at
a
loss
to
justify
their
title
but
if
an
honest
man
who
has
an
entire
confidence
in
one
whom
he
takes
to
be
his
friend
and
whom
he
has
obliged
to
be
so
and
who
to
confirm
him
in
his
opinion
in
all
appearance
and
upon
several
trials
has
been
so
if
this
man
be
deceived
by
the
treachery
of
the
other
must
he
of
necessity
commence
fool
immediately
only
because
the
other
has
proved
a
villain
ay
but
there
was
caution
given
to
mellefont
in
the
first
act
by
his
friend
careless
of
what
nature
was
that
caution
only
to
give
the
audience
some
light
into
the
character
of
maskwell
before
his
appearance
and
not
to
convince
mellefont
of
his
treachery
for
that
was
more
than
careless
was
then
able
to
do
he
never
knew
maskwell
guilty
of
any
villainy
he
was
only
a
sort
of
man
which
he
did
not
like
as
for
his
suspecting
his
familiarity
with
my
lady
touchwood
let
examine
the
answer
that
mellefont
makes
him
and
compare
it
with
the
conduct
of
maskwell
character
through
the
play
i
would
beg
again
to
look
into
the
character
of
maskwell
before
they
accuse
mellefont
of
weakness
for
being
deceived
by
him
for
upon
summing
up
the
enquiry
into
this
objection
it
may
be
found
they
have
mistaken
cunning
in
one
character
for
folly
in
another
but
there
is
one
thing
at
which
i
am
more
concerned
than
all
the
false
criticisms
that
are
made
upon
me
and
that
is
some
of
the
ladies
are
offended
i
am
heartily
sorry
for
it
for
i
declare
i
would
rather
disoblige
all
the
critics
in
the
world
than
one
of
the
fair
sex
they
are
concerned
that
i
have
represented
some
women
vicious
and
affected
how
can
i
help
it
it
is
the
business
of
a
comic
poet
to
paint
the
vices
and
follies
of
humankind
and
there
are
but
two
sexes
male
and
female
and
which
have
a
title
to
humanity
and
if
i
leave
one
half
of
them
out
the
work
will
be
imperfect
i
should
be
very
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
make
my
compliment
to
those
ladies
who
are
offended
but
they
can
no
more
expect
it
in
a
comedy
than
to
be
tickled
by
a
surgeon
when
he
letting
blood
they
who
are
virtuous
or
discreet
should
not
be
offended
for
such
characters
as
these
distinguish
and
make
their
beauties
more
shining
and
observed
and
they
who
are
of
the
other
kind
may
nevertheless
pass
for
such
by
seeming
not
to
be
displeased
or
touched
with
the
satire
of
this
thus
have
they
also
wrongfully
accused
me
of
doing
them
a
prejudice
when
i
have
in
reality
done
them
a
service
you
will
pardon
me
sir
for
the
freedom
i
take
of
making
answers
to
other
people
in
an
epistle
which
ought
wholly
to
be
sacred
to
you
but
since
i
intend
the
play
to
be
so
too
i
hope
i
may
take
the
more
liberty
of
justifying
it
where
it
is
in
the
right
i
must
now
sir
declare
to
the
world
how
kind
you
have
been
to
my
endeavours
for
in
regard
of
what
was
well
meant
you
have
excused
what
was
ill
performed
i
beg
you
would
continue
the
same
method
in
your
acceptance
of
this
dedication
i
know
no
other
way
of
making
a
return
to
that
humanity
you
shewed
in
protecting
an
infant
but
by
enrolling
it
in
your
service
now
that
it
is
of
age
and
come
into
the
world
therefore
be
pleased
to
accept
of
this
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
favour
you
have
shewn
me
and
an
earnest
of
the
real
service
and
gratitude
of
sir
your
most
obliged
humble
servant
william
congreve
to
my
dear
friend
congreve
on
his
comedy
called
the
well
then
the
promised
hour
is
come
at
last
the
present
age
of
wit
obscures
the
past
strong
were
our
sires
and
as
they
fought
they
writ
with
force
of
arms
and
dint
of
wit
theirs
was
the
giant
race
before
the
flood
and
thus
when
charles
returned
our
empire
stood
like
janus
he
the
stubborn
soil
manured
with
rules
of
husbandry
the
rankness
cured
tamed
us
to
manners
when
the
stage
was
rude
and
english
wit
with
art
indued
our
age
was
cultivated
thus
at
length
but
what
we
gained
in
skill
we
lost
in
strength
our
builders
were
with
want
of
genius
curst
the
second
temple
was
not
like
the
first
till
you
the
best
vitruvius
come
at
length
our
beauties
equal
but
excel
our
strength
firm
doric
pillars
found
your
solid
base
the
fair
corinthian
crowns
the
higher
space
thus
all
below
is

this

true
but
you
shall
judge
whether
i
have
not
reason
to
be
alarmed
none
besides
you
and
maskwell
are
acquainted
with
the
secret
of
my
aunt
touchwood
violent
passion
for
me
since
my
first
refusal
of
her
addresses
she
has
endeavoured
to
do
me
all
ill
offices
with
my
uncle
yet
has
managed
with
that
subtilty
that
to
him
they
have
borne
the
face
of
kindness
while
her
malice
like
a
dark
lanthorn
only
shone
upon
me
where
it
was
directed
still
it
gave
me
less
perplexity
to
prevent
the
success
of
her
displeasure
than
to
avoid
the
importunities
of
her
love
and
of
two
evils
i
thought
myself
favoured
in
her
aversion
but
whether
urged
by
her
despair
and
the
short
prospect
of
time
she
saw
to
accomplish
her
designs
whether
the
hopes
of
revenge
or
of
her
love
terminated
in
the
view
of
this
my
marriage
with
cynthia
i
know
not
but
this
morning
she
surprised
me
in
my
bed
care
was
there
ever
such
a
fury
is
well
nature
has
not
put
it
into
her
sex
power
to
ravish
well
bless
us
proceed
what
followed
mel
what
at
first
amazed
me
for
i
looked
to
have
seen
her
in
all
the
transports
of
a
slighted
and
revengeful
woman
but
when
i
expected
thunder
from
her
voice
and
lightning
in
her
eyes
i
saw
her
melted
into
tears
and
hushed
into
a
sigh
it
was
long
before
either
of
us
spoke
passion
had
tied
her
tongue
and
amazement
mine
in
short
the
consequence
was
thus
she
omitted
nothing
that
the
most
violent
love
could
urge
or
tender
words
express
which
when
she
saw
had
no
effect
but
still
i
pleaded
honour
and
nearness
of
blood
to
my
uncle
then
came
the
storm
i
feared
at
first
for
starting
from
my
like
a
fury
she
flew
to
my
sword
and
with
much
ado
i
prevented
her
doing
me
or
herself
a
mischief
having
disarmed
her
in
a
gust
of
passion
she
left
me
and
in
a
resolution
confirmed
by
a
thousand
curses
not
to
close
her
eyes
till
they
had
seen
my
ruin
care
exquisite
woman
but
what
the
devil
does
she
think
thou
hast
no
more
sense
than
to
get
an
heir
upon
her
body
to
disinherit
thyself
for
as
i
take
it
this
settlement
upon
you
is
with
a
proviso
that
your
uncle
have
no
children
mel
it
is
so
well
the
service
you
are
to
do
me
will
be
a
pleasure
to
yourself
i
must
get
you
to
engage
my
lady
plyant
all
this
evening
that
my
pious
aunt
may
not
work
her
to
her
interest
and
if
you
chance
to
secure
her
to
yourself
you
may
incline
her
to
mine
she
handsome
and
knows
it
is
very
silly
and
thinks
she
has
sense
and
has
an
old
fond
husband
care
i
confess
a
very
fair
foundation
for
a
lover
to
build
upon
mel
for
my
lord
froth
he
and
his
wife
will
be
sufficiently
taken
up
with
admiring
one
another
and
brisk
gallantry
as
they
call
it
observe
my
uncle
myself
and
jack
maskwell
has
promised
me
to
watch
my
aunt
narrowly
and
give
me
notice
upon
any
suspicion
as
for
sir
paul
my
wise
that
is
to
be
my
dear
cynthia
has
such
a
share
in
his
fatherly
fondness
he
would
scarce
make
her
a
moment
uneasy
to
have
her
happy
hereafter
care
so
you
have
manned
your
works
but
i
wish
you
may
not
have
the
weakest
guard
where
the
enemy
is
strongest
mel
maskwell
you
mean
prithee
why
should
you
suspect
him
care
faith
i
can
not
help
it
you
know
i
never
liked
him
i
am
a
little
superstitious
in
physiognomy
mel
he
has
obligations
of
gratitude
to
bind
him
to
me
his
dependence
upon
my
uncle
is
through
my
means
care
upon
your
aunt
you
mean
mel
my
aunt
care
i
mistaken
if
there
be
not
a
familiarity
between
them
you
do
not
suspect
notwithstanding
her
passion
for
you
mel
pooh
pooh
nothing
in
the
world
but
his
design
to
do
me
service
and
he
endeavours
to
be
well
in
her
esteem
that
he
may
be
able
to
effect
it
care
well
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
mistaken
but
your
aunt
aversion
in
her
revenge
can
not
be
any
way
so
effectually
shown
as
in
bringing
forth
a
child
to
disinherit
you
she
is
handsome
and
cunning
and
naturally
wanton
maskwell
is
flesh
and
blood
at
best
and
opportunities
between
them
are
frequent
his
affection
to
you
you
have
confessed
is
grounded
upon
his
interest
that
you
have
transplanted
and
should
it
take
root
in
my
lady
i
do
see
what
you
can
expect
from
the
fruit
mel
i
confess
the
consequence
is
visible
were
your
suspicions
just
but
see
the

is
broke
up

were
you

much
better

it

i

i
almost
tipsy

would
have
been

powerful

sure
as
can
be
it
would
we
wanted
your
company
but
brisk
where
is
he
i
swear
and
vow
he
a
most
facetious
person
and
the
best
company

my
lord
froth
your

is
so
merry
a

what
do
you

oh
barbarous
i
as
lieve
you
called
me
fool
sir
paul
nay
i
protest
and
vow
now
is
true
when
brisk
jokes
your

laugh
does
so
become
you
he
he
he
lord
froth
ridiculous
sir
paul
you
strangely

i
find

powerful
i
assure
you
sir

i
laugh
at
nobody

but
my
own
or
a
lady
i
assure
you
sir
paul
brisk
how
how
my
lord
what
affront
my
wit
let
me
perish
do
i
never
say
anything
worthy
to
be
laughed
at
lord
froth
oh
foy
do
misapprehend
me
i
do
say
so
for
i
often
smile
at
your
conceptions
but
there
is
nothing
more
unbecoming
a
man
of
quality
than
to
laugh
is
such
a
vulgar
expression
of
the
passion
everybody
can
laugh
then
especially
to
laugh
at
the
jest
of
an
inferior
person
or
when
anybody
else
of
the
same
quality
does
not
laugh
with
one
ridiculous
to
be
pleased
with
what
pleases
the
crowd
now
when
i
laugh
i
always
laugh
alone
brisk
i
suppose
that
because
you
laugh
at
your
own
jests
ha
ha
ha
lord
froth
he
he
i
swear

that
adoration

rooted
in

madam
when

through

look
you

alone
pray
contain
yourself
and
hear
me
you
know
you
loved
your
nephew
when
i
first
sighed
for
you
i
quickly
found
it
an
argument
that
i
loved
for
with
that
art
you
veiled
your
passion
was
imperceptible
to
all
but
jealous
eyes
this
discovery
made
me
bold
i
confess
it
for
by
it
i
thought
you
in
my
power
your
nephew
scorn
of
you
added
to
my
hopes
i
watched
the
occasion
and
took
you
just
repulsed
by
him

at
once
with
love
and
indignation
your
disposition
my
arguments

happy
opportunity
accomplished
my
design

pressed
the
yielding
minute
and
was
blest
how
i
have
loved
you
since
words
have
not
shown
then
how
should
words
express

touch
well
mollifying
devil
and
have
i
not
met
your
love
with
forward
fire
mask
your
zeal
i
grant
was
ardent
but
misplaced
there
was
revenge
in
view
that
woman
idol
had
defiled
the
temple
of
the
god
and
love
was
made
a
a
son
and
heir
would
have
edged
young
mellefont
upon
the
brink
of
ruin
and
left
him
none
but
you
to
catch
at
for
prevention
lady
touch
again
provoke
me
do
you
wind
me
like
a
larum
only
to
rouse
my

stilled
soul
for
your
diversion
confusion

i
gone
if
you
relapse
what

nothing
but
what
you
yourself
in
open
hours
of
love
have
told
me
why
should
you
deny
it
nay
how
can
you
is
not
all
this
present
heat
owing
to
the
same
fire
do
you
not
love
him
still
how
have
i
this
day
offended
you
but
in
not
breaking
off
his
match
with
cynthia
which
ere
shall
be
done
had
you
but
patience
lady
touch
how
what
said
you
maskwell
another
caprice
to
unwind
my
temper
mask
by
no
i
am
your
slave
the
slave
of
all
your
pleasures

will
not
rest
till

have
given
you
peace

my
soul

burn
married

immediate
ruin
seize

you
shall
possess

how
how
thou
dear
thou
precious
villain
how
mask
you
have
already
been
tampering
with
my
lady
plyant
lady
touch
i
have
she
is
ready
for
any
impression
i
think
fit
mask
she
must
be
throughly
persuaded
that
mellefont
loves
her
lady
touch
she
is
so
credulous
that
way
naturally
and
likes
him
so
well
that
she
will
believe
it
faster
than
i
can
persuade
her
but
i
do
see
what
you
can
propose
from
such
a
trifling
design
for
her
first
conversing
with
mellefont
will
convince
her
of
the
contrary
mask
i
know
it
i
do
depend
upon
it
but
it
will
prepare
something
else
and
gain
us
leisure
to
lay
a
stronger
plot
if
i
gain
a
little
time
i
shall
not
want
contrivance

is
it
possible
your

could
have
been
so
much
in
love
lady
froth
i
could
not
sleep
i
did
not
sleep
one
wink
for
three
weeks
together
cynt
prodigious
i
wonder
want
of
sleep
and
so
much
love
and
so
much
wit
as
your
ladyship
has
did
not
turn
your
brain
lady
froth
oh
my
dear
cynthia
you
must
not
rally
your
friend
but
really
as
you
say
i
wonder
too
but
then
i
had
a
way
for
between
you
and
i
i
had
whimsies
and
vapours
but
i
gave
them
vent
cynt
how
pray
madam
lady
froth
oh
i
writ
writ
abundantly
do
you
never
write
cynt
write
what
lady
froth
songs
elegies
satires
encomiums
panegyrics
lampoons
plays
or
heroic
poems
cynt
o
lord
not
i
madam
i
content
to
be
a
courteous
reader
lady
froth
oh
inconsistent
in
love
and
not
write
if
my
lord
and
i
had
been
both
of
your
temper
we
had
never
come
together
oh
bless
me
what
a
sad
thing
would
that
have
been
if
my
lord
and
i
should
never
have
met
cynt
then
neither
my
lord
nor
you
would
ever
have
met
with
your
match
on
my
conscience
lady
froth
o
my
conscience
no
more
we
should
thou
right
for
sure
my
lord
froth
is
as
fine
a
gentleman
and
as
much
a
man
of
quality
ah
nothing
at
all
of
the
common
air
i
think
i
may
say
he
wants
nothing
but
a
blue
ribbon
and
a
star
to
make
him
shine
the
very
phosphorus
of
our
hemisphere
do
you
understand
those
two
hard
words
if
you
do
i
explain
to
you
cynt
yes
yes
madam
i
not
so
at
least
i
wo
own
it
to
be
troubled
with
your
instructions
lady
froth
nay
i
beg
your
pardon
but
being
derived
from
the
greek
i
thought
you
might
have
escaped
the
etymology
but
i
the
more
amazed
to
find
you
a
woman
of
letters
and
not
write
bless
me
how
can
mellefont
believe
you
love
him
cynt
why
faith
madam
he
that
wo
take
my
word
shall
never
have
it
under
my
hand
lady
froth
i
vow
mellefont
a
pretty
gentleman
but
methinks
he
wants
a
manner
cynt
a
manner
what
that
madam
lady
froth
some
distinguishing
quality
as
for
example
the
or
of
brisk
the
solemnity
yet
complaisance
of
my
lord
or
something
of
his
own
that
should
look
a
little
he
is
too
much
a
mediocrity
in
my
mind
cynt
he
does
not
indeed
affect
either
pertness
or
formality
for
which
i
like
him
here
he
comes
lady
froth
and
my
lord
with
him
pray
observe
the
difference

mellefont
cynthia
mel
you
thoughtful
cynthia
cynt
i
thinking
though
marriage
makes
man
and
wife
one
flesh
it
leaves
still
two
fools
and
they
become
more
conspicuous
by
setting
off
one
another
mel
that
only
when
two
fools
meet
and
their
follies
are
opposed
cynt
nay
i
have
known
two
wits
meet
and
by
the
opposition
of
their
wit
render
themselves
as
ridiculous
as
fools
is
an
odd
game
going
to
play
at
what
think
you
of
drawing
stakes
and
giving
over
in
time
mel
no
that
not
endeavouring
to
win
because
it
possible
we
may
lose
since
we
have
shuffled
and
cut
let
even
turn
up
trump
now
cynt
then
i
find
it
like
cards
if
either
of
us
have
a
good
hand
it
is
an
accident
of
fortune
mel
no
marriage
is
rather
like
a
game
at
bowls
fortune
indeed
makes
the
match
and
the
two
nearest
and
sometimes
the
two
farthest
are
together
but
the
game
depends
entirely
upon
judgment
cynt
still
it
is
a
game
and
consequently
one
of
us
must
be
a
loser
mel
not
at
all
only
a
friendly
trial
of
skill
and
the
winnings
to
be
laid
out
in
an
entertainment
what
here
the
music
oh
my
lord
has
promised
the
company
a
new
song
we
get
to
give
it
us
by
the
way
crossing

pray
let
us
have
the
favour
of
you
to
practise
the
song

company
hear
it
song

i
woo
her

she
vext
if
i
give
over
much
she
fears
i
should
undo
her

much
more
to
lose
her

in

she
refuses

not
winning
thus
she
loses

yonder
is
the
violator
of

violation
was
intended

does
not
care

thy
portion

have
tantalised

broke

have
been
long
secretly
in

with
cynthia

did
my

convinced
your

i
might
be
trusted

it
was
as
much
my
interest
as
hers
to
break
the

she
thought
my
jealousy

qualify
me
to
assist
her
in
her
revenge
and
in
short
in
that
belief
told
me
the
secrets
of
her
heart
at
length
we
made
this
agreement
if
i
accomplish
her
designs

i
told
you
before
she
has
engaged
to
put
cynthia
with
all
her
fortune
into
my
power

she
is
most
gracious
in
her
favour
well
and
dear
jack
how
hast
thou
contrived
mask
i
would
not
have
you
stay
to
hear
it
now
for
i
do
know
but
she
may
come
this
way
i
am
to
meet
her
anon
after
that
i
tell
you
the
whole
matter

here
in
this
gallery
an
hour
hence
by
that

i
imagine
our
consultation
may
be
over

attend
thee

till
then
success
will
attend
me
for
when
i
meet
you
i
meet
the
only
obstacle
to
my
fortune
cynthia
let
thy
beauty
gild
my
crimes
and
whatsoever
i
commit
of
treachery
or
deceit
shall
be
imputed
to
me
as
a
merit
treachery
what
treachery
love
cancels
all
the
bonds
of
friendship
and
sets
men
right
upon
their
first
foundations
duty
to
kings
piety
to
parents
gratitude
to
benefactors
and
fidelity
to
friends
are
different
and
particular
ties
but
the
name
of
rival
cuts
all
asunder
and
is
a
general
acquittance
rival
is
equal
and
love
like
death
an
universal
leveller
of
mankind
ha
but
is
there
not
such
a
thing
as
honesty
yes
and
whosoever
has
it
about
him
bears
an
enemy
in
his
breast
for
your
honest
man
as
i
take
it
is
that
nice
scrupulous
conscientious
person
who
will
cheat
nobody
but
himself
such
another
coxcomb
as
your
wise
man
who
is
too
hard
for
all
the
world
and
will
be
made
a
fool
of
by
nobody
but
himself
ha
ha
ha
well
for
wisdom
and
honesty
give
me
cunning
and
hypocrisy
oh
is
such
a
pleasure
to
angle
for
fools
then
that
hungry
gudgeon
credulity
will
bite
at
anything
why
let
me
see
i
have
the
same
face
the
same
words
and
accents
when
i
speak
what
i
do
think
and
when
i
speak
what
i
do
not
think
the
very
same
and
dear
dissimulation
is
the
only
art
not
to
be
known
from
nature
why
will
mankind
be
fools
and
be
deceived
and
why
are
friends
and
lovers
oaths
believed
when
each
who
searches
strictly
his
own
mind
may
so
much
fraud
and
power
of
baseness
find

my

can
you
blame

my
lady

a
large
eye
and
would
centre
everything
in
her
own
circle
is
not
the
first
time
she
has
mistaken
respect
for

and
made
sir

jealous
of
the
civility
of
an
undesigning

the
better
to
bespeak
his

in

unfeigned

you
censure
hardly
my
lord
my
sister
honour
is
very
well
known
lord
touch
yes
i
believe
i
know
some
that

been
familiarly
acquainted
with

this
is
a
little
trick
wrought
by
some
pitiful
contriver
envious
of
my
nephew
merit
lady
touch
nay
my
lord
it
may
be
so
and
i
hope
it
will
be
found
so
but
that
will
require
some
time
for
in
such
a
case
as
this
demonstration
is
necessary
lord
touch
there
should
have
been
demonstration
of
the
contrary
too
before
it
had
been
believed
lady
touch
so
i
suppose
there
was
lord
touch
how
where
when
lady
touch
that
i
ca
tell
nay
i
do
say
there
was
i
am
willing
to
believe
as
favourably
of
my
nephew
as
i
can
lord

i
do
know
that
lady
touch
how
do
you
believe
that

you

lord
lord
touch
no
i
do
say
so
i
confess
i
am
troubled
to
find
you
so
cold
in
his
defence
lady
touch
his
defence
bless
me
would
you
have
me
defend
an
ill
thing
lord
touch
you
believe
it
then
lady
touch
i
do
know
i
am
very
unwilling
to
speak
my
thoughts
in
anything
that
may
be
to
my
cousin
disadvantage
besides
i
find
my
lord
you
are
prepared
to
receive
an
ill
impression
from
any
opinion
of
mine
which
is
not
consenting
with
your
own
but
since
i
am
like
to
be
suspected
in
the
end
and
is
a
pain
any
longer
to
dissemble
i
own
it
to
you
in
short
i
do
believe
it
nay
and
can
believe
anything
worse
if
it
were
laid
to
his
charge
do
ask
me
my
reasons
my
lord
for
they
are
not
fit
to
be
told
you
lord
touch
i
amazed
there
must
be
something
more
than
ordinary
in
this
not
fit
to
be
told
me
madam
you
can
have
no
interests
wherein
i
am
not
concerned
and
consequently
the
same
reasons
ought
to
be
convincing
to
me
which
create
your
satisfaction
or
disquiet
lady
touch
but
those
which
cause
my
disquiet
i
am
willing
to
have
remote
from
your
hearing
good
my
lord
do
press
me
lord
touch
do
oblige
me
to
press
you
lady
touch
whatever
it
was
is
past
and
that
is
better
to
be
unknown
which
can
not
be
prevented
therefore

me
beg
you
to
rest
satisfied
lord

more
to
make

lay
my
heart
before
you

thus
transported

is
not

sometimes
with
a
little
gallantry
towards

think
he
meant
anything
seriously
but
methought
it
looked
oddly
lord
touch
confusion
and
hell
what
do
i
hear
lady
touch
or
may
be
he
thought
he
was
not
enough
akin
to
me
upon
your

and
had
a
mind
to
create
a
nearer
relation
on
his
own
a
lover
you
know
my

ha
ha
well
but
that
all
now

it
to
him

these
two
days
lord

these
two
days

it
so
fresh
unnatural
villain

i
have
him
stripped

perish
incestuous
brute

i
told
you
you
would
not
be
satisfied
when

will
be
satisfied
ungrateful
monster
how
long
lady
touch

had
grown
together
when
i
told

a
twelvemonth

more
till

my
lord
do

the
company
see
you
in
this
disorder
yet
i
confess
i
ca
blame
you
for
i
think
i
was
never
so
surprised
in
my
life
who
would
have
thought
my
nephew
could
have
so
misconstrued
my
kindness
but
will
you
go
into
your
closet
and
recover
your
temper
i
make
an
excuse
of
sudden
business
to
the
company
and
come
to
you
pray
good
dear
my
lord
let
me
beg
you
do
now

well
but

of

scene

lady
touchwood
maskwell
mask
this
was
a
masterpiece
and
did
not
need
my
help
though
i
stood
ready
for
a
cue
to
come
in
and
confirm
all
had
there
been
occasion
lady
touch
have
you
seen
mellefont
mask
i
have
and
am
to
meet
him
here
about
this
time
lady
touch
how
does
he
bear
his
disappointment
mask
secure
in
my
assistance
he
seemed
not
much
afflicted
but
rather
laughed
at
the
shallow
artifice
which
so
little
time
must
of
necessity
discover
yet
he
is
apprehensive
of
some
farther
design
of
yours
and
has
engaged
me
to
watch
you
i
believe
he
will
hardly
be
able
to
prevent
your
plot
yet
i
would
have
you
use
caution
and
expedition
lady
touch
expedition
indeed
for
all
we
do
must
be
performed
in
the
remaining
part
of
this
evening
and
before
the
company
break
up
lest
my
lord
should
cool
and
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
with
him
privately
my
lord
must
not
see
him
again
mask
by
no
means
therefore
you
must
aggravate
my
lord
displeasure
to
a
degree
that
will
admit
of
no
conference
with
him
what
think
you
of
mentioning
me
lady
touch
how
mask
to
my
lord
as
having
been
privy
to
mellefont
design
upon
you
but
still
using
my
utmost
endeavours
to
dissuade
him
though
my
friendship
and
love
to
him
has
made
me
conceal
it
yet
you
may
say
i
threatened
the
next
time
he
attempted
anything
of
that
kind
to
discover
it
to
my
lord
lady
touch
to
what
end
is
this
mask
it
will
confirm
my
lord
opinion
of
my
honour
and
honesty
and
create
in
him
a
new
confidence
in
me
which
should
this
design
miscarry
will
be
necessary
to
the
forming
another
plot
that
i
have
in
my
to
cheat
you
as
well
as
the
rest
lady
touch
i
do
it
i
tell
him
you
hindered
him
once
from
forcing
me
mask
excellent
your
ladyship
has
a
most
improving
fancy
you
had
best
go
to
my
lord
keep
him
as
long
as
you
can
in
his
closet
and
i
doubt
not
but
you
will
mould
him
to
what
you
please
your
guests
are
so
engaged
in
their
own
follies
and
intrigues
they
miss
neither
of
you

when
shall
we
meet
at
eight
this
evening

i
have

was
my
pleasure

become
my
duty

she
smoke
my
design
upon
cynthia
i
were
in
a
fine
pickle
she
has
a
damned
penetrating
head
and
knows
how
to
interpret
a
coldness
the
right
way
therefore
i
must
dissemble
ardour
and
ecstasy

resolved
how
easily
and
pleasantly
is
that
dissembled
before

purpose
mel
why
what
the
matter
she
convinced
that
i
do
care
for
her
care
i
ca
get
an
answer
from
her
that
does
not
begin
with
her
honour
or
her
virtue
her
religion
or
some
such
cant
then
she
has
told
me
the
whole
history
of
sir
paul
nine
years
courtship
how
he
has
lain
for
whole
nights
together
upon
the
stairs
before
her
and
that
the
first
favour
he
received
from
her
was
a
piece
of
an
old
scarlet
petticoat
for
a
stomacher
which
since
the
day
of
his
marriage
he
has
out
of
a
piece
of
gallantry
converted
into
a
and
wears
it
still
with
much
solemnity
on
his
anniversary
mel
that
i
have
seen
with
the
ceremony
thereunto
belonging
for
on
that
night
he
creeps
in
at
the
bed
feet
like
a
gulled
bassa
that
has
married
a
relation
of
the
grand
signior
and
that
night
he
has
his
arms
at
liberty
did
not
she
tell
you
at
what
a
distance
she
keeps
him
he
has
confessed
to
me
that
but
at
some
certain
times
that
is
i
suppose
when
she
apprehends
being
with
child
he
never
has
the
privilege
of
using
the
familiarity
of
a
husband
with
a
wife
he
was
once
given
to
scrambling
with
his
hands
and
sprawling
in
his
sleep
and
ever
since
she
has
him
swaddled
up
in
blankets
and
his
hands
and
feet
swathed
down
and
so
put
to
bed
and
there
he
lies
with
a
great
beard
like
a
russian
bear
upon
a
drift
of
snow
you
are
very
great
with
him
i
wonder
he
never
told
you
his
grievances
he
will
i
warrant
you
care
excessively
foolish
but
that
which
gives
me
most
hopes
of
her
is
her
telling
me
of
the
many
temptations
she
has
resisted
mel
nay
then
you
have
her
for
a
woman
bragging
to
a
man
that
she
has
overcome
temptations
is
an
argument
that
they
were
weakly
offered
and
a
challenge
to
him
to
engage
her
more
irresistibly
is
only
an
enhancing
the
price
of
the
commodity
by
telling
you
how
many
customers
have
underbid
her
care
nay
i
do
despair
but
still
she
has
a
grudging
to
you
i
talked
to
her
night
at
my
lord
froth
masquerade
when
satisfied
she
knew
me
and
i
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
my
reception
but
i
find
women
are
not
the
same
and
in
masks
and
a
vizor
disguises
their
inclinations
as
much
as
their
faces
mel
is
a
mistake
for
women
may
most
properly
be
said
to
be
unmasked
when
they
wear
vizors
for
that
secures
them
from
blushing
and
being
out
of
countenance
and
next
to
being
in
the
dark
or
alone
they
are
most
truly
themselves
in
a
vizor
mask
here
they
come
i
leave
you
ply
her
close
and
by
and
by
clap
a
into
her
hand
for
a
woman
never
thinks
a
man
truly
in
love
with
her
till
he
has
been
fool
enough
to
think
of
her
out
of
her
sight
and
to
lose
so
much
time
as
to
write
to
her
scene
vi
careless
sir
paul
lady
plyant
sir
paul
sha
we
disturb
your
meditation
careless
you
would
be
private

be
always
welcome

my
privacy
sir
paul
o
sweet
sir
you
load
your
humble
servants
both
me
and
my
wife
with
continual
favours
lady
plyant
sir
paul
what
a
phrase
was
there
you
will
be
making
answers
and
taking
that
upon
you
which
ought
to
lie
upon
me
that
you
should
have
so
little
breeding
to
think
careless
did
not
apply
himself
to
me
pray
what
have
you
to
entertain
anybody
privacy
i
swear
and
declare
in
the
face
of
the
world
i
ready
to
blush
for
your
ignorance
sir
paul
i
acquiesce
my
lady
but
do
snub
so
loud
to
lady
plyant
careless
if
a
person
that
is
wholly
illiterate
might
be
supposed
to
be
capable
of
being
qualified
to
make
a
suitable
return
to
those
obligations
which
you
are
pleased
to
confer
upon
one
that
is
wholly
incapable
of
being
qualified
in
all
those
circumstances
i
sure
i
should
rather
attempt
it
than
anything
in
the
world
for
i
sure
there
nothing
in
the
world
that
i
would
rather
but
i
know
careless
is
so
great
a
critic
and
so
fine
a
gentleman
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
care
o

confound
me

have
not
those
advantages

know
my
imperfections
but
at
the
same
time
you
must
give
me
leave
to
declare
in
the
face
of
the
world
that
nobody
is
more
sensible
of
favours
and
things
for
with
the
reserve
of
my
honour
i
assure
you
careless
i
do
know
anything
in
the
world
i
would
refuse
to
a
person
so
meritorious
you
pardon
my
want
of
expression

all
excellence

as
i
was
telling

very
near
care
what

be
sir
paul
sir

a
very
plentiful
fortune
a
good
estate
in
the
country
some
houses
in
town
and
some
money
a
pretty
tolerable
personal
estate
and
it
is
a
great
grief
to
me
indeed
it
is
careless
that
i
have
not
a
son
to
inherit
this
is
true
i
have
a
daughter
and
a
fine
dutiful
child
she

that
my
affliction
and
my
only
affliction

might
be
easily
remedied

lady
a
fine
likely
woman
sir
paul
oh
a
fine
likely
woman
as

shall
tell
you
my
lady
is
so
nice
it
very
strange
but
it

nice

would
touch
a
man
for
the
world
at
least
not
above
once
a
year
i
sure
i
have
found
it
so
and
alas
what
once
a
year
to
an
old
man
who
would
do
good
in
his
generation
indeed
true
careless
it
breaks
my
heart
i
am
her
husband
as
i
may
say
though
far
unworthy
of
that
honour
yet
i
am
her
husband
but
i
have
no
more
familiarity
with
her
person
as
to
that
matter
than
with
my
own
mother
no
indeed

this
is
a
lamentable
story
my
lady
must
be
told

mightily
in
her
favour

i
warrant
you
what
we
must
have
a
son
some
way
or
other
sir
paul

i
should
be
mightily
bound
to
you
if

bring
it
about

how
does
my

come
hither
to
thy

poor
lamb
melancholic
lord
froth
heaven
sir
paul
you
amaze
me
of
all
things
in
the
world
you
are
never
pleased
but
when
we
are
all
upon
the
broad
grin
all
laugh
and
no
company
ah
then
is
such
a
sight
to
see
some
teeth
sure
you
a
great
admirer
of
my
lady
whifler
mr
sneer
and
sir
laurence
loud
and
that
gang
sir
paul
i
vow
and
swear
she
a
very
merry
woman
but
i
think
she
laughs
a
little
too
much
lord
froth
merry
o
lord
what
a
character
that
is
of
a
woman
of
quality
you
have
been
at
my
lady
whifler
upon
her
day
madam
cynt
yes
my
lord
i
must
humour
this
fool
lord
froth
well
and
how
hee
what
is
your
sense
of
the
conversation
cynt
oh
most
ridiculous
a
perpetual
comfort
of
laughing
without
any
harmony
for
sure
my
lord
to
laugh
out
of
time
is
as
disagreeable
as
to
sing
out
of
time
or
out
of
tune
lord
froth
hee
hee
hee
right
and
then
my
lady
whifler
is
so
ready
she
always
comes
in
three
bars
too
soon
and
then
what
do
they
laugh
at
for
you
know
laughing
without
a
jest
is
as
impertinent
hee
as
as
cynt
as
dancing
without
a
fiddle
lord
froth
just
that
was
at
my
tongue
end
cynt
but
that
can
not
be
properly
said
of
them
for
i
think
they
are
all
in
good
nature
with
the
world
and
only
laugh
at
one
another
and
you
must
allow
they
have
all
jests
in
their
persons
though
they
have
none
in
their
conversation
lord
froth
true
as
i
a
person
of
honour
for
heaven
sake
let
us
sacrifice
to
mirth
a
little
boy
sir
paul
sir
paul
gads
wife
wife
my
lady
plyant
i
have
a
word
lady
plyant
i
busy
sir
paul
i
wonder
at
your
impertinence
care
sir
paul
harkee
i
reasoning
the
matter
you
know
madam
if
your
ladyship
please
we
discourse
of
this
in
the
next
room
sir

o
ho
i
wish
you
good
success
i
wish
you
good
success
boy
tell
my
lady
when
she
has
done
i
would
speak
with
her
below
scene
cynthia
lord
froth
lady
froth
brisk
lady
froth
then
you
think
that
episode
between
susan
the
and
our
coachman
is
not
amiss
you
know
i
may
suppose
the
dairy
in
town
as
well
as
in
the
country
brisk
incomparable
let
me
perish
but
then
being
an
heroic
poem
had
you
not
better
call
him
a
charioteer
charioteer
sounds
great
besides
your
ladyship
coachman
having
a
red
face
and
you
comparing
him
to
the
sun
and
you
know
the
sun
is
called
heaven
charioteer
lady
froth
oh
infinitely
better
i
extremely
beholden
to
you
for
the
hint
stay
we
read
over
those
half
a
score
lines
again
out
a
let
me
see
here
you
know
what
goes
before
the
comparison
you
know
for
as
the
sun
shines
day
so
of
our
coachman
i
may
say
brisk
i
afraid
that
simile
wo
do
in
wet
weather
because
you
say
the
sun
shines
every
day
lady
froth
no
for
the
sun
it
wo
but
it
will
do
for
the
coachman
for
you
know
there
most
occasion
for
a
coach
in
wet
weather
brisk
right
right
that
saves
all
lady
froth
then
i
do
say
the
sun
shines
all
the
day
but
that
he
peeps
now
and
then
yet
he
does
shine
all
the
day
too
you
know
though
we
do
see
him
brisk
right
but
the
vulgar
will
never
comprehend
that
lady
froth
well
you
shall
hear
let
me
see
for
as
the
sun
shines
day
so
of
our
coachman
i
may
say
he
shows
his
drunken
fiery
face
just
as
the
sun
does
more
or
less
brisk
that
right
all
well
all
well
or
less
lady
froth
reads
and
when
at
night
his
labour
done
then
too
like
charioteer
the
sun
ay
charioteer
does
better
into
the
dairy
he
descends
and
there
his
whipping
and
his
driving
ends
there
he
secure
from
danger
of
a
bilk
his
fare
is
paid
him
and
he
sets
in
milk
for
susan
you
know
is
thetis
and
so
brisk
incomparable
well
and
proper
egad
but
i
have
one
exception
to
make
do
you
think
bilk
i
know
it
good
rhyme
but
do
you
think
and
too
like
a
hackney
coachman
lady
froth
i
swear
and
vow
i
afraid
so
and
yet
our
jehu
was
a
hackney
coachman
when
my
lord
took
him
brisk
was
he
i
answered
if
jehu
was
a
hackney
coachman
you
may
put
that
in
the
marginal
notes
though
to
prevent
criticism
only
mark
it
with
a
small
asterism
and
say
was
formerly
a
hackney
coachman
lady
froth
i
will
you
oblige
me
extremely
to
write
notes
to
the
whole
poem
brisk
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
proud
of
the
vast
honour
let
me
perish
lord
froth
hee
hee

days
together
in
going
about

garden
to
suit
the
lining
of
his
coach
with
his
complexion
lord
froth
o
silly
yet
his
aunt
is
as
fond
of
him
as
if
she
had
brought
the
ape
into
the
world
herself
brisk
who

mortifying
spectacle

her
gums
bare
and
her
mouth
open

hard
to
counterfeit
joy
in
the

as
to
dissemble

of

why

why

cynt
i
heard
him
loud
as
i
came
by
the
and
my
lady
with
him
but
she
seemed
to
moderate
his
passion
mel
ay
hell
thank
her
as
gentle
breezes
moderate
a
fire
but
i
shall
her
spells
and
ride
the

cynt
it

she
cast
beyond
you
still
i
lay
my

it
will
never
be
a
match
mel
what
cynt
between
you
and
me
mel
why
so
cynt
my
mind
gives
me
it
wo
because
we
are
both
willing
we
each
of
us
strive
to
reach
the
goal
and
hinder
one
another
in
the
race
i
swear
it
never
does
well
when
the
parties
are
so
agreed
for
when
people
walk
hand
in
hand
there
neither
overtaking
nor
meeting
we
hunt
in
couples
where
we
both
pursue
the
same
game
but
forget
one
another
and
because
we
are
so
near
that
we
do
think
of
coming
together
mel
hum
i
believe
there
something
in
it
marriage
is
the
game
that
we
hunt
and
while
we
think
that
we
only
have
it
in
view
i
see
but
we
have
it
in
our
power
cynt
within
reach
for
example
give
me
your
hand
you
have
looked
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
perspective
all
this
while
for
nothing
has
been
between
us
but
our
fears
mel
i
do
know
why
we
should
not
steal
out
of
the
house
this
very
moment
and
marry
one
another
without
consideration
or
the
fear
of
repentance
pox
o
fortune
portion
settlements
and
jointures
cynt
ay
ay
what
have
we
to
do
with
you
know
we
marry
for
love
mel
love
love
downright
very
villainous
love
cynt
and
he
that
ca
live
upon
love
deserves
to
die
in
a
ditch
here
then
i
give
you
my
promise
in
spite
of
duty
any
temptation
of
wealth
your
inconstancy
or
my
own
inclination
to
change
mel
to
run
most
wilfully
and
unreasonably
away
with
me
this
moment
and
be
married
cynt
hold
never
to
marry
anybody
else
mel
that
but
a
kind
of
negative
consent
why
you
wo
baulk
the
frolic
cynt
if
you
had
not
been
so
assured
of
your
own
conduct
i
would
not
but
is
but
reasonable
that
since
i
consent
to
like
a
man
without
the
vile
consideration
of
money
he
should
give
me
a
very
evident
demonstration
of
his
wit
therefore
let
me
see
you
undermine
my
lady
touchwood
as
you
boasted
and
force
her
to
give
her
consent
and
then
mel
i
cynt
and
i
mel
this
very
next
ensuing
hour
of
eight
is
the
last
minute
of
her
reign
unless

if
the

should
assist
her
and
your
plot
miscarry
mel
ay
what

i
to

to
then
cynt
why
if
you
give
me
very
clear
demonstration
that
it

the
devil
i

for
irresistible
odds

if
i
find
it
to
be

chance

or
unlucky

anything

the
very
devil
inexorable

still
i
keep
my
word
and
live
a

for

and
you
wo
die

so
moving

i
must
do
you
this
justice

anybody
gained
so
far
upon
me
as
yourself
with
blushes
i
must
own
it
you
have
shaken
as
i
may
say
the
very
foundation
of
my
honour
well
sure
if
i
escape
your
importunities
i
shall
value
myself
as
long
as
i
live
i

and
despise
me
lady
plyant
the
last
of
any
man
in

my
purity
now
you
make
me

o
gratitude

should
ever
be
wanting
in
a
respectful
acknowledgment
of
an
entire
resignation
of
all
my
best
wishes
for
the
person
and
parts
of
so
accomplished

whose
merit
challenges
much
more

my
illiterate
praises

whining
ah
heavens

me
with
kindness

to
my
heart

trembling
heart

instruct
your
pulse
and
teach
it
to
alarm

almost
at
the
end
of
my
cant

not
yield
quickly
lady
plyant

that
so
passionate
and
fine
i
can
not
hear
i
am
not
safe
if
i
stay
and
must
leave
you

and
must
you
leave
me
rather
let
me
languish
out
a
wretched
life
and
breath
my
soul
beneath
your
feet
i
must
say
the
same
thing
over
again
and
ca
help

swear
i
ready
to
languish
too
o
my
honour
whither
is
it
going
i
protest
you
have
given
me
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
care
can
you
be
so
cruel
lady
plyant
o
rise
i
beseech
you
say
no
more
till
you
rise
why
did
you
kneel
so
long
i
swear
i
was
so
transported
i
did
not
see
it
well
to
show
you
how
far
you
have
gained
upon
me
i
assure
you
if
sir
paul
should
die
of
all
mankind
there
none
i
sooner
make
my
second
choice
care
o
heaven
i
ca
this
night
without
your
favour
i
feel
my
spirits
faint
a
general
dampness
overspreads
my
face
a
cold
deadly
dew
already
vents
through
all
my
pores
and
will
wash
me
for
ever
from
your
sight
and
drown
me
in
my
tomb
lady
plyant
oh
you
have
conquered
sweet
melting
moving
sir
you
have
conquered
what
heart
of
marble
can
refrain
to
weep
and
yield
to
such
sad
sayings
care
i
thank
heaven
they
are
the
saddest
that
i
ever
said
oh
i
shall
never
contain
laughter
lady
plyant
oh
i
yield
myself
all
up
to
your
uncontrollable
embraces
say
thou
dear
dying
man
when
where
and
how
ah
there
sir
paul
care
yonder
sir
paul
but
if
he
were
not
come
i
so
transported
i
can
not
speak
this
note
will
inform
you
her
a
scene
iii
lady
plyant
sir
paul
cynthia
sir
paul
thou
art
my
tender
lambkin
and
shalt
do
what
thou
wilt
but
endeavour
to
forget
this
mellefont
cynt
i
would
obey
you
to
my
power
sir
but
if
i
have
not
him
i
have
sworn
never
to
marry
sir
paul
never
to
marry
heavens
forbid
must
i
neither
have
sons
nor
grandsons
must
the
family
of
the
plyants
be
utterly
extinct
for
want
of
issue
male
o
impiety
but
did
you
swear
did
that
sweet
creature
swear
ha
how
durst
you
swear
without
my
consent
ah
who
am
i
cynt
pray
do
be
angry
sir
when
i
swore
i
had
your
consent
and
therefore
i
swore
sir
paul
why
then
the
revoking
my
consent
does
annul
or
make
of
none
effect
your
oath
so
you
may
unswear
it
again
the
law
will
allow
it
cynt
ay
but
my
conscience
never
will
sir
paul
no
matter
for
that
conscience
and
law
never
go
together
you
must
not
expect
that
lady
plyant
ay
but
sir
paul
i
conceive
if
she
has
sworn
d
mark
me
if
she
has
once
sworn
it
is
most
unchristian
inhuman
and
obscene
that
she
should
break
it
i
make
up
the
match
again
because
careless
said
it
would
oblige
him
sir
paul
does
your
ladyship
conceive
so
why
i
was
of
that
opinion
once
too
nay
if
your
ladyship
conceives
so
i
of
that
opinion
again
but
i
can
neither
find
my
lord
nor
my
lady
to
know
what
they
intend
lady
plyant
i
satisfied
that
my
cousin
mellefont
has
been
much
wronged
cynt
i
amazed
to
find
her
of
our
side
for
i
sure
she
loved
him
lady
plyant
i
know
my
lady
touchwood
has
no
kindness
for
him
and
besides
i
have
been
informed
by
careless
that
mellefont
had
never
anything
more
than
a
profound
respect
that
he
has
owned
himself
to
be
my
admirer
is
true
but
he
was
never
so
presumptuous
to
entertain
any
dishonourable
notions
of
things
so
that
if
this
be
made
plain
i
see
how
my
daughter
can
in
conscience
or
honour
or
anything
in
the
world
sir
paul
indeed
if
this
be
made
plain
as
my
lady
your
mother
says
child
lady
plyant
plain
i
was
informed
of
it
by
careless
and
i
assure
you
careless
is
a
person
that
has
a
most
extraordinary
respect
and
honour
for
you
sir
paul
cynt
and
for
your
ladyship
too
i
believe
or
else
you
had
not
changed
sides
so
soon
now
i
begin
to
find
it
sir
paul
i
am
much
obliged
to
careless
really
he
is
a
person
that
i
have
a
great
value
for
not
only
for
that
but
because
he
has
a
great
veneration
for
your
ladyship
lady
plyant
o
las
no
indeed
sir
paul
is
upon
your
account
sir
paul
no
i
protest
and
vow
i
have
no
title
to
his
esteem
but
in
having
the
honour
to
appertain
in
some
measure
to
your
ladyship
all
lady
plyant
o
law
now
i
swear
and
declare
it
sha
be
so
you
too
modest
sir
paul
sir
paul
it
becomes
me
when
there
is
any
comparison
made
between
lady
plyant
o
fie
fie
sir
paul
you
put
me
out
of
countenance
your
very
obedient
and
affectionate
wife
that
all
and
highly
honoured
in
that
title
sir
paul
i
am
transported
give
me
leave
to
kiss
your
ladyship
hand
cynt
that
my
poor
father
should
be
so
very
silly
lady
plyant

lip

paul

swear

shall
kisses
bows

sir
paul

humbly
thank
your
ladyship

do
know
whether
i
fly
on
ground
or
walk
in
air
she
was
never
thus
before
well
i
must
own
myself
the
most
beholden
to
careless
as
sure
as
can
be
this
is
all
his
doing
something
that
he
has
said
well
is
a
rare
thing
to
have
an
ingenious
friend
well
your
ladyship
is
of
opinion
that
the
match
may
go
forward
lady
plyant
by
all
means
careless
has
satisfied
me
of
the
matter
sir
paul
well
why
then
lamb
you
may
keep
your
oath
but
have
a
care
about
making
rash
vows
come
hither
to
me
and
kiss
papa
lady
plyant
i
swear
and
declare
i
am
in
such
a
twitter
to
read
careless
his
letter
that
i
ca
forbear
any
longer
but
though
i
may
read
all
letters
first
by
prerogative
yet
i
be
sure
to
be
unsuspected
this
time

your
ladyship

deprived

i
approached

bed
with
reverence
as
to
a
sacred
shrine
and
denied
myself
the
enjoyment
of
lawful
domestic
pleasures
to
preserve
its
purity

must
i
now
find
it
polluted
by
foreign
iniquity

were
chaste
as

you
are
melted
now

false

tried
all
arguments

informed
your

i
knew

thank
you
what
is
the
villain

mask
he
has
owned
nothing
to
me
of

and
what
i
mean
now
is
only
a
bare
suspicion
of
my
own
if
your
lordship
will
meet
me
a
quarter
of
an

hence
there
in

i
do
know
whether
i
have

i
find

i
have
once

a
true

to
oppose
anything

that
which

me
upon

was
the
finding
it
impossible
to
gain

in
the
hopes
of
her
marrying
you

so
while

my

all

been
to
gratify

cheat

prove
a
faithful

wait

have
put
the
change
upon

she
may
be

where
employed
do
you
procure
her
and
with
your
hoods
tied
over
your

meet
him
in
her
stead
you
may
go
privately
by
the
back
stairs
and
unperceived
there
you
may
propose
to
reinstate
him
in
his
uncle
favour
if
comply
with
your
desires
his
case
is
desperate

i
believe
yield
to
any
conditions
if
not
here
take
this
you
may
employ
it
better
than
in

let
secret

be
warned
in
private
mischiefs

torture
and
shame
attend
their
open
birth
like
vipers
in

treachery

epilogue
spoken
by
mountford
could
poets
but
foresee
how
plays
would
take
then
they
could
tell
what
epilogues
to
make
whether
to
thank
or
blame
their
audience
most
but
that
late
knowledge
does
much
hazard
cost
till
dice
are
thrown
there
nothing
won
nor
lost
so
till
the
thief
has
stolen
he
can
not
know
whether
he
shall
escape
the
law
or
no
but
poets
run
much
greater
hazards
far
than
they
who
stand
their
trials
at
the
bar
the
law
provides
a
curb
for
it
own
fury
and
suffers
judges
to
direct
the
jury
but
in
this
court
what
difference
does
appear
for
every
one
both
judge
and
jury
here
nay
and
what
worse
an
executioner
all
have
a
right
and
title
to
some
part
each
choosing
that
in
which
he
has
most
art
the
dreadful
men
of
learning
all
confound
unless
the
fable
good
and
moral
sound
the
that
are
in
pit
and
gallery
approve
or
damn
the
repartee
and
raillery
the
lady
critics
who
are
better
read
inquire
if
characters
are
nicely
bred
if
the
soft
things
are
penned
and
spoke
with
grace
they
judge
of
action
too
and
time
and
place
in
which
we
do
not
doubt
but
they
discerning
for
that
a
kind
of
assignation
learning
beaus
judge
of
dress
the
witlings
judge
of
songs
the
cuckoldom
of
ancient
right
to
cits
belongs
thus
poor
poets
the
favour
are
denied
even
to
make
exceptions
when
they
tried
is
hard
that
they
must
every
one
admit
methinks
i
see
some
faces
in
the
pit
which
must
of
consequence
be
foes
to
wit
you
who
can
judge
to
sentence
may
proceed
but
though
he
can
not
write
let
him
be
freed
at
least
from
their
contempt
who
can
not
read
