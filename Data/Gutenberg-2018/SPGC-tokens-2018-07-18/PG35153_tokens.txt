the

to
alfred
turner
is
a
book
my
dear
turner
which
i
had
in
my
heart
to
write
for
many
years
the
thought
of
it
came
to
me
with
that
other
thought
that
i
was
growing
rather
grown
old
that
the
curtain
had
definitely
been
rung
down
on
all
the
days
of
my
youth
and
so
i
got
into
the
way
of
looking
back
of
recalling
the
far
gone
times
and
suns
of
the
and
early
when
the
scene
of
my
life
was
being
set
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
write
about
it
all
some
day
would
undoubtedly
have
been
never
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
i
had
not
spoken
of
the
projected
book
to
you
or
anyone
else
but
one
fine
morning
in
you
ordered
me
to
write
it
you
were
then
you
will
remember
editing
the
london
evening
news
and
as
a
reporter
on
your
staff
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
the
book
was
written
appeared
in
the
paper
as
the
confessions
of
a
literary
man
and
now
reappears
as
far
off
things
far
good
i
enjoyed
writing
the
book
enormously
and
i
frankly
confess
i
enjoy
reading
it
in
a
word
i
am
not
grumbling
but
there
is
one
little
point
that
i
do
not
mean
to
neglect
my
complacent
views
as
to
far
off
things
may
not
be
shared
by
other
and
possibly
more
competent
judges
and
what
i
want
to
impress
on
you
is
this
that
if
there
is
to
be
trouble
you
are
going
to
have
your
share
of
it
you
ordered
the
book
to
be
written
you
printed
it
in
your
paper
you
have
urged
me
to
reprint
it
not
once
or
twice
but
again
and
you
remember
johnson
on
advising
an
author
to
print
his
book
this
author
said
the
doctor
when
mankind
are
hunting
him
with
a
canister
at
his
tail
can
say
would
not
have
published
had
not
johnson
or
reynolds
or
musgrave
or
some
other
good
judge
commended
the
work
you
see
the
purpose
of
this
epistle
dedicatory
it
is
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
if
there
is
to
be
any
talk
of
canisters
and
tails
the
order
will
run
canisters
for
two
arthur
machen
one
night
a
year
or
so
ago
i
was
the
guest
of
a
famous
literary
society
this
society
or
club
it
is
well
known
believes
in
celebrating
literature
and
all
sorts
of
other
things
in
a
thoroughly
agreeable
and
human
fashion
it
meets
not
in
any
gloomy
hall
or
lecture
room
it
has
no
gritty
apparatus
of
blackboard
chalk
and
bleared
it
summons
its
members
and
its
guests
to
a
restaurant
of
the
west
end
it
gives
them
red
and
white
roses
for
their
and
sets
them
down
to
an
excellent
dinner
and
good
red
wine
at
a
gaily
decked
table
flower
garlanded
luminous
with
many
starry
lamps
well
as
i
say
i
found
myself
on
a
certain
night
a
partaker
of
all
this
cheerfulness
i
was
one
guest
among
many
there
were
explorers
and
ambassadors
and
great
scientific
personages
and
judges
and
the
author
who
has
given
the
world
the
best
laughter
that
it
has
enjoyed
since
dickens
died
in
a
word
i
was
in
much
more
distinguished
company
than
that
to
which
i
am
accustomed
and
after
dinner
the
persians
as
i
will
call
them
have
a
kindly
and
courteous
custom
of
praising
their
guests
and
to
my
astonishment
and
delight
the
speaker
brought
me
into
his
oration
and
said
the
kindest
and
most
glowing
things
imaginable
about
a
translation
i
once
made
of
the
heptameron
of
margaret
of
navarre
i
was
heartily
pleased
i
hold
with
foker
in
pendennis
that
every
fellow
likes
a
hand
praise
is
grateful
especially
when
there
has
not
been
too
much
of
it
but
it
is
not
to
record
my
that
i
have
told
this
incident
of
the
persian
banquet
as
i
sat
at
the
board
and
heard
the
speaker
kindly
compliments
i
was
visited
for
a
twinkling
part
of
a
moment
by
a
vision
by
such
a
vision
as
they
say
comes
to
the
spiritual
eyes
of
drowning
men
as
they
sink
through
the
green
water
the
scene
about
me
was
such
as
one
will
find
nowhere
else
but
in
london
the
multitude
of
lights
the
decoration
of
the
great
room
and
the
tables
above
all
the
nature
of
the
company
and
something
in
the
very
air
of
the
place
all
these
were
metropolitan
in
the
sense
in
which
the
word
is
opposed
to
provincial
this
is
a
subtlety
which
the
provinces
can
not
understand
and
it
is
natural
enough
that
they
are
unable
to
do
so
the
big
town
in
the
midlands
or
the
north
will
tell
you
of
its
picture
galleries
of
its
classical
concerts
and
of
the
serious
books
taken
out
in
great
numbers
from
its
flourishing
free
libraries
it
does
not
see
and
probably
will
never
see
that
none
of
these
things
is
to
the
point
well
from
the
heart
of
this
london
atmosphere
i
was
suddenly
transported
in
my
vision
to
a
darkling
solitary
country
lane
as
the
dusk
of
a
november
evening
closed
upon
it
thirty
long
years
before
and
as
i
think
that
the
pure
provincial
can
never
understand
the
quiddity
or
essence
of
london
so
i
believe
that
for
the
born
londoner
the
country
ever
remains
an
incredible
mystery
he
knows
that
it
is
there
somewhere
but
he
has
no
true
vision
of
it
in
spite
of
himself
he
londonises
it
suburbanises
it
he
sticks
a
gas
lamp
or
two
in
the
lanes
dots
some
largish
villas
of
red
brick
beside
them
and
extends
the
district
or
the
metropolitan
to
within
easy
distance
of
the
dark
wood
but
here
was
i
carried
from
luminous
oxford
street
to
the
old
deep
lane
in
gwent
which
is
on
the
borders
of
wales
nothing
that
a
londoner
would
call
a
town
within
eight
miles
deep
silence
deep
stillness
everywhere
hills
and
dark
wintry
woods
growing
dim
in
the
twilight
the
mountain
to
the
west
a
vague
huge
mass
against
a
faint
afterlight
of
the
dead
day
grey
and
heavy
clouds
massed
over
all
the
sky
i
saw
myself
a
lad
of
or
thereabouts
strolling
along
this
solitary
lane
on
a
daily
errand
bound
for
a
point
about
a
mile
from
the
rectory
here
a
footpath
over
the
fields
crossed
the
road
and
by
the
stile
i
would
wait
for
the
postman
i
would
hear
him
coming
from
far
away
for
he
blew
a
horn
as
he
walked
so
that
people
in
the
scattered
farms
might
come
out
with
their
letters
if
they
had
any
i
lounged
on
the
stile
and
waited
and
when
the
postman
came
i
would
give
him
my
packet
the
day
portion
of
copy
of
that
heptameron
translation
that
i
was
then
making
and
sending
to
the
publisher
in
york
street
covent
garden
the
postman
would
put
the
parcel
in
his
bag
cross
the
road
and
go
striding
off
into
the
dim
country
beyond
finding
his
way
on
a
track
that
no
townsman
could
see
by
field
and
wood
and
marshy
places
crossing
the
canthwr
brook
by
a
narrow
plank
coming
out
somewhere
on
the
llanfrechfa
road
and
so
entering
at
last
the
little
silent
deserted
village
that
was
once
the
golden
isca
of
the
roman
legions
that
is
golden
for
ever
and
immortal
in
the
romances
of
king
arthur
and
the
graal
and
the
round
table
so
in
an
instant
time
i
journeyed
from
the
lighted
room
in
the
big
oxford
street
restaurant
to
the
darkening
lane
in
gwent
in
years
i
gathered
anew
for
that
little
while
the
savour
of
the
autumnal
wood
beside
which
the
boy
of
thirty
years
before
was
walking
and
also
the
savour
of
his
labours
of
his
old
dreams
of
life
and
of
letters
the
speech
and
the
dream
came
to
an
end
and
the
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
who
is
probably
the
most
skilful
and
witty
writer
of
musical
comedy
lyrics
in
england
was
saying
that
once
on
a
time
he
had
tried
to
write
real
poetry
i
shall
always
esteem
it
as
the
greatest
piece
of
fortune
that
has
fallen
to
me
that
i
was
born
in
that
noble
fallen
in
the
heart
of
gwent
my
greatest
fortune
i
mean
from
that
point
of
view
which
i
now
more
especially
have
in
mind
the
career
of
letters
for
the
older
i
grow
the
more
firmly
am
i
convinced
that
anything
which
i
may
have
accomplished
in
literature
is
due
to
the
fact
that
when
my
eyes
were
first
opened
in
earliest
childhood
they
had
before
them
the
vision
of
an
enchanted
land
as
soon
as
i
saw
anything
i
saw
twyn
barlwm
that
mystic
tumulus
the
memorial
of
peoples
that
dwelt
in
that
region
before
the
celts
left
the
land
of
summer
this
guarded
the
southern
limit
of
the
great
mountain
wall
in
the
west
a
little
northward
was
mynydd
maen
the
mountain
of
the
stone
a
giant
rounded
billow
and
still
to
the
north
mountains
and
on
fair
clear
days
one
could
see
the
pointed
summit
of
the
holy
mountain
by
abergavenny
it
would
shine
i
remember
a
pure
blue
in
the
far
sunshine
it
was
a
mountain
peak
in
a
fairy
tale
and
then
to
eastward
the
bedroom
window
of
llanddewi
rectory
looked
over
hill
and
valley
over
high
woods
quivering
with
leafage
like
the
beloved
zacynthus
of
ulysses
away
to
the
forest
of
wentwood
to
the
church
tower
on
the
hill
above
caerleon
through
a
cleft
one
might
see
now
and
again
a
bright
yellow
glint
of
the
severn
sea
and
the
cliffs
of
somerset
beyond
and
hardly
a
house
in
sight
in
all
the
landscape
look
where
you
would
here
the
gable
of
a
barn
here
a
glint
of
a
whitewashed
here
blue
wood
smoke
rising
from
an
orchard
grove
where
an
old
cottage
was
snugly
hidden
but
only
so
much
if
you
knew
where
to
look
and
of
nights
when
the
dusk
fell
and
the
farmer
went
his
rounds
you
might
chance
to
see
his
lantern
glimmering
a
very
spark
on
the
hillside
this
was
all
that
showed
in
a
vague
dark
world
and
the
only
sounds
were
the
faint
distant
barking
of
the
sheepdog
and
the
melancholy
cry
of
the
owls
from
the
border
of
the
brake
i
believe
that
i
have
seen
at
all
events
the
main
streets
of
london
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
i
have
viewed
for
example
leicester
square
between
four
and
five
of
a
summer
morning
and
have
marvelled
at
its
dismal
disarray
and
quite
miserable
shabbiness
of
aspect
with
the
pure
morning
sun
shining
upon
its
gay
places
in
clear
splendour
they
are
infinitely
more
shocking
than
they
can
appear
at
to
the
narrowest
of
provincials
the
strand
is
a
solemn
street
at
two
in
the
morning
holborn
has
a
certain
vastness
and
windiness
about
it
as
the
sky
grows
from
black
to
grey
and
at
six
the
residential
quarters
seem
full
of
houses
of
mourning
their
white
blinds
most
strictly
drawn
and
at
one
time
i
had
almost
as
full
a
knowledge
of
my
native
country
though
not
so
much
with
respect
to
the
category
of
time
as
to
that
of
place
i
have
it
is
true
seen
the
sky
above
the
dark
stretch
of
wentwood
forest
redden
to
the
dawn
and
i
have
lost
my
way
and
strayed
in
a
very
maze
of
unknown
brooks
and
hills
and
woods
and
wild
lands
in
the
blackest
hours
after
midnight
but
the
habits
of
the
country
unlike
those
of
london
generally
fail
to
give
reason
or
excuse
for
night
wanderings
if
you
stayed
in
friendly
and
hospitable
company
much
after
ten
of
the
night
it
was
usually
a
case
of
the
spare
room
newly
aired
sheets
one
pipe
more
and
so
to
bed
this
at
all
events
on
nights
that
were
very
black
or
tempestuous
with
wind
and
rain
for
on
such
nights
it
is
difficult
to
make
out
the
faint
footpath
from
stile
to
stile
and
only
the
surest
sense
of
locality
will
enable
one
to
strike
the
felled
tree
or
the
narrow
plank
that
hidden
by
a
dense
growth
of
alders
crosses
the
winding
of
the
brook
but
from
very
early
years
indeed
i
became
an
enchanted
student
of
the
daylight
country
which
i
think
for
me
never
was
illuminated
by
common
daylight
but
rather
by
suns
that
rose
from
the
holy
seas
of
faery
and
sank
down
behind
magic
hills
i
was
an
only
child
and
as
soon
as
i
could
walk
beyond
the
limits
of
the
fields
and
orchards
about
the
rectory
my
father
would
take
me
with
him
on
such
parish
visitations
as
were
fairly
within
the
stretch
and
strength
of
short
legs
indeed
i
began
my
peregrinations
at
a
still
earlier
period
for
i
can
remember
a
visit
to
the
mill
that
was
paid
when
i
was
a
passenger
in
a
perambulator
and
aged
i
suppose
about
three
later
these
travels
became
more
frequent
and
i
have
recollections
still
fresh
and
pleasant
of
sitting
still
in
old
kitchens
while
my
father
was
about
his
ghostly
business
always
even
in
the
full
blaze
of
summer
there
would
be
a
glint
of
fire
on
the
cavernous
hearth
and
a
faint
blue
spire
of
wood
smoke
mounting
the
huge
hollow
of
the
chimney
the
smell
of
this
wood
smoke
scented
and
sweetened
the
air
in
which
there
was
usually
a
hint
of
apples
stored
away
in
loft
or
cellar
somewhere
behind
one
or
other
of
the
black
tarred
doors
that
opened
from
every
wall
in
the
long
low
room
and
here
and
there
bevelled
what
should
have
been
an
angle
by
the
hearth
stood
a
big
curving
settle
on
one
side
on
the
other
there
was
usually
an
armchair
for
the
wife
one
small
window
with
square
leaded
panes
with
solid
oaken
mullions
looked
out
on
the
garden
and
so
thick
were
the
walls
they
were
always
heavily
battered
or
sloped
outward
towards
the
ground
that
there
was
a
depth
of
at
least
three
feet
between
the
window
panes
and
the
inner
wall
of
the
room
there
was
whitewash
within
and
without
renewed
every
spring
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
circumstances
in
gwent
that
this
custom
of
whitewash
prevails
to
look
up
to
a
mountain
side
and
to
see
the
pure
white
of
the
walls
of
the
farms
and
cottages
established
there
fronting
great
winds
but
nestling
too
in
a
shelter
of
tossing
trees
gives
me
even
now
the
keenest
pleasure
and
if
on
a
summer
day
one
climbs
up
amidst
those
brave
winds
and
looks
down
on
all
the
rolling
land
of
gwent
it
is
dotted
with
these
white
farms
that
shine
radiant
in
the
sunlight
and
these
kitchens
were
floored
with
stone
which
was
so
purely
and
exquisitely
kept
that
people
said
one
could
eat
bread
and
butter
off
morgan
kitchen
floor
such
a
place
was
and
still
is
my
notion
of
comfort
of
the
material
surroundings
which
are
fit
to
house
a
man
now
and
then
in
these
later
days
my
business
never
my
pleasure
calls
me
to
our
hôtel
glorieux
or
our
hôtel
splendide
to
the
places
where
the
rooms
are
fifty
feet
high
where
the
walls
are
marble
and
mirrors
and
gilding
where
there
are
flowery
carpets
and
louis
quinze
chairs
and
the
true
american
heat
i
think
then
of
the
kitchens
of
pantyreos
and
penyrhaul
as
israel
in
exile
remembered
syon
but
it
is
not
in
that
it
is
best
to
remember
these
places
excellent
though
the
thought
of
their
coolness
and
refreshment
may
be
i
like
to
think
of
them
as
set
in
a
framework
of
late
autumn
or
deep
i
will
be
more
curious
than
de
quincey
no
mere
bitter
wind
or
frost
not
even
snow
will
serve
my
turn
though
each
of
these
has
its
admirable
uses
but
let
me
have
a
night
late
in
november
let
us
say
every
leaf
has
long
been
down
save
that
the
beech
hedgerow
in
the
sheltered
forest
road
will
keep
its
tawny
copper
all
through
the
winter
rain
has
been
sweeping
along
the
valleys
for
days
past
in
giant
misty
pillars
the
brooks
are
bank
high
with
red
foaming
water
down
every
steep
field
little
hedgerow
streams
come
pouring
in
the
farmyards
the
men
go
about
their
work
clad
in
sacks
and
if
they
may
will
shelter
under
penthouses
and
find
work
to
do
in
the
barns
give
me
a
night
in
the
midst
of
such
weather
and
then
think
of
the
farm
atop
the
hill
to
which
two
good
miles
of
deep
wandering
lane
go
climbing
and
mix
the
rain
with
a
great
wind
from
the
mountain
and
then
think
of
entering
the
place
which
i
have
described
set
now
for
the
old
act
of
winter
the
green
shutters
are
close
fastened
without
the
window
the
settle
is
curved
about
the
hearth
and
that
great
cavern
is
ablaze
and
glorious
with
heaped
wood
and
coals
and
the
white
walls
golden
with
the
light
of
the
leaping
flames
and
those
within
can
hear
the
rain
dashing
upon
shutter
and
upon
closed
door
and
the
fire
hisses
now
and
again
as
stray
drops
fall
down
the
chimney
and
the
great
wind
shakes
the
trees
and
goes
roaring
down
the
hillside
to
the
valley
and
moans
and
mutters
about
the
housetop
a
man
will
leave
his
place
snug
in
shelter
in
the
deepest
glow
of
the
fire
and
go
out
for
a
moment
and
open
but
a
little
of
the
door
in
the
porch
and
see
all
the
world
black
and
wild
and
wet
and
then
come
back
to
the
light
and
heat
and
thank
god
for
his
home
wondering
whether
any
are
still
abroad
on
such
a
night
of
tempest
looking
back
on
my
native
country
as
i
first
remember
it
i
have
often
regretted
that
i
was
not
born
say
twenty
or
thirty
years
earlier
i
should
then
have
seen
more
of
a
singular
social
process
which
i
can
only
call
the
passing
of
the
gentry
in
my
father
parish
this
had
taken
place
very
long
before
my
day
or
his
either
indeed
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
any
armigerous
families
had
ever
inhabited
llanddewi
though
i
have
a
dim
notion
that
certain
old
were
pointed
out
to
me
as
having
been
gentlemen
houses
but
an
adjoining
parish
had
once
held
three
very
ancient
families
of
small
gentry
one
was
still
in
existence
well
within
my
recollection
another
became
extinct
in
the
legitimate
line
soon
after
i
was
born
and
the
third
had
been
merged
in
other
and
larger
inheritances
there
were
no
perrotts
left
and
their
house
had
been
restored
and
was
occupied
as
a
farm
i
often
sat
under
their
memorials
in
the
little
church
and
admired
their
arms
three
golden
pears
and
their
crest
a
parrot
altogether
a
pretty
example
of
or
punning
heraldry
of
the
other
two
houses
one
was
a
pleasant
rambling
mouldering
place
verandahed
and
on
the
whole
more
like
a
in
touraine
than
a
country
house
in
england
the
third
mansion
was
a
house
built
in
the
l
shape
and
here
dwelt
in
my
childhood
the
last
of
the
ancient
gentry
of
the
place
even
he
was
descended
from
the
old
family
in
the
female
line
the
old
race
had
been
named
meyrick
and
they
had
given
land
in
the
thirteenth
century
that
a
light
might
burn
before
the
altar
of
a
neighbouring
church
for
ever
the
family
affirmed
that
at
one
time
they
had
owned
all
the
land
that
could
be
seen
from
a
certain
high
place
near
their
house
and
very
possibly
the
tradition
was
a
true
one
they
had
remained
faithful
to
the
latin
church
through
all
the
troubles
up
to
the
year
of
napoleon
buonaparte
sacring
as
emperor
by
the
pope
in
and
when
the
reigning
squire
of
lansoar
heard
the
news
he
raged
with
fury
and
saying
as
the
story
goes
damn
such
a
pope
as
that
left
the
roman
church
for
ever
his
grandson
whom
i
knew
always
read
the
bible
in
the
douay
version
and
praised
the
papists
indeed
he
used
often
to
end
up
addressing
my
father
in
fact
they
tell
me
that
you
more
than
half
a
roman
catholic
yourself
and
i
like
you
none
the
worse
for
it
he
was
an
extraordinary
old
man
in
his
youth
he
had
been
busy
one
morning
packing
up
his
portmanteau
to
go
to
oxford
news
came
that
his
father
was
ruined
it
was
probably
in
the
wild
smash
of
speculation
that
brought
down
sir
walter
scott
the
young
man
quietly
unpacked
his
portmanteau
and
took
possession
of
the
mill
not
many
yards
from
his
own
door
he
ground
corn
for
the
farmers
he
did
well
he
moved
into
newport
and
became
i
think
an
importer
of
irish
butter
probably
also
he
had
his
share
in
the
industrial
developments
of
glamorganshire
and
monmouthshire
then
at
the
height
of
their
prosperity
at
any
rate
in
twenty
years
or
so
the
fortunes
of
the
old
house
were
redeemed
the
of
lansoar
had
been
used
as
a
barn
for
storing
corn
in
my
day
it
was
the
most
gracious
and
grave
room
that
i
have
ever
seen
the
old
family
portraits
were
back
on
the
walls
the
old
tapestried
chairs
were
in
their
places
there
was
not
a
thing
in
the
room
less
than
a
hundred
years
old
and
the
squire
sat
beside
his
hearth
looking
as
i
have
found
out
since
those
days
exactly
like
henry
iv
of
france
he
had
travelled
a
good
deal
in
his
time
and
was
supposed
to
have
had
his
fancy
taken
by
the
clothes
he
had
seen
worn
by
the
heidelberg
students
so
he
wore
an
odd
sort
of
vestment
striped
with
black
and
dull
red
and
gathered
in
with
a
belt
of
the
same
stuff
we
called
it
a
blouse
but
it
must
have
been
something
of
the
shape
of
a
norfolk
jacket
in
the
evening
he
would
put
on
a
black
velvet
coat
which
as
he
told
me
he
got
from
poole
at
the
price
of
five
guineas
smoking
he
abominated
and
it
was
never
allowed
at
lansoar
save
when
williams
of
llangibby
was
a
guest
the
owner
of
lansoar
was
in
many
ways
a
kindly
and
benevolent
old
gentleman
but
i
think
we
in
the
country
were
chiefly
proud
of
his
temper
it
was
said
to
be
terrific
even
in
a
land
of
furious
rages
people
told
how
they
had
seen
the
old
man
white
moustache
bristling
up
to
his
eyes
this
was
a
sign
that
the
fire
was
kindled
and
as
i
once
heard
him
say
the
meyricks
always
get
white
with
love
and
hate
it
was
said
that
his
sister
was
the
only
person
who
met
him
on
something
like
equal
terms
she
was
an
ancient
gentlewoman
with
a
tremendous
aquiline
nose
and
was
more
like
a
marquise
of
going
proudly
to
instant
execution
than
can
possibly
be
imagined
she
and
her
brother
differed
it
is
much
too
mild
a
word
i
am
sure
so
fiercely
as
to
what
were
the
true
armorial
bearings
of
the
family
that
when
these
were
to
be
emblazoned
above
the
hearth
a
compromise
had
to
be
arranged
and
two
shields
were
painted
one
on
each
side
i
am
sorry
that
i
was
too
young
to
observe
lansoar
and
its
ways
with
intelligent
interest
the
people
that
lived
there
were
of
a
race
and
sort
that
have
now
perished
utterly
out
of
the
land
there
never
will
be
such
people
again
but
i
was
banished
from
lansoar
for
the
last
year
or
two
of
the
old
squire
life
i
had
left
school
and
was
at
a
loose
end
at
home
and
i
heard
i
had
fallen
under
heavy
displeasure
it
seemed
that
the
descendant
of
the
meyricks
had
known
a
doctor
who
had
lived
in
paris
on
five
shillings
a
week
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
wished
to
know
why
i
was
not
living
in
london
on
five
shillings
a
week
in
the
answer
would
have
been
that
i
had
neither
five
shillings
nor
five
pence
a
week
but
one
did
not
answer
james
of
lansoar
i
am
heartily
sorry
that
the
class
which
he
represented
has
perished
i
am
sorry
to
think
of
all
their
houses
scattered
over
gwent
now
mere
memorials
of
something
that
is
done
for
ever
and
ended
one
came
upon
these
houses
in
every
other
valley
on
every
other
hillside
looking
pleasantly
towards
the
setting
sun
they
are
noble
old
places
even
though
they
are
noble
in
a
humble
way
there
are
no
haddon
halls
in
gwent
but
these
old
homes
of
the
small
gentry
of
the
borderland
now
for
the
most
part
used
as
show
their
lineage
in
the
dignity
of
their
proportions
in
the
carved
armorial
bearings
of
their
porches
the
pride
of
race
that
belonged
to
the
morgans
herberts
meyricks
that
once
lived
in
them
has
passed
into
their
stones
and
still
shines
there
there
is
a
great
book
that
i
am
hoping
to
write
one
of
these
fine
days
i
have
been
hoping
to
write
it
i
may
say
since
or
and
somewhere
about
the
latter
year
i
did
write
as
many
as
a
dozen
pages
the
so
far
conducted
did
not
wholly
displease
me
and
yet
it
was
not
good
enough
to
urge
me
forward
in
the
task
and
so
it
has
languished
ever
since
then
and
i
am
afraid
i
have
lost
the
mss
that
contained
all
that
there
was
of
it
long
ago
seriously
of
course
it
would
not
have
been
a
great
book
if
it
had
been
ever
so
prosperously
continued
and
ended
but
it
would
have
been
at
least
a
curious
book
and
even
now
i
feel
conscious
of
warm
desire
at
the
thought
of
writing
it
some
day
for
the
idea
of
it
came
to
me
as
follows
i
had
been
thinking
at
the
old
century
end
of
the
work
that
i
had
done
in
the
fifteen
years
or
so
before
and
it
suddenly
dawned
upon
me
that
this
work
pretty
good
or
pretty
bad
or
as
it
may
be
had
all
been
the
expression
of
one
formula
one
endeavour
what
i
had
been
doing
was
this
i
had
been
inventing
tales
in
which
and
by
which
i
had
tried
to
realise
my
boyish
impressions
of
that
wonderful
magic
gwent
say
that
i
had
walked
and
wandered
by
unknown
roads
and
suddenly
after
climbing
a
gentle
hill
had
seen
before
me
for
the
first
time
the
valley
of
the
usk
just
above
newbridge
i
think
it
was
on
one
of
those
strange
days
of
summer
when
the
sky
is
at
once
grey
and
luminous
that
i
achieved
this
adventure
there
are
no
clouds
in
the
upper
air
the
sky
is
simply
covered
with
a
veil
which
is
as
i
say
both
grey
and
luminous
and
there
is
no
breath
of
wind
and
every
leaf
is
still
but
now
and
again
as
the
day
goes
on
the
veil
will
brighten
and
the
sun
almost
appear
and
then
here
and
there
in
the
woods
it
is
as
if
white
moons
were
descending
on
such
a
day
then
i
saw
that
wonderful
and
most
lovely
valley
the
usk
here
purged
of
its
muddy
tidal
waters
now
like
the
sky
grey
and
silvery
and
luminous
winding
in
mystic
esses
and
the
dense
forest
bending
down
to
it
and
the
grey
stone
bridge
crossing
it
down
the
valley
in
the
distance
was
over
the
hill
somewhere
in
the
lower
slopes
of
the
forest
caerwent
also
a
roman
city
was
buried
in
the
earth
and
gave
up
now
and
again
strange
relics
fragments
of
the
temple
of
nodens
god
of
the
depths
i
saw
the
lonely
house
between
the
dark
forest
and
the
silver
river
and
years
after
i
wrote
the
great
god
pan
an
endeavour
to
pass
on
the
vague
indefinable
sense
of
awe
and
mystery
and
terror
that
i
had
received
this
then
was
my
process
to
invent
a
story
which
would
recreate
those
vague
impressions
of
wonder
and
awe
and
mystery
that
i
myself
had
received
from
the
form
and
shape
of
the
land
of
my
boyhood
and
youth
and
as
i
thought
over
this
and
meditated
on
the
futility
or
comparative
futility
of
the
plot
however
ingenious
which
did
not
exist
to
express
emotions
of
one
kind
or
another
it
struck
me
that
it
might
be
possible
to
reverse
the
process
could
one
describe
hills
and
valleys
woods
and
rivers
sunrise
and
sunset
buried
temples
and
mouldering
roman
walls
so
that
a
story
should
be
suggested
to
the
reader
not
of
course
a
story
of
material
incidents
not
a
story
with
a
plot
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
but
an
interior
tale
of
the
soul
and
its
emotions
could
such
a
tale
be
suggested
in
the
way
i
have
indicated
such
is
to
be
the
plan
of
the
great
book
which
is
not
yet
written
i
mention
it
here
chiefly
because
i
would
lay
stress
on
my
doctrine
that
in
the
world
of
imagination
the
child
is
indeed
father
of
the
man
that
the
man
is
nothing
more
than
the
child
with
an
improved
understanding
certainly
with
all
sorts
of
technical
advantages
in
the
way
of
information
and
in
the
arts
of
expression
but
on
the
other
hand
with
the
disadvantages
of
a
dimmed
imaginative
eye
and
a
weakened
vision
there
have
been
a
few
men
who
have
kept
the
awe
and
the
surmise
of
earlier
years
and
have
added
to
those
miraculous
gifts
the
acquired
accomplishments
of
age
and
instruction
and
these
are
the
only
men
who
are
entitled
to
the
name
of
genius
i
have
said
already
that
in
my
boyhood
and
youth
i
was
a
deep
and
learned
student
of
the
country
about
my
home
and
that
i
always
saw
it
as
a
kind
of
fairyland
and
my
memory
i
find
that
i
have
in
no
way
exaggerated
or
overcoloured
these
early
and
earliest
impressions
fairyland
is
too
precise
a
word
i
would
rather
say
that
i
saw
everything
in
something
of
the
spirit
in
which
the
first
explorers
gazed
on
the
tropical
luxuriance
and
strangeness
of
the
south
american
forests
on
the
rock
cities
of
peru
on
the
unconjectured
seas
that
burst
upon
them
from
that
peak
in
darien
on
the
wholly
unimagined
splendours
of
the
mexican
monarchy
so
it
was
with
me
as
a
child
i
came
into
a
strange
country
and
strange
it
ever
remained
to
me
so
that
when
i
left
it
for
ever
there
were
still
hills
within
sight
and
yet
untrodden
lanes
and
paths
of
which
i
knew
the
beginning
but
not
the
end
for
it
is
to
be
understood
that
country
folk
are
in
this
respect
like
londoners
that
they
have
their
customary
tracks
and
ways
which
lead
more
or
less
to
some
end
or
other
it
is
only
occasionally
that
either
goes
out
determined
not
to
find
his
way
but
to
lose
it
to
stray
for
the
very
sake
of
straying
thus
i
walked
many
times
in
wentwood
and
became
familiar
with
the
roman
road
that
passes
for
some
distance
along
the
summit
of
that
ancient
forest
but
only
once
i
think
did
i
set
out
from
the
yellow
verge
of
the
severn
and
cross
the
level
moors
a
belt
of
fen
country
that
might
well
lie
between
ely
and
brandon
really
no
doubt
y
môr
the
sea
and
wonder
for
a
while
at
the
bastioned
and
battlemented
ruins
of
caldicot
castle
and
so
mount
up
by
the
outer
hills
and
woods
of
the
forest
through
caerwent
past
the
oaks
a
grove
of
trees
that
were
almost
awful
in
the
magnificence
of
their
age
and
their
decay
and
so
climb
to
the
ridge
and
look
down
on
the
usk
and
the
more
familiar
regions
to
the
west
and
as
you
may
judge
it
was
only
the
knowledge
that
one
must
not
frighten
one
family
out
of
its
wits
and
that
camping
out
in
forests
without
food
or
drink
is
highly
inconvenient
that
kept
me
on
this
comparatively
straight
path
so
all
the
while
as
i
paced
an
unknown
way
yet
more
unknowns
were
beckoning
to
me
on
right
and
left
paths
full
of
promise
allured
me
into
green
depths
the
wildest
heights
urged
me
to
attempt
them
cottages
in
orchard
dells
seemed
so
isolated
from
all
the
world
that
they
and
theirs
must
be
a
part
of
enchantment
and
so
i
crossed
wentwood
and
felt
not
that
i
knew
it
but
that
it
was
hardly
to
be
known
i
have
already
mentioned
i
think
that
i
was
an
only
child
add
to
this
statement
that
i
had
no
little
cousins
available
as
some
of
these
being
domiciled
in
anglesea
others
in
london
that
it
was
only
by
the
merest
chance
and
on
the
rarest
occasions
that
i
ever
saw
any
children
at
all
and
i
have
given
some
notion
of
the
extreme
solitude
of
my
upbringing
i
grew
up
therefore
all
alone
so
far
as
other
children
were
concerned
and
though
i
went
to
school
school
did
not
seem
to
make
much
difference
to
my
habit
of
mind
i
was
eleven
years
old
at
the
time
and
i
suppose
i
was
set
to
loneliness
i
passed
the
term
as
a
sort
of
interlude
amongst
strangers
and
came
home
to
my
friendly
lanes
to
my
deep
and
shadowy
and
secret
valleys
as
a
man
returns
to
his
dear
ones
and
his
dear
native
fields
after
exile
amongst
aliens
and
outlanders
i
came
back
then
again
and
again
to
solitude
there
were
no
parties
for
me
no
cricket
no
football
and
i
was
heartily
glad
of
it
for
i
should
have
abhorred
all
these
diversions
with
shudderings
of
body
and
spirit
my
father
and
mother
apart
i
loved
to
be
by
myself
with
unlimited
leisure
for
mooning
and
loafing
and
roaming
and
wandering
from
lane
to
lane
from
wood
to
wood
constantly
i
seemed
to
be
finding
new
hitherto
unsuspected
tracks
to
be
emerging
from
deep
lanes
and
climbing
hills
so
far
but
seen
from
the
distance
matters
of
surmise
and
now
trodden
and
found
to
be
darien
peaks
giving
an
outlook
upon
strange
worlds
of
river
and
forest
and
slope
wondering
at
these
things
i
never
ceased
to
wonder
and
even
when
i
knew
a
certain
path
and
became
familiar
with
it
i
never
lost
my
sense
of
its
marvels
as
they
appeared
to
me
i
have
read
curious
and
perplexed
commentaries
on
that
place
in
sir
thomas
browne
in
which
he
declares
his
life
up
to
the
period
of
the
religio
medici
to
have
been
a
miracle
of
thirty
years
which
to
relate
were
not
a
history
but
a
piece
of
poetry
johnson
summing
up
the
known
events
of
browne
early
life
finds
therein
nothing
in
the
least
miraculous
southey
says
the
miracle
was
the
great
preservation
from
atheism
leslie
stephen
considers
that
the
strangeness
consists
rather
in
browne
view
of
his
own
history
than
in
any
unusual
phenomena
view
of
his
own
history
seems
a
little
vague
but
however
critical
sagacity
may
determine
the
sense
of
the
passage
i
would
very
willingly
adopt
it
to
describe
these
early
years
of
mine
spent
in
that
rectory
amongst
the
wild
hills
of
gwent
of
my
private
opinion
i
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
when
sir
thomas
browne
used
the
word
miraculous
he
was
thinking
not
of
miracles
in
the
accepted
sense
as
things
done
contrary
to
the
generally
observed
laws
of
nature
but
rather
of
his
vision
of
the
world
of
his
sense
of
a
constant
wonder
latent
in
all
things
stevenson
i
believe
had
some
sense
of
this
doctrine
as
applied
to
landscape
at
least
when
he
said
that
there
were
certain
scenes
i
forget
how
he
particularised
them
which
demanded
their
stories
which
cried
out
as
it
were
to
have
tales
indited
to
fit
their
singular
aspects
this
i
think
i
have
shown
is
a
crude
analysis
i
should
put
it
thus
this
group
of
pines
this
lonely
shore
or
whatever
the
scene
may
be
has
made
the
soul
thrill
with
an
emotion
intense
but
vague
in
the
sense
in
which
music
is
vague
and
the
man
of
letters
does
his
best
to
realise
rather
perhaps
to
actualise
this
emotion
by
inventing
a
tale
about
the
pines
or
the
sands
such
at
all
events
was
my
state
through
all
the
years
of
boyhood
and
of
youth
everything
to
me
was
wonderful
everything
visible
was
the
veil
of
an
invisible
secret
before
an
oddly
shaped
stone
i
was
ready
to
fall
into
a
sort
of
reverie
or
meditation
as
if
it
had
been
a
fragment
of
paradise
or
fairyland
there
was
a
certain
herb
of
the
fields
that
grew
plentifully
in
gwent
that
even
now
i
can
not
regard
without
a
kind
of
reverence
it
bears
a
spire
of
small
yellow
blossoms
and
its
leaves
when
crushed
give
out
a
very
pungent
aromatic
odour
this
odour
was
to
me
a
separate
revelation
or
mystery
as
if
no
one
in
the
world
had
smelt
it
but
myself
and
i
ceased
not
to
admire
even
when
a
countryman
told
me
that
it
was
good
for
stone
if
you
gathered
it
under
the
planet
juniper
and
here
may
i
say
in
passing
that
in
my
opinion
the
country
parson
with
all
the
class
knows
next
to
nothing
of
the
true
minds
of
the
country
folk
i
feel
certain
that
my
father
if
asked
by
a
royal
commission
or
some
such
valuable
body
what
influence
has
astrology
on
your
parishioners
would
have
answered
they
have
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
later
years
i
have
wondered
as
to
the
possible
fields
which
extended
beyond
the
bounds
of
our
ignorance
i
have
wondered
for
example
whether
by
any
possibility
there
were
waxen
men
with
pins
in
them
hidden
in
very
secret
nooks
in
any
of
the
llanddewi
cottages
but
this
is
a
mere
to
return
to
my
topic
to
that
attitude
of
the
which
almost
says
in
its
heart
things
are
because
they
are
wonderful
i
am
reminded
of
one
of
the
secret
societies
with
which
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
connected
this
particular
society
issued
a
little
volume
of
instructions
to
those
who
were
to
be
initiated
and
amongst
these
instructions
was
the
note
remember
that
nothing
exists
which
is
not
god
how
can
i
possibly
realise
that
i
said
to
one
of
the
members
of
the
society
when
i
read
it
i
was
looking
at
the
tiles
on
each
side
of
my
fireplace
in
gray
inn
and
they
are
of
the
beastliest
design
it
is
possible
to
imagine
i
really
can
not
see
anything
of
divinity
in
those
tiles
i
do
not
remember
how
my
objection
was
met
i
do
think
it
was
met
but
looking
back
i
believe
that
as
a
child
i
realised
something
of
the
spirit
of
the
mystic
injunction
everywhere
through
the
darkness
and
the
mists
of
the
childish
understanding
and
yet
by
the
light
of
the
illumination
i
saw
the
whole
earth
down
to
the
very
pebbles
was
but
the
veil
of
a
quickening
and
adorable
mystery
hazlitt
said
that
the
man
of
genius
spent
his
whole
life
in
telling
the
world
what
he
had
known
himself
when
he
was
eighteen
waiving
utterly
i
am
sorry
to
say
the
title
of
man
of
genius
i
would
reaffirm
proposition
on
lower
grounds
i
would
say
that
he
who
has
any
traffic
with
the
affairs
of
the
imagination
has
found
out
all
the
wisdom
that
he
will
ever
know
in
this
life
at
all
events
by
the
age
of
eighteen
or
thereabouts
and
it
is
probable
that
hazlitt
though
he
never
dreamed
of
it
was
but
those
sentences
in
the
holy
gospels
which
deal
with
the
intimate
relationship
between
children
and
the
kingdom
of
heaven
in
the
popular
conception
of
course
both
amongst
priests
and
people
these
texts
are
understood
to
refer
to
the
innocence
of
childhood
but
a
little
reflection
will
satisfy
anyone
that
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
children
are
only
innocent
as
a
stone
is
innocent
as
a
stick
is
innocent
that
is
they
are
incapable
of
committing
the
special
offences
which
to
our
modern
and
utterly
degraded
system
of
popular
ethics
constitute
the
whole
matter
of
morality
and
immorality
i
remember
a
few
years
ago
reading
how
an
illustrious
primitive
methodist
testified
on
the
sacred
mount
of
primitive
methodism
at
some
anniversary
of
the
society
he
said
that
his
old
grandmother
had
implored
him
when
he
was
a
boy
never
to
drink
never
to
gamble
never
to
break
the
sabbath
and
he
concluded
triumphantly
i
have
never
done
any
of
these
things
therefore
i
am
a
good
christian
is
the
conclusion
evidently
suggested
this
poor
man
it
may
be
said
knew
no
better
but
i
am
much
mistaken
if
the
majority
of
our
anglican
clergy
would
not
accept
his
statement
as
a
good
confession
of
the
faith
the
new
testament
for
all
these
people
has
been
written
in
vain
they
will
still
believe
that
a
good
christian
is
one
who
drinks
a
cup
of
cocoa
at
and
is
in
bed
by
ten
sharp
and
to
such
persons
of
course
the
texts
which
assert
the
necessity
of
becoming
like
little
children
if
we
would
enter
the
kingdom
of
heaven
are
clear
enough
it
is
a
mere
matter
of
early
hours
and
plenty
of
cocoa
or
perhaps
of
warm
bread
and
milk
but
personally
i
can
not
at
all
symbolise
with
them
i
look
back
to
the
time
when
the
mountain
and
the
tiny
shining
stone
the
flower
and
the
brook
were
all
alike
signs
and
evidences
of
an
ineffable
mystery
and
beauty
i
see
myself
all
alone
in
the
valley
under
hanging
woods
of
a
still
summer
evening
entranced
wondering
what
the
secret
was
that
was
here
almost
told
and
then
i
am
persuaded
i
came
near
to
the
spirit
of
thomas
aquinas
te
devote
latens
there
comes
to
me
from
very
long
ago
the
memory
of
a
burning
afternoon
in
the
hot
heart
of
july
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
was
in
the
dry
summer
this
was
in
or
i
am
not
certain
which
and
it
was
notable
for
many
things
in
my
recollection
firstly
the
mountain
caught
fire
this
sounds
a
terrific
and
unlikely
statement
considered
with
relation
to
the
temperate
and
reasonable
geology
of
this
land
which
has
known
nothing
for
many
æons
of
volcanoes
or
burning
mountains
what
had
happened
of
course
was
that
the
heather
and
wild
growth
on
the
mountain
had
somehow
been
fired
and
so
all
through
that
hot
august
i
remember
looking
westward
to
the
great
mountain
wall
and
watching
the
dun
fume
that
drifted
along
its
highest
places
looking
with
a
certain
dread
for
there
was
something
apocalyptic
in
the
sight
another
notable
event
was
the
failure
of
the
water
supply
the
rectory
stood
almost
on
top
of
a
long
hill
that
mounted
up
from
the
valley
of
the
soar
there
were
no
ponds
or
tanks
in
its
curtilage
and
the
drought
of
this
year
exhausted
the
water
in
the
great
butt
that
stood
in
the
yard
and
received
the
streams
from
the
roof
in
rainy
weather
this
of
course
was
not
drinking
water
that
we
obtained
always
from
a
well
deep
in
the
brake
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
and
without
contempt
for
other
and
more
elaborate
beverages
i
may
say
that
there
are
few
draughts
more
delicious
than
cold
dripping
from
the
rock
and
shaded
in
its
hollow
basin
by
the
overhanging
trees
our
london
water
is
i
believe
perfectly
wholesome
but
it
is
absolutely
tasteless
no
doubt
through
the
manifold
purifications
and
purgations
which
it
has
undergone
but
has
a
savour
and
a
character
of
its
own
and
the
product
of
one
well
will
often
differ
in
a
very
marked
degree
from
that
of
another
before
my
day
oddly
enough
we
had
in
the
county
a
connoisseur
or
gourmet
of
wells
he
was
a
clergyman
and
he
had
been
heard
to
boast
that
he
had
tasted
the
water
of
every
well
in
the
forest
of
wentwood
our
own
well
in
the
rectory
brake
was
thought
excellently
of
by
good
judges
of
clear
cold
water
i
think
it
was
in
this
year
of
the
burning
mountain
that
the
rectory
paid
a
call
on
and
roger
gibbon
of
the
wern
on
a
blazing
afternoon
they
were
very
old
people
and
the
stock
of
the
gibbons
i
am
not
using
their
real
name
was
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
honoured
in
the
land
of
gwent
i
suppose
indeed
that
they
would
look
on
many
dukes
as
parvenus
of
yesterday
furthermore
this
branch
of
the
race
was
quite
comfortable
and
in
money
matters
they
received
my
father
and
my
mother
and
myself
with
the
heartiest
kindness
they
had
known
my
father
from
his
boyhood
and
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
some
refreshment
so
presently
the
maid
came
in
with
a
tray
and
old
roger
solemnly
mixed
for
my
father
and
mother
for
his
wife
and
himself
four
reeking
glasses
of
hot
gin
i
think
that
all
things
considered
this
was
the
very
strangest
refreshment
ever
offered
the
old
people
swallowed
their
boiling
spirit
with
relish
my
parents
took
their
dose
with
shuddering
politeness
and
the
thermometer
rose
steadily
roger
and
caroline
had
been
quarrelling
about
a
carpet
before
we
came
and
after
a
decent
interval
the
quarrel
was
resumed
roger
addressed
himself
to
my
mother
she
would
buy
it
too
small
i
told
her
it
would
be
too
small
and
there
it
is
with
three
or
four
feet
of
the
floor
showing
and
what
do
you
think
she
says
machen
she
says
she
will
have
the
bare
boards
painted
green
to
match
the
carpet
i
say
that
ridiculous
do
you
think
so
without
waiting
for
an
answer
and
bellowing
to
deaf
old
caroline
there
caroline
i
told
you
what
everyone
would
say
machen
says
it
ridiculous
the
idea
of
painting
the
boards
green
and
the
old
man
turning
to
my
father
told
him
in
a
lower
voice
and
with
considerable
enjoyment
of
some
wine
that
his
wife
had
concocted
she
had
stored
it
in
a
cupboard
in
their
bedroom
and
roger
told
how
he
used
to
lie
awake
at
night
laughing
as
he
listened
to
the
bottles
bursting
the
old
lady
being
much
too
deaf
to
hear
the
reports
old
gibbon
was
an
expert
shot
but
he
could
never
be
persuaded
to
use
the
percussion
caps
he
brought
down
his
birds
to
the
last
by
means
of
flint
and
steel
he
was
an
enthusiastic
fox
hunter
also
but
he
never
hunted
on
horseback
up
to
something
past
the
middle
of
his
life
the
llangibby
hounds
had
been
hunted
afoot
the
rector
of
llangibby
being
the
master
and
afoot
roger
gibbon
followed
them
up
to
his
old
age
and
so
cunning
had
he
become
in
matter
of
wind
and
scent
and
lie
of
the
country
that
he
rarely
failed
to
be
in
at
the
death
i
doubt
whether
he
knew
much
of
the
world
outside
of
a
radius
caerleon
being
taken
as
the
centre
of
the
circle
but
when
roger
gibbon
was
quite
an
old
man
people
told
him
that
he
ought
to
see
london
so
he
went
to
london
he
walked
out
of
paddington
station
and
saw
london
as
he
thought
and
filled
with
a
great
horror
and
disgust
and
terror
at
what
he
had
seen
he
trotted
back
into
the
station
and
paced
the
platform
till
the
next
train
for
the
west
started
he
got
into
that
train
and
returned
to
the
wern
and
to
the
shelter
and
companionship
of
his
hills
and
woods
and
there
abode
till
the
ending
of
his
long
days
it
was
strange
how
in
those
times
people
were
fixed
in
the
soil
so
that
for
many
miles
round
everybody
knew
everybody
or
at
least
knew
of
everybody
it
is
all
over
i
suppose
and
again
i
think
it
is
a
pity
that
it
is
over
it
was
a
part
of
the
old
life
of
the
friendly
fires
and
the
friendly
faces
and
when
rarely
enough
in
this
great
desert
of
london
i
meet
a
friend
of
those
old
days
i
think
we
both
feel
as
if
we
were
surviving
tribesmen
of
some
sept
that
has
been
literally
annihilated
or
almost
decimated
to
use
our
modern
english
one
says
do
you
remember
that
walk
over
mynydd
fawr
to
the
holy
well
the
other
replies
how
good
the
beer
at
the
three
salmons
tasted
that
day
we
walked
all
the
way
from
caerleon
on
the
old
usk
road
let
me
see
when
was
that
april
and
we
look
on
one
another
and
lo
our
heads
have
whitened
and
our
eyes
are
beginning
to
grow
dim
but
as
an
instance
of
the
fellowship
and
brotherhood
that
there
was
in
the
land
of
gwent
in
the
old
days
here
is
a
true
story
i
have
told
of
fierce
old
james
of
lansoar
the
ancient
squire
well
there
had
been
a
raging
and
tremendous
quarrel
between
james
and
a
neighbouring
farmer
called
williams
and
as
williams
was
an
honest
and
excellent
and
placable
old
man
there
was
not
much
doubt
as
to
who
was
the
aggressor
after
years
of
hate
on
one
side
at
all
events
a
false
rumour
went
about
the
county
that
james
had
lost
all
his
money
in
turkish
bonds
i
think
then
did
old
williams
the
farmer
go
up
one
night
secretly
to
old
james
the
squire
and
altogether
heedless
of
the
white
face
and
the
furious
glance
and
the
bristling
moustache
that
greeted
him
he
offered
all
he
had
to
his
enemy
may
he
remember
me
from
his
happy
place
by
this
time
i
hope
that
i
have
made
a
sort
of
picture
of
my
conditions
as
they
were
up
to
the
time
that
i
left
school
at
the
age
of
seventeen
solitude
and
woods
and
deep
lanes
and
wonder
these
were
the
chief
elements
of
my
life
one
thing
however
i
have
so
far
omitted
that
is
the
matter
of
books
which
i
will
now
consider
and
firstly
i
must
record
with
deep
thankfulness
the
circumstance
that
as
soon
as
i
could
read
i
had
the
run
of
a
thoroughly
library
or
rather
of
a
library
that
had
not
been
selected
at
all
my
father
collection
if
that
serious
word
may
be
applied
to
a
of
books
had
grown
up
anyhow
and
nohow
and
in
it
the
most
revered
stocks
had
mingled
with
the
most
frivolous
there
were
the
fathers
in
the
english
version
made
by
the
tractarians
and
there
was
also
no
end
of
yellowbacks
bought
at
smith
bookstalls
on
railway
journeys
there
was
a
row
of
little
elzevir
classics
with
the
sphere
bound
in
parchment
that
had
grown
golden
with
its
two
hundred
and
odd
years
there
was
also
verdant
green
in
his
tattered
paper
wrapper
as
my
father
had
bought
him
at
oxford
next
to
verdant
green
you
might
very
likely
find
the
dialogues
of
erasmus
in
leather
and
borrow
in
his
original
boards
we
read
borrow
at
llanddewi
long
before
there
were
any
borrovians
might
hide
an
odd
volume
of
martin
chuzzlewit
in
a
railway
edition
which
had
tumbled
to
the
back
of
the
shelf
hard
by
stood
copleston
prælectiones
academicæ
and
close
to
it
a
complete
set
of
brontë
books
including
gaskell
life
all
these
in
yellowish
linen
covers
being
i
imagine
the
first
edition
issued
by
the
publishers
and
here
again
llanddewi
in
the
woods
may
claim
to
have
been
in
advance
of
its
age
for
we
were
devoted
to
the
name
of
brontë
suppose
the
weather
did
not
beckon
me
i
would
begin
to
go
about
the
house
on
the
search
of
books
i
might
have
wuthering
heights
in
my
mind
and
be
chasing
that
amazing
volume
very
closely
and
be
in
fact
hot
on
the
scent
when
i
would
be
brought
up
sharply
by
my
hebrew
grammar
i
always
loved
the
shape
and
show
of
the
hebrew
character
and
have
meant
to
learn
the
language
from
onwards
but
have
not
yet
thoroughly
mastered
the
alphabet
i
once
indeed
got
so
advanced
as
to
be
able
to
spell
out
the
yiddish
posters
which
cover
the
walls
in
the
east
end
of
london
and
i
remember
being
much
amused
when
i
had
deciphered
a
most
mystic
word
and
found
that
it
read
bishopsgyte
but
i
believe
that
in
yiddish
the
two
yods
represent
the
a
sound
well
this
hebrew
grammar
would
distract
me
from
the
hunt
of
emily
brontë
masterpiece
and
by
the
time
i
had
decided
that
monday
would
be
soon
enough
for
a
serious
beginning
in
hebrew
while
i
meditated
in
the
meanwhile
on
the
beauty
of
the
names
of
the
four
classes
of
accents
emperors
kings
princes
and
dukes
i
think
it
was
likely
enough
that
i
had
got
hold
of
alison
history
of
europe
or
the
bible
in
spain
or
a
book
on
brasses
and
by
the
time
i
had
gloated
over
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
as
described
in
alison
or
had
marvelled
at
borrow
in
the
character
of
a
protestant
colporteur
or
had
admired
the
pictured
brasses
of
sir
robert
de
septvans
sir
roger
de
trumpington
winnowing
fans
on
the
of
the
one
trumpets
on
the
shield
of
the
other
and
abbot
delamere
of
albans
it
was
and
i
probably
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
a
bound
volume
of
chambers
journal
all
the
year
round
cornhill
or
the
welcome
guest
these
were
always
a
great
resource
and
i
particularly
wish
that
i
still
possessed
the
welcome
guest
a
popular
weekly
dating
from
the
late
of
last
century
it
was
full
of
work
by
people
who
afterwards
became
famous
and
now
again
are
fading
into
forgetfulness
john
hollingshead
we
still
remember
though
it
is
only
the
elderly
who
can
tell
much
now
of
the
sacred
lamp
of
burlesque
which
was
kept
burning
at
the
gaiety
hollingshead
was
a
contributor
to
the
welcome
guest
so
also
were
the
brothers
mayhew
and
the
brothers
brough
so
on
a
great
scale
was
george
augustus
sala
who
wrote
in
it
twice
round
the
clock
and
something
that
was
called
i
fancy
make
your
game
or
the
adventures
of
the
stout
gentleman
the
thin
gentleman
and
the
man
with
the
iron
chest
this
was
a
lively
account
of
a
visit
to
the
gaming
tables
then
existing
in
germany
the
stout
gentleman
was
one
of
the
mayhews
the
man
with
the
iron
chest
was
sala
himself
and
i
met
the
thin
gentleman
many
years
afterwards
in
a
in
catherine
street
where
i
was
cataloguing
books
on
magic
and
alchemy
and
the
secret
arts
in
general
the
was
over
the
vizetellys
publishing
office
and
the
thin
gentleman
was
old
vizetelly
we
larned
him
to
publish
a
translation
of
la
terre
by
sending
him
an
old
man
past
seventy
to
gaol
for
three
months
he
died
soon
afterwards
i
forget
whether
his
death
took
place
before
or
after
the
very
handsome
and
official
and
respectable
reception
and
entertainment
that
were
given
to
zola
on
his
visiting
england
i
must
say
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
old
welcome
guest
volume
again
i
am
afraid
i
should
not
admire
its
literature
very
much
for
sala
the
chief
contributor
had
already
acquired
those
vicious
mannerisms
which
pleased
the
injudicious
he
would
speak
of
billingsgate
as
a
piscatorial
bourse
for
instance
i
am
afraid
i
should
find
it
all
terribly
but
i
should
like
to
hold
the
fat
volume
again
and
glance
through
its
pages
for
they
would
bring
back
to
me
the
long
winter
evenings
and
the
rectory
fire
burning
cheerfully
and
the
heavy
red
curtains
drawn
close
over
the
windows
shutting
out
the
night
i
must
say
that
i
found
a
great
joy
and
resource
in
these
old
magazines
if
one
were
in
a
mood
averse
from
reading
in
the
solid
block
if
the
hour
did
not
seem
propitious
for
beginning
once
more
pickwick
from
the
beginning
it
was
a
delight
to
think
of
those
bound
volumes
all
in
a
row
and
of
the
inexhaustible
supply
of
mixed
literature
which
they
contained
for
just
as
there
was
always
the
chance
and
indeed
the
likelihood
of
making
new
discoveries
in
the
happy
confusion
of
the
llanddewi
library
so
it
was
with
these
rows
of
household
words
chambers
all
the
year
round
welcome
guest
and
cornhill
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
a
find
some
tale
or
essay
hitherto
overlooked
or
neglected
might
turn
out
to
be
full
of
matter
and
entertainment
and
so
the
most
unlikely
events
happened
you
would
expect
to
find
good
things
of
all
sorts
in
a
magazine
edited
by
charles
dickens
but
you
would
hardly
expect
to
find
there
the
curious
thing
or
the
thing
still
it
was
in
a
volume
of
household
words
that
i
first
read
about
alchemy
in
a
short
series
of
papers
which
i
have
since
recognised
were
singularly
and
enlightened
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
i
myself
have
any
strong
convictions
on
the
matter
of
turning
inferior
metals
into
superior
though
i
believe
the
later
trend
of
science
is
certainly
in
favour
of
the
theoretical
possibility
of
such
a
process
nor
do
i
hold
any
distinct
brief
for
the
very
fascinating
doctrine
which
maintains
or
would
like
to
maintain
that
the
great
alchemical
books
are
really
symbolical
books
that
while
seeming
to
relate
to
lead
and
gold
to
mercury
and
silver
they
hide
under
these
figures
intimations
as
to
a
profound
and
ineffable
transmutation
of
the
spirit
that
the
experiment
to
which
they
relate
is
the
great
experiment
of
the
mystics
which
is
the
experiment
of
god
this
i
say
is
a
fascinating
theory
whether
it
have
any
truth
in
it
i
know
not
and
perhaps
it
is
one
of
those
questions
of
which
sir
thomas
browne
speaks
questions
difficult
indeed
and
perplexed
but
not
beyond
all
conjecture
but
however
this
may
be
i
recollect
that
those
articles
in
that
old
bound
volume
of
household
words
while
not
affirming
this
that
or
the
other
doctrine
as
to
alchemy
in
so
many
distinct
words
did
suggest
that
a
few
of
the
old
alchemists
at
all
events
were
something
more
than
blundering
simpletons
engaged
on
a
quest
which
was
a
patent
absurdity
which
could
only
have
been
entertained
by
the
besotted
superstition
of
the
dark
ages
which
had
this
one
claim
to
our
attention
inasmuch
as
the
modern
science
of
chemistry
rose
from
the
ashes
of
its
foolish
fires
this
is
not
the
place
for
a
discussion
of
the
art
of
thrice
great
hermes
the
matter
is
cited
here
as
an
example
of
the
odd
and
unexpected
way
in
which
my
attention
i
being
some
eight
or
nine
years
old
was
directed
to
a
singular
and
perplexing
subject
which
has
engaged
my
curiosity
at
intervals
ever
since
i
see
myself
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
rectory
hearth
propping
up
household
words
against
the
fender
quite
ravished
by
the
story
of
nicholas
flamel
who
found
by
chance
the
book
of
abraham
the
jew
who
journeyed
all
over
europe
in
search
of
one
who
would
interpret
its
figures
to
him
who
succeeded
at
last
in
the
operation
of
the
great
work
and
was
discovered
by
the
chamberlain
living
in
great
simplicity
eating
cabbage
soup
with
pernelle
his
wife
these
fireside
studies
of
mine
must
have
been
made
or
years
ago
but
i
still
think
the
story
of
nicholas
flamel
and
pernelle
his
wife
an
enchanting
one
but
then
i
the
tale
of
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
only
the
other
day
and
i
am
still
thrilled
and
perplexed
by
that
most
singular
and
important
fact
that
the
genie
declared
himself
to
be
the
servant
of
the
roc
egg
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
confess
that
the
rectory
shelves
held
no
copy
of
the
arabian
nights
i
made
up
this
deficiency
soon
after
i
went
to
school
by
buying
an
excellent
edition
issued
i
think
by
routledge
for
a
shilling
this
edition
is
now
the
booksellers
tell
me
out
of
print
and
it
is
a
pity
for
now
if
you
want
the
book
there
is
nothing
between
an
edition
obviously
meant
for
the
nursery
with
gaudy
plates
and
lane
version
for
thirty
shillings
i
speak
not
of
burton
for
i
found
myself
unable
to
read
a
couple
of
pages
of
his
detestable
english
made
more
terrible
by
the
imitations
of
the
rhymed
prose
of
the
original
i
came
upon
something
which
went
very
much
as
follows
then
followed
the
dawn
of
day
and
the
princess
finished
her
allotted
say
praise
be
to
the
lord
of
light
alway
who
faileth
not
to
send
the
appointed
ray
and
so
on
at
much
greater
length
highly
ingenious
no
doubt
and
also
infinitely
foolish
i
remember
once
wasting
hours
nay
days
in
the
effort
to
render
rabelais
verses
written
over
the
great
gate
of
the
abbey
of
thelème
into
english
following
as
far
as
i
could
the
rhyme
system
now
according
to
the
french
notion
don
is
a
perfect
rhyme
to
pardon
and
so
rabelais
wrote
or
donné
par
don
ordonne
pardon
a
cil
qui
le
donne
et
bien
guerdonne
tout
mortel
preudhom
or
donné
par
don
that
is
the
final
sound
of
each
line
is
almost
identical
with
the
final
sound
of
every
other
line
and
of
this
i
made
for
given
relief
forgiven
and
lief
the
giver
believe
and
all
men
that
live
may
gain
the
palm
leaf
for
given
relief
soon
afterwards
while
i
was
resting
from
this
mighty
effort
i
read
in
disraeli
curiosities
of
literature
a
quotation
from
martial
turpe
est
difficiles
habere
nugas
is
folly
to
sweat
a
difficult
trifle
i
was
convinced
of
my
sin
i
suppose
that
the
real
translator
when
confronted
by
such
puzzles
contrives
to
think
of
an
indirect
rather
than
a
direct
solution
for
example
the
right
way
of
getting
the
effect
of
the
arabic
jingle
into
english
might
be
sought
by
the
path
of
alliteration
or
possibly
blank
verse
might
give
to
the
english
reader
something
of
the
same
kind
of
pleasure
as
that
enjoyed
by
the
oriental
in
reading
a
prose
which
infringes
on
the
region
of
poetry
and
it
may
be
that
the
queer
music
of
rabelais
could
be
echoed
at
least
in
english
by
the
use
of
assonance
here
is
indeed
a
diversion
but
it
has
arisen
legitimately
enough
from
that
shilling
paper
wrapper
volume
of
the
arabian
nights
bought
in
or
or
thereabouts
and
another
event
of
like
importance
was
my
seeing
de
quincey
confessions
of
an
english
opium
eater
at
pontypool
road
station
this
also
i
instantly
bought
and
as
instantly
loved
and
still
love
very
heartily
it
always
vexes
me
to
detect
as
i
constantly
do
detect
in
modern
critics
the
subtle
desire
to
run
down
de
quincey
the
critic
is
afraid
to
make
a
frontal
attack
the
stress
of
these
times
will
win
pardon
for
the
phrase
since
he
knows
that
he
will
be
opposed
by
such
splendours
and
such
terrors
an
army
with
banners
as
the
english
language
can
scarce
show
elsewhere
he
is
quite
aware
since
he
is
ex
hypothesi
an
able
critic
that
de
quincey
deliberately
used
our
tongue
as
if
it
had
been
a
mighty
organ
in
mightier
cathedral
so
that
the
very
stones
and
the
vault
and
the
hollow
spaces
of
the
towers
and
reverberate
and
thrill
with
tremendous
fugal
harmonies
and
our
critics
are
advised
also
that
de
quincey
was
no
mere
player
of
clever
tricks
with
the
language
his
was
not
the
amusing
stevensonian
method
of
counting
the
l
and
estimating
the
value
of
medial
s
and
the
terrifying
effect
of
the
final
reiterated
there
was
none
of
this
he
wrote
in
the
great
manner
because
he
thought
in
the
great
manner
the
critic
can
not
deny
this
he
must
admit
the
beauty
and
pathos
of
the
ann
episode
and
of
the
vision
of
jerusalem
but
still
he
will
hint
a
fault
and
hesitate
his
dislike
of
this
greater
master
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
all
realism
is
unpopular
and
de
quincey
was
eminently
a
realist
now
i
know
that
i
am
touching
here
on
a
great
question
i
hope
to
debate
it
at
length
later
on
for
the
moment
i
would
merely
say
that
i
define
realism
as
the
depicting
of
eternal
inner
realities
the
things
that
really
are
of
plato
as
opposed
to
the
description
of
transitory
external
surfaces
the
delusory
masks
and
dominoes
with
which
the
human
heart
drapes
and
hides
itself
but
all
this
apart
i
can
not
help
dwelling
on
the
manner
in
which
i
associate
these
early
literary
discoveries
of
mine
with
the
places
where
they
were
made
you
may
hear
friends
and
lovers
discussing
after
many
years
the
manner
of
their
first
meeting
daphnis
as
darby
will
remind
chloe
now
joan
how
they
saw
one
another
for
the
first
time
at
the
and
one
plate
of
their
bread
and
butter
tasted
slightly
of
onions
and
the
curate
achieved
six
faults
running
at
and
it
came
on
to
rain
so
i
can
never
take
up
de
quincey
without
thinking
of
the
dismal
platform
at
pontypool
road
and
the
joy
of
coming
home
for
the
holidays
and
the
mountains
all
about
me
as
i
stood
and
waited
for
my
father
and
the
trap
and
read
the
first
pages
of
the
magic
book
those
great
mountains
and
the
drive
home
by
the
green
arched
lanes
abounding
in
flowers
and
the
very
dear
look
of
home
amidst
its
orchards
all
these
are
part
and
parcel
of
my
joy
in
the
confessions
for
ever
and
so
again
with
another
noble
book
with
one
of
the
noblest
of
all
books
as
i
have
ever
esteemed
it
i
am
a
very
small
boy
about
seven
or
eight
years
old
i
conceive
and
my
mother
takes
me
with
her
to
pay
a
call
on
gwyn
of
llanfrechfa
rectory
the
ladies
talk
and
i
seeking
quietly
for
something
to
entertain
me
light
in
a
low
bookcase
on
a
fat
dumpy
little
book
i
suspect
it
was
the
oddity
of
the
shape
the
extreme
squabness
of
the
volume
that
first
took
my
fancy
and
then
i
open
the
pages
and
i
have
never
really
closed
them
for
the
dumpy
book
was
a
translation
of
the
ingenious
gentleman
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
and
those
are
words
that
will
thrill
a
lettered
man
as
the
opening
notes
of
certain
fugues
of
bach
will
thrill
a
musician
i
heard
nothing
of
the
amiable
talk
of
the
ladies
i
was
deep
in
the
small
print
alas
it
would
now
blind
my
tired
eyes
and
when
my
mother
rose
to
go
i
clung
so
desperately
and
piteously
to
the
fat
little
book
that
the
kind
gwyn
said
she
would
lend
it
to
me
and
i
might
take
it
home
for
which
benevolence
i
am
ever
bound
to
pray
for
her
good
estate
or
for
her
soul
as
it
may
chance
to
be
so
as
hereford
station
spells
for
me
principally
the
arabian
nights
as
de
quincey
is
linked
with
domed
mountains
and
green
lanes
and
the
return
home
the
ingenious
gentleman
advanced
to
greet
me
mysteriously
enough
in
the
of
the
rectory
of
llanfrechfa
and
i
shall
always
reckon
frechfa
the
freckled
as
among
the
most
venerated
of
the
celtic
saints
for
a
long
time
as
it
seems
to
me
i
have
been
talking
of
discoveries
of
books
discoveries
in
our
own
llanddewi
shelves
in
the
shelves
of
neighbours
on
railway
bookstalls
we
shall
hear
more
of
books
by
and
by
of
books
found
in
very
different
places
clare
market
and
the
strand
of
and
back
streets
by
notting
hill
gate
are
even
now
looming
before
us
so
for
the
present
we
may
hear
more
of
the
conditions
of
that
gwent
where
i
was
a
boy
and
a
young
man
i
have
said
that
i
was
born
just
a
little
too
late
to
witness
the
passing
of
the
gentry
few
of
them
survived
into
my
day
and
i
was
too
young
to
see
with
intelligence
that
which
still
remained
to
be
seen
of
the
old
order
but
one
thing
i
do
remember
that
the
gentry
of
those
times
even
when
they
were
wealthy
lived
with
a
simplicity
that
would
astonish
the
people
of
those
who
know
martin
chuzzlewit
will
remember
how
tigg
montague
who
was
montague
tigg
lunched
luxuriously
in
the
board
room
of
his
city
office
the
meal
was
brought
in
on
a
tray
and
consisted
of
a
pair
of
cold
roast
fowls
flanked
by
some
potted
meats
and
a
cool
salad
there
was
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
a
bottle
of
madeira
this
was
the
luncheon
of
vulgar
and
ostentatious
luxury
in
the
compare
it
with
the
kind
of
midday
meal
that
the
modern
montague
would
eat
at
the
hôtel
splendide
or
the
hôtel
glorieux
the
meal
of
the
man
who
eats
and
drinks
as
much
to
impress
others
with
his
wealth
as
to
gratify
his
own
appetite
well
i
have
often
seen
the
old
lord
tredegar
eating
his
luncheon
my
father
and
i
would
be
in
the
of
the
king
head
newport
waiting
for
the
ostler
to
put
in
the
pony
and
there
in
one
of
the
boxes
sat
the
old
lord
a
very
wealthy
man
eating
his
luncheon
which
was
bread
and
cheese
and
a
tankard
of
ale
and
oddly
enough
on
the
one
occasion
on
which
i
visited
the
ham
the
magnate
thereof
iltyd
nicholl
was
enjoying
a
meal
similar
in
every
respect
to
that
of
lord
tredegar
though
i
believe
he
had
a
little
cold
apple
tart
after
his
cheese
we
of
the
middle
people
always
dined
at
one
on
meat
pudding
and
cheese
tea
followed
at
five
an
affair
of
bread
and
butter
and
jam
with
possibly
a
caraway
loaf
hot
buttered
toast
was
distinctly
festal
the
day
closed
so
far
as
meals
were
concerned
with
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
at
nine
on
rare
occasions
once
in
three
years
or
so
a
number
of
clergy
who
called
themselves
collectively
the
ruridecanal
chapter
came
to
hear
a
paper
read
and
also
to
a
dinner
this
would
probably
consist
of
a
salmon
of
severn
or
usk
which
muddy
waters
breed
incomparably
the
finest
salmon
in
the
world
of
a
saddle
of
welsh
mutton
from
the
mountains
and
of
a
rich
sweet
called
very
lightly
and
unworthily
a
trifle
there
would
be
a
dessert
of
almonds
and
raisins
and
according
to
the
season
apples
and
pears
or
greengages
these
delicates
would
be
displayed
on
a
service
which
showed
green
in
relief
against
a
buff
ground
bordered
with
deep
purple
and
gold
it
was
hideous
and
i
should
think
spode
in
the
autumn
my
mother
used
to
concoct
a
singular
dish
which
she
called
fermety
it
is
more
generally
known
as
frumenty
you
will
find
it
mentioned
in
washington
irving
christmas
where
the
squire
makes
his
supper
off
it
on
christmas
eve
no
doubt
because
it
was
the
traditional
fasting
dish
for
the
vigil
of
the
nativity
it
was
made
so
far
as
i
can
remember
of
the
new
wheat
of
the
year
of
milk
of
eggs
of
currants
of
raisins
of
sugar
and
of
spices
all
working
up
together
in
one
delicious
gravy
no
doubt
a
very
honourable
dish
and
a
most
ancient
and
christian
pottage
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
should
like
it
if
it
were
proffered
to
me
now
among
the
farmers
a
few
of
the
elder
people
still
breakfasted
on
a
broth
made
of
fat
bacon
and
vegetables
and
decorated
oddly
enough
with
marigold
blossoms
and
a
fine
old
man
whom
i
once
met
in
a
lane
spoke
violently
against
tea
as
a
corrupting
thing
and
a
very
vain
novelty
for
women
he
said
it
might
serve
but
the
breakfast
for
a
man
was
a
quart
of
cider
with
a
toast
but
most
of
the
farming
people
breakfasted
on
rashers
of
bacon
cooked
by
being
hung
on
hooks
before
the
fire
in
a
dutch
oven
with
the
bacon
they
ate
potatoes
which
were
done
in
a
very
savoury
manner
take
cold
boiled
potatoes
break
into
small
pieces
fry
or
rather
in
bacon
fat
then
press
into
a
shallow
dish
pat
to
a
smooth
surface
and
brown
before
the
fire
this
is
a
breakfast
that
goes
very
well
with
a
keen
mountain
breath
of
a
morning
and
i
believe
that
cheese
always
formed
part
of
the
farmers
breakfast
as
a
kind
of
second
or
cold
course
this
was
of
their
own
making
and
was
of
the
kind
called
after
caerphilly
a
little
town
with
a
huge
ruinous
castle
in
a
hollow
of
giant
hills
it
is
a
white
cheese
of
a
creamy
consistency
and
delicate
flavour
and
is
to
be
commended
for
the
making
of
welsh
rarebit
the
farmers
as
i
say
ate
it
at
breakfast
again
at
twelve
dinner
after
hot
boiled
fat
bacon
and
beans
or
cabbage
and
again
at
tea
where
to
their
tastes
it
seemed
to
go
very
well
with
bread
and
butter
i
find
it
hard
to
realise
in
london
that
bread
and
butter
can
be
a
choice
delicacy
and
a
sweet
such
as
an
raspberry
tart
and
of
course
the
caerphilly
cheese
appeared
again
at
supper
and
with
bread
and
onions
it
was
always
the
hedgerow
snack
of
the
man
in
the
fields
and
the
cider
of
that
land
was
good
it
was
a
greenish
yellow
in
colour
with
a
glint
of
gold
in
it
if
held
up
to
the
light
as
it
were
a
remembrance
of
the
august
and
september
suns
that
had
shone
mellow
on
the
deep
orchards
of
gwent
it
was
of
full
body
and
flavour
and
strength
smooth
on
the
palate
neither
sweet
nor
sharp
and
i
do
not
think
there
was
anyone
in
llanddewi
parish
so
poor
as
not
to
have
a
barrel
or
two
in
his
cellar
against
christmastide
and
snowy
nights
though
to
be
sure
in
years
wherein
apples
were
a
scanty
crop
some
of
the
smaller
folk
increased
the
bulk
of
their
cider
by
strange
expedients
pears
went
to
the
mill
always
and
as
a
matter
of
course
in
most
of
the
orchards
there
were
one
or
two
big
pear
trees
and
possibly
the
wisdom
of
the
gwentian
ancients
had
concluded
that
a
slight
admixture
of
pears
with
the
apples
improved
and
mellowed
the
cider
but
in
scanty
years
when
the
man
with
but
a
few
trees
saw
bare
boughs
in
autumn
he
went
to
his
garden
dug
up
a
barrow
load
or
two
of
parsnips
and
added
them
to
his
apples
i
can
not
say
anything
as
to
the
resultant
juice
since
i
never
tasted
it
there
was
no
wretched
poverty
in
llanddewi
because
almost
everybody
had
a
little
land
of
his
own
tenant
farmers
there
were
of
course
who
held
of
john
hanbury
of
pontypool
park
lord
of
the
manor
of
edlogan
a
manor
named
after
a
certain
edlogion
who
was
a
prince
of
the
sixth
century
and
the
protector
of
cybi
sant
but
besides
his
tenants
and
those
of
other
landlords
there
was
a
numerous
race
of
small
freeholders
who
owned
eighty
fifty
ten
acres
of
land
and
so
down
till
you
came
to
a
holding
of
a
house
and
a
garden
and
a
mere
patch
by
the
roadside
but
with
a
garden
and
a
patch
of
land
a
clever
cottager
of
the
old
school
could
do
a
great
deal
i
remember
an
old
man
named
timothy
who
lived
in
a
house
very
small
and
very
ancient
in
the
midst
of
the
fields
far
even
from
a
and
he
thought
in
greengages
as
a
stock
exchange
man
thinks
in
shares
for
about
his
old
cottage
there
were
three
or
four
or
maybe
half
a
dozen
greengage
trees
that
had
been
planted
so
long
ago
that
they
had
grown
almost
to
the
dignity
of
timber
and
spread
wild
branches
high
and
low
and
far
and
wide
so
that
one
might
say
that
old
timothy
lived
in
a
grove
or
wood
of
greengage
trees
so
you
may
conceive
how
deeply
the
poor
old
man
thought
of
these
gages
beside
which
his
little
orchard
of
damsons
and
bullaces
was
of
small
account
a
really
plentiful
crop
when
the
big
boughs
were
heavy
and
drooping
with
rich
green
fruit
meant
to
him
abundance
and
luxury
and
bare
trees
spelt
on
the
other
hand
a
bare
winter
and
some
pinching
of
poverty
though
nothing
beyond
endurance
timothy
was
a
smallholder
on
the
smallest
scale
but
there
were
many
people
of
two
six
or
twelve
acres
who
did
very
well
in
their
humble
way
which
i
have
always
thought
is
the
happy
way
if
one
can
attain
to
it
the
man
would
work
for
a
farmer
in
the
and
often
be
sturdy
enough
to
do
many
things
on
his
own
estate
on
summer
evenings
and
all
the
day
long
his
wife
was
busy
with
her
pigs
and
bees
and
fowls
and
perhaps
with
two
or
three
cows
there
was
a
good
market
for
their
produce
at
pontypool
a
town
on
the
verge
of
the
industrial
district
for
the
colliers
and
the
tinplate
workers
love
to
feed
richly
i
once
saw
a
woman
putting
the
last
touches
to
a
flat
apple
tart
in
a
little
tavern
called
castle
on
the
mountain
side
she
drew
out
the
tart
from
the
oven
prised
open
the
lid
of
pastry
and
inserted
some
of
butter
and
half
pound
of
moist
demerara
sugar
and
then
put
back
the
lid
and
replaced
the
pastry
in
the
oven
so
that
apple
juice
sugar
butter
should
fuse
all
together
that
is
a
fair
sample
of
hill
cookery
other
people
of
the
hills
would
buy
fresh
butter
at
a
high
price
and
give
what
they
were
asked
for
green
caerphilly
cheese
still
melting
from
the
press
and
they
loved
to
plaster
butter
heavily
on
hot
new
bread
and
then
crown
all
with
an
equal
depth
of
golden
honey
and
they
had
a
goodly
appetite
also
for
great
fat
salmon
caught
in
the
yellow
usk
water
and
so
the
fishermen
of
caerleon
and
the
little
farmers
of
such
parishes
as
llanddewi
profited
hugely
by
these
mountain
tastes
many
years
afterwards
i
lived
for
a
short
while
on
the
chiltern
hills
here
was
a
different
tale
in
a
whole
parish
there
was
i
think
barely
a
single
small
holder
the
little
properties
had
all
been
bought
up
by
the
great
landlords
there
was
no
comfort
about
the
tumbledown
leaky
cottages
which
in
many
cases
depended
for
their
drinking
water
supply
on
dirty
none
of
the
farm
labourers
had
fowls
or
pigs
or
bees
the
farmers
their
employers
did
not
allow
the
men
to
keep
pigs
or
fowls
lest
they
should
be
tempted
to
steal
corn
and
meal
so
the
poorer
folk
were
divided
into
two
classes
the
wastrels
who
went
on
the
parish
at
the
slightest
provocation
and
without
the
slightest
shame
and
a
few
more
prosperous
sour
boors
who
were
consumed
with
an
acrid
liberalism
and
with
a
rancorous
envy
of
anyone
better
off
than
themselves
but
at
llanddewi
the
small
holder
of
land
so
far
from
envying
or
hating
the
great
landlord
took
as
it
were
a
pride
in
him
i
remember
owen
tudor
owner
of
nine
or
ten
rough
acres
of
wild
land
in
llanddewi
being
both
grieved
and
angry
when
she
heard
that
a
great
and
ancient
gwentian
house
might
be
forced
to
sell
a
certain
portion
of
their
estates
through
the
pressure
of
bad
times
in
the
early
she
too
was
a
landowner
of
rushes
chiefly
and
alder
copses
and
bracken
and
of
ancient
though
unblazoned
family
and
if
the
great
morgans
suffered
so
also
did
she
suffer
it
comes
to
my
mind
that
i
must
by
no
means
forget
sir
walter
scott
and
all
that
he
did
for
me
and
to
get
at
him
it
is
necessary
that
we
enter
the
at
llanddewi
i
was
amused
the
other
day
to
see
in
an
old
curiosity
shop
near
lincoln
inn
fields
amongst
the
rarities
displayed
small
china
jars
or
pots
with
a
picture
of
two
salmon
against
a
background
of
leafage
on
the
lid
i
remember
eating
potted
salmon
out
of
just
such
jars
as
these
and
now
even
in
my
lifetime
they
appear
to
have
become
curious
so
perhaps
if
i
describe
a
room
which
was
furnished
in
that
also
may
be
found
to
be
curious
i
may
note
by
the
way
that
we
always
applied
the
word
parlour
which
properly
means
and
is
still
i
think
used
in
that
sense
in
the
united
states
of
america
to
the
which
was
also
our
living
room
for
general
everyday
use
so
sir
walter
scott
speaks
of
a
and
pecksniff
entering
todgers
of
the
and
now
the
word
only
occurs
in
in
the
phrase
parlour
prices
and
even
that
use
is
becoming
obsolete
but
as
for
the
llanddewi
the
walls
were
covered
with
a
white
paper
on
which
was
repeated
at
regular
intervals
a
design
in
pale
yellowish
buff
the
carpet
was
also
white
on
it
also
at
regular
intervals
were
bunches
of
very
red
roses
and
very
green
leaves
in
the
exact
centre
of
the
room
was
a
round
rosewood
table
standing
on
one
leg
and
consequently
shaky
this
was
covered
with
a
vivid
green
cloth
trimmed
with
a
bright
yellow
border
in
the
centre
of
the
cloth
was
a
round
mat
apparently
made
of
scarlet
and
white
tags
or
lengths
of
wool
this
supported
the
lamp
of
state
it
was
of
white
china
and
of
alabastrous
appearance
and
it
burned
colza
oil
one
had
to
wind
it
up
at
intervals
as
if
it
had
been
a
clock
in
the
before
the
coming
of
paraffin
we
usually
burned
composite
candles
two
when
we
were
by
ourselves
four
when
there
was
company
over
the
mantelpiece
stood
a
large
high
mirror
in
a
florid
gilt
frame
before
it
were
two
vases
of
with
alternate
facets
of
dull
white
and
opaque
green
of
a
green
so
evil
and
so
bilious
and
so
hideous
that
i
marvel
how
the
human
mind
can
have
conceived
it
and
yet
my
heart
aches
too
when
as
rarely
happens
i
see
in
rubbish
shops
in
london
back
streets
vases
of
like
design
and
colour
somewhere
in
the
room
was
a
smaller
vase
of
bohemian
glass
its
designs
in
ground
glass
against
translucent
ruby
this
vase
i
think
must
have
stood
on
the
whatnot
a
triangular
pyramidal
piece
of
furniture
that
occupied
one
corner
and
consisted
of
shelves
getting
smaller
and
smaller
as
they
got
higher
against
one
wall
stood
a
cabinet
of
inlaid
wood
velvet
lined
with
glass
doors
on
the
shelves
were
kept
certain
pieces
of
nantgarw
china
some
old
with
high
stems
and
a
collection
of
silver
and
and
two
stoneware
jugs
the
pictures
white
mounts
and
gilt
frames
were
and
against
one
of
the
hung
a
painting
on
glass
depicting
a
bouquet
of
flowers
in
an
alabaster
jar
there
was
a
plaster
cast
in
a
round
black
frame
which
i
connect
in
my
mind
with
the
crystal
palace
and
the
prince
consort
and
an
art
union
whatever
that
may
be
it
displayed
a
very
fat
little
girl
curled
up
apparently
amidst
wheat
sheaves
a
long
stool
in
stood
on
the
hearthrug
before
the
fire
and
a
also
in
bead
work
shaped
like
a
banner
was
suspended
on
a
brass
stand
on
a
bracket
in
one
corner
was
the
marble
bust
of
lesbia
and
her
sparrow
beneath
it
in
a
hanging
bookcase
the
waverley
novels
a
brown
row
of
golden
books
i
can
see
myself
now
curled
up
in
all
odd
corners
of
the
rectory
reading
waverley
ivanhoe
rob
roy
guy
mannering
old
mortality
and
the
rest
of
them
curled
up
and
entranced
so
that
i
was
deaf
and
gave
no
answer
when
they
called
to
me
and
had
to
be
roused
to
life
which
meant
tea
with
a
loud
and
repeated
summons
but
what
can
they
say
who
have
been
in
fairyland
notoriously
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
true
report
of
its
ineffable
marvels
and
delights
happiness
said
de
quincey
on
his
discovery
of
the
paradise
that
he
thought
he
had
found
in
opium
could
be
sent
down
by
the
more
truly
i
could
announce
my
discovery
that
delight
could
be
contained
in
small
octavos
and
small
type
in
a
bookshelf
three
feet
long
i
took
sir
walter
to
my
heart
with
great
joy
and
roamed
enraptured
through
his
library
of
adventures
and
marvels
as
i
roamed
through
the
lanes
and
hollows
continually
confronted
by
new
enchantments
and
fresh
pleasures
perhaps
i
remember
most
acutely
my
first
reading
of
the
heart
of
midlothian
and
this
for
a
good
but
external
reason
i
was
suffering
from
the
toothache
of
my
life
while
i
was
reading
it
from
a
toothache
that
lasted
for
a
week
and
left
me
in
a
sort
of
low
fever
as
we
called
it
then
and
i
remember
very
well
as
i
sat
wretched
and
yet
rapturous
by
the
fire
with
a
warm
shawl
about
my
face
my
father
saying
with
a
grim
chuckle
that
i
would
never
forget
my
first
reading
of
the
heart
of
midlothian
i
never
have
forgotten
it
and
i
have
never
forgotten
that
sir
walter
scott
tales
with
every
deduction
for
their
numerous
and
sometimes
glaring
faults
have
the
root
of
the
matter
in
them
they
are
vital
literature
they
are
of
the
heart
of
true
romance
what
is
vital
literature
what
is
true
romance
those
are
difficult
questions
which
i
once
tried
to
answer
according
to
my
lights
in
a
book
called
hieroglyphics
here
i
will
merely
say
that
vital
literature
is
something
as
remote
as
you
can
possibly
imagine
from
the
short
stories
of
the
late
guy
de
maupassant
the
hanging
bookcase
in
the
under
the
marble
bust
of
lesbia
and
her
sparrow
is
not
only
rich
and
golden
in
my
memory
from
its
being
the
habitation
of
the
waverley
novels
this
had
been
treasure
enough
indeed
to
make
the
shelves
for
ever
dear
but
there
was
more
than
this
the
bookcase
held
besides
sir
walter
romances
my
father
school
and
college
prizes
dignified
books
in
whole
calf
and
in
pigskin
adorned
with
the
arms
of
cowbridge
school
and
jesus
college
oxford
in
rich
gold
here
was
the
judicious
hooker
whose
judiciousness
i
regret
to
say
i
could
never
abide
nor
stomach
here
that
noble
book
glossary
of
gothic
architecture
in
three
volumes
one
of
text
and
two
of
beautifully
executed
plates
and
here
was
an
early
volume
of
tennyson
of
these
two
books
i
can
scarcely
say
which
is
the
more
precious
and
eminent
in
my
recollection
the
one
stands
for
my
initiation
into
the
spirit
of
gothic
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
most
magical
of
all
initiations
more
furious
and
frantic
nonsense
has
been
talked
about
paganism
than
about
almost
any
other
subject
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
think
of
swinburne
with
his
world
has
grown
grey
phrase
to
indicate
what
manner
of
nonsense
i
have
in
mind
but
the
fact
is
that
the
heart
of
paganism
was
not
exactly
contrite
or
broken
but
certainly
resigned
with
an
austere
and
stoical
acceptance
of
fate
which
is
not
without
its
beauty
and
its
majesty
the
nearest
modern
equivalent
to
the
classic
or
pagan
spirit
is
calvinism
the
oedipus
tyrannus
is
nothing
but
the
doctrine
of
predestination
set
to
solemn
music
and
this
austere
spirit
stamped
itself
on
all
the
finest
greek
art
it
is
somewhat
softened
in
plato
for
plato
drew
from
the
east
by
way
of
pythagoras
but
the
beauty
of
greek
tragedy
architecture
sculpture
is
essentially
austere
and
severe
it
is
calvinism
in
marble
and
judgment
and
inexorable
vengeance
on
guilty
sinners
are
sung
in
choral
odes
now
winter
has
its
splendours
but
with
what
joy
do
we
welcome
the
yearly
miracle
of
spring
we
and
the
whole
earth
exult
together
as
though
we
had
been
delivered
from
prison
the
hedgerows
and
the
fields
are
glad
and
the
woods
are
filled
with
singing
and
men
hearts
are
filled
with
an
ineffable
rapture
israel
once
more
has
come
out
of
egypt
from
the
house
of
bondage
and
all
this
is
expressed
in
the
gothic
and
much
more
than
this
it
is
the
art
of
the
supreme
exaltation
of
the
inebriation
of
the
body
and
soul
and
spirit
of
man
it
is
not
resigned
to
dwell
calmly
stoically
austerely
on
the
level
plains
of
this
earthly
life
since
its
joy
is
in
this
that
it
has
stormed
the
battlements
of
heaven
and
so
its
vaults
and
its
spires
rush
upward
and
its
pinnacles
are
like
a
wood
of
springing
trees
and
its
hard
stones
its
pillars
break
out
as
it
were
into
song
they
blossom
as
the
rose
all
the
secrets
of
the
garden
and
the
field
and
the
wood
have
been
delivered
unto
them
and
not
only
is
all
this
true
of
building
take
a
common
iron
nail
that
is
to
be
driven
into
a
door
the
gothic
smith
would
so
deal
with
that
nail
that
its
head
should
become
a
little
piece
of
joy
and
fantasy
a
little
portion
of
paradise
nay
take
the
letter
a
as
the
romans
gave
it
to
us
a
plain
letter
admirably
fulfilling
its
purpose
with
no
nonsense
about
it
now
look
at
a
illuminated
manuscript
and
seek
out
this
a
it
has
every
kind
of
nonsense
about
it
of
that
nonsense
that
makes
earth
into
heaven
it
is
not
only
that
it
glows
with
rich
raised
gold
that
it
is
most
imperially
vested
in
blue
and
in
scarlet
but
its
frigid
form
has
relaxed
into
beauty
it
is
no
longer
a
mere
letter
it
is
as
a
wild
in
a
hedge
from
it
spring
curves
of
infinite
grace
which
enclose
the
page
of
text
and
branches
break
from
the
main
stem
and
blossom
out
into
flowers
of
paradise
so
the
wild
roses
delicate
enchanting
sway
and
quiver
over
the
green
field
in
the
month
of
june
so
much
for
the
glossary
now
for
the
other
volume
the
little
early
tennyson
my
attention
was
directed
to
this
in
an
odd
manner
one
of
the
masters
at
school
had
called
me
a
and
i
was
much
pleased
with
the
sound
of
the
phrase
though
the
master
did
not
mean
to
be
complimentary
and
i
had
no
notion
as
to
what
a
really
was
but
in
the
course
of
the
next
holidays
rummaging
at
random
among
the
books
at
the
rectory
as
my
custom
was
i
opened
the
tennyson
and
found
the
poem
of
the
with
the
choric
song
annexed
i
began
to
read
that
i
might
be
instructed
as
to
the
exact
nature
of
my
crime
i
read
on
enchanted
and
it
was
then
in
my
twelfth
or
thirteenth
year
that
i
first
delighted
in
poetry
as
poetry
for
its
own
sake
apart
from
any
story
it
might
tell
and
here
i
find
an
extraordinary
difficulty
in
making
a
distinction
as
the
casuists
say
between
two
very
different
kinds
of
literary
pleasure
for
some
time
i
had
enjoyed
great
literature
in
such
books
as
don
quixote
and
sir
walter
scott
romances
but
the
which
is
also
i
think
great
literature
gave
me
a
quite
new
and
peculiar
delight
hitherto
it
had
been
the
story
which
had
charmed
me
but
now
i
found
myself
delighting
in
the
music
and
melody
of
verse
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
poem
in
the
colour
of
the
words
to
use
terms
of
which
i
disapprove
but
for
which
i
can
find
no
efficient
substitutes
i
suspect
indeed
that
i
found
in
tennyson
poem
the
transmuted
and
golden
image
of
my
own
solitary
and
meditative
habit
of
mind
and
this
may
have
counted
for
something
in
the
sum
of
my
delight
the
master
a
cheery
excellent
young
man
as
i
remember
him
may
have
made
a
correct
diagnosis
i
had
been
a
for
years
without
knowing
it
and
so
recognised
ulysses
entranced
companions
as
my
true
comrades
in
dreams
it
may
have
been
so
but
in
any
case
i
have
always
dated
my
inoculation
with
the
specific
virus
of
literature
from
my
reading
of
those
verses
in
the
little
volume
some
years
ago
i
was
asked
by
the
editor
of
a
paper
to
write
a
short
series
of
articles
about
london
the
subject
seems
ambitious
enough
and
indeed
london
considered
either
physically
or
intellectually
is
so
vast
and
mighty
a
world
that
the
study
of
any
one
of
even
the
smallest
and
least
considerable
of
its
aspects
may
well
be
the
task
of
a
lifetime
but
so
far
as
i
can
remember
my
instructions
were
of
the
liberal
and
catholic
kind
i
mean
i
was
not
required
to
write
of
the
great
city
as
the
goal
of
the
timber
merchant
or
of
the
dealer
in
precious
stones
or
of
the
makers
of
chasubles
or
of
the
fashioner
of
wigs
but
rather
to
depict
it
as
the
end
sought
by
all
these
and
by
myriads
more
and
so
i
set
about
the
task
in
my
usual
spirit
firmly
convinced
that
is
that
better
men
had
said
all
that
there
was
to
say
on
the
matter
brought
before
me
and
yet
resolved
to
do
my
best
and
to
try
to
make
something
of
the
job
in
one
way
or
another
so
i
set
to
work
and
found
strangely
enough
that
though
i
was
writing
about
london
i
was
also
writing
a
mystical
treatise
on
a
text
which
i
will
not
divulge
in
this
place
but
for
the
beginning
of
my
series
i
remember
that
i
went
back
a
good
many
years
to
the
time
when
london
began
to
call
to
me
i
often
speculate
now
in
these
later
days
as
to
how
it
would
have
been
with
me
if
this
call
had
never
come
for
i
have
certain
friends
very
few
of
them
still
living
in
gwent
and
on
its
borders
who
have
not
heard
the
summons
the
special
family
that
i
have
in
mind
has
lived
in
those
regions
for
more
centuries
than
i
can
tell
it
would
be
a
bold
and
learned
welsh
herald
who
would
trace
them
to
their
beginnings
on
the
celtic
side
but
on
the
norman
they
go
back
to
sir
payne
turberville
the
companion
of
fitzhamon
and
even
in
wales
a
story
of
nine
hundred
years
is
a
long
story
well
coming
down
a
little
through
the
ages
the
rowlands
that
i
knew
of
course
their
grandfather
knew
my
grandfather
are
still
on
the
soil
certainly
a
younger
son
has
crossed
the
severn
but
the
two
others
have
not
moved
their
habitations
more
than
ten
or
twelve
miles
in
the
last
fifty
years
from
between
newport
and
cardiff
to
newport
from
newport
to
a
mile
east
of
newport
then
to
four
miles
east
of
newport
at
last
to
three
miles
west
of
cardiff
they
will
surely
be
laid
in
the
land
of
their
fathers
at
the
end
so
it
might
have
been
with
me
perhaps
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
blood
of
certain
scottish
sailors
intermingled
with
the
stock
of
gwent
but
i
often
wonder
as
i
say
how
it
would
have
happened
to
me
if
i
had
found
a
home
under
the
shadow
of
twyn
barlwm
instead
of
becoming
a
dweller
in
the
tents
of
london
tents
i
say
advisedly
for
with
the
rarest
exceptions
londoners
have
no
homes
this
was
true
in
a
great
measure
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
when
johnson
first
came
to
london
from
lichfield
it
is
now
all
but
universally
true
but
anyhow
the
call
of
london
partly
external
and
partly
internal
came
to
me
and
for
some
months
before
i
left
the
old
land
for
the
first
time
i
was
imagining
london
and
making
a
picture
of
it
in
my
mind
and
longing
for
it
i
turned
up
the
old
magazines
and
sala
twice
round
the
clock
i
came
upon
the
strange
phrase
the
city
in
stories
and
wondered
what
the
city
signified
and
i
began
to
have
an
appetite
for
london
papers
for
it
should
be
understood
that
at
llanddewi
rectory
a
london
paper
was
a
thing
of
the
rarest
appearance
i
think
i
can
remember
that
when
the
prince
of
wales
afterwards
king
edward
vii
of
happy
memory
was
dangerously
ill
my
father
made
some
kind
of
arrangement
i
can
not
think
what
it
could
have
been
by
which
he
got
the
echo
of
those
days
not
only
on
week
days
but
on
sunday
afternoons
and
in
ordinary
times
when
we
went
into
newport
on
market
days
we
might
possibly
bring
back
a
standard
or
a
telegraph
but
likely
enough
not
we
saw
the
western
mail
occasionally
the
hereford
times
once
a
week
weekly
also
came
the
guardian
an
excellent
paper
but
with
more
of
oxford
pater
and
freeman
and
deans
and
dignitaries
in
it
than
of
london
or
londoners
indeed
i
remember
how
the
news
of
the
fall
of
khartoum
came
to
the
rectory
i
had
been
spending
the
evening
with
some
friends
across
a
few
miles
of
midnight
and
black
copse
and
ragged
field
and
wild
broken
and
wandering
brook
land
and
i
remember
that
not
a
star
was
to
be
seen
as
i
came
home
wondering
all
the
while
if
i
ever
should
find
my
way
one
of
my
friends
had
been
in
newport
that
day
and
had
seen
a
paper
and
so
when
i
got
back
at
last
and
found
my
father
smoking
his
pipe
by
the
fire
i
announced
the
news
in
a
tag
of
apocalyptic
greek
khartoum
he
polis
he
megale
peptoke
peptoke
khartoum
the
mighty
city
has
fallen
has
fallen
and
sometimes
i
wonder
now
in
these
days
when
i
am
nearer
to
the
heart
of
newspapers
whether
our
work
in
fleet
street
with
its
anxious
flurried
yell
over
the
telephone
its
of
tapes
its
slither
and
rattle
and
clatter
of
linotypes
its
frantic
haste
of
men
its
final
roar
and
thunder
of
machinery
ever
gets
itself
delivered
at
last
on
a
midnight
hillside
so
queerly
as
the
tragic
news
of
khartoum
was
delivered
in
the
parlour
of
llanddewi
rectory
but
the
days
came
when
above
the
clear
voice
of
the
brook
in
the
hidden
valley
above
the
murmur
of
the
trees
in
the
heart
of
the
greenwood
there
sounded
from
beyond
the
hills
to
my
heart
a
clearer
voice
a
mightier
murmur
london
called
me
and
all
documents
relating
to
this
new
unknown
world
became
matters
of
the
highest
consequence
and
significance
and
so
london
papers
must
by
all
means
be
obtained
far
and
long
ago
that
spring
and
summer
of
now
seem
to
me
it
was
then
that
london
began
to
summon
and
i
was
filled
with
an
eager
curiosity
to
know
all
about
the
new
world
which
i
was
to
visit
as
i
have
explained
the
london
paper
made
a
very
rare
and
occasional
appearance
at
and
i
do
think
that
any
of
us
felt
any
aching
need
of
it
but
now
for
me
standard
and
telegraph
became
mystic
documents
of
the
highest
interest
and
most
vital
consequence
these
were
the
charts
to
the
nova
terra
incognita
every
line
in
them
came
from
the
heart
of
the
mystery
and
was
written
by
men
who
were
learned
in
all
the
wisdom
of
london
london
papers
i
must
have
that
was
certain
so
i
set
out
to
get
them
the
nearest
point
at
which
these
precious
rarities
were
obtainable
was
pontypool
road
station
about
four
miles
distant
from
llanddewi
rectory
it
was
the
place
where
i
had
bought
my
copy
of
de
quincey
some
years
earlier
and
is
now
sacred
to
me
on
that
account
but
in
this
month
of
april
years
ago
i
thought
little
of
de
quincey
or
of
his
visions
columbus
i
suspect
while
he
watched
the
fitting
of
his
caravel
forgot
any
mere
literary
enthusiasms
that
he
might
have
once
possessed
for
him
there
was
but
one
object
and
that
was
the
tremendous
marvellous
terrible
venture
into
the
unknown
that
he
was
soon
to
make
so
it
was
with
me
london
loomed
up
before
me
wonderful
mystical
as
assyrian
babylon
as
full
of
things
and
great
unveilings
as
any
magic
city
in
an
eastern
tale
it
loomed
up
with
incredible
pinnacles
to
quote
tennyson
on
another
city
and
in
its
mighty
shadow
all
lesser
objects
disappeared
de
quincey
after
all
he
was
not
without
value
since
he
spoke
of
oxford
street
still
i
wanted
later
news
of
the
city
of
the
enchanters
so
three
or
four
times
a
week
i
walked
the
four
miles
to
pontypool
road
taking
the
short
cut
across
the
fields
which
leaves
the
at
croeswen
and
brings
one
out
on
the
high
road
from
newport
to
abergavenny
somewhere
about
a
mile
from
the
station
near
the
lane
which
wanders
through
a
very
solitary
country
into
usk
pontypool
road
station
lies
as
i
have
said
under
mountains
or
rather
under
the
huge
domed
hills
which
we
in
gwent
call
mountains
it
is
one
of
the
many
between
the
fields
and
the
works
and
is
always
associated
in
my
mind
with
a
noise
of
clanking
machinery
and
a
reek
of
black
oily
smoke
of
rich
flavour
which
this
generation
would
not
recognise
since
it
is
only
to
be
imitated
by
blowing
out
a
tallow
candle
that
has
long
wanted
snuffing
and
now
there
are
neither
tallow
candles
nor
snuffers
here
then
of
a
celestial
agent
of
smith
i
bought
my
papers
usually
the
standard
and
the
daily
telegraph
the
morning
post
was
i
think
twopence
in
those
days
and
twopence
was
too
much
to
give
for
a
daily
paper
and
moreover
we
had
a
vague
belief
that
the
morning
post
was
almost
exclusively
concerned
with
the
social
doings
of
the
aristocracy
splendid
matters
doubtless
but
no
affairs
of
mine
with
these
two
papers
then
and
once
a
week
with
a
copy
of
truth
i
would
make
my
way
out
of
the
station
and
along
the
high
road
till
i
came
to
the
stile
and
the
lonely
path
across
the
fields
and
alone
under
a
tree
or
in
the
shelter
of
a
friendly
hedge
i
would
open
my
papers
cut
their
pages
and
plunge
into
their
garden
of
delights
one
of
my
chief
interests
in
these
journals
perhaps
my
chiefest
interest
was
the
theatre
and
i
am
sure
i
can
not
say
why
this
was
so
as
far
as
i
can
remember
i
had
up
to
this
time
witnessed
three
performances
of
stage
plays
and
of
these
three
one
was
certainly
not
legitimate
being
a
drama
of
the
circus
called
dick
turpin
ride
to
york
its
chief
incidents
were
firing
pistols
and
leaping
over
gates
and
i
must
have
been
about
seven
when
i
saw
it
at
cardiff
then
in
i
was
at
dublin
and
saw
our
boys
and
was
very
heartily
bored
and
finally
in
or
i
went
with
a
to
the
at
hereford
i
remember
the
former
as
well
as
the
latter
rinking
mania
and
enjoyed
a
touring
company
rendering
of
pinafore
and
looking
back
i
believe
that
it
was
then
that
the
delightful
poison
began
to
work
then
when
in
that
ramshackle
barn
of
a
place
in
the
hereford
backstreet
the
curtain
went
up
on
the
saturday
afternoon
and
eight
men
dressed
as
sailors
began
to
sing
we
sail
the
ocean
blue
and
our
saucy
ship
a
beauty
we
gallant
men
and
true
and
attentive
to
our
duty
i
remember
that
young
as
i
was
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
eight
was
a
very
small
number
for
the
male
chorus
this
circumstance
confirms
me
in
a
belief
which
i
have
long
entertained
that
heaven
meant
me
to
be
a
true
i
could
never
master
simple
addition
and
a
has
to
keep
accounts
still
i
should
not
have
been
the
first
whose
ledgers
were
filled
with
comptes
fantastiques
but
here
i
am
under
my
tree
or
my
hedge
on
a
sunny
morning
of
that
gwentian
spring
of
so
many
years
ago
eagerly
opening
the
paper
and
turning
to
the
theatrical
advertisements
in
that
part
of
the
journal
which
i
have
in
later
years
learned
to
call
the
leader
page
i
read
about
henry
irving
at
the
lyceum
and
toole
at
the
folly
i
do
not
think
the
vanished
theatre
was
known
as
toole
in
those
days
mme
modjeska
and
were
i
believe
at
the
court
dion
boucicault
play
the
shaughraun
was
running
at
the
adelphi
or
stay
was
this
old
house
of
melodrama
then
the
home
of
the
danites
in
wych
street
at
the
opera
comique
was
the
pirates
of
penzance
madame
favart
enchanted
at
the
strand
les
cloches
de
corneville
was
at
the
globe
or
the
olympic
i
forget
which
and
said
each
advertisement
for
cast
see
under
the
clock
i
was
vividly
interested
in
that
phrase
for
cast
see
under
the
clock
which
i
read
in
the
sibylline
leaves
of
my
london
papers
the
real
meaning
of
the
words
never
occurred
to
me
i
conceived
that
somewhere
in
some
central
place
of
london
there
was
a
great
clock
on
a
high
square
tower
and
that
this
tower
was
so
prominent
an
architectural
feature
as
to
be
known
all
over
london
as
the
clock
and
at
the
base
of
this
tower
so
i
proceeded
in
my
fancy
there
were
displayed
bills
or
posters
containing
the
casts
of
all
the
plays
of
all
the
theatres
i
never
found
that
mighty
tower
in
london
but
it
was
many
years
before
it
dawned
on
me
that
the
clock
was
merely
the
pictured
in
the
newspaper
itself
under
which
the
full
casts
were
then
printed
as
i
have
said
i
can
not
quite
make
out
the
sources
of
this
intense
interest
of
mine
in
the
theatre
but
i
suspect
that
for
the
time
i
had
got
into
that
strange
frame
of
mind
to
which
thackeray
alluded
when
he
asked
a
man
if
he
were
fond
of
the
play
thackeray
friend
replied
i
think
to
the
effect
that
it
depended
on
the
play
whereupon
thackeray
told
him
that
he
did
understand
in
the
least
what
the
phrase
fond
of
the
play
implied
thackeray
was
right
for
this
attitude
of
mind
is
universal
not
particular
and
oddly
enough
i
believe
it
is
very
little
related
to
any
serious
interest
in
the
drama
as
a
form
of
art
there
is
so
vast
a
gulf
between
the
theatre
of
and
that
of
years
ago
that
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
now
possible
for
anybody
to
be
fond
of
the
play
in
the
old
sense
but
if
there
be
such
people
left
i
am
sure
that
they
have
not
the
faintest
interest
in
the
proposals
to
build
and
endow
a
national
theatre
for
to
those
in
the
happy
state
to
which
thackeray
alluded
the
theatre
was
loved
not
for
itself
but
as
a
symbol
of
gaiety
i
would
almost
say
of
metropolitanism
as
opposed
to
provincialism
i
have
known
countrymen
relating
their
adventures
in
london
almost
to
wink
as
they
included
a
visit
to
the
globe
or
the
strand
in
the
list
of
their
pleasures
the
theatre
represented
to
them
the
chimes
at
midnight
mood
thackeray
meant
do
you
like
the
mingled
gas
and
orange
odours
of
the
theatre
do
you
like
the
sound
of
the
orchestra
tuning
the
sight
of
the
footlights
suddenly
lightening
can
you
project
your
self
readily
into
the
fantastic
world
disclosed
by
the
rising
curtain
and
afterwards
do
you
like
a
midnight
chop
at
evans
with
welsh
rarebit
to
follow
and
foaming
tankards
of
brown
stout
and
then
something
hot
in
fine
do
you
like
to
be
out
and
about
and
in
the
midst
of
gaiety
at
hours
of
the
night
when
your
uncles
and
aunts
and
all
quiet
country
people
are
abed
and
fast
asleep
that
is
what
thackeray
meant
by
his
question
and
i
suppose
that
our
modern
serious
lovers
of
the
drama
would
regard
the
man
who
was
fond
of
the
play
in
this
sense
as
an
utter
reprobate
a
and
a
stone
of
offence
but
it
was
in
that
sense
that
i
pored
devoutly
over
everything
relating
to
the
theatre
that
i
found
in
my
newspapers
as
i
delayed
in
my
walks
home
from
pontypool
road
not
being
able
to
refrain
any
longer
well
the
day
dawned
at
last
for
dreams
to
come
true
or
as
true
as
they
ever
come
my
father
and
i
set
out
one
fine
monday
morning
for
paddington
starting
i
think
at
about
eleven
from
newport
and
getting
to
london
by
five
in
the
afternoon
this
was
then
the
best
train
in
the
day
for
the
severn
tunnel
was
not
yet
made
and
we
went
all
the
way
round
by
gloucester
it
was
a
six
hours
journey
and
now
one
can
get
from
london
to
newport
in
two
hours
and
a
half
at
westbourne
park
we
changed
and
got
into
the
underground
system
and
so
came
to
the
temple
station
on
the
embankment
thence
it
was
a
short
walk
to
the
private
hotel
in
surrey
street
where
my
father
had
always
stayed
on
his
infrequent
visits
to
town
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
hotel
bradshaw
office
is
built
on
the
site
of
it
it
was
williams
or
smith
or
evans
or
some
such
title
and
as
i
believe
was
then
the
way
it
was
understood
to
be
more
or
less
the
preserve
of
people
from
the
west
i
suppose
there
were
other
little
hotels
for
parsons
and
small
squires
of
the
east
and
north
and
south
for
all
the
streets
that
go
down
from
the
strand
to
the
river
were
then
occupied
by
these
private
hotels
and
by
craven
street
by
charing
cross
is
the
only
one
of
these
streets
that
has
at
all
preserved
the
old
manner
which
let
me
say
was
a
dingy
and
dim
but
on
the
whole
a
comfortable
manner
our
hotel
was
just
opposite
the
pit
door
of
the
old
strand
theatre
and
in
a
former
visit
my
father
and
mother
sitting
at
their
window
had
had
the
gratification
of
seeing
swanborough
sitting
at
her
window
over
the
way
knitting
busily
now
all
our
ladies
however
smart
have
become
knitters
but
if
i
had
been
writing
these
reminiscences
a
few
years
ago
i
should
have
asked
can
you
imagine
a
london
manageress
of
these
days
sitting
and
knitting
in
her
room
at
the
theatre
we
went
out
for
a
short
stroll
before
eating
and
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
strand
and
it
instantly
went
to
my
head
and
to
my
heart
and
i
have
never
loved
another
street
in
quite
the
same
way
my
strand
is
gone
for
ever
some
of
it
is
a
wild
of
purple
flowers
some
of
it
is
imposing
new
buildings
but
one
way
or
another
the
spirit
is
wholly
departed
but
on
that
june
night
in
i
walked
up
surrey
street
and
stood
on
the
strand
pavement
and
looked
before
me
and
to
right
and
to
left
and
gasped
no
man
has
ever
seen
london
but
at
that
moment
i
was
very
near
to
the
vision
the
of
london
after
the
astounding
glimpse
at
the
strand
we
went
back
to
the
private
hotel
in
surrey
street
and
had
something
to
eat
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
the
meal
consisted
of
tea
and
ham
and
eggs
the
latter
beautifully
poached
i
know
that
my
mind
holds
a
recollection
of
this
simple
dish
very
admirably
done
in
connection
with
smith
or
whatever
the
place
was
called
and
i
believe
it
was
eaten
in
the
evening
of
our
arrival
and
i
may
say
in
passing
that
the
hotel
had
a
pleasant
homely
look
about
it
very
plain
but
extremely
comfortable
i
think
that
my
bedroom
carpet
was
threadbare
and
that
the
bed
was
a
feather
bed
at
all
events
one
slept
sublimely
there
under
the
roof
under
the
london
stars
then
for
the
strand
again
now
sunset
flushed
beginning
to
twinkle
with
multitudinous
lamps
i
had
hardly
seen
a
street
before
and
so
to
the
opera
comique
where
they
were
playing
the
pirates
of
penzance
the
opera
comique
was
somewhere
in
wych
street
which
has
gone
the
way
of
the
streets
of
babylon
and
troy
purple
blossoms
and
big
hotels
and
other
theatres
that
i
know
not
grow
now
in
the
place
where
it
once
stood
we
went
to
the
upper
boxes
of
the
opera
comique
and
enjoyed
ourselves
very
well
i
remember
my
father
being
especially
pleased
with
the
pirate
king
defence
of
his
profession
compared
with
respectability
it
almost
honest
or
words
to
that
effect
but
oddly
enough
i
was
a
little
disappointed
there
was
not
the
sense
of
gaiety
that
i
had
expected
for
one
thing
the
music
reminded
me
of
the
classic
glees
and
madrigals
which
i
had
heard
discoursed
by
the
philharmonic
society
at
hereford
where
i
was
at
school
and
i
did
not
want
to
be
reminded
of
hereford
and
the
female
chorus
hardly
looked
as
thoughtless
as
i
could
have
wished
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
might
very
well
have
come
fresh
from
the
rectory
like
myself
of
course
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
ladylike
and
so
forth
but
what
i
asked
of
the
stage
was
careless
devilry
the
suggestion
at
all
events
of
naughtiness
in
fact
my
attitude
was
perilously
near
to
that
of
the
arkansas
audiences
as
analysed
by
the
duke
in
huckleberry
finn
what
they
wanted
was
low
comedy
and
maybe
something
ruther
worse
than
low
comedy
but
i
was
not
really
quite
so
bad
as
the
arkansaw
lunkheads
we
went
on
another
night
to
les
cloches
de
corneville
a
most
harmless
production
i
am
sure
and
was
what
i
wanted
i
was
enchanted
from
the
rising
of
the
curtain
there
was
the
sunlit
scene
in
normandy
charming
smiling
and
a
whole
row
of
pretty
girls
evidently
as
thoughtless
as
the
lightest
heart
could
wish
dancing
down
to
the
footlights
and
singing
just
look
at
that
just
look
at
this
do
you
think
we
not
amiss
a
glance
give
here
a
glance
give
there
tell
us
if
you
think
we
dear
and
not
one
of
these
girls
looked
as
if
she
could
have
come
from
any
conceivable
rectory
decidedly
les
cloches
de
corneville
was
the
comic
opera
for
my
money
what
a
pleasing
thrill
the
scene
afforded
when
the
entire
village
for
some
reason
that
i
can
not
well
remember
dressed
up
as
crusaders
and
crusaderesses
and
came
suddenly
into
the
room
of
gaspard
the
miser
and
the
big
bell
began
to
toll
and
the
gold
was
poured
out
in
a
torrent
on
the
ground
when
the
heir
returneth
then
shall
ring
the
bell
so
the
legend
runneth
so
the
old
men
tell
in
some
such
words
was
this
grand
peripeteia
announced
in
the
text
so
the
heir
no
doubt
returned
and
married
the
extra
pretty
girl
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
she
was
not
serpolette
i
know
for
serpolette
was
comic
delightfully
impudently
comic
but
still
comic
and
so
no
mate
for
the
hero
serpolette
i
think
having
regard
to
the
unities
ought
to
have
married
the
thin
but
amusing
assistant
of
the
bailie
but
i
do
not
know
whether
this
were
so
but
i
am
sure
everybody
was
happy
ever
after
and
of
les
cloches
and
other
comic
operas
like
it
i
say
in
the
words
of
coleridge
friend
them
the
jockeys
for
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
make
up
my
mind
as
to
the
respective
merits
of
les
cloches
de
corneville
and
madame
favart
which
was
running
at
the
strand
les
cloches
had
the
more
coherent
plot
of
the
two
and
the
great
scene
of
the
miser
and
the
crusaders
was
more
effective
in
its
stagey
way
than
anything
in
madame
favart
but
then
florence
john
was
madame
favart
and
to
old
playgoers
i
need
say
no
more
and
marius
a
delightful
french
comedian
was
in
the
cast
and
there
were
those
songs
dear
to
memory
ave
my
mother
the
artless
thing
to
age
dull
december
and
pair
of
lovers
meet
stolen
vows
are
sweet
sighs
etcetera
love
is
all
in
all
on
a
garden
wall
never
heed
papa
this
was
sung
by
marius
who
had
no
voice
in
particular
but
an
infinite
gallic
relish
and
unction
and
finish
in
everything
that
he
did
the
fourth
piece
that
we
went
to
in
this
wonderful
week
was
the
daughter
of
the
drum
major
at
the
alhambra
then
a
theatre
with
an
extremely
roomy
comfortable
pit
this
last
piece
made
but
little
impression
on
me
from
my
recollection
it
seems
to
have
been
more
in
the
modern
mode
that
is
a
mere
excuse
for
showing
off
a
beauty
chorus
without
the
little
touch
of
thin
theatrical
but
pleasant
romance
that
delighted
me
in
the
two
other
plays
but
the
poverty
of
the
play
was
atoned
for
by
the
happy
circumstance
that
before
going
to
it
we
dined
at
the
cavour
and
the
cavour
in
was
exactly
like
the
cavour
in
save
in
this
one
matter
that
on
the
earlier
date
there
was
included
in
the
price
of
the
dinner
a
bottle
of
violet
wine
looking
back
through
the
years
and
comparing
the
london
of
the
early
with
the
london
of
one
circumstance
emerges
very
clearly
in
my
mind
that
is
that
the
early
london
had
an
infinitely
smarter
wealthier
air
than
the
later
i
say
air
advisedly
to
make
it
clear
that
i
knew
nothing
of
the
real
interior
life
of
the
place
or
of
the
resources
of
its
rich
inhabitants
i
judged
of
london
purely
by
its
exterior
aspects
as
one
may
judge
of
a
passing
stranger
in
the
street
and
decide
that
he
goes
to
an
expensive
tailor
without
knowing
anything
of
the
condition
of
his
banking
account
so
i
say
that
the
outward
show
and
lineaments
of
the
london
of
were
much
more
refulgent
and
splendid
than
those
of
the
last
few
years
i
was
a
good
deal
surprised
when
the
truth
of
this
first
dawned
on
me
some
three
or
four
years
ago
for
i
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
new
london
is
a
much
wealthier
more
luxurious
more
extravagant
place
than
the
old
the
rich
people
of
spend
hundreds
instead
of
tens
thousands
for
the
hundreds
of
their
fathers
the
pace
of
the
splendid
has
increased
enormously
in
the
last
years
and
all
the
facilities
for
expending
very
large
sums
of
money
have
also
increased
to
a
huge
extent
so
well
was
i
convinced
of
all
this
when
i
fell
to
comparing
the
london
of
my
boyhood
with
the
london
of
my
middle
age
that
at
first
i
thought
that
there
must
be
a
fallacy
somewhere
and
i
was
very
willing
to
believe
that
those
early
impressions
of
mine
were
illusions
natural
enough
in
a
lad
who
had
never
seen
any
more
splendid
streets
than
those
which
the
newport
and
cardiff
of
those
days
had
to
show
than
the
venerable
peaceful
ancient
ways
of
hereford
whose
stillness
was
only
broken
by
the
deep
sweet
chiming
of
the
cathedral
bells
but
when
interested
i
went
into
the
facts
of
the
question
i
found
that
i
had
not
been
mistaken
in
my
first
view
that
london
was
a
place
thirty
years
ago
than
at
the
present
day
and
this
for
several
reasons
to
begin
with
there
is
the
trifling
matter
of
men
dress
i
do
not
know
whether
we
have
yet
realised
the
fact
that
the
frock
coat
is
rapidly
becoming
costume
verging
that
is
towards
the
status
of
levee
dress
already
i
believe
it
is
only
worn
on
occasions
of
at
functions
where
the
king
is
expected
at
smart
weddings
and
so
forth
before
long
it
will
probably
attain
the
singular
twofold
state
of
evening
dress
which
is
worn
all
day
long
by
waiters
and
by
what
are
conveniently
called
gentlemen
after
seven
in
the
evening
so
very
likely
the
frock
coat
will
soon
be
seen
on
the
backs
of
the
maître
the
hotel
manager
the
shopwalker
the
if
there
be
any
left
as
a
kind
of
uniform
or
livery
while
it
will
also
be
the
afternoon
wear
of
dukes
at
great
social
functions
and
so
with
the
silk
hat
it
has
not
gone
so
far
on
the
road
of
obsolescence
as
the
frock
coat
but
unless
i
mistake
it
has
entered
on
that
sad
way
here
then
is
the
point
of
contrast
between
and
and
later
still
practically
every
man
in
london
went
about
his
business
and
his
pleasure
with
a
high
hat
on
his
head
every
man
i
say
above
the
rank
of
the
mechanic
certainly
all
the
clerkly
class
guppy
and
his
friends
were
still
faithful
to
this
headdress
which
be
it
remembered
was
once
universal
all
over
england
so
that
even
farm
labourers
wore
it
as
for
the
london
of
pleasure
the
west
end
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
to
conceive
a
man
of
the
faintest
social
pretensions
being
seen
abroad
in
anything
else
and
now
i
go
up
and
down
piccadilly
bond
street
the
row
at
the
height
of
the
london
season
and
see
a
few
silk
hats
and
morning
coats
it
is
true
but
the
majority
of
men
in
lounge
suits
and
grey
soft
hats
and
black
and
grey
bowlers
now
let
it
be
clearly
understood
that
i
have
no
passion
for
black
coats
and
shiny
hats
myself
nor
for
the
dazzling
white
linen
which
has
largely
given
way
to
soft
unstarched
stuffs
but
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
all
those
habits
had
a
smart
appearance
and
that
a
pavement
crowded
with
shiny
black
hats
shiny
white
cuffs
and
collars
and
long
black
frock
coats
made
a
much
more
imposing
show
than
the
pavement
of
on
which
the
men
dress
is
very
much
as
they
please
the
modern
men
look
extremely
comfortable
and
well
at
their
ease
but
they
do
not
scintillate
in
the
old
style
a
soft
grey
hat
does
not
flash
back
the
rays
of
the
sun
then
another
point
and
a
most
important
one
the
coming
of
the
motor
i
suppose
the
kind
of
vehicle
which
one
is
likely
to
see
in
hyde
park
may
very
well
have
cost
seven
or
eight
or
nine
or
ten
times
as
much
as
the
carriages
which
i
remember
going
round
and
round
so
gay
and
so
glorious
well
i
have
watched
the
modern
procession
of
and
they
are
about
as
impressive
as
a
career
of
light
locomotive
engines
it
may
indeed
in
course
of
time
become
fashionable
to
go
up
and
down
the
row
in
express
locomotives
capable
of
drawing
their
hundred
coaches
at
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
but
the
effect
would
not
be
smart
now
the
old
equipages
were
undeniably
the
last
word
of
smartness
in
themselves
they
were
enough
to
tell
the
stranger
that
he
had
come
to
the
very
centre
of
the
earth
of
its
riches
and
its
splendours
there
were
the
horses
in
the
first
place
groomed
to
the
last
extreme
of
shiny
satiny
perfection
tossing
their
heads
proudly
and
champing
their
bits
and
doing
the
most
wonderful
things
with
their
legs
the
bright
sunlight
of
those
past
london
summers
shone
on
their
glossy
coats
shone
in
the
patent
leather
of
the
harness
shone
and
glittered
on
the
plated
bolts
and
buckles
and
ornaments
and
the
carriages
were
of
graceful
form
and
the
servants
of
those
days
sometimes
wore
gorgeous
liveries
and
scores
of
those
brilliant
equipages
followed
on
one
another
in
an
unending
dazzling
procession
that
was
the
old
way
now
there
are
some
snorting
billies
that
choke
and
snarl
and
splutter
as
they
dodge
furtively
and
meanly
in
and
out
of
the
park
like
mechanical
rabbits
bolting
for
their
burrows
while
i
contrast
the
london
of
my
young
days
and
the
london
of
my
old
or
present
days
i
would
like
it
to
be
remembered
that
i
am
so
far
only
contrasting
the
two
cities
from
one
point
of
view
the
point
of
view
of
smartness
i
have
not
been
saying
that
london
was
more
sensible
than
london
but
merely
that
the
former
struck
an
outsider
as
a
more
brilliant
place
than
the
modern
city
the
fact
is
that
i
have
the
most
cordial
approval
for
all
social
pomps
and
splendours
so
long
as
i
am
not
required
to
take
part
therein
i
hate
wearing
frock
coats
and
silk
hats
and
shiny
shirts
but
i
am
very
well
pleased
to
sit
in
the
pit
as
it
were
and
watch
those
exalted
persons
who
are
cast
for
the
decorative
parts
going
through
their
brilliant
performances
and
after
all
if
a
man
finds
that
plate
armour
is
uncomfortable
that
is
no
reason
why
he
should
not
delight
in
seeing
other
people
wearing
it
and
wearing
it
with
dignity
and
in
speaking
of
the
hyde
park
and
rotten
row
of
the
old
days
i
mentioned
that
there
were
some
gorgeous
liveries
still
left
in
and
while
we
are
on
that
matter
i
may
say
that
i
have
never
sympathised
at
all
with
those
persons
who
have
found
something
mean
and
ridiculous
in
a
manservant
in
purple
and
gold
or
in
blue
and
crimson
unless
that
is
the
point
be
taken
that
only
a
splendid
duty
should
be
dignified
with
a
splendid
vestment
and
in
that
objection
i
admit
there
is
some
force
not
that
i
agree
for
one
moment
that
there
is
anything
contemptible
in
menial
service
but
i
am
willing
to
allow
that
it
may
not
be
altogether
seemly
for
a
faithful
fellow
whose
business
is
to
hold
on
behind
a
carriage
and
wait
at
dinner
to
outshine
a
bishop
in
pontificals
but
i
suspect
that
the
people
who
sneered
at
poor
jeames
and
his
plush
were
not
actuated
by
this
reasonable
motive
but
rather
by
that
vile
liberal
objection
to
splendour
as
splendour
the
man
who
found
blazes
ridiculous
would
probably
find
the
king
in
his
coronation
robes
equally
ridiculous
and
so
you
may
go
on
up
the
scale
and
down
the
scale
but
the
only
logical
alternative
to
splendour
is
johnson
proposed
suit
of
hide
all
beyond
that
is
superfluity
and
vain
show
according
to
the
doctrine
of
the
wretches
who
in
times
not
long
past
sold
antique
civic
ornaments
such
as
chains
and
maces
on
the
ground
that
the
mayor
of
little
pedlington
did
not
need
such
gauds
to
help
him
in
his
customary
task
of
sentencing
drunks
there
is
one
more
point
in
connection
with
the
row
years
ago
the
appointed
hour
was
five
in
the
afternoon
then
people
sat
in
the
chairs
and
walked
up
and
down
and
looked
at
the
carriages
and
i
remember
a
friend
observing
to
me
this
singularity
that
though
the
place
was
public
and
open
to
anybody
still
only
those
persons
who
were
dressed
in
the
regulation
costume
frock
coat
and
silk
hat
for
men
ever
came
near
the
sacred
ground
the
people
in
lounge
suits
and
bowler
hats
stood
apart
and
watched
the
show
from
some
distance
well
the
hour
of
the
row
is
now
in
the
morning
but
there
is
a
greater
change
there
are
still
smart
people
there
but
there
are
also
people
who
can
not
by
any
possibility
be
described
as
smart
not
even
if
they
be
judged
by
the
very
lax
standards
of
these
days
in
another
matter
the
london
of
is
much
less
impressive
in
its
outward
show
than
the
london
of
that
is
in
the
aspect
of
its
principal
streets
there
are
still
excellent
shops
in
bond
street
regent
street
and
piccadilly
but
there
is
no
longer
in
any
of
them
that
air
of
exclusiveness
and
expensiveness
that
i
can
remember
and
this
is
particularly
true
of
regent
street
in
you
felt
as
soon
as
you
turned
up
the
quadrant
that
anything
you
might
buy
therein
would
certainly
be
dear
the
very
stones
and
stucco
exuded
costliness
and
the
essential
attars
of
luxury
i
feel
convinced
that
the
cigars
of
regent
street
were
of
a
more
curious
aroma
than
cigars
bought
in
any
other
street
that
it
was
the
very
place
wherein
to
purchase
a
great
green
flagon
of
rare
scent
as
a
present
for
a
lady
that
if
you
happened
to
want
a
monte
cristo
emerald
this
was
the
quarter
wherein
to
search
for
it
that
was
my
impression
but
lest
it
should
be
mere
fancy
a
year
or
so
ago
i
asked
one
of
the
older
shopkeepers
whether
the
street
was
quite
what
he
and
i
remembered
it
he
said
very
emphatically
it
was
not
at
all
what
it
had
been
and
i
feel
sure
that
he
was
right
and
that
in
a
less
degree
the
other
principal
shopping
centres
have
declined
from
their
former
splendour
and
this
for
two
reasons
first
the
curious
modern
tendency
of
the
best
and
most
luxurious
shops
to
scatter
and
disperse
themselves
abroad
about
the
side
streets
of
the
west
end
leaving
gaps
which
are
filled
in
most
cases
by
dealers
in
cheaper
wares
and
secondly
the
coming
of
the
popular
has
in
my
opinion
done
a
very
great
deal
to
unsmarten
the
streets
of
which
i
am
speaking
let
it
not
be
understood
for
one
moment
that
i
would
speak
despitefully
of
cheap
that
would
indeed
be
vilely
thankless
in
one
who
has
often
made
the
principal
meal
of
the
day
at
an
large
coffee
threepence
milk
cake
twopence
butter
a
penny
and
has
been
grateful
that
for
once
in
a
way
he
has
dined
but
it
can
not
be
pretended
that
a
milk
cake
is
a
costly
or
a
curious
dish
or
that
a
plate
of
cold
meat
for
sixpence
or
eightpence
is
an
opimian
banquet
and
so
when
i
pass
a
popular
or
i
feel
that
my
dream
of
luxury
and
expense
is
broken
and
that
something
of
glitter
and
splendour
has
passed
away
from
the
west
end
of
london
i
spent
the
years
from
the
summer
of
to
the
winter
of
in
a
singular
sort
of
apprenticeship
to
life
and
london
and
letters
and
to
most
other
things
sometimes
i
was
in
london
then
for
months
at
a
time
i
was
out
of
it
back
again
in
my
old
haunts
of
gwent
i
had
hot
fits
of
desire
for
the
town
when
i
was
forced
to
stay
in
the
country
and
then
settled
or
apparently
settled
in
the
heart
of
london
its
immensities
and
its
solitudes
overwhelmed
me
the
faint
hot
breath
of
its
streets
sickened
me
so
that
my
heart
ached
for
the
thought
of
the
green
wood
by
the
valley
of
the
soar
and
for
the
thought
of
friendly
faces
they
say
that
in
old
japan
they
had
a
wonderful
and
secret
art
of
tempering
their
sword
blades
now
the
steel
was
placed
in
the
white
heat
of
the
fire
now
it
was
withdrawn
and
plunged
into
the
water
of
an
icy
torrent
and
then
again
the
trial
of
the
furnace
so
heat
and
cold
were
alternated
according
to
an
ancient
and
hidden
tradition
till
at
last
the
craftsman
obtained
an
exquisite
and
true
and
perfect
blade
fit
for
the
adorned
scabbard
of
a
great
lord
of
japan
when
i
think
of
those
early
years
of
mine
i
should
be
reminded
of
the
process
of
the
japanese
if
only
the
heart
were
as
tractable
as
steel
the
kabbalists
i
believe
take
the
view
a
gloomy
one
that
the
innermost
essence
of
man
spirit
goes
out
from
the
world
in
much
the
same
state
as
that
in
which
it
came
into
the
world
and
it
is
certainly
true
that
some
men
seem
incorrigible
neither
fire
nor
ice
will
temper
them
aright
during
these
early
years
of
my
london
experience
i
lived
under
very
varying
conditions
i
lived
with
families
and
i
lived
alone
i
lived
in
the
suburbs
and
in
the
centre
i
had
enough
to
eat
and
then
narrowly
escaped
starvation
my
first
habitat
was
in
the
high
street
of
a
southern
suburb
my
memory
holds
a
picture
of
an
ancient
street
of
dignified
houses
a
georgian
church
and
a
stream
of
quite
inky
blackness
the
old
houses
had
old
gardens
behind
them
green
enough
but
with
a
certain
grime
upon
them
that
made
them
strange
to
eyes
unused
to
this
combination
of
soot
and
leafage
but
it
was
quite
easy
in
those
days
to
get
from
the
suburb
to
the
open
country
not
that
i
desired
any
such
excursions
for
my
notion
of
an
ideal
residence
was
then
a
lodging
in
one
of
the
streets
or
courts
or
passages
going
down
from
the
strand
to
the
thames
this
was
a
dream
that
i
realised
years
afterwards
when
many
waters
not
of
the
thames
had
passed
over
my
head
it
was
well
enough
and
i
used
to
go
out
and
get
my
breakfast
at
the
chocolate
as
in
spain
shop
at
the
west
end
of
the
strand
on
the
north
side
it
was
well
enough
i
say
but
it
was
not
absolute
paradise
and
furthermore
and
in
an
interior
parenthesis
let
me
say
that
the
chocolate
at
the
old
strand
shop
was
not
as
in
spain
though
very
decent
chocolate
the
spanish
service
of
chocolate
i
encountered
it
when
i
was
in
gascony
consists
in
this
first
that
the
chocolate
is
made
extremely
strong
and
thick
and
secondly
that
with
it
comes
a
goblet
of
to
be
drunk
after
the
chocolate
on
the
principle
i
suppose
of
the
scots
who
drink
water
not
with
whisky
but
after
it
well
to
return
to
the
more
or
less
chiefly
less
direct
current
of
my
tale
after
my
sojourn
in
the
southern
suburb
came
a
return
to
the
country
where
i
remained
eight
or
nine
months
it
was
during
this
exodus
or
hegira
i
think
that
i
was
excommunicated
by
old
james
of
lansoar
because
i
was
loafing
at
home
instead
of
living
on
five
shillings
a
week
in
london
but
my
long
sojourn
in
gwent
was
in
fact
due
to
a
very
dismal
discovery
having
been
made
of
me
by
certain
persons
called
examiners
they
found
me
utterly
incapable
of
the
simple
rules
of
arithmetic
and
hence
i
was
debarred
from
the
career
which
i
had
been
contemplating
and
here
i
would
say
that
i
am
almost
proud
of
myself
for
my
quite
extraordinary
arithmetical
incapacity
i
am
not
merely
dull
and
slow
but
desperate
i
am
so
wanting
in
the
mere
faculty
of
counting
as
to
be
curious
like
those
tribes
of
savages
that
can
say
one
two
three
four
five
many
there
are
people
who
make
a
living
by
exhibiting
their
arithmetical
skill
in
the
someone
writes
on
the
blackboard
a
multiplication
sum
of
fifteen
figures
multiplied
by
fifteen
figures
and
a
second
or
two
after
the
last
figure
is
drawn
the
arithmetical
artist
utters
the
result
well
i
am
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
scale
and
i
have
sometimes
wondered
whether
incompetent
machen
would
not
be
quite
a
good
turn
it
would
make
anybody
laugh
to
hear
me
doing
a
sum
in
simple
addition
it
is
like
and
nine
and
nine
and
nine
i
ponder
then
a
brilliant
idea
strikes
me
i
pretend
the
problem
is
and
ten
i
get
the
result
deduct
one
and
proceed
well
i
came
to
london
again
in
the
summer
of
thinking
of
another
and
quite
a
different
career
which
did
not
involve
on
the
face
of
it
that
little
difficulty
of
arithmetic
again
i
was
in
a
suburb
and
again
in
an
old
one
but
this
time
the
quarter
was
in
the
far
west
i
stayed
in
turnham
green
then
a
place
of
many
amenities
standing
amongst
fields
and
gardens
and
riparian
lawns
which
long
ago
have
been
buried
beneath
piles
of
cheap
bricks
and
mortar
for
a
year
and
a
half
and
then
again
i
altered
my
plans
or
fate
rather
altered
them
for
me
i
started
on
a
new
tack
and
kept
it
for
a
month
and
then
somehow
slid
into
a
backwater
in
which
i
was
afloat
and
nothing
more
than
afloat
summoning
this
period
into
recollection
i
find
my
position
very
much
like
to
that
of
certain
ancient
and
outworn
barges
that
i
have
come
upon
suddenly
in
improbable
back
alleys
of
water
in
the
midst
of
a
maze
of
at
brentford
but
locally
and
literally
i
was
then
living
in
a
small
room
a
very
small
room
in
clarendon
road
notting
hill
gate
i
have
already
stated
that
when
i
first
came
up
to
london
i
had
no
thought
of
literature
as
a
career
indeed
i
never
have
thought
of
it
as
a
career
but
only
as
a
destiny
still
my
meaning
is
that
it
in
no
wise
dawned
upon
me
as
i
travelled
up
from
newport
to
london
in
the
early
summer
of
that
writing
of
any
kind
or
sort
was
to
be
a
great
part
of
my
life
business
and
yet
before
i
had
lived
a
month
in
the
old
red
house
by
the
inky
stream
i
was
trying
to
write
in
the
intervals
of
a
very
different
task
in
an
atmosphere
which
was
utterly
remote
from
literature
of
any
kind
how
was
this
partly
i
suppose
because
of
the
very
large
proportion
of
celtic
blood
in
my
veins
it
is
quite
true
that
the
celt
the
welsh
celt
at
all
events
has
directly
contributed
very
little
to
great
literature
this
i
have
always
maintained
and
always
shall
maintain
and
i
think
all
impartial
judges
will
allow
that
if
welsh
literature
were
annihilated
at
this
moment
the
loss
to
the
grand
roll
of
masterpieces
would
be
insignificant
i
speaking
from
the
point
of
view
of
my
own
peculiar
interests
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
miss
my
copy
of
the
mabinogion
and
there
are
certain
stanzas
of
the
poem
called
y
beddau
vain
is
it
to
seek
for
the
grave
of
arthur
which
have
a
singular
and
enchanting
and
wizard
music
but
in
neither
case
is
there
any
question
of
a
literary
masterpiece
yet
there
is
in
celtdom
a
certain
literary
feeling
which
does
not
exist
in
it
is
diffused
no
doubt
and
appreciative
rather
than
creative
and
lacking
in
the
sterner
critical
spirit
which
is
so
necessary
to
all
creative
work
still
it
is
there
and
it
is
delighted
with
the
rolling
sound
of
the
noble
phrase
it
perceives
the
music
of
words
and
the
relation
of
that
music
to
the
world
i
was
taking
a
lesson
in
welsh
pronunciation
some
time
ago
and
uttered
the
phrase
yn
oes
oesodd
from
ages
to
ages
that
is
right
said
my
welsh
friend
speak
it
so
that
it
makes
a
sound
like
the
wind
about
the
mountains
and
with
or
without
the
leave
of
the
literary
rationalists
i
would
say
that
the
spirit
of
that
sentence
is
very
near
to
the
heart
of
true
literature
so
far
then
as
a
man
celt
i
was
by
nature
inclined
to
the
work
of
words
and
there
was
moreover
a
feeble
literary
strain
in
my
own
family
there
was
a
second
cousin
or
welsh
uncle
i
am
not
certain
which
who
had
composed
a
heroic
blank
verse
drama
called
inez
de
castro
which
was
almost
but
not
quite
represented
by
the
famous
somebody
at
the
lane
in
the
early
and
then
more
potent
still
was
the
heredity
of
bookishness
the
growing
up
among
books
that
had
accrued
from
grandfathers
and
uncles
and
cousins
all
men
who
had
lived
all
their
days
amongst
books
and
had
sat
over
country
hearths
on
mountain
sides
reading
this
leathern
colloquies
of
erasmus
this
little
horace
in
mellow
parchment
with
the
sphere
of
elzevir
and
then
there
was
the
grammar
school
education
of
which
it
must
be
said
by
friends
and
foes
that
it
is
an
education
in
words
one
spent
one
time
unconsciously
in
weighing
the
values
of
words
in
english
and
greek
and
latin
in
rendering
one
tongue
into
another
in
estimating
the
exact
sense
of
an
english
sentence
before
translating
it
into
one
or
another
of
the
old
tongues
so
that
a
boy
who
could
do
decent
latin
prose
must
first
have
mastered
the
exact
sense
and
significance
of
his
english
original
and
then
he
must
also
have
made
himself
understand
to
a
certain
extent
not
only
the
logic
but
the
polite
habit
of
each
language
i
remember
when
i
was
a
very
small
boy
rendering
put
to
the
sword
literally
into
gladio
positi
well
said
my
master
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
why
the
romans
have
said
positi
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
say
occisi
killed
with
iron
and
if
one
thinks
of
it
he
who
has
mastered
that
little
lesson
has
also
mastered
the
larger
lesson
that
literature
is
above
logic
that
there
are
matters
in
it
which
transcend
plain
common
sense
and
so
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
was
that
in
i
began
to
try
to
write
now
i
believe
that
one
of
the
most
tortuous
and
difficult
questions
that
engages
philosophy
is
the
theory
of
cause
and
effect
i
think
though
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
in
one
of
balfour
philosophical
books
this
matter
is
treated
and
the
familiar
case
of
a
sportsman
pulling
a
trigger
firing
a
gun
and
thereby
bringing
down
a
bird
is
made
an
instance
what
is
the
cause
of
the
bird
death
roughly
speaking
of
course
the
pulling
of
the
trigger
but
roughly
speaking
is
not
the
same
thing
as
philosophically
speaking
and
if
anyone
be
so
simple
as
to
conclude
that
roughly
speaking
means
truly
speaking
and
that
philosophy
is
all
nonsense
let
me
remind
him
that
when
he
enjoys
his
cigar
in
his
he
is
not
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
is
being
whirled
through
space
like
a
top
at
the
most
terrific
speed
so
if
i
remember
rightly
balfour
left
the
philosophical
cause
of
the
bird
death
an
open
question
if
not
a
question
altogether
beyond
determination
of
human
wit
and
thus
it
is
with
the
impulse
that
sends
off
a
harmless
young
fellow
on
the
career
of
letters
one
can
talk
of
the
causes
that
impel
a
grain
of
corn
to
grow
from
the
ground
sound
seed
good
soil
good
farming
dry
weather
wet
weather
each
in
its
season
but
at
the
last
the
engendering
of
the
green
shoot
remains
a
mystery
and
so
it
is
a
mystery
that
near
midsummer
in
i
suddenly
began
to
write
horrible
rubbish
in
a
little
manuscript
book
with
a
scarlet
cover
rubbish
that
had
rhymes
to
it
but
if
ultimate
causes
lie
beyond
those
flaming
walls
of
the
world
that
put
bounds
to
all
our
inquisition
it
is
not
so
hard
to
trace
those
causes
which
are
proximate
the
bird
dies
because
the
shot
hit
it
in
a
vital
part
the
corn
sprouts
because
it
is
put
into
the
ground
and
i
began
to
write
because
i
bought
a
copy
of
swinburne
songs
before
sunrise
i
forget
how
i
heard
of
this
name
which
once
loomed
so
fiery
and
strange
a
portent
which
still
in
the
estimation
of
many
excellent
judges
stands
for
a
great
literary
achievement
i
know
it
was
while
i
was
down
in
the
country
because
i
can
remember
one
of
our
clergy
an
eton
and
christchurch
man
telling
me
gossip
about
the
poet
who
had
in
those
early
days
retired
from
the
world
to
putney
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
i
had
read
something
concerning
swinburne
in
one
of
those
wonderful
london
papers
that
came
over
our
hills
from
another
world
that
might
almost
have
fallen
from
the
stars
they
were
so
wholly
marvellous
but
somehow
or
other
i
was
possessed
by
an
eager
curiosity
concerning
this
swinburne
convinced
in
advance
i
can
not
remember
how
that
here
i
should
surely
find
an
unexpected
unsurmised
treasure
and
so
one
hot
shiny
afternoon
i
came
up
from
the
old
georgian
suburb
by
the
black
stream
crossed
hungerford
bridge
and
made
my
way
into
the
strand
into
that
strand
which
is
as
lost
as
atlantis
and
going
eastward
past
many
vanished
things
past
the
rich
odours
of
rimell
i
came
to
and
the
entrance
of
holywell
street
at
the
southern
corner
of
this
street
facing
the
east
end
of
the
church
there
stood
denny
bookshop
and
gold
in
my
pocket
i
went
in
with
a
bold
appearance
and
said
have
you
got
swinburne
before
sunrise
the
shopman
did
not
seem
in
the
least
astonished
at
my
question
he
said
he
had
got
the
book
and
produced
it
and
showed
it
me
and
the
very
cover
was
such
as
i
had
never
seen
before
provocative
therefore
in
a
high
degree
and
so
i
bought
the
book
and
carried
it
out
of
denny
into
the
sunlight
in
a
great
amazement
for
be
it
remembered
one
did
not
go
into
a
provincial
bookshop
in
that
easy
way
and
say
have
you
got
this
or
that
for
the
chances
were
about
a
thousand
to
one
that
they
had
got
it
and
never
would
have
it
it
is
odd
but
i
can
not
remember
exactly
the
nature
of
the
stock
of
the
average
country
bookseller
my
impression
is
of
bibles
prayer
books
church
services
and
pitman
shorthand
manuals
so
if
you
wanted
a
book
in
the
county
town
you
did
not
say
have
you
got
but
will
you
get
me
and
in
four
or
five
days
you
called
and
the
book
was
ready
but
i
had
a
notion
that
in
this
wonderful
london
the
bookshop
would
actually
have
the
book
that
you
wanted
there
actually
in
presence
and
waiting
for
you
on
its
shelves
i
had
a
notion
i
say
but
again
it
seemed
almost
incredible
that
there
should
be
such
shops
in
the
world
and
so
when
the
bookseller
under
said
yes
quite
simply
and
handed
me
the
songs
before
sunrise
in
two
or
three
seconds
i
was
amazed
and
exultant
too
the
legend
of
london
though
marvellous
was
evidently
a
true
one
now
i
have
a
friend
who
is
very
fond
of
preaching
the
doctrine
of
what
he
calls
the
cataclysm
he
holds
that
we
are
all
much
bettered
by
an
occasional
earthquake
moral
mental
or
spiritual
he
says
that
volcanoes
which
suddenly
burst
out
from
under
our
feet
are
the
finest
tonics
in
the
world
that
violent
thunderstorms
and
tornadoes
clear
our
mental
skies
the
treatment
is
heroic
but
my
friend
may
be
right
certainly
that
volume
of
songs
before
sunrise
was
to
me
quite
cataclysmic
first
there
was
the
literary
manner
of
the
book
which
to
me
was
wholly
strange
and
new
and
wonderful
and
then
there
was
the
tremendous
boldness
of
it
all
the
denial
of
everything
that
i
had
been
brought
up
to
believe
most
sure
and
sacred
the
book
was
positively
strewn
with
the
fragments
of
shattered
altars
and
the
torn
limbs
of
kings
and
priests
how
do
the
lines
go
i
quote
from
memory
but
they
run
something
like
this
thou
hast
taken
all
galilæan
but
these
thou
shalt
not
take
the
laurel
the
doves
and
the
pæan
the
breasts
of
the
nymph
in
the
brake
clearly
this
was
a
terrible
a
tremendous
fellow
an
poet
and
so
between
my
endeavours
to
qualify
for
passing
the
preliminary
examination
of
the
royal
college
of
surgeons
i
began
to
write
i
should
think
the
most
horrible
drivel
that
ever
has
been
written
since
rhymes
first
jingled
i
ca
remember
oddly
enough
whether
i
tried
to
imitate
swinburne
i
know
one
copy
of
verses
was
inspired
by
a
picture
called
harmony
which
i
think
was
hung
in
the
academy
of
it
depicted
a
mediæval
maiden
playing
the
organ
while
a
mediæval
youth
watched
her
in
a
dazed
and
condition
this
is
positively
the
only
one
of
these
early
horrors
of
mine
of
which
i
have
any
recollection
my
memory
is
purged
of
the
rest
of
them
i
am
glad
to
say
i
merely
mention
these
things
because
they
illustrate
a
very
singular
point
in
literary
psychology
in
universal
psychology
for
the
matter
of
that
for
i
believe
it
is
a
rule
that
almost
every
literary
career
certainly
every
literary
career
which
is
to
be
concerned
with
the
imaginative
side
of
literature
begins
with
the
writing
of
verses
nay
people
who
are
to
live
lives
quite
remote
from
literature
will
often
try
to
write
poetry
in
their
youth
and
on
the
face
of
it
this
is
a
great
puzzle
for
poetry
be
it
remembered
is
the
most
artificial
kind
of
literary
composition
it
is
immeasurably
the
most
difficult
it
is
by
far
the
most
remote
from
that
which
is
commonly
called
life
why
then
does
the
inexperienced
beginner
devoid
of
all
technical
ability
invariably
essay
this
most
difficult
technical
task
on
his
entry
into
the
literary
career
the
problem
of
the
boy
in
the
back
room
not
far
from
the
dark
stream
of
the
wandle
writing
verses
in
the
red
notebook
is
really
one
of
the
enigmas
of
the
universe
it
is
rather
a
puzzle
riddle
is
within
riddle
for
if
we
start
at
the
beginning
of
things
or
at
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
beginning
of
things
we
are
met
by
the
question
as
to
why
there
should
be
any
such
thing
as
poetry
in
the
universe
i
need
not
say
how
much
wider
this
question
is
than
it
seems
how
it
must
be
asked
about
all
the
arts
about
fugues
and
cathedrals
and
romances
and
dances
it
is
an
immense
question
immense
when
one
considers
that
with
nine
people
out
of
ten
the
great
criterion
is
does
it
pay
that
is
will
it
result
in
a
larger
supply
of
fine
champagne
four
ale
roast
legs
of
pork
and
mousses
royales
to
the
population
will
this
scheme
of
things
enable
sir
john
to
keep
a
fifth
or
will
it
get
bill
meat
three
times
a
day
that
is
at
last
the
test
by
which
we
judge
all
things
it
is
an
old
and
approved
british
test
by
it
macaulay
condemned
the
whole
of
greek
philosophy
because
that
philosophy
did
not
lead
up
to
the
invention
of
the
steam
engine
now
it
is
quite
clear
that
poetry
speaking
generally
pays
neither
the
producer
nor
the
consumer
of
it
it
does
not
lead
to
beefsteaks
vintage
clarets
or
four
ale
it
is
not
even
moral
not
a
single
man
has
ever
been
induced
to
drink
instead
of
beer
by
reading
keats
i
must
pause
for
a
moment
i
fear
that
it
may
be
thought
that
i
am
trying
to
be
funny
or
more
injurious
accusation
trying
to
be
clever
i
am
not
trying
to
be
either
i
am
stating
the
simple
facts
of
the
case
hardly
a
month
passes
by
without
some
indignant
person
pointing
out
in
the
press
that
engineering
and
commercial
chemistry
are
infinitely
more
useful
lead
to
more
beefsteaks
than
latin
and
greek
and
that
when
oxford
and
cambridge
find
out
that
obvious
truth
they
may
become
of
some
service
to
the
state
indeed
it
is
only
a
few
weeks
ago
since
a
gentleman
wrote
to
a
paper
showing
that
military
training
was
better
for
a
boy
would
make
him
the
better
soldier
than
silly
old
greek
plays
and
let
me
acknowledge
that
these
contentions
are
perfectly
true
just
as
it
is
perfectly
true
that
fur
coats
are
much
warmer
than
alcaics
so
i
say
here
is
the
problem
the
common
widely
accepted
test
of
the
right
to
existence
of
everything
does
it
pay
does
it
add
to
the
physical
comforts
of
life
is
quite
clearly
opposed
to
the
existence
of
poetry
and
yet
poetry
exists
therefore
either
the
poets
and
the
lovers
of
poetry
are
mad
or
else
the
common
judgment
is
let
us
say
mistaken
i
need
scarcely
say
that
i
incline
to
the
latter
solution
of
the
problem
and
so
qua
human
being
i
am
not
ashamed
of
trying
to
write
poetry
by
the
wandle
though
i
recognise
qua
arthur
machen
that
i
was
very
decidedly
not
born
a
poet
for
i
firmly
hold
the
doctrine
that
the
natural
the
expression
of
man
so
far
as
he
is
to
be
distinguished
from
pigs
and
dogs
and
goats
is
in
the
arts
and
through
the
arts
and
by
the
arts
it
is
not
by
reason
as
reason
is
commonly
understood
that
man
is
distinguished
from
the
other
animals
but
by
art
i
can
quite
well
conceive
the
black
ants
sending
the
message
hill
fell
before
the
red
ant
attack
early
this
afternoon
but
i
can
not
conceive
either
red
or
black
ants
writing
odes
or
building
miniature
cathedrals
the
arts
then
are
man
difference
that
which
makes
him
to
be
what
he
is
and
when
he
speaks
through
them
he
is
using
the
utterance
which
is
proper
to
him
as
man
for
if
we
once
set
aside
the
does
it
pay
nonsense
which
is
evidently
nonsense
and
pestilent
nonsense
at
that
we
come
clearly
and
freely
to
the
truth
that
man
is
concerned
with
beauty
and
with
the
ecstasy
or
rapture
that
proceeds
from
the
creation
of
beauty
and
from
the
contemplation
of
it
and
youth
as
i
think
i
have
pointed
out
before
is
the
time
of
revelation
it
is
children
who
possess
the
kingdom
of
heaven
to
them
are
vouchsafed
glimpses
of
that
paradise
which
is
the
true
home
of
man
and
so
it
is
that
the
boy
with
literature
in
his
blood
naturally
makes
his
first
efforts
in
the
region
of
poetry
which
is
the
heart
and
core
of
all
literature
the
heart
and
core
for
as
in
the
individual
man
so
in
the
whole
history
of
men
literature
begins
always
with
poetry
just
as
speech
began
with
song
first
the
magic
incantation
sung
about
strange
secret
fires
in
hidden
places
by
wild
men
then
the
ballad
or
lyric
then
homer
then
herodotus
with
the
odours
of
the
sanctuary
of
poetry
still
about
him
though
he
has
come
down
into
the
of
prose
and
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
farther
in
time
or
space
than
the
northumberland
of
a
few
years
ago
to
hear
phrases
common
enough
things
of
everyday
set
to
enchanting
melodies
i
shall
never
forget
how
once
in
the
years
of
my
wandering
i
came
one
wet
autumn
afternoon
to
a
little
town
called
morpeth
it
struck
me
as
a
dingy
place
enough
un
petit
trou
de
province
sale
noir
boueux
and
my
lodging
was
dingy
and
musty
too
in
a
house
kept
by
an
old
invalid
woman
who
moved
about
in
a
wheel
chair
and
grumbled
if
a
window
were
opened
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
the
stroller
tea
the
who
came
i
think
from
the
wild
places
of
that
land
said
consolingly
you
need
not
trouble
yourselves
you
shall
have
your
tea
in
half
an
hour
no
doubt
the
girl
was
mortal
but
she
spoke
the
tongue
of
the
immortals
her
phrase
about
our
tea
was
chanted
to
an
exquisite
melody
that
might
have
come
from
the
gradual
or
from
fairyland
the
natural
man
then
is
a
singer
and
a
poet
and
so
we
may
say
that
all
artists
are
in
reality
survivals
from
an
earlier
time
and
so
it
is
that
even
in
these
later
days
the
lad
with
something
of
the
youth
and
true
nature
of
his
race
restored
to
him
for
a
brief
hour
sits
in
solitary
places
and
endeavours
to
exercise
his
birthright
alas
he
stutters
deplorably
in
his
speech
as
he
delays
by
the
wandle
inditing
verses
but
it
is
thus
that
he
would
declare
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
no
mean
city
he
would
fain
say
through
those
sorry
rhymes
coelestis
well
i
saw
the
first
of
augustus
harris
autumn
dramas
at
drury
lane
heard
the
newsboys
calling
out
the
death
of
miss
neilson
one
misty
evening
up
and
down
the
strand
and
went
back
to
gwent
in
the
character
of
a
bad
penny
and
so
fell
to
writing
of
those
autumn
and
winter
nights
when
all
the
house
was
still
poor
wretch
for
this
is
the
misery
of
literature
that
it
has
no
technique
in
the
sense
that
music
and
painting
have
each
its
own
technique
the
young
painter
and
the
young
composer
having
acquired
a
certain
mechanical
skill
in
the
elements
of
their
arts
have
studios
and
schools
which
they
can
attend
they
have
masters
who
lead
them
in
their
several
ways
or
who
tell
them
if
necessary
to
abandon
those
ways
with
all
convenient
speed
but
for
the
lad
with
letters
on
the
brain
there
is
no
help
no
guidance
nor
is
there
the
possibility
of
any
direction
in
the
literary
path
now
and
then
people
send
me
manuscripts
and
ask
for
my
opinion
i
give
it
because
i
am
weak
but
i
always
tell
them
that
in
literature
the
other
man
opinion
is
not
worth
twopence
no
the
only
course
is
to
go
on
stumbling
and
struggling
and
blundering
like
a
man
lost
in
a
dense
thicket
on
a
dark
night
a
thicket
i
say
of
rebounding
boughs
that
punish
with
the
sting
of
a
of
thorns
that
most
savagely
lacerate
the
flesh
it
is
the
flesh
of
the
heart
alas
that
they
tear
of
sharp
rocks
of
agony
and
black
pools
of
despair
such
is
the
obscure
wood
of
the
literary
life
such
at
least
it
was
to
me
you
struggle
to
find
your
way
but
again
and
again
you
ask
yourself
whether
for
you
there
is
any
way
you
think
you
have
hit
upon
the
lucky
track
at
last
and
lo
before
your
feet
is
the
black
pit
and
such
is
not
alone
the
adventure
of
little
ineffectual
struggling
men
how
old
was
glorious
cervantes
now
serene
for
ever
amongst
the
immortals
when
he
found
his
way
to
that
village
of
la
mancha
fifty
i
think
or
almost
fifty
and
he
had
been
striving
for
years
to
write
plays
and
poetry
and
short
stories
of
passion
and
sentiment
and
it
was
only
the
roar
of
applause
that
thundered
up
from
the
world
when
the
knight
and
the
squire
were
seen
riding
over
the
hill
that
convinced
cervantes
that
at
last
he
had
discovered
his
true
path
if
indeed
he
ever
were
convinced
in
his
heart
of
the
magnitude
and
majesty
of
the
achievement
of
don
quixote
and
if
these
things
are
done
with
the
great
what
will
be
done
with
the
little
if
the
rulers
of
the
everlasting
choir
are
to
suffer
so
and
agonise
what
of
miserable
little
welshmen
stammering
and
stuttering
by
the
wandle
in
the
obscure
rectory
amongst
the
hills
in
waste
places
by
shepherd
bush
in
gloomy
great
russell
street
where
the
ghosts
of
dead
disappointed
authors
go
sighing
to
and
fro
for
the
fate
of
the
little
literary
man
there
is
no
articulate
speech
that
is
sufficient
one
must
fall
back
on
aoi
or
oimoi
or
alas
or
some
such
vague
lament
of
unutterable
woe
now
one
of
the
first
agonies
of
the
learner
in
letters
is
the
discovery
of
the
horrid
gulf
that
yawns
between
the
conception
and
the
execution
some
years
before
this
winter
of
when
i
was
at
school
i
had
read
the
tale
of
owain
in
the
mabinogion
of
the
magic
sudden
storm
and
of
the
singing
of
the
birds
after
it
and
going
out
for
a
walk
one
with
a
just
such
a
sudden
storm
as
it
seemed
to
me
overtook
us
as
we
went
down
into
a
beautiful
valley
not
far
from
hereford
and
after
it
there
was
a
like
joyful
singing
of
birds
in
the
trees
and
somehow
the
magic
atmosphere
of
the
old
tale
mingled
with
the
enacting
as
it
were
of
one
of
its
chief
circumstances
left
on
my
mind
a
very
strong
and
singular
impression
which
when
the
desire
of
literature
came
upon
me
i
yearned
to
put
into
words
i
did
so
in
the
blank
verse
form
and
sent
the
poem
to
the
gentleman
magazine
and
this
i
think
was
my
first
attempt
to
get
into
print
i
need
not
say
that
my
nonsense
was
returned
to
me
with
thanks
but
i
wish
i
knew
why
i
chose
that
particular
magazine
it
must
have
had
some
especial
attraction
for
me
since
ten
years
later
i
sent
sylvanus
urban
a
prose
article
which
he
accepted
and
paid
for
at
the
appropriate
rate
of
a
guinea
a
sheet
that
is
sixteen
pages
but
i
must
say
in
all
fairness
that
sylvanus
warned
me
in
advance
of
his
rate
of
payment
but
that
gulf
between
the
idea
as
it
glows
warm
and
radiant
in
the
author
heart
and
its
cold
and
faulty
realisation
in
words
is
an
early
nightmare
and
a
late
one
too
for
the
beginner
if
he
suffer
from
many
terrible
disappointments
has
also
the
consolations
of
hope
fallacious
though
these
may
prove
to
be
this
scheme
that
looked
so
well
has
certainly
come
to
the
saddest
grief
but
there
may
be
better
luck
next
time
if
this
road
have
led
to
nothing
but
a
blank
wall
of
failure
that
way
may
rise
from
the
valley
and
climb
the
hill
and
lead
into
a
fair
land
it
is
later
in
the
life
of
the
literary
man
when
he
has
tried
all
roads
and
made
all
the
experiments
that
his
final
sorrow
comes
upon
him
he
may
not
be
forced
to
say
perhaps
that
he
has
been
a
total
failure
he
may
indeed
be
able
to
chronicle
achievements
of
a
minor
kind
successes
in
the
estimation
of
others
but
now
with
riper
understanding
he
perceives
as
he
did
not
perceive
in
the
days
of
his
youth
the
depth
of
the
gulf
between
the
idea
and
the
word
between
the
emotion
that
thrilled
him
to
his
very
heart
and
soul
and
the
sorry
page
of
print
into
which
that
emotion
stands
translated
he
dreamed
in
fire
he
has
worked
in
clay
i
did
not
know
happily
for
myself
of
these
things
in
the
ending
of
the
year
and
so
when
all
the
rectory
was
abed
and
asleep
i
sat
up
by
a
dying
fire
writing
a
poem
on
a
classic
subject
the
classic
poem
was
finished
some
time
in
the
winter
of
and
then
i
performed
a
bold
action
i
sent
the
manuscript
i
can
see
it
now
written
in
a
sprawly
hand
on
both
sides
of
ordinary
letter
paper
to
a
hereford
stationer
and
bade
him
print
me
one
hundred
copies
thereof
he
strangely
enough
did
so
and
i
saw
myself
in
print
for
the
first
time
i
have
been
looking
at
my
copy
of
this
work
i
should
think
the
only
copy
in
existence
and
wondering
whether
i
would
quote
a
few
lines
from
it
i
have
decided
against
this
course
but
after
all
i
was
only
seventeen
when
i
wrote
eleusinia
but
the
little
pamphlet
had
its
influence
on
my
life
my
relations
decided
after
reading
it
that
journalism
was
the
career
for
me
a
decision
that
then
seemed
to
me
both
reasonable
and
pleasant
which
now
strikes
me
with
amazement
nay
with
stupefaction
since
those
days
i
have
found
out
a
good
many
things
concerning
both
poetry
and
journalism
and
looking
over
that
old
copy
of
eleusinia
i
have
meditated
on
what
career
i
should
advise
for
the
author
of
that
work
if
he
were
now
to
consult
me
i
give
it
up
i
abandon
the
problem
utterly
and
yet
strange
as
it
seems
strange
most
of
all
to
me
my
relations
were
justified
after
all
i
did
become
a
journalist
just
thirty
years
afterwards
but
by
those
who
had
arranged
this
destiny
for
me
were
long
dead
and
delivered
from
all
their
troubles
i
remember
my
father
who
knew
about
as
much
of
the
matter
as
i
did
sketching
out
my
future
career
i
was
to
go
to
london
to
learn
the
business
first
of
all
shorthand
of
course
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
a
chief
portion
of
the
task
he
said
half
jocularly
would
be
to
lurk
in
the
of
great
houses
and
write
down
the
names
of
distinguished
guests
on
the
nights
of
grand
receptions
and
then
eventually
some
few
hundreds
would
come
to
me
and
with
this
i
was
to
buy
an
interest
in
a
small
local
paper
and
so
i
suppose
write
leaders
and
live
happily
ever
after
the
programme
has
not
been
carried
out
literally
the
few
hundreds
have
been
more
agreeably
spent
long
years
ago
and
my
editor
never
sent
me
to
get
the
names
of
distinguished
guests
at
great
houses
knowing
wise
man
that
i
should
make
a
sad
mess
of
such
a
business
but
one
of
my
first
assignments
in
journalism
was
to
describe
a
giant
apple
i
chased
after
that
apple
from
bond
street
to
covent
garden
from
covent
garden
back
to
bond
street
and
wrote
in
my
paper
about
its
smiling
face
wishing
my
poor
father
were
alive
to
hear
the
story
of
my
entrance
into
the
art
and
mystery
of
the
journalist
he
would
have
laughed
consumedly
and
from
my
dear
remembrance
of
him
i
think
he
would
have
found
a
quotation
from
horace
to
meet
the
case
once
i
recollect
it
turned
out
that
the
odd
man
at
the
rectory
supposed
to
be
a
bachelor
had
abandoned
a
wife
and
twelve
children
all
of
them
small
ones
for
aught
i
know
somewhere
in
gloucestershire
a
policeman
came
for
poor
robert
and
my
father
was
very
sorry
for
the
man
even
though
he
were
a
sad
dog
and
a
notorious
toper
of
ale
but
the
rector
thought
of
the
phrase
raro
antecedentem
scelestum
deseruit
poena
and
cheered
up
amazingly
well
on
the
strength
of
the
verses
about
the
eleusinian
mysteries
i
am
to
be
a
journalist
and
consequently
as
it
was
thought
in
those
days
i
must
learn
shorthand
so
that
i
may
be
able
to
write
a
hundred
and
fifty
words
in
a
minute
and
here
again
comes
a
chapter
as
sad
as
that
which
i
have
written
on
my
arithmetic
i
never
learnt
shorthand
effectively
because
i
was
too
stupid
to
learn
it
the
queer
thing
is
that
when
i
was
quite
a
little
boy
at
school
this
art
of
shorthand
had
a
strange
and
mysterious
attraction
for
me
why
i
am
sure
i
do
know
why
did
the
small
boys
of
my
generation
love
dark
lanterns
robert
louis
stevenson
has
written
an
enchanting
essay
on
the
fascination
of
this
instrument
of
the
mysteries
but
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
even
he
has
penetrated
to
the
heart
of
the
enigma
for
i
though
a
lonely
child
knew
the
joy
of
the
dark
lantern
and
it
was
a
great
and
exceeding
joy
the
glowing
of
heat
that
rose
from
its
roof
corrugated
i
think
the
rank
smell
of
its
oils
were
charms
that
somehow
carried
me
over
the
borders
of
this
common
world
into
an
exquisite
region
of
wonder
and
surmise
and
now
i
come
to
look
back
into
days
horribly
distant
the
shorthand
question
must
wait
for
a
while
i
perceive
that
there
was
a
perfect
ritual
or
ceremonial
rather
of
the
dark
lantern
the
origins
of
which
are
as
obscure
to
me
as
are
the
origins
of
other
primitive
mysteries
of
one
thing
only
i
am
certain
and
i
speak
with
all
due
deference
to
the
author
of
the
golden
bough
not
forgetting
miss
jane
harrison
the
lantern
service
of
my
early
boyhood
had
no
reference
whatever
to
the
young
crops
or
to
the
sprouting
of
the
corn
as
i
lit
the
wick
i
did
not
say
o
sun
shine
thou
also
on
the
land
and
make
it
warm
so
that
there
may
be
many
cabbages
so
that
green
peas
may
not
be
lacking
to
the
lamb
which
is
equally
nurtured
by
thy
beams
of
course
i
am
quite
willing
to
allow
that
as
a
general
rule
an
anxiety
about
the
spring
crops
fully
explains
the
origin
of
all
painting
all
sculpture
all
architecture
all
poetry
all
drama
all
music
all
religion
all
romance
i
admit
that
the
holy
gospels
are
really
all
about
spring
cabbage
that
martyrdom
and
mass
are
spring
cabbage
that
arthur
is
really
arator
the
ploughman
that
galahad
denoting
the
achievement
and
end
of
the
great
quest
is
caulahad
the
cabbage
god
i
admit
all
this
because
it
is
so
entirely
reasonable
and
satisfactory
and
indeed
but
though
all
frazerdom
should
rise
up
against
me
i
can
not
allow
that
when
i
lit
my
dark
lantern
i
was
inviting
the
sun
to
help
the
crops
there
was
some
sort
of
obscure
connection
i
seem
to
remember
between
dark
lanterns
and
masks
they
were
both
properties
in
singular
mysteries
of
a
formless
character
which
were
enacted
in
dark
shrubberies
on
dark
nights
just
before
it
was
well
understood
i
know
that
these
objects
must
be
kept
in
secret
places
and
must
not
by
any
means
be
seen
by
the
uninitiated
and
the
uninitiated
were
everybody
besides
myself
and
here
i
believe
i
was
following
unconsciously
but
most
strictly
the
rules
of
all
primitive
mysteries
throughout
the
world
the
greeks
of
the
historical
period
had
become
lax
they
carried
about
the
mystic
fan
of
iacchus
in
public
procession
but
amongst
the
blackfellows
of
australia
where
the
rites
are
much
nearer
to
the
original
purity
of
their
institution
the
mystic
fan
is
not
seen
only
heard
therefore
the
dark
lantern
and
the
mask
were
kept
hidden
in
an
obscure
cranny
of
the
which
was
at
the
end
of
an
overshadowed
drive
at
some
distance
from
the
rectory
they
were
produced
under
the
cover
of
the
darkness
these
sacramental
instruments
clouds
and
stars
and
the
dim
boughs
of
trees
and
tangled
undergrowth
alone
saw
them
there
were
certain
solemn
words
which
accompanied
the
ostension
of
the
objects
but
they
were
in
a
language
which
i
have
long
forgotten
but
some
day
when
the
turmoil
has
died
down
when
the
clouds
have
cleared
for
the
sunset
and
the
apparition
of
the
evening
star
as
i
sit
by
a
western
shore
awaiting
the
boat
of
avalon
i
shall
write
my
last
treatise
under
the
title
of
the
dark
lantern
and
the
mask
vere
and
here
i
give
notice
to
all
good
and
lawful
men
that
i
am
duly
seized
of
the
above
title
so
that
they
may
abstain
from
intromitting
with
the
same
this
digression
of
the
dark
lantern
proceeded
naturally
enough
from
my
speaking
of
shorthand
this
art
i
said
appealed
to
me
when
i
was
a
boy
and
its
appeal
was
that
of
a
kind
of
mystery
writing
of
a
script
not
in
common
use
for
my
acquaintance
did
not
lie
in
journalistic
circles
i
knew
nobody
who
could
write
shorthand
or
understood
anything
about
it
and
so
the
three
books
of
pitman
teacher
manual
and
reporter
were
three
mystery
books
so
far
as
my
small
world
was
concerned
but
now
in
later
years
having
written
that
famous
poem
on
the
initiation
of
eleusis
i
was
to
be
a
journalist
and
to
be
a
journalist
i
must
learn
shorthand
and
then
i
found
phonography
a
mystery
indeed
and
too
great
a
mystery
for
me
since
i
could
not
attain
to
it
i
muddled
about
with
it
for
three
or
four
years
i
actually
made
some
use
of
it
in
one
of
my
queer
employments
but
i
never
wrote
it
decently
i
was
too
try
as
i
would
i
could
not
form
the
characters
with
elegance
or
accuracy
my
p
and
b
would
wobble
and
bend
till
they
looked
like
f
and
v
if
i
tried
to
halve
a
letter
i
quartered
it
a
kindly
reporter
gave
me
a
hint
do
bother
about
the
thick
and
thin
lines
he
said
i
never
do
and
no
doubt
the
skilled
shorthand
writer
can
play
all
manner
of
tricks
with
the
system
but
i
was
not
a
skilled
writer
and
i
took
the
reporter
advice
and
made
bad
worse
my
last
shorthand
lesson
was
taken
in
long
after
i
had
ceased
to
think
of
journalism
as
a
profession
indeed
i
can
not
now
remember
why
i
continued
to
waste
my
time
over
a
craft
that
i
could
not
master
but
i
suppose
i
thought
the
endeavour
gave
an
air
of
respectability
and
solidity
to
my
proceedings
that
they
would
have
lacked
without
it
from
june
to
december
i
was
more
or
less
vaguely
bent
on
the
journalist
career
i
remember
feeling
somewhat
discouraged
during
this
period
by
reading
an
advertisement
for
a
journalistic
position
in
a
london
paper
the
applicant
could
write
shorthand
at
the
rate
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
words
a
minute
he
understood
all
about
reporting
he
was
an
expert
at
leaderettes
and
quite
willing
to
take
a
turn
at
the
case
all
for
thirty
shillings
a
week
this
did
not
seem
promising
but
i
need
not
have
disturbed
myself
my
journalistic
days
were
not
yet
nor
for
many
years
to
come
in
the
meanwhile
i
read
variously
and
became
thoroughly
familiar
with
boswell
johnson
in
percy
fitzgerald
edition
and
one
windy
gusty
night
when
the
costers
flares
in
the
back
streets
were
burning
with
a
rushing
sound
i
came
upon
a
secondhand
bookshop
on
the
main
road
between
hammersmith
and
turnham
green
and
went
in
and
found
an
odd
volume
of
william
morris
earthly
paradise
now
followed
the
old
trouble
and
in
a
worse
form
as
swinburne
songs
before
sunrise
had
first
set
me
versifying
so
the
earthly
paradise
reinforced
the
original
virus
and
now
i
had
acquired
some
slight
facility
of
a
worthless
sort
and
so
i
began
to
imitate
william
morris
and
spent
the
odd
hours
of
six
good
months
in
writing
a
tale
in
rhymed
couplets
which
i
tore
up
thirty
years
ago
and
then
i
discovered
herrick
and
tried
to
imitate
that
inimitable
writer
but
this
effort
though
vain
in
itself
was
not
so
wholly
vain
for
it
brought
me
as
it
were
into
the
seventeenth
century
into
an
age
which
i
have
loved
ever
since
with
a
peculiar
devotion
ten
years
later
i
went
on
pilgrimage
to
dean
prior
and
dean
churchtown
and
in
spite
of
the
restored
church
trod
the
lanes
under
the
moor
with
reverence
since
herrick
feet
had
passed
by
those
ways
but
now
towards
the
end
of
the
year
after
i
had
known
london
on
and
off
for
nearly
two
and
a
half
years
all
that
feeling
of
its
immense
gaiety
with
which
i
had
approached
it
in
the
first
place
was
dropping
from
me
i
began
to
realise
very
gradually
and
by
dismal
degrees
that
the
gaieties
of
london
were
commodities
that
had
to
be
bought
with
money
and
that
i
had
none
the
theatre
had
ceased
to
charm
me
and
i
am
very
sorry
to
say
that
it
has
never
charmed
me
since
that
is
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
man
sitting
in
the
pit
by
the
end
of
i
had
quite
definitely
ceased
to
be
fond
of
the
play
for
now
london
began
to
assume
for
me
its
terrible
aspect
it
was
rather
a
goblin
castle
than
a
city
of
delights
if
indeed
it
had
not
become
a
place
of
punishment
wherein
i
was
condemned
to
hard
labour
through
many
dreary
and
hopeless
years
in
that
wonderful
volume
which
is
called
the
grand
saint
graal
we
are
told
how
the
hermit
nasciens
received
a
magic
book
from
paradise
it
was
divided
into
portions
and
one
of
these
portions
was
intituled
here
begin
terrors
i
can
find
no
words
that
might
more
fitly
introduce
the
tale
of
my
solitary
life
in
london
i
was
only
twenty
i
was
poor
i
was
desolate
and
i
frizzled
all
the
time
or
most
of
it
on
the
fire
of
my
own
futility
i
longed
to
make
literature
and
i
could
only
write
nonsense
i
was
employed
for
a
time
in
a
house
of
business
in
a
street
north
of
the
strand
and
parallel
to
it
which
i
suppose
must
have
been
chandos
street
i
know
that
it
was
still
paved
with
my
employers
were
publishers
the
firm
has
for
many
years
ceased
to
exist
and
i
was
something
or
other
in
what
is
called
the
editorial
department
but
to
the
best
of
my
belief
publishing
books
was
but
a
minor
part
of
the
energies
of
the
house
and
i
should
think
a
later
growth
the
real
staple
was
wholesale
stationery
there
was
an
important
line
of
copybooks
there
was
a
great
deal
done
with
ornamental
and
decorated
albums
and
also
with
pictorial
calendars
the
shakespeare
calendar
of
the
house
is
still
in
existence
or
was
in
existence
a
year
or
two
ago
and
it
bears
the
name
of
the
vanished
firm
afterwards
sir
walter
besant
had
been
the
editor
of
chandos
and
but
just
before
i
made
my
first
trial
of
business
life
he
had
resigned
and
his
place
was
taken
by
a
very
kindly
literary
gentleman
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
afterwards
he
edited
a
series
if
not
several
series
of
anthologies
and
was
i
believe
appointed
professor
of
english
literature
at
some
indian
seminary
of
learning
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
still
alive
well
it
was
my
business
to
assist
this
gentleman
i
think
i
was
engaged
as
his
secretary
but
i
was
known
in
the
house
as
his
clurk
i
am
trying
to
recollect
what
i
actually
did
to
assist
him
my
first
job
on
the
morning
of
my
arrival
i
can
remember
i
made
a
copy
of
gladstone
latin
version
of
the
hymn
rock
of
ages
jesu
pro
me
perforatus
it
began
and
then
i
had
to
take
down
in
shorthand
and
afterwards
write
in
longhand
a
stern
letter
to
somebody
who
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
name
of
king
alfred
grandmother
this
error
had
occurred
in
one
of
a
series
of
board
school
history
books
that
the
firm
was
publishing
and
this
circumstance
alone
gave
me
a
loathing
and
hatred
for
the
whole
business
since
i
thought
then
and
think
still
that
the
name
of
king
alfred
grandmother
is
not
of
the
faintest
consequence
to
any
reasonable
being
it
is
the
kind
of
fact
which
would
interest
a
german
deeply
he
would
spend
years
of
his
life
to
find
out
all
about
it
but
such
is
not
the
occupation
of
a
gentleman
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
we
became
a
little
livelier
my
chief
contributed
a
london
letter
to
some
scottish
paper
he
came
from
the
northern
part
of
this
island
and
again
my
shorthand
was
required
the
london
letter
was
distinctly
gay
in
its
tone
it
dealt
in
a
cheerful
spirit
with
some
early
incidents
in
the
career
of
a
certain
admirable
actress
whose
talents
then
engaged
and
delighted
us
as
i
took
it
down
it
struck
me
as
over
worldly
for
the
readers
of
the
haddaneuk
herald
and
sure
enough
my
man
reconsidered
the
matter
and
struck
out
the
gaieties
from
the
copy
and
how
did
that
famous
shorthand
of
mine
serve
me
not
so
vilely
considering
all
things
i
had
a
quick
memory
then
and
remembered
many
of
the
phrases
that
had
been
dictated
and
i
could
read
quite
a
lot
of
the
characters
that
i
had
formed
and
others
gave
me
a
vague
sort
of
intimation
of
the
sense
just
as
the
neumes
helped
the
of
the
earlier
ages
they
were
quite
useful
if
you
knew
the
tune
i
search
my
memory
for
further
details
of
my
occupation
with
chandos
and
co
i
think
that
the
shakespeare
calendar
occupied
me
during
odd
hours
for
a
week
or
more
this
was
january
and
i
was
set
to
the
preparation
of
the
calendar
for
the
next
year
it
was
not
a
difficult
task
and
i
was
furnished
with
a
sort
of
album
containing
the
shakespeare
calendars
for
the
past
six
or
seven
years
and
my
only
business
was
to
make
a
new
almanack
out
of
these
old
elements
thus
january
gave
the
shakespearean
quotation
that
had
been
assigned
to
december
for
january
i
chose
a
motto
that
had
pertained
to
february
and
so
forth
it
was
easy
but
dull
and
i
was
dull
too
or
i
would
have
invented
shakespearean
lines
that
shakespeare
never
wrote
and
trusted
to
the
all
but
universal
ignorance
of
shakespeare
i
did
something
like
that
when
i
was
an
older
and
a
merrier
man
i
persuaded
a
friend
of
mine
a
young
fellow
of
literary
tastes
that
one
of
the
most
famous
phrases
ascribed
to
shakespeare
was
in
reality
a
gag
invented
by
benson
stage
manager
do
you
mean
to
say
said
my
friend
that
this
randle
ayrton
invented
poor
thing
but
mine
own
certainly
i
replied
then
said
he
ayrton
must
be
a
most
wonderful
man
and
i
wonder
how
many
of
my
readers
know
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
without
referring
to
the
play
and
then
what
else
did
i
do
for
my
pound
a
week
in
chandos
street
chiefly
i
think
i
took
down
and
transcribed
a
daily
report
to
the
head
office
of
the
firm
which
was
in
belfast
or
dundee
or
some
such
town
i
do
remember
in
the
least
what
it
was
about
whether
it
dealt
with
king
alfred
grandmother
name
or
with
other
matters
but
i
had
to
write
about
two
quarto
pages
daily
of
this
report
and
put
d
in
the
margin
i
think
d
meant
literary
department
but
the
whole
thing
was
the
terror
of
my
life
for
it
had
to
be
neatly
written
with
a
fair
and
level
margin
on
each
side
and
this
i
could
by
no
means
achieve
again
and
again
my
d
was
condemned
as
a
ragged
and
untidy
performance
and
i
had
to
copy
it
out
all
over
again
as
if
i
had
been
a
careless
schoolboy
as
indeed
i
was
from
the
firm
point
of
view
and
i
sit
in
my
corner
trying
to
write
a
round
clear
clerkly
hand
trying
to
remember
that
of
the
two
forms
of
the
small
t
one
was
much
to
be
preferred
trying
to
observe
the
rule
that
today
must
be
written
as
one
word
not
two
and
that
for
commercial
purposes
draft
must
be
spelt
with
f
not
with
ugh
and
thinking
of
the
nightingale
in
the
thorn
bush
by
the
soar
in
the
still
valley
here
i
was
then
in
chandos
street
a
peg
of
no
particular
shape
at
all
in
a
perfectly
round
hole
feeling
very
miserable
indeed
we
were
i
believe
somewhat
cramped
for
room
and
i
had
a
desk
in
the
album
department
here
three
very
cheerful
and
kindly
young
fellows
of
about
my
own
age
did
something
with
handsome
albums
i
do
know
in
the
least
what
they
did
so
far
as
i
could
see
they
took
albums
out
of
tissue
paper
and
put
them
back
into
tissue
paper
all
day
long
one
of
them
the
senior
of
the
room
he
must
have
been
three
or
four
years
older
than
any
of
us
was
just
about
to
make
a
real
start
in
life
he
used
to
tell
me
all
about
it
when
we
were
alone
together
for
a
minute
or
two
as
sometimes
happened
there
was
a
young
lady
whom
he
was
to
marry
in
a
few
months
time
and
he
had
made
arrangements
for
setting
up
as
a
stationer
in
harlesden
and
he
meant
to
push
chandos
stuff
albums
and
everything
and
to
do
well
and
be
happy
poor
man
and
then
he
died
to
quote
one
of
johnson
muttered
undertones
i
do
not
know
how
far
his
short
life
at
harlesden
was
successful
or
felicitous
but
as
for
me
i
hated
it
all
it
was
not
that
the
work
was
hard
but
that
i
took
no
interest
in
it
and
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
be
done
at
all
or
why
anybody
alive
should
do
it
so
i
looked
about
me
and
through
the
favour
of
a
friend
i
got
a
little
teaching
of
small
children
at
shillings
a
week
then
i
gave
notice
to
chandos
they
were
very
kind
they
offered
me
shillings
a
week
to
stay
but
i
thanked
them
and
said
no
it
was
the
business
atmosphere
of
the
place
that
i
detested
i
have
always
agreed
with
the
small
boy
in
nicholas
nickleby
who
uttered
the
great
maxim
never
perform
business
the
teaching
which
followed
was
certainly
not
exciting
but
i
did
not
mind
it
indeed
having
to
teach
euclid
i
found
to
my
amazement
that
it
was
about
something
and
actually
was
a
coherent
and
reasoned
scheme
of
things
not
a
mere
madhouse
puzzle
as
i
had
always
imagined
but
then
my
own
geometrical
instruction
had
been
limited
it
consisted
simply
in
this
fourteen
euclids
were
served
out
to
fourteen
small
boys
the
mathematical
master
then
said
learn
the
definitions
axioms
and
postulates
that
was
my
first
and
my
last
lesson
in
geometry
though
i
duly
went
through
the
accustomed
books
of
euclid
trying
to
learn
by
heart
what
was
to
me
mere
unmeaning
gibberish
at
this
time
and
for
the
next
year
and
a
half
i
was
living
in
clarendon
road
notting
hill
gate
or
holland
park
to
give
the
politer
subdirection
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
had
not
a
garret
since
the
houses
of
that
quarter
being
comparatively
modern
do
not
possess
the
sloping
roofs
which
have
seen
the
miseries
of
so
many
lettered
men
still
my
room
had
its
merits
it
was
of
course
at
the
top
of
the
house
and
it
was
much
smaller
than
any
monastic
cell
that
i
have
ever
seen
from
recollection
i
should
estimate
its
dimensions
as
ten
feet
by
five
it
held
a
bed
a
washstand
a
small
table
and
one
chair
and
so
it
was
very
fortunate
that
i
had
few
visitors
outside
on
the
landing
i
kept
my
big
wooden
box
with
all
my
possessions
and
these
not
many
in
it
and
there
was
a
very
notable
circumstance
about
this
landing
on
the
wall
was
suspended
lengthwise
a
by
which
one
could
climb
through
a
trap
door
to
the
roof
in
case
of
fire
and
so
between
the
rungs
or
steps
of
this
ladder
i
disposed
my
library
for
anything
i
know
the
books
tasted
as
well
thus
housed
as
they
did
at
a
later
period
when
i
kept
them
in
an
bookcase
of
noble
dark
mahogany
behind
glass
doors
there
was
no
fireplace
in
my
room
and
i
was
often
very
cold
i
would
sit
in
my
shabby
old
reading
or
writing
and
if
i
were
writing
i
would
every
now
and
then
stand
up
and
warm
my
hands
over
the
to
prevent
my
fingers
getting
numb
i
remember
envying
a
man
very
much
indeed
on
a
certain
night
in
late
winter
or
early
spring
it
was
a
very
cold
night
there
was
a
bitter
blowing
and
the
wind
seemed
to
pierce
right
through
my
old
coat
and
to
set
my
very
bones
shivering
and
aching
i
had
gone
abroad
because
i
was
weary
of
my
den
because
i
was
sick
with
reading
and
in
no
humour
for
writing
because
i
felt
i
must
have
some
change
however
slight
but
it
was
an
evil
and
a
bitter
blast
so
i
turned
back
after
a
little
while
coming
down
one
of
the
steep
streets
that
lead
from
notting
hill
gate
station
to
clarendon
road
and
home
i
came
upon
a
man
encamped
on
the
road
by
the
pavement
he
was
watching
over
some
barrows
and
tools
and
other
instruments
of
street
repair
and
he
sat
in
a
sort
of
canvas
wigwam
well
sheltered
from
the
wind
that
was
chilling
me
to
the
heart
his
coat
too
looked
thick
and
heavy
and
he
had
a
warm
comforter
round
his
neck
and
before
him
was
a
glowing
ardent
brazier
of
coals
he
held
his
hands
and
his
nose
over
the
radiant
heat
and
smoked
a
black
clay
pipe
and
i
think
he
had
a
can
of
beer
beside
him
i
envied
that
man
with
all
my
heart
i
do
think
i
have
ever
envied
any
man
so
much
occasionally
i
had
applications
for
the
loan
of
a
book
from
my
library
these
came
from
the
lodgers
on
the
ground
floor
an
armenian
and
his
wife
who
annoyed
the
landlady
by
sleeping
in
cushions
piled
about
the
carpet
and
hanging
their
blankets
in
front
of
the
doors
and
windows
it
was
the
armenian
lady
who
had
literary
tastes
and
her
desire
was
always
for
a
i
never
saw
her
or
her
husband
but
i
often
heard
him
calling
mary
the
servant
he
would
stand
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
and
shout
marry
marry
and
then
reflectively
and
after
a
short
interval
damn
that
girl
he
gave
a
fine
oriental
force
to
the
common
english
damn
other
lodgers
that
i
remember
were
a
young
greek
and
a
chorus
girl
mates
for
a
single
summer
they
occupied
the
first
floor
and
were
succeeded
by
a
family
from
ireland
i
have
a
confused
notion
that
there
was
something
a
little
queer
about
the
head
of
this
household
he
was
i
think
a
major
and
i
know
he
was
evangelical
as
i
went
down
the
stairs
i
heard
him
more
than
once
uttering
in
loud
earnest
tones
the
words
let
us
pray
this
was
startling
and
one
of
his
daughters
would
always
shut
the
door
of
their
room
with
a
bang
on
these
occasions
and
that
was
startling
too
the
little
table
in
my
little
room
turned
out
to
be
a
very
useful
piece
of
furniture
i
not
only
read
at
it
and
wrote
on
it
but
i
used
it
as
a
larder
in
the
corner
nearest
the
angle
of
the
wall
by
the
window
i
kept
my
provisions
that
is
to
say
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
canister
of
green
tea
morning
and
evening
the
landlady
or
marry
would
bring
me
up
a
tray
on
which
were
a
plate
a
knife
a
teapot
a
cup
and
saucer
and
a
jug
of
hot
water
with
the
aid
of
a
kettle
and
a
spirit
lamp
which
came
i
think
from
under
that
serviceable
table
one
may
fairly
say
from
the
cellar
i
made
the
hot
water
to
boil
and
brewed
a
great
pot
of
strong
green
tea
in
the
first
months
of
this
life
of
mine
an
early
dinner
was
added
to
the
fees
of
my
teaching
later
my
pupils
changed
and
the
dinner
disappeared
i
then
used
to
spend
the
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
day
in
wanderings
about
turnham
green
and
the
waste
places
round
gunnersbury
making
my
meal
on
a
large
captain
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
beer
i
varied
this
repast
by
taking
it
in
various
in
those
days
there
were
still
pleasing
and
ancient
taverns
scattered
along
those
western
roads
one
i
remember
in
particular
a
very
old
tumbledown
house
set
at
the
edge
of
the
market
gardens
which
then
approached
almost
to
turnham
green
there
was
not
a
straight
line
about
this
old
old
house
its
dipped
and
wavered
and
the
roof
was
of
mellowed
tiles
and
one
end
of
the
place
was
quite
overwhelmed
by
a
huge
billow
of
ivy
i
used
to
think
that
highwaymen
must
have
lurked
in
the
little
room
where
i
took
my
biscuit
and
glass
of
ale
and
the
food
and
drink
tasted
much
better
on
that
account
the
old
tavern
and
its
leaning
sheds
and
ragged
outbuildings
its
red
roof
and
its
green
ivy
all
are
gone
long
ago
there
is
a
row
of
raw
houses
where
it
stood
and
i
hate
them
sometimes
i
did
not
have
any
beer
either
because
i
did
not
want
any
or
because
it
struck
me
as
too
great
a
luxury
then
i
would
buy
a
small
bag
of
currant
biscuits
and
take
them
to
the
region
of
the
market
gardens
and
devour
them
sitting
on
a
gate
or
sheltering
behind
a
hedge
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
these
feasts
are
always
connected
in
my
mind
with
a
grey
and
gloomy
sky
and
a
very
cold
wind
so
that
i
shiver
when
i
think
of
flat
square
biscuits
in
which
currants
are
embedded
but
i
have
a
reverence
for
them
too
there
were
i
confess
days
of
gross
debauch
once
a
week
or
once
a
fortnight
at
the
least
i
went
to
a
goodly
and
spacious
and
ancient
tavern
on
the
high
road
and
had
a
grilled
chop
potatoes
bread
and
beer
which
came
to
one
and
a
penny
or
one
and
twopence
cotelettes
de
the
dish
is
called
by
the
experts
of
the
i
can
recommend
it
and
in
the
evenings
i
sometimes
exceeded
though
not
so
violently
i
would
nine
evenings
out
of
ten
buy
my
provision
of
bread
at
a
shop
at
the
bottom
of
the
long
main
road
opposite
or
nearly
opposite
to
uxbridge
road
station
the
shop
kept
a
very
choice
kind
of
gingerbread
and
i
would
buy
a
couple
of
bricks
of
this
gingerbread
and
munch
them
with
a
high
relish
as
a
supplement
to
the
common
bread
as
the
spring
of
advanced
and
the
weather
improved
and
the
evenings
lengthened
i
began
the
habit
of
rambling
abroad
in
the
hope
of
finding
something
that
could
be
called
country
i
would
sometimes
pursue
clarendon
road
northward
and
get
into
all
sorts
of
regions
of
which
i
never
had
any
clear
notion
they
are
obscure
to
me
now
and
a
sort
of
nightmare
i
see
myself
getting
terribly
entangled
with
a
canal
which
seemed
to
cross
my
path
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
laws
of
reason
i
turn
a
corner
and
am
confronted
with
an
awful
cemetery
a
terrible
city
of
white
gravestones
and
shattered
marble
pillars
and
granite
urns
and
every
sort
of
horrid
heathenry
this
i
suppose
must
have
been
kensal
green
it
added
new
terror
to
death
i
think
i
came
upon
kensal
green
again
and
again
it
was
like
the
malay
an
enemy
for
months
i
would
break
off
by
way
of
portobello
road
and
entangle
myself
in
notting
hill
and
presently
i
would
come
upon
the
goblin
city
i
might
wander
into
the
harrow
road
but
at
last
the
would
appal
me
maida
vale
was
treacherous
paddington
false
inevitably
it
seemed
my
path
led
me
to
the
detested
habitation
of
the
dead
be
it
remembered
that
my
horror
at
the
sight
of
kensal
green
cemetery
was
due
to
this
that
odd
as
it
may
seem
to
townsfolk
i
had
never
seen
a
cemetery
before
well
i
knew
the
old
graveyards
of
gwent
solemn
amongst
the
swelling
hills
peaceful
in
the
shadow
of
very
ancient
yews
i
knew
well
these
garths
there
was
henllis
high
up
on
the
mountain
side
in
the
place
of
roaring
winds
under
the
faery
dome
of
twyn
barlwm
i
had
lingered
there
of
autumn
evenings
while
the
sun
set
red
over
the
mountains
and
a
drift
of
rain
came
with
the
gathering
darkness
as
the
yew
boughs
beat
upon
the
east
window
of
the
church
there
were
graves
there
with
flourished
inscriptions
deeply
cut
and
queer
welsh
rhymes
gareg
here
a
rare
stone
of
death
beneath
it
lies
a
rarer
dust
that
shall
arise
by
heavenly
breath
alone
and
climb
the
skies
we
trust
i
knew
the
churchyard
of
llanddewi
looking
down
the
steep
hillside
into
the
chanting
valley
of
the
soar
and
kemeys
between
the
forest
and
the
usk
and
partrishw
in
the
heart
of
the
wild
mountains
beyond
abergavenny
these
places
of
the
dead
were
solemn
with
old
religion
and
the
tones
of
and
and
sang
still
about
them
on
their
hills
but
this
white
ghostly
city
of
corruption
there
was
nothing
but
horror
in
it
still
i
see
myself
on
these
wanderings
beating
to
and
fro
in
the
stony
wilderness
entangled
as
i
say
in
the
endless
mazes
of
unknown
streets
now
i
would
succeed
in
breaking
away
i
would
pass
that
sad
zone
of
destruction
and
disgrace
that
always
lies
just
beyond
the
furthest
points
of
the
suburb
these
are
the
places
where
the
hedges
are
half
ruined
half
remaining
where
the
little
winding
brook
is
defiled
but
not
yet
a
drain
where
one
tree
lies
felled
and
withered
while
its
fellow
is
still
all
green
here
curbstones
impinge
on
the
fields
and
show
where
new
rabid
streets
are
to
rush
up
the
sweet
hillside
and
capture
it
here
the
well
under
the
thorn
is
choked
with
a
cartload
of
cheap
bricks
lately
deposited
i
would
pass
over
these
dismal
regions
and
come
as
i
thought
into
the
fair
open
country
and
then
suddenly
at
the
turn
of
the
lane
i
would
be
confronted
by
red
ranks
of
villas
this
might
be
harlesden
or
the
outposts
of
willesden
i
think
that
on
the
especial
occasion
that
i
have
in
mind
the
red
row
of
houses
must
have
been
some
portion
or
fragment
of
harlesden
i
remember
that
like
the
cemetery
this
impressed
me
as
a
wholly
new
and
unforeseen
horror
something
as
strange
and
terrible
as
the
apparition
of
a
rattlesnake
or
a
might
be
to
an
english
child
wandering
a
little
away
into
the
orchard
or
the
wood
near
the
house
i
had
never
lived
in
a
world
that
might
have
prepared
me
for
such
things
in
gwent
in
my
day
at
all
events
there
was
no
such
phenomenon
as
this
sudden
and
violent
irruption
of
red
brick
in
the
midst
of
a
green
field
and
thus
when
i
came
round
the
corner
of
a
peaceful
lane
and
saw
in
the
midst
of
elms
and
meadows
this
staring
spectacle
i
was
as
aghast
as
robinson
crusoe
when
he
saw
the
track
of
the
foot
on
the
sand
of
his
desert
island
and
here
i
would
make
a
parenthesis
and
say
that
so
long
as
my
writing
habits
had
any
concern
with
the
imagination
i
never
departed
from
the
one
formula
this
not
consciously
in
fact
i
have
a
secret
doctrine
to
the
effect
that
in
literature
no
imaginative
effects
are
achieved
by
logical
predetermination
i
have
told
i
think
how
i
was
confronted
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
with
the
awe
and
solemnity
and
mystery
of
the
valley
of
the
usk
and
of
the
house
called
bartholly
hanging
solitary
between
the
deep
forest
and
the
winding
esses
of
the
river
this
spectacle
remained
in
my
heart
for
years
and
at
last
i
transliterated
it
clumsily
enough
in
the
story
of
the
great
god
pan
which
as
a
friendly
critic
once
said
does
at
least
make
one
believe
in
the
devil
if
it
does
nothing
else
here
of
course
was
my
real
failure
i
translated
awe
at
worst
awfulness
into
evil
again
i
say
one
dreams
in
fire
and
works
in
clay
but
at
all
events
my
method
never
altered
more
legitimately
than
in
the
instance
of
the
great
god
pan
i
made
the
horrid
apparition
of
the
crude
new
houses
in
the
midst
of
green
pastures
the
seed
of
my
tale
the
inmost
light
which
was
originally
bound
up
with
the
great
god
pan
and
so
the
man
in
my
story
resting
in
green
fields
looked
up
and
saw
a
face
that
chilled
his
blood
gazing
at
him
from
the
back
of
one
of
those
red
houses
that
once
had
frightened
me
when
i
was
a
sorry
lad
of
twenty
wandering
about
the
verges
of
london
the
doctor
of
my
tale
lived
in
harlesden
and
if
i
may
pursue
this
subject
farther
i
would
suggest
that
the
whole
matter
of
imaginative
literature
depends
upon
this
faculty
of
seeing
the
universe
from
the
æonian
pebble
of
the
wayside
to
the
raw
suburban
street
as
something
new
unheard
of
marvellous
finally
miraculous
the
good
people
amongst
whom
i
naturally
class
myself
feel
that
everything
is
miraculous
they
are
continually
amazed
at
the
strangeness
of
the
proportion
of
all
things
the
bad
people
or
scientists
as
they
are
sometimes
called
maintain
that
nothing
is
properly
an
object
of
awe
or
wonder
since
everything
can
be
explained
they
are
duly
punished
if
we
go
more
deeply
into
this
text
of
horror
and
harlesden
it
will
become
apparent
i
think
that
what
is
called
genius
is
not
only
of
many
varying
degrees
of
intensity
but
also
very
distinctly
of
two
parts
or
functions
there
is
the
passive
side
of
genius
that
faculty
which
is
amazed
by
the
strange
mysterious
admirable
spectacle
of
the
world
which
is
enchanted
and
rapt
out
of
our
common
airs
by
hints
and
omens
of
an
adorable
beauty
everywhere
latent
beneath
the
veil
of
appearance
now
i
think
that
every
man
or
almost
every
man
is
born
with
the
potentiality
at
all
events
of
this
function
of
genius
homini
sublime
dedit
coelumque
man
as
distinct
from
the
other
animals
carries
his
head
on
high
so
that
he
may
look
upon
the
heavens
and
i
think
that
we
may
say
that
this
sentence
has
an
interior
as
well
as
an
exterior
meaning
the
beasts
look
downward
to
the
earth
not
only
in
the
letter
but
in
the
spirit
they
are
creatures
of
material
sensation
living
by
far
the
greatest
part
of
their
lives
in
a
world
of
hot
and
cold
hunger
and
thirst
and
satisfaction
man
on
the
other
hand
is
by
his
nature
designed
to
look
upward
to
gaze
into
the
heavens
that
are
all
about
him
to
discern
the
eternal
in
things
temporal
or
as
the
priestess
of
the
holy
bottle
defines
and
distinguishes
the
beasts
are
made
to
drink
water
but
men
to
drink
wine
this
the
receptive
or
passive
part
of
genius
is
i
say
given
to
every
human
being
at
least
potentially
we
receive
each
one
of
us
the
magic
bean
and
if
we
will
plant
it
it
will
undoubtedly
grow
and
become
our
ladder
to
the
stars
and
the
cloud
castles
unfortunately
the
modern
process
so
oddly
named
civilisation
is
as
killing
to
this
kind
of
gardening
as
the
canker
to
the
rose
and
thus
it
is
that
if
i
want
a
really
nice
chair
i
must
either
buy
a
chair
that
is
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
or
else
a
careful
copy
or
replica
of
such
a
chair
it
may
appear
strange
to
tottenham
court
road
and
the
modern
furniture
trade
but
it
is
none
the
less
true
that
you
can
not
design
so
much
as
a
nice
unless
you
have
gone
a
little
way
at
all
events
up
the
magic
beanstalk
still
many
of
us
have
our
portion
of
the
passive
or
perceptive
faculty
of
genius
we
are
moved
by
the
wonder
of
the
world
we
know
ourselves
as
citizens
of
an
incredible
city
we
catch
stray
glimpses
of
faery
atlantis
drowned
beneath
the
ocean
of
sense
but
it
is
one
thing
to
dream
dreams
and
quite
another
to
interpret
them
and
in
this
active
faculty
of
interpretation
or
translation
of
the
heavenly
tongues
into
earthly
speech
there
are
infinite
degrees
of
excellence
and
the
masters
in
this
craft
of
interpretation
are
few
indeed
and
the
final
conclusion
a
sad
one
for
me
is
that
if
i
could
have
translated
the
horror
of
harlesden
competently
i
should
have
been
a
man
of
genius
still
i
see
myself
all
through
that
year
tramping
loafing
strolling
along
interminable
streets
and
roads
lying
to
the
and
the
west
of
london
a
shabby
sorry
figure
and
always
alone
i
remember
walking
to
hendon
and
back
this
must
have
been
on
a
whole
holiday
and
to
this
day
i
ca
think
how
i
found
my
way
there
through
what
clues
i
struck
from
the
north
parts
of
clarendon
road
into
the
harrow
road
and
how
i
knew
when
to
leave
the
edgware
road
and
bend
to
the
right
anyhow
i
got
there
and
back
tired
enough
and
glad
of
the
of
bread
that
awaited
me
then
i
became
learned
in
wormwood
scrubs
and
its
possibilities
it
was
and
is
a
very
barren
and
bleak
place
itself
but
in
those
days
there
was
an
attractive
corner
on
the
acton
side
of
the
waste
that
i
was
fond
of
contemplating
this
was
a
sort
of
huddle
of
old
cottages
and
barns
and
outhouses
with
a
fringe
of
elms
about
them
it
did
my
eyes
good
then
as
now
to
look
on
something
that
was
old
and
worn
with
use
and
mellow
my
eyes
that
were
bleared
and
aching
with
the
rawness
and
newness
of
multitudinous
london
to
me
an
old
cottage
with
its
little
latticed
porch
and
its
tangled
garden
patch
was
veritable
balm
i
would
gaze
on
such
a
place
with
refreshment
and
delight
as
desert
travellers
must
gaze
on
the
cold
pools
and
green
leafage
of
an
unexpected
oasis
i
used
to
light
on
these
little
humble
pleasant
retreats
in
my
walks
there
were
many
more
of
such
cottages
in
the
outskirts
of
london
then
than
now
and
make
impossible
plans
for
migrating
from
the
urbanity
of
clarendon
road
into
one
of
these
hidden
places
where
there
would
be
a
garden
for
me
to
walk
in
and
perhaps
a
overgrown
with
white
roses
and
a
little
low
room
with
oldish
furniture
but
i
found
no
such
place
and
still
went
prowling
in
a
kind
of
torment
of
the
spirit
by
the
highways
and
of
the
west
acton
used
to
do
me
good
it
was
then
more
like
a
country
town
than
a
modern
suburb
on
the
right
hand
as
you
came
up
from
the
uxbridge
road
under
the
railway
bridge
there
were
then
some
grave
and
dignified
houses
of
the
early
georgian
period
with
broad
lawns
before
them
and
big
gardens
behind
them
on
the
left
was
the
priory
with
spacious
and
grounds
and
many
greeny
elms
legends
about
the
first
lord
lytton
hung
about
the
priory
and
it
was
whispered
that
the
old
lady
who
kept
the
had
in
her
day
written
daring
poetry
of
the
erotic
kind
there
are
laundries
and
rows
and
rows
of
little
houses
now
where
the
priory
stood
the
georgian
houses
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
have
all
been
pulled
down
but
i
have
a
notion
that
the
last
time
i
went
that
way
i
saw
a
bookshop
on
the
london
side
of
the
railway
bridge
where
in
i
bought
an
old
odd
volume
of
cowley
poems
the
bookshop
which
includes
the
bookstall
is
one
of
the
many
things
that
i
have
dabbled
in
but
i
have
never
been
sworn
to
the
hunt
over
the
old
shelves
as
to
a
devouring
passion
i
lack
the
great
incentive
the
love
of
rare
books
on
account
of
their
rarity
i
have
a
great
respect
for
the
collector
of
such
things
and
i
often
envy
him
his
sudden
joys
of
discovery
it
must
be
like
finding
a
golden
treasure
in
a
rubbish
heap
but
i
could
never
follow
his
example
still
i
often
used
to
amuse
myself
by
grubbing
about
the
dusty
shelves
for
an
odd
hour
or
two
turning
over
vast
masses
of
insignificance
of
insignificance
for
me
at
all
events
conning
titles
diving
into
prefaces
glancing
doubtfully
over
strange
pages
wondering
whether
this
or
that
or
the
other
would
bring
me
the
best
entertainment
for
the
few
shillings
that
i
had
to
spend
in
these
new
days
the
young
man
with
a
thirst
for
literature
has
his
labours
simplified
the
classics
of
the
world
are
ready
for
him
nicely
printed
in
a
handy
form
and
at
a
low
price
he
has
simply
to
go
into
a
shop
put
down
his
shilling
and
get
his
book
and
it
is
all
over
this
would
never
have
done
for
me
when
i
bought
a
book
i
required
and
obtained
a
long
deliberated
pleasure
i
considered
that
the
possession
of
or
five
shillings
entitled
me
to
a
whole
afternoon
rich
enjoyment
just
as
ladies
of
the
suburbs
make
arrangements
as
i
understand
to
come
up
to
town
and
do
a
little
shopping
and
have
a
delicate
or
two
in
regent
street
and
then
go
to
a
matinée
at
the
theatre
and
have
creamy
cakes
for
tea
before
they
start
back
for
the
red
villas
so
did
i
use
to
travel
from
notting
hill
gate
to
charing
cross
and
stroll
up
villiers
street
and
walk
along
the
strand
relishing
its
savours
which
never
grew
stale
to
me
for
i
do
believe
that
the
old
strand
before
they
destroyed
it
with
their
porphyries
and
their
marbles
and
babylonian
fooleries
and
façades
of
all
sorts
was
the
very
finest
street
in
all
the
world
i
know
quite
well
its
manifest
and
manifold
weaknesses
and
faults
if
it
were
to
be
regarded
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
classical
there
was
no
plan
no
design
about
it
no
uniformity
its
houses
were
of
all
shapes
sizes
periods
and
heights
it
had
no
more
been
designed
than
a
wild
hedgerow
has
been
designed
and
there
exactly
was
its
infinite
and
subtle
and
curious
charm
nothing
could
be
more
urban
or
urbane
than
the
strand
and
yet
it
had
grown
as
the
green
brake
grows
as
the
cathedrals
and
the
country
houses
of
england
grew
from
age
to
age
gathering
beauty
as
they
increased
the
strand
was
an
altogether
english
street
and
it
was
the
very
heart
of
london
in
it
or
beside
it
were
the
theatres
and
the
bookshops
and
the
cookshops
to
north
and
south
odd
passages
and
stairs
and
archways
admitted
the
curious
into
the
oddest
places
and
quarters
you
were
weary
of
the
traffic
and
the
pattering
feet
then
you
could
turn
into
new
inn
or
clement
inn
and
enjoy
deep
silence
you
wanted
to
see
the
old
of
the
london
back
streets
dark
taverns
of
the
eighteenth
century
where
men
had
lain
hidden
from
the
hangman
here
was
clare
market
for
you
you
had
heard
that
elzevirs
were
very
rare
and
curious
books
and
would
like
to
see
an
elzevir
you
would
lose
your
opinion
of
their
rarity
for
you
would
see
as
many
elzevirs
as
any
man
could
desire
in
holywell
street
where
i
believe
they
were
to
be
bought
by
the
sack
as
if
they
had
been
coals
and
elzevirs
apart
the
naughty
prints
and
books
of
holywell
street
were
as
good
as
a
play
for
i
believe
that
the
row
had
turned
naughty
somewhere
in
the
early
it
had
then
got
in
its
stocks
and
had
kept
them
here
were
the
works
of
reynolds
in
large
volumes
mysteries
of
the
court
of
james
and
such
weariness
here
was
the
faded
coloured
engraving
of
a
young
female
of
extreme
gaiety
with
ringlets
and
the
appearance
of
the
chambermaid
in
the
print
sherry
sir
and
with
all
the
curiosity
and
variety
and
oddity
and
richness
of
the
strand
it
had
the
while
a
manner
of
snug
homeliness
and
cosiness
and
comfort
about
it
which
was
quite
inimitable
to
be
in
the
strand
was
like
drinking
punch
and
reading
dickens
one
felt
it
was
such
a
warmhearted
hospitable
street
if
one
only
had
a
little
money
unfortunately
i
was
never
on
dining
terms
as
it
were
with
the
strand
but
i
always
felt
that
if
it
only
knew
me
it
would
have
called
me
old
boy
and
given
me
its
choicest
saddles
of
mutton
and
its
oldest
port
and
i
felt
grateful
somehow
i
always
warmed
my
hands
when
i
got
into
the
strand
and
they
were
often
chilly
enough
such
then
was
my
preparation
for
a
in
the
heart
of
london
this
relished
leisurely
savoury
walk
along
the
strand
and
then
i
might
dive
into
clare
market
by
clement
inn
and
look
for
mystery
books
in
a
certain
shop
that
i
knew
there
i
bought
one
of
the
most
curious
i
do
not
say
the
best
books
in
the
world
vaughan
lumen
de
lumine
in
a
shop
in
clare
market
and
still
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
someone
would
tell
me
what
lumen
de
lumine
is
about
or
i
might
try
denny
at
the
western
end
of
booksellers
row
or
like
enough
go
grovelling
round
the
shelves
of
reeves
and
turner
who
were
then
in
the
southern
bend
of
the
strand
opposite
to
clement
dane
church
one
dull
afternoon
i
remember
i
ran
to
earth
in
this
shop
on
a
lower
shelf
a
dim
brown
book
in
cloth
covers
called
ferrier
institutes
of
metaphysic
it
repaid
me
many
times
over
for
the
couple
of
shillings
that
i
gave
for
it
i
took
ferrier
home
in
delight
to
the
little
room
in
clarendon
road
and
made
a
great
deal
of
green
tea
and
found
the
dry
bread
of
quite
admirable
flavour
and
smoked
pipes
and
read
the
new
book
far
into
the
night
before
i
went
to
bed
ferrier
had
quite
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
the
proposition
which
looked
odd
at
first
that
we
can
only
be
ignorant
of
that
which
we
can
know
this
means
of
course
that
no
man
can
be
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
triangles
which
is
evident
enough
but
as
i
fell
asleep
i
felt
i
had
had
a
tremendous
day
i
look
back
upon
myself
in
that
little
room
in
clarendon
road
with
some
amazement
i
come
in
from
one
of
my
long
prowling
walks
i
may
have
been
to
hounslow
to
look
for
the
heath
or
i
may
have
been
to
hampton
court
and
make
my
meal
of
bread
and
tea
and
then
settle
down
to
tobacco
and
literature
i
find
that
my
landlady
turns
off
the
gas
at
the
meter
at
midnight
so
i
provide
myself
with
carriage
candles
which
i
fix
up
somehow
on
the
table
i
read
on
night
after
night
it
may
be
homer
odyssey
or
it
may
be
don
quixote
to
which
i
have
been
faithful
ever
since
i
found
the
book
in
the
of
llanfrechfa
rectory
it
may
be
that
singular
magazine
of
oddities
curiosities
of
literature
it
may
be
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
a
great
refuge
this
last
a
world
of
literature
in
itself
or
i
am
reading
pepys
for
the
first
time
with
ravishment
or
pomponius
mela
de
situ
orbis
in
a
noble
stephanus
quarto
or
harris
hermes
or
hargrave
jennings
on
the
rosicrucians
this
last
one
of
the
craziest
and
most
entertaining
of
books
which
had
a
little
later
an
odd
influence
on
my
fortunes
it
was
a
sad
blow
to
me
to
find
out
afterwards
chiefly
through
the
medium
of
waite
real
history
of
the
rosicrucians
that
as
a
cold
matter
of
fact
there
were
no
rosicrucians
a
lutheran
pastor
who
had
read
paracelsus
wrote
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
pamphlet
describing
a
secret
order
which
had
no
existence
outside
of
his
brain
naturally
enough
societies
arose
which
imitated
so
far
as
they
could
the
imaginary
organisation
described
by
the
fantastic
johannes
valentinus
andrea
i
should
not
be
surprised
indeed
to
be
told
that
such
societies
are
now
in
being
in
modern
london
but
these
orders
are
late
fakes
the
and
of
the
last
century
saw
their
beginnings
there
are
no
rosicrucians
and
there
never
were
any
or
i
am
reading
carlyle
sartor
resartus
or
the
johnson
and
burns
and
walter
scott
essays
and
i
must
say
that
i
think
a
good
many
young
men
of
this
age
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
carlyle
course
for
though
carlyle
was
not
the
prophet
of
full
inspiration
that
the
time
just
before
my
own
imagined
though
he
exalted
brute
force
into
a
place
that
belongs
to
the
divine
wisdom
though
his
original
calvinism
hung
like
a
dark
and
obscuring
cloud
over
all
his
life
yet
i
know
not
any
man
of
these
days
that
is
worthy
to
dust
carlyle
hat
or
to
clean
his
pipe
for
him
there
is
a
passage
in
the
johnson
essay
telling
how
the
poor
agonised
heroic
doctor
made
for
himself
a
boat
of
the
transient
driftwood
and
enduring
iron
and
sailed
down
fleet
ditch
the
roaring
mother
of
dead
dogs
to
the
city
that
hath
foundations
the
phrases
ring
still
in
my
heart
noble
music
worthier
stuff
than
the
prophecies
of
or
should
i
say
of
yesterday
these
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
bid
us
abstain
from
meat
and
beer
and
tobacco
and
the
state
shall
give
us
a
pound
a
day
and
save
our
souls
alive
this
message
does
not
ring
in
my
heart
a
noble
music
i
think
carlyle
would
have
called
it
a
damned
potato
gospel
i
read
carlyle
then
in
my
little
room
and
find
a
strange
encouragement
and
strength
in
him
his
picture
of
life
is
of
a
bitter
struggle
and
so
indeed
i
find
it
at
twenty
man
in
carlyle
is
a
poor
wretch
in
thin
and
ragged
clothes
out
on
a
blasted
heath
with
all
the
heavens
and
all
the
clouds
crashing
and
pouring
upon
him
blackness
over
him
hailstorms
and
fire
showers
his
portion
in
the
world
get
into
whatever
kennel
or
doghole
you
can
find
says
carlyle
and
shelter
yourself
from
the
blast
so
long
as
you
can
keep
it
and
be
thankful
i
liked
the
doctrine
then
and
it
still
seems
to
me
a
very
good
philosophy
so
i
read
and
meditated
night
after
night
and
i
am
amazed
at
the
utter
loneliness
of
it
all
when
i
contrast
this
life
of
mine
with
the
beginnings
of
other
men
of
letters
these
others
have
often
gathered
friends
of
all
sorts
both
useful
and
pleasant
at
the
university
they
have
come
of
stocks
every
step
they
take
is
eased
for
them
their
way
is
pointed
out
there
are
hands
to
help
them
over
the
rough
and
difficult
places
or
even
if
they
have
not
been
at
oxford
or
cambridge
if
they
have
not
come
of
kent
folk
they
know
somehow
or
other
young
fellows
of
their
own
age
with
whom
they
can
engage
in
endless
talk
about
letters
over
eternal
pipes
and
tankards
one
informs
another
one
consciously
or
unconsciously
charts
the
other
way
for
him
i
am
often
made
quite
envious
when
i
see
and
hear
how
a
young
man
fresh
on
the
town
drops
so
easily
so
pleasantly
so
delightfully
into
a
quite
distinguished
place
in
literature
before
he
is
he
enters
the
world
of
letters
as
a
perfectly
man
enters
a
room
full
of
a
great
and
distinguished
company
knowing
exactly
what
to
say
and
how
to
say
it
everyone
is
charmed
to
see
him
he
is
at
home
at
once
and
almost
a
classic
in
a
year
or
two
and
i
all
alone
in
my
little
room
friendless
desolate
conscious
to
my
very
heart
of
my
stuttering
awkwardness
whenever
i
thought
of
attempting
the
great
speech
of
literature
wandering
bewildered
in
the
world
of
imagination
not
knowing
whither
i
went
feeling
my
way
like
a
blind
man
stumbling
like
a
blind
man
like
a
blind
man
striking
my
head
against
the
wall
for
me
no
help
no
friends
no
counsel
no
comfort
somehow
or
other
out
of
a
welter
of
reading
of
the
most
miscellaneous
and
shapeless
sort
out
of
long
walks
and
long
meditations
out
of
moonings
and
loafings
by
brentford
and
the
parts
thereto
adjacent
there
rose
up
in
the
spring
of
the
beginnings
of
something
that
had
a
vague
resemblance
to
a
book
i
had
finished
that
miserable
poem
which
attempted
the
manner
of
william
morris
and
from
that
time
my
attacks
of
became
brief
and
trifling
causing
no
uneasiness
and
this
trouble
happily
over
i
became
immersed
in
the
study
of
scholastic
logic
and
gave
many
days
and
nights
to
whately
elements
i
got
thomson
also
and
dallied
with
the
quantification
of
the
predicate
but
i
found
such
devices
too
what
i
wanted
was
the
logic
of
the
mediæval
schools
and
in
this
i
took
a
singular
and
intense
delight
and
here
is
a
paradox
which
may
be
worthy
the
consideration
of
the
curious
that
age
which
was
above
all
the
age
of
logic
was
also
the
age
of
the
most
luxuriant
and
splendid
imagination
the
scholars
and
thinkers
of
the
middle
ages
have
been
reproached
with
idolising
the
logical
process
to
a
point
of
utter
extravagance
with
treating
the
syllogism
as
a
sort
of
divining
rod
by
which
all
the
treasures
of
the
spiritual
intellectual
and
physical
worlds
could
be
discovered
and
drawn
up
from
the
dark
womb
and
chaos
of
things
into
the
light
of
the
sun
these
reproaches
i
think
have
chiefly
proceeded
from
people
to
whom
exact
thinking
has
proved
unpleasant
and
unprofitable
but
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
logical
art
was
deeply
and
profoundly
and
constantly
studied
in
the
thirteenth
century
which
was
the
age
of
the
marvellous
imagery
the
great
magistry
of
the
gothic
cathedrals
of
the
arthurian
romances
of
dante
nay
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
coleridge
and
de
quincey
two
main
agents
of
the
renascence
of
wonder
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
were
both
practised
logicians
it
would
seem
therefore
that
the
dream
and
the
syllogism
have
between
them
a
certain
secret
alliance
and
bond
and
so
naturally
enough
two
of
the
most
extravagant
dreams
alice
in
wonderland
and
alice
through
the
were
the
visions
of
a
master
of
logic
as
for
the
snark
i
can
inform
the
inquisitive
as
to
his
true
abode
he
dwells
in
the
place
that
is
called
bocardo
and
so
i
steeped
myself
in
these
rare
and
entrancing
studies
for
such
they
seemed
and
still
seem
to
me
and
thus
i
would
sit
on
a
bench
on
that
bald
arid
detestable
shepherd
bush
green
and
be
in
reality
though
not
in
actuality
let
us
for
the
moment
adapt
our
discourse
to
the
matter
and
make
the
distinction
in
cool
grey
cloisters
of
the
middle
ages
walking
in
the
silvery
light
with
the
master
of
the
sentences
with
the
angelic
doctor
listening
to
the
high
interminable
argument
of
the
schools
high
indeed
as
dealing
with
immortal
essences
not
with
monkeys
guts
interminable
also
in
the
manner
of
the
cathedral
rushing
upwards
to
the
stars
which
it
can
not
attain
of
the
old
modes
in
which
there
are
no
true
closes
but
rather
hints
of
undying
melodies
far
beyond
their
endings
interminable
according
to
the
dictum
of
one
of
these
masters
exeunt
in
for
there
is
a
quest
to
which
there
is
no
term
nor
bound
nor
limit
meditating
these
things
the
jangling
of
the
old
horse
trams
might
disturb
me
and
i
would
carry
my
quiddities
to
green
fields
by
hanger
hill
or
to
solitary
places
in
osterley
park
beyond
brentford
and
so
muse
till
the
shadows
came
and
sent
me
homeward
under
the
twinkling
wavering
lamps
of
those
days
then
for
much
tobacco
the
disjunctive
hypothetical
syllogism
and
the
strict
rigour
of
the
game
i
am
afraid
very
little
of
the
old
science
has
remained
with
me
but
now
and
then
i
come
with
some
amusement
on
distinguished
personages
engaged
in
what
they
suppose
is
argument
i
see
no
arguments
but
undistributed
middle
terms
are
thick
as
october
leaves
in
wentwood
from
such
a
soil
then
the
thing
that
had
certain
resemblances
to
a
book
rose
up
and
gradually
took
shape
so
far
as
it
ever
had
any
shape
it
came
up
out
of
my
logic
books
and
out
of
burton
anatomy
of
melancholy
and
so
it
was
called
the
anatomy
of
tankards
for
having
enough
sense
even
though
i
was
only
twenty
to
know
that
i
could
not
write
a
serious
treatise
concerning
the
high
doctrines
that
entranced
me
i
wrote
a
grave
burlesque
of
what
i
loved
i
examined
into
the
essence
of
the
tankard
i
sought
deeply
into
its
quiddity
i
divided
its
properties
from
its
accidents
and
distinguished
again
between
the
separable
and
inseparable
accidents
i
showed
philosophically
and
conclusively
that
if
there
were
no
tankards
there
would
be
no
men
that
is
no
rational
or
civilised
men
for
the
ancient
greeks
truly
taught
that
man
was
raised
from
the
brutish
to
the
spiritual
state
by
bacchus
the
giver
of
the
vine
by
wine
is
man
made
divine
and
a
diviner
says
bacbuc
and
since
wine
must
be
contained
before
it
can
be
drunk
it
is
clear
that
without
tankards
man
can
not
become
divine
that
is
can
not
be
man
at
all
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
term
and
so
on
and
so
on
with
an
infinite
deal
of
easy
dictionary
learning
with
much
twisting
of
my
logic
formulæ
it
was
all
too
elaborate
elephantine
prolonged
a
little
thing
that
might
have
been
well
enough
in
its
way
drawn
out
into
a
big
thing
and
so
spoiled
still
i
was
only
twenty
and
twenty
is
apt
to
worry
its
bone
long
after
all
the
meat
has
disappeared
but
if
i
could
only
have
written
the
real
book
that
is
the
dreamed
intended
book
and
not
the
actual
book
then
i
promise
you
you
should
have
had
high
fantasies
not
only
arguments
that
began
with
a
pebble
by
the
way
and
rose
upward
to
the
evening
star
that
deduced
all
the
shining
worlds
in
an
ineffable
sorites
from
one
mere
letter
of
the
alphabet
you
should
not
only
have
been
in
at
the
death
when
achilles
caught
at
last
the
tortoise
and
passed
him
by
spurning
his
body
into
that
utter
void
where
parallel
straight
lines
meet
you
should
have
had
an
english
rabelais
i
remember
taking
my
thoughts
of
the
book
up
to
ealing
common
one
autumn
evening
the
work
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
i
stood
meditating
the
matter
looking
from
the
height
down
towards
brentford
there
was
a
wild
sunset
scarlet
and
green
and
gold
and
as
it
were
gardens
of
persian
roses
far
in
the
evening
sky
i
stood
by
an
old
twisted
oak
and
thought
of
my
book
as
i
would
have
made
it
and
sighed
and
so
went
home
and
made
it
as
i
could
the
kind
of
life
that
i
have
been
trying
to
indicate
lasted
for
about
eighteen
months
and
then
my
pupils
mysteriously
disappeared
mysteriously
i
say
for
i
have
completely
forgotten
what
became
of
them
and
by
what
ways
they
left
me
at
all
events
they
vanished
and
i
being
destitute
returned
to
gwent
and
my
old
home
there
they
were
almost
as
poor
as
poverty
but
they
were
glad
to
see
me
and
i
waking
in
the
morning
to
the
brave
breath
from
the
mountain
wandering
in
the
sunshine
it
was
about
the
gardens
and
the
orchards
revisiting
the
green
delicious
heart
of
the
twisted
brake
listening
once
more
to
the
water
bubbling
from
the
rock
i
thought
i
had
been
translated
from
hell
to
paradise
for
be
it
remembered
i
have
dealt
gently
with
the
days
of
clarendon
road
i
have
spoken
for
the
most
part
of
the
happier
hours
of
eager
reading
of
finding
an
enchanting
book
on
dusty
shelves
on
the
delights
of
the
mind
on
the
capacity
of
changing
dreary
common
shepherd
bush
into
the
cloistered
walks
of
the
schools
on
the
joy
of
obtaining
some
kind
of
literary
utterance
i
have
said
little
of
the
black
days
and
the
waste
nights
of
the
desolation
that
would
sometimes
engulf
me
as
it
were
with
a
deep
flood
for
many
weeks
at
a
time
i
never
spoke
to
any
human
being
save
to
my
pupils
on
euclid
and
cæsar
and
this
was
a
speech
that
was
no
speech
and
being
born
i
believe
with
at
least
the
usual
instincts
of
human
fellowship
and
a
great
love
of
all
genial
interchanges
of
thought
and
opinion
this
silence
seared
my
spirit
to
the
interior
sense
i
must
have
shown
as
something
burnt
and
blasted
with
and
fires
indeed
when
i
was
released
from
this
life
in
the
manner
that
i
have
described
i
came
out
as
it
were
a
prisoner
from
the
black
pit
of
his
dungeon
all
confused
trembling
and
afraid
scarce
able
to
bear
the
light
of
genial
affection
for
a
long
while
i
spoke
but
little
and
then
with
difficulty
i
was
fast
losing
the
habit
of
speech
indeed
the
eighteen
months
in
clarendon
road
had
been
a
very
grave
experience
but
i
think
that
what
affected
my
relations
most
in
my
demeanour
was
this
for
a
long
time
i
would
cut
myself
a
piece
of
dry
bread
at
tea
and
munch
it
mechanically
having
forgotten
all
about
the
use
of
butter
this
struck
them
as
dreadful
one
might
be
poor
but
to
eat
dry
bread
was
more
than
poverty
it
was
beggary
when
my
aunt
first
noticed
this
trick
of
mine
she
pushed
the
butter
dish
towards
me
saying
in
a
disturbed
voice
that
there
was
no
need
for
any
more
and
for
many
days
i
was
in
a
sort
of
swoon
of
delight
i
had
no
desire
for
activities
of
any
kind
i
had
all
the
happy
languor
of
the
convalescent
about
me
it
was
bliss
to
stroll
gently
in
that
delicious
air
to
watch
the
mists
vanishing
from
the
in
the
morning
to
see
again
the
old
white
farms
beneath
twyn
barlwm
and
mynydd
maen
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
to
lie
in
deep
green
shade
and
to
feel
that
i
was
at
home
again
that
my
troubles
were
over
i
did
not
fret
myself
by
inquiring
as
to
whether
they
would
not
begin
again
indeed
in
this
first
passion
of
relief
i
loved
to
imagine
myself
as
dwelling
for
the
rest
of
my
days
amidst
friendly
faces
in
a
friendly
land
and
devoting
say
fifty
years
to
healing
the
wounds
of
eighteen
months
it
is
a
sorry
thing
to
be
but
and
to
feel
so
but
it
is
thus
i
suppose
that
the
man
of
the
imaginative
cast
of
mind
pays
and
pays
heavily
for
whatever
qualities
he
may
possess
and
it
will
always
be
a
question
whether
the
price
exacted
be
not
too
dear
and
beyond
all
proportion
to
the
value
received
but
the
case
i
apprehend
is
this
masefield
has
said
very
finely
that
literature
is
the
art
of
presenting
the
world
as
it
were
to
the
lovers
in
stephen
phillips
drama
of
paolo
and
francesca
the
earth
appears
a
greener
green
the
heavens
a
bluer
blue
all
beautiful
things
are
raised
to
a
higher
power
by
the
fire
of
their
passion
the
whole
world
is
alchemised
and
this
state
which
is
a
result
of
love
is
the
condition
of
imaginative
work
in
literature
and
so
the
man
who
is
to
make
romances
sees
everything
and
feels
everything
acutely
or
as
masefield
says
excessively
now
there
would
be
nothing
amiss
in
this
state
of
things
if
these
exalted
and
intensified
perceptions
could
be
utilised
when
there
was
a
question
of
making
a
book
and
then
abrogated
and
laid
aside
with
pen
and
ink
and
paper
unluckily
however
this
can
not
be
so
managed
and
too
often
the
dealer
in
dreams
finds
that
his
magic
magnifying
glass
is
tight
fixed
to
his
eyes
and
can
not
be
moved
and
thus
a
mere
common
bore
or
nuisance
appears
to
him
as
dreadful
as
nero
or
heliogabalus
the
possibility
of
missing
a
train
is
as
tragical
as
hamlet
and
the
pettiest
griefs
swell
into
the
hugest
sorrows
i
in
truth
had
suffered
i
had
been
through
a
dreary
and
a
dismal
experience
enough
but
my
pains
had
racked
me
to
excess
the
pinpricks
unpleasant
in
plain
earnest
had
become
stabs
of
a
poisoned
dagger
and
so
i
came
back
to
gwent
as
to
avalon
there
to
heal
me
of
my
grievous
wounds
so
as
i
say
it
was
mercifully
given
to
me
to
saunter
under
the
apple
trees
in
july
and
august
weather
to
watch
the
sun
and
the
wind
on
the
quivering
woods
to
wander
alone
and
yet
how
deeply
consoled
and
medicined
by
the
winding
soar
valley
now
and
again
i
recollected
as
i
hope
we
shall
recollect
earthly
torments
in
paradise
as
things
over
and
paid
for
the
interminable
cruel
labyrinths
of
london
i
saw
myself
again
a
unhappy
desolate
wretch
astray
in
those
intolerable
friendless
stony
mazes
of
notting
hill
and
paddington
and
harrow
road
i
came
again
by
obscene
obscure
paths
to
kensal
green
the
place
of
the
whited
sepulchres
or
the
hideous
raw
row
of
suburban
houses
would
suddenly
confront
me
surging
up
a
foul
growth
from
the
green
meadow
or
the
sick
reek
of
the
brickfields
by
acton
vale
blew
in
my
nostrils
and
the
grim
little
room
and
solitude
for
the
end
of
every
journey
i
recollected
these
things
but
though
only
days
or
weeks
had
been
interposed
between
my
happy
state
and
my
endurance
of
them
they
were
as
torments
suffered
in
some
remote
æon
i
said
to
myself
i
am
as
they
that
rest
at
last
and
almost
heard
the
words
with
whatso
in
that
psalm
is
after
written
among
the
books
that
i
kept
in
my
library
in
clarendon
road
i
mentioned
that
queer
piece
of
sham
learning
and
entertaining
extravagance
the
rosicrucians
their
rites
and
mysteries
by
hargrave
or
hargreave
jennings
i
said
that
this
odd
volume
had
eventually
a
curious
influence
on
my
life
and
this
was
as
follows
i
was
reading
herodotus
and
that
portion
of
herodotus
which
treats
of
egypt
i
have
long
ago
forgotten
the
muse
which
names
the
book
and
herodotus
it
will
be
remembered
was
very
deeply
interested
in
the
mysteries
of
the
egyptian
religion
in
treating
of
these
occult
things
of
osiris
the
historian
mentions
certain
singular
matters
which
were
highly
pertinent
to
jennings
thesis
if
jennings
could
be
said
to
have
had
anything
so
definite
as
a
thesis
but
the
rosicrucians
contained
no
mention
of
that
which
herodotus
had
seen
when
night
was
on
the
nile
so
i
ventured
to
write
to
the
ingenious
author
pointing
out
the
particular
passage
which
i
thought
would
interest
him
jennings
did
not
answer
my
letter
he
was
odd
to
extremity
in
most
things
but
in
this
particular
he
conformed
perfectly
to
all
the
literary
men
whom
i
encountered
in
my
early
days
i
came
into
contact
with
four
or
five
men
of
a
certain
reputation
or
perhaps
i
should
say
i
came
within
sight
of
them
and
they
could
very
easily
have
flung
me
a
word
or
two
of
encouragement
which
would
have
been
very
precious
to
me
then
but
i
never
had
that
word
and
so
was
forced
to
go
on
and
do
my
best
without
it
the
better
way
no
doubt
but
a
hard
way
but
though
the
author
of
the
rosicrucians
did
not
reply
to
my
letter
he
passed
my
name
and
address
to
another
man
a
young
fellow
who
had
just
set
up
as
a
publisher
and
was
going
to
issue
one
of
the
astounding
jennings
books
so
davenport
the
publisher
sent
me
his
catalogue
of
new
and
books
and
i
on
reading
it
sent
him
the
manuscript
of
my
anatomy
of
tankards
here
a
parenthesis
if
not
several
parentheses
we
are
now
in
and
i
had
finished
the
anatomy
in
the
autumn
of
soon
after
it
was
ended
i
sent
the
to
a
gentleman
who
was
then
but
in
a
small
way
he
is
now
a
very
eminent
publisher
indeed
and
loved
so
much
by
his
authors
by
some
of
them
at
all
events
as
to
be
known
as
uncle
well
uncle
though
alas
it
was
not
fated
that
he
should
ever
be
of
mine
sent
back
the
in
due
season
with
a
letter
that
almost
made
up
for
any
disappointment
my
first
boomerang
may
have
occasioned
his
letter
delighted
me
not
because
it
was
specially
complimentary
nor
because
it
gave
evidence
of
a
careful
and
critical
reading
of
the
rejected
manuscript
but
because
it
was
almost
a
replica
of
the
publisher
letter
which
introduces
tobias
smollett
admirable
epistolary
romance
humphry
clinker
my
actual
publisher
so
resembled
smollett
feigned
bookseller
in
the
manner
of
his
letter
that
i
should
suppose
the
one
had
deliberately
made
the
other
his
model
did
i
not
know
uncle
to
be
far
too
good
a
man
to
read
such
a
book
as
humphry
clinker
i
have
not
got
my
smollett
by
me
i
am
sorry
to
say
so
i
can
not
quote
but
i
may
mention
that
both
publishers
made
a
very
liberal
use
of
the
dash
or
mark
of
parenthesis
and
were
curious
in
avoiding
the
word
i
my
letter
ran
somewhat
as
follows
dear
sir
referring
to
your
favour
of
the
enclosing
of
work
of
tankards
have
read
with
interest
fear
it
would
hardly
command
large
sale
have
had
little
encouragement
to
speculate
lately
would
recommend
topic
of
more
general
public
interest
hoping
to
have
pleasure
of
hearing
from
you
on
some
future
occasion
etc
etc
i
was
delighted
only
a
few
years
ago
to
find
that
uncle
hand
has
not
lost
its
epistolary
cunning
a
distinguished
friend
of
mine
had
been
good
enough
of
his
own
motion
not
with
my
knowledge
to
write
to
this
publisher
suggesting
that
a
book
by
me
would
ornament
his
catalogue
the
publisher
approached
me
by
letter
i
wrote
to
him
briefly
saying
that
i
was
just
finishing
a
romance
he
wrote
back
sorry
you
speak
of
a
romance
fear
there
is
very
little
sale
for
those
old
things
however
etc
etc
i
did
not
trouble
to
go
into
whatever
might
lie
beyond
the
portals
of
however
but
note
the
phrase
those
old
things
it
seems
to
me
more
precious
than
gold
that
has
passed
the
furnace
but
to
return
from
this
backwater
of
narrative
i
found
davenport
established
in
an
old
street
in
the
quarter
of
covent
garden
i
got
to
know
this
street
well
afterwards
and
to
like
it
too
for
all
its
associations
and
circumstances
over
the
way
opposite
to
offices
was
the
house
where
they
said
de
quincey
had
written
his
great
book
there
were
theatrical
shops
all
tinsel
and
wigs
and
grease
paints
close
at
hand
and
on
market
days
the
street
was
all
apack
with
carts
and
waggons
and
clamorous
with
marketmen
who
are
still
a
rough
and
primitive
and
jovial
race
indeed
the
market
overflowed
into
york
street
and
submerged
it
and
i
have
had
to
leap
over
an
undergrowth
of
green
springing
ferns
established
on
the
office
steps
davenport
had
written
me
a
very
agreeable
letter
and
we
had
a
very
agreeable
interview
the
book
on
his
which
had
attracted
my
attention
was
called
tavern
talk
and
maltworms
gossip
and
an
admirable
little
anthology
it
was
compiled
as
i
found
out
afterwards
by
davenport
himself
i
thought
there
was
a
certain
congruity
between
this
book
and
my
anatomy
of
tankards
hence
the
despatch
of
the
manuscript
to
york
street
the
publisher
liked
my
book
very
much
he
wanted
to
publish
it
badly
but
there
were
certain
preliminaries
to
be
adjusted
before
this
could
be
done
and
i
did
not
see
how
the
obstacle
could
be
surmounted
this
conference
took
place
at
that
singular
hour
of
my
career
when
my
pupils
seemed
to
melt
away
from
me
as
though
they
had
been
morning
dew
i
was
just
bound
for
the
country
and
the
publisher
agreed
to
hold
the
little
matter
of
which
i
have
spoken
in
suspense
so
i
went
westward
and
there
in
gwent
there
were
kind
people
who
had
known
my
father
all
his
days
and
my
grandfather
before
him
and
so
for
the
sake
of
the
family
they
helped
me
to
arrange
those
preliminaries
and
after
all
perhaps
it
is
fair
enough
that
a
man
should
pay
his
footing
when
he
enters
the
craft
so
here
was
another
element
or
elixir
in
the
potion
of
my
bliss
that
i
was
drinking
among
those
hills
and
woods
of
gwent
the
bad
old
days
were
all
over
and
my
torments
were
past
clarendon
road
and
all
its
sad
concatenations
were
like
a
black
wrack
of
cloud
seen
far
down
on
the
horizon
as
the
sun
rises
splendid
on
a
bright
and
happy
day
i
was
come
to
the
territory
of
which
was
avalon
and
every
herb
of
the
fields
and
all
the
leaves
of
the
wood
and
the
waters
of
all
wells
and
streams
were
appointed
for
my
healing
and
my
book
was
going
to
be
published
i
was
to
see
myself
in
print
between
covers
vegetable
vellum
they
turned
out
to
be
and
i
should
be
reviewed
in
london
newspapers
and
not
a
doubt
of
it
be
happy
ever
after
pecksniff
it
will
be
remembered
spoke
of
the
melancholy
sweetness
of
youthful
hopes
i
remember
thinking
once
myself
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
that
pickled
onions
grew
on
trees
and
that
every
elephant
was
born
with
an
impregnable
castle
on
his
back
i
have
not
found
the
fact
to
be
so
far
from
it
nor
have
i
found
the
fact
to
be
so
still
these
visions
of
fair
print
and
and
reviews
are
very
pleasant
in
the
green
of
youth
and
they
helped
to
make
that
summer
of
delightful
for
me
i
worked
in
the
thought
of
the
coming
even
the
anticipation
of
a
is
almost
too
much
joy
at
into
my
escape
from
hard
bondage
into
the
summer
sunlight
into
the
odours
of
the
solemn
woods
at
night
into
the
cool
breath
of
the
brook
into
the
twilight
fires
of
the
sky
above
twyn
barlwm
they
were
brave
days
while
they
lasted
and
now
and
again
i
had
gallant
tramps
over
the
country
with
my
old
friend
bill
rowlands
i
saw
bill
a
couple
of
years
ago
after
an
interval
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
bill
wore
a
long
black
coat
and
a
solemn
collar
having
been
a
clerk
in
holy
orders
for
many
years
but
when
i
began
to
speak
of
the
little
tavern
at
there
was
a
twinkle
in
bill
eye
and
at
the
mention
of
the
chimes
of
usk
we
both
laughed
till
we
cried
and
perhaps
we
did
cry
internally
but
i
said
to
bill
now
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
café
royal
it
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
but
i
wish
it
were
the
three
salmons
at
usk
where
if
i
remember
rightly
we
had
bread
and
cheese
and
a
great
deal
of
beer
and
hot
brandy
and
water
to
follow
but
that
was
a
great
day
we
had
gone
over
hill
and
dale
through
the
depths
of
woods
and
over
waste
lands
finding
footpaths
in
the
most
unsuspected
places
that
we
had
never
dreamed
of
and
i
remember
that
these
footpaths
gave
me
a
singular
impression
of
travelling
in
time
backwards
not
forwards
as
in
wells
enchantment
for
the
track
of
feet
was
but
barely
marked
and
seemed
on
the
point
to
fade
away
altogether
and
the
stiles
that
we
climbed
were
of
old
old
oak
whitened
and
riven
with
age
and
the
outlets
of
these
paths
were
into
deep
forgotten
lanes
where
no
one
came
and
if
one
passed
a
house
it
was
roofless
and
ruinous
its
standing
grey
with
corbel
stones
the
garden
wall
was
fallen
into
a
heap
of
stones
and
the
fruit
trees
were
dead
or
straggled
into
wildness
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
had
fallen
on
old
ways
that
were
not
of
our
day
at
all
and
no
one
perhaps
had
been
there
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
years
and
if
we
saw
anyone
it
would
not
be
a
man
of
our
time
bill
i
am
convinced
thought
nothing
of
all
this
his
talk
was
of
and
mad
tricks
and
all
the
mirth
in
the
world
and
i
warmed
the
chilled
hands
of
my
spirit
at
his
gaiety
as
i
had
longed
to
warm
my
bodily
hands
at
the
watchman
brazier
glowing
red
in
the
cold
london
street
so
bill
and
i
came
at
last
into
caerleon
having
succeeded
by
much
extraordinary
wandering
in
making
five
miles
into
ten
and
at
caerleon
we
drank
old
ale
at
the
hanbury
arms
which
is
a
mediæval
hostelry
close
to
the
roman
tower
by
the
river
and
then
nothing
would
satisfy
us
but
to
go
to
usk
by
the
old
road
again
ten
miles
instead
of
five
but
with
our
short
cut
imposed
upon
it
a
good
fifteen
miles
the
way
goes
over
the
river
on
the
right
are
king
arthur
round
table
and
the
relics
of
the
roman
city
wall
of
isca
silurum
as
the
second
augustan
legion
garrisoned
at
caerleon
called
the
place
then
through
the
village
still
known
in
my
days
as
and
so
into
that
most
wonderful
enchanted
delicious
road
that
winds
under
the
hillside
under
deep
wentwood
above
the
solemn
curves
and
esses
of
the
river
we
passed
bulmore
which
does
not
mean
a
moor
of
bulls
but
pwll
mawr
the
great
pool
of
the
usk
river
it
is
a
farmhouse
now
but
once
a
retired
officer
of
the
augustan
had
his
villa
here
and
his
graveyard
also
and
here
i
think
in
the
orchard
as
they
were
planting
some
young
trees
they
found
the
stone
inscribed
julia
carissima
conjux
in
æternum
hail
julia
dearest
wife
farewell
for
ever
and
here
to
the
best
of
my
belief
bill
was
telling
me
how
an
undergraduate
friend
of
his
at
a
schoolfellow
of
mine
found
himself
under
the
painful
necessity
of
screwing
up
the
dean
in
his
rooms
the
screws
employed
being
headless
that
is
and
not
to
be
extracted
without
enormous
pains
we
went
on
our
way
by
the
river
and
passed
under
kemeys
a
noble
grey
old
house
with
mullioned
windows
and
elizabethan
chimneys
there
is
such
a
peace
about
this
place
such
a
sweetness
from
the
wood
such
a
refreshment
from
the
water
so
grave
a
repose
upon
it
that
i
translated
to
kemeys
one
of
my
heroes
a
clerk
in
shepherd
bush
this
clerk
had
found
out
that
all
the
bustle
and
activity
of
modern
life
are
delusions
and
wild
errors
and
his
reward
was
to
be
that
he
should
end
his
days
at
kemeys
sheltered
from
all
turmoil
and
vanity
garnered
from
the
evil
world
the
peace
of
kemeys
was
the
peace
of
all
the
valley
of
the
usk
and
what
balms
it
exhibited
to
my
spirit
only
those
can
know
who
have
been
bred
in
such
places
and
have
experienced
the
jar
and
dust
and
racket
of
some
great
town
and
then
have
returned
to
the
old
groves
my
friend
bill
and
i
went
swinging
along
the
winding
lane
beside
the
winding
river
and
as
we
went
the
sound
of
pouring
waters
sang
to
us
for
now
the
of
the
wells
of
wentwood
came
from
the
hill
as
rivulets
and
about
each
stream
its
twisted
thicket
grew
accompanying
it
all
down
the
steep
to
the
river
below
we
passed
little
kemeys
church
watching
above
the
pools
of
the
usk
and
then
on
the
hillside
almost
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
was
bartholly
that
solitary
house
which
awed
me
for
years
so
that
i
made
my
awe
into
a
tale
and
here
was
newbridge
crossing
a
river
that
had
now
ceased
to
be
tidal
and
yellow
and
had
become
glassy
clear
and
so
on
northward
and
it
seemed
into
silences
and
solitudes
that
grew
ever
deeper
and
more
solemn
more
evidently
declaring
the
great
of
god
that
has
made
all
the
world
the
day
drew
on
the
sun
sank
below
wild
unknown
hills
neither
of
us
had
ever
been
this
way
before
and
the
green
world
was
dim
for
a
while
and
then
was
lighted
up
with
the
red
flames
of
the
afterglow
the
evening
redness
appeared
and
in
those
fires
the
ash
tree
became
of
immortal
growth
the
round
hills
rose
above
no
earthly
land
the
winding
river
was
a
faery
stream
then
veil
upon
veil
rising
from
the
level
rising
from
the
fountains
in
the
wood
mists
closing
in
upon
us
my
friend
bill
said
we
should
never
get
to
usk
at
this
rate
he
felt
sure
that
there
must
be
a
short
cut
across
the
fields
so
we
took
the
first
stile
that
appeared
and
set
out
over
country
that
was
utterly
unknown
to
us
and
the
marvel
was
that
we
ever
got
to
usk
at
all
or
to
anywhere
for
the
matter
of
that
i
have
a
confused
recollection
of
walking
for
hours
in
a
gathering
darkness
through
jungles
and
brakes
of
dark
wood
climbing
hills
that
rose
fantastic
as
out
of
dreamland
going
down
into
dusky
valleys
where
white
mist
rose
icy
from
the
courses
of
the
brooks
threading
an
uncertain
way
through
quaking
marshland
and
the
regions
of
the
distance
as
vague
as
shapes
of
smoke
the
bells
were
ringing
nine
when
we
came
out
of
this
dim
world
into
usk
and
to
the
lights
and
cheerfulness
of
the
three
salmons
to
ale
and
to
laughter
there
was
a
wonderful
old
fellow
a
water
bailiff
making
the
mirth
of
that
cheerful
ancient
parlour
and
he
told
us
of
the
tricks
he
had
played
on
poachers
and
fishermen
till
we
roared
again
he
was
a
fellow
of
strange
disguises
if
one
of
his
stories
were
to
be
believed
he
had
caught
the
most
famous
salmon
poacher
of
the
usk
by
assuming
the
gait
and
utterance
of
a
calf
seeking
for
its
mother
at
midnight
the
tale
may
have
been
true
it
was
certainly
an
excellent
entertainment
such
was
one
of
our
days
and
again
we
would
go
wandering
over
the
mountains
to
west
and
to
northward
climbing
up
into
great
high
wild
places
of
yellow
gorse
and
grey
limestone
rocks
stretching
and
mounting
onward
and
still
beyond
so
that
one
said
in
one
heart
for
ever
and
ever
amen
high
up
there
the
sunlight
on
that
golden
gorse
on
the
yellow
lichens
that
encrusted
the
rocks
ringed
in
old
druid
circles
the
great
sweet
wind
that
blew
there
the
heart
of
youth
that
rejoiced
there
all
the
dear
shining
land
of
gwent
far
below
us
glorious
it
is
all
an
old
song
and
there
was
a
day
on
which
we
mounted
over
mynydd
maen
and
came
down
into
a
valley
in
the
very
heart
of
the
mountains
and
walked
there
all
the
day
and
in
the
evening
returned
again
over
the
mountain
at
the
southern
end
winding
under
twyn
barlwm
as
the
twilight
fell
it
is
only
music
i
think
that
could
image
the
wonder
of
the
red
sky
over
the
faery
dome
and
the
gathering
dusk
of
the
night
as
it
fell
on
the
rocks
of
that
high
land
on
the
streams
rushing
vehemently
down
into
the
darkness
of
the
valley
on
the
lower
woods
on
the
white
farms
gleaming
and
then
vanishing
away
only
by
music
if
at
all
can
such
things
be
expressed
since
they
are
ineffable
not
to
be
uttered
in
any
literal
or
logical
speech
of
men
and
if
one
looks
a
little
more
closely
into
the
nature
of
things
it
will
become
pretty
plain
i
think
that
all
that
really
matters
and
really
exists
is
ineffable
that
both
the
world
without
us
the
tree
and
the
brook
and
the
hill
and
the
world
within
us
do
perpetually
and
necessarily
transcend
all
our
powers
of
utterance
whether
to
ourselves
or
to
others
night
and
day
sunrise
and
moonrise
and
the
noble
assemblage
of
the
stars
are
continually
exhibited
to
us
and
we
are
forced
to
confess
that
not
for
one
moment
can
we
proclaim
these
appearances
adequately
we
stammer
confusedly
about
them
much
as
a
savage
who
had
been
taken
through
the
national
gallery
might
stammer
a
few
broken
sentences
the
applicability
of
which
would
be
more
or
less
dubious
woman
very
bright
round
head
might
be
the
description
of
a
famous
madonna
and
a
turner
would
be
summed
up
as
plenty
clouds
one
big
tree
and
in
like
manner
we
confronted
not
only
with
things
remote
and
majestic
but
with
things
familiar
and
near
at
hand
stutter
a
few
lame
sentences
endeavouring
to
describe
what
we
have
seen
and
thus
all
literature
can
be
but
an
approximation
to
the
truth
not
the
truth
of
science
for
that
is
a
figment
of
the
brain
a
monster
like
dragons
griffins
and
basilisks
but
to
that
truth
which
keats
perceived
to
be
identical
with
beauty
and
it
is
further
evident
that
even
this
approximation
to
the
truth
of
things
is
a
matter
of
the
utmost
difficulty
and
not
very
far
from
a
miracle
inasmuch
as
in
a
generation
of
men
there
are
only
two
or
three
who
achieve
it
who
in
consequence
are
hailed
as
men
of
the
highest
genius
of
course
there
are
persons
for
whom
truth
implies
even
securities
slumped
heavily
or
some
such
statement
to
them
i
tender
my
sincere
apologies
the
of
my
book
began
to
appear
early
in
that
autumn
of
they
made
me
rapturous
reading
and
while
i
was
correcting
them
with
a
vast
sense
of
the
importance
and
dignity
of
the
task
davenport
the
publisher
was
writing
to
me
asking
if
i
had
any
ideas
for
new
books
and
throwing
out
suggestions
of
his
own
now
this
was
very
pleasant
for
it
all
tended
to
persuade
me
in
spite
of
any
doubts
and
fears
of
mine
that
i
was
really
a
literary
man
i
would
read
davenport
letters
again
and
again
and
deliberate
gravely
with
myself
over
the
answering
of
them
i
enjoyed
this
very
much
indeed
but
the
correspondence
led
to
no
practical
result
because
i
could
not
then
or
ever
perform
the
indian
mango
trick
the
expert
conjurers
of
the
east
as
is
well
known
in
magazine
fiction
will
put
a
seed
into
a
flower
pot
cover
up
for
a
second
or
two
and
lo
there
is
a
little
plant
again
the
concealment
the
plant
has
grown
and
so
forth
till
within
the
space
of
five
minutes
you
can
gather
ripe
mangoes
from
the
tree
that
you
saw
sown
this
is
the
mango
trick
of
fiction
that
of
fact
as
i
have
seen
it
is
about
the
dreariest
and
most
ineffective
piece
of
conjuring
imaginable
but
as
i
say
i
could
never
imitate
those
fabled
orientals
if
murray
and
longman
were
to
jostle
one
another
on
my
doorstep
clamouring
for
a
masterpiece
and
offering
arabian
terms
it
would
make
no
difference
if
i
had
no
book
within
me
i
should
not
be
able
to
produce
one
on
demand
in
practice
i
have
found
that
i
take
about
ten
years
to
grow
these
things
though
i
have
one
in
my
mind
now
that
was
first
thought
of
in
and
is
not
yet
begun
so
davenport
letters
produced
no
literature
interesting
though
they
were
and
i
must
say
that
a
less
sluggish
mind
would
have
found
them
stimulating
in
a
high
degree
but
the
literary
publisher
struck
on
cold
iron
he
suggested
i
remember
a
volume
of
scathing
criticism
like
mozley
essays
as
likely
to
receive
his
most
favourable
attention
but
really
i
could
not
think
of
anybody
that
i
particularly
wanted
to
scathe
now
perhaps
i
could
oblige
a
publisher
in
search
of
anathemas
and
ernulphus
curses
and
i
had
not
read
mozley
nor
have
i
read
him
to
this
day
then
i
on
my
side
suggested
a
book
to
be
called
a
quiet
life
this
being
in
fact
a
description
of
the
life
that
i
was
then
gratefully
and
gladly
leading
i
sent
a
specimen
chapter
and
so
far
as
i
remember
davenport
counselled
me
to
defer
the
writing
of
sort
of
book
till
i
was
eighty
or
thereabouts
i
daresay
he
was
right
then
my
copies
of
the
anatomy
of
tankards
reached
me
and
i
believe
that
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
book
printed
and
complete
in
its
vegetable
vellum
boards
i
began
to
be
ashamed
of
it
i
think
that
this
was
hard
lines
but
the
trick
has
been
played
on
me
again
and
again
and
i
do
believe
that
a
moderate
not
excessive
dose
of
the
good
conceit
of
oneself
is
one
of
the
chiefest
boons
that
parents
should
beg
from
fairy
godmothers
for
their
offspring
for
life
is
necessarily
full
of
such
buffetings
and
duckings
such
kicks
and
blows
and
pummellings
that
balms
and
elixirs
and
medicaments
of
healing
are
most
urgently
indicated
and
there
is
nothing
equal
to
this
same
rectified
spirit
of
conceit
it
may
tend
to
make
a
man
an
ass
but
it
is
better
or
more
agreeable
anyhow
to
be
an
ass
than
to
be
miserable
then
came
the
reviews
and
they
did
me
some
good
for
as
far
as
i
remember
them
they
were
kindly
and
indulgent
i
think
the
critic
of
the
james
gazette
then
in
its
glory
under
the
editorship
of
greenwood
spoke
of
this
witty
and
humorous
book
while
he
said
with
absolute
justice
that
i
had
ruined
the
popularity
of
my
parodies
by
their
prolixity
then
the
publisher
despairing
i
suppose
of
getting
any
ideas
out
of
me
produced
a
notion
of
his
own
he
sent
me
three
or
four
french
texts
of
the
heptameron
and
bade
me
render
it
into
the
best
english
that
i
had
within
me
and
so
i
did
forthwith
for
the
sum
of
twenty
pounds
sterling
i
wrote
every
night
when
the
house
was
still
and
every
day
i
carried
the
roll
of
copy
down
the
lane
to
meet
the
postman
on
his
way
to
and
so
my
story
has
come
round
full
circle
in
the
first
of
these
chapters
i
told
how
the
kindly
speaker
at
the
persian
club
praising
my
version
of
the
french
classic
transported
me
in
an
instant
from
that
shining
banqueting
hall
in
the
heart
of
london
over
the
bridge
of
thirty
years
into
the
shadows
of
the
deep
lane
again
it
was
the
autumn
evening
and
the
november
twilight
was
passing
into
the
gloom
of
night
there
was
a
white
ghost
of
the
day
in
the
sky
far
down
in
the
west
but
the
bare
woods
were
darkening
under
the
leaden
clouds
the
familiar
country
grew
into
a
wild
land
and
i
with
time
to
spare
walk
slowly
meditatively
down
the
hill
holding
my
manuscript
hoping
that
the
day
portion
has
been
well
done
as
i
come
to
the
stile
there
sounds
faint
through
the
rising
of
the
melancholy
night
wind
the
note
of
the
postman
horn
he
has
climbed
the
steep
road
that
leads
from
llandegveth
village
and
is
now
two
or
three
fields
away
it
grows
very
dark
the
waiting
figure
by
the
stile
vanishes
into
the
gloom
i
can
see
it
no
more
the
end
far
off
things
was
written
in
and
the
work
not
being
of
an
encyclopædic
nature
no
effort
has
been
made
to
bring
it
up
to
date
the
book
called
the
anatomy
of
tankards
in
the
text
was
called
in
fact
the
anatomy
of
tobacco
