wilson
new
calendar
from
diary
called
i
had
not
seen
him
since
nauheim
germany
several
years
ago
the
time
that
the
cholera
broke
out
at
hamburg
we
talked
of
the
people
we
had
known
there
or
had
casually
met
and
said
do
you
remember
my
introducing
you
to
an
earl
the
earl
of
yes
that
was
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
and
he
were
in
a
carriage
just
starting
belated
for
the
train
i
remember
it
i
remember
it
too
because
of
a
thing
which
happened
then
which
i
was
not
looking
for
he
had
told
me
a
while
before
about
a
remarkable
and
interesting
californian
whom
he
had
met
and
who
was
a
friend
of
yours
and
said
that
if
he
should
ever
meet
you
he
would
ask
you
for
some
particulars
about
that
californian
the
subject
was
not
mentioned
that
day
at
nauheim
for
we
were
hurrying
away
and
there
was
no
time
but
the
thing
that
surprised
me
was
this
when
i
induced
you
you
said
am
glad
to
meet
your
lordship
gain
the
i
again
was
the
surprise
he
is
a
little
hard
of
hearing
and
did
catch
that
word
and
i
thought
you
had
intended
that
he
should
as
we
drove
off
i
had
only
time
to
say
what
do
you
know
about
him
and
i
understood
you
to
say
nothing
except
that
he
is
the
quickest
judge
of
then
we
were
gone
and
i
did
get
the
rest
i
wondered
what
it
was
that
he
was
such
a
quick
judge
of
i
have
thought
of
it
many
times
since
and
still
wondered
what
it
could
be
he
and
i
talked
it
over
but
could
not
guess
it
out
he
thought
it
must
be
or
horses
for
he
is
a
good
judge
of
those
no
one
is
a
better
but
you
could
know
that
because
you
did
know
him
you
had
mistaken
him
for
some
one
else
it
must
be
that
he
said
because
he
knew
you
had
never
met
him
before
and
of
course
you
had
had
you
yes
i
had
is
that
so
where
at
a
in
england
how
curious
that
is
why
he
had
the
least
recollection
of
it
had
you
any
conversation
with
him
some
yes
well
it
left
not
the
least
impression
upon
him
what
did
you
talk
about
about
the
fox
i
think
that
was
all
why
that
would
interest
him
that
ought
to
have
left
an
impression
what
did
he
talk
about
the
fox
it
very
curious
i
do
understand
it
did
what
he
said
leave
an
impression
upon
you
yes
it
showed
me
that
he
was
a
quick
judge
of
however
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
then
you
will
understand
it
was
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
or
i
had
an
american
friend
in
london
named
who
was
fond
of
hunting
and
his
friends
the
blanks
invited
him
and
me
to
come
out
to
a
hunt
and
be
their
guests
at
their
country
place
in
the
morning
the
mounts
were
provided
but
when
i
saw
the
horses
i
changed
my
mind
and
asked
permission
to
walk
i
had
never
seen
an
english
hunter
before
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
hunt
a
fox
safer
on
the
ground
i
had
always
been
diffident
about
horses
anyway
even
those
of
the
common
altitudes
and
i
did
not
feel
competent
to
hunt
on
a
horse
that
went
on
stilts
so
then
blank
came
to
my
help
and
said
i
could
go
with
her
in
the
and
we
would
drive
to
a
place
she
knew
of
and
there
we
should
have
a
good
glimpse
of
the
hunt
as
it
went
by
when
we
got
to
that
place
i
got
out
and
went
and
leaned
my
elbows
on
a
low
stone
wall
which
enclosed
a
turfy
and
beautiful
great
field
with
heavy
wood
on
all
its
sides
except
ours
blank
sat
in
the
fifty
yards
away
which
was
as
near
as
she
could
get
with
the
vehicle
i
was
full
of
interest
for
i
had
never
seen
a
i
waited
dreaming
and
imagining
in
the
deep
stillness
and
impressive
tranquility
which
reigned
in
that
retired
spot
presently
from
away
off
in
the
forest
on
the
left
a
mellow
came
floating
then
all
of
a
sudden
a
multitude
of
dogs
burst
out
of
that
forest
and
went
tearing
by
and
disappeared
in
the
forest
on
the
right
there
was
a
pause
and
then
a
cloud
of
horsemen
in
black
caps
and
crimson
coats
plunged
out
of
the
forest
and
went
flaming
across
the
field
like
a
a
stirring
sight
to
see
there
was
one
man
ahead
of
the
rest
and
he
came
spurring
straight
at
me
he
was
fiercely
excited
it
was
fine
to
see
him
ride
he
was
a
master
horseman
he
came
like
a
storm
till
he
was
within
seven
feet
of
me
where
i
was
leaning
on
the
wall
then
he
stood
his
horse
straight
up
in
the
air
on
his
hind
and
shouted
like
a
demon
way
the
fox
go
i
did
much
like
the
tone
but
i
did
not
let
on
for
he
was
excited
you
know
but
i
was
calm
so
i
said
softly
and
without
acrimony
fox
it
seemed
to
anger
him
i
do
know
why
and
he
thundered
out
fox
why
the
fox
which
way
did
the
fox
go
i
said
with
great
gentleness
even
argumentatively
you
could
be
a
little
more
definite
a
little
less
vague
because
i
am
a
stranger
and
there
are
many
foxes
as
you
will
know
even
better
than
i
and
unless
i
know
which
one
it
is
that
you
desire
to
identify
and
certainly
the
damdest
idiot
that
has
escaped
in
a
thousand
years
and
he
snatched
his
great
horse
around
as
easily
as
i
would
snatch
a
cat
and
was
away
like
a
hurricane
a
very
excitable
man
i
went
back
to
blank
and
she
was
excited
too
oh
all
alive
she
said
spoke
to
you
did
he
it
is
what
happened
knew
it
i
could
hear
what
he
said
but
i
knew
be
spoke
to
you
do
you
know
who
it
was
it
was
lord
and
he
is
master
of
the
buckhounds
tell
me
what
do
you
think
of
him
well
for
a
stranger
he
got
the
most
sudden
and
accurate
judgment
of
any
man
i
ever
saw
it
pleased
her
i
thought
it
would
got
away
from
nauheim
just
in
time
to
escape
being
shut
in
by
the
on
the
frontiers
and
so
did
we
for
we
left
the
next
day
but
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
getting
by
the
italian
and
we
should
have
fared
likewise
but
for
the
thoughtfulness
of
our
in
frankfort
he
introduced
me
to
the
italian
and
i
brought
away
from
that
consulate
a
letter
which
made
our
way
smooth
it
was
a
dozen
lines
merely
commending
me
in
a
general
way
to
the
courtesies
of
servants
in
his
italian
majesty
service
but
it
was
more
powerful
than
it
looked
in
addition
to
a
raft
of
ordinary
baggage
we
had
six
or
eight
trunks
which
were
filled
exclusively
with
dutiable
stuff
household
goods
purchased
in
frankfort
for
use
in
florence
where
we
had
taken
a
house
i
was
going
to
ship
these
through
by
express
but
at
the
last
moment
an
order
went
throughout
germany
forbidding
the
moving
of
any
parcels
by
train
unless
the
owner
went
with
them
this
was
a
bad
outlook
we
must
take
these
things
along
and
the
delay
sure
to
be
caused
by
the
examination
of
them
in
the
might
lose
us
our
train
i
imagined
all
sorts
of
terrors
and
enlarged
them
steadily
as
we
approached
the
italian
frontier
we
were
six
in
number
clogged
with
all
that
baggage
and
i
was
courier
for
the
party
the
most
incapable
one
they
ever
employed
we
arrived
and
pressed
with
the
crowd
into
the
immense
and
the
usual
worries
began
everybody
crowding
to
the
counter
and
begging
to
have
his
baggage
examined
first
and
all
hands
clattering
and
chattering
at
once
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
do
nothing
it
would
be
better
to
give
it
all
up
and
go
away
and
leave
the
baggage
i
could
speak
the
language
i
should
never
accomplish
anything
just
then
a
tall
handsome
man
in
a
fine
uniform
was
passing
by
and
i
knew
he
must
be
the
and
that
reminded
me
of
my
letter
i
ran
to
him
and
put
it
into
his
hands
he
took
it
out
of
the
envelope
and
the
moment
his
eye
caught
the
royal
coat
of
arms
printed
at
its
top
he
took
off
his
cap
and
made
a
beautiful
bow
to
me
and
said
in
english
which
is
your
baggage
please
show
it
to
me
i
showed
him
the
mountain
nobody
was
disturbing
it
nobody
was
interested
in
it
all
the
family
attempts
to
get
attention
to
it
had
failed
except
in
the
case
of
one
of
the
trunks
containing
the
dutiable
goods
it
was
just
being
opened
my
officer
said
there
let
that
alone
lock
it
now
chalk
it
chalk
all
of
the
lot
now
please
come
and
show
the
he
plowed
through
the
waiting
crowd
i
following
to
the
counter
and
he
gave
orders
again
in
his
emphatic
military
way
chalk
these
chalk
all
of
them
then
he
took
off
his
cap
and
made
that
beautiful
bow
again
and
went
his
way
by
this
time
these
attentions
had
attracted
the
wonder
of
that
acre
of
passengers
and
the
whisper
had
gone
around
that
the
royal
family
were
present
getting
their
baggage
chalked
and
as
we
passed
down
in
review
on
our
way
to
the
door
i
was
conscious
of
a
pervading
atmosphere
of
envy
which
gave
me
deep
satisfaction
but
soon
there
was
an
accident
my
overcoat
pockets
were
stuffed
with
german
cigars
and
linen
packages
of
american
smoking
tobacco
and
a
porter
was
following
us
around
with
this
overcoat
on
his
arm
and
gradually
getting
it
upside
down
just
as
i
in
the
rear
of
my
family
moved
by
the
sentinels
at
the
door
about
three
hatfuls
of
the
tobacco
tumbled
out
on
the
floor
one
of
the
soldiers
pounced
upon
it
gathered
it
up
in
his
arms
pointed
back
whence
i
had
come
and
marched
me
ahead
of
him
past
that
long
wall
of
passengers
again
he
chattering
and
exulting
like
a
devil
they
smiling
in
peaceful
joy
and
i
trying
to
look
as
if
my
pride
was
not
hurt
and
as
if
i
did
not
mind
being
brought
to
shame
before
these
pleased
people
who
had
so
lately
envied
me
but
at
heart
i
was
cruelly
humbled
when
i
had
been
marched
of
the
long
distance
and
the
misery
of
it
was
at
the
worst
the
stately
stepped
out
from
somewhere
and
the
soldier
left
me
and
darted
after
him
and
overtook
him
and
i
could
see
by
the
soldier
excited
gestures
that
he
was
betraying
to
him
the
whole
shabby
business
the
was
plainly
very
angry
he
came
striding
down
toward
me
and
when
he
was
come
near
he
began
to
pour
out
a
stream
of
indignant
italian
then
suddenly
took
off
his
hat
and
made
that
beautiful
bow
and
said
oh
it
is
you
i
beg
a
thousands
pardons
this
idiot
here
he
turned
to
the
exulting
soldier
and
burst
out
with
a
flood
of
italian
lava
and
the
next
moment
he
was
bowing
and
the
soldier
and
i
were
moving
in
procession
again
he
in
the
lead
and
ashamed
this
time
i
with
my
chin
up
and
so
we
marched
by
the
crowd
of
fascinated
passengers
and
i
went
forth
to
the
train
with
the
honors
of
war
tobacco

never

who
had
seen
it

i
met

few
who
mentioned
having
seen
it
thrown
roughly
described
it
is
a
fat
wooden
cigar
with
its
fastened
to
a
flexible
twig
the
whole
thing
is
only
a
couple
of
feet
long
and
weighs
less
than
two
ounces
this
feather
so
to
call
it
is
not
thrown
through
the
air
but
is
flung
with
an
underhanded
throw
and
made
to
strike
the
ground
a
little
way
in
front
of
the
thrower
then
it
glances
and
makes
a
long
skip
glances
again
skips
again
and
again
and
again
like
the
flat
stone
which
a
boy
sends
skating
over
the
water
the
water
is
smooth
and
the
stone
has
a
good
chance
so
a

man
may
make

travel
fifty
or
yards
but
the
has
no
such
good
chance
for
it
strikes
sand
grass
and
earth
in
its
course
yet
an
expert
aboriginal
has
sent
it
a
measured
distance
of
two
hundred
and
twenty
yards
it
would
have
gone
even
further
but
it
encountered
rank
ferns
and
underwood
on
its
passage
and
they
damaged
its
speed
two
hundred
and
twenty
yards
and
so
weightless
a
toy
a
mouse
on
the
end
of
a
bit
of
wire
in
effect
and
not
sailing
through
the
accommodating
air
but
encountering
grass
and
sand
and
stuff
at
every
jump
it
looks
wholly
impossible
but
brough
smyth
saw
the
feat
and
did
the
measuring
and
set
down
the
facts
in
his
book
about
aboriginal
life
which
he
wrote
by
command
of
the
victorian
government
what
is
the
secret
of
the
feat
no
one
explains
it
can
not
be
physical
strength
for
that
could
not
drive
such
a
any
distance
it
must
be
art
but
no
one
explains
what
the
art
of
it
is
nor
how
it
gets
around
that
law
of
nature
which
says
you
shall
not
throw
any
thing
yards
either
through
the
air
or
bumping
along
the
ground
rev
woods
says
the
distance
to
which
the
or
can
be
thrown
is
truly
astonishing
i
have
seen
an
australian
stand
at
one
side
of
kennington
oval
and
throw
the
kangaroo
rat
completely
across
it
width
of
kensington
oval
not
stated
it
darts
through
the
air
with
the
sharp
and
menacing
hiss
of
a
its
greatest
height
from
the
ground
being
some
seven
or
eight
feet
when
properly
thrown
it
looks
just
like
a
living
animal
leaping
along
its
movements
have
a
wonderful
resemblance
to
the
long
leaps
of
a
fleeing
in
alarm
with
its
long
tail
trailing
behind
it
the
old
settler
said
that
he
had
seen
distances
made
by
the
in
the
early
days
which
almost
convinced
him
that
it
was
as
extraordinary
an
instrument
as
the
boomerang
there
must
have
been
a
large
distribution
of
acuteness
among
those
naked
skinny
aboriginals
or
they
could
have
been
such
unapproachable
trackers
and
boomerangers
and
it
must
have
been
that
put
upon
them
a
good
deal
of
the
intellectual
reputation
which
they
bear
and
have
borne
this
long
time
in
the
estimate
of
them
they
were
lazy
always
lazy
perhaps
that
was
their
trouble
it
is
a
killing
defect
surely
they
could
have
invented
and
built
a
competent
house
but
they
did
and
they
could
have
invented
and
developed
the
agricultural
arts
but
they
did
they
went
naked
and
houseless
and
lived
on
fish
and
grubs
and
worms
and
wild
fruits
and
were
just
plain
savages
for
all
their
smartness
with
a
country
as
big
as
the
united
states
to
live
and
multiply
in
and
with
no
epidemic
diseases
among
them
till
the
white
man
came
with
those
and
his
other
appliances
of
civilization
it
is
quite
probable
that
there
was
never
a
day
in
his
history
when
he
could
muster
of
his
race
in
all
australia
he
diligently
and
deliberately
kept
population
down
by
infanticide
largely
but
mainly
by
certain
other
methods
he
did
not
need
to
practise
these
artificialities
any
more
after
the
white
man
came
the
white
man
knew
ways
of
keeping
down
population
which
were
worth
several
of
his
the
white
man
knew
ways
of
reducing
a
native
population
percent
in
years
the
native
had
never
seen
anything
as
fine
as
that
before
for
example
there
is
the
case
of
the
country
now
called
victoria
a
country
eighty
times
as
large
as
rhode
island
as
i
have
already
said
by
the
best
official
guess
there
were
aboriginals
in
it
when
the
whites
came
along
in
the
middle
of
the
of
these
lived
in
gippsland
a
patch
of
territory
the
size
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
rhode
islands
they
did
not
diminish
as
fast
as
some
of
the
other
communities
indeed
at
the
end
of
forty
years
there
were
still
of
them
left
the
geelong
tribe
diminished
more
satisfactorily
from
persons
it
faded
to
in
twenty
years
at
the
end
of
another
twenty
the
tribe
numbered
one
person
altogether
the
two
melbourne
tribes
could
muster
almost
when
the
white
man
came
they
could
muster
but
twenty
years
later
in
in
that
year
there
were
still
odds
and
ends
of
tribes
scattered
about
the
colony
of
victoria
but
i
was
told
that
natives
of
full
blood
are
very
scarce
now
it
is
said
that
the
aboriginals
continue
in
some
force
in
the
huge
territory
called
queensland
the
early
whites
were
not
used
to
savages
they
could
not
understand
the
primary
law
of
savage
life
that
if
a
man
do
you
a
wrong
his
whole
tribe
is
responsible
each
individual
of
it
and
you
may
take
your
change
out
of
any
individual
of
it
without
bothering
to
seek
out
the
guilty
one
when
a
white
killed
an
aboriginal
the
tribe
applied
the
ancient
law
and
killed
the
first
white
they
came
across
to
the
whites
this
was
a
monstrous
thing
extermination
seemed
to
be
the
proper
medicine
for
such
creatures
as
this
they
did
not
kill
all
the
blacks
but
they
promptly
killed
enough
of
them
to
make
their
own
persons
safe
from
the
dawn
of
civilization
down
to
this
day
the
white
man
has
always
used
that
very
precaution
campbell
praed
lived
in
queensland
as
a
child
in
the
early
days
and
in
her
sketches
of
australian
life
we
get
informing
pictures
of
the
early
struggles
of
the
white
and
the
black
to
reform
each
other
speaking
of
pioneer
days
in
the
mighty
wilderness
of
queensland
praed
says
at
first
the
natives
retreated
before
the
whites
and
except
that
they
every
now
and
then
speared
a
beast
in
one
of
the
herds
gave
little
cause
for
uneasiness
but
as
the
number
of
squatters
increased
each
one
taking
up
miles
of
country
and
bringing
two
or
three
men
in
his
train
so
that
shepherds
huts
and
stockmen
camps
lay
far
apart
and
defenseless
in
the
midst
of
hostile
tribes
the
blacks
depredations
became
more
frequent
and
murder
was
no
unusual
event
the
loneliness
of
the
australian
bush
can
hardly
be
painted
in
words
here
extends
mile
after
mile
of
primeval
forest
where
perhaps
foot
of
white
man
has
never
trod
interminable
vistas
where
the
eucalyptus
trees
rear
their
lofty
trunks
and
spread
forth
their
lanky
limbs
from
which
the
red
gum
oozes
and
hangs
in
fantastic
pendants
like
crimson
stalactites
ravines
along
the
sides
of
which
the
grass
grows
rankly
level
untimbered
plains
alternating
with
undulating
tracts
of
pasture
here
and
there
broken
by
a
stony
ridge
steep
gully
or
creek
all
wild
vast
and
desolate
all
the
same
monotonous
gray
coloring
except
where
the
wattle
when
in
blossom
shows
patches
of
feathery
gold
or
a
belt
of
scrub
lies
green
glossy
and
impenetrable
as
indian
jungle
the
solitude
seems
intensified
by
the
strange
sounds
of
reptiles
birds
and
insects
and
by
the
absence
of
larger
creatures
of
which
in
the
the
only
audible
signs
are
the
stampede
of
a
herd
of
kangaroo
or
the
rustle
of
a
wallabi
or
a
dingo
stirring
the
grass
as
it
creeps
to
its
lair
but
there
are
the
whirring
of
locusts
the
demoniac
chuckle
of
the
laughing
the
screeching
of
cockatoos
and
parrots
the
hissing
of
the
frilled
lizard
and
the
buzzing
of
innumerable
insects
hidden
under
the
dense
undergrowth
and
then
at
night
the
melancholy
wailing
of
the
curlews
the
dismal
howling
of
dingoes
the
discordant
croaking
of
might
well
shake
the
nerves
of
the
solitary
watcher
that
is
the
theater
for
the
drama
when
you
comprehend
one
or
two
other
details
you
will
perceive
how
well
suited
for
trouble
it
was
and
how
loudly
it
invited
it
the
cattlemen
stations
were
scattered
over
that
profound
wilderness
miles
and
miles
apart
at
each
station
half
a
dozen
persons
there
was
a
plenty
of
cattle
the
black
natives
were
always
and
hungry
the
land
belonged
to
them
the
whites
had
not
bought
it
and
could
buy
it
for
the
tribes
had
no
chiefs
nobody
in
authority
nobody
competent
to
sell
and
convey
and
the
tribes
themselves
had
no
comprehension
of
the
idea
of
transferable
ownership
of
land
the
ousted
owners
were
despised
by
the
white
interlopers
and
this
opinion
was
not
hidden
under
a
bushel
more
promising
materials
for
a
tragedy
could
not
have
been
collated
let
praed
speak
at
nie
station
one
dark
night
the
unsuspecting
having
as
he
believed
secured
himself
against
assault
was
lying
wrapped
in
his
blankets
sleeping
profoundly
the
blacks
crept
stealthily
down
the
chimney
and
battered
in
his
skull
while
he
slept
one
could
guess
the
whole
drama
from
that
little
text
the
curtain
was
up
it
would
not
fall
until
the
mastership
of
one
party
or
the
other
was
determined
and
permanently
there
was
treachery
on
both
sides
the
blacks
killed
the
whites
when
they
found
them
defenseless
and
the
whites
slew
the
blacks
in
a
wholesale
and
promiscuous
fashion
which
offended
against
my
childish
sense
of
justice
they
were
regarded
as
little
above
the
level
of
brutes
and
in
some
cases
were
destroyed
like
vermin
here
is
an
instance
a
squatter
whose
station
was
surrounded
by
blacks
whom
he
suspected
to
be
hostile
and
from
whom
he
feared
an
attack
parleyed
with
them
from
his
he
told
them
it
was
a
time
at
which
all
men
black
or
white
feasted
that
there
were
flour
good
things
in
plenty
in
the
store
and
that
he
would
make
for
them
such
a
pudding
as
they
had
never
dreamed
of
a
great
pudding
of
which
all
might
eat
and
be
filled
the
blacks
listened
and
were
lost
the
pudding
was
made
and
distributed
next
morning
there
was
howling
in
the
camp
for
it
had
been
sweetened
with
sugar
and
arsenic
the
white
man
spirit
was
right
but
his
method
was
wrong
his
spirit
was
the
spirit
which
the
civilized
white
has
always
exhibited
toward
the
savage
but
the
use
of
poison
was
a
departure
from
custom
true
it
was
merely
a
technical
departure
not
a
real
one
still
it
was
a
departure
and
therefore
a
mistake
in
my
opinion
it
was
better
kinder
swifter
and
much
more
humane
than
a
number
of
the
methods
which
have
been
sanctified
by
custom
but
that
does
not
justify
its
employment
that
is
it
does
not
wholly
justify
it
its
unusual
nature
makes
it
stand
out
and
attract
an
amount
of
attention
which
it
is
not
entitled
to
it
takes
hold
upon
morbid
imaginations
and
they
work
it
up
into
a
sort
of
exhibition
of
cruelty
and
this
smirches
the
good
name
of
our
civilization
whereas
one
of
the
old
harsher
methods
would
have
had
no
such
effect
because
usage
has
made
those
methods
familiar
to
us
and
innocent
in
many
countries
we
have
chained
the
savage
and
starved
him
to
death
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
to
it
in
many
countries
we
have
burned
the
savage
at
the
stake
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
is
to
it
in
more
than
one
country
we
have
hunted
the
savage
and
his
little
children
and
their
mother
with
dogs
and
guns
through
the
woods
and
swamps
for
an
afternoon
sport
and
filled
the
region
with
happy
laughter
over
their
sprawling
and
stumbling
flight
and
their
wild
supplications
for
mercy
but
this
method
we
do
not
mind
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
to
it
in
many
countries
we
have
taken
the
savage
land
from
him
and
made
him
our
slave
and
lashed
him
every
day
and
broken
his
pride
and
made
death
his
only
friend
and
overworked
him
till
he
dropped
in
his
tracks
and
this
we
do
not
care
for
because
custom
has
inured
us
to
it
yet
a
quick
death
by
poison
is
to
it
in
the
matabeleland
today
why
there
we
are
confining
ourselves
to
sanctified
custom
we
millionaires
in
south
africa
and
dukes
in
london
and
nobody
cares
because
we
are
used
to
the
old
holy
customs
and
all
we
ask
is
that
no
new
ones
shall
be
intruded
upon
the
attention
of
our
comfortable
consciences
praed
says
of
the
poisoner
that
squatter
deserves
to
have
his
name
handed
down
to
the
contempt
of
posterity
i
am
sorry
to
hear
her
say
that
i
myself
blame
him
for
one
thing
and
severely
but
i
stop
there
i
blame
him
for
the
indiscretion
of
introducing
a
novelty
which
was
calculated
to
attract
attention
to
our
civilization
there
was
no
occasion
to
do
that
it
was
his
duty
and
it
is
every
loyal
man
duty
to
protect
that
heritage
in
every
way
he
can
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
to
attract
attention
elsewhere
the
squatter
judgment
was
bad
that
is
plain
but
his
heart
was
right
he
is
almost
the
only
pioneering
representative
of
civilization
in
history
who
has
risen
above
the
prejudices
of
his
caste
and
his
heredity
and
tried
to
introduce
the
element
of
mercy
into
the
superior
race
dealings
with
the
savage
his
name
is
lost
and
it
is
a
pity
for
it
deserves
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
with
homage
and
reverence

there

why

his

varieties
not

you
do
not

to

any

whatever
you
want
in
that

he

and
they
will
not

there

he

then
loves
her
faithfully
through

it

he

her

a

diversion
and
by

down

face
a

one

kill
another

the

he
likes

and
will
eat
his

he
is
a
sociable
animal
yet
he
turns
aside
and
hides
behind
his
shield
when
his
goes
by
he
is
childishly
afraid
of
ghosts
and
other
trivialities
that
menace
his
soul

dread
of

secret
baffled

defeated
the

theorizings
of

seventy
years

by
an
art

performs
miracles
with
it
which
the

can
not
approach
untaught
nor
parallel

within
certain
limits
this
savage
intellect
is
the
alertest
and
the
brightest
known

the

never
able
to

in

some
things
which
i
wish
to
condense
slightly

here
he
speaks
of
the
quickness
of
their
eyes
and
the
accuracy
of
their
judgment

extraordinary

in
avoiding

utmost
on
the
quickness
of
his
eye
and
his
agility
the
shield
was
the
customary
of
his
race
and
would
not
be
a
protection
to
you
or
to
me
it
is
no
broader
than
a
stovepipe
and
is
about
as
long
as
a
man
arm
the
opposing
surface
is
not
flat
but
slopes
away
from
the
centerline
like
a
boat
bow
the
difficulty
about
a
that
has
been
thrown
with
a
scientific
twist
is
that
it
suddenly
changes
it
course
when
it
is
close
to
its
target
and
comes
straight
for
the
mark
when
apparently
it
was
going
overhead
or
to
one
side
i
should
not
be
able
to
protect
myself
from
such
balls
for
or
less
chauncy
once
saw
a
little
native
man
throw
a
yards
this
is
said
to
beat
the
english
professional
record
by
thirteen
yards
we
have
all
seen
the
bound
into
the
air
from
a
and
make
a
somersault
over
eight
horses
standing
side
by
side
chauncy
saw
an
aboriginal
do
it
over
eleven
and
was
assured
that
he
had
sometimes
done
it
over
fourteen
but
what
is
that
to
this
i
saw
the
same
man
leap
from
the
ground
and
in
going
over
he
dipped
his
head
unaided
by
his
hands
into
a
hat
placed
in
an
inverted
position
on
the
top
of
the
head
of
another
man
sitting
upright
on
horseback
both
man
and
horse
being
of
the
average
size
the
native
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
horse
with
the
hat
fairly
on
his
head
the
prodigious
height
of
the
leap
and
the
precision
with
which
it
was
taken
so
as
to
enable
him
to
dip
his
head
into
the
hat
exceeded
any
feat
of
the
kind
i
have
ever
beheld
i
should
think
so
on
board
a
ship
lately
i
saw
a
young
oxford
athlete
run
four
steps
and
spring
into
the
air
and
squirm
his
hips
by
a
over
a
bar
that
was
five
and
feet
high
but
he
could
not
have
stood
still
and
cleared
a
bar
that
was
four
feet
high
i
know
this
because
i
tried
it
myself
one
can
see
now
where
the
kangaroo
learned
its
art
sir
george
grey
and
eyre
testify
that
the
natives
dug
wells
fourteen
or
fifteen
feet
deep
and
two
feet
in
diameter
at
the
bore
dug
them
in
the
sand
wells
that
were
quite
circular
carried
straight
down
and
the
work
beautifully
executed
their
tools
were
their
hands
and
feet
how
did
they
throw
sand
out
from
such
a
depth
how
could
they
stoop
down
and
get
it
with
only
two
feet
of
space
to
stoop
in
how
did
they
keep
that
from
caving
in
on
them
i
do
not
know
still
they
did
manage
those
seeming
impossibilities
swallowed
the
sand
may
be
chauncy
speaks
highly
of
the
patience
and
skill
and
alert
intelligence
of
the
native
huntsman
when
he
is
stalking
the
emu
the
kangaroo
and
other
game
as
he
walks
through
the
bush
his
step
is
light
elastic
and
noiseless
every
track
on
the
earth
catches
his
keen
eye
a
leaf
or
fragment
of
a
stick
turned
or
a
blade
of
grass
recently
bent
by
the
tread
of
one
of
the
lower
animals
instantly
arrests
his
attention
in
fact
nothing
escapes
his
quick
and
powerful
sight
on
the
ground
in
the
trees
or
in
the
distance
which
may
supply
him
with
a
meal
or
warn
him
of
danger
a
little
examination
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
which
may
be
nearly
covered
with
the
scratches
of
opossums
ascending
and
descending
is
sufficient
to
inform
him
whether
one
went
up
the
night
before
without
coming
down
again
or
not
fennimore
cooper
lost
his
chance
he
would
have
known
how
to
value
these
people
he
would
have
traded
the
dullest
of
them
for
the
brightest
mohawk
he
ever
invented
all
savages
draw
outline
pictures
upon
bark
but
the
resemblances
are
not
close
and
expression
is
usually
lacking
but
the
australian
aboriginal
pictures
of
animals
were
nicely
accurate
in
form
attitude
carriage
and
he
put
spirit
into
them
and
expression
and
his
pictures
of
white
people
and
natives
were
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
his
pictures
of
the
other
animals
he
dressed
his
whites
in
the
fashion
of
their
day
both
the
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
as
an
untaught
wielder
of
the
pencil
it
is
not
likely
that
he
has
had
his
equal
among
savage
people
his
place
in
art
as
to
drawing
not
is
well
up
all
things
considered
his
art
is
not
to
be
classified
with
savage
art
at
all
but
on
a
plane
two
degrees
above
it
and
one
degree
above
the
lowest
plane
of
civilized
art
to
be
exact
his
place
in
art
is
between
botticelli
and
de
maurier
that
is
to
say
he
could
not
draw
as
well
as
de
maurier
but
better
than
boticelli
in
feeling
he
resembles
both
also
in
grouping
and
in
his
preferences
in
the
matter
of
subjects
his
corrobboree
of
the
australian
wilds
reappears
in
de
maurier
belgravian
ballrooms
with
clothes
and
the
smirk
of
civilization
added
botticelli
spring
is
the
corrobboree
further
idealized
but
with
fewer
clothes
and
more
smirk
and
well
enough
as
to
intention
but
my
word
the
aboriginal
can
make
a
fire
by
friction
i
have
tried
that
all
savages
are
able
to
stand
a
good
deal
of
physical
pain
the
australian
aboriginal
has
this
quality
in
a
degree
do
not
read
the
following
instances
if
horrors
are
not
pleasant
to
you
they
were
recorded
by
the
rev
henry
wolloston
of
melbourne
who
had
been
a
surgeon
before
he
became
a
clergyman
in
the
summer
of
i
started
on
horseback
from
albany
king
george
sound
to
visit
at
cape
riche
accompanied
by
a
native
on
foot
we
traveled
about
forty
miles
the
first
day
then
camped
by
a
for
the
night
after
cooking
and
eating
our
supper
i
observed
the
native
who
had
said
nothing
to
me
on
the
subject
collect
the
hot
embers
of
the
fire
together
and
deliberately
place
his
right
foot
in
the
glowing
mass
for
a
moment
then
suddenly
withdraw
it
stamping
on
the
ground
and
uttering
a
guttural
sound
of
mingled
pain
and
satisfaction
this
operation
he
repeated
several
times
on
my
inquiring
the
meaning
of
his
strange
conduct
he
only
said
am
mending
my
foot
and
then
showed
me
his
charred
great
toe
the
nail
of
which
had
been
torn
off
by
a
stump
in
which
it
had
been
caught
during
the
journey
and
the
pain
of
which
he
had
borne
with
stoical
composure
until
the
evening
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
cauterizing
the
wound
in
the
primitive
manner
above
described
and
he
proceeded
on
the
journey
the
next
day
as
if
nothing
had
happened
and
walked
thirty
miles
it
was
a
strange
idea
to
keep
a
surgeon
and
then
do
his
own
surgery
a
native
about
years
of
age
once
applied
to
me
as
a
doctor
to
extract
the
wooden
barb
of
a
spear
which
during
a
fight
in
the
bush
some
four
months
previously
had
entered
his
chest
just
missing
the
heart
and
penetrated
the
viscera
to
a
considerable
depth
the
spear
had
been
cut
off
leaving
the
barb
behind
which
continued
to
force
its
way
by
muscular
action
gradually
toward
the
back
and
when
i
examined
him
i
could
feel
a
hard
substance
between
the
ribs
below
the
left
i
made
a
deep
incision
and
with
a
pair
of
forceps
extracted
the
barb
which
was
made
as
usual
of
hard
wood
about
four
inches
long
and
from
half
an
inch
to
an
inch
thick
it
was
very
smooth
and
partly
digested
so
to
speak
by
the
maceration
to
which
it
had
been
exposed
during
its
four
months
journey
through
the
body
the
wound
made
by
the
spear
had
long
since
healed
leaving
only
a
small
cicatrix
and
after
the
operation
which
the
native
bore
without
flinching
he
appeared
to
suffer
no
pain
indeed
judging
from
his
good
state
of
health
the
presence
of
the
foreign
matter
did
not
materially
annoy
him
he
was
perfectly
well
in
a
few
days
but
no
is
my
favorite
whenever
i
read
it
i
seem
to
enjoy
all
that
the
patient
enjoyed
whatever
it
was
once
at
king
george
sound
a
native
presented
himself
to
me
with
one
leg
only
and
requested
me
to
supply
him
with
a
wooden
leg
he
had
traveled
in
this
maimed
state
about
miles
for
this
purpose
i
examined
the
limb
which
had
been
severed
just
below
the
knee
and
found
that
it
had
been
charred
by
fire
while
about
two
inches
of
the
partially
calcined
bone
protruded
through
the
flesh
i
at
once
removed
this
with
the
saw
and
having
made
as
presentable
a
stump
of
it
as
i
could
covered
the
amputated
end
of
the
bone
with
a
surrounding
of
muscle
and
kept
the
patient
a
few
days
under
my
care
to
allow
the
wound
to
heal
on
inquiring
the
native
told
me
that
in
a
fight
with
other
a
spear
had
struck
his
leg
and
penetrated
the
bone
below
the
knee
finding
it
was
serious
he
had
recourse
to
the
following
crude
and
barbarous
operation
which
it
appears
is
not
uncommon
among
these
people
in
their
native
state
he
made
a
fire
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
earth
only
sufficiently
large
to
admit
his
leg
and
deep
enough
to
allow
the
wounded
part
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
surface
of
the
ground
he
then
surrounded
the
limb
with
the
live
coals
or
charcoal
which
was
replenished
until
the
leg
was
literally
burnt
off
the
cauterization
thus
applied
completely
checked
the
hemorrhage
and
he
was
able
in
a
day
or
two
to
hobble
down
to
the
sound
with
the
aid
of
a
long
stout
stick
although
he
was
more
than
a
week
on
the
road
but
he
was
a
fastidious
native
he
soon
discarded
the
wooden
leg
made
for
him
by
the
doctor
because
it
had
no
feeling
in
it
it
must
have
had
as
much
as
the
one
he
burnt
off
i
should
think
so
much
for
the
aboriginals
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
let
them
alone
they
are
marvelously
interesting
creatures
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
now
the
several
colonial
governments
have
housed
their
remnants
in
comfortable
stations
and
fed
them
well
and
taken
good
care
of
them
in
every
way
if
i
had
found
this
out
while
i
was
in
australia
i
could
have
seen
some
of
those
people
but
i
did

of
its
own
this
is
a

the
vast
cattle

industries
the
strange
aspects
of
the
country
and
the
strange
native

brute

are
matters
which
would
naturally
breed
a
local

i
have
notes
of
this

somewhere
but
at
the
moment
i
can
call
to
mind
only
a
few
of
the
words
and
phrases
they
are

have
created

with

shift

under
such
conditions
would
have
been
a
sweltering
and
prostrating
experience
but
there
was
nothing
of
that
in
this
case
it
is
a
climate
that
is
perfect
there
was
no

indeed
there

the

was

had

i
think
we
should
not
have
felt
any
discomfort

me

yards
wide
between

fences
i
was
not
given
the
width
in
yards
but
only
in
chains
and
perches

furlongs
i
think
i
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
know
what
the
width
was
but
i
did
not
pursue
the
matter
i
think
it
is
best
to
put
up
with
information
the
way
you
get
it
and
seem
satisfied
with
it
and
surprised
at
it

grateful
for
it

never

i
could
tell
you
how
wide
in

furlongs
and
things
but
that
would
not
help
you
any
those
things
sound
well

they
are
shadowy

asks
you

yes

shift

wide
space
dates
from
the
earliest
sheep
and
days
people
had
to
drive
their
stock
long
distances
immense
journeys
from
places
to
new
ones
where
were
water
and
fresh
pasturage
and
this
wide
space
had
to
be
left
in
grass
and
unfenced
or
the
stock
would
have
starved
to
death
in
the
transit
on
the
way
we
saw
the
usual
birds
the
beautiful
little
green
parrots
the
magpie
and
some
others
and
also
the
slender
native
bird
of
modest
plumage
and
the
name
the
bird
that
is
the
smartest
among
birds
and
can
give
a
parrot
to
in
the
game
and
then
talk
him
to
death
i
can
not
recall
that
bird
name
i
think
it
begins
with
i
wish
it
began
with
or
something
that
a
person
can
remember
the
magpie
was
out
in
great
force
in
the
fields
and
on
the
fences
he
is
a
handsome
large
creature
with
snowy
white
decorations
and
is
a
singer
he
has
a
murmurous
rich
note
that
is
lovely
he
was
once
modest
even
diffident
but
he
lost
all
that
when
he
found
out
that
he
was
australia
sole
musical
bird
he
has
talent
and
cuteness
and
impudence
and
in
his
tame
state
he
is
a
most
satisfactory
pet
never
coming
when
he
is
called
always
coming
when
he
is
and
studying
disobedience
as
an
accomplishment
he
is
not
confined
but
loafs
all
over
the
house
and
grounds
like
the
laughing
jackass
i
think
he
learns
to
talk
i
know
he
learns
to
sing
tunes
and
his
friends
say
that
he
knows
how
to
steal
without
learning
i
was
acquainted
with
a
tame
magpie
in
melbourne
he
had
lived
in
a
lady
house
several
years
and
believed
he
owned
it
the
lady
had
tamed
him
and
in
return
he
had
tamed
the
lady
he
was
always
on
deck
when
not
wanted
always
having
his
own
way
always
tyrannizing
over
the
dog
and
always
making
the
cat
life
a
slow
sorrow
and
a
martyrdom
he
knew
a
number
of
tunes
and
could
sing
them
in
perfect
time
and
tune
and
would
do
it
too
at
any
time
that
silence
was
wanted
and
then
encore
himself
and
do
it
again
but
if
he
was
asked
to
sing
he
would
go
out
and
take
a
walk
it
was
long
believed
that
fruit
trees
would
not
grow
in
that
baked
and
waterless
plain
around
horsham
but
the
agricultural
college
has
dissipated
that
idea
its
ample
nurseries
were
producing
oranges
apricots
lemons
almonds
peaches
cherries
varieties
of
apples
in
fact
all
manner
of
fruits
and
in
abundance
the
trees
did
not
seem
to
miss
the
water
they
were
in
vigorous
and
flourishing
condition
experiments
are
made
with
different
soils
to
see
what
things
thrive
best
in
them
and
what
climates
are
best
for
them
a
man
who
is
ignorantly
trying
to
produce
upon
his
farm
things
not
suited
to
its
soil
and
its
other
conditions
can
make
a
journey
to
the
college
from
anywhere
in
australia
and
go
back
with
a
change
of
scheme
which
will
make
his
farm
productive
and
profitable
there
were
forty
pupils
there
a
few
of
them
farmers
relearning
their
trade
the
rest
young
men
mainly
from
the
cities
novices
it
seemed
a
strange
thing
that
an
agricultural
college
should
have
an
attraction
for
youths
but
such
is
the
fact
they
are
good
stuff
too
they
are
above
the
agricultural
average
of
intelligence
and
they
come
without
any
inherited
prejudices
in
favor
of
hoary
ignorances
made
sacred
by
long
descent
the
students
work
all
day
in
the
fields
the
nurseries
and
the
learning
and
doing
all
the
practical
work
of
the
business
three
days
in
a
week
on
the
other
three
they
study
and
hear
lectures
they
are
taught
the
beginnings
of
such
sciences
as
bear
upon
agriculture
like
chemistry
for
instance
we
saw
the
sophomore
class
in
shear
a
dozen
sheep
they
did
it
by
hand
not
with
the
machine
the
sheep
was
seized
and
flung
down
on
his
side
and
held
there
and
the
students
took
off
his
coat
with
great
celerity
and
adroitness
sometimes
they
clipped
off
a
sample
of
the
sheep
but
that
is
customary
with
shearers
and
they
do
mind
it
they
do
even
mind
it
as
much
as
the
sheep
they
dab
a
splotch
of
on
the
place
and
go
right
ahead
the
coat
of
wool
was
unbelievably
thick
before
the
shearing
the
sheep
looked
like
the
fat
woman
in
the
circus
after
it
he
looked
like
a
bench
he
was
clipped
to
the
skin
and
smoothly
and
uniformly
the
fleece
comes
from
him
all
in
one
piece
and
has
the
spread
of
a
blanket
the
college
was
flying
the
australian
flag
the
gridiron
of
england
smuggled
up
in
the
northwest
corner
of
a
big
red
field
that
had
the
random
stars
of
the
southern
cross
wandering
around
over
it
from
horsham
we
went
to
stawell
by
rail
still
in
the
colony
of
victoria
stawell
is
in
the
country
in
the
was
half
a
peck
of
gold
dust
grain
gold
rich
pure
in
fact
and
pleasant
to
sift
through
one
fingers
and
would
be
pleasanter
if
it
would
stick
and
there
were
a
couple
of
gold
bricks
very
heavy
to
handle
and
worth
a
piece
they
were
from
a
very
valuable
quartz
mine
a
lady
owns
of
it
she
has
an
income
of
a
month
from
it
and
is
able
to
keep
house
the
stawell
region
is
not
productive
of
gold
only
it
has
great
vineyards
and
produces
exceptionally
fine
wines
one
of
these
vineyards
the
great
western
owned
by
irving
is
regarded
as
a
model
its
product
has
reputation
abroad
it
yields
a
choice
champagne
and
a
fine
claret
and
its
hock
took
a
prize
in
france
two
or
three
years
ago
the
champagne
is
kept
in
a
maze
of
passages
under
ground
cut
in
the
rock
to
secure
it
an
even
temperature
during
the
term
required
to
perfect
it
in
those
vaults
i
saw
bottles
of
champagne
the
colony
of
victoria
has
a
population
of
and
those
people
are
said
to
drink
bottles
of
champagne
per
year
the
dryest
community
on
the
earth
the
government
has
lately
reduced
the
duty
upon
foreign
wines
that
is
one
of
the
unkindnesses
of
protection
a
man
invests
years
of
work
and
a
vast
sum
of
money
in
a
worthy
enterprise
upon
the
faith
of
existing
laws
then
the
law
is
changed
and
the
man
is
robbed
by
his
own
government
on
the
way
back
to
stawell
we
had
a
chance
to
see
a
group
of
boulders
called
the
three
sisters
a
curiosity
oddly
located
for
it
was
upon
high
ground
with
the
land
sloping
away
from
it
and
no
height
above
it
from
whence
the
boulders
could
have
rolled
down
relics
of
an
early
perhaps
they
are
noble
boulders
one
of
them
has
the
size
and
smoothness
and
plump
sphericity
of
a
balloon
of
the
biggest
pattern
the
road
led
through
a
forest
of
great
lean
and
scraggy
and
sorrowful
the
road
was
a
clayey
kind
of
earth
apparently
along
it
toiled
occasional
freight
wagons
drawn
by
long
double
files
of
oxen
those
wagons
were
going
a
journey
of
two
hundred
miles
i
was
told
and
were
running
a
successful
opposition
to
the
railway
the
railways
are
owned
and
run
by
the
government
those
sad
gums
stood
up
out
of
the
dry
white
clay
pictures
of
patience
and
resignation
it
is
a
tree
that
can
get
along
without
water
still
it
is
fond
of
it
ravenously
so
it
is
a
very
intelligent
tree
and
will
detect
the
presence
of
hidden
water
at
a
distance
of
fifty
feet
and
send
out
slender
long
to
prospect
it
they
will
find
it
and
will
also
get
at
it
even
through
a
cement
wall
six
inches
thick
once
a
cement
under
ground
at
stawell
began
to
gradually
reduce
its
output
and
finally
ceased
altogether
to
deliver
water
upon
examining
into
the
matter
it
was
found
stopped
up
wadded
compactly
with
a
mass
of
delicate
and
how
this
stuff
had
gotten
into
the
pipe
was
a
puzzle
for
some
little
time
finally
it
was
found
that
it
had
crept
in
through
a
crack
that
was
almost
invisible
to
the
eye
a
gum
tree
forty
feet
away
had
tapped
the
pipe
and
was
drinking

water

in

one
has
of
an
unfamiliar
sort
we
had
this
kind
of
scenery
finely
staged
all
the
way
to
ballarat
consequently
we
saw
more
sky
than
country
on
that
journey
at
one
time
a
great
stretch
of
the
vault
was
densely
flecked
with
wee
flakes
of
painfully
white
all
of
one
shape
and
size
and
equidistant
apart
with
narrow
cracks
of
adorable
blue
showing
between
the
whole
was
suggestive
of
a
hurricane
of
drifting
across
the
skies
by
and
by
these
flakes
fused
themselves
together
in
interminable
lines
with
shady
faint
hollows
between
the
lines
the
long
rollers
following
each
other
in
simulated
movement
and
enchantingly
counterfeiting
the
majestic
march
of
a
flowing
sea
later
the
sea
solidified
itself
then
gradually
broke
up
its
mass
into
innumerable
lofty
white
pillars
of
about
one
size
and
ranged
these
across
the
firmament
in
receding
and
fading
perspective
in
the
similitude
of
a
stupendous
colonnade
a
mirage
without
a
doubt
flung
from
the
far
gates
of
the
hereafter
the
approaches
to
ballarat
were
beautiful
the
features
great
green
expanses
of
rolling
bisected
by
eye
contenting
hedges
of
commingled
and
gorse
and
a
lovely
lake
one
must
put
in
the
pause
there
to
fetch
the
reader
up
with
a
slight
jolt
and
keep
him
from
gliding
by
without
noticing
the
lake
one
must
notice
it
for
a
lovely
lake
is
not
as
common
a
thing
along
the
railways
of
australia
as
are
the
dry
places
in
the
shade
again
but
balmy
and
comfortable
fresh
and
bracing

perfect
climate
years
ago
the
site
now
occupied
by
the
city
of
ballarat
was
a
sylvan
solitude
as
quiet
as
eden
and
as
lovely
nobody
had
ever
heard
of
it
on
the
of
august
the
first
great
made
in
australia
was
made
here
the
wandering
prospectors
who
made
it
scraped
up
two
pounds
and
a
half
of
gold
the
first
a
few
days
later
the
place
was
a
hive
a
town
the
news
of
the
strike
spread
everywhere
in
a
sort
of
instantaneous
way
spread
like
a
flash
to
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
a
celebrity
so
prompt
and
so
universal
has
hardly
been
paralleled
in
history
perhaps
it
was
as
if
the
name
ballarat
had
suddenly
been
written
on
the
sky
where
all
the
world
could
read
it
at
once
the
smaller
discoveries
made
in
the
colony
of
new
south
wales
three
months
before
had
already
started
emigrants
toward
australia
they
had
been
coming
as
a
stream
but
they
came
as
a
flood
now
a
hundred
thousand
people
poured
into
melbourne
from
england
and
other
countries
in
a
single
month
and
flocked
away
to
the
mines
the
crews
of
the
ships
that
brought
them
flocked
with
them
the
clerks
in
the
government
offices
followed
so
did
the
cooks
the
maids
the
coachmen
the
butlers
and
the
other
domestic
servants
so
did
the
carpenters
the
smiths
the
plumbers
the
painters
the
reporters
the
editors
the
lawyers
the
clients
the
barkeepers
the
bummers
the
blacklegs
the
thieves
the
loose
women
the
grocers
the
butchers
the
bakers
the
doctors
the
druggists
the
nurses
so
did
the
police
even
officials
of
high
and
hitherto
envied
place
threw
up
their
positions
and
joined
the
procession
this
roaring
avalanche
swept
out
of
melbourne
and
left
it
desolate
paralyzed
everything
at
a
the
ships
lying
idle
at
anchor
all
signs
of
life
departed
all
sounds
stilled
save
the
rasping
of
the
as
they
scraped
across
the
vacant
streets
that
grassy
and
leafy
paradise
at
ballarat
was
soon
ripped
open
and
lacerated
and
scarified
and
gutted
in
the
feverish
search
for
its
hidden
riches
there
is
nothing
like
to
snatch
the
graces
and
beauties
and
benignities
out
of
a
paradise
and
make
an
odious
and
repulsive
spectacle
of
it
what
fortunes
were
made
immigrants
got
rich
while
the
ship
unloaded
and
reloaded
and
went
back
home
for
good
in
the
same
cabin
they
had
come
out
in
not
all
of
them
only
some
i
saw
the
others
in
ballarat
myself
years
later
what
were
left
of
them
by
time
and
death
and
the
disposition
to
rove
they
were
young
and
gay
then
they
are
patriarchal
and
grave
now
and
they
do
not
get
excited
any
more
they
talk
of
the
past
they
live
in
it
their
life
is
a
dream
a
retrospection
ballarat
was
a
great
region
for
nuggets
no
such
nuggets
were
found
in
california
as
ballarat
produced
in
fact
the
ballarat
region
has
yielded
the
largest
ones
known
to
history
two
of
them
weighed
about
pounds
each
and
together
were
worth
they
were
offered
to
any
poor
person
who
would
shoulder
them
and
carry
them
away
gold
was
so
plentiful
that
it
made
people
liberal
like
that
ballarat
was
a
swarming
city
of
tents
in
the
early
days
everybody
was
happy
for
a
time
and
apparently
prosperous
then
came
trouble
the
government
swooped
down
with
a
mining
tax
and
in
its
worst
form
too
for
it
was
not
a
tax
upon
what
the
miner
had
taken
out
but
upon
what
he
was
going
to
take
out
if
he
could
find
it
it
was
a
license
to
work
his
claim
and
it
had
to
be
paid
before
he
could
begin
digging
consider
the
situation
no
business
is
so
uncertain
as
your
claim
may
be
good
and
it
may
be
worthless
it
may
make
you
well
off
in
a
month
and
then
again
you
may
have
to
dig
and
slave
for
half
a
year
at
heavy
expense
only
to
find
out
at
last
that
the
gold
is
not
there
in
quantity
and
that
your
time
and
your
hard
work
have
been
thrown
away
it
might
be
wise
policy
to
advance
the
miner
a
monthly
sum
to
encourage
him
to
develop
the
country
riches
but
to
tax
him
monthly
in
advance
instead
why
such
a
thing
was
never
dreamed
of
in
america
there
neither
the
claim
itself
nor
its
products
howsoever
rich
or
poor
were
taxed
the
ballarat
miners
protested
petitioned
complained
it
was
of
no
use
the
government
held
its
ground
and
went
on
collecting
the
tax
and
not
by
pleasant
methods
but
by
ways
which
must
have
been
very
galling
to
free
people
the
rumblings
of
a
coming
storm
began
to
be
audible
by
and
by
there
was
a
result
and
i
think
it
may
be
called
the
finest
thing
in
australasian
history
it
was
a
revolution
small
in
size
but
great
politically
it
was
a
strike
for
liberty
a
struggle
for
a
principle
a
stand
against
injustice
and
oppression
it
was
the
barons
and
john
over
again
it
was
hampden
and
it
was
concord
and
lexington
small
beginnings
all
of
them
but
all
of
them
great
in
political
results
all
of
them
it
is
another
instance
of
a
victory
won
by
a
lost
battle
it
adds
an
honorable
page
to
history
the
people
know
it
and
are
proud
of
it
they
keep
green
the
memory
of
the
men
who
fell
at
the
eureka
stockade
and
peter
lalor
has
his
monument
the
of
ballarat
was
full
of
gold
this
soil
the
miners
ripped
and
tore
and
trenched
and
harried
and
disembowled
and
made
it
yield
up
its
immense
treasure
then
they
went
down
into
the
earth
with
deep
shafts
seeking
the
gravelly
beds
of
ancient
rivers
and
brooks
and
found
them
they
followed
the
courses
of
these
streams
and
gutted
them
sending
the
gravel
up
in
buckets
to
the
upper
world
and
washing
out
of
it
its
enormous
deposits
of
gold
the
next
biggest
of
the
two
monster
nuggets
mentioned
above
came
from
an
old
feet
under
ground
finally
the
quartz
lodes
were
attacked
that
is
not
mining
and
milling
require
capital
and
and
patience
big
companies
were
formed
and
for
several
decades
now
the
lodes
have
been
successfully
worked
and
have
yielded
great
wealth
since
the
gold
discovery
in
the
ballarat
mines
taking
the
three
kinds
of
mining
together
have
contributed
to
the
world
pocket
something
over
three
hundred
millions
of
dollars
which
is
to
say
that
this
nearly
invisible
little
spot
on
the
earth
surface
has
yielded
about
as
much
gold
in
years
as
all
california
has
yielded
in
the
californian
aggregate
from
to
inclusive
as
reported
by
the
statistician
of
the
united
states
mint
is
a
citizen
told
me
a
curious
thing
about
those
mines
with
all
my
experience
of
mining
i
had
never
heard
of
anything
of
the
sort
before
the
main
gold
reef
runs
about
north
and
south
of
course
for
that
is
the
custom
of
a
rich
gold
reef
at
ballarat
its
course
is
between
walls
of
slate
now
the
citizen
told
me
that
throughout
a
stretch
of
twelve
miles
along
the
reef
the
reef
is
crossed
at
intervals
by
a
straight
black
streak
of
a
carbonaceous
nature
a
streak
in
the
slate
a
streak
no
thicker
than
a
pencil
and
that
wherever
it
crosses
the
reef
you
will
certainly
find
gold
at
the
junction
it
is
called
the
indicator
thirty
feet
on
each
side
of
the
indicator
and
down
in
the
slate
of
course
is
a
still
finer
streak
a
streak
as
fine
as
a
pencil
mark
and
indeed
that
is
its
name
pencil
mark
whenever
you
find
the
pencil
mark
you
know
that
thirty
feet
from
it
is
the
indicator
you
measure
the
distance
excavate
find
the
indicator
trace
it
straight
to
the
reef
and
sink
your
shaft
your
fortune
is
made
for
certain
if
that
is
true
it
is
curious
and
it
is
curious
anyway
ballarat
is
a
town
of
only
population
and
yet
since
it
is
in
australia
it
has
every
essential
of
an
advanced
and
enlightened
big
city
this
is
pure
matter
of
course
i
must
stop
dwelling
upon
these
things
it
is
hard
to
keep
from
dwelling
upon
them
though
for
it
is
difficult
to
get
away
from
the
surprise
of
it
i
will
let
the
other
details
go
this
time
but
i
must
allow
myself
to
mention
that
this
little
town
has
a
park
of
acres
a
flower
garden
of
acres
with
an
elaborate
and
expensive
fernery
in
it
and
some
costly
and
unusually
fine
statuary
and
an
artificial
lake
covering
acres
equipped
with
a
fleet
of
shells
small
sail
boats
and
little
steam
yachts
at
this
point
i
strike
out
some
other
praiseful
things
which
i
was
tempted
to
add
i
do
not
strike
them
out
because
they
were
not
true
or
not
well
said
but
because
i
find
them
better
said
by
another
man
and
a
man
more
competent
to
testify
too
because
he
belongs
on
the
ground
and
knows
i
clip
them
from
a
chatty
speech
delivered
some
years
ago
by
william
little
who
was
at
that
time
mayor
of
ballarat
the
language
of
our
citizens
in
this
as
in
other
parts
of
australasia
is
mostly
healthy
free
from
americanisms
vulgarisms
and
the
conflicting
dialects
of
our
fatherland
and
is
pure
enough
to
suit
a
trench
or
a
latham
our
youth
aided
by
climatic
influence
are
in
point
of
physique
and
comeliness
unsurpassed
in
the
sunny
south
our
young
men
are
well
ordered
and
our
maidens
stepping
over
the
bounds
of
modesty
are
as
fair
as
psyches
dispensing
smiles
as
charming
as
november
flowers
the
closing
clause
has
the
seeming
of
a
rather
frosty
compliment
but
that
is
apparent
only
not
real
november
is
there
his
compliment
to
the
local
purity
of
the
language
is
warranted
it
is
quite
free
from
impurities
this
is
acknowledged
far
and
wide
as
in
the
german
empire
all
cultivated
people
claim
to
speak
hanovarian
german
so
in
australasia
all
cultivated
people
claim
to
speak
ballarat
english
even
in
england
this
cult
has
made
considerable
progress
and
now
that
it
is
favored
by
the
two
great
universities
the
time
is
not
far
away
when
ballarat
english
will
come
into
general
use
among
the
educated
classes
of
great
britain
at
large
its
great
merit
is
that
it
is
shorter
than
ordinary
english
that
is
it
is
more
compressed
at
first
you
have
some
difficulty
in
understanding
it
when
it
is
spoken
as
rapidly
as
the
orator
whom
i
have
quoted
speaks
it
an
illustration
will
show
what
i
mean
when
he
called
and
i
handed
him
a
chair
he
bowed
and
said
q
presently
when
we
were
lighting
our
cigars
he
held
a
match
to
mine
and
i
said
thank
you
and
he
said
km
then
i
saw
is
the
end
of
the
phrase
i
thank
you
is
the
end
of
the
phrase
you
are
welcome
little
puts
no
emphasis
upon
either
of
them
but
delivers
them
so
reduced
that
they
hardly
have
a
sound
all
ballarat
english
is
like
that
and
the
effect
is
very
soft
and
pleasant
it
takes
all
the
hardness
and
harshness
out
of
our
tongue
and
gives
to
it
a
delicate
whispery
and
vanishing
cadence
which
charms
the
ear
like
the
faint
rustling
of
the
forest
leaves

got
up
at

at
soon
reached
castlemaine
one
of
the
rich
of
the
early
days
waited
several
hours
for
a
train
left
at
and
reached
bendigo
in
an
hour
for
comrade
a
catholic
priest
who
was
better
than
i
was
but
did
seem
to
know
it
a
man
full
of
graces
of
the
heart
the
mind
and
the
spirit
a
lovable
man
he
will
rise
he
will
be
a
bishop
some
day
later
an
archbishop
later
a
cardinal
finally
an
archangel
i
hope
and
then
he
will
recall
me
when
i
say
do
you
remember
that
trip
we
made
from
ballarat
to
bendigo
when
you
were
nothing
but
father
and
i
was
nothing
to
what
i
am
now
it
has
actually
taken
nine
hours
to
come
from
ballarat
to
bendigo
we
could
have
saved
seven
by
walking
however
there
was
no
hurry
bendigo
was
another
of
the
rich
strikes
of
the
early
days
it
does
a
great
business
now
that
business
which
more
than
any
other
that
i
know
of
teaches
patience
and
requires
grit
and
a
steady
nerve
the
town
is
full
of
towering
and
and
looks
like
a
speaking
of
patience
for
example
one
of
the
local
companies
went
steadily
on
with
its
deep
borings
and
searchings
without
show
of
gold
or
a
penny
of
reward
for
eleven
years
then
struck
it
and
became
suddenly
rich
the
eleven
years
work
had
cost
and
the
first
gold
found
was
a
grain
the
size
of
a
head
it
is
kept
under
locks
and
bars
as
a
precious
thing
and
is
reverently
shown
to
the
visitor
hats
off
when
i
saw
it
i
had
not
heard
its
history
it
is
gold
examine
it
take
the
glass
now
how
much
should
you
say
it
is
worth
i
said
i
should
say
about
two
cents
or
in
your
english
dialect
four
farthings
well
it
cost
oh
come
yes
it
did
ballarat
and
bendigo
have
produced
the
three
monumental
nuggets
of
the
world
and
this
one
is
the
monumentalest
one
of
the
three
the
other
two
represent
a
piece
this
one
a
couple
of
thousand
more
it
is
small
and
not
much
to
look
at
but
it
is
entitled
to
its
name
adam
it
is
the
of
this
mine
and
its
children
run
up
into
the
millions
speaking
of
patience
again
another
of
the
mines
was
worked
under
heavy
expenses
during
years
before
pay
was
struck
and
still
another
one
compelled
a
wait
of
years
before
pay
was
struck
then
in
both
instances
the
outlay
was
all
back
in
a
year
or
two
with
compound
interest
bendigo
has
turned
out
even
more
gold
than
ballarat
the
two
together
have
produced
worth
which
is
half
as
much
as
california
has
produced
it
was
through
blank
not
to
go
into
particulars
about
his
name
it
was
mainly
through
blank
that
my
stay
in
bendigo
was
made
memorably
pleasant
and
interesting
he
explained
this
to
me
himself
he
told
me
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
the
city
government
invited
me
to
the
to
hear
complimentary
speeches
and
respond
to
them
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
had
been
taken
on
a
long
through
the
city
and
shown
its
notable
features
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
was
invited
to
visit
the
great
mines
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
i
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
allowed
to
see
the
convalescent
chinaman
who
had
been
attacked
at
midnight
in
his
lonely
hut
eight
weeks
before
by
robbers
and
stabbed
times
and
scalped
besides
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
when
i
arrived
this
awful
spectacle
of
piecings
and
patchings
and
bandagings
was
sitting
up
in
his
cot
letting
on
to
read
one
of
my
books
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
the
catholic
archbishop
of
bendigo
to
invite
me
to
dinner
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
efforts
had
been
made
to
get
the
anglican
bishop
of
bendigo
to
ask
me
to
supper
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
the
dean
of
the
editorial
fraternity
had
driven
me
through
the
woodsy
outlying
country
and
shown
me
from
the
summit
of
lone
tree
hill
the
mightiest
and
loveliest
expanse
of
mountain
and
valley
that
i
had
seen
in
all
australia
and
when
he
asked
me
what
had
most
impressed
me
in
bendigo
and
i
answered
and
said
it
was
the
taste
and
the
public
spirit
which
had
adorned
the
streets
with
miles
of
shade
trees
he
said
that
it
was
through
his
influence
that
it
had
been
done
but
i
am
not
representing
him
quite
correctly
he
did
not
say
it
was
through
his
influence
that
all
these
things
had
happened
for
that
would
have
been
coarse
be
merely
conveyed
that
idea
conveyed
it
so
subtly
that
i
only
caught
it
fleetingly
as
one
catches
vagrant
faint
breaths
of
perfume
when
one
traverses
the
meadows
in
summer
conveyed
it
without
offense
and
without
any
suggestion
of
egoism
or
ostentation
but
conveyed
it
nevertheless
he
was
an
irishman
an
educated
gentleman
grave
and
kindly
and
courteous
a
bachelor
and
about
or
possibly
fifty
years
old
apparently
he
called
upon
me
at
the
hotel
and
it
was
there
that
we
had
this
talk
he
made
me
like
him
and
did
it
without
trouble
this
was
partly
through
his
winning
and
gentle
ways
but
mainly
through
the
amazing
familiarity
with
my
books
which
his
conversation
showed
he
was
down
to
date
with
them
too
and
if
he
had
made
them
the
study
of
his
life
he
could
hardly
have
been
better
posted
as
to
their
contents
than
he
was
he
made
me
better
satisfied
with
myself
than
i
had
ever
been
before
it
was
plain
that
he
had
a
deep
fondness
for
humor
yet
he
never
laughed
he
never
even
chuckled
in
fact
humor
could
not
win
to
outward
expression
on
his
face
at
all
no
he
was
always
grave
tenderly
pensively
grave
but
he
made
me
laugh
all
along
and
this
was
very
trying
and
very
pleasant
at
the
same
time
for
it
was
at
quotations
from
my
own
books
when
he
was
going
he
turned
and
said
you
do
remember
me
i
why
no
have
we
met
before
no
it
was
a
matter
of
correspondence
correspondence
yes
many
years
ago
twelve
or
fifteen
oh
longer
than
that
but
of
course
you
a
musing
pause
then
he
said
do
you
remember
corrigan
castle
i
believe
i
do
i
do
seem
to
recall
the
name
he
waited
a
moment
pondering
with
the
in
his
hand
then
started
out
but
turned
back
and
said
that
i
had
once
been
interested
in
corrigan
castle
and
asked
me
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
his
quarters
in
the
evening
and
take
a
hot
scotch
and
talk
it
over
i
was
a
teetotaler
and
liked
relaxation
so
i
said
i
would
we
drove
from
the
together
about
ten
he
had
a
most
comfortably
and
tastefully
furnished
parlor
with
good
pictures
on
the
walls
indian
and
japanese
ornaments
on
the
mantel
and
here
and
there
and
books
mine
which
made
me
proud
the
light
was
brilliant
the
easy
chairs
were
the
arrangements
for
brewing
and
smoking
were
all
there
we
brewed
and
lit
up
then
he
passed
a
sheet
of
to
me
and
said
do
you
remember
that
oh
yes
indeed
the
paper
was
of
a
sumptuous
quality
at
the
top
was
a
twisted
and
interlaced
monogram
printed
from
steel
dies
in
gold
and
blue
and
red
in
the
ornate
english
fashion
of
long
years
ago
and
under
it
in
neat
gothic
capitals
was
this
printed
in
blue
the
mark
twain
club
corrigan
castle
my
said
i
how
did
you
come
by
this
i
was
president
of
it
no
you
do
mean
it
it
is
true
i
was
its
first
president
i
was
annually
as
long
as
its
meetings
were
held
in
my
castle
corrigan
which
was
five
years
then
he
showed
me
an
album
with
photographs
of
me
in
it
five
of
them
were
of
old
dates
the
others
of
various
later
crops
the
list
closed
with
a
picture
taken
by
falk
in
sydney
a
month
before
you
sent
us
the
first
five
the
rest
were
bought
this
was
paradise
we
ran
late
and
talked
talked
talked
subject
the
mark
twain
club
of
corrigan
castle
ireland
my
first
knowledge
of
that
club
dates
away
back
all
of
twenty
years
i
should
say
it
came
to
me
in
the
form
of
a
courteous
letter
written
on
the
which
i
have
described
and
signed
by
order
of
the
president
pembroke
secretary
it
conveyed
the
fact
that
the
club
had
been
created
in
my
honor
and
added
the
hope
that
this
token
of
appreciation
of
my
work
would
meet
with
my
approval
i
answered
with
thanks
and
did
what
i
could
to
keep
my
gratification
from
it
was
then
that
the
long
correspondence
began
a
letter
came
back
by
order
of
the
president
furnishing
me
the
names
of
the
in
number
with
it
came
a
copy
of
the
constitution
and
in
pamphlet
form
and
artistically
printed
the
initiation
fee
and
dues
were
in
their
proper
place
also
schedule
of
meetings
monthly
for
essays
upon
works
of
mine
followed
by
discussions
quarterly
for
business
and
a
supper
without
essays
but
with
speeches
also
there
was
a
list
of
the
officers
president
secretary
treasurer
etc
the
letter
was
brief
but
it
was
pleasant
reading
for
it
told
me
about
the
strong
interest
which
the
membership
took
in
their
new
venture
etc
it
also
asked
me
for
a
photograph
a
special
one
i
went
down
and
sat
for
it
and
sent
it
with
a
letter
of
course
presently
came
the
badge
of
the
club
and
very
dainty
and
pretty
it
was
and
very
artistic
it
was
a
frog
peeping
out
from
a
graceful
tangle
of
and
rushes
and
was
done
in
enamels
on
a
gold
basis
and
had
a
gold
pin
back
of
it
after
i
had
petted
it
and
played
with
it
and
caressed
it
and
enjoyed
it
a
couple
of
hours
the
light
happened
to
fall
upon
it
at
a
new
angle
and
revealed
to
me
a
cunning
new
detail
with
the
light
just
right
certain
delicate
shadings
of
the
and
wove
themselves
into
a
monogram
mine
you
can
see
that
that
jewel
was
a
work
of
art
and
when
you
come
to
consider
the
intrinsic
value
of
it
you
must
concede
that
it
is
not
every
literary
club
that
could
afford
a
badge
like
that
it
was
easily
worth
in
the
opinion
of
marcus
and
ward
of
new
york
they
said
they
could
not
duplicate
it
for
that
and
make
a
profit
by
this
time
the
club
was
well
under
way
and
from
that
time
forth
its
secretary
kept
my
well
supplied
with
business
he
reported
the
club
discussions
of
my
books
with
laborious
fullness
and
did
his
work
with
great
spirit
and
ability
as
a
rule
he
synopsized
but
when
a
speech
was
especially
brilliant
he
it
and
gave
me
the
best
passages
from
it
written
out
there
were
five
speakers
whom
he
particularly
favored
in
that
way
palmer
forbes
naylor
norris
and
calder
palmer
and
forbes
could
never
get
through
a
speech
without
attacking
each
other
and
each
in
his
own
way
was
formidably
effective
palmer
in
virile
and
eloquent
abuse
forbes
in
courtly
and
elegant
but
scalding
satire
i
could
always
tell
which
of
them
was
talking
without
looking
for
his
name
naylor
had
a
polished
style
and
a
happy
knack
at
felicitous
metaphor
norris
style
was
wholly
without
ornament
but
enviably
compact
lucid
and
strong
but
after
all
calder
was
the
gem
he
never
spoke
when
sober
he
spoke
continuously
when
he
was
and
certainly
they
were
the
drunkest
speeches
that
a
man
ever
uttered
they
were
full
of
good
things
but
so
incredibly
mixed
up
and
wandering
that
it
made
one
head
swim
to
follow
him
they
were
not
intended
to
be
funny
but
they
were
funny
for
the
very
gravity
which
the
speaker
put
into
his
flowing
miracles
of
incongruity
in
the
course
of
five
years
i
came
to
know
the
styles
of
the
five
orators
as
well
as
i
knew
the
style
of
any
speaker
in
my
own
club
at
home
these
reports
came
every
month
they
were
written
on
foolscap
words
to
the
page
and
usually
about
pages
in
a
report
a
good
words
i
should
say
a
solid
week
work
the
reports
were
absorbingly
entertaining
long
as
they
were
but
unfortunately
for
me
they
did
not
come
alone
they
were
always
accompanied
by
a
lot
of
questions
about
passages
and
purposes
in
my
books
which
the
club
wanted
answered
and
additionally
accompanied
every
quarter
by
the
report
and
the
auditor
report
and
the
committee
report
and
the
president
review
and
my
opinion
of
these
was
always
desired
also
suggestions
for
the
good
of
the
club
if
any
occurred
to
me
by
and
by
i
came
to
dread
those
things
and
this
dread
grew
and
grew
and
grew
grew
until
i
got
to
anticipating
them
with
a
cold
horror
for
i
was
an
indolent
man
and
not
fond
of
and
whenever
these
things
came
i
had
to
put
everything
by
and
sit
down
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
and
dig
and
dig
until
i
got
something
out
of
my
head
which
would
answer
for
a
reply
i
got
along
fairly
well
the
first
year
but
for
the
succeeding
four
years
the
mark
twain
club
of
corrigan
castle
was
my
curse
my
nightmare
the
grief
and
misery
of
my
life
and
i
got
so
so
sick
of
sitting
for
photographs
i
sat
every
year
for
five
years
trying
to
satisfy
that
insatiable
organization
then
at
last
i
rose
in
revolt
i
could
endure
my
oppressions
no
longer
i
pulled
my
fortitude
together
and
tore
off
my
chains
and
was
a
free
man
again
and
happy
from
that
day
i
burned
the
secretary
fat
envelopes
the
moment
they
arrived
and
by
and
by
they
ceased
to
come
well
in
the
sociable
frankness
of
that
night
in
bendigo
i
brought
this
all
out
in
full
confession
then
blank
came
out
in
the
same
frank
way
and
with
a
preliminary
word
of
gentle
apology
said
that
he
was
the
mark
twain
club
and
the
only
member
it
had
ever
had
why
it
was
matter
for
anger
but
i
did
feel
any
he
said
he
never
had
to
work
for
a
living
and
that
by
the
time
he
was
thirty
life
had
become
a
bore
and
a
weariness
to
him
he
had
no
interests
left
they
had
paled
and
perished
one
by
one
and
left
him
desolate
he
had
begun
to
think
of
suicide
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
thought
of
that
happy
idea
of
starting
an
imaginary
club
and
went
straightway
to
work
at
it
with
enthusiasm
and
love
he
was
charmed
with
it
it
gave
him
something
to
do
it
elaborated
itself
on
his
hands
it
became
twenty
times
more
complex
and
formidable
than
was
his
first
rude
draft
of
it
every
new
addition
to
his
original
plan
which
cropped
up
in
his
mind
gave
him
a
fresh
interest
and
a
new
pleasure
he
designed
the
club
badge
himself
and
worked
over
it
altering
and
improving
it
a
number
of
days
and
nights
then
sent
to
london
and
had
it
made
it
was
the
only
one
that
was
made
it
was
made
for
me
the
rest
of
the
club
went
without
he
invented
the
members
and
their
names
he
invented
the
five
favorite
speakers
and
their
five
separate
styles
he
invented
their
speeches
and
reported
them
himself
he
would
have
kept
that
club
going
until
now
if
i
had
deserted
he
said
he
said
he
worked
like
a
slave
over
those
reports
each
of
them
cost
him
from
a
week
to
a
work
and
the
work
gave
him
pleasure
and
kept
him
alive
and
willing
to
be
alive
it
was
a
bitter
blow
to
him
when
the
club
died
finally
there
was
any
corrigan
castle
he
had
invented
that
too
it
was
wonderful
the
whole
thing
and
altogether
the
most
ingenious
and
laborious
and
cheerful
and
painstaking
practical
joke
i
have
ever
heard
of
and
i
liked
it
liked
to
bear
him
tell
about
it
yet
i
have
been
a
hater
of
practical
jokes
from
as
long
back
as
i
can
remember
finally
he
said
do
you
remember
a
note
from
melbourne
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
telling
about
your
lecture
tour
in
australia
and
your
death
and
burial
in
melbourne
a
note
from
henry
bascomb
of
bascomb
hall
upper
holywell
hants
yes
i
wrote
it
yes
i
did
it
i
do
know
why
i
just
took
the
notion
and
carried
it
out
without
stopping
to
think
it
was
wrong
it
could
have
done
harm
i
was
always
sorry
about
it
afterward
you
must
forgive
me
i
was
bascom
guest
on
his
yacht
on
his
voyage
around
the
world
he
often
spoke
of
you
and
of
the
pleasant
times
you
had
had
together
in
his
home
and
the
notion
took
me
there
in
melbourne
and
i
imitated
his
hand
and
wrote
the
letter
so
the
mystery
was
cleared
up
after
so
many
many
years
chapter
xxvi
there
are
people
who
can
do
all
fine
and
heroic
things
but
one
keep
from
telling
their
happinesses
to
the
unhappy
wilson
new
calendar
after
visits
to
maryborough
and
some
other
australian
towns
we
presently
took
passage
for
new
zealand
if
it
would
not
look
too
much
like
showing
off
i
would
tell
the
reader
where
new
zealand
is
for
he
is
as
i
was
he
thinks
he
knows
and
he
thinks
he
knows
where
hertzegovina
is
and
how
to
pronounce
pariah
and
how
to
use
the
word
unique
without
exposing
himself
to
the
derision
of
the
dictionary
but
in
truth
he
knows
none
of
these
things
there
are
but
four
or
five
people
in
the
world
who
possess
this
knowledge
and
these
make
their
living
out
of
it
they
travel
from
place
to
place
visiting
literary
assemblages
geographical
societies
and
seats
of
learning
and
springing
sudden
bets
that
these
people
do
not
know
these
things
since
all
people
think
they
know
them
they
are
an
easy
prey
to
these
adventurers
or
rather
they
were
an
easy
prey
until
the
law
interfered
three
months
ago
and
a
new
york
court
decided
that
this
kind
of
gambling
is
illegal
because
it
traverses
article
iv
section
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
forbids
betting
on
a
sure
thing
this
decision
was
rendered
by
the
full
bench
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
after
a
test
sprung
upon
the
court
by
counsel
for
the
prosecution
which
showed
that
none
of
the
nine
judges
was
able
to
answer
any
of
the
four
questions
all
people
think
that
new
zealand
is
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
that
you
cross
to
it
on
a
bridge
but
that
is
not
so
it
is
not
close
to
anything
but
lies
by
itself
out
in
the
water
it
is
nearest
to
australia
but
still
not
near
the
gap
between
is
very
wide
it
will
be
a
surprise
to
the
reader
as
it
was
to
me
to
learn
that
the
distance
from
australia
to
new
zealand
is
really
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
miles
and
that
there
is
no
bridge
i
learned
this
from
professor
of
yale
university
whom
i
met
in
the
steamer
on
the
great
lakes
when
i
was
crossing
the
continent
to
sail
across
the
pacific
i
asked
him
about
new
zealand
in
order
to
make
conversation
i
supposed
he
would
generalize
a
little
without
compromising
himself
and
then
turn
the
subject
to
something
he
was
acquainted
with
and
my
object
would
then
be
attained
the
ice
would
be
broken
and
we
could
go
smoothly
on
and
get
acquainted
and
have
a
pleasant
time
but
to
my
surprise
he
was
not
only
not
embarrassed
by
my
question
but
seemed
to
welcome
it
and
to
take
a
distinct
interest
in
it
he
began
to
talk
fluently
confidently
comfortably
and
as
he
talked
my
admiration
grew
and
grew
for
as
the
subject
developed
under
his
hands
i
saw
that
he
not
only
knew
where
new
zealand
was
but
that
he
was
minutely
familiar
with
every
detail
of
its
history
politics
religions
and
commerce
its
fauna
flora
geology
products
and
climatic
peculiarities
when
he
was
done
i
was
lost
in
wonder
and
admiration
and
said
to
myself
he
knows
everything
in
the
domain
of
human
knowledge
he
is
king
i
wanted
to
see
him
do
more
miracles
and
so
just
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
him
answer
i
asked
him
about
hertzegovina
and
pariah
and
unique
but
he
began
to
generalize
then
and
show
distress
i
saw
that
with
new
zealand
gone
he
was
a
samson
shorn
of
his
locks
he
was
as
other
men
this
was
a
curious
and
interesting
mystery
and
i
was
frank
with
him
and
asked
him
to
explain
it
he
tried
to
avoid
it
at
first
but
then
laughed
and
said
that
after
all
the
matter
was
not
worth
concealment
so
he
would
let
me
into
the
secret
in
substance
this
is
his
story
last
autumn
i
was
at
work
one
morning
at
home
when
a
card
came
up
the
card
of
a
stranger
under
the
name
was
printed
a
line
which
showed
that
this
visitor
was
professor
of
theological
engineering
in
wellington
university
new
zealand
i
was
troubled
troubled
i
mean
by
the
shortness
of
the
notice
college
etiquette
required
that
he
be
at
once
invited
to
dinner
by
some
member
of
the
faculty
invited
to
dine
on
that
day
not
put
off
till
a
subsequent
day
i
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
college
etiquette
requires
in
the
case
of
a
foreign
guest
that
the
shall
begin
with
complimentary
references
to
his
country
its
great
men
its
services
to
civilization
its
seats
of
learning
and
things
like
that
and
of
course
the
host
is
responsible
and
must
either
begin
this
talk
himself
or
see
that
it
is
done
by
some
one
else
i
was
in
great
difficulty
and
the
more
i
searched
my
memory
the
more
my
trouble
grew
i
found
that
i
knew
nothing
about
new
zealand
i
thought
i
knew
where
it
was
and
that
was
all
i
had
an
impression
that
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
that
one
went
over
to
it
on
a
bridge
this
might
turn
out
to
be
incorrect
and
even
if
correct
it
would
not
furnish
matter
enough
for
the
purpose
at
the
dinner
and
i
should
expose
my
college
to
shame
before
my
guest
he
would
see
that
i
a
member
of
the
faculty
of
the
first
university
in
america
was
wholly
ignorant
of
his
country
and
he
would
go
away
and
tell
this
and
laugh
at
it
the
thought
of
it
made
my
face
burn
i
sent
for
my
wife
and
told
her
how
i
was
situated
and
asked
for
her
help
and
she
thought
of
a
thing
which
i
might
have
thought
of
myself
if
i
had
not
been
excited
and
worried
she
said
she
would
go
and
tell
the
visitor
that
i
was
out
but
would
be
in
in
a
few
minutes
and
she
would
talk
and
keep
him
busy
while
i
got
out
the
back
way
and
hurried
over
and
make
professor
lawson
give
the
dinner
for
lawson
knew
everything
and
could
meet
the
guest
in
a
creditable
way
and
save
the
reputation
of
the
university
i
ran
to
lawson
but
was
disappointed
he
did
not
know
anything
about
new
zealand
he
said
that
as
far
as
his
recollection
went
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
you
go
over
to
it
on
a
bridge
but
that
was
all
he
knew
it
was
too
bad
lawson
was
a
perfect
encyclopedia
of
abstruse
learning
but
now
in
this
hour
of
our
need
it
turned
out
that
he
did
not
know
any
useful
thing
we
consulted
he
saw
that
the
reputation
of
the
university
was
in
very
real
peril
and
he
walked
the
floor
in
anxiety
talking
and
trying
to
think
out
some
way
to
meet
the
difficulty
presently
he
decided
that
we
must
try
the
rest
of
the
faculty
some
of
them
might
know
about
new
zealand
so
we
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
the
professor
of
astronomy
and
asked
him
and
he
said
that
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
close
to
australia
or
asia
or
somewhere
and
you
went
over
to
it
on
we
shut
him
off
and
called
up
the
professor
of
biology
and
he
said
that
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
close
to
aus
we
shut
him
off
and
sat
down
worried
and
disheartened
to
see
if
we
could
think
up
some
other
scheme
we
shortly
hit
upon
one
which
promised
well
and
this
one
we
adopted
and
set
its
machinery
going
at
once
it
was
this
lawson
must
give
the
dinner
the
faculty
must
be
notified
by
telephone
to
prepare
we
must
all
get
to
work
diligently
and
at
the
end
of
eight
hours
and
a
half
we
must
come
to
dinner
acquainted
with
new
zealand
at
least
well
enough
informed
to
appear
without
discredit
before
this
native
to
seem
properly
intelligent
we
should
have
to
know
about
new
zealand
population
and
politics
and
form
of
government
and
commerce
and
taxes
and
products
and
ancient
history
and
modern
history
and
varieties
of
religion
and
nature
of
the
laws
and
their
codification
and
amount
of
revenue
and
whence
drawn
and
methods
of
collection
and
percentage
of
loss
and
character
of
climate
and
well
a
lot
of
things
like
that
we
must
suck
the
maps
and
cyclopedias
dry
and
while
we
posted
up
in
this
way
the
faculty
wives
must
flock
over
one
after
the
other
in
a
studiedly
casual
way
and
help
my
wife
keep
the
new
zealander
quiet
and
not
let
him
get
out
and
come
interfering
with
our
studies
the
scheme
worked
admirably
but
it
stopped
business
stopped
it
entirely
it
is
in
the
official
of
yale
to
be
read
and
wondered
at
by
future
generations
the
account
of
the
great
blank
day
the
memorable
blank
day
the
day
wherein
the
wheels
of
culture
were
stopped
a
sunday
silence
prevailed
all
about
and
the
whole
university
stood
still
while
the
faculty
and
qualified
itself
to
sit
at
meat
without
shame
in
the
presence
of
the
professor
of
theological
engineering
from
new
zealand
when
we
assembled
at
the
dinner
we
were
miserably
tired
and
worn
but
we
were
posted
yes
it
is
fair
to
claim
that
in
fact
erudition
is
a
pale
name
for
it
new
zealand
was
the
only
subject
and
it
was
just
beautiful
to
hear
us
ripple
it
out
and
with
such
an
air
of
unembarrassed
ease
and
unostentatious
familiarity
with
detail
and
trained
and
seasoned
mastery
of
the
oh
the
grace
and
fluency
of
it
well
finally
somebody
happened
to
notice
that
the
guest
was
looking
dazed
and
was
saying
anything
so
they
stirred
him
up
of
course
then
that
man
came
out
with
a
good
honest
eloquent
compliment
that
made
the
faculty
blush
he
said
he
was
not
worthy
to
sit
in
the
company
of
men
like
these
that
he
had
been
silent
from
admiration
that
he
had
been
silent
from
another
cause
also
silent
from
shame
silent
from
ignorance
said
he
who
have
lived
eighteen
years
in
new
zealand
and
have
served
five
in
a
professorship
and
ought
to
know
much
about
that
country
perceive
now
that
i
know
almost
nothing
about
it
i
say
it
with
shame
that
i
have
learned
fifty
times
yes
a
hundred
times
more
about
new
zealand
in
these
two
hours
at
this
table
than
i
ever
knew
before
in
all
the
eighteen
years
put
together
i
was
silent
because
i
could
not
help
myself
what
i
knew
about
taxes
and
policies
and
laws
and
revenue
and
products
and
history
and
all
that
multitude
of
things
was
but
general
and
ordinary
and
in
a
word
and
it
would
have
been
insanity
to
expose
it
here
to
the
searching
glare
of
your
amazingly
accurate
and
knowledge
of
those
matters
gentlemen
i
beg
you
to
let
me
sit
silent
as
becomes
me
but
do
not
change
the
subject
i
can
at
least
follow
you
in
this
one
whereas
if
you
change
to
one
which
shall
call
out
the
full
strength
of
your
mighty
erudition
i
shall
be
as
one
lost
if
you
know
all
this
about
a
remote
little
inconsequent
patch
like
new
zealand
ah
what
would
you
know
about
any
other
subject

a

warm
in

in

an
icy

blowing
out
of

a

long

it

with
nothing
in
the

to
obstruct

and
tone

down
i
have
read
somewhere
that
an
acute
observer
among
the

cook
or

accepted
this
majestic

as
trustworthy
circumstantial
evidence
that
no

so

not

afternoon
passing
between
tasmania
formerly
van
diemen
land
and
neighboring
islands
islands
whence
the
poor
exiled
tasmanian
savages
used
to
gaze
at
their
lost
homeland
and
cry
and
die
of
broken
hearts
how
glad
i
am
that
all
these
native
races
are
dead
and
gone
or
nearly
so
the
work
was
mercifully
swift
and
horrible
in
some
portions
of
australia
as
far
as
tasmania
is
concerned
the
extermination
was
complete
not
a
native
is
left
it
was
a
strife
of
years
and
decades
of
years
the
whites
and
the
blacks
hunted
each
other
ambushed
each
other
butchered
each
other
the
blacks
were
not
numerous
but
they
were
wary
alert
cunning
and
they
knew
their
country
well
they
lasted
a
long
time
few
as
they
were
and
inflicted
much
slaughter
upon
the
whites
the
government
wanted
to
save
the
blacks
from
ultimate
extermination
if
possible
one
of
its
schemes
was
to
capture
them
and
coop
them
up
on
a
neighboring
island
under
guard
bodies
of
whites
volunteered
for
the
hunt
for
the
pay
was
good
for
each
black
captured
and
delivered
but
the
success
achieved
was
not
very
satisfactory
the
black
was
naked
and
his
body
was
greased
it
was
hard
to
get
a
grip
on
him
that
would
hold
the
whites
moved
about
in
armed
bodies
and
surprised
little
families
of
natives
and
did
make
captures
but
it
was
suspected
that
in
these
surprises
half
a
dozen
natives
were
killed
to
one
caught
and
that
was
not
what
the
government
desired
another
scheme
was
to
drive
the
natives
into
a
corner
of
the
island
and
fence
them
in
by
a
cordon
of
men
placed
in
line
across
the
country
but
the
natives
managed
to
slip
through
constantly
and
continue
their
murders
and
arsons
the
governor
warned
these
unlettered
savages
by
printed
proclamation
that
they
must
stay
in
the
desolate
region
officially
appointed
for
them
the
proclamation
was
a
dead
letter
the
savages
could
not
read
it
afterward
a
was
issued
it
was
painted
up
on
boards
and
these
were
nailed
to
trees
in
the
forest
herewith
is
a
photographic
reproduction
of
this
substantially
it
means
the
governor
wishes
the
whites
and
the
blacks
to
love
each
other
he
loves
his
black
subjects
blacks
who
kill
whites
will
be
hanged
whites
who
kill
blacks
will
be
hanged
upon
its
several
schemes
the
government
spent
and
employed
the
labors
and
ingenuities
of
several
thousand
whites
for
a
long
time
with
failure
as
a
result
then
at
last
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
the
beginning
of
the
troubles
between
the
two
races
the
right
man
was
found
no
he
found
himself
this
was
george
augustus
robinson
called
in
history
the
conciliator
he
was
not
educated
and
not
conspicuous
in
any
way
he
was
a
working
bricklayer
in
hobart
town
but
he
must
have
been
an
amazing
personality
a
man
worth
traveling
far
to
see
it
may
be
his
counterpart
appears
in
history
but
i
do
not
know
where
to
look
for
it
he
set
himself
this
incredible
task
to
go
out
into
the
wilderness
the
jungle
and
the
where
the
hunted
and
implacable
savages
were
hidden
and
appear
among
them
unarmed
speak
the
language
of
love
and
of
kindness
to
them
and
persuade
them
to
forsake
their
homes
and
the
wild
free
life
that
was
so
dear
to
them
and
go
with
him
and
surrender
to
the
hated
whites
and
live
under
their
watch
and
ward
and
upon
their
charity
the
rest
of
their
lives
on
its
face
it
was
the
dream
of
a
madman
in
the
beginning
his
project
was
sarcastically
dubbed
the
sugar
plum
speculation
if
the
scheme
was
striking
and
new
to
the
world
experience
the
situation
was
not
less
so
it
was
this
the
white
population
numbered
in
the
black
population
numbered
three
hundred
not
warriors
but
men
women
and
children
the
whites
were
armed
with
guns
the
blacks
with
clubs
and
spears
the
whites
had
fought
the
blacks
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
had
tried
every
thinkable
way
to
capture
kill
or
subdue
them
and
could
not
do
it
if
white
men
of
any
race
could
have
done
it
these
would
have
accomplished
it
but
every
scheme
had
failed
the
splendid
the
matchless
were
unconquered
and
manifestly
unconquerable
they
would
not
yield
they
would
listen
to
no
terms
they
would
fight
to
the
bitter
end
yet
they
had
no
poet
to
keep
up
their
heart
and
sing
the
marvel
of
their
magnificent
patriotism
at
the
end
of
years
of
hard
fighting
the
surviving
naked
patriots
were
still
defiant
still
persistent
still
efficacious
with
their
rude
weapons
and
the
governor
and
the
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
nor
what
to
do
then
the
bricklayer
that
wonderful
man
proposed
to
go
out
into
the
wilderness
with
no
weapon
but
his
tongue
and
no
protection
but
his
honest
eye
and
his
humane
heart
and
track
those
embittered
savages
to
their
lairs
in
the
gloomy
forests
and
among
the
mountain
snows
naturally
he
was
considered
a
crank
but
he
was
not
quite
that
in
fact
he
was
a
good
way
short
of
that
he
was
building
upon
his
long
and
intimate
knowledge
of
the
native
character
the
deriders
of
his
project
were
right
from
their
standpoint
for
they
believed
the
natives
to
be
mere
wild
beasts
and
robinson
was
right
from
his
standpoint
for
he
believed
the
natives
to
be
human
beings
the
truth
did
really
lie
between
the
two
the
event
proved
that
robinson
judgment
was
soundest
but
about
once
a
month
for
four
years
the
event
came
near
to
giving
the
verdict
to
the
deriders
for
about
that
frequently
robinson
barely
escaped
falling
under
the
native
spears
but
history
shows
that
he
had
a
thinking
head
and
was
not
a
mere
wild
sentimentalist
for
instance
he
wanted
the
war
parties
called
in
before
he
started
unarmed
upon
his
mission
of
peace
he
wanted
the
best
chance
of
success
not
a
and
he
was
very
willing
to
have
help
and
so
high
rewards
were
advertised
for
any
who
would
go
unarmed
with
him
this
opportunity
was
declined
robinson
persuaded
some
tamed
natives
of
both
sexes
to
go
with
him
a
strong
evidence
of
his
persuasive
powers
for
those
natives
well
knew
that
their
destruction
would
be
almost
certain
as
it
turned
out
they
had
to
face
death
over
and
over
again
robinson
and
his
little
party
had
a
difficult
undertaking
upon
their
hands
they
could
not
ride
off
horseback
comfortably
into
the
woods
and
call
leonidas
and
his
together
for
a
talk
and
a
treaty
the
following
day
for
the
wild
men
were
not
in
a
body
they
were
scattered
immense
distances
apart
over
regions
so
desolate
that
even
the
birds
could
not
make
a
living
with
the
chances
offered
scattered
in
groups
of
twenty
a
dozen
half
a
dozen
even
in
groups
of
three
and
the
mission
must
go
on
foot
bonwick
furnishes
a
description
of
those
horrible
regions
whereby
it
will
be
seen
that
even
fugitive
gangs
of
the
hardiest
and
choicest
human
devils
the
world
has
seen
the
convicts
set
apart
to
people
the
hell
of
macquarrie
harbor
station
were
never
able
but
once
to
survive
the
horrors
of
a
march
through
them
but
starving
and
struggling
and
fainting
and
failing
ate
each
other
and
died
onward
still
onward
was
the
order
of
the
indomitable
robinson
no
one
ignorant
of
the
western
country
of
tasmania
can
form
a
correct
idea
of
the
traveling
difficulties
while
i
was
resident
in
hobart
town
the
governor
sir
john
franklin
and
his
lady
undertook
the
western
journey
to
macquarrie
harbor
and
suffered
terribly
one
man
who
assisted
to
carry
her
ladyship
through
the
swamps
gave
me
his
bitter
experience
of
its
miseries
several
were
disabled
for
life
no
wonder
that
but
one
party
escaping
from
macquarrie
harbor
convict
settlement
arrived
at
the
civilized
region
in
safety
men
perished
in
the
scrub
were
lost
in
snow
or
were
devoured
by
their
companions
this
was
the
territory
traversed
by
robinson
and
his
black
guides
all
honor
to
his
intrepidity
and
their
wonderful
fidelity
when
they
had
in
the
depth
of
winter
to
cross
deep
and
rapid
rivers
pass
among
mountains
six
thousand
feet
high
pierce
dangerous
thickets
and
find
food
in
a
country
forsaken
even
by
birds
we
can
realize
their
hardships
after
a
frightful
journey
by
cradle
mountain
and
over
the
lofty
plateau
of
middlesex
plains
the
travelers
experienced
unwonted
misery
and
the
circumstances
called
forth
the
best
qualities
of
the
noble
little
band
robinson
wrote
afterwards
to
secretary
burnett
some
details
of
this
passage
of
horrors
in
that
letter
of
oct
he
states
that
his
natives
were
very
reluctant
to
go
over
the
dreadful
mountain
passes
that
seven
successive
days
we
continued
traveling
over
one
solid
body
of
snow
that
snows
were
of
incredible
depth
that
natives
were
frequently
up
to
their
middle
in
snow
but
still
the
diseased
and
men
and
women
were
sustained
by
the
cheerful
voice
of
their
unconquerable
friend
and
responded
most
nobly
to
his
call
bonwick
says
that
robinson
friendly
capture
of
the
big
river
tribe
remember
it
was
a
whole
tribe
was
by
far
the
grandest
feature
of
the
war
and
the
crowning
glory
of
his
efforts
the
word
war
was
not
well
chosen
and
is
misleading
there
was
war
still
but
only
the
blacks
were
conducting
it
the
whites
were
holding
off
until
robinson
could
give
his
scheme
a
fair
trial
i
think
that
we
are
to
understand
that
the
friendly
capture
of
that
tribe
was
by
far
the
most
important
thing
the
highest
in
value
that
happened
during
the
whole
thirty
years
of
truceless
hostilities
that
it
was
a
decisive
thing
a
peaceful
waterloo
the
surrender
of
the
native
napoleon
and
his
dreaded
forces
the
happy
ending
of
the
long
strife
for
that
tribe
was
the
terror
of
the
colony
its
chief
the
black
douglas
of
bush
households
robinson
knew
that
these
formidable
people
were
lurking
somewhere
in
some
remote
corner
of
the
hideous
regions
just
described
and
he
and
his
unarmed
little
party
started
on
a
tedious
and
perilous
hunt
for
them
at
last
there
under
the
shadows
of
the
frenchman
cap
whose
grim
cone
rose
five
thousand
feet
in
the
uninhabited
westward
interior
they
were
found
it
was
a
serious
moment
robinson
himself
believed
for
once
that
his
mission
successful
until
now
was
to
end
here
in
failure
and
that
his
own
had
struck
the
redoubtable
chief
stood
in
menacing
attitude
with
his
spear
poised
his
warriors
stood
massed
at
his
back
armed
for
battle
their
faces
eloquent
with
their
loathing
for
white
men
they
rattled
their
spears
and
shouted
their
their
women
were
back
of
them
laden
with
supplies
of
weapons
and
keeping
their
eager
dogs
quiet
until
the
chief
should
give
the
signal
to
fall
on
i
think
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
resurrection
whispered
a
member
of
robinson
little
party
i
think
we
shall
answered
robinson
then
plucked
up
heart
and
began
his
persuasions
in
the
tribe
own
dialect
which
surprised
and
pleased
the
chief
presently
there
was
an
interruption
by
the
chief
who
are
you
we
are
gentlemen
where
are
your
guns
we
have
none
the
warrior
was
astonished
where
your
little
guns
pistols
we
have
none
a
few
minutes
passed
in
suspense
discussion
among
the
tribesmen
robinson
tamed
squaws
ventured
to
cross
the
line
and
begin
persuasions
upon
the
wild
squaws
then
the
chief
stepped
back
to
confer
with
the
old
women
the
real
arbiters
of
savage
war
bonwick
continues
as
the
fallen
gladiator
in
the
arena
looks
for
the
signal
of
life
or
death
from
the
president
of
the
amphitheatre
so
waited
our
friends
in
anxious
suspense
while
the
conference
continued
in
a
few
minutes
before
a
word
was
uttered
the
women
of
the
tribe
threw
up
their
arms
three
times
this
was
the
inviolable
sign
of
peace
down
fell
the
spears
forward
with
a
heavy
sigh
of
relief
and
upward
glance
of
gratitude
came
the
friends
of
peace
the
impulsive
natives
rushed
forth
with
tears
and
cries
as
each
saw
in
the
other
rank
a
loved
one
of
the
past
it
was
a
jubilee
of
joy
a
festival
followed
and
while
tears
flowed
at
the
recital
of
woe
a
corrobory
of
pleasant
laughter
closed
the
eventful
day
in
four
years
without
the
spilling
of
a
drop
of
blood
robinson
brought
them
all
in
willing
captives
and
delivered
them
to
the
white
governor
and
ended
the
war
which
powder
and
bullets
and
thousands
of
men
to
use
them
had
prosecuted
without
result
since
marsyas
charming
the
wild
beasts
with
his
music
that
is
fable
but
the
miracle
wrought
by
robinson
is
fact
it
is
history
and
authentic
and
surely
there
is
nothing
greater
nothing
more
in
the
history
of
any
country
ancient
or
modern
and
in
memory
of
the
greatest
man
australasia
ever
developed
or
ever
will
develop
there
is
a
stately
monument
to
george
augustus
robinson
the
conciliator
in
no
it
is
to
another
man
i
forget
his
name
however
robertson
own
generation
honored
him
and
in
manifesting
it
honored
themselves
the
government
gave
him
a
and
a
thousand
acres
of
land
and
the
people
held
and
praised
him
and
emphasized
their
praise
with
a
large
subscription
of
money
a
good
dramatic
situation
but
the
curtain
fell
on
another
when
this
desperate
tribe
was
thus
captured
there
was
much
surprise
to
find
that
the
of
a
little
earlier
day
had
been
spent
and
the
whole
population
of
the
colony
placed
under
arms
in
contention
with
an
opposing
force
of
sixteen
men
with
wooden
spears
yet
such
was
the
fact
the
celebrated
big
river
tribe
that
had
been
raised
by
european
fears
to
a
host
consisted
of
sixteen
men
nine
women
and
one
child
with
a
knowledge
of
the
mischief
done
by
these
few
their
wonderful
marches
and
their
widespread
aggressions
their
enemies
can
not
deny
to
them
the
attributes
of
courage
and
military
tact
a
wallace
might
harass
a
large
army
with
a
small
and
determined
band
but
the
contending
parties
were
at
least
equal
in
arms
and
civilization
the
zulus
who
fought
us
in
africa
the
maories
in
new
zealand
the
arabs
in
the
soudan
were
far
better
provided
with
weapons
more
advanced
in
the
science
of
war
and
considerably
more
numerous
than
the
naked
tasmanians
governor
arthur
rightly
termed
them
a
noble
race
these
were
indeed
wonderful
people
the
natives
they
ought
not
to
have
been
wasted
they
should
have
been
crossed
with
the
whites
it
would
have
improved
the
whites
and
done
the
natives
no
harm
but
the
natives
were
wasted
poor
heroic
wild
creatures
they
were
gathered
together
in
little
settlements
on
neighboring
islands
and
paternally
cared
for
by
the
government
and
instructed
in
religion
and
deprived
of
tobacco
because
the
superintendent
of
the
was
not
a
smoker
and
so
considered
smoking
immoral
the
natives
were
not
used
to
clothes
and
houses
and
regular
hours
and
church
and
school
and
and
work
and
the
other
misplaced
persecutions
of
civilization
and
they
pined
for
their
lost
home
and
their
wild
free
life
too
late
they
repented
that
they
had
traded
that
heaven
for
this
hell
they
sat
homesick
on
their
alien
crags
and
day
by
day
gazed
out
through
their
tears
over
the
sea
with
unappeasable
longing
toward
the
hazy
bulk
which
was
the
specter
of
what
had
been
their
paradise
one
by
one
their
hearts
broke
and
they
died
in
a
very
few
years
nothing
but
a
scant
remnant
remained
alive
a
handful
lingered
along
into
age
in
the
last
man
died
in
the
last
woman
died
and
the
spartans
of
australasia
were
extinct
the
whites
always
mean
well
when
they
take
human
fish
out
of
the
ocean
and
try
to
make
them
dry
and
warm
and
happy
and
comfortable
in
a
chicken
coop
but
the
white
man
can
always
be
depended
on
to
prove
himself
inadequate
when
he
deals
with
savages
he
can
not
turn
the
situation
around
and
imagine
how
he
would
like
it
to
have
a
savage
transfer
him
from
his
house
and
his
church
and
his
clothes
and
his
books
and
his
choice
food
to
a
hideous
wilderness
of
sand
and
rocks
and
snow
and
ice
and
sleet
and
storm
and
blistering
sun
with
no
shelter
no
bed
no
covering
for
his
and
his
family
naked
bodies
and
nothing
to
eat
but
snakes
and
grubs
and
this
would
be
a
hell
to
him
and
if
he
had
any
wisdom
he
would
know
that
his
own
civilization
is
a
hell
to
the
savage
but
he
has
any
and
has
never
had
any
and
for
lack
of
it
he
shut
up
those
poor
natives
in
the
unimaginable
perdition
of
his
civilization
committing
his
crime
with
the
very
best
intentions
and
saw
those
poor
creatures
waste
away
under
his
tortures
and
gazed
at
it
vaguely
troubled
and
sorrowful
and
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
with
them
one
is
almost
betrayed
into
respecting
those
criminals
they
were
so
sincerely
kind
and
tender
and
humane
and
they
did
know
why
those
exiled
savages
faded
away
and
they
did
their
honest
best
to
reason
it
out
and
one
man
in
a
like
case
in
new
south
wales
did
reason
it
out
and
arrive
at
a
solution
it
is
from
the
wrath
of
god
which
is
revealed
from
heaven
against
cold
ungodliness
and
unrighteousness
of
men
that
settles
it

us

the
aphorism
does
really
seem
true
given
the
circumstances
the

will
appear
but
the
man
mus
appear
ahead

it

in

the
moment
had
been
approaching
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
meantime
the
future
conciliator
was
tranquilly
laying
bricks
in
hobart
when
all
other
means
had
failed
the
moment
had
arrived
and
the
bricklayer
put
down
his
trowel
and
came
forward
earlier
he
would
have
been
jeered
back
to
his
trowel
again
it
reminds
me
of
a
tale
that
was
told
me
by
a
kentuckian
on
the
train
when
we
were
crossing
montana
he
said
the
tale
was
current
in
louisville
years
ago
he
thought
it
had
been
in
print
but
could
not
remember
at
any
rate
in
substance
it
was
this
as
nearly
as
i
can
call
it
back
to
mind
a
few
years
before
the
outbreak
of
the
civil
war
it
began
to
appear
that
memphis
tennessee
was
going
to
be
a
great
tobacco
entrepot
the
wise
could
see
the
signs
of
it
at
that
time
memphis
had
a
wharf
boat
of
course
there
was
a
paved
sloping
wharf
for
the
accommodation
of
freight
but
the
steamers
landed
on
the
outside
of
the
wharfboat
and
all
loading
and
unloading
was
done
across
it
between
steamer
and
shore
a
number
of
wharfboat
clerks
were
needed
and
part
of
the
time
every
day
they
were
very
busy
and
part
of
the
time
tediously
idle
they
were
boiling
over
with
youth
and
spirits
and
they
had
to
make
the
intervals
of
idleness
endurable
in
some
way
and
as
a
rule
they
did
it
by
contriving
practical
jokes
and
playing
them
upon
each
other
the
favorite
butt
for
the
jokes
was
ed
jackson
because
he
played
none
himself
and
was
easy
game
for
other
people
for
he
always
believed
whatever
was
told
him
one
day
he
told
the
others
his
scheme
for
his
holiday
he
was
not
going
fishing
or
hunting
this
time
no
he
had
thought
out
a
better
plan
out
of
his
a
month
he
had
saved
enough
for
his
purpose
in
an
economical
way
and
he
was
going
to
have
a
look
at
new
york
it
was
a
great
and
surprising
idea
it
meant
travel
immense
travel
in
those
days
it
meant
seeing
the
world
it
was
the
equivalent
of
a
voyage
around
it
in
ours
at
first
the
other
youths
thought
his
mind
was
affected
but
when
they
found
that
he
was
in
earnest
the
next
thing
to
be
thought
of
was
what
sort
of
opportunity
this
venture
might
afford
for
a
practical
joke
the
young
men
studied
over
the
matter
then
held
a
secret
consultation
and
made
a
plan
the
idea
was
that
one
of
the
conspirators
should
offer
ed
a
letter
of
introduction
to
commodore
vanderbilt
and
trick
him
into
delivering
it
it
would
be
easy
to
do
this
but
what
would
ed
do
when
he
got
back
to
memphis
that
was
a
serious
matter
he
was
and
had
always
taken
the
jokes
patiently
but
they
had
been
jokes
which
did
not
humiliate
him
did
not
bring
him
to
shame
whereas
this
would
be
a
cruel
one
in
that
way
and
to
play
it
was
to
meddle
with
fire
for
with
all
his
good
nature
ed
was
a
southerner
and
the
english
of
that
was
that
when
he
came
back
he
would
kill
as
many
of
the
conspirators
as
he
could
before
falling
himself
however
the
chances
must
be
taken
it
would
do
to
waste
such
a
joke
as
that
so
the
letter
was
prepared
with
great
care
and
elaboration
it
was
signed
alfred
fairchild
and
was
written
in
an
easy
and
friendly
spirit
it
stated
that
the
bearer
was
the
bosom
friend
of
the
writer
son
and
was
of
good
parts
and
sterling
character
and
it
begged
the
commodore
to
be
kind
to
the
young
stranger
for
the
writer
sake
it
went
on
to
say
you
may
have
forgotten
me
in
this
long
stretch
of
time
but
you
will
easily
call
me
back
out
of
your
boyhood
memories
when
i
remind
you
of
how
we
robbed
old
stevenson
orchard
that
night
and
how
while
he
was
chasing
down
the
road
after
us
we
cut
across
the
field
and
doubled
back
and
sold
his
own
apples
to
his
own
cook
for
a
of
doughnuts
and
the
time
that
we
and
so
forth
and
so
on
bringing
in
names
of
imaginary
comrades
and
detailing
all
sorts
of
wild
and
absurd
and
of
course
wholly
imaginary
schoolboy
pranks
and
adventures
but
putting
them
into
lively
and
telling
shape
with
all
gravity
ed
was
asked
if
he
would
like
to
have
a
letter
to
commodore
vanderbilt
the
great
millionaire
it
was
expected
that
the
question
would
astonish
ed
and
it
did
what
do
you
know
that
extraordinary
man
no
but
my
father
does
they
were
schoolboys
together
and
if
you
like
i
write
and
ask
father
i
know
he
be
glad
to
give
it
to
you
for
my
sake
ed
could
not
find
words
capable
of
expressing
his
gratitude
and
delight
the
three
days
passed
and
the
letter
was
put
into
his
bands
he
started
on
his
trip
still
pouring
out
his
thanks
while
he
shook
all
around
and
when
he
was
out
of
sight
his
comrades
let
fly
their
laughter
in
a
storm
of
happy
satisfaction
and
then
quieted
down
and
were
less
happy
less
satisfied
for
the
old
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
of
this
deception
began
to
intrude
again
arrived
in
new
york
ed
found
his
way
to
commodore
vanderbilt
business
quarters
and
was
ushered
into
a
large
anteroom
where
a
score
of
people
were
patiently
awaiting
their
turn
for
a
interview
with
the
millionaire
in
his
private
office
a
servant
asked
for
ed
card
and
got
the
letter
instead
ed
was
sent
for
a
moment
later
and
found
vanderbilt
alone
with
the
letter
open
in
his
hand
pray
sit
down
er
jackson
ah
sit
down
jackson
by
the
opening
sentences
it
seems
to
be
a
letter
from
an
old
friend
allow
me
i
will
run
my
eye
through
it
he
says
he
says
why
who
is
it
he
turned
the
sheet
and
found
the
signature
alfred
fairchild
hm
fairchild
i
do
recall
the
name
but
that
is
nothing
a
thousand
names
have
gone
from
me

but
it
good
oh
it
rare
i
do
quite
remember
it
but
i
seem
to
it

back
to
me
presently
he
says
he
says
hm
but
that
was
a
game
oh
how
it
carries
me
back
it
all
dim
of
course
it
a
long
time
ago
and
the
names
some
of
the
names
are
wavery
and
indistinct
but
sho
i
know
it
happened

can
feel
it
and
lord

it
warms
my
heart
and
brings
back

lost
youth

the
tired
spirit
of

man
and

for

lad

my
guest

at
any
hotel
in
new
york
sit
where
you
are
a
little
while
till
i
get
through
with
these
people
then
we
go
home
i
take
care
of
you
my
boy
make
yourself
easy
as
to
that
ed
stayed
a
week
and
had
an
immense
time
and
never
suspected
that
the
commodore
shrewd
eye
was
on
him
and
that
he
was
daily
being
weighed
and
measured
and
analyzed
and
tried
and
tested
yes
he
had
an
immense
time
and
never
wrote
home
but
saved
it
all
up
to
tell
when
he
should
get
back
twice
with
proper
modesty
and
decency
he
proposed
to
end
his
visit
but
the
commodore
said
no
wait
leave
it
to
me
i
tell
you
when
to
go
in
those
days
the
commodore
was
making
some
of
those
vast
combinations
of
his
consolidations
of
warring
odds
and
ends
of
railroads
into
harmonious
systems
and
concentrations
of
floating
and
rudderless
commerce
in
effective
centers
and
among
other
things
his
farseeing
eye
had
detected
the
convergence
of
that
huge
already
spoken
of
toward
memphis
and
he
had
resolved
to
set
his
grasp
upon
it
and
make
it
his
own
the
week
came
to
an
end
then
the
commodore
said
now
you
can
start
home
but
first
we
will
have
some
more
talk
about
that
tobacco
matter
i
know
you
now
i
know
your
abilities
as
well
as
you
know
them
yourself
perhaps
better
you
understand
that
tobacco
matter
you
understand
that
i
am
going
to
take
possession
of
it
and
you
also
understand
the
plans
which
i
have
matured
for
doing
it
what
i
want
is
a
man
who
knows
my
mind
and
is
qualified
to
represent
me
in
memphis
and
be
in
supreme
command
of
that
important
business
and
i
appoint
you
me
yes
your
salary
will
be
high
of
you
are
representing
me
later
you
will
earn
increases
of
it
and
will
get
them
you
will
need
a
small
army
of
assistants
choose
them
yourself
and
carefully
take
no
man
for
friendship
sake
but
all
things
being
equal
take
the
man
you
know
take
your
friend
in
preference
to
the
stranger
after
some
further
talk
under
this
head
the
commodore
said
my
boy
and
thank
alf
for
me
for
sending
you
to
me
when
ed
reached
memphis
he
rushed
down
to
the
wharf
in
a
fever
to
tell
his
great
news
and
thank
the
boys
over
and
over
again
for
thinking
to
give
him
the
letter
to
vanderbilt
it
happened
to
be
one
of
those
idle
times
blazing
hot
noonday
and
no
sign
of
life
on
the
wharf
but
as
ed
threaded
his
way
among
the
freight
piles
he
saw
a
white
linen
figure
stretched
in
slumber
upon
a
pile
of
under
an
awning
and
said
to
himself
that
one
of
them
and
hastened
his
step
next
he
said
it
charley
it
fairchild
good
and
the
next
moment
laid
an
affectionate
hand
on
the
sleeper
shoulder
the
eyes
opened
lazily
took
one
glance
the
face
blanched
the
form
whirled
itself
from
the
and
in
an
instant
ed
was
alone
and
fairchild
was
flying
for
the
like
the
wind
ed
was
dazed
stupefied
was
fairchild
crazy
what
could
be
the
meaning
of
this
he
started
slow
and
dreamily
down
toward
the
turned
the
corner
of
a
and
came
suddenly
upon
two
of
the
boys
they
were
lightly
laughing
over
some
pleasant
matter
they
heard
his
step
and
glanced
up
just
as
he
discovered
them
the
laugh
died
abruptly
and
before
ed
could
speak
they
were
off
and
sailing
over
barrels
and
bales
like
hunted
deer
again
ed
was
paralyzed
had
the
boys
all
gone
mad
what
could
be
the
explanation
of
this
extraordinary
conduct
and
so
dreaming
along
he
reached
the
and
stepped
aboard
nothing
but
silence
there
and
vacancy
he
crossed
the
deck
turned
the
corner
to
go
down
the
outer
guard
heard
a
fervent
o
lord
and
saw
a
white
linen
form
plunge
overboard
the
youth
came
up
coughing
and
strangling
and
cried
out
go
from
here
you
let
me
alone
i
did
do
it
i
swear
i
did
did
do
what
give
you
the
never
mind
what
you
did
do
come
out
of
that
what
makes
you
all
act
so
what
have
i
done
you
why
you
have
done
anything
but
well
then
what
have
you
got
against
me
what
do
you
all
treat
me
so
for
i
er
but
have
you
got
anything
against
us
of
course
not
what
put
such
a
thing
into
your
head
honor
bright
you
have
honor
bright
swear
it
i
do
know
what
in
the
world
you
mean
but
i
swear
it
anyway
and
you
shake
hands
with
me
goodness
knows
i
be
glad
to
why
i
just
starving
to
shake
hands
with
somebody
the
swimmer
muttered
hang
him
he
smelt
a
rat
and
never
delivered
the
letter
but
it
all
right
i
not
going
to
fetch
up
the
subject
and
he
crawled
out
and
came
dripping
and
draining
to
shake
hands
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
conspirators
showed
up
cautiously
armed
to
the
teeth
took
in
the
amicable
situation
then
ventured
warily
forward
and
joined
the
and
to
ed
eager
inquiry
as
to
what
made
them
act
as
they
had
been
acting
they
answered
evasively
and
pretended
that
they
had
put
it
up
as
a
joke
to
see
what
he
would
do
it
was
the
best
explanation
they
could
invent
at
such
short
notice
and
each
said
to
himself
he
never
delivered
that
letter
and
the
joke
is
on
us
if
he
only
knew
it
or
we
were
dull
enough
to
come
out
and
tell
then
of
course
they
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
trip
and
he
said
come
right
up
on
the
boiler
deck
and
order
the
drinks
it
my
treat
i
going
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
it
my
treat
again
and
we
have
oysters
and
a
time
when
the
drinks
were
brought
and
cigars
lighted
ed
said
well
when
i
delivered
the
letter
to
vanderbilt
great
scott
gracious
how
you
scared
me
what
the
matter
oh
er
nothing
nothing
it
was
a
tack
in
the
said
one
but
you
all
said
it
however
no
matter
when
i
delivered
the
letter
did
you
deliver
it
and
they
looked
at
each
other
as
people
might
who
thought
that
maybe
they
were
dreaming
then
they
settled
to
listening
and
as
the
story
deepened
and
its
marvels
grew
the
amazement
of
it
made
them
dumb
and
the
interest
of
it
took
their
breath
they
hardly
uttered
a
whisper
during
two
hours
but
sat
like
petrifactions
and
drank
in
the
immortal
romance
at
last
the
tale
was
ended
and
ed
said
and
it
all
owing
to
you
boys
and
you
never
find
me
ungrateful

your
hearts

the
annals
of
tasmania
in
whose
shadow
we
were
sailing
are
lurid
with
that
feature
tasmania
was
a
in
old
times
this
has
been
indicated
in
the
account
of
the

where
reference
is
made
to
vain
attempts
of
desperate
convicts
to
win
to
permanent
freedom
after
escaping
from
macquarrie
harbor
and
the
gates
of
hell
in
the
early
days
tasmania
had
a
great
population
of
convicts
of
both
sexes
and
all
ages
and
a
bitter
hard
life
they
had
in
one
spot
there
was
a
settlement
of
juvenile
convicts
children
who
had
been
sent
thither
from
their
home
and
their
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the

to
expiate
their
crimes
in
due
course
our
ship
entered
the
estuary
called
the
derwent
at
whose
head
stands
hobart
the
capital
of
tasmania
the
derwent
shores
furnish
scenery
of
an
interesting
sort
the
historian
laurie
whose
book
the
story
of
australasia
is
just
out
invoices
its
features
with
considerable
truth
and
intemperance
the
marvelous
picturesqueness
of
every
point
of
view
combined
with
the
clear
balmy
atmosphere
and
the
transparency
of
the
ocean
depths
must
have
delighted
and
deeply
impressed
the
early
explorers
if
the
coasts
sullen
defiant
and
lowering
seemed
uninviting
these
were
occasionally
broken
into
charmingly
alluring
coves
floored
with
golden
sand
clad
with
evergreen
shrubbery
and
adorned
with
every
variety
of
indigenous
wattle
wild
flower
and
fern
from
the
delicately
graceful
to
the
man
while
the
majestic
clean
and
smooth
as
the
mast
of
tall
admiral
pierces
the
clear
air
to
the
height
of
feet
or
more
it
looked
so
to
me
coasting
along
tasman
peninsula
what
a
shock
of
pleasant
wonder
must
have
struck
the
early
mariner
on
suddenly
sighting
cape
pillar
with
its
cluster
of
basaltic
columns
rising
to
a
height
of
feet
the
hydra
head
wreathed
in
a
turban
of
fleecy
cloud
the
base
lashed
by
jealous
waves
spouting
angry
fountains
of
foam
that
is
well
enough
but
i
did
not
suppose
those
snags
were
feet
high
still
they
were
a
very
fine
show
they
stood
boldly
out
by
themselves
and
made
a
fascinatingly
odd
spectacle
but
there
was
nothing
about
their
appearance
to
suggest
the
heads
of
a
hydra
they
looked
like
a
row
of
lofty
slabs
with
their
upper
ends
tapered
to
the
shape
of
a
point
in
fact
the
early
voyager
ignorant
of
their
great
height
might
have
mistaken
them
for
a
rusty
old
rank
of
piles
that
had
sagged
this
way
and
that
out
of
the
perpendicular
the
peninsula
is
lofty
rocky
and
densely
clothed
with
scrub
or
brush
or
both
it
is
joined
to
the
main
by
a
low
neck
at
this
junction
was
formerly
a
convict
station
called
port
arthur
a
place
hard
to
escape
from
behind
it
was
the
wilderness
of
scrub
in
which
a
fugitive
would
soon
starve
in
front
was
the
narrow
neck
with
a
cordon
of
chained
dogs
across
it
and
a
line
of
lanterns
and
a
fence
of
living
guards
armed
we
saw
the
place
as
we
swept
by
that
is
we
had
a
glimpse
of
what
we
were
told
was
the
entrance
to
port
arthur
the
glimpse
was
worth
something
as
a
remembrancer
but
that
was
all
the
voyage
thence
up
the
derwent
frith
displays
a
grand
succession
of
fairy
visions
in
its
entire
length
elsewhere
unequaled
in
gliding
over
the
deep
blue
sea
studded
with
lovely
islets
luxuriant
to
the
edge
one
is
at
a
loss
which
scene
to
choose
for
contemplation
and
to
admire
most
when
the
huon
and
bruni
have
been
passed
there
seems
no
possible
chance
of
a
rival
but
suddenly
mount
wellington
massive
and
noble
like
his
brother
etna
literally
heaves
in
sight
sternly
guarded
on
either
hand
by
mounts
nelson
and
rumney
presently
we
arrive
at
sullivan
cove
hobart
it
is
an
attractive
town
it
sits
on
low
hills
that
slope
to
the
harbor
a
harbor
that
looks
like
a
river
and
is
as
smooth
as
one
its
still
surface
is
pictured
with
dainty
reflections
of
boats
and
grassy
banks
and
luxuriant
foliage
back
of
the
town
rise
highlands
that
are
clothed
in
woodland
loveliness
and
over
the
way
is
that
noble
mountain
wellington
a
stately
bulk
a
most
majestic
pile
how
beautiful
is
the
whole
region
for
form
and
grouping
and
opulence
and
freshness
of
foliage
and
variety
of
color
and
grace
and
shapeliness
of
the
hills
the
capes
the
promontories
and
then
the
splendor
of
the
sunlight
the
dim
rich
distances
the
charm
of
the
and
it
was
in
this
paradise
that
the
convicts
were
landed
and
the
quartered
and
the
wanton
slaughter
of
the
black
innocents
consummated
on
that
autumn
day
in
may
in
the
brutish
old
time
it
was
all
out
of
keeping
with
the
place
a
sort
of
bringing
of
heaven
and
hell
together
the
remembrance
of
this
paradise
reminds
me
that
it
was
at
hobart
that
we
struck
the
head
of
the
procession
of
junior
englands
we
were
to
encounter
other
sections
of
it
in
new
zealand
presently
and
others
later
in
natal
wherever
the
exiled
englishman
can
find
in
his
new
home
resemblances
to
his
old
one
he
is
touched
to
the
marrow
of
his
being
the
love
that
is
in
his
heart
inspires
his
imagination
and
these
allied
forces
transfigure
those
resemblances
into
authentic
duplicates
of
the
revered
originals
it
is
beautiful
the
feeling
which
works
this
enchantment
and
it
compels
one
homage
compels
it
and
also
compels
one
assent
compels
it
always
even
when
as
happens
sometimes
one
does
not
see
the
resemblances
as
clearly
as
does
the
exile
who
is
pointing
them
out
the
resemblances
do
exist
it
is
quite
true
and
often
they
cunningly
approximate
the
originals
but
after
all
in
the
matter
of
certain
physical
patent
rights
there
is
only
one
england
now
that
i
have
sampled
the
globe
i
am
not
in
doubt
there
is
a
beauty
of
switzerland
and
it
is
repeated
in
the
glaciers
and
snowy
ranges
of
many
parts
of
the
earth
there
is
a
beauty
of
the
fiord
and
it
is
repeated
in
new
zealand
and
alaska
there
is
a
beauty
of
hawaii
and
it
is
repeated
in
ten
thousand
islands
of
the
southern
seas
there
is
a
beauty
of
the
prairie
and
the
plain
and
it
is
repeated
here
and
there
in
the
earth
each
of
these
is
worshipful
each
is
perfect
in
its
way
yet
holds
no
monopoly
of
its
beauty
but
that
beauty
which
is
england
is
alone
it
has
no
duplicate
it
is
made
up
of
very
simple
details
just
grass
and
trees
and
shrubs
and
roads
and
hedges
and
gardens
and
houses
and
vines
and
churches
and
castles
and
here
and
there
a
ruin
and
over
it
all
a
mellow
of
history
but
its
beauty
is
incomparable
and
all
its
own
hobart
has
a
peculiarity
it
is
the
neatest
town
that
the
sun
shines
on
and
i
incline
to
believe
that
it
is
also
the
cleanest
however
that
may
be
its
supremacy
in
neatness
is
not
to
be
questioned
there
can
not
be
another
town
in
the
world
that
has
no
shabby
exteriors
no
rickety
gates
and
fences
no
neglected
houses
crumbling
to
ruin
no
crazy
and
unsightly
sheds
no
of
the
poor
no
littered
with
tin
cans
and
old
boots
and
empty
bottles
no
rubbish
in
the
gutters
no
clutter
on
the
sidewalks
no
fraying
out
into
dirty
lanes
and
huts
no
in
hobart
all
the
aspects
are
tidy
and
all
a
comfort
to
the
eye
the
modestest
cottage
looks
combed
and
brushed
and
has
its
vines
its
flowers
its
neat
fence
its
neat
gate
its
comely
cat
asleep
on
the
window
ledge
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
museum
by
courtesy
of
the
american
gentleman
who
is
curator
of
it
it
has
samples
of
different
kinds
of
marsupials
a
marsupial
is
a
plantigrade
vertebrate
whose
specialty
is
its
pocket
in
some
countries
it
is
extinct
in
the
others
it
is
rare
the
first
american
marsupials
were
stephen
girard
aston
and
the
opossum
the
principal
marsupials
of
the
southern
hemisphere
are
rhodes
and
the
kangaroo
i
myself
am
the
latest
marsupial
also
i
might
boast
that
i
have
the
largest
pocket
of
them
all
but
there
is
nothing
in
that
one
the
tasmanian
devil
that
is
i
think
he
was
one
of
them
and
there
was
a
fish
with
lungs
when
the
water
dries
up
it
can
live
in
the
mud
most
curious
of
all
was
a
parrot
that
kills
sheep
on
one
great
this
bird
killed
a
thousand
sheep
in
a
whole
year
he
does
want
the
whole
sheep
but
only
the
this
restricted
taste
makes
him
an
expensive
bird
to
support
to
get
the
fat
he
drives
his
beak
in
and
rips
it
out
the
wound
is
mortal
this
parrot
furnishes
a
notable
example
of
evolution
brought
about
by
changed
conditions
when
the
sheep
culture
was
introduced
it
presently
brought
famine
to
the
parrot
by
exterminating
a
kind
of
grub
which
had
always
thitherto
been
the
parrot
diet
the
miseries
of
hunger
made
the
bird
willing
to
eat
raw
flesh
since
it
could
get
no
other
food
and
it
began
to
pick
remnants
of
meat
from
sheep
skins
hung
out
on
the
fences
to
dry
it
soon
came
to
prefer
sheep
meat
to
any
other
food
and
by
and
by
it
came
to
prefer
the
to
any
other
detail
of
the
sheep
the
parrot
bill
was
not
well
shaped
for
digging
out
the
fat
but
nature
fixed
that
matter
she
altered
the
bill
shape
and
now
the
parrot
can
dig
out
better
than
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
anybody
else
for
that
matter
even
an
admiral
and
there
was
another
curiosity
quite
a
stunning
one
i
thought
and
knives
just
like
those
which
primeval
man
made
out
of
flint
and
thought
he
had
done
such
a
wonderful
thing
yes
and
has
been
humored
and
coddled
in
that
superstition
by
this
age
of
admiring
scientists
until
there
is
probably
no
living
with
him
in
the
other
world
by
now
yet
here
is
his
finest
and
nicest
work
exactly
duplicated
in
our
day
and
by
people
who
have
never
heard
of
him
or
his
works
by
aborigines
who
lived
in
the
islands
of
these
seas
within
our
time
and
they
not
only
duplicated
those
works
of
art
but
did
it
in
the
brittlest
and
most
treacherous
of
substances
glass
made
them
out
of
old
brandy
bottles
flung
out
of
the
british
camps
millions
of
tons
of
them
it
is
time
for
primeval
man
to
make
a
little
less
noise
now
he
has
had
his
day
he
is
not
what
he
used
to
be
we
had
a
drive
through
a
bloomy
and
odorous
to
the
refuge
for
the
indigent
a
spacious
and
comfortable
home
with
hospitals
for
both
sexes
there
was
a
crowd
in
there
of
the
oldest
people
i
have
ever
seen
it
was
like
being
suddenly
set
down
in
a
new
world
a
weird
world
where
youth
has
never
been
a
world
sacred
to
age
and
bowed
forms
and
wrinkles
out
of
the
persons
present
were
and
could
have
told
stirring
tales
no
doubt
if
they
had
been
minded
to
talk
of
the
were
past
and
several
were
close
upon
the
average
age
at
death
there
is
years
as
for
me
i
have
no
use
for
that
place
it
is
too
healthy
seventy
is
old
enough
after
that
there
is
too
much
risk
youth
and
gaiety
might
vanish
any
day
and
then
what
is
left
death
in
life
death
without
its
privileges
death
without
its
benefits
there
were
women
in
that
refuge
and
of
them
were
the
steamer
disappointed
us
instead
of
making
a
long
visit
at
hobart
as
usual
she
made
a
short
one
so
we
got
but
a
glimpse
of
tasmania
and
then
moved
on
